"A year's plan starts in spring," and this is especially true for agricultural production. Doing a good job in spring planting plays a decisive role in striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture.

According to the requirement that the total sown area of various crops this year should not be less than 2.2 billion mu, and the grain crop area should not be less than 1.6 billion mu, the area of spring-sown grain crops this year is estimated to be close to 800 million mu. Calculated according to the average yield per mu of grain crops for the whole year, the total output of spring-sown crops will account for more than half of the planned total output of 1,050 billion jin for the whole year. In many places in some provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, because only one crop is harvested a year, the total output of spring-sown crops is almost the total output for the whole year. The yield per mu of spring-sown grain crops is generally higher than that of summer-sown crops. Cotton, peanuts, and other crops are all spring-sown crops. Therefore, the yield of spring-sown crops is of decisive significance for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

This year, all regions have made considerable achievements in the preparation for spring planting. The spring-sown area with irrigation facilities accounts for more than half of the total irrigated area in the country; the area of land that has been deep-plowed is nearly 300 million mu; the various improved farm tools promoted last year have reached more than 350 million pieces; the seeds reserved are generally more abundant than in previous years; and the mass movement of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer has been vigorously launched. However, we must also see that the quantity and quality of accumulated and manufactured fertilizer are far from meeting the needs of this year's leap forward in agricultural production; about 60% of the land that has been deep-plowed has not been fertilized. In addition to deep-plowed land, many ordinary lands have not been cultivated; since the beginning of last winter, there has been little rain and snow, and winter irrigation has been slow. The spring planting tools in some places have not been inspected and repaired. Judging from these situations, the task of preparing for spring planting is still very arduous.

Taking the initiative in agricultural production and not missing the farming season is a basic principle to ensure a bumper harvest. The experience of various regions in leading the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 has also repeatedly proved that seizing the opportunity early can gain the initiative, while seizing it late will lead to passivity, and one step of passivity will often lead to step-by-step passivity. When summing up the experience of leading agricultural production, Gucheng County in Hubei Province profoundly realized that in previous years, it was often "digging ditches when the water arrives," and the work was very passive. In 1958, starting early and planning early, one early leads to a hundred earlies, and gaining the initiative completely changed the situation. Therefore, seizing the time, seizing the season, grasping early, grasping quickly, grasping tightly, and grasping well are particularly important in this tense battle task of spring plowing and sowing. The agricultural production plan of the people's commune must be arranged to the team, to the land, and to the people as soon as possible. All labor, tools, seeds, base fertilizer, land preparation, and irrigation conditions related to spring planting must be prepared before the arrival of spring planting.

Now, the time to spring planting is less than a month away in the south and more than a month away in the north. Last year's experience proved that to do a good job in various preparatory work in a very short period, we must have the spirit of hard work. Last year's hard work started with water conservancy construction in the winter before last. In terms of water conservancy construction, a winter and a spring of hard work expanded the irrigated area by 480 million mu, which is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both at home and abroad. We also carried out hard work in striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops. Although summer crops encountered a severe drought, we finally overcame the drought and ensured a bumper harvest, and the total wheat output in the country exceeded that of the United States. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting, we faced two major tasks: one was to undertake the autumn harvest and deep plowing work, which was much larger than in previous years, and the other was to draw a large number of laborers to support the iron and steel front. These two tasks were very arduous. However, because we had the people's commune and carried out hard work, we not only ensured a bumper harvest of autumn crops, and most of the autumn-sown crops were planted on land that had already been deep-plowed, but also ensured the early completion of the iron and steel production tasks. After a year of hard work last year, people deeply realized that in a country like ours where the level of agricultural technology and equipment is still relatively backward, to make agricultural production grow rapidly, we must carry out hard work. Most farmers have already had this experience, and their slogan is: "Great efforts and hard work create miracles!" Now, the vast number of farmers are working hard to prepare sufficient fertilizer for grain and cotton. Of course, the hard work we are talking about is hard work with rhythm, both hard work and rest, and we must ensure a certain amount of rest time and sleep time during hard work. During the busy farming season, we must also ensure eight hours of sleep time and four hours of eating and learning time every day.

After having the spirit of hard work, we must also have clever ways of doing things. The period for timely sowing of crops is very short, and it requires relatively concentrated use of labor and animal power. In order to supplement the lack of labor, we should pay attention to organizing non-agricultural labor, auxiliary labor, and other aspects of labor that can participate in spring plowing production into the spring plowing and sowing movement. But to truly solve the problem of insufficient labor, we must start from two aspects: one is to pay attention to rectifying the labor organization. Reasonable labor arrangements can better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production, which is an important way to improve labor efficiency. One is to engage in tool reform on a large scale. According to materials from many places, labor productivity can be increased by 50% to 100% after tool reform. Now, we should closely combine the needs of spring plowing and spring sowing to carry out tool reform, and first reduce the most arduous labor burden that occupies the most labor. For example, new tools for transporting fertilizer and transplanting rice seedlings should be manufactured and promoted as soon as possible. All regions should also seize the opportunity to establish county, commune, and team farm tool manufacturing and repair plants as soon as possible, which is not only to prepare for the needs of spring plowing and sowing, but also to prepare better conditions for the great leap forward in agriculture for the whole year and for the long term.

When preparing for spring planting, we should pay attention to how to implement the problem of changing shallow plowing and extensive cultivation, extensive planting and low yield to deep plowing and intensive cultivation, and less planting and more yield in a planned and step-by-step manner. This is a fundamental principle of our agricultural production. Only after this principle is realized can we change the situation of 200 to 300 million laborers working for more than 600 million people, can we better implement the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military in the commune, and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and can we take a big step forward on the road to industrialization. However, this principle must be implemented in a step-by-step manner. Deep plowing and intensive cultivation can be implemented now, but less planting cannot be implemented too early, and we should increase production first and then gradually reduce planting. Carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement this year is to prepare for realizing less planting and more yield. This year, all regions must ensure the completion of the national grain sowing plan, especially cotton, oil crops, and other cash crops. This year, not only should they not be planted less, but they should also expand the planting area in accordance with the national plan. The proportion of sowing area of various crops should also be determined when formulating the plan. Different crops require different preparations. When determining the proportion, we must start from the overall situation. That is to say, the proportion of sowing area of various crops must be appropriate. For example, the area sown with potatoes last year was a little more, and individual areas reached more than 50% of the sowing area. This year, it should be adjusted appropriately, but it should not be reduced too much. We can consider planting less in places where potatoes were overly concentrated last year, and planting more in other places where they were planted very little, because this is an indispensable food in people's lives. Other crops also have their own uses. If any one is missing, it may affect the daily life of the people.

In order to welcome spring planting, we should also conduct an inspection of various preparations in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter". Especially the fertilizer problem, the party committees at all levels must, in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council recently issued on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement, implement "fertilizer command", grasp fertilizer in a big way, and ensure that wheat and rape have sufficient topdressing, and spring-sown crops have sufficient base fertilizer and topdressing. The white land that has been deep-plowed but has not had time to be fertilized must also be fertilized during spring planting. In order to ensure that spring-sown crops can be sown and planted in a timely manner, areas that can still be winter-irrigated should vigorously carry out winter irrigation and pay attention to doing a good job in preserving soil moisture. For fields that have not been autumn-plowed and winter-plowed last year, spring plowing and spring harrowing must be carried out as early as possible in early spring, and the land should be carefully prepared. Although most areas made arrangements for spring sowing seeds during the autumn harvest last year, from the perspective of the requirements of large-scale high-yield, some places do not have pure and good enough seeds, and they still need to be carefully selected. The issue of agricultural tools should also attract everyone's serious attention. According to the reflections of some places, there is a great shortage of large and small agricultural tools, and the damage is also very serious. For example, in Hebei Province, 30% of the 800,000 iron waterwheels are damaged. If they are not repaired as soon as possible, it will be too late to grasp them temporarily. Whether it is large or small agricultural tools or water lifting tools, those that should be added should be added quickly, those that should be repaired should be repaired in time, and those that should return to the team should return to the team, so as to ensure the needs of spring plowing, spring sowing, and spring irrigation.

The goal of producing 1,000 jin of wheat per mu has been put forward, and the goal of producing 2,000 jin of rice per mu and 200 jin of cotton per mu is also becoming the goal of struggle for the people of the whole country. All people's communes should put forward their own goals of struggle in accordance with the spirit of 100% indicators, 120% measures, and 240% enthusiasm, immediately take measures, carry forward the soaring enthusiasm, and strive to achieve them.

After the Spring Festival, agricultural production will enter a very busy period. We must not only grasp the accumulation and manufacturing of fertilizer, but also do a good job in other spring planting preparations; we cannot relax the field management of overwintering crops, otherwise, it will affect the bumper harvest of summer crops; now is the key season for breeding livestock, and no matter whether it is agricultural or pastoral areas, we must also seize the time to do a good job in livestock mating; other work on the industrial and agricultural front cannot be stopped. In the face of such complex and tense tasks, the leading organs in various regions should conscientiously study the various tasks in their regions, make comprehensive arrangements, and take overall consideration. We believe that as long as we continue to implement the policy of putting politics in command and relying on the masses, exerting all our energy, working hard and cleverly, we will be able to do a better job in this year's preparations for farming and lay a solid foundation for realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture this year.

### 鼓足干劲，迎接春播！

    鼓足干劲，迎接春播！
    “一年之计在于春”，这对于农业生产来说更是如此。春播工作做得好，对于争取农业更大更好更全面的跃进，有着决定性的作用。
    根据今年各种作物的总播种面积不少于二十二亿亩、粮食作物面积不少于十六亿亩的要求，今年春播粮食作物的面积估计将接近八亿亩左右。按照全年粮食作物的平均单产计算，春播作物的总产量就要占今年全年计划总产量一万零五百亿斤的一半以上。若干省、市、自治区许多地方因为一年只收一季，春播作物的总产量几乎就是全年的总产量。春播的粮食作物的单产一般都高于夏播作物。棉花、花生等全部都是春播作物。因此，春播作物的产量对于全年的丰收是具有决定性的意义的。
    今年各地在春播准备工作方面，已经取得了不少成绩。已有灌溉设施的春播面积，约占全国总灌溉面积的一半以上；经过深翻地的面积将近三亿亩；去年推广的各种改良农具已达三亿五千多万件；种籽留的一般也比往年充足；全民积肥造肥运动，已蓬蓬勃勃地展开。但是，我们还要看到：积肥造肥的数量和质量，还远远不能满足今年农业生产上跃进的需要；已经深翻的土地还有60％左右没有结合进行施肥。除了深翻地以外，一般的地有好多还没有耕过；去年入冬以来雨雪稀少，冬灌工作进行缓慢。一些地方的春播工具还没有检查和修理。从这些情况看来，春播准备工作的任务，还是非常艰巨的。
    在农业生产上争取主动，不误农时，是保证丰收的一条基本原则。1958年各地领导农业大跃进的经验也一再证明了抓得早就能争取主动，抓得迟就会形成被动，而且一步被动就往往会形成步步被动的局面。湖北省谷城县在总结领导农业生产的经验的时候，就曾深刻地体会到往年常常是“水到现挖渠”，工作很被动。1958年早动手、早规划，一早百早，争得了主动，情况就完全改观。因此，抓时间，抢季节，早抓、快抓，抓紧抓好，在春耕播种这一场紧张的战斗任务中，显得特别重要。人民公社的农业生产计划必须及早安排到队到地到人，一切有关春播需要的劳动力、工具、种子、底肥、整地及灌溉条件等等都必须抓紧时间在春播到来之前准备妥当。
    现在离春播时间，南方不到一个月，北方一个多月。去年的经验证明，要在很短的时间内，做好各项准备工作，就要有苦战的精神。去年的苦战，是从前年冬季兴修水利开始的。在兴修水利方面，苦战了一冬一春，就扩大了灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，这是古今中外历史上找不到先例的。在争取夏收作物丰收中，也进行了苦战。夏收作物虽然遇到了严重的干旱，但是我们终于战胜了干旱，保证了丰收，而且使全国小麦的总产量超过了美国。在秋收秋种的时候，我们面临着两大任务：一是要担负起比往年工作量多得多的秋收工作和深翻地工作，一是要抽出大批劳动力，支援钢铁战线。这两个任务是非常艰巨的。但是，因为我们有了人民公社和进行了苦战，既保证了秋收作物丰产丰收，大部分秋播作物种上已经深翻过的土地上，又保证了钢铁生产任务提前完成。经过去年一年的苦战，人们深深体会到：在我国这样一个农业技术装备水平还比较落后的国家里，要使农业生产迅速增长，就必须进行苦战。多数农民对于这一点早已有了体会，他们的口号是：“大干苦干出奇迹！”现在广大农民正在为粮棉准备充足的肥料而苦战。当然，我们所说的苦战，是有节奏的苦战，既有苦战，也有休整，苦战中要保证一定的休息时间和睡觉时间。在农忙季节，也要保证每天有八小时睡觉时间、四小时吃饭、学习时间。
    有了苦干精神之后，还必需有巧干的办法。农作物适时播种的时期是很短的，需要比较集中使用劳力和畜力。为了补充劳力的不足，要注意组织非农业劳力、辅助劳力及其他方面能够参加春耕生产的劳动力投入春耕春播运动。但是要真正解决劳力不足的问题，还必须从两个方面下手：一个是注意整顿劳动组织。劳动力安排的合理，就能够更好地发挥广大群众的生产积极性，这是提高劳动效率的一个重要方法。一个是大搞工具改革。据许多地方材料证明，工具改革以后，可以提高劳动生产率50％到100％。现在就应该密切结合春耕春播的需要进行工具改革，首先把农活中最繁重的占用劳动力最多的劳动负担减轻下来。譬如运肥和插秧的新工具就应该加紧制造和推广。各地还应该抓紧时机早些建立县、社、队的农具制造厂和修配厂，这不但是为了准备春耕播种需要，也是为全年的和长期的农业大跃进准备更好的条件。
    在准备春播的时候，要注意如何有计划有步骤地实行改变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收的问题。这是我们农业生产的一个根本方针。只有在这个方针实现之后，才能够改变两、三亿个劳动力为六亿多人口搞饭吃的局面，才能够在公社中更好地实行工农商学兵结合，农林牧副渔全面发展，才能够在工业化道路上前进一大步。但是，这个方针必须有步骤地实行。深耕细作现在就可以开始实行，而少种则不能过早地实行，应先增产而后逐步少种。今年开展大面积的高额丰产运动，就是为实现少种多收作准备。今年各地必须保证国家粮食播种计划的完成，尤其是棉花、油料和其他经济作物，今年不但不能少种，而且要按照国家计划，扩大种植面积。各种作物播种面积的比例，在制定计划的时候也要确定下来。不同的作物，需要进行不同的准备工作。在确定比例的时候，一定要从全局出发。也就是说，各种作物的播种面积比例要定得适当。比如薯类去年播种的面积多了一点，个别地区达到了播种面积的50％以上。今年就应当加以适当的调整，但是也不能减少过多。可以考虑在去年种薯类过分集中的地方少种一些，而另外一些种得很少的地方多种一些，因为这是人民生活中不可缺少的一种食品。其他作物也都各有各的用处。如果缺了哪一种，都可能影响人民群众的日常生活。
    为了迎接春播，还应该根据“八字宪法”的要求，对各项准备工作，进行一次检查。特别是肥料问题，各级党委必须根据中共中央、国务院最近发布的关于开展积肥造肥运动的指示，实行“肥料挂帅”，大抓特抓肥料，作到小麦、油菜有充足的追肥，春播作物有充足的基肥和追肥。深翻后还没有来得及施肥的白地，也必须在春播时把肥料施进去。为了保证春播作物能够适时播种和栽插，目前还可以冬灌的地区仍要大力开展冬灌，注意作好保墒工作。没有冬灌的白地，应该根据当地具体情况，提早进行春灌，防止春旱。对于去年没有秋耕和冬耕的田地，必须在早春尽早地进行春耕春耙，精细整地。春播的种籽，去年大多数地区在秋收中虽然都作了安排，但从大面积高额丰产的要求来看，有些地方种子不够纯，不够好，还需要进行精选。农具问题也应引起大家严重注意。根据有些地方的反映，大小农具缺的很多，损坏的也很严重，如河北省铁制水车八十万部，损坏的占30％，如不及早修理，临时抓是来不及的。不论大小农具或提水工具，该增补的要赶快增补，该修理的要及时修理，该归队的就应该归队，以保证春耕、春播、春灌的需要。
    小麦亩产千斤的奋斗目标已经提出来了，水稻亩产双千斤，棉花亩产双百斤也正在成为全国人民的奋斗目标，所有人民公社都应该按照十分指标十二分措施二十四分干劲的精神，提出自己的奋斗目标，立即采取措施，发扬冲天干劲，务求实现。
    春节过后，农业生产就要进入一个十分繁忙的时期。既要抓好积肥造肥，又要作好其他春播准备工作；对越冬作物的田间管理工作也不能放松，否则，要影响夏收作物大丰收；现在正是繁殖牲畜的关键季节，不论农区牧区，还要抓紧做好牲畜配种工作；工业农业战线上的其他工作也不能都停下来。在这样复杂而紧张的任务面前，各地领导机关应当对本地区的各项工作认真加以研究，全面安排，统筹兼顾。我们相信：只要继续贯彻执行政治挂帅和依靠群众的方针，鼓足干劲，苦干加巧干，就一定能够把今年的备耕工作作得更好，为实现今年农业更大、更好、更全面的跃进打下巩固的基础。
