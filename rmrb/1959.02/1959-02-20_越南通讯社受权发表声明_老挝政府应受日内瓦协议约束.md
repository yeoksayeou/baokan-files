Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 19th: The Vietnam News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement on the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, saying that the Lao Kingdom Government's Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Natchampassak, stated on the 17th that the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos had been completed and that the Lao Kingdom Government had no intention of joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc. These words are intended to conceal the truth, deceive the Lao people and the public opinion of the Southeast Asian people, and cover up the ulterior motives of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary pro-American elements in Laos, as well as their preparations for launching a new war.

The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned malicious conspiracy will be exposed and condemned by the Lao people and the Southeast Asian people because it violates the interests of the Lao people and the peace-loving people of the Southeast Asian region.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's statement of February 15, 1959, has clearly pointed out that the Geneva Accords have not been fully implemented in Laos.

The statement said that recently, especially since the temporary cessation of activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, many U.S. military personnel and U.S. weapons have been imported into Laos, and new military bases have been established on Lao soil. In addition, some senior responsible persons in the Lao Kingdom Government have repeatedly declared that Laos is within the "protection area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive military bloc. Observers from the Lao Kingdom Government participated in all military exercises held by the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc in 1958 and early 1959.

The statement pointed out that the above actions and statements are obviously part of the entire conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the pro-American reactionary elements in Laos. They are working to undermine the Geneva Accords on the Laos issue and obstruct the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos so that U.S. imperialism can increasingly interfere in Laos, turn Laos into a U.S. military base, and finally drag Laos into the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc.

The statement emphasized that the Lao Kingdom Government cannot evade its responsibility for correctly and thoroughly implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords on the Laos issue, and the Lao Kingdom Government is still fully bound by the Geneva Accords.

The statement concluded that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos must exist and continue its activities in Laos in order to supervise the correct implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

    越南通讯社受权发表声明
    老挝政府应受日内瓦协议约束
    美帝国主义和老挝亲美派的阴谋将遭老挝人民谴责
    新华社河内19日电　越南通讯社今天受权发表关于日内瓦协议在老挝履行问题的声明说，老挝王国政府宣传副大臣纳占巴萨17日发表声明说，日内瓦协议在老挝的履行工作已经完成，老挝王国政府无意加入东南亚条约组织军事集团。这些话是为了掩盖事实真象，蒙蔽老挝人民和东南亚人民的舆论视听，并且遮盖美帝国主义和老挝的反动亲美分子不可告人的阴谋以及准备发动新的战争。
    声明指出，上述恶毒的阴谋将被老挝人民和东南亚人民所揭破和谴责。因为它违背了老挝人民和东南亚地区爱好和平的人民的利益。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府1959年2月15日的声明已经清楚地指出，日内瓦协议在老挝尚未充分履行。
    声明说，最近这一时期中，特别是在老挝国际监督和监察委员会暂时停止活动以来，有许多美国军事人员以及美国武器输入老挝，在老挝土地上建立新的军事基地。此外，老挝王国政府内的一些高级负责人士曾经一再宣称，老挝是处在东南亚条约组织侵略军事集团的“保护地区”之内。东南亚军事侵略集团1958年和1959年初所举行的所有军事演习都有老挝王国政府的观察员参加。
    声明指出，上述行动和言论很明显是美帝国主义和老挝的亲美反动分子的整个阴谋的一部分，他们正在努力破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并且阻挠老挝国际监督和监察委员会的活动，以便美帝国主义能够日益深入地干涉老挝，把老挝变成美国的军事基地，最后把老挝拖入东南亚军事侵略集团里。
    声明强调说，老挝王国政府回避不了它对正确、彻底地履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议各项条款所应负的责任，老挝王国政府仍然完全受日内瓦协议的约束。
    声明最后说，老挝国际监督和监察委员会必须在老挝存在和继续活动，以便监督日内瓦协议各项条款在老挝的正确履行。
