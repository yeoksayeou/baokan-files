A Heartening Prospect of a Greater Leap Forward

(Our Shanghai Dispatch, February 25th) In the crucial year of the three-year hard struggle, according to the planned targets, Shanghai's total industrial output value will increase by another 55% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This rate of growth exceeds last year's leap forward. The report made by Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Shanghai Municipal Committee's Industrial Conference today, presented a heartening prospect of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in Shanghai this year. According to the plan, Shanghai's steel production will increase to 1.6 million tons this year, and the production of machinery and electrical products will more than double. There will also be significant growth in the chemical, light, and textile industries. Comrade Ke Qingshi said that the completion of these leap forward plans plays an important role in the completion and over-completion of the national economic plan. Completing and over-completing the national plan is our greatest and highest interest. He called on the people of Shanghai to recognize their extremely glorious responsibility and obligation to the whole country, to go all out, aim high, liberate their minds, break down superstitions, and ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's Great Leap Forward plan.

Comrade Ke Qingshi said that Shanghai is one of China's existing important industrial bases. Therefore, the guiding principle of Shanghai's industrial production is: based on the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and the unified national plan, it is necessary to both meet the needs of the country and the people, and to develop in the direction of advanced, precise, large-scale, and cutting-edge industries. This year, Shanghai's industrial production, whether in terms of total output value, output, quality, or other aspects, must have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958.

Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that this year's greater leap forward is the inevitable development of last year's Great Leap Forward. Last year, Shanghai's industrial output value increased by 50.3% compared to the previous year, among which the machinery and electrical industries, which played an important role in ensuring national construction, more than doubled. The output of major products such as steel, heavy machinery, turbo-generators, AC motors, transformers, and machine tools increased by one to seven times last year. Comrade Ke Qingshi said that last year's Great Leap Forward was not only reflected in the rapid growth of material wealth, but also in the significant changes in people's mental outlook, and the unprecedented upsurge of socialist and communist ideological awareness. Thus, last year's Great Leap Forward created a situation for this year's greater leap forward, pointed out the direction, found the methods, and laid the foundation. Last year's Great Leap Forward was the great victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, the great victory of the Party's and the people's rectification campaign, and the great victory of the Party's mass line.

Realizing a Greater Leap Forward is Not Only Necessary, But Also Completely Possible

Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that completing and over-completing this year's leap forward plan is not only necessary but also completely possible. Because Shanghai not only has the same favorable conditions as all parts of the country, but also has its own unique favorable conditions. Comrade Ke Qingshi said: As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech on the 20th, these common favorable conditions are: (1) The masses are full of energy and enthusiasm; (2) We have the valuable experience of realizing the Great Leap Forward last year; (3) This year's targets are more realistic, and their formulation is based on and takes into account various conditions, but they are also "fruits that can be picked by jumping a little"; (4) The situation of this year's Great Leap Forward came early, and it was launched from the beginning of the year; (5) With the people's communes, the country can better incorporate all the people's activities into planning; (6) There is a leadership method of grasping several times a year. In addition to this, Shanghai also has its own unique favorable conditions, which are: (1) The production capacity of the expanded and newly built enterprises last year has been put into production, and the production capacity has increased; (2) The ranks of the working class have expanded, and the production skills of new and old workers are more skilled than last year; (3) Shanghai's production technology level has been greatly improved in last year's Great Leap Forward. More than 10,000 new products were successfully trial-produced in Shanghai last year; many products that were unimaginable in the past were successfully trial-produced last year. Cadres and workers have gained experience in trial-producing new products, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and undertaking large-scale and heavy-duty equipment tasks, and are more daring to act than last year. Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that since it is a leap forward, there will of course be difficulties, because there is no leap forward that does not encounter difficulties. But as long as we resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's line and policies, resolutely rely on the masses, and give full play to favorable conditions, any difficulties can be overcome and reduced.

Comrade Ke Qingshi particularly pointed out that the completion of this year's leap forward plan will have an extremely important impact not only on Shanghai's leap forward this year, but also on the continued Great Leap Forward in the future. He said that the goal of China's socialist construction is to build China into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Since Shanghai is a comprehensive industrial city with a relatively high level of worker technology and a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the conditions are better, therefore, the Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai should be determined and make the greatest efforts to strive to achieve the production level proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which the whole country will reach after fifteen, twenty, or more years, so as to support the country in achieving the above-mentioned great goal earlier.

Strive for a 40% to 50% Increase in Labor Productivity

Comrade Ke Qingshi said: Achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and ensuring the completion and over-completion of the national plan, is to resolutely implement the instructions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on developing social productive forces at a high speed. There are two ways to develop social productive forces at a high speed in industry: one is to expand and build a number of industrial enterprises and increase the number of new workers; the other is to continuously improve the labor productivity of existing enterprises. From Shanghai's perspective, it is necessary to expand and build a number of key enterprises this year to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, but more importantly, to continuously improve the labor productivity of enterprises. This year, Shanghai's industry must complete a greater leap forward plan that is 55% higher than last year without increasing a single person, and strive to increase labor productivity by 40% to 50%. That is to say, it is required that the laboring people of Shanghai strive in terms of production skills and in creating wealth for the country for one person to equal one and a half people of last year, and one hour this year is equal to one and a half hours last year.

He said: Continuously improving labor productivity has great political and economic significance, which is the most important condition for socialism to defeat capitalism, build socialism, and transition to communism in the future. The increase in labor productivity marks the increase in social material wealth and the improvement of people's welfare. In the past few years, Shanghai's industrial labor productivity has been continuously improved. Calculated by all employees, it increased by 38% last year compared to the previous year; calculated by production workers, it increased by 26% last year compared to the previous year. But the increase is not enough, we are still very backward, and the labor productivity of some industries is even lower than that of domestic advanced factories in the same industry.

He said: The possibility of greatly improving labor productivity in Shanghai's industry is very great. First, Shanghai has a relatively strong technical force, with millions of industrial workers, most of whom are experienced and skilled old workers, and also have a large number of technical personnel. Second, from the perspective of improving the degree of mechanization, Shanghai still has great potential. Shanghai is an old industrial city, still using old soldiers and old guns, and the degree of mechanization is not high. Only 27% of workers in industrial enterprises in the city are engaged in mechanized operations, 36% are engaged in semi-mechanized operations, and 37% are still engaged in manual operations. If in the technical revolution this year, some necessary and possible reforms are made to the process of manual operation and semi-mechanized operation, the labor productivity of the whole city can be greatly improved. Third, Shanghai's industrial sectors are relatively complete, which is convenient for production collaboration and experience exchange. Production collaboration can not only give full play to production potential, but also create new production capacity. Fourth, the development of labor productivity between advanced enterprises and backward enterprises in Shanghai's industry is unbalanced.

Make a Great Technical Revolution, Have the Ambition to Reach the Sky in One Step, and Do the Detailed Work of Climbing to the Sky Step by Step

He also said: To improve labor productivity, we should grasp these links. First, we must make a great technical revolution. Last year, Shanghai employees put forward more than 470,000 suggestions related to technical revolution and technical innovation, and more than 200,000 of them have been implemented, including 15,000 important reforms in four aspects: technology, equipment, product design, and raw materials. Technical revolution, like other revolutions, must be constantly revolutionized and endless. It must have the ambition to reach the sky in one step, and do the detailed work of climbing to the sky step by step according to different conditions. Second, we must improve labor organization and production organization, improve enterprise management level, and reduce the proportion of non-production personnel. Third, we must continuously improve the degree of mechanization, gradually update equipment, and replace old soldiers with new guns. Fourth, we must carry out a cultural revolution to serve the technical revolution in a serious, persistent, and in-depth manner. Not only should we improve the cultural level of workers and master basic science courses, but also give full play to the role of technical personnel, and achieve the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of technical personnel and workers.

He said: In addition to implementing the above four measures, it is also necessary to arrange production plans and collaboration relations well, and to grasp the supply of raw materials well. In addition to establishing a command headquarters in the city to grasp the transfer, allocation, and production of raw materials, we must also grasp the work of saving raw materials, developing the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, finding substitutes, and creating new raw materials.

Resolutely Implement the Principle of the Whole Country as One Chessboard, and Strengthen Communist Great Collaboration

Comrade Ke Qingshi particularly emphasized the need to implement the principle of the whole country as one chessboard, and strengthen the development of communist great collaboration with all parts of the country and between enterprises in the city. In the case of limited raw materials, first ensure the completion of the national plan; in the mobilization and use of materials, strictly obey the state's scheduling plan; at the same time, some products that are temporarily in short supply should be reasonably allocated according to the urgency of needs. Surplus materials should be subject to unified scheduling, and barter trade should be strictly prohibited. In order to implement the principle of the whole country as one chessboard, it is also necessary to strengthen communist collaboration with all parts of the country and between enterprises in the city. To this end, the original cooperative relationship between products within the national plan and supporting products must be maintained, and newly added cooperative relationships should be resolved through consultation based on production capacity and raw material supply; the cooperative relationship between enterprises in the city must be further strengthened. Comrade Ke Qingshi emphasized that the principle of the whole country as one chessboard is an active principle, which will not limit the enthusiasm that is conducive to the Great Leap Forward, but only limit the enthusiasm that is not conducive to the Great Leap Forward. This principle will undoubtedly play an active role in promoting Shanghai's industrial production.

Comrade Ke Qingshi emphatically pointed out: The vigor advocated by our Party is the combination of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. Hard work mainly refers to the spirit and perseverance of fighting hard against difficulties. It is impossible without the spirit of the Foolish Old Man moving mountains and Jingwei filling the sea. However, the Foolish Old Man and Jingwei are also doing things in a down-to-earth manner. We advocate soaring enthusiasm and also advocate being down-to-earth, that is, "standing upright". Skilful work is to make a great technical revolution. Combining these three, we can overcome all difficulties and be invincible.

Always Go All Out with Revolutionary Enthusiasm, Always Adhere to the Spirit of Rectification

Comrade Ke Qingshi emphasized in his report that implementing the Party's mass line and strengthening the Party's leadership are of great significance to realizing this year's greater leap forward plan. He said that only by strengthening the Party's leadership can we implement political command, launch mass movements in a big way, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized, and realize the various tasks we face. He pointed out that to mobilize the masses, the current key issue is still to go all out with revolutionary enthusiasm, first of all, cadres must go all out.

Comrade Ke Qingshi reviewed the situation of the changes in the thinking of cadres in the past year. He said: At the beginning of last year, at the Municipal Party Congress, we analyzed that there were three situations of cadres in Shanghai at that time: the first was those who had strong revolutionary will, full of energy, and able to find solutions; the second was those who were able to work and did not want to do bad things, but lacked the spirit of striving for strength and aggressive progress; the third was those who had a relatively heavy burden of individualism and whose thoughts began to mold. He said that after a year of rectification and practical exercise in the Great Leap Forward, the political consciousness, ideological style, and working methods of the broad masses of cadres have made significant progress. The number of the first type has greatly increased. However, "if you don't advance, you will retreat". If you are not always vigilant and become arrogant and complacent, the advanced may be transformed into backward. Comrade Ke Qingshi called on all cadres to adhere to the spirit of rectification, always maintain a humble and prudent attitude, constantly strictly demand themselves with communist standards, and strictly place themselves under the supervision of the Party and the masses, and constantly study hard. In this way, the backward will be transformed into advanced, and the advanced will be more advanced. He said that a worker's big-character poster said very well: the rectification movement is over, and the spirit of rectification can never be lost. This big-character poster is applicable to every one of our cadres.

Adhere to the Party's Mass Line on the Industrial Front

Comrade Ke Qingshi also pointed out that cadres have soaring enthusiasm, but also need to follow the mass line, so that they can lead the mass movement. Therefore, we must continue to get rid of official airs, mingle with the masses, and insist on going to the workshop to participate in physical labor. We must comprehensively care for the masses with the equal attitude of ordinary workers, care about their production, study, and life. We must have a real democratic style, consult with the masses in everything, so that the masses will overcome all difficulties with us. He said that the Party has gained more abundant experience in implementing the mass line on the industrial front in the past year. We should sum it up, adhere to it, and make it more developed. In last year's mass movement, some unreasonable rules and regulations were broken, which was completely necessary. But while breaking unreasonable rules and regulations, it is necessary to prevent and oppose anarchist ideas. There must be construction after destruction, and the purpose of destroying the old is to establish the new. Therefore, new and necessary rules and regulations should be established; it is impossible to do anything well without necessary rules and regulations.

Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out when talking about strengthening the Party's leadership: To give full play to the leading role of the Party committee means to concentrate leadership and divide responsibilities, and give play to the role of administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League. Without the unified leadership of the Party, various organizations cannot correctly play an active role; pushing various administrative tasks to the Party committee will also weaken the Party's leadership. He said that the correct approach should be what Comrade Xiaoping said: to ensure the unified leadership of the Party committee and to give play to the strength of various organizations under the unified leadership. Within the Party committee, it is a system of unified leadership and division of responsibility; in terms of administration, it is a system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. Only in this way can we strengthen the Party's leadership and grasp the whole work.

Comrade Ke Qingshi finally pointed out: Now, a mass movement on a larger scale than in 1958 is rising, and a new leap forward climax is coming. In order to boost the enthusiasm of the people of the city more fully and organize the endless power of the masses, he proposed on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee to launch a vigorous and great red flag competition in all industries in the city, seize every favorable opportunity, put forward clear slogans to encourage the masses to continue to leap forward, and fight wave after wave to over-fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Central Committee.

    高速度地发展社会生产力
    上海今年工业产值将增长百分之五十五
    柯庆施同志号召不断提高劳动生产率
    争取一个人抵得上去年的一个半人
    一幅振奋人心的更大跃进的前景
    本报上海25日电　在苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，根据拟订的计划，上海工业生产总值将比大跃进的1958年再增长55％。这一增长速度，超过了去年的跃进幅度。中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志今天在中共上海市委工业会议上所作的报告，展示了一幅振奋人心的上海今年更大更好更全面跃进的前景。根据拟订的计划，今年上海钢产量将增加到一百六十万吨，机械、电机生产将增长一倍以上。化工、轻、纺织等工业也有很大的增长。柯庆施同志说，各个跃进计划的完成，对全国国民经济计划的完成和超额完成，有重要的作用。完成和超额完成国家计划，是我们最大最高的利益。他号召上海劳动人民，一定要认识自己对全国担负着的极其光荣的责任和义务，鼓足干劲，力争上游，解放思想，破除迷信，保证完成和超额完成今年的大跃进计划。
    柯庆施同志说，上海是我国现有的重要工业基地之一。因此，上海工业生产的方针是：根据“全国一盘棋”的方针，根据国家的统一计划，既要满足国家和人民的需要，又要向高级、精密、大型、尖端的方向发展。上海工业生产不论在总产值、产量、质量或其他方面，今年都必须有一个比1958年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    柯庆施同志指出：今年的更大跃进，是去年大跃进的必然发展。去年上海工业产值比前年增长50.3％，其中对保证国家建设具有重要作用的机械、电机等工业增长一倍以上。主要产品如钢、重型机械、汽轮发电机、交流电动机、变压器、机床的产量，去年增长了一倍到七倍多。柯庆施同志说，去年的大跃进不仅表现在物质财富的迅速增长，还表现在人们精神面貌的显著改变，社会主义和共产主义思想觉悟空前高涨。这样，去年的大跃进就为今年的更大跃进造成了形势，指出了方向，找到了方法，打下了基础。去年的大跃进，是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利，是全党全民整风运动的伟大胜利和党的群众路线的伟大胜利的结果。
    实现更大跃进不仅必要，而且完全可能
    柯庆施同志指出，完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划不仅必要而且完全可能。因为上海不但具有和全国各地一样的有利条件，也具有本身特有的有利条件。柯庆施同志说：正如邓小平同志在20日讲话中所指出的这些共同的有利条件就是：（一）群众干劲十足热情很高；（二）有了去年实现大跃进的宝贵经验；（三）今年的指标更加实事求是，它的制订是根据并考虑了各方面的条件，但它又是需要“跳一跳才能摘下来的果子”；（四）今年的大跃进的形势来得很早，从年初就发动起来了；（五）有了人民公社，国家更能把全民活动更好纳入规划；（六）有了一年抓几次的领导方法。除此而外，上海还有其本身特有的有利条件，这就是：（一）有去年扩建、新建企业的生产能力投入生产，生产能力增长了；（二）工人阶级队伍扩大了，新老工人的生产技能比去年更加熟练；（三）上海生产技术水平在去年大跃进中大大提高。去年上海试制成功的新产品有一万多种；许多过去不敢设想的产品去年试制成功了。干部和工人群众在试制新产品、摸索尖端技术、承制大型、重型设备任务方面，由于闯出胆量有了经验，比去年更敢作敢为了。柯庆施同志指出，既要跃进，当然就有困难，因为天下没有不遇到困难的跃进。但是只要我们坚决贯彻党中央的路线和方针，坚决依靠群众，充分发挥有利条件，任何困难都是可以克服和减轻的。
    柯庆施同志特别指出，今年跃进计划的完成，不仅对上海今年的跃进而且对今后继续大跃进也有极重要的影响。他说，我国社会主义建设的目标，是把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义国家。由于上海是一个综合性工业城市，工人技术水平较高，又有光荣的革命传统，条件较好，因此，上海各级党组织应当有决心、尽最大的努力，争取早日实现党的八届六中全会所提出的全国在十五年、二十年或者更多一些时间之后达到的生产水平，以便支援全国提早实现上述伟大目标。
    争取劳动生产率增长40％到50％
    柯庆施同志说：实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，保证完成和超额完成国家计划，是为了坚决贯彻党的八届六中全会关于高速度地发展社会生产力的指示。在工业中高速度地发展社会生产力有两个办法，一是扩建新建若干工业企业和增加新的工人队伍；一是不断地提高原有企业的劳动生产率。从上海来说，今年必须扩建新建若干关键性的企业，以适应大跃进的需要，但是更重要的是不断提高企业的劳动生产率。今年上海工业要在不增加一个人的情况下完成比去年增长55％的更大的跃进计划，争取劳动生产率增长40％到50％。也就是说要求上海的劳动人民在生产技能上，在为国家创造财富上争取一个人抵得上去年的一个半人，今年的一小时等于去年的一小时半。
    他说：不断地提高劳动生产率有重大的政治意义和经济意义，这是社会主义战胜资本主义、建成社会主义、将来过渡到共产主义的最重要的条件。劳动生产率的增长，标志着社会物质财富的增加和人民福利的提高。几年来，上海工业劳动生产率不断有所提高，以全体职工计算，去年比前年增长38％；以生产工人计算，去年比前年增长26％。但是增长还不够，我们还很落后，而且某些行业的劳动生产率还低于同一行业的国内先进厂。
    他说：上海工业大大提高劳动生产率的可能性是很大的。一，上海技术力量比较雄厚，拥有百万产业工人，其中大多数是具有丰富的劳动经验和熟练的生产技能的老工人，而且还拥有数量较多的技术人员。二，从提高机械化程度看，上海尚有很大的潜力。上海是个老工业城市，还是老兵老枪，机械化程度还不高。全市工业企业工人从事机械化操作的仅占27％。半机械化操作的占36％，手工操作的还占37％。如果今年在技术革命过程中，将手工操作和半机械化操作的过程，作一些必要而又可能的改革，全市的劳动生产率就可以大大提高。三，上海工业各行业比较齐全，便于进行生产协作和经验交流。生产协作不仅可以充分发挥生产潜力，而且可以创造新的生产能力。四，现在全市先进企业与落后企业的劳动生产率的发展状况是不平衡的。
    大闹技术革命，要有一步登天的雄心，又要作步步登天的细致工作
    他又说：提高劳动生产率，应该抓这样一些环节。首先，要大闹技术革命。去年上海职工提出四十七万多件有关技术革命和技术革新的建议，已经实现了二十多万件，其中包括工艺、设备、产品设计、原材料等四个方面重要的改革有一万五千件。技术革命如同其他革命一样，要不断革命，永无止境，要有一步登天的雄心，又要根据不同条件，作步步登天的细致工作。其次，要改进劳动组织和生产组织，提高企业管理水平，缩小非生产人员比例。第三，要不断提高机械化程度，逐步更新设备，老兵换上新枪。第四，要认真、持久、深入地展开为技术革命服务的文化革命。不但要提高工人的文化水平，掌握基础科学课程，而且要充分发挥技术人员的作用，要做到理论和实际结合，技术人员和工人结合。
    他说：除了贯彻上述四项措施以外，还必需很好地安排生产计划和协作关系，要很好地抓原材料供应工作。除了全市成立指挥部，抓紧原材料的调运、调拨和生产以外，还要抓紧节约原材料、发展原材料的综合利用、找代用品和创造新原料等工作。
    坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，加强共产主义大协作
    柯庆施同志特别强调要贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，加强开展与全国各地和市内各企业之间的共产主义大协作。在原材料有限的情况下，首先保证完成国家计划；在物资的调动和使用上，应严格服从国家的调度计划；同时，对某些暂时供应紧张的产品，应根据需要的轻重缓急合理分配。多余的物资，应服从统一调度，严格禁止物物交换。为了贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，还需要加强与全国各地和市内各企业之间的共产主义协作。为此，国家计划内的产品和配套产品的原有协作关系，必须维持，新增加的协作关系，应根据生产能力和原材料供应情况协商解决；市内各企业之间的协作关系，必须进一步加强。柯庆施同志强调指出，全国一盘棋的方针是一个积极的方针，它不会限制那种有利于大跃进的积极性，只是限制那种不利于大跃进的积极性，这个方针，对上海的工业生产，无疑地将会起积极的促进的作用。
    柯庆施同志着重指出：我们党提倡的干劲是苦干、实干、巧干相结合。苦干主要是指同困难作艰苦斗争的气概和毅力，没有愚公移山、精卫填海的精神是不行的。但是，愚公、精卫也都是踏踏实实地作事情的。我们提倡干劲冲天，又提倡脚踏实地，也就是“顶天立地”，巧干，就是大闹技术革命。把这三者结合起来，我们就能百折不挠、无往而不胜。
    永远鼓足革命干劲，永远坚持整风精神
    柯施庆同志在报告中强调指出，贯彻执行党的群众路线和加强党的领导，对实现今年更大跃进计划的重要意义。他说，只有加强党的领导，才能实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，调动一切可以调动的力量，实现我们面临的各项任务。他指出：要把群众发动起来，当前的关键问题仍然是要鼓足革命干劲，首先是干部要鼓足干劲。
    柯庆施同志回述了一年来干部思想变化的形势。他说：去年年初，在市党代会上我们曾经分析过当时上海的干部有三种情况：第一种是革命意志旺盛，干劲很足而又能想办法的人；第二种是能够工作，也不愿做坏事，但是缺乏奋发图强、顽强进取的精神的人；第三种是个人主义包袱比较重，思想上开始发霉的人。他说，经过整风运动和大跃进的实践锻炼，一年来，广大干部的政治觉悟、思想作风和工作方法，都有了显著的进步。第一种人大为增加了。但是，“不进则退”，如果不时刻警惕，而骄傲自满起来，先进的可能转化为落后。柯庆施同志号召全体干部一定要坚持整风精神，时刻保持谦虚谨慎的态度，不断地以共产主义的标准严格地要求自己，并且把自己严格地放在党和群众的监督之下，不断地刻苦学习。这样，落后的会转化为先进，先进的更加先进。他说，有一张工人的大字报说的很好：整风运动是结束了，整风精神永远不能丢掉。这张大字报对我们每一个干部都是适用的。
    在工业战线上坚持执行党的群众路线
    柯庆施同志还指出：干部有了冲天干劲，还要走群众路线，这样才能把群众运动领导起来。因此，我们还要继续打掉官气。同群众打成一片，坚持下车间参加体力劳动。要以普通劳动者的平等态度全面地关心群众，关心他们的生产，学习，生活。要有真正的民主作风，凡事和群众商量，这样，群众就会和我们一道战胜一切困难。他说，党在工业战线上贯彻群众路线方面，一年来有了更为丰富的经验，我们应该总结起来，坚持下去，并且使它更加发展起来。在去年群众运动中，有些不合理的规章制度破了，这是完全必要的。但在破除不合理规章制度的同时，必须防止和反对无政府主义思想。有破还要有立，破旧是为了立新，因此，应该建立起新的必要的规章制度；没有必要的规章制度是不可能做好任何事情的。
    柯庆施同志在讲到加强党的领导时指出：要很好地发挥党委的领导作用，就是说既要集中领导，又要分工负责，发挥行政、工会、共青团的作用。没有党的统一领导，各种组织不可能正确地发挥积极作用；把各种事务工作推到党委来，也会削弱党的领导。他说，正确的作法，应当是小平同志所讲的：既要保证党委的统一领导，又要在统一领导下发挥各种组织的力量。在党委内部，是统一领导的分工负责制；在行政上说，是党委领导下的厂长负责制。只有这样，才能加强党的领导，把整个工作抓起来。
    柯庆施同志最后指出：现在，一个比1958年更大规模的群众运动正在兴起，一个新的跃进高潮正在到来。为了把全市人民的干劲鼓得更足，把群众无穷无尽的力量组织起来，他代表市委提议，在全市各行业中开展一个轰轰烈烈的伟大的红旗竞赛，抓住每个有利的时机，提出鲜明的鼓舞群众继续跃进的口号，一浪推一浪地为超额完成中央交给我们的各项光荣任务而斗争。
