Cenxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, this year’s fertilizer accumulation is characterized by early action, large scale, and attention to quality.

The county’s early rice fertilizer this year was started after autumn harvest in conjunction with deep plowing, and by mid-December, the movement entered a climax. During the climax, 120,000 people participated in fertilizer accumulation, including government cadres and urban residents. In key areas for fertilizer accumulation, people were collecting manure, gathering leaves, digging field pits, and transporting fertilizer to the fields. Now the county has accumulated more than 390 million dan of various fertilizers, an average of more than 1,200 dan of fertilizer per mu of paddy field, an increase of two times compared with the same period last year. The county also has 85,000 mu of green manure.

Taking a car from Yulin to Wuzhou, entering the territory of Cenxi County, you will see piles of fertilizer and manure pits dotted in the paddy fields, with signs of cadre and mass experiments. In the high-yield fields of the Nandou Dongfanghong People's Commune, there is a 38-zhang-long fertilizer "dragon," a fertilizer "lion" piled several zhang high, and a mu-sized manure pond.

The success of Cenxi County's fertilizer accumulation movement is first and foremost due to the full mobilization of the masses. At the beginning of the movement, some grassroots cadres and the masses had erroneous ideas of "no fertilizer theory" and "take it slowly." In order to solve these ideological problems, the county party committee's preliminary plan and increased production targets for a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959 were widely publicized throughout the county. Then, a great airing of views, great contending, and great debates were carried out among the masses, and forums of old farmers were held at the same time. Thus, digging for fertilizer formed a mass upsurge, and the county unearthed 40 kinds of fertilizer sources. The "no fertilizer theory" disappeared in the face of facts.

At the same time, the county carried out "one check" (checking how much fertilizer there is), "three accountings" (accounting for the need for fertilizer for increased production, accounting for the fertilizer accumulation task of each labor force, and accounting for the seasonal accounts), sweeping away some people's thoughts of "take it slowly."

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, methods of large-scale cooperation, large-scale concentration, and large-scale assault were also adopted according to local conditions, so that the movement developed vigorously. For example, the Nuodong Taiyang Commune concentrated 2,400 people, divided them into three battle zones in the Fengchan farmland, and carried out a large-scale fertilizer accumulation assault. In just five days, the average fertilizer accumulation was 1,500 dan per mu.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, the People's Communes also achieved rational division of labor (dividing work groups), assigning tasks, and implementing quota management, which further consolidated and improved the enthusiasm of the masses, making the movement develop more deeply. For example, the Malu Hongfeng People's Commune has quotas for each person and each group, and stipulates the requirements for specifications and quality. In the execution of tasks and quotas, the communes carried out comparisons of enthusiasm, attendance, work efficiency, and quality, and the work efficiency was greatly improved as a result.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, the communes attached importance to collecting farm manure and established some systems: (1) organizing commune members to collect the pig, cattle, chicken, and duck manure scattered at home and in the wild; (2) canteens handing over ash, commune members handing over human manure, and feeders handing over cow manure, chicken, and duck manure separately; (3) each production team and production group set up fertilizer collectors and fertilizer protectors, and implemented a "quantitative and regular fertilizer delivery" system for people and animals. (Gong Jingzhi, Li Yifang)

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th. The fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, has entered a new stage of grasping quality and grasping organic fertilizer.

Not long ago, the Huangzhong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an inspection of the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement and found that the amount of fertilizer in the previous stage increased rapidly, but most of it was inorganic fertilizer such as smoked soil and old wall soil, and organic fertilizer accounted for only 25%. The County Party Committee believes that more attention should be paid to grasping the quality of fertilizer in the future fertilizer accumulation movement. At present, all People's Communes are preparing to bulk ferment various organic fertilizers; at the same time, attention is paid to collecting organic fertilizers such as human and animal manure.

In order to make the organic fertilizer fermented in the cold winter ferment rapidly, the communes in Huangzhong County have adopted various methods to heat up the fertilizer. For example, steam heating, sun heating, and kiln heating. The raw materials for fertilizer fermentation include green grass, fallen leaves, garbage, wheat stalks, and vegetable stalks.

Due to the timely proposal of grasping fertilizer quality by the County Party Committee and the Party Committees of the Communes, organic fertilizer has recently risen to 30% to 40% of the fertilizer accumulated by most Communes. (Yang Liben)

    岑溪肥堆星罗棋布
    湟中抓有机肥料有成绩
    本报讯　今年广西僮族自治区岑溪县的积肥特点是动手早，规模大，注意质量。
    这个县今年的早造肥料，自去年秋后就结合深耕动手来搞，到12月中旬，运动进入高潮。在高潮时，参加积肥的有十二万人，其中包括机关干部、城镇居民。在积肥重点地区，收集家畜肥的、采集树叶的、挖田头坑的、运肥下田的人山人海。现在全县已积各种肥料三亿九千多万担，平均每亩水田有肥一千二百担以上，比去年同期增加了二倍。全县还种有绿肥八万五千多亩。
    乘玉林到梧州的汽车，进入岑溪县境内，就会看到水田里的堆肥、氹肥坑星罗棋布，到处插着干部和群众的试验氹和试验堆肥的牌子。在南渡东方红人民公社的高产田里，有三十八丈长的肥料“长龙”，有堆得几丈高的肥料“狮子”，还有亩大的氹肥塘。
    岑溪县的积肥运动搞得有成绩，首先是充分地发动了群众。运动开始，一些基层干部和群众存在着“无肥论”和“慢慢来”的错误思想。为了解决这些思想问题，在全县普遍宣传了县委提出的1959年农业更大跃进的初步规划和增产指标，接着在群众中开展了大鸣大放大辩论，同时召开了老农座谈会，于是挖掘肥料便形成了群众性的热潮，全县共挖掘肥源四十种。“无肥论”在事实面前消声匿迹。
    同时，在全县进行了“一查”（查有肥多少），“三算账”（算增产需肥账、算每个劳力积肥任务账、算季节账），扫除了一些人“慢慢来”的思想。
    在积肥运动中，还因地制宜地采取了大协作、大集中、大突击的方法，使运动猛烈地向前发展。如糯垌太阳公社集中了二千四百人，在丰产垌分成三个作战区，进行积肥大突击，仅五天积肥平均每亩有一千五百担。
    在积肥运动中，各人民公社还做到了合理分工（划分作业小组），分配任务，实行定额管理的办法，进一步巩固和提高了群众的积极性，使运动更加深入地发展了。如马路红风人民公社，每人、每个小组都有定额，并定出了规格质量要求。在执行任务和定额中，各公社开展了比干劲、比出工、比工效、比质量，工作效率因此大大提高。
    在积肥运动中，各公社都重视了收集农家肥，并建立了一些制度：（1）组织社员把散落在家里和野外的猪、牛、鸡鸭粪突击收拾起来；（2）食堂交火灰，社员交人粪尿，饲养员分别交牛粪、鸡鸭粪；（3）各生产队生产小组设收肥员、保肥员，并实行“人畜定量、定期交肥”制度。（宫敬之、李益芳）
    本报西宁6日电　青海省湟中县的积肥造肥运动进入抓质量、抓有机肥料的新阶段。
    不久以前，中共湟中县委对积肥造肥运动进行了检查，发现前一阶段的肥料数量增加很快，但大部分是熏土、老墙土等无机肥，有机肥只占25％。县委认为在今后的积肥运动中要更多地注意抓肥料质量。目前，各人民公社都准备大量沤制各种有机肥料；同时注意收集人畜粪尿等有机肥。
    为了使在寒冬沤制的有机肥料迅速发酵，湟中县各公社采用了各种方法加温沤肥。例如用蒸汽加温，日晒加温，土窑加温等。沤肥原料有青草、落叶、垃圾、麦秆、菜秆等。
    由于县委和各公社党委及时提出了抓肥料质量，大多数公社近来积的肥料中，有机肥已经上升到30％到40％。　（杨立本）
