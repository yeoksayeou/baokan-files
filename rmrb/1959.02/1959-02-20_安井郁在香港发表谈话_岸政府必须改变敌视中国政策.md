Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 19th: Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, told reporters in Hong Kong today that the fundamental key to improving relations between Japan and China is that the Japanese government must stop implementing its hostile policy toward China.

Yasui Kaoru said that the reason why Nobusuke Kishi is currently advocating the separation of politics and economics is because he is under pressure from the Japanese people. He said: On the one hand, the voices of people from all walks of life in Japan demanding the establishment of friendly and trade relations with China are getting louder and louder, and on the other hand, Nobusuke Kishi still wants to be closely linked with the United States. Kishi's conspiracy is to try to shift the responsibility for damaging Sino-Japanese friendly relations onto China. Yasui Kaoru pointed out that the current state of Sino-Japanese relations is the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Yasui Kaoru then said: "I have seen the great peaceful construction underway in China, and China has always based itself on a peaceful policy. China will never invade Japan under any circumstances. What China is wary of is the revival of Japanese militarism. If this vigilance is regarded as China's hostility towards Japan or China's interference in Japan's internal affairs, it would be a great mistake." Yasui Kaoru also expressed his opposition to the United States establishing a huge military base in Japan, saying: "The Japanese people do not want to be hostile to any country, and at the same time, they will never allow other countries to use Japan for their strategic purposes."

Yasui Kaoru visited China from February 7th to 18th at the invitation of the China Peace Committee, and arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou today on his way back to Japan.

    安井郁在香港发表谈话 
    岸政府必须改变敌视中国政策
    新华社香港19日电　日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天对香港的报纸记者说，日中两国关系改善的根本关键是日本政府必须停止执行敌视中国的政策。
    安井郁说，目前岸信介所以要鼓吹所谓把政治和经济分开来的论调，是因为受到了日本人民的压力。他说：一方面日本各阶层人民要求与中国建立友好、贸易关系的呼声越来越高，另一方面岸信介仍然要和美国紧密连结在一起。岸信介阴谋就是想把破坏日中友好关系的责任推卸到中国身上来。安井郁指出：目前的日中两国关系的情况是要由岸信介政府来负责的。
    安井郁接着说：“我在中国看到正在进行伟大的和平建设，中国一贯都是以和平政策作为基础，中国无论如何也不会侵略日本，中国所警惕的是日本军国主义复活，假如把这种警惕看成是中国敌视日本或者是中国干涉日本的内政，这将是绝大的错误。”安井郁还表示反对美国在日本建立庞大的军事基地，他说：“日本人民不愿敌视任何国家，同时也绝对不允许其他国家为了它的战略目的而利用日本。”
    安井郁应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的邀请，在2月7日到18日的期间访问了中国，他今天从广州到达香港转道回日本。
