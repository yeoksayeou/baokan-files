Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 21st: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 21st a statement by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) on the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

The statement said that after studying the results of the 21st Congress of the CPSU in detail, the Central Committee of the SED pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU had initiated a new period in the development of the Soviet Union, the period of comprehensively building a communist society. It pointed out the specific outlines of such a future society, in which the complete satisfaction of people and their needs will become the center of social activities. The Soviet Union is the first vanguard to strive towards this goal. The statement said that Comrade Khrushchev's assertion that all socialist countries will enter communist society roughly at the same time has brought us great encouragement. The conclusion drawn from this is that the great prospects depicted by this congress will also become our prospects in the near future.

The statement said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU, especially the resolution on the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, has opened a new stage in the development of the world socialist system. It is clear that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are at the forefront of world progress.
The socialist system is already having a decisive influence on international development.

The statement said that the results of the 21st Congress of the CPSU show that the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the SED and the resolutions of the CPSU are in complete agreement. Although the German Democratic Republic is only in the period of building socialism, we can draw many lessons and practical conclusions from the preparation and proceedings of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

The statement pointed out that the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the corresponding plans of other socialist countries will give the socialist system and other peaceful forces such a great advantage over the imperialist forces that it will be practically possible to eliminate world war from social life before socialism achieves victory worldwide. The basic issue for socialist countries in the next seven years is the issue of winning time to the maximum extent in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism.

The statement pointed out that the clear assertions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU regarding the strength and unity of the socialist camp and the balance of international forces make it clear to everyone that the German militarists' attempt to conquer the German Democratic Republic has failed completely.

Turning to the German question, the statement continued, the key issue today is to win a glorious position for the German nation among the peoples of the world. We will do our utmost to promote a peace treaty and understanding between the two Germanies. If the Bonn government continues to refuse to propose a peace treaty, then the peace treaty will be concluded without Bonn's proposal, and peace will be achieved in Germany!

The statement said that the responsibility of the German working class requires the leadership of the Social Democratic Party to adopt a clear national, anti-militarist, and peace-defending stance in this struggle.

The Central Committee of the SED emphasized that Comrade Khrushchev's report and the discussions of other comrades developed the theoretical basis for the transition from socialism to communism, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union set an outstanding example of vividly applying Marxism-Leninism.

The statement pointed out the importance of ideological work of the Party and mass organizations, saying that the socialist education of the working people, especially the socialist education of the youth, is one of our most important tasks.

The statement concluded by saying that a correct assessment of the 21st Congress of the CPSU will lead to new achievements in the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and further consolidate the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 21st: Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, delivered a report at a meeting of activists of the Sofia Municipal Party Committee on the 20th, talking about the situation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the great international significance of the Congress.

Zhivkov said that the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU was not only a major event in the life of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, but also a major event in the life of all socialist countries, all fraternal parties, and all mankind.

Zhivkov said that Comrade Khrushchev's report at this Congress was permeated with the profound realistic spirit of Leninism. With great fearlessness, it pointed out the road and specific tasks for building communism in the Soviet Union in the next seven years. It is a document of great theoretical, practical, and guiding significance for the entire world revolutionary movement, and a document that puts forward a great program for the struggle for peace and international peaceful coexistence.

Zhivkov pointed out that for all socialist countries and for countries that will embark on the path of socialism in the future, the principle put forward by Khrushchev is of great theoretical and practical significance, namely: socialist countries will enter the advanced stage of communist society roughly at the same time. This principle is also of great theoretical and practical significance for our country. It gives us new strength and new confidence, enabling us to better and more fully understand our reality and understand the tasks that are of enormous scale for our country. Of course, this proposition instructs all socialist countries, including Bulgaria, to further explore the internal potential of the socialist system, utilize these potentials without losing a day, and move forward more boldly and confidently along the socialist path.

Zhivkov further pointed out that since the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the general trend of international situation development can be seen more clearly: the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialism is growing irresistibly. Imperialism is increasingly losing its foundation. There is no doubt that the completion of the Seven-Year Plan and the overall upsurge of the socialist camp will bring about further changes in the balance of world forces and create increasingly favorable conditions for consolidating world peace.

Zhivkov emphasized that the 21st Congress of the CPSU clearly demonstrated the increasing strength and unity of the international communist movement and the workers' movement. The attempts of the imperialists and the Yugoslav revisionists to undermine the unity between the Marxist-Leninist parties have failed. He also pointed out that the struggle against revisionism is not over.

Zhivkov exposed the attempt of the Yugoslav revisionists to portray the criticisms made by the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the representatives of fraternal parties at the Congress as criticisms of the Yugoslav people. He said that we are criticizing the position and ideas of the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, criticizing their fabrications and theoretical speculations. As long as they still call themselves communists, as long as they continue to confuse the Yugoslav people and engage in splitting the international communist movement and workers' movement, and serve the interests of American imperialism in action, then we will expose these vicious revisionists, these accomplices, servants, and lackeys of imperialism. Zhivkov said that we respect the Yugoslav people, who have waged a heroic anti-fascist struggle, and our criticism of revisionism is not directed at them.

Zhivkov concluded by saying that the resolutions of the past congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have always been a guide to action for the Bulgarian communists. There is no doubt that the 21st Congress of the CPSU and its resolutions will also become our guiding documents. For this reason, the Party Central Committee believes that Khrushchev's report and the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU should be studied in depth in all study units, and every Communist Party member should widely publicize them among the Bulgarian people.

    新华社柏林21日电　“新德意志报”21日刊登了德国统一社会党中央委员会就苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会发表的声明。
    声明说，德国统一社会党中央委员会详细地研究了苏共第二十一次代表大会的结果后指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会开始了苏联发展的新时期、全面建设共产主义社会的时期。它指出了这样的未来社会的具体轮廓，在这个社会中，人和人的需要的完全满足将成为社会活动的中心。苏联就是第一个朝着这一目标努力的先锋队。声明说，赫鲁晓夫同志关于所有社会主义国家将大致同时进入共产主义社会的论断给我们带来了巨大的鼓舞。由此得出的结论是：这次代表大会所描画的伟大前景，也将在不久以后成为我们的前景。
    声明说，苏共第二十一次代表大会，首先是关于苏联七年计划的决议，给世界社会主义体系的发展揭开了一个新的阶段。很显然，苏联和其他社会主义国家是站在世界进步的最前列的。
    社会主义体系已经在对国际发展起着决定性的影响。
    声明说，苏共第二十一次代表大会的结果表明，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会决议和苏共决议之间是完全一致的。虽然德意志民主共和国刚刚处在建设社会主义的时期，但我们从苏共第二十一次代表大会的准备和会议的进行过程中却能吸取许多教益和得出实际的结论。
    声明指出，由于苏联七年计划和其他社会主义国家相应计划的完成，将使社会主义体系和其他和平力量较之帝国主义力量拥有这样大的优势：以至在社会主义在世界范围内取得胜利以前，就有实际的可能把世界战争从社会生活中排除出去。社会主义国家今后七年的基本问题是在社会主义同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中，最大限度地赢得时间的问题。
    声明指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会的关于社会主义阵营的力量和团结、关于国际力量对比的鲜明论断，使每一个人都清楚地认识到：德国军国主义者企图征服德意志民主共和国的全盘计划是永远地破产了。
    在谈到德国问题时，声明接着指出，今天的关键问题就是要给德国民族在世界各国人民中赢得一个光荣的位置。我们将全力促成和约和两个德国的谅解。如果波恩政府仍然拒绝提出和约的建议，那么在没有波恩的建议之下，和约也将会缔结，和平也将在德国获得胜利！
    声明说，德国工人阶级的责任，要求社会民主党领导机构在这一斗争中采取鲜明的民族、反军国主义、以保卫和平为目的的立场。
    德国统一社会党中央着重指出，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和其他同志的讨论发言发展了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的理论基础，苏联共产党树立了活生生的运用马克思列宁主义的卓越榜样。
    声明在谈到党和群众组织的思想工作的重要意义时指出，劳动人民的社会主义教育、首先是青年的社会主义教育，是我们的一项最重要的任务。
    声明最后说，对于苏共第二十一次代表大会的正确估计，将导致德意志民主共和国社会主义建设新成就的出现，和进一步巩固德苏两国人民的友谊。
    新华社索非亚21日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫20日在索非亚市党组织积极分子会议上做了报告，谈到了苏共第二十一次代表大会的情况和大会的巨大的国际意义。
    日夫科夫说，苏共第二十一次非常代表大会不仅是苏联共产党和苏联人民生活中的一件大事，而且也是所有社会主义国家、所有兄弟党和全人类生活中的一件大事。
    日夫科夫说，赫鲁晓夫同志在这次大会上所作的报告，渗透着列宁主义的深刻的现实主义精神，它以大无畏的精神指出了今后七年在苏联建设共产主义的道路和具体任务，它是一个对整个世界革命运动具有重大的理论、实际和指导意义的文件，是一个提出了为和平和国际和平共处进行斗争的伟大纲领的文件。
    日夫科夫指出，对所有社会主义国家和对将来会走上社会主义道路的国家来说，赫鲁晓夫提出的这样一个原理具有重大的理论意义和实际意义，这个原理就是：社会主义国家将大致同时地进入共产主义社会的高级阶段。这个原理对我国也有重大的理论意义和实际意义。它给了我们以新的力量和新的信心，使我们可以更好、更全面地理解我们的现实和理解对我国来说规模是巨大的任务。当然，这种提法责成所有社会主义国家，其中包括保加利亚，更加深入去发掘社会主义制度内部的潜力，一天也不损失地动用这些潜力，更加大胆和更加有信心地沿着社会主义道路前进。
    日夫科夫又指出，自苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，可以更明确地看出国际局势发展的总的趋向：苏联和整个社会主义的力量正在不可遏止地增长。帝国主义越来越丧失自己的基础。毫无疑问，七年计划的完成和社会主义阵营的总的高涨，将使世界力量的对比发生进一步的变化，将能为巩固世界和平创造越来越有利的条件。
    日夫科夫强调说，苏共第二十一次代表大会鲜明地表明了国际共产主义运动和工人运动的力量和团结的日益加强。帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者想要破坏马克思列宁主义政党之间的团结的企图破产了。他又指出，但是反对修正主义的斗争没有结束。
    日夫科夫揭露南斯拉夫修正主义者企图把苏共第二十一次代表大会和兄弟党代表在会上提出的批评，说成是对南斯拉夫人民的批评。他说，我们是在批评南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团的立场和观念，批评他们的捏造和理论上的投机。只要他们还自称为共产党人，只要他们还继续迷惑南斯拉夫人民和进行分裂国际共产主义运动和工人运动的勾当，并在行动中为美国帝国主义的利益服务，那么，我们就要揭露他们这些恶毒的修正主义者，这些帝国主义者的帮凶、奴仆、走狗。日夫科夫说，我们尊重南斯拉夫人民，他们曾经进行过英勇的反法西斯斗争，我们对修正主义的批评并不是针对他们。
    日夫科夫最后说，苏联共产党历次代表大会的决议一直是保加利亚共产党人的行动指南。毫无疑问，苏共第二十一次代表大会和它的决议也将成为我们的指导性文件。正因为如此，党中央认为赫鲁晓夫的报告和苏共第二十一大的决议应该在所有的学习单位中加以深入的研究，每个共产党员都应该在保加利亚人民中广泛地加以宣传。
