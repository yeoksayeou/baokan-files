Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant has mobilized the masses to launch a high-yield week campaign focused on increasing the production of high-quality metallurgical coke, ensuring that the "Marshal of Steel" eats well and is well-fed. Starting in late January, high-yield week campaigns have followed one after another, pushing production levels to new heights. According to statistics, in January, the output of metallurgical coke reached 101.9% of the plan; in the first half of February, it reached 102.7% of the plan; the quality of metallurgical coke also steadily increased, with the average coke strength in early February increasing by 2.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

During the high-yield week campaign, the morale of the workers became increasingly strong. The coking workers of four shifts in the Second Coking Workshop launched a competition. The Ding shift took the lead, solving the key problem of smoke from the furnace doors before starting work. They carefully cleaned and repaired the furnace doors, sealing the gaps that were causing the smoke. The Yi shift workers, seeing this, also actively participated in the repair work ahead of time, ensuring the smooth flow of coking gas. The Bing shift workers were not to be outdone, likewise clearing away the accumulated powdered coke in the powdered coke pool ahead of time to prevent it from overflowing and affecting production. In this way, the workers of the four shifts raced to solve the key problems in production, significantly improving the production situation of the entire workshop. The coal preparation workshop organized cadres and workers to rush to unload coal. In the second high-yield week campaign, a total of 3,505 train cars of coal were unloaded in six days, an average of 584 cars per day.

After each high-yield week campaign, the workshops mobilized the masses for great airing of views, great debates, and summing up of campaign experiences. They launched great evaluations and comparisons to encourage the advanced and put forward new goals, arranging the next high-yield week campaign.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th: The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, whose paper production accounts for one-quarter of the total paper production in Tianjin, carried out a production competition centered on technological revolution. In the first half of February, they overfulfilled the production plan, increasing the production of paper by 97 tons and paper pulp by 297 tons.

In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, this factory vigorously solved the problem of raw materials. The workers launched a competition centered on technological revolution to save raw materials. In the competition, the workers created many advanced methods for saving raw materials. Li Chengxi, an old worker on No. 13 machine in the Second Workshop, improved his operating techniques in order to save wood pulp, using only reed pulp to produce glazed paper. After testing, the quality met the requirements, and it is now being produced in large quantities, which can save more than 600 tons of wood pulp annually. The workers on No. 3 machine quickly learned this experience, reducing the proportion of wood pulp in embossed printing paper from 15% to 5%, which can save more than 1,200 tons of wood pulp by the end of the year. The workers also built two fluidized bed furnaces themselves using waste materials to re-smelt the slag used in mechanical roasting pots (containing 10% sulfur), which can save three tons of pyrite per day, ensuring the normal production of paper.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 20th: Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the workers of the Dalian Chemical Plant have been consistently full of energy, and the production upsurge has been higher than the last. Although production conditions were difficult in January this year, and the cold weather was unfavorable to chemical production, and also affected transportation, the average daily output of major products such as soda ash, synthetic ammonia, lump coke, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and ammonium sulfate since January still exceeded the level of December last year.

The excellent work style of the cadres and workers of this factory since the Great Leap Forward last year has continued to be carried forward this year, and some have become regular systems. The factory party committee secretary, factory director, trade union chairman, and leading cadres of various workshops have maintained the spirit of hard work from last year, and still take turns on duty every night to deal with various problems in a timely manner. Leading cadres, technicians, and staff at the factory level and in various workshops take turns participating in one day of labor per week, which has become a regular system. Currently, an average of 237 cadres participate in labor every day. The enthusiastic propaganda and mobilization work during the hard work period last year has also been maintained until now. The workshops still feature gongs and drums, express reports, big-character posters, red flags, and broadcasts of new people and new things, which are still very lively. (Attached picture)

The coking workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant increased the amount of coal loaded while ensuring that the gas was unobstructed, without fire, smoke, or blockage, so that the coking time was reduced to an average of thirteen hours (designed for fifteen hours), and the quality of the coke also met the specified requirements.

    首季生产抓当前
    二月日日要高产
    鞍钢化工总厂上半月超额完成计划
    天津造纸总厂十五天增产九十吨纸
    大连化工厂日产量超过去年的水平
    据新华社鞍山20日电　鞍钢化工总厂发动群众展开以增产优质冶金焦炭为内容的高产周运动，保证钢铁元帅吃得饱、吃得好。从1月下旬开始，高产周运动一个接着一个，把生产水平推向新的高峰。据统计，1月份冶金焦炭的产量完成计划101.9％；2月份上半月完成计划102.7％；冶金焦炭的质量也稳步上升，2月上旬的平均焦炭强度比去年第四季度提高2.3％。
    在高产周运动中，职工们的情绪越来越旺盛。第二炼焦车间四个班的炼焦工人展开竞赛，丁班工人一马当先，在上班前就首先解决炉门冒烟的关键问题。他们认真清扫和修理炉门，堵死了炉门冒烟的空缝。乙班工人看了，也积极地提前参加修理活动，让炼焦炉煤气畅通，丙班工人不甘示弱，同样地提前掏挖好粉焦池堆积的粉焦，以免粉焦外溢，影响生产。这样，四个班的工人争先恐后解决了生产中的关键问题，使全车间的生产情况显著好转。配煤车间组织干部和工人抢卸煤炭。在第二次高产周战役中，六天共卸煤三千五百零五车，平均每天卸车高达五百八十四车。
    各车间在每次高产周战役结束后，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，总结战役经验，展开大评大比，激励先进，并且提出新的奋斗目标，布置下一次高产周战役。
    据新华社天津20日电　纸张产量占天津市纸张总产量四分之一的国营天津造纸总厂的职工们，开展以技术革命为中心的生产竞赛，2月上半月超额完成了生产计划，增产了九十七吨纸张和二百九十七吨纸浆。
    这个厂为了满足生产大跃进的需要，大力地解决原材料问题。职工们发起以技术革命为中心的竞赛，节约原材料。职工们在竞赛中，创造了很多节约原材料的先进方法。第二车间十三号机的老工人李承喜，为了节约木浆，改进操作技术，全部使用苇浆制出有光纸，经过试验，质量合乎要求，现已大量生产，全年可以节约木浆六百多吨。三号机工人们很快学习这个经验，将凸板印刷纸的木浆配比由15％降低到5％，到年底可以节约木浆一千二百多吨。职工们还自己动手利用废料建立起两座沸腾炉，回炼机械焙烧锅用过的矿渣（其中含硫10％），一天可以节约硫铁矿三吨，保证了纸张的正常生产。
    据新华社旅大20日电　大连化工厂自从去年大跃进以来，职工干劲始终饱满，生产热潮一浪高过一浪。今年1月份，生产条件虽然困难，天寒地冻对化工生产不利，也影响到运输，但是纯碱、合成氨、块焦、硫酸、硝酸、硫铵等主要产品，1月份以来的平均日产量仍然超过了去年12月份的水平。
    这个厂的干部和职工去年大跃进以来的优良作风，今年继续得到了发扬，有的已成为经常的制度。工厂党委书记、厂长、工会主席和各车间的领导干部，保持了去年的苦战精神，每晚仍然轮流值班，及时处理各项问题。厂一级和各车间的领导干部、技术人员、职员，每周轮流参加一天劳动，这已经成为经常制度，现在平均每天参加劳动的干部有二百三十七名。去年苦战期间那样热火朝天的宣传鼓动工作，也一直保持到现在。车间里面敲锣打鼓跟班送喜报，大字报，红旗，以及广播新人新事等，仍然热闹非凡。（附图片）
    鞍钢化工总厂炼焦工人在保证煤气畅通，不冒火，不冒烟，不堵塞的条件下增多装煤量，使结焦时间平均缩短到十三小时（设计为十五小时），焦炭的质量也达到了规定的要求。
