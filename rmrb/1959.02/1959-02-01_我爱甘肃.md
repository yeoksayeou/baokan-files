    I Love Gansu
    Ji Yunxia
    I voluntarily signed up to participate in the construction of Gansu. I left Shanghai on December 25, 1956, and arrived in Lanzhou.

    It's a joke now to talk about it. Before I left, I heard people say that the Northwest was very cold, the climate was extremely dry, there was no rice or vegetables, and people lived in cave dwellings. They also said that you couldn't buy any daily necessities, and life was really difficult! Whether you believe it or not, that's what people said. Believing it or not, no one had actually seen it. I thought to myself, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, what place can't I go to!

    At that time, I was only eighteen years old and traveling far from home for the first time. My mother was afraid that I would suffer, so she prepared eight pairs of shoes, eight pairs of socks, five bars of soap, three tubes of toothpaste, three toothbrushes, four towels, a thermos, an umbrella, clothes hooks, bedsheets, buttons, pastries, melon seeds, bowls, chopsticks... My mother wiped away tears and said, "When you run out, I'll send you more." The classmates who saw me off also gave me toothpaste, soap, and many other daily necessities.

    What exactly is Gansu like! It was a mystery in my heart. The train was running, and the scenery of southern China gradually faded into the distance. Three days later, we arrived in Lanzhou. We stayed in a three-story hotel, which had electric lights and running water. In front of the hotel was a large road; trucks loaded with cement, steel, and various machines, and horse-drawn carts loaded with cabbage, spinach, radishes, and the specialties of Lanzhou - cauliflower, lily bulbs, and winter pears - came and went in an endless stream. At night, looking into the distance, the electric lights were as dense as stars, and the open spaces were filled with dense scaffolding. At this time, thinking about what I had heard in the past, I found it particularly ridiculous!

    I was assigned to work in a department store, worked as a salesperson for a period, and now I am a salesperson for the Yongchang Road Department Store in Lanzhou. When I started working, it was difficult to find locally produced daily necessities in the store's counters. The few that existed were placed in inconspicuous corners. What I saw were mostly goods from other provinces. The salespeople wanted to introduce more local new products to customers, but at that time, there were too few varieties of local products. Many daily necessities could not yet be manufactured in Gansu. In the past two years, Gansu's light industry has developed greatly. Many daily necessities that used to rely on Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places for supply can now be manufactured locally. The local products in the store's counters are increasing day by day. The quality of some products has already caught up with Shanghai products, such as enamelware and Dunhuang brand ink. Some products have reached the level of export, such as woolen blankets and various woolen fabrics. Other products, such as rubber shoes, thermos bottles, soap, milk powder, and colorful glassware, total several hundred kinds. More and more customers are choosing to buy local products.

    In April of last year, I was reassigned to be a salesperson. Since then, I have often visited the new industrial areas, delivering various daily necessities to the construction sites. Every time I go to the Qilihe Mechanical Industrial Zone and the Xigu Chemical Industrial Zone in western Lanzhou, I see different changes. A wilderness from a month ago has, because of the adoption of rapid construction methods, had huge factory buildings erected in a month. The changes every day are great. When I deliver daily necessities to the workers, I feel happy, because I have also contributed to the construction of Lanzhou!

    I have met many workers in these new factories, many of whom also came from coastal areas. I love these brand-new factories, and I also love the people who built them with their own hands. I like to talk with them more. My main task is to sell goods in bulk, but when I meet these lovely builders, I always ask them what they need. Even if it is a pair of shoes or a toothbrush, I am happy to deliver the goods to them from dozens of miles away.

    In September of last year, in order to exchange experiences in selling goods, I had the opportunity to go to the Yumen Oilfield. I was very familiar with this name when I was in school, and now I have seen it with my own eyes. The Yumen Oilfield is an oil city in the Gobi Desert. On both sides of the wide asphalt roads here, neat trees are planted. The city has theaters, hospitals, banks, teahouses, bookstores, and department stores, everything you could want. I walked out of the Jiayuguan Pass and through the vast Gobi Desert. What I saw was no longer the desolation described by ancient poets, but construction scenes everywhere.

    On the way to the Yumen Oilfield, along the newly built Lanxin Railway, I also saw the huge iron and steel joint enterprise and the sugar and wine joint enterprise under construction. Several new industrial cities are growing.

    I have been in Gansu for more than two years, and I hear exciting news every day. The "Mountain Canal" has started construction, and tens of thousands of people have entered the Qilian Mountains. The Hero Canal in Yongjing has been completed. The thermal power plant has generated electricity. The Lanxin Railway has left Gansu Province. The grain harvest is abundant. Steel production has been a great success. The diversion tunnel of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station has been opened. Another bridge over the Yellow River has opened to traffic. Primary school education has been universalized... Construction victories come one after another. I have fallen in love with Gansu, and I have fallen in love with this place where all kinds of construction are making great leaps forward. To be honest, I used to want to go back to the South, but now, I have settled down here. I have married a comrade who grew up in the Northwest and established a new family. Gansu has become my hometown. I often write letters to my family, telling them everything I have seen and my happiness. My mother wrote to me, congratulating us on the establishment of our new family, and telling us to work hard together. She is also planning to come to Gansu to see us.

    我爱甘肃
    纪蕴霞
    我是自动报名到甘肃参加建设的，在1956年12月25日离开上海，到了兰州。
    现在说起来是个笑话。动身以前，听人家说，西北很冷，气候非常干燥，没有大米和蔬菜，住的是窑洞。还说，什么生活用品都买不到，生活真难啊！不信吧，人家说的和真的一样。信吧，也没有谁看见。心想，我是个共青团员，什么地方不能去呢！
    那时，我才十八岁，第一次出远门。我母亲怕我受苦，给我准备了八双鞋子、八双袜子、五条肥皂、三支牙膏、三支牙刷、四条毛巾，还有热水瓶、雨伞、挂衣服的钩子、床单、钮扣、糕点、瓜子、碗、筷……。母亲擦着泪说：“用完了，再给你寄去。”送行的同学们，又送给我牙膏、肥皂等许多日用品。
    甘肃究竟是个什么样子！在我心里是个谜。火车在奔跑，江南风光渐渐退到远方去了。三天以后，到了兰州。我们住在一座三层楼的旅馆里，里边有电灯有自来水。旅馆前面是大马路；装着水泥、钢材和各种机器的汽车，装着大白菜、菠菜、萝卜和兰州特产的菜花、百合、冬果梨的马车，往来不绝。夜里，向远方看，电灯像繁星一样密，空旷的场地都已树起密密的脚手架。这时，想想过去听到的事，觉得特别可笑了！
    我被分配在百货商店工作，当过一个时期的营业员，现在我是兰州市永昌路百货商店的推销员。开始工作时，在商店货柜中很难找到本地生产的日用百货，仅有的几样也被放在不显著的角落里，所看到的大都是外省来的货物，营业员们很想给顾客多介绍些本地新产品，但是，当时本地产品的花色品种太少，许多生活用品，甘肃还不能制造。两年多来，甘肃轻工业有很大发展，许多过去依靠上海、天津等地供应的日用百货，现在都能自己制造了，商店货柜中的本地产品一天天在增加，有些产品的质量已经赶上了上海产品，如搪瓷用品、敦煌牌墨水。有的产品达到了出口水平，像毛毯和各色呢料。其它如胶鞋、热水瓶、香皂、乳粉、五彩玻璃器皿等等，共有好几百种，顾客们选购本地产品的已愈来愈多。
    去年4月，我改任推销员工作。从此以后我就经常出入在新兴工业区，把各种生活用品送到工地。我每次到兰州西面的七里河机械工业区和西固化工区去，每次都可看到不同的变化，一个月以前的旷野，因为采用快速施工方法，一个月后已建立起巨大的厂房，每一天的变化都是很大的。当我把日用品送到工人手里的时候，心里高兴，因为在建设兰州的时候，我也出了力了！
    我在这些新建工厂里已经认识了好多职工，他们中不少也是从沿海地区来的，我爱这些崭新的工厂，也爱亲手建设工厂的人，我喜欢同他们多谈谈。我的主要任务是成批地推销商品，但是当我碰到这些可爱的建设者们，总要问他们需要些什么，即使是一双鞋、一把牙刷，我也乐意从数十里外把东西送到他们手里。
    去年9月，为了交流推销商品的经验，我有机会到玉门油矿去。这个名字在学校念书时就很熟悉，现在亲眼看到了。玉门油矿是戈壁滩上的石油城，这里宽阔的柏油马路两旁，种植了整齐的树木，市区里戏院、医院、银行、茶馆、书店、百货商店，应有尽有。我走出嘉峪关，穿过辽阔的戈壁滩，看到的不再是古诗人形容的荒凉了，而是到处建设的景象。
    在到玉门油矿的途中，沿着新建的兰新铁路，我还看到正在建设的巨大的钢铁联合企业、糖酒联合企业，好几个新工业城在成长。
    我到甘肃已二年多了，每天都听到令人兴奋的消息。“山上运河”开工了，成千上万的人进入祁连山了，永靖的英雄渠修好了，热电站发电了，兰新铁路出了甘肃境了，粮食丰收了，大炼钢铁胜利了，刘家峡水电站的导流隧洞打通了，黄河上又一座桥通车了，小学教育普及了……。建设的胜利一个接一个。我爱上了甘肃，爱上了这块各项建设都在大跃进的地方。说实在的，过去我还想回到南方去，可是现在，我在这里安家落户了。我已和一位生长在西北的同志结了婚，建立了新家庭。甘肃，已经成为我的家乡。我时常把我看到的一切，把我的快乐，写信告诉家里。我的母亲给我来信，祝贺我们新家庭的建立，叫我们共同努力工作，她老人家还准备到甘肃来看看呢。
