Scientific Field Management Methods
    ——Introducing the Wheat File Management System in Wushan County, Gansu
    By our reporters Zhang Ming and Wang Tiqiang
    The wheat file management system is a scientific method for managing wheat fields. It is a further improvement upon the field management responsibility system. This management system requires dividing wheat fields into categories, registering them with numbers, noting indicators, measures, and operating procedures, specifying the allocation of management personnel, and recording the actual operating conditions on the file form at all times for inspection and acceptance. With this field management method, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture can be effectively implemented, and large-scale high-yield wheat production will have a reliable guarantee.

    The Genesis of the Wheat File System

    Last autumn, Wushan County planted a total of 500,000 mu of winter wheat, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to the actual yield of last year. In the mountainous and arid Wushan County, to achieve this production increase target, one must sweat profusely and implement embroidery-like cultivation methods from planting to harvesting. Before the county's wheat entered the "management" phase of the "Eight-Character Charter," it had already laid a good foundation. Generally, wheat fields were deeply ploughed to more than 1.2 chi, and the average base fertilizer application was 30,000 to 50,000 jin per mu. Once the "management" phase began, the wave of implementing the wheat file management system quickly spread throughout the county and achieved remarkable results. In the past, less than 50% of wheat fields were top-dressed, with only 3,000 to 5,000 jin of top-dressing fertilizer applied per mu. This year, over 90% of the wheat fields have been top-dressed, with first-grade fields receiving 20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu, second-grade fields 20,000 jin, and third-grade fields 8,000 jin. Some wheat fields have already been top-dressed two or three times. Wheat fields with irrigation conditions have all undergone one or two winter irrigations. Even wheat fields without irrigation conditions have actively mobilized the masses to carry ice and collect snow to conserve water and soil moisture. After this period of meticulous field management, the wheat seedlings in all grades of wheat fields throughout the county are growing well with complete tillering. First-grade fields have reached over one million plants per mu, second-grade fields over 800,000 plants, and third-grade fields around 500,000 plants. Based on this situation, it is estimated that the county's target of an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu of winter wheat is achievable and can be exceeded.

    When planting wheat last year, the Wushan County Party Committee felt that the 1959 production increase task was significant. If the measures did not keep up, there was a risk of failure. Therefore, it was decided to strengthen the wheat field management responsibility system. In August, the County Party Committee work team went to the Wenjia Temple Production Team of Luomen Commune to experiment with establishing a new management system. They thought, "Cadres have file materials, why can't wheat have them too? If managing wheat is as meticulous as doing people's work, why fear not managing it well?" At the same time, the high-yield fields of the previous year had detailed operation records. Picking up these good methods and systematizing them would create the wheat file management system. With this system, wheat field management could be carried out meticulously and systematically according to the original production plan and various technical measures. Subsequently, they convened a symposium of experienced farmers, investigated the local soil, climate, and crop growth conditions over the years, and then formulated the file volume. The work team and commune cadres personally managed a 117-mu wheat field. A wooden sign was inserted at the head of the field, indicating the production target and measures, the cultivator (manager), the guide, and the inspector. The file volume for this wheat field was also placed in the production team's archives. Each time a measure was implemented, it was promptly entered into the file volume. Seeing that this method was effective for wheat field management, the masses agreed to promote it. Soon, the wheat file management system was quickly promoted to various production teams in the commune. After establishing the file management system, the 2,000 mu of winter wheat in the Wenjia Temple Production Team ensured the implementation of the original various measures one by one. For example, the original plan for the first-grade wheat field was to irrigate seven times and fertilize eight times. Before the Spring Festival, it had already been irrigated twice and fertilized three times. The dates and details of these works were all recorded in the file volume.

    During the promotion of the wheat file management system in Luomen Commune, the Commune established a File Management Bureau with the Party Committee as its core, the Management District established a File Management Committee, and the Production Team established an Archives. Relying on technical cadres, experienced farmers, and meteorologists, the more than 80,000 mu of winter wheat in the entire commune were divided into three grades according to soil, water conservancy, climate, contiguous land, and cultivation level. Each grade was assigned different production increase targets and measures. To facilitate leadership, it was also divided into four routes and eight directions according to natural areas. The Party Committee took responsibility for the routes, the General Branch took responsibility for the directions, the Branch took responsibility for the pieces, and the team took responsibility for the blocks, and individuals took responsibility for each mu. Ensuring that every route had a commander, every direction had a general, and every block had a soldier.

    Systematizing Experience

    Following closely, the Wushan County Party Committee adopted various methods to launch a high tide of establishing the wheat file management system throughout the county. This newly emerging field management method, after being widely used and continuously improved by various communes throughout the county, has become increasingly perfect. For example, some wheat field managers have compiled catchy rhymes based on the tasks and requirements of different periods: "Before fertilizing, first test, calculate according to the ratio; organic fertilizer works slowly, apply it all in advance; top-dressing relies on soil fertilizer, use grass ash to prevent lodging; timely and appropriate amounts, always remember, fertilize before irrigation is more important; nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers are all complete, strive to apply 300,000 (jin) per mu." These rhymes are recorded in handbooks to make advanced management methods more convenient to circulate among the masses. The wheat file management system did not initially include meteorology, but later it was felt that meteorological data was essential to prevent natural disasters such as wind, frost, freezing, hail, etc. Therefore, various localities added the meteorology item to the file management system in practice.

    To make the wheat file management system more systematic and organized, the Wushan County Party Committee specially formulated the "Thirty Articles of Wheat File Management Methods." The main content includes:

    1. Divide the county's 500,000 mu of winter wheat into three grades based on natural conditions. First-grade wheat fields average 1,600 jin per mu, requiring eight irrigations, 200,000 jin of standard fertilizer per mu, and deep plowing to more than 1.5 chi; all superior varieties should be selected, with a seeding rate of more than 45 jin per mu; achieving a land as flat as a mirror, soil as fine as flour, full germination and strong seedlings, eradication of diseases and pests, no weeds, and no lodging; and having facilities for preventing wind, frost, freezing, hail, and bird and animal damage. Second-grade fields average 800 jin per mu, requiring five waterings, 100,000 jin of standard fertilizer per mu, deep plowing to more than 1.2 chi, a seeding rate of 35 jin per mu, and more than 80% of superior varieties, ensuring no diseases or pests. Third-grade fields average 200 jin per mu, requiring sufficient water and moisture, 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, deep plowing to 8 cun to 1 chi, and a seeding rate of 25 jin per mu, also ensuring no diseases or pests. The wheat management process is generally divided into four periods: seedling management, overwintering management, spring management, and later management. Different measures should be taken in each management stage.

    2. Each production team can set up a management station, and each management station can set up a section, with three to five managers per section, managing about 50 mu of wheat fields. Files are filled in on a section basis.

    3. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over wheat file management. Management personnel at each management station must abide by the discipline of wheat field management. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, labor competitions should be carried out between stations, sections, and individuals, with inspections every ten days, evaluations every month, summaries every season, and rewards every year.

    科学的田间管理方法
    ——介绍甘肃武山县小麦档案管理制
    本报记者　张鸣　王体强
    小麦档案管理制，是一种科学的小麦田间管理方法。它是田间管理责任制的进一步提高。这种管理制要求把麦田分成类，编号注册，注明指标、措施和操作程序，说明管理人员的配备，并把实际操作的情况随时填在档案表上，以便检查和验收。有了这种田间管理方法，便可以切实贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，小麦大面积的高额丰产也就有了可靠的保证。
    小麦档案制的产生
    武山县去秋共播种五十万亩冬小麦，平均亩产要达到一千斤，比去年实产提高一倍半。在多山而干旱的武山县来说，要实现它这个增产指标，就必须狠狠地流出几把汗，必须从种到收贯彻执行绣花般的耕作方法。全县小麦还未进入“八字宪法”中的“管”字之前，就已经奠定了一个良好的基础，一般麦田深耕达一尺二寸以上，每亩施底肥平均是三万至五万斤。“管”字一开始，实施小麦档案管理制的浪潮便迅速传到全县，并收到了显著的效果。过去麦田施追肥的不到50％，每亩不过施追肥三、五千斤，而今年已有90％以上的麦田施了追肥，其中一级田施追肥每亩为二万至三万斤，二级田二万斤，三级田八千斤，有些麦田已经追肥两三次。有灌溉条件的麦田，已全部进行了一、二次冬灌。就是没有灌溉条件的麦田，也积极发动群众背冰积雪，保水保墒。经过这个时期的细致的田间管理，全县各级麦田的麦苗都生长良好，分蘖齐全，一级田每亩已达到一百万株以上，二级田达到八十万株以上，三级田达到五十万株左右。根据这种情形推算，全县冬小麦平均亩产千斤的指标，是有把握完成并争取超过的。
    去年播种小麦的时候，中共武山县委感到1959年增产任务很大，如果措施赶不上，就有落空的危险，于是决定加强小麦田间管理责任制。8月间，县委工作组到了洛门公社文家寺生产队试验建立新管理制度。他们想，干部有档案材料，为什么小麦不可以有呢？如果管理小麦像作人的工作那样细致，还怕管不好吗？同时去年的丰产田都有详细的操作记录，把这些好办法拾起来，加以系统化，那就是小麦档案管理制。有了这种制度，便可以根据原定的生产计划和各种技术措施，细致地有条不紊地进行小麦田间管理。接着他们便召开老农座谈会，调查该地的土壤、气候和农作物历年生长情况，然后制定档案卷。工作组和社干部还亲自管理了一块一百一十七亩的麦田。在地头上插上一个木牌，注明生产指标和措施、培养人（管理人）、指导人和验收人。在生产队档案室里还摆着这块麦地的档案卷。每实施一项措施，就及时填入档案卷里。群众看到这样作对麦田管理效果好，都赞成推广。不久小麦档案管理制便迅速推行到公社的各个生产队。文家寺生产队的二千亩冬小麦，在建立起档案管理制以后，保证了原订各种措施的逐一实现。例如一级麦田原计划灌七次水，施八次肥。到春节前，已经灌水二次，施肥三次。这些工作进行的日期和情况都一一登记在档案卷上。
    洛门公社推广小麦档案管理制当中，公社以党委为核心，成立了档案管理局，管理区成立了档案管理委员会，生产队成立了档案室。依靠技术干部、老农、气象员等将全公社八万多亩冬小麦，按土壤、水利、气候、土地连片、耕作水平等情况，划分为三级田，每级都确定不同的增产指标和措施。为了便于领导，又按自然区域，分为四路八方。党委包路，总支包方，分支包片，小组包块，个人包亩。做到路路有帅，方方有将，块块有兵。
    经验系统化
    紧跟着武山县委就采取多种多样的办法在全县掀起建立小麦档案管理制的高潮。这种新生的田间管理办法，经过全县各个公社的广泛运用和不断的改进，就日益趋于完善。例如，有些地方的麦田管理员还根据不同时期的任务和要求，编成顺口溜为：“施肥以前先化验，按照比例来计算；有机肥料效果慢，提前把它都施完；追肥要靠土化肥，防止倒伏草木灰；适时适量常记牢，灌前施肥更重要；氮磷钾肥样样全，力争亩施三十万（斤）”，记在手册上，可以使先进管理方法更为方便地在群众中流传开来。小麦档案管理制最初不包括气象在内，后来感到要防止风、冻、雹等自然灾害，没有气象资料是不行的。于是各地在实践中又把气象一项加进档案管理制中去。
    为使小麦档案管理制更加系统化条理化，中共武山县委特制定了“小麦档案管理办法”三十条，最主要的内容有这几点：
    一、把全县五十万亩冬小麦依据自然条件分成三级。一级麦田平均亩产一千六百斤，要求灌溉八次水，每亩施标准肥二十万斤，深翻地在一尺半以上；全部选用优良品种，每亩下籽量四十五斤以上；达到地平如镜，土碎如面，芽全苗壮，根绝病虫害，无杂草，无倒伏；要有防风、霜、冻、雹等灾害和鸟兽害的设备。二级田每亩平均产八百斤，要求达到五水，每亩施标准肥十万斤，深翻地在一尺二寸以上，每亩下籽量三十五斤，80％以上是优良品种，保证无病无虫。三级田平均亩产是二百斤，要求做到水足墒饱，每亩施肥五万斤，深翻达八寸到一尺左右，每亩下籽量二十五斤，也要做到无病无虫。小麦管理的程序一般分为四期，即苗期管理、越冬管理、春季管理和后期管理。在每个管理阶段要采取不同的措施。
    二、每个生产队下可设管理站，管理站下设方，每方有三至五个管理员，共管理五十亩左右的麦田。档案以方为单位填写。
    三、各级党委必须加强对小麦档案管理工作的领导。各管理站的管理人员必须要遵守麦田管理的纪律。在党委的领导下，站与站、方与方、个人与个人之间应开展劳动竞赛，做到旬检查、月评比、季总结、年奖励。（附图片）
