This is What It Means to Eradicate the Roots of Poverty
　　　　Zhang Xiaoyun
Huang Ronghui's family in Luoyang Commune, Yulin, Guangxi, has a total of ten people. Only he and his eldest son are considered the main labor force. His wife, because of having many children and frequent illnesses, is only worth half a labor force. With many people and few laborers, the family had many difficulties in life. When the advanced cooperative was established in 1956, he actively participated in work after joining the cooperative, completing 400 work points in a month. At the end of the year, after settling accounts for profit distribution, the three of them earned a total of 240 yuan, which improved their lives considerably, but they were still not well-off. In 1958, with his wife and children falling ill, he borrowed some money, and by the time the commune was established, he already owed the cooperative 120 yuan.

Due to the difficulties in life, he was enthusiastic about taking the socialist road. Last year, when he heard about the establishment of people's communes, he was both happy and doubtful. He was happy because production and life might be better, but he doubted whether the commune could solve his problems, since the advanced cooperative could not. He joined the commune with a skeptical attitude. Later, the commune announced that meals were free, which was like a timely rain after a long drought for him. The heavy burden of life that had been on his shoulders for many years was lifted, and from then on, he no longer had to worry about the family's meals. After the knot in his heart was untied, he worked even more actively.

Now his family earns a total of 25 yuan in wages per month. Since meals are free in the commune, the family made new clothes for the four children, and the women are reluctant to spend their wages, planning to save them for buying small items during the Spring Festival.

The commune is very concerned about his family. Once, a work area cadre asked him if he had any difficulties in repaying the debt, and the commune could provide subsidies. But he said, "We can't ask the public to repay the debts we owe. We will repay them slowly and surely pay them off. There are no difficulties."

Now Huang Ronghui's family is living a very happy life. Huang Ronghui spreads the word everywhere that the people's commune is good. At a commune members' meeting, he also gave everyone an account: besides free meals and other commune benefits, the family's income has also increased much more than in the advanced cooperative.

    这才算挖掉了穷根
    张筱蕴
    广西玉林洛阳公社社员黄荣辉家共十口人，只有他和大儿子两个算是主要劳动力，老婆因为孩子多，又经常有病，只抵得上半个劳动力。人多劳动力少，一家人生活有很多困难。1956年成立高级社时，他入社后，干活很积极，一个月就做了四百分。年终分红一结账，三人劳动共得二百四十元，生活有了不少改善，但仍不富足。1958年，加上老婆、孩子病了，又借了些钱，到公社成立前，已欠了社里一百二十元的债。
    由于生活困难，他走社会主义道路是积极的。去年听说要成立人民公社，他又是欢喜、又是怀疑，喜的是这下生产和生活都可能更好一些，怀疑的是，高级社不能解决自己的问题，公社能不能解决呢？他就抱着半信半疑的态度参加了公社。后来公社宣布了吃饭不要钱，这对他来说，就像久旱的天忽然降下了甘露，多年来压在肩上的生活重担放下了，从此，再也不用担心一家人的吃饭问题了。心里的疙瘩解开后，工作起来就更积极了。
    现在他每月全家共收入工资二十五元，公社吃饭不要钱，家里便给四个小孩做了新衣，妇女们的工资还没有舍得花，准备留着春节时买些零碎东西。
    社里很关心他家，有次工区干部问他还债有什么困难，公社可以补助。他却说：“我们欠的债，不能叫公家还，我们慢慢还，一定还得清，没有什么困难。”
    现在黄荣辉一家生活很幸福。黄荣辉到处宣传人民公社好。在一次社员大会上，他还向大家算了一笔账：除了吃饭不要钱和公社其他福利之外，一家收入比高级社收入也增加得多了。
