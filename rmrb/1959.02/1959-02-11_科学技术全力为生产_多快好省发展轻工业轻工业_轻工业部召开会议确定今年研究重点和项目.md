Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch: The Ministry of Light Industry recently convened a National Light Industry Science and Technology Work Conference in Shanghai. In accordance with the spirit of the National Local Science and Technology Work Conference and the current requirements for further developing light industry, the meeting discussed and arranged the 1959 light industry science and technology work plan, and broadly exchanged experiences.

    Deng Jie, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry, spoke at the meeting. He said: At present, the focus of light industry science and technology research is: 1. Researching various raw materials to make the most of everything; 2. Researching how to improve the mechanization of existing equipment and increase production, and strengthening the research and trial production of light industry machinery and equipment; 3. Continuing to strive to increase the variety of new products and improve the quality of existing products to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets; 4. Attaching importance to and carrying out economic analysis of light industrial products, so that the quality of light industrial products is improved, the trial production of new products is closely integrated with the implementation of rational and beneficial economic principles.

    In the past, light industry science and technology work was concentrated in a few large cities, and work in many regions had just begun. The meeting emphasized that regions must strengthen technical information work, closely cooperate, and collaborate with each other. In particular, cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Lushun-Dalian, and Guangzhou must play a backbone role and help various regions solve the instrument and equipment problems for carrying out science and technology work.

    In the past year, with the mutual cooperation of various regions, China's light industry science and technology research work has achieved great success. The paper industry sector has successfully trial-produced many kinds of high-grade industrial paper and rayon pulp using various grass fibers such as rice straw and bagasse, and the quality has reached the specified standards. The canned coating problem that the food industry has not solved for a long time was also solved last year, and the performance in terms of acid resistance and sulfur resistance met the requirements. The electric oscillation tanning method successfully researched by the leather industry can shorten the tanning process of sole leather from the original fifty to sixty days to within ten days, greatly improving the production speed of leather. The silicate industry has used non-metallic materials such as ceramics and glass to make many light industrial and chemical industrial equipment, saving the country a large amount of steel. The fragrance industry initially synthesized fifteen-membered lactones and artificial sandalwood, and promoted the cultivation and extraction of the important natural fragrance plant "Geranium." In addition, the quality of daily necessities such as gold pens, sewing machines, and bicycles has generally improved over the past year after strengthening technical research work.

    After professional discussions, the representatives of various regions determined the research projects for each industry in 1959 according to local resources and technical conditions. The paper industry will continue to study the comprehensive utilization of grass fibers and wild plants, and help people's communes solve the technical problems of normal production of small paper machines. The salt industry has decided to find out the laws of tide level and seawater salinity in existing coastal salt fields, and use methods such as three-dimensional crystallization to increase the yield per unit area of salt fields. The fragrance industry will organize forces this year to comprehensively investigate the status of China's fragrance resources and expand the source of fragrances. More than 170 research projects have been identified in various industries.

    The meeting was attended by 279 technical leaders, scientific researchers and engineering technicians from light industry scientific research departments, production departments and relevant institutions of higher learning in the central government and various provinces, cities and autonomous regions.

    多快好省发展轻工业
    轻工业部召开会议确定今年研究重点和项目
    新华社上海电　轻工业部最近在上海召开了全国轻工业科学技术工作会议。会议根据全国地方科学技术工作会议的精神和当前进一步发展轻工业的要求，讨论和安排了1959年轻工业科学技术工作的计划，并且广泛交流了经验。
    轻工业部副部长邓洁在会上讲了话。他说：目前，轻工业科学技术研究工作的重点是：一、研究各种原材料做到物尽其用；二、研究提高现有设备的机械化程度，提高生产，并且加强轻工业机械设备的研究试制工作；三、继续努力增加新产品的品种和提高原有产品的质量，适应国内外市场的需要；四、重视和开展对轻工业产品的经济分析工作，使轻工业产品质量提高、试制新产品和贯彻合理有利的经济原则密切结合起来。
    过去轻工业科学技术工作集中在少数大城市，许多地区工作还刚开始。会议强调各地区之间必须加强技术情报工作，密切配合，互相协作。特别如北京、天津、上海、旅大、广州等城市要发挥骨干作用，帮助各地解决开展科学技术工作的仪器设备。
    去年一年，在各地相互配合下，我国轻工业科学技术研究工作已经获得很大的成就。造纸工业部门利用稻草蔗渣等各种草类纤维试制成功了许多种高级工业用纸和人造丝浆，质量达到规定的标准。食品工业长期以来没有解决的罐头涂料问题，去年也已获得解决，耐酸、抗硫等方面的性能都符合要求。皮革工业研究成功的用电振荡鞣革的方法，可以把底革的鞣制过程从原来的五十天至六十天缩短到十天之内，大大提高了皮革的生产速度。硅酸盐工业利用陶瓷、玻璃等非金属材料制成了许多轻工业、化学工业所需要的设备，为国家节省了大批钢材。香料工业初步合成了十五内酯和人造檀香等，并且推广了重要天然香料植物“香叶”栽培和提取。另如金笔、缝纫机、自行车等生活用品，在加强技术研究工作以后，一年来质量也普遍提高。
    各地代表按专业经过讨论以后，都根据当地的资源、技术条件，确定了各行业1959年的研究项目。造纸工业一面继续研究草类纤维和野生植物的综合利用，一面帮助人民公社解决小型造纸机正常生产的技术问题。制盐工业决定在现有沿海各地盐场摸清潮位、海水含盐量等规律，采用立体结晶等方法，提高盐田的单位面积产量。香料工业今年将组织力量全面调查我国香料资源的情况，扩大香料的来源。各行业确定的研究项目超过一百七十多个。
    参加会议的有中央和各省、市、自治区的轻工业科学研究部门、生产部门以及有关高等院校的技术领导干部、科学研究人员和工程技术人员共二百七十九人。
