　　Recently, the Economic Delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Comrade Le Thanh Nghi, Minister of Industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, visited our country. During the visit, it held talks with our government on the issue of further strengthening economic mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries and achieved satisfactory results. On February 18, the two sides signed seven documents, including the Agreement on Economic and Technological Assistance from the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Long-Term Trade Agreement between the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments for 1960 to 1962. The signing of these agreements marks a further development of the economic mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Vietnam, and also indicates a further strengthening of the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the two countries.
　　The people of China and Vietnam have a traditional friendship, and both China and Vietnam are fraternal countries in the socialist family. In recent years, the friendly relations and economic mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Vietnam have undergone significant development. The trade volume between China and Vietnam has increased year by year. Through annual trade exchanges, each provides the other with the materials it needs, which helps the development of the economic construction of both countries. In order to help the Vietnamese people quickly restore and develop the national economy, our government has provided the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with 800 million yuan of free assistance, and last year signed an agreement with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to help Vietnam build and expand eighteen industrial enterprises with a portion of this aid.
　　The relationship between socialist countries is a new type of relationship that has never existed in history. As pointed out in the Declaration of the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries: "Fraternal mutual assistance is an inseparable part of their mutual relations. This mutual assistance powerfully embodies the principles of socialist internationalism." The economic mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Vietnam fully embodies this fraternal relationship. Our two countries cooperate with each other economically, provide mutual assistance, and encourage each other, which greatly promotes the economic construction of our two countries and helps our two countries develop their economies on the basis of self-reliance, so as to achieve common economic upsurge.
　　The diligent and brave Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have made great achievements in restoring and developing the national economy through several years of efforts. Vietnam's period of restoring the national economy ended in 1957. Since 1958, Vietnam has entered a new period of further developing its economy and culture in order to gradually transition to socialism. 1958 was the first year of Vietnam's three-year plan for economic and cultural development. A bumper harvest of grain was obtained, and the total industrial output value increased by 16.3% compared with 1957. This year, Vietnam will develop its economy and culture on a larger scale and at a faster pace. The great achievements of the Vietnamese people have given great encouragement to our people. At present, our people are also striving to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958. The rapid development of the economies of China and Vietnam makes economic cooperation and mutual assistance between our two countries even more necessary, and at the same time opens up new and broad prospects for economic mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries.
　　According to the provisions of the Agreement on Economic and Technological Assistance and the exchange of letters on gratuitous assistance and other documents, China will provide Vietnam with a long-term loan of 300 million yuan and gratuitous assistance of 100 million yuan to help Vietnam build 49 industrial and transportation projects, including steel plants, coal mines, shipyards, nitrogen fertilizer plants, power stations, dedicated railway lines, textile mills, and expand paper mills. According to the Sino-Vietnamese Long-Term Trade Agreement for 1960-1962, China will supply materials such as cotton, steel, pyrite, cement bag paper, and bituminous coal, and Vietnam will also supply China with anthracite, cement, apatite, chromite, wood, jute, amomum villosum, and other materials. The signing of the agreement on economic and technological assistance from China to Vietnam and the Sino-Vietnamese long-term trade agreement will ensure the continuous growth of the exchange of goods between the two countries and strengthen mutual coordination and cooperation between the two countries in long-term economic plans. In the Sino-Vietnamese long-term trade agreement and annual trade agreement signed this time, the materials supplied by Vietnam to China are very important for China's current and future production and construction. We will also do our best to supply the materials needed for Vietnam's production and construction. The extensive economic cooperation and strong mutual assistance between China and Vietnam will not only further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries and accelerate the construction of the two countries, but also further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of world peace.
　　We warmly congratulate the complete success of the Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation and trade negotiations, warmly congratulate the rapid development of socialist construction in China and Vietnam, and warmly congratulate the ever-consolidation of the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Vietnam!

    中越经济互助合作的进一步发展
    最近，以越南民主共和国工业部部长黎清毅同志为首的越南民主共和国政府经济代表团访问了我国，在访问期间，同我国政府就进一步加强两国经济互助合作问题举行了会谈，并且获得了圆满的结果。2月18日，双方签订了关于中华人民共和国政府给予越南民主共和国政府经济技术援助的协定和关于中越两国政府1960年到1962年的长期贸易协定等七个文件。这些协定的签订标志着中越两国的经济互助合作关系的进一步发展，也表明了中越两国永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊的进一步加强。
    中越两国人民有着传统的友谊，中越两国都是社会主义大家庭中的兄弟国家。近年来，中越两国的友好关系和经济互助合作有了重大的发展。中越两国贸易额逐年增长，通过每年的贸易往来，彼此提供对方所需要的物资，有助于两国经济建设事业的发展。为了帮助越南人民迅速恢复和发展国民经济，我国政府曾给予越南民主共和国政府八亿元人民币的无偿援助，并于去年同越南民主共和国政府签订了就此项援款中的一部分帮助越南新建和扩建十八项工业企业的协定。
    社会主义国家之间的关系是历史上从未有过的新型的关系。正如社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言中所指出的：“兄弟般的互相援助，是它们的相互关系的不可分割的部分。这种互相援助有力地体现了社会主义的国际主义原则。”中越两国的经济互助合作完全体现了这种兄弟关系。我们两国在经济上彼此合作，互相援助，共同鼓舞，大大推进了我们两国的经济建设，并且有助于我们两国在自力更生的基础上发展经济，以达到经济的共同高涨。
    勤劳勇敢的越南人民，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，经过这几年的努力，已经在恢复和发展国民经济方面取得了巨大的成就。越南恢复国民经济时期已于1957年结束。从1958年起越南已经进入进一步发展经济和文化，以便逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期。1958年是越南发展经济文化三年计划的头一年，粮食获得了空前的大丰收，工业总产值比1957年增加了16.3％。今年越南将以更大的规模和更快的速度发展经济和文化。越南人民的巨大成就给予我国人民以很大的鼓舞。目前，我国人民也正在1958年工农业大跃进的基础上，争取实现1959年的更大的跃进。中越两国经济的一日千里的发展，使我们两国在经济上互相合作、互相帮助更加必要，同时也为我们两国经济互助合作打开了新的广阔的前景。
    根据经济技术援助协定和无偿援助的换文等文件的规定，我国将向越南提供人民币三亿元的长期贷款和一亿元的无偿援助，用来帮助越南新建钢铁厂、煤矿、造船厂、氮肥厂、电站、铁路专用线、纺织厂和扩建造纸厂等四十九个工业交通企业项目。根据1960—1962年中越长期贸易协定规定，我国将供应棉花、钢材、黄铁矿、水泥袋纸和烟煤等物资，越南也将供应我国无烟煤、水泥、磷灰石、铬铁矿、木材、黄麻、砂仁等物资。我国给予越南经济技术援助协定和中越长期贸易协定的签订，将保证两国货物的交换的不断增长，加强两国在长期经济计划方面的互相配合和彼此协作。在这次签订的中越长期贸易协定和年度贸易协定中，越南供应我国的物资对于我国当前和今后生产建设都是很重要的。而对于越南生产建设中所需要的物资，我们也都尽力供应。中越两国在经济上广泛合作，大力互助，不仅将进一步加强我们两国人民的兄弟友谊和加速两国的建设，而且将进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和世界和平的力量。
    我们热烈祝贺中越两国经济合作和贸易谈判圆满成功，热烈祝贺中越两国社会主义建设飞速发展，热烈祝贺中越两国人民永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊日益巩固！
