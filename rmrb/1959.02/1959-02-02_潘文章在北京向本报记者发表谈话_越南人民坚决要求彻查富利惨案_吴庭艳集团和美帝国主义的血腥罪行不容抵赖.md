Phan Van Chuong, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Chairman of the "Committee for the Struggle Against the Phu Loi Massacre," recently arrived in Beijing from Hanoi. He is scheduled to travel to Cairo to attend the Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting scheduled for February 9. On January 31, Mr. Phan Van Chuong met with our newspaper reporter and provided a detailed account of the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre and the Vietnamese people's outrage over the heinous atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, under the direction of the United States, in slaughtering Vietnamese patriots.

Mr. Phan Van Chuong said that in order to suppress and persecute the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the reactionary rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and for the peaceful, democratic reunification of the fatherland, the South Vietnamese authorities have established prisons and concentration camps throughout South Vietnam. They have wantonly arrested South Vietnamese patriots and, under the pretext of "denouncing the Communists" and "eliminating the Communists," have implemented a reign of terror of fascist rule over the South Vietnamese people, subjecting all patriots with a sense of justice to inhuman persecution and slaughter. The Phu Loi massacre was a bloody event in which the Ngo Dinh Diem clique single-handedly carried out a large-scale slaughter of patriots. Mr. Phan Van Chuong particularly emphasized that all these atrocities by the South Vietnamese authorities were carried out under the planning and support of U.S. imperialism. Hu Van Tan, the chief culprit of the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre and the lieutenant deputy warden of the concentration camp, had only recently returned from the United States. He had received specialized training in espionage rule and terror tactics in the United States.

In discussing the political background of the Phu Loi massacre, Mr. Phan Van Chuong believed that the aim of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique was to extinguish the fighting strength of the South Vietnamese people and to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, so as to ultimately transform Vietnam into a U.S. colony and a military base for aggression in Southeast Asia.

Mr. Phan Van Chuong said that these atrocities by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have aroused angry protests and condemnations from the people throughout Vietnam. In recent days, representatives from all walks of life across the country have submitted petitions to the International Commission for Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission conduct an on-site investigation and sanction the murderers responsible for this massacre. This protest movement has now developed into an unprecedentedly large-scale mass demonstration movement in Vietnamese history.

In order to cover up their crimes and eliminate evidence, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is now carrying out intense activities under the instructions of the United States. They are transferring the political prisoners originally held in the Phu Loi concentration camp to other locations, and then planting spies disguised as political prisoners in the concentration camp, plotting to deny and conceal the truth in the event that the International Commission goes to the site for investigation. According to foreign news agency reports, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also issued a statement a few days ago, shamelessly declaring that the Phu Loi massacre was groundless and, on the contrary, slandering the Vietnamese people's protest actions. Mr. Phan Van Chuong said that this shows that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has made prior arrangements for a possible international investigation and is preparing to deny it at that time.

However, no matter what the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy is, the massacre at the Phu Loi concentration camp cannot be covered up. Mr. Phan Van Chuong said that the Vietnamese people will resolutely demand a thorough investigation of the responsibility for this incident, severely punish the murderers, and demand that the International Commission for Vietnam uphold justice and, in accordance with Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam and the Geneva Accords, guarantee the freedom and democratic rights of former resistance personnel and all those who demand peaceful reunification. Mr. Phan Van Chuong also emphasized that no matter how brutal the means of suppression adopted by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the Vietnamese people's struggle for the peaceful, democratic reunification of the fatherland will certainly continue until complete victory is achieved.

    潘文章在北京向本报记者发表谈话
    越南人民坚决要求彻查富利惨案
    吴庭艳集团和美帝国主义的血腥罪行不容抵赖
    本报讯　越南保卫世界和平委员会副主席、“富利惨案斗争委员会”主席潘文章先生日前从河内到达北京。他即将前往开罗参加预定在2月9日召开的亚非团结理事会会议。1月31日，潘文章先生接见本报记者，详细介绍了富利集中营惨案和越南人民为抗议吴庭艳集团在美国指使下屠杀越南爱国者的令人发指的暴行情况。
    潘文章先生说，为了镇压和迫害南越人民反对吴庭艳集团的反动统治和争取祖国和平民主统一的斗争，南越当局已在整个南越遍设监狱和集中营。他们大肆逮捕南越爱国者，在“控诉共产党”和“消灭共产党”的借口下，对南越人民实行恐怖的法西斯统治，对一切稍有正义感的爱国人士进行非人道的迫害和残杀。富利惨案就是吴庭艳集团所一手制造的大规模屠杀爱国者的血腥事件。潘文章先生特别强调指出，南越当局的这一切暴行，都是在美帝国主义的策划和支持下干出来的。这次富利集中营惨案的罪魁、集中营的中尉副典狱官胡文晋，就是不久前才从美国回来的。他曾在美国受过专门的特务统治和恐怖手段的训练。
    在谈到富利惨案的政治背景时，潘文章先生认为，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的目的是要扑灭南越人民的斗争力量，阻挠越南的和平统一，以便最后把越南变成为美国的殖民地和东南亚的一个军事侵略基地。
    潘文章先生说，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的这种暴行，已激起了越南全国人民的愤怒抗议和谴责。连日来，全国各阶层人民的代表，纷纷向越南国际委员会提出建议书，要求国际委员会进行实地调查，制裁应对这次惨案负责的凶手。现在这种抗议行动已发展成为越南历史上空前规模的群众示威运动。
    为了掩盖罪行和消灭罪证，吴庭艳集团现在正在美国的授意下进行紧张的活动。他们把原来囚禁在富利集中营的政治犯调往别处，然后把一些伪装作政治犯的特务安插到集中营里，阴谋在万一国际委员会前往现场调查时进行抵赖和掩饰。据外国通讯社的消息，吴庭艳集团在前几天还发表声明，居然无耻地宣称富利惨案没有根据，并反过来对越南人民的抗议行动进行诬蔑。潘文章先生说，这表明吴庭艳集团已经对可能进行的国际调查事先作了布置，准备届时进行抵赖。
    但是，不管吴庭艳集团的阴谋如何，富利集中营的惨案是掩盖不住的。潘文章先生说，越南人民将坚决要求彻底追究这次事件的责任，严惩凶手，并要求越南国际委员会主持正义，根据越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款和日内瓦协议的规定，保障前抗战人员和一切要求和平统一人士的自由民主权利。潘文章先生并且强调指出，不管美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团采取多么残暴的镇压手段，越南人民争取祖国和平民主统一的斗争将一定进行到取得彻底胜利为止。
