    Striving for 18 Million Tons of Steel

    This year is the decisive year in the three years of hard struggle. Whether we can win the victory in this decisive year largely depends on how well we can complete 18 million tons of steel. Fighting for 18 million tons of steel is a central task for the people of our country this year. We must unleash soaring drive to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this great leap forward target.

    Why does 18 million tons of steel have a decisive impact on this year's Great Leap Forward and the subsequent Great Leap Forwards in the years to come? This is because 18 million tons of steel is a symbol of a great leap forward. It means that our country's steel production will increase by nearly 7 million tons in one year, which is the most important guarantee for the continued leap forward of the entire national economy. Within the industrial sector, there are two types of industries that have a significant impact on the development of the entire industry. One is processing industries such as machinery manufacturing, and the other is raw material industries such as steel and coal. Raw material industries, in particular, are the foundation of industrial development. Without raw materials, processing industries cannot continue to develop, and the existing equipment capacity cannot be fully utilized. Every sector of the national economy is closely related to steel. Chairman Mao said: "With grain and steel, everything is easy to handle." In the past, our country was an extremely steel-deficient country with a very weak foundation. Although our country's steel production last year doubled compared to the previous year, we still feel a shortage of steel when arranging various construction projects this year. Without solving the steel problem, the entire industry cannot move forward, and agriculture cannot achieve greater development. In the future, the fundamental problem of agriculture in our country is to realize mechanization and electrification, and to improve labor productivity. By focusing on steel, we can drive machinery, electricity, coal, transportation, and other sectors, and the mechanization of agriculture will become promising. Such a policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward will continue to be implemented in the coming period. It is a powerful weapon for promoting the high-speed, planned, and proportional development of the entire national economy.

    At the same time, from the perspective of long-term development, achieving the task of reaching a steel production of 18 million tons this year also has profound significance. This means that our country's steelmaking equipment capacity will be raised to a higher level, laying a solid foundation for future continued great leap forwards. Steelmaking equipment capacity is one of the important symbols of a country's industrial potential. It can produce steel for us this year, and it can also produce steel for us next year. This is where industry differs from agriculture. When grain is harvested, it needs to be replanted from scratch the following year; when steel is produced, the equipment is still there, and steel can be produced without rebuilding the furnace the following year, or even more steel. At the end of last year, when we reached more than 11 million tons of steel, our steelmaking equipment capacity reached about 20 million tons. This year, when we reach an annual output of 18 million tons of steel, in addition to Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel and other modern large-scale iron and steel complexes will be partially put into production, dozens of medium-sized iron and steel complexes will also be built or partially built, and hundreds of small iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods will be spread all over the country. A steel production network is being deployed across the country, and our country's steelmaking equipment capacity will reach a higher level. Its scale and technical level will be much larger and higher than last year. This is the material basis for the greater leap forward of China's steel industry in the future, and also the material basis for the greater leap forward of other industries and transportation. With this larger foundation, future leap forwards will be easier. Therefore, the gains that completing this year's leap forward plan of 18 million tons of steel will bring us are not just 18 million tons of steel, but a huge leap in the material strength and technical level of the steel industry. This is of decisive significance for the continued and continuous leap forward of the steel industry next year, the year after, and in the coming period.

    So, can the plan to produce 18 million tons of steel this year be realized? We say: yes. The proposal of this target is based on sufficient grounds. Our main steel equipment strength can already guarantee the production of 18 million tons of steel in one year. The whole party and the whole people have gained rich experience in the battle to massively develop the steel industry last year, and we have begun to find a series of correct policies and methods for developing our country's industry at high speed. This year, as long as we continue to implement these policies and continue to give play to the revolutionary drive of the people, we will surely promote the continued high-speed development of the steel industry. In addition, the task of doubling steel production was only proposed in late August last year. At that time, there were only more than four months left until the end of the year. This year, we are striving for 18 million tons from the very beginning. From now until the end of the year, there are still almost eleven months. In this way, we can make full use of these eleven months, make arrangements early, and seize the opportunity early. These conditions are much stronger than last year. Since we were able to increase steel production by more than 5 million tons last year, and the favorable conditions this year are even greater, why can't we increase steel production by 7 million tons?

    Of course, although the conditions are favorable, continued efforts are still needed. Our full confidence in completing and overfulfilling this year's production task of 18 million tons of steel does not mean that there are no difficulties in this year's steel production. Revolutionary causes without difficulties have never existed. It should be seen that increasing the absolute increase in steel production by 7 million tons in one year is not an easy task. To achieve this goal, we must solve many problems. Only by continuing to give play to the soaring drive, combining the soaring drive with the spirit of scientific analysis, and taking practical measures, working hard, working practically, and working skillfully, can we ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the production plan of 18 million tons of steel.

    In order to complete 18 million tons of steel, a particularly important issue at present is to fight for the rapid development of coke production, so that coke production is adapted to pig iron production. This is the first key to ensuring the completion of this year's production plan of 18 million tons of steel. To complete 18 million tons of steel, the corresponding pig iron production plan must be completed. Without pig iron, steel cannot be made. In order to complete the corresponding pig iron production plan, we need more than twice the amount of coke as last year, and we need coke of good quality. However, relying on our country's existing large and medium-sized modern coking furnaces that will be put into production this year, we still cannot guarantee to fully meet the coke required for ironmaking. Therefore, we must quickly organize forces to massively develop simple coking furnaces, and the quality of coke depends on the quality of coal. Therefore, while massively developing simple coking plants, we also need to massively develop simple coal washing plants, and send the raw coal for coking after washing and sorting, in order to solve the problem.

    In order to complete 18 million tons of steel, we must also fight for iron ore and refractory materials. To complete the pig iron production plan corresponding to the same 18 million tons of steel, there must be sufficient ore and refractory materials. According to the plan, the output of iron ore will double again this year. Key mining enterprises should seize the weak links in production, carry out mass technical revolution movements, improve equipment utilization efficiency, improve production labor organization and operation methods, and do everything possible to tap production potential. The iron mines of the "small indigenous groups" should be actively consolidated, strengthened, and improved. The construction of new mines should be stepped up. The refractory materials industry is a weak link in the metallurgical industry, and work in this area must be strengthened rapidly.

    In order to complete 18 million tons of steel, we must also fight for metallurgical equipment, especially metallurgical mining equipment and rolling mill equipment. The expansion of production capacity of key mining enterprises, the construction of new mines, and the improvement of "small indigenous group" mines all require mining equipment. Steel must become shaped, and materials must be diverse. In addition to stepping up rolling mill production, we must also rush to manufacture new rolling mill equipment and make the equipment complete. These are major tasks that the machinery industry departments must strive to complete.

    When the problems of coke, iron ore, refractory materials, and equipment are solved, there are still many problems in steel production itself that need to be solved. In terms of our equipment capacity, it should be said that there are conditions for completing the production plan of 18 million tons of steel and the corresponding pig iron production plan. However, equipment capacity needs to be brought into play by people. The workers, technicians, and managers fighting next to blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, converters, electric furnaces, and rolling mills should continuously improve their technical level and management level, and tap the potential equipment capacity. The workers on the construction sites of iron and steel enterprises across the country must step up construction work so that new equipment can be put into production as soon as possible. The key projects among them are even more crucial, and we must concentrate material resources, manpower, and financial resources to strongly support and ensure that they are put into production as soon as possible.

    When the problems of steel production itself are solved, the transportation problem must also be solved. In order to complete 18 million tons of steel, a large amount of ore, pig iron, coal, refractory materials, etc. needs to be transported. This is a heavy task for the transportation departments.

    Completing and overfulfilling the production plan of 18 million tons of steel is a task for the whole people. Let us show the same soaring drive as last year, strive for upstream, move forward bravely, continuously and timely solve the problems encountered in the advancement, and realize a greater leap forward in the steel industry!

    为一千八百万吨钢而奋斗
    今年是苦战三年中决定性的一年。我们能不能赢得今年这个决定性一年的胜利，在很大程度上决定于我们如何更好地完成一千八百万吨钢。为一千八百万吨钢而战，是我国人民今年的一项中心任务，我们必须发挥冲天的干劲，保证完成和超额完成这个伟大的跃进指标。
    为什么一千八百万吨钢对于今年大跃进以及今后年年大跃进具有决定性的影响呢？这是因为一千八百万吨钢是一个很大的跃进的标志，它意味着我国的钢产量在一年之间又将增加近七百万吨，这是整个国民经济继续向前跃进的最重要的保证。工业内部各部门有两类工业对整个工业的发展有着重大的关系。一是机械制造等加工工业，一是钢铁、煤炭等原材料工业，而原材料工业尤其是工业发展的基础。没有原材料，加工工业不但不可能继续发展，现有的设备力量也不可能充分发挥作用。国民经济任何一个部门都同钢铁有着密切的关系。毛主席说：“一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了。”我们的国家在过去恰恰是一个极端缺乏钢铁的国家，底子很薄，虽然去年我国的钢产量比前年增加了一倍，但是今年安排各项建设的时候仍然感到钢铁不足。不解决钢铁的问题，整个工业就无法前进，农业也不能得到更大的发展。今后我国农业的根本问题，是实现机械化、电气化，提高劳动生产率的问题。抓住了钢，就把机械、电力、煤炭、交通运输等都带动起来，农业的机械化也就有了指望。这样一个以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，在今后一个时期内，都是要继续贯彻执行的。它是促进整个国民经济高速度、有计划按比例发展的一个有力的武器。
    同时，从长远的发展来看，今年实现钢产量达到一千八百万吨的任务，也有着深远的意义。这意味着我国的炼钢设备能力提高到一个更高的水平，为今后的继续大跃进打下稳固的基础。炼钢设备能力是一个国家工业潜力的重要标志之一，它今年能为我们炼出钢来，明年还能为我们炼出钢来。这是工业同农业不同的地方。粮食收下来了，第二年要从头种起；钢炼出来了，设备却还在那儿，第二年不需要重新建炉就能炼出钢来，甚至炼出更多的钢来。去年年底，当我们拿到一千一百多万吨钢的时候，我们的炼钢设备能力达到二千万吨左右。今年，当我们达到年产一千八百万吨钢的时候，除鞍钢以外，武钢、包钢等现代化大型钢铁联合企业将部分投入生产，几十个中型钢铁联合企业也将建成或部分建成，成百个土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业
  将遍布全国各地，一个钢铁生产网在全国布开来了，我国的炼钢设备能力就将达到一个更高的水平。它的规模、它的技术水平，都将比去年大得多，高得多。这是我国钢铁工业今后更大跃进的物质基础，也是其他工业和交通运输更大跃进的物质基础。有了这个较大的基础，以后的跃进就比较容易了。因此，完成今年一千八百万吨钢的跃进计划，将给我们带来的收获，决不只是一千八百万吨钢，而是钢铁工业物质力量和技术水平的巨大飞跃。这对于明年、后年以及今后一个时期钢铁工业的继续不断地跃进是有决定意义的。
    那么，今年生产一千八百万吨钢的计划能不能实现呢？我们说：能。这个指标的提出是有充分的根据的。我们的钢铁主要设备力量已经能够保证一年生产一千八百万吨钢。全党全民在去年大办钢铁工业的战斗中又得到了丰富的经验，我们开始找到了一系列的高速度发展我国工业的正确方针和办法。今年只要继续贯彻这些方针，继续发挥人民群众的革命干劲，就一定会促进钢铁工业继续高速度的发展。此外，去年是8月下旬才提出钢产量翻一番的任务的，那时距离年底只有四个多月的时间，今年一开始我们就为一千八百万吨而奋斗，从现在到年底还差不多有十一个月。这样我们就可以充分利用这十一个月的时间，就可以早作安排，就可以抓得早。这些条件，都比去年强得多。既然我们去年能够增加五百多万吨钢，今年的有利条件更多，我们为什么不能把钢的产量增加七百万吨呢？
    当然，条件虽然有利，仍需继续努力。我们有充分的信心完成和超额完成今年一千八百万吨钢的生产任务，并不是说今年的钢铁生产什么困难也没有了。没有困难的革命事业，从来是不存在的。应当看到，在一年之中把钢的绝对增产量增加七百万吨，并不是轻而易举的事情。要达到这个目标，就必须解决许多问题。只有继续发挥冲天的干劲，并且把冲天干劲和科学分析的精神结合起来，采取切实的措施，苦干实干巧干，才能保证完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢的生产计划。
    为了完成一千八百万吨钢，目前一个特别重要的问题是为迅速发展焦炭生产而战，使焦炭生产与生铁生产相适应。这是确保今年完成一千八百万吨钢的生产计划的第一个关键。完成一千八百万吨钢，必须完成相应的生铁生产计划。没有生铁炼不成钢。为了完成相应的生铁生产计划，就需要数量比去年增加一倍以上的焦炭，并且需要质量好的焦炭。但是依靠我国现有的和今年内将投入生产的大中型现代化炼焦炉，还不能保证充分满足炼铁所需要的焦炭。因此，必须迅速组织力量大搞简易炼焦炉，而焦炭的质量又决定于煤的质量，因此和大搞简易炼焦厂的同时，还需要大搞简易洗煤厂，把原煤经过洗选再送去炼焦，才能解决问题。
    为了完成一千八百万吨钢，还要为铁矿石和耐火材料而战。完成同一千八百万吨钢相应的生铁生产计划，必须要有足够的矿石和耐火材料。根据计划的安排，今年铁矿石的产量还要再翻一番。重点矿山企业应该抓住生产中的薄弱环节，开展群众性的技术革命运动，提高设备利用效能，改善生产劳动组织和操作方法，千方百计地挖掘生产潜力。“小土群”的铁矿应该积极整顿、巩固和提高。新矿山的建设工作更应该抓紧。耐火材料工业是冶金工业中的一个薄弱环节，这方面的工作必须迅速加强。
    为了完成一千八百万吨钢，还要为冶金设备、特别是冶金矿山设备和轧钢设备而战。重点矿山企业生产能力的扩大、新矿山的建设和“小土群”矿山的提高，都需要矿山设备。钢要成材、材要多种，除了抓紧轧钢生产外，还要赶制新的轧钢设备，并且使设备成套。这些都是机械工业部门必须努力完成的重大任务。
    焦炭、铁矿石、耐火材料和设备的问题解决了，钢铁生产本身也还有许多问题需要解决。以我们的设备能力来说，完成一千八百万吨钢的生产计划和相应的生铁生产计划，应该说是有条件的。但是，设备能力要人去发挥。战斗在高炉、平炉、转炉、电炉和轧钢机旁的工人、技术人员和管理人员们，应该不断地提高自己的技术水平和管理水平，把潜在的设备能力挖掘出来。在全国各地钢铁企业建设工地上的职工们，必须加紧建设工作，让新的设备早日投入生产。其中的重点工程更是关键所在，必须集中物力、人力、财力，大力支援和保证它们及早投入生产。
    钢铁生产本身的问题解决了，还有交通运输问题也必须解决。为了完成一千八百万吨钢，需要运输大量的矿石、生铁、煤、耐火材料等等，这是交通运输部门的繁重的任务。
    完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢的生产计划，是一项全民的任务。让我们拿出像去年那样的冲天干劲，力争上游，勇敢向前，不断地、及时地解决前进中所遇到的问题，实现钢铁工业更大的跃进！
