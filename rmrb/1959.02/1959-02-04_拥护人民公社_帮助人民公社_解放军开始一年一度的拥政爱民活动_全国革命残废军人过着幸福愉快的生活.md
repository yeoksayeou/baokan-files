Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Recently, various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have successively begun their annual campaign to support the government and cherish the people. This year is a year of the Great Leap Forward for the motherland, and the activities of "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month" are much richer than in previous years.

This year, the PLA's activities to support the government and cherish the people are centered on supporting the people's communes, and all units are starting by helping the people's communes with production and construction. In areas like Weitou and Dadeng on the Fujian Front, the first project of "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month" is to carry out a "Manure Collection Week." On January 23rd, they helped the local people's communes dig up more than 470,000 jin of sea mud fertilizer; troops stationed in Quanzhou dug up and transported more than 2.4 million jin of sea mud fertilizer in one day. In Guangdong, many troops have proposed that each person do something for the people's communes during Support the Government and Cherish the People Month. Encouraged by this slogan, a certain unit has recently helped local communes repair more than 300 pieces of farm equipment, two tractors, and three bridges. At the end of last month, this unit also dispatched a group of people to help the people's communes build a reservoir that can irrigate 50,000 mu of land and establish a small power station. They plan to complete this project before the Spring Festival as a gift for "Support the Government and Cherish the People Month." The activities of the garrison in Heilongjiang to help the people's communes are blooming everywhere. One company of a certain unit has dispatched a group of skilled soldiers since the 31st, some to install electric lights for Xizuo Village in the suburbs of Harbin, and others to help another village install wired broadcasting. Doctors from military hospitals have also often carried medicine bags to the countryside to treat commune members these days. In Shanxi and Hebei, some troops have also made plans to help communes run canteens, nurseries, and arrange clubs in an organized way. Some troops also help communes sweep the streets and beautify the environment, so that every village and commune is clean and tidy.

In order to help various places solve the problem of tight transportation during the Spring Festival, various units have also dispatched a large number of vehicles to support local transportation. The troops in the Jinan area dispatched 480 cars to support local transportation. The troops on the Fujian Front dispatched more than 500 cars to participate in local transportation from January 22nd. A naval unit helped the Shanghai vegetable market transport 390 tons of vegetables and helped Changshan Island transport 200 tons of non-staple foods and daily necessities. In order to enable coastal people to return home to celebrate the Spring Festival, they are also prepared to dispatch some ships to help transport passengers according to the needs of local shipping departments.

Various units have also organized a number of comfort groups, ready to visit local party and government organs, people's communes, and various mass organizations during the Spring Festival. The comfort group organized by a certain unit, composed of more than 80 people, includes leading cadres, model figures, and military amateur performance teams and film projection teams. In addition to preparing to report the situation of the unit's Great Leap Forward to the local authorities, they will also organize various discussion meetings to solicit the opinions of the people on the unit. Cultural troupes and various amateur performance teams are also rushing to rehearse programs, preparing to perform for the people in the驻地 during the Spring Festival. A certain unit has also trained 75 propagandists, preparing to go to the countryside to explain the achievements of the motherland's construction to the commune members in a simple way.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Twenty-four sanatoriums have been established across the country for revolutionary disabled soldiers. The glorious revolutionary disabled soldiers who shed blood for the people and made contributions to the country in the revolutionary war are now living happy and joyful lives.

These sanatoriums are mostly built in places with beautiful scenery, some at the foot of Mount Tai and Mount Hua, and some by Taihu Lake. The houses in the sanatoriums are spacious, and the facilities for medical treatment, study, recreation, and sports are very complete. Some sanatoriums also have dairy farms and apiaries to improve the health of revolutionary disabled soldiers.

The state has established prosthetic factories specifically for revolutionary disabled soldiers, providing them with free prosthetic installation and plastic surgery. The state has also set up sanatoriums specifically for the timely treatment of revolutionary disabled soldiers who have wound relapses, chronic diseases, or post-injury sequelae.

The leadership of the sanatoriums earnestly helps revolutionary disabled soldiers with political and cultural studies. The revolutionary disabled soldiers are very enthusiastic about learning. Some who originally did not know a single character now generally have a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school student; those who had read some books now have a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior high school student. The revolutionary disabled soldiers in the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium are mostly from worker and peasant backgrounds and had not studied in the past. However, in recent years, under the care of the Party, they have worked hard and diligently, overcoming the difficulties brought about by their disabilities. Two years ago, they eliminated illiteracy, and about 20% of them reached the cultural level of junior high school and high school. The blind convalescents have all learned Braille. Xie Guanhua, a disabled soldier from the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium, had both hands amputated and is a first-class disabled person. Through hard study and practice, he not only learned to write but also learned to draw pictures. Now, this tenacious person without hands can even draw comic strips and write work summaries. After improving their health and raising their cultural level, revolutionary disabled soldiers in many places have been sent to revolutionary disabled soldiers schools for further study, and some have also participated in work suitable for their physical conditions.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary disabled soldiers in various places has become even higher. They have put forward slogans such as: "Give one point of heat, emit one point of light, and be a person who is never disabled." At the request of the revolutionary disabled soldiers, many sanatoriums have organized amateur performance groups, confident that they will still be excellent soldiers on the propaganda front. Many people have promoted revolutionary optimism in literary and artistic performances, overcoming numerous difficulties, and learning new programs. Some revolutionary disabled soldiers without hands have learned to play the piano and harmonica, some revolutionary disabled soldiers with only one hand have learned to play the flute and Xiao, and some blind revolutionary disabled soldiers have learned several musical instruments.

Many revolutionary disabled soldiers in various sanatoriums are also actively engaged in literary and artistic creation activities. In the past year, the revolutionary disabled soldiers in the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium wrote more than 400 poems, songs, and various performance materials.

During their recuperation in the sanatoriums, revolutionary disabled soldiers also participated in various productive activities within their capabilities, such as cultivating fruit trees, raising livestock and poultry, planting crops, as well as sewing, embroidery, and weaving. Some sanatoriums have also established small factories for knitting, cotton spinning, nail making, rayon, chemical fertilizers, and food processing. Through productive labor, the physical and mental health of revolutionary disabled soldiers has been enhanced, the content of their lives has been enriched, and they are living more happily.

During this year's New Year, many party, government, and military leaders in many regions went to the revolutionary disabled soldiers sanatoriums to express their condolences. Some regions also sent theater troupes to the sanatoriums for comfort performances. (Attached picture)

    拥护人民公社  帮助人民公社
    解放军开始一年一度的拥政爱民活动
    全国革命残废军人过着幸福愉快的生活
    新华社3日讯  最近几天，中国人民解放军各兵种部队相继开始了一年一度的拥政爱民活动。今年是祖国大跃进的一年，“拥政爱民月”的活动比往年丰富得多。
    今年，部队的拥政爱民活动是以拥护人民公社为中心，各部队都是从帮助人民公社生产建设着手的。福建前线围头，大登等地的部队，“拥政爱民月”里第一个项目是开展“积肥运动周”，上月23日，他们帮助驻地人民公社挖海泥肥料四十七万多斤；驻泉州的部队一天挖运海泥肥料二百四十多万斤。在广东，许多部队提出拥政爱民月里每人为人民公社做一件事。某部在这个口号的鼓舞下，最近几天帮助当地公社修好了三百多件农具，两部拖拉机，三座桥梁。这支部队在上月底还抽出一批人力，帮助人民公社兴建一个可灌溉五万亩土地和建立一座小型发电站的水库，他们准备在春节前完成这项工程，作为“拥政爱民月”的献礼。黑龙江驻军帮助人民公社的活动，遍地开花。某部一连，从31日起出动一批有技术的战士，有的为哈尔滨市郊西柞屯安装电灯，有的帮助另一个村庄安装有线广播。军医院的医生，这几天也常常背着药包到乡间为社员看病。在山西、河北，有些部队还订出规划，有组织地帮助公社办食堂、托儿所，布置俱乐部。有的部队还帮助公社打扫街道，美化环境。使村村社社都干干净净。
    为帮助各地解决春节期间运输紧张问题，各部队还抽出大批车辆支援地方运输。济南地区部队抽出四百八十辆汽车，支援地方运输。福建前线部队抽出五百多辆汽车，从上月22日起参加地方运输。海军某部帮助上海菜市场运输了三百九十吨蔬菜，帮助长山岛运输了二百吨副食品、日用品。为了使沿海人民能够回家欢度春节，他们还准备根据当地航运部门的需要，抽出部分船只帮助运送旅客。
    各部队还组织了一批慰问团，准备在春节期间慰问当地党政机关、人民公社和各群众团体。某部组织的八十多人的慰问团中，有领导干部、模范人物和军人业余演出队和电影放映队，他们除了准备向地方报告部队大跃进的情况外，还要组织各种座谈会，征求人民群众对部队的意见。文工团和各个业余演出队也在赶排节目，准备春节期间向驻地人民拜年时演出。某部还培养了七十五名宣传员，准备下乡向社员通俗地讲解祖国建设成就。
    新华社3日讯全国各地为革命残废军人建立了二十四所教养院。在革命战争中为人民流过鲜血为国家立过功劳的光荣的革命残废军人们，现在都过着幸福愉快的生活。
    这些教养院大都建立在风景优美的地方，有的在泰山和华山的脚下，有的在太湖边上。院里的房子宽敞，医疗、学习、文娱、体育等方面的设备都很齐全。有些教养院为了增进革命残废军人的健康，还设有牛奶场、养蜂场。
    国家专为革命残废军人建立了假肢工厂，免费给他们安装假肢和整形。国家还专门设立了疗养院，给那些因伤口复发、有慢性病或伤后遗症的革命残废军人以及时的治疗。
    教养院的领导方面认真帮助革命残废军人进行政治和文化学习。革命残废军人们的学习热情都很高，一些原来一字不识的，现在大都有了相当于高小的文化水平；原来读过一些书的，现在有的已达到相当于高中的文化水平。四川省革命残废军人教养院的革命残废军人绝大部分都是工农出身，过去没有读过书。但近几年来，他们在党的关怀下，勤学苦练，克服了残废给他们带来的困难，两年以前就扫除了文盲，并约有20％的人达到初中和高中的文化程度。双目失明的休养员都学会了盲文。河北省革命残废军人教养院残废军人解冠华，两手截除，是一等残废，他苦学苦练，不但学会了写字，还学会了画图画，现在这位没有手的顽强的人，竟已能画连环画，写工作总结。许多地方的革命残废军人在增进了健康和提高了文化水平以后，被送到革命残废军人学校深造，有的还参加了适合他们身体条件的工作。
    从1958年大跃进以来，各地革命残废军人的革命热情更加高涨。他们提出口号说：有一分热发一分光，做一个永不残废的人。许多教养院在革命残废军人的要求下，组织了业余演出组织，他们自信在宣传战线上仍旧会是一个出色的战士。许多人在文艺演出中，发扬了革命乐观主义精神，克服重重困难，学习新的节目。有些没有双手的革命残废军人学会了弹琴、吹口琴，有些只有一只手的革命残废军人学会了奏笛和吹箫，有些失明的革命残废军人学会了几种乐器。
    各教养院的许多革命残废军人并且积极从事文艺创作活动。四川省革命残废军人教养院的革命残废军人，在去年的一年中就写出诗词和各种演唱材料等四百多篇。
    革命残废军人在教养院休养期间，还参加了各种力所能及的生产，如栽培果树、饲养家畜家禽、种植农作物，以及缝纫、刺绣、编织等。有的教养院还建立了针织、棉纺、制钉、人造纤维、化学肥料、食品加工等小工厂。通过生产劳动，增强了革命残废军人的身心健康，丰富了生活内容，使他们生活得更加愉快。
    今年新年期间，许多地区的党政军负责人都到革命残废军人教养院进行慰问，有些地区还派出剧团到教养院作慰问演出。（附图片）
