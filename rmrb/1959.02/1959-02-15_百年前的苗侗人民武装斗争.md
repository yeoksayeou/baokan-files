    Armed Struggles of the Miao and Dong Peoples a Century Ago
    Xiao Ming, Xiang Ling
    In southeastern Guizhou, on the main peak of the steep Miaoling Mountains, Mount Leigong, there is a high platform made of stones. Legend has it that this is where Zhang Xiumei, the leader of the Miao peasant uprising army, reviewed his troops more than a century ago.
    In 1855, the Miao people in southeastern Guizhou, unable to endure the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Qing rulers and influenced by the Taiping Rebellion, rose up to resist the oppressors. The hero who led the Miao peasant uprising was Zhang Xiumei. Zhang Xiumei grew up in a poor Miao peasant family in Wenggang Village, Taijiang County, northeast of Mount Leigong. When he raised the banner of revolt, Zhang Xiumei sang to his peasant brothers about his family's plight:
    In the Xin-You year of famine,
    Rice roots were eaten bare,
    Bracken roots on the mountains were all dug up,
    The cries of old and young shook the mountains.
    My mother had little say,
    Life was hard, borrowing money and grain,
    After three years and five years of debt,
    A shēng of rice became a dòu and a half.
    Zhang Xiumei's uprising shook Mount Leigong, awakening the peasants of all ethnic groups who had long been oppressed and exploited along the Qingshui River. Peasants' armed forces led by Yang Dalu, Jiu Ta Bie, and Bao Dadu responded one after another. These uprising peasants sang, "Everyone carries a musket, everyone carries a fuse, go to Wenggang Village, and rely on Zhang Xiumei," and supported Zhang Xiumei as their leader.
    In March 1855, Zhang Xiumei led thousands of peasant armed forces, bravely and tenaciously fighting in southeastern Guizhou, and successively captured Kaili, Guzhou, Shibing, Duyun, Qingjiang, Huangping, Qingping and other towns, with great momentum and irresistible force. Zhang Xiumei took advantage of the victory to advance, invincible. The Miao peasant uprising army advanced north to Sichuan, south to Guangxi, and east to Hunan. At this time, they also established contact and cooperation with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, winning successive battles and achieving brilliant victories.
    In 1866, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's power gradually weakened and suffered fundamental defeat. The Qing government then transferred a large number of troops from Hunan, Guangxi, and other places to counterattack Guizhou in several routes. The Miao uprising army resolutely resisted, and the struggle lasted for three years before retreating to Mount Leigong in 1869. The uprising army, together with the masses on Mount Leigong, engaged in both production and combat, persisting for three years. In 1872, the Miao uprising struggle, which lasted for eighteen years, weakened and failed. On April 6, Zhang Xiumei and other peasant revolutionary leaders were captured and heroically sacrificed in Changsha.
    Zhang Xiumei sacrificed himself, and Zhang Xiumei's deeds have been passed down among the Miao people. The Miao people sing Zhang Xiumei's last words:
    Brothers!
    This spring (this life) I am leaving!
    I, Zhang Xiumei, may die,
    But the cause of the Miao people will not end.
    Next spring (next life) I will come back,
    And we will rise again.
    When the Qing soldiers are defeated,
    The Miao people will have good food and clothing,
    The fields will be ours to cultivate,
    The houses will be ours to live in,
    We will go to the hills to socialize,
    And the girls will have flowers to embroider.
    While Zhang Xiumei was leading the Miao peasants to resist the Qing rulers, in 1855, the Dong people living in the lower reaches of the Qingshui River and the Duliu River basin also raised the banner of resistance against the Qing rulers. Leading this struggle were Dong peasants Jiang Yingfang, Chen Daliu, Long Haikuan, Li Zijin, Li Ziyin, and others. The Dong uprising army represented the interests of the peasants and initially put forward the slogans of "attack the rich and help the poor" and "land should be cultivated by the peasants themselves," and used poetry to publicize to the broad masses of peasants: "Rich families owe me money, middle-class families you don't say anything, poor families follow me, and I will ensure you have enough to eat every day." The uprising army was disciplined. It adopted a lenient policy of "paying ransoms and surrendering" towards the landlords, relying on the poor peasants to control the landlords and landlord armed forces. It adopted a policy of striving to help the uprising army towards industrial and commercial households. Therefore, order was well maintained in every place, "goods in the towns and markets filled the streets, and people from all directions came to trade." The uprising army received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of peasants, and its momentum was huge. In 1862, the uprising army grew to 100,000 people; it occupied the area of Tianzhu, Jinping, Sansui, Jianhe, Yuping, and Cengong in eastern Guizhou for a long time, and closely cooperated with the Miao uprising army led by Zhang Xiumei, entering Hunan five times, shaking the two provinces of Hunan and Guizhou.
    In August 1862, when the main force of the peasant army marched east into Hunan and the rear was sparsely guarded, the Qing army attacked the Jiulong Mountain, the base of the uprising army, and the leader of the uprising army, Jiang Yingfang, was captured and sacrificed. The Dong peasants turned grief into strength and continued to fight the enemy under the leadership of Jiang Yingfang's comrade-in-arms, Chen Daliu, and others. Until 1868, due to the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the weakening of Zhang Xiumei's forces, the Qing rulers mobilized forty-eight battalions of troops to counterattack the Dong uprising army. The Dong peasants persisted in resisting until October of the same year in the face of overwhelming odds and failed. This struggle lasted for fourteen years.

    百年前的苗侗人民武装斗争
    晓鸣　向零
    在贵州东南部，陡峻的苗岭山脉主峰雷公山顶峰上，有一个石头垒成的高台子，传说这是一百多年前苗族农民起义军领袖张秀眉点将的地方。
    1855年，贵州东南部的苗族人民，不堪清朝统治者的残酷压迫和剥削，又受到了太平天国革命的影响，纷纷起来抵抗压迫者。领导苗族农民起义的英雄是张秀眉。张秀眉生长在雷公山东北部台江县翁刚寨一个苗族贫农的家庭里。揭杆起义的时候，张秀眉向他的农民弟兄们唱着自己的家境：
    辛酉年间闹灾荒，
    稻根吃得秃光光，
    山上厥根都挖净，
    老幼哭声震山乡。
    我的母亲少主张，
    生活难度借钱粮，
    欠了三年又五载，
    升米变成斗半粮。
    张秀眉的起义震撼了雷公山，唤醒了清水江畔长期受压迫受剥削的各族农民。先后响应的有以杨大陆、九它别、报大肚等为首的农民武装。这些起义的农民唱着“个个扛鸟枪，人人带火绳，去到翁刚寨，投靠张秀眉”，拥戴张秀眉为领袖。
    1855年3月，张秀眉领导着数千农民武装，英勇顽强地转战于贵州东南部，先后攻克了凯里、古州、施秉、都匀、清江、黄平、清平等城镇，声势浩大，势如破竹。张秀眉乘胜挺进，所向无敌。苗族农民的起义武装，北上四川，南下广西，东进湖南。这时，还同太平天国取得了联系与配合，连战连捷，胜利辉煌。
    1866年太平天国势力逐渐削弱，并遭受了基本性失败。清朝政府才从湖南、广西等地抽调大量兵力，分路向贵州反扑。苗族起义军坚决抵抗，斗争持续了三年，1869年才退守雷公山。起义军在雷公山同群众一起，一边生产一边战斗，坚持了三年。1872年，前后历时十八年的苗族起义斗争势弱告败。4月6日，张秀眉等农民革命领袖被俘后，在长沙英勇牺牲。
    张秀眉牺牲了，张秀眉的事迹一直传颂在苗族人民之间。苗族人民歌唱张秀眉的遗言：
    兄弟们哟！
    今春（这一生）我去啦！
    死我张秀眉，
    苗家事不休。
    二春（下一生）我回来，
    我们再起事。
    清兵打倒了，
    苗家吃穿好，
    田归我们种，
    房归我们住，
    坡上去游方，
    姑娘有花绣。
    在张秀眉领导苗族农民反抗清朝统治者的同时，1855年，聚居在清水江下游和都柳江流域的侗族人民，也举起了反抗清朝统治者的义旗。领导这次斗争的是侗族贫农姜应芳、陈大六、龙海宽、李子金、李子银等人。侗族起义军代表农民利益，一开始就提出“打富济贫”“土地应归农民自耕自种”的口号，并且用诗歌向广大农民群众宣传“大户人家欠我钱，中户人家你莫言，小户人家跟我走，每天叫你吃饱饭”。起义军纪律严明。对地主采取了“纳款投降”，给予宽大的政策，依靠贫苦农民管制地主和地主武装。对工商户采取了争取帮助起义军的政策。因而每克一地秩序井然，“市镇货物填街塞巷，四方争来贸易”。起义军受到广大农民热烈的拥护，声势浩大。1862年起义军发展到十万之众；长期雄居黔东的天柱、锦屏、三穗、剑河、玉屏、岑巩一带，并与张秀眉领导下的苗族起义军密切配合，五进湖南，威震湘黔两省。
    1862年8月清军乘农民军主力东进湖南，后方留守空虚之际，袭击了起义军根据地九龙山，起义军领袖姜应芳被俘牺牲。侗族农民化悲愤为力量，在姜应芳的战友陈大六等领导下，继续同敌人搏斗。直到1868年，由于太平天国的失败，张秀眉力量的削弱，清朝统治者调集四十八营军力，向侗族起义军反扑，侗族农民在众寡悬殊情况下，坚持抵抗到同年10月而失败。这次斗争前后坚持了十四年。
