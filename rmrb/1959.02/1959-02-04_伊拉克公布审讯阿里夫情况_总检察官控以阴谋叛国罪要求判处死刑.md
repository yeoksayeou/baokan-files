Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 2nd: The Iraqi government announced on February 1st the details of the interrogation of Arif, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and Minister of Interior of the revolutionary government, who is accused of conspiracy and treason. Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast the actual recording of the trial. The Iraqi people listened to the radio broadcast at home and gathered in various public places.

    The first interrogation of Arif was conducted on December 27th. Prosecutor General Colonel Majid Muhammad Amin accused the defendant of the following crimes: First, "The defendant participated in organizing and leading an illegal group of officers who led cavalry battalions and troops within the armed forces, attempting to launch a coup between November 4th and 5th (1958) to overthrow and change the current regime." Second, the defendant made every effort to assassinate Prime Minister Qasim and it has been confirmed that he "drew a pistol in the Prime Minister's office intending to kill Qasim."

    Therefore, the prosecutor requested that the defendant be sentenced to death.

    The prosecutor explained the defendant's activities and conspiracies. He pointed out that Arif cooperated with imperialists and pseudo-nationalist propagandists who had interests in Iraq. The prosecutor said that Arif "had been actively engaged with the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party group, the propagandists of false nationalism, and other beasts since the early days of the revolution, putting forward confusing slogans aimed at dividing the people so that the defendant and his group could seize power." The prosecutor said that the defendant also "seduced and organized a faction of officers, wooing those who supported him and attacking all those who did not believe in him or recognize his leadership and control." The prosecutor pointed out that there was conclusive evidence that the defendant "did not object to receiving assistance from foreign troops stationed in Jordan and Lebanon to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs and negate the revolutionary achievements of the people."

    The prosecutor emphasized that the line determined by the Iraqi "Free Officers" when preparing for the revolution regarding "the form of relations with other Arab countries" was: "To take the unity of the Iraqi people, namely Arabs and Kurds, as the first step in consolidating the domestic front, and to adopt the principle of solidarity and cooperation with fraternal Arab countries throughout the transition period, after which the people can express their opinions in a referendum to freely choose a system that is in accordance with the will of the majority, whether it takes the form of complete merger, federation, or any other form." The prosecutor pointed out that "the defendant deviated from this line only four days after the revolution," attempting to "undermine the will of the people."

    The prosecutor said that during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister, the defendant seized the printing presses of two newspapers and published the "Republic" newspaper in his own name, "guiding it in a way that contradicted the spirit of the revolution and the democratic provisional constitution. He turned this newspaper office into a center for conspiracies that led to the division of domestic unity and created many gaps that were exploited by imperialists, reactionaries, feudalists, and greedy elements." The prosecutor said that the purpose of these conspiracies was to lead the republic to its demise and restore it to the era of enslavement and complete inclusion in the imperialist sphere of influence.

    The prosecutor referred to the defendant's statement justifying his insistence on not going to Bonn to serve as the ambassador to West Germany. The defendant said: "I would rather the imperialists benefit than let the communists benefit." The prosecutor said that we do not know who the defendant was referring to when he said communists, "Is it referring to the people who have supported the revolution from the very beginning and have united around the leader, and who are still loyally and firmly defending the republic and its principles?"

    The prosecutor also mentioned the defendant's words to an officer: "I regret what I have done. I pay tribute to the soul of Nuri al-Said." The prosecutor pointed out that there is even this psychological state of regretting the glorious act of carrying out a revolution and paying tribute to Nuri al-Said.

    The prosecutor pointed out that after the defendant's true colors were revealed, he adopted the most despicable means of treason and assassination. "When the defendant and his criminal gang failed to assassinate the Prime Minister, this criminal gang continued to operate secretly during the defendant's time in Bonn. There, he tried to link the chains of conspiracy and coordinate it with its conspiracy plans."

    The prosecutor mentioned a rumor before the defendant returned from Bonn: that on November 5, 1958, dangerous events would occur in Iraq, which would have a huge impact on Iraq's domestic and foreign policies, and "the defendant would come to participate in the activities of seizing power." Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed him, asking him to fulfill his duties in Bonn, the defendant suddenly returned to the country on November 4th, which confirmed the truth of the rumors. The prosecutor further said that he even asked the driver who brought him back not to reveal his identity, and he wanted the car to wait for him next to the airport so that he could return to his home unnoticed. The prosecutor pointed out that at that time, the "Republic" newspaper began to promote this conspiracy, saying that "the defendant will participate in demonstrations in Baghdad, holding an image of Qasim, below which is a portrait of Nasser, intending to discard the image of Qasim and raise the image of Nasser after the conspiracy succeeds."

    When talking about Arif's role in the "Free Officers Movement" before the revolution, the prosecutor said that we know very well that the defendant was never one of the founders of this movement, not even one of the earliest Free Officers to join this movement. He only joined this team later in 1956. All the Free Officers at that time opposed accepting him because he was not a person worthy of everyone's trust. But he was accepted because of Qasim's insistence.

    The prosecutor continued, the imperialists, their lackeys, traitors, and all the elements in Iraq who had delusions, began the most despicable conspiracies to undermine the unity of Iraq, conspire to divide the people, undermine their will, and divide beloved Iraq into hostile parts. But their hopes were dashed. The free Iraqi people, under the leadership of their leader Qasim, crushed this attempt at its very beginning and strengthened the unity of the domestic front. They united around their leader and more strongly defended the unity of Kurds and Arabs under the democratic system of the republic.

    伊拉克公布审讯阿里夫情况
    总检察官控以阴谋叛国罪要求判处死刑
    新华社巴格达2日电  伊拉克政府1日公布了对阴谋叛国的革命政府前副总理兼武装部队副总司令和内政部长阿里夫的审讯情况。伊拉克共和国电台广播了审判的实况录音。伊拉克人民都在家里和聚集在各个公共场所听取电台的广播。
    对阿里夫的第一次审讯是在12月27日进行的。总检察官马吉德·穆罕默德·阿明上校控告被告犯有以下罪行：第一、“被告参加组织和领导一个非法的军官集团，他们在武装部队中领导一些骑兵营和部队，想在（1958年）11月4日到5日之间发动政变，推翻和改变现政权”。第二、被告竭力寻求机会暗杀卡塞姆总理，并且已经证实曾经“在总理办公室中掏出手枪想杀死卡塞姆”。
    因此，检察官要求判处被告死刑。
    检察官说明了被告的活动和阴谋。他指出，阿里夫同在伊拉克拥有利益的帝国主义者和伪民族主义鼓吹者合作。检察官说，阿里夫“自从革命的最初几天起就同阿拉伯复兴社会党集团、虚伪的民族主义的鼓吹者和其它畜生一起积极进行活动，提出令人迷惑的口号，目的在于分裂人民，以便使被告和他的集团能够夺取政权。”检察官说，被告还“引诱组织一个军官派别，拉拢那些支持他的军官，打击所有不相信他和不承认他的领导和控制的人。”检察官指出，有确凿的证据证明，被告“并不反对得到驻在约旦和黎巴嫩的外国军队的援助，来干涉伊拉克的内政，使人民的革命成果化为乌有。”
    检察官强调指出，伊拉克“自由军官”在准备革命时确定的关于
  “同其他阿拉伯国家关系的形式问题”的路线是：“把伊拉克人民即阿拉伯人和库尔德族的团结，作为巩固国内阵线的第一步，并采取在整个过渡时期同各阿拉伯姊妹国家团结合作的原则，在这以后，人民可以在全民投票中表示他们的意见，以自由选择出于大多数人民意志的制度，不管它采取完全合并还是联邦的形式或任何其他的形式”。检察官指出，“被告在革命以后才四天，就背离了这条路线”，企图
  “破坏人民的意志”。
    检察官说，被告在他担任副总理期间，夺取了两家报纸的印刷厂，并以自己的名义发行“共和国报”，“以一种与革命的精神和民主的临时宪法相违背的方式来指导它。他把这个报馆变为进行阴谋活动的中心，这些阴谋导致了国内团结的分裂，并且制造了许多被帝国主义者、反动派、封建主义者和贪婪分子利用的空隙。”检察官说，这些阴谋的目的在于使共和国走向灭亡，并使它恢复到奴役和完全加入帝国主义势力范围的年代。
    检察官提到被告为他坚持不去波恩执行驻西德大使的职务进行辩解的谈话。被告说：“我宁愿要帝国主义者获得好处，不愿让共产党获得好处。”检察官说，我们不知道被告所说的共产党是指的谁，“是不是指从最初的时候起就赞成革命并团结在领袖的周围，而现在仍然忠实和坚定地保卫共和国和它的原则的人民呢？”
    检察官还提到被告对一位军官讲的话：“我对我所作的事情感到遗憾。我向努里·赛义德的灵魂致敬。”检察官指出，竟然会有这种对搞革命的光荣行为感到遗憾，并且向努里·赛义德致敬的心理状态。
    检察官指出，在被告的本来面目被揭露之后，他采取了最卑鄙的卖国和暗杀等手段。“当被告和他的犯罪集团没有能暗杀总理的时候，这个犯罪集团在被告在波恩的时期继续秘密地进行活动。他在那里设法把阴谋的锁链联结起来，并且使它和它的阴谋计划协调起来。”
    检察官提到在被告从波恩回来以前的一种流传说： 1958年11月5日伊拉克将发生危险的事件，它将对伊拉克内外政策有巨大的影响，“被告将会来参加夺取政权的活动”。尽管外交部打电报给他，要他在波恩履行他的职责，被告仍然在11月4日突然地回国，这就证实了谣传的真实性。检察官又说，他甚至要求把他运回来的那位驾驶员不要透露他的身份，他要汽车在飞机场旁边等待他，以便在不为人注意的情况下回到他的家里。检察官指出，当时“共和国报”社开始为这一阴谋宣传，并说“被告将参加在巴格达举行的示威游行，拿着卡塞姆的像，在他之下有纳赛尔的画像，意图是要在阴谋成功以后丢掉卡塞姆的画像，而举起纳赛尔的画像。”
    检察官在谈到在革命之前，阿里夫在“自由军官运动”中的作用时说，我们知道得很清楚，被告从来不是这个运动的创始人之一，甚至不是最早参加这个运动的自由军官之一，他只是在后来的1956年才参加了这个队伍。所有的自由军官当时都反对接受他，因为他不是一个值得每一个人信任的人。但是由于卡塞姆的坚持才接受了他。
    检察官继续说，帝国主义者、他们的走狗、卖国贼和所有伊拉克国内有着妄想的分子，开始进行了最卑鄙的阴谋来破坏伊拉克的团结，阴谋分裂人民，破坏他们的意志，把可爱的伊拉克分裂成为一些敌对的部分。但是他们的希望落空了。自由的伊拉克人民在他们的领袖卡塞姆的领导下，在这种企图刚刚开始的时候就予以粉碎，并加强了国内阵线的团结，他们团结在他们的领袖的周围，更坚强地维护库尔德族和阿拉伯人在共和国的民主制度下的团结。
