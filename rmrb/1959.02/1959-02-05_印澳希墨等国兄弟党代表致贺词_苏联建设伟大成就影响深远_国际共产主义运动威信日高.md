Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. At the afternoon session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on March 3rd, the heads of the delegations of fraternal parties from India, Australia, Greece and Mexico delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by those present.

    Comrade Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of India, said in his congratulatory message that the achievements of the Soviet Union in peaceful construction, in science, technology and culture, and in improving the material welfare of the people, have struck at the capitalist ideology and refuted the theories of revisionism. People all over the world believe that the growing power of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp is a reliable guarantee for the peace, freedom and independence of all countries. This is especially true for the people of Asia and Africa, where the colonial system is collapsing and many countries have achieved national independence and embarked on the road of independent development.

    Comrade Hill, member of the Central Political Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, said in his congratulatory message that we are all members of the great international communist army. The Communists in each of our countries are fulfilling their international proletarian obligations and are also loyal patriots of their own countries. We have every reason to be proud of the achievements of all Communists. Hill said that representing comrades and comrades of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, your achievements are the most outstanding of these achievements.

    Hill pointed out that Australia, with its natural resources and hardworking and intelligent people, is facing the threat of economic stagnation and recession. The Communist Party there is suffering from intense attacks. However, neither open reactionaries nor revisionists can shake its firm belief in Marxism-Leninism.

    The next to deliver a congratulatory message was Comrade Grozos, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party. He said that the victories of the Soviet Union, which have world-historical significance, inspire our people. Our people are struggling under difficult conditions to free the country from its dependence on US imperialism, for their freedom and democratic development.

    The arrest of Gleisos and his surrender to a military tribunal has aroused great indignation in Greece and around the world. This was done in accordance with the will of US imperialism and in accordance with the wishes of the Bonn revanchists.

    Comrade Grozos said that we consider it our duty to express our deep gratitude from the platform of this Congress to all Soviet social organizations and all Soviet citizens, as well as to all organizations, social activists and good people all over the world, for rising up to call for the rescue of Gleisos and to oppose the terrorist regime in Greece. In Greece, thousands upon thousands of fighters for democracy have been tortured in prisons or in exile for ten to twelve years.

    Encinas, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Mexico, said in his congratulatory message that the completion of your seven-year plan will strengthen the world socialist camp, further enhance the prestige of the international communist movement, and strengthen the struggle of the masses of people in all countries for peace.
Xinhua News Agency, 4th. According to TASS, Moscow: At the morning session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the 4th, representatives of fraternal parties from nine countries, Belgium, Sweden, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Ceylon, Lebanon, the Netherlands, and Colombia, delivered congratulatory messages.

    Jean Blum, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium, Hilding Hagberg, Chairman of the Communist Party of Sweden, Tim Buck, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada, Luis Corvalán, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Chile, Petro Antonio Saad-Nyheim, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ecuador, and Peter Keuneman, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, unanimously agreed in their speeches that the seven-year plan discussed at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an extremely great program for establishing the material and technical foundation of communism.

    They all particularly emphasized that the Soviet people's realization of this plan will strengthen the power of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp and will consolidate world peace.

    Nicolas Shawi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party, said in his congratulatory message that the Lebanese Communists, together with the people of their country, fought against the Americans who invaded and defiled Lebanese land, and many Lebanese patriots heroically sacrificed themselves. The Communists demonstrated their steadfastness in this struggle, and they are now fighting to consolidate the sovereignty of their country and to strengthen fraternal solidarity with all Arab countries.

    Shawi said that the Lebanese people will always remember with gratitude the large-scale demonstrations held by the Soviet people under the slogan "No interference in Lebanon!".

    Wolf, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, recalled in his congratulatory message the situation in which the Dutch revisionists denied the significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Wolf said that now they have become accomplices of the reactionaries and oppose the Communist Party in elections. Within the Communist Party, the revisionists have been crushed. Now the number of members of the Communist Party of the Netherlands is greater than before the revisionists' attack.

    Gilberto Vieira, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia, said in his congratulatory message that the seven-year plan discussed at this Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the focus of attention of the Colombian people, because this plan is the most magnificent plan ever presented to mankind.

    The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties from the nine countries were warmly welcomed by all those present.

    印澳希墨等国兄弟党代表致贺词
    苏联建设伟大成就影响深远  国际共产主义运动威信日高
    新华社莫斯科3日电　在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会3日下午的会议上，印度、澳大利亚、希腊和墨西哥四国兄弟党的代表团团长向代表大会致贺词。他们的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    印度共产党全国委员会总书记高士同志在贺词中说，苏联在和平建设方面、在科学、技术和文化方面、在提高人民物质福利方面所取得的成就，打击了资本主义思想体系和驳倒了修正主义的理论。全世界人民都认为，苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家不断增长的威力是各国和平、自由和独立的可靠保证。这一点对于亚非各国人民说来尤其是如此，在这里，殖民制度正在崩溃，有许多国家已经取得了民族独立，走上了独立发展的道路。
    澳大利亚共产党中央政治委员会委员希耳同志致贺词时说，我们大家都是伟大的共产主义国际大军的一员。我们每一个国家的共产党人都在履行着自己的国际无产阶级义务，同时也是本国的忠诚爱国者，我们完全有理由为一切共产党人所取得的成就而自豪。希耳说，代表同志们和苏联共产党党员同志们，你们的成就是这些成就之中最杰出的成就。
    希耳指出，有着天然富源、有着勤劳智慧的人民的澳大利亚正面临着经济停滞和衰退的威胁。共产党在那里遭受着强烈的攻击。但是，不论是公开的反动派还是修正主义者，都不可能动摇它对马克思列宁主义的坚定的信仰。
    接着致贺词的是希腊共产党中央委员会主席格罗佐斯同志。他说，苏联的具有世界历史意义的胜利鼓舞着我国人民。我国人民正在困难的条件下为使国家摆脱对美帝国主义的从属关系，为自己的自由和民主发展进行着斗争。
    逮捕格列索斯和把他交给军事法庭的事件引起了希腊和全世界的巨大愤慨。这是按照美帝国主义的意旨并且符合波恩复仇主义者的愿望而作出来的。
    格罗佐斯同志说，我们认为有责任在这个代表大会的讲台上，向苏联各社会团体和全体苏联公民以及向全世界一切组织、社会活动家和善良的人们表示我们深深的感谢，感谢他们起来呼吁拯救格列索斯，反对希腊的恐怖制度。在希腊，成千上万的争取民主的战士在监狱或流放中受折磨已经有十年到十二年了。
    墨西哥共产党中央委员会总书记恩西那在贺词中说，你们七年计划的完成将加强世界社会主义阵营，将更加提高国际共产主义运动的威信，加强各国人民群众争取和平的斗争。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在苏共第二十一次代表大会4 日上午会议上，比利时、瑞典、加拿大、智利、厄瓜多尔、锡兰、黎巴嫩、荷兰、哥伦比亚九个国家兄弟党代表致了贺词。
    比利时共产党中央委员会书记让·布鲁姆、瑞典共产党主席希尔丁·哈格堡、加拿大劳工进步党全国委员会总书记蒂姆·布克、智利共产党
  中央委员会总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰、厄瓜多尔共产党中央委员会总书记彼得罗·安东尼奥·萨阿德—尼亚伊姆和锡兰共产党中央委员会总书记彼得·克尼曼在致词中完全一致地认为苏共第二十一次代表大会所讨论的七年计划是建立共产主义物质技术基础的极其伟大的纲领。
    他们都特别强调指出，苏联人民实现这个计划将会加强苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的威力，将会巩固世界和平。
    黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会书记尼科尔·沙维在贺词中说，黎巴嫩共产党人和本国人民一道进行了反对侵入黎巴嫩和玷污黎巴嫩土地的美国人的战斗，黎巴嫩的很多爱国者英勇牺牲了。共产党人在这个斗争中表现出他们的坚定性，他们现在正在为巩固自己国家的主权，为加强同所有阿拉伯国家的兄弟团结而斗争。
    沙维说，黎巴嫩人民永远怀着感激的心情记着苏联人民在“不准干涉黎巴嫩！”的口号下举行的大规模示威游行。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会委员沃尔夫在贺词中回顾了荷兰修正主义者否认苏共第二十次代表大会的意义的情况。沃尔夫说，现在他们变成了反动派的帮凶，在选举中反对共产党。在共产党内，修正主义者被粉碎了。现在荷兰共产党党员的人数比修正主义者进攻以前更多了。
    哥伦比亚共产党中央委员会总书记希尔伯托·维埃拉在贺词中说，苏共这次代表大会讨论的七年计划是哥伦比亚人民注意的中心，因为这个计划是在人类面前提出的前所未有的最宏伟的计划。
    九个国家兄弟党代表的讲话受到了全体到会者的热烈欢迎。
