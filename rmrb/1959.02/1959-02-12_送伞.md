    Sending an Umbrella
    Wen Nong, Teacher at Taojiang Normal School, Hunan
    One Saturday evening, both Teacher Liu, who shared a room with me, and Teacher Lin from next door went to see a play, leaving me alone in the room grading student compositions.
    Even though it was deep winter, the climate in Jiangnan was still quite warm. Our dormitory was near the station on the Tao-Hui Highway. From outside the window, I could constantly hear the horns of trucks, the shouts of porters, songs from the loudspeakers, and the sounds of oars from the boats under the highway bridge... All of this meant that the footsteps of spring were about to step onto the banks of the Peach Blossom River again.
    I stared blankly at the composition papers: Xie Lin, that clever young fellow, was capable of anything; Lü Ying was a quiet girl, with a pair of eyes and long braids that often revealed some endearing childishness. I labored with them, and I knew them well. Opening each composition was like opening the door to my memories.
    It was back in mid-October of last year, to support steel production, that I led them to Qiwu Village to burn charcoal. One morning, we went up the mountain to cut trees. The male students were responsible for the felling, and the female students were responsible for carrying. The smaller pieces of wood were no problem; they could be carried away. But the larger ones were too heavy for them to move. That's when Lü Ying first came up with the slope-sliding method: sliding the larger pieces of wood down the hillside. It was drizzling, and she was barefoot, her braids coiled behind her head, pushing the logs down the slope one by one with all her might, along with the other students. When I caught sight of them, she shouted loudly, "Teacher, look at our boundless strength!"
    Opening another composition, the shadow of Xie Lin, that clever young fellow, jumped from the paper into my mind again:
    The school's red brick factory started, and there were very few tools. There were only a few clay-cutting bows, which inevitably led to competition on the construction site. After returning to school, he borrowed woodworking tools and made several more in one night. The students all praised his skill. On one occasion, he had just recovered from an illness but insisted on going to the construction site to make bricks. On that late autumn morning, there was already a heavy frost. Working barefoot in the mud was something that required a person with considerable courage. Before I even reached the construction site, he was the first to take off his shoes and socks...
    I flipped through one composition after another, and the figures of the students appeared before my eyes one by one. Suddenly, a strong wind blew outside the window. I looked out and saw that the sky was dark and gloomy. A heavy rain was coming. Teacher Liu and Teacher Lin, who had gone to see the play, hadn't brought rain gear with them tonight. What should I do? It was two or three li to the theater, and we had to cross a highway bridge spanning a small river and walk along a section of road without streetlights. I was figuring out how to take them an umbrella.
    With a "ya" sound, my door opened, and Xie Lin and several other young fellows stood before me.
    "Where are Teacher Liu's umbrella and galoshes?" Xie Lin was the first to speak.
    "Didn't Teacher Liu and Teacher Lin go to see a play? We saw them at the school gate, and they didn't bring umbrellas. It's going to rain heavily; how will they get back?" Xie Lin finished in one breath.
    "They'll get sick if they get rained on," Lü Ying interjected. Only then did I notice that she and several other female students were also standing outside the door.
    I immediately took out the galoshes and umbrella and handed them to Xie Lin. The other young fellows vied to go, but I designated a taller male student to go with Xie Lin, and I also gave him my flashlight.
    The wind stopped, and the raindrops pattered against the tiles. Though the night was late, it still wasn't very cold. Spring seemed to stay in our hearts forever. Facing the stack of compositions, the faces of students who loved to work and loved their teachers appeared before my eyes again. I couldn't help but think that having peach and plum trees filling the garden and eternal youth is the greatest happiness in life.

    送伞
    湖南桃江师范学校教师　文农
    星期六的晚上，与我同房的刘老师和隔壁的林老师都去看戏去了，我独个儿在房中批改学生的作文。
    尽管是深冬了，江南的气候仍然是很温暖的；宿舍临近桃灰公路的车站，窗外不时传来载重汽车的喇叭声、搬运工人的吆喝声、扩音器里的歌声、公路桥下船只的桨声……这一切意味着春天的步伐又快要踏上桃花江的两岸了。
    我面对作文卷出神：谢林那机灵小伙子，什么都能干；吕英是一个闷声不响的姑娘，一对眼睛和两条长长的辫儿不时还显出一些逗人喜爱的孩子气。我同他们一起劳动，我也很熟悉他们，打开每一篇作文，也就打开了我的记忆之门。
    还是去年10月中旬，为了支援钢铁生产，我带他们到七屋村去烧木炭。一天上午，我们到山上去砍树，男同学担任砍伐任务，女同学负责搬运，小的木头没问题，可以扛上就走，大点的她们可搬不动了，这时吕英第一次创造了斜坡滑树法：顺着山坡把大点的木头滑下去。天正下着毛毛雨，她打着一双赤脚，辫儿盘在脑后头一股劲儿和同学们把木头一根一根地往山坡下推。当我一眼发现她们的时候，她高声地喊：“老师，你看我们的力量大无边呵！”
    打开另一本作文，谢林这机灵小伙子的影儿又从纸上跳到我的脑海：
    学校红砖厂开工了，工具少得很，切泥的弓只有几把，在工地上不免发生争夺；回校后他借了木工的斧凿一个晚上就作了好几个，同学们都夸他好手脚。有一次，他病刚刚好，却坚持要去工地作砖。深秋的早晨，已经出现了浓霜，打赤脚踩泥确是一项需要比较有勇气的人才能担任的工作。当我还未赶上工地时，他第一个脱下了鞋袜……
    我一本一本地翻阅，学生们的身影也一个个地出现在我的眼前。这时，窗外陡然刮起大风来，我望望窗外，天空是黑糊糊的。一场大雨就要来了，出去看戏的刘、林老师今晚都没有带雨具去，怎么办呢？这儿离戏院有两三里路，中间还得经过一座横跨小河的公路桥，沿着公路走一段没有路灯的路呢。我正盘算着怎样给他们送伞去。
    “呀”的一声，我的房门打开了，谢林几个小伙子站到了我的跟前。
    “刘老师的伞和套鞋呢？”谢林第一个说话了。
    “刘老师和林老师不是看戏去了吗？我们在校门口看到他们都没有带伞去。下大雨了，怎么能回来呢？”谢林一口气说完了。
    “雨淋湿了会害病的。”吕英插了这么一句，我才发现她同几个女同学也站在门外。
    我立刻拿出套鞋和雨伞交给了谢林。后面的几个小伙子争着要去送，我指定了一个较大的男同学跟谢林一块去，就手又把我的电筒交给了他。
    风住了，雨点打着瓦楞叮叮作响。夜虽深了，却仍然没有多大寒意，春天仿佛永远停留在我们的心里似的。我对着课卷，一个个爱劳动、爱老师的脸庞，又浮现眼前。不禁想到桃李满园，青春长驻真是生活中的最大幸福。
