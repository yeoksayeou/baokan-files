    Ceramics were first invented in China. They have a long history in our country. As early as ancient times, the working people of our country had mastered the method of "burning soil into utensils." At that time, it was called earthenware, which can be regarded as the predecessor of porcelain and pottery. After the Tang Dynasty, China's ceramic industry flourished for a while. Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province, the porcelain capital, has always been famous throughout the world for its exquisite craftsmanship and high quality at reasonable prices.
    Although China's ceramic industry has a long and glorious history, under the feudal rule of the past, especially before liberation under the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, this national craft with excellent traditions not only failed to develop but gradually declined, and even some valuable production experiences were gradually lost. On the eve of the collapse of the Kuomintang regime, only some rough daily-use porcelain could be produced. It was not until after liberation that the moribund ceramic industry embarked on the road of revival.
    In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the active support of the government, the motherland's ceramic industry has not only achieved rapid recovery and development, but also enabled this industry to jump out of the scope of daily-use ceramics and art ceramics production and leap to serve the motherland's science and industrial construction. For example, in the past, both at home and abroad, it was always believed that it was necessary to use steel (or stainless steel) to manufacture oil immersion extractors for refining plants, distillation towers for producing alcohol, gas generators for power, drying cylinders for paper machines, acid-resistant blowers, centrifugal pumps, and motor housings, etc. These mechanical equipment have been made of ceramics and put into production. The world's latest technology equipment for the paper industry, the "continuous digester," has also been trial-produced in Dingshu Town, Yixing. In addition, there are more than a thousand kinds of ceramic tracks, ceramic lathes, lathe cutting tools, ceramic drill bits, etc., to replace steel.
    What is the economic value of using ceramics instead of steel? Taking the paper industry as an example, at present, many steel equipment on general paper machines can be manufactured with ceramics, such as small round nets and the required production equipment such as cooking pots, drying cylinders, suspension frames, and press rolls, all of which can be manufactured with ceramics. Assuming that 2,000 ceramic paper machines are produced this year, tens of thousands of tons of steel can be saved for the country. If we estimate all the equipment that can be replaced by ceramics instead of steel, the total amount of steel saved will be a considerable figure. Therefore, the role of the ceramic industry in my country's economic construction must be fully valued.
    Manufacturing mechanical equipment with ceramic instead of steel not only has great economic value, but also has the following advantages in terms of ceramic performance compared with steel:
      (1) The corrosion resistance is much better than that of steel. Steel is prone to oxidation and rust, and corrodes quickly when exposed to acid. Ceramics do not oxidize, and their acid resistance to hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid is above 98%, and their alkali resistance reaches 49%. Using ceramics as food and chemical equipment is not only much more durable than steel, but also suitable for use as underground pipelines, which can last for many years without damage. Therefore, ceramics are more suitable for food industry equipment, tap water pipes, and water conservancy pipelines.
      (2) The specific gravity is light. Ceramics are about 2.5, while steel is about 7.6. Therefore, ceramic equipment saves materials for the foundation of installation equipment compared to steel equipment.
      (3) The thermal conductivity is about one-thirtieth of that of steel. Using ceramics as low-pressure boilers, cooking tanks, etc., can also save insulation materials.
      (4) The high-temperature resistance is stronger than that of steel. Ceramics can withstand temperatures up to 1900 degrees Celsius, while steel will deform at 1100 to 1500 degrees Celsius.
      (5) The expansion rate of ceramics is half that of steel, so it is not easy to deform. The hardness is ten to twenty times higher than that of steel. Tangshan Porcelain Factory has used ceramics to make alloy steel blades that can be used in the metal processing industry.
    Although ceramics cannot be welded, they can be bonded. For example, acid-resistant cement can be used to bond ceramic heating containers, which is no problem for general chemical, light industry, and food industry equipment. As for the shortcoming that ceramics are easily broken, they can be used for chemical, food, and other equipment with little vibration and no easy collision, various pipelines, and drying cylinders and cooking pots for small paper mills. Equipment for high-grade insulating paper and capacitor paper, the most technically complex in papermaking, can also be considered for ceramics, because ceramics are not easily corroded and are more suitable for process requirements.
    Therefore, using ceramics instead of steel to manufacture mechanical equipment is not a simple temporary substitution for steel, but an advanced technological revolution that meets the requirements of building socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical results. For example, acid-resistant reaction kettles, acid-resistant blowers, acid-resistant centrifugal pumps, insulating materials in the electrical industry, etc., which are indispensable in the chemical industry, must be manufactured with industrial acid-resistant ceramics. Furthermore, certain equipment and equipment in the metallurgical, textile, health, construction, food, and other industries must also be made of chemical ceramics with various properties. The world's latest cutting-edge science and technology also has an unusually close relationship with it. To make high-temperature equipment with a melting point much higher than that of steel, nothing can be done except with special ceramics.
    Therefore, with the rapid development of socialist construction, the development prospects of the ceramic industry are very grand. Taking acid-resistant ceramics as an example, it is widely used in more than 20 light and heavy industries such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, inorganic salts, fertilizers, dyes, organic acids, coking, forestry chemistry, papermaking, petroleum, food, printing, textile, metallurgy, rayon, cables, gunpowder, rubber, and pharmaceuticals. These industries will make great strides forward during the second five-year plan, which will inevitably bring broad prospects for the development of acid-resistant ceramics. Jiangsu Province alone needs tens of thousands of tons of acid-resistant ceramics for its fertilizer industry during the second five-year plan. Furthermore, judging from the demand for ceramic pipes to replace steel pipes, according to preliminary statistics from only five provinces, a total of several thousand kilometers of various pipes are needed. Under this new situation, the ceramic industry has shown broad development prospects. It can be fully expected that on the basis of the victories already achieved in the ceramic industry, even greater achievements will be made this year.

    神通广大的陶瓷
    黄天  华文
    瓷器是我国最先发明的。在我国有悠久的历史，早在远古时代，我国劳动人民就已掌握了“烧土为器”的方法，那时称作瓦器，这要算是瓷器和陶器的前身了。唐朝以后，我国的陶瓷工业曾经兴盛一时。瓷都——江西省景德镇的瓷器产品，一向以技艺精湛和物美价廉而驰名于全世界。
    我国的陶瓷工业虽然有其悠久光辉的历史，但在过去封建统治下，特别是解放前在国民党反动政权的摧残下，这一具有优良传统的民族工艺不仅没有获得发展，反而日趋没落，甚至有些宝贵的生产经验也逐渐失传了，到国民党政权崩溃的前夕，只能生产一些粗糙的日用瓷。直到解放后，奄奄一息的陶瓷工业才走上了枯木逢春的道路。
    几年来，在党的正确领导和政府的积极支持下，祖国的陶瓷工业不但获得了迅速的恢复和发展，而且使这一行业跳出了日用陶瓷和艺术陶瓷生产的范畴，一跃而为祖国的科学和工业建设服务了。例如，国内外过去一向认为必需用钢铁（或不锈钢）制造的提炼植物用的油脂浸出器、制取酒精用的蒸馏塔、动力用的煤气发生炉、造纸机的烘缸、耐酸鼓风机、离心泵以及电动机外壳等等机械设备，已用陶瓷制成并且投入了生产。世界造纸工业的最新技术设备“连续蒸煮器”，也在宜兴鼎蜀镇试制成了。此外还有代替钢材的陶质轨道、陶瓷车床、车床切削刀具、瓷质钻头等等不下千余种。
    用陶瓷代钢铁的经济价值究竟有多大呢？仅以造纸工业为例，目前，一般纸机上的很多钢铁设备都已能用陶瓷制造，如小型圆网及其所需生产设备蒸煮锅、烘缸、悬网架、压榨辊等，都可用陶瓷制造。假设今年生产陶瓷造纸机二千台，即可为国家节省钢铁几万吨。如果拿所有可以用陶瓷代替钢铁的设备来估算，节省的钢铁总量将是一个相当可观的数字。因此，对陶瓷工业在我国经济建设中的作用是必须给予充分的估价的。
    以瓷代钢制造机械设备，不仅有很大的经济价值，而且陶瓷性能和钢铁比较，还有以下优点：
      （1）抗腐蚀性比钢铁好得多。钢铁易氧化生锈，遇酸腐蚀很快。陶瓷不会氧化，对盐酸、硫酸、硝酸的抗酸性都在98％以上，抗碱性也达49％，用陶瓷作食品及化工设备，不但比钢铁耐用得多，如果用作地下的管道，可经许多年不坏。因此用陶瓷作食品工业设备和自来水管及水利用管道更适合。
      （2）比重轻。陶瓷为二点五左右，钢铁是七点六左右。因此，用陶瓷设备比钢铁设备节省安装设备基础的材料。
      （3）传热性为钢铁的三十分之一左右，用陶瓷作低压锅炉，蒸煮罐等还可节省保温材料。
      （4）耐高温性比钢铁强。陶瓷耐温度达到摄氏一千九百度，钢铁在一千一百度至一千五百度，就会变形。
      （5）陶瓷的膨胀率比钢铁小一半，因此不易变形。硬度比钢铁高十到二十倍，唐山瓷厂已用陶瓷作出可代替合金钢刀片用于金属加工业。
    陶瓷虽不能焊接，但能粘接，如用耐酸水泥可粘接陶瓷加热容器，作一般的化工、轻工及食品工业设备没有问题。至于陶瓷有容易击碎的缺点，但用作振动不大，不易碰撞的化工、食品等设备、各种管道及作小型纸厂的造纸机烘缸和蒸煮锅是完全可以的。高级绝缘纸和造纸中技术最复杂的电容器纸的设备也可考虑用陶瓷作，因为陶瓷不易受腐蚀，更适合工艺的要求。
    所以，用陶瓷代替钢铁制造机械设备，不是一个简单的暂时代替钢铁的问题，而是一个符合多、快、好、省建设社会主义的先进的技术革命问题。例如化学工业中必不可少的耐酸反应锅、耐酸鼓风机、耐酸离心泵，电气工业中的绝缘器材等等，都必须以工业用耐酸陶瓷来制造。再如冶金、纺织、卫生、建筑、食品等工业的某些器材和设备也必须用各种性能的化工陶瓷制成。世界最新的尖端科学技术也与它有着异常密切的关系，要制比钢铁熔点高得多的高温设备，除了用特种陶瓷以外，什么东西也无能为力。
    因此，随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，陶瓷工业的发展远景是非常宏伟的。以耐酸陶瓷为例，它就广泛地应用于硫酸、盐酸、硝酸、磷酸、无机盐、肥料、染料、有机酸、炼焦、林木化学、造纸、石油、食品、印刷、纺织、冶金、人造丝、电缆、火药、橡胶、制药等二十多个轻重工业中。这些工业在第二个五年计划期间都将大大跃进一步，这就势必给耐酸陶瓷的发展，带来广阔的前途。仅江苏一个省的化肥工业在第二个五年计划期间，就需要耐酸陶瓷几万吨。再从代替钢铁管道的陶瓷管道需要量来看，仅据五个省份的初步统计，共需要各种管道几千公里之多。在这一新的形势下，给陶瓷工业展示了广阔的发展前途，完全可以预计，在陶瓷工业已经取得胜利的基础上，今年将取得更大的成就。
