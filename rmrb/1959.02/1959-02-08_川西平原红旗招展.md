    Chengdu, February 7th (By Our Own Correspondent) - Spring has brought boundless joy and a greater leap forward to the ever-green Western Sichuan Plain.

    In Shangyou Commune, Huayang County, these past few days, the fields have been bustling before dawn. Braving the cold wind and treading on the morning glow, countless crowds flow continuously. Digging manure pits, shoveling turf, building wall mud... figures flicker in the night sky, and fertilizer heaps are constantly increasing. During the day, red flags flutter under the blue sky, and teams of fertilizer-spreading armies sprint, carrying manure buckets.

    "Do a good job in production to welcome the Spring Festival." Just before the beginning of spring, the commune members decided to completely eliminate 10% of the third-class seedlings in more than 25,000 mu of wheat and rape fields before the Spring Festival, and at the same time, set off a greater upsurge in accumulating and creating fertilizer. In the past two days, everyone in the Shangyou Commune has strived to make contributions to a greater leap forward. The entire commune has more than 17,000 laborers, but the number of people working has exceeded 20,000. Many elderly people, women, and children have been mobilized. Red flag competitions have been launched from the cultivation area to the production team and to individual commune members. In the past two days, dozens of commune members in the Heping cultivation area have been listed on the honor roll. In the past two days, the entire commune has accumulated and created more than 30 million dan of fertilizer, equivalent to more than one-third of the total for the previous month. All third-class seedlings in the entire commune have been top-dressed once and irrigated.

    The tense labor and the joyful atmosphere blend together. Many commune members have already happily cleaned their houses. More than 110 sewing factories (groups) in the entire commune are working day and night to make new clothes for the commune members. Business is booming in rural stores along the bamboo forests and paths. The New Year's food arranged by the commune for the commune members—pork, flour, glutinous rice, and soybeans—has been distributed to the commune members since the beginning of spring.

    川西平原红旗招展
    本报成都7日电　春天，给四季长青的川西平原带来了无比的欢乐，也带来了更大的跃进。
    在华阳县上游公社，这两天，天不亮，田野就沸腾了。迎着寒风，踏着朝霞，数不尽的人群川流不息。挖粪坑，铲草皮，起墙泥……人影在夜空中闪动，肥堆在不断地增高。白天，碧空下红旗招展，一队一队追肥大军，挑着粪桶飞奔。
    “搞好生产迎春节”，就在立春前夕，社员们决心把二万五千多亩小麦和油菜田的10％三类苗，在春节前彻底消灭，同时，掀起更大的积肥造肥热潮。两天来，上游公社人人争取为更大的跃进立功劳。全社有一万七千多个劳动力，但出工人数却超过了两万，许多老年人、妇女和儿童都出动了。从耕作区到生产队，和社员个人都展开了红旗竞赛。和平耕作区两天中就有几十个社员上了红榜。两天来，全社积造肥料三千多万担，相当前一个月总合的三分之一多。全社三类苗都施了一次追肥，灌了水。
    紧张的劳动和欢乐的气氛交融。许多社员，已经喜气洋洋把房屋洗刷一新。全社一百一十多个缝纫厂（组），正日夜为社员们赶制新衣，竹林间，小道旁，农村商店生意兴隆。公社为社员们安排的过年食品——猪肉、面粉、糯米、黄豆，从立春后就已发给社员。
