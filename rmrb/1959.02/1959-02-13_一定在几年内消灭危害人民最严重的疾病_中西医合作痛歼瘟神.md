Xinhua News Agency, 12th. China's traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel, together with the broad masses of the people, are fighting tenaciously against disease demons under the leadership of the Party, scoring successive victories and sending frequent good news. This makes people more convinced that the Party's proposal to eliminate several diseases that most seriously endanger the people within a few years can definitely be achieved.
	Schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, hookworm disease, and kala-azar, diseases which used to plague and kill tens of thousands of people year after year, have now been badly battered. After the Great Leap Forward last year, the number of people suffering from these diseases and the incidence rate have dropped sharply. Of the 324 counties and cities in the twelve provinces along the Yangtze River and in the south where schistosomiasis used to be prevalent, more than 190 counties and cities (accounting for 60% of the endemic areas) have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Under the direct leadership of the Nine-Person Group for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis established by the Party Central Committee, and through the efforts of Chinese and Western medical personnel and the broad masses of the people, large numbers of former patients have recovered their health. 400,000 people were treated nationwide in 1955, 500,000 people were treated in 1957, and 3.6 million people were treated from January to November during the Great Leap Forward last year. In Miaotan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, the "Taoqi Fan" area had 600 mu of paddy fields. In the past, whoever cultivated it would get schistosomiasis due to the large number of snails. Before liberation, eight of the 40 households living there died out, and the rest moved away. Now, schistosomiasis and its vector snail have been eliminated, and people have returned to rebuild their homes. It has now become a prosperous village with 150 households. Malaria is a highly infectious disease with a high incidence rate. At the beginning of liberation, the number of sufferers was estimated to be at least 30 million, prevalent in vast areas of the country. Now, 685 counties and cities have basically eliminated malaria. Some of these counties and cities were areas with severe and perennial epidemics in the past. For example, Simao County in Yunnan Province was formerly famous for its malaria epidemic. From the beginning of the epidemic in 1918, the reactionary government neither prevented it nor treated it seriously for 30 years. By the time of liberation, the population of Simao County had dropped from more than 100,000 to more than 20,000. Now, malaria has been basically eliminated in this county, and the total population of the county has grown to more than 52,000. Lingshui and Baoting counties in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which are located in the subtropics, have always been known as "malarial areas." In the past, the incidence rate of malaria was as high as 92%. Now it has dropped to 1%. In the past, in the rural areas south of the Yangtze River, one could often see farmers dragging themselves with thick and swollen legs, which were the so-called "rubber legs," a late-stage symptom of filariasis. In the past, this chronic infectious disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, was distributed in fourteen provinces south of Henan and Shandong. Now, more than 320,000 patients have been cured, and 22 counties and cities across the country have basically eliminated this disease. Hookworm disease has been basically eliminated in 61 counties and cities. From January to November last year, a total of 25 million patients were treated nationwide. The masses in Yingshan County, Sichuan Province, recently composed a new folk song to describe their enthusiasm after being cured of hookworm disease: "A carrying pole is long, carrying loads heavier than before, in the past could not move carrying the loads, this year legs are stronger; getting rid of hookworms and a strong body, thanks to Chairman Mao, thanks to the Communist Party, ensure a thousand jin of grain this year." Last year, Sichuan Province treated more than 10 million hookworm disease patients. Kala-azar, which had 600,000 patients at the beginning of liberation, has now been basically eliminated nationwide.
	Areas that have erected red flags in the prevention and elimination of these major diseases have summarized their experiences. Although the types of diseases are different and the characteristics of the regions vary, there are several basic experiences that are the same in all regions, namely: resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party, serving production and combining with production, combining technical forces with mass movements, cooperating between Chinese and Western medicine, combining prevention and treatment, and working hard with skill.
	The process of schistosomiasis prevention and control in Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, is a concrete manifestation of these experiences. On the basis of basically eliminating schistosomiasis in the county the year before last, another large-scale annihilation campaign of "fighting hard for 30 days to eliminate snails" was launched in April last year, and thus, schistosomiasis, which had been prevalent for more than a hundred years, was completely eradicated. When the medical staff launched schistosomiasis prevention and control work in this county in 1953, they regarded this work as purely a medical technical matter, and "fought alone," and the work did not go well. Later, the CPC County Committee discovered this situation and immediately put schistosomiasis prevention and control work on the Party's agenda, formulated the principle of "prevention and control work must be combined with the development of production," and proposed an advanced plan to "clear up in two years." Under the collective leadership of the County Committee, organizational structures were established from top to bottom, and special personnel were designated at all levels. Each district, township, town, farm, and agricultural cooperative established a three-person team led by the Party, and specific tasks were stipulated. In this way, with the strong leadership of the Party, clear direction, specific requirements, and timely task deployment, "schistosomiasis prevention" work was no longer just a solo battle by professional personnel, but became a mass movement combining technical forces and the masses under the leadership of the Party. According to the specific conditions of the epidemic area, the County Committee also formulated an overall plan that organically combines production and epidemic prevention. "Schistosomiasis prevention" work arranges different prevention and control tasks according to the production characteristics of each season, combining large-scale assault movements with regular and meticulous work. For example, they carried out large-scale snail elimination movements in winter in conjunction with water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation; in spring, in conjunction with fertilizer delivery and fertilizer production, they carried out manure fermentation to kill insect eggs; during summer harvesting and summer planting, autumn harvesting and autumn planting, and weeding, they carried out snail elimination and egg killing in the fields; in terms of treatment work, a large number of people with strong labor forces were treated during slack farming seasons, and women, children, and severely ill patients were treated during busy farming seasons; medical forces were decentralized, going deep into grassroots production units and families for on-site treatment, and medical personnel participated in production while treating diseases. In this way, production was developed, patients were treated, and snails were eliminated, and a miracle that had been dreamed of for many years appeared.
	Traditional Chinese medicine personnel are a huge medical and disease prevention force. In order to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in disease prevention and control, the principle of unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine must be implemented in terms of technical strength. In the work of preventing and controlling several major diseases, both Chinese and Western medical personnel have played important roles. The combination of Chinese and Western medicine not only solves the problem of technical strength, but experience has also proved that for many diseases, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine treatment methods can complement each other's strengths and achieve greater prevention and control effects. For example, for late-stage schistosomiasis, using antimony agents alone for treatment is prone to accidents, but first using traditional Chinese medicine to regulate and nourish the body and improve physical fitness, and then using antimony agents for treatment, is both safe and effective. Acupuncture and moxibustion are also effective in preventing and suppressing adverse reactions caused by antimony agents. *Veratrum nigrum*, a traditional Chinese medicine, is effective for schistosomiasis. Experiments have shown that it can kill adult schistosomiasis worms in the human body, but it is toxic to the human body. After research by Western medicine workers in Anhui and other places, they have initially found ways to extract the effective components and eliminate toxic substances. In the past two years, 100,000 schistosomiasis patients have been treated by Chinese and Western medicine cooperation nationwide, of which 90% of the patients have recovered their health. In recent years, many effective Chinese and Western methods for preventing and treating diseases have been continuously discovered and created. In the fight to eliminate major diseases, both Chinese and Western methods are used simultaneously; adapting to people, places, and diseases, and choosing the most suitable method to prevent and control is also one of the main factors for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    一定在几年内消灭危害人民最严重的疾病
    中西医合作痛歼瘟神
    新华社12日讯　我国中西医务人员和广大人民一起，在党的领导下向病魔进行顽强斗争中节节胜利，捷报频传。这使人们更加深信党提出的在几年之内消灭危害人民最严重的几种疾病，是一定可以做到的。
    数年以前还是常年累月地戕害着成千上万人民的血吸虫病、疟疾、丝虫病、钩虫病和黑热病这些瘟神，如今已经被打得遍体疮痍。经过去年的大跃进，这些疾病的患病人数和发病率都在急骤地下降。血吸虫病曾经流行过的长江两岸及南方的十二个省区的三百二十四个县市，现在已有一百九十多个县市（占流行地区的60％）基本上消灭了血吸虫病。在党中央成立的防治血吸虫病九人小组的直接领导下，经过中西医务人员和广大群众的努力，原有病人成批地恢复了健康。1955年全国治疗了四十万人，1957年治疗了五十万人，去年大跃进中，从1月到11月，治疗了三百六十万人。湖北谷城县庙滩乡的“淘气畈”，原有六百亩水田，往年由于钉螺多，谁种谁得血吸虫病，解放前四十户居民中死绝了八户，其余都迁走了。现在消灭了血吸虫病和它的媒介——钉螺，人们回来重建家园，已成为有一百五十户居民的繁荣乡村了。疟疾是发病率极高的传染病，解放初期的患病人数估计至少有三千万人，流行在全国广大地区。现在已有六百八十五个县市基本上消灭了疟疾。这些县市中有的是过去连年严重流行的高疟地区。例如云南省思茅县过去以疟疾流行著名。从1918年流行开始，在三十年间，反动政府既不加以预防，也没有认真治疗。到解放的时候，思茅县的人口已从三十多年前的十万多降到二万多。现在这个县的疟疾已经基本消灭，全县人口已发展到五万二千多。处于亚热带的海南黎族苗族自治州的陵水、保亭两县，历来被称为“瘴疠之区”，过去疟疾发病率高达92％。现在已下降到1％。过去在长江以南的农村里，常常可以看到农民蹒跚地拖着一双又粗又肿的腿，这便是所谓“橡皮腿”，是丝虫病的晚期症状。过去这种由蚊虫媒介的慢性传染病分布在河南、山东以南的十四个省份，现在已经治好了三十二万多病人；全国已有二十二个县市已经基本上消灭了这种疾病。钩虫病已经在六十一个县市基本消灭。去年1月到11月全国共治疗了二千五百万患者。四川省营山县群众最近编了一首新山歌来形容治愈钩虫病以后的干劲：“一条扁担长又长，挑起担子比往常，往年挑担走不动，今年腿上加了钢；打掉钩虫身体壮，感谢毛主席，感谢共产党，保证今年完成千斤粮”。去年，四川省治疗了一千多万个钩虫病患者。解放初期有六十万患者的黑热病，现在在全国范围内已经基本上消灭。
    在防治和消灭这些主要疾病方面插了红旗的地区，纷纷总结了他们的经验。尽管疾病种类不同、地区特点各异，但是有几条基本经验是各地相同，这就是：坚决依靠党的领导，为生产服务、同生产结合，技术力量和群众运动结合，中西医合作，防治并举，苦干加上巧干。
    江西省余江县防治血吸虫病的过程就是这些经验的具体体现。这个县在前年基本消灭了血吸虫病的基础上，去年4月又乘胜开展了一场“苦战三十天灭螺”的大规模扫荡战，至此，流行了百余年的血吸虫病根本铲除。这个县在1953年开展血吸虫病防治工作的时候，医务人员把这项工作看成只是一件纯属医务技术的事，“孤军作战”，工作开展不好。后来中共县委发现了这个情况，立即把防治血吸虫病工作提上党的议事日程，制定了“防治工作必须与发展生产相结合”的原则，提出了“两年扫清”的先进计划。在县委的集体领导下，自上而下地建立了组织机构，层层指定专人负责。各区、乡、镇、农场和农业社都建立了由党领导的三人小组；都规定了具体任务。这样一来，有了党的坚强领导，方针明确、要求具体、任务布置及时，  “血防”工作就不单是专业人员孤军作战，而成了党领导下的技术力量与群众相结合的群众运动。县委根据疫区具体情况，又制订了生产和防疫有机结合的通盘计划。“血防”工作根据各季节的生产特点，布置了不同防治任务，使大规模的突击运动与经常性的细致工作结合起来，例如他们在冬季结合兴修水利和积肥开展大规模灭钉螺运动；春季结合送肥造肥，进行粪便发酵杀虫卵；夏收夏种、秋收秋种和耘田时，结合进行田间灭螺和杀卵，在治疗工作上，农闲时期大量治疗劳动力强的人，农忙期间治疗妇女小孩和重病人；医务力量化整为零，深入基层生产单位和家庭就地治疗，医务人员一边参加生产一边治疗疾病。这样，生产得到了发展，病人得到了治疗，钉螺也被消灭，出现了多少年来梦想不到的奇迹。
    中医人员是一股庞大的医防力量。在防治疾病中，要取得多快好省的成就，在技术力量上必须贯彻中西医团结、合作的方针。在防治几种主要疾病的工作中，中西医务人员都发挥了重要作用。中西结合不仅解决了技术力量的问题，经验证明对于不少疾病采用中西医方法结合治疗，可以取长补短，发挥更大的防治效果。例如对晚期血吸虫病，单纯使用锑剂治疗容易发生意外，但先用中医投药调理补养，改善体质，然后再用锑剂治疗，既安全又有疗效。对锑剂引起的不良反应，采用针灸预防和抑止也有一定效果。中药藜芦对血吸虫病有效，经试验能杀死人体内血吸虫成虫，但对人体有毒性，经安徽等地西医工作者的研究，已初步找出了提取其中有效成分和排除有毒物质的办法。近两年来，全国中西医合作治疗的血吸虫病患者有十万人，其中90％的病人已恢复了健康。近年来不断发掘和创造了许多防治疾病有效的中西方法。在消灭主要疾病的斗争中，中西方法双管齐下；因人因地因病制宜，在多种方法中选择最适合的方法来防治，也是取得多快好省的成绩的主要因素之一。（附图片）
