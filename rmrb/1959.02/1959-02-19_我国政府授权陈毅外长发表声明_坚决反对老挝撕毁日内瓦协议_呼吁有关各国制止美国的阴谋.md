Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Foreign Minister Chen Yi of the People’s Republic of China issues a statement regarding the Lao Kingdom Government’s refusal to continue implementing the Geneva Accords:
                                            February 18, 1959
    Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom Government, Phoui Sananikone, issued a statement on February 11, claiming that the Lao Kingdom had completed its responsibility to implement the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and other agreements signed at the Geneva Conference by the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union forces on behalf of the Lao Kingdom Government. Therefore, the Kingdom Government would no longer be bound by the Geneva Accords and opposed the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, declaring that the Lao Kingdom does not recognize the arbitration of any international organization outside the United Nations. Prime Minister Sananikone's statement is a serious act of brazenly undermining the Geneva Accords and is also part of the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression against Indochina. As soon as Prime Minister Sananikone's statement was issued, a U.S. State Department spokesman immediately stated on February 12 that the United States supported the Lao government's action in deeming the 1954 Geneva Accords no longer applicable. U.S. State Department officials also believed that the United States was now free to establish a military mission in Laos. This shows that the Lao Kingdom Government's open refusal to continue to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations under the Geneva Accords is due to U.S. instigation and support, and the U.S.'s purpose is to further drag the Lao Kingdom into the Manila Pact and turn Laos into a U.S. military base.

    It is worth noting that even before this, the U.S. government had already shipped large quantities of weapons into Laos and sent a large number of Filipino U.S. Air Force personnel to Laos. The Lao Kingdom Government also sent a delegation to participate in the U.S.-Thai military exercises held in northern Thailand from February 3 to 6. Lao Army Chief of Staff, Ratthikoun, openly declared that Laos was within the "defense" scope of the Manila military bloc. This series of serious events that violate the Geneva Accords shows that U.S. military intervention in Laos is intensifying. This once again proves that the Geneva Accords have not only not been fully implemented in Laos, but have also been subjected to the most blatant violations.

    Under these circumstances, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos has even more reason to continue to carry out its mission. All activities of the Lao International Commission are aimed at monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, which does not constitute interference in Laos' internal affairs at all. Facts have proved that the continued existence and activities of the Lao International Commission are beneficial to peace in Indochina, to the national independence of Laos, and to peaceful reunification within the country. If there is any disadvantage, it is only disadvantageous to the U.S.'s military intervention in and infiltration of Laos.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China agrees with and supports the opinions and suggestions put forward by the two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, in their letters to the Indian government and to the Lao International Commission on January 31, 1959, hoping that the Lao International Commission will resume its activities in Laos to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and to safeguard peace in Indochina.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China authorizes me to solemnly declare: China is a participating country in the Geneva Conference and a neighbor of Laos. It cannot but express serious concern over the U.S.'s blatant instigation and support of the Lao Kingdom Government in renouncing the Geneva Accords, creating tension in Laos, and undermining peace in the Indochina region. The Lao Kingdom Government is fully bound by the Geneva Accords and has the responsibility and obligation to earnestly and completely implement the decisions of the Geneva Conference on the Lao issue. The Chinese government firmly opposes the Lao Kingdom Government's unilateral act of tearing up the Geneva Accords. The Lao Kingdom Government must bear all the consequences arising therefrom. The 1954 Geneva Conference and the agreements reached therein have no connection with the United Nations whatsoever. The U.S. conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords and to carry out military intervention in Laos is absolutely impermissible.

    In view of the seriousness of the situation in Laos, the Government of the People's Republic of China calls on the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, first and foremost the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom as Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, as well as the member states of the Indochina International Commission and all countries and peoples concerned with and safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia, to rise up and resolutely oppose and stop the U.S.'s conspiracy to instigate the Lao Kingdom Government to renounce the Geneva Accords, so that the Lao International Commission can continue its activities, the tense situation in Laos can be eased, and peace in the Indochina region can be maintained and consolidated.

### 我国政府授权陈毅外长发表声明  坚决反对老挝撕毁日内瓦协议  呼吁有关各国制止美国的阴谋

    我国政府授权陈毅外长发表声明
    坚决反对老挝撕毁日内瓦协议
    呼吁有关各国制止美国的阴谋
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅关于老挝王国政府拒绝继续履行日内瓦协议的声明
                                            1959年2月18日
    老挝王国政府培·萨纳尼空首相2月11日发表声明，认为老挝王国已经完成履行停止敌对行动协定和法兰西联邦部队总司令部代替老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议上签订的其它各项协定的责任，因此王国政府将不再受日内瓦协议的约束，并且反对老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动，声言老挝王国不承认联合国之外的任何国际组织的仲裁。萨纳尼空首相的这一声明，是悍然破坏日内瓦协议的严重行为，也是美国帝国主义对印度支那的侵略阴谋的一部分。当萨纳尼空首相的声明刚一发表，美国国务院发言人立即于2月12日表示，美国支持老挝政府所采取的、认为1954年的日内瓦协定不再适用的这一行动。美国国务院官员还认为，美国现在可以自由地在老挝设立一个军事使团了。这就表明，老挝王国政府公开拒绝继续履行它所承担的日内瓦协议的责任和义务，是由于美国的指使和支持，而美国的目的正是要进一步把老挝王国拉入马尼拉侵略集团，变老挝为美国的军事基地。
    值得注意的是，还在这以前，美国政府就已经以大量武器运入老挝，并派遣了大批菲籍美国空军人员到老挝。老挝王国政府也派代表团参加了2月3日至6日在泰国北部举行的美泰军事演习。老挝陆军参谋长拉提曲耳曾公然声明，老挝是在马尼拉军事集团“防御”范围之内。这一系列违反日内瓦协议的严重事件，说明美国对老挝进行的军事干涉正在加紧。这也就再一次证明日内瓦协议在老挝不仅没有得到完全的履行，而且还遭受到最粗暴的破坏。
    在这种情况下，老挝国际监察和监督委员会就更有必要继续执行它的任务。老挝国际委员会的全部活动都是为了监察和监督日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，这对老挝根本不发生什么干涉内政的问题。事实证明，老挝国际委员会的继续存在和活动，对于印度支那的和平，对于老挝的国家独立和国内的和平统一都是有利的。如果说有所不利的话，那只是不利于美国对老挝的军事干涉和向老挝的渗入。
    中华人民共和国政府同意和支持日内瓦会议两位主席，苏联和英国，在1959年1月31日给印度政府和给老挝国际委员会的信中所提出的意见和建议，希望老挝国际委员会恢复它在老挝的活动，以保证日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，维护印度支那的和平。
    中华人民共和国政府授权本人郑重声明：中国是日内瓦会议的参加国，又是老挝的邻邦，它对于美国公然策动和支持老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议，在老挝制造紧张局势，破坏印度支那地区的和平，不能不表示严重的关切。老挝王国政府完全受日内瓦协议的约束，它有责任和义务严肃而完满地履行日内瓦会议有关老挝问题的各项决定。中国政府坚决反对老挝王国政府片面撕毁日内瓦协议的行为。老挝王国政府必须承担由此引起的一切后果。1954年的日内瓦会议及其所达成的协议，同联合国没有丝毫关系。美国破坏日内瓦协议和对老挝进行军事干涉的阴谋是绝对不能容许的。
    鉴于老挝局势的严重性，中华人民共和国政府呼吁日内瓦会议与会国家，首先是作为日内瓦会议主席的苏联和英国，以及参加印度支那国际委员会的成员国和一切关心和维护东南亚和平的国家和人民，大家起来坚决反对和制止美国策动老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议的阴谋，使老挝国际委员会能够继续活动，使老挝的紧张局势得以和缓，使印度支那地区的和平得以保持和巩固。
