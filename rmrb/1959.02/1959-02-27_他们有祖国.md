They Have a Motherland
Wan Feng

Following the statement issued by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on December 30, 1958, regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, Premier Kim Il-sung stated on January 10 this year, during a meeting with Masaharu Hatanaka, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Association, that the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan is their legitimate right and should not be infringed upon by anyone, and that the Republic's government has made preparations for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. This has once again strongly ignited the hope of hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan who long to return to their motherland. Korean residents living in various parts of Japan eagerly await the day they can return to the free and independent motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—and join the people of the motherland in socialist construction.

The Consequences of Colonial Servitude

Currently, according to Japanese press reports, there are more than 600,000 Korean residents living in various parts of Japan. Although their length of residence in Japan varies, almost none of them voluntarily settled in Japan. With the exception of a very few, they were all forced to go to Japan by Japanese militarists and zaibatsu during the period of 1910-1945, when Korea was a Japanese colony.

After Japan occupied Korea in 1910, it unscrupulously plundered Korea's resources and enslaved the Korean people like cattle. During World War I from 1914 to 1918, Japanese zaibatsu, in order to solve the shortage of domestic labor and maintain a low-wage policy, began to coerce large numbers of Korean people to work in Japan. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the number of Korean residents forced to go to Japan by Japanese imperialism, including famine refugees, increased even more. By 1938, the cumulative number of Korean residents in Japan had reached 800,000.

However, the vast majority of Korean residents in Japan today were forced to live in Japan during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War due to the conscription of Japanese imperialism. From 1939 onwards, the vicious Japanese militarists and zaibatsu, under the guise of "Labor Mobilization Plans" and "National General Mobilization Plans," constantly abducted large numbers of Korean people to Japan. Some of them were sent to the front lines as cannon fodder, and others worked as laborers in so-called wartime industries like slaves. According to statistics from the Police Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of Koreans forcibly relocated to Japan due to labor conscription and military conscription was 960,000 in 1939, 1.47 million in 1941, and more than 1.93 million in 1944. During the Pacific War alone, nearly one million Korean laborers worked in so-called wartime industries, and approximately 370,000 Koreans in Japan were conscripted into the army and navy. By the end of the war in 1945, the total number of Korean residents in Japan was close to two million.

After Korea was liberated in 1945, most of the Korean residents returned to their homeland one after another, leaving 600,000 who had not been able to return home for various reasons.

Living in Deep Water and Scorching Fire

The lives of Korean residents in Japan are a history of hardship and tears. Japanese imperialism owes them a huge blood debt. According to the reduced statistics of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1955, nearly 20,000 Koreans conscripted into the military and abducted to Japan during the Pacific War died, and nearly 10,000 Korean laborers in Japan died due to mistreatment.

Not only that, but since the end of the war, the Japanese reactionaries have continued to adopt an imperialist colonial oppression attitude towards Korean residents in Japan. The Japanese government has deprived them of all political freedoms and rights to life that they should enjoy as foreigners. From clothing, food, housing, and transportation to culture and education, they suffer unwarranted discrimination and cruel oppression in all aspects. Their social status and living conditions are even worse than those of the Burakumin, who are still discriminated against in Japanese society.

Due to the discrimination of the Japanese government, 80% of Korean residents in Japan are currently unemployed, and they have completely fallen into a state of unemployment and underemployment. Among the so-called "employed" Korean residents, with the exception of a very few wealthy households who own individual businesses, the vast majority can only make a living by running small handicrafts, small restaurants, and scrap metal shops, but the Japanese government also uses methods such as depriving them of mining rights, ship ownership, and refusing loans to strangle their livelihoods.

Most Korean residents in Japan can only make a living by picking up garbage, doing odd jobs, and subcontracting some bad jobs from small businesses. Most of their families, young and old, are busy from morning to night, but it is difficult to get even a full meal. Taking Hiroshima Prefecture as an example, only one-tenth of the 3,500 Korean households in the prefecture can barely make ends meet. Eating rice with soy sauce and salt is a common phenomenon in the lives of Korean residents in Hiroshima Prefecture. Many people suffering from severe tuberculosis due to fatigue and malnutrition are unable to seek medical treatment and have to "leave it to fate." Many people starve to death or sell themselves into prostitution or commit suicide due to financial difficulties.

The Japanese government not only tries every means to block the path to survival for Korean residents in Japan, but also levies blood and sweat taxes on these impoverished Korean residents. According to a report in the December 1958 issue of the Japanese magazine "Chuo Koron," the Japanese government collected 13 billion yen in taxes from Koreans in 1957, and it is said that it increased to about 20 billion in 1958.

Korean residents in Japan are also discriminated against and oppressed in culture and education. Among the 150,000 young people, more than 127,000 cannot enjoy the right to democratic national education. Even if some can go to school, it is extremely difficult to enter Japanese universities for higher education. Even if a few individuals are lucky enough to go to university, they will be unemployed upon graduation, and their future is bleak.

The Japanese government also persecutes Korean residents in Japan by means of investigating "smuggling" and fabricating espionage cases. Korean residents detained in the Omura Detention Center in Kyushu and the Hamamatsu Detention Center in Shizuoka Prefecture have been illegally detained by the Japanese government for an average of more than three years.

The Struggle for Repatriation

Unwilling to succumb to humiliation and oppression, Korean residents in Japan have been fighting unyieldingly for more than a decade under the leadership of the Korean Residents Union in Japan (1945-1949) and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (established in 1951) to win legitimate rights as foreigners and freedom to return to their homeland. The thriving development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has further encouraged their fighting spirit.

"Get out of the cage and return to the independent and free motherland!" has become their resounding slogan.

After the war, the Japanese government not only ignored the legitimate demands of Korean residents to return to their homeland, but also colluded with the Syngman Rhee clique to send thousands of Korean residents to South Korea to suffer. After Nobusuke Kishi came to power in early 1957, activities to obstruct and undermine the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan have not stopped. However, the will of Korean residents in Japan to return to their motherland is unstoppable. As of January 29 this year, 117,000 people have applied to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is estimated that more than 300,000 people currently hope to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The struggle of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland has also received sympathy and support from public opinion at home and abroad. The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and the Japan-Korea Association, as well as the broad masses of the Japanese people, have been strongly supporting them in various ways. By the end of last year, 178 local assemblies and local administrative chiefs' conferences in Japan had passed resolutions demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government take concrete measures on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to assist the Japanese Red Cross in the work of repatriating Korean residents in Japan.

Under pressure from public opinion at home and abroad, coupled with the development of conflicts between Japan and South Korea, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting on January 30 this year that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is discussing with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Japanese Red Cross how to send Korean residents back to North Korea. He also stated that the issue of sending Korean residents back to North Korea is a humanitarian issue. Subsequently, on February 13, the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet meeting decided to agree to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to North Korea.

However, Syngman Rhee, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, threatened and intimidated the Japanese government in every possible way in order to undermine the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. On February 12, the Syngman Rhee clique detained the Japanese freighter "Tohai Maru" in Busan. On February 13, Ryu Tae-ha, the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique stationed in Japan, went to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a strong "protest" to the Japanese government, threatening to suspend "Japan-South Korea negotiations" and sever all relations between Japan and South Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique even went so far as to adopt a thug-like posture, threatening to "stop the implementation of Japan's Korean repatriation plan at any cost," and created an anti-Japanese "fever" in South Korea. At the same time, the US imperialism, the master of the Syngman Rhee clique, tried its best to ask the Japanese government to take a "moderate" approach and reach a compromise with the Syngman Rhee clique through its embassy in Tokyo. US imperialism is carrying out covert interference conspiracies, making the issue more complicated. Recently, news has come out that Nobusuke Kishi has privately promised the Syngman Rhee clique that he will not make a decision on the Korean repatriation plan for the time being. Under this situation, the Nobusuke Kishi government decided on February 18 to request the International Committee of the Red Cross, together with the Japanese Red Cross, to "identify" Korean residents in Japan who wish to return home, which is obviously a trick to obstruct and undermine the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. The Korean Red Cross and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan condemned this conspiracy to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents.

Hundreds of thousands of Korean residents united around the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan are demanding through struggle that the Nobusuke Kishi government fulfill its promise and take concrete measures to repatriate Korean residents in Japan, and oppose all words and deeds that are unfavorable to this issue. Currently, a large-scale movement to remove obstacles to the repatriation of Koreans is vigorously underway. (Attached pictures)

Korean residents spread out along the streets to launch a signature campaign demanding repatriation to their homeland.

    他们有祖国
    万峰
    继1958年12月30日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日就旅日朝侨回国问题发表声明之后，今年1月10日金日成首相在接见日朝协会理事长畑中政春时说，旅日朝侨归国是他们正当的权利，任何人不得侵犯，共和国政府已经为旅日朝侨归国做好了准备。这再一次强烈地激发了几十万旅日朝侨渴望重返祖国的希望。旅居日本各地的朝鲜侨民，殷切地盼望早日回到自由独立的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，和祖国人民一道投身于社会主义建设中。
    殖民奴役的后果
    现在，旅居日本各地的朝鲜侨民据日本报刊统计，总计达六十多万人。尽管他们在日本的居住时间有久暂，然而几乎没有一个人是自愿到日本定居的。他们当中除极个别者外，都是在1910—1945年朝鲜沦为日本殖民地这段历史时期内，在日本军阀和财阀的逼迫、掳掠下到日本去的。
    日本帝国主义在1910年侵占朝鲜以后，一面肆无忌惮地掠夺朝鲜的资源，一面把朝鲜人民像牛马一般地加以奴役。在1914—1918年第一次世界大战中，日本财阀为了解决国内劳动力不足和维持低工资政策，开始大批胁迫朝鲜人民去日本作工。1931年“九一八”事变后，连逃荒难民在内被日本帝国主义逼迫赴日的朝鲜侨民更有增无已，到1938年旅日朝侨累计已达八十万人。
    但是，现在旅日朝侨中绝大多数人是在日本侵华战争和太平洋战争时期因日本帝国主义拉伕而被迫流落在日本的。穷凶极恶的日本军阀和财阀从1939年起在“劳务动员计划”、“国民总动员计划”等名目下，不断地把大批朝鲜人民掳到日本去。他们有的人被当作炮灰送上前线，有的像奴隶一般在所谓战时产业中当劳工。据日本内务省警保局的统计，因抓劳工和征兵而被强制迁到日本去的朝鲜人，1939年为九十六万人，1941年为一百四十七万人，1944年为一百九十三万多人。仅太平洋战争时期，在所谓战时产业中工作的朝鲜劳工就已近百万人，而被征入陆海军部队的在日朝鲜人大约有三十七万人。到1945年战争结束时，旅日朝侨总数已近二百万人。
    1945年朝鲜获得解放后，大多数朝侨都陆续回国了，余下的六十万人由于各种原因一时还没能来得及回国。
    水深火热
    旅日朝鲜侨民的生活，是一部辛酸的血泪史。日本帝国主义对他们欠下了一笔巨大的血债。据1955年日本政府厚生省缩小了的统计数字，光是在太平洋战争时期因征兵而被掳到日本来的朝鲜人死亡的近二万人，在日本的朝鲜劳工由于遭受虐待而死亡的也有近万人。
    不仅如此。战后以来，日本反动派对旅日朝侨仍然采取了帝国主义殖民压迫的态度。日本政府剥夺了他们作为外侨应享受的一切政治
  自由和生活权利。从衣食住行到文化教育，他们在各方面都备受无端的歧视和残酷的压迫。他们的社会地位和生活状况，甚至还赶不上日本社会中至今遭到歧视的部落贱民。
    由于日本政府的歧视，现在旅日朝侨中有80％没有职业，他们已完全陷于失业和半失业状态。所谓“有职业的”的朝侨中，除了极个别拥有个人企业的富裕户外，绝大多数无非是靠经营小手艺、小饮食店和废铁铺的生意糊口，然而日本政府也用剥夺矿山所有权、船舶所有权及不放贷款等手段来绞杀他们的生路。
    旅日朝侨的大多数人只能靠拾垃圾、打零工以及从小企业中包领些烂活计过日子。他们大多全家老小从早忙到晚，可是连一顿饱饭都难弄到。以广岛县为例，全县三千五百户朝侨中，马虎过得下去的只有十分之一。以酱油和盐下饭，几乎是广岛县朝侨普遍的生活现象。很多因劳累和营养失调而患严重肺结核病的人，无力就医，只好“听天由命”。饿死和因生活困难而卖身妓院或自杀的人相当多。
    日本政府不仅千方百计地堵塞旅日朝侨的求生之道，而且还向如此贫困的朝侨征收血汗税金。据1958年12月号日本“中央公论”杂志报道，1957年日本政府向朝鲜人征收的税金达一百三十亿日元，据说1958年增加到约二百亿。
    旅日朝侨在文化教育上也是受歧视和压迫的。在十五万青少年之中，有十二万七千多人不能享受民主的民族教育权利，即使有的能够上学读书，要升入日本大学受高等教育是万分困难的。即使个别人幸运升学，也是毕业即失业，前途渺茫。
    日本政府还以缉查“走私”和捏造间谍案件种种卑鄙手段迫害旅日朝侨。被扣留在九州大村收容所和静冈县滨松收容所的朝侨，每人已经平均被日本政府非法拘留三年以上。
    争取回国的斗争
    不甘于屈辱和压迫的旅日朝侨，十几年来一直在旅日朝鲜人联盟（1945—1949年）和旅日朝鲜人总联合会（1951年成立）的领导下，为争取外侨合法权利和返回祖国的自由而进行了不屈不挠的斗争。祖国朝鲜民主主义人民共和国欣欣向荣的发展，更加鼓舞着他们的斗志。
  “走出牢笼，返回独立自由的祖国！”已经成了他们响亮的行动口号。
    战后日本政府不但漠视朝侨返回祖国的正当要求，并且同李承晚集团勾结，把数以千计的朝侨送到南朝鲜去受罪。1957年初岸信介上台后，阻挠和破坏旅日朝侨回国的活动仍然没有停止。然而旅日朝侨争取重返祖国的意志是不可遏止的。到今年1月29日止，已经有十一万七千人要求回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国去。据估计，目前希望返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人在三十万以上。旅日朝侨争取回国的斗争，还得到了国内外舆论的同情和支持。日本共产党、社会党、“总评”及日朝协会等团体和广大日本人民，一直通过各种方式在大力地支援他们。截至去年年底，日本已有一百七十八个地方议会和地方行政长官会议通过决议，要求岸信介政府对旅日朝侨返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国问题采取具体措施。苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会已经向日本红十字会表示愿意协助遣送旅日朝侨的工作。
    迫于国内外舆论的压力，加上日李矛盾的发展，岸信介内阁外务相藤山爱一郎于今年1月30日的内阁会议后，在记者招待会上说，日本外务省正与厚生省和日本红十字会商量如何进行把朝鲜侨民送回朝鲜北部的工作。他并且表示：把朝鲜侨民送回朝鲜北部的问题是一个有关人道的问题。接着在2月13日岸信介内阁会议决定同意日本外务省对旅日朝侨返回朝鲜北部问题所采取的方针。
    但是，朝鲜人民的死敌李承晚为了破坏旅日朝侨返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的活动，百般地威胁和恫吓日本政府。2月12日李承晚集团在釜山扣留了日本的货轮“东海丸”。2月13日李承晚集团驻日代表柳泰夏去日本外务省，向日本政府提出了强硬“抗议”，并以停止“日韩谈判”和断绝日李间一切关系相威胁。李承晚集团并且不惜摆出打手的架势，扬言“不惜任何代价”制止日本遣送朝侨计划的实现，还在南朝鲜制造了一个反日的“热潮”。同时，李承晚集团的主子美帝国主义，通过它驻东京的大使馆竭力要求日本政府采取“温和”的做法，同李承晚集团取得妥协。美帝国主义在暗中进行干涉阴谋，使问题更加复杂化。最近有消息说，岸信介已私下答应李承晚集团暂不对遣送朝侨的计划作出决定。在这种情况下，岸信介政府于2月18日决定和日本红十字会一起要求红十字会国际委员会对希望回国的旅日朝侨进行“甄别”，这显然是一种企图阻挠和破坏旅日朝侨回国的手法。朝鲜红十字会和旅日朝鲜人总联合会，谴责了这种阻挠朝侨回国的阴谋。
    团结在旅日朝鲜人总联合会周围的几十万朝鲜侨民，正在通过斗争要求岸信介政府实现诺言，作出遣送旅日朝侨回国的具体措施，并且反对它一切不利于这个问题的言行。目前一个争取排除对朝鲜人回国的障碍的大规模运动，正在蓬勃地开展中。（附图片）
