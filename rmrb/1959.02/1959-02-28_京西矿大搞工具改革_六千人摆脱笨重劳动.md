Jingxi Mining Bureau Carries Out Tool Reform
Six Thousand People Escape Heavy Labor

    (Our dispatch) A mass movement centered on technological revolution to eliminate heavy manual labor is unfolding comprehensively at the Jingxi Mining Bureau.
    Beginning in early November of last year, the Jingxi Mining Bureau launched a technological revolution movement centered on mechanization. After fifty days of hard and skillful work, it achieved brilliant results. Of the original 374 heavy manual labor tasks in the bureau's mines and factories, employing 7,564 workers, 309 tasks were mechanized or semi-mechanized through the technological revolution movement, accounting for more than 82% of the original tasks. Six thousand two hundred and twenty-three workers were freed from heavy manual labor, accounting for more than 82% of the original workforce. Due to the greatly increased level of mechanization, the bureau saved 2,539 laborers (including women replacing men), forming twenty new production teams to directly participate in coal mining. This not only alleviated the labor shortage but will also play a significant role in overfulfilling the 1959 leap forward plan.
    Extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses is the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements of this movement. In the early stages of the movement, some people had various concerns about technological innovation. Later, through airing of views, debates, organizing visits, holding on-site meetings, and skills competitions, many specific ideological problems were resolved. For example, the cadres of Anjiatan initially lacked confidence. After visiting the Chengzi Mine, they said, "Our conditions are no worse than those of the Chengzi Mine. Why can they do it, and we can't?" Subsequently, a mass movement of "self-reliance," "self-made, self-used, and self-arming," and vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization was launched comprehensively.
    Clear goals and concentrated firepower are one of the characteristics of this mass movement. In the past, Jingxi also carried out several mechanization movements, but the goals were not clear enough. This time, it was explicitly proposed to mainly eliminate heavy manual labor. Based on the characteristics of coal mines, heavy labor was compiled into ten aspects: "pushing, carrying, shoveling, shouldering, lifting, hugging, digging, swinging, smashing, and carrying," calling on employees to concentrate their firepower and encircle and suppress these ten aspects, thus achieving significant results in a short period.
    This movement also further embodies the principle of combining leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers' masses under the leadership of the Party. For example, the successful trial production of electric motors by the Party Branch Secretary and Mechanical and Electrical Section Chief Liu Qinghai of the Mechanical and Electrical Workshop of the Infrastructure Engineering Department, together with technicians and workers, is a good example of this combination.
    Due to the rapid development of the movement, the quality of some machinery and equipment is not high enough and needs further improvement. Currently, the mines and factories under the Jingxi Mining Bureau are taking measures to consolidate the existing achievements and further carry out the technological revolution movement centered on a large-scale bumper harvest.

    京西矿大搞工具改革
    六千人摆脱笨重劳动
    本报讯　一个以技术革命为中心消灭笨重体力劳动的群众运动，正在京西矿务局全面展开。
    去年11月初，京西矿务局开展了以机械化为中心的技术革命运动，经过五十天的苦干巧干，获得了辉煌的战果。全局各矿、厂原有笨重体力劳动三百七十四项，从事这些劳动的工人七千五百六十四人，通过技术革命运动，有三百零九项实现机械化或半机械化，占原有项目的82％以上。有六千二百二十三名工人摆脱了笨重体力劳动，占原有人数的82％以上。由于机械化程度大大提高，全局节省了二千五百三十九名劳动力（包括以女代男）组成二十个新的生产小组直接参加采煤。这样，不但缓和了劳动力紧张局面，并且对于超额完成1959年的跃进计划将起重大的作用。
    广泛地深入地发动群众，是这次运动取得巨大成就的根本保证。运动初期，有的人对于革新技术有着各种顾虑，后来，经过鸣放辩论、组织参观、召开现场会、比武会，解决了许多具体的思想问题。如安家滩的干部最初信心不足，去城子矿参观以后，他们说：“咱们的条件不比城子矿差，为什么人家能搞咱们不能搞？”接着，一个“自力更生”“自制自用，自己武装自己”的大搞机械化半机械化的群众运动，就全面展开了。
    目标明确，火力集中，是这次群众运动的特点之一。过去京西也搞过几次机械化运动，但目标不够明确。这次，明确地提出主要是消灭笨重体力劳动，根据煤矿特点，将笨重劳动编成“推、抬、攉、背、扛、抱、挖、抡、砸、端”十个方面，号召职工集中火力，向这十个方面围攻，因而在短期内收到了显著成效。
    这次运动也进一步体现了在党的领导下，领导干部，工程技术人员和工人群众三结合的方针。例如基建工程处机电车间党总支书记机电科长刘庆海与技术员、工人等七人一起试制成功了电动机，就是结合得较好的一个。
    由于运动开展迅猛，有些机具的质量不够高，需要进一步改进。现在，京西矿务局所属各矿、厂正在采取措施，巩固已有的成绩，进一步开展以大面积丰收为中心的技术革命运动。　（傅冬）（附图片）
