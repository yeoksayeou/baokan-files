    Communes Engage in Scientific Research
    The members of the Gejia People's Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, have launched mass scientific and technological research activities. Since last autumn, the commune has created a wind-powered rope-pulled plow, a wooden water pump, a double-layered internal and external steel smelting furnace, as well as a sweet potato plowing and slicing machine; in addition, they have used nitrate to produce a large amount of explosives, and have learned methods for producing cement, pulp, and alcohol.
    These scientific and technological achievements have powerfully promoted production and liberated the minds of the peasants. (According to a report from the Dazhong Daily)

    公社搞科学研究
    山东文登县葛家人民公社社员展开群众性科学技术研究活动。去秋以来，这个社创造了风动绳索牵引犁、木制抽水机、内外两层焖钢炉以及翻地瓜犁和切片机；另外，利用硝盐制成了大量炸药，学会了生产水泥、纸浆、酒精的方法。
    这些科学技术上的成就，有力地推动了生产，也解放了农民的思想。　　（据大众日报消息）
