　　Prevent Disasters, Protect the Harvest
　　Among the measures recently adopted by the Suzhou Special District to increase the production of three types of wheat (wheat, barley, naked barley), while strengthening field management, it has particularly strengthened the struggle to prevent natural disasters based on recent waterlogging and the incidence of pests and diseases in previous years. This is of great significance for striving for a bumper summer harvest.
　　Now the wheat fields in both the north and the south are a lush green, and the wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. People are happy that this year's wheat has a "good foundation." However, in addition to being happy, we must strengthen "nurturing" and care to ensure that the wheat grows smoothly. A "good foundation" is only the preliminary basis for the development and growth of wheat. In order to strive for a bumper harvest on this basis, on the one hand, we must continuously strengthen regular field management, and on the other hand, we must fight against natural disasters such as floods, droughts, pests, diseases, frost, and lodging.
　　In order to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, it is necessary to break through several "thresholds" according to the growth pattern of wheat; at the same time, it is necessary to prevent the invasion of natural disasters at any time. At any "threshold," crops may be attacked by natural disasters. If we do not pay attention to disaster prevention and resistance, no matter how good the "innate" conditions of the wheat are, and no matter how good the "acquired" growth of the wheat is, a rust disease will have a devastating impact on the wheat harvest; a frost will freeze a lot of wheat seedlings. Therefore, in the process of wheat growth, every threshold must be very careful. This situation is like war. A clever military commander is not only good at directing troops to fight the enemy on the main battlefield, but also knows how to prevent and crush the enemy's sneak attacks and ambushes. Regular field management of wheat is like fighting on the main battlefield; fighting against natural disasters that may strike at any time is like fighting against cunning enemies that attack suddenly. In order to avoid being defeated by a surprise attack by the enemy because of being caught off guard, it is necessary to prepare in advance. We often say that the situation should be estimated from the worst possible perspective, and the purpose is to strengthen vigilance, deal with accidents, and prevent unforeseen circumstances. In fact, although natural disasters are unpredictable, they are not inscrutable. As long as we earnestly study the occurrence patterns of floods, droughts, frosts, pests, diseases, etc. in previous years, carefully analyze the various new situations in this year's production, strengthen the forecasting and prediction of disasters, and prepare medicines, machinery and other disaster-resistant tools as early as possible, we will have the strength to resist and reduce disaster losses once a disaster strikes; some disasters, if well prevented, can be extinguished as soon as they occur, preventing them from spreading and causing harm. This is exactly what the Suzhou Special District is doing. According to the "enemy situation," the special district has made proper arrangements for flood resistance, pest and disease control, and lodging prevention, taking the initiative by attacking defensively. They launched a "five-no movement" in the Red Flag competition, with no third-class seedlings, no flood damage, no pests and diseases, no lodging, and no weeds. This practice is worth promoting. We believe that as long as all localities strengthen regular field management and actively take disaster prevention and resistance measures, any difficult thresholds on the road to high wheat yields can be broken through one by one, and the victory of a greater summer harvest will eventually be won.

### 防灾害  保丰收

    防灾害  保丰收
    苏州专区最近采取的三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）增产措施中，在加强田间管理的同时，特别根据近来雨涝和历年的病虫害情况，大大加强了防御自然灾害的斗争。这对于争取夏季大丰收，有着重大的意义。
    现在南北方的麦田都是一片葱绿，麦苗生长茁壮。人们都为今年的麦子“先天足”而欢喜。但是，在欢喜之余，我们更要加强“后天”的培育和护理，确保麦子顺利发育成长。“先天足”，只是麦子发育成长的初步基础，为了在这个基础上争取大丰收，一方面要不断地加强经常性的田间管理，一方面要同水旱、病虫害、霜冻、倒伏等自然灾害作斗争。
    为了确保麦田大丰收，要按照麦子的生长规律突破几个“关口”；同时，还要随时防止自然灾害的袭击。不论在哪一个“关口”上，庄稼都有可能遭受自然灾害的突袭。如果不注意防灾抗灾，不论麦子的“先天”条件怎样好，也不论麦子的“后天”生长状况怎样好，一场锈病会对小麦收成造成毁灭性的打击；一场霜冻会把麦苗冻坏很多。所以在小麦生长过程，每一个关都必须十分小心。这种情形如同战争，聪明的军事统帅不但善于指挥部队同正面战场上的敌人作战，而且懂得如何预防和粉碎敌人的偷袭和伏击。小麦的经常性的田间管理，好比正面战场上的战斗；同随时都可能袭来的自然灾害作斗争，好比是跟突然来袭的狡猾的敌人作战。为了避免在遭受到敌军突袭时因为措手不及而吃败仗，就必须事先早做准备。我们常说，估计情况要从最坏的可能方面设想，其目的就是加强戒备，应付意外，以防万一。其实，自然灾害虽然出没无常，但也并不是不可捉摸的。只要认真研究历年来水旱、霜冻、病虫害等的发生规律，细心分析今年生产上的各种新情况，加强灾害的预测预报工作，及早筹备药械和其他抗灾工具，一旦灾害袭来，也就有力量抵抗，减少受灾损失；有些灾害，如果对它们预防得好，在它们刚一发生的时候就可以扑灭，使它们不能蔓延为害。苏州专区正是这样做的。这个专区已经根据“敌情”，在抗涝、防治病虫害、防止倒伏等方面作了妥善的部署，以攻为守，力争主动。他们在红旗竞赛中展开了无三类苗、无涝害、无病虫害、无倒伏、无杂草的“五无运动”。这种做法，值得推广。我们相信，只要各地在加强经常性的田间管理的同时，积极采取防灾抗灾的措施，小麦大丰产的道路上的任何难攻的关口，都可以一个一个地攻破，最后必将赢得夏季更大丰收的胜利。
