Spring Arrives, Advances Downward, All Things are New
    —A Record of the Technical Revolution at the Chengzi Coal Mine
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    We sat in the cage, and in the blink of an eye, we descended to 130 meters below the surface at the Chengzi Coal Mine.
    It was brightly lit down in the mine, and everything was visible. This was a tunnel, about the width of a room, with two narrow electric tram tracks running side by side. The tunnel was quiet; we didn't see a single person for quite a while. I remembered that the last few times I went down the mine, there were people everywhere, pushing coal carts weighing more than a ton, running back and forth. Why were there so few people this time? As I was wondering, a train suddenly came along, and I quickly stepped aside. This train had a string of twenty-odd carts, carrying a lot of coal; it took a long time to pass. The engine seemed to be missing something; it didn't look quite right. I asked someone, and a mine worker laughed: "Of course! This isn't really a train; it was cobbled together by the workers from scrap iron. The chassis is made from a broken diesel locomotive. The train doesn't even have gauges or a control lever, just a brake, but it works really well and is effortless to use; even women can drive it." These simple "coal-carrying electric trains" have freed up over a hundred cart pushers in the mine, who have all "transferred" to coal mining. No wonder there are so few people in the tunnel. As we walked further, we suddenly saw a small cave, with a large pile of wood stacked in front of it. A person was there tying up the wood with rope. The wood was six or seven feet long and about a foot thick. After tying it up, he shouted, and in the blink of an eye, a steel cable hoisted the wood up through the small cave. What was this? As we explored further, the coal seam became lower and lower, and the road became more and more difficult to walk. No, it couldn't be called walking anymore; we started to climb. We climbed and climbed, and soon we were covered in sweat. I looked up suddenly and bumped my head on the coal, which hurt a lot. I didn't even notice when I got a splinter in my hand, which hurt so much I wanted to shout! At that moment, I saw a person squatting there untying the rope from the wood. We had originally thought that this wood-pulling machine must be a very large machine, but now we saw, surprisingly, that the machine only had two small gears, the larger one about the size of a bicycle freewheel, with a very small electric drill mounted on top. The worker using the machine said: "This was figured out by the workers in four or five days. It looks very simple, but it's very convenient to use. It can pull a piece of wood up from the cave in two or three minutes. With this thing, the workers are saving a lot of effort!" What he said was absolutely true. We were already exhausted from just climbing, but if the workers had to carry two hundred pounds of wood on their backs and climb all day, that would be really hard work!
    After circling around for a long time, we climbed into another cave. The light was dim, and we couldn't see how big the working face was. There were many pillars, as dense as a forest. Small mining lamps flickered in the distance. We heard the sound of a jackhammer drilling holes, and we thought that the workers working with a twenty- or thirty-pound jackhammer in this mine shaft must be very tired. When we walked over, we saw that people were standing there empty-handed. On closer inspection, we saw that the jackhammer was placed on an iron frame. Without asking, it was clear: the workers had come up with a great idea, and the iron frame saved people a lot of effort. Further ahead, a group of people were standing next to a small electric chute, about seven feet long, shoveling coal with iron shovels. After they finished shoveling, they moved the small electric chute to another place to shovel. It was strange; we remembered that it used to take three people a whole day to install an electric chute, but now, moving the electric chute was as easy as a child playing with toys! After asking around, we learned that it was made by the workers from scrap materials, didn't cost much, and was very efficient. After walking for a while, we saw more and more people, one person every four or five steps. The comrade giving us the tour spoke loudly to them, and we faintly heard them talking about machines. We asked, and our guide laughed. He led us down a few steps and told us to squat down and see what was at our feet. It turned out that next to the chute was a machine like the wood-pulling machine, only with a board on top. This thing was called a coal-pushing plate. When the board was placed on the coal, it pushed the coal down like a plow. With this coal-pushing plate, there was no need for a large group of people to shovel coal. Now the board was broken, so a large group of people were working here. The people we were with said that they had just been discussing this and planned to fix the board in a day or two.
    After passing a working face, we saw an eight- or nine-foot-long belt conveyor. One end of the conveyor was placed diagonally on the ground, and the other end was placed on a mine car. People shoveled coal onto the belt, and the coal fell into the cart with a clatter. This was built by a worker named Zhang Zhizhong using scrap materials. In the past, loading coal by hand was tiring, and it took eight or nine minutes to load a cart (one cart is 1.2 tons). Now it only takes three or four minutes.
    We had been underground for several hours and were about to go up when we turned a corner and suddenly heard the sound of a waterfall. Water splashed at our feet; we had arrived at the hydraulic mining area. We wanted to go to the top to take a look, and we thought there must be many people up there. When we got to the top, we saw, surprisingly, that there were only three people standing there sparsely. One person was holding a large pipe, like a faucet, and spraying water. The water was very powerful, shooting out for several yards. The area in front was a white mist, but the coal was falling down with a clatter. Two workers were using iron shovels to gently push the coal into the chute, and the coal was washed away by the water. Standing there, we suddenly thought of a poem written by a worker: "There is a Jiulong Mountain in Western Beijing, Legend says nine dragons lie beside the mountain, Now nine dragons lie among men, Willingly descending to become water guns." Isn't that exactly what we were seeing?
    The person leading our tour saw that we were stunned and quickly said that hydraulic mining has many advantages. It can save half the workers, use half as much timber as dry mining, and use fewer equipment. However, the efficiency is almost twice as high as dry mining. That was already amazing, but the biggest benefit wasn't even those things. With hydraulic mining, there is no dust in the mine, the workers' health conditions are good, and mining doesn't require going into the top of the mine, which is very safe.
    Back at the mine, we went to the technical revolution office to get some materials. It said: "Over 90% of the people in the entire mine have made suggestions for improving tools. A total of ninety-eight machines have been successfully made (totaling one hundred and fifty-one pieces), of which eighty-eight (one hundred and forty-one pieces) were suggested and made by the workers themselves. This has freed up seven hundred and forty-two of the nine hundred and fifty-five people in the entire mine who were doing heavy manual labor, and some people have been transferred to support other mines."
    The comrades in the technical revolution office said that the technical revolution movement in the mine wasn't smooth sailing. In the beginning, many people lacked confidence, saying that they had little education and couldn't come up with anything. After the leaders found out, they organized everyone to have a big airing of views, a big debate: Can coal miners engage in mechanization? Can they sing their own tunes? The masses posted over eight hundred big-character posters, criticizing various erroneous ideas. A worker named Wang Fa plucked up his courage and managed to make a coal-pushing plate with an electric drill. The leadership seized on this event to promote it to everyone. This boosted everyone's morale. Everyone said, "Wang Fa doesn't know a single character, but he can make a machine. Why can't we?" The masses wrote poems to express their determination: "Tricks are running all over the ground, see if you can find them. As long as you use your brain, the tricks can't escape." The movement unfolded like this. In less than a month, over a hundred tools were made.
    We went to the Party committee, wanting to talk to the Party secretary. When we pushed open the door, the room was full of people, and they were having a meeting. It was already ten o'clock at night, and the meeting hadn't adjourned. We stood on the balcony of the office, looking at the brightly lit mine. Small electric trams pulled strings of coal carts back and forth. Above and below the mine, people hadn't rested; they were all there fighting tensely. We thought of the new targets that the mine had put forward: to produce 1.05 million tons of coal in 1959! This number wasn't small; it was almost double the 660,000 tons of last year. Could they complete it? People couldn't help but worry about them, but the cadres and workers of this mine were full of confidence. One of their methods was to continue to carry out the technical revolution movement. The workers had already written heroic words: "As long as we do a good job in the technical revolution, we will definitely be able to plant the red flag on the highest peak!" (Attached image)

    春到进下万事新
    ——记城子煤矿的技术革命
    本报记者　傅冬
    我们坐着罐笼，转眼功夫，就下到了离地面一百三十公尺的城子煤矿底下。
    矿底下明晃晃的，一切都看得见。这是一条巷道，有一间房宽，两条小电车道并排在路上。巷道里冷清清的，半天也没见着一个人。记得前几次下井，巷道里到处是人，人们推着一吨多重的煤斗子，跑来跑去，怎么这次都没了？正想着，忽然来车了，急忙躲在一边。这车子二十几个斗子一拉溜，拉的煤可真不少，过了好半天才过完。车头好像缺点什么似的，看上去不怎么顺眼。打问一声，矿上的人笑了：“可不是，这本来就不是个车，是工人用废铁板拼凑成的，底盘是用破柴油机车改的。车上连仪表和操纵杆都没有，只有个闸，可是用起来却很顶事，一点也不费力，妇女也开得动。”就是这些简单的“运煤电车”，使矿下省下一百多推车工，他们都“转业”去采煤，毋怪巷道里的人这样少了。往前走一程，忽然看见一个小窑洞，洞上堆着一大堆木头。有一个人正在那里用绳子捆木头，那木头有六、七尺长，一尺来粗，捆好后，他喊了一声，一眨眼功夫，钢绳就吊着木头顺着小窑洞上去了。这是什么？往前探去，这时煤层越来越低，路越来越不好走了。不，不能说是走路了，我们开始爬了。爬呀，爬呀，不一会，就爬得浑身是汗，猛一抬头，撞到煤上好痛，手也不知什么时候给弄进一根刺，痛得真想喊叫！这时只见一个人蹲在那里解木头上的绳子。原先我们以为这个拉木机一定是个很大很大的机器，现在一看，奇怪，机器上只有两个小齿轮，大的和自行车上的飞轮差不多，上面安着一个很小很小的电钻。使用机器的工人说：“这是工人们花了四、五天功夫琢磨出来的。看样子很简单，用起来却挺方便，两三分钟就能从洞内拉上来一根木头。有了这东西，工人省力可大啦！”他这话说得一点不错，我们光人爬都累成这个狼狈相，如果工人们背着二百多斤重的木头成天爬，那劳动真不简单啊！
    又绕了半天，我们又爬进另一个窑洞。灯不亮，也看不清这掌子面有多大，只见柱子不少，密得就像树林子一样。一盏一盏的小矿灯在远处闪来闪去。听见风钻打眼的声音，我们心想，在这矿窑里，工人同志抱着二、三十斤的风钻干活，一定会很累吧？走过去一看，那知人们却空手站在那里，再仔细一看，见风钻放在铁架子上。用不着问，一看就明白了：工人们想的真好，他们造出这铁架子，人可省劲了。再向前，一群人正站在一个七尺多长的小电溜子旁边用铁锨铲煤，铲完了，他们把小电溜子搬到另一个地方去铲。真怪，我们记得以前安电溜子要三个人整整安一天才能安完，现在，搬电溜子怎么容易得就像小孩玩玩具似的？打听了一下，知道这是工人用废料作的，没花什么钱，效率却很高。又走了一阵，见人渐渐多了，四、五步就有一个人。给我们介绍情况的同志大声和他们谈话，隐隐约约听见他们谈什么机器机器的，问了一声，我们的带路人笑了，他领我们往下走了几步，然后叫我们蹲下来看脚下是个什么？原来在溜子旁边放着一个像拉木机一样的机器，上面只是多了块板子。这东西叫推煤板，那个板就像耕地的犁一样，一放上去就把煤推下来了。有了这么个推煤板，就用不着一大群人铲煤了。现在那个板子坏了，所以一大群人在这里劳动。同行的人说，他们刚才商量的就是这事，打算一、两天把这板子收拾好。
    走过一个掌子面，见那里摆着一个八、九尺长的皮带运输机，这个运输机一头斜放在地面上，一头放在矿车上，人把煤铲到皮带上，煤就沿着皮带哗哗地落在斗子里。这是一个叫张执中的工人用废料搭成的。过去用人装煤，人累且不说，八、九分钟才能装一斗子（一斗是一吨二），现在只要三、四分钟就行了。
    在井下呆了好几个钟头了正想上来，转了个弯，忽然听见瀑布的声音，脚下水花四溅，原来到了水力采煤的地方。我们想到顶头去看看，我们一面走一面想上面一定很多人。到了上面一看，怎么稀稀拉拉的只站着三个人？有一个人拿着个像水龙头似的大管子往外放水，水势很激，射出好几丈远，前面白茫茫一片，煤却哗哗地往下落、有两个工人拿着铁锨轻轻地把煤推到溜槽子里，煤就顺水冲走了。我们站在那里突然想起了工人写的诗：“京西有座九龙山，传说九龙卧山边，如今九龙卧人间，自愿下凡变水枪”。眼前的景象不正是这样吗？
    带领我们参观的人见我们看呆了，忙说，水力采煤的好处多极了，可以省一半工人，坑木比旱采省一半还多，设备也用的少，可是效率却差不多比旱采高一倍。这已经够叫人吃惊的了，但最大的好处还不是这些，用水力采煤，井里没尘烟，工人卫生条件好，采矿用不着跑到矿顶里头去，很安全。
    回到矿上，我们到技术革命办公室要了一份材料。那上面写着：“全矿有90％以上的人都提过革新工具的建议，一共制成功九十八项机器（合一百五十一件），这里面有八十八项
  （一百四十一件）是工人自己提出建议，自己作的。这样就使全矿九百五十五个作笨重体力劳动的人，解放出来七百四十二人，并抽出一些人支援别的矿井。”
    技术革命办公室的同志说，矿上的技术革命运动不是一帆风顺的。开始，好多人没信心，说自己文化低，还能提出什么来。领导干部知道后，就组织大家大鸣大放大辩论：煤矿工人能不能搞机械化？能不能自拉自唱？群众贴了八百多张大字报，批判各种错误思想。一个名叫王发的工人鼓了把劲，七弄八弄作出个电钻推煤板。领导上抓住这件事向大家宣传，这一下把大伙的劲鼓起来了，大伙说，王发一个字不识，都能造出机器，咱们怎么就不行！群众写诗表决心：“窍门满地跑，看你找不找，只要动脑筋，窍门跑不了”。运动就这样展开了。不到一个月功夫，就作出了一百多件工具。
    到党委会去，想找党委书记谈谈，一推开门，满满的一屋子人，他们正在开会。已经是夜里十点钟了，会还没有散，我们站在办公室的阳台上，看满矿灯火辉煌。小电车拉着一串串的煤斗走来走去矿上，矿下，人们还没有休息，他们都在那里紧张的战斗。我们想起矿　上新提出来的指标：1959年要产煤一百零五万吨！这个数目字不小，比去年的六十六万吨差不多要翻一番。能不能完成？人们不能不为他们担心，但是这个矿的干部和工人们却信心十足，他们的办法之一，就是要继续开展技术革命运动。工人们早写下了豪言壮语：“只要我们搞好技术革命，我们一定能把红旗插在最高峰！”（附图片）
