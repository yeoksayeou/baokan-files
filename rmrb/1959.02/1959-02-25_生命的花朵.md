    The Flower of Life
    Bai Yuan
    Spring has arrived. In the magnificent spring of the socialist Great Leap Forward, the flowers of life bloom even more brilliantly than the flowers of the earth...
    In the south of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, nestled among the rolling mountains, there is a place where rows of white stone pigsties line the hillsides. From a distance, they resemble terraced buildings clinging to the mountains. Smoke rises from the feed rooms scattered across the slopes. This is the 10,000-pig farm of the Ping’an Chengzi People’s Commune. Walking along the neat main road within the farm, one sees massive piles of fertilizer accumulated from the pigsties. In front of each row of pigsties, there are rows of stone troughs. When it's time to release the pigs for feeding, groups of pigs of all sizes spread across the hillsides, like a pig kingdom built in people's ideals. Among the rows of pigsties lining the hillside, there are pigsties for sows, pigsties for boars, pigsties for young piglets, and pigsties for half-grown pigs. Fat pigs need fattening, weak pigs need care, and sows about to give birth need tending to. Each has a specialized pigsty to live in. Because the pig hospital needs to be separated from the general pigsties, it is built on another hillside across a valley. The bell for work and rest rings in the valley. Caretakers in clean white aprons walk in groups from the dormitories to the pigsties. Among the caretakers are experienced pig farmers in their fifties, and diligent young men and women. The cause of socialism connects their lives to the great ideals of humanity; their diligent, selfless labor makes the flowers of their lives bloom fragrantly and brilliantly.
    Yes, the flower of life – this is a magnificent name, and it should belong to all selfless people in the world. They have beautiful ideals and an unfading youth. At the 10,000-pig farm, there are two veterans in their thirties, one is the Party Branch Secretary of the farm, Zhang Baotian, and the other is the farm director, Ma Jingzhen. It seems as if fate had arranged it beforehand: in the army, one was from the south and the other from the north, they were not together, but both were brave on the battlefield. Later, because they were wounded, they both returned to their hometowns with only one leg. Now they are running this 10,000-pig farm together, seemingly for no other reason than to prove to people that nothing in the world can conquer life. The flowers of life blooming in the beautiful ideals of humanity have brought them unfading youth. Leaning on their wooden crutches, whether going up or down the mountains, whether day or night, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with them. They run to the pig hospital to check on things, consult with the caretakers to solve problems at work, and then run into the feed room. How is the isolation work being done in the pig hospital? Does the feed made in the feed room meet the standards? In the quiet of the mountains at night, the lights in their rooms are still on. How many things need to be arranged for tomorrow? How many sows are about to give birth? Who is on duty at the pigsties tonight? Sometimes they are worried, so they put on their clothes, lean on their wooden crutches, climb the terraced hills in the dark, and go through the rows of pigsties to check everything. Sometimes, after a whole day of work, the sun has already set, and the commune calls them to go to the commune committee for a meeting. So they get on their bicycles and leave. To get from the 10,000-pig farm to Ping'an Chengzi, where the commune committee is located, they have to climb over hills, cross ditches, and travel through the winding paths of village after village. How can they pedal a bicycle with only one leg? They came up with a solution: they installed a thick iron block on the pedal of the bicycle on the legless side. One foot pedals on one side, using the weight of the iron block to drop down on the other side. In this way, they pedal the bicycle with one leg, crossing mountains and ridges, going anywhere. People who see them say they have great skills, but they don't know how marvelous the power of an unfading youthful life is!
    If someone does not understand selfless labor, then it is difficult to understand the selfless feelings that arise from the purest hearts. There is a caretaker in his fifties named Cheng Yin, who is the leader of the fifth group in charge of fattening pigs at the farm. He is thin, and the life of the old society has bent his back, and a pair of kind eyes shine from his hardworking face. One night, the caretaker on night duty in their group was a young man named Li Youlan. In addition to taking care of the general safety of the pigsties, the caretaker on night duty has to get the pigs up three or four times a night to prevent them from urinating in their nests, which can easily lead to illness, as the pigs sleep very soundly at night. That night, when Li Youlan opened the door of a pigsty to let the pigs out, he accidentally let two pigs escape. Li Youlan searched everywhere in the dark but couldn't find them, so he ran back to the dormitory to tell Cheng Yin. When Cheng Yin heard that the pigs had escaped, he hurriedly got out of bed and went with Li Youlan to search the mountains again. They searched every mountain top and every valley in the middle of the night, but the pigs were still not found. Back in the dormitory, Cheng Yin sat on the edge of the bed, bent over, without saying a word, but suddenly he began to cry with a runny nose and tears. The caretakers in the dormitory all got up to comfort him, but he refused to go to sleep no matter how they tried. It wasn't until the next morning that someone ran over and said that the pigs had been found. Cheng Yin and everyone ran over to take a look and found that the two pigs had run into another group's pigsty in the dark. Cheng Yin looked at them and started to laugh. People asked him:
  "Cheng Yin, you're so old, why did you cry over two pigs?" He said: "It's because I'm getting old, and I can't be anxious. When I encounter something urgent, a chill rushes up my spine, and I can't stop the tears from falling..." Yes, perhaps it's because he's getting old, but what's falling are not tears, but the dew of spring dripping from the petals of a life that has weathered many storms.
    Speaking of the caretakers' stories, there are endless things to say. Among the caretakers at the 10,000-pig farm, half are female, and almost all are young women of eighteen or nineteen. To take care of them, the farm does not allow them to work night shifts. But they manage a lot of things. The sows, piglets, and weak pigs at the farm are mostly assigned to them. They are specially assigned to care for sows about to give birth, and they assist in the delivery when they give birth. Sometimes, when they see that a sow is about to give birth, they watch over her all night, but some sows don't give birth until the next morning. If it's a cold day, after a litter of piglets is born, the female caretaker who assisted in the delivery, feeling sorry for them, takes turns holding the newborn piglets in her arms to warm them, warming this one and then warming that one. There is a nineteen-year-old girl named Huang Fengqin. If you ever see her, you will definitely say: what a beautiful girl! A round face, a pair of clever eyes with a bit of childishness, yet so deep. Last winter, the farm assigned her to be in charge of a row of pigsties for weak pigs. Seeing that the pigs were not eating well, and some were constantly getting sick, she was very worried and often stayed by the pigsties, saying to everyone she met: "Look at these pigs, when will they grow well!" As time went on, because she was always thinking about those pigs, she didn't want to eat or sleep. The farm thought she was tired and needed to eat something softer, but when the kitchen made her fine noodles and brought them to her, she still didn't eat them. When asked, "What's wrong?" she smiled and just said:
  "Nothing, I just don't want to eat." She often stood alone in the morning sunlight, leaning against the side door of the dormitory, staring blankly at the 10,000-pig farm filled with rows of pigsties, watching the wisps of smoke rising from the many feed rooms... She was always thinking: "Look at these pigs, when will they grow well!"
    Now, spring has arrived. In the warming days, the mountains are full of bright spring sunshine. The pigs from the 10,000-pig farm are grazing all over the hills and fields of the commune. In the evening, the caretakers carry buckets of steaming feed from the feed rooms, walking on the roads leading to the pigsties. The pigs, well-fed, leave the troughs one by one. Those large fat pigs weighing six or seven hundred pounds eat the most, eating until the very end. After all the pigs, big and small, have entered the pigsties, they still stroll on the smooth roads swept clean in front of the doors... The warm spring breeze blows the white aprons of the caretakers in the twilight, and the evening bell for the end of work echoes in the valley... For the construction of a happy socialist life, it sings in praise, praising the beautiful ideals of humanity, praising the flowers of life blooming in diligent, selfless labor.

    生命的花朵
    白原
    春天来了。绚丽的社会主义大跃进的春天，生命的花朵比大地的花朵开得还要灿烂……。
    在河北省遵化县的南边，在重叠的山峦当中有一个地方，一排排石头建筑的粉白的猪舍排满山坡，远远望去，好像一层层倚山建筑的楼房，从散布在山坡上的饲料房里升起漫山遍野的炊烟。这就是平安城子人民公社的万猪场。沿着那一条万猪场当中的整洁的大路往里走，山坡上堆着一大堆一大堆从猪场里积起来的肥料。在每一排猪舍的门前，排列着一列列用长石头凿成的食槽。到了把猪放出来吃食的时候，一群群大大小小的猪群满山满坡，就好像人们在理想中建造的一片猪的王国一样。在排满山坡的那一排排猪舍当中，有母猪居住的猪舍，有公猪居住的猪舍，幼小的子猪住在子猪的猪舍里，半大的?狼就住在?狼的猪舍；肥猪需要催肥，弱猪需要照顾，快要分娩的母猪需要看护，都有专门的猪舍让它们居住；猪病院因为要和一般的猪舍隔离，隔一个山头另外建筑在一个山坡上。按时作息的钟声在山谷里响着。饲养员们穿着洁白的围裙一群群地走在从宿舍通往猪舍的道路上。在那些饲养员们当中，有五十多岁的养猪老手，有勤劳的小伙子和年青的姑娘。社会主义的事业使他们的生活连结着人类的伟大的理想；辛勤的、忘我的劳动使他们的生命的花朵开得芬芳灿烂。
    是的，生命的花朵，这是一个瑰丽的名字，这个名字应当属于所有世上的忘我的人们，他们有着美丽的理想，有着不会消逝的青春。在万猪场里，有两个三十多岁的退伍军人，一个是万猪场的党支部书记张宝田，一个是场长马景珍。好像是命运预先配搭好的一样：在部队里，一个天南，一个地北，两个人不在一起，可是在战场上都很勇敢，后来因为负了伤，两个人都只带着一条腿回到了家乡。现在他们两个在一起经营着这片万猪场，好像不是为了别的，只是为了向人们证明：在世界上，没有什么力量能够征服生命。在人类的美丽的理想中开放的生命的花朵，给他们带来了不会消逝的青春。他们拄着木拐子，不管上山、下山，也不管是白天或是黑夜，和他们走在一起，有时候简直跟不上他们。他们一会跑到猪病院去看看，一会找饲养员商量解决工作上的问题，一会又跑进饲料房。猪病院里的隔离工作做得怎么样？饲料房做的饲料合不合规格？山里夜深人静，他们的房间里还亮着灯光。明天有多少事情需要安排？有多少母猪就要分娩？今夜在猪舍那边值班的都是些什么人？有时候他们不放心，披上衣服，拄着木拐，在黑夜里爬上一层层的山坡，沿着那一排排猪舍去看一遍。有时候，他们忙了一整天，太阳已经落了山，公社来了电话，叫他们赶到社委会去开会，于是他们骑上自行车就走了。从万猪场到社委会所在的平安城子，要翻过山坡，越过河沟，穿过一个村子又一个村子的弯弯拐拐的小路，一条腿骑着自行车怎么蹬？他们想出了一个办法，在没有腿的一边自行车的脚踏上装上一块厚铁块，一只脚在一边蹬着，利用铁块的重量在另一边坠下去，就这样一条腿蹬着自行车，翻山越岭，什么地方也去。看见的人都说他们的本领大，却不知永不消逝的青春的生命蕴藏着多么奇妙的力量！
    如果有人不理解忘我的劳动，那就很难理解从最纯洁的心灵中产生的那种忘我的感情。有一个五十多岁的饲养员叫程印，是万猪场里专门管理肥猪的第五组的组长，瘦瘦的个子，旧社会的生活把他压弯了腰，一副辛劳的脸上闪着一双善良的眼睛。一天夜里，他们组值夜班的饲养员是一个年青小伙子叫李有兰。值夜班的饲养员除了照管猪舍的一般安全以外，因为怕猪在夜里尿窝，容易生病，而猪在夜里又睡得很死，所以一夜要让它们起来三、四次。那天夜里李有兰把一间猪舍的门打开让猪起来的时候，不小心让两只猪跑了出来。李有兰在黑夜里到处找也找不着，就跑回宿舍去告诉程印。程印听说猪跑了，赶忙从床上爬起来，和李有兰一起再到山上去找。他们在深夜里找遍了每一座山头，搜尽了每一个山谷，可是猪始终还是没有找着。回到宿舍，程印弯着腰坐在床边上，一句话也不说，一下子却一把鼻涕一把眼泪地哭起来，弄得宿舍里的饲养员们都起来劝他，但怎么劝也不肯去睡。一直到第二天早上，有人跑来说猪找着了。程印和大家一起跑去一看，原来是那两只猪在黑夜里跑到另一个组的猪舍里去了。程印一边看着一边就笑起来。人家问他：
  “程印，这么大的年纪，怎么为着两只猪就哭起来？”他说：“就是因为年纪大了，心里急不得，碰到着急的事情，脊梁上一股凉气冲上来，就止不住掉眼泪……。”是的，也许是因为年纪大了，可是那掉下来的不是眼泪，而是从那历尽风霜的生命的花瓣上滴落的春天的露水。
    说起饲养员们的事情来，那真是说不完。在万猪场的饲养员当中，有一半是女饲养员，而且差不多都是十八、九岁的年青姑娘。为了照顾她们，猪场里不让她们值夜班。可是她们管的事情可真不少。万猪场里的母猪、子猪、弱猪大都分配给她们管，快要分娩的母猪专门由她们来看护，分娩的时候就由她们来接生。有时候，眼看母猪就要分娩了，她们在旁边守了一夜，可是有的母猪一直到第二天早上才把小猪生下。如果是在冷天，一窝小猪生下来以后，接生的女饲养员因为看起来心疼，就把刚生下来的小猪轮流抱到怀里暖着，暖暖这只又暖暖那只。有一个十九岁的姑娘叫黄凤琴，如果什么时候你看见她，那你一定会说：那是一个多么美的姑娘！圆圆的脸庞，一双灵俏的眼睛带着几分稚气，却又那么深沉。去年冬天，场里分配她专门看管一排弱猪的猪舍。她看见那些猪老是不好好吃，有的三天两头净闹病，心里着急得不行，常常守在猪舍的旁边，逢人就说：“看这猪，什么时候能长好呵！”日子久了，因为心里老是记挂着那些猪，饭也不想吃，觉也睡不着。场里以为她是累着了，需要吃些软和点的东西？可是厨房里给她做了细面条，端到她面前，她还是没有吃。问她：“怎么啦？”她笑了笑，只是说：
  “怎么也不怎么，就是不想吃。”她老是一个人站在早晨的阳光下，倚着宿舍的旁门边，呆呆地望着那一片布满了一排排猪舍的万猪场，望着从那许多饲料房里升起的那一缕缕的炊烟……。她心里老是记挂着：“看这猪，什么时候能长好呵！”
    现在，春天已经来了。在开始暖和的日子里，山上一片明媚的春光，在公社的山野上遍山遍野放牧着万猪场的猪群。傍晚，饲养员们从饲料房里挑着一桶桶热气腾腾的饲料，走在那一条条通往猪舍的道路上。吃饱了的猪一只只离开了食槽。那些六、七百斤重的大肥猪因为吃得多，一直吃到最后，等到所有的大大小小的猪都进了猪舍，它们还在门前打扫得光溜溜的道路上散步……。春日的暖风在暮色里吹动着饲养员们的白色的围裙，下班的晚钟一声声在山谷里回响……。为了建设社会主义的幸福的生活，它在一声声歌颂，歌颂人类的美丽的理想，歌颂所有在辛勤的、忘我的劳动中开放的生命的花朵。
