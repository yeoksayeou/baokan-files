Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Japanese labor leader Minoru Takano yesterday called on the Japanese working class to wage a thorough struggle against all the conspiracies of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

At a meeting of labor activists in western Tokyo, Takano exposed and severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracies to pass a budget bill of a war-preparation nature, to pass a minimum wage bill allowing capitalists to arbitrarily determine wages, and to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Takano pointed out that the Japanese working class possesses great potential strength, and said that this potential strength is the source of the working class's victory. Takano said that the struggles against the "performance rating" system last year, the struggle of the Oji Paper Industrial Company's union, the struggle against revising the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the struggle to demand the acquittal of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" all achieved great results, which is clear evidence.

Takano said that this year's spring struggle of Japanese workers will inevitably develop into a powerful and long-term struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - Nobusuke Kishi's Chief Cabinet Secretary Munenori Akagi openly stated at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of the House of Councillors on the 13th that Japan could possess nuclear weapons "for the purpose of self-defense."

At the same time, he disseminated arguments against the Diet passing a resolution on prohibiting Japan from nuclear arming. He said: "We must carefully handle those resolutions (on prohibiting Japan from nuclear arming) that would semi-permanently bind the hands and feet of the (Japanese) government and the people."

Just one day before Akagi Munenori made this statement, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan was forced, under pressure from progressive parties and social public opinion, to agree that the Diet would pass a resolution on Japan not engaging in nuclear arming.

At the same Cabinet Committee meeting, Kenzo Takayanagi, chairman of the Constitution Investigation Committee, who is specifically responsible for revising the Japanese Constitution, deliberately distorted the provisions of the Japanese Constitution, saying: "According to the provisions of the Constitution, (Japan) can possess combat capabilities." He said that Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution "should not" be interpreted as Japan "not being able to possess all combat capabilities."

Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates that the Japanese people forever renounce war, threats, or the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes. "In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

The statements of Akagi Munenori and Kenzo Takayanagi expose the ambition of the Nobusuke Kishi government to undermine the Constitution and make Japan nuclear-armed.

    坚决反对岸政府反动阴谋
    内阁官房长官公然表示要使日本进行核武装
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本工会领袖高野实昨天号召日本工人阶级同岸信介政府的各种阴谋进行彻底的斗争。
    高野在东京西部地区工会积极分子会议上揭露了岸信介政府企图通过备战性质的预算案、通过只由资本家任意决定工资的最低工资法案、以及修改日美“安全条约”等阴谋，并且对这些阴谋进行了严厉的谴责。高野指出，日本工人阶级拥有伟大的潜在力量，并且说这种潜在力量正是工人阶级取得胜利的源泉。高野说，去年的反对“勤务评定”制度的斗争、王子造纸工业公司工会的斗争、反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争、禁止原子弹和氢弹运动、要求宣布“松川事件”被告无罪的斗争都获得了很大的战果，就是明证。
    高野说，今年日本工人的春季斗争必将发展为强有力的、长期的斗争。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：岸信介内阁官房长官赤城宗德13日在参议院内阁委员会会议上公然说，日本可以拥有“目的在于自卫”的核武器。
    他同时散布反对国会通过关于禁止日本进行核武装的决议的论调。他说：“要慎重处理那些会半永久性地束缚（日本）政府和国民手脚的（关于禁止日本核武装的）决议”。
    就在赤城宗德发表这个谈话的前一天，日本执政的自由民主党在进步党派和社会舆论的压力下被迫同意将由国会通过关于日本不进行核武装的决议。
    在同一次内阁委员会会议上，专门负责修改日本宪法的宪法调查会会长高柳贤三故意歪曲日本宪法的规定说：“按照宪法的规定，（日本）是可以拥有作战能力的”。他说，“不应该”把日本宪法第九条解释为日本“不能拥有一切作战能力”。
    日本宪法第九条明文规定，日本国民永远放弃用战争、威胁或者武力作为解决国际纷争的手段。“为达到前项目的计，不保持海陆空及其他战力，不承认国家的交战权。”
    赤城宗德和高柳贤三的谈话，暴露出岸信介政府企图破坏宪法使日本进行核武装的野心。（附图片）
