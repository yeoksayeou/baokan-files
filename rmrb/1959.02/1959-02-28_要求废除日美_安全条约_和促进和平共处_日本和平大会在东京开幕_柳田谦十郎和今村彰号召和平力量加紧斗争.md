    Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The "Peace Congress for the Abolition of the Security Treaty and the Promotion of Peaceful Coexistence," jointly organized by more than 30 groups in Japan, began today in Tokyo. Approximately 500 peace delegates from all over Japan are participating in this two-day congress.
    Kenjuro Yanagida, permanent director of the Japan Peace Committee, delivered a report at the congress. He pointed out that last year, the world's peace forces had dealt a severe blow to the world's war forces. He said that, as a result, there is now a possibility that if the peace forces make further efforts, they will eliminate war worldwide. He pointed out, "This year, we are at a crossroads as to whether this possibility can be realized."
    Yanagida spoke about the domestic situation in Japan, saying that under these circumstances, international war forces are trying their best to turn Japan into their springboard for aggression. He said that the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" very clearly demonstrates their purpose in this regard. Yanagida emphasized that the Japanese peace movement must launch an offensive to eliminate all pressure exerted on Japan, and to achieve the following goals as the most important common task of all Japanese democratic and peace forces: Oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive to abolish the treaty; restore diplomatic relations with China, conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, and develop friendly relations with neighboring countries; prohibit the testing and use of nuclear weapons.
    Akira Imamura, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), delivered a report at the congress entitled "The Working Class and the Peace Movement." He said that Japanese workers are gradually abandoning the idea that they can only engage in economic struggles, and are currently preparing to use their strength to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to prevent the Kishida Nobusuke government from submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law" amendment to the Diet again. Imamura said that in order to strengthen the struggle of Japanese workers, it is necessary for workers to establish closer ties with people from all other walks of life in factories and in society to repel the attacks of hostile classes.
    Subsequently, the congress heard reports on Japan-China relations, Japan-Soviet relations, the anti-nuclear weapon and military base movement, and other matters related to the struggle for the peace movement.
    Tomorrow, the delegates will break into groups to discuss various issues related to peace. The congress will close tomorrow afternoon after passing a plan of action and resolutions. (Attached photo)

    要求废除日美“安全条约”和促进和平共处
    日本和平大会在东京开幕
    柳田谦十郎和今村彰号召和平力量加紧斗争
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：由日本三十多个团体联合组织的“废除安全条约、促进和平共处和平大会”今天在东京开始举行。来自日本全国各地的和平代表约五百人参加了这个预定举行两天的大会。
    日本和平委员会常任理事柳田谦十郎在大会上作了报告。他指出，去年，世界和平力量已经给予世界战争势力以严重的打击。他说，因而，目前已经存在这样的可能性，即和平力量方面如果作出进一步的努力，将在全世界范围内消灭战争。他指出，“今年我们正处在能否使这种可能性获得实现的十字路口”。
    柳田谈到日本国内形势时说，在这种情况下，国际战争势力正在竭力把日本变成他们的侵略跳板。他说，修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋极其明显地表明了他们在这方面的目的。柳田强调说，日本和平运动必须展开攻势，来消除施加于日本的一切压力，并且把实现下列目标作为所有日本民主与和平力量的最重要的共同任务：反对修改日美“安全条约”，并且争取废除这个条约；同中国恢复外交关系，同苏联缔结和约，同邻国发展友好关系；禁止试验和使用核武器。
    日本工会总评议会副议长今村彰在大会上作了题为“工人阶级与和平运动”的报告。他说，日本工人正在逐渐放弃那种认为他们只能进行经济斗争的想法，目前正在准备使用实力来阻止修改日美“安全条约”，并且阻止岸信介政府再次把
  “警职法”修正案提交国会。今村说，为了加强日本工人的这一斗争，工人们有必要在工厂和社会上同其他各阶层人民建立更加密切的联系，来击退敌对阶级的进攻。
    随后，大会听取了关于日中关系、日苏关系、反对核武器和军事基地运动以及其他有关争取和平运动的报告。
    明天，代表们将分组讨论关于和平的各种问题。大会将在明天下午通过行动计划和决议以后闭幕。（附图片）
