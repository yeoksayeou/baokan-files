With the coming of warm weather and the blossoming of flowers, spring operations in nurseries are about to begin. Manure accumulation, manure transportation, seedling excavation, land cultivation, and sowing are several operations in spring nurseries that require a lot of manpower and animal power. Manure accumulation, manure transportation, and land cultivation can utilize existing advanced agricultural tools. However, the tools used for seedling excavation are unique to forestry, and using shovels and hoes requires too much labor. Although some tree species can be sown using agricultural sowing tools, seedling cultivation is not entirely the same as crop sowing, so they cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, using improved tools in these two operations is of great significance for saving labor and improving the quality of seedling cultivation. Here are several seedling excavation, land preparation, weeding, and sowing tools for local reference.

The seeding roller is suitable for sowing small seeds, which can improve efficiency by four to five times compared with manual sowing, and the sowing is more uniform, saving seeds. Its structure is simple, and many regions manufacture it. The general method of manufacturing is to wrap galvanized iron sheets with pre-drilled seeding holes on two round wooden boards (some are made entirely of galvanized iron), and open a seed filling port on the board to form a roller. Each cylinder is connected in series with wooden shafts, and a push handle is installed on the shaft.

The three-edged hoe is an advanced tool improved by the Tongtiangou Forest Management Station in Boli County, Heilongjiang Province. It is suitable for land preparation before afforestation and for weeding in young forests. Because the hoe is changed to a semi-elliptical shape with blades on three sides, it saves effort and improves work efficiency. One person can dig two to three hundred holes a day.

The direct seeding afforestation device is an advanced tool for sowing seeds of Masson pine and other small and medium-sized forest tree seeds suitable for direct seeding afforestation. It has a simple structure, low cost, convenient use, and high efficiency, and can complete hole opening and seeding at one time. Its structure mainly consists of a seed tube, seeding pipe, hole opening shovel, seeding device (hand-held or foot-operated), and T-shaped rod. Except for the hole opening shovel made of wrought iron and the seeding pipe made of iron sheet, the rest can be made of bamboo tubes and wood, with a total length of one meter.

This plow was created by the Hunan Provincial Forestry Department. The plowshare is shaped like a swallow's wings, with a traction rod in the front, and the angle of the plowshare entering the soil can be adjusted. It is suitable for digging small seedlings of coniferous trees and shallow-rooted broad-leaved trees in the south, and it can also be used for loosening or cultivating the land. One person and one cow can dig five acres of seedlings a day, which is ten times more efficient than using shovels and hoes. (Attached pictures)

    林业生产的改良工具
    春暖花开以后，苗圃春季作业就要开始。积肥、运肥、掘苗、耕地、播种等是苗圃春季作业中需要人、畜力较多的几项作业，其中积肥、运肥、耕地，可以利用现成的农业先进工具，掘苗使用的工具却是林业方面所特有的，如果使用锹、镐则需工太多。有些树种的播种虽然可以利用农业播种工具，但由于育苗与农作物的播种方式不尽相同，也不能全部利用。因此在这两项作业中利用改良工具，对节省劳力和提高育苗质量都具有重大意义。现介绍几种掘苗、整地除草和播种工具供各地参考。
    播种滚筒适用于播种小粒种子，比手播种能提高效率四到五倍，而且播得匀，节省种子。它的构造简单，很多地区都有制造。制法一般是将开好排种孔的白铁皮包卷在两块圆木板上（也有完全用白铁皮的），在板上开一装种口，成一滚筒。各筒以木轴串联，在轴上安装手推把。
    三刃镐是黑龙江省勃利县通天沟森林经营所改良的先进工具。适用于造林前的整地及幼林中耕除草。因镐改为半椭圆形，三面都有刃，这样就省力，也提高了工作效率。一人一天可开二百至三百穴。
    直播造林器是播种马尾松种子和其它适宜于直播造林的各种中小粒林木种子的先进工具，它构造简单，成本低，使用方便，效率高，开穴播种可一次完成。其构造主要是由种子筒，排种管，开穴铲，排种装置（手提或脚踏）和丁字杆等组成。除开穴铲用锻铁，排种管用铁皮制成外。其它都可用竹筒和木料制，全长一公尺。
    这种犁是湖南省林业厅创造的，犁头呈燕翅状，前面有牵引杆，犁头入土的角度可以调整。它适用于南方掘取针叶树及浅根性阔叶树的小苗，并且还可用它进行松土或耕地，一人一牛一天可掘苗五亩，比用锹、镐掘苗提高效率十倍。（附图片）
