Introducing Coal Washing and Coking Experiences

	"Red Flag" Simple Coke Oven
		Engineer of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Zhang Wanqiang
    I. The Characteristics and Development Significance of the Red Flag Coke Oven
    The Red Flag simple coke oven is a new type of furnace that combines indigenous and foreign methods. This coke oven has the advantages of earthen coke ovens, such as low investment, rapid construction, simple equipment, ability to use local materials, flexibility, and ease of operation. It also incorporates the indirect heating method and gas treatment process of foreign coke ovens. Therefore, the coke yield is higher than that of ordinary earthen furnaces (70% to 73%), and the ash content of the coke is also lower than that of earthen furnaces using the same raw materials (1% to 3%). Moreover, because the temperature distribution is relatively uniform, the produced coke has good caking properties, consistent size, and relatively uniform porosity, which is very beneficial to the normal operation of blast furnaces and increased pig iron production. The tar recovery rate can reach about 2% to 3%, and benzene, which cannot be produced by earthen coke ovens, can also be collected.
    The production method of earthen coke ovens is intermittent. Each time coke is produced, from loading coal to discharging coke, it generally takes about ten days for a kiln with a coal loading capacity of about fifty tons, and each kiln can only cycle three to four times per month. The production operation of the Red Flag coke oven is continuous. According to design and production conditions, the cycle time of one furnace chamber is only twenty-four to twenty-six hours. Now, the Coking Refractory Design Institute has narrowed the width of the furnace chamber, and the coking time can be greatly shortened.
    Although the investment in building earthen coke ovens is less than that of Red Flag coke ovens, the consumption of materials and ignition fuel in production is relatively high, and the lifespan is relatively short. Although the Red Flag coke oven is a new design, there is no historical data to check its service life. Because it is made of clay bricks, it is less affected by temperature changes during production and is not damaged by cold water quenching. If attention is paid to maintenance, it is estimated that it can be used for two to three years without any problems.
    The Red Flag coke oven is not restricted by furnace building materials, mechanical equipment, technical conditions, etc., like foreign coke ovens. It can select furnace building materials and power sources according to local conditions. Its furnace body is built with clay bricks and ordinary red bricks, requiring only one suction machine and two water pumps, with very little steel consumption. If there are no steel materials, diesel drums, bricks, and earthenware pipes can be used instead. In areas without electricity, gas engines, diesel engines, or locomobiles can be used as power sources, and the fuel for these machines can be completely self-sufficient without the need for external purchases. This type of coke oven does not require much water, and ordinary earthen wells can be dug to meet the needs in areas without rivers or other water sources. Because the brick type is simpler than that of foreign coke ovens, the furnace building technology is simple. Generally, bricklayers who can build houses can be competent for the furnace building work with technical guidance. This determines that it is entirely possible to build this simple coke oven on a large scale in a short period.
    A small Red Flag coke oven with an annual output of six to seven thousand tons of coke can meet the ironmaking needs of a thirteen cubic meter or slightly larger blast furnace. If cheap materials can be fully utilized, the capital construction investment will not exceed 30,000 yuan at most, which can be recovered from the chemical products produced in less than half a year. It only takes about fifteen days to build such a small coke oven. Because there are no complex machines, the operation is relatively simple, and production workers do not need to have a high level of education or technical skills. Generally speaking, they can master the post operation after short-term training and on-site practice.
    Considering the above characteristics, as long as there is coal that can be coked and there are people, it can be quickly developed. The investment is small, and the results are rapid. It can produce coke suitable for metallurgical requirements and recover valuable chemical products. While promoting a greater leap forward in the steel industry, it also promotes the development of other related industries and agriculture. More importantly, it not only produces coke but also trains people, providing the most important condition for the future industrial development route from small to large and from indigenous to foreign - the condition of people. Therefore, vigorously developing the Red Flag simple coke oven is not only an important guarantee for completing this year's 18 million tons of steel, but also a positive measure to adapt to the increasingly high leap-forward development situation in the coming years, which has great practical significance in the upsurge of socialist economic construction in our country.
    II. Several Points for Attention
    Under the current conditions and situation, vigorously developing simple coke ovens is a relatively ideal goal to strive for. How can we do a good job and give greater play to the advantages of the Red Flag coke oven? I think we should pay attention to the following points:
    1. The Red Flag coke oven is a simple coke oven. The so-called simplicity only refers to the brick type, structure, equipment, material selection, construction, operation, etc., and not that the material performance can be careless, the construction quality can be casual, the raw materials have no conditions, and the operation can be let loose. On the contrary, precisely because of its simplicity, special attention must be paid to the above aspects. Furnace building materials must meet the requirements in terms of physical properties, construction must ensure quality, the joints must be tight and airtight, raw materials must be supplied according to the requirements of the coke oven, and technical management and equipment maintenance must be strengthened.
    2. The suction machine (fan), cooling water, and power are the three major keys to ensuring normal production. Therefore, the suction machine must be configured according to the design requirements, and must not be pieced together at will. Although the amount of cooling water is not large, it must meet the needs. The power only needs to be uninterrupted and guaranteed. It is best to configure a locomobile or gas engine as a backup power source to prevent power outages from affecting production.
    3. In production operations, in addition to guiding ideology, there is also technology. The Red Flag coke oven is still a new thing in various places, and generally speaking, there is a lack of technical personnel. Therefore, training technical forces, especially technical backbones, has become a top priority.
    4. Plant construction should choose places with good raw material bases and transportation conditions.
    5. Raw coal is the key to determining the quality of coke and ensuring normal production. Coal with too high ash content not only damages the quality of coke and affects blast furnace production, but also easily causes difficulties in coke discharging. High moisture content easily lowers the furnace temperature and prolongs the coking time. Therefore, the ash content of raw coal should preferably not exceed 10%, and the moisture content should not be greater than 8%.
    6. The gas system must ensure that the pipelines are airtight and unobstructed, establish a regular cleaning system, and strictly control the temperature and pressure at each location according to the regulations.
    7. Fireworks are strictly prohibited in the chemical product recovery section.

    The Red Flag No. 2 has many advantages and currently meets the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical." It is hoped that all localities will vigorously promote it. While vigorously developing the Red Flag coke oven, do not relax on earthen furnaces, especially several types of earthen coke ovens recommended by the Metallurgical Industry's Iron and Steel Research Institute that have good effects and are suitable for local raw material conditions and workers' production habits.
    The Red Flag coke oven has a short history. Although it has been revised several times, it still has many shortcomings. It is hoped that all localities will provide improvement suggestions based on the usage situation in order to gradually improve it. (Attached picture)

专栏：洗煤炼焦经验介绍

   “红旗”简易炼焦炉
     冶金工业部工程师　张挽强
    一、红旗焦炉的特点和发展红旗焦炉的意义
    红旗简易炼焦炉是土洋结合的一种新炉型，这种焦炉既具有土焦炉投资少、建设快、装备简单、能够就地取材、灵活、易办等等优点，又吸收了洋焦炉的间接加热方法和煤气处理过程，因而出焦率比一般土炉高（70％至73％），焦炭灰分也比用同样原料的土炉低（1％至3％）。并且因为温度分布比较均匀，生产的焦炭熔结良好，块度一致，气孔也较为均匀，对高炉正常操作，增产生铁有很大好处。焦油回收率可达2％至3％左右，另外还能采收土焦炉不能生产的苯类。
    土焦炉生产方法是间歇的，每炼一炉焦炭，从装煤到出焦，一般装煤量五十吨左右的窑需要十天上下，每窑每月只能周转三至四次。红旗焦炉生产操作则是连续的，根据设计及生产情况，一个炉室周转期只二十四至二十六小时，现在焦化耐火设计院将炉室宽度改窄些，结焦时间还可以大大缩短。
    土焦炉建炉投资虽比红旗焦炉少，但在生产中消耗的材料和引火燃料比较多，寿命比较短。红旗焦炉虽然是新的设计，使用年限还无历史材料可查，因为它是粘土砖砌成的，在生产过程中对温度变化的影响小，又不受冷水泼激的伤害，再能注意维护，估计使用二至三年是没有问题的。
    红旗焦炉不像洋焦炉那样受筑炉材料、机械装备、技术条件等等限制，可因地制宜地选用筑炉材料和动力。它的炉体是粘土砖和普通红砖砌筑的，只要一台吸气机，二台水泵，钢铁用量很少。如果没有钢铁材料，还可用柴油桶、砖、缸瓦管来代替。在没有电的地方，可用煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机作动力，而这些机器的燃料完全可以自给，不需外购。这种焦炉用水不多，在无河流或其它水源的地方，挖掘普通的土井即可满足需要。筑炉技术因为砖型较洋焦炉简单，一般能筑民房的泥瓦工人在有技术指导的情况下就可以胜任砌炉工作。这就决定了在短时间内完全有可能大搞这种简易焦炉。
    一座年产六至七千吨焦炭的小红旗炼焦炉可以满足一个十三立方公尺或稍大一点高炉的炼铁需要。如能充分利用廉价材料，基建投资最多不超过三万元，不到半年就可以从生产出来的化学产品中收回。修建一座这样小焦炉只需十五天左右的时间。因为没有复杂的机械，操作比较简易，生产工人不需要有多高的文化水平和技术水平，一般说来，经过短期训练和现场实习，便可以掌握岗位操作。
    综合以上这些特点，只要有了能够炼焦的煤，又有了人，就可以很快搞起来。投资不多，收效迅速，既能生产适合冶金要求的焦炭，又能收回珍贵的化学产品；在促进钢铁更大跃进的同时，也促进了其它有关工业和农业的发展。更重要的是既炼焦又炼人，为今后由小到大、由土到洋的工业发展路线提供了最重要的条件——人的条件。因此，大力发展红旗简易焦炉，不单单是完成今年一千八百万吨钢的重要保证，也是适应今后若干年一节比一节高的飞跃发展形势的积极措施，在我国社会主义经济建设大跃进的高潮中具有重大的现实意义。
    二、几点注意事项
    在目前的条件和形势下，大搞简易炼焦炉是比较理想的奋斗目标。怎样才能搞得好，才能更大地发挥红旗焦炉的优越性呢？我认为应该注意以下几件事：
    1、红旗焦炉是简易焦炉。所谓简易只是砖型、结构、装备、取材、施工、操作等等，而不是材料性能可以马马虎虎，施工质量可以随随便便，原料毫无条件，操作可以放任。恰恰相反，正是由于简易，在以上几个方面就更要特别注意。筑炉材料必须在物理性能上满足要求，施工必须保证质量，接合严密，不透气窜气，按焦炉要求供给原料，加强技术管理和设备维护。
    2、吸气机（风机）、冷却水和动力是保证正常生产的三大关键。因此，吸气机一定要按设计要求来配置，切勿随手拼凑。冷却水用量虽然不多，但必须满足需要。动力只要求不间断，有保证就够了。最好配置一台锅驼机或煤气机，作为预备动力，以防遇到停电影响生产。
    3、在生产操作中除指导思想外，就是技术。红旗焦炉在各地还是新事物，一般说来都缺乏技术人材，所以培养技术力量，特别是技术骨干，成为顶重要的问题。
    4、建厂要选择原料基地和交通条件较好的地方。
    5、原料煤是决定焦炭质量和保证正常生产的关键。灰分太高的煤，不但损害焦炭质量，影响高炉生产，并且容易造成出炉困难，水分高既易降低炉温，又要延长结焦时间。所以原料煤的灰分最好不要超过10％，水分不要大于8％。
    6、煤气系统必须保证管道严密，畅通无阻，建立定期清扫制度，按规程严格控制各个位置的温度和压力。
    7、化学产品回收工段严禁烟火。
               ×　×　×
    红旗二号具有许多优点，在目前是符合“多、快、好、省”这一要求的，希望各地大力推广。在大力发展红旗焦炉的同时，也不要放松土炉，特别是冶金部钢铁研究院推荐的几种效果良好适合地方原料条件及工人生产习惯的土焦炉。
    红旗焦炉历史很短，虽然经过几次修改，还有许多缺点，希望各地根据使用情况，提供改进意见，以便逐渐把它修改得更为完善。（附图片）
