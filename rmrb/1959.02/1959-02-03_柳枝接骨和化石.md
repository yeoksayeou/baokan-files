    Willow Branch Bone Setting and Fossils
    Wang Bingzhang, Professor of Beijing Geological Exploration College

    "Willow branch bone setting" is a technique in bone surgery in Chinese medicine. The "ossification" of willow wood after this surgery—the "wood turning into bone"—generally speaking, is the replacement of organic matter by inorganic matter, with calcium phosphate (bone substance) occupying and replacing the space occupied by carbohydrates (wood substance). The replacement of organic matter by inorganic matter is not uncommon in nature. Paleontologists call this process "petrification."

    In Chinese medicine, the “dragon bones,” “stone swallows,” “stone snakes,” “stone cinnamon fungus,” “turquoise,” etc., used in past dynasties, as well as the "multi-bat inkstones" (i.e., "bat stone") and "stone fish" used for recreation are all fossils in paleontology. To illustrate the "petrification" in the formation of fossils, we should first know that the water in nature is not pure. For example, the transparent and colorless water coming out of the tap seems pure, but when it is heated to a certain temperature in a kettle, it becomes turbid white. This is because the calcium bicarbonate originally dissolved in the water decomposes into calcium carbonate, which is insoluble in water (precipitates at the bottom of the kettle and becomes the scale we usually call kettle alkali or water rust), and carbon dioxide, which can escape. In nature, when such water seeps into buried biological remains, the calcium carbonate decomposed from the calcium bicarbonate in the water gradually occupies various parts of the original tissues of the organism due to the decay of organic matter in the organism. This is the "petrification" of the organic parts of biological remains. Some of the inorganic parts in biological remains are calcium phosphate, and some are silicon dioxide. When the infiltrating water contains hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid or nitric acid, calcium phosphate becomes calcium hydrogen phosphate, which is soluble in water; silicon dioxide becomes potassium or sodium silicate, which is soluble in water, in alkaline solutions and flows elsewhere. Therefore, the hard parts of biological remains can also be replaced by other inorganic substances over long periods of time, that is, "petrification." There are other ways of forming fossils, but some fossils with realistic appearance and still preserved internal tissue forms, such as "petrified wood" (the "turquoise" in herbal books) with obvious growth rings and fibers, are formed in the above-mentioned way.

    The "ossification" process of willow branches is likely to be the same or similar to "petrification." About 90% of wood is carbohydrate, and only about 2% is mineral. In bones, minerals (mainly calcium phosphate) account for about 60%, and carbohydrates distributed in the bones in a network account for about 40%. Therefore, in the "ossification" process of willow branches, it is necessary to increase calcium, phosphorus, and hydrogen, and reduce carbon. After the willow branch is broken and peeled, it loses its growth function, and its cellulose gradually decomposes into easily disappearing compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water, and low-carbon hydrocarbons such as methane (marsh gas) when it is not in contact with air. When it is used for bone setting, it is like a bridge between broken bones, its channels serve as pores through which blood flows, and the disappearance of the gases it decomposes promotes blood circulation, and at the same time frees up space for various materials (i.e., minerals and carbohydrates) from the blood. A relative increase and decrease relationship occurs between the old (i.e., wood) and the new (i.e., bone): carbon is reduced in the old, and calcium, phosphorus, and hydrogen are increased in the new. Even if the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the old are still retained, their arrangement is changed to become the organic matter in the new bone. The newly added calcium and phosphorus gradually become calcium phosphate, and carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., become various carbohydrates in the bone, and the willow branch turns into bone without leaving any trace.

    柳枝接骨和化石
    北京地质勘探学院教授　王炳章
    “柳枝接骨”是我国医学骨科中的一种技术。在这一手术后的“木头变成骨头”——柳木的“骨化”，概括地说，是有机质被无机质所代换，是磷酸钙（骨质）占据和代替了碳水化合物（木质）所占的空间。有机质被无机质所代换的事实在自然界里并不少见，古生物学者把这一过程称为“石化”。
    在我国历代所用药物中的“龙骨”、“石燕”、“石蛇”、“石桂芝”、“松石”等以及文玩中的“多蝠砚”（即“蝙蝠石”），“石鱼”等都是古生物学里的化石。为了说明化石形成方式中的“石化”，我们应该先知道自然界里的水都不是纯净的。例如从自来水管里出来的透明无色的水像是纯净的吧，但当它在壶里受热到一定温度时就显得浊白。这因为原来溶解在水里的碳酸氢钙分解成了不溶于水的碳酸钙（沉淀在壶底上就成了平常说的壶碱或水锈）和能飞逸的二氧化碳。在大自然里，当这样的水渗透在被埋没的生物遗体里去的时候，由于生物体内有机质腐烂而形成的空间，水里的碳酸氢钙分解出来的碳酸钙就逐步地占据了生物体原有组织中的各部位。这就是生物遗体中的有机部分的“石化”。生物遗体中的无机部分，有的是磷酸钙，有的是二氧化矽。当渗透水里含有盐酸或硫酸或硝酸的时候，磷酸钙就变成溶于水的磷酸氢钙；二氧化矽又在碱性溶液里变成溶于水的矽酸钾或钠后流到别处去。因此，生物遗体内的坚硬部分也能在久远的年代里被另种无机质所代替，也就是“石化”了。化石的形成还有其他的方式，但外貌逼真而内部组织形式也依然保存的一些化石如年轮和纤维都很明显的“木化石”（本草书里的“松石”）就是成于上述的这一方式了。
    柳枝的“骨化”过程很可能是和“石化”相同或相似。木质的90％几是碳水化合物，矿物质才占2％左右，在骨头里，矿物质（以磷酸钙为主）约占60％，以网脉状分布在骨头里的碳水化合物约占40％，所以在柳枝的“骨化”过程中需要增加钙、磷、氢，而减少碳。柳枝被折断并去皮之后，它就失掉了生长机能，它的纤维素在不和空气接触时就渐渐分解成二氧化碳、一氧化碳、水和低碳的碳氢化合物如甲烷（沼气）等等容易消逝的化合物。当它被用来接骨后，就好像断骨之间的桥梁一样，它的管道充作贯通桥头血液的孔道，它所分解出的气体的消逝就促进了血液的流通，同时也就为从血液里来的各种各样的资料（即矿物质和碳水化合物）腾出了空间，而旧（即木头）与新（即骨头）之间发生了相对的消长关系：在旧物里消减了碳，在新物里增加了钙、磷和氢，即使旧物里的碳、氢、氧仍有被保留的，但它们的排列方式经过改变也就成为新骨里的有机质了。而新增的钙和磷逐渐变成磷酸钙，碳、氢、氧等成为骨内的各种碳水化合物后，柳枝就变成了骨头而不留下任何痕迹了。
