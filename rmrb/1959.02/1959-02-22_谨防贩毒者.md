　　Recently, the Tito group in Yugoslavia has been particularly enthusiastic in promoting their so-called "active coexistence" and "non-alignment" policies. The Belgrade newspaper "Borba" stated that the "active coexistence" policy is "a meaningful factor in international life" and "a brilliant page." The Yugoslav "League of Communists" organ "Komunist" said that the "active coexistence" policy "basically reflects the general goals of mankind and has become an indispensable need of the modern world" because it "powerfully and practically negates those exclusive group plans and the theory that various nations and countries can only survive as members of one group or another, under the protection of one ally or another."
　　It seems that the Tito group is only concerned with self-aggrandizement and has forgotten the entire world, including their own actual position. Indeed, there are currently groups in the world that are not only exclusive but also aggressive, namely the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact, all created by U.S. imperialism. But which of these has the Tito group's "active coexistence" policy "negated"? Not only has it not negated any of them, but on the contrary, Yugoslavia itself is a member of the Balkan Group, and the other two members of this group, Turkey and Greece, have both joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Turkey has also joined the Baghdad Pact. In fact, from the day it was established, the Balkan Group has been a tool for imperialism to carry out anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-peace activities. In the past, although there was a period when the group was paralyzed due to disputes between Turkey and Greece over the Cyprus issue, according to Western news agencies, the Balkan Group has recently been busy reorganizing. On February 13, Konchi, a spokesperson for the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, also acknowledged this fact. On the same day, the "Indian Times" correspondent in London reported that the United States and Britain urgently felt the need for reconciliation between Greece and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, "thereby paving the way for the early restoration of the Balkan Treaty, so that Yugoslavia can once again participate in the Western military bloc against the Soviet Union." This is the real intention of the imperialists, and it is a fact that Yugoslavia wants to conceal as much as possible.
　　In fact, apart from Yugoslavia's participation in the Balkan Group, there are a large number of facts proving that the Tito group's so-called "active coexistence" and "non-alignment" policies are completely different in nature from the peaceful neutrality policies of many newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. The peaceful neutrality policies implemented by many newly independent countries in Asia and Africa are based on the principles of peaceful coexistence of the Bandung Conference and are in line with the interests of these countries and world peace. The Tito group, on the other hand, has sold itself to imperialism, putting rouge and powder on imperialism, and serving imperialism. What is this called a "non-alignment" policy? The Tito group maliciously slanders the Soviet Union, attacks China, opposes the socialist camp, and undermines the unity of the countries of the socialist camp. What is this called "active coexistence"? In fact, the Tito group's actions precisely prove that whoever stands on the position of resolutely opposing the Soviet Union and the socialist camp cannot simultaneously oppose imperialism, and therefore cannot be truly neutral. The Tito group is not only not engaged in socialism, nor is it engaged in peaceful neutrality, but is acting as a special detachment of imperialism, trying to sneak into the socialist movement and the national independence movement to do bad things. It sows discord in the unity of the socialist camp, sows discord between the socialist camp and the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa, and sows discord within and among the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa. Imperialism greatly appreciates these actions of the Tito group and has given it a large amount of material and political rewards for this. Not long ago, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly praised the "heroism" shown by the Tito group. Was this accidental?
　　The Tito group has recently been particularly enthusiastic in promoting their so-called "active coexistence" and "non-alignment" policies, and wants to establish a so-called "third group" under this guise. This is a major political conspiracy, the main purpose of which is to undermine the friendly relations between many nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa and socialist countries, thereby undermining the national independence movement throughout the Asia-Africa region. Countless facts in the past and present prove that the friendly unity between socialist countries and nationally independent countries is an important condition for the Asian and African people to strive for freedom and maintain independence. It is precisely because of this that imperialism always tries every possible means to undermine this unity. Now, the Tito group wants to establish a so-called third group and carry out various other activities, which are obviously serving this conspiracy of imperialism. Although the American bosses are very cautious about this open secret, they still inevitably reveal the inside story from time to time.
　　The "Washington Post" said on December 11 last year that the Tito group wanted to organize "a non-aligned group of non-aligned countries" among the neutral countries in Asia, "which may be beneficial in some ways."
　　Judging from the current situation, this thing that the Tito group wants to promote, which is "beneficial" to imperialism, has not been able to find much of a market among Asian and African countries. Not long ago, according to foreign news agencies, Indonesian diplomats pointed out that Indonesia opposes countries that do not assume obligations assuming the obligation to take group action. Sri Lankan Prime Minister Bandaranaike said that he did not approve of the establishment of a so-called third group. The famous Indian political activist Menon also believes that the establishment of a third group does not help stabilize the situation and should definitely not be done. These opinions can illustrate that what the Tito group is promoting is obviously not in line with the fundamental interests of the nationally independent countries of Asia and Africa. It is not difficult for all discerning people to see that the various goods that the Tito group wants to promote contain a large amount of poison.

    谨防贩毒者
    最近一个时期，南斯拉夫的铁托集团正在特别起劲地宣扬他们的所谓“积极共处”和“非集团”政策。贝尔格莱德的“战斗报”说，“积极共处”政策是“国际生活中的一个有意义的因素”和“光辉的一页”。南斯拉夫“共产主义者联盟”机关刊物“共产主义者”说，“积极共处”政策“基本上反映了人类总的目标并且成了现代世界必不可少的需要”，因为它“有力而实际地否定了那些排他性的集团计划以及那种认为各个民族和国家只有作为一个或另一个集团的成员，只有在一个或另一个盟国的保护下才能够生存的理论”。
    看来，铁托集团大概只顾自我吹嘘，而忘掉了整个世界，包括他们自己的实际地位。的确，现在的世界上是存在着不仅是排他性而且是侵略性的集团，那就是美帝国主义所制造的北大西洋公约集团、东南亚条约集团、巴格达条约集团；可是，铁托集团的“积极共处”政策究竟“否定”了这其中的哪一个呢？不但没有否定，恰恰相反，南斯拉夫本身就是巴尔干集团的成员，而这个集团的另外两个成员土耳其和希腊又都参加了北大西洋公约，土耳其还参加了巴格达条约。事实上，巴尔干集团从它建立的一天起，就是帝国主义进行反苏、反共、反和平活动的一个工具。过去，虽然有过一个时期，由于土耳其和希腊在塞浦路斯问题上的纠纷而使这个集团陷于瘫痪，但是据西方通讯社报道，最近以来巴尔干集团又正在忙于重整旗鼓了。2月13日，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人孔奇也承认了这个事实。同一天，“印度时报”驻伦敦记者报道说，美英迫切感到希腊和土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上有必要实行和解，“从而铺平道路，能够及早恢复巴尔干条约，以便使南斯拉夫再一次参加对付苏联的西方军事集团”。这就是帝国主义者的真正打算，这也是南斯拉夫想要极力掩盖的一个事实。
    其实，除了南斯拉夫参加巴尔干集团这件事以外，有大量的事实证明铁托集团的所谓“积极共处”和“非集团”政策同亚非许多新独立国家的和平中立政策，完全是性质不同的两个东西。亚非许多新独立国家所实行的和平中立政策，是以万隆会议的和平共处的各项原则为基础的，是符合这些国家和世界和平的利益的。而铁托集团则是卖身投靠帝国主义，给帝国主义搽胭涂粉，替帝国主义效劳，这叫做什么“非集团”政策呢？铁托集团恶毒地污蔑苏联，攻击中国，反对社会主义阵营，破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结，这叫做什么“积极共处”呢？事实上，铁托集团的行动恰好证明了，谁要是站在坚决敌视苏联和社会主义阵营的立场上，谁就不可能同时反对帝国主义，因而也就不可能真正中立。铁托集团不但不是搞社会主义的，也不是搞和平中立的，而是充当帝国主义的别动队，想钻到社会主义运动和民族独立运动的内部来干坏事情。挑拨社会主义阵营的团结，挑拨社会主义阵营和亚非新独立国家之间的团结，挑拨亚非新独立国家内部和相互间的团结。帝国主义是非常赏识铁托集团的这些作为的，为此曾大量地给予物质的和政治的奖励。不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开赞扬了铁托集团所表现的“英勇”，难道是偶然的吗？
    铁托集团最近期间特别起劲地宣扬他们的所谓“积极共处”和“非集团”政策，并且想在这个幌子下建立所谓“第三集团”。这是一个重大的政治阴谋，其主要目的就是为了破坏亚非许多民族独立国家同社会主义各国的友好关系，从而损害整个亚非地区的民族独立运动。过去和现在的无数事实证明，社会主义各国同民族独立国家的友好团结，是亚非人民争取自由和维护独立的重要条件。正是因为这样，帝国主义总是千方百计地破坏这种团结。现在，铁托集团想要建立所谓第三集团和进行其他种种活动，显然就是为帝国主义的这种阴谋服务的。对于这个公开的秘密，美国老板们虽然十分谨慎，但是有的时候仍不免泄露了内情。
  “华盛顿邮报”在去年12月11日说，铁托集团要在亚洲中立国家中间组织“一个非集团的集团”，“在某些方面来说，它可能是有好处的”。
    从现有的情况看来，铁托集团要推销的这种对帝国主义“有好处”的东西，并没有能够在亚非国家中间找到多少市场。不久以前，据外国通讯社报道，印度尼西亚外交人士曾指出，印度尼西亚反对不承担义务国家承担采取集团行动的义务。锡兰总理班达拉奈克曾说，他不赞成建立所谓第三集团。印度著名政治活动家梅农也认为，建立第三集团无助于局势的稳定，绝对不应该去做。这些意见可以说明，铁托集团所宣扬的东西，显然是不符合亚非民族独立国家的根本利益的。一切有见识的人士都不难看出，铁托集团所要推销的种种货色，是包含着大量毒质的。
