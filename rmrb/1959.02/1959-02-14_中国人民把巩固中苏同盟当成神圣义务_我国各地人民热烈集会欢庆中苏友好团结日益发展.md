    Shanghai Xinhua News Agency, February 13th. The Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand celebration tonight to mark the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. More than 1,000 people, including responsible individuals from the Shanghai Party, government, and military, and representatives from all sectors of society, attended the celebration. Staff members of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, Soviet experts assisting in China's construction, and staff members and experts from the consulates of various socialist countries in Shanghai were also invited to attend the celebration.

    Chen Pixian, Vice President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. First, on behalf of the people of Shanghai, he warmly congratulated the great victory of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, congratulated the Soviet people on their more brilliant achievements in the great cause of communist construction, and congratulated the further consolidation and development of the friendly alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people. Chen Pixian expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet experts in Shanghai for their comprehensive and selfless assistance in China's socialist construction. He especially mentioned the agreement on further expanding economic cooperation signed by China and the Soviet Union on February 7th, pointing out that this is a new and important link in further strengthening and expanding the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Chen Pixian emphasized that the unity between China and the Soviet Union is the strongest fortress of the socialist camp and the strongest fortress of world peace. The people of our country, like the Soviet people, cherish Sino-Soviet friendship and unity as they cherish their own eyes. The great friendship and unity between our two countries will never fade and will last forever.

    Yelin, Deputy Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting. He described the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in the process of building socialism and communism and defending world peace, as well as the magnificent seven-year plan discussed and adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that the facts of the past nine years have proved that the alliance, cooperation, and unity between the Soviet Union and China are the main guarantees for the victorious construction of socialism and communism in our two countries, and also an insurmountable obstacle to preventing the imperialist camp headed by the United States from launching a new world war. Yelin said: The US imperialists and Yugoslav revisionists are trying to arouse suspicion among socialist countries and attempt to split and weaken socialist countries. Let the imperialists and modern revisionists daydream! The people of China and the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp will certainly unite forever and march towards the peak of communism with majestic and orderly steps. Many wonderful cultural performances were also performed at the celebration.

What makes us even more excited and inspired is the success of the recent 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
