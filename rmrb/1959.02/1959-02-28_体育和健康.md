    Sports and Health
    Zhang Rongquan
    Wild rabbits often have to escape the pursuit of wild beasts, and are agile in their movements; however, a domestic rabbit that has been raised in a cage since childhood, no matter how fat and strong it is, may die suddenly if frightened into a burst of intense running and jumping. If the hearts of a wild rabbit and a domestic rabbit of equal weight are dissected and compared, it will be found that the heart of the wild rabbit is more than three times larger than that of the domestic rabbit. The domestic rabbit's weak heart, of course, cannot withstand strenuous exercise. The organs of a living thing develop through regular use, and deteriorate through long-term disuse.
    Humans are no exception. With the development of society, the division of labor becomes more detailed, and physical activity becomes more limited. Those who use their brains often do not use their hands, and those who use their hands may not use their legs, so the full functions of the body are not brought into play. The potential of the human body's internal organs is great. A healthy adult's heart can output more than forty liters of blood per minute at its maximum workload. However, when we work calmly every day, the heart only needs to output about four liters of blood per minute to meet the needs of the whole body, so the heart's work is often slow and easy. The average adult's vital capacity is about 3,500 milliliters, but when we work calmly every day, the lungs only need to inhale about 500 milliliters of air each time to meet the needs of the body, so most of the alveoli are in a state of rest, and only a small part is constantly working. Over time, the parts that are not functioning will gradually degenerate, and those organs that are frequently used may also develop abnormally. Therefore, people who do not like to move and lack physical exercise often become weaker. Intellectuals often shrug their shoulders and have no strength to truss a chicken; some manual laborers who perform local limb operations may also develop bowlegs, hunchbacks and other occupational diseases.
    Sports is a science that comprehensively develops human body functions. Through systematic and regular physical activities, it enables all parts of the body to be fully exercised, not only preventing atrophy and degeneration, but also developing and strengthening them.
    All human movements are accomplished through muscle contraction. During physical exercise, the body strengthens its activities, and the muscles contract frequently, which requires the supply of more nutrients (mainly carbohydrates) and oxygen, and the energy for activities is generated through their oxidation. At the same time, the waste products produced after muscle activity (mainly lactic acid, which is later broken down into carbon dioxide and water) also need to be excreted quickly. Therefore, the various physiological systems have to work hard: the heart has to speed up its contractions to speed up blood circulation in order to transport nutrients and remove waste products. The lungs breathe deeply and rapidly to absorb more oxygen for the muscles to carry out oxidation. All muscle activities are directed by the central nervous system, especially many sports such as ball games, which require people to be extremely resourceful and flexible in order to adapt to the ever-changing situation, which can make the function of the nervous system more perfect and the response more sensitive. As a result of such regular exercise, the muscles become thicker because they receive ample nutrients, the fibers become thicker, the contractions become greater, and they can handle more important work. The bones are strong and can firmly support the body. The heart becomes thicker and stronger, and can transport more blood. The lungs also expand and can breathe more air. Since the entire organism is unified, the enhancement of the functions of these organs will inevitably promote the enhancement of the functions of the digestive system, excretory system, hematopoietic organs, and metabolism, making the body have strong resistance to disease, vigorous vitality, and not easy to age. With such a physique, labor is of course efficient, and one can work for a long time without feeling tired.
    In the face of the great and arduous tasks of socialist construction, let us all participate in sports regularly and train ourselves to become laborers with strong physiques!

    体育和健康

    山兔经常要逃避猛兽追捕，行踪狡捷；但是，一只从小就养在笼子里长大的家兔，不管养得多么肥壮，只要吓唬它作一阵猛烈的跑跳，就有猝然死亡的可能。如果把体重相等的山兔和家兔的心脏剖出一比，就会发现山兔的心脏比家兔大三倍多。家兔这样柔弱的心脏，当然经受不住剧烈运动。生物的器官经常运用就有进展，长期废弃就会衰退。
    人类也不例外。随着社会的发展，劳动分工愈细，身体活动愈受局限。用脑的往往不动手，动手的可能不动腿，都没有发挥身体的全部机能的作用。人体内脏器官功能的潜力很大。一个健康的成年人，心脏每分钟的最大工作量，能输出四十多公升血液。但是我们日常平静工作时，心脏每分钟只要输出大约四公升血液就能供全身需要了，因而心脏的工作经常是缓慢轻松的。一般成年人的肺活量大约是三千五百毫升，但是我们日常平静工作时，肺脏每次大约只吸入空气五百毫升就能供身体需要了，因而大部分肺泡是处于休止状态，只有一小部分经常进行工作。长此下去，那没有起作用的部分就会逐渐衰退，而那些经常运用的器官，也有畸形发展的可能。所以往往一些不爱活动和缺乏体育锻炼的人身体日趋衰弱。知识分子往往耸肩含胸、手无缚鸡之力；有些局部肢体操劳的体力等劳动者也会出现罗圈腿、驼背等职业病。
    体育运动就是全面发展人体机能的一门科学。它通过系统的、规律的身体活动，使各部器官得到全面锻炼，不仅不致萎缩衰退，而且更加发展强大。
    人体的一切动作，都是通过肌肉收缩来完成的。体育锻炼时，身体加强活动，各部肌肉收缩频繁，就需要供应更多的营养物质（主要是醣类）和氧，通过它们的氧化作用产生活动的能量。同时，肌肉活动后产生的废物（主要是乳酸，后来又分解成二氧化碳和水），也需要很快排出。因此，各个生理系统就不得不紧张地工作：心脏要加快收缩，使血液循环加快，以便运送养分和排除废物。肺脏呼吸变得又深又急，以便吸收更多的氧供肌肉进行氧化作用。一切肌肉活动，都是由中枢神经指挥的，特别是许多运动项目如球类等要求人们极其机智、灵活，才能适应千变万化的情况，就能使神经系统的机能锻炼得更完善，反应得更灵敏。这样经常锻炼的结果，肌肉因为得到了充裕的养分，纤维变粗，收缩更大，就能操持更重大的工作。骨胳粗壮，能牢固地支持身体。心脏变得厚实强大，能输送更多的血液。肺脏也扩展了，能呼吸更多的空气。由于整个有机体是统一的，这些器官功能的增强，也必然促进消化系统、排泄系统、造血器官以及新陈代谢等功能的增强，使身体对疾病具有强大的抵抗力，生命力旺盛，不易衰老。这样的体质，劳动起来当然效率高，能持久工作而不知疲倦。
    在社会主义建设的宏伟而又艰巨的任务面前，让我们大家都经常参加体育运动，锻炼成为体质坚强的劳动者吧！
