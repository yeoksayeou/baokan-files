Seizing Ore
	Guarding the Mountain Day and Night, Sleeping with the Mountain at Night
	Daye Miners Battle at Tieshan

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 2nd: The miners of Daye Tieshan are actively preparing "grain" for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO). Building on the foundation of "simultaneous leaps in targets and all-around production success" last year, they overfulfilled the mining plan by 31% and the stripping plan by 3% in January this year.

Daye Tieshan employs fully mechanized open-pit mining, using drilling machines for blasting, electric shovels for loading, and electric trains and trucks for transportation. According to the original plan, it was to be put into production in 1960. However, to ensure WISCO's blast furnaces produced iron ahead of schedule, mining began ahead of schedule in July last year. Since then, the Party Secretary and the Mine Director have personally gone up the mountain to "cultivate experimental plots." All employees have also put forward the slogan of "guarding the mountain by day and night, sleeping with the mountain at night," persisting on the mountain day and night to solve the problems of improving mining efficiency and supplying ore ahead of schedule. Drilling machine workers first discovered a series of tricks to prevent slag from blocking holes, improve slag removal efficiency, and reduce non-drilling time, which greatly improved the efficiency of drilling machines. Subsequently, the electric shovel work section also organized veteran workers to demonstrate operations, teaching everyone the experience of "separating ore from rock" and replacing the shovel bucket from three cubic meters to four cubic meters, which increased the monthly loading capacity of electric shovels from more than 44,000 cubic meters to more than 55,000 cubic meters. With the courageous labor of all employees, Jianshan and Shizishan in Daye Iron Mine were cut down by twenty-four meters and fifty-two meters respectively last year, and 1.21 million tons of iron ore were mined.

This year, the employees of Daye Tieshan have decided to complete even greater stripping and mining tasks with greater enthusiasm, preparing ample "grain" for WISCO. Currently, employees are engaged in a fierce battle to address the key problems existing in various production links.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 2nd: The railway from Daye Tieshan to Lingxiang Iron Mine was completed at the end of January. This railway is thirty-one kilometers long and is specially designed for transporting iron ore for WISCO.

Lingxiang Iron Mine is located in the southwest of Daye Tieshan. The ore is largely exposed on the ground and is of excellent grade. This year, it will provide WISCO with 1.6 million tons of iron ore. This iron ore will pass through Tieshan and then be transported to WISCO via the Wu(chang)-Da(ye) railway.

### 抓矿石  日守山岗吃　夜伴山岗眠  大冶矿工铁山鏖战

    抓矿石
    日守山岗吃　夜伴山岗眠
    大冶矿工铁山鏖战
    新华社武汉2日电　大冶铁山的矿工们正在积极地为武钢备“粮”。在去年“指标齐飞跃，生产满堂红”的基础上，今年1月份，他们又超额31％完成了采矿计划，超额3％完成了剥离计划。
    大冶铁山由穿孔机打眼爆破，电铲装车，电气火车和汽车载运，全部是机械化露天开采；按照原订计划，它要在1960年投入生产，但是为了保证武钢高炉提前出铁，也提前在去年7月就开始采矿。从那时起，党委书记和矿长都亲自上山“种试验田”，全体职工也提出“日守山岗吃，夜伴山岗眠”的口号，日夜坚持在山上，解决提高采掘效率和提前供应矿石的问题。穿孔机工人们首先在防止浮渣堵眼、提高出渣效率和减少非钻进时间等方面，找出了一系列窍门，使穿孔机的工作效率飞跃提高。接着，电铲工段也组织老工人示范操作，向大家传授“矿岩分铲”的经验，并且将铲斗由三立方公尺改为四立方公尺，使电铲每月的装车能力由四万四千多立方公尺上升到五万五千多立方公尺。在全体职工的奋勇劳动下，大冶铁矿的尖山和狮子山，去年被分别削去了二十四公尺和五十二公尺，采出了铁矿石一百二十一万吨。
    今年，大冶铁山的职工们决定以更大的干劲，完成更大的剥离和采掘的任务，给武钢备好“粮”。目前职工们正在向各个生产环节上存在的关键问题展开奋战。
    据新华社武汉2日电　大冶铁山通往灵乡铁矿的铁路在1月底建成。这条铁路长三十一公里，是专门为武钢运输铁矿石的。
    灵乡铁矿位于大冶铁山西南部，矿石大片裸露地面，品位很好。它今年将为武钢提供一百六十万吨铁矿石；这些铁矿石将经过铁山，再由武（昌）大（冶）铁路送往武钢。
