Xinhua News Agency, 6th. According to the Soviet "Pravda," Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the afternoon of January 28. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

    Comrades! On behalf of the French Communist Party and its Central Committee, the French working class and working people, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the glorious 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is being held in an atmosphere of inspiring victory. (Applause)

    The achievements of the Soviet Union in developing industry and agriculture, developing education, science and technology, have universally aroused great excitement among the working people of all countries. All progressive people are cheering for the achievements of the Soviet Union and believe that the achievements of the Soviet Union are victories of world significance. The Soviet Union is rapidly advancing towards the future, powerfully demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system.

    Soviet scientists, technicians, and workers launched a new planet orbiting the sun, turning one of mankind's boldest fantasies into reality. This demonstrates new achievements in science and technology. At the same time, they also show the powerful creative power of socialism, which opens up bright prospects for the future of mankind.

    The balance of power has changed in favor of the world socialist system. The Soviet Union is a powerful country. People's China is also powerful. Other fraternal socialist countries that are close and intimate are also strong. These forces and this unity are the guarantee of peace for the people of all countries. (Applause)

    The resolution of the 21st Congress on the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will advance the arrival of a historical moment. At that time, the Soviet Union, which is at the forefront of socialist countries, will rank first in the world in all indicators, including improving the material welfare of the masses. In this way, the Soviet Union will prove to millions of people around the world that socialism is in line with their interests. (Applause)

    We express our warm congratulations and gratitude to the great Leninist Party – the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which unswervingly adheres to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet people in preparing and achieving extraordinary victories foreshadowing new victories, as evidenced by the significant report of N.S. Khrushchev. (Applause)

    The sharp contrast between the situation in the Soviet Union and capitalist countries is now becoming increasingly apparent.

    In the Soviet state, we see the vigorous development of socialist democracy. Here, the living standards of the working people are constantly improving, and the prospect of implementing a thirty-five to thirty-hour, five-day work week is becoming increasingly clear.

    In capitalist countries, where economic recession will inevitably lead to fatal consequences, especially in France, the exploitation and impoverishment of the working people are intensifying. Furthermore, it should also be pointed out that the living conditions of the entire urban and rural working residents are deteriorating, democratic freedoms are seriously damaged, and the fascist threat is rising.

    In this difficult environment, our party continues to struggle, closely linking the genuine national interests, which are inseparable from the interests of the people, with the unwavering loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism. (Applause)

    As everyone knows, after the colonialist military and political personnel launched a coup in Algeria on May 13 last year, a government was formed in France on July 1 as a result of this fascist action. If unified action had been taken, this trend could have been prevented. However, the divisive policies of the Socialist Party leaders shattered the intention of the working class to achieve combat unity. As a result, General de Gaulle seized power by taking advantage of the chauvinistic and colonialist sentiments fueled by the right-wing Socialist Party leaders.

    Throughout its entire history, our party has had to wage a cruel struggle against colonialism, the ideological source of chauvinism and racism. Our party has always supported the people who are fighting to free themselves from colonial oppression. When persecuted, it never retreated, and when the masses had some misunderstandings about its policies, it never succumbed. Whenever the situation required it, it did not hesitate to go against the tide.

    The crisis of the colonial system is shaking the French colonial empire. With the advent of the crisis of the colonial system, the anti-colonial struggle has also become complicated. Precisely because of this, in the struggle against the Algerian War, we made every effort to persuade the French working class and the people to recognize the injustice of the colonial war, but we encountered much greater difficulties than in the struggle against the Vietnam War.

    After the general election on January 2, 1956, many French people believed that the Algerian War was about to end. However, the Socialist Party leaders who led the government embarked on a path of continuing the war and used the worst chauvinistic and colonialist arguments to conduct propaganda among a section of the working class and launched the Suez adventure.

    Our party has made great efforts to help the working masses in the Socialist Party to put pressure on their leaders so that they can lay the foundation for peace in Algeria through negotiations. Despite our persistent efforts and repeated proposals, we have never been able to achieve peace through negotiations.

    Just as war-weariness was growing and the idea that negotiations must be held was paving the way for itself, the extreme colonialists in Algeria accelerated the course of events. They staged a coup on May 13 and pretended to celebrate with the local residents. They spread rumors that this celebration marked the end of the Algerian War. However, the Algerian War is still going on.

    This is the result of the policies pursued by the heads of the capitalist monopoly groups. Of course, these people, especially the leaders of the oil monopoly organizations, are primarily interested in developing the rich resources of the Sahara and are therefore very eager to end this war. However, despite the fact that their views differ somewhat from those of the extreme colonialists, the situation has not fundamentally changed until now. The recent amnesty may be an expression of the monopoly capital groups' hope to find a way to break the current situation. But, in the final analysis, the important point is that the government continues to oppose holding negotiations. In fact, the formal refusal to hold any negotiations with the Algerian National Liberation Front on the issue of Algeria's political status will result in nothing but the continuation of the Algerian War. And the Algerian War is increasingly becoming an increasingly bloody war.

    In order to promote its policies, the colonialist and fascist groups entangled the idea of merging Algeria and France with the concept of French dignity.

    In order to answer these sophistries, our party clarifies that the Algerian War is contrary to the true interests of the nation. In fact, this war not only damages France's international prestige, but also damages its economy. In particular, the Algerian War has forced the French government to become more dependent on the United States and to borrow money from Bonn Germany, which requires France to support its foreign policy.

    Facts show that colonialism is beneficial to capitalist monopoly groups, but on the other hand, it leads to war, poverty, reaction, and the loss of national independence for France.

    Indeed, the economic and financial consequences caused by the Algerian War have played a significant role in the agreement reached between the governments of France and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as in the implementation of the agreement on the Common Market. This agreement undoubtedly reflects the attempt to establish a group of countries in the heart of Europe that is commanded by large capitalist monopoly groups and supported by reactionary and dark forces. One of the tasks of this group is to strive to deprive the working people of their social achievements and undermine the democratic system of capitalist countries in Western Europe.

    In addition, the establishment of this alliance at a time when the influence of West German militarists in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has expanded will hinder the solution of the Berlin issue and the German issue, regarding which the Soviet Union has put forward proposals that can be used to obtain solutions that meet the interests of the people of all countries and defend peace.

    The policy towards the Adenauer government that France has already begun to pursue is based on cooperation with those West German militarists who violate the Paris Agreement and demand that the West German army be armed with atomic weapons. The French ruling group not only does not advocate the prohibition of nuclear weapons tests and disarmament (including the reduction of atomic weapons), as required by the interests of our country, but also supports the Bonn General Staff and is preparing to produce atomic bombs itself.

    In this way, the French rulers forget the lessons of history and begin to repeat the anti-Soviet platitudes that once helped the Hitlerites, and are actually catering to the reviving West German militarism.

    The fact that Adenauer has vast funds that can be used to exert pressure on the French government makes the danger to Europe and the world even greater. Therefore, we pay close attention to the development of events in this regard.

    Military expenditures, especially the expenditures for the Algerian War, are a heavy burden on the French working class. Moreover, the economic recession is increasingly shortening the working week and increasing the number of layoffs. In this context, the measures taken by the government to increase the taxes of the working masses are particularly prominent and have aroused fully understandable anxiety.

    The offensive of big capital first strikes the working class, but it also targets other strata of the working people. The offensive also targets small and medium-sized farmers. And it is openly acknowledged that one of the tasks of this offensive is to eliminate nearly 800,000 such farmers. This offensive also targets handicraftsmen and merchants, as well as small and medium-sized business owners, who face a dual threat: the decline in the purchasing power of the working masses and the competition that has emerged since France joined the Common Market.

    The joint declaration of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of the twelve socialist countries, adopted in Moscow in November 1957 and later endorsed by the communist and workers' parties of other countries, pointed out that the contradictions between the monopoly bourgeoisie and the various strata of the people are intensifying. The colonialists and fascists, who are gathered under the banner of de Gaulleism, use civil war to blackmail and intimidate, and have established in France a system of rule in which the parliamentary system is merely a facade, and the National Assembly has become a caricature of popular representation. This is a system that has lost any democratic content and harbors a fascist threat.

    The French bourgeois ruling group, which has always liked to talk about "freedom" and "democracy," has now abandoned the method of parliamentary administration because this method prevents them from implementing their policies of war, poverty, and reaction. This should not be seen as a sign of strength, but as a result of the serious difficulties caused by the deep crisis of the colonial system.

    While the working class believes that it is possible, under certain conditions, to transition to socialism peacefully, including through parliamentary channels, the leaders of monopoly capital have abolished the bourgeois democratic administration method and have more blatantly and tyrannically seized the leadership of state affairs.

    The French situation cannot be viewed in isolation from the situation in Europe. Therefore, it is understandable that the working people and democrats of the countries concerned are united in dealing with the dangers they face.

    As for our party, it clearly recognizes its responsibilities to the French people. It first strives to guide the working class and the strata of residents who are harmed by the policies of war, poverty, and reaction to fight against the monopoly groups that advocate these policies. This is the main task. If this task is not carried out with the necessary perseverance, someone may be able to deceive those who have become victims of the policies of the government manipulated by capitalist monopoly organizations through fascist demagoguery.

    In order to accomplish this task, our party needs to carry out intensive work. In the recent period, our party has resolutely and thoroughly resisted the anti-democratic measures taken by the reactionaries and the lackeys of the fascists. Of course, the illusions stirred up by malicious national propaganda and social propaganda, and spread by organizations and individuals demanding personal power, have not disappeared. But the situation has initially changed.

    If Guy Mollet and other leaders of the Socialist Party withdraw from the government and decide to become an opposition party in form rather than in substance, it will force the workers who participate in the Socialist Party to take another action.

    Obviously, for this reason, the leaders of the Socialist Party are trying to bring the opposition that has emerged within their party into a certain orbit. They will continue to hinder the workers—Socialists and Communists, and even all workers—from achieving the necessary united action.

    This situation requires us to guarantee the united action of the working class with the greatest perseverance, and to combine the actions of the working class with the actions of other strata in the country, so as to fight together against capitalist monopoly organizations. Capitalist monopoly organizations must be isolated and forced to retreat.

    This is the way to stop the Algerian War, raise the people's living standards, achieve the victory of a peaceful policy, and substantially reduce military expenditures.

    Of course, our party is now facing great difficulties, but it will gloriously accomplish the tasks before it in the spirit of unlimited loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. (Applause)

    In the past year, our party has waged a tenacious struggle to block the path of the reactionaries and fascists in implementing the resolutions of its Fourteenth Congress. The correct policy of united working-class action and the solidarity of democratic forces implemented by our party has been supported by party activists and party organizations. The working people and democrats, including many who have been deceived by enemy propaganda, are becoming increasingly clear about the party's policy.

    It can be seen that our party now bears a great responsibility. In order to successfully complete the tasks facing the party, the party must be united, and this requires a relentless struggle against all phenomena that may harm the unity of the party ranks.

    It is in this spirit that we, like other fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties, are fighting against the international revisionist conspiracy and the tendencies of opportunism and capitulationism. These tendencies always find fertile ground during the most difficult and therefore decisive periods of struggle for the future of the workers' movement.

    We believe that it is necessary to wage a strong struggle against revisionism. At the same time, we have not neglected to overcome the narrow sectarian tendencies arising from the characteristics of our struggle. If we do not fight stubbornly against this tendency, it will seriously hinder our efforts to achieve the united action of the working class and democratic forces.

    Our party is solid! It has withstood the test of storms. In the recent elections, it won the votes of nearly four million French men and women citizens. (Applause)

    Now the French people have begun to recognize the situation, and tomorrow they will understand even more clearly that the ruling group has abused their trust and that they have become victims of the ruling group.

    Nothing can make us forget that it is thanks to the French Communist Party that we can explain the true meaning of the events that have occurred and foresee the events that will happen today. The French Communist Party also has enough courage to tell the people the truth and call on the people to unite and fight.

    As for the future, we are fully confident in the French people and in the future of our country. We are constantly strengthening the work of united action, so that we can mobilize the French people to begin a new struggle in order to end the Algerian War by holding negotiations with the Algerians who are fighting for independence and to realize a policy advocating national independence, peace, democratic reform, and social progress.

    Comrades! By participating in your outstanding congress, which demonstrates the unbreakable power of communism, we are even more convinced that the working class and the people's forces will defeat the reactionaries and fascists, and that our cause will surely triumph!

    Delegate comrades! In congratulating you, we want to tell you that we are proud to be communists and soldiers of the great cause. The people of all countries are fighting for this cause with deep faith. Communism—this modern humanism—is the hope and future of all mankind. (Applause)

    Long live the Twenty-First Congress of Communist Builders! (Stormy and lasting applause, all standing)

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is admired and trusted by the world communist movement and the workers' movement! (Applause)

    Long live the Marxist-Leninist unity of the communist and workers' parties! (Applause)

    Long live the invincible doctrine of Marx and Lenin! (Applause)

    Long live communism! (Stormy, sustained applause, all standing)

    法国共产党中央委员会书记
    杜克洛在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道，法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛1月28日下午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上致了贺词，贺词全文如下：
    同志们！我代表法国共产党和它的中央委员会、法国工人阶级和劳动人民向光荣的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会致以衷心的热烈祝贺，这次代表大会是在令人鼓舞的胜利的情况下举行的。（掌声）
    苏联在发展工农业、发展教育、科学和技术方面所取得的成就，使各国劳动人民普遍感到极大的兴奋。一切进步的人们都在为苏联的成就欢呼，并且认为苏联的成就是具有世界意义的胜利。苏联正迅速地向未来的日子前进，有力地显示出社会主义制度的优越性。
    苏联科学家、技术人员和工人发射了围绕着太阳的新行星，把人类的一个最大胆的幻想变成了现实，这就显示了科学技术方面的新功绩。他们同时也显示了为人类未来开辟光辉前景的社会主义的强大的创造威力。
    力量的对比情况发生了有利于世界社会主义体系的变化。苏联是一个强大的国家。人民中国也是强大的。兄弟般的亲密无间的其他社会主义国家也是强有力的。这些力量和这种团结一致是各国人民和平的保障。
  （掌声）
    第二十一次代表大会关于实现七年计划的决议，将使一个历史时刻提前到来。那时，走在社会主义各国前面的苏联，将在一切指标方面，包括增进群众物质福利方面，占世界第一位。这样，苏联将向全世界千百万人证明：社会主义是符合他们的利益的。（掌声）
    我们向坚定不移地忠于马克思列宁主义原则的伟大的列宁的党——苏联共产党表示我们的热烈祝贺和感谢。苏联共产党领导着苏联人民准备了并取得了预示着新胜利的异乎寻常的一些胜利，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的具有重大意义的报告就证明了这一点。（掌声）
    苏联和资本主义国家的状况的鲜明对比，现在越来越明显了。
    在苏维埃国家里，我们看到社会主义民主的蓬勃发展。在这里，劳动人民的生活水平正在不断提高，实行三十五—三十小时五天工作周的前景越来越清晰了。
    而在经济衰退必将导致致命后果的资本主义国家里，特别是在法国，劳动人民的受剥削和贫困化日益加剧。此外，还应当指出，整个城乡劳动居民的生存条件正在每况愈下，民主自由受到严重损害，法西斯威胁正在抬头。
    在这种困难的环境中，我们党仍然在继续进行斗争，把关心与人民利益不可分割的真正民族利益同坚定不移地忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则紧密联系起来。（掌声）
    大家知道，去年5月13日殖民主义的军政人员在阿尔及利亚发动政变后，作为这一法西斯性质的行动的结果，7月1日就在法国成立了政府。如果采取统一的行动，这种发展趋势是可以阻止的。但是，社会党领袖们的分裂政策瓦解了要求工人阶级实现战斗的统一的意图。结果戴高乐将军利用右翼社会党领袖们助长的沙文主义和殖民主义情绪，掌握了政权。
    我们党在自己整个历史中都不得不同沙文主义和种族主义思想根源——殖民主义进行残酷的斗争。我们党一向支持那些为摆脱殖民主义压迫而斗争的人民。在遭到迫害时，它从未退却过，在群众对它的政策有某些不理解时，它也不屈服，只要情况要求这样做，它就毫不犹豫地逆流而上。
    殖民体系的危机震撼着法兰西殖民帝国，随着殖民体系危机的到来，反殖民主义的斗争也复杂化了。正是因为这样，在反对阿尔及利亚战争的斗争中，我们尽一切努力来说服法国工人阶级和人民，使他们认清殖民战争的非正义性，但是我们遇到的困难要比在反对越南战争的斗争中大得多。
    在1956年1月2日大选后，许多法国人都相信，阿尔及利亚战争将要结束。但是，领导政府的社会党领袖们，走上了继续打下去的道路，并且使用最坏的沙文主义和殖民主义的论据在工人阶级的某一部分人当中进行宣传，并且发动了苏伊士冒险事件。
    我们党付出了巨大的努力来帮助社会党中的劳动群众，使他们向自己的领袖们施加压力，以便能用谈判的方式奠定阿尔及利亚的和平。尽管我们坚持不懈地努力，并屡次提出建议，但始终没有争取到以谈判方式来缔造和平。
    正当人们厌战情绪日益强烈，而必须举行谈判的思想给自己开辟道路的时候，阿尔及利亚的极端殖民主义者加速了事件的进程。他们在5月13日实行政变，并装模作样地同当地居民联欢。他们造谣说这种联欢标志着阿尔及利亚战争的结束。但是，阿尔及利亚的战争还在继续着。
    这就是资本主义垄断集团的头子们所奉行的政策的结果。当然，这些人，特别是石油垄断组织的领导人，首先感兴趣的是开发撒哈拉的富源，因而很想结束这场战争。但是，尽管他们的观点和极端殖民主义者的观点有些不同，直到现在局势都没有发生根本的变化。不久以前实行的大赦，也许是垄断资本集团希望找到打开目前局面的一种表现。但是，归根到底，重要之点在于政府继续反对举行谈判。实际上，正式拒绝同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线就阿尔及利亚政治地位问题举行任何谈判的作法，除了继续进行阿尔及利亚战争外，不会有别的结果。而阿尔及利亚战争正日益变成越来越大的流血战争。
    为了推行自己的政策，殖民主义和法西斯集团把阿尔及利亚和法国合并的思想同法兰西尊严的概念纠缠在一起。
    为了回答这些诡辩，我们党阐明，阿尔及利亚战争是违反民族的真正利益的。实际上这个战争不仅有损法国的国际威望，而且还破坏它的经济。尤其是，阿尔及利亚战争迫使法国政府更加依附美国和向波恩德国借债，而波恩德国则要求法国支持它的外交政策。
    事实表明，殖民主义对资本主义垄断集团有利，可是另一面它却导致战争、贫困、反动和使法国丧失民族独立。
    的确，阿尔及利亚战争所引起的经济和财政后果，在法国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府达成协议方面，以及在实行关于共同市场的协议方面都起了很大的作用。这项协议无疑是反映了这样的企图：在欧洲心脏建立一个受大资本主义垄断集团指挥的、由反动和黑暗势力所支持的国家集团，这个集团的任务之一，就是努力剥夺劳动人民的社会成果，破坏西欧资本主义国家的民主制度。
    此外，正当西德军国主义分子在北大西洋公约组织的影响扩大了的时候建立这个联盟就会阻碍柏林问题和德国问题的解决，关于这两个问题，苏联已经提出了可以借以获得符合各国人民的利益和保卫和平要求的解决办法的建议。
    法国已经开始奉行的对阿登纳政府的政策，基础是同那些违背巴黎协定、要求用原子武器武装西德军队的西德军国主义分子进行合作。法国统治集团不但不像我们祖国利益所要求的那样主张禁止核武器试验和裁军
  （包括裁减原子武装），反而支持波恩总参谋部，并且自己也准备生产原子弹。
    这样，法国统治者忘掉了历史的教训，开始重弹曾经帮助过希特勒分子的反苏滥调，实际上正投合了复活中的西德军国主义的心意。
    阿登纳拥有可以用来对法国政府施加压力的庞大资金，这个情况对欧洲和全世界的危险更大。因此，我们十分注意这方面的事件的发展。
    军费，特别是用于阿尔及利亚战争的费用，是法国工人阶级的沉重负担。而且，经济衰退愈益使得工作周缩短，解雇人数增加。在这种情况下，政府采取的旨在增加劳动群众赋税的措施显得十分突出，并且引起了完全可以理解的不安。
    大资本的进攻首先是打击工人阶级，它同时也指向其他各阶层劳动人民。进攻也指向中小农户。而且有人公开承认，这次进攻的任务之一是要消灭将近八十万个这样的农户。这次进攻也指向手工业者和商人、中小企业主，这些人面临着双重威胁：劳动群众购买力的降低和法国加入共同市场后所出现的竞争。
    1957年11月在莫斯科通过的、后来得到其他各国共产党和工人党赞同的十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表的共同宣言指出，垄断资产阶级和人民的各个阶层之间的矛盾正在加剧。纠合在戴高乐主义旗帜下的殖民主义者和法西斯分子利用内战来讹诈和恫吓，在法国建立了这样一种统治制度：在这种制度下面议会制度仅仅是个幌子，而国民议会成了对人民代表制的讽刺。这是一种失去任何民主内容并且包藏着法西斯威胁的制度。
    法国资产阶级统治集团一向喜欢高谈“自由”和“民主”，现在却抛弃了议会管理方法，因为这种方法妨碍他们执行战争、贫困和反动的政策。不应该把这看成是强大的标志，而应该看成是由殖民主义体系深重危机所引起的严重困难的结果。
    当工人阶级认为在一定的条件下有可能和平地，包括通过议会的途径，过渡到社会主义的时候，垄断资本的领导人却取消了资产阶级民主管理方法，更加露骨地和横暴地独揽国家事务的领导大权。
    不能离开欧洲的局势孤立地看待法国局势。因此，有关国家的劳动人民和民主人士团结一致地对待他们所面临的危险，这是可以理解的。
    至于谈到我们的党，它清楚地认识到自己对法国人民所负的责任，它首先努力指导工人阶级和那些受战争、贫困和反动政策危害的各阶层居民进行斗争，来反对鼓吹这种政策的垄断集团。这是主要的任务。假如不以必要的坚忍不拔的精神去实现这一任务，有人就可能通过法西斯的煽动宣传来蒙骗那些成为资本主义垄断组织所操纵的政府政策牺牲品的人。
    为了完成这一任务，我们党需要进行紧张的工作，我们党在最近一个时期内已经对反动派和法西斯的仆从所采取的反民主措施进行了坚决而彻底的反抗。当然，恶意的民族宣传和社会宣传所煽起的、并为要求个人权势的组织和个人所传播的幻想尚未消失。但是情况已经有了初步的改变。
    假如居伊·摩勒和社会党其他首领退出政府，并且决定在形式上、而不是实际上变成反对党，那就会迫使参加社会党的劳动者采取另一种行动。
    显然，根据这种原因，社会党的领袖们企图把他们党内出现的反对派纳入一定的轨道。他们将继续阻碍工人——社会党人和共产党人，以至全体劳动者实现必要的统一行动。
    这样的情况要求我们以极大的不屈不挠的精神来保证工人阶级的统一行动，使工人阶级的行动与国内其他阶层的行动结合起来，以便共同为反对资本主义垄断组织而斗争。必须孤立资本主义垄断组织，并迫使它们退却。
    这就是制止阿尔及利亚战争、提高人民生活水平、取得和平政策的胜利以及大量缩减军费开支的道路。
    当然，我们党现在碰到很大的困难，但是它将本着对马克思列宁主义原则无限忠诚的精神来光荣地完成摆在自己面前的任务。（掌声）
    在过去的一年里，我们党在实现它的第十四次代表大会的决议中为堵塞反动派和法西斯分子的道路进行了顽强的斗争。我们党执行的统一工人阶级行动和团结民主力量的正确政策，得到党内积极分子和党组织的拥护。劳动人民和民主人士，其中包括许多曾经受到敌人宣传蒙蔽的人，都愈来愈清楚地了解党的这一政策了。
    由此可见，我们党现在负着重大的责任。为了顺利地完成党所面临的任务，党必须是统一的，而这就要同可能损害党的队伍团结的一切现象进行无情的斗争。
    就是根据这种精神，我们和其他的马克思列宁主义兄弟党一样，为反对具有国际性的修正主义阴谋及机会主义和投降主义倾向而进行斗争。这些倾向总是在最艰苦、因而对未来的工人运动有决定意义的斗争时期找到适合的土壤。
    我们认为必须同修正主义作强有力的斗争，同时，我们也没有忽视克服因我们的斗争特点而产生的狭隘的宗派主义倾向。如果不顽强地同这种倾向作斗争，则它就要严重地妨碍我们为实现工人阶级和民主力量的行动统一而作的努力。
    我们党是坚固的！它经受住了暴风雨的考验，在最近的选举中，它获得了将近四百万法国男女公民的选票。（掌声）
    现在法国人民已经开始认清了局势，明天他们还会更清楚地理解到，统治集团利用他们的信任为非作歹，他们已经做了统治集团的牺牲品。
    任何东西也不能使我们忘记，在解释已发生的事件的真正意义和预见今天将发生的事件这方面是要归功于法国共产党的。法国共产党同时也有足够的勇气把真理告诉人民，号召人民团结起来进行斗争。
    至于说到未来，那我们完全相信法国人民，相信我国的前途。我们不断地加强统一行动的工作，这样我们就能动员法国人民群众开始新的斗争，以便通过同争取独立的阿尔及利亚人举行谈判的方法来结束阿尔及利亚的战争，实现主张民族独立、和平、民主革新和社会进步的政策。
    同志们！由于参加你们这次显示共产主义牢不可破的威力的卓越的代表大会，我们更加深信，工人阶级和人民力量将战胜反动派和法西斯，深信我们的事业必将胜利！
    代表同志们！在祝贺你们的时候，我们想告诉你们，我们以自己是共产主义者、是伟大事业的战士而感到自豪。世界各国人民怀着深刻的信仰为这个事业而斗争。共产主义——这个现代的人道主义——是全人类的希望和未来。（掌声）
    共产主义建设者的第二十一次代表大会万岁！（掌声）
    受全世界共产主义运动和工人运动感戴和信任的光荣的苏联共产党万岁！（掌声）
    共产党和工人党的马克思列宁主义的团结万岁！（掌声）
    不可战胜的马克思和列宁的学说万岁！（掌声）
    共产主义万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立）
