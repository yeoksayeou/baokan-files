Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th dispatch from TASS: Recently, under the initiative of various industrial trade unions in the German Democratic Republic, eleven all-German meetings of trade union members were held in Berlin, Erfurt, Suhl, Magdeburg, Schwerin, and other cities. Simultaneously, an all-German meeting of citizens was also held in Suhl. Participants in the meetings endorsed the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and condemned West Germany's militarist policies.

Participating in the Berlin meeting were thirty-five trade union activists from West Germany. Participants in the meeting advocated that workers and trade union organizations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic should hold talks on the peace treaty issue. They pointed out that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany contains many points in line with the resolutions and statements of West German trade unions.

West German trade union members from Schleswig-Holstein and members of the Free German Trade Union Federation from the Neubrandenburg district held a meeting in Nostritz. They issued a joint statement saying that the struggle against the threat of atomic death and German militarism should become the primary task of the German working class. The statement emphasized that the Soviet draft peace treaty opened the way to realizing the aspirations of all peace-loving Germans.

In Erfurt, West German trade union members from the Ruhr area, Hamburg, and Hesse met with representatives of the Free German Trade Union Federation's Executive Committee. The Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany was also discussed during the meeting. Participants in the meeting welcomed the struggle of Dortmund residents against atomic armament and emphasized that this struggle pointed the way for all West German workers to build a peaceful and democratic Germany.

On the 7th, two hundred and fifty West German citizens participated in the all-German meeting held in Suhl. Participants in the meeting welcomed the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, considering it the best means of restoring German national unity.

West German political commentator Gerst said that the Adenauer government's hopeless policies cannot stop the growing movement for national unification in West Germany.

West German actor Schmenglerel said that considering the disasters and misfortunes that German fascists and militarists brought to the Soviet people, the Soviet draft peace treaty is extremely magnanimous.
