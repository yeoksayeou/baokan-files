Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. Shanghai's secondary schools, in accordance with the spirit of full-time students focusing on study, have adjusted the relationship between the schools and the associated production units, and properly arranged the time for teaching and production labor.

Many schools and factories have conducted good consultations when arranging student labor. For example, when North Hongkou Middle School and a factory were arranging student labor time, some workers worried that too many student rotations would affect production and tutoring work. The factory's Party committee, on the one hand, strengthened education for the workers, and on the other hand, studied ways to improve the organization of students' participation in production labor, such as adopting a handover card system to minimize the impact on production when students change shifts. Some schools have also signed a "four-fix" system with factories, namely "fixed time, fixed type of work, fixed machine tool, and fixed master." The schools in Luwan District have included students' participation in production labor in the teaching plan, and the factories have also incorporated students' participation in production labor into the production plan. Generally, schools have already achieved high school students participating in labor twice a week, four hours each time; and junior high school students participating in labor twice a week, three hours each time. When arranging production labor, schools try as much as possible to pay attention to close integration with teaching content. Schools in Luwan District generally associate with three or more types of factories, such as heavy industry, light industry, and the textile industry.

Many schools arrange labor according to students' age and physical condition. For example, students at the First Girls' Middle School mainly participate in labor at pharmaceutical and textile factories, which combines teaching and takes into account the characteristics of female students.

Schools also pay attention to collaborating with associated factories to conduct political and ideological education for students. Some students, when working in factories, make a daily labor summary to summarize their ideological gains.

    根据学生以学习为主的精神安排参加劳动的时间
    上海各中学和挂钩工厂大协作
    新华社上海27日电　上海市中等学校根据全日制学校学生以学习为主的精神，调整了学校与挂钩生产单位的关系，妥善地安排了教学和生产劳动的时间。
    许多学校和工厂在安排学生劳动中，都进行了很好的协商。如北虹中学和工厂安排学生劳动时间时，有的工人担心参加劳动的学生调动太多会影响生产和辅导工作。工厂党委一面加强对工人的教育，一面研究改进组织学生参加生产劳动的办法，如采用交接卡制，尽量做到学生交接班时不影响生产等。有的学校还和工厂订了“定时间、定工种、定车床、定师傅”的四定制度。卢湾区各学校把学生参加生产劳动列入教学计划，工厂也把学生参加生产劳动纳入生产计划。一般学校都已经做到高中学生每周参加劳动两次，每次四小时；初中学生每周劳动两次，每次三小时。各校在安排生产劳动时，都尽可能注意到和教学内容密切结合。卢湾区各学校一般都和重工业、轻工业、纺织工业等三类以上的工厂挂上钩。
    许多学校都根据学生的年龄、体质来安排劳动，如第一女子中学学生主要是参加制药厂和纺织厂劳动，既结合了教学也照顾到女生的特点。
    各校还注意和挂钩工厂协作，对学生进行政治思想教育。有的学生到工厂劳动时，每天都作出劳动小结，总结自己思想上的收获。
