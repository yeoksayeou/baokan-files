Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant No. 2 Workshop, based on the different political, cultural, and technical levels of new workers, veteran workers, and technical personnel, runs spare-time schools with various academic systems and courses in the workshop. It teaches workers with uneven levels separately and sends workers with higher cultural levels to factory-run schools for study, so that all workers in the workshop can enroll according to their needs.

Currently, in addition to the political class in which all employees participate, the spare-time school in this workshop has several types of classes for cultural and technical courses, such as veteran worker special classes, applied learning classes, and regular learning classes. The study period also varies. The veteran worker special class recruits workers with good political standing, good production, and long service. Based on their rich practical experience and the fact that most of them have a junior high school education, a training plan focusing on improving their cultural level and basic technical knowledge has been developed. The aim is to train these veteran workers in a short period of time to be able to serve as intermediate designers and technical course teachers in the workshop's spare-time school. The regular learning class admits workers with a cultural level below junior high school. Their learning content emphasizes both culture and technology. The cultural courses include mechanical mathematics, mechanical physics, and Chinese language. Workers with a cultural level above junior high school are admitted to the applied learning class.

Because these measures have been adopted, the enthusiasm of workers in this workshop for participating in learning has generally increased. The attendance rate of students in the spare-time school's political class is 100%, and the attendance rate of cultural and technical classes has also increased by 40% compared to when they were in the factory-run school.

    上海机床厂第二车间业余学校 
    按工人政治文化技术分别教学
    新华社上海16日电　上海机床厂第二车间根据新工人、老工人、技术人员的政治、文化、技术水平不同的情况在车间举办有多种学制、课程的业余学校，对程度不齐的职工，分别教学，把文化程度较高的职工送到厂办学校学习，使全车间职工都能按需要入学。
    现在，这个车间的业余学校除政治课全体职工都参加学习外，文化课和技术课都设有老工人特别班、应用学习班和普通学习班等好几种班次，学习年限也各不相同。老工人特别班吸收了政治好、生产好和工龄较长的工人参加学习，并根据他们实际操作经验丰富、大都具有初中文化水平的条件，制订了一个着重提高文化程度和基础技术知识的培养计划，准备在短期内把他们这些老工人培养到能够担任中级设计员和车间业余学校技术课教师的水平。普通学习班吸收了文化程度在初中一以下的工人，他们的学习内容是文化与技术并重，文化课包括有机械数学、机械物理和语文三种。对文化程度在初中二以上的工人则吸收到应用学习班去。
    因为采取了这些措施，现在这个车间职工参加学习积极性普遍提高。业余学校政治课的学生出席率为百分之百，文化技术课的出席率，也比以前在厂办学校时增加了40％。
