Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th February: According to today's "Neues Deutschland," the Minister of Defense of the German Democratic Republic, General Staff Chief Stoph, spoke on February 4th at a lecture for young soldiers of the National People's Army in Cottbus. He said: "If it is discovered that some people are insane and dare to launch a military attack on the German Democratic Republic, they will be destroyed at the outset by the joint forces of the entire socialist camp. The National People's Army is always prepared to fulfill its duty to defend peace together with the fraternal armies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

Stoph continued: "We warn all those involved in new provocations that playing with fire will burn their own fingers. Our worker-peasant state will not be intimidated by such threats."

Speaking on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue, Stoph said that the Soviet Union's proposals in this regard have received great attention worldwide. He said that we are in favor of a swift conclusion of a peace treaty because we advocate ending the Cold War and preventing a hot war. We believe that the peace-loving forces in West Germany will gain increasing influence, thereby forcing the West German government to change its policies. The proposal put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic to peacefully reunify Germany through the formation of a confederation of the two Germanys has been endorsed by the broad masses of people in West Germany. Every West German citizen should also understand that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is in their interest because it is the only possible way to prevent a new war.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to a report by the German Press Agency, residents of Hamburg, West Germany, held a mass rally on the 5th to express their opposition to West German nuclear armament and to demand negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany and all-German negotiations.

Representatives of some West German political parties as well as people from all walks of life with different political views participated in the meeting. Participants in the meeting adopted a statement. The statement said that the Adenauer government should immediately abandon nuclear armament, discuss foreign policy issues in the Bundestag, and formulate a counter-proposal to respond to the Soviet Union's initiatives on the German issue. The statement emphasized that the West German government should, in principle, agree to hold negotiations on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe that does not participate in military blocs. The statement also called for all-German negotiations to begin as soon as possible, and for negotiations to be held with the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary in order to normalize the political relations between West Germany and these countries; and to abandon the "Cold War" in propaganda.

    民主德国国防部长警告战争狂人不要玩火
    两个德国应结成邦联实现和平统一
    新华社柏林7日电　据今天的“新德意志报”报道，德意志民主共和国国防部长斯多夫上将于2月4日在科特布斯举行的国家人民军青年军人的讲座上讲话。他说：“如果发现某些人丧心病狂，竟敢对德意志民主共和国发动军事进攻，他们在一开始即将为整个社会主义阵营的联合部队所摧毁。国家人民军一直准备同苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟军队一起执行它的保卫和平的职责”。
    斯多夫接着说：“我们警告同新的挑衅有关的一切人们，他们玩火必将烧毁自己的手指。我们的工农国家是不会为这种威胁所吓倒的。”
    斯多夫在谈到缔结对德和约问题和柏林问题时说，苏联在这方面的建议已受到全世界的极大注意。他说，我们赞成迅速缔结和约，因为我们主张结束冷战和防止热战。我们相信，西德爱好和平的力量将获得愈来愈大的影响，从而迫使西德政府改变政策。德意志民主共和国政府提出的通过两个德国结成邦联以及和平地重新统一德国的建议已经得到西德广大人士的赞同。每个西德公民还应当了解，缔结对德和约是符合他们的利益的，因为这是能够防止新战争的唯一可能的办法。
    新华社7日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，西德汉堡居民5日举行群众大会，表示反对西德原子武装，要求进行关于缔结对德和约的谈判和全德谈判。
    参加这个大会的有西德一些政党的代表以及不同政治观点的各行各业的人。参加大会的人通过一项声明。声明说，阿登纳政府应该立即放弃原子武装，在联邦议院中讨论外交政策问题，并且拟定一项反建议答复苏联在德国问题上的倡议。声明强调说，西德政府应该在原则上同意举行有关对德和约问题的谈判以及在欧洲建立不参加军事集团的无原子武器地区。这个声明还要求尽快地开始举行全德谈判，着手同波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利政府举行谈判，以使西德和这些国家的政治关系正常化；在宣传上摒弃“冷战”。
