    A Few Words to the Broad Masses of Cadres
    This column introduces some cadres who have gone deep among the masses. From these introductions, it can be seen that after a series of measures such as the rectification movement, the downplaying of cadres, and the participation of cadres in labor, our cadre style has greatly improved. The people of Zixi County said that the cadres are "good sons and daughters of the Communist Party and good servants of the people." This is the greatest praise the masses can give to the cadres.

    This praise is by no means just polite "small talk," but is supported by full practical proof. Last year's Great Leap Forward saw industrial and agricultural production increase many times over. This was due to the correct leadership of the Party, the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, and the active work of the broad masses of cadres. After seeing the results of the Great Leap Forward, the masses will naturally give the cadres the evaluation they deserve based on their work.

    Now, a new year has begun, and we should strive for an even greater leap forward on the basis of last year's leap forward. This puts a new task before all cadres: to maintain closer ties with the masses and continue to leap forward together with the broad masses. For many years, the Party has been teaching us to maintain close ties with the masses. The facts of last year's Great Leap Forward tell us that whoever can lead the masses to achieve great achievements in production is the most popular cadre among the masses. After the people's communes were established, many unfamiliar problems arose. Therefore, our cadres must, on the one hand, muster their energy and set an example for the masses, leading the broad masses to advance; on the other hand, they must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and carefully solve the problems that arise in their work. There is an old saying, "If three people are of one mind, their strength can break metal." If our cadres and the broad masses unite as one, this team of tens of millions of people will have "strength" that does more than "break metal." We will surely achieve a greater leap forward, and we will surely achieve a greater victory.

### 向广大干部说几句话

    向广大干部说几句话
    这一栏里，介绍了一些干部深入群众的情况。从这些介绍中可以看出：经过整风运动、干部下放和干部参加劳动等一系列措施后，我们的干部作风有了很大的改进。资溪县的群众说干部们是“共产党的好儿女，人民的好勤务员”，这是群众对干部的最大的赞誉。
    这种赞誉，决不是一般的“客气话”，而是具有充分实践的证明。去年的大跃进，工农业生产成倍地增长，这里面有党的正确领导，有群众的冲天干劲，同时也有广大干部的积极工作。群众在看到跃进成果之后，自然会根据干部的工作，给他们以应有的评价。
    现在，新的一年开始了，我们应当在去年跃进的基础上争取更大的跃进。这里，就对所有干部提出了一个新的任务：要更密切地联系群众，和广大群众一起继续向前跃进。多少年来，党一直教导我们要密切联系群众。去年大跃进的事实告诉我们，谁能带动群众在生产上取得巨大的成就，谁就是最受群众欢迎的干部。人民公社化后，又产生许多我们不熟悉的问题。因此，我们的干部一方面要鼓足干劲，做群众的表率，带动广大群众前进；一方面要虚心听取群众意见，细致地解决工作中产生的问题。过去有一句话，叫做“三人同心，其利断金”。我们的干部和广大群众团结起来，这一支千千万万人组成的队伍，“其利”又何止“断金”。我们一定可以实现更大的跃进，我们一定能够取得更大的胜利。
