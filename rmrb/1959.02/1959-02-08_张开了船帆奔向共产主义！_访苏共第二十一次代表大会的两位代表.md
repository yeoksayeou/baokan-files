    Sails Unfurled, Heading Towards Communism!
    ——Visiting Two Delegates to the 21st Congress of the CPSU
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang
    If anyone wants to understand the current mood of the Soviet people, I can say with certainty that the Soviet people's confidence in the struggle for communism is higher than ever. The light of communist construction not only shines in every corner of the Soviet Union, but also gleams in the hearts of every Soviet person. The ten-day 21st Congress of the CPSU has ended. The documents of the congress not only wrote down the Soviet people's aspirations for building communism, but also stipulated the grand tasks for realizing this ideal. The delegates' speeches each day, from different angles, presented the blueprint of the Seven-Year Plan for communist construction and the prospects for the future. These speeches, gathered together, form a symphony of communism that resounds through the sky, not only inspiring all the Soviet people, but also issuing them a solemn call to battle. Delegates from all over the Soviet Union, with immense confidence, are preparing to return and convey the resolutions passed by this congress.
    On the evening of the day the meeting had just closed, we visited two delegates to the 21st Congress of the CPSU at the "Ukraine" Hotel in Moscow. After the elevator took us up to the eighth floor, we saw many delegates exchanging their experiences with each other. Some were meeting for the first time, others had known each other for a long time. The few days of the meeting had tied them closely together. The plan for communist construction gave them enormous encouragement, and their faces were filled with a victorious joy. Some delegates were already packing their bags, preparing to return to their posts. In a room on the right wing of the eighth floor, we found Comrade Mokilevtsev, the delegate we needed to interview. When he saw us, he shook hands with us warmly, as if he were seeing old friends. He said that he had worked at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works for a period last summer, so seeing Chinese comrades was like seeing his fellow villagers. Comrade Mokilevtsev is a well-known steelworker in the Soviet Union. He has worked in the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works for more than thirty years. In such a long period, he doesn't know how many furnaces of steel he has smelted, nor how many apprentices he has trained. When we asked him about his impression of attending this congress, he said, "This is the first time in my life that I have attended a Party congress. On the day the meeting opened, the 27th, when I walked into the venue, my excited mood was truly indescribable. As a worker, I don't know how many construction projects I have participated in. After coming to the congress, I seemed to see a summary of our previous work, and also saw a new blueprint for future construction. When Khrushchev reported, one fact left a deep impression on me: the report said that the investment in the Seven-Year Plan will be equal to the total investment of all the Soviet era. Such a scale of construction has never been seen before. Taking the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works as an example, the situation is the same. I participated in the construction of this factory in 1927, which was precisely the period of the first Five-Year Plan. I was a member of the Communist Youth League at that time, and I came to Kuznetsk in response to the Party's call. For thirty years, I have personally witnessed how this factory has grown. Thirty years ago, this factory was just an ordinary steel plant, but today it has become an iron and steel complex with a world reputation. However, within the Seven-Year Plan, we will build another iron and steel complex of the same size, which is the West Siberian Iron and Steel Works stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. Our delegates from Kuznetsk were very moved, because when Khrushchev reported, he first talked about the development of our factory."
    Speaking of this, Comrade Mokilevtsev took out a large package of documents from the cupboard. Here, we saw a group photo of the Kuznetsk delegation and Khrushchev during the meeting break, as well as newspapers and magazines publishing Mokilevtsev's articles. This old steelworker picked up a copy of the conference documents and said to us that the speeches of all the delegates at this meeting had left a deep impression on him. He wanted to keep all the documents so that he could study them carefully after returning and report to the Communist Party members and workers in the factory. He said that he would not only convey the resolutions of the congress to everyone, but also bring back the determination and high morale to struggle for the cause of communism that he felt at the congress. Speaking of this, Mokilevtsev made a metaphor, "Through this congress, I have such a feeling that I feel that communist society is already waving to us. The Seven-Year Plan has raised the sails for our boat to communism, and the labor enthusiasm of the people of the whole country is like a gentle spring breeze. The route to communism has been opened up, and the day of reaching the goal is not far away."
    As we were talking, the door opened and two guests walked in. Mokilevtsev introduced us, saying that they were also delegates to the 21st Party Congress. One was Buzanin, a famous coal miner from Kuznetsk, and the other was Inozemtonev, the chairman of the "Karl Marx" collective farm in Kemerovo Oblast. Buzanin also told us about his feelings about attending this congress of communist builders. He said that this congress gave him great encouragement. He originally planned to speak at the congress, and he wanted to express to the congress his determination, and that of the Kuznetsk coal miners, to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Buzanin told us, "At the congress, I met Mamai, a famous Donbass miner from all over the Soviet Union. We exchanged work experience and decided to compete with each other to see who would complete the Seven-Year Plan first. The Mamai team is a communist labor team famous throughout the Soviet Union. In January of this year, they exceeded their quota by three and a half tons of coal per person per day. This is a very high indicator, because it takes a lot of effort to ensure that more than three tons of coal are extracted every day, but I believe that under the encouragement of this congress, our team will definitely find a way to not only compete with the Mamai team, but also hope to surpass them."
    We also asked Buzanin about the situation of the work team. He said, "Our work team has a total of ten people. The highest record is 12,000 tons of coal per day and night. Since the labor competition to welcome the 21st Party Congress was launched, everyone has been using their brains to study technology. I think after I return to my post, I must convey the determination of all the delegates and the entire Party at the congress to everyone, and work with everyone to formulate specific plans to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule."
    From the conversations of these two delegates, we once again felt the high enthusiasm of the Soviet people in building communism at present. Comrades Mokilevtsev and Buzanin both expressed to us that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was a congress of great historical significance. The Seven-Year Plan it passed will push the Soviet national economy to a new peak. Just as Comrade Mokilevtsev said, the sails of the Soviet Union's ship to communist society have been raised, and the enthusiasm of the Soviet people for construction is rising. The wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has pointed out the correct direction. The day of the completion of communism is not far away. The Soviet people have now entered a new stage of historical development. Let us wish the Soviet people a great victory in realizing the Seven-Year Plan.

    张开了船帆奔向共产主义！
    ——访苏共第二十一次代表大会的两位代表
    本报记者  崔永昌
    如果谁要了解一下目前苏联人民的心情是怎样的，那么我可以确切地回答你说，现在苏联人民为共产主义奋斗的信心空前高涨，共产主义建设的光芒不但照耀着苏联的每个角落，并且也闪烁在每个苏联人的心头。历时十天的苏共第二十一次代表大会结束了，大会的文件不但写下了苏联人民建设共产主义的心愿，并且也规定了实现这一理想的宏伟任务。代表们每天的发言从不同的角度展示了共产主义建设七年计划的蓝图和未来的前景。这些发言汇集在一起组成一部响彻云霄的共产主义交响乐，它不但鼓舞了全体苏联人民，并且也向他们发出了庄严战斗的号召。来自全苏各地的代表，怀着无比的信心带着这次代表大会通过的决议正在准备回去传达。
    在会议刚刚闭幕的这一天晚上，我们在莫斯科“乌克兰”旅馆访问了出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的两位代表。当电梯把我们带上八层楼以后，我们看到许多代表正在彼此交谈心得，他们有的是初次见面，有的是早已相识，几天的会议把他们紧紧地系在了一起。共产主义建设的计划给了他们巨大的鼓舞，他们每个人的脸上都洋溢着一种胜利的愉快，还有些代表已经在整理行装准备回到工作岗位上去了。在八楼右翼的一间屋里我们找到了需要访问的代表莫基列夫采夫同志。他看到了我们，好像是看到了老朋友一样热烈地和我们握手。他说，他去年夏天曾经在鞍山钢铁厂工作过一个时期，因此看到中国同志就好像看到自己的同乡一样。莫基列夫采夫同志是全苏有名的钢铁工人，他在库兹巴斯钢铁厂平炉车间已经工作了三十多年了，在这样漫长的时期里他不知道炼了多少炉钢水，也不知道带过了多少徒弟。当我们问他参加这次代表大会的印象时，他说“参加党的代表大会这在我的生活中还是第一次，27日会议开幕的那一天当我走进会场的时候，我那激动的心情真是难以描述的。作为一个工人我不知道参加了多少项工程的建设，来到代表大会以后我好像看到了我们以前工作的一个总结，并且看到了今后建设的新蓝图。当赫鲁晓夫报告的时候有一个事实给了我深刻的印象：报告中说，七年计划中的投资将等于苏维埃年代所有投资的总和。这样的建设规模是从来没有过的，如果拿库兹巴斯钢铁厂来说情况也是一样，我是1927年参加这个工厂的建设的，那正是第一个五年计划的时期，我那时是一个共青团员，当时响应了党的号召来到库兹巴斯。三十年来，我亲眼看到了这个工厂是怎样成长起来的，三十年前这个工厂还是个普通钢铁厂，但是今天也成了一个有世界声誉的钢铁联合企业。但是七年计划内我们要再建设同样大的一个钢铁联合企业，这就是七年计划中规定的西西伯利亚钢铁厂。我们库兹巴斯的代表们都非常感动，因为在赫鲁晓夫报告的时候他首先谈到了我们厂的发展问题。”
    说到这里莫基列夫采夫同志从橱里拿出了一大包文件，这里我们看到了会议休息时库兹巴斯代表团和赫鲁晓夫的合影以及登载有莫基列夫采夫文章的报纸杂志。这位年老的炼钢工人，拿起一本会议文件向我们说，这次会议上所有代表的发言都给他留下了深刻的印象，他要把所有的文件保存好以便回去以后仔细研究向工厂的共产党员和工人们作传达报告。他说，他不但要把大会的决议传达给大家，并且要把大会上那种为共产主义事业奋斗的决心和昂扬的斗志带回去。谈到这里莫基列夫采夫打了个比喻说，“通过这次大会我有这样一个感觉，我感到共产主义社会已经在向我们招手了，七年计划给我们撑起了奔向共产主义的船的帆篷，全国人民的劳动热情好像是一股和煦的春风。通向共产主义的航路已经打通了，到达目的的日子已经不远了。”
    当我们谈到这里的时候房门打开了，有两位客人走了进来，莫基列夫采夫给我们介绍说，他们也是出席第二十一次党代表大会的代表，其中一位是库兹巴斯著名的煤矿工人布扎宁，另一位是克蔑洛沃州“卡尔·马克思”集体农庄主席伊诺泽姆托涅夫。布扎宁向我们也谈了他出席这次共产主义建设者代表大会的感想。他说，这次大会给了他很大的鼓舞，他本来准备在大会发言，他想向大会表示自己和库兹巴斯煤矿工人保证提前完成七年计划的决心。布扎宁向我们说“在大会上我和全苏出名的顿巴斯矿工马马伊见了面，我们交换了工作经验并且决定互相竞赛看谁先完成七年计划。马马伊工作队是全苏闻名的共产主义劳动队，他们在今年1月每人每天超额开采三吨半煤，这是一个很高的指标，因为每天保证超额开采三吨多煤是需要很大努力的，但是我相信在这次代表大会的鼓舞下，我们的工作队一定会想出办法不但要和马马伊工作队竞赛，并且希望超过他们。”
    我们又问了布扎宁工作队的情形，他说，“我们的工作队一共有十个人，最高的纪录是每昼夜出煤一万二千吨，自从展开了迎接第二十一次党代表大会的劳动竞赛以后，大家都在开动脑筋钻研技术，我想我回到工作岗位以后，一定要把大会上全体代表和全党的决心好好地转达给大家，并且同大家一起订出具体的计划，争取提前完成七年计划。”
    从这两位代表的谈话中，我们再一次地感到了苏联人民目前建设共产主义的高度热情。莫基列夫采夫和布扎宁同志都向我们表示，苏共第二十一次代表大会是一次有着重大历史意义的大会，它所通过的七年计划将会把苏联的国民经济推向一个新的高峰，正像莫基列夫采夫同志说的，现在苏联奔向共产主义社会的船的帆篷已经撑起，苏联人民建设的热情正日益高涨，苏联共产党英明的领导指出了正确的方向。共产主义建成的日子已经不远了，苏联人民现在进入了一个历史发展的新阶段，让我们预祝苏联人民在实现七年计划中取得巨大的胜利。
