A Minister and Also a Worker

Comrade Liang Shengyin, the Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Xinle County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province, has loved machines since he was a child. He knows a thing or two about almost any machine. When the Xinle Iron and Steel Plant was established, many machines were brought in, and the operators were mostly farmers and young students who had put down their hoes and books. The repair of the machines all depended on him, and once he got into the machine room, he wouldn't come out until he had fixed the problem, no matter how big or small. Therefore, he was always covered in grease and had a black face. People affectionately called him "Master Liang."

Comrade Liang Shengyin is truly worthy of being called "Master Liang." He eats, lives, and labors with the workers. He wears a willow-woven hat, glasses, and gloves all day long, staying by the blast furnace. He also frequently carries steel drills, swings sledgehammers, stokes the fire, and mixes the ingredients. Those who know him know that he is a minister; those who don't know him think he is an ordinary worker. Once, this happened: One morning, the water tank broke down, and many workers ran to repair it. Minister Liang instructed a new worker who was crushing ore to release the water gate. The worker said, "I am a worker, and you are also a worker. We should listen to the leadership, not give random commands." This made everyone laugh.

"Have you eaten?" This is what workers say when they meet Minister Liang. Because the workers all know that he is busy with work and often forgets to eat. Workers like Qiu Shuju often buy him food and bake a few flatbreads by the blast furnace, waiting for him to come and eat.

    是部长，也是工人
    中共河北省新乐县委工业交通部部长梁生印同志，从小就爱机器。对差不多的机器，他都懂点门。新乐炼铁厂一成立，调来很多机器，操作人员绝大部分是放下锄头、书本的农民和青年学生。机器的修理就全靠他了，而他一钻到机器房里就不出来，无论大小毛病，非一气修好不可。因此，他成天黑手黑脸，浑身是油。人们亲切的称他为“梁师傅”。
    梁生印同志也真称得起是“梁师傅”。他和工人同吃同住同劳动，成天戴着柳编帽、镜子、手套，守在高炉旁；抱钢钎、抡大锤、通火、配料，也是经常的事。熟悉他的，知道他是个部长；不熟悉的，就认为他是一个普通工人。曾经发生过这样一回事：一个早晨，水箱发生了故障，很多工人跑来抢修。梁部长指挥一个正在砸矿石的新工人去放水闸，这个工人说：“我是个工人，你也是个工人，要听领导的指挥，不要乱指挥”。这一下逗得大家都笑了。
    “你吃饭了没有？”这是工人们碰到梁部长时的见面话。因为工人们都知道他忙于工作，时常忘掉吃饭。工人仇书菊等经常给他买下饭，在高炉边烤上几个饼子，等他来了给他吃。
