Fuzhou, February 4th (reported by this newspaper) - In Jinjiang Special District, Fujian Province, many people's communes, while adopting concentrated forces for large-scale shock campaigns, are also promoting a fertilizer accumulation responsibility system that involves dividing into teams and plots (with fixed quality and quantity) for contracted accumulation, or assigning responsibility based on the main types of fertilizer accumulation work. This has greatly increased the enthusiasm of all teams and members of the commune for accumulating fertilizer, accelerated the speed of accumulation, and improved the quality.

Recently, after the launch of the fertilizer accumulation campaign in Jinjiang Special District, many people's communes, while adjusting the forces on various production fronts to organize large-scale shock fertilizer accumulation, also paid attention to applying the production responsibility system to the fertilizer accumulation campaign. When implementing the fertilizer responsibility system, the communes generally divided the fertilizer accumulation zones by brigade, based on this year's agricultural leap forward plan, the measures to increase production of different crops on each plot of land, and the need for fertilizer. They organized fertilizer accumulation teams separately, so that each production team and all members of the commune clearly understood their fertilizer accumulation tasks. As a result, the enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer increased rapidly, and fertilizer accumulation competitions were widely launched between zones and between teams. When the Gaofeng Brigade of the Longhua Commune in Xianyou County vigorously engaged in smoking soil for fertilizer accumulation, after each cultivated area implemented a responsibility system of three people contracting one plot based on quality and quantity, the daily area of smoked fields quickly accelerated from the original three to five mu to eight to fifteen mu. According to the main types of work for smoking soil fertilizer, the Guanqiao Commune in Anxi County divided them into various specialized labor organizations such as going up the mountain to cut thatch, transportation, and smoking the fields. They set up camps in the fields, implemented side-by-side cutting of grass, drying, transportation, and smoking of the fields, with division of labor and responsibility and mutual cooperation. The fertilizer accumulation army, consisting of more than 600 professional teams with more than 41,000 people, accumulated more than 1,130,000 dan of fertilizer, cut more than 1,700,000 dan of grass, and smoked more than 900 mu of fields in just a few days. They are now striving to reach 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu before the Spring Festival.

With the rapid promotion of the responsibility system, the fertilizer accumulation campaign in various communes in the Jinjiang area is moving towards a new climax. For more than half a month, hundreds of thousands of people in the area have been going up the mountains and down to the sea to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, exploring various new sources of fertilizer, and the daily amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached tens of millions of dan.

    划分战区　明确责任
    晋江专区积肥多质量好
    本报福州4日电　福建省晋江专区许多人民公社在采取集中兵力进行大兵团作战的突击运动同时，推行一种分队、分片（定质定量）包干积肥，或按积肥主要工种分工负责的积肥责任制度，大大提高了公社各队和全体社员积肥积极性，加快了积肥速度和提高了积肥质量。
    最近，晋江专区积肥运动开始后，许多人民公社一面调整各条生产战线兵力，组织大兵团作战的突击积肥，一面注意到把生产责任制度用到积肥运动中去。各公社在推行积肥责任制时，一般都是根据今年农业跃进计划，各片土地不同作物的增产措施，和对肥料的需要，以大队为单位划分积肥战区，分别组织积肥队伍，使各生产队和全体社员都清楚地知道自己积肥的任务：因而积肥积极性迅速提高，战区与战区、队与队之间普遍开展了积肥竞赛。仙游县龙华公社高峰大队大搞熏土积肥时，各耕作区推行按质按量，三人包干熏一片的责任制后，每天熏田面积很快就由原来三亩到五亩加快到八亩到十五亩。安溪县官桥公社根据熏田积肥的几个主要工种，分成上山割茅草、运输、熏田等多种专业劳动组织，在田间安营扎寨，实行边割草边晒边运输边熏田，分工分业负责和互相合作，单是由六百多个专业队四万一千多人组成的积肥大军，在几天里就积肥一百一十三万多担，割草一百七十多万担，熏田九百多亩，现正力争在春节前积肥量达到每亩一千担。
    随着责任制度的迅速推开，晋江地区各公社积肥运动正推向新的高潮。半个多月来，全区经常有几十万人上山下海大闹积肥，发掘各种各样新的肥源，每天积肥量都到上千万担。
