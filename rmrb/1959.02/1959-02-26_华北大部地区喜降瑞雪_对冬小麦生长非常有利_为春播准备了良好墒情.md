    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th—Since the morning of February 24th, most parts of North China have experienced welcome snowfall. As of 8:00 AM on February 25th, the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region received four to six millimeters of snow, with individual areas reaching eleven to thirteen millimeters; northern Shanxi received two to five millimeters of snow; north of Shijiazhuang in Hebei generally received four to eight millimeters, with the heaviest snowfall near Beijing. According to records from the Beijing Western Suburb Meteorological Observatory, a total of 28.4 millimeters of snow fell within twenty-four hours, creating the highest February snowfall record in Beijing's more than eighty years of meteorological records.
    This snowfall is very beneficial for winter wheat, and the areas with heavy snowfall are equivalent to having been irrigated once for the greening stage. Recently, the surface layer of the soil in the North China Plain has thawed, allowing the snow water to seep into the ground. This snowfall has also prepared good soil moisture for spring sowing.
    This snowfall was caused by the convergence of cold and warm air currents in northern Shanxi and Hebei, forming a low-pressure area in northern North China. In recent days, the Mongolian high-pressure area has extended southeastward, and a relatively strong southeasterly wind has appeared in southeastern Hebei, continuously transporting warm and humid air to the North China region. On February 24th, a cold air mass from the northwest entered Shanxi. Therefore, the situation of cold and warm air converging in northern Shanxi and Hebei was formed. Currently, this low-pressure area is moving eastward, and it is expected to move out of the mainland soon.

### 华北大部地区喜降瑞雪  对冬小麦生长非常有利　为春播准备了良好墒情

    华北大部地区喜降瑞雪
    对冬小麦生长非常有利　为春播准备了良好墒情
    新华社25日讯　从24日上午开始，华北大部地区普降瑞雪。截至25日上午八时，内蒙古自治区中部降雪四到六公厘，个别地区达十一到十三公厘；山西北部降雪二到五公厘；河北石家庄以北一般达四到八公厘，北京附近降雪最大，据北京西郊气象观测站纪录，在二十四小时内共降雪二十八·四公厘，创造了北京自有气象纪录后，八十多年来2月份降雪的最高纪录。
    这次降雪对冬小麦非常有利，降雪大的地区等于灌了一次返青水。最近华北平原土壤表层已经解冻，雪水可以渗入地中，这次降雪也为春播准备了良好的墒情。
    这次降雪是冷、暖空气在山西、河北北部汇合，华北北部形成低气压引起的。最近几天来，蒙古高气压向东南伸展，河北东南部出现了较强的东南风，使暖湿空气源源不断输送到华北地区。24日，西北有一股冷空气进入山西。所以形成冷、暖空气在山西、河北北部汇合的情形，目前，这个低气压正向东移动，预计不久将移出大陆。
