My Views on Using Traditional Artistic Techniques
Hong Xiannu

Performing modern plays allows one to come into contact with many new things and feel the pulse of the times. For me, modern plays are very attractive. Moreover, due to my lack of revolutionary struggle experience and practical knowledge, I inevitably encounter new difficulties when performing modern plays. To overcome these difficulties, I must study harder. Thus, performing modern plays is also a good opportunity to improve myself politically.

Of course, modern plays are still an experiment. Not only do they fail to meet the needs of audiences and theaters in terms of quality and quantity, but there are also some artistic techniques in the performances that need to be resolved. On the issue of repertoire, the Party has correctly proposed the "walking on two legs" policy, requiring a combination of modern and traditional plays. On the issue of artistic techniques, how should we understand this combination? I think it means that when performing modern plays, we should study how to correctly apply traditional artistic techniques.

The relationship between traditional artistic techniques (including acting, melodies, stage design, etc.) and modern dramas (modern life, modern characters) is contradictory yet consistent. Our goal is to make them consistent. But can traditional artistic techniques be applied to modern dramas? The answers are not the same for everyone. There are two basic opposing views: one believes that we must inherit the artistic techniques of the past and earnestly learn from traditional artistic techniques; the other believes that there is no need to learn from traditional things and there is a tendency to ignore traditional artistic techniques.

I haven't performed many modern plays, but in the process of performing, I have realized that traditional artistic techniques can still serve modern dramas. For example, in "Red Flower Ridge," there is a scene where a widow, Aunt You, who actively participates in revolutionary work, learns that Communist Party member Zhang Sheng has been martyred at Red Flower Ridge, and her superiors want her to take Zhang Sheng's orphaned child to a safe area. Taking advantage of the late night, she carries Zhang Sheng's child and steals to Red Flower Ridge, hoping to see Zhang Sheng's remains... When rehearsing, I considered: how to express the time and Aunt You's mood at that time? In the end, I decided to use a little of our traditional "walking the edge" body dance appropriately. This can both meet the needs of the plot and be easily accepted by the audience. Therefore, I think that as long as it is not a mechanical application, we can and should accept and develop the excellent traditions of our ancestors that have been tested and continuously modified by the masses. Another example is the music of the Cantonese opera "Red Glow." At first, we were a little unsure about adding traditional tunes to modern dramas, thinking that it would not express the characters and atmosphere in modern dramas, but after repeated research and rehearsals, the traditional tunes could still appropriately and harmoniously meet the requirements of the plot development. In this way, we once again gained experience, proving that traditional things can serve modern dramas. The problem lies in whether we apply them appropriately, that is, whether we pay attention to the character of the play and the emotions at the time in terms of musical arrangement and singing style.

Traditional artistic techniques are the result of the long-term efforts of our predecessors. Every movement, every stillness, every word, every smile, every posture, and every tune... have been researched and tested countless times. It can be said that they have been tempered thousands of times. Such things should be regarded as extremely rich and precious heritage to be inherited, and should not be despised, let alone easily discarded. In modern dramas that express modern life, many of them can be used. We cannot draw an insurmountable gap between traditional artistic techniques and the performance of modern dramas.

A very important reason for those who say that traditional techniques cannot be used to express modern dramas is that times are different and life is also different. Yes, art is a reflection of real life, and different times and lives should have different artistic expressions. Now we should have a new set of artistic expression techniques for performing new plays. But the so-called different life is not completely without any similarities. There are also similarities in these differences. For example, walking, an ancient woman and a modern woman, walk in slightly different postures. But they all walk on two legs instead of one leg, and they all walk forward instead of sideways or backward. There is no difference. The national living habits and styles also have their traditions. In this way, the traditional techniques of women walking, concentrated on the stage, can be selected or transformed and applied in modern dramas that express modern life.

The artistic techniques of modern dramas need to be boldly created, which is beyond doubt. However, creation cannot exclude traditional artistic techniques, but must start from tradition and carry out "bringing forth the new through the old" on the basis of tradition. If we completely deviate from tradition, there is a possibility of losing the characteristics of opera. For example, Cantonese opera, if we completely abandon the original tunes, practices, tunes, etc., it is difficult to say that it is Cantonese opera. For an actor, if he completely deviates from traditional techniques and changes to a new set of things in singing, dancing, and movements, he will definitely feel unfamiliar and difficult when performing, and it is impossible to perform the play both skillfully and cleverly. For the audience, once they discard what they like to see and hear, they will also feel unaccustomed and dissatisfied.

I understand that creation must start from tradition in two aspects: One aspect is to find artistic methods that reflect today's actual life from the methods of reflecting historical reality that have been tempered thousands of times in the past. We should all work together to create a new artistic technique from scratch, from infancy to maturity, from rough to delicate, and then enrich our traditional art treasury. On the other hand, we must try our best to explore, select, utilize and transform some traditional artistic techniques of the past to adapt them to the needs of expressing modern life and modern characters, and serve today's great socialist construction cause. For example, Cantonese opera music, there are about a thousand tunes that are easy to sing, easy to understand, and loved by the masses. Can't these be used for modern dramas? I think we should quickly organize, transform and utilize them.

The inheritance and utilization of traditional techniques, of course, cannot be copied. The traditional artistic techniques that have been tempered thousands of times have almost formed a certain formula. But these formulas are not applicable in all occasions. Especially when performing modern dramas, many techniques, postures, and tunes are not suitable. I think that traditional techniques that are not suitable should not be used indiscriminately, use as much as possible if they can be used, and improve and improve them before using them if they need to be improved. Formalistic hard copying is wrong in any case. This is not only the case when using traditional artistic techniques in modern dramas, but also when performing traditional plays. For example, in traditional dramas, there is "Praying to the Moon" in "The Story of a Secluded Chamber," "Praying to the Moon" in "The Tale of the Chain," and "Praying to the Moon" in "The West Chamber." Although "Praying to the Moon" is the same, the characters, plots, thoughts and feelings are completely different. So can we use a "Praying to the Moon" formula to force it on Rui Lan, Diao Chan, and Yingying? Of course not. I remember Mr. Mei Lanfang in "Drunken Concubine," even though he was Yang Guifei, he drank three cups of wine in a row, and each cup had a different posture and tone. I think this just illustrates this point.

We cannot regard learning and using traditional artistic techniques as being divorced from politics. Learning and using traditional artistic techniques is not opposed to "politics in command." According to my understanding, the so-called "politics in command" is: first, to solve the problem of who art serves; second, to solve the problem of our actors' worldview or standpoint. We cannot say that traditional artistic techniques cannot serve workers, peasants and soldiers (whether through performing traditional dramas or modern dramas), nor can we say that the use of traditional artistic techniques does not require a revolutionary worldview (performance techniques are meaningful only when combined with the characters' thoughts and feelings, and to have a correct understanding and grasp of the characters' thoughts and feelings, whether performing modern dramas or traditional dramas, requires actors to have a correct worldview to do it), so the problem of "politics in command" and the learning and utilization of traditional artistic techniques are not mutually exclusive, but rather mutually consistent. Therefore, we cannot lump together those who are committed to studying traditional techniques as being divorced from politics. Of course, the phenomenon of blindly pursuing so-called "techniques," only talking about "performing skills and singing skills" (and this refers narrowly to "postures, dances, tunes"), and not asking about politics does exist, and we must oppose it. But this cannot be confused with what I said about correctly learning and using traditional artistic techniques.

Performing modern dramas can and should use traditional artistic techniques. Advocating learning from traditional techniques does not in the slightest mean relaxing the exploration and creation of new artistic techniques. The application of traditional artistic techniques will not only not hinder the exploration and growth of new artistic techniques, but will also complement and promote each other. So, in general, I repeatedly mentioned the issue of learning from traditional techniques in order to seek the combination of modern dramas and traditional art, and to look forward rather than backward.

The times are leaping forward, and art should naturally also take steps forward. Under the correct guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy, and in various new attempts, I think our opera art will surely appear with a new look. May we grow together with new things.

[Editor's note] Regarding how to further improve the opera repertoire with modern themes and how to better inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of China's opera art, we published articles by comrades Mei Lanfang, Cao Yu, Zhang Geng, and Yi Bing on December 10th, December 23rd, and January 6th of last year, respectively, for discussion. Today, we published an article by Hong Xiannu, a famous Cantonese opera actress. Based on her personal experience, the author put forward noteworthy views on these issues. We hope that other actors and playwrights with rich artistic accomplishments will continue to express their opinions.

    我对运用传统艺术技巧的看法   
    红线女
    演现代戏使人接触到许多新鲜事物，使人感受到时代的脉搏。对我说来，现代戏是富于吸引力的。而且，由于自己的革命斗争经验和实际知识都缺少，在演现代戏中，不能不遇到一些新的困难，为了克服这些困难，就得加倍地学习。这样，演现代戏又是在政治上提高自己的好机会。
    当然，现代戏毕竟还是一种尝试，不但在质量和数量上都不能满足观众和剧场的需要，而且在表演的艺术技巧方面，也存在一些尚待解决的问题。在剧目问题上，党已正确地提出“两条腿走路”的方针，要求现代戏和传统戏两者相结合。在艺术技巧问题上，应该怎样去理解这种结合呢？我觉得，就是演现代戏应该研究如何正确地运用传统艺术技巧的问题。
    传统艺术技巧（包括演技、曲调、舞台设计等）和现代剧（现代生活、现代人物）的关系，是相矛盾而又相一致的。我们的目的是要求它们一致起来。但是传统艺术技巧，能否被运用到现代戏中来呢？回答并不是人人相同的。这里有两种基本相反的看法：一种认为必须继承过去的艺术技巧，认真向传统艺术技巧学习；一种认为无须乎学习传统的东西，对传统艺术技巧存在忽视的倾向。
    现代戏我演得不多，不过在演出过程中，我体会到传统艺术技巧还是可以为现代剧服务的。比如在“红花岗”中，有一场戏是这样的：当一个积极参加革命工作的寡妇尤大姐知道共产党员张胜已在红花岗就义，而上级又要她携带张胜的遗孤逃避到安全地区；趁着深夜她背着张胜的孩子偷到红花岗去，希望能一见张胜的遗骸，……排戏的时候我曾经考虑过：怎样去表现当时的时间和当时尤大姐的心情？最后，我还是决定把我们传统的“走边”的身段舞蹈，适当地运用了一点。这样既能达到剧情的需要，观众又容易接受过来。因此，我想只要不是生搬硬套，我们还是可以和应该把先人经过群众考验、不断修改的优良传统接受过来，并加以发展的。又如粤剧“红霞”的音乐。开始，我们对把传统的曲牌加进现代戏中，有些信心不足，以为它表达不出现代戏中的人物性格和气氛，但经过一再研究和排练，传统的曲牌腔调还是能够恰当地、和谐地达到剧情发展的要求的。这样，我们又一次地取得了经验，证明了传统的东西是能够为现代剧服务的。问题在于我们运用得是否恰当，即是否在配曲和唱腔方面注意到戏的人物性格和当时的情感。
    传统艺术技巧是经过前人长期努力得来的。它的一动一静、一言一笑、一姿一态，以及一腔一调……都经过无数次的研究、试验，真可以说是千锤百炼。这样的东西，应被视为极其丰富极其珍贵的遗产继承下来，而不应受到轻视，更不要轻易就把它抛弃。在表现现代生活的现代戏中，有不少是可以用得着的。我们不能在传统艺术技巧和现代剧的表演之间划上一道宽不可逾的鸿沟。
    说传统技巧不能用来表现现代剧的人，有一个很重要的理由，就是：时代不同，生活也不同了。不错，艺术是现实生活的反映，不同的时代和生活，应该有不同的艺术表现手法。现在我们演新戏就应有一套新的艺术表现技巧。但是所谓生活不同，不是完全一点相同的地方也没有的。在这不同里面也有相同的地方。例如走路，一个古代的女人跟一个现代的女人，走起路来在姿态上是有些不相同的。但是他们都是用两条腿走路而不是一条腿走路，她们都是向前面走而不是打横走或后退着走，这是没有区别的。民族的生活习惯、风格，也有其传统性。这样看来，在舞台上集中起来的关于女人走路的传统技巧，经过选择或改造，就可以在表现现代生活的现代剧中有所运用了。
    现代剧的艺术技巧需要进行大胆的创造，这是无需怀疑的。但是创造不但不能排斥传统的艺术技巧，而且必须从传统出发，在传统的基础上进行“推陈出新”。如果完全离开传统，就会有失去戏曲特性的可能。比如粤剧，完全不要原有的曲牌、做法、腔调等等，就很难说它是粤剧了。对于一个演员来说，完全离开传统的技巧，在念曲、舞蹈、动作等等上都换上一套新的东西，演起戏来一定会感到生疏烦难，决不可能把戏演得又工又巧。而对观众来说，因为一旦把他们所喜闻乐见的东西都抛除，也会使他们感到不习惯和不满意的。
    创造必须从传统出发，我是从两个方面来理解的：一个方面，是从过去如何反映历史现实的千锤百炼的方法中，去寻找反映今天实际生活的艺术方法。我们大家应群策群力，一样又一样地从无到有，从幼稚到成熟，从粗糙到细致，使我们能够创造出一种新的艺术技巧，并进而丰富我们的传统艺术宝库。另一方面，我们要尽可能地挖掘、选择、利用和改造过去的一些传统艺术技巧，使其适应表现现代生活和现代人物的需要，为今天伟大的社会主义建设事业服务。比如粤剧的音乐，易唱易懂而又为群众所喜闻乐见的曲调，约有一千种之多，难道这些对现代剧都用不上去吗？我以为我们应该赶快把它加以整理、改造和利用。
    传统技巧的继承和利用，当然不能照搬。经过千锤百炼的传统艺术技巧，差不多都已经形成了一定的程式。但是这些程式不是在所有的场合都能适用的。尤其是在演现代剧的时候，有不少的手法、身段、腔调都不适宜了。我认为，传统技巧不适合的不要乱用，能用的就尽量地用，须加改进提高的就改进提高后再用。形式主义地硬搬乱套，在任何情况下都是不对的。这不只是在演现代剧运用传统艺术技巧时如此，就是在演传统剧目时也是一样的。比如传统剧中，有“幽闺记”里的“拜月”，有“连环记”里的“拜月”，也有“西厢记”里的“拜月”，虽则“拜月”相同，但人物、情节，思想感情全不一样。那么能否用一个“拜月”的程式去往瑞兰、貂蝉、莺莺三人身上硬套呢？当然不能。记得梅兰芳先生在“醉酒”中，同是一个杨贵妃，连饮了三杯酒，每一杯的姿态，声调都不相同，我想这正好说明这个道理。
    不能把学习和运用传统艺术技巧，看成是脱离政治。学习和运用传统艺术技巧和“政治挂帅”不是对立的。所谓“政治挂帅”，据我的认识是：第一解决艺术为谁服务的问题；第二解决我们演员的世界观或立场问题。既不能说传统艺术技巧不能为工农兵服务（无论是通过演传统剧或现代剧），又不能说传统艺术技巧的运用不需要革命的世界观（表演技巧要和人物的思想感情结合起来才有意义，而要对人物的思想感情有正确的理解和掌握，无论演现代剧或传统剧，都要求演员有正确的世界观才能做到），所以“政治挂帅”问题与传统艺术技巧的学习利用并非互不相容，反之倒是互相一致的。因此不能笼统地把致力于钻研传统技巧的人视为脱离政治。当然，那种一味追求所谓“技巧”，只讲“做工和唱工”（而这又是狭隘地指“身段、舞蹈、腔调”），而不问政治的现象是存在的，我们必须反对。但这不能和我说的正确地学习和运用传统的艺术技巧混为一谈。
    演现代剧是能够和应该运用传统艺术技巧的。主张向传统技巧学习，丝毫不含有放松对新的艺术技巧的探求和创造之意。传统艺术技巧的运用，不但不会妨碍新的艺术技巧的探求和生长，而且是互相补充互相促进的。所以总的说来，我一再提到向传统技巧学习的问题，是为了求得现代剧和传统艺术这两者的结合，是为了向前看而不是为了向后看。
    时代正飞跃地向前发展，艺术自然也应当迈开脚步。在党的文艺方针的正确指导下，在各种新的尝试中，我想，我们的戏曲艺术一定会出现新的面貌。愿我们能与新事物一同成长。
   〔编者附记〕关于如何进一步提高现代题材的戏曲剧目，如何更好地继承和发扬我国戏曲艺术的优秀传统，去年12月10日、23日，今年1月6日，我们分别发表了梅兰芳、曹禺、张庚、伊兵等同志的文章，进行了探讨。今天，我们发表了粤剧著名演员红线女的文章，作者根据亲身的体会，对这些问题提出了值得注意的看法。我们希望其他有丰富艺术修养的演员、编剧家继续发表意见。
