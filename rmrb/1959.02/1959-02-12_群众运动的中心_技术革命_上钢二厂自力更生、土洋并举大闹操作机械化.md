    The Focus of Mass Movement—Technical Revolution
    Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant Relies on Self-Reliance, Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Vigorously Promote Operational Mechanization
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 11th Dispatch) A technical revolution movement centered on gradually realizing operational mechanization, aiming at increasing production without increasing manpower and doubling production, is vigorously unfolding in the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant.
    In mid-January, the plant's Party Committee discussed the issue of doubling this year's production and ensuring the completion of a greater leap forward task. At the meeting, some people believed that to realize this year's leap forward plan, it would be necessary to add 1,500 workers. However, others disagreed, arguing that it was necessary to continue to tap the potential of existing equipment and labor. To this end, the plant's Party Committee specially organized a working group to conduct a thorough investigation. After investigation and analysis, it was found that the output of steel had been continuously increasing over the past few years, especially in 1958, when a great leap forward was achieved, but the growth of labor productivity was not fast enough, mainly because the proportion of manual operation was large and there was a lot of repetitive labor in the production process. After reaching a consensus, the Party Committee decided that the entire plant would focus on actively finding ways to replace manual operation with machinery, improve the technological process, and improve labor organization, deeply mobilize the masses, resolutely implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and relying on self-reliance, and carry out a technical revolution movement. The purpose of this movement is to improve production with methods that cost less, have better effects, and satisfy the masses.
    On January 19th, the Party Committee mobilized all the plant's employees. The workers, especially those engaged in heavy physical labor and manual operation, were in high spirits. After discussion, everyone was invigorated and full of fighting spirit. A massive upsurge of technical revolution to find problems, make suggestions, and offer advice quickly spread to every corner of the plant. Whether it was carrying, pushing, hammering, lifting, or sifting, people were thinking and using their brains everywhere to find ways to improve; some helped each other in twos and threes, and some thought independently. Everyone was looking for their own "revolutionary object" anytime, anywhere. Big-character posters, suggestion letters, and pledges poured into the Party Committee and workshop general branch offices in large numbers from various teams, sections, and workshops. According to preliminary statistics, the entire plant put forward more than 1,300 rationalization proposals from January 20th to 23rd.
    The hand-operated steel wire rope section of the metal products workshop used to have a large number of people and a large site, and all operations were manual. Workers had to walk the equivalent of 30 li (15 kilometers) back and forth in a 250-meter-long factory building every day for eight hours, the labor intensity was very high, and the production potential could not be fully exploited. This time, the employees designed and manufactured new tools overnight, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient manpower and materials. After a week of effort, four electric stranding machines were successfully installed on January 26th, replacing manual steel wire rope making. The last two are now being installed. According to preliminary calculations, this measure alone can save about 50% of labor, and production capacity can be increased from 2,100 tons per year in 1958 to more than 6,000 tons. Various steel rolling workshops are taking "fast rolling, multi-strip feeding" as the direction of technical revolution. The fifth steel rolling workshop is starting to manufacture a simple automatic lifting steam skid, replacing the heavy labor of using steam skids and large iron tongs to operate the rolling mill. In the past, six or seven people were needed per shift; according to the design, the automatic lifting steam skid only requires one person to hold the lifting switch in one hand and the pushing switch in the other, just like pushing a small cart, to easily send the steel ingot into the rolling mill. After this measure is implemented, the rolling speed can also be greatly accelerated.
    In order to carry out this movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, the Party Committee has specially established an office to strengthen leadership, headed by the Party Secretary and Plant Director, with three groups under it: investigation and research, professional (labor organization, technical equipment, rules and regulations), and propaganda and mobilization. Core groups have also been established in various workshops and teams accordingly. These organizations are actively sorting out the rationalization proposals put forward by the employees, and those that must be done and can be done are done immediately, and some are sorted out and formulated into plans separately. For major technical innovation measures, the Party Committee assigns Party Committee members to be responsible for them, and they go deep into the workshops and teams to study and solve problems together with the workers.

    群众运动的中心——技术革命
    上钢二厂自力更生、土洋并举大闹操作机械化
    本报上海11日电　一个以增产不增人、生产翻一番为目标，以逐步实现操作机械化为中心的技术革命运动，正在上海第二钢铁厂蓬勃展开。
    1月中旬，这个厂的党委会讨论了实现今年生产翻一番、保证完成更大跃进任务的问题。会上，有些人认为要实现今年的跃进计划，必须增加一千五百个工人。但是另外的人不赞同这种意见，他们认为，必须继续挖掘现有设备和劳动力方面的潜力。为此，厂党委专门组织了工作组，进行摸底。经过调查分析，发现几年来钢材的产量不断提高，特别是1958年获得了很大跃进，但是劳动生产率的增长不快，其主要原因是手工操作比重很大，生产过程中的重复劳动较多。认识趋于一致以后，党委决定全厂以积极设法用机械代替手工操作、改进工艺过程、改善劳动组织为中心，深入发动群众，坚决贯彻土洋结合、自力更生的方针，开展技术革命运动。这个运动的目的是要用花钱少、效果好、群众满意的办法提高生产。
    1月19日，党委向全厂职工进行了动员。工人们、特别是从事吃重的体力劳动和手工操作的工人，情绪都很高，经过讨论，人人精神奋发，个个斗志昂扬。一个声势浩大的找问题、提建议、献计策的技术革命热潮迅速遍及全厂各个角落。不论是对扛的、推的还是敲的、端的、筛的，人们处处打主意、动脑筋，设法改进；有的三三两两互助，有的单独思考。大家随时随地寻找自己的“革命对象”。大字报、建议书、保证书，从各班、工段、车间大批地涌向党委、车间总支办公室。据初步统计，全厂在1月20日到23日就提出了一千三百多条合理化建议。
    金属制品车间手摇钢丝绳工段，原来人多、场地大，全是手工操作，工人在二百五十公尺长的大厂房里，每天八小时来回要走相当于三十华里的路程，劳动强度很高，生产潜力不能充分发挥。这次职工们连夜设计制造新工具，克服人力、材料不足的困难，经过一周的努力，在1月26日安装成功了四台电动捻股机，代替人工制钢丝绳。现在正在安装最后两台。据初步计算，仅这一项措施，就可以节省劳动力50％左右，生产能力可以由1958年年产二千一百吨，提高到六千多吨，各轧钢车间以“快速轧制、多条喂钢”作为技术革命的方向。第五轧钢车间正着手制造简易自动升降汽撬机，代替原来轧钢机用汽撬、大铁钳操作的笨重劳动。过去每班需要六、七个人；按照设计，自动升降汽撬机只要一个人一手掌握升降开关，一手掌握推动开关，好像推小车一样，就可以轻便地将钢锭送进轧钢机。这项措施实现以后，轧钢速度还可以大大加快。
    为了有计划、有步骤地开展这一运动，党委专门成立了办公室来加强领导，由党委书记、厂长挂帅，下设调查研究、专业（劳动组织、技术设备、规章制度）、宣传鼓动三个小组。各车间、各班也相应地成立了核心小组。这些组织正在积极整理职工提出的合理化建议，必办而能办的马上就办，有的便分别整理、制定方案。对其中重大技术革新措施，党委指定党委委员分工负责，深入各车间、工段和工人一齐研究解决。　（马立民）
