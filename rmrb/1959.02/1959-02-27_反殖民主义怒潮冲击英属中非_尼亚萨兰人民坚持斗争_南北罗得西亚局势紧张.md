Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Salisbury: As the anti-colonialist wave in Nyasaland threatens to spread throughout the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the British colonial authorities declared a "state of emergency" throughout Southern Rhodesia on the 26th.

This new measure was announced by Southern Rhodesia Prime Minister Whitehead in a radio statement on the morning of the 26th. He also announced on behalf of the Federal Governor that four organizations of the African National Congress (nationalist organizations opposing colonial rule) were illegal. These four organizations are: the Nyasaland African National Congress, the Southern and Northern Rhodesia African National Congress, and the Northern Rhodesia Zambia African National Congress.

The colonial authorities announced that under the "state of emergency" in Southern Rhodesia, the authorities have the right to prohibit gatherings of more than three people, make arrests, control the movement of residents, enter and search any residence, declare curfews, and so on.

Before Whitehead announced this measure, Southern Rhodesia authorities had already taken "sudden action" at midnight on the 25th, arresting most members of the African National Congress offices.

When announcing this measure to suppress the African people's national independence movement, Whitehead admitted that this action was taken due to the tense situation in Nyasaland. The colonial authorities feared that this situation might also occur in Southern Rhodesia (which has the largest white population in the entire federation).

In Nyasaland, although the colonial authorities have been constantly transferring troops from Southern Rhodesia to suppress the people, the anger in the hearts of the Africans has not been extinguished, and the situation remains tense. On the 25th, about a thousand people demonstrated in the Longzu area of Nyasaland (nineteen miles from Blantyre). In Lilongwe, colonial troops opened fire during a mass demonstration on the 24th, killing two Africans. Reports say that the situation in this area is now close to a "boiling point."

At the Kariba Dam in Southern Rhodesia, the strike of 6,000 African workers continues, despite the authorities constantly sending more troops to suppress it. A spokesman for an Italian contracting company working on the dam said that while the strike appeared to be purely about wages on Tuesday, "there are certainly some political issues now."

According to reports from Northern Rhodesia, "unrest is growing" there. As the "general election" scheduled for March 20th approaches, a widespread rumor is circulating in the land that the Zambia African National Congress may try to prevent voters from going to the polls. Currently, Northern Rhodesia authorities are posting 60,000 notices, coercing Africans to vote.

The increasingly tense situation in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is deepening London's unease. The British government has formally announced to the House of Commons that the Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, is preparing to go to Nyasaland on the 26th.

Colonists in the neighboring regions of the federation are also deeply concerned. According to reports from Cape Town, these regions such as Uganda, Tanganyika, Mozambique, South West Africa, and especially the Union of South Africa "are watching the serious situation in Nyasaland with grave concern." Cape Town fears that "if open rebellions occur in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, there will be a chain reaction in neighboring regions." The Tanganyika colonial authorities have already dispatched troops and police to the border areas.

### 反殖民主义怒潮冲击英属中非  尼亚萨兰人民坚持斗争　南北罗得西亚局势紧张

    反殖民主义怒潮冲击英属中非
    尼亚萨兰人民坚持斗争　南北罗得西亚局势紧张
    新华社26日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：由于在尼亚萨兰掀起的反殖民主义统治的浪潮有波及整个罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦之势，英国殖民当局在26日宣布南罗得西亚全境处于“紧急状态”。
    这项新措施是由南罗得西亚总理怀特赫德在26日上午发表的一篇广播声明中宣布的。他还代表联邦总督宣布非洲人国民大会四个组织（反对殖民统治的民族主义组织）为非法组织。这四个组织是：尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会，南、北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会和北罗得西亚赞比亚非洲人国民大会。
    殖民当局宣布，在处于“紧急状态”下的南罗得西亚，当局有权禁止三人以上的集会、进行逮捕、控制居民的移动、可以进入和搜查任何住宅、宣布宵禁等等。
    在怀特赫德宣布这一措施以前的25日午夜，南罗得西亚当局即已采取“突击行动”，逮捕了非洲人国民大会办事处的大部分成员。
    怀特赫德在宣布这一镇压非洲人民族独立运动的措施时承认，采取这种行动是由于尼亚萨兰的紧张局势。殖民当局担心，这种局势也可能在南罗得西亚（它在整个联邦中是白种人最多的地区）发生。
    在尼亚萨兰，虽然殖民当局不断从南罗得西亚调遣军队前去镇压，但是，非洲人心中的怒火并未因此熄灭，局势仍然紧张。25日，在尼亚萨兰的隆祖地方（离布兰太尔十九英里），约有一千人举行了示威。在利郎格韦，殖民军在群众24日示威时曾经开枪，打死两名非洲人。消息说，现在这一地区的形势已经接近“沸点”。
    在南罗得西亚的卡里巴水坝，六千名非洲工人的大罢工仍在坚持中，虽然当局不断增派军队前去镇压。一名在这个水坝上工作的意大利承包公司的发言人说，虽然在星期二看来这次罢工纯粹是关于工资问题，“但是现在肯定有一些政治问题”了。
    据来自北罗得西亚的消息说，那里的“不安正在增长”。随着这一地区定于3月20日举行的“普选”日益接近，在这块土地上广泛流传着一种消息，赞比亚非洲人国民大会可能设法阻止投票人不要去投票。目前，北罗得西亚当局正在张贴六万张告示，胁迫非洲人去投票。
    罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦的形势日益加深伦敦的不安。英国政府已经正式对下院宣布，负责殖民事务国务大臣佩思准备在26日到尼亚萨兰。
    这个联邦的邻近地区的殖民者也忧心忡忡。据来自开普敦的消息说，这些地区如乌干达、坦噶尼喀、莫三鼻给、西南非洲特别是南非联邦“都以严重关切的心情注视着尼亚萨兰的严重局势”。开普敦方面担心，“如果南、北罗得西亚发生公开叛乱，邻近地区将发生连锁反应”。坦噶尼喀殖民当局已经把军队和警察派遣到边境地区去。（附图片）
