Seize the Key Season and Strive for a Bumper Harvest in Animal Husbandry
Hebei Province Arranges Animal Husbandry Production Three Months Early

(Our dispatch) In order to implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the general policy of comprehensively developing production, Hebei Province has arranged this year's animal husbandry production more than three months earlier than last year. From January 23rd to 28th, a provincial animal husbandry production conference was held in Pingxiang County (now called Julu County after merging with Julu County), an advanced county in large livestock breeding, to summarize the province's advanced experience and determine the specific tasks and measures for this year's animal husbandry production. Cai Ziwei, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, attended the conference and delivered a report. He said that it is very meaningful for Hebei Province to start arranging animal husbandry production early this year, because only by starting early and doing a good job in spring breeding can we guarantee the completion of this year's comprehensive production plan.

The conference held in Julu County, Hebei Province, focused on studying how to strive for a greater leap forward in this year's animal husbandry production on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. Cadres and representatives from various regions who attended the conference carefully analyzed the favorable conditions and existing difficulties for developing animal husbandry production this year. With full confidence, everyone formulated a leap forward plan for this year's animal husbandry production, and determined the policy of simultaneously developing livestock quantity at a high speed and universally improving quality; accelerating the solution of the livestock power needed by agriculture and transportation; simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production; and focusing on collective raising for small livestock and poultry, supplemented by individual raising by commune members. In accordance with this policy, it is required that the number of large livestock should increase by 400,000 head more than last year, with a net increase rate of more than 10%; the number of pigs should reach 25 million, more than double that of last year; and the number of sheep should increase by 2.5 million, with a net increase rate of 40%. Corresponding targets have also been set for the development of other livestock.

The conference believes that the main measures to complete this task are to achieve ten requirements in the large-scale "mass and high-yield" competition: 1. The survival rate of large livestock breeding should be 85%; 2. The average live weight of fattening pigs should be 200 jin; 3. The breeding rate of sheep should be 100%; 4. Horses, cattle, and donkeys should be improved; 5. The milk production of first-generation hybrid dairy cows should be more than 3,000 jin per head per year; 6. The wool production of first-generation hybrid sheep should be 5 jin, the second generation should be 10 jin, and purebred rams should be more than 40 jin; 7. The average annual egg production per chicken should be 120, and ducks should produce more than 60 eggs; 8. Alfalfa should produce more than 2,000 jin of green hay per mu; 9. Each head of large livestock should have 1,500 jin of silage, and each pig should have 500 jin; 10. The entire commune's livestock should be regularly fed antibiotic feed, and the improvement and breeding of livestock and rapid fattening of pigs should be further promoted.

The conference also emphasized that spring is the key season for realizing this year's leap forward plan for animal husbandry production. Currently, we should immediately mobilize the masses to start working immediately, do a good job in maintaining weight, increasing weight, protecting pregnancy, and protecting piglets, and start spring breeding as soon as possible, linking one link to another and striving for a bumper harvest in animal husbandry without stopping.

Hebei Province's leap forward plan for animal husbandry production this year was put forward on the basis of summarizing the achievements and experience of last year's great leap forward. In the great leap forward movement in 1958, the number of pregnant female livestock in the province reached more than 750,000 head, an increase of 66% over 1957. Whether in grassland areas, mountainous areas, or plain grain-producing areas or cotton-producing areas, many basically full-pregnant counties and full-pregnant communes have emerged. Eleven counties and cities have achieved an annual net increase rate of more than 10% in large livestock. There has also been a large increase in pigs and sheep. Artificial insemination and the prevention and control of livestock diseases have also achieved unprecedented success. (Attached picture)

    抓紧关键季节争取畜牧大丰收
    河北省提早三个月安排畜牧生产
    本报讯　贯彻党的八届六中全会精神和全面发展生产的方针，河北省比去年提早三个多月安排了今年畜牧生产。1月23日到28日在全省大牲畜繁殖工作先进的平乡县（这县与巨鹿县合并，现称巨鹿县）召开全省畜牧生产会议，总结了全省的先进经验，确定了今年畜牧生产的具体任务和措施。中央农业部蔡子伟副部长参加了这次会议，并作了报告。他说：河北省今年及早动手安排畜牧生产是很有意义的，因为只有早动手搞好春季配种，完成今年的全面生产计划才有保证。
    河北省在巨鹿县召开的这次会议，集中地研究了如何在1958年大跃进的基础上争取今年畜牧生产更大跃进的问题。各地参加会议的干部和代表详细分析了今年发展畜牧生产的有利条件和存在的困难。大家信心百倍地订出了今年畜牧生产的跃进计划，确定了高速度发展牲畜数量和普遍提高质量并举；加速解决农业运输业所需要的畜力动力；积极发展自给性生产和商品性生产并举；小家畜家禽以集体饲养为主、社员个体饲养为辅的方针。贯彻这个方针，要求全年大牲畜比去年纯增四十万头，纯增率达到10％以上；猪只达到二千五百万口，比去年增长一倍以上；羊纯增二百五十万只，纯增率40％。其他牲畜的发展也都订了相应的指标。
    会议认为，完成这一任务的措施主要是：在大抓“大群丰产”竞赛运动中实现十大要求：一、大牲畜繁殖成活率85％；二、生猪育肥平均毛重二百斤；三、绵羊繁殖率100％；四、马、牛、驴改良化；五、杂交一代奶牛产奶量每头每年三千市斤以上；六、杂交一代羊产毛量五斤，二代十斤，纯种公羊四十斤以上；七、平均每只鸡年产蛋一百二十个，鸭产蛋六十个以上；八、苜蓿亩产青干草二千市斤以上；九、大牲畜每头青贮饲料一千五百市斤，猪五百市斤；十、全公社家畜经常喂抗菌素饲料，进一步开展满膘、满怀、大增、大养、大搞牲畜改良、育种和生猪快速育肥。
    这个会还强调提出：春季是实现今年畜牧生产跃进计划的关键时节，当前就应立即发动群众马上动手，作好保膘、增膘、保胎、保仔工作，及早开展春季配种，一环扣一环，一步不停地争取畜牧大丰收。
    河北省今年的畜牧生产跃进计划，是在总结了去年大跃进的成绩经验的基础上提出的。在1958年大跃进运动中，全省满怀母畜达到七十五万多头，比1957年提高66％，不论草原区、山区，还是平原粮区或棉产区，都出现了许多基本满怀县和满怀社。有十一个县、市大家畜全年净增率达到10％以上。猪羊也有很大的增加。人工授精、牲畜疫病的防治等，也都获得前所未有的成就。（附图片）
