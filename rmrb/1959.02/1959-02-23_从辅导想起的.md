    Thoughts Inspired by Tutoring
    Qin Li
    These past couple of days, a striking advertisement has appeared in the cultural and entertainment section of the newspapers: "Hubei Province Mass Art Tutoring Group to Give a Report-Back Performance in Beijing."
    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, those who have been showing their skills on our stages are no longer just professional artists. Performances by amateur groups temporarily formed by workers, peasants, soldiers, students... have added dazzling brilliance to the stage of blooming flowers. Watching the performance of the Hubei Province Mass Art Tutoring Group evokes the same feeling.
    This group, it is said, was formed to adapt to the situation of the great development of industrial and agricultural production in Hubei Province, to cultivate a large number of amateur literary and artistic backbone members, mainly workers and peasants, and to promote the great popularization of mass literary and artistic activities, and on the basis of popularization, to improve the quality of mass artistic activities. It is a tutoring organization composed of active participants in amateur literary and artistic activities and some professional literary and artistic cadres. They adopt the method of continuously absorbing and sending back amateur literary and artistic activists during the process of touring tutoring for training and cultivation. This is a new attempt among many different practices currently used to improve the quality of mass literary and artistic activities. The emergence of this group illustrates how urgently the vigorously developing mass amateur literary and artistic activities need tutoring and improvement.
    However, although the vast majority of our professional literary and artistic workers strive to meet this reasonable demand from the masses, there are still some who disregard their tutoring tasks. They have not seen that the process of tutoring mass amateur literary and artistic activities is a good opportunity for themselves to draw nourishment from the rich treasures of mass art and continuously improve.
    Throughout history, both in China and abroad, no great artist has failed to cherish the creative talents of the people. The great Russian composer Glinka said: "The people create music, the composer merely arranges it." This is worth pondering!

    从辅导想起的
    秦犁
    这两天，报上的文化娱乐广告栏里，出现了一则引人注目的广告：“湖北省群众艺术辅导团来京汇报演出”。
    去年全国大跃进以来，在我们的舞台上显身手的，已经不只是专业的艺术工作者，由工人、农民、战士、学生……临时组成的业余团体的演出，使百花齐放的舞台增添了耀人的光彩。看了湖北省群众艺术辅导团的演出，也有同样的感受。
    这个团，据说是为了适应湖北全省工农业生产大发展的形势，大量培养以工农为主的业余文艺骨干，和促进群众文艺活动的大普及，并且在普及的基础上提高群众艺术活动质量，由业余文艺活动积极分子和部分专业文艺干部组合而成的一个辅导组织。他们对业余文艺积极分子，采取在巡回辅导的过程中，不断吸收和不断输送回去的办法进行训练培养。这是目前为了提高群众文艺活动质量，许多不同做法中的一个新的尝试。这个团的产生，说明了蓬蓬勃勃开展的群众业余文艺活动，是多么迫切地需要辅导和提高。
    可是，我们的专业文艺工作者，虽然绝大多数人努力去满足群众这种合理的要求，也还是有人无视自己的辅导任务。他们没有看到辅导群众业余文艺活动的过程，正是自己从丰富的群众艺术宝藏中，吸取滋养不断提高的好机会。
    古今中外，没有一个艺术大师不珍视人民群众的创造才能。伟大的俄罗斯作曲家格林卡说过这样一句话：“创作音乐的是人民，作曲家不过把它编一下罢了。”这是值得我们深思的！
