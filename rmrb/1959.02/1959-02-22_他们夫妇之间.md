They are praised by everyone in Qiyang Machinery Factory, Cao Bingzhe and Li Yuzi, as model husband and wife.

Cao Bingzhe is a fitter in the assembly workshop of this factory, a model worker. Li Yuzi is also a fitter in the same workshop, and she only joined the factory last October. Cao Bingzhe was her mentor, and now she has also become a model worker.

Cao Bingzhe is a man of iron, with thick eyebrows and big eyes. His black work clothes can't contain his fiery enthusiasm. He walks with vigorous strides. No one can tell that he is a disabled veteran with a prosthetic left leg. This thirty-one-year-old fitter came to this factory at the end of 1957. Last year alone, he made several rationalization proposals, which improved the assembly efficiency of corn processing machines several times. At the beginning of this year, in order to produce 3,500 tractors in the factory, he designed and manufactured three simple machine tools by himself, and one of them has been installed.

Li Yuzi, this model worker, is not obvious at first glance. When I saw her, she was standing at the door with her six-month-old daughter on her back to greet us. She is a twenty-one-year-old young woman, tall, with a rosy face, healthy and gentle. When she sees a guest, she lowers her head and blushes, looking like a rural housewife who rarely leaves her home.

There is a story about Li Yuzi becoming a fitter. It was on October 10th of last year when Premier Kim Il-sung came to inspect this factory. Based on the factory's need to expand production, but the temporary difficulty in solving the labor force problem, he instructed the workers to mobilize their wives to work, and implement the method of husbands teaching their wives, guaranteeing instruction and learning, to train them into technicians.

Cao Bingzhe told Li Yuzi the news that night. The couple was happy all night. The next morning, Li Yuzi followed Cao Bingzhe into the factory. Li Yuzi is a brave general when it comes to technical barriers. During the day, she followed Cao Bingzhe to learn operations. At night, Cao Bingzhe taught her mechanical theory under the lamp. The few books on the kang table at home were her textbooks. Li Yuzi was eager to learn technology. She continued to read technical books after Cao Bingzhe fell asleep, and woke him up to ask questions when she encountered difficulties.

In order to take care of the housework of the more than 400 workers' family members who joined the work with Li Yuzi, the factory stipulated that they should work six hours a day, but Li Yuzi got up early and went to bed late every day to rush to do housework, and she must work eight hours every day. Cao Bingzhe also helped her to send and pick up children to and from the nursery, and cook at home.

In this way, less than three months after Li Yuzi started working, on January 3rd of this year, she was rated as a fourth-grade worker and a model worker. January 3rd was the first working day of this year. The couple got up in the middle of the night and rushed to the factory to fight for a day. Each of them did the work of three people and assembled a sunflower threshing and peeling machine as a New Year's gift to 1959.

Now, more than 400 new female workers in the factory are learning from Li Yuzi. (Attached picture)

    他们夫妇之间
    王玉章
    岐阳机械工厂里人人都夸奖曹秉哲和李玉子夫妻两口，说他们是夫妻模范，又是模范夫妻。
    曹秉哲是这个工厂装配车间的钳工，模范工人，李玉子也是同一车间的钳工，而且是去年10月才进厂，师傅就是曹秉哲，现在也成为模范工人了。
    曹秉哲是一条铁铸的汉子，浓眉大眼，一身黑工装包不住那浑身一团火似的干劲，走起路来迈着刚健的大步，谁也看不出他是一个左腿残废装着假腿的荣军。这个三十一岁的钳工，1957年末到这个厂，去年一年就提了好几个合理化建议，使得玉蜀黍加工机的装配效率提高了好几倍。今年年初为了厂内生产三千五百部拖拉机，他又自己设计、自己制造了三台简易机床，已有一台安装好了。
    李玉子这个模范工人乍一眼可看不出，我看见她时她正背着她的半岁的小女儿立在家门口迎接我们，她是二十一岁的青年妇女，高高的个儿，红润的脸，健康而温柔，见了客人低下头、红着脸，外表就像一个大门不出二门不进的农村家庭妇女。
    说起李玉子当钳工那还有一段故事。那是去年的10月10日，金日成首相来这个工厂视察，他根据厂内要扩大生产，但一时不好解决劳动力问题的情况，指示工人们把妻子动员出来作工，并实行丈夫教妻子包教包学的办法，把她们培养成技工。
    曹秉哲当天晚上就把这个消息告诉了李玉子，他们夫妻高兴了一夜，第二天一早李玉子就跟着曹秉哲进了厂。李玉子在技术关前是一员闯将，白天她跟着曹秉哲学操作，晚上曹秉哲就在灯下教她学机械理论，他们家里炕桌上那几本书就是她的课本。李玉子学技术心切，晚上等曹秉哲睡了她还在看技术书，遇到难题就又把曹秉哲叫醒来问。
    厂里为了照顾同李玉子一同参加工作的四百多名工人家属要作家务劳动，规定她们每天工作六小时，可是李玉子却每天起早睡晚把家务活赶着做了，每天一定要作八小时。曹秉哲也帮助她往托儿所送小孩，领小孩，在家作饭。
    就这样，李玉子参加工作后不到三个月，在今年1月3日就被评为四级工和模范工人。1月3日是今年的第一个劳动日，这一对夫妻半夜里就起了床，二人赶到厂里奋战一天，每个人作了三个人的工作，装配成了一架向日葵脱粒脱皮机，作为向1959年的新年献礼。
    现在，全厂四百多个新入厂的女工人正在向李玉子看齐。（附图片）
