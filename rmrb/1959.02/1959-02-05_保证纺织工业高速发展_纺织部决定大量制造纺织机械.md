Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Textile Industry recently decided that in 1959, it would simultaneously develop three aspects and mass-produce textile machinery in nineteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to equip the rapid advance of China's textile industry. The Ministry of Textile Industry pointed out that this is the key to ensuring the high-speed development of China's textile industry this year and next year. The three aspects are: existing textile machinery factories should tap their potential and expand production; a new batch of textile machinery factories should be built; and the machine repair equipment capabilities of textile factories should be fully utilized, and some machine tools should be made to arm themselves, and while repairing and assembling, some textile machines should be manufactured.

This year, the focus of national textile machinery production is on manufacturing cotton textile machinery. The planned number of spindles to be manufactured is much more than the total number of new spindles added nationwide since liberation. The number of looms will also increase significantly compared to last year. At the same time, equipment for wool, linen, silk textile, printing and dyeing, etc., will also be increased accordingly.

China's textile machinery manufacturing industry made great progress in 1958. The output of various major textile machinery increased by one times compared to 1957. Many new types of textile machinery were also successfully trial-produced, such as the Type 59 cotton opener, high-yield carding machine, high-speed drawing frame, three-roller simple large draft spinning frame, and G212 loom. The production efficiency of these new textile machines is 90% to several times higher than the original machines, and they can also save steel, reduce manufacturing workload, and reduce equipment investment. Therefore, the Ministry of Textile Industry has decided to produce them in batches in 1959.

Due to the bumper cotton harvest across the country in 1958, cotton production in 1959 will increase to about 100 million dan, providing abundant raw materials for the textile industry. At the same time, the national demand for cotton yarn and cotton cloth is constantly increasing, which requires the textile industry to accelerate its leap forward and meet the needs of the broad masses of people. Therefore, while relying on the existing textile equipment across the country to vigorously increase production, adding a large number of new equipment has become a very important task in this year's textile industry production.

The existing ten textile machinery factories in the country are the main force in manufacturing textile machinery. They have great production potential. According to calculations, as long as the masses of workers are mobilized and relied upon to tap production potential, and some factory buildings and equipment are expanded, these factories can increase their output by more than one times this year compared to last year. The Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory, which produces looms, had a historical highest daily output of eighty units. According to this year's plan, the daily output should be gradually increased to two hundred and forty units. This factory has assigned this year's production tasks to various workshops, sections, and groups, and mobilized the masses of workers to conduct production capacity assessments, identify weak links, and then organize workers to voice their opinions and debates, and take measures to solve them, so that production efficiency has been significantly improved. About one-tenth of the factory's two hundred groups have already reached a daily production level of two hundred and forty units.

For the more than twenty textile machinery factories that have been identified for new construction and reconstruction this year, the Ministry of Textile Industry requires them to be completed successively in the first half of the year, put into production in the second half of the year, and undertake part of the textile machinery manufacturing tasks. These factories are distributed in Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and other places. Most of them are currently building factory buildings, and some have completed civil engineering and are about to install equipment. The construction of these factories mostly adopts the principles of making do with whatever is available, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and starting with local methods first, so the construction speed is relatively fast.

This year, the machine repair workshops of textile factories across the country will, on the premise of not affecting the repair and assembly tasks, plan to manufacture a batch of textile machinery for the country.

    保证纺织工业高速发展
    纺织部决定大量制造纺织机械
    据新华社3日讯　纺织工业部最近决定，1959年要从三个方面同时并举，在十九个省、市、自治区内大造纺织机械，装备我国纺织工业大踏步前进。纺织工业部指出，这是保证我国纺织工业今年和明年高速度发展的关键。这三个方面是：现有纺织机械厂大挖潜力，扩大产量；新建一批纺织机械厂；充分发挥纺织厂机修设备的能力，并自制一部分机床武装自己，在修配的同时，制造一部分纺织机器。
    今年全国纺织机械生产的重点是制造棉纺织机械，计划制造的纺锭，比解放以来全国新增加纺锭的总和还多很多，织布机也将比去年增加很多；与此同时，毛、麻、丝的纺织和印染等设备，也将相应地增加。
    我国纺织机械制造工业，1958年有了很大的发展。各种主要纺织机械的产量，比1957年增长了一倍；还试制成功了许多新型纺织机械，如五九型清花机、高产量梳棉机、高速并条机、三罗拉简易式大牵伸细纱机和G二一二织布机等。这些新型纺织机械的生产效率，都比原来的机械提高90％到几倍，而且还可以节约钢材、减少制造工作量和设备投资，因此，纺织工业部已决定在1959年内成批地生产。
    由于1958年全国棉花大丰收，1959年棉花产量将提高到一亿担左右，为纺织工业提供了丰富的原料；同时，全国人民对棉纱、棉布的需求量不断增加，这就要求纺织工业加快跃进步伐，适应广大人民的需要。因此，在依靠全国现有纺织设备大力增产的同时，增添大批新设备就成为今年纺织工业生产中一项十分重要的任务。
    全国现有的十个纺织机械厂，是制造纺织机械的主力。它们的生产潜力很大。据计算，只要发动和依靠职工群众挖掘生产潜力，并扩建一部分厂房设备，这些工厂今年可以把产量比去年提高一倍以上。生产织布机的上海中国纺织机械厂，历史上最高日产量为八十台，按照今年的计划，日产量要逐步提高到二百四十台。这个厂今年把生产任务交给各车间、工段、小组，发动职工群众进行生产能力查定，从中发现薄弱环节，再组织职工鸣放辩论，采取措施解决，使生产效率显著提高。全厂二百多个小组，约有十分之一目前已经达到日产二百四十台的生产水平。
    对于已经确定在今年新建、改建的二十多个纺织机械厂，纺织工业部要求它们在上半年陆续建成，下半年投入生产，担负一部分纺织机械制造任务。这些工厂分布在四川、湖北、安徽、陕西、浙江、江西、广东、湖南、云南、新疆等地，目前绝大部分在建筑厂房，有的已经完成了土建工程，即将安装设备。这些工厂的建设，大多采取因陋就简、土洋结合、先用土法上马的方针，因而建厂速度较快。
    全国各地纺织厂的机修车间，今年都将在不影响修配任务的前提下，计划为国家制造一批纺织机械。
