    Beside the Police Box
    At six o'clock in the morning, the sky was just beginning to lighten, and the number of pedestrians on the road gradually increased. Large and small vehicles, fully loaded with goods, sped back and forth. At this time, Xu Wencai, a traffic policeman from Shanghai, arrived at his police box. He focused his attention on every pedestrian and speeding vehicle, constantly switching the traffic lights. Suddenly, the figure of an old woman flashed past him. He turned around and found a small white package placed beside his police box. What was this? He opened it and found two large pancakes wrapped around two fragrant fried dough sticks. They were still warm! He watched the back of the old woman, who had already walked away, with gratitude.
    The old woman, named Bai Dayue, lived in the building behind Xu Wencai's post. For two years, the old woman had been caring for Xu Wencai like her own children. On rainy days, she would bring him raincoats and rain boots; in winter, she would bring him piping hot refreshments to his duty station; in the hot summer, she would bring him a cup of strong tea or sugar water on time; on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, she would bring a box of mooncakes to Xu Wencai's post. The old woman said, "If I have anything special, I won't feel good if Xu Wencai doesn't eat it."
    It was no accident that Xu Wencai was so loved by the old woman. She could see his daily work situation clearly from her small building. She saw that this young man was so concerned and caring for the pedestrians passing by, often helping the elderly and children cross the road. His handling of traffic violations was patient, serious, and kind. She personally saw Xu Wencai use his body to stop a truck, rescuing an old woman from danger who was about to be hit by the vehicle. When a worker's child went missing, he spent three days and three nights, searching after work, and finally found the child. When the old woman herself fell ill and didn't pass by Xu Wencai's post for two days, he rushed to the old woman's house after work to see her, accompanied her to see the doctor, and tried every means to run to many shops, finally buying the candied kumquats that the old woman wanted to eat... After a long period of observation, the old woman came to the conclusion: he is a loyal, enthusiastic, and responsible people's policeman.

    岗亭旁
    早晨六点钟，天刚麻麻亮，马路上行人渐渐多起来了，满载着货物的大小车辆，川流不息地奔驰着。这时，上海市交通警察徐文彩来到了自己的岗亭。他全神贯注地注视着每一个行人和飞奔的车辆，不时扳动红绿灯的开关。突然，一位老妈妈的身影从他身边闪过，他一转身，发现在他的岗亭旁放了个小白包，这是甚么东西？打开一看，是两张大烙饼卷着两只香喷喷的油条。还是热的呢？他怀着感激的心情望着已经走远了的老妈妈的背影。
    老妈妈叫白大月，住在徐文彩岗哨后面的楼上。两年来，老妈妈像关心自己的子女一样关怀着徐文彩。雨天她送来雨衣雨靴；冬天她把滚烫的热点心送到他值班地方；酷热的夏季，她按时送来一杯浓茶或糖开水；在中秋佳节的夜晚，她又把一盒月饼送到徐文彩的岗位上。老妈妈说，我有点甚么稀罕的东西，徐文彩不吃我心里不舒服。
    徐文彩这样受到老太太的爱护，并不是偶然的。他每天的工作情况，老太太在小楼上都看得一清二楚。她看到这个青年小伙子，对过往的行人是那样的关心和爱护，经常扶老携幼过马路，处理违章事故又是那样的耐心严肃而又和蔼，她亲眼看见徐文彩用身子拦住卡车，把一个险遭车撞的老妈妈，从危急中抢救出来。一个工人的孩子走失了，他花了三天三夜的时间，下了班就去找，终于给找了回来。老妈妈自己生病了，两天没经过徐文彩的岗亭，他下了班就赶到老妈妈家里来看望她，陪她去看病，并想尽办法跑了很多店，到底买来了老妈妈想吃的金桔饼……。老妈妈经过了长期的观察，得出了结论：他是一个忠诚、热心、工作负责的人民警察。　　（张蕴秀）（附图片）
