Xinhua News Agency, February 17th—The newly appointed Romanian Ambassador to China, Zaharescu, accompanied by diplomatic officials from the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong today.

In his congratulatory speech, Ambassador Zaharescu said: The comprehensively developing friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China demonstrate the common determination of socialist brotherly countries to continuously strengthen their unity. Ambassador Zaharescu said: In recent times, personal contact between the leaders of our two countries has had a positive impact on further deepening mutual understanding between our two peoples and enhancing their friendship and cooperation. The agreements signed between our two countries, economic, cultural, and scientific exchanges, are in line with the fundamental interests of our people and contribute to the socialist construction of our two countries.

In his reply, Chairman Mao Zedong said: In recent years, the friendly cooperation between China and Romania in the political, economic, and cultural fields has made great progress. The Chinese people sincerely thank the Romanian people for the support and assistance they have given to our country's socialist construction.

Chairman Mao Zedong said that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are based on proletarian internationalism and are therefore unbreakable. I firmly believe that on the broad road of socialist construction and courageous advancement towards communism for the peoples of our two countries, this sincere friendship and cooperation will be increasingly consolidated and developed; this will help to enhance the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will contribute to the noble cause of world peace and human progress.
