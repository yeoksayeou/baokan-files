Title: Lament

Gubani Jilian crossed the ocean, his ambition was not small,
Crossing the ocean, he came as a robber;
Others are heartbroken, but he smiles,
His withered hand, holding a machete.
This event, even the clouds in the sky cannot forget,
My troubled heart certainly cannot forget it.
The tree trunks are cut down, the grasslands are cleared,
Iron ore and pearls are transported to foreign lands.
Crossing the ocean again, black people's tears become rivers,
Herded onto ships in groups, suffering in the West.
This event, even the clouds in the sky cannot forget,
My troubled heart certainly cannot forget it.
Black people are captured and forced to do hard labor,
Sent to foreign lands, to mine and dig tunnels.
The whip is merciless, always showing its cruelty.
Once a black slave lies down, alas, his life is over.
Crossing the ocean again, we two walk alone:
What accompanies me is the sorrow of my kind.
This event, even the clouds in the sky cannot forget,
My troubled heart certainly cannot forget it.

### 悲歌

专栏：

    悲歌古巴尼·纪廉穿洋过海，野心不小，穿过海洋，来了个强盗；别人伤心，他却微笑，干枯的手，拿着棒刀。这件事连天上的云也忘不了，我苦闷的心当然没法把它忘掉。树干被砍断，草地被铲光，铁矿和珍珠运到了他乡。穿洋又过海，黑人泪成江，成群押上船，受苦到西方。这件事连天上的云也忘不了，我苦闷的心当然没法把它忘掉。黑人被捉走，强迫做苦工，送到他乡土，开矿掘地洞。鞭子最无情无时不逞凶。黑奴一躺下，呜呼一命终。穿洋又过海，我俩单独走：伴随我的有，同类的哀愁。这件事连天上的云也忘不了，我苦闷的心当然没法把它忘掉。
    谜语五则早晨在他的牙齿上，黑夜在他的皮肤上。是谁呀？不是谁呀？
              ——黑人。她是女的，但一点都不漂亮，她命令你怎样做你就得怎样做。是谁呀？不是谁呀？
      ——饥饿。（注）他是奴隶们的奴隶，又是主人们的暴君。是谁呀？不是谁呀？
            ——甘蔗。左手给予的时候大宣传，右手从来不会停止掠夺。是谁呀？不是谁呀？
            ——施舍。学会了装出笑脸，但却暗暗地痛哭流涕。是谁呀？不是谁呀？
                ——我。
    〔注〕饥饿在西班牙文是阴性名词。
    〔编者附记〕昨日本版纪廉诗“绿色的长蜥蜴”题目下“外二首”三字应取消。
