    Launch Revolutionary Emulation Drives on a Large Scale
    Zeng Zhi
    On the agricultural front last year, many places successfully utilized an important method of promoting the mass movement for socialist construction: launching lively and enthusiastic revolutionary friendship emulations between regions, communes, and production teams. This kind of emulation kept people consistently highly motivated with soaring enthusiasm, and allowed many advanced experiences to be promoted and improved more quickly and effectively. Thus, it played a considerable role in the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    Now, as the earth returns to spring, revolutionary friendship emulations are being launched on a larger scale and with greater momentum. Take a look at the newspapers these days: Yangzhong County in Jiangsu Province took the lead in setting up a challenge stage, proposing friendship emulations to all counties and cities in the province, striving to become a county with 1,000 jin of wheat per mu. The counties of Suzhou Prefecture immediately accepted the challenge, and soon many counties and cities followed Yangzhong's example, the wave of acceptance quickly resounding throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, along the coast of the Yellow Sea, and across the Xu-Huai Plain, with the results of manure accumulation and field management rapidly expanding. In Hubei, twenty-four counties and cities have already been involved in paired and league competitions. People are high-spirited and full of energy, seeking out emulation partners, aiming to compare their achievements in this year's grain and cotton production, commune income, completion of procurement tasks, and mass line working methods. In Jiangxi, Fuzhou Prefecture, which became the province's first 1,000-jin prefecture last year, took the lead in launching a challenge. Now, six prefectures and more than eighty counties across the province have issued challenge letters and submitted acceptance forms to each other. Emulation between communes and production teams in various places is even more widespread. This emulation drive to strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year has become a huge driving force for thousands upon thousands of commune members to overcome frost and difficulties, advance towards fertilizer, and improve field management and sideline production.
    Why does emulation produce such powerful strength? First, it is because the purpose of this emulation is noble. The common goal of everyone is to continuously advance our socialist construction cause, not for a region, a commune, or a production team to "stand out." Everyone is striving for common progress, not for developing themselves by defeating opponents. In short, this emulation is a revolutionary friendship emulation, not the cutthroat competition of capitalist society. Second, it is because this method of emulation sets up an opposing side for each participating region, commune, team, and even individual, and defines a goal to strive for. The direction of advancement for each region, commune, and team is very clear. This facilitates the organization of forces, boosts morale, maintains constant enthusiasm and soaring fighting spirit, and constantly inspires everyone to go all out and strive for the top. Emulation plays the role of mutually spurring and urging forward progress.
    The purpose and role of revolutionary friendship emulation determine the new type of relationship between the participating parties: both opponents and friends and comrades. As opponents, they must set high aspirations, strive for the top, and make the greatest effort to surpass each other; as friends and comrades, they must unreservedly pass on their advanced experiences to each other and find ways to help each other when they encounter difficulties. That is to say, both parties participating in revolutionary friendship emulation must have a communist style, helping, encouraging, and promoting each other for the sake of the common cause. In last year's emulation, many moving examples have already emerged. In the emulation between Nanxiong in Guangdong and Ganxian in Jiangxi, they sent "ambassadors" to each other, exchanged information, openly shared their "strategies and tactics," mutually sent and borrowed "east winds," and supported each other, joining hands to climb the leap forward stage together. This is one example. Zhang Qiuxiang, a national model cotton grower from Shaanxi Province and China's first female agricultural scientist, unreservedly passed on her cotton growing techniques to her emulation opponent, helping her opponent overcome the difficulties encountered in production so that the opponent could catch up with her. This is another example. Their actions show that they have a deep understanding of the essence of revolutionary friendship emulation and that they are people with communist consciousness. With the many shining examples of achieving a great leap forward through great emulation and great collaboration last year, even more moving examples will surely emerge this year.

    大规模开展革命竞赛  
    曾志
    在去年的农业战线上，许多地方成功地运用了推进社会主义建设的群众运动的一个重要方法——在地区和地区、社和社、队和队之间，开展轰轰烈烈热热闹闹的革命友谊竞赛。这种竞赛使人们经常保持着旺盛的斗志，冲天的干劲；并且使许多先进经验得以更快更好地推广和提高。这样，就对农业生产大跃进起了相当大的作用。
    现在，正当大地回春的时候，革命友谊竞赛又以更大的规模、更壮的声势开展起来了。请翻开这几天的报纸看一看：江苏省扬中县首先摆开了擂台，向全省各县市提出友谊竞赛，要力争成为三麦千斤县。苏州专区各县立即应了战，紧接着许多县市都向扬中看齐，应战的声浪很快就响遍了大江南北、黄海之滨和徐淮平原，积肥造肥、田间管理的战果正在迅速扩大。在湖北，已有二十四个县市卷入了对赛和联赛。人们意志昂扬、精神焕发，互找竞赛对手，要在今年的粮棉产量、公社收入、完成征购任务和群众路线的工作方法上比高低。在江西，由去年成为全省第一个千斤专区的抚州专区，首先发起了挑战。现在，全省六个专区、八十多个县相互下了挑战书，递了应战表。各地社与社、队与队之间的竞赛，就更多了。这场为争取实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的竞赛，已经成为千千万万公社社员战胜冰霜、战胜困难向肥料进军、搞好田间管理和副业生产的巨大动力。
    竞赛为什么会产生这样强大的力量？首先是由于这种竞赛的目的是高尚的。大家的共同目的是推动我们社会主义建设事业不断前进，而不是为了一个地区、一个公社、一个生产队“出人头地”。大家都是为了共同进步，而不是为了用打倒对手的办法发展自己。一句话，这种竞赛是革命的友谊竞赛，而不是资本主义社会的倾轧竞争。其次，是由于竞赛这种方法，为每个参加竞赛的地区、社、队以至个人都设置了对立面，确定了奋斗目标，每个地区、社、队进军的方向都非常明确。这就便于组织力量，鼓舞士气，经常保持饱满的热情和旺盛的斗志，随时都鼓足干劲、力争上游。竞赛起了互相鞭策、督促前进的作用。
    革命友谊竞赛的这种目的和作用，就决定了参加竞赛的双方的新型关系：既是对手，又是朋友和同志。是对手，就要立大志，争上游，尽最大的努力超过对方；是朋友、同志，就要毫无保留地把自己的先进经验传授给对方，就要在对方困难的时候设法帮助对方。也就是说，参加革命友谊竞赛的双方，都要有共产主义风格，为了共同的事业而互相帮助、互相鼓舞、互相促进。在去年的竞赛中，已经出现了许多动人的事例。广东南雄和江西赣县在竞赛中，互派“大使”，互通情况，互相公开自己的“战略战术”，互送互借“东风”，互相支援，并肩携手同上跃进台。这是一例。陕西省的全国植棉模范，我国的第一个女农业科学研究员张秋香，毫无保留地把自己的务棉技术传授给自己的竞赛对手，帮助自己的对手战胜生产中遇到的困难，使对手能迎头赶上自己。这又是一例。他们的行为说明：他们深刻地认识了革命友谊竞赛的本质，他们是具有共产主义觉悟的人。有了去年在大竞赛、大协作中实现大跃进的许多光辉的榜样，今年一定会更多地出现这种动人的事例。
