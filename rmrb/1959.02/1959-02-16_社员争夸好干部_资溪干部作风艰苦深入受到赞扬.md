    The People's Daily News: Jiangxi Province's Zixi County, during the commune consolidation, commune members put up more than 11,000 big-character posters praising cadres at all levels, and more than 300 cadres were rated by commune members as excellent cadres or model cadres. After being praised by the commune members, the cadres worked even harder and went deeper, actively leading the commune members to stride forward along the victorious path of 1958.
    In Zixi County's Great Leap Forward last year, thanks to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity displayed by cadres at all levels, going up mountains and down to the countryside, going deep into the fields and workshops, eating, living, and working with the commune members, and actively relying on and leading the broad masses to overcome various difficulties, an unprecedented leap forward in industrial and agricultural production was achieved. For example, in order to adapt to the natural conditions of cold water and short sunshine, the cadres went deep into the mountain fields to investigate and research, found ways to transform cold water fields, and led the commune members to launch a movement to transform low-yielding fields, actively promoting advanced yield-increasing measures such as converting mid-season rice to early-season rice and appropriately dense planting, which were generally considered unsuitable for mountainous areas, resulting in a great bumper harvest of grain last year, an increase of one and a half times compared to 1957. Under the specific leadership of cadres at all levels in the county, the county's farmers also built more than 350 various factories and mines centered on the iron and steel industry from scratch, with an output value of nearly 4 million yuan.
    These unprecedented achievements deeply moved the commune members throughout the county. During the rectification and airing of views stage of the commune consolidation, they all rushed to put up big-character posters to praise the cadres' hard-working style, everyone praised the cadres for their good leadership, saying they were "good sons and daughters of the Communist Party, good servants of the people." Commune member Gong Jianmei of Gaofu Brigade, Gaofu Commune, wrote in a big-character poster praising the brigade party branch secretary, Comrade Zeng Tianhua: "Secretary Zeng has good ideas and can handle all kinds of work; Secretary Zeng has a good attitude, is kind and not arrogant to people; Secretary Zeng has a high level of awareness, works hard and practically and makes contributions." 70% of the big-character posters put up by this brigade praised the cadres. In particular, the commune members were even more moved after more than 360 party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists took on the generally considered lowly work of canteen cooks and administrators. A big-character poster from Liyuan Team, Luyang Commune, praised: "The cadres are really good, the food is sweet and fragrant, the bowls and chopsticks are clean and the tables and benches are bright, and the commune members eat with great enthusiasm." Ding Duantian, the production team leader of Yufang, Wushi Commune, took the lead in braving the wind and snow to go up the mountain to transport charcoal, so that the commune members had charcoal to warm themselves on snowy days. Commune member Ding Shugui said with emotion: "The cadres educated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really good, they don't care about themselves and think only of the people."
    After being praised by the commune members, the cadres throughout the county worked even more actively, and with full confidence, organized and led the people of the county to engage in a tense struggle to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. In the past month, the amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied per mu has increased from more than 140 dan before praising model cadres to 500 dan, an increase of more than 30 times compared to the same period in 1958. The daily accumulation of fertilizer has surged from 200,000 to 300,000 dan to 1.3 million dan. The cash income from forestry and sideline occupations has increased from more than 350,000 yuan to more than 650,000 yuan, an average of 80 yuan per household. The cadres of Lusheng Brigade led the commune members to launch a socialist labor competition, organize a ring competition, and launch a campaign to contribute ideas and gifts, setting off a new upsurge in winter production and tool reform. In two days, the masses themselves created more than 50 ox-drawn flatbed carts, single-wheel carts, and double-wheel carts, achieving transportation cart-ization ahead of schedule, increasing fertilizer delivery efficiency by more than 20 times, and accumulating more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer in one day.

    社员争夸好干部
    资溪干部作风艰苦深入受到赞扬
    本报讯　江西省资溪县各人民公社在整社中，社员贴出一万一千多张大字报表扬各级干部，有三百多名干部被社员评为优秀干部或模范干部。干部们在受到社员表扬以后，更加艰苦深入，积极领导社员沿着1958年的胜利道路大踏步前进。
    资溪县在去年的大跃进中，由于各级干部发挥了苦干、实干、巧干的精神，上山下乡，深入田间、车间，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，积极地依靠和领导广大群众战胜了各种困难，因而取得了工农业生产空前大跃进。例如：为了适应水冷、日照短的自然条件，干部深入山垅田里调查研究，找出了改造冷水田的办法，又领导社员展开了改造低产田运动，积极推广一般人认为不适宜于山区的中稻改早稻、适当密植等先进增产措施，使去年获得了粮食大丰收，比1957年增产一倍半。在全县各级干部的具体领导下，全县农民又白手办起了以钢铁工业为中心的各种厂矿三百五十多个，产值近四百万元。
    这些史无前例的成就，深深地感动了全县公社社员。他们在整社鸣放阶段，都争先贴出大字报表扬干部的艰苦作风，人人夸赞干部领导得好，说他们是“共产党的好儿女，人民的好勤务员”。高阜公社高阜大队社员龚检梅在夸赞大队党支部书记曾天华同志的大字报上写道：“曾书记思想好，样样工作都能搞；曾书记态度好，对人和气不骄傲；曾书记觉悟高，苦干实干立功劳。”这个大队贴出的大字报，有70％是夸赞干部的。特别是三百六十多名党团员和积极分子担任一般人认为低贱的食堂炊事员、管理员后，社员更为感动。泸阳公社里沅队社员的大字报赞扬道：“干部真正好，饭菜甜又香，碗筷干净桌凳光，社员吃得干劲强。”乌石公社余坊生产队长丁段田带头冒着风雪上山运木炭，使社员在风雪天有了木炭烤火，社员丁树贵感动地说：“共产党、毛主席教育出来的干部真正好，不顾自己，尽为人民着想。”
    全县干部在受到社员夸赞后，更加积极工作，信心百倍地组织领导全县人民为实现1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而进行紧张的斗争。近一月来，每亩积肥、施肥由表扬模范干部前的一百四十多担增加到五百担，比1958年同期增长三十倍以上，每天积肥由二、三十万担激增到一百三十万担。林、副业现金收入由三十五万多元增加到六十五万多元，每户平均达八十元。泸声大队的干部更领导社员开展社会主义劳动竞赛，组织擂台比武，发动献计献礼，掀起了冬季生产和工具改革新高潮。全队两天中，群众自己创造了牛拉平车、单轮车、双轮车五十多部，提前实现了运输车子化，送肥效率提高二十倍以上，一天中积肥十万多担。
