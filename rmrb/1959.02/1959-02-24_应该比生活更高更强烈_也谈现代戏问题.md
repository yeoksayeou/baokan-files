Should Be Higher and More Intense Than Life
——Also Discussing Modern Drama Issues
Ye ZhengLuo
In the past year, many modern dramas have appeared on the stage. They have timely reflected the enthusiastic revolutionary drive of the masses, and in turn, have encouraged people's labor enthusiasm. This is a commendable achievement in the theater community. In addition, it is worth noting that the authors of these dramas are not limited to professional playwrights. This is one of the reasons why a large number of dramas reflecting real life have emerged in the past year. Among the modern dramas, there are many good plays that have enriched China's theater scene with fresh content and diverse forms.

Among the large number of modern dramas that have emerged, there are also some relatively crude and bland works. There are, of course, many reasons for this. Some plays are poor because the authors have not gone deep into life and have not made deep observations of life. Some are also due to the authors equating the truth of life with the truth of art; in other words, playwrights simply move some phenomena in life directly onto the stage, thinking that they have reflected life. Of course, many authors still lack experience and cultivation in creation, and such shortcomings are unavoidable. Moreover, because the themes of these dramas come directly from life, they can also play a certain educational role for the audience, and we should give these works a full estimate. However, at the same time, we may as well offer some suggestions for the authors' reference, hoping that they can make better artistic processing of their works, so that the audience can be more moved and these plays can produce greater effects.

The relationship between life and art was explained very clearly by Chairman Mao in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": the life of the people is the only source of literature and art. It is no wonder that the scripts written by people who are divorced from life are not vivid, not real, or distort life. Because this kind of work is "water without a source, a tree without roots," of course, it is dry and lacks vitality. However, there are also many playwrights who are in the midst of fierce struggles day and night, and it cannot be said that they are divorced from life, but some of their works are not necessarily successful. What is the reason for this? I think one of the reasons is that the authors have not mastered the correct method of literary and artistic creation. Although the author understands that the hot struggle life is the source of literary and artistic creation, the life reflected in literary and artistic works (including dramas) should be higher, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than actual life. It is precisely because literary and artistic works such as dramas can concentrate life through artistic images, typify the contradictions and conflicts in them, and typify the characters, that they can more powerfully touch the hearts of the audience and promote their progress.

This reminds me of the modern drama "The White-Haired Girl," which is recognized as a good one (whether it is an opera or Peking opera). The authors of "The White-Haired Girl" did not deal with the situation of landlords oppressing peasants and peasants overthrowing landlords under the leadership of the Party in a general way. "The White-Haired Girl" used a special form to express the universal truth: the peasants in old China, although they did not all go into mountain caves like Xi'er, and did not eat the offerings of the Grandma Temple, they also lived inhuman lives like Xi'er. This script thus prominently exposes the crimes of the landlord class and the misfortune and struggle of the suffering people. Xi'er being rescued from the mountain cave and seeing the light of day is not a true portrayal of the emancipation of the broad masses of peasants? The story itself has strong romantic colors, but it also embodies the author's bold and creative processing of life phenomena. Goncharov once said, "Nature has a powerful force. If you directly depict it, you can only produce a small and weak copy. Nature only allows you to approach it through creative imagination." This is the reason why literary and artistic works should "artistically reflect life." This is also where realism differs from naturalism.

Another issue worth studying in current modern dramas is the adaptation of content and form. On this point, the Soviet "Drama" magazine editorial "The Playwright's Skills" (see "Wenyi Bao" Volume 4, No. 7) put it very well: "There are no and will not be any ready-made formulas for 'skills', because the playwright must seek anew each time an artistic form that is suitable for the new living material. The new living material that is written into the script dictates the style, genre, and structure of the new work." This statement is very good, and we should coordinate and unify content and form. Even if there is good content and good themes, if the form is not chosen properly and is reluctantly used to装进去, the result will be uncoordinated. Recently, at the Hangzhou literary and art circles' celebration of the 1959 New Year's Day gala, the award-winning children's literary and art programs were performed, and these programs gave me great inspiration: that is, many contents that fantasize about the future and praise the current life are expressed in the form of song and dance, which feels very good. For example, children on the stage use rhythmic dance postures and loud singing voices to beautifully perform the children's life of the new era: eliminating the four pests, agricultural labor, entertaining black children, fantasizing about the future and other scenes. I think if these themes were performed by Peking Opera, it would probably not be as good as this form. Of course, the forms of song and dance are also various and cannot become formulaic, and this must also be "each time seek anew an artistic form that is suitable for the new living material" to adapt to it. Therefore, I believe that for different types of dramas, it is not necessary to demand that they all achieve the same percentage of dramas that express modern life without distinction. If it is not suitable, there is no need to force it. As many comrades have mentioned, in terms of opera repertoires, we must walk on two legs. What's more, there are many dramas with strong ideological content in traditional opera, such as "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Killing the Family by the Lake," "Lin Chong Flees at Night," and "The Sad Story of Liang and Zhu," which not only give us aesthetic enjoyment, but also give us a powerful educational effect. The Party Central Committee advocates that the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" should be implemented in all literature and art, and this should naturally be the case in the theater community. Only in this way can we meet the needs of the broad audience with different preferences.

Of course, modern dramas must be vigorously developed to better reflect reality and educate the masses. How to improve the quality of modern dramas? In addition to the above-mentioned opinions, I feel that the common shortcomings of some relatively crude and bland modern dramas are that the characters are not vivid and their personalities are not prominent: Zhang San is almost the same as Li Si, and Li Si is similar to Wang Da. We should more seriously learn the methods of classical playwrights in portraying characters. The characters of Li Kui, Wu Song, Lin Chong, Cao Cao, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhuge Liang, Liang Shanbo, and Guo Yuzhi in traditional dramas give people a sense of individuality, liveliness, and vividness. In my personal opinion, some scripts are unsuccessful probably because the playwrights write the characters in life into the script in the same way, simply dividing the lines between advanced characters and backward characters, and then connecting them with stories, without further generalizing the characters' personalities and shaping them more prominently and clearly. Although the characters in the drama come from real life, the playwright has the right to transform them so that they can more truly and deeply reflect real life (it is certainly not necessarily bad to write with real people and real events). The real life reflected in this way is not just an approximation of the surface phenomenon, but reflects the basic characteristics of real life and the essential aspects of real life. Only in this way can the content of the work be more concentrated and more ideal, and can the reality of revolutionary struggle and the fantasy of a great future be naturally combined. In our dramas, we can better achieve the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

In order to improve the quality of modern dramas, the language should also be further improved. I think the refined language in traditional dramas is worth learning from. In many excellent traditional dramas, the character's personality can often be pointed out in a few words, and it is humorous and lively, strongly attracting the audience's attention. For example, the dialogue in the Sichuan opera "Judging Snow and Identifying Traces," the language of Guo Yuzhi in the Kun opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," and the banquet scene between Chen Shimei and Wang Chengxiang in the Yue opera "Qin Xianglian" are all truly precious, closely related to the character's personality, and also guide the plot to a climax. In this regard, modern drama authors should not only learn from traditional drama how to use language correctly and lively, but also learn more from the vivid language of the masses. The language used in "The White-Haired Girl" is a model of learning from the language of the masses and the language of traditional drama. For example, the lyrics sung by Mu Renzhi when he appeared in the first act portrayed the face of the lackey, and it was closely linked to the rent collection below; in the third scene, Uncle Zhao said to Yang Bailao: "It doesn't matter if we die, but we can't harm the children." It made Yang Bailao, who had put his fingerprint on the document, have the idea of suicide. This sentence seems unimportant, but it is related to the changes in the entire script plot. Such rigorous and reasonable selection of language and use of language can make the artistic form more perfect.

    应该比生活更高更强烈
    ——也谈现代戏问题
    叶征洛
    去年舞台上出现了不少现代戏，它们及时地反映了群众热火朝天的革命干劲，又反过来鼓舞了人们的劳动热情，这是戏剧界一项值得庆贺的成绩。另外，值得注意的是，这些戏剧的作者不限于专业的剧作者，这是去年出现大量反映现实生活的戏剧的原因之一。在现代戏中，有不少好的剧目，它们以新鲜的内容和多样化的形式繁荣了我国戏剧园地。
    在大量涌现出来的现代戏中，也有一些较为粗糙平淡的作品。其所以这样，原因当然是很多的。有一些戏较差是由于作者没有深入生活，对生活没有深刻的观察之故。也有一些是由于作者将生活的真实和艺术的真实等同起来之故；换句话说，就是剧作者简单地将生活中的某些现象，直接搬到舞台上，就认为已经反映了生活。当然，不少作者在创作方面还缺少经验，缺少修养，这样的缺点是难免的。而且，由于这些戏剧的题材直接来自生活，对观众也能起一定的教育作用，我们应该给这些作品以充分的估计。但是，同时我们也不妨提出一些意见来供作者们参考，希望他们对作品进行更好的艺术加工，使观众能够受到更大的感动，使这些戏产生更大的效果。
    生活和艺术的关系，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，作了极其明白的说明：人民群众的生活是文学艺术唯一的源泉。脱离生活的人写出的剧本之所以不生动、不真实或者歪曲了生活，是不足怪的。因为这种作品是“无源之水，无本之木”，当然干瘪而缺乏生命力。但是也有不少剧本的作者，朝夕处身于火热的斗争中，不能说他们脱离生活，可是他们所创作的某些作品，也不一定就成功，这是什么缘故呢？我以为原因之一还是在于作者没有很好地掌握文艺创作的正确方法。作者虽则理解了火热的斗争生活是文艺创作的源泉，但文艺作品（包括戏剧）反映出来的生活，应该比实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想。正因为戏剧等文艺作品能够通过艺术形象把生活集中地反映出来，将其中的矛盾和冲突典型化，把人物典型化，所以就能更有力地打动观众的心弦，推动他们前进。
    这里使我想起被公认为好的现代戏“白毛女”（不论是歌剧或是京剧）。“白毛女”的作者，并不将地主压迫农民、农民在党的领导下打倒地主的情况作一般化的处理。“白毛女”却借特殊形式表现了普遍的真理：旧中国的农民，虽然没有像喜儿那样全进山洞，没有吃奶奶庙的供果，但也和喜儿一样过着非人生活。这个剧本就是这样突出地暴露了地主阶级的罪恶和苦难人民的不幸和斗争。喜儿被救出山洞而见天日，不正是广大农民翻身的真实写照吗？这个剧本的故事本身，虽然具有强烈的浪漫色彩，但也体现出作者对生活现象大胆地加以创造性的加工的作用。冈察洛夫曾这么说过：“大自然有着强大的力量。如果直接描摹它，便只能产生出渺小无力的复写。大自然只允许通过创作的想像来接近它。”这就是说文艺作品要“艺术地反映生活”的道理。这也是现实主义有别于自然主义的地方。
    目前现代戏中另一个值得研究的问题，是内容和形式相适应的问题。关于这点，苏联“戏剧”杂志社论：“剧作家的技巧”（见“文艺报”第四卷第七期）一文中讲得很好：“任何‘技巧’的成方是没有而且也不会有的，因为剧作家必须每次重新寻求合于新的生活材料的艺术形式，这写入剧本的新的生活材料就规定着新作品的风格，体裁和结构。”这个讲法很好，我们应该使内容和形式协调和统一起来。即使有好的内容、好的题材，如果形式选择得不适当，勉强用来装进去，结果就会不协调。最近杭州市文艺界庆祝1959年元旦联欢晚会上，演出了得奖的少年文艺节目，这些节目给我很大的启发：即有许多幻想将来、歌颂目前生活的内容，用歌舞的形式来表现，就觉得很好，比如小孩子们在舞台上，用富有节奏的舞蹈姿势和嘹亮的歌声优美地表演出新时代的儿童生活：除四害、农业劳动、招待黑人小朋友、幻想将来等场面。我想，这些题材如果由京剧来演，恐怕就比不上这种形式。当然，歌舞的形式也形形色色，不能流于公式，这也得“每次重新寻求合于新的生活材料的艺术形式”来适应它才行。因此，我认为对于不同的剧种，不必无区别地要求它们在表现现代生活的剧目上一律要达到同样的比例数字。不适宜的，不必勉强。正如不少同志们所提到的，在戏曲剧目上，必须两条腿走路。何况传统戏剧中有许多思想性很强的剧目，如“十五贯”、“打渔杀家”、“林冲夜奔”、“梁祝哀史”等，不但给我们美的享受，也给我们强有力的教育作用。党中央提倡在一切文学艺术中要贯彻“百花齐放”的精神，在戏剧界自然也应该这样。也唯有这样，才能满足爱好不同的广大观众的要求。
  当然，现代戏必须努力发展，使它更好地反映现实，教育群众。如何来提高现代戏的质量呢？除上述的意见外，我感到目前一些比较粗糙平淡的现代戏的普遍缺点，是人物形象不鲜明，性格不突出：张三和李四差不多，李四又和王大相像。应该更加认真地向古典剧作家学习刻划人物的方法。传统戏剧中李逵、武松、林冲、曹操、关羽、张飞、诸葛亮、梁山伯、过于执等人物给人一种各具个性、生动活泼的感觉。依我个人想来，有些剧本之所以不成功，大概是由于剧作者将生活中的人物依样画葫芦地写入剧本，简单地划分先进人物、落后人物的界线以后，用故事把他们串连起来就算了事，没有将人物的性格进一步地概括，塑造得更为突出明朗。戏剧中的人物虽来自真实的生活，但剧作者有权利将他们加以改造，使其更能真实、深刻地反映现实生活（用真人真事来写，当然也并不一定不好）。这样反映出来的现实生活，不只是表面现象的近似，而是反映了现实生活的基本特征，反映了现实生活的本质方面。也只有这样，作品的内容就更集中、更理想，能将革命斗争的现实和对伟大未来的幻想，很自然地结合起来，在我们的戏剧中，就能更好地做到革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的结合。
    为了提高现代戏的质量，在语言方面，也应该进一步地提高。我认为传统戏剧中的精炼的语言，是值得我们学习的。在许多优秀的传统剧目中，往往不消三言两语，就能点明人物的性格，而且风趣生动，强烈地吸引观众的注意力。如川剧“评雪辨踪”中的对话，昆剧“十五贯”中过于执的语言，越剧“秦香莲”中陈世美和王丞相宴会的场面，真是字字珠玑，既紧扣人物性格，也将剧情导向高潮。在这方面，现代戏作者不但要向传统戏剧学习怎样正确、活泼地使用语言，而且也要多多学习群众的生动的语言。“白毛女”里所使用的语言，就是学习群众语言和传统戏剧语言的模范。如第一幕一段穆仁智出场时的唱词，就将狗腿子的脸嘴刻划出来，而且紧紧和下面的讨租相连；第三场赵大叔对杨白劳说：“咱们死了没什么，可不能害了孩子。”就使在文书上盖了指印的杨白劳萌自杀的念头，这句话看起来似乎无关紧要，却牵连到整个剧本情节的变化。这样严格而合理地选择语言，运用语言，可以使艺术形式更加完美。
