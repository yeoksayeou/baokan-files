    A Detailed Account of the Great Victory of the Soviet Basketball Team
    Defeating the American "Overlord" in the World Basketball Championship
    (Our dispatch) The Soviet basketball team defeated the United States team by a score of 62 to 37 on January 28 in the World Basketball Championship held in Santiago, the capital of Chile.
    The Soviet team faced its strongest American opponent this time. The American players were all veterans of international competitions, with an average age of 25 and an average height of 1.91 meters. At the beginning of the game, the Soviet team launched a quick and powerful attack on the American team. Initially, the American team was able to cope勉强应付, but soon people noticed that the American players were nervous, missed shots repeatedly, and lost the ball when passing. In the first six minutes, the score was six to four, with the Soviet team leading. At eight minutes, the American coach asked for a timeout because the score had become 12 to 14, and replaced Captain John Jeager into the game. This was his first appearance in this World Basketball Championship. This was the American team's trump card, specially reserved for him to conserve his energy in order to compete against the Soviet team. However, John Jeager's entry had no effect; instead, it disrupted the American team's rhythm, and he was taken off the court after one and a half minutes.
    In this brief moment, the Soviet team combined effective offense with strong defense and had already gained nine points. In the last three minutes of the first half, Soviet player Krumin, who is 2.18 meters tall, came on the court, which consolidated the Soviet team's advantage and gained another four points. At this point, the Soviet team led 25 to 14 in the first half.
    After the break, as soon as the game started, the Soviet team scored repeatedly, and the distance between the two teams' scores became larger and larger. When it reached 38 to 18, both teams requested substitutions. The American coach used the one-minute respite to instruct the players to change from zone defense to man-to-man marking. But this was of no avail, because the Soviet team's movements were very agile. Five minutes before the end of the game, the score was already 47 to 25. The American team's defeat was simply beyond redemption. At this time, the audience was amazed. People did not expect the Soviet team to have such a clear advantage. Although people had expected the Soviet team to put up a tenacious resistance against the American team before the game, no one had expected the American team to suffer such a crushing defeat, but the facts are always the facts. The Soviet team finally defeated the American team 62 to 37. At the end of the game, more than 20,000 spectators celebrated the Soviet team's victory with stormy applause. The American team, however, was so embarrassed and angry that it violated the convention and left the arena without congratulating the Soviet team.
    In this game, every member of the Soviet team acted accurately and decisively, defeating the American team, which has been known as the world basketball "overlord" for more than 20 years, and writing a glorious page for the Soviet sports cause.

    苏联篮球队大捷纪详
    在世界篮球锦标赛中击败美国“霸王”
    本报讯　苏联篮球队1月28日在智利首都圣地亚哥举行的世界篮球锦标赛中以62比37打败了美国队。
    苏联球队这次遇到的是最强的美国对手，美国队员都是国际比赛中的老手，他们的平均年龄是二十五岁，平均身长是一九一公分。比赛一开始苏联队就以快速强攻美国队。起初，美国队还能勉强应付，但不久人们就发现美国队员神经紧张，连连投空，在传球时失球。在最初六分钟，比数为六比四，苏联队领先。到八分钟时，美国队教练因比数已成为12比14要求暂停，换队长琼杰腊德入场。他在这次世界篮球赛中是第一次出场。这是美国队专门为了使他养精蓄锐，以便与苏联队比赛时拿出来的王牌。但琼杰腊德的上场，没有任何效果，反而使得美国队步调混乱，上场一分半钟后又退场了。
    苏联队在这短短的时刻中，用有效的进攻和坚强的守卫相结合，已取得了九分。在前半场的最后三分钟内，身高二点一八公尺的苏联选手克鲁明出场，这样使苏联队巩固了优势，又再获得了四分。至此，前半场苏联队以二十五比十四领先。
    休息后，比赛一开始，苏联队就连连得分，两队分数的距离越来越大，到三十八比十八时，两队都要求换人。美国教练利用了一分钟的喘息时间，要队员们由防卫改成盯人的战术。但这无济于事，因为苏联队行动十分敏捷。在场终前五分钟，比数已成四十七比二十五。美国队败局根本已无法挽回。这时观众惊奇不已，人们没想到苏联队竟会占这样明显的优势。虽然在比赛前人们预料苏联队将给美国队以顽强的抵抗，但美国队会遭如此惨败，是没有人料到的，但事实总是事实。苏联队最后以六十二比三十七打败了美国队。场终时，两万多观众以暴风雨般掌声庆贺苏联队获胜。而美国队竟恼羞成怒，违反惯例，没有向苏联队祝贺就离开了比赛场。
    在这次比赛中，苏联队每个人的行动都准确果断，击败了二十多年来号称世界篮球“霸王”的美国球队，为苏联体育事业写下了光辉的一页。
