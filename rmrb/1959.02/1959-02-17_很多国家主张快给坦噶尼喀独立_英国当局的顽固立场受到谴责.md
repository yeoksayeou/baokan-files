    Many Countries Advocate for Granting Tanganyika Independence Quickly
    The Stubborn Stance of the British Authorities is Condemned
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch – The United Nations Trusteeship Council concluded its discussion on the British government's report on the situation in its trusteeship territory of Tanganyika on February 12th. Many representatives, in their speeches, severely condemned the policies pursued by the British authorities, demanding that Tanganyika be granted independence as soon as possible.
    The report submitted by Britain did not explain the true situation in this African region, and did not even mention that a specific date must be set for granting Tanganyika independence. The British authorities continue to stubbornly insist that "due to the lack of trained personnel," Tanganyika is not yet ready to implement measures aimed at achieving independence.
    Representatives of other colonialist countries supported the position of the British government.
    Representatives from Asia, the Near East, and the Soviet Union opposed Britain's position. They emphasized that Tanganyika must be granted independence as soon as possible.
    Soviet representative Kurdyukov, in his speech at the meeting, drew everyone's attention to the British authorities' blatant discrimination against local residents in political life, economic activities, employment of workers, and labor remuneration, etc.
    The Soviet representative suggested setting a maximum time limit of five years for Tanganyika to achieve complete autonomy.
    The Trusteeship Council established a committee consisting of representatives from Italy, India, New Zealand, and the Soviet Union to draft a resolution based on the report under discussion.

    很多国家主张快给坦噶尼喀独立
    英国当局的顽固立场受到谴责
    据新华社讯　联合国托管理事会在12日结束了对英国政府关于它的托管地坦噶尼喀状况的报告的讨论。许多代表在发言中严厉谴责英国当局推行的政策，要求尽快给予坦噶尼喀独立。
    在英国提出的报告中并没有说明非洲这一地区的真实情况，甚至没有提到必须规定给予坦噶尼喀独立的具体日期。英国当局继续顽固地坚持，“由于缺乏受过训练的干部”，在坦噶尼喀还不准备实行目的在于实现独立的措施。
    其他殖民主义国家的代表支持英国政府的立场。
    亚洲、近东以及苏联的代表反对英国的立场。他们强调指出，必须尽快让坦噶尼喀独立。
    苏联代表库尔久科夫在会上发言时提请大家注意英国当局在政治生活、经济活动、雇佣工人和劳动报酬等等方面对当地居民所进行的粗暴歧视。
    苏联代表建议规定五年作为坦噶尼喀获得完全自治的最大期限。
    托管理事会成立了一个由意大利、印度、新西兰和苏联的代表组成的委员会，根据所讨论的报告起草决议。
