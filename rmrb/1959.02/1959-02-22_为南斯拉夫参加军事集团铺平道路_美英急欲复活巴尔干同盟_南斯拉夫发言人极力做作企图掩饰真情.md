    To Pave the Way for Yugoslavia to Join Military Blocs
    US and Britain Eager to Revive the Balkan Alliance
    Yugoslav Spokesman Strives to Disguise the Truth

    (Reported by this newspaper) The "Indian Times" reported that the US and Britain are attempting to pull "Yugoslavia into the Western military blocs against the Soviet Union." Therefore, the US and Britain "urgently feel" the need for reconciliation between Greece and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, thereby paving the way to achieve the aforementioned goal and restoring the Balkan Pact as soon as possible. The newspaper also revealed that Tito will visit Greece at the end of the month.
    The "Indian Times" reported on the 13th:
  “In the West's view, the recent spirit of reconciliation between Greece and Turkey, generated by the Cyprus agreement, is a good omen for the revival of the Balkan Pact. The purpose of the economic assistance promised by the United States and Britain to Yugoslavia is obviously to lure Tito back into the Balkan military bloc.”
    Both Greece and Turkey are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an aggressive treaty, and Turkey also participates in the Baghdad Pact. On February 28, 1953, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey signed the "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation," establishing the Balkan Alliance. In recent years, due to the dispute between Greece and Turkey over the Cyprus issue, this alliance has been almost completely stagnant.
    According to a Yugoslav News Agency report on the 13th: When answering questions about the restoration of the Balkan Pact at a press conference held in Belgrade on the 13th, Yugoslav Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Konci did not deny these reports. He said: "I cannot say that these reports are arbitrarily and maliciously linked together by someone."
    This spokesman forcefully argued for Yugoslavia's participation in the Balkan military bloc, claiming that Yugoslavia does not participate in any bloc, saying: "We only regard the Balkan Pact as a tool for peaceful cooperation in economic, cultural, and other aspects between the three countries."
    The spokesman, perhaps realizing afterwards that his actions still could not conceal the inside story of the Balkan Alliance's reorganization, restated on the 20th that the three countries' "defensive military alliance" is "no longer effective in practice."
    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 20th: After ending talks with Britain and Turkey on the Cyprus issue on the 19th, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis once again advocated the revival of the Greek-Turkish-South (Yugoslav) Balkan Pact at a press conference. He said that the agreement reached by the three countries on Cyprus "should lead to the restoration of the Balkan Pact."
    He also said that he will meet with Yugoslav President Tito in Athens on March 1.

### 为南斯拉夫参加军事集团铺平道路  美英急欲复活巴尔干同盟  南斯拉夫发言人极力做作企图掩饰真情

    为南斯拉夫参加军事集团铺平道路
    美英急欲复活巴尔干同盟
    南斯拉夫发言人极力做作企图掩饰真情
    本报讯　“印度时报”报道，英美正企图拉“南斯拉夫参加对付苏联的西方军事集团”。因此，英美“迫切感到”希腊和土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上有必要实行和解，从而为达到上述目的铺平道路，及早恢复巴尔干条约。这家报纸还透露，铁托将在月底访问希腊。
    “印度时报”13日的报道说：
  “在西方看来，希腊和土耳其最近因塞浦路斯协议而产生的和好精神是巴尔干条约复活的良好预兆。美国和英国答应给予南斯拉夫的经济帮助的目的，显然是在于拉拢铁托回到巴尔干军事集团。”
    按希腊和土耳其都是北大西洋公约组织侵略条约的成员国，土耳其还参加了巴格达条约。1953年2月28日，南斯拉夫、希腊、土耳其签订了“友好与合作”条约，成立了巴尔干同盟。近几年来，由于希腊和土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上的争执，这个同盟几乎完全处于停滞状态。
    另据南斯拉夫通讯社13日报道：南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人孔奇13日在贝尔格莱德举行的记者招待会上回答有关恢复巴尔干条约的问题时没有否认这些消息。他说：“我不能说这些消息是有人随心所欲地和别有用心地联系在一起的。”
    这位发言人为标榜不参加任何集团的南斯拉夫参加巴尔干军事集团强辩说：“我们把巴尔干条约只看做是三国之间在经济、文化和其他方面实行和平合作的一个工具。”
    这位发言人可能由于事后发觉他这样做作仍不能掩饰关于巴尔干同盟重整旗鼓的内幕，他20日又重新声明，三国“防御军事联盟”“实际上不再起作用。”
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：希腊首相卡拉曼利斯19日在结束同英国和土耳其关于塞浦路斯问题的会谈后，又在记者招待会上鼓吹复活希、土、南（斯拉夫）巴尔干条约。他说，三国就塞浦路斯达成的协议“应导致巴尔干条约的恢复”。
    他还说，他将在3月1日在雅典同南斯拉夫总统铁托会见。
