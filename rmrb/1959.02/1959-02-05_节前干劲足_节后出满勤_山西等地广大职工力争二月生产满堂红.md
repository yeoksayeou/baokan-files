Joyful Spring Festival, booming production
High spirits before the festival, full attendance after the festival
Workers in Shanxi and other places strive for a red February in production

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd. Factories and mines in Shanxi Province are launching a mass movement to ensure normal attendance and good production before and after the Spring Festival.

At the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, "Heroic Battle Platforms" and "Achievement Boards" have been set up everywhere, where workers post big-character posters, guaranteeing no absenteeism before and after the Spring Festival, and striving for a "red" production record after the festival. They believe that February is a crucial month to complete the first quarter's production tasks successfully. To compensate for the impact of the Spring Festival holiday on production, they have decided to step up production in the days before the Spring Festival. Currently, most of the factory's technical personnel and staff have gone to workshops and teams to help solve technical and business problems, while also participating in labor production.

Coal miners in the production teams (groups) of the Fenxi Mining Bureau have been actively formulating plans to ensure normal attendance before and after the Spring Festival. Their guarantees include: all those participating in repairs and production during the Spring Festival holiday will be present, completing the repair tasks on time, with quality and quantity assured; workers not participating in repairs will return to work on time after the holiday, to increase the production of coking coal to supply the steel industry.

"Passengers first, ourselves second," is the slogan put forward by the railway system workers. Employees at the Taiyuan Station have decided to change from three shifts to two shifts during the busy Spring Festival passenger and freight transport period, and increase the number of mobile ticket sales teams from four to ten. Employees of the Taiyuan Public Transport Company have decided not to take holidays during the Spring Festival and to postpone the evening closing time.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th. In order to ensure the completion of the task of manufacturing 220 new freight cars in February, workers at the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant have put forward the fighting slogan of "Guaranteeing high spirits before the festival, working in shifts during the holiday, and full attendance after the festival," and have launched a competition to strive for a bumper February.

At the beginning of February, workers expressed their determination to complete the task, and each workshop put forward guarantees. The "May Fourth" Youth Pioneer Group workers proposed: seizing every second to make freight cars, guaranteeing full attendance before and after the Spring Festival, and resolutely guaranteeing the completion of the tasks related to the manufacture of 120 new freight cars within twelve days. After completing the forging tasks for 120 new freight cars, workers in the Forging Workshop proposed to work hard for a few more days before the Spring Festival to complete the forging tasks for 100 new freight cars. When the supply of castings for the upper process of the freight car and mechanical assembly and processing workshops could not keep up, they automatically organized sand blasting teams and transportation teams to help the foundry workshop blast sand and transport parts.

While arranging holiday production, the factory actively arranged the holiday life of the workers in terms of meals and recreational activities, so that the workers working in shifts in the factory could have a good Spring Festival.

    新华社太原3日电　山西省各厂矿单位，正在开展一个保证春节前后正常出勤、搞好生产的群众运动。
    太原矿山机器厂到处搭起了“英雄会战台”和“战果牌”，职工们纷纷在这里贴出大字报，保证春节前后不缺勤，做到节后生产满堂红。他们认为要完满地完成第一季度的生产任务，2月份是关键月。为了弥补春节假期对生产的影响，决定要在春节前的几天内加劲生产。现在，全厂技术人员和职员大部分下到车间、小组，帮助解决技术上和业务上的问题，同时参加劳动生产。
    汾西矿务局各生产队（组）的煤矿职工，纷纷订出春节前后保证正常出勤的计划。他们提出的保证是：利用春节假期参加检修的和生产的要全部出勤，按时按质按量地完成检修任务；不参加检修的职工，休假期满就按时出勤，以增产焦煤，供应钢铁工业。
    “先旅客后自己”，这是铁路系统职工提出的口号。太原站职工决定在春节客、货运输繁忙期间，由三班改为两班倒，把流动售票组由四个增加到十个。太原市公共汽车公司职工决定春节不休假，并且推迟晚上收车的时间。
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　哈尔滨车辆厂的职工为了保证2月份完成二百二十辆新造货车任务，提出“保证节前干劲足、假期轮班干、节后出满勤”的战斗口号，掀起了争取2月份大丰产的竞赛热潮。
    2月份一开始，职工们就纷纷表示完成任务的决心，各车间都提出保证条件。“五四”青年先锋小组工人提出：分秒必争，向时间要货车，春节前后出满勤，坚决保证十二天内完成一百二十辆新造货车的有关任务。锻冶车间职工在完成了一百二十辆新造货车的锻件任务以后，又提出春节前再苦战几天，完成一百辆新造货车的锻件任务。货车和机械组装加工车间的工人，当上工序铸件供应不上时，就自动组织打砂队、运输队，帮助翻砂车间打砂和运输部件。
    在安排假日生产的同时，这个厂积极地从伙食、文娱活动等方面安排了职工的假日生活，让在厂轮班工作的职工过好春节。
