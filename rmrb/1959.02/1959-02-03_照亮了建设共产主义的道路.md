Soviet Correspondence:

    Illuminating the Road to Building Communism
    By Our Correspondent Li Nan
    During the days of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Moscow has been blessed with clear weather, and the sunlight often shines on the marble pillars of the Grand Kremlin Palace. The standing statue of Lenin is bathed in bright light, and his wise eyes gaze upon the spring colors filling the entire hall.

    On the opening day of the Congress, as Comrade Khrushchev was delivering his report, the sunlight shone directly into the conference hall. Comrade Khrushchev paused and looked at the window, saying, "You see, we were just talking about heavy industry, and the sun began to shine brightly. This symbolizes that nature is also happy for our achievements. The sun illuminates the path of our seven-year plan." At this point, enthusiastic applause broke out in the hall.

    The Congress has been going on for several days, and every day the delegates rush to the Kremlin to discuss this great program for building communism and express their determination. One by one, they step onto the solemn rostrum, and with excitement and pride, they say that the ideal of communism, the ideal of millions of people, is no longer a distant matter, but is about to become a reality in the lives of the Soviet people. Many gray-haired old Bolsheviks sitting in the delegate seats and the audience are often moved to tears when they hear these words, as the goal they have struggled for throughout their lives is about to be achieved.

    The Congress has illuminated the Soviet Union's path to communism—this is the delegates' unanimous assessment of the Congress. The Soviet Union has the material and spiritual conditions to fully carry out communist construction—this is the delegates' unanimous report from all over the country. The delegate from Latvia said that although Latvia entered socialism twenty years later, its production level is already the same as other republics. The delegate from Kazakhstan said that a few years of effort have turned Kazakhstan into the granary of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the electricity produced by Kazakhstan alone has greatly exceeded the level of all of Russia before the revolution.

    In his speech, the delegate from Belarus said that Belarus used to be a backward region, but now the production of tractors, automobiles, and cutting lathes, calculated per capita, has exceeded that of all countries in Europe. The delegate from the Sverdlovsk region said in his speech that the total industrial output of this region has increased seventy-eight times compared to 1913, and the machine industry has increased eight hundred times. The representative of the Communist Youth League reported that 35,000 work teams have already participated in the competition to become communist labor work teams. When one hears that the output of many industrial products in Rostov Oblast alone has exceeded that of Tsarist Russia, and that the iron ore production in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast alone has exceeded the total of Great Britain, Japan, and Sweden, how can one not be excited! From these facts, people see that the light of communism is getting closer and closer.

    The atmosphere of the Congress is joyful, and at the same time, solemn. The speeches of the delegates not only expressed joy, but also gave calm and serious consideration to future tasks.

    The brilliant prospects of communism, the great plan for building communism, have inspired the strength of the people. Listen, delegates from all over the country, one by one, stepping onto the podium, solemnly announcing at this solemn Party meeting that the Party organizations and people in various places must realize this program with round-the-clock labor. Listen, how many people are discussing the seven-year long-term plan in various places! Twelve million in Ukraine, two million in Kazakhstan, three million industrious and heroic Soviet people in Belarus, under the call of the Party, have unanimously risen up.

    At the 21st Party Congress, the delegates' hearts are filled with excitement. The Ukrainian delegation guaranteed that some sectors of the seven-year plan would be completed in five or six years, and agriculture would be completed in five years. The delegate from Ryazan guaranteed that the meat production target of the seven-year plan would be completed in two or three years. The delegates from the collective farms guaranteed that the entire seven-year plan for the collective farms would be realized in four or five years. The worker delegates guaranteed that they would mine more coal, smelt more iron, manufacture more machines, and build more enterprises. Outside the meeting hall, on the vast Soviet land, from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean, from the distant Far East to the Baltic coast, the people's emotions are boiling, and everyone's heart is towards the Party Congress and the Kremlin. Everywhere in Moscow, one can feel the great passion of the people, and everywhere people are talking about the Congress, praising the seven-year long-term plan. In the past few days, hundreds of enterprises in Moscow have held mass rallies. Nikitin, a worker at the Moscow Automobile Factory, said at a mass rally that the 21st Congress marks a milestone in world history, marking a new stage in human life. The thought that we have fully entered the stage of communist construction makes my heart beat faster. The voices from the Kremlin have spread to all parts of the country, and the shepherds in the high mountain pastures of the Tianshan Mountains have heard this voice. An old Kyrgyz shepherd, Ismalov, was excited when he heard the news of the 21st Congress on the radio. He said that a bright and broad road is stretching out in front of the Soviet Union, and our dear Party is leading us forward to the pinnacle of human happiness. The builders in the Karakum Desert heard the good news, and the builders welcomed the Congress by completing a 400-kilometer canal ahead of schedule. Thousands of telegrams and letters are pouring into the Kremlin from all over the country. At the meeting on the 30th, the telegram from the Tatar oil workers was specially read out, announcing that they had discovered two major oil-producing areas on the day of the meeting, and this telegram caused enthusiastic applause. The delegates said that the earth's core is also opening its arms to welcome the seven-year plan! Comrade Khrushchev said that the first swallows of spring have appeared, which heralds a beautiful and bright summer. A group of spring swallows of the seven-year long-term plan have already flown up. This is the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket, this is the Soviet Union's nationwide competition to welcome the 21st Congress, this is the determination of the people in various places to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule, all of which shows that the heroic Soviet people are striving forward, climbing the golden and splendid peak of communism, climbing the peak of human social development, and advancing victoriously towards communism under the leadership of the Party.

    照亮了建设共产主义的道路
    本报记者　李楠
    在苏共第二十一次代表大会进行工作的这几天，莫斯科都是晴朗的天气，阳光时时射在大克里姆林宫会议厅大理石的柱子上。列宁的立身塑像浴着明亮的光辉，他的睿智的眼光注视着整个大厅充满的春天的色彩。
    在大会开幕的那一天，当赫鲁晓夫同志正在报告的时候，阳光正好射入了会议大厅。赫鲁晓夫同志停顿了一下看了看窗户说道：“你们看，我们刚刚谈到重工业，太阳就开始发出耀眼的光芒。这象征着大自然也在为我们的成就高兴。太阳照亮了我们七年计划的道路。”这时会场上响起热烈的掌声。
    大会进行了几天了，每天代表们匆匆地走到克里姆林宫去讨论这个建设共产主义的伟大纲领，表达自己的决心。他们一个个走上庄严的讲台，怀着激动和自豪的心情说共产主义这个千千万万人的理想已不是遥远的事情了，它就要变成苏联人民生活中的现实。坐在代表席上和旁听席上的许多白发苍苍的老布尔什维克，听到这些地方往往感动得流出泪来，他们一生奋斗的目标就要达到了。
    大会照亮了苏联走上共产主义的道路——这是代表们对大会的一致评价。苏联已经具备了全面开展共产主义建设的物质和精神的条件——这是各地代表们对大会的一致报告。拉脱维亚的代表说，拉脱维亚虽然迟进入社会主义二十年，但生产水平已经和其他共和国一样了。哈萨克斯坦的代表说，几年的努力已使哈萨克斯坦变成了苏联的谷仓。同时，单是哈萨克斯坦生产的电力已大大超过了革命前全俄的水平。
    白俄罗斯的代表在发言中说，白俄罗斯从前是个落后的地区，但现在拖拉机、汽车和切削车床的生产，按人口平均计算已超过欧洲的一切国家。斯维德洛夫斯克州的代表在发言中说，这个州的工业总产品比1913年增加了七十八倍，机器工业竟增长了八百倍。共青团的代表报告说，现在已经有三万五千个工作队参加了争取共产主义劳动工作队的竞赛。当听到仅罗斯托夫一个州的许多工业品产量已超过沙俄的产量，第聂伯彼得洛夫斯克一个州的铁砂生产已超过英国、日本、瑞典的总和时，人们怎能不兴奋呢！人们从这些事实中看到共产主义的光芒已经越来越近了。
    代表大会的气氛是欢乐的，同时又是庄严的。代表们的发言不仅表示了欢愉的情绪，而且还对未来的任务作了冷静的、认真的考虑。
    共产主义的辉煌远景，建设共产主义的伟大计划，把人民的力量鼓舞起来了。听吧，来自各地的代表们，一个一个地走上讲台，在这个庄严的党的会议上，隆重宣布各地党组织和人民一定要以夜以继日的劳动来实现这个纲领。听吧，各地有多少人在讨论着七年远景计划啊！乌克兰一千二百万、哈萨克斯坦二百万、白俄罗斯三百万勤劳英勇的苏联人民，在党的号召下已经一致奋发起来了。
    二十一次党代会的会场上，代表们的心情在激动着。乌克兰代表保证七年计划的一些部门要在五年或六年内完成。农业要在五年内完成。梁赞的代表保证要在两三年内完成肉类的七年计划，农庄的代表们保证要用四、五年的时间实现农庄的全部七年计划，工人代表们保证要采更多的煤，炼更多的铁，要制造更多的机器，修建更多的企业。会场外，在广大无边的苏联土地上，从黑海到北冰洋，从辽远的远东到波罗的海沿岸，人民群众的情绪在沸腾着，每个人的心都向着党代会和克里姆林。莫斯科到处可以感觉到人们巨大的激情，到处人们在谈论着大会，歌颂着七年远景计划。几天来莫斯科几百家企业都在举行群众大会，莫斯科汽车厂工人尼金在群众大会上这样说，二十一大在世界史上是标志着人类生活进入新阶段的里程碑，一想起我们已经全面进入共产主义建设阶段，心就在跳动。从克里姆林宫发出的声音传到了全国各地，远在天山高山牧场的牧羊人听到了这个声音。吉尔吉斯的老牧人伊斯马洛夫从无线电听到二十一大的消息，他激动地说，光明的康庄大道伸展在苏联的面前，亲爱的党领导着我们向人类幸福的顶点前进。在卡拉库姆沙漠里的建设者听到了这个喜讯，建设者用提前建成四百公里的运河来迎接大会。成千成万的电报和信件正在从全国各地涌向克里姆林宫。在30日的会议上特别宣读了鞑靼石油工人的电报，他们在会议进行的一天发现了两大石油产地，这个电报引起了热烈的鼓掌。代表们说，地心也在敞开胸怀迎接七年计划啊！赫鲁晓夫同志说，第一群春燕已经出现了，这预告着美好明媚的夏天，七年远景计划的一群春燕已经飞翔起来了，这就是苏联的第一支宇宙火箭，这就是苏联迎接二十一大的席卷全国的竞赛，这就是各地人民所表示的提前完成七年计划的决心，这一切表示着豪迈的苏联人民奋力向前，登上共产主义的金光灿烂的高峰，登上人类社会发展的高峰，在党的领导下向共产主义胜利前进。
