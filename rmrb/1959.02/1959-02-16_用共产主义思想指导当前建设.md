Using Communist Ideology to Guide Current Construction

According to the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, carrying out socialist and communist education correctly and comprehensively among all the people is the Party's urgent task at present.

Revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit must be unified. First, there must be a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, and on this basis, the spirit of seeking truth from facts must be promoted to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. Therefore, the primary task of socialist and communist education at present is to correctly and comprehensively publicize the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, vigorously publicize the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, publicize the superiority of the people's communes, and publicize the situation in 1959 and the task of achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. It is necessary to affirm achievements, analyze shortcomings, criticize various "doubts," prevent the rise of right-leaning conservative thought, protect and further develop the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and continue to inspire the revolutionary spirit of the masses. It is necessary to publicize materialism and dialectics. Exaggeration must be opposed, and alternating periods of intensity and relaxation must be combined, and reliability and activity must be unified. Opposition to exaggeration must never lead to the other extreme of not daring to do anything. Respecting objective laws is not about making people slaves to objective laws. It must be made clear that, for revolutionaries, full enthusiasm, lofty ideals, and vigorous spirit are the most fundamental qualities and the great driving force for the advancement of our cause, and this is entirely consistent with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. We must base all our work on conscientious investigation and research, and on discovering and applying objective laws, but all this can only be achieved by giving play to subjective initiative. The theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development must be unified. We are scientific communists. Communism has its own objective standards and necessary conditions. Therefore, it is obviously wrong to think that the standards of communism can be arbitrarily lowered or that it can be announced that we have entered communism at any time. Regarding the issue of building socialism and transitioning to communism, the Marxist-Leninist scientific communist theory opposes both the so-called "one-time transition theory" and the so-called "Great Wall of China between the two." We advocate uninterrupted revolution and affirm that the construction of socialism must prepare for the transition to communism. However, we also advocate that revolutionary development must have stages, and we insist that it can only be one revolution after another. It must be made clear to cadres and the masses that the main task of the Chinese people at present and for a considerable period of time to come is still to build socialism. Without the success of socialist construction, there will be no realization of communism. Therefore, the long-term goal of communism must be correctly related to and strictly distinguished from the current practice of socialism, and the growth of communist factors must be correctly related to and strictly distinguished from the transition to communism. It is necessary to continue to emphasize the superiority of the socialist system, publicize the great task of accelerating socialist construction, and publicize the socialist guidelines and policies; at the same time, inspire all the people with the great ideals of communism, educate all the people with communist ideas, and actively prepare conditions for the future transition to communism.

The socialist system and communist ideology must be unified, and socialist construction must be guided by the communist ideological system. Communism is a complete ideological system, including from worldview and methodology to work style. Its theoretical concentration is Marxism-Leninism. Socialist system plus communist ideology is the basic starting point for guiding all our work and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our various undertakings. The combination of communist ideology and the socialist system has two aspects of significance: on the one hand, it is for the victorious carrying out of the current socialist construction, and on the other hand, it is to prepare the spiritual conditions for the future transition to communism. Therefore, communist education should become the driving force for promoting the progress of all our work, and it is undoubtedly wrong to underestimate the significance of communist ideological education.

There are still some problems in handling the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the part and the whole. The collective ownership system still has a positive role at present, which must be affirmed; however, without communist ideology, the positive role of the collective ownership system cannot be fully developed, and the limitations of the collective ownership system cannot be overcome. Therefore, at present, a communist education with the opposition to departmentalism as the central content must be carried out in depth among cadres, so that they can fully recognize the harm of departmentalism, that departmentalism is absolutely incompatible with communism, that the individual obeys the collective, that the part obeys the whole, that the collective ownership nature of the people's commune and its inevitable transition to ownership by the whole people, and greatly promote the communist style.

The mass line is the Party's fundamental line and the lifeline of the people's commune. At present, it is particularly necessary to conduct propaganda and education on the mass line among cadres, and the Party's leading role must also be realized on the basis of following the mass line. The vast majority of our cadres serve the people sincerely. The problem with the work style of a few cadres is not good, and the large number of them have the problem of not being high enough, that is, not being good at adopting the method of the mass line to carry out work. But even so, we must still pay attention to one finger or less than one finger out of ten fingers. Because in the future, the work of leading the people's communes will be large in scale, many in aspects, heavy in tasks, new in problems, and high in requirements. It is difficult to do the work well if the work methods and leadership level cannot keep up. In order to implement the mass line, our cadres must earnestly establish the view and style of "consulting with the masses when something happens" and "treating the masses equally." After the rectification campaign and the socialist Great Leap Forward, the working methods of the mass line have been greatly enriched. We should further promote the Party's fine traditions on the basis of absorbing past experience, give play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people, and strive to achieve the great historical tasks put forward by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee!

### 用共产主义思想指导当前建设

    用共产主义思想指导当前建设
    根据八届六中全会决议的精神，在全体人民中间正确地全面地进行社会主义和共产主义的教育，是当前党的迫切任务。
    革命热情和科学精神必须统一。首先必须有高度的革命热情，在这个基础上发扬科学的求实精神，才能实现社会主义建设事业的更大更好更全面的跃进。因此，目前社会主义和共产主义教育的首要任务，就是要正确地全面地宣传八届六中全会决议的精神，大力地宣传1958年大跃进的伟大成就，宣传人民公社的优越性，宣传1959年的形势和实现更大更好更全面的跃进的任务，肯定成绩，分析缺点，批驳各种“怀疑论”，防止右倾保守思想的抬头，保护和进一步发挥群众的革命积极性，继续鼓舞群众的革命干劲。要宣传唯物论、辩证法的思想，浮夸必须反对，冷热必须相济，可靠和积极必须统一，反对浮夸决不能走到什么事情都不敢做的另一极端，尊重客观规律更不是要人们去做客观规律的奴隶。必须讲清楚，对于革命者说来，满腔的热情，崇高的理想，风发的意气，是最根本的素质，是我们事业前进的伟大动力，而这和实事
  求是精神是完全一致的。我们必须把一切工作放在认真调查研究、发现和运用客观规律的基础上，但是所有这一切又都只有通过发挥主观的能动作用才能实现。不断革命论和革命发展阶段论必须统一。我们是科学的共产主义者，共产主义有自己的客观标准和必备条件，因此认为可以任意降低共产主义的标准或者随时宣布进入共产主义，显然是不对的。关于建设社会主义和向共产主义过渡的问题，马克思列宁主义的科学共产主义理论既反对所谓“一次过渡论”，也反对所谓“两者隔着万里长城论”。我们主张不停顿的革命，肯定建设社会主义必须为过渡到共产主义做好准备。但是我们又主张革命发展必须有阶段的划分，坚持只能由一个革命到另一个革命。必须向干部和群众讲清楚：我国人民在目前以至今后相当长时期内的主要任务，仍然是建设社会主义，没有社会主义建设的成功，就不会有共产主义的实现。因此，必须把共产主义的长远目标和社会主义的当前实践正确地联系而又严格地区别开来，必须把共产主义因素的增长和向共产主义过渡正确地联系而又严格地区别开来。必须继续强调宣传社会主义制度的优越性，宣传加速社会主义建设的伟大任务，宣传社会主义的方针政策；同时用共产主义的伟大理想鼓舞全体人民，用共产主义思想教育全体人民，并且积极地为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。
    社会主义制度和共产主义思想必须统一，社会主义建设事业必须以共产主义思想体系作为指导。共产主义是包括从宇宙观、方法论直到工作作风的完整的思想体系，它的理论的集中表现就是马克思列宁主义。社会主义制度加共产主义思想，这是我们指导一切工作的基本出发点，也是我们各项事业取得胜利的根本保证。共产主义思想和社会主义制度相结合，有两方面的意义：一方面是为了胜利地进行当前的社会主义建设，一方面是为将来过渡到共产主义准备精神的条件。因此，共产主义教育应当成为推动我们一切工作前进的动力，低估共产主义思想教育的意义无疑是错误的。
    在处理个人和集体、局部和整体的关系上，还存在着一些问题。集体所有制目前还有积极作用，这点必须肯定；但是如果没有共产主义思想，就不能充分发挥集体所有制的积极作用，克服集体所有制的局限性。因此，目前必须在干部中深入地进行一次以反对本位主义为中心内容的共产主义教育，使他们充分认识本位主义的危害性，本位主义同共产主义绝不相容，认识个人服从集体，局部服从整个的道理，认识人民公社的集体所有的性质及其必然向全民所有制过渡的道理，大大发扬共产主义的风格。
    群众路线是党的根本路线，是人民公社的生命线。目前特别需要在干部中进行群众路线的宣传教育，党的领导作用也必须在走群众路线的基础上求得实现。我们的干部绝大部分是诚诚恳恳地为人民服务的，干部的作风少数是不好的问题，大量的是水平不高的问题，也就是不善于采取群众路线的方法进行工作的问题。但是即使如此，我们对于十个指头当中的一个指头或者不到一个指头，仍然必须重视。因为今后领导人民公社的工作，规模大，方面多，任务重，问题新，要求高，工作方法和领导水平不能够跟上去，是很难把工作做好的。为了贯彻执行群众路线，我们干部必须切实树立“有事同群众商量”、“平等对待群众”的观点和作风。经过整风运动和社会主义大跃进，群众路线的工作方法有了极其丰富的发展，我们应当在吸收过去经验的基础上，更加发扬党的优良传统，发挥全党全民的革命积极性，为实现八届六中全会所提出的伟大的历史任务而奋斗！
