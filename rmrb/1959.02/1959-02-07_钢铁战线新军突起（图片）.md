Since the mass campaign to make steel was launched last year, medium and small-sized iron and steel enterprises have been built in almost every province (autonomous region) on the vast land of the motherland—whether in the interior or border areas, plains or mountainous regions. Currently, some medium and small-sized steel plants that are not yet completed are accelerating construction, striving to join the ranks of production as soon as possible and fight to complete 18 million tons of steel.

    In 1958, the Hubei Iron and Steel Plant only had one blast furnace in production. It is currently continuing construction, striving to complete the remaining four blast furnaces, steelmaking, rolling steel, mining, and coking projects this year. In this way, the Hubei Iron and Steel Plant will initially become a medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprise. Xinhua News Agency reporters Deng Bangjun and Yang Limen photo

    钢铁战线新军突起
    自去年全民大办钢铁以来，在祖国辽阔的大地上——不论是内地或边陲、平原或山区，几乎是每个省（自治区）都兴建了中型的和小型的钢铁企业。目前，一些尚未完工的中小型钢铁厂正在加速建设，争取早日参加到生产的行列中，为完成1800万吨钢而战。

    湖北钢铁厂1958年只有一座高炉投入生产，目前正在继续建设，争取早日把其余四座高炉、炼钢、轧钢、采矿、炼焦等工程在今年竣工。这样，湖北钢铁厂就将初步成为一个中型的钢铁联合企业。　新华社记者　邓邦钧、杨礼门摄
