Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 5th. A brief meeting of the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests was held on the afternoon of the 5th. At the meeting, the United States and Britain brazenly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal that the Supervisory Committee adopt the principle of unanimity when voting on substantive issues. It is reported that when the conference discussed the voting method of the Supervisory Committee established under the treaty prohibiting nuclear tests, the Western representatives refused to seriously consider the Soviet proposal. Soviet representative Tsarapkin made this proposal last week at the request of the West. The Soviet Union maintains that the principle of unanimity must be followed in the following circumstances: amending the treaty and its appendices, adopting amendments to the treaty, accusing countries of violating the treaty, voting on substantive issues related to supervision and inspection, etc. When making this proposal, Tsarapkin said that the principle of unanimity would strengthen cooperation between countries participating in the treaty. This is the only viable basis for a treaty banning nuclear testing.

The Western representatives stubbornly insisted that the principle of unanimity "would invalidate supervision and violate the purpose of the treaty prohibiting testing."

However, people remember that the principle of unanimity, which the representatives of the United States and Britain rejected today, was recognized and proposed by the West during disarmament negotiations.

### 在不继续核试验会议上  西方国家又制造障碍

    在不继续核试验会议上
    西方国家又制造障碍
    新华社日内瓦5日电　5日下午日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议举行了一次短暂的会议。美英两国在会上悍然拒绝了苏联提出的关于监督委员会在就实质问题表决时采取一致同意的原则的建议。据悉，在会议讨论禁止核试验条约规定成立的监督委员会的表决办法时，西方代表们拒绝认真考虑苏联的建议。苏联代表查拉普金是在上星期应西方要求提出这个建议的。苏联主张，在下列情况必须遵循各国一致的原则；修改条约和条约附录，通过条约的修正案，指责违反条约的国家，表决有关监督和视察的实质问题等等。查拉普金在提出这个建议时说，一致原则将加强参加条约的国家之间的合作。这是禁止核试验条约的唯一可行的基础。
    西方代表硬说一致原则“将使监督无效和违反禁止试验条约的目的”。
    但是人们记得，今天遭到美国和英国代表拒绝的一致原则是西方在裁军谈判期间承认和建议采取的。
