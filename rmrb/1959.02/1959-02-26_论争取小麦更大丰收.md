On Striving for a Greater Wheat Harvest
Liu Ruilong

The area sown with summer harvest grain crops this year accounts for more than one-quarter of the total area sown with grain crops for the whole year, and the wheat area accounts for more than 80% of the summer harvest grain crops. Striving for a bumper harvest of wheat and other summer harvest crops is the first great battle on this year's agricultural production front. Winning this battle not only accounts for a large proportion of the completion of the year's total grain production task; but also, due to the bumper wheat harvest, it will surely greatly boost morale, inspire enthusiasm, and promote even greater harvests of autumn crops, thereby overfulfilling the year's agricultural production increase targets.

Great Hope for a Bumper Wheat Harvest

This year the quality of wheat sowing is good, and the wheat seedlings are growing exceptionally strong. As long as we continue to strengthen management, overcome disasters, and increase yields by one, two, or even several times on the basis of last year, it is all possible. There is great hope for a greater wheat harvest this year. This is because:

First, the foundation for wheat is well laid, and its congenital conditions are sufficient. In the wheat sowing season last year, the high tide of people's communalization had already arrived, and the sowing quality was much better than in previous years. Basic yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density were better implemented than in any other year, surpassing not only last year's bumper wheat but also other crops that achieved high yields in the autumn last year. This is mainly reflected in: (1) Good base moisture. Before sowing last year, most areas had soaking rain, and 200 million mu of wheat fields could be irrigated. Many wheat fields were realized as ridge fields. (2) Deep plowing. According to statistics from ten provinces and cities, wheat fields with deep plowing of more than one chi account for about two-thirds of the total wheat field area. (3) Abundant base fertilizer. About 90% of the wheat fields have been applied with base fertilizer. Those applying 20,000 jin or more of base fertilizer per mu each account for one-third. (4) Dense sowing. An average of about 30 jin per mu. (5) Good seeds. Improved varieties account for about 90% of the total wheat field area.

Second, wheat field management was grasped early and well. Party secretaries in many regions personally took charge and launched a large-scale wheat field management campaign. In provinces such as Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, more than 20 million people were involved in the wheat field management campaign, and more than 500,000 wheat field management teams were organized. Many regions also carried out wheat field management work appraisals and inspections, established high-yield demonstration plots, and launched a large-scale high-yield campaign. According to statistics from ten provinces and cities, the area of wheat fields topdressed with fertilizer reached more than 80%, with an average of about 10,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu, and those with more than two topdressings accounted for 40%. The area of winter irrigation has doubled compared with last year. In the north, irrigated wheat fields account for 36% of the total wheat fields, and spring irrigation is being actively advanced.

Third, the wheat growth situation is better than in any previous year. According to estimates from reports from various provinces and cities, there are an average of about 500,000 plants per mu. Ranking of ten provinces and cities: Class I wheat fields account for about 57%, with an average of two to three tillers per seedling and 500,000 to 800,000 plants per mu, with full and strong seedlings; Class II wheat fields account for about 34.2%, with an average of one to two tillers per seedling and 300,000 to 500,000 plants per mu; Class III wheat fields account for 8.8%, with few tillers and generally less than 300,000 plants per mu, with weaker growth. These are mainly late-sown wheat fields where stubble was cleared late, plowing was shallow, less fertilizer was applied or no fertilizer was applied, sowing quality was rough, and management work was not followed up in time.

This year's wheat has sufficient congenital conditions, and postnatal management has been grasped early and tightly. The wheat seedlings are generally growing well, and the foundation for a greater harvest has already been laid. According to the current growth of wheat seedlings, it is estimated that there are an average of about 500,000 plants per mu. If they are well cultivated, it is possible to maintain 500,000 ears per mu. An average of 30 grains per ear can guarantee a yield of 1,000 jin; if each ear can have 45 grains, it can guarantee a yield of 1,500 jin. We must see this condition, muster our efforts, and strive to achieve high-yield targets. However, the hope for a bumper wheat harvest does not mean that the bumper harvest has already been decided, and the wheat has already been obtained. There are still more than eighty days from now until the wheat harvest. We must pass through a tense battle period.

Still Several Hurdles to Overcome

Wheat yield is composed of the number of plants, the number of ears, the number of grains, and the weight of the grains. The basic key to ensuring a greater wheat harvest is to follow the laws of wheat growth and development and overcome the stages of returning to green, jointing, heading, flowering, grain filling, and harvesting. Throughout the entire growth stage of wheat, we must take care of it like a mother nurturing an infant, feeding it when it is hungry and watering it when it is thirsty, in order to achieve high yields.

The overwintering tillering stage has basically passed in most areas. In this stage, the wheat overwintering situation is good in areas where attention has been paid to timely topdressing, winter irrigation, and strengthening management.

After the "Awakening of Insects," wheat begins to return to green in most areas. The most important issue is to overcome the wheat returning to green and rising stage. This is the main period for the formation of wheat ears, the elongation of ear primordia, and the differentiation of spikelets and florets, which not only determines the number of wheat ears but also basically prepares the prototype for the size of the ears. In this stage, ensuring that wheat seedlings have abundant nutrients can consolidate pre-winter tillering, increase early spring tillering, improve the effective tillering rate, and increase the number of ears; abundant nutrients can also appropriately extend the differentiation time of spikelets and increase the number of spikelets, achieving long and large ears.

After returning to green, it enters the jointing and heading stage. During this period, the wheat ears have basically been finalized, and it is an important stage to determine how many grains each ear will set and to prevent lodging and frost damage. The main task of field management at this time is to ensure the healthy development of stems and improve the setting rate of spikelets. Therefore, on the basis of topdressing in the returning to green stage, it is also necessary to appropriately topdress in the jointing stage to catch up with the needs of booting and flowering, reduce the number of sterile spikelets and florets, and achieve large ears and many grains. For some weaker wheat plants, apply quick-acting "partial fertilizer," in addition to nitrogen fertilizer, and also pay attention to increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to promote strong stems. When wheat reaches the jointing stage, the stems elongate rapidly, requiring a large amount of water (accounting for more than a quarter of the total water requirement during the entire growth period); if there is a lack of water, it will make the wheat plants short, with small ears and few grains. However, on the basis of watering the returning to green water early, the jointing water should be watered appropriately later to make the base internodes of the stems short, thick, and tough, enhancing lodging resistance.

Flowering and grain filling are the stages that determine the fullness and weight of wheat grains. After wheat flowers and is fertilized, the number of grains per ear has been finalized, and the nutrients accumulated in the wheat stems and leaves are continuously transported to the grains. When wheat is filling grain, the supply of water is very important; if there is insufficient water, the grains will not be full. It is necessary to water the flowering, grain filling, and grain promoting three times early, promoting sufficient grain filling and full grains. At this time, some quick-acting fertilizers (especially phosphate fertilizer) should also be applied to continuously supply nutrients so that the grains continue to grow.

The final determinant of a bumper harvest is the ripening and harvesting stage. Wheat in the main winter wheat producing areas of China generally ripens successively from late May to early June. The ripening period of wheat is short and concentrated. "When wheat ripens, seize the time from the dragon's mouth," and time is very tight. Every year, the wheat harvesting season is prone to rain damage. All preparations must be made in advance to ensure timely harvesting, threshing, turning, and storage. Ensure that not a single ear is left in the field and not a single grain is lost on the threshing ground. Losses will be suffered if harvesting is too late or harvesting is rough.

To overcome the above stages, there must be practical measures to guarantee:

First, strengthen management and cultivation to ensure that wheat has sufficient fertilizer and water, achieving five increases (plants, ears, grains, weight, yield). After deep plowing and dense planting, the demand for fertilizer and water for wheat has greatly increased. Fertilizer and water must keep up to prevent any dehydration or fertilizer deficiency. The amount of water and fertilizer required for each stage of wheat returning to green, jointing, heading, flowering, and grain filling must be specifically calculated, plans must be made, and preparations must be made in advance to facilitate timely fertilization and irrigation. At present, while accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, we must also pay attention to improving the quality of fertilizer, and transport and apply it as it is accumulated. In terms of fertilization methods, base fertilizer is generally more important than topdressing, and the early stage is more important than the later stage; but this does not mean that topdressing is no longer needed if there is enough base fertilizer. Especially in the case of high yields, it is necessary to continuously supply the wheat growth with the necessary nutrients and water. In terms of irrigation, it is necessary to repair canal banks and ridge fields, supplement water lifting equipment, ensure timely irrigation, and do a good job in irrigation management. Whether fertilizing or irrigating, it must be done in a timely and appropriate amount according to the situation. In addition, timely weeding and hoeing should also be carried out.

Second, strengthen the fight against natural disasters and do a good job in five prevention tasks:

(1) Prevent drought and waterlogging. Although the base moisture is good at present, attention should be paid to possible climate changes from February to April. According to the Central Meteorological Bureau, rainfall in North China and Huaihe River Basin in March will be 25% less than normal, and 25%-50% less in April. All localities should make full use of existing water sources to strengthen irrigation. Areas without water sources should do a good job in conserving soil moisture. In the south, ditches should be cleared and drained to prevent spring rain from becoming waterlogging.

(2) Prevent diseases and insect pests. The temperature is higher in winter, and the planting is denser, which is suitable for the reproduction of rust spores. According to reports from ten provinces and cities, rust has been found in ninety-nine counties and cities. If it is not prevented and controlled in time, it may occur severely in the later stages. The south is rainy, and we must prevent the occurrence of scab. Fewer pests died during the winter, which is worth noting. We must now do a good job in forecasting and early warning work, prepare medicines and machinery as much as possible, and start early to eliminate diseases and insect pests in the early stages, so as not to spread.

(3) Prevent frost damage. The end date of late frost may be extended this year. The weather is warmer now, and it may turn cold in some places. Strengthen weather forecasts and prepare for frost prevention.

(4) Prevent lodging. The main measure is to apply fertilizer and irrigate rationally during the jointing and booting stages to make the wheat plants grow healthily and prevent early lodging.

(5) Prevent wind and rain. The methods are to water in advance, harvest in time, and prevent rain damage.

Third, harvest in time to achieve a bumper harvest, with every grain stored in the granary. Prepare labor, tools, threshing grounds, warehouses, etc. in accordance with the wheat bumper harvest plan, and make plans. At all levels of provinces, prefectures, counties, and communes, organize special personnel to prepare harvesting, threshing, and transportation tools before the wheat harvest to ensure timely harvesting, threshing, turning, and storage. Before harvesting, select seeds by ear and store them separately.

Bumper Yield Fields Drive Overall Bumper Yields

A common feature in the struggle for greater wheat harvests in various places is to focus on managing large-area high-yield fields to drive general fields, continuously eliminate Class III seedlings, and promote overall bumper yields. The ten key wheat-producing provinces and cities in China have tens of millions of mu of high-yield fields, which are the bases for promoting the current overall leap forward in agricultural production, and also preparing conditions for the great ideal of high yield, less planting, more harvesting, and building a modern agricultural landscape. The yield per mu of these high-yield fields (also called high-yield squares) must be more than twice the average yield per mu of local general fields, and this requirement can be achieved, according to the high-yield records in many places in 1958.

In order to truly obtain high yields in high-yield fields, it is necessary to cultivate high-yield fields in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, and systematically construct them in a planned way. High-yield fields should be scientifically and meticulously managed, and a field management archive system should be established; and on the basis of summarizing experience, technical operating procedures for various crops should be formulated, and a sound responsibility system should be established. Efforts should be made to improve labor productivity. With the progress of tool reform, mechanization, and fine fertilization, management quotas should be gradually increased. There should be strict requirements for the basic construction and planting and cultivation of high-yield fields, and standardization should be gradually achieved. Of course, this standardization is required by crop production, and is neither forced orders nor rigid and unchanging, but to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, use the power, wisdom and experience of the masses to enrich and develop these procedures, and continuously improve them.

Attention should be paid to fully grasping and fully utilizing the experience of high-yield fields to promote general fields, so as to achieve overall bumper yields, which is the fundamental purpose of operating high-yield fields. If we only pay attention to grasping high-yield fields and lose sight of general fields, this will inevitably seriously affect the increase in total output, which is extremely detrimental to striving for overall bumper yields.

In order to strengthen the leadership of high-yield fields, various places have established experimental fields (some are called command fields, satellite fields). All those that can be promoted or are preparing to be promoted in large-area high-yield fields should be tested in experimental fields, systematically observed, detailed records should be made, and small conclusions should be made in stages in time with the crop growth process, and scientific summaries of the entire process should be made after the crop is harvested.

Whether in high-yield fields, general fields, or experimental fields, there are Class III fields and Class III seedlings. "Every square has Class III fields, and every block has Class III seedlings," which refers to those plots where crops are growing temporarily poorly and plants that are growing poorly. This requires strengthening management and carrying out a land and seedling upgrading movement, so that Class III plots become Class I plots, and Class III wheat seedlings become Class I wheat seedlings. This is a continuous movement. After Class III seedlings are eliminated once, new Class III seedlings will appear on a higher level. This requires us to adopt the spirit of continuous revolution, strengthen management and cultivation, strive for balanced development, and continuously break through the balance, continuously expand the high-yield position, and achieve overall bumper yields.

Do Everything Possible to Utilize Favorable Factors

A summer harvest is promising, but we still have to overcome five stages. To strive for a greater wheat harvest, we must continue to strengthen political and ideological work, not only continuously overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, but also continuously fighting against complacency and paralysis. By overcoming these two kinds of thinking, overcoming the five stages in practical work, and overcoming disasters, it is entirely possible to obtain a harvest that is one, two, or even greater times higher than last year this summer. When the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward is generally carried out, right-leaning conservative thinking often appears in those cultivated land with Class III seedlings, areas with poor conditions, when natural disasters strike seriously, and in places where skeptics are in charge of leadership. In these places and at these times, we must fight them with the actual facts of crop growth and educate and persuade them with facts. After overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, the most likely and most dangerous tendency to occur after the upsurge of mass production is complacency and paralysis. This tendency may cause serious losses. In the struggle to strive for a greater wheat harvest, the favorable factors that promote the wheat harvest and the unfavorable factors that cause the wheat yield to decrease exist at the same time. These two factors bring two possibilities to wheat production: complacency, paralysis, and negligence will inevitably lead to a decrease in yield per mu; working diligently and doing everything possible will increase yield per mu. We must be "accounting factions" who strive for a bumper wheat harvest, specifically calculate the factors that are beneficial or unfavorable to increasing production according to the situation of each growth and development stage of the crop, grasp and fully utilize the favorable factors, and overcome the unfavorable factors at any time, so that we can obtain high yields.

Striving for a greater wheat harvest is the first large-scale battle on this year's agricultural front. Each stage is a battle, so we must organize battles in a planned way according to the crop growth season, and develop forward wave after wave. The common task of each battle is to give the crops sufficient nutrition and water, and overcome all disasters and difficulties that the crops may encounter during the growth process. The early stage management should be done well, and the later stage management requires higher standards, with more effort and more perfection. At every key period of crop growth and development, letting things go is failure; strengthening leadership, grasping key issues, and solving them in time can achieve victory. The peasants say: "A tight grip and a slack grip make a difference of half," which is the reason.

The central work of strengthening field management now is to establish a sound responsibility system for high-yield fields, experimental fields, and general fields. The method of dividing squares and areas, dividing blocks and mu, fixing squares, and contracting to the end, proposed by Shandong Province. The method of having marshals in every road, generals in every square, soldiers in every area, everyone is responsible, no blocks are missed, and every mu has a bumper yield, proposed by Henan Province. The methods of team contracting squares, group contracting areas, and people contracting ridges, etc., proposed by Hebei Province, are all good forms that combine large-scale mass movements with a detailed field management responsibility system.

Wheat growth cannot stop for a moment, and management work is competing for every second. To achieve this goal, we must make preparations in advance in terms of ideology, materials, and measures. Economic work is becoming more and more detailed, and agricultural work is no exception. Production practice has put forward many new economic, scientific, and technological problems, requiring us to study deeply, analyze meticulously, propose measures in time, start work, see the next step in the previous step, step by step, without loosening one link, and taking care of them carefully until the wheat harvest enters the warehouse, which is when we achieve the final victory.

    论争取小麦更大丰收
    刘瑞龙
    今年夏收粮食作物面积占全年粮食作物播种面积四分之一以上，小麦面积又占夏收粮食作物80％以上。争取小麦等夏收作物丰收，是今年农业生产战线上第一个伟大的战役。这一仗打胜了，不仅在完成今年全年粮食生产上占有很大的比重；而且由于小麦的丰收，必然会大大振奋人心，鼓舞士气，推动秋季作物获得更大丰收，从而超额完成全年的农业增产任务。
    小麦丰收大有希望
    今年小麦播种质量好，麦苗生长空前茁壮，只要继续加强管理，战胜灾害，使产量在去年的基础上提高一倍、两倍甚至几倍，都是可能的。今年小麦的更大丰收，是大有希望的。这是因为：
    第一、小麦底子打得好，先天足。去年小麦播种季节，人民公社化高潮业已到来，播种质量比往年好得多。水、肥、土、种、密等项基本增产措施，比任何一年都作得好，不仅超过去年丰收的小麦，也超过去年秋季获得高产的其他作物。主要表现在：（一）底墒好。去年播种前大部分地区都降了透雨，两亿亩麦田可以进行灌溉，不少麦田实现了畦田化。（二）耕翻深。据十省市统计，深翻一尺以上的麦田约占麦田总面积的三分之二。（三）底肥多。90％左右的麦田施了底肥。每亩施底肥二万斤和二万斤以上的各占三分之一。（四）播得密。平均每亩三十斤左右。（五）种子好。良种面积达麦田总面积90％左右。
    第二、麦田管理抓得早，抓得好。很多地区党委书记亲自挂帅，开展了大规模的麦田管理运动。河北、河南、山东等省投入麦田管理运动的人数在两千万以上，组织了麦田管理队伍五十多万个。许多地区还开展了小麦田间管理工作评比检查，建立了丰产方，开展了大面积高额丰产运动。据十省市统计，麦田追肥面积达80％以上，一般每亩追肥在一万斤左右，两次以上的占40％。冬灌面积比去年扩大了一倍，北方已浇麦田占总麦田36％，目前正在积极提早春灌。
    第三、小麦生长情况比以往任何一年都好。按各省市报告估算，平均每亩五十万株左右。十省市排队：一类麦田占57％左右，一般每苗有二到三个分蘖，每亩有五十到八十万株，苗全苗壮；二类麦田约占34.2％，一般每苗有一到二个分蘖，每亩三十到五十万株；三类麦田占8.8％，很少分蘖，一般每亩在三十万株以下，生长较弱。主要是一些腾茬较晚的晚播麦田，耕的浅，施肥少或者未施肥，播种质量粗糙，管理工作也没有及时跟上。
    今年小麦先天足，后天又抓得早，抓得紧，麦苗生长普遍良好，更大丰收的基础已经有了。按现在麦苗生长情况来算账，每亩平均已有五十万株左右，培育得好，每亩保持五十万穗是可能的。按每穗三十粒就能保证千斤的产量；如果每穗能有四十五粒，就能保证一千五百斤的产量。我们必须看到这个条件，鼓足干劲，力争实现高产量的指标。但是，小麦丰收有望，不等于丰收业已定局，麦子已经到手。现在到收麦还有八十多天，要渡过一整段紧张的战斗时期。
  　还要过好几关
    小麦产量是由株数、穗数、粒数、粒重构成的。确保小麦更大丰收的基本关键，就是按照小麦生长发育的规律，过好返青、拔节、抽穗、扬花、灌浆、收获等关。在小麦整个生长阶段，都要像母亲抚育婴儿一样，饥了就喂，渴了就饮，精心护理，才能达到高额丰产。
    越冬分蘖关，在大部分地区已经基本过去了。在这个阶段，凡是注意及时追肥、冬灌、加强管理的，小麦越冬情况都好。
    “惊蛰”以后，大部地区小麦开始返青。最主要的问题是过好小麦返青起身关。这是麦穗形成的主要时期，是穗胎伸长，小穗、小花的分化期，不仅决定麦穗的多少，也基本上为穗子的大小准备了雏型。在这个阶段，保证麦苗有丰富的营养料，就可以巩固冬前分蘖，增多早春分蘖，提高有效分蘖率，增多穗数；丰富的营养料，还可以适当延长小穗的分化时间，增加小穗数，达到穗长穗大。
    返青以后，进入拔节、抽穗时期。在这时期，麦穗已经基本定型，到了决定每个穗子结实多少并且是预防倒伏、预防霜冻的重要阶段。这时田间管理的主要任务是保证茎秆健全发育，提高小穗的结实率。因此在返青期追肥的基础上，还要适当在拔节期追肥，以赶上孕穗开花的需要，减少不孕小穗小花数，达到穗大粒多。对一些生长较弱的麦株，要追施速效性“偏肥”除施氮肥外，并且要注意增施磷、钾质肥料，促使茎秆粗壮。小麦到拔节期，茎秆迅速伸长，需要大量水分（约占全生长期的需水量的四分之一还多）；如果缺水，就会使麦株矮小，穗小粒少。但是在早浇返青水的基础上，拔节水要适当迟浇，使茎秆基部节间粗短坚韧，增强抗倒伏的能力。
    扬花、灌浆，是决定小麦粒饱、粒重的阶段。当小麦扬花受精以后，每穗的粒数已经定型，小麦茎叶中积累的养分不断向籽粒中输送。在小麦灌浆时，供应水分十分重要；水分不足，结籽就不能饱满。要根据气候、土壤及小麦生长需要，先期浇好扬花、灌浆、催籽三道水，促使灌浆充足，结实饱满。这时还要加施些速效性的肥料（特别是磷肥），不断供应养分，使籽粒不断壮大。
    最后决定丰产丰收的，是成熟收获阶段。我国冬麦主要产区小麦一般在5月下旬6月上旬先后成熟。小麦的成熟期短而集中，“麦熟一晌，龙口夺食”，时间十分紧迫。每年收麦季节容易遭受雨害。要事先做好一切准备，保证及时收割、脱粒、翻晒、入仓。做到地里一穗不留，场上一粒不丢。收获过晚或收获粗糙，都会遭受损失。
    要过好以上各个关口，就要有实际措施加以保证：
    第一，要加强管理培育，保证小麦要肥有肥，要水有水，做到五增（株、穗、粒、重、产）。在深耕、密植以后，小麦对于肥、水的需要大大增加了，必须使水、肥跟上去，防止任何脱水、脱肥的现象发生。对于小麦返青、拔节、抽穗、扬花、灌浆等各个阶段的水、肥需要量，都要具体算账，订出计划，事先准备，以便及时进行施肥、灌溉。目前在大量积肥的同时，还要注意提高肥料的质量，要随积随运，随运随施。在施肥方法上，一般是底肥重于追肥，前期重于后期；但并不是说底肥足就不再需要追肥了。尤其在要求高产的情况下，必须源源不断地供给小麦生长以必需的养料和水分。在灌水方面，要修好渠埂、畦田，增补提水用具，保证及时灌溉，并且作好灌溉管理工作。不论施肥和灌水，都要根据情况作到适时适量。此外，还要及时进行中耕除草等工作。
    第二，要加强与自然灾害作斗争，作好五防工作：
    （一）防旱涝。目前底墒虽好，但要注意2月到4月间可能发生的气候变化。根据中央气象局材料，3月份华北、淮北降雨量比常年要少25％，4月份少25％—50％。各地要尽量利用现有水源，加强灌溉。没有水源的地区，要作好保墒工作。南方要清沟排水，防止春雨成涝。
    （二）防病虫。冬季气温较高，种的较密，适于锈病孢子的繁殖。据十个省、市的报告，已有九十九个县市发现锈病。如不及时防治，后期可能严重发生。南方多雨，要预防赤霉病的发生。害虫越冬死亡的较少，值得注意。现在就要作好预测预报工作，尽一切可能准备好药械，及早动手，消灭病虫在点片和幼龄阶段，不使蔓延。
    （三）防霜冻。今年晚霜终止日期可能延长。现在天气较暖，有些地方也可能转冷。加强气象预报，作好防霜准备。
      （四）防倒伏。主要是在拔节孕穗阶段，合理施肥、灌溉，使麦株生长健壮，防止前期倒伏。
    （五）防风雨。办法是事先浇水，及时收获，防止雨害。
    第三，要及时收获，做到丰产丰收，颗粒归仓。按照小麦丰产计划准备劳力、工具、晒场、仓库等，做好规划。省、专、县、社各级组织专人在小麦收获前准备好收割、脱粒、运输工具，保证及时收割、脱粒、翻晒、入仓。收割前要穗选种子，单打单藏。
    丰产田带动全面丰产
    在各地争取小麦更大丰收的斗争中一个共同特点，就是抓紧经营大面积高额丰产田，带动一般田，不断地消灭三类苗，推动全面丰产。我国小麦重要产区十个省市有几千万亩丰产田，这是推动当前农业生产全面跃进的基地，也是为高产、少种、多收和建设现代化农业逐步实现大地园林化的伟大理想准备条件的。这些丰产田（又叫丰产方）的亩产量，必须高过当地一般田的平均亩产量的一倍以上，这个要求是可能实现的，1958年不少地方的丰产纪录，就是根据。
    为了使丰产方真正获得高额产量，就要按照农业增产“八字宪法”的要求，培养丰产方，有计划地系统地进行建设。对丰产方应当科学地精细管理，建立田间管理的档案制度；并且应在总结经验的基础上，制定各种作物的技术操作规程，建立健全的责任制。要努力提高劳动生产率，随着工具改革的机械化、细肥化的进展，逐步提高管理定额。对丰产方的基本建设和种植栽培，要有严格的要求，逐步做到规格化。当然，这种规格化，是作物生产所要求的，既不是强迫命令，更不是僵硬不前，而是要发挥群众的积极性创造性，运用群众的力量、智慧和经验，充实和发展这些规程，使它不断完善。
    要注意全面掌握，充分运用丰产田的经验推动一般田，达到全面丰产，这正是经营丰产田的根本目的。如果只注意抓丰产田而丢掉一般田，这就必然要严重地影响到总产量的增加，对争取全面丰产是极其不利的。
    为了加强对丰产田的领导，各地都建立了试验田（有的名为指挥田、卫星田）。凡是能在大面积丰产田上推广或准备推广的，都要在试验田进行试验，系统观察，详细纪录，随着作物生长过程及时做出阶段小结，在作物收获后做出全部过程的科学总结。
    不论在丰产田、一般田、试验田上，都有三类田、三类苗。“方方都有三类田，块块都有三类苗”，这是指那些庄稼生长暂时比较差些的地块和长得差些的植株说的。这就要通过加强管理，进行地块禾苗升级运动，使三类地块变成一类地块，三类麦苗变成一类麦苗。这是一个不间断的运动，消灭了一次三类苗，又会在高一级的基础上出现新的三类苗。这就要求我们采取不断革命的精神，加强管理培育，既要争取平衡发展，又要不断突破平衡，不断扩大丰产阵地，达到全面丰产。
    千方百计发挥有利因素
    夏季丰收有望，还要过好五关。要力争小麦更大丰收，就要继续加强政治思想工作，既要不断地克服右倾保守思想，又要不断地和自满麻痹思想作斗争。战胜了这两种思想，在实际工作中过好五关，战胜灾害，今年夏季就完全有可能获得比去年高出一倍、两倍甚至更大的丰收。在大跃进的群众运动普遍开展的时候，右倾保守思想常常出现在那些三类苗的耕地上、条件较差的地区、自然灾害袭击严重的时候和那些本来就是怀疑派担负领导的地方。在这些地方和在这些时候，必须随时以作物生长的实际事实和他们斗争，拿出事实教育他们、说服他们。克服了右倾保守思想，群众性的生产高潮起来之后，最容易发生也是危险最大的是自满麻痹倾向。这种倾向可能造成严重的损失。在争取小麦更大丰收的斗争中，促进小麦丰收的有利因素和造成小麦减产的不利因素是同时存在的，这两种因素给小麦生产带来了两种可能性：自满麻痹、疏忽大意，必然造成降低亩产量；兢兢业业尽力而为，才能提高亩产量。我们要做争取小麦丰收的“算账派”，按照作物各个生长发育阶段的情况，根据实际数据，具体计算对增产有利或是不利的因素，紧紧抓住并且充分利用有利因素，随时克服不利因素，我们就能获得高额产量。
    争取小麦更大丰收，是今年农业战线上第一个规模巨大的战役，每过一道关，就是一次战斗，因此必须按照作物生长季节有计划地组织战斗，一个高潮接着一个高潮地向前发展。每个战斗的共同任务，都是要给作物充分的营养和水分，克服作物生长过程中可能遭到的一切灾害和困难。前期管理要搞好，后期管理要求更高，要劲上加劲，精益求精。在作物生长发育的每一个关键时期，放任自流就是失败；加强领导，抓紧关键问题及时解决，才能获得胜利。农民说：“一紧一松差一半”，就是这个道理。
    现在加强田间管理的中心工作是不论丰产田、试验田、一般田，都要建立健全的责任制。山东省所提的划方分片，分块分亩，固定包方，一包到底。河南省所提路路有帅、方方有将、片片有兵、人人有责、块块不漏、亩亩丰产。河北省所提队包方、组包片、人包畦等方法，都是把大规模的群众运动和细致的田间管理责任制结合起来的好形式。
    小麦生长一刻不能停止，管理工作分秒必争。要达到这个目的，必须事前在思想上、物质上和措施上做好准备。经济工作愈做愈细，农业工作不能例外。生产实践中提出了很多经济上的科学技术上的新问题，要求我们深入研究，细致分析，及时提出措施，展开工作，前一步就看到下一步，一步跟一步，一环不松，一着不让，精心护理，直到小麦收获入仓，才是我们取得最后胜利的时候。
