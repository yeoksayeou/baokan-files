    Sichuan and Henan Rush to Produce Spring Plowing Farm Tools
    Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang, Combines Preparation for Farming with Vigorous Tool Reform
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th: More than 10,000 farm tool manufacturing plants in Sichuan Province are stepping up the production of improved farm tools urgently needed for spring plowing, such as deep plowing, sowing, water lifting, rice transplanting, pest control, and transportation. Five hundred thousand rope-drawn plows and one million improved deep plows have been shipped one after another for spring deep plowing in various places; in addition, one million simple rice transplanters and a large number of seeders, seedling field leveling and furrowing machines, and other major spring plowing farm tools are also being rushed into production.
    The tool reform movement centered on spring sowing tools in various places is being carried out in accordance with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, which further requires intensive and meticulous farming, and adapting to local conditions. In order to carry out deep plowing of paddy fields early and overcome the difficulty of cold weather preventing cattle from entering the paddy fields, Mianyang, Nanchong, Luzhou and other prefectures have manufactured various types of rope-drawn plows for winter paddy fields. This plow has four plowing blades and only requires one person to operate, without needing to enter the water at all. The wooden boat-drawn plow manufactured in Santai County can plow to a depth of 1.5 feet and can plow twelve mu per day, increasing work efficiency by seven times compared to plowing cattle. The wooden grain sowing machine created in Yilong and other counties is also more uniform than sowing by hand, increasing efficiency by 20 times. In the vast hilly and mountainous areas, farmers have created a large number of improved water lifting tools to solve the problem of water lifting and water storage in paddy fields in a timely manner. Yingshan, Peng'an, Nanbu and other counties have manufactured a large number of wooden soil water pumps, which can lift 1.5 cubic meters of water per minute to a height of more than three zhang, and can also drive generators to generate electricity. Old-fashioned dragon bone waterwheels in various counties in Nanchong Prefecture have been universally installed with ball bearings, which can save one or two people and increase work efficiency several times. Many places have created various types of topdressing tools based on the "eat less, more meals" topdressing method adopted this year. In addition, various types of sowing machines have also been created in corn, cotton, and sweet potato producing areas.
    In the tool reform, all localities have launched a mass movement, mobilizing everyone to participate. All localities have successively trained a large number of new farm tool experts.
    Our newspaper Zhengzhou 20th: Henan is preparing spring plowing and wheat field farm implements across the region in order to welcome the agricultural great leap forward of this year. Starting from December last year, commercial departments in various regions dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to assist various communes in conducting typical investigations, formulating farm implement production plans, and signing processing contracts with industrial departments or purchasing from other places for spring plowing and wheat field farm implements that are currently unable to be produced or are insufficiently produced by the communes. The Henan Provincial Planning Committee has recently allocated 80 to 100 tons of pig iron to each county. Party organizations in various regions are drawing a certain proportion of labor to invest in farm tool manufacturing and repair work.
    In terms of new farm implement repair, distribution, and supply, Nanyang Prefecture recently conducted a comprehensive census of new farm implements, and is rushing to produce farm implement parts and power machinery parts. Deng County dispatched more than 30 technicians to carry parts to various townships, inspecting and repairing farm implements at the same time. Luoyang Prefecture cleared its inventory and distributed more than 36,000 existing step plows, double-share plows and some parts to the grassroots supply points.
    In order to cooperate and support each other, some prefectures and prefectures, counties and counties, communes and communes, mountainous areas and plains have begun to be linked to balance shortages. (Liu Chuanxun)
    According to the Xinjiang Daily, many areas in Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang, have combined tool reform with preparatory farming work centered on manure accumulation, greatly improving labor efficiency and accelerating the progress of manure accumulation and water conservancy repair.
    Some communes in Shule County put forward the slogan of "realizing vehicle-ization" in manure accumulation, using vehicles to replace carrying poles and bags to transport fertilizer. One team of the third brigade of the Chengqu People's Commune in the county built more than 240 handcarts and remodeled 180 pole-drawn carts, with an average of one cart for every three laborers. Some communes in Bachu County changed the way of using donkeys to carry manure in bags to using live-bottom willow baskets to carry manure, which increased the efficiency of donkeys transporting manure by one to two times. More than 1,000 large carts with installed ball bearings in the communes of Shufu County greatly improved work efficiency.
    On the construction site of the large canals on the east and west banks of the Yarkand River in Shache, Zepu, and other counties, tens of thousands of digging and transportation tools were modified, using pushcarts instead of human carrying and shoulder carrying, and cross picks instead of Kantuman. In the water conservancy construction sites of various communes in Bachu County, wheelbarrows and baskets were universally promoted, which made the work efficiency doubled. Hongqi and Dongfanghong communes in Kashgar City boldly successfully trial-produced high-altitude earth transport cable cars, accelerating the construction progress.

### 四川河南赶制春耕农具  新疆喀什专区结合备耕大搞工具改革

    四川河南赶制春耕农具
    新疆喀什专区结合备耕大搞工具改革
    据新华社成都19日电　四川省各地一万多个农具制造厂，正在加紧赶制深耕、播种、提水、插秧、治虫、运输等春耕生产急需的改良农具。有五十万部绳索牵引犁和一百万部改良深耕犁已陆续出厂，供各地春季深翻使用；另有一百万部简易水稻插秧机和大批播种器、秧田平整开厢器等主要春耕生产农具，也正在赶制中。
    各地以春播工具为中心的工具改革运动，是根据农业生产大跃进进一步要求精耕细作的新情况，因地制宜地开展起来的。为了提早进行稻田深翻，克服天冷耕牛无法下水田的困难，绵阳、南充、泸州等专区都制造出了各式冬水田绳索牵引犁。这种犁有四个犁头，只需一人操作，完全不需下水。三台县制造的木船牵引犁深翻一尺五寸，一天可耕十二亩，工效比耕牛提高七倍。仪陇等县创造的木质撒谷机，也比用手撒得均匀，效率提高二十倍。在广大丘陵和山地，农民们创造了大量改良提水工具，及时解决水稻田的提水蓄水问题。营山、蓬安、南部等县制造出大量木质土水泵，每分钟能提水一点五公方，高度可达三丈多，还可以带动发电机发电。南充专区各县的旧式龙骨水车普遍安装上滚珠轴承，既可节省一、二个人力，又可提高工效数倍。许多地方根据今年采用“少吃多餐”的追肥方法，创造出了各式各样的追肥工具。另外，在玉米、棉花、红苕等作物产区，也都创制出了各种类型的播种器械。
    各地在工具改革中都大搞群众运动，发动人人动手。各地都相继训练了大批新式农具手。
    本报郑州20日讯　河南各地普遍准备春耕和麦田农具，迎接今年的农业大丰收。各地商业部门从去年12月份起，派出大批干部深入农村协助各公社进行典型调查，订出农具生产规划，就各公社目前尚不能生产或生产不足的春耕和麦田农具，分别同工业部门签订加工合同或向外地采购。河南省计划委员会最近已向每个县拨出生铁八十至一百吨。各地党组织正抽出一定比例的劳力，投入农具制造、修理工作。
    在新式农具修配、供应方面，南阳专区最近进行了新式农具的全面普查，正在赶制农具零件、动力机械零件。邓县派出三十多名技术员携带零件到各乡，边检查，边修理农具。洛阳专区清查库存，把现存的三万六千多个步犁、双铧犁和一部分零件下放到各基层供应点。
    为了互相协作支援，部分专区与专区、县与县、公社与公社、山区和平原之间已经开始挂钩，平衡无缺。　（刘传勋）
    据新疆日报消息　新疆喀什专区不少地区把工具改革和以积肥为中心的备耕工作结合起来，大大提高劳动工效，加快了积肥、修水利进度。
    疏勒县一些公社在积肥中提出“实现车子化”的口号，用车子来代替抬把和口袋运肥。该县城区人民公社三大队的一个中队即造了手推车二百四十多辆，改制抬把推车一百八十多辆，平均每三个劳动力有一辆推车。巴楚县一些公社把毛驴用口袋驮粪改成了用活底柳筐驮粪，使毛驴运肥效率提高了一倍到两倍。疏附县公社安装滚珠轴承的大车有一千多辆，大大提高了工效。
    在水利建设上，莎车、泽普等县修建叶尔羌河东西两岸大渠工地，改制了数以万计的挖土运输工具，用推车代替了人背肩挑，十字镐代替了坎土镘。巴楚县各公社的水利工地，普遍推行了独轮车和挑筐，都使工效成倍提高。喀什市红旗、东方红公社大胆试制成功了高空运土滑车，加快了建设进度。
