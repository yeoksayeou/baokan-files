    Serve Production, Guarantee Health
    Jin Wen
    Gao Tang County in Shandong Province has established a medical and health care network centered on commune hospitals. It comprehensively carries out medical treatment and prevention, hygiene and epidemic prevention, maternal and child health care, and the elimination of the "Four Pests," which is convenient for the masses and has won universal praise. This is indeed a good thing. After the rural areas implemented people's communes, collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly were established, and the vast number of farmers shifted from a scattered life in the past to a collective life. With such a change in lifestyle, health work must keep up. From the perspective of improving people's lives, after the farmers no longer have to pay for food, the further requirement is health security. Gao Tang County has met the people's wishes, and the masses are therefore full of joy, happily singing "No worry about food and clothing, no fear of illness, the Communist Party is everywhere for the people!"
    Spring has arrived. This is the season when certain diseases are transmitted and prevalent, and it is also the time for intense spring plowing. It is conceivable that if we attach importance to health work after rural communization like Gao Tang County, and establish a medical and health care network centered on commune hospitals, when the epidemic season comes, we can prevent or control the spread of epidemics, and production can be unaffected or less affected. Now is a good time to strengthen medical and health care work. In places like Gao Tang County where commune health work has a preliminary foundation, we must seize the time to further improve the medical and health care network, continue to strengthen the medical and health care forces, step up epidemic prevention publicity, and do a good job in prevention. In places where health work is not given enough attention, it is necessary to strengthen medical and health care work as soon as possible like Gao Tang County. Spring plowing production is very tight, requiring every farmer to exert 24% of their effort. Therefore, leading cadres of counties and communes must take some time to do health work in the gaps of busy production. Because only when medical and health care work is done well and people are healthy can they be full of energy.
    In recent years, medical and health care work has developed greatly in various places, especially the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, which has laid an unprecedentedly favorable foundation for medical and health care work. At present, although conditions vary across the country, as long as we adapt to the time and place, grasp the main links of medical and health care work, such as strengthening the ideological education of health workers; conducting hygiene training for cooks and childcare workers; making reasonable arrangements for commune members, especially women and young people, in terms of labor time and intensity, this will have an extremely important role in preventing diseases and ensuring spring plowing production.

    服务生产　保证健康
    金文
    山东高唐县建立起以公社医院为中心的医疗保健网，把医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼保健、除四害等工作全面开展起来，群众称便，同声叫好。这确实是好事。农村实现人民公社化以后，公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业办起来了，广大农民群众由过去分散的生活转而为集体的生活。随着这样的生活方式的改变，卫生工作必需跟上去。从改善人民生活来说，农民群众在吃饭不要钱以后，进一步的要求就是健康的保障。高唐县满足了群众的这种愿望，群众因而满心欢喜，愉快地歌唱“吃穿不愁病不怕，共产党处处为人民”！
    春天已经到来了。这正是某些疾病传染、流行的季节，又正是紧张春耕的时候。可以设想，像高唐县这样重视农村公社化以后的卫生工作，建立起以公社医院为中心的医疗保健网，当疾病流行季节到来的时候，就可以制止或控制流行病的传播，可以使生产不受影响或少受影响。现在来加强医疗保健工作，正是好时候，像高唐县那样公社卫生工作已经有了初步基础的地方，要抓紧时间，把医疗保健网进一步健全起来，继续壮大医疗保健力量，加紧进行防疫宣传，做好预防工作。对卫生工作还重视不够的地方，有必要像高唐县那样，尽快加强医疗保健工作。春耕生产很紧，要求每一个农民都发挥二十四分的干劲。因此，县和公社的领导干部必须在忙着抓生产的间隙，抓一下卫生工作。因为只有做好医疗保健工作，人们身体健康，才能干劲冲天。
    医疗保健工作近年来各地都有了巨大发展，尤其是除害灭病运动，它为医疗保健工作奠定了空前有利的条件。目前全国各地虽然条件还各有不同，但是只要因时因地制宜，抓住医疗保健工作的主要环节，如加强卫生工作人员的思想教育；对炊事员、保育员进行卫生训练；对公社社员特别是妇女青年在劳动时间、劳动强度上作合理安排等，这对预防疾病，保证春耕生产会有极重要的作用。
