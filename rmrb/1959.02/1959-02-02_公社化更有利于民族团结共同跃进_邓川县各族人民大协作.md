Communization Is More Conducive to National Unity and Common Leap Forward: Cooperation Among People of All Ethnic Groups in Dengchuan County

(Our newspaper Kunming, 1st dispatch) Reporter Ye Zijian reports: After Dengchuan County in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province implemented people's communes, it further strengthened the national unity between the mountainous and plain areas within the county. All ethnic groups cooperate with each other and help each other, vigorously engage in tool reform, and vigorously engage in a manure accumulation campaign, thereby promoting a greater leap forward in production.

Dengchuan County has over 68,000 people from six ethnic groups including Han, Bai, Hui, Yi, Dai, and Tibetan, among which the Bai ethnic group is the largest, accounting for more than half of the population. The Han, Bai, and Hui ethnic groups mostly live in the plains. The Yi ethnic group mostly lives in the mountains. The ethnic groups living in the plains mainly grow rice and are good at raising dairy cows and fishing. Last year, the average rice yield per mu in the county reached more than 1,300 jin, ranking first in Yunnan Province. The ethnic groups in the mountains can grow dry land crops, and their potatoes and buckwheat have achieved high yields. They are also good at animal husbandry and operate large economic forests and orchards. However, the mountainous and plain areas each have their own shortcomings. The mountainous areas lack rice, vegetables, and rice straw for feeding livestock; the plain areas lack firewood and seeds for spring crops. In the past, some minor disputes inevitably occurred between ethnic groups due to mutual supply problems. In 1956, the entire county achieved advanced cooperativization, and thirty-four advanced cooperatives were established separately in the plains and mountainous areas, and these agricultural cooperatives made mutual adjustments, initially solving these problems. However, some problems could not be completely solved by the advanced cooperatives.

In order to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, in October last year, the Dengchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the demands of people of all ethnic groups, merged the thirty-four agricultural cooperatives and established two people's communes. Both communes have plains and mountainous areas. After the establishment of the communes, they were first faced with the two major tasks of autumn harvest and autumn planting, and a major battle for steel and copper, and the amount of labor and transportation increased several times compared with the same period in 1957. Under this circumstance, the Dengchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the commune party committees, based on the favorable conditions after communization, decided to unite the strength of all ethnic groups to uniformly arrange the resources of the mountainous and plain areas, and launched a mass movement to vigorously reform tools to save labor. The commune determined that the Yi ethnic group and some Bai ethnic group members in the mountainous areas would mainly engage in logging and digging potatoes, and do their best to meet the needs of the plain areas for manufacturing new agricultural tools and potato seeds. The Han, Bai, Hui and other ethnic group members in the plains were mainly responsible for the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and for the specific tool reforms. In this way, timber from the mountainous areas was continuously transported down the mountains, and blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers of all ethnic groups in the plains all went to the fields to study how to improve tools. In a very short period of time, the county produced more than 30,000 new agricultural tools and nearly 10,000 animal-powered vehicles and handcarts. Together with those built by the advanced cooperatives in the past, each laborer had an average of three new agricultural tools and one vehicle, and each production team had a set of horse-drawn or foot-operated threshing machines, grain screening machines, bellows, several animal-powered vehicles, and many handcarts. In the bountiful fields, it was rare to see people threshing, sifting, carrying, or winnowing grain. One grain screening machine replaced more than fifty people, and one bellows replaced more than thirty people winnowing. The commune members of all ethnic groups carried out the autumn harvest while deeply plowing the paddy fields, achieving rice harvesting and soil turning at the same time. At this time, the mountainous area also transferred more than one million jin of newly harvested potato seeds to the plain, and the plain also transferred more than one million jin of rice to the mountains. The commune members both in the mountains and at the foot of the mountains were very satisfied.

In order to strive for a greater harvest, the people of all ethnic groups in Dengchuan County have joined hands again and launched a vigorous manure accumulation upsurge. Not long ago, the commune members in the mountainous area sent a large amount of timber to the commune members in the plain, and they rushed to make nearly 10,000 rubber-wheeled and wooden-wheeled horse-drawn carts, handcarts, and many wooden boats. At the same time, they also built more than 100 horse-drawn cart roads and canals connecting various lakes and marshes. Every morning, a professional army composed of 6,000 Bai and Han women, carrying iron rakes, jumped on newly built wooden boats, and used bamboo poles to break the thin ice on the water to salvage sea mud and seaweed from the scattered lakes and marshes. More than 6,000 male commune members of all ethnic groups drove horse-drawn carts and handcarts along the newly built roads to the edge of the mountainous forests to dig up old soil and decayed leaves. The Yi and Bai commune members in the mountainous areas drove more than 10,000 cattle and sheep to the Han people's fields in the plains to graze. In order to accumulate fertilizer, they built "mobile stables" on the edges of the spring crop fields, which were filled with tree leaves and turf. During the day, the cattle and sheep were kept inside, and at night, for fear of the livestock catching cold, they were driven back to the village. In this way, fertilizer could be delivered to the fields without transportation, saving a large amount of labor. (Attached picture)

### 公社化更有利于民族团结共同跃进  邓川县各族人民大协作

    公社化更有利于民族团结共同跃进
    邓川县各族人民大协作
    本报昆明1日电　记者叶子健报道：云南省大理白族自治州邓川县实现人民公社化以后，进一步加强了县内山区和平原的民族团结，各民族相互协作，相互帮助，大搞工具改革，大搞积肥运动，从而推动了生产更大跃进。
    邓川县有汉、白、回、彝、傣、藏等六个民族共六万八千多人，其中白族最多，占人口的一半以上。汉、白、回等族多住在平原。彝族多住在山区。住在平原的民族以种稻谷为主，并擅长饲养奶牛和打渔。去年全县水稻平均亩产达一千三百多斤，在云南省数第一。山区的民族会种旱地，他们种的洋芋、荞麦都获得高产。他们还长于畜牧，并经营着大片经济林木和果园。但山区和平原也各有缺陷，山区缺大米，蔬菜和喂养牲畜的稻草；平原区少木柴和小春籽种等。过去因为互相供应问题，民族之间不免发生一些小纠纷。1956年，全县实现了高级合作化，平原和山区分别办了三十四个高级社，农业社间互相调剂，初步地解决了这些问题。但有一些问题高级社仍然无法彻底解决。
    为了适应生产大跃进的形势，去年10月间中共邓川县委根据各族人民的要求，把三十四个农业社合并起来建立了两个人民公社。两个公社都有平原和山区。公社建立后，首先就面临到秋收秋种和大战钢铁铜两大任务，劳动量与运输量比1957年同期增加了好几倍。在此情况下，中共邓川县委和公社党委根据公社化后的有利条件，决定团结各族的力量统一安排山区平原的资源，掀起大搞工具改革的群众运动，以节省劳动力。公社确定山区彝族和一部分白族社员，主要进行砍伐木料和挖洋芋，尽最大努力满足平原区制造新式农具和洋芋籽种的需要。平原区的汉、白、回等族社员，主要负责秋收秋种和具体进行工具改革。这样，山区的木料便源源不断地运下山，平原区的各族铁匠、木匠、农民都一齐下田研究如何改进工具。在很短的时间内，全县就制成了三万多件新式农具和近万件畜力车和手推车，加上过去高级社造的，平均每个劳动力有了三件新式农具和一部车子，每个生产队都有了一套马拉或脚踩的打谷机，筛谷机、风箱和几部畜力车和许多手推车。在丰收的田野上，很少看见人打谷、筛谷、背谷和扬场。一部筛谷机代替五十多人在工作，一个风箱代替三十多人扬场，各族社员们一面秋收，一面深翻稻田土，做到了稻倒田翻身。这时山区又给平原调运了一百多万斤刚收下的洋芋种，平原也给山上调去了一百多万斤米。山下山上的社员都很满意。
    为了争取更大的丰收，目前邓川县各族人民又携起手来，掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥高潮。不久前，山区的社员又给平原的社员送下来了大批木料，赶制了近万部胶轮、木轮马车、手推车和许多木船。同时，还修了一百多条马车路和沟通各个湖沼的水渠。每天清晨，六千白、汉族妇女组成的专业大军，带上铁耙，跳上新制的木船，用竹篙点破水上的薄冰，到星罗棋布的湖沼捞海泥海草。六千多名各族男社员驾起马车和手推车，顺着新修的大路，奔赴山区森林边缘挖掘陈土腐叶。山区的彝族、白族社员赶着一万多只牛羊，到平原区的汉族地里去放牧。为了积肥，他们在小春地边修建了“活动厩”，里面垫满了树叶草皮。白天把牛羊关在里面，晚上怕牲畜受凉，再把它们赶回村里去。这样，不用运输就能把肥料送到地里，节约了一大半劳动力。（附图片）
