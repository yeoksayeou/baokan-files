Hold High the Red Banner of the General Line and Leap Forward
Saifuddin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region

The great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958 wrote a glorious page in the history of socialist construction in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In this year, various construction undertakings in the autonomous region achieved brilliant accomplishments, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front also achieved a decisive victory.

Under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of Xinjiang, with soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor, achieved the leap-forward development of various construction projects. The double leap forward in industry and agriculture first promoted the double harvest of steel and grain. Cotton reached 1.47 million dan. The irrigated area expanded by water conservancy construction was 30% more than the total irrigated area expanded during the first five-year plan. In the past, it was believed that water conservancy projects could not be built in Xinjiang in winter. After the practice in 1958, this conservative argument was completely shattered. Not only were general projects built, but also many large-scale projects were built. Animal husbandry production also achieved great results, creating and promoting intensive breeding methods for sheep, with two lambs a year, accelerating the development of animal husbandry. We realized the rural people's commune system in a very short period of time. In terms of industry, a million people were mobilized to produce steel, and in just two months, we captured 182,000 tons of pig iron and 35,000 tons of steel, making steel production advance by leaps and bounds. Coal, electricity, machinery manufacturing, petroleum, and transportation all had great leaps forward. The products of local industries are even more "innovative". Tractors, generators, universal lathes, and small metallurgical equipment that could not be produced in the past have been successfully trial-produced, and some have been produced in complete sets. The broad masses have adopted the method of self-reliance, focusing on indigenous methods, and vigorously running various industries, forming a high tide of counties and communes running factories. Overnight, a spring breeze blew, and flowers bloomed all over the garden. Small-scale industries were dotted everywhere, covering urban and rural areas. More than 33,000 small-scale factories and mines were run below the county level. The situation where the autonomous region's industry only had "points" but no "surface" has begun to change, and each prefecture and autonomous prefecture has its own small steel base. The result of the whole people running geology and the whole people looking for minerals is that we have found thousands of mineral deposits, and coal and iron resources are almost all over Xinjiang. The whole people running industry and the whole people making steel not only have great economic significance, but also have far-reaching political influence. It makes us understand that running industry and making steel are not so mysterious and unreachable; it makes us realize that "poor" and "blank" are not terrible, but what is terrible is the lack of revolutionary enthusiasm. As long as we give full play to the revolutionary drive of the whole Party and the whole people, be good at learning, and work hard and cleverly, we can overcome difficulties and make the various construction projects in the autonomous region leap forward.

The all-people rectification movement, especially the socialist education in the countryside and the struggle against local nationalism, has achieved great victories of historical significance. Anti-local nationalism is a serious political struggle that exposed and crushed the conspiracy of local nationalists to separate Xinjiang from the motherland and undermine the construction of the autonomous region, unprecedentedly enhancing the communist consciousness of all cadres and the broad masses, thereby enabling the unity of the Party and the unity of all nationalities in Xinjiang to reach a new and higher stage.

The comprehensive great leap forward in 1958 was a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, the result of strengthening the Party's leadership, vigorously launching mass movements, and constantly fighting against all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas. Our autonomous region is both poor and blank, therefore, the broad masses are even more eager to change this backward situation, and their enthusiasm for construction is particularly high, and their determination to implement the general line is even more firm. However, some cadres are not aware of this, emphasizing Xinjiang's backwardness, emphasizing Xinjiang's specialness, and believing that Xinjiang can only advance gradually and cannot leap forward. According to the spirit of the Central Government's important meetings, the Autonomous Region Party Committee repeatedly criticized this erroneous understanding, cleared various ideological obstacles on the road to the leap forward, laid the ideological foundation for the leap forward, and made the leap forward thought develop step by step in the struggle against conservative thought. On this ideological basis, we vigorously launched mass movements, which made the socialist and communist consciousness of the masses higher and higher through the movements, and their revolutionary drive greater and greater, making our socialist construction undertakings vigorous and rapidly developing forward.

Xinjiang has a vast territory and abundant resources. We not only have the mineral and power resources necessary for the development of industry, but also have excellent conditions for the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The endless treasures of the Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains, the petroleum of the Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan Basins, and 160 million mu of wasteland suitable for agricultural reclamation are all waiting for our development. The people of Xinjiang are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, to gradually utilize them according to the overall plan of the country, so that they can better serve the socialist construction cause of the motherland. According to the preliminary long-term plan of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, we must build the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region into one of the industrial bases of the motherland for steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, textiles, and sugar making, and build the Autonomous Region into a cotton planting base. We are fully confident that we will realize this plan in the near future.

Of course, this is just a direction for struggle. However, this ambitious goal inspires the fighting spirit of the six million people of Xinjiang, and encourages us to greet a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 with greater enthusiasm. To achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, the most important thing is to resolutely implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to boost our energy, strive for the upstream, and be good at combining the Central Government's instructions with the specific conditions of Xinjiang, and carry out work creatively.

To complete and overfulfill the above tasks, first of all, we must continue to strengthen and develop the close unity of all nationalities and develop socialist ethnic relations. After nine years of practice, especially the practice of the struggle against local nationalism last year, we have become more clearly aware of this. The bourgeois view of nationality and the proletarian view of nationality are opposed to each other. Without resolutely opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism, it is impossible to establish solid socialist ethnic relations, consolidate the unification of the motherland, and make the socialist construction of the autonomous region develop at a high speed. It should be said that after the past struggle against Han chauvinism, especially the victory of the struggle against local nationalism last year, the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang are united and have established socialist ethnic relations. However, the remnants of this reactionary ideology have not been eliminated, and may even grow again under certain circumstances. Therefore, we still need to fight against Han chauvinism and local nationalism at any time. In the future, our task is to further strengthen national unity on the basis of the victory in opposing local nationalism, especially to strengthen the unity between local ethnic groups and the Han nationality, help each other, and learn from each other.

Secondly, we must properly solve the problem of labor force. The labor force in the autonomous region is relatively tight, which has a certain impact on socialist construction. The most important way to solve this problem is to give full play to the labor potential of the six million people, better give play to the role of the existing labor force, and improve labor efficiency. For example, rationally allocate the labor force, improve labor organization, improve labor methods, and actively increase mechanical equipment, etc. On the other hand, we sincerely thank the relevant provinces and cities for their strong support to Xinjiang in terms of labor force, and we warmly welcome young people from the mainland to come to Xinjiang to participate in the construction of the motherland's border areas.

Finally, we must continue to boost our energy, carry out large-scale mass movements, and set off new upsurges. In 1958, we gained a lot of valuable experience in this regard. This experience should be well summarized and applied, so that it can blossom and bear fruit in the construction of 1959 and play a greater role. As long as we now seize all tasks and continue to seize them, there will be a reliable guarantee for the realization of the 1959 tasks.

    高举总路线的红旗飞跃前进
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记新疆维吾尔自治区主席  赛福鼎
    1958年的社会主义建设大跃进，在新疆维吾尔自治区的社会主义建设历史上写下了光辉的一页。这一年里，自治区的各项建设事业获得了辉煌的成就，政治思想战线上的社会主义革命也取得了决定性的胜利。
    新疆人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，以冲天的干劲和忘我的劳动，换得了各项建设的飞跃发展。工、农业的双跃进，首先促成了钢铁、粮食的两大丰收。棉花达到一百四十七万担。因兴修水利而扩大的灌溉面积比第一个五年计划期间扩大灌溉面积的总和还多30％。过去认为新疆冬天不能修建水利工程，经过1958年的实践，彻底粉碎了这种保守论调，不仅修了一般的工程，而且还修了许多大型工程。畜牧业生产成绩也很大，创造和推广了羊只密集繁殖法，一年两羔，加速了畜牧业的发展。我们在很短的时间内实现了农村人民公社化。在工业方面，动员了百万人民大搞钢铁，在短短的两个月时间里，我们夺得了十八万二千吨生铁、三万五千吨钢，使钢铁生产突飞猛进。煤、电、机械制造、石油和交通运输，都有很大的跃进。地方工业的产品更是“推陈出新”，过去不能生产的拖拉机、发电机、万能车床以及小型冶金设备等，都已试制成功，有的已成套生产。广大群众采取了自力更生，以土为主的办法，大办各种工业，形成了县县、社社办工厂的高潮，一夜春风、满园花开，小型工业星罗棋布，遍布城乡，县以下办的小型厂矿达到三万三千多个。自治区的工业只有“点”没有“面”的情况已经开始改变，在每个专区、自治州都有了自己的小型钢铁基地。全民办地质、全民找矿的结果，使我们找到了数以千计的矿点，煤、铁资源几乎遍布全疆各地。全民办工业，全民炼钢铁不仅有极大的经济意义，而且具有深远的政治影响。使我们懂得了办工业、搞钢铁并不那么神秘，高不可攀；使我们认识到“穷”和“白”并不可怕，可怕的只是缺乏革命的热情。只要充分发挥全党全民的革命干劲，善于学习，实干巧干，我们就能战胜困难，使自治区的各项建设飞跃前进。
    全民整风运动，特别农村的社会主义教育和反对地方民族主义的斗争，取得了具有历史意义的伟大胜利。反地方民族主义是一场严肃的政治斗争，揭露和粉碎了地方民族主义分子企图使新疆脱离祖国、破坏自治区的建设的阴谋，空前地提高了全体干部和广大群众的共产主义觉悟，从而使新疆党的团结和各民族的团结达到了一个崭新的、更高的阶段。
    1958年的全面大跃进，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是加强了党的领导，大搞群众运动，不断地与形形色色的右倾保守思想作斗争的结果。我们自治区是又穷又白，因此，广大群众也就更加迫切地要求改变这种落后面貌，建设热情特别高涨，执行总路线的决心更为坚决。但是，也有一部分干部却认识不到这一点，强调新疆落后，强调新疆特殊，认为新疆只能渐进，不能跃进。自治区党委根据中央历次重要会议的精神，反复地批判了这种错误的认识，扫清了跃进道路上的各种思想障碍，打下了跃进的思想基础，并使跃进思想在与保守思想的斗争中，一步一步得到发展。在这个思想基础上，大搞群众运动，使群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟通过运动越来越高，革命干劲越来越大，使我们的社会主义建设事业搞得都轰轰烈烈，飞速地向前发展。
    新疆幅员广阔，各种资源十分丰富。我们不仅具有发展工业必须的矿藏和动力资源，而且有优厚的发展农、林、牧、副、渔业的条件。阿尔泰山、天山和昆仑山无尽的宝藏，准噶尔、塔里木和吐鲁番盆地的石油，一亿六千万亩宜于农垦的荒地，都等待着我们的开发。新疆人民有决心在党中央的领导下，根据全国总的计划，逐步地加以利用，使它们更好地为祖国的社会主义建设事业服务。根据自治区党委的初步远景规划，我们要把新疆维吾尔自治区建成为祖国的钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、纺织和制糖的工业基地之一，把自治区建成为植棉的基地。我们完全有信心在不远的将来实现这个规划。
    当然，这只是一个奋斗的方向。但是，这个远大的目标却鼓舞着新疆六百万人民的斗志，鼓舞着我们以更大的干劲来迎接1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。1959年要能更好更全面的跃进，最重要的是要坚决贯彻党的八届六中全会精神，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，并善于把中央的指示和新疆的具体情况结合起来，创造性地进行工作。
    要完成和超额完成上述任务，首先必须继续加强和发展各民族亲密无间的团结，发展社会主义的民族关系。经过九年来的实践，特别是去年反地方民族主义斗争的实践，使我们更加清楚地认识到了这一点。资产阶级的民族观和无产阶级的民族观是对立的，不坚决反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，就不可能建立起巩固的社会主义民族关系，巩固祖国的统一，也不可能使自治区的社会主义建设高速度的发展。应该说，经过了过去反对大民族主义，特别是去年反地方民族主义斗争的胜利，新疆各民族之间是团结的，已经建立了社会主义的民族关系。但是，这种反动思想的残余并没有扫除，并且在某种情况下还可能重新滋长。因此，我们还需要随时与大民族主义和地方民族主义进行斗争。今后我们的任务是在反对地方民族主义胜利的基础上，进一步加强民族团结，特别是加强本地各民族和汉族的团结，互相帮助，互相学习。
    其次是妥善解决劳动力的问题。自治区的劳动力是比较紧张的，对于社会主义建设有一定的影响。解决这个问题最主要的办法，是要充分发挥六百万人民的劳动潜力，更好地发挥现有劳动力的作用，提高劳动效率。例如合理进行劳动力的调配，改善劳动组织，改进劳动方法，积极增加机械设备等等。另一方面，我们衷心的感谢有关省、市在劳动力方面对新疆的大力支援，我们热忱地欢迎内地青年到新疆来，参加祖国边疆的建设。
    最后要继续鼓足干劲，搞大规模的群众运动，掀起新的高潮。1958年在这方面我们有了很多宝贵的经验，这些经验要很好地加以总结和运用，让它在1959年的建设中开花结果，起到更大的作用。只要我们现在就抓紧各项工作，并且一直抓下去，实现1959年的任务就有了可靠的保证。
