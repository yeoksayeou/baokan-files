    More Reports on the New Look of Remote Areas
    The special page "Flowers Bloom on Leigong Mountain, Miao and Dong Brothers Leap Forward" on the fifth page of the February 15th edition comprehensively introduced the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture from political, economic, and historical perspectives. Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture is my hometown. It was the first time I returned home after six years, and I couldn't even find my own door. The original open space had been replaced by rows of houses. But that was two years ago. Today, the Qian-Gui Railway has been completed, and new factories and schools are appearing in large numbers, making my hometown even more prosperous and beautiful.
    Our motherland is so vast. People are very concerned about the new look of the remote areas since the Great Leap Forward, and how the fraternal ethnic groups are building a happy life under the leadership of the Party. I hope there will be more reports in the future.　Kaifeng, Henan　Zong Wen

    多报道边远地区新面貌
    2月15日第五版上“雷公山上花似锦，苗侗兄弟大跃进”这个专页，从政治、经济、历史沿革等方面全面地介绍了黔东南苗族侗族自治州。黔东南苗族侗族自治州是我的家乡，我在离家六年后第一次回乡，竟连家门都找不到了，原来的旷地上盖起了一幢幢的房屋。但那是两年前的事。今天，黔桂铁路已经修通，新的工厂、学校大批出现，家乡更繁荣美丽了。
    我们祖国这样辽阔，边远地区大跃进以来的新面貌，兄弟民族在党的领导下如何建设幸福的生活，都是人们十分关心的。希望今后更多地报道。　河南开封　宗文
