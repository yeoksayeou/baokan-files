    Moscow's First Satellite City Under Construction

    Not long ago, the first satellite city of the Soviet capital could only be seen on design drawings. Now, near Kryukovo Station, the outlines of some buildings can already be seen. Construction of the satellite city is underway and is expected to be basically completed in 1962 or 1963. At that time, some of Moscow's enterprises, mainly some factories in the electrical manufacturing, light industry, and food industries, will be relocated here, and about 65,000 residents will also move here.

    The first building completed in the satellite city is a substation. A concrete component factory is now under construction, which will supply various components needed for the construction of the new city. In addition, youth worker schools, two secondary technical schools, shops, and canteens are also being built on their foundations.

    The satellite city is located in a beautiful wooded area more than 30 kilometers from Moscow. This small city, covering an area of 2,000 hectares, uses less than half of the area for construction, and 1,020 hectares will be forests and orchards.

    The residential area of the satellite city is truly excellent. The residential area is separated from the factory area by forests, and the residential areas will also be built next to forests and ponds. Each small residential area accommodates about 6,500 people, with schools, shops, and other cultural facilities. The residential buildings are basically four stories high, each building has a small garden, and each family has a set of rooms. In addition, the city center also has theaters, cinemas, large department stores, sports fields, etc. One can imagine that Moscow's first satellite city will be a garden-like beautiful city.

    建设中的莫斯科第一个卫星城
    不久以前，苏联首都的第一座卫星城，还只能在设计图上看到。如今，在克留科沃车站附近，已经可以看到一些建筑物的轮廓了。卫星城正在动工兴建，在1962年或1963年就可以基本建成。那时，莫斯科市的一些企业，主要是电器制造业、轻工业和食品工业的一些工厂，就要迁到这里来，同时还大约有六万五千居民也要搬到这里来住。
    目前卫星城中已经落成的第一所建筑物是变电所。现在正在建筑混凝土构件工厂，这个工厂要供应新城市建筑所需的各种构件。此外，青年工人学校、两所中等技术专科学校、商店和食堂等，也都在打地基。
    卫星城座落在距莫斯科三十多公里的风景优美的林区。这座占地二千公顷的小城市，用于建筑的面积还不到一半，有一千零二十公顷都将是树林和果园。
    卫星城的住宅区真是再好不过了。住宅区同工厂区之间有树林隔开，而且住宅区还都要傍着树林、水池建造。每一个小住宅区约住六千五百人，学校、商店和其他文化设施应有尽有。住宅用楼基本上都是四层的，每座楼都附有小花园，每家一套房间。除此之外，市中心还有剧院、电影院、大百货商店、运动场等。可以想像，莫斯科第一座卫星城，将是花园般美丽的城市。（附图片）
