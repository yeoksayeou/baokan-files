Xinhua News Agency, Salisbury, February 25th: Approximately six thousand African workers constructing the Kariba Dam in the Zambezi River basin in Southern Rhodesia initiated a general strike today, demanding increased wages. All work on the dam has been brought to a standstill.

The strike was initially launched on the 24th by approximately nine hundred workers engaged in arduous labor beneath the ground of the dam. Reports indicate that a severe accident on the 20th precipitated the strike. On that day, fourteen Africans and three Europeans perished after falling into a tunnel leading to an underground power plant.

During their strike on the 24th, the African workers chanted slogans such as "We don't want to die for four pence." Despite the deployment of additional police as a threat by the authorities, the workers persisted in their struggle and refused to return to work.

The basic wage for these African workers is a mere four pence per hour. (Attached picture)

    南罗得西亚六千工人罢工
    反对殖民当局的残酷剥削
    新华社25日讯　南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里消息：在南罗得西亚桑比西河流域，正在修建卡里巴水坝的全部非洲籍工人约六千人今天举行了总罢工，要求增加工资。这座水坝的工程已全部陷于停顿状态。
    这次罢工是由大约九百名在这座水坝地面下面从事艰苦劳动的工人在24日首先发动的。有消息说，在20日发生的一次严重事故促成了这次罢工。在这一天，十四名非洲人和三名欧洲人因掉入通向一座地下发电厂的坑道而牺牲了生命。
    这些非洲工人在24日罢工时高喊“我们不愿为四便士而死亡”的口号。虽然当局增派了许多警察加以威胁，工人们仍坚持斗争，拒绝复工。
    这些非洲籍工人的基本工资每小时只有四个便士。（附图片）
