    Private Overseas Trade in the Yuan Dynasty
    Liu Mianzhi
    Shen Wansanxiu, a famous wealthy man in Nanjing at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, was said in folklore to have a cornucopia that could produce any treasure he desired. According to the Wu Jiang County Annals, Shen Wansan was originally engaged in overseas trade, which was called "communication with foreigners" at that time. The county annals say:
        Shen Wansanxiu had a residence in Zhouzhuang, 29th capital of Wu Jiang, and his wealth
    was unmatched in the world. It is said that he obtained it through communication with foreigners. When Zhang Shicheng occupied Wu, Shen
    Wansan was already dead, and his two sons, Mao and Wang, secretly transported rice to Yanjing by sea.
    After Zhang Shicheng was destroyed by Zhu Yuanzhang, Zhu Yuanzhang deeply resented the local landlords and wealthy people for supporting Zhang Wu's resistance, and forced them all to move to Nanjing. Huang Wei's "Peng Chuang Lei Ji" says: Shen Wansan was originally named Shen Fu, and ranked third. The people of Wu all called him Shen Wansanxiu, and he was the wealthiest family in Jiangnan at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. After Emperor Taizu of Ming established his capital in Nanjing, he demanded that the Shen family offer 1,000 ingots (50 taels per ingot) of white silver and 100 catties of gold every year. He also required the Shen family to supply money and grain for military horses during wartime. During the confiscation of his property, he had several thousand hectares of fields, and the tax was fixed at 9.3 dou per mu. The heavy land tax in Jiangsu began with his family. Other records also mention the story of Emperor Taizu of Ming forcing the Shen family to build the city wall of Nanjing.
    In the 14th century, private overseas trade was very developed in the southeastern coastal areas. In addition to the Shen Wansan family, Tao Zongyi's "辍耕录" mentioned Zhang Cun from Hangzhou, who went to Quanzhou in 1336 AD to make a fortune in sea trade. He returned to Hangzhou in 1342 and said that he had obtained a piece of sacred iron overseas (Volume 23). And the Shen family of Dachang in Jiading Prefecture became extremely wealthy because of going overseas to do business (Volume 27). Song Lian's "翰苑续集" Volume 4 records that the Lin family, a sea merchant from Fuzhou, drove large ships to and from overseas countries, with flags and drums displayed on the ships, and often took precautions to prevent pirates from robbing them. Mai Quan and eleven others from the South China Sea were imprisoned for privately selling foreign goods. Even earlier, the "History of Yuan Dynasty: Biography of Lu Shirong" records that in 1285 AD, it was decided that the government would build ships and provide capital at the Quanzhou and Hangzhou Shipping Department, recruiting merchants to go to sea for trade. The government would take 70% of the profit and the merchants would take 30%, and private sea voyages were strictly prohibited. In 1314, Tiemudieer suggested that in the past, wealthy people went to foreign countries to trade and made a lot of money, and more and more people went abroad. The price of Chinese goods was low, and foreign goods became more and more expensive. The state should manage it in a unified way, and assign the Right Minister of Jiangzhe to be in charge, issue ten ships, recruit merchants and give them certificates, and the government would collect taxes, and the privately trafficked goods would be confiscated.
    Volume 4 of "Yuan Wen Lei" contains three "Ballads of Ships":
    Zhu (Qing) and Zhang (Xuan) have been dead for more than ten years, and the sea bandits are scarce and the sea merchants are many. When the south wind arrives on the shore in June, the flower-decorated oarsmen and sailors are happy.
    Ryukyu, Zhenla, and Java are connected to Japan, Chenhan, Huimo, and Wa. When foreign ships leave, they drop their anchors, and there are no waves at sea every year.
    Frankincense, pepper, and castoreum, pearls, ivory, and rhinoceros horns. Don't look at them as rare treasures in the world, they can make heroes' values ​​drop to the bottom.
    The countries reached included Ryukyu, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea, and the goods traded included spices, medicinal materials, pearls, ivory, rhino horns, and so on.
    From this, it seems that the reason why the Shen Wansan family in Suzhou became wealthy was because of overseas trade. The reason why they were offended and moved to Nanjing and later had their property confiscated was because they supported Zhang Shicheng and the Yuan Dynasty, which is generally credible.
    It was precisely because there was already frequent private foreign trade in the 14th century, and the coastal people possessed the knowledge, skills, and accumulated experience in navigation and commerce, that it laid the foundation for Zheng He's seven voyages to the West in the first half of the 15th century, such a large-scale merchant fleet.

    元代的民间海外贸易
    刘勉之
    元末南京有名的大财主沈万三秀，民间故事相传他家有聚宝盆，要什么宝贝就有什么。据吴江县志，原来沈万三是作海外贸易的，这一行当时叫作通番。县志说：
        沈万三秀有宅在吴江二十九都周庄，富
    甲天下，相传由通番而得。张士诚据吴时，沈
    万三已死，二子茂、旺密由海道运米至燕京。
    张士诚被朱元璋所灭，朱元璋深恨当地的地主富豪支持张吴抵抗，把他们都强迫搬到南京。黄暐蓬窗类记说：沈万三原来叫沈富，排行第三，吴人都称他作沈万三秀，是元末江南第一富家。明太祖定都南京以后，要沈家每年献白金千锭（锭五十两），黄金百斤。用兵时的甲马钱粮，也要他家供给。抄家时有田几千顷，每亩定赋九斗三升，江苏田赋之重是由他家开始的。另外一些记载还记有明太祖强迫沈家修南京城墙的故事。
    十四世纪时，东南沿海的民间海外贸易很发达，除沈万三家以外，陶宗仪辍耕录里提到杭州人张存，公元1336年到泉州，作海舶买卖发财，1342年回到杭州，说曾在海外得到一块圣铁（卷二十三）。和嘉定州大场沈家，因下番作买卖成巨富（卷二十七）。宋濂翰苑续集四记福州海贾林家驾着大舶，往来海外诸国，舶上张列旗帜和金鼓，经常戒备着，以防海盗抢劫。南海麦全等十一人以私卖外国货坐牢。再前些时候，元史卢世荣传记公元1285年决定在泉州、杭州市舶都转运司，由官家造船给本，招商人出海贩运，得利官有其七，商有其三，严禁私自泛海。1314年铁木迭儿建议，过去富民到外国商贩，大赚其钱，出国的人越来越多。中国商品价格低，外国货越来越贵。应该由国家统一管理，责成江浙右丞专管，发船十纲，招商给予证明文件，由官收税，私贩的货物充公。
    元文类卷四有舶上谣三首：
    朱（清）张（瑄）死去十年过，海寇雕零海贾多，南风六月到岸酒，花股篙丁奈乐何。
    琉球真腊接闍婆，日本辰韩濊貊倭，番船去时遣矴石，年年到处海无波。
    熏陆胡椒腽肭齐，明珠象齿骇鸡犀，世间莫作珍奇看，解使英雄价尽低。
    所到的国家有琉球、柬埔寨、印度尼西亚、日本、朝鲜等国，贩运的商品有香料药材和珍珠象牙犀角等等。
    由此看来，苏州沈万三这一家之所以发财，是由于作海外贸易，所以得罪被迁到南京和后来的抄家，是因为支持张士诚和元朝，大体上是可信的。
    正因为十四世纪已经有了频繁的民间对外贸易，沿海人民具备了航海的知识技能和通商的经验的积累，这样，就为十五世纪上半期的郑和七下西洋，那样规模巨大的商船队打下了基础。
