    刚果人民坚决要求自由  民族解放运动发展迅速
    比当局在刚果首府又大事逮捕
    据新华社讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果“前途报”记者斯坦尼斯拉在一条电讯中说，民族解放运动已经迅速地在全刚果的非洲居民中展开了。除了刚果民族主义组织“阿巴科”协会会员外，来自各部落和各种组织的人民也都参加了这一运动。
    斯坦尼斯拉写道，他曾经同许多非洲居民谈过话，而所有这些人都渴望看到他们的国家获得自由。
    在这星期曾经发生过几起反抗行动的登达尔县（在利奥波德维尔省），比利时殖民军队和警察30日早晨黎明时分进行了大规模的搜索活动。据警察局发言人供认，这次搜索一共逮捕了一百人。他还宣布，宵禁已经在郊区强制实行。
    新华社1日讯　据英国广播公司今天广播，在刚果首都利奥波德维尔又进行了大规模的逮捕。自从1月27日以来，比利时殖民当局大约逮捕了一千五百人，并且已经对其中两百人起诉。刚果政府会议的一名非洲籍委员也被拘留起来。
    比利时殖民军队从1月30日早晨起就包围了利奥波德维尔市区。当天军警在登达尔区（利奥波德维尔的非洲居民住区）进行大规模的搜捕活动，一共逮捕了六百二十人。
    许多人已经被驱逐出利奥波德维尔。曾经有消息说，几个星期以来比利时殖民当局就一直准备大批驱逐主张立即给予这个殖民地独立的民主分子。
