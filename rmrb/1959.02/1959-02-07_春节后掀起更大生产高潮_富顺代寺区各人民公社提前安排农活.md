Spur a Greater Production Upsurge After the Spring Festival
Daishi District People's Communes in Fushun Make Early Arrangements for Farm Work
Chengdu, February 6th (reported by this newspaper) – The People's Communes in Daishi District, Fushun County, Sichuan Province, have recently made specific arrangements for production activities after the Spring Festival, so that everyone can go all out with even greater enthusiasm as soon as the Spring Festival is over, pushing the already vigorously launched large-scale production campaign to a new high.

Recently, the production campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer is in full swing in the People's Communes of Daishi District. In the past seven days, the nine communes in the district have accumulated more than 2.244 billion jin of fertilizer and irrigated more than 64,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed. In terms of water conservancy projects, more than 980,000 cubic meters of earthwork were excavated.

The Party committees of each commune considered that the time is very tight once the Spring Festival is over, as "Rain Water" (a solar term) approaches. Therefore, in addition to taking a three-day holiday starting from the 7th as stipulated and arranging rich and varied festive activities for the members to have a happy and lively Spring Festival, they also put forward the slogan "Don't forget production during the festival." They also took many measures ideologically and organizationally to ensure that every member has a stronger production mood after the Spring Festival and immediately joins the battle, so as to prevent possible slackening due to the festival. The production teams, schools, factories, and mines of Tongsi People's Commune held meetings and unanimously stated that they would rest early on the last night of the holiday and go to work early the next day. Cadres and members are required to achieve "three clarifications." Cadres must be clear about which front they are on, who they lead, and where the battle area is. Members must be clear about what work to do, how much the task is, and where the work location is.

The Daishi People's Commune also specifically held a rally to ensure a greater production upsurge after the Spring Festival, and formulated a combat plan for the first day and one week after the Spring Festival through mass discussion. Party members and League members are required to take the lead, and cadres are assigned to contract areas. Qilong People's Commune also held a great airing of views and a great debate from inside and outside the Party, calculated the labor account for February and the production increase account for this year, so that members realized the great significance of immediately launching a production upsurge after the Spring Festival. At the same time, the commune's more than 5,000 laborers were carefully arranged, divided into three fronts: fertilizer accumulation, field management of spring crops, and water conservancy construction, and various tasks were assigned to individuals, achieving four determinations: determine the person, determine the task, determine the time, and determine the quality. Many members improved their understanding through debate. Some said that they would return on time when visiting relatives and would not delay production; some said that they would take the time to repair agricultural tools during the Spring Festival for use after the Spring Festival. All cadres and members proposed to guarantee 100% attendance on the first day after the holiday, and to achieve full attendance in the week after the Spring Festival. (Liu Zongtang, Fan Sui)

    春节后掀起更大生产高潮
    富顺代寺区各人民公社提前安排农活
    本报成都6日电　四川省富顺县代寺区各人民公社，最近对春节过后的生产活动，作了具体安排，以便春节一过，大家就能鼓足更大的干劲，把已经掀起的轰轰烈烈的大生产运动推向新的高潮。
    最近，代寺区各人民公社以积肥为中心的生产运动正搞得热火朝天，全区九个公社在最近七天内，积肥二十二亿四千多万斤，浇灌小麦和油菜六万四千多亩；在水利工程上，挖了九十八万多土方。
    各公社党委考虑到春节一过就是“雨水”，时间非常紧迫。因此，他们除了按照规定从7日起放假三天，并为社员安排了丰富多采的节日生活，使大家痛痛快快、热热闹闹过好春节外，还提出了“过节不忘生产”的口号，并在思想上、组织上采取了许多措施，保证使每个社员在春节后生产情绪更加旺盛，立即投入战斗，以防止可能因过节而出现的松懈情况。童寺人民公社各生产队和学校、厂矿都分别召开了会议，一致表示假期最后一天的晚上提早休息，第二天一早就出工。干部和社员都要求做到“三明确”。干部要明确自己是那条战线，领导那些人，战斗的地区在那里。社员要明确干啥活路，任务多大，出工地点。
    代寺人民公社还专门召开了保证春节后掀起更大生产高潮的誓师大会，通过群众讨论制定了春节后第一天和一个星期的战斗计划。要求党团员带头上阵，干部划片包干。奇龙人民公社还由党内到党外举行了大鸣大放大辩论，算了2月份的劳动账和今年增产账，使社员认识春节过后立即掀起生产高潮的重大意义。同时还将全社五千多个劳力作了周密安排，划分为积肥、小春作物田间管理和兴修水利等三个战线，并将各项任务下达到人，作到四定：定人、定任务、定时间、定质量。许多社员经过辩论提高了认识，有的表示走亲戚要按时赶回，不能耽误生产；有的表示春节期间要抽空修理农具，以便春节后使用。全体社干部和社员提出保证假期过后第一天百分之百的出工，春节后的一周内作到全勤满堂红。　（刘宗棠、范眭）
