Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th: The Pyongyang newspapers today published the report made by Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, on improving the quality of industrial products.

In his report, Kim Il emphasized that improving the quality of industrial products is one of the most important links in the current stage of socialist construction in North Korea. Therefore, the whole party and all the people must be mobilized to strive to raise the quality of North Korea's industrial products to the level of advanced countries in the next few years.

In his report, Kim Il said that the process of rapid development of the people's economy is not only a process of quantitative growth, but also a process of struggle to improve product quality. At present, North Korea's industrial production level is already four times that of the pre-war year of 1949. However, the improvement of product quality lags behind the growth of product quantity.

Kim Il said that in order to promote the development of productive forces, and especially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the working people, comprehensively improving product quality has become one of the most important economic tasks, while continuing to adhere to the high-speed development of production.

Kim Il said: At present, the production level of North Korea's machinery industry has increased to eight times that of the pre-war period, and it is able to manufacture various production equipment, tools, and parts to meet the needs of various economic sectors. In addition, the strength of science and technology has also increased to more than four times that of the pre-war period, and the technical level of employees has also greatly improved. All these facts show that North Korea is now fully capable and has the conditions to decisively improve product quality in a short period of time.

Kim Il pointed out that improving product quality does not mean increasing production costs, but rather systematically reducing costs and producing products that are better in performance, cheaper in price, and more durable in quality.

Kim Il emphasized that in order to comprehensively improve product quality, it is necessary to attach great importance to all links of production and distribution in various departments such as heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce. All departments and units must make good use of existing machinery and equipment, promote and apply advanced technologies and operating methods, and improve the technical level of workers. In addition, every employee should treat their work with a communist attitude.

Kim Il pointed out that the Party organizations at all levels should implement the task of improving quality as the central task of the current period to the masses, and mobilize the working people to carry out creative labor to produce more good-quality products that are compatible with the socialist era.

Kim Il finally said that we must continue to adhere to the unprecedented speed of developing the people's economy, not only to catch up with the level of advanced countries in terms of per capita industrial output, but also to improve product quality, in order to finally overwhelm capitalism and ascend to the peak of socialism.

    金一副首相在朝鲜劳动党中央全会报告
    力争短期内提高工业品质量
    新华社平壤25日电　平壤各报今天刊载了朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议上所作的关于提高工业产品质量的报告。
    金一在报告中强调指出，提高工业产品的质量是目前朝鲜社会主义建设阶段中最重要的环节之一。因此，要动员全党全民来努力在最近几年内把朝鲜的工业产品质量提高到先进国家的水平。
    金一在报告中说，人民经济的飞跃发展过程，不仅是数量增长的过程，也是为提高产品质量而斗争的过程。目前朝鲜的工业生产水平已经相当于战前1949年的四倍。但是，产品质量的提高落后于产品数量的增长。
    金一说，为了促进生产力的发展，特别是满足劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要，因此，在继续坚持高速度发展生产的同时，全面提高产品的质量就成为最重要的经济任务之一。
    金一说：目前朝鲜的机械工业生产水平已经增长到相当于战前的八倍，能够自己制造各种生产设备、工具和零件，满足各经济部门的需要。另外，科学技术力量也增长到相当于战前的四倍多，职工的技术水平也大大提高了。这一切事实说明，目前朝鲜已经充分具备了在短期间内决定性地提高产品质量的可能性和条件。
    金一指出，提高产品的质量，并不是要提高生产成本，而是要有计划地降低成本，生产性能更好、价格更便宜、质量更坚固的产品。
    金一强调指出，要全面提高产品质量，必须高度重视重工业、轻工业、农业、运输、商业等各个部门的一切生产和分配的环节，各个部门和单位要很好地利用现有的机械设备，推广和运用先进的技术和操作方法，提高工人的技术水平。另外，每个职工要以共产主义的态度来对待自己的工作。
    金一指出，劳动党各级组织要把提高质量作为当前的中心任务贯彻到群众中去，动员劳动人民为生产更多的、同社会主义时代相适应的质量良好的产品而进行创造性的劳动。
    金一最后说，我们要继续坚持以史无前例的速度发展人民经济，不仅要在按人口平均计算的工业品产量方面赶上先进国家的水平，并且一定要提高产品质量，以最后压倒资本主义，登上社会主义的高峰。
