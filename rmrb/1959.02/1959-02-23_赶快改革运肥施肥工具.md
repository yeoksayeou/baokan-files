Hasten the Reform of Manure Transportation and Application Tools
Zeng Zhi

It is now the time when wheat seedlings are turning green in most areas, requiring timely topdressing; summer harvest crops such as rapeseed and broad beans also need topdressing. Spring plowing and sowing are also imminent, and a large amount of base fertilizer must be applied to the fields quickly. How can we meet the fertilizer requirements of summer harvest crops and spring-sown crops? We must not only accumulate and produce fertilizer on a large scale; but also apply the accumulated fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner.

The mass movement of accumulating and producing fertilizer has already achieved brilliant results: generally, several times more fertilizer has been accumulated and produced than in previous years, and the quality of fertilizer has also increased compared to previous years. However, with a large quantity of fertilizer, a short application time, and a tight labor force, how to transport the fertilizer to the fields and apply it in time has become a pressing problem that needs to be solved. What to do? The most important method is to reform the manure transportation and application tools.

According to past experience, manure transportation and application require a particularly large labor force. In some places, the labor used for manure transportation alone accounts for more than one-third of the entire production process. If we still adopt the method of carrying by shoulder and human labor this year, the labor force will feel even more insufficient, and the progress will be too slow. Fan County in Shandong Province calculated the accounts before reforming the manure accumulation, transportation, and application tools: relying on the existing labor force, only 400 million jin of fertilizer can be accumulated daily; the speed of manure transportation is even slower. To meet the county party committee's requirement of applying 100,000 jin of topdressing per mu of wheat field and 100,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu of spring field, it would take a year to complete. Obviously, following the old methods of accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer cannot meet the needs of the objective situation. The Fan County Party Committee decided to lead the masses to launch a vigorous technical revolution and carry out large-scale tool reform. After a short period of hard work, the county reformed and manufactured more than 128,000 pieces of manure accumulation, transportation, and application tools. As a result, the situation has greatly changed: after the Zhang Anzhen manure transportation team in Yangji Management District realized "one cart per person," the average daily manure transportation increased from 1,500 jin per person by shoulder carrying to 8,500 jin. The Lizhuang team in Xincheng Management District used wooden rail carts to transport fertilizer, which increased work efficiency by more than ten times compared to shoulder carrying. The county's fertilizer accumulation increased from 400 million jin to more than 1.3 billion jin per day; the average topdressing application for 720,000 mu of wheat has reached more than 80,000 jin per mu, basically achieving accumulation, transportation, and application at the same time. Tool reform has played a decisive role in improving labor efficiency!

Reforming tools can not only improve labor efficiency, but also greatly reduce labor intensity, making people's labor easier, and enabling people with weaker labor to participate in manure transportation and application. Taking manure transportation as an example, in the past it was always carried by shoulder and human labor, and generally only strong laborers could afford such heavy labor. If tools such as carts, boats, cableways, and wooden rail soil trains are used for transportation, the physical burden of people will be greatly reduced even with the same manure transportation labor. In this way, labor efficiency can be increased many times over. We should seize the time, use high enthusiasm, and accelerate tool reform in manure transportation and application, which requires the most labor and has the greatest labor intensity, to ensure that fertilizer is delivered to the fields in time and applied to crops.

    赶快改革运肥施肥工具
    曾志
    目前正是大部地区麦苗返青的时候，需要及时追肥；油菜、蚕豆等夏收作物也正需要追肥。春耕春播又迫在眉睫，必须赶快把大量基肥施到地里。怎样才能满足夏收作物和春播作物对肥料的要求呢？既要大规模地积肥造肥；还要把所积的肥料及时施到地里。
    群众性的积肥造肥运动，已经取得了辉煌的战果：一般地区都已积造了比往年多几倍的肥料，优质肥料也比往年增加了。但是，在肥料数量大、施肥时间短而劳力又很紧张的情况下，如何及时把肥料运到地里、施下去，却成为当前一个迫切需要解决的问题。怎么办？最重要的办法是改革运肥施肥工具。
    根据历年情况看来，运肥、施肥需要的劳动力特别多。有些地方每年光运肥所用的工，就要占整个生产过程用工的三分之一以上。今年如果仍然采取肩挑人抬的运肥方法，劳动力就会更加感到不足，而且进度也太慢。山东范县在没有改革积肥运肥施肥工具以前，算了一笔账：依靠现有的劳动力每日只能积肥四亿斤；运肥速度更慢，要达到县委提出的每亩麦田追肥和春田施基肥各十万斤的要求，需要一年时间才能完成。显然，按照过去的老办法来积肥运肥施肥，是不能满足客观形势需要的了。范县县委决定领导群众大闹技术革命，大搞工具改革。经过短短一个时期的奋战，全县共改制了积肥运肥施肥工具十二万八千多件。于是，情况大大改变了：杨集管理区张安振运肥组实现了“每人一车”以后，由肩挑人抬每人每天平均运肥一千五百斤，提高到八千五百斤。莘城管理区李庄队用木轨斗车运肥，比肩挑人抬提高工效十倍以上。全县积肥由日进四亿斤增加到十三亿斤以上；七十二万亩小麦平均每亩追肥已达八万余斤，基本上做到了随积随运随施。工具改革对提高劳动效率起了决定的作用！
    改革工具不但可以提高劳动效率，而且可以大大减轻劳动强度，使人们劳动得更轻松一些，使劳力较弱的人也能够参加运肥、施肥的劳动。拿运肥来说吧，过去一直是肩挑人抬，一般只能壮劳力才担负得起这样重的劳动。如果改用车船、索道、木轨土火车等工具来运输，同样是运肥的劳动，人的体力负担就会大大减轻。这样，就可以成倍地提高劳动效率。应该抓紧时间，用高度的热情，在费劳力最多、劳动强度最大的运肥施肥方面加速进行工具改革，保证及时把肥料送到地里，给作物施上肥。
