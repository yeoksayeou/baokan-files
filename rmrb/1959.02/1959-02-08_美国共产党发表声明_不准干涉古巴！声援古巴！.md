Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th: According to TASS, New York, 6th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement entitled: "No Interference in Cuba! Support Free Cuba!"

The statement said that an increasing number of American working people welcome the democratic goals of the new Cuban government and its revolutionary laws against tyrants, murderers, and arsonists who tortured and slaughtered countless Cuban patriots.

It is no secret that Batista and his henchmen plundered Cuba's national wealth, just like the big Wall Street monopolies plundered the Cuban people. Therefore, there must be a strong revolutionary legal system to prevent Batista and those who support him with stolen millions from realizing their vicious conspiracy to subvert free Cuba.

Americans are increasingly aware that the Batista regime was so terrible in the past because it was plotted, led, and supported by US imperialism and its political representatives. They also understand that Batista's new and terrible activities attempting to suppress the revolution can only succeed with the open or covert support of the State Department and the FBI.

The statement emphasized that the mask of US imperialism must be torn off so that everyone can clearly see its true face and take corresponding actions to stop its open or covert interference, because this interference is still the main threat to the Cuban revolution.

"No Interference in Cuba": This is the answer of American workers and farmers, black people, students and intellectuals to all open or covert conspiracies of American big trusts and their government agents.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States calls on the American people to support the Cuban people's sacred aspirations for freedom, social progress, and world peace, and demands the implementation of a policy of friendship and amity with the Cuban people and the government of national liberation and democratic reform.

    美国共产党发表声明
    不准干涉古巴！声援古巴！
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：美国共产党全国委员会发表声明，声明的标题是：“不准干涉古巴！声援自由的古巴！”
    声明说，越来越多的美国劳动人民欢迎古巴新政府的民主目标和它反对暴虐者、杀人犯和放火者的革命法制，这些人曾经拷打和屠杀了无数的古巴爱国者。
    巴蒂斯塔和他的走狗掠夺古巴的民族财富已经不是秘密，就像华尔街的大垄断组织掠夺古巴人民一样。因此，必须有一个强有力的革命法制，使巴蒂斯塔和用偷来的上百万的金钱支持他的那些人无法实现他们想颠复自由古巴的恶毒阴谋。
    美国人越来越认识到：过去巴蒂斯塔政权之所以那样可怕，是因为有美帝国主义及其政治代表为它策划阴谋，对它进行领导和支持。他们也明白，巴蒂斯塔企图镇压革命的新的可怖活动只有在国务院和联邦调查局公开的或者隐蔽的支持下才能成功。
    声明着重指出，必须撕下美帝国主义的假面具，使大家能清楚地看到它的真面貌，并且采取相应的行动来制止它公开的或隐蔽的干涉，因为这种干涉仍然是对古巴革命的主要威胁。
      “不准干涉古巴”：这就是美国工人和农民、黑人、学生和知识分子对美国大托辣斯及其政府的代理人一切公开或隐蔽的阴谋活动的回答。
    美国共产党全国委员会号召美国人民支持古巴人争取自由、社会进步和世界和平的神圣愿望，并且要求执行同古巴人民和民族解放、民主改革的政府友好敦睦的政策。
