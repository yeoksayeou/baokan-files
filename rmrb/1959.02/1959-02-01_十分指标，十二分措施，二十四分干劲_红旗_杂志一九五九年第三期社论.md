"Red Flag" Magazine 1959, No. 3 Editorial

Last spring, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, put forward a resounding slogan: "Ten-part targets, twelve-part measures, twenty-four-part drive." This slogan quickly became popular throughout the country, becoming a fighting slogan welcomed by the masses, and played a positive role in the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958. This year is a decisive year in the three years of hard work, and the task of a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward is before us. The people in various regions are fighting on the industrial front to complete this year's plan of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, and a series of other production and capital construction projects, and at present, they must first strive to complete the plan for the first quarter. On the agricultural front, they are fighting to produce 1,050 billion catties of grain, 100 million dan of cotton, 6 million tons of edible vegetable oil, 20 million dan of hemp, and to realize the Ten Proposals adopted by the National Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representatives Conference. At present, the primary task is to concentrate on accumulating and producing fertilizer and to intensify the management of winter crops. At this time when a more magnificent production upsurge is coming, it is absolutely necessary to continue to advocate such a vivid and powerful slogan as "Ten-part targets, twelve-part measures, twenty-four-part drive."

The so-called ten-part targets are the highest targets within the possible range. The broad masses of cadres and people have a firm belief in high targets, because the practice of the Great Leap Forward last year has proved that the high targets set by the Party are bold, but they are also realistic. Therefore, as long as people make enough efforts, they can be fully realized. Being realistic does not mean facing the past and repeatedly repeating the facts that have already occurred, but rather standing on the level that has already been reached, taking a broad and long-term view, facing the future, and setting the targets at the highest limit that can be reached through effort. This year's targets of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1,050 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton are all aimed at the highest points that can be reached this year. Obviously, the national high targets must be based on the local high targets. Therefore, when formulating the annual plan, all localities must base themselves on reality, fully estimate all the favorable factors that can be mobilized, and set the targets at the "ten-part" level. Of course, the targets cannot be raised arbitrarily and infinitely. Ten parts is its general limit. We do not advocate insisting on putting forward eleven-part or twelve-part targets, because such targets are not reliable and are sometimes even impossible to achieve. Putting forward targets that are too high and that the masses cannot achieve will result in hurting the emotions and confidence of the masses. However, if, under the pretext of being stable and reliable, we do not put forward the ten-part targets that can be achieved through effort, but instead put forward eight-part or nine-part targets, this will inevitably make the conservatives and those who want to retreat to the less, slower, worse, and more expensive method of doing things feel happy, and will damage the enthusiasm and creativity of the majority of the masses in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and will inevitably hinder the completion of the 1959 Leap Forward plan. There is no doubt that we must resolutely prevent and correct this tendency and fight for upholding the principle of ten-part targets.

We do not advocate twelve-part targets, but we resolutely demand twelve-part measures. Why? It is not too difficult to set a high target; but to achieve this target requires great effort. Moreover, the actual development of life is always more complicated than people expect. When formulating targets, it is impossible to fully understand all the details of the entire process. Therefore, in the course of practice, we will often encounter some difficulties and setbacks that were not originally anticipated. Demanding twelve-part measures is precisely a concrete manifestation of our Communists' tactical emphasis on difficulties. It can make us more confident of being invincible. Thinking about any matter from the most difficult perspective will not cause us any losses, but can instead prompt us to arrange various tasks more carefully. Even if the difficulties are two parts more than expected, our measures are also two parts more, which can offset it. If such serious difficulties do not occur, because we have adopted twelve-part measures, the result is that we have reached twelve-part targets and achieved greater victories, which is of course even better.

This year, as far as the whole country is concerned, the growth rate of some products does not seem as high as last year, but the actual tasks are more arduous. This is because, first, the base number is larger, and although some indicators do not seem to have grown as fast as last year, the absolute number of growth is very large. For example, steel production increased by about 7 million tons compared to last year, and this figure is more than 1 million tons more than the total annual output in 1957. Grain increased by about 300 billion catties compared to last year, and this figure is almost equal to the total annual output in 1952. Second, and more importantly, this year there must be a more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Last year was the first year of the Great Leap Forward, and some projects have not yet been able to catch up. For example, transportation, power, and the production of certain daily consumer goods are still lagging behind the needs of development. Better arrangements must be made for these relatively weak links this year. Therefore, this year's tasks are far greater than last year's. This requires us to take twelve-part measures for various indicators to ensure their realization.

Among all the necessary measures, continuing to carry out mass movements on a large scale is a fundamental one. In the cause of socialist construction, it is possible and necessary to carry out vigorous mass movements. This is one of the basic experiences of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958. Therefore, all kinds of methods of mass movement that have been effective last year, such as the secretary taking the lead, the entire party mobilizing, conducting debates on targets and measures, leading cadres personally engaging in "experimental fields," convening on-site meetings, conducting inspections on time, visiting and comparing, launching red flag competitions, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" in industrial enterprises, must be adhered to this year, and continue to be developed and improved.

In order to seriously take sufficient measures, we must have the fullest drive. Therefore, to say "twenty-four-part drive" is to say that we must use double the effort to ensure the effective implementation of the twelve-part measures. Without this kind of drive, there would be no courage to stipulate twelve-part measures and implement them to the end, and there would be no courage to put forward ten-part targets. Without this kind of drive, there would be no vigorous mass movements, no leap forward, no bold creations, and no revolution. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party emphatically pointed out: "We must continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, go all out, and strive for the top. We must despise difficulties strategically, and this is an unwavering principle." If asked how the high speed of last year was created, we can answer without hesitation: This is primarily due to the soaring drive of the 600 million people led by the Party. Putting politics in command means first and foremost putting the drive in command. As the saying goes, "It all depends on human effort" and "Man will conquer nature." This "man" must first have enough drive. Without overwhelming heroic spirit, how can we create overwhelming heroic deeds?

Of course, the meaning of twenty-four-part drive is not to say that people should work for double the time. Drive and hard work both refer first and foremost to the incomparably high political enthusiasm of the people, the fearless spirit of despising difficulties, and the heroic spirit of hard work and perseverance. What Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Introducing a Cooperative" – "spirit uplifted, high in morale, full of vigor" – is a vivid portrayal of this twenty-four-part drive of the 600 million people of our country. Under this spiritual state, people devote themselves to selfless labor with double the effort, and sometimes even forget to eat and sleep in order to tackle an urgent task, unable to stop. This enthusiasm of the masses is valuable, but forgetting to eat and sleep cannot last. Therefore, we ask leaders at all levels to ensure that the people have sufficient rest time, and strive to improve work efficiency by reforming tools and improving labor organization. The purpose of our doing so is, of course, not to restrict the drive of the people, but on the contrary, to enable the people to maintain the fullest drive for a long time.

Similarly, the meaning of twenty-four-part drive is not to say that objective laws can be ignored and that one can rush around blindly. Our drive is to achieve those targets that can be achieved through effort, and it is used on those measures that are feasible. This kind of drive is a subjective initiative that conforms to objective laws. We oppose subjectivism, but we firmly advocate maximizing subjective initiative under conditions permitted by objective conditions.

Spring is warm and flowers are blooming, and the prelude to the Great Leap Forward in 1959 has also begun. The tasks are arduous, but because of the victorious foundation and rich experience of last year, the conditions are more favorable than last year. In such a situation, a calm mind is necessary, and a high degree of enthusiasm is also necessary. Therefore, "Ten-part targets, twelve-part measures, twenty-four-part drive" is still a timely and appropriate fighting slogan for the people of the whole country. We should enable this fighting slogan to play a greater positive role among the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the country!

    十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲
    “红旗”杂志一九五九年第三期社论
    去年春天，江苏省常熟县提出一个响亮的口号：“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”。这个口号很快就风行全国，成为广大群众喜闻乐见的战斗口号，对于1958年的工农业大跃进起了积极作用。今年是苦战三年有决定意义的一年，一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进的任务摆在我们面前。各地人民群众在工业战线上，正在为今年完成一千八百万吨钢、三亿八千万吨煤和其他一系列的生产和基本建设的计划而奋斗，在目前首先要努力完成第一季度的计划；在农业战线上，正在为今年生产一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担棉花、六百万吨食用植物油、二千万担麻和实现全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所通过的十大倡议而奋斗，在目前首先是突击积肥造肥和加紧冬季作物管理。在这个更加壮阔的生产高潮正在来临的时节，继续提倡“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”这样一个生动有力的口号，是完全必要的。
    所谓十分指标，就是在可能范围内的最高的指标。对于高指标，广大的干部和群众已经有了坚定的信念，因为去年大跃进的实践已经证明，党所规定的高指标是大胆的，但又是实事求是的，因而只要人们做了足够的努力，是完全能够实现的。实事求是，并不意味着面向过去，一次又一次地重复已经发生的事实，而是立足在已经达到的水平上，高瞻远瞩，面向将来，把指标插在经过努力可以达到的最高限度。今年的一千八百万吨钢，三亿八千万吨煤，一万零五百亿斤粮食，一亿担棉花等指标，没有一项不是指向今年所能达到的最高点的。很显然，全国的高指标必须有地方的高指标作基础。因此，各地在制订年度计划的时候，必须立足在现实的基础上，充分估计一切可以调动的有利因素，把指标定在“十分”的水平上面。当然，指标并不是可以任意地无限地提高。十分，就是它的一般的限度。我们并不主张硬要提出十一分、十二分指标，因为那样的指标不是可靠的，有时甚至是不可能实现的。提出过高的、使群众无法实现的指标，结果会伤害群众的情绪和信心。但是如果借口稳妥可靠，不提出经过努力可以实现的十分指标，而是提出八分、九分指标，这就必然使企图向少慢差费倒退的保守派、观潮派感到高兴，而损伤大多数群众多快好省地建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，必然会妨碍1959年的跃进计划的完成。毫无疑问，我们必须坚决防止和纠正这种倾向，为坚持十分指标的原则而斗争。
    我们不提倡十二分指标，但是我们却坚决要求十二分措施。为什么呢？定出一个高指标，究竟不算太困难；而要实现这个指标，却需要极大的努力。而且实际生活的发展，总比人们的预料复杂得多。拟定指标的时候，不可能完全洞察整个过程的一切细节。因此，在实践过程中，常常会遇到一些原来没有预计到的这样或那样的困难和周折。要求十二分措施，正是我们共产党人战术上重视困难的具体表现。它可以使我们比较有把握地立于不败之地。对任何事情，从最困难处着想，并不会使我们遭到什么损失，倒可以推动我们更周密地安排各项工作。即令困难比预料的多了两分，我们的措施也多了两分，可以同它相抵。如果并没有发生那样严重的困难，由于我们采取了十二分措施，结果达到了十二分指标，取得了更大的胜利，当然就更好了。
    今年在全国说来，有些产品的增长速度好像没有去年高，但是实际任务却更艰巨了。这是因为，第一，基数大了，有些指标虽然看起来没有去年增长的快，但增长的绝对数字却很大。比如钢产量比去年增加七百万吨左右，这个数字比1957年的全年总产量还要多出一百多万吨。粮食比去年增加三千亿斤左右，这个数字也几乎等于1952年的全年总产量。第二，更重要的是，今年要有一个更全面的大跃进。去年是大跃进的第一年，有一些项目还没有能赶上来，比如交通运输、电力和某些日用消费品的生产还落后于发展的需要，对于这些比较薄弱的环节，在今年必须作更好的安排。所以今年的任务大大超过去年。这就更加要求我们对于各项指标采取十二分措施来保证实现。
    在各项必要的措施中间，继续大搞群众运动是基本的一项。在社会主义建设事业中，可以开展而且必须开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，这是1958年工农业大跃进的基本经验之一。因此，凡是去年已经行之有效的群众运动的各种办法，例如书记挂帅、全党动员，对于指标和措施进行鸣放辩论，领导干部亲自搞“试验田”，召集现场会议，按时检查，参观评比，展开红旗竞赛，抓两头、带中间，以及工业企业中的“两参、一改、三结合”等等方法，今年都必须坚持下去，并且继续加以发展和提高。
    为了认真采取充分的措施，必须有最饱满的干劲。所以说“二十四分干劲”，就是说要用双倍的努力去确保十二分措施的有效的执行。没有这种干劲，就不会有魄力去规定十二分措施，并且贯彻执行到底，也不会有胆量提出十分指标。没有这种干劲，就不会有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，不会有任何跃进，任何大胆的创造，任何革命。因此，党的八届六中全会着重指出：“我们一定要继续反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定要在战略上藐视困难，这是坚定不移的方针。”要问去年的高速度是怎样造成的？我们可以毫不犹豫地回答：这首先是由于党所领导的六亿人民的冲天干劲。政治挂帅，首先就是挂干劲的帅。常言道：“事在人为”、“人定胜天”。这个“人”首先就得有足够的干劲。如果没有排山倒海的英雄气概，怎么能做出排山倒海的英雄事迹？
    当然，二十四分干劲的意思并不是说，人们要用双倍的时间去劳动。干劲也好，苦战也好，首先是指人们那种无比高涨的政治热情，藐视困难的无畏精神，艰苦卓绝的英雄气概。毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”里所说的“精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”，正是我国六亿人民这种二十四分干劲的生动写照。在这种精神状态下面，人们用双倍的努力进行忘我的劳动，甚至有时为了突击一个紧急任务而废寝忘餐，欲罢不能。群众的这种热情是可贵的，但是废寝忘餐却不能持久。所以我们要求各级领导者保证人民群众有足够的休息时间，并且努力用改革工具和改善劳动组织的办法来提高工效。我们这样做的目的，当然不是为了限制人民群众的干劲，相反，正是为了使人民群众能够在长时间内保持最充分的干劲。
    同样，二十四分干劲的意思也不是说，可以无视客观规律，横冲直撞。我们的干劲是为了实现那经过努力可以实现的指标，而且是用在那切实可行的措施上面的。这种干劲是一种符合客观规律的主观能动性。我们反对主观主义，但是却坚决主张在客观条件许可的情况下，最大限度地发挥主观能动作用。
    春暖花开，1959年大跃进的序幕也已经揭开。任务是艰巨的，但是由于有了去年的胜利基础和丰富经验，条件也就比去年更有利。在这样一个形势下，冷静的头脑是必要的，高度的热情也是必要的。所以“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”，仍然是全国人民的切合时宜的战斗口号。我们应该使这个战斗口号，在全国的广大的干部和群众当中，发挥出更大的积极作用！
