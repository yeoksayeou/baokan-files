    Raise the Red Flag Even Higher
    Xinyu
    In the endeavor for a new, greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, people are finding the experiences of advanced units that achieved brilliant victories in 1958 increasingly valuable. People have given these advanced units a collective name: "Red Flags of 1958." What a resounding name! The red flag—a term everyone loves to hear—radiates a sun-like brilliance in people's minds. It has become synonymous with victory, advancement, role model, and so on.
    People's high regard for last year's advanced experiences is understandable. "Human knowledge originates from practice." People always draw useful experiences from historical practice and seek the path forward; they also ignite new hopes and ideals on the basis of the victories already achieved. Once a path is found and an ideal is generated, it immediately produces tremendous power, enabling people to forge ahead with full confidence to seize new and greater victories. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 not only led our people to a broad road of building socialism at high speed, but also inspired the people of the whole country, on the basis of this great victory, to generate even greater ideals and firm beliefs in striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Cherishing these experiences and applying them in practical work will enable us to "not only continue to leap forward in 1959, but also leap forward even better."
    There are thousands of red flags, each with its own characteristics, and each red flag contains rich experience. Take the red flag of the CCP Dangyang County Committee of Hubei Province, which achieved an average yield of 800 jin of ginned cotton per mu on a hundred mu cotton field, as introduced in this newspaper on February 4th. This is a red flag of high yield over a large area, but it is not just a general high yield over a large area. Rather, it is a red flag of cadres cultivating experimental plots, launching mass movements, and using experimental plots to drive large-scale high yields. It is precisely because of these characteristics that this red flag is more vivid and attracts more attention. How much useful experience and how many thought-provoking questions are contained in the red flag of the CCP Dangyang County Committee's cultivation of experimental plots! The comrades of the Dangyang County Committee did not choose fertile land with good natural conditions to conduct experimental plots, but insisted on conducting high-yield experiments in "historically well-known low-yield areas." What a precious revolutionary style of daring to think and dare to act! Their revolutionary style of daring to think and dare to act is not unfounded conjecture and blind action, but is built on the scientific basis of specific analysis of specific situations, and on the basis of the spirit of hard work and diligent labor to change barren land. They not only strategically despise all difficulties, but also tactically treat difficulties seriously, even testing a specific technical measure in a three-mu "central experimental field" before推广推广 it to all experimental fields and the entire county. In their work, they did not passively adapt to objective conditions, but actively changed unfavorable conditions and created favorable conditions, turning the stony dams that "spent a year's hard work and sweat, but it was difficult to grow good crops in the fields" into fertile farmland by "cutting high and filling low." In the entire process of striving for high yields, the comrades of the Dangyang County Committee not only excellently played the leading role of cadres, bringing advanced ideas and advanced targets to the broad masses, but also more earnestly mobilized and relied on the masses, using the method of launching mass movements to achieve these advanced ideas and advanced targets—it is not necessary to list more of their facts to fully illustrate that the red flag of the Dangyang County Committee contains such rich experience.
    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, many red flags emerged in various places and on all fronts. Learning from the red flag units, making the experience of the red flag units the wealth of the people of the whole country, and applying these successful experiences to our own work will undoubtedly have a profound impact on our efforts to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959. Let us raise the victorious red flag of 1958 even higher, even higher.

    把红旗举得再高些
    新宇
    在争取新的更大更好更全面的跃进中，人们对1958年获得了辉煌胜利的先进单位的经验，是越来越珍贵了。人们给这些先进单位起了一个总的名字：“1958年的红旗”。多么响亮的名字！红旗——这个人人喜闻乐见的字眼，在人们的心目中放射着朝阳般的光辉。它已经同胜利、先进、榜样等等名词变成同样的涵义了。
    人们如此珍贵去年的先进经验是可以理解的。“人的认识来源于实践”。人们总是在历史的实践中吸取有益的经验，寻找前进的道路；也总是在已经取得的胜利的基础上燃烧起新的希望、新的理想。道路一经找出，理想一旦产生，便会立即产生巨大的力量，使人信心百倍、勇往直前地去夺取新的更大的胜利。1958年的大跃进，不仅使我国人民找到了一条高速度建设社会主义的康庄大道，而且也使全国人民在这个伟大胜利的基础上，产生了争取更大更好更全面跃进的更加伟大的理想和坚强的信念。珍贵这些经验，并在实际工作中运用这些经验，就会使我们“不但有可能在1959年继续跃进，并且有可能跃进得更好”。
    红旗千万面，面面有特点，每一面红旗都包涵着丰富的经验。以本报2月4日介绍的中共湖北当阳县委百亩棉田获得平均八百斤皮棉这面红旗为例，这是一面大面积高产的红旗，但又不是一般的大面积高产，而是一面干部种试验田、大搞群众运动，用试验田带动大面积丰产的红旗。正因为有了这些特点，就使得这面红旗更鲜艳更引人注目。中共当阳县委种试验田这面红旗里面包涵着多少有益的经验，多少值得人们深思的问题啊。当阳县委会的同志们不在土壤肥沃、自然条件良好的土地上去搞试验田，偏偏要在“历史上有名的低产区”进行丰产试验。这是多么宝贵的敢想敢干的革命风格！他们这种敢想敢干的革命风格不是无根据的瞎想蛮干，而是建筑在对具体情况的具体分析的科学基础之上，建筑在踏踏实实的用辛勤劳动改变瘠薄土地的苦干精神基础之上的。他们不仅在战略上藐视一切困难，而且在战术上又认真对待困难，甚至连一个具体的技术措施，也要先在三亩“中心试验田”里试验成功后，再向全部试验田、向全县推广。他们在工作中不是消极地去适应客观条件，而是积极地去改变不利条件，创造有利条件，把“一年辛苦汗流尽，田里难长好庄稼”的石坝子“削高填凹”变成肥沃的良田。在争取高额丰产的全部过程中，当阳县委会的同志们不仅出色地发挥了干部的领导作用，把先进思想、先进指标带给了广大群众，而且更认真地发动群众、依靠群众，用大搞群众运动的方法去实现这些先进的思想、先进的指标——不必更多地列举他们的事实就已经能够充分说明：当阳县委这面红旗里有着多么丰富的经验。
    1958年大跃进中，各个地方、各条战线上都出现了很多红旗。向红旗单位学习，使红旗单位的经验成为全国人民的财富，并把这些成功的经验运用到自己的工作中去，无疑会对我们争取1959年的更大跃进发生深刻的影响，让我们把1958年的胜利红旗举得再高些，再高些。
