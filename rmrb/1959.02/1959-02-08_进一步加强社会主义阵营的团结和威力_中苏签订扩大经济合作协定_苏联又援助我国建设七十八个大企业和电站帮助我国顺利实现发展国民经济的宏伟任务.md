Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 7th. Negotiations on further expanding economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

In accordance with the agreement between the two parties, the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union held negotiations in Moscow on further expanding economic and technical cooperation between the two countries.

The negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and full understanding. During the negotiations, the two sides extensively and comprehensively exchanged views on economic issues of common concern.

The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union believe that further expanding economic and technical cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will help smoothly realize the grand task of the People's Republic of China in developing the national economy, and will further strengthen the unity and power of the socialist camp.

After successful negotiations, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, signed an agreement in Moscow on February 7, 1959, on cooperation between the two countries for the construction of seventy-eight large industrial enterprises and power stations in China between 1959 and 1967 in the fields of metallurgy, chemicals, coal, petroleum, machine manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, radio technology, and building materials. This new agreement supplements existing agreements on Soviet technical assistance to China in implementing industrialization.

The agreement stipulates that Soviet agencies will conduct research and design work based on the latest Soviet scientific and technological achievements, supply equipment, instruments, and certain specialized materials, dispatch the necessary number of Soviet experts to provide technical assistance in the construction, installation, adjustment, and commissioning of enterprises, and accept Chinese experts and workers to conduct production technology internships in corresponding Soviet enterprises.

In view of the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in developing the national economy, especially in developing the machine manufacturing industry and training its own skilled engineering and technical personnel, the Chinese side will independently create most of the supporting equipment required by the enterprises stipulated in the agreement and will undertake the survey and design work for some of the above-mentioned enterprises.

As with past agreements, this agreement also stipulates that the Soviet side will grant the People's Republic of China, free of charge, the production licenses for the products manufactured by these enterprises, and provide the necessary technical data so that the People's Republic of China can organize the production and manufacture of the supporting equipment required by the enterprises stipulated in the agreement.

The total value of equipment, designs, and other technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union under the agreement is approximately five billion rubles. The Chinese side will supply goods to the Soviet Union in accordance with the existing Sino-Soviet trade agreement to pay for the equipment and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union.

The Chinese side participating in the signing ceremony included: Kang Sheng, Li Xuefeng, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, Gu Zhuoxin, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, Li Zheren, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Zhang Weilie, Zhang Huadong, Li Zewang, and other personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet side included: Mikoyan, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Suslov, Aristov, Kosygin, Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, Minister Kabanov, Patolichev, Minister of Foreign Trade, Skachkov, Chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, Kuznetsov, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andropov, Minister of the CPSU Central Committee, Yudin, Soviet Ambassador to China, Arkhipov, Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, Zimyanin, Director of the Far East Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other personnel.

The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union believe that this agreement is a new and important link in further strengthening and expanding effective, mutually beneficial economic cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance between the two socialist countries.
