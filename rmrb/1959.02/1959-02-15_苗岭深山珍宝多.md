Many Treasures in the Deep Mountains of Miaoling

    "Eighteen Fir"
    Many provinces in China produce fir trees, but when it comes to the quality of fir wood, the "Eighteen Fir" cultivated by the Miao and Dong farmers in the Qingshui River basin of Southeastern Guizhou is the most famous.
    This artificially cultivated fir tree grows quickly, generally maturing in about eighteen years, commonly known as "Eighteen Fir." In Jinping County, fir trees have even been found to meet national felling standards in eight years. "Eighteen Fir" is tall, straight, strong, light, and resilient, with the thickness of the trunk at the neck and root being similar. The biggest advantage is that as the fir wood ages, it gradually decays from the outer layer to the heart, so even if the outer layer rots, the heartwood remains solid.
    Due to these valuable characteristics, many provinces and cities across the country come to Southeastern Guizhou every year to transport "Eighteen Fir" from the Qingshui River.

    Silver Ear Fungus
    Many people know that Sichuan produces silver ear fungus, but few know that Guizhou also produces it. Southeastern Guizhou is one of the silver ear fungus producing areas in Guizhou. In Huangping, Shibing and other counties in Southeastern Guizhou, "growing fungus" is a relatively common rural sideline. In 1955, the year with the highest silver ear fungus production in the state, production reached 4,500 jin, ten times the production before liberation.
    Silver ear fungus, also known as white fungus, grows on oak trees, contains a lot of gelatin, is a high-grade non-staple food, and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine as a treasure for nourishing blood, brain, and stomach.

    Litsea Cubeba
    In the deep mountains of the southern part of the autonomous prefecture, where the climate is relatively warm, grows a Litsea tree with narrow leaves and a height of about ten feet. It blooms with yellow flowers in the spring and bears fruit at the end of spring. After the Litsea Cubeba matures in the summer, the local Dong and Miao farmers use it in their dishes as a seasoning, almost as important as chili peppers and salt. In the past two or three years, people have discovered that Litsea Cubeba is a raw material for high-grade aromatic oil, and have begun to further utilize it.
    Litsea Cubeba, also known as cubeb, mujiangzi, shanjiao, and xianggui, contains citral, which is the main raw material for producing various violet ketones with a fragrance similar to ionone, and is also the main raw material for synthesizing vitamin A. Every hundred jin of fruit can be distilled into four to six jin of Litsea Cubeba oil.

    苗岭深山珍宝多 
    “十八杉”
    全国许多省份产杉树，但是论起杉木的质量，黔东南清水江流域苗族、侗族林农培植的“十八杉”却是最有名的。
    这种人工培育的杉树成长快，一般在十八年左右就成材，通称“十八杉”。锦屏县还发现八年就达到国家砍伐标准的杉树。“十八杉”身高、笔直、干壮、量轻、有韧性，树干颈部和根部的粗细相差不多。最大的优点是杉木在年长日久后，只由表皮向内心逐渐腐朽，即便外层烂了，木心依然坚实。
    由于这些可贵的特点，每年全国不少省市都到黔东南调运清水江的“十八杉”。
    银　耳
    许多人都知道四川出产银耳，岂不知贵州也出产银耳。黔东南就是贵州银耳的产区之一。在黔东南的黄平、施秉等县，“放耳子”是比较普遍的农村副业。全州银耳产量最高的1955年，达到四千五百斤，相当解放前产量的十倍。
    银耳又叫白木耳，是青杠木上生长出来的，含胶质较多，是高级副食品，中医又用它作为补血健脑健胃的珍品。
    山　苍　子
    在自治州南部气候比较温热的深山里，生长着一种叶子狭长、高约一丈的山苍树。它在春季开黄花，春末结实。夏季山苍子成熟后，当地的侗族、苗族农民用来放在菜里，当调味料，几乎和辣椒、盐同等重要。最近两三年来，人们发现山苍子原是一种高级芳香油的原料，便开始进一步利用起来。
    山苍子又称毕澄茄子、木浆子、山椒、香桂等，含柠檬醛，是制香堇型香味的各种紫罗兰酮的主要原料，也是合成维生素甲的主要原料。每百斤果实可蒸馏出山苍子油四至六斤。
