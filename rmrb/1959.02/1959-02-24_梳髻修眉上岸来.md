　　Coiffed Hair and Trimmed Eyebrows Come Ashore
　　Wu Lai

　　I went to the bank of the Pearl River and crossed the small wooden bridges lined with flower trees—the floating streets—to visit some acquaintances who live on the water. What particularly caught my attention was the increasing number of small boats with small bamboo cages hanging on bamboo poles. Friends, do you know what this means? Let me tell you, these small boats are for sale! However, unlike in the old society, this is not a sign of the water dwellers' bankruptcy, but a sign that they are bidding farewell to the life of "floating homes" they have lived for thousands of years!

　　These days, their lives are changing as rapidly as the rushing river: housewives have stepped out of their small boats; children have taken off the gourds on their backs and loosened the ropes around their bodies, jumping and playing like birds released from a cage in nurseries; young fishermen have learned to be blacksmiths; young women rowing boats have become steel furnace foremen; relief recipients have entered nursing homes, and public canteens are filled with customers...

　　Naturally, all of this cannot compare to the importance of the great relocation. Whenever this matter is mentioned, people become elated, their eyes light up, and their faces turn red. One family wants to find a house, another wants to buy furniture, and they talk endlessly. An eighty-year-old man smiled at me and said, "I've been lucky enough to catch up with this great joyous event, so I haven't lived in vain." A mother surrounded by her children hummed two lines of dialect poetry to express her feelings. The lines were: "It's good to eat congee with salt and go ashore, to close the door against wind and rain." The poetry is simple, but the emotion is deep. Every year, when the typhoon signal is raised between summer and autumn, their hearts are also raised. Even on ordinary days, some children would drown by the boat with ropes tied to them. Thinking of this situation, mothers couldn't sleep well. How much they longed to come ashore and live a stable life!

　　The origins of the water dwellers are not all the same. Some were driven to the water to escape the oppression of rulers during the feudal era. In the past, they were not allowed to go ashore, participate in imperial examinations, or marry land dwellers. During the reactionary rule, they were subjected to layers of persecution and exploitation by pier owners, fake traffic police, and "thieves," and they never dreamed of being able to settle ashore. They didn't even dare to go to the pier much, because it was often a place where hooligans and gangsters committed evil deeds. A woman said: Before liberation, she grew to fifteen or sixteen years old and had never dared to walk on the Haizhu Bridge, even though their boat had passed under the Haizhu Bridge thousands of times. Now, these nightmare-like past events have disappeared with the river. The water dwellers can not only run to the shore, but also move to the shore.

　　New-style residences are scattered in Ersha Tou, Ruyi Fang, Henan Xiaogang and other places. Among them are the fishermen's new village, the residents' new village, and the workers' dormitories. Many people have already moved into their new homes. Some people put up a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao on the snow-white walls, expressing their deep respect. Some people put a vase of flowers on the table, enjoying a new life as fragrant and beautiful as flowers. Especially during this Spring Festival, people's enthusiasm is even stronger. Whether passing through those green water streets or walking in front of their new homes on the shore, a scene of fervent jubilation can be seen everywhere. Look, here is a group of women with large, high buns and facial hair removed, each with their buns combed big and smooth, and their eyebrows trimmed thin, long, and curved; there is a group of adults and children laughing and rejoicing to their hearts' content. In previous years, water dwellers worshiped gods a lot around the Spring Festival, but now the situation has changed greatly. I remember the last time I visited them, it was the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, which is the day when the "Kitchen God" ascends to heaven according to legend. According to the old custom, every household had to cook sugary糍粑 to send off the god, which was quite lively. But on that day this year, the Kitchen God had already been sent to heaven long ago, and had disappeared without a trace. Many families have donated their ancestral bronze incense burners and tin candlesticks when donating scrap copper and iron. Those who used to worship the Golden Flower Bodhisattva, the Guanyin Bodhisattva, and the Dragon Mother Goddess, are now coming out of the mire of superstition.

　　In the Henan Xiaogang New Village, in a newly built workers' dormitory, I visited a water dweller's family who had recently come ashore. They lived in a spacious room, and the winter sun shone through the bright glass windows, making the whole house feel bright and warm. Outside the window was an open space, and children were somersaulting outside, with bursts of innocent laughter from time to time. The old grandmother was cooking and preparing meals in the kitchen. The house was equipped with electric lights, running water, and a flush toilet. Everywhere was dry, clean, and bright. The old grandmother and her grandchildren were all very satisfied. In their house, there were no longer shrines or ancestral tablets, but the certificates of merit for the old grandmother being selected as an advanced worker and a sanitation model. It turned out that this old grandmother was still an "old activist." Talking about worshiping gods, she told me an interesting little story: The old grandmother had joined street work early and was no longer superstitious. But her daughter-in-law still burned incense and worshiped her gods during the New Year and holidays. There is freedom of belief, so the mother-in-law did not interfere with the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law did not interfere with the mother-in-law. But after going ashore, the daughter-in-law also made progress after participating in work. Speaking of this, the old grandmother laughed heartily and said: "We used to worship gods for decades, how could we worship such a good life! Hahaha..."

　　Is this the laughter of an old woman? No, this is the laughter of many people, many families. In another corner of the city—the Ersha Tou Fishermen's New Village—I also heard the same joyous laughter from a fisherman.

　　This fisherman was forty-five years old last year, and had lived on the water for forty-four years. Counting up from himself, his father and grandfather had taken boats as their home for five generations, drifting east and west like duckweed. Now, everything has changed. He lives in a room in the Fishermen's New Village, facing north and south, with a gentle breeze. In front of the house is a large open space, and in the house are newly purchased chairs, tables, and utensils. Their lives and work are being cared for by the People's Government in every possible way. The child is also studying in middle school, becoming the most educated person in his family's ancestral generations. When he talked to me about these scenes, he could no longer suppress the happy laughter from the bottom of his heart.

　　From the water to the shore, although it is only a few feet away, the water dwellers have been walking for thousands of years and still could not touch the shore. Only under the radiance of the Party can they return to the solid ground after liberation and begin a prosperous and stable life.

    梳髻修眉上岸来
    吴莱
    我走到珠江江畔，跨过那一道道摆满花树的小木桥——水上街道，去看望一些相识的水上人家。特别引起我注意的，是越来越多的在竹竿上挂着个小竹笼的小艇。朋友，你知道这是什么意思吗？告诉你，这是小艇要出卖啦！然而，这决不像在旧社会那样是水上人家破产的标志，而是水上居民要和千百年来“浮家泛宅”的生活告别的标志呵！
    这些日子以来，他们的生活正像那股奔腾的江水一样起着一瞬千里的变化：家庭妇女走出了小艇；孩子解下背上的葫芦、松开了身上的绳索，像出笼的小鸟般在托儿所里蹦跳游戏；打鱼的小伙子学会打铁；划艇的大姑娘当了炼钢炉长；救济户进了敬老院，公共食堂上坐满了顾客……。
    自然，这一切都比不上大搬家这桩事情重要。一提起这桩事，人们就兴高采烈，眼睛发亮，面上喷红，这家要找房子，那户要购家具，谈个没有完。一个八十多岁的老头儿对我笑道：“赶上这桩大喜事，我总算没有白活了。”一个儿女绕膝的妈妈哼出两句方言诗句，表达自己的心情。那诗句是：“食粥点盐上街（即上岸）好，翻风落雨掩埋门。”诗句虽浅，感情却深。年年，夏秋之间挂起风球的时候，他们的心也就挂起来了。就是在平常日子，也会有一些孩童连着绳索淹死在艇边。一想到这种情形，做母亲的就再睡不着好觉。她们是多么渴望到岸上来过安定的日子啊！
    水上居民的来历，不可能完全相同。一部分是在封建时代反抗过统治者的压迫，被驱逐而流落到水上来的。过去，他们不准许上岸，不准参加科举考试，不准和陆上人通婚。反动派统治时，他们又受着码头主、伪交通警察和“贼公”的层层迫害、剥削，正所谓“上头怕交通、下头怕贼公”，做梦也没有想过能到岸上来定居。甚至连码头也不大敢上，因为那里经常是流氓、歹徒为非作恶的场所。一个妇女说：解放前，她长到十五、六岁了，还未敢到海珠桥上走过，虽则她们的船曾经千百次在海珠桥底下穿过。现在，这些噩梦似的往事已随着江水一去不复返了。水上人民不但可以跑到岸上来，而且还移居到岸上。
    一幢幢新型的住宅散布在二沙头、如意坊、河南小港等地方，这里面有渔民新村、居民新村、工属宿舍。不少人已经搬进新居了。有些人在雪白的粉墙上贴上一张彩色的毛主席画像，寄托着深沉的敬意。有些人在案桌上摆着一瓶花，享受着鲜花一样芬芳和美丽的新生活。特别在这个春节，人们的情趣就更浓厚了。不管打那些绿色的水上街道经过或打他们岸上的新居门前走过，到处可以看见一片热烈欢腾的气象。看吧，这里一堆是梳大髻、绞面毛的妇女，人人的发髻梳得又大又光滑，眉儿修得又细又长又弯；那里一群熙熙攘攘的尽情欢乐的大人、孩子。往年，水上人家在春节前后拜神特别多，可是现在情形大大地变了。记得上次我去拜访他们时，正是旧历腊月二十四，那是神话传说是“灶老爷”升天的日子，按旧例，家家要煮糖糍粑送神，有一番热闹的。可是那一天，今年这位灶老爷早就被送上了天，而且一去无踪了。许多人家在捐献废铜烂铁时，已把祖传的铜香炉、锡烛台都捐献了。那些过去拜金花菩萨，拜观音大士，拜龙母娘娘的人，现在纷纷从迷信的泥沼中走出来了。
    在河南小港新村，一幢新建成的工人宿舍里，我探望了一家上岸不久的水上人家。他们住着一间宽敞的大房间，冬日的阳光透过明亮的玻璃窗投射进来，满房子都感到光明、温暖。窗外是一片空地，孩子在外面翻跟斗，不时响起天真的笑声。老奶奶在厨房里烧菜、煮饭。房子安装着电灯、自来水、还有水厕。到处干爽、光洁。老奶奶和小孙孙们都过得很满意。在他们的屋子里，已看不到神龛和祖先神位了，有的就是老奶奶当选先进工作者和卫生模范的奖状。原来这位老奶奶还是个“老积极”呢。谈起拜神，她告诉了我一段有趣的小故事：老奶奶很早就参加了街坊工作，不迷信了。可是儿媳妇过年过节，照旧烧她的香，拜她的神。信仰自由嘛，婆婆不干涉媳妇，媳妇也不干涉婆婆。可是上了岸，媳妇参加工作后也进步起来了。谈到这里，老奶奶爽朗地笑起来说：“我们过去都拜了几十年的神了，哪里拜得出这样的好日子来呢！哈哈哈……”
    这是一个老妇人的笑声吗？不，这是许多人、许多个家庭的笑声。在这个城市的另一个角落——二沙头的渔民新村里，我也听过一个渔民同样欢乐的笑声。
    这个渔民去年四十五岁了，有四十四年是居住在水上的，从他自己往上数起，父、祖有五代以船上为家，像浮萍一样地东漂西泊。现在，一切改变了，他居住在渔民新村的一间房子里，座北朝南，清风徐来。屋子前面是广阔的空地，屋子里有新置的椅桌和用具。他们的生活和工作受到人民政府无微不至的关怀。孩子也念到中学了，成了他家祖宗世代以来最有文化的人。他向我谈起这些景象的时候，再也不能抑制那发自深心的幸福的笑声了。
    从水上到岸上，虽是几尺之遥，但是水上人民走了千百年还摸不到岸边。只有在党的光辉照耀下，他们才能在解放后回到了坚实的大地上，开始了繁荣、安定的生活。
