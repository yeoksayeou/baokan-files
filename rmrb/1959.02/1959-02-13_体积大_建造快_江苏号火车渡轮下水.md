Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 12th. Workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai completed the slipway construction of China's largest train ferry at the time in an astonishing twenty-nine days. On the afternoon of the 6th, the ferry was launched amidst cheers.

This train ferry, named "Jiangsu," was built to accommodate the construction of the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing double-track railway projects. It is 126.55 meters long, has a displacement of 5,100 tons, and can simultaneously carry eighteen 50-ton freight cars and nine 30-ton freight cars. Its slipway construction period was shortened by 276 days compared to the "Shanghai" train ferry, which was slightly smaller and built by the same factory last year.

Before building the ship, the workers of the shipyard's shipbuilding workshop held meetings of all sizes. Each work section and team put forward guarantees to ensure that the ferry would leave the factory as soon as possible to support the current busy railway transportation. During the days of ferry construction, the workers showed soaring enthusiasm. Those who were off work were reluctant to leave, and those who were on duty arrived early. They actively made suggestions, came up with ideas, and carried out technical innovations in a big way, thus greatly shortening the construction time of the slipway project.

    体积大　建造快
    江苏号火车渡轮下水
    新华社上海12日电　上海江南造船厂工人以二十九天的惊人速度完成了当前我国最大的一艘火车渡轮的船台工程。6日下午，渡轮在一片欢呼声中下水。
    这艘命名为“江苏号”的火车渡轮是适应津浦、沪宁复线工程的建设而建造的。船长一百二十六点五五公尺，排水量五千一百吨，能够同时载渡五十吨的货车十八节和三十吨的货车九节。它的船台建造期比这个厂去年建成的船体略小的“上海号”火车渡轮缩短了二百七十六天。
    建船之前，这个厂造船车间的职工举行了大大小小的集会。各工段、小组纷纷提出保证，要让渡轮早日出厂，支援当前繁忙的铁路运输。在渡轮建造的日子里，工人们表现了冲天的干劲，下班的不肯走，上班的提早到，他们积极提建议，想办法，大搞技术革新，因而大大缩短了船台工程的修造时间。
