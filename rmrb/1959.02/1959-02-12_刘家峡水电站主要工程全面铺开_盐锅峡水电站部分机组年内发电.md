The tens of thousands of workers at the Liujiaxia Hydropower Engineering Bureau are overcoming various difficulties and rapidly advancing the grand projects of the Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia hydropower stations.

The workers at Liujiaxia Hydropower Station are striving to break through three barriers during the first dry season of this year: completing the diversion tunnel, damming the river, and excavating the dam foundation pit. The Yanguoxia Hydropower Station is striving to have some of its generating units start generating electricity within this year. The construction preparation time for these two hydropower stations was relatively short, and the materials and equipment prepared were insufficient. Under these circumstances, the Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau deeply mobilized the masses, launched a vigorous technical revolution, and adopted a combination of indigenous and modern methods for construction. For example, the cofferdam at Yanguoxia was originally designed as a wooden cage trestle bridge with earth and stone cofferdam, requiring 2,700 cubic meters of wood, 3,000 cubic meters of stone, and 2,420 cubic meters of gravel, which was not only costly but also difficult to obtain wood in a short time. After the leadership of the Engineering Bureau mobilized the masses to study, they adopted the commonly used folk method of grass and soil cofferdam, which was completed in only twenty days. The diversion tunnel of Liujiaxia Hydropower Station is 675 meters long and 14 meters in diameter, one of the few large tunnels in the world. To complete it in five months, highly mechanized construction is generally required. However, the stone team responsible for the tunnel construction at that time had very little machinery, so they found ways to use manual labor to assist the machinery. All open-cut sections of each tunnel were excavated manually. In order to save time, several branch tunnels were opened to increase the working face. When ventilation equipment was insufficient, pilot tunnels were first dug, and then expanded and lined. When there was no high-speed winch, winches from cars and water pump motors were used instead.

Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and their active research into technology, the two hydropower stations have achieved great results in the four months since construction began. At the beginning of construction, the average excavation of earth was only four or five cubic meters per worker per day, the average excavation of rock was only slightly more than one cubic meter per worker per day, and the daily progress of the pilot tunnel for the diversion tunnel was only more than three meters. Now, some detachments have achieved an average of more than 200 cubic meters of earth excavation per worker per day, and the daily progress of the tunnel pilot has increased to more than six meters. The main projects of Liujiaxia Hydropower Station have been fully unfolded. The pilot tunnel of the diversion tunnel was completely opened on New Year's Day, and the high dam slope cutting, concrete dam and main dam excavation, and spillway excavation are all being carried out intensively. As of the end of last year, the entire construction site had completed more than 2.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone, greatly exceeding the plan. The Yanguoxia Hydropower Station has successfully passed the cofferdam on the right bank, and is now carrying out the foundation pit excavation in full swing, and the first phase of concrete works has also begun to be poured.

    刘家峡水电站主要工程全面铺开
    盐锅峡水电站部分机组年内发电
    本报讯　刘家峡水力发电工程局的几万名职工，克服各种困难，把刘家峡和盐锅峡两大水电站的宏伟工程飞快地推向前进。
    刘家峡水电站职工正努力争取在今年第一个枯水季节打通三道关——修通导流隧洞，截流，开挖大坝基坑。盐锅峡水电站争取在今年内使部分机组开始发电。这两个水电站施工准备时间较短，准备的材料、设备不充分。在这种情况下，工程局党委深入发动群众，大闹技术革命，采取土洋并举的办法施工。如盐锅峡的围堰，原设计是木笼栈桥筑土石围堰，需要木材二千七百立方，石块三千方，砂砾二千四百二十方，不但造价高，而且一时不易弄到木材。经过工程局领导方面发动群众研究，采用民间常用的草土围堰，只用二十天的时间就修筑成功。刘家峡水电站导流隧洞，长六百七十五公尺，直径十四公尺，是世界上不多的大隧洞，要在五个月内修通，一般都要采取高度机械化施工。可是，当时担任隧洞施工的石方队机械很少，他们就想法用人工辅助机械。各洞明挖部分都用人力开挖；为了争取时间，就多开几个支洞，以增加工作面；通风设备不足，就先打通导洞，以后再扩大、衬砌。没有高速度卷扬机，就用汽车上的绞车加水泵马达来代替。
    由于职工们干劲冲天，积极钻研技术，两个水电站开工四个月来，获得了巨大的成就。开工初期，挖土方平均每工只四、五方，挖石方平均每工只一方多，导流隧洞导坑日进仅三公尺多。现在，有的分队挖土方平均达到每工二百多方，隧洞导坑日进尺提高到六尺以上。刘家峡水电站的各主要工程已经全面铺开。导流隧洞导坑在元旦全部打通，高坝劈坡、混凝土坝和主坝开挖、溢泄道开挖等，都在加紧进行。截至去年年底，全工地共完成土石方二百五十万多方，大大超过了计划。盐锅峡水电站已经顺利地渡过右岸的围堰关，现在正紧张地进行基坑开挖，第一期混凝土工程也已开始浇注。
