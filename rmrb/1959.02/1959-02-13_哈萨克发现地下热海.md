Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: TASS reported on the 10th that two wells on the bank of the Ili River in Kazakhstan, near the Chinese border, are gushing hot water. The temperature of these hot water fountains ranges from 52 to 96 degrees Celsius, with a daily flow of 6,000 cubic meters.

Chakabayev, a staff member of the Geological Institute of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences, told TASS reporters that an underground hot sea with a very low degree of mineralization has been discovered in the eastern part of the Ili Basin. The hot water stored in it is almost inexhaustible and can be used to provide heating for Almaty, as well as for greenhouse operations on state farms and collective farms.

    哈萨克发现地下热海
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社10日报道：在苏联哈萨克伊犁河岸、靠近中国边境的地方有两处钻井喷出热水。这些热水喷泉的水温在五十二度到九十六度之间，每昼夜的涌水量达六千立方公尺。
    哈萨克共和国科学院地质研究所工作人员恰卡巴耶夫对塔斯社记者说，在伊犁盆地的东部发现了矿化程度很弱的地下热海，它所储存的热水几乎是用不尽的，这些热水可用来使阿拉木图暖气化，和用于国营农场、集体农庄的温室作业。
