This newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch on the 10th: "Before the spring grass turns green, the seedlings are already green." While people are celebrating the Spring Festival, the first batch of early rice seeds sown by Guangdong farmers before the Beginning of Spring, breaking seasonal restrictions, has grown vigorously. Encouraged by this victory, farmers throughout the province are now busy harrowing fields and preparing the land with full confidence, continuing to sow the second and third batches of seeds.

Early sowing and early transplanting are revolutionary measures taken by Guangdong farmers to change the low-yield situation of early rice in Guangdong. In the past, early rice in Guangdong was generally sown at the Beginning of the Insects, transplanted at the Pure Brightness, and harvested at the Minor Heat. The growing period was generally only about 120 days. Moreover, when the grains were filling, it often coincided with the "Dragon Boat Water" torrential rain season, which easily caused lodging in the early stage and many unfilled grains, resulting in low yields. Last year, some places sowed early before the Rain Water, transplanted before the Spring Equinox, and harvested before the Summer Solstice. As a result, they avoided the "Dragon Boat Water" and obtained high yields. For example, the Miaobei Agricultural Cooperative in the Shatian area of Panyu County used to suffer from severe lodging of early rice and very low yields. Last year, because of early sowing, early transplanting, and early harvesting, the yield per mu reached more than 600 jin. This experience greatly encouraged farmers' confidence in sowing and transplanting early this year.

The reason why Guangdong can universally sow two seasons earlier this year is because it has overcome the water conservancy barrier and the technical barrier of early sowing. Guangdong's agricultural proverb says, "Nine out of ten early plantings are good." Farmers originally knew that early planting and early harvesting were good. However, in the past, because the water conservancy barrier or the technical barrier of early sowing had not been overcome, it was impossible or they dared not advance. In the past, when relying on the sky for food, Guangdong generally did not have water for farming until the Pure Brightness, so it was impossible to plant early even if they wanted to. Now, more than 20 million mu of basic farmland for rice in the province are irrigated by water conservancy projects. They can farm the land whenever they want. This is a material basis for realizing early planting. Secondly, early planting requires early sowing, but in the past, early sown seeds and seedlings were often damaged by frost and snow, so it was impossible to plant early even if they wanted to. However, last year, this technical barrier also began to be overcome. Various regions have gained some successful experiences in early sowing through experiments. In particular, Lianshan County, a mountainous area in northern Guangdong with the lowest temperature, successfully created the experience of raising seedlings during the frost period, which further strengthened people's confidence in realizing early sowing and early planting, laying a technical foundation for this year's early sowing.

When universally promoting early sowing this year, Guangdong still adopted the method of leading cadres and demonstration at all levels. The county party committees and commune party committees generally conducted trial sowings before the Great Cold, and then held on-site meetings. Through debate and dissemination of technology, the experience of trial sowings was promoted, so the quality of sowing was generally good.

### 华南地区报春早  春草未绿秧先绿  广东稻种播得早长得好

    华南地区报春早   春草未绿秧先绿
    广东稻种播得早长得好
    本报广州10日电　“春草未绿秧先绿”，当人们正在欢度春节的时候，广东农民打破季节限制提早在立春前播下的第一批早稻种子，已茁壮地成长起来。在这个胜利鼓舞下，全省农民现正满怀信心地忙着耙田整地，继续把第二批、第三批种子播下去。
    早播、早插，这是广东农民为了改变广东早稻低产面貌而采取的一项革命措施。广东过去种早稻，一般是惊蛰开始播种，清明开始插秧，小暑开始收割，生长期一般只有一百二十天左右，而且灌浆时，往往碰上“龙舟水”这个暴雨季节，容易造成前期倒伏和不实粒多，因而产量不高。去年有些地方提早在雨水前播种，春分前插秧，夏至前收割；结果避过“龙舟水”而获得高产。如原来番禺县沙田地区的庙背农业社，早稻一向倒伏严重，产量很低，去年因为早播、早插、早收，结果亩产量达到六百多斤。这个经验，大大鼓舞了农民今年提早播种、提早插秧的信心。
    广东今年所以能够全省普遍提早两个季节播种，是因为已经攻克了水利关和早播的技术关。广东农谚说，“十年早有九拾好”，农民原来也知道早种、早收是好的。但过去因水利关或早播的技术关未过，所以不能提早或不敢提早。在过去靠天吃饭的情况下，广东一般要到清明才有水办田，因此想早种也不可能。现在，全省二千多万亩水稻基本农田，都有水利工程灌溉，要什么时候办田就什么时候办田。这是实现早种的一个物质基础。其次，早种就要早播，但过去早播的种子和秧苗往往被霜雪冻坏，因此想要早种也不可能。但去年，这个技术关也开始被攻克了。各个地区都通过试验取得了一些成功的早播经验，特别是气温最低的粤北山区连山县创造成功了霜期育秧的经验，更加坚定了人们实现早播、早种的信心，为今年的早播打下了技术基础。
    广东今年在普遍推广早播的时候，仍然采取了干部带头、层层示范的方法。各县县委和公社党委普遍在大寒之前就进行试播，然后召开现场会议，通过辩论、传播技术把试播的经验推广，因此播种的质量一般都比较良好。
