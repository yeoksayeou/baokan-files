Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch: Haitian exiles have recently protested against the U.S. government's vigorous support for the pro-American François Duvalier government in Haiti. According to the "New York Times," an organization called the "Haitian Revolutionary Front" wrote a letter to the U.S. State Department demanding that the U.S. immediately cease its "financial, military, and spiritual" aid to the Haitian government.

The "Haitian Revolutionary Front" was recently organized by Louis Déjoie and others exiled in Cuba. Déjoie, after failing in the 1957 presidential election, accused the military government that presided over the election of using various conspiracies during the election. It is reported that the "Haitian Revolutionary Front's" protest to the U.S. State Department was made after the news was released that the U.S. had decided to send Marines to Haiti. It is reported that the U.S. and the Haitian government signed an agreement at the end of last year. The agreement stipulates that a Marine Corps consisting of fifty-four U.S. officers and soldiers will go to Haiti to be "responsible for reorganizing and retraining" the Haitian armed forces in order to help consolidate Duvalier's "unstable current regime."

    美国支持海地亲美政府
    “海地革命阵线”提出抗议
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：海地流亡者最近对美国政府大力扶持亲美的海地弗朗索瓦·杜瓦利埃政府的作法提出了抗议。据“纽约时报”报道，一个名叫“海地革命阵线”的组织给美国国务院写了一封信，要求美国立即停止对海地政府的“财政、军事和精神上”的援助。
    “海地革命阵线”是由流亡在古巴的路易·儒瓦等人最近组织的。儒瓦在1957年的总统竞选中失败后，曾经指责主持选举的军政府在选举时采用了各种阴谋手段。据报道，“海地革命阵线”对美国国务院的抗议，是在美国决定派遣海军陆战队到海地去的消息发表之后提出的。有消息说，去年年底美国同海地政府签订了一项协定。这项协定规定由五十四名美国官兵组成的海军陆战队到海地“负责改组和重新训练”海地的武装部队，以协助巩固杜瓦利埃“不稳定的现政权”。
