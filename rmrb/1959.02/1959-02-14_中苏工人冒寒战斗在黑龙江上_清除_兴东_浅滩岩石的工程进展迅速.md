Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 13th: Chinese and Soviet waterway engineering personnel are battling temperatures of minus twenty to thirty degrees Celsius, actively working on the "Xingdong" shoal project in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River.

This shoal project is located in Xingdong Town, Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province, and is a rocky shoal 3,000 meters long and 80 meters wide. Every year during the dry season, it greatly hinders navigation on the Heilongjiang River. The project to straighten the shoal involves removing 100,000 cubic meters of rock from the riverbed, increasing the water depth from one meter to 2.2 meters.

The project is being carried out over four months, taking advantage of the northern winter season which is suitable for ice operations. After the Heilongjiang River froze into a solid layer of ice at the end of November last year, Chinese and Soviet workers used the "water flow freezing method" to remove layers of ice from the riverbed, exposing the rocks. Then, they drilled holes in the hard rocks using drilling machines, and then poured explosives into the holes to blast them. Currently, the 1,000-meter shoal project near the downstream direction has been completed, and the remaining 2,000-meter shoal is expected to be completed in 1962. By then, Chinese and Soviet vessels will be able to travel unimpeded from Boli, the Soviet port at the confluence of the Ussuri River and the Heilongjiang River, to Hailanpao in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River; and from Harbin and Jiamusi in China, to Heihe, the northernmost town in China, even during the dry season.

In the joint Chinese-Soviet project to straighten the shoal, Chinese waterway engineering personnel have received selfless assistance from the highly skilled and well-equipped Soviet shipping departments. When the Chinese workers first arrived at the construction site, they had no experience and did not know how to blast the shoal. The Soviet waterway engineering personnel enthusiastically guided them while working, enabling the Chinese workers to quickly master the techniques. The construction site is far from Harbin, in a remote area with inconvenient transportation. Soviet friends also provided timely support to Chinese workers in terms of material supply and medical care.

The project to straighten the shoals in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River officially started in December 1957, based on the Sino-Soviet Border River Navigation and Construction Agreement signed in 1951. Experimental projects had been carried out for two years prior to this.

### 中苏工人冒寒战斗在黑龙江上  清除“兴东”浅滩岩石的工程进展迅速

    中苏工人冒寒战斗在黑龙江上
    清除“兴东”浅滩岩石的工程进展迅速
    新华社哈尔滨13日电　中苏两国的航道工程人员正冒着零下二、三十度的严寒，积极整治黑龙江中游的“兴东”浅滩工程。
    这个浅滩工程位于我国黑龙江省萝北县兴东镇，是个长三千公尺、宽八十公尺的岩石浅滩，每年枯水季节，对黑龙江航运有很大妨碍。整治浅滩的工程，就是要清除掉这里十万立方公尺的河底岩石，使水深由一公尺加深到二点二公尺。
    工程是利用北方冬季适于冰上作业的四个月时间进行的。去年11月底黑龙江水结成了坚硬的冰层后，中苏两国工人采用“水流冻结法”，一层层地清除河床上的冰块，露出河底岩石以后，用钻机向坚硬的岩石钻孔，再在钻出的孔中灌入炸药进行爆炸。现在，靠近下游方向的一千公尺浅滩工程已经完成，其余的二千公尺浅滩，预计在1962年可以完成。到那时，中苏两国的船只，从乌苏里江口和黑龙江会合的苏联的伯力，到黑龙江中游的海兰泡；从我国哈尔滨、佳木斯，到我国最北方城镇黑河，即使在枯水期间也可以畅行无阻。
    在中苏两国共同整治浅滩工程中，中国的航道工程人员得到了技术高超、装备精良的苏联航运部门的无私帮助。中国工人初到工地时，由于没有经验，不会炸滩，苏联的航道工程人员就一边工作一边热情地指导，使中国工人很快掌握了技术。工地离哈尔滨很远，地区偏僻，交通不便，苏联友人在物资供应和疾病医疗方面也对中国工人进行了及时的支援。
    整治黑龙江中游的浅滩工程，是根据1951年签订的中苏国境河流航行及建设协定，在1957年12月正式开工的。在这以前曾进行过两年的试验性工程。
