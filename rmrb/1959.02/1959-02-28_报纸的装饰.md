    Newspaper Decoration
    Qin Li
    Newspaper layout is a delicate art. Some newspapers grab your attention right away with their appropriate page arrangement, prominent focus, lively and dynamic style. The headlines, borders, masthead art, illustrations, and photographs are all arranged just right, adding to the newspaper's appeal, truly embodying "simplicity and elegance, diverse forms, rich illustrations, and vibrant colors." Some newspapers are less meticulous, with monotonous layouts. Although the content may be good, they don't necessarily compel you to read them. It seems that putting some effort into the visual presentation of newspapers is definitely worthwhile. However, I believe that some of the newspaper decorations used recently are worth examining. As a reader, I'll offer my humble opinion.
    First is the use of red ink. Some newspapers use red ink almost every day for several consecutive days—red headlines, even entire pages in red, some even use a variety of colors, like a picture book. Red ink is meant to signify celebration and is generally used only for major happy events or significant holidays. If it's overused, it loses its significance. It's like issuing special editions; if you issue special editions every day, what's the point of calling them "special"?
    Secondly, some newspapers like to print large red flags on the page or decorate the perimeter with large paintings, taking up a lot of space. Some even overprint slogans and decorative paintings on top of the text. Is it beautiful? Not necessarily, it makes it difficult to read.
    A newspaper is, after all, a newspaper, not a picture book. Although it should strive for "rich illustrations," the "text" is still the primary focus. Making the newspaper look more attractive is necessary, of course, but it also requires skill. "Heavy makeup" isn't necessarily beautiful; sometimes "light makeup" may be more suitable. One reader suggested to the editorial department of a provincial newspaper: "Sometimes you take the signboard down and put it on the doorstep!" (referring to moving the newspaper's masthead around arbitrarily, even placing it at the bottom of the front page). I think this suggestion is worth pondering.

    报纸的装饰
    秦犁
    报纸的排版大有讲究。有的报纸一拿起来，你就被吸引住了，它的版面安排适当，中心突出，形式生动活泼，标题，花边，题花，插图，照片都安排得恰到好处，为报纸增色不少，真个是“朴素大方，形式多样，图文并茂，丰富多彩”。有的报纸就不那么讲究，版面单调，内容虽好，却不那么使人觉得非看不可。看来，在报纸版面的形式上花点功夫，是大有必要的。但是最近一个时期，报纸的有些装饰我认为是值得研究的，作为一个读者，也就姑妄言之吧。
    首先是套红。有些报纸在一连好多天内几乎是天天套红——标题套红，甚至全版套红，有的更是五颜六色，像个画报一样。套红是为了表示喜庆，一般是在有重大喜事，或重大节日的时候才用。假如滥用，那就没有什么意义了。犹之乎出号外一样，假如天天出号外，那又算什么“号外”呢？
    其次有的报纸爱在版面上印上大红旗，或周围装饰大幅的画，占去了不少的篇幅。有的甚至把标语字和装饰画套印在文字上面。美观么？不见得，倒使人读起来很困难。
    报纸终归是报纸，不是画报，虽说是要做到“图文并茂”，但是“文”还是主要的。把报纸打扮得好看些，当然需要，但是也要会打扮，“浓装”不一定就美，有时“淡抹”也许更相宜。有个读者对一个省报编辑部提意见说：“你们有时把招牌摘下来放到门槛上了！”（指把报头随意移来移去，甚至放在一版最下面）。我认为这个意见，值得深思一番。
