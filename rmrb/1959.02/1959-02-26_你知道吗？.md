Did you know?

Why is the gauge (distance between the rails) of railways in many countries now four feet eight and a half inches (147.83 cm)? It turns out that the wheel gauge of ancient Roman chariots was this wide. In 55 BC, the army of Julius Caesar's Roman Empire invaded Britain, and their chariots were imitated by the Celtic people living in Britain. Therefore, for hundreds of years, a "track" of 147.83 cm was rolled out on the roads of Britain. In order to adapt to this "track", the later pony carts were also made this wide. The width of the Roman chariot ruts has been used until today, more than two thousand years later. (Xi)

    你知道吗？
    为什么现在许多国家铁路的轨距（铁轨间的距离）是四呎八点五吋（一四七点八三公分）呢？原来古罗马战车的轮距就是这样宽。公元前五十五年，罗马帝国柴塞尔的军队侵入不列颠，他们的战车为居住在不列颠的居尔特人所仿制，因此，几百年来，英国的路上辗开了一四七点八三公分的“轨迹”，为了适应这一“轨迹”所以后来的小马车也作了这么宽。罗马战车车辙的宽度，一直沿用到两千多年以后的今天。（熙）
