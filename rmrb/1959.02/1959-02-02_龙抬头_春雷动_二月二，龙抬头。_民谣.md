    The Dragon Raises Its Head, Spring Thunder Rumbles
    Second day of the Second Month, the dragon raises its head. - Folk Song
    Du Ruoxiang
    In my hometown, there is a legend: After a year of soaring in the sky, the dragon goes to the bottom of a deep pool to spend the winter during the harsh cold season. People call that pool the Dragon Pool. In the depths of winter, layers of ice and snow seal the mouth of the pool, the earth is quiet, and the dragon hibernates at the bottom of the pool. It is not until the second day of the second month of the coming year that the breath of spring permeates the bottom of the pool, and the dragon slowly awakens, raising its head from the dark pool, taking a long breath, and moving its body. Then, with a crack of thunder, it flies out of the mouth of the pool, and with another sound, it soars into the sky, straight into the clouds, starting its new journey.
    In that instant, the first spring thunder resounds in the human world.
    Then, green grass sprouts from the ground, swallows flutter their wings, all trees sprout, rivers thaw, and all things in heaven and earth awaken from their dormant winter sleep, joyfully full of life.
    This is, of course, just a legend. According to archaeologists, the dragon is just an animal in people's imagination, and it is doubtful whether it ever existed in history. The spring thunder is, of course, even more unrelated to the dragon. However, I still very much like this legend. Because it can arouse people's yearning for spring, and arouse many imaginings, as if seeing a magnificent and majestic picture.
    Now it is the second day of the second month, and it is time for the dragon to raise its head again! Of course, the legendary second day of the second month refers to the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar. However, the spring of the socialist era comes even earlier. Look, hasn't the dragon already raised its head?
    Before our eyes, there is a golden giant dragon, which, after traveling for a year in the eastern blue sea and sky, after taking a slight rest after traveling ninety thousand miles, looks around, chants loudly, and embarks on a new journey. Its entire body of scales and armor, illuminated by the rising sun, shines with ten thousand points of golden light, making it difficult for people to open their eyes. It dances in the sky, tumbling in the sea of clouds, setting out from the East Sea in the morning and resting in the Kunlun Mountains in the evening. Behind it, it leaves a long golden glow, a long road leading to the heavenly palace.
    This giant dragon is our socialist motherland!
    Our motherland's great leap forward of 1959 did not start today, on the second day of the second month, but from the first minute of the new year, or, to be precise, from last winter. It began when the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to march towards new targets, from the time we won 10.7 million tons of steel, from the time we harvested 750 billion catties of grain, from the time our people's communes emerged from the horizon like the rising sun, from the time our 650 million people sang and danced for the glorious victory of last year. When has our great motherland, this giant dragon, ever stopped running?
    Ah, listen, listen, aren't these spring thunders resounding?
    The first spring thunder resounds from the vast land: the movement to accumulate and create fertilizer has begun. Like the water conservancy movement last spring, it mobilized thousands of troops and horses, spread throughout cities and villages. It is truly: carriages like flowing water, horses like dragons, flowers and moon, and a gentle spring breeze. The battlefield covering the sky and the earth won the first credit for increasing the yield of crops this year. Under the call of the Party Central Committee, from south to north, from east to west, where is there no team accumulating and creating fertilizer! Look, who are those rolling up their sleeves, carrying manure baskets, building toilets, and digging peat there? These are the county party secretary, the county head, and the heads of various departments of Wuchang County, Heilongjiang; over there, on the frozen, hard road, teachers are leading students, taking sleds to and from school, picking up manure while walking; in more than a month, more than fifty indigenous fertilizer plants and bacterial fertilizer factories have been scattered in various villages. Look, this is the Penglai Commune in Yiliang County, Yunnan. As soon as it dawns, the young and strong go up the mountain to cut thatch, and the elderly are sweeping leaves and accumulating manure around the village. Listen, people are singing: "Accumulate manure early in the morning, songs fill the fields, fertilizer piles up like mountains, and granaries reach the sky."
    Fertilizer piles up like mountains, and granaries reach the sky. This first spring thunder is so loud, so loud! It is as grand as a giant star and has the power to shake mountains and rivers. Thousands of troops and horses vibrate the strings of the earth, playing the prelude to this year's agricultural great leap forward.
    Vigorously carrying out mass movements and vigorously engaging in technological revolution is the first spring thunder on our industrial front this year. Hard work must be combined with skillful work, and drive must be combined with research, so that we can take down 18 million tons of steel and turn this year's targets into sparkling products! At an order, tens of millions of people acted. And listen to their bold words:
    Heroes spread their wings, hating the sky is too low,
    Flying into the heavenly palace without a ladder,
    Offering strategies to grasp the dragon's dance,
    Bravely able to embrace the fierce tiger home.
              (Mudanjiang Cement Plant)
    In front of the heroes who "spread their wings, hating the sky is too low," what difficulties can scare them? Yes, completing this year's production targets is not an easy task. But as long as everyone contributes ideas and everyone is brave, what are the big and small difficulties! Look, Liao Shigang, a young milling worker from Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant, handed over his 1959 leap forward plan to the Party and Youth League organizations and immediately began to act. Only ten days into the new year, he innovated an operating technique and increased work efficiency by one hundred and sixty times. One hundred and sixty times, this is not a simple number! In it, there is the determination and confidence of young people, and unlimited hope for over fulfilling this year's targets! Didn't this fire the first shot of this year?
    Liao Shigang is just one of our tens of millions of workers. One Liao Shigang walks in front, and tens of millions of Liao Shigangs will immediately follow.
    The first shot has already been fired, hurry up and advance victoriously, and seize the victory of the second round!
    The first shot has not yet been fired, hurry up and catch up with renewed efforts! This is exactly:
    Three years of hard struggle depends on this year,
    Don't waste the great time,
    Ten thousand horses gallop forward together,
    Riding the wind and waves, taking the lead!
    The dragon raises its head, and the spring thunder rumbles. The breath of spring has penetrated into the hearts of each of us, infiltrating the lungs of each person. Take a long breath of fresh air, which is so rich in the fragrance of earth. The breath of spring fills our bodies with warmth, heat, and vitality. Looking around, a spring scene, mountains and fields, the sound of war drums is loud. In this situation, who can not open their arms and jump forward to embrace spring, who can still leisurely stroll?

    龙抬头　春雷动
    二月二，龙抬头。——民谣
    杜若湘
    我们家乡有个传说：龙在天上翱翔了一年之后，到了严寒时节，便要到深深的潭底去过冬。那个潭，人们便管它叫龙潭。十冬腊月，层层的冰雪封住了潭口，大地静悄悄，龙，在潭底冬眠。直等到来年二月二，春天的气息透入潭底，龙便悠悠地苏醒，从黑黝黝的深潭里台起头来，长长地嘘一口气，动一动龙身。于是，霹雳一声，飞出潭口，再一声，便腾空而起，直冲九霄，开始它新的云游去了。
    在这一霎那间，人间便响起了第一声春雷。
    于是，青草钻出地面，燕子抖动翅膀，万木生芽，河流解冻，天地万物从静止的冬眠中醒来，欣欣然充满着生意了。
    这自然只是传说。据考古学家们说，龙只是人们想像里的动物，历史上是否有过，都值得怀疑。春雷动，自然更与龙无关了。但是，我仍然十分喜欢这个传说。因为它能引起人们对春天的向往，引起了联翩的浮想，仿佛见到一幅气势磅礴、雄伟壮丽的图景。
    如今正是二月二，又该是龙抬头的时候了！当然，传说中的二月二，指的是旧历，不是阳历。然而社会主义时代的春天来得更早，你看，龙不是已经抬头了么？
    我们的眼前，正有一条金色的巨龙，在东方的碧海长空遨游一年之后，在行程九万里略事休憩之后，抬头四顾，长吟一声，奔上了新的行程。它的全身鳞甲，在旭日照耀下，闪烁着万点金光，逼得人睁不开眼。它在苍天下飞舞，在云海里翻腾，朝发东海，暮宿昆仓。在它的身后，留下了长长的金色的光芒，一条长长的通向天宫的大路。
    这条巨龙，就是我们的社会主义祖国！
    我们祖国的1959年大跃进，并不是从今天二月二才开始的，而是从新年的第一分钟就开始了，或者，确切些说，从去年冬天就开始了。从党的八届六中全会发出了奔向新指标的号召的时候就开始了，从我们夺得了1070万吨钢的时候就开始了，从我们收到了七千五百亿斤粮食的时候就开始了，从我们的人民公社像初升的太阳从地平线上出现的时候就开始了，从我们的六亿五千万人为去年的辉煌胜利载歌载舞的时候就开始了。我们的伟大的祖国这条巨龙，它什么时候曾经停止过奔驰呢？
    啊，你听，你听，这不是一声声春雷响起了么？
    从广阔的大地上响起了第一声春雷：积肥造肥运动开始了。像去年春天的水利运动一样，它引动了千军万马，遍布了城市乡村。真正是：车如流水马如龙，花月正春风。漫天遍野的战场，为今年的农作物增产夺得头功。在党中央的号召下，从南到北，从东到西，哪儿没有积肥造肥的队伍啊！你看捋起袖子，背着粪筐，在那里起厕所、挖草炭的是些谁呀？这是黑龙江五常县的县委书记、县长和各部门的负责人；那边，在冻得坚硬的路上，老师带着学生，上学下学带爬犁边走路边拣粪；一个多月工夫，五十多个土化肥厂、细菌肥料工厂就散布在各个乡村了。你看，这是云南宜良县的蓬莱公社，天才刚亮，青壮年就上山割茅草了，老年人正在村边扫树叶，积粪草。你听，人们在唱：“清早积粪肥，歌声漫田野，肥料堆成山，粮囤高接天。”
    肥料堆成山，粮囤高接天。这第一声春雷好响、好响啊！气吞牛斗，声震山河，千军万马，把大地的琴弦震得琤琤琮琮，奏起了今年农业大跃进的序曲。
    大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，是我们的工业战线上今年的第一声春雷。苦干还要加巧干，干劲还要加钻劲，这才能拿下1800万吨钢，才能把今年的指标变成亮晶晶的产品！一声令下，千万人就行动起来。且听听他们的豪言壮语：
    英雄展翅恨天低，
    飞进天宫不用梯，
    献策抓住蛟龙舞，
    奋勇能抱猛虎归。
              （牡丹江水泥厂）
    在“展翅恨天低”的英雄们面前，还有什么困难能吓倒他们呢？是的，完成今年的生产指标，并不是易如反掌的事。但是只要人人献策，个个奋勇，大小困难，又何足道哉！你看，重庆建设机床厂青年铣工廖世刚，他向党、团组织交出了自己的1959年跃进规划，立即就开始行动。新年才过了十天，他就革新了一项操作技术，提高了工效一百六十倍。一百六十倍，这可不是一个简单的数字！这里面有青年人的决心和信心，有超额完成今年指标的无限希望！这不就打响今年的第一炮了么？
    廖世刚只是我们几千万工人中的一个。一个廖世刚走在前面，千万个廖世刚马上就会跟上来。
    第一炮已经打响了的，赶快乘胜前进，夺取第二回合的胜利吧！
    第一炮还没有打响的，赶快再接再厉赶上去吧！这正是：
    三年苦战看今年，
    大好时光莫等闲，
    万马奔腾齐跃进，
    乘风破浪着先鞭！
    龙抬头，春雷动。春天的气息已经透入我们每个人的心田，沁入每个人的肺腑。你长长地吸一口新鲜空气吧，那里面有多么浓郁的泥土芳香。春天的气息使我们全身充满了温暖，充满了热气，充满了活力。举目四望，一片春光，漫山遍野，战鼓声喧。此情此景，谁能不张开臂膀跳跃向前去拥抱春天，谁还能懒洋洋地踱方步呢？
