(From our correspondent) Kunming, February 11th - Eleven counties in Yunnan Province recently held an on-site meeting in Fumin County on the processing of spring crops. The meeting proposed to all counties in the province to seize the opportunity during the "Beginning of Spring" season to make a concentrated effort to improve the late-stage field management of wheat, and strive for high yields over large areas.

Dali, Dayao, Yuxi, Jianshui, Yiliang, Mile, Luliang, Fumin, Songming, Luxi and Jianchuan eleven counties in Yunnan, launched a revolutionary competition last October with the goal of achieving large-scale high yields of spring wheat. Farmers in these counties showed great enthusiasm and completed their wheat sowing plans ahead of schedule. Wheat fields were generally deep-plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot or more, with sufficient base fertilizer applied, and reasonable close planting was implemented. During field management, the counties also widely promoted the advanced experiences of "gardening-style field management" proposed by farmers in Yiliang County, and "workshop-style labor organization" proposed by farmers in Fumin County. The wheat seedlings in all counties are growing better than in any previous year, laying the foundation for large-scale high yields of wheat this year.

Currently, wheat in the southern regions of Yunnan has begun to head, while in the northern regions, it is in the jointing and booting stage. Field management during this period has a significant impact on wheat yield. Representatives from Dali, Dayao, and the other eleven counties visited the wheat fields in Fumin County at the end of last month. After in-depth observation and analysis of the wheat growth, they believed that the potential for increasing wheat production is still great. Most of the first-class seedlings, which are growing well, have already begun to head. If foliar fertilizer can be applied well and irrigation is carried out once, it will ensure more and larger ears with plump grains. Attention should be paid to preventing frost, lodging, and pests to reduce losses and obtain higher yields. Second-class seedlings are currently in the peak period of jointing and booting. In addition to topdressing fertilizer, irrigating, and preventing disasters, attention should be paid to nurturing the weaker seedlings and increasing tillering. Although the current growth of third-class seedlings, which are about to joint, is not as good as that of the first and second-class seedlings, the potential for increasing production is also great. If a quick-acting fertilizer is applied immediately, and irrigation is carried out once to make the seedlings strong and increase tillering, then continue to topdress and irrigate twice, production can be increased by 30% to 50% or even doubled.

Based on these situations identified through on-site inspection and research, the representatives of the eleven counties believe that it is necessary to seize the opportunity, muster greater efforts, and press ahead, focusing sharply on the late-stage field management of wheat during the "Beginning of Spring" season. After analyzing the current ideological state of cadres and the masses, the on-site meeting proposed that to do a good job in the late-stage field management of wheat, two ideological obstacles must be removed. One is that some cadres have complacency, believing that this year the wheat fields were plowed deeply, planted densely, and fertilized heavily, and now the seedlings are growing well, so production can be increased even with their eyes closed. The other is that some cadres and the masses believe that the growth of wheat has already been determined, and field management will not have much effect. The meeting believes that these ideas should be criticized.

    各类麦田增产潜力很大
    云南十一县建议抓紧小麦后期加工管理
    本报昆明11日电　云南省十一个县，最近在富民县举行小春作物加工现场会议。会议向全省各县提出了在立春节令中突击作好小麦后期加工，力争大面积高产的建议。
    云南大理、大姚、玉溪、建水、宜良、弥勒、陆良、富民、嵩明、?江、剑川十一个县，在去年10月以争取小春大面积高产为目标展开了革命竞赛。这些县的农民都拿出冲天的干劲，全部提前完成了小麦播种计划。麦田普遍深耕八寸至一尺以上，底肥充足，并且实行了合理密植。在田间管理中，各县又普遍推广了宜良县农民提出的田间管理园田化，和富民县农民提出的劳动组织车间化等先进经验。各县的麦苗比以往任何一年都长得好，打下了今年小麦大面积高产的基础。
    目前，云南南部地区的小麦已开始抽穗，北部地区正在拔节孕穗，这段时间的田间加工管理，对小麦产量影响极大。大理、大姚等十一个县的代表上月底参观了富民县的麦田，对小麦成长情况深入观察分析后，认为小麦的增产潜力还很大。目前成长较好的一类苗，大部分已开始抽穗，如果能够很好地施下根外追肥，浇一次“灌浆水”，就能保证穗多穗大，籽粒饱满；注意作好防霜、防倒伏、防虫等工作，可以减少损失，获得更高的产量。二类苗现正在拔节孕穗的盛期，除需要追肥灌水，防止灾害外，当前要注意培育瘦苗，增加分蘖。即将拔节的三类苗当前生长情况虽不及一、二类苗，但增产的潜力也很大，如果抓紧增施一道速效肥料，浇一次水，使苗棵肥壮，增加分蘖，然后再继续追肥润水两次，可以增产三、五成甚至一倍。
    十一个县的代表根据现场检查研究出的这些情况，认为必须抓紧时机，鼓起更大的劲头，乘胜追击，在立春节令中狠狠抓住小麦的后期加工管理。现场会议分析了目前干部和群众中的思想状况后，提出了要做好小麦的后期加工管理，必须解除两个思想障碍。一个是某些干部存在着自满情绪，认为今年麦田翻的深、种的密、施肥多，现在苗棵又长得好，闭起眼睛也能增产了。另一个是有的干部和群众认为，小麦成长已成定局，田间管理起不了多大作用。会议认为这些思想都应该予以批判。
