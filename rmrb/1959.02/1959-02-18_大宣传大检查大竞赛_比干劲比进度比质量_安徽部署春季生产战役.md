Anhui Deploys Spring Production Battle

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 17th dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference of secretaries of prefectural and municipal party committees on the evening of the 13th, mobilizing all parts of the province to actively carry out a grand campaign, grand inspection, and grand competition to launch a high tide of spring production in the next few days and strive for an even greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

In order to realize the main indicators of Anhui's greater leap forward in agricultural production this year, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that doing a good job in spring production is an important key. Because more than half of the grain crops are to be sown in the spring; all cotton is to be sown in the spring; and oil crops, except for wheat stubble sesame, are also to be sown in the spring. Other activities such as planting trees and afforestation, raising poultry, livestock, and aquatic products, etc., must also be carried out in the spring. A bumper harvest of summer crops depends on doing a good job of field management in the spring. Whether summer planting is done well also depends on how well the spring preparations are made. "A year's plan starts in spring," and the task of spring production is so important that the Provincial Party Committee requires that the large-scale production campaign be fast and not delayed.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that in order to quickly set off a high tide of spring production, it is necessary to use various propaganda forces to carry out a grand propaganda campaign.

Last year, Anhui suffered continuous natural disasters. Starting from the wheat planting the year before last, it suffered a severe drought. Most of the wheat was sown after fighting the drought. When the wheat was about to be harvested, it suffered a severe blight. Rice, in June, July, and August, when water was most needed, also suffered a rare drought, but even under such circumstances, it still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Last year, grain output increased by 70% compared with 1957, and cotton output increased by two times. Oil, hemp, tobacco, and other crops also increased a lot. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to use the propaganda of large-scale production throughout the province and in typical units to make everyone aware of this great victory. At the same time, we should also talk a lot about the conditions that are even more favorable this year than last year, and publicize advanced indicators and measures. Through this grand propaganda campaign, we must boost morale, carry forward enthusiasm, and ensure a greater leap forward this year. New right-leaning conservative ideas must be criticized; at the same time, we must also prevent complacency.

The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to immediately carry out a grand inspection of spring plowing preparations, and through the inspection, make full preparations for fertilizer, especially emphasizing the vigorous development of local chemical fertilizer production and increasing the yield of green manure. Now the province has accumulated 84 billion dan of fertilizer, and a lot of local chemical fertilizer has also been produced. However, according to the requirement of applying an additional 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu for summer crops and 3,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu for spring-sown crops, fertilizer is still not enough. In addition to continuing to accumulate a large amount of local miscellaneous fertilizer, we must vigorously develop local chemical fertilizer and green manure. Attention must be paid to improving the quality of local chemical fertilizer. The Party committees of all localities must strengthen the leadership of this work, formulate plans, establish local chemical fertilizer production headquarters, and vigorously carry out mass movements. We should find several local chemical fertilizers that have great prospects, abundant raw materials, and are easy to make, such as potassium feldspar, barium carbonate, soot, and soil nitrate, and focus on their development. Industrial and mining areas should also make extensive use of mineral slag, phosphorus slag, etc. The Huainan Coal Mine, Ma'anshan Iron Mine, and Tongguanshan Copper Mine base should use the above-mentioned raw materials to vigorously produce local chemical fertilizer, not only to guarantee the needs of their affiliated suburbs, but also to support other special zones. In all places where coke is produced, oil and ammonia must be extracted to facilitate the development of local chemical fertilizer. At the same time, we must greatly increase the yield of green manure, requiring all localities to plant green manure on the edges of fields, take out part of the mud bean, sesame, mung bean, barley, and rapeseed as green manure seeds, and plant a large number of reeds, vitex, etc. to increase green manure. These green manures have high fertilizer efficiency and can be applied locally, saving labor. This should be given great attention by all localities.

The Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that in addition to fertilizer, we must also vigorously grasp water conservancy. Now the province has completed more than 800 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is still far from completing the plan. It is required that the province must complete 3 billion cubic meters of earthwork this year. For water-scarce and drought-prone areas such as Fengyang, Shouxian, Dingyuan, Jiashan, Feixi, and Feidong counties, for flood-prone areas such as Suxian, Lingbi, Suixi, and Fengtai counties, and for areas that have extensively changed to rice cultivation, water conservancy construction should still be the focus of work. Because these areas need to do a good job of water conservancy projects to ensure harvest. Most of the labor force in these areas is used for water conservancy projects. It is required that key water conservancy projects must be completed before the flood season. The work of tool reform should also be grasped tightly.

The Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to inspect farm tools, seeds, draft animals, etc. The agricultural departments and industrial departments of all localities should quickly establish institutions, concentrate the original carpenters and blacksmiths to repair and add farm tools, and in mountainous areas with abundant wood, factories should be set up locally to manufacture farm tools and accessories. The transportation departments should do a good job in the transportation of seeds. It must be recognized that if transportation is not done well, the production plan cannot be completed.

Finally, the Provincial Party Committee called for a red flag competition movement between counties and counties, communes and communes, teams and teams, and people and people throughout the province, organizing inspections and evaluations, comparing enthusiasm, comparing progress, and comparing quality, and vigorously launching the spring production movement.

    大宣传大检查大竞赛　比干劲比进度比质量
    安徽部署春季生产战役
    本报合肥17日电　中共安徽省委13日晚召开地市委书记电话会议，动员全省各地积极开展大宣传、大检查、大竞赛，在几天之内掀起春季大生产热潮，为今年农业生产更大跃进而奋斗。
    为了实现安徽今年农业生产更大跃进的主要指标，省委指出，搞好春季大生产是一个重要关键。因为粮食作物有一半以上要在春季播种；棉花全部都要在春季播种；油料作物除麦茬芝麻外，也都要在春季播种。其他如植树造林，家禽、家畜、水产等的养殖，也要在春季进行。夏收作物的丰收，要靠春季作好田间管理。夏种是否搞的好，也要以春季的准备工作做的好坏为前提。“一年之计在于春”，春季生产任务这样重大，省委要求开展大生产运动要快，不能迟误。
    省委指出，要迅速掀起春季大生产热潮，就要运用各种宣传力量，开展大宣传运动。
   去年安徽连续遭受天灾，从前年种麦开始，便遭大旱，大部抗旱下种，小麦到快收割时又遭了严重疸灾；水稻在六、七、八月最需要水的时候，又遭到少有的旱灾，但是就在这种情况下，仍然获得了史无前例的大丰收。去年粮食产量比1957年增加了70％，棉花产量增加了二倍。油料、麻、烟叶等也都增产很多。省委要求各地，通过对全省和典型单位大生产的宣传，使每一个人都认识这一伟大胜利。同时，还应大讲特讲今年比去年更加有利的条件，宣传先进的指标和措施。通过这次大宣传，鼓舞士气，发扬干劲，保证今年更大的跃进。对新的右倾保守思想必须进行批判；同时还要防止骄傲自满情绪。
    省委要求各地立即开展春耕准备大检查，通过检查充分作好准备关于肥料特别强调要大力发展土化肥生产，增加绿肥的产量。现在全省已积肥八百四十亿担，土化肥也生产不少。但是按照夏收作物每亩再追肥一千担和春播作物每亩施基肥三千担的要求，肥料还是不够的。除继续大积土杂肥外，要大搞土化肥和绿肥。对土化肥要重视提高质量。各地党委要加强这一工作的领导，订出计划，成立土肥化生产指挥部，大搞群众运动。要找几个前途大、原料多、容易做的土化肥，如钾长石、碳酸钡、煤烟、土硝等，着重发展。工矿区的矿渣、磷渣等也要大量利用。淮南煤矿、马鞍山铁矿、铜官山铜矿基地，要利用上述原料大搞土化肥，不但保证所属郊区的需要，还要支援其他各专区。各地炼焦，要一律提取油和氨，以利发展土化肥。同时要大大提高绿肥的产量，要求各地在田塝上大种绿肥，拿出部分泥豆、芝麻、绿豆、大麦、油菜做绿肥种子，并大量种芦苇、荆条等，增加绿肥，这些绿肥，肥效高又能就地施用，节省劳动力，应该引起各地十分重视。
    省委还指出，除肥料外，还要大抓水利。现在全省已做土方八亿多立方，距离完成计划还很远，要求全省今年一定要完成三十亿土方。对于缺水、易旱地区如凤阳、寿县、定远、嘉山、肥西、肥东等县，对于易涝地区如宿县、灵璧、濉溪、凤台等县及大量改种水稻的地区，仍应把兴修水利作为工作重点。因为这些地区需要作好水利工程，才能保证收成。这些地区大部劳动力用来做水利工程。要求重点水利工程，一定保证汛前完工。对工具改革工作也要抓紧进行。
    省委还要求各地检查农具种子、耕畜等。各地农业部门和工业部门要迅速建立机构，把原来的木匠、铁匠集中起来对农具进行整修和添置，在山区木头多的地方，要就地设厂制造农具和配件。交通运输部门应把调运种子的工作做好，必须认识运输搞不好生产计划就完不成。
    最后省委号召在全省范围内开展县和县、社和社、队和队、人和人之间的红旗竞赛运动，组织检查评比，比干劲、比进度、比质量，把春季大生产运动轰轰烈烈开展起来。（附图片）
