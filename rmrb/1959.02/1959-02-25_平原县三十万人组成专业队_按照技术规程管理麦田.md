Pingyuan County Organizes 300,000 People into Specialized Teams
    To Manage Wheat Fields According to Technical Regulations

    (Our report) Pingyuan County (including the former De County and En County) in Shandong Province, with its more than 800,000 people, is marching forward with heroic steps towards a new great goal—striving for a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin of wheat across the county's 1.22 million mu. Currently, 300,000 people in the county are engaged in the wheat field management campaign. The vast majority of wheat seedlings are complete in clumps and strong in each plant; the number of tillers per mu in general fields has reached 700,000 to 1 million, and in large-area high-yield fields and satellite fields, the number of tillers per mu has reached 1 to 2 million.

    This year, Pingyuan County's proposal to strive for a 2,000-jin county in wheat production is a great encouragement to the people of the entire county. People have proposed: to put forward 20% of the measures, and 30% of the effort, to ensure the 2,000-jin target. The so-called 20% measures are to fully implement the "Eight-Character Charter" [for agriculture]. The entire county has achieved river network development and mechanized wells, basically controlling drought and flood disasters, and ensuring sufficient water sources for wheat. Last year, the sowing of more than 1.2 million mu of winter wheat in the county was not only earlier than in previous years, but generally also involved deep plowing of about 1.5 chi, with 50,000 to 60,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, and a sowing rate of 30 to 50 jin in general. Now, from the county to the commune and team levels, leading cadres, particularly the First Secretaries, have been put in charge to establish wheat field management command organizations. Each commune has organized specialized wheat field management teams, implementing a top-down wheat field management responsibility system.

    Due to the strengthening of leadership over wheat field management, the wheat field management campaign has been powerfully promoted. In the past, the cultivation here was relatively extensive. After the wheat was sown, there was no habit of watering, topdressing, or cultivating. The wheat field management command, in accordance with local conditions, formulated technical operating procedures, enabling the masses to understand how to ensure the quality of wheat field management and changing the habit of extensive cultivation. Now, 920,000 mu of wheat fields have been reformed into ridge fields. The county is actively expanding gravity irrigation, newly digging more than 4,000 dry and branch canals, ensuring that the county's rivers, ditches, reservoirs, and wells are interconnected, which has played a significant role in watering ridge fields and reducing labor intensity. Since last winter, waves of fertilizer accumulation have followed one after another. In particular, after the State Council's instructions on fertilizer accumulation were announced, more than 300,000 people across the county engaged in a fertilizer accumulation and production competition campaign every day. Before the Spring Festival, the original plan was to accumulate 10 billion jin of fertilizer (including fertilizer for spring sowing crops) in ten days. Due to the widespread upsurge of the competition campaign, the task was completed in five days, and the quality was also good. More than 1.2 million mu of wheat in the county have been generally watered twice and topdressed twice, of which 500,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields and 160,000 mu of satellite fields have been watered and topdressed three or four times or more (with each fertilization amount increased by 50% compared to large fields). Various places have paid attention to technical operations in topdressing. Since the prevention of cold and frost, a layer of organic fertilizer has been added to 450,000 mu of wheat fields, 380,000 mu of wheat fields have been compacted, and windbreaks have been set up in more than 100,000 mu of satellite fields. Some have even built glass greenhouses. Communes have established pest and disease prevention stations and organized pest detection teams. The county has prepared more than 3 million jin of native and foreign pesticides and established meteorological stations.

    Various localities have also carried out large-scale cooperation in wheat field management, effectively promoting the balanced development of the wheat field management campaign.

    平原县三十万人组成专业队
    按照技术规程管理麦田
    本报讯　山东省平原县（包括原德县和恩县）八十余万人民正迈着英雄的步伐向新的伟大目标进军——力争全县一百二十二万亩小麦亩产二千斤。现在全县有三十万人投入麦田管理运动。绝大部分麦苗墩墩齐全，棵棵茁壮；一般田每亩分蘖已达七十至一百万株，大面积高产田和卫星田每亩分蘖达一、二百万株。
    今年平原县提出小麦力争实现二千斤县，对全县人民是很大的鼓舞。人们提出：拿出二十分的措施，三十分的干劲，来保证二千斤的指标。所谓二十分措施，就是全面贯彻“八字宪法”。全县已实现了河网化和机井化，基本上控制了旱涝灾害，保证了小麦的充足水源。去年全县一百二十多万亩冬小麦的播种不仅比往年提早，而且一般还深翻一尺半左右，每亩施肥五、六万斤，播种量一般三十至五十斤。现在从县到社、队，都以第一书记挂帅，成立了麦田管理指挥机构，各公社组织了麦田管理专业队，自上而下的实行了麦田管理责任制。
    由于加强了对麦田管理的领导，有力地推动了麦田管理运动。过去，这里的耕作比较粗放，小麦下种后，没有浇水追肥中耕等习惯；麦田管理指挥部因地制宜地制定了技术操作规程，使群众了解如何保证麦田管理的质量，改变了耕作粗放的习惯。现在有九十二万亩麦田修整成畦田，全县积极扩大自流灌溉，新挖干、支渠等四千多条，保证了全县的河、沟、（水）库、井脉脉相通，这对于畦田浇水和减轻劳动强度，起了很大作用。去冬以来，积肥高潮一个接一个，特别是国务院的积肥指示公布后，全县每天有三十余万人投入积肥造肥竞赛运动。春节前，原计划十天积肥一百亿斤（包括春播作物的肥），由于竞赛运动的普遍高涨，五天完成了任务，质量也好。全县一百二十余万亩小麦普遍浇水二次，追肥二次，其中五十万亩大面积高产田和十六万亩卫星田的浇水、追肥都在三、四次以上（每次施肥量比大田增加50％）。各地追肥都重视技术操作。防寒防冻以来，有四十五万亩麦田加盖了一层有机肥，有三十八万亩麦田进行镇压，十余万亩卫星田设置了防风障，有的还盖了玻璃温室。各公社设立了病虫害预防站，组织了除虫侦察队。全县已准备土、洋农药三百余万斤，建立了气象站。
    各地在麦田管理中还开展大协作，有力地推动了麦田管理运动的平衡发展。
