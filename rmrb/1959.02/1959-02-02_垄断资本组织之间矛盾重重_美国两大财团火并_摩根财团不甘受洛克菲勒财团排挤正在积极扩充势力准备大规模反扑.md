Conflicts Rife Among Monopoly Capital Organizations
Two Major U.S. Financial Groups Clash
Morgan Group Unwilling to be Squeezed Out by Rockefeller Group, Actively Expanding Power, Preparing Large-Scale Counterattack

    New York Dispatch: American newspapers are widely discussing a recent major event that has shaken Wall Street: Morgan Company announced its merger with Guarantee Trust Company, and American Telephone & Telegraph Company simultaneously announced an increase in the number of shares issued and a substantial increase in dividends.

    Morgan Company is a large bank founded ninety-six years ago in the United States. It is the headquarters and origin of the Morgan financial group. According to the December 29th issue of "Time" magazine last year, although the bank's book assets are only about $800 million, "it has never lost the aristocratic aura of leadership (over American finance) that it effectively acquired when it was founded in 1862." The magazine pointed out that countless large American companies are influenced by this bank, including "DuPont, General Motors, International Harvester, American Telephone & Telegraph, and U.S. Steel."

    Guarantee Trust Company is another important stronghold of the Morgan financial group, an investment bank with assets of approximately $2.5 billion. As for American Telephone & Telegraph Company, it is also controlled by the Morgan financial group, with total assets of more than $10 billion.

    These measures taken by the Morgan financial group, the largest monopoly capital organization in the United States, are considered very unusual on Wall Street, because the companies involved in the merger already possessed huge assets. When commenting on this matter, some American big business publications generally believe that this is a strategic move by the Morgan financial group to strengthen its monopoly position, with the spearhead directly aimed at Rockefeller. Morgan Company Chairman Alexander actually admitted this when announcing the merger. He pointed out that with the development of other large banks, Morgan Company is no longer one of the top banks in the United States. The merger between Morgan Company and Guarantee Trust Company is precisely for "more effective competition," including competition with Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank, whose funds are now far more abundant than those of Morgan Company.

    According to American newspapers, Morgan Company has always been the "financial center" of the United States. In 1895, the company "saved" the then crisis-ridden U.S. government through gold loans. During World War I, it acted as the financial agent for Britain and France, and played a significant role in drafting the Dawes Plan after the war. Morgan Company's influence on the American financial community, the business community, and even the government is so great that "for Americans, there is practically nothing more symbolic of financial power and immensity than the name Morgan," and Morgan himself believed that "he could be on equal footing with the U.S. President" (Newsweek).

    However, these newspapers pointed out that in recent years, the invincible Morgan financial group's position has undergone some changes, and it is facing severe competition from other financial groups, especially the Rockefeller financial group. This is first manifested in the rapid change in the comparison of economic strength between the Morgan and Rockefeller financial groups. According to recent statistics, the total assets of the various large enterprises controlled by the Morgan financial group are $65.4 billion, $4 billion more than the Rockefeller financial group's $61.4 billion. However, from a development perspective, due to the astonishing profits obtained by the Rockefeller financial group through oil investment and the pervasive plunder of underdeveloped countries, its growth in power has far exceeded that of the Morgan financial group. In total, twenty-five years ago, the Morgan financial group's assets were twice those of the Rockefeller financial group, but now the two are almost equal. In this situation, the Rockefeller financial group still colludes with the Morgan group in some respects, but on the other hand, it does not relax its offensive opportunities against the Morgan financial group. In 1955, Rockefeller's Chase Bank announced the largest merger in the history of the American banking industry with Manhattan Bank, directly threatening Morgan's power. At that time, Morgan's Banking Trust Company immediately announced a merger with Public National Bank and Trust Company to show its counterattack, but it seems that this has not been able to change the shift in the balance of power between the two financial groups.

    The Morgan financial group is also challenged by the Rockefeller financial group in terms of influencing the U.S. government, although they still speak with one voice in many aspects of American foreign policy and domestic policy measures. Currently, people in the U.S. government like Secretary of State Dulles and Secretary of Commerce Strauss are agents of Rockefeller. Rockefeller has a greater say in policy decisions, and their opinions sometimes differ from those of the Morgan financial group. And since Nelson Rockefeller was elected Governor of New York State at the end of last year, the Rockefeller family's ambition for the U.S. presidency has become a well-known fact. Some American publications pointed out that in the past, American presidents, such as Grant, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Wilson, were all selected by the Morgan group, but later, due to the growth of Rockefeller's power, in recent years, the master of the White House had to get the support of the Rockefeller financial group to a greater extent to be elected.

    It is precisely under the aggressive circumstances of the Rockefeller financial group that the Morgan financial group decided to launch a large-scale counterattack, and its means are to try its best to strengthen its power in the financial community and expand its main manufacturing industries. It is said that the reason why American Telephone & Telegraph Company increased the number of shares issued and raised dividends was to absorb more funds to expand its power, so as to compete more vigorously, especially in undertaking government military orders.

    From all indications, the merger and expansion of the power of companies affiliated with the Morgan financial group are now just the beginning. United Press International reported on January 21 that a spokesman for the Morgan financial group revealed that the next step in the merger plan is the merger of Banking Trust Company and Manufacturers Trust Company, and the merged organization will have more than $6.7 billion in assets.

    垄断资本组织之间矛盾重重
    美国两大财团火并
    摩根财团不甘受洛克菲勒财团排挤正在积极扩充势力准备大规模反扑
    本报讯　纽约消息：美国报刊正在纷纷谈论最近震动华尔街的一件大事：摩根公司宣布同保证信托公司合并，美国电讯公司同时宣布增加股票的发行额，并且大大提高股息。
    摩根公司是美国一家创立了九十六年的大银行，它是摩根财团的大本营和发源地。据去年12月29日一期的“时代”周刊说，这家银行的账面资产虽然只有约八亿美元，但是“它从没有丧失在1862年成立时实际上已经取得的（对美国金融的）领导权的贵族气息”。杂志指出，受这家银行影响的有无数美国大公司，其中包括“杜邦公司、通用汽车公司、国际收割机公司、美国电讯公司和美国钢铁公司”。
    保证信托公司是摩根财团的另一个重要据点，它是一家拥有约二十五亿美元资产的投资银行。至于美国电讯公司，它也是由摩根财团控制，资产总值高达一百多亿美元。
    摩根财团这个美国最大的垄断资本组织采取这些措施在华尔街被认为很不寻常，因为进行合并的公司原来各自拥有的资产已经是够庞大的了。美国一些大企业的刊物在评论这件事时普遍认为，这是摩根财团在加强它的垄断地位的一个战略性行动，其矛头则直接指向洛克菲勒。摩根公司的董事长亚历山大在宣布合并时事实上也承认这一点。他指出，随着其他大银行的发展，摩根公司现在已经不是美国数一数二的大银行了。这次摩根公司同保证信托公司合并正是为了“更有效地进行竞争”，其中包括同资金现在比摩根公司远为雄厚的洛克菲勒的曼哈顿大通银行竞争。
    据美国报刊说，在过去，摩根公司一直是美国的“财政中心”。1895年，这家公司曾经通过黄金贷款“挽救了”当时陷于危机的美国政府，在第一次世界大战期间它充当了英国和法国的财政代理人，并且在战后在草拟道威斯计划中起了重大的作用。摩根公司对美国金融界、企业界以至政府的影响是这样大，以至“对美国人说来，事实上没有什么可以比摩根的名字更能象征金融的权力和浩大”，而摩根自己则认为“他是可以同美国总统平起平坐的”（新闻周刊）。
    但是这些报刊指出，在最近一些年里，所向无敌的摩根财团的地位已经发生了一些变化，它正在受到其他财团，特别是洛克菲勒财团的严重竞争。这首先表现在摩根财团同洛克菲勒财团的经济实力对比的迅速变化上。据最近发表的统计，摩根财团所控制的各个大企业的资产总额是六百五十四亿美元，比洛克菲勒财团的六百一十四亿美元还多四十亿美元。但是从发展来看，由于洛克菲勒财团通过石油投资和对不发达国家无孔不入的掠夺获得了惊人的利润，它的势力的增长却大大超过了摩根财团。总计在二十五年前，摩根财团的资产为洛克菲勒财团的两倍，而现在二者却几乎相等。在这种情况下，洛克菲勒财团在一些方面仍然同摩根集团勾结，但是另一方面毫不放松对摩根财团进攻的机会。在1955年，洛克菲勒的大通银行就宣布同曼哈顿银行进行美国银行业历史上最大的一次合并，直接威胁到摩根的势力。当时摩根的银行业信托公司虽然马上宣布同公共国民银行和信托公司合并以示还击，但看来这并没有能够改变这两个财团力量对比的转变。
    摩根财团在左右美国政府方面也受到洛克菲勒财团的挑战，虽然它们在美国外交政策和内政措施的许多方面还是一个鼻孔出气的。现在美国政府中像国务卿杜勒斯和商务部长斯特劳斯等人都是洛克菲勒的代理人，在决定政策时，洛克菲勒已有更大的发言权，并且意见同摩根财团时有出入。而自从纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在去年年底当选纽约州州长以后，洛克菲勒家族对美国总统宝座的野心已成了众所周知的事实。美国一些刊物指出，在过去，美国历届总统，像格兰特、克利夫兰、老罗斯福、威尔逊等人都是由摩根集团挑选的，但后来由于洛克菲勒势力的增长，最近一些年来白宫的主人在更大的程度上就要得到洛克菲勒财团的支持才能当选了。
    正是在洛克菲勒财团咄咄逼人的情况下，摩根财团才决定进行大规模的反扑，而其手段是竭力加强在金融界的力量，扩充主要的制造业。据说，美国电讯公司所以增加股票发行额和提高股息，就是为了想吸收更多的资金来扩充势力，以便更有力地进行竞争，特别是在承揽政府的军事订货方面进行竞争。
    从种种迹象看来，摩根财团所属公司的合并和扩充势力现在还只是一个开始。合众国际社1月21日报道说，摩根财团发言人透露的合并计划的下一步是银行业信托公司同制造商信托公司合并，合并后的组织将拥有六十七亿余美元资产。
