    Daily High Output  Decadal High Output
    Beijing Industrial Front Overfulfills Mid-Ten Day Plan Again
    Dalian Chemical Plant's Average Daily Output Increases by Nearly 200 Tons Compared to January
    Tianjin No. 9 Plumbing Equipment Factory's Pipe Making Workshop Completes Monthly Plan in Eight Days
    (Our Newspaper) News: The drums of the Great Leap Forward on Beijing's industrial front are sounding louder and louder. February's production has achieved consecutive victories, overfulfilling the mid-ten day plan by 8% again. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, as of the 20th, the city has completed 65.4% of its total monthly output value plan.
    After realizing their wishes for a "red opening" after the Spring Festival, the workers of the city's factories and mining enterprises have become even more enthusiastic about production and are determined to strive for red every ten days and red every day. They have launched a comprehensive leap forward competition to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Many units held mobilization and competition rallies after the Spring Festival, immediately sparking challenges and responses, and focused closely on the key issues of their own factories, grasping the weak links to drive a comprehensive leap forward. After holding a mobilization and competition rally, the workers of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory immediately launched a high tide of competition. Within two days, the party branch of the small electronic tube assembly workshop received 125 challenge and response letters from work sections and groups; the quantity and quality of products from each work section and group have seen new leaps forward. Xie Meifen, a worker in the Fourth Work Section, used to have one defective product for every nine electronic tubes she made on average, but now she has improved to one defective product for every 287 tubes she makes; workers in the first process of the Second Shift of the Second Work Section even created a new record on the 17th of making 1,800 electronic tubes without a single defective product. In mid-February, the Beijing Machine Weaving and Dyeing Factory launched a production upsurge focused on making great efforts in technical revolution to improve product quality. They mobilized the masses to formulate and revise the process regulations for the dyeing and yarn dyeing workshops. After discussion by the masses, 65 modification suggestions were put forward, which greatly improved the quality of the products. At the same time, each workshop carefully analyzed the causes of defects, tracked them down, and organized the maintenance workers to use their brains to come up with solutions, taking corresponding measures, thus comprehensively completing the mid-ten day plan, with a significant improvement in product quality. The comprehensive first-class rate of colored yarn has increased from 54% to 93%. The cement mill workers of the Liulihe Cement Plant diligently adjusted and inspected, increasing the hourly output of the cement mill from just over 50 tons to 53 tons. The entire plant completed the mid-ten day production plan more than one day ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 1,500 tons of cement. By the 20th, the Mentougou Coal Mine had overfulfilled the upper and mid-ten day coal production plan by 2,170 tons, with an average daily output of 94 tons of raw coal more than in January.
    Currently, the workers of all factories and mining enterprises are advancing victoriously, continuing to fight hard, and striving to overfulfill the February plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Luda, February 22nd: Workers at the Dalian Chemical Plant are actively tapping the potential of existing equipment and vigorously increasing the production of soda ash. Since the Spring Festival, the average daily output of this factory has increased by nearly 200 tons compared to January.
    Soda ash is the mother of the chemical industry, and it is widely used in metallurgy, papermaking, rubber, glass, and food industries. In order to increase the daily output level and produce more and better soda ash for the country, the workers of the Dalian Chemical Plant are currently carrying out a hot and bustling socialist competition, making great efforts in technical revolution. Many workers in the factory write the high-yield targets and high-yield methods studied by the collective on colorful paper signs, set up arenas, and look for competition opponents. The compressor work section used to be the "bottleneck" in the entire production process, preventing the carbonization towers and other finished product processes from fully realizing their capacity; repair worker Jia Shuluan proposed a suggestion to change the compressor from a single cylinder to a double cylinder in response to this situation. After the initial experiment, the amount of carbon dioxide sent from the compressor to the carbonization tower increased by 50% at once. Four of the factory's 20 compressors have been innovated in a short period of time, and the unit output of soda ash has increased by 25%. At the same time, the deputy secretary of the factory party committee and some section chiefs, department chiefs, and engineering technicians have also been transferred to the soda ash workshop to participate in labor and directly lead the high-yield movement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 22nd: The workers of the pipe making workshop of Tianjin No. 9 Plumbing Equipment Factory, spurred by the production competition, fully completed the entire month's plan on the 14th in just eight days in February, winning first place in the factory.
    The pipe making workshop was a relatively advanced workshop in the factory last year, completing the plan either first or second every month. However, in January this year, other workshops had overfulfilled their production plans by the 22nd, while the pipe making workshop did not complete it until the 28th. All the workers in the workshop held a meeting on January 23rd to discuss this issue. Some workers believed that the task of this workshop in January was 40% larger than in December last year, and it was already a lot of hard work to complete it on time. Some workers disagreed with this view, believing that it was a fact that the task in January was large, but the tasks of other workshops also increased. After analysis and comparison, it was found that other workshops had taken some measures after the task increased; however, the measures of this workshop had not kept up, the technical revolution had not been carried out, and the production efficiency was similar to that of December last year. In addition, some people had complacency and relaxation emotions, so they naturally fell behind. At that time, everyone was determined: to vigorously grasp measures, vigorously carry out technical innovations, complete the February plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and strive for first place in the factory.
    After discussion, the entire workshop was boiling, forming a upsurge where everyone was looking for measures and everyone was engaging in innovation. More than 100 technical innovation suggestions were put forward in four or five days. Old workers Wang Qinglian, Chen Linsen, Zhao Jinzhong, and Li Weixin often studied together to improve the method of bending the nozzle tubes for medical use. In the past, this part was always bent manually, which was slow and the quality was not consistent. They tried four or five times and made a steel tool tire to replace manual bending, and the production efficiency immediately increased by one and a half times. With the increase in measures, all the workers in the workshop launched the competition like dragons and tigers. Initially, worker Liu Baojuan had the highest output of filing tubes, reaching 4.8 kilograms per day. Xiao Shumin only produced 2 kilograms per day, but Xiao Shumin challenged Liu Baojuan, reaching 5 kilograms on the highest day, finally surpassing Liu Baojuan.
    On the morning of February 16th, all the workers in this workshop held another symposium and decided not to be arrogant or impetuous, and to continue to work hard and skillfully in the second half of February, striving to double the entire month's output compared to the plan.

    日日高产  旬旬高产
    北京工业战线中旬计划又超额完成
    大连化工厂平均日产量比一月份提高近二百吨
    天津第九水暖器材厂制管车间八天完成月计划
    本报讯　北京市工业战线跃进的战鼓越擂越响，2月份生产连战连捷，又超额8％完成了中旬计划。据北京市统计局统计，到20日止，全市已完成全月产值计划的65.4％。
    全市各厂矿企业职工在实现了春节后开门红的心愿后，生产热情更加旺盛，决心争取旬旬红，日日红，展开了提高产量、质量、降低成本全面跃进的竞赛热潮。许多单位在春节后开了誓师比武大会，立即掀起了挑战和应战，并且紧紧围绕着自己厂的关键问题，抓紧薄弱环节，带动全面跃进。北京电子管厂职工，在举行誓师比武大会以后，立即掀起了竞赛高潮。小型电子管装配车间党支部在两天内，就收到工段、小组的挑战、应战书一百二十五份；各工段、小组产品的数质量，都有新的跃进。四工段工人谢梅芬，过去平均作九支电子管就出一支返修品，现在已经提高到作二百八十七支才出一支；二工段二班第一工序的工人还在17日创造了作一千八百支电子管没出一支返修品的新纪录。北京市机织印染厂2月中旬掀起了一个大闹技术革命提高产品质量的生产高潮。发动群众制订和修订染场和染纱场的工艺规程，经过群众讨论，提出了六十五项修改意见，大大提高了产品的质量。同时，各车间认真分析了疵点产生的原因，跟踪追击，组织了保全、保养工人人人开动脑筋想办法，采取了相应的措施，因而全面完成了中旬的计划，产品质量也有显著提高，色纱综合正品率已从54％提高到93％。琉璃河水泥厂水泥磨工人勤调整、勤检查，使水泥磨每小时产量由五十吨多一点提高到五十三吨。全厂提前一天多、超额一千五百吨水泥完成中旬生产计划。门头沟煤矿到20日已经超额二千一百七十吨完成上中旬产煤计划，平均日产量比1月份多九十四吨原煤。
    目前各厂矿企业职工，正在乘胜前进，继续奋战，力争超额完成2月份计划。
    新华社旅大22日电　大连化工厂职工积极挖掘现有设备潜力，大力增产纯碱。春节以来，这个厂的平均日产量比1月份提高了将近二百吨。
    碱，是化学工业之母，在冶金、造纸、橡胶、玻璃和食品等工业中有广泛用途。大连化工厂的职工为了提高日产水平，为国家增产更多、更好的纯碱，目前正在开展热火朝天的社会主义竞赛，大闹技术革命。厂里许多工人把集体研究的高产指标、高产办法，都写在五颜六色的纸牌上，摆擂台，找比赛对手。压缩机工段原来是整个生产流程中的“瓶子口”，卡着碳化塔等出成品的工序不能充分发挥能力；修理工贾书銮针对这种情况提出了把压缩机的单缸改为双缸的建议。这个建议经初次实验，压缩机向碳化塔送二氧化碳的量一下子就增加了50％。全厂二十台压缩机中在短时期内已革新了四台，纯碱单位产量提高了25％。同时，厂党委副书记和部分处长、科长、工程技术人员，也在最近下放到制碱车间参加劳动，直接领导高产运动。
    据新华社天津22日电　天津第九水暖器材厂制管车间职工，在生产竞赛中鼓足干劲，2月份只用八天时间在14日就全面完成全月计划，夺得了全厂第一。
    制管车间在去年就是厂里比较先进的车间，每月完成计划不是第一就是第二。但是今年1月份，别的车间在22日都超额完成了生产计划，而制管车间到28日才完成。全车间工人在1月23日开会讨论了这个问题。有的工人认为本车间1月份任务比去年12月份还大40％，能按时完成就算干劲很足了。有些工人不同意这个意见，认为1月份任务大是事实，可是别的车间任务也同样增大了。经过分析、比较，发现别的车间任务增大以后，采取了一些措施；而本车间的措施却没有跟上去，技术革命没有搞起来，生产效率和去年12月份差不多，加上有的人产生自满松懈情绪，自然就落在后面了。当时大家就下定决心：要大抓措施，大搞技术革新，提前十天到十五天完成2月份计划，力争全厂第一。
    经过讨论，全车间沸腾起来了，形成了一个人人找措施、个个搞革新的热潮，四、五天内就提出了一百多项技术革新建议。老工人王清廉、陈林森、赵进忠、李维新四人，常常在一起研究改进制造医疗用喷头管的扳弯的方法。这种零件过去一直是人工扳，扳得慢，质量也不一致。他们试了四、五次，作成功一个铁的工具胎，代替人力扳，生产效率立即提高一倍半。随着措施的增加，全车间工人都生龙活虎般地展开了竞赛。起初，工人刘宝娟做锉管的产量最高，每天达四点八公斤，萧淑敏每天只生产两公斤，可是萧淑敏向刘宝娟挑战，最高的一天达到五公斤，终于超过了刘宝娟。
    2月16日上午，这个车间的全体工人又开了一个座谈会，决定不骄不躁，在2月下半月继续苦干、巧干，力争全月产量比计划翻一番。
