    New Power Plant in Qiannan
    The new thermal power plant with a capacity of 6,000 kilowatts in Duyun City, the capital of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, has begun generating electricity.
    Before liberation, Duyun City never had electric lights. In 1953, a thermal power plant with a capacity of over 100 kilowatts was built here; now, this newly built thermal power plant has been put into production, which can meet the current industrial and civilian needs of Duyun City.

    Universal Locomotive
    Workers at the Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the First Engineering Office of the Xining Railway Bureau, using the method of "ants gnawing at bones," independently designed and manufactured a universal locomotive.
    This universal locomotive runs on narrow-gauge rails with a gauge of 600 millimeters and can pull 120 fully loaded small dump trucks. When running on the highway, it can be attached to a trailer with a capacity of one to one and a half tons. In addition, it can also be used for pumping water (1.5 tons of water per minute) and generating electricity (4 kilowatts); if a boom is installed at its rear end, it can also lift objects weighing 0.3 tons. The minimum speed is 5 kilometers per hour, and the maximum speed can reach 70 kilometers per hour.

    Extracting Treasures from Rice Husks
    The Shanghai Chemical Plant has recently used indigenous methods to extract a variety of treasures from rice husks (the hulls left over after milling rice). These include furfural (a major raw material for manufacturing plastics), glass fertilizer, white carbon black, water glass, high-grade glass, silicon dioxide, and lightweight insulating refractory bricks.
    The economic value of comprehensive utilization of rice husks using indigenous methods is very high. One ton of rice husks, worth several yuan, increases in value to more than 2,000 yuan if only 30% white carbon black is made from burning rice husks into rice husk ash.
    The indigenous rice husk comprehensive utilization experimental workshop built by the Shanghai Chemical Plant is very suitable for promotion in rural areas.

    黔南的新电厂
    黔南布依族苗族自治州首府都匀市新建的装机容量为六千瓩的火力发电厂，已开始发电。
    都匀市在解放以前从来没有电灯。一九五三年，这里建设了一个一百多瓩的火力发电厂；现在，这个新建的火力发电厂投入生产，能够满足都匀市当前工业和民用的需要。
    万能火车头
    西宁铁路局第一工程处机械修造厂职工，用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，自己设计制造成功一台万能火车头。
    这台万能火车头在轨距六百公厘的轻便小钢轨上行驶，可以牵引一百二十辆满载的小土斗车。如在公路上行驶，可附挂一吨至一吨半的拖车。另外，它还可以用来抽水（每分钟抽水一点五吨）、发电（四瓩）；如在它的后端安上吊杆，还可以起吊零点三吨的重物。行驶速度每小时最低为五公里，最高可达七十公里。

    从砻糠中取宝
    上海化工厂最近用土法从砻糠（稻谷碾米后剩余的谷壳）中提炼出了多种宝。其中有糠醛（一种制造塑料的主要原料），玻璃肥料，白炭黑，水玻璃，高级玻璃，二氧化矽，轻质绝缘耐火砖等。
    砻糠用土法进行综合利用的经济价值很高。一吨价值数元的砻糠，仅是烧成糠灰制成百分之三十白炭黑计算，价值就提高到两千多元。
    上海化工厂建设的这座土法砻糠综合利用实验工场，很适宜在农村中推广。
