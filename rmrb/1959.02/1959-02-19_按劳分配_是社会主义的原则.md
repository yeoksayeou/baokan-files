"Distribution According to Labor" is a Socialist Principle
—A Discussion on a Point in Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's Article—
Sa Renxing

After reading Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's article "Further Discussion on Abolishing Bourgeois Right," I feel that the fundamental viewpoint of this article is very problematic. I am writing down a few different opinions to discuss with everyone, including Comrade Zheng Jiqiao.

Wages Under Capitalism
Are Not "Distribution According to Labor"

Is distribution according to labor also practiced in capitalist society? Our answer can only be negative. However, Comrade Zheng Jiqiao says: "In terms of the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages they pay to this or that worker is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, 'how much work, how much money,' either calculated by the labor day or by the quantity of products, more work more pay, less work less pay. This is reflected in the legal right, which is the equality said by the bourgeoisie. Conversely, if viewed from the perspective of legal right, this 'distribution according to labor' method implements the 'equality' principle of bourgeois right."

This is completely wrong. In any case, people cannot interpret the socialist principle of "distribution according to labor" as a remnant of bourgeois right in this way.

Comrade Zheng Jiqiao has overlooked the basic fact that labor power becomes a commodity in capitalist society; he has overlooked the essence of wages under capitalism. Wages under capitalism do not embody any "distribution according to labor," but rather the price of labor power. This issue has long been scientifically resolved by Marx. As a scientific issue, there is no need to discuss it.

Marx said: "Wages (here referring to wages under capitalism—translator's note) are not a portion of the commodity that the worker possesses that he produces. Wages are the portion of the original commodity that the capitalist uses to purchase a certain amount of productive labor." "Wages are the price of a certain commodity, namely labor power." (Both are from Marx's "Wage Labour and Capital," emphasis original) Isn't this very clear? As long as Comrade Zheng Jiqiao acknowledges the fact that labor power becomes a commodity under capitalism, then he must also acknowledge that wages under capitalism are the price of labor power. Since it is the price of labor power, of course it cannot embody "distribution according to labor." The worker's wages are not determined by the standard of the worker's labor, but by another standard, that is, as Marx said, "wages are determined by the laws that determine the prices of all other commodities" (ibid.), or as he said in "Capital," Volume 1, "are determined by the labor-time required to produce this peculiar article (referring to labor-power—translator's note), and consequently to reproduce it." Specifically, it "depends on how much labor-time is required to produce the means of subsistence necessary for the laborer to maintain himself in a state fit for work, and to perpetuate his race." (Engels, "Anti-Dühring")

In short, under capitalism, the value of labor power, this special commodity, like other commodities, is "determined by the labor-time required for production." And wages are the price expression of the value of labor power. The value and price of labor power (i.e., wages) are by no means determined by the value it creates when put into the production process, that is, by his labor. After the worker sells his labor power to the capitalist, the capitalist forces the worker to labor according to his own will, and the value created by the labor has nothing to do with the worker. That is to say, the worker cannot participate in the distribution of the value created by his own labor; he can only obtain the wages he exchanged for selling his labor power in advance.

Therefore, wages under capitalism have nothing to do with "distribution according to labor."

Or, Comrade Zheng Jiqiao says that he is referring to the relationship between individual capitalists and individual workers, as in his words quoted at the beginning of this article. But can the individual and the general be so contradictory? Is the wage paid by an individual capitalist to an individual worker not the price of labor power?

Under capitalism, workers are also "distributed" a little means of subsistence. If we use a formula, it is not "distribution according to labor," but "distribution according to labor power"—

Of course, this is not accurate. To be more accurate, they receive the bare minimum means of subsistence needed to sustain life and perpetuate their offspring, according to the price of labor power.

Capitalism is Distribution "According to Capital"

Comrade Zheng Jiqiao says: Some comrades "believe that the principle of distribution under capitalism is unearned income, more work less gain, and even work without gain. Such an understanding is inaccurate." What is the reason? He says: "It cannot be considered that unearned income, etc., is the principle of distribution in capitalist society. Because it is obvious that not all 'non-laborers' can have 'gain' in capitalist society, only the bourgeoisie, that is, those who own the means of production, can have unearned income."

We do not want to insist on using the expression "unearned income, etc." to express the principle of distribution under capitalism. However, this expression reveals the essence of wealth distribution under capitalism.

"Unearned income, etc." was said by Marx and Engels. In the "Communist Manifesto," they refuted the fallacy that "when private property is destroyed... laziness will prevail" by writing: "According to this, bourgeois society should have long perished from laziness, because here the worker does not gain, and the gainer does not labor." It goes without saying that "here" of course refers to bourgeois society. Here, Marx and Engels are not expressing the principle of distribution under capitalism, but the saying "the worker does not gain, and the gainer does not labor" vividly reveals the actual situation of wealth distribution in capitalist society. Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's reason is very strange. In capitalist society, of course, not all "non-laborers" can have "gain." Rather, the bourgeoisie who occupy the means of production exploit the workers by using the means of production they occupy. But doesn't this precisely show that the bourgeoisie has "unearned income," while the other side—the proletariat—"labors without gain"? The bourgeoisie's "unearned income" is predicated on the proletariat's "labor without gain." If everyone had "unearned income," what would they "gain"? Is that even conceivable? Perhaps, workers "gain" wages, so how can it be said that they "labor without gain"? In essence, it should be said that they "labor without gain" because the wages workers receive are the price of their labor power, and they are completely detached from the fruits created by their labor.

Comrade Zheng Jiqiao quoted Marx: "Any distribution of the means of consumption is at all times only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves." If Comrade Zheng Jiqiao thinks carefully about this sentence, he will understand that the principles of distribution in socialism and capitalism cannot be the same. Because in these two societies, the "distribution of the conditions of production themselves" is different (one is public ownership, the other is capitalist private ownership), and the distribution of the means of consumption "is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves"! If Comrade Zheng Jiqiao quoted Marx's words in full, then it would be easy to understand what the principle of distribution under capitalism is, but that would be exactly the opposite of his view. Now we quote it in full.

"Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. The latter, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of non-workers in the form of capital ownership and land ownership, while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labor power. If the elements of production are distributed in this way, then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically. If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves, then this will result in a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present day." ("Critique of the Gotha Program." Emphasis added by the translator)

Here, according to Marx's principles, we discuss with Comrade Zheng Jiqiao from the following aspects.

(1) According to Marx's point of view, the distribution of the means of consumption "is a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves." Is there a significant difference in the distribution of the conditions of production between socialist and capitalist societies? Of course, there is a significant difference. Socialist society is based on public ownership of the means of production, while capitalist society is based on capitalist ownership of the means of production. Comrade Zheng Jiqiao certainly acknowledges this. Then, since the distribution of the conditions of production is fundamentally different between socialist and capitalist societies, why can the distribution of the means of consumption, which is a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production, not be fundamentally different?

(2) Marx also clearly pointed out that due to the fundamental difference in the distribution of the conditions of production, the distribution of the means of consumption in socialism and capitalism is also fundamentally different. He clearly said: "If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves, then this will result in a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present day." This means that once the capitalist ownership of the means of production is eliminated, its principle of distribution of the means of consumption is also eliminated; with the realization of public ownership of the means of production, a principle of distribution of the means of consumption that is "different from the present day," that is, different from capitalist distribution, is generated. That is: "distribution according to labor" in its primary stage; "distribution according to need" in its advanced stage.

From the above, it can be seen that Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's argument is untenable: "The fundamental difference between this society (note: referring to socialist society) and capitalist society does not lie in 'distribution according to labor' itself, but in the most fundamental change in the social system, that is, ownership." We believe that the fundamental difference between the two lies not only in the most fundamental difference in ownership, but also in the different principles of distribution due to the difference in ownership. When ownership changes, the principle of distribution of the means of consumption, which is a consequence of ownership, cannot but change.

(3) According to Marx's principles, the question of what the principle of distribution under capitalism is (not only the distribution of the means of consumption) becomes clear. In capitalist society, the factors (or conditions) of production are distributed in this way: the means of production (land, machines, raw materials, etc.) are controlled by the capitalists; workers are completely separated from the means of production, and they can only engage in labor production by selling their labor power. The consequence of this distribution of the conditions of production is: on the one hand, the working class has no right to participate in the distribution of wealth accumulation, simply because they have no capital. They can only sell their labor power and obtain wages according to market prices. On the other hand, industrial and agricultural capitalists, commercial capitalists, bank bosses, and landlords divide up the surplus value according to the amount of means of production they occupy. Therefore, we say that the standard of capitalist distribution of wealth accumulation is the occupation of the means of production. The working class has no right to participate in the distribution because it does not occupy the means of production. In short, capitalist society is distribution "according to capital."

"Distribution According to Labor" is the Principle of Distribution in Socialism

"Distribution according to labor" is the principle of distribution in socialism, and it is a negation of the principle of distribution in capitalism. It abolishes "distribution according to capital," which goes without saying. Here, it is necessary to talk about wages under socialism. Wages are the main form of implementing "distribution according to labor." However, it is fundamentally different from wages under capitalism. First, labor power is no longer a commodity; hence, second, wages are no longer the price of labor power. Therefore, (1) the average wage is no longer "determined by how much labor-time is required to produce the means of subsistence necessary for the laborer to maintain himself in a state fit for work, and to perpetuate his race"; but is determined by the level of social production. When production increases, wages also increase accordingly. Socialist production is for the purpose of meeting the people's ever-growing material and cultural needs. (2) The labor of the laborers is no longer separated from their labor results. For individual laborers, more work means more pay (wages); for social accumulation, this is increasing the wealth of public ownership, which is a means to better develop socialist production and also to improve the living standards of laborers. Here, each member can only provide labor to society. Society uses labor as a measure to distribute the means of consumption to each member.

Therefore, we say: wages under capitalism are the price of labor power; while wages under socialism embody "distribution according to labor." We must never confuse them because of their formal similarity.

Comrade Zheng Jiqiao says: If we say that "distribution according to labor" is the negation of the principle of distribution in capitalism, "then when the principle of 'distribution according to need' is implemented in the communist stage, it is the... negation of the negation of the principle of distribution in capitalism, and it is obviously inappropriate to say that." In his view, "distribution according to labor" is not socialist, but the principle of distribution in capitalism. This leads to a very strange conclusion: the only difference between socialist society and capitalist society is ownership, while the distribution system is the same; it is said that the difference between socialist society and communist society lies in the fact that the principle of distribution in socialism is capitalist. Isn't this absurd? Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's reason is to apply the formula of negation of the negation. This chaotic logical reason is untenable. The formula of negation of the negation cannot be applied indiscriminately. The "negation of the negation" that Comrade Zheng Jiqiao himself deduced, like saying that feudal society is the negation of the negation of primitive society, and socialist society is the negation of the negation of feudal society, is untenable. It is true that "distribution according to need" is the negation of "distribution according to labor"; but they are both negations of the principle of distribution in capitalism. The capitalist principle of distribution is "according to capital," which is neither "according to labor" nor "according to need." Here, the negation of the negation is related to and consistent with the negation of the negation of primitive society by communism (including its lower and higher stages). People cannot arbitrarily extract a section from the overall process, mix the small stage and the large stage together, and apply the formula of negation of the negation indiscriminately.

We say that "distribution according to labor" is a socialist principle, of course, it does not deny that it is a remnant of bourgeois right. It is both a socialist principle and a remnant of bourgeois right, which is not self-contradictory.

We call the socialist principle of "distribution according to labor" a remnant of bourgeois right, simply because "what prevails here is the same principle that regulates commodity exchange," that is, "the distribution of consumer goods among the individual producers... is governed by the same principle as prevails in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form" ("Critique of the Gotha Program"). Therefore, "distribution according to labor" has inequality for unequal laborers in the enjoyment of the right to consumer goods on this equal right of laborers. In capitalist society, there is only an equivalent exchange between commodities, including the equivalence of wages and labor power; but there is no equivalence between wages and labor, that is, there is no "distribution according to labor." The equality of bourgeois right is a reflection of the principle of equivalent exchange, and its hypocrisy is the reflection of the inequivalence of wages and labor under the cover of the equivalence of wages and labor power. Therefore, it is said that the principle and practice are contradictory there. "Distribution according to labor," however, realizes the equivalence of income and labor, that is, "the amount of labor he has given to society in one form he receives back in another form" ("Critique of the Gotha Program"). Of course, in terms of wages, it deducts the labor he has performed for the social fund, but this part is publicly owned, and he also has a share. Precisely because of this, it is said that "principle and practice are no longer in contradiction here." Marx said, "this equal right is still stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation" ("Critique of the Gotha Program". Emphasis added by the translator. The original text has emphasis under "equal right"). This aspect refers to the principle that regulates commodity exchange still playing a role here; but it is by no means regarding "distribution according to labor" and the principle of distribution in capitalism as one and the same. We have already expressed our opinions on this issue in "On Eliminating Bourgeois Right Ideology" (published in "Philosophical Research" No. 7, 1958), so we will not say more here.

    “按劳分配”是社会主义的原则
    ——关于郑季翘同志文章中一个论点的商榷——
    撒仁兴
    读了郑季翘同志的文章“再谈削除资产阶级法权”，觉得这篇文章的根本观点是很成问题的。现将几点不同的意见写出来，和大家也和郑季翘同志讨论。
    资本主义制度下的工资
    不是“按劳分配”
    在资本主义社会里也是按劳分配吗？我们的答复，只能是否定的。但是，郑季翘同志却说：“就资本家与工人的直接关系来说，他们付给这个工人或那个工人多少工资，原则上则是以工人的劳动为尺度，即‘做多少活，给多少钱’，或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给。这一点反映在法权上，就是资产阶级所说的平等。反过来，如果以法权观点来看，这种‘按劳分配’的办法是贯彻了资产阶级法权‘平等’原则的。”
    这是完全不对的。无论如何，人们不能这样来解释“按劳分配”这个社会主义原则是资产阶级法权残余。
    郑季翘同志忽略了在资本主义社会里，劳动力变成了商品这一基本事实；忽略了资本主义制度下工资的实质。资本主义制度下的工资，并不体现什么“按劳分配”，而是劳动力的价格。这个问题，是马克思早已科学地解决了的。作为一个科学上的问题，本来是没有必要进行讨论的。
    马克思说：“工资（这里是指资本主义制度下的工资——引者注）不是工人在他所生产的商品中占有的一份。工资乃是原有商品中由资本家用以购买一定量生产劳动力的那一部分。”“工资乃是一定商品即劳动力的价格。”（均见马克思“雇佣劳动与资本”，着重点是原有的）这不是非常明白吗？郑季翘同志只要承认在资本主义制度下劳动力变为商品这一事实，那末，他也就必须承认，资本主义制度下的工资是劳动力的价格。既然是劳动力的价格，当然它不能是体现“按劳分配”的。工人的工资，不是由工人的劳动这个尺度所决定的，而是由另外一个尺度所决定的，即马克思所说的“工资是由那些决定着其他一切商品价格的法则决定的”（同上），或者如他在“资本论”第一卷中所说的，“是由这种特殊物品（指劳动力——引者注）的生产，因之也就是其再生产所必需的劳动时间来决定的”。具体来说，就是“要看劳动者为着维持自己能够劳动的状态以及为着传种接代起见所必须的生活资料之生产需要多少劳动时间来决定。”（恩格斯语，见“反杜林论”）
    总之，在资本主义制度下，劳动力这个特殊商品，和其他商品一样，它的价值是由“生产所必需的劳动时间来决定的”。而工资就是劳动力这个商品的价值的价格表现。劳动力的价值、价格（即工资），绝不是由它投入生产过程所创造的价值，即他的劳动所决定的。当工人把劳动力出卖给资本家以后，资本家就按照他自己的意愿迫使工人进行劳动，劳动所创造的价值与工人毫不相干。也就是说，工人并不能参与他自己劳动所创造的价值的分配，他只能事先获得他出卖劳动力所换来的工资。
    因此，资本主义制度下的工资，和“按劳分配”也是毫不相干的。
    或者，郑季翘同志说，他是就个别资本家和个别工人的关系而言，如本文开头所引的他的话。但是，个别与一般能够这样背道而驰吗？难道个别资本家付给个别工人的工资，不是劳动力的价格吗？
    在资本主义制度下，工人也被“分配”到一点生活资料，如果套公式的话，那么不是什么“按劳分配”，而是“按劳动力分配”——
  当然，这并不确切，确切一点说是：他们按照劳动力的价格得到仅能维持生命和延续后代的最低限度的生活资料。
    资本主义是“按资”分配
    郑季翘同志说：有的同志“认为资本主义的分配原则是不劳而获，多劳少获，甚至劳而不获。这样的认识是不确切的。”有什么理由呢？他说：“不能认为不劳而获等等，是资本主义社会的分配原则。因为，很显然在资本主义社会并不是所有的‘不劳者’都可以有‘获’，仅仅是资产阶级即拥有生产资料的人才可以不劳而获。”
    我们并不想坚持一定要以“不劳而获等等”说法，来表述资本主义的分配原则。但是，这个说法却是揭露了资本主义的财富分配的实质。
  “不劳而获等等”是马克思和恩格斯说的。他们在“共产党宣言”里，驳斥“私有财产权一旦消灭的时候……懒惰之风就会盛行起来”这种谬论时写道：“照这样说来，那末资产阶级社会应该是老早就因懒惰而灭亡了，因为这里是劳者不获，获者不劳的。”不言而喻，所谓“这里”当然是指的资产阶级社会。在这里，马克思和恩格斯虽然不是表述资本主义的分配原则，但是“劳者不获，获者不劳”这个说法，却是形象地揭出了资本主义社会财富分配的实际情形。郑季翘同志的理由是很奇怪的。在资本主义社会里，当然不是所有的“不劳者”都能有“获”的。而是占有生产资料的资产阶级，借它所占有的生产资料剥削工人。可是，这不正是说明资产阶级一方“不劳而获”，另一方——无产阶级“劳而不获”吗？资产阶级“不劳而获”，正是以无产阶级的“劳而不获”为前提的。如果大家都“不劳而获”，还“获”个什么呢？难道那是可以设想的吗？也许说，工人“获”有工资，怎能说“劳而不获”呢？就实质上，应该说是“劳而不获”，因为工人所得的工资，是他们出卖劳动力的价格，他们与自己劳动创造的果实是完全脱离关系的。
    郑季翘同志引了马克思的话：“消费品的任何一种分配，始终不过是生产条件本身分配的后果。”郑季翘同志如果好好思索一下这句话，他就会了解，社会主义和资本主义的分配原则是不能相同的。因为在这两种社会里，“生产条件本身分配”是不同的（一个是公有制，一个是资本主义的私有制），而消费品的分配“不过是生产条件本身分配的后果”啊！如果郑季翘同志把马克思的话引全，那么资本主义的分配原则是什么，也就容易弄清楚了，不过那恰好和他的看法相反。现在我们把它引全。
    “消费品的任何一种分配，始终只不过是生产条件本身分配的后果。而生产条件的分配，则表现生产方式本身的性质。例如，资本主义生产方式的基础就在于：以资本私有制和土地私有制为其形式的物质的生产条件，掌握在不劳动者的手中，而人民大众则只有人身的生产条件，即劳动力。既然生产的要素是这样分配的，那也就要自然而然产生出现代的消费品分配。如果物质的生产条件将是工人自己的集体财产，那么结果也就要产生出跟现代不同的消费品分配。”（“哥达纲领批判”。着重点是引者加的）
    这里，我们根据马克思的原则，从以下几方面和郑季翘同志进行讨论。
      （一）按照马克思的观点，消费品的分配，“是生产条件本身分配的后果”。社会主义社会和资本主义社会，生产条件的分配是否有重大区别呢？当然有重大区别，社会主义社会是生产资料公有制，资本主义社会是生产资料资本主义所有制。这一点，郑季翘同志当然是承认的。那么，社会主义社会和资本主义社会，既然生产条件的分配根本不同，为什么作为生产条件分配后果的消费品的分配，能够没有根本的区别呢？
    （二）马克思也明明指出，由于生产条件的分配的根本区别，社会主义和资本主义的消费品的分配，也是根本不同的。他明明说：“如果物质的生产条件将是工人自己的集体财产，那么结果也要出现跟现代不同的消费品分配。”这也就是说：一旦消灭了生产资料的资本主义所有制，也就消灭了它的消费品分配的原则；随着实现生产资料公有制，也就产生出“跟现代不同的”，即跟资本主义分配不同的消费品分配原则。这就是：在它的初级阶段“按劳分配”；在它的高级阶段“按需分配”。
    由以上所说可见，郑季翘同志的这个论点是站不住的：“这个社会（按：指社会主义社会）所以和资本主义社会根本不同，不在于‘按劳分配’本身，而在于社会制度中最根本的即所有制的改变。”我们认为：两者的根本不同，固然最根本的在于所有制的不同，但是也在于因所有制不同而分配原则不同。所有制改变了，作为所有制后果的消费品分配原则，是不能不改变的。
      （三）根据马克思的原则，资本主义的分配原则（不仅是消费品的分配）是什么这个问题，也就了然了。资本主义社会，生产要素（或条件）是这样分配的：生产资料（土地、机器、原料等等）掌握在资本家手里；工人和生产资料完全脱离，他们只有把自己的劳动力出卖，才能进行劳动生产。生产条件的这种分配的后果，就是：一方面，工人阶级没有参与财富增殖的分配的权利，就因为他们没有资本。他们只能出卖劳动力，按照市场价格，获得工资。另一方面，是工农业资本家、商业资本家、银行老板以及地主，按照他们占有生产资料的多少，来瓜分剩余价值。因此，我们说，资本主义分配财富增殖的尺度是生产资料的占有，工人阶级就因为没有占有生产资料，所以没有参与分配的权利。简言之就是：资本主义社会是“按资”分配。
    “按劳分配”是社会主义的分配原则
    “按劳分配”是社会主义的分配原则，是对资本主义分配原则的否定。它废除了“按资分配”，这是不用多说的了。这里倒是需要说一说社会主义制度下的工资。工资是实行“按劳分配”的主要形式。但是，它和资本主义制度下的工资是根本不同的。第一，劳动力再也不是商品；因之，第二，工资再也不是劳动力的价格。所以（一）平均工资，再也不是由“劳动者为着维持自己能够劳动的状态以及为着传种接代起见所必须的生活资料之生产需要多少劳动时间来决定”；而是由社会生产水平所决定。生产提高了，工资也就相应的提高。社会主义生产，就是为着满足人们日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要。（二）劳动者的劳动，再也不是和他们的劳动成果相脱离的了。就个别劳动者来说，是多劳多得（工资）；就社会积累来说，这是增殖公共所有的财富，这是为了更好地发展社会主义生产，也是提高劳动者生活水平的一种手段。在这里，每个成员所能供给社会的只是劳动。社会对每个成员，都是以劳动为尺度，分配消费品。
    因此，我们说：资本主义制度下的工资，是劳动力的价格；而社会主义制度下的工资，则是体现“按劳分配”。我们决不能因其形式相似，而把它们混同起来。
    郑季翘同志说：如果说“按劳分配”是资本主义分配原则的否定，“那末，到了共产主义阶段实行‘按需分配’的分配原则时，便是资本主义分配原则的……否定的否定了，而这样说，显然是不妥当的。”在他看来，“按劳分配”不是社会主义的，而是资本主义的分配原则。由此引出了一个很奇怪的结论：社会主义社会与资本主义社会不同的只是所有制，而分配制度则是一个东西；据说社会主义社会和共产主义社会的区别，在于社会主义的分配原则是资本主义的。这难道不是很荒谬的吗？郑季翘同志据为理由的是套否定的否定公式。这种混乱的逻辑上的理由，是不能成立的。否定的否定这个公式是不能乱套的。郑季翘同志自己引出的“否定的否定”，如同说封建社会是原始社会的否定的否定、社会主义社会是封建社会的否定的否定一样，是不能成立的。不错，“按需分配”是“按劳分配”的否定；但它们又都是对资本主义分配原则的否定。资本主义分配原则是“按资”，它既不“按劳”，又不“按需”。这里的否定的否定，是同共产主义（包括它的低级阶段和高级阶段）对原始社会的否定的否定，相联系、相一致的。人们不能从总的过程中，随便截取一段，把小阶段和大阶段混在一起，乱套否定的否定这个公式。
    我们说，“按劳分配”是社会主义原则，当然并不否认它是资产阶级法权残余。它是社会主义原则，又是资产阶级法权残余，这并不是自相矛盾。
    我们把“按劳分配”的社会主义原则，叫作资产阶级法权残余，简单地说来，就是因为“这里通行的就是那个调节商品交换的原则”，即“消费品在各个生产者中间的分配，……通行着在商品等价物的交换里也通行的那个原则，即一种形态的一定数量的劳动可以与另一种形态的同量劳动交换”（“哥达纲领批判”）。因此“按劳分配”对于劳动者的这个平等权利上就存在着不同等的劳动者在享受消费品权利上的不平等。在资本主义社会里，只是在商品之间存在着等价交换，包括工资和劳动力的等价；但是却没有什么工资和劳动的等价，也就是说没有什么“按劳分配”。资产阶级法权的平等是等价交换原则的反映，而它的虚伪性，则是工资和劳动力等价掩盖下的工资和劳动不等价的反映。所以说，在那里原则和实践是相互矛盾的。“按劳分配”，却是实现了所得和劳动的等价，即“他以一种形态给与社会的劳动量，又以另一种形态全部取回来”（“哥达纲领批判”）。当然，就工资说，扣除了他为社会基金而进行的劳动，但是这一部分为公共所有，也有他的一份。正因为这样，所以说“原则和实践在这里已不再互相矛盾”。马克思是说，“按劳分配”“这个平等权利有一方面还仍然受资产阶级范围的限制”（“哥达纲领批判”。着重点是引者加的。原文在“平等的权利”下有着重点）。这一方面，就是指的在这里起作用的还是调节商品交换的原则；而决不是把“按劳分配”和资本主义的分配原则看作一个东西。对于这个问题，我们在“论破除资产阶级法权观念”（载“哲学研究”1958年第7期）一文里已经发表了意见，这里就不多说了。
