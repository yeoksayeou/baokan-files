    The Soviet Union is Vigorously Developing the Chemical Industry
    By Dai Feng, Staff Reporter

    Whether in the snowy expanse of Siberia, or in the warm and sunny Azerbaijan; whether in the frigid, frozen Volga River midstream area, or in the boundless grasslands of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, a moving picture of the flourishing construction of chemical industrial enterprises can be seen everywhere.
    Not long ago, hundreds and thousands of Communist Youth League members and young people from all over the Soviet Union, answering the call to “support the chemical industry,” went to construction sites in batches. The chemical industry has been listed as the most important project in the entire industrial development of the Soviet Union, and has a decisive impact on the technological progress of the entire Soviet national economy. The development speed of the Soviet national economy and the further rise of people's living standards depend to a large extent on the development of the chemical industry.

          A Brief Review

    The Soviet chemical industry became an independent production system during the first Five-Year Plan period. Before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia basically had no chemical industry. The Soviet regime inherited a pitifully small chemical industry. By 1921, there were fewer than 15,000 workers engaged in chemical industrial production, producing only more than 40,000 tons of basic chemical acids and alkalis annually.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the development of the chemical industry. Even during the first Five-Year Plan period, despite the financial and technical difficulties at the time, the government mobilized a large amount of manpower and financial resources to build more than 70 modern chemical factories, including factories for mineral fertilizers, basic chemicals, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubber. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to successfully start producing synthetic rubber, and is therefore known as the "birthplace of synthetic rubber."
    The Great Patriotic War interrupted the large-scale development of the chemical industry. Some chemical factories in Ukraine, Donbass and other regions where the Soviet chemical industry was located were destroyed and reduced to rubble. Compared with the pre-war period, the national production of nitrous acid was reduced by 50%, sulfuric acid by 77%, and alkali by 83%. Other chemical industries were also damaged and reduced in production to varying degrees.
    After the war, the Soviet Union began to vigorously restore and develop the chemical industry. And in a very short period of time, it established almost all modern chemical industry sectors. At present, the total output of the Soviet chemical industry has increased 115 times compared with 1913, ranking second in the world only to the United States. In the past 20 years, the output of the Soviet chemical industry has increased six times, while the United States has only increased 3.1 times, the United Kingdom two times, France 1.3 times, and West Germany 1.1 times. The development speed of the Soviet chemical industry far exceeds that of capitalist countries. In the future, the Soviet Union will rapidly catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries, and become the world's number one.
    In order to further develop production and improve the needs of people's lives, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convened a Central Plenary Session last May, specifically to discuss the issue of vigorously developing the chemical industry, and made corresponding resolutions. The Seven-Year Plan from 1959 to 1965 stipulates that the chemical industry should have new and significant development. The state's investment in this area exceeds the investment in the metallurgical industry, which puts the Soviet chemical industry on a new stage of development.

      Synthetic Materials Take the Lead

    The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that in order to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, a strong synthetic fiber industry and plastics industry will be established first. During the Seven-Year Plan period, the total output of chemical products will increase by approximately two times. The production of chemical fibers will increase by 2.8 to 3 times, of which the most valuable synthetic fibers will increase by 11 to 13 times, and the production of plastics and synthetic resins will increase by 5.7 times.
    Why is the development of synthetic materials placed in the primary position in the development of the chemical industry? This is because there is hardly any industrial, transportation, and agricultural sector whose development can be without synthetic materials. What people wear, use, live in, and eat are all closely related to the production of synthetic materials. In addition, synthetic material products are cheap and beautiful. For example, one cubic meter of wood can be made into 160 kilograms of rayon, which can be used to weave 1,500 meters of silk. If natural textile fibers are to be used to weave the same amount of silk, then one million silkworm cocoons, or cotton produced on half a hectare of land, would be needed.
    Statistics show that the average increase in silk fabrics produced in the Soviet Union from 1913 to 1957, a period of forty-four years, was 20 meters per person. However, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, the average amount of silk fabrics per person should be 56 meters, an increase of 17 meters compared to 1958. The rapid increase in silk fabric production within seven years is mainly due to the rapid increase in synthetic fibers. For example, in 1965, 1.485 billion meters of silk fabric will be produced, of which 1.237 billion meters will come from rayon and synthetic fibers. During this period, the production of synthetic fiber knitwear will also increase eightfold. The output of artificial lambskin in 1965 will increase from 300,000 meters in 1957 to 5 million meters, equivalent to 340,000 real animal skins. The production of other artificial leather will also be greatly developed.
    Plastics also play an increasingly important role in the development of the national economy. The Soviet Union's plastics industry was established in the 1930s. Today, the Soviet Union has produced more than 2,000 kinds of plastic products, and more than half of the total plastic production is used in the machinery manufacturing industry. The Tu-104 jet airliner alone uses 120,000 parts made of plastic and plexiglass.
    The increasing use of plastics is not only due to its many properties that are not found in general natural materials and metals, but also because its production cost is lower, which has tremendous economic value. According to calculations, from 1959 to 1965, the 100,000 tons of plastic used in the automobile industry alone can save the country 5,000 tons of non-ferrous metals and 200,000 tons of steel, saving nearly 1 billion rubles.

      The Key to Agricultural Increase

    In recent years, the development of Soviet socialist agriculture has been at a new high tide. The Central Plenary Session of the CPSU held last December determined new tasks for the further development of agricultural production in the future. At present, the most urgent task for increasing agricultural production in the Soviet Union is to increase the yield per unit area of all crops. Fertilizers play a very important role in achieving this task.
    The Soviet Union's mineral fertilizer production was established during the first Five-Year Plan period. The reporter recently visited the Voskresensk Fertilizer Factory, one of the three large chemical fertilizer plants built during the first Five-Year Plan period.
    Factory Director Doktorov said when talking about the relationship between chemical fertilizers and agricultural production increase, the large-scale increase in chemical fertilizer production can not only increase the production of large quantities of grains and other crops, but also further reduce agricultural labor, reduce production costs, and save expenses.
    According to statistics, before 1949, the average amount of mineral fertilizer applied to each hectare of cotton field in the Soviet Union was only 5 quintals. At that time, the harvest was only 15 to 16 quintals of seed cotton per hectare. After 1950, due to the large-scale development of mineral fertilizer production, the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields each year increased significantly. At present, the average amount of mineral fertilizer applied to each hectare of cotton field has reached 9.5 quintals, resulting in a yield of 20 to 22 quintals of seed cotton per hectare.
    Factory Director Doktorov also specifically introduced to us the relationship between various fertilizers and the increase in agricultural product production. He said that using one ton of nitrogen fertilizer can increase potato production by 120 tons, beet production by 120 to 160 tons, wheat and oat production by 15 to 20 tons, and seed cotton production by 10 to 12 tons. If one ton of phosphorus pentoxide is used as fertilizer, it can increase beet production by 50 to 55 tons, potato production by 40 to 50 tons, and wheat and oat production by 20 tons. Mineral fertilizers can also improve the quality of agricultural products, increasing the sugar content of beets and grapes, the starch in potatoes, and the protein in grains.
    The widespread use of mineral fertilizers in grain production not only increases yield, but also reduces labor by 40% and product costs by about 20%.
    Therefore, in the vigorous development of the chemical industry, the industry that produces mineral fertilizers and various pesticides has received great attention. New chemical fertilizer factories will be built in batches. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that mineral fertilizer production should be doubled, that is, 31 million tons should be produced annually by 1965.

      New Factories Are Scattered Like Stars

    In order to complete the chemical industry production increase tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, in addition to further increasing production in existing chemical industrial enterprises, 140 new modern chemical industrial enterprises will be built throughout the Soviet Union. All 130 old chemical factories will be completely renovated. For this reason, the state's basic investment in the development of the chemical industry amounts to 100 billion to 105 billion rubles. The plan stipulates that about half of the entire appropriation for the development of the chemical industry will be used to build enterprises that produce plastics, artificial fibers and synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, and alcohol.
    The Soviet Union has sufficient resources to ensure the completion of the huge new tasks put forward in the development of the chemical industry in the next seven years. The Soviet Union has the world's leading reserves of raw materials necessary for chemical industry production, such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, and wood. In recent years, many new mining areas with rich reserves of petroleum and natural gas have been discovered in the Tatar Autonomous Republic, the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, the Volga River Basin, Siberia, and Azerbaijan. This provides a reliable and solid material basis for the extensive development of the chemical industry.
    The large-scale chemical enterprises built by the Soviet Union are all located close to raw material bases. New enterprises producing synthetic rubber will be built in Krasnoyarsk. Within seven years, synthetic fiber factories there will produce new products such as Kapron, Nitron, and Lavsan in large quantities. A series of factories producing plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, and polymer raw materials have already begun to be built in the Stalingrad, Kuibyshev, and Saratov regions along the Volga River. The first phase of the synthetic alcohol plant in New Kuibyshev has been put into production. This factory uses by-products from local oil refineries to process and manufacture hundreds of thousands of liters of alcohol. Near the city of Stavropol, near the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, construction of a modern large-scale factory producing synthetic rubber has begun in full swing. Countless chemical industrial enterprises have begun to be established within the territory of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, the Tatar Autonomous Republic, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. A largest pulp joint factory will be built in the Komi Autonomous Republic, producing large quantities of pulp, paperboard, plywood, wood fiberboard, feed yeast, and so on. At the same time, in order to supply the large amount of modern technical equipment needed for the construction and renovation of chemical factories throughout the Soviet Union, several chemical machinery manufacturing plants are being built.
    The completion of the Soviet Union's huge chemical industry development plan will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the development of the Soviet Union's national economy, in meeting the people's needs in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and in the Soviet Union catching up with the United States in terms of per capita consumption of textiles, clothing, footwear, and other consumer goods.

    苏联正在大力发展化学工业
    本报记者　戴枫
    不论在积雪辽阔的西伯利亚，还是在风和日暖的阿塞拜疆；不论在严寒封冻的伏尔加河中游地区，还是在广阔无边的哈萨克斯坦和乌克兰草原，一幅欣欣向荣的兴建化学工业企业的动人图景，到处可见。
    不久前，全苏各地“支援化学工业”的成百上千个共青团员和青年们，分批前往建设工地。化学工业已被列为苏联整个工业发展中最重要的项目，对苏联整个国民经济的技术进步具有决定性的影响。苏联国民经济的发展速度和人民生活水平的进一步高涨，在颇大程度上取决于化学工业的发展。
          简短的回顾
    苏联的化学工业在苏联第一个五年计划期间，就成为独立的生产系统。十月革命前，沙皇俄国基本上没有化学工业。苏维埃政权所接收到的化学工业少得可怜。到1921年时，从事化学工业生产的工人还不到一万五千人，全年只不过生产四万多吨基本化学酸、碱而已。
    苏联共产党一直非常重视化学工业的发展。还在第一个五年计划期间，尽管当时在资金与技术方面都十分困难，政府还是动员大批人力与财力建设起了七十多个现代化化学工厂、其中包括矿物肥料、基本化学、合成纤维、合成橡胶等工厂。苏联是世界上第一个成功地开始生产合成橡胶的国家，因而被称为“合成橡胶故乡之国”。
    卫国战争中断了化学工业的大规模发展。苏联化学工业所在的乌克兰、顿巴斯等地区的一些化工厂被毁得只剩下一片瓦砾。与战前相比，当时，全国亚硝酸减产50％、硫酸减产77％、碱减产83％。其他化学工业也在不同程度上遭到破坏和减产。
    战后苏联着手大力恢复和发展化学工业。并在极短的时间就建立起了几乎所有现代化学工业部门。目前，苏联化学工业的总产量比1913年增加了一百一十五倍，仅次于美国而居世界第二位。最近二十年来，苏联的化学工业产量增长六倍，而美国只有三点一倍、英国二倍、法国一点三倍、西德一点一倍。苏联化学工业的发展速度大大超过资本主义国家。今后苏联将会迅速赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家，跃居世界第一位。
    为了进一步发展生产和提高人民生活的需要，苏联共产党在去年5月召开了中央全会，专门讨论了大力发展化学工业的问题，并作出了相应的决议。1959年到1965年的七年计划，规定化学工业要有新的巨大发展。国家在这方面的投资超过了冶金工业投资，这就使苏联化学工业走上了一个新的发展阶段。
      合成材料一马当先
    七年计划规定，为了加速化学工业的发展，将首先建立强大的合成纤维工业和塑料工业。七年计划期间，化学产品的总产量约将增加两倍。化学纤维的生产增加二点八倍到三倍，其中最宝贵的合成纤维将增加十一到十三倍，而塑料和合成树脂的生产将增加五点七倍。
    为什么把发展合成材料放在发展化学工业的主要地位呢？这是因为现在几乎没有一个工业、交通运输和农业部门的发展能缺少合成材料。人们穿的、用的、住的、吃的都与合成材料的生产息息相关。除此之外，合成材料制品又便宜又美观。举例来说吧，用一立方公尺木材就可以制成一百六十公斤人造丝，可以用来织成一千五百公尺绸缎。如果要用天然纺织纤维织成同样数量的绸缎，那末就需要一百万个蚕茧，或者半公顷土地生产的棉花。
    据统计表明，苏联从1913年到1957年四十四年中所增产的绸缎布匹，每人平均为二十公尺，但七年计划规定，到1965年时，按人口平均计算，每人应得的绸缎布匹将为五十六公尺，即比1958年又增加十七公尺。在七年之内绸缎布匹的增产能有如此快的速度，主要是因为合成纤维的迅速增加。例如，1965年将生产十四亿八千五百万公尺绸缎，而其中十二亿三千七百万公尺来自人造丝和合成纤维。这期间合成纤维的针织品也将增加八倍。1965年的人造羔皮产量将由1957年的三十万公尺增为五百万公尺，相当于三十四万头真兽皮。其他的人造皮革也将大大发展。
    塑料在发展国民经济中所起的作用也日益提高。苏联的塑料工业建立于三十年代，今天苏联已生产出了二千多种塑料制品，而全部塑料产量的一半以上是用于机器制造业的。仅仅图—104式喷气客机就采用了十二万个塑料和有机玻璃制造的零件。
    塑料用途的日益扩大，不仅由于它本身具有许多一般天然材料和金属所没有的特性，同时，它的生产成本较低，具有非常巨大的经济价值。据计算，1959年到1965年，仅汽车工业采用的十万吨塑料，就能为国家节省五千吨有色金属，二十万吨钢铁，即节约将近十亿卢布。
      农业增产的钥匙
    近年来，苏联社会主义农业的发展，处在一个新的高涨时期。去年12月召开的苏共中央全会，确定了今后进一步发展农业生产的新任务。目前，苏联农业增产非常迫切的任务是提高一切农作物的单位面积产量。而在实现这项任务时，肥料起着相当重要的作用。
    苏联的矿质肥料生产建立于第一个五年计划时期。记者不久以前访问了第一个五年计划期间所建成的三个大化学肥料厂之一的沃斯克列辛斯克肥料工厂。
    厂长多克托罗夫在谈到化学肥料对农业增产的关系时说，化学肥料的大量增产，这不仅能增产大批谷物和其他农作物，而且可以进一步减轻农业劳动，减低生产成本，节约开支。
    根据统计表明，苏联在1949年前，平均每公顷棉田所施矿质肥料只有五公担，当时每公顷只收获十五到十六公担籽棉，1950年后，由于大量发展矿质肥料生产，每年棉田施肥量有了显著增加。目前，平均每公顷棉田施矿质肥已达九点五公担，结果，使每公顷的籽棉收获量达到二十至二十二公担。
    多克托罗夫厂长还给我们具体介绍了各种化肥和农产品增产的关系，他说，使用一吨氮肥，就可以使土豆增产一百二十吨，甜菜产量增加一百二十到一百六十吨，小麦、燕麦增产十五到二十吨，籽棉增产十到十二吨。而如果使用一吨五氧化二磷作肥料，则可使甜菜增产五十到五十五吨，土豆增产四十到五十吨，小麦、燕麦增产二十吨。矿质肥料还能使农作物产品质量提高，甜菜和葡萄的含糖量、土豆中的淀粉，谷物中的蛋白质，都可以增加。
    谷物生产中广泛使用矿质肥料，不仅提高产量，而且能使劳动力减少40％，产品成本减低20％左右。
    因此，在大力发展化学工业方面，生产矿质肥料和各种农药的工业受到了很大重视。新的化学肥料工厂将成批兴建起来。七年计划规定，矿质肥料生产要增加两倍，即到1965年每年要生产三千一百万吨。
      新工厂星罗棋布
    为了完成七年计划中所规定的化学工业增产任务，除了现有的化学工业企业将进一步提高生产外，还将在全苏各地新建一百四十个现代化学工业企业。一百三十个旧的化学工厂将全部得到改建。为此，国家用于发展化学工业的基本投资达一千亿到一千零五十亿卢布。计划规定整个发展化学工业拨款的一半左右，将用于建设生产塑料、人造纤维和合成纤维、合成橡胶、酒精的企业。
    苏联拥有足够的资源，保证完成最近七年内在发展化学工业方面所提出的巨大的新任务。苏联拥有的化学工业生产所必需的原料，如石油、煤、天然气、木材等的储藏量，居世界首要地位。鞑靼自治共和国、巴什基里亚自治共和国、伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚和阿塞拜疆等地，最近几年内发现了许多新的石油、天然气蕴藏丰富的矿区。这为广泛发展化学工业提供了可靠的雄厚的物质基础。
    苏联大规模兴建的化学企业，都在靠近原料基地的地方。在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克将兴建生产合成橡胶的新企业。七年内该地合成纤维工厂将大批生产卡普隆、尼特隆、拉夫生等等新产品。伏尔加河沿岸的斯大林格勒、古比雪夫和萨拉托夫等州，已经开始兴建一系列的生产塑料、合成纤维、合成橡胶和聚合物原料的工厂。新古比雪夫市内的合成酒精厂的第一期工程已经投入生产。这个工厂利用当地石油炼制厂副产品加工制造出几十万公升的酒精。在靠近古比雪夫水电站的斯塔夫罗波里市附近，一座现代化的生产合成橡胶的大型工厂建设工程已全面兴工。无数的化学工业企业已开始在巴什基里自治共和国、鞑靼自治共和国、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆境内建立。科米自治共和国境内将兴建一座最大的纸浆联合工厂，大量生产纸浆、原纸板、胶合板、木材纤维板、饲料酵母等等。同时，为供应全苏各地兴建与改建化学工厂所需要的大量现代技术设备，正在兴建好几座化学机械制造厂。
    苏联化学工业的巨大发展计划的完成，无疑对促进苏联的国民经济的发展，对满足人民衣食住行等方面的需要，对苏联在纺织品、衣服、鞋类等消费品按人口平均赶上美国的水平方面，都将起巨大的作用。（附图片）
