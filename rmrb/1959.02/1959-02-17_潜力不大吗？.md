Is the Potential Not Great?
    Gong Tongwen

    "The potential is not great, there is not much profit, and there is not much to be done in increasing production and practicing economy." Does this argument conform to the facts? Let the facts answer!

    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, according to preliminary estimates, can save 15,000 to 20,000 tons of metal materials in 1959 by adopting measures to save and use substitutes; the Wuhan Machine Tool Plant, by simply adopting the measure of "cutting the appendix" (simplifying unnecessary parts), can save the raw materials and materials for 220 units of the same product from 1,300 universal tool grinding machines; the Fourth Construction Company of the Wuhan Construction Engineering Bureau can reduce costs by 30% by using silicate prefabricated blocks instead of concrete components; the Provincial Highway Transportation Department can save more than 30% of gasoline as long as it restores and adheres to effective measures such as air fuel savers, safe gliding, and anti-knock fuel savers. There are countless examples of this kind. Facts prove that whether it is a production unit, a construction unit, or a transportation department, there is great potential, a lot of profit, and much can be done in increasing production and practicing economy.

    Why do some comrades feel that "the potential is not great"? This is a problem of ideological method. These comrades only look at problems one-sidedly and statically, rather than comprehensively from a developmental point of view. They believe that after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the potential has been fully exploited. They did not see that it was precisely because of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 that it created a new material and ideological foundation, and the potential became even greater. First, many enterprises have increased their equipment capacity, increased the quantity and variety of products, and the production process has become more complete. In a word, the family property is larger. The larger the family property, the greater the potential and the more methods, which is not difficult to understand. Second, many enterprises have increased their production workers and technical strength, the technical and professional level of production personnel and management personnel has improved, and many problems that could not be solved in the past can be solved on a new basis by working hard and skillfully. Third, the communist consciousness of cadres and the masses has been improved, and their work experience is relatively rich. Especially after opposing conservatism, breaking superstitions, and liberating the mind, as long as we resolutely mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and combine centralized leadership with mass movements, and combine soaring energy with scientific analysis, we can overcome all kinds of difficulties and create amazing miracles. Things that cannot be done by a few people quietly for ten thousand years can be done quickly in the vigorous movement of the broad masses. Fourth, in the process of the Great Leap Forward, it is always inevitable to break the old balance and create a new imbalance, and it is always necessary to overcome the old weak links and create new weak links, constantly overcoming, constantly appearing, overcoming—appearing, then overcoming—then appearing. This is an objective law. According to this law to observe and deal with key production problems, the potential cannot be exhausted. The more the potential is exploited, the more profit will come out, and the article on increasing production and practicing economy is endless.

    潜力不大吗？
    龚同文
    “潜力不大，油水不多，增产节约没有多大文章可做。”——这种论调符合事实吗？还是让事实来回答吧！
    武汉重型机床厂，初步估计，采取节约和使用代用品的措施，1959年可以节省金属料一万五千吨到二万吨；武汉机床厂，仅仅采取“割盲肠”（把不必要部件加以精简）这一项措施，即可从一千三百台万能工具磨床中省出同样产品二百二十台的原料和材料来；武汉建筑工程局第四建筑公司，采用矽酸盐预制块代替混凝土构件，可降低成本30％；省公路运输部门，只要把空气节油器、安全滑行、抗爆节油器等项有效措施恢复起来坚持下去，即可节省汽油30％以上。诸如此类的事例，举不胜举。事实证明，无论生产单位、基建单位或交通运输部门，都是潜力很大，油水不少，增产节约大有文章可做。
    为什么有些同志觉得“潜力不大”呢？这是思想方法问题。这些同志只是片面地静止看问题，而不是全面地从发展的观点看问题。他们认为经过1958年大跃进，已经把潜力挖光了。他们没有看到，正是由于1958年的大跃进，创造了新的物质基础和思想基础，潜力也就更加大了。第一，许多企业的设备能力增加了，产品数量和品种增加了，生产过程也更加完备了。一句话，是家当更大了。家当越大，潜力越大，办法越多，这是不难理解的。第二，许多企业的生产工人和技术力量增加了，生产人员和管理人员的技术水平和业务水平提高了，许多过去不能解决的问题，在新的基础上实行苦干巧干，就能够解决了。第三，干部和群众的共产主义觉悟提高了，工作经验比较丰富了，特别经过反对保守，破除迷信，解放思想，只要坚决地发动群众，依靠群众，把集中领导和群众运动结合起来，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，我们就可以冲破种种困难，创造惊人的奇迹。由少数人冷冷清清去办，一万年都办不到的事，在广大群众的轰轰烈烈的运动中，很快就可以办到。第四，在大跃进的过程中，总是不可免的要打破旧的平衡，出现新的不平衡，总是要克服旧的薄弱环节，又出现新的薄弱环节，不断地克服，不断地出现，克服——出现，再克服——再出现。这是一条客观规律，按照这条规律来观察和处理生产关键问题，潜力是挖不完的。潜力是越挖越大，油水是越出越多，增产节约的文章是无穷无尽的。
