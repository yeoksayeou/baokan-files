    The Masses Wisely Recognize Bandits
    Police and People Cooperatively Capture Criminals

    One afternoon, Comrade Li Fenxiang, a policeman from the Dongcheng Jiao police station in Handan City, Hebei Province, was on duty at the station when Li Tongshan, the director of public security for the East Gate area, suddenly came to report:
    "Two people buying scrap are staying at my shop. Yesterday, one person sold them twenty-five catties of waterwheel chains; today, that person brought more than thirty catties, all of which are new. Because several waterwheel chains were stolen a few days ago, I suspect him."
    After hearing this, Li Fenxiang immediately went with the director of public security to investigate. After seeing the man, they asked him in the name of the iron industry cooperative: "Do you have any more chains? I want to buy some." He said, "No, I don't." The scrap buyer, Old Wei, then said, "The chain you sold me yesterday wasn't enough, let's go to the shop and weigh it." Just as they reached the entrance of the shop, the criminal may have realized what was happening. He took out a pistol (a single-shot homemade gun) from his waist and aimed it at Old Wei, saying, "Stop! Don't move!" Old Wei was terrified. Seeing the tense situation, Li Fenxiang rushed forward to grab his gun. He failed to grab it, and the man broke free and ran away.

    Seeing the man escape, Li Fenxiang immediately chased after him, shouting as he ran. At this time, the militiaman Tie Fulin heard the shouting and came running with his gun. Su Yuzhen, who was pulling a flatbed cart, also picked up an iron hoe to intercept him. Seeing that he couldn't escape, the criminal threatened them with his gun. At this moment, Comrade Fenxiang was stunned, but quickly realized that as a people's policeman, he should eliminate harm for the people, and it would be glorious to die fighting the enemy. He took a few quick steps, and before the criminal could fire, he kicked him forcefully, causing him to stumble and grabbed his gun. After a struggle, he finally seized the gun. At this time, Su Yuzhen and the crowd behind him rushed up and captured the criminal.

    After interrogation, the criminal was named Lu Jinde, a habitual thief left over from the old society who had committed many evils. He was captured as soon as he made a move.

    群众机智识盗匪
    警民合作擒罪犯
    一天下午，河北省邯郸市东城角派出所民警李奉香同志正在所内值班，忽然东门外治保主任李同善来报告说：
    “我店里住着两个买破烂的。昨天一个人拿着二十五斤的水车链子，卖给了他们；今天那个人又背来三十多斤，都是新的，因前几天好几挂水车链子被盗，我很怀疑他。”
    李奉香听说后，就马上随治保主任前往调查。见了那人后，他们以铁业社名义问他：“你还有链子没有，我买点。”他说：“没有了。”买破烂的老魏接着说：“你昨天卖给我的那挂链子不够数，咱到店里称称去吧。”刚走到店门口，可能是被罪犯发觉了，他从腰里掏出手枪（单打土枪）对准老魏说：“站住！不要动！”当时把老魏吓住了。李奉香一看情势紧张，猛上前抓他的枪。未抓住，那人却脱身逃跑了。
    李奉香一看那人逃脱，就立即去追，随追随喊。这时民兵铁福林听见喊声也拿着枪赶来，拉排子车的苏玉振也拿起铁铣截住。罪犯看势不好逃脱，就拿枪威胁。这时，奉香同志猛然一怔，但很快又想到：身为人民警察应为民除害，对敌斗争死了也是光荣的。他紧跑了几步，未等罪犯开枪即用力踢了他一脚，一歪身子就抓住了他的枪。经过争夺，终于将枪夺了过来。这时苏玉振和后跟的群众一拥而上，将罪犯拿住了。
    经过审问，这个罪犯叫卢进德，是个旧社会遗留下来的惯盗，作恶多端。最近他刚一蠢动，便被捉住了。
