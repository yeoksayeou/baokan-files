    Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition in Paris
    Chen Ding
    Following the successful performances of Peking Opera in various parts of France last year, the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition is now being held in Paris. This is the first time that Chinese paintings have been exhibited in France.

    This Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition is sponsored by the France-China Friendship Association. The Chinese Artists Association and the "French House of Thought" provided great assistance. The Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition includes 103 works by eighteen great masters from the rich and prominent century between 1850 and 1950, plus folk New Year pictures from the three regions of North, Central, and South China. Of course, these paintings are only a part of the entire rich and colorful collection of Chinese modern paintings, but because these works inherit the excellent traditions of ancient Chinese paintings and develop them, especially the works of masters such as Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo, Qi Baishi, Huang Binhong, and Xu Beihong, each with its own special style and creativity, they collectively display the face of Chinese modern painting.

    These works were previously exhibited in Italy and were warmly welcomed by the local people. This exhibition in France can be said to be the first large-scale and systematic exhibition of Chinese paintings in Paris in history. Therefore, when the news of the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition in Paris was announced in the newspapers, French art lovers eagerly awaited the opening of the exhibition with a feeling of "seeing it first."

    A preview was held at noon on January 23 to entertain people from the French press and art circles. More than 300 people came to visit the preview, including not only reporters from various news agencies and newspapers throughout France, art editors from newspapers and magazines, but also reporters from major international news agencies and newspapers stationed in Paris. The opening ceremony of the art exhibition was held at 8 p.m. that day. The venue was solemn and simple, full of a friendly atmosphere. Although it had been drizzling since evening, and there were few pedestrians on the street, almost all of the more than 2,000 people from all walks of life who received invitations from the France-China Friendship Association came, and some art lovers even braved the rain from more than ten miles outside Paris.

    The French people have a very common love of art. Paris has an average of 3,000 art exhibitions every year, so there are several opening ceremonies held every day. On the same evening, there was also an opening ceremony for an art exhibition of a French modern painter, Utrillo, nearby, but this did not reduce the number of people attending the opening ceremony of the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition. Every exhibition hall was crowded with people. Even after midnight, people continued to come to visit.

    Among the people from all walks of life who attended the opening ceremony were French painters, art workers, literary and art critics, Chinese friends, and people from political, economic, and cultural circles. Many diplomatic envoys and cultural counselors stationed in Paris, especially envoys and cultural counselors from various socialist countries and Latin American countries, came to visit. Afterwards, the person in charge of the "French House of Thought" said that this was the grandest art exhibition ever held by the "House of Thought." Apart from the Picasso exhibition, few art exhibition opening ceremonies have had so many people attending.

    The President of the France-China Friendship Association, Professor de Laise of the University of Paris, rushed to the venue in his busy schedule, and it was already past 10 p.m. Professor de Laise, surrounded by the crowd, stood in the middle of a large hall and announced the official opening of the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition, and thanked the Chinese Artists Association for its great assistance.

    In his speech, De Laise said that this art exhibition, like the Peking Opera troupe's performance in France last year, and many other Chinese delegations visiting France and French delegations visiting China, has made extremely beneficial contributions to promoting exchanges between the people of France and China. In recent years, cultural and economic exchanges between France and China have helped to enhance mutual understanding among the people and strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

    Guan Shanyue, a famous Chinese painter sent by the Chinese Artists Association to assist in the exhibition, in his reply, in addition to thanking the France-China Friendship Association for hosting this art exhibition and the great assistance of the "French House of Thought," also expressed his gratitude to the French people for their support and to all the people from the art circles who attended the opening ceremony and cared about the new China and loved Chinese culture and art. He agreed with Professor De Laise's view that this art exhibition would further enhance the mutual understanding between the people of China and France and strengthen the friendship between the two countries. He also pointed out that Chinese painting of this period inherited the excellent traditions of ancient painting, was full of creativity, and infiltrated many new elements, paving the way for the development of Chinese painting today.

    While people from all walks of life were visiting the paintings, painter Guan Shanyue explained the various questions they raised to them.

    During the visit, many viewers praised the greatness and depth of Chinese art. They constantly talked about the strong desire of the Chinese people to love life and cherish peace as expressed in Chinese paintings. In the past decade, Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong have been familiar names to the French people. Their paintings are deeply loved and cherished by the people. Not long ago, when the French National Peace Committee held a New Year's charity sale, Chinese paintings sold the best, especially Qi Baishi's paintings, which won the most praise.

    After visiting, a French painting theory critic said to Guan Shanyue: "The French painting circle is launching a fierce struggle on the ideological front. Realism? Or idealistic abstract or impressionistic schools? Thank you for coming to Paris to hold an art exhibition, which has strengthened our courage and confidence in victory when fighting against incorrect ideas."

    After visiting, a painter compared Western paintings with Chinese paintings and said: "Western art has focused on the depiction of the human body since the Renaissance, but the depiction of the human body has gradually been used by some artists with petty bourgeois psychology or hedonism, over-emphasizing the pursuit of carnal desires and showing a decadent tendency. Chinese artists, however, pursue beautiful themes in nature and daily life, which is a healthy expression of national art."

    Many Parisian artists expressed their infinite admiration for the prosperity and development of art under the socialist system. At a forum between painter Guan Shanyue and French painters, a young painter, after listening carefully to the Chinese painter's report on the situation of Chinese painting and art circles, said with great emotion: "The painting of capitalist countries has reached its end. Young painters with promising futures are not encouraged and are ridiculed everywhere. Many old painters do not receive government relief. In the Montparnasse and Montmartre districts of Paris, there are some poor and down-and-out painters living a life of begging."

    Another painter quickly interjected: "Everything in capitalist countries is commodified, and art has no real freedom. Here, there are only monopoly merchants, brokers, and agents who serve the big bourgeoisie... They collude with each other to cruelly exploit and squeeze painters. The evaluation of painters' creations depends on the personal interests and hobbies of capitalists. They can speculate in market transactions and reap huge profits from them. Today, upright painters have no social status, and their works will never be appreciated by people."

    They expressed their envy for the happy life of painters in the new China and asked Guan Shanyue to bring the French painters' salute and friendship back to Chinese painters.

    In recent days, French newspapers and magazines have also continuously published reviews about the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition.

    "L'Humanité" reporter Darr said: "This is an extremely important art exhibition, which carefully selects a part of representative works of China in the past century. Not only Oriental scholars care about this art exhibition, but also French people who care about the great country undergoing unprecedented dramatic changes are paying attention to it."

    "Libération" reporter Guy Dorneaud said: "All those who truly love culture and art should visit the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition. Chinese painting is the glory of mankind." He also said that today, the new China is carrying out a great economic reform with all its strength, but it has not neglected the cultural mission it bears, and constantly gives painting keen attention and great care.

    He also pointed out that this exhibition is some representative works of painters in the past 100 years, and this period is precisely the unfortunate days when China suffered from the invasion of Western imperialism and the rule of feudal dynasties and warlords. However, these painters resolutely opposed the "imitating the ancients" formalism serving the court under feudal rule. At the same time, he also mentioned that today, new Chinese painting has new themes and is further promoting realism and romanticism, approaching people's lives, and serving the revolution.

    Paris "Le Journal" said: "This Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition, which caused a sensation in Paris, is another Chinese art revival in the past century on the basis of the excellent traditions of Chinese painting in the past.

    "Combat" reporter wrote: "This Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition shows that in the past hundred years, Chinese painters have inherited the excellent traditions of the past and jumped out of the barriers of 'imitating the ancients' of ordinary painters in the previous two centuries.

    In a review, the painting review reporter of "Le Figaro" made a comparison between the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition at the "French House of Thought" and the American Modern Painting Exhibition at the Paris Museum of Modern Art at the same time, and had to admit that Chinese art embodies real life and is full of poetry; while American paintings are "unintelligible and show nothing."

    The small number of folk woodcut New Year pictures exhibited in the exhibition (because the venue was small and could not be fully exhibited) also attracted the attention of the French people and were given extremely high evaluations. Through these folk woodcut pictures, people can see the Chinese people's ardent desire to pursue happiness and a peaceful life. The audience praised the richness and colorfulness of this folk art. The "Combat" reporter said that these works are simple, simple, but full of vitality.

    The comments book in front of the art exhibition has been filled with praise and signatures from people from all walks of life in France this week. They unanimously gave extremely high evaluations to the paintings exhibited this time, believing that this Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition has enabled the French people to further understand the excellent cultural traditions of the Chinese people, and better explained how the Chinese government, under the leadership of the Communist Party, is committed to carrying forward the excellent ancient artistic traditions, and further developing today's Chinese people on a new foundation. The combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in socialist construction. Through this art exhibition, the mutual understanding between the people of France and China has been further enhanced, the friendship between the two countries has been strengthened, and world peace has been consolidated.

    中国现代画展在巴黎
    陈鼎
    继去年京剧在法国各地成功演出之后，中国现代画展又在巴黎举行展出。中国绘画在法国举行展览会这还是第一次。
    这次中国现代画展是由法中友好协会主办的。我国美术家协会和“法国思想家之家”给予了很大帮助。中国现代画展展出的国画包括1850年至1950年这一百年间丰富突出的十八个大画师的一百零三幅作品，外加华北、华中、华南三个区域的民间年画。当然这些绘画还仅仅是中国现代全部丰富多彩的绘画的一部分，但由于这些作品继承了我国古代画的优良传统，并加以发展，特别如任伯年、吴昌硕、齐白石、黄宾虹、徐悲鸿等几位大师的作品各具特殊风格和创造性，这也就集中显示了中国现代绘画的面貌。
    不久前这些作品曾在意大利展出，受到当地人民热烈的欢迎。这次在法国展出，可以说是有史以来中国画在巴黎大规模的首次有系统的展出。因此当中国现代画在巴黎展出的消息在报纸上公布之后，法国爱好艺术人士都以“先睹为快”的心情企待画展开幕。
    1月23日中午举行预展，招待法国新闻界和艺术界人士，前来参观预展的有三百余人，其中不仅有全法国各通讯社、报纸的记者，各报及杂志艺术栏编辑，而且还有世界各国驻巴黎重要通讯社和报纸的记者参加。当日晚间八时画展举行开幕式。会场上庄严而又朴素，充满友好气氛。虽然那天自傍晚起就是细雨绵绵，街头行人稀少，但是接到法中友好协会请贴的各界人士二千余人几乎全部都来了，有些艺术爱好者还从巴黎近郊十余里之外冒雨赶来。
    法国人民爱好艺术的风气极为普遍，巴黎每年平均有三千次画展，所以平均每天都有几个画展举行开幕式，同日晚间附近还有一个法国近代画家于特里奥的画展开幕，但并不因此减少参加中国现代画展开幕式的人数，每间展览厅都挤满了人。直到午夜之后，来参观的人还是陆续不断。
    参加开幕式的各界人士中，有法国画家、艺术工作者、文艺评论家，中国友人以及政治、经济、文化界人士。许多驻巴黎外交使节，文化参赞，特别是各社会主义国家，拉丁美洲各国使节和文化参赞来参观的更多。事后据“法国思想家之家”负责人说，这是“思想家之家”举办画展最盛大的一次。除了毕加索画展之外，画展的开幕式很少会有这许多人士参加。
    法中友协会长、巴黎大学教授德莱希在百忙中赶到会场，这时已是晚上十点多了。德莱希教授在群众包围之下站在中间的一间大厅向大家宣布中国现代画展正式开幕，并且感谢中国美术家协会的大力协助。
    德莱希在讲话中说，这次画展犹如去年京剧团在法国演出，以及其他许多中国代表团来法国访问和法国各界代表团去中国访问一样，都是对促进法中两国人民之间的来往作了极有益的贡献。近年来，法中两国的文化经济交流，有助于增进人民的相互了解，加强两国人民的友谊。
    中国美术家协会派来襄助展出的中国著名画家关山月在答词中，除感谢法中友协主持这次画展，“法国思想家之家”的大力协助之外，也对法国人民的支持及所有参加画展开幕式的关心新中国、爱好中国文化艺术界人士表示谢意。他同意德莱希教授所说通过这次画展更能增进中法两国人民的相互了解及加强两国人民的友谊。他也指出中国这一时期的绘画承继了古代绘画的优良传统，富于创造性，渗入许多新因素，为现在中国画的发展开拓了道路。
    在各界人士参观绘画的时候，画家关山月向他们解释了他们所提出的各种问题。
    在参观中，许多观众同声赞赏中国艺术的伟大和深刻。他们不断谈论着中国绘画表现出来的中国人民爱好生活、热爱和平的强烈愿望。近十年来齐白石、徐悲鸿都是法国人民所熟悉的名字。他们的画深为人民所喜爱和珍惜。不久前法国全国和平委员会举行新年义卖时，中国画的销路最好，其中尤以齐白石的画博得好评最多。
    一位法国绘画理论批评家参观后对关山月说：“法国绘画界正展开一场剧烈的思想战线上的斗争。现实主义呢？还是唯心的抽象派或印象派呢？感谢你们到巴黎来举行画展，使我们在与不正确的思想斗争时加强了勇气和必胜的信心。”
    有位画家在参观后对西洋绘画和中国绘画进行比较后说：“西洋艺术自文艺复兴时代起便注重人体的描画了，但这人体的描画发展到目前的境地已逐渐为一部分带着市侩心理或唯欲主义的艺术家们所利用，过度偏向肉欲的追寻而表现着颓废的倾向。中国艺术家们却在大自然及日常生活中追寻美丽的题材，这是健康的民族艺术表现。”
    许多巴黎的艺术家们对于在社会主义制度下艺术的繁荣和发展表示出无限的倾慕。在一次画家关山月和法国画家座谈会上，一位青年画家详细听取了中国画家报告中国绘画和艺术界情况之后，极为感慨地说：“资本主义国家的绘画已到了日暮途穷，具有培养前途的青年画家得不到鼓励，到处受到奚落，许多年老的画家得不到政府救济。在巴黎蒙巴那斯和蒙马特
  （注）两区里，就有一些贫穷潦倒的画家，过着乞讨的生活。”
    另一位画家连忙插嘴说：“资本主义国家一切都商品化，艺术没有真正的自由。这里只有为大资产阶级服务的垄断商人、掮客、经纪人……他们勾结在一起对画家进行残酷的剥削与榨取，画家创作的评价取决于资本家个人的兴趣和嗜好。他们可以在市场交易进行投机买卖，从中猎取巨利。今天正直的画家是没有社会地位的，他们的作品永远得不到人们的欣赏。”
    他们表示羡慕新中国画家的幸福生活，要求关山月把法国画家的敬礼和友谊带回给中国画家。
    连日法国报章杂志也不断刊载有关中国现代画展的评论。
    “人道报”记者达尔说：“这是一次极为重要的画展，精选了中国近百年来一部分具有代表性的作品，不仅东方学者关心这次画展，而且也为关心正在进行史无前例的剧烈变动的伟大国家的法国人士所注意。”
    “解放报”记者纪·铎尔南说：“所有真正爱好文化艺术的人都应去参观中国现代画展。中国绘画是人类的光荣。”他又说，今天新中国以全力进行伟大的经济改革，但并未忽视它所负担的文化使命，而且不断给予绘画殷切注意和极大的关怀。”
    他同时指出这一次展出的是近一百年来的画家的一些代表作品，而这一个时期正是中国遭受到西方帝国主义的侵略，和封建皇朝和军阀的统治的不幸的日子。但这些画家坚决反对封建统治下为宫廷服务的“仿古”形式主义。同时他也提到今天新中国绘画更有了新的题材，正在进一步发扬现实主义和浪漫主义，接近人民生活，为革命服务。
    巴黎“新闻报”说：“这一次轰动巴黎的中国现代画展，是近一世纪来中国绘画在过去优良传统基础上的又一次中国艺术复兴。
      “战斗报”记者写道：“此次中国现代画展，可以看到最近百年来中国画家继承过去优良传统并跳出了前两个世纪一般画家“模古”的藩篱。
      “费加罗报”的绘画评论记者在一次评论中，对于中国现代画展在“法国思想家之家”和美国现代画展同时在巴黎现代艺术博物馆展出做了一番对比之后，也不得不承认中国艺术体现了现实生活，又充满诗意；而美国画却“令人无法理解，看不出什么意思。”
    对于展览会中展出的少量民间木版年画
  （因会场狭小不能全部展出），也获得法国人士的注意，并给予极好的评价。通过这些民间木版图画，人们可以看到中国人民追求幸福与和平生活的热烈愿望。观众都赞赏这种民间艺术的丰富多彩，“战斗报”记者说，这些作品朴素，简单，但充满生命活力。
    画展门前的意见本一周来已经题满法国各界人士的好评和他们的签名。他们对于这次展出的绘画一致给予极高的评价，认为这次中国现代画展使法国人民更进一步了解中国人民的优秀文化传统，更好的说明中国人民政府在共产党领导下如何致力于发扬古代优秀艺术传统，并在新的基础之上进一步发展今天中国人民在社会主义建设中的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的绘画。通过这次画展再一次增进法中两国人民的互相了解，加强两国人民的友谊，并巩固世界和平。
