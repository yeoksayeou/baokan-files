Beijing workers are utilizing existing factory conditions in various ways to accumulate and produce large quantities of fertilizer.

Waste products and scraps that were once considered useless have now become treasures for agriculture. Workers at the Beijing Food Factory have begun to treasure the pomace and distiller's grains (more than 37 tons daily) left over from the production of juice, wine, and fruit oil, and are concentrating them for use as base fertilizer for spring planting by the Nan苑 People's Commune. When the YanJing Paper Mill manufactures pulp, the exhaust fans blow out two to three tons of grass clippings and cloth fuzz that cannot be used to make paper every day. In the past, these things were used to fill ditches or were hauled out of the factory and thrown away. Now, workers collect them and send them to the Heping People's Commune for use as fertilizer. Workers in the calendering section of the Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory carefully scrape off the leftover scraps from sizing cloth from the calendering machine and send them to their farmer brothers as fertilizer.

Workers in various fertilizer manufacturing factories in Beijing are responding to the Party's call with practical actions of exceeding production targets. In the past, the Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory was often affected by insufficient raw materials. Now, the staff has solved this problem by drying, crushing, and sieving peat, so that the bacterial fertilizer produced in late January increased by more than 5% compared to the total produced in the first and middle ten days of the month. The one hundred and forty-two workers in the phosphate fertilizer workshop of the Beijing Chemical Experiment Factory increased the daily phosphate fertilizer production from about twenty-four tons to thirty tons. Worker Ma Peijie said: "The more we produce, the more grain our farmer brothers will harvest." (Attached picture)

### 北京工人多方积肥造肥

    北京工人多方积肥造肥
    首都工人正多方利用工厂现有条件，大量积肥造肥。
    过去被认为一无可取的废品废料，今天已成为农业中的宝物。北京市食品厂的工人，已经开始把生产果汁、果酒和果油所剩的皮渣和酒糟（每天有三十七吨多）珍惜地集中起来，作为南苑人民公社春种作物的底肥。燕京造纸厂在制造纸浆的时候，每天都由排风机吹出二、三吨不能造纸的草末和布毛。过去，这些东西都被填了沟或拉出厂外扔掉。现在工人们收集起来送给和平人民公社作肥料。北京市染织一厂轧光工段的工人们，把浆布剩下的下脚料，从轧光机上仔细地刮下来送给农民兄弟作肥料。
    北京市各个制造肥料工厂的工人，用超额完成生产任务的实际行动响应党的号召。北京市细菌肥料厂，过去由于原料不足，常常影响生产，现在职工们把草炭晒干、粉碎、过筛，解决了这个问题，使1月下旬生产的细菌肥比上、中旬生产的总和还增加5％以上。北京化工实验厂磷肥车间的一百四十二名工人，把每天的磷肥生产量由二十四吨左右提高到三十吨。工人马佩杰说：“我们多生产，农民兄弟就多打粮。”（附图片）
