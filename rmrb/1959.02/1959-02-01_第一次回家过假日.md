I had only been back from the countryside for a little over a month when my uncle had sent word four times, asking me to come home and visit. I heard that the commune would also have a holiday for the New Year. Taking this opportunity to go back, I could have a good chat with the villagers.

I had walked the small path from the city to the countryside two or three times in the summer, and I thought I could find my way back even with my eyes closed. After leaving the city, I walked straight ahead with all my might, not in the mood to look at the scenery, nor bothering to talk to anyone, my mind filled with the labor and life of the year I spent working down there. Who knew that as I walked, a wide and flat highway suddenly appeared, and the small path was gone. I was stunned. Could I have taken the wrong road? I looked back carefully, but no. I asked passersby, but they couldn't explain it clearly either.

After walking for a long time, I suddenly saw a large poplar tree. Wasn't this the famous big tree in the village? During the wheat harvest in the summer, we threshed grain next to it; during the drought resistance campaign, we camped beside it, pushing waterwheels day and night. I was very familiar with every branch and twig of it. Only then did I suddenly remember the red highway that Xiao Liu and Lao Ji had drawn on the planning map two months ago when they participated in the commune's land survey. It seemed that the lines on paper had been carved into the earth!

My legs felt like they had wings, and I flew home in one breath. I shouted, "Uncle!" but there was no movement inside. I was really puzzled and hurried into the house to see what was going on. Everything was still the familiar old way, only the kettle on the stove was breathing, "hissing" and spying on me, the "guest." I took off my hat, warmed my hands, filled the stove with a few briquettes, and planned to sit on the kang and wait for my uncle to come back, giving him an unexpected surprise. But I couldn't sit still and went out of the door again.

I went to the canteen to see Uncle Qingchang first, and also to ask where everyone had gone. When Uncle Qingchang saw me, he and several others rushed up, holding my hands, putting their arms around my shoulders, asking all sorts of questions, and being extremely friendly. Suddenly a voice called me loudly, oh, wasn't that my uncle? He was also wearing a white scarf and a white hat, his hands covered with flour, running over with a smile.

How did my uncle become a cook? I remembered my aunt once telling me that one time she stayed at a relative's house in another village for a few days, and when the steamed buns at home ran out, my uncle went to Uncle Qingchang's house to eat ready-made ones for a few days, never having made a meal himself. Before the canteen was established, I ate at my uncle's house. Don't even mention me making a meal myself, even if I offered a hand, he would seriously interfere. He often said, "A good horse doesn't pull a millstone, a good man doesn't stir the pot." He believed that cooking, washing dishes, and scrubbing pots were inherently women's work.

"Uncle, you've become a cook too!"

"Everyone elected me." My uncle smiled, and his eyes became slits.

"How is it?"

"Not bad."

"Didn't you say: A good horse doesn't pull a millstone, a good man doesn't stir the pot?" Everyone laughed when I said this. My uncle also laughed heartily and said, "Not anymore! Now we've all become the live 'Kitchen Gods' for everyone! Whether you eat well or not all depends on us!"

"Three days apart, the crops grow half an inch." Uncle Qingchang praised my uncle.

I followed my uncle back to the kneading board and started kneading the dough together, making the board "creak, creak."

"Did you see the new highway we built?" my uncle asked as he chopped the dough.

"Yes. It's really fast, it was built in just one or two months!"

"Not one or two months, it only took eight days." My uncle told me in detail that after the commune completed the steelmaking task, it transferred more than three thousand people from various villages to form a "highway army." He and Uncle Qingchang were also transferred to the construction site to cook for all the militiamen. Because the food they made was fragrant, hot, and varied, everyone praised them, and in the end, they carried back a large red flag during the award ceremony, and they also received bonuses individually.

"Your uncle received the highest salary and bonus in the whole village last month," Uncle Qingchang told me.

"If it weren't for the establishment of the commune, the road wouldn't have been built so quickly, the land wouldn't have been cultivated so well, and we wouldn't have received wages either!" my uncle said with emotion.

"Where did Auntie go?" I asked my uncle.

"The village is holding an entertainment meeting, didn't you know? There's even a big opera tonight. The captain said: Everyone has been busy all year! It's a bumper harvest, and the People's Commune has been established, so we have to have a good time for the New Year. Adults and children have all gone to see the show, leaving only us few 'Kitchen Gods' to prepare food for everyone." My uncle coughed a few times and then said, "Tonight you must listen to our village's 'Luantan Opera,' the sheng, xiao, pipes, and flutes, they sing well and play well."

Soon, the food was all prepared, and they were just waiting for the entertainment meeting to end and for people to come back to eat. The dining hall was originally a "Dragon King Temple." Now the walls have been painted white and cleaned so that it is truly "bright on all six sides." The large color portrait of Chairman Mao and the five golden characters of "The People's Commune is Good" hanging on the wall reflect each other, surrounded by large and small red and green banners won by the team over the years from the elementary cooperative, the advanced cooperative to today's People's Commune, plus posters and slogans, truly colorful and vibrant, setting off the dining hall with vigor and vitality. In the middle of the room, there is also a large stove, burning so that the whole room is warm. At mealtime, each family has a small dining table, adults and children clustered together happily, like blooming flowers scattered throughout the dining hall. My aunt said to me, "In those days, this hall was gloomy, and it was scary to walk in. Now that it's a dining hall, look how bright and spacious! How lively and bustling!"

After dinner, my uncle wanted me to go see the big opera, and I asked my aunt to go with us. But my aunt said:

"Knowing that you would come home sooner or later, I have already taken the quilt apart and washed it, but I haven't sewn it up yet, so I have to hurry up and sew it for you to cover tonight." Speaking of going home, my uncle gently blamed me:

"If you hadn't come back today, I would have gone to find you tomorrow. Originally, I borrowed the cart yesterday, planning to pick you up today. Everyone said that today we are improving our lives for the New Year, and we are busy. We can't let our own affairs affect everyone. Otherwise, maybe 'Two Immortals Go Separate Ways' and we won't see each other again!"

These few words from my uncle and aunt were like honey smeared on my heart, spreading throughout my body with the blood flow, making me feel sweet, warm, and comfortable all over.

After the star set in the west, the opera ended. On the way home, my uncle repeatedly exclaimed loudly with great excitement, "We are having a more and more enjoyable New Year!"

    第一次回家过假日
    木火
    离开农村回来才一个多月，大伯就托人捎了四次口信，要我回家去看看。新年，听说公社也休假。乘这机会去一次，和乡亲们畅快地聊聊。
    从城里到农村的小路，夏天我走过两三趟，心想闭着眼睛也能摸回去。出了城，就一股劲儿往前走，没有心思看景物，也没顾着和人吭声，眼前浮现出的净是下放一年的劳动和生活情景。谁知走着走着，突然出现了一条宽阔平坦的公路，小路却没有了。这下子，我可楞住了。莫非走错了路？回头仔细看了看，没有。问路人，也都说不清楚。
    走了好大一阵，忽然望见了一棵大白杨树。这不就是村里有名的那棵大树吗？夏天收麦时，我们在她旁边打过场；抗旱运动时，我们在她跟前安营下寨夜以继日地推过水车，它的一枝一梢，我都非常熟悉。这时我才蓦地想起了两个月前小刘和老吉参加公社土地测量，画在规划图上的红色公路来。看来纸上的线条已经刻划在大地上！
    我的腿上像长了翅膀似的，一口气就飞回了家。我喊叫了一声“大伯”，里边却没点动静。我真有些纳闷，急忙跑进屋里看个究竟。一切陈设还是十分熟悉的老样子，只有炕炉上的水壶喘着气，吁吁地窥视着我这位“客人”。我摘下帽子，烤烤手，往炉子里填了几块煤糕，心里盘算坐在炕上等着大伯他们回来，给他们一个意外的惊喜。但是，怎么也坐不住，不由得又出了房门。
    我就到食堂先看看庆昌叔，也好问问人们都上哪去了。庆昌叔一见我，和几个人一起涌上来，拉手搭肩、问长问短，亲热极了。忽然一个声音大声唤我，呀，那不是大伯吗？他也围上白围巾，戴上白帽子，两手粘满了面，笑眯眯地跑来了。
    大伯怎么来当炊事员呢？记得大娘曾经告诉我，有一次她到别村亲戚家住了几天，家里蒸就的饼子没有了，大伯就跑到庆昌叔家吃了几天现成的，自个从没动手做过吃。食堂未成立以前，我在大伯家吃饭，甭说我自个动手做顿饭，就是搭个手，他也要认真地干涉。他常说：“好马不拉磨，好汉不动锅”。他认为做饭弄菜、洗锅刷碗天生就是妇女的事。
    “大伯，你也做了炊事员了！”
    “大伙把我选上的。”大伯一笑，眼睛就变成了一条缝。
    “怎么样？”
    “蛮好。”
    “你不是说：好马不拉磨，好汉不动锅吗？”我这么一说，大伙都笑了。大伯也爽朗地笑着，说：“不啦！我们现在可都成了大伙的活‘灶王爷’了！吃好吃歹全仗着我们哩！”
    “三天不见面，庄稼长寸半。”庆昌叔赞了大伯一句。
    我跟着大伯走回面案，一块动手揉起面，揉得案板“吱”、“吱”地响。
    “你看到咱们新修的公路没有？”大伯剁着卷子问我。
    “是啊。真是快，一两个月就修成了！”
    “哪里一两个月，只用了八天。”大伯详细告诉我：公社完成炼钢任务后，就从各村抽调了三千多人，组成“公路大兵团”。他和庆昌叔也被调到工地为全村民兵去烧饭。因为做的饭又香、又热、花样又多，大伙直称赞，最后评奖时扛回来一面大红旗，个人还领到了奖金。
    “你大伯上月领的工资和奖金，全村数着头一份。”庆昌叔告诉我。
    “不是成立公社，路怎么也修不成那么快，地也整不成那么好，我们也领不上工资啊！”大伯感慨地说。
    “大娘上哪去啦？”我问大伯。
    “村里开娱乐会，你还不知道？晚上还要唱大戏。队长说：大伙儿忙了一年啦！大丰收，又加上人民公社成立，过年得好好乐和乐和。大人孩子都去看玩意了，只剩下我们这几个‘灶王爷’给大伙准备饭。”大伯咳嗽了几声接着又说：“今晚你可要听听咱村的‘乱弹戏’，笙萧管笛，唱的又好，吹的又好。”
    不久，饭菜都打点好了，就等着娱乐会散了人们回来开饭。饭厅原先是座“龙王庙”。如今墙上已经刷得洁白，打扫得真是“六面光”。墙上挂着的毛主席大幅彩色肖像和“人民公社好”五个大金字交相辉映，周围还有队里从初级社、高级社到今天人民公社历年来赢得的大大小小红绿锦旗，加上招贴画、标语，真个万紫千红、五彩缤纷，衬得饭厅生气勃勃。屋子当中还盘着一个大炉子，烧得满屋暖洋洋。吃饭时，一家一个小饭桌，大人孩子乐融融的一簇一团，像朵朵锦花散满全饭厅。大娘对我说：“当年这座殿是阴森森的，走进来怪怕人。而今做了饭厅，你看多么豁朗亮堂！多么红火热闹！”
    饭后，大伯要我去看大戏，我请大娘也一块去。大娘却说：
    “知道你迟早会要回家来，我已把被子拆洗，就是还没缝好，晚上得给你赶着缝起盖。”提起回家，大伯轻轻地责备我：
    “你要是今天还不回来呀，明天我就要找你去。本来昨天我就把车子借好，预备今天接你去。大伙说今天过年改善生活，活忙。咱可不能因为自个事，影响大伙。要不，说不定‘二仙穿道’走到两岔，又见不到面！”
    大伯和大娘这几句话，真好像甘蜜涂在我心上，随着血流传遍全身，使我浑身甜滋滋的、暖和和的。
    明星偏西后，戏才散。在回家道儿上，大伯一再兴高彩烈地大声嚷着说：“咱们过年真是越过越痛快啦！”
