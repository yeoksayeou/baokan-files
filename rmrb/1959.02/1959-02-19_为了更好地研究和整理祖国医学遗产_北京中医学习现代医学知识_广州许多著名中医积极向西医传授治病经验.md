Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: In order to better explore and organize the great treasure of the motherland's medicine, some TCM practitioners in Beijing medical institutions have begun to study modern medical knowledge in conjunction with their medical, research, and summarization work.

Some of these TCM practitioners have participated in training classes, some closely cooperate with Western medicine doctors in combination with cases to teach and learn from each other or participate in Western medicine case discussions, and some learn some modern medical knowledge in the process of summarizing medical experience. They generally study basic knowledge such as anatomy, physiology, and bacteriology. Some people have initially mastered Western medicine's physical and laboratory diagnostic skills, and when seeing patients, they perform routine tests on blood, sputum, urine, and feces, or liver and kidney function tests. Some TCM practitioners at the Beijing TCM Hospital and the Beijing First TCM Outpatient Department have now begun to use Western medicine's physical and laboratory diagnostic methods for early diagnosis when dealing with some diseases with unclear symptoms. This allows them to not only treat based on accurate diagnoses but also summarize some of TCM's diagnostic and treatment experiences. After learning bacteriology and surgery, doctors in the TCM Hospital's surgical and dermatology departments strictly disinfect the affected areas or perform various clinical operations when treating patients. Most acupuncture TCM practitioners in the Acupuncture Outpatient Department and Beijing Sixth Hospital have studied anatomy and have a further understanding of the distribution of the nervous system, blood circulation, muscles, bones, and other human structures. Traditional acupuncture experience and ancient medical literature have prescribed some acupuncture points as forbidden for needling, moxibustion, or deep insertion. However, in the past, they "only knew the what but not the why." Now that they know that these forbidden acupuncture points are located close to arteries and veins, major organs, or viscera, they can better carry out acupuncture treatment.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 18th: A group of famous TCM practitioners in Guangzhou actively impart their many years of treatment experience to Western medicine doctors, and jointly carry out treatment and research work with Western medicine. Now, many famous TCM doctors in Guangzhou actively participate in the teaching work of TCM spare-time schools and study classes held by various medical institutions in the city. Acupuncture doctors Situ Ling, Hu Jisheng, and He Youliang have recently taken on the teaching of acupuncture courses at the Guangzhou TCM Spare-time University. Feng Deyi, Dean of Studies of Guangzhou College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Luo Yuankai, Director of the Further Education Department, and Deng Tietao, a teacher, respectively lectured on basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine in places such as the Guangzhou Military Region General Hospital. Luo Yuankai, Deng Tietao, and Liang Naijin, Dean of the Guangdong TCM Experimental Hospital, also served as teachers for the TCM teaching and research group of Zhongshan Medical College. They prepare lessons carefully and write lecture notes before lecturing. Situ Ling, Hu Jisheng, He Youliang and others from the acupuncture teaching and research group of the TCM Spare-time University also personally tutor practice, patiently teaching acupuncture techniques and methods of finding acupuncture points. In preparing lessons, some people not only refer to TCM works but also refer to some Western medical books, combining them for analysis during teaching, which students find easy to accept.

Many famous doctors have begun to enthusiastically establish cooperative relationships with hospitals in Guangzhou in their treatment and research practice, conduct joint consultations, carry out research work, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and promote the integration of Chinese and Western medicine. The Guangdong TCM Experimental Hospital and Zhongshan Medical College have established close cooperative relations. Liang Naijin, the dean, and Yang Zhiren, the director of the medical affairs department, regularly go to the affiliated hospitals of Zhongshan Medical College for consultation every week. Zhongshan Medical College also sends professors to the TCM Experimental Hospital for consultation, jointly discussing the condition, formulating treatment plans, systematically observing the efficacy, and collaboratively carrying out special research on chronic diseases such as hypertension, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and peptic ulcers.

    为了更好地研究和整理祖国医学遗产
    北京中医学习现代医学知识
    广州许多著名中医积极向西医传授治病经验
    新华社18日讯　北京市有些医疗机构的中医，结合医疗、研究和总结工作的过程，开始学习现代医学知识，以便发掘和研究整理祖国伟大的医药学宝库。
    这些中医有的参加了训练班，有的结合病例和西医密切合作互教互学或参加西医的病例讨论会，也有的在总结医疗经验过程中学习一些现代医学知识。他们一般都学习了解剖学、生理学、细菌学等基础知识，有些人已经初步掌握了西医的物理、化验的诊断技能，在应诊时对病人作血、痰、尿、屎的常规检验或肝、肾功能的试验。北京市中医医院、北京市第一中医门诊部等单位的有些中医现在在处理一些症状不明的病症时，已开始配合运用西医的物理、化验的诊断方法作早期诊断，这样既能根据确凿的诊断进行治疗，又能总结中医在诊断上和治疗上的一些经验。中医医院外科和皮肤科大夫学习细菌学、外科学以后，对治疗病人的患部，或作临床各种操作时，都要进行严格的消毒。针灸门诊部、北京市第六医院的大部分针灸中医都学习了解剖学，对神经系统的分布、血液循环、筋肉、骨胳等人体构造有了进一步了解。传统的针灸经验和古代医学文献中，对人体有些穴位都作了禁针、禁灸或禁深刺的规定。但是，过去“只知其然而不知其所以然”，现在知道了这些禁针、禁灸、禁深刺的穴位，都是紧挨着动静脉、主要器官或脏器的地方，因此可以更好地进行针灸治疗。
    新华社广州18日电　广州市一批著名中医，积极向西医传授多年的治病经验，协同西医开展治疗和研究工作。现在，广州市许多著名中医师都积极参加了市内各医疗机构举办的中医业余学校和学习班的教学工作。针灸医师司徒铃、胡济生、何友良等三人，最近担任了广州市中医业余大学针灸课的教学。广州中医学院教务长冯德瑜、进修部主任罗元恺、教师邓铁涛等分别在广州部队总医院等处讲授中医基本理论的课程。罗元恺、邓铁涛和广东省中医实验医院院长梁乃津等还担任了中山医学院中医教研组的教学工作。他们在讲课前都认真进行备课，写讲稿。中医业余大学针灸教研组司徒玲、胡济生、何友良等并且自己辅导实习，耐心地传授针灸手法和找穴位的方法。有的人在备课中除了翻阅中医著作之外，还参考一些西医学的书籍，在教学时结合起来进行分析，学员感到容易接受。
    许多著名医师在自己治疗和研究的实践中，已开始热情地和广州市各医院建立协作关系，进行合诊，开展研究工作，互相取长补短，促进中西医合流。广东省中医实验医院和中山医学院建立了密切协作关系，院长梁乃津和医务部主任杨志仁每周定期到中山医学院的附属医院会诊，中山医学院也派教授到中医实验医院会诊，共同讨论病情，拟定治疗方案，系统观察疗效，并且协作开展了对高血压病、肝硬化、肝炎、消化性溃疡等慢性病的专题研究。
