Today, over Wuhan, spring thunder rumbles, joyous rain falls, and winter sweet and red plum blossoms beam with joy as the spring of 1959 arrives.

1958 was a year of great victory, and the situation of the Great Leap Forward has unfolded. Under the leadership of the Party, our workers and peasants are raising high the red flag with overwhelming force, advancing victoriously to realize the Great Leap Forward plan for 1959!

"Feet on the Earth, Hands Holding up the Sky, Moving Mountains and Filling Seas, Overcoming All Difficulties." This is the bold declaration of the workers on the Danjiangkou project site. Our heroic people, with lofty aspirations and courageous strides, are marching towards nature, transforming the rivers and mountains of the motherland at a mythical speed, sweeping away poverty, disease, ignorance, and all plagues from our land, and building the motherland into a prosperous and beautiful great garden. The construction cause of our motherland is advancing at a thousand miles a day. Those with conservative ideas have fallen behind in the ranks of the revolution, and they always complain to others, saying: "Going too fast, going too fast." We advise those comrades with conservative ideas to quickly raise their heads, identify the direction of progress, accelerate their pace, and stop pointing fingers and complaining! Otherwise, the torrent of the Great Leap Forward will throw you onto the beach.

We are born in the era of the Great Leap Forward, and we must hold high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, and sing loudly the song of the Great Leap Forward:

	East wind blows, red flags unfurl,
	Songs resound throughout the land;
	Whips crack on swift horses, covering a thousand miles a day,
	A year of the Great Leap Forward surpasses another.

	Early spring brings laughter to the world,
	The people's enthusiasm pierces the sky;
	Industry and agriculture leap forward together,
	Welcoming the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    早春欢笑到人间
    龚同文
    今天武汉上空，春雷轰鸣，喜雨纷纷，迎春花、红梅花笑逐颜开，1959年的春天来到了。
    1958年是伟大胜利的一年，大跃进的局面已经展开了，在党的领导下，我国的工人、农民正在以排山倒海之势，为实现1959年的跃进计划高举红旗，乘胜前进！
    “脚踏地球手托天，移山填海排万难。”这是丹江工程工地上职工们的豪语。我们英雄的人民，有着雄伟的志向，跨着英勇的步伐，向自然界进军，以神话般的速度改造祖国的河山，要把贫困、疾病、愚昧和一切瘟神从我们的国土上打扫干净，把祖国建设成一座繁荣美丽的大花园。我们祖国的建设事业在一日千里的前进。那些有保守思想的人，他们在革命行列中落伍了，他们总是埋怨旁人说：“走快了，走快了”。奉劝那些有保守思想的同志，赶快抬起头来，看准前进的方向，加快前进的步伐，不要再指手划脚的发牢骚啊！不然跃进的洪流会把你抛上沙滩。
  我们生长在大跃进的时代，我们要高举大跃进的红旗，高唱大跃进的歌：
        东风阵阵红旗展，九州处处歌声传；
        快马加鞭日千里，跃进一年胜一年。
        早春欢笑到人间，人民干劲冲破天；
        工业农业双跃进，迎接国庆十周年。
