Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd: The Soviet "Izvestia" wrote on the 21st that after the American ruling groups and their followers in Lebanon and the United Arab Republic suffered a complete defeat in their movement against the so-called communist danger in the Near East, they have begun to engage in despicable fabrications and slanders against Soviet foreign policy.

"Izvestia" pointed out that to achieve this goal, the American United Press International and Associated Press, as well as newspapers like the British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," spread provocative lies, insisting that a large number of Jewish emigrants were moving from the Soviet Union to Israel, and implying that this was seemingly to increase Israel's military and personnel potential. "Izvestia" emphasized that the provocateurs were not satisfied with these propagandas, they even fabricated out of thin air that Soviet Jews would supposedly participate in the upcoming World Zionist Congress in Stockholm.

"Izvestia" wrote that these lies can only be used to deceive gullible people, because everyone knows clearly that in the past and present no Jews have migrated from the Soviet Union to Israel. As for the upcoming Zionist Congress, it is equally clear that since 1917 Soviet Jews have never participated in such meetings and consider Zionism a reactionary sect. Their attitude towards Zionism has not and cannot have any change.

"Izvestia" continued that the American propaganda machine is doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the Arab peoples, inciting Arabs to quarrel with their loyal friends in socialist countries, friends who have assisted them more than once at the most critical moments of their lives. It is wishful thinking for the slanderers in Washington to expect the Arab peoples to forget these things. The facts show that the Soviet Union's policy of friendship and cooperation towards Arab countries, including the United Arab Republic, has been, is, and will be permanent and unchanging.

    所谓犹太人移民之说纯系捏造
    苏“消息报”斥造谣者挑拨伎俩
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“消息报”21日写道：美国统治集团和他们在黎巴嫩和阿拉伯联合共和国的追随者在反对所谓对中近东的共产主义危险的运动遭到完全失败以后，又开始对苏联的外交政策进行卑劣的捏造和诽谤。
    “消息报”指出，为了达到这个目的，美国的合众国际社和美联社以及像英国的“每日电讯与晨邮报”这样一些报纸，散布了挑拨性的谎言，硬说什么有大批犹太侨民从苏联移居以色列，并且暗示这样作似乎是为了增加以色列的军事潜力和人员的潜力。“消息报”强调指出，挑拨者对于这些宣传还感到不够，他们还凭空捏造说，苏联的犹太人似乎将参加即将在斯德哥尔摩召开的世界犹太复国主义代表大会。
    “消息报”写道，这些谎言只能用来蒙骗轻信的人们，因为大家都清楚地知道，过去和现在都没有任何犹太人从苏联迁往以色列。至于谈到即将举行的犹太复国主义代表大会，同样清楚，自1917年以来苏联犹太人就一直没有参加过这种会议，并认为犹太复国主义是一种反动的流派。他们对犹太复国主义的态度没有、而且不可能有任何的改变。
    “消息报”接着写道，美国的宣传机构千方百计地破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结，唆使阿拉伯人同他们的社会主义国家的忠实朋友争吵，这些朋友在他们生命的最紧要关头曾经不止一次援助过他们。华盛顿的诽谤家指望阿拉伯各国人民忘记这些是枉费心机的。事实说明，苏联所奉行的对阿拉伯国家，其中包括对阿拉伯联合共和国的友好和合作的政策，过去、现在和将来都是永久不变的。
