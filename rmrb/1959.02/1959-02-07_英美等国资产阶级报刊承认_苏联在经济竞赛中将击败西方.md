Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy discussed at the congress have caused a huge shock to Western bourgeois public opinion. Although Western bourgeois newspapers have made various slanders against the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, they have to admit that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan is grand in scale, while the economies of Western countries are stagnating, and the West is losing ground in the economic competition between the two systems.

The British "Reynolds News" commented on the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, saying: "Now only fools would laugh at these plans. Behind these plans are unprecedented achievements. Supporting these plans are institutions of higher learning, which train nearly three times more engineers than American universities; generally speaking, the number of students enrolled in higher education is about four times the total number of students enrolled in Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy."

The newspaper also pointed out that the Soviet Union "has no artificial barriers to reduce the production of goods. They have been able to fully develop their economy," while the West "puts people and machines aside because it is not 'worthwhile' to make people and machines work."

The "New York Times" published a feature article on January 29 entitled: "The Tortoise and the Hare - The Slow Pace of American Economic Development Suggests that the Soviet Union May Win the Race."

The feature wrote: "Khrushchev predicted that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union's economic development will reach an annual growth of about 8.6%. Based on recent achievements, his words may not be far from the truth. Mr. Khrushchev compared this with the United States' annual growth rate of 2%. In fact, he was too polite. Because since the end of the Korean War, the average annual economic growth rate of our country (excluding the factors of price increases) has been less than 1.5%."

The author asked: "Why has (America's) development slowed down?" In answering this question, he said that economists in all aspects of the United States believe that the slow economic development of the United States is due to the "economic recession" that occurred under the capitalist system. He wrote: "All aspects acknowledge that the main reason for the decline in the average growth rate in the past six years is the two recessions that occurred during this stage. During the recession, the economy declined, rather than rose."

The author admitted that the development of the American economy is still "almost stagnant." Some of the "growth" in recent years is mainly due to price increases.

The author believes that if this situation continues, the Soviet Union's goal of catching up with the United States in 1970 will be achievable.

### 英美等国资产阶级报刊承认  苏联在经济竞赛中将击败西方

    英美等国资产阶级报刊承认
    苏联在经济竞赛中将击败西方
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏共第二十一次代表大会和这次大会上讨论的苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，引起了西方资产阶级舆论的巨大震动。尽管西方资产阶级报刊对苏联的七年计划进行各种诬蔑，但是它们不得不承认，苏联七年计划规模宏伟，而西方国家的经济则陷于停滞，在两个制度的经济竞赛中，西方正在节节败退。
    英国“雷诺新闻”在评论苏联的七年计划时说：“现在只有傻子才会嘲笑这些计划。在这些计划的背后是空前巨大的成就。支持这些计划的是高等学院，它们训练的工程师比美国高等学校训练的工程师多将近三倍；一般地说来，高等学校的入学人数大约比英国、法国、西德和意大利的入学人数的总和多四倍。”
    这家报纸还指出，苏联“没有削减货物生产的人为障碍。他们得以充分地发展他们的经济”，而西方却“把人和机器搁置起来，因为使人和机器工作是不‘上算的’”。
    “纽约时报”1月29日刊载了一篇特稿，题目是：“乌龟和兔子——美国经济发展的缓慢速度说明苏联可能在竞赛中获胜。”
    这篇特稿写道：“赫鲁晓夫预言，今后七年，苏联的经济发展将达到每年增长8.6％左右。根据最近的成就来看，他的话可能不致错到那里去。赫鲁晓夫先生说这话时同美国每年2％的增长率作了比较。其实他未免太客气了。因为自从朝鲜战争结束以来，我国每年的经济发展速度（除去物价提高的因素以外）平均不到1.5％。”
    作者问道：“（美国的）发展为什么会慢下来？”他在回答这个问题时说，美国各方面的经济学家都认为，美国经济发展缓慢是由于资本主义制度下出现的“经济衰退”。他写道：“一切方面都承认过去六年平均增长率下降的主要原因是这个阶段出现两次衰退，在衰退期间经济是下降的，而不是上升的。”
    作者承认，美国经济的发展仍然“几乎陷于停滞状态”。这几年中所有的某些“增长”主要是由于价格上涨。
    作者认为，照这种情况继续下去，苏联在1970年赶上美国的目标将能够实现。
