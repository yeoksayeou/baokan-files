　　The Rebirth of an Ancient Castle
　　Lin Hai
　　Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is a beautiful ancient city. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides, standing on the banks of the blue Danube River. On the hills overlooking the river stands an old and huge castle, the famous Devin Castle. This castle was destroyed by fire in 1811 and remained desolate for more than a century. Now, in socialist Czechoslovakia, it has regained its life and stands majestically in the center of the city with unprecedented vitality, adding extra charm to Bratislava.
　　The Czechoslovak people say it looks like an upside-down table. Indeed, the four corners of the castle are towering, like the four legs of a table. It was built two thousand years ago by feudal aristocrats to protect their rule, and it is the crystallization of the wisdom and sweat of the working people. This tall and solid castle resisted the invasion of the Germans during the Great Moravian Empire in the ninth century. It was also the residence and activity place of some famous scholars more than a thousand years ago. Of course, it also served as a palace and became the center of political activities for the feudal dynasty. But after it was destroyed by fire, this once illustrious masterpiece of the working people became a pile of ruins. During the period of capitalist rule, it was not only not maintained and repaired, but also further damaged due to lack of management. People could only sadly mourn the relics left by this castle.
　　In the era of the people's regime, this historically significant ancient castle has been restored according to its original style and has been given more and newer content. It is not only a bright pearl on the head of beautiful Bratislava, but also an important cultural activity center for the Slovak people.
　　The Czechoslovak government and people have spent a lot of manpower and financial resources to maintain, repair, and expand this castle. The restoration work began after liberation, and a specific plan for expansion was formulated in 1955. By the end of last year, the external structure, except for the roof, had been completed. This year, the dead building will begin to awaken, and by 1961, the new building will be fully completed. In order to build a huge modern building with an area of 11,400 square meters from a pile of ruins, the Czech government spent approximately 32 million crowns.
　　Although the cornerstone of this restored castle is still the one laid by the rulers of the Roman Empire two thousand years ago, its appearance has been greatly changed. The new building, when completed, will become a Slovak cultural museum with 574 rooms. It includes a large concert hall, a historical museum, a Roman culture exhibition room, and a large conference hall. There are also libraries, reading rooms, and clubs. In the courtyard of this ancient castle, an open-air theater with a capacity of 2,000 spectators will also be built. In the future, the working people of Czechoslovakia, especially Bratislava, will be able to come here frequently to absorb the long-standing cultural heritage of their motherland, enjoy a rich and colorful cultural life, and appreciate the labor creations of their ancestors.
　　Czechoslovakia is a country with rich historical relics. There are about 2,500 ancient castles in the country. After liberation, the Czech Communist government attaches great importance to these crystallizations of the wisdom of the working people. Currently, 3,000 ancient castles and palaces have been included in the national antiquities preservation plan. Some of them have become national cultural strongholds, and some have served the people as museums, libraries, or galleries. (Attached picture)

    古城堡的新生
    林海
    斯洛伐克的首府布拉迪斯拉发是一座风景幽美的古城。它三面环山，耸立在蓝色的多瑙河畔。在临河的山岗上，有一座古老而巨大的城堡，这就是著名的杰云城堡。这座城堡在1811年因失火被毁，荒芜了一百多年，现在，在社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克，又重新获得了生命，而且以过去无法比拟的活力巍然屹立在城市的中心，给布拉迪斯拉发增添了格外的风采。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民说它像一张翻过来的桌子。真的，城堡的四角高耸，恰似桌子的四条腿。这是二千年前封建贵族们为了保护自己的统治而修建的，它是劳动人民智慧和血汗的结晶。这座高大而坚固的城堡曾在第九世纪大摩拉维亚王朝时抵抗过日尔曼人的侵略，同时它也曾是一千多年前一些有名的学者居住和活动过的地方。当然，它也曾作为王宫而成为封建王朝政治活动的中心。但在它因火灾焚毁后，这座曾经煊赫一时的劳动人民的精心杰作就成了一堆废墟。在资本主义统治期间它不仅没有得到维护和修理，而且因无人管理还遭到了进一步的损坏。人们只能以惋惜的心情凭吊这个城堡所留下的遗迹。
    在人民政权的年代里，这座富有历史意义的古城堡按照原来的式样和风格修复了，而且还得到了更多更新的内容。它不但是秀丽的布拉迪斯拉发头上的一颗明珠，而且成为了斯洛伐克人民重要的文化活动中心。
    为维护、修复和扩建这座城堡，捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民花了很大的人力和财力。修复工作在解放后就开始了，1955年制定了扩建的具体规划。到去年年底，除屋顶外，外部结构已经完工，今年这座死去的建筑将开始苏醒，而到1961年，新建筑就要全部竣工。为了把一堆残垣断堞修建成面积一万一千四百平方公尺的巨大现代化建筑，捷政府支出约三千二百万克朗的费用。
    这座被修复的城堡的基石虽然仍是二千年前罗马帝国统治者们所安下的，但它的面貌却已大大改观。新的建筑物完工后将成为一个拥有五百七十四个房间的斯洛伐克文化博物馆。它包括一个大音乐厅、一个历史博物馆、一个罗马文化展览室和一个大会议厅。此外还有图书馆、阅览室和俱乐部等。在这座古城堡的庭院里，还将建成一座可容纳二千观众的露天剧场。捷克斯洛伐克特别是布拉迪斯拉发的劳动人民，今后便可经常来到这里吸取祖国悠久的文化遗产，享受丰富多彩的文化生活，欣赏他们祖先的劳动创造。
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个有着丰富历史文物的国家，全国约有二千五百个古代城堡，解放后，捷共和政府十分重视这些劳动人民智慧的结晶，目前已有三千个古代城堡和宫殿被列入国家的古物保存计划中。它们当中的一部分已成为国家的文化据点，有的已经作为博物馆、图书馆或画廊而为人民服务。（附图片）
