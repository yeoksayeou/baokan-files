    Cold and Heat
    Xie Juezai
    Comrade Xu Fanting's poem to Chairman Mao:
    A leader among leaders, yet not self-important,
    As still as a virgin, as vigorous as a hero.
    Your qualities, sir, are beyond compare,
    "A feather from a cloud soaring for eternity."

    "As still as a virgin" is cold, "as vigorous as a hero" is heat. Cold and heat are opposites, yet they are unified.

    Military books say: "Begin like a virgin, so the enemy opens his gate; then move like a fleeing rabbit, catching the enemy off guard." Those who practice swordsmanship also say: "Be as still as a virgin, move like a fleeing rabbit." Stillness is the preparation for movement, that is, cold is the preparation for heat. Only by calmly analyzing the situation, studying the methods, and then acting with confidence, can we have a heat that is not without source, that can withstand evil winds, and that is not afraid of being doused with cold water. Conversely, those who have a "hot" spirit of high responsibility and are not afraid of any difficulties can easily transition from hot to cold, seeking the various favorable and unfavorable factors, and determining the way forward to achieve further success.

    "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." Going all out and aiming high are hot. Without soaring enthusiasm and the determination to strive for the top, nothing can be achieved. However, merely having a surge of enthusiasm does not automatically bring greater, faster, better, and more economical results or achieve the top. These require scientific analysis, using our brains to think, repeated experimentation, and objective investigation. Our brains must be both cold and hot, either cold and hot at the same time, or hot for a while followed by a period of cold, so that we can use heat to advance our work and use cold to examine and summarize it.

    Cold and heat are mutually needed and complementary; they are opposing aspects of a unity. Loving only cold and not heat, saying that this is nonsense, is impossible; it's like trying to trip people up and keep them standing still. Although there are not many such people, they still exist. If they are stubbornly resistant, then let them become rigid. Another type of person only loves heat and not cold. Within this type, there are two kinds: one is wholeheartedly loyal and goes straight ahead, wanting to reach the sky but not knowing how to manufacture and use a "rocket." These people are bound to stumble, and perhaps after a fall, their minds will clear, and they will realize the usefulness of cold. But it is always better not to stumble, as stumbling always entails losses. Especially for those in leadership positions, a single stumble often causes greater losses to the work and the people. The other is seeing everyone else hot and bothered, they follow suit, shouting slogans but not taking action. This is fake heat and true cold, and we don't want this kind of heat.

    In our country's construction of socialism, "one day equals twenty years," and all work is progressing in leaps and bounds. Leaping forward requires heat; loving cold and not heat is unacceptable. Take agriculture, for example. Our country has a wealth of experience, but agricultural increases in production have traditionally been gradual, even remaining at the same level for many years. This is because people "obey the old ways" and dare not break conventions, resulting in more cold than heat. Now it is different. The people demand solutions to the urgent problems of food and clothing, and demand the early and over-fulfillment of the four, five, and eight-year programs. Thus, the upsurge of crossing the Yellow River, catching up with the South, achieving thousand-jin provinces, double-thousand-jin counties, and ten-thousand-jin mu has emerged. Thus, the Eight-Point Charter for agriculture – water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management – has emerged. The former comes from heat, and the latter comes from cold. "Cold" is forced into success by heat. "Heat" can force those who like cold to become hot; the situation forces people, and one cannot be unenthusiastic. Heat can also enable truly enthusiastic people to think about problems calmly, to come up with things that people in the past dared not imagine, so that the heat that was ridiculed as "fond of grandiose projects and eager for quick success" achieves actual success.

    Heat is the most precious thing. The universe must have heat, all things must have heat, the human body must have heat. Without heat, there is no vitality; if the heat is small, the vitality is small. Therefore, we must constantly stir up the wind to increase the heat. "Ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, twenty-four-point efforts" will always be our requirements for work.

    冷和热
    谢觉哉
    续范亭同志送毛主席的诗：
    领袖群伦不自高，静如处女动英豪。
    先生品质难为喻，“万古云霄一羽毛”。
    “静如处女”是冷，“动英豪”是热，冷和热是对立的，又是统一的。
    兵书上说：“始如处女，敌人开户；后如脱兔，敌不及拒。”习剑术的人，也有“静如处女，动若脱兔”的话。静是动的准备，也即冷是热的准备。只有冷静地分析了情况，研究了办法，然后动作起来，胸有把握，不是无源之热，经得起歪风，也不怕泼冷水。反过来，具有高度负责、不怕任何困难的“热”的人，也易于由热转到冷，寻求其各方面有利和不利的因素，定出前进的办法，以达到进一步的成功。
    “鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”。鼓足干劲、力争上游是热，没有冲天的热劲、争上游的决心，一切都无从谈起。但仅仅具有一股热，热里面并不就带来多快好省和取得上游。而这些，都需要科学分析，需要用脑子思考，反复地试验，客观地考察，才能得到。脑子要冷又要热，或者冷热同时，或者热了些时紧接来一段冷的时间，既能用热推进工作，又能以冷来检查与总结工作。
    冷与热是相需为用的，是统一性的对立面。只爱冷不爱热，说这是胡闹，那也不可能，想把人们的脚绊住，停在原地踏步。这样的人虽不多，也还有。如果他们死顽固，那就任他僵化好了。另外一种人只爱热不爱冷，这里面又有两种，一是忠心耿耿、一往直前。要上天，却不知道制造与使用“火箭”。这种人难免跌斤斗，可能经过一跌后，脑子清醒了，知道冷的用处了。但总是以不跌斤斗为好，跌总要吃亏的。尤其做领导工作的人，常常一跌使工作使人民受到较大损失。一是见大家都热呼呼，他也跟着热呼呼，只喊口号，不见行动，这是假热真冷，这样的热，我们不要。
    我国建设社会主义，“一天等于二十年”，任何工作都是跃进的。跃进就需要热，爱冷不爱热，是不可以的。比如农业，我国是很有经验的，但自来农业上的增产，只能是渐进，甚至经过很多年代仍停留在原来的地位，这是因为“农服先畴”，不敢打破常规，冷多而热少所致。现在不同了，人民要求解决迫切的吃穿问题，要求提前并超额实现四、五、八的纲领。于是过黄河、赶江南、千斤省、双千斤县、万斤亩的热潮出来了。于是水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管八字宪法出来了，前者是来自热，后者则来自冷，“冷”是被热逼成功的。“热”可以逼得喜冷的人也热起来，形势逼人，不热不可；热也可以使得真热的人善于冷静的思考问题；想出以前的人所不敢想的东西来，使被讥讽为“好大喜功”的热，得到了实际成功。
    热是最可宝贵的东西，宇宙要有热，万物要有热，人身要有热，没有热就没有活力，热小了活力就小，所以我们要不断地鼓动风力增强热，“十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲”，永远是我们工作的要求。
