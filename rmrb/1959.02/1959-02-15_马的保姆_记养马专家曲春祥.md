The Horse's Nanny
——A Record of Horse Breeding Expert Qu Chunxiang
By our reporters Cai Ming and Zhang Kaixin

In the herd of the state-owned Nongan Stud Farm, there is a stallion named Nongyou (Farmer Friend) No. 1 that mated with 1,200 mares in 1958, setting the highest national record for individual stallion mating. Whenever this horse is mentioned, people think of its breeder, Qu Chunxiang.

The Nongyou No. 1 stallion was originally a bad-tempered, difficult-to-train horse. If things didn't go its way, it would kick and bite, making all the keepers at the farm dislike it. Before Qu Chunxiang took over (in the spring of 1955), four keepers had been replaced. Because they had no patience with this horse, its temper not only did not improve from 1949 to the spring of 1955, but its physique gradually weakened, and its semen quality declined, seriously affecting the breeding work. At that time, the farm decided to hand this horse over to Communist Party member Qu Chunxiang to raise. Qu Chunxiang, this gentle, honest, and hardworking young man, felt uneasy when he heard that the farm was going to give him this vicious horse to raise. However, encouraged by Comrade Feng Shiming, the secretary of the farm's Party branch, he immediately accepted this task.

Qu Chunxiang walked into the stable, sized up "Nongyou," gently picked up a brush, and prepared to brush the horse, but the horse suddenly twisted its rear end and knocked him against a pillar. His brand-new cloth shirt was torn to shreds, his arm immediately swelled up, and a sour feeling surged into his heart. "I won't raise this horse, it might kick me to death one day!" The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became, and he went to see Secretary Feng again.

Secretary Feng knew that this horse was difficult to raise. But this was a good breed of horse from the Soviet Union, and it could not be eliminated because it was not well raised. Secretary Feng comforted Qu Chunxiang and told him stories of young heroes, asking him to learn from Luo Muming, who was blind, ...

Qu Chunxiang blushed at the thought of Luo Muming. What difficulty was it to tame a horse? So he resolved to tame this vicious horse.

After half a month of his training, "Nongyou" began to be friendly to him and allowed him to brush and trim its hooves. From then on, Qu Chunxiang's confidence in raising it increased. However, the horse's semen did not improve significantly. Qu Chunxiang knew that being able to approach "Nongyou" was only the beginning of the work, and the more important thing was how to make its semen abundant and of good quality. The key to improving the quantity and quality of semen was to ensure that the horse ate satisfying and palatable feed and exercised moderately. To achieve this, Qu Chunxiang always paid attention to mastering the horse's diet and activity patterns, and observing the horse's expressions and actions. During the mating season, in order to ensure that the horse ate juicy feed, he used his lunch and evening breaks to cut green grass in the wild.

After Qu Chunxiang's long-term patient feeding and management, this horse no longer kicked or jumped when it saw him, and allowed him to touch it anywhere. But Qu Chunxiang did not simply love the horse. He realized through practice that only by carefully feeding it, mastering its habits, and making it live happily can its semen be abundant and of good quality.

Proper exercise before semen collection is directly related to the quality of the semen. In order to explore the horse's exercise patterns, Qu Chunxiang always took note of the road conditions, the amount of exercise, the horse's expressions, and the quantity, density, and vitality of the collected semen after each walk, and constantly compared and improved them. Qu Chunxiang concluded from practice that the general experience is: to maintain the horse's flexibility and control its agitation, which can make the stallion fat, strong, and increase semen production.

Thanks to Qu Chunxiang's four years of careful feeding and patient training, not only has the temper of the Nongyou No. 1 stallion changed, but also the quality of the horse's semen has greatly improved. In 1958, the number of semen collections from this stallion had increased by nearly one time compared to 1954. The horse's weight also increased by more than one hundred pounds. In addition, the insemination technician Qiao Guoshi, who dared to think and dared to reduce the amount of insemination, and skillfully mastered the technology, since 1955, the number of matings of this horse has increased year by year, ranking first in the country every year.

Qu Chunxiang, this young man who had suffered all kinds of hardships since childhood, has been repeatedly named an advanced producer at the national, provincial, and county levels in recent years since liberation. He has met the great leader Chairman Mao three times. Recently, he was hired as a member of the Changchun Branch of the Chinese Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Society. Whenever he thinks of these honors, he always feels that his achievements are far from what the Party requires. In order to further repay the Party and the people for their concern for him, he is currently formulating this year's leap forward plan, preparing to continue to cooperate closely with insemination technician Qiao Guoshi, and striving to release a high-yield "satellite" of mating 10,000 heads by individual stallions this year.

    马的保姆
    ——记养马专家曲春祥
    本报记者　蔡明　张开欣
    在国营农安种马场的马群里，有一匹名叫农友号的种公马，1958年配种一千二百匹，创造了全国个体种公马配种最高纪录。一提起这匹马来，人们就想到它的饲养者曲春祥。
    农友号种公马原是一匹性情暴躁，难以调教的恶性马。一不随心，它就连踢带咬，弄得全场饲养员都讨厌它。在曲春祥接管它（1955年春）以前，一共调换了四个饲养员，由于他们对这匹马没有耐性，从1949年到1955年春，这匹马的脾气不但没有好转，而且体质逐渐瘦弱，精液下降。严重地影响了配种工作的进行。当时，场里决定把这匹马交给共产党员曲春祥饲养。曲春祥，这个性情温和，老实肯干的青年，听说场里要把这匹恶性马交给他饲养，心神不安了。可是他在场党支部书记冯世明同志鼓励下，立刻接受了这一工作。
    曲春祥走进马厩，把“农友”打量了一番，便轻轻地拿起刷子准备给那马刷洗刷洗，可是那匹马猛地一扭屁股，便把他撞到柱子上，崭新的布衫刮得稀烂，胳臂顿时红肿起来，一股酸水涌上了心头。“说什么也不饲养这匹马了，说不定那天会被它踢死呢！”他越想越怕，又找到了冯书记。
    冯书记知道这匹马难养。但这是从苏联来的好马种呀，不能因饲养不好，被淘汰掉。冯书记一面安慰曲春祥，一面讲些青年英雄的事迹给他听，要他向双目失明的罗木命学习，……。
    曲春祥一想到罗木命，不觉脸红了，马难调教，能算什么困难呢？于是决心驯服这匹恶性马。
    经过他的调教，半个月后，“农友”开始对他亲近了，肯让人刷洗、削蹄。从此，曲春祥增强了饲养的信心。但是，马的精液，并没有显著好转。曲春祥知道能够接近“农友”，只是工作的开始，更主要的是如何使它的精液量多质好。要提高精液的数量和质量，关键在于能使马吃到满意可口的饲料和运动适度。为了做到这点，曲春祥时刻注意掌握马的饮食和活动规律，观察马的表情和举动。在配种期间，为了使马吃到多汁的饲料，他就利用中午和晚上的休息时间，到野外割青草。
    经过曲春祥长期耐心地饲养管理，这匹马见到他不再踢蹦了，任何地方都让他触摸了。但曲春祥并不是单纯地爱马，他通过实践了解到只有精心饲养，掌握马的习性，使马生活得愉快，才能使精液量多质好。
    采精前的适当运动，直接关系到精液的好坏。曲春祥为了探索马的运动规律，每次蹓马以后，都注意记下道路的好坏，运动量的大小，马的表情及采下的精液数量、密度、活力等等，经常加以对比改进。曲春祥从实践中得出一条总的经验是：要保持马的灵活性，控制它的激动性，即可使种马膘肥、体壮、精液增加。
    由于曲春祥四年如一日的精心饲养，耐心调教，不仅使农友号种马的脾性改变了，而且使马的精液质量大为提高。1958年这匹种马的采精次数已比1954年提高了将近一倍。马的体重也增加了一百多斤。再加上授精技术员乔国仕敢想敢干大胆缩减输精量，和巧妙地掌握技术，自1955年以来，这匹马的配种头数逐年激增，年年名列全国第一。
    曲春祥，这个从小吃尽人间苦的青年，解放后几年来多次被评为全国、省、县的先进生产者。曾三次会见过伟大的领袖毛主席。最近他被聘为中国畜牧兽医学会长春分会会员。每当他想起这些荣誉时，都总觉得自己所做的成绩和党的要求相差很远。为了进一步报答党和人民对他的关怀，目前，他正在制定今年的跃进规划，准备继续和授精技术员乔国仕密切合作，力争今年放出个体种公马配种一万头的高产“卫星”。
