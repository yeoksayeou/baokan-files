After the visit, Duclos told a TASS reporter, "Now, when everyone is talking about conquering outer space, we have seen here with our own eyes the material resources for conquering outer space. We are confident that the Soviet Union will continue to shock the world in terms of science and technology in the future. We are particularly pleased that science and socialism are advancing simultaneously in order to achieve the main goal of communism."

The exhibition of fine arts from socialist countries, which opened at the Central Exhibition Hall in Moscow, also aroused great interest among the participants of the congress and the representatives of the fraternal communist and workers' parties.
