Vigorously Develop Recreational and Cultural Activities, Officers and Soldiers Celebrate Together
The People's Liberation Army Celebrates the Spring Festival Joyfully

Xinhua News Agency, 10th—This year, the various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army celebrated the Spring Festival more richly and vibrantly than in previous years. Over the past few days, from generals to soldiers, all gathered together, intimately discussing the Great Leap Forward and freely sharing their progress. Since the vigorous cultural revolution last year, the soldiers' performing arts teams, singing groups, and sports teams established in various units have all showcased their talents during the Spring Festival, enabling a full blossoming of recreational and cultural activities in the army.

In many units in the Beijing area, on the eve of the Lunar New Year, soldiers were not only making dumplings but also holding heart-to-heart talks. Veteran soldiers recalled their progress over the past year, new recruits talked about their feelings after joining the army, and officers and soldiers freely discussed new plans for the Great Leap Forward. The next morning, all units held grand celebrations. Senior Colonel Xiao Xuanjin of a certain unit congratulated everyone on the New Year and encouraged them to strive forward in the new year and achieve greater victories. In Guangdong, early in the morning of the 8th, many unit leaders got up, led office cadres to the companies to congratulate the soldiers on the New Year. The air force and artillery stationed in the coastal areas remained at their posts under the wings of their planes and on the front lines. Leaders made a special trip to the airport and the front lines to greet everyone, talk to them, and celebrate the festival together. The troops on the Fujian front cleaned their positions before the festival, and many local comfort groups, New Year visiting teams, and unit commanders beat drums and gongs to congratulate them. A certain air force unit also held a celebration and award ceremony at an airport, and thirty-seven flight and ground personnel who had contributed to combat and training were rewarded.

Many generals and officers who had returned to the ranks in various places prepared sumptuous meals and invited their comrades-in-arms from their time as soldiers to their homes as guests, happily discussing their work and studies since their separation. Some even went to the companies where they had served and celebrated the festival with their comrades-in-arms.

In the Shanghai garrison, every company held recreational evenings, movie nights, and some even held sports and shooting competitions and literary and artistic program performances. Most of the more than 30 programs performed by a certain company were created by the soldiers themselves. Before the festival, an amateur cartoon group from a certain unit also drew many wall paintings praising new people and new events to welcome the New Year, which were posted on the walls of the barracks. In the mass poetry and painting activities held by a certain regiment, a group of new "soldier poets" and "soldier painters" emerged. The hundred-member Spring Festival entertainment troupe organized by a certain company in the Beijing area performed a wide variety of programs, from stilt walking and land boat dancing to donkey riding, rich and colorful. On the Spring Festival special edition columns of the various unit wall newspapers, there were poems, essays, cartoons, and so on. The soldiers said: In these days of the Great Leap Forward, the songs of laughter are endless, and the heroic deeds are inexhaustible. A group of old generals from a certain military academy also organized a choir, singing from the Red Army era to the present day. At a poetry contest held by a certain unit, the soldiers happily sang: The birds sing on the branches to welcome the Spring Festival, singing the Great Leap Forward in 1958, urging the fast horse to whip again, and greater achievements will be made this year.
