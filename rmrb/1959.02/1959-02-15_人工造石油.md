    Artificial Oil Production
    Chuānlíu
    Artificial oil has an important position in China's oil industry. According to calculations, just starting with the comprehensive utilization of coal, several tens of millions of tons of oil can be obtained annually from the coal produced nationwide.
    How can oil be artificially created? We must first look at what oil is composed of. Actually, it's quite ordinary, just carbon and hydrogen, two substances that are found everywhere on Earth. However, carbon and hydrogen cannot combine under any circumstances, and the products of combination are not necessarily oil.
    The carbon and hydrogen in oil have their own specific relationships. In each oil molecule, carbon atoms are linked to each other by one bond, like a long chain. Each carbon atom also grasps two hydrogen atoms, and the carbon atoms at both ends of the chain each grasp three hydrogen atoms. In this way, the number of hydrogen atoms is always twice the number of carbon atoms plus two.
    However, having this combination relationship does not necessarily mean it is oil; it also depends on the length of the chain.
    If the chain is too short, for example, if only four or fewer carbon atoms are linked together, it becomes a gas instead of oil, usually called natural gas. Marsh gas is the most common type, with only one carbon atom, grasping four hydrogen atoms alone, with no other carbon atoms to grasp on either side. If the chain is too long, for example, if seventeen or more carbon atoms are linked together, it becomes a solid, such as paraffin wax.
    Only when the chain is neither too long nor too short, and the number of carbon atoms is between five and sixteen, is this compound of carbon and hydrogen a liquid under normal temperature and pressure. Among these liquid substances, the properties are not the same. Shorter chains are lighter gasoline, which is more valuable. Longer chains are heavier oils such as kerosene and diesel.
    Now we know that to obtain oil, we need enough hydrogen to combine with carbon, and at the same time, the chain formed between carbon atoms cannot be too short or too long.
    We can take those hydrocarbons that are deficient in hydrogen, or even carbonaceous substances that have no hydrogen at all, and add hydrogen to meet the requirements of the carbon atoms. For example, we can combine coal gas (carbon monoxide) with hydrogen, allowing hydrogen to replace the position of oxygen, and carbon can be recombined to obtain various hydrocarbons.
    Having satisfied the hydrogen needs of the carbon atoms, we must now solve the problem of chain length. Chains that are too short should be forced to combine together, such as synthesizing petroleum from natural gas. Chains that are too long should be forced to break apart, such as splitting petroleum residues and coal tar into petroleum.
    In this way, there are more raw materials that can be used to make oil. Natural gas, coal gas, and coal tar can all be used to make oil. Not to mention the oil distilled from oil shale, we can even directly combine coal powder and hydrogen to obtain raw materials for making oil. Recently, Chinese workers have extracted oil from vegetable oil sludge, rosin, and pine residue, because these substances contain a lot of carbon and hydrogen. There are many carbon-hydrogen-containing substances on Earth, so artificial oil has a great future.
    How can hydrogen and carbon be combined? And how can the chain be lengthened or shortened? This requires applying a certain temperature and pressure, and sometimes adding some substances to promote the change. These substances are called catalysts.
    These procedures are not mysterious. Zhengzhou, Changsha, and other places in China have already obtained sufficient temperature and pressure with simple equipment, causing vegetable oil sludge, rosin, and other substances to crack and produce oil.

    人工造石油
    川流
    人造石油在我国石油工业中有着重要的地位，据计算，仅从对煤的综合利用着手，每年就可以从全国生产的煤中拿到几千万吨石油。
    石油怎么能被人造出来呢？这得先看看石油是什么东西组成的。说来也平常，不过是碳和氢，这两种东西地球上到处都是。可是并不是在任何情况下碳和氢都能结合在一起，结合后的产物也不见得都是石油。
  石油中的碳和氢有它们自己的特定关系。在每一个石油的分子中，碳原子与碳原子之间彼此各用一只手拉着，像一根长长的链条。每一个碳原子又各自抓住两个氢原子，链条两端的碳原子还各自抓住三个氢原子，这样一来，氢原子的数目总是碳原子的两倍再加二。
    不过，并不是有了这种组合关系便是石油了，还得看链条的长短。
    链条太短，比如只有四个以下的碳原子拉在一起时，便成为气体，而不是油，通常叫作天然气。沼气就是最普遍的一种，它只有一个碳原子，孤独地抓住了四个氢原子，两旁别无碳原子可抓。链条太长，比如有十七个以上的碳原子拉在一起时，便成为固体，石蜡就是这类物质。
    只有链条不太长也不太短，碳原子的数目在五至十六之间时，这种碳和氢的化合物在常温常压下才是液体。在这些液体物质中，性能也不是一样的，链条较短的是体轻的汽油，价值较高。如果链条较长则是灯油、柴油等较重的油。
    现在我们知道，要得到石油，就需要有足够的氢与碳化合，同时碳原子之间形成的链条也不能太短或太长。
    我们可以把那些含氢不足的碳氢化合物甚至是完全没有氢的含碳物质拿来加进氢气，满足碳原子的要求。比如把煤气（一氧化碳）拿来和氢化合，让氢取代了氧的位置，碳也重新组合得到各种碳氢化合物。
    满足了碳原子的含氢需要，这时就要解决链条的长短问题。太短的，应该强迫它们组合在一起，例如将天然气合成石油。太长的，便强迫它们裂开，如将石油的残渣、煤焦油等分裂成石油。
    这样一来，能造石油的原料就多了，天然气、煤气、煤焦油都可以造石油，油页岩中干馏出来的油更不用说了，甚至能将煤粉和氢直接化合得到造石油的原料。最近我国工人在植物油泥、松脂、松渣中都炼出了石油，因为这些物质中都含有许多碳和氢。地球上含碳氢的物质多着哩，看来人造石油大有前途。
    怎样能使氢和碳结合呢？又怎样把链条加长或缩短呢？这需要施加一定的温度和压力，有时候还要加入一些物质促进变化的进行，这类物质就叫催化剂。
    这些手续并没有什么神秘，我国郑州、长沙等地都已经在简单的设备下得到了足够的温度和压力，使植物油泥、松脂等裂解，造出了石油。
