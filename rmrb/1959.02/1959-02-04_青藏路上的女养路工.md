    Female Road Maintenance Workers on the Qinghai-Tibet Road

    The first group of female road maintenance workers has appeared on the Huahaizi and Dachaidan maintenance sections of the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. They are the family members of the road crew workers, who came to the Qaidam Basin at the end of last year to participate in road maintenance work. They all love the road maintenance work very much. The female workers of the eighth and tenth road crews of the Huahaizi section are not weaker than the male workers in scraping "washboard" roads, loading, and unloading trucks, which has won the praise of the truck drivers.

    With the addition of these female road maintenance workers on this 400-kilometer route, a group of male workers has been able to be transferred to more needed positions such as coal mining and iron smelting, accelerating the development work along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. (Shen Shiren)

    青藏路上的女养路工
    在青藏公路北段的花海子和大柴旦两个养护段上，出现了第一批女养路工人。她们是道班工人的家属，去年年底来到柴达木盆地，参加了养路工作。她们都十分热爱养路工作。花海子段第八道班、第十道班的女工们，无论刮“搓板”、装车、卸车，都不弱于男工，赢得了汽车驾驶员的称赞。
    在这四百公里的线路上，由于增加了这些女养路工，就使得一批男工能够插到采煤、炼铁等更需要的岗位上去，加速青藏公路沿线的开发工作。（沈世纫）
