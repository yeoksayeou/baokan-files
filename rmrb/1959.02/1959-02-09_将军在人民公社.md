Under the leadership of the General, we came to Hengshui County to help commune members rectify the people's commune.

We have been away from Xujiazhuang, Hengshui, for twelve years! Twelve years ago, the Third Detachment of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region University, led by Political Commissar Jia, spent unforgettable years in Xujiazhuang. Now, under the leadership of the General, we have returned to this long-separated home. The winding path of twelve years ago has now become a straight avenue wide enough for three trucks to run side by side. On both sides of the avenue are dense, green wheat fields. Not far to the right is the newly built middle school, and further ahead is the Red and Expert School. A little further, many scaffolding structures are erected, piled with bricks and tiles, and new houses are being built. These are one of the five new residential points for the more than 60,000 commune members of the commune. Some have already been built and fitted with glass windows. In a little while, when the commune members move into their new homes, the old Xujiazhuang will be hard to find.

As soon as the General arrived in Xujiazhuang, he went to visit the families of revolutionary martyrs. Liu Zhenguo, a martyr's family member, is over sixty years old, with a short beard and a constant smile. Four plaques hang in the house, three reading "Loves Soldiers Like His Own Sons" and one reading "Sends Sons to Join the Army," all given by the army. Back then, Captain Xu of the Military University fell ill here, and Grandpa Liu's mother, Grandma Song, took care of him like her own son, feeding him and cleaning him, until Captain Xu was out of danger. Now that Grandma Song has passed away, Captain Xu is far away in the Northeast, but he still writes often and sends photos to Grandpa Liu. Grandpa Liu's son, Liu Qingxiao, joined the army in 1947 and died in the Huaihai Campaign. His second son, Little Liu, drives a cart in the commune. In 1957, he contracted lung disease, and the government paid for him to receive seventy or eighty injections of streptomycin to cure him. Now, Grandpa Liu divides these seventy or eighty small bottles into two strings and hangs them below the portrait of Chairman Mao. When the General asked him if he had any difficulties, he said, "I have no difficulties. I can never repay the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in my lifetime." As he spoke, he teased his grandson, who was not yet three years old, "Who gives you happiness?" The child clearly said, "Chairman Mao." He asked again, "Who is good?" The child said with a smile, "The Communist Party is good."

The work team led by the General started working as soon as they put down their baggage, doing heavy work, driving the plow, and pulling large carts to deliver manure to the fields, making sure to complete the county committee's requirement of applying 30,000 catties of fertilizer per mu of wheat. The General also refused to admit he was old. He took off his General's uniform, put on a blue cotton jacket, and appeared on the construction site of the new houses with County Chief Gu. County Chief Gu pushed, the General pulled, and the carts full of bricks were transported to the construction site. More than a thousand commune members building new houses gathered around, looking at the General, who was covered in sweat, and said, "Look, the leader has come to take command!" A group of young men gathered around, arguing with the General and the County Chief for the cart. "Take a break, you're both so old! We can do this work!" The General wiped away his sweat and said with a smile, "Don't think I'm old, I come from the working people too, I can do it!" It is said that the General even won a labor medal when he was building the Ming Tombs Reservoir. However, the young men eventually took the cart away. The General had to carry bricks with County Chief Gu, carrying more than thirty bricks at a time. The old ladies from the home for the elderly also ran to the construction site and said with a smile, "I heard the General is carrying bricks, so I came to see." The General asked an old lady with a smile, "Are these houses good?" The old lady pursed her lips and smiled, "I'd be happy to live in this house for three nights, even if I die. So I come to see it every day." The General said to the comrades of the work team, "Building such good houses is the long-cherished wish of the working people. We must do our part, even if it's just adding a brick or a tile."

One day, when the General heard that five demobilized soldiers had started a livestock farm from scratch in Xisha River, he went to visit them. Xisha River was desolate, even the wind was black. When the wind blew, you couldn't see your fingers. Except for rabbits and pheasants, no one ever came to this 6,000-mu wasteland before. Here, the General met Secretary Zhang, who was almost blind, and the female factory director, Ma Fufeng. The General asked about the secretary's name, and he said it was "Zhang Jiejun." The General asked again, "Which 'Jie'?" He replied, "The 'Jie' of hero (英雄豪杰)." The General looked at them and said, "You are the real heroes." Indeed! They fought against the barren sand and black wind for eight months, and now eighty-one people are working and living here. The integrated livestock farm that has been built here has 330 pigs, 72 sheep, 5 rams, 42 dairy cows, and 51 beehives; there are 1,720 chickens in Wanjitan; there is also a vermicelli processing factory, a coarse feed processing factory, and an artificial insemination station. The veterinary drug factory can already produce twelve kinds of veterinary drugs such as chlortetracycline. On the 3,200 mu of sandy alkaline land that has been reclaimed, in addition to 530 mu of windbreak forest, more than 6,700 pear, apple, peach, jujube, mulberry, walnut and other fruit trees of more than ten varieties have been planted.

When the General asked Comrade Zhang Jiejun why he couldn't even see five fingers with his eyes, he said, "I was injured by a shell in 1939 when we attacked Pengcheng!" It turned out that the 386th Brigade of the 129th Division, led by Marshal Liu Bocheng, attacked Pengcheng at that time, and the director of the division's political department was Comrade Cai Shufan, who passed away last year. The General was in this brigade at that time. Therefore, the General said excitedly, "We are old comrades-in-arms." Zhang Jiejun excitedly talked to the General about, "I have seen Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Division Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and Director Cai, but I have never seen Chairman Mao." They talked for a long time, about everything after they separated. Before leaving, the General said to him kindly, "You have been an old revolutionary for more than twenty years. You have always been a good Party member with a strong Party spirit. I hope you will continue to work hard and make greater contributions to the cause of the Party." Zhang Jiejun was very excited. He said, "I will definitely listen to the Party and strive to see Chairman Mao. Although my eyes are bad and I can't see clearly, how happy I would be if I could stand next to Chairman Mao!"

    将军在人民公社
    洪升  辰戈
    我们在将军的率领下，来到衡水县帮助社员整顿人民公社。
    我们离别衡水徐家庄已经十二年了！十二年前晋冀鲁豫军大三大队在贾政委率领下，就在徐家庄渡过了难忘的岁月。如今，又在将军率领下回到这阔别已久的家。十二年前那条弯曲小路，现在已成了可以并行三辆卡车的笔直的大道了。大道两旁是密密的绿油油的麦田，右边不远是新建的中学，再往前是红专学校。里把路以外，搭着许多脚手架，堆满砖瓦，正在建造住宅，这是公社六万多社员的五个新居民点之一。有些已经造好，安上了玻璃窗。再过些时候，当社员乔迁新居，那旧日的徐家庄也将难以找到了。
    将军一到徐家庄，就去探望烈军属。烈属刘振国，六十多岁了，留着短胡子，总是笑嘻嘻的。屋里挂着四块匾，三块是“爱兵如子”，一块是“送儿参军”，都是部队送的。当年，军大的徐队长在这里病倒了，刘大爷的母亲宋老大娘，一把屎，一把尿，就像照顾亲儿一样，终于使徐队长转危为安。如今宋老大娘已去世了，徐队长远在东北，还常来信，给刘大爷寄来照片。刘大爷的儿子刘清肖，1947年入伍，在淮海战役中牺牲了。二儿子小刘，在公社里赶车。他在1957年害肺病，政府掏钱给打了七、八十针链霉素才治好。现在，刘大爷把这七、八十个小瓶子分成两串，挂在毛主席像的下边。当将军问他老人家还有什么困难的时候，他说：“没有困难。毛主席和共产党的恩，我一辈子也报不完。”说着，他逗那不满三岁的小孙子：“谁给你福？”孩子清楚地说：“毛主席。”他又问：“谁好？”孩子笑着说：“共产党好。”
    将军率领的工作队，一放下被包就去劳动，干重活，驾辕，拉大车往地里送粪，一定要完成县委要求一亩小麦盖肥三万斤的任务。将军也不服老，脱了将军服，穿一件蓝棉袄，和谷县长一起，出现在建设新住宅的工地上。谷县长推，将军拉，那满满的一车车的砖都运到施工地点了。一千多建筑新住宅的社员都围拢来，望着满头大汗的将军说：“你们看，首长来挂帅来了！”一群小伙子围上来，跟将军、县长争车子。“歇歇吧，你们年纪这么大了！这活有我们干就行了！”将军挥汗笑道：“别看我年纪大，我也是劳动人民出身，干得了！”据说，修十三陵水库时，将军还得过劳动奖章呢。可是，小伙子终究还是把车子夺走了。将军只得和谷县长一同去抬砖，一次抬三十多块。敬老院的老太太也跑到工地上来，笑咪咪地说：“听说将军来背砖，我也来看看。”将军笑着问一位老太太：“这样房子好不好？”老太太抿着嘴笑：“这房子叫我住三晚上，我死了也满意。所以我天天跑来看看。”将军对工作队同志说：“建立这么好的住宅，是劳动人民多年热望，我们一定要出分力，哪怕只添上一砖一瓦。”
    有一天，将军听说有五位复员军人在西沙河白手起家建立了畜牧场时，就前去拜访。西沙河一片荒凉，连风都是黑的，大风一起，伸手不见五指，除兔子、野鸡外，以前什么人也不到这六千亩荒地来。将军在这儿见到双目几乎失明的张支书和女厂长马伏凤。将军问起支书的名字，他说是“张杰君”。将军又问：“哪个‘杰’？”他回答：“英雄豪杰的杰！”将军望着他们二人说：“你们就是真正的英雄豪杰。”的确如此！他们和荒沙黑风搏斗了八个月，现在已有八十一人在这里劳动和生活了。这里建成的综合畜牧场，有三百三十口猪，七十二只绵羊，五只公羊，四十二头奶牛，五十一箱蜜蜂；在万鸡滩有一千七百二十只鸡；还设有粉条加工厂，粗饲料加工厂，人工授精站，兽药制造厂已能生产金霉素等十二种兽药。在被开垦的三千二百亩沙碱地上，除五百三十亩防风林外，种了六千七百棵梨、苹果、桃、枣、桑、核桃等十多种果树。
    当将军问到张杰君同志眼睛为什么连五个手指也看不清时，他说：“1939年打彭城时被炮弹震伤的！”原来，当时打彭城是刘伯承元帅率领的一二九师三八六旅，师政治部主任就是去年逝世的蔡树藩同志，将军当时就在这个旅。因此，将军兴奋地说：“我们是老战友了。”张杰君兴奋地和将军谈着：“我见过朱总司令，刘师长，邓政委，蔡主任，就是还没见过毛主席。”他们一直谈了很久，谈了分别后的一切。临别时，将军亲切地对他说：“你是二十多年的老革命了，你一直是党性很强的好党员，希望你继续努力，为党的事业作出更大贡献。”张杰君很激动，他说：“我一定听党的话，努力争取去见见毛主席。虽然我眼睛坏了，看不清了，可是我要能在毛主席身边站站，那该多幸福啊！”
