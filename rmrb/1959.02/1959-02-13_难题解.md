Title: Solving the Difficult Problem

    "Does the material obey the Great Leap Forward, or does the Great Leap Forward obey the material?" This is a question that the workers of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory encountered in their debates during the blooming and contending period. This year is the decisive year of the three years of hard struggle, and the Great Leap Forward must leap again and again; however, the materials needed by the Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory are relatively special. In this kind of factory, the situation of insufficient materials and incomplete specifications is often encountered.

    How to solve this difficult problem?

    If it is said that the Great Leap Forward can disregard the availability of materials and the completeness of specifications, that is not being realistic. Industrial products must be processed with raw materials; they cannot be created "out of nothing." This is an objective law that cannot be shifted by people's will. No matter how firm our revolutionary will is, no matter how strong our determination for the Great Leap Forward is, we must respect this objective law. Otherwise, even if we have the determination to make a Great Leap Forward, it will be difficult to achieve practical results.

    In this case, should it be "the Great Leap Forward obeys the material"? More materials, more Great Leap Forward; fewer materials, less Great Leap Forward; no materials, no Great Leap Forward? The answer is: no. Acknowledging that objective laws cannot be shifted by people's will does not mean that people are powerless in the face of objective laws and have no subjective initiative. If that were the case, people would become slaves to objective laws, and objective laws would become idols. While we acknowledge that objective laws cannot be shifted by people's will, we also acknowledge that people are not powerless in the face of objective laws. In the face of objective laws, people's subjective initiative has a wide range of activities. Emphasizing respect for objective laws is not to bind people's subjective initiative, but to better exert people's subjective initiative, so that the subjective is consistent with the objective, to promote the development of objective things. The Great Leap Forward in industrial production cannot be without materials; this is an objective law. Thinking that a Great Leap Forward can be made without solving the material problem is just a subjective fantasy. However, the problem of insufficient materials and incomplete specifications can be solved by revising designs, improving technological methods, finding substitutes, and economizing on materials. This is the role of people's subjective initiative. It is wrong to fail to see this subjective initiative and think that there is no way to solve the material problem and that one can only "the Great Leap Forward obeys the material."

    Correctly understanding the relationship between people's subjective initiative and objective laws is an issue we must always pay attention to in our practical work. Violating objective laws and exaggerating people's subjective initiative, thinking that we can do whatever we think of, easily leads to "leftist" errors. Only seeing that objective laws cannot be shifted by people's will and failing to see the role of people's subjective initiative easily leads to rightist errors. How to answer the current difficult problem in industrial production of "does the material obey the Great Leap Forward, or does the Great Leap Forward obey the material" depends on whether we correctly understand the relationship between subjective initiative and objective laws. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory correctly answered this difficult problem, proving that a Great Leap Forward can still be made even with insufficient materials and incomplete specifications. The key is not to avoid the material problem, but to face the material problem squarely, present it to the workers for blooming and contending debates, and exert people's subjective initiative to solve the material problem, creating conditions that were not originally available to achieve a greater Great Leap Forward.

    Difficult problems similar to the material problem include the equipment problem, the technical strength problem, and so on. These difficult problems are all brought about by the situation of a greater Great Leap Forward this year, which is a good thing. After a year of the Great Leap Forward last year, the material strength and technical strength of our country's industrial front are stronger than in the past, but they only appear to be insufficient under the situation of a greater Great Leap Forward this year. Solving these difficult problems also depends on whether we correctly understand the relationship between subjective initiative and objective laws.

    难题解
    吴滤
    “是材料服从跃进，还是跃进服从材料？”这是哈尔滨量具刃具厂的职工在鸣放辩论中接触到的一个问题。今年是苦战三年中决定性的一年，跃进必须一跃再跃；但是，量具刃具厂需要的材料又比较特殊，在这种工厂里，往往会碰到材料不足、规格不全的情况。
    这难题怎样解决呢？
    若说跃进可以不顾及材料的有无、规格的齐缺，那是不实事求是的。工业产品要用原材料加工，不能“无中生有”。这是不以人们的意志为转移的客观规律。我们的革命意志不管有多么坚决，跃进的决心不管有多么坚强，都必须尊重这个客观规律。否则，虽有跃进的决心，也难收跃进的实效。
    这样说来，应该是“跃进服从材料”了，材料多就多跃进，材料少就少跃进，没有材料就不跃进？答曰：否。承认客观规律不以人们的意志为转移，并不是说人们在客观规律的面前就无能为力、没有任何主观能动性了。如果是那样的话，人就成了客观规律的奴隶，就把客观规律偶像化了。我们承认客观规律不以人们的意志为转移，同时也承认人们在客观规律的面前并不是无能为力的。在客观规律的面前，人们的主观能动性有广阔的活动余地，强调尊重客观规律，并不是要束缚人们的主观能动性，而是要更好地发挥人们的主观能动性，使主观同客观一致，来促进客观事物的发展。工业生产的跃进不可没有材料，这是客观规律。以为不解决材料问题也能跃进，不过是主观上的空想。但是，材料不足、规格不全，可以用修改设计、改进工艺方法、找代用品、节约用料等办法去解决，这是人们的主观能动性的作用。看不到这种主观能动作用，以为材料问题自己根本没有办法解决，只能“跃进服从材料”，是错误的。
    正确地认识人们的主观能动性同客观规律的关系，是我们在实际工作中时时都要注意的问题。违反客观规律，夸大了人们的主观能动性，以为想到那儿就能做到那儿，容易犯“左”的错误。只看到客观规律不以人们的意志为转移，看不到人们的主观能动作用，容易犯右的错误。怎样回答目前工业生产上“是材料服从跃进，还是跃进服从材料”的难题，就看我们是不是正确地认识了主观能动性同客观规律的关系。哈尔滨量具刃具厂正确地解答了这个难题，证明了材料不足，规格不全，还是可以跃进的。关键在于不是回避材料问题，而是正视材料问题，把它拿出来交给职工鸣放辩论，发挥人们的主观能动性去解决材料问题，创造本来还不具备的实现更大跃进的条件。
    同材料问题类似的难题，还有设备问题、技术力量问题等等。这些难题都是今年实现更大跃进的形势带来的，是好事。经过去年一年的大跃进，我们国家工业战线上的物质力量，技术力量都比过去强大了，只是在今年更大跃进的形势下才显得不足。解决这些难题，也都看我们是不是正确认识了主观能动性同客观规律的关系。
