Modern Ideal Materials - Synthetic Materials
Zheng Ping

To develop production at high speed and build socialism, in terms of materials, there are always two basic requirements: materials and energy. Socialist construction requires not only a large quantity and variety of materials but also high quality, capable of simultaneously meeting the requirements of broad industrial and agricultural production and cutting-edge technological development. Synthetic materials are the most ideal materials to meet these requirements.

Synthetic materials usually refer to synthetic products of the organic chemical industry, such as plastics, synthetic rubber, synthetic fibers, dyes, synthetic liquid fuels, etc. They not only replace and save large amounts of familiar raw materials such as metals, glass, wood, etc., but also increasingly satisfy the new performance requirements for materials brought about by the development of production technology. These new performance requirements cannot be solved by relying solely on the "old" materials. Synthetic materials have a wide range, and here we will focus on polymer materials, which can also be said to be synthetic structural materials.

Listing all the uses of polymer materials would be endless. From rockets soaring into space to the things around everyone, they can be found. Without these things, the vast majority of modern technology would be impossible, and life would become dim and dull.

Rocket and jet technology can be said to be the pinnacle of modern science and technology, and plastics are of great importance in these areas. Under extremely high-speed flight conditions, the surface of a rocket can reach the temperature of the sun's surface in an instant due to friction with the air. At such high temperatures, any metal will vaporize, and only certain reinforced plastics can withstand this test. Taking aviation flight as an example, it also requires many synthetic materials. On the Soviet Tu-104 jet airliner, more than 10,000 parts are made of polymer materials. Some parts cannot be manufactured without polymer materials. For example, the radome of the radar antenna on an aircraft can only be made of reinforced plastic that is "transparent" to electromagnetic waves; no other material will do. Other new technologies, such as radar and television, would not be successful without materials with excellent electrical insulation and dielectric properties, such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene.

Synthetic materials also have great potential in the electrical and mechanical industries. In the electrical industry, polymer materials are mainly used as insulation materials. What is particularly worth mentioning here is organic silicon compounds. Not only do they have good insulation performance, but they are also heat-resistant. Generators and motors made with silicone paint, silicone rubber, and other materials as insulation can be used continuously at high temperatures of about 200 degrees Celsius, which greatly increases the power output of the motors. According to estimates, if organic silicon is used as an insulation material for the construction of 10 million kilowatts of power generation equipment, 700,000 tons of steel, 150,000 tons of copper, and 200,000 tons of silicon steel sheets can be saved. In addition to organic silicon compounds, vinyl chloride plastics, styrene plastics, polyethylene plastics, epoxy resins, butyl rubber, etc., also play important roles in electrical insulation. The application of polymer materials in mechanical power is also very extensive. Using plastics as new structural materials can not only reduce the weight of machines and equipment, but also because parts can be manufactured using molding methods such as pressing or die-casting, manufacturing is faster and costs are lower compared to metals. Many plastic products are widely used in the manufacture of parts in hydraulic turbines, rolling mills, and conveyor belts. In some heavily loaded machines such as rolling mills and the main shaft bearings of large seagoing vessels, using plastic is more durable than using metal. In the machinery industry, in addition to directly using plastics to make parts, their role in protecting machines should not be overlooked. Many polymer materials are also used in the manufacturing of covering films and protective coatings for packaging machines and rust-proof coatings directly applied to machine parts. Here, synthetic rubber should not be forgotten; without rubber, mechanization, electrification, and modern transportation would be impossible. Just to illustrate, manufacturing a truck requires about a quarter of a ton of rubber. Natural rubber is always in short supply, and its performance is also limited to a certain extent, which requires the mass production of synthetic rubber to make up for its shortcomings. Synthetic rubber can also be modified by changing its chemical structure to achieve the desired performance. For example, a synthetic nitrile rubber is oil-resistant, which natural rubber does not have.

The application prospects of polymer materials in construction engineering and the chemical industry are also very broad. A polyester plastic reinforced with glass fiber can replace steel bars. Its tensile strength is no less than that of steel bars of the same thickness, but its weight is only one-fourth or one-fifth of that of steel bars. Reinforced plastics with a composition similar to the above-mentioned steel bar substitutes can be made into transparent tiles, which would be great for making the roofs of large buildings. Various foamed plastics have also been developing rapidly recently. Their specific gravity is only one-tenth or even 1% of that of water, but they still maintain good load-bearing capacity. These inexpensive and high-quality materials are extremely ideal for thermal and sound insulation. Many water conservancy projects require the construction of dams. In the past, a large amount of copper was always used to make water-stop sheets to prevent water leakage in the construction of dams. Now, these water-stop sheets can be manufactured with inexpensive polyethylene, saving expensive copper materials. The most economical way to transport petroleum is to lay oil pipelines, but if steel is used to make oil pipelines, the consumption would be staggering. Now, this type of oil pipeline can be successfully manufactured using a so-called "polymer alloy" of polystyrene and nitrile rubber. Some people even predict that this "alloy" can be used to manufacture steel rails, which would save tens of thousands of tons of steel! The application of polymer materials in chemical equipment is also booming. Many plastics are superior to metal materials in terms of resistance to chemical corrosion. Therefore, many tanks and troughs for storing chemical raw materials, as well as pipelines for transportation, can be built with plastics. One ton of asbestos phenolic plastic can be used in place of five to six tons of lead. Polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene pipes are used extensively for transporting liquids. A furfuryl alcohol plastic reinforced with glass cloth is both acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, making it a good material for manufacturing chemical equipment. In addition, many filter cloths used in the chemical industry are composed of synthetic fibers.

The application of polymer materials in agricultural production also has great potential. Using polyethylene film to cover wooden frames to build greenhouses will be much lighter and more economical than using glass. It is even possible to cover entire fields of crops with polyethylene film to prevent moisture evaporation and resist the threat of drought. In this regard, a new type of plastic may emerge to compete with polyethylene, which is polyformaldehyde. Polyformaldehyde is no less inferior to polyethylene in terms of abundant raw materials and ease of manufacturing, and it may be even more durable than polyethylene.

From the above simple introduction, it can be seen that to raise my country's industry and technology to the world's advanced ranks, a strong synthetic materials industry is indispensable. In the world's industrially advanced countries, the synthetic materials industry is very developed. However, after detailed examination of their technical routes, most of them are based on minerals; some mainly rely on coal, some mainly rely on petroleum and natural gas, and some focus on both. These routes based on mineral raw materials are also important for our country, especially as we must pay good attention to the comprehensive utilization of coal. The problem is that some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, although our country's reserves are very rich, it will still take time to develop them on a large scale. If we simply wait for the development of these minerals, it will delay the time for us to build a synthetic materials industry. Because the people of our country have found a way to develop agricultural production at high speed, we can break the outdated view that using agricultural products as raw materials is uneconomical and create a unique agricultural chemical "indigenous" route in the construction of the synthetic materials industry. To prove the importance and reality of this route, just one example is enough. According to estimates, if 20 million mu of land are used to grow sweet potatoes, with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu, and all of them are used to manufacture alcohol and used as raw materials for plastics and synthetic rubber, 1.5 million tons of rubber and 3.5 million tons of plastics can be produced. This quantity greatly exceeds the current annual output of the United States. From this, it can be seen that under the leadership of the Party, as long as we go all out and adopt the two-pronged approach of combining "indigenous" and "foreign" methods, it is entirely possible to build my country's synthetic materials industrial system at high speed in a short period of time.

    现代的理想材料——合成材料
    郑平
    为了高速度的发展生产，建设社会主义，物质方面总离不开两项基本要求——材料和能源。社会主义建设对材料的要求，不单是数量大、品种多，而且要求质量高，能同时满足广大工农业生产建设和尖端技术发展的要求。合成材料，就是满足这种要求的最理想的材料。
    所谓合成材料，通常是指那些有机化学工业的合成产品，例如：塑料、合成橡胶、合成纤维、染料、合成液体燃料等等，它们不仅代替和节约了大量我们熟知的原材料如金属、玻璃、木材等等，而且越来越多地满足了和满足着生产技术发展所带来的对材料的新的性能的要求，这些新的性能要求，单靠那些“老”的材料是无法解决的。合成材料的范围很广，这里着重的谈一谈高分子材料，也可以说是合成的结构材料。
    要列举高分子材料所有的用途，是列举不完的，从遨游太空的火箭到每个人的身边都可以找到它们的踪影，没有这些东西，绝大部分现代技术是不可能有的，生活将变得晦暗无光。
    火箭和喷气技术可以说是现代科学技术尖端的顶峰，就在这些方面，塑料有极大的重要性。在极高速度飞行的条件下，火箭的表面和空气摩擦可以瞬息间达到太阳表面的温度，在这样高温下，任何金属都将气化，只有某些增强塑料可以经受得住这种考验。再拿航空飞行来说，也需要很多合成材料。苏联图—104喷气客机上，有一万多个零件是高分子材料做成的。有些部件，没有高分子材料就不能制造，例如，飞机上雷达天线的罩子就只能用对电磁波“透明”的增强塑料，别的材料是不行的。其他一些新技术，例如雷达和电视，要是没有诸如聚四氟乙烯、聚乙烯等电绝缘和解电性能极好的材料，也是不可能成功的。
    在电气和机械工业方面，合成材料也大有作为。电气工业方面，高分子材料主要被用作绝缘材料。这里特别值得一提的是有机硅化合物，它们非但绝缘性能好，而且耐热，用硅漆、硅橡胶等作绝缘材料的发电机和电动机，可以在摄氏二百度左右的高温下连续使用，这就大大提高了电机的使用功率。根据估算建设一千万瓩的发电设备，若是采用有机硅作绝缘材料的话，就可以节省钢七十万吨，铜十五万吨和硅钢片二十万吨。除了有机硅化合物，氯乙烯塑料、苯乙烯塑料、聚乙烯塑料、环氧树脂、丁基橡胶等在电气绝缘方面也都扮演了重要角色。高分子材料在机械动力方面的应用也是非常广泛的。采用塑料作为新的结构材料，不仅可以减轻机器和设备的重量，而且因为可以采用压制或压铸等成型方法来制造零件，因此，和金属相比，制造快、成本也低，许多塑料制品在制造水力透平、轧钢机、运输带等方面，被广泛用来制造零件，在某些负荷很重的机器如轧钢机和大海轮的主轴轴承，用塑料来做比用金属来做要经久耐用得多。在机器工业方面，除了直接采用塑料做部件外，也不应该忽视它们在保护机器方面的作用。在制造包装机器的复盖膜罩和直接涂在机件上的防锈涂层，同样用了不少高分子材料。这里还不应该把合成橡胶忘掉，没有橡胶，机械化、电气化和现代交通运输是不可能的。举个例就可以清楚，制造一辆卡车，大约就要用四分之一吨的橡胶。天然橡胶，总是不够用，而且性能上也受到一定的限制，这就需要大量生产合成橡胶来补其不足。合成橡胶还可以借改变其化学结构来达到人们预期的性能，例如一种合成的丁腈橡胶，能够耐油，天然橡胶就没有这种本领。
    高分子材料在建筑工程和化学工业方面应用的前途，也非常远大。一种用玻璃丝增强的聚脂塑料，可以代替钢筋，它的抗张强度不比同样粗的钢筋差，但是它的重量只有钢筋的四五分之一。成分和上述钢筋代用品相仿的增强塑料，可以做成透明的瓦，用它们来做大建筑物的顶棚那是好极了。最近发展得很快的还有各种泡沫塑料，它们比重只有水的十分之一，甚至1％，但仍保有很好的承重力。用这些价廉物美的材料来隔热隔音，极其理想。许多水利工程中要建造水坝，为了防止水的渗漏，以往造水坝中总要用大量铜来做止水片，现在这些止水片可以用价钱低廉的聚乙烯来制造，节约昂贵的铜料。输送石油最经济的办法是敷设油管，但是若是用钢铁来做输油管的话，用量非常惊人。现在这种输油管可以成功地用一种聚苯乙烯和丁腈橡胶的所谓“高分子合金”来制造。有人甚至预言，这种“合金”可以制造钢轨，那该能节约多少万吨钢材啊！在化工设备中应用高分子材料，也正在蓬勃发展，许多塑料在耐化学品浸蚀方面比金属材料更优越。因此，许多贮存化工原料的罐、槽以及输送的管道等都可以用塑料来建造。一吨石棉酚醛塑料能够抵五六吨铅用，用聚氯乙烯与聚乙烯做输送液体的管子，是用途很多的。一种用玻璃布增强的糠醇塑料，既耐酸又耐碱，真是制造化工设备的好材料。还有化工中用得很多的滤布，不少是用合成纤维组成的。
    高分子材料在农业生产方面应用，也有很大的可能性。用聚乙烯的薄膜蒙在木架上来建造温室，将比用玻璃轻便经济得多，甚至整片谷物田用聚乙烯薄膜蒙罩起来，防止水分蒸发，抵抗干旱威胁，也不是没有可能的。在这方面有一种新兴的塑料可能出来与聚乙烯一争长短，那就是聚甲醛。聚甲醛在原料丰富和制造容易方面不比聚乙烯差，在耐用方面或许比聚乙烯更好。
    从上面简单的介绍中，可以看到，要把我国的工业和技术提高到世界先进行列，没有强大的合成材料工业是不行的。世界上工业先进的国家，合成材料工业都是很发达的。但详细考察一下他们的技术路线，大都是以矿物作为基础的，有的主要靠煤，有的主要靠石油和天然气，也有两者兼重。这些以矿物原料为基础的路线，对我国说来也是重要的，特别是我们要好好重视煤的综合利用。问题是有些矿藏如石油和天然气，我国储量虽也十分丰富，但是要大量开发尚需时日，如果单纯等待这些矿藏的开发，将会延迟我们建设合成材料工业的时日。由于我国人民找到了一条高速度发展农业生产的道路，因此，我们在建设合成材料工业方面，可以打破认为用农产品作原料不经济的陈腐观点，创造一条独特的农业化学“土”路线。要证明这条路线的重要性和现实性，只要举一个例子就够了。据估算，假如用二千万亩土地种红薯，每亩产一万斤，全部用来制造酒精并作为塑料和合成橡胶原料的话，就可以制成一百五十万吨橡胶和三百五十万吨塑料。这个数量大大超过目前美国的年产量。由此可见，我们在党的领导下，只要鼓足干劲，采取“土”、“洋”结合两条腿走路的方针，是完全有可能以高速度在短时间内把我国的合成材料工业体系建设起来的。
