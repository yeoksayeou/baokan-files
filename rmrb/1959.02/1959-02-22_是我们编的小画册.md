    It's Our Little Picture Book
    The article "The Smallest Picture Book" in the supplement of January 25 mentioned that the little picture book was published by the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which may be an oversight by the writer. This type of folding picture book was initially published in ten versions by the Shanghai Pictorial Publishing House. Last winter, we felt that this format was very good, and we also published twelve versions successively, called "Little Friends' Little Picture Books." The stories mentioned in the article about children's struggle against the enemy, "I Followed My Father to Be a Red Army Soldier," and the story praising the Lebanese children's struggle against the enemy, "The Little Hero of Lebanon," were published by our agency. From this year on, all the little picture books have been published by our agency.

    是我们编的小画册
    1月25日副刊上的“最小的画册”一文，提到小画册是上海人民美术出版社出版的，这可能是笔者的疏忽。这类折叠式小画册，最初由上海画片出版社出过十种，去年冬天，我们感到这一形式很好也先后出了十二种，名为“小朋友小画册”。文中提到的关于描绘儿童对敌斗争的故事“我跟爸爸当红军”及歌颂黎巴嫩儿童对敌斗争的故事“黎巴嫩小英雄”，就是由我社出版的。从今年起，小画册已全部由我社出版。“小朋友”编辑委员会
