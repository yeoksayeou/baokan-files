War Drums Greet the Spring
By our Shanghai Correspondent

    The war drums for an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 are resounding throughout Shanghai. After scoring a remarkable first victory in production in January, the city's 1.2 million industrial workers are advancing towards even higher goals. They are determined to create magnificent achievements in February, the month with the fewest production days. As the Spring Festival approaches, new drive, new challenges, new creations, and new achievements are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, vying to be the most beautiful flowers.

        Competing Intelligently to Rush Produce Rolling Mills

    We had just started our interview in the director's office of the Jingye Machine Factory when a burst of gongs and drums echoed from downstairs. Comrade Hua Yang, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, hurried out to greet them. It turned out that the entire staff of the assembly squad in Workshop One had come to deliver great news. The squad had already completed its task of assembling the frames for three rolling mills ahead of schedule. They proposed to reduce the assembly time for each frame from 800 hours to 400 hours in February, ensuring that four frames would be assembled before the Spring Festival and eight by the end of February.

    Workshop One is located to the left of the director's office. Before November of last year, this newly built, enormous workshop was empty, resembling a "wind and rain playground." However, in just over a month before the end of the year, the working masses miraculously created over sixty indigenous machine tools and produced two sets of rolling mills. When we arrived at this workshop, the workers were operating with every second counting. The efficiency of the indigenous machine tools had already been improved. The giant rolling mill frames, with their most numerous and complex processing surfaces, were being processed on a flow line of indigenous machine tools with fourteen processes. Amidst the screeching of metal cutting and the rumbling of cranes, we loudly asked the experienced masters operating the machines how long it took to process a single frame. He held up two fingers and shouted "Two days," which greatly surprised us. However, the worker comrades were not satisfied with this speed. They wanted to basically complete seven sets of rolling mills, capable of producing one million tons of steel annually, in February, with all of them leaving the factory by early March. In addition, they wanted to fill the entire workshop with indigenous machine tools to manufacture even larger 630mm billet mills and 1200mm large-scale sheet mills.

    To accomplish such a large task, in addition to the production workers, the workers in the tool workshop shouldered the arduous task of manufacturing indigenous machine tools and improving equipment utilization. The working masses in this workshop had already come up with a solution. Originally, many machine tools were distributed irrationally, and moving large workpieces back and forth wasted a lot of work hours. They decided to use the Spring Festival holiday to adjust them. After the Spring Festival, the machine tool workers could greatly improve work efficiency during operation. The members of the Old Huang Zhong Assault Team and the Huang Jiguang Assault Team took the lead in signing up for the machine tool disassembly and assembly work. In an instant, all the workers who were not returning home for the Spring Festival signed up. Fitter Qiu Xingfa, who had already bought a train ticket to return home, also canceled it.

      Workshop Mechanization
      Production Doubles

    On February 2nd, the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant held a grand mass rally. Under the slogan "Increase Production This Year Without Increasing Personnel, Double Production," proposed by the Party Committee, guarantee letters, letters of determination, and challenge letters poured onto the stage like snowflakes. A massive technological revolution movement to promote automation and mechanization was launched throughout the plant.

    The workers in the First Rolling Mill Workshop, which had become famous throughout the city last year for breaking down conservative and outdated operating procedures, continued to break superstitions and boldly innovate. An important creation—an automated plate shear combining indigenous and foreign methods—has begun testing. Originally, if steel bars ran out of the groove, they could not be controlled and would run freely, which was both wasteful and unsafe. Workers called it the "tiger's mouth." Sometimes, steel bars would accumulate in the rolling mill, increasing repair time. With this automated plate shear, as soon as a steel bar is found to be derailed, the button can be pressed to cut it off in time and continue production. This workshop also proposed: On the first day back to work after the Spring Festival, they will write two thousand big-character posters with rationalization proposals.

    The Metal Products Workshop, aiming to double the production of steel wire ropes and increase labor productivity by one time, has taken action after challenging the fraternal workshops. In the hand-cranked steel wire rope section of this workshop, workers originally pulled two steel wires with each hand every day, and they had to tie two more to their waists, like a "weighted race," walking back and forth in the 250-meter-long workshop for a distance of thirty miles. Now, motors have been installed to tow the steel wire ropes, and workers no longer have to "race" back and forth every day, out of breath, and there will no longer be any back pain. The last two machines are currently being installed. It is estimated that after this measure is implemented, output can be increased by two times, and labor can be saved by about one-half.

      Currently, cadres at all levels throughout the plant are using forms such as "Spring Festival New Year's Visits," "Cheerleading Squads," and comfort teams, based on last year's experience and adhering to the principle of not affecting workers' enjoyment of the festival, to research new technological reform topics targeting the key aspects of production in each workshop, and actively brewing activities to offer suggestions and gifts.

        Marching Towards New Targets

    Just stepping into February, the daily output of the Shanghai Watch Factory, the largest watch factory in the country, doubled. The factory produced 150 watches in one day. It produced 303 watches in three days. When discussing the production plan for February, the workers broke through the task of producing 7,230 watches this month assigned by the leadership and proposed a new target: 9,000 watches.

    The reporter walked into the factory. Whether in the workshop or the canteen, the corridor or the office, there were colorful challenge letters, response letters, and letters of determination everywhere, as well as competition areas and red flag rankings. On these battle reports and competition platforms, the workers proposed hundreds of technical measures—to mechanize manual operations.

    Entering the workshop, there was no ear-splitting roar of motors like in a machine factory. On a long row of desks, there were stamping machines, milling machines, drilling machines, planers, and lathes, each only the size of a radio, spinning at high speed. In one corner of the workshop, there was an indigenously made milling machine that had just been trial-produced. This was the result of workers and technicians breaking the superstition about manufacturing precision machine tools and making a technological revolution in the absence of data. The tolerance of the parts processed by this indigenous milling machine, which is only one foot square and composed of hundreds of parts, even reaches a few tenths of a hair's breadth. This month, eight indigenous milling machines will be put into production, basically solving the key problem of insufficient gear processing equipment. In another corner of the workshop, lathe operators wearing magnifying glasses that can magnify the workpieces several times are using lathe tools the size of matchsticks to process parts as thin as two strands of hair, cutting with undivided attention. People feel that this processing method cannot meet the needs of the doubling production. Workers say: Large machines can use multi-tool cutting operations, and small machines can also use them. They are studying the use of this advanced operating method, which can greatly increase production.

    Dozens of meters away from the final processing step of the entire factory—the assembly workshop—the reporter took off his dust-covered leather shoes and walked into the bright, dust-free assembly workshop. Rows of tables, assembly lines, workers' hands constantly using pliers to assemble tiny parts into shape step by step. In such a quiet environment, a second-by-second battle is also taking place. To speed up the assembly, worker Li Jiabin and his companions are manufacturing a watch case cleaning machine to replace manual cleaning of watch cases with mechanization, which can increase production efficiency by two times.

    For the Shanghai Watch Factory, February is just the beginning of a greater leap forward. All the workers in the factory have proposed that this year's output should be thirteen and a half times more than last year's.

      Dockworkers Skillfully Tackle Loading and Unloading Challenges

    The docks on both sides of the Huangpu River in Shanghai are particularly busy before the festival. After unloading the goods to supply residents for the festival, the dockworkers are busy loading and unloading coal, cotton, and pig iron. They have to prepare sufficient raw materials for the production of thousands of factories in Shanghai after the festival.

    More than 10,000 dockworkers will continue to stay on duty before the festival, undertaking the loading and unloading of cargo ships coming and going from the river and the sea, and summarizing last year's work and making a technological revolution during the gaps in their busy schedules. On the docks, workers' self-made trailers and automatic transporters are running around carrying goods. On cargo ships, workers' created flat-bottoming tools are constantly rolling to flatten the grain for transshipment to other places. Dockworkers reaped a great harvest in last year's technological revolution, and now they are sounding the war drums and advancing victoriously on this front.

    "Fiercely attack the technical barrier" and "Make a big revolution in technology" are written on the newly pasted red paper of determination by the dockworkers, which are dazzling. After research, the workers of the Forty-Eighth Group in the Fifth District decided to find time during the festival to discuss the key issues of improving the loading and unloading efficiency of the group, and propose projects to reform tools and improve operating skills this year, and study and solve them one by one in the future. Wu Lianhuai, an experienced worker who created seven types of loading and unloading tools in last year's technological revolution movement, has developed a new creation—an iron grab bucket for loading and unloading daily necessities. This grab bucket can load and unload three tons of daily necessities at a time, which is twice as efficient as the net bag traditionally used by the dock. Wu Lianhuai's new tool has aroused the interest of many workers. However, he believes that the model of the first new tool does not rotate flexibly enough, and he plans to ponder it himself during the Spring Festival, discuss it with others more, and make it more perfect.

    Make the Festival More
    Enjoyable and Meaningful

    This Spring Festival, most workers in Shanghai will take a vacation, except for a very small number who will stay on their production posts. However, whether they are preparing to return home to visit relatives or spend the festival in Shanghai, they are all thinking about production and making arrangements for a greater leap forward in production after the festival.

    Li Fuxiang, a drilling machine worker at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, plans to go home to his hometown of Changzhou to spend the Spring Festival this year. Although he is going back to see his children whom he has not seen for two years, his usual inseparable companions—the factory and the machines—will also accompany him back home.

    This young man, who has been rated as an advanced producer in Shanghai for three consecutive years, set a more leap-forward plan at the beginning of 1959: to complete five years' worth of work in one year. In the past first month, Li Fuxiang had already fought a beautiful battle in the technical innovation movement, completing 280 work hours of production tasks in 208 work hours. February is the shortest month of the year, but the red line of his production target in his mind continues to rise, striving to complete 320 work hours of tasks. A few days before the festival, Li Fuxiang worked hard and skillfully, and has already improved two tools in the drilling and tapping of the tube sheet of boiler cold and hot exchangers, increasing production efficiency by one time and seven times respectively. This time when he returns home, he plans to bring some drawings, materials, and technical books, and take the opportunity to study them, planning to work hard after returning to work.

    On January 19th, a short message publicly soliciting voluntary labor during the Spring Festival appeared in the Liberation Daily. The letter said: "The Spring Festival is coming soon. Large and small steel plants will take a holiday to celebrate the Spring Festival. If there is a need to repair steelmaking furnaces, I am willing to volunteer to work. I have a monthly pass. No matter how far or near the road is, day or night, I will be available whenever I am called. I am a boiler sample worker and also know welding, gas cutting, and other technologies." The letter was written by Tang Yuqing, a worker at the China Shipbuilding Factory. Tang Yuqing deeply felt that this year the country's various constructions need more steel, and steel plants will also have a greater leap forward after the Spring Festival. Therefore, he decided to go to help inspect and repair steelmaking furnaces during the festival. After sending the letter, he actively prepared. He did not book tickets for Spring Festival performances and also told his children that his wife and sister would accompany them to play during the festival, while he prepared his tools and waited for notification in the factory.

    Tang Yuqing's letter was widely responded to and supported by people. Workers, technicians, and teachers and students from other factories and schools wrote and called him, expressing their desire to learn from him, and some even asked to join him in this meaningful voluntary labor. Li Miaogen and Zhu Guanglin, experienced masters in the same workshop as Tang Yuqing, considered that his skills were not skilled enough and took the initiative to tell him: "If you can't handle it, look for us. Bring back complex drawings to study together."

    战鼓迎春
    本报驻上海记者
    1959年更大更好更全面的跃进战鼓，响遍了整个上海。全市一百二十万产业工人，在1月份生产上出色地打响新年的第一炮后，正在向更高的目标前进。他们决心要在2月份这个生产日最少的月度内，创造出丰功伟绩。在春节临近的时候，新的干劲、新的挑战、新的创造、新的成就……有如雨后春笋，争妍的鲜花。
        比智能赶制轧钢机
    在精业机器厂的厂长室里，我们刚刚开始访问，一阵锣鼓声从楼下敲了上来。党总支副书记花扬同志连忙迎了出去。原来是一车间装配中队的全体职工送来了大喜报。这个中队已经提前完成装配三台轧钢机机架的任务。他们提出，2月份要把每台机架装配工时由八百小时压缩到四百小时，春节前保证装好四台，2月底完成八台。
    一车间就在厂长室左边。去年11月份以前，这个新建的巨大车间还像个“风雨操场”空无所有。但在年底前一个多月内，工人群众神话般地造出六十多台土机床，生产出两套轧钢机。当我们走到这个车间，工人们正分秒必争地操作着。土机床的工作效率已经又提高了。加工面最多最复杂的巨型轧钢机机架，是由十四道工序的土机床流水作业线上加工的。我们在金属切削的尖叫声和行车的隆隆声中大声问操作着的老师傅，加工一只机架多少时间。他伸出两个指头喊着“两天”，我们大为惊奇。但工人同志们并不满足这个速度，他们要在2月份内基本上完成年产钢材一百万吨的七套轧钢机，3月上旬全部出厂。此外，还要把整个车间用土机床装满，制造更大的六百三十公厘开坯机和一千二百公厘大型薄板机。
    要完成这样大的任务，除了生产工人外，工具车间的工人们负担了制造土机床，提高设备利用率的艰巨任务。这个车间的工人群众已经想出办法，原来有不少机床分布不合理，加工大工作物搬来搬去浪费很多工时，他们决定用春节假期加以调整，春节过后，机床工人操作时就可以大大提高工作效率。老黄忠突击队和黄继光突击队的队员们首先带头报名参加拆装机床的工作，顷刻间，所有春节不回乡的工人都报了名，钳工仇兴发已买好回乡火车票，也退掉了。
      车间机械化
      生产成倍长
    2月2日，上钢二厂举行了轰轰烈烈的群众大会，在党委会提出的“今年增产不增人，生产翻一番”的口号下，各车间的保证书、决心书、挑战书雪片似的涌向主席台。一个大搞自动化、机械化的技术革命运动，在全厂展开了。
    去年曾经大破保守陈旧操作规程而闻名全市的第一轧钢车间，职工们继续破除迷信，大胆革新。一项重要的创造——土洋结合的三道车自动板剪已开始试验。原来，钢条跑出槽孔，就无法控制，任其自跑，既浪费又不安全，工人们称之为“老虎口”，有时钢条积在轧钢机内，增加检修时间。有了这种自动板剪，只要一发现钢条出轨，就可以按电钮及时切断，继续生产。这个车间还提出：春节后上班第一天，就要写出二千张合理化建议大字报。
    金属制品车间，以钢丝绳产量翻一番，劳动生产率提高一倍为目标，向兄弟车间挑战以后，已经行动起来。这个车间的手摇钢丝绳工段，原来工人们每天用双手各拉两根钢丝，腰里还要系上两根，像“负重赛跑”一样，在二百五十公尺长的车间里来回要走三十里路那样远的路程。现在这里已装起拖带钢丝绳的马达，工人再也不用上气不接下气的每天来回“赛跑”了，再也不会出现腰酸背痛的现象了。现在正安装最后二台，估计，这一项措施实现后，产量可以提高二倍，劳动力可以节约二分之一左右。
      目前，全厂各级干部正根据去年的经验，用“春节拜年会”、“拉拉队”、慰问队等形式，在不影响工人欢度佳节的原则下，针对各车间的生产关键，各自找对象研究新的技术改革课题，积极酝酿献计、献礼活动。
        向新的指标进军
    刚跨进2月，全国最大的手表厂——上海手表厂
  的日产量就翻了番。这个厂一日生产了一百五十只手表。三日就生产了三百零三只。职工们在讨论2月份生产计划时，冲破了领导布置的这个月生产七千二百三十只手表的任务，提出了新的指标：九千只。
    记者走进了工厂，无论在车间或食堂、走廊或办公室里，到处是彩色缤纷的挑战书、应战书和决心书，到处是竞赛园地和红旗榜。就在这些战报和比武台上，职工们提出了成百条技术措施——使手工操作机械化。
    进入车间，这里听不到像机器厂那样震耳欲聋的
  马达声，一长排的写字台上，安放着只有收音机般大小的冲床、铣床、钻床、刨床、车床……，在飞速地转动着。车间的一角，置放着刚试制成功的土铣床。这是工人和技术人员在破除了制造精密机床的迷信，缺乏资料的情况下，大闹技术革命的成果。这台仅有一尺见方、由几百个零件组成的土铣床，加工零件的公差，竟达到头发丝的几十分之一。这个月里，将有八台土铣床投入生产，基本上解决加工齿轮设备不足的关键。在车间的另一角，车工们戴上能够使工作物扩大几倍的放大镜，用像火柴杆般大小的车刀，加工像两根头发丝样粗细的零件，全神贯注地进行切削。人们感到采用这种加工方法，还不能满足生产成倍增长的需要。工人说：大机器可以用多刀切削的操作法，小机床上也同样能够使用。他们研究采用这种先进操作法，可以使产量大大提高。
    距离全厂最后一道加工工序——装配车间还有几十公尺的时候，记者脱下了染满尘土的皮鞋，走进了桌几明亮，微尘不染的装配车间。一排排的桌子，一条条流水作业线，工人们双手不停地用钳子，把微小的零件，一道道装配成型。就在这样的安静环境里，分秒必争的战斗也在进行着。为了加快装配速度，工人李嘉斌和他的同伴正在制造一种表壳清洗机，用机械化代替手工清洗表壳，生产效率可以提高二倍。
    2月份，上海手表厂还只是更大跃进的开始。全厂职工已经提出，今年产量要比去年增加十三倍半。
      码头工人巧攻装卸关
    上海港黄浦江两岸的码头上，节日前分外忙碌。供应居民过节的物资刚刚卸下，码头工人又在紧张装卸煤炭、棉花和生铁，他们得为上海千百家工厂节后生产准备充足的原材料。
    一万多名码头工人节前将继续留在岗位上，一面担负穿梭往来的江海货轮的装卸，一面利用繁忙中的间隙，总结去年工作，大闹技术革命。码头上，工人们自制的拖车和自动搬运车，正在载货奔驰。货船上，工人创造的平舱工具不断卷动，铺平转运外地的粮食。码头工人在去年的技术革命中获得丰收，现在他们又敲响战鼓，向这条战线乘胜进军。
    “猛攻技术关”、“大闹技术革命”，码头工人新贴的大红纸写的决心书，耀人眼目。五区第四十八组的工人经过研究，决定在节期找时间讨论提高小组装卸效率的关键问题，提出今年改革工具和提高操作技术的项目，在以后逐项研究解决。在去年的技术革命运动中，曾经创造七种装卸工具的老工人吴连怀，又研究出一种新创造——装卸日用百货的铁抓斗。这种抓斗一次能装卸三吨日用百货，比码头历来使用的网兜，效率要高一倍。吴连怀的新工具，引起了许多工人的兴趣。但他认为第一个新工具的模型转动还不够灵活，准备在春节期内自己琢磨琢磨，和别人多商量，把它搞得更完善。
    让节日过得更
    愉快更有意义
    今年春节，上海工人中除了极少数留在生产岗位上以外，大部分都将休假。但是，无论是准备回乡探亲的或是在上海过节的，他们都念念不忘生产，为节后生产更大的跃进作着安排。
    上海锅炉厂的钻床工人李福祥今年准备回家乡常州去过春节。虽然他回去是想看看已经两年不见的孩子，但是，工厂、机器这些平时形影不离的伙伴也将相随他一起回乡。
    这个曾经连续三年被评为上海市先进生产者的年青人，在1959年一开始，就立下了更跃进的规划：要在今年一年内完成五年的工作量。在刚过去的头一个月，李福祥已经在技术革新运动中打了个漂亮仗，用二百零八个工时完成了二百八十个工时的生产任务。2月是全年最短的一个月，但是他脑子里那条生产指标的红线继续上升，争取完成三百二十个工时的任务。节前几天，李福祥苦干、巧干，已经在锅炉冷热器管板钻孔和攻螺纹方面改进了两项工具，使生产效率分别提高一倍和七倍。这次回乡，他准备带些图纸、资料和技术书籍，顺便钻研钻研，打算上班后大干一场。
    1月19日，解放日报上出现了一封公开征求春节义务劳动的短信，信上说：“春节快到了，大小炼钢厂都要休假，欢度春节，如有需要修理炼钢炉等，我愿意去义务劳动。我有月季票，不论路远路近，白天黑夜，随叫随到。我是锅炉出样工，也会电焊、气割等技术。”写信的是中华造船厂工人唐余庆。唐余庆深深感到今年祖国各项建设需要更多的钢铁，钢铁厂在春节后，也将有更大的跃进。因此，他决定节日里去帮助检修炼钢炉。发信以后，他就积极进行准备。春节的戏票不订了，还和孩子们讲好，节日让他爱人和妹妹陪他们玩，自己准备好工具在厂里等候通知。
    唐余庆的信发表以后，受到人们普遍响应和支持。别的工厂的工人、技术人员和学校的师生纷纷写信和打电话给他，表示向他学习，有的还要求同他一起参加这个有意义的义务劳动。和唐余庆同车间的老师傅李妙根和祝广林考虑到他的技术还不够熟练，主动关照他说：“你搞不下来时就找我们，复杂图纸就带回来一起研究。”
