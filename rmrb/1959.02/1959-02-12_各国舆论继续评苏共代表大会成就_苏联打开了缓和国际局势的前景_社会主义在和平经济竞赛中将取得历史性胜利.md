Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Communist Party newspapers in Japan, Italy, and Belgium, as well as social commentary in countries such as Finland, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Argentina, and Uruguay, have successively published comments on the closing of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Japan's "Akahata" expressed its belief when talking about the results of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that the socialist system is bound to win in the competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system.

    "Akahata" said that guaranteeing this victory are: the brilliant achievements of Soviet science and technology, the undeniable superiority of socialist countries in terms of political and economic systems, the selfless labor of the Soviet people, and their determination to over fulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan.

    The newspaper emphasized that the argument of some bourgeois propaganda organizations that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a "threat to the free world" is not worth refuting, because the essence of this plan is to increase the welfare of the Soviet people on the basis of carrying out peaceful construction.

    "Akahata" said that the Soviet Union is committed to peace and calls for peaceful competition, but this by no means indicates that the Soviet Union is weak. The newspaper said that Western imperialism faces two paths: one is the path of war, which is the path of suicide, and the other is the path of recognizing the principle of peaceful coexistence. There is no other road.

    The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" published consecutive commentaries on this matter on the 7th and 8th. The commentary pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU marked a new stage for the Soviet Union. The commentary said that this congress developed and deepened all the arguments touched upon at the 20th Congress. It has gone beyond the scope of events that are only meaningful to the Soviet Union. To understand the full international significance of this congress, it is enough to mention just one point—the task of catching up with the United States in the economic field. "Unità" also discussed in detail the prospects opened up by the congress in easing international tensions.

    The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Le Drapeau Rouge" published a commentary on the 9th written by the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Pierre Joye. The article said: "The reports and speeches at the 21st Congress of the CPSU clearly proved that the line established by the 20th Party Congress was correct. The vibrant ideas of this congress make it possible for the Soviet Union to advance at a rapid pace along the road to communism."

    The article pointed out that the argument of the 20th Congress of the CPSU that war is not inevitable has proven to be correct. The tremendous achievements the Soviet Union has made on the road to prosperity are in themselves a major support for the struggle of working people around the world for their rights and socialism.

    The Finnish People's Democratic League's newspaper "Kansan Uutiset" said in its commentary on the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU that completing the economic tasks put forward in the resolutions means a historic victory for socialism in its peaceful competition with capitalism, which is a victory of great significance on a global scale. Despite the fact that capitalist countries have production conditions and a high level of technology, the capitalist system itself makes it impossible for it to fully utilize its potential and cannot answer the Soviet Union's economic competition with increasingly higher production figures. The newspaper went on to say that the increasingly serious economic crisis, long-term unemployment, and declining output of capitalism make it clear to everyone that the capitalist system cannot win this competition. "Kansan Uutiset" pointed out that if an armed invasion were launched against the socialist camp, it would mean the end of capitalism.

    Burma's "Botahtaung" published an editorial saying that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, adopted at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, is a plan for building a communist society and a plan for world peace. The newspaper expressed its belief that this Soviet plan will definitely be realized. Its successful implementation will inevitably attract the attention of underdeveloped countries.

    "Cambodia News" published an editorial saying that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a "decisive step" in the competition between the socialist and capitalist systems. The Soviet Union's purpose in participating in this competition is not to eliminate mankind, but on the contrary, to eliminate hunger and poverty.

    Social commentary in Ceylon also believes that the 21st Congress of the CPSU is an event of great international significance. Political and business figures in Ceylon pointed out in talks with TASS reporters that the Soviet Union's grand plan for the development of the national economy will promote the economic development of economically underdeveloped Asian and African countries by expanding trade and economic ties between the Soviet Union and these countries.

    Ceylon Member of Parliament S.D. Bandaranaike said: "Economic cooperation and trade between Ceylon and the Soviet Union will better establish friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries. Developing trade with the world socialist market will free us from dependence on the imperialist market."

    All the morning newspapers in the Argentine capital published Khrushchev's concluding speech at the closing meeting of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the 6th. The newspapers emphasized that Khrushchev demanded that Western countries stop the "Cold War" in his concluding speech. Many newspapers pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU, held under the banner of struggling for the consolidation of peace, believes that war can be avoided.

    All the newspapers in Uruguay on the 6th published articles and news about the 21st Congress of the CPSU and Khrushchev's concluding speech. These newspapers emphasized that the congress fully agreed with the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan and the general line of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    "El Popular" believes that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is the "decisive stage in building the material and technical basis of communism" and emphasizes that the Seven-Year Plan will play an outstanding role in the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    各国舆论继续评苏共代表大会成就
    苏联打开了缓和国际局势的前景
    社会主义在和平经济竞赛中将取得历史性胜利
    新华社10日讯　日本、意大利、比利时共产党机关报和芬兰、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、阿根廷、乌拉圭等国的社会舆论，纷纷就苏共第二十一次代表大会闭幕发表评论。
    日本“赤旗报”在谈到苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的结果时表示相信，在社会主义制度同资本主义制度的竞赛中，社会主义制度必将取得胜利。
    “赤旗报”说，保证这一胜利的是：苏联科学技术的光辉成就、社会主义国家在政治和经济制度方面的无可辩驳的优越性、苏联人民的忘我劳动和超额完成七年计划任务的决心。
    报纸强调指出，某些资产阶级宣传机构所说苏联七年计划是“对自由世界的威胁”的论调是不值一驳的，因为这个计划的实质是在开展和平建设的基础上增进苏联人民的福利。
    “赤旗报”说，苏联致力于和平，它号召进行和平竞赛，但这绝不表明苏联软弱。报纸说，西方帝国主义面前摆着两条道路：一条是战争的道路，也就是自杀的道路，另一条是承认和平共处的原则的道路。其他的道路是没有的。
    意大利共产党机关报“团结报”7日、8日连续就这件事发表了评论。评论指出：苏共第二十一次代表大会标志着苏联进入一个新的阶段。评论说，这次代表大会发展和深化了第二十次代表大会上所触及的一切论点。它已超越只有对苏联具有意义的事件的范围。要理解这次代表大会的全部国际意义，只要提一提其中的一点——在经济方面赶上美国的任务——就够了。“团结报”还详细论述了代表大会在缓和国际紧张局势方面所打开的前景。
    比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”9日发表了这家报纸总编辑皮埃尔·儒瓦写的一篇评论文章。文章说：“苏共第二十一次代表大会上的报告和发言清楚地证明了第二十次党代表大会所制定的路线是正确的。这次代表大会生气勃勃的思想使苏联有可能以飞快的速度沿着通往共产主义的道路前进。”
    文章指出，事实证明苏共第二十次代表大会关于战争不是不可以避免的论点是正确的。苏联在通向繁荣的道路上所获得的巨大成就本身就是对全世界劳动人民争取自己的权利和社会主义斗争的重大支持。
    芬兰人民民主联盟的机关报“人民新闻”在评论苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议时说，完成决议中所提出的经济任务意味着社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛中的历史性胜利，这是世界范围内的具有重大意义的胜利。尽管资本主义国家有生产条件和很高的技术水平，但是资本主义制度本身使它不能充分利用它的潜力，不能用愈来愈高的生产数字来答复苏联的经济竞赛。报纸接着说，资本主义愈来愈严重的经济危机、长期的失业和产量的下降，使得每个人都可以看出，资本主义制度是不可能在这种竞赛中取胜的。“人民新闻”指出，万一对社会主义阵营发动武装侵略的话，那就意味着资本主义的结束。
    缅甸“博塔东日报”发表社论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会上所通过的苏联发展国民经济七年计划是建设共产主义社会的计划，是世界和平的计划。报纸表示相信，苏联的这个计划一定能够实现。
    它的胜利实现必将吸引不发达国家的注意。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”发表社论说，苏联的七年计划是社会主义和资本主义两种制度的竞赛中一个“决定性的步骤”。苏联参加这种竞赛的目的不是为了消灭人类，而恰恰相反，是为了消灭饥饿和贫穷。
  锡兰的社会舆论也认为苏联第二十一次代表大会是具有巨大国际意义的事件。锡兰的政界和实业界人士在和塔斯社记者谈话中指出，苏联发展国民经济的宏伟计划将以扩大苏联同经济不发达的亚非国家之间的贸易和经济联系的方法来促进这些国家的经济发展。
    锡兰议会议员塞·迪·班达拉奈克说：“锡兰和苏联的经济合作和贸易将使我们两国之间的友谊和相互了解更好地建立起来。和世界社会主义市场发展贸易将使我们摆脱对帝国主义市场的依赖。”
    阿根廷首都所有的晨报6日都刊登了赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会闭幕会议上的总结发言。各报强调指出，赫鲁晓夫在总结发言中要求西方国家停止“冷战”。许多报纸指出，在为巩固和平而斗争的旗帜下举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会相信战争是可能避免的。
    乌拉圭所有的报纸6日都刊载了关于苏共第二十一次代表大会的文章和消息以及赫鲁晓夫的总结发言。这些报纸都强调指出，代表大会完全同意七年计划控制数字和苏联共产党中央委员会的总路线。
    “人民报”认为苏联七年计划是“建设共产主义物质技术基础的决定性阶段”，并强调指出，七年计划将在维护世界和平的事业中起卓越的作用。
