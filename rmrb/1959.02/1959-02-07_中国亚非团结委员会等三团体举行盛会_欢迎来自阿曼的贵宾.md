Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: The China-Asia Africa Solidarity Committee, the China Islamic Association, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a grand gathering this morning at the CPPCC Auditorium to warmly welcome Prince Harsai, the Deputy Imam of Oman, and his entourage.

At 9:10 AM, the distinguished Omani guests, accompanied by Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the China-Asia Africa Solidarity Committee and Director of the China Islamic Association, Da Puson, Zhang Jie, Vice Directors of the China Islamic Association, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Le Songsheng, Vice Mayor of Beijing, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, more than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital, who attended the meeting, warmly applauded to welcome the distinguished guests. Ragheb, the Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to China, was also invited to attend the welcoming meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Da Puson, Vice Director of the China Islamic Association. Bao Erhan and Harsai delivered speeches at the meeting respectively. In his speech, Bao Erhan emphasized that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people, and deeply believe that the final victory will definitely belong to the Omani people who fight to the end for national independence and freedom. In his speech, Harsai pointed out that the struggle of the Omani people is not isolated, and that the Omani people, inspired by the Arab national liberation movement and the Bandung Principles, will persist in fighting against the colonialists.

In his speech on behalf of the three organizations, Bao Erhan warmly welcomed the distinguished guests. He said that the heroic Omani people, under extremely difficult conditions, facing the British invading army armed with modern weapons, have carried out a heroic and tenacious struggle, winning the sympathy and admiration of peace-loving people all over the world.

Bao Erhan said that our people have always had deep sympathy for the movement of the Arab countries' people to strive for national independence. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Omani people and severely condemn the shameless crimes of the imperialists' aggression against Oman and their barbaric massacre of the Omani people. We resolutely demand that the imperialists immediately stop the aggression in Oman and demand the immediate withdrawal of the imperialist aggressor troops.
In his speech, Harsai said: The unhealthy minds of the imperialists have always dreamed of controlling our country's resources and driving our people to serve their aggressive purposes in order to create even greater crimes. However, our heroic people stand firm in the storm and resolutely and forcefully fight back against the colonialists.

Harsai pointed out: People say that a friend in need is a friend indeed. If this is the case, our people, like the people of other Arab countries, believe that the great Chinese people are loyal friends in defending the great cause of national independence and national liberation.

The speeches of Bao Erhan and Harsai were warmly welcomed. At the end of Harsai's speech, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly, thanking him for his friendly speech. When Harsai returned to his seat, Bao Erhan embraced him warmly, and thunderous applause resounded again in the venue, wishing the Omani people the final victory in their struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Prince Harsai, the Deputy Imam of Oman, returned to Beijing on the midnight of the 5th after visiting Wuhan.

    中国亚非团结委员会等三团体举行盛会
    欢迎来自阿曼的贵宾
    据新华社6日讯　中国亚非团结委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会和中国人民对外文化协会，今天上午在政协礼堂举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王和他的随行人员。
    上午九时十分，阿曼贵宾由中国亚非团结委员会副主席、中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生、张杰，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南，北京市副市长乐松生等陪同登上主席台。这时，参加大会的一千多名首都各界群众，热烈鼓掌欢迎贵宾。阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使拉加卜也应邀出席了欢迎大会。
    大会由中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生主持，包尔汉和哈尔塞先后在会上讲了话。包尔汉在讲话中强调指出，中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，并深信最后胜利一定属于为民族独立和自由而斗争到底的阿曼人民。哈尔塞在讲话中指出，阿曼人民的斗争不是孤立的，阿曼人民在阿拉伯民族解放运动和万隆原则的鼓舞下将坚持对殖民主义者进行斗争。
    包尔汉在代表三团体的讲话中热烈欢迎贵宾们。他说，英勇的阿曼人民在极端艰苦的条件下，面临掌握着近代化武器的英国侵略军，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，赢得了全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和敬佩。
    包尔汉说，我国人民一向对阿拉伯各国人民为争取民族独立的运动寄予深厚的同情。中国人民坚决支持阿曼人民的正义斗争，严厉地谴责帝国主义者侵略阿曼和对阿曼人民进行野蛮屠杀的无耻罪行。我们坚决要求帝国主义者立即停止在阿曼所进行的侵略，要求立即撤退帝国主义侵略军。哈尔塞在讲话中说：帝国主义者不健康的脑袋一贯梦想控制我国的资源，驱使我国人民为他们的侵略目的效劳，以制造更大的罪行。然而，我们英勇的人民屹立在暴风雨中，全力而坚决地回击殖民主义者。
    哈尔塞指出：人们说，患难中可以看出谁是朋友，如果是这样的话，我国人民也和其它阿拉伯国家的人民一样，认为伟大的中国人民是捍卫民族独立与民族解放的伟大事业的忠实朋友。
    包尔汉和哈尔塞的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。在哈尔塞讲话结束时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌，感谢他所作的充满友谊的讲话。当哈尔塞回到席位上时，包尔汉同他热情拥抱在一起，这时会场上再一次响起了春雷般的掌声，祝阿曼人民取得斗争的最后胜利。
