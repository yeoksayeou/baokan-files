Continuing to Develop the Successful Experience of Organizing the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture Last Year
Shantou Prefecture Vigorously Develops High-Yield Experimental Fields
A Large Number of Cadres in Chao'an County are Sent to the Grassroots, and the Enthusiasm of the Masses is Even Greater, with a Booming Competition
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Guangzhou on February 26th) Guangdong Province's Shantou Prefecture, holding high the red flag of last year's great harvest experience, has launched a vigorous mass movement of millions of mu of high-yield experimental fields throughout the entire prefecture, driving the entire peasant masses and the entire early rice production, to ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in this year's early rice production.
	The large-scale high-yield experimental field movement in Shantou Prefecture this year requires a focus on grain, while simultaneously grasping agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. The scale of the prefecture's high-yield experimental fields is extremely large. Currently, the experimental fields for grain crops have reached more than 1.21 million mu, accounting for about 24% of the early rice planting area. Hundreds of thousands of cadres from party committees at all levels, various departments, production management areas of communes, production teams, as well as youth, women, and militia, have participated in the experimental field movement, achieving experimentation at all levels, everyone participating, and the combination of cadres, masses, and technicians, forming a professional team. The secretary and members of the prefectural committee in charge of agriculture also plant experimental fields with commune members or cadres and workers of farms.
	The counties of Jieyang, Chaoyang, Puning, and Chao'an, where the large-scale experimental field movement has been carried out more quickly, have now generally completed the work of determining leaders, mu numbers, plans, measures, and personnel numbers. The preparatory work for the experimental fields in these counties has been largely completed in some areas, and is being accelerated in others. More than 890 cadres from the Nanyangshan Commune in Puning County have accumulated more than 6.5 million dan of fertilizer for more than 1,700 mu of experimental fields, averaging more than 3,000 dan per mu. The experimental fields in Chaoyang County have averaged 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, and deep plowing has generally been done to a depth of one to two chi. In Puning County, the shallowest deep plowing of the experimental fields reached 1.2 chi, the deepest was more than 3 chi, and the average was about 1.5 chi. Many areas have completed the work of organizing irrigation and drainage systems and cultivated land, and the accumulated fertilizer is also being continuously transported to the fields. Some experimental fields have already sown seeds, and some seedlings have grown very lush.
	Chaoyang, Puning and other counties, while vigorously developing large-scale high-yield experimental fields, also pay special attention to grasping competition and comparison, and the method of combining points and areas, so that the situation of the experimental field high-yield movement is always kept hot. Chaoyang County has divided the entire county into five competition zones, with five major comparisons throughout the season. The content of the comparisons focuses on preparatory work, spring plowing production, and field management, and the details of the comparison content have been established. Puning County has now established dozens of professional teams for experimental fields with the participation of more than 48,000 people. Under the leadership of the professional teams, more than 200,000 people have invested in accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, cultivating strong seedlings, and managing fields for the experimental fields. This has formed a high-yield experimental field network throughout the county. Each commune has a central experimental field, and each management area has a high-yield experimental area, so that the point and area breathe together, and the point leads the area, so that the flowers of the "Eight-Character Charter" bloom directly in the fields, driving the entire large-scale high-yield movement.
	(Our newspaper's dispatch from Guangzhou on February 26th) China's first thousand-jin county of rice in 1957 – Chao'an County in Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province – has formed a magnificent mass movement to vigorously develop large-scale high-yield experimental fields for early rice production.
	The people who have signed up to participate in the large-scale high-yield experimental fields in Chao'an County include tens of thousands of cadres such as the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, members of the Party Committee of each People's Commune, Directors of Management Areas, Production Team Leaders, and Production Group Leaders; it also includes tens of thousands of people from all walks of life such as old peasants, youth, militia, women, and students. The county has already determined that there are 88,510 mu of high-yield experimental fields, accounting for more than 20% of the early rice planting area. Each commune has generally carried out the work of determining leaders, determining plots, determining personnel, determining targets, and determining measures. Each commune has generally carried out high-yield experimental competitions between management areas and management areas, and between production teams and production teams. The general competition slogan of the Anbu Commune, in addition to the 48 production teams that have all been linked to the competition, also carried out competitions between individuals in the production teams. The general competition slogan is: "See who is more energetic, see who has more advanced indicators, more measures, see who starts earlier, see who manages better, see who has higher yields." They are determined to turn every high-yield experimental field into a red flag of production. The entire rural political atmosphere appears very lively.
	Each commune in the county vigorously develops high-yield experimental fields, not only with advanced indicators, but also with a set of agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" measures that are stricter than the standards of general fields. For example, in terms of deep plowing and soil improvement, in addition to deep plowing 5 to 1 chi deeper than general fields, more than 10,000 mu have also been combined with the leveling of cultivated land, the construction of farmland water conservancy, and the planning of roads, reaching the standard of gardenization. In terms of varieties: in addition to continuing to promote the original good varieties such as "Plaza No. 13" and "No. 60 Dwarf Nant," the high-yield experimental fields have also introduced excellent varieties such as "Luyu Xinzhu No. 8" and "Nonglin No. 16 Dwarf Sticky." Many high-yield experimental fields have also boldly proposed the slogan of realizing "ten thousand grains per jin." At present, the entire county is vigorously managing fields and delivering fertilizer. The high-yield experimental fields of Fengxi, Fengtang, Linxi and other communes that started earlier are starting to transplant seedlings.
	In the process of carrying out the large-scale high-yield experimental field movement, a large number of cadres were sent to the grassroots, giving great encouragement to the vast number of commune members. One-third of the cadres from the county-level leading organs were also sent down, including two county party secretaries, three members of the county party standing committee and eight ministers. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, when the commune members were still celebrating the Spring Festival, the entire county, led by the county party secretary, dispatched more than 10,000 cadres to deliver fertilizer to the experimental fields. After determining the location of their own experimental fields, the cadres of each commune immediately took action.
	With the vigorous development of the large-scale high-yield experimental field movement, 130,000 mu of fields have been managed in the county, accounting for 54% of the area that should be managed. The Tiepu Commune, which has made the fastest progress, has completed all the fields that should be managed. The entire county has soaked 80% of the seeds, sown 60% of the seeds, and the progress of fertilizer delivery has also been greatly accelerated.
	Taking the development of the large-scale high-yield experimental field movement as the key link to drive the entire commune members and the entire agricultural production is a successful experience of Chao'an County in organizing a great leap forward in agricultural production in the late rice season last year. The Chao'an County Party Committee particularly emphasized that this experience should be continued and developed this year. As early as when the autumn harvest began last year, the county party committee made arrangements; recently, in the vigorous development of the high-yield experimental field movement, all localities have unified understanding and unified action by posting big-character posters, holding various meetings, and organizing great debates, so that the enthusiasm of everyone can be brought into play.

    继续发展去年组织农业大跃进的成功经验
    汕头专区大搞高产试验田
    潮安县大批干部下放基层，群众干劲更足，竞赛热气腾腾
    本报广州26日电　广东省汕头专区高举去年大丰收经验红旗，在全专区范围内开展了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的百万亩高产试验田运动，带动全体农民群众和整个早造生产，保证今年早造生产更大更好更全面的跃进。
    汕头专区今年早造的大面积高产试验田运动，要求以粮食为主，农林牧副渔一齐抓。全区高产试验田的规模极大，目前，粮食作物的试验田已达到一百二十一万多亩，占早造种植面积24％左右。投入试验田运动的有各级党委、各部门、各公社生产管理区、生产队以及青年、妇女、民兵等干部共数十万人，做到层层试验，人人动手，干部、群众、技术人员三结合，组成专业队伍。地委管农业的书记和委员也分别和公社社员或农场的干部和工人一起种植试验田。
    大面积试验田运动开展得较快的揭阳、潮阳、普宁、潮安等县，现在一般都完成了定领导、定亩数、定规划、定措施、定人数的工作。这些县的试验田备耕工作有的已大体上完成，有的正在加速进行中。普宁县南阳山公社的八百九十多个干部已为一千七百多亩试验田积了六百五十多万担肥料，平均每亩达三千担以上。潮阳县的试验田平均每亩已积肥二千担，深翻一般都做到一尺到二尺深。普宁县的试验田深翻最浅的达一尺二寸，深的在三尺以上，一般的在一尺五寸左右。许多地区已经做好了整理排灌系统和耕地的工作，积集到的肥料也正在源源不断地运到田间。有的试验田已播下了种子，有的秧苗已长得十分葱绿。
    潮阳、普宁等县在大搞大面积丰产试验田运动中，还特别注意抓好竞赛评比和点面结合，以点带面的方法，使试验田丰产运动的局面自始至终保持热气腾腾。潮阳县已将全县划为五个竞赛区，全季分五次大评比，评比内容分别以备耕工作、春耕生产和田间管理为中心，并已订出评比内容的细节。普宁县全县目前已经成立了有四万八千多人参加的几十支试验田的专业队伍，在专业队带动下，有二十多万群众投入了为试验田积肥、制肥、送肥、培育壮秧和办田等工作。这就在全县范围形成了丰产试验田网，各公社都有中心试验田，各管理区有丰产试验片，使得点面气息相通，以点带面，做到“八字宪法”的鲜花直开田头，把大面积丰产运动整个带动起来。
    本报广州26日电　我国1957年第一个水稻千斤县——广东省汕头专区潮安县，大搞早造粮食生产大面积高产试验田已形成了规模壮阔的群众性运动。
    潮安县报名参加大面积高产试验田的人，包括中共县委第一书记、各人民公社党委委员、管理区主任、生产队长、生产组长等上万的干部；也包括几万老农、青年、民兵、妇女、学生等各阶层的群众。全县已经确定的高产试验田计有八万八千五百一十亩，占早造种植面积的20％多。各公社都普遍进行了定领导、定地段、定人员、定指标和定措施的工作。各个公社普遍开展了管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队之间的高产试验竞赛。庵埠公社除四十八个生产队已全部挂钩竞赛外，还在生产队里开展了个人与个人之间的竞赛，普遍的竞赛口号是：“看谁劲头大，看谁指标先进，措施多，看谁动手早，看谁管理好，看谁产量高。”他们决心把每一块高产试验田变成一面生产红旗。整个农村的政治气氛显得非常生动活泼。
    全县各公社大搞高产试验田，不仅指标先进，措施也是一套比一般田标准更严格的农业“八字宪法”，如深翻改土方面，高产试验田除比一般田深翻五寸至一尺外，还有一万多亩结合进行了平整耕地、兴修田间水利、规划道路等工作，达到了田园化的标准。在品种方面：高产试验田除了继续推广原有的“广场十三号”、“六十号矮脚南特”等良种外，还引进了“陆羽新竹八号”、“农林十六号矮仔粘”等优良品种。不少高产试验田还大胆提出实现“万粒斤”的口号。目前，全县都在大举办田、送肥。动手较早的枫溪、凤塘、磷溪等公社的高产试验田却在开始插秧了。
    在开展大面积高产试验田运动中，大批干部下放到基层，给广大社员很大鼓舞。县一级领导机关也下放了三分之一的干部，其中包括两个县委书记、三个县委常委和八个部长。旧历大年初二，当社员们还在欢度春节的时候，全县便由县委书记带头出动了一万多名干部送肥下试验田。各公社干部在确定了自己试验田地点后，都马上行动。
    随着大面积高产试验田运动的蓬勃开展，目前全县已办田十三万亩，占应办面积的54％。进度最快的铁铺公社应办的田，已经全部办完。全县已浸种80％，播种60％，送肥工作进度也大大加快。
    以开展大面积高产试验田运动为纲，把全体社员群众和整个农业生产带动起来，这是潮安县去年晚造组织农业生产大跃进的一条成功经验。中共潮安县委会特别强调要在今年继续运用并发展这条经验。早在去年开始秋收时，县委便作了部署；最近在大搞高产试验田运动中，各地都通过贴大字报，召开各种会议，组织大辩论，统一认识，统一行动，把每一个人的干劲都发挥出来。
