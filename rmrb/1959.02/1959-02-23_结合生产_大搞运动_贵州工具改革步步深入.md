Combining with Production, Launching a Large-Scale Movement
	Guizhou's Tool Reform Deepens Step by Step
(Our newspaper, Guiyang, February 22nd) Guizhou Province's tool reform movement, combined with production, persists throughout the year and deepens step by step. On the basis of creating, improving, and promoting 7.9 million various agricultural tools last year, this year has launched an even more vigorous mass movement.

According to statistics from fourteen counties and cities in Zunyi, Anshun, Qiannan, and the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture, more than 12,000 various tools for water conservancy construction, field management, and transportation were improved in January alone. These tools are of good quality, highly efficient, and very popular among the masses. At the Fengxiang Reservoir construction site in Songkan Commune, Tongzi County, a tool reform movement was carried out, and within five days, the construction site was mechanized, eliminating human carrying and shoulder pole labor. The bamboo slipways, wooden rail dump trucks, and funnel chutes for transporting soil manufactured at this construction site increased efficiency tenfold to twentyfold. In field management, Jinsha County has initially achieved self-flowing irrigation. Previously, 124 people were needed to manage 540 mu of wheat fields, but now only 60 people are required. During the wheat cultivation period, Xifeng County created a simple wooden wheat weeding harrow, which can increase efficiency fourfold.

At the end of January this year, after a new upsurge of manure accumulation movement was launched throughout the province, various places mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and plans to innovate manure accumulation and transportation tools. Guizhou is mountainous and the roads are narrow, and in the past, many people thought it was difficult to reform manure transportation tools, but now everywhere appears "flying in the sky, pushing on the ground" methods of transporting fertilizer. In the agricultural tool factories of various people's communes in Xingyi County, more than 5,000 people have been put into rush-making handcarts, rubber-wheeled carts, and other manure transportation tools. The Mubapa Commune in Suiyang County plans to increase from the current 710 animal-powered vehicles to 2,000, which can save 60,000 workdays. According to the situation of high mountains and insufficient labor in Yangtou People's Commune in Tongren County, fifteen aerial cableways have been erected, each of which can transport 70,000 jin of fertilizer a day, equivalent to the transportation volume of twenty people per day. The manure transportation vehicles, granular fertilizer manufacturing machines, land-based fertilizer application vehicles and other seventeen kinds of tools manufactured by the masses in Xiuwen County generally increased efficiency fivefold.

Currently, the spring plowing season has arrived. The leading departments of tool reform in Guizhou Province require all localities to grasp the formulation and revision of this year's tool reform plan, and arrange the work in stages according to the production season. At present, first grasp the production and repair of small agricultural tools, and call on blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons to return to their teams; establish and restore agricultural tool factories at all levels to process and rush-make and repair various agricultural tools centered on deep plowing, sowing, and transplanting; and adopt the method of holding on-site meetings regularly and mutual evaluation to actively promote improved tools that are "highly efficient, simple to manufacture, easy to operate, low in cost, sturdy and durable, and widely adaptable."

    结合生产  大搞运动
    贵州工具改革步步深入
    本报贵阳22日电　贵州省工具改革运动，结合生产，坚持全年，步步深入。在去年创造、改良、推广各种农具七百九十万件的基础上，今年又掀起声势浩大的群众运动。
    据遵义、安顺、黔南等地区和黔东南自治州的十四个县市统计，1月份共改良水利施工、田间管理和交通运输等各种工具一万二千多件。这些工具质量好、效率高，很受群众欢迎。桐梓县松坎公社枫香水库工地，开展改革工具运动，五天时间内就实现了工地机械化，消灭了人背肩挑现象。这个工地制造的竹滑丝、木轨斗车、漏斗滑槽等运土工具，提高工效十倍到二十倍。在田间管理中，金沙县初步实现了水利灌溉自流化，过去要一百二十四人管理的五百四十亩麦田，现在只要六十人就够了。息烽县在小麦中耕期间创制了简易木质薅麦耙，可提高工效四倍。
    今年1月底，全省掀起积肥运动新高潮后，各地纷纷发动群众献计献策，革新积肥运肥工具。贵州山高路窄，过去许多人认为很难改革运肥工具，但是现在到处出现“天上飞、地上推”的运肥方法。兴义县各人民公社的农具厂，已有五千多人投入赶制手推车、胶轮车等运肥工具。绥阳县募坝公社着手从目前的七百一十部人畜力车增加到二千部，这样可节约劳动日六万个。铜仁县漾头人民公社根据当地山高劳力不足的情况，架起了十五处高空滑丝，每处一天能运送肥料七万斤，相当二十人一天的运输量。修文县群众制造的运肥车、颗粒肥料制造机、陆行追肥车等十七种工具，一般都提高工效五倍。
    目前春耕季节已到，贵州省工具改革领导部门要求各地在抓紧制订和修改今年的工具改革规划时，根据生产季节分段安排工作。当前先抓小农具生产和修理，号召铁匠、木匠、石匠归队；建立和恢复各级农具厂，加工赶制和修配以深耕、播种、插秧为中心的各种农具；并采取定期召开现场会议，相互评比的办法，积极推广“工效高、制造简单、便于操作、成本低、坚固耐用、适应性广”的改良工具。
