The Birth of a Portable Oxygenator

　　A task was given to Gao Limin: to purchase several sets of oxygenator equipment as quickly as possible for patients in need.

　　Gao Limin, the pharmacy director of the Wuhan Commercial System Workers' Hospital, was a demobilized soldier. He seemed to accept the task assigned to him by his superiors as an order. Contrary to expectations, he was unable to purchase any after running around for a long time. What to do? This question kept swirling in his mind. Sometimes, he seemed to see with his own eyes the tragic scenes of patients suffering from oxygen deficiency; other times, he seemed to see with his own eyes how the condition of patients improved after receiving oxygen. He also thought of himself as a demobilized soldier and a member of the Communist Youth League, who had received strict education in the army and could not be indifferent to such a serious problem affecting patients' lives. He was determined to create a "portable oxygenator." In the process of creation, he encountered many difficulties and sometimes wavered. After the leadership learned about it, they encouraged and supported him. Through his hard work and research, he boldly used the principle of producing oxygen by contacting hydrogen peroxide with manganese dioxide, conducted experiments time after time, and finally created the "portable oxygenator." Comrade Gao Limin's creation has been praised and valued by the leadership. The "portable oxygenator" has now been sent to the Technical Innovation Exhibition Hall of the Central Ministry of Health and the Leap Forward Exhibition of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau for exhibition.　Wu Shangwen

    轻便输氧器的诞生
    一个任务交给了高立民，要他尽快购买几套氧器设备，以供病人需要。
    高立民，是武汉商业系统职工医院的药房主任，复员军人。他好像接受命令一样，要完成上级交给自己的任务。事情出乎意料之外，跑了好久，也没有买到。怎么办？他的脑子里一直在盘旋着这个问题。有时，他好像亲眼看到了缺氧病人的惨景；有时，又好像亲眼看到了由于输送了氧病情好转的情况。他也想到自己是个复员军人、共青团员，曾在部队里受过严格的教育，不能对这样严重影响病人生命的问题无动于衷。他，下定决心要创造一种“轻便输氧器”。在创造过程中碰到了许多困难，有时就动摇起来。领导上知道后，就鼓励他，支持他。在他的刻苦钻研下，大胆地用双氧水通过二氧化锰的接触制造氧气的原理，一次一次地进行了试验，终于创制成了“轻便输氧器”。高立民同志的这一创造，受到领导的表扬和重视。“轻便输氧器”现在已经送到中央卫生部技术革新展览馆和武汉市卫生局跃进展览会中展览。　吴商文
