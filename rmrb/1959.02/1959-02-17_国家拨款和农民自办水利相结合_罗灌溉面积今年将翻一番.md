Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 16th: Romania will expand its irrigated area by 100,000 hectares this year, doubling the existing irrigated area.

In terms of water conservancy construction, farmers in many regions have drawn up plans for self-run water conservancy projects. Constanța County's total irrigated area last year was only 4,000 hectares, but this year farmers in the county plan to realize irrigation on 30,000 hectares of land. Next year, the county's irrigated area will increase to 94,000 hectares, almost equal to the current total irrigated area of the entire country.

This year, the state will allocate 375 million lei (Romanian currency) for water conservancy and drainage projects, and will also send technical cadres to assist farmers in design work.

In addition to increasing the irrigated area by 100,000 hectares this year, drainage and soil improvement work will also be carried out on nearly 400,000 hectares of land.

In order to ensure a large increase in the production of sugar beets and vegetables, this year's water conservancy projects will pay special attention to the irrigation of these crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 15th: The Romanian countryside is stepping up preparations for spring plowing. Nearly 20,000 tractors and more than 24,000 seeders have been repaired nationwide, and more than 2.6 million tons of manure have been transported to the fields.

Hybrid corn and sunflowers are the crops to be sown in large quantities this year. State farms, collective farmers, and individual farmers are actively selecting seeds. They have selected more than 15,000 tons of seeds of various crops and are preparing to sow them more than 20 days earlier than in previous years.

Romanian farmers have only widely used manure in the past two years. In order to increase production even more, farmers everywhere are paying attention to accumulating and producing fertilizer this year. The amount of chemical fertilizer used this year will be double that of last year.

As of the end of December 1958, 4.05 million hectares of land had been deep-plowed nationwide, an increase of 44% compared to 1957.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 14th: The Romanian agricultural cooperation movement has developed rapidly in the past two months. Another ten counties and many townships across the country have completely realized collectivization or cooperation.

During this period, the agricultural cooperation movement developed the fastest in Timișoara County. A little over a month ago, the socialist agriculture in this county owned only 39.2% of the county's arable land, but now, with the exception of the mountainous areas, the entire county has basically realized cooperation, and five counties have realized full collectivization.

The rapid development of the Romanian agricultural cooperation movement is the result of the Party's strengthening of socialist education for farmers and the continuous improvement of farmers' socialist awareness. Although the weather was dry last year, many collective farms and agricultural cooperatives still achieved good harvests and higher incomes than individual farmers through collective efforts. These facts have led more individual farmers to embark on the road to collectivization. (Attached picture)

### 国家拨款和农民自办水利相结合  罗灌溉面积今年将翻一番

    国家拨款和农民自办水利相结合
    罗灌溉面积今年将翻一番
    各地农民加紧施肥选种准备春耕生产
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电　罗马尼亚今年将扩大灌溉面积十万公顷，即在现有的灌溉面积上翻一番。
    在兴修水利方面，许多地区的农民都订出了自办水利的计划。康斯坦萨州去年的全部灌溉面积只有四千公顷，但今年该州农民要在三万公顷的土地上实现水利化。明年，这个州的灌溉面积将增加到九万四千公顷，差不多等于目前全国的灌溉面积的总和。
    今年国家将拨款三亿七千五百万列伊（罗币）用于水利和排涝工程，同时还要派遣技术干部帮助农民进行设计工作。
    今年除去增加十万公顷的灌溉面积外，还要在近四十万公顷的土地上进行排涝和土壤改良工作。
    为了保证大量增加甜菜和蔬菜的产量，今年的水利工程将特别注意这些作物的灌溉问题。
    新华社布加勒斯特15日电　罗马尼亚农村正在加紧准备春耕，现在全国已经检修拖拉机近两万台，播种机二万四千多部，向地里运送粪肥二百六十多万吨。
    杂交玉米和向日葵是今年准备大量播种的作物，国营农场、集体农民和个体农民正积极选取种籽。他们已选好一万五千多吨各种作物的种籽，还准备比往年提前二十多天播种。
    罗马尼亚农民在最近两年才普遍使用粪肥，为了更多地增产，今年各地农民都很注意积肥和造肥。今年的化肥施用量将比去年增加一倍。
    截至1958年12月底，全国已深翻土地四百零五万公顷，比1957年增加44％。
    新华社布加勒斯特14日电　罗马尼亚农业合作化运动在近两个多月来迅速发展，全国又有十个县和许多乡完全实现了集体化或合作化。
    在这段时期中，农业合作化运动发 展最快的是底密索拉州。在一个多月以前，这个州的社会主义农业所拥有的土地还只占全州耕地的39.2％，但现在，除去山区外，全州已基本上实现了合作化，有五个县实现了全盘集体化。
    罗马尼亚农业合作化运动的迅速发展是党对农民加强社会主义教育和农民的社会主义觉悟不断提高的结果。去年虽然天气干旱，但是许多集体农庄和农业合作组织靠集体力量仍然获得了良好的收成，收入也比个体农民高。这些事实使更多的个体农民走上了集体化的道路。（附图片）
