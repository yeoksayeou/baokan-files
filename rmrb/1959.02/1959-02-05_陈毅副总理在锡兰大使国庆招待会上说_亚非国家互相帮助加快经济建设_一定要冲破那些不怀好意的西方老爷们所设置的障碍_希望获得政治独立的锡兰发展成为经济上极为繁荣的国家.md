Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech at the Ceylonese National Day reception held this evening by the Ceylonese Ambassador to China, Mr. Gooneratne: "We Asian and African peoples are very poor. After driving away colonialism, we can only rely on our own hard work to realize national industrialization, so as to get rid of backwardness and control our own destiny. In recent years, Asian and African countries have made certain achievements in this regard, and we are very happy about this. In the future, we should further strengthen mutual learning and mutual assistance to speed up our progress."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Shen Junru and Chen Shutong, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Burhan, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Hanfu, were invited to attend the reception.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm congratulations to the Ceylonese government and people. Chen Yi said: "Today is the eleventh anniversary of our friendly neighbor Ceylon's independence. In the past eleven years, especially in recent years, the Ceylonese government and people have made great efforts and achieved considerable success in safeguarding national independence and developing their own economy. The Chinese government and people are pleased with every positive measure taken and every achievement made by Ceylon in building its own country. We sincerely hope that Ceylon, which has already won political independence, will develop into an economically prosperous country."

In his speech, Chen Yi praised the Ceylonese government and Prime Minister Bandaranaike for their valuable efforts in maintaining Asian and world peace and promoting friendly cooperation among all countries in recent years. Ceylon adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality and advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Chen Yi said: "In the past year, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Ceylon have greatly developed. The Ceylonese government and people have consistently supported the restoration of our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations and our country's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. We are deeply grateful for this friendly attitude of the Ceylonese government and people." Chen Yi pointed out that the economic and cultural exchanges between China and Ceylon have greatly deepened the friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples. He said: "We believe that in the new year, the friendly cooperation between our two countries will be further developed, and this friendly cooperation will make greater contributions to the peaceful construction of our two countries and to the peace of Asia and the world."

After pointing out the economic development of Asian and African countries in recent years, Chen Yi emphasized: "Contrary to the thinking of the Asian and African people, some ill-intentioned leaders of Western countries have adopted a hostile attitude towards the economic development of Asian and African countries, especially China's construction achievements. In fact, this reveals their ulterior motives, which is to only allow the Asian and African people to suffer from hunger and cold forever, and not allow the Asian and African people to have any chance to stand up. If anyone violates their will, they will do everything possible to curse, slander, and sabotage, attempting to isolate you and subdue you. We Chinese people and Asian and African people will never pay attention to the nonsense of these ill-intentioned gentlemen, and we must break through all the obstacles they have set up and continue to forge ahead bravely. I believe that the day when the Asian and African people stand up and the day when the colonialists completely fail are not far away."

Ceylonese Ambassador Gooneratne spoke at the beginning of the reception. In his speech, he first read out a telegram from Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike to the government and people of the People's Republic of China:

"On the anniversary of our country's regaining its freedom, we reiterate our commitment to striving to achieve two main goals: the unity and progress of our people and peace and goodwill among the people of all countries. I am very pleased to point out that the relationship between our country and the People's Republic of China is very sincere and friendly, and I believe that this friendship will be enhanced in all aspects in the years to come."

Gooneratne then described the achievements Ceylon has made since independence. He said, "We have made achievements during the past eleven years, especially in economic development. Because if the economy is not developed, the political freedom we have regained will lack meaning."

Gooneratne said: "In our foreign policy, our country continues to follow the Panchsheel principles established at the first great Asian-African conference held in Bandung. Our country has also actively done its part to promote understanding among all countries and ease international tensions."

Gooneratne said that there is a traditional and very close friendship between Ceylon and China. In recent years, this connection has been further strengthened due to the establishment of diplomatic relations and the signing of trade agreements.

Gooneratne said: "We know that for the development of the country and the welfare of the people, our country must strive to achieve a socialist-type society. In the process of striving to achieve this goal, we have learned from the experiences and examples of our Southeast Asian neighbors, especially from the examples and inspirations of the People's Republic of China. Your achievements since liberation have made all of us, especially we Asians, feel proud and satisfied. We believe that pursuing these common goals, we will soon step into a better world."

After Ambassador Gooneratne and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and Ceylon successively. Their speeches won warm applause from Chinese and foreign guests in attendance.

Also invited to attend the reception were heads of various departments of state organs and people's organizations, people from all walks of life in the capital, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

    陈毅副总理在锡兰大使国庆招待会上说
    亚非国家互相帮助加快经济建设
    一定要冲破那些不怀好意的西方老爷们所设置的障碍
    希望获得政治独立的锡兰发展成为经济上极为繁荣的国家
    新华社4日讯　陈毅副总理今天晚间在锡兰驻华大使高伯拉瓦举行的锡兰国庆招待会的讲话中说：“我们亚非各国人民都是很穷苦的，在赶走殖民主义之后，只有靠我们自己的辛勤劳动，实现国家工业化，才能摆脱落后，掌握自己的命运。近几年来亚非国家在这一方面都取得了一定的成就，我们感到非常高兴。今后我们还应该进一步加强互相学习、互相帮助，来加快我们前进的速度。
    李先念副总理，沈钧儒、陈叔通副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫应邀出席了招待会。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国政府和人民向锡兰政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。陈毅说：“今天是我们的友邦锡兰获得独立的十一周年，十一年来，特别是最近几年来，锡兰政府和人民在维护民族独立和发展本国经济的事业中，作出了很大的努力，并且获得了不少的成就。中国政府和人民对锡兰在建设自己的国家中采取的每一个积极措施和取得的每一项成就，都感到高兴。我们衷心地希望已经赢得了政治上独立的锡兰将发展成为一个经济上极为繁荣的国家。”
    陈毅在讲话中赞扬了近几年来，锡兰政府和班达拉奈克总理在维护亚洲和世界和平和促进各国友好合作方面进行了可贵的努力，锡兰坚持奉行和平中立政策，主张和平共处五项原则。
    陈毅说：“过去一年中，中锡两国间的友好合作关系有了很大的发展。锡兰政府和人民一贯支持恢复我国在联合国的合法地位和我国解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争。对于锡兰政府和人民的这种友好态度，我们深为感谢。”陈毅指出：中锡两国在经济和文化上的交流，大大加深了两国人民间的友谊和相互了解。他说：“我们相信，在新的一年内，我们两国的友好合作将会进一步发展，而这种友好合作必将对我们两国的和平建设以及亚洲和世界的和平作出更大的贡献。”
    陈毅在指出亚非国家近几年来经济的发展以后，强调地说：“同亚非人民的想法完全相反，某些不怀好意的西方国家的领导人士，对亚非国家的经济发展特别是中国的建设成就，采取了仇视的态度。其实这正暴露了他们不可告人的目的，那就是只准亚非人民永远受饥挨冻，不准亚非人民稍有伸腰抬头的机会。如果有人违背了他们的意志，他们就竭尽一切诅咒、诬蔑和破坏的能事，企图孤立你，压服你。我们中国人民和亚非人民决不理会这些不怀好意的老爷们的胡言谰语，一定要冲破他们所设置的一切障碍，继续奋勇前进。我认为，亚非人民出头的日子和殖民主义者彻底失败的日子不会很远了。”
    锡兰驻华大使高伯拉瓦在招待会开始时讲话。他讲话时首先宣读了锡兰总理班达拉奈克致中华人民共和国政府和人民的一份电文：
    “在我国重新获得自由的纪念日的时候，我们重申致力于争取达到两项主要的目的，我国人民的团结和进步以及世界各国人民之间的和平和善意。我很感满意地指出：我国和中华人民共和国的关系是非常诚挚和友好的，我相信这种友谊在今后的岁月中将在各方面得到增进。”
    高伯拉瓦接着叙述了锡兰在独立以后所取得的成就，他说，“过去十一年期间我们取得了成就，特别是在经济发展方面。因为如果经济没有得到发展，我们所重新获得的政治自由就会缺少意义。”
    高伯拉瓦说：“我国在对外政策中，继续遵循了在万隆举行的第一次伟大的亚非国家会议所确定的潘查希拉原则。我国也积极地为促进各国间的了解和和缓国际紧张局势而尽了自己的一分努力。”
    高伯拉瓦说，锡中两国之间存在着传统的和十分亲切的友谊。近几年来，由于外交关系的建立和贸易协定的签订，这种联系得到了进一步的加强。
    高伯拉瓦说：“我们知道，为了国家的发展和人民的福利，我国必须争取实现社会主义型的社会。在争取达到这个目标的过程中，我们从东南亚各邻邦的经验和榜样，特别是从中华人民共和国的榜样和启示中得到了教益。你们解放以来的成就，使我们大家，特别是我们亚洲人感到骄傲和满意。我们相信，追求着这些共同的目标，我们不久就会跨入一个更加美好的世界。”
    高伯拉瓦大使和陈毅副总理讲话后，乐队先后高奏中锡两国国歌。他们的讲话博得了全场中外来宾热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有国家机关各部门、各人民团体的负责人，首都各界人士以及各国驻华使节。
