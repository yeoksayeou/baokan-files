    Random Thoughts on Stage Art
    Qin Li
    Stage art installations are beginning to attract the attention of various theatrical genres. For example, classical opera is also experimenting more with the use of scenery and realistic props. This is progress and a good phenomenon.
    Spoken drama has always had this good tradition, but some time ago it developed somewhat towards formalism, pursuing one-sided realism and triviality, and some were excessively luxurious. Now it has been improved. For example, the stage art design in "Li Ren Xing" has many innovations. The stage setting uses a slightly symbolic and exaggerated technique, appropriately expressing the historical environment at that time. For example, when depicting a factory, there are only a few tall chimneys in the background; when depicting the streets and alleys of the city, there is only a dim street lamp. The scenery is cleverly projected with slides, plus the rendering of lights, it looks like a painting, which is both fresh and does not reduce its authenticity at all.
    Professional art workers are also participating in the stage art design of the Peking Opera "Battle of Red Cliffs", which is also worth promoting. For example, doesn't the faint river scenery in the scene "Looking Down on Jiangnan" add to the atmosphere? However, there are also shortcomings. For example, the large screen in Zhou Yu's residence in "Dragon and Tiger Storm" is worth considering. First of all, not to mention how strong and stiff the color is and whether the matching is appropriate, even in terms of the area it occupies on the stage, it is too large. Looking up from the stage, you can only see a large screen facing you. Looking at it, you can only "see things but not people". Even if the audience stares at the people on the stage, the colorfully turbid large screen is always swaying in front of our eyes, distracting the audience's attention. It seems that stage art, especially the stage art of opera, is very particular!

    闲话舞台美术

    舞台美术装置，开始引起各个剧种的注意了。例如古典戏曲也较多的试验着运用布景和写实的道具。这是个进步，是个好现象。
    话剧一直是有这个好传统的，不过前些时候有点往形式方面发展，追求的是片面的真实和繁琐，有的也过分豪华。现在已经有所改进了。例如“丽人行”里的舞台美术设计就有不少创造，舞台布景用了带有一点象征性的夸张的手法，恰当的表现出当时的历史环境。如写工厂，背面只有简单的几支高大的烟筒；写城市的街巷只有一支昏暗的路灯，布景是用幻灯巧妙地打出来的，再加上灯光的渲染衬托，看上去简直像一幅绘画，既有新鲜感，而且丝毫也不减其真实性。
    京剧“赤壁之战”也有专业美术工作者来参与舞台美术设计，这也是值得提倡的。例如“藐江南”一场的淡淡的江景不就增添了气氛吗？不过缺点也有，如“龙虎风云”中周瑜居处的那个大幛子就值得考虑，先不说那颜色多么强烈生硬，搭配得是否适当，即以它在舞台上所占的面积来说也未免太大了，从台下往上看只见迎面一个大幛子，看来看去是“见物不见人”，即或是观众盯住台上的人，然而那颜色浓浊的大幛子总是在我们的眼前晃来晃去，分散了观众的注意力。看来，舞台美术，特别是戏曲的舞台美术是大有讲究的哩！
