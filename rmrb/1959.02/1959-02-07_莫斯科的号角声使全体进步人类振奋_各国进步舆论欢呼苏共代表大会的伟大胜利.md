Xinhua News Agency Report: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has become the focus of world opinion in recent days. Progressive newspapers and periodicals in various countries have published commentaries, cheering the great achievements of the CPSU Congress and pointing out the great significance of this congress.

    The International Communist Movement is United and Consolidated
    Revisionist Thought Suffers a Fatal Blow
    The Bulgarian newspapers "Rabotnichesko Delo," "Otechestven Front," and "Zemedelsko Zname" published editorials on the 6th, warmly congratulating the successful conclusion of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The editorial of "Rabotnichesko Delo" wrote that the 21st Congress of the CPSU "will be recorded in the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and all progressive humanity as a great milestone in the new stage of development of Soviet society and all human society."
    The editorial pointed out that this CPSU Congress once again proved how futile the conspiracies of modern revisionists, represented by the Yugoslav leadership group, the Trojan horse of imperialism, to sow confusion, create artificial contradictions, and weaken the socialist camp and the world socialist and peace forces among the communist parties and workers' parties of various countries, are. The editorial said: "The unity of the fraternal parties of various countries around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the unity of the socialist countries around the Soviet Union, is unbreakable."
    The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" emphasized that the speeches of the leaders of the communist parties of various countries at the CPSU Congress once again proved the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. The editorial pointed out that, through facts, the 21st Congress of the CPSU gave a fatal blow to revisionist thought.

    The Amazing Goals of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan
    Will Attract the Working Class of the Whole World
    The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published a commentary on the 6th, saying that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan adopted by this CPSU Congress is a decisive step in building the material and technical foundation of communism. The commentary pointed out that the historical significance and great power of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan alarmed the enemy.
    Communist Party of India newspapers in various regions published editorials, cheering the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. "Jana Sakti," the Tamil newspaper of the Madras State organization of the CPI, wrote that the amazing goals of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan "will be a revelation to all those who doubt the potential of the socialist system." The newspaper said that the achievements of the Soviet Union will inevitably attract the working class of the whole world.
    The Greek newspaper "Avgi" pointed out: "Khrushchev's report has received the most profound response throughout the world. People in all countries are judging communism based on actions and figures that determine the path of progress and prosperity."
    When talking about the goal of the Soviet Union catching up with and surpassing the economic level of the most developed capitalist countries in the peaceful economic competition in the next seven years, "Kansan Uutiset," the newspaper of the Finnish People's Democratic League, said that this CPSU Congress is a new and extremely important step on the road to the victory of socialism.

    The Soviet Union's Strong Power Defends Peace
    The Seven-Year Plan is a Negation of War
    The Greek newspaper "Avgi" wrote that people all over the world associate their hopes for peace with the 21st Congress of the CPSU. When talking about Khrushchev's report, the newspaper wrote: The Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year "plan itself is a negation of war." The strengthening and prosperity of the socialist world is changing the balance of power and making socialism an all-powerful defender of peace.
    The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial on the 2nd, saying that all the working people of Japan are sincerely pleased with the increasingly expanded dominant position of the socialist camp and the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.
    "Akahata" welcomed Khrushchev's proposal at the CPSU Congress to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone throughout the Pacific region, believing that this proposal is completely in line with the demands of the Japanese people.

    The Soviet Union is a Friend in Need to the People of All Countries
    The Seven-Year Plan Inspires the National Liberation Struggle
    The Iraqi newspaper "al-Khabar" wrote in its commentary on Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the CPSU: "The people of the Arab countries and the people of Asia and Africa have found their faithful friend in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has supported them when they have suffered crises and difficulties. It has always stood with them and done everything possible to counter imperialist aggression against them. The people of these countries are very happy to hear the assurances that Khrushchev (at the congress) has once again put forward." The newspaper said that the assurances the Soviet Union has given to the people of various countries who are struggling give the people of these countries new hope and encouragement.
    The Iraqi newspaper "al-Bilad" said that the Seven-Year Plan formulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the many achievements it has made have set an example that encourages the people who have not yet been liberated to fight for liberation.
    In its editorial on the relationship between the Soviet Union and other countries, the Cambodian newspaper "Peuple" emphasized that this relationship has always been based on complete equality.
