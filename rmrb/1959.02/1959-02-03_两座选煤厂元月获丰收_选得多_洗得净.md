Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 2nd. At the beginning of the new year, the workers of the Shuangyashan Central Coal Preparation Plant achieved a double harvest in terms of clean coal output and quality. In January, the plant's daily output of clean coal reached a maximum of 5,000 tons, with an average daily output of about 3,500 tons, an increase of 20% compared with the average daily output last year. Currently, all the workers are working with great enthusiasm to provide more clean coal for the Marshal of Steel.

The plant was put into production on September 20 last year. The entire production process in the plant is mechanized, and the operating technology is relatively complex. Thanks to the factory Party organization's leadership in improving the technical level of workers and promoting the Soviet Union's advanced coal preparation operating experience, the output and quality of clean coal have been greatly improved. At present, the plant's clean coal recovery rate has increased from 65% in the past to 77.67%. In terms of clean coal quality, the ash content has been reduced from 11% in the past to 9.4%. The reduction of ash content in clean coal is of great benefit to saving coke consumption and improving pig iron quality in iron-smelting blast furnaces. According to the plant's calculations, every 1% reduction in the ash content of coking clean coal can save 2.5% of coke consumption in blast furnaces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 2nd. The modern Huainan Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant, which was put into production at the end of last year, washed and processed more than 80,000 tons of raw coal in January, exceeding the monthly plan by 15%.

The Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant specializes in providing coking clean coal for the Marshal of Steel, and the entire production process is mechanized and automated. At present, the large amount of clean coal it washes is being continuously transported to steel plants in Hefei, Ma'anshan, Wuhan and other places.

Since the Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant has only recently been put into production, a few pieces of equipment have not yet been fully equipped, which has brought certain difficulties to production; however, the workers of the entire plant have eliminated these difficulties with a spirit of hard work and ingenuity. In addition, the workers also reasonably adjusted the labor organization, changing the two-shift production to three-shift production without increasing personnel, further bringing out the potential of the machines.

### 两座选煤厂元月获丰收  选得多　洗得净

    两座选煤厂元月获丰收
    选得多　洗得净
    新华社哈尔滨2日电　双鸭山中央选煤厂职工新年一开始就在精煤产量和质量方面获得了双丰收。1月份，这个厂的精煤日产量最高达到五千吨，平均日产量达到了三千五百吨左右，比去年平均日产量提高20％。目前全厂职工干劲冲天，正在为钢铁元帅提供更大量的精煤。
    这个厂是在去年9月20日投入生产的。厂内生产过程全部机械化，操作技术比较复杂。由于工厂党组织领导职工提高技术水平，推广了苏联先进的选煤操作经验，精煤产量和质量都飞跃提高。目前，这个厂的精煤回收率已由过去的65％提高到77.67％。在精煤质量方面，含灰率已由过去的11％降低到9.4％。精煤灰分的降低，对于炼铁高炉节省焦炭用量、提高生铁质量有很大的好处。据这个厂的计算，炼焦精煤的灰分每降低1％，就可以使高炉节省焦炭用量2.5％。
    据新华社合肥2日电　去年底投入生产的现代化淮南望峰岗洗选厂，1月份洗选了八万多吨原煤，超额15％完成了月度计划。
    望峰岗洗选厂是专门为钢铁元帅提供炼焦精煤的，生产过程全部是机械化、自动化。目前，它所洗选的大量精煤，正在向合肥、马鞍山、武汉等地的钢铁厂源源运送。
    望峰岗洗选厂由于刚投入生产不久，少数设备还没有来得及配齐，因而给生产上带来了一定的困难；但是全厂职工以猛干巧干的精神排除了这些困难。此外，职工们还合理地调整了劳动组织，在不增加人员的情况下，把两班生产改为三班生产，进一步发挥了机器潜力。（附图片）
