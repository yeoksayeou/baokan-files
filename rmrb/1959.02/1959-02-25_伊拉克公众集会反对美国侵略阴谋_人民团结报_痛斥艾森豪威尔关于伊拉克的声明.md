Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 23rd: The Iraqi public is disturbed by the aggressive plans of American imperialism and its running dogs in the Near East. Iraqi social organizations are now holding mass rallies and various gatherings, condemning the policy of participating in military treaties and concluding bilateral military agreements with imperialism, and demanding the expansion of the struggle for peace.

A mass rally was held a few days ago in Al-Hindiya, a small city in central Iraq. Representatives from Baghdad, Karbala, Kadhimiya, Najaf, Diwaniyah, and Hilla peace fighters also attended the mass rally. Many Iraqi public representatives who spoke at the meeting—poets, lawyers, representatives of local peace committees, and representatives of the Iraqi Women's Rights Defense League—condemned the warmongers' conspiracies and called for the struggle to defend peace.

In addition, a mass rally attended by more than 5,000 people was held at a stadium in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. Speakers called for Arab countries to unite to jointly deal with the conspiracies of imperialism and called for the struggle for freedom, peace, and the consolidation of Iraq's democratic system. The participants sent congratulatory letters to the Algerian and Omani people who are fighting for freedom and independence, and to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 22nd: The Iraqi newspaper "People's Solidarity" published an editorial today refuting Eisenhower's recent statement on Iraq.

When talking about Iraqi affairs at a press conference on February 18, Eisenhower said that the United States hopes Iraq will establish a "free government." He also expressed his concern about the danger of communism in Iraq.

The newspaper said that the people of Arab countries cannot forget that the so-called "free world" headed by the United States is a world of imperialism and military alliances, a world of aggression and conspiracies against Arab countries, and a world of massacres in Algeria and southern Arabia. The "democratic" actions of this world produced the Suez Canal incident and Palestinian refugees. The so-called "free" government that Dulles and Eisenhower hope Iraq will establish is a government in the style of Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Nuri al-Said.

The newspaper said that the purpose of spreading the widely publicized lie about socialist countries migrating Jews to Israel is to undermine the relationship between Arab countries and socialist countries and to cover up the true conspiracies of the imperialists against the Arab people.

    伊拉克公众集会反对美国侵略阴谋
    “人民团结报”痛斥艾森豪威尔关于伊拉克的声明
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社巴格达23日讯：美帝国主义及其走狗对近东的侵略计划使伊拉克公众感到不安。伊拉克各社会团体现在正在纷纷举行群众大会和各种集会，谴责参加军事条约和与帝国主义缔结双边军事协定的政策，并且要求扩大争取和平的斗争。
    前几天，伊拉克中部的一个小城市阿欣迪亚市举行了一次群众大会。参加群众大会的还有来自巴格达、克伯拉、卡希米、纳杰夫、迪旺尼亚和希拉的和平战士的代表团。在会上发言的许多伊拉克公众代表——诗人、律师、当地保卫和平委员会的代表和伊拉克维护女权联盟的代表都谴责了战争挑拨者的阴谋，并且呼吁为保卫和平而斗争。
    此外，在伊拉克首都巴格达的一个运动场上还举行了一个有五千多人参加的群众大会。演说者呼吁阿拉伯国家团结一致，共同对付帝国主义的阴谋，呼吁为自由、和平和巩固伊拉克的民主制度而斗争。与会者分别向正在为自由和独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民和阿曼人民、以及正在莫斯科举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议发出了贺信。
    新华社巴格达22日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”今天发表社论，驳斥艾森豪威尔最近关于伊拉克的声明。
    艾森豪威尔2月18日在记者招待会上谈到伊拉克事务时说，美国希望伊拉克建立一个“自由的政府”。他并且表示，他对伊拉克国内的共产党危险感到忧虑。
    这家报纸说，阿拉伯各国人民不能忘记，以美国为首的所谓“自由世界”是帝国主义和军事联盟世界，是侵略和对阿拉伯各国策划阴谋的世界，是在阿尔及利亚和阿拉伯南部，进行屠杀的世界。这个世界的“民主”行动产生了塞得港事件和巴勒斯坦难民。杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔希望伊拉克建立的所谓“自由”政府是蒋介石、李承晚和努里·赛义德式的政府。
    这家报纸在谈到大肆宣传的所谓社会主义国家迁移犹太人到以色列的谎言时说，这种宣传的目的是要破坏阿拉伯同社会主义国家的关系，并且掩盖帝国主义者反对阿拉伯人的真正阴谋。
