    Hoping for Another Flower to Bloom
    Li Ji

    Spring is a time when flowers fly everywhere. In the vast mountains and fields of Gansu, "Hua'er" (folk songs) are like a gentle spring breeze, drifting in the air above every labor site, encouraging and nourishing the hearts of millions of people surging forward. This folk song form, which is both good at lyricism and suitable for narration, is an important artistic creation form for the working people in Gansu and Qinghai to express their thoughts and feelings, and express their joys and sorrows. At the same time, it is also a very valuable contribution of the working people in literary and artistic creation, and an important source for all literary and artistic workers to learn and create. This is a boundless and continuous ocean. With its vigorous vitality, it radiates dazzling brilliance day by day.

    Like all literary and artistic forms that can be passed down among the people for a long time, "Hua'er" has its own broad and deep mass base. Whether you love it or not, the masses like it like "the apple of their eye" and regard it as their treasure. This is a question worth pondering by every literary and art worker.

    Recently, on the Yintao construction site, I particularly felt the importance of this issue. Whether it is among the construction workers at the ancient city dam, or on the canal lines of the Dingxi working area, where various means of transportation are blooming, whether it is on the dangerous Jiudian Gorge, where even birds find it hard to fly, or in the ranks of migrant workers deeply splitting Zongdan Mountain, there is a chorus of "Hua'er" songs everywhere, rising and falling, echoing each other remotely. In this communist project, "Hua'er" has simply become an important weapon to encourage people to carry out selfless labor through propaganda and mobilization.

    In many conversations with male and female "Hua'er" singers among the migrant workers on the construction site, as well as comrades engaged in literary and artistic work, many people directly or indirectly expressed this desire and request - to bring "Hua'er" to the stage so that it can better serve our socialist construction cause and our Great Leap Forward.

    This is a very good initiative. As long as our musicians can collect and sort out the more than a dozen "Hua'er" tunes that are currently popular and dozens of other folk songs circulating among the people in Gansu, and give them musical processing and improvement; as long as our writers, playwrights and the numerous amateur literary and art enthusiasts among the working people cooperate to create various scripts, large and small, that reflect the current real life, and give it a theatrical form with Gansu local characteristics, I believe that a new type of opera with strong vitality and loved by the people of Gansu - "Huaqu" (Flower Opera), will appear on the stage in the near future. In fact, the first repertoire of "Huaqu" has recently appeared on the Yintao construction site. This is "Repairing Roads," which was created and performed by male and female "Hua'er" singers from the Lintao working area migrant workers with the assistance of professional literary and art workers. This is an extremely valuable attempt and a valuable beginning. Its first performance won warm applause and sincere love from the migrant workers.

    Some people say: "'Hua'er' has low artistic value." This is either due to ignorance, or the arrogance of those ugly "art for art's sake" people.

      "'Hua'er' has a monotonous tune, singing the same tune over and over again." This is a statement that lacks both investigation and analysis. Just in terms of the major systems, "Hua'er" tunes can be divided into three different types: Lianhua Mountain, Linxia, and Qinghai. In the places where "Hua'er" is popular, there are often two or more different ways of singing in each county. If we add other folk songs from various parts of Gansu, our "Huaqu" will be a new type of opera with dozens or even hundreds of tunes.

    "'Hua'er' is only popular in a few areas of Gansu and does not have a large mass base." More than two-thirds of the counties and cities in Gansu Province have people singing "Hua'er." Is this a "minority area"? In terms of population, nearly ten million people are singing "Hua'er." Compared with the works of those artists who are obsessed with creating "heavenly books" in the eyes of the masses, which one has a larger "mass base"?

    "There are already many types of operas on the stage, why create another new type of opera by trying to be different?" Yes, there are indeed many types of operas now, but flowers are never too many, the more the merrier. For example, if you want to build a park, in addition to peonies and roses, it is a good thing or a bad thing to plant a peony? Moreover, this also includes the issue of the mass cultural life of nearly ten million people in most parts of Gansu.

    Considering from the aspects of encouraging millions of people to hold high the red flag and make a great leap forward, enriching and fulfilling the people's cultural life, and the artistry and mass character of "Hua'er" itself, bringing "Hua'er" to the stage is a practical problem that needs to be solved urgently. I hope that professional and amateur literary and art workers who are interested in this, especially the vast number of "Hua'er" singers, will work together and cultivate diligently, so that Gansu people can work better, live better, sing better, and laugh better, and open a new flower that is fragrant and colorful!

    希望再开一朵花   
    李季
    春日无处不飞花，在甘肃辽阔的山野间，“花儿”像和煦的春风，飘荡在每一个劳动工地的上空，鼓舞着、滋润着千万颗跃进的心灵。这种既长于抒情，又适于叙事的民歌形式，是甘肃、青海一带劳动人民，表达思想感情，抒发欢乐忧伤的重要艺术创作形式。同时，它也是劳动人民在文艺创作上的极可宝贵的贡献，也是所有文学艺术工作者学习、创作的重要源泉。这是一片汪洋无际、川流不息的海洋。它以自己旺盛的生命力，日新月异地放射着夺目的光彩。
    就像所有能够在人民中长期传诵的文艺形式一样，“花儿”有它自己的广泛、深厚的群众基础。不论你是否爱它，群众却像“心头肉”似的喜欢它，把它看作自己的珍宝。这是值得每一个文艺工作者深思的问题。
    最近，我在引洮工地上，更是特别突出地感觉到这一问题的重要。不论是在古城拦河坝的施工人群中，还是在各种运输工具百花齐放的定西工区的渠线上，不论是在艰险难坏飞鸟的九甸峡上，或是在移山倒海的宗丹深劈的民工行列里，到处是一片“花儿”歌声，此起彼落，遥相唱和。“花儿”在这个共产主义的工程中，简直成了鼓舞人们进行忘我劳动的重要的宣传鼓动的武器。
    在和工地上民工中男、女“花儿”歌手，以及从事文艺工作同志们的多次谈话中，许多人都直接、间接地表示了这种愿望和要求——把“花儿”搬上舞台，使它更好地为我们社会主义建设事业，为我们的大跃进服务。
    这是一个很好的倡议。只要我们的音乐家们，能把现在流行的十几种“花儿”曲调和传唱在甘肃民间的几十种其他民歌，收集、整理起来，在音乐上给以加工、提高；只要我们的作家、戏剧家和为数众多的劳动人民中的业余文艺爱好者共同合作，创作出各种大大小小的反映当前现实生活的剧本，并给予它以具有甘肃地方特色的戏剧形式，我相信，一个有着强烈生命力并为甘肃人民所喜闻乐见的新的剧种——“花曲”，不久的将来，就会出现在舞台上。事实上，在引洮工地上，最近已经出现了“花曲”的第一个剧目，这就是临洮工区民工中的男、女“花儿”歌手们，在专业文艺工作者的协助下，所创作和演出的“修路”。这是一个极有价值的尝试，也是一个可贵的开端，它的第一次演出，就赢得了民工们热烈的掌声和衷心的喜爱。
    有人说：“‘花儿’艺术性低。”这不是由于无知，就是那种丑恶的“艺术至上”者的自大狂。
      “‘花儿’曲调单调，唱来唱去就是那一个调调。”这是既没有调查研究，又缺乏分析的说法。“花儿”曲调仅就大系来分，就有莲花山、临夏、青海三类各不相同的曲调，在“花儿”流行的地方，往往每个县就有两种以上的不同的唱法，假若再加上甘肃各地的其他民歌，我们的“花曲”，就将是一个拥有几十种以至百多种曲调的新型的剧种了。
    “‘花儿’只流行在甘肃少数地区，群众性不大。”甘肃全省三分之二以上的县市，都有人吟唱“花儿”，这是“少数地区”吗？按人口来说，有近千万人都在传唱“花儿”，这和那些终日醉心于创作群众视为“天书”的艺术家们的作品相比，到底哪一个“群众性”大呢？
    “目前舞台上的剧种，已经不少，何必再标新立异地另搞一个剧种。”是的，目前剧种的确不少了，但是，花不厌多，越多越香。比如你要修建一座公园，除了芍药、玫瑰，再种上一株牡丹，这到底是好事还是坏事呢？况且，这里还包含着一个甘肃大部分地区近千万人口的群众文化生活问题。
    从鼓舞千百万人民举红旗大跃进，从丰富和充实人民的文化生活，从“花儿”本身的艺术性、群众性等方面考虑，“花儿”上舞台，这已是一个极待解决的现实问题。希望有志于此的专业、业余的文艺工作者，特别是广大的“花儿”歌手们，共同努力，辛勤培育，为甘肃人民劳动得更好，生活得更好，唱得更好，笑得更好而开放出一朵香气袭人，色彩鲜艳的新花来！
