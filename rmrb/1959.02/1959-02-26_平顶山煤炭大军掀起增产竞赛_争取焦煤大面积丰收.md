    Pingdingshan Coal Miners Launch Production Increase Competition
    Striving for Large-Scale Harvest of Coking Coal
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Pingdingshan Coal Mine's coal miners are fighting hard to complete and overfulfill the annual production target of six million tons of coking coal. The current raw coal production has jumped from an average daily output of over 4,000 tons in January to around 6,000 tons per day. On the evening of the 19th, after the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) put forward higher requirements to the Pingdingshan Coal Mine in a telephone conference, the Pingdingshan Municipal Committee of the CCP immediately made arrangements at the on-going on-site meeting on high yield per unit area, deciding to launch a high-production movement, striving to reach a daily output of 8,000 tons of raw coal and break through the 10,000-ton mark this month.
    After the Pingdingshan Municipal Committee of the CCP issued a call to tens of thousands of coal miners in the city to produce six million tons of coking coal this year, it mobilized the masses to discuss, express opinions, and debate. In addition, it also convened a city-wide worker representative meeting and an advanced producer representative meeting, assigning tasks and measures to the masses and organizing the exchange of advanced experiences.
    The Pingdingshan Coal Mine is currently focusing on achieving high yields in unit work areas to realize large-scale harvests. The 4151 recovery work area of the Leigutai Mine has proposed an initiative to the entire mine to create a high-yield work area, launching a unit area high-yield competition throughout the mine. Currently, twelve recovery areas are participating in the competition. On the 19th, the Mining Bureau held an on-site meeting at this mine, studying the proposed targets, technical measures, and evaluation and reward methods. The proposed targets include a monthly output of 20,000 tons for work areas of 60 meters or more, a monthly output of 15,000 tons for work areas of less than 60 meters, a per-worker efficiency of 4 tons per shift in the recovery work area, and a consumption of 24 cubic meters of pit props per 1,000 tons of coal. The technical measures mainly include vigorously promoting parallel operations, concentrating superior forces to carry out multi-cycle operations, strengthening production preparation, carrying out high-speed tunneling, and maintaining sufficient mining faces and a certain number of backup mining faces to ensure continuous high yields per unit area. Secondly, promote mechanized coal mining, and make full use of all existing mining and tunneling machinery and equipment in a short period of time. Vigorously rectify labor organization, rationally use labor, improve production efficiency, rapidly improve the technical level of new workers, and provide comprehensive training to all new workers in the second half of the year, so that they can operate independently under normal circumstances.
    Currently, leading comrades of the Pingdingshan Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau are going deep into the mines and directing the battle on the front lines to promote coal production to a new stage.

    平顶山煤炭大军掀起增产竞赛
    争取焦煤大面积丰收
    本报讯　平顶山煤矿煤炭大军，正在为完成和超额完成全年生产炼焦煤六百万吨的任务而奋战。现在原煤产量已由1月份平均日产四千多吨，跃到日产六千吨左右。19日晚，中共河南省委在电话会议上给平顶山煤矿提出更高的要求后，中共平顶山市委立即在正在召开的单位面积丰产现场会议上作了部署，决定掀起高产运动，在本月份争取达到日产原煤八千吨和突破万吨大关。
    中共平顶山市委向全市数万名煤炭大军，发出今年生产炼焦煤六百万吨的号召之后，曾发动群众讨论，展开鸣放和辩论。另外，还召开了全市职工代表会议和先进生产者代表会议，向群众交任务，交措施，组织交流先进经验。
    平顶山煤矿目前正在大搞单位工作面的丰产，通过单位工作面丰产来实现大面积丰收。擂鼓台矿四一五一回采工作面已经向全矿提出了创造高产工作面的倡议，在全矿开展单位面积丰产竞赛。目前参加竞赛的已有十二个回采面。19日，矿务局在这个矿召开现场会议，研究了倡议指标和技术措施以及评比奖励办法。倡议指标包括六十公尺以上的工作面月产二万吨，六十公尺以下的工作面月产一万五千吨，回采工作面全员效率每工达到四吨，坑木每千吨消耗二十四立方公尺等。在技术措施上，主要是大力推行平行作业，集中优势兵力大搞多循环作业，加强生产准备工作，开展高速掘进，保持有足够的采面和一定数量的备用采面，以便使单位面积连续丰产。其次，推行机械化采煤，在短时间内要把现有采掘机械设备全部利用起来。大力整顿劳动组织，合理使用劳力，提高生产效率，迅速提高新工人的技术水平，在下半年将所有的新工人普训一遍，达到在一般情况下，能够单独操作。
    目前，平顶山市委和矿务局的领导同志均分别深入井下，亲临前线指挥战斗，促进煤炭生产跃上一个新的阶段。
