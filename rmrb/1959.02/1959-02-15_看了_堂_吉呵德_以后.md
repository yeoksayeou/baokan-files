　　After Seeing "Don Quixote"
　　Qin Li
　　After watching the Soviet film "Don Quixote," we were amazed by the genius performance of Cherkasov, who created the image of this Spanish nobleman, as if Don Quixote had stepped directly from the book onto the silver screen.
　　We can hardly see any traces of the roles Cherkasov has played in the past. If we hadn't known beforehand that he was playing the protagonist, how could we have believed that this was the Cherkasov who played Prince Alexei in "Ivan the Terrible," "Peter the Great," and Popov in "The Genius Inventor"? How skillfully he portrayed these distinct personalities! Isn't it an enjoyment to see such a performance?
　　The actor who played Don Quixote's loyal companion, Panza, also created a charming character, reminding us of the saying "A red flower needs green leaves to set it off."
  I also thought of some performances in our theaters. We often encounter a situation where, although the repertoire has changed and the identities of the characters have changed, we can still see shadows of the actor's previous roles when watching the play. Especially some of the supporting characters, it seems that there is no big difference between this play and that play, the personalities are the same, the demeanor is the same, and the impression on the audience is faint.
　　This shows that the actors' ability to master the roles needs to be improved, and the extent to which playwrights create characters and directors care about minor roles is also very important. What today's audience wants to see is always a stage full of good performances. It seems that there are fewer and fewer people who only pay attention to seeing famous actors like in the past.
　　Of course, it is not realistic to ask all our actors to reach the level of a master like Cherkasov all at once. But our demands are not too harsh. We require that the roles, big and small, that appear on the stage have a power to attract the audience, so that we don't see shadows of previous roles in them.

    看了“堂·吉呵德”以后
    秦犁
    看了苏联影片“堂·吉呵德”，我们惊异于创造了这位西班牙贵族形象的契尔卡索夫的天才表演，好像堂·吉呵德直接从书本上走下来跳上银幕了。
    在契尔卡索夫的身上，我们简直看不出他过去演过的一些角色的影子，如果我们不是事先知道了是他饰演主角的话，我们怎能相信这就是演过“伊凡雷帝”、“彼得大帝”中皇子阿列克塞和“天才发明家”中的波波夫的契尔卡索夫呢？他多么熟练地表现了这些鲜明的性格！看了这样的演出，能不说是一种享受吗？
    饰演堂·吉呵德的忠实的同伴——班沙的演员也创造了一个富有魅力的角色，他让我们想起了“红花还得绿叶衬”这一句话来。
  我也联想到我们剧院里的一些演出，我们常会遇到这样一种情况，虽然剧目换过了，剧中人的身份也变了，然而我们在看戏时总还能看到演员从前演过的一些角色的影子，特别是剧中的一些配角，好像在这个戏和那个戏里没有什么太大的分别，性格是雷同的，风度是雷同的，给观众的印象是淡的。
    这说明演员掌握角色的能力还要提高，而剧作家如何创造人物和导演是否关心次要角色恐怕也有很大关系。今天的观众所想看的总是要满台的好戏，像过去光讲究看名角儿的人恐怕越来越少了。
    自然，一下子就要让我们所有的演员都达到像契尔卡索夫这样的大师的水平，也是不实际的。但是我们的要求也不算苛刻，我们要求舞台上出现的大大小小的角色都有一种吸引观众的力量，让我们不要在他们的身上看到以往角色的影子。
