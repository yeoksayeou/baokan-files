Eliminating the Four Pests, Emphasizing Hygiene, Transforming the Mountainous Landscape
    ——Introducing the Patriotic Health Campaign in Jianning County, Fujian Province
    Wen Hua
    At the National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition, there is a group of exhibits and a film documentary introducing the new atmosphere in Jianning County, Fujian Province, after the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene. This county is located in the mountainous area of western Fujian. In the past, life was hard, hygiene was poor, and diseases were prevalent. Malaria caused by mosquitoes had names like "March Green Grass Fever," "April Yellow Bamboo Fever," "May Lotus Fever," and "September Osmanthus Fever." At that time, the popular folk song said: "Minor illnesses are suffered through, major illnesses require buying a coffin." Since liberation, a nationwide patriotic health campaign has been carried out since 1952. In 1958, a high tide of the movement was set off. The "four pests," such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows, were eliminated in large numbers, and the sanitary conditions of the entire county were completely renewed. In some places, the masses began to not use mosquito nets in the summer. The incidence of various diseases has decreased, and malaria has been basically eliminated.

    Putting Politics in Command, Secretaries Taking Action
    The experience of Jianning County in carrying out the patriotic health campaign is, first of all, to overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking among some cadres and strengthen the Party's leadership.

    At the beginning of the movement in 1958, some cadres believed that the mountainous area had poor conditions and tense production labor, and that there were many difficulties in carrying out the elimination of the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. They advocated piecemeal and gradual progress. The county party committee organized cadres to study the Party's instructions and analyzed the favorable conditions in Jianning County: the people in the mountainous area have a common desire to eliminate the pain of disease and liberate productive forces; the masses' awareness and hygiene level have been improved in the health campaign over the past few years; the Party has also explored certain experiences in leading the health campaign, unifying the ideological understanding of cadres. From the county to the township, the party committees at all levels were headed by the secretary and closely combined with production to carry out the patriotic health campaign. In the work, the "five unifications" and "eight grasps" were implemented. The "five unifications" meant unified leadership, deployment, inspection, reporting, and summarization together with other work. The "eight grasps" meant grasping planning, key points, arrangements, typical examples, advanced elements, observation, and seasons. This changed the situation in the past where the health department fought alone, and organized various departments to actively cooperate and fight together. The Communist Youth League took the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene as one of the contents of the consolidation of the League, and carried out commando activities; the commercial and transportation departments organized peddlers to go to the countryside to supply tools and materials for the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene; the people's schools taught hygiene classes; primary and secondary schools, theater troupes, cultural centers, wired broadcasting, film teams, county newspapers, science popularization, etc., all carried out propaganda activities under the unified leadership of the Party.

    The county party committee adopted the leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, directly grasping Xikou Town as a typical example, creating experience, and organizing various townships to observe Xikou twice during the spring shock campaign, and holding a on-site evaluation meeting to set off a wave of "learning from Xikou and catching up with Xikou" in the county. Some cadres from the county and district organs and health departments were also in charge of ten key towns respectively, using points to drive the surface and promote the development of the movement in the county.

    In the movement, leading cadres personally took action and fought with the masses. Three secretaries conducted pilot projects of major reforms of pigsties in Shuinan and Xikou respectively; First Secretary Wang Yingxian participated in the experiment of the efficacy of wild plants in killing flies and mosquitoes. Secretary Qin Jiyao personally inspected the sanitation of the urban area and swept the streets with the residents, and searched for sparrows with the commando team in the middle of the night; Many cadres from counties, districts, and townships participated in the health promotion team to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with hygiene. Some leading cadres from districts and townships have also become experts in eliminating the four pests. The actions of the leading cadres have greatly promoted the development of the movement.

    The Health Campaign Serves Production
    In 1958, Jianning County closely combined production with the patriotic health campaign.

    The county party committee listed the work of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene as one of the contents of various production plans and evaluations. Party committees at all levels implemented unified leadership, grasped the principles of "minor efforts during busy times, major efforts during less busy times, and vigorous efforts during free times" and "shock - regular - shock." Under the premise of ensuring production tasks, attention was paid to labor organization, time arrangement and task queueing, giving full play to the role of non-major labor forces in health work, so that production and hygiene were not neglected.

    In the movement, the organization that directed production was also the organization of the patriotic health campaign, and the production team was also the sanitation team. The peasants carried tools when they went up the mountains and down to the fields, and used their breaks to eliminate the four pests. The work implemented the combination of accumulating fertilizer and cleaning the environment, the combination of building water conservancy and dredging ditches, and the combination of reforming livestock and poultry pens and nests with basic construction of fertilizer accumulation. After a thorough cleaning of the county (ditches), two selections (livestock manure, fruit peels), three cleans (courtyards, corners, houses), four digs (weeds, ditch mud, floor mud, garbage), seven reforms (pigsties, cattle pens, chicken and duck coops, toilets, polluted ditches, kitchens and dead corners), sweeping the bottom of eight (bottom of beds, bottom of tanks, bottom of boxes, bottom of mills, bottom of tables, bottom of warehouses, bottom of manure tanks, bottom of stoves), more than 10 million piculs of sanitary fertilizer were accumulated in ten months, supporting agricultural production. In the spring, combined with water conservancy construction, 8,700 ditches were dredged. During the busy farming season, maternal and child health care work was carried out in combination with the needs of production. More than 500 midwives were trained in the county, and 64 rural maternity hospitals were established, basically popularizing the new midwifery method. About 2,000 nursery teachers were trained, and more than 350 rural childcare organizations were established. Attention was paid to the hygiene of public canteens, and the system of dividing food was promoted. The "four haves" were implemented in the canteens: there were sanitation on duty, the bowls and chopsticks were disinfected, there were boiled water and hand-washing equipment, and the cooks had masks and work clothes. Endemic diseases were investigated in rural areas, and mass prevention and treatment were carried out in a timely manner according to the season of onset, basically eliminating diseases such as malaria. Last September, the county party committee took advantage of the time in the middle of summer and autumn to grasp the treatment of filariasis, which ended just before the busy autumn harvest season. Not only did it not affect production, but it also increased the attendance rate during the busy autumn season and promoted production.

    Emancipating the Mind, Mobilizing the Masses
    When carrying out the movement to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, many people once thought that the four pests were just small things and did not need to "make a big fuss"; Some people were afraid that the four pests could not be eliminated, but would delay production. A few people also had superstitious ideas, saying that "mice are the stove god's pigs," "hitting flies will make you blind," and "malaria is a peaceful disease," which hindered the development of the movement.

    The party committees at all levels conducted in-depth education in light of the masses' thinking, and carried out a major hygiene debate in the county. With the production team as the unit, five to seven days were allocated to debate "why eliminate the four pests," "can the four pests be eliminated," "will eliminating the four pests affect production," and "how can we eliminate the four pests." Historical materials and examples of the harm of the four pests to the masses were collected, and the masses were mobilized to recall, compare, and take stock by means of physical exhibitions and personal experiences to clear away various ideological obstacles. Yu Shuisheng, a farmer in Xikou Town, found a dead rat in the granary. When he dissected it, there were still two liang of grain left in its belly. The party branch seized on this fact to take stock of the food that rats and sparrows had damaged from the masses. The party organization in Junkou District led the masses to calculate six accounts: the account of eliminating the four pests to reduce diseases, the account of rats destroying farm tools, furniture, and clothes, the account of rats and sparrows damaging food, the account of doing a good job in sanitary fertilizer accumulation to increase production, the account of field rats burrowing holes and endangering water conservancy construction, and the account of spending on superstitious practices of seeking Buddha and worshiping gods. After the masses calculated the accounts and compared them, they were shocked and said: "If you don't hit the drum, it won't sound, and if you don't calculate the accounts, it won't be clear. If you don't eliminate the four pests, you will never stop fighting."

    At the same time, hygiene propaganda was carried out. The county held more than a dozen large-scale radio conferences and action conferences. Townships, communities, and production teams also held various types of meetings at all levels, using forms such as mountain songs, fast talk, and ditties to publicize the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene. According to incomplete statistics, the county organized 155 health art propaganda activities, 55 on-site observation activities, screened 198 health slides and movies, and compiled 29 kinds of health propaganda materials such as "Eight Pests Map" and "Eliminate the Four Pests Mountain Song." Blackboards, wall newspapers, local broadcasts, slogans, and leaflets were also mobilized to play their roles. Big-character posters have become an effective weapon to promote the movement.

    Townships, communities, and teams also widely organized visits, evaluations, and on-site meetings. The masses said: "It is not credible to say it, it is true to see it with your own eyes, who is good and who is bad, it is clear to compare." The county's propaganda and mobilization work was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and more than 98% of adults received three to five hygiene knowledge educations. The provincial appraisal team interviewed twenty-one old people and children in the most remote Daling Village, and nineteen people could tell the meaning of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene.

    With the masses mobilized, more than 1,240 organizations of various types, such as youth commando teams, juvenile persuasion teams, and local gun teams, were formed in the county. The team members all used the gaps in production and study to participate in the health campaign. The youth commando team members in Chengguan and Xikou Town put ladders on boats and climbed to the city walls several meters high to dig up grass roots. More than 20 households with five guarantees in Xianhe Township also organized an elderly team, all of whom actively participated in sanitation. In the movement to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, more than 6,000 activists and more than 3,000 rat and sparrow extermination experts emerged in the county. More than 1.7 million rats and sparrows have been eliminated in the county.

    Working Hard and Working Smart, Shocking and Regular
    At the beginning of the movement, the masses had great enthusiasm, but there were two deviations. One was to regard the health campaign as a period of cleaning, brushing the floor, washing furniture, etc., ignoring the elimination of the breeding grounds of the four pests. The so-called "cutting grass without removing roots, the spring breeze blows again," the surface is well done, but the four pests cannot be eliminated; One is to simply rely on drugs, forming "disinfection and disinfection again, all relying on 666," spending manpower and financial resources, and the effect is not great. After the county party committee discovered it, it studied and eliminated the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and flies from improving environmental hygiene, combined with large-scale cleaning to carry out drug fumigation, eliminated overwintering mosquitoes and flies, and focused on tools, grasping experience, and exploring the creativity of the masses to sort out and promote. Banliao Township created a simple and effective tool for catching field rats, the "bamboo bow hanging cylinder." The county party committee organized the health department to study and rush to produce more than 100 pieces, which were carried by the water conservancy comfort team to the countryside. The tools were quickly promoted, and more than 40,000 pieces were manufactured in ten days, almost one per person, forming a climax of wild rat trapping. The county also organized 106 local gun teams, and more than 900 local guns were dispatched to hunt sparrows. The masses created and used more than 120 kinds of tools for eliminating the four pests, and discovered more than 20 kinds of wild plants that can eliminate mosquitoes and flies. The county party committee vigorously organized technical promotion, and the health department successively held 32 training classes and exhibitions on eliminating the four pests, systematically introducing the technology; Seven mobile technical promotion stations were formed to go to market towns to set up stalls to sell medicines in the form of stalls, and used the method of "speaking, listening, watching, and doing" to impart technology. According to incomplete statistics in the county, more than 1,000 people were trained in eliminating the four pests, and more than 10,000 people learned to manufacture and use ordinary tools for eliminating the four pests. In accordance with local conditions and using local materials, the county produced more than 140,000 tools of various types for eliminating the four pests, an average of nine per household.

    In Jianning County, the patriotic health campaign is closely integrated with shock and regularity. According to the breeding season of the four pests, the principles of "fighting early, fighting small, and fighting effectively" are grasped, and "more, faster, better, and more economical, and quick decisions" are proposed. In the spring of last year, combined with the seasons, four battles were launched: New Year's Day, Spring Festival, Vernal Equinox, and Qingming Festival. More than 20 large-scale sweeps were carried out. The county also unified the time and adopted tactics such as digging, poisoning, and bombing to carry out a large-scale rat and sparrow encirclement and suppression. More than 16,000 households universally carried out one to two rat poisonings. After the end of April, different requirements were put forward at different times, and four large-scale shock campaigns and three county-wide competitions were carried out successively by adopting the method of shock - regular - shock. The "five major measures" were promoted: everyone has a fly swatter, every household has a spittoon, overturning pots and cans, eliminating weeds, and clearing ditches; "Seven major reforms" were carried out: reforming pigsties, cattle pens, chicken and duck coops, toilets, polluted ditches, kitchens, and dead corners. Diseases were investigated and treated in stages. The county also adopted many measures to keep the hygiene work regularized. One is to establish a sanitation system for land parcel contracting, inserting cards to determine the people. Environmental sanitation generally adopts the method of dividing sections and inserting cards to determine the person in charge, street sanitation is responsible for daily duty in rotation, indoor sanitation is also swept every day and swept every five days, and some methods are also formulated for eliminating the four pests and personal hygiene. One is to conduct regular inspections and evaluations, carry out mobile red flag competitions, villages cross each other, and teams inspect each other. Women and children organizations in various townships persuade teams to check the implementation of the sanitation system and help households lacking labor to carry out sanitation.

    In this mountainous area, under the leadership of the Party, the people take action and carry out the results of the patriotic health campaign. The sanitary conditions have been completely renewed, and agriculture and industry have also achieved great increases in production. Hygiene and production promote each other. Now, the county party committee has made new plans to continue to carry out the movement, and strive to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, eliminate diseases, change customs, and transform urban and rural areas.

    除四害　讲卫生　改变了山区面貌
    ——介绍福建省建宁县的爱国卫生运动
    闻化
    在全国爱国卫生运动展览会上，有一组展品和一部电影纪录片，介绍福建省建宁县除四害讲卫生以后出现的新气象。这个县位在闽西山区，从前生活苦，卫生差，疾病流行，因蚊子而引起的疟疾有什么三月青草瘴，四月黄竹瘴，五月荷花瘴，九月桂花瘴等，当时流传的民谣说：“小病把命挨，大病买棺材。”从解放后，1952年起开展全民性爱国卫生运动，1958年掀起了运动的高潮，蚊、蝇、鼠、雀等“四害”被大量消灭了，全县卫生面貌焕然一新。有些地方群众开始夏季不用蚊帐。各种疾病发病率都有下降，并已基本消灭了疟疾。
    政治挂帅　书记动手
    建宁县开展爱国卫生运动的经验，首先是克服部分干部当中的右倾保守思想，加强党的领导。
    1958年初开展运动时，有的干部认为山区条件差，生产劳动紧张，开展除四害讲卫生运动的困难很多，主张零敲碎打，缓步前进。县委组织干部学习党的指示，分析了建宁县的有利条件：山区人民都有解除疾病痛苦解放生产力的共同愿望，几年来卫生运动中群众觉悟和卫生水平有了提高，党也已摸索出领导卫生运动一定的经验，统一了干部的思想认识。从县到乡，各级党委都由书记挂帅，紧密结合生产，开展爱国卫生运动。工作中实行“五统一”和“八抓”，“五统一”就是和其它工作一起统一领导、布置、检查、汇报、总结，“八抓”就是抓规划、重点、安排、典型、先进、观摩、季节等。改变了过去卫生部门孤军作战的局面，组织各部门积极配合，协同作战。共青团把除四害讲卫生作为整团内容之一，开展突击手活动；商业运输部门组织货郎担下乡，及时供应除四害讲卫生的工具和物资；民校上卫生课；中小学、剧团、文化馆、有线广播、电影队、县报、科普等都在党的统一领导下开展宣传活动。
    县委采取抓两头带中间的领导方法，直接掌握溪口镇作典型，创造经验，在春季突击运动中组织各乡到溪口观摩两次，开现场评比会议一次，在全县掀起“学溪口，赶溪口”的热潮。又由县、区机关和卫生部门的部分干部，分别掌握十个重点镇，以点带面，推动全县运动的开展。
    在运动中，领导干部亲自动手，和群众一起战斗，有三个书记分别在水南、溪口搞猪栏大改革试点；第一书记王英贤参加野生植物灭蝇蚊效能的试验，书记秦继耀亲自检查城关卫生，和居民一起打扫街道，半夜随着突击队搜捕麻雀；许多县、区、乡干部参加卫生促进队，帮助烈军属搞卫生，有些区、乡领导干部还成了除四害的能手。领导干部动手，大大地推动了运动的发展。
    卫生运动为生产服务
    1958年，建宁县密切结合生产开展爱国卫生运动。
    县委把除四害讲卫生工作列为各项生产规划和评比内容之一，各级党委都实行统一领导，掌握“大忙小干，小忙大干，不忙猛干”和“突击—经常—突击”的原则。在保证生产任务的前提下，注意劳力组织、时间安排和任务排队等问题，充分发挥非主要劳动力在卫生工作中的作用，使生产与卫生两不误。
    运动中，指挥生产的机构也是爱国卫生运动的机构，生产队也是卫生队，农民们上山下田时带着工具，利用休息时间除四害。工作中贯彻了积肥与打扫环境卫生相结合，兴修水利与疏通沟渠相结合，改革畜禽圈窝与积肥基本建设相结合，全县经过一通（沟渠）、二拣（畜粪、果皮）、三净（院子、角落、房屋）、四挖（杂草、沟泥、地板泥、垃圾）、七改革（猪圈、牛栏、鸡鸭舍、厕所、污沟、厨房和死角）、扫八底（床底、缸底、箱底、磨底、桌底、仓底、粪缸底、灶底），十个月中积聚卫生肥一千多万担，支援了农业生产。春季结合兴修水利搞卫生运动，疏通了沟渠八千七百多条。在农忙时，结合生产上的需要开展妇幼保健工作，全县训练了五百多名接生员，建立六十四个农村产院，基本普及了新法接生。训练二千左右教养员，建立三百五十多所农村托儿组织。注意公共食堂的卫生，宣传分食制，在食堂推行“四有”：有卫生值日，碗筷有消毒，有开水和洗手设备，炊事员有口罩及工作衣。在农村普查地方性疾病，按照发病季节及时开展群众性的防治，基本上消灭了疟疾等病。去年9月县委利用夏秋中间一段时间，抓紧了丝虫病的治疗工作，在秋收大忙前正好结束，不但没有影响生产，反而使秋季大忙时增加了出勤率，促进了生产。
    解放思想　发动群众
    在开展除四害讲卫生运动的时候，许多人曾经认为四害都是些小东西，不必“兴师动众”；有的人怕四害除不了，反而耽误生产。也有少数人存有迷信思想，说什么“老鼠是灶王爷的猪”，“打苍蝇会瞎眼”，“疟疾是太平病”等，阻碍运动的发展。
    各级党委针对群众的思想情况进行深入的教育，在全县开展了卫生大辩论。以生产队为单位，划出五至七天时间，辩论了“为什么除四害”、“四害能不能消灭”、“除四害会不会影响生产”、“怎样才能除四害”等问题。搜集四害危害群众的历史材料和事例，用实物展览及现身说法等方式，发动群众回忆、对比、算账，扫清各种思想障碍。溪口镇农民余水生从谷仓里发现死老鼠，解剖开肚中还残存二两谷子，党支部抓住这一事实向群众算老鼠麻雀糟塌粮食的账。均口区党组织领导群众算了六笔账：消灭四害减少疾病的账，老鼠破坏农具、家具、衣物账，鼠雀损耗粮食账，搞好卫生积肥增产账，田鼠钻洞、危害水利建设账，迷信求佛拜神的开支账。群众经过算账对比大吃一惊，说：“鼓不打不响，账不算不亮，不灭四害，决不收兵。”
    同时开展卫生宣传，全县召开了大型的广播大会、行动大会等十多次，乡、社、生产队也层层召开各种类型的会议，运用山歌、快板、顺口溜等形式，宣传除四害讲卫生。据不完全统计，全县组织卫生文艺宣传一百五十五次，现场观摩五十五次，放映有关卫生的幻灯、电影一百九十八场，编印“八害图”、“除四害山歌”等卫生宣传材料二十九种。黑板报、墙报、土广播、标语、传单等宣传工具，也都动员起来，发挥作用，大字报更成为推动运动的一种有效武器。
    各乡、社、队还广泛组织参观评比和现场会议，群众说：“口说无凭，眼看为真，谁好谁坏，一比分明”。全县的宣传鼓动工作深入人心，98％以上的成年人受到三次到五次的卫生知识教育。省鉴定组在最偏僻的大岭村访问了二十一个老人和儿童，有十九个人能讲出除四害讲卫生的意义。
    群众发动起来，全县组成了青年突击队、少年劝导队、土枪队等各种组织一千二百四十多个。队员们都利用生产和学习空隙，参加卫生运动，城关、溪口镇的青年突击队员，把梯子架在船上，爬到几丈高的城墙上去挖草根。贤河乡二十多个五保户也组织了一个老人队，个个积极参加搞卫生。在除四害讲卫生运动中，全县涌现出六千多名积极分子和三千多名灭鼠雀能手。全县消灭的老鼠麻雀即有一百七十多万只。
    猛干加巧干　突击又经常
    运动开始时，群众干劲很大，但有两种偏向，一种是把卫生运动看为一阵子大扫除，刷地板，洗家具等，忽视了消灭四害的孳生场所，所谓“斩草不除根，春风吹又生”，表面搞好了，四害却灭不了；一种是单纯依靠药物，形成“消毒再消毒，全靠六六六”，花费人力财力，效果也不大。县委发现后研究，从改善环境卫生来消灭蚊蝇孳生场所，结合大扫除进行药物烟熏，消灭越冬蚊蝇，并着重抓工具，抓经验，发掘群众的创造整理推广。半寮乡创造了一种简便有效的捕田鼠工具“竹弓吊筒”，县委即组织卫生部门研究赶制了一百多个，由水利慰问队携带下乡，结合慰问在水利工地边教边示范，使这一工具迅速推广，十天中全县即制造了四万多个，差不多人手一个，形成捕野鼠的高潮。全县还组织一百零六个土枪队，有九百多支土枪出动打雀。群众创造使用了一百二十多种除四害工具，发现了二十多种能消灭蚊蝇的野生植物。县委又大力组织技术推广，卫生部门先后举办三十二个除四害训练班和展览会，系统地介绍技术；组成七个流动技术推广站，到集镇采取摆摊子卖药物的形式，运用“讲、听、看、做”的方法传授技术。全县不完全统计，训练除四害能手一千多人，使一万多人学会制造、使用普通的除四害工具，因地制宜，就地取材，全县制作各种类型的除四害工具十四万多件，平均每户有九件之多。
    爱国卫生运动在建宁县，突击和经常是密切结合的。根据四害繁殖季节掌握“打早，打小，打了”，提出“多快好省，速战速决”，在去年春季结合节令发起了元旦、春节、春分、清明四个战役，进行了二十多次大扫荡。全县又统一时间，采取掏、毒、轰等战术，进行鼠雀大围剿，一万六千多户普遍进行了一次到二次毒鼠。在4月下旬以后，又在不同时期提出不同的要求，采取突击—经常—突击的办法，陆续开展了四次大规模的突击运动，三次全县性的大评比。推行“五大措施”：人有蝇拍，户有痰盂，翻盆倒罐，铲除杂草，清理沟渠；进行“七大改革”：改革猪圈、牛栏、鸡鸭舍、厕所、污沟、厨房、死角。分期普查并防治疾病。这个县还采取许多措施保持卫生工作经常化。一种是建立地段包干、插牌定人的卫生制度。环境卫生一般采取分段插牌定人包干，街道卫生是分片轮流值日负责，室内也天天小扫五天大扫，除四害和个人卫生也订出了一些办法。一种是定期检查评比，开展流动红旗竞赛，村村交叉，队队互查。各乡妇女儿童组织劝导队，检查卫生制度执行情况，并帮助缺乏劳动力的住户搞卫生。
    这个山区地方，在党的领导下全民动手，开展爱国卫生运动的结果，卫生面貌焕然一新，农业、工业也都得到大的增产，卫生与生产互相促进。现在，县委已作出新的规划，继续开展运动，为除尽四害，讲求卫生，消灭疾病，移风易俗，改造城乡而奋斗。
