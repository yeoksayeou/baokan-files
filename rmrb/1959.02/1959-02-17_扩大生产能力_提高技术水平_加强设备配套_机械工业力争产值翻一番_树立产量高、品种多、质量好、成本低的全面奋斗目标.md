Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Under the situation of taking steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward, China's machinery industry will continue to advance at a faster pace this year. Last year, the output value of China's machinery industry increased by more than 80% compared with the previous year. This year, in order to ensure that steel production reaches 18 million tons, according to the preliminary plan of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the output value of the machinery industry will increase by more than double compared with last year, and the output of power station equipment, rolling equipment, mining equipment, agricultural machinery, transportation equipment, petroleum equipment, and chemical equipment will increase several times.

How to ensure a greater leap forward in the machinery industry this year?

The First Ministry of Machine Building believes that it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and do everything possible to expand the production capacity of the machinery industry; it is necessary to make breakthroughs in cutting-edge technology, expand the variety of products, and improve product quality, raising the technical level of the machinery industry to a new stage; it is necessary to strengthen equipment matching to ensure that various mechanical equipment is put into production in a timely and complete manner.

Taking measures to increase the "output per unit area" of existing large enterprises is the fastest and most realistic way to increase production capacity. Therefore, the First Ministry of Machine Building requires existing large enterprises to continue to mobilize the masses, carry out technological revolution, especially to summarize and promote some technical experiences that can greatly increase production, so that the production capacity of these enterprises will first increase rapidly. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the vast number of workers in China's machinery industry created a series of major technical experiences. For example, in cold processing, the "ants gnawing at bones" processing method of using small machine tools to do big jobs, the "teapot boiling pig's head" operating experience of loading more and refining faster in electric furnaces, the experience of "turning large into small, piecing small into large" centered on electroslag welding to solve the shortage of large forgings, and the experience of "replacing steel with iron and forgings with castings" centered on the promotion and use of ductile iron, played a great role in solving the difficulties of insufficient large processing equipment and large castings and forgings, enabling many factories that could only produce small products to manufacture a large number of various heavy equipment. These important experiences will be vigorously promoted this year. Insufficient supply of large blanks is the main key hindering the rapid growth of the production capacity of the machinery industry. In response to this weak link, a series of advanced technologies and high-efficiency process methods that can increase production will also be promoted and adopted in casting and forging this year. In addition, this year, the machinery industry departments in various places will widely adopt non-cutting processing methods such as punching, pressing, extrusion, drawing, rolling, precision casting, and precision forging to replace some cutting processing; in some enterprises, simple automatic and semi-automatic production lines will also be developed where possible. By promoting and adopting these advanced experiences, the production capacity of existing large enterprises will be greatly improved.

In order for the machinery industry to achieve a large-scale harvest, in addition to striving to increase the production capacity of large enterprises, it is also necessary to continue to implement the policy of giving equal importance to large, medium, and small enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Mobilizing the masses to carry out the small indigenous groups movement of the machinery industry in urban and rural people's communes is an indispensable auxiliary force to assist large enterprises in increasing production, and it is also the main force for developing small-scale iron and steel, coal, petroleum, electricity, chemical, building materials, light industry, and transportation industries. The First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to further grasp and improve the small indigenous groups movement of the machinery industry this year, provide technical assistance, and continuously help them consolidate and improve. In order to systematically exchange and promote the equipment and processes created by the masses in various places in 1958, the First Ministry of Machine Building is preparing to organize a "National Exhibition of Indigenous Equipment and Indigenous Methods in the Machinery Industry."

In order to complete such arduous production tasks in the machinery industry, it is also necessary to strengthen capital construction and increase production capacity. This year's capital construction arrangements in the machinery industry first ensure the growth of metallurgy and power station equipment. These two types of projects, plus the supporting projects they require, account for the majority of this year's total capital construction investment. In order to speed up the progress of capital construction and put new capacity into production as soon as possible, the First Ministry of Machine Building first focused on the expansion projects of old factories when arranging this year's construction projects. Heavy machinery factories, power generation equipment factories, etc., which have already been expanded last year, will be accelerated to be completed and put into production. Some newly built factories that are nearing completion, such as tractor factories and petroleum machinery factories, will also be equipped and put into production as soon as possible.

The First Ministry of Machine Building believes that while increasing the "output per unit area," each enterprise must also emphasize increasing product variety, improving quality, and reducing costs. The requirements of these four aspects should be combined as the overall goal of a greater leap forward in the machinery industry in 1959. (Attached pictures)

    扩大生产能力　提高技术水平　加强设备配套
    机械工业力争产值翻一番
    树立产量高、品种多、质量好、成本低的全面奋斗目标
    新华社16日讯　我国机械工业在以钢为纲，全面跃进的形势下，今年将以更快的速度继续前进。去年，我国机械工业的产值比前年增长了80％以上，今年，为了确保钢产量达到一千八百万吨，根据第一机械工业部的初步计划，机械工业的产值将比去年增长一倍以上，而电站设备、轧钢设备、矿山设备、农业机械、交通运输设备、石油设备和化工设备的产量，都将成倍甚至几倍地增长。
    如何保证实现今年机械工业的更大跃进呢？
    第一机械工业部认为，必须继续贯彻两条腿走路的方针，千方百计地扩大机械工业的生产能力；必须突击尖端技术、扩大品种、提高产品质量，把机械工业的技术水平提高到新的阶段；必须加强设备配套工作，使各种机械设备及时成套地投入生产。
    采取措施努力提高现有大企业的“单位面积产量”，是提高生产能力最快、最现实的办法。因此第一机械工业部要求现有大企业继续放手发动群众，开展技术革命，特别是总结和推广一些能够大量增产的技术经验，使这些企业的生产能力首先迅速增长上去。在1958年的大跃进中，我国机械工业广大职工曾经创造了一系列的重大技术经验。例如在冷加工方面利用小机床干大活的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法、让电炉多装快炼的“茶壶煮猪头”的操作经验、以电渣焊为中心的“化大为小、拼小成大”解决大锻件不足的经验、以推广使用球墨铸铁为中心的“以铁代钢、以铸代锻”等经验，对于解决大型加工设备不够和大型铸锻件不足的困难，起了很大作用，使许多原来只能生产小型产品的工厂制造出了大量的各种重型设备。这些重要经验今年都将大力推广，大件毛坯供应不足，是阻碍机械工业生产能力迅速增长的主要关键。针对这一薄弱环节，今年在铸造、锻造方面也将推广和采用一系列可以提高产量的先进技术和高效率的工艺方法。此外，今年各地机械工业部门还将广泛采用冲、压、挤、拔、轧和精密铸造、精密锻造等不用切削的加工方法，来代替部分切削加工；在某些企业中，还将根据可能发展一些简易自动、半自动生产线等。通过推广和采用这些先进经验，现有大企业的生产能力就将大大提高一步。
    机械工业要取得大面积丰收，除了努力提高大企业的生产能力以外，还必须继续贯彻大中小企业并举、土洋结合的方针。发动群众开展城市和农村人民公社的机械工业的小土群运动，是协助大企业提高产量的不可缺少的辅助力量，同时也是发展小型钢铁、煤炭、石油、电力、化工、建筑材料、轻工等工业和交通运输业的主要力量。第一机械工业部决定今年进一步抓紧抓好机械工业的小土群运动，在技术上给予援助，不断帮助它们巩固和提高。为了系统地交流和推广1958年各地群众创造的设备和工艺，第一机械工业部正在筹办一个“全国机械工业土设备土办法展览会”。
    为了完成机械工业这样艰巨的生产任务，还必须加强基本建设，增加生产能力。今年机械工业的基本建设的安排首先保证了冶金、电站设备的增长。这两类项目加上它们所需的配套项目，就占了今年全部基本建设投资的大部分。为了加快基本建设施工进度，让新增能力尽快投入生产，第一机械工业部在安排今年的施工项目时，首先抓紧了老厂的扩建工程。去年已经进行扩建的重型机械工厂、发电设备工厂等，将要加速建成，投入生产。一些正在收尾的新建工厂如拖拉机厂、石油机械厂等，也将尽快装备起来投入生产。
    第一机械工业部认为，每个企业在提高“单位面积产量”的同时，还必须强调增加产品品种，提高质量和降低成本。要把这四方面的要求结合起来，作为1959年机械工业更大跃进的全面奋斗目标。（附图片）
