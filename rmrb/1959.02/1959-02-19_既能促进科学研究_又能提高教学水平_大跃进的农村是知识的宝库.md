    Can Both Promote Scientific Research and Improve Teaching Level:
    The Great Leap Forward's Countryside is a Treasure Trove of Knowledge
    Beijing Agricultural University Teachers and Students' Immersion in the Countryside Yields Huge Gains
    (Our Newspaper's Report) More than two thousand teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University, with the exception of a small number remaining at the university to run factories, were dispatched to eleven brigades in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Ningxia, and the outskirts of Beijing in early September last year. During the first three months of their time in the countryside, the teachers and students earnestly ate and lived with the peasants, participated in various agricultural production tasks, initially established a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint, and also learned various operational techniques in agricultural production, gaining new perspectives on agricultural production. Professor Li Jingxiong of the Agronomy Department, before being sent to the countryside, even believed that nothing could be learned from the peasants; after being sent down, he was stumped when the commune members asked him to explain the knowledge of deep plowing. The book knowledge of the past could rarely solve the specific problems raised by the peasants. Later, he also participated in the Shandong Province Wheat Production Technology Symposium, where he heard even more fresh experiences. The facts changed his perception of the peasants. The experience of the Red Flag People's Commune in Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, producing nearly 30,000 catties of grapes per mu, the experience of Shanxi Yanbei adopting mass mobilization methods to prevent and control potato late blight, and the experience of Yang Laoda Niang of the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan, raising pigs, etc., were news that teachers and students had never heard before. The teachers and students deeply felt that the Great Leap Forward's countryside is a rich treasure trove of knowledge, opening up broad avenues for teachers and students to conduct scientific research and improve teaching standards.
    During their time in the countryside, the teachers and students also used their book knowledge to assist local communes in running dozens of factories and schools. The teachers and students of the Qinghai Brigade assisted the herdsmen in establishing more than twenty livestock product processing plants, building material factories, and fertilizer processing plants, providing experience for running industry for herdsmen on plateaus more than 3,000 meters above sea level. The Hebei and Shanxi Brigades also assisted farmers in their localities in establishing agricultural science research institutes. Teachers and students from other major brigades also generally carried out soil surveys, prevented and controlled plant diseases and insect pests, and treated livestock diseases. Since November last year, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Agricultural University, the teachers and students of each dispatched brigade have further strengthened the reform of teaching and scientific research. Most teams have summarized the advanced experiences of local production experts and written more than two hundred articles. After summarizing the rich harvest experiences of the peasants, the teachers and students of the Agronomy and Horticulture Departments, together with the local peasants, planted experimental fields. Professor Cai Xu of the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan, Professor Sun Qu of the Xiong Huo People's Commune in Hongdong County, Shanxi, Professor Li Jingxiong of the People's Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong, and Professor Shen Qiyi of the Shang Zhuang People's Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, all planted wheat experimental fields with local experienced farmers, and the wheat seedlings grew as well as expected. The professors all believed that the significant difference between this type of experimental field and the experimental fields they had done on campus in the past was that it summarized and elevated the advanced experience of the peasants to theory, which was then used to guide the experiment.
    Recently, after the teachers of each dispatched team returned to the school, they summarized the gains of the previous five months in the countryside and specifically discussed how to better combine labor, teaching reform, and scientific research during the time in the countryside. The students' labor should be combined with their majors as much as possible, and the dispatched organization was adjusted according to the needs of the entire teaching program. In addition to teaching work, the teachers also put more time into scientific research work. At the meeting, the teachers of each major brigade expressed their desire to make greater achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. (Attached picture)

    既能促进科学研究　又能提高教学水平  
    大跃进的农村是知识的宝库
    北京农业大学师生下放农村收获巨大
    本报讯　北京农业大学师生下放农村五个月获得了很大成绩，为改革教学、科学研究打下了良好的基础。
    北京农业大学的二千多师生除一小部分留校办厂以外，于去年9月初，分十一个大队下放到河南、河北、山东、山西、内蒙古、青海、宁夏等七省、区和北京市郊区。下放的头三个月中，师生们都认真地和农民同吃同住，参加了农业上的各种生产劳动，初步地树立了劳动观点和群众观点，也学到了一些农业生产上的各种操作技术，对农业生产有了新的看法。农学系李竞雄教授，下放前还认为向农民学不到什么东西；下放后，社员请他讲深耕地的学问时，他为难了。过去的书本知识，很少能解决农民所提出的具体问题。后来他又参加了山东省的小麦生产技术座谈会，在会上，他听到的新鲜经验更多了。事实使他改变了对农民的看法。山西省清徐县红旗人民公社每亩产葡萄近三万斤、山西雁北采用群众运动办法防治马铃薯晚疫病的经验，以及河南遂平县卫星人民公社杨老大娘养猪的经验等等，更是师生们过去从未听到过的新闻。师生们深切地感到了大跃进的农村是丰富的知识宝库，为师生进行科学研究，提高教学水平开辟了广阔的道路。
    师生们在下放期间，也运用书本知识协助当地公社举办了几十座工厂和学校。青海大队的师生协助牧民们所办起的二十多个畜产品加工厂、建筑材料厂、肥料加工厂，为拔海三千多公尺高原上的牧民办工业提供了经验。河北、山西等大队，也协助所在地的农民举办了农业科学研究所。其他各大队的师生也普遍进行了土壤调查，防治病虫害，为牲畜医治疾病等活动。去年11月以来，各下放大队的师生在农业大学党委的领导下，进一步加强了改革教学和科学研究工作，多数队都总结了当地生产能手的先进经验，写出了二百多篇文章。农学系、园艺系的师生，在总结了农民的丰产经验后，又和当地农民一起种了试验田。在河南遂平县卫星人民公社的蔡旭教授、在山西洪洞县雄火人民公社的孙渠教授、在山东寿张县人民公社的李竞雄教授、在河北省徐水县商庄人民公社的沈其益教授，都和当地老农一起种了小麦试验田，麦苗都长的和预想的一样好。教授们都认为这种试验田，比自己过去在校内搞的试验田的显著不同点，是把农民中的先进经验总结上升为理论，在理论的指导下进行的。
    最近各个下放队的教师回到学校后，总结了前五个月的下放收获，并具体地讨论了在下放期间，如何把劳动、改革教学和科学研究更好地结合起来的问题。学生的劳动尽可能和所学的专业相结合，根据整个教学需要调整了下放组织。教师们除了进行教学工作外，也把更多的时间放在科学研究工作上。会上各大队的教师都表示要做出更大成绩，来迎接国庆十周年。（附图片）
