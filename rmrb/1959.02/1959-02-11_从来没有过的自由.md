    Freedom Never Before Experienced
    Farmers don't have to worry about food, which is something I never dreamed of. Thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party, we have finally begun to live a carefree and free life. Some Americans say "communes are not free." I don't know what freedom they are talking about. Freedom to exploit people? Freedom to loaf around? Putting aside everything else, in the old society, we couldn't even get enough to eat when we were hungry. *That* was true unfreedom. Now, as long as we work hard and produce, we don't have to worry about food or clothing. We won't suffer when we get old, and our children and grandchildren will have a happy future. In the past, we would never have dared to imagine having such a comfortable, free, and happy life as we have today.
  (Chen Shuiguan, member of the Gaishan Commune, Fuzhou)

    从来没有过的自由
    农民吃饭不用愁，这真是做梦也没想到的事。感谢共产党的好领导，我们才算开始过着无忧无虑的自由生活。美国有人说“办了公社不自由”。我不知道他们说的是什么自由。剥削人的自由吗？闲趟过日的自由吗？不说别的，在旧社会里，我们肚子饿了，要吃饱饭也办不到，这才真不自由哩。现在我们人人只要努力干，努力生产，吃的穿的不要你发愁，年老也不苦，子孙也都有幸福的前途。过去我们那里敢想有今天这样舒畅、自由、幸福的日子过。
