Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 26th. TASS Washington, February 25th: At U.S. President Eisenhower's press conference on the 25th, someone asked him whether, in view of Khrushchev's speech in the Kalinin constituency in Moscow, he would agree to convene a summit conference. Eisenhower replied that Khrushchev's speech was made when British Prime Minister Macmillan was visiting Moscow to create a favorable atmosphere for negotiations between the West and the Soviet Union. This speech merely re-emphasizes Khrushchev's uncompromising attitude and does not help create such an atmosphere. Eisenhower added that the only logical position for the United States is to not budge an inch on the Berlin issue, and the United States cannot negotiate with the Soviet Union on the West's "rights" in West Berlin.

Eisenhower said that world public opinion places great hope on a summit conference, and if the conference fails, it will only increase the world's pessimism. He said that the United States agreed to hold the Geneva summit conference in 1955, and it hoped at the time that the real test of such a conference would come from concrete negotiations, especially concrete negotiations at the foreign minister level. He said that it would be a big mistake to hold a top-level meeting without making preparations to give the meeting a hope of success.

Eisenhower made it clear that he does not approve of the signing of a non-aggression treaty between Britain and the Soviet Union. He said that Dulles and he have always believed that countries participating in the United Nations have already assumed the obligation of non-aggression. If there were an atmosphere of trust and one could believe that treaty signatories would not break their faith, the United States would not be very opposed to signing such a treaty. But without confidence based on mutual control, such a treaty would be worthless. It is believed here that Eisenhower's words are advising Macmillan not to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union.

A reporter asked how Western countries intend to "defend" their "rights" in West Berlin, but the president did not directly answer the question. But he said that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have such secret plans. He said that America's allies fully agree with America's view that a firm Western attitude on the Berlin issue is absolutely essential.

A reporter asked if Western troops were stopped on their way to West Berlin, would the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty be invoked. Eisenhower said he hadn't thought of that.

A reporter asked Eisenhower to talk about the possibility of reaching an agreement at the current Geneva conference. He said, honestly, the U.S. government no longer has as much hope for the success of the talks as it did in the past.

In answering a question, the President said that he and Macmillan had not reached a specific agreement on the British Prime Minister's subsequent visit to Washington to meet with the U.S. President, although Macmillan believed when he left for Moscow, he would probably visit several Western capitals (including Washington) on his way home in order to report on his talks with Khrushchev.

### 艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上表示  美国不愿举行首脑会议  反对英苏签订互不侵犯条约

    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上表示
    美国不愿举行首脑会议
    反对英苏签订互不侵犯条约
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿25日讯：在美国总统艾森豪威尔25日的记者招待会上，有人问他鉴于赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科加里宁选区发表的演说，他是否同意召开政府首脑会议。艾森豪威尔回答说，赫鲁晓夫的演说是在英国首相麦克米伦到莫斯科访问为西方和苏联之间的谈判创造有利气氛的时候发表的，这个演说只不过再次强调说明赫鲁晓夫的不妥协态度，它无助于创造这样一种气氛。艾森豪威尔又说，美国唯一合乎逻辑的立场是在柏林问题上寸步不让，美国不可能同苏联谈判西方在西柏林的“权利”。
    艾森豪威尔说，世界舆论对政府首脑会议寄予了极大的希望，如果会议失败，它只会增加世界的悲观情绪。他说，美国在1955年曾经同意召开日内瓦政府首脑会议，它当时希望这种会议的真正考验将来自具体谈判，特别是外长级的具体谈判。他说，如果不作使会议有取得成功的希望的准备工作就举行最高级会议，那将是一个很大的错误。
    艾森豪威尔表明，他不赞成英苏两国签订互不侵犯条约。他说，杜勒斯和他一向认为，参加联合国的国家已经承担了互不侵犯的义务。如果存在着信任的气氛，能够相信条约签字国不会背信弃义，美国本不会非常反对签订这种条约。但是如果没有建立在相互控制的基础上的信心，这种条约将是没有价值的。这里认为艾森豪威尔这些话是劝告麦克米伦不要同苏联签订条约。
    有记者问到西方国家打算怎样来“保卫”它们在西柏林的“权利”，总统没有直接回答这个问题。但是他说，北大西洋公约组织成员国有这样的秘密计划。他说，美国的盟国完全同意美国的这种看法：西方在柏林问题上的坚决态度是绝对不可少的。
    有记者问如果西方军队在赴西柏林途中受到阻止，是否会引用北大西洋公约组织条约的条文，艾森豪威尔说，他没有想到这一点。
    有记者要求艾森豪威尔谈谈目前在日内瓦会议上达成协议的可能性。他说，老实说，美国政府已没有像过去那样对会谈成功抱有希望。
    总统在答复一个问题的时候说，他和麦克米伦并没有就英国首相随后访问华盛顿同美国总统会面的问题达成具体协议，虽然麦克米伦在动身前往莫斯科的时候认为他大概要在返国途中访问几个西方国家首都（包括华盛顿在内），以便报告他同赫鲁晓夫会谈的情况。
