Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 20th: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station announced on the evening of the 19th the battle achievements of the Algerian National Liberation Army over the past six months, pointing out that France's oil transportation lines in southern Algeria had been severely damaged, and the French colonial army had suffered repeated disastrous defeats. The Algerian National Liberation Army has grown increasingly strong, and the French cannot win this disastrous colonial war. The only solution to the Algerian problem is to immediately hold equal peace talks with the Algerian Provisional Government.

The radio station said that five days ago, a French train transporting oil was attacked by the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army and completely destroyed. Over 40 French soldiers escorting the train were killed or wounded, and a helicopter was shot down.

The radio station announced that from July 1 to December 31, 1958, the Algerian National Liberation Army attacked French oil trains 52 times, blowing up 48 of them, and destroying 12 railway facilities and water towers of great military value. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,500 French soldiers were killed and 2,000 wounded.

The radio station said that a captured French secret document admitted that the Algerian National Liberation Army's "repeated attacks on the oil transportation lines not only seriously affected the security of the region but also caused economic losses amounting to hundreds of millions." The French concentrated about 100,000 troops to protect the railway lines, and built thousands of bunkers, laid minefields and barbed wire. However, a French prisoner of war confessed: "The money spent on protecting this transportation line is more than buying foreign oil."

The radio station pointed out that De Gaulle desperately wanted to transport the oil out, mainly for political purposes. He wanted to use this to carry out deceptive activities in France, demanding that the French people pay more money and blood for the so-called oil, and wanted to attract Western oil trusts to jointly plunder Algeria's wealth, thereby internationalizing the Algerian problem. De Gaulle also hoped to deceive the French people, making them believe that military operations had been reduced to a very small scale. However, the heroic achievements of the Algerian National Liberation Army have made all these his "daydreams."

The radio station said that the Algerian Provisional Government reiterated: We will absolutely not allow the French to unilaterally plunder Algeria's wealth.

The Algerian Provisional Government officially announced that all agreements unilaterally signed by foreign oil companies with France to plunder Algeria's oil wealth are illegal.

    阿尔及利亚人民愈战愈强
    半年来毙伤法国殖民军三千五百多人
    新华社开罗20日电　阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台19日晚间在宣布阿尔及利亚民族解放军半年来的战绩时指出，法国在阿尔及利亚南部的石油运输线遭到了严重破坏，法国殖民军队连遭惨败，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经日益强大，法国人无法在这场灾难性的殖民战争中获胜，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一办法就是立即同阿尔及利亚临时政府举行平等的和平谈判。
    电台说，五天前，一列运送石油的法国列车受到英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的袭击而被全部击毁。押运的一连法国军队被杀伤四十多人，一架直升飞机被击落。
    电台宣布，从1958年7月1日到12月底的半年中，阿尔及利亚民族解放军共袭击法国的石油列车五十二次，炸了四十八列，并且破坏了具有很重大军事价值的铁路设备和水塔共十二处。据不完全统计，共击毙法军一千五百多人，击伤两千人。
    电台说，被缴获的一份法方的密件承认，阿尔及利亚民族解放军“对石油运输线的一再袭击，不仅严重影响这一地区的安全，而且造成了数以亿计的经济损失”。法国人集中了十万左右的军队来保护铁路线，并且修建了上千座堡垒，布置了地雷阵和铁丝网。但是，一个法国兵俘虏供称：“保护这条运输线所花的钱比买外国石油还多。”
    电台指出，戴高乐拼命想把石油运出去，更主要是为了政治上的目的。他想以此在法国进行欺骗活动，要求法国人民为所谓石油而付出更多的金钱和鲜血，并想吸引各西方大石油托辣斯共同掠夺阿尔及利亚的财富，从而把阿尔及利亚问题国际化。戴高乐还希望欺骗法国人民，使他们相信军事行动已经缩小到很小的程度。但是，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的英勇战绩使他这些都成为“空想”。
    电台说，阿尔及利亚临时政府再次声明：法国人想片面地掠夺阿尔及利亚的财富，这是我们绝对不容许的。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府正式宣布：一切外国石油公司同法国片面签订的掠夺阿尔及利亚石油财富的协定都是非法的。
