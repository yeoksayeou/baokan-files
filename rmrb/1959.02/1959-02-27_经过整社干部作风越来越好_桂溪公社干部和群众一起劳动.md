After the rectification of the commune, the work style of the cadres in Guixi People's Commune, Huayang County, Sichuan, has been further improved. The cadres who had good work and style before are even better than before; the individual cadres who had shortcomings in the past were criticized by the masses during the rectification and immediately corrected their shortcomings. Now, the cadres are going deep among the masses, taking the lead in production, caring about the lives of the commune members, and consulting with the masses in everything. Therefore, many commune and team cadres have been praised by the commune members.

Since the rectification of the commune, Liu Bangji, the secretary of the Guangrong Management District Party Branch, has participated in production every day for a month, except for three days of attending meetings outside, and he has always picked the heaviest and dirtiest work to do. For example, some commune members disliked the dirty and tiring work of carrying manure and urine and were unwilling to do it, so he took the lead in carrying manure and urine, and under his leadership, the task of fertilizing wheat was completed ahead of schedule. Li Shuying, a member of the commune party committee, participated in less production in the past; after being criticized by the masses, she immediately moved to the Hongguang Management District, and ate, lived, and worked with the commune members. No matter how busy she was with work, she always insisted on taking half of her working time to participate in labor production. The masses responded very well, saying that she was really a good cadre of the Communist Party, and that she changed as soon as she was told. Of the seventeen cadres at the commune level, only one secretary and one financial administrator are now regularly in the office, and the rest have gone deep to participate in production or engage in various experimental fields.

Now, the cadres at all levels in this commune can not only go to the fields to work regularly, but also visit the commune members' homes in their spare time to understand the situation, and discover and solve various problems that occur in the production and life of the commune members in a timely manner. Li Wanqi, a commune member of Shiqiang Management District, burned his quilt, and Li Guocai, the production team leader, lent him his own quilt that night. As soon as Liang Xizhong, the secretary of the Heping Management District branch, heard that Chen Shaoqing, a commune member, was ill, he went to express his sympathy and helped him invite a doctor and buy medicine.

    经过整社干部作风越来越好
    桂溪公社干部和群众一起劳动
    本报讯　四川华阳县桂溪人民公社自整社以来，干部作风有了进一步的改进，原来工作好、作风好的干部，比以前越发好了；原来个别有缺点的干部，在整社中受到群众批评，也都立即改掉了缺点。现在是干部个个深入群众，带头生产，关心社员生活，遇事和群众商量。因此，很多社队干部得到社员赞扬。
    光荣管理区党支部书记刘邦畿，自整社以来的一个月中，除在外参加了三天会议以外，天天都参加生产，而且拣最重最脏的活干。如有些社员嫌挑粪担尿的活脏、累，不愿干，他就带头担粪挑尿，在他的带动下提前完成了浇麦施肥任务。公社党委委员李淑英过去参加生产少；受到群众批评后，立即搬到红光管理区，与社员同吃同住同劳动，无论工作怎样忙，她总坚持拿一半工作时间参加劳动生产，群众反映很好，说她真是共产党的好干部，说变就变。公社一级的十七个干部，现在经常在办公室的只有一个秘书和一个财务管理员，其余的都深入下去参加了生产或搞各种试验田。
    现在这个公社的各级干部，不仅能经常下地劳动，而且一有空闲就到社员家里进行访问，了解情况，及时发现和解决社员在生产和生活中发生的各种问题。石强管理区社员李万启，烧了被子，生产队长李国才当晚就把自己的被子借给他盖。和平管理区支部书记梁锡忠，一听说社员陈绍清生病了，就去慰问，帮他请医生、买药。
