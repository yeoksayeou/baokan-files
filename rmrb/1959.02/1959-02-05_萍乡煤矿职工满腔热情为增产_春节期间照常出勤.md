Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd. The workers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, have decided to guarantee normal attendance during the Spring Festival in order to mine more coking coal for the iron and steel marshal. To this end, all the mine workers are currently making active use of their spare time from tense production to rehearse entertainment programs, preparing to spend a lively Spring Festival in the mine.

　　This year's production and construction of the Pingxiang Coal Mine will have a greater leap forward than last year. All the mine workers are greatly encouraged by this and are confidently guaranteeing the realization of this year's leap forward targets. They believe that "a year's plan starts in the spring," and only by excellently completing the first quarter's plan can the annual leap forward plan be better guaranteed. Therefore, they have decided to give up the Spring Festival holiday to create a good start for realizing this year's greater leap forward targets.
