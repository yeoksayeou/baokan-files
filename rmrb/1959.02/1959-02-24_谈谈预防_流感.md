Talking About Preventing "Influenza"
    Shi Gong

    Influenza, or flu for short, is an acute infectious disease that affects people's respiratory tracts. It can occur in all seasons, but it is more common during the cold winter and spring months. This disease is very contagious and therefore has a significant impact. Mild or severe, it affects labor. A mild case causes discomfort for a few days, while a severe case requires bed rest for many days, making it impossible to work. Calculating across the country, its impact on industrial and agricultural production and other socialist construction fronts is quite considerable.

    Influenza is transmitted by the influenza virus. This virus is smaller than bacteria and cannot be seen with ordinary microscopes. However, it exists in large quantities on the nasal and throat mucous membranes of patients. When patients cough, talk, sneeze, or spit, they can spread the virus along with nasal discharge, phlegm, and saliva. People with weak resistance can get the disease after inhaling the virus. Eating utensils used by patients, such as teacups, bowls, chopsticks, towels, and food, can also transmit the virus.

    This disease is highly contagious and spreads quickly, easily causing epidemics. Direct or indirect contact with patients can lead to infection. People who get the disease, regardless of gender or age, suffer greatly, experiencing fever, headache, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, and sometimes red eyes, photophobia, and tearing. It is often accompanied by a irritating cough and a feeling of pressure behind the sternum. Most patients do not want to eat. In the early stages of the disease, they first experience chills and shivering, followed by a fever reaching 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. Patients feel very weak and tired, with soreness in the lower back and legs, and just want to lie in bed. The above symptoms usually subside in three to five days, at which point special care must be taken. Especially for weak patients or children, the respiratory tract resistance is very weak at this time, making them susceptible to infection by other bacteria and other infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, laryngitis, purulent otitis media, sinusitis, etc. Depending on the type of complications, different severe influenza symptoms can arise, with pneumonia being the most important to watch out for. The main symptoms are persistent high fever, difficulty breathing, and worsening cough. Laryngitis mainly manifests as hoarseness and a dry throat. Sinusitis mainly manifests as increased pain in the face and forehead, and high fever. People's communes, factories, mines, construction sites, schools, and government offices have many people in close contact, so if there are influenza patients, the disease can easily spread, and special attention must be paid to prevention.

    How to prevent it?

    1. Pay attention to personal hygiene. Strictly implement personal protection measures and avoid spitting anywhere. Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing. During epidemics, avoid or minimize going to public places and epidemic areas, and avoid taking children to these places as much as possible. If you must go, wear a mask. A mask made of six layers of fine gauze is considered qualified. Wash and change it frequently. After each use, soak it in soapy boiling water for half an hour, then rinse it with clean water and dry it for future use. Strengthen physical exercise, pay attention to diet and daily life, and develop good hygiene habits. Increase or decrease clothing as the weather changes to avoid catching a cold.

    2. Keep the environment clean and tidy. Keep the house ventilated and airy, and sweep and sprinkle water every day. Isolate influenza patients immediately. Boil the patient's drinking utensils, eating utensils, handkerchiefs, and face towels in boiling water to disinfect them, and separate them from healthy people to prevent infection. After healthy people come into contact with patients or their utensils, they should immediately wash their hands with hot soapy water.

    3. Strengthen the management of collective canteens and pay attention to hygienic operating procedures. Conduct hygiene knowledge training for cooks and strictly implement various hygiene regulations. Boil cooking utensils and eating utensils in boiling water after each meal. Pay special attention to the hygiene of food storage. Separate sick people from healthy people during meals.

    4. If suspected patients are found, report them to the Red Cross members or hygiene team leaders on the spot as soon as possible, or directly ask the local doctor to guide isolation and treatment. Pay attention to nursing care during the patient's illness to avoid catching a cold.

    谈谈预防“流感”
    奭公
    流行性感冒，简称流感。这种病是侵犯人们呼吸道的一种急性传染病，一年四季都能发生，冬春两季天气冷的时候，发病人更比较多。这种病很容易传染，因而影响是相当严重的。轻的重的都要影响劳动，轻则几天不舒服，重则卧床多日，无法劳动，全国各地多多少少计算起来，在工农业生产上以及其他社会主义建设战线上来说，它的影响也就可以想见了。
    流行性感冒是由流行性感冒病毒传染的。这种病毒比细菌还小，普通显微镜都不能看到它，可是在病人鼻腔粘膜和咽喉粘膜上，它大量地存在着。当病人咳嗽、谈话、打喷嚏、吐痰时，都能把病毒跟着鼻涕、痰、唾沫散布开来。抵抗力弱的人，吸进病毒以后就能染上这病。病人用过的饮食器具，如茶杯、碗筷、手巾、食物等，也可以传播这种病毒。
    这种病的传染性很强，传布起来很快，容易造成流行。这种病，和病人直接接触或间接接触都能受到传染。得了这种病的人，不问性别、年龄，都很难受，感到发热、头痛、喉痛、周身酸痛、倦怠无力、眼睛有时发红、怕光流泪，往往还伴有刺激性的咳嗽，胸骨有后压的感觉。这样的病人，大多数不想吃东西。得病初期，先恶寒打抖，继之发热达摄氏三十八度到四十度，病人感到非常疲弱无力，同时有腰酸腿痛的感觉，只想在床上躺躺。上述各种症状，一般三天到五天才能下退，这时候要特别当心。特别是体弱的病人或小孩，这时候呼吸道抵抗力很弱，易受别的细菌感染，合并得别的传染病，如肺炎、喉头炎、化脓性中耳炎、副鼻窦炎等等。因合并的疾病种类不同，会引起不同的重症流行性感冒症状，其中以合并肺炎最应注意，主要症状是高热不退，呼吸困难，咳嗽加重。喉头炎主要是声音嘶哑，喉咙发干。鼻窦炎主要是面部额部疼痛加剧、高热。人民公社、厂矿、工地、学校、机关，人多接触多，如果有患了流行性感冒的病人，就很容易散布开来，必须特别注意防止。
    如何预防？
    一、注意个人卫生。严格做好个人防护，不随地吐痰。咳嗽打喷嚏，要用手帕掩蔽口鼻。在流行的时候，不到或少到公共场所以及流行地段，尽可能地不带小孩去这些地方，如果必须去的，要戴上口罩。口罩以用六层细纱布做的为合格，勤洗、勤换，用过一次后，放在肥皂开水里浸上半个钟头，再把它用清水漂净晾干备用。平日要加强锻炼身体，当心饮食起居，养成良好卫生习惯。天气骤变，随时增减衣着，以免着凉。
    二、环境卫生要搞得干干净净，住屋要通风透气，天天洒水打扫。有流感病人，就要立即隔离。病人饮食用具、手帕脸巾等，要用开水煮沸消毒，而且要和健康人分开用，以免传染。健康人接触病人或病人的用具以后，要随即用热水肥皂洗手。
    三、集体食堂要加强管理，注意卫生操作制度。炊事人员要进行卫生常识训练，严格执行各项卫生制度；炊具食具每顿饭后要用开水煮一次。尤其是饮食物的收藏，要特别注意卫生。有病的人要和健康人分开用饭。
    四、发现有疑似的病人，及早就地报告红十字会员或卫生小组长，或者直接请地段医师指导隔离诊治。病人生病期间，要注意护理工作，避免着凉。
