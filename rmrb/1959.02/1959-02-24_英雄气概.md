    Heroic Spirit
    Ma Guozheng
    Not long ago, I heard that Shanghai had produced a new "Hero No. 100" gold pen. This Spring Festival, a comrade went to Shanghai, and I finally asked him to buy one for me. It truly lived up to its name and was something you couldn't put down. Stroking it again and again, I couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion.
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the solemn call to catch up with England in fifteen years, various places have been surging forward with practical actions in response. The employees of the Shanghai Huafu Gold Pen Factory decided to achieve "Hero catching Parker" in a short period. This "Hero No. 100" gold pen is said to be a new product trial-produced to catch up with Parker, and it is now in mass production. This heroic action is truly inspiring. The Shanghai Film Studio specifically made a film: "Hero Catching Parker," which is indeed very worthwhile.
    When I picked up this beautiful, elegant, smooth-writing domestic gold pen, my joy was indescribable. At the same time, I couldn't help but have some "daydreams." I remember when I was just starting elementary school more than ten years ago, until before Liberation, the stationery used by most people was almost all foreign goods. "6B" pencils were from the German company Steadtler, "6H" "4H"... were from the American brand Eagle, pencil sharpeners were "Made in Germany," ink was "Waterman" or "Parker," compasses and instruments... almost all had foreign trademarks. Gold pens were even more so, with "Eversharp," "Parker 51"... flooding the market. Although there were better domestic pens at that time, such as Golden Star, Xinmin, and Hero, these national industries simply could not achieve good development before Liberation, let alone compete with foreign goods; it seemed that "Parker 51" would always be a famous brand, and no one else could catch up, let alone think of competing with it. Over time, a superstitious mentality formed among some people. Even after Liberation, this superstitious mentality had not been completely eliminated.
    The Party's great call to "Surpass England" roared across the land like spring thunder, awakening countless heroic sons and daughters to rise up, strive forward, and catch up quickly. In what seemed like no time at all, we not only achieved the grand task of doubling steel production at a speed never seen in any capitalist country, but also witnessed a moving scene of "one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping" on the industrial front. We also have domestically produced cars, airplanes, ships, atomic reactors, electronic computers, giant generators... and we also have the "Hero No. 100."
    Naturally, we will never be satisfied with our existing achievements. This year, we will continue to whip our horses and move forward. Now, the facts have provided the best proof. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, especially the heroic spirit and heroic creations of the 600 million people, have given a great lesson to those with superstitious ideas, allowing them to clear their minds, stand up straight, catch up, and contribute their share to the greater leap forward of the motherland.

    英雄气概
    马国征
    不久以前，听说上海新出了一种“英雄100号”金笔，今年春节，有位同志到上海，终于请他代购了一支，果然名不虚传，使人爱不释手。抚摩再三，不禁感从中来。
    自从党中央发出了十五年赶上英国的庄严号召后，各地都风起云涌地用实际行动起来响应，上海华孚金笔厂的职工同志们就决定要在不长的时间内做到“英雄赶派克”，而这“英雄100号”金笔，据说就是为了赶派克而试制的一种新产品，它现在已经大量生产。这个英雄的行动真是鼓舞人心，上海电影制片公司专门拍了一部电影：“英雄赶派克”，的确是非常值得的。
    当我拿起这支外形美观大方、书写流利细滑的国产金笔的时候，欣喜的心情是难以形容的；同时也不由得产生了若干“浮想”。记得从十多年前当我还刚刚进小学的时候起，直到解放以前，那时一般人用的文具差不多都是外国货，“6B”铅笔是德国施德楼货，“6H”“4H”……是美国的美丽牌，铅笔刨子是“德国制”，墨水是“Waterman”（水手牌）或是“派克”，圆规仪器……几乎都是外国商标。金笔就更不用谈了，什么“爱弗释”、“派克51型”……充斥市场。尽管那时候也有较好的国产笔如金星、新民、英雄等，但在解放前这些民族工业根本就不可能得到良好的发展，更谈不上去同外国货竞赛；好像“派克51型”永远是名牌货，别人休想赶上，根本不要想同它碰。久而久之，在一部分人中间形成了一种迷信思想。直到解放以后，这种迷信思想还没有彻底清除。
    党的伟大的“超英”号召，犹如春雷一般震响大地，唤起了无数的英雄儿女闻风起舞、奋发前进、急起直追。曾几何时，我们不仅以任何资本主义国家从未有过的速度实现了钢产量翻一番的宏伟任务，而且出现了工业战线上“一马当先、万马奔腾”的动人景象，我们也有了自制的汽车，飞机，航轮，原子反应堆，电子计算机，巨型发电机……我们也有了“英雄100号”。
    自然，我们决不会满足于已有的成就。我们今年还要快马加鞭，继续向前。现在，事实作了最好的证明，1958年大跃进的成绩，特别是六亿人民的英雄气概和英雄创造，给那些有迷信思想的人上了一堂大课，让他们头脑清醒过来，挺起腰板，赶上前去，为祖国更大的跃进贡献自己的一份力量。
