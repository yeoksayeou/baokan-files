Military camping is a comprehensive national defense sports activity. It is very meaningful to organize young people to spend short-term military life during holidays. During the camping life, military education activities such as shooting, tactical exercises, and air defense and anti-poison are held; and through lively forms such as military-civilian get-togethers, visits to exhibitions, and report meetings, learn from the People's Liberation Army to improve political awareness and enhance national defense concepts. This activity is loved by the masses. Since 1953, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of students, workers, and cadres have participated in military camping activities every year. In 1958, about 1.4 million young people participated in military camping activities. Through military camping activities, they received good training in military life, strengthened their physique, and learned some military knowledge. (Attached picture)
