    Guarantee Spring Ploughing Water Use
    Jiangsu Mobilizes Technical Forces to Repair Irrigation Machinery
    Sichuan Rushes to Build Water Conservancy Projects Benefiting Spring Planting
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th) On the eve of entering the battle of spring ploughing and spring planting, various parts of Jiangsu Province are universally carrying out irrigation machinery repair work to ensure timely irrigation for spring ploughing and spring planting.
    Jiangsu Province has a large number of spring-sown crops this year and will be sown earlier than in previous years. The area under electromechanical irrigation in the province will increase from 15 million mu last year to 25 million mu. Last year, a large number of water pumps were transferred to support steel production, resulting in a high rate of loss. Therefore, this year's water pump repair task is more urgent and onerous than in previous years.
    The Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions requiring that all counties and cities with more than 100 water pumps establish repair groups of three to five people, selecting experienced cadres and technicians to be responsible for this work; all counties and cities with fewer than 100 water pumps should have special personnel designated by the water conservancy and industrial departments to be responsible. All localities have taken measures to actively implement the spirit of the instructions of the Provincial People's Committee. The Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of all factory directors of the special zone to specifically deploy the task of irrigation machinery repair. Special zones such as Suzhou, Changzhou, and Yangzhou, and some counties have successively established repair offices. The Suzhou Prefectural Committee also designated a secretary in each county to lead the repair work. Some areas have also organized work teams to go to the countryside to investigate the repair quantity and materials needed by each commune to formulate a repair plan. The required accessories are being organized for production by the industrial departments.
    To comprehensively overhaul the irrigation machinery, all localities have successively transferred back more than 3,600 water pumps that had supported steel production. According to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions of "major repairs not leaving the county, minor repairs not leaving the commune," all localities are trying to mobilize technical forces and solve the difficulties of equipment and materials. In Wujiang County, more than 200 water pumps needed to have their cylinders rebored and pistons replaced. By clearing warehouses and mobilizing the masses to contribute materials, the shortage of pistons was solved. Changshu County mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations, replacing the chassis of some water pumps with wood, solving the difficulty of accessory materials. Agricultural machinery factories in various counties of the Yangzhou Special Zone are actively conducting experiments with ductile iron, preparing to use it to replace steel.
    The slogan "Accelerate the completion of the repair task" has become the unanimous action of the vast number of repair workers in Jiangsu Province. Many areas have launched cooperation and red flag competitions between departments, factories, and counties. For example, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and other general machinery factories have contributed manpower and resources to help areas with weak mechanical foundations, rushing to produce special tools day and night. Jiangsu Province expects to complete the repair of drainage and irrigation machinery before the end of March. (Jiang Weicai)
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 16th) In Sichuan Province, there are more than 24,000 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects under construction. In the past month, due to the adoption of various measures by party committees at all levels to mobilize the masses and actively carry out the tool reform movement on water conservancy construction sites, water conservancy projects have not only progressed rapidly but also have good quality. As of now, according to statistics from Dazhou, Wanxian, Mianyang and other special zones and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, more than 8,800 water conservancy projects have been completed. The projects under construction in various places are also being expedited, striving to be completed before spring ploughing.
    According to the current situation of short time, tight tasks, and reduced labor force, but it is necessary to ensure water for spring sowing, all localities have universally strengthened the leadership of water conservancy construction and mobilized the masses to engage in on-site technical revolutions in water conservancy construction. Dazhou Special Zone vigorously promoted improved tools and organized 7,000 head of cattle to replace manpower to move earth and transport rocks, so that more than 1,400 water conservancy construction sites in the entire special zone have recently realized semi-mechanization, saving a lot of labor and significantly improving work efficiency. The water conservancy projects recently completed in the entire special zone can irrigate 123,000 mu of farmland.
    In the construction of water conservancy, all localities have also classified and ranked various projects according to the spirit of "repairing, storing, and using simultaneously, benefiting in the same year" to ensure water for spring planting, distinguishing between urgency and prioritizing key projects. The Luzhou Special Zone ranked the 56 larger water conservancy projects under construction, and then focused on 46 projects with sufficient water sources and benefiting in the same year, striving to complete them by the end of February to ensure water for spring planting; projects that cannot be effective immediately will be postponed until after the autumn.
    At the same time, all localities have also fully paid attention to winter water storage and water conservation. In Mianyang Special Zone, 95% of the 291 reservoirs have stored full or half-full reservoirs of water. More than 2.8 million mu of winter water fields in the entire special zone have mostly stored water above five inches. Large and small ponds have also generally stored water. According to the current water storage situation, 70% of the 5.6 million mu of paddy fields in the entire special zone have no problems with spring sowing water. In Bazhong County, 330,000 mu of winter water fields and 11,000 ponds are generally full of water. The water storage capacity of the county's 91 reservoirs is also sufficient, which can ensure that each mu of 180,000 mu of paddy fields has 300 cubic meters of water during the spring planting period, and each mu of 500,000 mu of dry land has 150 cubic meters of water. Many places in the province have recently established a water storage and water conservation system in conjunction with field management to strengthen water storage and water conservation.

    保证春耕用水
    江苏调集技术力量修配灌溉机械
    四川突击兴修春播受益水利工程
    本报南京16日电　江苏省各地在即将进入春耕春种战斗的前夜，普遍进行灌溉机械修配工作，保证春耕春种及时灌水。
    江苏省今年的春播作物数量较大，而且将比往年提早下种；全省机电灌溉的面积将由去年一千五百万亩增加到二千五百万亩。去年有大量的抽水机调去支援钢铁生产，损耗率较大。因此，今年抽水机的整修任务要比往年紧迫而繁重。
    江苏省人民委员会最近发出指示，要求各地凡有一百台抽水机以上的县市，建立三到五人的修配小组，选择有经验的干部和技术工人负责这项工作；凡有一百台抽水机以下的县市，都由水利、工业部门指定专人负责。各地都采取措施，积极贯彻了省人委的指示精神。中共扬州地委召开了全专区机械厂长会议，专门部署了灌溉机械修配任务。苏州、常州、扬州等专区和一部分县都先后成立了整修办公室，苏州地委还指定各县有一名书记领导修配工作。有些地区还组织工作组下乡调查各公社修配数量和所需材料，以便制订整修计划，所需配件正由工业部门组织生产。
    为了全面地检修灌溉机械，各地都将支援钢铁生产的三千六百多台抽水机陆续调回。根据省委指示“大修不出县，小修不出社”的精神，各地正在设法调集技术力量和解决设备、材料的困难。吴江县有二百多台抽水机搪气缸需要换活塞，由于清仓和发动群众献料，解决了活塞不足的困难。常熟县发动群众开展技术革新，将部分抽水机机身底盘改用木料代替，解决了配件材料的困难。扬州专区各县的农业机械厂都在积极进行球墨铸铁的试验，准备用以代替钢材。
    “加快完成修配任务”这个口号，已成为江苏省广大修配工人的一致行动。许多地区开展了部门与部门、工厂与工厂、县与县之间的协作和红旗竞赛。如扬州、泰州等通用机械厂出人出力，帮助机械基础薄弱的地区，星夜赶制专用工具。江苏省预计在3月底以前，可全部完成排灌机械的整修任务。（姜韦才）
    本报成都16日电　四川省动工兴建的中、小型水利工程共有两万四千多处，最近一月来，由于各级党委采取多种措施，发动群众，积极开展水利工地的工具改革运动，水利工程不但进展迅速，而且质量也好。至目前为止，据达县、万县、绵阳等专区和凉山彝族自治州的统计，已有八千八百多处水利工程完工。各地正在加紧施工的工程也快马加鞭，力争春耕前全部完工。
    根据当前时间短、任务紧、劳动力减少，但又必须保证春播用水的情况，各地在兴修水利中普遍加强了对水利建设的领导，发动群众搞工地技术革命。达县专区大力推广改良工具，并组织七千头耕牛代替人力搬土运石，使全专区一千四百多处水利工地最近实现了半机械化，节省了大量劳动力，工效显著提高，全专区在最近完成的水利工程即可灌田十二万三千亩。
    在兴修水利中，各地还根据“边修边蓄边用，当年受益”的精神，为确保春播用水，对各项工程分类排队，分清缓急，对重点工程进行突击。泸州专区将正在施工的较大的五十六处水利工程进行排队以后，对四十六处水源充足，当年受益的工程大力突击，力争2月底完成，以保证春播用水；对不能立即收效的工程则推迟到秋后完成。
    与此同时，各地还充分注意了冬季蓄水保水工作。绵阳专区二百九十一座水库，蓄存满库水和半库水的已占95％，全专区二百八十多万亩冬水田，大部蓄水五寸以上。大小塘堰也普遍蓄存了水。根据目前蓄水情况，全专区五百六十万亩水田已有70％的田春播用水不成问题。巴中县三十三万亩冬水田和一万一千口水塘，普遍蓄满了水。全县九十一座水库的蓄水量也很充足，可保证十八万亩水田在春播期间每亩有水三百立方公尺，五十万亩旱地每亩有水一百五十立方公尺。全省许多地方最近都结合田间管理建立了蓄水保水制度，加强了蓄水保水工作。　（李德森）（附图片）
