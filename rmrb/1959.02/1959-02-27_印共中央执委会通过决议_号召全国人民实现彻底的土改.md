Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 25th. The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India concluded its five-day plenary session tonight.

The meeting heard a report by the Party General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, on the work of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and a report on his visit to the People's Republic of China. The meeting discussed Indian trade union issues, food issues, land reform issues, and the results of the Indian National Congress's Nagpur conference.

A resolution on land reform passed at the meeting called on "all peasants and agricultural workers to promote a strong and irresistible movement that can unite all democratic forces and guarantee the implementation of land reform."

The resolution called on all Indian parties and progressive forces to work towards "thorough land reform," stating that "this will be the primary and indispensable step in reorganizing agriculture and increasing production." The resolution also pointed out that "the people and progressive forces must defeat, through their united action," the reactionary conspiracies against land reform carried out by landlords within and outside the Congress Party.

In its resolution, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India put forward seven suggestions for the "rapid and faithful" implementation of land reform. The resolution stated, "There can be no talk of planned development of the national economy without the rapid development of agriculture."

The resolution demanded that a maximum limit be set on land ownership, with no exceptions for agricultural land in the implementation of this provision. The resolution suggested that land exceeding the maximum limit be distributed to poor peasants and agricultural workers through people's committees, and that they be encouraged and assisted to form cooperatives. The resolution said that the people's committees should be composed of representatives of peasants and the government to implement land reform and pass corresponding laws; the work of land reform should be completed within one year.

The suggestions put forward in the resolution also included: prohibiting the eviction of tenant farmers; reducing rent to one-sixth of the grain harvest; and prohibiting landlords from cunningly transferring or dividing land in order to evade the provisions of the maximum land limit.

In another resolution, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India welcomed some of the resolutions of the Nagpur conference of the Congress Party and decided to call on "democratic forces and all progressives, including members of the Congress Party, to cooperate in mobilizing the masses of peasants and workers so as to effectively and democratically promote the policy of setting maximum land limits and expanding and strengthening the state-owned (economic) sector."

The committee also passed corresponding resolutions on other issues discussed at the meeting.

    印共中央执委会通过决议
    号召全国人民实现彻底的土改
    新华社新德里25日电　印度共产党中央执行委员会今天晚上结束了为时五天的全体会议。
    会议听取了党的总书记高士所作的关于苏共第二十一次代表大会的工作的报告和关于访问中华人民共和国的报告。会议讨论了印度工会问题、粮食问题、土地改革问题和关于印度国大党那格浦尔会议的结果的问题。
    会议通过的一项关于土地改革的决议，号召“全体农民和农业工人促进一个能够团结一切民主力量和保证土地改革的执行的强有力的、不可抗拒的运动”。
    决议呼吁印度各党派和进步力量为实现“彻底的土地改革而努力”。决议说，“因为这将是改组农业和增加生产的首要和必不可少的步骤”。决议还指出，“人民和进步力量必须以他们的统一行动来击败”地主在国大党内外进行的反对土地改革的反动阴谋。
    印度共产党中央执行委员会在决议中为“迅速和忠诚地”实现土地改革提出了七项建议。决议说，
  “没有农业的迅速发展，就谈不上国民经济的有计划发展”。
    决议要求就拥有土地的最高限额作出规定，在实行这一规定方面农业用地不能有任何例外。决议建议把超过最高限额的土地通过人民委员会分配给贫农和农业工人，并且鼓励和帮助他们成立合作社。决议说，人民委员会应当由农民和政府的代表组成，来执行土地改革和通过相应的法律；土地改革的工作应当在一年内完成。
    决议所提出的建议还包括：禁止驱逐佃农；把地租减少到粮食收成的六分之一；禁止地主为了逃避土地最高限额的规定而狡猾地转让或分割土地。
    印度共产党中央执行委员会在另外一项决议中，表示欢迎国大党那格浦尔会议的一些决议，并且决定号召“民主力量和包括国大党人在内的一切进步分子进行合作来动员农民和工人群众，以便能够有效地和民主地推行规定土地最高限额以及扩大和加强国营（经济）部分的政策。”
    委员会还就会上讨论过的其他问题通过了相应的决议。
