Discussion on the Question of Bourgeois Right

	"Distribution According to Labor" Is Not a Remnant of Bourgeois Right
	Ren Zhongping
	There is a Principal Difference Between Bourgeois-style Right and Remnants of Bourgeois Right

Having read Comrade Hou Mingfang's article, "Remnants of Bourgeois Right Are Not Bourgeois Right," I was greatly enlightened. The article does raise some questions that are worth studying. I would now like to offer my personal views on these questions for everyone's consideration.

Many people seize upon Marx's statement in "Critique of the Gotha Program" that "equal right here (referring to distribution according to labor—author) is still in principle bourgeois right," and interpret the socialist principle of distribution according to labor as a remnant of bourgeois right. I believe that such an interpretation is a misunderstanding in theory and harmful in practice. Precisely because of this misunderstanding, in the recent discussion of the question of bourgeois right, people have concentrated more effort on the socialist principle of distribution according to labor, and have overlooked the analysis and criticism of the real content of the remnants of bourgeois right. Therefore, first clarifying the nature of "distribution according to labor" is very beneficial to our discussion.

Is "distribution according to labor" a bourgeois right, a remnant of bourgeois right, or a bourgeois-style right? Some people think that there is no need to quibble over words and that it can be called anything. I believe that there are principal differences between these three, and they must not be confused.

Distribution according to labor is a socialist principle of distribution. Political economy textbooks call it an objective economic law of socialism. This principle can only be implemented in a socialist society that has basically eliminated classes and exploitation. According to this principle, all workers have the equal right to be remunerated according to the quality and quantity of their labor. Although "this equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor," it is essentially different from the superficial "equality" and "equivalent exchange" of capitalist society, which is actually a system of exploitation based on the amount of means of production possessed. Obviously, the principle of distribution according to labor only benefits the working people and the proletariat, and therefore the exploiting classes who "do not work but gain" deeply resent it. Therefore, we cannot regard "distribution according to labor" as a bourgeois right. After recent discussions, everyone basically agrees with this view.

	There Is No Difference in Nature Between Bourgeois Right and Remnants of Bourgeois Right

The question now, I think, should mainly be to clarify whether "distribution according to labor" is a remnant of bourgeois right or a "bourgeois-style right," as these two also have differences in nature. Some people, based on Marx's statement that it "is still in principle bourgeois-style right," interpret "distribution according to labor" as a remnant of bourgeois right. I think this is inappropriate. Although there is a big difference in quantity between remnants of bourgeois right and bourgeois right, there is no difference in quality, that is to say, remnants of bourgeois right are bourgeois right in nature, just as saying that remnants of bourgeois ideology are bourgeois ideology. None of us can say that remnants of bourgeois ideology are not bourgeois ideology. This is logically and practically untenable. Therefore, I believe that the relationship between bourgeois right and remnants of bourgeois right can only be the relationship between the whole and the part. Comrade Hou Mingfang opposes "distribution according to labor" as a bourgeois right, but believes that "distribution according to labor" is a remnant of bourgeois right. Therefore he concludes that "remnants of bourgeois right are not bourgeois right." At the same time, in order to state that "distribution according to labor" is a principle of distribution that safeguards the interests of the proletariat, he insists on saying that remnants of bourgeois right are the embodiment of the will of the proletariat and the superstructure of socialism. I believe that such a statement is incompatible with the Marxist-Leninist view of right. A class, in order to safeguard its own interests, can never and does not need to embody its own will through the remnants of the right of the opposing class. Even if we take a step back and say that "distribution according to labor" is a remnant of bourgeois right, it can only be a part of the remnant of bourgeois right. The remnants of bourgeois right also include the remaining hierarchical system, the old family system, as well as the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, etc. Can it be said that these remnants of bourgeois right are also the embodiment of the will of the proletariat? Are they also the superstructure of socialism? Of course not. The existence of these remnants of bourgeois right only hinders the development of productive forces, and "only brings harm and no benefit" to the proletariat. Therefore, the Party Central Committee proposed to actively create conditions to gradually eliminate "the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor left over from the old society that have to be preserved in the socialist period, ... remnants of unequal bourgeois right that reflect these differences." What would be the consequences if the remnants of bourgeois right were said to be the embodiment of the will of the proletariat and the superstructure of socialism? It would prevent us from touching the remnants of bourgeois right and allow them to be preserved in socialist society for a long time. Therefore, I believe that Comrade Hou Mingfang's statement is a distortion of proletarian revolutionary practice and is incompatible with the Marxist doctrine that the old state machine must be smashed.

	Distribution According to Labor Can Only Be Called Bourgeois-style Right

According to the correct formulation of Marx and Lenin, "distribution according to labor" can only be called "bourgeois-style right," and cannot be called anything else. Is this quibbling over words and splitting hairs? I believe that only by better understanding the works of our predecessors can we clarify the essence of the problem; if we do not distinguish clearly, it is easy to draw wrong conclusions. We should open Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program" and Lenin's "State and Revolution" and see that Marx and Lenin only said that "distribution according to labor" is a "bourgeois-style right" or a "narrow horizon of bourgeois-style right," and did not say that it is a remnant of bourgeois right, let alone a bourgeois right. What is the correct understanding of the so-called distribution according to labor being a "bourgeois-style right"? At that time, in order to criticize Lassalle's petty-bourgeois ideas of "equal rights" and "fair distribution," Marx pointed out that the first stage of communist society just emerged from capitalist society, and therefore, in terms of economics, morality, and wisdom, it inevitably retains traces of capitalist society. These traces are manifested in distribution. Although the socialist principle of "equal amount of labor receives equal amount of products" and "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" has been realized, which is essentially different from the superficial "equivalent exchange" of capitalism, compared with the communist principle of "distribution according to need," it "has not yet eliminated the 'shortcoming' of allowing unequal people to receive equal products according to unequal amounts of labor," that is to say, socialist society still retains traces of capitalist "equivalent exchange" in distribution. Only because of this trace of capitalist society in "distribution according to labor" did Marx believe that it is still in principle a bourgeois-style right. Special attention should be paid to the words "in principle" and "bourgeois-style." Marx did not say here that distribution according to labor is a remnant of bourgeois right. In order to better understand the formulation of "bourgeois-style right," it is helpful to repeat a passage from Lenin in "State and Revolution." Lenin said: "In communist society, for a certain period (referring to socialism—author), not only will bourgeois-style right remain, but even a bourgeois-style state without the bourgeoisie will remain." This sentence clearly tells us that bourgeois-style right is also just a bourgeois right that does not safeguard the interests of the bourgeoisie. Comrade Hou Mingfang also agrees with this point. But if we say that bourgeois-style right that does not safeguard the interests of the bourgeoisie is a remnant of bourgeois right, then, according to this reasoning, why can't we call a bourgeois-style state without the bourgeoisie a remnant of the bourgeois state? However, if we really understand Lenin's words in this way, it would be a great distortion of Lenin's works and the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the state.

From the above, I believe that we cannot call distribution according to labor a remnant of bourgeois right. If we have to call it something, we can only call it "bourgeois-style right" or a socialist principle of distribution that retains traces of capitalist society. In terms of nature, "distribution according to labor" is a weapon for us to fight against the exploiting classes, and it safeguards the interests of the proletariat. Therefore, we can say that it is a right of a proletarian nature, or we can call it the embodiment of the will of the proletariat and the superstructure of socialism. In this way, there is no contradiction in logic or in practice. The Discussion of the Principle of "Distribution According to Labor" Should Be Separated from the Criticism of Bourgeois Right

Since "distribution according to labor" is not a remnant of bourgeois right, the discussion of this socialist principle of distribution must be separated from the criticism of bourgeois right and cannot be confused. In the previous period, because some comrades believed that "distribution according to labor" was the main content of the remnants of bourgeois right, they concentrated more effort on this principle of distribution in criticizing the question of bourgeois right. Some even negated the role of "distribution according to labor" in the first stage of communist society and attributed the bad effects of the remnants of bourgeois right to this principle, saying that the many wage grades and large differences were caused by the principle of distribution according to labor. The fact is just the opposite. The reasons for the many wage grades and large differences are that they were influenced by the hierarchical system of the remnants of bourgeois right and failed to make good use of the objective law of distribution according to labor.

Of course, while criticizing bourgeois right, we can also discuss the principle of distribution according to labor; but the purpose of the discussion is to recognize the historical necessity of "distribution according to labor," to recognize its role in socialist society and its difference from communist "distribution according to need," so that we can maintain a clear mind, better utilize the positive aspects of this law, limit its negative aspects (referring to the aspect of factual inequality), serve socialist construction, and actively create conditions for the transition to a communist society of "distribution according to need." The purpose of criticizing bourgeois right is to recognize in which aspects the remnants of bourgeois right in socialist society are mainly manifested, and how they hinder the development of social productive forces. Some remnants of bourgeois right, such as the remaining hierarchical system, could have been eliminated, but due to our low level of understanding and insufficient work, some contradictions have arisen within the people. Some remnants of bourgeois right have to be preserved in socialist society, such as the difference between mental and physical labor. We should strive to create conditions to gradually eliminate these remnants of bourgeois right. I believe that distinguishing between these two issues of different nature is beneficial to our understanding of the essence of things.

### “按劳分配”不是资产阶级法权残余

专栏：关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论

    “按劳分配”不是资产阶级法权残余
    任仲平
    资产阶级式的法权同资产阶级法权残余有原则区别
    读了侯明方同志“资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权”的文章，对我有很大的启发。文章的确提出了一些大可研究的问题，我现在就这些问题提出个人的一点看法，向大家请教。
    不少人抓住马克思在“哥达纲领批判”里所说的，“这里平等的权利（指按劳分配——作者）在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”这句话，就把社会主义的按劳分配原则解释成是资产阶级法权残余。我认为，这样的解释在理论上是种误解，在实践中也是有害的。正是由于这种误解，在最近讨论资产阶级法权问题中，人们把更多的力量集中在社会主义的按劳分配的原则上，放过了对资产阶级法权残余真正内容的分析和批判。因此，首先弄清“按劳分配”是什么性质，对我们的讨论很有好处。
    “按劳分配”是资产阶级法权，还是资产阶级法权残余，或是资产阶级式的法权呢？有人认为不必咬文嚼字，可以任意称呼。我认为这三者之间有原则的区别，决不能混为一谈。
    按劳分配是社会主义的分配原则，政治经济学教科书上称它为社会主义的客观经济规律，这一原则只有在基本上消灭了阶级和剥削的社会主义社会中才能实行。根据这一原则，所有的劳动者都有按照劳动的质和量获得报酬的平等权利。尽管“这个平等的权利，对于不同等的劳动是个不平等的权利”，但是与资本主义社会的表面“平等”和“等价交换”，而实际上是按照生产资料占有的多少来进行分配的剥削制度是有着本质的区别的。很明显，按劳分配的原则只是有利于劳动人民，有利于无产阶级，因而“不劳而获”的剥削阶级对它是深恶痛绝的。因此，我们也就不能把“按劳分配”看作是资产阶级的法权。对于这一看法，经过最近的讨论，大家基本上是同意的。
    资产阶级法权和资产阶级法权残余的性质并无区别
    现在的问题，我认为主要应该弄清“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权残余还是“资产阶级式的法权”，这两者同样有性质上的区别。有人根据马克思“在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”这一句，就把“按劳分配”解释为资产阶级法权残余，我认为这是欠妥的。资产阶级法权残余与资产阶级法权虽然在量上有很大的差别，但是在质上并没有什么区别，也就是说资产阶级法权残余在性质上就是资产阶级法权，如同说资产阶级残余思想就是资产阶级思想一样。我们谁也不能够把资产阶级残余思想说成不是资产阶级思想，这在逻辑上、实际上都是说不通的。因此，我认为资产阶级法权和资产阶级法权残余的关系，也只能是整体与部分的关系。侯明方同志既反对“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权，但又认为“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权残余，因此得出了“资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权”的论断。同时他为了申述“按劳分配”是维护无产阶级利益的分配原则，硬把资产阶级法权残余说成是无产阶级意志的体现和社会主义的上层建筑。我认为，这样的提法与马列主义的法权观点是不相容的。一个阶级为了维护本阶级的利益，决不可能也不需要通过敌对阶级的法权残余把自己的意志体现出来。即使退一步说，“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权残余，但它也只能是资产阶级法权残余的一部分。资产阶级法权残余还包括残存的等级制、旧家庭制度以及工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动差别等等，难道说这些资产阶级法权残余也是无产阶级的意志体现吗？也是社会主义的上层建筑吗？当然不能这样说。这些资产阶级法权残余的存在对生产力的发展只是起阻碍的作用，对无产阶级来说“只有百害，而无一利”。所以党中央提出，要积极创造条件，逐步消灭“社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，……反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余”。如果说资产阶级法权残余是无产阶级的意志体现，是社会主义的上层建筑，其后果会怎样呢？就会使我们不去触犯资产阶级法权残余，让它在社会主义社会中长期地保存下去。因此我认为，侯明方同志的这种提法是对无产阶级革命实践的歪曲，是和马克思主义的必须打破旧的国家机器的学说不相容的。
    按劳分配只能称为资产阶级式的法权
    按照马克思、列宁的正确提法，“按劳分配”只能称为“资产阶级式的法权”，不能有其他的称呼。这是不是在扣字眼钻牛角尖呢？我认为，更好地理解前人的著作，才能弄清问题的本质；如果不分清楚，就容易得出错误的结论。我们翻开马克思的“哥达纲领批判”和列宁的“国家与革命”看看，马克思、列宁只是说“按劳分配”是“资产阶级式的法权”，或是“资产阶级式的法权狭隘眼界”，而没有说它是资产阶级法权残余，当然更没有说是资产阶级法权。所谓按劳分配是“资产阶级式的法权”正确的理解应该是怎样的呢？马克思当时为了批判拉萨尔所说的“平等的权利”和“公平的分配”这一小资产阶级的思想，指出共产主义社会的第一阶段，是刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来的，因此在经济、道德和智慧等各方面，都不可避免地还会保留资本主义社会的痕迹。这些痕迹表现在分配上，虽然“按等量劳动领得等量产品”、“不劳动者不得食”的社会主义原则已经实现了，这与资本主义的表面上的“等价交换”有本质上的区别；但是与共产主义“按需分配”的原则比较起来，“还没有消除容许不相等人们按不等量的劳动领取等量产品”的这一“缺点”，也就是说社会主义社会在分配上还保留了资本主义“等价交换”的痕迹。仅仅因为“按劳分配”的这一资本主义社会的痕迹，马克思才认为在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权。应该特别注意“在原则上”和“资产阶级式”这几个字，马克思在这里并没有说按劳分配就是资产阶级法权残余。为了更好地理解“资产阶级式的法权”这一提法，重复一下列宁在“国家与革命”中的一段话是有好处的。列宁说：“在共产主义社会，在一定时期以内（指社会主义——作者）不仅会保留着资产阶级式的法权，甚至还会保留着没有资产阶级的资产阶级式的国家。”这句话清楚地告诉了我们，资产阶级式的法权也只是一个不维护资产阶级利益的资产阶级法权。这一点侯明方同志也是同意的。但是如果把不维护资产阶级利益的资产阶级式的法权说成是资产阶级法权残余，照这样推论下去，何尝不可以把没有资产阶级的资产阶级式的国家称为是资产阶级国家的残余。可是，如果真是这样理解列宁的话，这就是对列宁的著作和马列主义的国家学说的一个极大的歪曲。
    由上所述，我认为也不能把按劳分配称为资产阶级法权的残余，如果要叫的话，也只能叫它是“资产阶级式的法权”，或者是保留有资本主义社会痕迹的社会主义的分配原则。按性质来说，“按劳分配”是我们和剥削阶级作斗争的武器，是维护无产阶级的利益的，因此我们可以说它是无产阶级性质的法权，也可以称它是无产阶级意志的体现，是社会主义的上层建筑，这样，在逻辑上、实践上就没有任何矛盾了。讨论“按劳分配”原则，要和批判资产阶级法权分别开来
    既然“按劳分配”不是资产阶级法权残余，因此必须把讨论按劳分配这一社会主义的分配原则和批判资产阶级法权分开，不能混淆在一起。前一个时期，由于一些同志认为“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权残余的主要内容，因而在批判资产阶级法权问题上，把更多的力量集中在这一分配原则上，有的甚至否定了“按劳分配”在共产主义社会第一阶段中的作用，把资产阶级法权残余所起的坏作用都记在这一原则的账上，说工资等级多，差别大是按劳分配的原则所造成的。事实恰恰相反，工资等级多，差别大的原因，是受了资产阶级法权残余的等级制的影响，没有能够很好地运用按劳分配这一客观规律。
    当然在批判资产阶级法权的同时，也可以讨论按劳分配这一原则；但讨论的目的，在于认识“按劳分配”的历史必然性，认识它在社会主义社会中的作用以及它和共产主义“按需分配”的区别等，从而使我们保持清醒的头脑，更好地利用这一规律的积极方面，限制它的消极方面（指事实上不平等这一方面），为社会主义建设服务，并且为过渡到“按需分配”的共产主义社会积极地创造条件。而批判资产阶级法权的目的，在于认识社会主义社会中的资产阶级法权残余主要表现在哪些方面，它们怎样阻碍了社会生产力的发展？有些资产阶级法权残余，如残存的等级制，本来可以消除它的作用，但由于我们的认识水平不高，工作做得不够好，因此影响人民内部就产生了一些矛盾。有些资产阶级法权残余，在社会主义社会还不得不保存下来，如脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别就是这样，我们应该怎样努力创造条件，逐步地消除这些资产阶级法权残余。我认为，分清这两个不同性质的问题，对我们认清事物的本质是有好处的。
