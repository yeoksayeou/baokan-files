    I Love Tunnels, Fujian Frontline
    A Certain Artillery Unit, Wu Shiqin
    Tunnel, tunnel, I love you, you are like our own brothers.
    I use wooden pillars to make crutches for you,
    I use wooden planks to make new clothes for you.
    You always stand on the frontline of battle,
    Guaranteeing our victory.
    Tunnel, tunnel, I love you, you are like our own brothers,
    Although this is our first meeting,
    Our elders know you well.
    You were with us for eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan,
    Forming a deep friendship with you.
    Tunnel, tunnel, I love you, you are like our own brothers,
    You've worked hard!
    You should rest,
    But you know that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind,
    You know that our motherland's construction is advancing rapidly.
    You also know that the factories in our motherland are increasing every day,
    You also know that the people's communes are being established in large numbers.
    You know even more that Taiwan has not yet been liberated.
    And that there is still American imperialism on this earth.
    You, this body tempered into steel,
    Shoulder the heavy burden, together with new friends,
    If we don't thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the enemy,
    We will never be separated!
    Never be separated.

    我爱坑道福建前线
    某部炮兵　吴世钦坑道，坑道，我爱你，你像我们的亲兄弟。我用木柱给你做拐杖，我用木板给你做新衣。你永远站在战斗最前线，保障我们得胜利。坑道，坑道，我爱你，你像我们的亲兄弟，我们见面虽说第一回，我们的长辈你可熟悉。抗日战争跟你做过八年伴，同你结下了深厚的友谊。坑道，坑道我爱你，你像我们的亲兄弟，你辛苦了！你该休息，但你知道东风压倒西风，你知道祖国建设一日千里。你也知道祖国的工厂日日增多，你也知道人民公社大量办起。你更知道台湾还没有解放。地球上还有美帝国主义。你这百炼成钢的身体，重担起重担和新朋友在一起，如果不彻底干净的消灭敌人，咱们永远不分离！永远不分离。
