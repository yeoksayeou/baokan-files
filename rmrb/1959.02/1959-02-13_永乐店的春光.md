Springtime is Coming

Spring Scenery in Yongle Store
Su Yang

In early spring, the chill in the suburbs of Beijing has not yet dissipated. Fierce winds carrying yellow sand attack in gusts, and goose feather snow occasionally sprinkles down. But how can wind and snow suppress people's soaring enthusiasm? Take a look, these are the people of the Yongle Store People's Commune. In order to turn that thin, sandy, saline-alkali land into fertile soil, in order to strive for an even greater harvest this year, they are valiantly standing tall, fighting the severe cold, challenging the frozen earth, and enthusiastically throwing themselves into a massive manure accumulation campaign. The Party Committee Secretary goes to the fields to inspect work carrying a manure basket; the office cadres, after getting off work and leaving the office, carry manure baskets; teachers and students, in their spare time, also carry manure baskets… Individuals, groups of three or five, are digging black soil, scooping pit mud, digging manure pits, and picking up donkey dung. How vigorously those old ladies are working, they have already taken off their thick cotton-padded coats, and sweat is dripping from their foreheads; how happily those girls are working, talking for a while, laughing for a while, and then singing songs; that old man with white hair and beard is bending over, squinting his eyes, carefully searching for the animal manure buried in the sand; that team of Young Pioneers, while accumulating manure, also shout slogans, paste posters, and cheer for the uncles and aunts. Iron shovels fly, manure forks wave, laughter shakes the earth, and songs resonate in the sky. Before long, the empty manure baskets are filled to the brim; before long, piles of fertilizer are piled up like small mountains in front of every household! The manure-carrying carts shuttle back and forth, carrying fertilizer and the hopes of the people towards the wheat fields.

You say these small mountain-like piles of fertilizer come easily? Not at all. It is not only accumulated little by little by the thousands of men, women, old and young, but also found after everyone thought of methods and ideas.

When they just finished listening to the Party Committee Secretary of the commune's mobilization report on accumulating fertilizer, some production team leaders were a little worried: From the application of fertilizer to sow wheat last autumn to the current topdressing of wheat fields, the fertilizer has already been used up, where can we find more fertilizer sources? The Party Branch Secretary of the Canal Head Sub-station learned about this kind of thinking of the masses and decided to hold a "Zhuge Liang" meeting to solve the problem.

Seven production team leaders came to participate in the Zhuge Liang meeting. With more people, more ideas came up. Chen Baotian, the captain of the first team, said: "When we built public toilets last year, the manure from many private latrines was filled in without being dug out. Isn't digging it out now excellent fine fertilizer?" Wan Wenhua, the captain of the third team, suddenly realized and said: "The bottom of the old pigsties in the commune members' homes are treasures, one sty can definitely produce three to four thousand catties." It turned out that after the commune collectively raised pigs, these old sty soils had long been forgotten.

In this way, one person saying one thing and another saying another, some said that a lot of fertilizer could be dug from the old kiln soil by the village. Some said that the empty carts returning from delivering fertilizer could be used to pull the sandy soil from the edge of the field to each household, so that everyone could pour urine into the sandy soil to create soil fertilizer. Others said: Pit mud can be found in certain places, and the foundations of some collapsed old houses can be dug out as fertilizer. Everyone at the meeting came up with many ideas and thought of many fertilizer sources.

This time, the team leaders were full of confidence. As soon as the meeting adjourned, they went to the masses to find "Zhuge Liangs."

Some production team leaders found the breeder, who said that although the manure is swept up every day in the livestock shed, the livestock urine seeps deep into the soil. You can dig a foot deep and then pad it with new soil, which will not only get fertilizer but also make the livestock comfortable. Some team leaders found the cook, who said that every time you cook, you can shovel some soil into the stove to burn with it. After being smoked by the fire, the soil will turn into fertilizer. Someone remembered who had buried garbage, manure pits, circle bottoms, etc., in the corners of alleys or in the quiet places of streets, and told the team leaders. The manure accumulation campaign has changed from having few methods and weak confidence to being truly resourceful.

Early this morning, snowflakes were floating in the air, and Zhao Wenlu, a seventy-three-year-old commune member, went out to pick up manure as usual, carrying a manure basket on his back. Others asked him, "It's snowing, are you still going out?" He proudly replied, "The worse the weather, the less others want to go out, the more I want to go out, so I can pick up more manure to bring back."

In fact, in the vigorous manure accumulation campaign, everyone went out to accumulate manure no matter how bad the weather was. However, Old Man Zhao does have his own set of methods. These days, even if everyone is out, he alone can always pick up three to four hundred catties of manure every day.

Old Man Zhao is a farming expert with forty or fifty years of experience, and also a manure picking expert. The crops he grows always yield more grain than those grown by others. One of the secrets is to apply more fertilizer. The big winter melon weighing more than sixty catties that he grew last year was even tied with a big red silk ribbon and placed in the Tongzhou District Agricultural Exhibition Hall.

For many years, Old Man Zhao has really been inseparable from the manure basket all day long. He carries it when he goes to the street, takes it when he goes to the market, and when he goes to the fields to work, he also carries a manure basket on the hoe, picking up manure while walking. He said to people, "Picking up manure is more and more addictive, and the manure basket is my old partner." He also has a set of ways to find manure. For example, within a radius of twenty miles of Derenwu Village, he knows almost everything about which roads are often used by large vehicles, which village has a market, and what direction the large vehicles come from on market days. Wherever vehicles go, he goes to pick up manure. There is more manure to pick up on market days, and if he doesn't have time to send it back, he will pile it up by the roadside first, and then slowly carry it back after the market is over. He knows that on snowy days, stray dogs like to defecate on both sides of the road, and on sunny days, domestic animals and poultry like to defecate near the wood piles and in quiet places...

Isn't this him walking over? Listen, he is singing while walking, so energetically!

The old man is seventy-three this year,
Actively picking up manure to spread on the fields.
This year, the wheat is growing well, with a yield of several thousand catties per mu. …

Among the manure accumulation crowd, there are five rosy-cheeked and energetic young girls who often gather together. They are the famous "Five Sisters."

Speaking of them, the people of the Yongle Store People's Commune will point their fingers and count their names one by one: Liu Shirong, Zhao Guiying, Zhang Yuqin, Li Xiuting, Zhao Shuyun. When deep plowing the land, one stroke of their shovels shakes the earth, and in a short while, the five of them are at the forefront. When irrigating wheat fields, they carry water and run back and forth, not willing to take a break even if the water soaks through their shoes and socks. In engaging in sideline production, other women can only sew one in a half soles per day, but they can sew three soles per day! The red flag is always flying in their group. They are not from the same village and did not know each other in the past. It is glorious and heroic labor that tightly binds them together, making them more intimate than real sisters. They eat together, live together, work together, and are also in the same group.

After the Party called for vigorously accumulating fertilizer, they immediately proposed a guarantee: In addition to completing their sideline production as usual every day, each person will accumulate 2,000 catties of fertilizer every day. When the sky was still dark, they climbed out of the warm bed and went to the village to dig manure pits. They dug seven or eight loads in two mornings; at dusk, taking advantage of the faint light of the setting sun, they divided into two groups and went outside the village to find fine fertilizer. There are many people picking up fine fertilizer. If you don't find a way, you will definitely not be able to beat others. What should you do? The eldest sister, Liu Shirong, came up with a good idea: Not far away, more than a thousand people are digging a man-made lake. They always have to defecate and urinate nearby. Let's go there and wait to pick up human manure. The four younger sisters all agreed to the eldest sister's suggestion, and every afternoon they carried manure baskets to that place. Sure enough, they could pick up four or five loads at a time. Look, they are now walking out of the village one by one, excitedly singing "Socialism is Good", carrying manure baskets, and walking in the direction of the artificial lake. (Attached picture)

    永乐店的春光
    苏扬
    初春时节，京郊寒意未消。狂风挟着黄沙阵阵袭来，鹅毛雪不时纷纷洒下。但是，风雪怎么能抑制人们的冲天干劲呢？你来看一看，这是永乐店人民公社的人们。为了使那薄土沙洼盐碱地变成肥沃的土壤，为了争取今年更大的丰收，他们正威风凛凛地挺起胸脯，跟严寒搏斗，向冻土挑战，热情洋溢地投身入声势浩大的积肥运动之中。党委书记下地检查工作背着粪筐；机关干部下班走出办公室后，背着粪筐；老师、学生课余的时候，也背着粪筐……单个儿的人，三五成群的人，都在挖黑土，刨坑泥，掘粪坑，拣驴粪。那些老太太们干得多么起劲，厚厚的棉袄已经脱掉了，头上还直淌汗；那群姑娘们干得多欢，一会儿说，一会儿笑，一会儿又唱起歌来；那个须发都白了的老头，正弯着腰，眯缝着眼，仔细地寻找那埋在沙土里的牲口粪；那一队少先队员，一面积肥，一面还喊口号，贴标语，给叔叔阿姨们打气。铁铣飞舞，粪杈晃动，笑声动地，歌声震天。不一会，空空的粪筐就被装得满满的了；不一会，家家户户门口，肥料就堆成了一座小山！送肥的大车穿梭般来往，载着肥料、载着人们的希望奔向麦田。
    你说这一座座小山似的肥料来得容易么？才不哩。它不只是男女老幼千军万马一点一滴积累起来的，而且也是经过大家想办法、出主意，才找到的。
    刚听完公社党委书记动员积肥报告的时候，有的生产队长心里有点嘀咕：从去年秋后施肥种麦到现在的麦田追肥，肥料已经用得差不离了，哪里还有肥源呢？渠头分站的党支部书记了解到大伙的这种思想，决定开个诸葛亮会来解决问题。
    七个生产队长都来参加诸葛亮会。人一多，办法也就来了。一队队长陈宝田说：“去年大建公共厕所的时候，许多私人茅坑的粪没有起出来就填平了，现在挖出来，不是上好的细肥吗？”三队队长宛文华听了，恍然大悟说：“社员家里的老猪圈底可是好家伙，一个圈准能起出三几千斤。”原来公社集体养猪后，这些老圈土早已被人忘记。
    就这样，你一言他一语，有的说，村边的老窑土可以扒出好些肥来。有的说，用送肥回来的空车把地头的砂土拉来送给各户，让大家把尿泼到砂土里造土化肥。有的又说：某处某处有坑泥，某处某处有几间塌了的老屋基，都可以挖出来当肥料。大家在会上就凑出了好多主意，想到了好多肥源。
    这一来，队长们的信心十足。一散会，他们就分头到群众中去找诸葛亮了。
    有的生产队长找到了饲养员，饲养员说，牲口棚里虽然每天都打扫起粪，但是牲口尿渗进土里很深，可以深挖一尺，再垫上新土，既得肥料，又使牲口舒服。有的队长找到了炊事员，炊事员说，每次做饭的时候，铲些土在炉膛里一起烧，经火一熏，土就变成了肥料。有人记得谁家胡同角落里或是哪条街的背静处有被埋掉的垃圾、粪坑、圈底等等，也都告诉了队长们。积肥运动也就由办法少，信心不强，变得真正是左右逢源了。
    这天大清早，空中飘着雪花，七十三岁的老社员赵文禄就照往常一样，背起粪筐出去拾粪了。别人问他：“下雪天，还出去吗？”他自豪地回答说：“天越是不好，别人越是不想出去，我就更要出去，好多拾一点粪回来。”
    其实，在轰轰烈烈的积肥运动里，天气再坏，大家也都出去积肥了。不过赵老头确实有自己的一套办法。这些天，即使大家都出动，他一个人每天光是粪肥也总能拣到三、四百斤。
    赵老头子是一个有四、五十年经验的种田能手，也是一个拾粪的专家。他种的田总要比别人种的多打一些粮食。秘诀之一，就是多施肥。他去年种出的一个六十多斤重的大冬瓜，还系着大红绸带摆在通州区的农业展览馆里呢。
    多少年来，赵老头真是整天粪筐不离身，上街背着，赶集带着，下地干活，锄头上也要挑着个粪筐，边走边拣粪。他对人说：“粪是越拾越有瘾，粪筐就是我的老伴。”他还有一套找粪的门路。例如，在德仁务村方圆二十里内，哪些道路常走大车，哪个村什么时候有集，有集的日子都是从甚么方向来大车，他都知道个八九不离十。哪里走车，他就到哪里去拾粪。赶集的日子拾粪多，来不及往回送，他就先堆在路旁，等集过去再慢慢背回。他知道，下雪天，野狗爱在道路的两旁拉屎，晴天，家畜、家禽爱在柴垛附近和僻静的地方拉屎……
    这不是他走过来了吗？你听，他正边走边唱，多带劲！
    老汉今年七十三，
    积极拾粪去铺田。
    今年小麦长得好，每亩产量好几千。……
    在积肥的人群中，有五个红光满面生气勃勃的年青姑娘经常聚在一起，她们是远近驰名的“五姐妹”。
    说起她们，永乐店人民公社的人们就会点着指头，一个个地数出她们的名字来：刘士荣、赵桂英、张玉琴、李秀亭、赵淑云。在深翻土地的时候，她们一铣下去就震得大地发抖，一会儿工夫五个人就翻在最前头。在浇灌麦田的时候，她们挑着水来去飞跑，水浸透了鞋袜也不肯歇口气。在搞副业生产中，别的妇女每人每天只能纳一只多鞋底，她们每人每天却能纳三只！红旗永远在她们小组里飘扬翻飞。她们不是一个村的，过去互相并不认识，是光荣豪迈的劳动紧紧地把她们系结在一起，使她们比真正的姊妹还要亲热。她们一块吃，一块住，一块干活，而且还同在一个团小组里。
    党号召大搞积肥以后，她们立刻提出了保证：除了每天照常完成副业生产外，每人每天积肥二千斤。天还是黑沉沉的时候，她们就从暖和的被窝里爬了起来，到村里去挖粪坑，两个早晨就挖了七八挑；薄暮时分，趁着夕阳的微弱的光芒，她们就分成两组到村外去找细肥。捡细肥的人很多呀，不找门道一定搞不过别人，怎么办呢？大姐刘士荣想出了一个好主意：不远的地方，有一千多人在挖人造湖，他们总得在附近大便小便，咱们就到那儿去候着拣人粪。四个妹妹都赞成大姐的建议，每天下午就提着粪筐到那儿去。果然一次就能拾到四、五挑。你看，她们现在又一个挨一个地正走出村子，兴冲冲地唱着“社会主义好”，抬着粪筐，朝着人工湖那个方向走去了。（附图片）
