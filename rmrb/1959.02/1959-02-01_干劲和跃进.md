    Drive and Leap Forward
    He Ming
    Why did our socialist construction undertaking achieve a Great Leap Forward last year? The answer is: Our Leap Forward plan conforms to objective laws. This is correct. However, it only answers half of the question; it must also be supplemented by the answer: it is also due to the great enthusiasm of the broad masses of people under the leadership of the Party.

    Without drive, there would be no leap forward—this was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future.

    A plan that conforms to objective laws means that it has objective possibilities for realization. A plan that violates objective laws, something that is objectively impossible, cannot be accomplished no matter how hard people try. However, a plan that conforms to objective laws must also be realized by people, and in the process of realization, great effort must be made to exert drive and overcome difficulties. If it can be completed easily without exerting much effort, it cannot be considered a Leap Forward plan.

    Even seven- or eight-year-old children understand this principle within their own lives. For example, when encountering a ditch, they are inherently capable of jumping over it according to their physical strength, but they have to jump with force; without force, they cannot jump over it. Comparing the small to the large, our work and transformation of the objective world are the same.

    We advocate respecting objective laws in order to better and more fully exert drive. Understanding objective laws is wisdom, and soaring drive is courage. With both wisdom and courage, we can win battles in construction endeavors. Without drive, even a plan that conforms to objective laws will become mere empty talk. Conservatives are those who lack both courage and wisdom. According to their viewpoint, it is: "Isn't it better to set the targets lower, so that we can guarantee their completion? Won't it avoid violating objective laws?" Here, firstly, they lack courage, lack drive, and are unwilling to put in the effort to overcome difficulties and strive for achievable results; secondly, they lack wisdom, and they are primarily violating the objective law of high-speed development in socialist construction.

    跃进随笔
    干劲和跃进
    何明
    去年，我们的社会主义建设事业，为什么获得了大跃进？答复说：我们的跃进计划符合客观规律。这是对的。但是，它却只答复了问题的一半；还必得补充答复说：还由于广大人民在党的领导下发挥了冲天干劲。
    没有干劲，就没有跃进——在过去是这样，现在也是这样，将来还是这样。
    计划符合客观规律，这是说，它有实现的客观可能性。违背客观规律的计划，客观上没有可能的事情，人们怎么干也办不到。但是，符合客观规律的计划，也还得人去实现，而且在实现过程中，必须大大地发挥干劲，克服困难。如果不用使大气力，轻而易举就可完成，也算不得跃进计划了。
    这个道理，七八岁的小孩子，在他们的生活范围内，也是懂得的。比如碰到一个水沟，按其体力本来是能够跳过去的，但要使劲跳；不使劲还是跳不过去。将小比大，我们做工作、改造客观世界，也是这样。
    我们提倡尊重客观规律，是为了更好、更充分地发挥干劲。懂得客观规律是智，冲天干劲是勇，智勇双全就能在建设事业上打胜仗。如果没有干劲，那么，即使有了符合客观规律的计划，也会成为纸上谈兵。保守主义者是既无勇又无智的。按照他们的观点看来，就是：“把指标订得低些，不是更能保证完成吗？不是不会违背客观规律吗？”这里，第一，就是他们无勇，没有干劲，不肯花力气去克服困难，争取可以争取到的成绩；第二，他们无智，他们首先是违背了社会主义建设高速度发展的客观规律。
