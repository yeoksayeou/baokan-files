Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 25th: The Romanian News Agency issued a statement today, authorized by the government, saying that Israeli newspapers and officials, as well as many Western reactionary newspapers, have launched a disruptive and provocative campaign regarding the so-called large-scale Jewish emigration from Romania. The statement said: "The purpose of this campaign is to slander the Romanian People's Republic and its policies, to sow suspicion and distrust between Arab countries and Romania, and to obstruct friendly relations between these countries and Romania."

The statement said: As everyone knows, the Romanian people have always sympathized with the struggles of the peoples of Arab countries to liberate themselves from colonial oppression and to fight for national independence. Imperialists do not like the consolidated and sincere friendship between the Romanian and Arab peoples, and they have not abandoned their plans to enslave the Arab countries, attempting to turn the Middle East into a hotbed of unrest and military conflict. To this end, they have resorted to the leaders of Israeli and world Zionism to launch a provocative campaign concerning the so-called large-scale emigration of Jews from Romania to Israel. Israeli newspapers and officials have clamored loudly, saying that Jewish residents are migrating in large numbers from "Eastern countries." They have even fabricated figures. For example, the aforementioned newspapers said that 300,000 people were going to leave Romania, but according to the 1956 census, there were only 146,000 Jews in Romania in total.

The statement said that the matter of Jews leaving Romania for Israel is quite another thing entirely: As everyone knows, during the Second World War and after the war, many Jewish families were broken up, and now the Romanian authorities are allowing those Jews who have relatives in other countries to leave so that they can reunite with their families.

The statement pointed out that in all these clamorous campaigns, one can perceive the tricks being played by American imperialists.

The statement went on to refute the unfounded slander that the Romanian government had signed an agreement with Israel for Jews to go to Israel.

In discussing the Romanian government's attitude towards the sabotage activities of Zionists, the statement said that the Israeli Embassy in Romania frequently attempted to create chaos among the Jewish residents. This situation is intolerable.

The statement emphasized: "There is no national oppression or national discrimination in our country. The Romanian Constitution stipulates that people of all nationalities enjoy complete and equal rights in all respects. Therefore, Romania does not want to force these people to leave Romania. On the contrary, we advise them not to leave, but if they insist on leaving, we certainly will not prevent them."

The statement said that the Romanian people are surprised and regretful that some newspapers and even officials in the United Arab Republic have been influenced by these malicious attacks. Obviously, this attitude cannot but cast a shadow on the friendly relations between our two countries, and it will only add fuel to the fire of Zionists.

The statement concluded by saying that the people of our country believe that the initiators of this attack will suffer the consequences of their own actions, and the conspiracies of imperialists and Zionists can never undermine the friendly relations between our country and the Arab countries.

    罗马尼亚通讯社受权发表声明
    驳斥所谓犹太移民的诽谤
    新华社布加勒斯特25日电　罗马尼亚通讯社今天在一篇受权发表的声明中说，以色列报刊和官方人士以及许多西方反动报纸就所谓大批犹太人迁离罗马尼亚发动了一个破坏和挑拨运动。声明说：“这个运动目的在于诽谤罗马尼亚人民共和国及其政策，在阿拉伯国家和罗马尼亚之间散布猜疑和不信任，阻挠这些国家同罗马尼亚的友好联系。”
    声明说：谁都知道，罗马尼亚人民一向同情阿拉伯国家的人民为从殖民压迫下获得解放、为争取民族独立所进行的斗争。帝国主义者不喜欢罗马尼亚和阿拉伯人民之间的巩固和真诚的友谊，他们并未放弃奴役阿拉伯国家的计划，企图把中东变为不安和军事冲突的策源地。为此，他们借助于以色列的和世界犹太复国主义的领导人士来发动一个所谓大批犹太人从罗马尼亚迁往以色列的挑拨运动。以色列报刊和官方人士高声叫嚷，说什么犹太居民从“东方国家”大批迁移。他们甚至弄出了数字。例如，上述报刊说，从罗马尼亚要走三十万人，但是根据1956年的人口统计，罗马尼亚犹太人总共只有十四万六千多人。
    声明说，至于犹太人离开罗马尼亚到以色列，那完全是另外一回事：大家知道，在第二次世界大战期间和战后，有许多犹太人家庭被拆散了，现在罗马尼亚当局允许那些有亲属在其他国家的犹太人离开，以便他们和自己的家庭团聚。
    声明指出，在所有这些大叫大嚷的运动中，人们可以觉察到美国帝国主义分子所使出的花招来。
    声明接着还驳斥了所谓罗马尼亚政府同以色列签订了犹太人去以色列的协定，指出这是毫无根据的诽谤。
    在谈到罗马尼亚政府对犹太复国主义者的破坏活动所持的态度时，声明说，以色列驻罗马尼亚的公使馆经常试图在犹太居民中间制造混乱。这种情况是不能容忍的。
    声明强调说：“在我国没有民族压迫和民族歧视。罗马尼亚宪法规定，各民族的人民在各方面都享有完全平等的权利。因此，罗马尼亚并不想使这些人离开罗马尼亚，正相反，我们劝他们不要离开，但是，如果他们坚持离开，我们当然也不阻止。”
    声明说，罗马尼亚人民感到惊异和遗憾的是，阿拉伯联合共和国的某些报刊甚至官方人士竟受了这些恶意攻击的影响。显然，这种态度不能不对我们两国之间的友好关系投下暗影，它只会给犹太复国主义者火上加油。
    声明最后说，我国人民相信，这种攻击的发起者将自作自受，帝国主义和犹太复国主义者的阴谋绝不能破坏我国同阿拉伯国家间的友好关系。
