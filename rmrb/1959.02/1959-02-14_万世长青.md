Everlasting Evergreen

"We are getting better day by day," and celebratory days are also increasing. We just cheered the victorious closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and in the blink of an eye, it is the ninth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

"The Sino-Soviet alliance is invincible in the world." For nine years, the Sino-Soviet alliance has become increasingly consolidated, the people of our two countries have become increasingly happy, and the imperialists have become increasingly panicked.

The nearly nine hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, the parties of the two countries, and the governments of the two countries cherish Sino-Soviet friendship and unity as they cherish their own eyes, and regard consolidating and enhancing the friendship and unity between the two countries as their national policy. Who, among those committed to peace and democracy, national liberation, and the construction of communism and socialism, can fail to rejoice wholeheartedly at Sino-Soviet friendship and unity? Conversely, which imperialists and all their running dogs do not regard Sino-Soviet friendship and unity as a thorn in their side, and the undermining of the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union as their supreme national policy?

There is no need to offer any further explanation or interpretation of the role and significance of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance. People can completely judge one's position from one's attitude and feelings towards this matter.

The more united we are, the faster we advance; the more the east wind prevails, the better our days will be. This is an irrefutable truth that has been repeatedly verified over the past nine years.

The imperialists do not understand this at all. They do not believe in the unity of genuine Marxists in the world. In order to undermine the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people, they have tried everything possible and "struggled arduously" for nine years. They have hoped and prayed year after year, but year after year they have been disappointed, running into walls, watching us get better year after year, and them rotting year after year, becoming frantic and wailing, but to no avail.

The imperialists and the Tito clique, since last year, have had a dream of finding something to exploit in the journey of the Chinese and Soviet people advancing side by side. However, they forgot to look up and see that we are walking on the same broad road, we are heading towards the same goal, and we are advancing hand in hand. What can the pitiful things find from the heels of our shoes? The 21st Congress of the CPSU gave them a slap in the face, and the report by Comrade Khrushchev and the speech by Comrade Zhou Enlai sank them to the bottom of the water again. Even Dulles had to say "I don't think there are any differences..." The Sino-Soviet agreement on expanding economic cooperation was another slap in the face: Sino-Soviet expanded economic cooperation further strengthened the unity and power of the socialist camp.

The imperialists and the Tito clique should understand a little bit: the Soviet people wholeheartedly welcome all the achievements of China's construction of socialism, and the Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome the comprehensive unfolding of communist construction in the Soviet Union, because we all know that this has established a better material foundation for the unity and friendship between the two countries.

Let us recall what Chairman Mao Zedong said nine years ago: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but it will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice." The unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union will last forever!

    “我们一天天好起来”，喜庆的日子也越来越多。我们刚刚欢呼过苏共二十一次代表大会的胜利闭幕，转眼又到了中苏友好同盟条约九周年了。
    “中苏同盟无敌于天下”。九年来，中苏同盟越来越巩固，我们两国人民越来越高兴，帝国主义越来越惊慌。
    中苏两国近九亿人民、两国的党和两个国家的政府，像珍视自己的眼睛一样的珍视中苏友谊和团结，把巩固和增进两国的友谊和团结当作自己的国策。致力于和平民主，致力于民族解放，致力于建设共产主义和社会主义的人，谁能不为中苏友好团结而衷心的欢喜呢？反之，帝国主义和它们的一切走狗，谁又不是把中苏友好团结看作他们的眼中钉，而把破坏中苏两国的友好团结，当作他们的最高国策呢？
    用不着再对中苏两国友好同盟的作用和意义作什么更多的说明和解释，人们完全可以从一个人对待这件事情的态度和感情上，判断出他的立场来。
    我们越团结，我们就前进的越快，东风越盛，我们的日子就过得越好。这是九年来屡经证实了的一个颠扑不破的真理。
    帝国主义根本不懂得这一点。他们不相信世界上的真正的马克思主义者的团结一致。为了破坏中苏两国人民的友谊团结，他们想尽了一切办法，“艰苦奋斗”了九年。他们一年年地盼望祈求，但一年年总是落空、碰壁，眼看着我们一年年好起来，他们一年年烂下去，急得发疯，哀嚎，但也毫无办法。
    帝国主义者和铁托集团，去年以来，曾经有过一个梦想，希望在中苏人民并肩大踏步前进的路程上，找到一点什么可以利用的东西。可是，他们忘了抬起头来看一看，我们走的是同一条康庄大道，我们奔向的是同一个目标，我们是手挽手在共同前进的。可怜的东西们，从我们鞋后跟上能够找出什么来呢？苏共二十一次代表大会给了他们一记耳光，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告，周恩来同志的致词，又使他们沉没到水底去了。连杜勒斯也不得不说起“我认为没有任何分歧……”来了。中苏签订的扩大经济合作协定又是一记耳光：中苏扩大经济合作，进一步加强了社会主义阵营各国的团结和威力。
    帝国主义者和铁托集团总该明白一点了：苏联人民衷心欢迎中国的建设社会主义的一切成就，中国人民衷心欢迎苏联的全面展开的共产主义建设，因为我们都知道，这给两国的团结和友谊，建立了更好的物质基础。
    让我们再来回忆一下毛泽东主席在九年前就说过的话吧：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”中苏两国人民的团结友谊，万世长青！
