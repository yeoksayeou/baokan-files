Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 16th: The foundation work for the piers of the second iron bridge across the Yangtze River – the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing – has entered a stage of full, tense construction. All nineteen piers for the main bridge and the overpass bridge spanning the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are under construction.

Bridge construction workers are engaged in a competition, determined to work hard during the short dry season for a few months, racing against the flood to complete the construction of all nine piers in the water, bringing them above the water level. Several underwater piers originally planned for construction in February were started ahead of schedule in December of last year and January of this year. Standing on the riverbank, one can see the vast labor force working hard on the north and south banks. Next to the underwater piers, large floating cranes, floating concrete factories, power generation ships, and various machines are densely packed. Ships loaded with large tubular piles, cement, and river sand are continuously transported to the piers, filling the waterway and leaving only a narrow passage for ships to pass through. Underwater Pier No. 3, which started construction earlier, has already emerged from the water. The seven tall piers on the north and south banks have also been erected.

The construction method for the foundation of this bridge is the latest "large tubular pile drilling method" created during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. When building Underwater Pier No. 3, extremely hard isolated rocks were encountered in the riverbed strata. Workers, cadres, and technicians worked together to develop ideas to improve tools and techniques, finally enabling the large tubular piles to pass through the isolated rocks and reach the bedrock. In January, when sinking large tubular piles for Underwater Piers No. 5 and No. 6, they encountered an unforeseen layer of cobblestones seven meters thick, preventing the piles from sinking and making it impossible to drill into the bedrock. Bridge construction workers used high-pressure water pumps to suck out small cobblestones, and divers went deep into the riverbed to hoist large cobblestones to the surface. After half a month of hard work, the sinking of the tubular piles for Pier No. 5 is nearing completion.

In addition to using modern construction tools, in the past few months, the staff of the bridge construction site have also manufactured 46 pieces of equipment combining indigenous and modern methods, including drills, cranes, and welding machines. The indigenous drill currently used on the No. 9 pier site can drill nine inches of rock per day. Near the riverbank where the water is shallow, the staff uses stones, mud, and wooden boards to create cofferdams, saving steel for where it is most needed.

The technical engineers at the construction site have studied the latest Soviet advanced experience in tubular pile drilling bearing capacity. They have recently re-examined and revised the design of the pier foundation project, reducing more than ten large tubular piles and reducing the drilling depth without affecting the quality of the project. This will speed up the construction of the bridge.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 16th: Among the seventy-two piers of the new double-track bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway line, the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, the foundations of twenty-six piers have been driven to the specified elevation, and the tubular pile prefabrication project for all pier foundations is nearing completion. The workers building the bridge have vowed to seize the dry season this year, race against time, and strive to complete the bridge construction project ahead of schedule.

The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is more than 2,800 meters long and construction began in May 1958. Over the past six months, engineering technicians and workers have created many advanced bridge-building methods, accelerating the construction of the bridge. For example, it initially took 49 days to sink the tubular piles for one pier. Later, they created a construction method suitable for the Yellow River's conditions, which allowed them to sink the tubular piles for one pier in just seven or eight days. Therefore, in the two months of December last year and January this year, they completed the foundation work for twenty-four piers. If the six gantry vibratory pile drivers operate simultaneously and the north and south banks proceed at the same time, the remaining pier foundation work can be completed in two or three months.

Currently, the bridge builders are even more enthusiastic, and they have not interrupted construction even when the temperature is minus 15 degrees Celsius. They are full of confidence and determination to welcome the upcoming Yellow River dry season, ready to seize this favorable opportunity, complete all the pier foundation work, and ensure that the bridge body and bridge construction can proceed smoothly after the flood season arrives.

    南北两桥争跨长江黄河
    重庆大桥全面紧张施工　郑州大桥快建桥墩基础
    分秒必争，抢在洪水前边
    新华社重庆16日电　横跨长江的第二座铁桥——重庆白沙沱长江大桥的桥墩基础工程，已跨进全面紧张施工的阶段。正桥和跨越成渝铁路的跨线桥的十九个桥墩，已全部施工。
    筑桥工人们正在展开竞赛，决心在短短几个月的枯水季节里大干一番，抢在洪水前面，把水中的九个桥墩全部抢建出水面。原来计划2月份施工的几个水中桥墩，已提前在去年12月和今年1月份施工了。站在江岸望去，大江南北的工地上，黑压压的劳动大军正在那里奋战。水中桥墩旁边，停满了大型水上吊机、水上混凝土工厂、发电船和各种机具，一船船的大型管柱、水泥、河沙，正陆续运到桥墩旁来，把航道挤得满满的，只留有一条狭道供来往船只穿行。开始施工较早的水中三号桥墩，已经露出水面。南北两岸上的七个高大桥墩也已经耸立起来。
    这座大桥基础工程的施工方法，是采用武汉长江大桥施工中创造的最新“大型管柱钻孔法”。当修建水中三号桥墩时，在江心地层里碰到了极为坚硬的孤石。工人、干部和技术人员便共同想法改进工具和技术，终于使大型管柱通过孤石达到岩盘。1月间，在水中五号和六号桥墩下沉大型管柱时，又碰上了没有预测到的厚度达七公尺的卵石层，管柱下沉不了，也不能在岩层钻孔。筑桥工人们便用高压水泵吸出小块卵石，潜水员深入江底把大卵石块吊出水面。经过半个月的苦战，五号桥墩管柱下沉工作已接近完成。
    大桥工地的职工们除了运用现代化的施工工具以外，在最近几个月中，还制造出土洋结合的钻机、吊机、电焊机等机具四十六台。现在九号桥墩工地上使用的土钻机，每天可以钻岩九公寸。靠江岸的水较浅，职工们便用石头、泥土、木板作围堰，省出钢材来用在最需要的地方。
    工地技术工程人员学习了苏联最新的管柱钻孔承载力方面的先进经验，最近重新审查和修改了桥墩基础工程的设计，在不影响工程质量的前提下，减少了十多个大型管柱，钻孔深度也有减少，这将加速大桥的建设进度。
    新华社郑州16日电　京广路上新建的复线桥郑州黄河大桥七十二个桥墩中，已有二十六个桥墩基础打到标高，全部桥墩基础的管柱预制工程接近完成。建设大桥的工人们已经发出誓言：抓住今年的枯水季节，分秒必争，争取提前完成建桥工程。
    郑州黄河大桥的全长二千八百多公尺，从1958年5月开工建设。半年多来，工程技术人员和工人们创造了许多先进的建桥方法，加速了大桥的建设。如初次下沉一个桥墩的管柱需要四十九天，后来他们创造出适合于黄河条件的施工方法，只用七、八天就可以下沉一个桥墩的管柱，因此去年12月和今年1月两个月内，就完成了二十四个桥墩基础工程。如果现在六个龙门震动打桩机同时作业，南北两岸同时进行，目前剩下的桥墩基础工程就可能在两、三个月内全部完成。
    目前，桥梁建设者们，更加鼓足了干劲，即使在零下十五度的时候，也没有间断施工。他们正满怀信心和决心，迎接即将到来的黄河枯水季节，准备抓住这个有利时机，全部完成桥墩基础工程，保证在洪水期到来以后，桥身和桥梁工程能顺利进行。（附图片）
