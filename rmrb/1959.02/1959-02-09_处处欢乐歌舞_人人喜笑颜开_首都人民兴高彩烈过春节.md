Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Today, the capital is bathed in brilliant sunshine, the entire city immersed in the warm spring light and festive joy. People are celebrating the Great Leap Forward and the bumper harvest with great joy, and are happily celebrating the Spring Festival.

The capital is decked out in festive attire. Large red palace lanterns hang on the Tiananmen Gate tower, and a row of red flags flutter in the spring breeze. On the advertising boards on both sides of the south entrance of the famous Wangfujing Street, huge banners dozens of feet long are posted, reading "The People's Commune is Good!", "Strive to Achieve a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward!", "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!", and "Long Live World Peace!". The shop windows are filled with horizontal plaques reading "Happy Spring Festival" and "Celebrate the Great Leap Forward." The streets and alleys are clean, and people are wearing new clothes for the holiday, bustling about. The traditional market, Changdian, is especially lively this year, with a dazzling array of mass poetry and painting exhibitions for the first time. The couplets at the entrance of the exhibition read: "Bumper harvest poems, bumper harvest paintings, poems and paintings celebrate the bumper harvest; Leap Forward songs, Leap Forward dances, songs and dances celebrate the Leap Forward." There are more than 800 stalls in the market selling calligraphy, paintings, kites, windmills, sugar-coated haws, lanterns, diablos, and various traditional Beijing snacks; there are also folk art performances praising the Great Leap Forward and wonderful acrobatic performances. The famous "Clay Figure Lang" – the old artist Lang Shao'an – is also performing clay figurine making here.

Various parks have rich and colorful cultural activities, offering free admission to visitors. Taoranting Park and the Forbidden City will hold grand dances tonight. The Working People's Cultural Palace will hold a grand three-day garden party during the Spring Festival, and the Beijing Children's Palace will hold a seven-day grand get-together for children before and after the Spring Festival. Various sports fields and gymnasiums will also have various competitions and sports performances during the Spring Festival. Hundreds of thousands of workers, farmers, students, government cadres, residents, and children happily enjoyed various programs and performances in these markets, parks, and sports venues.

Many new films were shown in the capital's cinemas during the Spring Festival. The performances in various theaters during the Spring Festival were even more diverse and colorful. The China Peking Opera Theatre, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, and the China Children's Theatre gave the people of the capital new programs such as "Xiang Ma Zhuan," "Tempered into Steel," and "A Revolutionary Family." In addition to performing in theaters, the actors of these professional troupes also went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, the Miyun Reservoir, and other places to perform for workers, farmers, soldiers, and students.

The widespread mass cultural activities are one of the characteristics of this year's Spring Festival in the capital. Workers who completed their production plans for early February ahead of schedule today performed many wonderful programs. Workers and Deputy Director Deng Jinyu of the Beijing Guanghua Wood Factory performed the Peking Opera "Beating the Dragon Robe" together. The workers of Xingping Machinery Factory performed the factory history drama – the Peking Opera "Beating the False Police" and the Ping Opera "Self-Reliance," which reflects their story of starting from scratch to build a foundry. The workers of Malian Road Warehouse adapted the work chants they sang when unloading goods into the "Unloading Horn Song" and performed it during the Spring Festival. More than 40 old workers and union and workshop cadres from the Fengtai Bridge Factory went to the Huangtugang People's Commune early in the morning to pay New Year's greetings to the peasant brothers and visited the commune's 1958 Leap Forward exhibition. In the afternoon, many farmers went to the factory to watch the workers' performances. On the stadium in the residential area of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, college students from the Beijing Mining Institute held basketball, volleyball, football, and wrestling matches with the workers.

The people's communes and the bumper harvest have made the Spring Festival life of the commune members more rich and colorful. In the people's communes in the suburbs of the capital, commune members came and went, paying New Year's greetings to each other. Children wore new clothes and ran around in the crowds. The commune art troupes performed for the commune members in many places. Commune members' stilt walkers, Shaolin clubs, wheelbarrow clubs, and Taiping drums appeared on the streets one after another. On a square in the Huangtugang People's Commune, commune members built a stage and performed the Ping Opera "Suffering Gone, Sweetness Comes," which praised the superiority of the people's commune. The commune distributed wages, rice, flour, meat, and vegetables to the commune members. The Tongzhou Town People's Commune, in accordance with past customs, also distributed glutinous rice flour for the commune members to make New Year cakes. Many communes held potluck dinners on the eve of the Spring Festival, and everyone had a lively time eating dumplings together. Cadres and commune members went to the nursing homes to pay New Year's greetings to the elderly. Some commune members took food and vegetables from the commune, cooked their own meals, and had family reunions. Gao Dexian, a member of the Xiayuan Village Commune in the Chengguan People's Commune in Huairou County, had a three-generation, twenty-five-member family celebrating the festival together, and all the sons who worked outside returned. Old Gao held his little grandson in his arms, surrounded by his children, and was overjoyed to see the whole family talking and laughing.

During the Spring Festival, the people of the capital widely carried out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Today, many district and subdistrict office staff and residents beat gongs and drums to visit and comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. (Attached Picture)
