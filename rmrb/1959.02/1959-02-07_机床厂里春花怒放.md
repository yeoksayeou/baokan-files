Spring Flowers Bloom in the Machine Tool Factory
By our reporters Fan Yinhuai and Jiang Haibo

    A Sunday approaching the Spring Festival

    "Double Production" bulletins flew amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, stirring the hearts of every worker at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, making them forget that it was a Sunday approaching the Spring Festival. One bulletin from the Sixth Workshop was particularly eye-catching. It stated that the number of people in their workshop who had increased production by hundreds or thousands of times was growing.

    With excitement, we arrived at the Sixth Workshop. As soon as we entered, we bumped into a crowd of workers rushing out. They ran towards the pile of iron outside the yard, vying for shovels and baskets, hurrying to transport local steel and scrap iron filings. The workers who remained in the workshop stared intently at their lathes, seemingly oblivious to the bustling crowd.

    Looking at the attendance record on the wall, there was not a single absence. We asked Xing Zhigui, the Party Branch Secretary, why all the workers had come on a Sunday. He said in a helpless tone, "Yesterday, wages were just paid. I told everyone that the Spring Festival is approaching, and they could go to the street to buy some New Year goods. But everyone is willing to send the local iron and steel they had been refining to the processing plant as soon as possible, so it can quickly become material, and also clean up the site so we can have a clean Spring Festival; more people are keen on implementing 'Double Production', stuck to their lathes."

    At this moment, a young man pushed his way through the crowd, holding a large character poster with ink still wet, and posted it next to the milling machine group. People rushed to see it. The poster read "Sending Key Parts to the Milling Group," and stated that there were only two days left in January, and the milling group had not yet delivered the last batch of turbine parts, which might affect the assembly task. They hoped that the milling group would take emergency measures to deliver the missing parts to the fitter group before twelve o'clock noon on the 30th.

    The workers in the milling group smiled as they looked at the big character poster, seeming very confident as they each left. Hou Shourang, the Party Branch Secretary, smiled and said to the fitter group workers, "Don't worry, the milling group has it covered! Lin Junxiang milled two hundred and forty turbine parts last night." Normally, sixty of these parts were milled per shift. Everyone was surprised and delighted by this sudden increase and ran to congratulate Lin Junxiang.

    Everyone "Doubles Production"

    At the beginning of the year, the factory Party Committee proposed learning from the experience of the Harbin Machine Tool United Factory and launching a "Double Production" campaign focusing on technical innovation throughout the factory.

    While everyone was still deliberating, miller Li Jingbo began to ponder. He quickly improved a fixture on the lathe, immediately increasing efficiency fivefold. Li Jingbo had always been a cautious person, and no one had expected him to make such a big splash this time. Wang Shuwu, the section chief, immediately organized everyone to beat gongs and drums to send him a bulletin of commendation and held an on-site meeting next to his lathe. People said, "If Li Jingbo can improve it, so can we." One said he wanted to experiment too, and another said he wanted to greatly increase production. In the blink of an eye, everyone was mobilized.

    The sounds of gongs and drums sending commendation bulletins and congratulating "Double Production" achievements rose one after another. Whoever advanced first had a red flag planted on their lathe; wherever a workshop, section, or group was in the lead, an on-site meeting was held there. A few days later, the milling group, fitter group, young workers, old workers, male workers, and female workers all created excellent results. The fitter group, which had always relied on manual operation, basically achieved mechanization as master worker Kang Peiran improved the tools and increased efficiency by twelve hundred times.

    A "Flower-Fruit Mountain" bulletin board with a watercolor painting of lush branches and fruitful trees as its base, listed the names of more than thirty female workers, each with a small red flag planted next to their name. This was the Mu Guiying group, which had modified a nail-making machine and increased production by nine thousand six hundred times. Most of them were apprentices who had recently joined the factory and usually made small rivets on circular lathes. During this "Double Production" campaign, they encountered a nail-making machine in the workshop that produced wire nails. This inspired them: If this machine can make wire nails, why can't it make rivets? So they hauled out a broken nail-making machine from the warehouse and studied it every day. In a few days, they proposed a modification plan. With the help of master worker Guo Xiu, they finally succeeded in modifying it.

    The Style of a Communist Party Member

    Milling, fitting, planing, circular lathe, and other processes had all "Doubled" their production, but the boring group had put in a lot of effort without seeing much effect. Some people said: other processes deal with small tasks, which are easy to "Double"; boring machines deal with large tasks, so there is no way to "Double."

    The Sixth Process was the key for the boring group. The workshop Party Branch specifically held a meeting to ask everyone to find ways to break through this "barrier." People felt that this process was complex to operate and required high precision, and they were afraid they could not fulfill the quota, so no one expressed their opinion for a while. At this moment, Communist Party member Ma Jinshan suddenly stood up and said, "I will 'Double' the Sixth Process."

    Ma Jinshan believed that this was a glorious and arduous task. After the meeting, he discussed his high-speed boring method, which he had been pondering for a long time, with master workers and technicians. Everyone felt it made sense and asked to try it.

    The first and second attempts failed. Ma Jinshan felt somewhat heavyhearted. Section chief Wang Shuwu came to comfort him and encourage him to continue experimenting boldly. In the third experiment, the job was done, but the quality did not meet the standards. "What is this supposed to be like!" someone said mockingly. However, Ma Jinshan's perseverance was even stronger. When everyone else went home, he was still pacing back and forth next to the lathe, racking his brains for the reason for the failure. He didn't sleep well all night. The next day, he finally succeeded in the experiment, increasing efficiency by seventeen times.

    This "Double Production" campaign has opened the prelude to a greater leap forward for the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory. Recently, the factory Party Committee has summarized the "Double Production" targets and measures of each workshop and is preparing to increase the annual plan by another 100%.

    机床厂里春花怒放
    本报记者　范银怀　江海波
    临近春节的星期天
    “翻番”快报在锣鼓声中纷飞，它激荡着山西机床厂每个职工的心，使他们忘记了这是临近春节的星期天。第六车间的一张快报特别引人注意。那上面说，他们车间里生产成百倍、上千倍提高的人越来越多了。
      我们怀着兴奋的心情来到第六车间。一进门就和拥出来的工人撞了个满怀。他们一股劲儿向院外的铁堆跑去，抢锹夺筐，赶着搬运土钢和废铁屑。留在车间
  里的工人们却一个个凝神盯着车床，好像没有注意这鼎沸的人群。
    看墙上的出勤考核表，没有一个缺勤的。我们问党总支书记邢之贵，怎么星期天工人都来了。他用没有办法的
  口吻说，昨天刚发了工资，我告诉大家临近春节了，可以到街上办办年货。可是大家都愿意先把前些时候炼出来的土铁、土钢送到加工厂去，让它快快成材，同时也清理一下场地，好干干净净过春节；更多的人却是热中于“翻番”落实，粘在车床上了。
    这时候，人丛中穿出一个小伙子，拿着一张墨汁未干的大字报贴在铣工组的机床旁。人们抢着去看，上边写“向铣工组送关键”几个大字，下边说，1月份只留两天了，铣工组还没有把最后一批汽轮机零件送来，怕要影响装配任务。他们希望铣工组采取紧急措施，在30日中午十二时前把缺的零件送到钳工组。
    铣工组的工人们笑咪咪地看着大字报，好像很有把握似地各自离去了。党支部书记侯守让笑着对钳工组工人说：“你们别着急了，铣工组有底呢！人家林均祥昨天晚上铣了二百四十个汽轮机零件。”平素铣这种零件每班是六十个，现在猛增了这么多，大家都感到又惊又喜，跑去向林均祥祝贺。
    人人“翻番”
    年初，厂党委提出要学习哈尔滨机联厂的经验，在全厂开展以技术革新为内容的“翻番”运动。
    大家还在酝酿，铣工李静波就琢磨开了。他很快在车床上改进了一种夹具，效率一下子提高了五倍。李静波一向是小心翼翼的人，谁也没有想到他这次闹出这么大的名堂来。工段长王树武立即组织大家敲锣打鼓给他送喜报，在他的机床边开现场会议。人们说：“人家李静波能改成，咱们也能改。”这个说我也要试验，那个说我也要大翻番。转眼间，大家都动起来了。
    送喜报，祝贺“翻番”成绩的锣鼓声此起彼伏。谁先进就在谁的车床上插红旗；那个车间、工段、小组走在前边，就在那里开现场会议。几天以后，铣工组、钳工组，青年工、老年工、男工、女工都创造了优异的成绩。一向以手工操作为主的钳工组，由于老师傅康沛然改进了工具，效率提高了一千二百倍，全工序基本上实现了机械化。
    一幅枝叶茂密、结实累累的水彩画作底的
  “花果山”壁报，列着三十多个女工的名字，人人都插着小红旗。这就是改装了制钉机使产量提高了九千六百倍的穆桂英小组。她们绝大部分是来厂不久的学徒工，平时在圆车上制小铆钉。在这次“翻番”运动中，正遇上车间里作生产洋钉的制钉机，她们触景生智：这种机器能制洋钉就不能制铆钉吗？于是从库房里抬出一部废了的制钉机，每天围着它研究。不几天提出了改制方案。在老师傅郭秀的帮助下终于改制成功了。
    共产党员的风格
    铣工、钳工、刨工、圆车工等工序都“翻”上去了，唯独搪工组费了好大力气没有见大效果。有人说：别的工序都干的是小活，容易“翻”；搪床干的是大活，没办法“翻”。
    第六工序又是搪工组的关键。车间党支部特地召开会议，要大家想办法突破这一“关”。人们感到这道工序操作复杂，要求精密度高，怕兑现不了，一时都不表示态度。这时候，共产党员马金山猛地站起来说：“六工序我来翻。”
    马金山认为这是一项光荣而又艰巨的任务。散会以后，他便把自己老早琢磨过的高速搪车法同老师傅、技术人员一起商量。大家觉得有道理，要求试试看。
    第一次、第二次，都失败了。马金山心情有些沉重。工段长王树武赶来劝慰他鼓励他继续大胆试验。第三次试验时，活倒做成了，但是质量不合规格。“这像个什么东西！”有人在说风凉话。马金山的毅力却更加顽强。人们都回家了，他还在车床旁来回踱步，苦思失败的原因。一晚上也没有很好地睡觉。第二天，终于试验成功了，效率提高了十七倍。
    这场“翻番”运动为山西机床厂揭开了更大跃进的序幕。最近，厂党委总结了各车间“翻番”的指标和措施，准备把年计划再提高一倍。
