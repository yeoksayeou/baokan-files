　　The announcer came out and announced that the next program was the "Youth Piano Concerto."

　　Piano concerto... No, did we hear correctly? Look, the orchestral musicians on stage are changing instruments: violins are being replaced by erhus, oboes by suonas, French horns by sanxians... This is clearly a folk music ensemble!

　　However, the soloist appeared—it was him, the tall young pianist Liu Shikun who won honor for the motherland in international competitions. The erhu emitted a soft and beautiful sound, the bamboo flute played a bright melody, and the piano under his hands also joined this wonderful ensemble in a sonorous manner. The themes are several folk tunes that everyone is familiar with, but under the performance of these young musicians, the music has richer and more passionate content. I seem to hear the bold steps of youth, coming with unstoppable momentum, bursting enthusiasm, and singing tones. Ah, what a full creative passion!

　　Walking out of the theater, I thought a lot. Here, let's not talk about the success of this concerto in conception and expression techniques, and some possible rough shortcomings; what I feel deeply is the creative spirit of the authors who dare to break the routine. Instruments are a means of expression, but in the past, many comrades misinterpreted the meaning of "tool." In their view, musical instruments seem to be a tool for material production, not a tool for artistic expression; there is only a distinction between "advanced" and "backward," and no difference in national style. This view actually negates national musical instruments (because they are "backward" and "unscientific"!), separates foreign and local, and puts the two in opposition. This is the case with the views of some people in the past on the "Suona Concerto". They one-sidedly emphasized the contradictions in the pitch and negated this kind of work. The authors of the "Youth Piano Concerto" were not bound by this one-sided theory. In order to strengthen the national style of the piano, in addition to finding ways in the content and expression techniques of the music, they also consciously used national musical instruments as accompaniment. Perhaps some technical problems and pitch problems, they have not yet been able to solve perfectly this time, but the intention is good, the whole performance is successful, and technical problems will be solved perfectly in continuous practice.

　　This is not to say that future instrumental performances must be a combination of Chinese and Western, and there is no need for a pure national orchestra or symphony orchestra. The problem is not here, but in breaking the obstacles of belittling national musical instruments and separating foreign and local from the ideological point of view. Otherwise, a forced combination will also be a superficial union. It can be seen that this is not simply a matter of artistic expression, but first of all a matter of considering how art can better serve the masses. The authors of the "Youth Piano Concerto" (Liu Shikun, Huang Xiaofei, Pan Yiming, Sun Yilin) said in the dedication before the start of the music:

　　“We have an aspiration in our hearts,
　　Let the piano become a close partner of the Chinese people...
　　Let the piano express the soaring energy and happy life of our youth,
　　And infinite loyalty to the great motherland"...

　　Look, this is the most important point, this is a commendable aspiration. With this kind of aspiration, we will think of various ways to find a way to the people, and be able to use various means of expression better. This is a good start, and we look forward to the emergence of more piano concertos with national characteristics and various excellent works!

    可贵的志向
    周戊
    报幕人走出来了，她报道下一个节目是“青年钢琴协奏曲”。
    钢琴协奏曲……不，难道我们听错了么？你看，台上的管弦乐手正纷纷调换乐器：小提琴换成了二胡，双簧管换成了唢呐，法国号换成了三弦……这分明是一阕民间音乐大合奏嘛！　　然而，独奏者出台了——是他，是那身材高高的、曾在国际比赛中为祖国获得荣誉的青年钢琴家刘诗昆。二胡发出柔美的声音，竹笛吹着嘹亮的曲调，钢琴在他双手下也铿锵地加入了这个美妙的合奏。主题是大家都很熟悉的几个民间曲调，但在这些青年乐手们的演奏下，音乐有了更丰富、更激情的内容。我仿佛听到那豪迈的青春的脚步，以不可阻遏的气势、勃发的热情和欢唱的音调动地而来。啊，多么饱满的创造热情！
    走出剧场，心中想得很多。这里且不说这首协奏曲在构思和表现手法上得到的成功，和可能存在的一些粗略的缺点；使我感受很深的是作者们敢于打破常规的创造精神。乐器，是一种表现工具，但过去好多同志曲解了“工具”的意义。在他们看来，乐器好像是一种物质生产的工具，而不是艺术表现的工具；只有“先进”与“落后”之分，没有民族风格之别。这种看法，实际上是否定民族乐器（因为它“落后”、“不科学”呀！），使洋土分家，把二者摆在对立的位置上。像过去有些人对“唢呐协奏曲”的看法就是这样，他们片面强调音律上的矛盾而否定这种风格的作品。“青年钢琴协奏曲”的作者们并没有受这种片面论的束缚，他们为了加强钢琴的民族风格，除了在乐曲内容及表现手法上想办法以外，同时又有意识地用民族乐器担任伴奏。也许有些演奏技术上的问题和音律问题，他们这一次也还未能完满地解决，但这意图是好的，整个演出是成功的，技术问题会在不断实践中完满解决的。
    这倒不是说，以后的器乐演奏都必须是中西合璧，不必有单纯的民族乐队或管弦乐队。问题不在这里，而在于从思想上打破轻视民族乐器和洋土分家的障碍，否则，勉强结合也会貌合神离。由此可见，这还不单纯是一种艺术表现方法问题，而是首先考虑艺术怎样才能为群众服务得更好的问题。“青年钢琴协奏曲”的作者们（刘诗昆、黄晓飞、潘亦明、孙亦林）在乐曲开始前的献词中说：
    “在我们心里有一个志向，
    让钢琴成为中国人民的亲密伙伴……
    让钢琴表达我们青年的冲天干劲、愉快的生活，
    和对伟大祖国的无比忠诚”……
    看，这是最重要的一点，这是一种可贵的志向。有了这种志向，才会去想种种办法寻找通向人民的道路，才能更好地去使用各种表现工具。这是一个很好的开始，我们期待更多的民族风格的钢琴协奏曲和各种各样的优秀作品出现！
