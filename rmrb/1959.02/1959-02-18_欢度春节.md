Celebrating the Spring Festival
Chen Yi

Comrade Lin Lao spent the Spring Festival in Guangzhou, visiting the flower markets, and wrote a poem to commemorate the event. The last line of the poem reads, "The scenery is especially beautiful this year, a riot of color announces the spring." One can imagine the grandeur of the Spring Festival in Guangzhou. I believe the Spring Festival in Beijing is also grander than in the past, and the same is true throughout the country. I am writing a poem to celebrate the Spring Festival, to briefly reflect the grand occasion of this great holiday.

February 10, 1959, Beijing

On Lunar New Year's Eve, we ate our New Year's dinner, family and friends gathered around, engaging in gentle conversation. We sipped and tasted our drinks, the flavor of the local Daqu liquor, still spicy yet sweet. We recalled the past and all said: Time really flies, and China's progress is so fast, it has advanced from a semi-feudal society to the People's Commune in less than fifty years! We talked and drank, and everyone became a little tipsy. The lanterns seemed redder, the wine poured fuller, it seemed the night was deep, and the party was about to end. Suddenly, firecrackers sounded in the courtyard, and everyone ran to watch. The children were so happy, their laughter and the sound of firecrackers, played together, resounding through the sky. The smell of gunpowder sobered us up a little, and everyone said: This kind of childhood joy of celebrating the New Year, brings us straight back to decades ago!

On the first day of the Spring Festival, we visited the Summer Palace. We had lunch with some foreign guests, and in the evening, we celebrated the holiday with many foreign friends, a grand gathering of Chinese and foreigners. We watched Peking Opera, acrobatics, and listened to folk arts, truly a blossoming of a hundred flowers, with cheers filling the seats. Many comrades couldn't help but dance to the music, a foreign friend said: You are not nervous at all, your enthusiasm is really great. I said: You wouldn't object if our party went on all night. The tension of the Great Leap Forward is very different from that of wartime, there are no difficulties we cannot overcome.

Even on the second day of the Spring Festival holiday, there were still some tasks that needed to be handled. After finishing the work, we went to a friend's place for a dinner party. Everyone talked about the Northern Expedition, everyone talked about the stalemate phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan, everyone talked about the three years of the People's Liberation War, everyone talked about last year's Great Leap Forward, everyone also counted our relatives and old friends, who survived and who died? It is a pity they are not with us. Finally, everyone toasted together, for "Liberating Taiwan"!

On the third day of the Spring Festival, we went to visit the television broadcasting station, the interior of the broadcasting building is even better than its exterior. Modern architecture, new mechanical equipment, going up and down the stairs, it was truly dazzling to see. Thirty-six kinds of Chinese folk arts were performed for us, and someone also recited modern poems. Someone asked me what I thought after the visit, I said: Seeing that the hundreds of cadres are all very young, you can serve the people for at least a few more decades. Please listen to my words: The foundation of great learning, is often laid in youth.

After the Spring Festival, we started working. Everyone said when they met: This Spring Festival was really not bad. Everyone must work hard. Everyone made a vow: "We will adhere to the four major indicators of steel, grain, coal, and cotton, to drive the overall progress of industry and agriculture. The whole Party and the whole people will make a Great Leap Forward, creating our own heaven. We will go all out, and fight another beautiful victory, this year's leap forward will surpass last year's."

    欢度春节
    陈毅
    林老在广州过春节，游花市，有诗以纪其事。诗末句云“正是今年风景美，千红万紫报春光。”想见广州春节之盛。余谓北京春节亦大盛于往昔，全国各地莫不如此。特写欢度春节一诗，略略反映大节日之盛况。                                                            
      一九五九年二月十日于北京我们在农历除夕吃年饭，亲友们团团围坐，娓娓清谈。我们浅斟低酌的喝酒，家乡的大曲酒风味，依旧带辛辣又回甜。我们回忆往事都说：时间真是过得快，中国进步也真快，它从半封建社会，进到人民公社还不到五十年！我们边谈边喝，大家都有些醉意。看灯更红，看酒斟得更满，似乎夜已深，席要散。突然院内响起了爆竹，大家跑去围观。儿童们真高兴，他们的笑声与鞭炮声，合奏起来，响彻云天。硝药味把我们的酒醒了一半，大家都说：这样过年的儿时欢乐，直把我们带回到数十年前！春节第一天我们游颐和园。陪几个外宾吃午饭，晚上与许多外国朋友过节，来了一个中外大团圆。看京戏，看杂技，听曲艺，真正是百花齐放，满座欢颜。许多同志不自禁地随着音乐翩翩起舞，一个外国朋友说：你一点也不紧张，你们的兴致真不错。我说：你不反对我们的晚会可以通宵达旦。大跃进的紧张与战争时期大不相同，我们没有什么克服不了的困难。春节第二天纵然是假期，也有几件工作需要处理。把工作做完，便到一家朋友处去聚餐。大家谈北伐战争，大家谈抗日战争的相持阶段，大家谈三年人民解放战争，大家谈去年的大跃进，大家又历数亲旧，谁存谁亡？可惜他们不在我们跟前。最后大家共同干一杯酒，为了“解放台湾”！春节第三天我们去参观电视广播台，广播大楼内部比它的外表还更好看。现代化的建筑，新式的机械设备，上楼下楼，真是令人看得头晕目眩。卅六种中国曲艺为我们演奏，还有人朗诵了现代的诗篇。有人问我参观后有何感想，我说：看大家几百个干部年纪都很轻，你们至少还可以为人民服务几十年。请听我的话：大学问的基础，每每奠定于少年。过完了春节，我们开始工作。大家见面不约而同的说：这一次春节真过得不坏。大家要好好地工作。大家立下誓言：“我们坚持钢粮煤棉四大指标，带动工农业的全盘。全党全民大跃进，自己创造自己的天。我们鼓足干劲，再打一个漂亮的胜仗，今年跃进胜去年。”
