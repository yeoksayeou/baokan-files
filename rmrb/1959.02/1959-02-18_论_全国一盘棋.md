    On "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard"
    柯庆施
    Annual Great Leap Forward, better every year – this is the aspiration of China's working people. 1959 is the decisive year in the "Three Years of Hard Struggle." The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, building upon the glorious achievements and rich experience of 1958, set the Great Leap Forward targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and determined that socialist construction in 1959 would continue to develop at a high speed and on a grand scale. Now, the Great Leap Forward of 1959 has already shown its early promise. The task for the entire Party and all the people is to continue to exert all our strength, strive for the upstream, continue to oppose conservatism and break down superstition, and redouble our efforts to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the relevant set of policies of walking on two legs. We must adhere to the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," fully combine centralized leadership with decentralized management, and fully combine the strength of the central government with the strength of the localities, and the strength of the state with the strength of the masses. The entire Party and all the people should work together to ensure the successful realization of this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan, and strive to overfulfill it.

    The principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" is not a new issue. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always taught us that whether we are engaged in class struggle or production struggle, whether we are doing any kind of work, making plans, handling affairs, or thinking about problems, we must have a global perspective, we must proceed from the basis of 600 million people, and we must correctly handle the relationship between the whole and the part, between the key and the general, and between centralized leadership and decentralized management. In terms of economic construction, our Party, based on the objective laws of economic development in socialist society, has stipulated the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy and light industry, simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large and small-medium sized enterprises, simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous methods of production, combining taking steel as the key link with a comprehensive leap forward in the current period, and combining centralized leadership with launching mass movements on a large scale – in short, the policy of walking on two legs. This whole set of policies correctly embodies the relationship between the various sectors of the national economy, between the whole and the part, and demonstrates that they are interconnected as "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," rather than a heap of loose sand. At the same time, only in this way can we avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another. The great practice of 1958 proved that the Party's general line for socialist construction and its entire set of policies are completely correct, and we must continue to implement them.

    Of course, with the rapid development of the national economy, the speed and proportion of development in various regions and various economic sectors need to be adjusted and arranged specifically at any time. This requires properly handling the different aspects of primary and secondary, priority and sequence, importance and unimportance, urgency and non-urgency, according to the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard." Among them, the scale of national capital construction, the output of major products, and the allocation of raw materials and major materials of the two categories (means of production and means of subsistence) must, under any circumstances, be arranged uniformly by the whole country.

    As everyone knows, in military struggles, it is necessary to concentrate superior forces to win major battles in order to resolve the question of who will win and who will lose between the enemy and ourselves. In the same vein, in economic work, only by planning the overall situation, concentrating manpower, materials, and financial resources according to the plan of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," and ensuring that key construction projects are successfully completed can we solve the question of whether or not we can achieve a greater leap forward. The success or failure of key construction projects not only affects the victory or defeat of the overall situation, but also affects the fate of each part. If the overall situation is not handled well, the local situation cannot be handled well either; if the overall situation is victorious, the problems of the local situation will be easily solved. Especially in a large country like ours, with a thin foundation and the requirement to develop the national economy at a high speed, we must first concentrate the use of manpower, materials, and financial resources on the aspects that are most critical to the overall situation, and we must never disperse our forces. Whatever should be done first must be done first, and whatever should give way in necessary circumstances and can give way must give way. Anything that can be postponed should be postponed. We should recognize that the national economic plan formulated according to the spirit of distinguishing between primary and secondary, priority and sequence, importance and unimportance, urgency and non-urgency is necessary for the high-speed development of the national economy. If we use our forces evenly, without distinguishing between primary and secondary, priority and sequence, importance and unimportance, or reversing them, it will be impossible to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and it may even lead to the entire economic work losing its direction and the danger of economic imbalances. We absolutely cannot allow such imbalances to occur. As for when the "marshal" ascends to command and the "pioneers" march forward, while the secondary and subsequent aspects, if some things that should not be squeezed out are squeezed out due to temporary insufficient attention, some phenomena of maladaptation may occur, and this situation should also be prevented or adjusted in time. However, these individual and temporary phenomena of maladaptation are not to be feared, and we must not ignore the interests of the whole and the overall situation and unilaterally emphasize the local needs of each region and each department because of this.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once told us: These things that are related to the overall situation cannot be seen with the eyes, and can only be understood by thinking with the mind. If we do not think with the mind, we will not understand. Some of our comrades, when making plans, handling affairs, and thinking about problems, are often not good at proceeding from the overall perspective of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," and cannot connect today's interests with tomorrow's interests, or partial interests with overall interests. The reason for this is rooted in cognition: there is too little dialectics and too much metaphysics in their minds, so they are not good at thinking with the mind. The characteristic of metaphysics is to look at problems in isolation and one-sidedly, not to see things as interconnected, but as unrelated; to look at problems from superficial phenomena, not from essence; to look at problems from form, not from content; to look at problems statically, not developmentally. People who look at problems from a metaphysical point of view are blind to the big picture and cannot easily correctly understand and handle the relationship between the small picture and the big picture, the key and the general, and it is difficult to understand that they are opposed to each other and yet unified, that they are mutually contradictory and yet mutually promoting; it is also difficult to understand that the big picture and the key are generally the main aspects of the contradiction, and only by grasping the main aspects of the contradiction can the contradiction be resolved. The following two questions are difficult to think through using a metaphysical way of thinking.

    One question is: Does advocating the viewpoint of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" limit the initiative of localities and the initiative of various departments? From a metaphysical point of view, the country is the country, the localities are the localities, and the two are unrelated. However, we know that things related to the overall situation cannot be separated from the local and exist independently; the overall situation is composed of all its parts. The unified national economic plan, that is, the plan of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," is a global thing that unifies the initiative and flexibility of the central government with that of the localities and various departments. The completion of the unified national economic plan depends on the efforts of various regions and departments. The whole country is like a large symphony orchestra, the central government is the conductor, and the various regions and departments are like the musicians of this orchestra; the unified national economic plan is like a symphonic movement, and the various regions and departments are like a section, a segment, or a kind of instrument in this great movement. To complete the unified national economic plan is like playing this great movement, which requires all the musicians of the country to use their instruments and display their skills under the general command. If you don't listen to the command and don't play according to the movement, the performance will fail; without the individual efforts and collective cooperation of the musicians, the performance will also fail. When have we ever heard of a violinist or other musician having his talent limited just because he listened to the conductor and played according to the movement? The opposite is true: "Without rules, nothing can be accomplished." It is precisely because of listening to the command and playing according to the movement that it is easier to express and improve their special skills and make the performance a success. The scale of our country's Great Leap Forward this year is so grand that it is very urgent for various regions and departments to fully exert their initiative and show their abilities; just as a good director and a wonderful script require excellent actors, a good conductor and a wonderful movement require excellent musicians. However, there are two kinds of initiative: one is the initiative that conforms to the general line of socialist construction and the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," proceeds from the whole, combines the national unified plan with the local actual situation, further exerts all our strength, strives to create favorable conditions, overcomes all difficulties, and tries every possible means to strive to overfulfill the economic tasks assigned by the state. The other is the so-called "initiative" that deviates from the general line of socialist construction, violates the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," and only cares about the small picture without caring about the big picture, which is actually blind action. The former kind of initiative is the greater the better, while the latter kind of blind action should be avoided and overcome.

    Is it that the initiative of localities and departments has no room to unleash potential other than implementing the national plan? No. Our national plan was originally formulated in accordance with the principle of simultaneously developing central and local industries; therefore, various regions not only have many things within the national plan that need to be handled proactively and in accordance with local conditions, but also outside the scope of the national plan, as long as it does not harm the overall situation and they have the spare capacity to run undertakings, they can still run them. Key projects are like tree trunks, and general projects are like tree branches. We oppose the practice of strengthening the branches at the expense of the trunk, but as long as it does not hinder the growth of the tree trunk, it is of course not bad for the branches and leaves to be lush.

    Another question is: Does advocating the thought of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" mean that there is no flexibility for localities and various departments? Unity and flexibility are not unrelated, but mutually dependent. At the same time, economic life is very complex, and our experience is not enough. Any economic plan can only reflect the main aspects of objective economic life, and it is impossible to stipulate it very thoroughly or consider it completely. Moreover, objective economic life is constantly moving forward, and new problems that were unexpected when the plan was formulated will inevitably appear. This requires the flexibility of localities and various departments, giving play to the initiative of localities and various departments to deal with problems not considered in the national unified plan and to supplement the deficiencies of the national unified plan. Therefore, flexibility must serve unity and must be subordinate to unity. Otherwise, it will develop departmentalism and decentralism, hinder the cause of socialist construction, and cause extremely serious consequences. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once told us in his political report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The great development of local industries and small and medium-sized enterprises will inevitably bring many new problems that are difficult for us to predict now. Here, it is necessary to especially point out that the development of local industries and small and medium-sized enterprises that we advocate is the development under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, and not blind and free competition. In order to prevent and reduce possible waste of resources and funds and the stockpiling of products, the central and local levels must conscientiously strengthen the work of coordination and balance, and must resolutely oppose capitalist business thinking and the tendencies of localism and departmentalism."

    Whether or not one has the idea of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," or whether one has it enough, has serious significance for every Communist Party member, and this is a question of testing the strength or weakness of every Communist Party member's Party spirit. As everyone knows, we Communist Party members are advanced fighters of the proletariat and should be concrete representatives of the interests of the Party and the class. The Party is the leader of socialist economic construction, and the unified plan of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" is precisely the characteristic of the socialist economy. To be mindful of the overall situation and take care of the big picture is a communist quality that Party members should possess. The higher a Communist Party member's class consciousness and the firmer his class stance, the more selfless and far-sighted he will naturally be, and he will observe, analyze, and handle problems with the idea of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" and give full play to his role. Conversely, he will become a shortsighted person who sees the trees but not the forest, and dangerous departmentalism and decentralism will grow. This is something to be wary of.

    Recently, after the Shanghai municipal Party organization conveyed the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Shanghai Municipal Party, cadres are enthusiastically discussing the issue of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard." In the preliminary discussions, many comrades criticized some phenomena of departmentalism that disregarded the overall situation, and initially realized that violating the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" in thought and action not only prevents people from making the best use of their talents, prevents things from being used to their fullest extent, and prevents goods from flowing smoothly, hindering the country's socialist construction, but also opens the door wide for the erosion of cadres by bourgeois ideology. We believe that carrying out this discussion in depth is very beneficial to the work of Shanghai.

    Shanghai is one of China's important industrial bases. In the national unified plan for the whole year, Shanghai undertakes the arduous and glorious task of supporting national construction. Education on the thought of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard" is urgently needed to be strengthened for all cadres in Shanghai. All cadres in Shanghai must understand that the raw materials for Shanghai's industrial production and the means of livelihood needed for the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of urban people mainly rely on the support and supply from all parts of the country. Without the support from all parts of the country, Shanghai would be unable to move an inch. However, the supply of raw materials in various parts of the country is still tight, and we must try every possible means to save raw materials and manufacture substitutes in order to reduce the burden on various parts of the country and prevent and overcome the lazy attitude of simply relying on various parts of the country. Completing the national plan is the greatest interest of the people of Shanghai. In addition to resolutely ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks assigned by the state, Shanghai must also provide more and better support to various parts of the country in terms of materials, technology, and funds in accordance with the unified regulations of the state. In short, under the unified leadership of the Central Committee, Shanghai and various parts of the country must carry out more extensive and closer communist cooperation, and work together to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's Great Leap Forward plan.

    论“全国一盘棋”
    柯庆施
    年年大跃进，一年胜一年，这是我国劳动人民的愿望。1959年是“苦战三年”中有决定意义的一年。党的八届六中全会在总结1958年的辉煌成就和丰富经验的基础上，确定了钢、煤、粮、棉的四大跃进指标，和1959年社会主义建设继续用高速度发展的伟大规模。现在，1959年大跃进已经春云初展，全党全民的任务就是：继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，继续反对保守、破除迷信，再接再厉地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和有关的一整套用两条腿走路的方针，坚持“全国一盘棋”的方针，把集中领导和分级管理充分地结合起来，把中央的力量和地方的力量、国家的力量和群众的力量充分地结合起来，全党全民一致努力，保证今年更大更好更全面的跃进计划胜利实现，而且力争超额完成。
    全国一盘棋的方针，并不是新问题。党中央和毛泽东同志历来教导我们，不管是进行阶级斗争或者生产斗争，不管是做哪种工作，作计划、办事情、想问题，都要有全局观点，都要从六亿人口出发，都要正确处理全局和局部的关系，重点和一般的关系，集中领导和分级管理的关系。在经济建设方面，我们党依据社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律，规定了在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举、在目前时期以钢为纲和全面跃进相结合以及集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，一句话，用两条腿走路的方针。这一整套方针，正确地体现了国民经济各部门之间、全体和局部之间的关系，说明了它们是互相联系的全国一盘棋，而不是一盘散沙。同时，也只有如此，才不至于顾此失彼。1958年的伟大实践，证明了党的社会主义建设总路线和它的这一整套方针是完全正确的，我们必须继续贯彻执行。
    当然，随着国民经济的飞跃发展，各个地区、各个经济部门发展的速度和比例，需要随时具体调整和安排。这就必须分别主从、先后、轻重、缓急的不同，依照全国一盘棋的方针妥善处理。其中，全国基本建设的规模，主要产品的产量，以及原材料和两个部类（生产资料和生活资料）主要物资的分配，在任何情况下，都必须由全国来统一安排。
    大家知道，在军事斗争中，必须集中优势兵力，打胜主要战役，才能解决敌我两方谁胜谁负的问题。同样的道理，在经济工作中，也只有统筹全局，按照全国一盘棋的计划，集中人力、物力、财力，保证重点建设过关，才可以解决能不能更大跃进的问题。重点建设的成败，不仅关系到全局的胜负，并且也影响到各个局部的命运。大局搞不好，小局也不可能搞好；大局胜利了，小局的问题也就容易解决了。特别是在我们这样一个大国，底子很薄，要求高速度地发展国民经济，必须首先集中使用人力、物力、财力于最关全局的方面，绝不能分散力量。凡是应该先行的必须先行，而在必要的情况下应该让路而又可能让路的则必须让路。可缓办的一律缓办。我们应该认识到，根据分别主从、先后、轻重、缓急的精神制订的国民经济计划，正是高速度发展国民经济所必需的。如果平均使用力量，主从、先后、轻重、缓急不分或者倒置，就不可能多快好省地建设社会主义，甚至会使整个经济工作迷失方向，出现经济失调的危险。我们绝对不能允许这种失调的现象发生。至于“元帅”升帐了，“先行官”进军了，而次要的、后行的方面，如果由于一时照顾不够，挤掉了一些不应该挤掉的，也会发生若干不适应的现象，这种情况也应该及早防止或者及时调整。但是这种个别的暂时的不适应现象，并不可怕，决不能因此而忽视全局和整体的利益，片面强调各个地方和各个部门的局部需要。
    毛泽东同志曾经告诉我们：这种全局性的东西，眼睛看不见，只能用心思去想一想才能懂得，不用心思去想，就不会懂得。我们的一些同志，作计划、办事情、想问题，往往不善于从全国一盘棋的全局观点出发，不能把今天利益同明天利益、部分利益同整体利益相联结。其所以如此，是有认识根源的，这就是：头脑里的辩证法太少，形而上学太多，因而不善于用心思去想。形而上学的特点是：孤立地、片面地看问题，不把事物看成是相互联系的，而看作是互不相干的；从表面现象看问题，不从本质看问题；从形式看问题，不从内容看问题；静止地看问题，不是发展地看问题。用形而上学观点看问题的人，一叶蔽目，不知有天，很难正确地理解和处理小局和大局、重点和一般的关系，很难懂得它们是对立而又统一的，是互相矛盾而又互相促进的；也很难懂得，大局和重点一般说来总是矛盾的主要方面，只有抓住矛盾的主要方面才能解决矛盾。下列两个问题，就是用形而上学思想方法很难想通的问题。
    一个问题是：提倡全国一盘棋的观点，是不是限制了地方的积极性和各部门的积极性的发挥？从形而上学的观点来看，全国自全国，地方自地方，两者互不相干。然而，我们知道，全局性的东西不能脱离局部而独立，全局是由它的一切局部构成的。全国的统一经济计划，即全国一盘棋的计划，是把中央同地方和各部门的积极性、机动性统一起来的全局性的东西。全国的统一经济计划的完成，正有赖于各个地方和各个部门的努力。全国好比是一个大交响乐团，中央是指挥，各个地方和各个部门好比是这个乐团的乐手；全国的统一经济计划好比是一部交响乐乐章，各个地方和各个部门好比是这个大乐章中的一段、一节或是乐器中的一种。完成全国的统一经济计划，正同演奏这个大乐章一样，需要全国各个乐手在总的指挥之下，运用自己的乐器和发挥自己的技巧。不听指挥，不按乐章演奏，演出是要失败的；没有各个乐手的各自的努力和共同的配合，演出也同样是要失败的。我们几时听见过提琴手或者其他乐手，只是由于听指挥、按乐章演奏，使得他的才能受了限制的事情呢？事实恰恰相反，“不以规矩不能成方圆”，正是由于听指挥、按乐章演奏，才更易于表现和提高他们的特长，使演出得到成功。我们国家今年的大跃进规模如此宏大，非常迫切地需要各个地方和各个部门充分发挥积极性，各显神通；正如有了高明的导演、精彩的剧本，还需要优秀的演员，有了高明的指挥、精彩的乐章，还需要优秀的乐手一样。但是，积极性有两种：一种是符合社会主义建设总路线和全国一盘棋原则的积极性，从整体出发，把国家统一计划和当地实际情况结合起来，更加鼓足干劲，努力创造有利条件，克服一切困难，千方百计地力争超额完成国家赋予的经济任务。一种是脱离社会主义建设总路线、违背全国一盘棋的原则、只顾小局不顾大局的所谓“积极性”，实即盲动性。前一种积极性越大越好，后一种盲动性，则应该避免和克服。
    是不是地方和部门的积极性，除了执行国家计划以外，就没有可能发挥潜力的余地呢？不是的。我们的国家计划本来就是根据中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针制定的；因此，各个地方不仅在国家计划之内，有很多事情，需要因地制宜、积极主动地办理，就是在国家计划范围之外，只要无损于全局，而自己又有余力兴办的事业，也还可以兴办。重点项目如树干，一般项目是树枝，我们反对强枝弱干的做法，但是，只要不碍于树干的成长，枝叶茂盛当然并没有什么不好。
    另一个问题是：提倡全国一盘棋的思想，是不是地方的和各部门的机动就没有了？统一和机动，不是互不相干的，而是互相依赖的。同时，经济生活很复杂，我们的经验又不够，任何一个经济计划只能反映出客观经济生活的主要的诸方面，不可能规定得十分周到、考虑得完备无缺。何况客观的经济生活是不断向前发展的，必然会出现在制订计划时所料想不到的新问题。这就必须有地方和各部门的机动，发挥地方和各部门的主动性，来处理国家统一计划中所未考虑到的问题，补充国家统一计划之不足。所以，机动必须是为统一服务的，必须服从于统一。反之，就会发展本位主义、分散主义，妨害社会主义建设事业，造成异常严重的恶果。刘少奇同志在党的八届二次会议的政治报告中，曾经告诉我们：“地方工业的大发展，中小企业的大发展，必然带来许多新的我们现在还难于预料的问题。在这里需要特别指出：我们所提倡的地方工业和中小企业的发展，是在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下的发展，而不是盲目的、自由竞争的发展。为了防止和减少可能的资源资金的浪费和产品的积压，中央和地方各级都必须认真地加强协作和平衡的工作，必须坚决反对资本主义的经营思想和地方主义、本位主义的倾向。”
    全国一盘棋的思想有没有，或者够不够，对于每一个共产党员来说，具有严重的意义，这是考验每一个共产党员党性强弱的问题。大家知道，我们共产党员是无产阶级的先进战士，应该是党和阶级的利益的具体代表者。党是社会主义经济建设的领导者，而全国一盘棋的统一计划，正是社会主义经济的特点。识大体、顾大局，是党员应该具有的共产主义品质。一个共产党员的阶级觉悟愈高，阶级立场愈坚定，自然会大公无私，高瞻远瞩，用全国一盘棋的思想观察、分析和处理问题，充分发挥自己的作用。反之，就会变成鼠目寸光，见树不见林的人，就会滋长危险的本位主义、分散主义。这是值得警惕的。
    最近，上海市党组织在传达了党的八届六中全会精神和上海市党的二届代表大会决议之后，干部中正在热烈讨论全国一盘棋的问题。在初步讨论中，许多同志批判了一些不顾大局的本位主义的现象，并且初步认识到，在思想和行动中违背全国一盘棋的原则，不仅人不能尽其才，物不能尽其用，货不能畅其流，妨碍国家的社会主义建设，而且也为资产阶级思想对干部的侵蚀大开方便之门。我们认为，深入开展这一讨论，对于上海的工作是很有好处的。
    上海是我国的重要工业基地之一。在全年的国家的统一计划中，上海担任着支援国家建设的艰巨而又光荣的任务。全国一盘棋的思想教育，对于上海全体干部是迫切需要加强的。上海全体干部必须了解，上海工业生产的原材料和城市人民衣食所需的生活资料，主要是依靠全国各地的支援和供应，没有全国各地的支援，上海是寸步难行的。但是，现在全国各地的原材料供应还是紧张的，我们必须千方百计地节约原料、制造代用品，以便减少全国各地的负担，防止和克服单纯依赖各地的懒汉作风。完成国家计划，是上海人民的最大利益。上海除了必须坚决地保证完成和超额完成国家赋予的任务以外，还要根据国家的统一规定，在物资、技术、资金等方面更多更好地支援全国各地。总之，在中央的统一领导下，上海和全国各地必须更加广泛、更加紧密地开展共产主义的大协作，同心协力地为完成和超额完成今年的大跃进计划而斗争。
