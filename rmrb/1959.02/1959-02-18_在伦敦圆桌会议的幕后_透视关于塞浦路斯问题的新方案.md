    Behind the London Round Table Conference
    —A Perspective on the New Proposal for the Cyprus Issue
    By our reporter Pan Fei
    The round table conference discussing the Cyprus issue began in London on the 17th. Attending the conference were the foreign ministers of Britain, Greece, and Turkey, as well as Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus. Macmillan and the prime ministers of Greece and Turkey will also participate in the talks. The British government hopes that this conference will resolve this very thorny issue "once and for all."
    The basis for discussion at this conference is a proposal put forward by Greece and Turkey after consultations in Zurich, Switzerland. The full text of the proposal has not yet been published. According to British newspapers, the main contents are: First, Cyprus will become an "independent state" after a certain period, and it is guaranteed that it will not merge with Greece; second, Britain will retain several military bases on the island, and the sovereignty of these bases belongs to Britain; third, Greece and Turkey will send an equal number of troops to Cyprus; fourth, 70% of the Cypriot parliamentarians will be elected from the local Greek population, and 30% from the Turkish population; fifth, the President of Cyprus will be a local Greek, and the Vice President will be a Turk, and the decrees issued by the President must be signed by the Vice President to take effect.
    The Zurich proposal is said to be the product of a compromise between Greece and Turkey. In fact, it is clear that this is the result of US intervention. London's "Observer" wrote: "The United States forced both sides [Greece and Turkey] to reach an agreement; it exerted considerable force privately while the Cyprus issue was being debated at the United Nations." It should be added that the United States not only put pressure on Greece and Turkey, but also on Britain; not only when the United Nations was meeting, but also when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held its meeting in Paris. The United States saw that Britain was unable to cope with the Cyprus issue and had long coveted this strategic base in the Mediterranean. The United States hopes that an "independent" Cyprus will become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And a Cyprus controlled by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is in fact a Cyprus controlled by the United States, or at least it will gradually become a Cyprus controlled by the United States. It is precisely because of this reason that as soon as the content of the Zurich proposal was revealed, some members of the British Conservative Party (mainly the so-called "Suez Group") jumped up in anxiety, criticizing the Macmillan government: this is "surrender" and "betrayal."
    The purpose of American intervention in the Cyprus issue is not only to gradually replace Britain's position on the island. It also wants to revive the Balkan military alliance composed of Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia (this alliance has been on the verge of collapse in recent years due to the sharp conflict between Greece and Turkey over the Cyprus issue). Undoubtedly, the Tito group will be assigned a certain role in this conspiracy. The "Manchester Guardian" editorial wrote: Tito will visit Athens soon. This visit "is not only of a social nature; in 1954, Yugoslavia joined the Balkan alliance of Greece and Turkey... The restoration of friendship between Greece and Turkey may be attractive to President Tito."
    The British government has welcomed the Zurich proposal. This shows that the Conservative government's plan to forcibly implement the partition of Cyprus for several months has gone bankrupt, and it now has to resort to another approach. Of course, the Zurich proposal still maintains the basic spirit of the partition plan, and according to this proposal, Britain also retains its control over the military bases on the island. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd recently stated in the House of Commons that Britain would never give up its sovereignty over the military bases. It should also be noted that the entry of Greek and Turkish troops into Cyprus has planted the seeds of new conflicts. In the eyes of the British ruling group, this possible conflict is a factor in maintaining its interests in Cyprus.
    The British government's agreement to discuss the Zurich proposal is an attempt to achieve its own purposes. What are its purposes? The "Sunday Times" put it very frankly: first, to consolidate internally; second, to prevent Cyprus from "heading towards revolution, or civil war and chaos"; and third, to ensure that Britain maintains its military bases in Cyprus. Apart from the first point, which is a bit of a formality, the rest are heartfelt words. In short, it is to try to divide the Cypriot people and quell (or at least weaken) their resistance to British colonial rule, thereby maintaining Britain's privileges on the island and making it continue to be an outpost for suppressing the national liberation movement in the Middle East.
    But past facts have proven that the root cause of Britain's inability to settle down in Cyprus and the sharp conflict between Britain and the Cypriot people is that the Cypriot people demand genuine independence. However, the Zurich proposal is just another colonial plan. Under the guise of letting Cyprus "become independent", it not only maintains Britain's control over the island, but also wants to turn it into a military base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is of course completely contrary to the wishes of the Cypriot people. It is obviously wishful thinking that US and British imperialism, colluding to impose this colonial plan on the Cypriot people, will not arouse the opposition of the Cypriot people.

### 在伦敦圆桌会议的幕后——透视关于塞浦路斯问题的新方案

    在伦敦圆桌会议的幕后
    ——透视关于塞浦路斯问题的新方案
    本报记者　潘非
    讨论塞浦路斯问题的圆桌会议，17日起在伦敦举行。出席会议的有英国、希腊、土耳其三国外长和塞浦路斯的马卡里奥斯大主教。麦克米伦和希腊、土耳其的总理，也将参与会谈。英国政府希望经过这次会议，能“一劳永逸”地解决这个十分棘手的问题。
    作为这次会议讨论的基础的，是希腊和土耳其双方在瑞士苏黎世协商后提出的一个方案。方案全文尚未公布，根据英国报纸的透露，主要内容是：一、塞浦路斯在经过一定时期后，成为一个“独立国家”，并保证不与希腊合并；二、英国在岛上保留若干军事基地，而且这些基地的主权属于英国；三、希腊和土耳其将派遣同等数目的军队前往塞浦路斯；四、塞浦路斯的议员，70％由当地希腊人中选出，30％由土耳其人中选出；五、塞浦路斯的总统由当地希腊人担任，副总统由土耳其人担任，总统颁布的法令，均应由副总统签署方能生效。
    苏黎世方案被说成是希腊和土耳其两国妥协的产物。实际上很明显，这是美国插手干预的结果。伦敦的“观察家报”写道：“美国迫使（希腊和土耳其）双方达成协议；在联合国辩论塞浦路斯问题时，曾经用相当的力量，私下施加这种压力。”应该补充的是：美国不仅对希腊和土耳其施加压力，而且也对英国施加压力；不仅在联合国开会的时候，而且也在北大西洋集团举行巴黎会议的时候。美国看准英国对塞浦路斯问题难以应付，对地中海的这一战略基地，早已垂涎已久。美国希望“独立”后的塞浦路斯能成为在北大西洋集团的一员。而北大西洋集团控制下的塞浦路斯，事实上就是美国控制下的塞浦路斯，至少它会逐步变成美国控制下的塞浦路斯。正是因为这个缘故，所以一当苏黎世方案的内容透露以后，英国保守党中一部分议员（主要是所谓“苏伊士集团”），急得跳了起来，抨击麦克米伦政府：这是“投降”和“出卖”。
    美国干预塞浦路斯问题的目的，不仅企图逐步取代英国在这个岛屿上的地位。它还想由此而复活希腊、土耳其、南斯拉夫三国组成的巴尔干军事联盟（这个联盟近年来由于希腊和土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上的尖锐冲突，已濒于名存实亡）。无疑地，铁托集团将在这个阴谋中被派定扮演一定的角色。“曼彻斯特卫报”的社论写道：铁托将于最近访问雅典。这次访问“不仅是社交性质的，在1954年，南斯拉夫参加了希腊和土耳其在巴尔干的联盟。……希腊和土耳其友谊的恢复，对于铁托总统可能有一种吸引力。”
    英国政府对苏黎世方案表示欢迎。这说明，保守党政府强行实施了几个月的塞浦路斯分治计划已经破产，现在不得不求助于另一种方式。当然，苏黎世方案仍然保持了分治计划的基本精神，而且根据这个方案，英国还保留了它对这个岛上的军事基地的控制。英国外交大臣劳埃德最近在下院的声明中就表示，英国决不让出它对军事基地的主权。而且应该看到，希腊和土耳其军队的进驻塞浦路斯，埋下了新的冲突的火种。在英国统治集团看来这种可能发生的冲突，正是维护它在塞浦路斯利益的一种因素。
    英国政府同意讨论苏黎世方案，是企图借此来达到有利于它自己的目的。它的目的是什么呢？“星期日泰晤士报”说得十分坦率：第一是巩固内部；第二是防止塞浦路斯“走向革命，或者是内战与混乱”；第三是务使英国保持在塞浦路斯的军事基地。这段话中，除了第一点有点打官腔以外，其余倒是肺腑之言。概括地说，就是设法分化塞浦路斯人民平息（至少削弱）他们对英国殖民统治的反抗，从而保持英国在这个岛上的特权，使它继续成为镇压中东民族解放运动的前哨阵地。
    但是过去的事实已经证明：使得英国在塞浦路斯不能安身、造成英国同塞浦路斯人民尖锐冲突的根源是：塞浦路斯人民要求真正的独立，但是，苏黎世方案不过是另一种殖民计划，它在让塞浦路斯“独立”的形式下，不但保持了英国对这个岛屿的控制，而且还要把它变成北大西洋集团的军事基地。这当然同塞浦路斯人民的愿望完全背道而驰的。美英帝国主义勾结起来想把这个殖民方案强加在塞浦路斯人民头上，而能不引起塞浦路斯人民的反对，这显然是痴心妄想。（附图片）
