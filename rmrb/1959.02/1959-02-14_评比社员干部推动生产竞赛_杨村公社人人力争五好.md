Appraising Commune Members and Cadres to Promote Production Competition
Yangcun Commune Strives for Five Goods in Everyone
(Our Tianjin, February 13th dispatch) Reporter Wen Ying reports: Yangcun People's Commune in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, has launched a vigorous competition campaign for everyone to strive for "Five Goods," thereby unveiling the battle prelude to striving for a great leap forward this year.

This competition campaign was launched on the basis of preliminary rectification of the people's commune. It was first proposed by the members of the Lilou Production Team in their competition for drive and advancement, and was enthusiastically responded to by more than 31,000 members of the entire commune. In carrying out the work of accumulating fertilizer and preparing for cultivation, this commune initially did not adopt the large-scale, special efforts, and mass movement approach of last winter. The commune members were holding back a lot of energy and did not know how to use it. The members of the Lilou Production Team asked the commune party committee: "It's too suffocating to work so slowly. How exactly are we going to work this year?" Some members also suggested: "We've already made a great leap forward for a year, so we should have a general evaluation first to see who did the best, and then follow his example this year." The commune party committee believed that this year's great leap forward was built on the foundation of last year's great leap forward, and that the general evaluation was an important link connecting the two movements. Therefore, they supported and mobilized the members to conduct the evaluation.

The evaluation began with summarizing everyone's contribution to the great leap forward movement in 1958 and their exemplary deeds of loving the commune. From the evaluation of good people and good deeds, the members came to a conclusion that to run the commune well and achieve a great leap forward, the members must achieve five goods: good advanced thinking, good work drive, good care of public property, good obedience to leadership, and good diligence and thrift. Cadres must also achieve five goods: sufficient work drive and good labor, good contact with the masses, good implementation of the party's policies, good unity between superiors and subordinates, and good integrity and selflessness. In the evaluation, everyone was given due credit for any contribution they made to the great leap forward movement last year. As a result, many people were rated as "Five Good" members and "Five Good" cadres. Four hundred and five people were rated as "Five Good" cadres, accounting for 31% of the total number of cadres. Six hundred and thirty-three cadres were rated as "Four Good," "Three Good," "Two Good," and "One Good," accounting for 48.8%. Fifteen thousand seven hundred and fifteen members were rated as "Five Good" members, accounting for 50.6% of all members. Adding those rated as "Four Good," "Three Good," "Two Good," and "One Good," they accounted for the vast majority of all members. These people were listed in order on the honor roll and entered into the honor book. In the evaluation, one hundred and forty-five good members were elected as cadres of production management areas or production teams. These "Five Good" cadres and "Five Good" members became advanced red flags planted in every corner of the commune, encouraging people to set off a wave of learning from the "Five Good" and catching up with the "Five Good." For a time, the trend of striving for goodness flourished. Now, the commune's competition for loving the commune and achieving high yields by learning from the "Five Good" and catching up with the "Five Good" has developed into a competition movement between production management areas, production teams, and production groups. The cadres and members of the Huangzhuang Production Management Area are determined to surpass the old Midian, which carried the red flag last year, in production and win the first "Five Good" unit. They have already achieved the first step, completing the task of storming the reed fields three days ahead of the old Midian. However, the old Midian has surpassed the opponent in wheat topdressing, harrowing, and sideline production.

The "Five Good" competition movement twisted the energy of cadres and members into one rope. The Dongliuhang Production Management Area originally arranged for each production team to apply five carts of coarse fertilizer per mu this year. At that time, many people thought it would be difficult to complete. After the launch of the "Five Good" love-the-commune competition movement, when discussing production targets, everyone not only increased the planned grain yield per mu but also increased the plan of applying five carts of fertilizer per mu tenfold, and came up with various methods of fertilizer production.

### 评比社员干部推动生产竞赛  杨村公社人人力争五好

    评比社员干部推动生产竞赛
    杨村公社人人力争五好
    本报天津13日电　记者文英报道：河北省武清县杨村人民公社轰轰烈烈地开展了一个人人争“五好”的竞赛运动，从而揭开了争取今年大跃进的战斗序幕。
    这个竞赛运动是在初步整顿了人民公社的基础上掀起来的，是由李楼生产队的社员们在比干劲、比先进中首先提出，得到全社三万一千多名社员热烈响应开展起来的。这个公社在开展积肥、备耕工作
  中，最初没有采取去年冬天那样大干、特干大搞群众运动的做法，社员们憋了一股干劲，不知道该怎样使出来。李楼生产队的社员们就问公社党委：“这么慢腾腾地干，太憋气。今年到底怎么干？”有些社员又提建议说：“咱们已经大干了一年应该先来一个总评比，看看谁干的最好，今年就按他的样子干。”公社党委认为今年大跃进是建筑在去年大跃进的基础上的，总评比是两个运动衔接起来的重要一环，便支持和发动社员们进行评比。
    评比是从总结每个人对1958年大跃进运动的贡献和爱社的模范事迹开始的。社员们从评比好人好事里，得出了一个结论，要办好社，要大跃进，社员必须作到五好：思想先进好，劳动干劲好，爱护公共财产好，服从领导好，勤俭节约好。干部也必须作到五好：工作干劲足、劳动好，联系群众好，贯彻执行党的政策好，上下团结好，廉洁奉公、大公无私好。在评比中，大家对于每一个人在去年大跃进运动中的任何一点贡献，都给了应有的评价。因此，有不少人被评为“五好”社员，“五好”干部。被评为“五好”干部的有四百零五人，占干部总数的31％，被评为“四好”、“三好”、“两好”、“一好”的干部有六百三十三人，占48.8％。被评为“五好”的社员有一万五千七百一十五名，占全体社员的50.6％，加上被评为“四好”、“三好”、“两好、“一好”的社员，占全体社员的绝大多数。这些人都依次列在光荣榜上，登入了光荣册内。评比中还有一百四十五名好社员被选举为生产管理区或生产队的干部。这些“五好”干部和“五好”社员，成了插遍全社各个角落的先进红旗，鼓舞人们掀起了学“五好”、赶“五好”的热潮，一时争好之风大兴。现在，这个公社的学“五好”、赶“五好”的爱社丰产竞赛，已发展为生产管理区、生产队、生产组之间的竞赛运动。黄庄生产管理区的干部和社员，决心在生产上超过去年扛红旗的老米店，夺得第一个“五好”单位。头一步他们已经胜利了，比老米店提前三天完成了突击打苇田的任务；但老米店却在小麦追肥、压耙和副业生产上压过了对方。
    “五好”竞赛运动把干部社员两股劲拧成了一股绳。东柳行生产管理区，原来向各生产队布置今年每亩地施五车粗肥。当时很多人都认为难以完成，“五好”爱社竞赛运动开展后，大家在讨论生产指标时，不仅提高了粮食亩产量的计划，也把每亩施五车肥的计划增加到十倍，想出了各种造肥方法。
