    Treasures in the Embrace of Famous Mountains
  　Tao Dan
    Yuelu Mountain is the last of the seventy-two peaks that undulate from Mount Heng, the Southern Mountain. Its overlapping ridges and self-contained form, coupled with its proximity to the clear Xiang River and leaning against the ancient city of Changsha, have long made it a popular destination for pilgrimage and sightseeing. On the mountain, the remains of temples built during the Jin Dynasty still exist; there is also the Sui Dynasty relic pagoda and the Lushan Temple Stele written by Li Yong of the Tang Dynasty. The Yuelu Academy, where Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty lectured, is now the site of Hunan Normal College.
    Through the management of successive dynasties, the mountain is now covered with towering ancient trees and secluded stone paths. In spring, "pomegranate flowers line the road," these mountain pomegranates, praised by Bai Juyi as "this flower among flowers resembles Xishi, making hibiscus and peony look like ugly women" and "looks so exquisite it doesn't seem to belong to this world," also known as azaleas, bloom all over the mountain. Locals vividly call them "映山红" (reddening the mountains). Subsequently, wild roses, crape myrtles, gardenias, wild lilacs, and more bloom in succession. When the swallows arrive, orioles, thrushes, kingfishers, and others also come, using their melodious chirping to accompany the songs of the tourists. In summer, the temperature here is much lower than in the city. Around the fifteenth day of the month, sitting in the Aiwan Pavilion and Banshan Pavilion area to enjoy the "moonlit mountains painting the universe," the cool breeze caresses, opening up the mind. By autumn, the air is crisp and the sky is high, the clouds and mists change, "reddening" the mountains and forests, "making the river water crystal clear." In winter, when the miscellaneous trees have fallen, a lush scene of pine and cypress, privet trees, and splendid camellias is revealed. Occasionally, when encountering colder weather (such temperatures are rare in Hunan), the mist on the mountaintop freezes into a thin layer of ice outside the emerald green branches and leaves. When the sunlight shines on it, it is bright and vibrant, extremely dazzling. The mythical jade flowers and grasses may be like this? In short, throughout the year, it is always scenic, beautiful and vast, serene, making people feel refreshed. A trip here during your busy schedule can relieve fatigue and forget worries. Moreover, "eagles soar in the sky, fish swim in the shallow bottom," how inspiring and thought-provoking!
    However, Yuelu Mountain is by no means a place to escape the world; it embodies more of our nation's distinct traces of exploring the truth and fighting heroically. On the mountainside are the tombs of Huang Xing and Cai E, the pioneers of the democratic revolution, and also buried are the two martyrs Huang Ai and Pang Renquan, the first batch of martyrs to sacrifice in the Chinese workers' movement. Mao Zedong often read in the Aiwan Pavilion surrounded by three mountains in his early years, and now the plaque on the pavilion is written by Chairman Mao. Although this mountain has appeared in poetry and prose for more than a thousand years, its real development began only after it belonged to the people. At the time of liberation, there was only one university here, with 1,500 students; now there are five institutions of higher learning, two secondary technical schools, and two scientific research institutes. The number of students in higher education alone has reached 14,000, and Hunan University, which is being prepared, will begin enrollment this summer. People are building their own famous mountains, increasing its trees by several times, and its buildings by dozens of times. The pavilions and kiosks on the mountain have been renovated, roads have been repaved and opened up, more ornamental plants have been cultivated, and the fragrance of osmanthus is used to permeate the bleak autumn wind.
    Since the Party Central Committee established the policy of combining education with productive labor, new and more glorious missions have also fallen on the stones and soil of Yuelu Mountain. Teachers and students discovered that there is a silica sand mine on campus. The quality is very good. It is a high-quality glass raw material. The surface has been differentiated very loosely. It can be dug with a pickaxe. After digging, washing away the dirt, and drying it in a pot, a silica sand factory was established. During the Great Leap Forward for steelmaking, the people on the mountain asked Yuelu Mountain: "What should we do? Yuelu Mountain, can we also contribute?" Yuelu Mountain's answer was positive. It offered high-quality limonite, which is also easy to mine. As a result, Yuelu Mountain stopped being silent at night, the motor of the blower roared, and the beautiful flames of yellow, red, and orange cut through the starry sky, and the molten iron sparkled and ran happily, as if to compete with the Xiang River—competing in flow rate? Comparing beauty? Comparing practical value?
    People have gone up the mountain! Those who study geology, those who study geography, are carrying pickaxes and hammers. Yuelu Mountain is welcoming such careful visitors for the first time! They are not here to seek seclusion, but to explore treasures; not to admire, but to learn. The composition of Yuelu Mountain is really good. It has iron, aluminum, and inexhaustible silica sand. Even the white clay on the ground contains more than 20% of aluminum trioxide, which can be used to fire refractory materials. The mountain grass is also very useful. After visiting old farmers, analyzing, and testing, more than 720 kinds of pesticides were prepared. Among them, eleven kinds of insecticides have reached 100% efficacy, and some difficult-to-treat insects, such as citrus cottony scale insects and cabbage leaf miners, cannot escape the fate of extinction. The messy cogon grass growing everywhere on the mountain is also cut down, chopped, and distilled to obtain aromatic oil. Nowadays, people can smell a strange fragrance at the foot of the mountain, which is emitted by the aromatic oil factory.
    Be proud of this famous mountain! In the past, it was because of its beauty, and now it is even more because of its richness.

    名山怀里有珍宝
  　陶丹
    岳麓山，是南岳衡山逶迤起伏七十二峰中的最末一个。它岗峦重叠，自成体势，又因临近清湛的湘江，靠着长沙古城，所以很早就成为香火和游览的胜地了。山上，晋朝时候修建的寺庙遗迹至今犹存；山上还留有隋朝舍利的塔，唐李邕写的麓山寺碑。宋朱熹讲学的岳麓书院，现在是湖南师范学院的院址了。
    经过历代的经营，山上古木参天，石径通幽。春天，“山柘榴花红夹路”，这被白香山评为“花中此物似西施，芙容芍药皆嫫母”“细看不似人间有”的山柘榴，亦即杜鹃花，开得遍山皆是，此地人形象地叫它做“映山红”。随后，陆续开放着野蔷薇、紫薇、梔子、野丁香……。燕子来时，黄鹂、画眉、翡翠等也来了，用婉转清脆的鸣哨去伴和游客的歌声。夏天，这儿的温度比城里低得多，望日前后，在爱晚亭、半山亭一带坐赏“千山月午乾坤画”，凉风吹拂，胸襟开畅。到秋来，气爽天高，云霞变幻，“红遍”山林，“碧透”江水。冬天，杂木零落了，便显出一片葱郁的松柏、女贞树和烂漫的山茶来。偶而遇到较冷的气候（这样的气温在湖南是不多的），山顶的雾气在翠绿的枝叶外面凝成一层薄冰，日光一照，又明又艳，灿烂极了。古人幻想中的琼花瑶草，也许就是这样的吧？总之一年四季，这里总是风光明媚、秀丽辽阔、清幽，使人心旷神怡。你在繁忙中到此一游，可以一解困顿，可以一忘烦忧。而况“鹰击长空，鱼翔浅底”，又是何等地励人志气、引人深思！
    但是，岳麓山绝不是避世之所，它更多地表现着我们民族探索真理、英勇奋斗的鲜明的痕迹。半山上有民主革命的先辈黄兴、蔡锷的坟墓，还埋葬着中国工人运动中第一批牺牲的黄爱、庞人铨二烈士。三山环抱的爱晚亭，毛主席早年常在此读书，现在亭上的匾额便是毛主席写的。尽管这山见诸诗文已有千多年的历史，但它真正的发展是从属于人民以后才开始的。解放时，这里只有一所大学，学生一千五百人；现在有五所高等学校、两个中等技术学校、两个科学研究所，只高等学校的学生已达一万四千人，而筹备中的湖南大学又将于今年暑假招生。人们修建自己的名山，使它的树木增加了几倍，而建筑物则增加几十倍。山上翻修了亭榭，重铺和开辟了道路，栽培了更多的观赏植物，用桂花的香气熏染着萧瑟秋风。
    自从党中央确定了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以来，新的更光荣的使命也落到岳麓山的石土上。老师和学生们发现校内有硅砂矿，质量很好，是上等的玻璃原料，表面已经分化得很松，用铁镐就能挖得动，挖起来用水洗净泥土，放在锅子里焙干，一座硅砂工厂就建立起来了。全民大炼钢铁时候，山上人们逼问岳麓山：“怎么办？岳麓山，咱们也能出一分力吧？”岳麓山的回答是积极的，它献出了质地优良的褐铁矿，而且很易开采。于是，岳麓山停止了夜间的阒寂，鼓风机的马达喧闹着，黄色、红色、橙色的美丽的火焰划破了星空，铁水闪着火花，快活地奔跑，好像要和湘江比赛——比流速？比美？比实用价值？
    人们都上山去了！学地质的，学地理的，带着洋镐和锤子。岳麓山第一次招待这样细心的游客！他们不是来寻幽，而是来探宝；不是来玩赏，而是来学习。岳麓山成份真好呀，有铁、有铝、有取之不尽的硅砂，连地上的白胶泥也含有百分之二十几的三氧化二铝，可以用来烧制耐火材料。岳麓山的山草也大有用处，经过访问老农，分析、试验配制了七百二十多种农药。其中有十一种杀虫药功效达到百分之百，一些难治的虫子如柑桔的吹绵介壳虫，白菜的潜叶蝇，都难逃灭亡的命运了。山上到处丛生的乱蓬蓬的茅草也被割下来把它切碎、蒸馏，就可以得到芳香油。如今人们在山脚下就可以闻到一种奇异的清香，那便是芳香油厂散发出来的。
    为这座名山骄傲吧！从前因为它美丽，现在更因为它富饶。
