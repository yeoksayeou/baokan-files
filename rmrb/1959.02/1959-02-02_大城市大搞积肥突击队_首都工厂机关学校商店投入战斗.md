Big Cities Launch Manure Collection Blitz
Capital's Factories, Government Offices, Schools, and Stores Join the Battle

    (Reported by this newspaper) Following the city-wide manure collection and fertilizer production broadcast rally on January 30th, the people of the capital's urban districts immediately launched a mass manure collection campaign.

    Many factories, government offices, schools, and stores formed manure collection shock brigades and immediately joined the battle. The sanitation workers in the Xicheng district were even more enthusiastic about collecting manure. The Deshengmen branch of this sanitation team formed a manure collection shock brigade, and on January 30th, fourteen people collected over three thousand catties of dirty soil in three hours. The construction team under this branch also dispatched a large number of people to find fertilizer sources, and in two days, they have investigated more than thirty abandoned seepage wells and five hundred and ninety sewage ponds containing fertilizer. The 450 employees of the Beijing Fur Garment Factory No. 3 collected more than 800 catties of fertilizer on the afternoon of February 1st from workshops, sewers, toilets, and courtyards throughout the factory. The factory's useless scraps of fur left over from production are high-quality fertilizer for vegetable gardens. To support the farmer brothers in striving for greater harvests, they collected every corner, even the fur scraps in the brick seams, for fertilizer. The Baoquan Bathhouse in the Dongcheng district plans to clean out all the sewage pits, seepage wells, and toilets inside and outside the business premises, estimating that it can produce 20,000 catties of fertilizer. They also decided to dig a large pit to collect the dust, fruit peels, and other debris swept up every day to make fertilizer. The police officers and cadres of the Chaoyang Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau formed three combat teams: digging seepage wells, scraping dirty soil, and sweeping filth. The two seepage wells in this agency had not been dug for many years, and the frozen soil was more than a foot thick. After a few short hours of fighting, the three teams collected a total of 10,000 catties of fertilizer. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee organs combined the pre-Spring Festival cleaning with a large-scale manure collection campaign. The second secretary of the organ's Party committee and all the staff members of the organ collected fertilizer together. The cooks scraped out the ash accumulated in the flues of the stoves and mixed it with leftover soup and rotten vegetable leaves to make fertilizer. In a large courtyard on Xishuncheng Street, Hepingmen, thirty-four households designated February 1st as manure collection day, and more than one hundred people in the courtyard worked together to collect a large amount of garbage fertilizer for the farmers. More than 130 students from the Physics and Chemistry departments of Beijing Normal University joined the farmers in the Luodaozhuang station of the Si Ji Qing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing to scoop and compost manure. Seventeen second-year students from the History Department who stayed at the school dug up the school's septic tank to collect fertilizer on the afternoon of February 1st, and in two hours, they collected more than fifty buckets of fecal fertilizer.

    The manure collection campaign of the people from all walks of life in the capital's urban areas is continuing to develop.

    本报讯　首都城区人民在1月30日全市积肥造肥广播大会后，立即展开了全民性的积肥运动。
    许多工厂、机关、学校、商店纷纷组织积肥突击队，当天便投入战斗。西城区清洁工人们的积肥干劲越鼓越足。这个清洁队的德胜门分队组成了积肥突击队，1月30日干了三个小时十四人就搜集脏土三千斤以上。这个队所属的修建队并出动大批人马寻找肥源，两天中已调查出三十多处废渗井和五百九十个有肥料的污水池。北京市皮毛裁制三厂的四百五十名职工，1日下午在全厂的车间、下水道、厕所和院子等地，收集了八百多斤肥料。这个厂生产上裁剪下来无用的皮毛残渣，是菜地的优质肥料，为了支援农民兄弟争取更大丰收，他们把每个角落连砖头缝里的皮毛残渣都收集起来作肥料。东城区宝泉澡堂计划把营业室内外各处的污水坑、渗水井、厕所全掏净，估计可出两万斤肥料，他们还决定挖个大坑把每天打扫的尘土、果皮等集聚作肥料。北京市公安局朝阳分局的民警和干部，组成了掏渗水井、刮污土、扫秽土三个战斗小组。这个机关的两口渗水井多年没挖、冻土有一尺多厚，他们经过短短几个小时的战斗，三个小组共积了一万斤肥料。北京市人民委员会机关结合春节前的大扫除大搞积肥运动。机关党委第二书记和机关内的全体工作人员一起搜集肥料，炊事员们把吹风灶烟道内的积灰扒出来，和剩菜汤、烂菜叶等混在一起制成肥料。和平门西顺城街一个大院中，有三十四户居民把1日定为积肥日，全院一百多人齐动手，为农民积了大量的垃圾肥。北京师范学院物理、化学两系学生一百三十多人在京郊四季青人民公社罗道庄站和农民一起掏粪、沤粪。历史系二年级留校学生十七人在1日下午刨开学校的化粪池掏肥，在二小时内，积粪肥五十多桶。
    现在首都城区各界人民的积肥运动正在继续发展中。
