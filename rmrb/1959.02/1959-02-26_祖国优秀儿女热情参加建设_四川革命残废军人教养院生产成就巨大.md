Outstanding Sons and Daughters of the Motherland Enthusiastically Participate in Construction
Significant Production Achievements of the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Convalescent Home

    (By our newspaper) Under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, more than 300 disabled soldiers at the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Convalescent Home overcame various physical difficulties, diligently studied production techniques, and actively learned art and culture, determined to contribute more to the construction of the motherland.

    In the past six months, these 300 disabled soldiers have voluntarily established 18 production and learning organizations, including palm fiber weaving, bamboo ware, telecommunications, embroidery, agriculture, and literary creation, and have also organized two after-school performance teams. These production and learning organizations were all organized by them according to their health conditions, interests, and aspirations. They have now woven thousands of exquisite palm fiber products, sweaters, embroidery, and various bamboo wares; successfully trial-produced 16 kinds of wild fiber products; raised a large number of livestock and poultry; and installed and repaired nearly 30 radios and more than 300 hand-cranked tricycles. The two after-school performance teams have also toured Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and various parts of Sichuan Province, with audiences reaching more than 950,000, receiving enthusiastic welcome and praise from the audience.

    In learning various production techniques and cultural and scientific knowledge, these heroic soldiers who had shed blood and been wounded on the battlefield demonstrated unparalleled perseverance. Working in the fiber factory were twelve convalescents with leg amputations. Every day, they supported themselves with crutches, sat on hand-cranked tricycles, and traveled almost every riverbank and field within ten to twenty li, looking for raw materials everywhere. Lacking knowledge of chemistry, they studied and experimented, working from five o'clock in the morning until late at night, and finally made 16 kinds of wild fiber products from castor, bitter bamboo, and the like. The convalescents wrote such a poem: "The will of the honored soldier is firm and unwavering, with no feet we tread across the horizon; though blind we read newspapers, with no hands we overturn Mount Taihang." Encouraged by this spirit of revolutionary optimism, the repair and telecommunications groups alone made 15 tool reforms and inventions in just a few months. The dozen or so convalescents in the telecommunications group initially only learned to install simple crystal radios, but after half a year of study, they have now installed 30 five-tube radios. Recently, they have also drawn up a new plan to trial-produce new products such as semiconductor generators and semiconductor radios.

    In order to directly support the agricultural Great Leap Forward, the convalescents also actively participated in the nearby rural areas' rush to harvest and plant, and in the movement to accumulate fertilizer. Last year, they helped local areas harvest more than 350 mu of wheat, rapeseed, and rice; and accumulated more than 650,000 jin of fertilizer for the local communes.

    Recently, the convalescent home has newly opened a political, cultural, and technical school, with five departments including agronomy, animal husbandry, handicrafts, and culture, and research groups such as telecommunications and chemical engineering, preparing to vigorously carry out literary and scientific and technological research work, so that the convalescents can quickly become both red and expert scientific and technical talents, and play a greater role in the socialist construction of the motherland.

### 祖国优秀儿女热情参加建设  四川革命残废军人教养院生产成就巨大

    祖国优秀儿女热情参加建设
    四川革命残废军人教养院生产成就巨大
    本报讯　四川革命残废军人教养院三百多名残废军人，在全民大跃进的鼓舞下，战胜生理上的各种困难，刻苦钻研生产技术，积极学习艺术、文化，立志为祖国建设事业贡献更大力量。
    这三百名残废军人近半年来自动建立了棕丝编织、竹器、电讯、刺绣、农业、文艺创作等十八个生产和学习组织，还组织了两个课余演出队。这些生产和学习组织都是他们按照自己的健康条件、兴趣和志愿组织起来的。现在他们已经织成几千件精致的棕丝制品、毛衣、刺绣和各种竹器；试制成功十六种野生纤维产品；饲养了大批家畜家禽；还安装和修理了近三十个收音机和三百多部手摇三轮车。两个课余演出队也分别到北京、天津、上海、广州和四川省各地进行巡回演出，观众达九十五万多人，受到观众们热烈的欢迎和赞扬。
    在学习各种生产技术和文化科学知识中，这些曾在战场上流血负伤的英雄战士，表现了无比坚韧的毅力。在纤维厂工作的是十二个两腿残缺的休养员。他们每天扶着拐杖，坐着手摇三轮车，几乎跑遍一、二十里内的河沿和田野，到处寻找原料。缺乏化学方面的知识，就边看书边实验，每天从清晨五时一直忙碌到深夜，终于用蓖麻、苦竹等制成十六种野生纤维产品。休养员们写过这样一首诗：“荣军意志坚又坚，无脚踏破地平川；双目失明读书报，无手推倒太行山。”在这种革命乐观主义精神的鼓舞下，仅修配、电讯两个组，在短短几个月内就作出工具改革和创造发明十五件。电讯组的十几个休养员最初只学会安装简单的矿石机，经过半年来的钻研，现在已安装了五灯收音机三十部。最近，他们又订出新计划，要试制半导体发电器和半导体收音机等新产品。
    为了直接支援农业大跃进，休养员们还积极参加附近农村抢收抢种和积肥运动。去年，他们帮助当地收割麦子、菜子、水稻等共三百五十多亩；还给当地公社积肥六十五万多斤。
    最近，这个教养院新开办了一所政治文化技术学校，分设了农艺、畜牧、工艺、文化等五个系和电讯、化工等研究组，准备大力开展文艺和科学技术研究工作，使休养员迅速成为又红又专的科学技术人材，在祖国社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
