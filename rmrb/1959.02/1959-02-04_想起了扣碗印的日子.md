    Remembering the Days of Bowl-Printed Couplets
    By the CCP Shanxi Shuoxian County Committee, Li Qing

    The Spring Festival is approaching, and people are busy preparing for this festive season, some whitewashing walls, others taking apart and washing clothes. But the most delightful thing is putting up new paper window decorations and pasting bright red Spring Festival couplets. About half a month before the Spring Festival, people go to the grassroots cooperatives to buy their favorite red and green paper and busily paste them up.

    One day, more than twenty cooperative members went together to Jingping Town to buy red and green paper and other Spring Festival supplies. On the way back home, everyone was happy, talking and laughing. Some said that Zhang San wrote good calligraphy and should be asked to write the couplets, others said that Li Si wrote good calligraphy and should be asked to write them. They argued for a long time, but couldn't agree on who wrote the best. While they were talking and laughing, old man Zhao Fucai sighed, "Ah!" Everyone asked him: "Uncle Zhao, what's wrong?"

    Old Zhao then began to explain the reason: "It's a long story, going back to the time before liberation. At that time, there were only thirty-odd households in our village, and only one semi-literate scholar who knew four or five hundred characters. People had no one to keep accounts of their financial dealings, so they had to record some black ink dots behind their doors, draw some black ink strokes on the walls, or draw some circles on white paper. Some even put beans in a bowl to indicate the amount of mutual debt and profit and loss. And there was one big difficulty, which was writing couplets for the Spring Festival. Every Spring Festival, every household would prepare big red couplet paper a month in advance, but where would anyone find someone who could write! Households that were relatively well-off would take a little wine and meat they had prepared for the New Year to ask the schoolteacher to write them, but what about the poor households who couldn't afford to hire a teacher? There was no other way, they had to smear some black ink around the edge of a bowl and stamp round prints on the bright red paper to paste up. Big bowl prints for the couplets on the main gate, smaller bowl prints for the couplets on the inner door, and other couplets would be stamped with small cups. Remembering the bowl-printed couplets, ah! It really breaks my heart. Now it's different. With the foundation of two or three years of literacy campaign, plus last year's Great Leap Forward, I think you've all become teachers. Not to mention you clever and quick-witted young people, even this clumsy old man like me can write a few couplets."

    想起了扣碗印的日子
    中共山西朔县县委会  立青
    春节快到了，人们都在为过好这个佳节忙着做准备工作，有的刷墙，有的拆洗衣裳。但是最叫人高兴的是换糊花窗和贴鲜艳的红纸春联。在临近春节前半个月左右，人们就去基层社购买自己心爱的红绿纸张忙着贴起来了。
    有一天，二十多个社员相跟着到井坪镇去购买红绿纸和其它春节用品。在返回家的路上，大家都是欢欢喜喜，说说笑笑，有的说，张三写的毛笔字好，要让张三给写，有的说，李四写的毛笔字好，要让李四给写。吵了半天，究竟也没争吵清到底谁写的好。正在说笑之间，赵福才老汉却“唉！”的一声叹了口气，大家都问他：赵大叔，你怎么啦？
    赵老汉就把来由讲开了：“说起来就话长了，还是解放前的事情。那时候咱们全村三十多户人家，只有一个识四、五百字的小秀才。人们有个钱项交往根本没有个会记账的，只好在家门后边记些黑墨点点，墙上画些黑墨杠杠，或是在白纸上画些圈圈，也有的是在碗里放些豆豆，就用这些东西来标示互相赊欠、盈亏的数目。还有一件大难事，就是过春节的时候写对联，每逢过春节，家家户户在前一个月就准备好大红的对联纸，可是哪里有人会写啊！光景比较过的富裕的户，就拿上自己准备过年的一点酒肉，去请教书先生给写，请不起先生的穷户怎么办呢？没有别的办法，只好沿着碗边儿涂些黑墨，在鲜艳的红纸上扣些圆圆的印儿贴了出去。大门上的对联扣大碗印儿，家门上的对联扣些小碗印儿，其它对联就分别扣些盅子印儿贴上。想起了扣碗印儿，唉！真是伤心极了。现在不同了，有了二、三年的扫盲基础，加上去年这一年的大跃进，我看你们都成了老师了，别说你们这些聪明伶俐的青年人，就是我这个笨老头子，也能写它几副对联啦。”
