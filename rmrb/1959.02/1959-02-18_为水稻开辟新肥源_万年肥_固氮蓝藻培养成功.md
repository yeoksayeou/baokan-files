    Opening Up New Fertilizer Sources for Rice
    "Ten Thousand Year Fertilizer" - Nitrogen-Fixing Blue-Green Algae Successfully Cultivated
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, February 17th) In order to vigorously support the greater leap forward in agricultural production this year, the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has opened up a new fertilizer source for rice, namely nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae.
    Nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae is a lower aquatic plant that can fix free nitrogen from the air and convert it into organic matter within the algal body. During its life cycle, or after its death, a large amount of organic nitrogen is secreted or dissolved in the water. It does not die in drought, heat, or cold, and can reproduce in large quantities once conditions are suitable. Therefore, planting it in paddy fields is like setting up a never-ending nitrogen fertilizer factory there. People call this fertilizer "ten thousand year fertilizer."
    Through isolation and cultivation experiments, the Institute of Hydrobiology has identified four types of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae (namely Fish Star Algae 686, 678, 670, and Nostoc 508). Among them, "Fish Star Algae 686" has the highest nitrogen fixation rate. According to experiments, rice using nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae increased grain number by 10% and weight by 15.4% compared to rice using ammonium sulfate.
    In order to facilitate large-scale promotion in rural areas, the Institute of Hydrobiology is currently actively cultivating nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae in outdoor soil ponds. It also went to the agricultural technology training class held by the Xiaogan Prefectural Party Committee to explain the principles and methods of cultivating and using nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae, and held a small exhibition of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae.

### 为水稻开辟新肥源  万年肥——固氮蓝藻培养成功

    为水稻开辟新肥源 
    万年肥——固氮蓝藻培养成功
    本报武汉17日电　为了大力支援今年农业生产的更大跃进，中国科学院水生生物研究所给水稻开辟了新的肥源，这就是固氮蓝藻。
    固氮蓝藻是一种低等水生植物，能把空气中游离的氮素固定下来，成为藻体内的有机物质。它的生活期间或在死亡以后，都有大量的有机氮分泌或溶解在水中；它在干旱、炎热和寒冷时不会死亡，一旦条件合适，又可大量繁殖。因此，把它种在稻田中，就像在那里设立了一个永不停工的氮肥工厂，人们称这种肥料是“万年肥”。
    水生生物研究所经过分离培养试验，找出四种固氮蓝藻（即鱼星藻686、678、670、念珠藻508）。其中以“鱼星藻686”固氮量最高。据试验，施用固氮蓝藻的水稻和施用硫酸铵的水稻相比，粒数增加10％，重量增加15.4％。
    为了便于在农村中大量推广，水生生物研究所最近正积极在试验室外土池子内培养固氮蓝藻，还到孝感地委举办的农业技术训练班讲解培养和使用固氮蓝藻的道理、方法，举办了小型固氮蓝藻展览会。
