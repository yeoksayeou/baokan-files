Quick as a Flash
Wang Wentao

The people of the whole country are striving with full confidence to achieve a greater leap forward this year. This confidence does not come out of thin air. Firstly, we have seen the various more favorable conditions created by last year's Great Leap Forward for this year's Great Leap Forward; secondly, we have seen the momentum of the production upsurge that has already surged like a spring tide; and thirdly, and more importantly, our minds have been armed by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and we fully understand that this year is the most decisive year in the three years of hard work. With a clear mind, nimble steps, and walking on the broad road, with the goal of victory right in front of us, how can we not move quickly?

Revolutionaries always need the revolutionary drive of boiling blood, strong will, and arduous struggle, and must always generate heat and shine like the sun above our heads. Some people are against doing this. They call themselves "prudent factions," but in fact their "prudence" is not true "prudence," but a conservative ideology of stagnation and fear of falling when taking a step. They are unwilling to look forward, and therefore unwilling to look at the glorious achievements of 1958. If we all do what they say, we will become idiots and will not be able to do anything.

In order to move forward more bravely, we must continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, that is, opposing cold thinking. And we must confront them head-on. We naturally advocate a cool head and scientific analysis of things, but first of all, we must oppose right-leaning conservatism, fully estimate the achievements and experiences of 1958, as well as the various favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in 1959, hold high the red flag of a greater leap forward, let people sprint up, and let the thought of taking a breath disappear under the footsteps of people's great leap forward.

    快步如飞
    王文涛
    全国人民正在满怀信心地力争今年来一个更大的跃进。这信心不是凭空冒出来的。一则，看到了去年大跃进为今年的大跃进创设的各种更为有利的条件；二则看到了已经如春潮涌起的生产高潮的气势；三则，也是更重要的，头脑已经受到了八届六中全会决议的武装，而且十分懂得今年是三年苦战中最有决定性的一年。头脑清爽，步履矫健，走的又是康庄大道，胜利目标就在眼前摆着，怎能不快步如飞呢？
    革命者永远需要热血沸腾、意志旺盛、坚苦奋战的革命干劲，要像我们头顶上的太阳一样永远发热，永远发光。有些人却反对这样做。他们自封为“稳健派”，实际上他们的“稳健”，并不是什么真正的“稳健”，乃是一种停滞不前、唯恐走一步路就要摔跤的保守思想。他们是不愿意往前看的，因而也就不愿意去看1958年的辉煌成就了。如果我们都按他们的话去办，那我们就会变成白痴，什么事也做不出来。
    为了更勇猛的前进，仍然是要继续反对右倾保守思想，也就是反对冷冰冰的思想。而且要同他们针锋相对。我们自然是主张头脑冷静和对事物进行科学分析的，但首先要反对右倾保守，要充分估计1958年的成绩和经验，以及1959年更大跃进的各种有利条件，高举更大跃进的红旗，让人们飞奔上去，让松一口气的思想，消失在人们大跃进的脚步下。
