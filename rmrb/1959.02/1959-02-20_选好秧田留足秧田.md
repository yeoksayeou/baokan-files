The production teams of the Xuhong Third Team of the Tongcheng Commune Construction Management Area in Tongcheng County, Hubei, have reserved sufficient seedling fields. These seedling fields have achieved "three goods" and "two cleans": three goods are having sufficient base fertilizer prepared, careful and fine harrowing, and designated personnel for management; two cleans are cleaning up weeds on the edges of the field ridges and eliminating pests over the winter. Because seedling fields were prepared in a timely manner this year, commune member Peng Yunfu said with great emotion: "In the past, there was not enough preparation of seedling fields over the winter, resulting in many pests, or thin and yellow seedlings. This year, we selected good and sufficient seedling fields early, and the plan to double production is sure to be realized."

    选好秧田留足秧田
    我们湖北通城县通城公社建设管理区旭红三中队各生产小组留足了秧田。这些秧田并做到
  “三好”、“二净”：三好是底肥准备好、精耕细耙好、定人管理好；二净是田埂边杂草除净、虫害隔冬消灭净。由于今年及时准备好了秧田，社员彭运付很感动地说：“过去隔冬秧田准备不够，不是虫害多，就是苗瘦发黄。今年我们提早选好、选足了秧田，产量翻一番的规划准能实现。”　　　　　（旭红通讯组）
