Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Soviet Military Attaché to China, Major General Zudov, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Soviet Army.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, attended the reception. He expressed heartfelt and warm congratulations to the great Soviet people and the glorious Soviet army on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the powerful Soviet armed forces were created and nurtured by the great Soviet Communist Party headed by Lenin. Its forty-one-year history is a history of moving from victory to victory.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that in recent years, the Soviet Union's economy, culture, and science and technology have undergone amazing development, and the success of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the launching of three artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets, and so on, all eloquently illustrate this point. The upsurge of the Soviet economy and the development of science and technology have enabled the Soviet armed forces to be equipped with the most advanced technology, and its combat power is continuing to increase. Marshal Peng Dehuai then spoke of the victorious closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the magnificent Soviet national economic seven-year construction plan, saying that this great event is of great significance to the international communist movement, to the national independence movements of colonial and semi-colonial peoples, and to the cause of defending world peace. Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the glorious Soviet army and the armies of other socialist countries, are shoulder to shoulder defending the security of the entire socialist camp and world peace. The combat friendship between the Chinese and Soviet armies, based on common cause and common ideals, is eternal and unbreakable, and it is constantly developing, and its future is infinitely bright.

Major General Zudov first delivered a speech at the reception, outlining the glorious path that the Soviet Army and Navy had experienced in the past forty-one years. He said that the establishment and development of the Soviet armed forces are closely linked to the history of the Soviet state. On the basis of the victory of socialism, our motherland has entered a new stage of development, that is, the stage of fully launching the construction of a communist society. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which closed not long ago, marked the beginning of this historical period.

Major General Zudov said that the effective measures taken by the Soviet Union and its allies to ease international tensions and prevent war have been stubbornly rejected or evaded by the founders and practitioners of "cold war" and "power politics." Under such circumstances, the Soviet government has had to take measures to continuously consolidate our country's national defense capabilities. He said that the technical equipment, personnel training, and cultivation of the Soviet armed forces are all fully in line with the requirements of modern military affairs. But the Soviet Union has never prepared and is not now preparing to attack anyone. Major General Zudov finally said that the high state of combat readiness and combat effectiveness of the Soviet Army and Navy, as well as the unbreakable combat friendship and unity between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the armies of the socialist camp countries, are a reliable guarantee for the safety of the people of all countries engaged in socialist and communist construction, and a guarantee for the peace and security of the people of the world.

Invited to attend tonight's reception were Senior General Xu Guangda, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Li Juikui, Air Force Senior General Liu Yalou, Senior General Chen Xilian, Senior General Chen Bojun, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Fang Qiang and other senior generals from various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Also invited to attend the reception were Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Shen Yanbing, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, attended tonight's reception.

Also invited to attend the reception were diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to China.

    新华社23日讯　苏联驻华武官朱道夫少将今晚举行招待会，庆祝苏联建军四十一周年。
    国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅出席了招待会。他在会上代表中国人民解放军向伟大的苏联人民和光荣的苏联军队表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。他说，强大的苏联武装力量，是以列宁为首的伟大的苏联共产党所创造和培养起来的。它的四十一年的历史，是从胜利走向胜利的历史。
    彭德怀元帅说，近年来，苏联的经济、文化和科学技术有了惊人的发展，洲际弹道导弹的成功，三颗人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭的发射等等，都雄辩地说明了这一点。苏联经济的高涨和科学技术的发展，使苏联武装部队能够用最先进的技术装备起来，它的战斗威力正在继续不断提高。彭德怀元帅接着谈到了苏共二十一次代表大会的胜利闭幕和宏伟的苏联国民经济七年建设计划，他说，这一伟大的事件，对于国际共产主义运动、对于殖民地半殖民地人民的民族独立运动和保卫世界和平事业，都有十分重大的意义。彭德怀元帅说，中国人民解放军和光荣的苏联军队以及其他社会主义国家军队一起，肩并肩地保卫着整个社会主义阵营的安全和世界和平。以共同事业和共同理想为基础的中苏两国军队之间的战斗友谊，是永恒的和牢不可破的，它正在不断地发展，它的前途是无限光明的。
    朱道夫少将在招待会上首先致词，他概述了苏联陆海军四十一年所经历的光荣道路后说，苏联武装力量的建立和发展与苏维埃国家的历史是紧密相联的。在社会主义胜利的基础上，我们祖国进入了新的发展时期，即全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。不久以前闭幕的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会标志着这一历史时期的开始。
    朱道夫少将说，苏联及其盟国为缓和国际紧张局势和预防战争所采取的有效措施，遭到了“冷战”和“实力政策”的创始人和奉行者们的顽固拒绝或回避。在这种情况下，苏联政府不得不采取措施，以便不断地巩固我国的国防力量。他说，目前苏联武装力量的技术装备、人员的训练和培养都能完全合乎现代军事上的要求。但是苏联从来不准备，现在也不准备进攻任何人。朱道夫少将最后说，苏联陆海军的高度的战备和战斗力，以及与中国人民解放军、与社会主义阵营各国军队之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊和团结，是从事社会主义和共产主义建设的各国人民安全的可靠保证，是全世界人民的和平和安全的保证。
