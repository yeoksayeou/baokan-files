    Making a Pulley at Night
    Worker Yan Jinhai, Hengyang Second Machinery Factory, Hunan

    Xiao Long had just finished lathing the bottom box of the pulley, and it was already eleven o'clock at night. He quickly and forcefully pulled out the lathe bed and placed it to one side. His knees were aching slightly. He stood up, stretched a few times, and walked around for a while, and the fatigue was completely gone.

    The pouring crew had been off work for over an hour, and the sand removers were working non-stop, gusts of hot air blasting, as something was turned out.

    Xiao Long turned around, carefully examining the freshly lathed workpiece. He smiled, filled with an indescribable sense of happiness. From morning until now, although two pulleys were not yet finished, wasn't this one about to be completed? This was the culmination of his months of hard work! In the afternoon, several veteran workers passed by him and repeatedly praised him: "This young man is really good; in just a few days, he can make such a variety of products." When he heard these words, he always felt a warmth in his heart, and a pleasant smile appeared on his face; however, he always lowered his head and worked in silence.

    He rested for a moment, then squatted down again, and picked up a compass and a small piece of glass, ready to draw a diagram, but suddenly put them down again. His smiling face suddenly tightened into a frown. He stood up, stamping his feet hard, muttering to himself in complaint, "Alas! Why didn't I ask?" It turned out that the pulleys they had been making always had four ribs. This afternoon, the director had told him: "After the four-rib ones are finished, start making five-rib ones." At the time, he was so busy and flustered that he just responded with a grunt, without asking about the method. Now that he was actually doing it, it was a real case of "clutching at Buddha's feet in desperation," and it was too late. He went to the office with a glimmer of hope, but there was only a recorder there, transcribing work plans, and he was also an outsider. Xiao Long stood anxiously, pondering: Should he find a master craftsman? No, it was very late, and he must be asleep; he should let him rest well. "Forget it…" Xiao Long felt a bit discouraged. But when he thought that he was a member of the Communist Youth League, he felt that he shouldn't be like this. Moreover, the workshop director had repeatedly stated: "The current key is that the pulleys can't keep up with demand; if we don't step up our efforts and leap forward, it will affect the factory's output of machine tools." What an urgent task! He fiddled with the compass, muttering, "Five ribs, five ribs, this 'five' has really stumped me!" He grabbed his hair forcefully; this grab brought him a solution. He suddenly remembered the five-pointed star; he liked to draw it. Although he couldn't draw it well at first, he later learned geometric construction and used this method to draw it very accurately. He thought to himself: First determine five points, then connect them; wouldn't that be right? He also recalled the method of drawing four ribs, which also required finding four points first, so maybe drawing five ribs was the same way?

    He experimented several times on paper, and the result was exactly as he had thought; at this point, he almost jumped for joy. He quickly squatted down, lowered his head, hunched his back, and the tense battle began again.

    When he finished the task and walked out of the workshop, a gust of cold wind blew in his face, but he didn't feel cold. He felt warm and sweet inside. He thought: As long as you work hard and cleverly, what is there that you can't learn?

    夜作皮带轮
    湖南衡阳第二机械厂工人　阎金海
    小龙刚车好皮带轮的底箱，已是夜里十一点钟了，他迅速把车板用力地拔出来，放在一边。他膝盖微微发痛了。他站起来运动了几下，又踱了一会，倦意全没有了。
    浇注的人下班个多钟头，出砂的正忙个不赢，一股股热气冲着，一个东西翻出来了。
    小龙回过头，端详着刚车出来的生货。他笑了，他心里有说不出的幸福感。从早晨到现在，虽然两个皮带轮还没有完成，但这一个不就快成了吗？这是他几个月辛勤劳动的结晶呀！下午时候，有几个老师傅从他身边经过时，都不住地夸奖他：“这小伙子真不错，才几天，就能做多样的产品了。”他听到这些话时，心里总是热，脸上浮现着愉快的笑容；然而，他总是低着头，一声不响地做着事。
    他休息片刻，又蹲下去，顺手拿起圆规和一小块玻璃片，准备画图，可是忽然又把它放下了，浮着笑容的脸孔，一下子锁紧了眉头。他站起来，狠狠地跺着脚，自言自语地埋怨道：“唉！为什么不问一句呢？”原来他们做的皮带轮，一直是四根筋的。今天下午主任对他说：“四根筋的完成了，接着做五根筋的。”当时他正忙得气呼呼的，只啊啊应了声，也没有问问方法。这下做起来，真是“临时抱佛脚”，来不及了。他怀着一线希望到了办公室，里面只有一个纪录员在誊作业计划，可是，他也是个外行。小龙焦急地站着，思索着：找师傅吗？不行，很晚了他一定睡了，应该让他好好休息，“算了吧……”小龙心里有点打退堂鼓了。但他一想到自己是个团员，就觉得不应该这样。而且车间主任一再说明：“当前的关键就是皮带轮赶不上需要，如果不加一把劲跃上去，就会影响机床的出厂。”多么急迫的任务呀！他搬弄着圆规唠叨着：“五根筋，五根筋，这个‘五’倒把我难住了！”他用力抓了下头发，他这一抓，到抓出门道来了。他猛的想起五角星，他喜欢画它。虽然起初画不好，但后来学了几何作图，用这样方法就画得十分准确。他默想着：先确定五点，再连接起来，是不是就对头了呢？他又回忆着画四根筋的方法，也是得先找出四点，那么画五根筋大概也是这样吧？
    他又在纸上作了几次实验，结果和他想的完全一样，这一下，他简直要跳起来了。他赶忙蹲下来，低着头，弯着腰，紧张的战斗又开始了。
    当他完成任务走出车间时，扑面一股冷风吹来，但他并不感到冷。他心里热烘烘的、甜蜜蜜的。他想：凡事只要巧干苦干，还有什么学不会的呢？
