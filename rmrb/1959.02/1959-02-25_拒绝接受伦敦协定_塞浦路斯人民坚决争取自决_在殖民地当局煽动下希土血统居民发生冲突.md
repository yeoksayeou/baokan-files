　　(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to NCNW: Greek newspapers reporting news from Cyprus indicate that the London Agreement on the Cyprus issue has now intensified the tense situation in Cyprus.

　　According to "News," the meetings between the Cypriot people and the political prisoners released by the British authorities on the 22nd have turned into mass demonstrations for self-determination.

　　Groups of people welcomed the political prisoners, shouting, "Long live self-determination!"

　　According to reports, under the incitement of the colonial authorities, conflicts broke out between British and Turkish residents and Greek residents.

　　The "News" wrote in another message from Nicosia that the London Agreement has angered the Cypriots. The newspaper's reporter wrote: "Some of the people I met cried and said: 'Our ending is the same as the beginning.' Only the upper conservatives expressed satisfaction. Among those in charge, there is a prevailing view that this agreement betrays justice and destroys the hopes of the Cypriot people."

　　"Dawn Daily" wrote: "The Greek residents of Cyprus treat the (London) Agreement with anxiety because they have been betrayed. The only person in Cyprus who officially supports this agreement is the new U.S. consul in Nicosia, who demands the immediate implementation of this agreement."

　　"Athenian" believes that the Greek residents of Cyprus will not compromise, and they will fight for their own rights.

　　"Freedom" wrote: "The Cypriot people have been dragged into the trap of 'independence.' The London Agreement is unacceptable because it deprives the indivisible right to self-determination of cultured people with thousands of years of national and political traditions."

　　Bishop Kiprianos, Vice-President of the Cypriot Orthodox Council, said on the evening of the 21st that the agreement on Cyprus "lacks moral and national foundation" and that it "undermines the basic, internationally recognized right to self-determination, and therefore, its life will not be long."

　　On the evening of the 23rd, the British government published a plan on Cyprus in the form of a white paper. The main points of this plan are: First, Britain has obtained absolute sovereignty over its military bases on the island of Cyprus; second, Britain, Greece, and Turkey will impose a so-called "Treaty of Guarantee to Cyprus" on Cyprus so that these three countries can intervene separately or jointly in the basic rights of Cyprus, including Cyprus' independence, territorial integrity, and the right to formulate a constitution. In addition to military issues, Cyprus' sovereignty in other aspects such as diplomacy and security will also be controlled by these three ruling countries. Third, Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey will conclude a military alliance treaty. Greece and Turkey will station troops in Cyprus. Fourth, the future constitution of Cyprus is also completely imposed on Cyprus by the three ruling countries.

　　Given that every key point of the Cyprus Constitution has been decided, the document stipulates the establishment of a joint committee in Cyprus to draft the details of the constitution with the participation of the Greek and Turkish governments.

　　A joint committee will also be established in London, with the participation of representatives from Britain, Turkey, Greece, and the two ethnic factions of Cyprus, to finalize a treaty guaranteeing the rule of Cyprus by the three countries of Britain, Greece, and Turkey.

    拒绝接受伦敦协定
    塞浦路斯人民坚决争取自决
    在殖民地当局煽动下希土血统居民发生冲突
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：希腊报纸报道的塞浦路斯消息表明，关于塞浦路斯问题的伦敦协定现在已经使塞浦路斯的紧张局势加剧。
    据“新闻报”报道，塞浦路斯人民同英国当局在22日释放的政治犯的会见，已经变成了争取自决的群众性示威游行。
    一群一群的人欢迎政治犯，并且高呼：“自决万岁！”
    据报纸报道，在殖民地当局煽动下，英国人和土耳其血统的居民同希腊血统的居民发生了冲突。
      “新闻报”在另一条来自尼科西亚的消息中写道，伦敦协定使塞浦路斯人感到愤怒。这家报纸的记者写道：“我遇到的一些人都哭着说：‘我们的结局同开始一样’。只有上层保守主义分子表示满意。负责人士中间流行着这样一种看法：这项协定背弃了正义和毁灭了塞浦路斯人民的希望。”
      “黎明日报”写道：“塞浦路斯的希腊血统居民用不安的心情对待（伦敦）协定，因为他们被出卖了。在塞浦路斯唯一正式拥护这项协定的人就是美国驻尼科西亚的新领事，他要求立即实施这项协定”。
  “雅典人报”认为，塞浦路斯的希腊血统居民不会妥协，他们将为争取自身权利而进行斗争。
      “自由报”写道：“塞浦路斯人民被拉进了‘独立’的圈套。伦敦协定是不能接受的，因为它剥夺了具有几千年民族和政治传统的有文化教养的人的不可分割的自决权。”
    塞浦路斯正教议会副议长基泼里阿诺斯主教21日晚上说，关于塞浦路斯的协定“缺乏道义和民族基础”，它“破坏了基本的、得到国际公认的自决权利，因此，它的寿命是不会长的”。
    23日晚上，英国政府以白皮书的形式发表了关于塞浦路斯的计划。这项计划的要点是：第一，英国取得了对它在塞浦路斯岛上的军事基地的绝对主权；第二，英国、希腊和土耳其将把一项所谓“对塞浦路斯的保证的条约”强加于塞浦路斯，以便这三个国家能够分别地或共同地干涉塞浦路斯的基本权利，其中包括塞浦路斯的独立、领土完整和制定宪法的权利。除了军事问题以外，在外交和安全等其他方面，塞浦路斯的主权也将由这三个统治国家来控制。第三，塞浦路斯、希腊和土耳其将缔结一项军事联盟条约。希腊、土耳其两国将在塞浦路斯驻兵。第四，塞浦路斯未来的宪法也完全是由三个统治国所强加于塞浦路斯的。
    鉴于塞浦路斯宪法的每一项要点都已经决定了，文件规定在塞浦路斯设立一个联合委员会，以便在希腊和土耳其两国政府的参加下拟定宪法草案的细节。
    还将在伦敦设立一个联合委员会，由英国、土耳其、希腊和塞浦路斯的两种民族派代表参加，以便最后确定一项保证由英国、希腊和土耳其三国统治塞浦路斯的条约。
