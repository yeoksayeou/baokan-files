    Soaring Enthusiasm, Infinite Wisdom
    Our Tianjin Correspondent
    On January 29th, this reporter visited several factories in Tianjin. Among them were steel plants casting large steel parts, textile mills increasing the production of cloth for the people, mechanical signal factories supporting the construction of national railways, and factories producing light industrial goods... Though in this brief moment, we only saw snippets, we found that everywhere there were people full of joy and enthusiasm, everywhere there were people who were simple, modest, and full of confidence. They are working selflessly in their different positions to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    Fighting at the Furnace, Overcoming the "Large-Scale" Hurdle
    When the reporter arrived at the Tianjin Steel Plant, the open-hearth furnace was tapping, and the splashing sparks illuminated the workshop of the First Steelmaking Plant. A huge overhead crane, carrying a fifty-ton steel ladle, moved towards the operation site of the large casting group in the west of the workshop. The shift leader, Bi Weitang, waved his arm from the command platform, and the casting began. The casting was a high-pressure tank for a hydraulic press, 1.2 meters in diameter and weighing 24.5 tons, standing like half an iron tower. Since the beginning of January, the sixty-plus casting workers in this group have cast more than ten kinds of large castings, such as hydraulic presses, air hammers, and rolling mills, for the Tianjin Forging Press Machine Tool Plant, Rolling Steel Plant, and Shipyard. The largest of these weighed 63 tons.
    When they accepted this batch of tasks, veteran worker Yan Lianyuan said: "We were really surprised and happy. I entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of eleven, and I'm in my fifties this year. I've never handled such a large casting. The country's ability to manufacture machinery has improved, and our casting technology must keep up!" Casting these large steel castings requires a large molding area. When the site was not big enough, they built a simple wooden shed of more than 30 square meters. Still not enough, engineer Sun Shaoli and the workers studied together and adopted the method of core assembly molding, making the molding work in sections elsewhere, and then moving them to be assembled together for casting, which saved space and improved efficiency. To ensure the completion of the large casting task, many workers moved to the factory to live.
    In January, they had completed 200 tons of casting tasks, exceeding one-third of their maximum production volume based on working area, and increasing by more than 40 tons compared to the highest production month in September last year.

    Everyone Learns from the Advanced, Everyone Strives to be the Best
    Walking into the No. 3 Yarn Workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory, one sees colorful challenge letters, response letters, and production bulletins plastered all over the corridor. Workers in white overalls worked intensely and rhythmically beside the machines. The workers taking over the shift also arrived at the factory early, studying technical innovation measures in groups of twos and threes in the rest room.
    Whether it was in the big-character posters on the wall or in the workers' conversations, the name "Gao Yunlan" was often mentioned. After inquiring, it was learned that a friendly competition of "Learning from Gao Yunlan, Catching up with Gao Yunlan, Improving Splicing Efficiency" was underway here.
    Gao Yunlan is a municipal-level labor model who can splice a thread in only 2.9 seconds, making her the fastest spinning worker in the factory. After the workers set the plan for increasing cotton yarn production by 1.66% in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year and comprehensively improving quality, they launched a competition with Gao Yunlan as the benchmark. The workers formed a simple measurement group, regularly announced the competition situation, and formed a situation where everyone strives to be the best. Many workers learned Gao Yunlan's splicing method, and efficiency generally improved. Among them, forty-four people have reached the municipal advanced level of splicing a thread in 3.5 seconds. In this competition, Gao Yunlan also humbly learned from others, improved her operations, and increased her splicing speed to 2.78 seconds, still ranking among the top in the factory.
    The soaring enthusiasm of the workers in the No. 3 Yarn Workshop is just a microcosm of the No. 2 Cotton Factory. Every corner of the factory is working hard and cleverly in full swing. The Cloth Workshop launched a competition to improve the speed of shuttle changing, and the workers of the whole factory threw themselves into the technical revolution to transform the original machinery and equipment. In January, the workers proposed 1,500 technical innovation suggestions, some of which have already been implemented. Workers in the Spinning Workshop and Repair Shop successfully trial-produced a machine for producing steel travelers, breaking through the bottleneck of the shortage of steel travelers and ensuring the high-speed operation of the spinning machines. As a result, for the January production plan of the entire factory, as of the 28th, cotton yarn had exceeded the plan by 1.62%, and cotton cloth had exceeded the plan by 2.15%.

   Heroes Are Not Afraid of Difficulties, Output Value Increases Sevenfold
    The Tianjin Signal Factory of the Electrification Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the only factory in the country producing mechanical signals, strives to increase its output value sevenfold this year. In the first month, reports of new records were sent to the factory's Party committee every day.
    In the coking workshop, the reporter met Gao Zhenzhong and Han Shucheng, the leaders of the two groups who created the latest coal washing record. When they met, they greeted each other in a challenging tone:
    "Old Gao, our group is not convinced, we have to compete again!"
    "Don't brag, Old Han, we can handle it."
    "Don't be careless, our group's slogan is very loud: 'Press down on Jia Xian Gong (group), surpass Gao Zhenzhong.'"
    "It's best to shout loudly, we have always been promoting each other and leaping forward together to ensure that the whole factory increases sevenfold."
    "Yes, we have the same goal, to ensure a good start and increase sevenfold."
    Saying that, they both laughed heartily and offered each other cigarettes. It turned out that the three groups in the key coal washing section of the workshop have been competing openly and secretly since the factory held a "Defend the Red Flag Swearing-in Conference" in the middle of the month. Gao Zhenzhong's group washed 38 tons of coal on January 14, exceeding the highest record of 35 tons last year; on the 27th, they continued to exert their efforts, arranged cyclical operations, and created a highest record of washing 52 tons of coal. Han Shucheng's group on the night shift that day was determined to catch up. They arranged the labor organization well, the carts pushed fast, the coal was hoed fast, the belt conveyor turned fast, and the coal washing machine ran fast. In the open-air cold wind, the workers were still sweating all over, and as a result, they created a new night shift record of washing 46.5 tons of coal, which was not much different from Gao Zhenzhong's group. Because the competition has been carried out enthusiastically, the current daily output of this workshop has increased by nearly one time compared to the fourth quarter of last year's Great Leap Forward.

    Staff and Workers Fully Mobilized,
        "Cooking Rice" Even Without "Rice"
    Piles of broken glass were stacked on both sides of the entrance of the Fifth Glass Factory. When the reporter visited the factory, the party branch secretary told the reporter: This was bought by many employees from waste product shops in various districts. It is these broken glasses that helped them overcome the current difficulty of insufficient main raw materials in the factory.
    The factory's main products are Cox bottles specially supplied for cultivating root nodule bacteria in rural areas, yellow medicine bottles for containing pills, and glass products such as masthead lamp covers. According to the needs of the market and the factory's production capacity after the Great Leap Forward, this year's production plan is to increase the total production value by 2.24 times compared with last year. However, one of the factory's main raw materials - soda ash - was in short supply for a while. When all the employees of the factory discussed the plan, the Party branch disclosed the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the current production to the employees, mobilized the employees to pool their wisdom and strength to find solutions. Soon, all the employees of the factory set off a mass movement of "Everyone contributes ideas, everyone innovates" to vigorously engage in raw materials. Many workers put forward suggestions for solving the raw material problem. Many employees went to waste product shops in various districts to purchase more than 100 tons of waste glass. Technician Wan Wenzao and veteran worker Yao Junqiu further successfully researched the use of edible salt instead of sodium nitrate as a co-solvent for glass solution, thus using broken glass to produce qualified Cox bottles. According to the workers' suggestions, the sales personnel not only found mirabilite in Changli County that can replace soda ash, but also found alumina, refractory clay, feldspar and other raw materials needed for producing masthead lamp covers. With the collective efforts of all the employees of the factory, after repeated studies, sawdust and anthracite were used instead of manganese powder, which solved the problem of insufficient manganese powder, a colorant indispensable for the production of yellow medicine bottles.

  Dare to Think and Dare to Do, Continuously Creating Miracles
    In the First Workshop of the Red Flag Chemical Plant, the reporter saw the snowy white, pure new products produced by the workers, such as silicic acid and sodium chloride, being manufactured in large quantities.
    The person in charge of the workshop told reporters that at the beginning of the year, the factory and workshop party organizations called on all employees to dare to think and dare to do, and take advantage of the victory to pursue and show their skills several times on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. And it pointed out that the key to production leap is to vigorously engage in new products and make rationalization proposals. All the employees of the First Workshop were full of enthusiasm. In the two days and nights of vigorously engaging in technical revolution, they produced six new products, and completed the January production plan ten days ahead of schedule on the 21st.
    On the 9th, more than 300 employees of the workshop participated in the happy, intense and hard work. The sound of gongs and drums and broadcasts reporting good news was endless all day long. The employees produced, trial-produced, and made rationalization proposals at the same time. During the trial production, they checked materials, found raw materials, built stoves, and made equipment. When they didn't understand, they held Zhuge Liang meetings for collective discussion. Workers Xu Zhentao and Liu Yongsheng traveled dozens of miles to find the ammonium water needed for the trial production of new products, and then carried and held it to the workshop. In just one day and night, the employees put forward a total of more than 920 rationalization proposals and successfully trial-produced products such as silicic acid and sodium chloride. Then, the party organization believed that it was necessary to "continuously revolutionize", and immediately made every effort to implement rationalization proposals and put new products into production. On the 11th, under the slogan of "self-proposing, self-testing, and self-solving", the workers challenged and competed among groups and individuals, picked up hammers and pliers, and personally realized the rationalization proposals they put forward. The factory also formed a commando team of about 100 people to search for waste wood and old reed mats throughout the factory, and transformed a dozen open sheds into workshops with walls, doors and windows in one day, ensuring that the six raw materials of silicic acid and other new products were put into production that day. The results were immediately visible. The production appearance of the First Workshop changed, and the daily output value exceeded more than one-half of the plan from the next day. (Attached picture)

    冲天的干劲  无穷的智慧
    本报驻天津记者
    1月29日，记者走访了天津市的一些工厂。其中有正在浇铸大型钢件的钢厂，有为人民增产纱布的纺织厂，有支援全国铁路建设的机械信号厂，有生产轻工业品的工厂……。虽然在这短暂的时刻里，我们看到的只是一些片断的镜头，但是我们发现，到处是喜气扬扬、干劲十足的人，到处是纯朴谦虚而又充满信心的人。他们正在不同的岗位上，为争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进而忘我地劳动着。奋战在炉边，攻克“大型”关
    当记者来到天津钢厂的时候，马丁炉出钢了，四溅的火花映红了第一炼钢厂的厂房。一架巨大的天车，吊着五十吨重的钢包驶向厂房西头大型铸件组的操作场地。站在指挥台上的值班长毕维堂把胳膊一挥，浇铸开始了。铸件是水压机上的高压罐，直径一公尺二，重达二十四吨半，立起来像半截铁塔。进入1月份以来，这个组的六十多名浇铸工人，已经为天津锻压机床厂、轧钢厂、造船厂等单位浇铸了水压机、空气锤、轧钢机等十几种大型铸件。其中最大的一个就有六十三吨。
    当他们接受这批任务的时候，老工人阎连元说：“我们真是又惊又喜。我从十一岁进厂学徒，今年五十几岁了，从来没有经手过这么大的铸件。国家制造机械的能力提高了，咱们的浇铸技术也要跟上！”浇铸这些大型铸钢件，需要很大的造型面积。场地不够用，他们就建立了三十多平方公尺的简易木棚。还是不够用，工程师孙绍礼和工人一起研究，采用组芯造型的方法，把造型工作在别处分段作好，然后搬了来拼凑在一起浇铸，既节省了场地，又提高了效率。为了保证大铸件任务的完成，许多工人搬到工厂来住。
    1月份，他们已完成了二百吨的铸件任务，超过了他们作业面积最大生产量的三分之一，比去年9月产量最高月份还增加了四十多吨。
    人人学先进，个个争上游
    走进国营天津第二棉纺织厂三纱场，就看见五彩缤纷的挑战书、应战书和生产捷报贴满了走廊。机器旁穿着白色工作服的工人紧张而又有节奏地劳动着。接班的工人也提早来到工厂，在休息室里，三三两两地研究技术革新措施。
    无论是墙上贴的大字报，还是工人们的谈话中，都常有“高云兰”这个名字。经过打听，才知道这里正展开一个“学高云兰，赶高云兰，提高接头操作效率”的友谊竞赛。
    高云兰是市级劳动模范，接一个头只用二点九秒，是全厂接头操作最快的一个细纱女工。当工人们订出今年第一季度棉纱的产量比去年第四季度增长1.66％，并且全面提高质量的计划以后，就以高云兰为标兵，开展了竞赛。工人们组成简易测定小组，定期公布竞赛情况，形成了人人力争上游的局面。许多工人学习了高云兰的接头操作方法，效率普遍提高，其中有四十四人接头操作速度已经达到了每接一个头用三点五秒的市级先进水平。高云兰在这场竞赛中，也虚心向别人学习，改进操作，使接头操作速度又提高到二点七八秒，仍在全厂名列前茅。
    三纱场工人的冲天干劲，只不过是国棉二厂的一个缩影。全厂每一个角落，都在热火朝天地苦干、巧干着。布场展开了提高换梭操作速度的竞赛，全厂工人投入到改造原有机器设备的技术革命热潮中。1月份，工人们提出了技术革新建议一千五百件，有些已经实现。纺场和修配厂的工人试制成功生产钢丝圈的机器，突破了缺少钢丝圈的难关，保证了细纱机的高速运转。这样，全厂1月份生产计划，到28日止，棉纱就超额完成计划1.62％，棉布超额完成计划2.15％。
  英雄不怕难，产值翻七番
    全国唯一生产机械信号的工厂——铁道部电务局天津信号厂，今年的产值要力争翻七番。在这第一个月中，新纪录的捷报就天天送到工厂党委会。
    记者在炼焦车间见到了两个创造最新洗煤纪录的组长高振忠和韩树成。他们两人一见面，就彼此用挑战的口吻来问好：
    “老高，我们小组不服气，还得比划比划看呢！”
    “别吹，老韩，我们顶得住。”
    “可别大意啊，我们组的口号叫得可响亮：‘压住贾献功（小组），超过高振忠’。”
    “叫得响最好，咱们一向是互相推动、共同跃进，保证全厂翻七番。”
    “对，咱们目标一致，保证开门红、翻七番。”
    说着，两个人都哈哈大笑，彼此敬起烟来。原来这个车间的关键——洗煤工段的三个小组自从厂里月中开了“保住红旗誓师大会”后，一直明里暗里较着劲。高振忠小组，1月14日洗煤三十八吨，超过了去年三十五吨的最高纪录；27日继续鼓足干劲，安排循环作业，创造了洗煤五十二吨的最高纪录。当天夜班的韩树成小组决心赶上去。他们安排好劳动组织，车推的快，煤锄的快，皮带运输机转的快，洗煤机开的快，在露天寒风里，工人们还全身流汗，结果创造了洗煤四六点五吨的夜班新纪录和高振忠小组已相差无几。因为竞赛热热烈烈地搞起来了，这个车间现在的日产量已经比大跃进的去年第四季度增加了近一倍。
      职工齐动员，
        无“米”也“煮饭”
    在第五玻璃厂门口两旁堆放着一筐筐的碎玻璃。当记者访问这个工厂时，党的支部书记告诉记者说：这是好多职工从各区废品商店收购来的。就是这些碎玻璃，帮助他们克服了当前工厂主要原料不足的困难。
    这个工厂的主要产品是专供农村培殖根瘤菌用的克斯瓶、装药片的黄药瓶和桅灯罩等玻璃制品。根据市场的需要和工厂大跃进后的生产能力，今年的生产计划比去年生产总值增长二点二四倍。但是，这个厂的主要原料之一——碱面，却一时供应不足。当全厂职工讨论计划时，党支部把当前生产中存在的原材料不足的困难向职工交底，发动职工群策群力想办法，很快全厂职工就掀起了一个“人人献策、个个革新”大搞原材料的群众运动。许多工人提出了解决原料问题的建议。好多职工分赴各区废品商店收购了一百多吨废玻璃，技术员万文藻和老工人姚君秋更进一步研究成功用食盐代替硝酸钠作玻璃溶液的助溶剂，因而就用碎玻璃生产出合格的克斯瓶。供销人员根据工人们的建议，不但在昌黎县找到了可以代替碱面的皮硝，还找到生产桅灯罩所需要的氧化铝以及耐火土、长石等原料。在全厂职工千方百计努力下，经过集体多次研究，又利用锯末和无烟煤代替锰粉，解决了生产黄色药瓶所不可缺少的着色剂——锰粉不足的问题。
  敢想又敢干，接连创奇迹
    在红旗化工厂第一车间，记者看到了工人们生产的雪白的纯净的新产品硅酸和氯化钠等正在大批制造出来。
    车间负责人告诉记者说，年初工厂和车间党组织号召全体职工敢想敢干，在去年大跃进的基础上趁胜追击，大显身手，翻上几番。而且指出生产跃进的关键是大搞新产品，大提合理化建议。第一车间全体职工群情振奋，在轰轰烈烈大搞技术革命的两个昼夜中，生产了六种新产品，并且在21日提前十天完成了1月份生产计划。
    在9日，车间三百多个职工都参加了愉快的紧张的苦战。报喜的锣鼓声和广播声整天不绝于耳，职工们分头边生产、边试制、边提合理化建议。在试制中，现查资料，现找原料，现砌炉灶，现搞设备，弄不懂时就开诸葛亮会，集体讨论。工人徐镇涛和刘永生奔走几十里找到了试制新产品需用的铵水后，就挑着、抱着送到车间，仅仅一个昼夜，职工们一共提出了九百二十多件合理化建议，试制成功了硅酸、氯化钠等产品。接着，党组织认为必须“不断革命”，马上全力实现合理化建议和把新产品投入生产。11日在“自提、自试、自解决”的号召下，工人们在小组和个人间挑战、比武、拿起鎯头、钳子亲手实现自己提出的合理化建议。全厂还组成了百来人参加的突击队，满厂搜寻废木板、旧苇席，一天里就把十几间敞棚改造成了有墙有门窗的车间，保证了硅酸等六种原料有着落的新产品当天投入了生产。立竿就见影，第一车间的生产面貌起了变化，第二天起日产值就超过计划二分之一以上。（附图片）
