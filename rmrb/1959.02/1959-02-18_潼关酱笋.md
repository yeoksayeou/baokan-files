Tongguan Pickled Bamboo Shoots
Niu Zhengwu

Our "Pukou - Xi'an" express train sped westward after stopping for a minute at a small station. The train announcer broadcast: "The next stop is Tongguan Station."

"It is said that Tongguan produces pickled bamboo shoots. I didn't buy any when we came. I must buy some this time. Hey, do you like them?" A young man sitting next to me said to his female companion. Judging from his accent, he seemed to be from Shanghai. The Shanghai girl was clearly attracted by the scenery outside the window and was constantly leaning against the window, looking out. At this moment, without turning her head, she said, "I don't want to eat them, but you have to get them for the people who asked you to buy them."

We had been sitting together since Luoyang, and this was the first time we had started talking. It turned out that this young man had just returned to Shanghai from Karamay a few days ago and was preparing to marry this girl, who had recently graduated from a technical school and started working. The leadership had given him a month's vacation, but he only took two weeks, intending to return after getting married and celebrating the Spring Festival. However, this girl was even more anxious. After listening to him describe the situation in Karamay, she requested the leadership to approve her working in Karamay, and decided to get married there. Her mother said, "It's the same wherever you get married, I don't object. However, since he came back from thousands of miles away, he should spend the New Year at home!" The girl said, "Well, isn't making a home there also spending the New Year at home?" So, he stayed at home for three days, and they came west. The young man was very straightforward and talked to me enthusiastically. The girl turned her head from the window and glanced at him, her face already flushed.

An old man across from us became interested in our conversation and interjected, "Comrade, where do you work?"

"Karamay..."

"Hey! Good place, good place. You are extracting oil, right? We should really thank you, our commune's tractors, locomobiles, cotton ginning factories, and flour processing plants all use the oil you extract. This year, our commune has more machines and factories than last year. Go back and tell your comrades to produce more oil!"

The young man smiled and nodded repeatedly. The girl stared at the old man with her bright eyes, excitedly, and asked:

"Old man, where are you from?"

"Me? It's almost here, I'm from Weinan." The old man said, "I'm coming back from Hubei, where I went to see my eldest son. He's in the People's Liberation Army."

"Going home for the New Year?"

"No! Coming back to participate in manure accumulation. The people in Hubei are making a big push for manure accumulation and sending manure. Needless to say, we in Weinan are also going to do the same. I only went there for a few days, and I couldn't stay any longer."

The old man's words moved us greatly. I couldn't help but look out the window: the ice on the Yellow River to the north had melted, and the river was full of spring tides; in the fields, people were coming and going to deliver manure, and the smoke from the fertilizer fires was everywhere. The spring of the greater leap forward has arrived!

The train announcer reported: Tongguan Station is approaching.

"We also have a Weinan native in Karamay." The young man then thought of the Tongguan pickled bamboo shoots. "He told me that Tongguan is not far from Weinan, and there is a local specialty there - pickled bamboo shoots, which are very delicious. Old man, can we buy some?"

"Now there are many trains, and the stopping time is short. If you don't get off the train, I'm afraid you won't be able to buy any on the platform." Then, the old man suddenly remembered something and gestured, saying, "But, don't worry, I have a way."

The train arrived at Tongguan Station, and the old man asked me to look after his belongings and got off the train first. The young man followed closely and also got off the train.

The train was about to start. The young man returned empty-handed, but the old man came back with four packages of pickled bamboo shoots tied together. We all looked at him in surprise. He smiled humorously and said, "How about it? I told you I had a way. Haha! My second son works at this station. When I was in Hubei, he sent me a letter and told me: Dad, when you come back, I'll buy you some pickled bamboo shoots. See, he just delivered them."

"Young man, take them! Two packages are for this girl and you, and two packages are for the Weinan native you mentioned and your comrades." The old man handed the pickled bamboo shoots to the young man.

"No, old man, you take them, it's New Year!" The young man and the girl declined in unison.

"Hey! Just take them. Do we lack food here? The commune cafeteria not only has many kinds of food, but also has a small shop!"

Unable to refuse the kindness, the young man and the girl accepted them gratefully and asked the old man how much each package cost, preparing to pay. The old man frowned, pretending to be angry, and said, "Look! What are you doing? If you want to pay, I won't give them to you. This is the rule here, when in Rome, do as the Romans do!"

The train sped across the Weinan Plain, flashed past Mount Hua, and soon arrived at Weinan. The old man was about to get off the train. The young man took out a large package of things from his grass bag and stuffed it into the old man's hands, saying, "Old man, this is a famous local specialty from Shanghai - five-spice beans from the City God Temple. Try them too! You can also give them to your grandchildren for the New Year." The old man shook his head slightly and accepted them. The young man and the girl warmly sent the old man to the train door...

    潼关酱笋
    牛正武
    我们乘坐的“浦口——西安”直达车在一个小站停了一分钟之后，继续向西奔驰。列车广播员广播道：前方停车站，是潼关车站。
    “据说潼关出酱笋，来时没买着，这次可要买些。喏，你喜欢吃吗？”坐在我旁边的一位年青人对他的女伴说。听他的口音，像是上海人。那位上海姑娘显然是被窗外的风景吸引住了，一直爬在窗口，向外眺望着。这时，她头也不回地说：“我才不要吃呢，可是人家托你买，你就得办到。”
    我们从洛阳同座到这里，这时才攀谈起来。原来，这位年青人前几天才从克拉玛依回上海，准备和刚从技术学校毕业参加工作不久的这位姑娘结婚。领导上给他一个月的假期，他只要了两周，预备结了婚一过春节就返回。可是，这位姑娘比他更急，听他讲了克拉玛依的情景，就请求领导批准了她到克拉玛依工作，决定到那里结婚。她妈妈说：“在哪儿结婚都一样，我不反对。可是，人家几千里回来，也该在家里过个年啊！”姑娘说：“喏，在那里成了家，不也是在家里过年吗？”就这样，他在家里呆了三天，他们就向西来了。年青人很直爽，热情地和我谈着。姑娘从窗口扭回头斜了他一眼，脸上已泛起了红晕。
    对面一位老大爷对我们的谈话发生了兴趣，插问道：“同志，你是在啥地方工作呀？”
   “克拉玛依……”
   “嘿！好地方，好地方。你是开采石油的吧？可真该感谢你们的，俺们公社的拖拉机、锅驼机、轧花厂、面粉加工厂，用的都是你们开采的油呀。今年，俺们公社里机器、工厂，要比去年添多啦，回去跟同志们讲讲，得多出油啊！”
    年青人笑着，连连点头。那位姑娘睁大着一对水灵灵的眼睛，兴奋地望着老大爷，问道：
    “老大爷，您家是哪儿的？”
    “我？快到了，是渭南的。”老大爷说：“我这是打湖北回来，看大小子去啦，他在解放军里。”
    “赶回家过年的吧？”
    “不！赶回来参加积肥呢。人家湖北大闹积肥送粪，不用说，俺渭南也闹起来了。才去了几天，我就呆不住了。”
    老大爷的话使我们非常激动。我不由得往窗外望去：北面黄河冰冻已经融解，河水泛着春潮；田野上送粪人来车往，熏肥烟火遍地。更大跃进的春天来了！
    列车广播员报告：潼关车站就要到了。
    “我们克拉玛依还有个渭南人呢。”年青人这时又想起了潼关酱笋。“就是他告诉我：离俺们渭南不远就是潼关，那儿有一种土特产——酱笋，可好吃啦。老大爷，能买到吗？”
    “现在车多，停车时间短，不出站，站台上恐怕买不上。”接着，老大爷猛然想起了什么似的，做了一下手势说：“不过，别着急，我有办法。”
    列车到了潼关车站，老大爷要我照看着东西，先下去了。年青人紧跟着也下了车。
    火车就要开动了。年青人空着手回来，老大爷却带着四包一捆的酱笋上来了。我们都惊奇地望着他，他诙谐地笑着说：“怎么样？我说我有办法吧。哈哈！我的老二在这个车站工作，我在湖北，他就去信告诉我：爸爸，回来时给你买些酱笋带着。这不是，刚才给送来啦。”
    “小伙子，带上吧！两包是这位姑娘和你的，两包给你说的那位渭南人和同志们带上。”老大爷把酱笋递给年青人。
    “不用，老大爷您带着吧，过年呢！”年青人和姑娘齐声推谢道。
    “咳！叫你带着就带着。俺们这里还少了吃？公社食堂里不光饭菜样儿多，还设有小卖部哩！”
    盛情难却，年青人和姑娘感动地收了下来，问老大爷一包多少钱，准备给钱。老大爷板起脸来，假装生气地说：“你瞧！这是干什么的？你要给钱，就不给你啦。这是俺们这儿的规矩，入乡得随乡啊！”
    列车在渭水平原上飞速地奔驰着，闪过了华山，很快地就到达了渭南。老大爷要下车了，年青人从草提包里拿出了一大包东西，塞给老大爷，说：“老大爷，这是上海有名的土特产——城隍庙的五香豆，您也尝尝鲜吧！过年，还可以给您的孙孙吃。”老大爷微微摇了摇头，收了下来。年青人和那位姑娘亲热地把老大爷送到了车门口……
