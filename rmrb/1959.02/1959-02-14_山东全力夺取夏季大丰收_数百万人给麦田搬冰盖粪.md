Shandong Goes All Out to Seize a Bumper Summer Harvest
Millions of People Carry Ice and Spread Manure on Wheat Fields

(Our newspaper, Jinan, 13th) Shandong Province's more than 57 million mu of wheat are growing vigorously. Currently, a mighty army of more than 4.7 million people engaged in wheat field management is stepping up field management with even greater vigor, striving for an even greater wheat harvest.

Topdressing and applying manure to wheat fields are the main tasks of current wheat field management. By February 2nd, the area of wheat fields topdressed throughout the province had reached more than 42 million mu, an increase of nearly 20 million mu compared to the same period last year. In view of the cold weather and frozen ground, which prevents irrigation, many areas have also carried out activities such as carrying ice to press the wheat and trampling the wheat fields in order to better preserve moisture and provide the wheat with a certain amount of water. At the same time, combined with wheat field management, various localities have also renovated 36.4 million mu of raised fields.

This year, Shandong's wheat is generally growing quite vigorously due to being mostly planted on deeply ploughed and heavily fertilized land, coupled with timely and meticulous field management. According to typical surveys in some counties, high-yielding wheat fields currently generally have five or six tillers, large-area high-yielding fields have about three tillers, and ordinary wheat fields also have one or two tillers.

The good growth of wheat is the result of the appropriate application of the leadership method of "distinguishing, checking, and doing" by party and government leaders in various localities. The so-called "distinguishing" refers to ideological debate; "checking" refers to going deep into the fields for specific inspection; "doing" refers to taking measures and working hard based on the different situations discovered during the inspection. This is a good method of organizing and educating the masses using the mass line. It not only can promptly remove ideological obstacles, boost and maintain everyone's full vigor, but also can take appropriate measures based on the different growth conditions of the wheat seedlings. Originally, some members of the Matou People's Commune in Tancheng County, seeing that the wheat seedlings were growing so well, thought that further field management was superfluous. The commune party committee organized cadres, technicians, members, and experienced farmers to "diagnose" and "inspect" in the fields. After conducting on-site inspections, they found that the first-class wheat was lacking moisture, and the second and third-class wheat was not adequately nourished. Therefore, everyone reached a consensus of thought, and then launched a wheat field management campaign centered on carrying ice to press the wheat and carrying out topdressing. After conducting on-site "diagnoses" of the wheat, Wen Shang County believed that although the county's more than 700,000 mu of wheat fields had been universally irrigated with manure slurry twice, it still could not meet the wheat's needs for fertilizer. They further boosted their efforts, carried out wheat field management, and now most of the county's wheat fields have been covered with manure again.

In the wheat field management activities, leading cadres in many places have combined labor and command. This has not only encouraged the enthusiasm of the members, but also promptly solved problems in production.

At present, while vigorously accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, communes in various localities are still taking advantage of the situation to strengthen wheat field management, striving to complete the first topdressing and the second topdressing in a short period of time, and are starting to prepare to repair water lifting tools, so that they can irrigate the greening water after the thaw.

### 山东全力夺取夏季大丰收  数百万人给麦田搬冰盖粪

    山东全力夺取夏季大丰收 
    数百万人给麦田搬冰盖粪
    本报济南13日电　山东省五千七百多万亩小麦生长旺盛。现在全省四百七十多万麦田管理大军，正以更大的劲头加强田间管理，力争小麦更大丰收。
    向麦田追肥盖粪是当前麦田管理的主要内容。到本月2日，全省经过追肥的麦田已达四千二百多万亩，比去年同时期增加将近二千万亩。根据天寒地冻不能浇水的情况，许多地区为了更好的保墒，供给小麦一定的水分，还开展了搬冰压麦和踏压麦田的活动。同时各地结合麦田管理，还整修畦田三千六百四十万亩。
    今年山东小麦由于大都种在深翻多肥的土地上，再加上田间管理及时细致，一般麦苗都长得相当旺盛。据一些县的典型调查，当前高额丰产麦田一般都长有五六个分蘖，大面积丰产田有三个左右的分蘖，一般麦田也有一两个分蘖。
    小麦长的这样好，是各地党政领导恰当的运用了“辩、查、干”领导方法的结果。所谓辩就是思想辩论；查，就是深入田间作具体检查；干，就是根据检查发现的不同情况，采取措施，大干特干。这是以群众路线的方法组织和教育群众的好方法，它不仅能及时解除思想障碍，鼓起和保持大家的饱满干劲，并且能够根据麦苗生长的不同情况采取适宜措施。郯城县码头人民公社原先有些社员看到麦苗长的那样好，认为再搞田间管理是多余的。社党委就组织干部、技术员、社员和老农到田间“会诊”“检查”，经过实地查，就地看，发现一类麦水分不足，二类麦和三类麦没有吃饱，因此大家思想认识一致了，接着就掀起了搬冰压麦和大搞追肥为内容的麦田管理运动。汶上县对小麦进行现场“诊断”后，认为全县七十多万亩麦田，虽然普遍浇了两遍粪稀，但是仍然不能满足小麦对肥分的需要，就进一步鼓足干劲，开展麦田管理，现在这个县绝大部分麦田又铺盖了一遍圈肥。
    在麦田管理活动中，许多地方的领导干部作到了劳动和指挥相结合。这样，既鼓舞了社员干劲，又及时解决了生产中的问题。
    目前，各地公社在大搞积肥造肥的同时，仍乘胜加强麦田管理，争取在短时间内追完第一遍肥，追上第二遍肥，并着手准备修理提水工具，待开冻后，就浇返青水。
