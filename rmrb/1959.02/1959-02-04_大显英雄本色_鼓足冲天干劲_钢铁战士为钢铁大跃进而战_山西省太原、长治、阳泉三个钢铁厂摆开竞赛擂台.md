Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd - Workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant, and Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant have recently begun competing under the slogan of "mutual promotion, common leap forward" for the 1959 Great Leap Forward, striving to contribute their utmost to the great task of producing 18 million tons of steel nationwide this year. New leaps forward have already begun to emerge in these three factories during the competition.

This competition was initiated by the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant (formerly the Guxian Iron and Steel Plant). At the beginning of January this year, workers at the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant challenged the workers of Taigang with the condition of completing this year's leap forward plan earlier, better, and more comprehensively. Workshops and departments such as iron smelting, steel rolling, refractory materials, coking, and steelmaking, as well as units such as canteens, also issued letters of challenge to corresponding units in Taigang. After receiving the challenge letters, workers in various factories and workshops of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company held discussions, proposed new planned targets and competition conditions, and responded to the challenges. In order to do a good job in the inter-factory competition, the coking workshop of the company's coking plant also launched competitions between shifts and groups. After receiving the letters of acceptance, the workers of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant decided to carry out technical revolution and tap production potential to ensure the completion of their challenge plan. Workers at the Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant also participated in the competition. Their slogan is: "Mobilize all workers in the plant, work hard and cleverly in 1959. Triple steel production, complete the annual target in September. Production and construction are all good, surpassing Changgang and Taigang."

In the past few days, the workers in these three factories have been actively looking for ways and taking various measures to realize the leap forward plan, and the competition is in full swing.

"Hard work plus clever work, using ingenuity to defeat the opponent" is a prominent feature of the current competition movement in these three factories. Many workshops and groups in these three factories are carrying out technical revolutions and tapping production potential. Workers in several units of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have already completed their January production plans ahead of schedule by adopting effective technical measures around key production points. The workers of the forging steel department of the Second Steel Rolling Plant of this company carried out a technical innovation movement in production, adopted more than 30 technical measures around key production points, created 16 new production records in a row, and completed the monthly production plan ahead of schedule on January 24. The workers of the small-scale steel rolling workshop of the First Steel Rolling Plant tapped production potential and produced 830 tons of steel, overfulfilling the January production plan in just 20 days. After putting forward the competition challenge, the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant launched a vigorous technical revolution. Workers throughout the plant put forward 4,107 rationalization proposals, and 1,852 of them have been applied to production. Workers in the rolling mill used waste materials to make positive collars and steel-running trough frames to replace manual steel feeding, improving production efficiency by 10%, which can produce an additional 6,750 tons of steel per year. Workers in the steelmaking workshop also took measures to increase the pass rate of steelmaking from 98% in the past to 100%. Workers in the refractory materials workshop, in response to the extreme shortage of steelmaking taphole bricks, created an advanced method of using water glass instead of kiln firing to make water glass fire bricks, which can save 18,000 labor days and 3,000 tons of raw coal throughout the year, and more importantly, meet the needs of steelmaking production. The workers in the coking workshop made an automated door lifting machine for coking, which reduced the labor intensity of the workers and created conditions for increasing coke production. After putting forward the slogan of completing the annual production plan one quarter ahead of schedule, the Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant also started with technical reforms, actively improving production operation technology and improving production level. Under the condition of insufficient raw materials, the iron output of No. 1 blast furnace in this factory on January 28 increased three times compared with the average daily output from January 1 to 27, and increased by 66% compared with the planned output. The utilization coefficient reached 2.14. (Attached photo)

### 大显英雄本色　鼓足冲天干劲  钢铁战士为钢铁大跃进而战  山西省太原、长治、阳泉三个钢铁厂摆开竞赛擂台

    大显英雄本色　鼓足冲天干劲
    钢铁战士为钢铁大跃进而战
    山西省太原、长治、阳泉三个钢铁厂摆开竞赛擂台
    据新华社太原3日电　太原钢铁公司、长治钢铁厂、阳泉钢铁厂的职工最近在“相互促进、共同跃进”的口号下，擂起了1959年大跃进的竞赛战鼓，争先要为今年全国产钢一千八百万吨的伟大任务尽最大的力量。这三个厂在竞赛中已开始出现新的跃进局面。
    这个竞赛是由长治钢铁厂（原故县钢铁厂）发起的。今年1月初，长治钢铁厂的职工以更大、更好、更全面地提前完成今年跃进计划为条件，向太钢职工挑战。这个工厂的炼铁、轧钢、耐火、炼焦、炼钢等车间和科室部门与食堂等单位，也分别向太钢的同工种单位发出了挑战书。太原钢铁公司各厂、车间职工在接到挑战书以后，纷纷举行座谈，提出新的计划指标和竞赛条件，向对方应战。这个公司的焦化厂炼焦车间，为了搞好厂际竞赛，全车间还开展了班与班、组与组的竞赛。长治钢铁厂的职工接到应战书以后，决定大搞技术革命，挖掘生产潜力，保证完成自己的挑战计划。阳泉钢铁厂的职工也参加了竞赛。他们的口号是：“全厂职工总动员，大干巧干五九年。钢铁产量加三番，全年指标九月完。生产建设样样好，超过长钢和太钢。”
    这几天，这三个厂的工人们都积极寻找办法，采取各种措施实现跃进计划，竞赛正在热烈展开中。
    “苦干加巧干，以巧胜对方”，是这三个厂目前竞赛运动的显著特点。这三个厂的许多车间、小组都在大搞技术革命，挖掘生产潜力。太原钢铁公司好几个单位的职工，由于围绕生产关键采取了有效的技术措施，已经早就提前完成了1月份生产计划。这个公司的第二轧钢厂锻钢部的职工，在生产中开展了技术革新运动，围绕生产关键，采取了三十多项技术措施，连创十六次
  生产新纪录，提前在1月24日完成全月生产计划。第一轧钢厂小土型
  轧钢车间的职工，大挖生产潜力，
  生产了八百三十吨钢材，只用了二十天的时间就超额完成了1月份生
  产计划。长治钢铁厂在提出竞赛挑战以后，就开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革命，全厂工人提出了四千一百零七条合理化建议，并且已有一千八百五十二条应用到生产中。轧钢车间职工用废料制成了正围盘和跑钢的槽架子代替人工喂钢，提高了生产效率10％，这样一年即可多产钢材六千七百五十吨。炼钢车间职工也采取措施，使炼钢的合格率由过去98％提高到百分之百。耐火材料车间的职工，针对炼钢流钢砖极端缺乏的情况，创造了用水玻璃代替烧窑的先进方法，制成了水玻璃火砖，全年可节约一万八千个劳动
  日和三千吨原煤，更重要的是适应了炼钢生产的需求。炼焦车间的职工制成了炼焦自动化提门机，减轻了工人劳动强度，为增产焦炭创造
  了条件。阳泉钢铁厂提出提前一个季度完成全年生产计划的口号以后，也从技术改革方面入手，积极改进生产操作技术，提高生产水平。在原材料不大充足的条件下，这个厂的一号高炉1月28日的产铁量，比1日至27日的平均日产量提高了三倍，比计划产量提高了66％，利用系数达到了二点一四。（附图片）
    本溪钢厂轧钢车间超额完成了1月份生产计划。钢材产量完成跃进计划102.33％，比去年同时期的产量翻了一番还多。这是轧钢工人在轧制钢材
