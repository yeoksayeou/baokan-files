Yunnan Begins Sowing Cotton

(Report from this newspaper) Broad areas of Yunnan Province have begun sowing cotton. As of the end of January, incomplete statistics from nine special districts (autonomous prefectures) including Dehong, Simao, Lijiang, Chuxiong, and Yuxi, show that a total of 81,581 mu of cotton have been sown.

This year, Yunnan Province plans to plant one million mu of cotton, double that of last year, with a planned total output of 600,000 dan. Because various localities started early, the sowing quality is generally good. The cotton fields have been deeply ploughed, with an average of more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and overwintering pests have generally been eliminated once. As a result of water conservancy construction, 80% of the cotton fields can achieve more than 400 cubic meters of water per mu.

During this sowing, various localities generally adhered to the province's cotton technical operating procedures, achieving abundant fertilizer, fine soil, and appropriate close planting. In order to achieve improved varieties as much as possible, seeds were selected by grain, fumigated, and treated with pesticides. Yuanjiang County specifically trained 566 technicians to persist in implementing various technical measures. Some areas established cotton field management professional teams immediately after sowing to manage each mu as it is planted, ensuring full and strong seedlings. Xiangyun, Lincang and other places where the season is later are currently actively preparing the land for sowing.

    云南开始播种棉花
    本报讯　云南省广大地区已经开始棉花播种。到1月底止，据德宏、思茅、丽江、楚雄、玉溪等九个专区（自治州）的不完全统计，共种下棉花八万一千五百八十一亩。
    今年，云南省计划种植棉花一百万亩，比去年扩大一倍，总产量计划达到六十万担。由于各地动手较早，播种质量一般较好，棉田经过深翻，平均每亩有肥料一万斤以上，并普遍消灭过一次越冬虫害。由于兴修水利的结果，80％的棉田可以达到每亩有水四百方以上。
    这次播种中，各地一般都坚持了全省棉花技术操作规程，做到肥多、土细、适当密植。为了尽可能做到良种化，籽种都进行了粒选、熏蒸和药物拌种。元江县为了坚持贯彻各项技术措施，特意训练了五百六十六个技术员。有的地区在播种后，跟着就成立了棉田管理专业队，做到种一亩管一亩，保证全苗壮苗。季节较晚的祥云、临沧等地，目前也正积极整地，准备播种。
