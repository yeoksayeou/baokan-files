    Launch a Mass Movement Centered on Technical Revolution
    The Fundamental Way to Improve Labor Productivity
    1958 was a year of unprecedented great leap forward in Shanghai's industrial production. Based on the achievements already made last year, conscientiously summarizing the experiences of carrying out the technical revolution, and further extensively and deeply carrying out the technical revolution movement will surely guarantee the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    Last year's practical experience proves that to launch a mass movement of technical revolution requires us to be good at starting from the city's industrial foundation and the requirements of developing production, and linking it with the specific production tasks of each enterprise in each period. On the one hand, we must adopt the latest technological achievements as much as possible and popularize and adopt new technologies that have been tested; on the other hand, we must combine them with the most extensive mass-based technological innovation. On the one hand, we must start from the production tasks and technical foundation of each enterprise in each period to ensure the completion of the current production plan; on the other hand, we must be good at combining the solution of current production key points with the requirements of more significant scientific research in the factory and industry, and combine the realization of local technological innovation with relatively systematic technological transformation. Only in this way, by combining the big and the small, the near and the far, can the technical revolution serve current production and promote a greater leap forward in production.
    Last year's practical experience tells us that the process of carrying out a mass technical revolution movement is also a process of constantly breaking superstitions and liberating the mind. On the one hand, it reforms machines and tools, and on the other hand, it also transforms people's thinking. The technical revolution is the antithesis of conservative thinking, dogmatism, and empiricism. The development of the movement is full of ideological struggles between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward. Last year's practice basically broke two superstitions: one is that the working masses broke the superstition that technology is unattainable and the sense of inferiority of underestimating their own strength, and the other is that technicians began to break the superstition of books, belittling the practical experience of the working people, and national inferiority. In the process of practice, people create various tools and equipment based on the natural laws they recognize and master to carry out technical revolution activities; and from the technical revolution activities, people explore newer and more knowledge of natural laws, so that people more consciously grasp natural laws and create more amazing miracles of technological innovation.
    Last year's practical experience also proved that technical revolution should not be just a small fuss, but a big fuss; it should not be a fuss by a few people, but a fuss by the broad masses. The key lies in carrying out mass movements on a large scale. Only by truly forming a broad mass movement can the enthusiasm of the masses be fully mobilized and the wisdom of the masses be concentrated to the greatest extent. Some leading cadres of enterprises do not pay attention to the technical innovation suggestions of the masses, thinking that these are "small things," but they do not know that big things are the concentration and development of these small things. Some people are afraid that the technical innovation suggestions of the masses will disrupt their schedule of directing production in an orderly manner, so they would rather "govern" than "disturb," rather than seek governance from disturbance, and organize active balance from imbalance. People with this kind of thinking are always far away from the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses is like an unopened treasure chest that has not been displayed, so the technical revolution is carried out coldly and sparsely.
    To make the technical revolution a widespread mass movement, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of combining labor and technology, theory and practice, and under the leadership of the Party, implement the "three-in-one combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians. The working masses have rich labor experience, their creative wisdom is endless, the experience accumulated by the working masses in long-term labor practice is very valuable, and they are the main force of the technical revolution. But we should also see that emphasizing the experience of the working masses in labor practice does not mean that we can ignore technical theory or the role of technicians. On the contrary, we should attach great importance to the guiding role of technical theory for labor practice and the active role that technicians should play in the technical revolution. Many major technological innovation projects created last year were often successfully tested with the close cooperation of workers and technicians. Workers and technicians combine rich labor experience with correct technical theory in production practice, learn from each other, and complement each other's strengths to more effectively promote the development of the technical revolution.

    Give Full Play to the Wisdom and Talents of the Masses
    The fundamental purpose of our revolution is to liberate and develop social productive forces, so as to build socialism and transition to communism.
    Technical revolution is endless, and it is completely opposed to outdated and conservative technical viewpoints. Therefore, the primary condition for technical revolution is to liberate the mind. A communist must not only have the firm will to dare to fight against nature and constantly explore the laws of production and the mysteries of matter, but also have the revolutionary courage to wage a resolute struggle against his own and others' conservative superstitious thoughts.
    Breaking superstitions is to truly respect, explore, and master science, and it is to break those pseudo-scientific and unscientific things. For real science and some things that are still scientific, not only can they not be broken, but they must be protected. Some comrades have misunderstandings about the slogan of liberating the mind, such as when reforming rules and regulations and innovating technology, they uncritically treat some still reasonable rules and regulations and some things that meet the requirements of scientific laws as "superstitions" and break them. It seems that "liberating the mind" can negate everything, which is very wrong and dangerous. Our victory lies in being able to act according to science, and all successful creations in technical revolution are no exception. Science is a summary of people's understanding of the laws of objective things through social and production practice. The richer the practice, the more and deeper the understanding of objective laws, and science will continue to develop and be mastered by people. Therefore, in production activities, people who are superstitious in this way and superstitious in that way, and regard the achievements that predecessors have reached as an insurmountable limit, bind themselves, and underestimate themselves are conservatives and cannot talk about technical revolution or invention and creation. Only those who are full of passion for building socialism, inspire the revolutionary vigor to the sky, and engage in production and work with full confidence can quickly master science and technology and contribute to the technical revolution.
    Under the socialist system, technical revolution is a true mass revolution. It requires mobilizing the broad masses and involving them in this great revolutionary movement. Only in this way can this revolution converge into a sea, be magnificent, be lively and colorful, and be carried out comprehensively and deeply, and the endless wisdom and talents of the broad masses can be brought into play. Any idea and practice of limiting the technical revolution to a small circle of technicians, experts, and scientists is incorrect. Of course, the important role of scientists, experts, and technicians cannot be ignored, and necessary measures should be taken to combine them with the broad masses in order to better play their expertise.
(Excerpted from the Heilongjiang "Struggle" magazine's fourth issue editorial: "Hold the Red Flag of Technical Revolution Higher.")
      We Must Establish the Viewpoint of Relying on the Masses
    Over the past year, the mass movement to reform tools in our province has achieved great success. From agricultural production to agricultural product processing, from industry to transportation, a series of technological innovations have been carried out. The popularization and use of a large number of new and improved tools have greatly reduced labor intensity, improved labor productivity, and saved a lot of labor, which has largely solved the problem of labor shortage, thus ensuring the realization of the leap forward plan for industrial and agricultural production. However, in our province's industrial and agricultural production, heavy manual labor still accounts for a considerable proportion. This technically backward situation is not commensurate with the situation of a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture, and it is even further from the requirements of realizing mechanization and electrification. According to the practical experience of 1958, to solve the problem of labor shortage, we must start from many aspects: improve labor organization, rationally allocate and use labor; carry out large-scale cooperation between regions and industries, and adjust labor surpluses and shortages, etc. But the most fundamental way is to deeply mobilize the masses, give full play to the infinite wisdom and creativity of the broad masses, and vigorously implement tool reform, so as to gradually realize the replacement of manual labor with mechanical operation and continuously improve the degree of mechanization. Everyone knows that the stronger the degree of mechanization, the higher the labor efficiency, which can not only save a lot of labor, but also greatly reduce labor intensity and shorten labor time. The important significance of making a big fuss about technical innovation is not only to solve the current contradiction of labor shortage, but also to prepare conditions for the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization and rural electrification in our country. It can be seen that continuing to carry out a wider and deeper mass tool reform movement not only has practical significance, but also has far-reaching political and economic significance.
    The practice of the past year proves that carrying out the tool reform movement, like other movements, runs through the struggle between two lines and two methods. It should be pointed out that the technical revolution we are carrying out is to serve socialist construction with science and technology, so we must never deviate from the current political tasks or the Party's general line of building socialism, otherwise we will lose our way and go down the wrong path of "technology for technology's sake." Therefore, throughout the entire process of tool reform, we must strengthen the Party's leadership, educate the broad masses of cadres and people to establish the viewpoint that technology serves politics and serves production. Technology is to be mastered by people, and tools are to be created and used by people; whether we can master and develop technology, whether we can skillfully drive production tools, and fully exert their effectiveness depends on people. Therefore, throughout the entire process of tool reform, we cannot be separated from mobilizing the masses and the Party's political and ideological work, but must carry out in-depth ideological education so that people can fully understand the great significance of carrying out technical revolution and tool reform, eliminate all ideological obstacles that hinder the development of the movement, and establish the spirit of daring to think and act and not being afraid of difficulties or setbacks. In the tool reform movement, we must carry out the struggle between the two lines and two methods of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive.
    In the tool reform movement, we must firmly establish the viewpoint of believing in and relying on the masses, and conscientiously follow the mass line in our work. Guiding the masses to constantly find tricks and think of ways in conquering nature and production labor, so as to accumulate and enrich science and technology, and continuously improve technical operations and improve production tools, can promote the continuous development of production. This has been fully proven by the practice of the Great Leap Forward last year. In the past year, more than 10,000 new types of agricultural tools manufactured in various parts of our province were mostly created by the working people. Therefore, any thought and practice that ignores the infinite wisdom and creativity of the broad working masses and relies solely on a few experts and technicians is wrong and is bound to make mistakes. Of course, we cannot underestimate the role of experts and technicians, but must give full play to their role in the technical revolution.
    In the tool reform movement, we must also closely integrate creation and promotion to promote the continuous development of the mass movement and make the movement achieve widespread results. The relationship between creation and promotion is essentially the relationship between improvement and popularization. Failure to improve the creation of the masses and keep the efficiency of the tools in an unstable state and at a very low level is not conducive to promotion. Therefore, it is wrong to only pay attention to creation and not to improvement. But we should also see that the purpose of creation and improvement is to promote and popularize. If there is only creation and improvement, but no attention is paid to promotion and popularization, the meaning of creation and improvement is lost. In fact, only on the basis of promotion and popularization can there be creation and improvement. Without this basis, creation and improvement are unimaginable. Because without promotion and popularization, the effectiveness of tool reform cannot be seen, nor can the shortcomings of new tools be seen, and how to improve them, so there can be no new creation and improvement. It can be seen that the relationship between creation and promotion, improvement and popularization is a key issue for the continuous innovation of technology and the continuous forward development of the technical innovation movement, and we must pay greater attention to it.

### 开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动

    开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动
    提高劳动生产率的根本途径
    1958年，是上海工业生产空前大跃进的一年。在去年已取得成就的基础上，认真总结开展技术革命的经验，进一步广泛深入地开展技术革命运动，就一定能保证不断提高劳动生产率，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
    去年的实践经验证明，要开展技术革命的群众运动，要求我们善于从全市工业基础和发展生产的要求出发，并和各个企业在各个时期的具体生产任务联系起来。一方面要尽可能地采用现有最新的技术成就，普遍推广和采用经过试验的新技术；另方面又必须与最广泛地发挥群众性技术革新相结合。一方面要从各个企业各个时期的生产任务和技术基础出发，以保证当前生产计划的完成；另方面又要善于把解决当前生产关键与本厂本行业较重大的科学研究的要求结合起来，把实现局部的技术革新和比较系统的技术改造结合起来。只有这样大小、远近结合，才能使技术革命为当前生产服务，推动生产的更大跃进。
    去年的实践经验告诉我们，开展群众性技术革命运动的过程，也是不断破除迷信解放思想的过程。它一方面改革着机器和工具，另方面也改造着人们的思想。技术革命是保守思想、教条主义和经验主义的对立物，运动的发展过程充满着新与旧、先进与落后的思想斗争。去年的实践，基本上破除了两种迷信：一种是劳动群众打破了技术高不可攀的迷信和对自己力量估计不足的自卑感，一种是技术人员开始打破了迷信书本、轻视劳动人民的实践经验和民族自卑感。人们在实践过程中，根据自己所认识和掌握的自然规律，创造出各种工具和设备，来进行技术革命的活动；而从技术革命活动中，又使人们探索到更新更多的自然规律的知识，使人们更自觉地掌握自然规律，创造了更多技术革新的惊人奇迹。
    去年的实践经验还证明了：技术革命不能只是小闹，而应该是大闹，不应该是少数人闹，而应该是广大群众一起闹，其关键，则在于大搞群众运动。只有真正形成广泛的群众运动，才能把群众的积极性最充分地调动起来，也才能最大限度地把群众的智慧加以集中。有些企业领导干部不重视群众点点滴滴的技术革新建议，以为这是“小事情”，而不知道大事情正是这些小事情集中和发展起来的。有些人怕群众的技术革新建议会打乱他们按部就班指挥生产的日程表，因此宁“治”毋“乱”，而不是从乱中求治，从不平衡中组织积极的平衡，有这种思想的人，总是远远地脱离了群众，群众的积极性好像未开启的百宝箱一样没有施展出来，因而使技术革命搞得冷冷清清。
    要使技术革命成为广泛的群众运动，必须坚持劳动与技术、理论与实践相结合的方针，在党的领导下，实行领导干部、工人和技术人员的三结合。工人群众有着丰富的劳动经验，他们的创造智慧是无穷无尽的，工人群众在长期劳动实践中积累的经验是十分宝贵的，他们是技术革命的主力。但我们也应该看到，重视工人群众劳动实践的经验，并不是说可以忽视技术理论，可以忽视发挥技术人员的作用。恰恰相反，我们应该十分重视技术理论对于劳动实践的指导作用，重视技术人员在技术革命中发挥应有的积极作用。去年创造出来的许多重大的技术革新项目，往往是在工人和技术人员密切合作下试验成功的。工人和技术人员在生产实践中，使丰富的劳动经验和正确的技术理论相结合，相互学习，取长补短，才能更有效地推动技术革命的发展。
  （摘自上海“解放”杂志第四期评论：“更广泛、更深入地开展群众性的技术革命运动”。）
    充分发挥群众的聪明才智
    我们革命的根本目的在于解放与发展社会生产力，以便建成社会主义并过渡到共产主义。
    技术革命是无止境的，它与陈旧过时的保守的技术观点是完全对立的。因此，技术革命的首要条件是解放思想，一个共产主义者，不仅要有勇于与自然界作斗争，经常探索生产规律、物质奥秘的坚强意志，而且首先要有与自己和别人的保守迷信思想进行坚决斗争的革命胆略。
    破除迷信是为了真正尊重、探索和掌握科学，它是要破除那些伪科学、不科学的东西。对于真的科学和某些还合乎科学的东西，不仅不能破除，而且必须加以保护。某些同志对解放思想的口号有误解，如当改革规章制度及革新技术时，不加分析地把一些仍然合理的规章制度、一些合乎科学规律要求的东西当作“迷信”破除了，似乎“解放思想”就可以否定一切，这是十分错误和危险的。我们的胜利在于能够依据科学行事，技术革命上一切成功的创造，亦莫不如此。科学是人们通过社会与生产的实践对客观事物规律性的认识的总结，实践越丰富，对客观规律的理解也就越多越深，科学也将不断发展和为人们所掌握。因此，在生产活动中迷信这样，迷信那样，把前人已经达到的成就看成不可超越的极限，束手束脚，妄自菲薄的人，这是保守派，谈不到什么技术革命，发明创造。只有那些满怀建设社会主义的激情，鼓起冲天的革命干劲，信心百倍地从事生产和工作的人，才能迅速地掌握科学技术，才能在技术革命中作出贡献。
    在社会主义制度下，技术革命是一个真正的人民群众革命。它要求把广大群众发动起来，把他们卷进这个伟大的革命运动中来。只有这样，这个革命才能百川汇海，波澜壮阔，有声有色，全面、深入地开展下去，广大群众无穷尽的聪明才智才能发挥出来。任何把技术革命限制在技术人员、专家、科学家等一部分人的狭小的圈子里的想法和作法，都是不正确的。当然，对科学家、专家、技术人员的重要作用也不能忽视，要采取必要的措施使他们与广大群众结合起来，以便更好的发挥他们的专长。
    （摘自黑龙江“奋斗”杂志第四期社论：“更高地举起技术革命的红旗”。）
      必须树立依靠群众的观点
    一年来我省改革工具的群众运动，取得了很大的成就。从农业生产到农产品加工，从工业到运输，都进行了一系列的技术革新。大量新式工具和改良工具的推广和使用，大大地减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率，大量地节省了劳动力，在很大程度上解决了劳力不足的问题，从而保证了工农业生产跃进计划的实现。但是，在我省工农业生产上，笨重的手工劳动还占着相当大的比重。这种技术落后的状况，同工农业更大跃进的形势是不相称的，同实现机械化、电气化的要求就相差更远。据1958年的实践经验，解决劳动力不足的问题，必须从多方面着手：改善劳动组织，合理调配和使用劳力；开展地区、行业间的大协作，调剂劳力余缺等等。但最根本的办法，还是深入发动群众，发挥广大群众无穷的智慧和创造性，大力实行工具改革，以便逐步实现以机械操作代替手工劳动，不断提高机械化的程度。大家都知道，机械化的程度愈强，劳动效率就愈高，不仅能大量地节省劳动力，而且可以大大降低劳动强度，缩短劳动时间。大闹技术革新的重要意义，还不仅仅在于解决当前劳动力不足的矛盾，而且将为我国逐步实现农业机械化、农村电气化准备条件。由此可见，继续不断地开展更广泛更深入的群众性的工具改革运动，不仅有着现实意义，而且有着深远的政治意义和经济意义。
    一年来的实践证明，开展工具改革运动，也同其他运动一样，贯穿着两条路线、两种方法的斗争。应该指出，我们所进行的技术革命，是要科学技术为社会主义建设服务，因而就绝不应当离开当前的政治任务，离开党的建设社会主义的总路线，否则就会迷失方向，走向“为技术而技术”的错误道路。因此，在工具改革的整个过程中，必须加强党的领导，教育广大干部和群众树立技术为政治服务、为生产服务的观点。技术是要人掌握的，工具是要人来创造和使用的；能不能掌握和发展技术，能不能熟练地驾驭生产工具，充分地发挥它的效能，决定于人。因此，在工具改革的整个过程中，都不能离开发动群众，离开党的政治思想工作，而是必须进行深入的思想教育，使人们充分地认识进行技术革命、开展工具改革的重大意义，扫除一切阻碍运动发展的思想障碍，树立敢想敢作和不怕困难、不怕挫折的精神。在工具改革运动中，必须开展多快好省与少慢差费两条路线、两种方法的斗争。
    在工具改革运动中，必须坚定地树立相信群众、依靠群众的观点，在工作中认真走群众路线。引导群众在征服自然和生产劳动中不断地找窍门、想办法，从而积累和丰富科学技术，不断地改进技术操作和改进生产工具，就能够促进生产不断地向前发展。这已为去年大跃进的实践充分证明。在去年一年中，我省各地所制造的一万多种新式农具，绝大部分是劳动人民创造出来的。因此，任何忽视广大劳动群众的无穷智慧和创造力，单纯依靠少数专家、技术人员的思想和作法都是不对的，都是必然要犯错误的。当然，我们也不能轻视专家、技术人员的作用，而是要充分发挥他们在技术革命中的作用。
    在工具改革运动中，还必须把创造和推广两者密切地结合起来，以推动群众运动的不断发展，并使运动收到广泛的效果。创造和推广的关系，实质上就是提高和普及的关系。不把群众的创造加以提高，使工具的效率停留在不稳定的状态和很低的水平上，是不利于推广的，因此，只注意创造不注意提高是不对的。但是我们也应该看到，创造和提高的目的，正是为了推广和普及，如果只有创造和提高，而不注意推广和普及，就失去了创造和提高的意义。事实上，只有在推广和普及的基础上才能有创造和提高，离开了这个基础，创造和提高是难以想像的。因为不经过推广普及，就看不出工具改革的功效，也看不出新的工具存在哪些缺点，以及如何改进，这样也就不可能有新的创造和提高。由此可见，创造同推广、提高同普及的关系问题，对于技术的不断革新，对于技术革新运动的不断向前发展，是一个带有关键性的问题，必须引起我们更大的重视。
