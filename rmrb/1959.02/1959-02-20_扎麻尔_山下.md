Under the "Zhamar" Mountain
By Our Correspondent Feng Ye

The agricultural and pastoral collectivization movement in Mongolia developed rapidly in 1958. Its speed and scale of development were unprecedented. This is a major achievement made by the Mongolian people in 1958, and it will greatly promote the further development of agricultural and pastoral production.

When the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held its Thirteenth Congress in March last year, only 35% of the pastoral households nationwide had joined cooperatives. The Thirteenth Congress made further development of cooperatives an important task of the 1958-1960 three-year plan, and decided that most pastoral households should join cooperatives within three years. This call from the Mongolian Party was immediately supported by the majority of herdsmen, and the agricultural and pastoral collectivization movement quickly unfolded on the grasslands. The number of pastoral households joining cooperatives increased day by day. According to recent statistics, it has reached 75% of the total pastoral households. This means that in less than a year, the number of pastoral households joining cooperatives has more than doubled. This is a very rapid development. Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister Tseden stated that the country will realize pastoral collectivization this year, completing the tasks of the three-year plan ahead of schedule.

After the herdsmen were organized, they fully demonstrated their advantages in strengthening livestock breeding management, resisting natural disasters, and breeding livestock, which promoted the development of animal husbandry production. Last year, Mongolia increased its livestock by more than 100,000 head. Among them, cooperatives increased livestock by 6% compared with the previous year, while individual herdsmen decreased by 3%. This fact vividly shows the benefits of collectivization, and at the same time encourages herdsmen to organize more actively.

Here, let us look at the prosperous production and improved life in the Mongolian pastoral areas from the development of a cooperative.

On a clear day, we took a car from Ulaanbaatar to the "Zhamar" cooperative in the Central Province for an interview. The grasslands on both sides of the road were covered with white snow. From time to time, we saw groups of cattle, horses, and sheep wandering in the cold wind and on the snow, licking snow and eating grass. The car crossed several mounds and arrived at the "Zhamar" cooperative, it was already late.

Although we arrived at an inconvenient time, the director of the cooperative had gone to the South Gobi Province for business, the cadres and members of the cooperative warmly received us. We were accommodated in the newly built guest house. The heated wall was very warm, and the cooperative's power station supplied electricity on time, making the room brightly lit. After drinking two bowls of milk tea, the cold from the journey disappeared.

In this warm and bright house, we sat around the stove and chatted with the cooperative members, who kindly introduced us to the past and present of the cooperative.

The "Zhamar" cooperative has been established for four years. Initially, there were only eighteen pastoral households, with a total of more than 2,700 livestock. In the past four years, livestock has been increasing year after year, and the plan has been completed year after year. Therefore, many pastoral households have joined the cooperative successively. Due to the development of production, another smaller cooperative was also merged into this cooperative this year. Now, the entire cooperative has expanded to 224 households, and the number of livestock has increased to 19,100.

In the process of production over the past few years, the members have well understood that in order to better develop animal husbandry, it is necessary to combine it with agriculture. The cooperative has planted grains, feed crops, and vegetables, which not only meets the needs of the members for food and vegetables, but also increases artificial feed, providing a material basis for livestock to safely overwinter. Therefore, the cultivated area of the cooperative is expanding year by year. In 1957, the entire cooperative planted 39 hectares of land, and by 1958, it had increased to 60 hectares. In 1958, the wheat yield of the cooperative reached 1,200 kilograms per hectare, which exceeded the average yield of some agricultural and pastoral farms.

In 1958, the "Zhamar" cooperative delivered more than 4,300 young animals. In addition to supplying meat for the members and livestock turned over to the state, the net increase in livestock was 19% higher than in 1957, exceeding the livestock increase plan. Moreover, the livestock are healthy, and the output of animal products has also increased: last year, the average milk yield per cow was 450 liters, and the average wool yield per sheep was 1.37 kilograms, reaching the indicators stipulated in the national three-year plan.

Not long ago, the Mongolian Party and government issued a resolution requiring herdsmen across the country to do a good job in lambing and protecting lambs to ensure increased livestock production in 1959. In response to this call from the Party and government, the entire cooperative has prepared sheds for small livestock, as well as dry manure and feed for the sheds, and disinfection supplies for lambing have also been prepared.

With the development of the cooperative's production, the income of the members has also increased. In this regard, the cooperative's accounting comrade told us several telling figures: in 1957, the cash distributed to members for each working day was 3.5 tugriks (Mongolian currency), 270 grams of meat, and 200 grams of vegetables. By 1958, the cash and in-kind distributed for each working day had become 4 tugriks, 350 grams of meat, and 400 grams of vegetables.

The members' enthusiasm for labor is also constantly improving. If the average working days of the members in 1957 was 120, which has exceeded the number stipulated in the Mongolian Cooperative Model Charter, then the average working days of the members in 1958 reached 145, which greatly exceeds the number stipulated in the Model Charter. As a result of the members' active labor, not only has production increased, but also the members' lives have gradually improved.

Early the next morning, we took a car to visit the winter camp. Along the way, we saw piles of fodder and sheds. A comrade who led us on the tour said that these were all prepared for overwintering and lambing. With food and warm shelter, the basic problems of overwintering have been solved.

After crossing a small slope, we arrived at the winter camp next to Zhamar Mountain. Zhamar Mountain is much higher than the small hills we passed. It is like a screen, blocking the cold wind blowing from all directions. The sheep walk and graze on the mountainside and at the foot of the mountain, seemingly unaware of the cold.

Two cooperative members live here, and they are responsible for grazing more than 600 sheep.

Cooperative member Aver invited us to drink milk tea in his yurt. The iron stove in the yurt was burning, which was very warm. Aver was one of the old members of the cooperative when it was first established in 1954. His family of five, the older child is studying in the cooperative's affiliated primary school, and the two younger children live in the winter camp with their parents.

Aver told us that in the past few years, he has seen livestock continue to increase, and the enthusiasm for production has grown year by year. Cooperatives have more people and greater strength. Every year in the severe cold, there is no need to worry or be afraid. The main thing is to divide the work and do a good job in production. He said that after working every year, he gets vegetables and meat, and life is getting better day by day.

The young cooperative member Davar sat next to us. We asked him how many livestock he had left for himself. He said that he left a few horses for better grazing and management of livestock, and also to avoid the cooperative from allocating horses to him separately. Another cooperative member said that herdsmen like to ride their own horses the most.

When we said goodbye, we saw the hostess bring a lamb from the flock at the foot of Zhamar Mountain. It was just born, and the lamb was very strong. The children were especially happy to see the lamb. The older children went up to meet it and took the lamb into their arms, caressing it so intimately. The flock, facing the sun, left the foot of Zhamar Mountain and went to the nearby pasture to graze.

Back at the cooperative headquarters, we visited some of the cooperative's affiliated institutions.

We walked into the primary school. More than 100 children of the members gathered here to study. The school's classrooms are equipped with heated walls, and classes are held as usual in the severe winter. We saw a class of middle-grade students playing games in the yard, having a lot of fun. The boys and girls were wearing leather robes, most of them with red scarves.

Not far from the school is a large club. This was built by the members themselves this year, and interior installation work is underway. This year, where the cooperative is located, power stations and several dormitories have also been built. Together with the past offices, shops, and school housing, the scale of settlement is getting larger and larger.

The members said that in 1959, they will also build houses, expand the cultivated area, and better complete the livestock increase plan. We are fully confident that this cooperative, which has increased production year after year, will achieve new successes in the new year.

    “扎麻尔”山下

    蒙古农牧业合作化运动，在1958年内飞快发展。它的发展速度和规模都是空前的。这是蒙古人民在1958年取得的重大成就，对进一步发展农牧业生产将有很大作用。
    去年3月，蒙古人民革命党举行第十三次代表大会时，全国入社牧户只占总牧户的35％。第十三次代表大会把进一步发展合作社作为1958—1960年三年计划的重要任务，并且决定三年内要使大部分牧户入社。蒙古党的这一号召，立即得到广大牧民的拥护，农牧业合作化运动，在草原上迅速展开，入社牧户天天增多，根据最近统计，已经达到总牧户的75％。这就是说，在不到一年的时间内，入社牧户增加了一倍多。这是非常迅速的发展。蒙古部长会议第一副主席曾德说过，今年全国将要实现牧业合作化，使三年计划的任务提前完成。
    牧民组织起来以后，在加强牲畜的饲养管理、抗御自然灾害、繁殖牲畜方面，充分显示了优越性，促进了牧业生产的发展。去年，蒙古全国增殖牲畜十万多头，其中，合作社比前年增殖牲畜6％，而个体牧民却减少了3％。这个事实，生动的表明合作化的好处，同时也鼓舞牧民更积极地组织起来。
    这里，让我们从一个合作社的发展，来看蒙古牧区生产兴旺和生活改善的景象。
    一个晴朗的日子，我们乘汽车从乌兰巴托去中央省的“扎麻尔”合作社采访。道路两旁的草地上盖着白雪，不时看到一群群的牛、马和绵羊，在冷风里、在雪地里游荡，它们一面舐雪，一面吃草。汽车翻过几个土丘，到达“扎麻尔”合作社时，已经天晚了。
    我们虽然来得不巧，合作社长因事到南戈壁省去了，可是，社里的干部和社员同志们热情地接待了我们。我们被招待在新盖的招待所里。火墙烧得很暖和，社里的发电站按时送电，屋里大放光明。喝下两碗奶茶，途中寒气尽消。
    就在这个暖和的、明亮的房子里，我们和社员同志们围炉攀谈，他们亲切地向我们介绍了合作社的过去和现在。
    “扎麻尔”这个合作社成立已经四年了。最初，只有十八户牧民，全社只有二千七百多头牲畜。四年来，连年增殖牲畜，连年完成计划，因此许多牧户都相继参加到社里来。由于生产的发展，今年另一个比较小的合作社也并到这个社里来。现在，全社扩大到二百二十四户，牲畜增加到一万九千一百头。
    在几年的生产过程中，社员们已经很好地体会到：要更好地发展畜牧业，就需要和农业结合起来。合作社种植了谷物、饲料作物和蔬菜，不但可以满足社员粮食和蔬菜的需要，同时还增加了人工饲料，为使牲畜安全过冬准备了物质基础。因此，合作社的耕地面积在逐年扩大，1957年全社种植了三十九公顷土地，到1958年，已经增加到六十公顷。1958年社里的小麦产量每公顷达到一千二百公斤，这个数字超过了有些农牧场的平均产量。
    1958年，“扎麻尔”社接产了四千三百多只幼畜，除了供给社员的肉食和上缴国家的牲畜外，比1957年纯增牲畜19％，超额完成增畜计划。而且牲畜健壮，畜产品的产量也增多了：去年全年平均每头牛挤奶四百五十立升，每只羊剪毛一点三七公斤，达到了国家三年计划规定的指标。
    不久以前，蒙古党和政府曾经公布了一个决议，要求全国牧民作好接羔、保羔工作，以保证1959年牲畜增产。为了响应党和政府的这一号召，全社已经准备好小畜的圈棚，以及棚圈内垫的干粪和饲料，接羔时用的消毒用品也已准备齐全。
    随着合作社生产的发展，社员的收入也增多了。关于这一点，社里的会计同志告诉了我们几个很能说明问题的数目字：1957年，社员每个劳动日分得的现金是三点五图格里克（蒙币）、二百七十克肉和二百克蔬菜。到1958年，每个劳动日分得的现金和实物已成为四图格里克、三百五十克肉和四百克蔬菜了。
    社员们的劳动积极性也在不断的提高，如果说1957年社员们一年的平均劳动日为一百二十个，已经超过了蒙古合作社示范章程规定的数字，那么，1958年社员平均作的劳动日达到一百四十五个，更大大超过了示范章程规定的数字。由于社员积极劳动的结果，不仅使生产增加了，同时社员的生活也逐步得到改善。
    第二天一清早，我们便坐上汽车去冬营地参观。一路上，我们看到一堆堆饲草、一个个棚圈。领我们参观的一位同志说，这些都是为过冬、接羔准备的，有吃的，有温暖的住处，过冬的基本问题得到解决了。
    翻过一个小坡，我们便来到扎麻尔山旁的冬营地了。扎麻尔山比我们经过的那些小山丘要高得多，它像一面屏风，挡住了从四野吹来的寒风，羊群在山腰和山脚边散步吃草，似乎感觉不到什么寒冷。
    这里住着两户社员，他们负责放牧六百多只绵羊。
    社员阿维尔请我们到他的蒙古包里喝奶茶。蒙古包里的铁炉子烧着火，很暖和，阿维尔是1954年初建合作社时的老社员之一，一家五口人，大孩子在合作社附设的小学里念书，两个小孩随父母住在冬营地。
    阿维尔告诉我们说，几年来，看到牲畜不断增多，生产的劲头一年比一年大。合作社人多力量大，每年严寒，不用担心害怕，主要的是分工把生产搞好。他说，每年劳动后，又得蔬菜又得肉，日子一天比一天过得好。
    年青的社员达瓦尔坐在我们旁边，我们问他自己有几头自留牲畜。他说，他留下几头马，为了更好的放牧和管好牲畜，也免得合作社还另外给他配马匹。另一位社员说，牧民们最喜爱骑自己的马。
    我们告辞出来，看见女主人从扎麻尔山脚下的羊群里抱来一只小羊羔。这是刚才降生的，羊羔身体很粗壮。孩子们看到小羊羔特别高兴，大些的孩子迎上去，把羊羔接到怀中，那样亲密地爱抚着它。羊群迎着阳光，离开扎麻尔山脚，到附近的草场去游牧去了。
    回到社址，我们参观了合作社的一些附设机构。
    我们走进了小学校。社员的一百多个小孩齐集在这里念书。学校的教室都有暖墙设备，严冬照常上课。我们看到一班中年级学生在院子里作游戏，玩得真欢。男、女孩子们穿着皮袍子，大部系着红领巾。
    距离学校不远，是一个大俱乐部。这是社员们今年自己兴建的，正在进行室内安装工作。今年合作社在社址定居的地方，还兴建了发电站和几幢宿舍，连同过去的办公室、商店和学校的住房，定居的规模越来越大了。
    社员们说，在1959年内，还要兴建房屋，扩大耕地面积，更好地完成增畜计划。我们完全相信，这个连年增产的合作社，在新的一年里，一定会获得新的成就。（附图片）
