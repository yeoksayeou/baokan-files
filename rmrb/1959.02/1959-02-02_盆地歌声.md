Songs of the Qaidam Basin

	Pointing to the sky, stamping feet to crack the earth, a great hand waves,
		The Gobi blooms with fresh flowers.
	-- Street poem in Da Qaidam

	Workers possess the spirit to swallow mountains and seas,
		Thousand-mile eyes penetrate the earth's crust.
	We must make derricks dot the sands,
		Crude oil overflow the Kunlun Mountains.
	-- Street poem in Mang'ai

	Geological hammers shatter mountains,
		Drilling rigs will penetrate the earth.
	Heroes are born with thousand-mile eyes,
		Commanding Kunlun to offer its treasures.
	-- Geological Prospecting Team
