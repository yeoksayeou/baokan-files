Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 12th. In order to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Albania (November 29th this year), the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers, the National Committee of the Democratic Front, and the Central Council of Trade Unions recently jointly issued a resolution on launching a socialist labor competition throughout Albania.

According to this resolution, Albania will establish socialist labor competition committees at the central and local levels to lead the competition, and will formulate mobile red flags and various prizes to reward the winners.

Socialist labor competition has become one of Albania's traditional methods of promoting production. This competition is held annually, and this year it is of even greater significance.

Since New Year's Day this year, some enterprises have put forward competition conditions, and some have even written guarantees to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party. For example, the workers of the Stalin Textile United Factory guaranteed that in 1959 they would produce 240,000 more meters of cotton cloth, 10,000 meters of woolen fabrics, and reduce costs by 20 million leks (Albanian currency) than originally planned.

    用更大的生产成绩迎接解放十五周年
    阿全国开展社会主义劳动竞赛
    党和政府决议建立专门委员会领导竞赛
    新华社地拉那12日电　为了迎接阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年（今年11月29日），阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、部长会议、民主阵线全国委员会和工会中央理事会最近联合发布了关于在全阿开展社会主义劳动竞赛的决议。
    根据这一决议，阿尔巴尼亚中央和地方都将建立社会主义劳动竞赛委员会来领导竞赛并将制定流动红旗和各种奖品，以便奖给优胜者。
    社会主义劳动竞赛已成为阿尔巴尼亚传统的推动生产的方法之一。这种竞赛每年都举行一次，而今年更具有巨大意义。
    从今年元旦起，有的企业已提出竞赛条件，有的并向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央写了保证书。如斯大林纺织联合工厂的工人们保证在1959年将要比原计划多生产二十四万公尺棉布，一万公尺毛织品和降低成本二千万里克（阿币）。
