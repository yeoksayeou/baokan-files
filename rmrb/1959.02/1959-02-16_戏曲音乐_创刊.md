“Opera Music” Launched

Chinese opera is a comprehensive art form, and music is an important component of it. Opera music not only has a long history and fine traditions in opera, but also has a particularly broad mass appeal. Among the more than 360 opera genres in the country, the main differences lie in the music. In the past, although most actors and opera music workers had a lot of experience and achievements, they did not have enough understanding and research on this point, and lacked a more full understanding and grasp of the tradition of opera music and its laws of development. Opera workers have long hoped for a place to conduct exchanges and discussions in this area.

The newly launched "Opera Music" will meet this requirement. It publishes reviews of opera music work, lectures on knowledge and techniques, and introductions and analysis of arias and scores. The inaugural issue includes Comrade Lü Ji’s "A Few Hopes" and Comrade Fei Ke’s "A Little Experience," as well as Comrade Liu Jidian’s "Several Practices in the Musical Design of the Peking Opera ‘White Haired Girl’," which has provided a good start from theory to practice in guiding and exploring opera music creation and the laws of development. Comrade Lü Ji's article pointed out that the development and reform of opera music must be based on the needs of the plot and the real life represented by the characters, and at the same time, it must be gradually enriched and developed in accordance with the unique style of the music of each opera genre and the love of the people. In his article "Eagerness and Expectations," Mr. Mei Lanfang used his own long experience and successful experiments to illustrate that the close cooperation between opera actors, musicians, and music workers is of great benefit to the development of opera arias and the improvement of actors' musical literacy.

### “戏曲音乐”创刊

    “戏曲音乐”创刊
    我国戏曲是一种综合性艺术，音乐是它的一个重要组成部分。戏曲音乐在戏曲中不仅有着悠久的历史和优良的传统，而且有着特别广泛的群众性。全国三百六十多个剧种，它的区别主要也在音乐方面。过去，大多数演员和戏曲音乐工作者虽然有很多经验和成绩；但是对这一点没有足够的认识和钻研，对戏曲音乐传统及其发展规律缺乏更充分的了解和掌握。戏曲工作者早就希望有一块园地来进行这方面的交流和讨论。
    新创刊的“戏曲音乐”，将满足这方面的要求。它刊载戏曲音乐工作的述评，知识技术的讲座和唱腔曲谱的介绍分析。创刊号中刊出了吕骥同志的“几点希望”和费克同志的“一点体会”，以及刘吉典同志的“京剧‘白毛女’音乐设计上的几点做法”，在指导和探索戏曲音乐创作上和发展规律上已经有了一个从理论到实践的很好的开始。吕骥同志的文章指出了戏曲音乐的发展和改革，必须根据剧情和角色所表现的现实生活的需要，同时也必须按照各剧种音乐的特有风格和人民的喜爱，逐步加以丰富和发展。梅兰芳先生在“热望和期待”一文中，以他自己长期的经历和成功的试验，说明戏曲演员、乐师和音乐工作者的密切合作，对于发展戏曲唱腔及提高演员的音乐修养都有很大的好处。
