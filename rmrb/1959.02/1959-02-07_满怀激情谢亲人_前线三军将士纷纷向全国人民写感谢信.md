In the past five months, the officers and soldiers on the front line have received warm care from the people of the whole country. They have successively received condolences from the Fujian Province and the eight provinces and cities of Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as the accompanying 42 art troupes. They have seen the brilliant performances of famous performing artists such as Mei Lanfang, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, and Xiao Bai Yushuang. At the same time, the officers and soldiers have also received more than 870,000 letters and telegrams of condolence and 137 tons of consolation goods from all ethnic groups across the country.

The condolences from the people of the whole country have greatly inspired the soldiers of the three services on the front line. They are vying to repay the people's care with victories in combat and achievements in their work. Once, as soon as a comfort group arrived at a certain air force airport, the pilots received combat orders. They expressed their determination to greet the envoys of the people from the rear with victory, immediately piloting "Divine Eagles" into the clouds. In this battle, the heroes returned with the good news of shooting down three Chiang Kai-shek's F-86 aircraft, meeting with their relatives waiting at the airport.

Recently, officers and soldiers, filled with passion, have written letters of gratitude to the people of the whole country, expressing their determination to defend the motherland and safeguard world peace. One soldier wrote: Soldiers guard the coast on the front line, and loved ones travel thousands of miles to visit. Condolences, care and encouragement, a deep affection warms the heart.
