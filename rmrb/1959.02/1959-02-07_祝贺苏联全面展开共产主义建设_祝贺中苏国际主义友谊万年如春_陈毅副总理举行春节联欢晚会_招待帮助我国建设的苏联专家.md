Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a Spring Festival reception tonight at the Beijing Hotel to entertain Soviet experts who are assisting our country's construction. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, the chief Soviet expert, Fumin, heads of Soviet experts working in various departments, and their wives were invited to attend the reception.

    During the reception, which was filled with joy and brotherly friendship, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, and heads of various departments Wang Shoudao, Lin Feng, Jia Tuofu, Liao Luyan, Liu Xiufeng, Qian Junrui, and others repeatedly raised their glasses with the Soviet comrades, warmly congratulating the great Soviet Union on entering the era of full-scale communist construction, congratulating the great leap forward in China's socialist construction, and congratulating the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

    At the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi first met with the Soviet expert comrades and had cordial talks. He said that the convocation of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a major event in contemporary political life. The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy is a magnificent program for building communism, which greatly strengthens the confidence of the people of the world in the struggle for peace, makes our friends rejoice, and shocks our enemies.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the current international situation is extremely favorable to the people of the world. The strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially the strength and unity of China and the Soviet Union, are the decisive factors in stopping war and defending world peace. Now, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are accelerating the pace of construction. The realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the development of the economic strength of the socialist countries will fundamentally change the face of the world.

    After the meeting and talks, a grand banquet began. At the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, thanked the Soviet experts for their help in China's socialist construction. He said that all the Soviet experts are technical talents with rich scientific knowledge and high political literacy cultivated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's great Seven-Year Construction Plan needs them very much, but the Soviet Party and government sent them to help China's construction. This is a manifestation of a great internationalist spirit, and we express our heartfelt thanks and admiration for this.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that all the Soviet expert comrades who come to China regard China's construction as their own construction and have deep feelings for the Chinese Party and people. They left their happy homeland and families to help China's construction. This is also a manifestation of a great internationalist spirit, and we also express our heartfelt thanks and admiration for this. Vice Premier Chen Yi finally raised his glass to wish for the strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to wish Comrade Khrushchev good health, and to wish all Soviet expert comrades good health.

    Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, then spoke at the banquet, saying that tonight's reception is an even more glorious and joyful evening because the Soviet Union has now entered a new stage of directly building communism. He said that all mankind is paying close attention to the magnificent program for building a communist society in the Soviet Union formulated by the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU. The People's Republic of China and all other fraternal countries and fraternal parties warmly welcome this outstanding event in the life of the Soviet people. He said that the realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy will clearly not only strengthen the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, but also accelerate the development speed of the fraternal countries, thereby providing guarantees for more favorable conditions for world peace.

    Antonov said with brotherly passion: "The Soviet comrades who are working in China are fulfilling their internationalist brotherly obligations and are proud to be able to contribute to China's socialist construction. We believe that it is a glorious thing to be able to work in China, to directly work for the interests of our two great peoples, and to strengthen and develop the unbreakable Soviet-Chinese friendship and cooperation with practical actions." In his speech, Antonov also wished the Chinese people greater achievements in socialist construction in 1959. He finally proposed a toast to the eternal and great Soviet-Chinese friendship and cooperation, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

    Fumin, the chief Soviet expert, said at the banquet that Soviet experts, like all Soviet people, are sincerely happy about the great achievements and heroic struggles of the Chinese people in building first-class industries and realizing high-speed national industrialization. He said that our experts work in various industrial sectors. With their direct labor and the experience of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan, they work with Chinese experts to make their due contributions to the cause of developing the industry and national economy of the People's Republic of China and to consolidating the friendship and brotherly cooperation of the two great nations on earth. Fumin concluded by saying that our people have given us the opportunity to participate with our knowledge and experience in the socialist construction of the country of our dear friends and brothers, and to strengthen the friendly unity between the two great nations. We Soviet experts feel infinitely happy. Soviet experts will spare no effort to honorably fulfill their obligations.

    After the grand banquet, the guests enjoyed music, dance, and acrobatics performances by artists from the capital. The reception concluded with the solemn song "Moscow-Beijing."

    陈毅副总理在联欢会上，首先同苏联专家同志会见并进行了亲切谈话。他说，苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会的召开，是当代政治生活中的一件大事。苏联发展国民经济七年计划是建设共产主义的宏伟纲领，它大大地增强了全世界人民争取和平的斗争信心，使我们的朋友为之欢欣鼓舞，使我们的敌人为之震惊。
    陈毅副总理强调指出，目前国际形势对世界人民极为有利，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大和团结，特别是中苏两国的强大和团结，是制止战争和保卫世界和平的决定因素。现在，苏联、中国和社会主义各国正在加快建设的步伐，苏联七年计划的实现和各社会主义国家经济力量的发展，必将使世界面貌根本上改观。
    在会见和谈话后，开始举行盛大宴会。陈毅副总理在宴会上代表中共中央和国务院感谢苏联专家对我国社会主义建设事业的帮助。他说，所有的苏联专家都是苏联共产党培养出来的具有丰富的科学知识和高度的政治修养的技术人才，苏联的伟大七年建设计划很需要他们，但是苏联党和政府把他们派来帮助中国建设，这是一种伟大的国际主义精神的表现，我们对此表示衷心的感谢和钦佩。
    陈毅副总理说，所有苏联专家同志到中国来，都把中国的建设看成是他们自己的建设，对中国党和人民有着深厚的感情。他们离开了幸福的祖国和家庭，来帮助中国建设，这也是一种伟大的国际主义精神的表现，我们对此同样表示衷心的感谢和钦佩。陈毅副总理最后举杯祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大和团结，祝赫鲁晓夫同志的身体健康，祝所有苏联专家同志的身体健康。
    苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫接着在宴会上讲话说，今天的联欢晚会是一个更加光彩、更加快乐的晚会，因为苏联现在已经进入一个新的直接建设共产主义的阶段。他说，全人类非常注意苏共第二十一次非常代表大会所制定的在苏联建设共产主义社会的宏伟纲领。中华人民共和国和所有其它兄弟国家和兄弟党都极其热烈地欢迎苏联人民生活中的这一卓越的事件，他说，苏联发展国民经济七年计划的实现，显然，不但会加强苏联和整个社会主义阵营的力量，而且还会加快各兄弟国家发展的速度，从而提供保证世界和平的更加有利的条件。
    安东诺夫满怀着兄弟友谊的激情说道：“我们在中国工作的苏联同志履行着自己的国际主义的兄弟义务，能够为中国建设社会主义出一分力量而自豪，能够在中国工作，直接为我们两国伟大人民的利益而从事劳动，以实际行动加强和发展牢不可破的苏中友谊与合作，我们认为这是一件光荣的事情。”安东诺夫在讲话中还祝愿中国人民1959年的社会主义建设获得更大的成就。他最后提议为永久的伟大的苏中友好与合作，为毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
    苏联专家总负责人符明在宴会上讲话说，苏联专家们，同所有的苏联人一样，对中国人民为了建成头等的工业，为了实现高速度的国家工业化所获得的巨大成就和进行的英勇斗争感到由衷的高兴。他说，我们的专家在各个工业部门工作，他们以自己直接的劳动，运用苏联六个五年计划的经验，同中国专家一起，在发展中华人民共和国的工业和国民经济的事业中、在巩固地球上两大民族的友谊和兄弟合作的事业中，做出自己的应有贡献。符明最后说，我国人民给予我们机会，使我们能够以自己的知识和经验来参加我们亲爱的朋友们和兄弟们的国家的社会主义建设，加强两大民族之间的友好团结，我们苏联专家们感到无限的幸福。苏联专家们将不惜一切力量来光荣地履行自己的义务。
    在盛大的宴会以后，宾主在一起欣赏了首都艺术家们表演的音乐、歌舞和杂技节目。联欢晚会最后在庄严的“莫斯科—北京”的歌声中结束。
