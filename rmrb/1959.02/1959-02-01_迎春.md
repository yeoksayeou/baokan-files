　　I. Picking up bits of news for the Spring Festival, reporting to our fellow villagers, the flowers in the South are smiling, while the wind and snow in the North are tight; though the seasons are different, we are of one mind in welcoming the Spring, this year Spring comes early, and the Great Leap Forward is already underway.

　　II. Stepping forward, the morning glow rises in the east, pedestrians clasp hands, competitions are linked one after another, taking steady steps, soaring high and being comprehensive, learning good experiences, surpassing 1958.

　　III. In the countryside, *dong dong qiang*, the sound of gongs and drums echoes everywhere, welcoming the Spring Festival, every household is filled with fragrance; red lanterns illuminate red hearts, the commune is even stronger, the Eight-Point Charter of Agriculture is hung high, cheering for the Communist Party.

　　IV. In the city, firecrackers are set off, from dark to dawn, when will the revelry end? May I ask how long Spring is! Asking Spring, Spring does not know, the Three Marshals have already ascended their platforms, well then, chase the vanguard, chasing all the way to the sun.

　　V. The sun smiles and nods, tightly holding the hand of a new star, constantly asking if the Soviet Union is doing well, praising it for surpassing America, before Spring, the Party held a meeting, wanting to change the new Earth, war will be eradicated, and mankind will celebrate a good harvest.

    迎春
    俯拾一春节捎喜讯，报知咱乡亲，南国花含笑，北地风雪紧；时令虽不同，迎春一条心，今年春来早，跃进已进行。二开步走向前，早霞起东边，行人手相握，竞赛前后连，快步脚放稳，高飞带全面，学来好经验，超过五八年。三农村咚咚锵，锣鼓一片响，迎接春节来，家家满门香；红灯照红心，公社更健强，八字宪法挂，欢呼共产党。四城里放炮仗，从黑到天亮，狂欢几时完？请问春短长！问春春不知，三帅已升帐，好吧追先锋，一追到太阳。五太阳笑点头，紧握新星手，连问苏联好，夸他胜美洲，春前党开会，要换新地球，战争将绝灭，人类庆丰收。
