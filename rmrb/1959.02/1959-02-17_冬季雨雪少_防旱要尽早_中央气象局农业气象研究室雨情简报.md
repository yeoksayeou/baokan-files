Little Winter Rain and Snow: Drought Prevention Should Start Early
Central Meteorological Bureau Agricultural Meteorology Research Office Rainfall Report

Characteristics of Rainfall in the Past Four Months
Since October of last year, rainfall in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and areas south of the Yangtze River has been less than the average for the same period in previous years. From October of last year to January of this year, rainfall in western Northeast China was only 10 to 30 millimeters (mm), and in the east, it was only 30 to 70 mm, both more than half less than the average for the same period. During the same period, rainfall in Guangdong and eastern Guangxi, as well as most of Yunnan, only reached 40 to 80 mm, about one-third of the average for the same period. Rainfall in the vast area south of the Yangtze River and north of the Nanling Mountains was about 90 to 200 mm, still 30% to 50% less than the average for the same period. However, in the past four months, rainfall in areas north of the Yangtze River and south of the Great Wall has been more than the average for previous years. In northern North China, it was about 40 to 90 mm, and in southern North China, southern Shaanxi, and the Huai River basin, it was about 110 to 190 mm, all more than double the average for the same period. There was little snowfall in areas north of the Yangtze River basin in December of last year and January of this year, and there is currently very little snow cover in the north. There is more snow in northern Xinjiang, but the deepest is only about one chi (foot), and the snow is deeper in the Changbai Mountain area of ​​Northeast China, but generally only two to five cun (inches) deep. There is no snow cover in the entire North China region.

Based on the above situation, the high rainfall in the Yellow River and Huai River basins last winter was not only beneficial to the overwintering wheat crops, but also, because the winter temperatures were low, the soil was frozen, and evaporation was minimal, soil moisture changes were very slight, which is very beneficial for spring sowing. However, the current temperature in this area is higher than usual, and thawing has begun, so measures must be taken as early as possible to conserve moisture. The main rain-deficient areas in the country (except for the Northwest) are in South China, Guangdong, and eastern Guangxi, where rainfall has been scarce since last September, and due to the high temperatures and high evaporation, the drought is more severe. This area has now begun spring plowing and will gradually begin spring sowing, so vigorous efforts are needed to combat drought.

Rainfall Distribution and Trends in the Coming Months
In previous years, the regions where droughts frequently occurred in the spring were the areas south of the Nanling Mountains and the Jinsha River basin, and areas north of the Huai River. Comparing the rainfall situation in the past four months, it can be seen that the areas with less rainfall are mostly the areas where spring droughts easily occur in previous years. According to the recent signs of weather changes, it is estimated that the Guangdong and Guangxi regions will still have little rain in February, and the drought is not expected to be alleviated until March or April. From February to May, there will not be much rainfall in Northeast China and North China, and in addition, these areas have high winds and high evaporation in the spring, so moisture conservation and irrigation are issues that must be paid attention to. Rainfall in the Yangtze River basin is currently trending upwards, and it is estimated that spring rainfall (especially in the Jiangnan area) will be relatively high.

Judging from the overall trend this year, there will be less rainfall in North China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and attention must also be paid to the development of summer and autumn droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Summer and autumn rainfall in Northeast and South China may be close to normal. In order to ensure a bumper harvest this year, we should strengthen water conservancy work, store water and fight drought; and in terms of agricultural technology, spring harrowing in the northern regions should be carried out as early as possible. In areas prone to drought, the land should be leveled in a timely manner after plowing, and timely cultivation should be carried out after rain. In this way, soil evaporation can be reduced, and the purpose of moisture conservation can be achieved. For overwintering crops such as rapeseed and winter wheat in the Yangtze River basin, as well as dryland spring-sown crops, attention must be paid to ditching and drainage. This will not only prevent waterlogging but also reduce the spread of pests and diseases.

    冬季雨雪少　防旱要尽早
    中央气象局农业气象研究室雨情简报
    过去四个月降水的特点
    自去年10月以来，东北、内蒙古以及长江以南各地降水都比常年同期为少。从去年10月到今年1月，东北西部降水仅十至三十公厘（毫米），东部也仅三十至七十公厘，均较常年同期少一半以上。在同一时期内，广东和广西东部以及云南大部降水只达四十至八十公厘，约为常年同期的三分之一。长江以南、南岭以北广大地区降水约在九十至二百公厘左右，仍较常年同期少30％至50％。但在过去的四个月内，长江以北到长城以南各地，降水都较常年为多。华北北部约四十至九十公厘，华北南部、陕西南部和淮河流域均在一百一十至一百九十公厘左右，都超出常年同期的一倍左右。去年12月和今年1月长江流域以北各地降雪较少，目前北方有积雪的地区很少。新疆北部积雪较多，但最深也不过一尺左右，东北以长白山附近地区积雪较深，但一般也只有二至五寸深。华北全境没有积雪。
    根据上述情况看来，去冬黄河和淮河流域降水多，不但对越冬作物小麦有利，而且由于冬季气温较低，土壤冻结，蒸发很少，土壤湿度变化甚微，对春播也很有好处。但目前这个地区气温较常年高，已开始解冻，须及早采取保墒措施。全国主要缺雨地区（除西北外）是在华南，广东和广西东部，自去年9月到现在，降水一直稀少，由于该地气温较高，蒸发量大，旱象较重。目前这个地区已开始春耕，并将陆续开始春播，需大力抗旱。
    今后几月降水分布和趋势
    历年春季发生干旱频繁的地区是南岭和金沙江流域以南地区和淮河以北各地。对照过去四个月的降水情况，可以看出，降水量较少的地区大都是历年容易发生春旱的地区。根据最近一段时期天气变化的迹象看来：估计两广地区2月份仍然少雨，旱象要在3月或4月以后才可望解除。2至5月，东北、华北降水将不会多，加之这些地区春天风大，蒸发大，保墒、灌溉是必须注意的问题。长江流域目前降水已趋向增多，估计春季降水（特别是江南地区）是比较多的。
    从今年总的趋势看，华北和长江中、下游地区降水将较少，长江中、下游还须注意夏旱和秋旱的发展。东北和华南地区夏秋降水可能接近常年。为了确保今年的大丰收，应该加强水利工作，蓄水抗旱；而在农业技术上，北方地区的春耙应及早进行。在容易发生干旱的地区，耕地以后要及时把地耙平，雨后及时进行中耕。这样，可以减少土壤蒸发，达到保墒的目的。长江流域的越冬作物如油菜、冬小麦等以及旱地春播作物，须注意开沟排水。这样不但可以防止涝害，而且可以减少病虫害的蔓延。
