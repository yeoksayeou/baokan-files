Socialist Czechoslovakia is Becoming Increasingly Prosperous and Beautiful
By Our Correspondents Lin Hai and Yang Yi

The laboring people of Czechoslovakia bid farewell to the fruitful year of 1958 with joy. This country, possessing a high level of industry and science, stands as the western outpost of the socialist camp, displaying the infinitely wonderful youthfulness of the socialist system with its abundant vitality. 1958 was indeed an extraordinary year for Czechoslovakia. It completed the year's journey with a more vigorous pace than in previous years, its industrial growth rate being the highest in six years, with many important industrial products already greatly exceeding those of some major capitalist countries. As President Novotny said in his New Year's address for 1959, "In the history of the Czechoslovak Republic to date, no year has seen the industrial production plan completed as well as it was last year." Agriculture has also advanced a major step in the direction of collectivization, with socialist components already accounting for 76% of all agricultural land. The superiority of large-scale socialist production has been demonstrated by the growth in agricultural production, particularly the good results of agricultural product procurement. In 1958, we also witnessed the flourishing of Czechoslovak socialist culture, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the enormous growth in the political enthusiasm of the laboring people. All of this shows that Czechoslovakia is becoming more and more prosperous and beautiful day by day, forming a sharp contrast to the bleak situation in capitalist countries in 1958.

Comprehensive Leap Forward in the Industrial Sector

The characteristic of Czechoslovakia's national economic achievements in 1958 was the comprehensive and balanced completion of the plan by the industrial sector. Not only were the output value, variety, and sales plans all completed, but the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing costs were also overfulfilled, the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods maintained normal proportions, and in particular, the imbalance between the growth of labor productivity and the growth of average wages since 1953 was reversed. The fact that labor productivity, originally planned to increase by 4%, actually rose by 7.6% is an achievement of great significance.

Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country, and its industry has developed more rapidly since liberation. Czechoslovakia's heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry, has become a solid foundation for the entire national economy. The per capita coal production ranks third in the world, and steel production has already exceeded that of France and Sweden. In terms of machine tool production, Czechoslovakia has reached the level of the most developed countries in the West, and the production of steam turbines and hydraulic turbines has surpassed Western countries. Those who have visited the Gotwald Iron and Steel Works in Ostrava, the steel capital of Czechoslovakia, will not forget the huge 12,000-ton hydraulic press. There are currently only three such large hydraulic presses in Europe, one in the German Democratic Republic, one in West Germany, and one in Czechoslovakia.

Despite this, the development speed of some industrial sectors could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing national economy, especially in sectors such as fuel, power, construction, and transportation. Starting in 1958, the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CCP) focused on studying the uneven development of the national economy, grasped the weak links, and thus broke through the situation that had not been reversed for a long time in the past, fundamentally improved and turned around the previously backward sectors, and brought the development of the national economy to a higher level. For example, the coal industry broke through the situation where it often failed to complete its plans in the past, and many coal mines experienced the gratifying phenomenon of completing production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target for the first time in many years, and were thus able to basically meet the needs of the national economy. The work of the railway transportation sector, which is Czechoslovakia's main mode of transportation, also improved significantly last year, with significant increases in both freight and passenger traffic. Currently, Czechoslovakia's railway freight volume has reached the sum of the freight volumes of six countries: Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland, while the total area and population of these countries are nine times and six times that of Czechoslovakia, respectively. Czechoslovakia's railway passenger volume not only exceeds that of France and Italy, but also surpasses that of the United States, although the US railway network is much longer than that of Czechoslovakia. Improvements in transportation have effectively ensured the exchange of goods and the supply of materials. In addition, the completion of basic construction projects was the best in recent years.

The attainment of all these achievements is the result of the CCP's vigorous strengthening of leadership over the national economy last year. The CCP Central Committee and organizations at all levels personally took the initiative to understand and solve various problems in production, and paid great attention to the weak links in the national economy. For example, in the coal mining industry, the masses were widely mobilized and the level of mechanization in coal production was improved, so that even in the summer of 1958, when workers took the most vacations, the coal production tasks were still overfulfilled. At the same time, the political enthusiasm of the laboring people greatly increased, and socialist labor competitions in various production sectors were more widely carried out. Since the proposal to establish "Socialist Labor Teams" was put forward, workers have demanded to work, study, and live in a socialist way, giving the competition a deeper and more comprehensive content. In addition, the implementation of industrial management restructuring has promoted the enthusiasm of enterprises and localities and stimulated the labor enthusiasm and sense of ownership of employees. Many factories have established systems such as production meetings and technical and economic meetings to promote enterprise democracy. Through these meetings, employees have put forward many useful suggestions for improving production and technology.

Socialist Agriculture Advances Steadily

The 11th Congress of the CCP regarded the realization of the socialist transformation of the countryside as an important symbol of completing the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia. Important progress was made in this regard in 1958. By the end of the year, the number of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives in Czechoslovakia had increased to 12,140, with more than 850,000 members and 4.6 million hectares of farmland. Together with the 1 million hectares of farmland operated by state farms, the socialist component in Czechoslovakia's agriculture accounted for more than three-quarters of the country's farmland. The characteristic of Czechoslovakia's agricultural collectivization movement last year was: on the one hand, 1,050 new agricultural cooperatives were established, and on the other hand, and more importantly, the original cooperatives were consolidated and expanded. Most middle and small farmers joined the cooperatives with their land. Currently, only 1.8 million hectares of farmland are still cultivated by individual farmers.

The progress of agricultural collectivization, the strengthening of the Party's leadership and influence over rural work, has also brought about fruitful results in agricultural production. Agricultural production in 1958 increased by about 3% compared to the previous year, and in particular, the socialist component showed its enormous superiority over the individual economy. Last year, the average grain production per hectare in agricultural cooperatives was about 400 jin more than that of individual farmers.

The procurement of agricultural products in 1958 achieved good results. For example, the grain procurement plan was not only completed earlier than in previous years, but also procured 400,000 tons more than in 1956, which had the best harvest. The purchase volume of sugar beets was also the highest in more than 30 years. These achievements should be mainly attributed to state farms and cooperatives, which provided the state with large quantities of marketable grain quickly and in large quantities. In 1958, state farms delivered 25% more grain than in the previous year, and Unified Agricultural Cooperatives sold almost twice as much grain to the state as in the previous year.

Victory is in Sight in the New Year

The increase in the enthusiasm of the working masses in 1958 is not only manifested in the bumper harvest of the national economy last year, but also created favorable prerequisites for greater victories in 1959. In the second half of last year, workers widely launched discussions on the 1959 production plan, which was carried out in conjunction with the national economic effect census campaign and the signing of collective contracts in factories and enterprises. In the discussions, employees repeatedly increased the original production tasks set in the Second Five-Year Plan. Under the initiative of the masses, this year's production plan has been increased by 5.4 billion crowns compared to the original planned output value, and the production tasks of many of the most important industrial sectors have been increased significantly. For example, electricity has increased by 15.4% and general machine manufacturing has increased by 15.9%. The compilation of the 1959 national economic plan adopted a bottom-up, mass-discussion approach, so that it could maximize the tapping of potential and the implementation of savings. This year, industrial production will increase by another 9.5% on the basis of last year's achievements. The fact that the production plan was successfully completed in January of this year shows that the laboring people of Czechoslovakia will certainly achieve this indicator.

Czechoslovakia's agricultural collectivization movement will be basically completed in the next two years. Currently, more than 6,000 agricultural cooperatives and most state farms have put forward socialist guarantees to complete the huge task of increasing agricultural production by 29% stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In the high-spirited fighting spirit of the broad masses of agricultural workers and cooperative members, the CCP and the government stipulated that agricultural production should increase by 9% this year, and took a series of measures to consolidate the cooperative economy, tap agricultural production potential, and require that the yield per unit area catch up with the most advanced countries.

The above situation shows that 1959 will be a year in which Czechoslovakia continues to move forward by leaps and bounds in accordance with the guidelines and tasks formulated by the 11th Congress of the CCP. The CCP has proposed to concentrate its efforts on grasping production, grasping ideology, and grasping life, and will further improve people's lives by reforming the wage system, increasing subsidies for families with many children, and lowering prices. At the same time, it is also necessary to further strengthen Marxist-Leninist education and influence.

1959 is the fourth year of Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan and a year of decisive significance in the process of completing socialist construction in Czechoslovakia. After satisfactorily summarizing the fruitful results of 1958, the laboring people of Czechoslovakia, under the strong leadership of the CCP, are marching triumphantly towards a more glorious destination, pursuing and fighting bravely.

    社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克日益繁荣美好
    本报记者　林海　杨翊
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民满怀喜悦地送走了富有成就的1958年。这个具有高度工业和科学水平的国家，屹立在社会主义阵营的西方前哨，正以充沛的生命力显示出社会主义制度无限美妙的青春。 1958年对捷克斯洛伐克来说的确是不平常的一年。它以比往年更矫健的步伐走完了这一年的路程，它的工业增长速度是六年来最高的，许多重要工业产品已经大大超过了一些主要的资本主义国家。正如诺沃提尼总统在1959年新年致词中所说的，“在捷克斯洛伐克共和国迄今的历史中，还没有那一年的工业生产计划完成的像去年这样好。”农业也朝着集体化的方向前进了一大步，社会主义成份已占全部农地的76％。从农业生产的增长，特别是农产品收购的良好成果中，已显示出社会主义大生产的优越性。在1958年中，我们还看到了捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化的繁荣，人民生活水平的不断提高和劳动人民政治积极性的巨大增长。这一切都表明了捷克斯洛伐克一天天更加繁荣美好，它同1958年资本主义国家的惨淡景象恰好形成了一幅鲜明的对照。
    工业部门的全面跃进
    1958年捷克斯洛伐克国民经济所取得的成就的特点，是工业部门全面地、均衡地完成了计划。不仅产值、品种和销售计划等全部完成，而且超额完成了提高劳动生产率和降低成本的任务，生产资料的生产和消费资料的生产保持了正常的比例，特别是扭转了从1953年以来的劳动生产率与平均工资的增长不平衡的情况。劳动生产率原定增长4％，而实际上升了7.6％，更是一项具有重大意义的成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业高度发达的国家，解放后它的工业获得了更为迅速的发展。捷克斯洛伐克重工业特别是机器制造业已经成为整个国民经济稳固的基础。按人口平均计算，煤产量占世界第三位，钢的生产已经超过了法国和瑞典。在机床生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克已达到了西方最发达的国家的水准，而蒸汽透平机和水力透平机的生产，已经赶过了西方国家。访问过捷克斯洛伐克钢都奥斯特洛伐的哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂的人，是不会忘记那巨大的一万二千吨水压机的。这样的大型水压机在欧洲目前还只有三个，一个在德意志民主共和国，一个在西德，还有一个就在捷克斯洛伐克。
    尽管如此，还有一些工业部门的发展速度不能适应国民经济迅速增长的需要。特别是燃料、动力、建筑和运输等部门。1958年从年初开始，捷共就着重研究了国民经济发展不均衡的现象，抓住了薄弱的环节，从而突破了过去长期没有能扭转的局面，使过去落后的部门取得了根本性的改善和好转，使国民经济的发展达到了更高的水平。例如，煤炭工业突破了过去经常不能完成计划的情况，许多煤矿出现了多年来第一次提前超额完成生产任务的可喜现象，因而已能基本上满足国民经济的需要。作为捷克斯洛伐克主要交通工具的铁道运输部门的工作，去年也显著改观，货运量和客运量都大大增加。目前捷克斯洛伐克铁路货运量已经达到意大利、荷兰、丹麦、挪威、芬兰和瑞士六个国家货运量的总和，而这些国家的总面积和人口分别是捷克斯洛伐克的九倍和六倍。捷克斯洛伐克的铁路客运量不仅超过了法国和意大利，而且也赶过了美国，虽然美国的铁路网比捷克斯洛伐克要长得多。交通运输方面的改进，已有效地保证了货物的交流和材料的供应。此外，基本建设计划的完成情况也是最近几年中最好的。
    所有这些成就的取得，是捷共去年大力加强了对国民经济领导的结果。捷共中央和各级组织都亲自动手了解和解决生产中的各种问题，特别是对国民经济中的薄弱环节给予了极大的重视。比如在煤矿工业中广泛地发动了群众，提高了煤矿生产中的机械化程度，因此1958年甚至在工人们休假最多的夏季，煤炭生产的任务仍然超额完成。同时劳动人民的政治积极性大大增长，各个生产部门的社会主义劳动竞赛获得了更为广泛的开展。自从提出成立“社会主义劳动队”的倡议以来，工人们要求以社会主义的方式工作、学习和生活，使竞赛有了更深刻更全面的内容。加之工业管理改组的实行，发扬了企业和地方的积极性，激发了职工的劳动热情和主人翁感。许多工厂建立了生产会议、技术经济会议等发扬企业民主的制度。职工们通过这些会议对生产的提高和技术的改进，提出了许多有益的建议。
  社会主义农业稳步前进
    捷共第十一次代表大会把实现农村社会主义改造作为完成捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的一项重要标志。1958年中这方面取得了重要进展。到年底时，捷克斯洛伐克的统一农业合作社已增至一万二千一百四十个，共拥有八十五万多个社员和四百六十万公顷农地，加上国营农场经营的一百万公顷农地在内，捷克斯洛伐克农业中的社会主义成分已占全国农地的四分之三以上。去年捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动的特点是：一方面新建了一千零五十个农业合作社，另一方面也是更重要的一方面，是原有的合作社得到了巩固和扩大。大部分中农和小农都带着他们的土地入了社。目前只剩下一百八十万公顷农地还属个体农民耕种。
    农业集体化的进展，党对农村工作领导和影响的增强，也带来了农业生产上的丰硕果实。1958年的农业生产又比前一年提高了约3％，特别是社会主义成分显出了它对个体经济的巨大优越性。去年农业合作社的粮食生产，平均每公顷要比个体农民多约四百斤。
    1958年的农产品收购工作获得良好成绩。例如谷物收购计划不仅完成得比往年都早，而且较收成最好的1956年还多收购了四十万吨。甜菜的采购量也是三十多年来最高的一年。这些成就的取得应主要归功于国营农场和合作社，它们又多又快地为国家提供了大批商品粮，国营农场在1958年上缴的谷物比前一年多25％，统一农业合作社去年向国家缴售的谷物更几乎比前年增加一倍。
    新的一年胜利在望
    1958年工人群众劳动积极性的增长，不仅表现在去年国民经济上的丰收，而且也为1959年更大的胜利创造了有利的前提。去年下半年，工人们广泛展开了对1959年生产计划的讨论，这是和国民经济效果普查运动以及在工厂企业中签订集体合同结合进行的。职工们在讨论中一再提高了第二个五年计划中原定的生产任务。今年的生产计划在群众的主动倡议下已比原来规定的产值提高了五十四亿克朗，许多最重要的工业部门的生产任务都提高很多。如电力增加了15.4％，一般机器制造增加了15.9％。1959年国民经济计划的编制采取了自下而上、群众讨论的方式，因而能最大限度地挖掘潜力和实行节约。今年工业生产将在去年成就的基础上再提高9.5％。从今年1月份顺利完成生产计划的事实中可以看出，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民定会实现这一指标。
    捷农业合作化运动将在今后两年内基本完成。目前已有六千多个农业合作社和大部分国营农场提出了社会主义保证，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划所规定的农业增产29％的巨大任务。在广大农业工人和合作社员的昂扬斗志中，捷共与政府规定了今年农业生产要增长9％，并采取一系列措施巩固合作社经济，发掘农业生产潜力，要求在单位面积产量方面赶上最先进的国家。
    上述情况表明，1959年将是捷克斯洛伐克按照捷共十一大所制定的方针任务继续大步前进的一年。捷共提出要集中力量抓生产、抓思想、抓生活，并将通过改革工资制度，提高多子女家庭补助金和降低物价等，来进一步改善人民生活。同时也要进一步加强马克思列宁主义的教育和影响。
    1959年是捷克斯洛伐克第二个五年计划的第四年，是在捷完成社会主义建设进程中具有决定意义的一年。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民满意地总结了1958年的丰硕成果后，正在捷共坚强的领导下豪迈地朝向更加光辉的目的地乘胜追击，奋勇前进。
