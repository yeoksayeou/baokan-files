Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to the Soviet "Pravda" report: Comrade James Jackson, member of the National Committee Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, who attended the 21st Congress of the CPSU, delivered a speech at the morning meeting on February 2. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrades! I am entrusted by our National Executive Committee to extend our heartfelt congratulations to you on behalf of our delegation and on behalf of the Communist Party of the United States. (Applause)

    If President Eisenhower could also truly say what Comrade Khrushchev said here, that there are no cases of court trials for political crimes in the country, then some of our comrades could also come here to congratulate your Extraordinary Congress, these comrades are: Eugene Dennis, National Secretary in charge of National Affairs of the National Committee, Honorary Chairman Comrade William Foster, Comrades Thompson, Flynn, Davis, Stacher, Lumer, and Boudash. Our dear Comrades Henry Winston and Gil Green are still suffering in prison, otherwise they would be here to congratulate you. (Applause)

    Comrade Khrushchev's bold, magnificent, clear and realistic draft report on the seven-year plan already has the significance of a historical document. This document has won the unanimous support of the entire Soviet people, and the entire Soviet people are taking on the responsibility of completing this inspiring plan, which proves the further comprehensive development of the country and the further rapid improvement of the material and cultural level of the Soviet people. The victorious implementation of the control figures of this great plan for construction, production, and cultural progress will create a huge leap forward, raising the Soviet Union to a height unattainable by capitalism in all aspects, and leading the Soviet Union to communism. (Applause)

    Communists all over the world welcome Comrade Khrushchev's ideological contributions and profound foresight in his report on solving a series of issues in the struggle for peace, democracy, national freedom, and socialism. Comrade Khrushchev, on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee and the entire Soviet people, declared to the world: "For our part, we will do everything possible to guarantee peace in the world." The Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on all fraternal Communist Parties to vigorously defend and strengthen peace. The Communist Party of the United States has received great encouragement and strong spiritual support from this call. Comrades, please believe that we will selflessly fight to prevent a small group of monopoly capitalists—merchants of death—from pushing our country into war, because the only result of such a war is the destruction of our nation. (Applause)

    Our country has suffered great humiliation due to the interference of imperialist blocs in the internal affairs of other countries—Latin America, the Middle East, Hungary, and other countries. Millions of our people are increasingly actively fighting to clear these shameful stains on our country's honor and to formulate new diplomatic policies: replacing the brinkmanship policy with a peaceful policy, replacing economic blackmail with equal trade, and replacing hostility towards socialist countries with friendly and peaceful coexistence.

    I know that fraternal parties in various countries are filled with cordial concern for the situation of the Communist Party of the United States. Comrades, I can declare that our party exists! (Applause) It exists among the masses and participates in their daily struggle for work, freedom, and peace. The prospect of expanding the party's influence and increasing the number of party members is achievable.

    Despite the cruel persecution of the reactionaries, our party has persevered. The party has cut off the revisionist ulcer in its leadership and stopped the bleeding. Now, our party has broken free from the shackles of the revisionists, and our leading committee is resolutely fighting against sectarianism and dogmatism. We are building our party based on unwavering Marxist-Leninist principles. (Applause)

    Comrades, please allow me, on behalf of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, to read the congratulatory letter to the 21st Congress:

    "The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a historical event of great significance to the people of all countries.

    Before the convening of the congress, socialism achieved new achievements in all fields of science and technology, especially in the cause of conquering the universe, and achieved new great results—the launching of the lunar rocket. These new achievements opened a glorious prelude to the congress. The world-historically significant event of the lunar rocket's launch into space has been greatly praised and admired by the American people and the people of all countries.

    The new seven-year plan to be discussed at the congress is of epoch-making significance. This plan will not only advance the cause of socialist construction in the Soviet Union by a big step, but it will also have a major impact on the people of all countries in the world, and will once again show the great potential of socialist society.

    This plan is a vivid example for American workers who are facing frequent general unemployment and economic instability. It shows that socialist society can guarantee full employment, improve living standards, and enable everyone to live a guaranteed and continuously improving life.

    The new plan is of special significance to black people who are fighting to get rid of the shackles of discrimination and oppression and to strive for the kind of equal rights, equality, and freedom enjoyed by all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union who jointly participate in the construction of communism.

    According to the new plan, trade will be greatly expanded. Millions of Americans are very concerned about the prospect of developing trade with the Soviet Union and with other socialist countries, because they believe that the development of trade is a potential source for expanding production and employment.

    The entire American people are increasingly aware of the special significance of the seven-year plan for guaranteeing peace and peaceful coexistence. The American people's desire for peace was once again manifested in the general election last November, when voters demanded an end to the brinkmanship policy and advocated that the people of all countries live together peacefully.

    Due to the Soviet Union's peace initiatives and the Soviet Union's help and support for the anti-colonial struggles of the people of all countries, the desire for friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union and for peace talks has become even higher; at the same time, this desire is even stronger due to the increasing frequency of mutual visits by cultural, scientific, political, and other delegations. The fruitful trip to our country by Anastas Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, is of great significance.

    On the occasion of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the United States extends warm brotherly greetings to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which boldly uses and develops the principles of Marxism-Leninism and guides the Soviet people to further promote social progress. (Applause)

    May the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States continue to develop! (Applause) May our two countries advance together in close cooperation and peaceful competition!

    For the noble cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, may the unity of the working people of the world and the fraternal mutual relations of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of the world continue to develop and consolidate!

                    National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States:
                    National Secretary Eugene Dennis
                  Executive Secretary Robert Thompson" (Applause)

    Long live the friendship between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union! (Applause)
    Long live peace! (Applause)
    Long live communism! (Stormy, lasting applause, all standing) (Attached picture)

    美国共产党执行委员会委员
    杰克逊在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的美国共产党全国委员会执行委员会委员詹姆斯·杰克逊同志在2日上午会议上致词，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！我受我们全国执行委员会的委托，代表我们代表团，代表美国共产党向你们致以衷心的祝贺。（掌声）
    如果艾森豪威尔总统也能真正说出赫鲁晓夫同志在这里所说的话，即在国内没有因政治罪行而受到法庭审判的事例，那末我们的某些同志也能到这里来祝贺你们的非常代表大会了，这些同志是：全国委员会负责全国事务书记尤金·丹尼斯，名誉主席威廉·福斯特同志，汤普森，弗林，戴维斯，史塔彻，拉默，鲍达希等同志。我们亲爱的亨利·温斯顿和吉·格林同志还在监狱里受折磨，不然他们也能在这里向你们祝贺。（掌声）
    赫鲁晓夫同志所作的大胆豪迈、明确而现实的七年计划报告提纲，已经具有了历史文件的意义。这个文件获得了全体苏联人民的一致拥护，全体苏联人民都担当起完成这个鼓舞人心的计划的责任，这个计划证明了国家的进一步全面发展，苏联人民的物质和文化水平的进一步迅速提高。胜利地执行这个建设、生产和文化进步的伟大计划的控制数字，就将造成巨大的跃进，使苏联在各个方面上升到资本主义望尘莫及的高度，并使苏联走向共产主义。（掌声）
    全世界共产主义者都欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中对解决争取和平、民主、民族自由和社会主义方面一系列问题提出的思想贡献和深刻预见。赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏共中央和全体苏联人民向全世界宣布：“从我们这方面来讲，我们将尽一切可能来保障全世界的和平。”苏联共产党号召各兄弟共产党大力维护和加强和平。美国共产党从这个号召当中得到了巨大的鼓舞和强有力的精神上的支持。同志们，请你们相信，我们将忘我地进行斗争，不让一小撮垄断资本家——死亡贩子把我国推到战争中去，因为这种战争的唯一结果就是我们民族的毁灭。（掌声）
    由于帝国主义集团干涉他国——拉丁美洲、中东、匈牙利及其他国家——的内政，我国蒙受了莫大的耻辱。我国的千百万人民群众正在日益积极地进行斗争，争取洗清我国荣誉上的这些可耻的污点，制定新的外交政策方针：用和平政策代替战争边缘政策，用平等贸易代替经济讹诈，用友好和和平共处的相互关系代替对社会主义国家的敌视。
    我知道，各国兄弟党对于美国共产党的状况充满了亲切的关怀。同志们，我可以声明，我们的党存在着！（鼓掌）它存在于群众当中，而且参加了他们要工作、要自由、要和平的日常斗争。党的影响的扩大和党员人数的增加的远景是可以实现的。
    尽管反动集团进行了残酷的迫害，我们的党还是坚持下来了。党割掉了领导上的修正主义的溃疡，止住了流血。现在，我们的党已经挣脱了修正主义者的箝制，我们的领导委员会正在坚决地同宗派主义和教条主义进行斗争。我们正在根据坚定不移的马克思列宁主义原则建设我们的党。（掌声）
    同志们，请允许我代表美国共产党全国委员会宣读致第二十一次代表大会的贺信：
    “苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，是对于世界各国人民具有重大意义的历史事件。
    在代表大会召开以前，社会主义在科学技术的一切领域都取得了新的成就，特别明显的是在征服宇宙的事业上获得了新的伟大成果——发射了月球火箭。这些新的成就，为代表大会揭开了光辉灿烂的序幕。月球火箭上天这一具有全世界历史意义的事件，受到了美国人民以及世界各国人民极大的赞美和敬仰。
    代表大会即将讨论的新的七年计划，具有划时代的意义。这个计划不仅使苏联共产主义建设事业前进一大步，而且对于世界各国人民也将有重大的影响，并将再一次地显示出社会主义社会的巨大潜力。
    这个计划对于面临着经常遭到普遍失业和经济不稳定的美国工人来说是一个生动的事例，它表明了社会主义社会能够保证全部就业，提高生活水平，并使每个人过着有保证的和不断得到提高的生活。
    新的计划对为摆脱歧视和压迫的枷锁、为争取像共同参加共产主义建设的苏联各族人民所享有的那种平权、平等和自由而斗争的黑人来说，具有特殊的意义。
    根据新的计划，将大大扩大贸易，千百万美国人非常关心同苏联以及同其他社会主义国家发展贸易的前途，因为他们认为发展贸易是扩大生产和就业的潜在源泉。
    全体美国人民越来越了解七年计划对保证和平和和平共处的特别意义。美国人民要求和平的心情在去年11月大选时再一次表现出来，当时选民们要求结束战争边缘政策，主张各国人民和平地相处。
    由于苏联的和平倡议以及苏联对各国人民反殖民主义斗争的帮助和支持，要求美苏两国友好和举行和平谈判的愿望更加高涨了；同时还由于文化、科学、政治和其他的代表团的相互访问的日益频繁，这种愿望更加强烈了。苏联部长会议第一副主席阿纳斯塔斯·米高扬到我国卓有成效的旅行具有重大意义。
    值此苏联共产党举行第二十一次代表大会之际，美国共产党向大胆地运用和发展马克思列宁主义原则，引导苏联人民进一步推动社会前进的伟大的苏联共产党致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。（掌声）
    愿苏美两国人民的友谊不断发展！（掌声）愿我们两国在紧密合作和和平竞赛当中共同前进！
    为了崇高的和平、民主和社会主义的事业，祝全世界劳动人民的团结和全世界共产党、工人党兄弟般的相互关系不断发展和巩固！
                    美国共产党全国委员会：
                    全国书记尤金·丹尼斯
                  执行书记罗伯特·汤普森”（掌声）
    美苏两国人民的友谊万岁！（掌声）
    和平万岁！（掌声）
    共产主义万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立）（附图片）
