Spring is Good (Lyrics)
	Snowflakes flutter north and south of the Great Wall,
	Spring rain sprinkles across the north and south of the Yangtze River,
	Red plum blossoms on the Five Ridges surge like red waves,
	Waves roll on Hainan Island.

	Waves roll towards the Five Finger Mountain,
	Laughter rings out, songs soar high;
	Waves turn all of China green,
	Everywhere are good seedlings!

	Good seedlings need fertilizer,
	The dragon dances, people surge like the tide,
	Cart wheels and carrying poles provide accompaniment,
	Singing together a song of "Spring is Good!"

	Spring is Good, Spring is Wonderful,
	The spring breeze dances with a smile,
	Raise the hoe, straighten the back,
	Enthusiasm burns like a raging fire!

	Spring is Good, Spring is Wonderful,
	I race against Spring,
	Picking golden flowers from the money tree,
	Digging treasures from the cornucopia.

	Spring is Good, Spring is Wonderful,
	Swallows are reporting the news of spring:
	This year's all-round Great Leap Forward,
	Heroic models take on the challenge!

    春光好（歌词）长城内外雪花飘，大江南北春雨浇，五岭红梅翻红浪，海南岛上卷波涛。波涛卷向五指山，笑声朗朗歌声高；波涛绿遍全中国，处处都是好秧苗！好秧苗，要肥料，长龙飞舞人如潮，车轮扁担作伴奏，合唱一曲春光好！春光好，春光妙，春风含笑在舞蹈，举起锄头挺起腰，干劲好像猛火烧！春光好，春光妙，我和春天来赛跑，摇钱树上摘金花，聚宝盆里挖财宝。春光好，春光妙，燕子在把春讯报：今年全面大跃进，英雄模范把战挑！
