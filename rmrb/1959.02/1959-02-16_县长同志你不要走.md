    County Chief, Don't Go!
    Chen Ruheng Poem, Li Hua Painting
    Seizing the county chief's hand, County Chief, don't go!
    You plow the fields and transplant rice, covered in mud and sweat,
    The paddy fields are harrowed as smooth as a mirror,
    The rice seedlings are planted straight and neat.
    Busy all day in the mud and water,
    Without smoking a single pipe, without drinking a mouthful of tea.
    We don't want to let you go!
    Girls, quickly boil water,
    Young men, quickly pour the wine,
    Quickly close the door,
    Block the main road,
    Seizing the county chief's hand, County Chief, don't go! (Attached picture)

    县长同志你不要走
    陈如恒诗　　李桦画一把拉住县长的手，县长同志你不要走！你又耕田又插秧，浑身泥泞汗水流，水田耙得平如镜，秧苗栽得直溜溜。泥里水里忙一天，烟没抽一筒，茶没喝一口。我们不要放你走！姑娘们，快烧水，小伙子，快打酒，快把门儿关，堵住大路口，一把拉住县长的手，县长同志你不要走！（附图片）
