Introduction to Capstan Power Machine
Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture Working Group

The capstan power machine in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, has a simple structure and can use human, horse, cattle, mule, donkey, and water power, and is not restricted by location. It can be used as a prime mover for all small agricultural machines. It can also drive generators and blowers, and can change the transmission force according to the speed requirements of the operating machine, and increase or decrease labor and animal power according to the size of the transmission force, so as to fully exert mechanical efficiency. Without the shifting part, it can also be used for rope traction. The structure of this power machine is divided into two parts: a power part and a transmission part.

The power part is a large wooden disc with a support. The components of this part are:

I. Bearing Bracket: The function of the bearing bracket is to keep the shaft of the winch from shaking during operation. There is a bracket above the main shaft of the winch (the lower part is buried in the ground), and its height and length should not affect the work of the livestock. The winch is placed in a shallow pit dug in advance, and the transmission belt is led out from the ditch. Wooden boards are placed on the ditch to facilitate the movement of livestock.

II. Capstan: This part is composed of a winch, vertical shaft, horse-drawn lever, and winch base cross. The vertical shaft is a cylinder fixed at the center of the winch. The lower end passes through the winch and rests in the bowl-shaped groove of the base, and the upper end passes through the horizontal plate hole of the bracket. Both the upper and lower ends can rotate. It is made of hardwood. The length of the horse-drawn lever fixed on the vertical shaft should be appropriately determined according to the speed and power required by the machine to be driven. If the required power is large and the speed is low, it can be lengthened; conversely, it can be shortened.

III. Winch: When the horse pulls the horse-drawn lever, the winch starts to rotate, which in turn drives the transmission belt and the transmission wheel. The transmission wheel causes the operating machine to rotate as well. The winch can be large or small. The Anjia People's Commune uses three diameters: 1.8 meters, 2.6 meters, and 3.2 meters. The thickness of the winch is 30 cm (wider than the transmission belt). During manufacturing, two square wooden pillars with the same length as the winch diameter are used to form a cross, and then eight thin wooden supports are used to form a disc support. Then make another disc support of the same size. The two supports are overlapped, and the upper, lower, and surrounding areas are nailed with 3 cm thick boards. The bottom of the disc has a flange to prevent the transmission belt from slipping off.

The transmission part includes: transmission belt, driving wheel, driven wheel (collectively referred to as transmission wheel), transmission shaft, and bearing. The function of this part is to transmit power and change speed.

The formula for calculating how much rotation speed can be obtained by driving a driven wheel with a driving wheel of what size (referring to the driving wheel of the previous stage, not the driving wheel of the coaxial lever, the winch is also considered a driving wheel) is as follows:

Driven wheel speed = Driving wheel diameter × Driving wheel speed ÷ Driven wheel diameter

If the number of revolutions is not enough, another stage of transmission shifting device can be added. Generally speaking, the lower the number of revolutions required by the operating machine, the fewer the number of transmission stages; conversely, the more the number of transmission stages.

If the number of revolutions is not enough, the ratio of the driving wheel to the driven wheel can also be increased. In the third-stage shifting device of the Anjia People's Commune, the ratio of the driving wheel to the driven wheel (next stage) is nineteen to one, which greatly exceeds the book theory that it should not exceed eight to one. However, this ratio cannot be increased indefinitely.

The following is a list of data on the Anjia People's Commune capstan power machine driving several operating machines: (Attached table) Note: △ indicates that this equipment is not required * Anjia People's Commune uses a 400-watt generator

    绞关动力机介绍
    黑龙江省农业厅工作组
    黑龙江五常县的绞关动力机，结构简单，人、马、牛、骡、驴、水等都可做动力，也不受地点条件限制，能做农村一切小型作业机的原动机。它还能带发电机、鼓风机，可以根据作业机转速的需要变换传动力，按照传动力的大小增减劳畜力，充分发挥机械效率。去掉变速部分，又可用于绳索牵引。这种动力机的结构分成两部分：一是动力部分，一是传动部分。
    动力部分是一个带支架的大木盘。这部分的部件有：
    一、轴承支架：轴承支架的作用，是保持绞盘的轴在工作时不摇动。在绞盘的主轴上方有一支架（下部埋在地中），其高度和长度只要不影响牲口工作就可以。绞盘放在挖好的浅坑里，传动带从沟里引出。沟上搭木板便于牲口行走。
    二、绞关：这部分是由绞盘、立轴、马拉杆及绞盘底座十字架组成的。立轴是固定在绞盘中心的圆柱，下端穿过绞盘支在底座的碗形凹槽内，上端穿过支架横板孔，上下两端都可以转动。它是用硬木做的。马拉杆固定在立轴上，杆的长短要根据带动的机具需要多大的转速，多大动力，来适当确定。如果需要的动力大，转速小，就可以加长些；反之，就缩短一些。
    三、绞盘：马拉动马拉杆，绞盘就开始转动，随而带动传动带和传动轮，经过传动轮使作业机器也转起来了。绞盘可大可小。安家人民公社使用的有一点八公尺、二点六公尺、三点二公尺的三种直径。绞盘厚度三十公分（比传动带宽）。制造时用两根和绞盘直径一样长的方木柱，搭成十字架，再用八根细木支撑，搭成圆盘支架。再做一个同样大小的圆盘支架。两个支架叠合起来，上下和周围再用三公分厚的板钉起来。盘底有凸缘是为了使传动带滑不下去。
    传动部分有：传动带、主动轮、被动轮（统称传动轮）、传动轴、轴承。这个部分的作用是传递动力，变化速度。
    被动轮用多大的主动轮（指上一级主动轮，不是同轴杠的主动轮，绞盘也算主动轮）带动，才能够得出多大的转数，可以用下列公式计算：
    被动轮转速＝主动轮直径×主动轮转数÷被动轮直径
    如果转数不够，可以再加一级传动变速装置。一般来说，作业机器需要的转数越低，则转动级数越少；反之则传动级数越多。
    转数不够，还可以加大主动轮和被动轮的比数。安家人民公社第三级变速装置中，主动轮和被动轮（下一级）的比例是十九比一，大大超过书本理论不得超过八比一的规定。但是这种比例也不可以无限制地加大。
    安家人民公社绞关动力机带动几项作业机的数据列表如下：（附图表）附注：△表示无需这一项设备　＊安家人民公社用的是400瓦的发电机
