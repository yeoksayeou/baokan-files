    China's Sovereignty Over the Xisha Islands Is Absolutely Inviolable

    The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activities in infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty in the area of ​​China's Xisha Islands are becoming increasingly rampant. On February 20, South Vietnam dispatched warships and aircraft to intrude into the vicinity of China's Xisha Islands for reconnaissance; then, on February 22, the South Vietnamese navy brazenly hijacked five Chinese fishing boats, eighty-two fishermen, and a large amount of property on Chenhang Island in the Xisha Islands, and rudely tore up the national flag on Chinese fishing boats and on Chenhang Island. This is an act of provocation against the Chinese people planned by the South Vietnamese authorities! Every Chinese person cannot help but feel great indignation about this. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on February 27 regarding this incident, lodging a serious protest and warning with the South Vietnamese authorities.

    The purpose of the South Vietnamese authorities in creating this incident is to give people the impression that the Xisha Islands belong to South Vietnamese territory. In recent years, the South Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly clamored that they possess so-called "traditional sovereignty" over China's Xisha Islands. On February 25, the fourth day after the South Vietnamese navy hijacked Chinese fishermen, the South Vietnamese "Embassy" in Taiwan reiterated South Vietnam's "sovereign claim" to China's Xisha Islands. This is truly absurd to the extreme! The Xisha Islands have always been Chinese territory, so where does South Vietnam's "sovereign claim" come from? As early as the beginning of the fifteenth century, the island groups in the South China Sea, including the Nansha Islands, Dongsha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Xisha Islands, had already been incorporated into China's territory and became Chinese territory. At that time, the Chinese called the Xisha Islands "Qizhou Yang." Fei Xin, a geographer who followed Zheng He on his voyages to the "Western Seas," gave a detailed account of "Qizhou Yang" in his "Xingcha Shenglan." In the "Complete Geography of China" written by the French Jesuit priest Semedo in 1905, it was also confirmed that the "Qizhou Yang" in ancient Chinese books was the Xisha Islands. It can be seen that the Xisha Islands are Chinese territory, which has long been a fact recognized by the world. Although the Xisha Islands were occupied by Japan during World War II, these islands were returned to the then Chinese government on November 27, 1946, after Japan surrendered. Therefore, no one in the world can deny China's territorial sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. Now, the South Vietnamese authorities are actually making so-called "sovereign claims" to the Xisha Islands, wanting to seize Chinese territory. This is completely wishful thinking.

    For many years, U.S. imperialism has attempted to deny China's territorial sovereignty over the Xisha Islands and other islands in the South China Sea, but it has failed every time. In the draft of the U.S.-British separate peace treaty with Japan in 1951, the United States deliberately did not mention the issue of sovereignty over the Xisha Islands, which was a manifestation of this conspiracy. To this end, the Chinese government solemnly declared on August 15, 1951, that the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands, like the entire Nansha Islands, Dongsha Islands, and Zhongsha Islands, are Chinese territory. On May 29, 1956, in order to thwart the conspiracy of some ambitious elements in the Philippines to seize China's Nansha Islands by U.S. imperialism, the Chinese government made the same statement again. The South Vietnamese authorities are not unaware of all this, but they deliberately want to infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty in the Xisha Islands. What is the reason for this?

    Circumstances from all sides prove that the South Vietnamese authorities' outrageous act of infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty and hijacking Chinese fishermen was clearly carried out under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. In recent days, U.S. news agencies have been particularly interested in China's Xisha Islands, and their propaganda is echoing the activities of the South Vietnamese authorities. On the same day that the South Vietnamese navy hijacked Chinese fishermen, United Press International, in a dispatch from Tokyo, said that China was "colonizing" the Xisha Islands. The next day, the Associated Press said that China's "attempt to migrate to the Xisha Islands was unsuccessful." On February 26, United Press International shouted even louder: South Vietnam and China "both say they have sovereignty over the Xisha Islands," and "the Xisha Islands seem likely to become a new trouble spot in Southeast Asia today." How strange: The Chinese people carrying out productive activities on their own territory is actually called "colonization" and will cause "trouble" in Southeast Asia! These arguments are not worth refuting. It is worth noting that it is not others who are creating "trouble" everywhere in the Southeast Asian region recently, but the United States. The United States is launching a series of conspiracies in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and South Vietnam, creating tension in the region. The United States is instructing the South Vietnamese authorities to create "trouble" in China's Xisha Islands, which is also part of this conspiracy.

    However, it is absolutely not beneficial for the South Vietnamese authorities to willingly serve as pawns of the U.S. aggressors and be hostile to the Chinese people. The Xisha Islands are the sacred territory of the 650 million Chinese people, and no one is allowed to infringe upon them in any way. The South Vietnamese authorities must immediately release all the hijacked Chinese fishermen, compensate the fishermen for all their losses, and immediately stop any activities that infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty!

### 中国对西沙群岛的主权绝对不容侵犯

    中国对西沙群岛的主权绝对不容侵犯
    南越吴庭艳集团在我国西沙群岛地区侵犯我国领土主权的活动，是越来越猖狂了。2月20日，南越出动军舰和飞机侵入我国西沙群岛一带进行侦察；接着，在2月22日，南越海军竟公然在西沙群岛的琛航岛，劫走我国渔船五只，渔民八十二人，以及许多财物，并且无礼撕毁我国渔船上和琛航岛上的国旗。这是南越当局有计划地向我国人民挑衅的行为！每一个中国人民对此不能不感到极大的愤慨。我国外交部已于2月27日就这一事件发表声明，向南越当局提出严重抗议和警告。
    南越当局制造这一事件的目的，是想给人们造成一种印象，似乎西沙群岛是属于南越的领土。近几年来，南越当局曾经一再叫嚷它对我国的西沙群岛拥有所谓“传统主权”。2月25日，也就是在南越海军劫走我国渔民的第四天，南越驻台湾的“大使馆”重申南越对我国西沙群岛的
  “主权要求”。这真是荒唐到了极点！西沙群岛一向是中国的领土，何来南越的“主权要求”？远在十五世纪初，南中国海的各岛群，包括南沙群岛、东沙群岛、中沙群岛以及西沙群岛，就已经列入中国的版图，成为中国的领土。当时中国人把西沙群岛叫做“七洲洋”，跟随郑和“下西洋”的地理学家费信在他的“星槎胜览”中，曾有关于“七洲洋”的详细记载。在1905年出版的法国耶稣会教士夏之时著的“中国坤舆详志”中，也证实了中国古书上的
  “七洲洋”就是西沙群岛。可见，西沙群岛是中国的领土，早就是世界公认的事实。虽然在第二次世界大战中，西沙群岛被日本占领过，但是日本投降后，这些岛屿已于1946年11月27日归还当时的中国政府了。因此，世界上任何人也无法否认中国对西沙群岛的领土主权。现在，南越当局居然对西沙群岛提出所谓“主权要求”，想要攫取中国的领土，这完全是白日做梦。
    多年以来，美帝国主义曾经企图否认中国对西沙群岛及南中国海其他岛屿的领土主权，但是它每一次都失败了。在1951年制造的美英单独对日和约草案中，美国故意不提西沙群岛的主权问题，就是这种阴谋的表现。为此，我国政府在1951年8月15日曾庄严声明，西沙群岛和南威岛，正如整个南沙群岛、东沙群岛、中沙群岛一样，是中国的领土。1956年5月29日，为了粉碎美帝国主义利用菲律宾的某些野心分子侵占我国南沙群岛的阴谋，我国政府又作了同样的声明。所有这些，南越当局并不是不知道的，但是它却故意要侵犯中国在西沙群岛的领土主权。这究竟是什么原因呢？
    各方面的情况证明，南越当局侵犯我国领土主权，劫走我国渔民的猖狂行为，显然是在美帝国主义的指使下干出来的。最近几天，美国通讯社对我国西沙群岛特别感到兴趣，而它的宣传论调恰恰是同南越当局的活动互相呼应的。在南越海军劫走我国渔民的同一天，合众国际社发自东京的电讯就说，中国正向西沙群岛“殖民”。第二天，美联社又说，中国“向西沙群岛移民的尝试没有成功”。2月26日，合众国际社更大喊大叫：南越和中国“都说对西沙群岛拥有主权”，“西沙群岛今天似乎可能成为东南亚新的麻烦地点”。多么奇怪：中国人民在中国自己的领土上进行生产活动，竟然被称为“殖民”，并且还会造成东南亚的“麻烦”！这些论调是不值一驳的。值得注意的是，最近在东南亚地区到处制造“麻烦”的，不是别人，恰恰是美国。美国正在老挝、柬埔寨、泰国和南越展开一连串的阴谋活动，制造这个地区的紧张局势。美国指使南越当局在我国的西沙群岛制造“麻烦”，也正是这种阴谋活动的一部分。
    但是，南越当局甘心充当美国侵略者的马前卒，与中国人民为敌，这对于它自己是绝对没有任何便宜可占的。西沙群岛是六亿五千万中国人民的神圣领土，决不容许任何人采取任何方式加以侵犯。南越当局必须立即全部释放劫走的中国渔民，赔偿渔民的全部损失，并且立即停止侵犯中国领土主权的任何活动！
