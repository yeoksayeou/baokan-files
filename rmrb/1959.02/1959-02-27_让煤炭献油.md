    Let Coal Donate Oil
    The six coking plants in Baoding City, in just over three months, in addition to refining a large amount of coke, also recovered more than 110 tons of coal tar from coal smoke, and used these tars to process 40 kinds of products. This is indeed a good thing with multiple benefits.
    We know that coal has a wide range of uses. It is not only the food of industry, but also indispensable for agriculture, transportation, and people's daily life. However, today we often only use the part that is directly burned, which accounts for only about 15% of the coal. That is to say, for every 100 tons of coal we use, 85 tons are wasted, which is indeed a huge waste.
    Some people think that extracting oil from coal is just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve any problems. They don't know that what looks like a drop in the bucket, when concentrated, becomes a very large quantity. Baoding is not a large city, but merely from the coke ovens of six coking plants, more than 110 tons of coal tar were recovered in just over three months. Can this quantity be underestimated? Others believe that comprehensive utilization of coal is difficult due to equipment and technical strength, and cannot be done. This statement has some truth, but more important is whether the wisdom and talents of the broad masses can be brought into play to overcome difficulties. The Baoding Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led the city's masses to carry out a comprehensive coal utilization campaign, and used various indigenous methods to solve equipment and technical problems. This example should encourage us to build confidence and break the superstition of technology and equipment.
    This year, the national iron and steel industry needs 40 million tons of metallurgical coke, of which about 10 million tons are produced by indigenous methods. If Baoding City's practice of "every kiln produces coke and oil" is universally implemented in various regions, with an oil recovery rate of 0.5% to 1%, 50,000 to 100,000 tons of coal tar can be recovered. What a great force this will play in ensuring the leap forward in transportation this year! Therefore, we hope that in areas with better coal resource conditions, such as coal industrial bases, distribution centers for industrial and civilian coal, and near large coal washing plants, the business of recovering coal tar can be universally established, so that coal can contribute more to the great leap forward in our industry and agriculture.

### 让煤炭献油

    让煤炭献油
    保定市的六个炼焦厂，在短短三个多月里，除了炼出了大量的焦炭以外，还从煤烟里取回来一百一十多吨焦油，用这些焦油加工了四十种产品，这确是一举多得的好事。
    我们知道：煤的用途很广，它不仅仅是工业的食粮，而且也是农业、交通运输及人民日常生活上必不可少的。可是，我们今天往往只使用了它直接燃烧的部分，这部分只占煤炭的15％左右。也就是说，我们用一百吨煤炭，就有八十五吨被白白扔掉了，这的确是一种极大的浪费。
    有些人认为从煤炭里提炼油，只是一星半点，解决不了什么问题。他们不知道：看起来是一星半点，集中起来，就是很大的数量。保定这个城市不算大，可是仅仅从六个炼焦厂的焦窑里，在三个多月内，就取回了一百一十多吨焦油。这个数量，难道可以轻估吗？还有些人认为：综合利用煤炭，设备技术力量有困难，搞不了。这种说法有一定的道理，但更重要的还在于能不能发挥广大群众的聪明才智，来克服困难。中共保定市委领导全市群众开展煤炭综合利用运动，采用各种土办法解决了设备和技术问题，这个事例应当使我们鼓起信心，打破对技术设备的迷信。
    今年全国钢铁工业需要四千万吨冶金焦，其中约有一千万吨是土法炼焦。如果各地普遍推行保定市“窑窑出焦必出油”的做法，以收油率0.5％到1％计算，就可以回收五万到十万吨焦油，这对于保证今年交通运输的跃进，将发挥多么大的力量！因此，我们希望在煤炭资源条件较好的地区，如煤炭工业基地、工业和民用煤的集散地、大的洗煤厂附近，普遍地把回收焦油的事业办起来，让煤炭为我们工农业的大跃进贡献更多的力量。
