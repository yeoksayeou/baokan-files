China's Economic and Trade Exhibition in Zanzibar Opens to Warm Welcome

China's great achievements are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought

Tanzania's First Vice President Karume Speaks at the Opening Ceremony, Praising China's Construction Achievements

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zanzibar, August 19th: The China Economic and Trade Exhibition opened in the afternoon of the 18th in Zanzibar. Tanzania's First Vice President Karume cut the ribbon for the exhibition.

In the central hall of the exhibition entrance, a giant statue of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, stands tall, with many vibrant red flags as the backdrop.

Karume delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, praising China's great achievements in economic construction, and wished the exhibition a successful opening.

This exhibition reflects the general situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, displaying the works of our great leader Chairman Mao and models and pictures of the achievements made by the revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought during the Cultural Revolution. The exhibition also displays a large number of industrial and agricultural products, artworks, and handicrafts.

Accompanied by Liu Gan, the Chinese Consul to Zanzibar, and Wang Buyun, the Director of the Chinese Exhibition Hall, Karume visited the exhibition. He showed great interest in viewing the photographs of Chairman Mao inspecting hundreds of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students in Beijing a year ago, as well as the industrial and agricultural products produced by Chinese revolutionary workers and peasants in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize revolution and promote production."

Many spectators from Zanzibar enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought. They said: All the great achievements of the Chinese people are due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. A friend from Zanzibar wrote in the guest book: "This exhibition is excellent! It reflects the great victories achieved by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in guiding the Chinese people to build a great socialist China and turn China into a fortress of the world revolution. The great achievements of China in politics, economy, and culture, as embodied in this exhibition, vividly prove the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

A freedom fighter from Mozambique told the staff of the Chinese exhibition hall: "This exhibition is a great classroom for us Mozambican youth. I hope that Mozambican youth, in their struggle for national liberation, will learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, especially the Red Guards, in the Cultural Revolution."

    据新华社桑给巴尔十九日电　中国经济和贸易展览会十八日下午在桑给巴尔开幕。坦桑尼亚第一副总统卡鲁姆，为展览会剪彩。

    卡鲁姆在中国驻桑给巴尔领事刘干和中国展览馆馆长王步云的陪同下，参观了展览会，他以极大的兴趣观看了毛主席一年前在北京检阅几百万红卫兵和革命师生的照片，以及中国革命工人和农民热烈响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召而生产出来的工农业产品。
    许多桑给巴尔观众都热烈赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说：中国人民的一切伟大成就归功于毛主席的正确领导。一位桑给巴尔朋友在留言簿上写道：“这个展览会好极了！它反映出战无不胜的毛泽东思想在指导中国人民建设伟大的社会主义中国，把中国变成为世界人民革命堡垒方面所取得的伟大胜利。展览会所体现的中国在政治、经济和文化方面的伟大成就，生动地证明了毛泽东思想的胜利。毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
    来自莫三鼻给的一位非洲自由战士对中国展览馆工作人员说：“这个展览会对我们莫三鼻给青年来说是一个大课堂。我希望莫三鼻给青年在争取民族解放的斗争中，将效法中国人民，特别是红卫兵在文化大革命中的革命精神。”
