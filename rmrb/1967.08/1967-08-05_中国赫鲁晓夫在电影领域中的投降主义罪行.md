For seventeen years, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has been manipulating a small clique of anti-revolutionary revisionists like Xia Yan in the film industry. Besides producing a large number of anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous films, he has also opened the green light for foreign reactionary films, using them to numb and poison the masses, serving his goal of restoring capitalism.

The surrenderist stance of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has a long history. In April 1949, he shouted, "The problems in the cultural sphere should not be taken too seriously. The Chinese people have been watching American films for decades, and the Chinese revolution still triumphed." Everyone knows that American films are an important tool of cultural aggression in the hands of American imperialism. In the decades before our liberation, American films flooded in, poisoning the people everywhere. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the big thing we should have done in the film industry was to immediately eradicate these spiritual opiums. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party jumped out at this time, wiping out the heinous crimes of American films poisoning and numbing the Chinese people for decades, and openly allowing American films to continue to spread freely on our screens. It was under his advocacy that many major cities in China still screened a large number of American reactionary films in the early days of liberation, such as "The Thirteenth Female Thief," "Underwater Bombshell," "The Naked and the Dead," and so on. In liberated New China, such a shocking phenomenon appeared, which is intolerable!

Does the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party really think that cultural issues should not be taken too seriously? No, this cunning counter-revolutionary knows very well the importance of cultural issues. Otherwise, why was he so active in opening the green light for American films? Why did he immediately support his group of ghosts and demons to shoot films like "Happy Farm," which advocate individual enrichment and advocate the capitalist road? Why did he eagerly produce films like "Sparking the Prairie," which are poisonous films for his own glorification, and "Visiting Indonesia"? Why did he openly praise the American pornographic film "Emerging Lotus," saying, "This film is good, it can let cadres see it"? Why did he praise a French film full of decadence and hysteria, "The French View of America," saying, "This film is good"?

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party's plot to use foreign reactionary films to serve his counter-revolutionary restoration activities was exposed again in his speech to the old Cultural Department Party Committee on March 8, 1956. He instructed the old Cultural Department Party Group, "Films from all countries in the world should be brought in," "Some reformism is not to be feared, no harm is done." Look, the 1956 China's Khrushchev is even more advanced than the 1949 China's Khrushchev. As the struggle for power in the cultural and ideological sphere intensifies, he also develops from defending American films to "films from all countries in the world should be brought in." Not only does he say that "reformism is not to be feared," but he also openly declares that reformism is "harmless"! What is reformism? It is capitalism! It is to make our people return to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, and fall into the depths of misery again.

The surrenderist face of China's Khrushchev is also prominently revealed in his enthusiastic praise and protection of a Soviet revisionist reactionary film called "Przhevalsky." This Soviet reactionary film describes a military spy in the imperialist era named Przhevalsky, who wore the cloak of an "explorer." After watching this film, China's Khrushchev praised it highly, openly affirming that the film's "theme is positive" and agreeing to its domestic release. He also told Zhou Yang that "the tsar and Western imperialism are different, imperialist explorers and Western explorers are different," saying that imperialist explorers are "friendly to the Chinese people." This is truly a case of the guilty fearing exposure, the more one covers up, the more it is revealed.

The main character of this reactionary film, Przhevalsky, is a real person. He was a general of the tsarist Russia in the late 19th century. He actively suppressed the Polish people's uprising and later, under the guise of exploration, went to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Tibet in our country to carry out military espionage activities, stealing a large number of military astronomical and topographical data. When the British imperialists launched a military invasion of our Tibet, he was appointed as the head of a powerful expeditionary force, serving as the vanguard for the British imperialists to march into Lhasa! The reactionary film "Przhevalsky," in order to beautify this spy, shamelessly distorted history, covering his military espionage activities with a beautiful cloak of so-called pure academic research, "for the glory of the motherland," and so on. However, no matter how clever the disguise, it is bound to reveal the tail. Przhevalsky even claimed a mountain range in our Tibet as his new discovery. What new discovery is this? These places have been an inseparable part of our great motherland since ancient times. The film vigorously advocates this "new discovery," which clearly exposes the wolfish ambitions of Przhevalsky and the tsarist imperialism, doesn't it?

But China's Khrushchev actually said, "The tsar and Western imperialism are different, imperialist explorers and Western explorers are different." We must ask, what is the difference between tsarist Russia and Western imperialism? Chairman Mao, in his article "Farewell Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," once listed the heinous crimes committed by tsarist Russia against the Chinese people. Lenin also once angrily pointed out: "The governments of European countries (probably the Russian government first) have begun to partition China.... They plunder China just as they plunder the property of the dead, and as soon as this pseudo-dead person tries to resist, they pounce on him like beasts." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has completely stood on the side of the enemy condemned by Lenin, which does not prove that he is a traitor to Leninism?

In foreign countries, they kowtow to imperialism, and at home, they support the bourgeoisie. This is the inevitable path taken by modern revisionists to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. China's Khrushchev is no exception. He strongly supports, praises, and promotes various reactionary films, which is an important step in his propaganda preparation for usurping the Party and the government.

    中国赫鲁晓夫在电影领域中的投降主义罪行
    中国影协革命造反委员会
    十七年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在电影界指使夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，除了大量炮制反党反社会主义的毒草影片外，还为外国反动影片大开绿灯，丧心病狂地利用它们来麻醉和毒害群众，为他复辟资本主义服务。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的投降主义由来已久。一九四九年四月，他就叫嚷什么：“对文艺界的问题，不必看得太严重，中国人看美国电影看了几十年，中国革命还不是胜利了。”大家都知道，美国电影是完全被掌握在美帝国主义手里的一个重要文化侵略工具。在我国解放前的几十年里美国影片曾大量侵入，到处毒害人民。中国人民革命胜利了，我们在电影方面的一件大事，应当是立即铲除这些精神鸦片。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这时却跳了出来，把美国电影过去几十年来毒害麻醉中国人民的滔天罪行一笔勾销，公然允许美国电影继续在我国银幕上自由泛滥。正是在他的提倡下，解放初期我国许多大城市仍然大量上映美国反动影片，什么《十三号女盗》、《海底肉弹》、《神经战》等等。在解放了的新中国，居然出现了这种令人气愤的怪现象，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派真的认为不必把文艺问题看得太严重了么？不，这个富有反革命经验的家伙是很懂得文艺问题的重要性的。否则，他为什么那样积极地为美帝的电影大开绿灯呢？他为什么紧接着就支持他手下的一帮牛鬼蛇神，拍摄了象《农家乐》之类鼓吹个人发家致富、鼓吹走资本主义道路的毒草影片呢？他为什么要热中于炮制为他自己树碑立传的《燎原》，以及《访问印尼》这样一些毒草影片呢？他为什么要公开宣扬美国黄色影片《出水芙蓉》，说什么“这种片子很好嘛，可以让干部看看”呢？他为什么要替一部充满色情、颓废和歇斯底里的法国影片《法国人眼中的美国》叫好，连称“这部片子不错”呢？可见，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所说的“不必看得太严重”，无非是想麻痹革命群众，妄图诱使我们忽视意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，以便于他们越来越猖狂地利用文艺，利用电影来为他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的制造舆论。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派阴谋利用外国反动影片来为他的反革命复辟活动服务的另一次大暴露，是他在一九五六年三月八日对旧文化部党委的一次讲话。他指示旧文化部党组说，“世界各国的电影都要搞进来”，“有些改良主义也不怕，无害即行。”看，一九五六年的中国赫鲁晓夫比一九四九年的中国赫鲁晓夫又更进了一步。随着文化思想领域内夺权斗争的日趋激烈，他也从为美国电影辩护，而发展到“世界各国”的反动影片“都要搞进来”了。不仅说“改良主义也不怕”，而且公然宣布改良主义是“无害”的了！什么改良主义？就是资本主义！就是要我国人民回到半封建半殖民地的老路上去，重新陷于水深火热之中。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫的投降主义嘴脸，还突出地表现在他对一部名叫《普勒热瓦尔斯基》的苏修反动影片的百般吹捧和包庇上。这部苏联反动影片，描写的是帝俄时代一个披着“探险家”外衣的军事特务分子普勒热瓦尔斯基。中国的赫鲁晓夫看完这部影片之后，连声叫好，公然肯定这部影片的“主题是积极的”，同意在国内发行。他还对周扬说什么“沙皇和西方帝国主义不同，帝俄探险家和西方探险家不同”，说帝俄的探险家“是和中国人民友好的”。这真是作贼心虚，欲盖弥彰。
    这部反动影片的主角普勒热瓦尔斯基是实有其人的。这个人是十九世纪下半叶的一个沙皇俄国的将军。他积极镇压波兰人民起义，后来曾经多次以所谓探险的名义，到我国新疆、青海、西藏一带进行军事特务活动，搞走了一大批天文、地形的军事资料。而当英帝国主义对我国西藏进行武装侵略时，他又被任命为一支实力雄厚的远征队的头目，为英帝国主义充当了进军拉萨的马前卒！《普勒热瓦尔斯基》这部反动影片为了美化这个特务，竟无耻地篡改历史，给他的军事特务活动，披上了一件所谓进行纯学术考察呀，什么为了“祖国的荣誉”呀等等美丽的外衣。但是，再巧妙的装扮，也免不了要露出马脚。普勒热瓦尔斯基竟把我国西藏的一条山脉当作他的新发现。这叫什么新发现？这些地方自古以来就是我们伟大祖国不可分割的领土。影片竭力鼓吹这种新发现，难道不正是清楚地暴露了普勒热瓦尔斯基和沙俄帝国主义的狼子野心么？
    但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫居然说，“沙皇和西方帝国主义不同，帝俄探险家和西方探险家不同”。我们要问，沙皇俄国和西方帝国主义究竟有什么不同？毛主席在《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》一文中，曾历数了沙皇俄国对中国人民犯下的滔天罪行。列宁也曾愤怒地指出：“欧洲各国政府（最先恐怕是俄国政府）已经开始瓜分中国了。……它们盗窃中国，就象盗窃死人的财物一样，一旦这个假死人试图反抗，它们就象野兽一样猛扑到他身上。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派完全站到了象列宁所谴责的敌人的立场上去说话，不正说明他就是列宁主义的叛徒吗？
    在国外屈从于帝国主义，在国内扶植资产阶级，这是现代修正主义者为颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义所必然走的道路。中国的赫鲁晓夫当然也不例外。他大力支持、吹捧和推销形形色色的反动影片，正是他为篡党篡政而进行舆论准备的一个重要步骤。
