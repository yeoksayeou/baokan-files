The top capitalist-roader within the Party, following the traitorous teachings of Khrushchev, fervently advocates the line of capitulationism, fundamentally betraying the proletarian revolution. The reactionary film *Visit to Indonesia* is a record of the crimes of China's Khrushchev in kneeling and surrendering to the imperialists, revisionists, and the Indonesian reactionaries.

Chairman Mao said: "The attainment of world peace mainly depends on the resolute struggle of the peoples of the world." The peoples of the world can only achieve liberation by using revolutionary armed struggle to oppose counter-revolutionary armed struggle, and by resolutely overthrowing imperialism and all its running dogs. We must not place our hopes on the "wisdom" of imperialism and its running dogs. However, China's Khrushchev, during his 1963 visit to Indonesia, fervently advocated the revisionist line. He bowed down before the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, embraced and danced with them, and spent the whole day mixing with them. He shamelessly praised the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie as "leaders of Asian-African solidarity" and "great friends of the Chinese people." This head of state of a socialist country actually fraternized with the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie and shook hands warmly with the great butcher Nasution, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Indonesian people. This fully shows that he is a reliable friend of these reactionary bourgeoisie. During his nine-day visit to Indonesia, China's Khrushchev completely surrendered to the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, doing everything in his power to act like a slave, performing a grand farce of surrendering to the Indonesian reactionaries.

China's Khrushchev's treacherous deeds in Indonesia were not accidental. In 1957, he had already shouted about how "permanent peace for humanity has a chance of realization." In 1959, he shamelessly spread the lie of "maintaining peace." Even more shamelessly, in a report, he blatantly declared, "The policy of peaceful coexistence does not exclude any country. We also have the wish to peacefully coexist with the United States." China's Khrushchev picked up the broken pieces of Soviet Khrushchev, actually wanting to "peacefully coexist" with the arch-enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, thereby fundamentally erasing the life-and-death class struggle between socialism and capitalism. During his stay in Indonesia, he also spread unrealistic illusions about the reactionary bourgeoisie, numbing the fighting will of the Indonesian people and the peoples of the world. China's Khrushchev is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary revisionist.

Chairman Mao said: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the Khrushchev sleeping by our side. His trip to Indonesia greatly boosted the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and the Indonesian reactionaries, and greatly dampened the fighting spirit of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle. Debts must be repaid. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle the accounts of the crimes committed by this China's Khrushchev, and fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him into oblivion!

    打倒“投降主义”的吹鼓手
    北京卫戍区某部　陈健民
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派秉承赫鲁晓夫的叛徒教义，狂热地鼓吹投降主义路线，从根本上背叛了无产阶级革命。反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》就是中国的赫鲁晓夫向帝、修和印尼反动派屈膝投降的罪行录。
    毛主席说：“世界和平的取得，主要应当依靠各国人民的坚决斗争。”世界各国人民要获得解放，必须用革命的武装来反对反革命的武装，坚决打倒帝国主义及其一切走狗，决不能把希望寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上面。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫在一九六三年访问印尼期间，却狂热地鼓吹修正主义路线。他拜倒在印尼反动资产阶级面前，和他们拥抱、跳舞，整天鬼混在一起。他无耻地吹捧印尼资产阶级头面人物是“亚非团结的领袖”，“是中国人民的伟大朋友”。他这个堂堂的社会主义国家的“元首”，竟然同印尼的资产阶级头面人物称兄道弟，同双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的大刽子手纳苏蒂安握手言欢。这充分说明了他是这些反动资产阶级的忠实可靠的朋友。在访问印尼的九天之中，中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这样一头栽倒在印尼反动资产阶级的怀抱中，竭尽奴颜婢膝之能事，扮演了一场向印尼反动派屈膝投降的大丑剧。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在印尼的叛卖行径并不是偶然的。一九五七年他就叫嚷过什么“人类的持久和平已经有了实现的希望”。一九五九年他又无耻地散布什么“为了维护和平”的谰言。更无耻的是，他在一次报告中竟露骨地叫嚣“和平共处政策不排斥任何国家。对于美国，我们也同样具有同它和平共处的愿望”。中国的赫鲁晓夫拣起了苏联的赫鲁晓夫的破烂，竟然要与全世界人民的死敌美帝国主义“和平共处”，从而根本上抹杀了社会主义同资本主义之间的你死我活的阶级斗争，这是十足的叛徒哲学。在印尼期间，他还散布对反动的资产阶级不切实际的幻想，麻痹印尼人民和世界各国人民的斗争意志。中国的赫鲁晓夫是一个彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义分子。
    毛主席说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。他的印尼之行，大长帝、修和印尼反动派的威风，大挫印尼人民革命斗争的锐气。欠债总是要偿还的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫所犯下的罪行一一清算，把他彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
