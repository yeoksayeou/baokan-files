Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force units have enthusiastically responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." On August 21, they achieved another brilliant victory on the frontline of defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, annihilating two invading U.S. aircraft and capturing one American air pirate. This battle was fought bravely and tenaciously, swiftly and decisively. As soon as the U.S. aggressor aircraft entered our airspace, they were immediately struck with devastating blows.

This brilliant achievement is a new victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought. It once again demonstrates the invincible might of the People's Liberation Army of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

With revolutionary fervor, we extend our warmest congratulations and pay our highest revolutionary respects to the heroic air force units that have made new contributions in defending our sacred airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Our great commander Chairman Mao has pointed out that regarding imperialism and domestic and foreign reactionaries, "If they want to fight, we will annihilate them thoroughly. That's how it is. They attack, and we annihilate them. The more we annihilate, the more comfortable they will be. Annihilate thoroughly, and they will be thoroughly comfortable."

The U.S. imperialists have already suffered a crushing defeat in South Vietnam and are at their wits' end. Now they are trying to use escalated bombing to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and save their own lives. While the U.S. aggressors are conducting their war of adventure in Vietnam, they have brazenly sent aircraft to invade our airspace and provoke us.

Well, since the U.S. imperialists insist on challenging the Chinese people, let them come and try. The People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have never been soft on retaliating against U.S. imperialist aggression. You dare to come, and we will definitely fight, and we will fight until you are left with nothing.

Recently, the U.S. gangster leader Johnson has been saying that the U.S. escalation in the Vietnam War is not to pose any threat to Communist China. This is a smoke screen. The invasion of U.S. gangster aircraft into our country is not just a threat but a blatant act of war provocation against our people. Johnson, put away your tricks. The Chinese people have long seen through the aggressive nature of your gang. The Chinese people are well prepared and standing in full readiness. If you dare to impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely see it through to the end.

The great People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are the reliable pillars of our proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is precisely such a powerful revolutionary army that, day and night, defends our territory, seas, and airspace, defends the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is always ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time; it is precisely such an excellent people's army that has excellently completed the arduous tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. Without such an army, we would not be able to launch this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; without such an army, we would not be able to thoroughly smash the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by China's Khrushchev and achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The U.S. imperialists and all domestic and foreign reactionaries hate our army the most. All revolutionary comrades must always be vigilant and expose the enemy's tricks. All revolutionary masses must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," maintain the high prestige of the People's Liberation Army, cherish the People's Liberation Army, support the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army.

The army and the people must unite closely, build a solid wall of steel, and annihilate thoroughly and completely any invaders!

    有来犯者必定坚决彻底干净全部消灭之
    我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，热烈响应我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召。八月二十一日，他们在保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战线上又取得了辉煌的胜利，一举全歼入侵美机两架，活捉美国飞贼一名。这一仗打得勇猛顽强，干脆利落，美国强盗飞机刚一钻进我国领空，就立即遭到毁灭性的打击。
    这个辉煌战绩，是伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利。它再一次显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民解放军的威力，是无可匹敌的。
    我们满怀革命的豪情，向在保卫我国的神圣领空，保卫无产阶级文化大革命中立下了新的功勋的英雄的空军部队，表示最热烈的祝贺，致以最崇高的革命敬礼！
    我们伟大统帅毛主席指出，对于帝国主义和国内外反动派，“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”
    美帝国主义在南越已经一败涂地，走投无路。于是它又企图用扩大轰炸来压迫越南人民求和，救它一命。美国侵略者在越南进行战争冒险的同时，竟悍然派飞机侵入我国领空进行挑衅。
    好吧，美帝国主义既然硬是要来同中国人民较量较量，就让它来试一试吧。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军和中国人民，对于回击美帝国主义的侵略，从来不会手软。你们敢来，我们就一定打，一定打得你们片甲不留。
    美国强盗头子约翰逊最近说什么美国在越南战争“升级”，不是为了构成对共产党中国的“任何威胁”。这是一种烟幕弹。美国强盗飞机入侵我国，已经不仅仅是什么“威胁”，而是对我国人民明目张胆的战争挑衅。约翰逊，收起你这一套鬼花招吧。中国人民早已看透你们这一伙强盗的侵略本性。中国人民早已作好准备，严阵以待。如果你们胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们就坚决奉陪到底。
    伟大的中国人民解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他们是我国无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命的可靠支柱。正是这样一支强大的革命军队，夜以继日地保卫着我国的领土、领海和领空，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，随时随地准备歼灭一切来犯的敌人；正是这样一支优秀的人民军队，出色地完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的艰巨任务。没有这样一支军队，我们就不可能发动这一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命；没有这样一支军队，我们就不可能彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    美帝国主义和国内外一切反动派，最仇恨我们的军队。一切革命的同志一定要时刻提高警惕，识破敌人的阴谋诡计。一切革命群众，一定要响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，维护人民解放军的崇高威信，爱护人民解放军，支持人民解放军，学习人民解放军。
    军民紧密团结起来，筑成坚固的铜墙铁壁，有来犯者，必定坚决彻底干净全部消灭之！
