The revolutionary faction of the Qingdao Fertilizer Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. They have warmly assisted cadres who have made mistakes to return to the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, enabling them to play an active role in promoting revolution and production. Currently, over 70% of the middle and senior leaders in the factory have stepped forward, with one-third of them participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs at various levels.

Many cadres in the factory initially followed the bourgeois reactionary line to varying degrees. After the revolutionary faction seized power, although they were not sidelined, they carried heavy mental burdens, hesitated, and dared not take responsibility for their work. Some cadres who had been criticized during the movement were particularly cautious and full of concerns.

How can we help revolutionary cadres truly liberate themselves politically? The revolutionary committee of the factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, adopted the method of short-term concentrated study. They organized middle and senior leaders to study Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," while addressing the problems they encountered during the Cultural Revolution. They also participated in the city-wide criticism meetings against the top capitalist-roader within the party. Through study and practical struggle, they realized that only by correctly handling their relationship with revolutionary masses, actively exposing and criticizing the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and completely breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line, could they truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary committee also addressed various ideological issues among the cadres. They organized them to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's relevant quotations on serving the people, focusing on the question of "what it means to truly step forward." Some cadres said that although they often studied Chairman Mao's works in the past, they mainly did so to solve work problems or to help others with their ideological issues, rarely using it to transform their worldview. Only now do they truly understand that without overcoming selfishness, the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act would not be established.

To better enable revolutionary leading cadres to play a backbone role in the "three-in-one combination," the revolutionary faction encouraged and supported them to work boldly. They consulted with them on all matters, sought their opinions, and let them preside over work and meetings.

The electrical workshop once experienced issues such as workers not reporting for work on time, leaving their posts randomly, and not paying attention to safe operations due to differing opinions among the workers. The original workshop director and member of the revolutionary committee's workshop subcommittee, Li Yanshen, criticized these phenomena in a workshop meeting. After the meeting, some workers were dissatisfied with his criticism. Upon learning this, the revolutionary faction members of the workshop subcommittee immediately talked to Li Yanshen, expressing their firm support for his actions and encouraging him to speak out and manage more in the future. They also promptly criticized the phenomenon of neglecting labor discipline among the masses. They told the workshop staff that the revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination," since they were elected by everyone, should respect their leadership. Different opinions could be raised and jointly resolved, but anarchism should not be allowed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out a common cause, and prevent the tendency of sectarianism." To enable new and old cadres to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to better help and learn from each other, the standing committee of the revolutionary committee adopted the method of pairing new and old cadres and having the old guide the new in work assignments. Revolutionary leading cadres, on one hand, actively learned the revolutionary spirit of the young revolutionary faction members, and on the other hand, patiently helped them quickly mature politically, organizationally, and professionally. In the first half of May, a serious production stoppage occurred in a workshop. At this time, the original deputy factory director and standing committee member of the revolutionary committee, Ren Zhong, together with the comrades of the production command department, found the workshop's production managers to jointly study the causes of the production stoppage. They then participated in production at the class level, directly understanding the situation. They subsequently convened a full workshop meeting, laying out all the current production problems and mobilizing everyone to jointly study and solve them. Through meticulous political and ideological work, the workers' production enthusiasm greatly increased, and they collectively improved the equipment. The production plan for May was completed by over 90%.

Due to the revolutionary committee's implementation of Chairman Mao's policies on cadres with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs fully played their role. The factory's revolution and production have both shown a great situation. Despite the production task increasing by nearly one-third compared to last year, the first half-year production plan was overfulfilled.

    青岛化肥厂无产阶级革命派掌权后认真执行毛主席的干部政策
    积极支持革命领导干部大胆工作
    新老干部取长补短，齐心协力抓革命促生产，全厂一派大好形势
    本报讯　青岛化肥厂无产阶级革命派在解放军同志的帮助下，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，热情帮助犯错误的干部回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，让他们在抓革命促生产中发挥积极作用。现在，这个厂已有百分之七十多的中上层领导干部站了出来，其中三分之一的人参加了各级“三结合”临时权力机构。
    这个厂的不少干部在运动初期都不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线。无产阶级革命派夺权后，他们虽然没有靠边站，但是思想负担较重，缩手缩脚，对工作不敢大胆负责。一些在运动中受过批判的干部，更是怕字当头，顾虑重重。
    怎样才能帮助革命干部真正从政治思想上解放出来呢？厂革委会在解放军同志帮助下，采取短期集中学习的方法，组织中上层领导干部带着在文化大革命中所遇到的问题，学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》以及《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》的有关社论，同时让他们参加全市对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判大会。通过学习和参加实际斗争，他们认识到只有正确对待革命群众，积极起来揭发批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，才能真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    厂革委会还针对干部中存在的各种思想问题，进一步组织他们带着自己的活思想学习“老三篇”和毛主席有关为人民服务的语录，然后对“怎样才算真正站出来”这个问题进行讨论。有的干部说，过去虽然也经常学习毛主席著作，但那时候学习多是为了解决工作上的问题，或是为了帮助别人解决思想问题，很少用来改造自己的世界观。现在才真正认识到，不打倒私字，敢想、敢干的革命精神就树立不起来。
    为了更好地让革命领导干部在“三结合”中发挥骨干作用，无产阶级革命派鼓励和支持他们大胆工作，凡事先同他们商量，征求他们的意见，并让他们主持工作和会议。
    电气车间由于工人们观点不统一，一度出现了上班不按时、随便离开生产岗位和不注意安全操作等现象。原车间主任、革委会车间分会委员李延信，在一次车间大会上对这些现象提出了批评。会后，有的工人对他的批评很不满意。厂革委会车间分会的革命派同志知道后，马上找李延信谈话，表示坚决支持他的行动，同时鼓励他以后还应该多说多管。对群众中存在的忽视劳动纪律的现象，革命派同志也及时提出了批评。他们对车间职工说，参加“三结合”的革命领导干部，既然是大家推选出来的，就应该尊重他们的领导，有不同意见可以提出，共同商量解决，不能闹无政府主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”为了使新老干部取长补短，更好地互相帮助，互相学习，厂革委会常委在工作分工方面，采取了新老搭配、以老带新的办法。革命领导干部一方面积极学习革命派青年同志的革命闯劲，一方面耐心地帮助他们在政治上、组织能力上和业务上很快地成熟起来。五月上半月，有一个车间发生了严重的停产事故。这个时候，原生产副厂长、革委会常委任重同志，就同生产指挥部的同志们一块，找车间管生产的同志共同研究发生停产事故的原因，同时深入班组参加生产，直接了解情况。他们接着召开了全车间大会，把当前生产上存在的问题全部摆出来，发动大家共同研究解决。经过细致的政治思想工作，工人们的生产积极性大大提高，并且群策群力改进设备，五月份生产计划完成百分之九十以上。
    由于这个厂的革委会在解放军同志的帮助下贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，充分发挥了革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的作用，全厂革命和生产都出现了一派大好形势，在生产任务比去年增加将近三分之一的情况下，超额完成了上半年生产计划。
