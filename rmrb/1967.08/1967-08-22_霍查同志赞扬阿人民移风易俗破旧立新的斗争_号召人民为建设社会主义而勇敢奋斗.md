Comrade Hoxha praises the Albanian people's struggle to change customs and build a new society
Calls on the people to bravely strive for the construction of socialism

NEW DELHI, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) — The beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, on August 12 wrote a reply to the parents of a group of voluntary laborers from Lekbibaj Village, Tropoja District, who participated in the construction of the Logaricë-Fieri railway. He warmly praised them for joining their children in the struggle to change customs and build a new society.

The reply said that the parents' support for their children in bravely breaking away from old habits and establishing progressive new customs is a great encouragement to them. This also proves that the Party's policy of thoroughly liberating women is correct and is supported by the people.

The letter said that the parents and their children unanimously expressed their determination to forever preserve the glorious title of the Gjergj Leka Voluntary Labor Brigade. This is a great encouragement to the children and to all Albanian youth.

The reply expressed the belief that the people of Tropoja District, with their patriotic revolutionary traditions, will exert all their strength for the further prosperity of the socialist motherland and bravely struggle to better implement the Party's instructions for the liberation of Albanian women.

Gjergj Leka is the name of an Albanian martyr. One hundred and eight young women from Lekbibaj Village, to build their own country, formed a Gjergj Leka Labor Brigade and went to build the Logaricë-Fieri railway. In addition to participating in labor, they also fought against heavy and backward customs, arranged marriages, and the contempt for women on the construction site. Recently, they successfully completed their mission and returned to their hometown.

    回信表示深信，具有爱国革命传统的特罗波雅区人民，将为社会主义祖国的进一步繁荣而发挥一切力量，为更好地贯彻党为解放阿尔巴尼亚妇女的指示而勇敢奋斗。
    格杰洛什·拉马是阿尔巴尼亚一位烈士的名字。列克比巴乡一百零八名女青年为了建设自己的祖国，组成了一支格杰洛什·拉马劳动队，前往修建洛格齐恩—费里铁路。她们除了参加劳动外，在工地上还进行反对沉重落后的服饰、包办婚姻、轻视妇女的斗争。最近，她们胜利地完成了任务，回到了自己的家乡。
