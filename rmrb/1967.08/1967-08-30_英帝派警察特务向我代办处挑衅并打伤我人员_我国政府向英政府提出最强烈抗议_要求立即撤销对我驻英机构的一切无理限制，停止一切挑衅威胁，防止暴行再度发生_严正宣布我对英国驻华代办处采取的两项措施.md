British imperialist police and spies provoked and injured our personnel. The Chinese government lodged the strongest protest with the British government, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all unreasonable restrictions on our institutions in Britain, the cessation of all provocations and threats, and the prevention of further atrocities. The Chinese government solemnly announced two measures taken against the British office in China.

New China News Agency, August 30th: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Luo Guibo, urgently summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopkinson, in the early hours of today. He lodged the most urgent, most serious, and strongest protest against the British government for repeatedly sending large numbers of police and spies to provoke our office in Britain and other institutions, and for inciting police and thugs to assault our office personnel. He also announced two measures taken by the Chinese government against the British office in China.

Vice Minister Luo Guibo pointed out: In recent days, the British government has repeatedly sent large numbers of police and plainclothes spies to surround the Chinese office in Britain and its affiliated business institutions, the New China News Agency London branch, and the Bank of China London branch, conducting various provocations. On the morning of August 29th, the British government again incited thugs to assault our office personnel; in the afternoon of the same day, the British government went even further by ordering police and thugs to provoke again. British police openly wielded batons and savagely beat our office personnel. Preliminary reports indicate that three of our office personnel were severely injured and more than ten were lightly injured. The Chinese government lodges the most urgent, most serious, and strongest protest against the British government for these savage atrocities.

Luo Guibo said, the Chinese government demands that the British government immediately take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such atrocities, provide medical treatment for the injured, ensure the safety of all personnel in the Chinese diplomatic representative institutions and news and business institutions in Britain, and punish the perpetrators and compensate for the damages. The Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands.

Vice Minister Luo Guibo said, it must be pointed out that the occurrence of the above events is not accidental. On August 22nd, the British government had already taken illegal measures against the Chinese office in Britain and other institutions, unreasonably restricting the freedom of movement and action of Chinese diplomatic personnel and staff in Britain, and attempting to disrupt the normal diplomatic communications of the Chinese office in Britain.

Luo Guibo said, the British government's series of illegal measures and savage actions are a continuation of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities' frenzied fascist suppression of Chinese compatriots. The Chinese government must ask the British government, where do you intend to lead the relations between China and Britain?

He pointed out that the British government must immediately withdraw all unreasonable restrictions on Chinese diplomatic representative institutions and news and business institutions, stop all provocations and threats; otherwise, all consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the British government.

Vice Minister Luo Guibo finally solemnly announced that the Chinese government has decided: first, from now on, all personnel of the British office in China are not allowed to leave Chinese territory without the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs; all exit visas issued to the British office personnel are hereby revoked; second, all personnel of the British office in China are only allowed to move between the office and their residences. If they need to exceed the above activity range, they must apply 48 hours in advance.

    英帝派警察特务向我代办处挑衅并打伤我人员
    我国政府向英政府提出最强烈抗议
    要求立即撤销对我驻英机构的一切无理限制，停止一切挑衅威胁，防止暴行再度发生
    严正宣布我对英国驻华代办处采取的两项措施
    新华社三十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部副部长罗贵波今日凌晨紧急召见英国驻华代办霍普森，就英国政府连续派出大批警察和特务对我驻英代办处等机构进行种种挑衅、指使警察和暴徒殴打我代办处工作人员的野蛮暴行，提出最紧急、最严重、最强烈的抗议，并且宣布了中国政府对英国驻华代办处采取的两项措施。
    罗贵波副部长指出：连日来，英国政府连续派出大批警察和便衣特务，包围中国驻英代办处及其所属商务机构、新华社伦敦分社和中国银行伦敦分行，进行种种挑衅。八月二十九日上午，英国政府又唆使暴徒殴打我代办处工作人员；同日下午，英国政府竟变本加厉地指使警察和暴徒再次寻衅，英国警察公然手持警棍，野蛮殴打我代办处工作人员。据初步消息，我代办处工作人员被英国警察毒打重伤三人，轻伤十余人。中国政府对英国政府这种野蛮暴行提出最紧急、最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    罗贵波说，中国政府要求英国政府立即采取有效措施，防止暴行事件再度发生，为受伤者提供医疗条件，切实保证中国驻英外交代表机构和新闻、商务机构以及上述各机构全体人员的安全，并且惩办凶手，赔偿损失。中国政府保留进一步提出要求的权利。
    罗贵波副部长说，必须指出，上述事件的发生，并不是偶然的。在八月二十二日，英国政府就对中国驻英代办处等机构采取非法措施，无理限制中国驻英国的外交人员和工作人员的离境自由和行动自由，并且企图中断中国驻英代办处的正常外交通讯联系。
    罗贵波说，英国政府这一系列非法措施和野蛮行径是英国政府和香港英国当局疯狂镇压中国同胞的法西斯暴行的继续。中国政府要质问英国政府，你们究竟要把中英两国关系引向何处？
    他指出，英国政府必须立即撤销对中国外交代表机构和新闻、商务机构的一切无理限制措施，停止一切挑衅和威胁，否则，由此引起的一切后果，必须由英国政府承担。
    罗贵波副部长最后严正宣布，中国政府现在决定：一、自即日起，英国驻华代办处全体人员，未经中国外交部准许，不得离开中国国境；原已发给英国代办处人员的出境签证一律作废；二、英国驻华代办处全体人员只准在代办处办公处所和寓所之间活动，如要超过上述活动范围，必须在四十八小时前提出申请。
