Four years ago today, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the statement "Support the American Blacks' Just Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination."

In this historically significant statement, Chairman Mao condemned the U.S. reactionary ruling clique's racial discrimination and oppression of blacks, exposed the intrinsic connection between the U.S. government's domestic reactionary policies and its aggressive policies abroad, and argued the revolutionary truth that the racial question is fundamentally a class question. He analyzed the development of the American black movement and enthusiastically supported the American blacks' just struggle.

Chairman Mao stated in the declaration: "I call upon the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, enlightened bourgeois elements, and other enlightened people of all races—white, black, yellow, and brown—in the world to unite and oppose U.S. imperialism's racial discrimination, and support the American blacks' struggle against racial discrimination."

Chairman Mao's statement is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism, providing powerful ideological and theoretical weapons for the revolutionary struggle of American blacks.

Chairman Mao's statement is a beacon of light, illuminating the path to liberation for American blacks and all oppressed peoples.

Chairman Mao's statement is a great call to battle, providing immense encouragement to the struggling American blacks and revolutionary people all over the world.

Over the past four years, American blacks have become increasingly aware, and their resistance has grown stronger. Their struggle has spread from local regions to the entire United States, from bare-handed protests to armed resistance, using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. Especially this summer, the armed resistance in Newark and Detroit quickly spread to over ninety cities. The ferocity and scale of this uprising are unprecedented in American history. The Johnson administration, deploying tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and helicopters to suppress the black armed resistance, has shown a level of panic never before seen in American history.

Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "The rapid development of the American blacks' struggle is a manifestation of the increasingly sharpened class struggle and national struggle within the United States."

The rise of the American blacks' armed resistance is the result of the U.S. ruling clique's long-term brutal exploitation, discrimination, and persecution of blacks, and the result of the U.S. ruling clique's intensified policy of aggression and war abroad and fascism at home. American blacks have always lived at the bottom of society, suffering from both class and national oppression. The vast majority of blacks have been deprived of their voting rights. Their wages are the lowest, and their unemployment rate is the highest. They are often subjected to arbitrary arrest, torture, and murder. The U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam has deepened the misery of American blacks. The Johnson administration first used blacks as cannon fodder; one-fourth of those conscripted nationwide are black. Countless facts prove that the evil imperialist system and the brutal rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique are the root causes of the blacks' deep suffering.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue." This is an important principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Recognizing this important principle is of great significance for American blacks and all oppressed nations and peoples in the world who are fighting for their own liberation, in distinguishing between friends and enemies, determining the direction of struggle, and formulating correct strategies and tactics.

American capitalism and imperialism have developed on the basis of ruthlessly exploiting blacks. The U.S. system of racial discrimination has always been a form of class oppression. The U.S. ruling clique has pushed racial discrimination to its extreme in order to strengthen class exploitation and oppression. They not only use this barbaric system to extract tens of billions of dollars in surplus profits from blacks each year but also use blacks as a vast reserve army of labor to drive oppressed whites to endure the exploitation and enslavement of monopoly capital. At the same time, they use this system to create racial prejudice and hatred among laborers of different skin colors, to divide and rule, and to undermine the unity and struggle of the American working class and laboring people, in order to maintain the reactionary rule of monopoly capital.

Chairman Mao points out: "In the United States, it is only the reactionary ruling clique among the white race that oppresses blacks. They absolutely cannot represent the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened people who make up the vast majority of the white race."

The lines of revolution and counter-revolution have never been drawn based on skin color or race but rather on class and political boundaries.

A small clique of U.S. reactionary rulers is not only the exploiter and oppressor of American blacks but also the exploiter and oppressor of the laboring people of the white race. The interests of American blacks and the broad masses of the white laboring people are one and the same, and they are fundamentally opposed to the U.S. reactionary ruling clique. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique is the common enemy of the broad masses of people of all races in the United States.

Fundamentally, national oppression arises with the existence of classes and class oppression. To completely eliminate national oppression, it is necessary to eliminate class oppression, overthrow the reactionary rule of monopoly capital, and overthrow the imperialist system. Under the imperialist system, American blacks cannot achieve complete liberation on their own. The complete liberation of American blacks can only be achieved when the working class of different skin colors in the United States unites, and when the working class and all oppressed nations and peoples of the world unite to eliminate U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Mao says: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." The liberation of American blacks and the American people must also follow this path. The broad masses of American blacks have seen through the deceptions of the U.S. ruling clique's so-called "Civil Rights Act" and other tricks, have broken through the dam of so-called "non-violence," and have launched a violent struggle. This is a major development in the American black movement. The armed resistance of American blacks has played a great vanguard role in the revolutionary struggle of the American people.

The Soviet revisionist clique and the American revisionist elements of the Communist Party, as running dogs of the U.S. monopoly capital, madly slander and oppose the armed resistance of blacks. Under the pretext of "unity between blacks and whites," they attempt to control the black struggle and bring the black struggle within the bounds allowed by U.S. monopoly capital. This gang of running dogs of U.S. monopoly capital are traitors to American blacks and traitors to all laboring people in the United States.

Chairman Mao points out: "At present, the oppressors, aggressors, and threats to the absolute majority of nations and peoples in the world are a small clique of imperialists headed by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries who support them. They are the minority, and we are the majority."

The armed resistance of American blacks is a force rich in fighting spirit in the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism. American blacks' rebellion in the heart of U.S. imperialism powerfully supports the anti-U.S. struggle of the peoples of various countries. The struggle of American blacks has also received the support of the people of the world. Seven hundred million Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of American blacks.

The U.S. reactionary ruling clique appears to be a formidable force, but in reality, it is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It has already been surrounded by the people of the world in its foreign adventures and faces increasingly strong opposition from the American people at home. Its days are numbered. With the support of more than 90% of the people of the world, the just struggle of American blacks is bound to triumph.

Chairman Mao points out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which prospered with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." Chairman Mao's great prophecy will surely become a shining reality!

    美国黑人的正义斗争一定要胜利
    ——纪念毛主席《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》发表四周年
    四年前的今天，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》。
    在这个具有历史意义的声明中，毛主席谴责了美国反动统治集团对黑人的种族歧视和压迫，揭露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。毛主席论证了种族问题实质上是阶级问题这个革命的真理，分析了美国黑人运动的发展，热烈地支持了美国黑人的正义斗争。
    毛主席在这个声明中说：“我呼吁，全世界白色、黑色、黄色、棕色等各色人种中的工人、农民、革命的知识分子、开明的资产阶级分子和其他开明人士联合起来，反对美国帝国主义的种族歧视，支持美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争。”
    毛主席的声明，是一篇马克思列宁主义的光辉文献，它给美国黑人的革命斗争提供了强大的思想和理论武器。
    毛主席的声明，是一盏光焰无际的明灯，它为美国黑人和一切被压迫人民指出了解放的道路。
    毛主席的声明，是一个伟大的战斗号召，它给斗争中的美国黑人和全世界革命人民以不可估量的巨大鼓舞。
    四年来，美国黑人进一步觉醒，他们的反抗越来越强烈。他们的斗争，从局部地区发展到席卷全美国，从赤手空拳发展到拿起武器，用革命的暴力对付反革命的暴力。特别是今年夏天，从纽瓦克和底特律爆发的黑人武装抗暴斗争，几天之间就扩展到九十多个城市。其来势之猛，规模之大，为美国历史上前所未见。而约翰逊政府，调遣几万军队，出动坦克和直升飞机，来镇压黑人武装抗暴斗争，这样惊慌失措，也是美国历史上从来没有的现象。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“美国黑人斗争的迅速发展是美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现”。
    美国黑人武装抗暴斗争的兴起，是美国统治集团对黑人长期实行残酷的剥削、歧视和迫害的结果，是美国统治集团在国外加紧推行侵略和战争政策、在国内加紧推行法西斯政策的结果。美国黑人一直生活在社会的最底层，遭受阶级的和民族的双重压迫。绝大部分黑人被剥夺了选举权。他们的工资最低，失业比率最高。他们经常遭到任意逮捕、拷打和残杀。美帝国主义进行的侵越战争，更加深了美国黑人的灾难。约翰逊政府首先把黑人当作炮灰，全国被征入伍的，有四分之一是黑人。无数的事实证明，万恶的帝国主义制度，美国垄断资本集团的残暴统治，乃是黑人苦难深重的总根源。
    毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”这是一条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的重要原理。认识这一条重要原理，对于为自身的解放而斗争的美国黑人以及世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，划清敌友的界限，确定斗争的方向，制定正确的战略策略，有着极其重要的意义。
    美国的资本主义和帝国主义，本来就是在残酷剥削黑人的基础上发展起来的。美国的种族歧视制度，从来就是阶级压迫的一种形式。美国统治集团把种族歧视制度发展到登峰造极的地步，完全是为了加强阶级剥削和阶级压迫。他们不仅利用这种野蛮的制度，在黑人身上每年榨取几十亿美元的超额利润，而且把黑人作为广大的劳动后备军，来驱使被压迫的白人忍受垄断资本的剥削和奴役。同时，他们利用这种制度在不同肤色的劳动人民之间制造种族偏见和仇恨，实行分而治之，破坏美国工人阶级和劳动人民的团结斗争，以便于维护垄断资本的反动统治。
    毛主席指出：“在美国压迫黑人的，只是白色人种中的反动统治集团。他们绝不能代表白色人种中占绝大多数的工人、农民、革命的知识分子和其他开明人士。”
    革命和反革命的阵线，从来不是以肤色人种来划分的，而是以阶级和政治界限来划分的。
    一小撮美国反动统治集团，不仅是美国黑人的剥削者和压迫者，也是美国白色人种的劳动人民的剥削者和压迫者。美国黑人和广大的白色人种的劳动人民的利益是一致的，而同美国反动统治集团处于根本对立的地位。美国反动统治集团，是美国各色人种的广大人民的共同敌人。
    从根本上说，民族压迫是随着阶级和阶级压迫的存在而产生的。要彻底消灭民族压迫，就必须消灭阶级压迫，推翻垄断资本的反动统治，推翻帝国主义制度。在帝国主义制度之下，美国黑人不可能单独得到彻底解放。美国黑人的彻底解放，只有在不同肤色的美国无产阶级联合起来，全世界无产阶级和一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民联合起来，消灭美国帝国主义，才能够完全实现。
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”美国黑人和美国人民的解放，也一定要走这条道路。广大的美国黑人识破了美国统治集团玩弄的所谓“民权法”之类的骗局，冲破了所谓“非暴力主义”的堤坝，展开了暴力斗争。这是美国黑人运动的重大发展。美国黑人的武装抗暴斗争，在美国人民革命斗争中起了突击队的伟大作用。
    苏修集团在美国的走卒美共修正主义分子，疯狂诬蔑和反对黑人的武装抗暴斗争。他们打着黑人与白人“团结”的幌子，企图控制黑人斗争，把黑人斗争纳入美国垄断资本所能容许的轨道。这一伙美国垄断资本的走狗，是美国黑人的叛徒，也是美国所有的劳动人民的叛徒。
    毛主席指出：“目前，压迫、侵略和威胁全世界绝大多数民族和人民的，是以美国为首的一小撮帝国主义者和支持他们的各国反动派。他们是少数，我们是多数。”
    美国黑人的武装抗暴斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的一支富有战斗精神的力量。美国黑人在美帝国主义心脏里面造反，有力地支援了世界各国人民的反美斗争。美国黑人的斗争也得到了全世界人民的支援。七亿中国人民坚决站在美国黑人一边。
    美国反动统治集团，看上去是个庞然大物，其实不过是个外强中干的纸老虎。它在国外已经陷入了全世界人民的重重包围之中，在国内也遭到美国人民日益强烈的反对。它的寿命不会很长了。在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。
    毛主席指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛主席的这个伟大的预言必将变为光辉的现实！
