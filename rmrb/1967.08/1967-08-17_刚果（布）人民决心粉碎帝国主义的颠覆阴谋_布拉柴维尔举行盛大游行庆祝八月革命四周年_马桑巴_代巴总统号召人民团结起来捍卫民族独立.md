The people of Congo (Brazzaville) are determined to foil the imperialist sabotage plots. A grand parade was held in Brazzaville to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the August Revolution, enthusiastically hailing the victories achieved by the Congolese people in their struggle against imperialist sabotage and in defense of national independence.

President Alphonse Massamba-Débat, Prime Minister Ambroise Noumazalaye, National Assembly President Paul Mouyabi, and members of the Political Bureau of the National Revolutionary Movement, as well as government ministers, reviewed the parade.

Before the parade began, President Massamba-Débat delivered a speech. He called on the Congolese people to unite and defend national independence.

During the parade, Congolese youth carried large banners reading, "We youth condemn American imperialism!" They were warmly welcomed.

The militia, born and grown in the struggle against imperialist sabotage, marched past the reviewing stand with guns in hand. The crowd cheered, "Long live the Congolese revolution!"

A militia leader said, "We must stay vigilant and protect the fruits of the Congolese revolution."

According to a report from Brazzaville, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) are vigilant against the sabotage plots of imperialism and domestic and foreign reactionaries as they celebrate the fourth anniversary of the August Revolution. They remember the teachings of the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make a final struggle. ... We must not relax our vigilance." They are confidently preparing to smash any new acts of aggression, sabotage, and provocation by imperialism and its lackeys.

Imperialism, led by the United States, and its lackeys are scheming to sabotage the struggle of the Congolese people to maintain national independence. The U.S.-backed Mobutu in Congo (Kinshasa) is working hard for his master, recruiting Yulu elements who fled from Congo (Brazzaville) and training them militarily. These outlaws, shunned by the Congolese people, are fed by dollars and armed with American weapons, waiting for the opportunity to sneak across the Congo River to carry out sabotage and destruction in Congo (Brazzaville). Just last July, a group of armed bandits from Congo (Kinshasa) infiltrated Brazzaville to loot and commit violence. However, these bandits were punished by the vigilant people of Congo (Brazzaville) and were captured on the spot. According to Congolese publications, among the plotters were some from important religious centers in imperialist countries and some who had put on priestly robes again. They came to Brazzaville after conspiring in some countries in Central Africa. Under the cover of religion, they spied everywhere and carried out espionage activities without restraint.

Imperialism also uses its diplomatic missions in Congo (Brazzaville) to collude with domestic reactionaries, steal state secrets of Congo (Brazzaville), distribute reactionary leaflets, and incite conflicts between tribes and regions.

However, in the face of the mobilized and organized people of Congo (Brazzaville), the plots of imperialism and its lackeys have repeatedly met with shameful failure. The militia of Congo (Brazzaville), born and grown in the struggle, has made indelible contributions to defending and consolidating the national independence of Congo (Brazzaville).

A militia leader, speaking of past struggles, quoted Mao Zedong: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are utterly destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The leader said with boundless respect, "The great truth revealed by Chairman Mao has been repeatedly proven in Congo (Brazzaville). The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to victory in the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people."

    布拉柴维尔举行盛大游行庆祝八月革命四周年
    马桑巴—代巴总统号召人民团结起来捍卫民族独立
    新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电　刚果（布）首都布拉柴维尔十五日举行盛大的游行，庆祝刚果（布）八月革命四周年，热烈欢呼刚果人民在反对帝国主义的颠覆阴谋和维护民族独立的斗争中所取得的胜利。
    刚果（布）总统马桑巴—代巴、总理努马扎莱、国民议会议长穆亚比以及全国革命运动政治局委员们、政府部长们检阅了游行队伍。
    游行开始以前，马桑巴—代巴总统讲了话。他号召刚果人民团结起来，捍卫民族独立。
    游行时，刚果青年抬着的巨大的标语牌上写着：“我们青年谴责美帝国主义！”他们受到热烈的欢迎。
    在反击帝国主义颠覆活动的斗争中诞生、成长的民卫团的队伍手持枪支威武地走过检阅台。这时，群众欢呼：“刚果革命万岁！”
    民卫团的一位负责人说，我们要提高警惕，保卫刚果革命的成果。
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电　刚果（布）人民在庆祝八月革命四周年的时候，警惕地戒备着帝国主义和国内外反动派的颠覆阴谋。他们牢记着伟大的革命导师毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。……我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”他们满怀信心地准备粉碎帝国主义及其走狗的任何新的侵略、破坏和挑衅行动。
    以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗处心积虑地破坏刚果（布）人民为维护民族独立而进行的斗争。美国豢养的走狗蒙博托在刚果（金）竭力为他的主子效劳，搜罗从刚果（布）逃亡的尤卢分子，对他们进行军事训练。这些被刚果（布）人民唾弃了的亡命之徒，在美元的喂养下，拿着美制武器，伺机偷渡刚果河，对刚果（布）进行颠覆和破坏活动。就在今年七月的一个周末，一股来自刚果（金）的武装匪徒钻进布拉柴维尔市抢劫和行凶。但是，这些匪徒们遭到保持着高度警惕的刚果（布）人民的惩罚，当场被捕。据刚果（布）报刊揭露，策划阴谋的人当中，有的是来自帝国主义国家重要的宗教中心和一些重新穿上教袍的“教士”，他们在中非一些国家经过密谋策划后来到了布拉柴维尔。他们披着宗教外衣，到处刺探情报，肆无忌惮地进行间谍活动。
    帝国主义还利用他们在刚果（布）设立的外交机构同刚果（布）国内的反动派相勾结，盗窃刚果（布）国家机密情报，散发反动传单，挑拨各部族、地区之间的关系。
    但是，在动员和组织起来的刚果（布）人民面前，帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋一再遭到可耻的失败。在斗争中诞生和成长的刚果（布）民卫团为保卫和巩固刚果（布）民族独立立下了不可磨灭的功勋。
    民卫团一位负责人在谈到过去斗争的体会时，引用毛主席的话说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”这位负责人以无限崇敬的心情说：“毛主席揭示的这一伟大真理在刚果（布）得到多次的证实。毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了刚果（布）人民革命斗争胜利的道路。”
