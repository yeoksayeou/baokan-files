Fearless Red Diplomats Armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Our Staff at the Chinese Embassy in England Bravely Defend Themselves Against British Hooligans

The British government deliberately created a serious bloody incident, brazenly deploying a large number of police, spies, and hooligans to attack our embassy in England twice, injuring many of our staff members, and adding another debt of blood to the Chinese people!

New China News Agency, London, August 29th—The British imperialists, who are currently in a frenzy of anti-China activities, brazenly deployed a large number of police, spies, and hooligans to attack the Chinese Embassy in England twice on the 29th, brutally injuring many of our embassy staff. This is a serious bloody incident deliberately created by the British government with planning and organization, and another debt of blood owed to the Chinese people.

The British imperialists, ignoring repeated warnings from the Chinese government and the Chinese people, as well as strong condemnations from revolutionary people around the world, have been brutally suppressing our compatriots in Hong Kong. Recently, they have also heartlessly taken a series of illegal measures and barbaric actions against our embassy in England and other news and business institutions. In recent days, the British authorities, in addition to unreasonably restricting the freedom of movement and communication of Chinese diplomatic and staff members in the UK and attempting to cut off normal diplomatic communications with the Chinese Embassy in England, have also dispatched large numbers of police and spies to surround our embassy in England and other institutions day and night, and have been constantly provoking our staff members in various unreasonable ways. On the morning and noon of the 29th, the British authorities even deployed more than a hundred police officers armed with batons in front of our embassy, brutally beating our diplomatic staff, resulting in three of our staff members suffering serious head injuries and many others injured. The three seriously injured comrades, Yu Shenzhi, Li Dianchang, and Li Huitang, have been sent to the hospital for examination and treatment.

This serious incident was entirely orchestrated by the British authorities. At 11 AM on the 29th, the British police and spies surrounding our embassy in England unreasonably interrogated and searched a British progressive who was carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to express support for the just struggle of the Chinese people, and forcibly took him away. Our embassy staff immediately went out the door to severely expose and condemn the fascist actions of the British police. At this moment, a group of hooligans immediately swarmed up, provoking and attacking our embassy staff, first striking our staff members, and the police on the scene also joined the hooligans in beating, injuring many of our staff members.

At 12:30 PM that day, a large number of British police and spies deliberately created an even more serious bloody incident at the gate of our embassy's garage. At that time, an undercover spy deliberately wore a Mao Zedong badge upside down in front of our embassy staff to provoke us. Our embassy staff immediately lodged a serious protest and warning with him and demanded an apology. Just as our embassy staff were reasoning with the British police and spies, dozens of British police armed with batons rushed up and brutally beat our embassy staff. Many comrades were beaten to the ground, bloodied, with embassy driver Yu Shenzhi having his head beaten open, suffering a serious injury. Our embassy staff member Li Dianchang was pinned to the ground and brutally beaten by several police officers, suffering serious injuries to his head and lower jaw. Embassy staff members Li Huitang and Wang Zhenpu were also beaten and injured. At that time, other embassy staff members present were also beaten by the police, with many injured.

Under the brutal attack of the British police and spies, our embassy staff bravely defended themselves and fought back.

During the intervals between the two attacks by British police and hooligans, our embassy staff raised the five-star red flag at the door, held up the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," loudly recited quotations from Chairman Mao, sang revolutionary songs, and exposed the fascist atrocities of the British police to passersby.

Our embassy staff, in the face of the British authorities' fascist atrocities, were full of fighting spirit and fully demonstrated the fearless heroism of red diplomats armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Some passersby who witnessed the event were also moved by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese diplomats, with some shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" on the spot.

After the incident, many British friends and friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the UK called and wrote to the Chinese Embassy in England and the New China News Agency London Branch, strongly condemning the British authorities' fascist atrocities and expressing enthusiastic support for the brave struggle of the Chinese embassy staff.

Chinese Embassy in England Acting Charge d'Affaires Shen Ping immediately telephoned the British Foreign Office to lodge the strongest and most urgent protest after the incident, demanding that the British side: 1. Immediately stop all anti-China atrocities and punish the culprits; 2. Guarantee the safety of the staff of the Chinese Embassy in England and other institutions; 3. Immediately provide appropriate treatment for the seriously injured Chinese personnel in the incident; 4. Immediately dispatch responsible officials from the British Foreign Office to jointly investigate the injuries with our embassy representatives, and reserve the right to make further demands. Before this, Shen Ping had lodged the strongest protests to the British authorities from the 22nd to the 29th regarding the series of illegal measures and barbaric actions taken by the British government against our embassy in England and other institutions.

During the police attack, our red diplomats raised the five-star red flag at the embassy door, held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stood on the balcony shouting slogans, and exposed the fascist atrocities of the British police.

    毛泽东思想武装的红色外交战士大无畏！
    我驻英代办处人员英勇自卫反击英国暴徒
    英国政府蓄意制造严重流血事件，悍然出动大批警察、特务、暴徒两次袭击我驻英代办处，并打伤我工作人员多人，对中国人民欠下又一笔血债！
    新华社伦敦二十九日电　正在疯狂反华的英帝国主义，二十九日悍然出动大批警察、特务、暴徒两次袭击中国驻英代办处并野蛮打伤我代办处工作人员多人。这是英国政府有计划有组织地制造出来的严重流血事件，是它对中国人民欠下的又一笔血债。
    英帝国主义无视中国政府和中国人民的一再警告以及世界革命人民的强烈谴责，在疯狂镇压我香港同胞的同时，最近又丧心病狂地对我驻英代办处以及新闻、商务等机构采取了一系列非法措施和野蛮暴行。连日来，英国当局除了无理限制中国驻英国的外交人员和工作人员的离境自由和行动自由、并企图中断中国驻英代办处的正常外交通讯联系外，他们还派出大批警察和特务昼夜包围我驻英代办处和驻英其他机构，并不断对我工作人员进行各种无理挑衅。二十九日上午和中午，英国当局竟出动一百多名手执警棍的警察在我代办处门前野蛮殴打我外交人员，使我工作人员三人头部受重伤，其他多人受伤。受重伤的三位同志于慎之、李殿昌、李惠堂已送医院检查治疗。
    这一严重事件完全是英国当局一手蓄意制造的。二十九日上午十一时，包围我驻英代办处的英国警察和特务对一位手拿《毛主席语录》前往我代办处表示支持中国人民正义斗争的英国进步人士进行无理盘问和搜查，并将他强行带走。我代办处人员当即走出门外，严厉揭发和谴责英国警察的法西斯行径。这时，一批暴徒立即蜂拥而上，对我代办处工作人员进行挑衅和袭击，首先动手殴打我工作人员，在场的警察也同暴徒一起殴打，打伤我工作人员多人。
    当天中午十二时半，大批英国警察特务又有计划地在我代办处汽车库门口制造了更加严重的流血事件。当时，一名便衣特务在我代办处工作人员面前故意将毛主席像章颠倒佩戴向我挑衅，我代办处工作人员当即向他提出严重抗议和警告，并要他赔礼道歉。正当我代办处工作人员同英国警察特务进行说理斗争时，数十名手执警棍的英国警察一拥而上，野蛮地殴打我代办处工作人员，许多同志被打倒在地，血流满面，代办处司机于慎之同志头部被打破，伤势十分严重。我代办处工作人员李殿昌被数名警察按倒在地，蛮横殴打，头部和下额受重伤。代办处工作人员李惠堂、王振谱也被警察殴打受重伤。当时在场的我代办处其他工作人员也遭警察毒打，多人受伤。
    在英国警察特务的野蛮袭击下，我代办处人员进行了英勇的自卫反击。
    在两次英国警察和暴徒袭击的间隙期间，我代办处工作人员在门前升起了五星红旗，高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像和红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗诵毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲，并向过往行人揭露英国警察的法西斯暴行。
    我代办处工作人员在英国当局的法西斯暴行面前，斗志昂扬，充分表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色外交战士的大无畏的英雄气概。一些目睹这一事件的行人也为中国外交人员的这种革命精神所感动，有人当场就高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    事后，许多英国朋友和在英国的亚、非、拉各国朋友纷纷打电话、写信给中国驻英代办处和新华社伦敦分社，强烈谴责英国当局的法西斯暴行并表示热情支持中国驻英工作人员的英勇斗争。
    中国驻英国代办处临时代办沈平在事件发生后立即用电话向英国外交部提出最紧急最强烈的抗议，并要求英方：一、立即停止一切反华暴行，惩办凶犯；二、保证中国驻英代办处和其他机构人员的安全；三、保证对在事件中受重伤的中国人员立即给予应有的治疗；四、立即由英国外交部派负责人员与我代办处代表共同调查伤势，并保留进一步提出要求的一切权利。在这之前，沈平从二十二日到二十九日多次就英国政府对我驻英代办处及其它机构所采取的一系列非法措施和野蛮行径向英国当局提出过最强烈的抗议。（附图片）
