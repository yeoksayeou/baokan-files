Albanian newspaper denounces Tito's visit to the Arab world as a tool of American imperialism

Tito is selling a new package of American and Soviet goods

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 24th, the Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published a commentary on the 24th pointing out that the purpose of the visit to the Arab world by Tito, the faithful lackey of American imperialism and the leader of the Yugoslav revisionist clique, is to help American imperialists get out of their predicament, deceive and split anti-imperialist forces, and realize the enslavement plan of the new colonialists across the Atlantic.

The commentary said that after the Glassboro meeting between Johnson and Kosygin, the Budapest meeting was immediately convened to carry out the new conspiracy of the Soviet and American against the Arab people. Tito participated in this meeting and visited the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Iraq under these circumstances.

The commentary pointed out that Tito's "Middle East peace plan" actually strengthens the position of the Israeli Zionists, while also providing an outlet for the Soviet and American to pressure Arab countries through the United Nations. Tito's proposal is not a new product, but a new package of Soviet and American goods.

The commentary said that to maintain and strengthen national independence, Arab countries cannot expect imperialists and Zionists to do anything good, nor can they expect Soviet revisionists, Tito revisionists, and the United Nations controlled by the Soviet and American to do anything good. The basis and guarantee for the people of a country to achieve victory in any activity is self-reliance. Only by adhering to the policy of self-reliance, further strengthening the unity of Arab countries, and striving for the help and support of all freedom-loving and anti-imperialist forces in the world, can the Arab people foil the new conspiracy of the imperialists and revisionists against the Arabs.

    阿报谴责美帝走狗铁托的阿拉伯之行
    铁托兜售的是美苏货色的新装潢
    据新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十四日发表评论指出，美帝国主义的忠实走狗、南斯拉夫修正主义集团头目铁托的阿拉伯之行的目的在于帮助美帝国主义者摆脱困境，欺骗和分裂反帝力量，实现大西洋彼岸的新殖民主义者的奴役计划。
    评论说，在约翰逊—柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会晤以后立即召开的布达佩斯会议，目的在于执行苏美反对阿拉伯人民的新阴谋。铁托参加了这次会议，并在这种情况下访问阿联、叙利亚和伊拉克。
    评论在谈到铁托兜售的“中近东和平方案”时指出，这个方案事实上加强以色列犹太复国主义者的地位，同时也为美苏安排了出路，通过联合国对阿拉伯国家施加压力。铁托的建议不是什么新货色，而是美苏货色的新装潢。
    评论说，为了维护和加强民族独立，阿拉伯国家既不能希望帝国主义者和犹太复国主义者干什么好事，也不能希望苏联修正主义者、铁托修正主义者以及美苏操纵的联合国干什么好事。一个国家的人民在任何活动中取得胜利的基础和保证是自力更生。阿拉伯人民只有坚持自力更生方针、进一步加强阿拉伯国家的团结，争取世界上所有爱好自由和反帝力量的帮助和支持，才能粉碎帝修反对阿拉伯的新阴谋。
