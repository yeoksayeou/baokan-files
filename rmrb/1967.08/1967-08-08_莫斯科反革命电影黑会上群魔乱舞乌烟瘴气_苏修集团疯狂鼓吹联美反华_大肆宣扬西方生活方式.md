The so-called Fifth Moscow International Film Festival, organized by the Soviet revisionists in collusion with American imperialism, has recently concluded. This was a reactionary film festival where the Soviet revisionists actively promoted an alliance with the U.S. against China, advocated bourgeois humanitarianism and pacifism, propagated the decadent Western lifestyle, and pushed for a full-scale restoration of capitalism.

The Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin personally adorned the "film festival." In his congratulatory message, he ranted about the mission of film art being to "establish a worldview based on modern advanced thought," that the "Moscow International Film Festival is a grand demonstration of modern film art achievements," and that it "aids in the development of cultural exchanges among nations," and so on.

What exactly are the "modern advanced thought," "modern film art achievements," and "cultural exchanges" that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is promoting? A simple dissection of the films that were highly praised and awarded at the festival reveals all.

This film festival ran from July 5 to July 20. In the end, the feature film jury awarded the two top prizes (the most important awards of the entire festival) to the Soviet film "The Journalist" and the Hungarian film "Father."

The film "The Journalist" is a product of the Soviet film industry boss Grashimov, who also directed and starred in it. It is a poisonous weed that madly advocates for an alliance with the U.S. against China. The film depicts a Soviet journalist sent to Switzerland and France as a reporter, where he befriends an American journalist who serves as a tool of American imperialism. The two become thick as thieves, sharing secrets and almost inseparable. Through the mouth of the American journalist, the film vigorously promotes the fallacy of the Soviet revisionist leadership, urging people of all countries to lay down their arms and surrender to imperialism to build a new peaceful world. The "reports" of this American journalist once displeased American businessmen, who surrounded him in a tavern and even tried to beat him up. At this point, the Soviet journalist steps in to rescue the American journalist from the businessmen's encirclement. The American journalist also takes the Soviet journalist on various outings, together they visit Paris nightclubs, watch stripteases until late at night. The film spends a long time depicting the decadent and corrupt nightlife of Paris, which is shameless to the extreme.

Even more outrageous is that in another scene, an elderly Soviet journalist played by Grashimov, in a conversation with a French actress in Paris, openly curses the Red Guards of China. In the film script Grashimov published two years ago, there were no specific anti-China words, but now, to adapt to the further crazed anti-China and anti-Chinese Cultural Revolution stance of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the script has added a dialogue attacking the Chinese Red Guards.

Obviously, the political content of advocating for an alliance with the U.S. against China is the true reason why the Soviet film "The Journalist" received the "grand prize."

The Hungarian film "Father," which also received a "grand prize," is a vicious film that madly opposes Stalin, Marxism-Leninism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The film maliciously portrays the 1956 Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, showing how the counter-revolutionaries smashed the red stars symbolizing the proletarian dictatorship to pieces and how the "residents" destroyed Stalin's statues, etc. This film, created according to the political program of modern revisionism, is a thoroughly reactionary piece of trash. In addition, the low-level and vulgar Bulgarian film "Distance" and the Czechoslovakian film "Little Trumpet Romance" received the "Special Gold Medal" and "Special Silver Medal," respectively. The Polish film "Westpreussen," which praises capitulationism, received the "Silver Medal." The film "Little Fugitive," co-produced by the Soviet Union and Japan to promote "Soviet-Japanese cooperation," received the "Gold Medal" for children's films.

At this "film festival," the Soviet revisionists showed a fervent desire to pursue "full cooperation with the U.S." They invited several dozen Americans to Moscow to participate in the "film festival" on a special plane, which was the largest American film delegation ever sent. When the first American feature film participating in the competition was screened in the "Congress Hall" of the Kremlin, the Soviet revisionists specially arranged for the American delegation to come on stage and meet the audience. At that time, several film cameras were aimed at these "guests of honor," and the hall was filled with a "warm atmosphere" that had never been seen during the screening of any other country's films. On the same evening, the American film delegation held a "grand banquet" for 700 people at the newly built largest "Russia" hotel in Moscow, inviting Soviet "cultural celebrities." The Soviet leadership allowed the Americans to screen a total of twelve films at this "film festival," including seven American feature films, three children's films, and two documentary shorts. In the end, they awarded the Americans one "Best Actress Award," one "Silver Medal" for children's films, and one "Honorary Certificate" for directors. Whether from the reflection of the relationship between the Soviet Union and the American journalist in the Soviet film "The Journalist," or from the attitude of the Soviet revisionists towards the American "guests of honor" during the "film festival," it can be seen that the Soviet revisionists have completely bowed down to American imperialism and are willing to serve as a tame accomplice and servant in the reactionary "holy alliance" with American imperialism as its leader.

The Moscow "International Film Festival" organized by the Soviet revisionists in collusion with American imperialism is another major exposure of the traitorous nature of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique. The facts are clear: Kosygin's so-called "modern advanced thought" is the evil thought of imperialism and modern revisionism serving it. His so-called "modern film art achievements" are the rubbish of imperialism and revisionism that are anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolution. Their so-called "cultural exchanges" are the exchange of reactionary black goods among the Soviet revisionists, American imperialists, and their lackeys. The Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to use these most reactionary, most decadent, and most ugly things to deceive and fool the Soviet and world peoples is in vain.

The great Soviet people will never tolerate the long-term rule of reactionary revisionism and will never allow all the ghosts and demons to occupy the Soviet screen. One day, the call of the second October Revolution will resound across the vast land of the Soviet Union, and a thunderous roar will erupt, and a blazing revolutionary fire will burn, completely destroying the clique of reactionary revisionists and ensuring that they never rise again.

    莫斯科反革命电影黑会上群魔乱舞乌烟瘴气
    苏修集团疯狂鼓吹联美反华　大肆宣扬西方生活方式
    新华社莫斯科五日电　苏修集团勾结美帝国主义举行的所谓第五届莫斯科国际电影节，最近已经收场。这是苏修积极大搞联美反华，鼓吹资产阶级人道主义、和平主义，宣扬腐朽西方生活方式，推行全面复辟资本主义的反革命电影黑会。
    苏修头头柯西金亲自给“电影节”梳妆打扮。他在贺词中叫嚷电影艺术的任务在于“树立人的基于现代先进思想的世界观”，“莫斯科国际电影节是现代电影艺术成就的大示威”，“有助于各国文化交流的发展”等等。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团所鼓吹的“现代先进思想”、“现代电影艺术成就”和“文化交流”等等究竟是什么货色呢？只要解剖一下电影节上被推崇备至并获重奖的“标本”就昭然若揭了。
    这次电影节从七月五日举行到七月二十日。最后，故事片评委会把“电影节”的两个大奖（整个电影节最主要奖）给了苏联影片《记者》和匈牙利影片《父亲》。
    影片《记者》是苏修电影界霸头格拉西莫夫编导和亲自参加演出的，是一部疯狂鼓吹联美反华的大毒草。影片描写一个苏联记者被派到瑞士和法国当记者时，在那里结交了一个作为美帝国主义御用工具的美国记者，此后两人称兄道弟，推心置腹，几乎是形影不离。影片通过美国记者之口竭力宣扬苏修领导集团要各国人民向帝国主义缴械投降的谬论，说什么应当把所有的武器统统扔掉以建立和平的新世界。这个美国记者的“报道”曾引起美国商人的不满，许多美国商人在酒馆中包围了这个美国佬，甚至有人要动手揍他。这时苏联记者出面解围，把美国记者从美国商人的包围中解救出来。美国记者还领着苏联记者到处闲逛，一起逛巴黎的夜总会，看“脱衣舞”直到深夜。影片长时间的渲染糜烂腐朽的巴黎夜生活，无耻之极。
    更为疯狂的是，由格拉西莫夫扮演的另一个苏联老年记者，在巴黎同法国演员的对话中，竟明目张胆地咒骂中国的红卫兵。格拉西莫夫在两年前发表的这个电影脚本中还没有提到什么具体的反华词句，但现在为了适应苏修领导集团进一步疯狂反华、反对中国无产阶级文化大革命的需要，剧本中新加上了攻击中国红卫兵的一段台词。
    很显然，联美反华的政治内容，就是苏修影片《记者》获得“大奖”的真正原因。
    获得“大奖”的匈牙利影片《父亲》是一部疯狂反对斯大林，反对马克思列宁主义，反对无产阶级专政的恶毒影片。影片中别有用心地把一九五六年的匈牙利反革命叛乱事件搬上了银幕，描写反革命分子如何把象征着无产阶级政权的红星砸得粉碎，“居民们”如何把斯大林的塑像毁掉等等。根据现代修正主义的政治纲领炮制出来的这部影片，是彻头彻尾为反革命张目的黑货。此外，低级下流的保加利亚影片《距离》和捷克斯洛伐克影片《小号浪漫曲》，分别获得“特别金质奖”、“特别银质奖”。歌颂投降主义的波兰影片《维斯特普雷特》获得“银质奖”。为鼓吹“苏日合作”，而由苏日合拍的《小逃亡者》获得儿童片“金质奖”。
    在这次“电影节”上，苏修集团表现了一副狂热追求“美苏全面合作”的奴才相。美国应苏修集团的“邀请”，派出了好几十人乘坐专机到莫斯科参加“电影节”，这是美国从来没有派出过的庞大电影代表团。当美国第一部参加比赛的故事片在克里姆林宫的“代表大会堂”上映时，苏修集团特地安排了美国代表团走上舞台同观众见面，当时好几部电影机对准了这些“贵宾”，场内出现了任何一个其它国家影片上映时所不曾出现的“热烈气氛”。同一天晚上，美国电影代表团在莫斯科最新建成的最大的“俄罗斯”旅馆中举行了七百人的“盛大晚宴”，招待苏修的“文化界名流”。苏修领导集团让美国在这次“电影节”上先后放映七部美国故事片，三部儿童片和二部纪录短片，共十二部。最后，授予美国一个“最佳女演员奖”，一个儿童片“银质奖”，一个导演“荣誉奖状”。不论从苏修影片《记者》中反映出来的苏联同美国记者的关系，还是从“电影节”期间苏修对美国“贵宾”的态度，都可以看出，苏修集团已完全拜倒在美帝国主义的脚下，甘心情愿在以美帝国主义为盟主的反革命“神圣同盟”中，充当一名驯服的帮凶和奴仆。
    苏修串通美帝搞的这次莫斯科“国际电影节”，是勃列日涅夫—柯西金之流叛徒面目又一次大暴露。事实非常清楚，柯西金所谓的“现代先进思想”，就是万恶的帝国主义和为它效劳的现代修正主义的思想。他所谓的“现代电影艺术成就”，就是帝国主义和修正主义反华、反共、反人民、反革命的破烂。他们所谓的“文化交流”，就是苏修、美帝及它们的走卒互相交换资产阶级反革命的黑货。苏修领导集团企图以这些最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的东西来欺骗和愚弄苏联及世界人民，是枉费心机的。
    伟大的苏联人民决不会容忍反革命修正主义长期统治下去，决不会允许一切牛鬼蛇神霸占苏联的银幕。总有一天在苏联辽阔的大地上会响起第二次十月革命的号角，会爆发出震天动地的吼声，会燃起熊熊的革命烈火，把苏修领导集团这一撮反革命修正主义分子彻底摧毁，使他们永世不得翻身。
