The revolutionary rebels of the Longgouya Coal Mine, in collaboration with the broad masses of workers, have steadfastly held their production posts since taking power in January this year, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army. They have diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, focused on revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving remarkable results. The entire mine now presents a prosperous scene.

Currently, during the intense struggle to expose and criticize the capitalist roaders within the party and the local power-holders taking the capitalist road, various revolutionary organizations in the mine have basically achieved great unity. Over 80% of the workers and cadres have joined the Red Rebel organization. In the first half of this year, the production plan was exceeded every month. The original coal output completed 105.59% of the state plan, and the total tunneling length also exceeded the plan. All indicators such as labor productivity and profit remittance have significantly increased compared to the same period last year.

The proletarian revolutionary rebels of Longgouya Coal Mine believe that their notable achievements in revolution and production are mainly due to the following experiences: unwaveringly implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production"; insisting on "revolution above ground, production below ground"; insisting on revolution on-site, revolution in spare time, and revolution through thrift; and resolutely not engaging in armed struggle.

Since the Cultural Revolution, the Red Rebels of Longgouya Coal Mine have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings, prioritizing revolution, using revolution to lead production, and driving production forward. The Jingxi Mining Bureau was an important stronghold for the implementation of the revisionist line by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary clique and for the restoration of capitalism. For a long time, the mining bureau and the capitalist roaders within the Longgouya Mine party actively peddled the black goods of the top capitalist roaders within the party, fiercely resisted and opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and used every means to replace class struggle with production struggle, promoting material incentives and bonus systems to corrupt the working class, committing heinous crimes. After the Cultural Revolution began, the Red Rebels of Longgouya Coal Mine firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, directing their attacks at these capitalist roaders within the party, pursuing them relentlessly. Over the past two months, the Red Rebels held more than 30 meetings, exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the capitalist roaders within the mine party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their backers. This struggle further exposed the class struggle between the two classes and the two roads in Longgouya Coal Mine, greatly raising the class consciousness of the worker masses. The Red Rebels were tempered in the struggle for criticism and fighting, and their ranks grew stronger and more numerous.

All these revolutionary activities were conducted during spare time. In the first half of this year, all the large and small criticism and struggle meetings they held, totaling over a hundred, were conducted outside of the eight-hour workday. Sometimes, when they went to Beijing for a meeting, the workers would count that day as their day off. Currently, the Red Rebels have over 1,800 members, and only nine people at all levels in the mine are fully or partially detached from production. Many section, workshop, and branch leaders conduct cultural revolution activities during their spare time. At the beginning of this year, when the Red Rebels just took power, no one was detached from production. Some comrades, after work, didn't even have time to shower, and in their work clothes, they went to the headquarters to stand guard. The Red Rebels have stated that conducting the cultural revolution must not allow production to suffer any losses.

In the first half of this year, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in this mine was exceptionally fierce. The capitalist roaders within the party incited some deceived masses and erring cadres to either debate underground or create obstacles for the Red Rebels during production, or attempted to instigate armed struggle, aiming to achieve their evil goals of disrupting the Cultural Revolution and production. The Red Rebels resolutely exposed and fought against these small groups of troublemakers, using big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions to educate and win over the deceived masses and cadres. All these debates were conducted above ground and during spare time. Above ground, no matter how intense the debates were, as soon as it was time to start work, the Red Rebels would give the order: "We respond to Chairman Mao's call to 'grasp revolution, promote production,' Red Rebels, go down to the mine!" Then everyone would stop debating and go down to the mine to work. Underground, no matter how some deceived masses insulted them, the Red Rebels always focused on production and did not respond. The Red Rebels told the deceived masses: "We are all workers in a socialist country. You are not working for me, and I am not working for you. We are both working for the country. No matter how big our differences are, they cannot affect production." They acted from a broader perspective, actively cooperating with the deceived masses and providing convenient conditions for them during production. When the Red Rebels discovered that the capitalist roaders within the party were creating difficulties during production, they fought back on all fronts while striving to overcome various difficulties and complete and exceed the production tasks.

The Red Rebels of Longgouya Coal Mine understand that the Cultural Revolution is a revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, a great revolution that touches people's souls. The struggle between the two lines and the two ideologies can only be resolved through presenting facts and reasoning, not through armed struggle. Armed struggle will only disrupt the direction of the struggle, affect and destroy production, damage state property, and endanger people's lives and safety. Therefore, the Red Rebels have done everything possible to avoid armed struggle. Since the Cultural Revolution, no matter how intense the class struggle was, and no matter how hard the class enemies tried to incite the masses to fight each other, due to the efforts of the Red Rebels, not a single armed struggle has occurred in Longgouya Coal Mine.

The Red Rebels understand that, being in a position of power, they have a greater responsibility to help the deceived masses and erring cadres clarify their thoughts and raise their consciousness. The attitude of the Red Rebels is: "both urgent and not urgent." "Urgent" means being eager to help and seizing every opportunity to do ideological work. "Not urgent" means giving the deceived masses and erring cadres time to think and time for their consciousness to change. They, together with the People's Liberation Army assigned to support the left, held dozens of meetings with the deceived masses and erring cadres, studied Chairman Mao's works with them, visited them at home, had heart-to-heart talks, and did a great deal of meticulous ideological work. For example, to help a leader of a deceived mass organization return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a main leader of the Red Rebels and a comrade from the People's Liberation Army had several talks with him, recalled hardships and sweet memories together, helped him understand what is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and what is the bourgeois reactionary line, and finally made him realize his mistakes.

Many mid-level and above cadres in Longgouya Coal Mine, to varying degrees, executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, but most of them were promoted from workers and have a relatively deep class sentiment towards the party and Chairman Mao. Whether these erring cadres can be correctly treated is a major issue related to whether the revolution and production in this mine can be well conducted. The People's Liberation Army assigned to support the left in this mine first educated some comrades within the Red Rebels who had revenge sentiments, organizing them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions: "For anyone who makes a mistake, as long as he does not hide his illness and fear treatment, does not stubbornly persist in his mistakes to the point of being incurable, but is sincere and truly wants to be treated and corrected, we should welcome him and cure his illness, making him a good comrade." The Red Rebel and old worker Liu Jintian, who was labeled as a "counter-revolutionary," originally hated the former vice-head of the revolutionary committee who labeled him as a "counter-revolutionary" to death. Later, he learned that with the repeated help of the Red Rebels, this former vice-head of the revolutionary committee had already realized his mistakes and decided to join the revolution. He had several heart-to-heart talks with the former vice-head of the revolutionary committee, firmly supporting him to join the revolution. The Red Rebels implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, while seriously criticizing the mistakes of the cadres, they wholeheartedly helped them join the revolution, supporting them to boldly grasp work and make amends. Now, most of the mid-level and above cadres have stood on the side of the revolutionary faction, examined and corrected their mistakes. One-quarter of the mid-level and above cadres have already been absorbed into the Red Rebels. The section and workshop-level cadres on the production frontline have mostly labored with the workers to solve key and difficult problems in production.

    长沟峪矿革命抓得好生产很出色
    红色造反者团结广大职工坚守生产岗位，坚持不在生产时间搞辩论，坚决不搞武斗，上半年煤炭生产计划月月超额完成。
    据新华社九日讯　京西长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派，自今年一月夺权以后，在人民解放军大力支持和帮助下，努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了显著成绩，整个煤矿出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    目前，这个煤矿在狠揭猛斗党内最大的一小撮和本单位走资本主义道路当权派的大批判大斗争中，各个革命组织已基本上实现了大联合，全矿已有百分之八十以上的职工和干部参加了红色造反者这个革命组织。今年上半年，生产计划月月超额完成，原煤产量完成了国家计划的百分之一百零五点五九，掘进总进尺也超额完成，全员效率、上缴利润等项指标都比去年同期有大幅度增长。
    长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派认为，他们能够在抓革命、促生产方面取得显著成绩，主要经验是：坚定不移地贯彻毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针；坚持“上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产”；坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命；坚决不搞武斗。
    文化大革命以来，长沟峪煤矿的红色造反者始终遵循毛主席的教导，把革命放在第一位，以革命统帅生产，推动生产。京西矿务局是彭真反革命集团推行修正主义路线、进行资本主义复辟的重要据点之一。长期以来，矿务局和长沟峪矿的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，积极贩卖党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的黑货，疯狂抵制和反对毛泽东思想，千方百计用生产斗争代替阶级斗争，推行物质刺激，奖金挂帅，腐蚀工人阶级，犯下了滔天的罪行。文化大革命开展以后，长沟峪煤矿红色造反者一直牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头对准这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，穷追猛打。近两个多月来，红色造反者开了三十多次会议，对本矿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、对彭真反革命修正主义集团和支持他们的总后台进行了有力的揭发、批判和斗争。这场批判斗争，进一步揭开了长沟峪煤矿两个阶级、两条道路斗争的盖子，大大提高了工人群众的阶级觉悟。红色造反者在批判斗争中经受了考验，队伍日益巩固壮大。
    所有这些革命活动，红色造反者都是在业余时间进行的。他们在今年上半年召集的上百次大大小小的批判会、斗争会，全都在八小时工作以外时间进行。有时到北京城里参加大会，工人们就把这一天算作自己轮休的日子。现在，红色造反者有一千八百多名队员，全矿各级脱产半脱产的负责人只有九个。许多工段、车间分部的负责人都是利用业余时间搞文化革命的。今年年初，红色造反者刚夺权的时候，没有人脱产，有些同志下了班来不及洗澡，穿着工作服就到总部值班去了。红色造反者表示，搞文化革命，坚决不能让生产受损失。
    今年上半年，这个矿两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争异常激烈。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，挑动一部分受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部，或在井下搞辩论，或在生产中给红色造反者设置障碍，或企图挑起武斗，以达到他们破坏文化大革命、破坏生产的罪恶目的。红色造反者对制造这一系列阴谋的一小撮坏人，进行了坚决的揭露和斗争，用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论等办法，教育、争取了受蒙蔽的群众和干部。这一系列辩论，都是在井上、在业余时间进行的。在井上，不管辩论多么激烈，但只要一到上班时间，红色造反者一声令下：“咱们响应毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的号召，红色造反者下井罗！”于是，大家就停止辩论，下井生产。在井下，不管一些受蒙蔽的群众怎样辱骂，红色造反者总是埋头生产，决不答辩。红色造反者对受蒙蔽的群众说：“咱们都是社会主义国家的工人，你既不是为我劳动，我也不是为你劳动，咱们都是为国家劳动。我们之间有再大的分歧，也不能影响生产。”他们从大局出发，主动和受蒙蔽群众搞好协作，在生产中为对方提供方便条件。当红色造反者发现党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在生产中进行刁难的时候，一面作针锋相对的斗争，一面鼓足干劲，克服各种困难，努力完成和超额完成生产任务。
    长沟峪煤矿的红色造反者认识到，文化大革命是无产阶级专政条件下的革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。两条路线的斗争，两种思想的斗争，绝不能用武斗的方法，而只有用摆事实、讲道理的方法才能解决。武斗只会干扰斗争大方向，影响和破坏生产，破坏国家财产，危及人民的生命安全。因此红色造反者千方百计避免发生武斗。文化大革命以来，不管阶级斗争多么激烈，阶级敌人千方百计挑动群众斗群众，但由于红色造反者的努力，长沟峪煤矿一次武斗也没有发生过。
    红色造反者认识到，自己处于掌权地位，对待受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部，更加有责任帮助他们弄清思想，提高觉悟。红色造反者的态度是：“又急又不急”。“急”，就是急于帮助，抓紧一切时间做思想工作。“不急”，就是要给受蒙蔽群众和犯错误的干部以思想考虑的时间，认识转变的过程。他们和在这个矿担任支左任务的人民解放军召集受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部开了几十次座谈会，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，上门拜访，促膝谈心，做了大量细致的思想工作。例如，为了帮助一个受蒙蔽群众组织的头头回到毛主席的革命路线上来，红色造反者一个主要负责人和人民解放军同志找他多次谈话，和他一起忆苦思甜，帮助他认清什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线，使他终于认识了自己的错误。
    长沟峪煤矿许多中层以上干部在文化大革命中程度不等地执行了资产阶级反动路线，但他们大部分是由工人提拔起来的，对党对毛主席有比较深厚的阶级感情。能否正确对待这些犯错误的干部，是关系到这个矿革命和生产能否搞好的重大问题。在这个矿担任支左任务的人民解放军，首先教育红色造反者内部少数存在报复情绪的同志，组织他们反复学习毛主席的指示：“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”被打成“反革命”的红色造反者、老工人刘金田，本来对把他打成“反革命”的前文革副主任恨得要命。后来，他得知在红色造反者一再帮助下，这个前文革副主任已经认识到自己的错误，决心起来革命的时候，他同前文革副主任几次谈心，坚决支持他起来革命。红色造反者执行毛主席的干部政策，在严肃批判干部错误的同时，满腔热情地帮助他们起来革命，支持他们大胆地抓工作，将功补过。现在，绝大部分中层以上干部站到了革命派一边，检查并改正自己的错误，四分之一的中层以上干部已经被吸收参加红色造反者。处在生产第一线的段、车间级干部，绝大部分已经同工人一起顶班劳动，解决生产中的关键和疑难问题。
