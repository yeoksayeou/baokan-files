The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang once confessed: “I have always remembered Hu Feng’s… words.”

It is no surprise that a counter-revolutionary revisionist in charge of the literary black line “remembers” the words of the leader of a counter-revolutionary clique. Zhou Yang not only “remembers” Hu Feng’s “words,” but also treats Hu Feng’s words as treasures, using Hu Feng’s same “words” to viciously attack our socialist system and proletarian dictatorship.

Hu Feng said, “In New China, the vast majority of readers are in some kind of organizational life, so they feel like a new bride, always afraid of being beaten, and even a cough is recorded.”

Zhou Yang said: “Proletarian dictatorship is powerful, even more frightening than bourgeois dictatorship! In bourgeois society, … if you are dissatisfied and break the law, you can still run away. Our society is strictly organized, where can you run to? Now there is no place to vent, no place to petition, and even writing in a diary is feared to be discovered.”

Hu Feng said: “Today in China, people do not respect each other…”

Zhou Yang said: “Our society today has the phenomenon of not treating people as people.”

Look, Zhou Yang’s “words” and Hu Feng’s “words” are almost identical, identical, identical!

Zhou Yang said with a ferocious look that the “proletarian dictatorship is frightening,” “powerful,” and “does not treat people as people.”

Zhou Yang and his gang, listen: We are a country of proletarian dictatorship. For the people, we provide full democracy and full freedom; for the enemies, for you counter-revolutionary revisionists, we implement dictatorship. The right to freedom is not given to you, not a bit, not half a bit! You feel the “power” of the proletarian dictatorship, that’s great! You feel “pressure,” that’s our joy; you feel “pain,” that’s our happiness. In a word, without proletarian dictatorship, the people will suffer, and the proletarian’s mountain will change color.

Zhou Yang shouts about how in a bourgeois dictatorship, “if you are dissatisfied and break the law, you can still run away,” but under proletarian dictatorship, “the organization is strict, where can you run to?” Zhou Yang’s deep longing for bourgeois dictatorship and his deep hatred for proletarian dictatorship are evident! Let me ask: In the new society, who feels that the proletarian dictatorship is “frightening,” “powerful,” and wants to “run”? It is precisely people like Zhou Yang, landlords, and bourgeois elements. The proletariat and laboring people are the masters of the country, and they are very content. There is no question of “running” or not. In the old society, the power was in the hands of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat and laboring people wanted to “run” but couldn’t; in the new society, we are the masters, and we can “use their own methods to deal with them”! Are you “dissatisfied”? Have you committed heinous crimes against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and want to escape? We will make sure you can’t “run” even if you want to! No matter where you “run” to the ends of the earth, we will capture you and bring you to justice!

You say we “do not treat people as people.” That’s right! We do not treat you counter-revolutionary “people” as people, and we will suppress you counter-revolutionary “people,” implement dictatorship, and make sure you never rise again!

Acknowledging, implementing, and defending proletarian dictatorship is the dividing line and touchstone between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism. Betraying proletarian dictatorship is fundamentally betraying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian revolutionary cause. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang is so frantically attacking proletarian dictatorship, trying to incite ghosts and monsters to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. He is the enemy of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletariat.

You say the proletarian dictatorship is “powerful”? That’s right! With our “power,” there is no “power” for you. We will make you taste the “power” of the proletarian dictatorship!

    就是要你尝尝这个“厉害”
    红代会新人大公社鲁迅兵团
    反革命修正主义分子周扬曾经不打自招地供认：“我一直记着胡风的……话。”
    一个反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总代表，“记着”一个反革命集团的总头目的“话”，是不足为怪的。周扬不仅“记着”了胡风的“话”，而且把胡风的话奉为至宝，处处使用胡风同样的
  “话”来恶毒攻击我们的社会主义制度，攻击无产阶级专政。
    胡风说新中国“绝大多数读者都在某种组织生活中”，因此他感到象“小媳妇一样，经常的怕挨打”，“咳一声都有人录音”。
    周扬说：“无产阶级专政厉害，比资产阶级专政还可怕！资产阶级社会，……不满意，犯了法还可以跑。我们社会组织严密，上哪儿跑呀？”现在“没地方发牢骚，没地方上疏，写在日记上还怕被发现。”
    胡风说：“今天中国，人还是不尊敬人的……”
    周扬说：“我们今天的社会是有不把人当人的现象。”
    请看，周扬的“话”和胡风的“话”，简直是象极了，象极了，象极了！
    周扬凶神恶煞地说“无产阶级专政可怕”，“厉害”，“不把人当人”。
    周扬及其一伙听着：我们是无产阶级专政的国家，对人民，我们给予充分的民主，充分的自由；对于敌人，对于你们这伙反革命修正主义分子，我们则实行专政。自由的权利，就是不给你们，一点不给，半点也不给！你们感到无产阶级专政的“厉害”，那太好了！你们感到“压力”，正是我们的愉快；你们感到“痛苦”，正是我们的幸福。总之一句话，没有无产阶级专政，人民就要遭殃，无产阶级的江山就要改变颜色。
    周扬叫嚷什么“资产阶级社会，……不满意，犯了法还可以跑”，而在无产阶级专政条件下，“组织严密，上哪儿跑呀？”周扬对资产阶级专政的深深怀念，对无产阶级专政的刻骨仇恨，溢于言表！试问：在新社会，感到无产阶级专政“可怕”、“厉害”想“跑”的，究竟是一些什么人呢？正是周扬之流的地主、资产阶级分子。无产阶级和劳动人民是国家的主人，心情舒畅得很，根本不存在什么“跑”不“跑”的问题。在旧社会，印把子掌握在地主、资产阶级的手里，无产阶级和劳动人民想“跑”也“跑”不了；在新社会，我们当家作了主，我们能够“以其人之道还治其人之身”！你们“不满意”吗？你们犯了反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行想逃之夭夭吗？我们要叫你们想“跑”也“跑”不掉！任凭你们“跑”到天涯海角，也要缉拿归案！
    你们说我们“不把人当人”。正是这样！我们就是不把你们这些反革命的“人”当人，就是要把你们这些反革命的“人”镇压下去，实行专制独裁，叫你们永世不得翻身！
    承认不承认、实行不实行和捍卫不捍卫无产阶级专政，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义的分水岭和试金石。背叛无产阶级专政，就是从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，背叛了无产阶级革命事业。反革命修正主义分子周扬如此疯狂地攻击无产阶级专政，妄图煽动牛鬼蛇神推翻无产阶级专政，他就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的死敌，无产阶级的死敌。
    你们不是说无产阶级专政“厉害”吗？正是这样！有我们的“厉害”就没有你们的“厉害”，我们就是要你们尝尝无产阶级专政的“厉害”！
