	Western Europe's centrifugal tendencies towards the U.S. are growing

	Kissinger visits the U.S. emphasizing West Germany's "independent policy"

	The U.S.'s attempt to divide West Germany and France fails

	Our newspaper reports that in mid-August, West German Chancellor Kissinger visited the United States and held talks with Johnson. The results of the talks indicate that the growing contradictions between the U.S. and West Germany have not been resolved, and there has been no substantial improvement in their relations.

	Johnson invited Kissinger to the U.S. this time to woo West Germany and to sow discord between West Germany and France. Due to the U.S. being mired in the Vietnam quagmire and unable to focus on the West, the French government of De Gaulle took the opportunity to intensify its resistance to U.S. hegemony, and the entire Western Europe showed signs of centrifugal tendencies towards the U.S. Especially after Kissinger's government came to power, it adopted a pro-French and anti-American policy, continuously improving relations with France, which made Washington very uneasy, fearing that West Germany would follow France's example and "go its own way."

	To divide West Germany and France, the Johnson administration this time went all out to praise Kissinger as "outstanding and capable," advocating that there are no "differences" between the U.S. and West Germany, and emphasizing the need for "patience, tolerance, and understanding." However, in the statement issued after the talks, Kissinger, apart from generally talking about "close cooperation and friendship" with the U.S., especially emphasized that West Germany should "pursue an independent policy." A reporter from the West German newspaper "Neue Ruhr Zeitung" reported after talking with Kissinger that Kissinger wanted to make Johnson believe that the relationship between the two countries must be built on a "new basis."

	According to reports, during this talk, the U.S. tried to "force" West Germany to accept the "Non-Proliferation Treaty." West Germany was very dissatisfied with the U.S.'s unilateral dealings with the Soviet Union. After the talks, Kissinger implicitly warned the U.S. that in the contacts between major powers, "do not ignore the interests of their allies."

	Another important issue in the talks was the relationship with Eastern Europe. In this regard, Kissinger and his spokesman's remarks after the talks indicated that West Germany would continue to use France to seek "normalization of relations" with the Soviet revisionists and Eastern European countries, in order to realize its plot to isolate and annex the German Democratic Republic.

	Although West Germany currently cannot completely shake off its dependence on the U.S., Kissinger's nine-month policy and his visit to the U.S. this time are enough to show that the pillar that Washington has long relied on to support U.S. hegemony in Western Europe has shaken. After returning to Bonn from his visit to the U.S., Kissinger immediately reiterated the need to "stand together with France," which showed the failure of Johnson's attempt to sow discord between West Germany and France.

### 西欧对美国离心倾向日益发展  基辛格访美强调西德“奉行独立政策”  美国分化西德法国的企图落空

    西欧对美国离心倾向日益发展
    基辛格访美强调西德“奉行独立政策”
    美国分化西德法国的企图落空
    本报综合报道　西德总理基辛格在八月中旬访问美国，同约翰逊进行了会谈。会谈结果表明，美国和西德之间日益增长的矛盾没有得到任何解决，双方关系也没有任何实质性的改善。
    约翰逊这次急于邀请基辛格去美国会谈，是为了拉拢西德，离间西德同法国的关系。由于美国深陷侵越泥潭难以西顾，法国戴高乐政府乘机加紧对抗美国霸权，整个西欧对美国的离心倾向有所发展。特别是基辛格政府上台以后采取了亲法疏美的方针，同法国不断改善关系，使华盛顿感到十分不安，担心西德也会步法国后尘，“走自己的路”。
    为了分化西德同法国的关系，约翰逊政府这一次竭力吹捧基辛格“杰出、能干”，宣扬美国和西德没有“分歧”，强调双方要有“耐心、容忍和谅解精神”。但是，基辛格在会谈后发表的声明中，除了泛泛地谈到同美国“密切合作和友好”之外，特别强调西德要“奉行独立政策”。西德《新来因鲁尔报》记者在同基辛格谈话后报道说，基辛格要使约翰逊相信，两国关系必须建立在“新的基础上”。
    据报道，在这次会谈中，美国力图“迫使”西德接受“防止核扩散条约”。西德对于美国背着它单独同苏联进行交易的做法十分不满。基辛格在会谈后，影射地警告美国，在大国接触中，“不要不考虑到它们的盟国的利益”。
    会谈的另一个重要问题是同东欧的关系。在这方面，基辛格及其发言人在会谈后发表的谈话表明，西德将继续借助法国来谋求同苏修和东欧国家的“关系正常化”，以便实现其孤立和吞并德意志民主共和国的阴谋。
    尽管西德目前仍然不能完全摆脱对美国的依赖，但是基辛格上台九个月的政策和他此次访美之行足以表明，一向被华盛顿当作支持美国在西欧霸权的这根支柱已经动摇了。基辛格在访美后回到波恩时立即重申要“和法国团结在一起”，说明了约翰逊企图离间西德法国关系的失败。
