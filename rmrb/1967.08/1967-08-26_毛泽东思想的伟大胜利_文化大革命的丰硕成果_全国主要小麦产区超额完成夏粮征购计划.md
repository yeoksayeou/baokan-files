In the unprecedented high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the grain front has brought good news of victory: the major wheat-producing areas nationwide have exceeded this year's summer grain procurement plan. This is a great victory for the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and another rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to statistics, by August 10, the total amount of new grain delivered to state granaries in the nine major wheat-producing provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi has exceeded the original procurement plan, and also surpassed the total summer grain procurement of these nine provinces last year. Among these nine provinces, Shanxi and Shaanxi have not yet completed their summer grain procurement plans due to their later harvest seasons and continuous rain during the summer harvest, which delayed threshing and shelling compared to last year. Currently, many production teams in these two provinces are busy delivering grain to state granaries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a tremendous driving force for these regions to complete their summer grain procurement tasks. After a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of rural people's commune members and revolutionary cadres have launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have thoroughly criticized selfishness and upheld selflessness, further raising their socialist consciousness and their political enthusiasm to support the Cultural Revolution and national construction to an unprecedented height. After this year's summer grain harvest, in the face of the excellent situation, the people's commune members and revolutionary cadres immediately proposed the five things not to forget in times of plenty: not to forget Chairman Mao, not to forget the Communist Party, not to forget socialist construction, not to forget supporting the state, and not to forget supporting world revolution. To make greater contributions to the Cultural Revolution, they voluntarily proposed to strive for exceeding the summer grain procurement plan under the principle of balancing the interests of the state, collective, and individual. Many communes and production teams have completed their annual procurement tasks in just one summer harvest season.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the spiritual outlook of grain procurement personnel in these regions has undergone significant changes. In many places, the revolutionary factions of the grain departments have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and in the summer grain procurement work, they have placed studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, earlier than everything, greater than everything, and heavier than everything. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, inspire everything, and promote everything. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," on "balancing the interests of the state, collective, and individual," on timely procurement and arrangement, and on "storing grain with the people," and have firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, this summer's grain procurement has seen good policy implementation and relatively reasonable task arrangements, with the vast majority of regions seeing an increase in rural per capita grain ration compared to last year.

Currently, from a national perspective, the summer grain procurement work has entered the final stage. Revolutionary workers in the grain departments across the country are seriously studying Chairman Mao's instructions on "thrift for revolution" and saving grain. They are determined to manage the new grain delivered to state granaries well and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　文化大革命的丰硕成果
    全国主要小麦产区超额完成夏粮征购计划
    据新华社二十五日讯  在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，粮食战线又传来胜利的喜讯：全国主要小麦产区已经超额完成了今年的夏粮征购计划。这是光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    据统计，到八月十日为止，河北、山西、江苏、安徽、山东、河南、湖北、四川、陕西等九个主要小麦产区入库新粮的总量已超过原定征购计划，并且超过了这九个省去年的夏粮征购总量。这九个省当中，山西、陕西两省因收获季节较晚，加上夏收期间阴雨连绵，打场脱粒比去年推迟，目前还没有完成夏粮征购计划。现在，这两个省的很多生产队，正在紧张地送粮入库。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，是这些地区胜利完成夏粮征购任务的巨大动力。经过一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，广大农村人民公社社员和革命干部掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。他们大破私字，大立公字，社会主义觉悟进一步提高，支援文化大革命、支援国家建设的政治热情空前高涨。今年夏粮获得丰收以后，在大好形势面前，人民公社社员和革命干部立即提出丰收五不忘：不忘毛主席，不忘共产党，不忘社会主义建设，不忘支援国家，不忘支援世界革命。他们为了对文化大革命做出更大贡献，主动提出要在国家、集体、个人三者利益兼顾的原则下，争取超额完成夏粮征购计划，许多公社、生产队在夏收一季就完成了全年征购任务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这些地区的粮食收购人员精神面貌有了显著变化。很多地方粮食部门的革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，在夏粮征购工作中，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，先于一切，大于一切，重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切。他们反复学习了毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，关于“必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的指示，关于及时收购，同时安排的指示，关于“藏粮于民”的指示，并且坚决遵照毛主席的指示办事，因此，今年夏粮征购当中，政策贯彻得好，任务也安排得比较合理，绝大多数地区农村口粮水平比去年提高。
    目前，从全国范围看，夏粮征购工作已进入结束阶段，各地粮食部门的革命职工正在认真学习毛主席关于“要节约闹革命”和节约粮食的指示，他们决心把入库的新粮认真管好，为无产阶级文化大革命做出新的贡献。
