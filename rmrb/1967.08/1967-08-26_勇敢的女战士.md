The 25-year-old Ali is a female platoon leader in the Thai people's armed forces. She was born into a poor peasant family. A deep class hatred drove her to join the armed struggle against the Thai and American reactionaries. Battle after battle has made her braver and stronger.

Once, Ali and a comrade were surrounded by a large enemy force during a battle. In the face of overwhelming enemy numbers, to foil the enemy's plot, Ali used a "draw the tiger away from the mountain" tactic, feigning an attack to the south. The foolish enemy fell for it and immediately pursued southward. However, Ali and her comrade quickly moved north and safely withdrew.

Later, Ali led her entire platoon to ambush the enemy during the day. Seeing more than ten reactionary soldiers and policemen strutting confidently, the people's armed forces were filled with rage and wanted to wipe out the enemy in one breath. But Ali remained calm. Only when the enemy entered the firing range did she give the order, concentrating the entire platoon's firepower to launch a fierce attack. Instantly, four enemies were killed and two were wounded. The remaining enemies were so frightened by this sudden attack that they immediately fled in all directions. Ali and her soldiers not only suffered no losses but also captured six rifles and a batch of spoils from the enemy. After this battle, the local military and civilians all called Ali the "brave female warrior."

    勇敢的女战士
    二十五岁的阿里是泰国人民武装的一位女班长。她生长在一个贫农的家里。强烈的阶级仇恨，使她参加了反对美泰反动派的武装斗争。一次一次的战斗，把她锻炼得越来越勇敢坚强。
    有一次，阿里和一位战友在战斗中遭到了大批敌人的围攻。在敌我力量悬殊的情况下，为了粉碎敌人的阴谋，阿里施了个“调虎离山”计，佯作往南攻，愚蠢的敌人信以为真，就立即向南追去。但是阿里和她的战友很快地转移到北面来，安全地撤了出去。
    后来，阿里带着全班战士在白天伏击敌人，眼看着十多名反动军警大摇大摆地走来，人民武装战士满腔怒火，真想一口气就把这批敌人干掉。但阿里却很镇静，直到敌人进入火力圈时，就一声令下，集中全班的火力，向敌人猛烈射击，一下子就打死四名、打伤两名敌人。其余的敌人被这一阵突如其来的打击吓破了胆，立即纷纷逃窜。阿里和她的战士不但一无损失，而且还缴获了敌人六枝步枪和一批战利品。这次战斗后，当地的军民都把阿里称为“勇敢的女战士”。
