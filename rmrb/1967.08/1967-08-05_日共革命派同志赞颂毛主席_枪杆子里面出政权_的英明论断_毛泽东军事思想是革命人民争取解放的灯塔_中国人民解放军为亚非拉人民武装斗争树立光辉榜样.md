	Japanese Communist Party Revolutionary Faction Comrades Praise Chairman Mao's Brilliant Judgment That "Political Power Grows Out of the Barrel of a Gun"
	Mao Zedong's Military Thought Is a Beacon for Revolutionary People Striving for Liberation
	The Chinese People's Liberation Army Sets a Brilliant Example for Armed Struggle by the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 3 — A responsible comrade from the Kyoshu District Committee of the Japanese Communist Party Revolutionary Faction in Fukuoka Prefecture recently spoke to a Chinese reporter and said that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is universally applicable to the revolutionary struggles of all peoples. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the world's revolutionary people in their struggle for liberation. Wherever the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, there the people will surely achieve thorough liberation. He said that Chairman Mao, in the long and complex practice of class struggle, has summed up the experience of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and has brilliantly, comprehensively, and creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism.

	He emphasized that the revolutionary people of the world enthusiastically acclaim that the world today is entering a new era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

	This Japanese revolutionary friend, who loves Chairman Mao and believes in Mao Zedong Thought without limit and who is resolutely fighting against the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party, warmly praised the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in defeating Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang bandits, and American imperialism, and in setting a brilliant example for the armed struggles being waged by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is an invincible proletarian army without equal in the world. This army has achieved great deeds for the liberation of the Chinese people and is supported and loved by the revolutionary people of Japan and the world. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is an example for the revolutionary people of all countries to learn from.

	This responsible comrade pointed out that Chairman Mao's teachings that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and "without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people" are universally correct and applicable in China, Japan, and other countries in the world. He said that in the face of the reality that the armed enemies of the nation and the class enemies use violence to suppress the oppressed and exploited peoples, whether one supports or does not support, propagandizes or does not propagandize, and implements or does not implement Chairman Mao's theory and line on people's war is the touchstone for distinguishing true from false Marxism-Leninism.

	He said that Chairman Mao has most clearly and profoundly expounded the truth that "the central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war." Chairman Mao's teachings have shown the true revolutionaries of Japan the correct path.

	After listing a large number of facts about how American imperialism has established vast military bases in Japan, actively revived militarism, and intensified the suppression of the revolutionary people of Japan, he angrily denounced the Japanese Communist Party revisionists for their frenzied opposition to the great Mao Zedong Thought, especially their malicious slander of Chairman Mao's great theory of people's war, peddling the black goods of Khrushchev revisionism, and advocating the fallacies of "peaceful transition," "parliamentary road," etc., deceiving the Japanese people and serving the reactionary clique of the United States and Japan.

	This responsible comrade finally said that the brilliant victories of the Chinese revolution, the brilliant victories in the war against American aggression in Korea, the brilliant victories in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, and the brilliant victories in the armed struggles being waged by the revolutionary people of Southeast Asia, all powerfully prove the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's truth that revolutionary war should be used to counter reactionary war.

    日共革命派同志赞颂毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断
    毛泽东军事思想是革命人民争取解放的灯塔
    中国人民解放军为亚非拉人民武装斗争树立光辉榜样
    新华社东京三日电　福冈县的日本共产党革命派京筑地区委员会的一位负责人最近对中国记者发表谈话指出，毛主席提出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断，对各国人民的革命斗争都是普遍适用的。毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是世界革命人民谋求解放的指路明灯。那里的人民掌握了毛泽东思想，那里的人民就一定取得彻底的解放。他说，毛主席在长期的复杂的阶级斗争实践中，总结了中国革命和世界革命的经验，天才地全面地创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    他强调指出，全世界革命人民热情欢呼当今的世界正在进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    这位无限热爱毛主席和无限信仰毛泽东思想、坚决同日共修正主义分子进行不调和斗争的日本革命朋友，热烈赞扬用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军打败了日本帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和美帝国主义的伟大胜利，为亚非拉各国人民正在开展的武装斗争树立了光辉的榜样。
    他说，毛主席亲手缔造和领导，林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是举世无双的不可战胜的无产阶级军队。这支军队为中国人民的解放建立了丰功伟绩，受到日本和世界各国革命人民的拥护和爱戴。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，是世界各国革命人民学习的榜样。
    这位负责人强调指出，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”、“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的教导，不论在中国、在日本和在世界其他国家都是普遍正确的，普遍适用的。他说，在武装到牙齿的民族敌人和阶级敌人用暴力镇压被压迫被剥削人民的现实面前，拥护不拥护、宣传不宣传、执行不执行毛主席关于人民战争的理论和路线，是区别真假马克思列宁主义的试金石。
    他说，毛主席最明确、最深刻地阐明了“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”这一真理。毛主席的教导，使日本的真正的革命者找到了正确的道路。
    他在列举美帝国主义在日本拥有庞大的军事基地、积极复活军国主义、加紧镇压日本革命人民的大量事实以后，愤怒谴责日共修正主义分子疯狂反对伟大的毛泽东思想，尤其是恶毒地诋毁毛主席关于人民战争的伟大理论，贩卖赫鲁晓夫修正主义的黑货，鼓吹什么“和平过渡”、“议会道路”等等谬论，欺骗日本人民，为美日反动派效劳的叛徒嘴脸。
    这位负责人最后说，中国革命的辉煌胜利，反对美帝侵略朝鲜的战争的辉煌胜利，越南人民抗美救国战争以及东南亚地区革命人民正在蓬勃开展的武装斗争的辉煌胜利，雄辩地证明了毛主席关于用革命战争反对反革命战争这一真理的无比正确。
