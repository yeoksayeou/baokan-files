Today, revolutionary masses in the capital continued to protest and march in front of the Indonesian Embassy in China, angrily denouncing the fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution for brazenly mobilizing military police and thugs to armedly attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, injuring our embassy staff. The protesters strongly support the most urgent and strongest protest made by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian reactionary government, and pay tribute to our brave red diplomats.

The marching protesters held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and red flags and banners, pouring in from all directions to the front of the Indonesian Embassy in China, continuously shouting, "Down with Suharto! Down with Nasution! The Indonesian reactionaries will never get away with their anti-China actions!" "The Indonesian reactionaries must thoroughly repay the blood debt they owe to the Chinese people!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The protesters angrily pointed out: The Indonesian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have once again instigated a horrifying anti-China incident, which is the most serious provocation against the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the Indonesian reactionaries' brazen acts of destroying international relations norms and seriously violating the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy! The blood debts owed by the Indonesian reactionaries to the Chinese people must be thoroughly repaid!

The protesters solemnly warned that the Suharto-Nasution-led Indonesian reactionaries, attempting to intensify anti-China sentiment to divert the Indonesian people's resistance against the fascist rule and ease the sharp class contradictions, are doomed to fail! Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out that the various oppressions inflicted by the reactionaries of all countries on the revolutionary people will ultimately only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people.

Revolutionary workers and students pasted the walls of the Indonesian Embassy in China with big-character posters, banners, and protest letters written in both Chinese and Indonesian. Some Red Guards, in the presence of the acting charge d'affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in China, loudly read a quote from Chairman Mao: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools." The Red Guards also issued a stern warning to him: Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Red Guards, together with the 700 million Chinese people, are determined to be the strong backing of our red diplomats in the Indonesian Embassy and the Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese, and to fight to the end with the Indonesian reactionaries. The final victory will surely belong to the great Chinese people! It will belong to the great Indonesian people! The Indonesian people will surely overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique and achieve complete liberation!

    “打倒苏哈托！”“打倒纳苏蒂安！”“印尼反动派反华绝没有好下场！”
    首都革命群众向印尼使馆示威
    新华社六日讯　今天，首都革命群众继续在印尼驻中国大使馆前示威游行，愤怒声讨以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权悍然调动军警暴徒，武装袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，打伤我使馆人员的严重暴行。示威的群众坚决支持我国外交部向印尼反动政府提出的最紧急、最强烈的抗议，并向英勇的我国红色外交战士致敬。
    游行示威的群众高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和红旗、标语牌，从四面八方涌向印尼驻中国大使馆门前，不断高呼：“打倒苏哈托！”“打倒纳苏蒂安！”“印尼反动派反华绝没有好下场！”“印尼反动派欠下中国人民的血债必须彻底偿还！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    示威的群众愤怒指出：印尼反动派同美帝国主义和苏修勾结在一起，又一次挑起骇人听闻的反华事件，是对七亿中国人民最严重的挑衅。中国人民绝不能容忍印尼反动派这样猖狂地破坏国际关系准则和严重侵犯中国大使馆外交特权的罪行！印尼反动派欠下中国人民的一笔笔血债，必须彻底偿还！
    示威群众严正警告说，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派，企图以加剧反华来转移国内人民对印尼法西斯统治的反抗，缓和尖锐的阶级矛盾，这是不可能的，徒劳的！我们伟大领袖毛主席早已指出，各国反动派对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。
    革命职工和革命师生在印尼驻中国大使馆的墙上贴满了用中文和印尼文写的大字报、标语和抗议书。一些红卫兵小将当着印尼驻中国大使馆临时代办的面，高声朗读毛主席语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”红卫兵小将们还向他提出严正警告：用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵同七亿中国人民一起，誓作我驻印尼使馆红色外交人员和印尼爱国华侨的坚强后盾，誓作印尼人民的坚强后盾，坚决同印尼反动派斗争到底，最后胜利必定属于伟大的中国人民！属于伟大的印尼人民！印尼人民必将打倒苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯集团，并取得彻底的解放！
