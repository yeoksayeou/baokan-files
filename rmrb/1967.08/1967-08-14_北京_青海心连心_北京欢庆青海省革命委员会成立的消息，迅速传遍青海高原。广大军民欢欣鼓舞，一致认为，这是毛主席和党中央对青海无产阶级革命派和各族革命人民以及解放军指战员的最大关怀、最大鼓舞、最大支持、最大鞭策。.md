The news of Beijing celebrating the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee quickly spread across the Qinghai Plateau. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians were overjoyed and unanimously agreed that this was the greatest concern, encouragement, support, and motivation from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the Qinghai proletarian revolutionary factions, people of all ethnic groups, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 13th: Just as the entire province of Qinghai was enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the news came that our great capital had broadcast the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and that the People's Daily and the PLA Daily had published special editorials to celebrate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionary factions and the stationed soldiers and officers were all overjoyed and unanimously agreed that this was the greatest concern, encouragement, support, and motivation from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the Qinghai proletarian revolutionary factions and people of all ethnic groups. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to carry out all the instructions of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters without any deviation, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to build Qinghai into a new Qinghai that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The news spread, and the members of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses of the August 18th proletarian revolutionary factions were ecstatic, spreading the word to each other. They carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao, held high red flags, and waved red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, beating drums and gongs as they marched through the streets, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" a thousand times over.

The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately organized its members to seriously study and discuss the editorials of the People's Daily and the PLA Daily. Everyone unanimously expressed that in the future, they would hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Qinghai. They pointed out that the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee was a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This victory should first be attributed to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They expressed their determination to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in all actions, to wield power and use power with Mao Zedong Thought; to never be arrogant or complacent, to not rely on past merits, to continue to temper and transform themselves in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to perform new deeds for the people; to stand among the masses, not above them. To regard themselves as servants of the masses, to see themselves as both a force for the revolution and an object of the revolution; at the same time, to be vigilant against the flattery and enticement of class enemies, to guard against the enemy's sugar-coated bullets, to always maintain a frugal revolutionary style, to forever preserve revolutionary youth, and to never disappoint the expectations of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

The August 18th proletarian revolutionary factions of the Qinghai industrial and transportation system were exceptionally happy, saying, "The editorials published by the People's Daily and the PLA Daily are excellent! They express the thoughts of our proletarian revolutionary factions, and we fully support them and will definitely carry them out. We will continue to educate, win over, and unite the masses who have been deceived in the revolutionary criticism, to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination'; to firmly believe in and rely on the PLA, to humbly learn from their good experiences and fine traditions of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and adhering to the 'four firsts,' to stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with them, to fight together, to grasp the revolution and promote production, to concentrate forces, wisdom, and targets, to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the party and their agents in Qinghai from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary young fighters of the August 18th revolutionary rebel alliance of Qinghai were extremely moved and overjoyed upon hearing the broadcast. They said with great emotion that the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee was only the first step of a ten-thousand-li long march, and the tasks ahead are still very glorious and arduous. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, and push the great criticism movement to a new high.

Today, from the leadership organs of the Qinghai garrison to the platoons, from the barracks to the outposts, there was a festive atmosphere. The Qinghai Provincial Military District Party Committee, led by Comrade Liu Xianquan, held a meeting that day, discussed and studied, and made a decision on implementing the inscriptions of Vice Chairman Lin and the editorials of the People's Daily and the PLA Daily. The decision required all levels of party committees, leadership organs, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers to seriously study and deeply understand the inscriptions of Vice Chairman Lin and the editorials of the People's Daily and the PLA Daily, and to carry them out resolutely. The decision stated that the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee marked the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai into a deeper new stage. The tasks ahead will be even greater and more arduous. We must more clearly and unshakably support the August 18th revolutionary leftists, and no matter what storms and waves we encounter, we must always stand together with the August 18th and other revolutionary leftist organizations, fight together, and achieve victory together.

The Qinghai Provincial Military District and the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the stationed troops, who had established new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of Qinghai and set an example for the PLA's leftist support work, held discussion meetings to study and discuss the editorials of the People's Daily and the PLA Daily. They decided to more firmly support the leftists, to carry out the great criticism deeply, thoroughly, and completely with them, to criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev and his agents in Qinghai from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, to complete the great historical tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    北京——青海心连心
    北京欢庆青海省革命委员会成立的消息，迅速传遍青海高原。广大军民欢欣鼓舞，一致认为，这是毛主席和党中央对青海无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民以及解放军指战员的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大支持、最大鞭策。
    据新华社西宁十三日电　正当青海全省军民热烈欢庆青海省革命委员会胜利诞生的时候，传来了我们伟大祖国首都广播了青海省革命委员会成立的消息的喜讯，传来了《人民日报》和《解放军报》专门为庆祝青海省革命委员会成立而发表的社论，广大无产阶级革命派和驻军指战员无不欢欣鼓舞，一致认为这是毛主席和党中央对青海无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大支持和最大鞭策。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，更加坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切指示，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把青海省建设成为一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红彤彤的新青海。
    喜讯传来，青海省革命委员会的成员和“八·一八”无产阶级革命派的广大战士欣喜若狂，奔走相告。他们抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举红旗，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，走上街头，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    青海省革命委员会立即组织委员们认真地学习和座谈了《人民日报》和《解放军报》的社论，大家一致表示，今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在青海的代理人批深、批透，批倒、批臭。他们指出，青海省革命委员会的成立，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利，这一胜利首先应归功于毛主席，归功于党中央。他们表示，一定要树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威，一切行动照毛主席指示办事，用毛泽东思想来掌好权、用好权；绝不骄傲自满，不靠吃老本，要在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中继续锻炼自己，改造自己，为人民立新功；要站在群众之中，而不是站在群众之上。要把自己当作人民群众的勤务员，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作革命的对象；同时，要警惕阶级敌人的捧场，拉拢，警惕敌人的糖衣炮弹的攻击，始终保持艰苦朴素的革命作风，永葆革命青春，绝不辜负毛主席和党中央的期望。
    青海工交系统的“八·一八”无产阶级革命派异常高兴地说，《人民日报》和《解放军报》发表的社论好得很，好极了！它说出了我们无产阶级革命派的心里话，我们完全拥护，一定照办。我们要继续在革命的大批判中教育、争取、团结受蒙蔽的群众，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”；要坚决相信和依靠解放军，虚心学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一的好经验和优良传统，和他们肩并肩、心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，集中力量，集中智慧，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派红代会的革命小将们听到广播后，万分激动，无比喜悦，他们满怀激情地说，青海省革命委员会的成立只是万里长征走完了第一步，今后的任务还十分光荣而艰巨。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬不断革命和彻底革命的精神，把大批判运动推向一个更新的高潮。
    今天，从青海驻军的领导机关到连队，从军营到哨所，一片节日的欢腾。以刘贤权同志为首的青海省军区党委当天召集会议，经过讨论和研究，作出了关于贯彻执行林副主席题词和《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论的决定。决定要求各级党委、领导机关和广大指战员对林副主席的题词和《人民日报》、《解放军报》的社论，必须认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。决定说，青海省革命委员会的成立，标志着青海省无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个更深入的新阶段。今后的任务将更加伟大，更加艰巨。我们必须更加旗帜鲜明地、坚定不移地支持“八·一八”革命左派，不论遇到什么惊涛骇浪，始终和“八·一八”等革命左派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    在青海无产阶级文化大革命中建立了新功，为我军支左工作树立了榜样的青海省军区和驻军部队广大指战员，纷纷举行座谈会，学习和讨论《人民日报》《解放军报》的社论。他们决心更加坚定地支持左派，同他们一起把革命的大批判搞深搞透搞彻底，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人，胜利完成一斗、二批、三改的伟大历史任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
