Hold High the Revolutionary Flag of Criticism with Mao Zedong Thought
Thoroughly Settle the Accounts of Ro Lusheng's Anti-Party and Usurpation of the Military Crimes
The Eighth Company of Nanjing Road

In the midst of the nationwide surge of mass revolutionary criticism, the agents of Khrushchev in China within the military, such as Peng Dehuai and Ro Lusheng, have been exposed and paraded! This is a great event for the entire Party and the military, a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and a great victory for the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao! This once again proves that the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by the great commander Mao Zedong and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a high level of political awareness, and is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Any schemer, conspirator, or counter-revolutionary revisionist, no matter what flag they raise, what tricks they play, what methods they use, or what backing they have, they will inevitably suffer a crushing defeat if they try to meddle with the People's Liberation Army and engage in anti-party and usurpation activities.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to retain it must have a powerful army." Throughout the entire socialist period, class struggle is concentrated in the struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of its restoration by the proletariat. The number one capitalist-roaders within the Party are the representatives of the capitalist restoration forces. Peng Dehuai and Ro Lusheng are the agents of Khrushchev in China within the military. They use their important positions within the military to brazenly oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. They promote their reactionary bourgeois military line, desperately seize the gun, and attempt to turn our great people's army into a tool for their counter-revolutionary restoration. The heinous crimes of these anti-party and usurpation elements must be thoroughly settled.

Our Eighth Company has grown up under the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. From the day our company was named, the great schemer and conspirator Ro Lusheng has used various tricks and schemes to try to make our Eighth Company deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to achieve his despicable goal of pulling down the red flag and raising the white flag. However, it is easier to shake a mountain than to shake a revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought! All of us in the company hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as our political microscope and mirror, repeatedly repelling their arrogant attacks and thoroughly smashing Ro Lusheng's counter-revolutionary plots.

I

In June 1963, soon after our company was named, to report to the revolutionary masses of Shanghai about our company's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the higher-level Party committee organized an exhibition. Because this exhibition consistently highlighted Mao Zedong Thought, during the pre-exhibition period, it received enthusiastic praise from Comrade Ke Qingshi and the leaders of the three military units stationed in Shanghai. However, the villain Ro Lusheng, without even looking at half of it, flew into a rage, shouting, "There are too many 'cultural' elements, not enough 'military' elements." "If you don't bring out more 'military' elements, you can't reflect the true strength of the Eighth Company." He ruthlessly cut out all the so-called "cultural" parts that reflected our company's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and then filled the gaps with "military" elements. As a result, an exhibition that highlighted Mao Zedong Thought was almost turned into an exhibition that highlighted military technology by this villain Ro Lusheng.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Lusheng did this with the clear intention of using this exhibition to promote his reactionary bourgeois military line and create public opinion for his anti-party and usurpation plot to restore capitalism. We, the cadres and soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, do not fall for his tricks. Although he can use his high position to cut out dozens of pictures, he cannot cut out our red hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The more Ro Lusheng hates Mao Zedong Thought, the more we study Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades say: "Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the strongest. We must fully highlight Mao Zedong Thought, now and in the future, forever highlight Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army and the lifeblood of revolutionary soldiers. Flowers cannot bloom without the sun, crops cannot grow without dew, and revolutionary soldiers cannot find their political direction without Mao Zedong Thought to arm them. All the comrades in the Eighth Company study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and do their best to bring Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of every revolutionary.

II

Is politics first or is the military first? Is highlighting politics or highlighting the military? This is the fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and the bourgeois military line, and it is a major issue concerning which line we implement, which path we follow, and which class we serve as the tool of dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. Without the infusion of progressive political spirit into the army, without progressive political work to carry out this infusion, it is impossible to achieve true unity between officers and soldiers, to arouse the maximum war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers, and for all techniques and tactics to play their due role on the best foundation." The core of Chairman Mao's military thought is to highlight proletarian politics, to build the army politically first and foremost. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Lusheng goes against this, under the pretext of opposing so-called "empty politics," he promotes military first, technology first, brazenly attacks proletarian politics, and attacks the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. In 1964, our Eighth Company, following the instructions of the leaders, went to the mountains for political field training. Before departure, all the comrades in the company unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the broad masses in the area, to learn from the brotherly units in the area, and to truly learn their good thoughts, good styles, and good traditions. At this moment, it was again this villain Ro Lusheng who, behind the back of Vice Chairman Lin, stirred up a black wind of large-scale competitions throughout the military. Under his personal planning, piles of training targets were pressed onto our heads. It was obvious that he wanted to destroy us and make us submit to his bourgeois military line, following him down the wrong path. "A thorough materialist is fearless." The earth can split, the sky can collapse, but with Mao Zedong Thought to arm us, we fear nothing! In the face of this extremely sharp and complex class struggle, our company's Party branch firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings on political military building and firmly followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to uphold the "four firsts," using the resolution of the 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Meeting as a weapon, and engaged in a head-on struggle against the black wind of large-scale competitions stirred up by Ro Lusheng and his ilk.

We believe that in the great struggle between the two military thoughts and the two military lines, whether to resist or to blindly follow this evil wind is a matter of stance and a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao. Therefore, we cannot be vague, nor can we allow the slightest compromise. We will firmly carry out what is in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! We will firmly resist and struggle against what goes against Chairman Mao's teachings! This is our attitude. In the face of this black wind, we firmly stood our ground. We said: Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned! We proposed "three unchanging" and "five no turnarounds" in response to the active thoughts within the company. "Three unchanging" means: In the face of changing environments and tasks, we must not change our study of Chairman Mao's works, class education, and grasping active thoughts. "Five no turnarounds" means: No turnaround when time is tight, no turnaround when tasks are heavy, no turnaround when pressure is great, no turnaround when achievements are made, no turnaround when setbacks are encountered. On the training ground, we further proposed "three reflections," which are: When thirsty, think of Ganlu Mountain, when hot, think of Qiu Shaoyun, when hungry, think of the Long March. The Party branch's slogans were unanimously supported by all the comrades in the company. Some comrades said: Our company was built on Mao Zedong Thought, advances with Mao Zedong Thought, and grows with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how heavy the tasks are or how great the pressure is, with Mao Zedong Thought, no difficulty is insurmountable. Some comrades said: Politics is the locomotive; without a locomotive, no matter how many carriages there are or how full they are, they cannot move. If you don't know why you are training, you won't know whom to aim your gun at on the battlefield. Therefore, the more fiercely the black wind of large-scale competitions blows, the greater our determination to study Chairman Mao's works becomes. The political atmosphere of "studying 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' under kerosene lamps and singing songs in thatched huts" is always thick. To make our actions in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, comrades voluntarily paved Mao Zedong Thought quotations with stones on the training ground, some engraved Chairman Mao's words on the handles of grenades, and everyone proposed to "study 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' every day and make revolution every day."

With Mao Zedong Thought, there is political direction; with Mao Zedong Thought, there is boundless power. In this great storm, we not only resisted Ro Lusheng's black wind of large-scale competitions, but all the comrades in the company also received an excellent tempering. That year, the entire company produced a large number of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Some comrades who had overstayed their service also achieved "more active work, older soldiers with redder hearts."

III

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle has not ended.... The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." Ro Lusheng, the agent of Khrushchev in China within the military, vigorously promotes the reactionary bourgeois military line, which is an important part of the entire criminal activities of Khrushchev in China and his gang to restore capitalism and subvert proletarian dictatorship. His actions are an attempt to use his bourgeois worldview to change our army, change our Party, change the color of our country, and adapt to the needs of his master, Khrushchev in China, to restore capitalism. He brazenly attacks politics and highlights the military, aiming to dig out our lifeblood, remove our soul, turn us into political idiots, and thus become his tools for usurping the Party and the military.

Today, just like his master Khrushchev in China, Ro Lusheng, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, has been exposed in broad daylight. However, the poison of the bourgeois military line he spread has not been thoroughly criticized and eliminated. All the comrades in our company are determined to hold even higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to hold even higher the flag of revolutionary criticism, to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating a fallen dog," and to overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that they will never be able to rise again!

    高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜
    彻底清算罗瑞卿反党篡军的罪行
    南京路上好八连
    在举国上下展开群众性的革命大批判的新高潮中，中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，被揪出来示众了！这是全党全军的一件大好事，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一重大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级军事路线的又一重大胜利，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的又一重大胜利！这再一次证明：由伟大的统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有高度政治觉悟的、无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的伟大军队。任何野心家、阴谋家、反革命修正主义分子，不管他们打着什么样的旗号，施展什么样的阴谋，运用什么样的手法，有什么样的后台老板，他们想在人民解放军身上打主意，搞篡军反党活动，都必然要碰得头破血流，以彻底失败而告终。
    毛主席教导我们说：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”在整个社会主义时期，阶级斗争集中地表现为资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是资本主义复辟势力的总代表。彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，是中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人，他们利用在军内窃踞的重要职务，肆无忌惮地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，推行他们反动的资产阶级军事路线，拚命抓枪杆子，妄想使我们这支伟大的人民军队变成他们实行反革命复辟的工具。对于这一小撮反党篡军分子的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算。
    我们八连是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想培育下成长起来的一个连队。从我们连命名的那一天起，大野心家、大阴谋家罗瑞卿就玩弄各种阴谋手段，施展各种花招，妄想使我们八连脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，以达到他拔红旗、插白旗的卑鄙目的。但是，撼山易，撼用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士难！我们全连同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜和照妖镜作武器，一次又一次地击退了他们的猖狂进攻，彻底粉碎了罗瑞卿的反革命阴谋。
                             一
    一九六三年六月，我们连命名不久，为了向上海广大革命群众汇报我们连队活学活用毛主席著作的情况，上级党委举办了一个展览会。由于这个展览会自始至终地突出了毛泽东思想，预展期间，曾先后得到柯庆施同志和驻沪三军首长的热情赞扬。而罗瑞卿这个坏家伙，没等看上一半，就大发雷霆，叫嚷什么：“文的太多，武的不突出。”“不多拿一些武的出来，不能反映八连真正过得硬。”他对凡是反映我们连队活学活用毛主席著作的所谓“文”的部分，大砍特砍，然后把砍去的地方，都用“武”的来拼凑。结果，一个突出毛泽东思想的展览会，被罗瑞卿这个坏家伙搞得几乎变成了一个突出军事技术的展览会。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿这样做的目的，完全暴露了他企图利用这个展览会，推行反动的资产阶级军事路线，为他反党篡军实现资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋制造舆论。我们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级建军路线的干部战士，根本就不吃他这一套。他尽管可以凭仗他的高职，砍掉几十张图片，但是他砍不掉我们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的红心。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。罗瑞卿越是仇视毛泽东思想，我们就越是加紧学习毛泽东思想。同志们说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最过得硬。我们就是要全力突出毛泽东思想，现在要突出，将来还要突出，永远要突出毛泽东思想。”毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我们革命战士的命根子。鲜花没有太阳不能开放，庄稼没有雨露不能生长，革命战士没有毛泽东思想来武装，就要迷失政治方向。我们八连全体同志更加勤奋地大学特学毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想，尽最大的努力把毛泽东思想送到每个革命群众的心坎里。
                               二
    政治第一还是军事第一，突出政治还是突出军事，这是毛主席的无产阶级建军路线同资产阶级军事路线的根本分歧点，也是关系到我们执行那一条路线、走那一条道路、做那一个阶级的专政工具的大是大非的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”毛主席的建军思想的核心，就是突出无产阶级政治，首先和着重从政治上建军。可是，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，却反其道而行之，他在反对所谓“空头政治”的幌子下，大搞军事第一、技术第一，肆无忌惮地冲击无产阶级政治，冲击学习毛主席著作的群众性热潮。一九六四年，我们八连遵照首长的指示，拉到山区进行政治野营训练。临行之前，全连同志一致表示，一定要向驻地广大群众学习，要向驻地的兄弟部队学习，要把他们的好思想、好作风、好传统真正学到手。就在这个时候，又是罗瑞卿这个坏家伙，竟然背着林副主席，在全军刮起一股大比武的黑风。在他一手策划下，大堆大堆的训练指标往我们头上压。很明显，这是他妄想整垮我们，要我们屈服于他的资产阶级军事路线，跟着他走邪路。“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。地可以裂，天可以塌，有毛泽东思想来武装，我们什么也不怕！在这极为尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争面前，我们连队党支部坚决遵循毛主席政治建军的教导，坚决遵照林副主席坚持“四个第一”的指示，以一九六○年军委扩大会议决议为武器，同罗瑞卿之流刮起的这股大比武黑风展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    我们认为，在两种建军思想、两条建军路线的大搏斗中，对这股妖风，是抵制还是盲从，这是一个立场问题，也是对毛主席的根本态度问题。因此，我们决不能含糊，更不允许搞半点折中。符合毛主席革命路线的事，我们坚决照办！违背毛主席教导的事，我们坚决抵制，坚决斗争！这就是我们的态度。在那股黑风面前，我们坚决顶住了。我们说：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！我们针对连里的活思想，提出了“三个不变”，“五个不转向”。“三个不变”是：在环境变、任务变的情况下，做到学习毛主席著作不能变，阶级教育不能变，抓活思想不能变。“五个不转向”是：时间紧，不转向；任务重，不转向；压力大，不转向；有了成绩，不转向；受了挫折，不转向。在训练场上，又进一步提出了“三个想想”，这就是：渴了想想上甘岭，热了想想邱少云，饿了想想长征路。党支部提出的这些口号，受到全连同志一致的拥护。有的同志说：我们连队靠毛泽东思想起家，靠毛泽东思想前进，靠毛泽东思想成长，任务再重，压力再大，有了毛泽东思想，什么困难都不在话下。有的同志说：政治是火车头；没有火车头，车厢再多，装得再满，也开不动。不懂得为什么练兵，上了战场也不知道把枪口指向谁。因此，大比武的妖风刮得越猛，我们连学习毛主席著作的决心就越大。“煤油灯下学‘毛著’，茅草屋里把歌唱”的政治空气，始终是浓浓的。为了使自己的行动符合毛主席的教导，同志们主动地在训练场上用石子铺成毛主席语录，有的把毛主席的话刻在手榴弹柄上，大家提出要“天天学‘毛著’，日日闹革命”。
    有了毛泽东思想，就有了政治方向；有了毛泽东思想，就有了无穷的力量。在这场大风大浪中，我们不仅抵制了罗瑞卿大比武的妖风，全连同志也受到了一次极好的锻炼。这一年，全连就涌现了大批学习毛主席著作积极分子。一些超期服役的老同志，也做到了“工作更积极，兵老心更红”。
                          三
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争并没有结束。……无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人罗瑞卿，大力推行反动的资产阶级军事路线，是中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙复辟资本主义、颠覆无产阶级专政整个罪恶活动的重要组成部分。他的所作所为，就是妄图用他的资产阶级世界观来改造我们的军队，改造我们的党，改变我们国家的颜色，以适应他的主子、中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的需要。他肆无忌惮地冲击政治，突出军事，就是妄想挖掉我们的命根子，抽去我们的灵魂，使我们成为政治上的庸人，从而变成他篡党篡军的工具。
    今天，同他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫一样，罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子的原形已经暴露在光天化日之下。但是，他们所散布的资产阶级军事路线的流毒还没有得到彻底批判和肃清。我们全连同志决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更高地举起革命的批判旗帜，发扬“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭，使他们永世不得翻身！　（新华社上海二十一日电）
