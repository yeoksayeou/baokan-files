The People's Liberation Army is a great army personally founded by Chairman Mao Zedong. In the past, during our battles against domestic and foreign enemies, the army loved the people, and the people supported the army. The unity between the army and the people formed an irresistible force for a people's war, overthrowing the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, and establishing a proletarian dictatorship. After the founding of the nation, since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the work of the Military Commission, our army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carried out a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Under the boundless nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, Mai Xiande, and the model soldier for loving the people, Zhao Erchun, have emerged. The path they have taken is the path of wholeheartedly serving the people. They have carried forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, becoming a new generation of soldiers of the people, and setting examples for us to learn from.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people is the sole purpose of this army." We strive to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts in our actual actions. When a storm comes, if fishing boats encounter danger at sea and call for help, we quickly connect the phone, and the warships swiftly set sail, rescuing the people from the raging waves back to the shore. The people say, "You are the people's lifesavers." When the busy farming season comes, we labor together with the people. The people say, "You are good members of the people's commune." When poor and lower-middle peasants fall ill, medical staff proactively go to their homes for treatment. The people say, "You are the people's health workers." The army organizes a performance team to perform for the people, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The people say, "You are the people's propagandists." When a fire occurs, we immediately rush to the scene, carrying forward the spirit of the model soldier for loving the people, Zhao Erchun, who sacrificed his life to save others from the fire. The people say, "You are the people's firefighters." We have done a little for the people, and the people have given us much encouragement. At the same time, they frankly point out the shortcomings in our work, helping us continuously improve our ability to serve the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "An army that is seen by the people as their own army is invincible in the world." On the coastal defense front, the army loves the people and helps the people; the people love and support the army. The unity between the army and the people forms a true iron wall on the coastal defense front. Whether it is sky pirates, sea robbers; whether it is the American imperialists or the Kuomintang bandits, as long as they dare to invade, they will meet their doom.

    全心全意为人民服务是人民军队的本色
    “爱民模范赵尔春班”班长　徐立群
    我们人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队。过去，在跟国内外敌人战斗中，军爱民，民拥军，军民团结如一人，形成了人民战争排山倒海的力量，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，建立了无产阶级专政的政权。建国以后，从林彪副主席主持军委工作以来，我军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展群众性的活学活用毛主席著作运动。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育下，出现了雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥、麦贤得以及爱民模范赵尔春等无数优秀的人民战士。他们所走的路，就是全心全意为人民服务的路。他们发扬了人民军队的光荣传统，成为人民子弟兵新的一代，为我们树立了学习的榜样。
    毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们把毛主席这一光辉思想努力贯彻到实际行动中去。暴风来了，渔船在海上遇险呼救，我们就迅速接通电话，军舰迅速出海，从惊涛骇浪中把群众接回岸上来。群众说：“你们是人民的救生员。”农忙季节来了，我们就和群众一起劳动。群众说：“你们是人民的好社员。”贫下中农有了病，医务人员就主动上门诊治。群众说：“你们是人民的卫生员。”部队组织了战士演出队去为群众演出，热情地宣传毛泽东思想。群众说：“你们是人民的宣传员”。发生了火灾，我们就立即奔赴火场，发扬爱民模范赵尔春同志为人民舍身救火的精神。群众说：“你们是人民的消防员。”我们为人民做了一点事情，人民给了我们很多鼓励。同时，对我们工作中的缺点毛病，也坦率地提出批评，帮助我们不断地提高为人民服务的本领。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。海防前线上军队热爱人民，帮助人民；人民群众就热爱军队，拥护军队。军民团结如一人，形成了海防前线真正的铜墙铁壁。管它是天上的飞贼，海上的强盗；是美国佬，还是蒋介石匪帮，只要来窜犯，就叫它有来无还。
