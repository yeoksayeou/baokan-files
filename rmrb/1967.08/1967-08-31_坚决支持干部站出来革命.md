	Resolutely Support Cadres to Come Out and Make Revolution
	Rèn Lìxīn

	Correctly handling cadres, resolutely supporting cadres to come out and make revolution, and boldly using revolutionary cadres are important components of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: we must believe in and rely on the majority of cadres.

	Over the past seventeen years in our country, fundamentally speaking, it has been seventeen years of proletarian dictatorship, seventeen years in which the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been dominant throughout the Party. Under the long-term education and cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Party, and through the tempering and testing of class struggle, the majority of our cadres are good and relatively good. Believing in this, we dare to boldly use revolutionary cadres; doubting this, we will inevitably hesitate to further liberate cadres; opposing this, we will inevitably reject all cadres, deny all cadres, and fall into the quagmire of anarchism.

	This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's primary task is to smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, thoroughly criticize the reactionary line represented by him, and eliminate a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the organs of proletarian dictatorship. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong and knock down all the majority of cadres, will we not negate the proletarian dictatorship of the past seventeen years?

	Our policy towards those in the bourgeois headquarters headed by the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party is clear: we must overthrow them or half-overthrow them.

	Our policy towards revolutionary cadres is also clear: we must bravely protect them, enthusiastically help them, and boldly use them. Their shortcomings and mistakes should be helped to overcome using the method of handling contradictions among the people, that is, the method of unity-criticism-unity.

	Even for cadres who have made serious mistakes, as long as they do not persist in their mistakes, sincerely correct them, and are forgiven by the broad revolutionary masses, they can still stand up and join the revolutionary ranks.

	There are many cadres who have insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line, resisted the bourgeois reactionary line, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, relatively early stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction and waged a resolute struggle against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Such revolutionary cadres should become the core backbone forces of the revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organs at all levels.

	Some cadres, after many years of peaceful life, have to varying degrees become detached from the masses and from reality, gradually falling behind. They have many shortcomings and mistakes. The storm of the Cultural Revolution is vigorously cleansing the dirt from their bodies. The impact of the revolutionary youngsters has deeply touched their souls. These comrades should conduct self-examinations and correct their mistakes early. Hesitation will lead to passivity. These comrades, as long as they not only regard themselves as objects of the revolution but also as forces of the revolution, truly dare to throw themselves into the torrent of revolutionary struggle, firmly support the proletarian revolutionary faction, and unambiguously struggle against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary faction should dare to support them, help them, and boldly use them.

	There are also some cadres whose revolutionary will has waned, who do not emphasize politics, and who lack revolutionary spirit. On the surface, they appear to be "good-natured people," offending no one, getting along well with everyone, receiving few big-character posters, and possibly getting many votes in elections. Such cadres can be given appropriate work. However, they should not be placed in important leadership positions or included in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership core.

	Chairman Mao's cadre policy is principled. That is, to distinguish between the major and minor faults of cadres and to examine the entire history and work of cadres. Whether one raises or does not raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whether one emphasizes or does not emphasize proletarian politics, whether one has or does not have revolutionary spirit, these are the major faults of a cadre. When we look at a cadre, we should see whether he supports Chairman Mao, whether he supports Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, whether he supports the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whether he stands on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and whether he supports the proletarian revolutionary faction.

	For the mistakes made by revolutionary cadres, we should adopt a serious attitude and conduct a factual analysis. We should clarify the environment, historical conditions, and nature of the mistakes. To attack one point without considering the rest, exaggerate facts, and arbitrarily elevate the level of the mistake, and to "kill" a comrade who has made a mistake with one blow, is a wrong practice that violates Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

	We should welcome with great enthusiasm cadres who come out to make revolution. If cadres come out to make revolution and are instead attacked, there must be a problem. Either a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are causing trouble, or sectarian errors have gained the upper hand among the masses. It should be seriously pointed out that attacking revolutionary cadres who dare to come out is absolutely not allowed.

	Some organizations manipulated by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party or by a few conservative elements often appear in an ultra-leftist guise, attacking cadres who come out to make revolution. They deliberately confuse the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people, deliberately confuse power-holders taking the capitalist road with proletarian power-holders, and indiscriminately "cook them all in one pot." They do this to try to muddy the waters. We must not be fooled.

	Now, the true proletarian revolutionary faction should have the great spirit of the proletariat, actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely, boldly, and actively support cadres to come out and make revolution, and create the necessary conditions for them to "make their appearance."

	Some comrades in the proletarian revolutionary faction have a "fear" in their minds, fearing that they might use the wrong cadres, fearing that cadres might turn bad in the future, fearing that they might be labeled "conservatives." In fact, not daring to boldly use revolutionary cadres is precisely a very conservative viewpoint. The proletarian revolutionary faction should stand on the height of the proletarian worldview, fully and deeply understand Chairman Mao's cadre line and cadre policy, boldly use revolutionary cadres, and mobilize a large number of revolutionary cadres to strive to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of revolutionary youngsters have emerged. They have courage and wisdom and are new revolutionary forces. Their weakness is that they lack fighting experience and have not been tested much. All revolutionary cadres must, with strong class feelings, cherish them, help them, and enable them to grow vigorously and become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Comrade Mao Zedong said more than twenty years ago: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted"; "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out a common cause, and prevent sectarian tendencies."

	Today, we revisit Chairman Mao's teachings, which have great guiding significance for implementing the Party's cadre policy, boldly using revolutionary cadres, and enabling revolutionary leading cadres to fully play their core backbone role.

    坚决支持干部站出来革命
    任立新
    正确对待干部，坚决支持干部站出来革命，大胆使用革命干部，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要内容。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：要相信和依靠干部的大多数。
    我国过去的十七年，从根本上说来，是无产阶级专政下的十七年，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在全党占统治地位的十七年。在毛主席和党的长期教育和培养下，经过阶级斗争的锻炼和考验，我们干部的大多数是好的和比较好的。相信这一条，我们就敢于大胆地使用革命干部；怀疑这一条，我们势必在进一步解放干部的问题上畏缩不前；反对这一条，就必然排斥一切干部，否定一切干部，陷入无政府主义的泥坑。
    这一次无产阶级文化大革命，最主要的任务是摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，彻底批判以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线，清除无产阶级专政机构里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。如果不分青红皂白，把大多数干部统统打倒，其结果不是把十七年来的无产阶级专政都否定了吗？
    对以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部里的人，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们的方针是明确的，就是打倒，或者半打倒。
    对革命的干部，我们的方针也是明确的，就是要勇敢地保护、热情地帮助、大胆地使用。对他们的缺点和错误，应当按照处理人民内部矛盾的方法，即团结——批评——团结的方法来帮助他们加以克服。
    即使是对于犯了严重错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大革命群众所谅解了之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。
    有不少干部，坚持无产阶级革命路线，抵制资产阶级反动路线，在无产阶级文化大革命中，比较早地站到无产阶级革命派一边，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作了坚决的斗争。这样的革命干部，应当成为各级革命的“三结合”临时权力机构中的核心骨干力量。
    有些干部，经过多年的和平生活，不同程度地脱离群众，脱离实际，渐渐落伍了。他们身上的缺点错误不少。文化大革命的风暴，猛烈地荡涤着他们身上的污垢。革命小将的冲击，深深地触动了他们的灵魂。这些同志，要早检查，早改正，不要吞吞吐吐。吞吞吐吐，就会被动。这些同志，只要他们不仅把自己作为革命对象，而且把自己作为革命的力量，真正敢于投身到革命斗争的洪流中去，坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，毫不含糊地同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。只要这样做了的，无产阶级革命派就要敢于支持他们，帮助他们，并大胆地使用他们。
    也有这样一些干部，他们革命意志消沉，不突出政治，没有革命干劲。表面上看起来，是“老好人”，什么人也不得罪，人缘搞得好好的，给他贴的大字报不多，选举时说不定得票不少。这样的干部，可以给他们适当的工作。但是，不能够把他们摆在重要的负责岗位上，拉进革命“三结合”的领导核心。
    毛主席的干部政策是有原则的。这就是要区分干部的大节和小节，考察干部的全部历史和全部工作。高举不高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出不突出无产阶级政治，有没有革命干劲，这就是干部的大节。我们看一个干部，就是要看他是不是拥护毛主席，是不是拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是不是拥护无产阶级文化大革命，是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级司令部一边，是不是支持无产阶级革命派。
    对于革命的干部所犯的错误，要用严肃的态度，进行实事求是的分析。要弄清犯错误的环境、历史条件和性质。攻其一点，不及其余，夸大事实，无限上纲，把犯错误的同志“一棍子打死”，这是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的错误做法。
    我们要用满腔热情欢迎站出来革命的干部。如果干部站出来革命，反而受打击，这里面必有问题。或者是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在从中捣乱，或者是群众中宗派主义的错误倾向占了上风。应该严肃指出，打击敢于站出来的革命干部，是绝不能允许的。
    有些被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派或少数保守分子所操纵的组织，往往以一种极“左”的面目出现，打击站出来革命的干部。他们故意混淆敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，故意混淆走资本主义道路的当权派和无产阶级当权派，不加区别地“一锅煮”。他们这样做，实际上是企图把水搅浑。我们千万不要上当。
    现在，真正的无产阶级革命派，要有无产阶级的伟大气魄，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，要坚决地、大胆地、积极地支持干部站出来革命，为他们“亮相”创造必要的条件。
    有些无产阶级革命派的同志头脑中有个“怕”字，害怕用错了干部，害怕干部将来变坏了，害怕被人戴上“保守派”的帽子。其实，不敢大胆使用革命干部，恰恰是一种极其保守的观点。无产阶级革命派要站在无产阶级世界观的高度上，全面地深刻地理解毛主席的干部路线和干部政策，大胆地使用革命干部并带动广大的革命干部，努力地在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，涌现出一大批革命小将。他们有魄力，有智慧，是革命的新生力量。他们的弱点是比较缺乏斗争经验，经受的考验还不多。一切革命干部，必须怀着强烈的阶级感情，爱护他们，帮助他们，使他们茁壮地成长，成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    毛泽东同志在二十多年前说过：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断”；“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”
    今天，我们重温毛主席的这一教导，对于贯彻党的干部政策，大胆使用革命干部，让革命的领导干部充分发挥核心骨干作用，有着重大的指导意义。
