The Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged the strongest protest with the British government over the British authorities in Hong Kong's brutal suppression of the patriotic press and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong. The British authorities must revoke the illegal ban on publications within two days and must release the patriotic journalists without charge.

New China News Agency, August 20 - The responsible official of the Western Europe Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopkinson, this evening and handed him a note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The note strongly protests the series of extremely serious crimes committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong in their brutal suppression of the patriotic press and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong. The note solemnly declares that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must, within 48 hours, revoke the ban on the "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xinwu Daily," release without charge the 19 patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and the 34 staff members of the three patriotic newspapers, withdraw the illegal lawsuits against the "Ta Kung Pao," "Jing Bao," and the Nanchang Printing Company and the Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company, and restore the normal operations of the aforementioned newspapers and printing companies. Otherwise, the British government must bear all the consequences. The full text of the note is as follows:

British Chargé d'Affaires in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China requests that the British Chargé d'Affaires in China immediately convey the following to the British government.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have engaged in a series of brutal political persecutions against the patriotic press and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong, reaching an extremely serious level.

Over the past two months, the British authorities in Hong Kong have, through illegal abductions, unreasonably arrested the journalists Hu Ping, Chen Fengying, Chen Demu, Luo Yuhe of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency; Liu Zhuping, Huang Yilu of the "Wen Hui Bao"; Tan Sijun, Luo Xiangrong, Wang Ning of the "Ta Kung Pao"; Liang Liyi, Qian Baowen of the "Xinwan Bao"; Chen Zifeng of the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily"; Wu Zaicheng of the "Jing Bao"; and Xu Yuncheng of the "Economic Guide." On August 9, the British authorities in Hong Kong again arbitrarily and unreasonably arrested Hu Diqiu, the publisher of the "Hong Kong Evening News," Pan Huaiwei, the publisher of the "Tianfeng Daily," Chen Yanjuan, the supervisor of printing, Li Shaoxiong, the chairman of the board of Nanchang Printing Company and the supervisor of printing of the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," and Zhai Nuanhui, the manager of the company. On August 17, the British authorities in Hong Kong brazenly ordered the "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xinwu Daily" to cease publication and filed illegal lawsuits against the "Ta Kung Pao," "Jing Bao," and the Nanchang Printing Company and the Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company, which print patriotic newspapers. On August 19, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched armed police and agents to raid the "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xinwu Daily," and illegally arrested 34 staff members of the three newspapers.

The British authorities in Hong Kong's bloody suppression of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon has aroused the indignation of the entire Chinese people. The patriotic newspapers and journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon have truthfully reported and exposed these fascist atrocities, which is entirely just and their sacred duty. The British authorities in Hong Kong hate and fear them to death, fabricating various groundless charges, subjecting them to various barbaric political persecutions, attempting to strangle patriotic public opinion, and suppress the voices of justice and truth. This can only fully expose the extremely ugly, fascist, and imperialist face of the British government to the people of the world.

The Chinese government once again strongly protests to the British government and solemnly declares that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must, within 48 hours, revoke the ban on the "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xinwu Daily," release without charge the aforementioned 19 patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and the 34 staff members, withdraw the illegal lawsuits against the "Ta Kung Pao," "Jing Bao," and the Nanchang Printing Company and the Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company, and restore the normal operations of the aforementioned newspapers and printing companies. Otherwise, the British government must bear all the consequences.

    我外交部照会英政府最强烈抗议港英疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业
    港英必须两天内撤销非法停刊令
    必须无罪释放我爱国新闻工作者
    新华社二十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部西欧司负责人今天晚上召见英国驻华代办霍普森，交给他我国外交部照会，就香港英国当局疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者的一系列极为严重的罪行，向英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。照会严正声明，英国政府和香港英国当局必须在四十八小时内撤销对《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》的停刊令，无罪释放十九名香港爱国新闻工作者和三家爱国报纸的三十四名工作人员，撤销对《大公报》、《晶报》以及南昌印务公司和香港报业印刷公司的非法诉讼，并恢复上述各报纸及印刷公司的正常业务。否则英国政府必须对此承担一切后果。照会全文如下：英国驻华代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部要求英国代办处立即把下列事项转告英国政府。
    香港英国当局对香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者进行一系列疯狂的政治迫害，已经达到了极为严重的程度。
    两个多月来，香港英国当局以非法绑架的手段无理逮捕了新华社香港分社记者薛平、陈凤英、陈德穆、罗玉和；《文汇报》记者刘柱平、黄一溜；《大公报》记者谭思俊、罗向荣、王宁；《新晚报》记者梁丽仪、邝宝文；《香港商报》记者陈子峰；《晶报》记者吴在城；《经济导报》记者许云程。八月九日，香港英国当局又横蛮无理地非法逮捕了《香港夜报》社长胡棣周，《田丰日报》社长潘怀伟、督印人陈艳娟，南昌印务公司董事长、《香港商报》督印人李少雄和该公司经理翟暖晖。八月十七日，香港英国当局竟悍然勒令《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》停刊，并且对《大公报》、《晶报》以及承印爱国报纸的南昌印务公司和香港报业印刷公司提出了非法诉讼。八月十九日，香港英国当局又出动武装警察和特务，袭击《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》，并非法逮捕三报工作人员三十四人。
    香港英国当局血腥镇压港九爱国同胞的滔天罪行，引起全中国人民的愤慨。港九爱国报纸和爱国记者如实报道，揭露这些法西斯暴行，完全是正义的，是他们的神圣职责。香港英国当局对他们恨得要命，怕得要死，竟然罗织各种莫须有的罪名，对他们进行种种野蛮的政治迫害，企图扼杀爱国舆论，压制正义和真理的声音，这只能在全世界人民面前彻底暴露英国政府极端丑恶的法西斯帝国主义的狰狞面目。
    中国政府再一次向英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议，并且严正声明，英国政府和香港英国当局必须在四十八小时内撤销对《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》的停刊令，无罪释放上述十九名香港爱国新闻工作者和三十四名工作人员，撤销对《大公报》、《晶报》以及南昌印务公司和香港报业印刷公司的非法诉讼，恢复上述各报纸及印刷公司的正常业务。否则英国政府必须对此承担一切后果。
