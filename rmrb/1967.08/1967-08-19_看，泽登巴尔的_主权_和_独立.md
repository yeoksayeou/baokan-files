On August 9, the Mongolian revisionist Dash-Ombor Erte openly insulted the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing, the center of the world revolution that people yearn for, and deliberately created a serious anti-China incident. The heroic Chinese Red Guards were filled with righteous indignation, caught the criminal on the spot, sternly denounced him, and resolutely fought back, exposing the shameless face of the Soviet revisionists' Mongolian lackeys and defending the sovereignty and dignity of our great motherland. What a heartening revolutionary act!

However, the Zedenbal clique, instead of apologizing to the Chinese people, issued a so-called "government statement" under the instigation of their master, brazenly accusing the Chinese Red Guards of being "hooligans" and "thugs," "invading" Mongolia's "state sovereignty and national independence," and "damaging" their so-called "freedom of the motherland's honor and dignity."

Chairman Mao said: "Only those who have no shame can say shameless things. What right do the diehards have to stand in front of us and make a sound?" The Soviet revisionists' lackey, the Zedenbal clique, what right do you have to talk about "sovereignty," "independence," "honor," and "dignity"?

The Zedenbal clique has sold itself to the Soviet revisionists and groveled at their feet, which has been an open secret. Since the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped power in the Soviet Union, you have followed the Soviet revisionists' orders. Your every word and deed depends on your master's face. Your every move is commanded by Moscow. In the international anti-China chorus orchestrated by the United States and the Soviet revisionists, you play a shameful role; in the Soviet revisionists' dirty dealings of betraying the revolution of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples, you serve as a pathetic cheerleader. The Zedenbal clique's rampant anti-China stance is not at all surprising. Look, hasn't the anti-China frenzy of the Mongolian revisionist lackeys won the applause of their Soviet revisionist masters?

Do the Zedenbal gang want to "guarantee" Mongolia's "independence" and "sovereignty"? That's nonsense! You have already brought shame upon the Mongolian people by selling Mongolia's "independence" and "sovereignty" to the Soviet revisionists. Even if you drained the Selenga River dry, you couldn't wash away this shame; even if you cut down all the trees on the Altai Mountains to make pens, you couldn't write down all your treacherous crimes of selling out the country for personal gain!

Mongolia has actually become a new type of colony of the Soviet revisionists. It is precisely this group of traitors, the Zedenbal clique, who invited the wolves in and became puppets. The Soviet revisionists' evil hands not only control Mongolia's political power but also the economic lifeline. Under the guise of so-called "economic cooperation," "loans," "international division of labor," and "equal trade," the Soviet revisionists have brutally exploited and plundered Mongolia. Geological exploration rights do not belong to Mongolia, mining rights do not belong to Mongolia, tariff rights do not belong to Mongolia. Mongolia has become a market for the Soviet revisionists to peddle low-quality goods and junk, as well as a supply base for meat and raw materials. Mongolia exports one sheep to the Soviet revisionists and can only get a toy sheep in return. Mongolia has been "independent" for more than forty years, but to this day, it has almost no industry, even having to import matches and glue from the Soviet Union. Agriculture is also in a state of continuous failure. Due to the Soviet revisionists' brutal plunder, Mongolia's main economic sector, animal husbandry, has also suffered severe bankruptcy. Over the past decade, just in animal husbandry, the Soviet revisionists have plundered more than 46 billion old rubles. This group of traitors' wholesale sellout of Mongolian national interests has left Mongolia with a mountain of debt. Now, the hardworking Mongolian people owe the Soviet revisionists an average of 5,850 old rubles per person, a debt that will be difficult to repay for generations to come.

Not only that, Soviet revisionist elements run rampant in Mongolia, doing as they please, even killing and arson, and can get away with it. More than 16,000 so-called "construction soldiers" from the Soviet revisionists have entered Mongolia, severely trampling on Mongolia's sovereignty. Yellow culture from the Soviet revisionists is rampant everywhere, poisoning the hearts and minds of the Mongolian people and youth.

The Soviet revisionists implement a form of colonial policy abroad and push new colonialism on small countries. Mongolia is a living example of this.

In a word, Mongolia's "sovereignty," Mongolia's "independence," Mongolia's "honor," and Mongolia's "dignity" have long been sold out by the Zedenbal clique, a small group of traitors to the Mongolian revolution! The traitors dare to talk about "independence" and "sovereignty," isn't that a huge joke?

Do the Mongolian people want to defend their country's sovereignty and national independence? Yes, they definitely do! But this sovereignty and independence are not the so-called "sovereignty" and "independence" of the Zedenbal clique, the agents of the Soviet revisionists in Mongolia, but the true independence and sovereignty of the Mongolian people. One day, under the guidance of great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Mongolian people will rise up in rebellion, overthrow the Zedenbal clique, and trample them underfoot. They will take back the country's sovereignty and national independence from the hands of the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys!

### 看，泽登巴尔的“主权”和“独立”
首都红代会北师大井冈山红卫兵

专栏：红卫兵战地

    看，泽登巴尔的“主权”和“独立”
    首都红代会北师大井冈山红卫兵
    八月九日，蒙修分子达希敖额尔特公然在世界革命人民向往的中心北京，猖狂地侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席像，蓄意制造了一起严重的反华事件。英雄的中国红卫兵义愤填膺，当场捉住这个罪犯，严正声讨，坚决斗争，揭露了苏修走卒蒙修的无耻嘴脸，维护了我们伟大祖国的主权和尊严。这是多么大快人心的革命举动啊！
    但是，泽登巴尔集团不但不向中国人民低头认罪，反而在其主子的唆使下，抛出所谓“政府声明”，气势汹汹地反诬中国红卫兵是“流氓”、“暴徒”，“侵犯”了蒙古的“国家主权和民族独立”，“损害”了他们的什么“自由祖国的荣誉和尊严”。
    毛主席说：“只有不要脸的人们才说得出不要脸的话，顽固派有什么资格站在我们面前哼一声呢？”苏修的奴才泽登巴尔集团，你们还有什么资格侈谈“主权”、“独立”、“荣誉”和“尊严”呢！
    泽登巴尔集团卖身投靠苏修，在苏修脚下摇尾乞怜，早已是公开的秘密。自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺苏联政权以来，你们紧跟苏修的指挥棒团团转。你们的一言一行，都要看主子的脸色。你们的一举一动，都听命于莫斯科。你们在美帝、苏修策动的国际反华大合唱中，扮演一名可耻的丑角；在苏修叛卖亚非拉人民革命的肮脏勾当中，充当一名可怜的吹鼓手。泽登巴尔集团的猖狂反华，是丝毫不奇怪的。请看，蒙修奴才的反华狂，不是博得了他们苏修主子的喝采了吗？
    泽登巴尔之流要“保障”蒙古的“独立”和“主权”吗？真是活见鬼！你们向苏修出卖蒙古的“独立”和“主权”，已经使蒙古人民蒙受奇耻大辱。即使倾色楞格河之水也无法洗刷这奇耻大辱；即使伐阿尔泰山之木为笔，也难写尽你们丧权辱国、卖国求荣的滔天罪行！
    蒙古事实上已经沦为苏修的新型殖民地。正是泽登巴尔这一伙叛徒，引狼入室，甘当傀儡。苏修的罪恶黑手不仅操纵了蒙古的政治大权，而且控制了蒙古的经济命脉。苏修披着所谓“经济合作”、“贷款援助”、“国际分工”、“平等贸易”等外衣，对蒙古进行了残酷的剥削和掠夺。地质勘探权不属于蒙古，矿山开采权不属于蒙古，贸易关税权不属于蒙古。蒙古竟然变成了苏修推销低质量商品和破烂货的市场，以及肉食和原料的供应基地。蒙古向苏修出口一只羊，只能换取苏修的一个玩具羊。蒙古“独立”已经四十多年了，可是直到现在，工业几乎一无所有，甚至连火柴、胶水都要从苏联进口。农业也是连年歉收。由于苏修的残酷掠夺，使蒙古的主要经济部门畜牧业也遭受严重破产。十多年来，仅畜牧业一项就被苏修剥削四十六亿多旧卢布。这一伙叛徒对蒙古民族利益的大拍卖，使蒙古债台高筑。现在，勤劳的蒙古人民平均每人欠苏修竟达五千八百五十旧卢布，背上了子孙万代都难以还清的阎王债。
    不仅这样，苏修分子在蒙古国土上横行霸道，为所欲为，甚至杀人放火，也可以逍遥法外。一万六千多苏修的所谓“建筑兵”进驻蒙古，严重蹂躏蒙古的主权。苏修的黄色文化到处泛滥，毒害蒙古人民和青年的心灵。
    苏修对外实行变相的殖民政策，对弱小国家推行新殖民主义，蒙古就是一个活标本。
    一句话说到底，蒙古的“主权”，蒙古的“独立”，蒙古的“荣誉”，蒙古的“尊严”，早已经被泽登巴尔这一小撮蒙古人民革命的叛徒拍卖殆尽了！卖国贼竟然出来侈谈“独立”、“主权”，这不是天大的笑话吗？
    蒙古人民要不要维护自己国家的主权和民族的独立呢？要的，肯定要的！但是，这种主权和独立，决不是苏修集团在蒙古的代理人泽登巴尔之流的所谓“主权”和“独立”，而是蒙古人民真正的独立和主权。终有一天，蒙古人民要在伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，起来造反，把泽登巴尔之流打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，把国家的主权、民族的独立，从苏修及其奴才的手中夺回来！
