Let the Revolutionary Fire Burn More Fiercely! – In Praise of the Japanese Gear Playhouse's Performance of the Play "Wildfire"

The five performances of the play "Wildfire" by the Japanese Gear Playhouse in Beijing have been enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary masses of our country with its revolutionary political content and surging revolutionary rebellious spirit.

This play is the result of the comrades of the Gear Playhouse bravely fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and a small clique of Japanese Communist Party revisionist traitors.

The performance of this play expresses the boundless loyalty of the Japanese revolutionary people to Mao Zedong Thought.

"Wildfire" depicts the fighting deeds of the armed uprising of peasants in the Chichibu mountain area of Japan in 1884. The comrades of the Gear Playhouse use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and present this historical event, serving the current political tasks of the Japanese revolutionary people to oppose imperialism and revisionism.

In the 1860s, after the "Meiji Restoration" in Japan, the rising bourgeoisie and the old feudal rulers colluded to establish a monarchical system representing the landlord-bourgeoisie. The ruthless exploitation by landlords and capitalists, the heavy taxes imposed by the imperial government, and the usurious practices of moneylenders drove millions of impoverished peasants to ruin, leaving them with no way out. To resist the economic exploitation and political oppression of the ruling class, impoverished peasants took up arms and fought tenaciously against the imperial government. During this period, large-scale peasant uprisings occurred dozens of times each year in various parts of Japan, dealing heavy blows to the rule of the Japanese imperial government. The armed struggle of peasants in the Chichibu mountain area in 1884 was the largest and most far-reaching peasant uprising at that time.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development or to overthrow the reactionary ruling class and enable the people to seize power." "Wildfire" truly presents this great revolutionary idea through a historical event.

In the play, the large landlord, capitalist, and county council member Seiki, relying on the protection of the imperial government's authoritarian apparatus, carries out the most barbaric plunder and exploitation of silk farmers. If the silk farmers show the slightest resistance, he summons the military police to brutally suppress them. Where there is oppression, there is the spark of resistance; the heavier the oppression, the more intense the fire of resistance. The silk farmers of the Chichibu mountain area, through their personal experiences, came to realize the falsehood and deception of the so-called "Meiji Restoration," and recognized that to change the unreasonable social system, they had to unite and fight. Thus, under the leadership of the poor people's party leader Maozu, they took up arms, transforming the struggle against usury into an armed uprising against the imperial government, fighting to seize power from the rulers.

In the midst of this peasant armed struggle, "Wildfire" portrays a revolutionary hero of the poor peasants—the leader of the poor people's uprising, Maozu. This revolutionary, harboring deep hatred for the landlords, capitalists, and the imperial government, is filled with the revolutionary spirit of daring to rebel, daring to fight, and daring to win. Facing the siege of armed police, he fearlessly resists and fights tenaciously, defeating the capitalist lackeys and armed police, leaving them in disarray; when captured, he laughs loudly and declares war on the reactionary authoritarian government: "The poor people's party of Chichibu, whether it's the emperor or the county magistrate, we fear no one!" Such revolutionary words vividly show the heroic spirit and revolutionary tradition of Japanese revolutionary peasants. In the struggle, Maozu further realizes the significance of organizing and seizing power through armed struggle. Thus, he raises the banner of rebellion, organizing tens of thousands of impoverished peasants, taking up hunting rifles and bamboo spears, fighting to overthrow the imperial government and establish a people's government, resolutely "turning the world upside down" for the government that represents the interests of the exploiting class!

The theme of "Wildfire," as well as the revolutionary heroes like Maozu, are an inspiration to the revolutionary people and a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, as well as a heavy blow to the new and old revisionists.

Through the fighting deeds of Maozu and other members of the poor people's party, "Wildfire" presents the great idea of armed seizure of power; at the same time, through the exposure of the betrayal of the "Liberal Party" member Seiji, it directs the criticism directly at the traitorous clique of Miyamoto.

Look, this very person who sings high praises of "freedom" and "civil rights," when the poor people's party launched an armed uprising, he blew cold winds and kindled evil fires, spreading slogans like "parliament" and "negotiation" everywhere, deceiving the revolutionary masses into laying down their weapons and canceling the revolution. Once, when the imperial police were brutally suppressing the peasant uprising, he secretly betrayed the enemy and became a lackey of the authoritarian government. Reflecting on the past, isn't the traitorous clique of Miyamoto, who claims to inherit and develop the "revolutionary tradition of the Japanese Communist Party," just the same as Seiji and his ilk?

Whoever opposes violent revolution, opposes armed seizure of power, and deceives the revolutionary people into laying down their weapons, taking the path of "parliamentary struggle" and "peaceful transition," is a traitor to the revolution—the most treacherous enemy of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Their end will be the same as Seiji in the play, being spat upon by the revolutionary people.

The revolutionary spirit of the Chichibu peasant uprising in history, the revolutionary tradition left by the poor people's party fighting for the seizure of power, will forever inspire the fighting will of the Japanese revolutionary people in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

At present, the Japanese people, rich in revolutionary fighting traditions, are engaged in unyielding struggles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries; the true Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary forces of the Japanese Communist Party are growing and developing, striking back at the traitorous clique of Miyamoto. The revolutionary people of Japan, as shown in the finale of "Wildfire," are advancing to victory under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary tide will sweep away the stubborn fortresses of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The literature and art of the proletariat are a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat, as Lenin said, are 'gears and screws' in the entire revolutionary machine."

The cultural warriors of the Gear Playhouse, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, insist on serving the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people in opposing imperialism and revisionism, insist on combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the drama a "gear" in the revolutionary machine. Their process of performing and revising "Wildfire" is a process of continuously learning Mao Zedong Thought and guiding creative practice with Mao Zedong Thought.

Through the successful performance of the Gear Playhouse, we see that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high in the hearts of the Japanese revolutionary people!

Wherever the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies, the revolutionary struggle there is invincible!

I wish the comrades of the Gear Playhouse to hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and carry the revolution through to the end! I wish this "gear" of the Japanese people's revolutionary cause to oppose imperialism and revisionism to keep turning forever under the impetus of Mao Zedong Thought, crushing all the stubborn forces of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction that are entrenched in Japanese territory into powder!

    让革命的怒火燃烧得更猛烈！
    ——赞日本齿轮座剧团演出的话剧《野火》
    北京工农兵文艺公社　周向东
    日本齿轮座剧团在北京演出的五场话剧《野火》，以它革命的政治内容和澎湃的革命造反精神，受到了我国革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    这出戏，是齿轮座剧团的战友们，同美日反动派和一小撮日共修正主义叛徒集团进行英勇斗争的战斗成果。
    这出戏的演出，表达了日本革命人民无限忠于毛泽东思想的豪情壮志。
    《野火》表现的是一八八四年日本秩父山区农民武装起义的战斗事迹。齿轮座的战友们，运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想分析表现这一历史事件，以此为当前日本革命人民反帝、反修的政治任务服务。
    十九世纪六十年代，日本“明治维新”以后，新兴的资产阶级同旧的封建统治者相互勾结，建立起代表地主资产阶级的天皇专制主义的王权制度。地主、资本家的残酷剥削，天皇政府的苛捐杂税，高利贷者的重利盘剥，把千百万贫苦农民逼得家破人亡，走投无路。为了反抗统治阶级的经济剥削和政治压迫，贫苦农民纷纷拿起武器，向天皇政府展开英勇顽强的斗争。这一时期，在日本各地，每年都发生数十起大规模的农民起义，沉重地打击了日本天皇政府的统治。一八八四年，秩父山区爆发的农民武装斗争，就是当时规模最大、影响最深远的一次农民起义。
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”《野火》通过一个历史事件，真实地表现了这个伟大的革命思想。
    在剧中，大地主、大资本家、县议会议员正吉，仗恃天皇政府专制机构的庇护，对蚕农实行最野蛮的掠夺和压榨。蚕农稍有反抗，他就调来军警疯狂镇压。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗压迫的火种；压迫愈重，反抗的烈火愈旺。秩父山区的蚕农，通过切身的遭遇，认识到所谓“明治维新”的虚伪性和欺骗性，认识到要改变不合理的社会制度，只有靠自己团结起来进行斗争。于是，他们在贫民党领袖茂助的领导下，揭竿而起，由打倒高利贷的斗争，发展成反抗天皇政府的武装起义，向统治者进行夺权斗争。
    《野火》在这场农民武装斗争的烈火中，塑造了一个贫农的革命英雄形象——贫民党起义领袖茂助。这个革命者，对地主、资本家以及天皇政府怀着深仇大恨，浑身充满了敢于造反、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。他面对武装警察的围攻，临危不惧，顽强抵抗，把资本家走狗、武装警察打得狼狈不堪；在被捕时，他纵声大笑，向反动的专制政府宣战：“秩父的贫民党，管他是天皇还是县太爷，谁都不怕！”这种革命的豪言壮语，生动地表现了日本革命农民的英雄气概和革命传统。在斗争中，茂助更加认识到组织起来进行武装夺取政权的意义。于是，他就举起义旗，组织起成千上万的贫苦农民，拿起猎枪、竹枪，为推翻天皇专制政府、建立人民政府而战斗，坚决把代表剥削阶级利益的天皇政府“打它个天翻地覆”！
    《野火》所表现的主题思想，以及茂助等革命英雄形象，是对革命人民的鼓舞，是对美日反动派的沉重打击，也是对新老修正主义者的沉重打击。
    《野火》通过茂助等贫民党人的战斗事迹，表现了武装夺取政权的伟大思想；同时，又通过对“自由党人”清次叛变行为的揭露，把批判的锋芒直接指向宫本叛徒集团。
    请看，就是这个高唱“自由”、“民权”的自由党人，当贫民党发动武装起义的时候，他却吹阴风，点邪火，到处散布“议会”、“谈判”之类的论调，诱骗革命群众放下武器，取消革命。曾几何时，当天皇警察疯狂镇压农民起义的时候，他就暗中投敌叛变，充当了专制政府的帮凶。抚今思昔，那个口口声声要继承和发展“日共革命传统”的宫本叛徒集团，同清次之流不正是一丘之貉吗！
    谁反对暴力革命，反对武装夺取政权，诱骗革命人民放下武器，走什么“议会斗争”、“和平过渡”的道路，谁就是革命的叛徒——无产阶级革命事业最阴险的敌人。他们的结局必将象剧中的清次一样，被革命人民所唾弃。
    历史上秩父农民起义的革命精神，为夺取政权而进行武装起义的贫民党所留下的革命传统，将永远鼓舞日本革命人民反帝反修的斗争意志。
    目前，富有革命斗争传统的日本人民，正在同美日反动派展开不屈不挠的斗争；日本共产党真正的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命力量，正在发展壮大，大造宫本叛徒集团的反。日本的革命人民，正象《野火》的尾声里所表现的那样——在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下胜利前进。四海翻腾，风雷激荡，革命的洪流必将冲垮帝、修、反的顽固堡垒。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”
    齿轮座剧团的文艺战士，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持为日本革命人民反帝、反修的革命事业服务，坚持同工农兵群众相结合，使戏剧成为革命机器中的“齿轮”。他们演出、修改《野火》的过程，就是不断学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅创作实践的过程。
    通过齿轮座剧团成功的演出，我们看到，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗正在日本革命人民心中高高飘扬！
    毛泽东思想的伟大红旗飘扬在那里，那里的革命斗争就无往而不胜！
    预祝齿轮座剧团的战友们，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，将革命进行到底！预祝这个日本人民反帝、反修革命事业的“齿轮”，在毛泽东思想的推动下，永远转动不息，将盘踞在日本国土上的帝、修、反顽固势力统统碾得粉碎！（附图片）
