Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeshi, with the support of U.S. imperialism, visits the Soviet Union and conspires with the Kosygin clique to plot anti-China schemes

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, our correspondent reports: Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeshi recently visited Moscow at the invitation of the Soviet revisionist clique and held talks with them. This is another important step in the further tightening of collusion and "cooperation" between the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese Sato government in the context of the Kosygin-Johnson Glassboro black meeting and the intensified global collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States.

According to Japanese newspapers and news agencies, the U.S. ruling clique is actively supporting and caring about this Soviet-Japanese talks. As early as eight days before Miki's visit to the Soviet Union, on July 12, Bundy, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, had told Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Shitara Takezo, "The U.S. government is very concerned about Miki's visit to the Soviet Union." On July 18, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Johnson hurriedly went to give Miki instructions before his departure to the Soviet Union, conveying the U.S. views on the post-Glassboro talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the Middle East situation, the Vietnam problem, and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. On the same day, Sato also briefed Miki on his recent meeting with U.S. Vice President Humphrey in Seoul.

According to Kyodo News and Japanese newspapers, in the talks between Miki and the Soviet revisionist leaders Kosygin, Gromyko, and Kuznetsov, the Glassboro talks, the Middle East situation, and the Vietnam problem occupied an important position.

According to reports, at Miki's request, Kosygin introduced the contents of his talks with U.S. imperialist leader Johnson in Glassboro and the Soviet revisionist clique's "thoughts" on Soviet-U.S. cooperation, the Middle East situation, and the Vietnam "peace talks" to him without any reservation. As for the future foreign policy of the Soviet revisionists, according to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" and Kyodo News, Kosygin said in the talks on the 22nd, "I heard someone say that the Soviet Union's peace policy will change in the future. This statement is wrong. Without a policy of peaceful coexistence, the world will only experience war." Kosygin also said, "I am averse to war. From this perspective, looking at the foreign policy of the Soviet government will not be wrong." In the talks, Kuznetsov said in discussing the Soviet Union's foreign policy, "If unfortunately a military conflict occurs, it should be ended as soon as possible." Therefore, he emphasized that the Soviet revisionists' "actions" and "attitudes" in this Middle East incident, in collusion with the United States, repeatedly undermining the anti-aggression struggle of the Arab peoples, are "correct."

As a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese Sato government's Foreign Minister Miki repeatedly expressed in the talks the hope that the Soviet revisionists would "use their influence" to "find ways to peacefully resolve" the Vietnam War and "urge" the Soviet revisionists to "actively work" in the field of disarmament. On July 24, in the talks with Gromyko, Miki said to Gromyko, "Eliminating local wars is a task for the future." Gromyko replied, "I have the same feelings about the thoughts of the Japanese government." It is reported that the result is that both sides agreed to "resolve the Vietnam War problem as quickly as possible." In addition, according to Miki's statement to Japanese reporters on the 23rd, the Soviet revisionists are also "very enthusiastic" about "preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons." All these situations clearly expose the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's attempt, after the Glassboro talks, to more desperately collude with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to undermine and suppress the armed revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world.

The Soviet revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries also plotted anti-China and anti-Asian peoples' conspiracies in this talk. According to reports, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov openly attacked China's foreign policy in his talks with Miki. He said that for the so-called "stability" of Southeast Asia, the Soviet revisionists are willing to "cooperate" with Japan. Miki then explained to the Soviet side the issue of Japan's participation in the "Ministerial Conference of the Asia-Pacific Region," asking the Soviet revisionists to "rest assured." He said that the participants in this organization, which was planned by the United States, "all have reservations about China, but have no hostility towards the Soviet Union." He said that Japan has "no intention of keeping the Soviet Union out of the door." "The Soviet Union can also participate" in the U.S.-backed tool for economic plunder in Asia, the "Asian Development Bank and Agricultural Development Fund," "to jointly develop Asia."

To please the Japanese Sato government and develop Soviet-Japanese "cooperation," the Kosygin clique also suggested that the two countries negotiate on the issue of concluding a post-war treaty. For many years, the Soviet Union has refused to discuss Japan's demand to return the southern Kuril Islands. However, it is reported that Miki has already sensed the Soviet Union's intention to compromise on this issue in this talk. At the same time, in this talk, both sides further discussed issues such as "joint development of Siberia," air routes between Moscow and Tokyo, and fishery cooperation, and finally signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation in the fishery sector, exchanged the ratification documents of the Soviet-Japanese Consular Convention, and reached an agreement on mutual visits between Kosygin and Sato. The Japanese side is extremely satisfied with these results. On this point, a Kyodo News reporter reported from Moscow on the 22nd: "In the view of the Japanese side, the Soviet Union's position has progressed considerably compared to the past."

    苏修头目同佐藤政府大做反革命交易
    日本外长在美帝支持下访苏同柯西金之流推心置腹策划反华阴谋
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：日本外务大臣三木武夫最近应邀到莫斯科访问，同苏修集团进行了会谈。这是在柯西金—约翰逊葛拉斯堡罗黑会后苏美加紧全球勾结的背景下，苏修和日本佐藤政府进一步加紧勾结和“合作”的又一个重要步骤。
    据日本报刊和通讯社报道，美国统治集团对这次苏日会谈是积极支持和关怀的。早在三木访苏前八天，即七月十二日，负责东亚和太平洋地区的美国助理国务卿邦迪，就曾经对日本驻美大使下田武三说，“美国政府对三木访苏极为关心”。七月十八日，美国驻日本大使约翰逊在三木赴苏前夕，急急忙忙去向他面授机宜，向他传达了美国对葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后的美苏关系、中东局势、越南问题和防止核扩散等问题的看法。同一天，佐藤也向三木介绍了他不久前在汉城同美国副总统汉弗莱会谈的情况。
    据共同社和日本报刊透露，在三木同苏修大小头目柯西金、葛罗米柯、库兹涅佐夫等人的这次会谈中，葛拉斯堡罗会谈、中东局势和越南问题，占有重要地位。
    据报道，应三木的要求，柯西金在会谈中，向他“丝毫不保留地”介绍了他同美帝头子约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗会谈的内容，以及苏修集团对苏美合作、中东局势和越南“和谈”等问题的“想法”。至于苏修今后的外交政策，据日本《每日新闻》和共同社报道，柯西金在二十二日会谈时对三木说，“我听到有人说，苏联的和平政策将来是会改变的。这种说法是错误的。如果没有和平共处政策，世界只有经历战争。”柯西金还说，“我是厌恶战争的。从这个角度去看苏联政府的外交政策，是不会错的。”会谈中，库兹涅佐夫在谈到苏联的外交政策时说，“如果一旦不幸发生了武力冲突，就尽快谋求结束冲突。”因此，他强调，苏修在这次中东事件中同美国勾搭一起，一再破坏阿拉伯各国人民的反侵略斗争的“行动”和“态度”是“正确的”。
    作为美帝忠实走卒的日本佐藤政府的外务大臣三木，在会谈中一再表示希望苏修“使用它的影响”，“努力找出和平解决”越南战争的“办法”，并“敦促”苏修在裁军方面“积极地进行工作”。七月二十四日，在同葛罗米柯举行的会谈中，三木对葛罗米柯说，“消除局部战争是今后的课题”。而葛罗米柯回答说，“对于日本政府的想法，抱有同感”。据透露，结果双方一致表示“要尽可能快地解决越南战争问题”。此外，据三木二十三日对日本记者说，苏修“对防止扩散核武器”也“非常热心”。以上这些情况，明显地暴露了苏修叛徒集团在葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，企图更加丧心病狂地同美帝和各国反动派一起破坏和镇压世界被压迫人民的武装革命斗争。
    苏修和日本反动派，在这次会谈中还策划反华和反对亚洲人民的阴谋。据报道，苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫在同三木会谈时，公然攻击中国的外交政策。他表示，为了东南亚的所谓“安定”，苏修愿意同日本“合作”。三木则向苏方解释了日本参加“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的问题，要苏修“放心”。他说，参加美国一手策划的这个组织的“都是对中国抱有戒心的，而对苏联则没有敌意”。他说，日本“没有把苏联关在门外的意图”。“苏联也可以参加”美帝背后操纵的在亚洲进行经济掠夺的工具“亚洲开发银行和农业开发基金”，“以便同心合力开发亚洲”。
    为了讨好日本佐藤政府，发展苏日“合作”，柯西金之流还建议，苏日两国就缔结战后和约的问题进行谈判。多年来，苏联一直拒绝讨论日本提出的要苏联“归还”南千岛群岛的要求。然而，据透露，三木在这次会谈中已嗅到了苏联准备在这个问题上妥协的味道。同时，在这次会谈中，双方还进一步讨论了“联合开发西伯利亚”、莫斯科和东京通航、渔业合作等问题，最后签订了在渔业方面进行科学技术合作的协定，交换了苏日领事条约的批准书，并达成了柯西金和佐藤互访的决定。对于这些结果，日本方面是极为满意的。关于这一点，共同社记者二十二日自莫斯科报道说：“在日本方面看来，苏联的立场已比过去相当大地前进了一大步。”
