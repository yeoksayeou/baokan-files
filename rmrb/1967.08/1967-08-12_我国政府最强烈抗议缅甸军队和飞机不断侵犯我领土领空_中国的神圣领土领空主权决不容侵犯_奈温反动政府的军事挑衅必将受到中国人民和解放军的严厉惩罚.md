China's sacred territorial and airspace sovereignty will not be violated. The military provocations of the Ne Win reactionary government will be met with severe punishment from the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army.

	BEIJING, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the Myanmar Embassy in China, strongly exposing the repeated incursions by the Ne Win reactionary government into China's Yunnan region, conducting reconnaissance, harassment, and sabotage activities, and seriously violating China's sacred territorial and airspace sovereignty. The Chinese government has lodged the strongest protest against the Myanmar reactionary government.

	The note said that according to reports from China's border defense forces, from October 1966 to July 1967, Myanmar's military and aircraft repeatedly invaded China's Yunnan region, conducting reconnaissance, harassment, and sabotage activities. Incomplete statistics show that Myanmar aircraft invaded Chinese airspace six times, totaling 43 sorties; Myanmar troops fired across the border into Chinese territory twice; Myanmar armed forces crossed the border 20 times, totaling 263 personnel. In several instances, Myanmar soldiers invaded Chinese territory, looted Chinese civilians' property, beat, and even shot and injured Chinese civilians; sometimes they even deployed more than a hundred fully armed troops to invade Chinese territory, engaging in large-scale looting and arson.

	The annex to the note lists the details of Myanmar's military incursions into Chinese territory. Among the most serious incidents were:

	On November 9, 1966, around 11:00 AM, about 90 fully armed Myanmar soldiers, carrying a cannon, three light machine guns, and 11 horses, invaded Chinese territory from a hill near Longchuan County. Twenty-seven of them, carrying guns, entered the village of Shangdengsa, searched six households, and looted a firearm, a gun barrel, 50 yuan in Chinese currency, and other items. They left the invasion point around 11:40 AM, about 200 meters north of the original entry point, with a penetration depth of about 300 meters. During the search and looting, Myanmar soldiers also beat two Chinese civilians.

	On March 12, 1967, around 11:40 AM, about 60 fully armed Myanmar soldiers invaded Chinese territory near the 26th boundary marker, about 25 meters deep, and fired approximately 100 shots at two Chinese civilians, Yin Zhihai and Yang Siguang, who were resting nearby. Yin Zhihai was injured, with his left hand shattered.

	On March 26, 1967, at 3:30 PM, one fully armed Myanmar soldier invaded Chinese territory near the 81st boundary marker and forcibly took Chinese civilian Yuan Endian to Myanmar territory, where he was beaten.

	Annex II of the note lists incidents of Myanmar troops firing across the border into Chinese territory:

	On May 5, 1967, around 11:00 AM, about 20 fully armed Myanmar soldiers on the Myanmar side of the border near Manong Village fired across the border into Chinese territory in Ruili County. The same day, around 12:40 PM, about 100 Myanmar soldiers between the 31st and 32nd boundary markers fired across the border into Chinese territory, shooting for about an hour.

	Annex III of the note lists incidents of Myanmar aircraft invading Chinese airspace.

	The note said that in recent years, Myanmar's military and aircraft have repeatedly invaded Chinese territory and airspace. The Chinese government has repeatedly, on January 11 and May 11, 1965, February 12 and December 13, 1966, lodged serious protests with the Ne Win government, demanding that measures be taken to prevent further incursions. The Ne Win government has also acknowledged on multiple occasions that Myanmar troops have invaded Chinese territory and has assured the Chinese government that it would order Myanmar troops to respect the Sino-Myanmar border and not cross into Chinese territory. However, recent events have once again proven that the Ne Win government is a hypocritical and treacherous government. Despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government, it continues to dispatch armed forces to invade Chinese territory and airspace. It blatantly ignores the borders already defined by the governments of China and Myanmar, wantonly violating China's territorial and airspace sovereignty, threatening and disrupting the peace of China's border regions, and repeatedly provoking China militarily.

	The note pointed out that the Ne Win government's adoption of these serious hostile actions is not accidental. It is an important step for the Ne Win government to align with U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, acting as a key figure in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. Recently, the Ne Win government has further escalated its nationwide anti-China and anti-Chinese activities to the border regions near China. It not only arbitrarily arrests and brutally persecutes overseas Chinese and Chinese border residents but also continuously holds anti-China and anti-Chinese demonstrations in border regions, intensifies reconnaissance activities in China's border regions, and has even, on July 9 and July 21, openly dispatched armed soldiers to invade Chinese territory. This is another serious provocation against the Chinese people. The above facts fully prove that the Ne Win government is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people and deliberately create border tensions.

	The Chinese government, in the note, once again sternly warns the Ne Win government: The sacred territory and airspace of the People's Republic of China will not be violated. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The severe military provocations by the Ne Win government of Myanmar against the Chinese people will be met with severe punishment from the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army.

    我国政府最强烈抗议缅甸军队和飞机不断侵犯我领土领空
    中国的神圣领土领空主权决不容侵犯
    奈温反动政府的军事挑衅必将受到中国人民和解放军的严厉惩罚
    新华社十一日讯　中国外交部十一日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，严正揭露缅甸奈温反动政府连续不断地派遣军队和飞机侵入中国云南地区，进行侦察、骚扰和破坏活动，严重侵犯中国神圣领土、领空主权的军事挑衅行为。对此，中国政府向缅甸反动政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，据中国边防部队报告，一九六六年十月至一九六七年七月，缅甸军队和飞机连续不断地侵入中国云南地区，进行侦察、骚扰和破坏活动。据不完全统计，缅甸飞机侵入中国境内共六起，四十三架次；缅甸军队从境外向中国境内开枪挑衅二起；缅甸武装部队越境共二十起，二百六十三人次。其中有几起缅甸士兵侵入中国境内，抢劫中国边民财物，殴打甚至开枪打伤中国边民；有时竟出动上百名全副武装的部队，侵入中国境内，大肆进行抢劫烧杀。
    照会的附件列举了缅甸军队侵入中国境内情况。其中特别严重的是：
    一九六六年十一月九日十一时左右，缅甸士兵九十余人，全副武装，带炮一门、轻机枪三挺、骡马十一匹，从中国陇川县内一高地附近侵入中国境内。其中二十七人持枪进入该县上等撒寨，对六户群众进行搜查，并抢走该寨居民的火药枪一支、枪管一支、人民币五十元及其它财物，于十一时四十分左右从原入侵地点以北二百米处出境，越境纵深约三百米。缅甸士兵在搜查、抢劫时，还殴打中国边民二人。
    一九六七年三月十二日十一时四十分左右，缅甸士兵六十余人，全副武装，在二十六号界桩附近侵入中国境内约二十五米，并向正在该处附近休息的中国边民尹志海、杨四光二人开枪射击，约一百发，中国边民尹志海中弹受伤，左手被打断。
    一九六七年三月二十六日十五时三十分，缅甸士兵一人，全副武装，从八十一号界桩附近侵入中国境内，并强行将中国边民阮恩干带到缅境，进行殴打。
    照会的附件二列举了缅甸军队隔界向我境射击情况：
    一九六七年五月五日十一时左右，缅甸士兵二十余人，全副武装，在缅境曼允寨公路上，隔界向中国瑞丽县境内鸣枪挑衅。同日十二时四十分，缅甸士兵约一百余人，在三十一至三十二号界桩之间，隔界向我境开枪挑衅，射击达一小时之久。
    照会的附件三列举了缅甸飞机侵入中国领空的情况。
    照会说，近几年来，缅甸军队和飞机不断侵入中国领土和领空。对此，中国政府先后于一九六五年一月十一日和五月十一日，一九六六年二月十二日和十二月十三日多次向奈温政府提出严正交涉，要求采取措施，防止再次发生入侵事件。奈温政府也不止一次地承认缅甸军队入侵的事实，并向中国政府保证，将下令缅甸部队尊重中缅边界，不得越入中国境内。但是近几个月来的事实再一次证明，奈温政府是一个口是心非、背信弃义的政府。它不顾中国政府的一再警告，继续不断地派遣武装力量侵入中国领土和领空。它居然无视中缅两国政府早已划定的两国边界，恣意侵犯中国的领土领空主权，威胁和破坏中国边境地区的安宁，一再向中国人民进行军事挑衅。
    照会指出，奈温政府采取这些严重的敌对行动绝不是偶然的。这是奈温政府投靠美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，充当反华排华急先锋的一个重要步骤。最近奈温政府把它掀起的全国规模反华排华高潮，更进一步地推向靠近中国的边境地区，它不仅大肆逮捕和残暴迫害华侨和中国边民，接连在边境地区举行反华排华示威游行，加紧对中国边境地区的侦察活动，而且又在七月九日和七月二十一日两次公然派遣武装士兵侵入中国境内，这是对中国人民的又一次严重挑衅。以上事实充分证明，奈温政府决心与中国人民为敌，蓄意制造边境紧张局势。
    中国政府在照会中再次严正警告奈温政府：中华人民共和国的神圣领土、领空决不容许侵犯，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的。缅甸奈温政府对中国人民进行的严重军事挑衅，必将受到中国人民和中国人民解放军的严厉惩罚。
