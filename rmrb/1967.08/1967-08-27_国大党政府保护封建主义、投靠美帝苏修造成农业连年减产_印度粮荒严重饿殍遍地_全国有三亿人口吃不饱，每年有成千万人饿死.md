The Indian National Congress government's protection of feudalism and alignment with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have led to consecutive years of agricultural decline. Famine in India is severe, with corpses littering the streets. Across the nation, 300 million people are starving, and every year, millions die of hunger.

New China News Agency reports: Our correspondent reports that India's famine is becoming increasingly severe. On July 6, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi admitted at a meeting of chief ministers of the various states that India's food situation has reached an "extremely difficult" state. Currently, the food crisis has not only become an important marker of India's increasingly paralyzed economy but is also considered a major issue driving India's political instability and class struggle.

According to reports, in the agricultural year that ended in June, India's total grain production is estimated to be at most 76 million tons. Indian Food Minister Ram admitted that even if the total production reaches this figure, "it is approximately 12 million tons short of the country's needs," which is a significantly reduced figure compared to the actual shortage. In the coming months, India will face a period when grain supply is scarce. New grain will not be available until December, and the government lacks grain reserves, so the supply of grain will depend on the amount of imported grain.

India's natural conditions are originally very favorable for agricultural production. However, due to the Indian National Congress government's implementation of reactionary policies to protect feudalism domestically and collude with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism internationally, agricultural production has been severely damaged. For a long time, India has not been self-sufficient in food, and there has been a famine of varying degrees almost every year. Since 1960, India's grain production has fluctuated around 80 million tons. Since 1962, when the Indian government launched a large-scale military invasion of China and expanded military preparations, India's grain production has declined for three consecutive years, while the amount of grain imported from abroad, mainly from the United States, has increased every year, reaching over 10 million tons last year. By the end of 1965, India had purchased a total of 3,700 million tons of grain from the United States, valued at over 11.1 billion rupees. Relying on imported grain to solve the famine is like drinking poison to quench thirst. The dumping of U.S. grain has further damaged India's grain production. In 1964, India finally experienced an unprecedented severe nationwide famine. Indian newspapers revealed in August 1965 that out of India's 500 million population, nearly 300 million people were not getting enough to eat. According to Agence France-Presse's December message that year, India has one million people dying of hunger every year. The situation has become more severe this year. Even the Indian "Link" weekly had to admit: "Hunger is ominously threatening the entire country from the southern state of Kerala to the northern state of Bihar." More and more poor people are surviving by eating tree bark and grass roots, and deaths from starvation are occurring everywhere.

In Bihar, the state government was forced to officially declare in April that about one-third of the state is facing a severe famine. Currently, out of the state's 50 million population, at least 40 million are starving. The "Indian Times" reported on the situation in this region: "The worst famine of the century has reduced millions of people to walking skeletons." "They are on the brink of death."

The situation in the other 15 states of India is similar. In West Bengal, the grain distribution system of the so-called "non-Congress government" has collapsed. Out of the 38 million population, at least 27 million are starving. In 43 counties of Madhya Pradesh, 38 counties are facing severe famine. Some regions of Uttar Pradesh are also facing severe famine.

On the other hand, Indian landlords, the bourgeoisie, and the reactionary officials of the Indian government are indifferent to the suffering of the broad masses of people, indulging in debauchery and extravagance every day, and indulging in every kind of luxury. Speculators are taking advantage of the famine to hoard and profiteer, making huge fortunes.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The broad masses of the Indian people, who are on the brink of hunger and death, are constantly rising up to resist the evil rule of the Indian reactionary government. In recent periods, there have been many incidents of looting government grain in various places in India. Particularly exciting is that the peasants in the Nasalbari region of Darjeeling County, India, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have launched an organized armed peasant struggle. They have established red areas, fought against landlords, distributed land, abolished hoarding, and resisted the military and police "suppression." The revolutionary actions of the peasants in the Darjeeling region have set an example for the broad masses of the Indian people. (Attached picture)

Under the brutal oppression and bone-sucking exploitation of the Indian National Congress reactionary government, the broad masses of the Indian people are facing the threat of severe famine. They gnaw on tree bark and eat grass roots, but still cannot fill their stomachs. Emaciated children and adults with empty stomachs struggle on the brink of death.

### 国大党政府保护封建主义、投靠美帝苏修造成农业连年减产  印度粮荒严重饿殍遍地  全国有三亿人口吃不饱，每年有成千万人饿死

    国大党政府保护封建主义、投靠美帝苏修造成农业连年减产
    印度粮荒严重饿殍遍地
    全国有三亿人口吃不饱，每年有成千万人饿死
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：印度的粮荒越来越严重。印度总理英迪拉·甘地七月六日在各邦首席部长会议上不得不承认：印度的粮食状况已面临“极端困难”的境地。目前，粮食危机不仅已经成为印度经济日益瘫痪的重要标志，而且被认为是促使印度政局动荡、阶级斗争激化的重大问题。
    据报道，在今年六月份刚刚结束的上一个农业年度，印度粮食总产量估计至多只能达到七千六百万吨。印度粮食部长拉姆承认，即使总产量达到这个数字，“比国家的需要大约缺一千二百万吨”，这还是比实际缺粮数大大缩小了的数字。今后几个月，是印度粮食青黄不接的季节。新谷要到十二月份才上市，政府又缺乏贮备粮，粮食的供应将取决于进口粮食的多少。
    印度的自然条件本来对农业生产非常有利。但由于印度国大党政府执行对内保护封建主义、对外勾结美帝和苏修的反动政策，严重地摧残了农业生产。长期以来印度粮食不能自给自足，几乎每年都要发生不同程度的粮荒。从一九六○年以来，印度每年粮食产量一直徘徊在八千万吨上下，自一九六二年印度政府悍然发动对中国的大规模军事侵略，并大肆扩军备战之后，印度粮食连续三年减产，而从国外，主要是从美国进口的粮食连年增加，去年高达一千万吨以上。到一九六五年底，印度向美国买的粮食总共有三千七百多万吨，价值一百十一亿多卢比。靠进口粮食解决粮荒，无异饮鸩止渴。美国粮食的倾销，又进一步摧残了印度的粮食生产。一九六四年印度终于爆发了空前严重的全国性大粮荒。印度报纸在一九六五年八月间曾经透露，印度五亿人口中将近有三亿人吃不饱。据法新社同年十二月的消息说，印度每年总有一千万人饿死。今年以来，情况更加严重。连印度《联系》周刊也不得不承认：“饥饿正在阴森森地威胁着从南方的喀拉拉邦到北方的比哈尔邦的整个国家。”越来越多的穷人靠吃树皮、草根过活，饿死人的事到处发生。
    在比哈尔邦，邦政府四月间已被迫正式宣布这个邦的大约三分之一地区存在严重饥荒状况。目前，在这个邦五千万人口中，至少已有四千万人挨饿。《印度时报》在报道这个地区的情况时说：“本世纪最严重的饥荒使得数以百万计的人瘦成了走动着的骷髅。”“他们已处在死亡的边缘。”
    印度其它十五个邦的情况也差不多。在西孟加拉邦，所谓“非国大党政府”的粮食分配制度已经瓦解。三千八百万人口中，至少有二千七百万人挨饿。中央邦四十三个县，有三十八个县面临着严重的饥荒。北方邦的一些地区，粮荒情况也一直严重。
    另一方面，印度的地主、资产阶级和印度反动政府的官僚政客，却无视广大人民的疾苦，终日花天酒地、荒淫无耻，极尽穷奢极欲之能事。投机奸商更乘粮荒的机会，囤积居奇，投机倒把，大发横财。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。处于饥饿、死亡线上的印度广大人民，不断奋起反抗印度反动政府的罪恶统治。最近一个时期，印度许多地方都发生抢劫政府粮食的事件。尤其令人兴奋的是，印度大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区的农民，在印共革命派的领导下，掀起了有组织的农民武装斗争。他们建立了红色地区，打土豪，分田地，取缔囤积居奇，反击军警“进剿”。大吉岭地区农民的革命行动，为印度广大人民树立了榜样。（附图片）
    在印度国大党反动政府的残酷压迫和敲骨吸髓的剥削下，印度广大人民面临严重粮荒的威胁。他们啃树皮、吃草根，也填不饱肚皮。骨瘦如柴的孩子和腹无粒米的成年人挣扎在死亡线上。
