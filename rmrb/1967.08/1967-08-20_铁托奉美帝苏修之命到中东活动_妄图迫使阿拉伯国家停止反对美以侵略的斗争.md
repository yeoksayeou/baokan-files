In accordance with the instructions of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, the traitor Tito conducted intense activities in the Middle East from August 10 to 17, attempting to force Arab countries to abandon their struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

This double agent of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists first went to Cairo to hold talks with President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, then rushed to Damascus and Baghdad to hold talks with the presidents of Syria and Iraq, and finally returned to the United Arab Republic for another secret meeting with Nasser.

Tito was sent to the Middle East to carry out activities at the behest of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists. The Associated Press revealed that at the end of July, "Tito received a personal letter from President Johnson regarding the Middle East issue. This letter...discussed Tito's possible role in peace efforts in the complex Middle East situation." According to the Egyptian weekly *Ruz al-Yusuf*, Tito's activities in the Middle East were decided at a meeting in Moscow, where the Soviet revisionists gathered a small group of their Eastern European followers. Additionally, according to the Indian News Agency, just minutes before boarding his plane in Belgrade to fly to Cairo, Tito received an urgent telegram from Kosygin regarding the Middle East issue.

According to Western news agencies, Tito's main task this time was to force Arab countries to accept a "secret agreement" reached between Kosygin and Johnson during their secret talks in Glassboro. The essence of this agreement is to make Arab countries concede, effectively recognizing Israel; to make the Arab people stop their struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression; and to have the United Nations "guarantee" a so-called "political solution."

Before leaving the United Arab Republic to return home on August 17, Tito issued a statement regarding his activities, insidiously advocating for the use of political means to resolve the current Middle East crisis.

### 铁托奉美帝苏修之命到中东活动  妄图迫使阿拉伯国家停止反对美以侵略的斗争

    铁托奉美帝苏修之命到中东活动
    妄图迫使阿拉伯国家停止反对美以侵略的斗争
    据新华社十八日讯　在美帝国主义和苏修领导集团指使下，叛徒铁托从八月十日至十七日到中东进行了紧张的活动，妄图迫使阿拉伯国家放弃继续反对美以侵略的斗争。
    这个美帝和苏修的双料走狗先到开罗同阿联总统纳赛尔会谈，然后跑到大马士革和巴格达同叙利亚和伊拉克的总统会谈，最后又回到阿联同纳赛尔再度秘密会谈。
    铁托是奉了美帝和苏修的意旨去中东活动的。美联社透露，在七月底，“铁托收到了约翰逊总统关于中东问题的一封私人信。这封信……谈到铁托在复杂的中东局势中可能承担的和平作用。”据阿联《鲁兹·优素福》周刊报道，铁托去中东活动是在苏修纠集它的一小撮东欧追随者在莫斯科举行的一次会议上决定的。另据印度报业托辣斯透露，铁托在贝尔格莱德上飞机去开罗之前几分钟，还接到柯西金有关中东问题的一封急电。
    据西方通讯社透露，铁托这次去中东，主要任务是迫使阿拉伯国家接受柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗秘密会谈时所达成的一项“秘密协议”。这个协议的实质就是要阿拉伯国家让步，实际上承认以色列；要阿拉伯人民停止反对美以侵略的斗争；由联合国出面“保证”，进行所谓“政治解决”。
    铁托在十七日离开阿联回国之前，就他的这次活动发表了一项声明，别有用心地大力鼓吹“用政治办法来解决目前的中东危机”。
