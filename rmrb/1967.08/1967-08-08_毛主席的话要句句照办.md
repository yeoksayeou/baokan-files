One year has passed since the issuance of the "Sixteen Points." This is an important historical document personally overseen by Chairman Mao, representing a new manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has made us deeply feel the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. At every critical moment in the struggle, when we encounter difficulties, and when our very existence is at stake, Chairman Mao has always been with us, fighting alongside us, timely pointing out the general direction of our struggle, giving us immense encouragement and strength, and leading us forward bravely.

Over the past year, when we enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and opened fire on the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Party who are taking the capitalist road, our revolutionary forces have suffered two brutal suppressions. The first occurred in the over fifty days starting in early June last year, when the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Party who are taking the capitalist road manipulated conservative organizations to label many revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "monsters and demons." At that time, we proletarian revolutionaries absolutely believed that Chairman Mao would support us: "Chairman Mao is always with us, Chairman Mao is right by our side." Therefore, we were fearless, undaunted, and never bowed our heads.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, personally overseen by the Party, sentenced the bourgeois reactionary line to death, sentenced the bourgeois headquarters to death, and pointed out the path to victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The publication of the Eighth Plenary Session communiqué and the "Sixteen Points" made our broad masses of revolutionary comrades who had been persecuted shed tears of joy. We, this batch of "counter-revolutionaries" and "monsters and demons," broke through the white terror, shattered all shackles, and with a thousandfold more ferocious force, launched another attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The January Revolution storm swept the nation, and we "August 18th" revolutionaries also seized back all the power that had been usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Party who are taking the capitalist road. At this time, the class enemies became even more frantic. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road colluded with a batch of counter-revolutionaries and monsters and demons, launching a February counter-revolutionary restoration tide, and conducting another brutal suppression of the "August 18th" revolutionaries. In the thirty-four days of blood and wind, we "August 18th" revolutionaries did not bow our heads or waver. We were full of confidence in the future, and we repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Darkness is about to pass, dawn is ahead."

Just as the Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries were suffering another severe setback, our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, "rehabilitated" us again. We "August 18th" revolutionaries, once again under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, raised the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, delivering a fatal blow to the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Two waves of white terror caused many twists and turns and difficulties for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai. However, because we have the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have always been invincible and unstoppable. Listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao will give us boundless strength. Each victory in the struggle, every step forward, makes us understand more deeply the immense greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and feel more intimately the warmth of each word from Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's words must be listened to at all times, every sentence must be followed, and everything must be done according to his instructions. This is our highest principle.

I remember, in late March, when Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee had just "rehabilitated" us, some comrades who had suffered severe persecution by counter-revolutionaries also thought: "We must vent our anger later." However, we did not do this. We mobilized the broad masses of "August 18th" revolutionary soldiers to repeatedly study the "Sixteen Points" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," making everyone realize that a true proletarian revolutionary must be a model of listening to Chairman Mao's words, absolutely not replacing the Party's policy with personal feelings, and even less interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of correctly handling the deceived masses and uniting the majority. If we treat the deceived masses with the methods used against enemies, we will push these people into the enemy's arms. Therefore, after our "rehabilitation," the "August 18th" revolutionaries not only did not take revenge, but many comrades who had suffered severe persecution also found the general masses who had persecuted them, did political and ideological work, helped them recognize their mistakes, and mobilized them to turn back and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As a result, the broad masses who had been deceived flocked to us, and many joined the "August 18th" revolutionary organization, completely isolating a handful of counter-revolutionaries and a handful of bad leaders from the original conservative organizations, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai advance smoothly once again. This is also an important guarantee for the current Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries to launch a great criticism and great struggle against the biggest power-holders within the Party and the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Party who are taking the capitalist road with the momentum of overturning mountains and rivers and the spirit of beating a fallen enemy.

Chairman Mao has warned us: "Because of victory, arrogance within the Party, the mood of considering oneself a meritorious subject, ... may grow." When our "August 18th" revolutionary forces were at their strongest, we were also hit by sectarianism, individualism, mountainism, and anarchism, almost causing a crisis of unity within the revolutionary forces. But we did not split, nor did we fight a civil war. The reason we did not is that our leadership core timely conducted a rectification campaign. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," everyone openly discussed, had heart-to-heart talks, and actively engaged in self-criticism, eliminating differences. Precisely because all our actions do not deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings, the leadership core has a unified will, so whether in the days of arduous struggle or in the days of great victory, our revolutionary forces have always been united.

Looking back at the struggles of the past year, we face the future with unshakable confidence. The victories we have achieved are not the merits of the "August 18th" revolutionaries, but the victories of the "Sixteen Points" personally overseen by Chairman Mao, the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A more arduous struggle lies ahead, and the road of struggle is still long. In the future, we will always remember one thing: Chairman Mao's words must be listened to sentence by sentence, understood and followed, and even if not understood, they must still be followed. With this, we will truly be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and we will be able to move from victory to victory!

    毛主席的话要句句照办
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会负责人　刘明乾　马集文　王中山　隆光前
    “十六条”发表一周年了。这是毛主席亲自主持制定的重要的历史文件，是毛泽东思想的新的体现。一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命斗争的实践，使我们深深地感到毛泽东思想的威力无比强大。在斗争的每一个关键时刻，在我们遇到困难的时候，在我们生死存亡的关头，毛主席总是同我们生活在一起、战斗在一起，及时地给我们指明斗争的大方向，给我们以巨大的鼓舞和力量，率领我们奋勇前进。
    在过去的一年多的时间里，当我们热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，向青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火的时候，我们的革命队伍曾先后遭到过两次残酷的镇压。第一次，是在去年六月初开始的五十多天的时间里，青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派操纵保守组织，把许多革命群众打成了“反革命”和“牛鬼蛇神”。这时，我们无产阶级革命派绝对相信毛主席是会支持我们的：“毛主席时刻同我们在一起，毛主席就在我们的身边”。所以，我们没有畏惧，没有丧气，绝不低头。
    毛主席亲自主持的党的八届十一中全会，宣判了资产阶级反动路线的死刑，宣判了资产阶级司令部的死刑，指明了无产阶级文化大革命走向胜利的道路。八届十一中全会公报和“十六条”的公布，使我们广大受迫害的革命群众激动地流出了热泪。我们这一批“反革命”和“牛鬼蛇神”冲破了白色恐怖，打破了一切束缚，以比过去猛烈千百倍的火力，又一次向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了进攻。“一月革命”风暴席卷全国，我们“八·一八”革命派也夺了被青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺去的一切大权。这时，阶级敌人变得更加疯狂了。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派勾结一批反革命分子和牛鬼蛇神，掀起了二月反革命复辟逆流，对“八·一八”革命派进行了又一次残酷的镇压。在腥风血雨的三十四天里，我们“八·一八”革命派毫不低头，毫不动摇。我们对未来充满了信心，我们反复朗诵毛主席语录：“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”。
    正当青海省无产阶级革命派又一次遭受严重挫折的时候，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席又为我们“平反”了。我们“八·一八”革命派，再一次在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，更高地举起革命的批判大旗，给青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以致命的打击。
    两次白色恐怖，给青海省的无产阶级文化大革命造成了许多曲折和困难。但是，由于我们有毛泽东思想的指导，我们一直是战无不胜、所向无敌的。听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，就会有无穷无尽的力量。每一次斗争的胜利，每前进一步，都使我们更深一步地领会到毛泽东思想的无比伟大，更觉得毛主席每一句话的亲切。
    毛主席的话时时要听，句句要听，事事照办，这就是我们的最高原则。
    记得，三月下旬毛主席和党中央刚刚为我们“平反”的时候，受过反革命分子严重迫害的一些同志也曾想过：“以后非出出气不可”。但是，我们没有这样做。我们发动“八·一八”革命派广大战士，反复学习了“十六条”和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，使大家认识到：一个真正的无产阶级革命派必须成为听毛主席话的模范，绝不能以自己的感情代替党的政策，更不应该以个人的恩怨干扰毛主席的关于正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，团结大多数的伟大战略思想。如果用对待敌人的办法去对待受蒙蔽的群众，就会把这些人推到敌人的怀里去。因此，我们“八·一八”革命派在“平反”以后，不但没有发生报复的行动，许多遭受过严重迫害的“八·一八”战士，还找到那些迫害过自己的一般群众，做政治思想工作，帮助他们认识错误，动员他们大杀回马枪，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。结果，广大受蒙蔽的群众纷纷向我们靠拢，有不少人还参加了“八·一八”革命组织，把一小撮反革命分子和原保守组织中的一小撮坏头头彻底地孤立起来，使青海省无产阶级文化大革命又顺利地向前迈进了一大步。这也是目前青海省无产阶级革命派能够以排山倒海之势和以痛打落水狗的精神，向党内最大的和青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大批判、大斗争的重要保证。
    毛主席曾经告诫我们说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，……可能生长。”当我们“八·一八”革命派的队伍空前壮大的时候，我们也曾受到过小团体主义、个人主义、山头主义、无政府主义的冲击，几乎使革命队伍内部的团结发生危机。但我们并没有分裂，没有打内战。其所以会这样，是因为我们的领导核心及时地进行了整风。大家在学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作后，相互之间开诚布公，相互谈心，主动进行自我批评，消除了分歧。正由于我们一切行动不离开毛主席的教导，领导核心有了统一的意志，所以无论在艰苦斗争的日子里，还是在取得伟大胜利的时候，我们革命派内部始终是团结的。
    回顾一年多来的斗争，使我们信心百倍地面对着未来。我们所取得的胜利，并不是我们“八·一八”革命派的功劳，而是毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。更艰巨的斗争任务还在前面，斗争的道路还长得很。我们今后将永远记住一条：毛主席的话句句要听，理解的要照办，不理解的也要照办。有了这一条，我们才不愧为毛主席的好战士，我们才能从胜利走向胜利！
