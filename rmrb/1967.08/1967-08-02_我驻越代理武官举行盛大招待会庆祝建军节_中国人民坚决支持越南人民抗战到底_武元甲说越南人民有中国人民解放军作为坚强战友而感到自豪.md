	Chinese Deputy Military Attaché Clam Cloud Terrace held a grand reception on July 31 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Invited to attend the reception were: General Vo Nguyen Giap, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, Deputy Minister of Defense Nguyen Chi Thanh, Deputy Chief of the General Political Department of the People's Army Le Quang Dao, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Van Thuan and Nguyen Ky Tho, as well as heads of various government departments, heads of various general departments, military branches, and armed forces, and combat heroes.

	The representative of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, Nguyen Phu Tho, also attended the reception.

	Clam Cloud Terrace and General Vo Nguyen Giap both spoke at the reception.

	Clam Cloud Terrace said in his speech, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great revolutionary army created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. Our army has now developed into the strongest revolutionary army in the world, a pillar of our proletarian dictatorship, and a strong force for defending peace in Asia and the world."

	He said, "Over the past 40 years, our army has grown stronger and achieved one victory after another, primarily because it is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and has vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, implementing Chairman Mao's military line. Our broad cadre and soldiers are resolutely responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, determined to build our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

	Clam Cloud Terrace said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has already achieved decisive victories. He said, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are terrified and hateful of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but their anti-China tide will not harm a single hair of the Chinese people; it will only backfire. Our people are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and to build our country into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color. We will definitely liberate Taiwan. We will always be vigilant and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all enemies who dare to invade."

	He said, "The helmsman of our revolution and the world revolution is Chairman Mao. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's military thought is the most complete, most thorough, most systematic, and greatest military theory in the history of Marxism, the highest peak of contemporary Marxist-Leninist military theory."

	Clam Cloud Terrace enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said, "Now, the U.S. imperialists are still unwilling to accept their defeat in the Vietnam War and are still trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender through strengthened military action and counter-revolutionary 'peace' talks. Modern revisionists, in order to meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists, are doing their utmost to help. For years, they have been working in concert with the U.S. imperialists, not only betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people but also betraying the interests of revolutionary people around the world. However, all their wild dreams will never come true. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call has already expressed the iron will and determination of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation. We believe that the Vietnamese military and people will be more united, fearless of hardships and sacrifices, and will fight to the end until they achieve complete victory."

	He said, "The military and people of China and Vietnam are brothers who depend on each other. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation as their sacred internationalist duty. We have already made all preparations and are closely watching the developments in Vietnam. We are ready to take necessary actions at any time according to the requirements of the Vietnamese government and people. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists escalate their aggressive war, no matter how wide they spread the flames of aggression, and no matter how hard their running dogs and accomplices work for them, the Chinese people are determined to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end."

	General Vo Nguyen Giap said in his speech, "Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong at its helm, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has, after 40 years of fighting and building, written a glorious chapter in history and achieved unparalleled military feats."

	Vo Nguyen Giap said, "Recently, China successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. This great victory marks the extremely rapid progress of China's nuclear science and technology, which has played a major role in consolidating the national defense of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it is a great encouragement to the cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and to the revolutionary struggle of people around the world against imperialism. Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become the strongest revolutionary army in the world, with a high level of political awareness and military technology, ready at any time to smash all the conspiracies of the imperialists, led by U.S. imperialism, to expand their aggressive war."

	He said, "The glorious victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army make the enemy afraid and make friends around the world rejoice. The Vietnamese armed forces are proud to have the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army as their steadfast comrade-in-arms."

	Vo Nguyen Giap enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between Vietnam and China. He said, "The great support and help from the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army have strongly inspired the fighting spirit of our military and people and effectively strengthened our national defense. On this occasion, we express our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the brotherly Chinese Party, government, people, and People's Liberation Army."

	Vo Nguyen Giap then spoke about the glorious victories achieved by the people of North and South Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said, "The glorious victories of the people of North and South Vietnam prove the indomitable fighting spirit and the overwhelming fighting unity of the Vietnamese people."

	He said, "U.S. imperialism is now in a desperate situation, at a loss in politics, military strategy, and tactics. However, due to its warlike nature, it has not yet abandoned its ambition to invade Vietnam. Facing the vicious plots of U.S. imperialism, the Vietnamese military and people are increasingly maintaining and strengthening their fighting resolve, actively implementing the sacred call of our beloved leader Chairman Ho to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation, and resolutely pushing the people's war against the U.S. aggressors to the final victory."

	Vo Nguyen Giap said, "No matter how fierce the war is, no matter how much hardship we have to endure, no matter how much sacrifice we have to make, the Vietnamese nation and people will resolutely fight to the end, thoroughly defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately reunify the country, making due contributions to the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism."

	The reception was filled with the atmosphere of fighting friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam.

    武元甲说越南人民有中国人民解放军作为坚强战友而感到自豪
    据新华社河内一日电  中国驻越南大使馆代理武官袁云楼七月三十一日举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十周年。
    应邀出席招待会的有：越南劳动党中央政治局委员、政府副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，国防部副部长陈贵海少将，人民军总政治局副主任黎光道少将，越南外交部副部长黄文进、阮基石以及政府各部门负责人、人民军各总部、各军种、兵种负责人和战斗英雄等。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团代理团长阮富帅应邀出席了招待会。
    袁云楼代理武官和武元甲大将先后在招待会上讲话。
    袁云楼在讲话中说，中国人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接指挥下的伟大的革命军队。我军现在已发展成为世界上最强大的革命军队，成为我国无产阶级专政的柱石和保卫亚洲和世界和平的坚强力量。
    他说，四十年来，我军之所以能够不断成长壮大，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，最根本的就是由于它无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，大力突出无产阶级政治，贯彻了毛主席建军路线的结果。我军广大干部战士，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，正在掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，决心把我军建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    袁云楼说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。他说，帝、修、反对我国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要命，恨得要死，他们掀起的反华逆流损伤不了中国人民的一根毫毛，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。我国人民决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把我国建设成为无产阶级的永不变色的铁打江山。我们一定要解放台湾。我们一定时刻提高警惕，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    他说，大海航行靠舵手。我国革命和世界革命的舵手就是毛主席。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛主席的军事思想，是马克思主义发展史上最完整、最彻底、最系统、最伟大的军事理论，是当代马克思列宁主义军事学说的最高峰。
    袁云楼热烈赞扬越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的伟大胜利。他说，现在美帝国主义还不甘心于它在侵越战争中的失败，仍然妄图通过加强玩弄战、“和”反革命两手，迫使越南人民屈膝投降。现代修正主义为适应美帝的需要，大帮其忙。几年来他们一直在同美帝大搞“一致行动”，他们不仅出卖越南人民的利益而且也叛卖世界革命人民的利益。但是，它们的一切痴心妄想是永远不会得逞的。胡志明主席的伟大号召早已表达了越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。我们相信，兄弟的越南军民将会更加团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    他说，中越两国军民是唇齿相依的兄弟和战友。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己神圣的国际主义义务，我们早已做好了一切准备，正在密切注视越南形势的发展。随时准备根据越南政府和人民的要求，采取必要的行动。不论美帝国主义把侵略战争升多少级，把侵略战火扩大到多大范围，也不论它的走狗、帮凶们如何起劲地替它卖力，中国人民都决心把支持越南人民的伟大抗美救国战争进行到底。
    武元甲大将在讲话中说，在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，中国人民解放军经过四十年的战斗和建军，写下了辉煌的史页，建立了无比显赫的战功。
    武元甲说，最近中国成功地试验了氢弹。这一巨大胜利标志着中国人民核科学技术的非常迅速的进步，它对巩固中华人民共和国的国防力量起了重大的作用，同时也是对越南人民的抗美救国事业和全世界人民反对帝国主义的革命斗争事业的巨大鼓舞。今天，中国人民解放军已经成为世界上最强大的革命军队，具有高度的政治觉悟，具有很高的军事技术水平，随时准备粉碎以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义扩大侵略战争的一切阴谋。
    他说，中国人民解放军的辉煌胜利，使敌人害怕，使世界上的朋友欢欣鼓舞。越南人民武装力量为有着英雄的中国人民解放军作为自己的坚强战友而感到无比自豪。
    武元甲热烈颂扬了越中两国的战斗友谊。他说，中国人民和人民解放军对越南人民的巨大支持和帮助，强有力地鼓舞了我们军民的战斗精神，切实地加强了我们国家的国防力量。值此机会，我们谨向兄弟的中国党、政府、人民和人民解放军，表达越南党、政府、人民和人民武装力量的真诚和衷心的感谢。
    武元甲接着谈到越南南北两方人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利。他说，越南南北两方人民的辉煌胜利，证明了越南人民坚强不屈的战斗精神和移山倒海的战斗团结力量。
    他说，美帝国主义正处于窘迫的困境，在政治、军事、战略和战术上一筹莫展。但是由于它的好战本性，它仍然没有放弃侵略越南的野心。面对着美帝国主义的恶毒阴谋，越南军民日益保持和增强战斗决心，积极实现我们敬爱的领袖胡主席的抗美救国神圣号召，坚决把反对美帝国主义侵略者的人民战争推进到最后胜利。
    武元甲说，不管战争多么激烈，不管要忍受多大艰苦，要付出多大牺牲，越南民族和越南人民也要坚决战斗到底，彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国，为世界人民争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的革命斗争事业作出应有的贡献。
    招待会始终洋溢着中越两国人民、两国军队之间的战斗友谊和战斗团结的气氛。
