Lao People's Liberation Army Attacks Enemy Command Post

In the recent anti-American national salvation war, patriotic military personnel and civilians in various liberated areas of Laos have continuously achieved new victories.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, local forces and guerrilla units in the liberated areas of Vientiane Province recently infiltrated the town of Kasi County and launched a fierce attack on the command post of a fake army battalion. They killed four American aggressors and seventeen fake soldiers on the spot. In the chaos, the enemy fired at each other, killing eight and wounding two.

Two Thousand Bolivian Miners Strike

The indefinite general strike by 2,000 tin miners in the southwestern regions of Cochabamba and Tarama in Bolivia, which began on the 22nd, is still ongoing. The striking workers are protesting the dictatorial regime's stubborn refusal to meet their demands made several months ago: to reinstate workers who were fired for political reasons; to release arrested and persecuted workers; and to raise wages. The strike has received public support.

Indian Prime Minister Attends Dog's Funeral

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi attended the funeral of a dog beloved by her father Nehru on the 22nd.

The amount of money that Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and their ilk spend on keeping dogs in a single day is enough to feed many poor people. Meanwhile, in Bihar, in Uttar Pradesh, and in other places, people are eating tree bark and grass roots, entire villages are starving to death, and corpses are left in the wild to be eaten by birds and beasts.

The Indian people cannot expect bureaucratic politicians like Indira Gandhi, who love dogs, to improve their lives. Only by taking up arms like the farmers of Naxalbari and fighting resolutely can they achieve this!

    老挝各解放区爱国军民在最近的抗美救国战争中，不断取得新战绩。

    玻利维亚两千矿工举行罢工
    玻利维亚西南部的克奇斯拉和特拉马尤地区的两千名锡矿工人从二十二日开始举行的不定期总罢工仍在坚持中。罢工工人抗议独裁政权顽固地拒绝他们几个月前提出的要求：恢复由于政治原因而被解雇的工人的工作；释放被捕和被迫害的工人；提高工资。罢工得到公众舆论的支持。
    印度总理竟出席狗的葬礼
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地二十二日出席了她父亲尼赫鲁所钟爱的一条狗的葬礼。
    尼赫鲁、英迪拉·甘地之流一天养狗的钱，足够许多穷人的吃用。而在比哈尔邦，在北方邦，在其它地方，人们在吃草根树皮，整村整村的人饿死，尸体暴露在野地里，被鸟兽吞食。
    印度人民决不能期望象英迪拉·甘地那样爱狗的官僚政客去改善人民的生活，而只有象纳萨尔巴里的农民一样，拿起武器，坚决斗争！
