Revolutionary masses across the country enthusiastically study the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine and vow to better love and learn from the People's Liberation Army, standing shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the army, fighting together to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 20, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country have enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorial "The Great Chinese People's Liberation Army is the Reliable Pillar of Our Proletarian Dictatorship and Proletarian Cultural Revolution" in the *Red Flag* magazine. During discussions and study sessions on this editorial, they expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to raise high the banner of supporting the army, to love and protect the People's Liberation Army, to maintain the army's lofty prestige, and to sincerely assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" work. They vowed to forever stand together with the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, fight together, and achieve victory together.

Revolutionary cadres from various places recalled their experiences of fighting side by side with the great Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Cultural Revolution over the past year, and deeply felt that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great revolutionary army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Revolutionary cadres and broad masses in the capital said excitedly that the great Chinese People's Liberation Army is a unique revolutionary army personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. It is our revolutionary cadres' example and backbone. We are determined to better learn from the People's Liberation Army, to advance under the support of the People's Liberation Army, to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and to make the proletarian cultural revolution even better! Workers from the Beijing Gear Factory, who have formed a close friendship with the military support team, said, "The army fights with us, works with us, and our factory's revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. Production is gradually increasing, and the revolutionary cadre team is continually consolidating and growing stronger. The army loves the people, and the people support the army; the army and the people are inseparable. With the help of the army, we have achieved great success in military and political training. Today, some revolutionary teachers and students at Shijingshan Middle School braved the rain to paste big-character posters on the walls and hold discussions. They said: "At a critical moment when we encountered difficulties, Chairman Mao sent the army to help us with military and political training, to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, to achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary 'three-in-one' combination, and to resume classes and make revolution. We are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to raise high the great banner of supporting the army, to more humbly learn from the army, and to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shanghai said, "In the years of revolutionary war, the People's Liberation Army, under the great commander Chairman Mao, fought bravely and won the country. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the People's Liberation Army gave us the most resolute support, and the unity between the army and the people was like one person, achieving the great victory of the 'January Revolution' that shook the world. It can be said that without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no red mountains and rivers, no victory in the cultural revolution, and none of our achievements."

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the Xining area of Qinghai Province, such as the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary cadres, studied the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine and were elated. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth Automobile Factory in Qinghai Province and "August 18" warriors enthusiastically said, "The practice of the proletarian cultural revolution in Qinghai Province has made us deeply feel that the army is the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. At the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the Qinghai garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army firmly stood on the side of the "August 18" and other proletarian revolutionary cadres, armed the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helped the proletarian revolutionary cadres firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, won over, educated, and united the deceived masses and cadres who made mistakes, developed and strengthened the leftist forces, smashed the counter-revolutionary restoration tide, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary 'three-in-one' combination. They expressed their determination to raise high the banner of supporting the army, to forever stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the army, and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary cadres in Wuhan, such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands Alliance," who are in the midst of a new high tide of supporting the army activities, expressed that in the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Wuhan have closely united with and fought alongside the proletarian revolutionary cadres, establishing a flesh-and-blood combat friendship between the army and the people. After the evil plot of Khrushchev in China and his agents in the Wuhan area to sow discord between the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the People's Liberation Army was thoroughly foiled, the prestige of the People's Liberation Army was even higher, and we were even more united with the People's Liberation Army.

Revolutionary cadres of the Great Alliance Preparatory Committee of the Jiangxi Province proletarian revolutionary cadres said: "At the most difficult moment of the struggle, the 601st and 6810th units of the army gave us the most powerful support and the strongest protection, helping us achieve one victory after another. We guarantee to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee that we will definitely carry forward the glorious tradition of the people of the Jian'gan Mountain revolutionary base area, holding high the banner of supporting the army. We must support the army in completing the glorious task of 'three supports, two militaries' just as we supported the Red Army in the past."

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary youngsters of the "February 7th Commune" and "Kaifeng August 24th" proletarian revolutionary cadres enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorial in the *Red Flag* magazine. Nearly a thousand revolutionary youngsters from the "Zhengda United Committee" affiliated with the "February 7th Commune" took to the streets on the morning of August 20 to propagate to the broad revolutionary masses. They said, "Whoever dares to oppose the army, whoever dares to damage the army's lofty prestige, we will resolutely oppose them."

Revolutionary cadres of the General Headquarters of the Ningxia proletarian revolutionary cadres said, "At the most severe time when we proletarian revolutionary cadres were suppressed and persecuted, the broad officers and soldiers of the 8047th, 8048th, 8050th, and 8119th units timely and powerfully supported us, resolutely and decisively protected us. They breathed with us, shared our fate, fought side by side with us, and ensured that the proletarian cultural revolution in the Ningxia region proceeded victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Many warriors of the "Red Three Commands" in Gansu recalled their year-long struggle experience and said: "In the days of white terror, when we marched through wind and snow on foot, the army gave us their beds to sleep in, brought us water and food to eat; when we were attacked by the masses deceived by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the army stood up, resolutely stood with us, and fought together; the army helped us grasp Mao Zedong Thought, helped us overcome obstacles on the road ahead, making our direction clear, our fighting spirit firm, and our fighting strength stronger. The great victories we have achieved today are inseparable from the army's resolute support."

Revolutionary mass organizations such as "Changsha Workers' Alliance," "Xiangjiang Thunder," "Red Second Command" in Xinjiang, "Three Commands" in Hohhot, as well as broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Lhasa, and other places also held discussion meetings and study sessions today to seriously study the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine. With deep class feelings for the People's Liberation Army, they expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," to firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, to seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, and in the great battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois command department, to unite with, fight with, and achieve victory with the People's Liberation Army.

    各地无产阶级革命派回顾一年多来和伟大的中国人民解放军在文化大革命中并肩战斗的经历，更加深刻地体会到：中国人民解放军是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大革命军队。
    首都无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众激动地说，伟大的中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造、林彪同志直接指挥的举世无双的革命军队，是我们革命派的榜样和靠山。我们决心更好地向人民解放军学习，在人民解放军的支持下，乘胜前进，深入开展革命的大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好！同驻厂支左部队结下了亲密友谊的北京齿轮厂红色造反者广大战士说，解放军和我们共同战斗，共同劳动，我们工厂革命和生产形势越来越好，生产逐步上升，革命派队伍不断地巩固和壮大，军爱民，民拥军，军民骨肉就是不可分。在解放军帮助下军政训练取得很大成绩的石景山中学，一些革命师生今天冒雨在墙上贴大标语，举行座谈。他们说：在我们碰到困难的关键时刻，毛主席派来了解放军，帮助我们搞军政训练，活学活用毛主席著作，批判资产阶级反动路线，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，复课闹革命。我们决心响应毛主席的伟大号召，高高地举起拥军的伟大旗帜，更虚心地向解放军学习，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。

    青海省西宁地区“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众学习了《红旗》杂志社论，欢欣鼓舞。青海省第六汽车厂革命委员会成员和“八·一八”战士热情地说，青海省无产阶级文化大革命的实践使我们深深体会到：解放军是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，人民解放军青海驻军坚定不移地站在“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派一边，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，帮助无产阶级革命派紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，争取、教育、团结受蒙蔽的群众和犯有错误的干部，发展和壮大了左派队伍，粉碎了反革命复辟逆流，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。他们表示，一定要高举拥军的旗帜，永远和解放军肩并肩，心连心，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。

    江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会的广大战士说：在斗争最困难的时刻，解放军六○一一部队、六八一○部队给了我们最有力的支持，最坚强的保卫，帮助我们取得了一个又一个胜利。我们向毛主席、党中央保证：一定发扬井冈山革命老根据地人民的光荣传统，把拥军的旗帜举得更高更高。我们要象当年支持红军一样，支持解放军完成“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务。
    河南“二七公社”和开封“八·二四”无产阶级革命派战士和革命小将热情欢呼《红旗》杂志社论的发表。“二七公社”所属“郑大联委”的近千名革命小将，二十日上午纷纷走向街头，向广大革命群众进行宣传。他们说，谁胆敢反对解放军，谁胆敢破坏解放军的崇高威望，我们就坚决反对谁。
    宁夏无产阶级革命派总指挥部的广大战士说，在我们无产阶级革命派受压制、受迫害最严重的时候，八○四七部队、八○四八部队、八○五○部队和八一一九部队广大指战员，及时地有力地支持了我们，坚决果断地保卫了我们。他们与我们同呼吸，共命运，并肩战斗，保证了宁夏地区无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利进行。
    甘肃“红三司”的许多战士，回顾一年多的斗争经历说：在白色恐怖的日子里，我们冒着风雪严寒徒步长征时，解放军把自己的床铺让给我们睡，送水、送饭给我们吃；在我们受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的不明真相的群众围攻的时候，解放军挺身而出，坚决和我们站在一起，共同战斗；解放军帮助我们掌握毛泽东思想，帮助我们克服前进道路上的障碍，使我们方向明、斗志坚、越战越强。今天我们所取得的巨大胜利，是和解放军坚决支持分不开的。
    湖南“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”，新疆“红二司”，呼和浩特“三司”等革命群众组织，以及山东、山西、贵州、黑龙江、四川、陕西、浙江、拉萨等地的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，今天也都纷纷举行座谈会、学习会，认真学习《红旗》杂志社论。他们怀着对人民解放军深厚的阶级感情表示：决心响应毛主席的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决相信和依靠人民解放军，认真学习人民解放军，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗中，与人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
