They are determined to unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, fight together with them, and win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Garrison Command enthusiastically acclaimed the inscription by Vice Chairman Lin.

Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Thank you for Vice Chairman Lin's warm concern!"

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Military Region regard spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat as the greatest "love for the people." They study Chairman Mao's works together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.
