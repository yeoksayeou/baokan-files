Indian revolutionary people are hailing the armed struggle of peasants in Naxalbari, led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, as "very good." The violent revolution in Darjeeling is the harbinger of armed seizure of power. The revisionist leaders of the CPI are maligning the peasant struggle, betraying the revolutionary faction of the CPI, and are of the same ilk as the Danji traitor clique.

	NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) — The armed struggle of peasants in Darjeeling district, led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, has fired the first shot of the Indian armed revolution, shaking the Indian land. Revolutionary people are cheering "very good," while some revisionists, donning the cloak of "communists," are shouting "very bad" and fiercely opposing it, following in the footsteps of the Indian reactionaries.

	The revolutionary faction of the CPI, advocating armed seizure of power, is standing at the forefront of this peasant land revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary faction of the CPI in Darjeeling district ignited the first torch of armed struggle in the Naxalbari region. They have clearly declared that their armed struggle is "acting in accordance with the ideological line prescribed by Mao Zedong," and "Naxalbari has lit a fire that illuminates a new path, and this fire will continue." They pointed out that this struggle, in a broader sense, "is a struggle for seizing power." According to Indian newspapers, over the past four months, they have intensified the movement to turn Naxalbari into a revolutionary base and regard "establishing a revolutionary base as the first step to forming a communist government." They are mobilizing peasants to prepare from all aspects for a long-term armed struggle.

	Broad masses of the revolutionary faction of the CPI and Indian revolutionary people are enthusiastically praising and strongly supporting the struggle of Naxalbari peasants.

	According to a recent revelation by the Hindustan Standard, the revolutionary faction of the CPI has established the "Committee to Aid the Naxalbari Peasant Struggle" and set up many small groups in various places in northern West Bengal to mobilize people to support the revolution. They have also published various periodicals and books to propagate their views, support the armed struggle of Naxalbari peasants, and expose the sabotage of this struggle by a small clique of revisionists within the party.

	Revolutionary people and revolutionary youth in Calcutta have posted slogans in the city: "Red salute to Naxalbari!" and declared that revolutionary peasants "have the right to rebel."

	On the square of Calcutta University, recently, a group of young people shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "We welcome the Chinese path!" "Red salute to China!"

	On June 27, revolutionary people in West Bengal held a massive demonstration in front of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with revisionism!" "Red salute to Naxalbari!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"

	However, some revisionist leaders of the CPI in West Bengal insist on the revisionist line of "peaceful transition" and oppose the revolutionary line of armed struggle.

	They viciously attacked the armed struggle in Naxalbari as "very bad." When the so-called "non-Congress" government of West Bengal shouted to crush this armed struggle, the revisionist leaders of the CPI, who had become the deputy chief minister and ministers of this state government, actually said that the situation there was "chaotic," that the armed struggle of peasants was "wrong" and "excessive."

	While hypocritically expressing "condemnation" of the police killing of rebellious peasants in early May, they expressed "regret" over the death of a police officer during the suppression of peasants. They closely collaborated with the Indian reactionaries' deception, vigorously advocating "political solution" and resolving the problem of this region through "discussion among all progressive forces." They also promoted the official deception of fake land distribution, attempting to lure revolutionary party members and masses in Darjeeling district to abandon armed struggle. In early July, after all these deceptive measures were exposed and failed by the revolutionary faction of the CPI and rebellious peasants, they openly agreed to the state government's authorization of police to arrest and kill rebellious peasants.

	They also used party power to suppress the revolutionary faction. They confused right and wrong, turning black into white, labeling the revolutionary faction of the CPI, which led the peasant armed struggle, as "ultra-leftists" and "adventurists," attacking them for adopting an "adventurist and anti-Marxist line," "disobeying party instructions, and engaging in anti-party activities," and so on.

	As soon as the armed struggle in Darjeeling district broke out, they established a special organization to conduct so-called "investigations" of party members leading the armed struggle, shouting to "eliminate all such people." Then, they expelled these party members in large numbers and published their names in newspapers, providing convenience for the police and secret service agencies to carry out suppression. In mid-June, they abolished the existing CPI Darjeeling District Committee and Siliguri Regional Committee and appointed a committee led by party members they selected to replace them.

	The behavior of a small clique of revisionist leaders within the CPI in striking, deceiving, and betraying the revolutionary faction of the CPI, sabotaging the revolution, and opposing the peasant movement has prompted the revolutionary faction of the CPI to launch a more resolute struggle against them, further exposing that they are of the same ilk as the traitor Danji clique. According to Indian newspapers, some revisionist leaders of the CPI "have been continuously losing influence among the grassroots party members" and are in a "difficult situation." More and more ordinary party members are participating in the struggle against revisionism, and thus the strength of the revolutionary faction is growing.

	The great leader Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is armed seizure of power, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

	Armed struggle is a touchstone. In India, after the establishment of the armed struggle region of Darjeeling district peasants, true revolutionaries and true Marxist-Leninists will inevitably firmly advocate armed struggle, lead and support armed struggle, and be tempered in armed struggle, thereby gaining the support of the broad revolutionary people. False revolutionaries and false Marxist-Leninists will inevitably oppose and sabotage armed struggle, exposing their true faces of betraying and opposing the revolution, and being spit upon by the broad revolutionary people and history.

    印度革命人民欢呼纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争“好得很”
    大吉岭暴力革命是武装夺取政权的先声
    印共修正主义领导人大肆诬蔑农民斗争，出卖印共革命派，同丹吉叛徒集团是一丘之貉
    新华社三十一日讯  本社记者报道：印度共产党革命派领导的大吉岭县农民武装斗争，打响了印度武装革命的第一炮，它震撼了印度的大地。革命人民欢呼“好得很”，而一些披着“共产党人”外衣的修正主义分子，则跟在印度反动派后面，大叫“糟得很”，站在它的对面拚命反对。
    主张武装夺取政权的印度共产党革命派，在毛泽东思想指引下，站在这场农民土地革命的最前面。大吉岭县印共革命派领导纳萨尔巴里地区农民燃起了第一支武装斗争的火炬。他们明白宣告：他们的武装斗争“是按着毛泽东所规定的思想路线行事的”，“纳萨尔巴里点燃了照亮一条新的道路之火，这个火将继续下去。”他们指出，这场斗争从更广泛的意义来说，“是一场夺取政权的斗争”。据印度报纸报道，四个多月来，他们加紧了争取把纳萨尔巴里建成为一个革命根据地的运动，并且把“建立革命根据地作为成立一个共产党政府的第一步”。他们正在动员农民从各方面为进行长期武装斗争作准备。
    广大印共革命派和印度革命人民热情赞扬和热烈支持纳萨尔巴里农民的斗争。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》不久前透露，印共革命派已成立了“援助纳萨尔巴里农民斗争委员会”，并在西孟加拉邦北部各地成立了许多小组，动员人民支持革命。他们还出版了多种刊物、书籍宣传自己的主张，支持纳萨尔巴里的农民武装斗争，揭露党内一小撮修正主义分子破坏这场斗争的行径。
    加尔各答的革命人民和革命青年，在市内贴出了标语：“向纳萨尔巴里致以红色的敬礼！”并宣布革命农民“造反有理”。
    在加尔各答大学广场上，最近有一批青年高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“我们欢迎中国的道路！”“向中国致以红色敬礼！”等口号。
    在六月二十七日，西孟加拉邦革命人民在西孟加拉邦议会前举行了规模巨大的示威。示威者高呼：“打倒修正主义！”“向纳萨尔巴里致以红色的敬礼！”“毛泽东万岁！”等口号。
    但是，西孟加拉邦的印共某些修正主义领导人，坚持推行“和平过渡”的修正主义路线，反对武装斗争的革命路线。
    他们大肆攻击纳萨尔巴里的武装斗争“糟得很”。在所谓“非国大党”的西孟加拉邦政府叫嚷要粉碎这场武装斗争时，当上了这个邦政府的副首席部长和部长的印共修正主义领导人，竟然胡说什么那里的形势是“使人感到混乱的”，那里的农民武装斗争是“错误”的，“过火”的。
    他们在对五月下旬邦政府派警察枪杀起义农民一事假惺惺地表示“谴责”的同时，对一名警官在镇压农民时被起义农民打死“表示遗憾”。他们紧密配合印度反动派欺骗的一手，大肆鼓吹要“政治解决”，通过“一切进步力量间的讨论”来“解决”这个地区的问题。他们还推行由官方假分田等阴谋，诱骗大吉岭县要革命的党员和群众放弃武装斗争。七月初，在这一切欺骗措施都被印共革命派和起义农民识破而破产后，他们公然同意邦政府授权警察逮捕和枪杀起义农民。
    他们还利用党权，镇压革命派。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，把领导农民武装斗争的印共革命派打成“极左分子”、“冒险主义分子”，攻击他们采取了“冒险主义的和反马克思主义的路线”，“违抗党的指示，进行了反党活动”，等等。
    大吉岭县武装斗争一开展，他们就成立专门组织对领导武装斗争的党员进行所谓“调查”，叫嚷“决心清除所有这样的人”。接着，他们就大批开除这些党员，并在报纸上公布他们的名字，为警察特务机关进行镇压提供便利。六月中旬，他们废除了现有的印共大吉岭县委会和西里古里大区委员会，并且任命了由他们挑选的党员领导的组织委员会来代替。
    印共党内一小撮修正主义领导人打击、欺骗和出卖印共革命派、破坏革命、反对农民运动的行为，促使印共革命派向他们展开了更加坚决的斗争，也在广大党员中进一步暴露了他们同叛徒丹吉集团原来是一模一样的货色。据印度报纸报道，一些印共修正主义领导人“在基层党员中的影响已不断地丧失了”，“处境困难”。越来越多的普通党员正在参加反对修正主义的斗争，因而革命派“力量越来越强”。
    伟大的领袖毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    武装斗争问题是一块试金石。在印度，大吉岭县农民武装斗争地区建立后，真革命、真马克思列宁主义者必然坚决主张武装斗争，领导和支持武装斗争，并且在武装斗争中经受锻炼，从而得到广大革命人民的拥护。假革命、假马克思列宁主义者必然反对和破坏武装斗争，暴露出他们叛卖革命反对革命的真面目，而为广大革命人民和历史所唾弃。
