China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 12 sent a note to the Burmese Embassy in China, sternly pointing out that the Burmese Embassy's note of July 11 to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is "completely a pack of lies from a murderer." The note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists a large number of facts that fully prove that the Ne Win reactionary government is the mastermind behind this series of anti-China and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirmed: "The Chinese government's statement of June 29 proposed five serious demands, which the Burmese government must fulfill one by one. You cannot bluff and dodge your way out of this. If you continue to act recklessly, you will have to bear all the serious consequences that follow."

The note said: "The Chinese government has repeatedly protested strongly and made serious demands regarding the series of bloody anti-China and anti-Chinese actions perpetrated by the Burmese government, but the Burmese government has consistently adopted a delaying and evasive attitude. Now, under the condemnation of the peoples of China and Burma and the just public opinion of the world, you have racked your brains and schemed to concoct a very unconvincing so-called reply to China's several notes. After issuing this note, you have been self-satisfied and boastful, thinking that this would cover up your crimes and escape responsibility. In fact, your calculations are wrong. Your plotting of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities is evident, and the ironclad evidence is overwhelming. You cannot escape responsibility."

The note said: "The incoming note attempts to shift all blame, claiming that the Burmese government categorically denies being the instigator of this anti-China and anti-Chinese incident; it also solemnly states that 'the Burmese government is exercising its legitimate duties, conducting a comprehensive investigation, and taking appropriate actions according to the laws of the Union of Burma.' However, facts speak louder than words. The large amount of material obtained by the Chinese government from various sources fully proves that the Burmese government is the mastermind behind this anti-China and anti-Chinese incident. Here are just a few examples to illustrate the point.

	"(1) In mid-June of this year, the highest authorities of the Burmese government held a special meeting to designate China as the 'main enemy' and secretly plotted anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The meeting decided to use the ban on overseas Chinese students wearing Chairman Mao's badges as a pretext to incite nationalist sentiments and launch a large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign.

	"(2) According to reliable information, this anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign was jointly planned by the Burmese government and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The Burmese military intelligence agency, in organizing the mobs, widely recruited spies from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries in Burma, as well as remnants of the Kuomintang.

	"(3) Several weeks before the Burmese government implemented this conspiracy, its military intelligence agency sent a large number of spies to scout the areas around the overseas Chinese communities and formulated plans for the attacks. To attack the overseas Chinese, the Burmese police also underwent special training. The anti-China leaflets distributed by the mobs were drafted by the relevant departments of the Burmese 'Socialist Program Party.'

	"(4) On the eve of the bloody incident, the Burmese government spread rumors and incited people, claiming that 'a certain headmaster of a Chinese school has been murdered,' 'the Burmese Embassy in China has been burned down,' 'the Burmese Ambassador to China has been killed,' and so on, to stir up anti-China and anti-Chinese nationalist sentiments.

	"(5) Every time the mobs attacked the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese representative offices, Burmese military and police were already at the scene waiting more than an hour in advance. On several occasions, Burmese military and police even used loudspeakers to directly command the mobs to attack and retreat. When the mobs climbed over the walls into the Chinese Embassy to commit arson, they cheered and provided cover. After the mobs entered the Chinese Embassy compound to set fires and commit arson, these military and police then pretended to be victims, firing into the air to cover up their collusion with the mobs. The mobs and the military police were actually not much different; many military police, although they had taken off their uniforms, almost everyone was wearing a uniform-style undershirt issued by the Burmese military. A criminal named Jin Mai, who was captured on the spot by the Chinese Embassy personnel, admitted that his occupation was a 'soldier of the National Defense Army' working at the Yangon Bangladesh Cave Military Hospital. He also stated: 'It was not my own decision to come; I was sent by the military.'"

The note said: "Even listing the above few facts is enough to prove that the direct instigators and masterminds of this anti-China and anti-Chinese incident are the Burmese government. Those who should be investigated are not others but the Ne Win clique, and those who should be tried and punished are they."

The note pointed out: "The Burmese government incited the mobs to brazenly violate the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy in broad daylight, killing Chinese expert Liu Yi and injuring six Chinese Embassy staff members and diplomatic courier Cao Dalin. However, the incoming note shamelessly claims that the Burmese government had provided 'protection' for Liu Yi, which is utterly absurd and ridiculous. You only expressed 'regret' for Liu Yi's death and thought that would be the end of it, which is absolutely unacceptable! This blood debt must be repaid."

The note said: "In this fascist atrocity, many innocent overseas Chinese were also killed by the Burmese government, and countless others were looted, beaten, and arrested. The incoming note does not mention this bloody fact but claims that 'according to international customs, equal protection is provided for citizens of one's own country and citizens of other countries,' which is utterly absurd! What is particularly intolerable is that high-ranking officials of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, disregarding even the most basic international relations norms, openly stated that the persecution of overseas Chinese is 'Burma's internal affairs, and China cannot intervene.' Do you think you can carry out mass killings, mass arrests, mass burning, and mass looting of overseas Chinese, and the Chinese government has no right to protect overseas Chinese? This is the logic of pure fascist bandits."

The note said: "Since June 28, you have imposed a more than one-month-long armed blockade and siege on the Chinese Embassy, severely restricting the normal diplomatic activities of the Embassy. Even for daily purchases of vegetables and groceries, prior notification to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is required, including the vehicle number, names and positions of the personnel going out, the route, the items and quantities to be purchased, the time required, etc. Even if the Embassy notifies the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry often refuses to arrange it for various reasons, and even if it reluctantly makes arrangements, it delays for four to five hours. The right of Embassy personnel to visit their compatriots has been completely and unreasonably deprived. During this period, the Chinese Embassy has been strictly sealed off by layers of barbed wire, roadblocks, and armed troops, completely isolated from the outside world, and turned into an unprecedented 'embassy concentration camp' in the history of international relations. Yet, in the incoming note, you describe this practice as the 'greatest protection' for the Chinese Embassy. This shows that you do not even care about the most basic international relations norms."

The note said: "Our great leader Chairman Mao said, 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic. This is a law of Marxism.' History will prove that the Burmese reactionary government will not escape the punishment of this law."

The note said: "You attempt to use 'regret' to replace a public apology; use so-called 'comprehensive investigation' and 'legal actions' to replace the punishment of the criminals and their instigators; use so-called 'pacification' to replace compensation for the victims, and use deceptive 'protection' to cover up all your anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and the blockade of the Chinese Embassy. These are all nonsense and wishful thinking."

    我外交部列举事实驳斥缅驻华使馆的无耻狡辩
    奈温反动政府是反华排华的罪魁祸首
    重申中国政府提出的五项严正要求，缅甸反动政府必须照办
    新华社十二日讯　中国外交部十二日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，严正指出缅甸驻华大使馆七月十一日给中国外交部的照会“完全是杀人犯的一篇诳言”。中国外交部的照会列举的大量事实完全证明了奈温反动政府是策划这次反华排华法西斯暴行的罪魁祸首。
    中国外交部重申：“中国政府六月二十九日的声明中提出的五项严正要求，缅甸政府必须一一照办。你们休想胡扯耍赖，蒙混过关。如果你们继续一意孤行，就必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。”
    照会说：“中国政府就缅甸政府制造的一系列反华、排华的血腥暴行，多次提出了强烈抗议和严正要求，缅甸政府一直采取拖而不复的耍赖态度。现在，你们迫于中缅两国人民和全世界公正舆论的谴责，绞尽脑汁，挖空心思，拼凑了一个很不象样的所谓对中国几个照会的复照。这个照会发出之后，你们自鸣得意，大吹大擂，以为这样就可以掩人耳目，逃避罪责了。其实，你们的如意算盘打错了，你们策划反华、排华，罪恶昭彰，铁证如山，想赖是赖不掉的。”
    照会说：“来照企图把你们的罪行推得一干二净，说什么缅甸政府断然否认是这次反华排华事件的策划者；还煞有介事地说什么‘缅甸政府正在行使其正当职责，进行全面调查，并根据缅甸联邦的法律采取适当的行动’。但是，事实胜于雄辩，中国政府从各方面得到的大量材料，完全证明缅甸政府就是策划这次反华排华事件的罪魁祸首。这里只举几个例子，就足够说明问题。
    “（一）就在今年六月中旬，缅甸政府最高当局，曾专门召开会议，确定中国为‘主要敌人’，秘密策划反华排华的勾当。会上决定以禁止华侨学生佩戴中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章为由，挑动民族情绪，大肆反华排华。
    “（二）根据可靠材料，证实这次反华排华是由缅甸政府和美国中央情报局一起策划的。缅甸政府军事情报机关在组织暴徒时，广泛吸收了美国中央情报局、苏联修正主义和印度反动派在缅甸的特务和蒋帮分子参加。
    “（三）早在缅甸政府实施这一阴谋计划的几个星期以前，它的军事情报机关就派出大批特务，到华侨团体住地周围观察地形，制定了袭击计划。为了袭击华侨，缅甸警察还进行专门训练。暴徒所散发的反华传单，就是由缅甸‘社会主义纲领党’的有关部门拟定的。
    “（四）缅甸政府在制造这次血腥事件的前夕，就大造谣言，蛊惑人心，说什么‘某某华侨学校校长被害’，‘缅甸驻华大使馆被烧毁’，‘缅甸驻华大使被杀’等等，煽动反华排华的民族情绪。
    “（五）每次暴徒袭击中国大使馆和其他中国代表机构时，缅甸军队、警察都是提前一个多小时就来到现场等候。有好几次，缅甸军警竟然用扩音器直接指挥暴徒进攻和撤退。在暴徒爬墙进入中国大使馆行凶时，他们在一旁助威和掩护。而当暴徒进入中国大使馆院内纵火行凶以后，这些军警却贼喊捉贼，对空鸣枪，企图掩盖他们与暴徒狼狈为奸的罪恶行径。
    “暴徒和军警，其实并没有很大区别，很多军警虽然脱了军装，但几乎每个人都穿着缅甸军队统一式样的背心。被中国大使馆人员当场捕获的凶手金貌，便供认他的职业是‘国防军战士’，在仰光孟加拉洞军医院工作。他还供称：‘不是我自己要来的，是军队派我来的。’”
    照会说：“仅仅列举以上几个事实，就足够证明，这次反华、排华事件的直接策划者和元凶，就是缅甸政府。应当受到调查的不是别人，就是奈温集团，应当受到审判和惩罚的，也是他们这一伙。”
    照会指出：“缅甸政府唆使暴徒，在光天化日之下，恣意侵犯中国大使馆的外交特权，杀害中国援缅专家刘逸，打伤六名中国大使馆人员和外交信使曹达林，而来照却厚颜无耻地说，缅甸政府曾经为刘逸提供了‘保护’，真是语无伦次，荒唐到了极点。你们对刘逸之死，也只表示了一声‘遗憾’，想就此了事，这是绝对办不到的！这笔血债一定要偿还。”
    照会说：“在这次法西斯暴行中，惨遭缅甸政府杀害的，还有大批无辜华侨，遭受洗劫、毒打和逮捕的，更是不计其数。来照闭口不谈这一血淋淋的事实，却说什么‘根据国际惯例，对本国公民和非本国公民给予同样的保护’，真是荒谬绝伦！特别令人不能容忍的是，缅甸外交部的高级官员不顾最起码的国际关系准则，公然把残害华侨说成是‘缅甸内政，中国不能介入。’难道你们对华侨可以进行大屠杀、大逮捕、大焚烧、大抢劫，而中国政府就没有保护华侨的权利吗？这是十足的法西斯强盗逻辑。”
    照会说，“你们从六月二十八日起，就对中国大使馆实行了一个多月的武装包围和封锁，大使馆正常的外交活动不但受到百般限制，就连日常出去买蔬菜和副食品，都要事先向缅甸外交部申报车号、外出人员的姓名和职务、行车路线、采购的东西和数量、要用多少时间，等等。即使大使馆通知了外交部，外交部也往往以种种借口不予安排，就是勉强作出安排，也要拖延四、五小时之久。大使馆人员看望本国侨民的权利，则完全遭受无理剥夺。在这个期间，中国大使馆实际上已为层层铁丝网、路障和武装军队所严密封锁，完全与外界隔绝，变成国际关系史上从所未有的‘使馆集中营’。你们在来照中，却把这种做法说成是对中国大使馆的‘最大保护’。这说明你们连起码的国际关系准则也不要了。”
    照会说：“我们的伟大领袖毛主席说，‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。’历史即将证明，缅甸反动政府也逃脱不了这条定律的制裁。”
    照会说：“你们妄图以‘遗憾’顶替公开道歉；以所谓‘全面调查’和‘依法采取适当的行动’顶替惩办凶手及其主使者；以所谓‘安抚’顶替对受害者的赔偿，以骗人的‘保护’来掩盖你们一切反华排华和封锁中国大使馆的罪行，这些都是胡说八道，痴心妄想。”
