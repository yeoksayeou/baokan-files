Our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Our newspapers should be run by everyone, by all the people, by the whole Party, and not just by a few people behind closed doors." We poor and lower-middle peasants understand that this means newspapers should be run by us workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only when we actively participate in running newspapers can they truly become a powerful weapon in our hands and truly serve us workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Our sworn enemies—the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party—openly oppose Chairman Mao's teachings. They blatantly oppose relying on us workers, peasants, and soldiers to run newspapers and insist on letting so-called "experts" control them. Let me tell you, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are the smartest and bravest. We are the main force in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The proletarian newspapers must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the three great revolutionary movements. How can this be done without relying on us workers, peasants, and soldiers?

Before liberation, newspapers were in the hands of the landlord and bourgeoisie, run entirely by them to serve their reactionary rule. At that time, we poor and lower-middle peasants rarely even saw what a newspaper looked like, let alone participate in running one. After liberation, we workers, peasants, and soldiers stood up, and newspapers and broadcasts should have been run by us. However, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party advocated for "experts" to run newspapers, insisting that counterrevolutionary revisionists and reactionary literary figures of the landlord and bourgeoisie control our newspapers. Those bad elements kept us poor and lower-middle peasants at a distance, not allowing us to participate in running newspapers. They picked apart and insulted everything we workers, peasants, and soldiers wrote, criticizing us for being "too rigid," "lacking theory," and "lacking human touch." They spouted nothing but nonsense. Today, we poor and lower-middle peasants want to tell you: Against you counterrevolutionary revisionists, we must be "rigid," not "soft." We hate you scoundrels to the core. How can we be polite to you? "Lacking theory"? Right, we poor and lower-middle peasants indeed do not have your counterrevolutionary revisionist "theory." But we have Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory, and we will use it to smash your counterrevolutionary revisionist "theory" to pieces! As for "human touch," there's no need to mention it. Seeing you, we only feel hatred and anger. We must thoroughly defeat you. This is what Chairman Mao means by one class oppressing another!

In the past, you scoundrels controlled some of our newspapers and broadcasts, viciously cursing our great Party, cursing proletarian dictatorship, and cursing our great leader Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants were so angry our lungs nearly burst. When we tried to criticize you, you suppressed and attacked us, deleting and cutting our articles, and holding them back from publication. Now, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing the counterrevolutionary revisionists in the news industry—the Chinese Khrushchev—and overthrowing them. The revolutionary masses have firmly seized control of newspapers and broadcasts, these weapons of dictatorship. We poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed. We must, together with our worker comrades, PLA comrades, and revolutionary intellectuals, firmly occupy the news front. We will run our news industry as a powerful weapon to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and as a powerful weapon to exercise dictatorship over the landlord and bourgeoisie and all reactionaries.

    我们工农兵必须占领新闻阵地
    北京通县翟里大队  邓德民
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”我们贫下中农懂得，这就是说报纸要靠我们工农兵来办。只有我们积极参加办报，报纸才能真正成为我们手中强有力的武器，才能真正为我们工农兵服务。
    我们贫下中农的死对头——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派却公开同毛主席唱反调。他明目张胆地反对依靠我们工农兵办报，只要那些“专家”把持报纸。老实告诉你党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，最聪明，最勇敢，是阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的主力军。无产阶级的报纸要为工农兵服务，要为工农兵进行三大革命运动服务，不依靠我们工农兵行吗？
    解放前，报纸都在地主资产阶级手里，全由地主资产阶级办，为地主资产阶级的反动统治服务。那时候，我们贫下中农连报纸是什么样子都很少见到，当然更谈不上参加办报了。解放了，我们工农兵翻身作主了，报纸、广播本来应该靠我们工农兵来办了。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派偏偏鼓吹“专家”办报，硬要让那些反革命修正主义分子、地主资产阶级反动文人把持我们的报纸。那些坏家伙把我们贫下中农赶得远远的，不许我们参加办报。他们对我们工农兵写的稿子百般挑剔，胡批乱骂，什么“硬棒棒”啦，什么“没有理论”啦，什么没有“人情味”啦。真是鬼话连篇。今天，我们贫下中农要正告你们：对于你们这些反革命修正主义分子，就是要“硬棒棒”，决不能“软绵绵”。我们恨透了你们这帮家伙，难道还能跟你们讲客气吗？“没有理论”，对了，你们那套反革命修正主义的“理论”，我们贫下中农确实没有。但是，我们有的是毛主席的革命理论，我们就要用毛主席的理论把你们的反革命修正主义“理论”砸个稀巴烂！至于“人情味”，更不用提了。看到你们，我们只有仇恨和怒火。对于你们，只有彻底打倒。这就是毛主席所说的一个阶级压迫另一个阶级！
    过去，你们这伙坏蛋把持了我们的一些报纸、广播，恶毒地咒骂我们伟大的党，咒骂无产阶级专政，咒骂我们伟大领袖毛主席。我们贫下中农肺都气炸了。要批判你们，你们就压制我们，打击我们，对我们的文章大删大砍，扣下不发。现在，毛主席领导我们开展无产阶级文化大革命，把新闻界反革命修正主义分子的总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫揪了出来，打翻在地。无产阶级革命派把报纸、广播这些专政武器紧紧掌握在手中。我们贫下中农痛快极了。我们一定要同工人同志、解放军同志和革命的知识分子一道，牢牢地占领新闻阵地，把我们的新闻事业办成宣传毛泽东思想的最有力的武器，办成对地主资产阶级和一切反动派实行专政的最有力的武器。
