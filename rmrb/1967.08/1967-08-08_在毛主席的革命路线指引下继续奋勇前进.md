The magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, like the mighty Yangtze River, surges forward day by day. Today, we, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, are filled with boundless joy and excitement as we commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. Today, we have so much to say to Chairman Mao! All our words can be summed up in one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao are a great development of Marxism-Leninism and a beacon for the proletarian cultural revolution. Over the past year, the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong and the beacon of the "Sixteen Points," has broken through the numerous obstacles set by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, achieving one victory after another.

However, "the enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan are unwilling to meet their doom. Taking advantage of the visit of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Wuhan to handle the cultural revolution in Wuhan, they manipulated a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" and the "Public Security and Procuratorate" to direct the struggle against the proletarian headquarters, brutally suppressing the revolutionary masses. At this critical moment of class struggle, under the personal care of Chairman Mao and with the support of the people and the army nationwide, we, relying on the broad revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, once again smashed the enemy's desperate counterattack and exposed the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev within the party and the army in Wuhan, throwing them to the ground. The broad masses who were deceived have seen through the enemy's true face and have risen up to strike back. The enemy is now isolated and increasingly deserted.

How to deal with the deceived masses within the "Million Heroes" is a very important issue for us revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: We must firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good. We believe that the deceived masses within the "Million Heroes" are innocent. They are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line and are revolutionary. They are our class brothers. Only by winning over the deceived masses can we completely isolate the bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." Only by winning over the deceived masses can we continuously expand our class ranks and concentrate our firepower to strike the enemy. Only by winning over the deceived masses can we effectively implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Consolidating and strengthening the unity within the revolutionary masses is a key issue in concentrating our forces to launch a fierce attack on the main enemy of the people. We, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We will definitely unite and combine our forces under the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line to fight against the enemy. For the differences among revolutionary mass organizations, we will firmly follow the "Sixteen Points," correctly handle the contradictions among the people, understand and forgive each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, strengthen the unity among revolutionary organizations, and will not do anything that hurts our friends and pleases our enemies, nor will we give the class enemy any opportunity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." We will follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and firmly respond to the call of "supporting the army and loving the people." In the previous stage, the Wuhan troops made mistakes in their direction and line in their work of supporting the left. Now they are correcting their mistakes and are determined to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Recently, the broad officers and soldiers of the Wuhan troops have supported the revolutionary masses with practical actions. We, the revolutionary masses, express our warmest welcome and firmest support for the revolutionary actions of the Wuhan troops. At present, we must be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracy to sow discord between the army and the people. We are determined to launch a new high tide of the "supporting the army and loving the people" movement and do an even better job in this regard.

We, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, vow to be the iron fist of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Our heads can be cut off, and our blood can be shed, but Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line cannot be abandoned. We, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, will, as always, strive to study the "Sixteen Points," firmly implement the "Sixteen Points," and bravely defend the "Sixteen Points." We will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely advance against the storms of class struggle, deeply carry out the great criticism, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    在毛主席的革命路线指引下继续奋勇前进
    武汉地区无产阶级革命派总指挥部
    波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命，象万里长江，一日千里，滚滚向前。今天，我们武汉地区无产阶级革命派，以无比喜悦和激动的心情来纪念毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发表一周年。今天，我们有多少心里话要对毛主席讲啊！千言万语汇成一句话：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！万寿无疆！！！”
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，是对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯。一年来，武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大的毛泽东思想照耀下，在“十六条”这盏指路明灯指引下，冲破了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的重重阻力，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    但是，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人是不甘心自己的灭亡的，他们趁谢富治、王力同志到武汉处理武汉地区文化大革命问题时，操纵“百万雄师”和“公检法”中一小撮坏头头，把斗争矛头指向无产阶级司令部，疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派。就在这两个阶级、两条道路的决战时刻，我们在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在全国军民的支持下，依靠广大革命群众和驻武汉地区的解放军指战员，再一次粉碎了敌人的疯狂反扑，并揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫在武汉地区党内军内的代理人，把他们打翻在地。广大受蒙蔽的群众也识破了敌人的真面目，纷纷起来反戈一击。敌人已经众叛亲离，日趋孤立。
    如何对待“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众，对于我们无产阶级革命派来说，是一个十分重要的问题。毛主席教导我们：要坚决相信大多数群众是好的。我们认为“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众是无罪的，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，他们是要革命的，是我们的阶级弟兄。只有争取了受蒙蔽的群众，才能彻底孤立“百万雄师”中的坏头头。只有争取了受蒙蔽的群众，才能不断扩大自己的阶级队伍，集中火力打击敌人。只有争取了受蒙蔽的群众，才能很好地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    巩固和加强无产阶级革命派内部的团结，这是集中力量向人民的主要敌人猛烈开火的关键问题。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派决不辜负毛主席和党中央的希望，一定要在无产阶级革命路线的旗帜下团结起来，联合起来，共同对敌。对于革命群众组织之间的分歧，我们坚决按照“十六条”办事，正确处理人民内部的矛盾，互相谅解，求大同，存小异，克服各种非无产阶级思想，加强革命组织之间的团结，决不做亲者痛、仇者快的事情，决不给阶级敌人以可乘之机。
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”我们决心遵循毛主席的伟大教导，坚决响应“拥军爱民”的伟大号召。前一阶段，武汉部队在支左工作中犯了方向路线错误。现在他们在改正之中，决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。最近，武汉部队的广大指战员以实际行动支持无产阶级革命派。对于武汉部队的革命行动，我们无产阶级革命派表示最热烈的欢迎，最坚决的支持。当前，我们一定要警惕阶级敌人离间军民关系的阴谋活动。我们决心掀起“拥军爱民”活动的新高潮，把“拥军爱民”的工作搞得好上加好。
    我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派誓作中央文革的铁拳头。头可断，血可流，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不可丢。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派将一如既往，努力学习“十六条”，坚决执行“十六条”，勇敢捍卫“十六条”。我们永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪奋勇前进，深入地开展革命的大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
