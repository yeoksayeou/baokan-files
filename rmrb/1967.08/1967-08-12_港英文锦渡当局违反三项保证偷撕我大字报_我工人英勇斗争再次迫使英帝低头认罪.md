The British authorities in Kowloon's Man Kam To have violated three guarantees and secretly torn down our big-character posters. Our workers' brave struggle has once again forced the British imperialists to admit their guilt.

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, August 11th: From the afternoon of the 10th to the early morning of today, the porters of Man Kam To in Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, have once again bravely fought against the British authorities in Kowloon's Man Kam To for violating the three guarantees made on August 5th, achieving a great victory.

On August 5th, the British authorities in Kowloon's Man Kam To stated in a "guarantee letter" that they would safeguard our workers' big-character posters. However, on the night of the 9th, they secretly tore down our workers' big-character posters with slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with British Imperialism!" and set up barbed wire obstacles that night, blocking the trade passage at the Man Kam To Bridgehead.

At 1:30 PM on the 10th, our 28 porters pushed 18 two-wheeled handcarts across the border to deliver goods. Due to the blocked path, a cargo truck hit the barbed wire and overturned, injuring one worker, which infuriated our workers. At 2 PM, the workers, carrying protest big-character posters, went to the Man Kam To police station of the British authorities to demand an explanation, asking why they had violated the guarantees made on the 5th and torn down our big-character posters, and why they had set up obstacles to block traffic, causing personal injuries. The British officials from the Taipo "Public Office," including the British officer Bow Foo Tat, the battalion commander of the 48th Regiment, 1st Battalion, Major McAllister, and the police inspector of Man Kam To, Pitten, hid behind the barbed wire and ordered a large number of troops to enter the position and set up machine guns to threaten the crowd. Our porters loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the policy of self-reliance and hard struggle, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They showed no weakness and persisted in their struggle. After dark, these British officials tried to slip away but were closely watched by the workers and failed.

At 8 PM on the 10th, our workers pointed out that Man Kam To is an important passage for the import and export of goods, and a large part of the agricultural and livestock products entering Hong Kong pass through here. If the British authorities in Man Kam To dare to block traffic at will, the consequences will be borne by the British. At this time, the British officials were panicked and prepared to remove the barbed wire. However, to separate the crowd, they brought in engineers and air compressors and other machinery, intending to first build a barbed wire fence in the back before removing it. The British authorities' despicable actions made our people unable to tolerate it any longer. By 10 PM, the workers together pulled open the barbed wire and walked into the police station to reason with the British officials face to face. At this time, the British officials not only did not admit their guilt to our people, but the British officer McAllister even drew his gun to shoot at the crowd. The workers immediately took his gun and seized the nearby weapons of the British soldiers and police, including light machine guns, heavy machine guns, carbines, submachine guns, rifles, handguns, and hand grenades. The workers surrounded the British officials and conducted negotiations. After being surrounded by the crowd, more than a hundred mercenaries pointed their guns at the crowd. Our people seriously warned Bow Foo Tat that if the British troops did not withdraw immediately, we could not guarantee his safety. The cowardly Bow Foo Tat had no choice but to pick up the walkie-talkie and shout to the British troops: "Get out of here, I will handle the matter here."

Through our workers' resolute struggle, by 2 AM on the 11th, Bow Foo Tat, McAllister, Pitten, and others finally admitted their guilt in front of our righteous workers and wrote a "guilt admission letter." In the "guilt admission letter," Bow Foo Tat and others guaranteed the strict implementation of the three guarantees signed on August 5th, severely punished the culprits who tore down the slogans and big-character posters, and publicly admitted their mistakes, apologized, and compensated; immediately removed the barbed wire that affected traffic and hindered the import and export of goods, ensured traffic safety, and guaranteed that no obstacles affecting traffic would be set up in the future; and took full responsibility for the work injuries and losses caused by the obstruction of traffic, and fulfilled the compensation items within 24 hours.

Afterward, the porters, with Bow Foo Tat and others, went up to the bridgehead to check and return the weapons to the British authorities. At 4 AM, Bow Foo Tat and others wrote a "receipt," and our porters, singing "The Sailors on the Boundless Ocean Rely on the Helmsman," returned victoriously to our side.

    港英文锦渡当局违反三项保证偷撕我大字报
    我工人英勇斗争再次迫使英帝低头认罪
    新华社广州十一日电  十日下午到今天清晨，广东省宝安县文锦渡搬运工人，对港英文锦渡当局违反八月五日三项保证的行为，再一次进行了英勇斗争，取得了巨大的胜利。
    八月五日港英文锦渡当局曾经在“保证书”中说，保证代我工人保管大字报，可是竟在九日晚偷偷把我工人贴的“毛主席万岁！”“打倒英帝！”等标语和大字报撕掉。并在当天晚上用铁丝网设置障碍，阻塞了文锦渡桥头出入贸易口通道。
    十日下午一时半，我二十八名搬运工人推了十八辆双轮手推车过境送货，因通路阻塞，一辆货车触铁丝网翻倒，一名工人受伤，引起我工人极大愤慨。下午两点，工人们带着抗议大字报去港英文锦渡警署讲理，质问他们为什么违反五日保证，撕毁我大字报？为什么设置障碍物阻塞交通造成人身事故？港英大埔“理民府”官员鲍富达，四十八旅十团一营中校营长麦亚里士达，以及文锦渡警司披顿等，藏在铁丝网后面，命令大批部队进入阵地架设机枪威胁群众。我搬运工人高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毫不示弱，坚持斗争。天黑以后，这几个港英官员想溜走，但被工人紧紧监视着未能得逞。
    十日晚上八点钟，我工人提出文锦渡是重要出入货物孔道，运入香港很大部分农副产品和畜产品都从这里过境，如果港英文锦渡当局胆敢任意阻塞交通，后果由港英负完全责任。这时，港英官员慌了手脚，准备拆掉铁丝网。但他们为了隔开群众，调来工兵和空压机等机械，准备先在后边修一道铁丝网以后再拆。港英当局这些卑劣行径使我群众忍无可忍，到晚上十时，工人们一起上前，拉开铁丝网，走进警署，同港英官员当面进行说理斗争。这时，港英官员不但不向我群众低头认罪，英国军官麦亚里士达竟拔出手枪准备向群众射击，工人立刻向前缴了他的手枪，并缴获了附近准备开枪的英军和警察的轻机枪、重机枪、卡宾枪、冲锋枪、步枪、手枪、手榴弹等武器。工人们把港英官员们围在中间，进行谈判。港英官员被群众包围以后，一百多名雇佣军又举枪向群众包围过来，我群众严重警告鲍富达，如果英军不立即撤退，我们不能保证他的生命安全。怕死的鲍富达只好拿起步话机，向英军喊道：“你们滚开，这儿的事由我处理。”
    经过我工人的坚决斗争，到十一日凌晨两点，鲍富达、麦亚里士达、披顿等才在我义正词严的工人群众面前低头认罪，写了“认罪保证书”。鲍富达等在“认罪保证书”中保证严格履行八月五日签署的三项保证，对撕毁标语、大字报的罪魁祸首严加惩办，并公开承认错误，赔礼道歉；立即拆除影响交通，妨碍货物进出口的铁丝网，保证交通安全，保证今后不再设立任何影响交通的障碍物；对由于阻塞交通所造成的工伤事故和损失，由港英当局负全部责任，并在二十四小时内履行兑现赔偿项目。
    此后，搬运工人们带着鲍富达等人走上桥头，清点退给港英当局的武器。清晨四点鲍富达等人写了“收据”，我搬运工人高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，胜利返回我方。
