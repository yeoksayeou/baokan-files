Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to better study, grasp, and apply the "Sixteen Points," and through revolutionary criticism promote revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination" to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

New China News Agency, August 8th: Revolutionary committees of workers and peasants, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country continued to hold meetings and engage in various artistic and educational activities today, enthusiastically celebrating the first anniversary of the historic Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant revolutionary document "Bombard the Headquarters" and the great revolutionary program "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao.

The hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, while enthusiastically participating in the celebration activities, reviewed the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year. Their revolutionary spirit is more vibrant, and their fighting spirit is more soaring. They proudly declared that they must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the theory, line, policy, methods, and principles proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao for conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, organize a vast revolutionary army, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the capital Beijing, revolutionary committees of workers and peasants held various activities to enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee. The Red Guards of the capital's universities and colleges, while participating in the celebration activities, have launched a deeper and broader wave of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. They proudly said, "As Chairman Mao taught us, 'It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy than to imitate King Xiang Yu.' We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, strive to be the vanguard of revolutionary criticism, and create new merits in the battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev." The revolutionary committees of workers and peasants in Wuhan said, "In the Cultural Revolution, we have achieved great victories. However, we deeply understand that revolution is not an easy task. Although the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan have fallen into the water, they can still bite. We, the revolutionary committees of workers and peasants in Wuhan, must be a hundred times more vigilant, unite as one, and wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the bourgeois headquarters to pieces." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigou Brigade in Xigou Commune, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, where national agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan are located, launched a campaign to study Chairman Mao's works and summarize the experiences of the Cultural Revolution over the past year to commemorate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee. Li Shunda and Shen Jilan said, "We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of Xigou, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating the fallen dogs, politically, ideologically, and theoretically defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters."

Revolutionary fighters of the revolutionary committees of workers and peasants, Red Guards, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country, on the day celebrating the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Points" and other brilliant documents. They are determined to further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and great strategic deployment through study, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and carry out the revolutionary criticism better. The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill recently organized all the revolutionary workers in the factory to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, the "Sixteen Points," and the editorial of the 13th issue of the "Red Flag" magazine. The revolutionary workers excitedly said: One year ago today, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," pointing out the way for our Cultural Revolution. Over the past year, we have followed the course set by the great commander Chairman Mao, moving from victory to victory! Today, in the great battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, we must better study, familiarize ourselves with, grasp, and apply the "Sixteen Points," and carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle better and better. Revolutionary youths in Guiyang, Harbin, Jinan, and Hohhot expressed that the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by Chairman Mao are our guide to action. We understand that politically, ideologically, and theoretically defeating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters is a glorious and arduous battle. We must study Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, and the "Sixteen Points" more diligently, enhance our revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and create new merits in the battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

"Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries." Revolutionary committees of workers and peasants and Red Guards across the country, while enthusiastically celebrating the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, revisited Chairman Mao's great teaching and felt particularly close. They all expressed that they must further unite all forces that can be united, promote unity through criticism, form a vast revolutionary army, concentrate firepower, and unite against the enemy. They said: Carrying out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters is the central task before us. To complete this great historical task, we must, on the basis of common opposition to the enemy, strive to overcome all non-proletarian thoughts such as sectarianism, factionalism, cliquism, and opportunism, continue to consolidate and expand the broadest revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core, unite all forces that can be united, and carry out the criticism more vigorously and thoroughly. The fighters of the "August 7th Commune" in Henan expressed: Over the past year, under the brilliant guidance of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and the "Sixteen Points," the fighters of the "August 7th Commune" closely followed Chairman Mao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, overcame countless difficulties, and exposed the agents of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Henan. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite all forces that can be united, and launch a new wave of criticism throughout the province to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary committees of workers and peasants and Red Guards in Tianjin expressed that in the wave of mass revolutionary criticism, they must turn factories, villages, schools, and offices into battlefields of criticism, bury the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Tianjin in the vast ocean of people's war, and make them never rise again!

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, while hailing the brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, are deeply criticizing the capitalist reactionary line and capitalist military line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. In the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," many units, through continuous revolutionary criticism, deepened their hatred for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, loved the revolutionary pioneers who charged in the Cultural Revolution even more, and expressed their firm stand with the revolutionary committees of workers and peasants, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end together with the revolutionary committees. The revolutionary committees of workers and peasants of the Navy, Air Force, and General Logistics Department, who dared to take the lead and be the vanguard in executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the Cultural Revolution, all firmly expressed at today's memorial meeting that they must further carry out mass revolutionary criticism, pursue and attack the fallen dogs, and be the strong rear guard of the revolutionary committees of workers and peasants across the country, making new contributions to support and defend the thousands of revolutionary pioneers.

    在首都北京，无产阶级革命派和革命群众举行各种活动，热烈庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年。首都大中学校的红卫兵小将们，在开展庆祝活动的同时，已经掀起了更加深入、更加广泛的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及彭真反革命修正主义集团的大批判、大斗争的新高潮。他们豪迈地说，毛主席教导我们“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，争当革命大批判的急先锋，在彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的战斗中，创立新的功勋。武汉地区无产阶级革命派说，在文化大革命中，我们已经取得了伟大的胜利。但是，我们深深懂得，革命是件不容易的事。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人虽然已经落水，但他们还是会咬人的。我们武汉地区无产阶级革命派必须百倍提高警惕，团结一致，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，把资产阶级司令部砸个稀巴烂。全国农业劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰所在的山西平顺县西沟公社西沟大队的贫下中农，为了纪念党的八届十一中全会召开一周年，展开了大学毛主席著作、总结一年来文化大革命经验的活动。李顺达、申纪兰说，我们西沟贫下中农和革命群众，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，以痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒斗臭，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    各地无产阶级革命派战士、红卫兵小将和人民解放军指战员，在庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的日子里，又一次认真学习了毛主席的《炮打司令部》和十六条等光辉文献。他们决心通过学习进一步领会、理解毛主席的革命路线和伟大战略部署，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，把革命的大批判开展得更好。上海国棉十七厂革命委员会，近日来组织全厂革命职工认真学习毛主席著作、十六条以及《红旗》杂志十三期社论。革命职工们兴奋地说：一年前的今天，毛主席亲自主持制定了十六条，为我们指明了文化大革命的道路。一年来，我们沿着伟大统帅毛主席指引的航向，从胜利走向胜利！今天，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗中，我们一定要更好地学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，把革命的大批判、大斗争，搞得好上加好。贵阳、哈尔滨、济南、呼和浩特等地的革命小将表示，毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，是我们行动的指南。我们懂得，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，这是一场光荣而艰巨的硬仗。我们一定要更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席的《炮打司令部》大字报、十六条，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的战斗中立新功。
      “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”各地无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将们，在热烈庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的时候，在热烈欢呼一年来文化大革命的光辉胜利的时候，重温毛主席的这一伟大教导，感到特别亲切。他们纷纷表示，一定要进一步团结一切可以团结的力量，通过大批判促进大联合，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，集中火力，一致对敌。他们说：搞好革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，是摆在我们面前的中心任务。为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，我们必须在共同对敌的基础上，努力克服山头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、风头主义等一切非无产阶级思想，继续巩固和扩大以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，团结一切可以团结的人，把大批判搞得更加轰轰烈烈和深入细致。河南“二七公社”的战士表示：一年来在八届十一中全会和十六条的光辉照耀下，“二七公社”战士紧跟毛主席，紧跟中央文革，排除了千难万险，揪出了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在河南的代理人。这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。今天，我们在欢庆党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的时候，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结一切可以团结的力量，在全省范围内掀起大批判的新高潮，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。天津无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将表示，在群众性的革命大批判高潮中，一定要使工厂内外、村庄内外、学校内外、机关内外，都变成大批判的战场，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其在天津的代理人，埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海里，叫他们永世不得翻身！
    中国人民解放军广大指战员在欢呼一年来文化大革命的辉煌胜利的时候，正在深入批判中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级军事路线。在“三支”“两军”第一线上的许多部队，通过连续的革命大批判，加深了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨，更加热爱在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命闯将，表示坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，同革命派一起把文化大革命进行到底。坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、在无产阶级文化大革命中敢于打头阵、当先锋的海军、空军和总后勤部等领导机关的无产阶级革命派，在今天举行的纪念集会上，都坚决表示要进一步深入开展群众性的革命大批判，穷追猛打落水狗，誓作全国无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，为支持和保卫千百万革命闯将作出新贡献。
