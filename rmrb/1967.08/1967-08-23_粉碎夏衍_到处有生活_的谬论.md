The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan is in cahoots with Hu Feng, actively peddling the black goods of "life is everywhere," corrupting and poisoning the revolutionary literary and artistic troops. Xia Yan said: "Hu Feng's followers once proposed 'life is everywhere,' everywhere can be experienced, and there is no need to go to the fiery struggle. They proposed this mainly to oppose our call for writers to participate in practical tempering and fiery struggle. However, the phrase 'life is everywhere' itself is not necessarily entirely wrong, because indeed there are all kinds of people and all kinds of life everywhere." Xia Yan, in the name of opposing Hu Feng, actually advocates Hu Feng's reactionary fallacies. Xia Yan and Hu Feng sing the same tune, proving that they are birds of a feather.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists with a future, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, must go to the fiery struggle..." Under the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, only the likes of Xia Yan can freely engage in peaceful evolution, while there is no right for literary and artistic workers to go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The revolutionary teachers and students of our school have repeatedly requested, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to go to factories, villages, and troops, to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, but were all rejected by a small clique of the authorities in the Film Academy who are taking the capitalist road. Instead, they want us to follow Xia Yan's advocacy of the reactionary fallacy of "life is everywhere." In the observation of life courses in the directing and acting departments, we were assigned to go to the Tianqiao Entertainment Center in Beijing to observe life. There, magicians, acrobats, wrestlers, and all kinds of tourists became the objects of our observation and experience. We were also instructed to go to various markets, shops, and post offices, where it was said that there were gatherings of all kinds of characters. Students in the Fine Arts Department were not allowed to sketch the ten major buildings constructed during the Great Leap Forward but were instead directed to find the streets and buildings of Beijing from three hundred years ago to sketch. Students in the Acting Department were organized to participate in dances held by capitalists, observing and experiencing the decadent life of the bourgeoisie. Some students were even sent to the zoo to observe the lives of various animals all day, and then perform the characteristics of monkeys, bears, and flounder on stage... Look! Our revolutionary youth have been poisoned by Xia Yan and other counter-revolutionary revisionists into what state!

Chairman Mao said: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position." In a class society, there is no such thing as the abstract "life" talked about by the likes of Xia Yan, but only specific life, class life. It is either the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the life of the proletariat, or the life of the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must, in the process of going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and actual struggles, shift their standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat. Xia Yan and his ilk peddle Hu Feng's black goods of "life is everywhere," with the purpose of trying to drag us into the stinking mud of bourgeois life, making us sing the praises of the bourgeoisie and defame the proletariat, making us the successors of the bourgeoisie. Their evil intentions are so vicious!

    粉碎夏衍“到处有生活”的谬论
    红代会北京电影学院井冈山文艺兵团
    反革命修正主义分子夏衍与胡风一鼻孔出气，积极贩卖“到处有生活”的黑货，腐蚀和毒害革命文艺队伍。夏衍说：“胡风分子曾经提出‘到处有生活’，到处可以体验，不需要到火热斗争中去。他们这样提，主要是反对我们号召作家参加实际锻炼，参加火热斗争。但是，‘到处有生活’这句话本身却不一定全错，因为的确到处有各种各样的人，各种各样的生活。”夏衍名为反对胡风，实则鼓吹胡风的反动谬论。夏衍同胡风唱一个腔调，证明他们本来就是一丘之貉。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去……”在反革命修正主义文艺黑线的统治之下，只有夏衍之流大搞和平演变的自由，没有文艺工作者深入工农兵的权利。我们学校的革命师生多次要求按照毛主席的指示，下厂、下乡、下部队，同工农兵相结合，都被电影学院一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派加以拒绝，相反，他们要我们按照夏衍鼓吹的“到处有生活”的反动谬论去做。在导演、表演系的观察生活课上，我们被指定到北京天桥游艺场去观察生活。在那里，变戏法的，演杂技的，摔跤的，以及各种各样的游人成了我们观察体验的对象。我们还被指使到各个市场、商店和邮局去，据说那里也是各种人物形象丛集的地方。美术系的学生收集生活素材，不许画大跃进中兴建起来的十大建筑，而偏让他们去寻找北京三百年前的街道建筑去写生。表演系学生被组织去参加资本家们举办的舞会，观察和体验资产阶级的糜烂生活。有些学生甚至被派到动物园去，整天地观察各种动物的生活，然后在舞台上表演猴子、狗熊和比目鱼的性格特征……看！我们革命青年被夏衍等反革命修正主义分子毒害成了什么样子！
    毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活”。在阶级社会中，不存在夏衍之流所说的抽象的“生活”，而只有具体的生活，阶级的生活。不是工农兵的生活，无产阶级的生活，就是资产阶级的生活。革命的文艺工作者，要在深入工农兵群众，深入实际斗争的过程中，把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。夏衍之流贩卖胡风“到处有生活”的黑货，其目的就是妄想把我们拉进资产阶级生活的臭泥坑，让我们去歌颂资产阶级，去丑化无产阶级，要我们当资产阶级的接班人，他们的罪恶用心是多么狠毒！
