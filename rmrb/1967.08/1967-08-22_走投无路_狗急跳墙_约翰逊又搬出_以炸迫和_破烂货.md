The U.S. imperialist head Johnson's remarks at a press conference on August 18 show that U.S. imperialism, in its predicament in the Vietnam War, is continuing to play both the cards of escalating the war and the "peace talks" trick.

Recently, U.S. imperialism has been frantically escalating the Vietnam War. Apart from continuously bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and sending B-52 bombers to indiscriminately bomb the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it has also consecutively bombed Lang Son, which is very close to the Chinese border. At the press conference, Johnson loudly proclaimed that the U.S. must "provide the maximum deterrent force," threatening that "we believe if we are going to stay there (in Vietnam), it is very necessary to do everything we can."

When talking about the recent U.S. consecutive bombings of Lang Son, Johnson tried to cover up the U.S. imperialist plot to escalate the Vietnam War, claiming that "the U.S. does not want to expand the Vietnam War" and that the bombing targets were all "carefully chosen," etc. This once again exposed the U.S. imperialists' cowardly and shameless face.

At the same time, Johnson once again came out to peddle the "bombing for peace" trash. He said that if the Vietnamese side "agrees to a ceasefire" and "agrees to negotiations," the U.S. can "stop bombing." Johnson's trick is nothing but an old ploy to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and to cover up his plot to escalate the war.

Johnson held this press conference precisely when U.S. imperialism is facing increasingly serious difficulties in the Vietnam War. The U.S. aggressor troops are suffering defeats on the Vietnam battlefield, with losses mounting, and the U.S. cannot send many more troops. The U.S. imperialists' heavy defeats have caused great chaos and disputes within the U.S. ruling clique. Johnson is now in a desperate situation. At the press conference, Johnson could not help but admit that for the U.S., the situation is "becoming more and more difficult," and that "the longer the fighting continues, the more sacrifices in personnel and materials will be needed, the more differing opinions there will be, and the greater the difficulties will be."

    走投无路　狗急跳墙
    约翰逊又搬出“以炸迫和”破烂货
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美帝头子约翰逊十八日在记者招待会上的谈话表明，美帝国主义在侵越战争的困境中，要继续玩弄扩大战争冒险和“和谈”阴谋的两手。
    美帝国主义最近疯狂地进行侵越战争“升级”，除连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，派遣B—52型轰炸机滥炸越南民主共和国领土以外，还接连轰炸了距中国边境很近的谅山。约翰逊在记者招待会上竭力叫嚷美国要设法“提供最大的威慑力量”，他威胁说，“我们认为如果我们要呆在那里（越南），那就十分有必要做我们能做的一切事情”。
    在谈到美国最近连续轰炸谅山的侵略罪行时，约翰逊力图掩饰美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的阴谋，说什么“美国并不想扩大越南战争”，轰炸的目标都是“经过仔细选择的”等，这再次暴露了美帝国主义作贼心虚的卑劣嘴脸。
    同时，约翰逊又一次出来抛售“停炸诱和”的破烂货。他说什么如果越南方面“同意停火”，“同意谈判”，美国可以“停炸”。约翰逊的这一套，不过是诱迫越南人民投降，并掩盖其扩大战争阴谋的老把戏而已。
    约翰逊举行这次记者招待会，正是当美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到越来越严重困难的时候。美国侵略军在越南战场上节节失败，损失越来越大，而美国国内也增派不出多少兵力去。美帝的惨重失败，在美国统治集团内部引起了很大的混乱和争吵，约翰逊正处于四面楚歌的狼狈境地。约翰逊在记者招待会上也不得不承认，对于美国说来，局势在“变得愈益困难”，“事情将会越来越棘手，战斗持续得越长，在人员和物资方面所需要作出的牺牲就越多，不同的意见就越多，困难也就越大”。
