According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Burmese Embassy in China on August 10, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the Burmese reactionary government in recent months, which incited its military to arbitrarily kill seven Chinese border residents.

The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Ne Win reactionary government of Burma: (1) immediately punish the culprits; (2) compensate for all losses suffered by the victims and provide appropriate compensation to their families; (3) publicly apologize and immediately release the Chinese border residents who are still being illegally detained by the Burmese reactionary government, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

The note states: The Ne Win government of Burma, in order to intensify its reactionary policy of anti-communism, anti-people, pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China, has been carrying out malicious activities against the Chinese people in the China-Burma border region before it recently instigated large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities. In recent months, the Ne Win reactionary government has incited its military to kill seven Chinese border residents. According to reports from relevant departments of China:

1. Left Linxiang and his wife He Guozhi, border residents of Yunnan Province, China, went to the market on February 27 of this year, according to the historical custom of mutual exchange of necessities between the two countries' border residents. On the same day in the afternoon, they were arbitrarily arrested and taken to Ba Mo by more than 30 Burmese soldiers on their way back. Left Linxiang was brutally tortured to death in prison, and He Guozhi was not released until April 27.

2. On April 7 of this year, five border residents of Yunnan Province, China, Bo Fangban, Bo Huangban, Bo Jinshou, Ban Huang, and Bo Baohong, went out to visit relatives and friends and were shot and killed by a group of Burmese soldiers at the foot of the Burmese mountain. Their personal belongings and living necessities were also looted.

3. On July 1 of this year, five border residents of Yunnan Province, China, Yang Yongxiang, He Jinhua, Jiang Youxiang, Dong Deshan, and Yang Shengheng, went to the market according to the historical custom of mutual exchange of necessities between the two countries' border residents. On their way to the Burmese village of Lalong, the local Burmese soldiers shot at them without asking questions, killing Yang Yongxiang on the spot. The other four escaped, but the next day, Yang Yongxiang's brother and He Xiancai and two others went to retrieve the body and were also arrested by the Burmese soldiers.

The note states: The above-mentioned fascist atrocities of the Burmese military have aroused great indignation among the people of our country and the broad masses of border residents in the China-Burma border region.

The note states: It must be pointed out that the serious incident of the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government inciting the Burmese military to arbitrarily kill Chinese border residents is not accidental, but is a part of its deliberate plan to sabotage the relations between the two countries and to carry out its wanton anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities. Since the first half of this year, the Ne Win reactionary government has been pushing forward a fascist racist policy in the China-Burma border region, dispatching large numbers of military, police, and special agents along the border to search and arrest Chinese border residents, beat, rob, and even rape and burn, committing all kinds of evil deeds.

The note states: It is well known that the mutual market visits, visiting relatives and friends between the two countries' border residents in the China-Burma border region are naturally formed due to historical, ethnic, and other factors, and are their traditional customs for thousands of years. The Chinese government and relevant border authorities have always facilitated the coming and going of Burmese border residents. Now, the Ne Win reactionary government, disregarding the common interests of the two countries' border residents, arbitrarily sabotages the friendly exchanges between the two countries' border residents, and even repeatedly kills Chinese border residents, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and absolutely intolerable to the Burmese people.

The note concludes: We must solemnly warn the Ne Win reactionary government: You have not yet settled the account of killing Chinese experts in Burma, injuring Chinese diplomatic personnel, and persecuting overseas Chinese. Now you are pushing your anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities to the border region, and continuously creating serious incidents of killing Chinese border residents. You will not have a good end if you continue to act recklessly. If you insist on continuing your reckless behavior, you will surely reap what you sow and suffer double punishment. Do not say you were not warned!

    我外交部最强烈抗议奈温反动政府杀害我边民的法西斯暴行
    缅甸反动派疯狂反华必将受到加倍惩罚
    据新华社十日讯　中国外交部十日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，最强烈地抗议缅甸反动政府连月来唆使它的军队，无端杀害中国边民七人的法西斯暴行。
    中国政府严正要求缅甸奈温反动政府：（一）立即惩办凶手；（二）赔偿被害者的一切损失并给他们的家属应有的抚恤；（三）公开道歉，立即释放现在仍被缅甸反动政府无理关押的中国边民，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    照会说：缅甸奈温政府为了加紧推行反共、反人民、亲美、联苏、反华的反动政策，早在它最近制造的大规模反华排华暴行以前，就在中缅边境地区疯狂进行敌视中国人民的罪恶活动。连月来，奈温反动政府竟然唆使它的军队杀害中国边民七人。据中国有关部门报告：
    一、中国云南省盈江县边民左林相同他的妻子何国芝，于今年二月二十七日，按照两国边民在生活上互通有无的历史习惯外出赶街，同日下午在他们返回途中，被三十多名缅军无端逮捕，押解八莫。左林相被缅军残酷折磨，死于狱中，何国芝直到四月二十七日才被放回。
    二、中国云南省盈江县边民波方板、波荒板、波金寿、板荒、波保洪等五人于今年四月七日外出探亲访友，行经缅翁果山脚横遭一股缅军开枪杀害。他们随身携带的个人财物和生活用品也被劫走。
    三、中国云南省盈江县边民杨永祥、何金教、姜有祥、董德山、杨升恒等五人，今年七月一日同样按照两国边民生活上互通有无的历史习惯外出赶街，途经缅拉弄寨附近，当地缅军不问青红皂白即向他们开枪射击，杨永祥当场被打死，余四人幸免逃脱，但次日杨永祥的弟弟与何显才等三人前往收尸，又被缅军逮捕。
    照会说：上述缅军的法西斯暴行，激起了我国人民和中缅边境地区广大边民的极大愤怒。
    照会说：必须指出，缅甸奈温反动政府唆使缅军无端杀害中国边民的严重事件，绝不是偶然的，是它蓄意破坏两国关系，猖狂反华排华计划的组成部分。自今年上半年以来，奈温反动政府便在中缅边境地区疯狂地推行法西斯种族主义政策，派遣大批军警特务沿边界一带，对中国外出边民大肆搜捕，毒打抢劫，甚至奸淫烧杀，无恶不作。
    照会说：众所周知，中缅边境地区双方边民的赶街互市、探亲访友，是由于历史、民族等各种因素所自然形成的，是他们千百年来的传统习惯。中国政府和边境有关当局，对来往的缅甸边民一向给予方便。而现在，奈温反动政府竟然不顾两国边民的共同利益，恣意破坏两国边民的友好来往，甚至一再杀害中国边民，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，也是缅甸人民绝对不能容忍的。
    照会最后说：我们要严正警告奈温反动政府，你们杀害中国援缅专家，打伤中国外交人员，疯狂迫害华侨，这笔账还没有清算。现在你们又把反华排华的罪恶活动推向边境地区，连续制造杀害中国边民的严重事件。你们这样肆无忌惮地胡作非为，是决不会有好下场的。如果你们还要继续蛮干下去，你们必将自食其果，受到加倍的惩罚，勿谓言之不预也！
