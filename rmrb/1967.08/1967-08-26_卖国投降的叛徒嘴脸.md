	The Traitorous Face of Surrender and Betrayal

	In February 1946, at a critical juncture when China was at a crossroads between two destinies and two futures, the notorious "Report on the Current Situation" was released by the Chinese Khrushchev. This was a counter-revolutionary black manifesto advocating for peaceful transition and opposing armed seizure of power. This black report fully exposed his traitorous face of surrender and betrayal.

	Chairman Mao pointed out, "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." The Chinese Khrushchev has been scheming against this unshakable truth. As early as during the War of Resistance against Japan, he actively advocated for handing over the people's army to the leadership of the reactionary Kuomintang government, even shamelessly praising the tyrant Chiang Kai-shek as a "revolutionary flag." After the victory of the war, he became even more frenzied in opposing the armed seizure of power. In the "Report on the Current Situation," he peddled a large amount of "parliamentary road" black goods, rambling about a "new stage of peaceful democratic construction," singing high praises for peace, and attempting to disperse the revolutionary will of the people and surrender to the enemy. He blabbered about how "the party's entire work must undergo a transformation" and "all political issues must be resolved peacefully." What a "peaceful resolution"! The Chinese Khrushchev's "peaceful resolution" is to hand over the people's army and the people's guns to the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, allowing himself to go to the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek to be an official. If things are done this way, the hard-won fruits of our struggle in blood and sweat will be completely lost, and China will return to the old path of colonialism and semi-colonialism. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev said this was a "great historical victory" for the Chinese democratic revolution. Shut up! You old opportunist, betraying our revolutionary people, ruining the socialist future of China, and still calling it a "great historical victory," you are truly shameless!

	Chairman Mao taught us, "There is no room for compromise with the running dogs of imperialism, the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek, and their accomplices. Either we overthrow these enemies, or we are slaughtered and oppressed by them. There is no other way. Here, it is either you defeat me or I defeat you. This is a life-and-death class struggle, not some 'peaceful resolution.' Just at this critical juncture of the decisive battle between the two roads and two destinies, our great leader Chairman Mao severely criticized the surrenderist rhetoric of the Chinese Khrushchev, saying: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." He also said: "The people's weapons, every gun and every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." These words struck our hearts. This struggle between the two roads and two lines made us further realize that the Chinese Khrushchev is our revolutionary people's sworn enemy.

	While spreading illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Khrushchev also flatteringly praised the American imperialists, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people, spreading illusions about American imperialism. At that time, he published an article, blabbering about how the American government "sympathized with our war of resistance and helped our war of resistance," and even wanted to express "gratitude." This is sheer nonsense. Chairman Mao taught us: "Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their annihilation." During the war of resistance, American imperialism supported Chiang Kai-shek in attacking the liberated areas and even attempted to use Japanese imperialism to eliminate the Communist Party. As soon as the war ended, it provided Chiang Kai-shek with airplanes and cannons, helping Chiang Kai-shek to mobilize troops and launch a large-scale civil war, slaughtering the Chinese people. Countless facts prove that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and also the mortal enemy of the revolutionary people of the world. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev smeared it with makeup, dressing it up as a "peace angel," and even shamelessly said that American imperialism "needs 'peace' just as much as we do." Look, how is the Chinese Khrushchev any different from the Soviet Khrushchev?

	The Chinese Khrushchev's "Report on the Current Situation" is a direct opposition to Chairman Mao's "armed seizure of power," fiercely opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to lead the Chinese revolution astray, and trying to realize capitalism in China. This is intolerable!

	"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength." The Chinese Khrushchev is a scum of the Chinese nation and the number one agent of the bourgeoisie within our party. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating the "falling dog," and beat him to death in the water, making sure he never rises again!

    卖国投降的叛徒嘴脸
    上海工总司解放铜厂造反队员　崔阿炳
    一九四六年二月，正当中国处在两种命运、两个前途大决战的紧要关头，中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了臭名昭著的《时局问题的报告》。这是一个鼓吹和平过渡、反对武装夺取政权的反革命黑纲领。这个黑报告，充分暴露了他卖国投降的叛徒嘴脸。
    毛主席指出，“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”中国赫鲁晓夫处心积虑反对这一颠扑不破的真理。早在抗日战争时期，他就积极主张把人民的军队交给国民党反动政府“领导”，甚至无耻吹捧独夫民贼蒋介石是什么“革命的旗帜”。抗战胜利以后，他更加疯狂地反对武装夺取政权。在《时局问题的报告》里，他大量贩卖“议会道路”黑货，侈谈什么“和平民主建设的新阶段”，大唱和平高调，妄图涣散革命人民的战斗意志，向敌人妥协投降。他胡说什么现在“党的全部工作要实行转变”，“一切政治问题要和平解决”。好一个“和平解决”！中国赫鲁晓夫的“和平解决”，就是要把人民的军队，人民的枪杆子交给蒋介石反动政府，让他自己到蒋介石反动政府去做官。照这样办，我们流血流汗奋斗来的胜利果实，就要全部丧失，中国又要回到殖民地半殖民地的老路去。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却说什么这是中国民主革命一次“伟大的历史胜利”。住口！你这个老牌机会主义分子，出卖我们革命人民，葬送中国的社会主义前途，还说这是“伟大的历史胜利”，真是死不要脸！
    毛主席教导我们，“和帝国主义的走狗蒋介石国民党及其帮凶们决无妥协的余地，或者是推翻这些敌人，或者是被这些敌人所屠杀和压迫，二者必居其一，其他的道路是没有的。”这里，不是你战胜我，就是我打败你，这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，而绝不是什么“和平解决”。就在这两条道路、两种命运决战的紧急关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席严厉批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的投降论调，他说：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”又说：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”这话说到了我们的心坎里。这场两条道路、两条路线的斗争，使我们进一步认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫是我们革命人民不共戴天的仇敌。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在散布对蒋介石的幻想的同时，还肉麻地吹捧双手沾满中国人民鲜血的美帝国主义，散布对美帝国主义的幻想。当时他曾发表文章，胡说什么美国政府“同情我们的抗战，帮助我们的抗战”，还要表示“感谢”。简直混蛋透顶。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”在抗战时期，美帝国主义支持蒋介石进攻解放区，并且妄图借日本帝国主义之手消灭共产党。抗战刚刚结束，它又给蒋介石飞机大炮，帮助蒋介石调兵遣将，发动大规模内战，屠杀中国人民。无数事实证明，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，也是世界革命人民的死敌。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却给它涂脂抹粉，把它打扮成“和平天使”，甚至恬不知耻地说，美帝国主义“与我们同样需要”“和平”。请看，中国赫鲁晓夫与苏联赫鲁晓夫有什么两样？
    中国赫鲁晓夫的《时局问题的报告》，就是同毛主席的“武装夺取政权”唱对台戏，猖狂反对伟大的毛泽东思想，企图把中国革命引入歧途，妄想在中国实现资本主义。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”。中国赫鲁晓夫是中华民族的败类，是资产阶级在我们党内的头号代理人。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把他打死在水里，叫他永远爬不起来！
