We, the entire company of soldiers, heard from the radio the latest instructions from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Commander Lin Biao, and our hearts are filled with immense excitement. Vice Commander Lin Biao's latest instructions are the new battle cry to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Vice Commander Lin Biao's latest instructions have pointed out a new direction for the entire army to raise the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level. This is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest motivation for us. We are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joyfully shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

Forty years ago, Vice Commander Lin Biao was our company's first commander. Under his wise leadership, our company followed Chairman Mao from victory to victory. In July 1959, Vice Commander Lin Biao visited the company and personally inscribed a message encouraging us. Today, our beloved old commander, Vice Commander Lin Biao, has given us the latest instruction to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We will resolutely carry out and implement this instruction.

From the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that the revolutionary criticism campaign is a living classroom and a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the current campaign to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, we must study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, achieve new results, reach new heights, create new experiences, advance to a new stage, and further establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

We must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, thoroughly smash the reactionary bourgeois military line advocated by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and thoroughly eliminate its poisonous influence. Only in this way can we ensure that our People's Liberation Army will forever be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's military line.

Thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters is a great strategic task for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. In the revolutionary criticism campaign, we must humbly learn from the revolutionary young guards, breathe the same air, share the same fate, and forever be united with them, fight with them, and win with them. We must be their strong backbone. We must do an even better job in supporting the left, and excellently complete the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries."

Finally, all the soldiers of our company solemnly pledge to the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Commander Lin Biao: We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Commander Lin Biao's instructions, and will not disappoint the Party and the people's expectations. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new merits for the people in the great battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and build new achievements. We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    在革命大批判中立新功
    广州部队某部　钢铁红二连
    我们全连同志，从广播里听到了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅的最新指示，心情无比振奋。林副统帅的最新指示，是彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的新的战斗号令。林副统帅的最新指示，为全军把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段指明了新的方向。这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。我们满怀革命豪情纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    四十年前，林副统帅是我们连第一任连长，在林副统帅的英明指挥下，我们连队紧跟毛主席从胜利走向胜利。一九五九年七月二日，林副统帅回连探望，曾亲笔题词，勉励我们。今天，我们敬爱的老首长林副统帅又向我们发出了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的最新指示，我们要坚决执行，坚决照办。
    我们从无产阶级文化大革命的实践中深深地体会到，革命的大批判运动，是活学活用毛主席著作的活课堂、大学校。在当前彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的革命大批判中，我们要更加努力学习毛主席著作，要学出新成果，用出新水平，创造出新经验，推向新阶段，进一步树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    我们要更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，彻底摧毁彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的反动的资产阶级军事路线，彻底肃清它的流毒。这样，才能保证我们人民解放军永远无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，永远沿着毛主席的军事路线胜利前进。
    彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，是全党全军全国人民的伟大战略任务。在革命的大批判中，我们要虚心向革命小将学习，和革命群众同呼吸，共命运，永远心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，永远做他们的强大后盾。我们要把支左工作做得好上加好，出色地完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。
    最后，我们全连指战员向伟大领袖毛主席和林副统帅庄严宣誓：我们要永远牢记毛主席的教导和林副统帅的指示，决不辜负党和人民的希望，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗中，为人民立新功，建新劳，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
