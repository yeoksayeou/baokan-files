After the proletariat seizes power, there are two fundamentally opposing lines in building one's own country.

One is the modern revisionist line of the Soviet Union, which emphasizes only material production, machinery, mechanization, and even material incentives. This line opposes the prominence of proletarian politics, erases class struggle, and abolishes the dictatorship of the proletariat. Following this line, one cannot advance towards socialism but can only regress towards capitalism. The traitorous clique of Khrushchev in the Soviet Union and its successors are ardent advocates of this line. The Chinese Khrushchev, in tandem with the Soviet Khrushchev, also vigorously promotes this line in our country, aiming to restore capitalism.

Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has resolutely criticized this revisionist line and proposed a single correct Marxist-Leninist line. In 1949, Chairman Mao, in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, already put forward the basic policy for socialist economic construction. In this report, Chairman Mao analyzed the situation of various economic components at that time and proposed to "make the state-owned economy the leading component of the entire national economy," gradually carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually complete the basic path of socialist industrialization. In 1958, Chairman Mao further reflected the firm resolve and great wisdom of the 700 million people of our country, formulated the general line of "building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and excellent work," and proposed a set of policies for developing socialist construction, such as "walking on two legs." This opened up a new situation of great leaps forward in our country's socialist construction. In 1960, Chairman Mao personally summarized the experience of advanced enterprises in the Great Leap Forward and proposed the famous "Anshan Constitution," which is opposed to the "Magnitogorsk Constitution" of the Soviet revisionists. It established five basic principles: political leadership, strengthening party leadership, mass movements, implementing the "two participations and one reform, three combinations," and technological revolution. In 1963, Chairman Mao further proposed that "class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state." Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions have indicated the correct course for building our country. This line emphasizes the prominence of proletarian politics, carries out the struggle between the two classes and two roads to the end, and continuously consolidates and strengthens the dictatorship of the proletariat, promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking, and leads mechanization with revolutionization, "grasp revolution and promote production." It is under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that our great motherland has achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction, the socialist economic foundation has been continuously consolidated and developed, and ensures that the proletarian state will remain unchanged for thousands of generations.

Since the founding of the country, there has been a sharp and intense struggle between these two lines on the economic front in our country. The focus of the struggle is: whether to emphasize proletarian politics, whether to have proletarian politics in command, and whether to build our country according to the great thought of Mao Zedong. The essence of the struggle is, in the end, whether to build a socialist economy or a capitalist economy; whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao leads us to build a socialist country and has always placed the revolutionization of people in the primary position. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without a correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." To develop socialist production, there are thousands of methods, but the most important one is to grasp the revolution in political thought. If this is done well, grain, cotton, oil, steel, coal, and everything else will increase. If this is not done well, nothing will increase. Spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the masses is the fundamental guarantee of the victory of our country's socialist construction.

The Chinese Khrushchev, however, does the opposite, vigorously opposing proletarian politics in command, and slandering our country's methods of leading economic construction as "extra-economic methods," advocating "managing the economy with economic methods." He viciously accuses: "Why must it be managed administratively and not economically?" There has never been a purely economic method in the world that does not belong to a certain politics. In a class society, no field will be a vacuum. Any department, any field, if it is not proletarian politics in command, it will necessarily be bourgeois politics in command; if it is not Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in command, it will necessarily be revisionism and capitalist thought in command. The Chinese Khrushchev opposes proletarian politics in command and wants bourgeois politics in command, with the purpose of restoring capitalism.

Let's analyze the prescription of the so-called "managing the economy with economic methods" by the Chinese Khrushchev. What does it contain?

This is "profit in command," everything for money, money is everything. The Chinese Khrushchev openly declares: "A factory must definitely make money, if it doesn't make money, it should close down and stop paying wages." To make money, one can disregard the national unified plan and the overall interests, and do all kinds of things that harm others and benefit oneself, cheat, and sabotage the socialist economy.

This is the stench of copper coins, "material incentives." The Chinese Khrushchev, in the tone of a capitalist, says: "Honestly working people should be rewarded a little," "without adding a little money, production enthusiasm is not enough, don't produce well for you." He tries to corrupt the masses with bourgeois selfishness, divert the masses' attention from politics, expand income disparities, and create a special stratum. This is a great insult to the revolutionary masses of workers, this is a soft knife that kills without blood!

This is the shameless beautification of capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly says that "capitalist economy is flexible and diverse," "we should learn from the experience of capitalist management of enterprises, especially monopolistic enterprises," he wants our staff to "seriously learn from" them, saying that their "management ability exceeds that of our Communist Party members." In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, capitalists who are greedy for profit are a hundred times more brilliant than Communist Party members.

The so-called "managing the economy with economic methods," in a word, is to let the law of value of capitalism dominate everything, develop free competition, sabotage the socialist economy, and restore capitalism. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's "economic methods," the capitalists who were frowning will smile again, the workers who have stood up will become slaves again, and a new batch of bourgeois elements will rebuild their "paradise" on the bones of tens of thousands of laboring people.

The Chinese Khrushchev's opposition to political leadership is also prominently manifested in his opposition to mass movements. The socialist cause is the revolutionary cause of tens of millions of people. To build a socialist economy, one must mobilize and rely on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broadest masses. Whether or not to carry out mass movements is an important sign of whether or not to implement proletarian politics in command, and it is also an important aspect of the fundamental opposition between the two economic construction lines.

Our great leader Chairman Mao most believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and respects the pioneering spirit of the masses. He teaches us: "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." "Every work must be done with mass movements, without mass movements it will not work." It is precisely because we insist on political leadership and carry out mass movements that we have a thriving Great Leap Forward and can achieve rapid development in industry, agriculture, national defense, science, and culture. The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, hates the revolutionary mass movements and vigorously advocates the "one-man management system" and the reactionary "expert line." In 1949, he went to Tianjin and told the employees of state-owned enterprises: "You are the organizers of the state in the factory," and to build the country, one must "especially rely on the factory director, engineer, and technician." In a speech in 1952, he said: "There are many difficulties in industrial construction. China has money, labor, and machines (which can be basically solved with the help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries), but there are no engineers." He fiercely attacked the high tide of revolutionary mass movements after 1958, shot cold arrows, and maliciously said that carrying out mass movements was "a sudden surge," "just heard a little wind, heard a little unreliable news, and it surged."

In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, economic construction can only rely on a few "experts," "rely on the factory director, engineer, and technician," and they issue orders, while the broad masses of revolutionaries are just "labor power," are "mob" that "surge suddenly," and can only obediently "follow orders." They rack their brains to formulate a set of revisionist methods and regulations, everywhere implement rules and regulations to control and restrict people, and implement bourgeois dictatorship on workers. They do this, not only to restrain the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, hinder the development of socialist economic construction, but also to make a few cadres, managers, and technicians stand in opposition to the masses of workers, gradually evolve into bureaucratism and new bourgeois elements who ride on the heads of the masses, and gradually change the nature of socialist enterprises.

This is the struggle between the two fundamentally opposing economic construction lines in our country.

Marxism tells us: politics is the concentrated expression of economics. The degeneration of the socialist economic base will inevitably lead to the restoration of capitalism in politics. The line, policies, measures, and methods that the Chinese Khrushchev has advocated on the economic front for many years are all aimed at fostering capitalist forces in cities and countryside, sabotaging the socialist economic base, and attempting to degenerate the socialist economy into a capitalist economy. Once the economy degenerates, it will gradually change the color of our party and our country, and restore capitalism throughout China. Therefore, the struggle between the two economic construction lines is actually a struggle between two political lines, two roads, and two destinies of China.

Our proletarian party is to engage in politics, class struggle, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. If we follow the advocacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, bury our heads in economic construction, do not engage in politics, do not engage in class struggle, do not engage in the dictatorship of the proletariat, then our party, will it not also become a mere tool for organizing economic life, become a "party of industry" and "party of agriculture" like the Soviet revisionist traitor clique? The party is the highest form of class organization and a tool for class struggle. This is a common sense of Marxism. Where in the world is there a party that only engages in production and construction and does not engage in class struggle? The so-called "party of industry" and "party of agriculture" are nothing more than to make the party a subordinate of economic construction and a subordinate of the bourgeoisie, always following the "profit" buttocks. The sole purpose of this party is to make money, exploit, and engage in capitalism. Such a party is not also a genuine bourgeois party?

The facts of the struggle between the two lines on the economic front educate us that we must always firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions, never forget to emphasize politics, and always put politics in the first place.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We admit that in the general development of history, material things determine spiritual things, and social existence determines social consciousness; but at the same time, we also admit and must admit the reaction of spiritual things, the reaction of social consciousness on social existence, the reaction of the superstructure on the economic base." In contemporary times, the most powerful spiritual force is the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and the most powerful fighting force is the people armed with the thought of Mao Zedong. Those who only see material force will be frightened by a few new weapons of the enemy in the war years, and will shamelessly kneel and surrender; in the construction period, they will believe in foreigners, follow in the footsteps of foreigners, and obediently become slaves of foreigners. While we Chinese Communists firmly believe that the people are the creators of history, once the people grasp the thought of Mao Zedong, they will become the smartest and bravest, and can exert endless power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is the best classroom for studying and applying the thought of Mao Zedong, and is a great driving force for the development of social productivity in our country. Through this cultural revolution, the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev in economic construction has been thoroughly eliminated, and with the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the proletarian dictatorship, a great new upsurge in socialist construction will surely emerge. "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," and all imperialist and revisionist countries will be far behind us!

    两条根本对立的经济建设路线
   《文汇报》编辑部　《解放日报》编辑部　《支部生活》编辑部
    无产阶级取得政权以后，怎样建设自己的国家，存在着两条根本对立的路线。
    一条是苏联现代修正主义路线，只强调搞物质，搞机器，搞机械化，还搞什么物质刺激。这条路线，反对突出无产阶级政治，抹煞阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政。照这条路线走去，不可能走向社会主义，而只能走向资本主义。苏联赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团及其继承人，就是这条路线的狂热的鼓吹者。中国赫鲁晓夫同苏联赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，也拚命地在我国推行这条路线，复辟资本主义。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，坚决批判了这一条修正主义路线，提出了一条唯一正确的马克思列宁主义的路线。一九四九年，毛主席在《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中，就已经提出了社会主义经济建设的基本方针。毛主席在这个报告中着重分析了当时中国各种经济成份的状况，提出了要“使国营经济成为整个国民经济的领导成份”，逐步进行农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，逐步完成社会主义工业化的基本道路。一九五八年，毛主席进一步集中反映了我国七亿人民的坚定决心和伟大智慧，制定了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，提出了发展社会主义建设的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，开创了我国社会主义建设大跃进的崭新局面。一九六○年，毛主席亲自总结了大跃进中先进企业创造的经验，提出了同苏修“马钢宪法”相对立的著名的“鞍钢宪法”，确定了五项基本原则，就是：坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，实行两参一改三结合，大搞技术革命。一九六三年，毛主席又提出了“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动”。毛主席的一系列光辉指示，指明了建设我们国家的正确航道。这条路线，强调突出无产阶级政治，把两个阶级、两条道路的斗争进行到底，不断地巩固和加强无产阶级专政，促进人的思想革命化，用革命化来领导机械化，“抓革命，促生产”。正是在毛主席革命路线的指引下，我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设取得了辉煌的成就，社会主义的经济基础不断地得到巩固和发展，保证我们无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色。
    建国以来，在我国经济战线上，这两条路线一直存在着尖锐、激烈的斗争。斗争的焦点就是：要不要突出无产阶级政治，要不要无产阶级政治挂帅，是不是按照伟大的毛泽东思想来建设我们的国家。斗争的实质，归根到底，是搞社会主义经济，还是搞资本主义经济；是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路。
    毛主席领导我们建设社会主义国家，从来都把人的革命化放在首要地位。毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”我们要发展社会主义的生产，办法有千条万条，而最最重要的一条，就是抓政治思想的革命。这一条搞上去了，粮、棉、油、钢铁、煤炭都能上去。这一条搞不上去，什么都上不去。把毛泽东思想传播给群众，这是我国社会主义建设胜利的根本保证。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之，竭力反对无产阶级政治挂帅，污蔑我们国家领导经济建设的办法是“超经济的办法”，提倡“按经济办法管理经济”。他恶狠狠地指责说：“为什么非按行政办法管理，不按经济办法管理？”世界上从来就没有什么不属于一定的政治的单纯的经济。在阶级社会中，社会的各个领域都不会是真空的。任何部门、任何领域，不是无产阶级政治挂帅，就必然是资产阶级政治挂帅；不是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想挂帅，就必然是修正主义、资本主义思想挂帅。中国赫鲁晓夫反对无产阶级政治挂帅，而要资产阶级政治挂帅，其目的就是为了复辟资本主义。
    我们再来剖析一下中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“按经济办法管理经济”的这张药方，究竟包罗了一些什么货色呢？
    这就是“利润挂帅”，一切为了赚钱，赚钱就是一切。中国赫鲁晓夫公然宣称：“一个工厂一定要赚钱，不赚钱就应关门，停发工资。”为了赚钱，可以不顾国家统一计划，不顾整体利益，干出种种损人利己、投机取巧，破坏社会主义经济的勾当来。
    这就是铜臭熏天的“物质刺激”。中国赫鲁晓夫用资本家的腔调说：“老老实实劳动的好好奖励他一下”，“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产”。他企图用资产阶级利己主义来腐蚀群众，转移群众对政治的注意力，扩大收入的差别，造成特殊阶层。这是对革命的职工群众的一种莫大侮辱，这是一把杀人不见血的软刀子！
    这就是无耻地美化资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫无耻地说什么
  “资本主义经济灵活、多样”，“资本主义管理企业的经验，特别是垄断企业的经验要学习”，他要我们的工作人员向资本家“认真学习”，说他们的“管理能力超过我们的共产党员”。在中国赫鲁晓夫眼里，利欲熏心的资本家竟比共产党员高明一百倍。
    所谓“按经济办法管理经济”，说穿了，这就是让资本主义的价值规律支配一切，发展自由竞争，破坏社会主义经济，复辟资本主义。如果照着中国赫鲁晓夫这一套“经济办法”办事，愁眉苦脸的资本家又将眼笑眉开，已经翻身了的工人阶级又得当牛做马，一批新的资产阶级分子将重新在成千上万劳动人民的白骨堆上建筑起他们的“天堂”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对政治挂帅，还突出地表现为反对大搞群众运动。社会主义事业是千百万群众的革命事业。建设社会主义的经济，就必须发动和依靠最广大群众的革命积极性。要不要大搞群众运动，这是实行不实行无产阶级政治挂帅的一个重要标志，也是两条经济建设路线根本对立的一个重要方面。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。他教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”“什么工作都要搞群众运动，没有群众运动是不行的。”正因为坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，我们才有轰轰烈烈的大跃进，才能在工业、农业、国防、科学文化等各条战线上获得突飞猛进的发展。中国赫鲁晓夫，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，十分仇恨革命的群众运动，拚命鼓吹“一长制”和反动的“专家路线”。一九四九年，他跑到天津，对国营企业职员说：“你们是国家在工厂中的组织者”，搞建设要“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”。一九五二年的一次讲话中，他又说：“建设工业有很多困难，中国是有钱，有劳动力，有机器（在苏联与人民民主国家帮助下基本可解决），就是没有工程师。”他对一九五八年以后革命群众运动的高潮更是拚命攻击，大放冷箭，胡说大搞群众运动是“一轰而起”，“只是从那里听了点风，听到了一点不确切的消息，就轰起来了”。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，搞经济建设只能依靠少数“专家”，“依靠厂长、工程师和技师”，由他们这些人发号施令，而广大的革命群众只是“劳动力”，是“一轰而起”的“群氓”，只能乖乖地“服从指挥”。他们挖空心思地制定了一套修正主义的办法、条例，处处搞管人、卡人的规章制度，对工人实行资产阶级专政。他们这样干，不仅束缚群众的社会主义积极性，阻碍社会主义经济建设的发展，而且使少数干部、管理人员、技术人员同工人群众处于对立的地位，逐步演变成为骑在群众头上的官僚主义分子和新的资产阶级分子，使社会主义企业逐步变质。
    这就是我国两条根本对立的经济建设路线的斗争。
    马克思主义告诉我们：政治是经济的集中表现。社会主义经济基础的蜕变必然导致政治上资本主义的复辟。中国赫鲁晓夫多年来在经济战线上鼓吹的一套路线、方针、政策、措施，都是为了扶植城乡的资本主义势力，破坏社会主义的经济基础，企图使社会主义经济蜕化成为资本主义经济。而经济一旦蜕变，必然会逐步地使我们党，我们国家都改变颜色，在整个中国复辟资本主义。因而两条经济建设路线的斗争，实际上是两条政治路线的斗争，两条道路的斗争，两个中国命运的斗争。
    我们的无产阶级政党，就是搞政治、搞阶级斗争，搞无产阶级专政的。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的主张，一头埋在经济建设里，不搞政治，不搞阶级斗争，不搞无产阶级专政，那么，我们的党，岂不也成了单纯组织经济生活的工具，成了苏修叛徒集团那样的“工业党”和
  “农业党”了吗？政党是阶级组织的最高形式，是进行阶级斗争的工具，这是马克思主义的常识。世界上哪里有只搞生产建设、不搞阶级斗争的政党呢？所谓“工业党”、“农业党”，无非就是要党成为经济建设的附庸，成为资产阶级的附庸，成天跟着“利润”的屁股打转转。这个党的唯一宗旨，就是搞钞票，搞剥削，搞资本主义。这样的党，不也成了地地道道的资产阶级政党了吗？
    经济战线上两条路线斗争的事实教育我们，必须永远牢牢记住毛主席的教导，念念不忘突出政治，任何时候都要把政治放在首位。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们承认总的历史发展中是物质的东西决定精神的东西，是社会的存在决定社会的意识；但是同时又承认而且必须承认精神的东西的反作用，社会意识对于社会存在的反作用，上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用。”在当代，最强大的精神力量就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，最强大的战斗力，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，那种只看到物质力量的人，在战争年代，就会被敌人的一两件新式武器吓得浑身发抖，无耻地屈膝投降；在建设时期，就会迷信洋人，跟着洋人的脚印爬行，服服贴贴地做洋人的奴隶。而我们中国共产党人，坚定地相信人民群众是历史的创造者，人民群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就会变得最聪明、最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这次无产阶级文化大革命，是活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的大课堂，是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。通过这次文化大革命，彻底肃清了中国赫鲁晓夫在经济建设方面的资产阶级反动路线，随着无产阶级政权的不断巩固和加强，必将出现一个伟大的社会主义建设新高潮。“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”，一切帝国主义、修正主义国家都必将远远地抛在我们后面！　（新华社上海二十四日电）
