	Resolutely Follow Chairman Mao's Words, Believe and Rely on the Great People's Liberation Army

	The Revolutionary Masses of the Civil Aviation Administration

	Actively Assist and Support the Army

	In January of this year, the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force responded to the great call of Chairman Mao, the great leader, to "support the broad leftist masses." They came to our Civil Aviation Administration.

	The army arrived, and the office immediately became lively. The most pressing question for all the mass organizations was the army's stance. People were watching to see which side the army would stand on and which faction it would support.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All conclusions come at the end of the investigation of the situation, not at the beginning." The comrades of the army need a process of understanding the situation and a certain amount of time to make a statement. We absolutely do not apply pressure to the army on the issue of making a statement. We believe that it is important to use our own actions to show ourselves and help the army understand us. We revolutionary masses have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and actively and voluntarily reported the situation to the army, closely cooperated with their work, and provided convenience for them to investigate and study the situation quickly and familiarize themselves with it. In this way, the comrades of the army, using the viewpoint of class analysis and the "Sixteen Points" as the standard, after a period of observation and understanding, finally identified the leftist mass organizations that were temporarily relatively weak in the Civil Aviation Administration and gave them firm support. The comrades of the army first believed in and supported us politically and ideologically, leading us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Under their help, our thoughts have improved, our organization has gradually grown stronger, and now the leftist mass organizations in the Civil Aviation Administration have achieved a revolutionary great union.

	Turn the Army's Support into Concrete Actions for the Cultural Revolution

	The army's support for us is a great thing. However, how to correctly treat this support is a severe test for us revolutionary masses.

	Due to the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, some of our comrades, for a period of time, did not correctly recognize and treat the army's support, and produced some wrong ideas. For example, some thought that since the army supported us, they were prominent leftists. Some thought that since the army supported us, they raised their tails high and did not listen to different opinions. Some even thought that since the army supported us, the situation was settled, and victory was in hand, relaxing their revolutionary vigilance against the frenzied counterattack of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. When dealing with different opinions and deceived masses, they also used simple and rigid methods, and so on.

	Faced with these situations, with the help of the comrades of the army and revolutionary cadres, we conducted a small rectification campaign and studied Chairman Mao's works in combination with actual conditions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." He also says: "Humility makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." Chairman Mao's teachings made us understand that "humility" and "arrogance" are the conditions for the transformation of advanced and backward elements. If we become arrogant because of the army's support, it becomes a burden, then we will turn from advanced to backward, turning a good thing into a bad thing.

	In dealing with the issue of the army supporting the leftist masses, some people still have a very harmful and extremely wrong idea. They think that "supporting the left" means supporting "me," and supporting "me" means supporting the "left." They use this to determine their attitude towards the army. When supporting "me," they shout "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" When not supporting "me," they doubt the army, and even want to drive the army away. We revolutionary masses believe that the army's support for whom and not supporting whom is not based on "me," but on Mao Zedong Thought as the standard. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and insists on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will definitely receive the support of the army. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to draw correct conclusions about the army's support for the left without Mao Zedong Thought.

	Focus on the Essence and See the Main Trend

	The People's Liberation Army is an army personally created and led by Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, an army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, an army that serves the people completely and thoroughly. They actively participated in and defended the Cultural Revolution, and made great contributions and achieved great successes in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," producing many heroic and exemplary figures like Cai Yongqiang and Lü Xiangbo, who used their lives to defend the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the main trend, the essence. However, the unprecedented Cultural Revolution is an extremely complex and sharp class struggle. The People's Liberation Army, in such a new task, may, due to lack of experience, make this or that mistake. How to deal with the shortcomings and errors in the army's support for the left is a political stance issue facing every mass organization and every individual.

	We, the revolutionary masses of the Civil Aviation Administration, have always believed that it is inevitable for the army to make some mistakes in their support work, which are non-essential, partial, temporary, and correctable. For their shortcomings and errors, we should, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, adopt the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," with a benevolent and realistic attitude, use appropriate methods to point them out, and help them correct their mistakes.

	We revolutionary masses must understand that our country is able to carry out such a world-unique, world-shaking proletarian cultural revolution, all thanks to the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, all thanks to the strong proletarian dictatorship, and all thanks to the great People's Liberation Army of China, which "stands firmly with the Chinese people and serves the Chinese people wholeheartedly." The unity of the army and the people is like one person; see who can defeat us! We revolutionary masses must enthusiastically respond to the Party Central Committee's great call to "support the army and love the people," and protect the People's Liberation Army's lofty prestige like protecting our eyes, prevent the class enemy from deliberately directing their spears at the army, and prevent the enemy from sowing discord between the army and the people, and sabotaging the proletarian dictatorship. We revolutionary masses, no matter when and where, must always remember the wise teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

	Learn Humbly from the Army

	The people of the whole country should learn from the army. This is the solemn call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao to us. This is also the fundamental attitude of the leftist mass organizations towards the army.

	The army is good in every way, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the best. We learn from the army, and first of all, we should learn from their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, their deep class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought, and learn from them to always put proletarian politics first and grasp the living thoughts. After the comrades of the army came to the office, they did not rush to make a statement but conducted thorough and detailed investigations and studies, and finally took decisive action to support the left. At that time, some people did not understand the army's actions and even took unfriendly attitudes. At this time, the comrades of the army did not discriminate against them but won them over through detailed ideological work. For example, at one time, some individuals had complaints about the army not supporting them, and the comrades of the army, according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasping ideological education is the central link for uniting the whole party to carry out great political struggles," actively approached the masses through labor, heart-to-heart talks, and other activities. Because they continuously carried out in-depth and detailed ideological work, now the broad masses in the general office have clarified the direction of the struggle.

	We, the revolutionary masses of the Civil Aviation Administration, deeply feel in the class struggle of the past year that the People's Liberation Army is the most reliable person and the best example for us to learn from. We resolutely follow the words of the great leader Chairman Mao: believe and rely on the People's Liberation Army. We are determined to always, always unite with the army, fight with the army, and win with the army!

    坚决听毛主席的话，相信和依靠伟大的人民解放军
    民航总局机关无产阶级革命派
    积极协助和支持解放军
    今年一月，中国人民解放军空军某部指战员，响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，来到了我们民航总局机关。
    解放军来了，机关里顿时沸腾起来。各群众组织最最关心的问题是解放军的表态，人们注视着解放军到底站在哪一边，支持哪一派。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头。”解放军同志表态需要一个了解情况的过程，需要一定时间。我们绝不在表态问题上，对解放军施加压力。我们认为，重要的是要用自己的实际行动给自己亮相，帮助解放军了解我们。我们无产阶级革命派始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，并积极主动向解放军如实反映情况，密切配合他们的工作，处处为他们作调查研究，尽快熟悉情况，提供方便。这样，解放军同志运用阶级分析的观点，以“十六条”为标准，经过一段时间的观察了解，终于辨别出了当时民航总局机关暂时还比较弱小的左派群众组织，并给以坚决的支持。解放军同志首先从政治上、思想上相信和支持我们，带领我们活学活用毛主席著作。在他们帮助下，我们的思想有了提高，我们的组织逐步发展壮大起来，现在已使民航总局机关左派群众组织实现了革命的大联合。       
    把解放军的支持转化为搞好文化大革命的具体行动
    解放军支持我们，这是件大好事。但是，如何正确对待这种支持，这是对我们无产阶级革命派的一个严峻考验。
    由于资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的作怪，使得我们有些同志在一段时间里没有正确认识和对待解放军的支持，产生了一些错误思想。例如：有的认为解放军支持了我们，就以为自己是响当当的左派。有的认为解放军支持了，就把尾巴翘得老高老高，听不进不同意见。甚至有人认为解放军支持了我们，大局已定，胜利在握，松懈了对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂反扑的革命警惕性。对待不同观点和受蒙蔽的群众，也采用简单生硬的作法，等等。
    面临这些情况，在解放军同志和革命的领导干部帮助下，我们进行了小整风，结合实际学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”又说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。毛主席的教导，使我们懂得了“虚心”和“骄傲”就是先进和落后互相转化的条件。如果因为有了解放军的支持，就骄傲起来，变成包袱，那就会由先进变为落后，把好事变为坏事。
    在对待解放军支持左派群众这个问题上，有些人还存在着一种极为有害、极端错误的思想。他们认为“支左”必支“我”，支“我”即支“左”。并以此来决定对待解放军的态度。支“我”时，就高喊“解放军万岁！”不支“我”时，就怀疑解放军，甚至要赶解放军。我们无产阶级革命派认为，解放军支持谁与不支持谁，不是以“我”为标准，而是以毛泽东思想这个真理为标准。凡符合毛泽东思想的，坚持毛主席无产阶级革命路线的，就必定会得到解放军的支持。因此，离开毛泽东思想去衡量解放军的支左工作，是绝对不会得出正确的结论来的。
    抓本质看主流
    人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，由林副主席直接指挥的人民军队，是一支无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线的军队，是完全、彻底为人民服务的军队。他们积极参加、保卫文化大革命，在“三支”、“两军”中，作出了巨大的贡献，取得了重大的成就，出现了许许多多象蔡永祥、吕祥璧等用生命保卫无产阶级文化大革命的可歌可泣的英雄模范人物。这是主流，是本质。但是，史无前例的文化大革命，是一场极为错综复杂、十分尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。人民解放军在这样一项崭新的工作中，因为缺乏经验，可能出现这样或那样的缺点、错误。如何对待解放军支左工作中的缺点、错误，这是摆在每个群众组织和每个人面前的政治立场问题。
    我们民航总局机关无产阶级革命派，始终如一地认为，解放军在支左工作中发生一些缺点、错误，是难免的，是非本质的、局部的、暂时的，并且是能够纠正的。对于他们的缺点、错误，我们应该按照毛主席的教导，采用“团结——批评——团结”的方针，抱着与人为善，实事求是的态度，采取适当的方式，向他们提出，帮助他们改正错误。
    我们无产阶级革命派必须懂得，我国所以能够开展这样一场举世无双、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，全靠我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，全靠有强大的无产阶级专政，全靠有“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的伟大的中国人民解放军。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌！我们无产阶级革命派，一定要热烈响应党中央关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，象爱护眼睛一样，坚决维护人民解放军的崇高威信，严防阶级敌人蓄意把矛头对准解放军。严防敌人挑拨军民关系，破坏无产阶级专政。我们无产阶级革命派，无论何时何地也要牢牢记住伟大统帅毛主席的英明教导：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    虚心向解放军学习
    全国人民要向解放军学习。这是伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的庄严号召。这也是左派群众组织对待解放军的根本态度。
    解放军千好万好，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，活学活用毛主席著作是第一好。我们学习解放军，首先就要学习他们对毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，对毛泽东思想的深厚的阶级感情，学习他们处处突出无产阶级政治，大抓狠抓活思想。解放军同志到机关以后，不是急于表态，而是深入细致地进行调查研究，最后对左派采取了坚决支持的行动。当时有些人对解放军的行动很不理解，甚至采取不友好的态度。这时候，解放军同志并不歧视他们，而是通过细致的思想工作争取他们。例如，一个时候，个别同志对解放军不支持自己有意见，解放军同志就按照毛主席教导的“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”，主动通过劳动、谈心等活动，逐步和群众接近。由于他们不断进行深入细致的思想工作，现在总局机关的广大群众认清了斗争的大方向。
    我们民航总局机关无产阶级革命派，在一年来的阶级斗争中，深深感到人民解放军是最可信赖的人，是我们学习的最好榜样。我们坚决听伟大领袖毛主席的话：相信和依靠人民解放军。我们决心永远永远和解放军紧紧团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
