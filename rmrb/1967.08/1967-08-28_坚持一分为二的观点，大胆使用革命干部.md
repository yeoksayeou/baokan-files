The article "Boldly Use Revolutionary Cadres" published in the newspaper has sparked a strong response at our Huadong New Normal University. Looking back at the two-month-long debate on cadre issues between the "revolutionary" and "conservative" factions at our school, and seeing the excellent situation at the Huadong New Normal University Revolutionary Committee with the integration of a group of revolutionary leading cadres represented by Comrade Yao Li, we deeply feel that correctly handling cadres, being good at identifying cadres, and boldly using cadres is indeed a major measure related to whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can seize and use power well.

Chairman Mao said: "The correct deployment of a commander comes from a correct decision, and a correct decision comes from a correct judgment." We proletarian revolutionaries must make a correct judgment about the situation of cadres in order to boldly use cadres. How can we make a correct judgment? This requires us to use the two-line struggle view to look at the cadre team and each cadre, as proposed in the article "Boldly Use Revolutionary Cadres." This is the key to correctly handling and identifying cadres.

The former first secretary of our school's party committee, Yao Li, executed the bourgeois reactionary line for a long time during the Cultural Revolution and the revisionist educational line in recent years. The mistakes are indeed serious. In the past, we only saw that he made serious mistakes, so for a long time, we insisted on overthrowing him. After the editorial of the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine was published, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy, insisted on using the two-line struggle view to handle and identify cadres, and insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against various non-proletarian thoughts in our ranks in an irreconcilable manner. We finally thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues in our school and the non-proletarian trend of "doubt everything, exclude everything, overthrow everything" in our ranks. We comprehensively and historically analyzed and studied the merits and demerits of Comrade Yao Li and concluded that Comrade Yao Li can be an object of integration for our school's temporary power organ.

Practical experience tells us that to view cadres with the two-line struggle, the most important thing is to view cadres with a developmental and changing perspective, rather than a static and isolated perspective. Viewing cadres with a developmental perspective means not only seeing the size of the mistakes made by cadres but also seeing whether they have recognized the mistakes made; not only seeing the side of cadres being harmed by mistakes but also seeing the side of them turning over a new leaf once they become aware. In the past, some comrades only saw the side of Yao Li making mistakes and did not see the side of him correcting and having corrected mistakes, thus one-sidedly grasping a point and exaggerating it to the extreme, incorrectly concluding that he must be overthrown. We believe that for a revolutionary leading cadre, making mistakes is indeed a bad thing, but as long as he truly accepts the lesson, strengthens his immunity, it is a good thing. Therefore, we should enthusiastically and actively help cadres recognize their mistakes, find the causes of the mistakes, point out the ways to correct them, and promote cadres to quickly turn back from the path of making mistakes, accept the lesson, and not make the same mistakes again, turning bad things into good things.

Using a developmental perspective to view problems means believing that through the tempering and testing of the Cultural Revolution, most cadres will not become worse but better, not weaker but stronger; cadres who make mistakes are not all unusable and should be kicked out, but after cleaning their skin, removing the dust, clarifying right and wrong, putting down their burdens, they will be stronger and more capable. The viewpoints such as "the educational front is rotten, good and relatively good cadres are in the minority"; "the first-in-command all executed the bourgeois reactionary line, all bear the main responsibility, and cannot be overthrown or integrated" are extremely wrong. In fact, before the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Yao Li rarely went deep into the masses, but from the "January Revolution" storm to the present, he has always lived and fought among the masses. Wherever there are comrades from the fighting teams who have opinions about him, he proactively and timely moves his bedding there, accepts the criticism and help from the revolutionary youngsters, showing his determination to correct his mistakes. Before the Cultural Revolution, his fighting spirit was not strong, and his emphasis on politics in work was not enough. However, now, in the face-to-face struggle with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party and our school, he can expose them mercilessly. For revolutionary work, he can also proactively take on responsibilities. Therefore, he has gained the understanding, trust, and support of the revolutionary youngsters.

Using a developmental perspective to view problems means seeing that the opposing sides of a contradiction are constantly changing and can transform into each other, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results. In a word, struggle is absolute, and unity is relative. We understand and grasp this, and we can correctly handle the contradictions and struggles within the cadre team. Cadres who have made mistakes in the past, due to learning from their lessons, can achieve new merits and make new contributions in new struggles; cadres who have not made mistakes, due to relaxing their self-requirements, may also make mistakes; cadres who have been integrated today, if they relax their worldview transformation in the future, may also become corrupt and degenerate; cadres who have not been integrated today, if they seriously reform, humbly learn, actively work, and make continuous progress, can also become outstanding cadres. As the article "Boldly Use Revolutionary Cadres" says: "We foresee this, and we can be prepared." The Huadong New Normal University revolutionary faction can boldly use and integrate revolutionary leading cadres precisely based on this understanding. This is completely in line with Chairman Mao's two-line struggle dialectical method.

    坚持一分为二的观点，大胆使用革命干部
    上海华东师范大学　红卫兵新师大师
    《要大胆使用革命干部》一文在报上发表后，在我们华东新师大引起了强烈的反应。回顾我校两个多月来在干部问题上“革”与“保”的一场大辩论，喜看我华东新师大革命委员会结合以姚力同志为代表的一批革命领导干部而出现的大好形势，我们深深体会到，正确对待干部，善于识别干部，大胆使用干部，确实是关系到无产阶级革命派掌好权用好权的一个重大措施。
    毛主席说：“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断”。我们无产阶级革命派，要大胆使用干部，必须对干部情况有正确的判断。怎样才能作出正确的判断呢？这就要象《要大胆使用革命干部》一文中提出的用一分为二的观点看待干部队伍和每个干部。这是正确对待干部，善于识别干部的关键所在。
    我校原党委第一书记姚力在文化大革命中，在很长一段时间内执行了资产阶级反动路线，在近几年的教育工作中执行了修正主义的教育路线。错误确实是严重的。过去，我们光看到他犯了严重错误的一面，因此在很长一段时间内坚持要把他打倒。《红旗》杂志第四期社论发表以后，我们认真地学习了毛主席的干部政策，坚持用一分为二的观点对待干部和识别干部，坚持用毛泽东思想与我们队伍中形形色色非无产阶级思想作不调和的斗争，终于较为彻底地批判了我校在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线和我们队伍中“怀疑一切，排斥一切，打倒一切”的非无产阶级思潮。我们全面地、历史地分析研究了姚力同志的功过，得出的结论是，姚力同志可以成为我校临时权力机构结合的对象。
    实践的经验告诉我们，要一分为二看干部，最重要的就是要用发展变化的观点看干部，而不是以孤立的静止的观点看干部。用发展的观点看干部，就是不仅看到干部所犯的错误的大小，更要看到他们对所犯的错误是否有所认识；不仅看到犯错误干部受毒害的一面，更要看到他们一旦觉悟反戈一击的一面。过去，有些同志只看到姚力犯错误的一面，而看不到他正在改正错误和已经改正错误的一面，因而片面地抓住一点，无限上纲，错误地得出非打倒不可的结论。我们认为，对于一个革命的领导干部来说，犯错误固然是坏事，但只要他真正地接受了教训，增强了免疫力，又是大好事。因此，我们应该满腔热忱地、积极地帮助干部认识错误，找出犯错误的原因，指出改正的途径，促使干部迅速地从犯错误的道路上回过头来，并接受教训，不再重犯，使坏事变好事。
    用发展的观点看问题，就是要坚信通过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，绝大部分干部不是更坏了，而是更好了，不是更软弱了，而是更坚强了；犯错误的干部不是都不能用，一脚踢开，而是清洁了肌肤，去掉了灰尘，弄清了是非，放下了包袱，更坚强更能干了。那种认为：“文教战线烂掉了，好的和比较好的干部是少数”；“第一把手都执行了资产阶级反动路线，都要负主要责任，打不倒也结合不了”等等观点，都是极端错误的。事实上，在文化大革命以前，姚力同志是很少深入群众的，可是从“一月革命”风暴至今，他一直生活、战斗在群众中间。哪个战斗队的同志对他有意见，他就主动地及时地把铺盖搬到哪里去，接受革命小将的批判和帮助，表现了改正自己错误的决心。文化大革命以前，他的斗争性不强，在工作中突出政治也是不够的。可是，现在在面对面地与上海市及我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行尖锐的斗争中，他能够毫不留情地进行揭发。对革命工作，他也能主动站出来挑担子。因此，他得到了革命小将的谅解、信任和支持。
    用发展的观点看问题，就是要看到矛盾对立的双方是不断变化的，是可以相互转化的，坏事情可以引出好的结果来，好的事情也会引出坏的结果来。一句话，斗争是绝对的，统一是相对的。我们了解了这一点，掌握了这一点，就可以正确处理干部队伍中的矛盾和斗争。过去犯过错误的干部，由于吸取了教训，在新的斗争中可以建新功、立新劳；没有犯过错误的干部，由于放松对自己的要求，也可能犯错误；今天结合了的干部，今后如果放松了世界观的改造，也可能在将来腐化堕落；今天没有结合的干部，如果认真改造，虚心学习，积极工作，不断前进，也可以成为优秀的干部。正如《要大胆使用革命干部》一文说的：“我们预见到这一点，就可以心中有数。”我们华东新师大革命派能够大胆使用和大胆结合革命领导干部，就是基于这种认识。这是完全符合毛主席的一分为二的革命辩证法的。
