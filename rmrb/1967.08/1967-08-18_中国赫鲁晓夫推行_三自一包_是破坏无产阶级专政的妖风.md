Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of "Three Self and One Contract" in the countryside a few years ago is a thoroughgoing capitalist commodity. The facts have proven that "Three Self and One Contract" not only destroys the collective economy but also weakens our lifeline—the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Our Lan Village Commune Six-Li Production Brigade is a unit that was severely harmed by the "Three Self and One Contract" poison. In 1961, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the county party personally came to our brigade to peddle "Three Self and One Contract," boasting about its "superiority" everywhere. They claimed that "contracting production to households can increase grain production" and that it is "a good way to develop production." At the time, we poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen knew upon hearing this that it was not a proper path and all opposed contracting production to households. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the party slandered us as "stubborn" and threatened, "If you don't contract production to households, if there are difficulties, we won't take care of you." As a result, they used their authority to force us, under various names such as private plots, vegetable plots, fodder plots, and labor plots, to contract most of the land to households. After contracting production to households, we poor and lower-middle peasants had no livestock, few tools, and were unable to cultivate. Coupled with natural disasters, grain production was severely reduced. Private plots were not well tended, and collective land was left fallow. In 1961, we relied heavily on state-supplied grain. In 1956, during the cooperative movement, our brigade could deliver over 330,000 jin of grain to the state each year, and each member had more grain than they could eat. After "Three Self and One Contract," agricultural production was severely disrupted, causing economic difficulties for the state, collective, and members.

The malicious wind of "Three Self and One Contract" not only caused severe damage to agricultural production but, more seriously, weakened the dictatorship of the proletariat, opening wide the door for a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements to carry out capitalist restoration. Before "Three Self and One Contract," we militiamen worked, studied, and trained together, strictly controlling landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who had not been reformed, allowing them only to behave properly and not to cause trouble. The social order was relatively good. After "Three Self and One Contract," a small clique of capitalist roaders within our brigade's party followed the tune of Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," claiming that "whether or not they are landlords, everyone eats by their abilities, and filling one's stomach is the most important." Because they did not emphasize class struggle and relaxed vigilance against the enemy, all the plow oxen in the entire brigade were contracted to be raised by landlords and rich peasants with strong labor power. In less than a year, more than 20 oxen died. Some landlord elements even used certificates issued by the brigade to engage in speculation and profiteering in free markets, oppressing and exploiting poor and lower-middle peasants. Under the protection of a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements also engaged in large-scale "reversal of verdicts," counterattacking and framing poor and lower-middle peasants, attempting to usurp proletarian political power. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "If we allow landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters to all come out, and our cadres do nothing about it, and many of them even do not distinguish between enemies and friends, collude with each other, are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, split and disintegrated, pulled out and infiltrated, and many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also softened and hardened by the enemy in this way, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at most, a few dozen years at most, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, we quickly saw through the enemy's plot and repelled the malicious wind of "Three Self and One Contract."

The "Three Self and One Contract" peddled by the biggest capitalist roader within the party is ultimately for whom? We poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen see it clearly. It is completely for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. He wants to use the "Three Self and One Contract" commodity to corrupt the souls of us poor and lower-middle peasants, disarm us ideologically, lay down our guns, and create conditions for implementing bourgeois dictatorship. It is truly more vicious than wolves and more poisonous than snakes. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, sweep away the poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen in the countryside, and make due contributions to defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”是破坏无产阶级专政的妖风
    山东省即墨县兰村公社六里大队贫农社员、民兵连长  管树林
    中国的赫鲁晓夫前几年在农村中推行的“三自一包”，是地地道道的资本主义黑货。事实证明：“三自一包”不仅破坏集体经济，而且削弱我们的命根子——无产阶级专政。
    我们兰村公社六里大队是受“三自一包”毒害比较严重的单位。一九六一年，我们县党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派亲自到俺大队推销“三自一包”，到处吹嘘“三自一包”的“优越性”。胡说什么：“包产到户能多打粮食”，“是发展生产的好办法”。当时，俺贫下中农和民兵一听就知道这不是个正经道，都不同意包产到户。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派竟诬蔑俺是“死心眼”，并威胁说：“你们不包产到户，有了困难，我们不管。”结果，他们利用职权，强迫我们以自留地、菜地、饲料地、劳力地等各种名目，把大部分土地包产到户。包产到户后，俺贫下中农一无牲畜，二少农具，无力耕种。加上自然灾害，粮食严重减产。自留地没种好，集体地也荒了。一九六一年吃了国家不少供应粮。一九五六年合作化时，俺大队一年就能向国家交售粮食三十三万多斤，每个社员分得的粮食吃不完。“三自一包”后，严重地破坏了农业生产，给国家、集体和社员造成了经济困难。
    “三自一包”的黑风不仅使农业生产遭到严重破坏，更严重的是削弱了无产阶级专政，为党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、地富反坏分子实行资本主义复辟大开方便之门。“三自一包”前，俺民兵一起劳动，一起学习，一起练武，对没有改造好的地富反坏分子管制得很严，只准他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，社会秩序较好。“三自一包”后，俺大队党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，学着中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的腔调，胡说什么：“管他地主不地主，都是凭本事吃饭，吃饱肚子要紧。”由于不讲阶级斗争，放松对敌人的警惕性，全大队的耕牛都包养到劳力强的地主、富农家里。不到一年，耕牛就死了二十多头。有些地主分子还拿着大队开的证明信到自由市场上去搞投机倒把活动，欺压和剥削贫下中农。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的庇护下，地、富、反、坏分子还大搞变天账，向贫下中农进行反攻倒算，妄图篡夺无产阶级政权。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”在毛主席的教导下，我们很快地识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，击退了“三自一包”的妖风。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派贩卖的“三自一包”，到底是为谁服务？俺们贫下中农和民兵看得一清二楚。他完全是为地、富、反、坏服务的。他妄想用“三自一包”的黑货来腐蚀俺贫下中农的灵魂，从思想上解除武装，放下枪杆子，为实行资产阶级专政创造条件，真是比狼还狠，比毒蛇还毒。我们决心遵照毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，和广大贫下中农一起，高举毛泽东思想的千钧棒，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，以痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙在农村中散布的流毒，为保卫无产阶级专政，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底作出应有的贡献！
