The first nationwide big-character poster and the commentary by the People's Daily editorial board are written so well! Comrades, please read this big-character poster and this commentary again. However, over the past fifty-plus days, some leading comrades from the central to the local levels have done the opposite. They have stood on the reactionary bourgeoisie's position, practiced bourgeois dictatorship, suppressed the vigorous cultural revolution movement of the proletariat, confused right and wrong, black and white, encircled the revolutionary factions, suppressed differing opinions, practiced white terror, and thought they were triumphant. They boosted the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and crushed the spirit of the proletariat. How poisonous it is! Linking this to the rightist deviation in 1962 and the "left" in form but rightist deviation in essence in 1964, isn't it something that can awaken people?

    毛主席语录
    全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读一遍这张大字报和这个评论。可是在五十多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形“左”而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？
