Vow to Stand with Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots to Fight Against British Imperialism to the End

Guang Feng, Peng Benyu, and General Secretary Cha He Duo Attend Meeting

The meeting solemnly declared: The British colonial authorities' so-called "sentencing" of our reporter Xue Ping and others is completely invalid! They must immediately stop the white terror and immediately release our patriotic news and film workers.

New China News Agency, August 4th: Over 15,000 proletarian revolutionary cadres from the capital's news and film circles and Red Guard youths solemnly declared: The British colonial authorities' so-called "sentencing" of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping and others is completely invalid! The British colonial authorities must stop the white terror and immediately release all detained Chinese patriotic news and film workers.

At the rally to denounce the British colonial authorities' fascist atrocities, attended by over 15,000 proletarian revolutionary cadres from the capital's news and film circles and Red Guard youths, the participants expressed their utmost indignation and strongly denounced and protested the British colonial authorities' continuous bloody suppression of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, their illegal arrest and "trial" of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters and other patriotic reporters and film workers. The meeting expressed that the proletarian revolutionary cadres from the capital's news and film circles and Red Guard youths are determined to stand with the patriotic compatriots, reporters, and film workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon to resolutely fight against all imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries to the end, to fight against the British colonial fascist authorities to the end, and to thoroughly bury British imperialism's reactionary and rotten colonial rule in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

Members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Guang Feng, Peng Benyu, and relevant leaders from the capital's news and film circles, Li Guangwen, Tang Pingzhu, Jin Jingmai, Chu Tunan, Yao Denshan, Zhang Zhi, Kang Shuji, Zeng Qin, and Xu Kai attended the meeting.

Also in attendance were General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association Cha He Duo, Secretary of the Secretariat Sugiyama Ichiro, Abu Qus, and revolutionary journalists from various countries in Beijing, as well as representatives from the Japanese Gearza Theater troupe visiting China.

The meeting was held at the grand Workers' Stadium, with a giant portrait of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao hanging in the center of the venue. The atmosphere was filled with a strong sense of unity and combat. The revolutionary warriors of the proletariat held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries!" They repeatedly sang, "With resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory."

At 3 PM, the meeting began with everyone standing and singing "The East Is Red," holding their beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

The meeting was presided over by Lu Bin, the first secretary of the All-China Journalists Association.

News circle representative Wang Weizhen spoke at the meeting. He said, British imperialism in Hong Kong brazenly persecutes the patriotic progressive forces in Hong Kong, especially daring to attack the news agency of the People's Republic of China stationed in Hong Kong, which is a new serious political provocation by British imperialism against the Chinese government and the 700 million Chinese people. This is another "upgrade" of the British colonial fascist atrocities. We, the news circle in the capital, strongly protest against British imperialism and the British authorities in Hong Kong!

Wang Weizhen said: Under the guidance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have launched a magnificent struggle against British imperialism, demonstrating the fearless spirit of the Chinese nation, safeguarding the dignity of the Chinese nation, defending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and showing the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

Wang Weizhen warmly praised the heroic struggle of the patriotic compatriots, reporters, and film workers in Hong Kong. He particularly pointed out: The reporters of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch and other patriotic newspaper reporters, in the enemy's "court," fearlessly and unyieldingly fought against the enemy, turning the enemy's "court" into a platform for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and exposing the crimes of British imperialism. They fearlessly exposed the enemy, tearing apart the fig leaf of the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of British imperialism, making the enemy embarrassed and helpless. They are indeed good warriors nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. The news circle in the capital hereby pays the highest tribute to the patriotic compatriots and progressive news circle comrades who are steadfastly fighting on the front lines of the struggle in Hong Kong!

Wang Weizhen pointed out that the atrocities of the British colonial authorities precisely exposed the weak essence of British imperialism's paper tiger, indicating that their days are not good. British imperialism, in cahoots with American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, brutally suppresses our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, arrests, and persecutes the reporters of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch and other patriotic newspaper reporters. This is because they fear the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. It is a great exposure of their desperate and hollow essence.

Wang Weizhen said, we solemnly warn the British colonial authorities: Your so-called "interrogation" and "sentencing" of Chinese news and film workers are completely illegal and invalid. You must stop the illegal "interrogation" of the reporters of the New China News Agency and other patriotic reporters and immediately release all detained Chinese patriotic news and film workers. The voice of justice cannot be stopped, and the heroic patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong cannot be suppressed. With the support of 700 million people in the motherland, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong will definitely fight to the end with the British colonial authorities; all comrades of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch will definitely fight to the end with the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and will not rest until victory is achieved.

The representative from the capital's film circle strongly condemned the British colonial authorities' bloody suppression of the patriotic compatriots, reporters, and film workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and warmly praised the heroic struggle of the patriotic film workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. She said, in the magnificent struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against British imperialism, the patriotic film workers and theater staff in Hong Kong and Kowloon also joined the struggle, exposing the fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities. Even the workers of the Shaw Brothers Film Production Company, controlled by American Kuomintang spies, broke free from the control of American Kuomintang spies and fought tenaciously against the British colonial fascist authorities and American Kuomintang spies.

She said, the brave workers, patriotic film workers, and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, in the struggle against British imperialism, showed great aspirations, daring to compete with the bully, not yielding an inch to the tyrant! They carried forward the revolutionary tradition of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle and demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation. The proletarian revolutionary cadres from the capital's film circle are determined to stand with the people of the whole country, vowing to be a strong backing for the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their struggle against British imperialism! We will pursue the enemy to the end, determined to fight British imperialism to the end and make them stink!

General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association Cha He Duo then spoke at the denunciation meeting. He strongly protested and condemned British imperialism's large-scale vicious attacks, massacres, arrests, and persecutions against Chinese workers, journalists, and others. He said, we stand completely on the side of Chinese workers, who bravely fight against cruel capitalist exploitation, savage suppression, and fascist atrocities. We unconditionally support our comrades and colleagues—the revolutionary journalists in Hong Kong, who, with the sole purpose of spreading the truth, bravely execute their reporting tasks despite the savage atrocities of British imperialism and its lackeys. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all illegally detained Chinese workers and journalists. We call on revolutionary journalists from Asia, Africa, and other regions of the world to thoroughly expose the fascist atrocities committed by British imperialists and their lackeys in Hong Kong.

Cha He Duo pointed out that the recent developments in Hong Kong are not an isolated incident. This is another manifestation of the imperialists led by the United States facing difficulties and heading towards comprehensive collapse.

Cha He Duo said, rebellion is justified. We are rebellious journalists. We are all revolutionary rebels, defenders of Mao Zedong Thought. Let us march forward bravely!

Representatives from the capital's Workers' Congress, higher education Red Guards, and middle school Red Guards also spoke at the meeting. They strongly protested and condemned the British colonial fascist authorities' mad suppression of the just struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They said, we cannot allow these bandits to run rampant. British imperialism's attempt to use butcher knives and batons to stop our patriotic news warriors from exposing their fascist atrocities and to use violence to extinguish the surging revolutionary struggle of our patriotic compatriots is nothing but a pipe dream, a foolish fantasy!

They said, the fascist atrocities of the British bandits cannot be covered up, the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon cannot be suppressed by any force, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be blocked by anyone. British imperialism's anti-China clamor is merely the whimpering of a few flies in the face of the great Chinese people and the Red Guards of China. The desperate struggles of the British bandits can only be like lifting a stone to drop on their own feet, greatly promoting the struggle of our patriotic compatriots against British imperialism and greatly accelerating their own doom.

They warmly praised the struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, saying, you did well! Against bandits, one must fight back with equal force, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, and fight inch by inch. The people of the motherland and the Red Guards firmly support you, vowing to stand together, fight together, and win together with you!

They solemnly warned the British colonial authorities: The blood debt you owe the Chinese people for over a hundred years must be settled! Hong Kong and Kowloon must return to the embrace of the motherland! The history of Hong Kong and Kowloon can only be written by the Chinese people, and the fate of Hong Kong and Kowloon is in the hands of the Chinese people. The day of the complete annihilation of British imperialism is not far off! Victory will definitely belong to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, victory will definitely belong to the Chinese people, and the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will forever fly high in Hong Kong and Kowloon!

The speeches at the meeting were frequently interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the revolutionary masses: "Firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots against British imperialism!" "Firmly support the struggle of the patriotic news and film circles in Hong Kong against British imperialism!" "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities!" "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The meeting passed a protest telegram to the British authorities in Hong Kong and a telegram of support to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

At the end of the meeting, the entire audience sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    关锋、戚本禹同志、查禾多总书记等出席大会
    大会郑重宣告：港英当局对我记者薛平等同志的非法“判决”完全无效！必须立即停止白色恐怖，必须立即释放我爱国新闻和电影工作者。
    新华社四日讯　首都新闻界、电影界无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将今天郑重宣告：港九英国当局对新华社香港分社记者薛平等同志的非法“判决”完全无效！港英当局必须停止白色恐怖，立即释放所有被捕的中国爱国新闻工作者和爱国电影工作者。
    在首都新闻界、电影界无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将一万五千多人参加的声讨港英当局法西斯暴行大会上，人们以无比愤怒的心情，最强烈地声讨和抗议港英当局连续血腥镇压我港九爱国同胞、非法逮捕并“审判”新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国记者、爱国电影工作者的法西斯暴行。大会表示，首都新闻界、电影界无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将决心同港九爱国同胞、爱国记者和爱国电影工作者一道，坚决同一切帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派斗争到底，同港英法西斯当局斗争到底，彻底埋葬英帝国主义在港九的反动腐朽的殖民统治。
    中央文革小组成员关锋、戚本禹和首都新闻界、电影界以及有关方面负责同志李广文、唐平铸、金敬迈、楚图南、姚登山、张志、康树集、曾蓁、徐铠出席了大会。
    出席大会的还有，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，书记处书记杉山市平、阿布库斯和在北京的各国革命的新闻工作者以及正在我国访问的日本齿轮座剧团的代表等。
    大会在雄伟的工人体育馆举行，会场中央高悬我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席巨幅画像。会场上充满强烈同仇敌忾的战斗气氛。无产阶级革命派的战士们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒一切反动派！”不断地高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    下午三时大会开始，全体起立高唱《东方红》，手捧心爱的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    大会由中华全国新闻工作者协会第一书记吕彬主持。
    新闻界代表王唯真在大会上讲话。他说，港英帝国主义猖狂地迫害香港爱国进步力量，特别是胆敢向中华人民共和国的国家通讯社派驻香港的机构，猖狂进攻，这是英帝国主义对中国政府和七亿中国人民新的严重的政治挑衅，是港英法西斯暴行的再一次“升级”。我们首都新闻界向英帝国主义和香港英国当局提出最强烈的抗议！
    王唯真说：香港爱国同胞在伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，在史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，展开了轰轰烈烈的反英抗暴斗争，表现了中华民族的大无畏精神，维护了中华民族的尊严，捍卫了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，显示了毛泽东思想的无比强大的威力。
    王唯真热烈赞扬了香港爱国同胞、爱国记者、爱国电影工作者的英勇斗争。他特别指出：新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国报纸记者在敌人的“法庭”上，不畏强暴，大义凛然，坚贞不屈，同敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，他们藐视英帝纸老虎，把敌人的“法庭”变成宣传毛泽东思想、审判港英帝国主义罪行的讲坛。他们在敌人“法庭”上无情地揭露敌人，把英帝国主义的所谓“民主”“自由”的遮羞布撕得粉碎，使敌人当场出丑，狼狈不堪。他们不愧为毛泽东思想哺育出来的好战士，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女。首都新闻界在这里，谨向坚持在斗争最前线的香港爱国同胞和香港进步的新闻界同志致以最崇高的敬礼！
    王唯真指出，港英当局的暴行，恰恰暴露了英帝国主义纸老虎的虚弱本质，说明他们的日子很不好过。英帝国主义同美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义狼狈为奸，在香港对我爱国同胞的残暴镇压，对新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国报纸记者的逮捕和迫害，是因为他们害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是他们走投无路、外强中干的虚弱本质的大暴露。
    王唯真说，我们严重警告港英当局：你们对中国新闻工作者和电影工作者的无理“审讯”和“判决”，是完全非法的、完全无效的。你们必须停止对新华社记者以及其他爱国记者的非法“审讯”，并且立即释放所有被捕的中国爱国新闻工作者和爱国电影工作者。正义的声音是阻挡不住的，英雄的香港爱国同胞是压不倒的。香港爱国同胞在祖国七亿人民的支援下，一定要同港英当局坚决斗争到底；新华社香港分社的全体同志，一定同香港爱国同胞一起，坚决斗争到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    首都电影界代表在讲话中强烈谴责港英当局血腥镇压港九爱国同胞、爱国记者和爱国电影工作者的法西斯暴行，热烈赞扬港九爱国电影工作者的英勇斗争。她说，在声势浩大的香港同胞反英抗暴斗争中，港九的爱国电影工作者和戏院职工，也参加了斗争的行列，揭露港英当局的法西斯暴行，连被美蒋特务控制的邵氏电影制片厂的爱国职工，也纷纷摆脱美蒋特务的控制，同港英法西斯当局和美蒋特务进行了顽强的斗争。
    她说，英勇的香港工人、爱国电影工作者和爱国同胞们，在反英抗暴斗争中，壮志凌云，“敢同恶霸争高下”，“不向霸王让寸分”！发扬了中国人民反帝斗争的革命传统，表现了中华民族的英雄气节。首都电影界无产阶级革命派，决心和全国人民一起，誓作港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的强大后盾！抗顽敌，追穷寇，誓把英帝国主义斗倒、斗臭！
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多接着在声讨大会上讲话。他强烈抗议和谴责港英帝国主义对中国工人、新闻工作者和其他人所采取的大规模的恶毒攻击、屠杀、逮捕和迫害。他说，我们完全站在中国工人一边，他们英勇地同残酷的资本主义剥削、野蛮的镇压和法西斯暴行进行斗争。我们无条件地支持我们的同志和同事——香港的中国革命新闻工作者，他们在抱着传播真理的唯一目的执行报道任务时，英勇地无视英帝国主义及其仆从的野蛮暴行。我们要求立即和无条件释放所有被非法逮捕的中国工人和新闻工作者。我们呼吁亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区所有革命的新闻工作者彻底揭露英帝国主义者及其在香港的仆从犯下的法西斯暴行。
    查禾多指出，香港事态的最近发展，决不是一个独立的事件。这是以美国为首的帝国主义正面临困境，正走向全面崩溃的又一表现。
    查禾多说，造反有理。我们是造反的新闻工作者。我们都是革命造反派，是毛泽东思想的维护者。让我们勇往直前吧！
    首都工代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会的代表也在大会上讲话，他们最最强烈地抗议和谴责港英法西斯当局对我港九爱国同胞的正义斗争进行疯狂的镇压。他们说，我们决不能允许这些强盗这样横行霸道，英帝国主义妄想用屠刀和警棍来阻拦我爱国新闻战士揭露他们的法西斯暴行，妄想用暴力扑灭我爱国同胞汹涌澎湃的革命斗争，完全是白日作梦，痴心妄想！
    他们说，英国强盗的法西斯暴行是掩盖不了的，港九爱国同胞的正义斗争是任何力量也压不服的，毛泽东思想的光辉是任何人也封锁不住的。英帝国主义的反华叫嚣在伟大的中国人民面前，在中国红卫兵小将面前，只不过是几只苍蝇的抽泣。英国强盗的垂死挣扎只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，大大促进我爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，大大加速它自己的灭亡。
    他们热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞的斗争，他们说，你们干得好！对待强盗就是要以牙还牙，以眼还眼，针锋相对，寸土必争。祖国人民和红卫兵小将坚决支持你们，誓与你们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    他们严重警告港英当局：你们一百多年来欠下中国人民的血债，必须彻底清算！港九一定要回到祖国的怀抱！港九的历史，只能由中国人民来写，港九的命运掌握在中国人民的手中，英帝国主义彻底灭亡的日子已经不远了！胜利必定属于港九爱国同胞，胜利必定属于中国人民，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗必将在港九永远胜利地飘扬！
    大会上的讲话，不时被全场激昂的口号声打断，革命群众高呼：“坚决支持香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争！”“坚决支持香港爱国新闻界、电影界的反英抗暴斗争！”“强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行！ ”“血债要用血来还！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    大会通过了给香港英国当局的抗议电和给港九爱国同胞的声援电。
    大会结束时，全场高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
