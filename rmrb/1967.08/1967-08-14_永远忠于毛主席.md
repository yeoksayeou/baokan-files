Under the close care of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and with the strong support of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the PLA soldiers and officers nationwide, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area, after fierce struggles, have smashed the ferocious counterattacks by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military, and a handful of bad heads within the "Million Heroes" and the public security, procuratorate, and court system who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This has fundamentally reversed the situation in Wuhan and turned a great evil into a great good. Through this great struggle, the great tide of the July Revolution has emerged, and through severe tests, every Party member, cadre, mass organization, and social political force has been examined. The class lines are very clear. This has created very favorable conditions for thoroughly solving the problems in the Wuhan area, bringing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan to a new stage.

This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area, who have been deeply persecuted and have now been completely liberated, express our deepest gratitude to our great leader Chairman Mao. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

We deeply understand: The victories we have already achieved are only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li; more arduous tasks lie ahead. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country. With a red heart, we vow to defend Chairman Mao and forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and their agents in the Wuhan area.

We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, raise high the banner of great unity, strengthen the unity within the revolutionary ranks, be strict with ourselves and lenient with others, make more self-criticisms, humbly learn from brother organizations, and see more of others' strong points; study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, consider the overall situation and have a broad vision, and always put the overall interests of the proletariat first.

We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, raise high the banner of supporting the army, strive to be models in supporting the army, firmly unite with the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Wuhan troops, fight together, and win together; firmly trust and strongly support Commander Zhang Siyi and Political Commissar Liu Feng, who were appointed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, seize the revolution and promote production. For those who are still not awakened or have ulterior motives and want to slack off, we will firmly stand up to them, and together with the PLA and worker comrades, maintain the order of the revolution and production; go to the suburbs to help with the harvest and learn from the fine qualities of poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings: The enemy will not perish by itself, and the reactionaries will not be overthrown without a fight. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must be a thousand times more vigilant, meet the enemy head-on, and make them perish if they do not surrender!

Now, a major problem is before us: How to seize the power of the "self" in our minds, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, and make a thorough revolution. We must take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, read them every day, and apply them every day. "Wholeheartedly serve the people, never leave the masses; everything starts from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups; the consistency of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the Party's leading organs; these are our starting points." Chairman Mao's teachings are so warm and close to us! We must always act according to Chairman Mao's teachings!

We must stand high and look far. The problems in Wuhan are of great significance, not just a problem for a few organizations in one place, but directly related to the interests of the whole country and the interests of the world proletarian revolution. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, should think of the whole revolutionary cause and always put the interests of the revolution first.

Chairman Mao is backing us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area. We must make Chairman Mao proud!

    永远忠于毛主席
    武汉地区钢工总、钢二司、钢九一三、新华工、新湖大、新华农、三司革联等革命组织负责人  朱鸿霞　夏邦银　丁家显　方宝林　李想玉　但功荣　张立国郭宝安　谢邦柱　彭　勋　高玉泽　魏梅森　雪湘明　曾庆元
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席、党中央、中央文革小组的亲切关怀下，在全国无产阶级革命派和人民解放军三军指战员的大力支持下，武汉地区无产阶级革命派经过激烈的搏斗，粉碎了武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”、公检法中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头的猖狂反扑，从根本上扭转了武汉的局势，把大坏事变成了大好事。通过这场大搏斗，出现了伟大的七月革命怒涛，通过严峻的考验，检查了每一个党员、干部，每一个群众组织，每一种社会政治力量。阶级阵线非常分明。这为彻底解决武汉地区问题创造了非常有利的条件，使武汉的无产阶级文化大革命进到了一个崭新的阶段。
    这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们深受迫害而又得到彻底翻身的武汉地区无产阶级革命派，千恩万谢我们伟大的领袖毛主席，我们千遍万遍地高呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    我们深深懂得：已经取得的胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步，更艰巨的任务正摆在我们面前。我们绝不辜负毛主席和全国人民对我们的期望，一颗红心誓死保卫毛主席，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，高举革命的批判大旗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头始终对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人。
    我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，高举革命的大联合的大旗，加强革命派内部的团结，严以责己，宽以待人，多作自我批评，虚心向兄弟组织学习，多看别人的长处；活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，顾大局、识大体，处处以无产阶级的整体利益为重。
    我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，高举拥军的大旗，争当拥军的模范，坚决和武汉部队广大指战员团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起；对于毛主席、林副主席委派的武汉部队曾思玉司令员和刘丰政治委员，坚决信任，大力支持。
    我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，抓革命，促生产。一些到现在还不觉悟的或别有用心的人要怠工，我们坚决顶上去，和解放军、工人同志一起，去维护革命的秩序和生产的秩序；到郊区去帮助收割，学习贫下中农的优良品质。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，敌人是不会自行消灭的，反动派是不打不倒的，我们无产阶级革命派要千百倍地提高警惕，针锋相对，敌人不投降，就叫他灭亡！
    现在一个最大的问题摆在我们面前：这就是如何夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，破私立公，彻底革命。我们必须把“老三篇”作为座右铭，天天读，天天用。“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”毛主席的这些教导，是多么的亲切啊！我们一定要永远遵照毛主席的教导办事！
    我们要站得高，看得远。武汉的问题关系重大，不是我们一个地方几个组织的问题，而是直接关系到整个国家的利益，关系到全世界无产阶级革命的利益。我们无产阶级革命派，应当想到整个革命事业，一切以革命利益为重。
    毛主席为我们武汉地区无产阶级革命派撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！
