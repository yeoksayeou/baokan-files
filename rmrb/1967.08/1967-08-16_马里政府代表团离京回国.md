A delegation from the Malian government, led by Sedou Badian Kouyate, concluded its friendly visit to China and departed from Beijing by plane this afternoon to return home. During their stay in Beijing, the Malian friends visited people's communes, schools, and a unit of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing. Kouyate, the delegation leader, enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao as the red sun in the hearts of the world's people. He expressed that the Malian people firmly stand with the Chinese people and condemn the imperialists' slander against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. When the Malian guests left Beijing, revolutionary masses from the capital and relevant officials such as Fang Yi and Han Nianlong went to the airport to see them off. As the Malian guests bid farewell to the welcoming crowd, people held up portraits of Chairman Mao, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted slogans: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mali!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The Malian guests also waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and warmly greeted the welcoming crowd.

The Malian Ambassador to China, Gisse, and ambassadors from other African countries in China also went to the airport to see them off.
