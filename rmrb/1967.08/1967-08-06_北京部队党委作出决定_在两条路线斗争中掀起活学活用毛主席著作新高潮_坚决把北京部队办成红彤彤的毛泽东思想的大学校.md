The Beijing Military Region Party Committee, in order to enthusiastically respond to and resolutely implement the decision of the Central Military Commission, based on the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, to convene the national military conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works in early spring, has launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The decision aims to turn the Beijing Military Region into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. On July 8, the committee issued the "Decision on Promoting the Mass Movement to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works to a New Stage in the Struggle Between the Two Lines." The full text of the decision is as follows:

Since Vice Chairman Lin called for raising the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to a new level, the Beijing Military Region has seen a new situation in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers, with deep affection for Chairman Mao, have used Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in the struggle between the two lines and in carrying out tasks such as "Three Supports, Two Militaries." They have achieved new levels in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, transforming their worldviews, and learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have created new experiences, emerged new models, and achieved new heights. Now, the world has entered a new era of Mao Zedong Thought, and our country is at a critical moment in the great victory of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Our army is shouldering the glorious tasks of "Three Supports, Two Militaries," defending the nation, and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The new era, new situation, and new tasks have placed higher demands on us. Recently, Vice Chairman Lin instructed and the Central Military Commission decided to convene the national military conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works in early spring. This is a highly significant event in the history of our army. It will also have a major impact on the national mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought around the world. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, welcome the convening of the national military conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works, further implement Vice Chairman Lin's series of instructions, and in the struggle between the two lines, promote the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and truly turn the Beijing Military Region into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

(1)

In accordance with Vice Chairman Lin's instruction that "the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue," we must persistently and thoroughly address the issue of our attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a great demand of the times and the most fundamental requirement for promoting the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao has systematically solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice, reaching the highest peak in the history of Marxism's development. We must closely combine the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, use various forms and all activities to frequently, extensively, and deeply propagate that Marxism-Leninism has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, that the world has entered a new era of Mao Zedong Thought, and that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has great significance for the ideological transformation of the troops and for the Chinese and world revolutions. We must further deepen our class feelings of unlimited love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and make all our words and deeds conform to the highest standard of Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought must be resolutely implemented; whatever contradicts Mao Zedong Thought must be resolutely fought against. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we must implement those we understand and also implement those we do not yet understand. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we must strike. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Deepening the education on the struggle between the two lines, tempering and testing the troops in the great waves of class struggle, and strengthening the construction of the troops to be more proletarian and more combat-ready are the central tasks for promoting the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to a new stage in the troops.

Education on the struggle between the two lines is the most profound and vivid education in Mao Zedong Thought. We must adhere to Chairman Mao's teaching that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power," and always focus on the fundamental issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. We must seriously study, understand, and master Chairman Mao's great theory on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. We must clarify the main objects and main contradictions of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the key issue of the betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow him, and thoroughly eliminate the poison he has spread in various aspects. We must thoroughly criticize and repudiate revisionist thoughts and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

The "Three Supports, Two Militaries" have opened up a broad horizon for the troops to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. All levels of leadership must seize this excellent opportunity to temper and build the troops in the great waves of class struggle. The personnel of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" must, in the fiery class struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of different social contradictions, resolutely support the revolutionary leftists, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly treating the masses, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' initiative, be willing to be the masses' students, study and apply Chairman Mao's strategic thoughts, resolutely implement the Party's policies, conduct in-depth investigations, and continuously summarize the experiences of struggle and improve the level of struggle. We must, while transforming the objective world, continuously transform the subjective world. We must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "self," "fear," and "difficulty" characters, be firm in our stand, dare to uphold the truth, courageously correct errors, be modest and prudent, and not be arrogant or impatient. We must completely, thoroughly, and wholeheartedly serve the people and resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

(3)

The great struggle between the two lines reflects in people's minds as a great struggle between two worldviews and between public and private interests. We must consciously, in the struggle between the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "self" character and firmly establish the "public" character, transform our worldviews. This is the fundamental path to eliminating bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology and to achieving ideological transformation.

To criticize and repudiate the "self" character and transform our worldviews, we must first grasp the major issues and place the resolution of political direction and line issues in the first position. We must thoroughly free ourselves from the small world of personal gains and losses and truly care about national affairs, class struggles, and world revolutionary affairs. We must be good at using the method of class analysis to see the intrinsic connection between these major issues and our lives, work, speech, and actions, grasp the active thoughts in the struggle between the two lines, and prominently solve the issues of understanding and attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the revolutionary mass movement. We must truly remember class struggle, remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, remember to emphasize politics, and remember to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory. We must extensively study and apply the "Three Articles" and "On Correcting Wrong Ideas in the Party," deeply touch the soul, criticize and repudiate the "self" character in the mind, and establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public. We must resist and overcome various forms of individualism, anarchism, ultra-democracy, and other non-proletarian thoughts, and greatly strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the troops, ensuring that the troops can withstand the severe test of class struggle in various situations.

(4)

We must further strengthen the leadership of various levels of Party committees over the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The deeper the class struggle, the more arduous the tasks of the troops, the more we must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first position, and the more we must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, transform everything, and promote everything. This is the fundamental key to whether we can adapt to the new situation, complete the new tasks, and make new contributions.

All levels of cadres must "go to the masses and stay with the masses," undergo the test of the great waves of class struggle, and in the struggle between the two lines, take the lead in learning and applying new levels, and become examples of transforming worldviews.

All levels of Party committees and political organs must further strengthen the leadership over the study and application of Chairman Mao's works by the personnel of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries." The training of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel should adopt more "experience-sharing meetings" to exchange experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries."

We must vigorously cultivate new models of units and individuals who study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two lines, and summarize new experiences. We must place the active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works on the front line of class struggle for testing and tempering. We must regularly convene conferences of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works, with military and division-level units convening once a year to form a system. All levels must actively prepare for the convening of the conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Military Region and the entire army, and quickly launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    北京部队党委作出决定
    在两条路线斗争中掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮  坚决把北京部队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校
    新华社二日讯　中共北京部队委员会为了热烈响应和坚决贯彻中央军委根据林副主席指示作出的关于明春召开全军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的决定，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮，把北京部队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，于七月八日作出了《关于在两条路线斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的决定》。决定全文如下：
    从林副主席号召把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段以来，北京部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个新局面。广大指战员怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，在两条路线斗争中，在执行“三支”“两军”等项任务中，用毛泽东思想作统帅，在大节上破私立公，改造世界观，学出用出了新水平，创造出了新经验，涌现出了新典型。现在，世界已进入毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，我国正处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争取得伟大胜利的关键时刻，我军正肩负着“三支”“两军”和保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务。新的时代、新的形势、新的任务对我们提出了更高的要求。最近，林副主席指示并经中央军委决定明春召开全军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，这是我军建军史上一件极为重要的大事；同时，对全国活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，对毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，也将发生重大影响。我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎接全军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的召开，进一步落实林副主席的一系列指示，在两条路线斗争中，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，把北京部队真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    （一）
    遵照林副主席关于“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题”的指示，持续不断地狠抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的态度问题，这是时代的伟大要求，是把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段最根本的根本。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛主席从理论上和实践上系统地解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命的问题，攀登了马克思主义发展史上最新的高峰。我们必须紧密结合无产阶级文化大革命的实践，采用各种形式，通过一切活动，经常地、广泛地、深入地宣传马克思列宁主义发展到了毛泽东思想新阶段，宣传世界进入了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，宣传活学活用毛主席著作对部队思想革命化的伟大意义，对中国革命和世界革命的伟大意义，进一步加深对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，使我们的一切言论行动都以毛泽东思想为最高标准。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决照办；凡是违背毛泽东思想的，就坚决斗争。对毛主席的指示，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行。毛主席指到那里，就打到那里。永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    （二）
    深入进行两条路线斗争的教育，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里锻炼考验部队，加强部队更加无产阶级化更加战斗化的建设，这是把部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的中心课题。
    两条路线斗争的教育是最深刻最生动的毛泽东思想的教育。一定要遵照毛主席关于“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的教导，始终围绕巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟这个根本问题，把教育搞深搞透。认真学习、领会和掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的伟大理论。弄清无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象和主要矛盾。高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，抓住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政这个要害问题，把他批深、批透、批倒、批臭，狠批《修养》，彻底肃清他在各方面散播的流毒。大破修正主义思想，大立毛泽东思想。
      “三支”“两军”为部队活学活用毛主席著作开辟了广阔的天地。各级领导要抓紧这个大好时机，在阶级斗争的大风浪中锻炼部队，建设部队。“三支”“两军”人员必须在火热的阶级斗争中，活学活用毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的社会矛盾，坚决支持革命左派，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，活学活用毛主席关于正确对待群众的教导，坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，甘当群众的小学生，活学活用毛主席的策略思想，坚决贯彻党的政策，深入调查研究，不断总结斗争经验，提高斗争水平。必须在改造客观世界的同时，不断地改造主观世界。大破“私”字、“怕”字、“难”字，做到立场坚定，“敢”字当头，对工作对自己都要一分为二，敢于坚持真理，勇于修正错误，谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，完全彻底为人民服务，坚决执行和誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    （三）
    两条路线斗争的大决战，反映在人们头脑里就是两种世界观的大搏斗，就是公和私的大搏斗。要自觉地在两条路线斗争中，用毛泽东思想大破“私”字，大立“公”字，改造世界观，这是灭资兴无，搞好思想革命化的根本途径。
    破私立公，改造世界观，首先要抓大节，把解决政治方向问题、路线问题放在第一位。彻底从个人得失的小天地里解放出来，真正关心国家大事、阶级斗争的大事、世界革命的大事。善于用阶级分析的方法，看清这些大事与自己的生活、工作、言论、行动的内在联系，狠抓两条路线斗争中的活思想，突出地解决对毛主席革命路线和对革命群众运动的认识问题和态度问题，真正做到念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。要大学大用“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，狠触灵魂，在头脑里造“私”字的反，树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观。抵制和克服形形色色的个人主义，无政府主义，极端民主化等非无产阶级思想，大力加强部队的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，保证部队在各种情况下能经受住阶级斗争的严峻考验。
    （四）
    进一步加强各级党委对活学活用毛主席著作的领导。阶级斗争越深入，部队任务越艰巨，就越要把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，越要用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切、改造一切、带动一切。这是能不能适应新形势、完成新任务、做出新贡献的根本关键。
    各级干部一定要“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”，经受阶级斗争大风大浪的考验，在两条路线斗争中，带头学出新水平，用出新水平，成为改造世界观的榜样。
    各级党委和政治机关要进一步加强对“三支”“两军”人员活学活用毛主席著作的领导。“三支”“两军”人员的整训，要多采用“讲用会”的形式，交流“三支”“两军”中活学活用毛主席著作的经验。
    大力培养在两条路线斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的单位和个人新典型，总结新经验。把学习毛主席著作积极分子放到阶级斗争第一线去经受考验和锻炼。定期召开学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，军、师一级单位每年召开一次，形成制度。各级要积极为北京部队和全军召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会做好准备，迅速掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
