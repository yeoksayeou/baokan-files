The Chinese Embassy in Burma and patriotic overseas Chinese, filled with indignation, held a funeral for martyr Liu Yingchao. The Ne Win government owes a blood debt that must be repaid.

New China News Agency, August 27th: Rangoon news: On the afternoon of the 26th, a funeral was held for Liu Yingchao, the leader of the patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma and the chairman of the Burma Overseas Chinese Workers' Union, at a Chinese cemetery near Rangoon. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, Xiao Ming, embassy staff, Chinese experts in Rangoon, and approximately 1,600 representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese attended the funeral with heavy hearts.

Martyr Liu Yingchao was arrested illegally on June 26th after the Ne Win reactionary government instigated an anti-China and anti-Chinese wave. He was going to visit patriotic overseas Chinese students who were bravely fighting against the Ne Win government's unreasonable ban on wearing Chairman Mao's badges. Ignoring the repeated stern warnings from the Chinese Embassy in Burma not to harm Liu Yingchao and other overseas Chinese, the Ne Win reactionary government illegally imprisoned Liu Yingchao for two months, subjected him to savage beatings multiple times, and ultimately murdered him in prison.

The funeral was held in a very solemn atmosphere. In the hall where the funeral was held, Liu Yingchao's ashes and portrait were displayed. The attendees paid their respects in silence. They read aloud Chairman Mao's quotes: "To struggle is to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. We die for the people, and that is a worthy death." "With determination, fearlessness of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

Acting Charge d'affaires Xiao Ming, on behalf of the Chinese Embassy, the Chinese government, and the 700 million Chinese people and overseas Chinese, strongly protested the fascist atrocity of the Ne Win reactionary government in killing Liu Yingchao. He demanded that the Ne Win reactionary government repay its blood debt. Xiao Ming said that Liu Yingchao, in the struggle against the reactionary government of Burma's frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, showed great heroism. Like the martyrs of the Burma Overseas Chinese Teachers' Union, the Yi Jiang Chorus, and the Overseas Chinese Employees' Union, he sacrificed himself to defend Mao Zedong Thought and uphold the dignity of the motherland. Their sacrifice is glorious. Their resolute opposition to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries will forever live in the hearts of millions of people.

Xiao Ming said: "The blood of Liu Yingchao will not be shed in vain. The blood of the children of the Chinese nation will not be shed in vain. We will never forget that many patriotic overseas Chinese are still imprisoned by the reactionary government of Burma and are being subjected to various forms of persecution. We must wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary government of Burma. The more the reactionary government of Burma is rampant in its anti-China actions, the sooner its end will come." He concluded with the slogans: "Down with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries! Down with the reactionary government of Burma! Long live the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Subsequently, the relatives of martyr Liu Yingchao, amidst the majestic singing of the song "Quotes from Chairman Mao," buried the martyr's ashes in the cemetery.

On the 25th, more than a thousand representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese in Rangoon held a grand memorial ceremony for martyr Liu Yingchao. Acting Charge d'affaires Xiao Ming, embassy staff, and other Chinese personnel in Burma, as well as Chinese experts in Rangoon, all attended the memorial ceremony.

    我驻缅使馆和爱国华侨满怀激愤为刘应超烈士举行葬礼
    奈温政府欠下血债必须偿还
    新华社二十七日讯  仰光消息：缅甸爱国华侨领袖、缅甸华侨工人联合会主席刘应超烈士的葬礼二十六日下午在仰光附近的一座中国公墓举行。中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明、中国大使馆人员、在仰光的中国专家以及大约一千六百名爱国华侨代表，怀着悲愤的心情参加了葬礼。
    刘应超烈士是在奈温反动政府一手掀起反华排华逆流以后，在六月二十六日前往原华侨中学看望为反对奈温政府无理禁止佩戴毛主席像章而进行英勇斗争的爱国华侨学生时，被非法逮捕的。奈温反动政府不顾中国驻缅甸大使馆多次提出的不得迫害刘应超和其他华侨的严正警告，把刘应超非法监禁达两个月，多次野蛮地进行拷打，最后把刘应超烈士害死在狱中。
    葬礼是在十分庄严的气氛中举行的。在举行葬礼的大厅里陈放着刘应超烈士的骨灰和遗像。参加葬礼的人们向烈士默哀致敬。他们齐声朗读毛主席语录：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。……我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    中国大使馆临时代办肖明在讲话中，代表中国大使馆、中国政府和七亿中国人民和海外华侨，最强烈地抗议奈温反动政府杀害刘应超烈士的法西斯暴行，要求奈温反动政府偿还血债。肖明说，刘应超烈士在反对缅甸反动政府疯狂反华排华的逆流的斗争中，表现了大无畏的英雄气概。他象缅甸华侨教师联合会、伊江合唱团和华侨职员工会的烈士们一样，是为了保卫毛泽东思想和维护祖国的尊严而牺牲的。他们的牺牲是无尚光荣的。他们坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的英勇精神，将永远活在亿万人民的心中。
    肖明说：“刘应超同志的血是不会白流的。中华民族儿女的血是不会白流的。我们决不会忘记，许多爱国华侨仍然被缅甸反动政府关在监狱里，受到各种迫害。我们必须同缅甸反动政府进行坚决的斗争。缅甸反动政府越是猖狂反华，它的末日将到来得越快。”他最后高呼：“帝国主义、修正主义和反动派必败！缅甸反动派必败！中缅两国人民的传统友谊万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    随后，刘应超烈士的亲属在全场齐唱毛主席语录歌的雄伟的歌声中，把烈士的骨灰安葬在公墓。
    二十五日，仰光的爱国华侨代表一千多人为刘应超烈士举行了盛大的公祭仪式。中国大使馆临时代办肖明、大使馆和中国其他驻缅机构人员、在仰光的中国专家都出席了公祭仪式。
