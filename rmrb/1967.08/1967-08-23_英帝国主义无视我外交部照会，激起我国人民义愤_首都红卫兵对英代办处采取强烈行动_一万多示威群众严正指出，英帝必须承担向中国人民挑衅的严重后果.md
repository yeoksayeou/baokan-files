The fascist atrocities perpetrated by British imperialism against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have infuriated the Red Guards and revolutionary masses of the capital. Over ten thousand people gathered tonight at the British Charge d'Affaires' office to hold a massive protest. They held a rally to denounce British imperialism's anti-China crimes in front of the building and took strong actions against the British Charge d'Affaires' office out of righteous indignation.

The rally sternly pointed out: The British government dared to ignore the demands of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note on August 20th, which required the withdrawal of the ban on three patriotic newspapers in Hong Kong within 48 hours, the release of detained patriotic journalists, and the withdrawal of illegal lawsuits against patriotic newspapers and printing companies. This is a serious political provocation against the Chinese people. The rally stated: The Chinese people are people of their word. The Chinese people will not allow British imperialists to run rampant in Hong Kong. The British government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

Tonight, the angry slogans in front of the British Charge d'Affaires' office shook the heavens and the earth. The Red Guards and revolutionary masses, united in their hatred of the enemy, continuously shouted, "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Those who oppose China will meet a bad end!" "The British in Hong Kong will surely fail!" "The Chinese people will surely win!" "Firmly support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong in their anti-British and anti-fascist struggle!" "The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong must bow their heads and apologize!"

In their speeches, the Red Guards and representatives of revolutionary workers firmly stated: We will resolutely fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries with unyielding determination until we achieve complete victory. The speakers emphasized that the era when the Chinese people could be bullied by imperialism has long passed. This paper tiger of British imperialism is not in the eyes of the Chinese people. The heinous crimes and blood debts owed by the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong to the Chinese people and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong must be thoroughly settled!

"The sacred right of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong to propagate Mao Zedong Thought must not be infringed upon!" This was the strongest voice at the rally. Speakers one after another pointed out that since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been more widely spread throughout the world. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. The British fascist authorities use various despicable and shameful means to persecute patriotic news agencies and journalists in Hong Kong, attempting to block the voice of truth, to hinder the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to extinguish the flames of anti-British and anti-fascist struggle among patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. This is sheer delusion. The Red Guards and seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be intimidated or crushed. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high over Hong Kong.

The revolutionary masses of the capital also expressed their high respect to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong who are persevering in their anti-British and anti-fascist struggle. They enthusiastically praised the fighting spirit of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, who have shown the fearless courage of the Chinese people. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are heroic sons and daughters nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They pointed out that Hong Kong is Chinese territory, and the heroic struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong shows that the fate of Hong Kong will be determined by the Chinese people. With seven hundred million compatriots in the motherland as their backing, the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong will surely achieve final victory.

    英帝国主义无视我外交部照会，激起我国人民义愤
    首都红卫兵对英代办处采取强烈行动
    一万多示威群众严正指出，英帝必须承担向中国人民挑衅的严重后果
    新华社二十二日讯  被英帝国主义疯狂迫害我香港爱国同胞的法西斯暴行激怒了的首都红卫兵和革命群众一万多人，今晚涌到英国驻华代办处举行声势浩大的示威，在门前举行了声讨英帝反华罪行大会，并且激于义愤，对英国驻华代办处采取了强烈的行动。
    声讨大会严正指出：英国政府竟敢无视我国外交部八月二十日照会的要求，在四十八小时内尚未撤销对香港三家爱国报纸的停刊令，拒不释放被捕的爱国新闻工作者和撤销对爱国报纸以及印刷公司的非法诉讼，这是对中国人民的严重政治挑衅。大会指出：中国人民是说话算数的。中国人民决不允许英帝国主义者在香港横行霸道。英国政府必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
    今晚，英国驻华代办处门前愤怒的口号声震天动地。同仇敌忾的红卫兵小将和革命群众不断高呼：“打倒英帝！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“反华的人决没有好下场！”“港英必败！”“中国人民必胜！”“坚决支持香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争！”“港英法西斯当局必须低头认罪！”
    在会上发言的红卫兵小将和革命职工代表坚定地表示：我们对于帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，就是要针锋相对地进行坚决的斗争，不获全胜，决不罢休。发言的人强调指出，中国人民任凭帝国主义欺侮的时代早已一去不复返了。英帝国主义这只千疮百孔的纸老虎，不在中国人民的眼里。港英法西斯当局对中国人民和香港爱国同胞犯下的滔天罪行、欠下的累累血债，必须得到彻底的清算！
      “香港爱国同胞宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利不容侵犯！”这是声讨大会上最强烈的声音。在大会上发言的人一个接一个地指出，从史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命以来，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界得到了更广泛的传播，毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，照亮了全世界革命人民的心。港英法西斯当局用各种卑鄙无耻的手段迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者，妄图封锁真理的声音，妄图阻遏伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭香港爱国同胞反英抗暴的烈火，完全是痴心妄想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵小将和七亿中国人民，是不可侮的，是不好惹的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港爱国同胞，是吓不倒，压不垮的。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，必将在香港上空高高飘扬。
    首都无产阶级革命派在讲话中还向坚持反英抗暴斗争的香港爱国同胞表示崇高的敬意。他们热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞的斗争表现了中国人民大无畏的英勇气概，香港爱国同胞是毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的英雄儿女。他们指出，香港是中国的领土，香港爱国同胞的英勇斗争表明，香港的命运要由中国人民来掌握。有七亿祖国人民作后盾，香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争必将赢得最后的胜利。
