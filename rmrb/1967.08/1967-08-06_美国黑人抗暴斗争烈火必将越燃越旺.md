The armed resistance by American blacks has developed with the ferocity of a volcanic eruption since the beginning of summer this year. The intensity, scale, and rapid spread of this struggle are unprecedented in American history over the past century. In just two months, from early June to the end of July, the flames of resistance have spread like wildfire across more than ninety cities in dozens of states across the southern, northern, eastern, and western regions of the United States.

In late July, the black masses in Detroit took up arms and fought street by street against more than twenty thousand armed police and military personnel dispatched by the Johnson administration, equipped with aircraft and tanks. In just three or four days, they reduced half of this center of the American automobile industry to ruins, turning it into a "dead city." Inspired and driven by the black struggle in Detroit, the black masses in more than twenty other cities also rose up in resistance and self-defense. Even in the heavily guarded capital of the American reactionary government, Washington, the impoverished blacks bravely took up arms for the first time to fight back against the military police's suppression, bringing the flames of resistance to Johnson's doorstep.

The intense development of armed resistance by American blacks has dealt a heavy blow to the Johnson reactionary government, causing great alarm in Washington and throughout the American ruling class. Johnson could not help but ask in panic, "What has happened? Why has this happened?"

Is there anything strange about this? Not at all. The rapid development of the resistance by American blacks is the result of their long-term enslavement, oppression, and discrimination, and the inevitable outcome of the development of class struggle within the United States.

The more than twenty million blacks in the United States are at the bottom of society. They have long been subjected to the double oppression of racial discrimination and class exploitation. Four years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement supporting the struggle of American blacks: "The discrimination and persecution suffered by American blacks are particularly shocking."

The savage racial oppression and cruel class oppression weigh heavily on American blacks like two mountains. They do the hardest labor, eat the coarsest food, and live in slums like living hells. In the scorching summer heat, the low, dark, and stuffy shacks are unbearable. They have the lowest incomes and the highest unemployment rates, with wages only one-third to one-half of whites and unemployment rates exceeding those of whites by one and a half to five times. Due to severe unemployment, many black families cannot sustain themselves, leading to marital separations and children dropping out of school. They have the lowest status and the fewest rights. In many states, they not only do not get the same employment and voting rights as whites but also cannot live in the same houses, work in the same rooms, attend the same schools, eat at the same tables, or even travel in the same cars. Their lives are also the least secure, as they can be bullied, arrested, and killed by the reactionary government and racists at any time. This double oppression makes the broad masses of blacks in 20th-century America actually live a life worse than cattle in the 17th-century era of black slavery.

In recent years, as American imperialism has intensified its external aggression and expansion, particularly its escalation of the war in Vietnam, the American ruling class has further intensified its exploitation of blacks and conscripted more black youth into the military to be used as cannon fodder in South Vietnam. In the new recruits of the U.S. Army, the proportion of blacks has been increasing. Blacks make up only 11% of the U.S. population, but 25% of those conscripted are black. The death rate of blacks in the Vietnam War is also higher than that of whites. Especially in the paratrooper units that bear the brunt of the fighting, the death rate of blacks is as high as 40%.

The exploitation and oppression by American monopoly capital and the reactionary government will inevitably provoke the resistance and struggle of American blacks. The more severe the oppression, the more intense the resistance. An increasing number of American blacks have come to realize from their long-term personal experiences that their fate of poverty, humiliation, powerlessness, and death is entirely the result of the cannibalistic system of American imperialism and the reactionary policies of the American ruling class. The rising revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and especially the victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, have also promoted the awakening of American blacks and inspired their fighting spirit. To change their fate of being enslaved, oppressed, and discriminated against, the only way is to rebel, to struggle, and to overthrow the rule of American monopoly capital. The so-called "Civil Rights Act" played by the Johnson government and the so-called "non-violentism" advocated by the black lackeys of American monopoly capital are nothing but lies. Only through violent struggle and violent revolution can they achieve a thorough liberation and emancipation.

The fundamental contradiction between the more than twenty million American blacks and American monopoly capital is irreconcilable. This contradiction can only and must be resolved through revolution. As the American ruling class intensifies its oppression and suppression, the armed resistance of American blacks will become more intense and surging.

### 美国黑人抗暴斗争烈火必将越燃越旺

    美国黑人抗暴斗争烈火必将越燃越旺
    今年入夏以来，美国黑人武装抗暴斗争好象火山爆发一样猛烈地发展起来。其斗争之烈，规模之大，扩展之快，是美国百年来所未有的。仅仅从六月初到七月底的两个月内，抗暴斗争的烈火，就以燎原之势，燃遍了美国南北东西几十个州的九十多个城市。
    七月下旬，底特律的黑人群众鸣枪而起，逐街而战，同约翰逊政府派出的两万多名配备着飞机、坦克的武装军警展开了一场激烈的大搏斗。在短短的三、四天时间内，他们就把美国这个汽车工业中心的大半地区打得断垣残壁，变成一座“死城”。在底特律黑人斗争的鼓舞和推动之下，其他二十多个城市的黑人群众也奋起抗暴自卫。甚至连警卫森严的美国反动政府所在地华盛顿，贫苦黑人也英勇不屈地第一次拿起武器反击军警镇压，把抗暴斗争的烈火烧到了约翰逊的脚下。
    美国黑人武装抗暴斗争的猛烈发展，给了约翰逊反动政府以沉重的打击，使华盛顿官场和整个美国统治集团大为震动。约翰逊不禁惊慌失措地问道：“发生了什么情况？为什么发生这种情况？”
    难道这有什么奇怪的吗？一点也不奇怪。美国黑人抗暴斗争的迅猛发展，是美国黑人长期被奴役、被压迫和被歧视的结果，是美国国内阶级斗争发展的必然结果。
    美国的二千多万黑人处在社会的最底层。他们一直受着种族歧视和阶级剥削的双重压迫。毛主席在四年前发表的支持美国黑人斗争的声明中指出：“美国黑人所受到的歧视和迫害，是特别骇人听闻的。”
    野蛮的种族压迫和残酷的阶级压迫，就象两座大山那样沉重地压在美国黑人的身上。他们干的是最繁重的劳动，吃的是最粗劣的食物，住的是象活地狱一样的贫民窟，特别是在赤日炎炎的盛暑，低矮、阴暗、闷热的棚户更是不堪忍受。他们收入最低，失业最多，工资只及白人的三分之一到二分之一，失业率超过白人的一倍半到五倍。由于失业严重，大量黑人家庭不能维持，夫妻离散，子女失学。他们地位最低，权利最少。在许多州里，他们不但得不到同白人一样的就业权利，选举权利，甚至不能和白人同屋居住，同室工作，同校读书，同桌吃饭，甚至同车旅行。他们的生命也最没有保障，随时都会遭到反动政府和种族主义者的欺凌、逮捕和杀害。这种双重的压榨，使二十世纪的美国广大黑人，实际上仍然过着十七世纪黑奴时代的牛马不如的奴隶生活。
    近几年来，随着美帝国主义加紧对外侵略扩张，特别是扩大侵越战争，美国统治集团进一步加强了对黑人的压榨，并把更多的黑人青年强征入伍，送到南越去充当炮灰。在美国陆军征召的新兵中，黑人所占的比率越来越高。黑人只占美国全国人口的百分之十一，但是被征入伍的黑人却占总人数的百分之二十五。黑人在侵越战争中的死亡率也比白人为高。特别是担负战斗主力的伞兵部队中，黑人死亡率竟高达百分之四十。
    美国垄断资本和美国反动政府的剥削压迫，必然要激起美国黑人的反抗和斗争。压迫愈甚，反抗愈烈。越来越多的美国黑人已经从长期的切身体验中认识到，他们遭受这种贫困、屈辱、无权和死亡的命运，完全是由美帝国主义的吃人制度，由美国统治集团的反动政策造成的。亚非拉各国人民革命斗争的高涨，特别是越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利，也促进了美国黑人的觉醒，鼓舞了他们的斗志。为了改变他们被奴役、被压迫和被歧视的命运，唯一办法是起来造反，起来斗争，推翻美国垄断资本的统治。约翰逊政府所玩弄的什么“民权法”，美国垄断资本御用的黑人走狗所宣扬的什么“非暴力主义”，都不过是骗人的鬼话。只有进行暴力斗争，暴力革命，才能彻底翻身，彻底解放。
    美国二千多万黑人同美国垄断资本的阶级矛盾是根本不可调和的。这个矛盾只能也必定要通过革命来解决。随着美国统治集团的加紧压迫和镇压，美国黑人的抗暴斗争必将更加激烈更加高涨起来。（附图片）
