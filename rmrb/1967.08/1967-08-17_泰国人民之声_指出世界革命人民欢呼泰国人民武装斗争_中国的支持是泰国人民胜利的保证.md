"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 12th, stating that the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, firmly and unwaveringly support the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. This is the most powerful support for the Thai people to defeat the enemy.

The article said, the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people is a part of the world revolution. Currently, revolutionary people from all over the world are closely watching, encouraging, and supporting the armed struggle of the Thai people. The development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces are being cheered by the revolutionary people of the world, while imperialism and all reactionaries are extremely panicked.

The article emphasized that the current world revolutionary situation is very good. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries is flourishing. The revolutionary tide is surging, and the flames of armed struggle by the people of various countries are burning fiercely. The socialist China, which U.S. imperialism and its running dogs fear the most, has achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world revolutionary people, and has become even stronger, becoming the most solid revolutionary stronghold for the revolutionary people of the world. The article concluded by pointing out that the world revolutionary situation is greatly favorable to the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat sellout clique are surrounded by the people and cannot escape their doom. As long as the Thai people unite closely and persist in armed struggle, they will surely achieve revolutionary victory soon and make contributions to the world revolution.

    “泰国人民之声”指出世界革命人民欢呼泰国人民武装斗争
    中国的支持是泰国人民胜利的保证
    据新华社十四日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十二日广播一篇文章指出，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚定不移地全力支持泰国人民的革命斗争，这是对泰国人民战胜敌人的最有力的支持。
    文章说，泰国人民的革命斗争是世界革命的一个组成部分。目前，世界各国革命人民正在密切关注、鼓舞和支持泰国人民的武装斗争。泰国人民武装的发展壮大受到世界革命人民的欢呼，而帝国主义和一切反动派却感到非常恐慌。
    文章强调指出，目前世界革命形势好得很，世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争正在蓬勃发展，革命潮流正在高涨，各国人民武装斗争的烈火正在熊熊燃烧。美帝国主义及其走狗最害怕的社会主义中国，在世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，变得更加强大，成为全世界革命人民的最坚固的革命堡垒。文章最后指出，世界革命形势大大有利于泰国人民的革命斗争。美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团正处在人民的包围中，它们无法摆脱灭亡的下场。只要泰国人民紧密团结，坚持武装斗争，就必将早日取得革命的胜利，并给世界革命作出贡献。
