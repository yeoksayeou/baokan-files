The theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the essence of Marxism-Leninism. Whether to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat or to oppose it has always been the focal point of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and all kinds of revisionism, and the dividing line between all genuine proletarian revolutionaries and traitors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, there were two possible choices: either to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat, to carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and to push the revolution to the end; or to betray the dictatorship of the proletariat, to declare that class struggle has been extinguished and that classes no longer exist, and to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

At this critical moment, the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, published the brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," along with a series of important instructions. For the first time in the history of the development of Marxism, he scientifically, systematically, and profoundly expounded on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. He comprehensively and thoroughly solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice, pushing Marxism-Leninism to a brilliant new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce. 'There are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system, and they will fight against the working class in all aspects, including the ideological struggle.'"

However, at this critical moment, Chinese Khrushchev jumped out and openly opposed Mao Zedong Thought, brazenly advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and blathering on about how "after the public-private partnership, the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved," and how "now the domestic enemies have been basically eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, and the bourgeoisie has also been basically eliminated," and how "class struggle has basically ended."

What "theory of the extinction of class struggle"! Just because the means of production have been transformed and the exploiting class has been deprived of their means of production, does that mean the classes have been eliminated? Does that mean the class struggle has been extinguished? This is a blatant lie. This is the most naked betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Class is not only an economic concept but also, more importantly, a political concept. In the thousands of years of ruling, the exploiting class not only occupied the dominant economic position but also the dominant political, ideological, and cultural positions. Therefore, the existence of classes depends not only on economic status but also on political attitudes and ideological tendencies. Class struggle includes political struggle, economic struggle, and ideological struggle, and the struggle on the political and ideological fronts is more intense and brutal than the struggle on the economic front. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, "landlords have no land," "rich peasants are not rich," and "capitalists have no capital"—this is great! This is the victory of the socialist revolution, the result of the transformation of the ownership of the means of production. They have lost their means of production and their political ruling position, but the strength of the exploiting class is still strong. They can still exist by relying on their traditional influence in the realms of ideology and culture. If we only carry out the socialist revolution on the economic front and do not carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts and the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we will not be able to thoroughly transform the members of the exploiting class and ultimately eliminate the classes.

The reality of class struggle tells us: although the bourgeois elements have become managers in public-private partnership enterprises, they still receive dividends and have not severed their roots of exploitation. "Even if they do not receive dividends and remove the bourgeois hat, they still need a considerable amount of time to continue their ideological transformation." Landlords have been deprived of their land, but they still hide land deeds and continue their family genealogies, always ready to use their "reversal account." Even rich peasants have not forgotten their past lives of exploitation! Chairman Mao pointed out: "The social economic system has changed, but the reactionary ideology, that is, bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology left over from the old society, still persists in the minds of a considerable number of people. This will take time to change, and it will take a very long time. This is the class struggle in society."

The existence of the bourgeoisie and its influence will inevitably infiltrate the ranks of the proletariat and find its agents within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are the most important and dangerous class enemies under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They usurp leadership positions, turning the authority of leadership into privileges to oppress and exploit the people; they recruit and collude, forming factions to attempt to implement bourgeois dictatorship and restore capitalism. Are they not a new batch of capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants? The "new-style" capitalists that Chinese Khrushchev talks about, are they not his own self-description?

In this situation, class struggle continues to exist, but the forms of struggle change with the changes in the situation. One of the most prominent features of this change in the forms of struggle is that the enemy has burrowed into our vitals. They attempt to open a breach from within, to stage a palace coup, to usurp the party, the army, and the government. Therefore, class struggle has become even more acute and complex.

Do not think that because "landlords have no land," "rich peasants are not rich," and "capitalists have no capital," everything is fine and we can rest easy. Once this group of most dangerous enemies seizes power, at that time, "landless landlords" will turn back into land-owning landlords, "non-rich rich peasants" will be able to exploit and become rich again, and "capitalists without capital" will turn back into capitalists with capital.

In the Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia, and in some so-called socialist countries in Eastern Europe, this has already become an undeniable reality.

Chinese Khrushchev advocates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and promotes the "theory of the withering away of the state," which inevitably leads to the complete negation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. One piece of evidence is that in 1962, when Chinese Khrushchev re-edited and published "Cultivation," he once again cut out the phrase "the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary" from a quote from Lenin. He also said: "Class struggle has basically ended, there are fewer counter-revolutionaries, and there are fewer criminals, so the organs of state dictatorship can be reduced... In the future, the most important task of the state is to organize social life."

What a "organization of social life"!

I ask: what kind of "social life" is this "organization" supposed to organize? In a class society, is there a classless "society"? Does a "social life" without any class struggle exist? What kind of "state" is this "organization of social life" supposed to be?

What is a state? Chairman Mao said, "Our state machine is a tool for one class to oppress another. It is a tool of oppression against the enemy class, and it is violence." At the same time, "the people's state is a protector of the people. With the people's state, the people can, on a national scale and in a comprehensive manner, use democratic methods to educate and transform themselves."

Our state is a machine that practices democracy within the people and dictatorship over the people's enemies, a machine that practices the dictatorship of the proletariat. During the entire transition period from socialism to communism, the dictatorial function of the state machine cannot be weakened but must be strengthened. Chinese Khrushchev opposes the dictatorial function of the state by advocating that "the organs of state dictatorship can be reduced" and that "the most important task of the state is to organize social life." In essence, he is attacking and erasing the dictatorial function of the state, using the so-called "people's state" to replace the socialist state and using bourgeois dictatorship to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"Organizing social life" is also a sharp class struggle. Against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the broad revolutionary masses must wage a struggle against them, "organize" them to undergo labor reform, and force them to confess their crimes, allowing them to behave only in a disciplined manner and not to cause trouble. Within the people, we must also continuously use the "four great freedoms" to carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The bourgeoisie dreams of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the proletariat must do the opposite and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat a thousand times over. As early as eighteen years ago, Chairman Mao taught us that the dictatorship of the proletariat "is something that the victorious people cannot do without for a moment, like cloth, grains, and beans." "This is a good thing, a protective talisman, a family heirloom. Until the day when imperialism abroad and classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated, this talisman must not be discarded and not used."

The state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as a tool of class struggle, will gradually wither away after the imperialism abroad and the classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated, fulfilling its historical mission. However, to achieve this, we must consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. To abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat in the future, we must greatly consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat now; to achieve the withering away of the state in the future, we must greatly strengthen the state machine now. The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate the class enemies who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev, to eliminate their poison in politics, ideology, theory, organization, and other aspects, and to fundamentally strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. People will see that through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our state of the dictatorship of the proletariat will truly become an iron fortress.

What "theory of the extinction of class struggle," what "theory of the withering away of the state," are all lies. Not talking about class struggle is itself a form of the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the proletariat. Advocating that "the organs of state dictatorship can be reduced" is hoping to reduce the function of the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie and greatly expand the bourgeoisie's dictatorship over the proletariat. This is a life-and-death class struggle. This struggle is concentrated in the struggle between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters. The focus of the struggle has always been the question of power. On the bourgeois side, the leader has always been Chinese Khrushchev. The counter-revolutionary "theory" is provided by him, the counter-revolutionary activities are planned by him, and he is the backer of all reactionary forces in China.

In this unprecedented and profound Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chinese Khrushchev can no longer hide. The magnificent mass movement has forced him from behind the scenes to the forefront, personally donning armor and taking to the battlefield. The small lackeys of his bourgeois headquarters have also come out in full force. This is good. With a decisive battle, there will be a great victory. The result of the decisive battle is that in the face of the powerful proletarian headquarters, the bourgeois troops have fallen one batch after another. In the march of the proletarian revolutionaries' all-out offensive, they have been routed. According to the ruthless dialectics of history, this bourgeois headquarters will inevitably be completely annihilated and thoroughly smashed.

The struggle is deepening, and we have achieved great victories. However, we must not relax for a moment. As Lenin pointed out in "Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky": "The proletariat cannot achieve its world revolutionary goal without waging a merciless struggle against such renegade acts..." To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to plant the bright red flag of communism in every corner of the earth, let us continue to wage a "merciless struggle" against this traitor who has betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    无产阶级专政和叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫
   《文汇报》编辑部　《解放日报》编辑部　《支部生活》编辑部
    无产阶级专政的学说，是马克思列宁主义的精髓。坚持无产阶级专政还是反对无产阶级专政，从来就是马克思列宁主义同一切形形色色的修正主义斗争的焦点，是一切真正的无产阶级革命家同无产阶级革命事业的叛徒的分水岭。
    我国在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，面临着两种可能的选择：或者坚持无产阶级专政，开展政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，把革命进行到底；或者背叛无产阶级专政，宣布阶级斗争已经熄灭，阶级已不存在，实现资本主义复辟。
    就在这个关键时刻，中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等光辉著作和一系列重要指示，在马克思主义发展史上第一次科学地、系统地、深刻地论证了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，从理论上和实践上全面地、彻底地解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命的问题，把马克思列宁主义推进到一个光辉灿烂的新阶段——毛泽东思想阶段。
    毛主席明确指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”“社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却在这个关键时刻跳出来，公然反对毛泽东思想，放肆地宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说什么“公私合营以后，无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”，“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本上消灭了”，“阶级斗争已经基本上结束”。
    什么“阶级斗争熄灭”论！改造了所有制，剥夺了剥削阶级的生产资料，难道阶级就消灭了吗？阶级斗争就熄灭了吗？这是一个道道地地的大骗局。这是对无产阶级专政的最赤裸裸的大背叛！
    阶级，不仅是个经济概念，更主要的还是个政治概念。剥削阶级在几千年的统治过程中，不仅占有经济上的统治地位，并且占有政治、思想、文化上的统治地位。因此，阶级的存在，不仅取决于经济地位，同时也还受着政治态度和思想倾向的支配和影响。阶级斗争，包括政治斗争、经济斗争、思想斗争这样几种形式，而政治战线和思想战线上的斗争，要比经济战线上的斗争激烈得多，残酷得多。在无产阶级专政条件下，“地主无地”，“富农不富”，“资本家没有资本”，好得很！这是社会主义革命的胜利，是生产资料所有制改造的结果。他们的生产资料没有了，政治上也失去了统治地位，但是，剥削阶级的力量还很强大，他们照样可以依附于思想、文化上的统治地位或其传统影响而继续存在。只搞经济战线上的社会主义革命，不搞政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，不搞无产阶级文化大革命，就不能彻底改造剥削阶级分子，就不能最后消灭阶级。
    阶级斗争的现实告诉我们：资产阶级分子尽管已经成为公私合营企业中的管理人员，但他们还在拿定息，还没有脱离剥削根子。“就是不拿定息，摘掉了资产阶级的帽子，也还需要一个相当的时间继续进行思想改造。”地主已被剥夺了土地，但他们仍在藏地契、续家谱，时刻都在掂着那本变天帐。就是富农，又何尝忘得了昔日的剥削生活呢！毛主席指出：“社会经济制度变了，旧时代遗留下来残存于相当大的一部分人们头脑里的反动思想，亦即资产阶级思想和上层小资产阶级思想，一下子变不过来。要变需要时间，并且需要很长的时间，这是社会上的阶级斗争。”
    资产阶级及其影响的存在，还必然会侵蚀无产阶级的队伍，在无产阶级专政机构内部寻找它的代理人。他们是无产阶级专政条件下最主要的、最危险的阶级敌人。他们窃据领导岗位，把领导的职权变为压迫、剥削人民群众的特权；他们招降纳叛，结党营私，妄图实行资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。他们岂不就是一批新的资本家，新的地主、富农吗？中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“新式”的资本家，岂不就是他的夫子自道吗？
    在这种情况下，阶级斗争继续存在，只是斗争的形式随着形势的变化而有所变化罢了。这种斗争形式变化的一个最大的特点，就是敌人钻到了我们的肝脏里，他们妄图从内部打开缺口，搞宫廷政变，篡党、篡军、篡政。因此，阶级斗争越发尖锐复杂了。
    不要以为“地主无地”，“富农不富”，“资本家没有资本”，就万事大吉，可以高枕无忧。一旦这帮最危险的敌人篡夺了政权，到那时，“没有土地的地主”就会重新转化为拥有土地的地主，
  “不富的富农”又可以剥削致富，“没有资本的资本家”又会重新转化为拥有资本的资本家。
    在苏联，在南斯拉夫，在东欧的一些所谓社会主义国家，这已经是无庸辩驳的现实。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，鼓吹“国家消亡”论，必然导致彻底否定无产阶级专政。一个证据是，中国赫鲁晓夫在一九六二年重新修改出版《修养》时，他又一次在引用列宁的一段话中，把“无产阶级专政是必要的”这句话拦腰砍掉了。他还说：“阶级斗争基本结束，反革命分子少了，刑事犯也少了，所以国家专政的机构可以缩小了，……今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活。”
    好一个“组织社会生活”！
    试问：所谓“组织社会生活”，究竟是“组织”什么样的“社会生活”？在阶级社会里，究竟有没有超阶级的“社会”？存在不存在没有烟火气的“社会生活”？这种“组织社会生活”的国家又究竟是怎样一种“国家”？
    什么是国家？毛主席说，我们的国家机器“是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力”。同时，“人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己”。
    我们的国家是在人民内部实行民主、对人民的敌人实行专政的机器，是实行无产阶级专政的机器。在整个从社会主义到共产主义的过渡时期，国家机器的专政的职能，不能削弱，只能加强。中国赫鲁晓夫把所谓“组织社会生活”同国家的专政职能对立起来，强调“国家专政的机构可以缩小”，“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”，实质上就是竭力攻击和抹煞国家的专政职能，用所谓“全民国家”来代替社会主义国家，用资产阶级专政来代替无产阶级专政。
      “组织社会生活”，也是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对于地、富、反、坏、右，广大革命群众要对他们进行斗争，要“组织”他们劳动改造，要迫使他们低头认罪，只准他们规规矩矩，不准他们乱说乱动。在人民内部，也要不断运用“四大民主”，开展灭资兴无的斗争，不断肃清资产阶级思想的影响，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    资产阶级梦寐以求，一心想搞垮无产阶级专政，无产阶级就必须反其道而行之，千百倍地加强无产阶级专政。早在十八年前毛主席就教导我们，无产阶级专政“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。”“这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的”。
    无产阶级专政的国家，作为阶级斗争的工具，在国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底、干净地消灭之后，必然将逐步地消亡下去，完成自己的历史使命。但是，要做到这一点，只有巩固和加强无产阶级专政。为了将来取消无产阶级专政，现在必须大大巩固和加强无产阶级专政；为了将来国家的消亡，现在必须大大强化国家机器。这次无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，就是要清除混到无产阶级专政机构内部的阶级敌人，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，肃清他们在政治、思想、理论、组织等各方面的流毒，从根本上强化和巩固无产阶级专政。人们将看到，通过无产阶级文化大革命的烈火锻炼，我们无产阶级专政的国家将真正成为坚如磐石的铁打江山。
    什么“阶级斗争熄灭”论，什么“国家消亡”论，都是弥天大谎。不讲阶级斗争，本身就是资产阶级向无产阶级疯狂进攻的一种形式。主张“国家专政的机构可以缩小”，就是希望缩小无产阶级对资产阶级专政的职能，而大大扩大资产阶级对无产阶级的专政。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。这场斗争，集中表现为无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，表现为无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的斗争。斗争的焦点始终是一个政权问题。在资产阶级方面，挂帅的人物始终是中国赫鲁晓夫。反革命的“理论”是他提供的，反革命的活动是他策划的，他是中国一切反动势力的总后台。
    在这次空前宏伟、空前深刻的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫再也藏不住了，波澜壮阔的群众运动，迫使他从幕后转到台前，亲自披挂上阵。他的资产阶级司令部的大小娄罗，也倾巢而出。这很好。有了总决战，才有大胜利。总决战的结果，在强大的无产阶级司令部面前，资产阶级的梯队一批又一批倒了下去。在无产阶级革命派全线出击的进军号中，他们溃不成军了。按照无情的历史辩证法，这个资产阶级司令部必定要全军覆灭，彻底摧毁。
    斗争在深入，我们已取得了伟大的胜利。但是，我们一刻也不能松气。正如列宁在《无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基》一文中指出的：“工人阶级不进行无情的战斗，来反对这种叛徒行径……便不能实现它的世界革命的目的。”为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为了在地球的每一个角落都插上鲜红鲜红的共产主义的红旗，让我们对这个背叛无产阶级专政的大叛徒，继续展开“无情的战斗”吧！　（新华社上海二十五日电）
