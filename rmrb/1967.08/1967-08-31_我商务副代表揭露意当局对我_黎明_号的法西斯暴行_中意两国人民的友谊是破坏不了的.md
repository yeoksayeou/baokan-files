	Chinese Deputy Commercial Representative Exposes Italian Authorities' Fascist Atrocities Against the "Morning Star"
	The Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Italy Cannot Be Destroyed

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th: A message from Rome: On the 26th, Liu Ruoming, Deputy Representative of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in Italy, held a press conference in Rome. He condemned the Italian authorities for their political provocation and fascist persecution of the Chinese cargo ship "Morning Star." He solemnly declared that if the Italian authorities do not stop and correct their mistakes, they will be fully responsible for the serious consequences that follow.

	At the meeting, Liu Ruoming first read a quote from Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

	Liu Ruoming then exposed the details of the Italian authorities' political provocation against the "Morning Star."

	Liu Ruoming pointed out that the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities have caused great indignation among all the crew members of the "Morning Star," who have strongly protested against this.

	He said that hanging Chairman Mao's quotations on a Chinese ship and studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought are the sacred rights of Chinese sailors. The Italian authorities' unreasonable demands are a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a naked anti-China act. This action exposes the ugly face of the Italian authorities in their crazy anti-China stance, following the lead of imperialism and revisionism.

	Liu Ruoming emphasized that due to the Italian authorities' unreasonable restrictions on the normal business activities of the Chinese commercial representative and their repeated disregard for warnings and protests from the Chinese side, the Chinese side was forced to take corresponding measures to restrict the activities of the Italian commercial representative in Beijing. He said that the Italian authorities have now admitted their mistakes and withdrawn their illegal measures against the Chinese commercial representative in Italy, and the Chinese side has also withdrawn the restrictions on the Italian commercial representative.

	Liu Ruoming said that the patience of the Chinese people has its limits. If the Italian authorities insist on their mistakes and continue to disrupt trade and maritime communications between the two countries, the Chinese people will resolutely fight back. This incident was provoked by the Italian authorities, and its resolution also depends on them.

	He emphasized that the Italian authorities' anti-China actions will not end well. If the Italian authorities do not acknowledge and correct their mistakes, the consequences will be very serious, and they must bear full responsibility.

	Finally, the Deputy Representative of the Chinese Commercial Office expressed gratitude to all friends who have supported and stood by the crew of the "Morning Star" and the Chinese people, and emphasized that the friendship between the peoples of China and Italy cannot be destroyed by anyone.

    我商务副代表揭露意当局对我“黎明”号的法西斯暴行
    中意两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的
    据新华社二十九日讯　罗马消息：中国国际贸易促进委员会驻意大利商务代表处副代表刘若明二十六日在罗马举行记者招待会，谴责意大利当局对中国货轮“黎明”号进行政治挑衅和法西斯迫害。他严正表示：意大利当局如不悬崖勒马，改正错误，由此产生的严重后果概由意大利当局负责。
    刘若明在会上首先朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    刘若明接着揭露了意大利当局对“黎明”号进行政治挑衅的经过。
    刘若明指出，意大利当局的法西斯暴行激起“黎明”号全体船员极大愤慨，他们对此提出最强烈的抗议。
    他说，在中国船上悬挂毛主席语录，学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是中国船员的神圣权利。意大利当局的无理要求，是对中国内政的粗暴的干涉，是赤裸裸的反华行为。这一行动暴露了意大利当局追随帝国主义、修正主义疯狂反华的丑恶的嘴脸。
    刘若明强调指出，由于意大利当局无理限制中国商务代表进行正常业务的活动自由，并一再无视中国方面的警告和抗议，中国方面才被迫采取了相应的措施，限制意大利驻京商务代表的活动。他说，现在意大利当局已承认了错误，撤销了对中国驻意大利商务代表的非法措施，中国方面也随即撤销了对意商务代表的限制。
    刘若明说，中国人民的耐心是有限度的。如果意大利当局坚持错误，继续破坏两国之间的贸易往来和海上交通，中国人民将坚决予以回击。这个事件是由意大利当局挑起的，这个事件的解决也取决于它们。
    他强调说，意大利当局反华决不会有好下场。如果意大利当局不承认自己的错误，并改正错误的话，其后果将是十分严重的，他们对此必须承担全部责任。
    中国商务代表处副代表最后向所有对“黎明”号船员和中国人民表示支持和声援的朋友表示感谢，并强调说，中意两国人民的友谊是任何人破坏不了的。
