Inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and the correct directives of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the farmers of the Albanian mountains have rapidly embarked on the path of agricultural cooperativization. The new rural areas of the mountains, after cooperativization, present a scene of unprecedented prosperity everywhere.

Before the Albanian Party of Labour held its Fifth Congress (November 1, 1966 - November 8, 1966), about 10% of the land and about 20% of the households in the Albanian countryside (most of which were in the mountains) had not yet achieved cooperativization. The Fifth Congress of the Labour Party called on the farmers who had not yet been organized to achieve agricultural cooperativization on the basis of voluntarism. This call immediately received a warm response from the broad masses of farmers in the mountains. Within a short period of about two months, 31,000 households of farmers were organized and 511 agricultural production cooperatives were established.

The process of establishing agricultural production cooperatives was not smooth. All domestic and foreign class enemies feared the new victories of socialism in the Albanian countryside. They used every means to sabotage the cooperativization movement. The overthrown kulaks said that the poor gorges, the heavy snow in winter, and the inconvenient transportation made it impossible to cooperativize. Reactionaries disguised as religious figures used religion to obstruct farmers from joining cooperatives in every possible way. The Yugoslav revisionists were even more vicious, sending agents to sabotage. However, under the correct leadership of the Labour Party, the broad masses of farmers waged a resolute struggle against the class enemies, smashing all their plots. Five hundred and eleven new agricultural production cooperatives sprouted and grew like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the mountains.

After joining the cooperatives, the broad masses of farmers voluntarily handed over most of their land, tools, and seeds to the cooperatives without compensation. Many newly established agricultural production cooperatives, from the first day of their establishment, reduced the private plots from the originally stipulated 0.3 hectares per household to 0.1 to 0.15 hectares per household, and reduced the number of private livestock. In some areas, the members handed over their surplus livestock to the cooperatives at a discounted price or without compensation to establish collective herds.

After the establishment of the new cooperatives, the broad masses of farmers continued to wage a resolute struggle against the sabotage activities of the class enemies and against the old ideas, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes left over from the old society.

Through the cooperativization movement and the study and discussion of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Labour Party, Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" on February 6 this year, and other documents, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of mountain farmers has been greatly heightened. They have already seen the superiority of the cooperative system and the bright future. Many members said: "One finger cannot exert force, but five fingers clenched together form a fist, which has strength. Socialism cooperativization is good." The broad masses of members actively responded to Comrade Enver Hoxha's call to "turn the hills and mountains into plains" and remembered the Party's teachings on the special significance of agricultural production, especially the self-sufficiency of people's food, under the conditions of imperialist and revisionist economic blockade and the current and possible future international situation, and launched a wave of agricultural production centered on grain production.

As early as last year after the establishment of the cooperatives, the broad masses of members turned winter idleness into winter busyness, actively reclaimed wasteland, built terraces, developed water conservancy, and repaired roads. In the Puke District, farmers reclaimed more new wasteland in less than a year after cooperativization than in the thirteen years before cooperativization. In the Dibra District, the speed of reclamation increased significantly after cooperativization, and the reclamation plan for the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) is expected to be completed two years ahead of schedule. In the Tropoja District, after cooperativization, six households of farmers voluntarily went to the mountains at an altitude of 1,500 meters to reclaim wasteland and establish new settlements. In terms of water conservancy, many cooperatives, in addition to participating in some large-scale water conservancy projects invested by the state as voluntary labor, also self-reliantly built many small reservoirs, canals, and ponds.

This year, as soon as spring arrived, the newly established agricultural cooperatives in the mountains presented an even more lively scene of early spring and diligent people. Members worked on the fields where the boundaries and fences marking the small peasant economy had been removed, and they seemed particularly cheerful. This year's spring sowing area has generally expanded compared to last year. Many agricultural cooperatives have formulated specific measures to strive for self-sufficiency in grain in the next few years. Farmers in the Dibra District proposed to strive for grain self-sufficiency as early as next year.

Through the cooperativization movement, the relationship among the broad masses of members has undergone great changes. Before liberation, the villages of Gjebaj and Lekbaj in the Dibra District had long-standing disputes over irrigation water. After cooperativization, the farmers of the two villages united to dig canals for irrigation and became very harmonious.

Through the cooperativization movement, the Party organization has absorbed a batch of awakened farmers who emerged in the movement into the Party; Party organizations have been established in villages that previously had none; and a batch of cooperative leaders have been trained and selected. The Party organizations at all levels have also paid attention to training women to take up leadership positions in the cooperatives. The cadres of the new agricultural cooperatives actively participate in labor, which has further strengthened the connection between the cadres and the masses and encouraged the members' enthusiasm for production.

In the process of mountain cooperativization, a batch of outstanding workers, Party members, and cadres from various departments actively responded to the Party's call to "make agriculture a matter for the whole people" and "strengthen the worker-peasant alliance," and went to the mountains to help with cooperativization. The Puke District's Fushë-Arles Forest Development Company had 100 worker Party members settle down in the new agricultural cooperatives for the long term; the Lushnjë Steel Plant, led by Deputy Director Nadreka, had 29 Party member cadres go to the new agricultural cooperatives to work.

To support the production of the new agricultural cooperatives, the Albanian people's government has greatly expanded the investment in soil improvement and water conservancy in the mountainous and hilly areas, built more state-owned tractor stations, and prioritized the supply of fertilizers, seeds, and a large amount of pesticides and building materials to the new agricultural production cooperatives.

Albanian youth go deep into the northern mountains, hacking through cliffs and building roads on steep slopes.

### 在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党“五大”的鼓舞下  阿山区农民在合作化大道上阔步前进

    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党“五大”的鼓舞下
    阿山区农民在合作化大道上阔步前进
    据新华社地拉那电　本社记者报道：在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议和霍查同志正确指示的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚山区农民迅速走上了农业合作化的道路。合作化后的山区新农村，到处呈现出一片空前的兴旺景象。
    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党举行第五次代表大会（一九六六年十一月一日——八日）之前，阿尔巴尼亚农村中还有约百分之十的土地和约百分之二十的农户（绝大部分在山区）没有实现合作化。劳动党第五次代表大会号召尚未组织起来的农民在自愿原则基础上实现农业合作化。劳动党的这一号召立即得到山区广大农民的热烈响应，在短短两个月左右的时间内，就有三万一千户农民组织起来，成立了五百十一个农业生产合作社。
    粉碎敌人阴谋　建立新农业合作社
    成立农业生产合作社的过程并不是一帆风顺的。一切国内外的阶级敌人害怕社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚农村中的新胜利。他们千方百计地破坏合作化运动。被打倒了的富农们说什么穷山沟，冬天大雪封山，交通不便，不能合作化。披着宗教外衣的反动分子利用宗教，百般阻挠农民参加合作社。毗邻阿尔巴尼亚的南斯拉夫修正主义者更恶毒地派特务进来破坏。但是，广大农民在劳动党的正确领导下，同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了敌人的各种阴谋。五百十一个新的农业生产合作社象雨后春笋一样，在山区发芽成长。
    广大农民入社后，自愿把大部分土地、农具和种子无偿交给合作社。许多新成立的农业生产合作社从建社头一天起，就把自留地从原规定的每户零点三公顷，减少到每户零点一到零点一五公顷，并削减自留牲畜的数量，有些地区的社员把多余的牲畜折价或无偿交给合作社，以便建立集体畜群。
    新的合作社成立后，广大农民继续同阶级敌人的破坏活动进行坚决的斗争，还同旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级旧思想、旧风俗、旧习惯进行了斗争。
    广大山区农民通过合作化运动，通过对劳动党“五大”的决议、霍查同志今年二月六日“关于党和政权进一步革命化”的讲话等的学习讨论，社会主义觉悟大大提高。他们已经看到了合作社制度的优越性和未来的光辉远景。许多社员说：“一个指头使不上劲，五个指头捏起来，成了一个拳头，才有力量。社会主义合作化就是好。”广大社员积极响应霍查同志关于“把丘陵和山区变得象平原那样富饶”的号召，牢记劳动党关于在帝国主义和修正主义经济封锁的条件下，在目前国际形势及其今后可能发展的情况下，农业生产，特别是人民的粮食自给，具有特殊意义的教导，掀起了一个以粮食生产为中心的农业生产高潮。
    积极开垦荒地　大力兴修水利
    早在去年合作社成立以后，广大社员把冬闲变成了冬忙，积极开荒、筑梯田、兴水利、修公路。普克区农民在合作化后不到一年的时间里，开垦的新荒地就等于合作化前十三年所开荒地的总和。迪勃拉区合作化后，开荒速度大大加快，第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）规定的开荒计划预计可提前两年完成。特罗波雅区凯尔纳雅村合作化以后，六户农民自愿到海拔一千五百米的高山上去开荒，建立新的居民点。在水利方面，许多合作社除派义务工，参加国家投资兴修的一些大型水利工程外，还自力更生地兴修了许多小型水库、水渠和水池。
    今年一开春，山区新成立的农业社更加呈现出一片春早人勤的新气象。社员们在拆除了标志着小农经济的田界和篱笆的田地上劳动，显得格外欢跃。今年春播面积普遍比去年扩大。许多农业社都制订了具体措施，争取在最近几年内，做到粮食自给。迪勃拉区的农民提出，要力争在明年就做到粮食自给。
    社员觉悟普遍提高　新人新事不断涌现
    通过合作化运动，广大社员之间的关系大大改变了。解放前迪勃拉区杰昂贝巴伊村和列克比巴伊村为了河水灌溉，世代存在纠葛。合作化后，这两个村的农民联合起来开渠灌溉，变得非常和睦了。
    通过合作化运动，党组织吸收了一批在运动中涌现出来的有觉悟的农民入党；在过去没有党组织的村子里开始建立党的组织；培养和选拔了一批合作社领导干部。各级党组织还注意培养妇女担任合作社的领导工作。新农业社的干部们积极参加劳动，这更加强了干部同群众的联系，鼓舞了社员生产的积极性。
    在山区合作化的过程中，一批优秀工人、劳动党员和机关干部积极响应党关于“农业是全民的事业”和“加强工农联盟”的战斗号召，到山区帮助搞合作化。普克区富夏—阿勒斯森林开发公司有一百名工人党员到新农业社长期落户；卢比克炼钢厂以副厂长纳德雷卡为首的二十九名党员干部到新农业社参加了工作。
    为了支援新农业社的生产，阿尔巴尼亚人民政权大大扩大用于山区和丘陵地区改良土壤和兴修水利的投资，增建国营拖拉机站，并优先向新农业生产合作社供应化肥、提供良种和大量的农药、建筑材料等。（附图片）
