According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the East Asia News Agency reported: Bai Shifan, the chairman of the Japan Liaison Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, sent an open letter to all members of the liaison committee on August 12.

In the open letter, Bai Shifan announced the dissolution of the Japan Liaison Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference.

The decision to dissolve the liaison committee was made at a committee meeting on July 30, with the agreement of an absolute majority of the committee members.

The progressive committee members led by Bai Shifan believed that to further advance the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary cause, it was necessary to draw a clear line and sever ties with the Japanese Communist Party revisionists and their followers within the liaison committee. They engaged in fierce struggles with the JCP revisionists in twelve consecutive committee meetings, finally overcoming the obstruction of Wada Sei and Shimota Masatsugu, and decided to dissolve the Japan Liaison Committee. At the meeting on July 30, the committee members who stood firm with Bai Shifan and fought for principles included: Nakajima Kenzo, Matsuoka Yoko, Sato Masao, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, and Yoda Yoshitoshi.

Committee members such as Miyake Eiko, Uchiyama Toshio, and Sado Keiko also supported the dissolution.

Wada Sei and Shimota Masatsugu strongly opposed the dissolution at this meeting and published a so-called "statement" in the August 5 issue of the *Akahata* newspaper, claiming that the dissolution was "invalid."

Bai Shifan's open letter pointed out that Wada and Shimota, under the banner of "unity and solidarity," obstructed the progress of the cause. The open letter said, "Now is the time for us Afro-Asian writers to make a firm decision: to fight together for the liberation and freedom of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!"

Bai Shifan's open letter said that at present, progressive Japanese writers who insist on anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism are preparing to form a fighting writers' organization.

    白石凡宣布解散亚非作家会议日本联络委员会
    坚决同日共修正主义分子决裂
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：亚非作家会议日本联络委员会委员长白石凡，八月十二日向联络委员会全体会员发出一封公开信。
    白石凡在公开信中宣布解散亚非作家会议日本联络委员会。
    关于解散联络委员会的决定，是在七月三十日的委员会会议上由绝对多数的委员同意作出的。
    以白石凡为首的亚非作家会议日本联络委员会中进步的委员们认为，为了进一步推进反帝反修的革命事业，应当同联络委员会内部的日共修正主义分子及其追随者划清界限，断绝关系。他们在连续召开的十二次委员会会议上同日共修正主义分子进行了激烈的斗争，终于排除了洼田精、霜多正次的阻挠，决定解散日本联络委员会。在七月三十日的会议上和白石凡等一起坚持原则斗争的委员有：中岛健藏、松冈洋子、佐藤正雄、坂本德松、依田义贤等。
    委员中三宅艳子、内山敏、佐多科子等人也赞成解散。
    洼田精、霜多正次在这次会上极力反对解散，并在八月五日的《赤旗报》上发表所谓“声明”，说什么“解散无效”。
    白石凡的公开信指出，洼田、霜多两人打着“团结和统一”的招牌，阻碍事业的前进。公开信说，现在我们亚非作家已经到了这样的时候：必须下定决心，为了亚非拉各国人民的解放和自由而共同战斗！
    白石凡的公开信说，目前，坚持反帝反修的日本进步作家们，正在为组成一个战斗的作家组织进行准备工作。
