    Flue-cured tobacco production in Xuchang, Henan has seen a significant increase. Across the region, 760,000 mu of early and late tobacco plants are tall with large leaves, growing vigorously, presenting a scene of abundant harvest. Currently, the early tobacco harvesting is basically complete, and late tobacco harvesting has begun. It is estimated that the total production and yield per unit area will reach the highest levels in the history of Xuchang's flue-cured tobacco. This is a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the tobacco-growing areas, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have held high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Henan who promoted the "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package," attempting to restore capitalism. They have thoroughly eliminated the poisonous influence of their material incentives in tobacco production. Under the impetus of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres has been greatly inspired, and their enthusiasm for production has been fully mobilized. They have made up their minds to overcome all difficulties, conquered drought and pests, and achieved a bumper harvest of tobacco leaves.

    During the tobacco leaf harvesting process, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," have created new techniques for curing tobacco, ensuring the quality of flue-cured tobacco.

    河南许昌专区烤烟大增产
    河南许昌专区烤烟获得了大增产。全区七十六万亩早晚烟棵高叶大，生长茂盛，呈现一片丰收景象。目前，早烟收炕基本结束，晚烟开始收炕，预计总产量和单位面积产量可达到许昌烤烟史上最高水平。这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
    今年以来，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的烟区广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，愤怒揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南的代理人大肆推行“四大自由”、“三自一包”，复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，彻底肃清他们在烟叶生产上大搞物质刺激的流毒。在文化大革命的推动下，广大贫下中农和革命干部的革命精神大振，发挥了生产积极性，他们下定决心，排除万难，战胜了干旱和虫害，夺取了烟叶大丰收。
    在烟叶收炕过程中，广大贫下中农和革命群众遵照毛主席
  “有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，创造了炕烟新技术，保证了烤烟质量。　（据新华社）
