Nationalist fighters in occupied South Yemen launched extensive armed attacks in Aden on August 11 and 12 against British colonial rulers, protesting against the new conspiracy hatched by the United States and Britain to undermine South Yemen.

In Aden, South Yemen nationalists in the districts of Sheikh Osman, Mansura, Ma'ala, and Tawahi attacked British colonial soldiers and police. According to the British Reuters news agency, which reported reduced figures, in these two days, the nationalists used mortars, rocket launchers, grenades, and small arms to attack British colonial soldiers and military installations at least 200 times. Reports also indicated that the British air force base at Khormaksar was hit by seven mortar shells, the headquarters of the British colonial paratroopers' first battalion was hit by ten mortar shells, and a checkpoint was hit by three mortar shells.

In the days prior, South Yemen nationalists had also used mortars to attack British colonial military airfields and observation posts, and grenades to attack British colonial patrols.

The armed attacks launched by the people of South Yemen were in response to the "United Nations delegation" holding talks in Geneva with the puppet government of the "Federation of South Arabia" on the issue of South Yemen.

Faced with the escalating anti-imperialist struggle of the South Yemen people, British imperialism, in collusion with American imperialism, attempted to use the United Nations to suppress the South Yemen people's struggle for national liberation. In early April, the United States and Britain dispatched a "United Nations delegation" to Aden to interfere in the anti-imperialist struggle of the occupied South Yemen people. However, as soon as this "delegation" set foot on South Yemen soil, it was expelled by the people of South Yemen.

The declining British imperialism sought help from American imperialism, attempting to rely on the United Nations, an instrument of American aggression, to strangle the anti-imperialist struggle of the South Yemen people. This, however, exposed Britain's weakness and its fear of the growing strength of the South Yemen people. Meanwhile, American imperialism agreed to send the "United Nations delegation" to support Britain, aiming to use the United Nations as a cover to further infiltrate South Yemen and to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the local people to protect its oil interests in the Arabian Peninsula.

According to a report from Cairo by Xinhua News Agency, in occupied South Yemen, Arab nationalists recently launched continuous attacks on British colonial authorities in Aden and the British-backed "Federation of South Arabia," achieving resounding victories.

On August 14, nationalists launched a fierce attack on the palace of the Sultan of Lahij in northwest Aden, forcing the reactionary ruler to flee. The nationalists stormed the prisons set up by these reactionary rulers, releasing all the prisoners, and burned the courts and the archives of the imprisoned.

On the same day, other Arab nationalists rose up against the puppet regime of the Dathina Sultanate, 50 kilometers west of Aden, forcing the reactionary Sultan Abdul bin Shay to resign. The nationalists also released all the prisoners in the Sultanate's prisons.

Reports indicated that Arab nationalists had taken control of large areas of the Sultanates of Zara, Mafraishi, and Shab, which belong to the "Federation of South Arabia." The puppet ruler of the Mafraishi Sultanate had been arrested by the rebellious people.

Nationalists also attacked British troops in the Mansura district of Aden and distributed leaflets denouncing British colonial rule over South Yemen.

    炮轰英军基地　打击英国殖民军警　攻打反动统治者宫殿
    南也门民族主义者广泛出击取得胜利
    据新华社讯　被占领的南也门民族主义者十一日和十二日在亚丁向英殖民统治者展开了广泛的武装袭击活动，抗议美英勾结策划对南也门的新阴谋。
    南也门民族主义者在亚丁的舍赫奥斯曼、曼苏拉、马阿拉、塔瓦希等地区，都对英国殖民军警进行了袭击。仅据英国路透社报道的缩小了的数字，在这两天中，民族主义者用迫击炮、火箭筒、手榴弹和小型武器对英国殖民军警和军事设施最少进行了二百次袭击。另据报道，科马克萨英国空军基地的飞机场挨了七发迫击炮弹，英国殖民军伞兵团第一营的作战总部挨了十发迫击炮弹，一个检查站挨了三发迫击炮弹。
    在这前几天，南也门民族主义者还用迫击炮袭击了英殖民军机场和观测所，用手榴弹袭击了英殖民军巡逻队。
    南也门人民这次展开武装袭击是为了抗议“联合国代表团”同“南阿拉伯联邦”傀儡政府在日内瓦“会谈”南也门问题。
    在南也门人民反帝斗争日益高涨的形势面前，英帝国主义勾结美帝国主义，妄图利用联合国来扑灭南也门人民争取民族解放的斗争。今年四月初美英勾结派遣了一个“联合国代表团”去亚丁，干涉被占领南也门人民反帝斗争。但是，这个“代表团”刚踏上南也门的土地，就被南也门人民怒逐了出去。
    日薄西山的英帝国主义向美帝国主义求援，为的是企图依仗美帝侵略工具联合国来扼杀南也门人民的反帝斗争，但这恰恰暴露了英国的虚弱和对南也门人民力量日益强大的恐惧；而美帝国主义同意派“联合国代表团”去支持英国，一方面想利用联合国的招牌，把它自己的势力进一步打入南也门，同时想通过扑灭当地人民的革命烈火来保护它在阿拉伯半岛的石油利益。
    据新华社开罗电　据这里的报纸十七日报道，在被占领的南也门，阿拉伯民族主义者最近连续袭击了亚丁的英国殖民当局和英国殖民主义者扶植的“南阿拉伯联邦”，并取得了辉煌的胜利。
    民族主义者十四日猛烈地袭击了亚丁西北的拉赫杰苏丹国统治者的宫殿，那里的反动统治者被迫逃跑。民族主义者冲进这些反动统治者设立的监狱，把关在里面的人全部释放，并放火烧了法庭和被监禁的人的档案。
    同一天，另一些阿拉伯民族主义者起来造了亚丁以西五十公里的达西纳酋长国傀儡政权的反，迫使反动的酋长阿卜杜勒·本·沙耶辞职。民族主义者还释放了酋长国监狱的全部犯人。
    据报道，阿拉伯民族主义者已控制了扎拉、马弗拉希和沙伊卜等属于“南阿拉伯联邦”的酋长国的大片地区。马弗拉希酋长国的傀儡统治者已被起义人民逮捕。
    民族主义者还在亚丁的曼苏拉地区袭击了英国军队，并散发传单，谴责英国对南也门的殖民统治。
