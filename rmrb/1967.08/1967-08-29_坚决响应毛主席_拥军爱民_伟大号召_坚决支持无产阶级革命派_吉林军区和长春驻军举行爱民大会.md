The Jilin Military Region and the troops stationed in Changchun held a rally to love the people.

Representatives from revolutionary mass organizations such as the Red Revolutionary Alliance, the Second Headquarters, the Changchun Commune, and the East is Red Commune expressed at the meeting that they would definitely become models in supporting the army.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 28 - The leadership of the Jilin Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Changchun held a grand rally to love the people on August 25, expressing their resolute response to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," launching a new wave of loving the people; uniting with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fighting together, and achieving victory together, to achieve new feats in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives from revolutionary mass organizations such as the "Red Revolutionary Alliance," the "Second Headquarters," the "Changchun Commune," and the "East is Red Commune" attended the meeting.

Responsible officials from the Jilin Military Region and the troops stationed in Changchun, including He Youfa, Wang Yang, Ma Ning, Du Hailin, and Jia Bo, attended the meeting. The meeting began with the majestic song "The East is Red." The broad masses of soldiers and revolutionary fighters, with boundless faith in the great leader Chairman Mao, held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and loudly read: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The army must blend with the masses so that the army is seen by the masses as their own army, and this army will be invincible in the world."

The atmosphere in the venue was enthusiastic, and the revolutionary spirit was high. The chorus was resounding, and the slogans "Maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army loving the people," "Learn humbly from the masses," "Firmly support the leftist masses," and "Long live the unity of the army and the people" echoed, fully expressing the broad masses of soldiers' firm determination to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" and to launch a new wave of loving the people.

Responsible officials from the Jilin Military Region and the troops stationed in Changchun, including He Youfa, Du Hailin, and Jia Bo, spoke at the meeting. They said that since the Jilin Military Region and the troops stationed in Changchun intervened in the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the strong support and active help of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, and through the efforts of the broad cadres and soldiers, they have achieved certain results in the "three supports, two militaries" work. This is the result of the unity of the army and the people, fighting together, and is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. However, because we did not hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we could not correctly treat the masses, and in the work of supporting the left, we committed directional and line errors. Recently, the Jilin Military Region and the Changchun garrison party committee, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "summarize achievements, correct errors, and prepare for future battles," have examined the errors. We must closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow the Party Central Committee, closely follow the Central Military Commission, closely follow the Central Cultural Revolution Group, with an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, an unyielding loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, deeply recognize the errors, thoroughly correct the errors, and sincerely hope that the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses will supervise and help us correct the errors.

They said in their speeches that we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," further deepen the activities of loving the people, and strengthen the unity of the army and the people. We must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, honestly be the little students of the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses, humbly listen to their opinions and criticisms. Together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, in the sharp and complex class struggle, we will study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new feats for the people.

They firmly stated in their speeches: We must, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Jilin Province, such as Zhao Lin, and other big and small black henchmen, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically, criticize them deeply, thoroughly, overthrow them, and expose them, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Together with the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, correctly handle the contradictions among the people, strengthen the unity among various revolutionary mass organizations, resolutely stop armed struggles, promote revolutionary great alliances, and lay a solid foundation for achieving the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution in Jilin Province. At the same time, we hope that the broad revolutionary masses will enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and "be thrifty and make revolution," vigorously grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," become models in supporting the army, truly achieve a heart-to-heart connection with the People's Liberation Army, unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and achieve victory together, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province even better.

A grand parade was held after the meeting.

    他们在讲话中坚决表示：一定要和无产阶级革命派一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举革命大批判的旗帜，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们在吉林省的代理人赵林及其它大大小小的黑爪牙，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众团结一致，正确处理人民内部矛盾，加强各革命群众组织之间的团结，坚决制止武斗，搞好革命大联合，为实现吉林省革命的“三结合”奠定坚实的基础。同时希望广大革命群众，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    各革命群众组织的代表分别在大会上讲了话。他们一致表示，坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，做拥军的模范，真正做到和人民解放军心连心，同人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把吉林省的无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
