The core of the great proletarian alliance is formed in the struggle of the masses. Resolutely implementing the broadest revolutionary alliance with the leftists as the core is an important guarantee for the victory of the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. It is an important condition for carrying out a thorough criticism from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives of the Chinese Khrushchev. The experiences of the Cultural Revolution in various places fully prove this.

The broadest revolutionary alliance must have a core. This core is the steadfast proletarian revolutionaries who have stood the test of revolutionary struggle and can always grasp the general direction of the revolutionary struggle.

Currently, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, in the process of seizing power or after seizing power, adopt an attitude of exclusion and opposition towards revolutionary organizations that have fought side by side with them. They put forward the so-called slogan of "me as the core" for achieving the great proletarian alliance. This slogan is completely wrong.

The core of the great proletarian alliance is not self-appointed but is naturally formed in the class struggle. Whether it is this revolutionary mass organization or that revolutionary mass organization, whether it is this person in the revolutionary organization or that person in the revolutionary organization, whoever firmly holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, most resolutely implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correctly executes the various policies formulated by Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and is good at uniting various revolutionary mass organizations and the broad masses, will be recognized by the masses and become the core of the great proletarian alliance.

Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations appoint themselves or their small groups as the "undisputed" and "natural" "core." In the great alliance, they want to "me as the core," regarding other revolutionary mass organizations that have stood the test of struggle as "objects of alliance," and even wanting to suppress and crush brother organizations. This is an expression of individualism. This is an expression of factionalism and cliquism. This goes against the great proletarian alliance and is against the interests of the proletariat. The more they do this, the less they can become the core, and the more they will detach themselves from the broad masses and the masses of their own organization. We hope these comrades will correct their mistakes, abandon the wrong slogan of "me as the core," and hold high the banner of the great proletarian alliance taught by our great leader Chairman Mao.

We must be highly vigilant against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party using the contradictions between revolutionary mass organizations to carry out sabotage. Whatever slogans we put forward, we must seriously consider whether they conform to the interests of the proletariat and not go against the interests of the proletariat. All proletarian revolutionaries must put the overall situation first, correctly handle contradictions among the people, and always direct the spearhead of struggle at the enemies of the proletariat. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, promote, achieve, and consolidate the great proletarian alliance, establish and consolidate the new order of the Cultural Revolution, and push the great proletarian criticism to new heights.

### 革命大联合的核心是在群众斗争中形成的

    革命大联合的核心是在群众斗争中形成的
    坚决实行以左派为核心的最广泛的革命的大联合，这是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争取得胜利的重要保证，是从政治上、思想上、理论上对中国赫鲁晓夫进行大批判的重要条件。各地无产阶级文化大革命的经验，充分证明了这一点。
    最广泛的革命的大联合，要有一个核心。这个核心，就是经受了革命斗争考验、能够始终掌握革命斗争大方向的坚定的无产阶级革命派。
    目前，有少数革命群众组织的负责人，在夺权斗争过程中或在夺权以后，对曾经同自己并肩战斗的革命组织，采取排斥和对立的态度，他们对实现革命大联合，提出了所谓“以我为核心”的口号。这种口号，是完全错误的。
    革命大联合的核心，不是自封的，而是在阶级斗争中自然而然地形成的。不管是这个革命群众组织，还是那个革命群众组织，不管是这个革命组织中的人，还是那个革命组织中的人，谁高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确地执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部制订的各项政策，善于团结各个革命群众组织，最广泛地团结广大群众，谁就会得到群众的公认，成为革命大联合的核心。
    少数革命群众组织的负责人，把自己或自己的小团体自封为“当之无愧”的、当然的“核心”。在大联合中，他们要“以我为核心”，把其它经过斗争考验的革命群众组织都看成是“联合对象”，甚至要把兄弟组织压倒、压垮。这是个人主义的表现。这是山头主义、小团体主义的表现。这是违背革命大联合的，是违背无产阶级利益的。越是这样做，越不能成为核心，越要脱离广大群众，脱离自己所在的那个组织的群众。我们希望这些同志改正错误，抛弃“以我为核心”这个错误口号，高举我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的革命大联合的旗帜。
    我们要高度警惕党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利用革命群众组织之间的矛盾，进行破坏。我们无论提出什么口号，都必须严肃地考虑到要符合无产阶级的利益，而不是违背无产阶级的利益。所有的无产阶级革命派，都要以大局为重，正确处理人民内部矛盾，时刻把斗争矛头指向无产阶级的敌人。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破私立公，促进、实现和巩固革命的大联合，建立和巩固无产阶级文化大革命的新秩序，把革命的大批判推向新高潮。
