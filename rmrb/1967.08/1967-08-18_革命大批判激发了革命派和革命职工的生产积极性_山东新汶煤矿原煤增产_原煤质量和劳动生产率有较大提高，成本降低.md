The revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary workers of the Shandong Xinfu Coal Mine have raised high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, closely combined the struggle, criticism, and reform with the conditions of their unit, and launched a mass criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. This has greatly promoted production. In the first half of this year, the original coal production exceeded the state plan, increasing by 7.8 percent compared to the same period last year; the tunneling plan was also exceeded, and the quality of the original coal and labor productivity have both significantly improved, while the cost has been reduced below the planned level.

The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of this coal mine organized old workers and revolutionary leading cadres to compare the old and new societies during the revolutionary criticism, using their personal experiences to refute the fallacies spread by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, such as "exploitation is beneficial." The deputy section chief of the Yucun Mine tunneling area, Hou Guangjian, who is a worker by origin, recalled the bitter life of being exploited and oppressed in the past, and denounced the absurdities that cover up capitalism, saying: "Chairman Mao saved me from the bitter sea. China's Khrushchev wants the capitalists to ride on our heads again, exploit us, and oppress us, making us suffer twice. This is absolutely impossible, a million times impossible!"

The revolutionary criticism has greatly aroused the deep hatred of the proletarian revolutionary faction towards the class enemy. They unanimously declared that they would resolutely use the actual work of improving production to counter the conspiracy of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party to sabotage production and restore capitalism. In early June, the capitalist-roaders in the Party of the Liangzhuang Mine incited some deceived masses to start three fights, attempting to disrupt production. The proletarian revolutionary faction saw through their plot, firmly remembering Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," and firmly held their production posts, insisting on production. As soon as the whistle blew for work, it was like receiving a battle command. They lined up and sang the song of the quotation "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory," and entered the production battle with high spirits. The backfilling area of this mine had two working faces replaced in June, with a broken top plate and poor production conditions. They had been short of production by over 400 tons since mid-month. To make up for the shortfall, they solved several key production problems and adjusted the labor force. The proletarian revolutionary faction also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "unity—criticism—unity" to persuade and educate the deceived masses, uniting them to jointly grasp the revolution and improve production. By the end of June, they were producing daily, and by the end of the month, they not only made up for the shortfall but also produced an additional 330 tons.

Many revolutionary cadres of the Xinfu Coal Mine stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively participating in the revolutionary criticism with the broad revolutionary faction, and vigorously promoting "grasp revolution, promote production." Many section chiefs and team leaders in the work areas not only actively participated in the movement but also frequently went to the production sites to work and command. Wherever there were difficulties, they went to solve them, and wherever there were key production problems, they went to resolve them, playing a significant role in exceeding the coal production plan. The team leader of the fast-speed thirteenth team of the Xiezhuang Mine, during the critical moment of class struggle, was attacked by the deceived masses incited by the capitalist-roaders in the Party, but he still insisted on holding production meetings, arranging production, commanding production on time, participating in labor, and ensuring that this team exceeded the production plan in May and June.

The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of this coal mine, during the revolutionary criticism, never forgot Chairman Mao's great call to "save on everything for the revolution," and used every means to reduce the consumption of raw materials. The revolutionary workers of the Sunzhuang Mine launched an activity to save one wedge, one stick, and one pillar, gradually reducing the consumption of pit props. The consumption of gunpowder and electricity was also reduced below the planned level, saving a large amount of national wealth for the state.

    革命大批判激发了革命派和革命职工的生产积极性
    山东新汶煤矿原煤增产
    原煤质量和劳动生产率有较大提高，成本降低
    本报讯　山东新汶煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，高举无产阶级的革命批判旗帜，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开了群众性的大批判、大斗争，大大促进了生产。今年上半年，原煤产量超额完成国家计划，比去年同期提高百分之七点八；掘进计划也超额完成，原煤质量和劳动生产率都有较大的提高，成本比计划降低。
    这个煤矿的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在进行革命的大批判中，组织老工人和革命的领导干部，进行新旧社会对比，以亲身经历驳斥了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派散布的“剥削有功”等谬论。禹村矿掘进区工人出身的副区长侯光俭回忆了过去受剥削受压迫的痛苦生活，痛斥了“剥削有功”等替资本主义涂脂抹粉的一派胡言乱语。他说：“毛主席把我救出了苦海，中国的赫鲁晓夫想让资本家再来骑在我们头上，剥削我们，压迫我们，叫我们再受二茬罪，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！”
    革命的大批判，大大激发了无产阶级革命派对阶级敌人的深仇大恨。他们一致表示，决心用搞好生产的实际行动，回击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏生产、复辟资本主义的阴谋。今年六月上旬，良庄矿党内走资本主义道路当权派挑动一些受蒙蔽的群众三次挑起武斗，企图破坏生产。无产阶级革命派识破了他们的阴谋，牢牢记住毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，坚守生产岗位，坚持生产。上班的气笛一响，就象听到战斗的命令，他们站好队，高唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”语录歌，斗志昂扬地投入生产战斗。这个矿回采一区，六月份有两个工作面新旧交替，顶板破碎，生产条件不好，从中旬就欠产四百余吨。他们为了补上欠产，先后解决了一些生产关键问题，调整了劳动力。无产阶级革命派还按照毛主席“团结——批评——团结”的教导，去说服教育受蒙蔽的群众，团结他们共同抓好革命，搞好生产。这样，到六月下旬，他们就日日超产，全月不仅补上了欠产，而且超产三百三十吨。
    新汶煤矿不少的革命干部，站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和广大革命派一起积极投入革命的大批判，同时大力“抓革命，促生产”。许多工区的区长、队长，既积极参加运动，又经常深入生产现场劳动和指挥，哪里有困难，就到哪里去，哪里有生产关键问题，就到哪里去解决，在超额完成煤炭生产计划中起了很大作用。协庄矿快速十三队的队长在阶级斗争的尖锐时刻，遭到党内走资本主义道路当权派挑动受蒙蔽群众的围攻，但他仍然坚持召开生产会议，研究布置生产，按时跟班指挥生产，参加劳动，保证了这个队五月份和六月份都超额完成生产计划。
    这个煤矿的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在革命的大批判中念念不忘毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，千方百计降低原材料消耗。孙村矿的革命职工开展了节约一个木楔、一根木棒、一棵点柱的活动，坑木消耗逐月下降，火药和电力消耗，也都分别比计划降低了，为国家节约了大量财富。
