The Albanian "People's Voice" Hails the Great Victory of China's Cultural Revolution in Its First Year

The Chinese People Are Thoroughly Smashing the Headquarters of the Bourgeoisie

Comrade Lin Biao's Recent Call to the PLA Further Promotes the Development of the Cultural Revolution

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana on the 17th, the Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 16th titled "The Great March Forward of China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The editorial enthusiastically hailed the great victories achieved by China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year.

The editorial said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been successfully concluded for a year. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" marked a historic turning point in the victorious advance of China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution, giving a new and powerful impetus to the revolutionary torrent of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and Red Guards. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the hundreds of millions of people of great China have risen up to smash and thoroughly destroy the headquarters of the bourgeoisie politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to ensure that the Party and the state do not change color, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the victory of socialism.

Over the past year, the flames of China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution have swept across the country, strengthening the political and ideological positions of the proletariat and greatly consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the socialist economy, in industry, agriculture, culture, and national defense, new victories have been achieved. Over the past year, the counter-revolutionary faces of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have been further exposed to the broad masses of the people. The revisionists have been dealt a heavy blow, and their reactionary fortresses have been seized one by one by the proletariat. China's Khrushchev and his running dogs, such as Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, and Peng Dehuai, have been dragged out.

The editorial pointed out that at present, China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The great alliance of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" are proceeding victoriously, and the revolutionary masses are thoroughly defeating the class enemies. Revolutionary committees, which are temporary power organs, are being established in various places in China. The establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another great victory for the revolutionary line of the leader of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial said that Comrade Lin Biao's call to the entire army and all cadres and soldiers to "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" has further promoted the development of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The editorial pointed out that the victorious advance of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a fatal blow to the internal and external enemies of the Chinese people.

The editorial said that over the past year, China's productive forces have developed unprecedentedly. Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" has been supported by hundreds of millions of Chinese people and has become a great mobilizing force.

The editorial said that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is achieving victories on all fronts. However, the enemies do not willingly accept their defeat; they do not want to leave the historical stage and are still trying every means to plot and attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration in China. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are vigilant against the despicable plots and cunning tricks of the class enemies. They always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the last. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance."

The editorial pointed out that the recent more frantic anti-China clamor by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries is not accidental. This precisely shows that they are terrified of the victorious advance of China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary power organs established on the basis of the "three-in-one combination," and the great unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and guided by the red banner of Chairman Mao's Marxism-Leninism thought, are making the hopes of the imperialists and revisionists to destroy the dictatorship of the proletariat and to carry out the Soviet, Yugoslav, and other countries' schemes in China completely bankrupt.

The editorial said that the victorious development of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired and encouraged the people of various countries who are struggling for national liberation and against imperialism, revisionism, and reaction. China has further strengthened its active support for the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation. The Chinese people are fulfilling the principles of proletarian internationalism without reservation. The Chinese people are a powerful backing for the Vietnamese people.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labor have stood and will stand with the Marxist-Leninist and the indestructible fortress of world communism—the fraternal Chinese people. The Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labor wholeheartedly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has great historical significance not only for the socialist destiny of China but also for the socialist and revolutionary destiny of the whole world.

    阿《人民之声报》欢呼我国文化大革命一年来的伟大胜利
    中国人民正在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
    林彪同志最近向全军指战员发出的号召进一步推动了文化大革命的发展
    据新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十六日发表题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命在胜利前进》的编辑部文章，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命一年多来所取得的伟大胜利。
    文章说，中国共产党八届十一中全会胜利闭幕已经一年了。在毛泽东同志主持下制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，标志着中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的历史性转折，给了亿万工农兵和红卫兵群众的革命浪潮以新的、有力的推动。伟大的人民中国的亿万群众，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，奋起从政治上、思想上和理论上彻底粉碎和摧毁资产阶级司令部，使中国的党和国家不改变颜色，巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义的胜利。
    一年来，中国无产阶级文化大革命的烈火燃遍了全国，加强了无产阶级的政治、思想阵地，大大地巩固了无产阶级专政。在社会主义经济领域中、在工农业、文化和国防方面，取得了新的胜利。一年来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反革命嘴脸，在广大人民群众面前已被进一步揭露。修正主义分子受到了迎头痛击，他们的反动堡垒被无产阶级逐个攻破和夺取。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其走狗彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、彭德怀之流被揪了出来。
    文章指出，目前，中国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”正在胜利地进行，无产阶级革命派正在彻底打倒阶级敌人。在中国各地正在建立临时权力机构——革命委员会。青海省革命委员会的成立是中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志的革命路线的又一重大胜利。
    文章说，林彪同志向全军指战员发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”的号召，进一步推动了无产阶级文化大革命的发展。
    文章指出，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进是对中国人民的内外敌人的致命打击。
    文章说，一年来，中国的生产力得到空前的发展。毛泽东主席的“抓革命，促生产”的号召得到亿万中国群众的拥护，成为巨大的动员力量。
    文章说，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线正在各个战线上取得胜利。但是，敌人并不甘心自己的失败，他们是不愿退出历史舞台的，他们还在千方百计地玩弄阴谋，企图在中国实现反革命复辟。亿万革命群众警惕着阶级敌人的无耻阴谋和狡猾伎俩。他们永远记着毛泽东主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    文章指出，帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派最近更加疯狂地进行反华叫嚣绝不是偶然的。这正表明他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进怕得要死。在“三结合”基础上建立起来的革命政权机构，以及在中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义思想红旗指引下的中国人民的伟大团结，正在使帝国主义和修正主义企图摧毁无产阶级专政、在中国搞苏联、南斯拉夫等国家的那一套东西的希望彻底破产。
    文章说，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展激励和鼓舞着为争取民族解放、反对帝修反而斗争的各国人民。中国更加加强了对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英勇的越南人民的积极支持。中国人民毫无保留地履行无产阶级国际主义原则，中国人民是越南人民的强大后盾。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党过去和现在都同马克思列宁主义和世界共产主义不可摧毁的堡垒——兄弟的中国站在一起。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党衷心支持不仅对中国的社会主义命运，而且对全世界的社会主义和革命命运具有重大历史意义的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
