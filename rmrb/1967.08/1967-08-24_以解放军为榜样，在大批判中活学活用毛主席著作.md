In the midst of the nationwide wave of revolutionary criticism to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and the high tide of "supporting the army and loving the people," over ten thousand revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Beijing held a grand mobilization meeting to learn from the PLA and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great criticism. The participants firmly declared: Hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," always believe in the PLA, always rely on the PLA, and always learn from the PLA; hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and in the great criticism, learn from the PLA to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve new levels in learning and applying, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, turning Beijing into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The stage was adorned with a giant portrait of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao. On either side, red banners read: "Plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout every inch of the capital! Establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought!" and "In the great criticism, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage!" The entire venue resonated with revolutionary songs and the loud recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations: "The army must blend with the people, so that the army is seen by the people as their own army. Such an army is invincible," and "Without a people's army, people have nothing." The atmosphere was filled with the revolutionary spirit of the army loving the people, the people supporting the army, and the close unity between the army and the people.

Representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Beijing Garrison, Kong Xiangxiu, Zhang Jingxue, and Liu Daluan, spoke at the meeting. They vividly shared their personal experiences of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supporting the proletarian revolutionaries, and protecting revolutionary pioneers. They also shared their experiences of consciously carrying out self-criticism and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the intense class struggle, using the struggle between the two lines as the key link. During their speeches, the revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted: "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army! Salute the great People's Liberation Army!" "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!"

Comrade Zhou Jingfang, a standing committee member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, warmly praised the broad officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two lines, firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionaries, and making significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. He called on the proletarian revolutionaries in Beijing to humbly learn from the PLA, and like the PLA, in the great criticism, study, master, and apply Mao Zedong Thought, truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The proletarian revolutionaries should play a model role in this great criticism and great study, achieve new merits and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, continuously learn, summarize experiences, and improve themselves, and stand the test in the great criticism.

Comrade Huang Zuozhen, the second political commissar of the Beijing Garrison, spoke at the meeting. He said: Chairman Lin Biao's latest instruction to "hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest motivation for the entire army. We, the Beijing Garrison troops, will definitely carry it out and follow it strictly. We will definitely hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries, rely on the proletarian revolutionaries, protect the proletarian revolutionaries, and unite and fight together with the proletarian revolutionaries. We will forever be diligent students of the masses, always stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, and heart to heart with the people, carry forward the glorious traditions of our army, forever unite with the people, and maintain the deep affection between the army and the people like fish and water. We will ensure the completion of the glorious tasks of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "three supports and two militaries," and achieve new merits for the people.

"Without a people's army, people have nothing." At the critical moment of the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the Chinese People's Liberation Army most resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionaries, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries. After they seized power, the PLA enthusiastically helped them exercise power correctly, establishing a deep bond of combat friendship between the army and the people. Currently, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the help of the PLA, the proletarian revolutionaries in Beijing are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and in the great criticism movement, the entire city has seen a new high tide of the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Attending today's meeting were also standing committee members of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and responsible comrades from the workers' congress, peasants' congress, red guards' congress of higher education institutions, and red guards' congress of middle schools.

    永远相信解放军　永远依靠解放军　永远向解放军学习
    以解放军为榜样，在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作
    首都无产阶级革命派万余人隆重举行动员大会。大会表示要高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，高举革命的批判大旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更高的新阶段，把北京办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新华社二十三日讯　在亿万革命人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的高潮中，在全国蓬勃开展“拥军爱民”的高潮中，北京市无产阶级革命派万余人，今天隆重举行学习解放军，在革命的大批判中活学活用毛主席著作动员大会。参加大会的无产阶级革命派坚决表示：高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，永远相信解放军，永远依靠解放军，永远向解放军学习；高举革命的批判大旗，在革命的大批判中，象解放军那样，活学活用毛主席著作，学出新水平，用出新水平，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更高的新阶段，把北京办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    大会主席台上高悬伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的巨幅画像，两旁红色大字横标上写着：“把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都的每一寸土地！树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威！”“在革命的大批判中，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段！”全场高唱革命歌曲，高声朗读毛主席语录：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”全场充满了军爱民，民拥军，军民亲密团结的革命气氛。
    北京卫戍区活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表孔祥秀、章敬学和刘大乱，在大会上讲了话。他们以切身的体会生动地介绍了他们在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，支持无产阶级革命派，爱护革命闯将的生动事迹，并介绍了他们在轰轰烈烈的阶级斗争中，以两条路线斗争为纲，自觉地进行破私立公，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威的体会。在他们讲话时，革命群众不断高呼：“向伟大的中国人民解放军学习！向伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！”“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”
    北京市革命委员会常委周景方在会上热烈赞扬北京卫戍区广大指战员，在两条道路的斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，为首都无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大贡献。他号召北京市的无产阶级革命派一定要虚心地向解放军学习，象解放军那样，在革命的大批判中，学习毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想，应用毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段。无产阶级革命派要在这场大批判、大学习中起模范带头作用，要在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功，建新劳，要不断学习，不断总结经验，不断提高自己，在革命的大批判中经受新的考验。
    北京卫戍区第二政委黄作珍在会上讲了话。他说：林彪副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的最新指示，是对全军的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们北京卫戍部队一定坚决执行，坚决照办。一定高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，依靠无产阶级革命派，保卫无产阶级革命派，和无产阶级革命派紧紧团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。永远勤勤恳恳地当群众的小学生，时时刻刻和人民群众肩并肩，手携手，心连心，发扬我军的光荣传统，永远和人民群众团结在一起，永远保持和人民群众鱼水般的深厚感情，保证更好地完成保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，为人民立新功。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”。首都无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的关键时刻，中国人民解放军最坚决地支持他们，大长了无产阶级革命派的威风。在他们夺权以后，解放军又热情地帮他们掌好权、用好权，军民之间建立了血肉相连的战斗友情。当前，北京市的无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想的指引下，在解放军的帮助下，正高举革命的批判的旗帜，向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部猛烈开火，在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动中，全市出现了一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的新高潮。
    出席今天大会的还有北京市革命委员会常委和工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中学红代会的负责人。
