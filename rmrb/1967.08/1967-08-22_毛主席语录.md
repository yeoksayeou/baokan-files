If they want to fight, we will annihilate them completely. That's how it is. They come to attack, and we annihilate them. They will feel better that way. Annihilate a little, feel a little better; annihilate more, feel more better; annihilate completely, feel completely better.

    毛主席语录
    如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。
