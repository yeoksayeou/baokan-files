	Further Direct Secret Political Dealings with the West
	Soviet Revisionists and British Imperialists Establish "Hotline"

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in London, the Soviet revisionists and British imperialists, in order to facilitate direct secret political dealings, signed an agreement on the 25th in London to establish a direct "hotline."

	It is reported that this is the third "hotline" established between the Soviet revisionist leadership and Western imperialist countries. The first "hotline" was established in June 1963 between the Kremlin and the White House. Recently, during the period when the American and British imperialist lackeys of Israel launched an aggressive war against the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin and the American imperialist leader Johnson had used this "hotline" multiple times to discuss the Middle East issue over the phone, conspiring to betray the Arab people's revolutionary cause. The second "hotline" was established this June between Moscow and Paris.

	Similar to the previous two "hotlines," the "hotline" between the Kremlin and the British Prime Minister's office is also a mutual connection of teletype machines, and can be used for oral communication at any time.

	The Soviet revisionists chose to establish a "hotline" with Britain less than 24 hours after jointly proposing the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft with the United States, indicating that the Soviet revisionists have decided to collude with the West on a broader scale.

    进一步同西方进行直接秘密政治交易
    苏修同英帝建立“热线”
    据新华社伦敦电　苏修和英帝国主义为了便于进行直接的秘密政治交易，于二十五日在伦敦签署了一项安设直通“热线”的协定。
    据报道，这是苏修领导集团同西方帝国主义国家建立的第三条“热线”。第一条“热线”是一九六三年六月苏联和美国在克里姆林宫和白宫之间建立的。不久前，在美、英帝国主义走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争期间，苏修头目柯西金和美帝国主义头子约翰逊曾经多次使用这条“热线”就中东问题进行通话，策划出卖阿拉伯人民的反革命勾当。第二条“热线”是今年六月在莫斯科和巴黎之间建立的。
    同前两条“热线”一样，克里姆林宫同英国首相府之间的“热线”也是两边互通的电传打字机的联系，并且随时可以口头联系。
    苏修选择在同美帝一起提出“防止核扩散”条约草案不到二十四小时内同英国建立“热线”，表明苏修决定要在比较广泛的范围内同西方勾结。
