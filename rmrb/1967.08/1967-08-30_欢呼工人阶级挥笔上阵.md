	Hail the Working Class Taking Up the Pen

	“Millions of trees in frost are red and brilliant, the heavenly troops' anger surges to the heavens.” A thorough criticism and denunciation movement to smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev is sweeping the nation. This unprecedented large-scale revolutionary criticism and denunciation is the key link in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most important task at hand, and the crucial point for consolidating the victory of the struggle for power and for holding power well.

	On the eve of the nation's victory, Chairman Mao taught us: “The question now facing the Chinese people is whether to carry the revolution through to the end or to let it peter out halfway. If we are to carry the revolution through to the end, we must use revolutionary methods, and wipe out all counter-revolutionary forces thoroughly, completely, and resolutely.” Just like all reactionaries in history, China's Khrushchev is unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history voluntarily. He is still putting up a desperate resistance. We must mobilize hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to swear to criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev thoroughly and deeply in politics, ideology, and theory, to overthrow and expose him, and to win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The broad masses of workers are one of the main forces in this revolutionary criticism and denunciation movement. They have the deepest experience of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads since liberation. They have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao. They have the most authority to refute China's Khrushchev's various fallacies about developing and restoring capitalism. After they have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, they can be invincible and conquer all. In the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, they take up arms, everyone speaks out and takes action, picks up the pen as a sword, and turns the workshop into a battlefield for criticism and denunciation. They have fought brilliantly and achieved a high level. Their articles and big-character posters for criticism and denunciation are sharp and vigorous, with a clear class stand, and a strong fighting atmosphere. The facts have proved that the broad masses of workers are the most outstanding revolutionary critics. In the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, only by fully mobilizing and relying on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres to fight, can we thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by China's Khrushchev and smash his plot to restore capitalism!

     欢呼工人阶级挥笔上阵
    “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉”。一场彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的革命大批判运动，正在全国轰轰烈烈地展开。这场空前规模的革命大批判，是当前无产阶级文化大革命的中心环节，是当前头等重要的大事，是巩固夺权斗争胜利和掌好权的关键。
    毛主席在全国胜利前夕曾教导我们说：现在摆在中国人民面前的问题“是将革命进行到底呢，还是使革命半途而废呢？如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”。中国的赫鲁晓夫和历史上的一切反动派一样，是不甘心自动退出历史舞台的，他还在负隅顽抗。“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，我们一定要发动亿万革命群众，誓把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，批倒批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    广大的工人群众，是当前这场革命大批判的主力军之一。他们对解放以来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，感受最深，他们对毛主席的感情最浓，对批驳中国赫鲁晓夫的发展资本主义、复辟资本主义的种种谬论，最有发言权。当他们掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器以后，就能战无不胜，攻无不克。在革命的大批判中，他们挥戈上阵，人人动口动手，拿起笔，作刀枪，把车间当成了大批判的战场。他们杀出了威风，批出了水平。他们的批判文章和大字报，尖锐泼辣，阶级立场鲜明，战斗气氛浓厚。事实证明，广大的工人群众是最出色的革命批判家。在革命的大批判中，只有充分发动和依靠广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命干部进行战斗，才能把中国赫鲁晓夫散布的流毒彻底肃清，使他复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底粉碎！
