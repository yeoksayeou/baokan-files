Albanian journalists gathered in Tirana's Culture Palace on August 24 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the "People's Voice" newspaper and Albanian Press Day (August 25).

Alija, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, delivered a speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee. He said, "Our press, past, present, and future, will always be one of the weapons for educating, mobilizing, and organizing the masses to continuously carry out the revolution. It is the beacon that the Party lights for the people to follow the path of socialism and communism. In recent years, especially after the publication of the Party and government's call and the open letter from the Party Central Committee, which marked a nationwide revolutionary upsurge, all our press has undergone a qualitative improvement. Our press, radio stations, and Albanian News Agency, as before, emphasize proletarian politics, carry out class struggle, implement the mass line, and further militarize, becoming a powerful fighting force for our Party in the invincible revolution. Today, our press, radio stations, and news agencies are actively participating in the struggle of the entire Party and people to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress and Comrade Hoxha's teachings on further revolutionizing the Party and power, deeply carrying out the cultural revolution, and realizing the Fourth Five-Year Plan; and, as always, together with all Marxist-Leninist press around the world, are fulfilling the task of fighting against imperialism led by the United States and the modern revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito."

Alija, in discussing the current basic tasks of Albanian press, pointed out that, as the Party and Comrade Hoxha have pointed out, the key to gloriously completing our domestic and international tasks is the continuous revolutionization of the Party, power, and all aspects of our life. Therefore, the task of continuous revolutionization is also put forward for our press. If journalists continuously struggle for their own revolutionization, better establish a communist revolutionary worldview and qualities, think, work, and live with the people as true revolutionaries and servants of the people, and better implement the mass line in all aspects, then they will better complete this task.

Alija said, "Our press and propaganda agencies should continuously learn from Comrade Hoxha's teachings: 'Anyone can write big-character posters without hesitation about their views on work and people.' We should make every effort to turn all our newspapers, radio stations, and news agencies into platforms for the masses. This is also the best guarantee for the continuous revolutionization of the press itself."

Lubonja, the editor-in-chief of the "People's Voice," also spoke at the meeting. He emphasized the significance of Albanian press fighting side by side with Chinese press and other Marxist-Leninist press. He, on behalf of Albanian journalists, assured that in the future, they will better follow the Party and Comrade Hoxha's teachings and strive to complete domestic and international tasks.

Attending the meeting were: members of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour Shytura, Mamaki, Pacrami, Changoli, and Dejana, Chairman of the Albanian Journalists' Association Vogl, and other journalists.

    阿尔巴尼亚新闻工作者集会热烈庆祝阿《人民之声报》创刊二十五周年
    突出无产阶级政治　使报刊成为战斗的武器
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和阿尔巴尼亚新闻工作者协会二十四日在地拉那文化宫举行集会，热烈庆祝《人民之声报》创刊二十五周年和阿尔巴尼亚报刊节（八月二十五日）。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记阿利雅代表党中央向大会致贺词。他说，我国报刊过去、现在和将来都永远是教育、动员和组织群众不断进行革命的武器之一，是党为全国人民照亮社会主义和共产主义道路的明灯。最近几年来，特别是标志着全国空前的革命高潮的党和政府的号召书和党中央的公开信发表以后，我国所有报刊有了质的提高。我国报刊、广播电台和阿尔巴尼亚通讯社象以往一样，突出无产阶级政治、开展阶级斗争，贯彻群众路线，进一步战斗化，成为我党在战无不胜的革命中的强大的战斗队。今天，我国报刊、广播电台和通讯社正在积极投入全党和全国人民为实现党的第五次代表大会的决议和霍查同志关于争取党和政权的进一步革命化的教导，深入开展思想文化大革命，实现第四个五年计划的战斗中；并一如既往地同世界所有马克思列宁主义报刊一起，执行着反对以美国为首的帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫、铁托现代修正主义斗争的任务。
    阿利雅在谈到阿尔巴尼亚报刊当前的基本任务后指出，正象党和霍查同志所指出的，光荣地完成我们的国内和国际任务的关键是党、政权和我国全部生活的不断革命化。因此，也向我国报刊提出了不断革命化的任务。如果新闻工作者不断为自身的革命化而斗争，更好地树立共产主义的革命的世界观和品质，象真正的革命者一样，作为人民的勤务员并同人民在一起思考、工作和生活，更好地在各方面深入贯彻群众路线，那末，他们将更好地完成这一任务。
    阿利雅说，我国报刊、宣传鼓动机构应当不断学习霍查同志的教导：“任何人都可以毫无顾虑地把他对工作，对人们的看法用大字报写出来。”我们应当尽最大可能把我国所有的报刊、广播电台和通讯社变成群众的讲台。这也是报刊本身不断革命化的最好保证。
    《人民之声报》总编辑卢鲍尼亚也在大会上讲了话。他强调阿尔巴尼亚报刊同中国报刊及其他马克思列宁主义报刊一起并肩战斗的意义。他代表阿尔巴尼亚新闻工作者保证，今后将更好地遵循党和霍查同志的教导，为完成国内和国际任务而奋斗。
    参加大会的还有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员什图拉、马马基、帕奇拉米、昌戈利、德雅纳，阿尔巴尼亚新闻工作者协会主席沃格利以及新闻界人士等。
