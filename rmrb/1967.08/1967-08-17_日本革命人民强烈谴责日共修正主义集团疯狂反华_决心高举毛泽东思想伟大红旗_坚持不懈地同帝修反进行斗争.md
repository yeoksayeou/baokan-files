Japanese revolutionary people strongly condemn the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group's frenzied anti-China campaign. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and persistently fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: The East Asia News Agency reports that Japanese progressive friends recently spoke to a reporter from the East Asia News Agency, strongly condemning the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group's renewed frenzied anti-China wave. They emphasized that the Japanese revolutionary people resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and persistently fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Fukioka Kunihiro, Secretary-General of the Japanese Federation of Publishers and Booksellers, pointed out that the anti-China actions of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists are a self-exposure of their counter-revolutionary nature.

Fukioka said, the Japanese revolutionary people are not afraid of any attacks from American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism. They will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and concretely apply this great universal truth to the practice of the Japanese revolution.

Fukioka said, currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is advancing to victory, bringing great encouragement to the Japanese revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. In the current great struggle between revolution and counter-revolution on a global scale, if one deviates from Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggle will inevitably fail.

Forest River Shinobu, who is fighting for the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival, said, "We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings. We will unite with the broad masses of the people and resolutely fight against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism until we achieve the final victory in the liberation struggle."

Tanaka Shujiro, a standing committee member of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, said: "Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, the traitors mixed in the revolutionary ranks are being exposed one by one, which is a good thing and is indispensable for the revolutionary people of various countries and the world revolutionary struggle. Because the Ryoemon revisionist group has been slandering and defaming Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese people have become more aware of who the enemies of the revolution are and who the true friends of the revolution are."

Tanaka emphasized that the Japanese revolutionary people infinitely love Chairman Mao and resolutely support the Chinese people who are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He expressed that in the struggle for the liberation of Japan, they will seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    日本革命人民强烈谴责日共修正主义集团疯狂反华
    决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  坚持不懈地同帝修反进行斗争
    新华社十六日讯　东方通讯社报道：日本进步朋友最近向东方通讯社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责日共修正主义集团再次掀起疯狂的反华浪潮。他们强调指出，日本革命人民坚决高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持不懈地同帝修反进行斗争。
    日本出版工会协议会书记长饭冈邦辅指出，日共修正主义分子的反华行为，是他们的反革命面目的自我暴露。
    饭冈说，日本革命人民，不怕美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义的任何攻击。他们将高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想这个伟大的普遍真理，具体地运用到日本革命的实践中去。
    饭冈说，目前，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，正在胜利前进，给日本的革命人民带来了莫大的鼓舞。毛泽东思想是亚、非、拉各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大的思想武器。在当前全世界范围的革命和反革命的大搏斗中，只要一离开毛泽东思想，革命斗争就必定遭到失败。
    为实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢而斗争的东京青年森川忍说，我们无限忠于毛主席的教导，我们要团结广大人民群众，坚决向美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义进行斗争，直到取得解放斗争的最后胜利。
    日本国际贸易促进协会常务理事田中修二郎说：“在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，混在革命队伍中的叛变分子，一个一个的都暴露出来了，这是一件大好事，对于各国革命人民和世界革命斗争来说，也是必不可少的事情。由于宫本修正主义集团疯狂地谩骂和中伤毛泽东思想，日本人民更加清楚地认识到谁是革命的敌人，谁是革命的真正的朋友。”
    田中强调说，日本革命人民无限热爱毛主席，坚决支持正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民。他表示在争取日本解放的斗争中，要认真地活学活用毛主席著作。
