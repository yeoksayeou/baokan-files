According to a report from the Soviet Union's *Izvestia*, a forestry chief in the Khabarovsk region of the Soviet Union has been stealing public property for a long time, evading punishment, and has become an untouchable "forest king." The story is as follows:

Valentin Lenev, after demobilization from the army, became a driver, driving a small car for the forestry chief of the Petropavlovsk Forestry Bureau, Ivan Simshag. Two months later, because Lenev was unwilling to transport private goods for the chief, he had to "resign according to his own wishes."

As it turns out, Lenev was not the only one. Before him, two other drivers, Drozdov and Kirikilicha, also left the forestry bureau, for the same reason: they were unwilling to participate in illegal activities. According to Kirikilicha, he "knew many strange things." For example, various forest rangers, instead of protecting the forest, were actually catching various fish, caviar, and other animals that are abundant in Khabarovsk. Some of these rangers spent their days cutting firewood from good, dry forests, which was then transported to unknown destinations by others using fire trucks. Kirikilicha often used his car not only to transport fish for the chief but also to transport pig feed and even cucumbers grown in greenhouses.

In Khabarovsk, there are still many remote places. A considerable part of these places are the "territory" of this "forest king." In these places, the role of this economic leader is special. He arbitrarily orders the felling of young trees, the felling of the best trees, and forges business documents; the allocation of work, housing, and material benefits all depend on him.

This "forest king" has been in power for many years. He uses various means to consolidate his power. Between 1964 and 1965, he replaced two-thirds of the staff.

### 林场场长变成了“森林王”

    林场场长变成了“森林王”
    据苏联《消息报》报道，苏联堪察加地区的一个林场场长，长时期盗窃公共财产，逍遥法外，谁也奈何不了他，简直是个“森林王”。事情是这样的：
    瓦连金·利涅夫从军队复员后，当了司机，给彼得罗巴夫罗夫斯克林场场长伊凡·西姆沙格开小汽车，两个月后，因为利涅夫不愿意为场长运私货，就不得不“根据自己的愿望”辞了职。
    原来，利涅夫并不是唯一这样的人。在他之前，还有两个给场长开汽车的司机德罗兹多夫和基里基利查离开了林场，也是因为他们不愿意参与坏勾当。据基里基利查说，他“知道许多离奇的怪事”。比如说，各种各样编制内的护林员并不是去护林，而是去捕获各种鱼、鱼子和在堪察加盛产的其他各种动物。其中一部分护林员整天从干燥的好森林中采伐所谓薪柴，然后再由别人用消防车运到不知去向的地方。基里基利查常常用汽车不仅给场长运鱼，而且运猪饲料，甚至运温室培育出来的黄瓜。
    在堪察加还有不少偏僻的地方。其中有相当一部分是这个“森林王”的“领地”。在这些地方，这个经济领导人的作用是特殊的。他随意命令砍伐幼林，砍伐最好的树，伪造经营文件；分配工作，分配住房和物质福利也都要取决于他。
    这个“森林王”已经统治了许多年。他用各种手段巩固自己的权力。在一九六四年到一九六五年期间，有三分之二的编内工作人员被他撤换了。
