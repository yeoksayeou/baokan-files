The thunder roars with the weight of a thousand jins, and the east wind blows across ten thousand miles. As our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves great victories, the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more widely and penetrating deeper into people's hearts. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the billions of revolutionary masses around the world, has already become an irresistible force driving history forward.

It is precisely under such a great revolutionary situation that the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries have launched a vicious anti-China wave. They curse us with their mouths and fear us in their hearts. Above all, they fear the great Mao Zedong Thought the most. No matter where they are, when the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries hear the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought or see the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they immediately become terrified and panic-stricken. They have tried every means to resist the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, wishing they could drive it off the face of the earth in an instant.

However, it is not easy for an ant to shake a tree. Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible great revolutionary truth, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and the guiding beacon for the people of all countries in their struggle for liberation. The revolutionary people of the world eagerly seek Mao Zedong Thought, love it dearly, and study it hungrily. This is something that no force can stop.

Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the revolutionary people, it will become an immeasurable material force for transforming the world. The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend, propagate, and spread Mao Zedong Thought. How can they not encounter the frenzied opposition and desperate resistance of all counter-revolutionary forces in the world? This is a class struggle. The intensity of this class struggle precisely reflects the immense power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the desperate fear of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries on the brink of extinction.

In human history, all progressive classes' correct thoughts, in their emergence, spread, and development, have always encountered fierce resistance and various attacks from decaying, declining, and reactionary forces. However, the correct thoughts of progressive classes, after fierce struggles, will inevitably achieve victory.

On the eve of the collapse of the feudal system in Europe, Copernicus proposed his theory of the solar system, challenging the divine authority of the reactionary ruling class. Copernicus and later advocates of this theory, such as Bruno and Galileo, were brutally persecuted by the reactionary ruling class at that time. However, science ultimately triumphed. Today, who still believes that the Earth does not revolve around the Sun?

Reactionary forces hate scientific discoveries so much, let alone the revolutionary truths of the proletariat, which they view with extreme hostility.

When Marxism was just born in Europe, the reactionary forces in Europe were in a panic, forming an anti-Marxist "Holy Alliance" to try to "expel" this "ghost."

When Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism, imperialism and traitors and renegades of various countries gathered together, forming a new "Holy Alliance" to launch a frenzied attack against Leninism.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Marxism must develop through struggle; it was like this in the past, it is like this now, and it will inevitably be like this in the future." Over the past more than a hundred years, Marxism has developed greatly through struggle, and the international proletarian revolutionary cause has achieved great victories.

Today, Marxism-Leninism has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are already on the verge of collapse, gasping for breath. They have formed a new "Holy Alliance" to frenziedly oppose Mao Zedong Thought, but they will only meet a more miserable failure than their ancestors.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more fiercely the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must defend, propagate, and spread this invincible and powerful ideological weapon to the revolutionary people of various countries. Once the revolutionary people of the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual atomic bomb, they will surely be able to smash the entire old world to pieces and create a brilliant new world!

    蚍蜉撼树谈何易
    本报评论员
    霹雳千钧，东风万里。随着我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利，光焰无际的毛泽东思想得到了更加广泛的传播，越来越深入人心。毛泽东思想同世界上亿万革命群众相结合，已经成为推动历史前进的不可抵御的巨大力量。
    正是在这样的大好革命形势下，美帝苏修和各国反动派掀起了一股穷凶极恶的反华浪潮。它们口里是骂，心里是怕。而千怕万怕，最最害怕的就是伟大的毛泽东思想。不论在什么地方，美帝苏修和各国反动派，一听到毛泽东思想的宣传，一看到红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，就马上吓得胆战心惊，恐慌万状。它们使尽了一切办法，企图抵制毛泽东思想的传播，恨不得立时三刻就把毛泽东思想从地球上“驱逐”。
    然而，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。毛泽东思想是不可战胜的伟大革命真理，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大的思想武器，是引导各国人民争取解放斗争取得彻底胜利的指路明灯。全世界革命人民热切地寻求毛泽东思想，无比地热爱毛泽东思想，如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想，这是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    毛泽东思想一旦为革命人民所掌握，就会变为改造世界的不可估量的物质力量。中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，怎么会不遭到世界上一切反革命势力的疯狂反对和拚命抵抗呢？这是一场阶级斗争。这场阶级斗争所以这样激烈，恰恰反映了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力，反映了美帝苏修和各国反动派濒于灭亡的恐惧心理。
    在人类历史上，一切先进阶级的正确思想，在它产生、传播和发展的过程中，总要遭到腐朽、没落、反动势力的疯狂抵制和种种打击。但是，先进阶级的正确思想，经过激烈的斗争，必然要取得胜利。
    在欧洲封建制度崩溃的前夕，哥白尼提出关于太阳系的学说，向反动统治阶级的神权挑战。哥白尼和后来坚持这一学说的布鲁诺、伽利略，曾经遭到当时反动统治阶级的野蛮迫害。然而，科学终于取得了胜利。今天，有谁还相信地球不是围绕着太阳转动呢？
    反动势力对于自然科学的新发现，尚且如此仇恨，对于无产阶级的革命真理，就更是极端敌视了。
    当马克思主义刚在欧洲诞生的时候，欧洲的反动势力吓得手忙脚乱，它们结成反马克思主义的“神圣同盟”，妄图“驱逐”这个“怪影”。
    当马克思主义发展到列宁主义阶段的时候，帝国主义以及各国的工贼和叛徒，又纠集在一起，结成反对列宁主义的“神圣同盟”，进行疯狂的围攻。
    但是，正如毛主席所指出的：“马克思主义必须在斗争中才能发展，不但过去是这样，现在是这样，将来也必然还是这样。”一百多年来，马克思主义正是在斗争中得到了巨大的发展，国际无产阶级的革命事业取得了伟大的胜利。
    今天，马克思列宁主义发展到了毛泽东思想的阶段。世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派已经是日薄西山，气息奄奄。它们结成新的“神圣同盟”，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，只能比它们的祖宗们失败得更惨。
  毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”美帝苏修和各国反动派越是疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，我们就越是要捍卫毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，把这个战无不胜的强大思想武器，更广泛地传播给各国的革命人民。全世界革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹，就一定能够把整个旧世界打得落花流水，创造出一个红彤彤的新世界来！
