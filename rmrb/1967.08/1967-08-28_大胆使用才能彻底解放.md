	Boldly Utilizing to Achieve Complete Liberation

	Currently, whether or not one dares to boldly utilize revolutionary cadres is an important indicator of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	Chairman Mao said: "The standpoint of practice is the first and basic standpoint of the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism." Only by boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres and allowing them to work alongside the broad masses to transform the world and themselves through revolutionary practice can they achieve complete liberation. Not daring to boldly utilize revolutionary cadres will inevitably lead to a repetition of the "introspection" approach from "Cultivation of the Self," and it will be impossible for them to truly achieve liberation.

	Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres is not merely about restoring them to their original positions. Rather, it involves, based on the different situations of revolutionary cadres, discussing with the masses and boldly absorbing the good and relatively good cadres into various levels of leadership teams. For cadres who have made mistakes, they should also be given appropriate work.

	Some comrades are hesitant to boldly utilize revolutionary cadres for fear of being labeled "rightist," "conservative," or "restoring capitalism." Such concerns are unnecessary.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: We must believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. To completely liberate revolutionary cadres from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," and to boldly utilize them, is not "rightist" or "conservative," but rather the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; it is not "restoring capitalism," but rather the strengthening and consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship. On the contrary, setting revolutionary cadres aside and letting them continue to stand on the sidelines is a reflection of the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and is not a manifestation of proletarian revolution.

	Currently, we must be particularly vigilant against a small number of class enemies inciting a portion of the misled masses to appear in an ultra-leftist guise, using leftist-sounding but rightist slogans to attack revolutionary cadres and proletarian revolutionaries, and to disrupt the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	We must recognize that the broad revolutionary cadres, after the severe test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have undergone a soul-searching experience. Many cadres who made mistakes in the past, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and the help of revolutionary masses, will mostly turn towards the good. Even cadres who have made serious mistakes, "as long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and remain unrepentant despite repeated teachings, they should be allowed to reform and encouraged to redeem themselves." For cadres who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them, only by boldly utilizing them and letting them experience the storms and see the world in class struggle and production struggle can they deeply recognize their mistakes, correct them, and make amends.

	Boldly liberating revolutionary cadres is a necessity for the current revolutionary situation; only by boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres can they achieve complete liberation. The broad proletarian revolutionaries should respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, with "daring" as the key, and be models in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They should enthusiastically support and help more revolutionary cadres to come forward and work, allowing them to achieve new merits and build new achievements for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    大胆使用才能彻底解放
    当前，敢不敢大胆使用革命干部，是忠于不忠于毛主席革命路线的一个重要标志。
    毛主席说：“实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之第一的和基本的观点。”只有大胆使用革命干部，让他们同广大群众一道，在革命的实践中改造世界，改造自己，才能使他们得到彻底解放。不敢大胆使用革命干部，就必然重复《修养》中“闭门思过”那一套，就不可能使他们真正获得解放。
    大胆使用革命干部，不是一般的官复原职，而是根据革命干部的不同情况，经过群众讨论，把好的和比较好的干部，大胆吸收到各级领导班子中来；对犯有错误的干部，也要让他们担任适当的工作。
    有的同志，不敢大胆使用革命干部，是怕别人给自己扣上“右倾”、“保守”、“资本主义复辟”的帽子。这种顾虑是不必要的。
    毛主席教导我们：要相信和依靠干部的大多数。把革命干部从“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的枷锁下彻底解放出来，大胆使用他们，绝不是什么“右倾”、“保守”，而恰恰是执行了毛主席的革命路线；绝不是什么“资本主义复辟”，而恰恰是加强和巩固了无产阶级政权。相反，把革命干部扔在一边，让他们继续靠边站，这是资产阶级反动路线影响的反映，绝不是无产阶级革命性的表现。
    当前，我们要特别警惕一小撮阶级敌人煽动一部分受蒙蔽的群众，以极“左”的面目出现，用形“左”实右的口号，来打击革命干部和无产阶级革命派，破坏革命的“三结合”。
    我们应当看到，广大革命干部经过无产阶级文化大革命的严峻考验，是触及了灵魂的。一些过去犯有错误的干部，在毛泽东思想的教育和革命群众的帮助下，绝大多数会向好的方面转变。即使犯有严重错误的干部，“只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。”对于犯有错误但愿意改正的干部，只有大胆使用，让他们在阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中经风雨，见世面，才能使他们更深刻地认识错误，改正错误，将功补过。
    大胆解放革命干部，是当前革命形势发展的需要；只有大胆使用革命干部，才能彻底解放革命干部。广大无产阶级革命派应当响应党中央的号召，“敢”字当头，做执行毛主席的干部政策的模范，热情地支持和帮助更多的革命干部站出来工作，让他们为无产阶级文化大革命立新功，建新劳！
