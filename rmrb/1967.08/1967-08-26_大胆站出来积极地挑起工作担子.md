In the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, I went through a tortuous struggle process from executing the bourgeois reactionary line to breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line, from standing on the opposite side of the revolutionary youngsters to resolutely fighting alongside the revolutionary youngsters, and received profound education.

In the early stages of the movement, I was deceived and utilized by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, executing the bourgeois reactionary line and committing crimes against Chairman Mao, the Party, and the revolutionary youngsters. At that time, although I had doubts about the brutal suppression of revolutionary teachers and students and the persecution of a large number of revolutionary cadres by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, due to my worldview not being thoroughly transformed, personal selfish thoughts, and the deep influence of "Cultivation of the Self," I dared not rebel, fearing to be seized, fearing to lose my position, fearing to be labeled a counter-revolutionary, and did not fully understand the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youngsters. Later, the revolutionary youngsters provided me with specific help. I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "rebellion is justified," and recalled my father's hard labor for the landlord before liberation, with the whole family living in miserable conditions of not having enough to eat or wear. I became more aware that it was Chairman Mao who saved my entire family from the sea of suffering, enabling me to join the people's army, attend university, and become a revolutionary cadre. How could I forget the past? How could I allow a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to restore capitalism and push the Chinese people back into the abyss of disaster? "Forgetting the past means betrayal!" Under the enlightenment and help of the revolutionary youngsters, I finally broke through numerous obstacles and rebelled in August last year!

In the process of my standing up, the proletarian revolutionary forces of my school gave me tremendous support and encouragement. It was they who, under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, enlightened and educated me to rebel, writing big-character posters firmly supporting my rebellion; it was they who, after seizing power, organized us revolutionary cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, the editorials of "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and speeches by central leaders, greatly raising my class consciousness; it was they who helped me deeply recognize my mistakes and completely break with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line; it was they who boldly used revolutionary cadres, enabling revolutionary cadres to undergo new tests and make new contributions in the cultural revolution.

What I will never forget is their criticism of my past mistakes. I felt this was the greatest help, the greatest concern, and the greatest support for me. Initially, my understanding of my mistakes was insufficient. When some comrades criticized me more severely, I felt a bit hurt, fearing to be labeled, fearing to lose my authority. Later facts proved that such concerns were completely unnecessary. The youngsters' criticism was not to destroy me but to "correct" me. The mistakes I made in the cultural revolution were not ordinary mistakes but mistakes in direction and line; this mistake was not accidental but closely related to the influence of the revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev over the past decade. Without thorough criticism, I could not deeply recognize, firmly correct, and completely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. My self-examination draft was revised more than ten times. Before the self-examination, it was sent to comrades who had been persecuted by the reactionary line, those who had executed the reactionary line with me, and some students to seek their opinions. It then went through five meetings of exposure and criticism by revolutionary teachers and students of the philosophy department, and finally, a relatively profound self-examination was made. The masses were relatively satisfied with my self-examination, and my burden was lifted, making significant progress in liberating myself.

The revolutionary youngsters are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They believe in and rely on the majority of cadres, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. After I stood up, after making an initial self-examination of my mistakes, the "Weidong" headquarters and the philosophy division leaders often invited me to participate in their meetings and seek my opinions. In April this year, I was officially transferred to work in the political department of the "Weidong" headquarters. At that time, I still had some concerns, feeling that I had made mistakes, been deeply influenced by "Cultivation of the Self," and had many old frameworks, fearing that I could not handle the job and would make mistakes again. Under the help of the youngsters, through several months of practice, I realized that this idea was also wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Learn to swim while swimming." Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in revolutionary practice, humbly learning from revolutionary youngsters, and accepting the supervision and help of revolutionary youngsters, can we truly correct mistakes and redeem ourselves; otherwise, staying in the room, engaging in "Cultivation of the Self" style of introspection, and passively observing, not only cannot correct mistakes, but this attitude itself is a deviation from Mao Zedong Thought. This is very dangerous.

After participating in the work of the political department of the "Weidong" headquarters, I gradually overcame the fear of making mistakes, boldly expressed my opinions, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and did not engage in compromise, mediation, or muddling through; at the same time, with a sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, I helped the revolutionary youngsters to wield power well and use power well. Some of my opinions were correct and adopted, while others were incorrect and, after criticism by the masses, my understanding was raised. If I were to be submissive and hesitant, I would not truly liberate myself. Although Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the revolutionary youngsters have liberated me, if I do not liberate myself, I will still not be thoroughly liberated.

Currently, the great proletarian cultural revolution has entered a crucial moment of decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and the battle cry to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev has been sounded. I must closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow the Party Central Committee, make new contributions in the great criticism, thoroughly transform my worldview, always put active learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place, always put emphasizing proletarian politics in the first place, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, and forever unite, fight, and win with the proletarian revolutionary forces!

    大胆站出来积极地挑起工作担子
    原中共南开大学哲学系总支副书记　郭毅
    在我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我从执行资产阶级反动路线到同资产阶级反动路线决裂，从站在革命小将的对立面到坚决同革命小将战斗在一起，经历了一个曲折的斗争过程，受到一场深刻的教育。
    在运动初期，我受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽和利用，执行了资产阶级反动路线，对毛主席、对党、对革命小将犯了罪。当时，我虽然对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派残酷镇压革命师生和打击大批革命干部表示过怀疑，但由于自己的世界观没有得到彻底改造，私心杂念作怪，加上受《修养》的毒害较深，不敢起来造反，怕被揪，怕丢官，怕被打成反革命，对革命小将的革命行动也不很理解。后来，革命小将对我进行了具体的帮助，我又反复学习了毛主席关于“造反有理”的伟大教导，同时，回忆起解放前父亲给地主扛活，全家老少过着吃不饱穿不暖的悲惨生活，我更清楚地意识到：是毛主席把我全家从苦海中解救出来，使我参加了人民军队，上了大学，当上了革命干部。我怎能忘记过去？怎能让党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义，把中国人民重新推向灾难的深渊？“忘记过去就意味着背叛”！在革命小将的启发和帮助下，我终于冲破重重阻力，在去年八月份造反了！
    在我站出来的过程中，我校无产阶级革命派给了我巨大的支持和鼓舞。是他们，在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，启发教育我起来革命，写出了坚决支持我造反的大字报；是他们，在夺权以后，组织我们广大革命干部学习毛主席著作，学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的社论和中央首长讲话，大大提高了我的阶级觉悟；是他们，帮助我深刻认识错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂；是他们，大胆地使用革命干部，使广大革命干部在文化大革命中经受新的考验，作出了新的贡献。
    特别使我难忘的是他们对我过去所犯错误的批判，我感到这是对我最大的帮助、最大的关怀、最大的支持。起初，我对自己的错误认识很不够，有的同志批评的严厉一些，就感到有点儿疼，怕上纲，怕失掉威信。后来的事实证明，这种顾虑完全是不必要的。小将的批评决不是为了整垮我，而是为了“整”好我。我在文化大革命中所犯的错误决不是一般的错误，而是方向路线的错误；这个错误决不是偶然的，而是和十几年来受中国的赫鲁晓夫推行的一条修正主义路线的影响密切相关的。不痛加批判，就不能深刻认识，就不能坚决改正，就不能彻底回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我的检查稿修改了十几次，检查前曾送给受反动路线迫害的同志、和自己一同执行反动路线的同志及一些同学征求意见，又经过哲学系革命师生五次大会揭发和批判，最后作了一个较为深刻的检查。群众对我的检查比较满意，我的包袱也就放下了，在自己解放自己的道路上大大地前进了一步。
    革命小将最忠实于毛主席的革命路线，他们相信和依靠干部的大多数，执行毛主席的干部政策最坚决。在我站出来以后，对自己的错误作了初步检查，“卫东”总部和哲学分部负责同志就经常邀请我参加他们的会议，征求我的意见。今年四月份，又把我正式调到“卫东”总部政治部工作。当时我还有些顾虑，感到自己犯过错误，受《修养》毒害较深，旧框框较多，怕不能胜任，会再犯错误。在小将的帮助下，通过几个月的实践，认识到这种想法也是不对的。毛主席教导我们：要“在游泳中学会游泳”。只有在革命实践中活学活用毛主席著作，虚心向革命小将学习，接受革命小将的监督和帮助，才能真正地改正错误，立功赎罪；相反，关在房间里，进行《修养》式的闭门思过，消极观望，不但不能改正错误，而且这种态度本身就是背离毛泽东思想的。这样下去，是十分危险的。
    在参加“卫东”总部政治部的工作以后，我逐步克服了怕犯错误的思想，大胆发表自己的意见，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，不搞折衷、调和、和稀泥；同时，本着对党和人民负责的精神，帮助革命小将掌好权、用好权。我的意见有的是对的，被采纳了，有的不对，经过群众批评，认识也就提高了。如果唯唯诺诺，缩手缩脚，那就不是真正地解放自己。虽然毛主席的革命路线和革命小将解放了自己，而自己不能解放自己，仍然不能彻底解放。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命进入了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的战斗号角已经吹响了。我一定要紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央，在革命的大批判中立新功，彻底改造世界观。一定要时时刻刻地把活学活用毛主席著作摆在第一位，把突出无产阶级政治摆在第一位，跟毛主席干一辈子革命，永远和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
