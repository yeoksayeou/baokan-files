The Chinese Embassy in Burma has exposed the Ne Win fascist government's new conspiracy to persecute overseas Chinese and warned the Ne Win government to immediately stop its actions. It strongly protests the Burmese reactionary government's unreasonable detention of relief supplies sent by the Chinese government to the affected overseas Chinese.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 1, Yangon: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 31, sternly exposing that the Ne Win fascist government is actively plotting a new, larger-scale massacre, mass arrests, and persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese. The Chinese Embassy has issued the most serious and urgent warning to the Ne Win fascist government: You must immediately withdraw your blood-stained hands!

The note stated that according to reliable information obtained by the Chinese Embassy, the Ne Win fascist government, in order to completely eliminate the patriotic and progressive forces among the overseas Chinese in Burma and to achieve the evil goal of brutally suppressing the patriotic and progressive activities of the overseas Chinese, will soon carry out a larger-scale mass arrest of patriotic overseas Chinese across Burma. The special agencies of the Ne Win government, in collusion with the remnants of the Kuomintang in Burma, have secretly compiled a blacklist for the mass arrests, which includes hundreds of overseas Chinese from all over Burma who have consistently loved their motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao, and who have actively engaged in cultural and welfare activities for overseas Chinese, as well as leaders and staff of social organizations, part-time teachers of supplementary classes, and overseas Chinese youth students. To facilitate the implementation of this conspiracy, the Ne Win fascist government continues to impose a military blockade on the Yangon overseas Chinese district, strengthen the rule of special agencies, deprive patriotic overseas Chinese of their right to handle repatriation procedures at the Chinese Embassy, and restrict the freedom of action of patriotic overseas Chinese. Meanwhile, the Burmese special agencies, under the pretext of "household registration," continue to collect the blacklist for mass arrests. Personnel from the Burmese "Program Party" and the State Administrative Council are also using the collection of "Burma-China Friendship Signatures" and the distribution of relief supplies as a pretext to attempt to deceive and buy off patriotic overseas Chinese with a few sweet words and small favors, in order to achieve their despicable goal of splitting the patriotic overseas Chinese.

The note stated that at this critical moment, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China issues the most serious and urgent warning to the Ne Win fascist government: You must immediately withdraw your blood-stained hands! You must immediately lift the military blockade on the Yangon overseas Chinese district; stop the surveillance and persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese by your special agencies; genuinely guarantee the normal life and survival rights of patriotic overseas Chinese; ensure the freedom of patriotic overseas Chinese to engage in activities that love the motherland and love the great leader Chairman Mao and to engage in all their affairs; and immediately release all patriotic overseas Chinese who have been illegally detained by you.

The Chinese Embassy solemnly declared in the note: "The patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma are good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and are the close kin of the great seven hundred million Chinese people. You dare to persecute the patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma, which is the most serious provocation to the Chinese people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate this and will take effective measures to punish you."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 1, Yangon: The Ne Win reactionary government, disregarding repeated warnings from the Chinese government, on July 31 openly detained the first batch of 40 boxes of relief supplies sent by the Chinese government on behalf of the seven hundred million Chinese people to the affected overseas Chinese at the Mingaladon Airport in Yangon. The Chinese Embassy in Burma immediately lodged the strongest protest with the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs over this unprecedented serious incident in the history of international diplomatic relations.

Before sending this batch of relief supplies, the Chinese government had notified the Burmese Embassy in China that on the morning of July 31, the first batch of 40 boxes of relief supplies would be sent to Yangon via a Chinese civilian aircraft to relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese who have been brutally persecuted by the Ne Win fascist regime.

When the Chinese civilian aircraft arrived at Mingaladon Airport in Yangon, an official from the Burmese Customs unreasonably demanded to detain all the relief supplies. Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel immediately protested on the spot and pointed out that the Burmese Customs had no right to obstruct the delivery of relief supplies from China to Yangon. The Chinese Embassy had made arrangements through diplomatic channels for the retrieval of these supplies. After the Chinese diplomatic personnel protested, the Burmese Customs official agreed to store the Chinese relief supplies in a warehouse for the Chinese Embassy to retrieve. However, after receiving instructions from a special agent and a colonel, he insisted on detaining the supplies. The Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel immediately pointed out in a righteous and stern manner that the Chinese government and the seven hundred million Chinese people have the right to express concern and provide relief to their persecuted compatriots. This is entirely in accordance with the norms of international relations. Afterwards, the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, Xiao Ming, requested a meeting with the Executive Secretary of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Ohn Kyin. After a long delay and unreasonable behavior, U Ohn Kyin had no choice but to meet with the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires. During the meeting, U Ohn Kyin could not give any reason for detaining the Chinese relief supplies but only unreasonably repeated that "the Chinese government has no right to question this decision because it involves a matter of principle." The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires sternly pointed out that sending relief supplies to the affected overseas Chinese to express the concern of the Chinese government and people is a sacred right of the Chinese government and people, and no one can take it away.

    我大使馆揭露奈温法西斯政府策划迫害华侨的新阴谋
    警告奈温政府必须立即住手
    强烈抗议缅甸反动政府无理扣留我政府救济受害华侨的物资
    据新华社一日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆七月三十一日递交缅甸外交部的照会中，严正揭露奈温法西斯政府正积极策划对爱国华侨进行新的更大规模的大屠杀、大逮捕和大迫害。中国大使馆最严重地最紧急地警告奈温法西斯政府：你们必须立即收回你们罪恶的血手！
    照会说，据中国大使馆掌握的确实材料，奈温法西斯政府为了达到彻底消灭旅缅华侨中的爱国和进步的力量和血腥镇压华侨爱国进步活动的罪恶目的，在最近期间将在全缅各地对爱国华侨进行一次更大规模的大逮捕。奈温政府的特务部门为此已经伙同在缅甸的蒋帮分子秘密制订了大逮捕的黑名单，其中包括全缅各地一贯热爱祖国、热爱中国人民伟大领袖毛主席，积极从事华侨文化福利事业的数百名华侨工商界人士、社会团体负责人和工作人员、业余补习班教师和华侨青年学生等。为了便于实现这一大阴谋，目前奈温法西斯政府继续对仰光华侨区实行军事封锁，加强特务统治，剥夺爱国华侨来中国大使馆办理回国手续的正当权利，限制爱国华侨一切行动自由。与此同时，缅甸特务部门正在以“清查户口”为名，继续收集大逮捕的黑名单。缅甸“纲领党”和安全行政委员会的人员，也以收集“缅中友好签名”和施放救济品为名，企图以几句甜言蜜语，一点小恩小惠对爱国华侨进行卑鄙的欺骗和收买，以达到其分化爱国华侨的卑鄙目的。
    照会说，在这紧急关头，中华人民共和国大使馆最严重地最紧急地警告奈温法西斯政府：你们必须立即收回你们罪恶的血手！你们必须立即撤除对仰光华侨区的军事封锁；停止你们特务机关对爱国华侨的监视和迫害；切实保证爱国华侨的正常生活和生存的权利；保障爱国华侨进行热爱祖国和热爱伟大领袖毛主席的活动和他们从事一切事务活动的自由；立即释放被你们非法扣押的全部爱国华侨。
    中国大使馆在照会中严正声明：“旅缅爱国华侨是中华民族的好儿女，是伟大的七亿中国人民的亲骨肉。你们胆敢迫害旅缅爱国华侨就是对中国人民最严重的挑衅，中国政府和中国人民对此绝对不能容忍，必将采取有效的措施来制裁你们。”
    据新华社一日讯　仰光消息：奈温反动政府不顾中国政府一再警告，七月三十一日公然在仰光明加拉顿机场强行扣留了中国政府代表七亿中国人民运送给受害华侨的第一批四十箱救济物资。中国驻缅甸大使馆在当天就这一在国际外交关系史上罕见的严重事件向缅甸外交部提出了最强烈的抗议。
    中国政府在运送这批救济物资前，曾经通知缅甸驻中国大使馆，在七月三十一日上午经中国民航飞机运出第一批四十箱救济物资到仰光，以救济被奈温法西斯政权残酷迫害的缅甸华侨。
    当中国民航飞机到达仰光明加拉顿机场时，缅甸海关的一个负责官员无理地要扣留所有救济物资。中国大使馆外交人员当场向他提出抗议，并指出，缅甸海关没有任何权利阻挠中国向仰光运送救济物资，中国大使馆已经通过外交手续为提取这些物资作了安排。在中国外交人员提出抗议以后，缅甸海关的负责人员同意把中国救济物资存放在仓库里，等中国大使馆提取。但是，这个负责人员在得到一个特务和一个中校的指示后，又坚持要扣留。中国大使馆外交人员当即义正词严地指出，中国政府和七亿中国人民完全有权利对受迫害的同胞表示关切和给予救济。这是完全符合国际关系准则的。此后，中国大使馆临时代办肖明要求会见缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦。吴翁钦在长时间拖延和无理取闹以后，不得不会见中国临时代办。在会见时，吴翁钦说不出任何扣留中国救济物资的理由，而只是无理地重复说“中国政府无权质问这方面的决定，因为这一决定涉及到原则内容。”中国临时代办严正指出，运送救济物资给受害华侨以表示中国政府和人民的关怀，这是中国政府和人民的神圣权利，任何人都不能剥夺。
