Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital held a symposium to commemorate the first anniversary of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They expressed their revolutionary fervor, praised the epoch-making significance of this central plenary session, hailed the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, and resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and to carry the Cultural Revolution to complete victory.

The Greatest Conference, the Most Radiant Year

Wang Qifu, a representative of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the PLA Air Force Direct Subordinate Units, said: At the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," personally presided over the formulation of the Sixteen Points, and issued the session's communiqué. These documents further systematically expounded the theory, line, policy, method, and measures for carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out the victorious path for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and advancing socialism toward communism. These documents have greatly promoted the Cultural Revolution throughout the country.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee further established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, which is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of our Party and state and the future of the international communist movement. Whether or not to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought is the focal point of the struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters. The attitude toward Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental criterion for distinguishing revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists from counter-revolutionary revisionists. In the Cultural Revolution, we must use the attitude toward Mao Zedong Thought as the main criterion for distinguishing proletarian leaders from those in power who are taking the capitalist road. We will fight against anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely overthrow them; we will firmly support anyone who is loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao is our great leader Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms. He holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest and has consistently stood firmly on Chairman Mao's side in all struggles between the two lines within the Party, bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee designated Comrade Lin Biao as our deputy helmsman, which is the most reliable guarantee for the Chinese people to advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Guo Zhongbo, a representative of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Stamp Factory, said: Over the past year, the greatest achievement of the Cultural Revolution has been the exposure and overthrow of the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and the exposure of a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which has greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory has also engaged in fierce struggles with a handful of those in power within the factory who are taking the capitalist road. Finally, during the "January Revolution" storm, we removed their positions and seized their power. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, we bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, making the entire factory look completely new. We have cleansed all the mud and dirt from the stamps and eliminated those stamps that propagandized emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Stamps featuring the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao and golden Mao Zedong Quotations stamps have now been seen by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Deng Wantian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and a leader of the core group of the Agricultural Representatives Congress, said: This year has been a year of widespread dissemination and promotion of the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions have all placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, lead everything, promote everything, and transform everything. The rural areas on the outskirts of Beijing have completely changed the situation where the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique obstructed the masses from studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, no matter which village you go to, you can see many members diligently studying and seriously applying what they learn, studying a little and applying a little, resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the most important basic construction project in our capital, and it is the most outstanding achievement of the Cultural Revolution over the past year.

Under the cultivation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and in the great storms of class struggle, a large number of new talents loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been tempered. The young generation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is growing rapidly. Many young revolutionaries in the Revolutionary Committee dare to think, speak, act, and do everything according to Mao Zedong Thought, breaking through many old frameworks, and playing a significant role in promoting the revolutionization of the old cadres' ideology and work style in the Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionization of the leading organs. The young pioneers who emerged during the Cultural Revolution in our Zhaoli Brigade are now taking on the main leadership work of the brigade, and both revolution and production are going well.

Advance Victoriously to Thoroughly Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters

Wang Xiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: The current central task facing the proletarian revolutionary factions is to thoroughly criticize politically, ideologically, and theoretically the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

"We must pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must clearly see that although China's Khrushchev and the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, they are still alive and their spirits are not dead, and they are still waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. They still have "power," and this power is political and ideological power. The revisionist goods they have long promoted are still poisoning the people. To complete the seizure of power politically and ideologically, we must launch a widespread and in-depth revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison spread by the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in various fields.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle and soul of the criticism. To launch a high tide of criticism, we must first launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In our criticism, we must first study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, grasp the red line of Mao Zedong Thought, and criticize and uproot the black line of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, which is currently developing in depth. We must carry the revolutionary criticism to the end and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

Study Chairman Mao's Works Well, Grasp Power and Use Power Well

Liu Boqiao, a representative of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, said: The practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year has made us deeply realize that to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, we must closely follow Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's strategic deployment; we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and fully carry out great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key issue is in learning well." We proletarian revolutionary factions must grasp power and use power well, and we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, combining them with actual struggles, repeatedly and seriously studying Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and measures for carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that our thoughts and actions are all in line with Mao Zedong Thought.

Correctly handling the relationship with the masses is a fundamental issue of worldview and a great revolution in thought to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. After the proletarian revolutionary factions take power, they must closely connect with the masses, both being officials and being common people, and never leaving the masses. We must correctly handle ourselves, fully carry out democracy, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, dare to continuously affirm the correct things, and correct the wrong things. While fiercely striking at the class enemies, we must continuously promote the revolutionization of our own thoughts, so as to ensure that our red new regime will never change color.

Tian Yisen, a representative of the Dongfanghong Commune of the Beijing Lamp Factory, said: Based on our experience over the past year, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, we need two "dares" at the forefront: daring to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and daring to seize power from the bourgeois ideology in our own minds; we need two kinds of revolutionary rebel spirits: daring to rebel against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and daring to rebel against the selfishness in our own minds; we need to complete two transformations: while transforming the objective world, we must also transform our subjective world. After the proletarian revolutionary factions take power, they must never relax their own ideological transformation.

After our factory's proletarian revolutionary factions took power, some unhealthy tendencies emerged. Some people began to separate themselves from the masses in their work and lifestyle. In March, the PLA comrades entered the factory, saw this situation, and helped us study Chairman Mao's works. Through study, we clearly realized that the proletarian revolutionary factions must grasp power and use power well, and while transforming others, we must dare to transform ourselves.

Recently, we spent two weeks rectifying our work, and everyone, with a spirit of absolute responsibility to the revolution, let the masses criticize us and point out our mistakes. We also examined and corrected our own mistakes. The facts show that letting the revolutionary masses criticize us, we only discard bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, but we gain the support and approval of the broad revolutionary masses. Currently, our Dongfanghong Commune has developed and grown to an unprecedented extent. A powerful movement to criticize the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has arisen throughout the factory.

    沿着毛主席指引的航向夺取文化大革命彻底胜利
    ——首都无产阶级革命派代表举行座谈纪念党的八届十一中全会一周年
    本报讯　首都一些单位无产阶级革命派的代表举行座谈，热烈纪念党的八届十一中全会召开一周年。他们满怀革命豪情，歌颂了这次中央全会的划时代的意义，欢呼一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，决心更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行到底。
    最伟大的会议　最光辉的一年
    人民解放军空军直属机关无产阶级革命派代表王启夫说：在党的八届十一中全会上，我们伟大领袖毛主席写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，亲自主持制定了十六条，发表了全会公报。这些文献进一步系统地阐明了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，指明了巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟，使社会主义向共产主义前进的胜利道路。这些文件，极大地推动了全国的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    党的八届十一中全会进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，这是关系到我们党和国家命运、关系到国际共产主义运动前途的头等大事。要不要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部斗争的焦点。对待毛泽东思想的态度，是区别革命与反革命，马克思列宁主义者同反革命修正主义分子的根本标志。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们就是要把对待毛泽东思想的态度，作为区别无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的主要标准。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就同谁作斗争，就坚决把他打倒；谁忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，我们就坚决支持谁。
    林彪副主席是我们伟大领袖毛主席最亲密的战友，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，在历次党内两条路线斗争中，一贯坚定地站在毛主席一边，英勇地捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线。八届十一中全会确定林彪同志为我们的副统帅，这是使我国人民在毛泽东思想旗帜下胜利前进最可靠的保证。
    北京邮票厂革命造反总部代表戈中博说：一年来，无产阶级文化大革命最大的战果，就是揭露和打垮了以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这就大大巩固了无产阶级专政。
    我们厂的无产阶级革命派，也同厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了激烈的搏斗，终于在“一月革命”风暴中，罢了他们的官，夺了他们的权。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，使全厂面貌焕然一新。我们已经荡涤了邮票上的一切污泥浊水，清除了那些宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人、花鸟鱼虫为复辟资本主义作舆论准备的邮票。印有神采奕奕的伟大领袖毛主席像的邮票、金光闪闪的毛主席语录邮票，已经同广大工农兵见面了。
    北京市革命委员会常委、农代会核心组负责人邓万田说：这一年，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想大普及、大传播的一年。广大无产阶级革命派，都把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切，改造一切。京郊农村也完全改变了彭真反革命修正主义集团统治时阻挠群众学习毛主席著作的状况。现在，不论走到哪个村，都可以看到许多社员在刻苦地学，认真地用，学一点，用一点，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。这是我们首都头等重要的基本建设，这是一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的最突出的一个收获。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的培育下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，锻炼出了大批忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新的人材，无产阶级革命事业接班人的青年一代在迅速成长。市革命委员会里的许多革命小将，敢想敢说敢闯敢干，一切要求按毛泽东思想办事，冲破了许多旧框框，对于革命委员会中老干部的思想作风的革命化、对于领导机关的革命化，起了很大的促进作用。我们翟里大队在文化大革命中涌现出来的青年闯将，现在担任大队的主要领导工作，革命、生产都搞得挺好。
    乘胜前进彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
    中国科学院革命委员会常委王锡鹏说：当前，摆在无产阶级革命派面前的中心任务，是要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级的司令部。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们必须清醒地看到，中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派虽然被揪出来了，但是他们人还在，心不死，仍在时刻伺机反扑。他们仍然有“权”，这个权就是政治思想上的权。他们长期推行的一套修正主义的货色还在毒害人民。我们要完成政治思想上的夺权，就要开展广泛深入的革命的大批判，清除党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在各个领域内散布的流毒。
    毛泽东思想是大批判的指针和灵魂。要掀起大批判的高潮，必须首先掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。我们在大批判中，要首先学习毛主席的有关指示，掌握住毛泽东思想的红线，去批判和挖掉反革命修正主义的黑线。
    我们中国科学院的无产阶级革命派已经掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，目前正向纵深发展。我们一定要把革命的大批判进行到底，不获全胜决不收兵。
    学好毛主席著作　掌好权用好权
    北京航空学院红旗战斗队代表刘博晓说：一年来文化大革命的实践，使我们深深体会到，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就要紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的战略部署；就要相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，充分发扬无产阶级专政下的大民主。
    毛主席教导我们：“重要的问题在善于学习”。我们无产阶级革命派要掌好权，用好权，就得很好地活学活用毛主席著作，就得结合实际斗争，反复地、认真地学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，使自己的思想和行动都纳入毛泽东思想的轨道。
    正确对待群众，是世界观的根本转变问题，是一场破私立公的思想大革命。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，必须密切联系群众，既当“官”，又当老百姓，一刻也不能脱离群众。要正确地对待自己，充分发扬民主，虚心听取群众意见，敢于不断地肯定正确的东西，改正错误的东西。在狠狠地打击阶级敌人的同时，不断地促进自己思想的革命化，才能保证我们红色的新政权永远不改变颜色。
    北京灯泡厂东方红公社代表田义森说：根据我们一年来的体会，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，需要有两个“敢”字当头：敢于夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，敢于夺自己头脑中资产阶级思想的权；要有两种革命造反精神：敢于造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，敢于造自己头脑中私字的反；要完成两个改造：在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，绝不能放松自己的思想改造。
    我们厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，出现过一些不健康的苗头。有人在工作上、生活作风上开始有些脱离群众。三月份解放军同志进厂，看到这种情况，就帮助我们学习毛主席著作。通过学习，我们清醒地认识到，无产阶级革命派要掌好权、用好权，就得在革别人的命的同时，勇于革自己的命。
    最近，我们用两个星期的时间进行了整风，大家以对革命绝对负责的精神，让群众给我们提意见，批评我们。我们自己也是有错误就检查，就改正。事实说明，让革命群众批评我们，我们丢掉的不过是资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，得到的却是广大革命群众的支持和拥护。目前，我们东方红公社空前地发展壮大起来了。声势浩大的批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动，在全厂兴起了。
