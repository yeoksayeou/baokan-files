Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital held a symposium to commemorate the first anniversary of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They expressed their revolutionary fervor, praised the epoch-making significance of this central plenary session, hailed the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, and resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and to carry the Cultural Revolution to complete victory.

The Greatest Conference, the Most Radiant Year

Wang Qifu, a representative of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the PLA Air Force Direct Subordinate Units, said: At the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," personally presided over the formulation of the Sixteen Points, and issued the session's communiqu√©. These documents further systematically expounded the theory, line, policy, method, and measures for carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out the victorious path for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and advancing socialism toward communism. These documents have greatly promoted the Cultural Revolution throughout the country.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee further established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, which is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of our Party and state and the future of the international communist movement. Whether or not to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought is the focal point of the struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters. The attitude toward Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental criterion for distinguishing revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists from counter-revolutionary revisionists. In the Cultural Revolution, we must use the attitude toward Mao Zedong Thought as the main criterion for distinguishing proletarian leaders from those in power who are taking the capitalist road. We will fight against anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely overthrow them; we will firmly support anyone who is loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao is our great leader Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms. He holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest and has consistently stood firmly on Chairman Mao's side in all struggles between the two lines within the Party, bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee designated Comrade Lin Biao as our deputy helmsman, which is the most reliable guarantee for the Chinese people to advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Guo Zhongbo, a representative of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Stamp Factory, said: Over the past year, the greatest achievement of the Cultural Revolution has been the exposure and overthrow of the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and the exposure of a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which has greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory has also engaged in fierce struggles with a handful of those in power within the factory who are taking the capitalist road. Finally, during the "January Revolution" storm, we removed their positions and seized their power. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, we bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, making the entire factory look completely new. We have cleansed all the mud and dirt from the stamps and eliminated those stamps that propagandized emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Stamps featuring the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao and golden Mao Zedong Quotations stamps have now been seen by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Deng Wantian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and a leader of the core group of the Agricultural Representatives Congress, said: This year has been a year of widespread dissemination and promotion of the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions have all placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, lead everything, promote everything, and transform everything. The rural areas on the outskirts of Beijing have completely changed the situation where the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique obstructed the masses from studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, no matter which village you go to, you can see many members diligently studying and seriously applying what they learn, studying a little and applying a little, resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the most important basic construction project in our capital, and it is the most outstanding achievement of the Cultural Revolution over the past year.

Under the cultivation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and in the great storms of class struggle, a large number of new talents loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been tempered. The young generation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is growing rapidly. Many young revolutionaries in the Revolutionary Committee dare to think, speak, act, and do everything according to Mao Zedong Thought, breaking through many old frameworks, and playing a significant role in promoting the revolutionization of the old cadres' ideology and work style in the Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionization of the leading organs. The young pioneers who emerged during the Cultural Revolution in our Zhaoli Brigade are now taking on the main leadership work of the brigade, and both revolution and production are going well.

Advance Victoriously to Thoroughly Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters

Wang Xiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: The current central task facing the proletarian revolutionary factions is to thoroughly criticize politically, ideologically, and theoretically the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

"We must pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must clearly see that although China's Khrushchev and the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, they are still alive and their spirits are not dead, and they are still waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. They still have "power," and this power is political and ideological power. The revisionist goods they have long promoted are still poisoning the people. To complete the seizure of power politically and ideologically, we must launch a widespread and in-depth revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison spread by the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in various fields.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle and soul of the criticism. To launch a high tide of criticism, we must first launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In our criticism, we must first study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, grasp the red line of Mao Zedong Thought, and criticize and uproot the black line of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, which is currently developing in depth. We must carry the revolutionary criticism to the end and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

Study Chairman Mao's Works Well, Grasp Power and Use Power Well

Liu Boqiao, a representative of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, said: The practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year has made us deeply realize that to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, we must closely follow Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's strategic deployment; we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and fully carry out great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key issue is in learning well." We proletarian revolutionary factions must grasp power and use power well, and we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, combining them with actual struggles, repeatedly and seriously studying Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and measures for carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that our thoughts and actions are all in line with Mao Zedong Thought.

Correctly handling the relationship with the masses is a fundamental issue of worldview and a great revolution in thought to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. After the proletarian revolutionary factions take power, they must closely connect with the masses, both being officials and being common people, and never leaving the masses. We must correctly handle ourselves, fully carry out democracy, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, dare to continuously affirm the correct things, and correct the wrong things. While fiercely striking at the class enemies, we must continuously promote the revolutionization of our own thoughts, so as to ensure that our red new regime will never change color.

Tian Yisen, a representative of the Dongfanghong Commune of the Beijing Lamp Factory, said: Based on our experience over the past year, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, we need two "dares" at the forefront: daring to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and daring to seize power from the bourgeois ideology in our own minds; we need two kinds of revolutionary rebel spirits: daring to rebel against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and daring to rebel against the selfishness in our own minds; we need to complete two transformations: while transforming the objective world, we must also transform our subjective world. After the proletarian revolutionary factions take power, they must never relax their own ideological transformation.

After our factory's proletarian revolutionary factions took power, some unhealthy tendencies emerged. Some people began to separate themselves from the masses in their work and lifestyle. In March, the PLA comrades entered the factory, saw this situation, and helped us study Chairman Mao's works. Through study, we clearly realized that the proletarian revolutionary factions must grasp power and use power well, and while transforming others, we must dare to transform ourselves.

Recently, we spent two weeks rectifying our work, and everyone, with a spirit of absolute responsibility to the revolution, let the masses criticize us and point out our mistakes. We also examined and corrected our own mistakes. The facts show that letting the revolutionary masses criticize us, we only discard bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, but we gain the support and approval of the broad revolutionary masses. Currently, our Dongfanghong Commune has developed and grown to an unprecedented extent. A powerful movement to criticize the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has arisen throughout the factory.
