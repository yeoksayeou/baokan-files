National Defense Science and Technology Commission direct-affiliated units, along with the General Staff, General Logistics, and the three services' Beijing-based scientific research units, held a joint meeting of the proletarian revolutionary factions. They angrily exposed and criticized the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the national defense science and technology system. They vowed to forever follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao and advance bravely!

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, according to "Liberation Army Daily" report: "One should pursue the fleeing enemy to the end, and not seek fame like Xiang Yu." In the midst of the nationwide wave of thorough criticism to smash the bourgeois headquarters, the proletarian revolutionary factions of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission direct-affiliated units, as well as the General Staff, General Logistics, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force scientific research units in Beijing, recently held a joint meeting. They angrily exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in the military, the counter-revolutionary revisionist conspirators Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the national defense science and technology system.

Relevant department heads such as Su Yu, Wang Shusheng, Xiang Zhonghua, Zhang Xianyao, Zheng Weishan, Luo Xunchu, Wang Hongkun, Chang Qinkun, Chen Renqi, Liu Huaqing, Huang Wenming, Zhao Guozhen, Luo Huasheng, Liu Zhong, and Zong Weiqin attended the meeting. Representatives from the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing-based national defense science and technology units were also invited to attend.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the national defense science and technology system, with indignation, wielded the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating the "falling dog," exposed and criticized Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. They pointed out that these counter-revolutionary revisionists were guilty of countless crimes, which boiled down to opposing our great leader Chairman Mao and opposing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve their evil goals of usurping the military and the Party and restoring capitalism, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, they consistently opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They opposed the correct policies set by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for the national defense science and technology industry, which emphasized self-reliance, hard work, and striving for excellence, aiming to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels. They crazily pushed a line of slavishness, crawling, and abolitionism. They fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance and striving for excellence, willingly becoming vassals of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and shamelessly promoting and selling slavishness to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. They shouted slogans like "long-range missiles rely on the Soviet Union" and "if the East doesn't shine, the West will; we can buy some from capitalist countries," attempting to drag our great socialist country's national defense science and technology industry back to the old colonial and semi-colonial path! They crazily opposed Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "catching up," and promoted crawling, viciously attacking the national defense science and technology industry's pursuit of the highest peaks, calling it "overreaching," "too ambitious," and "detached from reality." They spread reactionary fallacies like "feeling the stones to cross the river," stubbornly crawling along the capitalist and revisionist path. They also promoted abolitionism in the national defense science and technology industry. On one hand, they set obstacles, restricted, and strangled the development of the national defense science and technology industry; on the other hand, they spread rumors and slandered, downgrading the achievements of the national defense science and technology industry, attacking it as "from design to design, from data to data, achieving nothing." Even more viciously, under the planning of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, they concealed and suppressed, formed cliques, and recruited traitors, using Khrushchev-style sudden attacks to conspire to seize the leadership of the national defense science and technology industry, and carried out large-scale cuts and demolitions of research institutions. In the national defense science and technology system, they emphasized that "research should adapt to production and is also for production," blatantly abolishing class struggle and scientific experiments, even merging production struggle with scientific experiments "into one," openly opposing Chairman Mao's directive that the three great revolutionary movements should be guided by class struggle. This is a thorough and complete anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary fighters, recalling the arduous journey of the sharp, intense, and complex struggle between the two lines on the national defense science and technology front over the past decade, spoke with immense excitement and pride. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership and care of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the broad masses of revolutionary scientists broke through countless difficulties, worked hard, and achieved great successes. The atomic bomb, missile, and hydrogen bomb tests were successful, and the great prophecy of our great leader Chairman Mao was realized.

The proletarian revolutionary factions emphasized that the struggle between the two lines on the national defense science and technology front, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the direct command of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, has achieved great victories, but the struggle is far from over. A small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are not reconciled to their failures. "The enemy will not be eliminated on its own." We must "not be overly naive and simplify the complex class struggle." We must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, verbally and in writing, to thoroughly expose, criticize, and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and their agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, on the national defense science and technology front! Completely eliminate all their poisonous influences in the national defense science and technology system. The meeting, in the letter of tribute to Chairman Mao and the initiative letter to the proletarian revolutionary factions on the national defense science and technology front, expressed the determination to forever follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, bravely advance against the great winds and waves of class struggle!

    把国防科研战线上的两条路线斗争进行到底
    沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道夺取更光辉胜利
    国防科委直属机关及总参、总后和三军驻京科研单位无产阶级革命派联合集会，愤怒揭发和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿等在国防科研系统中推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，决心永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，奋勇前进！
    新华社二十七日讯　据《解放军报》报道：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”在举国上下掀起彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的革命大批判新高潮中，国防科委直属机关以及总参、总后和陆、海、空三军驻京科研单位的无产阶级革命派，最近联合举行集会，愤怒揭发和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人、阴谋篡军篡党的反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿等在国防科研系统中推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。
    有关部门的负责同志粟裕、王树声、向仲华、张贤约、郑维山、罗舜初、王宏坤、常乾坤、陈仁麒、刘华清、黄文明、查国桢、罗华生、刘忠、宗维栻等参加了大会。驻京国防科研单位的无产阶级革命派和革命群众组织的代表也应邀参加了大会。
    国防科研系统无产阶级革命派，满腔怒火，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上对彭德怀、罗瑞卿等反革命修正主义分子作了坚决有力的揭发和批判。大家愤怒地指出，这些反革命修正主义分子罪恶累累，归结到一点，就是反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席，反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们为达到篡军、篡党、实现资本主义反革命复辟的罪恶目的，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对毛主席和林副主席为国防科研事业制定的鼓足干劲，力争上游，自力更生，奋发图强，树雄心，立大志，赶超世界先进科学水平的正确方针，疯狂地推行了一条奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的反革命修正主义路线。他们极力对抗毛主席关于奋发图强、自力更生的方针，甘心当美帝、苏修的附庸，大肆推行和兜售投降美帝、苏修的奴隶主义，叫嚷什么“导弹远程的靠苏联”，什么“东方不亮西方亮，可以从资本主义国家买一点”等等投降主义论调，妄图把我们伟大社会主义国家的国防科研事业，拉回到殖民地半殖民地的老路上去！他们疯狂反对毛主席关于“赶超”的伟大战略思想，大肆鼓吹爬行主义，恶毒攻击国防科研攀登尖端高峰，是什么“自不量力”、“好高鹜远”、“脱离实际”，散布什么要“摸着石头过河”等反动谬论，死心塌地沿着资本主义、修正主义的道路爬行。他们对国防科研事业还推行取消主义。一方面设置障碍，限制和扼杀国防科研事业的发展；一方面造谣诬蔑，贬低国防科研的成绩，攻击国防科研是“从设计到设计，从资料到资料，一事无成”。更加恶毒的是，在党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派幕后策划下，他们瞒上压下，结党营私，招降纳叛，使用赫鲁晓夫式的突然袭击，阴谋篡夺国防科研事业的领导权，大砍大拆研究机构。他们在国防科研系统中，强调“科研要适应生产，同时也是为了生产”，明目张胆地取消阶级斗争，取消科学实验，甚至把生产斗争与科学实验“合二而一”，公然与毛主席提出的三大革命运动以阶级斗争为纲的指示相对抗，这是彻头彻尾的反毛泽东思想。
    无产阶级革命派战士联系国防科研战线十几年来尖锐、激烈、复杂的两条路线斗争的艰难历程，怀着无比激动、无比自豪的心情说，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的领导和关怀下，广大的革命科研人员突破了重重困难，艰苦奋斗，取得了伟大的成绩。原子弹、导弹、氢弹试验成功了，我们伟大领袖毛主席的预言实现了。
    无产阶级革命派强调指出，国防科研战线上的两条路线斗争，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，在毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的直接指挥下，取得了伟大的胜利，但是斗争还远远没有结束。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是不甘心于他们的失败的。“敌人是不会自行消灭的”。我们“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”我们必须高举革命的批判大旗，口诛笔伐，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿等在国防科研战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线批深、批透、批倒、批臭！彻底肃清他们在国防科研系统的一切流毒。会议在给毛主席的致敬信和给国防科研战线无产阶级革命派的倡议书中表示，决心永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪，奋勇前进！
