Under the personal care of the great leader Chairman Mao, in the midst of the high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is proclaimed established. Twelve hundred thousand soldiers and civilians held a grand celebration. Amidst enthusiastic cheers, a telegram of respect was sent to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. The "August 18" revolutionary organizations, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and revolutionary cadres resolutely declared: We will raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and create a new Qinghai that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 12: On the joyous occasion of the first anniversary of the convening of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, and in the midst of the high tide of revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Qinghai, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qinghai achieved revolutionary great unity and "three-in-one combination." On August 12, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, composed of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai, and revolutionary leading cadres, was born. The victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qinghai in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line on the Qinghai Plateau.

On August 12, the ancient city of Xining on the plateau was adorned with red flags and filled with joy. At dawn, when the sun rose, twelve hundred thousand proletarian revolutionary fighters, revolutionary masses, and fully armed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China, holding high red flags, carrying giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, clutching red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beating drums and gongs, marched proudly towards the venue of the celebration, holding a grand meeting to celebrate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The meeting began with the song "The East is Red." The chairman of the meeting and first deputy chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Zhang Jianglin, solemnly proclaimed in his opening speech: The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is officially established! Immediately, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic cheers: "Heartily congratulate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is the result of the victory achieved by the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Qinghai under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in their heroic struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines within Qinghai is extremely sharp and complex. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ronghui, instructed their agents in Qinghai to seize the power of the Party and the government, attempting to turn Qinghai into a strategic base for their capitalist restoration. In recent years, they have been waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, opposing the great leader Chairman Mao, who is most beloved and respected by the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, and opposing the workers and peasants in their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. On all fronts, they have implemented a whole set of revisionist lines, launching a fierce attack on the proletariat. In rural areas and pastoral regions, they have spread the evil winds of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-dependence," "two guarantees and one reward," and so on. In ethnic work and united front work, they have promoted capitulationism, vigorously supporting feudalism and capitalist forces. Since our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world, they have used every means to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, confusing right and wrong, and turning many revolutionary masses and cadres into "counter-revolutionaries." The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses, fearless of heaven and earth, sang loudly in the white terror, "Looking up, I see the Northern Dipper, in my heart, I think of Mao Zedong," using their blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At the critical moment of the counter-revolutionary restoration tide, Chairman Mao personally dispelled the heavy fog over the Qinghai Plateau and corrected the course of the cultural revolution in Qinghai, restoring the reputation of the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and making the conspiracy of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists completely fall apart. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai, the ranks of the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses have been restored and developed, and conservative organizations have collapsed. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they have inflicted on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The handful of reactionaries in Qinghai cannot escape this law; they are now surrounded by the revolutionary masses and have become rats that everyone wants to beat.

In the past four and a half months, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai has sent a large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, schools, rural areas, and offices, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to support the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses, making outstanding contributions and establishing immortal merits in executing the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." With the strong assistance of the army, the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Qinghai have launched a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in this region and unit. At the same time, through great criticism, they have promoted revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," creating extremely favorable conditions for the establishment of the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ of Qinghai Province.

At the celebration, Liu Xianquan, chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, gave a speech titled "Uphold Mao Zedong Thought and Build Qinghai into a Stronghold of Mao Zedong Thought." In his speech, he reviewed the arduous and complex struggle of the past year. He pointed out: Seizing power relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and holding power must also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We must not only be good at seizing power but also be good at holding power and using power, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. To keep the power seized by the proletarian revolutionary masses forever red, the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power well, that is, to listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Resolutely repel the enemy's sugar-coated bullets. Be good at guiding petty-bourgeois thinking onto the track of proletarian thinking, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Liu Xianquan pointed out that our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, issued a great call to the People's Liberation Army: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution," which is the greatest concern, greatest trust, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for the People's Liberation Army. Currently, the Qinghai Military Region and the troops stationed in Qinghai must resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call, continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly stand with the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses, fight shoulder to shoulder, and achieve new victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Liu Xianquan emphasized: After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the members of the Revolutionary Committee must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, and the power must be in the hands of those who hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must lead the revolution with Mao Zedong Thought, for the proletariat to hold power, for the people to hold power, and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, walking the socialist road. The members of the Revolutionary Committee must consciously transform their thinking, always act according to the teachings of Mao Zedong Thought. We must stand among the masses and remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be both an 'official' and a common people."

Comrade Liu Xianquan concluded: The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province who are loyal to Chairman Mao will definitely plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the summit of Kunlun Mountain and throughout every inch of the province, making the Qinghai Plateau forever shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Kang Jianmin, a responsible comrade of the Lanzhou Military Region, represented the entire army and troops of the Lanzhou Military Region to attend the celebration and extend warm congratulations on the birth of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. In his congratulatory speech, he said that the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great joy for the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai and the Northwest. This is the first triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that resounds through the clouds in our country's strategic rear area—the Northwest Plateau—following the "January Revolution" in Shanghai! He said that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai has enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses during the cultural revolution, firmly upheld Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely supported the "August 18" and all proletarian revolutionary masses in their struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the "three supports and two militaries" work, they have excellently completed their tasks. He concluded: We must always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and never forget class struggle. We must be ready at any time to give a resounding blow to the new challenges of the class enemy, thoroughly defeat their new counterattacks, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and launch a new high tide of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Qinghai, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Representatives of the "August 18" revolutionary rebel workers and students, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai, and revolutionary leading cadres spoke at the celebration. In their speeches, they enthusiastically congratulated the official establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and expressed their determination to spare no effort to consolidate and develop this victory. They emphasized that in the face of victory and the good situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution entering the stage of great criticism and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, the proletarian revolutionary masses must be modest and prudent, advance with the momentum of victory, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Qinghai. Through revolutionary great criticism, consolidate the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; at the same time, learn from the army, firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and resolutely unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight with them, and achieve victory with them, turning Qinghai into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives of the original Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sent by the Capital Red Guards also spoke at the celebration, extending warm congratulations on the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration received strong support from proletarian revolutionary masses across the country and the province. The meeting received many congratulatory telegrams and letters from across the country and the province.

The meeting, amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao.

The meeting read out the "Declaration to the People of the Province," solemnly announcing to the people of all ethnic groups in the province the official establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The "Declaration to the People of the Province" pointed out: The establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is "only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li." We must further launch a new high tide of the great criticism movement, launch a total attack and settlement against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Qinghai, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The "Declaration to the People of the Province" said: The great criticism of the revolution, fundamentally speaking, is to thoroughly criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology and thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois reactionary line; thoroughly establish and uphold Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly establish and uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In our minds, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The "Declaration to the People of the Province" called on the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province to immediately launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the source of the rivers, north and south of Kunlun, throughout China, and throughout the world, forever!

The "Declaration to the People of the Province" also called on the revolutionary masses of the province to better implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production," "be thrifty and make revolution," "resume classes and make revolution," and so on, making the various undertakings of socialist construction more prosperous.

The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee also issued its first notice on the same day. The notice said: The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is the highest temporary power organ of the province. From now on, all power of the Party, government, finance, and culture in Qinghai Province is entirely in the hands of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The notice called on the people of all ethnic groups in the province to actively support and maintain the leadership of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

After the meeting, a grand parade was held. (Accompanied by pictures)

    在伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀下　在革命大批判大斗争的高潮中
    青海省革命委员会宣告成立
    十二万军民隆重举行庆祝大会。在热烈的欢呼声中通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。“八·一八”等革命组织、人民解放军指战员和革命干部坚决表示：高举革命批判的大旗，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，创造出一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新青海。
    新华社西宁十二日电　在举国欢庆党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的喜庆日子里，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人进行革命大批判的高潮中，青海省无产阶级革命派实现了革命的大联合和“三结合”。八月十二日，由革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军驻青海地区部队代表、革命领导干部组成的青海省临时权力机构——青海省革命委员会诞生了。青海省无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线在青海高原的伟大胜利。
    十二日，高原古城西宁，红旗招展，万众欢腾。清晨，当旭日初升时，十二万无产阶级革命派战士、革命群众和全副武装的中国人民解放军指战员，高举红旗，抬着伟大领袖毛主席巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，英姿飒爽，涌向大会会场，隆重举行青海省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会。大会在《东方红》歌声中开始。大会主席、青海省革命委员会第一副主任张江霖同志在开会词中庄严宣告：青海省革命委员会正式成立了！顿时全场响起了热烈的欢呼声：“热烈欢呼青海省革命委员会成立！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    青海省革命委员会宣告成立，是青海省“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派英勇奋战取得的胜利成果。青海省内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争是十分尖锐、复杂的。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和反革命修正主义分子彭真、罗瑞卿之流，指使他们安插在青海的一小撮代理人，窃取了青海省党、政大权，妄图把青海省变成他们复辟资本主义的战略基地。这些年来，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，反对各族革命人民最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对工农群众活学活用毛主席著作。他们在各条战线推行了一整套修正主义路线，向无产阶级进行猖狂的进攻。在农村和牧区，他们大刮“三自一包”、“两定一奖”等妖风；在民族工作和统战工作中，大搞投降主义，极力扶植封建主义和资本主义势力。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们千方百计地抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，把许许多多的革命群众和革命干部打成“反革命”。“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派天不怕、地不怕，在白色恐怖中，他们豪迈地齐声高唱“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”，用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席的革命路线。在反革命复辟逆流的严重关头，毛主席亲手拨开了青海高原上空的重重迷雾、拨正了青海文化大革命的航船，为“八·一八”无产阶级革命派平了反，恢复了名誉，一小撮反革命修正主义分子的阴谋彻底破产了。在人民解放军驻青海支左部队大力支持下，“八·一八”无产阶级革命派队伍重新恢复和发展起来，保守组织纷纷土崩瓦解。正如伟大领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”青海省一小撮反动分子也逃不出这一规律，他们已处于革命群众包围之中，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。
    在过去四个多月的时间里，人民解放军驻青海地区部队派出了大批毛泽东思想宣传队深入工厂、学校、农村、机关，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想支援了“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派，在执行“三支”“两军”的光荣任务中，做出了卓越的贡献，建立了不朽的功勋。在解放军的大力协助下，青海省“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们在本地区本单位的代理人，进行了大揭露，大批判，大斗争。同时，通过大批判促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，为青海省的“三结合”临时权力机构的成立创造了极为有利的条件。
    在庆祝大会上，青海省革命委员会主任刘贤权作了题为《大立毛泽东思想，把青海建成为毛泽东思想的阵地》的讲话。他在讲话中回顾一年来艰巨复杂的斗争历程。他指出：夺权靠的是毛泽东思想，掌权也必须用毛泽东思想。我们不仅要善于夺权，而且要善于掌权和用权，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。要使无产阶级革命派夺过来的政权永远保持鲜红的颜色，最最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想来掌好权，用好权，就是要听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。坚决打退敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻。要善于把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级思想即毛泽东思想的轨道。刘贤权同志指出，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席向人民解放军发出伟大号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”，这是对人民解放军最大的关怀，最大的信赖，最大的鼓励，最大的鞭策。当前青海省军区和驻青海部队要坚决响应林副主席的号召，继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地和“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功。
    刘贤权同志着重指出：革命委员会成立后，在革命委员会成员头脑里一定要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，政权必须掌握在高举毛泽东思想红旗的人手中。一定要用毛泽东思想领导革命，为无产阶级掌权，为人民掌权，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，走社会主义道路。革命委员会成员要自觉地改造思想，处处事事以毛泽东思想为指针。要站到群众之中，牢记毛主席的教导：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”
    刘贤权同志最后说：忠于毛主席的“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派和全省各族革命人民，一定会把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插上昆仑山巅，插遍全省每一寸土地，使青海高原永远闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    中国人民解放军兰州部队负责人康健民同志代表兰州部队全体指战员到会热烈祝贺青海省革命委员会的诞生。他在贺词中说，青海省革命委员会的成立，是青海各族人民和西北人民的大喜事。这是继上海“一月革命”之后，在我们祖国的战略后方——西北高原上的第一支响彻云霄的毛泽东思想的凯歌！他说，驻青海地区人民解放军，在文化大革命中热烈响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，坚持了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决支持了“八·一八”和一切无产阶级革命派，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了针锋相对的斗争。在“三支”、“两军”工作中，出色地完成了任务。他最后说：我们必须时刻保持高度的革命警惕性，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，随时准备迎头痛击阶级敌人的新挑战，彻底打垮他们的新反扑，巩固无产阶级专政，掀起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派工人、学生，人民解放军驻青海地区部队和革命领导干部的代表，在庆祝大会上先后发言。他们在讲话中热烈欢呼青海省革命委员会正式成立，并表示今后要不遗余力地巩固和发展这个胜利。他们着重指出，在胜利面前，在无产阶级文化大革命进入大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的大好形势面前，无产阶级革命派要谦虚谨慎，乘胜前进，要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，狠斗党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在青海的代理人。通过革命的大批判，巩固革命的“三结合”；同时，要向解放军学习，坚定不移地相信和依靠人民解放军，坚决和人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把青海办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    首都红代会原赴青海毛泽东思想宣传队代表，也到会讲话，热烈祝贺青海省革命委员会成立。
    庆祝大会得到全国和全省各地无产阶级革命派的热烈支持。大会收到了来自全国和全省各地的许多贺电、贺信。
    大会在全场热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    大会宣读了《告全省人民书》，向全省各族人民庄严宣告青海省革命委员会正式成立。《告全省人民书》指出：青海省革命委员会的成立，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”我们必须进一步掀起大批判运动的新高潮，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人展开总攻击、总清算，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深、批透，斗倒、斗臭，彻底摧毁以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部。
    《告全省人民书》说：革命的大批判，从根本上说，就是大破特破资产阶级思想，大破特破资产阶级反动路线；大立特立毛泽东思想，大立特立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在我们的头脑里树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。《告全省人民书》号召“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和全省各族革命人民，立即掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在江河源头、昆仑南北，在全中国、全世界高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    《告全省人民书》还号召全省革命群众更好地贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”、“复课闹革命”等指示，使社会主义建设的各项事业进一步繁荣起来。
    青海省革命委员会当天还发出了第一号公告。公告说：青海省革命委员会是全省最高临时权力机构，自即日起，青海省党、政、财、文一切大权，全部归青海省革命委员会。公告号召全省各族人民积极支持和维护青海省革命委员会的领导。
    大会结束后，举行了声势浩大的游行。（附图片）
