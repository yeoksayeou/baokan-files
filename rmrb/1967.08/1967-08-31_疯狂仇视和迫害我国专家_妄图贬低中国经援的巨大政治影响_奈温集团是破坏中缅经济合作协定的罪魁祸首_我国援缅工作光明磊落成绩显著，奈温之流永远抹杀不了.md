In the process of implementing the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma, the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma has been playing a counter-revolutionary two-faced game of false friendship and true enmity. On the one hand, it wants to reap economic benefits from China's economic and technological aid; on the other hand, it has repeatedly violated the spirit of the agreement, denigrating the great political influence of China's aid, especially against Chinese experts who have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought, adopting various discriminatory, restrictive, slanderous, and even murderous fascist atrocities. This has completely destroyed the basic foundation for implementing the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two countries.

The Ne Win reactionary government's crimes of sabotaging the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma have reached their peak in the anti-China and anti-Chinese movement it orchestrated nationwide. It incited mobs to break into the Chinese Embassy in Burma, killing Chinese expert Liu Yi, creating one of the most horrifying fascist atrocities in the history of international relations. It organized and directed mobs to brutally attack the Chinese Embassy's Economic Counselor's Office, which was responsible for implementing Chinese aid projects in Burma, looting and burning Chinese aid materials and supplies for experts' work and living. It also attacked the Chinese experts' guesthouse in Rangoon. In anti-China rallies and gatherings it organized across Burma, it openly slandered Chinese experts as "spies." More seriously, it organized and directed mobs to hold anti-China demonstrations on Chinese aid construction sites, shouting anti-China slogans and shamelessly insulting the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. It dispatched Burmese reactionary military police to surround the living quarters of Chinese experts on various construction sites, and some Burmese reactionary troops even seized the offices of Chinese experts. It maliciously attempted to incite Burmese workers to oppose Chinese experts, creating pretexts for its persecution of Chinese experts. It also unreasonably obstructed Chinese experts who were on official business from returning to their construction sites in Rangoon. Currently, this serious situation is still developing, and Chinese experts have lost their freedom of movement and are in grave danger. All this has deprived Chinese experts of the conditions to continue their work.

The economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma was signed in 1961. The Chinese government, based on the principle of developing friendship between the two peoples, provided aid to Burma. Chinese experts in Burma, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, worked hard and selflessly, sharing weal and woe with the Burmese working people, and cooperating closely with them to quickly and efficiently carry out various aid projects, winning high praise from the Burmese people. Chinese experts have made their own contributions to the development of friendship between the two peoples.

However, the Ne Win fascist military clique, driven by its reactionary class nature, betrayed its promises and repeatedly unilaterally changed the agreed aid projects, causing serious difficulties in the implementation of the agreement and inflicting undeserved losses on China. The Dan Ren Light Tire Factory and the Keng Tung Hydropower Station are clear examples. These two projects were agreed upon by the Burmese side, and construction was to begin immediately. Chinese construction experts, technicians, and part of the materials and machinery had already arrived in Burma or were concentrated in China. The main production equipment for these two factories had also been manufactured in China and was ready for shipment. However, the Burmese side suddenly announced the suspension of construction. Under the stern questioning of the relevant authorities in China, the Ne Win clique had to admit that this was their "mistake."

The Ne Win reactionary government's attitude towards the agreement between the two countries is hypocritical and duplicitous. Burmese officials have repeatedly admitted to our personnel: "Compared with the aid from other countries, China's aid projects have the best quality and the fastest speed." However, fearing the great influence of China's aid, the Ne Win reactionary clique instructed newspapers to spread rumors and slander, maliciously defaming and attempting to denigrate our aid achievements. For example, the Keng Tung Bridge, which was completed in 1965, had excellent quality and was put into use ahead of schedule. The backfill part of the bridge naturally settled after one rainy season. The Chinese side had clearly explained this to the Burmese side during the handover. However, the Burmese "Guardian" newspaper maliciously spread rumors, saying that the bridge had "sunk." Even after our side protested, they did not correct the report. The Mittha Textile Factory was delayed by three months compared to the original plan due to the Burmese side's poor planning and preparation. The responsibility for the delay clearly lay with the Burmese side, but Burmese newspapers turned the facts upside down, falsely accusing the Chinese experts of "slow progress like a snail," maliciously shifting the blame onto the Chinese experts.

The Ne Win reactionary government's despicable actions in sabotaging the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two countries are concentrated in its hatred and persecution of Chinese experts, using methods that are unprecedented in the history of international relations. The Ne Win reactionary government dispatched a large number of spies disguised as various public figures to various construction sites to monitor Chinese experts. Under the pretext of protecting the safety of experts, it set up barbed wire around their living quarters, restricting their normal contact with the Burmese people, effectively turning the experts' living quarters into a disguised concentration camp. Even more intolerable is that the Burmese authorities colluded with Kuomintang spies, assigning them to infiltrate the construction sites to carry out sabotage. On the Keng Tung Bridge construction site, due to the exposure by Chinese experts, seven Kuomintang spies were caught, one of whom had stolen engineering drawings. In the collision incident at the Swar Plywood Factory construction site, one Chinese expert was seriously injured and died, and more than ten Chinese experts were injured. The Burmese government showed no reaction to such a major incident. The day after the deceased expert was buried, the Burmese reactionary government unreasonably demanded to exhume and move the body; the injured Chinese experts were hospitalized but received no medical treatment, causing them to suffer torture, and even the food that Chinese experts ate in the hospital was provided by local Chinese compatriots. This is a mad and inhuman form of persecution!

The Burmese reactionary government is extremely afraid of the great influence of China's economic aid in Burma and extremely afraid of the spread of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among Burmese workers and the profound influence of the great Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat on Burmese workers. Therefore, it has gone to great lengths to restrict Burmese workers from contacting Chinese experts. It has been scheming to carry out anti-China propaganda among Burmese workers, slandering Chinese experts as "coming to Burma to engage in political propaganda." It has implemented a series of reactionary measures on various construction sites, banning Burmese workers from reading Chairman Mao's works and wearing Chairman Mao badges, confiscating and expelling those who violate the rules, and dispatching a large number of spies to various construction sites for investigation and surveillance; banning Burmese workers and peasants from watching Chinese films; banning Burmese workers from seeing Chinese doctors on the construction sites; banning Burmese workers and Chinese experts' Chinese compatriot translators from contacting Chinese experts during non-production time; banning Burmese workers from welcoming Chinese experts at the station. At the same time, the Burmese reactionary authorities have been trying every means to restrict the freedom of movement of Chinese experts, such as not allowing Chinese experts to visit Burmese workers who were injured on duty, not allowing Chinese experts to invite Burmese workers to meals, and falsely claiming that according to Burmese customs, "guests cannot invite guests."

After arriving in Burma, Chinese experts carried forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, sharing weal and woe with the Burmese working people in their lives, winning universal praise from the Burmese working people. However, the Ne Win reactionary government, instead of repaying kindness with gratitude, has been discriminating against and harassing Chinese experts in their lives. According to the agreement, the Burmese side should supply living materials for Chinese experts, but they have never supplied them on time and in full. Under these circumstances, the living materials for Chinese experts have had to be mainly supplied from China. However, after the supplies arrived in Burma, they were often unreasonably delayed and could not be taken out in time. Moreover, these supplies were often subjected to organized theft by the Burmese side.

The Ne Win reactionary clique is the chief culprit in trampling on the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, sabotaging the relations between the two countries, and sabotaging the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two countries.

China's aid to Burma is open and aboveboard, with remarkable achievements, which the Ne Win clique cannot erase. The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is as deep as the mountains and as vast as the sea, with deep roots and lush leaves, which the Ne Win clique cannot destroy. The Ne Win clique's rampant anti-China farce has only exposed the true colors of the fake socialism, fake Sino-Burmese friendship, and fake neutrality it has been touting!

    疯狂仇视和迫害我国专家　妄图贬低中国经援的巨大政治影响
    奈温集团是破坏中缅经济合作协定的罪魁祸首
    我国援缅工作光明磊落成绩显著，奈温之流永远抹杀不了
    据新华社二十八日讯  本社记者报道：在执行中缅两国经济和技术合作协定的过程中，缅甸奈温反动政府一直玩弄假友好、真敌视的反革命两面手法。它一方面想从中国的经济和技术援助中捞取经济实惠；同时又不断违背协定精神，贬低中国经援所产生的巨大政治影响，特别是对用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家采取了百般歧视、限制、造谣中伤以至杀害的法西斯暴行。这就彻底地破坏了执行两国经济和技术合作协定的起码的基础。
  　奈温反动政府破坏中缅两国经济和技术合作协定的罪行，在它一手策划的遍及缅甸全国的反华排华运动中达到了登峰造极的程度。它纵容暴徒越墙冲入中国驻缅甸大使馆刺杀了中国援缅专家刘逸，制造了国际关系史上最骇人听闻的法西斯暴行。它组织和指挥暴徒野蛮地袭击了中国援缅工程的执行机构——中国大使馆经济参赞处，抢劫和焚烧了我国援缅工程的器材和供专家使用的工作、生活用品；同时还袭击了在仰光的中国专家招待所驻地。它在缅甸各地策划的反华游行和集会中，公然污蔑中国专家是“间谍”。更为严重的是，它组织和指挥暴徒在中国援缅工地上向中国专家进行反华“示威”，狂叫反华口号，肆无忌惮地侮辱中国人民最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。它派出缅甸反动军警包围了各工地的中国专家住处，有的工地上的缅甸反动军队甚至强占了中国专家的办公室。它别有用心地企图煽动缅甸工人反对中国专家，为其迫害中国专家制造口实。它还无理阻挠因公前往仰光的各建筑工地的中国专家返回工地。目前，这一严重局势还在继续发展，中国专家已失去了行动自由，安全毫无保障。这一切，就使中国专家失去了继续工作的条件。
    中缅经济和技术合作协定是一九六一年签订的。中国政府本着发展两国人民友谊的立场，对缅甸给予了援助。援缅的中国专家按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，艰苦奋斗，忘我劳动，同缅甸劳动人民同甘共苦，亲密协作，又快、又好地从事各项援助工程的建设工作，博得了缅甸人民的高度赞扬。中国专家为发展中缅两国人民的友谊做出了自己的贡献。
    可是，奈温法西斯军人集团从它反动的阶级本性出发，背信弃义，不断片面地变更预定的援助项目，对协定的执行造成严重困难，并使中国蒙受了不应有的损失。丹仁光轮胎厂、滚弄水电站就是明显的例证。这两个项目，缅方已经同意了中国设计，并决定立即动工。中国基建专家、技术人员以及部分材料、机械已经到达缅甸，或者在中国国内集中。这两个厂的主要生产设备也已经在中国国内制成待运。但是，缅方却突然宣布停建，在我有关当局的严正质问下，奈温集团不得不承认，这是他们的“过错”。
    奈温反动政府对待两国协议的态度是口蜜腹剑，两面三刀。缅甸官员在我方人员面前多次承认：“对比各国的援助，中国经援项目质量最好，速度最快”。但是，害怕中国经援的巨大影响的奈温反动集团，却指使报纸造谣中伤，恶意诋毁，妄图贬低我援助成果。例如，一九六五年建成的滚弄桥，质量优良，提前通车。这座桥的回填土部分经过一个雨季之后发生了正常的自然沉陷。中国方面在交工时曾向缅方作过明确的交代。但是，缅甸《卫报》在报道中却恶意造谣，说什么桥梁“下沉”。我方对此提出抗议之后，仍不更正。密铁那纺织厂，由于缅方计划不周，准备不足，动工日期比原计划推迟了三个月。推迟责任明明全在缅方，缅方报纸却颠倒是非，倒打一耙，胡说什么“工程进度象蜗牛爬行一样的缓慢”，恶意嫁祸于中国专家。
    奈温反动政府破坏两国经济和技术合作协定的卑劣行径，集中地表现在对中国专家的仇视和迫害，手段之卑鄙恶毒是国际关系史上前所未见的。奈温反动政府派出大批特务伪装成各种公开身份的人员到各工地，监视中国专家。它以保护专家安全为借口，在专家住处设置铁丝网，限制他们同缅甸人民的正常往来，实际上把专家住处变成了变相的集中营。更加不能容忍的是，缅甸当局竟然同蒋帮特务相勾结，指派他们混入工地，进行阴谋破坏。在滚弄桥工地上，由于中国专家的揭露就抓出了七个蒋帮特务，其中一人已经盗窃了工程图纸。在斯瓦胶合板厂工地发生的撞车事件中，有一名中国专家受重伤牺牲，十多名中国专家受伤，缅甸政府对这样的重大事件毫无表示，牺牲的专家埋葬后的第二天，缅甸反动政府竟无理地要扒坟移墓；中国受伤专家进了医院后，竟连医药都没有，让他们遭受痛苦折磨，甚至中国专家在医院吃的饭也是由当地华侨供给。这是丧心病狂的变相迫害！
    缅甸反动政府极端害怕中国经济援助在缅甸所产生的巨大影响，极端害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想在缅甸工人中的传播和伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命在缅甸工人中所产生的深远影响，因而千方百计地限制缅甸工人同中国专家接触。它处心积虑地在缅甸工人中进行反华宣传，污蔑中国专家是“到缅甸搞政治宣传的”。它在各个建设工地上推行了一系列反动措施，不准缅甸工人读毛主席著作和佩戴毛主席像章，违者没收、开除，并派大批特务到各工地进行调查和监视；不准缅甸工农群众看中国电影；不准缅甸工人找工地上的中国医生看病；不准缅甸工人和中国专家的华侨翻译在非生产时间同中国专家接触；不准缅甸工人到车站迎送中国专家。同时，缅甸反动当局还想方设法限制中国专家的行动自由，如不准中国专家探望因公负伤的缅甸工人，不准中国专家请缅甸工人吃饭，胡说什么根据缅甸的习惯“客人是不能请客人的”。
    中国专家到了缅甸以后，发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，在生活上和缅甸劳动人民同甘苦，博得了缅甸劳动人民的普遍赞扬。可是，奈温反动政府却以怨报德，在生活上对中国专家竭力进行歧视和刁难。按照协定应由缅方供应中国专家的生活物资，从未如期按量地供应。在这种情况下，中国专家的生活物资不得不主要靠国内供应。可是供应品到达缅甸后，多次被无理刁难，不能及时取出。而且，这些供应品还经常受到缅方有组织的盗窃。
    奈温反动统治集团是践踏中缅两国人民友谊、破坏两国关系、破坏两国经济和技术合作协定的罪魁祸首。
    中国援缅工作，光明磊落，成绩显著，这是奈温之流所抹杀不了的。中缅两国人民的友谊山高海深，根深叶茂，这也是奈温之流所破坏不了的。奈温集团猖狂反华的大丑剧，只不过使它所标榜的假社会主义、假中缅友好和假中立的原形毕露而已！
