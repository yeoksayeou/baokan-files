According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 2nd, our correspondent reports: Just as the Soviet revisionist clique is in an unprecedented predicament due to betraying the interests of the Arab people and the people of the world, the ancestor of modern revisionism and great traitor Khrushchev suddenly appeared to deliver a television "talk," extensively glorifying American imperialism, covering up the Soviet revisionists' capitulationist foreign policy, and viciously attacking China, opposing Marxism-Leninism. This is a farce carefully arranged by the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique out of their current political needs.

Khrushchev's "talk" was directed at a so-called Soviet "reporter" who writes specifically for Western bourgeois newspapers. After this "talk" was published, it was sold at a high price to the American National Broadcasting Company through this "reporter" along with the related television footage he shot. Many newspapers in the United States, Britain, West Germany, and other countries, as if they had found a treasure, all published this "talk" in detail in prominent positions.

In his "talk," Khrushchev praised the bloodthirsty war monger Eisenhower as a "good person." He praised the great schemer Kennedy, who is adept at playing both ends against the middle in counter-revolutionary strategies, as a "true statesman" with the ability to "resolve international conflicts through negotiations." He also praised Johnson, who intensified aggression and expansion in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as a man who "keeps his promises," and so on. Khrushchev's effort to glorify these American imperialist leaders in this "talk" is to cover up his own traitorous face, especially that of Brezhnev and Kosygin, who collude with American imperialism to betray the interests of the people of the world.

Khrushchev talked at length about the 1962 Caribbean crisis, using every means to defend the Soviet revisionists' policy of surrender and betrayal in this crisis, portraying himself as the "victor" of the Caribbean crisis. It is truly shameful!

Khrushchev viciously attacked the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, who is the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world. He distorted Mao's speeches, slandering Mao's profound judgments about war and peace, about atomic bombs being paper tigers, and about the people, not a few new weapons, determining the outcome of the war. He continued to advocate nuclear terror, repeating the nonsense that "a few" atomic bombs are enough to turn tens of thousands of people into "ashes." This is an attempt to resist the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought worldwide, to intimidate the oppressed peoples and nations of the world with nuclear blackmail, and to hinder them from rising up to wage armed struggles against imperialism and their own reactionaries.

Khrushchev also attacked the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin. Khrushchev's attack on Stalin again is to continue to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, oppose the socialist system, and oppose the great Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

Khrushchev's appearance this time to deliver a political talk is not accidental. This greatest revisionist, due to pushing revisionism domestically and internationally, has made himself internally and externally besieged, unable to continue, and was ousted from the political stage in October 1964. Over the past two years, his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, have been consistently pushing the Khrushchev revisionist line without Khrushchev. In this Middle East incident, their treacherous deeds of betraying the Arab people are even more shameless and disgraceful than Khrushchev's despicable actions during the Caribbean crisis. It is precisely the Soviet revisionists' policy of complete surrender and betrayal that has made them infamous, isolated as never before, and strongly condemned and opposed domestically and internationally. Their internal struggles and infighting are intensifying, and their days are getting harder. It is under these circumstances that they let Khrushchev come out and speak his mind to help with their political and diplomatic needs. However, Khrushchev couldn't even keep his own "throne," so how can he save his disciples?!

    苏修领导集团内外交困日子难过
    抬出赫鲁晓夫大演联美反华丑剧
    据新华社二日讯　本社记者报道：正当苏修集团由于叛卖阿拉伯人民和世界人民的利益而陷入空前困境的时候，现代修正主义祖师爷、大叛徒赫鲁晓夫，突然出面发表电视“谈话”，大肆美化美帝国主义，粉饰苏修投降主义的外交政策，并且恶毒地攻击中国，大反马克思列宁主义。这是勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团出于当前政治上的需要而精心安排的一场丑剧。
    赫鲁晓夫这篇“谈话”，是对一个所谓专门为西方资产阶级报刊撰稿的苏联“记者”发表的。这篇“谈话”发表后，便通过这个“记者”连同他所拍摄的有关电视纪录片，以高价出售给美国全国广播公司。美国、英国、西德等国的许多报刊如获至宝，都在显著地位详尽地刊登了这篇“谈话”。
    赫鲁晓夫在“谈话”中吹捧嗜血成性的大战争贩子艾森豪威尔是什么“好人”。他赞扬擅长玩弄反革命两手策略的大阴谋家肯尼迪是什么“真正的政治家”，“有着通过谈判解决国际冲突的才能”。他还吹捧变本加厉地在亚非拉地区实行侵略和扩张的大冒险家约翰逊是什么“信守”“诺言”的人，等等。赫鲁晓夫在这次“谈话”中拚命美化这些美帝头子，就是为了掩盖他自己、特别是勃列日涅夫和柯西金同美帝进行反革命勾结，出卖世界人民利益的叛徒面目。
    赫鲁晓夫大谈特谈一九六二年加勒比海危机，千方百计为苏修在这场危机中执行的投降叛卖政策辩护，把自己打扮成为加勒比海危机的“胜利者”，真不知人间有羞耻事！
    赫鲁晓夫恶毒地攻击当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、中国人民和全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛泽东主席。他肆意歪曲毛主席的谈话，诋毁毛主席关于战争与和平，关于原子弹是纸老虎，决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器的英明论断。他继续宣扬核恐怖，重弹什么“一两个”原子弹就足以使成千上万的人“化为灰烬”的滥调。这是妄图对抗光焰无际的毛泽东思想在全世界的伟大影响，用核讹诈吓唬全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族，阻挠他们起来进行反对帝国主义和本国反动派的武装斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫还攻击伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林。赫鲁晓夫再一次跳出来攻击斯大林，就是要继续反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义制度，反对伟大的苏联和苏联人民。
    赫鲁晓夫这次以“在野”身份出来发表政治性谈话，决不是偶然的。这个最大的修正主义者，由于在国内外推行修正主义，弄得内外交困，无法再混下去，在一九六四年十月被赶下政治舞台。两年多来，他的继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，一直推行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线。在这次中东事件中，他们干下的叛卖阿拉伯人民的罪恶勾当，比赫鲁晓夫当年在加勒比海危机中的丑恶行径，更加无耻和丢人。正是苏修集团的全面投降叛卖政策，使他们声名狼藉，空前孤立，在国内外遭到强烈的谴责和反对。他们内部的倾轧和斗争正在加剧，日子越来越不好过了。就是在这种情况下，他们让赫鲁晓夫抛头露面，大放厥词，来为他们的政治上和外交上的需要帮忙。但是，赫鲁晓夫连自己的“宝座”都保不住，又怎么能够救得了他的门徒呢？！
