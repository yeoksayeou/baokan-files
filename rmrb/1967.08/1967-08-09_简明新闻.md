    People in Some U.S. Cities Hold Demonstrations Against the War in Vietnam

    Jerusalem (Arab District) People Hold General Strike

    The people of Jerusalem (Arab District) held a general strike on August 7 to resist the occupation by U.S.-Israeli aggressors.

    Due to the general strike, the Israeli-occupied Jerusalem (Arab District) was paralyzed. Except for three bakeries, all shops were closed, and no one went out to work. Local people from all walks of life responded to the call of the "Committee for the Defense of Arab Jerusalem" and participated in the general strike. The organization's leaflets also called on Arab residents to refuse to pay taxes to the Israeli occupation authorities.

    The people of another occupied city in the West Bank, Nablus, fully supported the general strike in Jerusalem (Arab District) and protested against Israel's occupation of Arab land and its aggressive ambition to annex Jerusalem (Arab District).

    Ecuadorian Working-Class Children Denied the Right to Education

    Under U.S. imperialist rule in Ecuador, education has become a class privilege, and the children of the broad masses of workers are excluded from school gates.

    According to official materials recently published by Ecuadorian newspapers, out of 33,500 primary school children, only 11,300 graduated from the sixth grade. This means that two-thirds of the primary school students were forced to drop out midway.

    Out of 10,642 students in the first year of secondary school, only 1,323 graduated from the sixth grade.

    Out of 1,085 youths who entered the first year of university, only 262 completed their studies.
