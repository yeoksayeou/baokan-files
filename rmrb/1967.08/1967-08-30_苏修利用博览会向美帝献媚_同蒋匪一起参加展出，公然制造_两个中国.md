The Soviet revisionist clique participated in the World Export Fair currently being held in Montreal, Canada. The fair began in late April and will conclude in October. Among the participating countries, the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, France, and others hold the dominant positions. Apart from promoting goods, the fair vigorously propagates the decadent lifestyle of the Western bourgeoisie. The U.S. and the Soviet Union also seized this opportunity to extensively advocate for "peaceful coexistence" and "U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

The organizers deliberately placed the American pavilion and the Soviet pavilion next to each other and, with great effort, constructed a "cosmic bridge" over a small river separating them. It is not difficult to see that this is intended to symbolize Johnson's "bridge-building" policy. The Soviet revisionist clique understood this well. Soviet revisionist publications took the opportunity to extensively praise the fair as an "excellent opportunity to exchange flowers" and shamelessly boasted: "This bridge connects the two most powerful countries in the world, and they have the right to be proud of bravely entering space."

The First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Poliansky, personally went to Montreal to cheer for the fair. He obsequiously praised the fair's slogan "Man and His World" and took this bourgeois slogan as the banner of the Soviet revisionists. He said, "This slogan left a deep impression on us because our country is advocating and practicing the principle of 'everything for man, everything for man's happiness.'"

Poliansky revealed to his American masters: "Communism is the struggle for the moral purity, physical health, and comprehensive development of the individual, and for each person to have abundant material wealth and spiritual culture." This is equivalent to saying that the "communism" of the Soviet revisionist clique is modeled after the United States and aims to establish a capitalism similar to that of the United States. This point was further explained by a Soviet revisionist newspaper: "Visitors to the exhibition will learn in the pavilion of the largest American monopoly what kind of refrigerators people will use tomorrow, in the British pavilion they will see what kind of parks there are for rest, and in the French exhibition they will learn what kind of cosmetics women will use in the future."

It is worth noting that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits also participated in this fair. The Soviet revisionist clique's participation in the exhibition with the Chiang bandits is another ironclad evidence of their collusion with the U.S. to oppose China and create "two Chinas."

    苏修利用博览会向美帝献媚
    同蒋匪一起参加展出，公然制造“两个中国”
    本报讯　苏修集团参加了正在加拿大蒙特利尔举行的世界出口博览会。这个博览会从四月底开始，将于十月结束。在参加展出的国家中，美、苏、英、法等国占有主要地位。博览会除了推销商品以外，还竭力宣扬西方资产阶级的腐朽生活方式。美苏并且利用这个机会，大肆鼓吹“和平共处”，“美苏合作”。
    博览会的组织者特意把美国馆和苏联馆安排为邻居，并且挖空心思，在隔开它们的一条小河上搭起一座“宇宙桥”。人们不难看出，这是有意要把约翰逊的“搭桥”政策加以形象化。苏修集团对此心领神会。苏修报刊借机大肆宣扬博览会是“彼此互送鲜花的极好机会”，还无耻吹嘘：“这座桥把世界上两个最强大的国家连接起来，它们有资格为勇敢地进入宇宙空间而感到骄傲。”
    苏联部长会议第一副主席波利扬斯基，还亲自跑到蒙特利尔，为博览会捧场喝采。他肉麻地赞扬博览会的口号“人和他的世界”，并把这个资产阶级的口号接过来，做为苏修自己的旗帜。他说，这个口号“给我们留下了深刻印象，因为我国正在宣传并在实践中实现‘一切为了人，一切为了人的幸福’的原则。”
    波利扬斯基向美国主子交底：共产主义就是“为人的道德纯洁、体格健全、个性全面发展、每个人都有丰富的物质财富和精神文化而奋斗。”这等于是说，苏修集团的“共产主义”是以美国为蓝图的，是要建立象美国那样的资本主义。这一点，一家苏修报纸作了进一步的说明：“展览会的参观者在美国最大的垄断组织的馆里会知道，明天人类将使用什么样的冰箱，在英国馆里将看到休息的公园是什么样子，法国展品说明，妇女们将来使用什么样的化妆品。”      
    值得注意的是，蒋介石匪帮也参加了这次博览会。苏修集团与蒋匪帮一起参加展出，是他们联美反华，制造“两个中国”的又一铁的罪证。
