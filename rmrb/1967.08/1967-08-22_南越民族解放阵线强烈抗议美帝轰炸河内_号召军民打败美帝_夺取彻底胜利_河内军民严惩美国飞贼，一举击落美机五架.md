The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly protests the U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi and calls on the military and people to defeat the U.S. and achieve a complete victory. The people of Hanoi severely punish the American bandits, shooting down five U.S. planes in one go.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on the 14th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists for sending planes to bomb and strafe the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, as well as the areas of Ha Bac, Hai Duong, Lang Son, and Nghe An on August 11, 12, and 13.

The statement said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully supports the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 12, and once again warns the U.S. imperialists that any "escalation" of their actions against North Vietnam will not save them from defeat in the war in South Vietnam and will absolutely not shake the resolve of the heroic capital and the people of the North to resist the Americans and save the country.

The statement said that in the face of the U.S. imperialists' crazy expansion of the war and their extremely barbaric new crimes against the people of North and South Vietnam, in order to achieve true independence, freedom, and peace, the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front are determined to fight resolutely and achieve victory.

The statement finally calls on all the military and people of South Vietnam to carry forward the revolutionary spirit, establish more glorious battle achievements in this rainy season and the upcoming winter and spring, and together with the military and people of the whole country, defeat the U.S. aggressors' war of invasion and ultimately achieve a complete victory.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 21st, U.S. bandit planes launched four savage attacks on the central and suburban residential areas of Hanoi on the 21st. The well-prepared military and people of Hanoi, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, immediately struck back, shooting down five enemy planes, damaging several, and killing and capturing many American bandits.

After the people of Hanoi shot down five U.S. planes on the 21st, the military and people of North Vietnam achieved the great victory of shooting down 2,200 U.S. planes since August 5, 1964.
