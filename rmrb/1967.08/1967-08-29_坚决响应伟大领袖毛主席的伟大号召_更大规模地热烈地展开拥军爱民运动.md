The proletarian revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and People's Liberation Army in the capital and Shanghai have held discussions and studied the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. They have unanimously decided to formulate agreements on supporting the army and loving the people, and to further unite closely to launch a high tide of criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on August 28, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army today enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on launching a larger-scale patriotic support-the-army and love-the-people movement. They pointed out with great pride that the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country can proceed smoothly because of the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great People's Liberation Army, which is absolutely loyal, loves, and worships Chairman Mao. To push the cultural revolution forward and achieve more brilliant victories, it is necessary for the military and the people to unite more closely and launch a larger-scale, enthusiastic patriotic support-the-army and love-the-people movement. They firmly declared that in this great movement, they will definitely be the vanguard and model of supporting the army and loving the people.

Today, many proletarian revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary youngsters in various factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions in the capital, while discussing and studying the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, reviewed their experiences of fighting side by side with the People's Liberation Army over the past year. They deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army is the people's own army, and the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the people is as close as flesh and blood, and as inseparable as fish and water. They take on all responsibilities to cherish all proletarian revolutionaries, all Red Guards, and all revolutionary masses. They are truly the great army created, led, and commanded by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the great support for defending the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Capital Steel Company, Beijing Water Supply Company, Shijingshan Power Plant, and North China Metal Structure Factory said that in the previous stage, every progress we made in the great proletarian cultural revolution was inseparable from the support of the great People's Liberation Army. They unanimously declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," always believe in, support, and rely on the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and help the People's Liberation Army do an even better job in the "three supports and two militaries" work. Under the help of the army, they will be models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the suburbs of Beijing and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army executing agricultural support tasks discussed the combat friendship established between the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary masses in the sharp and complex class struggle. They decided to further strengthen unity, learn from each other, support each other, and fight shoulder to shoulder to unswervingly execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launching a high tide of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The Red Guards who have fought their way out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line have a deeper understanding of the great truth that "without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The revolutionary youngsters of the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, who are undergoing military and political training, regard military training as a great opportunity to learn from the People's Liberation Army. They declared that they would definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly believe in, rely on, and learn from the People's Liberation Army, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and absolutely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

The leadership of the Beijing Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army requires all officers and soldiers of the subordinate units to seriously study and actively propagate the spirit of the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily; requires the officers and soldiers undertaking the glorious tasks of the "three supports and two militaries" to widely solicit opinions from the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, and formulate new agreements on loving the people. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers firmly declared that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and in defending the cultural revolution and executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks, achieve new merits for the people. The officers and soldiers of the First Company of a certain unit born in Jinggangshan in 1928 said, "Our army, from the day it was born to the present, has never been separated from the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the love and support of the people. In this new revolutionary historical period, we will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people' and swear to be models of loving the people." The officers and soldiers guarding Chairman Mao also discussed and deliberated on the formulation of new agreements on loving the people during their study.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on August 28, the birthplace of the January revolutionary storm, Shanghai, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai's land, sea, and air forces enthusiastically welcomed the editorials published by the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on launching the patriotic support-the-army and love-the-people movement. They jointly declared: resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, forever hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," the military and the people forever trust, cherish, support, and learn from each other, unite closely, and fight shoulder to shoulder to decisively win the thorough victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution!

The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," formulated an agreement on supporting the army and loving the people. The agreement points out that the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai are the strongest backing for the proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai and the most reliable and powerful pillar of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. They have made immortal contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work. All revolutionary people in the city must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, most resolutely believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in doing a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army should take on all responsibilities to cherish the proletarian revolutionary masses, cherish the Red Guards, and cherish the revolutionary masses, and listen to the opinions of the masses. The agreement also requires all proletarian revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and various revolutionary mass organizations in the city to strongly support the People's Liberation Army's war preparedness work, while maintaining a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, to prevent bad elements from stirring up military-civilian relations and support the revolutionary measures taken by the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Today, the revolutionary masses in many factories and enterprises in Shanghai, while studying Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," reviewed with excited hearts the glorious course of fighting side by side with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army over the past year. They said: The current great criticism in Shanghai has entered a new high tide, and revolutionary great unity has made new leaps. The situation is excellent and getting better and better! These achievements are inseparable from the full support of the great People's Liberation Army, which was created, led, and directly commanded by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

More than 20 large and medium-sized schools in Shanghai held a grand and enthusiastic meeting this morning with representatives of the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai, who have made outstanding contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work, to celebrate the publication of the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily.

The officers and soldiers of the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai, with hearts full of love for Chairman Mao, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the army and loving the people." Some sent propaganda teams to propagate the strategic significance of launching the patriotic support-the-army and love-the-people movement among the revolutionary masses in the stationed areas during the cultural revolution. Some used methods such as visiting door-to-door and inviting revolutionary leftists and revolutionary masses to discuss, widely soliciting opinions from the masses. Many units' officers and soldiers also discussed the significance of "supporting the army and loving the people" in conjunction with the criticism of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They proudly pointed out that the current launch of a large-scale patriotic support-the-army and love-the-people movement is a new mobilization order issued by Chairman Mao to all officers and soldiers and the proletarian revolutionary masses across the country, a great strategic measure to promote the great proletarian cultural revolution to victory, and a great driving force to win new victories in the cultural revolution. They are determined to resolutely execute, forever execute, and strive to be models of "loving the people."

Today, the Party committees of the three armed forces stationed in Shanghai issued calls, requiring all officers and soldiers to firmly, unmistakably, and wholeheartedly support the revolutionary leftists, requiring all officers and soldiers to more humbly learn from the revolutionary leftists and Red Guards, establish deep class feelings with them, requiring all officers and soldiers to better follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "persisting in what is good for the people and correcting what is wrong for the people," humbly listen to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, and strive to overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in the leftist support work; also requiring all officers and soldiers to heighten vigilance, strengthen war preparedness, and be ready at any time to thoroughly smash all sabotage and armed provocations by class enemies, defend the motherland, and defend the great proletarian cultural revolution.
