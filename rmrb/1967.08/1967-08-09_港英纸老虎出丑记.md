	Recently, the British Hong Kong authorities mobilized thousands of fascist military police, with guns loaded and bayonets drawn, fangs bared and claws out, day and night, to raid, loot, arrest, and beat our patriotic compatriots. They thought that by using violence, they could suppress the patriotic struggle against violence.

	"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Boom! Boom! Boom! The sound of explosions in resistance to violence echoed through Hong Kong and Kowloon. In less than a month, the British Hong Kong police stations and institutions had been bombed many times. The explosions made the British Hong Kong authorities uneasy, frightened, and jumpy, seeing danger in every bush and tree.

	In recent days, our patriotic compatriots have cleverly set up traps, with real and fake "suspicious" "explosives" everywhere, making the British Hong Kong authorities dizzy and unable to cope. As long as there is a small tin can, a small paper box, a paper doll, or even a broken shoe on the side of the road, the British military police will be terrified, immediately sending "explosives experts" to the scene for inspection, truly showing their ugly side.

	On the morning of July 26, a three-foot-tall paper doll appeared on a lamppost in the busy district of Central Hong Kong. Immediately, teams of "riot control units," plainclothes agents, and ambulances all rushed to the scene, surrounding and sealing off a large area of Central. After the "army" had finished setting up their defenses, a British "explosives expert" appeared. He was dressed in a strange and peculiar bulletproof vest made of steel plates, with his arms stretched out and unable to move, standing under the paper doll, looking around for forty-five minutes before deciding to climb up using a platform and ladder. He first conducted "scientific detection," then used scissors to cut the string on the paper doll's "head." The "explosives expert" cut once and looked around in panic, taking twenty minutes to cut all the strings from the paper doll's head to its feet.

	The tense "dissection" work began. First, the "head" was dissected, revealing only old newspapers. Then, it took another ten minutes to dissect the "waist," again finding only old newspapers. Hundreds of "soldiers" had been busy for more than two hours but found not a trace of "explosives." The British Hong Kong authorities were so frightened by a three-foot-long paper doll, showing such ugly behavior, that the onlookers around laughed heartily and commented that this was the British "paper tiger" showing its true colors.

	Another day, a small paper box appeared next to the "Friendship Bank" in Central Hong Kong. The British military police were terrified again, quickly calling in the "riot control units." They were all armed to the teeth, nervously watching the dreadful small paper box from a distance. The "explosives expert" was called in again, wearing a bulletproof vest and holding a mine detector, cautiously pondering over the paper box. After a long time, he carefully removed a piece of newspaper from the box, revealing a plastic bag inside. The "explosives expert" stared at it for a while before trembling hands took out the bag, revealing it to be a bag of garbage. The ugly behavior of the British "paper tiger" was once again exposed to the public.

	In the Kwun Tong district of Kowloon, on the morning of July 28, a "magical" paper bag appeared, and a large group of British military police surrounded the paper bag, shouting in front and behind for five hours. Four British soldiers held instruments and moved them around the paper bag, measuring and probing from left to right, finally "confirming" it to be a "heavy bomb" that needed to be ignited to explode. Thus, the "riot control units" exerted all their strength, moving sandbags back and forth, building a sandbag barrier around the "magical" paper bag. When the "explosives expert" was about to ignite it, someone in the crowd shouted "Boom! Boom!" and others shouted "Bang!" Some children made whistling sounds, making the "experts" even more shaky and embarrassed.

	The "magical" paper bag was lit, and a puff of blue smoke rose, followed by a sound like a firecracker exploding, causing the onlookers to burst into laughter.

    港英纸老虎出丑记
    前些时，港英当局出动成百上千的法西斯军警，枪弹上膛，刺刀出鞘，张牙舞爪，夜以继日地向我爱国同胞进行搜劫捕打，自以为用暴力就可以把爱国同胞的抗暴斗争镇压下去。
    “人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。”轰！轰！轰！抗暴的爆炸声在港九各地炸响了！不到一个月，港英的警署和机构已经挨了好多次的炸。炸得港英坐卧不安，心惊胆战，草木皆兵。
    最近几天，爱国同胞更是巧妙布阵，真真假假，到处都是“可疑”的“爆炸品”，弄得港英蒙头转向，应接不暇。只要在路旁放上一个小铁罐、一个小纸盒、一个纸人，甚至一只破皮鞋，港英军警见了都毛骨悚然，立即派出“军火专家”到现场检验，真是丑态百出。
    七月二十六日上午，在香港中区闹市的一根灯柱上，出现了一个高约三尺的纸人。立即一队队的“防暴队”、便衣特务，加上救伤车，一齐开到现场，把中区大片地区包围封锁起来。待“大军”布防完毕，一名英国“军火专家”出场了，只见他穿戴上稀奇古怪的钢片避弹衣，双臂伸展不灵，转动不便，站在纸人下，东张西望，整整呆看了四十五分钟，才决定架台叠凳爬上去。他先实行“科学探测”，然后用剪刀剪断纸人“头”部的绳子。“军火专家”剪一下就慌张地望一下，足足花了二十多分钟，才把纸人从头到脚的绳子剪去。
    紧张的“解剖”工作开始了。先是“头”部解剖，发现全是些旧报纸。再花十分钟进行“腰部”解剖，又是些旧报纸。数百“大军”折腾了两个多小时，连“爆炸品”的影子也找不到。港英当局对一个三尺长的纸人怕得如此丑态百出，引得四周观众捧腹大笑，纷纷议论这是港英“纸老虎”大现原形。
    又一天，香港中区美国“友邦银行”旁边，出现了一个小纸盒。港英军警又吓坏了，连忙把“防暴队”调来，他们个个荷枪实弹，提心吊胆地远远望着那个可怕的小纸盒，“军火专家”又被召来了，他穿上避弹衣，拿着探雷器，战战兢兢地对着纸盒思索揣摩。过了好一会，他才小心翼翼地揭去盒子上的一张报纸，里面露出了一个胶袋来。“军火专家”又凝视了好一会，才颤手颤脚地把胶袋拿起来，原来是一包垃圾。港英纸老虎的丑态又一次暴露在广众之前。
    在九龙观塘区，二十八日晨出现一个“神奇”的纸袋，一大群港英军警围着纸袋前后喧嚷了五个小时。四名英军拿着仪器朝纸袋转来转去，左测测右探探，最后“确认”是一个“重型的炸弹”，需要引火爆炸。于是，“防暴队”出尽力气，来回搬运沙包，在“神奇”的纸袋周围筑起沙包阵。当“军火专家”准备引火时，观众中有人大叫“爆啦！爆啦！”有人高叫“轰！”有些小孩子则发出嘘声，弄得那些“专家”更是手颤脚抖，窘态毕露。
    “神奇”纸袋点着了，一股蓝烟冒起，继而发出一声鞭炮一样的“爆炸”声，引得围观群众一阵大笑。
