The Chinese embassies in Syria, Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and Yemen held receptions on July 31 and August 1 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Arab friends who attended the receptions highly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was founded by Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They said that the PLA is not only the guardian of China's security but also the strongest pillar in the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Arab friends expressed their deep love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They eagerly requested copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Mao Zedong's Military Writings," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges from the Chinese embassies.

One hundred and sixty people attended the reception held by the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Syria, Major General Yan Ling, on the evening of July 31. Among them were Syrian Minister of War Awad Bajji, Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Ahmad Murad, Minister of Planning Hamid Hassan, Minister of Higher Education Wafik Shahid, Deputy Chief of Air Force Asad Muhayyad, Commander of the Middle East Region Mustafa Tarash, and Commander of the Palestine Liberation Army in Syria, Lieutenant General Razzak Yahya.

At the reception, Syrian friends highly evaluated Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and the military line he established for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They pointed out that the PLA is the main force in the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of the world. Syrian friends also thanked China for its resolute support for the struggle of the Arab people against Zionism. They said, "The peoples of China and Syria are comrades-in-arms in the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism." The reception concluded with the screening of the Chinese film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

A grand reception was held by the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Algeria, Hu Binpu, on the evening of August 1. Among the attendees were Algerian Chief of the General Staff Tahar Zbir, Commander of the National Gendarmerie Ben Sherif, Director of the Political Department of the National People's Army Hashimi, and other high-ranking Algerian government officials.

An Algerian military officer said at the reception, "Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary and the greatest military strategist. We read and used Chairman Mao's works during the Algerian National Liberation War, and today we must study Chairman Mao's works even more deeply." A student from the Algerian Military Academy praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army as "a true people's army."

More than five hundred Iraqi guests attended the reception held by the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Baghdad, Hou Jianye, on August 1. Among them were Iraqi Minister of Industry Khalil Ibrahim, Deputy Chief of Staff Abdul Kadir Yasin Alani, and Director of the Presidential Office Badiya Sharif.

At the reception, an Iraqi friend enthusiastically said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is not only the guardian of China's security and peace but also the strongest pillar for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. Another friend said, "Chairman Mao taught us that 'without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people.' This is completely correct. Chairman Mao's words summarize the vivid experience of the Chinese revolution. All revolutionary people of the world must study Chairman Mao's works well."

More than three hundred Sudanese friends attended the reception held by the Chinese Embassy in Khartoum on the evening of August 1. Among them were Sudanese Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Muhammad Ahmad Hawad, Speaker of the Constitutional Assembly Mubarak Shaddad, Minister of Education and Guidance Yahya Fazli, Minister of Commerce and Supply Ahmad Said Hamad, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Mirghani Hussein Zakkidin, Minister of Livestock and Rural Water Resources Nasir Din Said, and leaders of various political parties and mass organizations in Sudan.

The reception screened three Chinese films: "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought," "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts," and "Guerrillas on the Plain." Every time Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the guests erupted in thunderous applause. A Sudanese railway worker named Musa told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that he would forever love Chairman Mao. He said that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant and invincible thought, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become the strongest army in the world. This army is not only the staunch defender of the Chinese people but also the most reliable backbone for all revolutionary people and oppressed nations in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States.

More than four hundred Yemeni guests attended the reception held by the Chinese chargé d'affaires in Yemen, Zheng Kangping, on the evening of August 1. Among them were Yemeni Vice Commander-in-Chief and Vice Premier Abdul Qadir, Yemeni Deputy Chief of the General Staff Muhsin Akwa, and some Yemeni ministers.

At the reception, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and to the ever-developing friendship between the peoples of China and Yemen.
