The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is getting better and better. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the heroic Red Guards, with deep hatred for the class enemies and the greatest of the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, are waging a great struggle and criticism, and have launched a new revolutionary upsurge to completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters. In this new revolutionary upsurge, the people of the whole country, with fighting spirit, are celebrating the first anniversary of the convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The greatest historical achievement of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is to further establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, to establish Comrade Lin Biao, who has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, as the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough executor of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as the deputy helmsman of the whole Party, and to further consolidate the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to defeat the bourgeois headquarters led by the greatest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party. The documents of the plenary session, personally presided over by Chairman Mao, further systematically solved the theoretical, line, policy, method, and policy of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and pointed out to the people of the whole country the road to victory for consolidating proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and advancing socialism towards communism. This meeting is a meeting of great historical significance concerning the fate of our Party and state and the fate of the international communist movement.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was convened at a critical moment of intense struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters; it was convened at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was facing the danger of being strangled by the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." Chairman Mao said in the big-character poster:

"The first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country and the editorial of the People's Daily are written so well! Please read this big-character poster and this editorial again. But in more than fifty days, some leading comrades from the central to the local levels have done the opposite, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the great proletarian cultural revolution, confusing right and wrong, confusing black and white, encircling the revolutionary faction, suppressing different opinions, practicing white terror, feeling proud, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and crushing the spirit of the proletariat, how poisonous it is! In connection with the rightist trend in 1962 and the erroneous trend of 'left' in appearance but right in essence in 1964, is it not a lesson that awakens people deeply?"

This big-character poster is the most brilliant revolutionary document, the guiding ideology of this meeting, and the general line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" lifted the lid on the long-standing struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters within the Party, making the whole Party and the people of the whole country further understand the main object and main task of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The bourgeois headquarters is composed of the greatest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The head of this headquarters is China's Khrushchev. The main object of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is them; the main task of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to completely overthrow them.

The big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" deeply exposed the reactionary essence of the bourgeois headquarters, which is to stand on the reactionary bourgeois position and practice bourgeois dictatorship. Chairman Mao exposed in the big-character poster that some leading comrades from the central to the local levels did the opposite. The "opposite" here refers to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The "some leading comrades from the central to the local levels" here refer to the bourgeois headquarters composed of a handful of people with China's Khrushchev as the head. The big-character poster thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist ugly face of the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and called on the whole Party to "awaken deeply." This is a great battle call to completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters issued to the whole Party and the people of the whole country.

Throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there is always a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. The struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters is the most concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. To prevent our Party and state from changing color, the most important thing is to completely destroy this hidden bourgeois headquarters.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, especially after the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, although the capitalists always dream of restoration, no capitalist can be the leader. Those who can be the leaders and represent the bourgeoisie's attempt to realize capitalist restoration can only be the greatest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They are the agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party and state leadership organs. The appearance of the struggle between the two headquarters within the Party is an inevitable phenomenon and a necessary reflection of the existence of classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in society.

The bourgeoisie still has considerable power in society, but "a bird without a head cannot fly, and a snake without a head cannot move," and its head is the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of proletarian dictatorship. This bourgeois headquarters is the most important and dangerous enemy of the proletariat.

The historical experience of proletarian dictatorship tells us that if the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of proletarian dictatorship is not destroyed, the whole Party and state will inevitably change color one day. The fundamental reason for the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other socialist countries is that the greatest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in these countries usurped the leadership of the Party and state. This is the most serious lesson in the international communist movement.

Chairman Mao pointed out that under proletarian dictatorship, the main object of revolution is the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of proletarian dictatorship; we are revolutionizing this part within the organs of proletarian dictatorship. From the perspective of the whole Party and the whole country, they do not occupy the dominant position, but they must be overthrown to consolidate and strengthen proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. This theory is a summary of the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship internationally and in China.

In the long struggle against the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, Chairman Mao saw through their wolfish ambitions and saw that they are the greatest hidden danger and harm to our Party. In recent years, Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned the whole Party that our country faces the danger of capitalist restoration, and this danger mainly comes from the bourgeois headquarters led by the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

In January 1965, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of "Some Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside," the Twenty-Three Articles, which for the first time clearly pointed out: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party." The "those power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party" mentioned here refers to the greatest one, China's Khrushchev.

During the Central Work Conference in September 1965, Chairman Mao proposed at the enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee: "What if revisionism emerges in the Central Committee? It is very likely to emerge, and this is the most dangerous." The "revisionism in the Central Committee" mentioned by Chairman Mao refers to the bourgeois headquarters led by the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

In the "Notice" personally presided over by Chairman Mao on May 16, 1966, it was further pointed out: "Characters like Khrushchev are now sleeping by our side." The "characters like Khrushchev" mentioned here refer to the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

By August 1966, that is, the time of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the counter-revolutionary revisionist face of the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party had been fully exposed, and the bourgeois headquarters led by them had performed sufficiently. The time to bombard the bourgeois headquarters had ripened. Chairman Mao, with great foresight, with great courage, took decisive and resolute measures, wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," and decided to mobilize the masses to destroy the bourgeois headquarters.

To destroy the bourgeois headquarters, according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is not to adopt the method of dismissing officials from top to bottom, nor to adopt purely organizational measures, but to mobilize the masses and let the broad masses struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the Sixteen Articles, is the great revolutionary program personally presided over by Chairman Mao. The main target of the struggle in the Sixteen Articles is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The basic spirit running through the Sixteen Articles is to trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, carrying out a true and thorough socialist revolution from bottom to top.

The masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the real heroes. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, only by mobilizing hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, using the great democracy under proletarian dictatorship, adopting methods such as big-character posters, big debates, big discussions, and big struggles, can we expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, attack their reactionary fortresses in some regions, departments, and units, and seize back the power they have usurped.

"The Bombard the Headquarters" and the Sixteen Articles have inspired and armed millions of revolutionary masses, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned more fiercely. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses were stirred up, and the stifling atmosphere under the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line was swept away. Throughout the country, a situation of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters with all guns blazing emerged.

Revolution is the locomotive of history. In the past year, in a country of 700 million people, there have been earth-shaking changes.

After a year of great struggle, the proletariat has won a great victory. The counter-revolutionary face of the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party has been exposed to the broad revolutionary masses. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have been exposed, and their reactionary fortresses have been taken down. Proletarian dictatorship has been further consolidated. The counter-revolutionary line of the greatest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party has completely collapsed. The proletarian revolutionary faction, which has been suppressed and persecuted, has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, from scattered to concentrated, and has been tempered into a vast revolutionary army in the great waves of class struggle in the past year. In the great waves of class struggle in the past year, a large number of new personnel loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been tempered, and the young generation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is growing rapidly.

This is the great achievement of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the great achievement of the Sixteen Articles, the great power of "Bombard the Headquarters," and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

However, the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines has not ended. The central task facing the proletarian revolutionary faction is to completely criticize the greatest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters. This is a great historical task. To complete this great historical task, we must strengthen proletarian dictatorship, strengthen and improve the tools of proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely support and defend the proletarian revolutionary faction.

We must understand that only by completely overthrowing the greatest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and completely destroying the bourgeois headquarters, can we ensure that our Party and state do not change color, and can we carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end; only in the process of struggling to complete this task can we realize and consolidate the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction, realize and consolidate the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit, and complete the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and truly be able to hold power for the proletariat. If we forget this central task, we will forget Chairman Mao's teaching of "you must pay attention to state affairs," forget the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, forget the socialist road, and we will lose our way and go astray.

The dialectics of revolution are irresistible. The bourgeois headquarters will definitely be completely destroyed. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve a complete and thorough victory.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, young revolutionaries! On the occasion of the first anniversary of the convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for new achievements in completely destroying the bourgeois headquarters!

    彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
    ——纪念党的八届十一中全会召开一周年
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十三期社论
    无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。广大的工农兵群众，英勇的红卫兵小将，怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，开展大斗争、大批判，掀起了一个彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的新的革命高潮。在这个革命的新高潮中，全国人民怀着战斗的豪情，来庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年。
    党的八届十一中全会最伟大的历史功绩，就是进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，确立了一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、最忠诚、最坚决、最彻底执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的林彪同志，为全党的副统帅，进一步巩固了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，击败了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部。毛主席亲自主持制定的全会的文件，进一步系统地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，向全国人民指明了巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟，使社会主义向共产主义前进的胜利道路。这次会议，是关系我们党和国家命运、关系国际共产主义运动命运的一次具有伟大历史意义的会议。
    党的八届十一中全会，是在无产阶级同资产阶级、无产阶级司令部同资产阶级司令部激烈斗争的紧要关头召开的；是在无产阶级文化大革命面临被党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派扼杀的危险时刻召开的。在这个严重时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席，写了《炮打司令部》的大字报。毛主席在大字报中说：
    “全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读一遍这张大字报和这个评论。可是在五十多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”
    这张大字报，是最光辉的革命文献，是这次会议的指导思想，是无产阶级文化大革命的总方针。
    《炮打司令部》这张大字报，揭开了党内长期存在的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线、无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部斗争的盖子，使全党全国人民进一步明白了这一场无产阶级文化大革命的主要对象和主要任务。
    资产阶级司令部就是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派组成的，这个司令部的总头目，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。这场无产阶级文化大革命的主要对象，就是他们；这场无产阶级文化大革命的主要任务，就是彻底打倒他们。
    《炮打司令部》这张大字报，深刻地揭露了资产阶级司令部的反动实质，就是站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政。毛主席在大字报中揭露的从中央到地方的某些领导人却反其道而行之，这里所说的“道”，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这里所说的从中央到地方的某些领导人，就是指以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮人组成的资产阶级司令部。大字报彻底揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义丑恶嘴脸，并要全党“深醒”。这是向全党和全国人民发出的彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗号令。
    在社会主义整个历史时期内，始终存在着无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争。无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的最集中的表现。要防止我们党和国家变颜色，最重要的，就是彻底摧毁这个暗藏的资产阶级司令部。
    在无产阶级专政条件之下，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，特别是经过一九五七年反右派之后，资本家虽然时刻梦想复辟，但是，无论那一个资本家，已经不可能挂帅。能够挂帅，代表资产阶级妄图实现资本主义复辟的，只能是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们是资产阶级在党和国家领导机关内部的代理人。党内出现两个司令部之间的斗争，这是必然的现象，是社会存在着阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的必然的反映。
    社会上的资产阶级还有相当大的势力，但是“鸟无头不飞，蛇无头不行”，它的头就是暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部。这个资产阶级司令部，是无产阶级的最主要、最危险的敌人。
    无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，如果不摧毁暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部，整个党和国家势必有一天要改变颜色。苏联、南斯拉夫和其他一些社会主义国家，发生资本主义复辟的最根本原因，就是这些国家党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，篡夺了党和国家的领导权。这是国际共产主义运动中的最严重的教训。
    毛主席提出，在无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，是暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部；我们就是对无产阶级专政机构内部的这一部分进行革命。从我们党和我们国家的整体来说，他们是不占统治地位的，但是必须打倒他们，才能巩固和强化无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。这一理论，是概括了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，概括了中国无产阶级专政的历史经验，而得出来的。
    在同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派长期的斗争中，毛主席看穿了他的狼子野心，看穿了他是我们党的大隐患、大祸害。最近几年，毛主席不断向全党发出警告，我们国家存在资本主义复辟的危险性，这种危险，最主要的是来自以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部。
    一九六五年一月，毛主席亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》，即二十三条，第一次明确地指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。这里所说的党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派，最大的一个就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    一九六五年九月中央工作会议期间，毛主席在中央常委扩大会议上提出：“中央出了修正主义，你们怎么办？很可能出，这是最危险的。”毛主席说的中央出修正主义，就是指以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部。
    一九六六年五月十六日，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》中进一步指出：“赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁”。这里说的赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。
    到一九六六年八月，即党的八届十一中全会时，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义面目，已经暴露无遗，以他为首的资产阶级司令部表演得够充分了。炮打资产阶级司令部的时机已经成熟了。毛主席高瞻远瞩，以极大的魄力，采取坚决果断的措施，写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，下定决心，发动群众摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    摧毁资产阶级司令部，按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不是采取自上而下的罢官的做法，不是采取单纯的组织措施，而是放手发动群众，让广大群众起来同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。
    全会通过的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即十六条，是毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的革命纲领。十六条的斗争矛头，就是指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。十六条贯穿的基本精神，就是信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，进行一场真正的彻底的自下而上的社会主义革命。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众，是真正的英雄。在无产阶级文化大革命中，只有放手发动亿万革命群众，运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报等方法，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行，才能彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，攻克他们盘踞在一些地区、一些部门、一些单位的反动堡垒，把他们窃据的权力夺回来。
    《炮打司令部》和十六条，鼓舞了和武装了千千万万的革命群众，调动了广大群众的积极性。无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火更猛烈地燃烧起来了。亿万革命群众沸腾起来了，资产阶级反动路线压制下的“万马齐喑”的沉闷空气一扫而光，在全国范围内，出现了万炮猛轰资产阶级司令部的局面。
    革命是历史的火车头。一年来，在七亿人口的中国，发生了天翻地覆的变化。
    经过一年的大搏斗，无产阶级打了大胜仗，取得了大胜利。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命面目，已经暴露在广大革命群众面前。一小撮反革命修正主义分子被揭露出来了，他们盘踞的反动堡垒被攻下来了。无产阶级专政更加巩固了。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命阵线已经全线崩溃。受压抑、遭迫害的无产阶级革命派，在与资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，由小到大，由弱变强，由分散到集中，锻炼成为一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军。在一年的阶级斗争的大风浪中，锻炼出大批忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新的人材，无产阶级革命事业接班人的青年一代在迅速地成长着。
    这是八届十一中全会的伟大成果，十六条的伟大成果，这是《炮打司令部》的伟大威力，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    但是，两个司令部、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。摆在无产阶级革命派面前的中心任务，就是要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级的司令部。这是一个伟大的历史任务。为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，必须加强无产阶级专政，加强和改善无产阶级专政的工具，坚决支持、保卫无产阶级革命派。
    我们必须明白，只有从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，才能保证我们党和国家不变颜色，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；也只有在完成这个任务的斗争过程中，才能实现和巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，实现和巩固革命的三结合，才能很好地进行本单位的斗批改，才能完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，并且真正能够为无产阶级掌好权。如果忘了这个中心的任务，那就是忘记了毛主席“你们要关心国家大事”的教导，忘记了无产阶级文化大革命，忘记了社会主义道路，那就会迷失方向，走到邪路上去。
    革命的辩证法是不可抗拒的。资产阶级司令部一定要被彻底摧毁。无产阶级文化大革命，一定要取得全面的彻底的胜利。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，革命小将们！在纪念党的八届十一中全会和《炮打司令部》的大字报一周年的时候，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，创建新的功勋而奋斗！
