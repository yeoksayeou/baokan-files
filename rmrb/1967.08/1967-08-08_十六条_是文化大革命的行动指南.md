	“The Sixteen Points” is the Action Guideline for the Cultural Revolution
	Beijing Power Supply Bureau Proletarian Revolutionary Masses Great Alliance Headquarters Jiaodian Division

	Last year on August 8th, at the Eighth Central Committee’s Eleventh Plenary Session chaired by Chairman Mao, the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” was formulated. The proletarian revolutionaries listened to the broadcast over and over again, and were so excited that they couldn’t sleep until late into the night.

	The proletarian revolutionaries, armed with the “Sixteen Points,” have achieved brilliant victories in the movement over the past year. In the current high tide of criticism, recalling the arduous yet glorious path we have traversed under Chairman Mao’s leadership over the past year, we cannot help but shout: “Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!” We are determined to launch a new high tide in the criticism movement.

	Just the day after the “Sixteen Points” were issued, the work team implementing the bourgeois reactionary line in our bureau was preparing to flee. They hastily staged a farce of re-electing the revolutionary committee. The proletarian revolutionaries, armed with the “Sixteen Points,” engaged in a resolute struggle with them, demanding that the “Sixteen Points” be used as the standard to summarize the previous phase of the movement. The work team implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in our bureau, exerting tremendous pressure on the proletarian revolutionaries. They surrounded us with big-character posters, criticized and struggled against us in small group meetings, and the labels of “thief” and “rightist” flew everywhere, suppressing the fiery cultural revolution. Their methods against the proletarian revolutionaries were so vicious! But for the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road in our bureau, they showed every consideration and protection. To help them evade the struggle of the masses, they sent this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to Qinglongqiao and other places far from our bureau for “training” and “re-education.” With the “Sixteen Points,” the proletarian revolutionaries saw clearly that the focus of the work team was not to criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, but to protect them; they were not to discover, develop, and strengthen the revolutionary leftists, but to suppress the revolutionary leftists. They were implementing a thorough bourgeois reactionary line of suppressing the revolutionary masses and protecting the power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road.

	After the work team withdrew, the proletarian revolutionaries used the “Sixteen Points” as a powerful weapon to educate, unite, and mobilize the masses, finally forming a vast revolutionary army. On the road to victory, the proletarian revolutionaries always used the “Sixteen Points” as the standard to measure their actions.

	At present, when the revolutionary masses across the country are launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, we proletarian revolutionaries will resolutely follow the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, take up the pen as a sword, and thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

	The struggle over the past year has made us deeply feel that the “Sixteen Points” is the programmatic guiding document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study the “Sixteen Points” at all times, propagate the “Sixteen Points,” master the “Sixteen Points,” and use the “Sixteen Points” to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    “十六条”是文化大革命的行动指南
    北京供电局无产阶级革命派大联合总部　郊电分部
    去年八月八日，在毛主席亲自主持的八届十一中全会上，制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》。无产阶级革命派一遍一遍地听着广播，直到深夜，都激动得睡不着觉。
    无产阶级革命派以“十六条”为武器，在这一年来的运动中，取得了辉煌的胜利。在当前大批判的高潮中，回忆一年来在毛主席领导下，我们所走过的艰难而光荣的路程，无不高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”决心把大批判运动掀起一个新的高潮。
    就在“十六条”公布后的第二天，在我局执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组准备溜走，他们匆匆忙忙地导演了一幕改选文革的丑剧。无产阶级革命派以“十六条”为武器，和他们展开了坚决的斗争，要求以“十六条”为标准，衡量总结前一段运动。工作组在我局执行了资产阶级反动路线，对无产阶级革命派施加了强大的压力，用大字报围攻，小组会批、斗，“扒手”、“右派”的帽子满天飞，把轰轰烈烈的文化革命运动压了下去。他们对无产阶级革命派的手段何其毒也！而对局里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却是百般体贴，保护备至。为了使他们逃避群众的斗争，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子送到远离我局的青龙桥等地“训练”、“修养”。有了“十六条”，无产阶级革命派心明眼亮，认清了工作组的重点不是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而是保护他们；他们不是发现、发展和壮大革命左派，坚决依靠革命的左派，而是打击压制革命左派。他们所执行的是地地道道的打击革命群众，保护党内走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线。
    在工作组撤走以后，无产阶级革命派以“十六条”为教育群众、团结群众、发动群众的有力武器，终于形成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军。在胜利前进的道路上，无产阶级革命派始终以“十六条”作为衡量自己行动的标准。
    当前，正当全国亿万革命群众掀起了革命的大批判新高潮的时候，我们无产阶级革命派，坚决按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，拿起笔，作刀枪，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    一年来的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到“十六条”是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性指导文件。我们一定要时时学习“十六条”，宣传“十六条”，掌握“十六条”，运用“十六条”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
