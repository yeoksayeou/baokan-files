A Red Flag in Sichuan for Supporting the Left; A Good Example for the People's Armed Forces Department

The Self-reliant Armed Forces Department of Ziguang Firmly Stands on Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

They are the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionary faction. In the fierce and complex class struggle, they withstand any countercurrent, firmly unite with the proletarian revolutionary faction, fight alongside them, and help the proletarian revolutionary faction to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, solving various ideological and practical problems.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 20 — During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang City, Sichuan Province, firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart, they united and fought alongside the proletarian revolutionary faction, withstood the impact of countercurrents, and passed the test of turbulent waves, making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have become a red flag for supporting the left in Sichuan and a good example for the people's armed forces department.

In September of last year, the Red Guards movement swept through the ancient salt city of Ziguang like a spring thunderstorm. The streets quickly appeared with big-character posters pointing at the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. The handful of power-holders within the municipal Party committee were taken aback and quickly deceived a part of the masses who were unaware of the truth, surrounding and attacking the revolutionary youngsters day and night, labeling them as "monsters and demons." At that time, although the People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang did not directly intervene in the local cultural revolution, fierce debates had already erupted within the department. The armed forces department had a thousand and one connections with the old municipal committee, and all work was carried out under the leadership of the municipal committee. There were many relationships and acquaintances, many family members working in local agencies, and children studying locally. If they had followed the "old habits" and "old procedures," and considered the immediate interests of "work relationships," "emotions," "face," "small families," and "small units," it would have been easy to side with the old municipal committee and suppress the revolutionary faction. The People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang faced a severe test.

In the fierce and complex struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the leaders of the armed forces department resolutely stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They organized everyone to bring the various problems in society and the various active thoughts to a concentrated study of Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and related documents and editorials for eight days. This helped everyone understand that the revolutionary youngsters rising up to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road was "excellent." With the correct understanding and correct stance, emotions also changed. Those who originally thought the Red Guards movement was a bit "excessive" felt, through study, that the Red Guards spoke reasonably, acted justly, and were very pleasing to the eye, particularly lovable. Some even repeatedly persuaded and mobilized their children to join the Red Guards, persuading and mobilizing their family members to firmly support the Red Guards. The first batch of student revolutionary organizations in the city had a daughter of the deputy director of the armed forces department, Li Zongbo; the first big-character poster in the city exposing the old municipal committee's incitement of the masses to fight the students was written by a family member of an armed forces department cadre.

The armed forces department firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely supported the actions of the proletarian revolutionary faction, frightening the handful of power-holders within the old municipal committee who were taking the capitalist road. They first used threats and intimidation to try to make the armed forces department change its stance; when threats failed, they tried to win them over with inducements. However, the response from the armed forces department was: to encourage children and family members to rebel more boldly and thoroughly. Thus, the handful of power-holders within the old municipal committee hated the armed forces department even more. They posted big-character posters on the door of the armed forces department, threatening to arrest "counter-revolutionaries" and "monsters and demons." At this time, the armed forces department comrades were even more resolute, saying: The armed forces department is Chairman Mao's armed forces department, the people's armed forces department, the revolutionary armed forces department. It can only listen to Chairman Mao's words, the people's words, and the revolutionary rebels' words, and it absolutely cannot listen to the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. We are determined to rebel against these bad elements.

In January of this year, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." The news arrived, and the armed forces department was in an uproar. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" echoed through the night. They hurriedly wrote a big-character poster openly supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction, excitedly saying: Chairman Mao ordered us to support the left, this is the greatest trust in our People's Liberation Army. We must definitely complete this new glorious combat mission, rely on Mao Zedong Thought to support the left well, use Mao Zedong Thought to support the left well, and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to support the left well.

The next day, the armed forces department, through democratic election by all and review by the Party committee, established a support-the-left team led by Comrade Li Zongbo, with a firm stance, clear banner, and thoroughly siding with the proletarian revolutionary faction. The proletarian revolutionary faction called this team: "The leftists have taken over the support-the-left home, the leftists have taken over the support-the-left power." Because of this, the revolutionary faction trusted the armed forces department, and the armed forces department also trusted the revolutionary faction. The revolutionary faction treated the armed forces department as their own home, coming and going freely, and seeking help from the armed forces department when they had problems; the armed forces department also treated the revolutionary faction as family, unrestrained, and discussing matters with them. The armed forces department and the revolutionary faction had completely consistent emotions and stances, spoke in unison, and walked in step. Whatever the revolutionary faction wanted to do, the armed forces department actively did it; whatever the armed forces department said, the revolutionary faction was willing to listen. Sometimes, when the armed forces department was holding a Party committee meeting, revolutionary youngsters came, and they would first solve the problems of the revolutionary faction; sometimes, in the middle of the night, when revolutionary youngsters came, they would go to whoever was called; sometimes, when revolutionary faction warriors did not come to the armed forces department for a day or half a day, they still worried about them, taking time to actively go to schools, factories, rural areas, agencies, and even to their homes to talk with them, helping them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, solving their various ideological and practical problems, and seeking their opinions and demands for the armed forces department's support-the-left work. Through the joint efforts of the armed forces department and the revolutionary faction, by the end of February, the revolutionary faction had absolute superiority in both political and organizational terms, and the situation was excellent. The ship of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was sailing forward bravely along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao!

However, at this moment, a countercurrent stirred up by a handful of power-holders within the Sichuan Province who were taking the capitalist road swept into Ziguang City. Many revolutionary mass organizations were labeled as "counter-revolutionary" or "rightist" organizations, and many revolutionary masses were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" or "rightists." The People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang was also called a "den of monsters and demons," "supporting the rightists and sheltering bad people." A severe class struggle test faced the armed forces department. All support-the-left personnel swore in unison: "To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we dare to sacrifice everything." They took "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" as their oath, continuing to fight despite various dangers. In the most difficult times, they went out to the streets and wrote large banners saying, "The soldiers of our department will forever swear to die with the revolutionary rebels, fight with them, and win with them." The proletarian revolutionary faction, in the most difficult days, heard the resolute support of the People's Liberation Army once again, moved to tears, raised both hands, and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Liberation Army!" With trembling hands, they wrote steel-like oaths on the large banners: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot be abandoned! Heroes have the courage of heroes, revolution has the will of revolution, revolutionary rebel warriors will die to defend Chairman Mao!" They called the People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang: "A brave ship sailing forward in the turbulent waves, a red flag flying high in the support-the-left team."

The east wind swept away the remaining clouds. Under the wise decision of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the People's Armed Forces Department of Ziguang and the proletarian revolutionary faction, after a fierce and arduous battle, finally broke through again, marching forward with heads held high, continuing to sail against the wind and waves, and hoisting the sails forward!

Now, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ziguang City is getting better and better. Broad revolutionary teachers and students have united in the great criticism of the revolution, and poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside have also achieved great unity in the revolution. Under the strong help and resolute support of the armed forces department, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Ziguang City has raised the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," and launched a new high tide of exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the biggest power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road across the city. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, and revolutionary students, with the attitude of revolutionary masters, firmly guard their production posts, with great fearlessness and heroism, care for the country, look at the world, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," making industrial and agricultural production present an unprecedented good situation. The total industrial output value in the first half of the year increased by 28.9% compared to the same period last year, small spring grain increased by more than 50%, oil crops increased by more than onefold, procurement tasks were completed more than onefold, and autumn production is also expected to be a bumper harvest.

    四川地区支左的一面红旗　人民武装部的一个好榜样
    自贡武装部坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边
    他们是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，在激烈复杂的阶级斗争中，顶住任何逆流的冲击，坚决和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，解决各种思想问题和实际问题
    新华社成都二十日电　四川省自贡市人民武装部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，同无产阶级革命派肩并肩，心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，顶住了逆流的冲击，经受了骇浪的考验，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的贡献，成为四川地区支左的一面红旗，人民武装部的一个好榜样。
    去年九月，红卫兵运动象滚滚春雷在古老的盐都自贡市兴起了，街头上迅速出现矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大字报。市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派慌了手脚，赶忙蒙骗一部分不明真相的群众，通宵达旦地围攻革命小将，把他们打成“牛鬼蛇神”。当时，自贡市人民武装部虽然没有直接介入当地的文化大革命，但是内部却展开了激烈的争论。武装部和旧市委有着千丝万缕的联系，各项工作都是在市委领导下进行的，关系多、熟人多，许多家属在地方机关工作，子女在地方就学。如果按“老习惯”、“老规程”办事，如果从“工作关系”、“感情”、“面子”、“小家庭”、“小单位”等等眼前利害关系考虑，屁股很容易坐在旧市委一方，压制革命派。自贡市人民武装部面临着严峻的考验。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈复杂斗争中，武装部的领导同志坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，组织大家带着社会上的各种问题，带着各种活思想，集中八天时间，认真学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》和有关文件、社论，使大家认识到，革命小将起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，“好得很”。认识正确了，立场对头了，感情也就不同了。原来觉得红卫兵运动有些“过火”的人，通过学习，感到红卫兵说话受听，作事在理，非常顺眼，特别可爱。有的甚至于多次说服、动员自己的子女参加红卫兵，说服、动员自己的家属坚决支持红卫兵。全市第一批学生革命组织的勤务员中，就有武装部副部长李宗伯的女儿；全市第一张揭露旧市委挑动群众斗学生的大字报，就是武装部一个干部的家属写的。
    武装部坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的行动，吓坏了旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们首先采取威胁恐吓的手段，要武装部改变立场；威胁不成，又来拉拢引诱。但是，武装部同志的回答是：更加鼓励子女、家属大胆地造反，彻底地造反。这样，旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对武装部就更恨了。他们把大字报贴到武装部的大门上，扬言要抓“反革命”、揪“牛鬼蛇神”的后台。这时，武装部同志更加坚定，他们说：武装部是毛主席的武装部，人民的武装部，革命的武装部，只能听毛主席的话，听人民的话，听革命造反派的话，决不能听党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的话，我们就是要造这一小撮坏人的反。
    今年一月，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出伟大号召：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”消息一到，武装部沸腾了起来。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻夜空。他们连夜赶写公开支持无产阶级革命派的大字报，激动地说：毛主席叫我们支左，这是对我们人民解放军的最大信任。我们一定要完成这一新的光荣战斗任务，靠毛泽东思想支好左，用毛泽东思想支好左，站在毛主席革命路线上支好左。
    第二天，武装部就经过大家民主推选，党委审查，成立了以李宗伯同志为首的、立场坚定、旗帜鲜明、彻底倒向无产阶级革命派一边的支左班子。无产阶级革命派称这个班子是：“左派当了支左的家，左派掌了支左的权。”正因为这样，革命派信得过武装部，武装部也信得过革命派。革命派把武装部当成自己的家，随来随往，有问题就找武装部；武装部也把革命派看作家里的人，无拘无束，有事就同他们商量。武装部和革命派之间，感情完全一致，立场完全相同，说话说得拢，走路走得齐。革命派要办的事，武装部积极办，武装部所说的话，革命派乐意听。有时，武装部正在开党委会，革命小将来了，就先解决革命派的问题；有时，半夜三更，革命小将一到，找谁谁就去；有时，革命派战士一天半天不来武装部，他们还惦念不止，挤时间主动到学校、工厂、农村、机关，甚至到他们家里去找他们谈心，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，解决他们的各种思想问题和实际问题，征求他们对部队支左工作的意见和要求。经过武装部和革命派的共同努力，自贡市到二月底，革命派无论在政治上或组织上，都占了绝对优势，形势一片大好。无产阶级文化大革命的航船，正沿着毛主席指引的革命航道勇往直前！
    可是，就在这个时候，四川省一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掀起的一股逆流卷进了自贡市，不少革命群众组织被打成了“反革命”或“右派”组织，许多革命群众被打成了“反革命”或“右派”。自贡市武装部也被说成是“牛鬼蛇神的黑窝子”，“支持了右派，包庇了坏人”。一场严峻的阶级斗争考验着武装部。全体支左人员一致发誓：“为保卫毛主席的革命路线，敢于牺牲个人的一切。”他们以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”为誓词，冒着各种危险继续坚持斗争。在最困难时刻，他们上街刷出“我部指战员永远誓死和革命造反派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起”的大标语。无产阶级革命派在最艰苦的日子里，再一次听到解放军坚决支持他们的声音，感动得热泪盈眶，高举两手连呼：“毛主席万岁！”“解放军万岁！”用颤动的手在大标语上写下钢铁般的誓言：“头可断，血可流，毛主席的革命路线不能丢！英雄就有英雄胆，革命就有革命志，革命造反派战士誓死保卫毛主席！”他们称自贡市人民武装部是：“惊涛骇浪中一艘勇往直前的航船，支左队伍中一面凌空招展的红旗。”
    东风浩荡扫残云。在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策下，自贡市人民武装部和无产阶级革命派，经过一场艰苦激烈的战斗，终于重新杀了出来，昂首阔步，继续沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，乘风破浪，扬帆前进！
    现在，自贡市无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好，广大革命师生在革命的大批判中联合起来了，贫下中农在农村也实现了革命大联合。自贡市的无产阶级革命派在武装部的大力帮助和坚决支持下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，掀起了全市性对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮。革命的工人、革命的农民、革命的学生都以革命主人翁的态度，坚守生产岗位，以大无畏的英雄气概，心怀祖国，放眼世界，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，使工农业生产出现了十七年来从未有过的大好景象。上半年工业总产值比去年同期增长百分之二十八点九，小春粮食增产百分之五十以上，油料作物增产一倍以上，征购任务超额完成一倍多，秋季生产也是丰收在望。
