The Chinese people are not to be messed with. The Mongols' revisionism will lead to their downfall. Forty thousand revolutionary masses from the capital march to the Mongolian embassy to protest and parade.

The people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot angrily denounce the serious anti-China crimes of the Mongolian revisionists.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 12, revolutionary masses and Red Guards from the capital, filled with indignation, continued to protest and parade in front of the Mongolian embassy in China today. Over the past few days, the number of participants has reached four hundred thousand. The protesters emphasized that the Mongolian revisionist leadership, following the lead of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, is madly anti-China and will meet a bad end. The crimes committed by the Mongolian revisionist leadership will definitely be thoroughly settled by the Chinese people!

Tens of thousands of protesters expressed their firm support for the August 10 note of protest from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They said, our government's decision to expel the criminal who insulted the portrait of the great leader and teacher of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Mao Zedong, is a great and righteous deed. It greatly boosts the morale of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, and it greatly dampens the spirits of the Mongolian revisionist leadership. We fully support this! We wholeheartedly support this!

Now, the criminal, Dash-Oorj, has been escorted out of Beijing by our Red Guards and left the country via Erlian on the afternoon of the 11th. The Red Guards who escorted the criminal out of the country said at the Beijing railway station, the staff of the Mongolian embassy in our country are so audacious as to insult the portrait of our great leader, Chairman Mao. This is a new crime committed by the Zedenbal regime acting as a lackey of the Soviet revisionists and madly opposing China. We will definitely settle accounts for the Mongolian revisionists' heinous crimes. The more fiercely the Mongolian revisionists oppose China, the more miserably they will fail and the quicker they will perish.

In recent days, revolutionary workers from the capital, poor and lower-middle-class peasants from the suburbs, revolutionary teachers and students from primary and secondary schools, Red Guards, organizational staff, and neighborhood residents have flocked to the Mongolian embassy in China in groups. They held high red flags, carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, and held copies of the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Mongolian revisionism!" "Down with the lackey of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, Zedenbal!" "Those who oppose China will meet a bad end!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!"

In front of the Mongolian embassy, Red Guards handed over stacks of protest letters to the Mongolian ambassador to China, Tsebregmid, angrily protesting the crime committed by the staff of the Mongolian embassy in China of insulting the portrait of our great leader, Chairman Mao. Under the stern condemnation of the Red Guards, Tsebregmid had no choice but to accept the protest letters.

Revolutionary masses who witnessed the criminal act of Dash-Oorj on the morning of August 9 distributed leaflets in front of the Mongolian embassy in China, exposing with ironclad facts Dash-Oorj's evil deed of insulting the portrait of our great leader, Chairman Mao. They said, the evidence is clear, and the Mongolian revisionist leadership cannot deny it!

The brave Red Guards, filled with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, posted a giant portrait of Chairman Mao outside the Mongolian embassy in China, with bold red characters underneath reading, "The teacher of the people of the world, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!" In the parade, a Red Guard carried a small blackboard, chanting slogans as he walked. The blackboard read, "The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, filled with hatred, the Chinese people are not to be messed with, Mongolian revisionism will lead to their downfall!" The Red Guards warned the Mongolian revisionist leadership: those who oppose China will meet a bad end.

Some revolutionary comrades from the Wuhan area who are currently in the capital joined the revolutionary masses of the capital in the protest parade today. In their protest letter, they pointed out: the Zedenbal leadership has also jumped out in this wave of anti-China sentiment, acting as a lackey of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, madly opposing the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—the thought of Mao Zedong, and opposing our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is like trying to stop a car with one's arm, and in the end, it will surely be crushed by the wheels of history!

All Chinese staff working at the Mongolian embassy in China also wrote a protest letter with indignation, lodging the strongest protest with the Mongolian embassy in China, and vowing to carry the struggle against revisionism to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hohhot dated August 13, revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Hohhot held a protest parade today, angrily denouncing the serious crime of the staff of the Mongolian embassy in China who shamelessly insulted the portrait of our great leader, Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups in our country, and the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. They firmly support the strongest protest note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Mongolian revisionists.

Revolutionary masses and Red Guards of the Mongol, Han, Hui, Manchu, and other ethnic groups in Hohhot, filled with boundless faith, loyalty, admiration, and love for our great leader Chairman Mao, surged onto the streets in a grand procession this morning. They held high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and raised red flags and placards, repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Mongolian revisionism!" "Down with the lackey of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, Zedenbal!" "Firmly support the strong protest note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Mongolian revisionists!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!" Many revolutionary masses also wrote large protest slogans against Mongolian revisionism on the walls on both sides of the street. Many Red Guards, after hearing the news that our government has decided to expel the criminal who insulted the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, Dash-Oorj, all expressed their enthusiastic support.

The revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups participating in the protest parade pointed out: this time, the staff of the Mongolian embassy in China dared to shamelessly insult the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao in our capital. This is another new crime committed by the Zedenbal leadership of Mongolia, who are diehard followers of Soviet revisionism in opposing China. We solemnly warn the Mongolian revisionist authorities: the crimes you have committed against the Chinese people will definitely be settled by the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in our country. American imperialism and Soviet revisionism opposing China will meet a bad end, and the Zedenbal revisionist leadership, following their master, the Soviet revisionists, madly opposing China, will also meet a bad end.

    据新华社十二日讯　首都革命群众和红卫兵小将怀着激愤的情绪，今天继续到蒙古驻中国大使馆门前举行示威游行。几天来参加示威的群众已有四十万人。示威的群众强调指出：蒙古修正主义领导集团追随美帝、苏修疯狂反华，决没有好下场，蒙修领导集团所犯下的罪行，中国人民是一定要彻底清算的！
    成千成万的示威游行群众表示坚决拥护我国外交部十日的抗议照会。他们说，我国政府决定把侮辱中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像的犯罪分子达希敖额尔特驱逐出境，这是大快人心的好事，大长了中国人民和世界革命人民的志气，大灭了蒙修领导集团的威风，我们一千个拥护！一万个拥护！
    现在，达希敖额尔特这个犯罪分子已在我红卫兵押送下，于十一日下午滚出北京，经二连出境。押送罪犯出境的红卫兵在北京车站上说，蒙古驻我国大使馆人员贼胆包天，竟敢侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席像，这是泽登巴尔统治集团充当苏修走卒疯狂反华的新罪行。蒙修的滔天罪行我们一定要清算。蒙修反华越凶，必然失败得更惨，灭亡得更快。
    连日来，首都革命职工、郊区贫下中农社员、大中学校的革命师生和红卫兵小将、机关干部以及街道居民，成群结队涌到蒙古驻华大使馆门前，他们高举红旗，抬着伟大领袖毛主席画像，手拿红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒蒙修！”“打倒美帝苏修的奴才泽登巴尔！”“一切反华的人决没有好下场！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”在蒙古使馆门前，红卫兵小将们向蒙古驻中国大使策伯格米德递交了一叠叠抗议书，愤怒抗议蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员所犯下的侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席像的罪行。在红卫兵小将义正词严的谴责下，策伯格米德不得不低头接受了小将们的抗议书。
    曾经在八月九日上午亲眼目睹达希敖额尔特犯罪事实的革命群众，在蒙古驻中国大使馆门前散发了传单，用铁一般的事实揭露了达希敖额尔特侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席像的罪恶行径。他们说，罪证确凿，蒙修领导集团想赖是赖不掉的！
    英勇的红卫兵小将们，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情，在蒙古驻中国大使馆门外，贴上毛主席巨幅画像，下面写着鲜红的大字：“全世界人民的导师，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”在游行的队伍中，一位红卫兵小将带着一块小黑板，边走边呼口号，黑板上写着：“无产阶级革命派，仇恨满胸怀，中国人民不好惹，蒙修反华必垮台！”红卫兵小将们警告蒙修领导集团：凡是反华的决没有好下场。
    正在首都的一些武汉地区的无产阶级革命派战友，今天同首都革命群众一道示威游行。他们在抗议书里指出：泽登巴尔领导集团在这次反华浪潮中也跳了出来，充当美帝和苏修的走狗，疯狂地反对当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，反对我国无产阶级文化大革命，这不过是螳臂挡车，到头来必然会被历史的车轮碾得粉碎！
    在蒙古驻中国大使馆工作的全体中国职工，也怀着愤慨的心情写了抗议书，向蒙古驻中国大使馆提出最强烈抗议，表示一定要把反修斗争进行到底。
    新华社呼和浩特十三日电　呼和浩特各族革命群众今天举行示威游行，愤怒声讨蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员肆无忌惮地侮辱我国各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳、世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像的严重罪行，坚决拥护我外交部向蒙修提出的最强烈抗议。
    呼和浩特市的蒙古、汉、回、满等各族革命群众和红卫兵小将，今天上午怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜、无限热爱的感情，浩浩荡荡地涌上街头。他们高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手持红色宝书《毛主席语录》，高举着红旗和标语牌，不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒蒙修！”“打倒美帝、苏修的奴才泽登巴尔！”“坚决拥护我外交部强烈抗议蒙修的照会！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”不少革命群众还在大街两旁的墙壁上写下了许多抗议蒙修反华的大字标语，许多红卫兵小将听说我国政府已决定把侮辱我们伟大的领袖毛主席的像的犯罪分子达希敖额尔特驱逐出境的消息后，都表示热烈拥护。
    游行示威的各族革命群众指出：这次蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员，竟敢在我国首都肆无忌惮地公然侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席的像，这是蒙古泽登巴尔领导集团死心塌地地追随苏修反华的又一新罪行。我们严正警告蒙修当局：你们对中国人民所犯下的一桩桩罪行，我国各族革命人民是一定要清算的。美帝、苏修反华决没有好下场，泽登巴尔修正主义领导集团追随其主子苏修疯狂反华，也决不会有好下场。
