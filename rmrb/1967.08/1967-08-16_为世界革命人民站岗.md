We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding Tiananmen Square day and night, look up at Tiananmen Gate and gaze out at the world. We see the surging revolutionary movements of the people of the five continents, and our hearts are filled with boundless excitement and joy!

In front of the radiant Tiananmen Gate, we will never forget the blazing fires of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, nor the red flags flying over Jinggangshan. We will never forget the abundant fruits of the 25,000-li Long March, nor the brilliant light of the Zunyi Conference. Over the past forty years, our great leader Chairman Mao has led us through countless rapids and storms, and we have finally achieved this great victory. It was here on Tiananmen Gate that on October 1, 1949, our great helmsman Chairman Mao personally raised the first Five-Star Red Flag, proclaiming the birth of the new People's Republic of China under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was also here on Tiananmen Gate that during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao received over ten million Red Guards and revolutionary masses eight times, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from Beijing to the nation, from one high tide to another new high tide. He announced the demise of China's Khrushchev and the failure of his plot to restore capitalism, making our proletarian dictatorship more solid than ever and our great socialist motherland stronger than ever!

Standing guard at Tiananmen Gate, every minute and every second, our hearts are connected with the hearts of the revolutionary people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the entire world. We have personally witnessed: countless Red Guards from all over the country come to Tiananmen Gate, and their first words are to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" Their first action is to salute and pledge allegiance to Chairman Mao; their first task is to loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations. We often see: many foreign friends come to Tiananmen Gate again and again, facing the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and singing "The East is Red" and "The Ship of the East" with great enthusiasm. Before leaving China, they still want to come to Tiananmen Gate to take a few photos to bring back to their relatives who have not been to China. These touching scenes, one by one, make us deeply feel that we, the soldiers guarding Tiananmen Gate, are not only guarding for the people of China, but also for the revolutionary people of the world.

Tiananmen Gate, which the revolutionary people of the world look up to, is inseparable from the "August 1" Nanchang Uprising that fired the first shot, and the struggles led by our great leader on Jinggangshan. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and defending the dictatorship of the proletariat is also inseparable from the gun. The revolutionary people of the world all want to follow the only correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. We guard Tiananmen Gate to defend our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and also to defend the path to the complete victory of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

The Party and the people have entrusted us with the task of guarding Tiananmen Gate, which is our greatest honor and happiness. We will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary people of the entire nation and the world.

Currently, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing in depth. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are united in their hatred of the enemy, rising up with great strength, and launching a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in various places. We must also take up our pens as weapons and actively participate in the great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev.

We are the guards of Chairman Mao. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat, and they will make their last struggles." "The Chinese people will not pity the snake-like evil people." We must give them a thorough beating, until they are completely overthrown, smashed, and exposed, so that they can never rise again!

    为世界革命人民站岗
    守卫天安门某部一连全体警卫战士
    我们日日夜夜守卫在天安门前的解放军战士，仰望天安门，放眼全世界，看到五大洲人民的革命运动汹涌澎湃，我们的心情无比激动，无比兴奋！
    在光辉灿烂的天安门前，我们忘不了当年秋收起义的烈火熊熊，井冈山上的红旗飘飘；更不会忘记二万五千里长征结出的丰硕果实，遵义会议放射出的万丈光芒。四十年来，伟大统帅毛主席带领我们，越过了多少急流险滩，踏平了多少惊涛骇浪，终于取得今天的伟大胜利。就是在天安门上，一九四九年十月一日，伟大舵手毛主席亲手升起了第一面五星红旗，宣告了无产阶级专政的新中国的诞生。也是在天安门上，毛主席在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，八次接见了一千多万红卫兵和革命群众，把无产阶级文化大革命从北京推向全国，从一个高潮推向一个新的高潮，宣布了中国的赫鲁晓夫的灭亡和他复辟资本主义阴谋的破产，使我们的无产阶级专政政权空前巩固，伟大的社会主义祖国空前强大！
    在天安门前站岗，每分钟每秒钟，都使我们的心，和全国革命人民的心，和全世界革命人民的心，紧紧地连结在一起。我们亲眼看到：无数来自全国各地的红卫兵小将，来到天安门前，第一句话就是高呼毛主席万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！第一个行动就是向毛主席敬礼宣誓；第一件事就是高声朗读毛主席语录。我们也经常看到：许多外国朋友，一次又一次地来到天安门前，面对着毛主席的巨幅画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，纵情高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。他们临离开中国时，还要到天安门前，拍上几张照片，带给没有来过中国的亲人。这些动人的情景，一件件，一桩桩，都使我们深刻地体会到：我们守卫在天安门前的战士，是在为中国人民站岗，也是在为世界革命人民站岗。
    全世界革命人民瞻望的天安门，是和“八一”南昌起义打响第一枪，我们伟大领袖领导的秋收起义和井冈山的斗争分不开的。“枪杆子里面出政权”，保卫无产阶级专政同样离不开枪杆子。全世界革命人民都要走毛主席指引的这条唯一正确的道路。我们守卫天安门，是在保卫最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，也是在保卫全世界人民夺取革命斗争彻底胜利的道路。
    党和人民把守卫天安门的任务交给我们，这是我们的最大光荣、最大幸福。我们决不辜负全国和全世界革命人民的期望。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正向纵深发展。亿万革命群众同仇敌忾，奋起千钧棒，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他在各地的代理人猛烈开火。我们也要拿起笔作刀枪，积极投入对中国的赫鲁晓夫的大批判、大斗争。
    我们是毛主席身边的警卫战士，我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“中国人民决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”。狠狠地痛打落水狗，直到把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！
