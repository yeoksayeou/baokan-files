Just Congo (Brazzaville) militia members recently spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters, praising Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

A militia member named Daniel said, "The boundless rays of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the world. Today, the revolutionary people of many countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America can take up arms to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, all of which are concrete practices and universal applications of Chairman Mao's thought of 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This vividly illustrates that Mao Zedong Thought is the most contemporary revolutionary thought."

He said, "The hearts of revolutionary people all over the world are with the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all oppressed people. With Mao Zedong Thought, the world revolution has hope. I firmly believe that Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' will bloom and bear fruit all over the world."

Militia member Lobaki said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and all reactionaries. The theory of 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' that Chairman Mao summed up from revolutionary practice is an unshakable truth. Only by taking up arms and waging armed struggle can imperialism and all reactionaries be thoroughly eliminated."

Another militia member, Gabriel, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that while the enemy is sharpening his knife, we should also sharpen ours. Chairman Mao's teaching tells us: the enemy uses guns to invade and oppress the people, and the people should use guns to fight back against them." He continued, "The people's lack of arms is the reason they have long been bullied and oppressed by imperialism. Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment of 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' speaks the hearts of revolutionary people. This great truth points out the bright path to the people's complete liberation."

Militia member Francois said, "Historical experience proves that imperialism and reactionaries will never grant independence and freedom to the oppressed people. To struggle for independence, one must rely on the people's own strength and take up arms to engage in a head-on struggle with the enemy."

He continued, "Chairman Mao says, 'All reactionaries are paper tigers.' To overthrow imperialism and all reactionaries, what should we rely on? To revolt with bare hands, the enemy will never be defeated, and the revolution will never be victorious. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, using the people's revolutionary arms to counter the imperialists' and their running dogs' counter-revolutionary arms, not only has a new China emerged, but a new world will also certainly emerge."

Militia member Anthony said, "The People's Liberation Army of China, personally created, led, and nurtured by Chairman Mao, is the strongest and most exemplary revolutionary army in the world. The political and military lines that Chairman Mao has formulated for the People's Liberation Army of China have universal significance. Learning from Mao Zedong Thought and learning from the People's Liberation Army of China is the direction that all revolutionary armies should strive for."

    刚果（布）朋友盛赞毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想
    用革命的枪杆子打出一个新世界
    据新华社布拉柴维尔电　刚果（布）民卫团员最近向新华社记者发表谈话，盛赞毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想。
    一位名叫丹尼尔的民卫团员说：“光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照全世界。今天，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家和地区的革命人民能够拿起武器，进行抗击帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，都是毛主席‘枪杆子里面出政权’的光辉思想的具体实践和普遍应用。这就最生动地说明了毛泽东思想是当代最具有时代特征的革命思想。”
    他说：“全世界革命人民的心都向着伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席是一切被压迫人民心中的红太阳。有了毛泽东思想，世界革命就有了希望。我坚信，毛主席的‘枪杆子里面出政权’的光辉思想必将在全世界开花结果。”
    民卫团员洛巴基说：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想是打败帝国主义和一切反动派的最强大的思想武器。毛主席从革命斗争实践中总结出来的‘枪杆子里面出政权’的理论，是颠扑不破的真理。只有拿起枪杆子搞武装斗争，才能彻底消灭帝国主义和一切反动派。”
    另一位民卫团员加布里尔说：“毛主席教导说，敌人在磨刀，我们也应该磨刀。毛主席的这一教导告诉我们：敌人用枪杆子侵略和镇压人民，人民也应该用枪杆子来还击他们。”他接着说：“人民没有武装，是长期受帝国主义欺侮和压迫的原因。毛主席‘枪杆子里面出政权’的英明论断说出了革命人民的心里话。这个伟大的真理指出了革命人民取得彻底解放的光明大道。”
    民卫团员弗朗索瓦说：“历史经验证明，帝国主义和反动派永远不会把独立和自由恩赐给被压迫人民的。要争取独立，只有依靠人民自己的力量，拿起枪杆子同敌人展开针锋相对的斗争。”
    他接着说：“毛主席说，‘凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。’要打倒帝国主义和一切反动派，靠什么？赤手空拳闹革命，敌人永远不会被打倒，革命永远不会胜利。只有按照毛主席的教导，用人民的革命武装对付帝国主义及其走狗的反革命武装。这样，不仅已经出现一个新中国，也必将出现一个新世界。”
    民卫团员安东尼说：“毛主席亲手缔造、领导和培育的中国人民解放军，是世界上最强大最模范的革命军队。毛主席为中国人民解放军制定的政治路线和军事路线具有普遍的世界意义。学习毛泽东思想，向中国人民解放军学习，是一切革命军队努力的方向。”
