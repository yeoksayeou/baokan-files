Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Staff of the People's Army strongly condemn the U.S. imperialist's consecutive bombing of Hanoi. They call on the people to bravely fight and decisively defeat the U.S. imperialists. Hanoi's military and civilians shot down nine U.S. aggressor planes in two days.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 12th, strongly condemning the U.S. dispatch of aircraft to bomb the transportation hub of Long Bien Bridge and residential areas in and around Hanoi on August 11th and 12th, committing new barbaric crimes.

	The statement said that this is a very serious new act of "escalation" by U.S. imperialism.

	The statement pointed out that these barbaric bombings followed U.S. President Johnson's decision to send more U.S. troops to South Vietnam and to pressure vassal countries to send more mercenary troops to South Vietnam. This shows that U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly intensifying and expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. This action further exposes the extremely brutal and warlike nature of U.S. imperialism and shatters the deceitful rhetoric of the Johnson administration about "peace talks."

	The statement said that any "escalation" by U.S. imperialism against North Vietnam will not save it from its inevitable failure in South Vietnam. On the contrary, the more crazed and vicious U.S. imperialism becomes, the more it will deepen the hatred of the Vietnamese people towards it, and the more it will strengthen their resolve to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of their homeland, and to give it the punishment it deserves. The statement warns the U.S. government that it must bear full responsibility for all consequences resulting from its new "escalation" actions.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 13th: The General Staff of the People's Army of Vietnam issued a communiqué on August 12th, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressors' consecutive dispatch of aircraft to attack Hanoi on August 11th and 12th, committing the crime of "escalation" by indiscriminately bombing and strafing residential areas and Long Bien Bridge.

	The communiqué warmly praised the bravery of Hanoi's military and civilians in shooting down nine enemy planes, damaging several, and killing or capturing multiple U.S. air pirates. The communiqué once again sternly warned the U.S. aggressors: the more they struggle and escalate the war, attempting to save themselves from the crisis of their inevitable failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the more they will suffer even more humiliating and disastrous defeats.

	The communiqué calls on all Vietnamese military and civilians to strengthen their resolve for decisive victory, to bravely advance, and to defeat all the U.S. aggressors' "escalation" plots, fighting to the final victory.

	According to the New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: U.S. aggressor planes again invaded the airspace over Hanoi on August 12th, launching three consecutive attacks on the city center and suburbs, and bombing the Long Bien Bridge, a key transportation route from Hanoi to other areas.

	The U.S. aggressors received their due punishment. As soon as the aggressor planes flew over Hanoi, the well-prepared military and civilians of Hanoi immediately launched a fierce counterattack with heavy artillery fire, shooting down seven aggressor planes and killing or capturing multiple U.S. air pirates.

	Including the two enemy planes shot down on the 11th, a total of nine U.S. aggressor planes have been destroyed by Hanoi's military and civilians in the people's war in just two days.

    越南外交部和人民军总司令部强烈谴责美帝接连轰炸河内
    号召人民奋勇作战坚决打败美帝
    河内军民两天内击落美国强盗飞机九架
    新华社河内十二日电  越南民主共和国外交部十二日发表声明，强烈谴责美国派遣飞机，在八月十一日和十二日两天接连多次轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内通往外地的交通要道龙边桥和河内市区、郊区的一些居民区的新的野蛮罪行。
    声明说，这是美帝国主义的极其严重的一次新的战争“升级”。
    声明指出，这些野蛮的轰炸，是紧接美国总统约翰逊决定向越南南方增派美国侵略军和胁迫各仆从国向越南南方增派帮凶军之后进行的。这表明，美帝国主义仍然在顽固地加强和扩大侵略越南的战争。这一行动进一步暴露了美帝国主义极其残暴的好战面目，戳穿了约翰逊政府关于“和平谈判”的狡诈论调。
    声明说，美帝国主义对越南北方的任何冒险的“升级”，也挽救不了它在越南南方的必然失败。相反，美帝国主义越是疯狂和凶恶，就越使越南人民加深对它的仇恨，更加增强为祖国的独立和自由战斗到底的决心，坚决给它以应得的惩罚。声明警告美国政府必须对由它的新的战争“升级”行动造成的一切后果负全部责任。
    新华社河内十三日电  越南人民军总司令部十二日发表公报，强烈谴责美国强盗在八月十一日和十二日接连多次派遣飞机袭击河内市，滥肆轰炸、扫射居民区和龙边桥的战争“升级”罪行。
    公报热烈表扬河内军民勇敢战斗，击落敌机九架，击伤多架，消灭和活捉美国飞贼多名的辉煌战功。公报再一次严厉警告美国强盗：它越是进行挣扎和战争“升级”，妄图挽救它在侵略越南战争中的困境和彻底失败的危机，就必将遭到更加惨重和可耻的失败。
    公报号召越南全体军民增强决战决胜意志，奋勇前进，打败美国强盗的一切战争“升级”阴谋，战斗到最后胜利。
    据新华社河内十二日电　美国强盗飞机十二日又三次侵入越南民主共和国首都河内市上空，疯狂袭击市中心区和郊区，并且轰炸河内通往外地的交通要道——龙边大桥。
    美国侵略者遭到了应得的惩罚。当强盗飞机刚一飞临河内上空，严阵以待的河内军民，就用猛烈炮火立即给予迎头痛击，共击落强盗飞机七架，消灭和活捉美国飞贼多名。
    连同十一日击落的两架敌机在内，两天里，已有九架美国强盗飞机葬身在河内军民人民战争的汪洋大海中。
