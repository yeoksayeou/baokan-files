	The Party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth,
	Parents' love is not as dear as Chairman Mao's,
	Nothing is as good as socialism,
	Class solidarity is deeper than rivers and seas...

	The plateau brings good news, and the nation rejoices.
	Qinghai and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	are forever united in heart.
	Qinghai and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	are forever one family!

	In recent days, red waves have carried greetings,
	and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	have used the most beautiful words
	to congratulate the establishment of the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee,
	celebrating the new great victory of invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	In recent days, the nation has rejoiced in new victories,
	and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	have used the most sincere words
	to express their deepest class feelings of unity,
	fighting together, and winning together with the "August 18th" fighters.

	This is the support of comrades in arms!
	This is the encouragement of comrades in arms!
	It is the boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao,
	and the boundless faith and admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought,
	that make Qinghai and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	unite closely and fight together at all times.
	It is the boundless hatred and contempt for the bourgeois headquarters,
	and the boundless disgust and scorn for the capitalist roaders represented by China's Khrushchev,
	that make Qinghai and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide
	share joys and sorrows, breathe together, and fight side by side to achieve victory.

	We will never forget that it was the revolutionary young guards from Chairman Mao's side
	who fanned the flames of revolution and ignited the spark of revolution,
	fighting alongside the revolutionary pioneers of Qinghai's "August 18th"
	to break through the stifling atmosphere that once hung over the plateau!

	We will never forget that it was the "January Revolution" storm that originated in Shanghai
	that inspired us to launch a general offensive against the capitalist roaders within the Party!

	We will never forget the steadfast resolve and fearless spirit
	of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan region
	to defend Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao,
	which inspired us to achieve new victories in the thorough destruction of the bourgeois headquarters!
	We will never forget that in the days of white terror created by the capitalist roaders within the Party,
	when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Qinghai was on the verge of being strangled,
	the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from all over the country gave us the most resolute support and assistance!

	The practice of struggle has made us deeply realize that
	without the support of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide,
	there would be no victory for Qinghai today.

	Today, as we celebrate the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee,
	we look at the nation and see a great situation;
	the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide have created heroic deeds
	and established immortal merits in the decisive battle between the two classes,
	two roads, and two lines.
	We have an even deeper understanding that the victories we have already achieved
	are merely the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles;
	our contribution to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat nationwide is indeed very small.
	We firmly remember Chairman Mao's repeated instructions:
	"Even if our work has achieved extremely great results,
	there is no reason to be proud and arrogant."
	We deeply understand that in the face of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide,
	we are forever students, and our task is to learn, learn, and learn again,
	with no reason to be proud and arrogant at all.

	We must humbly learn from the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Beijing,
	Shanghai, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guizhou, and other places
	who have created great achievements and many valuable experiences.

	We must humbly learn from the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Hubei,
	Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and other places
	who have become stronger and stronger in the fierce struggle between the two headquarters and two lines,
	and have shown great revolutionary fearlessness.

	Learn from them: to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher,
	to insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works,
	to firmly use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything,
	to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought,
	and to make Qinghai a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Learn from them: to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview,
	to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness,
	to further strengthen the construction and unity of the revolutionary ranks,
	to strive to consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution,
	and to seize, hold, and use power for the proletariat.

	Learn from them: to firmly grasp the direction of struggle,
	to unite the broad masses, and to carry out deeper and broader revolutionary criticism and struggle,
	to wage a people's war to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters,
	to achieve new merits and new achievements in carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

	Learn from them: to strictly implement the Party's policies,
	to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres and masses,
	to dare to "liberate a large area" while resolutely striking down "a handful,"
	to be good at winning over and uniting the deceived masses,
	and to form the broadest army of the proletarian cultural revolution.

	Learn from them: to raise the banner of "support the army and love the people" even higher,
	to raise the banner of "grasp revolution, promote production" even higher,
	to unite the military and the people with one heart,
	and to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Modesty helps one to make progress, while arrogance leads to backwardness.
	We must always remember this truth."
	We must be good students of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide,
	and humbly learn from the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide.
	In the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat,
	we will forge ourselves into true steel warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao,
	loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    向全国无产阶级革命派学习
    ——《青海日报》八月十五日社论
    “天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如社会主义好，河深海深不如阶级友爱深……”高原传喜讯，全国齐欢腾，青海—全国无产阶级革命派永远心连心，青海—全国无产阶级革命派永远是一家人！
    连日来，红色电波传祝词，全国的无产阶级革命派，用最美好的言语，祝贺青海省革命委员会成立，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。
    连日来，祖国四方庆新捷，全国的无产阶级革命派，用最真挚的言语，表达了同“八·一八”战士团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起的最深厚的阶级情意。
    这是战友的支持！这是战友的鼓励！是对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，是对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限崇拜，使青海—全国的无产阶级革命派紧紧团结在一起，时刻战斗在一起。这是对资产阶级司令部的无比憎恨、无比仇视，是对以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的无比厌恶、无比鄙夷，使青海—全国的无产阶级革命派永远甘苦与共、呼吸相关，并肩打击敌人，共同夺取胜利。
    我们永远不会忘记，是来自毛主席身旁的革命小将，煽革命之风，点革命之火，和青海“八·一八”革命闯将一起战斗，冲破了曾经笼罩在高原上空的“万马齐喑”的沉闷空气！
    我们永远不会忘记，是发源于上海的“一月革命”风暴，鼓舞着我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，发动了夺权的总攻击！
    我们永远不会忘记，武汉地区无产阶级革命派誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的坚定决心和大无畏精神，鼓舞着我们夺取彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的新胜利！我们永远不会忘记，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派制造的白色恐怖的日子里，在青海无产阶级文化大革命面临被扼杀的紧要关头，全国各地无产阶级革命派对我们最坚决的声援和支持！
    斗争的实践，使我们深深地认识到，离开了全国无产阶级革命派的支持，就没有青海今天的胜利。
    今天，当我们欢庆省革命委员会成立的时候，放眼看全国，全国一派大好形势；全国无产阶级革命派在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战中，创造了可歌可颂的英雄业绩，立下了可钦可佩的不朽功勋。我们越加深刻地认识到，我们已经取得的胜利，只不过是万里长征走完了第一步；我们对全国无产阶级文化大革命的贡献，确实是非常微小的。我们牢牢记着毛主席的谆谆教导：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”我们深深懂得，在全国无产阶级革命派面前，我们永远是小学生，我们的任务是学习学习再学习，决没有丝毫可以骄傲自大的理由。
    我们一定要万分虚心地向创建了丰功伟绩，创造了许多宝贵经验的北京、上海、山东、黑龙江、山西、贵州等地的无产阶级革命派学习。
    我们一定要万分虚心地向在两个司令部、两条路线激烈斗争中愈战愈强，表现了革命大无畏精神的湖北、湖南、河南、江西、四川、内蒙古等地的无产阶级革命派学习。
    学习他们：更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚定不移地用毛泽东思想统帅一切、推动一切、改造一切，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把青海办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    学习他们：用毛泽东思想改造世界观，大破私字，大立公字，进一步加强革命派队伍的建设和团结，努力巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，为无产阶级夺好权，掌好权，用好权。
    学习他们：牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结广大群众，开展更深入、更广泛的革命大批判、大斗争，打一场彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的人民战争，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底立新功，建新劳。
    学习他们：不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策，相信和依靠干部和群众的大多数，在坚决打击“一小撮”的同时，敢于“解放一大片”，善于争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众，组成一支最广泛的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    学习他们：更高地举起“拥军爱民”旗帜，更高地举起“抓革命，促生产”的旗帜，军民团结一条心，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”我们一定要当好全国无产阶级革命派的小学生，永远虚心地向全国无产阶级革命派学习，在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，把自己造就成无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的真正的钢铁战士！
