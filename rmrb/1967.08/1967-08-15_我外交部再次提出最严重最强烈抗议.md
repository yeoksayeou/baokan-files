The British authorities in Hong Kong have been continually creating provocations in the border areas of Man Kam To and Lo Wu, causing serious tension. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has once again lodged the strongest and most severe protest.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has sternly demanded that the British government order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately cancel all measures to block the border, stop provocations, and ensure the safety of border residents. They must respect the rights of the residents to study and propagate the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, as well as the rights to post slogans and big-character posters. Otherwise, the British government will be held responsible for all consequences.

New China News Agency, August 14th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires in China on August 14th, strongly protesting the British authorities in Hong Kong for continually creating provocations in the border areas of Man Kam To and Lo Wu, escalating the disruption of normal border order, and causing serious tension at the border. The full text of the note is as follows:

British Chargé d'Affaires in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China requests that the British Chargé d'Affaires immediately convey the following to the British government.

In recent days, the British authorities in Hong Kong have continually created provocations in the border areas of Man Kam To and Lo Wu, causing a new serious situation at the border.

On August 5th, workers from our side at Man Kam To, according to traditional customs, pushed carts to transport goods across the border. The British military and police in Hong Kong tore down the slogans and big-character posters they had posted the day before and threatened the workers with gunfire. After our workers reasoned with them, a British official in Hong Kong made three guarantees to the workers and signed a guarantee letter. On August 10th, the British authorities in Hong Kong blatantly violated their own guarantees, mobilized a large number of military and police, called in reactionary reporters, and deliberately created new provocations. The British military and police in Hong Kong not only set up barbed wire to block traffic but also tore down the slogans and big-character posters posted by our workers again. They also set up machine guns, surrounded, and threatened our workers. The British military and police even drew their guns ready to shoot at the crowd. Our workers, in self-defense, bravely fought back and seized the weapons from the British military and police. Under the stern questioning of our workers, the British responsible officials, out of words, had to admit their mistakes, publicly apologize, and sign another letter of admission of guilt. In addition to reaffirming the three guarantees of August 5th, they also guaranteed to remove all obstacles affecting traffic and compensate for the losses suffered by our workers.

After failing in their provocations at Man Kam To, the British authorities in Hong Kong brazenly announced on August 11th that, except for Lo Wu, all borders would be sealed off. Not only did they once again dishonorably tear up the guarantees they had just written, but they also disrupted the entire border's customary traffic, hindered the production and normal life of residents on both sides of the border, and infringed upon the traditional rights of residents on both sides.

The British authorities in Hong Kong's unreasonable sealing of the border has caused great indignation among border residents. On August 11th, when farmers from our side at Lo Wu crossed the border to farm according to traditional customs, they were stopped by British military and police. These British military and police even opened fire on our farmers and continuously fired more than twenty tear gas canisters, one of which landed in our territory, injuring three of our people. Only after our border guards fired warning shots did the British military and police stop shooting.

Since the armed provocation at Sha Tau Kok on July 8th, the British authorities in Hong Kong have not only failed to fulfill the three demands made by the Chinese government in the note of July 9th but have also continually created provocations at the border, escalating the disruption of normal border order and causing serious tension at the border. For this, the Chinese government once again lodges the strongest and most severe protest to the British government.

The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, while carrying out large-scale bloody suppression of our patriotic compatriots in the Hong Kong and Kowloon regions, implementing naked fascist white terror, are also continually creating provocations at the border and manufacturing tension. Your deliberate hostility towards the Chinese people will surely be met with severe punishment from the Chinese people.

The British government must order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately cancel all measures to block the border, stop provocations, and ensure the normal travel and personal safety of border residents. They must respect the rights of our people and Hong Kong and Kowloon residents to study and propagate the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, as well as the rights to post slogans and big-character posters. Otherwise, all consequences arising from this will be the responsibility of the British government.

    港英当局不断在文锦渡、罗坊等边境地区制造挑衅事件
    我外交部再次提出最严重最强烈抗议
    严正要求英国政府责成港英当局立即取消封锁边境的一切措施，停止挑衅，切实保证边境居民安全，尊重他们学习和宣传伟大的毛泽东思想以及贴标语和大字报等权利。否则，一切后果必须由英国政府负责。
    新华社十四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十四日照会英国驻华代办处，就香港英国当局不断在文锦渡、罗坊等边境地区制造挑衅事件，变本加厉地破坏边境正常秩序，造成边境上的严重紧张局势，再一次向英国政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：英国驻华代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部要求英国代办处立即把下列事项转告英国政府。
    连日来，香港英国当局不断在文锦渡、罗坊等边境地区制造挑衅事件，造成边境上新的严重局势。
    八月五日，文锦渡我方搬运工人按照传统习惯，推车运送货物过境，香港英国军警竟撕毁他们前一天贴的标语和大字报，并且无理开枪威胁工人。经我工人说理斗争后，香港英国负责官员向工人作了三项保证，并签署了保证书。八月十日，香港英国当局公然违背自己的保证，调动了大批军警，召来了反动记者，有计划、有预谋地制造了新的挑衅事件。香港英国军警不但设置铁丝网，阻塞交通，而且又一次撕毁了我工人贴的标语和大字报，并且架设机枪，包围和威胁我工人群众。英国军警还悍然拔枪准备向群众射击。我工人出于自卫，英勇斗争，夺下了英国军警手中的武器。在我工人严正质问下，英国负责官员理屈词穷，不得不承认错误，公开赔礼道歉，又一次签署了认罪保证书，除重申八月五日三项保证外，并且保证拆除一切影响交通的障碍物和赔偿我方工人所受损失。
    香港英国当局在文锦渡挑衅失败之后，竟悍然于八月十一日宣布除罗湖外，封锁全部边境，不但再次毫无信义地撕毁了自己刚刚写下的保证，而且破坏了整个边境的习惯交通，妨碍了边境双方居民的生产劳动和正常生活，侵犯了双方居民的传统权益。
    香港英国当局无理封锁边境，引起了边境居民的极大愤慨。八月十一日，当罗坊我方农民群众按照传统习惯过境耕作时，遭到英国军警阻止。这些英国军警竟向我方农民开枪射击，并连续发射了二十多枚催泪弹，其中一枚射入我境内，打伤了我方群众三人。经我边防哨兵鸣枪警告，英国军警始停止射击。
    香港英国当局继七月八日沙头角武装挑衅以来，不但迄今没有履行中国政府七月九日照会中所提三项要求，反而在边境不断制造挑衅事件，以至变本加厉地破坏边境的正常秩序，造成边境上严重的紧张局势。为此，中国政府再一次向英国政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    英国政府和香港英国当局一面在港九地区大规模地血腥镇压我爱国同胞，实行赤裸裸的法西斯白色恐怖，一面又在边境上不断挑衅，制造紧张局势。你们这样蓄意同中国人民为敌，必将受到中国人民严厉的惩罚。
    英国政府必须责成香港英国当局立即取消封锁边境的一切措施，停止挑衅，切实保证边境居民的正常往来和人身安全，尊重我方群众和港九居民学习和宣传伟大的毛泽东思想以及贴标语和大字报等权利。否则，由此而引起的一切后果，必须由英国政府负责。
                中华人民共和国外交部
          一九六七年八月十四日于北京
