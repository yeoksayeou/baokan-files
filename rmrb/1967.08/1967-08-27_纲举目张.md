The revolutionary criticism is the central task of all work at present.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In any region, there cannot be many central tasks at the same time. At a given time, there can only be one central task, with other tasks as second or third in importance."

Currently, there are many tasks for us proletarian revolutionaries to grasp. Among the myriad tasks, what is the key link that drives everything is the revolutionary criticism. Among countless tasks, revolutionary criticism is the first and foremost.

Only by focusing on revolutionary criticism can we better promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. The great unity and alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries are formed, consolidated, and developed in the course of common struggle. Only by standing at the forefront of revolutionary criticism and holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism can the genuine revolutionary leftists forever maintain their revolutionary vigor.

Only by focusing on revolutionary criticism can we truly educate, win over, and unite the deceived masses, thereby strengthening and expanding the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries. If we do not go through revolutionary criticism to draw a clear line between ourselves and the capitalist-roaders in power within the party and between ourselves and the reactionary bourgeois line, the deceived masses will not truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in their thoughts. If the deceived masses do not truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in their thoughts, the development and strengthening of the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries will be mere empty talk. Even if they join the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries organizationally, they have not joined in their thoughts. Not only will this not strengthen the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries, but it will also weaken them.

Only by focusing on revolutionary criticism can we truly identify and examine cadres, understand the political situation of the cadre corps, identify who are the proletarian cadres in power, who are the capitalist-roaders in power, and who are the cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-party and anti-socialist and who are incorrigible, thereby creating further conditions for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Only by focusing on revolutionary criticism can we truly raise high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people." The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, fighting side by side in the revolutionary criticism, uniting against the enemy, loving each other, hating each other, thinking alike, and working together, can make the relations between the army and the people even more intimate.

Only by focusing on revolutionary criticism can we truly arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, raise class consciousness, invigorate the revolutionary spirit, and boost revolutionary vigor, thereby implementing the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and making production more, faster, better, and more economical.

In summary, revolutionary criticism is the key to all current tasks. When the key is grasped, everything falls into place. By focusing on revolutionary criticism, we can drive everything forward and develop all aspects of work vigorously. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionaries, especially the leaders of revolutionary organizations in various units, must firmly grasp this key link, avoid blindness, avoid bureaucratism, eliminate all interference, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. In this way, we can smash all the enemy's plots and tricks, achieve victory in the struggle for power, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

### 纲举目张

    纲举目张
    革命的大批判，是当前一切工作的中心。
    毛主席教导我们：“在任何一个地区内，不能同时有许多中心工作，在一定时间内只能有一个中心工作，辅以别的第二位、第三位的工作。”
    当前，我们无产阶级革命派要抓的工作很多。千头万绪，带动一切的中心一环是什么，就是革命的大批判。千条万条，革命的大批判是第一条。
    只有抓住革命的大批判，才能更好地促进无产阶级革命派的大联合。无产阶级革命派的大团结、大联合，是在共同的斗争中形成、巩固和发展的。真正的革命左派只有站在革命大批判的第一线，高举革命的批判的大旗，才能永葆革命的青春。
    只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正教育、争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众，壮大和发展无产阶级革命派的队伍。如果不是经过革命的大批判，同党内走资本主义道路的当权派彻底划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线彻底划清界限，受蒙蔽的群众就不能真正从思想上回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。而如果不是从思想上真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，无产阶级革命派队伍的发展和壮大，就只是一句空话，或者组织上虽然加入了无产阶级革命派的行列，但是思想上并没有加入，不但不能壮大无产阶级革命派的队伍，反而会削弱它。
    只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正的识别和考察干部，弄清干部队伍的政治状况，识别谁是无产阶级当权派，谁是走资本主义道路当权派，谁是犯有错误但不是反党反社会主义和屡教不改的干部，为革命的“三结合”进一步创造条件。
    只有抓住革命的大批判，才能更高地举起“拥军爱民”的旗帜。无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员，在革命的大批判中，并肩战斗，团结对敌，爱到一起、恨到一起、想到一起、干到一起，就能使军民关系更加鱼水相亲。
    只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正激发起广大职工的革命热情，提高阶级觉悟，振作革命精神，鼓足革命干劲，贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把生产搞得又多、又快、又好、又省。
    总之，革命大批判是当前各项工作的纲。纲举则目张。抓住了革命的大批判，我们就能带动一切，把各方面的工作都蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。无产阶级革命派的战友们，特别是各个单位革命组织的负责人，一定要紧紧抓住这个中心环节，避免盲目性，避免事务主义，排除一切干扰，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。这样，我们就能粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计，取得夺权斗争的胜利，取得革命、生产的双胜利。
