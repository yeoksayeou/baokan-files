Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor."

Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor. After our school's proletarian revolutionary faction achieved initial success in the struggle for power, revolutionary cadres, as an indispensable revolutionary force, have become increasingly important. To further thoroughly liberate revolutionary cadres and fully utilize their immense role in the current struggle to resume classes and make revolution, the key lies in boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres.

Chairman Mao instructs us to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres is precisely a manifestation and practice of Chairman Mao's teaching.

Through more than a year of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the class lines among cadres have basically become clear. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, represented by Zhang Gao, have been exposed. It has been proven that the majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. Based on this fundamental fact, believing in the majority of cadres is the basis for daring to boldly utilize revolutionary cadres.

Over a year of experience in the Cultural Revolution has also proven that we not only need to believe in the majority of cadres but must also rely on the majority of cadres. Revolutionary cadres are a precious asset of the proletarian revolutionary cause. They are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, and have richer fighting experience. Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres and absorbing them into various levels of leadership teams is not only an important measure to ensure the vigorous development of our various tasks but also a key to consolidating our young proletarian regime. Without revolutionary cadres, the Red Guards might seize power today but could lose it tomorrow.

Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres is not just a matter of work methods but is an important indicator of whether or not one adheres to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Currently, some grassroots units and comrades do not fully recognize the importance of boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres. Although they verbally claim to "liberate a large area," they do not dare to let cadres come out to work. Such "liberation" is completely useless. Only by boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres and allowing them to play their due roles in actual work can the goal of liberation be achieved.

Some comrades, especially those who are unwilling to let cadres who have made serious mistakes but are not beyond redemption come out to work, are also wrong. Chairman Mao points out: "As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who persist in not changing and are incorrigible, they should be allowed to change and encouraged to redeem themselves with meritorious deeds." The mistakes of these cadres can only be corrected in actual struggle, and they can only redeem themselves with meritorious deeds in actual work. For these people, we must see their present and future, not repeat the "self-cultivation" approach, making them "reflect in seclusion," nor act like the "pseudo-foreign devils," not allowing others to make revolution. Instead, we must follow Chairman Mao's cadre policy, warmly encourage and patiently help them to sincerely correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres is not simply a matter of restoring their original positions. How to utilize them should be decided through group discussions.

Just as with all things in the world, cadres are also divided into two parts. This division is a universal law of development. Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres does not mean that cadres will not change in the future. We can foresee this and be prepared. As the revolution develops, we will eliminate a few corrupt elements and continuously select those outstanding cadres who are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, loyal to the dictatorship of the proletariat, closely connected with the masses, and constantly advancing, and promote them to leadership positions.

All cadres who are willing to make revolution, take active action, and join the broad ranks of Wei Dong warriors to fight together, achieve new victories, and build new achievements in the struggle to resume classes and make revolution, and seize new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

Editor's Note: The article by the editorial board of Nankai University's "Wei Dong" raises an important issue of general significance after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. As this article points out, boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres "is an important indicator of whether or not one adheres to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Allowing more revolutionary cadres to come out to work is a necessity for the current revolutionary situation and an indispensable factor in strengthening and consolidating the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs. Revolutionary mass organizations tempered in the storm of class struggle are the fresh blood of our revolutionary cadre team. However, it should be noted that the revolutionary youngsters are still politically immature and lack rich fighting experience. If the revolutionary youngsters do not combine with revolutionary cadres, the power seized by the proletarian revolutionary faction will be difficult to consolidate. As this article sharply points out: "If there are no revolutionary cadres, the Red Guards might seize power today but could lose it tomorrow."

Boldly utilizing revolutionary cadres must not stop at mere words but must allow them to fully play their roles in actual work. Of course, this does not mean that all cadres should be restored to their original positions and everything should remain the same. Based on the specific circumstances of revolutionary cadres and through group discussions, they should be assigned appropriate work. The proletarian revolutionary faction should warmly support and encourage them and help them improve their work style, establishing a brand-new, revolutionary relationship between cadres and the masses.

### 要大胆使用革命干部

    要大胆使用革命干部
    《卫东》编辑部评论员
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”
    “政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”我校无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争初步胜利后，革命干部作为不可缺少的一支革命队伍，显得越来越重要。要进一步彻底解放广大革命干部，在当前的复课闹革命中充分发挥广大革命干部的巨大作用，关键就在于要大胆使用革命干部。
    毛主席指示我们，要相信和依靠干部的大多数。大胆使用革命干部，正是充分体现和实践了毛主席的这个教导。
    通过一年多来轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动，干部的阶级阵线基本上分明了，以臧高为代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派被揪了出来，事实证明，我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的，立足于这样一个基本事实，相信干部的大多数，才敢于大胆使用革命干部。
    一年多来文化大革命的经验还证明，我们不但要相信干部的大多数，而且必须依靠干部的大多数。革命干部是无产阶级革命事业的宝贵财富，他们政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，斗争经验比较丰富。大胆使用革命干部，吸收他们参加各级领导班子，不仅是保证我们各项工作有力开展的一项重要措施，而且是巩固我们无产阶级年青政权的关键。如果没有革命的干部，红卫兵小将今天夺了权，明天就有可能丧失政权。
    大胆使用革命干部，不单单是个工作方法问题，而是坚持不坚持毛主席革命路线的一个重要标志。目前，有些基层，有些同志，对于大胆使用革命干部的重要性认识不足。他们虽然口头上也说要“解放一大片”，但是又不敢让干部出来参加工作，这样的“解放”是完全没有用的，只有大胆使用革命干部，让他们在实际工作中发挥应有的作用，才算达到了解放的目的。
    有的同志，特别不愿意让那些虽然犯有严重错误，但还不是不可救药的干部出来工作，这也是不对的。毛主席指出：“只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。”这些干部的错误只能在实际斗争中得以改正，他们也只能在实际工作中来将功赎罪。对于这些人要看到他们的现在和将来，不能再重复《修养》那一套，让他们去“闭门思过”，更不能象“假洋鬼子”，不允许别人革命，而要按照毛主席的干部政策，热情鼓励和耐心帮助他们，使他们心悦诚服改正错误，回到毛主席革命路线上来。
    大胆使用革命干部，不是一般的官复原职，如何使用，应该通过群众讨论。
    正同世界上一切事物一样，干部也是一分为二的。一分为二，这是事物发展的普遍规律。大胆使用革命干部，并不是说干部将来就不会有变化。我们预见到这一点，就可以心中有数。随着革命的发展，淘汰个别腐化分子，不断将那些忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的、忠于无产阶级专政的、密切联系群众的、不断前进的优秀干部，选拔到领导岗位上来。
    一切愿意革命的干部，积极行动起来，和广大卫东战士共同战斗，在复课闹革命中，立新功，建新劳，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。

    编者按：南开大学《卫东》编辑部评论员的这篇文章，提出了在无产阶级革命派掌权后一个具有普遍意义的重要问题。
    毛主席教导我们：要相信和依靠干部的大多数。正如这篇文章所说，大胆地使用革命干部，“是坚持不坚持毛主席革命路线的一个重要标志”。
    让更多的革命干部站出来工作，是当前革命形势发展的需要，是加强和巩固革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的一个不可缺少的因素。在阶级斗争大风大浪中锻炼出来的革命群众组织的代表，是我们革命干部队伍的新鲜血液。但是，应该看到，革命小将在政治上还不很成熟，还缺乏丰富的斗争经验。如果革命小将不和革命干部相结合，那么无产阶级革命派夺得的权就很难巩固。正如这篇文章所尖锐指出的：“如果没有革命的干部，红卫兵小将今天夺了权，明天就有可能丧失政权。”
    大胆地使用革命干部，决不能只停留在口头上，而必须让他们在实际工作中充分地发挥作用。当然，这决不意味着干部都统统官复原职、一仍旧章。应该根据革命干部的具体情况，经过群众讨论，让他们担任适当的工作。无产阶级革命派应当热情地支持和鼓励他们，并且帮助他们改进工作作风，建立崭新的、革命的干群关系。
