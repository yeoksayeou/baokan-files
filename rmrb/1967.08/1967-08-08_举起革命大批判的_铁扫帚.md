	Wield the "Iron Broom" of Revolutionary Criticism
	Metallurgical Industry Ministry Office	Defend Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line United Combat Team

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The current struggle and criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is a matter of the utmost importance. Whether or not one cares about this revolutionary criticism movement, and whether or not one participates in it, is indeed a major issue concerning whether or not the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be carried through to the end.

	Why is revolutionary criticism so important? This is because merely defeating the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party organizationally does not mean defeating them politically, ideologically, and theoretically; only by completely defeating them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and eliminating their poisonous influence, can we truly defeat them. Only then can we achieve a thorough and reliable victory, and only then can we seize power that is truly reliable. Otherwise, although they have been removed from their positions, their ideological influence has not been eliminated, and although their organizational power has been seized, their political, ideological, and theoretical power has not been seized. In other words, their pernicious influence among the broad masses has not been eliminated. If we do not carry out revolutionary criticism, do not eliminate this influence, and do not seize their power politically, ideologically, and theoretically, they can use this power to stage a comeback and regain their positions. There are many historical lessons of this kind.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. All the reactionaries mentioned above look terrible, but in fact, they are not. From a long-term point of view, it is not in the interests of the Americans for their interference in Taiwan to be made public. In reality, it is not the Americans who are afraid of the Chinese people, but the Chinese reactionaries who are afraid of the Chinese people. As we often say, 'the monster is paper-made,' it is easily torn. This is also like sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not go away by itself." Revolutionary criticism is an iron broom with tremendous power. It can thoroughly sweep away the various poisons spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party that remain in people's minds.

	We, the revolutionary masses of the Metallurgical Industry Ministry, are determined to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with revolutionary comrades nationwide and in the metallurgical system, launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the metallurgical system! We are determined to thoroughly eliminate their poisonous influence politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly destroy their bases for restoration.

    举起革命大批判的“铁扫帚”
    冶金部机关　捍卫毛主席革命路线联合战斗团
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”当前正在进行的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，就是头等重要的国家大事，关心不关心这个革命大批判运动，投入不投入这个革命大批判运动，的确是关系到能不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。
    革命的大批判为什么如此重要？这是因为我们从组织上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打倒，并不等于从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们打倒；只有从政治上、思想上、理论上完全把他们打倒，肃清了他们的流毒，这才是真正彻底的打倒。这样取得的胜利，才是彻底可靠的胜利，这样夺过来的权，才是真正可靠的权。否则，虽然他们人下了台，但他们的思想影响并没有下台，他们组织上的权虽然被夺了，但他们在政治上、思想上、理论上的权还没有夺。也就是说，他们在广大群众中的恶劣影响还没有清除。如果不进行革命的大批判，不清除这种影响，如果不从政治上、思想上、理论上夺他们的权，他们就可以利用这个权，卷土重来，重新上台。这样的历史教训是很多的。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”革命的大批判，就是威力无比的铁扫帚，它可以把留在人们头脑中的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散布的各种流毒，来一次彻底的大扫除。
    我们冶金部的无产阶级革命派决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，同全国和冶金系统广大革命同志一道，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及冶金系统一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火！决心从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底清除他们的流毒，彻底摧毁他们进行复辟的基地。
