The People's of China and Albania March Forward Side by Side in the Struggle Against Imperialism and Revisionism

Albanian Ambassador Hosts Banquet for Returning Chinese Red Guards Delegation

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Jiang Qing, and others were invited to attend.

The banquet was filled with a revolutionary atmosphere of friendship, presenting a moving scene of brotherly unity. Comrades from both countries repeatedly raised their glasses and toasted each other. "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" were the heartfelt cheers from both sides.

Ambassador Natanaili and Comrade Yao Wenyuan both spoke at the banquet. Comrade Zhou Enlai also delivered a warm speech.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his speech, "I, on behalf of Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Jiang Qing, and myself, extend greetings to you from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao! Through you, we also send our greetings to the heroic Albanian people and to the great leader of the Albanian people and close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

Comrade Zhou Enlai proposed a toast: "To the eternal friendship between the peoples, parties, governments, and armies of China and Albania, to the new fighting friendship established between the Chinese Red Guards and the Albanian revolutionary youth, to the health of the great leader of the Albanian people and close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and to the health of our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Ambassador Natanaili, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the parties, governments, and peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He particularly pointed out that this friendship is the result of the joint struggle of the peoples of China and Albania against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and against the reactionaries of all countries. It is the result of jointly defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and safeguarding the socialist system. He expressed his firm belief that no force in the world can destroy this friendship.

The ambassador warmly congratulated the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. He said that the victory of the Chinese people in opposing the capitalist roaders within the party has shattered the illusion of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists to restore capitalism in China. He said, "We have and will continue to fully support the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and we are fully convinced that this revolution, which has great historical significance not only for China but for the whole world, will achieve a thorough victory."

The ambassador said, "Born in the flames of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards are the best and most loyal students of Chairman Mao Zedong. Armed with the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, they have become a reliable new generation that will always hold high the banner of revolution and Marxism-Leninism. With such a new generation, great people's China will surely carry the revolution through to the end, and no force in the world can change its color."

Ambassador Natanaili said, "Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor of Albania, our country has seen an unprecedented revolutionary situation. Our people and youth have pushed the ideological and cultural revolution to a higher level, systematically and resolutely waging a struggle against the remnants of bourgeois and reactionary ideas. The broad masses of workers firmly and infinitely support the historic decisions made by the Fifth Party Congress, fighting for the construction of a socialist society and the defense of the motherland!"

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said in his speech, "It has been more than twenty days since the Chinese Red Guards delegation returned home, but the love of the Albanian people and youth for our great leader Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary enthusiasm they showed towards the Chinese people and youth, still remain vivid in our hearts, as if it were yesterday."

He said, "We Red Guards are greatly inspired and very happy about the achievements made by the Albanian people under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor. He said, "The friendship between our two countries' revolutionary people and revolutionary youth is the genuine friendship between proletarian revolutionaries, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is an unbreakable and tested revolutionary friendship. In the future, in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and against the reactionaries of all countries, the Chinese Red Guards will always fight side by side with the Albanian revolutionary youth, marching forward together!"

Comrade Yao Wenyuan strongly condemned the slander of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists against the Chinese Red Guards. He emphasized, "We Red Guards are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to hold high the great banner of proletarian internationalism, together with the revolutionary masses of the whole country, together with the revolutionary people and youth of Albania, together with the revolutionary people and youth of the world, to firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, to firmly support the struggle of Marxist-Leninists worldwide against modern revisionism, to fight to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and to strive for a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system!"

Those invited to the banquet also included members and representatives of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Capital Workers' Congress, the Capital Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards Congress of Higher Education Institutions, and the Red Guards Congress of Middle Schools, such as Wu De, Fu Chongbi, Nie Yuanzi, Ding Guanyi, Wang Laomin, Xu Kai, Zhang Guifu, Kuai Dafu, Hou Yushan, and Li Dongmin.

    姚文元同志强烈谴责美帝、苏修对中国红卫兵的诬蔑。他强调说，我们红卫兵决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举无产阶级国际主义的大旗，同全国无产阶级革命派一起，同阿尔巴尼亚革命人民和革命青年一起，同全世界革命人民和革命青年团结在一起，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，坚决支持世界马克思列宁主义者反对现代修正主义的斗争，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗！
