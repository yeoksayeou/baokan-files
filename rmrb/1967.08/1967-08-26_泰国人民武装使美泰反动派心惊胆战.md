In the face of the victorious development of the Thai people's armed struggle, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Thai reactionaries, have fallen into a state of panic and are plotting to intensify military repression.

The Thai puppet prime minister, Thanom, recently admitted that the Thai people's armed forces have "spread throughout various regions," and that the "main difficulty in the government's work of suppressing the insurgents is similar to the situation in South Vietnam." High-ranking Thai military officials have also admitted that the Thai people's armed forces are "extremely flexible," and that they are launching "organized guerrilla warfare." When the Thai reactionary military and police encounter the people's armed forces in the jungle, they are "like targets waiting to be hit."

In order to block news about the activities of the people's armed forces, the Thai reactionaries have now banned newspapers from publishing reports on this matter. However, the Thai people widely listen to the broadcasts of the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station and spread the news of the people's armed forces' victories.

Under the heavy blows of the Thai people's armed forces, the morale of the reactionary military and police has plummeted. In battle, the reactionary military and police often discard their uniforms and desert, with some even exchanging their uniforms and weapons for the clothes of villagers to facilitate their escape.

To intensify the repression of the people's armed forces, the Thai reactionary government has recently sought aid from U.S. imperialism and the Southeast Asia aggression bloc, while also deciding to increase police forces by six thousand. However, even the U.S. "Newsweek" magazine has had to admit: "The Thanom clique has failed in its first phase of action against the communists," and that "the situation in Thailand today is similar to when Ngo Dinh Diem fell."

    泰国人民武装使美泰反动派心惊胆战
    本报讯　在泰国人民武装斗争胜利发展的形势下，美帝国主义及其走狗泰国反动派已陷于一片惊慌，正在阴谋加紧军事镇压。
    泰国傀儡总理他侬最近承认，泰国人民武装力量“已布满各地区”，“政府在扫荡暴动分子工作上的主要困难，同南越情况相似”。泰国反动高级军官也承认，泰国人民武装力量是“极为灵活的”，他们正在展开“有组织的游击战”，当泰国反动军警在丛林里同人民武装遭遇时：“活象等着挨打的靶子”。
    为了封锁人民武装活动的消息，现在泰国反动派已禁止报纸刊登有关这方面的报道。但是，泰国人民却普遍收听“泰国人民之声”电台的广播，并且把人民武装的捷报奔走相告。
    在泰国人民武装的沉重打击下，傀儡集团的反动军警士气低落。在战斗中，反动军警经常脱去制服，开小差逃跑，有的还拿制服和枪枝去换村民的衣服，以便逃跑。
    为了加紧对人民武装的镇压，泰国反动政府最近一方面向美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团求援，一方面又决定扩充警察兵力六千人。但是，甚至连美国《新闻周刊》也不得不承认：“他侬集团在制止共产党第一阶段的行动方面遭到了失败”，今天“泰国的情况和吴庭艳垮台的时候相似。”
