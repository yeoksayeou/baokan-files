Revolutionary peoples of all countries hail Chairman Mao's establishment of the greatest proletarian military theory. Chairman Mao's military thought illuminates the path to victory for the world's revolutionary peoples. Establishing rural revolutionary base areas, using the countryside to encircle the cities, and ultimately seizing national power is the inevitable path to revolutionary victory.

	BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) — The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has established the most complete, most scientific, and greatest military theory, and formulated a truly proletarian military line. This is the pinnacle of Marxist-Leninist military thought. This is the most powerful weapon for the world's revolutionary peoples to defeat imperialism and all class enemies. Chairman Mao's military theory, like a beacon with rays of light, illuminates the revolutionary path for the world's peoples. The oppressed nations and peoples of the world enthusiastically hail Chairman Mao's great theory as the fundamental path to their complete liberation. More and more revolutionaries are striving to learn and apply this theory in practice, greatly promoting the development of the world's revolutionary cause.

	Firmly Take the Road of Armed Struggle to Seize Power Through Armed Struggle

	The revolutionary peoples of the world are increasingly deeply aware through their struggles that Chairman Mao's brilliant proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a universal truth. To achieve liberation, revolutionary violence must be used to overcome counter-revolutionary violence.

	The first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma, which has been engaged in armed struggle for nearly twenty years, Thakin Ba Tin, said: "We have been able to persist in the struggle because we have upheld Chairman Mao's thought on 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and because we have used the gun to oppose the thoughts and programs of the Chinese Khrushchov and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, which wanted us to cooperate with Ne Win and become Ne Win's disciples."

	A friend from South Vietnam, who is fighting on the front lines against the United States, said: "The greatest experience that the Chinese revolution has provided for the revolutionary struggles of colonial countries is that to achieve victory in the struggle for liberation, one must have a revolutionary armed force. The main spiritual force for our victory over American imperialism is Mao Zedong Thought."

	A friend from Congo (Kinshasa) summed up his bloody struggle experience, saying that some so-called friendly countries had urged them to engage in parliamentary struggle, with the result that many of their comrades were arrested, massacred, and executed. He said, the Congolese people must follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to fight. We are now holding high the banner of armed struggle, which is the only correct path to the liberation of our people.

	A freedom fighter from Zimbabwe said: "Our struggle experience has already proven the bankruptcy of some people's empty talk, who say that liberation can be achieved through peaceful means. We have come to realize that the only way for us to achieve liberation is to use the gun to fight against the gun."

	A Palestinian revolutionary fighter, who is bravely fighting against the aggression of American imperialism and its lackey Israel, firmly believes that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an unshakable truth. He said, "We have chosen armed struggle as the only path to liberate our homeland."

	A young man from Venezuela said: We have accepted the revolutionary experience of the Chinese people and the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong. Tens of thousands of young people have gone into the mountains, taken up arms, and fought against imperialism and reactionaries. The books of Chairman Mao are deeply engraved in our minds.

	The organ of the Communist Party of Bolivia, "Liberation," pointed out that the so-called "peaceful path" to seize power, which is touted by modern revisionists, has completely failed. "The peoples of various countries have come to understand through their own experiences that the only guarantee of their victory is to firmly take up the revolutionary gun."

	Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism. More and more revolutionaries around the world are striving to learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on establishing rural revolutionary base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing national power. They confidently say: "The Jian'gangshan road is the inevitable path to revolutionary victory."

	A friend from Sudan wrote in a poem full of revolutionary passion:

	"Great teacher!
	Your thought has armed all revolutionary peoples.
	We will hold high the red flag and follow you closely,
	Defeat the American imperialist wolves.
	We will take the road of encircling the cities from the countryside,
	And annihilate the enemy with big knives and spears."

	An Indonesian friend emphasized: The Indonesian people must overthrow the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution. Apart from following the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, there is no other way. To establish a people's democratic government, we must wage a people's war, establish revolutionary base areas in the countryside, wage a protracted war, rely on the peasant masses, carry out a land revolution, and in the struggle, implement the principle of self-reliance, unite all forces that can be united, encircle the cities, and ultimately achieve victory. We must resolutely abandon and completely eliminate all illusions and erroneous thoughts about the "peaceful path," "relying on the bourgeoisie," and other modern revisionist "theories" peddled by the Soviet leadership clique. We must implement Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings to us: "Use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war."

	A guerrilla fighter from Angola pointed out that China mobilized the peasants and started the revolution from rural base areas. We believe that the Chinese road is completely correct and very suitable for us.

	A leader of the peasant movement in Colombia said: "Peasants played a great role in the Chinese revolution. Our country is the same; peasants make up the majority. The reactionary army cannot leave the cities; once they enter the countryside, they are passive and suffer blows from the guerrillas everywhere. Chairman Mao's thought of encircling the cities from the countryside and ultimately seizing the cities is very correct and great."

	A friend from Brazil said enthusiastically: "I have been looking for a path to liberate Brazil for decades. Today, I have found it in China, and that is the Jian'gangshan road!"

	A friend from the Dominican Republic emphasized: "Without the Jian'gangshan of the past, there would be no victory for the Chinese revolution, no victory for the Dominican revolution, and no victory for the world revolution. The Jian'gangshan road is the inevitable path to revolutionary victory."

	Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world. Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is arming more and more revolutionary peoples, inspiring them to confidently defeat the enemy.

	The heroic Vietnamese people, in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation, are fighting stronger and stronger and have achieved great victories. Therefore, they feel particularly close to Mao Zedong Thought. A combat hero from South Vietnam said: "Chairman Mao's military thought is the most correct theory for the proletariat and oppressed nations to struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the magic weapon for the world's revolutionary peoples to defeat the enemy."

	The people of Laos, who are bravely fighting against the most ferocious American wolves, praise Chairman Mao's thought on people's war as "one of the greatest and most outstanding creations," which has made a very great contribution to the liberation movement of oppressed nations.

	A commander of the Albanian People's Army pointed out: "The Albanian People's Army attaches great importance to mastering Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. This thought has guiding significance for the military construction of Albania. The Party of Labor of Albania, based on the thought of people's war, implements universal armament and strengthens war preparedness. Therefore, although our country is small and surrounded and blockaded by imperialism and revisionism, we firmly believe that we are invincible."

	The organ of the National Liberation Committee of Congo (Kinshasa), "Revolution," emphasized in an article published in January this year that after summarizing the experiences and lessons of three years of struggle, we believe that the correct line is to execute Comrade Mao Zedong's great teachings on people's war according to the situation and specific conditions of our country.

	A British worker happily said: "Mao Zedong made us understand that the decisive factor in winning or losing a war is people, not weapons. It has broken the old notion of materialism and technology that the capitalist system has instilled in us in the past. It has also filled us with confidence in our own struggle."

	The political secretary of the Communist Vanguard Organization of Argentina, Elias Seman, emphasized: "Comrade Mao Zedong summed up the experiences of each period of the Chinese revolution and proposed the laws of people's war, which today have become the guide for the revolutionary actions of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

	As a seasoned commander of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army said, the Liberation Army, using Chairman Mao's military thought and tactical principles, fought close-range battles, night battles, and concentrated forces to fight annihilation battles, defeating the modernized American invading army. This proves that Chairman Mao's great military thought is invincible.

	Today, in Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Thailand, India, Malaya (including Singapore), and the Philippines, hundreds of millions of people are learning and applying Chairman Mao's military theory in the war. In Africa, the flames of armed struggle are burning in Congo (Kinshasa), Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and other central and southern African regions. Revolutionary fighters regard Chairman Mao's military works as "a beacon in the night." The fighters of Congo (Kinshasa) said that anything can be lost, but Mao Zedong's works must never be lost. In Latin America, which has long been regarded by American imperialism as its "backyard," revolutionaries in many countries are also taking up arms, carrying Mao Zedong's works, and entering the mountains and forests to fight. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant military theory, the flames of armed struggle of the world's revolutionary peoples will definitely burn more and more fiercely, ultimately burying imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries!

    各国革命人民欢呼毛主席创立了最伟大的无产阶级军事学说
    毛主席军事思想照亮世界人民革命胜利的道路
    建立农村革命根据地，用乡村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权是革命胜利必经之路
    新华社二十二日讯  中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席创立了最完整、最科学、最伟大的军事学说，制定了一条真正无产阶级的军事路线。这是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰。这是世界革命人民战胜帝国主义和一切阶级敌人的最强大的武器。毛主席的军事学说，象光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了世界人民的革命道路。全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民，热烈欢呼毛主席这一伟大学说是他们争取彻底解放的根本道路。越来越多的革命者正在努力学习并在实践中运用这个理论，极大地推动了世界人民革命事业的发展。
    坚决走武装斗争的道路  通过武装斗争夺取政权
    世界革命人民从斗争实践中日益深刻地体会到，毛主席提出的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一英明论断，是放之四海而皆准的真理。为了争取解放，必须用革命暴力来战胜反革命暴力。
    坚持武装斗争近二十年的缅甸共产党的中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶同志说：“我们所以能够坚持斗争，是由于我们树立了毛主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的思想，是由于我们使用了枪杆子，反对中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏修领导集团要我们同奈温合作、并做奈温的门徒的思想和纲领的结果。”
    战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南南方的一位朋友说：“中国革命为各殖民地国家的革命提供的最大经验是，要想取得解放斗争的胜利，必须有革命的武装力量。我们战胜美帝国主义的主要精神力量就是毛泽东思想。”
    刚果（金）一位朋友总结自己血的斗争教训说，一些所谓友好国家曾怂恿我们进行议会斗争，其结果使我们的许多同伙被捕，被屠杀，被枪决。他说，刚果人民只有按照毛泽东思想的指引去进行战斗。我们现在高举武装斗争的大旗，这是我国人民获得解放的唯一正确的道路。
    津巴布韦一位自由战士说：“我们斗争的经验已经证明了某些人的一些陈词滥调的破产，他们胡说什么可以通过和平道路来取得解放。我们已经认识到，我们获得解放的唯一途径是用枪杆子来反对枪杆子。”
    正在为反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略而坚强战斗的一位巴勒斯坦革命战士坚信，“枪杆子里面出政权”是颠扑不破的真理。他说，“我们已经选择了武装斗争作为解放我们祖国的唯一道路”。
    委内瑞拉一位青年说：我们接受了中国人民的革命经验和毛泽东同志的教导，有成千上万的青年走进山区，拿起武器，同帝国主义和反动派进行搏斗。毛主席的书已深深印在我们的头脑中。
    玻利维亚共产党机关报《解放报》指出，现代修正主义者吹嘘的所谓夺取政权的“和平道路”已经彻底破产。“各国人民通过切身体验懂得，他们取得胜利的唯一保证，是坚决拿起革命的枪杆子来。”
    毛主席关于农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的光辉思想，是对马克思列宁主义的天才发展。全世界越来越多的革命者努力学习和在斗争中运用毛主席关于建立农村革命根据地，用乡村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权的光辉思想。他们信心百倍地说：“井冈山的道路，是革命胜利的必经之路。”
    苏丹一位朋友在一首充满革命激情的颂诗中写道：
    “伟大的导师啊！
    您的思想已把所有的革命人民武装。
    我们将高举红旗紧紧跟着您，
    打倒美帝狗豺狼。
    我们要走农村包围城市的道路，
    用大刀长矛把敌人消灭光。”
    一位印度尼西亚朋友强调指出：印尼人民要推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，除了遵循毛泽东同志所指出的道路以外，别的道路是没有的。为了建立人民民主政权，我们必须进行人民战争，在农村建立革命根据地，实行持久战，依靠农民群众，进行土地革命，在斗争中贯彻自力更生原则，团结一切可以团结的力量，包围城市并夺取最后胜利。我们必须坚决丢掉和彻底消除一切幻想和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者所贩卖的关于“和平道路”、“依靠资产阶级”等一切错误思想和其他修正主义“理论”。我们必须实现毛泽东同志对我们的教导：“用革命战争反对反革命战争”。
    安哥拉一位游击战士指出，中国通过动员农民，从农村的根据地开始革命。我们认为，中国的道路完全正确，它很适合于我们。
    哥伦比亚一位农民运动负责人说：“农民在中国的革命中起了很大作用。我们国家也是一样，农民占大多数。反动军队离不开城市，他们一到农村，就处处被动，处处挨游击队的打。毛主席的农村包围城市并最后夺取城市的思想，非常正确，非常伟大。”
    巴西一位朋友热情洋溢地说：“为了寻找一条巴西解放的道路，我找了几十年。今天，我在中国找到了，这就是井冈山的道路！”
    多米尼加一位朋友强调指出：“没有当年的井冈山，就没有中国革命的胜利，没有中国革命的胜利，就没有多米尼加革命的胜利，就没有世界革命的胜利。井冈山的道路，是革命胜利的必经之路。”
    人民战争理论是世界  革命人民最强大的武器
    毛主席的人民战争理论，是对世界各被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争的伟大贡献。毛主席的人民战争理论正在武装越来越多的革命人民，鼓舞他们信心百倍地去战胜敌人。
    英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中越战越强，取得了伟大胜利。因此，他们对毛泽东思想分外感到亲切。越南南方一位战斗英雄说：“毛主席的军事思想，是无产阶级和被压迫民族争取解放的最正确的理论。毛主席的人民战争思想，是世界革命人民战胜敌人的法宝。”
    正在英勇地同最凶恶的美国狼较量的老挝人民称赞毛主席的人民战争思想，是“最伟大、最卓越的创作之一”，它“对被压迫民族的解放运动作出了非常伟大的贡献”。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军的一位指挥员指出：“阿尔巴尼亚人民军很重视掌握毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想。这一思想对于阿尔巴尼亚军事建设具有指导意义。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党根据人民战争的思想，实行全民武装，加强战备。因此，我们国家虽小，并且处在帝国主义和修正主义的包围和封锁之中，但我们坚信，我们是不可战胜的。”
    刚果（金）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》在今年一月份刊登的一篇文章中强调指出，在总结了三年斗争的经验教训之后，我们认为，正确的路线是根据我国的形势和具体条件，去执行毛泽东同志关于人民战争的伟大教导。
    英国的一位工人高兴地说：“毛泽东使我们懂得了决定战争胜负的因素是人，而不是武器。它打破了资本主义制度过去给我们灌输的迷信物质和技术的旧观念。它也使我们对自己的斗争充满了信心。”
    阿根廷共产主义先锋组织政治书记埃利亚斯·塞曼着重指出：“毛泽东同志总结了每一个时期中国革命的经验，提出了人民战争的规律，这些规律今天成了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民革命行动的指南。”
    正如一位身经百战的南越解放军团长所说，解放军运用毛主席的军事思想和战术原则，打近战，打夜战，集中力量打歼灭战，战胜了现代化装备的美国侵略军。这证明毛主席的伟大军事思想是战无不胜的。
    今天，在越南、老挝、缅甸、泰国、印度、马来亚（包括新加坡）和菲律宾，亿万人民正在战争中学习和运用毛主席的军事学说。在非洲，武装斗争的火焰正在刚果（金）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚等中部和南部非洲地区燃烧。革命战士们把毛主席的军事著作看成是“黑夜里的指路明灯”。刚果（金）的战士们说，任何东西都可以丢，就是万万不能丢失毛主席著作。在一向被美帝国主义当作“后院”的拉丁美洲，许多国家的革命者也都纷纷拿起武器，带着毛主席的著作，进入高山密林，进行斗争。在毛主席光辉的军事理论指引下，世界革命人民武装斗争的熊熊烈火一定会越烧越旺，最终把帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派统统埋葬！
