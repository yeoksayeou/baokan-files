On August 21, two U.S. imperialist A-6 attack aircraft launched from a U.S. aircraft carrier were completely annihilated by our heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. This type of aircraft is a new model of the U.S. imperialist navy, piloted by two American air bandits. Its maximum speed is 1,158 kilometers per hour, with a maximum flight altitude of 9,150 meters. It can stay in the air for over five hours and is equipped with 2 to 4 "Small Bull" or "Magpie" air-to-ground missiles, bombs, and combined attack devices.

No matter how fast or high the U.S. imperialist aggressor aircraft fly, as long as they dare to intrude into our sacred airspace, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will, following the orders of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely and thoroughly annihilate them.

    被我击落的美国A—6型攻击机
    八月二十一日被我英雄的中国人民解放军空军某部一举全歼的两架美帝国主义A—6型攻击机，是从美国航空母舰上起飞的美帝国主义海军新式飞机。这种飞机由两名美国飞贼驾驶，最大时速一千一百五十八公里，最大飞行高度九千一百五十米，空中飞行时间可达五个多小时，携带二至四枚“小斗犬”或“百舌鸟”空地导弹和炸弹以及联合攻击装置等。
    不管美帝国主义强盗飞机，飞得多快，爬得多高，只要它们胆敢侵入我神圣领空，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，都将遵照伟大领袖毛主席的命令，坚决把它们彻底干净全部消灭掉。
