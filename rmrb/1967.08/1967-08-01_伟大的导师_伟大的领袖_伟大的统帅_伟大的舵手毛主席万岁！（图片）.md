The great commander Chairman Mao warmly waves to us, adding boundless strength to our resolve. All the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and the broad revolutionary masses, must take Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution as exemplified by Lu Xun's "beat the fallen dogs," and thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, making them infamous for eternity and ensuring they never rise again.

The great People's Liberation Army of China is truly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao. This matchless people's army is the firm backing and reliable support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. With such a strong backing, the proletarian revolutionaries will surely be invincible.

    伟大的导师  伟大的领袖  伟大的统帅  伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
    伟大统帅毛主席向我们亲切招手，给我们增添了无限的力量。我们人民解放军的全体指战员、广大革命群众一定要把毛泽东思想作为最锐利的武器，发扬鲁迅“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透、批倒、批臭，叫他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。

    伟大的中国人民解放军，不愧为忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的举世无双的人民军队。无产阶级革命派有了这样坚强的后盾，坚强的靠山，就一定能无往而不胜。
