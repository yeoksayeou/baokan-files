**Editor's Note:** Under the guise of "ancient for modern use," using the ghosts of history to create public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration, this is an important aspect and method of a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists conducting anti-party activities under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. China's Khrushchev is doing just that. Over the past seventeen years, he, along with Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, Qi Yanming, Tian Han, and Zhang Gang, has colluded with the reactionary bourgeois forces in the opera world, using every means to resist Chairman Mao's instructions on opera reform. They fervently advocate for feudal and capitalist old operas, ruthlessly suppress revolutionary modern operas, and turn the opera stage into a platform for restoring capitalism. The former secretary and deputy director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute and editor of the "Drama Newspaper," Zhang Gang, is China's Khrushchev's agent in the opera world and the vanguard of using old operas to conduct counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

Zhang Gang is an old hand at conducting counter-revolutionary activities. As early as the 1930s, he followed Zhou Yang, promoting the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming, using the banner of "defense drama" to recklessly attack Lu Xun and the proletarian slogan of "national revolutionary war literature" proposed by Lu Xun.

During the Anti-Japanese War, he usurped the position of director of the Drama Department of the Lu Xun Arts Academy in Yan'an and, in collusion with Zhou Yang, continued to conduct counter-revolutionary activities through drama, strongly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

After liberation, he formed a close-knit group with Zhou Yang and, under the instructions of China's Khrushchev, used the opera stage to frenziedly oppose the party and socialism. He viciously attacked Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, advocating the revisionist theories of "people's literature" and "complete inheritance," providing theoretical grounds for emperors, generals, talents, and beauties to continue occupying the stage. During the three years of temporary difficulties, he collaborated with the domestic and foreign class enemies' attacks, vigorously promoting counter-revolutionary historical dramas of "using the past to criticize the present." When the great revolution of Peking Opera was in full swing, he fiercely attacked, obstructed, and sabotaged it, becoming the vanguard of suppressing the Peking Opera revolution.

Now, the emperors, generals, talents, and beauties that have been occupying the opera stage have been driven away, and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backers, China's Khrushchev, who use old operas to conduct activities to restore capitalism, have also been exposed one by one. History is ruthless. Anyone who tries to block the progress of history will be buried by the revolutionary tide.

Chairman Mao teaches us that proletarian dictatorship is "a protective amulet and a family heirloom for the victorious people, until the imperialists abroad and the classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated, this amulet must not be discarded." The party's policy on opera reform, the party's criticism and struggle against reactionary operas, and the necessary administrative measures taken are all specific manifestations of proletarian dictatorship in the cultural realm. To oppose this is to oppose proletarian dictatorship.

China's Khrushchev and his agent in the opera world, Zhang Gang, in order to achieve the goal of allowing old operas to freely spread and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, first directed their attacks at opera reform. China's Khrushchev personally took the lead, fanning the flames and lighting the fires, opening the green light for the emergence of ghosts and snakes in the opera world. He advocated that "even monks and nuns are not forbidden, so why forbid operas?" "Old operas have educational significance and should not be changed," "they cannot be changed at will," openly abolishing proletarian dictatorship.

The master gives the order, and the servant follows. Zhang Gang also took off his shirt and joined the fray, viciously attacking the party's opera reform policy as "destroying culture." He openly raised the black flag of "abolishing opera reform," shouting, "'Opera reform' has no specific content." If it continues to be "reformed," "opera will collapse in our hands, and our descendants will curse us!" At that time, the socialist transformation of opera had just begun. In this situation, Zhang Gang impatiently jumped out to oppose opera reform, aiming to allow feudal and capitalist old operas to freely spread unchanged, using them to undermine the newly established socialist economic foundation.

Zhang Gang also absurdly claimed that banning the performance of bad operas is the "root of rules and taboos," advocating to "break the rules and taboos" and "let it go, let it go, let it go!" He vigorously advocated bourgeois liberalization. At the same time, he spread hatred towards the socialist system. He maliciously said, "opera, under long-term feudal rule, in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era, and even under the rule of Japanese imperialists, could 'revive, grow, and flourish,' but today, why is it that people are so worried and anxious that it might not survive or last long?" Zhang Gang attempted to use this reactionary clamor to incite people to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, which is a pipe dream! For reactionary operas that serve imperialism and feudalism, we not only do not allow them to "revive and flourish," but we must completely overthrow them!

After the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, Zhang Gang misjudged the situation and became even more brazen in inciting the counter-revolutionary forces in the opera world to cause trouble. At that time, our beloved leader Chairman Mao sharply pointed out, "After the Hungarian incident, some people in our country felt happy. They hoped that a similar event would occur in China." Zhang Gang was one of them. He shouted, "chaos!" He called on people to "take sticks" to "disrupt the world," to "dredge up" the capitalist and feudal cultural dregs that had "sunk to the bottom of the sea." However, Zhang Gang and his ilk were too optimistic. Under the leadership of the party, a vigorous anti-rightist struggle was launched, and Zhang Gang and his ilk's hope to reenact the Hungarian incident in China was dashed! Due to the protection of China's Khrushchev's agent in the literary world, Zhou Yang and his gang, this big rightist, Zhang Gang, slipped through the net.

But Zhang Gang did not give up. He continued to fiercely attack proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao criticized ghost operas. Under the guidance of comrades such as Jiang Qing, revolutionary comrades in Shanghai published an article criticizing the anti-party poisonous weed ghost opera "Li Huiniang." Zhang Gang hated this to the core. He cursed, "It's not good to be all leftist, it will mess things up." He also slandered our criticism and struggle against anti-party poisonous weeds as "political oppression." However, at the same time Zhang Gang was attacking us for "political oppression," he himself was carrying out the most barbaric political oppression against the proletariat. After the revolutionary leading cadres in Shanghai proposed the slogan of "writing thirteen years," Zhang Gang, together with the old anti-party hand Zhou Yang, launched an attack; after Shanghai held a drama festival with the content of "writing thirteen years," Zhang Gang, who usurped the position of editor of the "Drama Newspaper," ordered the editorial department to "stay calm" and "not publish an editorial," attempting to block and belittle its revolutionary influence; after the revolutionary leading cadres in Shanghai delivered a report holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Zhang Gang dismissed it as "one person's opinion" and "can ignore it," suppressing it for a long time. Isn't this bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat, the most barbaric political oppression! We must warn Zhang Gang: for you and this small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must implement proletarian dictatorship. Only in this way can the cause of socialism be victorious!

While opposing proletarian dictatorship, Zhang Gang also, according to China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "'innovation' cannot be forced" and "promoting feudalism is not afraid," arbitrarily distorted Chairman Mao's policy of "pushing the old to make way for the new."

Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago: to let the true masters of history occupy the opera stage and take away the power of the masters, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. Zhang Gang, however, sang the opposite tune. Old operas clearly treated the people as dregs, but he said they reflected the "will and wishes" of the people; clearly, the masters, ladies, young masters, and young ladies ruled the old opera stage, but he said they were "created for the people," and he did not allow "them to be sentenced." This is pure counter-revolutionary logic, a replica of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious, rebellion is unreasonable."

Zhang Gang also advocated: old operas are "like a pearl buried in the soil," just "sweep away the dust," and they can "emit the light of socialist art," and can "justifiably be included in the ranks of socialist new culture." This is an intolerable distortion of the policy of "pushing the old to make way for the new." Chairman Mao's "pushing the old to make way for the new" is to use the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to push away the old feudalism and capitalism, and bring forth the new socialism. While Zhang Gang's "sweeping away the dust" is to slightly touch up the feudal and capitalist junk, passing it off as a socialist artistic pearl. Zhang Gang wanted to use the magician's trick to put a "socialist" beautiful coat on the feudal corpse, making it come back to life and clear the way for the restoration of capitalism.

In his epoch-making brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao proposed six political criteria for distinguishing between flowers and weeds. This exposed all the ghosts and snakes disguised as "socialism." Zhang Gang was extremely hostile to this. In his article "The Struggle Between Flowers and Weeds in Opera," he raved, "The dogmatic division of flowers and weeds is subjective and impractical," "harming the development of opera," "since it was wrong in the past, can we not redefine a few correct ones?" Zhang Gang opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian political criteria in order to promote bourgeois political criteria.

The bourgeois political criteria that Zhang Gang always waved around were "people's nature." In fact, this was just a broken weapon used by the bourgeoisie. Using concepts like "people" and "nation" to blur the differences between classes is a common trick of the bourgeoisie. Zhang Gang picked up this broken item, using it as a label to stick everywhere, thus turning all weeds into "flowers." Look:

Clearly, operas that maintain the interests of the feudal ruling class, such as the Bao Gong operas, Zhang Gang said they were "good operas with people's nature."

Clearly, operas that use a group of vengeful ghosts to promote feudal superstition and fatalism, such as "Red Plum Pavilion," Zhang Gang said they were "beautiful ghosts," "very lovable ghosts," "ghosts with people's nature," "educational for the people," and "excellent plays."

Clearly, operas that promote feudal morality, such as "Reed Flower Record," Zhang Gang said "loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness also have people's nature."

Clearly, poisonous weeds that glorify traitors, such as "Four Generals Visit Their Mother," Zhang Gang said he saw it in Yan'an and "cried, thinking of leaving home and family, unable to reunite."

Enough, enough, Zhang Gang's so-called "people's nature" is thoroughly landlord and bourgeois nature! Zhang Gang's claim that old operas have "rich people's nature" is actually that they have rich counter-revolutionary nature of the landlord and bourgeoisie. He wanted to use these "rich" feudal and capitalist goods to serve the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and the bourgeoisie.

To create public opinion for the conspiracy of the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who want to take the capitalist road to seize the party, seize power, and seize the military, Zhang Gang also, through the method of "reinterpreting" old operas, directly attacked the party, attacked the socialist system, attacked Chairman Mao, and promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Zhang Gang "interpreted" a piece of black speech from "Striking the Golden Branch": "People do not want to fight unless they have no choice. Because people want peace, not destruction. Revolution and uprising are not always people's nature." He vigorously advocated "peaceful coexistence" and opposed revolutionary war.

Before the Lushan Conference, Zhang Gang also found a counter-revolutionary incantation from the "reinterpretation" of "The Orphan of Zhao." In "Idle Talk Under the Stage," he hinted at attacking our party's leadership, inciting the rich, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and bourgeoisie to oppose the party and socialism. Zhang Gang also praised those who conspired to seize the party, seize power, and seize the military as "the sun in summer," wanting them to use "upright and fierce spirit" to "face-to-face admonition," opposing our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao. What "idle talk" is this? It is clearly counter-revolutionary barking!

Zhang Gang felt that using "reinterpretation" to oppose the party was not enough. Therefore, after his counter-revolutionary comrades Wu Han, Tian Han, Zhou Xinfang, and others concocted a batch of anti-party and anti-socialist so-called "historical dramas," Zhang Gang immediately "established the theory" for them and enthusiastically advocated writing anti-party historical dramas. He advocated writing historical dramas to "use the mouths of historical figures to express dissatisfaction with reality." He feared that people might not understand the counter-revolutionary intentions of the big poisonous weeds such as "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Hai Rui's Memorial," and "Xie Yaohuan," so he repeatedly reminded, "There are no historical dramas written without purpose," urging people to understand the author's "hidden meaning" and reach a "tacit understanding" with the author's "emotions." He did not hide the fact that those anti-party historical dramas were "imperial textbooks." It can be seen that he advocated historical dramas, aiming directly at the party central committee.

The anti-party conspirators Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi also advocated writing the "spirit of Wei Zheng." Zhang Gang also jumped out, shouting to write the spirit of "bravely admonishing the emperor" by Wei Zheng. Their "spirit of Wei Zheng" is the same black goods as the "spirit of Hai Rui" advocated by the old anti-communist Wu Han, both are their own counter-revolutionary spirit. Zhang Gang advocated "accepting admonition," which is to "accept" the admonition of this group to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line! Zhang Gang also said, "If the emperor can accept a minister like Wei Zheng who 'bravely admonishes the emperor,' it is truly fortunate for the world." Whose "fortunate for the world"? If your conspiracy succeeds, our country will change color, and millions of revolutionary people will be drowned in blood.

Zhang Gang also recommended to people to write about Zheng Chenggong "after defeating the Dutch colonialists," not just "driving away the colonialists," but inviting the colonialists back to "sign a treaty" and "do business," making the colonialists very happy and writing a "letter of thanks." Zhang Gang said, writing like this "can move the emotions of many audiences." Why would "doing business" with colonialists move people? He once said in a meeting, "Zheng Chenggong is a great figure who can handle the united front." One word revealed the secret. It turned out that Zhang Gang wanted us to open the door to colonialists, form a "united front" with colonialists, and surrender to colonialists! When Zhang Gang said these black words, it was precisely when our party, under the personal leadership of the great teacher Chairman Mao, was conducting a comprehensive and open criticism of the Khrushchev revisionist clique. Zhang Gang was so afraid and so angry that he could no longer contain his "excitement," fervently advocating the use of historical ghosts and the method of "using the past to criticize the present" to serve China's Khrushchev to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three harmonies and one less," attempting to suppress and eliminate the revolutionary movements of the oppressed peoples and nations around the world. Zhang Gang's words exposed the wolfish ambition of this counter-revolutionary revisionist!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have exposed China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary accomplices. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating fallen dogs, and thoroughly criticize and struggle against them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrowing and exposing them!

    张庚是利用旧戏曲复辟资本主义的急先锋
    中国戏曲研究院全体革命同志
    编者按：打着“古为今用”的幌子，借助于历史的亡灵，为实现反革命复辟制造舆论，这是无产阶级专政条件下，一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行反党活动的一个重要方面，一个重要方法。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫正是这样做的。十七年来，他伙同彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、田汉、张庚之流，勾结戏曲界的资产阶级反动势力，千方百计抗拒毛主席关于戏曲改革的指示，狂热地鼓吹封建主义、资本主义的旧戏曲，拚命扼杀革命的现代戏，把戏曲舞台变成了复辟资本主义的舆论阵地。原中国戏曲研究院党委书记兼副院长、《戏剧报》主编张庚，就是中国赫鲁晓夫在戏曲界的代理人，就是中国赫鲁晓夫利用旧戏曲进行反革命复辟活动的急先锋。
    张庚是一个长期从事反革命活动的老手。
    早在三十年代，他就追随周扬，推行王明的右倾机会主义路线，打着“国防戏剧”的旗号，肆无忌惮地攻击鲁迅，攻击鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的口号。
    抗日战争期间，他窃踞了延安鲁艺戏剧系主任的职位，又与周扬串通一气，利用戏剧继续从事反革命活动，极力反对毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    解放以后，他与周扬一伙结成死党，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，利用戏曲阵地猖狂地反党反社会主义。他恶毒地攻击毛主席的革命文艺路线，大肆鼓吹修正主义的“全民文艺”论、“全盘继承”论，为帝王将相、才子佳人继续霸占舞台制造理论根据。在三年暂时困难时期，他配合国内外的阶级敌人的进攻，竭力提倡“借古讽今”的反革命历史剧。当伟大的京剧革命轰轰烈烈地兴起的时候，他又拚命攻击，极力阻挠，大肆破坏，充当了扼杀京剧革命运动的急先锋。
    现在，盘踞在戏曲舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人已经被赶了下去，利用旧戏曲进行复辟资本主义活动的一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的后台中国的赫鲁晓夫，也一个一个地被揪了出来。历史是无情的。凡是企图阻挡历史前进的，必将被革命的潮流所埋葬。
  　毛主席教导我们，无产阶级专政“对于胜利了的人民”，“是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”党的戏曲改革政策，党对于反动戏曲的批判、斗争以及所采取的必要的行政措施，都是无产阶级专政在文化领域里的具体体现。反对这一点，就是反对无产阶级专政。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在戏曲界的代理人张庚，为了要达到让旧戏曲自由泛滥、为资本主义复辟制造舆论的目的，首先把攻击的矛头指向戏曲改革。中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，煽阴风、点鬼火，为戏曲界牛鬼蛇神的出笼大开绿灯。他宣扬什么“和尚尼姑都不禁了，还禁戏？”“老戏很有教育意义，不要去改”，“不能乱改”，公开取消无产阶级专政。
    主子下令，奴才紧跟。张庚也赤膊上阵，恶毒地攻击党的戏改政策是“毁灭文化”。他公然打出“取消戏改”的黑旗，叫嚷：“‘戏改’已经没有了具体内容。”再“改”下去，“戏曲在我们手里垮了，子孙要骂的！”当时，戏曲的社会主义改造还刚刚开始。在这种情况下，张庚迫不及待地跳出来反对戏改，其目的，就是要让封建主义、资本主义的旧戏曲原封不动地自由泛滥，用来瓦解新建立的社会主义经济基础。
    张庚还胡说什么禁演坏戏是“清规戒律的根子”，并鼓吹“打破清规戒律”，来一个“放，放，放”！大肆鼓吹资产阶级自由化。同时，他还竭力散布对社会主义制度的仇恨情绪。他刻毒地说：“戏曲在长期的封建统治下，在半殖民地半封建的时代里，甚至在日本帝国主义者统治之下”，都能“活过来，成长茁壮起来”，“今天怎么倒反而使人担心不已，忧心如焚地怕它活不了，活不长呢？”张庚妄图用这种反动叫嚣煽动人们起来推翻无产阶级专政，这是白日作梦！对于替帝国主义和封建主义服务的反动戏曲，我们不仅不允许它们“活过来，成长茁壮起来”，而且要把它们彻底打倒！
    在匈牙利反革命叛乱事件出现以后，张庚错误地估计了形势，更加明目张胆地煽动戏曲界的反革命势力起来捣乱。当时，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席曾尖锐地指出：“匈牙利事件发生以后，我国有些人感到高兴。他们希望在中国也出现一个那样的事件”。张庚就是其中的一个。他狂叫：要“乱”！他号召人们“拿棍子”来“扰乱世界”，把已经“沉到海底”的资本主义、封建主义文化渣滓，重新“打捞起来”。但是，张庚之流“乐观”得太早了。在党的领导下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，张庚之流要在中国重演匈牙利事件的希望落空了！由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的代理人周扬一伙的庇护，张庚这个大右派才漏了网。
    但张庚贼心不死，继续疯狂地攻击无产阶级专政。毛主席批评了鬼戏。在江青等同志的指导下，上海革命派同志发表了批判反党大毒草鬼戏《李慧娘》的文章。对此，张庚恨之入骨，他破口大骂：“光左也不行，会搞坏事情的。”他还诬蔑我们对反党大毒草的批判斗争是搞“政治压迫”。可是，就在张庚攻击我们搞
  “政治压迫”的同一时期内，张庚自己正在对无产阶级实行最蛮横的政治压迫。上海的革命领导干部提出了“写十三年”的口号以后，张庚就伙同反党老手周扬一起进行围攻；上海召开了以“写十三年”为内容的华东话剧观摩演出大会以后，窃踞《戏剧报》主编职位的张庚就下令编辑部“要沉住气”，“不发社论”，妄图封锁和贬低它的革命影响；上海的革命领导干部发表了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的报告以后，张庚就贬之为“一家言”、“可以不理它”，加以长期扣压。这一切，难道不是资产阶级对无产阶级实行专政，实行最蛮横的政治压迫吗！我们要正告张庚：对于你们这一小撮反革命修正主义分子，我们必须实行无产阶级专政。只有这样，社会主义事业才能胜利！
    张庚在反对无产阶级专政的同时，还按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“‘出新’不能勉强”，“宣传封建不怕”等反动谬论，肆意篡改毛主席的“推陈出新”的方针。
    毛主席早在二十多年前就指出：要让历史的真正主人翁来占领戏曲舞台，夺老爷太太少爷小姐们的权。张庚却大唱反调。旧戏曲明明是把人民当成了渣滓，他却说反映了人民的“意志和愿望”；明明是老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着旧戏舞台，他却说是“为人民而创造”，而且还不准“给它们判罪”。这是地地道道的反革命逻辑，这是中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“造反无理”的反革命谬论的翻版。
    张庚还鼓吹：旧戏曲“就好象一颗埋在土里的珠子一样”，只要“打扫灰尘”，就能“发出社会主义艺术的光辉来”，就可以“理直气壮地被列入社会主义新文化之林”。这是对于“推陈出新”方针的令人难以容忍的歪曲。毛主席提出的“推陈出新”，是要用无产阶级的彻底革命精神，推掉封建主义、资本主义之陈，出社会主义之新。而张庚所谓的“打扫灰尘”，就是把封建主义、资本主义的破烂玩艺，稍加粉饰，冒充社会主义的艺术明珠。张庚想用魔术师的办法，在封建僵尸身上，披一件“社会主义”的美丽外衣，使它们复活起来，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    毛主席在具有划时代意义的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中，提出了鉴别香花与毒草的六条政治标准。这就使一切披着“社会主义”外衣的牛鬼蛇神大显原形。张庚对此极端仇恨。他在《戏曲上的香花毒草之争》一文中，疯狂地诋毁道：“教条地规定的香花毒草之分，是主观而不切实际的”，“遗害于戏曲的发展”，“既然过去是错了，可不可以重新规定几条正确的呢？”张庚反对毛主席提出的无产阶级政治标准，是为了要推行资产阶级政治标准。
    张庚手里一贯挥舞的资产阶级政治标准，就是“人民性”。其实，这不过是早已为资产阶级用过的破烂武器。用“人民”“国民”之类的概念来抹煞各个阶级之间的差别，是资产阶级惯用的手法。张庚却把这个破烂货色捡来，用它作为标签到处一贴，于是所有的毒草统统变成了“香花”。请看：
    明明是为维护封建统治阶级利益的坏戏，如包公戏，张庚却说是“有人民性”的“好戏”。
    明明是用一群冤魂厉鬼，宣扬封建迷信和宿命论的鬼戏，如《红梅阁》等，张庚却说这是“美丽的鬼”、“非常可爱的鬼”、“有人民性的鬼”，“对人民是有教育意义的”“优秀剧目”。
    明明是宣扬封建道德的坏戏，如《芦花记》等，张庚却说“忠孝节义也有人民性”。
    明明是美化叛徒的毒草，如《四郎探母》，张庚却说他在延安看了，就“流了眼泪，想起了离乡背井，一家不能团聚”！
    够了，够了，张庚所谓的“人民性”，就是彻头彻尾的地主资产阶级性！张庚所说的旧戏曲“有丰富的人民性”，实际就是有丰富的地主资产阶级的反革命性。他要用这种“丰富”的封建主义、资本主义的货色，来为地富反坏右和资产阶级服务。
    为了替党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡政、篡军的阴谋制造舆论，张庚还通过对旧戏曲“重新解释”的方式，直接攻击党，攻击社会主义制度，攻击毛主席，推行反革命修正主义路线。
    苏共二十大后，张庚从《打金枝》中“解释”出一段黑话来：“人民不到万不得已，是不愿打仗的。因为人民要求的是和平生活，而不是打烂。总是革命、起义，并不都是人民性。”竭力宣扬“和平共处”，反对革命战争。
    庐山会议前夕，张庚又从《赵氏孤儿》的“重新解释”中，找到了配合国内外敌人大反三面红旗的反革命咒语。他在《台下闲谈》中，含沙射影地攻击我们党的领导，鼓动地、富、反、坏、右起来反党反社会主义。张庚还把那些篡党、篡政、篡军的反党阴谋家吹捧为“夏日之日”，要他们用“刚直凌厉之气”来进行“面谏”，反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。这是什么“闲谈”？分明是反革命的狂吠！
    张庚觉得，光是用“重新解释”进行反党，还很不满足。所以，当他的反革命同伙吴晗、田汉、周信芳等炮制了一批反党反社会主义的所谓“历史剧”以后，张庚就立即为他们“立论”，并起劲地鼓吹创作反党历史剧。他鼓吹写历史剧就是要“借历史人物的口，发出对现实的不满”。他唯恐人们不懂得《海瑞罢官》《海瑞上疏》《谢瑶环》等大毒草的反革命意图，所以一再提醒：“无所为而写历史剧的人恐怕是没有的”，要人们懂得作者的“曲笔”，同“作者之心情”达成“默契”。他毫不隐讳地称那些反党历史剧是“皇帝教科书”。可见他提倡历史剧，矛头是直指党中央的。
    反党野心家彭真、陆定一都鼓吹过写“魏征精神”，张庚也跳出来大喊要写魏征的“犯颜直谏”精神。他们的“魏征精神”，同反共老手吴晗鼓吹的“海瑞精神”完全是一路黑货，都是他们自己的反革命精神的代名词。张庚宣扬“纳谏”，就是“纳”他们这一伙推行反革命修正主义路线的“谏”！张庚还说：“皇帝能够容纳象魏征这样‘犯颜直谏’的臣子，真是天下之幸”。究竟是谁的“天下之幸”？如果你们的阴谋得逞，我们的国家就要变色，千百万革命人民将淹没在血泊之中。
    张庚还向人们推荐要写郑成功“打败了荷兰殖民者以后”，不是把殖民主义者“赶跑就算了”，而是把殖民主义者再请回来，同他们“订条约”，“做买卖”，使殖民主义者很高兴，写来了“感谢信”。张庚说，这样写“是能激动许多观众的感情的”。为什么同殖民主义者“做买卖”就能使人“激动”呢？他在一个会上就说过：“郑成功是一个了不起的人物，会搞国际统一战线。”一语泄天机。原来张庚要我们向殖民主义者开放门户，同殖民主义者搞“统一战线”，向殖民主义者投降！张庚说这些黑话的时候，正是我们党在伟大导师毛主席的亲自领导下，对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团进行全面的公开批判的时候。张庚怕得要命，恨得要死，再也按捺不住自己的“激动”，狂热鼓吹借历史的亡灵，用借古讽今的手法，来为中国赫鲁晓夫推销“三和一少”、“三降一灭”的反革命修正主义路线服务，妄图镇压和消灭全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命运动。张庚的这些话，活脱脱地暴露了这个反革命修正主义分子的狼子野心！
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万革命群众把中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命同伙们揪了出来。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭！
