The unprecedented Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has shaken the world and accelerated the development of world revolution. Revolutionary friends from various countries in Beijing enthusiastically hail the Chinese revolutionary masses for exposing China's Khrushchev, strengthening and consolidating China as the world's red base for revolution, and hail the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology for revolutionary fighters worldwide.

Over the past year, revolutionary friends from six continents working in Beijing have actively participated in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, fighting shoulder to shoulder with Chinese revolutionary masses. They deeply feel the great historical and international significance of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. Some foreign friends in Beijing recently received our reporter and unanimously pointed out that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has revealed the existence of class and class struggle in socialist society and the presence of a bourgeois headquarters within the organs of proletarian dictatorship. They said that this great revolution tells the world's genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people that the bourgeois headquarters is the main enemy under proletarian dictatorship. Completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters and seizing back the power usurped by the bourgeois representatives within the party is the key to preventing capitalist restoration and carrying the socialist revolution to the end. Foreign friends said that this practice is the great helmsman Chairman Mao's creative development and enrichment of Marxism-Leninism's theory on proletarian dictatorship, paving the way and pointing the direction for carrying the socialist revolution to the end and transitioning from socialism to communism. They enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the path of Mao Zedong Thought is the absolutely correct path; following Chairman Mao means victory.

Japanese friend Yokawa Jiro said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has made the world's revolutionary people more clearly understand that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the world's people. Further establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the international communist movement is a great victory for the world's people. Japanese revolutionaries in the future will one hundred percent hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and one hundred percent believe in Mao Zedong Thought. This is our conclusion from the struggle. Somali friend Beker, speaking about Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions on the proletarian cultural revolution, excitedly said, I affirm that Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the world's people. Italian friend Manlio Di Nucci said with deep emotion, Chairman Mao is the beacon of the world's people striving for liberation.

Various friends, when talking about the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, all enthusiastically congratulate and hail the Chinese revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, for exposing the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road. They said, Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" sounded the charge for a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. The great victory achieved in this struggle over the past year has greatly encouraged the revolutionary struggle of the world's revolutionary people and dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Japanese friend Yokawa Jiro said, this great struggle teaches us that the proletariat, which has already seized power, must eliminate the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration; the proletariat, which has not yet seized power, must also firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely fight against revisionism to the end, otherwise, it cannot seize power. He said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has made us more deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. It teaches us that after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads has not ended, and the question of who will defeat whom has not been resolved. Without launching a great proletarian revolution, we cannot overthrow the bourgeois representatives hidden within the proletarian organs, and the color of the proletarian dictatorship will change. The proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has pointed the direction for the world's proletarian revolutionary struggle and made outstanding contributions to the international communist movement.

Italian friend Di Nucci said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution creatively answers the question of how socialist countries prevent revisionism and carry the socialist revolution to the end. That is, the proletariat must seize back the power usurped by the bourgeoisie, must carry out a revolution in the ideological realm, and must continually purge the influence of bourgeois ideology in the superstructure. To accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to mobilize the masses from below.

He said, Chairman Mao best understands the laws of human history's development and dares to mobilize tens of millions of revolutionary masses to struggle for power. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, I once again recognize the correctness of Chairman Mao's proposition that "the people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." The handful of power-holders within the Chinese Communist Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by China's Khrushchev, attempted to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, but their attempts have failed. Chairman Mao leads hundreds of millions of people on the road to communism, and the reactionary forces will definitely be overthrown by the people.

Sri Lankan friend Damby said, the Chinese people are carrying out a revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev, aiming to thoroughly criticize him politically, ideologically, and theoretically. This is an important step in completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. The Chinese revolutionary criticism is to educate and arm the people with Mao Zedong Thought. Billions of revolutionary people mastering Mao Zedong Thought will make China unchangeable forever, which will have a profound international impact on promoting the development of the world proletarian revolutionary cause.

Somali friend Beker said, the Chinese proletarian revolutionary faction has seized power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. This struggle clearly tells us that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is also very sharp. Some people, although they are in the Communist Party and wear the cloak of a Communist Party member, are actually bourgeois representatives hidden within the proletarian headquarters, attempting to restore capitalism. The great wisdom of the great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out this problem to us. This once again proves that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist.

He said, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works to uncover the bourgeois representatives hidden within the proletarian ranks. We African revolutionaries stand on the side of the Chinese people and firmly support the Chinese people in severely criticizing and struggling against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, throwing them into the dustbin of history. This struggle is also a powerful support for the Somali people and the world's people.

Brazilian friend Martins said, the Chinese revolutionary masses have exposed and defeated the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party—China's Khrushchev. This battle is indispensable and is the only effective way to prevent capitalist restoration in China. He said, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, personally presided over and formulated a series of historically significant documents, systematically and perfectly proposing the theory, principles, line, policy, methods of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, making this revolution achieve such great victories. The victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has ensured the consolidation of the strategic base of world revolution—socialist China, laying a solid foundation for the transition to communism. Revolutionary people all over the world are overjoyed.

Various revolutionary fighters, in their talks, enthusiastically praised the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, which has spread the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—more widely around the world, guiding and greatly promoting the revolutionary struggles of various countries. Sri Lankan Damby said, the revolutionary faction in Sri Lanka is watching the development of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, regarding its victory as their own victory, and regarding China's Khrushchev as the negative teacher of the Sri Lankan revolutionary faction. Damby said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has made revolutionaries all over the world more deeply understand the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "The principles of Marxism are numerous, but in the final analysis, they amount to one thing: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this principle, people rebel, struggle, and carry out socialism." Revolutionaries all over the world are fighting unyieldingly according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Italian friend Di Nucci excitedly said, although the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has only been going on for a year, liberation struggles in various parts of the world have rapidly developed, and the revolutionary forces of the European proletariat have grown stronger. Millions of revolutionary red books, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," are widely circulated around the world. People of various countries have recognized that only by arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, will they definitely win.

He said, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guard movement have greatly encouraged the revolutionary forces in Italy that have already begun the anti-revisionist struggle. Italian genuine Marxist-Leninists have strengthened their study of Chairman Mao's works, broken with the Italian revisionist party, and established a new party—the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)—leading the proletariat in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionaries and modern revisionism. Di Nucci confidently said, the Italian people and people of various countries, advancing along the path opened by Comrade Mao Zedong, will definitely overthrow the reactionaries, overthrow revisionism, and win their own liberation.

Japanese Yokawa Jiro said, under the influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the Japanese left has risen up to rebel against the revisionist group led by Miyamoto. The banner they hold high is the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Japanese revolutionary people have found their own path from the experience of the Chinese revolution. The Japanese people firmly believe that the path of Mao Zedong Thought, the path of the Chinese revolution, is the path for the thorough liberation of the Japanese people.

The seas and oceans are surging with waves, and the winds and thunder are shaking the five continents. Revolutionary fighters from various countries are fighting confidently on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. They believe that under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the world revolutionary movement will definitely enter a new stage.

    在京各国革命朋友欢呼中国文化大革命推动了世界革命迅猛发展
    确立毛泽东思想绝对权威是世界人民伟大胜利
    揪出中国赫鲁晓夫巩固了世界革命红色根据地
    新华社二十八日讯  史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命震撼全球，推动了世界革命的迅猛发展。在北京的各国革命朋友热烈欢呼中国革命群众揪出中国的赫鲁晓夫，加强和巩固了中国这个世界革命的红色根据地，热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想成为全世界革命战士的指导思想。
    一年来，在北京工作的来自六大洲的各国革命朋友积极参加了中国无产阶级文化大革命，和中国革命群众一起并肩战斗，他们深深感到中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义和国际意义。在北京的一些外国朋友最近接见本社记者时一致指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命揭示了在社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争，在无产阶级专政机构内部存在着资产阶级司令部。他们说，这场伟大的革命告诉全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和世界革命人民，资产阶级司令部，是无产阶级专政下的最主要敌人，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把被资产阶级在党内的代理人篡夺了的政权重新夺回来，是防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底的关键。外国朋友说，这一实践，是世界革命的伟大舵手毛主席创造性地发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，为把社会主义革命进行到底，为从社会主义过渡到共产主义打通了航道，指明了方向。他们热烈赞颂毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想的道路，是绝对正确的道路；跟着毛主席，就是胜利。
    在北京的日本朋友横川次郎说，中国无产阶级文化大革命使世界革命人民更加清楚地认识到，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳。在国际共产主义运动中进一步确立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是世界人民的伟大胜利。日本真正的革命者今后要百分之百地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百分之百地信仰毛泽东思想，这是我们在斗争中得出的结论。来自非洲的索马里朋友贝克尔谈到毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的一系列英明决策时激动地说，我确认毛主席是世界人民最伟大的领袖。意大利朋友曼利奥·迪努齐满怀深情地说，毛主席是世界人民争取解放的灯塔。
    各国朋友在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利时，都热烈祝贺和欢呼中国革命群众在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，揪出中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的巨大胜利。他们说，毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，吹响了向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部进行全面进攻的号角，一年来这一斗争取得的伟大胜利，大大鼓舞了全世界革命人民的革命斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    日本朋友横川次郎说，这场伟大的斗争教育我们，已经掌握政权的无产阶级，要巩固无产阶级专政，必须清除混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代理人，防止资本主义复辟；没有掌握政权的无产阶级，也应该牢记毛主席的教导，坚决同修正主义斗争到底，否则就不能夺取政权。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命使我们更深刻地领会了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，它教育我们：在生产资料所有制实行社会主义改造以后，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争并没有结束，谁战胜谁的问题并没有解决。对于隐藏在无产阶级机构内的资产阶级代理人，不发动一场无产阶级群众性的大革命，就不能把他们打倒，无产阶级专政的政权也要改变颜色。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，给全世界无产阶级革命斗争指明了方向，为国际共产主义运动作出了卓越的贡献。
    意大利朋友迪努齐说，中国无产阶级文化大革命创造性地回答了社会主义国家怎样防止修正主义，怎样把社会主义革命进行到底的问题。这就是，无产阶级必须夺回被资产阶级篡夺了的政权，必须进行意识形态领域里的革命，必须不断肃清上层建筑中的资产阶级思想的影响。为了完成这些任务，就必须自下而上地发动群众。
    他说，毛主席最了解人类历史发展的规律，最敢于发动千千万万革命群众进行夺权斗争。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，我再一次认识到毛主席关于“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”这个论断的英明正确。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，企图把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，但是，他们的一切企图失败了。毛主席领导亿万人民走向共产主义道路，反动力量一定要被人民推翻。
    锡兰朋友达姆比说，中国人民正在对中国赫鲁晓夫展开革命大批判，要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他批深批透。这是彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的一个重要步骤。中国的革命大批判是用毛泽东思想教育人民，武装人民，亿万革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就会使中国永远不变颜色，这对推动世界无产阶级革命事业的发展将有深远的国际影响。
    索马里朋友贝克尔说，中国无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。这场斗争清楚地告诉我们，在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级和无产阶级的斗争也是非常尖锐的。有些人虽然身在共产党内，披着共产党员的外衣，而实际上他们却是隐藏在无产阶级司令部中的资产阶级代表人物，他们力图复辟资本主义。伟大领袖毛主席的天才和智慧向我们指明了这个问题。这再次说明毛主席是最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    他说，我们只有活学活用毛主席著作，才能识破隐藏在无产阶级队伍中的资产阶级代理人。我们非洲革命者站在中国人民一边，坚决支持中国人民狠狠批斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们丢进历史的垃圾箱。这场斗争也是对索马里人民和世界人民的有力支援。
    巴西朋友马尔丁斯说，中国革命群众揪出并击败钻进党内的资产阶级代理人——中国的赫鲁晓夫，这场战斗是不可缺少的，这是使中国避免资本主义复辟的唯一有效办法。他说，毛主席亲自发动和领导中国无产阶级文化大革命，毛主席亲自主持和制定了一系列具有历史意义的文件，系统地、完善地提出了在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、原则、路线、方针、方法，使这场革命取得了如此伟大的胜利。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，保证了世界革命的战略基地——社会主义中国的巩固，为向共产主义过渡奠定了坚实的基础。全世界革命人民都对此感到欢欣鼓舞。
    各国革命战士在谈话中热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命，使当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，在全世界得到更广泛的传播，指导和大大推动了各国的革命斗争。锡兰达姆比说，锡兰的革命派注视着中国的无产阶级文化大革命的发展，把它的胜利看成是自己的胜利，把中国赫鲁晓夫看成是锡兰革命派的反面教员。达姆比说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，使全世界革命者更加深刻地领会到毛主席指出的真理：“马克思主义的道理，千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”全世界的革命者正按照毛主席的指示进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    意大利朋友迪努齐兴奋地说，中国无产阶级文化大革命虽然只进行了一年，世界各地的解放斗争迅速发展了，欧洲的无产阶级革命派力量壮大起来了，千万本革命红书《毛主席语录》，在全世界广为流传。各国人民认识到，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，就一定会胜利。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动，大大鼓舞了在意大利已经开始进行的反修斗争的革命力量。意大利真正的马克思列宁主义者加强学习毛泽东主席著作，同意大利修正主义的党决裂，成立了新党——意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义），领导无产阶级进行反对资产阶级反动派和现代修正主义的斗争。迪努齐充满信心地说，意大利人民和各国人民沿着毛泽东同志开辟的道路前进，一定会打倒反动派，打倒修正主义，赢得自己的解放。
    日本横川次郎说，在中国无产阶级文化大革命影响下，日本左派起来造了宫本修正主义集团的反，他们高举的旗帜是伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜。日本革命人民从中国革命的经验中找到了自己的道路。日本人民坚信，毛泽东思想的道路，中国革命的道路，是日本人民彻底解放的道路。
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。各国革命战士满怀信心地战斗在反帝、反修和反对各国反动派的斗争前线，他们表示深信，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，世界革命运动必将进入一个崭新阶段。
