The two documentary films, "Chairman Mao Will Always Be in Our Hearts" and "A Brilliant Example and a Great Initiative," are being shown in the capital and will soon be shown nationwide. These films are a great concern, a great inspiration, a great support, and a great urging from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses!

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of China and the world. He has a far-reaching vision and deeply understands and summarizes the experiences and lessons of the revolutions in China and other countries. With the greatest ambition and the most resolute determination, he initiated and led, for the first time in human history, a great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world. From August 18, 1966, to November 26, 1966, in just over three months, Chairman Mao inspected and reviewed the cultural revolutionary army eight times, totaling more than 11 million people. This is an unprecedented great revolutionary initiative in the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement. The two films, "Chairman Mao Will Always Be in Our Hearts" and "A Brilliant Example and a Great Initiative," are just like the documentary films of Chairman Mao's first six inspections of the cultural revolutionary army, recording the magnificent epic of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Mao Zedong's great revolutionary initiative.

One year ago today, August 18, was a day that attracted worldwide attention. Under the call to arms of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end," the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses who launched a great offensive against the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Khrushchev of China gathered on Tiananmen Square to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao stood on Tiananmen, looking over all of China, and highly praised the burgeoning proletarian cultural revolution, pointing out: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country." For the Red Guards who had just been born and were still subjected to various criticisms and suppressions by a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and old habitual forces, Chairman Mao firmly declared: "I firmly support you!"

However, the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Khrushchev of China and their agents, like all reactionary classes, were unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history. After Chairman Mao's first inspection of the cultural revolutionary army, they continued to fiercely resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, using their influence in politics, ideology, and theory, as well as the power they still held, to adopt various vile means to continue to deceive and incite the masses who did not understand the truth, to suppress and attack the proletarian revolutionary masses, in an attempt to sabotage and strangle the thriving proletarian cultural revolution. At this critical juncture in the struggle between the two lines, the proletarian revolutionary masses, looking at Chairman Mao's quotations and longing for Tiananmen, missed the great leader Chairman Mao even more; Chairman Mao, who always shared the same breath and fate with the revolutionary masses, understood the situation and feelings of the revolutionary masses the best, and inspected the cultural revolutionary army again and again. Chairman Mao's inspections were the greatest concern and the strongest support for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, and the strongest offensive and most fatal blow to the small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party.

The proletarian revolutionary fighters, greatly inspired by the great helmsman Chairman Mao's repeated inspections, advanced bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, breaking through obstacles and forging ahead, pushing the struggle against the capitalist reactionary line proposed and implemented by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party to a climax. It was under this good revolutionary situation that Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by him inspected the cultural revolutionary army for the seventh and eighth times from November 10 to 26, 1966. Chairman Mao warmly shouted to the proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary masses from all over the country: "Comrades, long live!" and issued a new great call: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the proletarian cultural revolution even better."

This is an exciting and unforgettable moment. People see in the two films, "Chairman Mao Will Always Be in Our Hearts" and "A Brilliant Example and a Great Initiative," that the vast Tiananmen Square and the tens of miles of Chang'an Street are filled with the moving songs "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." Everywhere red flags are flying, and everywhere the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are shining brightly. When the most blessed moment finally arrives and our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao comes to the cultural revolutionary army to accept the inspection, the red sea immediately surges with joyful waves. Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a spirited appearance, smiles warmly and waves to the vast cultural revolutionary army. The proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary masses, like sunflowers forever facing the red sun, shout and jump towards our greatest leader Chairman Mao. Tens of thousands of people shed tears of excitement and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Tens of thousands of people raised their arms and swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely remember your great teachings, pay attention to state affairs, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!" These two films truly and deeply portray the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary masses with hearts connected, portray the great leader Chairman Mao's unlimited trust in the masses, and the great practice and brilliant example of wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement.

Now it has been eight or nine months since Chairman Mao's seventh and eighth inspections of the cultural revolutionary army. Over the past eight or nine months, Chairman Mao's great concern and great inspiration for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have turned into great material force. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has been victorious step by step, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been even more deeply rooted in people's hearts. The great proletarian cultural revolution has entered a new stage of thoroughly smashing and thoroughly burying the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Khrushchev of China. When these two films were previewed recently, some proletarian revolutionary fighters from the capital who went to see them were greatly inspired. They said, we must draw greater spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's brilliant example, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Khrushchev of China.

    巨大关怀　巨大鼓舞　巨大支持　巨大鞭策
    首都革命群众热烈欢呼毛主席第七次检阅文化革命大军彩色纪录片上映
    据新华社十八日讯　毛主席第七次检阅文化革命大军的彩色文献纪录片——《毛主席永远和我们心连心》今天开始在首都上映，并即将在全国各地上映。毛主席第八次检阅文化革命大军的彩色文献纪录片——《光辉的榜样伟大的创举》，正在赶制拷贝，也将在首都和全国各地上映。
    这两部影片的放映，是全国人民的大喜事，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，对无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的巨大关怀，巨大鼓舞，巨大支持，巨大鞭策！
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。他老人家高瞻远瞩，深刻地洞察和总结了我国和世界各国革命的经验教训，以最伟大的气魄和最坚定的决心，在人类历史上第一次发动和领导了一场震撼全球的无产阶级文化大革命。从一九六六年八月十八日到十一月二十六日短短三个多月的时间里，毛主席先后八次接见和检阅了一千一百多万文化革命大军，这是中国革命和国际共产主义运动历史上前所未有的伟大革命创举。《毛主席永远和我们心连心》、《光辉的榜样伟大的创举》同毛主席前六次检阅文化革命大军的文献纪录影片一样，是纪录我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席这一伟大革命创举的壮丽史诗。
    一年前的八月十八日，是一个举世瞩目的日子。在党的八届十一中全会和毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的战斗号召下，向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部大举发起进攻的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在这一天汇集到天安门广场接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。毛主席站在天安门，眼望全中国，高度评价了方兴未艾的无产阶级文化大革命，指出：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”对于刚刚诞生、还遭受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和旧的习惯势力各种非难、压制的红卫兵，毛主席向他们坚定地表示：“我坚决支持你们！”
    但是，以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部和他的代理人，和一切反动的阶级一样，不甘心退出历史舞台。在毛主席第一次检阅文化革命大军之后，他们仍然疯狂抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，利用他们在政治上、思想上、理论上的一些影响和当时还把持着的一些权势，采用各种卑劣的手段，继续蒙蔽、挑动不明真相的群众，对无产阶级革命派进行压制和围攻，妄图破坏和扼杀轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。在两条路线斗争的这个紧要关头，无产阶级革命派眼望毛主席语录，心向天安门，更加思念伟大领袖毛主席；始终和革命群众同呼吸、共命运的毛主席，最了解革命群众的处境和心情，一次又一次地检阅了文化革命大军。毛主席的检阅，是对无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的最大关怀和最有力的支持，是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的最强大的攻势和最致命的打击。
    从伟大统帅毛主席一次又一次的检阅中受到巨大鼓舞的无产阶级革命派战士，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，披荆斩棘，奋勇向前，把对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线的斗争，推向了高潮。正是在这种大好的革命形势下，毛主席和以他老人家为首的无产阶级司令部，又从一九六六年十一月十日到二十六日第七次、第八次检阅了文化革命大军。毛主席向来自各地的无产阶级革命派战士和革命群众亲切高呼：“同志们万岁！”并且发出了新的伟大号召：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    这是激动人心的难忘的时刻。人们从《毛主席永远和我们心连心》和《光辉的榜样伟大的创举》两部影片中看到，宽广的天安门广场和绵延数十里的东西长安大街，到处响彻着《大海航行靠舵手》和《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》的动人歌声，到处都飘扬着红旗，到处都是红彤彤的《毛主席语录》在闪闪发光。当最最幸福的时刻终于到来，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席来到了接受检阅的文化革命大军当中的时候，红色的海洋顿时翻起欢腾的巨浪。毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，向着浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军亲切微笑，招手致意。无产阶级革命派战士和革命群众，犹如朵朵葵花永远向着红太阳那样，向着我们最伟大的领袖毛主席欢呼、跳跃。千千万万人流下了激动的热泪，同声高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”千千万万人振臂宣誓：“毛主席呀毛主席！我们一定要牢记您的伟大教导，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这两部影片真实而深刻地表现了伟大领袖毛主席和无产阶级革命派心连心，表现了伟大领袖毛主席无限信任群众，全心全意地支持革命群众运动的伟大实践和光辉榜样。
    现在离毛主席第七次、第八次检阅文化革命大军已经八九个月了。八九个月来，毛主席对无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的这一巨大关怀、巨大鼓舞变成了巨大的物质力量，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利，战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加深入人心，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了彻底摧毁和彻底埋葬以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的新阶段。这两部影片最近预映时，前往观看的首都一些无产阶级革命派战士无限振奋。他们说，我们一定要从毛主席的光辉榜样中汲取更大的精神力量，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
