Thai Patriotic Front representative Paron Chularat introduced the excellent situation of the armed struggle in Thailand at a commemorative meeting for the second anniversary of the Thai people's armed struggle on August 7. He said that the victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949 resonated across Thailand, bringing Mao Zedong Thought to Thailand and guiding the Thai people in their national democratic revolution. Mao's ideas of surrounding the cities from the countryside and "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" have been embodied in the struggle of the Thai revolutionary people.

The meeting was organized by a study group composed of revolutionary fighters from Africa and the Arab regions who are working in Beijing. Participants included revolutionary fighters from 27 countries across six continents.

Paron Chularat emphasized in his report that under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces have achieved great victories in their armed struggle by applying Mao's thoughts on surrounding the cities from the countryside and "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." He said that although the Thai people's armed forces are facing "encirclement and suppression" by American imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat fascist clique, they have grown stronger under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party by applying Mao Zedong Thought and unleashing the power of people's war. In the past two years, the enemy's "encirclement" plans have been completely foiled, and the enemy is now in a passive position. The people's armed forces can now take the initiative to strike the enemy in various ways. Currently, the people's armed forces are active in 23 out of 71 provinces in Thailand's northeastern, southern, central, and northern regions.

Paron Chularat said that the politically conscious Thai people increasingly recognize the necessity of taking up arms to defend themselves and strive for liberation. Since the enemy uses force to suppress us, we must take up arms to defend ourselves and resolve the issue of national independence through armed struggle. He said that currently, many different revolutionary organizations in Thailand have been established and joined the Thai Patriotic Front to drive out American imperialist invaders and overthrow the traitorous Thai government.

Paron Chularat strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionists for colluding with American imperialism and the Thai reactionary ruling clique to spread the fallacies of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition." They organize traitors and social dregs to use various dirty tactics to sabotage the Thai people's revolutionary struggle, even supporting reactionary armed forces and opposing the people's armed forces. He emphasized that to oppose imperialism led by the United States, one must also oppose modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists and smash the "three peaceful" line of modern revisionism.

Paron Chularat said that the Thai people regard the armed struggle victories of people from other countries as their own victories. The Thai people will actively support the brothers who are preparing for and conducting armed struggles in various countries. The Thai people and revolutionary people from various countries will advance hand in hand under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary fighters from Laos, Burma, Indonesia, and Malaya, as well as representatives from the revolutionary comrades' study group in Africa and the Arab regions, enthusiastically applauded the Thai people and Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary people for their magnificent armed struggles under the guidance of Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war. They congratulated the Thai people on their great victories in the armed struggle.

The commemorative meeting concluded with Sudanese representative Keer reading a telegram from revolutionary comrades from 27 countries working in Beijing, expressing their support for the Thai people's armed struggle.

    泰国爱国阵线代表帕荣·朱拉暖介绍泰国武装斗争的大好形势
    以毛泽东思想作武器打出一个人民的泰国
    谴责苏修勾结美帝和泰国反动派破坏泰国人民革命斗争
    据新华社八日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖七日在一次纪念泰国人民武装斗争两周年的纪念会上说，一九四九年中国革命胜利的炮声，响彻了泰国的上空，给泰国送来了毛泽东思想，给泰国爱国的革命的人民指明殖民地、半殖民地进行民族民主革命的道路，毛主席关于农村包围城市和“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想也已经在泰国革命人民的斗争中体现出来了。
    这次纪念会是由在北京工作的非洲和阿拉伯地区的革命战士组成的学习小组举办的。参加会的有来自六大洲二十七个国家的革命战士。
    帕荣·朱拉暖在报告中着重介绍了泰国人民武装力量在泰国共产党的领导下，运用毛主席关于农村包围城市和“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，所取得的人民武装斗争的伟大胜利。他说，泰国人民武装力量虽然受着美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博法西斯集团的“围剿”和镇压，但是，泰国人民武装力量在泰国共产党的领导下，运用了毛泽东思想，发挥人民战争的威力，因此，泰国武装力量越战越强。两年来，敌人的全部“围剿”计划遭到彻底的破产，敌人已处于被动地位，人民武装力量能够以各种方式主动地打击敌人。目前，人民武装力量已在泰国东北部、南部、中部和北部，全国七十一个府中的二十三个府的广大地区进行活动。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，富有政治觉悟的泰国人民越来越认识到拿起武器、保卫自己、争取解放的必要性。既然敌人以武力来镇压我们，我们就必须要拿起武器进行自卫，以武装斗争的形式解决争取国家独立的问题。他说，当前，泰国许多不同的革命组织相继成立，并参加了泰国爱国阵线，为赶走美帝国主义侵略者和推翻泰国卖国政府而进行斗争。
    帕荣·朱拉暖强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义联合美帝国主义勾结泰国反动统治集团，散布“和平共处”“和平竞赛”“和平过渡”的谬论；组织叛徒和社会渣滓，采取各种肮脏的手段，破坏泰国人民的革命斗争，甚至支持反动的武装力量，反对人民的武装力量。他强调指出，要反对美国为首的帝国主义就必须反对以苏修集团为首的现代修正主义，砸烂现代修正主义的“三和”路线。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，泰国人民把各国人民的武装斗争的胜利当作自己的胜利，泰国人民将积极地支持准备和正在开展武装斗争的各国兄弟。泰国人民和各国革命人民，将在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，携手并进。参加纪念会的老挝、缅甸、印尼、马来亚的革命战士，以及非洲、阿拉伯地区革命同志学习小组的代表，热烈欢呼泰国人民和亚非拉革命人民在毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想指导下所开展的轰轰烈烈的武装斗争，祝贺泰国人民在武装斗争中所取得的巨大胜利。
    纪念会最后由苏丹凯尔宣读了在北京工作的二十七个国家的革命派同志支持泰国人民武装斗争的电文。
