We of the Gear Playhouse are fortunate and honored to be visiting Beijing, the red bastion of world revolution, at this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing from victory to victory. The purpose of our visit to China is to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to ensure that our troupe firmly grasps the direction of proletarian revolutionary literature and art; and to strengthen and develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

As soon as we set foot on Chinese soil, we were warmly welcomed. Everywhere we went, we saw a new revolutionary atmosphere. In particular, the broad masses of revolutionary people, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, dared to think and dare to act, breaking with the private and establishing the public, which inspired and educated us greatly. Chinese comrades also organized for us to appreciate the revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women," the clay sculpture "The Opium War," and the play "Song of the Stormy Night," as well as other excellent performances and exhibitions, from which we learned a great deal.

For this visit to China, we have prepared two plays: "Wildfire" and "Advancing into the Storm." Both plays were created under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. After arriving in China, we received enthusiastic help from Chinese comrades during our rehearsals. Especially the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically supported us, which helped raise the level of our performances. First of all, it prompted us to launch a struggle to eliminate the bad influences of "realism" and the "theory of intermediate characters" that remained in the original scripts, performances, and performances. We once again studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and Chairman Mao's relevant quotations such as "Promoting a spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, and daring to get tired, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After more than ten days of rehearsals, the play "Wildfire" finally met the audience on August 12. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for the lofty internationalism of the Chinese people.

Taking the opportunity of performing "Wildfire" and "Advancing into the Storm" in China, we would like to briefly share with the Chinese audience how our Gear Playhouse has grown through struggle.

Our Gear Playhouse was born in April 1952, during the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's invasion of Korea, in the patriotic struggle against the United States. Over the past decade, we have always been with the workers, peasants, and laboring people, experiencing all kinds of struggles. In 1967, after breaking with the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, we also expelled a handful of revisionist elements within the troupe, and as a truly revolutionary troupe, we embarked on a new path.

On the morning of New Year's Day 1967, we joyfully hung a portrait of Chairman Mao high in our rehearsal hall, posted big-character posters, and called on everyone to deeply study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. All the members of the troupe took an oath together: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely be good students of Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary writers and artists must go among the people, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly. They must go into the fiery struggle, into the only vast and rich source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all lively forms of life and struggle, all original materials for literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." Following this teaching, we carried the task of creating a script reflecting the awakening of rural youth, "Sprouts," and in February 1967, we went deep into the mountainous village of Yabu.

In the past, we hardly knew anything about farming. After going to the countryside, we lived in the homes of poor peasants and learned farming and charcoal burning from the farmers. In the evenings, we learned about the lives and struggles of the peasant masses. We saw with our own eyes how the peasants toiled like oxen and horses but could not get enough to eat. They were fighting against the brutal plunder of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, which deeply moved us and strengthened our resolve to reflect the peasants' struggle of resistance. At the same time, we also realized that our thinking urgently needed to be transformed, that is, "we must shift our standpoint," "shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat." After this period of tempering, our thoughts and feelings began to change. We swept away the bad habits that had existed in the Gear Playhouse in the past, that is, although we knew nothing, we wanted to teach others on stage, or although we dressed up as workers and peasants on the surface, in reality, we were full of petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. After learning from the peasants, we created and performed "Sprouts," which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants in Yamaguchi Prefecture. They unanimously encouraged us, saying: "This path is correct. As long as you continue to advance in the direction guided by Chairman Mao, you will definitely create better works!"

To create the children's play "The Heavenly Dog's Club," we went deep into the Suzu Mountain coal mine and lived with the coal miners and their children. Although the children's class of the troupe had been touring schools all over the country for years, they had never eaten, lived, and studied with the children of workers. The life of miners is very hard, and they often work under the threat of accidents due to poor safety equipment. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Many of the children of Suzu Mountain had participated in demonstrations carried on their mothers' backs and grown up in the songs of struggle. Living with these children of workers played an important role in establishing a proletarian perspective in our creation and popularization of children's plays.

In January 1967, to promote the realization of the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival, Yamaguchi Prefecture held a large parade. This revolutionary action greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the people of the entire prefecture and the entire country, thus launching a new high tide of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. In March, the entire prefecture of Yamaguchi held a general mobilization meeting, and the waves of struggle rose higher and higher. Our comrades of the Gear Playhouse also personally participated in these struggles and saw many heroic deeds of anti-revisionist fighters from various places. Among them, the struggle of the automobile workers deeply moved us. They were not afraid of the crazy suppression of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fighting for the true realization of Japan-China friendship. We specially connected with them. Thus, in the workers' dormitories or the troupe's rehearsal hall, the songs of struggle echoed almost every day. When we rehearsed, the workers came to give us suggestions, and usually, our members were also often seen among the masses of automobile workers. In this way, after more than a month of incubation, discussion, and multiple revisions, we finally created "Advancing into the Storm." This work reflects from all aspects the moving scenes of the revolutionary masses of Yamaguchi Prefecture studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the specific examples of how young workers who insist on struggle learn from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The current international situation is excellent. The revolutionary people of Japan, inspired by the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, have also raised the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. We of the Gear Playhouse have decided to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely fight to the end with the enemy!

Here, let us once again express our deep respect and gratitude to the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese people!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    沿着毛主席指引的方向前进
    日本　齿轮座访华演出团
    我们齿轮座能够在中国无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利的时刻，来到世界革命的红色堡垒——北京访问演出，感到十分幸福和光荣。我们这次访华演出的目的是：进一步活学活用毛主席著作，使我们剧团牢牢掌握无产阶级革命文艺的方向；加强和发展日中两国人民在反帝反修斗争中的战斗友谊。
    当我们刚一踏上中国的国土，就受到了热情的欢迎。我们到处看到的都是一片革命的新气象。特别是广大的革命群众，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，敢想敢干，破“私”立“公”的革命精神，使我们得到很大的启发和教育。中国有关的人员，还组织我们欣赏了革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、泥塑群像《收租院》和话剧《夜海战歌》等优秀的演出和展览，使我们学到了不少东西。
    这次访华演出，我们准备了《野火》和《迎着暴风雨前进》两个话剧。这两个话剧都是在毛泽东思想的指导下，在反对美日反动派的火热斗争中创作出来的。这次到中国之后，在排练的过程中又得到了中国同志的热情帮助。特别是广大工农兵群众对我们的热情支持，使我们的演出得到了提高。首先促使我们展开了肃清原剧本中、表演中和演出中残存的“写真实论”、“中间人物论”等坏影响的斗争。我们再一次学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》《中国社会各阶级的分析》《湖南农民运动考察报告》和毛主席的“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”等有关语录。经过十多天的排练，《野火》这个话剧终于在八月十二日和观众见面了。这是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是中国人民崇高的国际主义精神的胜利。
    借着《野火》和《迎着暴风雨前进》在中国演出的机会，我们愿意向中国的观众，简单地谈谈我们齿轮座剧团是怎么样在斗争中成长起来的。
    我们齿轮座是在一九五二年四月，在日本人民反对美帝国主义侵朝战争的反美爱国斗争中诞生的。建团十多年来，我们一直和工农劳动人民在一起，经历过各种各样的斗争。一九六七年，我们和日共修正主义集团决裂以后，又在剧团内部开除了一小撮修正主义分子，作为一个真正革命的剧团，才走上了新生的道路。
    一九六七年元旦的清晨，我们欢欣鼓舞地在剧团的排练场内，高高地挂起毛主席像，贴出革命的大字报，号召大家深入学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，学习中国的无产阶级文化大革命。全体团员一起宣誓：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决做毛主席的好学生。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”我们遵循着这一教导，带着创作反映农村青年觉醒的剧本《萌芽》的任务，于一九六七年二月深入到山区弥富的农村。
    过去，我们几乎都不懂得农活，到农村后住在贫农家里，我们就向农民学习农活和烧炭，晚上便了解农民群众的生活和斗争。我们亲眼看到农民们就象牛马般地辛勤劳动而不得温饱，他们正在为反对美、日反动派的残酷掠夺而斗争，这使我们深受感动，并加强了我们要反映农民反抗斗争的决心，同时也认识到自己的思想迫切需要改造，也就是说“一定要把立足点移过来”，“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”经过这一段锻炼，我们的思想感情开始有了变化。我们扫清了过去齿轮座存在的恶习，即自己虽然什么也不懂，却要在舞台上教训别人，或者表面上打扮成工农的样子，但实际上却完全是小资产阶级的思想感情。我们向农民学习之后创作和演出的《萌芽》，受到了山口县广大工农观众的热烈欢迎。他们异口同声地鼓励我们说：“这条路走得对，今后只要你们坚持按照毛主席教导的方向前进，一定会创作出更好的作品！”
    为了创作儿童剧《天狗棒子》，我们又深入到冲之山煤矿，和煤矿工人以及工人的孩子们共同生活。剧团的儿童班虽然长年在全国各地的学校里巡回演出，但是从没有和工人的孩子们同吃同住同学习过。矿工的生活是很艰苦的，他们经常在安全设备很差、随时都可能出事故的威胁下劳动。有压迫就有反抗，冲之山的孩子们，有许多是被母亲背着参加游行，在斗争的歌声中成长的。和这些工人的孩子们生活在一起，对我们在创作和普及儿童剧方面树立无产阶级的观点起了重要的作用。
    一九六七年一月间，为了促进实现第二届日中青年大联欢，山口县进行了大游行。这次革命行动大大鼓舞了全县、全国人民的斗志，从而掀起了反帝、反修的新高潮。三月间全山口县又举行了总奋起大会，斗争的浪潮一浪高一浪。我们齿轮座的同志也亲身参加了这些斗争，看到了各地反修战士的许多英勇事迹。其中，汽车工人的斗争深深地感动了我们。他们不怕美日反动派疯狂的镇压，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为真正实现日中友好而斗争。我们特地和他们进行了串连。于是，在工人宿舍或剧团的排练场，几乎每天都荡漾着战斗的歌声。我们排练时工人就来给我们提意见，平时我们的团员也不断出现在汽车工人群众中间。就这样，经过了一个多月的酝酿、讨论和多次修改，终于创作出了《迎着暴风雨前进》。这个作品从各个方面反映了我们山口县革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的动人情景，以及坚持斗争的青年工人怎样进行自我改造，向中国无产阶级文化大革命学习的具体的事例。
    目前国际形势一片大好。日本的革命人民在中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利的鼓舞下，也高举起了反帝、反修的大旗。我们齿轮座决定进一步活学活用毛主席著作，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在毛泽东思想的指引下，坚决与敌人斗争到底！
    在这里，让我们再一次向伟大的毛主席和中国人民表示深切的敬意和谢意！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（附图片）
