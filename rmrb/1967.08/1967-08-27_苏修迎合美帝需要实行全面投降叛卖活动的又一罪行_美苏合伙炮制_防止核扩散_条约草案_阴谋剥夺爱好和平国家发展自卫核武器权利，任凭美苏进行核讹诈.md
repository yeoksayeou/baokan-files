The Soviet revisionists, in order to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism, have committed another serious crime by fully surrendering and betraying the cause. The U.S. and the Soviet Union have jointly drafted a "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft, aiming to deprive peace-loving countries of their right to develop nuclear weapons for self-defense, allowing the U.S. and the Soviet Union to engage in nuclear blackmail.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 25th, a message from Geneva stated: On the 24th, the U.S. and the Soviet Union formally presented their jointly drafted "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft at the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 17 nations. The unveiling of this big deception is an important result of the direct secret talks and plotting of the counter-revolutionary global conspiracy by the U.S. and Soviet leaders, Johnson and Kosygin, in Glassboro this June. It is a new and serious crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership in adapting to the needs of U.S. imperialism and carrying out a policy of complete surrender and betrayal.

In order to jointly suppress China and oppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have long been colluding with each other, using every possible means to create nuclear deceptions and maintain their nuclear monopoly. They not only drafted the infamous Moscow Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 but have also been busy plotting the dirty deal of "preventing nuclear proliferation." After long negotiations and especially because of the Soviet revisionists' repeated major concessions to the U.S. imperialists, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had reached a substantial agreement on this deal at the resumption of the Disarmament Conference in February this year. When Kosygin personally went to the U.S. to conspire with Johnson to tighten the counter-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in June, they decided to accelerate the pace of the "non-proliferation" deal. It is revealed that U.S. officials admitted that the talks between Johnson and Kosygin were a "promoting factor" for the presentation of this draft, providing it with the "final, official, high-level approval."

The main contents of the treaty draft jointly announced by the U.S. and the Soviet Union are: Among the signatory countries, those that possess nuclear weapons shall not directly or indirectly enable non-nuclear weapon states to obtain or control nuclear weapons; non-nuclear states shall not manufacture, accept, or control nuclear weapons, nor seek or accept assistance to manufacture nuclear weapons. According to the draft, participating non-nuclear states can only rely on nuclear states for the peaceful use of atomic energy and cannot develop or obtain nuclear explosive devices themselves. It is clear that these regulations aim to openly deprive peace-loving countries of their right to develop nuclear weapons for self-defense, allowing the U.S. and the Soviet Union to wield the nuclear big stick and engage in nuclear blackmail. At the same time, the two nuclear superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, impose restrictions on the peaceful use of atomic energy by non-nuclear states, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union can continue to develop nuclear weapons without any restrictions. This barefacedly exposes the sinister intentions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to further promote nuclear monopoly, nuclear hegemony, and nuclear blackmail.

To control non-nuclear states, the U.S. and the Soviet Union unanimously advocate including a clause in the treaty for "international supervision" of the non-nuclear states that sign the treaty. However, due to the dissatisfaction of many countries with this approach, they have not been able to reach an agreement on the specific regulations of this clause. Therefore, this clause is temporarily left blank in the draft, pending further negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Just as the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, along with reactionaries from various countries, are launching an anti-China wave and the U.S. is frantically expanding its aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. and the Soviet Union jointly present this treaty draft. Its main target is the Chinese people who firmly oppose the nuclear deceptions created by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it creates an atmosphere for further U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the Vietnam issue. The Associated Press reported without any disguise that "the most significant aspect of the action to propose this treaty is that the Soviet Union is willing to show Soviet-American cooperation at a time when the situation in Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly tense."

Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union are eager to submit a complete draft to the United Nations General Assembly this autumn as soon as possible. However, due to the dissatisfaction of many countries with the U.S.-Soviet nuclear hegemony policy and the existing contradictions between the U.S. and its allies on this treaty, Western news agencies believe that "many tough negotiations" will still be needed before the treaty is signed.

France, a member of the United Nations 18-nation Disarmament Committee, has never participated in the Geneva Disarmament Conference.

    苏修迎合美帝需要实行全面投降叛卖活动的又一罪行
    美苏合伙炮制“防止核扩散”条约草案
    阴谋剥夺爱好和平国家发展自卫核武器权利，任凭美苏进行核讹诈
    据新华社二十五日讯  日内瓦消息：美苏在二十四日举行的日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议上，正式抛出了它们合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案。这个大骗局的出笼，是美苏两家头目约翰逊和柯西金今年六月在葛拉斯堡罗直接密谈、策划反革命全球大阴谋的一个重要结果，是苏联修正主义领导集团适应美帝国主义的需要、实行全面投降叛卖的新的严重罪行。
    美帝和苏修为了联合反华，镇压世界人民的革命斗争，多年来一直互相勾结，千方百计地制造核骗局，维护它们的核垄断。它们不仅在一九六三年炮制出臭名昭著的莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约，而且一直在加紧策划“防止核扩散”的肮脏交易。经过长期的讨价还价，特别是由于苏修不断向美帝作出重大让步，美苏在今年二月“裁军”会议复会时，已经就这项交易达成了实质上的协议。在今年六月柯西金亲自跑到美国去同约翰逊密谋加紧美苏反革命全球大勾结时，他们更决定加快“防止核扩散”交易的步伐。据透露，美国官员承认，约翰逊和柯西金的会谈对这个草案的提出是一种“促进因素”，给它提供了“最后的、官方的、高级的认可”。
    美苏联合宣布的这项条约草案的主要内容是：在缔约国当中，凡是拥有核武器的国家，都不得直接或间接使无核武器国家得到或控制核武器；凡是“无核国家”，都不得制造、接受或控制核武器，也不得寻求或接受帮助来制造核武器。根据草案的规定，参加签字的“无核国家”在和平利用原子能方面，只能由“核国家”提供条件，而不得自己发展或获得核爆炸装置。很明显，这些规定就是要公开剥夺爱好和平的国家发展自卫核武器的权利，而任凭美苏挥舞核大棒，进行核讹诈；与此同时，美苏两个核霸王对“无核国家”和平利用原子能也一律横加限制，而美苏却可以不受任何约束地继续发展核武器。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美苏进一步大搞核垄断、核霸权、核讹诈的险恶居心。
    为了对“无核国家”进行控制，美苏一致主张在条约中列入对参加签字的“无核国家”实行“国际监督”的条款。但是由于美苏这种做法引起许多国家的不满，它们一直没有能就这项条款的具体规定达成协议。因此，在草案中这一条暂时空了下来，留待美苏两家继续做交易。
    正当美帝苏修和各国反动派掀起反华浪潮以及美帝疯狂扩大侵越战争的时候，美苏合伙抛出这个条约草案，其矛头首先是指向坚决反对美苏制造核骗局的中国人民，同时，为美苏进一步在越南问题上的交易制造气氛。美联社在报道中毫不掩饰地说，“提出这个条约的行动的最有意义的方面就是，苏联愿意在东南亚局势急剧紧张化的时候显示苏美合作”。
    美苏都急切要求早日把一项完整的草案提交今年秋天的联合国大会。但是由于许多国家对美苏的核霸权政策不满以及美国和它的盟国在这个条约上还存在矛盾，西方通讯社认为，在条约缔结以前，“还要进行许多艰苦的讨价还价”。
    联合国十八国“裁军”委员会的成员国法国，始终没有参加日内瓦的“裁军”会议。
