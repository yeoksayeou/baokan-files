The guerrilla forces in the southern region of South Vietnam have recently coordinated with the main forces to launch extensive attacks, striking the enemy from the American stronghold of Saigon to the southernmost tip of South Vietnam at Cape St. Jacques, and defeating the enemy decisively.

According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the guerrilla forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region, on the night of the 17th, closely coordinated with the main forces of the Liberation Armed Forces to launch a surprise attack on the 37th Special Forces Camp of the puppet army in Go Vap District, Gia Dinh Province. In just a few minutes, they killed 200 enemy soldiers and captured 10. The guerrilla forces in the districts of Go Vap and Hoc Mon in Gia Dinh Province have been continuously attacking the enemy on the transportation lines. In the first ten days of July, they eliminated more than 200 enemy soldiers, the majority of whom were American aggressors; destroyed 10 enemy armored vehicles, shot down 7 aircraft, and sank 1 landing craft. A guerrilla squad used only six landmines to destroy six enemy armored vehicles and eliminate more than 100 American aggressors.

The guerrilla forces in the southern part of South Vietnam are constantly seeking opportunities to penetrate enemy strongholds and eliminate the enemy. On the night of June 30, the guerrilla forces in a commune of Vung Liem District, Hau Nghia Province, infiltrated the base of a puppet army battalion of the 21st Division, using grenades and explosive packages to destroy the battalion command post, killing and wounding more than 80 enemy soldiers. On July 11, the guerrilla forces and local forces in the Phuoc Long area of My Tho Province launched an attack on a "strategic hamlet," annihilating more than 50 puppet field police and 25 members of a "pacification" squad. The guerrilla forces have been continuously attacking American-puppet military bases, "training centers," and puppet government institutions, destroying many "strategic hamlets," and striking fear into the hearts of the American-puppet forces, causing many puppet soldiers and "pacification" spies to desert.

The guerrilla forces in the Phuoc Long area of My Tho Province have been using tactics such as sniping, setting up active grenades, and traps to continuously wear down the enemy's fighting strength, accumulating small victories into a big victory, and eliminating 700 American aggressors in two months.

The guerrilla forces in the southern part of South Vietnam have been continuously smashing the "sweeps" of the American-puppet forces and ambushing the enemy on roads and waterways, punishing American aggressors and evil puppet military and political figures in occupied cities. They have set up a people's war net, striking the American-puppet forces and making them panic.

    配合主力军英勇作战　摧毁“战略村”严惩美国侵略强盗
    南越南部游击队布下天罗地网痛歼敌军
    新华社河内电　越南南方南部地区游击队，最近配合主力部队广泛出击，从美国侵略军巢穴的西贡到南越最南端的金瓯角，把敌人打得落花流水。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，西贡—嘉定地区的游击队十七日夜间和解放武装力量主力部队密切配合，奇袭嘉定省古芝县的伪军第三十七别动营，在几分钟内就打死敌人二百名，俘虏十名。嘉定省鹅邑、旭门两县游击队在交通线上连续袭击敌人，在七月份的头十天内就消灭敌人两百多名，其中绝大部分是美国强盗；击毁敌人装甲车十辆，击落飞机七架，击沉登陆艇一艘。一支游击分队只用六颗地雷就炸毁敌人装甲车六辆，消灭美国侵略军一百多名。
    南越南部游击队不断寻找战机，深入敌人巢穴消灭敌人。朔庄省永利县一个乡的游击队，在六月三十日夜间潜入伪军第二十一师一个营的驻地，用手榴弹和炸药包炸毁了这个伪军的营指挥所，打死打伤敌人八十多名。美萩省平德地区的游击队和地方部队七月十一日向一个“战略村”的敌人发起攻击，歼灭伪野战警察五十多名和伪军一个“绥靖”队二十五名。游击队不断袭击美伪军基地、“训练中心”和伪政权机构，摧毁了许多“战略村”，打得美伪军日夜惶恐，许多伪军和“绥靖”特务因此开了小差。
    美萩省平德地区的游击队，用打冷枪、设活动手榴弹和陷阱等办法不断地消耗敌人的有生力量，积小胜为大胜，在两个月内共消灭美国强盗七百名。
    南越南部的游击队不断粉碎美伪军的“扫荡”和在公路、河道上截击敌人，在敌占城市内惩罚美国强盗和作恶多端的伪军政人员。他们张开人民战争的天罗地网，打得美伪军焦头烂额。
