The radio station reported that on July 26, the patriotic military and civilians in the Mong Noy area of Luang Prabang Province eliminated 109 enemy soldiers in a counter-“sweeping” operation. Earlier, the guerrillas and people of this province used landmines to kill and injure 10 enemy soldiers and bandits who were harassing the liberated areas on July 2 and 6.

On July 30, the guerrillas, local forces, and people in the Phalawi area of Vientiane Province bravely attacked an enemy camp command post. Preliminary reports indicate that in this battle, the patriotic military and civilians killed 20 enemy soldiers on the spot, wounded many, and destroyed two enemy cannons.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Kheang Khay on August 16, the Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted that from June 11 to July 30, the patriotic military and civilians in the Phalawi and other areas of Borikhan County, Vientiane Province, fought bravely and smashed the so-called “unity” campaign of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving great victories.

The broadcast said that during this period, the patriotic military and civilians in the above-mentioned areas eliminated 84 enemy soldiers and destroyed two recoilless rifles.

Another broadcast reported that on July 26, the patriotic military and civilians in Luang Prabang Province, in their counterattack against the enemy's “sweeping” operations in the Ban Khao, Xieng Ngeun County's Taba and Nam Thou areas, and other regions, eliminated 34 enemy soldiers, seized a batch of weapons and military supplies, and blew up a bridge on National Highway 13 in the northern part of Xieng Ngeun County.

The report stated that in order to attack the liberated areas of Laos, the U.S. imperialists dispatched dozens of helicopters on July 14 and 15 to air-drop many South Vietnamese commandos into the Ban Ha area of Tavoy County, Xam Neua Province. The report said that on July 15, when the U.S. helicopters had just air-dropped 101 commandos to the ground, the alert patriotic military and civilians of Tavoy County immediately surrounded the enemy. When the enemy discovered this situation, they dispatched three helicopters to urgently evacuate the enemy on the ground. The Lao patriotic military and civilians immediately opened fierce fire, annihilating all 101 commandos and three helicopters.

The report said that to cover up its aggressive actions, the U.S. imperialists dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to bomb the area after the battle, killing all the wounded South Vietnamese soldiers who were still on the battlefield.

The Lao People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft troops stationed at the front of Phou Kout Mountain are standing by, ready to strike at any daring American aggressors at any time.
