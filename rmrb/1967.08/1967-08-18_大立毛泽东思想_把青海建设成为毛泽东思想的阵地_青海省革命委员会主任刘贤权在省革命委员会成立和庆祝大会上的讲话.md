Comrades of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, comrades of the People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, comrades of the Red Guards, and fellow fighters:

The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, under the wise leadership and personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao, and directly led by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, is officially established today! This is another great victory for the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a great victory for the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Qinghai issue, and a great victory song of the proletarian cultural revolution resounding across the sky in our country!

On this grandest day for all the people of Qinghai, we sincerely wish our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long live Chairman Mao!

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Qinghai Military Region and various units stationed in Qinghai have, following Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly and vigorously supported the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary factions, making significant contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution in Qinghai, establishing new merits, and we salute them with proletarian cultural revolution greetings!

During the process of the proletarian cultural revolution in our province, Red Guards from the capital and various parts of the country who came to Qinghai for revolutionary exchanges have fought side by side with us, shared the same breath, and shared the same fate, giving us great support and encouragement. We salute them with proletarian cultural revolution greetings!

Seizing power relies on Mao Zedong Thought

Today, as we celebrate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, let us correctly understand how, over the past year, we overcame numerous difficulties and obstacles, and from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, seized back the power of the party, government, finance, and culture. This is of great significance.

One year ago, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee further established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, confirmed Comrade Lin Biao, who consistently holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, as the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough executor of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as the deputy helmsman of the entire party, further consolidated the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and defeated the bourgeois headquarters led by the biggest capitalist-roader within the party. The documents of the plenary session, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, further systematically solved the theory, line, policy, methods, and measures for conducting revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and pointed out the bright path for consolidating proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration to the people of the entire country. At this historic plenary session of great significance, our great leader Chairman Mao published the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters."

Chairman Mao's big-character poster said: "The first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country and the editorial of the People's Daily are written so well! Please read this big-character poster and this editorial again. Yet, in more than fifty days, from the central to local levels, some leading comrades have done the opposite, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the fiery proletarian cultural revolution, confusing right and wrong, mixing black and white, besieging the revolutionary factions, suppressing different opinions, and practicing white terror. They are so pleased with themselves, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and crushing the spirit of the proletariat. How poisonous it is! Linking it to the rightist deviation in 1962 and the pseudo-leftist but actually rightist erroneous tendency in 1964, can it not be a profound awakening?"

Chairman Mao's big-character poster is another great "signal gun" opening a new era in human history, a decisive victory in conducting revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, a cannon shot to smash the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, and a guarantee that our party and country will never change color for thousands of generations. Thus, it made the entire party and the people of the country further understand the main target and main task of this proletarian cultural revolution.

Over the past year, we, the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary factions, in the struggle to the death with the class enemy, have closely followed our great leader Chairman Mao, closely followed the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao, and closely followed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Each of our victories is the great achievement of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the great achievement of the "Sixteen Points," the great victory of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters," the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the victory of great Mao Zedong Thought.

It was Chairman Mao who ignited the blazing fire of the cultural revolution in Qinghai. It was the magic mirror and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought that exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee. These representatives of the bourgeoisie were the black hands of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party stretching into Qinghai, the nails he drove into Qinghai. For a long time, these scoundrels, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, maliciously slandered our great leader Chairman Mao, fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought, resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and obstructed the study of Chairman Mao's works. They fawned over the Chinese Khrushchev, loyally implemented the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. In the Four Cleanups movement, they practiced pseudo-leftism but actually rightism, pushed the "three selfs and one contract" in agricultural and pastoral areas, practiced the line of capitulation in the united front with nationalities, pushed the revisionist line in education and literature and arts, and in personnel issues, formed cliques, recruited defectors, struck down a large number of revolutionary cadres, protected and promoted bad elements, usurped the power of the party, government, finance, and culture, and practiced bourgeois dictatorship. They arrogantly proclaimed, "Rebuild the party, reorganize the government, and re-recognize cadres." They fully implemented the revisionist program, line, policy, and measures of the Chinese Khrushchev in the fields of politics, economy, culture, and ideology, launching a fierce attack on the proletariat, engaging in evil activities of capitalist restoration. In the great cultural revolution, they stubbornly served as the vanguard of the reactionary bourgeois line concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev, playing tricks and practicing white terror, suppressing the revolutionary mass movement.

We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, fearing neither heaven nor earth, brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and bravely charging against the reactionary bourgeois line. When the class enemy saw their imminent downfall, they resorted to desperate measures, creating a horrifying new counterattack of the reactionary bourgeois line. We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought, with the firm belief of defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line at the cost of our lives, fought bravely against the class enemy. "With sacrifice comes great ambition, daring to change the heavens and earth." In the days of white terror, no matter how the class enemy persecuted us, we were all devoted to Chairman Mao and the party. Some comrades, when persecuted, neither complained nor cried out in pain. As long as they took out the beloved portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, they would be spirited and full of strength. Comrades, dear fellow fighters of the "August 18" revolutionary factions, what kind of power is this? What kind of spirit is this? It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that gives us this power, the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. We should learn from those comrades who firmly defend Chairman Mao, firmly defend Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; learn from those comrades who, under the suppression of the enemy, firmly fight against the reactionary bourgeois line.

Under the wise decision of our great leader Chairman Mao, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Qinghai, and with the brave struggle of the "August 18" revolutionary factions, we thoroughly smashed the counterrevolutionary restoration tide, and the radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the Qinghai Plateau, saving the proletarian cultural revolution in Qinghai.

We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, following the course charted by Chairman Mao, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, achieved revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination" on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The conservative organizations in Qinghai, under the manipulation of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee, were harmed and poisoned politically, striking down the "August 18" revolutionary factions and destroying the feelings of class brotherhood. Some bad elements within the conservative organizations even persecuted the "August 18" revolutionary factions cruelly. In this situation, how to win over, educate, and unite the broad masses who were deceived to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line was a very arduous and complex problem. We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, with the support and help of the PLA leftist support teams, firmly followed Chairman Mao's words, correctly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, and drew the line between the capitalist-roaders and the deceived masses; drew the line between the deceived masses doing bad things and the bad elements doing bad things. We firmly struck down the capitalist-roaders and firmly suppressed a few bad elements. The broad deceived masses, even if they made this or that mistake, were innocent and were our class brothers. We united with them, helped them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and together with them, we fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bad elements, preventing and overcoming the erroneous tendency and practice of wanting to create "red terror" and "only touching the skin to touch the soul." We firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, deeply exposing, denouncing, criticizing, and fighting against the biggest capitalist-roader within the party and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee, educating the masses in the struggle, raising the awareness of the deceived masses, and making them draw a clear line with the reactionary bourgeois line. Under the appeal of Mao Zedong Thought and the patient help and education of the "August 18" revolutionary factions, the deceived masses awakened one after another, voluntarily dissolved the conservative organizations, and many comrades joined the "August 18" revolutionary mass organizations. We were able to, in such a short time, make the conservative organizations collapse, and the broad deceived masses counterattacked, exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders led by Wang Zhao within the old Provincial Party Committee; the "August 18" revolutionary factions, in the struggle, firmly acted according to the party's policy, without incidents of retaliation, and without major armed clashes. This is the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, the effect of the party's policy.

In dealing with cadre issues, we, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, firmly executed Chairman Mao's cadre line, "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres." In identifying cadres, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Not only should we look at a cadre's one-time one-event, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Some units thought that the standard for identifying cadres was not easy to grasp, and for the same cadre, some said he was revolutionary, and some said he was not revolutionary. Why? The key is that they did not stand on the standpoint of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, using Chairman Mao's cadre policy to look at cadres, but looked at cadres from their personal angle and personal viewpoint, so they could not unify, and even might hold onto revolutionary leading cadres, making it impossible to unite the cadres who should be united. The experience of many units proved: Only with Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly identify revolutionary cadres and help cadres who made mistakes to stand up. We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, dared to insist on Chairman Mao's cadre line, firmly executed Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and practiced "liberating a large area and striking down a small handful." For revolutionary cadres, we dared to support and protect them, fearing no one saying we were rightist, conservative, or royalist. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Party, we firmly struck them down, removed their positions, and seized their power, not allowing them to sneak into our revolutionary ranks. Precisely because we, the "August 18," were good at distinguishing whether cadres were of which headquarters, which road they walked, and whether they could return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, many revolutionary leading cadres stood up, forming the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We seized the power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee. This is only the beginning. We will use the experience of seizing power with Mao Zedong Thought in the province to advance victoriously, seizing back all the power usurped by the capitalist-roaders within the party throughout the province, making all the power in the province truly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions.

Comrades and fellow fighters of the revolution! We have all fought together, together we have defeated the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee, smashed the counterrevolutionary restoration tide, achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," established the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and created today's great situation. All these victories are the victories of great Mao Zedong Thought and the victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon of our revolutionary victory, the magic weapon of our victory over the enemy, and the magic weapon of our overcoming any difficulties. This is proven by the decades of struggle of our party, and we have proven it in the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. We must forever, generation after generation, grasp the magic weapon of Mao Zedong Thought.

Seizing power must be with Mao Zedong Thought

We must realize that we not only need to be good at seizing power but also need to be good at holding and using power, further consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

We have seized power, but the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not ended. The main contradiction is still the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the broad revolutionary masses and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The fundamental task of our revolutionary committee is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Qinghai, and in the great criticism and struggle, consolidate and develop the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party hate and fear the revolutionary factions seizing great power, and every moment they are scheming to overthrow the proletarian power we hold, hoping to restore their lost "paradise." Their struggle against us will be more concealed, more cunning, and more vicious. The most insidious and important means is to corrupt and infiltrate us, the proletarian revolutionary factions, especially the members of the revolutionary committee, politically, ideologically, and in daily life, practicing "peaceful evolution." We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "There may be some communists who have never been defeated by the enemy with guns, who are heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets." Some comrades in our revolutionary faction may have bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in their minds, which may grow and develop with the change of status, easily hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy, so we must be a hundred times vigilant against the attack of the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy.

We, the proletarian revolutionary factions, must be highly vigilant and never think that seizing power means the world is peaceful, forgetting class struggle, forgetting the direction of struggle. Qinghai Province, since its liberation in 1949, has established the proletarian dictatorship, but the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has never stopped. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee usurped our leadership, attempting to lead the proletarian dictatorship to the road of capitalist restoration. This serious lesson, we, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, and all the people of Qinghai must forever firmly remember.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: No matter how complicated the affairs are, we must never forget the power. Forgetting the power is forgetting the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism. That is a fool, and his head is off before he knows how it happened.

After the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, there are indeed many affairs to attend to. We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, never forget the power, never forget to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and must use Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power. The decades of struggle of our party, the struggle of the cultural revolution, and the struggle of the international communist movement, all prove a truth: Using Mao Zedong Thought to hold power can strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship; using bourgeois thought to hold power will degenerate into bourgeois dictatorship. That is: Using "public" to seize power is to faithfully execute Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power can strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. Using "private" to seize power is to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, using bourgeois thought to hold and use power will degenerate into bourgeois dictatorship.

We must make the power seized by the proletarian revolutionary factions forever retain its red color. The most fundamental thing is to hold power well and use power well with Mao Zedong Thought. That is to listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. This direction is to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, more fully, more deeply, and more comprehensively expose and criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Qinghai, promote and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, politically, ideologically, and theoretically thoroughly criticize, expose, and denounce the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Only by grasping this direction can we eliminate the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism; only by grasping this direction can we thoroughly criticize bourgeois thought and establish Mao Zedong Thought; only by grasping this direction can we unite all the people of Qinghai and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. In short, say a thousand words, say ten thousand words, it is to grasp the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and not let go. Whoever relaxes this point will lose direction and will make directional errors. Some comrades think that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee have been exposed and are "dead tigers," with nothing to fight against, and can relax. We say: The "tiger" is lying down but not dead. It is not that there is nothing to fight against, not that one can relax, but to beat the drum tightly and with one breath, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by imitating the King of Chu," with the "August 18" revolutionary factions as the core, organizing all the people of Qinghai into a vast, united, and united fighting army against the enemy, launching a magnificent and irresistible struggle and criticism movement. In the struggle, we will study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible sharp weapon, to criticize, expose, and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Provincial Party Committee. On the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts, we will thoroughly eliminate the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line, thoroughly complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield in Qinghai Province.

Within the proletarian revolutionary factions, there are different views on some issues, which is a normal phenomenon. In the revolutionary mass movement, with so many people, it is impossible to have the same view on every issue. We, under the premise of uniting to fight against the enemy, allow different views, welcome the proposal of different opinions, and allow the preservation of opinions that cannot be unified at the moment. We can unify them in the struggle with Mao Zedong Thought. However, although there are various opinions and different views, we should see that they are contradictions within the people, and we must not turn the gun that should be aimed at the enemy to our comrades, shifting the direction of the struggle.

Comrades and fellow fighters of the revolution! Our struggle for power has paid a price, and we must never forget the past, never forget the cruel persecution of the class enemy. We must turn our class hatred, blood, and tears into a thousandfold strength, fiercely striking down the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the class enemy. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bravely fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Party in the great counterattack of the reactionary bourgeois line, forever maintaining this spirit. If some of our comrades forget the class enemy, take the differences and opinions within the revolutionary factions too seriously, and even develop into "internal war," it will make our comrades who have fought together feel heartbroken and make the class enemy happy. That would be disloyal to the care and support given to us, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, by our great leader Chairman Mao.

We, the "August 18" revolutionary factions, and all the people of Qinghai must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to hold power well and use power well, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, firmly resist the sugar-coated bullets of the enemy, firmly prevent petty-bourgeois thought from interfering with our power from the right or "left" side, weakening the proletarian dictatorship. We must be good at guiding petty-bourgeois thought to the track of proletarian thought, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. Every comrade of the revolutionary factions has the right to supervise and help our power, to support our power, to cherish our power, and the purpose is to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, not to weaken the proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao's instruction of "frugality for revolution" not only has great economic significance but also has great political significance, and we must firmly carry it out. Especially after we seize power, with financial power in our hands, we must be even more thrifty. A pen, a piece of paper, a wire, a grain of rice, all must be thrifty, this is the character of the proletariat. Wastefulness is the style of the bourgeoisie, and we must firmly oppose it.

We must also actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production." Factories, rural areas, and pastoral areas must actively grasp revolution and promote production, striving to complete or overfulfill production plans; offices must grasp revolution and promote work, making their duties better; schools must learn from Beijing Aviation College, resume classes and make revolution; the army must grasp revolution, promote preparedness, and promote work. Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, issued a great call to the People's Liberation Army: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new merits in the proletarian cultural revolution movement." This is the greatest care, greatest trust, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur to the People's Liberation Army. Currently, the Qinghai Military Region and the Qinghai garrison face the combat task of responding to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call, continuing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing with the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary factions, fighting shoulder to shoulder, achieving new merits for the people in the proletarian cultural revolution, firmly completing the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries," and being ready to strike any enemy who dares to invade. In short, we must both build spiritually and materially, and use spiritual building to promote material building. Like a locomotive pulling a train on double tracks, it will advance a thousand miles a day.

The revolutionary committee must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought

To consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, the key is that the members of the revolutionary committee must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, faithfully execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the party's policies and guidelines in everything.

Our power must be in the hands of those who hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Today, Chairman Mao trusts us, the people trust us, and the great power of the entire province is handed over to us, the proletarian revolutionary factions. We, the comrades of the revolutionary committee, whether in ideology or work ability, are far from the requirements of Chairman Mao and the people for us. The fundamental solution to this problem is to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, making us understand Chairman Mao's instructions more and deeper, follow more closely. In this way, our wisdom will be greater, our abilities will be greater, we will make fewer mistakes, and even if we make mistakes, we can correct them faster.

Currently, a major problem facing us is the issue of for whom to hold power. Is it to hold power for the proletariat, for the people, for the public, and faithfully execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, walking the socialist road, or is it to hold power for small groups, for the private, and for personal interests? This is the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. In this struggle, we must consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to fight, thoroughly sweep away bourgeois thought from our minds, hold power for the public, hold power for the proletariat, hold power for the people, and hold power for socialism. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Wholeheartedly serve the people, never leave the masses; act from the interests of the people, not from personal or small group interests; the consistency of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the party's leading organs; these are our starting points." If we hold power for the private, allowing the private to cause trouble in our minds, it will lead to degeneration and produce revisionism.

We, the comrades of the revolutionary committee, whether older or younger, must solidly transform our worldview, transforming both the objective world and the subjective world. We must complete the heavy responsibility entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and all the people of Qinghai, higher hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unshakably execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and build Qinghai into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

1. We must definitely use Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolution, and we must not allow non-proletarian thought to lead the revolution. Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest genius. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times, and the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level, the highest in prestige, the greatest in power, every word is the truth, and one word is worth ten thousand words. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, treat the "Three Articles" as our motto, study and apply, using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome non-proletarian thought in our minds. Chairman Mao's instructions, we must firmly execute and firmly act upon. We cannot use old experience and old level to replace Chairman Mao's thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work and use Mao Zedong Thought to measure our work. All our words and deeds must be based on Mao Zedong Thought. If we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, we will inevitably make big mistakes. Chairman Mao's instructions, we must firmly execute whether we understand them or not. We must execute them well, and we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "The situation is constantly changing, and to make our thoughts adapt to the new situation, we must learn." If we do not pay attention to this issue, overestimate ourselves, fall into subjectivity, and do not execute things that do not meet our wishes, even proposing our own "small hill" to resist, allowing it to develop, from small to big, from quantitative change to qualitative change, it may lead to the danger of opposing Mao Zedong Thought, making directional errors. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party exposed in this cultural revolution, their thousands of crimes, tens of thousands of crimes, the most fundamental crime is opposing Mao Zedong Thought. We must always sound the alarm for ourselves, absolutely not deviating from the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

2. We must definitely firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and absolutely not allow the establishment of personal authority. Firmly establishing the authority of Mao Zedong Thought is the top priority of the revolution, the top priority of whether the country changes color, and the top priority related to the world revolution. Every member of the revolutionary committee, in firmly establishing the authority of Mao Zedong Thought, must set an example and do it well. If we calculate personally, seek personal authority, seek fame, seek profit, seek power, seek position, seek to stand out, forget the whole, forget the seven hundred million people, forget the three billion people in the world, it is very dangerous. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If it cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot be finally liberated." We must have a broad mind for the country and look at the world, and we must have the ambition and determination to plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. Those who calculate personally cannot faithfully execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, cannot be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and cannot act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. All thoughts and styles that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must be firmly resisted and opposed. Words that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must not be said; things that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must not be done. We, the comrades of the revolutionary committee, must consciously transform our thoughts, continuously improve our level of Mao Zedong Thought, and in everything, use Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

3. We must definitely stand among the masses and absolutely not stand above the masses. Our great leader Chairman Mao cares most about the masses, trusts the masses the most, and is best at walking the mass line, setting a brilliant example for us. We, the young comrades of the revolutionary committee, grew up in the mass movement, sharing the same breath and fate with the masses; the old comrades also have deep feelings with the masses. However, after we seize power, our status has changed, and how to maintain the character of an ordinary old hundred is a major political issue. We must care about national affairs, care about the interests of the people, care about the interests of the revolution, and in everything, think what the "August 18" revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses think, do what the "August 18" revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses do, and be concerned about what the "August 18" revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses are concerned about. We must always think about the revolution, act for the revolution, and serve the people for life. We must forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people, and everything we do is for the people to serve." We only have the duty to serve the people and do not have the right to be above the people. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be both an 'official' and an ordinary person." We must: (1) Correctly understand the role of the individual and the role of the masses. The proletarian cultural revolution is a mass movement of hundreds of millions of people, which cannot be completed by a few people, let alone by one person. Chairman Mao said: "The people, only the people, are the creators of world history." The ability of an individual is always limited, and each of us is only contributing our own share to the revolution, and we must not overestimate our role, and we must not use what we have done as capital to show off our superiority. If we do that, we will put ourselves in an inappropriate position. (2) In dealing with comrades, we must be good at learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses. We must see more of others' strengths and make up for our own weaknesses. Each revolutionary has strengths and weaknesses. You may have strengths in one aspect but weaknesses in another. Strengths and weaknesses are also not static. Each comrade should learn from others' strengths and make up for their own weaknesses, and even if you have many strengths, you should not be arrogant, and it is not worth being arrogant. If you only see your own strengths and do not see others' strengths, where can you talk about learning from the masses and being a small student of the masses? Chairman Mao taught us: "The masses are the true heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable, and not understanding this, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." (3) Correctly understand one's own advantages and disadvantages. Each of us is a unity of two opposites, having both advantages and disadvantages. If we only see advantages, we will be arrogant, will deviate from the masses, and will not be able to continue to advance. For each of us, especially when the revolution achieves certain victories, we must see our own disadvantages and mistakes. We must follow Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions, both treating ourselves as a force of the revolution and constantly treating ourselves as an object of the revolution. Here, we must first treat ourselves as an object of the revolution, reforming the private character in our minds, constantly sweeping away the private character in our minds, overcoming the disadvantages and mistakes in our work, and only then can we continue to advance and revolutionize. If we only reform others and do not reform ourselves, the revolution will not be good.

Comrades and fellow fighters of the revolution! As we celebrate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, reviewing the past and looking to the future, we increasingly deeply feel: Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting proletarian politics, and firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end and completing all tasks, and the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. We believe that the "August 18" revolutionary factions and all the revolutionary people of Qinghai, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, will definitely plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the top of Kunlun Mountain, plant it in every factory, every commune, every store, every school, every office, every street, and every inch of land in the province, making the Qinghai Plateau forever shine with the light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Let us shout:

Highly hold the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their black hands stretching into Qinghai!

Thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters!

Long live the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Long live the proletarian dictatorship!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!

    大立毛泽东思想  把青海建设成为毛泽东思想的阵地
    青海省革命委员会主任刘贤权在省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上的讲话
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，人民解放军指战员同志们，红卫兵小将们，战友们：
    青海省革命委员会，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导和亲切关怀下，在中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组的直接领导下，今天正式成立了！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，这是中共中央关于青海问题决定的伟大胜利，这是我国无产阶级文化大革命又一支响彻云霄的凯歌！
    在这全省各族人民最盛大的节日里，我们衷心祝愿我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    中国人民解放军青海军区和驻青海各部队广大指战员，遵循毛主席的教导，坚决地大力地支持“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派，对青海地区无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大贡献，建立了新的功勋，我们向他们致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    在我省无产阶级文化大革命的进程中，首都和全国各地来青海串连的红卫兵小将，同我们并肩战斗，同呼吸、共命运，给我们很大的支持和鼓舞，我们向他们致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    夺权靠的是毛泽东思想
    今天，在我们庆祝青海省革命委员会成立，庆祝无产阶级文化大革命胜利的时候，让我们正确认识文化大革命一年多来，怎样战胜重重困难，克服种种阻力，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中，夺回党、政、财、文大权，是具有重大意义的。
    一年前，党的八届十一中全会，进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，确立了一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最忠诚、最坚决、最彻底执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的林彪同志为全党的副统帅，进一步巩固了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，击败了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部。毛主席亲自主持制定的全会的文件，进一步系统地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，向全国人民指明了巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的光辉道路。在具有伟大划时代意义的党的八届十一中全会上，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报。
    毛主席的大字报说：“全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读一遍这张大字报和这个评论。可是在五十多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”毛主席的这张大字报，是又一声开辟人类历史新纪元的伟大“号炮”，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命，取得决定胜利的一炮，是摧毁隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部的一炮，是保证我们党和国家千秋万代永不变色的一炮。从而，使全党全国人民进一步明白了这一场无产阶级文化大革命的主要对象和主要任务。
    一年来，我们“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派在和阶级敌人的生死搏斗中，紧跟我们伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟战无不胜的毛泽东思想，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。我们的每一个胜利，是党的八届十一中全会的伟大成果，是“十六条”的伟大成果，是毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    是毛主席点燃了青海文化大革命的熊熊烈火，是毛泽东思想的照妖镜和显微镜，使我们揪出了旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这些资产阶级代表人物，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派伸向青海的黑手，安在青海的钉子，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图通过这些家伙把青海变成复辟资本主义的一个基地。长期以来，这些家伙秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，恶毒地污蔑我们的伟大领袖毛主席，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，对抗毛主席的革命路线，抵制学习毛主席著作。他们肉麻地吹捧中国的赫鲁晓夫，忠实地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线。在四清运动中搞形“左”实右，在农牧区推行“三自一包”，在民族统战问题上实行投降主义路线，在教育、文艺上推行修正主义路线。在干部问题上，结党营私，招降纳叛，打击大批革命干部，包庇重用坏人，篡夺党政财文大权，实行资产阶级专政。他们狂妄叫嚣“党重新建设，政权重新组织，干部重新认识。”全面推行中国赫鲁晓夫的一套修正主义纲领、路线、方针、政策，在政治、经济、文化思想等各个领域里，向无产阶级发动了猖狂进攻，大搞资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。在伟大的文化大革命运动中，他们又顽固地充当中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线的急先锋，玩弄阴谋诡计，实行白色恐怖，镇压革命群众运动。
    我们“八·一八”等革命派，天不怕，地不怕，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，向着青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，向着资产阶级反动路线奋勇冲杀。当阶级敌人眼看自己即将完蛋的时候，来了个狗急跳墙，制造了骇人听闻的资产阶级反动路线新反扑。我们“八·一八”等革命派，在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，怀着誓死保卫毛主席、誓死保卫毛泽东思想、誓死保卫毛主席革命路线的坚强信念，和阶级敌人展开了英勇的搏斗。“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”在白色恐怖的日子里，不管阶级敌人如何摧残，我们都是一心向着毛主席，一心向着党。有的同志在遭到摧残的时候，一不叫苦，二不喊痛，只要把身边心爱的伟大领袖毛主席像拿出来看一看，就精神振奋，力量无穷。同志们，亲爱的“八·一八”等革命派的战友们，这是什么样的力量？这是什么样的精神？是伟大的毛泽东思想给予我们的力量，是无产阶级的革命精神。我们要向那些坚决保卫毛主席，坚决保卫毛泽东思想，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的同志学习；向那些在敌人镇压下，坚决向资产阶级反动路线作斗争的同志学习。无产阶级革命派都要象他们那样忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策下，在人民解放军驻青海各部队的大力支持下，在“八·一八”等革命派的英勇斗争下，彻底粉碎了反革命复辟逆流，光芒万丈的毛泽东思想照亮了青海高原，拯救了青海的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们“八·一八”等革命派沿着毛主席指引的航向，经过革命的大批判、大斗争，在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”。
    青海地区的保守组织，在旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的操纵下，在政治上受了害，中了毒，打击了“八·一八”等革命派，破坏了阶级兄弟的感情。保守组织中的个别坏人，甚至是阶级敌人，对我们“八·一八”等革命派进行过残酷迫害。在这种情况下，如何争取、教育、团结广大受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，是一个非常艰巨复杂的问题。我们“八·一八”等革命派，在解放军支左部队的支持和帮助下，坚决听毛主席的话，正确区分了两类不同性质的矛盾，分清走资本主义道路当权派和受蒙蔽群众的界限；分清受蒙蔽群众作坏事和坏人做坏事的界限。对走资本主义道路当权派，坚决打倒；对个别反坏分子，坚决镇压。广大受蒙蔽的群众，即便作了这样那样的错事，他们是无罪的，是我们的阶级兄弟。我们团结他们，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，共同向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和反坏分子开火，防止和克服了要搞“红色恐怖”，“只有触及皮肉，才能触及灵魂”的错误倾向和错误做法。我们紧紧掌握了斗争大方向，对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，进行深入的大揭发、大控诉、大批判、大斗争，在斗争中教育群众，提高受蒙蔽群众的觉悟，使他们和资产阶级反动路线划清界限。在毛泽东思想的感召下，在
  “八·一八”等革命派的耐心帮助教育下，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉悟，自动解散保守组织，许多同志加入了“八·一八”等革命群众组织。我们能够在这样短的时间，使保守组织土崩瓦解，广大受蒙蔽的群众大杀回马枪，揭发旧省委内以王昭为首的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；“八·一八”等革命派在斗争中坚决按照党的政策办事，没有发生打击报复现象，没有发生大的武斗，这是毛泽东思想的巨大威力，这是党的政策的作用。
    在对待干部问题上，我们“八·一八”等革命派坚定执行毛主席的干部路线，“相信和依靠干部的大多数”。在识别干部的时候，遵循毛主席的教导：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”有的单位认为识别干部标准不好掌握，对于同一个干部，有的说是革命的，有的说是不革命的。原因何在？关键在于没有站到毛主席的革命路线的立场，用毛主席的干部政策看干部，而是从个人的角度、个人的观点去看干部，所以就统一不了，甚至可能把革命的领导干部揪住不放，使应该结合的干部不能结合起来。许多单位的经验证明：只有用毛泽东思想，才能正确地识别革命干部，才能帮助犯错误的干部站出来。我们“八·一八”等革命派敢于坚持毛主席的干部路线，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，实行“解放一大片，打击一小撮”。对待革命的干部，敢于支持，敢于保护，不怕别人说“右”倾、“保守”、“保皇”。对青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则坚决打倒，罢他们的官，夺他们的权，决不允许钻进我们革命队伍里。正因为我们“八·一八”善于区别干部是那个司令部的人，是走什么样的道路，能不能回到毛主席的革命路线上来，从而使许多革命领导干部站出来了，组成了革命的“三结合”。我们夺了旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，这仅仅是开始，我们要运用省里用毛泽东思想夺权的经验乘胜前进，将全省一切被党内走资本主义道路的当权派窃踞的权力，统统夺回来，使全省一切权力都真正掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手中。
    革命同志们，战友们！我们都是在一起战斗的，我们在一起打垮了旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，粉碎了反革命复辟逆流，实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，成立了省革命委员会，出现今天这样的大好形势。这一切胜利都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。伟大的毛泽东思想是我们革命胜利的法宝，是我们战胜敌人的法宝，是我们克服任何困难的法宝。这是我们党几十年的斗争证明了的，我们亲身在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中证明了的。我们要永远永远、世世代代掌握毛泽东思想这个法宝。
    掌权必须用毛泽东思想
    我们必须认识到，不仅要善于夺权，而且要善于掌权和用权，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    我们夺了权，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。主要矛盾，仍然是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是广大革命人民同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。我们革命委员会的根本任务，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人，在大批判、大斗争中巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固无产阶级专政。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对革命派掌握大权恨得要命，怕得要死，每时每刻都在挖空心思地要搞垮我们无产阶级所掌握的政权，妄想恢复他们失去的“天堂”。他们同我们斗争的手段将会更加隐蔽，更加狡猾，更加毒辣。最阴险最重要的手段就是对我们无产阶级革命派，特别是革命委员会的成员，从政治上、思想上、生活上进行腐蚀侵袭，搞“和平演变”。我们要切记毛主席的教导：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”我们革命派队伍中，有些同志头脑中的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，可能随着地位的变化而滋长和发展，很容易被阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹打中，因而要百倍警惕阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹的攻击。
    我们无产阶级革命派必须高度警惕，千万不要以为夺了权，就天下太平了，忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了掌握斗争的大方向。我们青海省从一九四九年解放，就建立了无产阶级专政的政权，但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，始终未停止。旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，篡夺了我们的领导权，妄图把无产阶级专政引向资本主义复辟的道路。这一严重教训，我们“八·一八”等革命派和全省各族人民，要永远牢牢记住。
    林彪同志指示我们：无论怎样千头万绪的事，永远不要忘记政权。忘记了政权，就是忘记了马克思主义的根本观点。那就是糊涂人，脑袋掉了，还不知道怎么掉的。
    省革命委员会建立后，确有千头万绪的事，我们必须遵照林彪同志的指示，决不能忘记政权，决不能忘记巩固无产阶级专政，一定要用毛泽东思想掌权，用毛泽东思想用权。我们党几十年的斗争，文化大革命的斗争，国际共产主义运动的斗争，一切一切，都证明一个真理：用毛泽东思想掌权，就能加强和巩固无产阶级专政；用资产阶级思想掌权，就会蜕化成为资产阶级专政。也就是：用“公”字夺权，就是忠实地执行毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想掌权、用权，就能加强无产阶级专政。用“私”字夺权，就是反对毛泽东思想，用资产阶级思想掌权、用权，就会蜕化成资产阶级专政。
    我们要使无产阶级革命派夺过来的政权永远保持鲜红的颜色，最最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想来掌好权、用好权。就是要听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。这个大方向就是高举革命的批判旗帜，更充分、更深入、更全面地揭露和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在青海的代理人，推动和完成本单位的斗、批、改任务，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批透、批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。只有抓住这个大方向，才能肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子；只有抓住这个大方向，才能大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想；只有抓住这个大方向，才能团结全省各族人民，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。总之，说一千句，道一万句，就是要抓住党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不放。谁要放松这一点，谁就会迷失方向，就要犯方向错误。有的同志认为，旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了，是“死老虎”了，没有什么斗头了，可松一口气了。我们说：“老虎”躺是躺下了，但还没有死。不是没有斗头，不是可以松口气，而是要密锣紧鼓，一鼓作气，遵循毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，以“八·一八”等革命派为核心，把全省各族人民组成一支浩浩荡荡的、团结一心共同对敌的战斗大军，展开一场气势磅礴，锐不可挡的大斗争、大批判运动。在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的锐利武器，把旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批透、批臭。在政治、经济、思想、文化各条战线上，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，彻底完成斗、批、改的任务，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全青海省各个阵地。
    我们无产阶级革命派内部，对于某些问题有不同的看法，是完全正常的现象。在革命的群众运动中，那么多的人，什么问题都要求一个看法是不可能的。我们在联合起来共同对敌的大前提下，允许有不同看法，欢迎提出不同的意见，对运动、对问题提出这样那样的不同意见，是关心运动，关心革命的表现。有些意见一时统一不起来，也是允许保留的。我们可以在斗争中用毛泽东思想统一起来。但是，尽管有这样那样的意见和不同的看法，都应该看到是人民内部的矛盾，决不能把对准敌人的枪口掉过来对准同志，转移斗争的大方向。
    革命同志们，战友们！我们的夺权斗争是付出了代价的，我们千万不要忘记过去，千万不要忘记阶级敌人对我们的残酷迫害。我们要把阶级仇、血泪恨，凝成千百倍的力量，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和阶级敌人，我们要发扬在资产阶级反动路线大反扑中向青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派英勇斗争的革命精神，永远保持这种精神。如果我们有的同志，忘记了阶级敌人，把革命派内部的某些认识上的分歧和意见看得过重，硬把问题往纲上提，甚至发展成“内战”，那就会使我们一起战斗的同志痛心，使阶级敌人高兴。那就对不起我们伟大领袖毛主席给予我们“八·一八”等革命派的关怀和支持。
    我们“八·一八”等革命派和全省各族人民，一定要用伟大的毛泽东思想来掌好权、用好权，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，坚决打退敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻；坚决防止小资产阶级思想，从右的或“左”的方面来干扰我们的政权，削弱无产阶级专政。要善于把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级思想即毛泽东思想的轨道。我们每一个革命派的同志有权监督和帮助我们的政权，要拥护我们的政权，爱护我们的政权，其目的就是为了巩固无产阶级专政，而决不是削弱无产阶级专政。
    毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，不仅有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义，我们必须坚决贯彻执行。特别是我们掌权以后，手里有了财权，更要精打细算。一枝笔，一张纸，一根铁丝，一粒粮食，都要注意节约，这是我们无产阶级的本色。铺张浪费，是资产阶级作风，我们必须坚决反对。
    我们还要积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。工厂、农村、牧区要积极抓革命、促生产，力争完成或超额完成生产计划；机关要抓革命、促工作，把本职工作搞得更好；学校要向北京航空学院学习，复课闹革命；军队要抓革命，促战备，促工作。我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，向人民解放军发出了伟大的号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”。这是对人民解放军最大的关怀，最大的信赖，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。当前，青海省军区和青海驻军面临的战斗任务，就是响应林彪副主席的伟大号召，继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧地和“八·一八”无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功，坚决完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，随时准备打击任何敢于侵犯的敌人。总之，我们既要搞精神建设，又要搞物质建设，并且要用精神建设来推动物质建设。如同总的火车头带动火车在双轨道上前进，就会一日千里。
    革命委员会一定要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    要巩固无产阶级专政，关键在于革命委员会成员头脑里，要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，忠实地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，处处按毛主席指示和党的方针政策办事。
    我们的政权，必须是掌握在高举毛泽东思想红旗的人手上。今天，毛主席信任我们，人民信任我们，把全省的大权交给了我们无产阶级革命派。我们革命委员会的同志，无论在思想上、工作能力上，距离毛主席和人民对我们的要求都是很远的。解决这个问题的根本办法，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想改造我们的世界观，使我们对毛主席的指示理解得多一点，深一点，跟得紧一点。这样，我们的智慧就会多一些，本事就会大一些，错误就可以少犯一些，犯了错误也可以改正得快一些。
    当前摆在我们面前一个重大问题，就是为谁掌权的问题。是为无产阶级掌权，为人民掌权，为“公”掌权，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，走社会主义道路，还是为小团体掌权，为“私”掌权。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。在这个斗争中，我们要自觉用毛泽东思想去战斗，彻底扫除头脑里的资产阶级思想，为“公”掌权，为无产阶级掌权，为人民掌权，为社会主义掌权。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”如果为“私”掌权，任“私”字在头脑里兴风作浪，就会引起蜕化变质，出修正主义。
    我们革命委员会的同志，不管是比较老的还是年青的，都必须扎扎实实地改造世界观，既要改造客观世界，又要改造主观世界。我们一定要完成毛主席和全省各族人民给予的重托，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大立毛泽东思想，把青海建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一、一定要用毛泽东思想领导革命，决不允许用非无产阶级思想领导革命。毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，要把“老三篇”当作“座右铭”来学，学了就用，用毛泽东思想克服我们头脑里的非无产阶级思想。毛主席的指示，我们要坚决执行，坚决照办，我们不能凭过去的老经验、老水平，以想当然来代替毛主席的思想。我们要以毛泽东思想指引工作，以毛泽东思想衡量工作。我们的一切言论和行动，都必须以毛泽东思想为准则，离开了毛泽东思想，那就非犯大错误不可。毛主席的指示，我们理解的要坚决执行，不理解的也要坚决执行。我们要执行得好些，就得遵照毛主席教导：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”如果我们不注意这个问题，过分相信自己，陷入盲目性，不符合自己愿望的事就不执行，甚至提出自己的“小山头”来对抗，任其发展下去，由小变大，由量变到质变，就有可能走向反毛泽东思想的危险地步，犯路线方向的错误。这次文化大革命中揪出来的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们千条罪、万条罪，最根本的一条罪，就是反对毛泽东思想。我们要时刻给自己敲敲警钟，绝不能脱离毛泽东思想的轨道。
    二、一定要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，决不允许立个人权威。大立毛泽东思想的权威，这是革命的头等大事，是国家变不变颜色的头等大事，也是关系到世界革命的头等大事。我们革命委员会每个成员，在大立毛泽东思想权威上，要以身作则，做好样子。如果打个人小算盘，搞个人的权威，争名、争利、争权、争位、争出风头，忘了整体，忘了七亿人民，忘了三十亿世界人民，那是非常危险的。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”要胸怀祖国，眼望世界，要树立把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界的雄心壮志。打小算盘的人，就不可能忠实执行毛主席的革命路线，就不可能忠于毛泽东思想，就不可能听毛主席的话按毛主席的指示办事。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的思想作风，要坚决抵制，坚决反对。不符合毛泽东思想的话，就不说；不符合毛泽东思想的事，就不做。我们革命委员会的同志要自觉地改造思想，不断提高自己的毛泽东思想水平，处处事事以毛泽东思想为指针，大立特立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    三、一定要站在群众之中，决不允许站在群众之上。我们伟大领袖毛主席最关心群众，最信任群众，最善于走群众路线，给我们树立了光辉的榜样。我们革命委员会年青的同志是在群众运动中成长起来的，与群众同呼吸共命运；老同志与群众也都有较深的感情。但是，我们掌权后，地位发生变化了，如何保持普通老百姓的本色是一个重大的政治问题。我们要关心国家大事，关心人民的利益，关心革命的利益，要处处想“八·一八”等革命派和广大革命群众所想，作“八·一八”等革命派和广大革命群众所作，急“八·一八”等革命派和广大革命群众所急，要时时想到革命，事事为革命，终身为人民服务。我们要永远永远记住毛主席教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。我们只有为人民服务的义务，没有高居人民之上的权利。要牢记毛主席教导：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。我们要：（1）正确地认识个人的作用和群众的作用。无产阶级文化大革命是亿万人民的群众运动，决不是少数人能完成的，更不是那个人包打的天下。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”一个人的能力总是有限的，我们每个人只是为革命尽到自己应尽的一分力量，切不可把自己的作用估计过高，更不能把自己作的事当作资本，显示自己高明。要是那样，就把自己摆到不适当的地位了。（2）对待同志的态度，要善于取长补短。多看到别人的长处，补自己的短处。我们每一个革命者都有长处，都有短处。你在这一方面有长处，在另一方面可能有短处。长处和短处也都不是静止不变的。每个同志应该学习别人的长处，弥补自己的短处，就是你的长处多，也不应该骄傲，也不值得骄傲。如果光看自己的长处，不看别人的长处，那里还谈得上向群众学习，作群众的小学生呢？毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”（3）正确对待自己的优点和缺点。我们每个同志都是一分为二的，既有优点，又有缺点。如果只看优点，就会骄傲，就会脱离群众，就不能继续前进。对我们每个人来说，特别是在革命取得一定胜利的时候，一定要看到自己的缺点和错误。我们要遵照林彪副主席的指示，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。这里首先要把自己当作革命的对象，革自己头脑里私字的命，经常扫除自己头脑中的“私”字，克服工作中的缺点和错误，才能继续前进，不断革命。如果只革别人的命，不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。
    革命的同志们，战友们！在我们欢庆成立青海省革命委员会的时候，回顾过去，展望未来，我们越来越深刻地体会到：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，大立毛泽东思想，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底和完成一切任务的根本保证，是巩固无产阶级专政的根本保证。我们相信忠于毛主席的“八·一八”等革命派和全省各族革命人民，一定会把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，插上昆仑山顶，插遍全省的每一个工厂，每一个公社，每一个商店，每一个学校，每一个机关，每一条街道，每一寸土地，使青海高原永远闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    让我们高呼：
    高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其伸向青海的黑手！
    彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    光焰无际、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
