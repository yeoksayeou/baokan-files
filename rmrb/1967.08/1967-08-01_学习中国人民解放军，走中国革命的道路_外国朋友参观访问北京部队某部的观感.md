The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism that has been proven by history and is universally applicable.

What kind of people's armed forces should be established? After establishing the people's armed forces, what path of struggle should be taken? In search of such revolutionary truths and experiences, revolutionary people from all over the world have traveled thousands of miles to the center of the world revolution—China—to visit and tour the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. They regard such visits and tours as "the most unforgettable day" and "the most educational and inspiring visit." Many foreign guests, after their visits and tours, confidently said: "As long as we follow the path of the Chinese people, victory will surely be ours." They enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the People's Liberation Army! Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

To make a revolution, one must build an army like China's, an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people wholeheartedly, and completely new-type proletarian revolutionary army.

After entering the military camp, foreign friends first saw that Mao's colorful portraits and quotations were hung everywhere. Their first activity was to participate in the "experience-sharing meeting" where officers and soldiers study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Throughout the visit and tour, the broad masses of officers and soldiers read Chairman Mao's books every day, listened to Chairman Mao's words, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and resolved to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Their determination, as well as their unlimited faith, loyalty, love, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, left a deep impression on foreign friends. After the visit and tour, they deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army is a completely new-type proletarian revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the most advanced thoughts and the most unified actions.

On May 22 of this year, the Japanese Journalists' Alliance delegation came to this unit to participate in the officers and soldiers' "experience-sharing meeting" on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They unanimously praised: "The People's Liberation Army's study and application of Chairman Mao's works is excellent," and "the 'experience-sharing meeting' is the best learning method." Member Kakuya Eii was moved to say: "In the past, we studied Marxism-Leninism, and they (referring to Japanese revisionists) emphasized systematic learning. We studied for many years but only understood some Marxist-Leninist terms, which were not connected with revolutionary practice. Today, after listening to the introduction of three PLA soldiers on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, we know that we should learn like them. Only by learning like that can we transform ourselves and guide the revolution."

They visited the company to see the soldiers' dormitories and saw that the soldiers had written their ideological problems on their beds and chosen Chairman Mao's quotations to address these problems, which made them all excited. The leader Kobayashi Yuichi asked the soldiers: "Is this done by every soldier in the entire unit?" When they received an affirmative answer, they sighed with admiration: "Every soldier learns like this, which is truly remarkable."

New Zealand Communist Party comrade Casey, after visiting and listening to the "experience-sharing meeting," said: "I learned a lot from the PLA soldiers." Many foreign guests said excitedly after the visit: "Through this visit and tour, our most prominent feeling is that 'Mao Zedong Thought has become the blood and flesh of every officer and every soldier.'"

Many officers and soldiers of the unit visited by foreign friends actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, participated in the "three supports and two militaries" work, and firmly supported the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Their vivid deeds made foreign friends very excited. At the same time, in addition to carrying out agricultural and sideline production, this unit also integrated with the local masses, providing continuous political, ideological, manpower, and material support. All this also moved foreign friends very much. They unanimously praised: "The People's Liberation Army is a completely new-type army that serves the people wholeheartedly."

Many revolutionaries fighting for national liberation, after visiting this unit, excitedly expressed that they would strive to build a people's armed force like the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people wholeheartedly, and completely new-type, after returning to their countries. A friend from South Africa said: "Through the visit, I have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is an unshakable great truth. The white colonialists can suppress us because they have guns while we do not. To liberate our country, we must also build a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Southeast Asia said: "Only by building a revolutionary army like the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and serving the people, can we defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys and achieve the thorough liberation of the nation and the people."

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." After listening to the glorious history of this unit and the heroic deeds of the soldiers who fought against the Kuomintang bandits and the American imperialist aggressors, foreign friends, in connection with the experiences and lessons of revolutionary struggles in their own countries and the world, deeply realized that to achieve national and ethnic liberation, one must follow Mao Zedong's path, the path of the Chinese revolution, the path of armed struggle. This is the only path to revolutionary victory.

Indonesian friend Shalam had deep feelings and said: "Tens of thousands of Communist Party members and revolutionaries in my country were killed by the reactionary government. Why? The main reason is that we deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary path, forgot to seize political power by armed force, accepted the theory of 'peaceful transition' and 'parliamentary struggle' from the Soviet revisionists' 20th Congress, and regarded the 'Self-Cultivation' of China's Khrushchev as the standard for communists, failing to recognize that 'Self-Cultivation' completely denies the dictatorship of the proletariat and castrates the revolutionary principle of armed struggle." Indonesian friend Zamukhali also said: "Our party's Politburo has issued a self-criticism document to the whole party, explaining the past mistakes, and when we correct the wrong line, we emphasize how to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and follow Mao Zedong's path. It can be said that we failed because we deviated from Mao Zedong's path." Indonesian friends also said: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us a bit wiser. We now deeply realize that the only path to the liberation of the Indonesian people is the path of Mao Zedong Thought, the path of violent revolution, the path of armed struggle. This is the only correct conclusion drawn from history."

During the visit and tour, Burmese comrades also angrily denounced the crimes of the Soviet Union and China's Khrushchev, who wanted them to negotiate with the reactionaries and surrender to the reactionary military government of Ne Win. They firmly stated: "We will not fall for their tricks. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our Burmese Communist Party will definitely, together with the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world, resolutely oppose modern revisionism, seize political power with guns, and overthrow the Ne Win reactionary government and imperialism." Thai Communist Party comrade Hu Da said: "To achieve revolutionary victory, one must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and walk this Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought path. There is no other path to follow."

Many foreign friends, after listening to this unit's introduction to the victorious path of armed struggle in China, said: Let the "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary path" of modern revisionism go to hell! We are determined to follow China's path. As long as we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and insist on armed struggle, victory will surely be ours.

To build people's armed forces and follow the path of armed struggle, what should be relied on to build and develop this armed force? In the face of the enemy's strength and our weakness, dare we fight? What weapons should be used to defeat the enemy? After listening to the introduction by the leaders of this unit on the unit's implementation of Chairman Mao's "political construction of the army" thought and the series of political work systems proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, such as studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, and carrying out the creation of four-good companies and five-good soldiers, as well as listening to the moving deeds of combat heroes, model workers, and advanced individuals in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, foreign friends deeply realized that they must use the method of emphasizing politics to build their own people's armed forces, emphasize the human factor, dare to struggle and dare to win, and use spiritual atomic bombs to overwhelm the enemy's material atomic bombs.

An African friend said after the visit: "I heard a piece of news that China has the latest weapons. Today, I saw with my own eyes: China's latest and strongest weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." A Japanese friend wrote in his visit impressions: "Although the American imperialists have atomic bombs and various new weapons, they do not have the most important weapon. This weapon is unique to the People's Liberation Army of China, which is Mao Zedong Thought." A Colombian friend said: "The visit made me understand what a new-type army is and how soldiers emphasize politics. Even the simplest shooting is guided by Chairman Mao's quotations." Palestinian friend Basem Hakim said: "What impressed me is their study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics. This army achieves these outstanding results because it has the most beloved great leader Mao Zedong's thought. It is clear that the task of this army is to eliminate the enemies of the world's people. This army tells us: the factor that decides the outcome of the war is people, not weapons."

Many foreign friends praised after the visit: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, clear political goals, brave fighting spirit, great internationalism, are the fundamental reasons for the victory of the People's Liberation Army. They expressed that they would definitely take the People's Liberation Army as their great inspiration and carry the revolution through to the end. A Vietnamese friend said: "Through this visit and study, we have further understood the close friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China and the sincere support of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. We are proud to have the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army as our brothers and comrades." They expressed to the officers and soldiers: "No matter whether the Americans come from the sky or the ground, we will not disappoint the expectations of the Chinese people, and we will resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Chairman Hu, and resolutely, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly drive the American imperialists out of Vietnamese territory." A comrade from South Vietnam who is fighting resolutely against American imperialism said: "With the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought as our strong backing, we are more confident in defeating American imperialism and its lackeys." A Haitian friend said: "Chairman Mao teaches us that revolution has no smooth path, the path is tortuous. However, we believe that difficulties are temporary. As long as the people use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, they can overcome any difficulty. Our future is bright." A comrade from Honduras said: "The revolutionary people of Latin America have already taken up the great weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and are advancing towards the path of liberation. We firmly believe that with Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, our people will definitely be liberated."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "People of the world, unite! Defeat American aggression and its lackeys! People of the world, be brave, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and advance bravely. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts will be destroyed." Friends from the five continents and four oceans of the world, after visiting and touring this unit, said with great enthusiasm: Now the world has entered the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought. The situation of the world revolution is excellent and getting better and better. The doomsday of American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries is approaching. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will fly high all over the world, and a red world illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought will definitely appear!

    学习中国人民解放军，走中国革命的道路
    ——外国朋友参观访问北京部队某部的观感
    忠东军
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“枪杆子里面出政权。”“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是一个已被历史证明了的、放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    应该建立一支什么样的人民武装力量，建立起人民武装力量以后，又应该走什么样的斗争道路？为了寻求这样的革命真理和革命经验，世界各国革命人民，不远万里来到世界革命的中心——中国，参观访问了中国人民解放军北京部队某部。他们把这样的参观访问，当作“最难忘的一天”，当作“一次最有教育意义、最令人鼓舞的参观”。许多外宾在参观访问之后都充满信心地说：“只要我们走中国人民的道路，胜利就一定属于我们。”他们热烈地欢呼：“中国人民解放军万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    要革命，就要象中国那样，建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、全心全意为人民服务的、完全新型的无产阶级革命军队
    外国朋友们步入军营后，首先看到的是，到处都挂着毛主席的彩色画像和毛主席的语录。他们的第一项参观访问活动，就是参加干部、战士活学活用毛主席著作的“讲用会”。
    在整个参观访问过程中，广大指战员天天读毛主席的书，人人听毛主席的话，事事照毛主席的指示办，个个立志要做毛主席的好战士的决心，以及他们对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限热爱、无限崇拜，都使外国朋友们留下了深刻的印象。他们参观访问以后深深地感到：中国人民解放军是一支完全用毛泽东思想武装起来的、思想最先进、行动最统一的无产阶级革命军队。
    今年五月二十二日，日本记者同盟代表团来到这个部队参加指战员们活学活用毛主席著作的“讲用会”。他们一致赞扬：“人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作非常出色”，“‘讲用会’是最好的学习方法”。团员角田荣一感动地说：“我们过去学习马列主义，上面（指日共修正主义分子）强调要系统学，学了许多年，只懂得一些马列主义词句，但与革命实际结合不起来。今天听了三位解放军战士活学活用毛主席著作的介绍，才知道应该象他们那样地学，只有那样学，才能改造自己，指导革命。”
    他们来到连队参观战士宿舍，看到战士们都在床头上写着自己思想上存在的问题和针对这些问题而选择的毛主席语录，更是个个兴致勃勃。团长小林雄一问战士：“是不是全部队每个战士都这样做？”当他们得到肯定的回答时，无限赞叹地说：“全体战士这样学，真是了不起。”
    新西兰共产党凯西同志在参观访问和听取了“讲用会”以后说：“我从解放军战士身上学到了不少东西。”许多外宾在访问后都激动地说：通过这次参观访问，我们最突出的感觉是“毛泽东思想成了每个干部、每个战士的血和肉。”
    外国朋友们访问的这支部队的许多指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，参加“三支”“两军”的工作，坚决支持无产阶级革命派和革命群众。他们的生动事迹使外国朋友感到十分兴奋。同时，这个部队除了自己大搞农副业生产外，还和驻地群众打成一片，不断从政治思想上、人力物力上支援群众。这一切，也使外国朋友非常感动。他们一致赞扬“人民解放军是一支全心全意为人民服务的、完全新型的军队。”
    许多正在为争取民族解放而斗争的革命者，在参观访问了这支部队以后，都激动地表示：他们回国以后，也要为建立一支象中国人民解放军这样用毛泽东思想武装起来的、全心全意为人民服务的、完全新型的人民武装力量而奋斗。一位来自南非的朋友说：“通过参观，更加深刻地认识到毛主席说的‘枪杆子里面出政权’这一英明的论断，是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。白人殖民者能够镇压我们，就是因为他们有枪而我们没有枪。为了解放我们的国家，我们也要建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命军队。”一位东南亚朋友说：“只有建立一支象中国人民解放军那样用毛泽东思想武装起来的、为人民服务的革命军队，才能够战胜美国侵略者及其走狗，才能获得国家和民族的彻底解放。”
    粉碎所谓“和平过渡”、“议会道路”的修正主义谬论，进行暴力革命，走中国革命的道路，走武装斗争的道路
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”外国朋友们在听了这个部队的光荣历史介绍以及当年痛打蒋匪帮和美帝国主义侵略军的战斗英雄事迹以后，联系到本国和世界革命斗争的经验教训，都深刻地认识到：要求得国家和民族的解放，只有走毛泽东的道路，走中国革命的道路，走武装斗争的道路，这是取得革命胜利唯一的道路。
    印尼朋友沙拉姆感触很深，他说：“我国有几十万共产党员和革命者被反动政府杀害了。这是为什么呢？主要是我们违背了毛主席的革命道路，忘记了武装夺取政权。接受了苏修二十大‘和平过渡’、‘议会斗争’的理论，又把中国的赫鲁晓夫的《修养》当作共产党员的标准，没有认识到《修养》完全否认了无产阶级专政，阉割了武装斗争的革命原则。”印尼朋友扎木哈里也说：“我党政治局已向全党发出了一个自我批评的文件，说明了过去所犯的错误，在我们纠正错误路线时，着重提出了怎样活学活用毛主席著作，走毛泽东的道路。可以这样说：我们所以失败，就是脱离了毛泽东道路。”印尼朋友们还说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了。我们现在深刻地认识到，印尼人民解放的唯一道路就是毛泽东思想的道路，暴力革命的道路、武装斗争的道路，这是历史得出来的唯一正确的结论”。
    缅甸同志参观访问时，也愤怒地控诉了苏联的和中国的赫鲁晓夫要他们和反动派进行和谈，向奈温反动军人政权投降的罪行。他们坚定地表示：“我们绝不上他们的当，我们缅甸共产党在毛泽东思想的指导下，一定同中国共产党、中国人民和全世界无产阶级革命人民一道，坚决反对现代修正主义，用枪杆子夺取政权，打倒奈温反动政府和帝国主义。”泰国共产党胡达同志说：“要想获得革命胜利，必须遵照毛主席‘枪杆子里面出政权’这个伟大教导，走这一条马克思列宁主义—毛泽东思想的道路。除此以外绝没有第二条道路可走。”
    许多外国朋友在听了这支部队介绍中国武装斗争的胜利道路以后说：叫现代修正主义的“和平过渡”和“议会道路”见鬼去吧！我们走中国的道路是走定了的。只要我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想做指导，坚持武装斗争，胜利就一定是属于我们的。
    突出政治，突出人的因素，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利
    建立人民武装，走武装斗争之路，靠什么来建设这支武装和发展壮大这支武装？在敌强我弱的条件下，敢不敢斗争，用什么武器去战胜敌人？外国朋友们在听了这个部队的领导同志介绍了部队贯彻执行毛主席“政治建军”的思想和林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作、突出政治、四个第一、三八作风和开展创造四好连队、五好战士运动等一系列政治工作制度后部队出现的新面貌，以及听了战斗英雄、功臣模范活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹以后，深深地认识到：必须用突出政治的方法去建设自己的人民武装力量，突出人的因素，敢于斗争、敢于胜利，用精神原子弹去压倒敌人的物质原子弹。
  一位非洲朋友在参观后说：“我曾听到一个消息，说中国有了最新式的武器。今天我亲眼看到了：中国最新式、最强大的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”一位日本朋友在访问感想中写道：“美帝国主义虽然有原子弹和各种新式武器，但是它没有最重要的武器，这个武器只有中国人民解放军独有，这就是毛泽东思想”。哥伦比亚一位朋友说：“参观使我懂得了什么是新型的军队，懂得了战士们是怎样突出政治的，连一个最简单的射击都是用毛主席语录来指导的。”巴勒斯坦朋友巴赛姆·哈克姆说：“引起我注意的是他们活学活用毛主席著作、突出政治。这个军队所以做出这些出色的成绩，就因为有最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东的思想。很清楚，这个军队的任务，就是消灭世界人民的敌人。这个军队告诉我们：决定战争胜负的因素是人，而不是武器。”
    许多外国朋友参观后赞颂说：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，明确的政治目标，勇敢的战斗精神，伟大的国际主义，是中国人民解放军胜利的根本。他们表示：一定要以中国人民解放军作为自己巨大的鼓舞力量，把革命进行到底。一位越南朋友说：“通过这次参观学习，我们更进一步了解到越中两国人民的亲密友谊和中国人民、中国人民解放军对越南人民抗美救国斗争的诚挚支援。我们为有中国人民，中国人民解放军这样的兄弟、同志而感到自豪。”他们向指战员们表示：“不管美帝从天上来，还是从地上来，我们决不辜负中国人民的期望，坚决响应毛主席、胡主席的号召，坚决、全部、彻底、干净地把美帝赶出越南国土。”正在同美帝国主义进行坚决战斗的一位越南南方战友说：“有用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军做我们的坚强后盾，更加增强了我们战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的信心。”一位海地朋友说：“毛主席教导我们，革命没有直路，道路是曲折的。但是我们相信，困难是暂时的，人民只要用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，就什么困难都可以克服，我们的前途是光明的。”一位洪都拉斯的同志说：“拉丁美洲的革命人民今天已经拿起了毛泽东思想的伟大武器，向着解放的道路前进，我们坚信，有毛泽东思想指引，我们的人民一定能够得到解放。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”全世界五大洲、四大洋的朋友在参观访问这个部队以后都满怀豪情地说：现在世界已经进入了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，世界革命的形势一片大好，越来越好，美帝、苏修和各国反动派的末日已经临近。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗将在全世界高高飘扬，一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想普照的世界必将出现！
