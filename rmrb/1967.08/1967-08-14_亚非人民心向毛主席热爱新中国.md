We were sent by the Party and the people of our motherland, crossing vast oceans to deliver aid materials from our country and the deep affection of the Chinese people to various parts of the world. Everywhere we went, we were warmly welcomed by the local people. They regarded our ship as one sent by Mao Zedong. Many people, despite the hardships, traveled from inland villages to board the ship to view Chairman Mao's portrait, earnestly hoping to obtain Mao badges and Chairman Mao's works. Many touching scenes deeply moved us, making us feel that Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in our hearts but also the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. The revolutionary people of the world look to you, thinking of you day and night. We also deeply feel how fortunate the people of our great motherland are to live in the era of Mao Zedong!

In the port of Latakia, Syria

As soon as the ship anchored, the dock workers' barges approached, and the workers began boarding to unload the cargo. Their first request upon seeing us was for a shiny Mao badge. One worker said, "Mao Zedong is the greatest, I admire him very much, I hope you can give me a Mao badge, I will wear it forever!" Another worker kept gesturing to us, repeatedly patting his chest and pointing to his head, indicating his deep love for Chairman Mao from the heart, and saying, "Mao Zedong is good." When we pinned the shiny Mao badge on their chests, they treasured it like a precious gem, eagerly shaking our hands and repeatedly saying, "Thank you, this is truly wonderful..." "This is the most precious gift in the world."

Many sailors from foreign ships also came on board to view Mao's portrait. Mao is like the rising red sun from the East, illuminating the hearts of the Arab people.

In the port of Dakar, Senegal

The workers here are all black brothers. Although it was our first time here, they welcomed us as if we were old friends. They saw us and immediately asked for Mao badges. A worker named Garu said, "Mao Zedong is a great genius, a great leader, I admire him greatly, every time I hear his name, I feel full of strength, but imperialists tremble when they hear it." He said while gesturing. When we gave him a Mao badge, he was very happy and said, "Your ship doesn't come here often, opportunities are rare, I have been waiting for a long time."

Several elderly black workers, seeing us studying Chairman Mao's works together, came over and asked us to open the Little Red Book so they could carefully look at Mao's portrait. They took it and examined it closely, eagerly kissing Mao's portrait with both hands, reluctant to let go for a long time.

In the port of Pointe-Noire, Congo (Brazzaville)

On a street in Pointe-Noire, Congo (Brazzaville), many people were gathered in front of a shop. We went over to see, and it turned out to be a portrait studio with a large portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform reviewing the Red Guards hanging at the entrance. When the people discovered we were Chinese, they immediately surrounded us. Seeing the Mao badges on our chests, they were envious and requested that we give them Mao badges to wear.

One day, we visited a fishing village. At the village entrance, they welcomed us with the most enthusiastic handshakes and shouted, "Mao Zedong! China! The people of Congo and the people of China are friends." When we gave them our Mao badges, they were very happy.

In the port of Lagos, Nigeria

As soon as the ship entered the harbor, the workers on the dock shouted "Mao Zedong!" enthusiastically towards the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging at our ship's entrance, waving and greeting us warmly.

Around noon, a young African worker came aboard. As soon as he reached the entrance, he shouted loudly, "Mao Zedong!" He raised his strong arm to salute Chairman Mao's portrait, then excitedly shouted, "China is good! Communism is good!" He told us, "I am a driver. I came during my lunch break." He repeatedly expressed his deep love for Mao Zedong and China. He took out many photos of workers' meetings from his pocket, pointing to the people in the photos and saying, "These workers, like me, believe in Mao Zedong." He said, "China is the true socialist country, the true friend of the African people." Then, he pointed to the Soviet revisionist ship docked in front of us and said, "The Soviet revisionists are two-faced, they are in cahoots with the American and British imperialists." He lovingly stroked the Little Red Book in our hands, hoping we could give him one. When we fulfilled his request, he held up the Little Red Book and excitedly said, "This is a treasure!"

Great leader Chairman Mao said, "Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible." "Our friends are all over the world." From this ocean voyage, we once again deeply felt the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao.

    亚非人民心向毛主席热爱新中国
    我们受党和祖国人民的委托，远渡重洋，把我国对外援助的物资和我国人民对世界革命人民的深情厚意带到世界的各个地方。我们每到一个地方，都受到当地人民群众的热烈欢迎。人们把我们的轮船看作是毛泽东派来的船。许多人不辞劳苦，从内陆乡下赶来，要求登轮瞻仰毛主席的画像，恳切地希望能得到毛主席的像章和毛主席著作……。许许多多的动人的场面，使我们深深地感到，毛主席啊！您老人家不仅仅是我们心中的红太阳，而且也是世界革命人民心中的红太阳，世界革命人民心向着您，日日夜夜地想念您。我们也深深地感到生活在伟大的毛泽东时代祖国的人民是多么幸福啊！
    在叙利亚拉塔基亚港
    船刚刚在锚地下好锚，码头的驳船就靠拢上来，工人陆续上船，准备卸货了。他们见到我们第一个要求就是，希望能赠送给他们一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。有的工人说，“毛主席最伟大，我非常敬仰他，希望你们给我一枚毛主席的像章，我将永远佩戴它！”有的工人还向我们不断地打着手势，他们一再抚摸着自己的心口，一面又指着自己的头，表示从心里热爱毛主席，嘴里还讲着“毛主席好”。当我们把金光闪闪的毛主席像章别在他们的胸前时，他们如获至宝，双手热烈地握着我们的手，不断地说“谢谢，真是太好了……”，“这是世界上最珍贵的礼物”。
    不少外国轮船的海员也到船上争看毛主席的像。毛主席就象从东方升起的红日照亮了阿拉伯人民的心。
    在塞内加尔达喀尔港
    这里的工人都是黑人兄弟。虽然我们第一次到这里，但他们却象欢迎老朋友一样欢迎了我们。他们见到我们便争着要毛主席像章。一个名叫加鲁的非洲工人说，“毛主席是伟大的天才、伟大的领袖，我十分崇拜他，每当听到他的名字，我就浑身有力，可是帝国主义听了就发抖。”他一边说一边比划着。我们把一枚毛主席像章赠给他时，他十分高兴地说，“你们的船不常来这里，机会很少，我已盼了很久了。”
    几个年老的黑人工人，见到我们集体学习毛主席著作时，凑上前来要求我们把语录本打开，让他们仔细看看毛主席像，他们接过去以后，仔细端详，争先恐后地用双手捧着深情地吻着毛主席的像，久久舍不得松手。
    在刚果（布）黑角港
    在刚果（布）黑角港一条大街上的一家店铺面前站了许多人。我们过去一看，原来这里是一个画像的作坊，门口挂了一张大幅的毛主席身穿军装检阅红卫兵的画像。当人们发现了我们是中国人以后，立刻把我们围拢起来。他们看见我们胸前带的毛主席像章，十分羡慕，就要求把毛主席像章送给他们佩戴。
    有一天，我们到渔民村去访问。在村口上他们用最热烈的握手礼节欢迎了我们，并且高呼“毛主席”、“中国”、“刚果人民和中国人民是朋友”。当我们把自己带的毛主席像章送给他们时，他们十分高兴。
    在尼日利亚拉各斯港
    船刚驶入港口，码头上的工人就对着我们船上梯口悬挂的毛主席像大声高呼“毛主席！”热情招手向我们致意，表示友好、欢迎。
    快到中午吃饭时，上来一位年轻的非洲工人。刚刚走到梯口时，就大声高呼“毛泽东！”他举起有力的胳膊向毛主席像致敬礼，接着又激动地喊道，“中国好！”“共产主义好！”。他告诉我们说，“我是一个司机。我是趁中午吃饭休息时间来的。”他向我们一再表示他十分热爱毛泽东和中国。他从衣袋里拿出许多工人集会的照片，指着上面的人说，“这些工人和我一样是十分信仰毛泽东的。”他又说，“中国是真正的社会主义，是非洲人民的真正朋友。”接着，他又指着停在我们前面的苏修轮船说，“苏修对非洲人民是两面三刀，他们和美帝、英帝是一伙的。”他爱不释手地抚摸着我们手中的《毛主席语录》，希望能送一本给他。当我们满足了他的要求时，他把《毛主席语录》高高举起，兴奋地说：“这是一本宝书啊！”
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”“我们的朋友遍天下。”从这一次远洋航行中，我们又一次深深地体会了毛主席所指出的这个真理。
