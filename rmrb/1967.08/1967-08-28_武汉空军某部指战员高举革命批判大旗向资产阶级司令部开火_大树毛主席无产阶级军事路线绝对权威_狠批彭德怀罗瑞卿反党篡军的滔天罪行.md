	Air Force personnel in a certain unit in Wuhan have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism and opened fire on the bourgeois command. They have firmly upheld the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and severely criticized the heinous crimes of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who are the vanguard of the anti-party coup in the military.

	The People's Daily reports: Recently, the personnel of a certain unit in the Wuhan Air Force held a symposium. With boundless loyalty to defending the proletarian command headed by Chairman Mao, they severely criticized the heinous crimes of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who are the vanguard of the anti-party coup in the military, led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	These personnel come from factories, rural areas, and schools. Under the guidance of the general line, they have personally participated in the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes. After joining the army, they have tasted the bitterness of the bourgeois military line and the sweetness of the proletarian military line. During the Cultural Revolution, they fearlessly sacrificed themselves to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the proletarian command, and the proletarian revolutionary faction. At the symposium, they used their personal experiences to denounce the malicious attacks by the Chinese Khrushchev and his anti-party vanguard, Peng Dehuai and his ilk, on the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. They also exposed the crimes of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing in promoting the bourgeois military line.

	At the symposium, five-good soldiers from Shandong, Henan, and Hunan—Cui Anguang, Hu Xihai, and Liu Kunru—cited numerous facts to refute the shameless lies of the Peng Dehuai anti-party clique in their malicious attacks on the Three Red Banners.

	Cui Anguang said, "I have lived in rural areas, schools, and factories. My personal experiences are enough to refute the nonsense of Peng Dehuai and his ilk. The cooperatives, especially the people's communes, blocked the path of capitalism in the countryside and led hundreds of millions of peasants onto the road to collective happiness. In 1965, when I returned home for a visit, I saw that my hometown had changed greatly. Each person had an average of four to five hundred jin of grain per year, and there was no worry about food and clothing. The changes in people's spiritual outlook were even greater. Everyone was studying Chairman Mao's works and building a socialist new countryside with great enthusiasm." Cui Anguang said, "Shandong used to have no steel enterprises. After the mass movement of steel production in 1958, steel enterprises were established, and steel production continued to increase. These are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious achievements of the Three Red Banners."

	Other soldiers in their speeches also used ironclad facts to illustrate the tremendous changes in their hometowns under the radiance of the Three Red Banners. They emphasized that the general line is absolutely correct, the Great Leap Forward is absolutely superior, and the people's communes are good! Whoever opposes the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, we will overthrow them!

	Vice platoon leader Que Xiangfu, platoon leader Qin Qiusheng, and party branch committee member Zhai Weizhong, who have been in the army for a longer time, exposed with irrefutable facts the crimes of the great schemer, great conspirator, and great warlord Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing in their rampant opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and their active promotion of the bourgeois military line.

	Zhai Weizhong and Qin Qiusheng said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and we absolutely do not allow the gun to command the party.' But Peng Dehuai advocates the so-called 'one-command system,' attempting to cancel the party's absolute leadership over the army. Chairman Mao says: 'The army must integrate with the masses,' but Peng Dehuai tries every means to separate the army from the masses. All of this is in opposition to Chairman Mao's military line and is thoroughly revisionist."

	Luo Ruiqing completely inherited Peng Dehuai's legacy, vigorously peddling the black goods of 'military excellence is political excellence,' focusing on military competitions to the detriment of politics, and heavily promoting material incentives. His agents within the military in the Wuhan region vigorously promoted his methods, saying things like 'if a platoon's average grenade throw reaches forty meters, reward them with a fat pig,' encouraging soldiers to 'carry grenades with them, throw them before and after meals,' and advocating for 'hanging five-good on the gun muzzle, four-good on the cannon muzzle,' and so on. This way, soldiers were exhausted, with no time to study Chairman Mao's works or politics.

	Que Xiangfu said, "Since Comrade Lin Biao, who has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took over the work of the Military Commission, he has vigorously emphasized proletarian politics and established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The face of the troops has undergone fundamental changes. Taking our platoon as an example, because everyone studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, continuously breaks private interests and establishes public interests, we have been rated as four-good for consecutive years. Last year, five-good soldiers accounted for 80% of the total number of soldiers; this year in the first half of the year, more than 90% of the people were rated as five-good soldiers."

	The comrades participating in the symposium said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our army. With Mao Zedong Thought, soldiers have courage, wisdom, master military technology quickly, and in battle, everyone will be like little tigers, daring to fight and kill, definitely able to overwhelm the enemy and never be overwhelmed by the enemy. Everyone expressed that they must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois military line in the revolutionary criticism, establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line, and build our army into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought!"

	The comrades participating in the symposium believed that at present, it is necessary to firmly implement the latest instructions of Comrade Lin, the vice commander-in-chief: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." First of all, it is necessary to firmly support the proletarian revolutionary faction and defend the proletarian revolutionary faction. Use the great Mao Zedong Thought to help them achieve revolutionary great unity and great alliance, carry out revolutionary great criticism, do a good job of educating the deceived masses, grasp the revolution, and promote production. For their shortcomings, they should also conduct comradely and well-intentioned criticism. Only in this way can they help them grow stronger and move forward continuously.

	The comrades participating in the symposium reviewed the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of supporting the left. They said that in the future, they must study and apply Chairman Mao's works more seriously, thoroughly reform their subjective world, learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction, truly love what the revolutionary faction loves, hate what the revolutionary faction hates, think what the revolutionary faction thinks, and be concerned about what the revolutionary faction is concerned about. Together with the revolutionary faction, they must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the bourgeois command, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    武汉空军某部指战员高举革命批判大旗向资产阶级司令部开火
    大树毛主席无产阶级军事路线绝对权威
    狠批彭德怀罗瑞卿反党篡军的滔天罪行
    本报讯　武汉空军某部的指战员近日举行座谈会，怀着保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反党篡军的急先锋彭德怀、罗瑞卿的滔天罪行。
    这些指战员们，有的来自工厂，有的来自农村，有的来自学校。他们在总路线的光辉照耀下，亲自参加过大跃进和人民公社的实践。参军以后，他们吃到过资产阶级军事路线的苦头，也尝到了无产阶级军事路线的甜头。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们不怕牺牲，坚决保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫了无产阶级司令部，保卫了无产阶级革命派。在座谈会上，他们用亲身经历的事实，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的反党急先锋彭德怀之流对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的恶毒攻击；控诉了彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行资产阶级军事路线的罪行。
    在座谈会上，来自山东、河南、湖南的五好战士崔安光、胡西海和刘坤如，列举大量事实，驳斥了彭德怀反党集团恶毒地攻击三面红旗的无耻谰言。
    崔安光说，我在农村、学校和工厂都呆过。我的亲身经历，就足以驳斥彭德怀之流的胡言乱语。合作化特别是人民公社化，堵塞了农村发展资本主义的道路，使亿万农民走上了集体幸福的大道。一九六五年，我回家探亲，看到家乡大变了样子。每人每年平均有四、五百斤粮食，吃穿都不愁。人们精神面貌的变化，那就更大了。人人都在学习毛主席著作，意气风发地建设社会主义新农村。崔安光说，山东过去没有钢铁企业，经过一九五八年大炼钢铁的群众运动，钢铁企业建立起来了，钢铁产量日益提高。这些都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都是三面红旗的辉煌成果。
    其他战士在发言中，都用铁的事实，说明了自己家乡在三面红旗的光辉照耀下的巨大变化。他们强调说，总路线就是无比正确，大跃进就是无比优越，人民公社就是好！谁反对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，我们就打倒谁！
    入伍时间较长的副指导员阙祥富、排长秦秋生、党支部委员翟维忠，以无可辩驳的事实，揭发了大野心家、大阴谋家、大军阀彭德怀、罗瑞卿猖狂反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线、积极推行资产阶级军事路线的罪行。
    翟维忠和秦秋生说，毛主席教导我们：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党。”而彭德怀却搞什么一长制，妄图取消党对军队的绝对领导。毛主席说：
  “军队须和民众打成一片”，而彭德怀却千方百计要使军队和群众隔离。……这一切，都是和毛主席的军事路线相对抗，是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。
    罗瑞卿完全继承了彭德怀的衣钵，大力兜售“军事好就是政治好”的黑货，搞大比武冲击政治，还大搞物质刺激。他在武汉地区军内的代理人，大力推行他的那一套，说什么“那个连平均投弹达四十米，就奖给他们一口肥猪”，要战士“手榴弹随身带，饭前饭后投起来”，鼓励大家把“五好挂在枪口上，四好挂在炮口上”，等等。这样，就搞得战士精疲力尽，没有时间学习毛主席著作，没有时间学习政治。
    阙祥富说，一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志主持军委工作以来，大力突出无产阶级政治，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，部队面貌起了根本的变化。拿我们连队来说，由于大家活学活用毛主席著作，不断破私立公，连年都被评为四好。去年，五好战士占战士总人数的百分之八十；今年上半年，百分之九十以上的人，都评上了五好战士。
    参加座谈会的同志说，毛泽东思想是我军的生命。有了毛泽东思想，战士就有了勇气，有了智慧，掌握军事技术就快，打起仗来，个个就会象小老虎，敢拚、敢杀，一定能压倒敌人，绝不会被敌人所压倒。大家都表示，一定要在革命的大批判中，彻底肃清资产阶级军事路线的流毒，树立毛主席军事路线的绝对权威，把我军建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
    参加座谈会的同志认为，当前一定要坚定不移地贯彻执行林副统帅的最新指示：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”首先，就要坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，保卫无产阶级革命派。要用伟大的毛泽东思想，帮助他们实现革命的大团结、大联合，开展革命的大批判，做好受蒙蔽群众的工作，抓好革命，促好生产。对于他们的缺点，也要进行同志式的、善意的批评。这样，才能帮助他们不断壮大，不断前进。
    参加座谈会的同志回顾了前一阶段支左工作的经验教训。他们说，今后一定要更认真地学好用好毛主席著作，狠狠改造自己的主观世界，向无产阶级革命派学习，真正做到爱革命派所爱，恨革命派所恨，想革命派所想，急革命派所急。要同革命派一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，为无产阶级文化大革命运动立新功。
