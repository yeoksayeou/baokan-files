The Malian government delegation, led by its head Sedou Badian Kouyaté, arrived in Beijing by plane this evening. The delegation is in China at the invitation of the Chinese government for a friendly visit.

Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council and relevant officials Fang Yi, Han Nianlong, Chu Tu-nan, Ding Xilin, and Hu Lijiao, along with Chinese Ambassador to Mali Ma Ziqing, and over a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital, went to the airport to give a warm welcome.

Tonight, the capital airport was adorned with the national flags of both China and Mali. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners, singing revolutionary songs to greet the Malian friends. After Kouyaté, the head of the delegation, stepped off the plane, representatives of the capital's revolutionary masses presented the Malian friends with "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles."

When the Malian guests met with the welcoming crowd, people waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Firmly support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mali!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The Malian Ambassador to China, Gisse, and diplomatic envoys from other African countries in China also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

    马里政府代表团到达北京
    新华社三日讯　应我国政府邀请前来我国进行友好访问的马里政府代表团，在团长塞杜·巴迪安·库亚特率领下，今天晚上乘飞机到达北京。
    国务院副总理陈毅和有关方面负责人方毅、韩念龙、楚图南、丁西林、胡立教，中国驻马里大使马子卿，以及首都革命群众一千多人前往机场热烈欢迎。
    今天晚上，首都机场飘扬着中马两国国旗。欢迎的群众高举着毛主席像和标语牌，高唱革命歌曲，迎候马里朋友。当库亚特团长走下飞机以后，首都革命群众代表向马里朋友赠送了《毛主席语录》，并朗读毛主席的教导：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”
    马里客人和欢迎群众见面时，人们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断地高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“坚决支持亚非拉各国人民的民族解放斗争！”“中国和马里两国人民的友谊万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    马里驻中国大使吉塞和非洲国家驻中国使节也前往机场欢迎。
