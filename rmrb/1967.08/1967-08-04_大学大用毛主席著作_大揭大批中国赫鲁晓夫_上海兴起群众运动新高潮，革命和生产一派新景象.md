In the current high tide of exposing, criticizing, and struggling against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is sweeping across all fronts in Shanghai. The broad ranks of revolutionary cadres and masses of the proletariat are determined to use the great criticism movement as the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly criticize and repudiate all bourgeois and exploitative class ideologies, and to establish proletarian and Mao Zedong thought. They use Mao Zedong thought as a telescope and microscope to thoroughly expose, criticize, and repudiate the Chinese Khrushchev. This great learning movement has made the revolutionary criticism movement on all fronts in Shanghai more thorough, more detailed, and more solid, powerfully promoting the development of the criticism movement.

The broad ranks of revolutionary cadres and masses of the proletariat in Shanghai firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The situation is constantly changing, and to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study." Their action slogan is: Study to advance the revolutionary criticism and struggle, study to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

One of the most prominent features of this extensive study of Chairman Mao's works in Shanghai is that it closely combines with the current exposure, criticism, and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev; it uses Mao Zedong thought to lead the criticism, making the revolutionary criticism movement the most vivid, practical, and profound movement to popularize and educate Mao Zedong thought, and making it a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The proletarian revolutionary cadres and masses in Shanghai's industry, transportation, agriculture, culture and arts, and education sectors, in addition to repeatedly studying the brilliant works such as the "Three Articles," have specially compiled and studied Chairman Mao's instructions related to their respective systems to arm their minds. With Mao Zedong thought as the sharpest ideological weapon, they layer by layer peel off the mask of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Another prominent feature of this study movement in Shanghai is to closely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, insisting on studying while fighting and rectifying. As soon as Chairman Mao's instructions on the Cultural Revolution are issued, the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Shanghai immediately act upon them, promptly study them, and implement them resolutely. As soon as Chairman Mao's teaching on "guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the revolutionary path of the proletariat" reaches Shanghai, many revolutionary mass organizations immediately study it repeatedly. They constantly examine and overcome various petty-bourgeois ideologies within their ranks, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle.

Another prominent feature of this extensive study of Chairman Mao's works in Shanghai is its unprecedented scale, lively and varied forms, and diverse methods. Factories, rural areas, offices, schools, and the military are all filled with a serious learning atmosphere, carrying out various forms of learning activities, properly arranging fixed learning time, and insisting on learning, undeterred by storms.

In the learning process, in addition to continuing some effective learning forms from the past, some have also held short-term study classes on Chairman Mao's works. In these study classes, not only do organizations with the same views sit together to learn, but organizations with differing views also sit on the same bench to learn, resolving differences through learning. Some factories and enterprises have launched mass activities to extensively study, apply, sing, recite, and propagate Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles," achieving immediate results.

This extensive study movement has had an immeasurable impact on the healthy development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. As Comrade Lin Biao said, Mao Zedong thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, becoming a spiritually powerful atomic bomb. This extensive study movement is driving all work in Shanghai forward along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously developing and achieving new successes.

Firstly, this extensive study movement has powerfully promoted the current intense exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The proletarian revolutionary cadres, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong thought, have launched an unprecedented large-scale criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, cleansing the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison he spread in various fields. The proletarian revolutionary cadres in Shanghai have jointly held more than ten televised struggle meetings to thoroughly settle accounts with the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai for their counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes. At the same time, the proletarian revolutionary cadres on all fronts use the "arrows" of Mao Zedong thought to shoot at the "target" of the revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in their respective systems and departments, determined to thoroughly cleanse these poisons! All departments and fronts, with thousands of fingers pointing and ten thousand arrows flying, have completely submerged the Chinese Khrushchev in the vast ocean of mass revolutionary criticism.

Secondly, this extensive study and criticism movement has powerfully promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." In recent periods, the pace of revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in Shanghai's factories, schools, enterprises, and offices has accelerated compared to the past, with many encouraging new situations emerging. In the industrial sector, previously, the proportion of medium and small factories that achieved revolutionary great unity was relatively large, but recently it has developed to some large factories. On the financial and commercial front, the revolutionary mass organizations at the district level in all ten districts of the city have fully achieved revolutionary great unity. More than 200 district-level professional companies, as well as banks, tax bureaus, and other units, have also achieved more than 90% great unity. On the educational front, broad revolutionary teachers and students have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions and taken action, resuming classes and making revolution, with the situation being very good.

Thirdly, in promoting production and work, this new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has also played a powerful driving role. Many factories have not only exceeded the state plan month after month in recent months, providing the state with more and better products, but have also, in the process of extensive study, used Mao Zedong thought to criticize some past unreasonable regulations that constrained people, fully mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm and creativity. Recently, they have successively developed and produced a series of high-level new products.

    大学大用毛主席著作  大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫
    上海兴起群众运动新高潮，革命和生产一派新景象
    据新华社上海三日电　本社记者述评：在当前对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮中，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动已在上海各条战线上广泛深入地开展起来。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，决心把革命大批判运动作为活学活用毛主席著作的最好的课堂，大破一切剥削阶级思想、大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想；用毛泽东思想的望远镜和显微镜，彻底批倒、批臭、批透中国的赫鲁晓夫。这场伟大的学习运动，使上海各条战线的革命大批判开展得更深入，更细致，更扎实，强有力地推动了大批判运动的发展。
    上海广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众牢记毛主席的教导：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”他们提出的行动口号是：为推进革命的大批判、大斗争而学习，为巩固和加强无产阶级专政而学习。
    上海这次毛主席著作大学习运动的一个最显著的特点是，大学习同当前对中国的赫鲁晓夫大揭发、大批判、大斗争紧密结合；用毛泽东思想统帅大批判，把革命的大批判运动作为最生动、最实际、最深刻的毛泽东思想大普及、大教育运动，作为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。上海工业、交通运输、农业、文化艺术、教育等方面的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在大学习运动中除了反复学习“老三篇”等光辉著作外，还专门把毛主席有关本系统的指示，汇集起来学习，武装自己的头脑，以毛泽东思想这一最锐利的思想武器，层层剥开中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮。
    紧跟紧学毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，坚持边学习，边战斗，边整风，这是上海这次大学习运动的另一个显著特点。毛主席有关文化大革命的指示一发表，上海无产阶级革命派就闻风而动，及时学习，雷厉风行地执行。毛主席关于“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导一传到上海，许多革命群众组织立即反复学习。他们不断检查克服自己队伍中存在的各种小资产阶级思想，紧紧掌握斗争大方向。
    上海这次毛主席著作大学习运动的又一个显著特点是，规模空前未有，形式生动活泼，方法多种多样。工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队，到处都充满了认真学习的气氛，开展着形式多样的学习活动，妥善安排了固定的学习时间，坚持学习，雷打不散。
    在学习中，除继续采用过去一些行之有效的学习形式外，有的还举办毛主席著作短期学习班。在学习班里，不但观点相同的组织坐在一起学，观点不一致的组织也坐到一条板凳上来学习，通过学习，消除分歧。有些工厂企业开展群众性的大学、大用、大唱、大背、大宣传毛主席语录和“老三篇”的活动，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    这次大学习运动，对上海无产阶级文化大革命的健康发展，产生了不可估量的作用。正如林彪同志所说的那样：毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。这个大学习运动，推动着上海一切工作沿着毛主席的革命路线滚滚向前，不断发展，不断取得新的成就。
    首先，这个大学习运动强有力地推动了当前正在如火如荼地开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。无产阶级革命派以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，发动了规模空前的大批判，大斗争，肃清这一小撮在各个领域里散布的反革命修正主义毒素。上海无产阶级革命派联合召开的彻底清算中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人反革命修正主义罪行的电视斗争大会，到目前已举行了十多次。同时，各条战线上的无产阶级革命派用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射中国赫鲁晓夫在本系统、本部门散布的修正主义流毒这个“的”，决心坚决彻底肃清这些流毒！各个部门、各条战线千夫所指，万箭齐发，使中国赫鲁晓夫完全陷于群众性的革命大批判的汪洋大海之中。
    其次，这个大学习、大批判运动，有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。近一时期来，上海地区的工厂、学校、企业、机关的革命的大联合和“三结合”，进度比过去加快，出现了许多可喜的新气象。在工业部门，前一时期实现革命大联合的，占比例较大的是些中小型工厂，而最近已发展到一些大型工厂。在财贸战线上，全市十个区财贸系统区一级的革命群众组织，已经全部实现了革命大联合。全市二百多个区级专业公司以及银行、税务局等单位，也已有百分之九十左右实现了大联合。在教育战线上，广大革命师生反复学习了毛主席指示，也纷纷行动起来，复课闹革命，形势很好。
    再次，在促生产、促工作方面，这个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，也起了强大的推动作用。许多工厂最近几个月不仅月月超额完成国家计划，给国家提供了更多更好的产品，而且还在大学习中，用毛泽东思想批判了过去一些束缚人们手脚的不合理的规章制度，充分调动群众的积极性和创造性，最近接连试制和生产出一系列高水平的新产品。
