Currently, a small wave of anti-China sentiment is sweeping the world. Figures like Ne Win, Suharto, and Zedenbal have all jumped out, loudly and aggressively spreading anti-China propaganda. They are making a ruckus and stirring up trouble. In reality, behind these anti-China clowns, the strings are being pulled by none other than the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. The U.S. imperialists and their number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionists, are the instigators and supporters of all anti-China conspiracies, the masterminds behind the anti-China farce.

Chairman Mao has said: "The current situation in the world is one where the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution are engaged in their final struggle. These two great forces have raised two great banners: one is the red banner of revolution, ... calling on all oppressed classes around the world to rally under its banner; the other is the white banner of counter-revolution, ... calling on all counter-revolutionaries around the world to rally under its banner."

Today, the Chinese people are holding high the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and all revolutionary forces around the world are rallying under this red banner. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have raised the white banner of counter-revolution, and all counter-revolutionary forces around the world are rallying under this white banner. In this struggle between the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are inciting all reactionary forces to fiercely oppose China. This is the inevitable logic of class struggle.

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are spreading malicious rumors and igniting fires of hatred everywhere, relentlessly slandering China and creating anti-China public opinion. Wherever reactionaries stir up anti-China waves, they fan the flames and cheer them on. The Ne Win clique's frenzied anti-China actions immediately received praise from the U.S. imperialists. The Soviet revisionists also eagerly supported the Ne Win clique's anti-China atrocities, even praising its fascist regime as a "revolutionary government." The U.S. imperialists treat the Indonesian reactionaries, who are fiercely anti-China and anti-Chinese, as their darlings. The Soviet revisionists also praise the Indonesian reactionaries for implementing a "policy of national independence" and being "anti-imperialist." The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are so eager to incite anti-China sentiment and cheer on their lackeys. Doesn't this clearly expose that all these anti-China schemes are being carried out under their command?

Not only that, whoever is anti-China, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists will throw money at them and provide them with weapons. The more fervently they are anti-China, the more they will give. The U.S. imperialists gave India $7.6 billion in economic "aid" and a large amount of military weapons, most of which were given after the Indian reactionaries openly opposed China. Similarly, because the Indian reactionaries are fiercely anti-China, the Soviet revisionists have already given India more than $1.2 billion in economic "aid" and $900 million in military "aid," and have promised to provide another $2 billion in "non-military aid."

For the Indonesian fascist military regime, the U.S. imperialists have agreed to provide $80 million in "aid." In addition to agreeing to extend the repayment of $1.2 billion in debt for the Indonesian fascist regime, the Soviet revisionists will also lend Indonesia $120 million. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are so generous in providing blood transfusions to these anti-China lackeys. Isn't this even more clearly exposing that they are the bosses behind these anti-China clowns?

Ne Win, Suharto, and Zedenbal and the like are either slaves of the U.S. imperialists, or puppets of the Soviet revisionists, or lackeys jointly raised by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. These reactionaries were either propped up by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists or rely on groveling to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to survive. They have aligned themselves with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists and must, therefore, follow their bosses' orders to fiercely oppose China. This is not at all surprising.

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have gathered all kinds of reactionaries, public enemies, revolutionary traitors, national traitors, social dregs, political zombies, and all the filth that is despised by humanity, and ordered them to fiercely oppose China, staging one anti-China farce after another. This is actually a good thing. It more clearly distinguishes the camps of revolution and counter-revolution, proving that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are the headquarters of world counter-revolutionary forces, while China is a great revolutionary country. The demons and monsters of the world are so eager to oppose the Chinese people. This is indeed a great honor for the Chinese people.

All the anti-China schemes of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their big and small lackeys will do nothing to harm the powerful socialist China. The 700 million Chinese people will stride forward with giant steps, together with revolutionary people around the world, to push the wheel of history rolling forward, and crush all anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary pests!

    美帝苏修是反华丑剧的总后台
    本报评论员
    目前，世界上出现一股小小的反华浪潮。什么奈温，什么苏哈托，什么泽登巴尔之流，一个一个地跳了出来，大肆反华。他们吵吵嚷嚷，兴风作浪。其实，在这些反华小丑背后牵线的，不过是美帝和苏修两家。美帝及其头号帮凶苏修是一切反华阴谋的策动者和支持者，是导演反华丑剧的总后台。
    毛主席曾经说过：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。这两大势力竖起了两面大旗：一面是红色的革命的大旗，……号召全世界一切被压迫阶级集合于其旗帜之下；一面是白色的反革命的大旗，……号召全世界一切反革命分子集合于其旗帜之下。”
    今天，中国人民高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想红色的革命的大旗，全世界革命势力都集结在这面红旗之下。美帝苏修打起了白色的反革命的大旗，全世界一切反革命势力都集结在这面白旗之下。在这一场革命和反革命两大势力的搏斗中，美帝和苏修策动一切反动势力，疯狂地反对中国，这是阶级斗争的必然的逻辑。
    美帝和苏修到处煽阴风，点邪火，竭力诽谤中国，大造反华舆论。哪里的反动派掀起反华浪潮，它们就推波助澜拍手叫好。奈温集团疯狂反华，立即得到美帝的赞扬。苏修也竭力替奈温集团的反华暴行帮腔，甚至吹捧它的法西斯政权是什么“革命政府”。美帝把疯狂反华排华的印尼反动派当作宠儿。苏修也吹捧印尼反动派实行的是“民族独立方针”、是“反帝国主义”的。美帝和苏修这样起劲地煽动反华，为它们的娄罗们打气，难道不正好暴露了这一切反华勾当都是在它们的指挥下干出来的吗？
    不但这样，谁反华，美帝和苏修就给谁抛赏钱，送军火。反华越起劲，它们给的就越多。美帝给了印度七十六亿美元的经济“援助”和大量军火武器，其中绝大部分是在印度反动派公开反华以后给的。同样，由于印度反动派疯狂反华，苏修也已经给了印度十二亿美元以上的经济“援助”，九亿美元的军事“援助”，并且保证再提供二十亿美元的“非军事援助”。
    对于印尼法西斯军人政权，美帝答应提供八千万美元的“援助”。苏修除了答应印尼法西斯政权延期偿还十二亿美元的债款以外，还将向印尼贷款一亿二千万美元。美帝和苏修这样不惜工本地给这些反华走卒们输血，不更是清清楚楚地暴露了它们是这些反华小丑的后台老板吗？
    奈温、苏哈托和泽登巴尔之流，有的是美帝的奴才，有的是苏修的附庸，有的是美帝苏修共同豢养的走狗。这些反动家伙，本来就是美帝和苏修扶植上台的，或者是靠着向美帝和苏修摇尾乞怜过活的。他们投靠了美帝苏修，就必然要按照他们老板的命令，疯狂反华，这是丝毫也不奇怪的。
    美帝和苏修把世界上形形色色的反动派，人民公敌，革命叛徒，民族败类，社会渣滓，政治僵尸以及一切不齿于人类的狗屎堆，都搜罗起来，指使它们疯狂地反对中国，演出一幕又一幕反华丑剧。这其实是一件好事。它更明显地划清了革命和反革命的营垒，证明美帝和苏修是世界反革命势力的大本营，而中国则是一个伟大的革命国家。世界上的牛鬼蛇神，魑魅魍魉，这样起劲地反对中国人民，这正是中国人民的极大光荣。
    美帝苏修及其大大小小走狗的一切反华勾当，都丝毫无损于强大的社会主义中国。七亿中国人民将迈开巨人的步伐，同全世界革命人民一起，推动历史车轮滚滚前进，把一切反华、反共、反人民、反革命的害人虫，统统辗个粉碎！
