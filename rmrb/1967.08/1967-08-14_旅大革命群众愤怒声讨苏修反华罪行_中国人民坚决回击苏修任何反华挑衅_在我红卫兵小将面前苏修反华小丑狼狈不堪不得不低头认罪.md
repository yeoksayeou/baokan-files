Traveling revolutionary masses and Red Guards held a rally this afternoon to furiously denounce the severe provocations by the crew of the Soviet revisionist cargo ship "Svirlsk" in the port of Dalian, where they shamelessly insulted the badge of our great leader Chairman Mao.

On the morning of August 6, the second officer Ivanov and a crew member of the Soviet revisionist cargo ship "Svirlsk" actively requested badges of our great leader Chairman Mao from Chinese border inspection personnel. They then, in the presence of our border inspection personnel, shamelessly insulted the badges and threw one into the sea. This is a grave insult to the badges of our great leader Chairman Mao, which are revered by the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world. After the incident, our relevant departments twice ordered the Soviet ship captain Korshkov to immediately hand over the perpetrators to our relevant departments for interrogation and trial. However, under the instructions of the Soviet embassy in China, Korshkov repeatedly defied the orders of our relevant departments, shielding and indulging the perpetrating crew members. This severe anti-China incident by the Soviet revisionists has aroused great indignation among the local revolutionary masses and Red Guards, who held a rally to denounce the anti-China crimes of Korshkov and Ivanov.

Speakers at the rally unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest leader of the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will overthrow them! Seven hundred million Chinese people cannot be insulted! The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, cannot be insulted! The arrogant anti-China elements like Johnson, Kosygin, and Brezhnev will not escape historical punishment.

The revolutionary masses attending the rally repeatedly shouted slogans such as: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Brezhnev! Down with Kosygin!" "Soviet revisionists' anti-China actions will meet a bad end!" "Long live the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

The Soviet revisionist clowns Korshkov and Ivanov, in the face of the angry revolutionary masses and Red Guards, were exposed in all their ugliness, in a state of utter disarray, and had to bow their heads and confess their crimes.

The rally unanimously passed a letter of protest to the Soviet revisionist authorities. The letter strongly protests the severe incident where the anti-China criminals Korshkov and Ivanov insulted the badge of our great leader Chairman Mao on the sacred soil of the People's Republic of China and provoked the seven hundred million Chinese people. The letter points out that the Soviet authorities must bear full responsibility and all consequences for this serious political incident. The letter also sternly warns the Soviet revisionist authorities: the seven hundred million Chinese people and Red Guards are not to be trifled with. Any anti-China provocations will only result in lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet and will meet with the resolute counterattack of the Chinese people.

In response to the strong demands of the revolutionary masses and Red Guards, and in accordance with our country's laws, our relevant authorities announced on the spot the decision to expel the Soviet ship captain Korshkov and second officer Ivanov from the country, banning them from ever entering China again, and to escort the Soviet cargo ship out of the country under armed guard. This decision was warmly supported by the revolutionary masses at the rally.

    在我红卫兵小将面前苏修反华小丑狼狈不堪不得不低头认罪
    新华社旅大十三日电　旅大市革命群众、红卫兵小将今天下午举行集会，愤怒声讨苏修“斯维尔斯克”号货船船员在大连港肆意侮辱我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章的严重挑衅事件。
    八月六日早晨三时，苏修“斯维尔斯克”号货船二副依万诺夫和一名船员，主动向中国边防检查人员索取中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章，然后又当着我边防检查人员的面，肆意加以侮辱，并将一枚像章扔到海里，这是对中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章的极大侮辱。事件发生后，我有关部门两次责令苏联船长柯尔若夫立即把肇事者交由我有关部门传讯、审理。但柯尔若夫在苏联驻华使馆的指使下，多次顽抗我有关部门的命令，包庇和纵容肇事船员。苏修的这一严重反华事件激起了当地革命群众和红卫兵小将的极大愤怒，他们举行大会声讨反华罪犯柯尔若夫和依万诺夫的反华罪行。
    在大会上发言的人一致指出，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全中国人民和全世界革命人民最伟大的领袖，谁反对毛主席，我们就打倒谁！七亿中国人民不可侮！全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席不可侮！猖狂反华的约翰逊、柯西金、勃列日涅夫之流，决逃不脱历史的惩罚。
    参加大会的革命群众不断高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！打倒柯西金！”“苏修反华决没有好下场！”“全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    苏修反华小丑柯尔若夫、依万诺夫，在愤怒的革命群众和红卫兵小将面前，丑态百出，狼狈不堪，不得不低头认罪。
    大会一致通过给苏修当局的抗议书。抗议书就反华罪犯柯尔若夫、依万诺夫在我们伟大的中华人民共和国国土上侮辱我们伟大的领袖毛主席像章、向我七亿中国人民挑衅的严重事件，向苏修当局提出最最强烈的抗议。抗议书指出，对这次严重的政治事件，苏联当局必须承担全部责任及所产生的一切后果。抗议书还严重警告苏修当局：七亿中国人民和红卫兵小将不是好惹的，任何反华挑衅都只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，都将遭到中国人民的坚决回击。
    根据革命群众和红卫兵小将的强烈要求，根据我国的法律，我国有关方面在会上当场宣布处分决定：将苏联船长柯尔若夫和二副依万诺夫驱逐出境，不准他们再来中国，并将苏联货船武装押送出境。这个决定在会上受到了革命群众的热烈拥护。
