The Japanese Communist Party Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left) is Established
The Miyamoto Group's Leading the JCP onto the Path of Opportunism and Counter-Revolution Will Inevitably Meet with Complete Failure

New China News Agency, August 9th: Tokyo News: According to the "Changzhou News" report, Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought adherents in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, issued a statement on July 15th, solemnly declaring the establishment of the Japanese Communist Party Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left). This is another victory in the struggle against the revisionist group of Miyamoto within the JCP.

The statement said: "We, on this 45th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, to hoist the revolutionary banner that has been discarded by the revisionist group of Miyamoto, to correctly inherit the glorious history and revolutionary traditions of the JCP that are being falsified and distorted by them, under the guidance of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought, together with the revolutionary people, we will walk the path of the Japanese revolution (which is part of the world revolution), and establish the Japanese Communist Party Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left)."

The statement said, the revisionist group of Miyamoto, from the "Sixth National Congress" to the formulation of the new program, has aligned itself with the revisionist line of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the program, it wrote "the path of peaceful transition through parliament" and other contents, under the pretext of the enemy's attitude having "two possibilities," it wholeheartedly took the parliamentary road, beautified American imperialism and its running dogs, the Japanese monopolies, praised bourgeois democracy, and turned the party from a vanguard into a "party that engages in elections," leading the party onto the path of opportunism and counter-revolution.

The statement pointed out that as early as the great struggle against the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" in 1959-1960, the revisionist group of Miyamoto was afraid of the revolutionary surge of the masses and tried to suppress it, which was a typical manifestation of their opportunist line.

The statement said, the revisionist group of Miyamoto also used the unity of the international communist movement as an excuse to exonerate the crimes of the Soviet Union, using the so-called international unified action to attempt to isolate China, openly attacking Mao Zedong Thought, in response to the reactionary Liberal Democratic Party attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, abandoning proletarian internationalism and inciting nationalism, and receiving praise from the Japanese bourgeois reactionaries.

The statement pointed out: American imperialism, with the active collusion of Japanese monopolies, is using Japan as an important strategic base, under the tacit agreement of Soviet modern revisionism, is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam are waging a resolute struggle against American imperialism. The People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are making the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people and have become a strong backing for the Vietnamese people. In contrast, the revisionist group of Miyamoto, in Japan, not only does not organize a thorough struggle to support the Vietnamese people centered on the working class, but also does not organize anti-American patriotic struggles. Instead, it spreads the terror of war, arouses the sentimental psychology of the petty bourgeoisie, and advocates the theory of international unified action, attempting to provide a place for the traitorous Soviet modern revisionism to hatch conspiracies.

The statement said: "To struggle against American imperialism, one must also struggle to the end against Soviet modern revisionism. Soviet modern revisionism is implementing capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, propagating bourgeois ideology and culture; on the international stage, it plays the role of a 'reliable friend' of American imperialism." Yet the revisionist group of Miyamoto repeatedly defends the Soviet revisionists, saying things like "Kosygin is different from Khrushchev."

The statement pointed out that whether it is the American empire and its running dogs in various countries, or the Soviet revisionists and the revisionist group of Miyamoto, the revolutionary flames of the people of the world will, in a short period of time, reduce these counter-revolutionary forces to ashes.

The statement warmly applauds the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. It said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is advancing victoriously. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is in a fierce struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line and has achieved great victories.

The statement pointed out: "The relationship between the Japanese people and the true communists and communists who are willing to devote themselves to the revolution with the revisionist group of Miyamoto has become an antagonistic relationship, a life-and-death struggle." The statement appeals: "The attitude that true communists should take is only one: that is, not only to draw a clear ideological and political line with the revisionist group of Miyamoto, but also to resolutely draw a clear organizational line. This is the attitude of being responsible to the revolution and the masses."

The statement refuted the fallacy spread by the revisionist group of Miyamoto that "even if there are differences in opinion, even if it is wrong, one must follow the discipline of obeying the superiors and the majority." The statement quoted Comrade Mao Zedong's words: "All words and actions of communists must take the greatest benefit of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." The statement emphasized: "To obey the discipline of the Miyamoto group, which has abandoned the revolutionary banner and betrayed the Japanese people, is to surrender to the traitors."

The statement said: "We appeal to the majority of comrades who are still bound by the discipline of the Miyamoto group but are willing to devote themselves to the revolution, hoping that they will soon break with the revisionist group of Miyamoto and join the ranks of the Japanese people's liberation under the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and unite with the Japanese Communist Party Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left)."

The statement said: We will follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in the future to walk the true revolutionary path. We will, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the people of the world who demand liberation, and strive for the liberation of the Japanese people and the people of the world.

The statement finally shouted: "Long live the Japanese Communist Party Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left) armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the international proletarian unity of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism!"

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　大造宫本修正主义集团的反
    日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）宣告成立
    宫本集团把日共引上机会主义、反革命道路必将遭到彻底失败
    新华社九日讯　东京消息：据《长周新闻》报道，日本兵库县坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的共产主义者，七月十五日发表声明，郑重宣告成立日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派），这是日本革命的共产党人大造日共宫本修正主义集团的反所取得的又一个胜利。
    声明说：“我们，在今天日本共产党建立四十五周年的时候，为了高举起已被宫本修正主义集团抛弃的革命旗帜，正确地继承正被它们伪造、歪曲的日本共产党的光辉历史和革命传统，在当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的指导下，同革命人民一道走日本革命（它是世界革命的一部分）的道路，成立了日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）。”
    声明说，宫本修正主义集团，经过“第六次全国代表会议”到制定新纲领的时候，靠拢苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的修正主义路线，在纲领中写上了“通过议会实行和平过渡的道路”等内容，借口敌人的态度有“两种可能性”，就一心一意地走议会主义的道路，美化美帝国主义及其走狗日本垄断资本，颂扬资产阶级民主，使党从先锋队堕落成为“搞选举的党”，把党引上了机会主义、反革命的道路。
    声明指出，早在一九五九年到一九六○年进行伟大的反对“日美安全保障条约”斗争的时候，宫本修正主义集团就害怕群众斗争出现革命的高涨，企图加以压制，这是他们的机会主义路线的典型。
    声明说，宫本修正主义集团还以国际共产主义运动的团结为口实开脱苏联的罪责，搬出所谓国际统一行动企图孤立中国，公然攻击毛泽东思想，同自由民主党反动派相呼应攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，抛弃无产阶级国际主义而煽动民族沙文主义，受到日本资产阶级反动派的夸奖。
    声明指出：美帝国主义，在日本垄断资本的积极共谋下，把日本当作重要的战略据点，在苏联现代修正主义的默契下，正在扩大侵略越南的战争。越南南方人民和北方人民，对美帝国主义进行了坚决的斗争。中华人民共和国和中国人民，在毛泽东同志的领导下，不惜任何民族牺牲，最坚决地支持越南人民，成为越南人民强大的后盾。相反，宫本修正主义集团，在日本不仅不组织以工人阶级为中心的彻底的支援越南人民的斗争，不组织反美爱国斗争，而是大肆宣扬战争的恐怖，唤起小资产阶级的感伤心理，鼓吹国际统一行动论，企图给叛徒苏联现代修正主义以策划阴谋的场所。
    声明说：“要同美帝国主义斗争，就必须也同苏联现代修正主义斗争到底。苏联现代修正主义在苏联国内实行资本主义复辟，宣扬资产阶级思想和文化；在国际舞台上扮演美帝国主义的‘可靠朋友’的角色。”可是宫本修正主义集团一再为苏修辩解，说什么“柯西金和赫鲁晓夫不同”。
    声明指出，无论是美帝和它在各国的走狗，也无论是苏修和宫本修正主义集团，全世界人民的革命火焰终将在不长的时期内把这些反革命势力化为灰烬。
      声明热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。它说，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在胜利前进，以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线进行激烈的斗争，已经取得了伟大的胜利。
      声明指出：“日本人民和愿意献身于革命的真正的共产党人、共产主义者同宫本修正主义集团的关系已经成为敌对的关系，成为你死我活的对抗性矛盾了。”声明发出呼吁：“真正的共产主义者应该采取的态度只有一种。那就是不仅在思想上和政治上同宫本修正主义集团划清界线，而且在组织上也要坚决地划清界线。这才是对革命、对人民群众负责的态度。”
    声明驳斥了宫本修正主义集团散布的“即使意见有分歧，那怕是错误的，也必须遵守服从上级、服从多数的纪律”的谬论。声明引用了毛泽东同志的话：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”声明强调指出：“服从抛弃革命旗帜、背叛日本人民的宫本集团的纪律就是向叛徒投降。”
    声明说：“我们向至今还受宫本集团的纪律束缚而愿意献身于革命的大多数同志呼吁，希望他们早日同宫本修正主义集团一刀两断，参加到反帝、反修旗帜下的日本人民解放的队伍中来，团结到日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）方面来。”
    声明说：我们今后要在毛泽东思想的指导下走真正的革命道路，我们要在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导下，同要求解放的全世界人民团结在一起，为日本人民和世界人民的解放而奋斗。
      声明最后高呼：“用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）万岁！”“反帝、反修的国际无产阶级的团结万岁！”“当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想万岁！”
