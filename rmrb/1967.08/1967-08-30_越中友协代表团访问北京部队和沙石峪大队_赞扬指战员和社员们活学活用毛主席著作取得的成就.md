A delegation from the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Chairman Nguyen Van Huan and Vice Chairman Ho Kwei, recently visited the Beijing garrison of the People's Liberation Army and the famous Shashiyu Brigade of Yuguzhuang People's Commune in Xian County, Hebei Province. They brought news of the Vietnamese people's victories in their struggle against American imperialism and expressed the deep friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples.

During their visit to the Beijing garrison of the People's Liberation Army, Nguyen Van Huan praised the soldiers for their outstanding achievements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to promote ideological revolution. He said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, you have transformed yourselves through studying Chairman Mao's works and become new people who serve the people wholeheartedly. Your achievements are a great support and encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American imperialism. We are proud to have such a strong rear base. We, the Vietnamese people, are determined to fight to the end with American imperialism until there is not a single American aggressor on Vietnamese soil."

At Shashiyu Brigade, the Vietnamese friends visited terraced fields and orchards. They highly praised the self-reliant and hardworking revolutionary spirit of the brigade members. Ho Kwei said, "You have studied Chairman Mao's works, transformed yourselves, and transformed nature. You have accomplished a great cause because you have the great thought of Mao Zedong. We must learn from your spirit of 'moving mountains like the foolish old man.'"

Member of the delegation, young combat hero Thai Van A from Hon Giao Island, gave reports at the Beijing garrison and Shashiyu Brigade, introducing the glorious achievements of the military and people of Hon Giao Island in their struggle against American imperialism.

During their visit to the Beijing garrison and Shashiyu Brigade, the Vietnamese friends were warmly welcomed by the soldiers and brigade members of the People's Liberation Army. Wherever they went, they were greeted with slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live Chairman Hu," and "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism." Soldiers and brigade representatives presented Mao badges to the Vietnamese friends, and the Vietnamese comrades gave them handicrafts made from the wreckage of downed American imperialist planes.
