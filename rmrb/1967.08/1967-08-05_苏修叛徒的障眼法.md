On July 12, the Soviet revisionist Foreign Ministry responded to our Foreign Ministry's note announcing the expiration of the Sino-Soviet-North Korean maritime rescue agreement by sending a note to our embassy in the Soviet Union, making shameless attacks on our country. Following this, the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* used this incident to launch a major anti-China campaign, falsely claiming that this would put Soviet ships bound for Vietnam at risk from the United States and maliciously accusing China of "serving the U.S. imperialists directly." Such slanderous tactics are utterly despicable!

Since the signing of this maritime rescue agreement, the Chinese side has always fulfilled its obligations. Now, the Chinese government, in accordance with the agreement's provisions, has declared its expiration, which is our right and a normal matter in international relations, beyond reproach. The Soviet revisionist clique uses this as an excuse to slander China, which is simply unreasonable. It is precisely you who, during the agreement's validity period, repeatedly violated and breached the agreement. You have always pursued the most despicable great-power chauvinism, never keeping your word, and treating the tearing up of agreements as a common practice, which is infamous. In the past, you unilaterally tore up hundreds of agreements and contracts signed with China. This year, you have successively torn up two agreements on mutual visa exemption and smallpox vaccination certificates. Now, you are making a big fuss about the maritime rescue agreement, which is nothing but the pot calling the kettle black.

The Soviet revisionist clique's purpose in playing this trick is simply to cover up your criminal collusion with U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the Vietnamese people. However, such a smoke screen is futile.

The Soviet revisionists' so-called "aid" to Vietnam is utterly false. You send a few ships to deliberately flaunt your presence, deceiving world public opinion, but in reality, it is to gain capital for your dirty dealings with the U.S. imperialists on the Vietnam issue. You and the U.S. imperialists have long reached a tacit understanding, taking "parallel but not conflicting" actions, helping the U.S. imperialists peddle their "peace talk" black goods, indulging the U.S. imperialists in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and even publicly embracing the U.S. imperialists. Your leader Kosygin swore allegiance to the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson face to face, offering strategies and betraying the Vietnamese people and the people of the world revolution. Isn't this directly serving the U.S. imperialists?

To be frank, U.S. imperialism is fully aware of your so-called "aid" to Vietnam. You appear to be "aiding" Vietnam, but in reality, you are aiding the United States. Precisely because of this, not long ago, the United States publicly stated that it would take "special measures" to ensure the safety of Soviet ships off the coast of Vietnam. In late March of this year, the Soviet revisionist Minister of Maritime Transport also publicly admitted: "The navigation of Soviet ships to Vietnam is unimpeded." Isn't the confession of your maritime transport minister a slap in your own face?

Politically declining figures often resort to slander and false accusations to shift attention and hide their true selves when they are doing shameful deeds. The Soviet revisionist clique now cannot live without manufacturing anti-China rumors. This reflects the desperate plight of this small clique of traitors.

Lenin said: "Boasting and lying is moral decay, which inevitably leads to political decay." Gentlemen of the Soviet revisionist clique, go ahead and concoct your rumors and slanders. The more rumors you spread, the more disgrace you bring upon yourselves, and the faster your complete downfall will come.

    苏修叛徒的障眼法
    本报评论员
    七月十二日，苏修外交部就我国外交部关于宣布中苏朝海上救护协定期满失效的照会，复照我驻苏使馆，对我国进行无耻的攻击。接着，苏修《消息报》又借着这件事，大做反华文章，胡说什么这将使苏联赴越南船只受到美国威胁，并且恶毒地诬蔑中国“为美帝直接效劳”。这种造谣诽谤的手法，真是卑劣至极！
    自从这个海上救护协定签订以来，中国方面始终履行了自己的义务。现在，中国政府根据协定条款提出期满失效，这是我们的权利，是国际关系中的正常事情，是无可非议的。苏修集团拿这件事做口实，大肆诽谤中国，简直是无理取闹。恰恰是你们自己在这个协定生效期间，不断地违反和破坏协定。你们一贯奉行最恶劣的大国沙文主义，从来不讲信义，把撕毁协定当作家常便饭，已是恶名昭彰。过去，你们就单方面撕毁了同中国签订的几百个协定和合同。今年以来，又先后撕毁了中苏互免签证和天花预防接种证书两个协定。现在，你们在海上救护协定问题上大吵大嚷，不过是贼喊捉贼。
    苏修集团所以要搞这套把戏，无非是想掩盖你们勾结美帝国主义，出卖越南人民的罪恶勾当。但是，这种障眼法是徒劳的。
    苏修集团对越南的所谓“援助”，根本就是假的。你们弄几条船，故意招摇过市，欺骗世界舆论，实际上是为了取得在越南问题上同美帝进行肮脏交易的资本。你们同美帝不仅早已达成默契，采取“并行不悖”的行动，帮助美帝推销“和谈”黑货，纵容美帝扩大侵越战争，而且已经公开同美帝拥抱，你们的头子柯西金面对面地向美帝头子约翰逊宣誓效忠，出谋划策，出卖越南人民和世界革命人民。这难道不是最直接地为美帝效劳吗？
    老实说，美帝国主义对你们的所谓“援助”越南，心里完全是明白的。你们表面上是“援”越，其实是援美。正是因为这样，不久以前，美国曾经公开表示，要采取“特殊措施”来保障苏联船只在越南海岸的安全。今年三月底，苏修海运部长也曾公开承认：苏联赴越船只的航行“是畅通无阻的”。你们的海运部长直认不讳的供状，岂不是打了你们自己的耳光吗？
    政治上的没落人物在做亏心事的时候，常常借造谣诽谤来转移视线，来隐身的。苏修集团现在离了制造反华谣言，便过不了日子。这正反映了这一小撮叛徒的穷途末路。
    列宁说：“吹牛撒谎是道义上的灭亡，它势必引向政治上的灭亡。”苏修集团的先生们，你们挖空心思地去造谣诽谤吧。你们造的谣越多，出的丑就越大，你们彻底垮台的日子就会更快地到来。
