The proletariat must seize power through armed struggle, not through the "parliamentary road." This is a fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The entire history of the international communist movement tells us that all big and small revisionists have always been "parliamentary fetishists." Without exception, they deny that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution, and they always use the bourgeois parliament as a marketplace to sell out the fundamental interests of the proletariat, becoming the most shameful traitors of the working class.

In China, the most prominent representative is the top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party. He has always been China's biggest "parliamentary fetishist" and also the biggest "parliamentary fetishist" in the contemporary world.

In 1945, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the question of where China was heading became a sharp issue before the entire nation. "Should we establish a new democratic republic led by the proletariat and for the people, or should we establish a semi-colonial, semi-feudal republic ruled by the big landlords and big bourgeoisie? This will be a very complicated struggle." This extremely sharp struggle was a decisive battle between two destinies and two futures for China.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the moment of the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "We must be soberly aware that the danger of civil war is very serious, because Chiang Kai-shek's policy has been decided. According to Chiang Kai-shek's policy, civil war is to be waged." To defend the fruits of victory, "our policy is to counterattack, inch by inch."

At this critical moment, China's Khrushchev, on February 1, 1946, issued a "Report on the Current Situation," openly defying Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, proposing the reactionary fallacy of a "new stage of peace and democracy," vigorously advocating the "parliamentary road," saying that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle." He also said: "The Party's entire work must undergo a transformation, and all our organizations must change, transforming to non-armed struggle as the main form, ... we must know how to propagate, how to make speeches, how to conduct election campaigns, and we must all vote for you."

In short, he wanted to engage in legal struggle and take the "parliamentary road."

This was China's Khrushchev's black program to promote the "parliamentary road" in China, another major exposure of his traitorous face of class capitulationism and national capitulationism.

At that time, was China, as China's Khrushchev claimed, already in a "new stage of peace and democracy"? No, it was not.

Just as China's Khrushchev was dreaming of the "parliamentary road," Chiang Kai-shek was sharpening his knives, talking while fighting, using American planes and warships to massively deploy troops to the front lines of the civil war. Full-scale civil war was imminent and about to break out. Chiang Kai-shek's counterrevolutionary actions gave a resounding slap in the face to China's Khrushchev, who was spouting nonsense about the "parliamentary road"!

What is a parliament? In capitalist countries, a parliament is merely a decoration and screen for bourgeois rule. The main part of the bourgeois state machine is force, not the parliament. Whether the bourgeoisie implements a parliamentary system or abolishes the parliament, and how much power it grants to the parliament, is all decided according to the needs of bourgeois rule. Under the condition that the bourgeoisie has a powerful state machine, to want to transition to socialism peacefully through the "parliamentary road" is completely a malicious deception. In today's world, there are only painful lessons of socialist countries peacefully transforming into capitalist countries, and there is no precedent of a capitalist country peacefully transitioning to socialism. Of course, the proletariat, under certain conditions, can use the parliament as a platform to expose the abscesses of bourgeois society, educate the masses, accumulate revolutionary forces, and prepare for the armed seizure of power, but it absolutely cannot use parliamentary struggle to replace violent revolution. Lenin had long ago pointed out: "If the class struggle is limited to parliamentary struggle, or if parliamentary struggle is considered the highest, decisive, and dominant form of struggle that governs all other forms of struggle, then this is actually turning to the side of the bourgeoisie and against the proletariat." China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle" is precisely "turning to the side of the bourgeoisie and against the proletariat."

In capitalist countries, the "parliamentary road" does not work. In semi-feudal, semi-colonial China, especially in post-war China, the "parliamentary road" is even more a dead end. Chairman Mao had long pointed out that in the old China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, "there is no democratic system internally, but it is oppressed by the feudal system; there is no national independence externally, but it is oppressed by imperialism. Therefore, there is no parliament to be utilized, and there is no legal right for workers to organize strikes. Here, the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter the uprising and war through long-term legal struggle, nor is it to first occupy the cities and then take the countryside, but to take the opposite path." To use armed revolution against armed counterrevolution, this is the objective law of the Chinese revolution's victory, the necessary path for the Chinese revolution's victory.

However, China's Khrushchev, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, actually denied this objective law of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, we must ask:

Does this mean that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the characteristics of the Chinese revolution disappeared? Did the basic laws of the Chinese revolution cease to function?

Does this mean that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the butchers who do not blink an eye at killing people, led by Chiang Kai-shek, suddenly became angels of peace and democracy?

Does this mean that to deal with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, who are armed to the teeth, all you need to do is make a speech in the parliament and win a few votes, and you can achieve peace and democracy in China?

When the Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, were sharpening their knives to cut off our heads, if we followed the "parliamentary road" advocated by China's Khrushchev, relying on votes to enter the city, the result would definitely not be the "basic success" of the democratic revolution, and we would not be able to enter Chiang Kai-shek's city, but would only lose our own city, and only thousands and tens of thousands of heads would fall, and the future of the Chinese revolution would be squandered in vain.

While China's Khrushchev advocated the "parliamentary road," he also blatantly opposed armed struggle and advocated surrendering to the Nationalists. He openly proposed "reorganizing the army," turning our army into the "national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense forces," and in the army, "abolishing the Party organization, ... stopping direct leadership and command of the army, unifying under the Ministry of Defense." China's Khrushchev even shamelessly believed that such "concessions" would "not change the essence of the army, but gain legality, ... this is profitable, it's a money-making deal."

This is the logic of a complete traitor.

In fact, such "concessions" are no different from signing a confession in the enemy's prison. Gaining such "legality" can only mean complying with Chiang Kai-shek's laws and the Nationalists' laws. Achieving such "unification" means unifying the Communist Party into the Nationalists.

"The essence of the army has not changed," this is the traitor's sophistry. Let me ask, without the leadership of the Communist Party, whose army is it? Whose direction will the gun barrels point at? The army has changed in nature, and the gun barrels will turn. Without the army, there is nothing revolutionary, and it is even more impossible to talk about winning the revolution.

From 1936 to 1946, for a full ten years, China's Khrushchev never forgot to surrender the military power to the Nationalists. As early as May 1936, when he was doing work in the white areas in the North Bureau, he wrote an article in a reactionary bourgeois publication under the pen name Tao Shangxing, titled "A Letter to the Communist Party." This black article advocated surrendering the people's armed forces to the Nationalists and creating a "unified army with the same system and organization," completely in tune with Wang Ming's capitulationism. If we compare China's Khrushchev's statements in 1946 with those in 1936, we can discover that the only difference is that this time he handed over the weapons more decisively and more thoroughly. China's Khrushchev chose the most acute moment of class struggle to eagerly sell out the people's armed forces, completely to curry favor with the American-Chiang reactionaries, in order to get a good position in the Nationalist government. It is truly shameful.

In the international communist movement, surrendering weapons to the enemy in exchange for a few seats in the parliament and positions such as vice-premier or minister is not a new invention of China's Khrushchev. After World War II, Thorez surrendered his weapons, Togliatti surrendered his weapons, and the Greek Communist Party, which was about to reach Athens, also surrendered its weapons. The result? The weapons were surrendered, and the "legal" status was canceled. A large number of genuine revolutionaries were brutally massacred, and the blood of the martyrs became the wine in the enemy's cup. Where was the "money-making" business? It was clearly a cheap sale of the revolutionary cause, the greatest betrayal of the people's interests.

Lenin once said: "The bourgeoisie uses armed force to suppress the proletariat, this is the most serious, fundamental, and important fact of modern capitalist society. Faced with such a fact, someone actually advises revolutionary social democrats to propose the 'demand' to 'abolish armed forces'! This is equivalent to completely abandoning the class struggle viewpoint, abandoning all revolutionary ideas." China's Khrushchev is precisely such an old opportunist who abandons all revolutionary ideas.

Faced with this revisionist countercurrent in the international communist movement, at that time, only our great leader Chairman Mao firmly resisted it! Chairman Mao proposed in opposition: "The people's armed forces, every gun and bullet, must be preserved and cannot be surrendered." This is a summary of the experience of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement, a strategic thought of great world significance, a wise decision to oppose rightist capitulationism, and also the basic guarantee for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to achieve complete victory.

China's Khrushchev was so enthusiastic about advocating the "parliamentary road" and opposing the armed seizure of power because he was afraid of revolution, afraid of war, afraid of losing his head, and only wanted to comfortably rise in rank and get rich. Such a person, in prison, would certainly surrender and betray the revolution; and in the face of violent revolution, he would be terrified and vigorously advocate legal struggle. China's Khrushchev's shameful betrayal activities completely suited the needs of American imperialism and the dictator Chiang Kai-shek to dissolve and annihilate the Communist Party, to extinguish the proletarian revolution, and to maintain the American-Chiang reactionary rule.

China's Khrushchev was so enthusiastic about advocating the "parliamentary road" for another reason. He claimed that at that time, China had "conditions that had never existed in history." These conditions were: three countries (Britain, America, and the Soviet Union) were assisting China's democratic movement. China had three parties (the Nationalists, the Communists, and the Democratic League) that wanted to cooperate to democratize China. China had three main classes (the working people, the middle bourgeoisie, and a part of the big bourgeoisie) that demanded democracy in China. This was his basis for taking the "parliamentary road."

This is sheer nonsense. In China's Khrushchev's depiction, the American and British imperialists suddenly became Buddhas, and they actually assisted China's "democratic movement." Is this the truth? No! At that time, the established policy of American imperialism was to help Chiang Kai-shek wage civil war and turn China into an American vassal. The American government used promoting Chinese democratization as a cover to strengthen Chiang Kai-shek's military power in all aspects and, through Chiang Kai-shek's policy of massacre, suppress the Chinese people's revolution. China's Khrushchev also regarded American and British imperialism as a force assisting China's democratic movement. Isn't this recognizing the enemy as a father, completely and thoroughly standing on the side of American imperialism?

Three parties "want to cooperate," three classes "demand democracy in China"! This is also a big lie. The big bourgeoisie and the working people have absolutely no common demands. The Nationalists and Chiang Kai-shek are ruthless in seizing power and profits from the people. In August 1945, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in the article "Comment on the Speech of Chiang Kai-shek's Spokesman": Chiang Kai-shek is the enemy of the people. However, half a year later, China's Khrushchev dared to openly stand on the side of the enemy of the people, exonerate Chiang Kai-shek, and turn the enemy of the people into the people, and turn the butcher who does not blink an eye at killing into an angel of "promoting peace and democracy." Isn't this completely and thoroughly acting as Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman?

The practice of the Chinese revolution completely shattered China's Khrushchev's illusions. The Chinese people did not listen to his nonsense but, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, after three years of bloody struggle, finally overthrew the Nationalist reactionary rule, won the great victory of the War of Liberation, and established the People's Republic of China.

After the founding of New China, China's Khrushchev was still not reconciled and stubbornly promoted his set of capitulationist theories, trying to spread them all over the world. In 1962, he wanted the Burmese Communist Party to "bury their weapons and reorganize the army into 'national defense forces' (Ne Win's reactionary army); cooperate with Ne Win to jointly build socialism." In April 1963, during his visit to Indonesia, he shamelessly praised the "Nasakom" path, saying in private conversations that it was good for the Indonesian Communist Party to have more people as ministers in the government, so they could accumulate more experience in managing the country.

This is China's Khrushchev's great betrayal of the Chinese people, a great betrayal of the Asian people, and a great betrayal of the world people. China's Khrushchev is the enemy of the Chinese people and also the enemy of the world people.

China's "parliamentary fetishists" have completely collapsed. Big and small "parliamentary fetishists" around the world have also hit a wall everywhere. Chairman Mao's great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is increasingly being grasped by the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations of the world. The flames of armed struggle are burning fiercely in Burma, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions. They are criticizing the old world with guns, and this is also the most powerful criticism of China's Khrushchev. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose China's biggest "parliamentary fetishist" and the entire set of capitulationist fallacies he advocates, and sweep them all into the garbage bin of history.

    中国“议会迷”的破产
    《文汇报》编辑部　《解放日报》编辑部　《支部生活》编辑部
    无产阶级要夺取政权，是通过武装斗争，还是走“议会道路”，这是马克思列宁主义和修正主义的一个根本分歧。国际共产主义运动的全部历史告诉我们，大大小小的修正主义者从来就是“议会迷”。他们无一例外地否认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，一向以资产阶级议会作为交易所，干着出卖无产阶级根本利益的勾当，成为工人阶级最可耻的叛徒。
    在中国，最突出的代表人物就是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。他历来是中国最大的“议会迷”，也是当代世界上最大的“议会迷”。
    一九四五年，抗日战争胜利后，中国向何处去？这个问题尖锐地摆在全国人民的面前。“是建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家呢，还是建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？这将是一场很复杂的斗争。”这场极其尖锐的斗争是中国两个命运、两种前途的决战。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在抗日战争取得最后胜利的时刻就指出：“必须清醒地看到，内战危险是十分严重的，因为蒋介石的方针已经定了。按照蒋介石的方针，是要打内战的。”为了保卫胜利果实，“我们的方针是针锋相对，寸土必争”。
    就在这个关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫于一九四六年二月一日，抛出了一个《时局问题报告》，公然违抗毛主席的革命路线，提出了“和平民主新阶段”的反动谬论，大肆鼓吹“议会道路”，说什么“中国革命主要斗争形势已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”。又说：“党的全部工作要实行转变，我们的一切组织要改变，转变到以非武装斗争为主，……要会作宣传，会演说，会作选举运动，要大家投你的票”。
    一句话，要搞合法斗争，要走“议会道路”。
    这是中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在中国推行“议会道路”的黑纲领，是他推行阶级投降主义、民族投降主义的叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    当时的中国，是否象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样，已经出现了“和平民主新阶段”呢？没有，没有。
    正当中国的赫鲁晓夫大做“议会道路”的迷梦时，蒋介石就磨刀霍霍，边谈边打，用美国飞机和兵舰，大量地调兵遣将到内战前线。全国全面内战迫在眉睫，一触即发。蒋介石的反革命行动，给大弹“议会道路”滥调的中国赫鲁晓夫，以一记响亮的耳光！
    议会是个什么东西？在资本主义国家里，议会只是资产阶级统治的装饰品和屏风。资产阶级国家机器的主要部分是武力，而不是议会。资产阶级实行议会制还是取消议会制，究竟赋予议会以多大的权力，总是按照资产阶级统治的需要来决定的。在资产阶级掌握了强大的国家机器的条件下，要想通过“议会道路”和平过渡到社会主义，这完全是一种恶意的欺骗。在当今世界，还只有从社会主义国家和平演变为资本主义国家的惨痛的教训，而没有一个资本主义国家和平过渡到社会主义的先例。当然，无产阶级在一定条件下，可以利用议会这个讲坛，揭露资产阶级社会的脓疮，教育人民群众，积蓄革命力量，准备武装夺取政权，但绝不能用议会斗争代替暴力革命。列宁早已指出：“如果把阶级斗争局限于议会斗争，或者认为议会斗争是最高的、决定性的、支配着其余一切斗争形式的斗争，那就是实际上转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级。”中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”，正是“实际上转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级”。
    在资本主义国家里，“议会道路”走不通。在半封建半殖民地的中国，特别在抗战胜利后的中国，“议会道路”更是一条绝路。毛主席早就指出，旧中国在蒋介石的统治下，“在内部没有民主制度，而受封建制度压迫；在外部没有民族独立，而受帝国主义压迫。因此，无议会可以利用，无组织工人举行罢工的合法权利。在这里，共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”用武装的革命反对武装的反革命，这就是中国革命取得胜利的客观规律，是中国革命胜利的必由之路。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫在抗日战争胜利后，居然否定了这个中国革命的客观规律。因此，我们要问：
    难道说，抗日战争胜利以后，中国革命的特点就从此消失了吗？中国革命的基本规律就从此不起作用了吗？
    难道说，抗日战争胜利以后，以蒋介石为首的一伙杀人不眨眼的刽子手，竟然变成了和平民主的天使了吗？
    难道说，对付武装到了牙齿的蒋介石匪帮，就凭你在议会中发表了一通演说，争取了几张选票，就能在中国实现和平民主吗？
    在国民党蒋介石磨刀擦枪，要割我们的头的时候，如果循着中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“议会道路”走去，靠选票进城，其结果，决不可能是民主革命的“基本成功”，决不能进蒋介石的城，而只能失去自己的城，只能是千百万人头落地，白白断送了中国革命的前途。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“议会道路”的同时，还赤裸裸地反对武装斗争，主张向国民党交枪。他公然提出“军队也要整编”，要把我们的军队整编“成为国军、国防军、保安队、自卫队”，要在军队中“取消党的组织，……停止对军队的直接领导、指挥，统一于国防部”。中国的赫鲁晓夫甚至恬不知耻地认为这样的“让步”，“军队本质未改，但取得了合法，……这是化得来的，是赚钱的”。
    这真是十足的叛徒逻辑。
    其实，这样的“让步”，无异于在敌人的监狱里打自首的手印。取得这样的“合法”，只能是合蒋介石之法，合国民党之法。实现这样的“统一”，就是把共产党“统一”到国民党里去了。
    “军队本质未改”，这是叛徒的诡辩。试问没有共产党的领导，那成了谁家的军队呢？他们的枪口会对准谁呢？军队变了质，枪口就会转向。没有了军队，就没有革命的一切，更谈不上取得革命的胜利。
    从一九三六年到一九四六年整整十年间，中国赫鲁晓夫始终没有忘记向国民党交兵权。早在一九三六年五月，他在北方局搞白区工作时，就在反动的资产阶级刊物上，用陶尚行的笔名写过《关于共产党的一封信》。这篇黑文，主张把人民武装交给国民党，搞一个“同一制度同一组织的统一军队”，完全和王明的投降主义相唱和。如果把中国赫鲁晓夫一九四六年的言论和一九三六年的言论加以比较，那就可以发现，前后的不同，只是这次送得更干脆，交得更彻底。中国赫鲁晓夫选择在阶级斗争最尖锐的时刻，迫不及待地出卖人民武装，完全是为了讨好美蒋反动派，以便在国民党政府中谋个一官半职的好差使。真不知天下有羞耻事。
    在国际共产主义运动中，向敌人交枪来换取议会中几个席位，争个副总理或部长之类的差使，这并不是中国赫鲁晓夫的什么新创造。第二次世界大战以后，多列士交了枪，陶里亚蒂交了枪，希腊共产党快打到雅典了，也交了枪。结果呢？枪交掉了，“合法”地位取消了，大批真正的革命党人惨遭杀害，烈士的鲜血变成敌人杯里的酒浆。那里是什么“赚钱”的生意，分明是对革命事业的廉价大拍卖，是对人民利益的最大背叛。
    列宁曾经说过：“资产阶级用武装镇压无产阶级，这是现代资本主义社会的一个最严重、最基本和最重要的事实。面对这样的事实，有人竟劝告革命社会民主党人提出‘废除武装’的‘要求’！这就等于完全放弃阶级斗争的观点，放弃一切革命的思想。”中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这样一个放弃一切革命的老机会主义者。
    面对国际共产主义运动中的这股修正主义逆流，当时只有我们伟大的领袖毛主席坚决顶住它！毛主席针锋相对地提出：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”这是中国革命和国际共产主义运动的经验总结，这是具有极大世界意义的一个战略思想，是反对右倾投降主义的英明决策，也是使中国革命和世界革命取得彻底胜利的基本保证。
    中国赫鲁晓夫如此狂热地鼓吹“议会道路”，反对武装夺取政权，原因就在于害怕革命，害怕战争，害怕丢脑袋，只想舒舒服服地升官发财。这种家伙在监狱中，必然自首投敌，背叛革命；而在暴力革命面前，则又吓破了胆，竭力鼓吹合法斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫这种可耻的背叛活动，完全适应了美帝国主义和独夫民贼蒋介石溶共、灭共的需要，扑灭无产阶级革命、维护美蒋反动统治的需要。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所以狂热地鼓吹“议会道路”，还有一条理由，据说是因为当时中国出现了“历史上从来未有过的条件”。这些条件就是：世界上有三个国家（英、美、苏）援助中国的民主运动。中国有三个政党（国民党、共产党、民主同盟）要合作，使中国民主化。中国有三个主要阶级（劳动人民、中等资产阶级中间派、一部分大资产阶级）要求中国民主。这就是他要走“议会道路”的依据。
    真是一种奇谈怪论。在中国赫鲁晓夫的描绘下，美、英帝国主义竟然立地成佛了，他们竟然会援助起中国的“民主运动”来了。事实果真是如此吗？不！当时，美帝国主义的既定方针是要帮助蒋介石打内战，要把中国变为美国的附庸。美国政府用促进中国民主化作掩护，从各方面加强蒋介石的军事力量，并通过蒋介石的屠杀政策，镇压中国人民革命。中国赫鲁晓夫把美、英帝国主义也当作援助中国民主运动的力量，这不是认贼作父，完全彻底地站在美帝国主义一边了吗？
    三个政党“要合作”，三个阶级“要求中国民主”！这也是弥天大谎。大资产阶级和劳动人民，是绝对没有共同要求的。国民党、蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得。一九四五年八月，毛主席在《评蒋介石发言人谈话》一文中明确指出：蒋介石是人民公敌。可是，时隔半年，中国的赫鲁晓夫竟敢公然站在人民公敌一边，为蒋介石翻案，把人民公敌变成了人民，把杀人不眨眼的刽子手说成是“促进和平民主”的天使。这不又是完全彻底地充当蒋介石的代言人了吗？
    中国革命的实践，完全打破了中国赫鲁晓夫的迷梦。中国人民没有听信他的鬼话，而是在毛主席革命路线的指引下，经过三年的浴血奋战，终于推翻了国民党反动统治，赢得了解放战争的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。
    新中国成立后，中国赫鲁晓夫还不死心，仍然顽固地宣扬他这套投降主义的理论，并妄图把它推行到全世界。一九六二年，他要缅甸共产党“把武器埋起来，把军队改编成‘国防军’（奈温的反动军队）；和奈温合作，共同建设社会主义”。一九六三年四月，他在印尼访问时，还无耻地颂扬“纳沙贡”道路，在私下谈话中胡说，印尼共产党“在政府里有更多的人当部长有好处，可以多积累一些管理国家的经验”。
    这是中国赫鲁晓夫对中国人民的大叛卖，对亚洲人民的大叛卖，对世界人民的大叛卖。中国赫鲁晓夫是中国人民的公敌，也是世界人民的公敌。
    中国的“议会迷”彻底破产了。世界上大大小小的“议会迷”，也已到处碰壁。毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，正日益为全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族所掌握。武装斗争的烈火，在缅甸，在印度，在东南亚，在非洲，在拉丁美洲等地区，正在熊熊燃烧。他们正在用枪杆子批判旧世界，这也是对中国赫鲁晓夫的最有力的批判。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国最大的“议会迷”连同他所宣扬的一整套投降主义谬论，彻底批深批透，批倒批臭，统统把它扫进历史的垃圾箱。　（八月十日）
