Firmly Carry Out the Great Criticism

To launch a revolutionary great criticism is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao. It is a great call from the proletarian headquarters.

To launch a revolutionary great criticism is a devastating blow to the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. It is a powerful spiritual atomic bomb aimed at the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

To launch a revolutionary great criticism is to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the Party Central Committee, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat in a class struggle.

To launch a revolutionary great criticism is the great historical mission of the proletarian revolutionaries, and it is the most important task.

To launch a revolutionary great criticism is a new test for the proletarian revolutionaries.

Either you are a steadfast proletarian revolutionary, resolutely following Chairman Mao's words, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, acting swiftly and decisively, firmly and resolutely, determined to overcome interference, focusing the greatest class hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, organizing a mighty revolutionary army, and marching towards the bourgeois headquarters to launch a new wave of great criticism.

Or you are an unsteady revolutionary, slow to act and weak in measures, wavering and hesitant, stopping at the slightest interference, with much petty-bourgeois wavering and little proletarian steadfastness.

Or you fall behind the wheels of history, indifferent to the great criticism, but very interested in seizing positions, creating friction, and fighting "internal wars."

"One is not a hero until one reaches the Great Wall." Comrades of the revolutionary camp, let us resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee: All proletarian revolutionaries across the country, mobilize! Concentrate firepower, focus targets, and further deepen and broaden the political, ideological, and theoretical criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    坚定不移地抓大批判
    开展革命的大批判，这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是无产阶级司令部的伟大号召。
    开展革命的大批判，这是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的毁灭性打击，是投向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威力无比的精神原子弹。
    开展革命的大批判，这是保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级专政的阶级大搏斗。
    开展革命的大批判，这是无产阶级革命派的伟大历史使命，是压倒一切的中心任务。
    开展革命的大批判，是对无产阶级革命派的新的考验。
    或者是做坚定的无产阶级革命派，坚决听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，闻风而动，雷厉风行，坚定不移，下定决心，排除干扰，把最大的阶级仇恨集中在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人身上，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，杀向资产阶级司令部，掀起大批判的新高潮。
    或者是做不坚定的革命派，对待革命的大批判，行动迟缓，措施不力，动动摇摇，犹犹豫豫，一遇干扰，就停滞不前，小资产阶级的摇摆性甚多，无产阶级的坚定性极少。
    或者是掉在历史车轮的后边，对革命的大批判漠不关心，对争山头、闹磨擦、打“内战”却很感兴趣。
    “不到长城非好汉”。革命派的战友们，让我们坚决响应党中央的号召：全国无产阶级革命派动员起来，集中火力，集中目标，进一步深入地、广泛地从政治上、思想上、理论上，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，开展革命的大批判。（《浙江日报》八月二十六日社论）
