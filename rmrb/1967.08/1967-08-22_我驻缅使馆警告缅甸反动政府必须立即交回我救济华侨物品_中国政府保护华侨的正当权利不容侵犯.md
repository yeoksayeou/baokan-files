	Chinese Embassy in Burma Warns Burmese Reactionary Government to Immediately Return Relief Supplies for Overseas Chinese
	The Chinese Government's Right to Protect Overseas Chinese Cannot Be Violated

	BEIJING, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) — YANGON — The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 19, strongly protesting the Burmese reactionary government's arbitrary detention and attempted seizure of relief supplies sent by the Chinese government to overseas Chinese who have suffered from the persecution of Burmese fascist thugs.

	The note solemnly declared that the ownership of the 40 boxes of relief supplies sent by the Chinese government to Yangon belongs to China, and the Burmese government has no right to handle them. The Burmese government should immediately correct its arbitrary and unreasonable actions and hand over these relief supplies to the Chinese Embassy tax-free and without inspection for distribution to the suffering overseas Chinese.

	The note said that the Burmese reactionary government disregards the most basic principles of international relations, ignores repeated negotiations by the Chinese government, and arbitrarily deprives the Chinese government of its right to protect overseas Chinese. In the matter of the Chinese government sending relief supplies, it has carried out brutal interference and savage obstruction. However, you have not been able to come up with a single valid reason. All you keep repeating is that the Burmese government "in principle does not allow foreign governments and their institutions to import any goods for the benefit of their nationals." Here, we must ask: are the goods that the Chinese government is importing ordinary "goods"? No, they are relief supplies for overseas Chinese who have been driven to ruin and destitution by you. Since the Burmese reactionary government organized fascist thugs to arbitrarily burn, kill, capture, rape, and plunder overseas Chinese, why does the Chinese government not even have the right to send some relief supplies to the suffering overseas Chinese? After killing people, setting fires, and capturing people, and driving countless overseas Chinese to despair, you have so far refused to compensate the suffering overseas Chinese. In this situation, the Chinese government sent some relief supplies, and you came up with some "regulation" to obstruct it. Your arbitrary and unreasonable actions can only show that the Burmese reactionary government is deliberately cutting off the lifeline of the suffering overseas Chinese and that you are determined to kill them. Your actions of arbitrarily detaining and attempting to seize the relief supplies sent by the Chinese government further expose, in the eyes of the Burmese people who maintain traditional friendship with China and in the eyes of the revolutionary people of the world, your evil intentions to worsen Sino-Burmese relations, your stubborn anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese stance, and fully prove that you are a gang of lawless and unreasonable fascist bandits.

	The note said that the Chinese Embassy must indignantly point out that in the note from the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it actually took the threat of saying that according to the laws of the Union of Burma, the Burmese reactionary government can "seize" the relief supplies from China, and unreasonably demanded that the Chinese Embassy remove the relief supplies back to China by August 21, otherwise it would "deal with them." The Chinese Embassy strongly protests against the Burmese reactionary government's extremely brutal attitude.

	The note solemnly pointed out that if you ignore the serious warning of the Chinese government and dare to arbitrarily handle the relief supplies of the Chinese government, you must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences that may arise.

    我驻缅使馆警告缅甸反动政府必须立即交回我救济华侨物品
    中国政府保护华侨的正当权利不容侵犯
    新华社二十日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十九日照会缅甸外交部，就缅甸反动政府蛮横无理地扣押并企图没收中国政府救济遭受缅甸法西斯暴徒迫害的华侨的物品，向缅甸反动政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会严正声明：中国政府运抵仰光的四十箱救济品的所有权属于中国，缅甸政府根本无权处理。缅甸政府应该立即改正其蛮横无理的错误做法，把这些救济品立即免税免验交给中国大使馆向受难华侨分发。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府无视国际关系最起码的准则，不顾中国政府一再的交涉，无理剥夺中国政府保护华侨的正当权利，在中国政府运送救济品问题上进行粗暴的干涉和野蛮的阻挠。但是，你们却拿不出一条站得住脚的道理来，说来说去只是重复什么缅甸政府“在原则上不允许外国政府及其机构为其国民利益进口任何货物”。在这里，我们要质问你们：中国政府要进口的是一般“货物”吗？不是，是救济被你们逼得家破人亡、衣食无着的华侨的救济品。既然缅甸反动政府组织法西斯暴徒任意对华侨进行了烧、杀、捕、奸淫和掠夺，为什么中国政府连送些救济品给受难华侨的权利都没有呢？你们在杀了人、放了火、捕了人，逼得无数华侨走投无路以后，迄今拒绝对受难华侨作出抚恤和赔偿。在这种情况下，中国政府送了一些救济品来，你们又拿出一条什么“规定”来进行阻挠。你们这样蛮横无理，除了表明缅甸反动政府是蓄意断绝受难华侨的生路，除了说明你们决心置受难华侨于死地之外，还能意味着什么呢？你们，缅甸反动政府蛮横扣押和企图没收中国政府救济品的行动，在维护中缅传统友谊的缅甸人民面前，在全世界革命人民面前进一步暴露了你们蓄意恶化中缅关系，顽固反华排华到底的丑恶嘴脸，充分证明你们是一伙为所欲为、蛮不讲理的法西斯匪徒。
    照会说，中国大使馆必须愤慨地指出，在缅甸政府外交部的来照中，竟公然采取威胁手段，说什么根据缅甸联邦的法律，缅甸反动政府对中国的救济品“可以没收”，并无理限定中国大使馆在八月二十一日前把救济品运回中国，否则就“予以处理”。中国大使馆对缅甸反动政府这种极其粗暴的态度表示最强烈的抗议。
    照会严正指出，如果你们不顾中国政府的严重警告，竟敢擅自处理中国政府的救济物品，你们就必须对由此而引起的严重后果承担全部责任。
