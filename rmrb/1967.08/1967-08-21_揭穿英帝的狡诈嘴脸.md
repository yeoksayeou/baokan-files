British Foreign Secretary Brown, on August 16, at a press conference in Norway, brazenly declared that Britain is "determined to defend and protect our interests in Hong Kong," while also stating that Britain "intends to maintain relations with China" and "strive to improve relations." This is a typical counter-revolutionary two-faced tactic of the cunning and deceitful British imperialists.

According to Brown, British imperialism can both wield the butcher's knife in Hong Kong to brutally suppress our patriotic compatriots and also maintain and improve relations with China. What a convenient plan!

For over three months, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities have carried out horrifying suppression against our patriotic compatriots. You arbitrarily kill, arrest, and abduct our patriotic compatriots, recklessly destroy, attack, and loot our patriotic unions and organizations, illegally detain patriotic journalists, close down patriotic newspapers, and even severely politically persecute journalists from our Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong. This is intolerable! British imperialism in Hong Kong is bullying our compatriots and provoking the Chinese people so shamelessly. How can the Chinese people ignore this?

British imperialism not only suppresses our compatriots in Hong Kong but also continuously engages in armed provocations and creates incidents along the border. This inevitably leads to retaliation from our people. The Sha Tau Kok incident and the workers of Man Kam To and the farmers of Lo Wan striking back at the invading British forces in Hong Kong are just small lessons given to the British imperialists in Hong Kong.

Our government has repeatedly sent notes to the British government, strongly protesting and issuing serious warnings about the situation in Hong Kong. Yesterday, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the British government to withdraw the order to suspend the publication of three patriotic newspapers in Hong Kong within 48 hours, release the detained journalists, and withdraw the illegal lawsuits against patriotic newspapers and printing companies. It must also restore the normal operations of the persecuted newspapers and printing companies. The Chinese people once again sternly warn British imperialism: you must comply with this, otherwise, you will bear all the serious consequences that arise from it.

We want to tell Brown and his ilk: Hong Kong is Chinese territory, and our compatriots live there. You think you can separate the heinous crimes you have committed in Hong Kong from the issue of Sino-British relations? This is a pipe dream and absolutely impossible.

Although diplomatic representatives have been exchanged between China and Britain for more than ten years, due to the British government's consistent following of American imperialism, playing two-faced tactics, and fiercely anti-China, Sino-British relations remain in a semi-diplomatic state. Now, British imperialism is brutally suppressing our compatriots in Hong Kong. Isn't this an intentional attempt to completely destroy Sino-British relations?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The counter-revolutionary cause of the imperialist governments, though done every day, is always full of righteousness and morality in words, or at least somewhat righteous and moral, and never tells the truth. The cunning and deceitful British imperialism and a few other small imperialist countries are still like this today." This is a piercing exposure of the hypocritical and deceitful face of British imperialism.

We can clearly tell the British government: the great Chinese people firmly support the anti-British struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong. No matter how crazy and deceitful the British imperialists in Hong Kong are, they will absolutely not escape their ultimate doom!

    揭穿英帝的狡诈嘴脸
    本报评论员
    英国外交大臣布朗八月十六日在挪威举行的一次记者招待会上，一面狂妄地叫嚣什么“决心维护和保卫我们在香港的利益”，一面又说英国“打算”与中国“保持关系”，
  “并争取改善关系”。这是老奸巨猾的英帝国主义惯于玩弄的典型的反革命两面手法。
    按照布朗的说法，英帝国主义既可以在香港挥舞屠刀，血腥镇压我爱国同胞，又可以同中国“保持关系”，“并争取改善关系”。好一个如意的算盘！
    三个多月来，港英法西斯当局对我爱国同胞进行了骇人听闻的残暴镇压。你们随意屠杀、逮捕和绑架我爱国同胞，任意捣毁、袭击和抢劫我爱国工会和爱国机构，非法抓走爱国记者，封闭爱国报纸，以至对我新华社香港分社记者进行严重的政治迫害。是可忍，孰不可忍！英帝国主义在香港这样欺侮我国同胞，这样猖狂地向中国人民挑衅，中国人民岂能置之不理？
    英帝国主义在香港镇压我同胞，同时又不断地在边境进行武装挑衅，制造事端。这就不可避免地要遭到我国人民的反击。沙头角事件以及文锦渡工人和罗坊农民痛击港英侵略军，仅仅是中国人民给港英帝国主义的一点小小的教训而已。
    我国政府已经一再照会英国政府，就香港发生的情况，向它提出了最强烈的抗议和最严重的警告。昨天，我国外交部又正式照会英国政府，限令英国政府和港英当局在四十八小时内撤销对香港我三家爱国报纸的停刊令，释放被捕新闻工作者和撤销对爱国报纸和印刷公司的非法诉讼，并恢复受迫害的报纸和印刷公司的正常业务。中国人民再一次严厉警告英帝国主义，你们必须照此办理，否则，你们将要承担一切由此而引起的严重后果。
    我们要告诉布朗之流：香港是中国的领土，香港居住着我们的同胞，你们想把在香港犯下的滔天罪行，同中英两国关系问题分开，这是白日做梦，是绝对办不到的。
    虽然，中英双方互派外交代表已经十多年了，可是由于英国政府一贯追随美帝国主义，大耍两面手法，猖狂反华，所以中英关系至今仍然处于半建交状态。现在，英帝国主义又对我香港同胞实行疯狂镇压，这不是蓄意要彻底破坏中英两国的关系吗？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。老奸巨猾的英帝国主义及其他几个小帝国主义国家，至今还是如此。”这正是一针见血地揭穿了英帝国主义的虚伪狡诈的嘴脸。
    我们可以十分明确地告诉英国政府，伟大的中国人民对香港同胞的反英抗暴斗争，是支持定了的。不管港英帝国主义多么疯狂，多么狡诈，它绝对逃脱不了最后灭亡的命运！
