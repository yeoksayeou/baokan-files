There is a children's story about a man who slept for a hundred years. When he woke up, he couldn't understand why everything had changed so much; he thought he had only slept for one night!

The British colonialists in Hong Kong are much like this man in the story.

A hundred years ago, Britain was a powerful force in the world. It occupied many territories and boasted of being a "sun never sets" country. It sent a few warships to China, intimidated the corrupt Qing dynasty, and thus seized Hong Kong. To fill the safes of British colonialists with endless silver dollars, it used bayonets to force China to import opium from British India.

A hundred years later, the situation is completely different.

The worldwide anti-imperialist storm has already caused the old colonial system of the British Empire to crumble. The law of uneven development of capitalism, as taught by Marx and Lenin, has long since ruthlessly stripped Britain of its dominant position in the capitalist world, making it completely subservient to American imperialism.

The inherent antagonistic contradictions of capitalist society are becoming increasingly sharp, making the British economy extremely depressed and unstable.

Today, British imperialism is on its last legs!

Under these circumstances, to prevent the British working class from becoming politically aware, the British ruling class needs to set up a Labour Party government to represent its interests. The atrocities of the Labour government in Hong Kong fully expose the stupidity and brutality of British imperialism in its dying days. At the same time, the heroic struggle of Chinese workers in Hong Kong also inspires the fighting spirit of British workers. The Hong Kong incident is a good lesson for the British working class.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries in all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people."

The actions of the British government are like those of someone who has just woken up after sleeping for a hundred years and doesn't know that the world has undergone fundamental changes. It rages furiously, attempting to suppress the Chinese people of Hong Kong with brutal violence.

It seems to be unaware that the Chinese people and their patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have already armed themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

It tries to use brutal, fascist methods to suppress workers' resistance. It issues warlike threats, arrests Chinese journalists, searches schools and workers' organizations, and at the same time issues a series of decrees to maintain so-called "law and order."

For the British working class, these are important lessons.

The British ruling class widely propagates the so-called democratic rights and freedoms enjoyed by the British people. In fact, this democracy and freedom are false. Even these false democracies, once they become inconvenient for the ruling class, the ruling class can cancel them at any time.

To make British workers firmly believe that they are completely free, the British ruling class tirelessly tells them that under the socialist system, they would lose their freedom and be subjected to harsh dictatorship. They also say that in capitalist countries, workers' rights are "protected" by superclass laws.

In the past, these lies deceived many workers, but today's events in Hong Kong should help them further recognize the truth.

How great is the difference in democratic rights between the people in Hong Kong and those on the mainland of China! In Hong Kong, putting up big-character posters on the streets, marching, using loudspeakers, attending rallies, and shouting slogans are all crimes. On the mainland of China, proletarian democracy has never been seen on such a broad scale in human history—it is truly a blooming of a hundred flowers!

The contrast between bourgeois rule of law and proletarian rule of law is so striking!

The "authorities" in Hong Kong use the rule of law of imperialist colonial oppression, the rule of law of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie, to destroy the basic inalienable rights of the working class to resist exploitation and oppression. They destroy all freedoms and impose long-term imprisonment on those who dare to resist oppression. On the mainland of China, proletarian rule of law guarantees that tens of millions of working people have the right to rebel against everything that does not conform to their long-term interests and the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Today's struggle of Chinese workers in Hong Kong is also tomorrow's struggle of British workers.

Today's atrocities by the Hong Kong British reactionary police will also occur in Britain tomorrow.

The rotten British government recently announced that it is prepared to withdraw troops from some countries "east of Suez." At the same time, it shamelessly claims that it not only wants to maintain but also to greatly strengthen its military presence in Hong Kong.

Why, when the weakness of British imperialism is evident to all, does Hong Kong British imperialism adopt such provocative and arrogant postures? The reason is that they have a dual nature: on the one hand, they are extremely foolish in overestimating their own strength and underestimating the strength of the people; on the other hand, they have already sensed that their end is near, thinking that the best way to protect themselves is to take the offensive.

As Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." Hong Kong British imperialism recognizes that among the four million Chinese people in Hong Kong, more and more people are arming themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which seals the fate of Hong Kong British imperialism. Hong Kong British imperialism can hear the triumphant thunder of the great proletarian cultural revolution from the border to the east, and they are terrified.

Hong Kong British imperialism knows that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a great force to overthrow their cannibalistic rule. Therefore, they desperately try to exclude Mao Zedong Thought from the "paradise island," so that they can continue to reap the excessive profits they have long enjoyed.

Their plans are laughable and useless.

They will never succeed in isolating Mao Zedong Thought from the people, just as they cannot stop the waves of the sea.

The British colonialists are playing with fire and will burn themselves.

These people are not satisfied with oppressing the residents of Hong Kong; they even disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and people, providing Hong Kong to American aggressors as a base for their criminal aggression against Vietnam.

Their policies are completely contrary to the interests of the British people, and the British people will surely rise up to condemn and punish British imperialism.

Hong Kong under the rule of British imperialism is a den of sin, filled with the stench of decay and corruption of dying colonialism.

Hong Kong is part of China, and the future of Hong Kong lies with the great Chinese people, not with a small clique of colonialists.

### 香港前途决定于伟大的中国人民

    香港前途决定于伟大的中国人民
    英国　洪若诗
    有一个儿童故事讲到一个人睡了一百年，当他醒来时，他不能理解为什么事情完全变了样子，他以为自己仅仅睡了一夜！
    英国殖民者在香港的行径就和这个故事相仿。
    一百年以前，英国是世界上一支强大的力量。它霸占了许多领土，吹嘘自己是“日不落”国。它派遣了几艘军舰到中国，吓唬了腐败的清廷，就此攫取了香港。为了使源源不断的银元装满英国殖民主义者的保险箱，它用刺刀威逼中国输入来自英属印度的鸦片烟。
    一百年以后的今天，形势截然不同了。
    全世界风起云涌的反帝风暴已经使英帝国的旧殖民体系土崩瓦解。马克思列宁主义关于资本主义发展不平衡的规律的作用，早已无情地使英国失去了它在资本主义世界的霸主地位，而完全屈从于美帝国主义。
    资本主义社会所固有的对抗性矛盾不断尖锐化，使英国经济已经变成非常衰落和动荡不定。
    今天，英帝国主义已经奄奄一息了！
    在这种情况下，为了防止英国工人阶级在政治上觉醒起来，英国统治阶级就需要设立一个工党政府，来代表它的利益。工党政府在香港的暴行充分暴露了穷途末路的英帝国主义的愚蠢和凶恶。同时，香港中国工人的英勇斗争，也鼓舞着英国工人的斗志。香港事件，是对英国工人阶级上了很好的一课。
    毛主席教导我们：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    英国政府的行径正如它睡了一百年刚刚苏醒过来，还不知道世界已经发生了根本的变化。它暴跳如雷，企图以残酷的暴力来压服香港的中国人民。
    它好象并不知道中国人民和他们的香港爱国同胞已经用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来了。
    它想利用残暴的法西斯式的手段镇压工人的反抗。它发出好战的叫嚣，扣捕中国记者，查抄学校和工人组织，同时又颁布了一系列的法令来维护所谓“法律和秩序”。
    对英国工人阶级说来，这些都是重要的教训。
    英国统治阶级广泛宣传英国人民享受的所谓民主权利和自由。事实上，这种民主自由都是虚假的。即使这些虚假的民主，一旦使统治阶级感到不便，统治阶级就可以随时把它一笔勾销。
    为了使英国工人深信他们是完全自由的，英国统治集团毫不厌倦地对他们讲，在社会主义制度下，他们就会失去自由，要接受严酷的专政。还说，在资本主义国家工人的权利受到超阶级的法律的“保护”。
    过去，这些谎言欺骗过不少的工人，但是今天香港的事件，应该帮助他们进一步认识真理。
    在香港和中国大陆，人民的民主权利相差是多么大啊！在香港，在街上贴大字报，上街游行，使用扩音器，参加集会，呼喊口号，都是犯罪。在中国大陆，无产阶级的大民主在人类历史上从来没有见到过这样广泛的规模，真是百花盛开啊！
    资产阶级法治和无产阶级法治之间的对比，又是多么鲜明啊！
    香港“当局”用帝国主义殖民压迫的法治，英国垄断资产阶级的法治，破坏工人阶级抵抗剥削与压迫的起码的不可剥夺的权利。他们破坏一切自由，对那些敢于反抗压迫的人们判处长期的监禁。在中国大陆，无产阶级的法治保证了千百万劳动人民有权利对一切不符合他们长远利益的东西，不符合无产阶级革命事业的东西，进行造反。
    今天香港中国工人的斗争，也就是明天英国工人的斗争。
    今天港英反动警察的暴行，明天也会在英国发生。
    腐朽的英国政府最近被迫宣布，准备从“苏伊士以东”的一些国家撤军。同时，又厚颜无耻地声称，它不仅要保持而且还要大大加强在香港的驻军。
    为什么当英帝国主义的衰弱为目所共睹的时候，港英帝国主义要采取如此挑衅、狂妄的姿态呢？原因就是他们有两重性：一方面，他们是极端愚蠢地过高估计自己的力量，过低地估计了人民的力量；另一方面，它们已预感到末日快要来临，以为最好的保护办法就是以攻为守。正如毛主席教导我们的：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”港英帝国主义认识到在香港的四百万中国人民中间，愈来愈多的人，正在用战无不胜的毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，这一点就注定了港英帝国主义灭亡的命运。港英帝国主义听得见来自边境东面的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利雷鸣，他们感到丧魂落魄。
    港英帝国主义知道毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成推翻它们的吃人统治的伟大力量。所以他们就拚命地想把毛泽东思想排除在“港岛天堂”之外，以使他们能继续榨取他们长期以来一直享受的超额利润。
    他们的打算实在可笑之至，无用之极。
    他们想把毛泽东思想与人民隔离开来是万万不能得逞的，正如他们不能阻挡大海的浪潮一样。
    英国殖民主义者是在玩火，他们必将自焚。
    这些人还不满足于压迫香港居民，竟然不顾中国政府和人民的再三警告，把香港提供给美国侵略者，作为进行罪恶的侵越战争的基地。
    他们的政策完全与英国人民的利益背道而驰，英国人民一定会起来谴责和惩罚英帝国主义。
    港英帝国主义者统治下的香港，是一个罪恶的火坑，充斥着殖民主义的垂死的腐朽、堕落的臭气。
    香港是中国的一部分，香港的前途决定于伟大的中国人民，而不决定于一小撮殖民主义者。
