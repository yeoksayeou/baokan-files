Due to the defense of Ne Win by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, as well as China's Khrushchev, some people in certain regions of the world fail to see Ne Win's true face.

In fact, Ne Win is the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma.

Ne Win has long been implementing a policy of killing, looting, burning, and raping the revolutionary people.

Ne Win is the most brutal and treacherous reactionary ruler in Burmese history.

Look at his history, and you will know what kind of person he is.

Ne Win comes from a landlord family and is a filial and virtuous descendant of the landlord class.

He is a member of the reactionary political group, the Ba Maw faction.

Before the Second World War, the Ba Maw faction reached an agreement with Japanese fascism and sent Ne Win to Hainan Island for military training.

Before the Japanese fascists invaded Burma, they sent Ne Win to infiltrate Burma for espionage activities.

When the Japanese fascists brutally ruled Burma, Ne Win was an important figure in the Burmese army. From then on, Ne Win began to build the "Ne Win faction," using nationalist sentiments to win over a group of political and military figures.

While building the "Ne Win faction," Ne Win also joined the infamous "People's Revolutionary Party" led by Ba Swe and U Saw.

From then on, Ne Win began to plot to establish his rule in Burma.

On the other hand, the Burmese Communist Party began to prepare for resistance against Japan as soon as the Japanese imperialists joined the Second World War.

After the Japanese imperialists entered Burma, the Burmese Communist Party sent people to infiltrate the Burmese army. At that time, Ne Win mixed into the anti-Japanese ranks. However, Ne Win exposed his class nature during the anti-Japanese period. It is more accurate to say that he was anti-communist rather than anti-Japanese, and he did so to a frenzied extent.

When Japan surrendered and British imperialism re-entered Burma, Ne Win was an officer of a regiment in the Burmese army established by the British, working with the British.

At that time, because they could not bear the oppression of the British Empire, members of the peasant associations led by the Burmese Communist Party staged armed uprisings in some areas.

The peasant uprising army made the British Empire tremble with fear, and the British elite troops that participated in the Second World War could not suppress these uprising armies.

Ne Win, following the orders of the British Empire, commanded his troops to suppress the peasant uprising army in central Burma.

Ne Win arrested large numbers of peasants and imprisoned them in concentration camps surrounded by barbed wire. There were no shelters from the wind and rain in the concentration camps, and the peasants were imprisoned there day and night, sleeping on the ground, enduring the scorching sun and rain, and suffering inhuman torture. Some peasants were even killed.

Large numbers of members of the Burmese Communist Party's semi-military organization, the "Red Guards," were massacred. The official white guerrilla forces, with Ne Win's encouragement and instigation, massacred large numbers of Red Guards.

At that time, Ne Win again used his usual tactics, trying to cover his blood-stained hands with velvet gloves and trying to conceal his class revenge with sweet words.

However, the Burmese Communist Party and the people saw through Ne Win; he was the chief culprit in the massacre of peasants.

Ne Win's troops also tried to sabotage the historic peasant conference in central Burma. Before and during the conference, he sent troops to threaten the peasants. However, we successfully held the historic peasant conference.

After the assassination of Bo Aung San in 1947, Ne Win was transferred to Rangoon to work in the military department of the British governor.

At this time, Ne Win finally found an opportunity to collude with the Socialist Party and try to obtain the position of commander-in-chief of the army.

In 1948, an internal war broke out.

The instigators of the internal war were the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and a group of officers led by Ne Win, who were representatives of domestic and foreign reactionary forces.

The Burmese army, established by the British, under the command of the British military advisory group, massacred the people and turned the country into a sea of fire. Ne Win and his gang were particularly enthusiastic in this event.

At the height of the internal war, Ne Win, who could best serve imperialism and feudal landlords, became the commander of the reactionary Burmese government army, controlling the army as the pillar of the reactionary regime. However, this army was still under the control of the British military advisory group.

In 1949, Ne Win climbed to the positions of vice-premier, minister of defense, and minister of the interior. In 1954, the British military advisory group was forced to withdraw from Burma under the strong opposition and condemnation of the Burmese Communist Party and the masses.

In 1958, the bourgeois ruling clique that ruled Burma split, with the Nu faction continuing to rule. In the same year, Ne Win seized Nu's power, resulting in a situation where the bourgeois ruling clique was divided into three factions. The split of the ruling clique was mainly due to their inability to eliminate the armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party and their encounter with political and economic crises. At this time, the bourgeoisie, in order to maintain its rule, openly played its most brutal card and established a military dictatorship.

The Ne Win military dictatorship repeatedly declared that it would "eradicate the Burmese Communist Party root and branch." They arrested countless progressive individuals, writers, and opposition figures and sent them to the island of Coco, far from the Burmese mainland, for inhuman torture. Therefore, the history of Coco Island is well known to the Burmese people.

The Ne Win military dictatorship forcibly turned many villages into concentration camps. They forced some villages to relocate to remote places and arbitrarily arrested and massacred those they suspected of being "communist sympathizers." Many people were beaten to death with sticks, many women were raped, or driven out of the village, or sent to do hard labor.

Ne Win also raised a large number of military spies, who had all received specialized training in West Germany, the United States, Britain, "Malaysia," Australia, and other reactionary countries. They directly or indirectly controlled the cruel fascist methods used by the Japanese fascists during their rule in Burma, such as waterboarding, electric shock torture, and various methods of physical torture. They even drove the interrogated to madness or mental disorder. Many detainees were killed under the false charge of "escape."

Ne Win once issued an order to the army: do not bring back live prisoners. Therefore, many comrades who were unfortunately captured in battle were brutally killed. In one battle, a comrade fell into the enemy's hands, and the enemy cut off his ears and nose, gouged out his eyes, and finally buried him alive. Former Central Committee member of the Burmese Communist Party, Colonel Thakin Than Tun, was captured while crossing an enemy-occupied area and was tortured to death by the enemy. Thakin Than Tun was a good soldier of the party. The enemy dared not publish the truth about the killing of Thakin Than Tun; they lied in the newspapers, saying that Thakin Than Tun was killed in battle.

The following figures show the degree of brutality with which the reactionary Burmese government persecuted the people.

From the start of the internal war in 1948 to 1957, the executioners who ruled Burma killed more than 30,000 people in ten years. The number of injured, imprisoned, and crippled by torture is countless. A total of 3,016 villages were destroyed, burned, and forcibly relocated.

In order to maintain their rule in another way, the bourgeoisie handed over power to Nu again in 1960, but it was short-lived. In 1962, Ne Win took over the power again.

Soon after taking office in 1962, on July 7, Ne Win massacred more than 100 students at Rangoon University. In this massacre, more than 300 students were injured, and more than 400 were arrested. The student union building of Rangoon University, which has important significance in the history of Burma's anti-imperialism, was also blown up.

In this student massacre, Ne Win again used his usual tactics, dressing himself up as an uninvolved, upright figure. However, the people of the whole country knew that Ne Win was the chief culprit in the massacre of students.

The running dog of imperialism, the number one traitor of Burma

In the early days of Ne Win's rule in 1962, he took some pseudo-anti-imperialist measures and seized some enterprises of imperialism. However, these tactics could not cover up his reactionary true face.

He not only acknowledged the loans borrowed by previous governments from the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries but also continued to accept loans. These included more than 200 million Burmese kyats from U.S. imperialism, more than 110 million Burmese kyats from the World Bank, 135 million marks from West Germany, and 140 million dollars from Japan, etc.

It is well known that all loans from U.S. imperialism are conditional. U.S. imperialism openly stated that if the money is not used according to its plan, it will not give the loan. Therefore, Ne Win's continued acceptance of U.S. loans and "aid" further exposed his true face as a loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism.

The Burmese people know that Ne Win not only received U.S. aid but also received large quantities of military supplies from British imperialism and the Indian reactionaries on many occasions.

The Burmese people also know that Ne Win received political support and various "aid" from the Khrushchev traitor clique.

The Burmese people also know that Ne Win is closely colluding with the Japanese and Israeli reactionaries to brutally oppress and exploit the Burmese people.

Ne Win's relationship with the Thai reactionary government, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, is also very close. The Burmese people and the people of the whole world know that the Thai government has sheltered the Kuomintang bandits and incited them to invade Burma. However, Ne Win maintains friendly relations with the Thai government. At the time when the Kuomintang bandits were massacring the Burmese people, the Ne Win clique was playing friendly golf matches with Thai government officials. The big speculator group can freely enter and exit the Thai-Burmese border and easily drive Burma's elephants and cows to Thailand.

Ne Win knows that the Thai government has sheltered the leaders of the anti-Ne Win faction and provided military training to many of its members in Thailand, allowing them to cross the Thai-Burmese border and engage in armed activities in Burma.

However, Ne Win still maintains close relations with the Thai government and continues to act as a running dog of U.S. imperialism.

This phenomenon is not surprising; it is a common occurrence among the loyal running dogs of imperialism. For example, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam was a die-hard running dog of U.S. imperialism until he was killed by U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism has always been selfish and harmful to others. No matter how much service its running dogs have provided in the past, once it finds that this running dog can no longer serve it, it will use every means to eliminate it and replace it with a new running dog.

To replace the running dog, U.S. imperialism often openly raises new running dogs. In Thailand, to replace Phibun Songkhram, it raised Sarit.

For the same purpose, U.S. imperialism is now openly supporting the running dogs who fled to Thailand—the national traitors of Burma. When necessary, it will use them to replace Ne Win. Ne Win is aware of this.

Therefore, in order to act as the most loyal running dog of the United States, to gain further trust from U.S. imperialism, Ne Win has done everything that is most reactionary and evil.

At the same time, Ne Win also held secret talks with the national traitors of Burma who fled to Thailand.

Ne Win's relations with the Suharto and Nasution fascist clique of Indonesia and the running dogs of British imperialism in "Malaysia" are also quite close.

In order to deceive the Burmese people and the people of the world, Ne Win pretends that his foreign policy is a policy of "neutrality."

How can Ne Win, who accepts U.S. loans, implement a policy of neutrality? In the Vietnam issue, isn't Ne Win's real position the position of the United States?

Isn't it Ne Win who prohibits the Burmese people from aiding Vietnam and opposing the United States?

In the Middle East incident, Ne Win does not dare to stand on the side of the invaded Arab people.

Ne Win fabricated the fascist atrocities of crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese, brutally killing Chinese residents and Chinese experts, which is a thorough exposure of the fascist counter-revolutionary face of the Ne Win military government.

This is Ne Win's so-called "neutral policy." Now, the signboard of false neutrality of the Ne Win regime has completely and thoroughly collapsed.

The Burmese people must overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma—Ne Win!

The Burmese rulers have been waging an anti-communist and anti-people internal war for nearly twenty years. The Ne Win military government is fighting with almost all the ethnic minorities in Burma, with twelve ethnic minorities engaged in armed struggles.

Under this military government, even bourgeois "democracy" does not exist. In 1963, the Ne Win regime arrested more than a thousand progressive individuals, students, and teachers in the white areas and imprisoned them. All political parties and progressive mass organizations were disbanded. They also restricted the Burmese people from going abroad, especially to the People's Republic of China. During this anti-China period, Ne Win closed the only progressive newspaper in the white areas—The People's Daily.

The Ne Win military government used the pretext of "nationalization" and other pseudo-socialist slogans to plunder the people greedily, especially to squeeze the peasants to the bone, causing the countryside to collapse.

Due to the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the Ne Win military government, Burma has experienced an unprecedented reduction in rice production in its history. Under these circumstances, Ne Win, based on his policy of exploiting and opposing the people, did not consider the issue of leaving enough rice to meet domestic needs and continued to implement the policy of exporting hunger.

Today, the Burmese people are facing famine and serious economic difficulties. Even the soldiers of the Ne Win army are not exempt, as their salaries are not enough to maintain their lives. Many people have to pawn things in the pawnshop before the next month's pay, while those government officials and officers are mostly corrupt officials.

The Burmese people clearly know that only by completely eradicating and burying imperialism and the feudal landlord system can a new country be built; only by thoroughly overthrowing the Ne Win clique, which represents the interests of the landlord bureaucratic bourgeoisie, can a peaceful and prosperous country be built. The people also clearly know that all reactionary class governments must be thoroughly overthrown and a new people's democratic government established. This is the strong demand of the people from their real lives. Therefore, the people's democratic government led by the Burmese Communist Party, which the people yearn for and fight for, will definitely be realized.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has had an extremely great impact on the Burmese revolution led by the Burmese Communist Party—the main force to win this great victory. This is an extremely important factor in the victory of the Burmese revolution.

The most important thing of all is that the Burmese Communist Party has highlighted the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and gained the support of the broad masses. Therefore, the Burmese revolution will definitely achieve victory.

U.S. imperialism and all imperialisms' aggression and interference in Burma will be defeated!

The interference of the traitor Kautsky's disciple, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin, in Burma will be defeated!

The Burmese people will definitely capture Ne Win and bring him to the people's court for trial!

Overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma—Ne Win!

    打倒缅甸的蒋介石——奈温！
    缅甸　温昂
    由于赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫和柯西金，以及中国的赫鲁晓夫都替奈温辩护，因此，世界上有些地区的人民，看不清奈温的真面目。
    事实上，奈温是缅甸的蒋介石。
    奈温长期以来就执行了对革命人民的杀光、抢光、烧光、奸淫掳掠的政策。
    奈温是缅甸历史上最残暴、最阴险的反动统治者
    看一看他的历史，就知道他是一个什么样的人。
    奈温出身于地主家庭，是地主阶级的孝子贤孙。
    他是缅甸反动政客巴盛集团分子。
    第二次世界大战以前，巴盛集团同日本法西斯达成协议，把奈温派到海南岛接受军训。
    日本法西斯侵入缅甸以前，派奈温潜入缅甸进行间谍活动。
    日本法西斯残暴统治缅甸的时候，奈温是缅甸军队的一名重要人物。从那时起，奈温就开始建立“奈温派”，他利用民族情绪拉拢一批政界和军界的人物。
    奈温在建立“奈温派”的同时，又参加了臭名昭著的巴瑞、觉迎领导的“人民革命党”。
    从那时起，奈温就阴谋在缅甸建立他的统治了。
    另一方面，缅甸共产党从日本帝国主义参加第二次世界大战的时候起，就开始准备抵抗日本。
    日本帝国主义进入缅甸后，缅甸共产党就派人打进缅甸军队进行工作。当时，奈温混入了抗日队伍。但是，奈温在抗日期间又暴露了他的阶级本质。与其说，他是在抗日，倒不如说他是在反共，并且达到了疯狂的程度。
    日本投降，英帝国主义重新进入缅甸的时候，奈温是英国建立的缅甸军队中一个营的军官，同英国人共事。
    当时，因为不愿忍受英帝的压迫，缅甸共产党领导下的农会会员在一些地区举行了武装起义。
    农民起义军使英帝怕得发抖，参加第二次世界大战的英国精锐部队镇压不了这些起义军。
    奈温按照英帝的命令，指挥他的部队镇压了缅甸中部的农民起义军。
    奈温大批逮捕农民，把农民关在用铁丝网圈起来的集中营。集中营里没有可遮风雨的房子，农民日夜被囚在那里，睡在地上，忍受日晒雨淋，而且还要受到灭绝人性的摧残，有些农民则遭到杀害。
    缅甸共产党的半军事组织——“红卫队”的成员大批被害。官办的白色游击队在奈温的纵容和唆使下大批杀害红卫队。
    当时，奈温又施用惯技，企图用丝绒手套掩盖他那沾满农民鲜血的双手，企图用花言巧语掩饰他那阶级报复的本质。
    但是，缅甸共产党和人民看透了奈温，他就是屠杀农民的罪魁祸首。
    奈温的部队还企图破坏威震敌人的缅甸中部农民大会。在大会以前和大会期间，他派出部队四出活动，威胁农民。但是，我们胜利地召开了具有历史意义的农民大会。
    一九四七年波昂山被杀以后，奈温被调到仰光，在英国总督的军部工作。
    这时候，奈温终于找到机会勾结社会党，企图捞取全军司令的职务。
    一九四八年爆发了内战。
    内战的挑起者是自由同盟的领导人和以奈温为首的一批军官，他们是国内外反动势力的代表人物。
    由英国建立起来的缅甸军队，在英国军事顾问团的指挥下，大肆屠杀人民，把全国变成了一片火海。在这事件中，奈温及其一伙是十分卖力的。
    就在内战激烈的时刻，最能替帝国主义、封建地主效劳的奈温，当上了反动的缅甸政府军的司令官，掌握了作为反动政权支柱的军队。但是，这支军队实际上仍然处在英国军事顾问团的控制之下。
    一九四九年，奈温爬上副总理、国防部长和内政部长的位置。一九五四年，英国军事顾问团在缅甸共产党和人民群众的剧烈反对和谴责下，被迫撤回了。
    一九五八年，在缅甸实行暴政的资产阶级统治集团发生了分裂，由努派继续执政。同年，奈温夺了努的权，这样，就出现了资产阶级统治集团分成三派的局面。统治集团的分裂，主要是由于他们难以消灭缅共的武装力量，并且，遇到了政治和经济危机。这时，资产阶级为了维护其政权，便公开施出最凶暴的一招，成立军事独裁政府。
    奈温军事独裁政府一再叫嚣，对缅甸共产党要“斩草除根”。他们逮捕了无数进步人士、进步作家和反对派人士，送到远离缅甸本土的海岛——果果岛囚禁，进行灭绝人性的虐待，因此，果果岛的历史为缅甸人民所熟悉。
    奈温军事独裁政府强行把许多乡村变成了集中营，他们强迫一些村庄迁到遥远的地方，他们用最残酷的办法任意逮捕和屠杀他们认为有“通共”嫌疑的人。不少人被他们用棍子活活打死，许多妇女遭到奸污，或被驱逐出村，或被送去服苦役。
    奈温还豢养一大批军事侦探，这些家伙都曾在西德、美国、英国、“马来西亚”、澳大利亚等反动国家受过专门训练，他们直接或间接地掌握了日本法西斯统治缅甸时所运用的那一套残酷的法西斯手段，诸如用灌水逼供、电刑审讯，或用各种方法摧残肉体等等，都是他们采用的最普通的刑罚。他们甚至把受审者逼疯或折磨到神经错乱。不少被捕者被他们加上“逃跑犯”的莫须有罪名而遭杀害。
    奈温曾对军队下了一道命令：不准带回活的俘虏。因此，许多在战斗中不幸被俘的同志惨遭杀害。在一次战斗中，有一位同志落入虎口，敌人就割他的耳朵和鼻子，挖他的眼睛，最后把他活埋了。前缅共中央委员漆岗少校，在一次穿越敌占区时不幸被俘，敌人把他活活地折磨死了。漆岗少校是党的好战士。敌人不敢公布杀害漆岗少校的事实真相，他们在报纸上撒谎说，漆岗少校是在战斗中击毙的。
    关于反动透顶的缅甸政府迫害人民的残酷程度，通过下列一些数字便可见一斑。
    从一九四八年内战开始到一九五七年的十年中，统治缅甸的刽子手共屠杀了三万余人，受伤者、被捕入狱、惨遭酷刑以致残废者不计其数。遭破坏、焚烧和迫迁的村庄共计三千零十六个。
    资产阶级为了以另一种方式继续维持其统治，一九六○年奈温又将政权交给了努，但是为时不长。一九六二年奈温再次接管了政权。
    他上台后不久，在一九六二年七月七日那一天，就枪杀了仰光大学一百多名学生，在这次大惨案中，有三百多学生受伤，四百多人被捕，并炸毁了在缅甸反帝历史上具有重要意义的仰光大学学生会大楼。
    在这次屠杀学生的惨案中，奈温又耍了他惯用的手法，把自己打扮成与惨案无关的、正直的人物，但是，全国人民清楚地知道奈温是屠杀学生的罪魁祸首。
    帝国主义的走狗，缅甸的头号卖国贼
    奈温在一九六二年上台初期，采取了一些假反帝的措施，没收了帝国主义的一些企业。但是，这些手法并不能遮盖其反动真面目。
    他不仅承认了历届政府向美、英等帝国主义国家所借的贷款，而且还继续接受贷款。其中包括美帝国主义二亿多缅元、世界银行一亿一千多万缅元、西德一亿三千五百万马克和日本的一亿四千万美元等等。
    众所周知，美帝国主义的一切贷款，都是附有条件的。美帝国主义公开声称，若不按它的计划使用就不给贷款。因此奈温继续接受美国贷款和“援助”，就更加暴露了他是美帝国主义忠实走狗的真面目。
    缅甸人民知道，奈温不仅得到美援，而且还曾经从英帝国主义和印度反动派那里多次得到大量的军事物资。
    缅甸人民也知道，奈温还得到赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团的政治上的支持和各种“援助”。
    缅甸人民也知道，奈温还同日本、以色列反动派紧密勾结残酷压迫和剥削缅甸人民。
    奈温同美帝国主义的走狗，泰国反动政府的关系也很密切。全缅甸人民和全世界人民都了解，泰国政府收容了蒋匪军，并唆使他们侵犯缅甸。但是，奈温却同泰国政府保持友好关系。正当蒋匪军残杀缅甸人民的时候，奈温之流却同泰国政府的官员心平气和地进行高尔夫球友谊比赛。大投机商人集团，可以随便在泰缅边境进出，也可以轻而易举地将缅甸的大象和牛赶到泰国去。
    奈温心里明白，泰国政府收容了反奈温派的头头，并且在泰国对他们中间的许多成员进行军事训练，还让他们越过泰缅边界，进入缅甸搞武装活动。
    可是，奈温仍然同泰国政府保持密切的关系，继续充当美帝国主义的走狗。
    这种现象不足为奇，这是帝国主义忠实走狗之间常有的现象。例如，南越的吴庭艳，死心塌地充当美帝国主义的走狗，直至被美帝国主义杀掉为止。
    美帝国主义一向都是损人利己的。不管它的走狗过去如何为它效劳，一当它发现这条走狗不能继续为它效劳的时候，它就千方百计地把他除掉，而换上新的走狗。
    为了更换走狗，美帝国主义往往公开豢养新走狗。在泰国，它为了取代銮披汶，它就豢养了沙立。
    为了同样的目的，美帝国主义现在公开扶植跑到泰国去的走狗——缅甸的民族败类。必要时它将用他们来代替奈温。这一点奈温是清楚的。
    因此，奈温为了充当美国最忠实的走狗，为了取得美帝国主义对他的进一步信任，他干尽了一切最反动的坏事。
    同时，奈温还同跑到泰国去的缅甸民族败类进行了秘密会谈。
    奈温同印度尼西亚的苏哈托、纳苏蒂安法西斯集团，同英国帝国主义的走狗“马来西亚”的关系也是相当密切的。
    奈温为着欺骗缅甸人民和世界人民，佯称他的外交政策是什么“中立政策”。
    接受美国贷款的奈温，怎么能够实行中立政策呢？在越南问题上，奈温的真正立场，不就是美国的立场吗？
    不正是奈温禁止缅甸人民进行援越反美吗？
    在中东事件中，奈温根本不敢站在被侵略的阿拉伯人民一边。
    奈温制造了疯狂反华排华的法西斯暴行，残暴地杀害华侨和中国专家，这是奈温军人政权法西斯反革命面目的彻底大暴露。
    这就是奈温的所谓“中立政策”。现在，奈温政权的这块假中立的招牌已经完全彻底地破产了。
    缅甸人民一定要打倒缅甸的蒋介石——奈温
    缅甸统治者进行反共反人民的内战，迄今已经将近二十年了。奈温军人政府，正在同缅甸几乎所有的少数民族打仗，共有十二个少数民族进行了武装斗争。
    在这个军人政府统治下，连资产阶级“民主”都没有。一九六三年，奈温政权在白区共逮捕了上千名进步人士、学生和教师，并把他们投入监狱。解散所有的政党和进步群众团体。还限制缅甸人民出国，尤其不许到中华人民共和国。就在这次反华期间，奈温封闭了在白区的唯一的进步报纸——《人民报》。
    奈温军人政府利用“国有化”等假社会主义的幌子对人民进行贪得无厌的掠夺，特别是对农民进行敲骨吸髓的榨取，使农村陷于破产。
    由于奈温军人政府反动的内外政策的结果，缅甸出现了历史上空前未有的大米减产现象。在这种情况下，奈温根据其剥削人民和反人民的政策，丝毫也不考虑留下足够的大米供应国内需要的问题，继续实行饥饿输出。
    今天，缅甸人民面临着饥荒，遇到了严重的经济困难。甚至连奈温军队的士兵也不例外，他们的薪饷不足于维持生活，很多人不得不在下个月发饷前，去当铺当东西，而那些政府官员和军官则大都是贪官污吏。
    缅甸人民清楚地知道，只有完全根除并彻底埋葬帝国主义和封建地主制度，才能建设崭新的国家；只有彻底打倒代表地主官僚资产阶级利益的奈温集团，才能建设和平、繁荣的国家。人民也清楚地知道，必须彻底打倒一切反动阶级的政府，建立一个新的人民民主政府。这是人民群众从他们的现实生活中发出的强烈要求。因此，人民群众渴望并为之奋斗的、由缅甸共产党领导的人民民主政府一定能够实现。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，对缅甸共产党——争取赢得这一伟大胜利的主力军——领导的缅甸革命，产生了极其巨大的影响。这是缅甸革命胜利的极为重要的因素。
    千条万条，最重要的一条，就是缅甸共产党突出了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，获得了广大人民的拥护。因此，缅甸革命必定能够取得胜利。
    美帝国主义和一切帝国主义对缅甸的侵略和干涉必败！
    叛徒考茨基的门徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金对缅甸的干涉必败！
    缅甸人民必将活捉奈温，并提交人民法庭审判！
    打倒缅甸的蒋介石——奈温！
