More than 500 representatives attending the Beijing Garrison Command's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works held a denunciation and criticism meeting today against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the class enemies. They exposed the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

These soldiers of Chairman Mao, who have made significant contributions to defending Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have also achieved outstanding results in the "three supports, two militaries" work. In their speeches, they pointed out: One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. Chairman Mao issued the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, which has great historical significance. It lifted the lid on the struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters within the Party, pointing out the main direction of struggle for the revolutionary masses and providing an extremely powerful ideological weapon. Chairman Mao's big-character poster is the battle cry and mobilization order to smash the bourgeois headquarters. We must follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, carry out the great criticism, and resolutely and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

At the meeting, the representatives used a large amount of facts to expose and criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. Representative Wang Zhaolong said: Our army was established under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's line of building the army. The great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army and the fundamental guarantee that our army will never change its nature. In our era, no matter who it is, no matter how high their position or how long their tenure, as long as they oppose Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will fight them and let them be crushed by the wheels of history. Zhao Hongsheng, the political instructor of a certain unit's Red First Company, who participated in the crossing of the Dadu River and the Battle of Pingxingguan and has many battle merits, pointed out: Chairman Mao's military thought is the most complete, most scientific, and most great military theory. Whenever we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we progress, develop, and win; whenever we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, we weaken, retreat, and fail. He said that the forty-year battle history of his company once again proves the truth of Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The gun is our lifeline, and armed struggle is the only way to seize power.

At the meeting, the representatives unanimously expressed that they would follow the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. They would firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, making the army forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In any situation, they would be loyal to the people with a sincere heart, unchanging like the dried-up river and weathered stones, and steadfastly be the pillars of the proletarian dictatorship. They would temper themselves in the great winds and waves of class struggle and achieve new merits in completing the glorious tasks given by Chairman Mao to defend the motherland and the "three supports, two militaries."

    北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表
    愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫一伙的罪行
    新华社七日讯　正在出席北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的五百多名代表，今天怀着对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱和对阶级敌人无比仇恨的心情，举行了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派声讨批判大会，大力揭发了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿的滔天罪行，满腔热情地歌颂了八届十一中全会的伟大成果，歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    这些毛主席身边的战士，在保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，作出了重大贡献；在“三支”“两军”的工作中，也作出了优异成绩。他们在发言中指出：一年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开了党的八届十一中全会，毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报，这是具有伟大的历史意义的，它揭开了党内无产阶级司令部与资产阶级司令部斗争的盖子，给无产阶级革命派指出了斗争的主攻方向，提供了威力无比的最强大的思想武器。毛主席的大字报是摧毁资产阶级司令部的进军号和动员令。我们要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，搞好革命大批判，坚决彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    会上，代表们用大量的事实，揭发和批判了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿的罪恶。代表王兆龙说：我军是在毛泽东思想哺育下，按照毛主席的建军路线建立起来的新型的人民军队。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是我军的灵魂，是我军永不变质的根本保证。在我们的时代，不管他是谁，不管他地位多高，资格多老，只要他反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就和他拚，让他被历史的车轮辗得粉碎。曾经参加过强渡大渡河、平型关大战屡建战功的某部红一连指导员赵洪升指出：毛主席的军事思想是最完整、最科学、最伟大的军事学说，什么时候按照毛泽东思想办事，就进步，就发展，就胜利；什么时候背离了毛泽东思想，就削弱，就倒退，就失败。他说，从我连的四十年的战斗历史，再一次证明了毛主席教导的“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，枪杆子是我们的命根子，武装斗争是夺取政权的唯一道路。
    会上，代表们一致表示，遵循林副主席的教导，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，使我军永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，在任何情况下都赤胆忠心为人民，海枯石烂不变心，坚定不移地做无产阶级专政的柱石。要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，锻炼自己，在完成毛主席交给的保卫祖国和“三支”“两军”的光荣任务中建新功。
