The counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Lusheng is a great schemer and a great plotter. He is the agent of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party within the military, a "time bomb" planted in our army. Together with the big clique leader Peng Zhen, the big academic clique leader Lu Dingyi, and others, they formed a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. With the support of the Khrushchev in China, they frantically opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Vice Chairman Lin, who is Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, and opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought. For a long time, he has been dreaming day and night of seizing military power, overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieving a counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism.

In January 1964, Ro Lusheng arbitrarily decided to hold a nationwide military competition, which was a major exposure of his plot to seize military power and oppose the party.

The Great Military Competition is the continuation of the struggle between two military lines under new conditions.

Under what circumstances did Ro Lusheng launch the Great Military Competition?

At that time, our great leader Chairman Mao made a brilliant summary of the situation: both domestic and international situations have improved and are on the right track. It can be predicted that greater developments will come. The situation of the world revolution is like this, and the situation of our socialist revolution and socialist construction is also like this. The situation of our military construction is also like this.

Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the Military Commission, he has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively applied Mao Zedong Thought, proposed and emphasized the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the prominence of proletarian politics, the implementation of the Four Firsts, the promotion of the Three-Eight Style, the practice of the Three Great Democracies, and the launch of the Four Good Units movement, etc., a series of policies and measures to strengthen the revolutionary construction of our army. In 1960, at the expanded meeting of the Military Commission chaired by Vice Chairman Lin, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line was criticized and rectified, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" was formulated. This resolution inherited and carried forward the tradition of the "Gutian Conference" in 1929, summarized the rich experience of army building and political and ideological work since the liberation under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, pointed out the direction of our army's political work in the new historical period, and became a new milestone in the army's forward march.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The Four Firsts are good, this is a creation. The ideological and political work and military work of the PLA, after Comrade Lin Biao proposed the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, have developed greatly compared to the past, becoming more concrete and more theoretical.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and under the leadership of Vice Chairman Lin, our army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and entered a new historical period. "Study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," "definitely study Mao Zedong Thought thoroughly," became the unanimous action of the broad cadres and soldiers of our army. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, millions of new people of communism have grown up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and other heroes are the outstanding representatives of our army in this new historical period. The construction of our army in various aspects can be predicted to develop even greater.

Just as our army was advancing victoriously, the great schemer and plotter Ro Lusheng turned red-eyed and anxious. He sensed that the entire army was studying Chairman Mao's works intensively, emphasizing proletarian politics, and would thoroughly bury the bourgeois military line. If he did not quickly come out to block and brake, it would be even more difficult to realize his wolfish ambition to seize military power.

Thus, he raised the tattered flag of Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line again, inherited Peng Dehuai's mantle, and in January 1964, he used his usurped position to decide on a nationwide military competition behind the backs of the Central Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin, openly opposing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. From January to October, he went to various places thirteen times to supervise the competition, frantically promoting the military competition, attempting to impact Chairman Mao's military line and the series of policies and measures for the revolutionary construction of our army formulated by Vice Chairman Lin.

Ro Lusheng's malicious intent in promoting the military competition was to replace Chairman Mao's proletarian military line with a bourgeois military line and to use bourgeois ideology to reform our army. Through the military competition, he emphasized military first, technology first, to impact proletarian politics, to impact the study of Chairman Mao's works, to degrade and weaken our army's political and ideological work. In a word, he wanted to remove the soul of our army—the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to politically disintegrate our army, to change the proletarian nature of our army, to make our army degenerate and change color, and to become a tool for his plot to seize military power and oppose the party.

However, a mere arm cannot stop the forward march of the historical wheel, but can only be crushed to pieces.

The essence of the Great Military Competition is to oppose Chairman Mao's military thought.

Our army is personally created by Chairman Mao and is fundamentally built on politics. As early as the initial period of our army's creation, Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively solved the relationship between politics and military affairs, emphasizing that politics should command military affairs, and military affairs must be subordinate to politics. Chairman Mao has always taught us: politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. Without the correct political standpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul.

In the history of our army, the struggle between the two military lines has always been about whether politics should command military affairs or military affairs should command politics, whether politics should be first or military affairs should be first, whether politics should be prominent or military affairs should be prominent. This is the focus of the struggle between the two military lines.

The forty years of our army are the forty years of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line continuously defeating the bourgeois military line. Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, Gao Gang, Rao Shushi, Peng Dehuai, and other representatives of the bourgeois military line all jumped out at critical moments in history to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. However, these historical clowns were all swept into the historical garbage dump by the iron broom of the revolutionary people.

Ro Lusheng is another representative of the bourgeois military line. The military competition he launched is the continuation of the struggle between the two military lines under new conditions, a ferocious attack by the bourgeois military line on Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

Ro Lusheng openly opposed Chairman Mao's principle of political construction of the army. He maliciously advocated that "politics should be combined with military affairs" and "ideas should be combined with actions." In 1964, in his long speech at the military training meeting of the island defense forces, he did not mention studying Chairman Mao's works or Mao Zedong Thought being in command, but only mentioned Mao Zedong Thought once, saying that it should be combined with military training. He peddled the junk of the simple military viewpoint everywhere, saying that whether military training is good or not is the standard to check whether the Four Firsts are implemented. He completely denied the commanding position of political work, shouting that political work should "penetrate into military training" and "ensure military training." He wanted our army's political work to not grasp the fundamentals, not grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, not grasp the ideological transformation of people, but to play a role in "ensuring military training" and to turn political work into something subordinate to military affairs.

Ro Lusheng completely denied that the greatest combat effectiveness of our army is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary soldiers who are armed with high political awareness with Mao Zedong Thought; instead, he advocated that "weapons plus technology" is the greatest combat effectiveness. He said: "We have airplanes and cannons, and if we can shoot accurately and operate them, that is the combat effectiveness of the army and we can win the battle," "military technology is the most solid and most powerful thing." He even wanted our army to learn the actions of the martial arts team and the acrobatics of the circus troupe. He said: "Why do acrobats have the courage? It is because they have martial arts, and the more skilled they are, the bolder they are." During the period when the military competition was prevalent, Ro Lusheng rushed east and west, spreading poison everywhere. He wanted our troops to specially practice "climbing walls and roofs," "walking on wires," and "climbing ice slopes." He wanted to turn the great People's Liberation Army into a troupe without Mao Zedong Thought and without proletarian politics.

On the issue of war preparation, Ro Lusheng completely denied that the primary preparation of our army is political and ideological preparation and the preparation of Chairman Mao's military thought. He insisted on calling "military training" the "most important preparation." At the Nanjing on-site meeting where he launched the military competition, he frantically said: "To prepare for war, for the army, to do well in military training is the most important and specific preparation." When he visited the "elite" performance in the Beijing Military Region, he said again: "To train the troops to be like today's 'elite,' this is the most practical, most important, and most effective preparation for us to prevent imperialist aggression and safeguard national security." This is openly opposing Vice Chairman Lin. Vice Chairman Lin said: We defeat the enemy, "the most important factor is the political factor, the factor of the people, the factor of political work in the troops, the factor of party leadership, the factor of public sentiment and military morale. This is the most important factor in defeating the enemy in war, not the second, third, or fourth, no matter what, this is the most important factor." He said: "In the past, we fought wars relying on politics, the ten-year civil war was like this, the War of Resistance Against Japan was like this, the War of Liberation and the Korean War were also like this, and in the future, we will still rely on politics to win battles." Ro Lusheng, under the pretext of caring about military training, actually denied the truth that all our victories come from the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought from the root. Ro Lusheng talked a lot about "war preparation," as if he cared about our country's security, but it was just a cover. The "war preparation" he talked about was actually his preparation to seize military power and oppose the party. In his words, using military prominence to oppose political prominence, removing the soul of our army, this is his "most important and specific preparation" to seize military power and oppose the party.

At the end of 1964, Vice Chairman Lin gave instructions to emphasize politics and severely criticized the errors of the military competition, hitting Ro Lusheng's vital point. Ro Lusheng hated and feared this to death, and dared to change Vice Chairman Lin's instructions eight times in ten days, using the method of opportunism to stuff in many of his private goods. Vice Chairman Lin said that the nationwide military competition impacted politics and that the wind should be stopped immediately. Ro Lusheng said that it was only once in a decade that a competition was held, and the positive significance was the main thing, and the spirit could be boosted but not released. Vice Chairman Lin said that military training, production, etc., could occupy a certain amount of time, but should not impact politics, and on the contrary, politics could impact others. Ro Lusheng said that this was about what was necessary and could not be rushed. Vice Chairman Lin said that military training should be compressed and politics should be emphasized. Ro Lusheng said that it should not be biased to one side and then to the other side. This counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Lusheng, frantically opposing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, was indeed audacious and deserved to die a thousand deaths!

Ro Lusheng, to resist Vice Chairman Lin's criticism of the military competition, also used the method of opportunism, that is, opportunism, to raise the "red flag" to oppose the red flag.

In the article "State and Revolution," Lenin criticized opportunism and said: "When Marxism is secretly changed into opportunism, it is easiest to deceive the masses by disguising opportunism as dialectics." Ro Lusheng did just that.

Ro Lusheng often said a few words about "emphasizing politics" in many occasions, fearing that others would hear the words about emphasizing politics, and then immediately followed with a long speech after "but," loudly shouting to "emphasize military affairs." Look at his clever use of the word "but": He said: "If politics is not done well, everything else will not be done well; but if politics is done well alone, everything else will be bad and collapse, such politics cannot be called politics, it is empty politics, where is such politics!" "If politics is not done well, when fighting, you will run away; but if military affairs have no skills, when fighting, the enemy will rush over, will you run away or not?" "If politics is done well, other work will be guaranteed; but the work of politics in command has achieved results, it does not mean that other work is also done well." "To grasp the commanding things...; but in the arrangement of work, what to do first and what to do later, it depends on the specific situation." "Politics is the main thing; but if you can't shoot accurately and operate, that's not good either." And so on, the list goes on. From these "buts," it can be seen that Ro Lusheng opposed what and emphasized what, is it not clear? What he chopped off after "but" is not precisely the soul of our army!

Ro Lusheng also spread the fallacies of "military is politics," "military and politics should be equally important," "military and politics should be emphasized alternately," etc., everywhere. However, you can't cover up the truth with opportunism, Ro Lusheng's stubborn resistance to Vice Chairman Lin's two-faced tactics was exposed. His crime must be thoroughly settled!

The Great Military Competition concealed a shocking class struggle.

Ro Lusheng promoted the military competition, opposed emphasizing politics, and advocated military first, technology first. Was it that he did not want politics? Not at all! He opposed emphasizing proletarian politics precisely to emphasize bourgeois politics and to reform our army with a bourgeois appearance. The military competition was a cover, and its essence was political struggle. Under the cover of the military competition, there was a shocking class struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "Politics, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, are class struggles of class against class, not the behavior of a few individuals."

Vice Chairman Lin also said: "In class society, all major political events are class struggles."

The military line serves the political line. The Khrushchev in China has long stubbornly promoted a bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to restore capitalism in China. From Peng Dehuai to Ro Lusheng, the bourgeois military line they insisted on is to serve the bourgeois reactionary line and is an important component of the bourgeois political line. Our army is the main tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party always regard our army as their sworn enemy. To restore capitalism, they must do everything possible to sabotage and corrupt the army, attempting to make our army degenerate and change color. Ro Lusheng's launch of the military competition in 1964 was to serve this political purpose.

The resolution of the expanded meeting of the Military Commission chaired by Vice Chairman Lin in 1960 pointed out: "For a revolutionary army, any powerful enemy, any weapon with great power, is not to be feared; what is truly to be feared is political decline, alienation from the masses, disarmament of ideology, slackness, and even loss of fighting will."

This great schemer Ro Lusheng was precisely the one who launched a ferocious attack on our army on this crucial issue. Politically, he promoted the granting of official positions and material incentives, attempting to induce some people to pursue fame and wealth, and used bourgeois tactics to corrupt the army. When he came to the Beijing Military Region to inspect, he told the soldiers of a "model" class: "You work hard, I see that your class will not only produce a few generals in the future, but may also produce a marshal or two." He "encouraged" the soldiers to "strive to become battalion commanders, regimental commanders, division commanders." The military competition seriously damaged the style of our army and ruined its fine traditions.

Ro Lusheng attempted to disintegrate and transform our army politically, ideologically, and organizationally through the military competition. However, Ro Lusheng's calculations were wrong, and his beautiful dream was shattered. Our army is the people's army personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, an armed force of workers and peasants that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, whoever dares to scheme against our People's Liberation Army, will ultimately be met with a bloody nose. Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of our army. The sea can dry up, and the stones can rot, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! Our heads can be cut off, and our blood can flow, but the great Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned! We will defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian military line to the death. It is easy to shake the mountains, but it is difficult to shake the People's Liberation Army. We will thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Lusheng, criticize him deeply and thoroughly, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of his bourgeois military line, making him infamous forever and never allowing him to rise again!

    大比武是罗瑞卿篡军反党阴谋的大暴露
    北京部队机关无产阶级革命派
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，是一个大野心家、大阴谋家，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在军内的代理人，是埋在我军的一颗大“定时炸弹”。他同大党阀彭真、大学阀陆定一等，结成了反革命修正主义集团，在中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持下，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想。长期以来，他日夜梦想的就是篡夺军权，颠覆无产阶级专政，实现资产阶级的反革命复辟。
    一九六四年一月，罗瑞卿擅自决定全军大比武，就是他篡军反党阴谋的大暴露。
    大比武是两条军事路线斗争在新条件下的继续
    罗瑞卿的大比武是在什么形势下搞起来的呢？
    当时的形势，我们伟大领袖毛主席作了这样英明的概括：国内外形势均已向好，均已走上正确的轨道。可以预计，更大的发展是会到来的。世界革命的形势是这样，我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的形势也是这样，我们军队建设的形势同样也是这样。
    林副主席主持军委工作以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造性地运用毛泽东思想，提出和强调了活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等加强我军革命化建设的一系列方针、原则和重大措施。一九六○年，在林副主席主持的军委扩大会议上，集中地批判和清算了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线，制定了《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》。这个决议继承和发扬了一九二九年“古田会议”的传统，在毛泽东思想指导下，全面地总结了解放十一年来军队建设和政治思想工作的丰富经验，明确地指出了在新的历史时期中我军政治工作的方向，成为我军前进道路上的一个新的里程碑。
    毛主席指出：四个第一好，这是个创造。解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。
    在毛主席的无产阶级军事路线的指引下，在林副主席的率领下，我军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，满怀革命豪情，跨进了一个崭新的历史时期。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”，成为我军广大干部战士的一致行动。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，千万个共产主义的新人，象雨后春笋一样茁壮地成长起来。雷锋、欧阳海、王杰等英雄人物，就是我军在这个新的历史时期的优秀代表。我军各方面的建设，可以预计，更大的发展是会到来的。
    就在我军胜利前进的大好形势下，大野心家、大阴谋家罗瑞卿，红了眼，着了急。他预感到全军上下大学毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，将要彻底埋葬资产阶级军事路线，再不赶快出来挡道煞车，要实现他篡夺军权的狼子野心，那就更困难了。
    于是，他重新扯起了彭德怀资产阶级军事路线的破旗，继承了彭德怀的衣钵，在一九六四年一月，他利用窃踞的要职，背着中央军委，背着林副主席，擅自决定要搞全军大比武，公然和林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的指示相对抗。从一月至十月，他先后十三次到各地坐阵督战，疯狂推行大比武，妄图冲击毛主席的建军路线，冲击林副主席制定的我军革命化建设的一系列方针和政策。
    罗瑞卿推行大比武的恶毒用心，是妄图以资产阶级军事路线代替毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，用资产阶级思想来改造我们军队。通过大比武，大搞军事第一，技术第一，以此冲击无产阶级政治，冲击毛主席著作的学习，贬低和削弱我军的政治思想工作。一句话，就是妄图抽掉我们军队的灵魂——伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，从政治上瓦解我军，改变我军的无产阶级性质，使我军变质变色，成为他篡军反党的工具。
    但是，螳臂挡车，丝毫不能阻挡历史车轮的前进，而只能被碾得粉碎。
    大比武的实质是反对毛主席的建军思想
    我军是毛主席亲手缔造的，是以政治建军为根本的。早在我军创建初期，毛主席就天才地创造性地解决了政治和军事的关系，强调政治统帅军事，军事必须服从政治。毛主席一向教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。
    在我军历史上，两条军事路线的斗争，从来都是围绕着政治统帅军事还是军事统帅政治、是政治第一还是军事第一、是突出政治还是突出军事这个根本问题进行的。这是两条军事路线斗争的焦点。
    我军的四十年，就是毛主席无产阶级军事路线不断地战胜资产阶级军事路线的四十年。王明、张国焘，高岗、饶漱石、彭德怀等这些资产阶级军事路线的代表人物，在历史的关键时刻都跳了出来，和毛主席的无产阶级军事路线相对抗。但是这些历史的小丑，都一个个被革命人民的铁扫帚扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
    罗瑞卿是资产阶级军事路线的另一个代表人物。他抛出的大比武，是两条军事路线斗争在新条件下的继续，是资产阶级军事路线向毛主席的无产阶级军事路线发动的一次猖狂进攻。
    罗瑞卿公然反对毛主席关于政治建军的原则。他别有用心地鼓吹“政治要和军事结合”，“思想要和动作结合”。一九六四年，他在守岛部队军事训练会议上的长篇讲话中，闭口不谈学习毛主席著作，不谈毛泽东思想挂帅，只一处提到毛泽东思想，还胡说“要同军事训练结合”。他到处贩卖“军事好，政治自然会好，军事不好，政治也不会好”的单纯军事观点的破烂货，说什么军事训练好不好，“是检验四个第一是否落实的标准”。他根本否认政治工作的统帅地位，叫喊政治工作“要渗透到军事训练中”，“要保证军事训练”。妄图使我军的政治工作不抓根本，不抓学习毛主席著作，不抓人的思想革命化，而单纯起“保证军事训练”的作用，把政治工作变成从属于军事的东西。
    罗瑞卿根本否认我军最大的战斗力是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的有高度政治觉悟的革命战士；而鼓吹“武器加技术”就是最大的战斗力。他说：“我们有飞机大炮，再加上打得准，开得动，就是军队的战斗力，就能打胜仗”，“军事技术是最过硬、最厉害的东西”。他甚至要我们军队学习武术队的动作，学习马戏团的杂技。他说：“杂技演员为什么胆子大？就是因为他们有武艺，艺高人胆大。”在大比武风行期间，罗瑞卿东奔西跑，到处放毒。他要我们部队专门练“爬墙上房”、“飞檐走壁”的动作，练习“踩钢丝”、“爬冰坡”的绝技。妄图使伟大的人民解放军，变成一支没有毛泽东思想的、没有无产阶级政治的杂技队。
    在战争准备这个问题上，罗瑞卿根本否认我军的战争准备首要的是政治思想的准备，是毛主席军事思想的准备，他硬要把“军事训练”说成是“最重要的准备”。就在他抛出大比武的南京现场会议上，猖狂地说：“要战争准备，作为军队来说，搞好军事训练，乃是最重要、最具体的准备。”他在北京部队参观“尖子”表演时又说：“把部队都练成象今天的‘尖子’这个样子，这就是我们防止帝国主义侵略、保卫祖国安全的最实际、最重要、最有效的准备。”这是公开地和林副主席唱反调。林副主席说：我们战胜敌人，“最重要的是政治的因素，是人民的因素，部队中政治工作的因素，党的领导的因素，是民心军心的因素，这是战争中打败敌人的诸因素中最重要的因素，不是第二个、第三个、第四个，无论如何，这个是最主要的因素。”又说：“我们过去打仗是靠政治打胜的，十年内战是这样，抗日战争是这样，解放战争和赴朝抗美作战也是这样，今后也还是要靠政治打胜仗。”罗瑞卿打着关心军事训练的幌子，实际上从根本上否认我军的一切胜利都来源于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个真理。罗瑞卿大讲特讲“战争准备”，似乎关心我国的安全，其实只是个外衣。他所说的“战争准备”，实际是他篡军反党的准备。在他说来用突出军事反对突出政治，抽掉我军的灵魂，这乃是他篡军反党的“最重要、最具体的准备”。
    一九六四年底，林副主席作了突出政治的指示，严厉地批评了大比武的错误，击中了罗瑞卿的要害。罗瑞卿对此恨的要死，怕的要命，竟然狗胆包天，大肆篡改林副主席的指示，在十天之内就篡改了八次之多，以折衷主义的手法，塞进了他的许多私货。林副主席说，全军大比武冲击了政治，要赶快煞住这股风。罗瑞卿却说，十几年才搞了一次比武，积极意义是主要的，气可鼓，不可泄。林副主席说，军事训练、生产等可占用一定的时间，但不应冲击政治，相反，政治可以冲击其它。罗瑞卿却说，这里是指必要的，也不能乱冲一气。林副主席说，要把军事训练压缩一下，要突出政治。罗瑞卿却说，不要一下偏到这边，一下又偏到那边。罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子，疯狂对抗林副主席指示，真是胆大包天，罪该万死！
    罗瑞卿为了抗拒林副主席对大比武的批评，还采取折衷主义即机会主义的手法，打着“红旗”反红旗。
    列宁在《国家与革命》这篇文章里批评折衷主义的时候说：“把马克思主义偷偷地改为机会主义的时候，用折衷主义冒充辩证法是最容易欺骗群众的。”罗瑞卿就是这样干的。
    罗瑞卿在许多场合，常常是小声说了一句“突出政治”的话之后，唯恐别人把突出政治的话听去了，于是，紧接着就在“但是”后面大作文章，高声大喊要“突出军事”。请看他对“但是”二字的妙用：他说：“政治搞不好，别的就搞不好；但是，如果单纯把政治搞好，别的都不好，垮下来，这种政治恐怕不能算政治，是空政治，那里有这种政治！”“政治搞不好，打起仗来向后跑；但是，军事没有一点功夫，打起仗来，人家扑过来，你说向不向后跑？”“政治搞好了，其他工作就有了保证；但是政治挂帅的工作做出了成绩，并不等于别的工作也做好了。”“要抓紧挂帅的东西……；但是，在工作安排上那些先做那些后做，要看具体情况。”“政治是主要的；但是，如果打不准，开不动，那也不行。”等等等等，不一而足。从这些“但是”中可以看到，罗瑞卿反对什么，强调什么，不是很清楚么？被他在“但是”后边砍掉的不正是我军的灵魂么！
    罗瑞卿还到处散布“军事就是政治”，“军事政治应该并重”，“军事政治同等重要”，“军事政治要轮流突出”等谬论。但是，纸里包不住火，折衷主义遮盖不了铁的事实，罗瑞卿顽固对抗林副主席的两面手法被戳穿了。他的这笔罪行一定要彻底清算！
    大比武掩盖着惊心动魄的阶级斗争
    罗瑞卿推行大比武，反对突出政治，提倡军事第一，技术第一，是不是他不要政治呢？完全不是！他反对突出无产阶级政治，就是为了突出资产阶级政治，用资产阶级面貌来改造我们军队。大比武是外衣，它的实质是政治斗争。在大比武的外衣下，掩盖着惊心动魄的阶级斗争。
    毛主席说：“政治，不论革命的和反革命的，都是阶级对阶级的斗争，不是少数个人的行为。”
    林副主席也说：“在阶级社会里，凡是带政治性的大事，就是阶级斗争。”
    军事路线是为政治路线服务的。中国的赫鲁晓夫长期以来顽固地推行一条资产阶级反动路线，妄图在中国实行和复辟资本主义。从彭德怀到罗瑞卿，他们所坚持的资产阶级军事路线，就是为资产阶级反动路线服务的，是资产阶级政治路线的一个重要组成部分。我军是无产阶级专政的主要工具。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，总是把我军看成死对头。他们为了复辟资本主义就要千方百计地破坏和腐蚀军队，妄图使我军变质变色。罗瑞卿在一九六四年抛出大比武，就是为这个政治目的服务的。
    一九六○年林副主席亲自主持制定的军委扩大会议决议这样指出：“对于革命军队来说，任何强大的敌人，任何威力巨大的武器，都是不可怕的；真正可怕的，是在政治上衰退，脱离人民群众，思想上解除武装，松懈以至丧失战斗意志。”
    罗瑞卿这个大野心家，正是在这个要害问题上向我军发动猖狂进攻的。在政治上，他大搞封官许愿、物质刺激，妄图引诱一些人追求名利地位，极力用资产阶级手腕腐蚀军队。他来北京部队参观时，向一个“尖子”班的战士们说：“你们好好干吧，我看将来你们班，不仅可以出几个将军，还可能出个把元帅。”他“鼓励”战士们“努力争取”“当营长，当团长，当师长”。大比武严重地破坏我军的作风，败坏我军的优良传统。
    罗瑞卿妄图通过大比武，从政治上、思想上、组织上，全面地瓦解我军，演变我军。但是，罗瑞卿的如意算盘打错了，他的黄粱美梦破灭了。我军是毛主席亲自缔造、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队，是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的工农武装。谁敢反对毛主席，谁敢反对毛泽东思想，谁敢暗算我们人民解放军，到头来只能使他碰得头破血流。毛主席是我军的最高统帅。海可枯，石可烂，我们忠于毛主席的红心永不变！头可断，血可流，伟大的毛泽东思想永不丢！我们誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级军事路线。撼山易，撼解放军难。我们要把反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他的资产阶级军事路线的流毒，叫他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
