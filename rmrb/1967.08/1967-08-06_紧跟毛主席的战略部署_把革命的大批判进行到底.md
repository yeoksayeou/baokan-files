Our great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," which has great historical significance, exposes the bourgeois headquarters within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and calls on us to aim at this counter-revolutionary black headquarters and fire heavily.

Chairman Mao's theories, policies, and guidelines for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are great contributions to Marxism-Leninism. In over a year of practice in the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people have clearly recognized that the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev is the most dangerous enemy of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. They control part of the state machinery and part of the Party, government, and military power. Once the time is ripe, they will, like Khrushchev in the Soviet Union, stage a counter-revolutionary coup and turn the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. Through the Cultural Revolution, by smashing this bourgeois headquarters, we have eliminated the greatest hidden danger in our country.

After more than a year of intense revolutionary struggle, the proletarian revolutionary factions have pulled down the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, making them the object of universal condemnation. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

However, this handful of great conspirators and great schemers will never willingly retreat from the stage of history, and the closer they are to death, the more fiercely they will struggle. China's Khrushchev's current stubborn resistance shows that he still dreams of regaining the "paradise" he has lost. In the past, this fellow's influence was far-reaching, controlling many departments. He long pursued a bourgeois reactionary line, spreading poison widely and deeply in politics, economics, culture, and the military. He can still use his remaining influence to launch a fierce counterattack against us. Therefore, we proletarian revolutionary factions must not relax our vigilance, must not underestimate the enemy, and must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating a fallen enemy to the ground." We must launch a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing, exposing, and overthrowing China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has shaken the world, was personally initiated and led by our greatest leader Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is our guide for carrying out the Cultural Revolution. In our revolutionary criticism, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works well and closely follow all of Chairman Mao's deployments and instructions. Let us advance bravely under the great banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and strive for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    紧跟毛主席的战略部署  把革命的大批判进行到底
    贵州省革命委员会副主任委员　张明
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的《炮打司令部》这张具有伟大历史意义的大字报，揭露了长期隐蔽在党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，号召我们对准这个反革命的黑司令部，猛烈开炮。
    毛主席制定的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、方针、政策，是对马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献。在一年多来文化大革命的实践中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众清楚地认识到，以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，是我国无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人。他们掌握了一部分国家机器，一部分党权、政权、军权，一旦时机成熟，他们就会象苏联的赫鲁晓夫那样搞反革命政变，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。通过文化大革命，摧毁了这个资产阶级司令部，就消除了我们国家的一个最大的隐患。
    经过一年多轰轰烈烈的革命斗争，无产阶级革命派把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派拉下马来，使他们处于“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的可耻境地。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利！
    但是，这一小撮大阴谋家、大野心家，决不会甘心退出历史舞台，而且他们越临近死亡，就越要做垂死挣扎。中国的赫鲁晓夫目前的负隅顽抗，正说明他还在梦想恢复已经失去的“天堂”。过去，这个家伙的手伸得很长，控制了不少的部门。他长期推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，在政治、经济、文化、军事等各条战线上，流毒甚广，影响不浅。他还可以利用他力所能及的影响，向我们进行疯狂的反扑。因此，我们无产阶级革命派绝不能松懈斗志，绝不能轻敌，应当发扬“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，更广泛更深入地开展革命的大批判，把中国的赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭。
    这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的，毛泽东思想是我们进行文化大革命的指南。我们在革命的大批判中，要很好地活学活用毛主席著作，要紧跟毛主席的一切部署和指示。让我们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，奋勇前进，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利吧！
