Father and Mother Are Dear, but Chairman Mao Is Dearer

Beijing Garrison Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works Xiao Xigui

The Party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer. Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao inscribed a message for the Beijing Garrison Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Conference. This is the greatest care, the greatest trust, the highest demand, and the greatest encouragement for us. This is a great joy in the political life of all officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison, and it is also a great joy in the political life of our entire army. We cannot help but raise our arms and shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

Our Vice Chairman Lin Biao is the same as our great leader Chairman Mao, always caring for revolutionary soldiers, always with us heart to heart, the most intimate person, the closest person to revolutionary soldiers. Ten thousand words and a million pens cannot express our excitement, ten thousand sheets of paper cannot write down our boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao.

What is the happiest thing in the world? Being born in the great era of Mao Zedong is the happiest. What is the most glorious thing in the world? Defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most glorious. We are the guards who stand day and night by Chairman Mao's side, the loyal defenders of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the loyal defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, we have received the intimate care of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, Premier Zhou, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, feeling the utmost glory and happiness. We must resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We must concentrate our forces, concentrate our targets, concentrate our firepower, and thoroughly criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically! We vow to defend Chairman Mao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death! Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we revolutionary soldiers will be close to him; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will resolutely fight him! Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely overthrow him!

    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲
    北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子　萧锡奎
    天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅为北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会题词，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的信任，最高的要求，最大的鼓舞。这是北京卫戍区全体指战员政治生活中的一件大喜事，也是我们全军政治生活中的一件大喜事。我们不禁振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    我们的副统帅林彪同志，同我们伟大领袖毛主席一样，最关心革命战士，和我们永远心连心，是我们革命战士最知心的人，最亲近的人。千言万语也表达不完我们内心的激动，千支笔万张纸也写不尽我们对伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的无限热爱。
    世界上什么最幸福？生长在伟大的毛泽东时代最幸福。世界上什么最光荣？保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最光荣。我们是日夜守卫在毛主席身边的警卫战士，是毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线的忠实捍卫者，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者。今天，我们受到毛主席、林副主席、周总理和中央文革的亲切关怀，感到无尚光荣，无尚幸福。我们一定要最坚决地贯彻执行林副主席的最新指示：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”我们要集中力量，集中目标，集中火力，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判，彻底打倒！誓死保卫毛主席，保卫中央文革！谁拥护毛主席，我们革命战士就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，我们就坚决和他拚！谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决打倒谁！
