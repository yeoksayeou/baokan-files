The great Chinese people are not to be insulted; all anti-China elements will meet a bad end. Forty thousand revolutionary masses in the capital hold a demonstration to condemn the atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries.

Revolutionary masses shout: "Down with Suharto-Nasution!" "The Indonesian people will win, the Indonesian reactionaries will be defeated!"

New China News Agency, August 7th: Forty thousand Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the capital continued to hold a grand demonstration today, angrily condemning the new atrocities committed by the fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution.

Red Guards and revolutionary students from colleges and universities, as well as middle schools in the capital, revolutionary workers from various industries such as industry, transportation, urban construction, and finance and trade, cadres from central and municipal government agencies, and revolutionary residents from neighborhoods, have been pouring into the area in front of the Indonesian Embassy from morning to evening. The demonstrators carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, held copies of the little red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and waved red flags, forming a massive tide that roared with thunderous shouts: "Down with Suharto-Nasution!" "The Indonesian people will win, the Indonesian reactionaries will be defeated!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia!"

The heroic Red Guards of the capital pointed out: The Indonesian reactionary government, in order to completely destroy the diplomatic relations between the two countries, has now further stirred up an anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people countercurrent. What goes around comes around; they will reap what they sow and hasten their own doom. The Red Guards posted big-character posters on the wall of the Indonesian Embassy, stating: The Indonesian reactionaries attempt to intensify anti-China sentiment to divert the Indonesian people's resistance against the reactionaries and ease the sharp class struggle, but this will not succeed. The various persecutions the reactionaries inflict on the revolutionary people will only promote a broader and more intense revolution. Some middle school Red Guards angrily denounced: A few bad guys like Suharto and Nasution actually instructed thugs to tear up the portrait of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao. This is absolutely intolerable. We solemnly declare: We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We have the courage and confidence, together with the people of our motherland and the revolutionary people of Indonesia, and all revolutionary people around the world, to plant the red flag all over the world. All devils will be annihilated!

The revolutionary workers of the capital said during the demonstration: History will surely give the Indonesian reactionaries, this group of anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people clowns, a shameful ending! We, the working class of the capital, firmly support the just struggle of our brave and tenacious red diplomats and patriotic overseas Chinese! We firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people! We must warn Suharto, Nasution, and a few other reactionaries: You cannot escape punishment for your bloodbath in the Thousand Islands! The great Indonesian people will surely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Indonesia, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow your rule, and expose you, this small group of tyrants!

The broad masses of cadres in the capital said during the demonstration: Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the dreams of imperialism and all reactionaries to restore capitalism in China, powerfully supporting and inspiring the revolutionary people of the world and promoting the revolutionary movements of various countries. The Chinese people are a great people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Republic of China is a proletarian dictatorship state tempered by the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese people are not to be insulted! The People's Republic of China is not to be insulted! All anti-China elements will not have a good ending!

The revolutionary youth of the Indonesian Students' Union in China also participated in the demonstration today. They posted big-character posters in Chinese and Indonesian on the wall of the Indonesian Embassy: "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of Indonesia!" "Hang Suharto! Hang Nasution!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "The road of Mao Zedong is the only road to victory for the Indonesian revolution!" "The Indonesian people will win, the Indonesian reactionaries will be defeated!" "Long live the Communist Party of Indonesia!" A poster signed "Chairman Mao's revolutionary little generals" read: "Only by waging people's war can the Indonesian reactionaries be annihilated!" The revolutionary little generals of the Indonesian Students' Union in China wrote in a letter of protest, full of revolutionary passion: Our most, most great leader Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people firmly support the armed revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. We, the revolutionary youth of Indonesia, in the spirit of internationalism, firmly support the Chinese Red Guards, and together with the Red Guards, thoroughly criticize and sweep away the capitalist roaders within the Party like Khrushchev. We firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, steadfastly defend the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, defend the Communist Party of China, and fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries!

The revolutionary masses of the capital have reached a new climax in their demonstrations to protest the new atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries. The vast procession shows the high degree of patriotism and internationalism of the revolutionary people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.
