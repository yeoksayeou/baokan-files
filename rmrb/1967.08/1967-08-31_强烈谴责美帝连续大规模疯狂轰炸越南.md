The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement firmly supporting the principled stance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam. It strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' continuous large-scale mad bombing of Vietnam. The Chinese people are willing to make the greatest national sacrifices to fully support the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors. The collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to force Vietnam into "peace talks" and the Soviet revisionists' plot to directly intervene in South Vietnam to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. fully expose the Soviet revisionist leadership as the U.S. imperialists' number one accomplice, whose guilt is undeniable.

New China News Agency, August 30th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on August 30th, strongly condemning the recent large-scale bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by U.S. imperialism and its collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership to play the trick of "bombing to force peace." The statement emphasizes: The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are willing to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S., determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

August 30, 1967

Recently, the U.S. imperialists have escalated their bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to an even more frenzied level. American air pirates have been conducting large-scale bombings of the capital city of Hanoi, attacking transport lines, the Red River dikes, and areas near the Sino-Vietnamese border such as Lao Cai. They have also dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb areas north of the demilitarized zone. In particular, since August 21st, American aircraft have been conducting indiscriminate bombing of the city and suburbs of Hanoi, causing severe losses to the lives and property of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese government and people express utmost indignation and strong condemnation of this! The blood debts that U.S. imperialism owes to the Vietnamese people must be repaid!

The heroic Vietnamese people, in their resistance against the U.S. imperialists' large-scale air raids, have shot down a large number of American aggressor planes. The Chinese people warmly applaud the glorious achievements of the Vietnamese people.

The recent escalation of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness, indicating that it is already extremely isolated and at its wits' end in the Vietnam War.

Under the victorious resistance of the Vietnamese people, the U.S. imperialists' second "dry season offensive" has suffered a miserable defeat. Thus, they have had to resort to increasing troops to try to reverse the situation. However, the more troops they increase, the more miserable their defeat. Now, the number of U.S. invading troops has reached over 460,000, but they are still on the defensive, struggling to cope. The U.S. domestic manpower is on the verge of exhaustion, and its Western European allies and even vassal states are unwilling to be manipulated. The rapid increase in war expenses in Vietnam has caused the U.S. government to face a huge fiscal deficit. Recently, the Johnson administration's proposal to increase taxes has sparked strong resistance from the American people. The armed struggle of the American black people against violence has greatly shaken the rule of the Johnson clique. In short, the Johnson government is riddled with contradictions, in extreme chaos, and is in a deep abyss in military, political, and economic terms.

However, as Chairman Mao taught us, U.S. imperialism "will not readily accept their failure, they will still make their last struggle." The Johnson government, in order to get out of its predicament and cope with the 1968 U.S. presidential election, is playing new military and political tricks. Recently, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their bombing of North Vietnam, precisely in an attempt to exert greater pressure on the Vietnamese people and find a new way out.

"Bombing to force peace" is a trick often used by U.S. imperialism. Every time U.S. imperialism expands the war, a new "peace talk" trick follows. On August 7th, Johnson personally approved the bombing of a large number of "new targets" in North Vietnam; on the 11th, American aircraft began continuous bombing of Hanoi, Lao Cai, and other areas; on the 18th, Johnson hurriedly held a press conference, saying that if the Vietnamese side "agrees to a ceasefire," "agrees to negotiations," the U.S. can "stop bombing." It is clear that the recent intensification of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam is an important step in the Johnson government's plot to "bomb to force peace" and "stop bombing to lure peace."

It must be pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is absolutely not free from guilt for the U.S. imperialists' new crime of bombing Hanoi again to force Vietnam into "peace talks." As early as June this year, after the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in selling out the interests of the Arab people was exposed, the Soviet leader Kosygin hurriedly went to the United States to hold secret talks with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson in Glassboro. It is reported that in this black meeting, the U.S. and the Soviet Union reached a tacit agreement on the issue of "peace talks" in Vietnam. After the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionists also sent their lackeys to carry out extensive surrender activities and colluded with Japanese reactionaries to conduct "peace talks" activities. Recently, the Soviet revisionists have also plotted to directly intervene in South Vietnam, attempting to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. All this fully exposes the Soviet revisionists as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

Any trick played by U.S. imperialism in collusion with Soviet modern revisionism is doomed to fail. The heroic Vietnamese people are determined to defeat U.S. imperialism. At present, the Vietnamese people are responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call of July 17 last year, determined to carry the war of resistance against the U.S. to the end and achieve a complete victory. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists expand the war, or no matter what "peace talk" tricks the U.S. and the Soviet Union conspire to plot, they will all be smashed to pieces in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people!

While the U.S. aggressors are conducting a war of adventure in Vietnam, they have the audacity to send aircraft to intrude into our Guangxi airspace to provoke, and our People's Liberation Army Air Force units have annihilated the intruding U.S. planes, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialists' blatant war provocation against the Chinese people further clarifies that the U.S. aggression in Vietnam is not only directed against the Vietnamese people but also against the Chinese people. The Chinese people have seen through the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and have long been prepared, standing in full readiness. If U.S. imperialism dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate it.

The Chinese government and people firmly support the principled stance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its statements of August 12th and 23rd. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are willing to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S., determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. The U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam will absolutely not escape its fate of complete failure!

    我外交部发表声明坚决支持越南外交部的严正立场
    强烈谴责美帝连续大规模疯狂轰炸越南
    中国人民不惜承担最大的民族牺牲全力支援越南人民打败美国强盗
    美苏勾结妄图压越“和谈”，苏修阴谋直接插手越南南方破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争，充分说明苏修领导集团是美帝的头号帮凶，罪责难逃。
    新华社三十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部八月三十日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近对越南民主共和国进行连续大规模的轰炸，并且伙同苏修领导集团玩弄“以炸迫和”的阴谋。声明强调指出：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不惜承担最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，决心同越南人民并肩战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    声明全文如下：中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六七年八月三十日
    最近，美帝国主义对越南民主共和国的轰炸达到了更加疯狂的程度。美国空中强盗连续大规模地轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市，袭击越南北方的交通线、红河堤坝和靠近中越边境的谅山地区，并且派出B—52轰炸机轰炸非军事区以北地区。特别是自八月二十一日以来，美国飞机对河内市区和郊区进行的狂轰滥炸，给越南人民的生命财产造成了严重损失。中国政府和中国人民对此表示无比的愤怒和强烈的谴责！美帝国主义对越南人民欠下的笔笔血债，必须偿还！
    英雄的越南人民在抗击美帝国主义大规模空袭中，击落了大批美国强盗飞机。中国人民热烈欢呼越南人民取得的辉煌战果。
    美帝国主义最近对越南北方轰炸的加剧，并不表明它的强大，而是表明它的虚弱，表明它在侵越战争中已经空前孤立，走投无路。
    在越南人民的胜利抗击下，美帝国主义的第二个“旱季攻势”遭到惨败。于是，不得不用增兵的办法企图挽救败局。但是，增兵愈多，失败愈惨。现在，美国侵略军已经增到四十六万多人，仍然是被动挨打，穷于应付。美国国内兵源已濒于枯竭，它的西欧盟国甚至仆从国家也不愿听从摆布。侵越军费急剧增加，造成了美国政府巨额的财政赤字。最近，约翰逊政府提出增税计划，激起了美国广大人民的强烈反抗。美国黑人蓬勃发展的武装抗暴斗争，大大动摇了约翰逊集团的统治。总之，约翰逊政府矛盾重重，极度混乱，在军事、政治、经济方面都陷入了万丈深渊。
    但是，正如毛主席教导我们的，美帝国主义“决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”。约翰逊政府为了摆脱困境，应付一九六八年美国总统选举，正在玩弄新的军事政治阴谋。最近，美帝国主义加紧对越南北方的轰炸，就是妄图向越南人民施加更大的压力，寻找新的出路。
    “以炸迫和”是美帝国主义的惯用的伎俩，每当美帝国主义扩大一次战争，随之而来的就是一个新的“和谈”阴谋。八月七日，约翰逊亲自批准大批轰炸越南北方的“新目标”；十一日，美国飞机开始连续轰炸河内、谅山等地区；十八日，约翰逊就迫不及待地举行记者招待会，说什么如果越南方面“同意停火”、“同意谈判”，美国就可以“停炸”。很明显，美帝国主义最近加紧轰炸越南北方，就是约翰逊政府策划“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”阴谋的一个重要步骤。
    必须指出，对美帝国主义再次轰炸河内，妄图压越“和谈”的新罪行，苏修领导集团是绝对逃脱不了他们的罪责的。早在今年六月，苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯人民利益的叛徒嘴脸大暴露以后，苏修头目柯西金就赶忙前往美国，同美帝国主义头子约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗进行了密谈。据透露，在这个黑会中，美、苏就越南“和谈”问题，达成了默契。葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，苏修又派出它的娄罗们大肆进行劝降活动，并且同日本反动派勾勾搭搭，进行“和谈”活动。最近，苏修还阴谋直接插手越南南方，企图破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。这一切，充分暴露了苏修是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    美帝国主义伙同苏联现代修正主义玩弄的任何阴谋，是绝对不能得逞的。英雄的越南人民打败美帝国主义的决心是下定了的。当前，越南人民正在响应胡志明主席去年七月十七日的号召书，决心将抗美救国战争进行到底，取得彻底胜利。不论美帝国主义把战争扩大到哪一级，也不论苏美勾结策划什么“和谈”阴谋，都将在英雄的越南人民面前，碰得头破血流！
    美国侵略者在越南进行战争冒险的同时，竟悍然派遣飞机侵入我国广西领空进行挑衅，我人民解放军空军部队全歼入侵美机，给美帝国主义以沉重打击。美帝国主义对中国人民明目张胆的战争挑衅，更加清楚地说明，美国在越南进行的侵略战争不仅是针对越南人民，也是针对中国人民的。中国人民已经看透了美帝国主义的侵略本性，并且早已作好准备，严阵以待，如果美帝国主义胆敢来侵犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭之。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部八月十二日、二十三日声明的严正立场。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不惜承担最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，决心同越南人民并肩战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者。美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争，绝对逃脱不了它的彻底失败的命运！
