The Hong Kong British "Police Department" and "Trade and Industry Department" recently attempted to use so-called "legal" actions to threaten Hong Kong's patriotic newspapers, *Ta Kung Pao* and *Jing Bao*, accusing them of "defamation" against Hong Kong British officials. Hong Kong patriotic news personnel pointed out that this is another serious step by the Hong Kong British authorities to deliberately persecute our patriotic newspapers.

The "Deputy Director of the Trade and Industry Department," McLeish, on August 1, sent a letter through a lawyer, accusing *Ta Kung Pao* of defamation for publishing a reader's letter titled "The Trade and Industry Department's Extortion is Mocked" on June 28. He demanded that *Ta Kung Pao* publish a statement in both Chinese and English to "withdraw the reader's letter and apologize," otherwise, he would take "legal" action.

Two British police officers from the "Police Department" also sent a letter through a lawyer on August 1, accusing *Jing Bao* of "serious defamation" for publishing two photos titled "These Two White Pigs Are the Main Culprits in Attacking the Union, and They Have Received Their Deserved Punishment" on June 26. They demanded that *Jing Bao* publish a "statement of withdrawal and apology," "compensate for damages," and "reserve all rights regarding this incident."

While attempting to use "legal" means to persecute patriotic newspapers, the Hong Kong British authorities have also recently made extremely provocative moves against our patriotic newspaper offices. They unreasonably assaulted *Ta Kung Pao* staff and intercepted *Ta Kung Pao*'s dedicated vehicles. The Hong Kong British also sent a large number of "riot police" to the *Wen Wei Po* office to forcibly tear down the *Wen Wei Po* posters on the left side of the office's gate, intercept *Wen Wei Po*'s reporting vehicles, and conduct humiliating body searches on *Wen Wei Po* reporters. The crazy provocations by the Hong Kong British police and special agents were strongly condemned by the staff of *Ta Kung Pao* and *Wen Wei Po*. The newspaper staff lodged a serious protest with the Hong Kong British authorities.

*Ta Kung Pao* published an editorial on August 8 stating that in recent months, the Hong Kong British have used all means to threaten and provoke our newspapers. We warn the Hong Kong British authorities: now you are using "law" to carry out political persecution and national oppression against us, and we will definitely counterattack. You have your political persecution and national oppression, and we have our just stance and resistance actions. Whether you illegally arrest reporters, make various provocations, or use "legal" means, or even seal the newspaper and arrest people, it will not intimidate us. We will resolutely, together with the Chinese people and compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, continue to expose you, resist you, and fight you. We will not rest until we achieve complete victory!

The editorial published by *Jing Bao* on August 7 stated that the Hong Kong British authorities are attempting to use "legal" means to persecute our newspapers, forcing patriotic newspapers not to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and not to propagate the just struggle against British oppression. We warn the Hong Kong British: whether you use "emergency orders" to close the newspaper office or use any "legal" means to persecute the newspaper's responsible personnel, we will not give up propagating Mao Zedong Thought. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight to defeat the Hong Kong British!

The editorial of *Wen Wei Po* stated that our patriotic newspapers are the newspapers of the Chinese people. We will definitely respond to the call of the motherland, actively propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought with our lives, and resolutely support the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against British oppression. No matter what means the Hong Kong British use to persecute us, we are fearless and unyielding. Hong Kong patriotic news workers are forever unyielding and unbreakable.

    港英阴谋通过“法律”迫害爱国报纸  我爱国同胞不畏强暴给以有力反击
    新华社香港九日电  港英“警务处”和“工商处”最近又企图通过所谓“法律”行动，对香港爱国报纸《大公报》和《晶报》进行威胁，诬蔑爱国报纸“诽谤”港英官员。香港爱国新闻界人士指出，这是港英当局蓄意对我爱国报纸进行新的政治迫害的又一个严重步骤。
    港英“工商处副处长”麦理觉八月一日通过律师写“控告”信，诬蔑《大公报》六月二十八日刊出的一封题为《“工商处”勒索受嘲弄》的读者来信“诽谤”“工商处副处长”麦理觉，并硬要《大公报》在中、英文版发表声明“撤销该读者来信和道歉”，否则，将采取“法律”行动。
    港英“警务处”两名英籍警官也在八月一日委托律师写“控告”信，诬蔑《晶报》六月二十六日刊出的题为《这两只白皮猪是攻击工会的主凶，他们都受到应得的惩罚》的两幅照片是“最严重的诽谤”，要求《晶报》发表“撤销和道歉声明”，“赔偿损失”，并“保留对此一事件的一切权利”。
    港英当局企图利用“法律”手段迫害爱国报纸的同时，最近还对我爱国报社进行了极为猖狂的挑衅，无理殴打《大公报》职工、截查《大公报》的专用汽车。港英还派出大批“防暴队”到《文汇报》社强行撕去在报社大门左侧墙上张贴的《文汇报》，截查《文汇报》的采访汽车，对《文汇报》记者进行侮辱性的搜身。港英警察和特务的疯狂挑衅，受到《大公报》、《文汇报》职工的强烈谴责。报社职工向港英当局提出了严重的抗议。
    《大公报》八日发表社评说，几个月来，港英对我们的报纸进行恫吓和挑衅，真是无所不用其极。我们警告港英当局：现在你们玩弄什么“法律”来向我们进行政治迫害和民族压迫，我们一定还击。你有你的政治迫害和民族压迫，我有我的正义立场与反抗行动。你们非法逮捕记者也好，进行种种挑衅也好，采取什么“法律”手段也好，甚至封报拉人也好，全都吓不倒我们，我们坚决同中国人民和港九同胞一起，继续揭露你们，反抗你们，斗争你们，不获全胜，誓不罢休！《晶报》七日发表的社论说，港英当局企图用“法律”手段来迫害我们的报纸，迫使爱国报纸不宣传毛泽东思想，不宣传反英抗暴的正义斗争。我们正告港英：不管你用“紧急法令”来封闭报社也好，用什么“法律”手段来迫害报社负责人也好，我们决不放弃宣传毛泽东思想，我们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，斗垮港英！《文汇报》的社论说，我们爱国报纸是中国人民的报纸，我们一定响应祖国的号召，积极宣传并誓死保卫毛泽东思想，坚决支持港九同胞反英抗暴斗争。无论港英用什么手段来迫害我们，我们也毫不畏惧，毫不退缩，香港爱国新闻工作者是永远吓不倒、压不垮的。
