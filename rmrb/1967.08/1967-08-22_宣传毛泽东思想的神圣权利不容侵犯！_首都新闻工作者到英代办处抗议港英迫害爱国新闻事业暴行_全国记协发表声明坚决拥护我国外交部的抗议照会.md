The sacred right to promote Mao Zedong Thought must not be violated!
Capital news workers protest at the British consulate against the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in persecuting the patriotic news industry
The All-China Journalists Association issues a statement firmly supporting the protest note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country

	BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) — More than 2,000 revolutionary news workers in the capital, filled with indignation against the heinous British imperialists, marched to the British Consulate in China today to strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities in persecuting the patriotic news industry and patriotic news workers in Hong Kong. The revolutionary news workers in the capital expressed their firm support for the protest note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country to the British government on August 20. They sternly warned the British government that it must immediately comply with the requirements in the note, revoking within 48 hours the order to suspend the publication of three patriotic newspapers in Hong Kong, releasing the arrested news workers, and withdrawing the illegal lawsuits against the patriotic newspapers and printing companies, and restoring the normal operations of the newspapers and printing companies that have been persecuted. Some foreign revolutionary news workers in Beijing also participated in the demonstration.

	The revolutionary news workers in the capital, holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and banners written in Chinese and English, marched to the British Consulate in China. They repeatedly shouted in anger: "Firmly support the anti-British struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon!" "The British imperialists must apologize!" "The British will be defeated! The Chinese people will be victorious!" "Down with American imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!"

	The revolutionary news workers from the All-China Journalists Association, "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," Xinhua News Agency, the Radio Bureau, "Liberation Army Daily," "Guangming Daily," and "Beijing Daily" read out their protest letters to the British diplomatic officials in front of the British Consulate in China. In their protest letters, they unanimously pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities attempted to suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought and extinguish the flames of the anti-British struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon by persecuting the patriotic news industry and news workers in Hong Kong. This is absolutely impossible.

	The various news organizations stated in their protest letters that British imperialism, in collusion with American imperialism, is actively serving as a henchman of the Johnson administration. Despite the condemnation of the great Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, it has intensified its persecution of patriotic news workers and newspapers in Hong Kong, attempting to strangle patriotic public opinion and suppress the voices of truth and justice. This can only further expose the extremely ugly and fascist face of British imperialism to the people of the world.

	The protest letters stated that our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The various forms of oppression inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people." The arrogant persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities against the patriotic compatriots, newspapers, and news workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon will not only fail to save their doomed fate but will instead arouse greater hatred and more intense struggle from the patriotic compatriots and news workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, thereby accelerating the downfall of British imperialism.

	The revolutionary news workers in the capital sternly warned British imperialism: The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will not allow British imperialism to run rampant in Hong Kong. If you insist on your reckless course, you will only bring about your own doom. The revolutionary news workers in the capital, together with the people of the entire nation, vow to be the strong backbone of the patriotic compatriots and news workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, firmly supporting their just struggle until final victory!

	BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) — The All-China Journalists Association today issued a statement strongly condemning the heinous crimes committed by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities in persecuting the patriotic news industry and news workers in Hong Kong, and firmly supporting the protest note issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country on August 20.

	The statement said that after illegally kidnapping and unjustly "sentencing" more than ten journalists from Xinhua News Agency and patriotic news workers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, ignoring the condemnation of the great Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, on August 17, arbitrarily ordered the suspension of "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xin Wubao," and filed illegal lawsuits against "Ta Kung Pao," "Jingbao," and the printing companies that print patriotic newspapers, namely Nanchang Printing Company and Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company.

	On August 19, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched armed police and agents to raid "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," and "Xin Wubao," illegally arresting 34 staff members from the three newspapers. This is a serious provocation by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the Chinese people. All journalists in China express great indignation and strongly protest this.

	The statement pointed out that the patriotic newspapers and news workers in Hong Kong truthfully report the anti-British struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and actively promote the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. This is their sacred duty, and no one has the right to interfere or can interfere. The Hong Kong British fascist authorities think that by using various despicable means to brutally persecute the patriotic newspapers and news workers in Hong Kong, they can block the voice of truth, stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and extinguish the flames of the anti-British struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. This is a futile attempt and will never succeed. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of various countries are just such a bunch of fools." The fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities can only arouse more resolute and intense resistance from the broad patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, accelerating their own downfall.

	The statement expressed that all revolutionary journalists in our country firmly support the anti-British struggle of the patriotic compatriots and news workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and vow to be their strong backbone.

	The statement sternly warned the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities that the various requirements proposed in the protest note issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country on August 20 must be fully complied with on time. Otherwise, all consequences arising from this will be entirely your responsibility.

    宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利不容侵犯！
    首都新闻工作者到英代办处抗议港英迫害爱国新闻事业暴行
    全国记协发表声明坚决拥护我国外交部的抗议照会
    新华社二十一日讯　首都革命新闻工作者两千多人，今天怀着对万恶的英帝国主义的无比愤怒，浩浩荡荡地涌到英国驻中国代办处门前，最强烈抗议港英当局疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者的法西斯暴行。参加抗议示威的首都革命新闻工作者表示，坚决拥护我国外交部八月二十日给英国政府的照会，严正警告英国政府必须立即按照照会中的要求办理，在四十八小时内撤销对香港我三家爱国报纸的停刊令，释放被捕新闻工作者和撤销对爱国报纸和印刷公司的非法诉讼，并恢复受迫害的报纸和印刷公司的正常业务。在北京的一些外国革命新闻工作者也参加了示威游行。
    首都革命新闻工作者，高举伟大领袖毛主席像和用中、英文写的标语，来到英国驻中国代办处门前。他们不断愤怒地高呼：“坚决支持港九爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争！”“港英帝国主义必须低头认罪！”“港英必败！中国人民必胜！”“打倒美帝！打倒英帝！打倒苏修！”
    参加游行的中华全国新闻工作者协会、《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、新华社、广播事业局、《解放军报》、《光明日报》、《北京日报》等单位的新闻工作者在英国驻中国代办处门前向英国外交官员宣读了各新闻单位的抗议信。他们在抗议信中一致指出，港英当局妄图用迫害香港爱国新闻事业和新闻工作者的手段，压制伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭港九爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争的烈火，这是绝对办不到的。
    各新闻单位在抗议信中指出，英帝国主义死心塌地追随美帝国主义，积极充当约翰逊政府反华帮凶，它不顾伟大的中国人民和全世界革命人民的谴责，变本加厉地对香港爱国新闻工作者和爱国报纸进行迫害，妄图扼杀爱国舆论，压制真理和正义的声音，这只能更彻底地在全世界人民面前，暴露出英帝国主义的极端丑恶的法西斯狰狞面目。
    抗议信说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”港英当局对港九爱国同胞、爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者的蛮横迫害，非但不能挽救其灭亡的命运，相反只能激起港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者更大的仇恨，激起他们更广泛更剧烈的斗争，从而加速英帝国主义的灭亡。
    首都革命新闻工作者严正警告英帝国主义：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民决不容许英帝国主义在香港横行霸道，如果你们一意孤行，蛮干到底，只能是自取灭亡。首都革命新闻工作者和全国人民一起，誓作港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者的坚强后盾，坚决支持港九爱国新闻工作者的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利！
    据新华社二十一日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会今天发表声明，最强烈抗议港英法西斯当局疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者的滔天罪行，坚决拥护我国外交部八月二十日的抗议照会。
    声明说，港英法西斯当局在非法绑架和无理“判决”我新华社记者和香港爱国新闻工作者十余人之后，无视伟大的中国人民和世界革命人民的谴责，八月十七日又悍然勒令《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》停刊，并对《大公报》、《晶报》以及承印爱国报纸的南昌印务公司和香港报业印刷公司提出非法诉讼。
    八月十九日，港英当局又出动武装警察和特务，袭击《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》，非法逮捕三家报纸的工作人员三十四人。这是港英法西斯当局对香港爱国同胞和中国人民极其严重的疯狂挑衅。全中国新闻工作者对此表示极大的愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，我香港爱国报纸及爱国新闻工作者如实报道香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，积极宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是他们的神圣职责，是谁也无权干涉、也干涉不了的。港英法西斯当局以为用种种卑鄙手段对香港爱国报纸和新闻工作者进行野蛮迫害，就可以封锁住真理的声音，阻止毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争烈火，那是痴心妄想、是永远也办不到的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”港英当局的法西斯暴行，只能引起广大香港爱国同胞的更坚决和更强烈的反抗，加速他们自己的灭亡。
    声明表示，我们全国革命的新闻工作者坚决支持香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者的反英抗暴斗争，誓作他们的坚强后盾。
    声明严正警告英国政府和香港英国当局，我国外交部八月二十日的抗议照会中提出的各项要求，必须如期一一照办，否则，由此而引起的一切后果，完全由你们承担。
