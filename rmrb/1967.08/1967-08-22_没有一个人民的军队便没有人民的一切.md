For decades, our People's Liberation Army, following the great leader Chairman Mao, has crossed countless rivers and mountains, navigated numerous treacherous rapids, charged across battlefields, fought valiantly, and forged a new China for the people.

Today, the bugle calls of Jinggangshan have resonated across the five continents, and the torches of the Long March have become the radiant red glow over the four seas. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, bravely taking on the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries," and fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, achieving great merits.

The practice of the Chinese revolution and the one-year Cultural Revolution have fully proven the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Without the great People's Liberation Army of China, there would be no socialist motherland, no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution today, and no great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Precisely because the People's Liberation Army of China is a great army loyal to Chairman Mao and to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and is a reliable pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the capitalist-roaders in power within the party and all class enemies are most afraid of the army and most hate the army. Whenever the two classes and two lines clash at critical moments, the class enemies either ruthlessly incite a portion of the masses who do not understand the truth to direct their spears at the army, launching malicious attacks; or they spread rumors and ignite fires, viciously sowing discord between the revolutionary rebels and the army; or they take up the slogan of "loving the army," using it as a cover to spread rumors, confuse the situation, and attack the revolutionary rebels. We must be highly vigilant against this!

Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the enemy viciously attacks the army, the more it proves the greatness of the army, and the more we must support the army; the more the enemy sows discord between the army and the people, the more we must strengthen the unity between the army and the people. The practice of class struggle makes us increasingly deeply aware that supporting the People's Liberation Army and maintaining the army's lofty prestige is to safeguard the fundamental interests of hundreds of millions of people, to safeguard the fundamental interests of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to truly safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Trusting the People's Liberation Army, we must remain steadfast in times of success, and also remain steadfast when encountering setbacks or when some places or individuals in the army make mistakes or have shortcomings. We must believe that they will definitely correct their mistakes and shortcomings and stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries. Out of the greatest trust and most sincere concern for the great People's Liberation Army, for those among them who have made mistakes or have shortcomings, we should adopt an objective attitude and give them sincere and enthusiastic help.

Currently, our province is launching a mass criticism movement against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong. However, we must clearly see that the overthrown capitalist-roaders in power within the party are still alive and kicking, and they will inevitably make a desperate struggle with tenfold ferocity, inevitably directing their spears at the great People's Liberation Army. Therefore, we revolutionary masses of the proletariat must be highly vigilant and resolutely expose all the tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies. We must more enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," and push the movement of learning from the army to new heights.

    没有一个人民的军队便没有人民的一切
    几十年来，我们的人民解放军，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，跨过了万水千山，闯过了无数急流险滩，驰骋疆场，浴血奋战，杀出了一个人民新中国。
    今天，井冈山的军号，已化作五洲震荡的风雷，长征路上的火把，早变成辉耀四海的红霞。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，勇敢地担当起“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，立下了伟大的功劳。
    中国革命的实践和一年来的文化大革命，完全证明了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”没有伟大的中国人民解放军就没有社会主义的祖国，就没有今天的无产阶级文化大革命，就没有无产阶级专政下的大民主。
    正因为中国人民解放军是一个忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大军队，是无产阶级专政的可靠支柱，党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切阶级敌人也就最害怕解放军，最仇恨解放军。每逢两个阶级、两条路线激战的关键时刻，阶级敌人或则穷凶极恶，挑动一部分不明真相的群众，把矛头直接指向解放军，对他们进行恶意的攻击；或则煽阴风，点鬼火，险恶地挑拨革命造反派和解放军的血肉关系；或则接过“热爱解放军”的口号，拉大旗，作虎皮，制造谣言，混淆视听，攻击革命造反派。对此，我们必须高度警惕！
    毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人越是恶毒攻击解放军，就越证明解放军的伟大，我们就越要拥护解放军；敌人越是挑拨军民关系，我们越要加强军民团结。阶级斗争的实践使我们越来越深刻地认识到，拥护人民解放军，维护解放军的崇高威信，就是维护亿万人民的根本利益，就是维护无产阶级文化大革命的根本利益，就是真正的维护无产阶级专政。
    信赖人民解放军，在顺利的时候要坚定不移，在碰到挫折或者解放军中某些地方某个同志出现了一些缺点、错误之时，也要坚定不移，坚信他们一定会改正缺点和错误，站在无产阶级革命派一边。出于对伟大的人民解放军的最大信任、最真挚的爱护，对他们中间某些犯有缺点或错误的干部，应该采取实事求是的态度，满腔热情地诚恳地给予帮助。
    目前，我省正掀起一个向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人的群众性的大批判运动。但是，我们必须清醒地看到，被打倒的党内走资本主义道路当权派人还在，心不死，他们必然以十倍的疯狂作垂死挣扎，他们必然把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军。因此，我们无产阶级革命派一定要高度警惕，坚决戳穿阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。我们要更热烈地响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，把向解放军学习的群众运动推向新的高峰。
