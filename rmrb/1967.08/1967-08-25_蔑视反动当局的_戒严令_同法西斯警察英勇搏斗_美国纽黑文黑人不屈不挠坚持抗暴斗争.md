	Black Americans in New Haven and other places in the United States defied the reactionary authorities' "martial law," disregarding the brutal suppression and mass arrests by fascist police and military, and continued their unyielding struggle against violence.

	The black people of New Haven, Connecticut, have been fighting against violence for four days as of August 22. The reactionary authorities immediately suppressed the rising black people with brutal force, declaring a "state of emergency" and issuing a "martial law." They mobilized a large number of armed police and cavalry, set up cannons, used new types of poison gas, and conducted mass arrests. By August 22, at least 340 black people had been arrested.

	However, this brutal suppression only fueled the deep-seated anger of the oppressed black people in New Haven against the reactionary authorities. They took to the streets, braving the thick smoke of poison gas, and fought bravely with the fascist police. Enraged black people also set fire to some white-owned stores that had long exploited them.

	On August 21, the black people of New Haven issued a statement in response to the reactionary authorities' suppression measures, demanding the lifting of martial law and two other demands. They stated that if their demands were not met, they would fight to the end.

	Meanwhile, black people in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Jackson, Michigan, also staged anti-violence struggles of varying scales. Reports indicated that black snipers in Chicago shot and injured a police officer.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency, the Malayan newspaper "Frontline" recently published a commentary stating that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, more and more American black people are using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence.

	The commentary, titled "Hail the Rapid Development of the American Black People's Anti-Violence Struggle," said that in recent times, the deeply oppressed and exploited American black people in cities like Detroit have launched unprecedented large-scale anti-violence struggles, forming a powerful revolutionary storm that seriously shook the reactionary rule of American monopoly capital.

	The commentary pointed out that the armed anti-violence struggle of American black people is part of the American people's struggle against the monopoly groups and an important part of the global people's struggle against American imperialism. The great development of the American black people's struggle reflects the unprecedented sharpening of class contradictions in the United States. Long subjected to the most brutal oppression and exploitation, living at the bottom of society, American black people harbor a tremendous revolutionary force. Through their own struggle, they gradually saw through the reactionary nature of the American ruling class, no longer believing in the myth of "non-violence," and chose the path of violent revolution, which is the conclusion.

	The commentary said that the people of Malaya and revolutionary people around the world stand with the American black people.

    蔑视反动当局的“戒严令”  同法西斯警察英勇搏斗
    美国纽黑文黑人不屈不挠坚持抗暴斗争
    新华社二十三日讯  华盛顿消息：美国纽黑文等地的黑人，蔑视反动统治当局的“戒严令”，不顾法西斯军警对他们的残酷镇压和大规模逮捕，继续不屈不挠地坚持抗暴斗争。
    康涅狄格州纽黑文市黑人的抗暴斗争，到二十二日已进入了第四天。反动统治当局一开始就对起来斗争的黑人进行了残酷的镇压，宣布了“紧急状态”，发布了“戒严令”，出动了大批武装警察和骑兵，架起了山炮，使用了新式毒瓦斯，并且进行了大规模的逮捕。到二十二日至少有三百四十多名黑人被捕。
    但是，这些残酷的镇压，激起了纽黑文市深受压迫的黑人对反动当局的无比愤怒。他们纷纷走上街头，冒着毒瓦斯的浓烟，与法西斯警察进行英勇的搏斗。愤怒的黑人还放火烧掉了一些平时百般剥削他们的白人商店。
    纽黑文的黑人在二十一日针对反动当局的镇压措施，发出通告，针锋相对地提出要取消戒严令等三项要求，并表示，如果黑人的这些要求不能得到满足，他们就将斗争到底。
    与此同时，在路易斯安那州的巴吞鲁日市和密执安州的杰克逊市等地，也先后发生了规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争。据报道，芝加哥市的黑人狙击手用枪打伤了一名警察。
    据新华社讯　在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近发表评论指出，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，越来越多的美国黑人群众，采用革命的暴力，来反对反革命暴力。
    这篇题为《欢呼美国黑人抗暴斗争迅猛展开》的评论说，最近以来，深受压迫与剥削的美国黑人在底特律等几十个城市，接连掀起了规模空前的抗暴斗争，形成了强大的革命风暴，严重地冲击着美国垄断资本的反动统治。
    评论指出，美国黑人武装抗暴斗争，是美国人民反对垄断集团斗争的一部分，也是全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的一个重要部分。美国黑人斗争的大发展，反映了美国阶级矛盾的空前尖锐化。长期遭受着最残酷压迫和剥削，生活在社会最底层的美国黑人，蕴藏着一股巨大的革命力量。他们从自己的斗争实践中，逐渐看穿了美国统治集团的反动本质，不再相信什么“非暴力主义”的神话了，走暴力革命的路，这就是结论。
    评论说，马来亚人民和全世界革命人民都站在美国黑人一边。
