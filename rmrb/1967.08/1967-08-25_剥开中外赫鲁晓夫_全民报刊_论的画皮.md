Title: Exposing the True Nature of the "Mass Media" Theories of the Chinese and Soviet Khrushchovs

The head of modern revisionism, Khrushchov, in order to adapt to his counterrevolutionary revisionist line of "all-people's party" and "all-people's state," publicly declared that in the Soviet Union, "newspapers have become all-people's newspapers." The Chinese Khrushchov, in order to restore capitalism in China, also vigorously advocates the theory of "all-people's newspapers" in the news industry, singing in harmony with the Soviet Khrushchov.

Look at this:

Khrushchov loudly proclaims that "Soviet newspapers are truly people's newspapers," that they are "true forums for the people," and "true expressions of social opinion." The Chinese Khrushchov proposes that our news agencies should become "worldwide news agencies" and "information hubs" that cater to the needs of various countries.

Khrushchov strenuously denies that newspapers are tools of class struggle, opposing newspapers as tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He says, "Newspapers, radio stations are just 'telling readers, listeners, viewers about events happening in the world,' 'helping people better understand social phenomena in the world.'" The Chinese Khrushchov as early as 1948 said:

"You are serving the readers, serving those who read the newspapers. If the readers say it's good, then your work is done well."

In a word: newspapers are "all-people's," not class-based. This is the core of the counterrevolutionary revisionist newspaper line of the Chinese and Soviet Khrushchovs.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "During periods when class distinctions exist in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle."

Flipping through the history of newspapers in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, can you find a single "all-people's newspaper"? No, not one. Even that "all-people's newspaper" model praised by Khrushchov, the *Pravda*, if you peel off its "all-people's" facade, you can see at a glance its bourgeois, revisionist essence.

On the eve of the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961, *Pravda* launched a so-called "all-people's discussion" that lasted for more than three months, loudly praising Khrushchov. With a bit of analysis, you can discover that "all-people" is just a euphemism for the bourgeois privileged class. Out of 219 articles, 105 authors held "leadership positions" in the bureaucratic privileged class, and the rest of the authors were artists, writers, and the like, spiritual aristocrats. Some letters and manuscripts that insisted on the revolutionary stance and the truth of Marxism-Leninism were supposedly "killed" due to "obvious flaws." Khrushchov publicly denounced in the newspaper those "individual comrades" who believed that "the dictatorship of the proletariat should be maintained until communism is completely victorious" as "nitpicking" the CPSU program. What kind of "all-people's newspaper" is this? It is clearly the fascist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat!

The Chinese Khrushchov's theory of "all-people's newspapers" is also a bunch of deceitful talk. Hasn't he repeatedly, under the pretext that "party newspapers are not places for free debate," refused to publish articles by "little people," suppressing revolutionary and critical voices? Hasn't he, as early as the period of the War of Liberation, openly demanded that newspapers "consider" the needs of the Kuomintang-controlled areas and foreigners? After national liberation, hasn't he gnashed his teeth and cursed newspapers for "only saying good things about workers and bad things about capitalists, making capitalists feel they have no place in our newspapers"? All this shows that his so-called theory of "all-people's newspapers" is essentially to turn proletarian newspapers into tools for the bourgeoisie to exercise dictatorship over the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that after the proletariat seizes power, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie still engage in fierce, life-and-death struggles. The class enemies use every means to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and attempt to restore capitalism. The Soviet Khrushchov and the Chinese Khrushchov set up the "all-people's newspaper" illusion precisely to lull the revolutionary people into complacency, making the revolutionary people lose vigilance, so that they can freely use our newspapers to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

"With the golden monkey brandishing a thousand-catty cudgel, the jade firmament is cleared of a myriad of dust." The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have burned away the layer upon layer of disguises of the Chinese Khrushchov, and his revisionist goods of the "all-people's newspaper" theory have been smashed to smithereens by the revolutionary people. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and overturn the Chinese Khrushchov's revisionist newspaper line, and turn our newspapers and periodicals into powerful tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat, into strongholds for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 剥开中外赫鲁晓夫“全民报刊”论的画皮

    剥开中外赫鲁晓夫“全民报刊”论的画皮
    路磊
    现代修正主义总头目赫鲁晓夫，为适应他大搞“全民党”“全民国家”的反革命修正主义路线的需要，公开宣称，在苏联，“报刊已成为全民报刊”了。中国的赫鲁晓夫为了在中国复辟资本主义，也在新闻界竭力鼓吹“全民报刊”论，同苏联的赫鲁晓夫一唱一和。
    请看：
    赫鲁晓夫大肆宣扬“苏维埃报纸是真正的人民报刊”，是“真正的全民讲坛”，是“社会意见的真正表达者”。中国的赫鲁晓夫则提出我们的通讯社要办成适应各国需要的“世界性通讯社”、“消息总汇”。
    赫鲁晓夫极力否认报纸是阶级斗争的工具，反对报纸作为无产阶级专政的工具。他说，报纸、电台就是“向读者、听众、观众讲述世界所发生的事件”，“帮助人们更好地了解世界上所发生的社会现象。”中国的赫鲁晓夫早在一九四八年就说：
  “你们是为读者服务的，为看报的人服务的。看报的人说好，你们的工作就是作好了。”
    一句话：报纸是“全民的”，而不是阶级的，这就是中外赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义办报路线的核心。
    毛主席教导我们：“在世界上存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸又总是阶级斗争的工具。”
    翻开古今中外的报刊史，找得到一份“全民报刊”吗？没有，没有，一份都没有。就是那个被赫鲁晓夫吹捧为“全民报”活标本的《真理报》，只要剥开它那“全民”的画皮，一眼就能看出它的资产阶级、修正主义的本质。
    一九六一年苏共二十二大开场前夕，《真理报》开展了一次为期三个多月的所谓“全民讨论”，大肆吹捧赫鲁晓夫。稍稍加以分析，就可以发现，“全民”者，不过是资产阶级特权阶层的代名词。二百一十九篇文章的作者，有一百零五人是身兼“领导职务”的官僚特权阶层，其他的作者则是艺术家、作家之类的精神贵族。一些坚持革命立场、坚持马克思列宁主义真理的来信来稿，据说“由于明显的缺点”，一律被扼杀了。赫鲁晓夫在报上大骂那些认为“无产阶级专政应当保存到共产主义取得完全胜利为止”的“个别同志”，是对苏共纲领的“咬文嚼字”。这是什么“全民报刊”？分明是资产阶级对无产阶级的法西斯专政！
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“全民报刊”论，也是一派欺人之谈。他不是一次又一次地借口“党报不是自由辩论的场所”，而不准登“小人物”的文章，压制革命的、批判的声音吗？他不是早在解放战争时期，就公然要报纸“考虑”蒋管区和外国人的需要吗？在全国解放以后，他不是又咬牙切齿地咒骂报纸“只说工人好，说资本家不好，使资本家感到在我们报纸上没有地位”吗？这一切都说明，他的所谓“全民报刊”论，其实质就是要把无产阶级的报刊演变成资产阶级对无产阶级实行专政的工具。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，在无产阶级夺取政权之后，无产阶级与资产阶级之间，还进行着激烈的你死我活的斗争，阶级敌人千方百计地要颠覆无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义。苏联的赫鲁晓夫和中国的赫鲁晓夫所以要大摆“全民报”的迷魂阵，就是要麻痹革命人民，使革命人民丧失警惕，以便他们随心所欲地利用我们的报刊为复辟资本主义大造舆论。
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，烧掉了中国赫鲁晓夫的层层伪装，他那“全民报刊”论的修正主义黑货，也被革命的人民砸了个稀巴烂。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批透批倒中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办报路线，把我们的报纸和刊物，办成无产阶级专政的得力工具，办成宣传毛泽东思想的坚强阵地。
