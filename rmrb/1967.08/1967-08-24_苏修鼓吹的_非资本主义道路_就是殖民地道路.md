After the Ne Win reactionary clique came to power in Burma, they immediately hoisted the banner of "socialism" and began to deceive the people. Ne Win concocted a so-called "nationalization" policy and boasted that Burma was "marching towards the goal of socialism."

The Soviet revisionist clique praised the Ne Win clique for "taking practical actions" to implement "socialism," claiming that Burma had achieved "nationalization." They even proclaimed that "Burma has taken the lead among the young Asian and African countries that have embarked on the non-capitalist development road."

According to the "theory" of the Soviet revisionist clique, any country that implements "nationalization" is on the "road to socialism." Therefore, they shamelessly bestowed the crown of "socialism" upon the fascist butchers like Ne Win, helping these reactionaries deceive the masses and maintain their reactionary rule. This is a thoroughly treacherous act.

There are various forms of nationalization in the world. There is nationalization in socialist countries, and there is nationalization in capitalist countries. The nature of nationalization is determined by which class holds state power. Only nationalization carried out after the proletariat seizes power is of a socialist nature. Nationalization in capitalist countries is of a capitalist nature; it is merely a means for the bourgeoisie to exploit the laboring people.

As early as the 1870s, Engels thoroughly exposed the deceitful trick of calling any nationalization "socialism." He pointed out: "Since Bismarck has been busy with nationalization, a spurious socialism has emerged, ... which directly and simply declares any kind of nationalization, even Bismarck's nationalization, to be socialist." Engels said that if one follows this logic, then "the Royal Overseas Trade Company, the Royal Porcelain Factory, even the Army Clothing Factory, and in the 1830s, a proposal by a clever man to Frederick William III to nationalize brothels, would all be socialist institutions."

Now, the monopolistic capitalist cliques in imperialist countries and the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries have made it fashionable to pass off nationalization as "socialism." In fact, imperialist countries carry out nationalization to accelerate the concentration and accumulation of capital, intensify the exploitation of the laboring people, and swallow up small and medium-sized enterprises, leading to fierce competition and mergers among monopolistic capitalists, and strengthening the international competition and expansion of monopolistic capital. In countries like Burma, the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie, whose wings are not yet fully grown, carry out nationalization to swallow up the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie's small and medium-sized industries and commerce, to exploit the broad laboring masses to the bone, and to facilitate their selling out to American imperialism and Soviet revisionism to fatten themselves. The Ne Win military bureaucratic monopolistic capitalist clique has swollen up through "nationalization."

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique enthusiastically praises Ne Win's nationalization as the "road to socialism," with the real purpose of preventing the Burmese people from overthrowing the state machine of the landlord and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, preventing them from struggling for complete national independence, and fundamentally eliminating the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary tasks. In this way, they can maintain the reactionary rule of the Ne Win clique and, under the pretext of "assisting" Ne Win in implementing the "non-capitalist road," together with American imperialism, push forward neo-colonialism, and control Burma in political, economic, and military aspects, enslaving and plundering the Burmese people. In a word, the so-called "non-capitalist road" advocated by the Soviet revisionist clique is the road of colonialism.

However, the Burmese people will not be deceived by the Soviet revisionist traitors' counter-revolutionary fallacies. Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, they are holding high the banner of people's revolutionary war, using revolutionary violence to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in Burma, and striving for the thorough liberation of the Burmese nation and the Burmese people.

    苏修鼓吹的“非资本主义道路”就是殖民地道路
    本报评论员
    缅甸奈温反动集团上台以后，就打起“社会主义”的招牌，进行招摇撞骗。奈温搞了一套所谓“国有化”，胡吹什么缅甸在“向社会主义目标迈进”。
    苏修集团吹捧奈温集团“用实际行动”实行了“社会主义”，其“根据”也是缅甸搞了“国有化”。它甚至宣扬什么“缅甸在那些走上了非资本主义发展道路的亚非年轻国家中达到了领先地位”。
    按照苏修集团的“理论”，不管什么样的国家，只要实行了“国有化”，就算走上了“社会主义道路”。于是，它竟然把“社会主义”的桂冠戴在奈温之流的法西斯刽子手头上，帮助这些反动派来欺骗群众，以维护它们的反动统治。这是彻头彻尾的叛徒行径。
    世界上有各种各样的国有化。既有社会主义国家的国有化，也有资产阶级国家的国有化。国有化的性质，决定于国家政权掌握在哪个阶级手里。只有无产阶级掌握政权以后实行的国有化，才是社会主义性质的。资产阶级国家的国有化，则是资本主义性质的，它不过是资产阶级压榨劳动人民的一种手段。
    恩格斯早在十九世纪七十年代，就淋漓尽致地揭穿了那种把任何国有化都叫作“社会主义”的卑鄙伎俩。他指出：“自从俾斯麦致力于国有化以来，出现了一种冒牌的社会主义，……直截了当地把任何一种国有化，甚至俾斯麦的国有化，都说成社会主义的。”恩格斯说，如果按照这种逻辑的话，那么，“皇家海外贸易公司、皇家陶磁厂，甚至陆军被服厂，以致在三十年代弗里德里希—威廉三世时期由一个聪明人十分严肃地建议过的……妓院国营，也都是社会主义的设施了。”
    现在，帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团和半殖民地半封建国家的官僚买办资产阶级，把国有化冒充为“社会主义”，已经成为一种流行的现象。其实，帝国主义国家搞国有化，是为了加速资本的集中和积聚，加紧压榨劳动人民和吞并中小企业，加剧垄断资本之间相互兼并，加强垄断资本在国际上的竞争和扩张。而象缅甸这样的半殖民地半封建国家，官僚买办资产阶级羽毛未丰，它们搞国有化，是为了兼并民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的中小工商业，对广大劳动人民进行敲骨吸髓的剥削，同时也便于它们卖身投靠美帝国主义和苏联修正主义，以养肥自己。奈温军人官僚垄断资本集团，就是靠“国有化”而膨胀起来的。
    苏修叛徒集团起劲地把奈温的国有化吹捧为“社会主义道路”，其真正的目的，就是阻止缅甸人民起来摧毁地主和官僚资产阶级的国家机器，阻止他们去争取完全的民族独立，根本取消反帝反封建的革命任务。这样，既可以维护奈温集团的反动统治，又有利于苏修集团打着“援助”奈温实行“非资本主义道路”的幌子，同美帝国主义一道，加紧推行新殖民主义，在政治、经济、军事各方面控制缅甸，奴役和掠夺缅甸人民。一句话，苏修集团鼓吹的所谓“非资本主义道路”，就是殖民地的道路。
    但是，缅甸人民绝不听信苏修叛徒这一套反革命谬论。他们正在缅甸共产党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，高举人民革命战争的大旗，用革命的暴力去推翻帝国主义及其走狗在缅甸的反动统治，为实现缅甸民族和缅甸人民的彻底解放而奋斗。
