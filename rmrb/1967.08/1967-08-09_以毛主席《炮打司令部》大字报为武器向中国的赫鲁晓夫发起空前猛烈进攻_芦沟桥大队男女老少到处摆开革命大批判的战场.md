The revolutionary peasants of Luguqiao Brigade, Luguqiao Commune, Beijing suburbs, are using the great leader Chairman Mao's "Fire at the Headquarters" big character poster as a weapon of thought to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters, igniting a wave of mass revolutionary criticism.

Currently, the sound of revolutionary criticism is booming along the banks of Luguqiao. Whether in meeting halls, courtyards, fields, or under the shade of trees, it is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism and a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Participants in the revolutionary criticism include not only young and middle-aged peasants but also elderly people with white hair, women with many children, and students in the third and fourth grades of primary school. Some write big character posters, some write broadcast scripts, and some go to the streets to propagate, truly forming a scene where men, women, old, and young all join the battle.

For more than a decade, the running dogs of the Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique have come to Luguqiao Brigade to spread poison more than once. In February and March of this year, the revolutionary peasants here exposed the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within their unit. In early April, the revolutionary peasants of Luguqiao Brigade enthusiastically joined the ranks of revolutionary criticism. The soldiers and officers who support the left and support agriculture here helped the revolutionary peasants study Chairman Mao's "Fire at the Headquarters" big character poster and other related works, making everyone realize that to carry out a good revolutionary criticism, one must combine the criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party with the criticism of the capitalist-roaders in power within one's own unit. And to do this, the fundamental thing is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, the brigade established an unbreakable system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. China's Khrushchev openly opposes the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The capitalist-roaders in power within this unit also shouted that "peasants learning is useless, earning work points is what matters." Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "to overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this," the revolutionary peasants recognized that this was the bad guys creating public opinion. Therefore, they concentrated their fire on the bourgeois headquarters. Poor peasant member Yang Dianzhi said sharply, "China's Khrushchev, the Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, and the capitalist-roaders in power within this unit have miscalculated! Our lifeline is not work points, but the great Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely overthrow them!" China's Khrushchev advocates "three autonomies and one contract," and the capitalist-roaders in power within this unit push for contracting production to individuals. The members, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasped the key points, and carried out criticism. Seventy-five-year-old poor peasant Guo Shilin angrily said, "If China's Khrushchev's plot succeeds, the landlords and rich peasants will once again oppress us, and who knows how many heads will fall by the bridge of Luguqiao. We must listen to Chairman Mao and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

    以毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报为武器向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起空前猛烈进攻
    芦沟桥大队男女老少到处摆开革命大批判的战场
    据新华社五日讯　北京郊区芦沟桥公社芦沟桥大队的革命农民，以伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报为思想武器，向资产阶级司令部猛烈开炮，掀起了群众性的革命大批判的热潮。
    目前，芦沟桥畔革命大批判的炮声隆隆。不论是会场上、院子里、田头或者树荫下，既是进行革命大批判的战场，也是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。参加革命大批判的，不仅有青壮年农民，也有白发斑斑的老人，多子女的妇女，小学三、四年级的学生。他们有的写大字报，有的写广播稿，有的到街头宣传，真正形成了男女老少齐上阵的场面。
    十几年来，彭真反革命修正主义集团的爪牙，不止一次地来到芦沟桥大队放毒。今年二、三月间，这里的革命农民对本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行进行了大量的揭发。四月初，芦沟桥大队的革命农民又踊跃地投入革命大批判的行列。在这里支左、支农的部队指战员，又帮助革命农民学习毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和其他有关著作，使大家认识到，要搞好革命的大批判，必须把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和批判本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派结合起来。而要做到这一点，根本的根本就是要用毛泽东思想武装自己。于是，大队建立了雷打不散的活学活用毛主席著作的制度。中国的赫鲁晓夫明目张胆反对活学活用毛主席著作。这个单位的党内走资本主义道路当权派也跟着叫嚷什么“农民学了没有用，还是挣工分要紧。”革命农民根据毛主席关于“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样”的教导，认识到这就是坏家伙们在造舆论，于是就集中火力向资产阶级司令部猛烈开炮。贫农社员杨殿芝一针见血地说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫、彭真反革命修正主义集团和本单位的党内走资本主义道路当权派的如意算盘打错了！我们的命根子不是工分，而是伟大的毛泽东思想。谁要胆敢反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决打倒谁！”中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”，这个单位的党内走资本主义道路当权派就大搞包产到人。社员们带着这个问题学习毛主席的教导，紧紧抓住要害，进行大批判。七十五岁老贫农郭士林愤慨地说：“如果中国的赫鲁晓夫的阴谋实现，地主富农又要骑在我们头上压迫我们，芦沟桥边又不知要有多少人头落地。我们一定要听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
