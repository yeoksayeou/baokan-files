	Our government strongly protests the Soviet revisionists instructing Soviet sailors to insult the great leader Chairman Mao's badge. The Soviet revisionists' frenzied anti-China actions will only backfire. We have decided to expel the Soviet captain and second officer and to forcibly escort the Soviet cargo ship out of the country.

	New China News Agency, August 13th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today sent a note to the Soviet Embassy in China, protesting in the strongest terms the serious provocation by the Soviet revisionist leadership in instructing the crew of the Soviet ship "Sverdlovsk" to insult the badge of the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people. The note was handed to the Soviet Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Burelyin by the responsible official of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon.

	The note said: On August 6th, the second officer Ivanov and a crew member of the Soviet ship "Sverdlovsk" docked at our port of Dalian, actively demanded Mao badges from Chinese border inspection personnel, then insulted them in front of the Chinese border inspection personnel, and threw one of the badges into the sea. This is an intolerable desecration of the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution, a blatant insult to the socialist People's Republic of China and the great 700 million Chinese people, and a very serious anti-China provocation.

	After the incident, all the port workers and revolutionary masses in Dalian were filled with indignation and demanded that our relevant authorities severely punish the culprits and seriously handle this incident. Our relevant departments have twice ordered the Soviet captain to immediately hand over the culprits to our relevant departments for interrogation and trial. However, the Soviet captain Korzhov was arrogant and obstinate, repeatedly resisted, refused to hand over the culprits, and even claimed that he was acting on the orders of the Soviet Embassy in China. This fully proves that this serious political provocation was carried out under the instructions of the Soviet Embassy in China, with the aim of further worsening the relations between China and the Soviet Union and intensifying the anti-China hysteria stirred up by the Soviet revisionist leadership in collusion with American imperialism worldwide. The Chinese government strongly protests to the Soviet government for the serious incident of insulting the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people, which was deliberately created by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The note said: In the era of Mao Zedong Thought today, when the world is in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, it is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist leadership has reached such a frenzied level of attacking and slandering the great leader Chairman Mao of the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership sees the approaching end of their days in the irresistible torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great revolutionary movement of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that has grasped the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. They fear that once the people under their rule in the Soviet Union grasp the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, they will rise up to overthrow them and drive them from power. Therefore, they use the most shameful methods and the most venomous language to curse Chairman Mao. However, "a small insect shaking a tree is impossible." The Soviet revisionists' curses against our great leader are merely the wails of a few dying flies, which, apart from increasing their own sorrow at their impending doom, do not harm the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought in the slightest. On the contrary, it further proves the greatness and correctness of the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao, and will further arouse the boundless love of the broad masses of the Soviet people for Chairman Mao, and will further accelerate the process of Mao Zedong Thought grasping the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world.

	The note pointed out that because the second officer Ivanov and a crew member of the Soviet ship "Sverdlovsk" publicly insulted our great leader Chairman Mao in our port of Dalian, and the captain Korzhov resisted the orders of our relevant departments and refused to hand over the culprits, the relevant authorities of China have decided to expel the Soviet captain Korzhov and second officer Ivanov from the country, not allowing them to come to China again, and to forcibly escort the Soviet ship "Sverdlovsk" out of the country.

	The Chinese government solemnly warns the Soviet government that if you continue to instruct your personnel to create similar incidents on Chinese territory in the future, the relevant authorities of China will severely punish them.

    我政府最强烈抗议苏修指使苏船员侮辱伟大领袖毛主席像章
    苏修疯狂反华只能搬起石头打自己的脚
    我决定驱逐苏联船长和二副并将苏货船武装押送出境
    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天照会苏联驻华大使馆，就苏修领导集团指使苏联“斯维尔斯克”号货船船员肆意侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章的严重挑衅事件，向苏联政府提出了最强烈的抗议。
    这份照会是由我国外交部苏联东欧司负责人在今天下午召见苏联大使馆临时代办卜烈仁的时候向他提出的。
    照会说，八月六日，停泊在我国大连港的苏联“斯维尔斯克”号货船二副依万诺夫和一名船员主动向中国边防检查人员索取中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像章，然后又当着中国边防检查人员的面肆意加以侮辱，并将一枚像章扔入海里。这是对中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的不可容忍的亵渎行为，是对社会主义的中华人民共和国和伟大的七亿中国人民的公然侮辱，是一起极其严重的反华挑衅事件。
    事件发生后，我国大连港的全体港务人员和广大革命群众义愤填膺，纷纷要求我国有关当局严惩肇事者并严肃处理这一事件。我国有关部门两次责令苏联船长立即把肇事者交由我国有关部门传讯、审理。但是，苏联船长柯尔若夫态度蛮横，一再顽抗，拒不交出肇事者，甚至声称他这样做是根据苏联驻华大使馆的命令。这就充分证明了，这一严重政治挑衅事件完全是在苏联驻华大使馆的指使下干出来的，目的是进一步恶化中苏两国关系，加剧苏修领导集团勾结美帝国主义在全世界范围内掀起的反华妖风。对于苏修领导集团蓄意制造的侮辱中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的严重事件，中国政府向苏联政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：在全世界进入毛泽东思想时代的今天，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，苏修领导集团攻击和谩骂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席达到了如此疯狂的程度，这是不足为奇的。苏修领导集团从中国无产阶级文化大革命的不可阻挡的洪流中，从战无不胜的毛泽东思想掌握亿万人民的伟大革命运动中，看到了他们末日的临近。他们害怕在他们统治下的苏联人民一旦掌握了毛泽东思想的武器，就要起来造他们的反，赶他们下台。因此，他们用最可耻的办法和最恶毒的语言来咒骂毛主席。但是，“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。苏修对我们伟大的领袖的咒骂只不过是几只垂死的苍蝇的抽泣而已，除了增加它们对自己末日的悲伤以外，丝毫无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。相反，更加证明了当代的列宁——毛主席的伟大与正确，将进一步激起广大的苏联人民对毛主席的无比热爱，将更加加速毛泽东思想掌握苏联人民和全世界革命人民的进程。
    照会指出，由于苏联“斯维尔斯克”号货船二副依万诺夫和一名船员在我国大连港公然侮辱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，而船长柯尔若夫抗拒我国有关部门的命令，拒不交出肇事者，因此，中国有关当局已决定驱逐苏联船长柯尔若夫和二副依万诺夫出境，不准他们再来中国，并将苏联“斯维尔斯克”号货船武装押送出境。
    中国政府严正警告苏联政府，如果你们今后继续指使你们的人员在中国的领土上制造上述类似事件，中国有关当局将予以严厉惩处。
