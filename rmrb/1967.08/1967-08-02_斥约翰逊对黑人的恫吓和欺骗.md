The head of American imperialism, Johnson, delivered a speech on July 27th, shouting for the intensification of the suppression of the black struggle in the United States. He screamed hysterically that it is necessary to "quickly, decisively, and permanently" stop the armed resistance of blacks. But he could not help but admit that even the "most severe police actions and the most effective federal troops" cannot deal with the fighting blacks. Therefore, he also talked about "peace and reconciliation," demanding that the black masses "obey the law" and "take responsibility" to "share in America's prosperity."

Johnson's speech exposed both the bloodthirsty and vicious nature of the American ruling class and its paper tiger essence of bluster and cowardice.

Johnson attempts to use threats and deception to quell the black struggle. However, the black resistance has developed even more rapidly. This is a powerful response to Johnson.

"According to the law, this is a crime," Johnson brandishes this tattered weapon to threaten the black masses. But what is American law? Engels pointed out long ago that the law of the bourgeoisie is a "whip prepared for the proletariat." American law is no different. For American blacks, this law means they must endure the slavery of monopoly capital and the constant pain of unemployment; it means they must endure being in a completely powerless political position and the persecution of racial discrimination; it means they must endure being arrested, tortured, and even murdered by fascist violence at any time. The broad masses of American blacks and laborers want to rise up and be liberated, they must smash this law and shatter the state machine of the monopoly clique. American blacks break through Johnson's "law" and bravely take up arms to resist violence. This rebellion is right and well done!

Johnson shouts to stop "violent actions" and talks about achieving "peace and reconciliation" nationwide. His tactics are deceitful. The Johnson government relies on the revolutionary violence it controls to maintain its reactionary rule. It kills revolutionary people with this violence every day, both at home and abroad. Recently in Detroit, the Johnson government killed and injured more than a thousand blacks and arrested more than three thousand five hundred blacks. His call to stop "violent actions" means only they can kill black masses at will, but blacks are not allowed to resist. His call for "peace and reconciliation" means blacks should accept the fate of being slaves. This is pure bandit logic!

Johnson, on the one hand, brandishes the butcher's knife ferociously, and on the other hand, uses sweet words to deceive blacks, asking them to "obey the law" and "take responsibility" to "share in America's prosperity." What is America's "prosperity"? America's "prosperity" is built on the brutal exploitation and oppression of the vast majority of American laborers by a small clique of American monopoly capitalists. The monopoly capitalists gain hundreds of billions of dollars in excess profits from this "prosperity," while the broad masses of American laborers, including black masses, "share" in poverty, hunger, and death. The black masses have suffered enough from this "prosperity," and they can no longer endure it. This is the fundamental reason they rise up to resist violence.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not fearing the threats of imperialism." This also applies to the Johnson government.

Johnson's speech on July 27th is a good negative textbook. It makes the fighting blacks more clearly see that their contradictions with the American ruling class are irreconcilable, and their struggle with this gang of bandits is a life-and-death struggle. The broad black masses will further realize from their own struggle practice that they must completely overthrow the evil American imperialist system to achieve thorough liberation.

    斥约翰逊对黑人的恫吓和欺骗
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义的头子约翰逊，在七月二十七日发表了一篇叫嚣加紧镇压美国黑人斗争的讲话。他声嘶力竭地大喊，必须“迅速地、断然地、永远地制止”黑人的武装抗暴斗争。但他不能不承认，“即使最严峻的警察行动和最有效的联邦军队”，也对付不了战斗的黑人。因而，他又大讲什么“和平与和解”，要求黑人群众“守法”、“负责”，来“分享美国的繁荣”。
    约翰逊这篇谈话，既暴露了美国统治集团的杀气腾腾的凶恶面目，又暴露了它的色厉内荏的纸老虎本质。
    约翰逊企图用恫吓和欺骗来平息黑人的斗争。但是，黑人的抗暴斗争更迅猛地发展了。这是对约翰逊的有力回答。
    “根据法律，这是罪行。”约翰逊祭起这个破烂的法宝来威胁黑人群众。可是，美国的法律是什么玩艺儿？恩格斯早就指出过，资产阶级的法律是给无产阶级“准备的鞭子”。美国的法律也是一样。对美国黑人来说，这种法律，就是意味着他们必须忍受垄断资本的奴役和经常失业的痛苦；就是意味着他们必须忍受在政治上处于完全无权的地位和种族歧视的迫害；就是意味着他们必须忍受随时被逮捕、拷打，甚至被残杀的法西斯暴行。广大的美国黑人和劳动人民要翻身，要解放，就必须摧毁这种法律，打碎垄断集团的国家机器。美国的黑人冲破约翰逊的“法律”，勇敢地拿起武器来进行抗暴斗争，这个反造得对，造得好！
    约翰逊叫嚷要停止“暴力行动”，并且说什么要在全国实现“和平与和解”。他的这种手法是骗不了人的。约翰逊政府就是依靠它所掌握的反革命暴力，来维持它的反动统治的。它天天用这种暴力在国内外屠杀革命人民。最近在底特律，约翰逊政府就打死和打伤了一千多名黑人，逮捕了三千五百多名黑人。他所叫嚷的停止“暴力行动”，就是只准他们任意屠杀黑人群众，而不准黑人群众反抗。他所叫嚷的“和平与和解”，就是要黑人群众安于做奴隶的命运。这是彻头彻尾的强盗逻辑！
    约翰逊一面恶狠狠地挥舞着屠刀，一面又用甜言蜜语诱骗黑人，要他们“守法”、“负责”，来“分享美国的繁荣”。什么美国的“繁荣”？美国的“繁荣”是建立在一小撮美国垄断资本家残酷地压榨和剥削美国广大劳动人民的基础之上的。美国垄断资本家从这种“繁荣”里得到的，是成百亿美元的超额利润；而包括黑人群众在内的美国广大劳动人民“分享”到的，却是穷困、饥饿和死亡。黑人群众已经受够了这种“繁荣”的罪，他们再也不能忍受了，这正是他们起来进行抗暴斗争的根本原因。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”对约翰逊政府，也必须是这样。
    约翰逊七月二十七日的讲话，是一篇很好的反面教材。它使战斗中的黑人更加认清了，他们同美国统治集团的矛盾是不可调和的，他们同这一伙强盗的斗争是你死我活的斗争。广大的黑人群众将从自己的斗争实践中，进一步认识到，他们要得到彻底解放，就必须彻底推翻万恶的美国的帝国主义制度。
