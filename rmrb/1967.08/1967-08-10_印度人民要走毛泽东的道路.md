The thunder and lightning of West Bengal, India, are shaking the Indian land, and a ray of dawn for the people's revolutionary victory is emerging from the ancient banks of the Ganges. Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, the red area of armed peasant revolutionary struggle of Naxalbari has been born. Countless "speaking tools" and "untouchables" have broken through the spiritual shackles of revisionism, risen in rebellion, and with the revolutionary spirit of "trampling on the former nobles," they have seized grain from landlords and plantation owners, distributed land, punished local tyrants and evil gentry, resisted the "mopping-up" of reactionary military and police, and dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary Indian government. The reactionary government of the Indian National Congress is trembling with fear, turning pale, and sweating profusely, crying out, "The peasant uprising in Darjeeling will turn into a national disaster!" But we, the young Red Guards of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cheer for the just struggle of the revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary peasants of India. We enthusiastically acclaim: Let the storm of the Indian revolution be more violent!

The Indian revolution, like the Chinese revolution, must use armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution. The Indian revolution can only follow the path of the Chinese revolution, the path of Mao Zedong. This means relying on the peasants, this great ally of the proletariat, to establish one "Jinggangshan"-style rural revolutionary base after another, to build a new type of people's revolutionary army, to go through a long period of armed struggle, to surround the cities from the countryside, and thus to open the way for national liberation.

Lenin pointed out long ago: "Between capitalism and socialism there is a long period of 'childbirth pains,' and violence is always the midwife of the old society." The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, also teaches us: "Every Communist must understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" This is an unshakable truth. The victory of the Chinese revolution followed this path, the victory of the Vietnamese revolution followed this path, and the Indian revolution must also follow this path to achieve victory.

The Danji traitor clique and the Indian Communist Party revisionists represented by Nambudripath, picking up the old revisionist ideas of Bernstein and Kautsky, following in the footsteps of the Soviet revisionists, frantically advocate the fallacy of "peaceful transition." Danji, in a speech at a mass rally in Calcutta on April 24, absurdly said: "In India, a peaceful transition to socialism is possible." The fourth general election of the Indian National Congress "has raised hopes for a transition to socialism through peaceful means." They vigorously advocate the "parliamentary road," the "Kerala road," and peddle large quantities of this opium to numb the revolutionary will of the people, attempting to lead the Indian revolution astray.

Let us see what these things really are!

The so-called "Kerala road," "parliamentary road," is a complete deception of the Indian people. The Danji traitor clique frantically praises the two "non-Congress governments" of Kerala and West Bengal, shouting about overthrowing the Congress government through the Kerala road. This is sheer nonsense. Anyone with a bit of political common sense knows that the bourgeois parliament is merely a decoration and screen for bourgeois rule. The "non-Congress government" still represents the interests of the feudal lords, big landlords, and comprador bourgeoisie. It has not touched and cannot touch a single hair of the economic base and production relations of feudal rule. It is of the same root as the "Congress government," a pair of twins of the landlords and comprador bourgeoisie. It is just more deceptive. Facts are the most convincing. As soon as the armed peasant struggle of Naxalbari in India broke out, the "non-Congress government" immediately showed its true colors. The "non-Congress government" of West Bengal sent out large numbers of armed police to carry out bloody suppression of the revolutionary peasants. This group of Indian revisionists acted as the despicable watchdogs of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie of India.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The Indian people, who are suffering under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, comprador capitalism, and revisionism, will surely advance the revolution under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The spark lit by the peasants of Naxalbari will surely become a raging fire.

"Asking the plague god where he is going, paper boats and candles illuminate the sky." Let the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries all go to hell!

    印度人民要走毛泽东的道路
    上海复旦大学红卫兵新复旦师三团战士　火正熊
    印度西孟加拉邦的风雷，震撼着印度的大地，古老的恒河岸边透出了一线人民革命胜利的曙光。在印度共产党革命派的领导下，纳萨尔巴里这块农民革命武装斗争的红色区域诞生了。无数“会说话的工具”和“不可接近的贱民”，冲破了修正主义的精神枷锁，揭竿起义了。他们以“粪土当年万户侯”的革命气概，从地主和种植园主手里夺粮食、分土地、惩办土豪劣绅、抵抗“进剿”的反动军警，给印度反动政府以沉重打击。印度国大党反动政府吓得发抖、脸色发黄、汗流浃背，惊呼“大吉岭的农民暴动将会变成全国性的灾难”！而我们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国红卫兵小将，却为印共革命派和印度革命农民的正义斗争拍手叫好。我们要热烈欢呼：让印度革命的暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！
    印度革命同中国革命一样，必须用武装的革命反对武装的反革命。印度革命只有走中国革命的道路，走毛泽东的道路，这就是依靠农民这支无产阶级的伟大的同盟军，建立一个又一个“井冈山”式的农村革命根据地，建立起一支新型的人民革命军队，经过长期的武装斗争，以农村包围城市，才能为全国解放开辟道路。
    列宁早就指出：“在资本主义和社会主义之间有一段很长的‘阵痛’时期，暴力永远是替旧社会接生的稳婆”。世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席也教导我们说：“每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”这是颠扑不破的真理。中国革命的胜利走的是这条道路，越南革命的胜利走的是这条道路，印度革命要取得胜利，也只有走这条道路。
    丹吉叛徒集团和以南布迪里巴德为代表的印共修正主义分子，拾起伯恩斯坦、考茨基之流的老修正主义的牙慧，跟在苏修屁股后面打转，拚命鼓吹“和平过渡”的谬论。丹吉在四月二十四日加尔各答群众集会上的一次演说中，胡说什么：“在印度，和平过渡到社会主义是可能的。”第四届国大党大选“引起了通过和平途径向社会主义转变的希望。”他们大力鼓吹“议会道路”、“喀拉拉道路”，大量贩卖这种麻痹人民革命意志的鸦片烟，企图把印度革命引入邪路。
    让我们看看这究竟是一些什么货色吧！
    所谓“喀拉拉道路”、“议会道路”，完全是愚弄印度人民的大骗局。丹吉叛徒集团拚命吹嘘喀拉拉邦和西孟加拉邦这两个“非国大党政府”，叫嚷通过喀拉拉道路“推翻国大党政府”这是一派胡言。稍有政治常识的人都懂得，资产阶级议会只是资产阶级统治的装饰品和屏风。“非国大党政府”仍然是代表封建王公、大地主和官僚买办资产阶级的利益的。它丝毫没有也不可能触动封建统治的经济基础和生产关系的一根毫毛。它与“国大党政府”本是同根生，是地主和官僚买办资产阶级的一对双胞胎。它不过带有更多的欺骗性而已。事实是最有说服力的。当印度纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争一爆发，“非国大党政府”就立即显出了原形。西孟加拉邦“非国大党政府”派出大批武装警察对革命农民实行血腥镇压。这一伙印度修正主义者充当了印度大地主大资产阶级的可恶的警犬。
    林彪同志指出：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚买办资本主义和修正主义几座大山压迫下的灾难深重的印度人民，必将在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，将革命推向前进。纳萨尔巴里农民所点燃的星星之火，一定会燃成熊熊烈火。
    “借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。”让美帝、苏修、印度反动派一起见鬼去吧！
