	More than 30,000 workers, youth, and residents of Bamako gathered in a grand rally on the afternoon of the 27th, despite the rain, to support the recent decision by Malian President Keita to dissolve the National Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union Party and transfer all its powers to the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution.

	On the 22nd, President Keita announced this decision on Malian radio, stating that the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution "has decided to assume all the powers and privileges previously held by the National Political Bureau from today onwards. Its sole objective is to improve Mali's political and economic situation and to quickly create the conditions for the reorganization of the political leadership of the Sudanese Union Party."

	The National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, chaired by President Keita, was established according to the resolution of the National Conference of Malian Cadres held on March 1, 1966, following the coup in Ghana. The conference granted this committee full authority over the Sudanese Union Party and state organs. The Sudanese Union Party is the ruling party of the Republic of Mali and the sole political party in the country. Its former National Political Bureau was responsible for the country's political leadership.

	Keita pointed out in his announcement: "In the face of the current situation where imperialism is attempting to intensify its damage to the dignity and independence of the peoples of Africa and Asia, the primary condition for the effectiveness of a revolutionary leadership is unity. However, 'for several years, the National Political Bureau has been a leadership body lacking internal unity, and thus lacking an uncompromising spirit towards the revolutionary principles of the party.'"

	He further stated: "The National Political Bureau no longer enjoys the trust of various democratic organizations, which believe that this leadership body can no longer lead them to achieve the political and economic goals set by the party in September 1960 (at the time of Mali's independence)."

	Keita called on members of the Sudanese Union Party and the people of Mali to heighten their vigilance, expose hidden enemies within the party, and prevent fraud, corruption, and embezzlement. He emphasized the need to use all means to defend national independence.

	Keita concluded: "The ongoing national reform movement will in no way affect our active and neutral foreign policy." He said, "We will always remain faithful to our policy of friendship with all African countries and to the agreements we have signed with all developed countries that have been willing to provide us with financial and technical assistance."

	He also stated that Mali "is more determined than ever to implement the monetary agreement we have signed with France."

	Keita's decision to dissolve the National Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union Party has received support from national and local mass organizations in Mali. The Malian National Workers' Union, in a resolution, emphasized the need to continuously strengthen the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, old and new, and to continuously strengthen the revolutionary struggle to consolidate Malian national sovereignty. The National Committee of the Youth Organization of the Sudanese Union Party announced a nationwide mobilization of Malian youth to fully support the patriotic actions of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution under the leadership of President Keita. A delegation of military officers from the Malian General Staff also handed a letter to President Keita on the 23rd, expressing their support for this decision.

    支持凯塔总统解散苏丹联盟党全国政治局
    巴马科三万多工人居民举行盛大集会
    马里全国工人联合会决议加强反帝斗争巩固国家主权
    新华社巴马科二十八日电　马里首都巴马科三万多名工人、青年和居民群众二十七日下午冒雨举行盛大集会，支持马里总统凯塔最近宣布的解散马里的苏丹联盟党全国政治局和由保卫革命全国委员会接管政治局一切权力的决定。
    凯塔总统二十二日在马里电台宣布这个决定时说，保卫革命全国委员会“决定从今天起担负起全国政治局以前拥有的一切权力和特权，它的唯一目标是改善马里的政治和经济形势和尽快地为改组苏丹联盟党的政治领导创建条件。”
    由凯塔总统兼任主席的保卫革命全国委员会是加纳政变后根据一九六六年三月一日举行的马里全国干部会议的决议成立的，干部会议授予这个委员会对苏丹联盟党和国家机关具有完全的权力。苏丹联盟党是马里共和国的执政党，也是马里的唯一政党，它原来的全国政治局负责全国的政治领导。
    凯塔在宣布决定时指出：目前在帝国主义试图加紧损害非洲和亚洲各国人民的尊严和独立的局势面前，一个革命领导机构的有效性的主要条件是团结一致。但是，“几年来，全国政治局一直是一个内部缺乏团结一致的领导机构，因此缺乏对党的革命原则的不妥协的精神。”
    他还说：“全国政治局在各个民主组织中不再得到信任，它们都认为，这个领导机构不再能够领导它们实现党在一九六○年九月（马里独立时）所制定的政治和经济目标。”
    凯塔号召苏丹联盟党党员和马里人民提高警惕，揭露党内隐蔽的敌人，制止欺诈、舞弊、挪用公款等行为，必须用一切手段来保卫国家独立。
    凯塔最后宣布：“正在进行的全国革新运动丝毫不会影响我国积极中立的外交政策。”他说：“我们将始终忠于我们同所有非洲国家的友好政策，忠于我们同所有曾经愿意给予我们财政和技术援助的发达国家所签订的协定。”
    他还说，马里“比任何时候都更加坚决地执行我们同法国签订的货币协定”。
    凯塔宣布解散苏丹联盟党全国政治局的决定，受到马里全国和地方群众组织的支持。马里全国工人联合会在一项决议中强调要不断加强反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，要不断加强巩固马里国家主权的革命斗争。马里苏丹联盟党青年组织全国委员会宣布马里全国青年总动员，全力支持凯塔总统领导下的保卫革命全国委员会的爱国行动。马里军队参谋部的一个军官代表团二十三日也向凯塔总统递交了一封信，支持这个决定。
