British imperialism, in order to maintain its decaying and corrupt colonial rule, is becoming increasingly frenzied in its bloody suppression of our compatriots in Hong Kong. Since the armed provocation at Sha Tau Kok on July 8, it has once again incurred new blood debts and committed new heinous crimes against our compatriots in Hong Kong and the Chinese people.

It has massacred our patriotic compatriots. As of now, it has been confirmed that eight people, including He Feng, have been killed.

It has illegally arrested more than a thousand people, including leaders of the Anti-British Struggle Committee, workers, peasants, journalists, actors, teachers, students, shop assistants, vendors, and residents.

It has dispatched large numbers of troops and police, even mobilizing helicopters from aircraft carriers, to attack, search, and destroy more than fifty of our patriotic organizations, schools, department stores, clinics, and residential areas.

It has repeatedly and brazenly provoked our New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch and other national institutions in Hong Kong, and illegally arrested four of our New China News Agency journalists, subjecting them to illegal "interrogation" or "sentencing."

During the attacks, the Hong Kong police openly damaged statues and portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, our great leader, tore down slogans and pictures promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and desecrated our sacred and inviolable national flag.

The Chinese people are filled with indignation and condemn the new bloody crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong. Debts must be repaid, and evading them is not an option. We must demand that the British imperialist bandits make amends for these heinous crimes!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the face of wild beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice. We must learn from Wu Song on Mount Jiuyang."

The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are indeed following Chairman Mao's teachings. In the face of the British fascists' atrocities, they are fearless and are engaging in a head-on struggle with the enemy. The general strike by workers from various industries in Hong Kong is continuing to be victorious. Since July 17, seamen in Hong Kong have joined the ranks of the general strike, and fishermen from Hong Kong and Kowloon have formed a mighty anti-British army. Patriotic compatriots from various sectors are coordinating their efforts on all fronts, waging a tenacious and courageous struggle.

British imperialism's bloody suppression has met with increasingly fierce resistance from the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Hong Kong patriots, using various homemade weapons, have begun to defend themselves against the counter-revolutionary violence of British imperialism. This is a law of class struggle, which is not subject to human will.

Since British imperialism can use the military, police, "riot squads," and various weapons, including armored vehicles and helicopters, to suppress our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, why can't our compatriots in Hong Kong use all necessary means to defend themselves? The heinous British imperialists and their lackeys, who are running amok in Hong Kong, killing and setting fires at will, expect not to be severely punished by our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the Chinese people? Isn't that just a pipe dream?

The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are truly heroic sons and daughters of China, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They fear no sacrifice, charge forward bravely, and have written one heroic epic after another with their blood. Whether facing the attacks of the Hong Kong police and "riot squads," or in the enemy's prisons and courts, they remain unyielding and dignified, giving a resolute response to British imperialism.

The great struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against British imperialism is a powerful noose around the neck of British imperialism. The Chinese workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are tightening this noose. If the enemy does not surrender, it will be hanged!

British imperialism must understand that Hong Kong and Kowloon have always been Chinese territory. We solemnly warn British imperialism: those who play with fire will perish by it. If you continue down this path, it will only lead to your doom. Do not say you were not warned!

    拉紧套在英帝脖子上的绞索
    本报评论员
    英帝国主义为了维持它的衰朽腐败的殖民统治，越来越疯狂地对我香港同胞进行血腥镇压。自从七月八日在沙头角制造了边境武装挑衅之后，它又对我香港同胞和中国人民欠下了新的血债，犯下了新的滔天大罪。
    它残杀了我爱国同胞，现已查明的，就有何枫等八人。
    它非法逮捕了包括反英抗暴斗争委员会负责人、工人、农民、新闻记者、演员、教师、学生、店员、商贩和居民等一千余人。
    它出动大批军警，甚至从航空母舰上调动直升飞机，袭击、搜查和破坏了我爱国工会、学校、百货公司、医疗所和居民区等五十多个单位。
    它一再向我新华社香港分社等驻港国家机构公然进行疯狂挑衅，并且非法逮捕我新华社记者四人，加以非法“审讯”或“判刑”。
    在袭击过程中，港英警察公然损毁中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的塑像和画像，撕毁宣传毛泽东思想的标语和图片，侮辱我们的神圣不可侵犯的国旗。
    中国人民怀着无比的愤慨，声讨英帝国主义在香港犯下的新的血腥罪行。欠债总是要还的，赖账是不行的。我们一定要向港英帝国主义强盗讨还这累累血债！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。我们要学景阳冈上的武松。”
    香港的爱国同胞正是按照毛主席的这个教导做的。他们在港英法西斯的兽行面前，毫无畏惧，同敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。香港各界工人联合大罢工仍然在胜利地坚持。从七月十七日起，香港的海员又加入了大罢工的战斗行列，港九的渔民也组成了浩浩荡荡的抗英大军。各界爱国同胞在各条战线上，紧紧地配合着大罢工，展开了英勇顽强的斗争。
    英帝国主义的血腥镇压，已经遭到香港爱国同胞越来越激烈的反抗。香港爱国同胞用自己多种多样的土制武器，开始对英帝国主义的反革命暴力，实行了自卫反击。这是阶级斗争的规律，是不以人们主观意志为转移的。
    英帝国主义既然可以使用军队、警察、“防暴队”和各种武器以至装甲车和直升飞机来镇压香港爱国同胞，而香港同胞为什么不能够用一切必要的手段进行自卫反击呢？罪大恶极的港英帝国主义分子以及他们的鹰犬，在香港任意杀人放火，而又指望不受到香港爱国同胞和中国人民的严厉惩罚，岂不是白日做梦吗？
    香港爱国同胞不愧为用毛泽东思想哺育起来的英雄的中华儿女。他们不怕牺牲，前赴后继，奋勇冲杀，用鲜血谱写了一曲又一曲威武雄壮的凯歌。无论在港英军警和“防暴队”的袭击面前，无论在敌人的监狱里和法庭上，他们宁死不屈，大义凛然，给予英帝国主义以坚决的回击。香港爱国同胞有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就有了精神原子弹，就能够压倒一切敌人，而不被任何敌人所屈服。
    香港同胞反英抗暴的伟大斗争，是套在英帝国主义脖子上的一条强大的绞索。香港的中国工人和爱国同胞正在拉紧这条绞索。敌人不投降，就叫它上绞刑！
    英帝国主义必须明白，香港和九龙历来就是中国的领土。我们严正警告英帝国主义，玩火者必自焚，你们沿着这条路走下去，只能是死路一条。勿谓言之不预也！
