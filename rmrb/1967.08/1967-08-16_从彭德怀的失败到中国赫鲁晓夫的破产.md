In the midst of the high tide of criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and in the great revolutionary advance to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, the publication of the summary of the "Decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Anti-Party Clique Led by Peng Dehuai" has significant importance.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also known as the Lushan Conference, was convened at a time when the socialist revolution in our country was deepening and the class struggle at home and abroad was unprecedentedly intense. The greatest historical achievement of this conference was that it smashed the usurpation plot of the anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai, defended the Party's general line, and defended the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. As the "Decision" pointed out: "To resolutely smash the activities of the right-opportunist anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai is not only completely necessary for defending the Party's general line, but also completely necessary for defending the leadership of the Party's Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, for defending the unity of the Party, and for defending the socialist cause of the Party and the people."

After our country basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production and achieved great victories in the struggle against the rightists, in 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the general line of building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and excellent work. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line, our people created the new social organization form of the people's communes in the countryside, and the whole country saw a flourishing situation of the Great Leap Forward. Socialist morale was highly upheld, and capitalist evil tendencies were severely struck. The great victories of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement aroused the most intense, most despicable, and most frenzied resistance from the class enemies at home and abroad.

Under such a situation of class struggle, Peng Dehuai, the vanguard of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, took off his shirt and joined the battle. He rallied Huang Kesheng, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Xiaozhou, and a few other anti-party elements at the Lushan Conference to launch a ferocious attack on the Party. He also put forward a so-called "Opinion Book," which was a thorough counter-revolutionary program.

Peng Dehuai and his gang acted as parrots for Dulles, Khrushchev, and the like. They viciously attacked the general line as "'left' adventurism," the Great Leap Forward as "raising false alarms" and "running a high fever," and the people's communes as "established too early" and "mismanaged." They slandered the great mass movement led by Chairman Mao of hundreds of millions of people as "petty-bourgeois enthusiasm." They also shouted that "political leadership and economic measures must be given equal importance." Their so-called "equal importance" was to oppose the prominence of politics, to oppose political leadership, to advocate the prominence of money, and to pursue material incentives. They also viciously attacked our greatest leader Chairman Mao.

In summary, they attempted to overthrow the Party's line for socialist construction, to overthrow the people's communes, to counterattack and settle accounts with the Great Leap Forward, to oppose the socialist road, and to attempt to drag China onto the revisionist track.

The large amount of evidence exposed at the Lushan Conference fully proved that Peng Dehuai and his gang were a well-organized, well-prepared, and well-planned anti-party and anti-military conspiracy group.

The "Decision" pointed out, "The attack from within the Party, especially from within the Central Committee of the Party, is obviously more dangerous than the attack from outside the Party." The Lushan Conference exposed the great conspiracy of Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique to usurp the Party and the military and seized their power. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. After the Lushan Conference, the close comrade-in-arms and best student of Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao, who had always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took charge of the work of the Military Commission, making the military power more firmly in the hands of the proletarian headquarters. This greatly strengthened the proletarian headquarters and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Peng Dehuai has always stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, opposing Chairman Mao and opposing the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the history of our Party's line struggles, he has always stood on the opportunist side, opposing Chairman Mao's correct line.

During the ten-year civil war, he opposed Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary path of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside, and faithfully executed the adventurist and opportunist lines of Li Lisan and Wang Ming.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he stubbornly pushed the capitulationist line of Wang Ming, advocating "everything through the united front," canceling the leadership of the proletariat, and opposing the proletariat's seizure of power. He also extensively propagated the extreme hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie's "liberty, equality, fraternity," advocating "do not impose on others what you do not want for yourself," and shamelessly praising Chiang Kai-shek as the "wise leader of the resistance war." In the War of Resistance Against Japan, where the Chinese people were fighting to the death against national enemies and class enemies, he used this set of ideas to deceive and fool the masses, fully exposing himself as an enemy of the revolutionary people.

After our country entered the stage of socialist revolution, Peng Dehuai's anti-party activities became even more rampant. In 1953, when our country's three major transformations of socialism had just begun, he colluded with the ambitious plotter Gao Gang and the counter-revolutionary element Rao Shushi to form an anti-party alliance. The actual leader of the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance was Peng Dehuai. They colluded with foreign forces, used two-faced tactics, and conspired to usurp the Party and the military. The anti-party activities of Peng Dehuai's clique at the Lushan Conference, as pointed out in the "Decision," were "a continuation and development of the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance incident."

At the Lushan Conference, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle that took place at Lushan is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two great opposing classes of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the past ten years of socialist revolution in China. In China, in our Party, this kind of struggle will have to continue, at least for another twenty years, possibly for half a century, in short, until the class is completely eliminated, the struggle will cease."

Chairman Mao's words profoundly explain the essence of our Party's struggle against Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique. The process of class struggle since the Lushan Conference, from Peng Dehuai's failure to the collapse of the Chinese Khrushchev, fully proves Chairman Mao's brilliant scientific judgment.

The struggle at the Lushan Conference was a major confrontation between two classes, two lines, two roads, and two headquarters.

Peng Dehuai's anti-party activities at the Lushan Conference were actually carried out under the support and protection of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. Peng Dehuai's anti-party "Opinion Book" was the counter-revolutionary program of the bourgeois headquarters to restore capitalism. Peng Dehuai was the vanguard of this bourgeois headquarters. At that time, they thought they had an opportunity, so Peng Dehuai fiercely charged out, and the Chinese Khrushchev personally raised the banner of "anti-leftism" to attack the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. After a struggle, Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique was defeated. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the Chinese Khrushchev quickly covered Peng Dehuai's retreat and used two-faced counter-revolutionary tactics to create chaos and sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

From 1960 to 1962, due to Khrushchev's revisionism betraying our country and causing economic sabotage, and due to natural disasters, our country encountered temporary economic difficulties. Internationally, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries formed a "holy alliance" and launched another wave of anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people. In the eyes of the gentlemen of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, the sky was about to collapse, and the country was about to sink. They saw the opportunity to restore capitalism. Thus, they mobilized all their forces, fanned the flames, and stirred up the ghosts and snakes, inciting the ghosts and snakes to create a counter-revolutionary public opinion.

The hired writers of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries and the guests of the bourgeois headquarters, Wu Han, took the lead in donning armor and shouting loudly to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai. In the poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Wu Han lamented Peng Dehuai's dismissal, saying "my dismissal was unjust," praising him as a "hero standing tall" and a "man of integrity," encouraging him to "not yield, not lose heart," "to try again after failure," and shouting "to resume office one day and restore order," which was to prepare public opinion for Peng Dehuai's counterattack and settle accounts.

The generals of the bourgeois headquarters, Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and the infamous "Three Family Village" gang also joined in, loudly praising "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," advocating the so-called "Hai Rui spirit" throughout the country to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

In the midst of this counter-revolutionary public opinion, the chief of the bourgeois headquarters, the Chinese Khrushchev, personally appeared on the stage. In January 1962, at the enlarged meeting of the Central Work Conference, he publicly rehabilitated Peng Dehuai. He defended Peng Dehuai, saying that Peng Dehuai's anti-party program "was mostly in line with the facts" and "did not constitute an error." He viciously attacked the struggle led by Chairman Mao against Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique as an "erroneous and excessive struggle." With the strong support and encouragement of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, in June 1962, threw out an 80,000-word rehabilitation book. In this book, he once again viciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao, attacked the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and sang in unison with the Chinese Khrushchev.

At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the battle call to never forget class struggle. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, the people of the whole country rose up to fight back and gave a resolute blow to the attack launched by the bourgeois headquarters.

In the second half of 1965, Chairman Mao personally took charge of the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Chairman Mao pointed out: "The key issue of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' is 'dismissal.' The Jiaqing Emperor dismissed Hai Rui's official position, and in 1959, we dismissed Peng Dehuai's official position. Peng Dehuai is also 'Hai Rui.'" Chairman Mao's criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" not only hit the key issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" but also hit the key issue of the entire bourgeois headquarters.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally started from "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements behind the "Three Family Village" Peng Zhen, and exposing the Peng, Luo, Lu, Yang counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. On August 5, 1966, Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," further exposing the long-standing struggle between the two lines and two headquarters within the Party. Under Chairman Mao's call, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses directly attacked the bourgeois headquarters, uprooted the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and carried out a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and its poison in various fronts. The Chinese Khrushchev collapsed. This is the greatest and most glorious victory of our Party.

In April 1949, when the great People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, Chairman Mao wrote a magnificent poem that swallows mountains and rivers, including the following four lines:

The tiger crouches, the dragon coils, today is better than yesterday,
The world is turned upside down, how grand and stirring!
It is appropriate to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage,
It is not appropriate to seek fame and imitate the King of Chu.

In today's high tide of revolutionary criticism, we reread this poem and feel it is even more intimate. We must further carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, further temper the revolutionary edge, unite the broadest masses, thoroughly settle the accounts of Peng Dehuai's anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong crimes, thoroughly settle the accounts of the Chinese Khrushchev's anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong crimes, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and carry out a thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

    从彭德怀的失败到中国赫鲁晓夫的破产
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十三期社论
    在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大批判的高潮中，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的革命大进军中，《中国共产党八届八中全会关于以彭德怀为首的反党集团的决议》（摘要）的公开发表，具有重大意义。
    中国共产党八届八中全会即庐山会议，是在我国社会主义革命深入发展，国内外阶级斗争空前激烈的形势下召开的。这次会议的最伟大的历史功绩，在于它粉碎了以彭德怀为首的反党集团的篡党阴谋，保卫了党的总路线，保卫了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。正如《决议》所指出的：“坚决粉碎以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义反党集团的活动，不但对于保卫党的总路线是完全必要的，而且对于保卫党的以毛泽东同志为首的中央的领导、保卫党的团结、保卫党和人民的社会主义事业，都是完全必要的。”
    在我国基本完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，取得了反右派斗争的伟大胜利之后，一九五八年，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国人民在农村中创造了人民公社这一崭新的社会组织形式，全国出现了蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进局面，社会主义正气高度发扬，资本主义邪气受到沉重的打击。党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的伟大胜利，激起了国内外阶级敌人最激烈、最卑鄙、最疯狂的反抗。
    在这种阶级斗争形势下，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部里面的急先锋彭德怀，赤膊上阵了。他纠集黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等一小撮反党分子，在庐山会议上，向党发起了猖狂进攻。他还抛出了一个所谓的《意见书》，这个《意见书》是彻头彻尾的反革命纲领。
    彭德怀这些家伙，充当了杜勒斯、赫鲁晓夫之流的应声虫。他们恶毒地攻击总路线，是“‘左’倾冒险主义”，大跃进是“升虚火”、“发高烧”，人民公社“办早了”、“搞糟了”。他们把毛主席领导的几亿人民的伟大群众运动，污蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”。他们还叫嚷什么政治挂帅与经济措施“两者必须并重”。他们所谓“两者并重”，就是反对突出政治，反对政治挂帅，主张钞票挂帅，搞物质刺激。他们还恶毒地攻击我们最伟大的领袖毛主席。
    总而言之，他们就是妄图推翻党的社会主义建设总路线，推翻人民公社，对大跃进进行反攻倒算，就是反对走社会主义道路，妄图把中国拉上修正主义的轨道。
    庐山会议所揭露出来的大量事实证明，彭德怀这一伙，完全是一个有目的、有准备、有计划、有组织的篡党篡军的阴谋集团。
    《决议》指出，“来自党内特别是来自党中央内部的进攻，显然比来自党外的进攻更为危险”。庐山会议揭露了彭德怀反党集团篡党篡军的大阴谋，夺了他们的权。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。庐山会议以后，毛主席的亲密战友和最好的学生、一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志主持了军委工作，使军权更加牢固地掌握在无产阶级司令部手中。这就大大地加强了无产阶级司令部，巩固了无产阶级专政。
    彭德怀一贯站在反动的资产阶级立场上，反对毛主席，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。在我党历史上历次路线斗争中，他都是站在机会主义方面，反对毛主席的正确路线。
    在十年内战时期，他反对毛主席的建立农村根据地、以农村包围城市的唯一正确的革命道路，忠实执行李立三、王明的冒险主义、机会主义路线。
    在抗日战争时期，他顽固地推行王明的投降主义路线，主张“一切经过统一战线”，取消无产阶级领导权，反对无产阶级夺取政权。他还大肆宣扬资产阶级极端虚伪的“自由、平等、博爱”，宣扬什么“己所不欲，勿施于人”，并且无耻地吹捧蒋介石是“领导抗战的英明领袖”。在中国人民同民族敌人、阶级敌人进行生死搏斗的抗日战争中，他用这一套来欺骗和愚弄群众，这就充分暴露了他是革命人民的敌人。
    我国进入社会主义革命阶段，彭德怀的反党活动就更加猖狂了。一九五三年，我国社会主义三大改造刚一开始，他就伙同大野心家高岗、反革命分子饶漱石结成反党联盟。高饶联盟的实际领袖是彭德怀。他们里通外国，搞两面手法，阴谋篡党篡军。庐山会议上彭德怀反党集团的反党活动，正如《决议》所指出的，“是高饶反党联盟事件的继续和发展”。
    毛主席在庐山会议上指出：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，至少还要斗二十年，可能要斗半个世纪，总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息。”
    毛主席的这段话，极其深刻地说明了我们党同彭德怀反党集团斗争的实质。庐山会议以来的阶级斗争进程，从彭德怀的失败到中国赫鲁晓夫的破产，完全证明了毛主席这一天才的科学论断。
    庐山会议上的这场斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线、两个司令部斗争的一次大交锋。
    庐山会议上彭德怀的反党活动，实际上是在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的支持和包庇之下进行的。彭德怀的反党《意见书》，也就是资产阶级司令部复辟资本主义的反革命纲领。彭德怀就是这个资产阶级司令部的反党急先锋。当时，他们认为有机可乘，彭德怀就恶狠狠地冲了出来，而中国的赫鲁晓夫也亲自打起“反左”的旗子，来攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社。经过一番较量，彭德怀反党集团被打败了。中国的赫鲁晓夫看到形势不妙，就连忙掩护彭德怀退却，并且采取反革命两面派的手法，制造混乱，阴谋破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    一九六○年到一九六二年，由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义背信弃义，对我国进行经济破坏，由于遭受自然灾害，我国遇到了暂时的经济困难。在国际上，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，结成了“神圣同盟”，又一次掀起了反共、反华、反人民的逆流。在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的那班老爷们看来，天快要塌下来了，神州快要陆沉了，他们复辟资本主义的时机到来了。于是，他们倾巢出动，煽阴风，点鬼火，鼓动牛鬼蛇神，大造反革命舆论。
    美蒋反动派的御用文人，资产阶级司令部的座上客吴晗，首先披挂上阵，大喊大叫，替彭德怀翻案。在《海瑞罢官》这株大毒草中，吴晗为彭德怀被罢官鸣冤叫屈，说“将我罢职理不公”，吹捧他是“昂然挺立的英雄”，“顶天立地的大丈夫”，鼓励他“不屈服，不丧气”，“失败了再干”，叫喊“有一日再居官重整纪纲”，就是要为彭德怀进行反攻倒算作舆论准备。
    资产阶级司令部的大将彭真、陆定一、周扬等人以及臭名远扬的“三家村”狐群狗党，也鼓噪而起，大肆吹捧《海瑞罢官》，在全国鼓吹反党反社会主义的所谓“海瑞精神”，为彭德怀翻案，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    在这场反革命舆论的锣鼓声中，资产阶级司令部的总头目、中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自出场了。一九六二年一月，在扩大的中央工作会议上，他公然替彭德怀翻案。他为彭德怀辩护说，彭德怀的反党纲领“不少还是符合事实的”，“并不算犯错误”。他恶毒地攻击毛主席领导的对彭德怀反党集团的斗争是“错误的过火的斗争”。在中国的赫鲁晓夫的大力支持和鼓励下，彭德怀在一九六二年六月，抛出了一个洋洋八万言的翻案书。在这个翻案书里，他再一次恶毒地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社，同中国的赫鲁晓夫一唱一和。
    一九六二年党的八届十中全会上，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的战斗号召。全国人民在毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的伟大理论的指引下，奋起迎战，对资产阶级司令部挑起的这场进攻予以迎头痛击。
    一九六五年下半年，毛主席亲自抓了对《海瑞罢官》的批判。毛主席指出：《海瑞罢官》的“要害问题是‘罢官’。嘉靖皇帝罢了海瑞的官，一九五九年我们罢了彭德怀的官。彭德怀也是‘海瑞’。”毛主席对《海瑞罢官》的这一批判，不仅打中了《海瑞罢官》的要害，而且打中了整个资产阶级司令部的要害。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，从《海瑞罢官》打开一个缺口，揪出了“三家村”的后台反革命修正主义分子彭真，揪出了彭、罗、陆、杨反革命修正主义集团。一九六六年八月五日，毛主席写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，进一步揭开了党内长期存在的两条路线、两个司令部斗争的盖子。亿万革命群众在毛主席的号召下，直捣资产阶级司令部，挖出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。对这条反革命修正主义路线及其在各个战线上的流毒，进行了革命的大批判。中国的赫鲁晓夫破产了。这是我们党的最伟大、最辉煌的胜利。
    一九四九年四月，伟大的人民解放军过大江的时候，毛主席写了一首气吞山河的壮丽诗篇，其中有四句：
    虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。
    宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。
    在今天革命大批判的高潮中，我们重读这首诗，感到倍加亲切。我们要进一步发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，进一步磨砺革命的锐气，团结最广大群众，彻底清算彭德怀的反党反社会主义反毛主席的罪行，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫的反党反社会主义反毛主席的罪行，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，全面地、深入地开展革命的大批判，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭。
