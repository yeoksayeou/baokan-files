Shatter the Shackles of "Non-Violence" Use Revolutionary Violence to Resist Counter-Revolutionary Violence

Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Path to the Liberation of American Blacks

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 7th, our correspondent's commentary: The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, issued a statement on August 8, 1963, "In Support of the Just Struggle of the American Black People Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination," which, like a thunderclap, shook the land of the United States and powerfully encouraged the American blacks in their struggle for survival and liberation. Over the past four years, the awakening of the broad masses of American blacks has continued to deepen, their fighting will has become more resolute, their spirits more uplifted, and they have broken through the constraints of "non-violence," rising up to use revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence, pushing the black struggle to a new high.

The development of the black struggle in the United States over the past four years has fully proven the series of brilliant propositions put forward by Chairman Mao in the statement, demonstrating the tremendous power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. On August 1, the young American black leader Carmichael emphasized in an interview: "Mao Zedong has brought the idea of struggle to the West.... Many American blacks participating in the struggle are holding his little red book. His teachings, such as 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' and so on, are very clear. These ideas are helping American blacks to awaken more and more."

Since the summer of 1964, when the blacks in New York's Harlem district launched the first large-scale anti-violence struggle, the tide of armed anti-violence struggles among American blacks has surged year by year, affecting more and more regions, with more and more blacks participating consciously and organizedly, and the level of struggle continuously rising, dealing heavier blows to the white ruling class. Currently, armed anti-violence has become the main form of the current black struggle. This is the most important feature of the development of the black struggle in the United States over the past four years.

Since the beginning of summer this year, in just two months, the flames of black armed anti-violence struggles have not only swept through more than ninety large and small cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Detroit, but have also ignited in the heart of U.S. imperialism's rule, Washington.

The blacks in Detroit, the fifth-largest city in the United States, fought bravely for nearly a week against the bloody suppression of nearly twenty thousand armed military police, adding a new chapter of unprecedented heroism to the history of the black struggle in the United States. The surging tide of black armed anti-violence struggles strongly shakes the domestic rule of U.S. imperialism, making the reactionary ruling clique of the United States tremble with fear, crying out that this is the "most serious domestic crisis" the United States has faced in more than a hundred years.

Over the past four years, the ruling class of the United States has repeatedly massacred blacks, which has, on the contrary, educated the broad masses of blacks, making more and more people begin to understand the necessity of seizing the gun. They are no longer satisfied with relying on stones, sticks, and glass bottles for self-defense; more and more blacks have resolutely taken up arms and joined the battle to snipe the fascist military police. In some cities, there have been incidents where black masses have broken into gun shops or armories to seize weapons for self-defense; in the recent struggle in Detroit, blacks used machine guns for the first time to support sniper teams in launching surprise attacks, striking fear into the hearts of the armed military police, who were in a state of panic and disarray.

Harlem in 1964, Watts in 1965, Chicago in 1966 to Newark and Detroit in 1967.... Over the past four years, each large-scale violent struggle has tempered the black masses, making their fighting will more vigorous and their confidence in their own strength greater.

The broad masses of blacks in Newark proudly call their recent large-scale anti-violence struggle the "July Uprising"; they say that after this "July Uprising," they feel more "fearless" and more "powerful."

As the idea of violent struggle penetrates deeper into people's minds, the spiritual shackles of "non-violence" that the reactionary ruling class of the United States has imposed on the black masses for decades to numb their fighting spirit are being smashed to pieces by the broad masses of blacks. If a small group of black "moderates" who have been long nurtured by American monopoly capital could still deceive some black masses a few years ago, today, blacks have exposed the traitorous faces of these people in the struggle. Recently, during the anti-violence struggles in cities like Newark, a few "moderate" blacks helped the reactionary authorities to "put out the fire," attempting to "persuade" the masses to adopt a "tolerant" attitude towards the guns and bayonets of the military police, urging blacks to "maintain peace" and "go home obediently," etc. However, they were denounced as "traitors" by the angry crowd, driven off the stage, some were beaten, and some were shot. The governor of Michigan, Romney, anxiously admitted that currently, black "moderate leaders" receive very little support, and "more and more blacks are listening to and supporting" those "militant revolutionary elements" who "advocate violence and rebellion." He said, "We should not overlook this serious fact."

At the same time, in the baptism of blood and fire in armed anti-violence struggles, a new generation of blacks is rapidly growing. This gives the current black struggle a new fighting appearance different from previous years. They are all teenagers between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, born in slums, and have lived a life of hunger, cold, discrimination, and darkness since childhood; they are full of hatred for the rule of American monopoly capital and its henchmen—the police; they have no "law" and no "heaven," and they completely despise the entire set of "laws" and "order" of the ruling class; they are the least affected by the poison of "non-violence" and the most resolute in accepting the advocacy of violent struggle; in the struggle, they charge to the front, regard death as return, and show the most courage, wisdom, and tenacity. Their battle cry is: "Black Power!" "Stand up to fight, don't kneel to beg for life!"

Currently, in many places, the leadership of the black struggle is actually in their hands. They are the pride and hope of American blacks. Some of their advanced representatives have already begun to realize that under the current system of American imperialism, blacks can never truly achieve liberation, economically or politically, unless the old system is thoroughly destroyed. They have also begun to realize that the black struggle is a part of the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world; starting from this point, while striving for their own liberation, they have also actively participated in the activities against the Johnson administration's aggression in Vietnam; many black youths would rather go to jail than go to war to slaughter their Vietnamese brothers; many black youths clearly realize: U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of American blacks and the Vietnamese people.

The vigorous development of black violent struggles indicates that blacks no longer want to endure their current suffering; they are determined to rebel. The ruling class's original attempt to limit the black movement within the framework of the "civil rights movement" has definitely failed. American bourgeois newspapers anxiously point out that in the eyes of the black masses, the so-called "civil rights law" is just a fraud; the "civil rights movement" is definitely "doomed."

Facing the current raging situation of black violent struggles, the Johnson administration, which has been driven to a state of panic by the Vietnam War, is extremely terrified. On the one hand, it has stripped off all the disguises of "democracy" and "freedom," carrying out more naked and bloody suppression of blacks; on the other hand, it still does not forget to play tricks of deception, attempting to buy off blacks with small favors. However, the awakened black masses are determined to fight to the end for thorough liberation; they are neither to be crushed nor deceived; they will surely fan the flames of armed anti-violence struggles, burning throughout the United States.

With the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the strong support of the revolutionary people of the world, the final victory will surely belong to the American blacks! Chairman Mao had already prophesied four years ago: "With the support of more than ninety percent of the people of the world, the just struggle of the American blacks is bound to be victorious. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which has risen with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the thorough liberation of the black race."

The black masses in the United States have gradually seen through the counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics of the reactionaries through their own struggle practices and have carried out armed anti-violence struggles. In California, blacks took up various guns to demonstrate and carry out anti-violence struggles. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 打碎“非暴力主义”枷锁　用革命暴力反抗反革命暴力  毛泽东思想照亮美国黑人解放的道路

    “美国黑人斗争的迅速发展是美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现”。
    毛泽东
    打碎“非暴力主义”枷锁　用革命暴力反抗反革命暴力
    毛泽东思想照亮美国黑人解放的道路
    据新华社七日讯　本社记者述评：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席一九六三年八月八日发表的《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》，犹如千钧霹雳震撼着美国的大地，有力地鼓舞了美国黑人争生存、求解放的斗争。四年来，美国广大黑人的觉醒程度不断提高，他们的斗争意志更加坚决，情绪更加昂扬，并且已经冲破“非暴力主义”的束缚，奋起用革命暴力反抗反革命暴力，把黑人斗争推进到了一个新的高潮。
    四年来美国黑人斗争的发展进程，完全证实了毛主席在声明中提出的一系列英明论断，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。年轻的美国黑人领袖卡迈克尔在八月一日答记者问时强调：“毛泽东给西方带来了进行斗争的思想。……许多参加斗争的美国黑人手上都拿着他的一本小红书。他的许多教导，例如：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’‘枪杆子里面出政权’等等都是非常明确的。这些思想正在帮助美国黑人日益觉醒起来。”
    自从一九六四年夏天纽约哈莱姆区黑人掀起第一次大规模抗暴斗争以来，美国黑人武装抗暴斗争的浪潮一年比一年更加波澜壮阔，波及的地区一年比一年更加广泛，参加斗争的黑人更加自觉，更有组织，斗争的水平不断提高，给予白人统治集团的打击一次比一次沉重。目前，武装抗暴已经成为当前黑人斗争的主要形式。这是四年来美国黑人斗争发展的最重要的特点。
    今年入夏以来，在短短两个月里，黑人武装抗暴斗争的烈火，不仅烧遍了纽约、芝加哥、费城、洛杉矶、底特律等九十多个大小城市，而且也在美帝国主义的统治中心华盛顿烧起来了。
    美国第五大城市底特律的黑人，浴血奋战，英勇抗击近两万名武装军警的血腥镇压近一周之久，给美国黑人斗争史增添了一页空前壮烈的新篇章。汹涌澎湃的黑人武装抗暴斗争浪潮强烈地震撼着美帝国主义的国内统治，吓得美国反动统治集团惶惶不可终日，惊呼这是一百多年来美国“最严重的国内危机”。
    四年来美国统治集团对黑人的一次又一次血腥屠杀，从反面教育了广大黑人群众，使越来越多的人开始懂得掌握枪杆子的必要性。他们不再满足于依靠石块、棍棒和玻璃瓶进行自卫；越来越多的黑人毅然拿起枪支，投入狙击法西斯军警的战斗。有些城市还发生了黑人群众打开枪支商店或兵器库，夺取枪支武装自己的事例；在不久前底特律的斗争中，黑人第一次使用机枪配合狙击小组进行突袭，打得武装军警心惊胆战，狼狈不堪。
    一九六四年的哈莱姆区，一九六五年的瓦茨区，一九六六年的芝加哥到一九六七年的纽瓦克和底特律……，四年来每一次大规模的暴力斗争，都使黑人群众得到一次新的锻炼，使他们的战斗意志更加旺盛，对自己力量的信心更加增强。
    纽瓦克市广大黑人群众充满自豪地把他们不久前的大规模抗暴斗争称为“七月暴动”；他们说，经过这次“七月暴动”，他们感到更加“无所畏惧”，更加“强有力”了。
    随着暴力斗争的思想日益深入人心，美国反动统治集团多少年来为了麻痹黑人斗志而加给黑人群众的“非暴力主义”精神枷锁，正被广大黑人群众砸得稀巴烂。如果说，马丁·路德·金之流受美国垄断资本长期豢养的一小撮黑人“温和派”在前几年还能蒙骗一部分黑人群众的话，今天，黑人们在斗争中已经戳穿了这些人的叛徒嘴脸。不久前，在纽瓦克等城市黑人进行抗暴斗争时，有少数“温和派”黑人帮助反动当局“灭火”，妄图“说服”群众对军警的枪弹和刺刀采取“容忍”态度，他们劝黑人“维护和平”，乖乖地“回家去”等等。但是他们被愤怒的人群斥为“叛徒”，轰下了台，有的挨了揍，有的受到枪击。美国密执安州州长罗姆尼不安地承认，目前黑人“温和派领导”很少得到支持，“越来越多的黑人正在倾听和支持”那些“宣传暴力和造反”的“好战的革命分子”。他说：“我们不应该忽视这个严重的事实。”
    在这同时，在武装抗暴斗争的血与火的洗礼中，一代新的黑人正在迅速成长。这样就使当前的黑人斗争获得了不同于前几年的新的战斗风貌。他们都是年龄在十五岁到二十五岁之间的青少年，出生在贫民窟，从小就过着忍饥受冻、备受歧视、暗无天日的生活；他们对美国垄断集团种族主义的统治及其鹰犬——警察，充满仇恨；他们无“法”无“天”，根本蔑视统治集团的一整套“法律”和“秩序”；他们受“非暴力主义”的毒害最浅，接受暴力斗争的主张最坚决；在斗争中，他们冲锋在前，视死如归，表现得最勇敢、最机智、最顽强。他们的战斗口号是：“黑人权力！”“要站起来战斗，不要跪着求生！”
    目前许多地方黑人斗争的领导权实际上掌握在他们手里。他们是美国黑人的骄傲和希望。他们之中的一些先进代表，已经开始认识到，在当前美国帝国主义的制度下，黑人无论在经济上或政治上都决不可能真正获得解放，除非彻底摧毁旧制度。他们也开始认识到黑人斗争是全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族解放斗争的一个组成部分；从这点出发，他们在争取自身解放的同时，也积极投入了反对约翰逊政府侵越战争的活动；许多黑人青年宁愿坐牢，也不愿当兵去屠杀越南兄弟；许多黑人青年明确地认识到：美帝国主义是美国黑人和越南人民的共同敌人。
    黑人暴力斗争的蓬勃发展，表明黑人再也不愿忍受目前的苦难，他们决心起来造反。统治集团原先妄图把黑人运动限制在“民权运动”框框里的手法，已经肯定地破产了。美国资产阶级报刊不安地指出，在黑人群众看来，所谓“民权法”不过是骗局；“民权运动”肯定已经“完蛋”。
    面对着当前如火如荼的黑人暴力斗争形势，已经被侵越战争弄得焦头烂额的约翰逊政府十分恐慌。它一方面扯掉了所有“民主、自由”的伪装，对黑人实行更加赤裸裸的血腥镇压；另一方面也仍然不忘耍弄欺骗的一手，妄图用小恩小惠进行收买。但是，已经觉醒了的黑人群众，决心为争取彻底解放而战斗到底，他们是压不倒也骗不了的；他们必将把武装抗暴斗争的烈火越烧越旺，烧遍全美国。
    有伟大的毛泽东思想的指引，有全世界革命人民的大力支援，最后胜利必定是属于美国黑人的！毛主席早在四年前就已经英明地预言：“在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”（附图片）
