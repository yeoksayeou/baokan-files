Today marks the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's issuance of the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. This poster is an incredibly powerful spiritual atomic bomb with immeasurable great significance.

Chairman Mao's big-character poster struck a fatal blow to the headquarters of the bourgeoisie hidden within the organs of proletarian dictatorship, exposing the true face of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Chairman Mao's big-character poster is a great mobilization order to open fire on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to new heights. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, after a year of struggle, the broad revolutionary masses have exposed the ugly true face of China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places to the world; their former arrogance has been swept away, and they are now in the shameful position of being "rats crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them."

China's Khrushchev, in order to realize his dream of restoring capitalism in China, has long been implementing a reactionary bourgeois line and suppressing the revolutionary faction.

In the Jinzhong region of Shanxi and throughout the country, significant achievements have been made in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects. The continuous victories of the socialist cause have made China's Khrushchev and his agents in the former Shanxi Provincial Committee and Jinzhong Regional Committee extremely fearful. This handful of bad elements used a magnifying glass to search for flaws in the socialist cause, falsely claiming that "the People's Communes were established too early" and that "the Great Leap Forward was an adventurist move." Especially taking advantage of the opportunity when foreign reactionaries launched an anti-China chorus and domestic natural disasters occurred over three years, they engaged in extensive activities to restore capitalism. These evil activities were firmly opposed and resisted by revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jinzhong who adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and persisted in the socialist path.

China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi, in order to ensure that their activities to restore capitalism could proceed smoothly in Jinzhong, ruthlessly fought and mercilessly struck down revolutionary cadres who first stood up to oppose them. In the autumn of 1964, they labeled several hundred revolutionary cadres as an "anti-Party clique." These revolutionary cadres, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, waged an unyielding struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the former Shanxi Provincial Committee and Jinzhong Regional Committee.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is underway. These elements feared that the revolutionary cadres they had persecuted and struck down would rise up against them, so they continued to incite some uninformed masses to direct their attacks at these comrades who adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The unprecedented Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places. Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster has sentenced this handful of bad elements to death. This spring, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses of Jinzhong overthrew the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the former Jinzhong Regional Committee, seized their power, and removed their official positions; they launched a widespread exposure, criticism, and struggle against them and their backers within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, as well as against China's Khrushchev.

At this moment, as we commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," which has great historical significance, we must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating fallen enemies, and further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. We must criticize, expose, overthrow, and thoroughly denounce China's Khrushchev and his handful of agents in Shanxi and Jinzhong!

    伟大的动员令
    任井夫
    今天是伟大领袖毛主席写出《炮打司令部》大字报一周年。这张大字报是威力无比的精神原子弹，有不可估量的伟大意义。
    毛主席的大字报，致命地击中了隐蔽在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部，揭去了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的画皮。毛主席的大字报，是向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火的伟大的动员令，把无产阶级文化大革命推向了新的高潮。在毛主席革命路线的光辉照耀下，经过一年来的斗争，广大革命群众已经把中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人的丑恶原形暴露在光天化日之下；他们昔日的威风，扫地以尽，处于“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的可耻境地。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，为了实现在中国复辟资本主义的美梦，推行资产阶级反动路线、镇压革命派是由来已久的。
    山西晋中地区和全国各地一样，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了很大的成绩。特别是一九五八年以来，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。对于社会主义事业的节节胜利，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在原山西省委、晋中地委的代理人害怕得要命。他们这一小撮坏家伙，用放大镜来寻找社会主义事业的缺点，胡说什么“人民公社办早了”、“大跃进是冒进了”。特别是趁国外反动派掀起反华大合唱、国内遭受三年自然灾害的时机，大搞复辟资本主义的活动。他们这种倒行逆施的罪恶活动，当时就受到晋中地区执行毛主席革命路线、坚持社会主义道路的革命干部和广大贫下中农的坚决反对和抵制。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，为了使他们复辟资本主义活动在晋中地区畅行无阻，对首先起来反对他们的革命干部，残酷斗争，无情打击。一九六四年秋，他们把几百名革命干部打成“反党集团”。这些革命干部，在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，同中国赫鲁晓夫在原山西省委、晋中地委的代理人，作了坚持不懈的斗争。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命开展起来了。这些家伙害怕被他们摧残打击的革命干部起来造他们的反，又继续挑动一些不明真相的群众，把矛头指向这些坚持毛主席革命路线的同志。
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”史无前例的文化大革命，敲响了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人的丧钟。毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报，宣判了这一小撮坏家伙的死刑。今年春天，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，晋中地区的无产阶级革命派造了原晋中地委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权，罢了他们的官；对他们和他们在原山西省委内的后台以及中国的赫鲁晓夫，展开了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。
    在纪念毛主席的具有伟大历史意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报发表一周年的时刻，我们一定要百倍提高警惕，发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，进一步掀起革命大批判新高潮，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西、晋中的一小撮代理人批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
