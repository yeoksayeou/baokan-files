The PLA and the revolutionary masses of Beijing and Shanghai held grand rallies to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the PLA.

	New China News Agency, August 1st: Last night and tonight, more than 50,000 PLA soldiers and revolutionary masses from Beijing held grand evening parties at Zhongshan Park and the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the PLA. They joyously hailed the new great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the entry of the world into the era of Mao Zedong Thought. They sang praises of the glorious achievements of the PLA, which was founded by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, over the past 40 years, and its new contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

	Leaders from the central government, the PLA General Staff, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, various military branches, the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee attended the evening party. Also present were representatives from various units who were active in studying Chairman Mao's works, model units, model soldiers, heroes, and those who made contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work. Representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards from colleges and universities, and revolutionary masses from various sectors, as well as Red Guards and labor models from industry and agriculture, and revolutionary masses from government agencies, were also present. They sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helm" together, wishing our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! They also watched revolutionary model operas and revolutionary dances performed by revolutionary artists from Beijing and the military.

	New China News Agency, Shanghai, August 1st: More than 10,000 PLA soldiers and revolutionary masses from Shanghai held a grand rally on July 31st to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the great PLA.

	The revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers in Shanghai have fought side by side in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, forged a deep bond of friendship, and united against the enemy. At the rally, soldiers and revolutionary masses held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing. Every communist must understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'."

	The rally was presided over by Ma Tianhui, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Wang Shaoyong, another member of the committee, praised the achievements of the PLA in the "three supports, two militaries" work. He said that because the PLA in Shanghai has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and brought the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the fine traditions of the "four firsts" and the "three-eights" style, and high revolutionary spirit and organizational discipline to the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, it has greatly enhanced the revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary masses.

	Representatives from the PLA in Shanghai spoke at the rally, unanimously pointing out that the PLA is the unique revolutionary army founded by the great leader Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. The PLA comes from the people, fights for the people, and loves the people. This is the glorious tradition and inherent character of the people's army. They said that the greatest love for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to firmly support the revolutionary leftists. They expressed their determination to stand firmly and unshakably on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the side of the revolutionary leftists, to be a strong backing for the revolutionary leftists, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Representatives from the revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai expressed their determination to raise high the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, to always stand together with the PLA, fight together, and win together. In the face of the iron wall of military-civilian unity, imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, as well as the ghosts and monsters, will all be defeated and fail miserably.

	All participants at the rally expressed their determination to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with all soldiers and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, to carry out the revolutionary mass criticism movement more deeply, to thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the military, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, to make them stink for a thousand years and never be able to rise again. The rally was filled with a warm atmosphere of military-loving people, people-loving military, military-civilian unity, and joint struggle against the enemy.
