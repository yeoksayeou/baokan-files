Chairman Mao has taught us: "The question of for whom art serves is a fundamental question, a question of principle." The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, however, goes against this. He directs and supports his trusted henchman, Zhou Yang, and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, who have obstinately pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts for over a decade, seizing control of our arts. The central slogan of this black line is the "theory of art for the masses." They use the hypocritical slogan of "all people are the service objects of art" and "art should be accepted by all kinds of people" to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism. Their evil goal is to make art serve the restoration of capitalism.

For a long time, under the control of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture, the China Acrobatics Troupe has been a black stronghold for Zhou Yang and his promotion of "art for the masses." The capitalist-roader in charge within the China Acrobatics Troupe fully understands his master's black directives and actively implements them, bringing forth the thoroughly rotten and reactionary theory of "elegance and popularity." What is "elegance and popularity"? According to their explanation: "The audience for acrobatics is very broad, not restricted by educational level or personal conditions, not restricted by language or region, not distinguishing between men, women, old, and young, even monks and nuns love to watch acrobatic performances." The theory of "elegance and popularity" and Zhou Yang's promotion of "art for the masses" are purely of the same ilk. One says, "Art should be accepted by all kinds of people," and the other shouts, "It doesn't matter if they are landlords or poor peasants, workers or the bourgeoisie, as long as they are people, they all love to watch, and they can all sit on the same bench, having common interests, with no class distinctions or differences."

Is this really the case?

Look at the program list of the China Acrobatics Troupe. Most of the programs seem to be purely technical, with no characters or ideological content. However, if you look beyond the performance and examine the programs' themes and the images of the performers on stage, you will find that behind the so-called "no characters" and "no ideological content" there is a lot to be said. What exactly occupies the acrobatic stage? Here you have the feudal magic show "Abundant Joy"; the bourgeois pursuit of stimulation in "Cannon Shooting Beauty"; the decadent and boring bourgeois lifestyle in "Humorous Play"; the heavily Westernized and semi-nude "Contortion" and "Scholar"; and the chaotic and deceitful "Chair Snatching," etc. It's a complete collection of feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist goods, with nothing to promote Mao Zedong Thought. In these programs, the performers, from their costumes to the emotions they express, are entirely the images of landlords and the bourgeoisie: there are feudal princes in purple robes, bourgeois ladies in silk and lace, and fashionable beauties in bras and thongs, but you won't find a single heroic image of a worker, peasant, or soldier. Looking at the stage design and musical accompaniment, the props are either grand and luxurious or strange and bizarre; the accompaniment is either noisy and irritating or soft and decadent. Zhou Yang and his gang use the excuse of "no characters" and "no ideological content" to secretly let feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist elements occupy the stage.

Are these things, which Zhou Yang and his gang praise as "artistic flowers," really "elegance and popularity" and "accepted by all kinds of people"?

The workers, peasants, and soldiers are extremely disgusted with and have long resisted these feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist tricks. The acrobatics troupe often receives letters from worker and peasant audiences sharply criticizing programs like "Ancient Magic," "Golden Toad Sheds Its Shell," and "Humorous Play." A worker in Wuxi pointed out after watching "Humorous Play" that it is a poisonous weed that corrupts people's minds. He said: This program promotes the decadent and wasteful lifestyle of a bourgeois playboy, expressing his bored and declining mood. Such things are absolutely not allowed on the socialist stage. The performers of the acrobatics troupe also demand not to perform such programs, but the capitalist-roader in charge within the China Acrobatics Troupe glares and says viciously: "Just because the audience says it's a poisonous weed doesn't mean it is. We still have our own opinions, and we must stand firm." They ignore the sharp criticism of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and, under the protection of China's Khrushchev and Zhou Yang and his gang, obstinately retain this revisionist stuff.

The landlords and the bourgeoisie, on the other hand, are delighted and highly appreciative of these feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist tricks. According to reports, a Western bourgeois reporter said: "All stages in Beijing are used by the Communist Party to propagate politics, except for the Dongdan Circus, which is the most relaxing and pleasing place." The capitalist-roader in charge within the China Acrobatics Troupe does not consider the praise of the class enemy to be shameful but rather takes it as an honor, shamelessly saying: "The China Acrobatics Troupe should have a Chinese style (actually feudal dregs). It doesn't matter if no one watches it in China, but when performing abroad, it is welcomed everywhere..." To cater to the tastes of domestic and foreign bourgeois masters, to provide them with entertainment and admiration, the capitalist-roader in charge within the China Acrobatics Troupe changes all the programs into silent performances, fully achieving their goal of completely opposing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. To avoid offending the foreign masters, during overseas performances, they even dare not use the red flag, changing the few slogans to goldfish and lotus flowers. Isn't this sheer capitulationism?

From the above facts, it can be seen that the "art for the masses" promoted by Zhou Yang and his gang is false, serving a small handful of landlord and bourgeois elements is true. What "elegance and popularity" is complete nonsense! Since humans divided into classes, there has never been a unified love. Different class positions determine their different interests and tastes. The "elegant" things that the landlord and bourgeois "connoisseurs" appreciate, the workers, peasants, and soldiers will never like; conversely, the things that the workers, peasants, and soldiers love, will never suit the tastes of the landlord and bourgeois masters and mistresses. The "art for the masses" and "elegance and popularity" that Zhou Yang and his gang shout about are nothing but broken goods picked up from the bourgeoisie! Chairman Mao pointed out as early as twenty-five years ago: "Although they advocate in words that art is above class, they actually advocate bourgeois art and oppose proletarian art in practice." Zhou Yang and his gang, under the banner of "art for the masses," peddle the black goods of the landlord and bourgeoisie, aiming only to promote the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We must not fall for their tricks.

The "art for the masses" promoted by Zhou Yang and his gang is peddled by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. It is this China's Khrushchev who threw out the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," providing a theoretical basis for "art for the masses." Whenever he goes abroad, he always takes an acrobatics troupe with him, saying "acrobatics is loved by everyone," but in reality, it is to curry favor with the kings, nobles, and bourgeois masters and mistresses of foreign countries, serving his "three surrenders and one annihilation" diplomatic line. Is this tolerable? In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, Zhou Yang and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, along with their backer, China's Khrushchev, have been exposed, which is a great relief. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, beat the fallen dogs, and thoroughly bury the revisionist "theory of art for the masses," eliminate its poison, make acrobatic art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve proletarian politics! Let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy the acrobatic stage!

### “雅俗共赏”论与“全民文艺”论是一路货

    “雅俗共赏”论与“全民文艺”论是一路货
    中直戏剧口文艺批判组　中国杂技团革命联合委员会
    毛主席教导我们说：文艺“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却反其道而行之。他指使和支持他的得力干将周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，十几年来顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，在文艺界专了我们的政。这条黑线的中心口号就是“全民文艺”论。他们以“全国人民都是服务对象”、“文艺要为各种人所接受”的虚伪的口号，来反对毛主席文艺为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务的革命路线，以达到使文艺为复辟资本主义服务的罪恶目的。
    长期以来，在旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部控制下的中国杂技团，就是周扬等推行“全民文艺”的一个黑据点。中国杂技团党内走资本主义道路的当权派，对其主子的黑纲领心领神会，积极贯彻，搬出了腐朽反动透顶的“雅俗共赏”谬论。什么是“雅俗共赏”呢？按他们的说法：“杂技观众面很广，不受文化程度及个人条件的限制，不受语言、地区的限制，不分男女老少，和尚、尼姑都爱看杂技表演。”“雅俗共赏”论与周扬宣扬的“全民文艺”论，纯粹是一路货色。一个说：“文艺要为各种人所接受”，一个就喊：“不分男女老少，和尚、尼姑都爱看”。言下之意，不管他是地主，还是贫下中农，不管他是工人还是资产阶级，反正是人就爱看，都可以坐在一条板凳上，有共同的爱好，什么阶级性、阶级差别都没有了。
    事实果真是如此吗？
    打开中国杂技团的节目单看一看，绝大多数节目似乎是纯技术性的，既没有表现人物，又没有思想内容。但是，只要透过演出现象来看看这些节目宣扬的情调，舞台上演员的形象，就可以发现在所谓没有“人物”和“思想内容”的纱幕后面却大有文章。占领杂技舞台的究竟是些什么东西呢？这里有宣扬封建主义的戏法《吉庆有余》；追求资产阶级刺激的《炮打美人》；宣扬颓废无聊的资产阶级生活方式的《幽默的玩耍》；洋味十足、半裸体的《柔术》、《举人》以及表现无理取闹、尔虞我诈的《抢椅子》等等。真是封、资、修的货色样样俱全，唯独没有宣传毛泽东思想的节目。在这些节目里，演员们从服饰到所表现的情趣，完全是地主资产阶级的形象：有穿着紫袍的封建王爷，有穿绸披纱的资产阶级小姐，还有只穿奶罩、三角裤的时髦美女等等，唯独找不到一个工农兵的英雄形象。从舞台美术、音乐伴奏来看，道具不是雍容华贵，就是奇形怪状；伴奏不是喧嚣刺耳的噪音，就是软绵绵的靡靡之音。周扬一伙在杂技阵地上，就是这样打着所谓没有“人物”和“思想内容”的幌子，隐蔽地让封、资、修的那套东西占领舞台。
    这些被周扬一伙吹捧为“艺术花朵”的东西，果真是什么“雅俗共赏”，“为各种人所接受”的吗？
    对于这些封、资、修的玩艺儿，工农兵群众是极其厌恶，一直抵制的。杂技团经常收到工农兵观众的来信，尖锐地批评《古彩戏法》、《金蟾脱壳》、《幽默的玩耍》等节目。无锡有位工人同志看了《幽默的玩耍》之后，一针见血地指出它是一株毒害人们心灵的毒草。他说：这个节目宣扬的是一个资产阶级阔少爷挥霍浪费的腐朽生活，表现的是他无聊没落的情调，这样的东西决不允许出现在社会主义的舞台上。杂技团的演员也要求不再演这类节目，可是中国杂技团党内走资本主义道路当权派却瞪着眼睛，恶狠狠地说：“观众说是毒草不一定就是毒草。我们还得有自己的看法，要顶得住。”他们就是这样无视工农兵群众的尖锐批判，在中国的赫鲁晓夫以及周扬一伙的保护下，顽固地保留这套修正主义的货色的。
    对于这些封、资、修的玩艺儿，地主资产阶级是津津乐道、十分欣赏的。据报道，一个西方资产阶级记者说：“北京所有的舞台都被共产党用来宣传政治，唯有东单马戏场是最能使人得到休息，使人愉快的地方。”对于阶级敌人的捧场，中国杂技团党内走资本主义道路的当权派不以为耻，反以为荣，厚颜无耻地说：“中国杂技团得有中国的风格（实际为封建的糟粕）。别看在中国没有人看，可是出国演出，到处受人欢迎……”为了投合国内外资产阶级老爷的口味，供他们玩赏摩挲，中国杂技团党内走资本主义道路的当权派把所有的节目都改成哑剧形式，以达到他们彻底反对宣传毛泽东思想的目的。为了怕刺激外国老爷，在出国演出中甚至连红旗都不敢用，把仅有的标语旗也改为金鱼荷花。这不是彻头彻尾的投降主义又是什么？
    从以上的一些事实可以看出，周扬一伙所宣扬的“全民文艺”，为所谓“最广大的人民群众服务”是假，为一小撮地主资产阶级分子效劳是真。什么“雅俗共赏”，这完全是无稽之谈！自从人类分化成为阶级以后，从来没有过统一的爱。不同的阶级地位，决定了他们不同的爱好，不同的趣味。那些地主资产阶级的“风雅之士”所欣赏的“高雅”的东西，工农兵群众决不会喜欢；反之，工农兵群众所热爱的东西，决不会合地主资产阶级老爷太太的口味。周扬一伙所叫嚷的“全民文艺”呀，“雅俗共赏”呀，不过是从资产阶级那里拣来的破烂货！毛主席早在二十五年前就指出：“他们虽然在口头上提出什么文艺是超阶级的，但是他们在实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺，反对无产阶级的文艺的。”周扬一伙打着“全民文艺”的旗号，贩卖地主资产阶级的黑货，无非是为了推行中国的赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，为复辟资本主义制造舆论。我们决不能上他们的当。
    周扬一伙所推行的“全民文艺”，是从党内头号走资本主义道路当权派那里贩卖来的。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，抛出了“阶级斗争熄灭”论，为“全民文艺”提供了理论基础。每当他出国访问的时候，他总要带个杂技团随行，说的是“杂技人人爱看”，实际是为了博取外国的王公贵族、资产阶级老爷太太的欢心，为他所推行的“三降一灭”的外交路线服务。是可忍，孰不可忍？在这次毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫被揪出来了，这是大快人心的好事。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，痛打落水狗，彻底埋葬修正主义的“全民文艺”论，肃清它的流毒，使杂技艺术为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务！让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远占领杂技舞台！
