	Firmly responding to Chairman Mao's great call, they vow to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production."
	The Wuhan revolutionary faction bravely shoulders the dual burdens of revolution and production.
	They pay attention to doing political and ideological work among the deceived masses. Most of those who were deceived and left their posts have returned to their workplaces and, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, have launched a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

	Editor's Note: The proletarian revolutionary faction in the Wuhan area, which has emerged from arduous struggles, stands in the posture of the masters of the state, bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production. They are determined to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

	While the proletarian revolutionary faction is engaged in a great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in various regions, they must also strive to maintain the new order of the proletariat, firmly hold their production posts, and ensure normal production. They must do thorough and detailed political and ideological work among the deceived masses, using the Party's policies and their own model actions to educate, win over, and unite them, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The more masses we win over, the more revolutionary strength we have, and the more production strength we have.

	We are glad to see that navigation on the Yangtze River in Wuhan is smooth and uninterrupted, and the city's transportation lines are operating normally. Some of the deceived masses who left their production posts have, through the active and serious work of the proletarian revolutionary faction, mostly returned to their workplaces and, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, have launched a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 14th: The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers in the Wuhan area have firmly responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." They bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production and are determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	In recent days, many factories and enterprises in the Wuhan area have held "grasp revolution, promote production" rallying meetings under the scorching sun, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They have expressed their determination to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production" and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Not long ago, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in the Wuhan area created a serious political incident, which affected navigation and urban transportation. The proletarian revolutionary faction, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching that "the wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not avoid problems but will solve them with an active attitude, and any human difficulty can be overcome," have taken on the posture of masters and bravely and tenaciously entered the battle. Now, navigation on the Yangtze River is smooth and uninterrupted; all the city's lines are operating normally. The proletarian revolutionary factions in various factories, in implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," have all taken winning over and uniting the deceived masses as a major political task. On the one hand, they act as the main force on the production front with the posture of masters of the state; on the other hand, they also pay attention to doing political and ideological work among the deceived masses, making many deceived masses see clearly and raise their awareness, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, while firmly holding their production posts, also use methods such as home visits, individual connections, and heart-to-heart talks to do patient persuasion and education work among the deceived masses. Some of the deceived "Million Heroes" who left their production posts after being deceived have, through propaganda and education, seen through the tricks of the class enemy and gradually returned to their production posts. In many other factories and enterprises, workers who were originally deceived and left their workplaces have, through the active and serious work of the proletarian revolutionary faction, mostly returned to their workplaces and, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, grasp revolution and promote production, launching a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

	The People's Liberation Army soldiers fighting alongside the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Wuhan area also actively work with the proletarian revolutionary faction, jointly study Chairman Mao's works, hold "grasp revolution, promote production" symposiums, research production deployment, inspect production equipment, help solve production difficulties, and ensure the smooth progress of revolution and production.

    坚决响应毛主席伟大号召，誓作“抓革命，促生产”的模范
    武汉革命派勇挑革命生产两副重担
    他们注意做受蒙蔽群众的政治思想工作，原来受蒙蔽离开工作岗位的群众大部分又回到了工作岗位，同无产阶级革命派一道掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    编者按：经过艰苦斗争杀出来的武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，以国家主人翁的姿态，勇敢地挑起了革命、生产的两副重担。他们决心成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范。
    无产阶级革命派在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在各地区代理人进行大批判、大斗争的同时，还要努力维护无产阶级的新秩序，坚守生产岗位，保证正常生产。对受蒙蔽的群众要做深入细致的政治思想工作，以党的政策和自己的模范行动来教育、争取和团结他们，使他们尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。多争取一个群众，就多一份革命的力量，多一份生产的力量。
    我们高兴地看到，武汉的长江航运畅通无阻，市内交通运输线路正常通车，一些受骗离开生产岗位的群众，经过无产阶级革命派积极认真的工作，大部分都回到了工作岗位，并且和无产阶级革命派一道掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    新华社武汉十四日电  武汉地区无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，决心夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    连日来，武汉地区许多工厂、企业的无产阶级革命派战士和革命职工，冒着烈日酷暑，高举着毛主席巨幅画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，举行了“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会。他们表示，誓作“抓革命，促生产”的模范，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    前不久，武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一手制造了严重的政治事件，航运、市内交通曾受到影响。无产阶级革命派牢记毛主席“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的”这一教导，以主人翁的姿态，英勇顽强地投入了战斗。现在，长江航运畅通无阻；全市各条线路也都正常通车。各工厂的无产阶级革命派在贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，都把争取团结受蒙蔽的群众，作为一项重大的政治任务。他们一方面以国家主人翁的姿态，充当生产战线上的主力军；另一方面，他们也很注意做受蒙蔽的群众的政治思想工作，使不少受蒙蔽群众擦亮了眼睛，提高了认识，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。武汉重型机床厂的无产阶级革命派，一面坚守生产岗位，一面通过登门访问、个别串连、交心谈心等方法，向受蒙蔽的群众进行耐心的说服教育工作。有些受骗离开生产岗位的“百万雄师”的群众经过宣传教育，识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，也逐渐回到了生产岗位。其他许多工厂、企业，原来受欺骗而离开工作岗位的工人，经过无产阶级革命派积极认真地工作，大部分都回到了工作岗位，并且和无产阶级革命派一道抓革命，促生产，掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    和武汉地区无产阶级革命派战斗在一起的人民解放军指战员也积极同无产阶级革命派一起，共同学习毛主席著作，召开“抓革命，促生产”座谈会，研究生产部署，检查生产设备，帮助解决生产中的困难，以保证革命和生产的顺利进行。
