London police authorities, on the 6th, in front of Hyde Park, which the British imperialists have long boasted as a "democratic paradise," unreasonably arrested three individuals who were selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other Chinese publications. They also subjected them to unreasonable "interrogation." This fascist atrocity by British imperialism once again exposed its ugly face of hating and fearing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the core.

In recent times, many British and Asian, African, and Latin American progressive individuals living in Britain, out of their love for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution, voluntarily use their Sunday rest time to sell "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Beijing Review," "Chinese Pictorial," and other Chinese books. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other Chinese books they sell are deeply welcomed by the British people.

On the afternoon of the 6th, right outside this so-called "democratic showcase" of Hyde Park, a group of British police openly arrested three individuals who were selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to passersby. The police authorities absurdly charged them with a ridiculous offense, claiming they violated Section 121, Clause 1 of the British "Highways Act": "Intentionally obstructing the entrance passage." The police's absurd pretext was immediately refuted by facts, because at that time, many other publications were also being sold outside the gates of Hyde Park, including revisionist publications from the Soviet Union. The police did not interfere with those selling these publications, but specifically used fascist methods against those selling Chinese publications, forcibly seizing their beloved books, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other books, and dragging them onto police cars to the police station. When the police arrested them, one of the detainees shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" while another held up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," protesting against the fascist atrocities of the British police.

The police's actions infuriated the onlookers, with some immediately pointing out that this was a fascist act.

The London police authorities also subjected the three detainees to unreasonable "interrogation." The detainees declared their innocence in the "court."

The despicable actions of the London police authorities once again exposed the paper tiger nature of British imperialism. It attempts to use fascist atrocities to stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, which is utterly futile.

    英帝对毛泽东思想恨得要命怕得要死
    伦敦警察当局竟无理逮捕出售《毛主席语录》的人
    新华社伦敦八日电 伦敦警察当局六日在英帝国主义一向标榜为“民主乐园”的海德公园前，无理逮捕了三个正在出售《毛主席语录》和其他中国出版物的人士，并对他们进行了无理“审讯”。英帝国主义的这一法西斯暴行再一次暴露了它对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死、恨得要命的丑恶嘴脸。
    最近一个时期以来，许多英国和亚非拉旅英进步人士，出于对中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，自愿利用星期天休息时间，出售《毛主席语录》、《北京周报》、《中国画报》以及其他中国书籍。他们卖出的《毛主席语录》和其他中国书籍深受英国人民的欢迎。
    六日下午，就在这个被标榜为“民主橱窗”的海德公园外面，一群英国警察公然逮捕了三个正向过往行人出售《毛主席语录》的人士。警察当局竟给他们强加上荒唐可笑的“罪名”，说什么他们违犯了英国“公路法”第一二一条第一款：“有意阻塞门口通道”。警察的这种荒唐借口当场就被事实戳穿，因为当时在海德公园门外出售的还有许多其他出版物，其中包括来自苏联的修正主义出版物。警察对出售这种出版物的人不加过问，而唯独对出卖中国出版物的人施展法西斯手段，强行夺去他们出售的全世界人民心爱的宝书《毛主席语录》和其他书籍，并把他们拖上警车，押往警察局。三位被逮捕者在警察逮捕他们时，有的高呼“毛主席万岁！”有的高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，对英国警察的法西斯暴行表示抗议。
    警察的这一暴行激起了在场群众的愤怒，有些人当场指出这是一种法西斯行为。
    伦敦警察当局还对三位被捕者进行了无理的“审讯”。被捕者在“法庭”上义正词严地宣布他们无罪。
    伦敦警察当局的这一卑劣行径，再次暴露了英帝国主义的纸老虎本质，它企图用法西斯暴行来阻止毛泽东思想的传播，这完全是徒劳的。
