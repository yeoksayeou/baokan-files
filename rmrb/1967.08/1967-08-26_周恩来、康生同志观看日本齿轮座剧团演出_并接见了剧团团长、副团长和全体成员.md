Central leaders Zhou Enlai and Kang Sheng watched the Japanese Gear Seats Theater Troupe's performance of the play "Wildfire" this evening.

During the intermission, Zhou Enlai and Kang Sheng met with the Gear Seats Theater Troupe's director Fujikawa Natsuko, deputy director Hikari Yoshihisa, secretary-general Kanamaru Chikami, and administrative director Harada Takeo, as well as all the troupe members. They had a warm and friendly conversation. During the meeting, Japanese revolutionary artists enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The Japanese revolutionary artists' performance, full of revolutionary spirit, was warmly welcomed by the entire audience. When the performance ended, Zhou Enlai and Kang Sheng walked onto the stage to congratulate them on their successful performance. At that moment, the Japanese revolutionary artists and the entire audience waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" They sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" loudly together.

Japanese friends in Beijing, such as Nishizono Koichi, also watched the performance. (Photo attached)
