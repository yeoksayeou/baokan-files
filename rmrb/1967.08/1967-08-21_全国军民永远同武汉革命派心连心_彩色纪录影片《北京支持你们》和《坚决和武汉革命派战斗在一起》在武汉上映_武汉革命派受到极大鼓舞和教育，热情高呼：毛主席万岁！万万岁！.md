The color documentary films "Beijing Supports You" and "Firmly Stand with the Wuhan Revolutionary Faction in the Fight" began their grand premiere in over forty cinemas in Wuhan on August 17.

These two films truthfully record and reflect the situation where the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the broad masses of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing and Shanghai are wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the Wuhan region. The revolutionary factions of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in Wuhan, after watching the films, were greatly inspired and deeply educated. Whenever the screen showed our dearest leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi, and Comrade Wang Li, the audience immediately became extremely excited and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The broad revolutionary factions of the proletariat in Wuhan, after watching the films, excitedly expressed: "Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao. The river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as class love." The support from Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, as well as the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the People's Liberation Army in Beijing, Shanghai, and throughout the nation, is the greatest care for the Wuhan revolutionary factions. We must firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, resolutely expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, and complete the great historical task of one struggle, two criticisms, and three transformations. Many revolutionary factions of the proletariat and revolutionary youngsters expressed their determination to learn humbly from the revolutionary factions of the proletariat nationwide, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strengthen unity, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

Some units' revolutionary factions of the proletariat, in order to win over, unite with, and educate the misled masses, specially organized screenings of the films for their misled comrades and held discussions. The misled masses of the Hubei Provincial Drama Troupe said excitedly in the discussion meeting: The film gave us a vivid lesson in class struggle. We joined the wrong side and were deceived by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Wuhan region. We hate them and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" and the "Public Prosecution and Law Enforcement" who persist in the capitalist reactionary line. We not only want to withdraw from these organizations organizationally but also ideologically. We are determined to turn around and draw a clear line between the revolutionary line of the proletariat and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, learn from the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, and strive to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of the proletariat as soon as possible. The glorious film industry revolutionary factions of the province and city, who accepted the screening task, expressed: To express our gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for their deep concern, and to the revolutionary factions of the proletariat nationwide for their strong support, we must, with the greatest enthusiasm and the highest quality, do a good job in the distribution, screening, and promotion of these two films.

    武汉革命派受到极大鼓舞和教育，热情高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    新华社武汉十八日电　彩色纪录影片《北京支持你们》和《坚决和武汉革命派战斗在一起》，十七日开始在武汉四十多家电影院同时隆重上映。
    这两部影片真实地纪录和反映了首都、上海的无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员全力支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派的情况。武汉无产阶级革命派和革命群众看了影片，无不受到极大的鼓舞和深刻的教育。每当银幕上出现我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理、谢富治副总理和王力同志的时候，人们立即万分激动地热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    武汉广大无产阶级革命派看完影片后激动地表示：爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲，河深海深，不如阶级友爱深。毛主席、党中央、中央军委、中央文革小组以及首都、上海、全国的无产阶级革命派和中国人民解放军对武汉革命派的支持，是对我们武汉革命派的最大关怀。我们一定要高举革命的批判大旗，誓把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人统统揪出来批倒批臭，胜利完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务。许多无产阶级革命派和革命小将表示，一定要虚心地向全国无产阶级革命派学习，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，加强团结，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    有的单位的无产阶级革命派为了争取、团结、教育受蒙蔽的群众，特地组织本单位受蒙蔽的同志观看了影片，并举行了座谈。湖北省话剧团受蒙蔽的群众在座谈会上激动地说，影片给我们上了一堂活生生的阶级斗争教育课，我们站错了队，上了武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当，我们恨死了他们，恨死了“百万雄师”和“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头。我们不但要从组织上而且要从思想上退出这些组织，我们决心反戈一击，划清无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的界限，向无产阶级革命派学习，争取尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。光荣接受放映任务的省、市电影界无产阶级革命派表示：为了感谢毛主席、党中央、中央军委、中央文革小组的深切关怀，感谢全国无产阶级革命派的大力支持，一定要以最大的热情，最高的质量，把这两部影片的发行、放映、宣传工作做好。
