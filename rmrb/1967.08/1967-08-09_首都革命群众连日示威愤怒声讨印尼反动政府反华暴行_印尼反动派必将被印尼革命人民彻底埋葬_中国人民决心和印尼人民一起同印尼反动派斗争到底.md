The revolutionary masses and Red Guards of the capital have continued to hold massive demonstrations in scorching heat, expressing their outrage at the new anti-China atrocities committed by the Indonesian reactionary government led by Suharto and Nasution. The demonstrators declared that the 700 million people of China are determined to stand with the Indonesian people and fight to the end against the Indonesian reactionaries.

Over the past three days, more than 600,000 revolutionary masses and Red Guards have participated in the demonstrations. They unanimously expressed their strongest support for the urgent and strongest protest note issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian reactionary government. They also sternly warned the Indonesian reactionary government: A handful of reactionaries in Indonesia escalating their anti-China actions will only backfire, inciting greater resistance from the Indonesian people and hastening the end of the Indonesian reactionaries.

In recent days, the streets in front of the Indonesian Embassy have been filled with demonstrators. The sky resounds with angry slogans, and the walls in front of the embassy are covered with large-character posters, big-character posters, propaganda posters, and cartoons denouncing the Indonesian reactionary government's creation of anti-China atrocities. Representatives of the revolutionary masses handed over a large number of protest letters to the Indonesian embassy officials. People also directed loudspeakers at the Indonesian embassy, angrily condemning the new anti-China atrocities committed by the Suharto and Nasution reactionary government.

The revolutionary masses and Red Guards participating in the demonstrations pointed out that the recent anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities in Indonesia are entirely planned and organized by the Suharto-Nasution reactionary government. This is a new signal of their further anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. The demonstrators strongly declared that the Indonesian reactionaries are just a few buzzing flies. The 700 million people of China are determined to stand with the Indonesian people and fight to the end against the Indonesian reactionaries. The final victory will definitely belong to the Chinese people! It will belong to the Indonesian people!

In a protest letter, the revolutionary workers of the capital stated: Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The Indonesian reactionaries have committed numerous crimes and owe a mountain of debts. The Chinese people and all revolutionary people around the world will never forgive these murderers. Now, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian revolutionary people have taken up arms and are bravely fighting against the rightist military regime. The sparks of revolutionary armed struggle will surely become a raging inferno sweeping across the archipelago. The Suharto-Nasution clique will definitely be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary people!

The Chinese workers at the Indonesian Embassy in China also participated in the demonstrations and handed over a protest letter to the Indonesian embassy, expressing their strongest protest against the Indonesian reactionary government.

    新华社八日讯　首都革命群众和红卫兵小将今天冒着酷暑，继续举行强大的示威游行，愤怒声讨以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动政府的反华新暴行。示威群众表示，七亿中国人民决心和印尼人民一起同印尼反动派斗争到底。
    三天来，参加示威游行的革命群众和红卫兵小将有六十多万人。他们共同表示最坚决地支持我国外交部向印尼反动政府提出的最紧急最强烈的抗议照会，并且严正警告印尼反动政府：印尼一小撮反动派加剧反华，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，促使印尼人民更大的反抗，促使印尼反动派的末日更快的到来。
    连日来，在印尼驻华大使馆前面的街道上，示威的群众络绎不绝，愤怒的口号声响彻云霄，大使馆门前的墙上贴满了抗议印尼反动政府制造反华暴行的大字标语、大字报、宣传画和漫画。革命群众的代表向印尼使馆官员递交了大批抗议书，人们还把广播喇叭对着印尼使馆，愤怒地谴责苏哈托、纳苏蒂安反动政府制造的反华新暴行。
    游行示威的革命群众和红卫兵小将指出，最近在印尼发生的反华排华新暴行，完全是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政府有计划、有组织策划的，是他们进一步反华排华的新信号。示威的群众强烈表示，印尼反动派不过是几个嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，七亿中国人民决心和印尼人民一起同印尼反动派斗争到底。最后胜利一定属于中国人民！属于印尼人民！首都革命职工在抗议书中说：血债一定要用血来还。印尼反动派作恶多端，欠债累累，中国人民和全世界革命人民绝对饶不了这些杀人的刽子手。现在，印尼革命人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，已经拿起武器，同右派军人政权进行英勇的搏斗，革命武装斗争的星星之火，必将成为燃遍千岛之国的燎原大火，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安之流一定会被革命人民彻底埋葬！
