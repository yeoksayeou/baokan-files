The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government has committed a new fascist atrocity, which is a planned action to completely sever diplomatic relations between the two countries. This fully exposes the shameful face of a small group of Indonesian reactionaries, who are even more Nazi-like than the Nazis themselves, and they will inevitably face severe punishment from the Indonesian people and people around the world.

New China News Agency, August 6th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on August 6th, expressing the most urgent and strongest protest against the Indonesian fascist military regime for mobilizing military police and mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia again. The note demands that the Indonesian reactionary government immediately apologize for the incident, severely punish the criminals, compensate for all the losses of the Chinese Embassy, and guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy and its staff. It also demands that the Indonesian government stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities immediately.

The note states that the attack on the Chinese Embassy on August 5th is a new signal of the Indonesian reactionary government's further anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. It is a planned action to completely sever diplomatic relations between the two countries. The note sternly warns the Indonesian government: Your actions will inevitably face severe condemnation and punishment from the Indonesian people and people around the world. The more you tighten your anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, the sooner your doom will come.

The note sternly demands that the Indonesian government: immediately apologize publicly for the above incident, severely punish the criminals, compensate for all the losses of the Chinese Embassy; effectively guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy and its staff; and immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

The note says: On the morning of August 5th, 1967, from 8:50 AM to 11:30 AM, under the leadership and coordination of a large number of Indonesian armed forces, more than a thousand mobs rammed open the gate of the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta with trucks, shouting anti-China slogans, and rushed into the compound to carry out a mad attack. The mobs, armed with axes, iron bars, and daggers, acted savagely, injuring Consul Su Sheng and three staff members, He Huajun, Guo Hao, and Chen Jun. All the furniture and equipment inside the embassy buildings were smashed, and two buildings were set on fire. What is even more intolerable is that they dared to tear down the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the most beloved leader of the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, and smash the solemn and sacred national emblem of China. After the mobs' rampage, the Indonesian armed forces continued to surround and blockade the Chinese Embassy. Even when the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires, Lü Zibo, went to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest, he was rudely stopped by Indonesian military police.

The note says: The Indonesian reactionary government's latest planned and organized fascist violence attack on Chinese diplomatic institutions is obviously a long-planned move. In recent times, the leaders of the Indonesian reactionary government—Suharto, Nasution, and Malik—have been repeatedly calling for further anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. On the eve of this attack, the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship held a national military region commanders' meeting in Jakarta to plan specific steps for anti-China and anti-Chinese actions.

The note points out: The Indonesian reactionary government's push to escalate anti-China and anti-Chinese movements to a new height is driven by urgent needs in both domestic and foreign policies. The note says: Currently, Indonesia's economy is on the brink of complete collapse. Domestic class contradictions are extremely sharp, and the rule of the Suharto-Nasution reactionary military government is very unstable. Facing such serious difficulties, the Indonesian reactionary government has become even more subservient to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries, desperately seeking a few crumbs from them to alleviate their overall ruling crisis.

The note says: In order to shift domestic discontent and to adapt to the needs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and due to the Chinese people's firm support for the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, the Suharto-Nasution fascist dictatorship has repeatedly launched anti-China and anti-Chinese movements. Since October 1965, it has been nearly two years without interruption. But the facts have proven that their thoroughly treacherous, dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people counter-revolutionary policies over the past year have only further provoked strong resistance from the broad masses of the Indonesian people, accelerating the early arrival of the Indonesian revolutionary high tide.

The note says: The Chinese government sternly warns the Indonesian government: You will find no way out from your evil anti-China and anti-Chinese deeds. On the contrary, your mad anti-China actions will fully expose the shameful face of this small group of reactionaries, who are even more Nazi-like than the Nazis, and greatly insult the national dignity of 100 million Indonesian people.

The note concludes by saying: The Chinese government announces that it reserves the right to take further measures before receiving a satisfactory response from the Indonesian government regarding the above demands.

    最强烈抗议印尼反动派袭击我使馆
    我外交部照会指出：印尼反动政府制造新的法西斯暴行，是为了完全破裂两国外交关系而采取的有计划的行动，大大暴露了一小撮印尼反动分子比纳粹更加纳粹的可耻面目，必将遭到印尼人民和全世界人民的严厉惩罚。
    新华社六日讯　我国外交部六日照会印尼驻华大使馆，对印尼法西斯军人政权调动军警和暴徒又一次袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，向印尼反动政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，八月五日的袭击中国大使馆的事件，是印尼反动政府进一步反华排华的新信号，是它为了完全破裂两国外交关系而采取的有计划的行动。照会严正警告印尼政府：你们这样倒行逆施，必将遭到印尼人民和全世界人民的严厉谴责和惩罚。你们反华排华越加紧，你们的灭亡就会越快到来。
    照会严正要求印尼政府：立即就上述事件公开道歉，严惩凶犯，赔偿中国大使馆的一切损失；切实保证中国大使馆及其人员的安全；立即停止一切反华排华暴行。
    照会说：一九六七年八月五日上午八时五十分至十一时三十分，在大批印度尼西亚武装部队的带领和协同下，一千多名暴徒用卡车撞开雅加达中国大使馆大门，狂叫反华口号，冲进院内进行了疯狂袭击。暴徒们手持斧头、铁棍、匕首等凶器，野蛮行凶，当场打伤苏生领事和何怀钧、郭浩和、陈军等三名工作人员。大使馆房屋内的家具和设备全被砸毁，两座建筑物被纵火焚烧。尤其令人不能容忍的是，他们竟敢撕毁中国人民和世界革命人民最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的挂像，砸毁庄严神圣的中国国徽。暴徒行凶之后，印尼武装部队继续对中国大使馆进行包围和封锁。甚至当中国临时代办吕子波前往印尼外交部提抗议时，也竟然遭到印尼军警的蛮横阻拦。
    照会说：印尼反动政府这次又对中国驻印尼外交机构策划和组织新的法西斯暴力袭击，显然是蓄谋已久的。最近以来，印尼反动政府的头头——苏哈托、纳苏蒂安、马利克等，一直在叫嚣要进一步反华排华。就在这次袭击的前夜，印尼法西斯军事独裁政权，还在雅加达召开了全国军区司令会议，策划反华排华的具体步骤。
    照会指出：印尼反动政府之所以要把反华排华运动推到一个新的高峰，有其内政外交上的迫切需要。照会说：目前，印尼经济面临彻底崩溃的危险。国内阶级矛盾十分尖锐，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动军人政权的统治十分不稳。面对这种严重困难，印尼反动政府就更加向美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和日本反动派卖身投靠，妄图从他们那里乞讨一点残羹剩饭，来摆脱自己的全面统治危机。
    照会说：由于对内妄图转移人民不满，对外力求适应帝修反的需要，也由于中国人民坚决支持印尼人民革命斗争，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯独裁政权，一次又一次地掀起反华排华运动。自一九六五年十月以来，已持续了将近两年，一直没有间断。但事实证明，一年多来他们实行的彻头彻尾的卖国、独裁、反共、反华、反人民的反革命政策，只会更加激起印尼广大人民的强烈反抗，加速印尼革命高潮的早日到来。
    照会说：中国政府严正警告印尼政府：你们从反华排华的罪恶勾当中，是找不到任何出路的。恰恰相反，你们这样疯狂反华，就大大地暴露了你们这一小撮反动分子比纳粹更加纳粹的可耻面目，大大地侮辱了一亿印尼人民的民族尊严。
    照会最后说：中国政府宣布，在未接到印尼政府对上述要求作出圆满答复之前，保留采取进一步措施的权利。
