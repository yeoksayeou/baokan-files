The People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison troops held a grand celebration meeting with 10,000 participants today, enthusiastically celebrating the inscription by Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman of the Party and State, for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. The inscription reads: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The troops expressed their determination to respond enthusiastically to Vice Chairman Lin's call, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. They will deepen the "support the army and love the people" activities and achieve new merits in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "three supports, two military controls" work.

Today, the soldiers guarding Chairman Mao are immersed in boundless happiness. They joyfully carried the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and the quotations from Chairman Mao, holding up giant banners with Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions, and marched from all directions to the Beijing Workers' Stadium. Among them were the heroic soldiers who day and night guard Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group; there were also outstanding soldiers from the "three supports, two military controls" frontlines who resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary masses. They have created magnificent achievements in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; they have, in the "leftist" work, thought what the leftists think, hurried what the leftists hurry, helped what the leftists need, and stood shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary masses of the capital, forging a deep combat friendship.

In the center of the venue, a giant portrait of the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great navigator Chairman Mao was prominently displayed. On the stage, there was a giant plaque with Vice Chairman Lin's latest inscription. The soldiers were full of vigor and enthusiasm, loudly reading Chairman Mao's quotations: "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." "Do not rely on old merits, but achieve new merits," and loudly singing revolutionary songs. The entire venue was filled with a vibrant and joyful atmosphere.

Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Xie Fuzhi, spoke at the meeting. He said, Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is the greatest concern and encouragement for the Beijing Garrison and all the soldiers of the army. The People's Liberation Army is an army personally created and nurtured by Chairman Mao, personally led by Vice Chairman Lin; it is an army that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and is highly revolutionary. This army has been tested in past battles and has also been tested in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Practice has proven that this army is the greatest and most revolutionary army in the world. The Beijing Garrison troops are the troops guarding Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin. In the country, the "leftist" work of the Beijing Garrison is relatively good. This is the result of the broad masses of soldiers, under the care of the great leader Chairman Mao, responding to Vice Chairman Lin's call, and resolutely "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao." He called on all soldiers to be vigilant and avoid arrogance, to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, closely follow the Party Central Committee, and closely follow the Central Cultural Revolution Group. He hoped that the broad masses of soldiers, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, would firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely support the revolutionary leftists, help them achieve great unity and great criticism of the revolution, proceed forward to victory according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and achieve new merits for the people under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the midst of thunderous applause, the Commander of the Beijing Garrison, Fu Chongbi, loudly read the full text of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to the meeting and presented the giant plaque with Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to the representatives of the units under the Beijing Garrison. At this moment, the entire venue echoed with cheers: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Salute to Vice Chairman Lin!" "Firmly carry out Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" Maoyuqi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Garrison, read a letter of determination on behalf of all soldiers, stating: Your inscription is a great joyous event in the political life of the garrison troops, the greatest concern, encouragement, and spur, and the newest requirement. Your latest instructions are, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, timely, correct, and wise calls to arms issued to the troops in the new situation. At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, you have pointed out the direction for us. Your latest instructions are the order for mobilizing the troops to learn Chairman Mao's works to a new level; it is the call to arms for completing the glorious tasks of the "three supports, two military controls" and swearing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This instruction is of extremely great significance for strengthening the proletarian revolutionary construction of our army and will have a far-reaching impact on the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. All soldiers of the Beijing Garrison unanimously declared: We will definitely study, deeply understand, enthusiastically propagate, actively implement, and resolutely carry out your latest instructions.

Better and more excellently complete the glorious task of defending the capital.

In his speech, Chen Xianrui, the deputy political commissar of the Beijing Troops, first expressed warm congratulations on behalf of the Beijing Troops Party Committee and the leadership. He said: Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is the direction for our army's advance in the new historical period, the foundation for construction, the goal for struggle, the greatest concern, encouragement, and spur for us. This is Vice Chairman Lin's new and higher expectations and requirements for our army. It is a great encouragement and great motivation for us to complete the tasks of the "three supports, two military controls" and defend national defense, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the call to arms and order for mobilizing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to thoroughly bury the Chinese Khrushchev, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. He called on all soldiers to take immediate action, launch a campaign of great publicity, great mobilization, great inspection, and great implementation, to seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions.

At the meeting, Kong Xiangxiu, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Garrison, spoke on behalf of more than 500 active learners, saying: We wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Lin's inscription and will definitely understand and carry it out. We will, in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve new levels of study and application, and respond to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's concern and expectations with new achievements.
