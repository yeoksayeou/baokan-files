In the days of national celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army by Chairman Mao, the PLA troops stationed in Shanghai held a grand rally today. They enthusiastically hailed the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and soldiers of Wuhan. They hailed the great achievements of the revolutionary masses and soldiers of Wuhan in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They resolved to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism to firmly support the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and to thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military. They vowed to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage of victory.

One hundred thousand revolutionary masses of Shanghai participated in the rally, fully supporting the revolutionary actions of the three services stationed in Shanghai.

Today's rally fully demonstrated the spirit of unity, mutual support, and joint struggle between the broad masses of soldiers stationed in Shanghai and Wuhan, as well as the revolutionary masses. It was also a rally where the soldiers stationed in Shanghai, the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary cadres vowed to launch a new high tide of exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military, represented by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is excellent. The broad masses of soldiers stationed in Shanghai, who have made immortal contributions in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, are, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, together with the revolutionary masses of Shanghai and Wuhan, and the revolutionary masses nationwide, united in their hatred and anger, and loudly condemning the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan. They have received a vivid class struggle education and a profound education on the two-line struggle. The broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres have grasped the direction of the struggle more firmly, directing their spears at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military, launching a new high tide of exposure, criticism, and struggle. They proudly declared that to deeply and thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects is the most powerful support for the revolutionary masses of Wuhan.

Today, the soldiers stationed in Shanghai, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, held high the red flags and the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao. They marched into the city center's People's Square with the revolutionary masses of various fronts, shoulder to shoulder. The square was filled with red flags. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians, who had formed deep bonds of friendship in the "January Revolution" red storm, sang songs of Mao's quotations together and shouted slogans in unison: "Down with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party!" "Down with the great warlord, great schemer, and great conspirator Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing!" "Firmly support the letter from the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary masses and soldiers of Wuhan!" "Firmly support the revolutionary masses of Wuhan!" "Down with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan! Down with the bad leaders who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line in the 'Million Heroes' and 'Public Prosecution and Law'!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!"

The leaders of the PLA's three services stationed in Shanghai, including Liao Zhengguo, Li Shiyang, Liu Wenxue, Rao Shoukun, Liu Haotian, Zhou Renjie, Gao Zhirong, Mei Jiasheng, Duan Dezhang, Wang Weiguo, Yu Guangmao, Zhang Jihou, Zhang Yiai, Li Binshan, Zhang Qiangsheng, Ji Yingwu, Ji Shitang, Gu Hong, Xie Zhenghao, Nan Pingbo, and Li Hongjun, attended today's rally.

The leading members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Wang Shaoyong, Ma Tianhui, Xu Jingxian, Wang Chenglong, Wang Hongwen, Lu Wencai, Chen Linhu, Feng Guozhu, Li Yanyu, and Zhu Sixi, as well as the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, also attended the rally.

Revolutionary comrades from Wuhan and other regions who are currently in Shanghai also participated in today's rally with the determination to fight together with the soldiers stationed in Shanghai and the revolutionary masses.

In his speech, the representative of the soldiers stationed in Shanghai once again fully expressed the determination to firmly support the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

They said: The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and soldiers of Wuhan has not only brought immense impetus to the flourishing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan but is also the deepest concern, most resolute support, greatest encouragement, and strongest spur for the soldiers and revolutionary masses nationwide. We firmly support and will definitely carry out the instructions. The class struggle storm in Wuhan has exposed the true faces of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The current revolutionary situation is excellent. The better the revolutionary situation, the more we must heighten our vigilance and never be complacent or relaxed. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military who have been exposed are like fallen dogs, injured tigers, and not yet frozen snakes. We must not pity these pests. We must keep our eyes open, pursue victory, and thoroughly criticize them from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects!

The representative of the soldiers stationed in Shanghai also said in his speech: We and the soldiers of the three services and the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, although thousands of miles apart, our hearts are together, and our struggle targets are the same. We are the people's army created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. We are the strong pillars of the proletarian dictatorship and the faithful defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the broad revolutionary masses. We will fight for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Amidst warm applause, the rally read out a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The telegram said: We, the soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, solemnly declare: We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forever be the most loyal executors and defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, whoever dares to direct their spears at Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the proletarian headquarters represented by Chairman Mao, they are our sworn enemies, and we will definitely knock them down and make them never rise again! We, the soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "supporting the army and loving the people," forever unite with the revolutionary masses of Shanghai, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, and the revolutionary masses nationwide, fight together, and win together. We will further do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

After the rally, the soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai and the revolutionary masses of Shanghai held a demonstration march together. (Photos attached)
