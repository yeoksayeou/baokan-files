Title: Save Coal When Burning It

I am an employee of the Beijing Municipal Coal Conservation Office for the Market. From recent observations, I have found that there is a significant potential for saving coal. Based on a survey of over a thousand collective canteens, the average coal consumption for cooking one pound of grain (including cooking meals) is about one pound. Wasteful units use four pounds, while conservative units use only three to four ounces of coal. In terms of heating, according to the statistics of the winter of 1966, advanced units consume about 16.5 kilograms of coal per square meter over the entire winter, average units consume 28 to 30 kilograms, and wasteful households consume as much as 60 kilograms. The difference in coal consumption between thrifty and wasteful residents is also significant.

The reason for such a large disparity in coal consumption is mainly that some comrades do not pay enough attention to conserving coal. They believe that "saving is not part of their job," so they only focus on cooking without considering saving coal. Or they think that "the country is so large, saving a bit of coal doesn't amount to much, it's not worth the effort."

I believe that this attitude of "not caring about saving coal" is incorrect and does not consider the interests of the state or the revolution. We should follow Chairman Mao's call to "save and make revolution" and do everything possible to conserve coal.

Postscript:
Coal is the lifeblood of industry. The production and consumption of coal are related to the construction of socialism in our country, to industrial and agricultural production, to the lives of urban and rural people, and to the successful conduct of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, in addition to the revolutionary cadres on the coal industry front who are striving to develop coal production and complete the state plan efficiently, conserving coal is a major task. Coal conservation work has already been initiated in many places and has achieved some success. However, there are still places where coal is wasted. If everyone pays attention to saving coal, the amount saved nationwide would be considerable. Today's letter published in this newspaper shows that the coal consumption for cooking one pound of grain differs by more than tenfold between wasteful and conservative units, indicating that the potential for saving coal is enormous.

Saving and wasting are a struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies, a political issue, not a trivial matter. Proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people should actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and "save and make revolution." They should overcome the idea of "not caring about using more" and firmly establish the thought of hard struggle, frugal construction, and "saving coal for the revolution." They should plug all loopholes and do everything possible to save coal, contributing to the socialist construction of the country.

### 烧煤要注意节约

    烧煤要注意节约
    我是北京市市场用煤节约办公室的一名职工，从最近了解到的一些情况看，节约煤炭的潜力很大。根据对一千多个集体食堂的调查，以做熟每斤粮食（包括做菜）的耗煤量计算，平均是一斤一两，浪费的单位需要四斤，而节约的单位只用三、四两煤。暖气方面，根据一九六六年冬季的统计，先进的单位全冬每平方米耗煤十六公斤多，一般的在二十八至三十公斤，浪费的户则要六十公斤。居民用煤省费之间的差距也很大。
    为什么烧煤会有这样大的差距，主要是有些同志对节约用煤没引起重视，认为“节约不是份内事”，因此只管做饭，不管节煤，或者认为，“国家这么大，省一些煤值不了几个钱，油水不大”。
    我认为这种烧煤“不在乎”的想法，是不对的，不是为国家利益着想，为革命利益着想的。我们应该按照毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的号召，千方百计地节约煤炭。

    编后
    煤炭是工业的粮食。煤炭的生产和消耗，关系到我国社会主义建设，关系到工农业生产，关系到城乡人民生活，也关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。因此，除了煤炭工业战线上的革命派，鼓足干劲，发展煤炭生产，多快好省地完成国家计划外，节约煤炭是一件大事。现在节约煤炭工作在很多地方已经开展起来，并且取得了不少成绩。但有些地方浪费煤炭的现象还是存在的，如果大家都注意节约用煤，从全国来看数量就相当可观了。从今天本报发表的这封来信说明，做熟一斤粮食的耗煤量，浪费的和节约的数字，相差竟达十倍以上，可见节约煤炭的潜力是很大的。
    节约和浪费是无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想的斗争，是一个政治问题，不是一件小事情。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，都应当积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，克服“多用点不在乎”的思想，牢固地树立艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，“为革命而节煤”的思想，堵塞一切漏洞，千方百计地节约用煤，为国家社会主义建设作出贡献。
