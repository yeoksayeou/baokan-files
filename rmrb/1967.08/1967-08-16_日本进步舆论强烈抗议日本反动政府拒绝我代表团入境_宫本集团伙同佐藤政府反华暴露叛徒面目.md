The Japanese reactionary government, under the leadership of Sato, has been pursuing a reactionary policy of following the U.S. imperialists, stubbornly maintaining an antagonistic stance towards the Chinese people. On August 11, it brazenly and unreasonably refused entry to the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association visiting Japan.

The delegation, led by Zhou Peiyuan, was invited by the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) to participate in the 16th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) scheduled for late June and to conduct a two-month friendly visit to various parts of Japan. However, due to the Sato reactionary government's delaying tactics on the issue of the delegation's entry, the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Miyamoto, has been secretly advising the Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese reactionary government has been refusing to issue entry visas to the delegation, and on the 11th, it brazenly decided to refuse the delegation's entry.

The revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Miyamoto, colluded with the Japanese reactionaries to advise the Sato government on its hostile policy towards China, its sabotage of the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries, and its refusal to allow the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association to enter the country. This fully exposed the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Miyamoto, as traitors who are anti-China, counter-revolutionary, anti-people, and who have sold themselves to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The reactionary actions of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in collusion with the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party to obstruct the entry of the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association have been strongly opposed by many progressive organizations and the broad masses of the Japanese people. Since late June, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan Socialist Party have been fighting with the Sato government, demanding that the Sato government unconditionally agree to the delegation's entry. Subsequently, 150 representatives from Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, and other places involved in the Japan-China friendship movement stormed the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Prime Minister's Office, strongly condemning the Sato government's unreasonable obstruction of the delegation's entry. In July, 400 representatives involved in Japan-China friendly trade held an emergency meeting in Tokyo, strongly opposing the Sato government's hostile policy towards China and firmly demanding that the Japanese authorities immediately and unconditionally agree to the entry of the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association. People from various sectors in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and other major cities have held meetings to protest against the Sato government's sabotage of friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries and to condemn the Sato government and the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, led by Miyamoto, for their despicable collusion in obstructing the delegation's entry.

    日本进步舆论强烈抗议日本反动政府拒绝我代表团入境
    宫本集团伙同佐藤政府反华暴露叛徒面目
    据新华社东京电日　本佐藤反动政府奉行追随美帝国主义的反动政策，坚持与中国人民为敌，八月十一日悍然无理拒绝中日友好协会访日代表团入境。
    由周培源率领的中日友好协会访日代表团应日中友好协会（正统）总部的邀请，原定在六月下旬前往日本参加日中友好协会（正统）总部召开的第十六次全国大会并到日本各地进行两个月的友好访问。但是，由于佐藤反动政府对中日友好协会访日代表团的入境问题采取拖延政策，日共宫本修正主义集团在幕后向日本反动派献媚献策，日本反动政府一直拒发代表团入境签证，十一日竟悍然作出拒绝代表团入境的决定。
    日共宫本修正主义集团同日本反动派串通一气，为佐藤政府敌视中国、破坏日中两国人民的友好关系以及拒绝中日友好协会访日代表团的入境问题，献媚献策。这就完全暴露了日共宫本修正主义集团反华、反革命、反人民，卖身投靠美日反动派的叛徒面目。
    美日反动派同日共宫本修正主义集团合谋，阻挠中日友好协会访日代表团入境的反动行径遭到日本许多进步团体和日本广大人民的强烈反对。从今年六月下旬以来，日中友好协会（正统）总部、日本社会党同佐藤政府进行斗争，要求佐藤政府无条件地同意代表团入境，随后，东京、大阪、兵库等地从事日中友好运动的代表一百五十人大闹法务省、外务省和首相府，强烈谴责佐藤政府无理阻挠代表团入境。从事日中友好贸易的代表四百人七月间在东京举行紧急会议，强烈反对佐藤政府敌视中国的政策，坚决要求日本当局立即无条件地同意中日友好协会访日代表团入境。东京、大阪、京都各大城市的各界人士先后举行大会抗议佐藤政府破坏日中两国人民的友好往来，谴责佐藤政府和日共宫本修正主义集团串通一气，阻挠代表团入境的卑劣行径。
