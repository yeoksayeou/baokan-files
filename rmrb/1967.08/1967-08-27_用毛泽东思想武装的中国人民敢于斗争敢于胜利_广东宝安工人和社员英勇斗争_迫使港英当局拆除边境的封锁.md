Workers and commune members of Guangdong's Bao'an County bravely fight back, forcing the British authorities in Hong Kong to remove border blockades

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 26th, workers from the Luohu Production Team of Huabei Brigade in Jucheng Commune, Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, and porters from Wenjindu, have been engaged in a resolute struggle against the British authorities in Hong Kong since the 24th. The British authorities have been blocking border passages and disrupting the normal lives of border residents. The workers and commune members have bravely and tenaciously fought back against the enemy's tear gas and incendiary bombs. With the support of the People's Liberation Army border defense troops, they have forced the British authorities to remove the barbed wire blocking the border passages, once again exposing the true nature of the British paper tiger.

At 8 a.m. on the 24th, 44 male and female commune members from the Luohu Production Team, following traditional customs, crossed the Luohu Bridge to till fields in the New Territories. When the commune members passed by the Hong Kong immigration office, eight reactionary reporters summoned by the British side attempted to take photographs of them. The commune members immediately refused and pointed out that this was an unreasonable provocation by the British authorities. A British official arrogantly stated that the commune members would not be allowed to cross the border if they did not have their photographs taken. The commune members were extremely indignant at the British authorities' unreasonable behavior and seized a recording device from the reactionary reporters. The British officials then fired four tear gas canisters and one incendiary bomb at the commune members, injuring eight people on the spot.

In the afternoon, the commune members went to the bridgehead to protest against the British authorities' unreasonable disruption of normal border crossing procedures and their injury of the commune members working across the border. Revolutionary masses from the Customs, Overseas Chinese Service Corporation, and other units rushed to the scene to support them. The British authorities not only did not accept the commune members' protest but also continuously fired 63 tear gas canisters and one incendiary bomb, injuring another 17 commune members, three of whom were seriously injured. The enemy's fascist atrocities were met with resolute resistance from the commune members and revolutionary masses. The People's Liberation Army border defense troops also issued the strongest and most urgent warning to the British authorities. Subsequently, the commune members, holding high red flags, portraits of Chairman Mao, and quotations from Chairman Mao, marched bravely to the bridgehead to cross the border and work. They sang the song "All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" by Chairman Mao and shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with British Imperialism!" as they passed by the Hong Kong immigration office. When the commune members returned to the bridgehead on our side, they were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of Shenzhen.

At 2:15 p.m. on the 24th, porters from Wenjindu went to the bridgehead to inspect the situation at the bridgehead, which had been unreasonably blocked by the British authorities since the 10th. The British police and soldiers madly fired tear gas at the workers, provoking their great anger. The workers expressed their determination to remove the barbed wire at the bridgehead and thoroughly defeat the British authorities' shameless provocation. The border defense troops also fired warning shots at the British police and soldiers. However, the British police and soldiers continued to brutally suppress the unarmed workers, firing a total of 136 tear gas canisters and 18 incendiary bombs. Some of the tear gas and incendiary bombs landed on our side, injuring 13 people, two of whom were seriously injured. They also fired 49 shots at us in provocation. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of Wenjindu once again demonstrated their heroic spirit of daring to struggle and not fearing sacrifice. They carried their injured comrades, extinguished the flames on their bodies, and used wet towels to block the tear gas. They fought bravely in the thick smoke and fire, and finally, at 6 p.m., completely removed the barbed wire blocking the bridgehead set up by the British authorities and returned to our side in victory. The British authorities, unwilling to accept their defeat, secretly set up another barbed wire fence at the bridgehead early on the 25th, attempting to continue the blockade. The British authorities' new provocation enraged our workers and commune members even more. The People's Liberation Army border defense troops also issued a serious warning to the British authorities, declaring that the British authorities must remove all obstacles and ensure the safety of our border-crossing masses. Under the stern warning of the People's Liberation Army, the British authorities were forced to accept our conditions and hurriedly sent a British official with eight soldiers to the bridgehead to hastily remove the barbed wire they had just set up. Workers and commune members preparing to cross the border at the bridgehead shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with British Imperialism!" and crossed the border to deliver goods and work in victory.

    用毛泽东思想武装的中国人民敢于斗争敢于胜利
    广东宝安工人和社员英勇斗争  迫使港英当局拆除边境的封锁
    据新华社广州二十六日电　广东省宝安县附城公社湖贝大队罗湖生产队社员和文锦渡搬运工人，从二十四日以来连续对港英当局封锁边境通道，破坏边境人民正常生活秩序的无耻挑衅行为进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们在敌人的催泪弹、燃烧弹面前英勇顽强，毫不畏惧，终于在我人民解放军边防部队的支援下，迫使港英当局拆除封锁边境通道的铁丝网，又一次戳穿了港英纸老虎的原形。
    二十四日清晨八点，罗湖生产队的四十四名男女社员按照传统习惯，经罗湖桥去新界耕田。社员们路经港英罗湖移民局门口的时候，英方事先召来的八名香港反动记者要我社员逐个拍照。我社员当即坚决拒绝，并指出这是港英当局对我的无理挑衅。英方官员竟蛮横地说什么我社员不拍照就不许过境生产。我社员对港英当局这种蛮不讲理的行为万分愤慨，并且夺下了香港反动记者的一部录音机。港英官员这时竟对我社员发射四发催泪弹和一发燃烧弹，当场烧伤我群众八人。
    下午，我方社员走上桥头，对港英当局无理破坏过境正常秩序、伤害我过境耕作社员的挑衅行为提出严重抗议。我海关、华侨服务社等单位的革命群众闻讯后也赶来声援。港英当局不但不接受我社员的抗议，竟然连续施放催泪弹六十三发、燃烧弹一发，又打伤我社员十七人，其中重伤三人。敌人的法西斯暴行遭到我社员和革命群众的坚决反击。我人民解放军边防部队也向港英当局提出最紧急最强烈警告。接着，社员们随即雄赳赳气昂昂地高举红旗、毛主席像和毛主席语录走上桥头过境生产。他们走到港英移民局门前，齐声歌唱《一切反动派都是纸老虎》的毛主席语录歌，并振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒英帝国主义！”等口号。社员们回到我方桥头时，受到了深圳各界革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    二十四日下午两点十五分，我文锦渡的搬运工人到桥头察看从十日起被港英当局无理封锁的桥头情况。港英军警疯狂地向我工人施放催泪弹进行挑衅，激起了工人的极大愤怒。他们表示一定要拆除桥头的铁丝网，彻底击败港英当局的无耻挑衅。我边防部队也向港英军警鸣枪警告。但港英军警竟然继续对我手无寸铁的工人进行残酷镇压，连续向我工人施放了一百三十六发催泪弹、十八发燃烧弹，一些催泪弹和燃烧弹打到我方境内，打伤我群众十三人，其中重伤二人；同时还向我开枪挑衅四十九次。用毛泽东思想武装起来的文锦渡工人再一次表现了敢于斗争、不怕牺牲的英雄气概，他们背下负伤的战友，扑灭身上的火焰，用湿毛巾挡住了催泪弹的毒气，在浓烟烈火中奋战，终于在下午六时全部拆除了港英封锁桥头的铁丝网后，胜利地返回我方。港英当局不甘心他们的失败，二十五日清晨又偷偷摸摸地在桥头架设了一道铁丝网，企图继续封锁通道。港英当局新的挑衅行为，激起了我工人和社员的更大愤怒。我人民解放军边防部队也向港英当局提出严重警告，宣布港英当局必须拆除一切障碍，保证我过境群众的安全。在我人民解放军的严正警告下，港英当局被迫接受我方条件，急急忙忙由一名英国官员领着八个士兵，到桥头慌慌张张地拆除了他们自己刚刚架设不久的铁丝网。在桥头准备过境的我工人和社员，高呼“毛主席万岁”“打倒英帝”等口号，胜利地过境送货和生产。
