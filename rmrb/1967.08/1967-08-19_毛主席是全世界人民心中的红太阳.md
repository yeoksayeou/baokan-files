While watching the color documentary "Long Live Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line," my heart was beating in unison with the revolutionary masses on the screen. The scenes of the people's boundless love for the leader and the leader's boundless love for the people made me feel as if I was not watching a movie but reliving the moving scenes I had witnessed in person in front of Tiananmen Gate.

We, the soldiers guarding Tiananmen Gate, often see many vivid examples of the revolutionary people of the nation and the world loving Chairman Mao. Countless Red Guards come to Tiananmen Gate, and the first thing they do is salute and pledge to Chairman Mao's portrait, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" Then they loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations and sing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." On the night of May 1st, a few Red Guards from Shandong excitedly told us, "Soldier uncles, we saw our most beloved Chairman Mao today. He is so healthy, truly the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world."

One day, a few blind people from Shanxi came to Tiananmen Gate and asked us, "Where did Chairman Mao walk?" We told them about how on May 1st and the night of the National Day last year, Chairman Mao watched the fireworks with the masses. They were overjoyed and started touching the place where Chairman Mao had sat. Tears streaming down their faces, they said, "Chairman Mao! Although we cannot see you, our red hearts will forever be with you!"

Forty-one overseas Chinese youths who returned from Indonesia came straight to Tiananmen Gate and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, loudly reciting a poem they collectively created while fighting against the Indonesian reactionaries: "Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts. When we are beaten by the enemy, we think of you, and we become fearless, our wills like steel. Even if the enemy uses bayonets to cut open our chests, what they will find is only hearts red with loyalty to Chairman Mao and the motherland..."

All the people of China love Chairman Mao boundlessly, and the revolutionary people of the world also revere Chairman Mao boundlessly. We often see many foreign friends come to Tiananmen Gate, facing Chairman Mao's giant portrait, waving their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," cheering enthusiastically, and singing passionately. On the night celebrating our country's hydrogen bomb explosion, Albanian friends and Chinese Red Guards sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" by the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen Gate, shouting in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" They did not want to leave Tiananmen Gate until three o'clock in the morning. On May 1st, International Labor Day, foreign friends from all continents saw the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao. They looked at Chairman Mao with pairs of happy eyes and pairs of enthusiastic hands reaching out to Chairman Mao. A young woman from South Vietnam, upon seeing beloved Chairman Mao, was so moved that tears streamed down her face, and she tightly hugged Chairman Mao, unable to speak for a long time.

Many foreign friends and Red Guards from other provinces come to Tiananmen Gate before leaving Beijing to take photos in front of Chairman Mao's giant portrait as a keepsake. Some take a bit of soil from under Tiananmen Gate and a bottle of water from under the Golden Water Bridge to bring back as the most precious souvenirs. How many moving stories of loving Chairman Mao happen in front of Tiananmen Gate every day! How many people express their boundless love and longing for Chairman Mao in their own best ways!

The true stories that happen in front of Tiananmen Gate are countless and cannot be told in a few days and nights. From these few incidents, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world. We enthusiastically cheer for the new era of Mao Zedong Thought entering the world!

    毛主席是全世界人民心中的红太阳
    守卫天安门某部五好战士　徐政辉
    看着彩色纪录片《毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁》的时候，我的心一直在和影片中的革命群众一起激烈地跳动。人民无限爱领袖，领袖无限爱人民的场面，使我感到仿佛不是在看电影，而是重温在天安门前亲眼见到的那些动人的情景。
    我们在天安门前守卫的战士，经常看到全国和全世界革命人民热爱毛主席的许多生动事迹。多少红卫兵小将来到天安门前，第一件事就是向毛主席像敬礼宣誓，高呼“毛主席万岁”、“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”；接着就高声朗读毛主席语录，纵情歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。“五一”那天晚上，几个从山东来的红卫兵小将高兴地告诉我们：“解放军叔叔，我们今天看到了最最敬爱的毛主席，他老人家身体那样健康，真是全中国人民和全世界革命人民的最大幸福。”有一天，从山西来了几个盲人，他们一到天安门就问我们：“毛主席在什么地方走过呀？”我们就给他讲了“五一”节和去年国庆节晚上，毛主席他老人家和群众一起观看焰火的情景。他们听了后，高兴极了，就在毛主席坐过的地方摸啊！摸啊！他们流着泪说：“毛主席啊！我们的眼虽看不见您，可我们的这颗红心却永远向着您老人家！”四十一名从印尼归国的华侨青年，刚回来就来到天安门前，站在毛主席画像前，高声朗诵他们在同印尼反动派作斗争时集体创作的诗歌：“毛主席啊！您是我们心中的红太阳。当我们横遭敌人毒打时，想起了您，我们浑身是胆，意志如钢。即使敌人用刺刀剖开我们的胸腹吧！挖出来的，也只有一颗颗对毛主席对祖国无比忠诚的红心……。”
    全中国人民无限热爱毛主席，全世界革命人民也无限敬仰毛主席。我们经常看到许多外国朋友来到天安门前，面对着毛主席巨幅画像挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热烈欢呼，纵情歌唱。在庆祝我国氢弹爆炸的那天晚上，阿尔巴尼亚朋友和中国红卫兵一起，在天安门前金水桥边纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《万岁，毛主席》，用汉语高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”到深夜三点多钟还舍不得离开天安门。“五一”国际劳动节那天，来自各大洲的外国朋友们，见到了世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席。他们一对对幸福的眼睛看着毛主席，一双双热情的手伸向毛主席。一位来自越南南方的女青年，见到了敬爱的毛主席，激动得热泪滚滚，紧紧抱着毛主席，半天说不出话来。
    许多外国朋友和外地红卫兵在离开北京时，还来到天安门，在毛主席巨幅画像前摄影留念。有的包一点天安门下的土，装一瓶金水桥下的水，带回去作为最珍贵的纪念品。在天安门前，每天发生着多少热爱毛主席的动人事迹啊；又有多少人用各自认为最好的方式表达他们对毛主席的无限爱戴和思念啊！
    发生在天安门前的这些真实的故事，讲几天几夜也说不完。从这几件事里，我们深深体会到毛主席是全世界人民心中的红太阳。我们为世界进入了毛泽东思想的新时代而热烈欢呼！
