In the midst of the nationwide revolutionary criticism by the proletarian revolutionary masses against the party's top anti-Party clique, which is taking the capitalist road, the summary of the "Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Anti-Party Clique Led by Peng Dehuai" has been published. This is of great significance in thoroughly defeating the old-style counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and promoting the current revolutionary criticism mass movement.

This document is the product of the great victory achieved at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Lushan Conference, in 1959. The Lushan Conference exposed and smashed the plot of the anti-Party clique led by Peng Dehuai to usurp the Party, the army, and the government, and to restore capitalism. It defended the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, defended the Party's general line for building socialism, and defended the Party's and the people's socialist cause.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle that took place at Lushan is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two great antagonistic classes of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat during the past ten years of socialist revolution."

In the short period after the founding of the People's Republic, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. In 1958, Chairman Mao put forward the general line of building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and experimental spirit. This is the only correct Marxist-Leninist line summarized by Chairman Mao from the experience of building socialism at home and abroad. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line, the hundreds of millions of people in our country were full of enthusiasm and vigor, achieving great leaps forward in the national economy and the collectivization of the countryside.

The great victories of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement caused extreme panic and desperate resistance from all reactionary forces at home and abroad. At home, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and all kinds of ghosts and snakes came out of their holes, stirring up trouble. Internationally, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries went into a frenzy of anti-China hysteria, launching a frenzied attack on our Party and the Chinese people. It was at this time that the old right-opportunist Peng Dehuai, together with his accomplices Huang Kesheng, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Xiaozhou, hurriedly donned their armor and, in an organized, purposeful, and planned manner, launched a vicious attack on the Party, on socialism, and on our great leader Chairman Mao.

The so-called "Opinion" thrown out by the head of the anti-Party clique, Peng Dehuai, at the Lushan Conference, is a thorough and thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist program. He was ambitious and revealed his counter-revolutionary bones, fiercely opposing the high-speed development of the national economy, opposing the revolutionary mass movement in socialist construction, opposing the completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front, opposing the Party's leadership and political command, and opposing Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese and world revolutionary people.

At the Lushan Conference, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Peng Dehuai anti-Party clique was a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. It was a great struggle concerning the future and destiny of our great motherland.

Peng Dehuai's anti-Party activities at the Lushan Conference were not accidental or isolated incidents. They were the desperate and frenzied attacks of the dying bourgeoisie against the thriving socialist cause of the proletariat.

The number one person in the Party who is taking the capitalist road is the black backer of this counter-revolutionary attack.

It was he who, at the Lushan Conference, played the double-dealing trick of counter-revolution, actively supporting Peng Dehuai's anti-Party activities. After Peng Dehuai's plot was exposed, he continued to stir up trouble in secret, plotting to revise the originally prepared conference minutes into an anti-Mao Zedong proletarian revolutionary line "anti-left" document. After the Lushan Conference, he took to the field bare-chested, slandering the general line as having "blindness," the Great Leap Forward as a "sudden rise," causing "economic imbalance," the people's communes as being established "too early," and now facing a "crisis of disintegration." He ranted about how the "Lushan Conference made a mistake" and "the anti-rightist campaign was wrong." He also vigorously promoted the "Hai Rui spirit," stirred up a "reversal wind," and advocated for the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai and his ilk, attempting to let Peng Dehuai rise from the ashes, regain military power, and realize his counter-revolutionary plot to usurp the Party, the army, and the country.

All this fully shows that the struggle against the Peng Dehuai anti-Party clique is essentially a major battle in the long-term confrontation between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters.

Peng Dehuai's anti-Party activities were not only backed by China's Khrushchev but also supported by Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. After Peng Dehuai came out at the Lushan Conference, Khrushchev of the Soviet Union openly and shamelessly praised Peng Dehuai as "correct" and "brave," calling him his "best friend." The facts are clear: Peng Dehuai is a traitor who colluded with Khrushchev, the modern revisionist, to subvert our proletarian dictatorship.

The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "The long-standing anti-Party activities of the right-opportunist anti-Party clique led by Peng Dehuai are a serious danger to the Party's and the people's socialist cause."

Peng Dehuai has never been a Marxist but a thorough bourgeois warlord, a great schemer, and a great conspirator who infiltrated the Party and the army with the mentality of "investing." For decades, he has consistently taken a reactionary bourgeois stance, opposing Chairman Mao, opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For a long time, he used the position he had usurped in the Party Central Committee and the People's Liberation Army to carry out a series of plots to usurp the army, becoming the agent of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev within the military.

The Lushan Conference dug out this time bomb buried within the Party and the army. This is a serious blow to the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, a great victory for our Party and the people, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

However, the struggle between the two lines within our Party has not ended. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "In China, in our Party, this kind of struggle will probably continue for at least twenty years, possibly half a century, until the class is completely eliminated and the struggle will cease."

In the current revolutionary criticism, exposing the old-style counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai to the light of day and conducting a thorough and in-depth mass criticism and struggle is an important part of thoroughly criticizing the top anti-Party clique within the Party, which is taking the capitalist road and led by China's Khrushchev.

We must carry forward the spirit of thoroughly revolutionary struggle, thoroughly settling accounts with the top anti-Party clique within the Party, which is taking the capitalist road and includes Peng Dehuai, for their heinous crimes of being anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. We must thoroughly purge the poison of revisionism they have spread in various fields, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

### 彭德怀及其后台罪责难逃

    彭德怀及其后台罪责难逃
    在全国无产阶级革命派对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展革命大批判的高潮中，《中国共产党八届八中全会关于以彭德怀为首的反党集团的决议》（摘要），公开发表了。这对于彻底打倒老牌反革命修正主义分子彭德怀，对于彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，对于推动当前革命大批判的群众运动，有着十分重要的意义。
    这个文件，是一九五九年党的八届八中全会，即庐山会议取得伟大胜利的产物。庐山会议，揭露和粉碎了以彭德怀为首的反党集团篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，保卫了以毛主席为首的党中央的领导，保卫了党的建设社会主义的总路线，保卫了党和人民的社会主义事业。
    毛主席指出：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。”
    在建国以后的短时期内，我国人民在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。一九五八年，毛主席提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这是毛主席总结了国际国内建设社会主义的经验而提出的一条唯一正确的马克思列宁主义的路线。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国亿万人民斗志昂扬，意气风发，实现了国民经济大跃进和农村人民公社化。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动的伟大胜利，引起了国内外一切反动势力的极端恐慌和拚死反抗。在国内，地富反坏右和形形色色的牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，兴风作浪。在国际上，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反华歇斯底里大发作，向我们党和我国人民发动了疯狂的进攻。就在这个时候，老牌右倾机会主义分子彭德怀，纠集黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等同伙，慌忙披挂上阵，有组织、有目的、有计划地向党、向社会主义、向我们伟大的领袖毛主席进行了恶毒的攻击。
    反党集团头目彭德怀在庐山会议上抛出的所谓的《意见书》，是一个彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义纲领。他野心勃勃，反骨毕露，死命反对国民经济的高速度发展，反对社会主义建设中的革命群众运动，反对把经济战线上的社会主义革命进行到底，反对党的领导和政治挂帅，反对中国和世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    在庐山会议上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同彭德怀等反党集团的反革命修正主义路线之间的斗争，就是无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路的你死我活的斗争，是关系到我们伟大祖国的前途和命运的一场大搏斗。
    彭德怀在庐山会议上的反党活动，不是偶然的、孤立的事件。它是灭亡中的资产阶级向无产阶级欣欣向荣的社会主义事业所作的疯狂的绝望的进攻。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这次反革命进攻的黑后台。
    就是他，在庐山会议上大耍反革命两面手法，积极支持彭德怀的反党活动。当彭德怀的阴谋被揭穿以后，他仍然在暗地里煽风点火，阴谋把原来准备的会议纪要篡改为一个反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的反“左”文件。在庐山会议以后，他又赤膊上阵，污蔑总路线的提出有盲目性，大跃进是“一轰而起”，造成“经济失调”，“人民公社办早了”，“现在发生一种瓦解的危机”。他胡说什么“庐山会议犯了个错误”，“反右是不对的”。他还极力鼓吹“海瑞”精神，大刮“翻案风”，为以彭德怀为代表的右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，妄图让彭德怀死灰复燃，重掌军权，实现他篡党、篡军、篡国的反革命复辟阴谋。
    这一切，都充分说明，同彭德怀反党集团的斗争，实质上是无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部长期较量中的一次大战役。
    彭德怀的反党活动，不仅有中国的赫鲁晓夫作后台，而且有苏联的赫鲁晓夫撑腰打气。彭德怀在庐山会议上跳出来以后，苏联赫鲁晓夫就公然无耻地吹捧彭德怀是“正确的”、“勇敢的”，是他“最好的朋友”。事实十分清楚，彭德怀就是配合赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者，颠覆我国无产阶级专政的里通外国分子。
    党的八届八中全会决议指出：“以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义反党集团的由来已久的反党活动，是党和人民的社会主义事业的严重危险。”
    彭德怀从来就不是一个马克思主义者，而是一个带着“入股”的投机心理，混入党内、军内的地地道道的资产阶级大军阀，大野心家，大阴谋家。几十年来，他一贯坚持资产阶级反动立场，反对毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。长期以来，他利用自己在党中央和人民解放军中所窃取的地位，进行了一系列篡军的阴谋活动，成为以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部在军内的代理人。
    庐山会议挖掉了这颗埋在党内、军内的定时炸弹。这是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的严重打击，是我们党和人民的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    但是，我们党内两条路线的斗争并没有就此结束。正象毛主席所指出的：“在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，至少还要斗二十年，可能要斗半个世纪，总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息。”
    在当前革命的大批判中，把老牌反革命修正主义分子彭德怀揪到光天化日之下，进行群众性的深入的大批判、大斗争，这是彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一个重要组成部分。
    我们一定要发扬猛追穷寇、痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，彻底清算包括彭德怀在内的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，彻底肃清他们在各个领域所散布的修正主义流毒，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
