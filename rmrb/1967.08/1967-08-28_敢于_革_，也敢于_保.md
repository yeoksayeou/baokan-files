We proletarian revolutionaries must use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and use class analysis to correctly handle and distinguish between two types of cadres. Regarding the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we show no mercy, dare to revolutionize, and resolutely overthrow them. Regarding the people of the proletarian headquarters, we dare to protect, resolutely protect, and protect them all; at the same time, we conduct serious, comradely criticism and assistance for the shortcomings and errors they have made, so that they can be "liberated" as soon as possible.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Draw a clear line between two types. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it Yan'an or Xi'an?" When we look at a cadre, we must look at the whole picture, look at their major principles. If they have seven-tenths of their work correct, then we should basically affirm their work. To say that their mistakes are the main issue is completely wrong. Some cadres have performed well over a long period, but during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they executed the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressed the mass movement, or committed various errors. It is completely correct and necessary for revolutionary comrades to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line they executed and the errors they committed. However, some comrades only see the side where they made mistakes, and after criticizing, struggling against, and settling accounts with these cadres, they still won't let go. This is wrong. It should be clear that the one who proposed this bourgeois reactionary line is China's Khrushchev, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When they promoted this reactionary line, they used extremely covert and extremely vicious methods to deceive many cadres, making them, to varying degrees, executors of the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, these cadres themselves are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. So, this account should not be settled with these cadres, but should be settled with China's Khrushchev.

To dare to revolutionize and dare to protect, to correctly handle cadres who have made mistakes, this is a sharp struggle to criticize and repudiate private interests for the proletarian revolutionaries. Some people are afraid that if they touch the matter of liberating cadres, others will say they are "colluding" with those in power; say they have "rightist thoughts"; say they are "protecting so-and-so," and so on. But as revolutionaries, we should be open-hearted and have no private thoughts. We, for the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's line on cadres, thoroughly smash the part of the bourgeois reactionary line that "strikes down a large number and protects a small handful," stand up to protect the proletarian cadres in power, which is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

### 敢于“革”，也敢于“保”

    敢于“革”，也敢于“保”
    我们无产阶级革命派，必须以毛泽东思想为指针，用阶级分析的观点来正确对待和区分两种不同性质的干部。对待党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们毫不留情，敢于革，坚决革，坚决打倒。对待无产阶级司令部的人，我们敢于保，坚决保，统统保；同时，对他们所犯的缺点和错误，进行严肃的、同志式的批评、帮助，把他们尽早地“解放”出来。
    毛主席教导我们：“划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”我们在看待一个干部时，一定要全面的看，看他的大节。如果是七分成绩，那末就应该对他的工作基本上加以肯定。把成绩为主说成错误为主，那就完全错了。有的干部，长期来表现较好，但在文化大革命中，执行了资产阶级反动路线，压制了群众运动或犯有这样那样的错误，革命派同志对他所执行的资产阶级反动路线和所犯的错误进行揭发批判，这是完全正确、必要的。但是有的同志却只是看到他们犯错误的一面，对这些干部批了，斗了，清算了，仍然揪住不放。这是不对的。应该明了，提出这条资产阶级反动路线的，是中国的赫鲁晓夫，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，他们在推行这条反动路线时，用了极其隐蔽，极其阴险毒辣的手法，蒙蔽了不少干部，使他们程度不等地成了资产阶级反动路线的执行者。因此，这些干部本身也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。所以，这笔账不能算在这些干部身上，而应该算在中国的赫鲁晓夫的头上。
    做到既敢于革也敢于保，做到正确对待犯错误的干部，这对无产阶级革命派来说，是一场尖锐的破私立公的斗争。有的人怕一接触解放干部这件事，别人说他和当权派“勾勾搭搭”；说他有“右倾思想”；说他是“保某派”，等等。但是，作为一个革命者，应该胸怀坦白，不存私念。我们为了正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部路线，彻底砸烂“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线组成部分，起来保护无产阶级当权派，是符合毛泽东思想的。
