The Indian ruling clique, under instructions from the US and the Soviet Union, is again attempting a military adventure against us. The Chinese people are ready at any time to smash the provocations of the Indian reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Our reporter reports that in recent days, the Indian reactionaries have repeatedly made frenzied anti-China outcries, threatening to use military force against China, to "recover lost territories," and so on. This is the Indian reactionaries preparing public opinion for their military adventure against China. The 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese border defense troops, who have already defeated the Indian invading army, are closely watching the movements of this running dog of US imperialism and Soviet revisionism and are ready to give it the punishment it deserves. The Indian reactionaries should not miscalculate!

In recent times, the Indian invaders have become increasingly brazen in their incursions into the Chinese border. From July 12th to 17th, Indian military aircraft invaded Chinese airspace in Xinjiang and Tibet a total of 16 times. On July 29th, at the Zola Pass on the China-Sikkim border, the Indian invading army actually opened fire on our troops; on August 1st, three Indian invaders crossed the border and brazenly provoked our border defense troops. From August 1st to 4th, the Indian invading army repeatedly invaded the Daji Pass on this border, with 30 or more Indian soldiers on horseback invading our territory in two batches on August 4th, reaching a depth of more than 2,000 meters. In the eastern section of the China-India border, the Indian invading army continued to invade Chinese territory in the so-called "McMahon Line" area of the Bangshan Pass in late July.

While taking these military aggression actions, the Indian reactionaries are shouting in the parliament. Some members of parliament shout to "recover the thousands of square miles of land lost to China and Pakistan"; to have the Indian government sign a "joint defense treaty" with the Soviet revisionists to deal with China; to have the government form an anti-China military alliance with other neighboring countries of China; and so on. They also spread vicious rumors that China has "established military bases" around Kashmir. Indian reactionary government Defense Minister Swaran Singh incited in the parliament on the 9th that the Indian government would "fully and effectively" deal with the "attacks" from China, Pakistan, or their combined forces.

Recently, the Indian reactionary government also specially invited a Reuters reporter to the vicinity of the western section of the China-India border in Le City to observe the Indian invading army on the China-India border. This British reporter exaggerated the morale and equipment of the Indian invading army, which is not worth a fight, to match the Indian government's anti-China outcries.

The Indian reactionaries suddenly brought up the China-India border issue to make a big fuss about it, obviously to create tension on the China-India border and prepare for new military adventures. What is particularly despicable is that they use the trick of "turning the tables." They clearly occupied 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory in the eastern section of the China-India border, but they say that China has "occupied" Indian territory; they clearly intend to launch a military adventure, but they say that China might launch a "new military adventure" against India; thus covering up their plot.

On August 7th, the *Indian Express* published a vicious anti-China article saying that in several capital cities around the world, including Belgrade and Tokyo, people are increasingly worried that China might "launch a new military adventure" in the summer. The Indian reactionary government's mouthpiece, the Indian News Agency, immediately forwarded this extremely absurd article on the same day.

While making these anti-China outcries, the Indian reactionaries also viciously attacked and threatened Pakistan, threatening to "recover" the so-called "lost territories" from Pakistan.

The Indian reactionaries' anti-China and anti-Pakistan outburst, of course, is under the instructions and support of their two masters, US imperialism and Soviet revisionism. US imperialism and Soviet revisionism recently gave this running dog a large sum of military funds and tanks, aircraft, missiles, submarines, and other weapons of aggression. The Indian reactionaries became arrogant and misjudged the situation, mistakenly thinking they could make a grab from China and Pakistan and divert the attention of the Indian people who are rising up in rebellion.

If the Indian reactionaries forget the lesson of invading China in 1962, then come again. If you dare to launch a new military adventure, the result will only be that you will lift a stone to drop it on your own feet. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The enemy always underestimates the initiative of our army and overestimates their own strength, although they are also timid at the same time."

    印度统治集团在美苏指使下又妄图对我进行军事冒险
    中国人民随时准备粉碎印度反动派挑衅
    新华社十一日讯　本社记者报道：最近几天，印度反动派接连发出疯狂的反华叫嚣，扬言要用军事力量对付中国，“收复失地”等等。这是印度反动派在为它向中国进行军事冒险作舆论准备。七亿中国人民和曾经把印度侵略军打得落花流水的中国边防部队，正在密切注视着美帝、苏修的这条走狗的动向，并且随时准备给予应得的惩罚。印度反动派休要打错算盘！
    最近一段时期，印度侵略者入侵中国边境的活动越来越猖狂。从七月十二日到十七日的一周内，印度军用飞机侵入中国新疆和西藏领空达十六架次之多。七月二十九日，在中国—锡金边界上的卓拉山口，印度侵略军竟然开枪向我军射击；八月一日，三名印度侵略军越过边界，悍然向中国边防部队进行挑衅。八月一日至四日，印度侵略军在这条边界上的达吉山口连续入侵，其中八月四日，印军三十多人乘马分两批侵入我国国境达两千多米。在中印边界东段，印度侵略军七月下旬在所谓“麦克马洪线”上的棒山口继续侵入中国领土。
    在采取这些军事侵略行动的同时，印度反动派在议会里大叫大喊。一些议员叫嚷要“收复丢给中国和巴基斯坦的几千平方英里的土地”；要印度政府同苏修“缔结共同防御条约”，对付中国；要政府同中国的其它邻国结成反华军事同盟；等等。他们还大肆造谣说，中国在克什米尔周围“建立了军事基地圈”。印度反动政府的国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格，九日在议会煽动说什么印度政府将“全力和有效地”对付中国的、巴基斯坦的或者它们联合的“进攻”。
    最近，印度反动政府还特地把一名路透社记者请到中印边界西段附近的列城，让他参观了中印边境上的印度侵略军。这个英国记者把不堪一击的印度侵略军的士气、装备肉麻地吹嘘一番，来配合印度政府的反华叫嚣。
    印度反动派在这时候忽然又拿出中印边界问题来大肆反华，显然是为了配合它在中印边境制造紧张局势和准备发动新的军事冒险行动。尤其卑鄙的是，它采取“倒打一耙”的伎俩。明明是印度反动派在中印边界东段强占了中国九万平方公里的领土，它反倒说中国“占领”了印度领土；明明是印度反动派企图搞军事冒险，它反倒说中国可能对印度进行“新的军事冒险”；这样来掩盖它的阴谋活动。
    八月七日，《印度时报》刊载了一篇恶毒反华的文章，说什么在包括贝尔格莱德和东京在内的世界好几个国家的首都，人们愈来愈担心中国可能在夏季某个时候“从事新的军事冒险”。印度反动政府的喉舌印度新闻处当天立即转发了这篇十分荒诞的东西。
    印度反动派在发出这些反华叫嚣的同时，还大肆攻击和威胁巴基斯坦，扬言也要从巴基斯坦那里“收复”所谓“失地”。
    印度反动派这种反华反巴的大发作，当然是得到它的两个主子美帝和苏修的指使和支持的。美帝和苏修最近给了它们的这条走狗一大笔军费和坦克、飞机、导弹、潜艇等侵略武器。印度反动派就得意忘形，错误地估计形势，妄图向中国和巴基斯坦捞一把，转移印度国内纷纷起来造反的人民的视线。
    印度反动派如果忘记了一九六二年侵略中国的教训，那你们就再来吧。你们胆敢进行新的军事冒险，其结局只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“敌人对于我军的积极性总是估计不足的，对于自己力量总是估计过高，虽然他们同时又是惊弓之鸟。”
