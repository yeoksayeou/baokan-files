The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka has expressed the strongest protest against the Sri Lankan government's blatant following of the American Empire in creating "Two Chinas." The Chinese people resolutely strike back against the Sri Lankan government's anti-China provocations.

New China News Agency, Colombo, August 23rd - On the 22nd, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka sent a note to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs, expressing great indignation over the Sri Lankan government's blatant following of the American Empire in creating "Two Chinas," continually colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and deliberately sabotaging normal Sino-Sri Lankan relations. The Chinese Embassy, on instructions, has lodged the strongest protest with the Sri Lankan government. The note sternly pointed out that the Sri Lankan government must immediately sever all ties with the Chiang bandits, stop any Chiang bandit elements from operating in Sri Lanka, and ensure that it does not participate in any activities aimed at creating "Two Chinas."

The note pointed out that the Sri Lankan Girl Guides Association invited the Taiwan Chiang bandits to participate in the "Asian Girl Guides Training Conference" held in Colombo on August 12th; and also invited the Chiang bandits to participate in the "Third Asian Boxing Championship" to be held in December. This training conference and boxing match were initiated or organized by Sri Lanka, and were hosted and funded by the Sri Lankan government.

The note said that on August 11th, the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, Xi Ye Sheng, had already lodged a protest with the Sri Lankan government, expressing the Chinese government's firm opposition to Sri Lanka's collusion with the Chiang bandits and collaboration with the American Empire in creating "Two Chinas," and demanding that the Sri Lankan government take immediate measures to stop the Chiang bandit elements from participating in the "Asian Girl Guides Training Conference" in Sri Lanka, and ensure that the Chiang bandit elements do not participate in the boxing match. When the Chiang bandit elements came to Sri Lanka to participate in the training conference, the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires again lodged a serious protest with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on August 15th, demanding that the Sri Lankan government immediately expel the Chiang bandit elements from the country. The Sri Lankan government, ignoring the Chinese Embassy's serious protests and demands, not only did not ensure that the Chiang bandit elements would not come to Sri Lanka to participate in the boxing match, but also openly allowed the Chiang bandit elements to continue their activities in Sri Lanka.

The note emphasized that this is a serious incident of hostility towards the Chinese people, a gross interference in China's internal affairs, and a serious step to sabotage normal Sino-Sri Lankan relations. The Chinese people express great indignation over this.

The note sternly pointed out that since the current Sri Lankan government, led by the United National Party, came to power, it has blatantly followed the American Empire in creating "Two Chinas," condoned the Chiang bandit elements' anti-China activities, and played a counter-revolutionary two-faced game. The Sri Lankan government claims to recognize only one China, the People's Republic of China, but when Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dudley visited the United States in 1966, he clearly stated to the press that the Sri Lankan government had not yet decided how the United Nations should handle the Taiwan issue; the Sri Lankan official radio, government news releases, publications, tender notices, and official newsreels have repeatedly and openly referred to the Chinese territory of Taiwan as a "state." Moreover, Sri Lanka maintains various contacts with the Chiang bandits. Since 1966, exchanges between Sri Lanka and the Chiang bandits have become more frequent. For example, the Sri Lankan government allowed Chiang bandit elements to participate in the International Lawyers Committee meeting and the World Buddhist Conference in Sri Lanka, allowed high-level officials from the Chiang bandits' "Foreign Ministry" to operate in Sri Lanka, allowed a five-person delegation from the Chiang bandits to survey the tea industry in Sri Lanka and sent three so-called rice experts, invited Chiang bandit elements to participate in the tennis championship held in Sri Lanka, sent representatives to Taiwan to participate in the Asian Chamber of Commerce meeting, sent government officials to Taiwan to participate in the so-called "Impact of Atomic Radiation on Rice Seeds" conference, and recently sent six people to Taiwan to learn the so-called scientific methods of rice sowing, etc. All these activities, either conducted with the agreement and support of the Sri Lankan government, or directly initiated by the Sri Lankan government, attempt to use "non-governmental organizations," "non-governmental invitations," "participation in international conferences," etc., to make excuses, shift responsibility, and evade the serious condemnation of the Chinese people and the people of the world, which is in vain.

The note pointed out that the current Sri Lankan government has consistently collaborated with American imperialism in creating "Two Chinas" and continually colluded with the Chiang bandits who occupy Chinese territory in Taiwan. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The Chiang Kai-shek clique is a political corpse long since spat out by the Chinese people, a running dog of American imperialism. American imperialism and its lackeys are trying in every way to create "Two Chinas," which is an important part of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries' anti-China activities, and is their counter-revolutionary attempt to reverse the wheel of history. The Sri Lankan government's active participation in this criminal activity exposes your willingness to follow the American Empire and collude with the Chiang bandits to engage in anti-China activities, playing the role of an anti-China clown for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Whoever opposes China will face the resolute counterattack of the Chinese people and the resolute opposition of their own people. The current Sri Lankan government, led by the United National Party, will be no exception.

The note finally pointed out that if the Sri Lankan government persists in its error and continues to act in this manner, then all the serious consequences that arise from this must be borne entirely by the Sri Lankan side.

    我使馆最强烈抗议锡兰政府追随美帝制造“两个中国”
    中国人民坚决回击锡兰政府的反华挑衅
    新华社科伦坡二十三日电　中国驻锡兰大使馆二十二日照会锡兰国防、外交部，对锡兰政府十分露骨地追随美帝制造“两个中国”，不断同蒋匪帮勾勾搭搭，蓄意破坏中锡正常关系的严重步骤表示极大的愤慨。中国大使馆奉命向锡兰政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会严正指出，锡兰政府必须立即断绝与蒋帮的一切联系，制止任何蒋帮分子到锡兰活动，保证不参与任何制造“两个中国”的罪恶勾当。
    照会指出，锡兰女童子军协会邀请台湾蒋帮参加八月十二日在科伦坡举行的“亚洲女童子军教练会议”；还邀请蒋帮参加将在十二月举行的“第三届亚洲拳击锦标赛”。这次教练会议和拳击赛是锡兰发起或组织的，由锡兰官方主持和资助的。
    照会说，中国大使馆临时代办奚业胜八月十一日就此向锡兰政府提出交涉，表明了中国政府坚决反对锡兰与蒋帮勾结，配合美帝制造“两个中国”的立场，要求锡兰政府立即采取措施，制止蒋帮分子到锡兰参加“亚洲女童子军教练会议”，保证不许蒋帮分子到锡兰参加拳击赛。当蒋帮分子来锡兰参加教练会议后，中国大使馆临时代办又于八月十五日向锡兰国防、外交部提出严重抗议，要求锡兰政府立即驱逐蒋帮分子出境。锡兰政府无视中国大使馆的严正交涉、抗议和要求，不但没有保证不许蒋帮分子来锡参加拳击赛，而且公然允许蒋帮分子继续在锡兰活动。
    照会强调说，这是敌视中国人民的严重事件，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是蓄意破坏中锡正常关系的严重步骤。中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨。
    照会严正指出，以统一国民党为首的锡兰现政府上台以来，一直十分露骨地追随美帝制造“两个中国”、纵容蒋帮分子进行敌视中国人民的反华勾当，并且玩弄反革命两面手法。锡兰政府声称只承认一个中国，即中华人民共和国，但锡兰总理杜德利一九六六年访美时却对记者明白表示，锡兰政府要联合国如何处理台湾问题尚未作出决定；锡兰官方电台、政府新闻公报、出版物、招标单和官方摄制的新闻片竟一再公然把中国领土台湾称为“国家”。而且锡兰与蒋帮保持多方面的联系。一九六六年以来，锡兰与蒋帮之间来往更为频繁。例如，锡兰政府允许蒋帮分子来锡参加国际法学家委员会会议和世界佛教僧侣会议，允许蒋帮“外交部”高级官员来锡活动，允许蒋帮五人小组来锡考察茶叶工业和派三名所谓水稻专家来锡，邀请蒋帮分子参加在锡兰举行的网球锦标赛。锡兰派代表去台湾参加亚洲商会联合会会议，派政府官员去台湾参加所谓“原子放射对稻种影响”会议，最近又派了六名人员去台湾学习所谓播种稻种的科学方法等等。所有这些活动，要么是在锡兰政府同意和支持下进行的，要么是锡兰政府直接出面干的，企图以“非官方组织”、“非官方邀请”、“参加国际会议”等为由，进行狡辩，推卸责任，逃脱中国人民和世界人民的严正谴责，是枉费心机的。
    照会指出，锡兰现政府一贯配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”，不断同盘踞在中国领土台湾的蒋介石匪帮勾勾搭搭。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。蒋介石集团是早就被中国人民所唾弃的政治僵尸，是美帝豢养的走狗，美帝及其帮凶千方百计地妄图制造“两个中国”，这是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反华的一个重要组成部分，是它们妄图扭转历史车轮的反革命行为。锡兰政府积极参与这一罪恶活动，暴露了你们甘愿追随美帝与蒋帮分子密切勾结进行反华的真实面目，充当了帝修反的反华小丑。谁要反华，谁就将遭到中国人民的坚决回击，也将遭到本国人民的坚决反对。对以统一国民党为首的锡兰现政府，也决不会例外。
    照会最后指出，如果锡兰政府执迷不悟，坚持错误，那末，由此产生的一切严重后果，必须由锡兰方面承担全部责任。
