	The Biggest "Parliamentary Fanatic"
	Soldiers of a certain unit of the PLA, Wang Chuanbin and Liu Fu

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This is an unshakable truth. The revolution in our country was led by Chairman Mao and, relying on armed struggle, achieved great victories.

	However, the biggest power-holder in the Party who is taking the capitalist road has been parroting the rhetoric of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, preaching "peaceful coexistence" in Indonesia, vigorously advocating "class cooperation," and singing praises of "parliamentary struggle" and the "peaceful road." In the reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia," he fawningly praises the Indonesian bourgeoisie's Nasakom policy, claiming that he is "happy to see that the Indonesian national unity advocated by President Sukarno with Nasakom as its core is becoming increasingly solidified." He says things like "leftists holding a few ministerial positions in the government can accumulate some experience in managing the state," and so on. In Indonesia, he does not promote Mao Zedong Thought or discuss the rich experience of our people in seizing political power through armed struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Instead, he spends his days mingling with the bourgeoisie in Indonesia, fervently promoting his line of "three surrenders and one annihilation," peddling counter-revolutionary goods like the "parliamentary road" and "class cooperation." This completely exposes his revisionist face of opposing proletarian revolution.

	As early as 1939, Chairman Mao pointed out: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." The practice of the Chinese revolution has proven this, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are proving this. What "peaceful transition," "parliamentary struggle," "class cooperation," are all soft knives to strangle the people's revolution! Not long ago, the Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party criticized the revisionist line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, pointing out that this counter-revolutionary line caused serious damage to the Indonesian Communist Party and brought enormous losses to the Indonesian people's revolutionary movement. The blood lesson of tens of thousands of people losing their heads in Indonesia once again proves that the revisionist road of "peaceful transition" advocated by the CPSU leadership is a road to bury the revolution, a road to the destruction of the Party and the loss of heads.

	However, the biggest power-holder in the Party who is taking the capitalist road is obsessed with this "peaceful road." He is a die-hard "parliamentary fanatic." As early as when he was working in the Anyuan Coal Mine, he betrayed the fundamental interests of the working class, advocating that workers should "mutually assist" and "seek happiness together" with capitalists, resulting in countless Communist Party members and workers being massacred, bringing incalculable losses to the workers' movement. In 1945, amidst the national crisis of impending civil war and the clamor of Chiang Kai-shek sharpening his knife, he fantasized about peace and advocated the "parliamentary road," claiming that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has already become peaceful and parliamentary, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle." He wanted the Party to hand over the army to the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek, give up military power to "become officials," and "rely on elections," and so on. He even said this was a "profitable" deal, aiming to make us give up armed struggle, not seize political power, and not have a proletarian revolution. This is thorough and complete class surrenderism. We must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, and throw all the junk of China's Khrushchev into the garbage heap of history!

    最大的“议会迷”
    解放军某部战士　王传斌　刘富
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。我国革命就是在毛主席的英明领导下，依靠了武装斗争，才取得了伟大的胜利。
    可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却学着赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的腔调，在印尼大念“和平经”，竭力鼓吹“阶级合作”，为“议会斗争”、“和平道路”高唱颂歌。在反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》中，他肉麻地吹捧印尼资产阶级的纳沙贡政策，胡说什么“高兴地看到苏加诺总统倡导的以纳沙贡为核心的印尼民族团结正在日益巩固。”什么“左派在政府里当几个部长，可以积累一些管理国家的经验”等等。他在印尼不宣传毛泽东思想，不谈我国人民在毛主席的英明领导下进行武装夺取政权的丰富经验，却整天和印尼的资产阶级头面人物鬼混在一起，狂热地宣扬他的“三降一灭”的投降主义路线，贩卖“议会道路”、“阶级合作”等反革命黑货。这完全暴露了他反对无产阶级革命的修正主义嘴脸。
    毛主席早在一九三九年就指出：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”中国革命斗争的实践证明了这一点，亚非拉人民的革命斗争实践正在证明这一点。什么“和平过渡”、“议会斗争”、“阶级合作”，统统是扼杀人民革命的软刀子！不久以前，印尼共产党政治局批判了苏共二十大的修正主义路线，指出这条反革命路线给印尼共产党造成了严重的破坏，给印尼人民革命运动带来了巨大的损失。印尼成千上万人头落地这个血的教训，再次证明了苏共领导集团所鼓吹的“和平过渡”的修正主义道路，是埋葬革命的道路，是亡党亡头的道路。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却热中于这种“和平道路”，他是一个地地道道的“议会迷”。早在安源煤矿工作时，他就出卖工人阶级的根本利益，要工人同资本家“互相帮助”、“共谋幸福”，结果使无数的共产党员和工人惨遭屠杀，给工人运动带来了不可估量的损失。一九四五年，他又在蒋介石磨刀霍霍声中，在内战危机笼罩全国的情况下，幻想和平，鼓吹“议会道路”，胡说什么“中国革命主要斗争形势已经变为和平的，议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争。”他要党把军队交给国民党蒋介石，放弃兵权“去做官”，“靠投票选举”等等。他居然说这是“划得来”的“赚钱”的买卖，其目的就是要我们放弃武装斗争，不要夺取政权，不要无产阶级革命，这是彻头彻尾的阶级投降主义。我们必须高举革命的批判大旗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫的那套破烂货统统扔到历史的垃圾堆里去！
