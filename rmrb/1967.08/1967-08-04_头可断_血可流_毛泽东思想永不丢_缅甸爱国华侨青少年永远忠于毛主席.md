Thousands of patriotic overseas Chinese youth in a certain place in Burma love our great motherland and have limitless faith and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the overseas Chinese youth here have carried out a moving struggle against the anti-China plots of the Burmese reactionaries.

In 1965, the Ne Win reactionary government arbitrarily seized local Chinese schools and declared them "nationalized." Patriotic overseas Chinese youth, in order to continue studying the culture of their motherland, braved numerous difficulties and established Chinese language supplementary classes. Originally, it was a sacred and inviolable right for overseas Chinese students to learn the language and script of their motherland and to receive cultural education from their motherland. However, the Burmese reactionary authorities were terrified and imposed numerous obstacles and restrictions. On May 12 of this year, they arbitrarily ordered the closure of the Chinese language supplementary classes.

Why did the Burmese reactionary authorities order the closure of the Chinese language supplementary classes? The words of a reactionary county magistrate in the area answered this question. He bluntly told the overseas Chinese, "You are setting up Chinese language supplementary classes to teach the books of Mao Zedong. I, standing on the government's position, firmly oppose this." This clearly exposed the reactionary stance of the Burmese reactionary government in its hostility towards socialist China.

The Burmese reactionary authorities' forcible closure of the Chinese language supplementary classes was not an isolated incident. It was a signal for the Ne Win reactionary government's large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign. Overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought resolutely fought back against the persecution by the Burmese reactionary authorities. They paid no heed to the reactionary authorities' orders; you order your closure, we continue our classes. They continued to run the supplementary classes.

Unable to stop the operation of the Chinese language supplementary classes, the Burmese reactionary authorities resorted to even more vicious means. In early June, the Burmese reactionary authorities announced that students were not allowed to wear Mao Zedong badges. This incident aroused the great indignation of the patriotic overseas Chinese youth. They angrily declared, "Chinese people wearing badges of their great leader Chairman Mao is a sacred and inviolable right, a matter of course. Whoever opposes us wearing Mao Zedong badges, we will fight to the end with them."

The overseas Chinese youth ignored the reactionary authorities' "warnings" and continued to wear Mao Zedong badges to school. The reactionary authorities, in a state of panic, mobilized a large number of armed military police to surround the Chinese language supplementary classes layer by layer. The reactionary military police, armed to the teeth, bayonets fixed, were on high alert. A captain, under the "protection" of fully armed military police, came to the school and forced the principal to summon the students for a "lecture." The students were all filled with righteous indignation and faced the reactionary officer with cold stares. In the face of the reactionary officer's hysterical screams, the students, wearing their shining Mao Zedong badges, stood tall and unyielding. A student around ten years old bravely resisted a armed military police who tried to forcibly remove his Mao Zedong badge from his chest, firmly pushing the military police back.

The enemy's high-pressure and threatening tactics did not intimidate the young fighters. The reactionary officer, in a fit of rage, shouted, "All of you are expelled!" The brave young fighters roared back in protest. When the reactionary officer handed a notice reading "Violated school rules, expelled" to the ten-year-old female student, she, in a fit of rage, tore the notice to shreds and threw it on the ground. Her revolutionary action greatly boosted the fighting spirit of her fellow students. At this moment, the reactionary officer, trembling with rage, his face pale, screamed, "Guards! Beat them!" A armed military police raised his rifle butt to strike the girl, but she remained calm and unflinching, standing tall and shouting, "Come on, if you have the guts!"

Under the threat of the reactionary military police's tyranny, 70 young people were expelled from the supplementary classes for wearing Mao Zedong badges. But what is expulsion? Expulsion cannot shake their loyalty to Chairman Mao. They continued to wear their shining Mao Zedong badges and organized themselves outside the school to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Together with the patriotic overseas Chinese, they launched a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works. They declared, "Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but we will never abandon Mao Zedong Thought."

Their revolutionary actions received the firm support of the patriotic overseas Chinese. As one parent said, "For the sake of defending Mao Zedong Thought, even if my son is imprisoned, I will feel proud and honored. I believe these patriotic youth will definitely 'make up their minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.'"

    头可断　血可流　毛泽东思想永不丢
    缅甸爱国华侨青少年永远忠于毛主席
    缅甸某地数千名爱国华侨和青少年，热爱我们伟大的祖国，无限信仰和崇拜我们的伟大领袖毛主席。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，这里的华侨青少年，与缅甸反动派的反华阴谋进行了可歌可泣的斗争。
    一九六五年，奈温反动政府无理地把当地的华侨学校“收归国有”。爱国华侨青少年为了继续学习祖国的文化，冲破重重困难，开办了华文补习班。本来，华侨子弟学习自己祖国的语言文字，接受祖国的文化教育，是神圣不可侵犯的正当权利。缅甸反动当局却怕得要死，多方刁难和限制。今年五月十二日竟又无理地勒令华文补习班停办。
    缅甸反动当局为什么要勒令停办华文补习班？当地一个反动的县长所说的话回答了这个问题。他露骨地对华侨说：“你们办华文补习班要教毛泽东的书，我站在政府的立场上，坚决反对。”这就很清楚地暴露了缅甸反动政府敌视社会主义中国的反动立场。
    缅甸反动当局强行勒令停办华文补习班，绝不是孤立的事件。这是奈温反动政府大规模反华排华的信号弹。用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国华侨，对缅甸反动当局的迫害进行了坚决的斗争。他们不管反动当局那一套，你勒令你的，我办我的，他们把补习班继续办了下去。
    缅甸反动当局无法阻止华文补习班的开办，于是采取了更为恶毒的手段。六月初，缅甸反动当局竟然宣布学生不准佩带毛主席像章。这件事激起了爱国华侨青少年的极大愤慨。他们愤怒地表示：“中国人佩带自己伟大领袖毛主席的像章，是神圣不可侵犯的权利，是天经地义的事。谁反对我们佩带毛主席像章，我们就和他拚到底。”
    华侨青少年藐视反动当局的“警告”，照样佩带毛主席像章上学。反动当局惊慌失措，悍然调动大批武装军警，层层包围了华文补习班。反动军警荷枪实弹，刺刀上梢，如临大敌。一个上尉军官在全副武装军警的保“驾”下，来到学校，逼着校长召集学生“训话”。同学们个个义愤填膺，横眉冷对。在反动军官歇斯底里地狂叫面前，佩带着金光闪闪的毛主席像章的同学，大义凛然，岿然不动。一位十来岁的同学向一个前来企图强行摘下他胸前的毛主席像章的武装军警进行了英勇的斗争，坚决把这个军警顶了回去。
    敌人的高压和威胁手段吓不倒小将。反动军官暴跳如雷地嘶叫：“统统开除。”英勇的小将们对横蛮无理的反动军官发出雷霆般的抗议声。当反动军官把一张写着“触犯校规，开除学籍”的“开除信”递给这位十来岁的女同学时，她怒不可遏地当场把“开除信”撕得粉碎，扔到地上。她的这个革命行动大大鼓舞了同学们的战斗意志。这时，反动军官气得浑身发抖，脸色发青，狂叫道：“来人呀！给我打！”一个武装军警举起枪托要打这个女孩子，她脸不变色，心不跳，挺起胸膛，高声叫道：“来吧，有胆量的就来吧！”……
    在反动军警淫威逼迫下，有七十名青少年因佩带毛主席像章而被开除出补习班。但是，开除算得了什么！开除动摇不了忠于毛主席的红心。他们仍然佩带着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，在校外组织起来，学习和宣传毛泽东思想。他们同爱国华侨一起，掀起了一个学习毛主席著作的新高潮。他们表示：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想永不丢。”
    他们的革命行动，得到了爱国侨胞的坚决支持。正如一位家长所说的：“为了捍卫毛泽东思想，我儿子就是坐了牢，我也感到骄傲，感到光荣。我相信这些爱国青少年一定会‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”　（新华社讯）
