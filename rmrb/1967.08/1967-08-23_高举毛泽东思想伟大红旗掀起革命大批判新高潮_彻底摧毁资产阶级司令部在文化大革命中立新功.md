The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a revolutionary criticism on-site meeting at Beijing Normal University, issuing a call to higher education institutions to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

Vice Premier Xie Fuqi called on everyone to recognize the excellent situation, seriously study the works of Chairman Mao, not to go out for linking up, not to engage in "internal wars," but to unite and carry out planned revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," thoroughly smash the revisionist educational system, and establish a new educational system based on Mao Zedong Thought.

New China News Agency, August 22nd: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a revolutionary criticism on-site meeting at Beijing Normal University today, with Beijing Normal University introducing its experiences in revolutionary criticism. The meeting called on the revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of higher education institutions in the capital to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, summarize and exchange experiences, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

The meeting emphasized that the current stage of the Cultural Revolution is the decisive battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and the situation is excellent and getting better. The revolutionary masses must recognize the situation, firmly grasp the direction of exposing, criticizing, and struggling against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and advance resolutely along the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, thoroughly defeating them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. The meeting required the revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of higher education institutions in the capital to correctly understand the relationship between the current revolutionary criticism and supporting the left, not to go out for linking up, but to sit down, seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, concentrate on carrying out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, which is the greatest support for the revolutionary masses nationwide.

Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Xie Fuqi, and members of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Zhou Jingfang and Ding Guoyi attended today's on-site meeting.

Comrade Xie Fuqi, in his speech at the meeting, emphasized the great significance of revolutionary criticism. He said, revolutionary criticism is to politically, ideologically, and theoretically expose and condemn the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and completely eliminate the revisionist poison they have spread in various fields. This requires us to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and launch a high tide of study. Now is not the time to go out and stir up trouble, but to sit down, think, and carry out revolutionary criticism. In the process of revolutionary criticism, we should achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination"; on the basis of smashing the revisionist educational line, we should establish a new educational system based on Mao Zedong Thought. We in the capital's higher education institutions should stop "internal wars," unite, and carry out planned revolutionary criticism. We should carry out revolutionary criticism well, and on this basis, initially establish a new educational system, which is the greatest support for the revolutionary masses nationwide.

Comrade Xie Fuqi said, holding such a meeting to exchange experiences in revolutionary criticism is very good. After returning, everyone should summarize and create experiences, and carry out revolutionary criticism even better.

The responsible comrade of the Beijing Normal University Revolutionary Committee introduced the school's experiences in carrying out revolutionary criticism at the meeting. The Political Education Department, the Chinese Language Department's graduating class combat team, and the Foreign Languages Department also made typical speeches respectively. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can only be waged by mobilizing the masses and can only be waged by relying on the masses." They introduced their experiences, saying that to carry out revolutionary criticism well, we must mobilize the masses. In the process of mobilizing the masses, we must repeatedly carry out education on the significance of revolutionary criticism, situation education, and class education according to the development of the movement. Our method of carrying out education on the significance of revolutionary criticism is: using various forms such as large and small meetings and discussions to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, the May 16th Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and relevant editorials in the Red Flag magazine and People's Daily, so that the broad revolutionary teachers and students can understand: the current revolutionary criticism is a battle to defend the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The attitude towards revolutionary criticism is the attitude towards the Cultural Revolution, the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, and the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Revolutionary criticism is the great historical mission of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and is a new test of "revolution" and "preservation" in the new situation. In this way, the broad revolutionary teachers and students quickly raised their understanding of the great significance of revolutionary criticism. At the same time, we also focused on class education and carried out the "two remembrances and three examinations" activities, through remembering the bitterness of class oppression in the old society and the bitterness of persecution by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, thinking about the sweetness of the new society and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, further deepening the broad revolutionary teachers and students' hatred for China's Khrushchev, strengthening their boundless love for Chairman Mao, raising their class consciousness and line struggle consciousness, and thus enthusiastically investing in the new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

They said that situation education is very important because if the situation is misunderstood, it is impossible to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the direction will be wrong. The class enemy is most afraid of revolutionary criticism, so they use various means to interfere with the direction of the struggle. This class struggle is also reflected within the revolutionary ranks, and some teachers and students cannot calm down to carry out revolutionary criticism but are eager to go out for linking up, supporting the revolutionary masses in other places. The school revolutionary committee, according to the thoughts of the masses, timely explained the situation, reported the situation of the Cultural Revolution in various places across the country, held situation analysis meetings, and organized learning and discussions. Through regular situation education, the broad teachers and students clearly understood: phenomena such as the enemy instigating armed struggles, creating chaos, and counterattacking the revolutionary masses do not indicate the strength of the enemy but are manifestations of their desperate struggles. We must concentrate our hatred on the pen tip and direct the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Regular situation education enables the broad revolutionary teachers and students to recognize the situation in time, not be interfered with, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and the broad revolutionary teachers and students proposed the suggestions of "three insistences and three oppositions" in the discussion, that is, insisting on the direction of the great struggle, criticism, and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, opposing "internal wars"; insisting on the great unity and great alliance of the revolution, opposing splits; insisting on the great debate of big wall newspapers, big character posters, big speeches, and big arguments, opposing armed struggles. In this way, the revolutionary criticism was carried out step by step.

They introduced that according to different situations and different objects, in-depth and detailed political and ideological work was carried out. After the establishment of the school revolutionary committee, we carried out education on "not eating old capital, but establishing new merits" against the arrogance and complacency that had grown among the teachers and students. We focused on the ideological work of the Red Guards, inspiring and educating the Red Guards to play a vanguard role in the criticism; educating the graduates to stand the last watch with the actual actions of carrying out the criticism well; educating the teachers to discard the fear and establish the courage, go to the students, and together invest in the criticism. Through a series of detailed ideological work, the number of complacent people was greatly reduced, and the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers and students for criticism quickly rose. When the simple military view of "writing big character posters is everything," only paying attention to quantity and not quality, only carrying out criticism and not caring about the ideological transformation of people appeared, we organized the teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," guiding the teachers and students to consciously overcome this idea through lectures, rectification meetings, and heart-to-heart talks, combining criticism with ideological transformation. Some classes also created the experience of studying (studying Chairman Mao's works) while criticizing (criticizing their own thoughts).

The comrades of Beijing Normal University also specially talked about the importance of the revolutionization of the leading cadres in their experience introduction. They said that after the establishment of the school revolutionary committee, we are the power-holders, whether we are holding the power of the proletariat or the bourgeoisie depends on whether we listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment step by step. The main responsible comrades of our school revolutionary committee have always placed the focus of their work on the school and personally grasped the criticism. In solving various ideological obstacles to the in-depth development of criticism, we first grasped the ideological transformation of leading cadres at all levels, organizing them to repeatedly study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's five criteria for proletarian revolutionary successors, overcoming petty-bourgeois vacillation, and firmly establishing the thought of serving the people. Many leaders of departments and classes went deep into the masses and took the lead in carrying out criticism well.

The comrades of Beijing Normal University said in their experience introduction that the deepest feeling is to put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the position of being first, heavy, great, and high above everything, launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command the revolutionary criticism. Criticism is a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The more we study Chairman Mao's works, the more we love Mao Zedong Thought, the more we hate China's Khrushchev and the revisionist line he promotes, the better we can improve the level of criticism. We also feel that revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" are the premise and organizational guarantee for carrying out criticism well. To carry out criticism in depth, we must combine criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units, and combine intellectuals with workers and peasants.

The comrades of higher education institutions attending the on-site meeting also carefully listened to the introduction of the experiences of revolutionary criticism in Shanghai and Shandong by Comrade Zhou Jingfang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, at the meeting. During the meeting, they also saw the big character posters pasted all over the tents, walls, and roads of Beijing Normal University, and participated in some department and class criticism meetings and lectures on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Ding Guoyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He said, the comrades of Beijing Normal University introduced very good experiences, and their revolutionary criticism was carried out relatively well. The experience lies in: to carry out revolutionary criticism well, the key is the leadership. Whether the leadership personally grasps the revolutionary criticism or not, whether they concentrate their energy and grasp it tightly or not. Secondly, to carry out revolutionary criticism well, it is important to grasp lively political and ideological work. If political and ideological work is done well, revolutionary criticism can be carried out vigorously and solidly. Thirdly, to carry out revolutionary criticism well, we must organize all revolutionary teachers and students, study Mao Zedong Thought together, collect materials together, research together, and revise criticism articles together, so that we can fight together and improve together. He said, revolutionary criticism is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the current revolutionary direction. We should carry out such experience exchange meetings to carry out criticism more vigorously and solidly.

Comrade Tan Hulan, the chairman of the Beijing Normal University Revolutionary Committee, said in her speech at the on-site meeting that today's on-site meeting is a great encouragement to us. She called on the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University to learn humbly from the revolutionary comrades of sister schools and carry out revolutionary criticism even better.

The meeting finally passed the "Raise High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Launch a New High Tide of Revolutionary Criticism, and Thoroughly Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters" initiative to the revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of higher education institutions in the capital, calling on the proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards of Chairman Mao in all higher education institutions in the city to enthusiastically respond to the great battle call of Comrade Lin Biao to "raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution," carry forward the glorious tradition of "revolutionary vanguard," further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution, and build new achievements!

    北京市革命委员会在师大召开革命大批判现场会向大专院校发出号召
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗掀起革命大批判新高潮
    彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部在文化大革命中立新功
    谢副总理要求大家认清大好形势，认真学习毛主席著作，不要外出串连，不要打“内战”，要联合起来有计划地搞大批判，实现革命的大联合和“三结合”，大破修正主义的教育制度，建立毛泽东思想的新教育制度。
    新华社二十二日讯　北京市革命委员会今天在北京师范大学召开了首都大专院校革命大批判现场会，由北京师范大学介绍了革命大批判的经验。会议号召，首都大专院校广大革命师生和红卫兵小将，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，总结经验，交流经验，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
    会议强调指出，当前无产阶级文化大革命进入了彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的决战阶段，形势一片大好，越来越好。无产阶级革命派必须认清形势，紧紧把握对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大揭发、大批判、大斗争的大方向，坚定不移地沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进，彻底地从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们打倒。会议要求首都大专院校的革命师生和红卫兵小将，正确认识当前的革命大批判和支左的关系，不要再外出串连，而要坐下来，好好活学活用毛主席著作，集中力量搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，这也就是对全国无产阶级革命派的最大支援。
    国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治、北京市革命委员会常委周景方、丁国钰等参加了今天的现场会。
    谢富治同志在会上讲话时，着重指出革命大批判的伟大意义。他说，革命的大批判，就是要把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把他们在各个领域里散布的修正主义流毒彻底肃清。这就要我们很好地学习毛泽东思想，掀起大学习的高潮。现在不是出去煽风点火的时候，而是要我们坐下来开动脑筋，进行革命的大批判，在革命的大批判中，实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合；在破修正主义的教育路线的基础上，建立起新的教育制度，毛泽东思想的教育制度。我们首都的大专院校要停止“内战”，联合起来有计划地搞大批判。我们要把革命的大批判搞好，在破的基础上搞出一个初步的新的教育制度，这就是对全国无产阶级革命派的最大支持。
    谢富治同志说，今天开这样的会，交流革命大批判的经验，很好。回去以后，大家都来总结经验，创造经验，把革命的大批判搞得更好。
    北京师范大学革命委员会负责人在会上介绍了他们学校开展革命大批判的经验；政教系、中文系毕业班的一个战斗队和外语系，还分别作了典型发言。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们介绍经验说，要搞好革命的大批判，就必须放手发动群众。在发动群众的过程中，要根据运动发展情况，反复进行革命大批判意义的教育，形势教育和阶级教育。我们进行革命大批判意义教育的作法是：利用大会小会和座谈讨论等各种形式，反复学习毛主席有关指示、中共中央五月十六日《通知》和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论，从而使广大革命师生认识到：当前进行的这场革命大批判，就是一场保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、保卫无产阶级专政的战斗，是两条路线斗争的继续。对待革命大批判的态度，就是对待文化大革命的态度，就是对待毛泽东思想的态度，就是对待毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度。革命的大批判是无产阶级革命派的伟大历史使命，是新的形势下“革”与“保”的问题，是对无产阶级革命派新的考验。这样，广大革命师生对革命大批判的伟大意义认识迅速提高。与此同时，我们还抓了阶级教育，开展了“两忆三查”活动，通过忆旧社会阶级压迫的苦和资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，思新社会的甜和毛主席革命路线的甜，进一步加深了广大革命师生对中国赫鲁晓夫的恨，增强对毛主席的无比热爱的感情，提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，从而以饱满的政治热情投入革命大批判的新高潮中去。
    他们介绍说，形势教育很重要，因为如果把形势看错了，就不可能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要把方向搞错。阶级敌人是最害怕革命大批判的，所以他们用种种手段干扰斗争大方向。而这种阶级斗争在革命队伍内部都有所反映，一部分师生安不下心来搞革命大批判，而热心外出串连，支援外地无产阶级革命派。校革命委员会，根据群众的思想情况，及时讲形势，报告全国各地无产阶级文化大革命的情况，召开形势分析会，组织学习讨论。通过经常的形势教育，广大师生明确了：敌人挑起武斗、制造混乱、向革命派进行反扑等现象都不能说明敌人的强大，恰恰是垂死挣扎的表现。我们就是要把仇恨集中到笔尖上，矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。经常性的形势教育，使广大革命师生能及时认清形势，不受干扰，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，广大革命师生在讨论中提出了“三坚持”“三反对”的建议，即坚持对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大斗争、大批判的大方向，反对打“内战”；坚持革命的大团结、大联合，反对分裂；坚持大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的文斗，反对武斗。这样就使革命大批判步步深入地开展起来。
    他们介绍根据不同情况，不同对象，作深入细致的政治思想工作时说，校革委会成立以后，我们针对师生中滋长的骄傲自满情绪，逍遥情绪进行了“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教育。我们狠抓红卫兵的思想工作，启发教育红卫兵在大批判中起先锋作用；教育毕业生要用搞好大批判的实际行动，站好最后一班岗；教育教师丢掉怕字，树立敢字，到同学中去，和同学一起投入大批判。经过一系列细致的思想工作，逍遥派大为减少，广大革命师生大批判的热情迅速提高。在出现了“写大字报就是一切”，只顾数量，不顾质量，只搞大批判，不管人的思想革命化等单纯军事观点时，我们针对这种单纯军事观点，组织师生学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，引导师生自觉地通过讲用会、整风会、谈心会，克服这种思想，把大批判和思想革命化结合起来。有些班级还创造了边学习（学习毛主席著作）边对照（对照自己的思想）边批判的经验。
    北京师范大学的同志在经验介绍中还特别谈到了领导班子革命化的重要性。他们说，校革委会成立以后，我们是当权派，我们当的是无产阶级的权，还是资产阶级的权，就看我们是不是听毛主席的话，步步紧跟毛主席的战略部署。我们校革委会的主要负责人一直把工作的基点放在校内，亲自抓大批判。在解决大批判深入开展的种种思想障碍时，首先抓了各级领导班子的思想革命化，组织他们反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项标准，克服小资产阶级摇摆性，牢固地树立为人民服务的思想。不少系、班的领导深入群众，带头搞好大批判。
    北京师范大学的同志们在介绍经验时都说，体会最深的一点就是要把毛主席著作的学习放在先于一切、重于一切、大于一切、高于一切的地位，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判。大批判就是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，越学习毛主席著作，越热爱毛泽东思想，越憎恨中国的赫鲁晓夫及其推行的修正主义路线，就越能提高大批判的水平。我们也体会到革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”是搞好大批判的前提和组织保证。要把大批判深入开展下去，必须把大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来，知识分子和工农兵结合起来。
    出席现场会的大专院校的同志，还十分注意地听了市革命委员会常委周景方同志在会上介绍的上海、山东等地革命大批判的经验。会议期间，他们还看了北京师范大学贴满了席棚、楼墙、马路的大字报，分别参加了一些系、班的批判会和活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。
    北京市革命委员会常委丁国钰同志也在会上讲了话。他说，北京师范大学的同志们介绍了很好的经验，他们的革命大批判搞得比较好，经验就在于：要搞好革命的大批判，关键在于领导。领导是亲自抓革命的大批判，还是不亲自抓，是集中精力抓得很紧，还是抓而不紧。其次，要搞好革命的大批判，抓活的政治思想工作很重要。政治思想工作作好了，革命的大批判就可以轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地搞起来。第三，要搞好革命的大批判，还要把革命师生都组织起来，共同学习毛泽东思想，共同收集材料，共同研究，共同修改批判文章，这样就可以共同战斗，共同提高。他说，革命的大批判，这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是当前的革命大方向，我们要通过这样的经验交流会，把大批判搞得更加轰轰烈烈，更加扎扎实实。
    北京师范大学革命委员会主任谭厚兰同志在现场会议讲话时说，今天的现场会，是对我们一个很大的鞭策。她号召北师大的革命师生，一定要虚心向兄弟院校的革命战友学习，把革命的大批判搞得更好。
    会议最后通过了向首都大专院校广大革命师生和红卫兵小将发出的《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部》的倡议书，号召全市高等学校的无产阶级革命派，毛主席的红卫兵，坚决热烈地响应林副统帅“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大战斗号召，发扬“革命先锋”的光荣传统，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，为无产阶级文化大革命立新功，建新劳！
