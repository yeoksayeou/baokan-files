The publication of the editorial "The Great Chinese People's Liberation Army is the Reliable Pillar of Our Proletarian Dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" in the 14th issue of the *Red Flag* magazine has greatly inspired the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the PLA's army, navy, and air force. During the study and discussion of this editorial, the soldiers of the three services unanimously agreed that this is the highest honor and greatest encouragement given by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the People's Liberation Army. It is also a new and higher demand placed on the PLA in the great situation of achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They solemnly declared that they would definitely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of loving the people, and with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and boundless loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, they would swear to be the staunch backbone of the proletarian revolutionaries, actively support and resolutely defend the broad masses of the leftists, fight shoulder to shoulder with them, unite and struggle together, and strive to excellently complete the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the garrison troops in Wuhan, Changsha, Zhengzhou, and Nanchang have forged deep revolutionary friendship with the local proletarian revolutionaries. After studying the editorial of the *Red Flag*, they expressed with fighting enthusiasm that they would definitely hold high the banner of loving the people, further strengthen the close unity between the military and the people, fight together against the enemy, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the PLA's 8050, 8047, 8048, and 8119 units, who have given firm support to the Ningxia proletarian revolutionaries in the fierce struggle, said, "We must, with the greatest political enthusiasm, the highest fighting will, and the most confident victory, firmly support the Ningxia Proletarian Revolutionary Headquarters, form an iron fist with them, thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in the Ningxia region, and make new contributions to achieving even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In Zhejiang's Wenzhou, the 6517 and 6299 units, which are fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries, were also extremely excited after hearing the editorial on the radio and expressed, "All the victories we have achieved so far are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To defend the great leader Chairman Mao, to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire."

The responsible comrade Fang Ming of a certain unit in the Wuhan troops, who has made new achievements in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, said, "The PLA doing a good job in supporting the left is the greatest way of loving the people. In the future, we must more firmly and wholeheartedly support the left, publicize the heroic fighting deeds of the left, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the left, protect the left, and establish the prestige of the left. In the great criticism of the revolution, we will develop and strengthen the leftist forces and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

Many PLA officers and soldiers who have made great contributions on the front lines of supporting the left have expressed that in the face of victory, they must correctly treat themselves and the work of the previous period, better believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and do an even better job of supporting the left. The officers and soldiers of the 3174, 7111, and 3792 units of the Anshan garrison troops and the 3168 unit of the Yanbian garrison troops, who have always fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries, have expressed that they will definitely take the praise given by Chairman Mao and the people to the PLA as a great driving force for the people to create new achievements. We have only the responsibility to do our work humbly and cautiously, and we have no right to be arrogant and complacent. The people love the PLA, and we must love the people a thousand times more. The red flag of supporting the left that is flying high on the Shaanbei plateau—the People's Armed Department of Mizi County and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the garrison troops fighting on the front lines of supporting the left in Shaanxi—enthusiastically welcomed the great inspiration brought by the editorial of the *Red Flag*. The comrades of the Mizi County People's Armed Department said, "In the past, under the difficult situation of being 'pressed from above, attacked from below, and surrounded on all sides,' we listened to Chairman Mao's words, stood up, and firmly supported the revolutionary leftists, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly demoralizing the bourgeoisie. In the future, we will more firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary leftists, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and in the great storms of the revolution, share life and death with them and swear to be their staunch backbone."

The leadership and broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou troops who firmly support the "Red Three Commands" of Gansu have, in accordance with the spirit of the editorial of the *Red Flag*, reviewed their work of supporting the left in the previous period. They followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao to "sum up achievements, correct mistakes, and be ready for the next battle," actively sought opinions from the comrades of the "Red Three Commands," and improved their work. They expressed: We will definitely hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the grand direction of the struggle, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in the Gansu region, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the 7848, 7799, and 7812 units and other units who are fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries in Sichuan expressed after listening to the radio broadcast of the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine that they would not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and would be more humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, and make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The 7350 unit, which has always firmly supported the proletarian revolutionaries in the Zhejiang region, has, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fought together with the broad masses of the left and achieved great victories. The responsible comrade of this unit said, "We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of 'the masses are the real heroes,' forever believe in and rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters."

In the process of supporting the left, some units' responsible comrades, due to lack of experience, had some shortcomings or mistakes. After publicly checking and correcting their shortcomings and mistakes, they were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. During the study of the editorial of the *Red Flag*, they seriously summarized their experiences and lessons. The officers and soldiers of the 6003 unit of the Yantai garrison troops in Shandong said, "Facts have proven that the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses love the People's Liberation Army the most. The officers and soldiers expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly correct shortcomings and mistakes, and swear to do an even better job of the 'three supports' and 'two militaries' work entrusted by Chairman Mao, and create new achievements for the people."

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the units in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Xining, Taiyuan, Guiyang, Harbin, Hohhot, and Kunming have also held various meetings in the past two days to seriously study the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine, discuss the great situation of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the army's work of supporting the left, summarize the experiences of supporting the left, and decide to continue advancing. With unparalleled high fighting spirit, they firmly declared that in the great storms of class struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they would definitely establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand together with the proletarian revolutionaries, and fight to the end to defend the red bastion of the proletariat by deeply and thoroughly criticizing and exposing China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.
