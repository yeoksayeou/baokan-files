Wuhan revolutionary factions held a mobilization rally on the afternoon of August 21 to seize the revolution and promote production. They are determined to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement the great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. They vow to be models of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The meeting was presided over by the Wuhan Revolutionary Faction Command Center for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production, which was recently formed by revolutionary organizations such as "Steel Workers General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel 913," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Command Revolutionary Alliance."

The responsible person from the Command Center for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production first spoke at the meeting. He called on proletarian revolutionary workers to seize the revolution with the attitude of masters, vigorously promote production, and create new achievements for the people on the production front.

Representatives from "Steel Workers General" and "Steel 913" expressed their determination at the rally. They said, "We, the working class, are the masters of the state. Seizing the revolution and promoting production is our duty and responsibility. We will not let down the expectations of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make him proud. We must work harder and achieve double victories in revolution and production."

Representatives from the Han Yang Rolling Mill and the Wuhan Meat Processing Plant introduced their experiences of firmly holding their production positions, seizing the revolution, and promoting production.

The responsible person from the Wuhan Garrison Command, who was invited to attend the rally, also spoke at the meeting.
