There can be no people's everything without a people's army. The heroic People's Liberation Army has built great merits for the people. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have loyally carried out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" given by Chairman Mao during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have built new merits for the people. The proletarian revolutionary masses must raise the banner of supporting the army and sincerely assist the People's Liberation Army in doing their work.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, our correspondent reports: The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the great leader Chairman Mao's personally founded and led, and Deputy Chairman Lin Biao's directly commanded People's Liberation Army, have, over the past year in the great proletarian cultural revolution that has shaken the world, held high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, made new and greatest contributions to defending socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and built new merits for the people.

The heroic soldiers have built great merits in the new stage of socialist revolution in our motherland, which shows: The great People's Liberation Army of China is truly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a unique and strongest revolutionary army in the world that is truly in the hands of the people, a loyal defender of our great motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a reliable pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a strong backing for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and a new-type people's army that establishes the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China have deeply felt from their forty-year glorious fighting course: "Following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory!" When the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, all the officers and soldiers of the army, with great excitement, guarded the coastal defense and borders of the motherland with doubled vigilance, and with the greatest enthusiasm, threw themselves into the great struggle of defending Chairman Mao, defending Deputy Chairman Lin, and defending the Central Committee of the Party.

The imperialists headed by the United States and all reactionaries, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and a handful of devils of the old world are terrified and hateful of the great torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They have gone mad with anti-China hysteria and have recklessly provoked the Chinese people. In the past year, the Johnson administration of the United States dispatched 128 of its bandit aircraft to intrude into our airspace 72 times, and 31 of its pirate warships to intrude into our territorial waters 42 times. The running dogs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the reactionary Indian regime, have also repeatedly provoked our border defense troops from the ground and the air. The traitorous Chiang Kai-shek gang, who are holed up in Taiwan, under the orders of their American masters, are still not giving up and are stirring. The heroic People's Liberation Army has given these provocateurs a resolute rebuff. The air force and naval aviation units have, since last August, shot down 7 U.S. aircraft of various types that intruded into our airspace and damaged 2; they have shot down 1 U.S.-made Chiang bandit fighter plane. The powerful naval fleet has also heavily struck the enemy that has been harassing at sea and has excellently completed the task of protecting fishing and navigation. Once, a U.S.-made Chiang boat attempted to raid our coastal areas, and our heroic warship immediately attacked, sinking the enemy boat in the sea. On another night, a U.S.-Chiang spy ship entered our coastal waters, and one of our warships, with lightning speed, rushed towards the enemy ship, capturing the enemy along with the ship. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, together with the militias and the people, have formed an iron wall along the long border and coastal defense lines, firmly defending the safety of the motherland.

The heroic officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force have paid great efforts and devoted all their energy to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the capital, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing have, day and night, guarded the highest command of the proletariat with doubled vigilance. Tens of thousands of revolutionary youngsters from all over the country have come to Beijing, and the soldiers, learning from the great leader Chairman Mao's great practice of loving and supporting the revolutionary masses the most, have enthusiastically received and trained hundreds of thousands of revolutionary youngsters, arranged their food and accommodation, and taught them the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. They have ensured that they happily met Chairman Mao eight times, safely conducted revolutionary tours, and escorted them to various parts of the country to spread the sparks of the Cultural Revolution. In various parts of the country, the heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have also built immortal merits for defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and defending the new revolutionary order. On how many days of struggle, they have stood guard for the Red Guards who have gone out to society to break the Four Olds and sweep away the ghosts and monsters, not allowing the class enemies to harm a hair of the revolutionary youngsters; on how many nights, they have patrolled for the great debates and great criticisms in cities and rural areas, guarding the fighting rights of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, not allowing a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party to seek opportunities for class revenge. At a critical moment when a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and a handful of bad heads insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line in the "million-strong army" and the "procuratorate, public security, and court" openly defied the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and defied the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have been fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan stood up and, together with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, firmly smashed the enemy's fierce attacks.

The heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have, with the greatest enthusiasm, the highest initiative, and the most resolute actions, loyally carried out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" given by the great leader Chairman Mao. They have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with a clear stand and a distinct banner, united with the broad masses of the left, fought with them, and won with them. They have armed the revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to expose and criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in a high-profile manner; they have, with Chairman Mao's teachings that the proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all mankind, guided the proletarian revolutionary masses to correctly treat themselves, correctly treat the cadres, and correctly treat the deceived masses, promoting great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism of the revolution; they have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production," in factories and rural areas, through carrying out the great criticism of the revolution, aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. They have done a great deal of work in the "three supports and two militaries" and have achieved great results, building new merits for the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has once again irrefutably proven: Chairman Mao's proposition is a great truth. Without the People's Liberation Army personally founded by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Deputy Chairman Lin, it would have been impossible to carry out this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; without the People's Liberation Army that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would not have achieved today's brilliant results. The great People's Liberation Army of China is the glory and pride of our great motherland.

    没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切
    英雄的解放军为人民建树了丰功伟绩
    广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命中，忠实执行了毛主席交给的“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，为人民建立了新功劳。无产阶级革命派要高举拥军的旗帜，真诚地协助解放军做好工作。
    据新华社十九日讯　本社记者报道：伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军的广大指战员，一年来在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为保卫社会主义祖国和无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的最伟大的贡献，为人民立了新功。
    英雄战士们在祖国社会主义革命新阶段所建树的丰功伟绩表明：伟大的中国人民解放军，不愧为无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，真正掌握在人民手里的举世无双的最强大的革命军队，不愧为我们伟大祖国和无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者，无产阶级专政的可靠支柱，世界人民革命斗争的坚强后盾，不愧为毛泽东思想的大学校，树立了毛泽东思想绝对权威的新型人民军队。
    英雄的中国人民解放军广大指战员，从四十年光辉的战斗历程中深深体会到：“紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就是胜利！”当史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命刚刚兴起的时候，全军指战员就怀着无比激动的心情，以百倍的警惕保卫着祖国的海防和边疆，以最大的热情，投入了保卫毛主席、保卫林副主席、保卫党中央的伟大战斗。
    以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义等一小撮旧世界的魔鬼，对于中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大洪流，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们大发反华歇斯底里，猖狂向中国人民寻衅。在过去一年中，美国约翰逊政府派出它的强盗飞机一百二十八架，侵入我领空达七十二次，派出海盗军舰三十一艘，侵入我领海达四十二次。美帝和苏修的走卒印度反动派也多次从地面和空中向我边防部队进行了猖狂的军事挑衅。盘踞在台湾的民族败类蒋介石匪帮，在它的美国主子的指使下，更贼心不死，蠢蠢欲动。英雄的中国人民解放军给了这些挑衅者以坚决的回击。空军部队和海军航空兵部队，从去年八月以来，一共打落入侵我领空的美国各种型号的强盗飞机七架、打伤两架；打落美制蒋匪帮战斗机一架。强大的海军舰艇部队，也沉重地打击了海上窜扰的敌人，出色地完成了护渔护航任务。一次，一艘美制蒋艇妄图偷袭我沿海地区，我英雄战艇立即出击，将敌艇击沉在大海中。另一天深夜，一条美蒋特务船进入我沿海，我一艘战艇以迅雷不及掩耳的高速直扑贼船，把敌人连人带船全部揪了回来。人民解放军指战员就这样和民兵、人民群众一起，在漫长的边防、海防线上结成一道铜墙铁壁，坚强地保卫着祖国的安全。
    英雄的陆海空军指战员，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命付出了巨大的辛劳，贡献了全部精力。在首都，守卫在毛主席身边的北京卫戍区和驻京部队广大指战员，日日夜夜，百倍警惕地守卫着无产阶级最高司令部。成千上万的革命小将从五湖四海来到北京，战士们学习伟大统帅毛主席最热爱革命群众、最支持革命群众的伟大实践，以极大的热忱，接待和训练了成百万名革命小将，为他们安排食宿，传授人民解放军的光荣传统。保证他们八次幸福地会见毛主席，安全地进行革命大串连，并护送他们到全国各地传播文化大革命的火种。在全国各地，英雄的人民解放军指战员也为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫革命的新秩序，立下了不朽的功勋。多少个战斗的白天，他们为走上社会，大破四旧，横扫牛鬼蛇神的红卫兵小将站岗放哨，不许阶级敌人伤害革命小将的一根毫毛；多少个夜晚，他们为城市和农村的革命大辩论、大批判巡逻，护卫着亿万革命群众战斗的权利，不准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派寻机进行阶级报复。在武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”、“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头公开对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，对抗无产阶级文化大革命的严重时刻，紧紧同武汉革命派战斗在一起的人民解放军指战员们挺身而出，同武汉地区无产阶级革命派紧紧团结在一起，坚决粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。
    英雄的人民解放军指战员们，以最大的热情，最高的积极性，最坚决的行动，忠实执行了伟大统帅毛主席交给的“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。他们坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明，同左派广大群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命派的头脑，发动广大革命群众，大张旗鼓地揭发和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；他们以毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类才能解放自己等教导，引导无产阶级革命派正确对待自己、正确对待干部和正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，在革命的大批判中，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”；他们遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在工厂、农村，通过开展革命的大批判，调动广大工农群众的革命热情和生产积极性，推动工农业生产的发展。他们在“三支”“两军”中做了大量的工作，取得了巨大的成绩，为人民立了新功。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”无产阶级文化大革命的实践，再一次无可辩驳地证明：毛主席这一论断是一个伟大的真理。没有毛主席亲手缔造，林彪副主席亲自指挥的人民解放军，就不可能进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命；没有无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的人民解放军，无产阶级文化大革命也不可能取得今天这样辉煌的战绩。伟大的中国人民解放军，是我们伟大祖国的光荣和骄傲。
