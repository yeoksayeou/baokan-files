The color documentary film "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" has met with revolutionary comrades of the proletariat and people from all over the country and the world, at a time when the nation is launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle, and is giving a thorough beating to the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

To sing the praises of the red sun in our hearts, to portray the brilliant image of our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, is the happiest thing and a great and glorious political task for us workers in newsreel films. We always think: How can we most fully and perfectly express the boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty of the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world for Chairman Mao? When Chairman Mao appears again and again among the revolutionary masses, when his old hands receive the countless hands of the masses reaching out to him, when Chairman Mao talks intimately with international communist fighters from the five continents, when the envoys of the heroic people of South Vietnam embrace the greatest leader of the world proletariat, Chairman Mao, when the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, shouts "Comrades, long live!" from the Tiananmen Gate to the revolutionary people of the whole world... When these great scenes of historic significance appear before our eyes, as editors of the film, what should we say to the revolutionary audience of the whole country and the world? We feel that no matter how many words we write, it is better to let Chairman Mao's loud voice resonate around the globe; no matter how many songs we sing, it is better to let the sincere voices of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" resound through the sky. The language spoken by tens of thousands of revolutionary masses is the most sincere, the most simple, and the most expressive—Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Father and mother are not as dear as you; the river is deep and the sea is deep, but not as deep as your kindness.

The brilliant image of our great leader, Chairman Mao, and his old voice, are always inspiring us. This is the greatest source of strength and the greatest happiness for all the personnel who participated in the production of this film. This film was also shot during the great criticism movement. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards, strongly denounced and hated the Chinese Khrushchev. This gave us endless strength when we filmed the fearless fighting posture of the revolutionary masses.

For seventeen years, the newsreel film industry has been under the control of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, opposing the propagation of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and deliberately belittling the brilliant image of Chairman Mao. On the contrary, they have extolled the Chinese Khrushchev and paved the way for the restoration of capitalism. Now, the Chinese Khrushchev has been exposed, and the beautiful dream of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party has been shattered. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of giving the fallen dog a thorough beating, and resolutely, together with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry the great criticism through to the end, and win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let the screen of our country's newsreel films forever radiate the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    人民无限爱领袖　领袖无限爱人民
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂编辑　王相武　白国柱
    在举国掀起革命大批判的新高潮，痛打落水狗——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派时，彩色文献纪录片《欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利》与无产阶级革命派的战友们和全国人民、全世界人民见面了。
    歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳，表现我们最伟大的领袖毛主席的光辉形象，是我们新闻纪录电影工作者最最幸福的事情，也是一项巨大而光荣的政治任务。我们总是这样想：怎样才能最充分最完美地表达出全国人民和全世界革命人民对毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚呢？当毛主席一次又一次的出现在革命群众中间，他老人家的巨手每次接过群众伸过来的无数双手的时候，当毛主席同来自世界五大洲的国际共产主义战士亲密无间地交谈的时候，当英雄的越南南方人民的使者紧紧拥抱世界无产阶级最杰出的领袖毛主席的时候，当世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席在天安门上向全世界革命人民高呼“同志们万岁！”的时候……，当这些具有光辉历史意义的伟大场面出现在我们眼前的时候，作为影片编辑，我们应该向全国和全世界的革命观众讲些什么才好呢？我们觉得，写千言道万语，不如让毛主席他老人家洪亮的声音响彻全球；唱万歌谱千曲，不如让亿万革命群众发自肺腑的呼声：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！！”响彻云霄。成千成万革命群众说出的语言最真挚、最朴素、最富有表现力——毛主席啊，毛主席！爹亲娘亲，不如您老人家亲；河深海深，不如您老人家恩情深。
    伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象，他老人家的亲切的声音，时刻在鼓舞着我们，这是参加这部影片摄制工作全体人员最大力量的源泉，最大幸福的所在。这部影片又是在大批判运动中摄制的，广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将对中国的赫鲁晓夫的愤怒声讨和强烈憎恨，时刻在激发着我们。在拍摄革命群众大无畏的战斗姿态时，也给我们增添了无穷的力量。
    十七年来，新闻纪录电影事业在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，反对宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，极力贬低毛主席的光辉形象。相反，却大肆美化中国的赫鲁晓夫，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。现在，中国的赫鲁晓夫被揪出来了，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的黄粱美梦也破灭了。我们要发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，坚决和工农兵群众一起，把革命的大批判进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。让我国新闻纪录电影银幕上，永远放射着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！
