	The Chinese Embassy Strongly Protests the Murder of Patriotic Overseas Chinese Leader Liu Yingchao by the Burmese Government
	The Chinese People Must Demand Blood Debt from the Burmese Reactionary Government

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 23rd: Rangoon news: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, strongly protesting the fascist atrocity of the Ne Win reactionary government in brutally murdering Liu Yingchao, the leader of the patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma and the chairman of the Burma Overseas Chinese Workers' Federation, in prison.

	The note pointed out: This is another new bloody crime and blood debt that the Burmese reactionary government has committed against the Chinese people after massacring patriotic overseas Chinese in Rangoon and throughout Burma. The Chinese Embassy solemnly declares that the Chinese people must avenge Liu Yingchao and must demand blood debt from the Burmese reactionary government!

	The Chinese Embassy firmly demands that the Burmese reactionary government: 1. Immediately arrange for Chinese Embassy officials to visit the Yezin Prison in Rangoon to meet with detained overseas Chinese and other relevant individuals to investigate the circumstances of Liu Yingchao's death on the spot; 2. Severely punish the perpetrators and planners, and compensate the families of the victims; 3. Hold a solemn funeral and burial ceremony for Liu Yingchao; 4. Immediately and unconditionally release all innocent detained patriotic overseas Chinese; 5. Immediately stop the illegal interrogation and persecution of illegally detained overseas Chinese.

	The note said that Liu Yingchao was a patriotic shoemaker. During his decades of residence in Burma, he consistently lived in harmony with the Burmese people, consistently promoted traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and worked tirelessly for the welfare of the broad masses of overseas Chinese workers in Burma, earning the respect and love of the Burmese working people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese workers in Burma.

	The note sternly pointed out that after murdering Liu Yingchao, the Burmese reactionary government shamelessly claimed that Liu Yingchao died of illness in prison, and despite repeated warnings from the Chinese Embassy, staged a farce of an autopsy behind the back of the Chinese Embassy in an attempt to destroy evidence and evade responsibility. However, the Burmese reactionary government's clumsy tactics only further exposed their ugly faces as murderers, but did not reduce their guilt in the slightest. The note said that Liu Yingchao, while in prison, faced the fascist persecution of the Burmese reactionary government, always held high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and fought bravely and unyieldingly to defend Mao Zedong Thought, maintain the dignity of the motherland, and defend the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese in Burma to love the great leader Chairman Mao and the motherland. Liu Yingchao is indeed a good son of the Chinese people and a good example for patriotic overseas Chinese! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: People must die, but the meaning of death is different. To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai. Liu Yingchao's death is heavier than Mount Tai. Although Liu Yingchao has sacrificed himself gloriously, his great image will forever live in the hearts of the peoples of China and Burma and the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese. The Burmese reactionary government's murder of Liu Yingchao does not prove its strength but shows that it is approaching its doom. The Burmese reactionary government's new fascist atrocity will only deepen the hatred of the peoples of China and Burma and patriotic overseas Chinese towards the Burmese reactionaries, strengthen their resolve to fight to the end, and thus hasten the doom of the Burmese reactionary government!

	The note finally once again sternly warns the Burmese reactionary government: "The patriotic overseas Chinese you have illegally detained are the flesh and blood of the Chinese people. You must release them all alive immediately, not one less."

    我使馆最强烈抗议缅甸政府杀害爱国华侨领袖刘应超
    中国人民一定要向缅甸反动政府讨还血债
    据新华社二十三日讯  仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十二日照会缅甸外交部，最强烈地抗议奈温反动政府在狱中残酷杀害缅甸爱国华侨领袖、缅甸华侨工人联合会主席刘应超的法西斯暴行。
    照会指出：这是缅甸反动政府继在仰光和全缅各地大肆屠杀爱国华侨以后，对中国人民所犯下的又一新的血腥罪行，所欠下的又一笔新的血债。中国大使馆庄严宣告，中国人民一定要为刘应超报仇，一定要向缅甸反动政府讨还这笔血债！
    中国大使馆坚决要求缅甸反动政府：一、立即安排中国大使馆官员前往仰光永盛监狱会见被捕华侨和其他有关人员对刘应超被害情况进行现场调查；二、严惩凶手及策划者，抚恤受害家属；三、为刘应超举行隆重的追悼和安葬仪式；四、立即无条件全部释放无辜被捕的爱国华侨；五、立即停止对非法逮捕的华侨的非法审讯和迫害。
    照会说，刘应超是一位爱国的皮鞋工人。在他旅居缅甸的数十年中，他一贯同缅甸人民和睦相处，一贯促进中缅两国人民间的传统友谊和为广大旅缅华侨工人群众的福利事业奔走，受到缅甸劳动人民和旅缅广大华侨工人群众的尊敬和爱戴。
    照会严正指出，缅甸反动政府在杀害了刘应超以后，竟胡说什么刘应超是在狱中病故，并不顾中国大使馆多次警告，背着中国大使馆导演了一场自欺欺人的验尸丑剧，妄图销毁罪证，逃避罪责。但是，缅甸反动政府这种笨拙的手法除了更进一步暴露其杀人凶手的丑恶嘴脸以外，丝毫也不能减轻其罪责。照会说，刘应超在监狱中，面对着缅甸反动政府法西斯的迫害，始终高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为捍卫毛泽东思想，维护祖国的尊严和维护旅缅广大爱国华侨热爱伟大领袖毛主席和热爱祖国的正当权利，同缅甸反动政府进行了英勇不屈的斗争。刘应超不愧为中国人民的好儿子和海外爱国华侨的好榜样！我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。刘应超的死比泰山还重。刘应超虽然光荣地牺牲了，但是他的高大的形象将永远活在中缅两国人民和广大爱国华侨的心中。缅甸反动政府杀害刘应超绝不说明其强大，只说明它已临近灭亡，缅甸反动政府这一新的法西斯暴行必将加深中缅人民和爱国华侨对缅甸反动派的仇恨，加强他们斗争到底的决心，从而加速缅甸反动政府的灭亡！
    照会最后再一次严重警告缅甸反动政府：“被你们非法逮捕的爱国华侨是中国人民的亲骨肉，你们把他们活着非法逮捕进去，你们必须把他们立即全部活着释放出来，少一个也不行。”
