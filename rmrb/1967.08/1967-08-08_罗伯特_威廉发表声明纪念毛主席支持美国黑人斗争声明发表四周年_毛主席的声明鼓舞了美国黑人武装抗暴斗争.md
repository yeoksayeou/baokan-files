Robert Williams Issues Statement Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Statement Supporting the Struggle of American Blacks

Chairman Mao's Statement Inspires Armed Resistance Against Violence by American Blacks

New China News Agency, August 7th - August 8th marks the fourth anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement supporting the just struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism. In a statement issued on this occasion, American black leader Robert Williams said that Chairman Mao is the first world leader to elevate the struggle of American blacks to the level of world revolution. Inspired by Chairman Mao's statement, American blacks are increasingly turning to armed revolutionary resistance.

The statement said that on August 8, 1963, the founder of people's war, Chairman Mao Zedong, issued a historic statement supporting the just struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism. Currently, the nature and intensity of the struggle of the oppressed blacks in the United States undeniably prove the influence of Mao Zedong Thought on the oppressed peoples of the world. Like their oppressed brothers and sisters around the world, American blacks are inspired and have raised their struggle to a new revolutionary level. The correctness of Chairman Mao's August 8, 1963 statement has been proven by the widespread armed uprisings that have occurred under the brutal rule of imperialism in the United States.

The statement said that in his famous statement, Chairman Mao said: "American blacks are awakening, and their resistance is becoming stronger. In recent years, the mass struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights has been developing."

The statement pointed out that the passive resistance movement is completely losing its appeal, and the oppressed blacks are increasingly turning to armed revolutionary resistance. Due to the flames of the black liberation movement burning in some major cities in the United States, the Johnson administration, in its desperate struggle to suppress the brave uprisings, is becoming increasingly crazy and brutal. The U.S. government is barbarically and viciously arresting tens of thousands of blacks and their leaders. It has sent tens of thousands of troops armed with modern weapons of war to massacre and destroy the long-suffering victims of its fascist tyranny.

The statement emphasized that the tide of the struggle of American blacks for freedom is unstoppable. Johnson's savage suppression measures are only "lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet." The flames of people's war cannot be extinguished by tyrants. This is the era of Mao Zedong, the era of world revolution, and the liberation struggle of American blacks is a component of an invincible world-wide movement. Chairman Mao is the first world leader to elevate our people's struggle to the level of world revolution. According to the principles of people's war, that is, the oppressed masses of the world are the rural masses surrounding the cities (industrialized countries engaged in exploitation), American black revolutionaries are the powerful urban guerrilla forces within the cities. Our people will further develop and master people's war. Each battle will become a glorious monument to Chairman Mao's August 8, 1963 statement. We will increasingly resist the tyranny of racist U.S. imperialism. We will forever be inspired by the fact that Chairman Mao said: "...the evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which prospered with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

    罗伯特·威廉发表声明纪念毛主席支持美国黑人斗争声明发表四周年
    毛主席的声明鼓舞了美国黑人武装抗暴斗争
    新华社七日讯　八月八日，是毛主席关于支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明发表四周年，美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉就此发表的声明说，毛主席是把美国黑人斗争提高到世界革命范围的第一位世界领袖。美国黑人受到毛主席声明的鼓舞，正在越来越多地转入武装的革命抵抗。
    声明说，一九六三年八月八日，人民战争的创始人毛泽东主席发表了具有历史意义的支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明。目前，美国被压迫黑人斗争的性质和激烈程度，不可否认地证明了毛泽东思想对全世界被压迫人民的影响。美国黑人象他们在世界各地的被压迫的兄弟一样，受到鼓舞，把他们的斗争水平提高到新的革命的高度。毛主席一九六三年八月八日声明的正确性，已经为在帝国主义暴虐统治下的美国广泛出现武装暴动所证实。
    声明说，毛主席在他的世界著名的声明中说：“美国黑人正在觉醒，他们的反抗日益强烈。近几年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的群众性斗争，有日益发展的趋势。”
    声明指出，消极抵抗的虚假的运动正在完全丧失人心，被压迫的黑人越来越多地转入了武装的革命抵抗。由于美国的一些大城市燃起了美国黑人的解放运动的烈火，约翰逊政府在镇压英勇的暴动的拚命挣扎中，越来越疯狂和残暴。美国政府正在横蛮恶毒地逮捕数以千计的黑人和他们的领袖。它派遣了用现代战争武器武装起来的数以千计的军队，去屠杀和摧残它的法西斯暴政的长期受害者。
    声明强调说，美国黑人争取自由斗争的浪潮是制止不了的。约翰逊野蛮的镇压措施只不过是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。人民战争的火焰不是暴君所能扑灭的。这是毛泽东时代，世界革命的时代，而美国黑人的解放斗争是一个战无不胜的世界范围的运动的组成部分。毛主席是把我们人民的斗争提高到世界革命范围的第一个世界领袖。按照人民战争的原则，即全世界被剥削的人民大众是包围城市（从事剥削的工业国家）的农村群众，美国黑人革命者是城市内部的强大的城市地下军。我们人民将进一步发展和掌握人民战争。每一场战斗都要成为毛主席一九六三年八月八日声明的光荣的纪念碑，我们将越来越猛烈地抵抗种族主义的美帝国主义的暴政。我们将永远受到毛主席所说的这一事实的鼓舞：“……万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
