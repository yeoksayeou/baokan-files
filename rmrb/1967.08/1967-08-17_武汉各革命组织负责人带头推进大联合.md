	Firmly follow the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and do not disappoint the expectations of the broad revolutionary masses. Revolutionary organizations in Wuhan take the lead in promoting great unity.

	The leaders of revolutionary organizations such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance" gathered together for a cordial discussion. They unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to unite more closely, to concentrate their firepower, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, pushing the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan to a new stage.

	New China News Agency, Wuhan, August 14th - In the midst of the nation's fervent celebration of the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, and amidst the new revolutionary upsurge of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, the leaders of revolutionary organizations in Wuhan, who bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, gathered for a cordial discussion. They unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further unite more closely, to further consolidate their unity, to concentrate their targets, and to concentrate their firepower, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and launching a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, pushing the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan to a new stage.

	The common revolutionary goal requires great unity and great alliance

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The isolation of the enemy does not equal our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory." The comrades participating in the discussion unanimously pointed out that in the face of the great victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must see that although the enemy is politically isolated, they will not readily accept their defeat. They will still resort to new tricks, plot new conspiracies, and put up desperate resistance. We must never let down our revolutionary vigilance and become complacent, otherwise, we will suffer great losses and fall into traps. The glorious mission bestowed upon us proletarian revolutionaries by history is to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, to root out all those who have infiltrated the Party, the government, and the military and are taking the capitalist road, and to politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrow and expose them. The common revolutionary goal urgently requires us to unite more closely and ally more closely; only by uniting and fighting together can we defeat the class enemy and achieve complete victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The leaders of "Steel General" and "New Hua Farmers" said: China's Khrushchev has been exposed, and his agents in Wuhan have also been exposed. This is the greatest victory and the most brilliant achievement of the proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, we must see that they are not frozen snakes, nor are they drowning dogs; they will still struggle desperately. The practice of class struggle tells us that when the enemy is in a disadvantageous position, they will always use the method of splitting the revolutionary ranks. We must be highly vigilant. Currently, the arduous task of struggle facing us is still very heavy, and the road of struggle is still long. We should unite better, ally better, unite against the enemy, and relentlessly pursue and attack China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" and "Public Prosecution and Law Enforcement" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This is the requirement of the times and the common call of the broad revolutionary masses.

	The leader of "New Lake University" said: The current revolutionary situation in Wuhan urgently requires us proletarian revolutionaries to achieve the broadest revolutionary great alliance. Over the past year, the class struggle has educated us. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and his agents in Wuhan, although they have lost their prestige, will not readily accept their failure. They will still dress up and look for opportunities to attack us. In the face of the enemy, all revolutionary organizations must further consolidate their unity and alliance, and fiercely strike down the enemy.

	The leaders of "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance" said: The better unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan is the ardent hope of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and it is also the requirement of the people of the whole country. We have no reason not to unite better and ally better to deal with the common enemy. The enemy is most afraid of our revolutionary great unity, and we must double our efforts to enhance unity. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We must always remember this truth, be vigilant, and prevent the enemy's sabotage and provocation. We proletarian revolutionaries must take bigger steps and shoulder heavier burdens, unite the broad revolutionary masses in Wuhan, organize a surging revolutionary army, and launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Unity and solidarity, with one heart and one mind, any powerful enemy, any difficult environment, will surrender to us." The leaders of the seven revolutionary organizations said, when China's Khrushchev's agents in Wuhan implemented a long-term white terror, fiercely suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries, it was precisely by following Chairman Mao's teaching that, in the most difficult days, we breathed together, shared hardships, encouraged each other, supported each other, and fought together in unity, defeating the seemingly powerful class enemy and thus achieving victory. Our unity and friendship are forged in blood, which is the foundation for further achieving and consolidating great unity and great alliance, and an important guarantee for thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.

	In the revolutionary great criticism, achieve and consolidate great unity and great alliance

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All Communists must know: only by fighting to the end can we achieve unity to the end, and only by achieving unity to the end can we fight to the end."

	In the long practice of repeated class struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan have forged deep hatred against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. Especially recently, a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Wuhan Party have created a serious political incident in Wuhan, making the Wuhan proletarian revolutionaries even more enraged. They unanimously expressed that at present, we must hold high the banner of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle, and in the revolutionary great criticism, promote even broader great unity, with an even stronger iron fist to fiercely strike down the "drowning dogs."

	The leaders of "New Lake University" and "New Hua Farmers" said, we must hold high the banner of revolutionary great criticism and push the great criticism to a new stage. We must use great criticism to educate the masses, win over the masses, and unite the masses, achieving and consolidating revolutionary great unity in the struggle, seeking unity in the struggle against the enemy, and uniting to fight against the enemy; we must thoroughly expose, criticize, and struggle against the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan; we must thoroughly expose, criticize, and struggle against the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" and "Public Prosecution and Law Enforcement" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. We must launch a new upsurge of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle, mobilizing the broad masses to the greatest extent, jointly fighting against the enemy.

	The leaders of "Steel Second Command" and "Steel September 13" said, only through revolutionary great criticism can we achieve and consolidate a broader revolutionary great alliance. The proletarian revolutionaries must unite closely in the revolutionary great criticism, and the revolutionary masses and the PLA must unite closely, forming an even stronger iron fist, concentrating all our hatred on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. Only in this way can we liberate a large area, isolate a small handful to the greatest extent, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders, thoroughly defeating them and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev.

	The leaders of "New Hua Workers" and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance" also repeatedly emphasized that only by holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism can the revolutionary masses truly unite, and only by uniting can we carry out a deeper and more thorough great criticism. The leader of "Steel General" said, we should better mobilize, organize, unite, and unite against the enemy, organizing a surging proletarian Cultural Revolution army, forming an even more solid copper wall and iron wall, defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, defending the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, and resolutely carrying the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	Hold high the banner of "break private and establish public" to consolidate and develop great unity and great alliance

	Our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." The comrades participating in the discussion unanimously agreed that in the course of the struggle, there are various disagreements and contradictions between the revolutionary mass organizations, which are normal phenomena and nothing to be surprised about. The fundamental way to solve these disagreements and contradictions is to constantly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of "break private and establish public," fiercely fight against selfishness, and greatly establish public spirit, and do more self-criticism.

	The leaders of "Steel General" and "Steel September 13" said: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. It is inevitable and normal for revolutionary organizations to have disagreements on certain issues, and there is no need to be overly concerned. We can completely seek common ground while reserving differences under the premise of a unified direction, exchange views through appropriate opportunities. We have many shortcomings and hope that brother organizations will criticize us more. We are also prepared to invite the leaders of various revolutionary organizations to exchange views and listen to criticisms of us to achieve the goal of strengthening unity. We ourselves must also do more self-criticism and always maintain a humble and cautious style. In the internal affairs of the revolutionary organization, past matters should be left in the past, and old accounts should not be settled. All hatred should be concentrated on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. For them, new accounts should be settled, old accounts should also be settled, and a total account should be settled, thoroughly and satisfactorily.

	The leaders of "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," and "New Hua Farmers" said, among countless contradictions, the contradiction with China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan is the greatest contradiction. We should regard this enemy contradiction as a big one and regard the contradictions within the revolutionary organizations as small ones. We should be ruthless to the class enemy and kind to our comrades. The problems existing within the revolutionary organizations can be resolved through mutual consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual compromise, and in trivial matters, a little compromise can be made. The stronger we unite, the more fatal the blow to the class enemy. We students should learn from the workers and learn from the brother organizations, do more self-criticism. In the past, we also had many shortcomings and mistakes in our forward journey, and we hope that the brother organizations will criticize and help us. In the future, we will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, see more of others' strengths and more of our own weaknesses, launch a fierce attack on the "selfishness," and revolutionize it to the end. We must not only rebel to the end against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but also rebel to the end against the "selfishness" in our minds.

	The leaders of "Steel Second Command" and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance" said, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, is the fundamental way for the proletarian revolutionaries to further achieve and consolidate the development of great unity and great alliance. Chairman Mao's instructions, whether understood or not, must be executed. We must hold high the banner of revolutionary great alliance and be models of great alliance. We must not say anything that is not conducive to unity, do anything that is not conducive to unity, or post any big-character posters that are not conducive to unity. We must strictly require ourselves, do more self-criticism, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions, making new contributions to promoting even broader revolutionary great alliance.

    坚决遵循毛主席和党中央的教导  绝不辜负广大革命群众的期望
    武汉各革命组织负责人带头推进大联合
    他们团聚一堂，亲切座谈，一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密地团结起来，集中火力，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把武汉地区文化大革命推向新阶段。
    新华社武汉十四日电　在亿万军民满怀战斗豪情热烈庆祝八届十一中全会召开一周年的日子里，在举国上下掀起彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的革命新高潮中，英勇保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的武汉“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”和“三司革联”等革命组织的负责人团聚一堂，进行了亲切的座谈。他们一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步紧密地团结起来，进一步巩固地联合起来，集中目标，集中火力，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个崭新的阶段。
    共同的革命目标要求我们大团结、大联合
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”参加座谈会的同志一致指出，在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的大好形势下，我们无产阶级革命派必须看到，敌人虽然在政治上孤立了，但他们是不会甘心自己的失败的。他们还会施出新的花招，策划新的阴谋，进行疯狂的抵抗。我们千万不要丧失革命警惕，掉以轻心，否则，就会吃大亏，上大当。历史赋予我们无产阶级革命派的光荣使命，就是要彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把混进党里、政府里、军队里的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统统揪出来，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、斗臭。共同的革命目标迫切要求我们更紧密地团结起来，联合起来；只有团结战斗，联合对敌，才能置阶级敌人于死地，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的完全胜利。
    “钢工总”和“新华农”负责人说：中国的赫鲁晓夫被揪出来了，他在武汉地区的代理人也被揪出来了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的最伟大的胜利，最辉煌的成果。但是，必须看到，他们是没有冻僵的毒蛇，是落水的恶狗，还会作垂死的挣扎。阶级斗争的实践告诉我们，当敌人处于不利地位的时候，总是要采用分化革命阵线内部的手段。我们必须高度警惕。当前，摆在我们面前的战斗任务还很艰巨，斗争的道路还很长。我们应该更好地团结起来，联合起来，一致对敌，穷追猛打中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人和“百万雄师”、“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头。这是时代向我们提出的要求，也是广大革命群众的共同呼声。
    “新湖大”负责人说：当前武汉地区的革命形势，迫不及待地需要我们无产阶级革命派实现最广泛的革命大联合。一年多来的阶级斗争教育了我们，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人，虽然已经威风扫地，但他们决不会甘心于自己的失败。他们还会梳妆打扮，寻找机会向我们进攻。大敌当前，一切革命组织，必须进一步巩固地团结起来，联合起来，狠狠地打击敌人。
    “钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”和“三司革联”的负责人说：武汉地区无产阶级革命派更好地团结起来，这是毛主席和党中央对我们的殷切希望，也是全国人民对我们的要求。我们没有理由不更好地团结起来，联合起来，对付共同的敌人。敌人最害怕我们革命派的大团结，我们越是要加倍增强团结。毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们要永远牢记这个真理，要提高警惕，防止敌人的破坏和挑动。我们无产阶级革命派一定要迈开更大的步伐，挑起更重的担子，团结武汉地区广大的革命群众，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向资产阶级司令部猛烈开火。
    毛主席教导我们：“团结一致，同心同德，任何强大的敌人，任何困难的环境，都会向我们投降的。”七个革命组织的负责人说，当中国的赫鲁晓夫在武汉地区的代理人实行长时间白色恐怖，疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派的时候，正是遵循了毛主席的这一教导，在最艰苦的日子里，我们同呼吸，共患难，互相鼓舞，互相支持，坚持团结战斗，战胜了貌似强大的阶级敌人，因而赢得了胜利。我们的团结和友谊是用鲜血凝成的，这是进一步实现和巩固大联合、大团结的基础，也是彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的重要保证。
    在革命的大批判中实现和巩固大团结、大联合
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切共产党员须知：只有抗战到底，才能团结到底，也只有团结到底，才能抗战到底。”
    在长期阶级斗争反复较量的实践中，武汉无产阶级革命派凝聚了对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的深仇大恨。特别是最近，武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在武汉制造了严重的政治事件，使武汉的无产阶级革命派仇上加仇，恨上加恨。他们一致表示，目前必须更高地举起革命的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的大旗，在革命的大批判中促进更加广泛的大联合，以更加坚强的铁拳头狠狠地痛击“落水狗”。
    “新湖大”和“新华农”的负责人说，我们一定要高举革命大批判的旗帜，把大批判推向一个新阶段。我们要通过大批判来教育群众，争取群众，团结群众，在斗争中实现和巩固革命的大联合，在对敌斗争中求团结，团结起来对敌进行斗争；要把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人，批深批透批臭；要彻底揭发、批判、斗争“百万雄师”和“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头的罪行。我们要掀起大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，把广大群众最大限度地调动起来，共同对敌。
    “钢二司”和“钢九·一三”的负责人说，只有通过革命的大批判，才能实现和巩固更广泛的革命大联合。无产阶级革命派要在革命的大批判中，紧紧地团结在一起，革命派和解放军紧紧地团结在一起，结成更加坚强的铁拳，把千仇万恨集中在中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人身上。只有这样，才能做到解放一大片，最大限度地孤立一小撮，向一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，彻底打倒他们，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
    “新华工”和“三司革联”的负责人也都一再强调，只有高举革命的批判大旗，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，革命派才能真正的团结起来，才能争取和团结绝大多数的群众。只有联合起来，才能更深入更彻底地进行大批判。“钢工总”负责人说，我们应当更好地动员起来，组织起来，联合起来，团结起来，共同对敌，组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化大革命大军，结成更加巩固的铜墙铁壁，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，保卫武汉的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    高举“破私立公”的大旗  巩固和发展大团结、大联合
    我们伟大统帅毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”参加座谈会的同志一致认为，在战斗的道路上，各革命群众组织之间存在这样那样的分歧，出现这样那样的矛盾，是正常的现象，不足为奇的。解决这些分歧和矛盾的根本途径，是不断地活学活用毛主席著作，高举“破私立公”的大旗，狠斗私字，大立公字，多做自我批评。
    “钢工总”和“钢九·一三”的负责人说：我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。革命组织之间在某些问题上有分歧是难免的，是正常的现象，用不着大惊小怪。我们完全能够在大方向一致的前提下，求大同，存小异，通过适当的机会，交换意见。我们有许多缺点，希望各兄弟组织多给我们批评。我们还准备邀请各革命组织的负责人在一起交换意见，听取对我们的批评，达到加强团结的目的。我们自己更是要多做自我批评，时刻保持谦虚谨慎的作风。在革命组织内部，过去的事情就过去了，不要算老账。千仇万恨，统统集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人身上。对他们，新账要算，老账也要算，要算总账，算个彻底，算个痛快。
    “新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”的负责人说，千条矛盾，万条矛盾，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的矛盾，是最大的矛盾。我们应该把这个敌我矛盾看得大大的，把革命组织内部的矛盾看得小小的。对阶级敌人要狠，对自己的同志要和。革命组织内部存在的问题，可以互相协商，互相谅解，互相让步，在枝节问题上可以和点稀泥。我们团结得更坚强了，就是对阶级敌人的致命打击。我们学生要向工人学习，向各兄弟组织学习，要多做自我批评。过去，我们在前进的道路上也有不少缺点错误，希望各兄弟组织批评帮助。今后，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，多看别人的长处，多看自己的短处，向“私”字猛烈开火，一反到底。我们不仅要对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派造反到底，同时要对自己头脑里“私”字造反到底。
    “钢二司”和“三司革联”的负责人说，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，树立毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，是无产阶级革命派进一步实现和巩固发展大团结、大联合的根本。毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行。我们一定要高举革命大联合的旗帜，做大联合的模范。凡是不利于团结的话不说，不利于团结的事不做，不利于团结的大字报不贴。我们要严格要求自己，多做自我批评，用毛泽东思想来指导我们的一切行动，为促进更加广泛的革命大联合作出新的贡献。
