The great deeds performed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was created and led by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, are renowned worldwide. Since its inception, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been established according to Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the army and has grown and flourished under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought. It is an invincible, peerless, and great revolutionary army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has countless martyrs who are selfless and fearless. They have sacrificed their lives without hesitation for the people's interests and the cause of revolution.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a vivid embodiment of Chairman Mao's thoughts on building a people's army and a shining example of his thoughts on people's war.

Currently, in Latin America, the armed struggle of the revolutionary people is developing. The revolutionary people of some countries are striving to build a people's army. In this people's war, we have achieved many victories, but we have also suffered some setbacks, some of which are serious. The causes are multifaceted. However, the main errors lie in guiding the people's war and building the people's army. Therefore, we must learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao. We must learn from Mao Zedong Thought, which is Marxism-Leninism raised to a new level. Learning Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and building a people's army is a duty for all true revolutionaries in Latin America at present.

First, we must resolutely expose the false propaganda of the modern revisionists in Latin America who advocate the "peaceful road." They are merely the spokesmen of the Soviet revisionist leadership in Latin America. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to severely refute these fallacies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad."

However, the modern revisionists have concocted a "new theory" for their increasingly unsalable goods. They claim that achieving the "peaceful road" in Latin America is possible. The purpose of these revisionists is to deceive the masses and attempt to make it difficult for the revolutionary people to understand the necessity of building their own army, led by the proletariat through its party, and allied with other laborers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "From the viewpoint of Marxist-Leninist state theory, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a strong army. Some people laugh at us for being 'militarists,' but we are militarists of revolutionary war. This is not bad; it is good, it is Marxist. The Russian Communist Party's gun created a socialist society. We want to create a democratic republic. The experience of class struggle in the imperialist era tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed by the gun." Chairman Mao summarized this as a phrase increasingly recognized by more people in Latin America: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The people of Latin America have not been fooled by a handful of revisionist traitors and are igniting the flames of revolution across the Latin American continent. Those who oppose the advancing revolution are merely a few buzzing flies hitting the wall and will be burned by the flames of revolution.

We face difficulties. The first difficulty is how to build armed forces in places where armed struggle has not yet begun, and for places where the struggle has already developed, it is how to gradually turn the existing armed forces into a powerful people's army. This can only be solved in the struggle to destroy the enemy and strengthen ourselves. We must correctly lead our guerrilla warfare because serious errors will result in incalculable losses.

What are "serious errors" for us? This is deviating from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. As in the history of the Chinese revolution, we have seen how a small armed force has developed and grown into one of the strongest armies in the world. During the period when the "left" and "right" opportunist lines dominated, errors were made by deviating from Mao Zedong Thought, and setbacks were suffered. We must always learn from this painful lesson, bought with blood and life, and we must not repeat past mistakes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." We must overcome the erroneous view that the people are waiting for us to liberate them. The role of the masses in the people's war is directly linked to Chairman Mao's theory of establishing base areas. We must thoroughly eradicate the thought of banditry, which was deeply criticized by Chairman Mao thirty years ago, across the Latin American continent. We should learn from the Worker-Peasant Red Army created and led by Chairman Mao, establish revolutionary base areas, achieve the encirclement of cities from the countryside, and learn from the experience of the people's war practiced by the People's Liberation Army. The method of learning these experiences is to concentrate on studying Chairman Mao's works, which have risen from practical experience to scientific theory. We must clarify the nature of the people's war and the strategies and tactics formulated by Chairman Mao.

In addition to the errors we have made in leading the war, we have also made some errors in building the people's army. Chairman Mao teaches us what the nature of the people's army is and what distinguishes the people's army from other bourgeois or feudal armies. That is, this army is completely and thoroughly serving the people, serving the people wholeheartedly. Chairman Mao tells us: "The strength of this army lies in the fact that all those who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they are not fighting for the interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and the interests of the whole nation. Standing firmly with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." This means that everyone who joins the revolutionary ranks must raise their political consciousness and establish the absolute authority of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in their minds. The task of building a people's army is first and foremost a political task, not a technical one. Vice Chairman Lin Biao says: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought." We must strengthen this ideological education in our ranks to ensure that every soldier establishes the absolute authority of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in their minds. Why have heroes like Zhang Side, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie emerged in the People's Liberation Army? It is because they have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and are selfless and dedicated to others.

We must also correctly understand the relationship between the people's army and the revolutionary party. Currently, some absurd and bizarre arguments have appeared in Latin America, such as "the army builds the party," etc. We must clarify that it is the party that establishes the army, although this army can help the development of the party's organization. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and we absolutely do not allow the gun to command the party." If the revolutionary party does not guarantee its leadership over the army to ensure that this army consciously executes the policies of the proletariat, then this army will consciously or unconsciously execute the policies of the bourgeoisie and change its nature.

What is the task of the people's army? There are also problems here. Some people think that the function of the army is to fight and annihilate the enemy, thus reducing the work of the army to merely military struggle. How can a people's war be waged in this way? Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that performs revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just fighting; in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also bears the heavy tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party. The Red Army's fighting is not just for the sake of fighting, but for the sake of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses to build revolutionary political power. Without these goals, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its meaning." Chairman Mao also said: "We have an army that fights, and we have an army that labors. The army that fights, we have the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army; this army must also be used in two ways, on the one hand fighting, on the other hand producing. We have these two armies, our army has these two skills, plus the skill of doing mass work, then we can overcome difficulties and defeat Japanese imperialism." This means that the people's army, in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy, must also do a lot of mass work and engage in some self-sufficient production. We must remember the difficult years from 1942 to 1943, when the People's Liberation Army, in addition to fighting bravely and mobilizing the masses, responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China and actively participated in the great production movement.

Another point that must be paid attention to is unity within the army and unity between the army and the people. Within the People's Liberation Army, the relationship between cadres and soldiers is one of comrades; they have different duties but complete the same tasks together. In the People's Liberation Army, there are different but necessary divisions of labor, and everyone serves the revolution. In fact, this is an army that has been proletarianized in thought. They are equal politically and practice military, economic, and political democracy within the army, which is one of Chairman Mao's many contributions to building a people's army. In the early days of the People's Liberation Army, the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention formulated by Chairman Mao were a guarantee of revolutionary victory. With unity within the army and unity between the army and the people, the People's Liberation Army has a close relationship with the masses, and they have formed an indivisible whole. Chairman Mao said that the relationship between the army and the people should be like fish and water. Never leaving the masses is the fundamental teaching of the Chinese revolution.

Today, the Chinese people are engaged in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the People's Liberation Army is responsible for defending the motherland and resolutely opposing the provocations and threats of imperialist invaders. Socialist China is increasingly developing its national defense forces, and now, with the explosions of atomic bombs, missiles, and the recent hydrogen bomb, it has shocked the world. Revolutionary people look to Beijing—the center of world revolution. The people of the world understand that imperialism, in order to implement its plan to contain, encircle, and invade China, will suffer a shameful failure in its policy of aggression and war. The People's Liberation Army of China not only bears the responsibility of defending socialist China but is also a strong backbone for the revolutionary people of the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of manpower and morale. Military and economic strength must be grasped by people." The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese People's Liberation Army with high political consciousness and superb military technology are a reliable pillar for the revolutionary people of the world.

China is now carrying out an unprecedented Cultural Revolution, smashing the old and establishing the new. A handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are being criticized, denounced, and overthrown, and the whole country is in a state of fervor. In this revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary people have risen up and are uprooting the poisonous roots of revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped and applied by the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. In the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, the People's Liberation Army has actively undertaken the glorious and arduous tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and has established new merits. Now, we can be sure that China will not change color. The red light in the Kremlin has gone out, but the red light on Tiananmen will shine forever.

We, the revolutionaries of Latin America, must learn from the People's Liberation Army of China. We will take the People's Liberation Army of China as an example to correct our mistakes, overcome our shortcomings, and strengthen our fighting forces. We will study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we advance the national liberation wars in various countries.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war and building a people's army have been proven correct by the past Chinese revolution. Now, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they are also completely correct. With a people's army armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the people of various countries will have a reliable support to gain liberation. As the reddest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

Learn from the army created by the greatest leader Chairman Mao and strive for the victory of the Latin American revolution!

    向毛泽东主席亲自缔造的军队学习
    拉丁美洲　安东尼奥·罗德里格斯
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军所创立的丰功伟绩是举世闻名的。中国人民解放军从诞生以来，一直是按照毛主席的无产阶级建军路线建立起来的，是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长壮大的。这是一支战无不胜的举世无双的伟大的革命军队。中国人民解放军有无数的先烈，他们是无私而又无畏的人们，他们为了人民的利益，为了革命的事业，毫不犹豫地献出了自己的生命。
    中国人民解放军是毛泽东主席关于建立人民军队思想的生动体现，她的斗争历史是毛泽东主席有关人民战争思想的光辉榜样。
    目前，在拉丁美洲，革命人民的武装斗争正在发展，一些国家的革命人民正在致力于建立一支人民的军队。在这场人民战争中，我们已经取得了不少胜利，但同时也遭到了某些挫折，必须指出，其中有一些是严重的挫折，原因是多方面的。但主要的错误则在于指导人民战争和建立人民军队方面。为此，我们必须向毛主席缔造的中国人民解放军学习。向毛泽东思想——提高到新阶段的马克思列宁主义学习。学习毛主席有关人民战争和建设人民军队的思想是当前拉丁美洲所有真正的革命者的一个职责。
    首先，我们应当坚决揭露拉丁美洲现代修正主义者所大力宣传的“和平道路”的虚伪的说法。他们只不过是苏修领导集团在拉美的代言人。我们一定要用毛泽东思想严厉地驳斥这些谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    但是，现代修正主义者为自己越来越无法推销的货色编造了“新的理论”。他们说什么，在拉丁美洲实现“和平道路”是可能的。这些修正主义者的目的就在于迷惑群众，妄图使革命人民难于了解建立一支自己的、由无产阶级通过他的政党领导的，和其他劳动者结成联盟的人民军队的必要性。
    毛主席教导我们说：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。有人笑我们是‘战争万能论’，对，我们是革命战争万能论者，这不是坏的，是好的，是马克思主义的。俄国共产党的枪杆子造了一个社会主义。我们要造一个民主共和国。帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”毛主席把这概括为在拉美越来越多的人所认识到的一句话：“枪杆子里面出政权”。拉美人民没有上一小撮修正主义叛徒的当，正在点燃起拉美大陆革命的熊熊烈火。那些反对正在胜利前进的革命的人，只不过是几只嗡嗡叫的碰壁苍蝇，将为革命的熊熊烈火所烧死。
    我们是有困难的。首先一个困难，就是对还没有开展武装斗争的地方，如何建立武装力量，而对于斗争已经比较发展的地方，就是如何逐步地把现有的武装力量发展为一支强大的人民军队。这只有在消灭敌人壮大自己的斗争中才能解决的。我们一定要正确地领导我们的游击战，因为严重的错误将造成难以估量的损失。
    对我们说来，什么是“严重的错误”呢？这就是离开毛泽东思想的指导。正如在中国革命历史上，我们也看到，一支小小的武装力量是如何发展壮大成为一支世界上最强大的军队的。在“左”右倾机会主义路线统治时期，由于离开了毛泽东思想，犯了错误，遭受过挫折。我们应该时刻吸取这一用鲜血和生命换来的痛苦的教训，我们不应该再重犯过去的错误。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们必须克服那种认为人民群众等着我们去解放的错误观点。群众在人民战争中的作用直接地同毛主席有关建立根据地的理论联系在一起。我们必须在拉丁美洲大陆彻底地铲除早在三十年前就被毛主席深刻地批判过的流寇主义思想。我们应该学习为毛主席缔造和领导的工农红军，建立革命根据地，实现农村包围城市，以及人民解放军所实践的中国人民战争的经验。学习这些经验的方法就是要集中学习从实践经验上升为科学理论的毛主席著作。我们必须明确人民战争的性质和毛主席所制定的战略战术。
    我们除了在领导战争方面所犯的错误外，还在建设人民军队方面犯了一些错误。毛主席教导我们，什么是人民军队的性质，什么是区别于人民军队同其他资产阶级或封建的军队的东西。那就是，这支军队是完全、彻底地为人民服务的，是全心全意地为人民服务的。毛主席告诉我们：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”这就是说，所有参加革命队伍的人都要提高政治觉悟，要在自己头脑里大树无产阶级思想。建立人民军队的任务首先是一个政治任务，而不是技术任务。林彪副主席说：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人”。在我们的队伍里必须加强这一思想教育，以便使每个战士在头脑里树立马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的绝对权威。为什么在人民解放军中能够涌现出象张思德、董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰等等英雄人物？是因为他们用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，毫不利己，专门利人。
    我们还必须正确认识人民军队和革命党之间的关系。目前，在拉美出现了一些荒唐而离奇的论调，说什么“由军队来建党”等等。我们必须明确，是党来创立军队，虽然这一军队可以帮助党组织的发展。毛主席教导说：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党。”如果革命党不保证她对军队的领导，以便使这支军队自觉地执行无产阶级的政策，那么，这支军队就将自觉不自觉地执行资产阶级的政策，并将改变它的性质。
    什么是人民军队的任务呢？这里也存在一些问题，有人认为，军队的职能是打仗，消灭敌人，这样便把军队的工作范围归结为只是军事斗争，这样怎么能进行一场人民战争呢？毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的。离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”毛主席还说：“我们有打仗的军队，又有劳动的军队。打仗的军队，我们有八路军新四军；这支军队也要当两支用，一方面打仗，一方面生产。我们有了这两支军队，我们的军队有了这两套本领，再加上做群众工作一项本领，那末，我们就可以克服困难，把日本帝国主义打垮。”这就是说，人民军队除了要打仗消灭敌人，同时要做大量的群众工作，还要从事部分自给的生产。我们必须记住一九四二到一九四三年困难的年代，当时人民解放军除了英勇地打仗，放手发动群众外，响应了毛主席和中国共产党的号召，积极地参加大生产运动。
    另一点必须引起我们重视的是军队内部一致和军民一致。在人民解放军内部，干部和战士的关系是同志的关系，他们职务不同，但共同完成任务。在人民解放军中有不同的、但必要的分工，人人都为革命服务。实际上，这是一支思想上无产阶级化了的军队。他们在政治上是平等的，在军队内部实行军事、经济和政治三大民主，这是毛主席对建设一支人民军队的任务的许多贡献之一。人民解放军建立初期，毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意是革命胜利的一个保证。有了军队内部的一致，有了军民的一致，人民解放军同群众的关系是亲密的，他们共同结成了一个不可分割的整体。毛主席说，军民关系应该是鱼和水的关系。永远不脱离群众，这是中国革命的根本教导。
    今天，中国人民正在从事社会主义革命和社会主义建设，人民解放军担负着保卫祖国，坚决反对帝国主义侵略者的挑衅和威胁的职责。社会主义中国正在日益发展着自己的国防力量，现在，又以原子弹几次爆炸，导弹和最近的氢弹的爆炸震惊了全世界。革命人民心向北京——世界革命的中心。世界人民懂得帝国主义为了实施它遏制、包围中国以便侵略中国的计划而推行的侵略和战争政策，必将遭到可耻的破产。中国人民解放军不仅担负着保卫社会主义中国的职责，也是世界革命人民的坚强后盾。
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和具有高度政治觉悟、高超军事技术的中国人民解放军是世界革命人民的可靠支柱。
    中国现在正在进行一场史无前例的文化大革命，大破四旧，大立四新。中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派正在被批倒、批臭、批垮，全国上下一片热气腾腾。在这场革命中，广大革命群众起来了，他们正在拔掉修正主义的毒根。毛泽东思想正在被广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子掌握和运用。在伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军积极担负了支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣而又艰巨的任务，建立了新的功勋。现在，我们可以确信，中国将不会改变颜色，克里姆林宫的红灯熄灭了，但天安门上的红灯将永放光辉。
    我们，拉丁美洲的革命者要向中国人民解放军学习，我们以中国人民解放军为榜样改正我们的错误，克服我们的缺点，加强我们的战斗力量，活学活用毛泽东思想。我相信，只有这样，我们才能够在各国把民族解放战争推向前进。
    毛主席关于人民战争和建设人民军队的光辉思想已经为过去中国革命证明是正确的。现在，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲证明也是完全正确的。有了一支用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，各国人民获得解放就有了依靠。正如世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席所指出的：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    向最伟大领袖毛主席缔造的军队学习，争取拉丁美洲革命的胜利！
