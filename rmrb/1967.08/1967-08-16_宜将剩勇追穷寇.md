Today, the entire nation is engaged in a revolutionary criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. At this time, it is of great significance to publicly release the resolution of the Lushan Conference regarding the anti-Party clique headed by Peng Dehuai.

Eight years ago, at the Party's Lushan Conference, a heart-rending class struggle unfolded, exposing the anti-Party clique headed by Peng Dehuai, the chief representative of the capitalist-roaders within the military. This clique was attempting to usurp the Party and the military, aiming to achieve a capitalist restoration. After the Lushan Conference, the Party Central Committee decided that Comrade Lin Biao, who holds the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, should take charge of the Central Military Commission. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line.

Peng Dehuai, this bourgeois element who infiltrated the Party, this great schemer and conspirator, has always opposed Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. During the second domestic revolutionary war, he was a supporter and follower of the "Left" adventurist Li Lisan line and the Wang Ming line. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he actively promoted Wang Ming's right-opportunist line. After the founding of the nation, he consistently held a bourgeois reactionary stance, siding with the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, opposing socialist transformation, opposing the socialist revolution, undermining the dictatorship of the proletariat, and engaging in splitist activities within the Party. He was actually the leader of the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance. He fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's military line, actively promoting the bourgeois, revisionist military line. He opposed studying Chairman Mao's works, downgrading and weakening political and ideological work. He resisted Chairman Mao's people's war strategy, opposing the mobilization of the entire population. In 1959, just as our socialist revolution was deepening, the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement were achieving great victories, and imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries were extremely panicked, launching a joint attack against us, Peng Dehuai, with the support of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique, could not wait to jump out, rallying a small group of anti-Party elements at the Lushan Conference to throw out an anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought manifesto. He attacked the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, calling for a change in the Party's line. His set of revisionist proposals was completely in line with those of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The struggle at the Lushan Conference was a fierce clash between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, a serious confrontation between the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois headquarters that had long been hidden within the Party. Peng Dehuai and his gang held important leadership positions in the military, posing a great danger. The biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party had placed a large bet on them. Therefore, the Party's victory in this struggle was a heavy blow to the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

At the Lushan Conference, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle that has emerged at Lushan is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two opposing classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie during the past ten years of socialist revolution in China. In our Party, this kind of struggle will continue, at least for another twenty years, possibly half a century. In short, the struggle will not stop until the class is completely annihilated."

The facts revealed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully prove the correctness of this profound judgment by our great leader Chairman Mao.

This "fallen dog," Peng Dehuai, will never change his nature. All his promises of "correcting mistakes" and "not reversing the verdict" are lies. In the eight years since the Lushan Conference, he has never stopped his anti-Party activities. In 1962, when the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in response to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism with the "reversal of verdicts wind," the "individual farming wind," and the "three reductions and one annihilation," Peng Dehuai threw out an 80,000-word book of reversal, fiercely counterattacking. Peng Dehuai's series of anti-Party activities were actively supported by the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and closely coordinated with their counter-revolutionary restoration plots. The biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party openly created public opinion for Peng Dehuai's reversal, attempting to bring him back to power. These counter-revolutionary revisionists, in collusion, were in cahoots, wearing the same pants. Isn't this clear?

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, launched a general offensive against the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses brandished the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, roaring like thunder, sweeping all obstacles, and exposing the true colors of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party one by one. Their doom has arrived. The proletariat has achieved unprecedented great victories.

However, the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party will not voluntarily retreat from the historical stage. "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are annihilated"—they will not deviate from this logic.

Now, they have become "fallen dogs," but they can still crawl back to shore and bite at any time. They are paper tigers, but not dead tigers. "It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and one should not seek fame by imitating Xiang Yu." We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, verbally and in writing, fiercely attack the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their representatives within the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan! Politically, ideologically, and theoretically, we must criticize them deeply, thoroughly, and completely, eliminating all their poisonous influences, so that they can never rise again!

    宜将剩勇追穷寇
    今天，全国正在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。在这个时候，公开发表庐山会议关于以彭德怀为首的反党集团的决议，有着重大的意义。
    八年前，在党的庐山会议上，展开了一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，揭露了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在军内的代理人彭德怀为首的反党集团，粉碎了他们篡军篡党，妄图实现资本主义复辟的大阴谋。庐山会议之后，党中央决定由毛泽东思想红旗举得最高的林彪同志主持中央军委工作。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    彭德怀，这个混进党内的资产阶级分子，这个大野心家、大阴谋家，从来就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。在第二次国内革命战争中，他是“左”倾冒险主义的立三路线和王明路线的支持者和追随者。抗日战争中，他积极推行王明的右倾机会主义路线。建国以后，他一直坚持资产阶级反动立场，站在以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线一边，反对社会主义改造，反对社会主义革命，破坏无产阶级专政，在党内进行分裂活动。他实际上是高饶反党联盟的头头。他猖狂反对毛主席的军事路线，积极推行资产阶级、修正主义的军事路线。他反对学习毛主席著作，贬低和削弱政治思想工作。他抗拒毛主席人民战争思想，反对全民皆兵。一九五九年，正当我国社会主义革命日益深入，党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动取得伟大胜利，帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派极端恐慌，联合起来对我们进行疯狂攻击的时候，彭德怀在苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团支持下，迫不及待地跳了出来，纠集了一小撮反党分子，在庐山会议上抛出一个反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的纲领，攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社，叫嚷要改变党的路线。他的一套修正主义主张同中国赫鲁晓夫是完全一致的。
    庐山会议上的这场斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的一次激烈搏斗，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部同长期隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部之间的一次严重较量。彭德怀及其一伙窃踞着军队的一些重要领导职位，具有极大的危险性。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派把很大一笔赌注押在他们身上。因此，党在这场斗争中的胜利，是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的沉重打击。
    在庐山会议上，毛主席曾经指出：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，至少还要斗二十年，可能要斗半个世纪，总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息。”
    无产阶级文化大革命揭发出来的大量事实，充分证明我们伟大领袖毛主席这个论断的英明正确。
    彭德怀这条“落水狗”，绝不会改变它的本性。什么“改正错误”的保证，什么“不会翻案”的诺言，统统都是鬼话。庐山会议以后的八年来，他一直没有停止过反党活动。一九六二年，正当党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，大刮“翻案风”、“单干风”，大搞“三自一包”、“三降一灭”，向党、向社会主义发动猖狂进攻的时候，彭德怀抛出了长达八万言的翻案书，疯狂地进行反攻倒算。彭德怀这一系列的反党活动，是得到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派积极支持的，是同他们的反革命复辟阴谋密切配合的。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派公开为彭德怀的翻案制造舆论，企图让他重新上台。这些反革命修正主义分子，串通一气，狼狈为奸，穿的是一条连裆裤，这难道还不清楚吗？
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部展开了总攻击。亿万革命群众奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，叱咤风云，所向披靡，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一个个揪了出来，叫他们显出了原形。他们的末日到来了。无产阶级取得了空前的大胜利。
    但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不会自行退出历史舞台。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”，他们是不会违背这个逻辑的。
    现在，他们已经成了“落水狗”，但随时还会爬上岸来反口咬人。他们是纸老虎，但不是死老虎。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展革命的大批判，口诛笔伐，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿猛烈开火！从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透批倒批臭，彻底清除他们的一切流毒，一切影响，叫他们永世不得翻身！
                                            （八月十六日）
