It is not a matter of sequence, but a sharp struggle between two paths
— Exposing the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of mechanization before collectivization

The Chinese Khrushchev has long been engaged in a series of counter-revolutionary activities in the rural areas, spreading a large number of fallacies that obstruct and sabotage agricultural collectivization. The notion that mechanization must come before collectivization is one of his many fallacies. Using this as an excuse, he opposes the socialist transformation of agriculture and creates public opinion for the development of capitalism in the countryside.

Waiting for mechanization before collectivization will inevitably lead to the spread of capitalism

In 1949, Xiyang County in Shanxi Province successfully completed land reform. The question facing the broad masses of peasants was: Where should the countryside go? Should it take the socialist path or the capitalist path? This was a serious struggle between two classes and two paths.

One path is to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "organize together," through mutual aid teams and cooperatives, to achieve agricultural collectivization. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiyang County firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Only socialism can save China," "Without agricultural socialization, there can be no complete and consolidated socialism." They organized together, relying on collective strength, and displayed a spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, changing the backward face of agriculture. The famous Dazhai Brigade is a shining example of this broad path.

The other path is the one that the Chinese Khrushchev openly and covertly advocates: continuing to work individually, which is the capitalist path. The Chinese Khrushchev said: "Relying on mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and farm teams to implement agricultural collectivization and agricultural socialization is impossible. This is a utopian agricultural socialism, an erroneous idea.... Without industrialization, agricultural collectivization is fundamentally impossible." He even shouted: "About socialism, let's consider it later; it's too early to talk about it now." The Chinese Khrushchev spread this evil wind, and some wealthy peasants and cadres who stood on the side of the wealthy peasants also followed suit, saying: "The Nationalist reactionaries have been defeated, and land reform has been completed; we can take a break now. Cooperatives? We can't do it without machines; it's not even on the drawing board yet, it's still far away!" A few peasants, influenced by their reactionary fallacies, looked at the big mountains in front of their doors and the scattered plots of land, shook their heads and sighed, making up a ditty: "The mountains are high and block the sun, even if a tractor comes, it can't turn around, there's no hope for socialism."

Chairman Mao taught us: "If socialism does not occupy the rural front, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiyang County firmly took the path of mutual aid and cooperation, presenting a prosperous scene. However, a few peasants, poisoned by the reactionary fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, led by a small group of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist path, engaged in capitalist activities. They said: "Without machines, organizing together is useless," "Agricultural collectivization is good, but it's like distant water that can't quench immediate thirst," "To get rich, farm and open a shop." They had mutual aid teams in name, but in reality, they each did their own thing. In one village with 210 households, more than 60 households abandoned farming to engage in commerce and speculation. As a result, just three years after the land reform, by 1952, this village showed clear signs of polarization. Twenty-three poor households were forced to sell the land and houses they had received during the land reform, while three wealthy households became rich peasants, hiring people to farm and drive carts for business. Such villages continued to suffer from natural disasters and man-made calamities similar to those of the old society. This was the direct result of the Chinese Khrushchev's opposition to agricultural collectivization and his policy of preserving the rich peasant economy for a long time. What he said about mechanization before collectivization, and that without industrialization, agricultural collectivization cannot be consolidated, was all nonsense. In essence, he wanted to block the peasants from taking the socialist path and open the door wide for the development of capitalism in the countryside, thus plunging the broad masses of peasants back into misery. The Chinese Khrushchev's intentions were indeed evil!

Mechanization before collectivization is to stifle the peasants' socialist enthusiasm

To carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, various conditions are needed. What is the most important condition? Among countless conditions, the human factor is the most fundamental. Chairman Mao taught us: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not evade problems but solve them actively, any human difficulty can be overcome." The great practice of the Chinese revolution and construction fully proves: as long as the minds of hundreds of millions of people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, no miracle that cannot be created. However, the Chinese Khrushchev used all kinds of conditions to scare the peasants; he set many rules for achieving agricultural collectivization, one of the most vicious of which was that agricultural collectivization could not be carried out before mechanization. In other words, it was to make the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, who actively demanded the socialist path, surrender in the face of temporary difficulties in the lack of agricultural machinery and give up the demand to achieve agricultural collectivization through mutual aid and cooperation. Can agricultural collectivization not be achieved before mechanization? The facts have already slapped the Chinese Khrushchev in the face.

To achieve agricultural collectivization, does it depend on people's socialist awareness or on machines? The Chinese Khrushchev insisted it was on machines. In his view, peasants were ignorant and uneducated. He had repeatedly maliciously slandered peasants, saying things like, "Due to peasants' long-term attachment to the land for scattered, independent, simple, self-sufficient, and mutually uncooperative production, and their simple, independent way of life, as well as their burden of rent and labor services, peasants have developed scattered, conservative, narrow-minded, and backward characteristics." He also said, "Peasants work in the hot sun, sweating like rain, not out of their own will, but out of compulsion. If they could stay at home to rest and sleep, they would be very willing." The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, has always ignored the revolutionary nature of our laboring peasants and has not seen the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist path after liberation. He believed that only with a large number of machines, leading the peasants by the nose with machines, could the peasants be forced to take the path of agricultural collectivization. It is not surprising that the Chinese Khrushchev looked down on peasants while valuing machines so much. Because, whether in the past or present, all capitalist factory owners and farm owners have always regarded workers and peasants as speaking machines. In reality, he regarded machines as more important than people; workers had to follow the machines, and workers were the appendages of machines.

In sharp contrast to the Chinese Khrushchev, our great leader Chairman Mao firmly believed in the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist path and believed that the party could lead the peasants to take the socialist path. During the process of agricultural cooperativization, Chairman Mao saw the spirit of communism flourishing throughout the country and happily pointed out: "In addition to the party's leadership, the six hundred million people are a decisive factor. The more people there are, the more discussions there are, the higher the enthusiasm, and the greater the effort." It was under the care and guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao that the broad masses of peasants in Xiyang County, in the process of achieving collectivization, were spirited, full of fighting spirit, and full of vigor, fully playing the role of the human factor, and achieving one victory after another. In terms of natural conditions, Xiyang County is one of the poorer ones in Shanxi, with "seven terraces, one ditch, and two flat areas." The natural conditions of Dazhai are even poorer within Xiyang County, with "seven ditches, eight ridges, and one slope." According to the "theory" of the Chinese Khrushchev, whether it was Xiyang County or the Dazhai Brigade, to wait for mechanization before achieving collectivization would only result in watching capitalism spread like a plague and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants continue to suffer. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiyang County, like the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the country, firmly remembered the teachings of our beloved leader Chairman Mao: "Our own destiny should be completely in our own hands." They greatly boosted revolutionary spirit and established socialist thinking. Comrade Chen Yonggui at the time firmly refuted the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of mechanization before collectivization, saying: "During the Anti-Japanese War, we used hand grenades and homemade landmines to defeat the Japanese devils with rifles and cannons; during the War of Liberation, we used corn and rifles to annihilate the eight million reactionary troops of the Kuomintang armed by the Americans. Now, why should we have machines before achieving agricultural collectivization for socialism? If we wait to have machines before doing socialism, everything will be delayed; the two hands that everyone has will also be useless!"

The facts completely prove that the most important preparatory work and condition for achieving agricultural collectivization is not machines but people, the revolutionization of people's thinking. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the broad masses of peasants actively took the path of mutual aid and cooperation. In the three great revolutionary movements, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raised their socialist awareness, cultivated the habits of collective production and collective life, and at the same time trained a large number of grassroots cadres with socialist awareness who could lead and manage the collective economy. Chairman Mao said: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." Socialist thinking, habits, and personnel preparation are incomparably more important for achieving agricultural collectivization than machines. It is precisely because of such conditions that, water to the channel, Xiyang County's rural areas, although the natural conditions are poor and machines have not been used, have, like the vast rural areas throughout the country, taken the bright path of agricultural collectivization on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation, and achieved people's communization.

Waiting for mechanization before achieving collectivization is an attempt to stop the development of productive forces

The Chinese Khrushchev kept shouting that mechanization must come before collectivization, as if he valued the development of productive forces. In fact, this was a pretext for him to attempt to stop the development of productive forces. After the completion of land reform in the countryside, the formerly landless and poor peasants obtained land, which was a liberation of productive forces. However, if we stop here and do not continue to transform the production relations, organizing the scattered peasants, further liberating the productive forces, there will be polarization, which will have a destructive effect on the productive forces and will not even talk about fully utilizing the potential of manpower and materials. Chairman Mao taught us: "Indeed, productive forces, practice, and the economic base generally manifest as the main and decisive role. Whoever does not admit this is not a materialist. However, under certain conditions, production relations, theory, and the superstructure also manifest as the main and decisive role, which must also be admitted. When production relations are not changed, productive forces cannot develop, the change of production relations plays the main and decisive role." The facts have proven that Chairman Mao's judgment is absolutely correct.

After the land reform, the peasants were still individual peasants, and they were greatly restricted in transforming the natural landscape, resisting natural disasters, and developing production. When we raised mutual aid teams to cooperatives, a fundamental change occurred. Things that a single household could not do, or even did not think of doing, were accomplished. After cooperativization, not only were flood control and drainage canals built, but larger-scale water conservancy projects such as sluices, gullies, terraces, and reservoirs were also successfully completed. As for the benefits of rationally utilizing labor, planting crops according to local conditions, and accumulating public wealth, they are countless. Chairman Mao said during the cooperativization high tide: "Socialism not only liberates the laborers and means of production from the old society but also liberates the vast natural world that the old society could not utilize. The masses have limitless creativity. They can organize and march to every place and department where they can exert their strength, march to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves." Chairman Mao's words are the most correct summary of the cooperativization movement's further liberation of productive forces and the highest evaluation and great encouragement for the five hundred million peasants to organize and take the socialist path.

The Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of mechanization before collectivization fundamentally denies the promoting role of changing production relations in the development of productive forces and denies the great significance of the conscious revolutionary activities of the masses in the development of production. From individual production to the realization of cooperativization, not only did the production relations undergo a qualitative change, but the peasants' thoughts also underwent a revolutionary leap. In short, they no longer regarded land as their lifeline but relied on labor for food; they no longer relied on heaven but on people; they no longer relied on individual economy but on collective economy. This change greatly promoted the development of production.

Throughout history, all exploiting classes, when in their declining period, feared the transformation of production relations the most, that is, they feared the oppressed people rising up to overthrow them, rebel against them, and touch their fundamental interests. Therefore, they always struggled desperately to prevent the transformation of production relations. The Chinese Khrushchev, the largest representative of the bourgeoisie within the party, did such a shameful deed. Every time the revolution rapidly developed, he would instinctively jump out and shout, saying things like, "Socialism is a future thing," "rushed ahead," "the people's communes were established too early."... Despite the buzzing of a few flies, the earth still rotates, and the socialist cause in China's countryside still develops rapidly. Agricultural cooperativization "is the roaring waves of the sea, sweeping away all monsters and ghosts. The faces of all kinds of people in society are clearly distinguished." The Chinese Khrushchev, who attempted to stop the transformation of production relations, that is, who did not want the revolution and opposed the revolution, naturally suffered a crushing defeat in the waves of the cooperativization movement.

Waiting for mechanization before collectivization is actually not wanting mechanization

We have always believed that actively developing industry, achieving national industrialization, and equipping agriculture with advanced technology are of great importance for transforming agriculture from small-scale operations to large-scale operations and further improving agricultural production levels. However, this has nothing in common with the Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense of mechanization before collectivization. The Chinese Khrushchev wanted the peasants to sit still, waiting for a gift, and only after having machines, would they achieve collectivization, actually attempting to make agriculture capitalist. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must not separate and isolate industrialization and agricultural transformation of socialism, nor can we emphasize one side and weaken the other." How can agriculture adopt advanced technology and achieve mechanization? Chairman Mao pointed out the correct path for us: "Cooperativization must come first, and then large machines can be used." This is because: first, agricultural machines do not come out of thin air. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. After achieving agricultural collectivization, the potential of manpower and materials is fully utilized, increasing grain and industrial raw materials, developing light industry, increasing state funds, and only then can heavy industry be developed, producing more and better agricultural machines. Taking Xiyang County as an example, in 1949, when the land reform had just ended, the annual grain production was only over six thousand tons. By 1953, after full organization, the annual grain production was over eight thousand tons, and that year, two thousand eight hundred tons of grain were sold to the state. By the late 1958 high-level cooperatives, the annual grain production was over one hundred million tons. The Dazhai Brigade, in the early days of liberation, had to eat two to three million tons of state grain per year. By 1953, after full organization, six million five thousand tons of grain were sold to the state; by 1958, an average of twenty-four million tons of grain were sold to the state per year, with each household selling an average of three thousand tons of surplus grain, exceeding the state's procurement task by two times. Secondly, even if there are agricultural machines, only after the peasants are organized, the land is connected, necessary agricultural land construction is carried out, production is developed, income is increased, and there is a certain amount of public accumulation, can machines be bought and used. Individual households scattered in production cannot use machines. Taking the promotion of new agricultural tools as an example, Xiyang County began to promote double-wheel double-share plows in 1953, and only cooperatives could buy and use them; mutual aid teams were powerless to use them, let alone individual farmers.

The Chinese Khrushchev used all kinds of vicious words to deny the necessity and superiority of cooperativization, saying things like, "Raising agricultural production mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives, using this new factor to 'overcome the spontaneous forces of the peasants.' This is an erroneous, dangerous, utopian agricultural socialist thought." Only his mechanization before collectivization is the "correct" thought. This is completely a reversal of right and wrong, confusing black and white.

After the land reform, if mutual aid teams and cooperatives are not actively organized, the peasants will return to the old path where a few people are rich and the majority are poor. The broad masses of laboring peasants cannot even fill their stomachs, let alone have socialist agricultural mechanization? The Chinese Khrushchev's frenzied opposition to agricultural collectivization fully exposed his face as the representative of landlords and rich peasants. How landlords and rich peasants hate, curse, and sabotage agricultural cooperativization, the Chinese Khrushchev did the same. The difference is: the former cursed and sabotaged in secret, while the latter cursed and sabotaged in public; the former was exposed in broad daylight, while the latter was hidden within the party and even held important positions. Of course, their fate is the same, both becoming piles of filth unworthy of human dignity.

    不是先后之争，是两条道路的尖锐斗争
    ——戳穿中国赫鲁晓夫提出先机械化后集体化谬论的罪恶阴谋
    张怀英
    中国的赫鲁晓夫长期以来在农村阵地上进行了一系列的反革命活动，散布了大量阻挠和破坏农业集体化的谬论。先实现机械化，然后才能实现农业集体化，就是他炮制的大量谬论中的一个。他以此为借口，反对农业的社会主义改造，为在农村中发展资本主义制造舆论。
    等机械化了再搞集体化  等来的必然是资本主义泛滥
    山西省昔阳县，在一九四九年胜利地完成了土地改革。摆在广大农民面前的问题是：农村向何处去？是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？这是两个阶级、两条道路的严重斗争。
    一条是按照毛主席“组织起来”的指示，经过互助组、合作社，实现农业集体化的道路。昔阳县的广大贫下中农牢记毛主席的教导：“只有社会主义能够救中国”，“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”他们组织起来，依靠集体力量，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，改变着农业的落后面貌。著名的大寨大队就是在这条宽广的大道上走得最快、也走得最好的一个榜样。
    另一条就是中国的赫鲁晓夫明里暗里提倡的继续单干下去的，也就是资本主义的道路。中国的赫鲁晓夫说：“依靠互助组、合作社、代耕队，实行农业集体化，实行农业社会主义化，这是不可能的。这是一种空想的农业社会主义，是错误的。……不实现工业化，农业根本不可能实现集体化。”“没有机器的集体农庄，是巩固不了的。”他甚至叫嚣：“关于社会主义，要将来再考虑，现在还提得太早了。”中国的赫鲁晓夫刮起了这股阴风，一部分富裕农民和站在富裕农民立场上的干部，也跟着说什么：“国民党反动派被打垮了，土地改革也完成了，可以歇一歇了。办农业合作社么，现在没机器办不了，八字没一撇，还远着哩！”有极少数农民听了他们的议论，看看自家门前横着的大山，想想七零八落的小片地，摇摇头、叹口气，编出了顺口溜：“山高遮日头，拖拉机来了也转不过头，社会主义没盼头。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”昔阳县绝大多数贫下中农坚定地走互助合作的道路，呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。但是，有极少数农民，在中国的赫鲁晓夫散布的反动谬论毒害下，由党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派带头，进行资本主义活动。他们说：“使不上机器，组织起来也白搭”，“农业集体化好，远水不解近渴”，“要想富，种地带开铺。”他们名义上也有互助组，但是实际上是各干各的。有一个村共二百一十户人家，有六十多户弃农经商、搞投机倒把活动。这样一来，土改结束后不过三年，到一九五二年，这个村就出现了明显的两极分化。有二十三户贫下中农，被迫卖掉了土改时分到的土地和房屋，有三户富裕中农变成了富农，他们雇人种地，雇人赶车跑买卖。这样的村庄，农业生产继续遭受着类似旧社会那样天灾人祸的破坏。这也就是中国的赫鲁晓夫反对农业集体化和推行长期保存富农经济政策产生的直接结果。什么先机械化然后才能集体化啦，没有工业化农业集体化不能巩固啦，……说穿了，就是妄想堵住农民走社会主义的道路，为在农村发展资本主义大开方便之门，从而使广大农民重新陷于水深火热之中。中国的赫鲁晓夫的用心何其毒也！
    先机械化后集体化就是要扼杀农民的社会主义积极性
    进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，需要各方面的条件。什么是最重要的条件呢？千条万条，人的因素是最根本的一条。毛主席教导我们说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”中国革命和建设的伟大实践充分证明：只要用毛泽东思想武装了亿万群众的头脑，就没有不可战胜的困难，没有不可创造出来的奇迹。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫硬是利用这种条件、那种条件，吓唬农民；他给实现农业集体化规定了许多清规戒律，其中极其恶毒的一条，就是没有实现机械化以前，不能搞农业集体化。换句话说，就是要积极要求走社会主义道路的广大贫下中农，在暂时缺少农业机器的困难面前屈服，放弃经过互助合作的道路实现农业集体化的要求。在实现机械化之前，真的不能实现农业集体化吗？事实早已打了中国的赫鲁晓夫的耳光。
    实现农业集体化，首先是靠人的社会主义觉悟？还是靠机器呢？中国的赫鲁晓夫一口咬定是靠机器。在他看来，农民都是愚昧无知的群氓。他曾不只一次地恶毒地诬蔑农民，说什么，“由于农民长期附着在土地上进行散漫的、独立的、简单的、自给的、彼此不大互相协作的生产，和他们简单的独立的生活样式，以及他们对于地租劳役的负担等，就养成农民的散漫性、保守性、狭隘性、落后性。”他还胡说什么：“农民在炎热的日光下种田，汗流如雨，这不是出于他的自愿，而是被迫的。假如让他在家里乘凉睡觉，那他是非常愿意的。”中国的赫鲁晓夫站在反动的资产阶级立场上，一贯地无视我国劳动农民的革命性，更看不到解放后广大贫下中农走社会主义道路的积极性。他认为只有具备了大量的机器，用机器牵着农民的鼻子走，农民才会被迫地走农业集体化的道路。中国的赫鲁晓夫所以这样藐视农民，而又是那样看重机器，并不奇怪。因为不论过去和现在，一切资本主义的工厂主、农场主，都把工人、农民看作是会说话的机器。实际上，他把机器看得比人还重要；工人要跟着机器转，工人是机器的附属品。
    同中国的赫鲁晓夫针锋相对，我们伟大的领袖毛主席坚信广大贫下中农有走社会主义道路的积极性，坚信党能够领导农民走社会主义道路。在农业合作化过程中，毛主席看到共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展，高兴地指出：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”正是在伟大舵手毛主席的关怀和指引下，昔阳县广大农民在实现集体化的过程中，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，充分地发挥了人的因素的作用，夺取了一个又一个胜利。论自然条件，昔阳县在山西是较差的，“七梯一沟二分平”。大寨的自然条件又是昔阳县里较差的，“七沟八梁一面坡”。按照中国的赫鲁晓夫的“理论”，不管是昔阳县或是大寨大队，要等机械化了再实现集体化，那就只能眼巴巴地看着资本主义泛滥成灾，看着广大贫下中农继续受苦受难。昔阳县的广大贫下中农和全国的广大贫下中农一样，牢记最敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导：“我们自己的命运完全应当由我们自己来掌握。”大长革命志气，大立社会主义思想。陈永贵同志当时就斩钉截铁地驳斥了中国的赫鲁晓夫先机械化后集体化的谬论，他说：“抗日战争中，我们用手榴弹加土造地雷，打败了洋枪加大炮的日本鬼子；解放战争中，又用小米加步枪，消灭了美国武装起来的八百万国民党反动军队。现在搞社会主义，为什么就要先有了机器再实现农业集体化呢？要等有了机器再干社会主义，那不是什么都耽搁了；每个人长着的两只手，不也就没有用处了？”
    事实完全证明，实现农业集体化最重要的准备工作和条件，不是机器而是人，是人的思想革命化。遵循毛主席的教导，广大农民积极走互助合作的道路，在三大革命运动中，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，提高了社会主义思想觉悟，培养了集体生产和集体生活的习惯，同时也造就了一大批具有社会主义觉悟、能够领导和管理集体经济的基层干部。毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”社会主义思想、习惯和人材的准备，对于实现农业集体化来说，比机器不知要重要多少倍。正是因为有了这样的条件，水到渠成，昔阳县的农村，虽然自然条件不好，也没有使用上机器，但和全国广大农村一样，在互助合作的基础上，走上了农业集体化的光明大道，实现了人民公社化。
    等机械化了再实现集体化就是妄图阻止生产力的发展
    中国的赫鲁晓夫口口声声叫嚷，先实现机械化，然后再实现集体化，好象他是重视发展生产力的。其实，这是他妄图阻止发展生产力的一个幌子。农村土地改革完成后，过去无地少地的农民分得了土地，这对生产力是一次解放。但是，如果我们就此停顿下来，不继续变革生产关系，把分散生产的农民组织起来，进一步解放生产力，就会出现两极分化，对生产力起破坏作用，更谈不到发挥人力物力的潜力。毛主席教导我们说：“诚然，生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者。然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用，这也是必须承认的。当着不变更生产关系，生产力就不能发展的时候，生产关系的变更就起了主要的决定的作用。”事实证明，毛主席的论断无比正确。
    土地改革后的农民，依然是个体农民，对于改造自然面貌，抗御自然灾害，发展生产，受到很大的限制。当我们把互助组提高到合作社以后，就发生了根本变化。过去一家一户根本办不到、甚至没有想到的事情办到了。合作化后，不仅建设了防洪排涝的山水渠，而且规模再大一些的闸沟、治岭、修水库等农田水利基本建设工程也搞成功了。至于合理使用劳动力、因地制宜种植农作物、积累公共财富等方面的好处更是说不尽。毛主席在合作化高潮时说过：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”毛主席的话是对合作化运动进一步解放了生产力的最正确的概括，是对五亿农民组织起来走社会主义道路的最高评价和巨大鼓舞。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫抛出的先机械化后集体化的反动谬论，从根本上抹煞了变革生产关系对生产力发展的促进作用，抹煞了在发展生产中群众自觉革命活动的重大意义。从个体生产，到实现合作化，不仅使生产关系起了质的变化，也使农民的思想发生了革命的飞跃。概括地说来，他们不再把土地看作是命根子，而是靠劳动吃饭；不再靠天，而是靠人；不再靠个体经济，而是靠集体经济。这种变化大大地促进了生产的发展。
    历史上一切剥削阶级，在它处于没落时期，最害怕变革生产关系，也就是最怕受压迫的人民起来革他们的命，造他们的反，触犯他们的根本利益。因此，他们总是拚死挣扎，企图阻止生产关系的变革。中国的赫鲁晓夫这个钻到党内的最大的资产阶级代理人，干的就是这样可耻的勾当。每当革命急剧向前发展的时候，他总是本能地跳出来叫嚣，什么“社会主义是将来的事情”，“冒进了”，“人民公社办早了”……。尽管几个苍蝇嗡嗡叫，地球照样在转，中国农村的社会主义事业照样迅速发展。农业合作化“这是大海的怒涛，一切妖魔鬼怪都被冲走了。社会上各种人物的嘴脸，被区别得清清楚楚。”妄图阻止变革生产关系，也就是不要革命、反对革命的中国赫鲁晓夫，自然也在合作化运动的怒涛中碰得头破血流。
    等实现了机械化再搞集体化也就是不要机械化
    我们从来就认为，积极发展工业，实现国家工业化，用先进的技术装备农业，对于把农业由小规模的经营变为大规模的经营，进一步提高农业生产水平，具有十分重要的意义。但是，这同中国的赫鲁晓夫先机械化后集体化的滥调，没有丝毫共同之处。中国的赫鲁晓夫是要农民坐着不动，等着恩赐，有了机器以后，再实现集体化，实际是妄图使农业资本主义化。毛主席教导说：“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”怎样才能使农业采用先进的技术、实现农业机械化呢？毛主席给我们指出的正确途径是，“必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”这是因为：首先，农业机器不是凭空来的。农业是发展国民经济的基础。实现了农业集体化，发挥了人力物力的潜力，增加了粮食和工业原料，轻工业发展了，国家资金增多了，才可能发展重工业，生产出又多又好的农业机器。以昔阳县为例，一九四九年土地改革刚结束时，每年粮食总产量只有六千多万斤，到一九五三年全面组织起来后，每年粮食总产量为八千多万斤，当年向国家缴售粮食两千八百多万斤。到一九五八年高级合作社后期，每年粮食总产量为一亿多斤。大寨大队在解放初期，每年要吃国家粮食二、三万斤，到全面组织起来后的一九五三年，就向国家缴售粮食六万五千斤；到一九五八年后，每年平均向国家缴售粮食二十四万斤，每户平均卖余粮三千斤，超过国家定购任务的两倍。其次，即使有了农业机器，也只有农民组织起来以后，土地连成片，进行了必要的农田基本建设，生产发展了，收入增加了，有了一定的公共积累，才能买得起，用得上。一家一户分散生产的农民是无法使用机器的。就以推广新式农具来说，昔阳县于一九五三年开始推广双轮双铧犁，也只有合作社才买得起，用得上；互助组是无力使用的，更不要说单干农户了。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫用尽一切恶毒的词句，抹煞合作化的必要性和优越性。说什么“把农业生产互助组，提高到农业生产合作社，以此为新的因素，去‘战胜农民的自发势力’。这是一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想。”只有他的先机械化后集体化，才是“正确”的思想。这完全是颠倒是非、混淆黑白。
    土地改革后，不积极组织互助组、合作社，农民就要重新回到少数人富裕、大多数人贫困的老路上去。广大劳动农民连肚皮都填不饱，那还有什么社会主义的农业机械化？中国的赫鲁晓夫猖狂地反对农业集体化，十足暴露了他作为地主、富农的总代表的嘴脸。地主、富农怎样仇视、咒骂、破坏农业合作化，中国的赫鲁晓夫就如法炮制。所不同的是：前者咒骂和破坏在暗处，后者则咒骂和破坏在明处；前者是暴露在光天化日之下的，后者是隐蔽在党内、而且窃踞要职的。当然他们的下场是共同的，都成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
