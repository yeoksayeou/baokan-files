Chairman Mao's Heart Forever Beats with Ours
—Chairman Mao's Seventh Review of the Cultural Revolution Army

On November 10, 1966, our dearest and most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao inspected revolutionary students and Red Guards for the seventh time from Tiananmen Gate. The Tiananmen Square was a sea of red flags and thunderous cheers.

At 10 a.m., our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao ascended Tiananmen Gate. The red sea of Tiananmen Square instantly surged with excitement! A long-cherished wish finally came true! Revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country, riding in 6,000 vehicles, paraded through Tiananmen Square in formation to receive the inspection of our great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao. The entire convoy stretched over 30 li, forming a vast and mighty red torrent.

The revolutionary youths held high the red book of Chairman Mao, gazing at the benevolent face of our great leader Chairman Mao, and shouted in unison a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

At 3:03 p.m., the most thrilling moment arrived! Our greatest leader Chairman Mao shouted from Tiananmen Gate to the people of the nation, "Long live comrades!" Ten thousand people shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" This is the greatest, most intimate, and most touching voice in human history. This voice is the greatest battle cry; this voice is the greatest source of encouragement. The people love our great leader Chairman Mao the most, and our great leader Chairman Mao loves the people the most. The leader and the people will forever be heart to heart!

Our great leader Chairman Mao understands the aspirations of the masses the best. On the afternoon of November 11, he rode in an open-top car and came among the revolutionary students and Red Guards again! The 26-li-long red avenue was a surging sea of 1.5 million revolutionary students and Red Guards.

Under the leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, the mighty torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution will advance victoriously and forever!
