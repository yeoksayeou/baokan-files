The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country sent a note to the British government on the 20th, demanding that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities revoke the ban on three patriotic newspapers in Hong Kong within 48 hours, release all detained patriotic journalists, and withdraw all illegal lawsuits against patriotic newspapers and printing companies. They must also restore the normal operations of the newspapers and printing companies that have been persecuted. However, the Hong Kong authorities remained obstinate and not only did they not accept our country's stern demands, but they also intensified their persecution of patriotic journalists in Hong Kong. Hong Kong patriots expressed great anger over this. The Hong Kong fascist authorities illegally "interrogated" the editor-in-chief of the *Hong Kong Evening News*, Hu Di Zhou, the editor-in-chief of the *Tian Feng Daily*, Pan Huai Wei, the printing supervisor Chen Yan Juan, the chairman of the Nanchang Printing Company and printing supervisor of the *Hong Kong Commercial Daily*, Li Shao Xiong, and the manager of the Nanchang Printing Company, Zhai Nuan Hui, on the 21st and 22nd. They fabricated many new "charges" against them, increasing the original 30 charges to 72, and the illegal "interrogations" will continue on the 23rd.

On the 21st, the Hong Kong fascist authorities also illegally "interrogated" the five journalists who were illegally abducted on July 29: Luo Yu He from Xinhua News Agency, Huang Yi Liu from the *Wen Wei Po*, Wang Ning from the *Ta Kung Pao*, Chen Zi Feng from the *Hong Kong Commercial Daily*, and Wu Zai Cheng from the *Jing Bao*. The Hong Kong "judge" announced that they would continue the illegal "interrogations" on August 31, September 1, 2, and 4, attempting to further persecute them.

Xue Ping from Xinhua News Agency and Xu Yun Cheng from the *Economic Guide* have been illegally imprisoned for two years. Chen Feng Ying, Chen De Mu from Xinhua News Agency, Tan Si Jun, Luo Xiang Rong from the *Ta Kung Pao*, and Xian Bao Wen, Liang Li Yi from the *Xin Wan Bao* were illegally imprisoned for a month and returned to their posts on August 11, 12, and 17, respectively. However, the Hong Kong fascist authorities have yet to withdraw their so-called "verdicts." Another journalist from the *Wen Wei Po*, Liu Zhu Ping, was released after being illegally imprisoned for over a month on August 18. On August 19, Hong Kong police raided and looted the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tian Feng Daily*, and *Xin Wu Bao*, illegally arresting 34 newspaper staff. After being brutally beaten and illegally "interrogated," they were released because no "charges" could be fabricated. However, the Hong Kong authorities ordered two of them to report to the "police station" for "interrogation" on the 21st.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong fascist authorities not only failed to comply with the stern demands of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to withdraw the ban on the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tian Feng Daily*, and *Xin Wu Bao*, and to withdraw the illegal lawsuits against the *Ta Kung Pao*, *Jing Bao*, Nanchang Printing Company, and Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company, but they also intensified their persecution of patriotic newspapers. At around 5 PM on the 22nd, when Fei Yi Min, the editor-in-chief of the *Ta Kung Pao*, and Chen Xia Zi, the editor-in-chief of the *Jing Bao*, held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists to expose the political persecution by the Hong Kong authorities, the Hong Kong authorities sent a large number of armed police. Several of them rushed into the *Ta Kung Pao*, beat two employees in the sales department, and illegally abducted the editor, Zhong Shi Yi. After being illegally "interrogated" for over five hours at the "police station," Zhong Shi Yi was released at around 10 PM. Inside the "police station," Zhong Shi Yi was also brutally beaten by Hong Kong police, sustaining serious injuries to his head, chest, and hands.

Over the past two days, the Hong Kong authorities have incited American and Kuomintang newspapers and radio stations in Hong Kong to viciously attack, slander, and curse our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note. They have colluded and acted in cahoots, threatening to continue new persecutions against our Hong Kong patriotic newspapers and journalists.

Hong Kong patriotic newspapers, journalists, and compatriots are extremely angry at the intensified persecution of our patriotic news industry and journalists by the Hong Kong fascist authorities. They pointed out: The British government and the Hong Kong fascist authorities' obstinate attitude is absolutely intolerable to the 700 million people of our country and the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. They must bear all the serious consequences. They resolutely declared: Hong Kong patriotic compatriots will further unite and organize to give the Hong Kong fascist authorities double punishment. They must fight to bring down and expose the British imperialists in Hong Kong!

    港英进一步迫害我爱国新闻工作者
    香港爱国同胞愤怒表示，一定加强团结加倍惩罚港英法西斯当局
    新华社香港二十二日电　我国外交部二十日照会英国政府，限令英国政府和港英当局必须在四十八小时内撤销对香港三家爱国报纸的停刊令，无罪释放所有被捕的爱国新闻工作者和撤销对爱国报纸和印刷公司的非法诉讼，并恢复受迫害的报纸和印刷公司的正常业务之后，港英当局顽固到底，不但没有接受我国的严正要求，相反地对香港爱国新闻工作者进行变本加厉的迫害。香港爱国同胞对此表示极大的愤怒。港英法西斯当局悍然在二十一日和二十二日非法“审讯”《香港夜报》社长胡棣周，《田丰日报》社长潘怀伟、督印人陈艳娟，南昌印务公司董事长、《香港商报》督印人李少雄和南昌印务公司经理翟暖晖等五人，并对他们罗织了许多新“罪名”，两天内从原有的三十项增加至七十二项，非法“审讯”还将在二十三日继续进行。
    二十一日，港英法西斯当局又对在七月二十九日被非法绑架的新华社记者罗玉和、《文汇报》记者黄一溜、《大公报》记者王宁、《香港商报》记者陈子峰和《晶报》记者吴在城等五人进行非法“审讯”。港英“法官”还宣布，将在八月三十一日，九月一日、二日和四日继续非法“审讯”，企图对他们进行进一步的迫害。
    已被港英法西斯当局非法“判刑”两年的新华社记者薛平和《经济导报》记者许云程，仍被非法囚禁。被非法“判罪”的新华社记者陈凤英、陈德穆、《大公报》记者谭思俊、罗向荣和《新晚报》记者邝宝文、梁丽仪六人，被非法囚禁了一个月，分别于八月十一日、十二日和十七日回到自己的战斗岗位，但港英法西斯当局至今仍不撤销对他们的所谓“判决”。另一名《文汇报》记者刘柱平被非法囚禁了一个多月后，在八月十八日被释放。八月十九日港英警察在袭击和搜劫《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》时，还非法逮捕了三十四名报社职工。这些职工被残酷毒打和非法“讯问”后，因无法罗织“罪名”，后又全部被释放。但港英当局强令其中两人在二十一日到“警署”接受“传讯”。
    与此同时，港英法西斯当局不仅没有按照我国外交部照会的严正要求，撤销对《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》的停刊令和撤销对《大公报》、《晶报》以及南昌印务公司和香港报业印刷公司的非法诉讼，相反，还对爱国报纸进行新的迫害。二十二日下午五时许，当《大公报》社长费彝民和《晶报》社长陈霞子举行中外记者招待会，揭露港英当局对他们的政治迫害时，港英当局竟派出大批武装警察，其中几名冲入《大公报》，在门市部内殴打两名工作人员，并非法绑架这家报纸的编辑钟式?。港英“警署”对钟式讌进行了五个多小时的非法“讯问”后，在晚上十时许才释放。在“警署”内，钟式讌还遭到港英警察的残酷毒打，头部、胸部和手部都受重伤。
    这两天内，港英当局纵容香港的美、蒋报纸和电台对我外交部照会进行恶毒的攻击、污蔑和咒骂。它们互相勾结、狼狈为奸，叫嚣要对我香港爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者继续进行新的迫害。
    香港爱国报纸、爱国新闻工作者和爱国同胞对于港英法西斯当局对我爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者进行变本加厉的迫害，极为愤怒。他们指出：英国政府和港英法西斯当局这种顽固态度，是我国七亿人民和香港爱国同胞所绝对不能容忍的，它必须对此承担一切严重后果。他们坚决表示：香港爱国同胞将进一步团结起来，组织起来，给港英法西斯当局以加倍的惩罚，一定要把港英帝国主义斗垮、斗臭！
