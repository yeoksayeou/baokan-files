The peasants of Naxalbari in Darjeeling district, India, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have reignited the torch of the Telangana peasant armed revolution, which had been extinguished by the revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India. This red torch illuminates the path to victory for the Indian revolution and points the direction for the Indian revolution's advance.

As soon as the storm of the Naxalbari peasant revolution arose, the traitorous clique of Dange and various revisionist elements such as Nambudripad immediately jumped out to viciously attack and slander the great deeds of the revolutionary peasants of Naxalbari. Meanwhile, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India resolutely led the peasants down the path of armed struggle. This is a continuation of the long-standing struggle between two lines within the Communist Party of India.

After the Second World War, there has been a fundamental and sharp struggle between two lines within the Communist Party of India. One line is the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, advocated by the revolutionary faction within the Communist Party of India. This line advocates following the path of the Chinese revolution, mobilizing the peasantry in India, establishing a people's army, building rural revolutionary base areas, and ultimately seizing national victory through protracted armed struggle and encircling the cities from the countryside. The other line is the revisionist line advocated by Dange, Nambudripad, and others. They promote the so-called "Indian exceptionalism," advocating the parliamentary path of "peaceful transition," opposing violent revolution, and demanding that the revolutionary people who have already taken up arms disarm and cease their struggle. This is a thoroughgoing line of capitulation, a counter-revolutionary line.

The history of the Indian revolution proves that wherever the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought prevails, a vigorous revolutionary situation emerges; conversely, wherever the revisionist line prevails, the revolutionary people are betrayed, and the revolution suffers defeat.

From 1946 to 1951, the armed struggle of the peasants in the Telangana region of India was the result of the victory of the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, relying closely on the peasants, established an armed struggle base area in the Telangana region. Simultaneously, in states like Kerala and West Bengal, peasant armed struggles also broke out one after another. However, this favorable situation for the Indian revolution was ultimately sabotaged by the revisionist line advocated by Dange and others. They used the despicable tactic of "negotiating the resolution of the Telangana struggle" to force the revolutionary peasants to lay down their arms, thereby strangling this magnificent revolutionary movement in India.

The failure of the Chinese revolution from 1925 to 1927 was the result of the betrayal by the opportunist and revisionist line represented by Chen Duxiu. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that due to Chen Duxiu's line of capitulation, "the result was that in a few months in 1927, all the rights that the people had already gained were completely lost." The Chen Duxius of India, similarly, at the critical moment of the Indian people's revolution, implemented a policy of capitulation and betrayal, causing the fruits of the Indian people's revolutionary struggle to be squandered in a very short time. This is a bitter historical lesson for the Indian people.

The "special Indian path" advocated by the traitorous clique of Dange and the revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India, that is, the parliamentary path, is a complete deception of the people. In essence, it is nothing more than using the banner of "Communist" to kneel before the feet of the landlord-bureaucratic bourgeoisie, seeking a position or two, and loyally serving to suppress and extinguish the people's revolution, maintaining the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackeys in India.

The struggle between the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and the revisionist line is related to the success or failure of the Indian revolution and the fate and future of the 500 million people of India. If the Indian revolution follows the path of the Chinese revolution, follows the path of Mao Zedong, the revolution will gradually achieve victory. If the revisionist line is followed, the Indian working people will not be able to liberate themselves, and India will further become a vassal of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of the line."

The Communist revolutionaries and revolutionary people of India need to deeply learn the historical lessons of Telangana, and in politics, ideology, and organization, draw a clear line of demarcation with the revisionist line, and resolutely fight against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique. The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India will surely gather its strength in the struggle, establish a genuine Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary party. Only in this way can the correct revolutionary line be resolutely implemented, leading the Indian people to overcome imperialism and its lackeys, and strive for the final victory of the Indian people's revolution.

    特仑甘纳的历史教训
    本报评论员
    印度大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里地区的农民，在印共革命派的领导下，重新点燃起被印共修正主义分子扑灭了的特仑甘纳农民武装革命的光辉的火炬。这个红色的火炬，照亮着印度革命胜利的道路，指明着印度革命前进的方向。
    纳萨尔巴里农民革命的风暴一兴起，丹吉叛徒集团和南布迪里巴德等形形色色的修正主义分子，马上跳出来无耻地攻击和诬蔑纳萨尔巴里革命农民的伟大壮举，而印共革命派则坚决领导农民走武装斗争的道路。这是长期以来印共党内两条路线斗争的继续。
    第二次世界大战以后，印度共产党内一直存在着两条路线的根本对立和尖锐复杂的斗争。一条是印共党内革命派所坚持的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，这就是走中国革命胜利的道路，要在印度放手发动农民革命，建立一支人民的军队，建设农村革命根据地，经过长期的武装斗争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国的胜利。另一条是丹吉、南布迪里巴德之流所推行的修正主义路线。他们鼓吹所谓印度“特殊论”，主张走“和平过渡”的议会道路，反对暴力革命，并且要已经拿起武器的革命人民解除武装，停止斗争。这是一条彻头彻尾的投降主义路线，是反革命的路线。
    印度革命的历史证明，那个地方马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线占统治地位，那里就出现蓬蓬勃勃的革命形势；反之，那个地方修正主义路线占了上风，那里的革命人民就要被出卖，革命就要遭到失败。
    一九四六年至一九五一年印度特仑甘纳地区农民武装斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想革命路线胜利的结果。当时，印共革命派紧紧依靠农民，曾经在特仑甘纳地区建立了武装斗争根据地。同时在喀拉拉、西孟加拉等许多邦内，也先后爆发了农民武装斗争。但是，这样一个印度革命的大好形势，终于被丹吉之流推行的修正主义路线所葬送。他们用所谓“谈判解决特仑甘纳斗争”的卑鄙手段，迫使革命农民放下武器，扼杀了印度这场轰轰烈烈的革命运动。
    中国一九二五年至一九二七年大革命的失败，就是以陈独秀为代表的机会主义、修正主义叛卖的结果。我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，由于陈独秀机会主义的投降路线，“结果在一九二七年的几个月内，把人民已经取得的权利统统丧失干净。”印度的陈独秀们，同样是在印度人民革命的紧要关头，实行投降叛卖政策，使印度人民革命斗争所获得的成果，在极短的时间内付诸东流。这是印度人民惨痛的历史教训。
    丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子所鼓吹的印度“特殊”道路，即议会道路，完全是愚弄人民的大骗局。拆穿了说，无非就是打着“共产党人”的招牌，拜倒在地主官僚资产阶级的脚下，讨得个一官半职，为阻止和扑灭人民革命、维护帝国主义及其走狗在印度的反动统治而尽忠效劳。
    印共革命派同修正主义路线的斗争，关系到印度革命的成败，关系到印度五亿人民的命运和前途。走中国革命的道路，走毛泽东的道路，印度的革命就会一步一步地取得胜利。如果按照修正主义路线办事，印度劳动人民就不可能翻身解放，印度就会进一步沦为美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的附庸。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”
    印度革命的共产党人和革命的人民，需要深刻地吸取特仑甘纳的历史教训，在政治上、思想上和组织上同修正主义路线彻底划清界线，对以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。印共革命派必将在斗争中聚集自己的力量，建立一个真正马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命党。只有这样，才能够坚决执行正确的革命路线，领导印度人民战胜帝国主义及其走狗，去争取印度人民革命的最后胜利。
