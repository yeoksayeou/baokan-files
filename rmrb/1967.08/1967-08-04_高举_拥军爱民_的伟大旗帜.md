The proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan is surging forward like the mighty Yangtze River.

In this excellent revolutionary situation, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and the broad ranks of soldiers have responded most enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." The army and people are united in struggle, jointly pushing forward the great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Wuhan to a new, magnificent high tide.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a matchless people's army personally created by our great leader Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is an army of heroes armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. This army is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the strongest support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This army has responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "three supports and two militaries," making outstanding contributions and achieving new merits in the proletarian cultural revolution.

In this heart-rending class struggle in Wuhan, the broad ranks of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who stand firmly with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have stepped forward, resolutely supporting and defending the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and defeating a handful of reactionaries. They have proven with their actions that the People's Liberation Army is indeed the loyal defender of the proletarian cultural revolution and a good soldier loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The leadership of the Wuhan Military Region made mistakes in direction and line in their "support the left" work. However, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, they have taken a correct stand and policy, making a public self-criticism to the broad revolutionary masses; and they have expressed their determination to resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan.

This revolutionary action by the leadership of the Wuhan Military Region has immediately been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan. This powerfully proves the high prestige of the People's Liberation Army among the broad masses and embodies the support and care of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat for the people's army.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching that "without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." They should strengthen their close cooperation with the People's Liberation Army, unite as one, and fight the enemy together. They should enthusiastically help and support the comrades in the army, helping them understand the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in the locality and further doing a good job in the "three supports and two militaries." They should learn from the modest and prudent good style of the People's Liberation Army, and in handling military-civilian relations, they should also make serious self-criticisms and guard against the instigation and sowing of discord by class enemies. If the comrades in the army make mistakes, "as long as they correct them seriously, it will be fine." Do not arbitrarily and excessively accuse them or not allow revolution.

"Supporting the army and loving the people" is Chairman Mao's consistent brilliant idea. In this proletarian cultural revolution, it has new content and greater significance. It is the strategic slogan for advancing the proletarian cultural revolution, the general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses in the proletarian cultural revolution, and the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

At present, a handful of reactionaries in Wuhan, in a situation of being deserted by all and having nowhere to go, are adopting more treacherous and vicious means to instigate discord between the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Under these circumstances, we must not have the slightest complacency or relaxation. We must hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen the unity between the army and the people, handle military-civilian relations well, foil all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies, and achieve new, great victories in the proletarian cultural revolution!

    高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜
    武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，有如波涛汹涌的长江，奔腾向前。
    在一片大好的革命形势中，武汉的无产阶级革命派和广大指战员最热烈地响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，军民团结战斗，共同把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区代理人的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，推向波澜壮阔的新高潮。
    中国人民解放军是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席亲自指挥的一支举世无双的人民军队，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的军队。这支军队，是无产阶级专政的最坚强的柱石，是无产阶级革命派的最坚强的后盾。这支军队，坚决响应毛主席“三支”“两军”的伟大号召，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了杰出的贡献，立下了新的功劳。
    在武汉地区的这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，紧紧地和无产阶级革命派站在一起的人民解放军广大指战员，挺身而出，坚决支持和保卫了无产阶级革命派，打败了一小撮反动家伙。他们用自己的行动证明了，人民解放军不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者，不愧为忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的好战士！
    武汉部队领导机关在“支左”工作中曾经犯了方向、路线的错误。但是，他们在毛主席、党中央的英明领导下，采取了正确的立场和政策，向广大革命群众公开作了检讨；并且表示要坚决支持无产阶级革命派，坚决打倒武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    武汉部队领导机关的这个革命行动，立即得到了武汉地区无产阶级革命派的热烈欢迎。这有力地证明了人民解放军在广大群众中的崇高威信，体现了无产阶级革命派对人民军队的支持和爱护。
    无产阶级革命派在任何时候，都要牢记毛主席的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”这一伟大教导。应当加强同人民解放军的紧密合作，团结一致，共同对敌。应当满腔热情地帮助和支持军队的同志，帮助他们了解当地无产阶级文化大革命的情况，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作。应当学习人民解放军谦虚谨慎的优良作风，在处理军民关系中，也要作认真的自我批评，严防阶级敌人的挑拨离间。军队的同志有了错误，“只要认真改了，就好了。”而不要无根据地无限上纲，不要不许革命。
      “拥军爱民”是毛主席一贯的光辉思想。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，它具有更新的内容，更伟大的意义。它是推进无产阶级文化大革命的战略口号，是在无产阶级文化大革命中正确处理军队和革命群众之间关系的总原则，是取得无产阶级文化大革命胜利的根本保证。
    当前，武汉地区一小撮反动家伙，在众叛亲离、走投无路的情况下，正在采取更加阴险、毒辣的手段，来挑拨人民解放军同无产阶级革命派之间的关系。在这种情况下，我们决不能有丝毫的麻痹和松懈。我们一定要更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，把军民团结搞得牢牢的，把军民关系处理得好好的，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利！
