On August 18 last year, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao, received and reviewed the revolutionary vanguard Red Guards who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Tiananmen.

Over the past year, the heroic Red Guard youngsters, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have shown the spirit of daring to venture, daring to act, daring to make revolution, and daring to rebel. They have strongly opposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, becoming the vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have made immortal contributions.

The Revolutionary Actions of the Red Guards

The revolutionary actions of the Red Guard youngsters not only shook the entire China but also shook the entire world. From the beginning, the Red Guards appeared on the stage of international class struggle with a heroic and combative posture. They have been fiercely opposed to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, and have been full of enthusiasm and firm support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. Their revolutionary spirit of rebellion and actions have made the revolutionary people of the world rejoice and have made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble with fear.

The Red Guard youngsters' unlimited loyalty, love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao have greatly inspired and encouraged the revolutionary people of all countries. Over the past year, the revolutionary people and friends from the five continents have enthusiastically praised the Chinese Red Guards. They call the Red Guards "loyal standard-bearers of Mao Zedong Thought, good students of Chairman Mao, and good soldiers of Chairman Mao," expressing their desire to "follow the Red Guards in adhering to Mao Zedong Thought and making revolution forever." They praise the Chinese Red Guards for having "China's revolution and the world's revolution in their hearts," calling them a powerful "world shock brigade" against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. A Brazilian friend, Martins, enthusiastically said: "Compared to the billions of new-type heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought that have appeared in the world, the stars in the sky will seem too few. These new-type heroes will shine forever like stars in the red universe of the proletariat."

The Revolutionary Spirit of the Red Guards Inspires Youth Around the World

Over the past year, the famous name and heroic image of the Chinese Red Guards have crossed mountains and seas, spreading throughout the world. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, which fiercely attack the old world, have greatly aroused the revolutionary will of the people of various countries.

In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, revolutionary youth, inspired by the Chinese Red Guards, have called out, "We too want to rebel, we too want to make revolution."

In Japan, the influence of the Chinese Red Guards has been particularly widespread and profound. Revolutionary youth in Yamaguchi Prefecture held demonstrations against U.S. military bases, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and banners reading "Rebellion is justified," denouncing the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression. At a graduation ceremony at a high school in Tokyo, some students refused to sing songs loyal to the Japanese emperor and distributed leaflets opposing militaristic education. When asked why they dared to do so, they replied without hesitation: "This is the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards." In Thailand, the reactionary newspaper Siam Rath reported in alarm that youth in the eastern and central regions were "imitating the Chinese Red Guards" and engaging in so-called "lawless destructive activities." In some African countries, there have been "Red Guard-style" rebellious actions such as smashing portraits of the British queen and consciously opposing Western decadent lifestyles. A group of African youth returning from China wore Mao badges and shouted "Down with imperialism," expressing their determination to learn from the example of the Chinese Red Guards. In Latin American countries such as Colombia, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, many revolutionary youth have enthusiastically expressed their respect for the Chinese Red Guards. They are determined to "carry out a revolution in Latin America and contribute to the advancement of the world revolution."

In Western Europe, revolutionary youth in France and Italy have published newspapers and magazines named after the "Red Guards" and have adopted "dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act" as their motto. In West Berlin, during a demonstration against U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, hundreds of students shouted the resounding slogan "Long live the Red Guards!" In Norway, bourgeois newspapers acknowledged that the Chinese Red Guards have become the great ideal of many high school students in Oslo. In the streets of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, "Red Guard-style" big-character posters recently appeared, enthusiastically hailing China's hydrogen bomb as the hydrogen bomb of the proletariat of the whole world.

Even under the rule of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union, despite the fact that the Soviet revisionist leadership has blocked, distorted, and slandered the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the Chinese Red Guards, especially the heroic struggle of Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union in Red Square, has broken through the dark clouds of Soviet revisionist rule like a blazing fire, igniting the hope of revolution in the hearts of Soviet revolutionary youth. They have expressed their determination to "raise the torch of Lenin's revolution" and rebel against the Soviet revisionist clique. Revolutionary comrades in Bulgaria have written to express that "the revolutionary masses of the world see not only the hope of China but also the hope of the whole world in the Red Guards."

Imperialists, Revisionists, and Reactionaries Tremble with Fear

Over the past year, the Chinese Red Guards, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao in advancing through the storms and waves of class struggle, growing rapidly. They are becoming reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. They have not only declared the failure of the imperialists' and modern revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in China but have also launched one fierce attack after another against the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

Those American imperialists who have been dreaming of the third and fourth generations of "peaceful evolution" in China have lamented helplessly after the emergence of the Red Guard movement: "No one predicted the appearance of the Red Guards. Their appearance is shocking, and their actions are astonishing." The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist leadership has also cried out in panic: "Hundreds of thousands of young people holding red copies of Chairman Mao's quotations, the entire vast square flashing with red dots, these mass scenes make one shudder." The reactionaries of various countries are also "extremely alarmed" by the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The day the people are happy is the day the counter-revolutionaries are miserable. What they fear is precisely what the revolutionary people rejoice in."

On this historic day, the anniversary of Chairman Mao's reception and review of the Red Guards from all over the country, millions of revolutionary youngsters in our country are advancing with high spirits under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao and the deputy commander Comrade Lin Biao, they are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, making greater contributions to the world revolutionary cause.

    大长世界革命人民的志气  大灭帝修反的威风
    中国红卫兵在全世界产生巨大的革命影响
    本报讯　去年八月十八日，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席在天安门上接见和检阅了在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命闯将红卫兵。
    一年来，英雄的红卫兵小将在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，发扬敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，成了无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的急先锋，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
    各国人民热烈赞扬毛主席的红小兵
    红卫兵小将们的革命行动，不但震动了整个中国，而且震动了整个世界。红卫兵一开始就以英雄的战斗的姿态出现在东方的地平线上，登上了国际阶级斗争的舞台。他们对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派疾恶如仇，大造其反，而对世界各国人民的革命斗争则是满腔热情，坚决支持。他们的革命造反精神和革命行动，使全世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞，使帝修反闻风丧胆。
    红卫兵小将们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚、无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜，使世界各国革命人民受到了极大的感染和鼓舞。一年来，世界五大洲的革命人民和朋友，对中国的红卫兵发出了热烈的欢呼和赞扬。他们把红卫兵称作是“毛泽东思想的忠实旗手，毛主席的好学生，毛主席的好战士”，表示要“象红卫兵一样遵循毛泽东思想永远闹革命”。他们称颂中国红卫兵“心中装着中国革命和世界革命”，是反对帝修反的一支强大的“世界突击队”。巴西朋友马尔丁斯热情洋溢地说：“同世界上出现的亿万个用毛泽东思想武装起来的新型英雄比较，天空中的星星也会显得太少了。这些新型的英雄，将象星星一样永远在无产阶级的红色宇宙中闪耀光辉”。
    红卫兵的革命精神鼓舞了各国青年
    一年来，中国红卫兵的响亮名字和他们的英雄形象，越过高山，越过海洋，传遍了整个世界。红卫兵向旧世界猛烈冲击的革命造反行动，大大地激发了各国人民的革命意志。
    亚非拉许多国家的革命青年，在中国红卫兵的有力鼓舞下，发出了“我们也要造反，我们也要革命”的呼声。
    在日本，中国红卫兵的影响特别广泛而深远。山口县的革命青年参加反对美军基地的示威时，高举着毛主席的画像和“造反有理”的标语牌，声讨美帝侵略罪行。在东京一所高级中学的毕业典礼上，有的学生拒绝唱效忠日本天皇的歌曲，并且散发传单反对军国主义教育。当人们问他们为什么敢于这样做时，他们毫不迟疑地回答说：“这就是中国红卫兵的革命造反精神”。在泰国，反动报纸《暹逻民众报》惊呼东部和中部的青年正在“效法中国红卫兵”，进行所谓“无法无天的破坏活动”。在非洲的一些国家内，曾经发生过砸掉英国女王画像和自觉起来反对西方腐朽生活方式的“红卫兵式”的造反行动。一批从中国回去的非洲青年，佩带毛主席像章，高呼“打倒帝国主义”的口号，表示要学习中国红卫兵的榜样。在拉丁美洲的哥伦比亚、墨西哥和多米尼加，许多革命青年热烈表示向中国红卫兵致敬。他们决心要在拉丁美洲“进行一场革命，为推进世界革命作出贡献”。
    在西欧，法国、意大利的革命青年出版了以“红卫兵”为名的报纸和刊物，并且以“敢想、敢说、敢干”作为自己的座右铭。在西柏林，在一次反对美帝国主义侵略越南的示威中，数百名学生喊出了“红卫兵万岁！”的响亮口号。在挪威，资产阶级报纸承认，中国的红卫兵已经成了奥斯陆许多中学生的伟大理想。在丹麦首都哥本哈根的大街上，不久以前出现了“红卫兵式”的大字报，热烈欢呼中国的氢弹是全世界无产阶级的氢弹。
    在现代修正主义统治下的苏联，尽管苏修领导集团对中国的无产阶级文化大革命进行封锁、歪曲和诽谤，但是中国红卫兵的革命造反精神，特别是中国归国留学生在莫斯科红场上的英勇斗争，却象烈火一样突破了苏修统治下的沉沉黑暗，在苏联革命青年的心头燃起了革命的希望。他们表示要“举起列宁的革命火炬”，造苏修集团的反。保加利亚的革命同志写信表示，“全世界革命群众从（中国）红卫兵身上不仅看到了中国的希望，也看到了全世界的希望”。
    帝修反闻风丧胆心惊胆战
    一年来，中国红卫兵高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，跟着伟大领袖毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断前进，迅速成长。他们正在成为无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人。他们不但宣告了帝国主义、现代修正主义妄想在中国实现资本主义复辟的阴谋的破产，而且向帝修反发动了一次又一次的猛烈冲击。
    那些一直在痴心梦想中国的第三代、第四代“和平演变”的美帝国主义者，在中国红卫兵运动出现以后无可奈何地悲叹道：“谁也没有预言过红卫兵的出现。它的出现令人震惊，而他们的所作所为则令人目瞪口呆”，“象红卫兵进行的那种异乎寻常的令人惊恐的活动……是我们时代最令人不安的现象之一”。苏修领导集团的喉舌也惊慌失措地叫喊道：“上百万年轻人高举红色的毛泽东语录本，整个巨大广场闪烁着一个个红点，这些群众场面使人不寒而栗。”各国反动派对于中国红卫兵的革命造反行动更是感到“异常惊慌”。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”“他们感觉恐怖的事，正是革命的人民大众感觉高兴的事。”
    在毛主席接见和检阅全国红卫兵一周年这个具有历史意义的日子里，我国千百万革命小将正在毛泽东思想指引下斗志昂扬地阔步前进。他们在伟大统帅毛主席和副统帅林彪同志的率领下，高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，并对世界革命事业作出更大的贡献。
