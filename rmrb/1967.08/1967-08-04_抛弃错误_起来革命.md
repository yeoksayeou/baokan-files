	Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper publishes two articles: "How We Helped Comrade Wang Fen" by the Four-Five-One-One Detachment of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and "Abandon Errors and Join the Revolution" by Comrade Wang Fen. These articles are worth careful reading. Through these two articles, we see how a comrade who made mistakes, with the warm and patient help of his comrades, corrected his mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to join the revolution.

	How should we treat comrades who have made mistakes? Should we despise and ignore them, or should we patiently persuade and educate them? The comrades of the Four-Five-One-One Detachment took the correct attitude. Their successful experience proves: In dealing with comrades who have made mistakes, it is not enough to emphasize unity without principles. It is also not enough to emphasize struggle one-sidedly. Only by firmly grasping and using the weapon of "unity-criticism-unity," with the spirit of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," can we both uphold principles, not indulge or tolerate comrades' mistakes, and conduct serious and earnest criticism; and actively, enthusiastically, and patiently provide help, conducting in-depth, detailed, and patient ideological work. This is the only way to unite all those who can be united.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser, and thus we can do things better. 'If one makes mistakes, one should correct them, and the quicker and more thoroughly one corrects them, the better.'"

	Comrade Wang Fen, although she made mistakes during the movement, through studying Chairman Mao's works and with the help of her comrades, after repeated ideological struggles, she overcame her selfishness and private thoughts, quickly and earnestly corrected her mistakes, raised her proletarian political awareness, and stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fighting shoulder to shoulder with revolutionary comrades. We believe that comrades like Wang Fen, after correcting their mistakes and gaining both positive and negative experiences, will surely be able to demand more of themselves and advance victoriously along the revolutionary path with the proletarian revolutionary forces.

	We hope that all comrades who made mistakes during the movement will abandon their past errors, correct their incorrect understandings, actively participate in the current great criticism movement, and strive to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	Abandon Errors and Join the Revolution

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been going on for a whole year. What an extraordinary year it has been! Through this year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory. This year has left me with many unforgettable memories.

	Looking back on the journey of this year, how much water have I drunk, how many detours have I taken, scene by scene, incident by incident, all vividly in my mind. My heart is heavy, deeply feeling that I have let down the dear Party and Chairman Mao's care and expectations. At the critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I did not stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, did not direct my spearhead at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, but instead became a henchman of the bourgeois reactionary line, directing my spearhead at my own class brothers.

	However, at the beginning, I did not realize my mistakes and did not understand the struggle between the two lines. I always thought, "After all, I love the Party and love Chairman Mao. I won't be against the Party or Chairman Mao." Although at this time I had already stepped further and further away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I did not realize it myself. I rejected the help of my comrades and rejected ideological remolding. Looking back now, it was so dangerous! It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me, and it was the help of the worker comrades and the Red Flag fighters that made me gradually realize my mistakes.

	After returning from the factory, my class held a criticism meeting. The Red Flag fighters seriously criticized the mistakes I had made in the past and pointed out the seriousness of the mistakes. I had a lot of resistance and felt that the Red Flag fighters did not understand me and just wanted to label me as a counter-revolutionary. After the meeting, I felt burdened; on one hand, I felt that my mistakes were serious; on the other hand, I had a lot of grievances against the Red Flag fighters. However, after the meeting, the Red Flag fighters did not, as I had imagined, ignore me or distance themselves from me, but came to talk to me. Once, twice, just the class duty officer Li Chenguo alone talked to me four or five times. They analyzed the subjective and objective causes of my mistakes on one hand, and talked about their own experiences of being persecuted by the reactionary line on the other. They said: Comrades criticize your mistakes so severely because they want you to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line better. In a meeting, a Red Flag fighter said passionately: "Half a year ago, the reactionary line concocted by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party scattered us. Today, it is Chairman Mao, it is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that brought us together." These few short sentences made me tearful. Through common struggles, I gradually felt that the Red Flag fighters did not regard me as a counter-revolutionary, but with the attitude of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," helped me return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. My heart gradually became close to the Red Flag fighters, and our feelings gradually became harmonious.

	Today, recalling the process of my gradual change, I deeply feel the great power of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts! Now, I realize: The reason why I stood on the bourgeois reactionary line is, in the final analysis, that I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, and the private thoughts in my mind were not eliminated. If the private thoughts are in charge, one cannot correctly recognize and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, cannot see the correct direction, and will make mistakes in direction and line.

	In the past, I made mistakes, fell several times, and choked several times. Now, should I be afraid to move forward and dare not go into the water again? Or should I stand up, summarize the lessons from the falls, and re-enter the great waves of class struggle to undergo new tempering? This is a new test for comrades who have made serious mistakes.

	Because of my serious mistakes and not having a good self-examination and analysis, I had many ideological burdens and various wrong thoughts.

	Sometimes I thought: Forget it, just withdraw from politics! Now, thinking back, this was actually a self-deceiving and deceiving others' idea, saying to withdraw from politics, but in reality, it was to withdraw from proletarian politics and enter bourgeois politics. Because when you have this thought, in your mind, bourgeois thoughts have actually overwhelmed proletarian thoughts. Chairman Mao said: "In recent times, ideological and political work has weakened among intellectuals and young students, and some deviations have appeared. In the eyes of some people, it seems that politics, the future of the motherland, and human ideals are not worth caring about. It seems that Marxism was fashionable for a while, but now it is not so fashionable." This is such a profound teaching! Such a piercing criticism! When you think of withdrawing from politics, thinking of getting through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carelessly, have you thought about the rise and fall of the country, the direction of the world, have you thought about connecting your life closely with the fate of humanity? No, you only think of yourself. In this fierce class struggle, thinking of being a deserter, such a thought is so shameful. When my ideological struggle was very intense, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in my ears: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any mistakes that we cannot abandon?" My emotions were particularly stirred. Thinking of dear Chairman Mao, thinking of the martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed for the next generation over the past few decades, thinking of the people who nurtured me, could I lie down and do nothing? No! Absolutely not! Because I do not belong to myself, I belong to dear Chairman Mao, I belong to the proletariat. I must fight for Chairman Mao, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fight for the proletariat! I must not, because of past mistakes, be indifferent and numb to national affairs, must not be a hedonist, must be a revolutionary.

	However, I had doubts in my mind: If I do it, what if others say I am a "reactionary turned revolutionary"? This was actually the private thoughts acting up, not believing in the masses, not believing in the revolutionary comrades. For us, first of all, we must believe in the broad revolutionary masses, look at the big direction, humbly learn from them, sincerely speak out our hearts, and obtain their criticism and help. Only in this way can we better join the battle.

	For example, before I posted my self-criticism big-character poster, I had doubts. I thought that after posting it, I might be beaten with a big stick, labeled as a "cultivated" self-criticism, wanting to rebel, wanting to seek personal gain, etc. But the facts educated me. After I posted the big-character poster, many notes signed "Red Flag Soldier" encouraged and supported me, telling me to put down my burdens and join the battle together. Many Red Flag fighters also talked to me, urging me to study the "Three Articles" more, continue to break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, and strive to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line faster. One day, I was walking on the road, and a Red Flag fighter handed me a small note, which read: "Comrade Wang Fen, I hope you put down all burdens, take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and join the battle. Your Red Flag comrades firmly support you—Red Flag Soldier." When I looked up, that comrade had already left. I did not know him, but that small piece of paper made me deeply feel the heart of the Red Flag fighters and the warmth of the revolutionary family. In the past, I always felt that the Red Flag fighters did not understand our hearts of wanting to join the revolution. The facts made me feel that this idea was wrong, and the doubts were unnecessary. Just take my view of the Jian Gangshan comrades, for example. In the past, I kept my distance from people like him, thinking they would never understand our hearts. Through a conversation with him, I found out that I was wrong again. He is the chief duty officer and also an ordinary Red Flag fighter. From his conversation, one can see how much he hopes that we comrades who made mistakes in the past will quickly turn around and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	I deeply feel that for comrades who have made mistakes, setbacks and failures are nothing, they are very difficult to avoid in the process of advancing. The key is whether one dares to face up to mistakes, admit mistakes, and correct mistakes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser, and thus we can do things better. 'If one makes mistakes, one should correct them, and the quicker and more thoroughly one corrects them, the better.'" Falls are not in vain; water is not in vain. After falling, one must learn to walk; after drinking water, one must learn to swim. Only in this way can we follow Chairman Mao and advance in the great waves!

### 抛弃错误　起来革命

专栏：

    编者按：本报今天刊登的北航红旗战斗队四五一一支队写的《我们是如何帮助王芬同志的》和王芬同志写的《抛弃错误，起来革命》两篇文章，值得同志们认真一读。通过这两篇文章，使我们看到了一个犯过错误的同志，在战友们热情地耐心地帮助下，改正了自己的错误，回到了毛主席的革命路线一边，起来闹革命。
    对待犯过错误的同志，应该抱什么态度？是鄙弃不管，还是耐心地说服教育？四五一一支队的同志们采取了正确的态度。他们成功的经验证明：对待犯错误的同志，只讲团结，不要原则是不行的。片面地讲斗争也是不行的。只有不折不扣地掌握运用“团结——批评——团结”的武器，本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神，既坚持原则，不姑息迁就同志的错误，严肃地认真地进行批评；又主动、积极、热情地给以帮助，进行深入、细致、耐心的思想工作，才能团结一切可以团结的人们。
    毛主席教导我们说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”
    王芬同志虽然在运动中犯了错误，但通过学习毛主席著作，在同志们的帮助下，经过自己反复的思想斗争，终于克服了个人主义的私心杂念，迅速地、认真地改正错误，提高了无产阶级政治觉悟，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线这一边来，同革命的同志们并肩战斗。我们相信，象王芬这样的同志，改正了错误以后，获得了正反两面的经验，一定能够更加严格地要求自己，同无产阶级革命派一起沿着革命道路胜利前进。
    希望一切在运动中犯过错误的同志，能够抛弃过去的错误，纠正自己的不正确认识，积极投入当前的革命大批判运动，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋斗！
    抛弃错误　起来革命
    北京航空学院　王芬
    文化大革命整整一年了。这是多么不平凡的一年啊！经过这一年的文化大革命，毛主席的革命路线取得了决定性的胜利。这一年给我留下了许多难忘的回忆。
    回顾这一年走过的里程，我喝了多少口水，走过了多少弯路，一幕幕，一件件，历历在目。我的心情是沉痛的，深深感到辜负了敬爱的党和毛主席对我的关怀和希望。在文化大革命的关键时刻，我没有能够站在毛主席的革命路线上，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，却充当了资产阶级反动路线的打手，把矛头对准了自己的阶级弟兄。
    然而，在开始的时刻，我还认识不到自己的错误，对两条路线的斗争不理解。心里总想，反正我热爱党，热爱毛主席，我是不会反党，反毛主席的。虽然这时我已经一步步远离了毛主席的革命路线，但是自己却还不认识，不觉悟。我拒绝了同志们的帮助，拒绝了思想改造。现在回过头来想一想，是多么危险啊！是党和毛主席挽救了我，是工人师傅和红旗战士的帮助，才使我逐步地认识了自己的错误。
    我下厂回来后，班上开了一次批评会。红旗战士严肃地批评了我过去所犯的错误，指出错误的严重性。我的抵触情绪很大，觉得红旗战士不理解我，就是想把我打成反革命。开过会后，我包袱很重，一方面觉得自己错误是严重的；一方面对红旗战士又是满腹牢骚。可是会后红旗战士并没有象我所想象的那样，不理我，疏远我，而是找我谈心。一次、二次，单是我们班勤务员李成国同志就找我不下四、五次。他们一边给我分析犯错误的主观和客观上的原因，一边谈他们自己受反动路线迫害的情况。他们说：同学们严厉批评你的错误，是为了让你更好地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。在一次会上，一个红旗战士满怀激情地说：半年前，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派炮制的资产阶级反动路线把我们拆散。今天，是毛主席，是毛主席的革命路线使我们走到一起来了。短短的几句话说得我热泪盈眶。通过共同的战斗，我慢慢地感到：红旗战士并没有把我当成反革命，而是抱着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度帮助我回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我的心和红旗战士的心渐渐地贴近了，感情上也渐渐地融洽了。
    今天，回忆一下自己逐步转变的过程，我深深体会到毛主席的光辉思想具有多大的威力啊！现在，我认识到：我所以会站到资产阶级反动路线上去，归根结底就是一条：没有好好学习毛主席著作，头脑中私字没除掉。让私字当家，就不能正确地认识和理解毛主席的革命路线，就认不清大方向，就会犯方向、路线的错误。
    过去犯了错误，跌了几个跟斗，呛了几口水，现在是望而生畏，再也不敢前进，再也不敢下水了呢？还是爬起来，总结跌跤的教训，重新投入到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去经受新的锻炼呢？这对于犯过严重错误的同志，是一个新的考验。
    我由于犯了严重错误，又没有很好地检查分析，思想上背了许多包袱，出现了种种错误的想法。
    有时候想：算了，干脆退出政治吧！现在想起来，这实际上是骗人又骗己的念头，说是退出政治，实质上是退出无产阶级政治，而进入了资产阶级政治。因为当你产生这种想法的时候，头脑中实际上已经是资产阶级思想压倒了无产阶级思想。毛主席说：“在知识分子和青年学生中间，最近一个时期，思想政治工作减弱了，出现了一些偏向。在一些人的眼中，好象什么政治，什么祖国的前途，人类的理想，都没有关心的必要。好象马克思主义行时了一阵，现在就不那么行时了。针对着这种情况，现在需要加强思想政治工作。”这是多么深切的教导啊！多么一针见血的批评呀！当你想到退出政治，想马马虎虎地混过这次文化大革命时，你想过国家的兴亡，世界的去向，想过把自己的一生紧紧地和人类的命运相连吗？没有，想到的只是自己。在这激烈的阶级斗争中，想当逃兵，这种想法是多么可耻。当我思想斗争十分激烈的时候，耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我的心情特别激动。想起亲爱的毛主席，想起几十年为下一代流血牺牲的烈士们，想起抚育我长大的人民，我能躺倒不干吗？不能！决不能！因为我不是属于我自己的，我是属于敬爱的毛主席，属于无产阶级的。要为毛主席而战斗，为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，为无产阶级而战斗！决不能因为过去犯了错误，而对国家大事漠不关心，麻木不仁，决不能当逍遥派，要当革命派。
    但是，我思想又有顾虑：干，别人说你“老保翻天”怎么办？这实际上还是私字在作怪，不相信群众，不相信革命派的同志们。对我们来讲，首先要相信广大革命派的战士，看其大方向，虚心向他们学习，诚恳地说出自己的心里话，取得他们的批评和帮助，这样才能更好地投入战斗。
    比如在我贴出自我检讨的大字报之前，我是有顾虑的，我想，可能贴出之后会遭到一顿大棒子，什么“修养”式的检讨，想翻天，想投机等等，但事实教育了我，我贴出大字报之后，许多署名“红旗一兵”的批语鼓励我、支持我，叫我放下包袱共同投入战斗。又有许多红旗战士和我谈心，让我大学“老三篇”，继续破私立公，争取更快地回到毛主席革命路线上来。有一天，我正走在路上，一个红旗战士递给我一个小条子，上面写着：王芬同志，希望你放下一切包袱，以毛泽东思想为武器，投入战斗，你的红旗战友坚决支持你——“红旗一兵”。当我抬起头来，那个同学已经走了。我并不认识他，但是那一张小小纸条使我深深体会到红旗战士的心，革命大家庭的温暖。过去我总觉得红旗战士对我们要起来革命的心是不理解的，事实使我感到这种想法是错误的，顾虑是没有必要的。就拿我对井冈山同学的看法来说吧，过去我对象他这样的人是敬而远之的，觉得他们根本不会理解我们的心。通过一次和他的谈话，我发现我又错了。他是总勤务员，又是一名普通的红旗战士。从他谈话中可以看出，他是多么希望我们过去犯了错误的同志赶快转过来，回到毛主席的革命路线上来呀。
    我深深体会到，对于犯过错误的同志来讲，挫折和失败算不了什么，这是前进中很难避免的。关键在于自己是否敢于正视错误，承认错误，改正错误。毛主席教导我们说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”跤，不能白跌；水，不能白喝。跌了跤，要学会走路；喝了水，要学会游泳。只有这样，我们才能跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进！
