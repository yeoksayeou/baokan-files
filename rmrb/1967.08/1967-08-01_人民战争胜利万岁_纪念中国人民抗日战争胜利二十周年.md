The great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan has been exactly twenty years. Twenty years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after a long period of heroic struggle, finally defeated the Japanese imperialists who attempted to annihilate China and annex Asia, and achieved the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan was an important part of the world war against German, Japanese, and Italian fascism. The Chinese people received support from the people and anti-fascist forces of the whole world. The Chinese people also made a significant contribution to the victory of the world anti-fascist war.

The War of Resistance Against Japan was the first war in which the Chinese people, in a hundred years of numerous struggles against imperialism, achieved a complete victory. This war not only occupies an extremely important position in the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary wars but also in the history of the wars of oppressed nations against imperialist aggression worldwide.

The War of Resistance Against Japan was a war in which a semi-colonial and semi-feudal weak country defeated an imperialist strong country. From the time the Japanese imperialists invaded our Northeast, the Kuomintang adopted a policy of non-resistance for a long period. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese imperialists, using their military superiority, advanced rapidly and occupied half of China. In the face of the Japanese invaders' fierce attacks and the nationwide anti-Japanese upsurge, the Kuomintang was forced to participate in the war of resistance. However, soon afterward, they adopted a policy of passive resistance and active anti-communism. The burden of the War of Resistance Against Japan fell on the Communist Party of China, which led the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the people of the liberated areas. At the beginning of the war of resistance, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army had only a few tens of thousands of people, with poor weapons and equipment. They were also under the dual pressure of the Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang army. However, they became stronger and stronger through the war and became the main force in defeating the Japanese imperialists.

Why was a weak country able to ultimately defeat a strong country? Why did a seemingly weak army become the main force in the War of Resistance Against Japan?

The fundamental reason is that the War of Resistance Against Japan was a genuine people's war led by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, which implemented the correct political and military lines of Marxism-Leninism. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were genuine people's armies that implemented the entire set of strategies and tactics of people's war formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrade Mao Zedong's series of theories and policies on people's war creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan was the victory of people's war, the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party of China experienced the First Domestic Revolutionary War from 1924 to 1927 and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War from 1927 to 1936. It summarized the experiences and lessons of victory and defeat in the war, established the leading position of Mao Zedong Thought within the Party, and this was the fundamental guarantee for the Communist Party of China to lead the Chinese people to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan prepared the conditions for seizing national power. In 1946, when the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, launched a nationwide civil war, the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong further developed the idea of people's war, led the Chinese people to wage a larger-scale people's war, and in just over three years, achieved the great victory of the War of Liberation, ending the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and establishing the People's Republic of China.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war broke through the imperialist eastern front, greatly changed the balance of power in the world, and promoted the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. From then on, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America entered a new historical period.

Today, American imperialism is repeating in the world what Japanese imperialism did in China and Asia. Mastering and using the weapon of people's war to deal with American imperialism and its running dogs has become an urgent need for the peoples of many countries. American imperialism and its running dogs are using all means to try to extinguish the revolutionary flames of people's war. The Khrushchev revisionists also fear people's war like the plague and slander people's war. They collude with each other to obstruct and sabotage people's war. Under these circumstances, reviewing the historical experience of the great victory of the Chinese people's war and reviewing Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on people's war has particularly significant practical significance.

The main contradictions and the Party's line during the War of Resistance Against Japan

The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong were able to lead the Chinese people to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, first of all, because they formulated and implemented a Marxist-Leninist line.

Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, used the method of class analysis to analyze the main and non-main contradictions in China after the invasion of Japanese imperialism, the changes in class relations and international relations caused by this, and the balance of power between China and Japan, providing a scientific basis for formulating the political and military lines of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

For a long time, China has had two basic contradictions: the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the masses. Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionary clique, representing the interests of imperialism, the big landlords, and the big bourgeoisie, and the Communist Party of China, representing the interests of the Chinese people, and the Red Army it led, had been engaged in a decade of civil war. In 1931, Japanese imperialism occupied China's Northeast, and later, especially after 1935, it further deepened and expanded its aggression against China. The invasion of Japanese imperialism made the contradiction between Japanese imperialism and the Chinese nation extremely sharp, causing new changes in domestic class relations. Stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan became the urgent demand of the people of the whole country. The political attitudes of the national bourgeoisie and various factions within the Kuomintang underwent different degrees of change. The Xi'an Incident in 1936 was the best example.

How to understand the changes in China's political situation? What conclusions should be drawn from these changes? This is a matter of life and death for the Chinese nation.

In the period before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, within the Communist Party of China, the "left" opportunists represented by Wang Ming, ignoring the significant political changes in China caused by the Japanese invasion after 1931, denied the rise of the Chinese-Japanese national contradiction and the anti-Japanese demands of various strata, and insisted on the line of sectarianism, continuing to advocate overthrowing all reactionaries.

Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely opposed the errors of "left" opportunism and deeply analyzed the new situation of the Chinese revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: Japanese imperialism wants to turn China into its colony, making the Chinese-Japanese contradiction rise to the main contradiction. The various class contradictions within China, such as the contradiction between the masses and feudalism, the contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the contradiction between the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, etc., still exist. However, these contradictions, in the face of Japan's invasion war, have all been reduced to secondary and subordinate positions. Except for a small handful of traitors among the big landlords and big bourgeoisie who are pro-Japanese, all classes and strata of people in China have produced a common demand, which is to oppose Japanese imperialism.

Because the Chinese-Japanese contradiction has risen to the main contradiction, the contradiction between China and imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States has also been reduced to a secondary and subordinate position. Japanese imperialism wants to turn China into its colony, which has increased the contradiction between it and imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States. This makes it possible for China to use this contradiction to isolate and oppose Japanese imperialism.

In the face of the Japanese imperialist invasion, should we continue the civil war and land revolution? Or should we raise the banner of national liberation, unite all forces that can be united, establish a broad united front, and concentrate on opposing the Japanese invaders? The problem was put so sharply before our Party.

The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the analysis of the new situation, formulated the line of the anti-Japanese national united front. Our Party raised the banner of national liberation, proposed the demand for national unity and joint resistance to Japan, and received the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. Through the joint efforts of our Party and the patriotic military and civilians of the whole country, the Kuomintang ruling clique was finally forced to stop the civil war, and a new situation of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and joint resistance to Japan emerged.

In the summer of 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression against China. A nationwide war of resistance against Japan broke out.

Could the War of Resistance Against Japan be victorious? How could victory be achieved? This was a question that the people of the whole country urgently needed an answer to.

Defeatists came out and said: China cannot defeat Japan and must perish. Blind optimists came out and said: China will quickly achieve victory and does not need to exert much effort.

Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the two aspects of the main contradiction between the Chinese nation and Japanese imperialism and pointed out that the theory of "national annihilation" is wrong, and the theory of "quick victory" is groundless. The War of Resistance Against Japan is a protracted war, and the final victory belongs to China.

In his famous work "On Protracted War," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in the war, the Chinese and Japanese sides have the following mutually contradictory characteristics: Japan is an imperialist strong country; however, Japanese imperialism is in a dying and declining era, and the war it launched is aggressive, retrograde, and barbaric; it lacks manpower and material resources and cannot endure a long war; internationally, it is isolated and lacks support. China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal weak country; however, China is in a progressive era in history, and the war it is waging is anti-aggression, progressive, and just; China has the manpower and material resources to support a long war; internationally, it has the sympathy and support of a wide range of people. These are all the basic elements of the Chinese-Japanese war.

Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that these elements will play a role in the course of the war. Japan's strengths are temporary and will gradually weaken due to our efforts. Japan's weaknesses are fundamental and cannot be overcome and will gradually expand in the war. China's weaknesses are temporary and will gradually be overcome. China's strengths are fundamental and will gradually play an active role in the war. Japan's strengths and China's weaknesses determine that China cannot achieve a quick victory. China's strengths and Japan's weaknesses determine that Japan must be defeated, and the final victory belongs to China.

Based on this analysis, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated the strategic policy of protracted war. That is to say, China's war of resistance is a long-term one and must go through a long period of effort to gradually weaken the enemy, strengthen itself, turn the enemy from strong to weak, and turn oneself from weak to strong, accumulating enough strength to finally defeat the enemy. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that with the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves, the War of Resistance Against Japan will go through the three stages of strategic defense, strategic stalemate, and strategic counterattack. The process of protracted war is also the process of mobilizing the people, organizing the people, and arming the people. Only by mobilizing the whole people to wage a people's war can we persist in the war of resistance and defeat the Japanese invaders.

To make the War of Resistance Against Japan a genuine people's war, our Party insisted on relying on the broad masses of the people, uniting all anti-Japanese forces that could be united, consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front. Our Party's basic line was: to mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces, and under the leadership of our Party, defeat the invaders and build a new China.

The War of Resistance Against Japan was a historical stage of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Our Party's line in the War of Resistance Against Japan was not only to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan but also to lay the foundation for the victory of the New Democratic Revolution throughout the country. Only by completing the New Democratic Revolution can the Socialist Revolution be carried out. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Democratic revolution and Socialist revolution, 'two articles, the upper and lower parts, only if the upper part is done well, the lower part can be done well. Firmly leading the democratic revolution is the condition for winning the victory of socialism.'"

Concretely analyzing concrete things and concretely solving concrete contradictions is the living soul of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong, in the midst of complex contradictions, grasped the main contradiction, concretely analyzed the two aspects of the main contradiction, and smoothly solved the problem of how to recognize and deal with various contradictions.

It was on this basis of scientific analysis that Comrade Mao Zedong correctly formulated the political and military lines of people's war during the War of Resistance Against Japan, further developed the idea of building rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities, and formulated a series of policies, strategies, and tactics for implementing people's war in the political, military, economic, and cultural fields, thus ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and preparing the conditions for the victory of the New Democratic Revolution throughout the country.

Correctly implementing the line and policy of the united front

To win the victory of people's war, it is necessary to establish the broadest united front and have a series of policies that can both fully mobilize the basic masses and unite all forces that can be united.

The anti-Japanese national united front included all anti-Japanese classes and strata. These classes and strata have a common interest in resisting Japan, which is the basis for unity. However, the anti-Japanese firmness of these classes and strata is different, and they have class contradictions and different conflicts of interest among themselves. This makes class struggle within the united front inevitable.

When formulating the Party's line of the anti-Japanese national united front, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the various classes in our society as follows:

Workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie are firmly demanding to fight to the end, they are the main force in resisting Japan and are the basic masses demanding unity and progress.

The bourgeoisie is divided into the national bourgeoisie and the comprador bourgeoisie. In the bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie is relatively numerous, they are relatively weak, often waver, and have contradictions with the workers, but they have a certain degree of anti-imperialist activism and are our allies in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The comprador bourgeoisie is the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, they are few in number but occupy the ruling position in China. They are respectively dependent on different imperialists, with pro-Japanese factions and pro-British and American factions. The pro-Japanese comprador bourgeoisie is the capitulationist and is an open or hidden traitor. The pro-British and American comprador bourgeoisie, to a certain extent, supports anti-Japanese resistance but is not firm and wants to compromise with Japan. They are essentially anti-communist and anti-people.

Landlords are divided into large, medium, and small. Some large landlords have become traitors. Other large landlords support anti-Japanese resistance but are very wavering. Many medium and small landlords have demands for anti-Japanese resistance but have contradictions with the peasants.

Facing such complex class relations, our Party's policy within the united front is to unite and struggle. That is, to unite all anti-Japanese classes and strata, even if they are wavering and temporary allies, they should be won over, and appropriate policies should be adopted to adjust the mutual relations between various anti-Japanese classes and strata, making them adapt to the overall task of anti-Japanese resistance. At the same time, we insist on the principle of independence and self-reliance of our Party, putting our work focus on fully mobilizing the masses and strengthening the people's forces, and struggling against all actions that are not conducive to the war of resistance, unity, and progress.

Our Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front is different from Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist policy of all unity and denying struggle, and also different from Wang Ming's "left" opportunist policy of all struggle and denying unity. Our Party has summed up the errors of right and "left" opportunism and formed the policy of both unity and struggle.

To unite all anti-Japanese parties and strata, including the Kuomintang, to resist Japan, our Party made a series of policy adjustments. We declared that we were fighting for the thorough realization of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. The government of our Shaan-Gan-Ning revolutionary base area was renamed the Special Administrative Region of the Republic of China. Our army changed from the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army. Our land policy changed from confiscating the land of landlords to reducing rent and interest. In the base area, we implemented the "three-thirds" system of power, absorbing representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and Kuomintang members who advocated anti-Japanese resistance but were not anti-communist. Other policies in the economic, tax, labor wages, anti-spy, people's rights, and cultural education fields were also changed accordingly and appropriately based on the principles of the anti-Japanese national united front.

While making these policy adjustments, we insisted on the independence of the Communist Party, the people's army, and the base areas. We also insisted that the Kuomintang must implement national mobilization, reform political institutions, open up democracy, improve people's lives, arm the people, and achieve a comprehensive war of resistance. We firmly struggled against the Kuomintang's passive resistance, active anti-communism, suppression of the people's anti-Japanese movement, and the conspiracy of compromise and capitulation.

Historical experience tells us that after our Party corrected the rightist errors, it is easy to produce "leftist" errors; after our Party corrected the "leftist" errors, it is easy to produce rightist errors. When we break with the Kuomintang ruling clique, it is easy to produce "leftist" errors; when we unite with the Kuomintang ruling clique, it is easy to produce rightist errors.

After opposing "left" opportunism and establishing the anti-Japanese national united front, the main danger within our Party was right-opportunism, that is, capitulationism.

In the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Wang Ming, as the representative of "left" opportunism, in the early period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, turned to the other extreme and became the representative of right-opportunism, that is, capitulationism. Wang Ming used a thoroughgoing capitulationist line and a series of extreme rightist policies to oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line and policies. He voluntarily gave up the leadership of the proletariat in the anti-Japanese national united front and handed over this leadership to the Kuomintang. He advocated "everything through the united front" and "everything subordinated to the united front," which in reality meant everything through and subordinated to Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. He opposed mobilizing the masses, opposed implementing democratic reforms, opposed improving the lives of workers and peasants, and undermined the foundation of the united front, the worker-peasant alliance. He did not want the revolutionary forces led by the Communist Party to have a base area and wanted the revolutionary forces to become kites without strings. He did not want the people's army led by the Communist Party and wanted to hand over the people's arms, that is, everything of the people, to Chiang Kai-shek. He did not want the leadership of the Communist Party and advocated the alliance of young people from the two parties to adapt to Chiang Kai-shek's plan to dissolve the Communist Party. He himself "dressed up and went to the door," hoping to be awarded a position. Wang Ming's whole set of revisionism, if carried out according to this revisionist line and policy, the Chinese people would not be able to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, let alone the later national victory.

Wang Ming's revisionist line, for a period of time during the War of Resistance Against Japan, had caused damage to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. However, Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position had already been established in our Party Central Committee. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, all Marxist-Leninists in the Party resolutely struggled against Wang Ming's errors and corrected this error in time. This prevented Wang Ming's erroneous line from causing greater harm to the Party's cause over a longer period.

Chiang Kai-shek, this negative teacher, helped us correct Wang Ming's errors. Chiang Kai-shek, using cannons and machine guns, repeatedly gave us lessons. The most serious one was the Anqing Incident in January 1941. The New Fourth Army stationed in Anqing, due to the violation of the Party Central Committee's instructions by individual leaders, executed Wang Ming's revisionist line, and suffered heavy losses in the face of Chiang Kai-shek's sudden attack. Many heroic revolutionary fighters were massacred by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The lesson of blood made many of our comrades sober-minded, and the ability to distinguish between the correct line and the erroneous line was enhanced.

Comrade Mao Zedong continuously summed up the experience of the whole Party in implementing and executing the anti-Japanese national united front and formulated a series of policies in time, mainly:

First, all anti-Japanese people (workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants) unite to form an anti-Japanese national united front.

Second, the policy of independence within the united front, both unity and independence are needed.

Third, in military strategy, it is an independent guerrilla war under the strategic unity, basically guerrilla warfare, but not neglecting mobile warfare under favorable conditions.

Fourth, in struggling against the anti-communist diehards led by Chiang Kai-shek, it is to use contradictions, win over the majority, oppose the minority, and defeat them one by one; it is to be reasonable, beneficial, and restrained.

Fifth, in the policy towards the areas occupied by Japan and the areas controlled by the Kuomintang, it is to develop the work of the united front as much as possible on the one hand, and to adopt the policy of hidden and compact organization on the other; it is to adopt the policy of hidden and compact organization, long-term concealment, accumulation of strength, and waiting for the opportunity in terms of organizational form and struggle method.

Sixth, in the basic policy towards the mutual relations of various classes within the country, it is to develop progressive forces, win over intermediate forces, and isolate anti-communist diehard forces.

Seventh, in the revolutionary two-faced policy towards anti-communist diehards, it is to adopt the policy of uniting with their reluctant anti-Japanese side and struggling against and isolating their resolute anti-communist side.

Eighth, for landlords and the bourgeoisie, even for large landlords and the big bourgeoisie, they should be analyzed and distinguished. Based on these distinctions, various different policies should be established to achieve the purpose of uniting all forces that can be united.

The line and various policies of the anti-Japanese national united front formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong have been proven completely correct through the test of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

History has proven that the Communist Party, in the face of the ferocious aggression of imperialism, must hold high the banner of nationalism and use the weapon of the united front to unite more than 90% of the people of the country and all patriotic and anti-imperialist people to mobilize all active factors to the maximum extent, unite all forces that can be united to the maximum extent, and isolate the common enemy of the nation to the maximum extent. If the banner of nationalism is abandoned and the line of sectarianism is adopted, making oneself isolated, then there is no question of leadership, no question of developing the revolutionary cause of the people, and in objective terms, it is helping the enemy and leading to failure.

History has proven that the Communist Party must insist on the independence of thought, politics, and organization within the united front, insist on the principle of independence and self-reliance, and insist on leadership. Because there are class differences among the various classes participating in the united front, the Party must adopt correct policies to develop progressive forces, win over intermediate forces, and oppose diehard forces. The focus of the Party's work should be on developing progressive forces and strengthening the revolutionary forces of the people. Only in this way can the united front be maintained and strengthened. "Struggling for unity is to preserve unity, yielding for unity is to lose unity," this is our main experience in struggling against diehard forces. History has proven that in the national democratic revolution, the united front must include two alliances. The first alliance is the worker-peasant alliance. The second alliance is the alliance of the working people with the bourgeoisie and other non-working people. The worker-peasant alliance is the alliance between the working class and the peasants and all urban and rural working people, which is the foundation of the united front. Whether the working class can seize the leadership in the national democratic revolution depends on whether it can lead the peasants to struggle and unite the broad masses of peasants around itself. The working class can only seize the leadership of the peasants and, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, form the second alliance and form a broad united front. Only in this way can the people's war be successfully carried out. Otherwise, everything is a castle in the air, everything is talking on paper, everything is unreliable.

Rely on the peasants, build rural base areas

In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, peasants accounted for more than 80% of the total population. They suffered triple oppression and exploitation from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and had strong demands for anti-Japanese resistance and revolution. To achieve victory in the people's war, it is necessary to rely mainly on the peasants.

Many comrades in our Party did not recognize this problem from the beginning. In the history of our Party, in the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, one of the main errors of the right-opportunist Chen Duxiu was that they did not recognize the importance of the peasant problem and opposed mobilizing and arming the peasants. In the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, one of the main errors of the "left" opportunist Wang Ming was also that they did not recognize the importance of the peasant problem and did not recognize the importance of long-term hard work in the peasants and the establishment of revolutionary base areas in the countryside, but fantasized about quickly seizing large cities and quickly achieving revolutionary victory throughout the country. The errors of right opportunism and "left" opportunism brought serious setbacks and failures to the Chinese revolution.

As early as the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the peasant problem occupies an extremely important position in the Chinese revolution. The bourgeois democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism is essentially a peasant revolution. Leading the struggle of the peasants is the basic task of the Chinese proletariat in the bourgeois democratic revolution.

In the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong again emphasized that peasants are the most reliable and broadest allies of the proletariat and are the main force in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The source of the army is mainly peasants. The financial and material resources needed for a long war are mainly from the peasants. The War of Resistance Against Japan must mainly rely on the peasants and mobilize the peasants as widely as possible to participate.

The War of Resistance Against Japan was essentially a peasant revolutionary war led by our Party. Our Party mobilized and organized the peasant masses, combining the proletariat with the peasants, thus forming an invincible force to defeat any strong enemy.

Relying on the peasants, building rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities, this is the victorious path that the Chinese revolution has taken.

Based on the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the importance of establishing rural revolutionary base areas. He said: "Because the powerful imperialists and their reactionary allies in China always occupy the central cities of China for a long time, if the revolutionary forces do not want to compromise with imperialism and its running dogs but want to fight persistently, if the revolutionary forces want to prepare to accumulate and temper their own strength and avoid decisive battles with strong enemies when their strength is not enough, then they must turn the backward countryside into an advanced and solid base area, into a great revolutionary stronghold in military, political, economic, and cultural terms, to counter the ferocious enemy who uses cities to attack rural areas, to gradually achieve the complete victory of the revolution in the long-term struggle."

The experience of the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War proved that if we acted according to Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic idea, the revolutionary forces developed greatly and established one red base area after another. On the contrary, if we went against Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic idea and implemented the "left" opportunist line, the revolutionary forces suffered serious damage, losing almost 100% in the cities and 90% in the countryside.

In the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese imperialist army occupied many large cities and main transportation routes in China, but its strength was insufficient and could not occupy the vast countryside. The countryside remained the weak link in the enemy's rule. This provided greater possibilities for the establishment of rural base areas. Soon after the War of Resistance Against Japan began, when the Japanese army was surging into the interior of China and the Kuomintang army was retreating step by step, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, under the wise decision of Comrade Mao Zedong, divided into many detachments and bravely advanced to the enemy's rear, establishing base areas in the vast countryside. During the eight years of the war of resistance, we successively established nineteen anti-Japanese base areas in North China, Central China, and South China. Except for large cities and main transportation routes, the vast areas behind the enemy lines were all under the control of the people.

In the anti-Japanese base areas, we implemented democratic reforms, improved the lives of the people, and mobilized and organized the broad masses of peasants. In each base area, anti-Japanese democratic governments were widely established, and the people gained the democratic rights of self-governance; at the same time, the "reasonable burden" policy and the "rent reduction and interest reduction" policy were implemented to weaken the feudal exploitation system and improve the lives of the people. In this way, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses was greatly enhanced, and various anti-Japanese strata were taken care of and united. When formulating the various policies of the base areas, we also considered the convenience of developing work in the enemy-occupied areas.

For the cities and villages occupied by the enemy, we combined legal struggle with illegal struggle, united the basic masses and all patriots there, split and disintegrated the enemy puppet government, and prepared to strike the enemy in conjunction with the outside when the conditions were ripe.

The base areas established by our Party became the center of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese and national salvation. Relying on these base areas, our Party developed and strengthened the revolutionary forces of the people, persisted in the long-term war of resistance, and achieved the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Of course, the development of the revolutionary base areas would not be smooth. Such revolutionary base areas are a great threat to the enemy, and the enemy will definitely come to attack. The development of the base areas cannot be without the process of expansion, contraction, and re-expansion. From 1937 to 1940, the anti-Japanese base areas had developed to have a population of one hundred million. However, from 1941 to 1942, Japanese imperialism mobilized most of its troops in China to fiercely attack and ruthlessly destroy our base areas. At the same time, the Kuomintang also implemented encirclement, blockade, and even military attacks on our base areas. By 1942, the anti-Japanese base areas had shrunk to have a population of less than fifty million. Our Party fully relied on the masses of the people, resolutely adopted a series of correct policies and measures, making the base areas able to persist even in extremely difficult conditions. After this setback, the military and civilians of the base areas were tempered to be even stronger. From 1943 onwards, our base areas gradually recovered and expanded, and by 1945, they had developed to have a population of one hundred and sixty million. In the entire process of the Chinese revolution, the development of the revolutionary base areas experienced many ups and downs and withstood many tests, gradually developing from small and fragmented base areas to large and contiguous base areas, advancing in waves.

The process of building revolutionary base areas was also a great rehearsal for preparing for national victory. In the base areas, we built the Party, built the government, built the people's armed forces, built mass organizations, built industrial and agricultural production, built cultural education, and built everything necessary for the independent survival of a region. Our base areas were actually the embryo of the state. With the gradual development of the construction of the base areas, our Party tempered a powerful people's army, cultivated cadres for various types of work, accumulated experience in various types of work, accumulated material and spiritual strength, thus preparing favorable conditions for national victory.

The revolutionary base areas established during the War of Resistance Against Japan became the starting point for the Chinese people to wage the War of Liberation to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the War of Liberation, we still followed the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing the cities, achieving national victory.

Building a new type of people's army

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." This is the conclusion drawn by Comrade Mao Zedong from the experience of the Chinese people's long-term revolutionary struggle in which they exchanged blood for. This is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism.

The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is that armed revolution opposes armed counter-revolution, the main form of struggle is war, and the main organizational form is the army under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. All other organizations and struggles led by our Party are directly or indirectly coordinated with the war.

In the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, many excellent comrades of the Communist Party of China actively participated in the revolutionary armed struggle. However, at that time, our Party was still in its infancy and did not clearly recognize the characteristics of the Chinese revolution. After the First Domestic Revolutionary War, when the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, killed a large number of communists, and destroyed all revolutionary mass organizations, our Party gradually recognized the extreme importance of organizing revolutionary armed forces and studying the strategies and tactics of revolutionary war, and created the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which was the first people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

In the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army created by Comrade Mao Zedong had developed greatly, reaching three hundred thousand. However, later, due to the leadership of "left" opportunism, the implementation of erroneous political and military lines, the Red Army suffered a loss of nine-tenths.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's army led by the Communist Party of China had only forty thousand people. The Kuomintang reactionaries used every means to try to restrict, weaken, and annihilate this people's army. In this situation, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that to persist in the war of resistance and defeat the Japanese invaders, it was necessary to greatly expand and consolidate the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all guerrilla forces led by our Party. The whole Party should pay attention to the war and learn military affairs. Every Party member should be ready to go to the front line at any time.

Comrade Mao Zedong also sharply pointed out that Communist Party members do not compete for personal military power, but they must compete for the military power of the Party, for the military power of the people.

Under the correct guidance of the Party's policy of strengthening revolutionary armed forces, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and other anti-Japanese guerrilla forces led by our Party, from the beginning of the war, quickly rushed to the front lines of the war of resistance. We spread the sparks of people's arms to the vast enemy-occupied areas, and everywhere the flames of guerrilla war were ignited. Our people's army, in the war, continuously developed and strengthened, and by the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it had become a million-strong army and had more than two million militia. It was precisely because of this that in the War of Resistance Against Japan, we resisted 64% of the invading Japanese army and 95% of the puppet army, becoming the main force in the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan. While resisting the Japanese invaders, we also repelled the three waves of anti-communist campaigns launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1939, 1941, and 1943, and smashed countless "frictions" they initiated.

Why could the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, in the War of Resistance Against Japan, grow from small to large and from weak to strong, and achieve great victories?

The fundamental reason is that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were built according to Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought. This is a new type of people's army that serves the people wholeheartedly.

According to Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought of the people's army, our army is an army under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. It loyally implements the Marxist-Leninist line and policies of the Party. It has a high degree of self-awareness of discipline, has the heroic spirit of overcoming all enemies and not fearing any difficulties. Within the army, the cadres and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, various work departments, and various brotherly units are completely united. Outside the army, the army and the people, the army and the local government are also completely united.

Our army, in the War of Resistance Against Japan, resolutely implemented the three major tasks of fighting, doing mass work, and engaging in production prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong, being both a fighting force, a working force, and a productive force. They spread propaganda to the masses, organized the masses, armed the masses, and helped the masses establish revolutionary governments everywhere. They strictly observed the three major disciplines and eight items for attention, carried out the movement of supporting the government and loving the people, and did good things for the masses everywhere. Our army also made use of every possible means to engage in production by themselves, thus overcoming economic difficulties, improving the life of the army, and reducing the burden on the people. Our army thus won the heartfelt support of the masses of the people with its model actions and was affectionately called "our children" by the broad masses of the people.

Our army not only has its main force but also has its local forces and vigorously established and developed militia organizations, implementing the system of combining the main force, local forces, and militia.

Our army also has the correct policy of winning over enemy soldiers and officers and treating prisoners of war leniently. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, we not only won over a large number of puppet soldiers to surrender and rebel but also educated a number of Japanese soldiers who were deeply poisoned by fascist ideology. After raising their awareness, they organized the Japanese People's Liberation Alliance, the Anti-War Alliance of Japanese in China, the Awakening Alliance, and other organizations, cooperating with us to disintegrate the Japanese army and fighting together against Japanese militarism.

The basic spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought is that the construction of the people's army should emphasize politics, and first and foremost, build the army politically. Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of our army. Although the people's army should also pay attention to continuously improving weapons and equipment and raising military technology, the people's army fights not only with weapons and technology but more importantly with politics, with the revolutionary consciousness and bravery of the soldiers and officers, and with the support of the masses of the people.

Because we implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's military line, this army was able to always keep the political consciousness of the proletariat high, make the atmosphere of learning Mao Zedong Thought thick, make the morale high, make the unity good, and make the hatred for the enemy deep, thus producing great spiritual power. When fighting, they are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, can charge when charging, and can defend when defending. One person can be used as several people, several tens of people, several hundred people, and all kinds of miracles in the world can be created.

All these made the people's army led by the Communist Party of China fundamentally different from the bourgeois army and different from all the old armies that served the exploiting classes and were driven and used by a few people. The practical experience of the Chinese people's war proved that the people's army built according to Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought is invincible and unconquerable.

Implementing the strategic and tactical principles of people's war

Engels said: "The liberation of the proletariat will also have its own military manifestation and will create its own special, new methods of warfare." The Chinese people's revolutionary war led by the Communist Party of China realized this great prophecy of Engels. In the long-term armed struggle, we created a set of people's war strategies and tactics that could attack the enemy's weaknesses with our strengths.

In the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, based on the analysis of the situation on both sides, Comrade Mao Zedong determined that the strategic policy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by our Party was: "The basic principle is guerrilla warfare, but not neglecting mobile warfare under favorable conditions." Comrade Mao Zedong elevated guerrilla warfare to the strategic position because: under the condition of a great disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, the revolutionary armed forces must not engage in a frontal confrontation with the enemy; otherwise, they will suffer heavy losses, and the revolution will suffer heavy setbacks. Only by implementing guerrilla warfare can the full strength of the people be mobilized and highly utilized to fight against the enemy, can the forces be developed and strengthened in the war, can the enemy be worn down and weakened, and can the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves be gradually changed, from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, and finally completely defeat the enemy.

The "ten-character formula" of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in the early period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War is the basic tactic of guerrilla warfare. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, guerrilla tactics were further developed. The military and civilians in the enemy-occupied areas, regardless of gender and age, fought independently, and villages fought independently, creating various clever fighting methods such as sparrow warfare, landmine warfare, trench warfare, sabotage warfare, and water guerrilla warfare.

By the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the period of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, with the change in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, our strategic policy changed from mainly guerrilla warfare to mainly mobile warfare. By the mid and late period of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, our operations had developed into large-scale mobile warfare, including the siege of large cities.

Annihilation warfare is the basic guiding ideology of our operations. Whether it is mainly mobile warfare or mainly guerrilla warfare, this guiding ideology should be implemented. In guerrilla warfare, although many sabotage and harassment tasks should be executed, it is still necessary to actively advocate and strive to implement annihilation warfare under all favorable conditions. In mobile warfare, it is required that each battle must concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The battle of annihilation, for any enemy, immediately has a great impact. For the people, it is better to cut off one finger than to injure ten fingers; for the enemy, it is better to annihilate one regiment than to rout ten regiments." Only annihilation warfare can most effectively strike the enemy, making the enemy suffer a loss of one regiment less one regiment, one battalion less one battalion, making the enemy's morale collapse, and making the enemy disintegrate internally. Implementing annihilation warfare, our army captures something in every battle, morale is higher and higher, the troops are bigger and bigger, weapons are better and better, and combat effectiveness is stronger and stronger.

In his famous ten military principles, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Each battle should concentrate absolutely superior forces (two times, three times, four times, sometimes even five times or six times the enemy's forces), surround the enemy on all sides, and strive for complete annihilation, not letting any escape. In special circumstances, the method of giving the enemy a crushing blow should be adopted, that is, concentrating all forces to strike the enemy's front and one or both wings, aiming to annihilate part of the enemy and rout another part, so that our army can quickly transfer forces to annihilate other enemy forces. We should avoid fighting that kind of battle that is not worth the loss or is a draw. In this way, in general, we are inferior (in terms of quantity), but in each part and in each specific battle, we are absolutely superior, which guarantees the victory of the battle. With the passage of time, we will turn to be superior in general, until we annihilate all enemies." He also pointed out that we should first attack the dispersed and isolated enemy, and then attack the concentrated and strong enemy, striving to annihilate the enemy in motion. We should not fight unprepared battles or battles without confidence. In battle, we should develop our army's special strengths and excellent combat style. These are the main principles of fighting annihilation warfare.

To annihilate the enemy, we must adopt the policy of luring the enemy in, actively and plannedly abandoning some cities and places, and letting the enemy in to fight. Only by letting the enemy in, the people can participate in the battle with various actions, and the power of people's war can be maximized. Only by letting the enemy in, the enemy can be forced to disperse its forces, carry its burden, and make mistakes, that is, let the enemy be happy, let the enemy's ten fingers all stretch out, let the enemy's two feet all sink in the mud. In this way, we can concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one. Only by annihilating the enemy's combat effectiveness can we finally defend or seize cities and places. That kind of fear of losing places, fear of breaking pots and pans, and dividing forces to guard every mouth and resisting everywhere is a method we firmly oppose. It cannot annihilate the enemy, nor can it defend cities and places, and this method is what we firmly oppose.

Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the strategic and tactical principles of people's war in four sentences, called: "You fight your way, I fight my way; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat."

That is to say, you rely on modern weapons, I rely on the people with high revolutionary consciousness; you show your strengths, I show my strengths; you have your own way of fighting, I have my own way of fighting. When you fight me, you can't hit me, you can't touch me. When I fight you, I must hit you, hit you accurately, eat you up. When I can eat you up, I eat you up; when I can't eat you up, I don't let you eat me up. Fighting when you can win is opportunism, fighting when you can't win is adventurism. All our strategic and tactical principles are established on the basis of this fundamental point of fighting. We admit that we must retreat, but it is on the condition that we must first admit that we must fight. All retreats are for the sake of fighting, for the sake of finally and thoroughly annihilating the enemy. This strategic and tactical principle can only be implemented by relying on the broad masses of the people. And implementing such a strategic and tactical principle can fully demonstrate the superiority of people's war. No matter what advantages the enemy has in technology and equipment, no matter what methods the enemy uses to deal with us, it can only be in a passive position of being beaten, and the initiative is always in our hands.

Because we implemented the strategic and tactical principles of people's war, we finally grew from small to large and from weak to strong, defeating the powerful enemies at home and abroad. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's army led by the Communist Party of China fought against the enemy more than 125,000 times and annihilated more than 1.7 million enemy and puppet troops. In the three years of the War of Liberation, we annihilated 800,000 Kuomintang reactionary troops and won the great victory of the people's revolution.

Insisting on the policy of self-reliance

The Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan was an important part of the world anti-fascist war. The victory of the entire anti-fascist war was the result of the joint struggle of the peoples of the world. In defeating Japanese imperialism, the Soviet army led by Comrade Stalin played an important role in the final stage of the war. The peoples of Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Burma, India, Pakistan, Malaya, the Philippines, Thailand, and other Asian countries also made significant contributions. The peoples of America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa also made contributions.

The Japanese communists and revolutionary people of Japan, in extremely difficult conditions, also fought bravely and tenaciously, contributing their strength to the defeat of Japanese fascism.

Title: The Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War
Author:
Date: 1965-09-03
Edition: 2

The peoples of all countries support each other and inspire each other to achieve a common victory. However, the liberation of each country is primarily achieved through the efforts of its own people.

The victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan and the subsequent People's Liberation War received support from the peoples of other countries, but it was mainly achieved through the efforts of the Chinese people themselves. Some people even claim that the victory of the Chinese War of Resistance was entirely due to foreign aid. This absurd claim is identical to the rhetoric of Japanese militarism.

The principle that the people must liberate themselves is a fundamental tenet of Marxism-Leninism. The revolution of a country and the people's war of a country are primarily the responsibility of the people of that country and should mainly rely on the strength of the people of that country.

During the War of Resistance, our Party advocated that China should rely primarily on self-reliance while seeking as much foreign aid as possible. We firmly opposed the Nationalist Party's policy of relying entirely on foreign aid. In the eyes of Chiang Kai-shek, China was incapable in every way—industry, agriculture, and military equipment. To defeat Japan, he believed, China had to rely on foreign countries, especially the imperialism of the United States and Britain. This was a slavish mentality. Our policy was the opposite of the Nationalist Party's. We believed that the contradictions between American and British imperialism and Japanese imperialism could be utilized, but we could not rely on them. In fact, American and British imperialism had repeatedly engaged in "Far Eastern Munich" plots, attempting to sacrifice China and compromise with Japanese imperialism. For a considerable period, they even provided war materials to the Japanese invaders. The aid provided by American imperialism during the War of Resistance also contained sinister intentions, aiming to turn China into its colony.

Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The Chinese War of Resistance relies mainly on self-reliance." "We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creativity of all our soldiers and civilians."

For the people's army and the liberated areas under the leadership of our Party, self-reliance is particularly important.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Nationalist government still provided some salary to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, but later, they gave nothing. The fierce attacks and ruthless sweeps of Japanese imperialism, the military encirclement and economic blockade of the Nationalist Party, and natural disasters all caused severe difficulties in the liberated areas. Especially in 1941 and 1942, we almost had no clothes to wear and no food to eat.

What should we do? Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Since ancient times, how have humans lived? They have relied on their own efforts to survive. Why can't we, the descendants of humans, have this wisdom? Why can't we rely on our own efforts?"

The people of the liberated areas, following the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's directive of "self-reliance, clothing and food in abundance," and "developing the economy to ensure supply," launched a large-scale production movement with agriculture as the main focus.

Difficulties are not insurmountable monsters. Everyone working together to overcome them will make them surrender. The Nationalist reactionaries thought that by not providing us with salaries and implementing an economic blockade, they could starve us out. In fact, they helped us by forcing us to rely on our own efforts to overcome difficulties. On one hand, we launched a large-scale production movement, and on the other, we implemented strict military and administrative austerity, conserving manpower and resources. This not only overcame the severe material difficulties and successfully crossed the difficult period but also reduced the burden on the people and improved their lives, laying the material foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance.

In terms of solving the problem of weapons and equipment, we also manufactured some weapons ourselves, but mainly relied on seizing the enemy's weapons to equip ourselves. Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese imperialists, and the American imperialists all served as our "transportation corps." The armories of imperialism always provide weapons for the oppressed peoples and nations.

Whether in the more than eight years of the War of Resistance or the more than three years of the People's Liberation War, the people's army led by our Party always conducted large-scale people's wars independently, without external material aid, and achieved great victories.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that our fundamental policy is to rely on our own strength. Only by relying on self-reliance can we stand unshakable in any situation.

In the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, the peoples of all countries always support each other. Countries that have already won should have the obligation to support and aid those that have not yet won. However, no matter what, external aid can only play an auxiliary role.

To make a revolution, to conduct a people's war, and to achieve victory, one must adhere to the policy of self-reliance and rely on the strength of the people of one's own country, preparing to conduct the struggle independently even if all external material aid is cut off. If one does not strive and think and solve one's own country's revolutionary problems independently, relying on the strength of the people of one's own country, but instead relies solely on foreign aid, even if it is the aid of a country that firmly supports the revolution, one will not be able to achieve victory, and even if one does achieve victory, it will not be solid. Even if one relies on the aid of a socialist country that firmly supports the revolution, it will not be able to achieve victory, and even if one does achieve victory, it will not be solid.

The international significance of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war

The Chinese Revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution. The path of the October Revolution is the common path of the revolutionary peoples of the world. The Chinese Revolution and the October Revolution share the following basic points: First, both are led by the working class with the Communist Party as the core, guided by Marxism-Leninism. Second, both are based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Third, both seize power through violent revolution and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Fourth, both establish a socialist system after the revolution's victory. Fifth, both are part of the world proletarian revolution.

Of course, the Chinese Revolution has its own characteristics. The October Revolution took place in imperialist Russia, while the Chinese Revolution took place in a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. The October Revolution was a socialist revolution of the proletariat, while the Chinese Revolution was a new democratic revolution that turned into a socialist revolution after achieving complete victory. The October Revolution was a city-based armed uprising that then spread to the countryside; the Chinese Revolution was a countryside-based revolution that eventually surrounded the cities and achieved national victory.

The great contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong lies in his combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese Revolution and, based on the long-term revolutionary struggle experience of the Chinese people, highly summarizing and generalizing it, enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, after being tested by the long-term practice of the Chinese Revolution, has proven to be in accordance with the objective laws of people's war and invincible. It is not only applicable to China but also a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

The people's war led by the Chinese Communist Party, including the War of Resistance and the domestic revolutionary war, lasted for twenty-two years, making it the longest, most complex, and most experienced people's war led by the proletariat in the world today.

The theory of proletarian revolution by Marxism-Leninism ultimately is the theory of seizing power by revolutionary violence, the theory of using people's war to counter anti-people's war. Marx said well: "Violence is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one."

Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the experience of the Chinese people's war, proposed in the most popular and vivid language the famous proposition: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

War is the product of imperialism and the exploitative system. Lenin said, "War, wherever and whenever it occurs, is always initiated by the exploiting, ruling, and oppressing classes." As long as imperialism and the exploitative system exist, imperialism and reactionaries will always rely on armed forces to maintain their reactionary rule and impose war on the oppressed nations and peoples. This is an objective law that is not subject to human will.

In today's world, imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, without exception, are strengthening their state machinery, especially their armies. American imperialism is even more aggressively conducting armed invasions and armed suppressions everywhere.

In the face of the invasion and suppression of imperialism and its lackeys, what should the oppressed nations and peoples do? Should they kneel and become slaves forever? Or should they rise up and fight for liberation?

Comrade Mao Zedong vividly answered this question. He said, the Chinese people, through long-term investigation and research, found that imperialism and its lackeys, "all have knives in their hands and want to kill people. The people understood and did the same."

In the final analysis, in the face of the armed invasion and suppression of imperialism and its lackeys, whether to dare to engage in a head-on struggle, whether to dare to conduct a people's war, is the question of whether to dare to make a revolution. This question is the most reliable touchstone for testing whether one is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, a true Marxist-Leninist or a false Marxist-Leninist.

In response to some people's cowardly thoughts of fearing imperialism and reactionaries, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the famous proposition that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." He said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They look terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

The history of the people's war in China and other countries has powerfully proven: the revolutionary forces of the people, from weak to strong, from small to large, is a universal law of class struggle, a universal law of people's war. The development process of people's war, although it will inevitably encounter many difficulties, twists, and turns, and failures, but the inevitable trend of the victory of people's war is something that no force can change.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that one must strategically despise the enemy and tactically take the enemy seriously.

Strategically despising the enemy is the minimum requirement for a revolutionary. If one does not have the heroic spirit of despising the enemy and daring to win, one cannot even talk about revolution, talk about conducting people's war, let alone winning.

Tactically taking the enemy seriously is also very important for revolutionaries. If one does not take the enemy seriously in tactics, in the specific practices of the revolution of each country, in each specific struggle issue, if one does not study the specific situation, does not adopt a cautious attitude, does not pay attention to the art of struggle, does not adopt appropriate forms of struggle, people's war will not be able to achieve victory.

Dialectical materialism and historical materialism tell us: the most important thing is not the seemingly solid but already decaying things of the present, but the things that are emerging and developing, even if they seem not solid at present, because only the things that are emerging and developing are invincible.

Why do seemingly weak new forces always defeat the seemingly strong decaying forces? Because the truth is on their side, the people are on their side. While the reactionary class always separates itself from the people and opposes the people.

The victory of the Chinese Revolution has proven this. The history of all revolutions, the entire history of class struggle, and the entire history of humanity have also proven this.

Imperialists are extremely afraid of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Revisionists are extremely hostile to this theory. They all oppose and attack this theory. Some mediocre people also mock this theory. However, all of these cannot diminish the value of this theory. The light of truth is something that no one can cover up.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war not only solves the problem of daring to conduct people's war but also solves the problem of how to conduct people's war.

Comrade Mao Zedong is a great politician and military strategist who is good at guiding wars according to the laws of war. The line, policy, strategy, and tactics of people's war formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong have guided the Chinese people, in extremely complex and difficult situations, to circumvent all the reefs in the course of advancement and sail the ship of people's war to the shore of victory.

It must be emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of establishing rural revolutionary bases and surrounding the cities with the countryside has outstanding and universal significance for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world today, especially for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and its lackeys.

Now, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, many countries and peoples are suffering from severe invasions and enslavement by imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys. The political and economic basic conditions of many of these countries are similar to those of old China. The peasant question in these countries, like in China, is extremely important. Peasants are the main force in the national democratic revolution against imperialism and its lackeys. When imperialism invades these countries, it always first occupies large cities and transportation routes, but the vast countryside is something it cannot completely control. The countryside, and only the countryside, is the vast expanse where revolutionaries can roam freely. The countryside, and only the countryside, is the revolutionary base for the final march to victory. It is precisely for this reason that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of establishing rural revolutionary bases and surrounding the cities with the countryside has attracted more and more attention among the peoples of these regions.

From a global perspective, if North America and Western Europe are the "cities of the world," then Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the "countryside of the world." After the Second World War, the proletarian revolutionary movement in the capitalist countries of North America and Western Europe was temporarily delayed for various reasons, while the people's revolutionary movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America flourished. Today's world revolution, in a certain sense, is also a situation of the countryside surrounding the cities. The entire world revolutionary cause will ultimately depend on the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who make up the absolute majority of the world's population. Socialist countries should regard supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their internationalist responsibility.

The October Revolution opened a new era for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations. The victory of the October Revolution built a bridge between the proletarian socialist revolution in the West and the national democratic revolution in the colonies and semi-colonies of the East. The Chinese Revolution solved the problem of how to connect the national democratic revolution with the socialist revolution in a colonial and semi-colonial country.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that after the October Revolution, in any colonial and semi-colonial country, if a revolution against imperialism occurs, it is no longer part of the old bourgeois and capitalist world revolution but part of the new world revolution, that is, the proletarian socialist world revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the complete theory of the new democratic revolution. He pointed out that the new democratic revolution is not any other revolution; it must be and can only be a revolution led by the proletariat, a revolution of the people, a revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

This means that this revolution cannot be led by any other class or any other party; it must be and can only be led by the proletariat and the truly revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism.

This means that the participants in this revolution include not only workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie but also the national bourgeoisie and other anti-imperialist, patriotic, democratic personages.

This means that the enemies this revolution must oppose are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

The future of the new democratic revolution is socialism, not capitalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of the new democratic revolution is both the stage theory of Marxism-Leninism and the theory of continuous revolution of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Mao Zedong correctly distinguished between the two stages of national democratic revolution and socialist revolution while correctly linking them together. The national democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the development trend of the national democratic revolution. These two revolutionary stages are not separated by a great wall. However, only after completing the national democratic revolution can one talk about the socialist revolution. The more thorough the national democratic revolution is completed, the better it can create the conditions for the socialist revolution.

The experience of the Chinese Revolution shows: the tasks of the national democratic revolution need to be completed through long-term and repeated struggles. In this revolutionary stage, imperialism and its lackeys are the main enemies. In the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, one must unite the broadest possible anti-imperialist patriotic forces, including the national bourgeoisie and all patriotic personages. All participants in the anti-imperialist struggle from the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes are progressive in history, unacceptable to imperialism, and welcomed by the proletariat.

Confusing the two stages of national democratic revolution and socialist revolution is very harmful. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the erroneous view of "completing all tasks at once," pointing out that this fantasy can only weaken the most urgent struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. During the War of Resistance, the Nationalist reactionaries and their hired Trotskyites intentionally confused the two stages of the Chinese Revolution, advocating the so-called "single-stage revolution," aiming to implement the so-called "socialism without the Communist Party." They attempted to use this fallacy to swallow the Communist Party, completely eliminate any revolution, obstruct the progress of the national democratic revolution, and use it as an excuse for not opposing imperialism and surrendering to imperialism. This reactionary tune has long been buried by the history of the Chinese Revolution.

Now, the revisionists led by Khrushchev are vigorously advocating the fallacy that socialism can be achieved without the proletariat and without a truly revolutionary party armed with the advanced ideology of the proletariat. They have thrown the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to the winds. They spread this fallacy with the intention of diverting the anti-imperialist struggle of the oppressed nations, sabotaging the national democratic revolution, and serving imperialism.

The Chinese Revolution has provided successful experience in thoroughly conducting the national democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat and in timely transforming the national democratic revolution into the socialist revolution under the leadership of the proletariat.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the victory of the Chinese Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese Revolution, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism and adding new weapons to the arsenal of Marxism-Leninism.

Our era is an era in which world capitalism and imperialism are heading towards extinction, and socialism and communism are heading towards victory. Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war is not only a product of the Chinese Revolution but also bears the characteristics of the times. The new experiences of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries after the Second World War have repeatedly proven that Mao Zedong Thought is a common treasure of the revolutionary peoples of the world. This is the great international significance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Defeating American Imperialism and Its Lackeys with People's War

After the Second World War, American imperialism replaced the positions of German, Japanese, and Italian fascism, attempting to put the entire world under its slavery and control, aiming to establish an American empire. It actively supports Japanese militarism and West German militarism as its main helpers in launching a world war. It bullied and enslaved the peoples of various countries like a wolf, plundered the wealth of the peoples of various countries, invaded the sovereignty of other countries, and interfered in the internal affairs of other countries. It is the most arrogant invader in the history of humanity and the most vicious common enemy of the peoples of the world. All peoples and countries that want revolution, independence, and peace in the world cannot but direct the main thrust of their struggle against American imperialism.

Just as the policy of Japanese imperialism to annihilate China made it possible for the Chinese people to form the broadest possible united front to resist Japanese imperialism, now, American imperialism's policy of attempting to dominate the world also makes it possible for the peoples of the world to unite all possible forces, form the broadest possible united front, and concentrate on resisting American imperialism.

Now, with the peoples of the world on one side and American imperialism and its lackeys on the other, the main battlefield of the fierce struggle is in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the world, these regions are both the regions most deeply oppressed by imperialism and the regions where imperialist rule is the weakest. The increasingly high revolutionary tides that have emerged in these regions after the war are the most important forces directly striking American imperialism. The contradiction between the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and American imperialism led by the United States has become the main contradiction in the world today. The development of this main contradiction is driving the struggle of the peoples of the world against American imperialism and its lackeys.

After the Second World War, in the regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, people's war has increasingly shown its power. The peoples of China, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, Indonesia, Algeria, and other countries have all conducted people's wars against imperialism and its lackeys and achieved great victories. Although the leading classes of these people's wars are different, the breadth and depth of mobilizing the masses are different, and the degree of victory achieved is different, these victories of people's wars have greatly weakened and tied down the strength of imperialism, struck the plans of American imperialism to launch a world war, and become a powerful factor in defending world peace.

Today, the conditions for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to conduct people's wars against American imperialism and its lackeys are much more favorable than in the past.

After the Second World War and the subsequent years of revolutionary upsurge, the level of awareness and organization of the peoples of various countries has greatly improved, and the strength of mutual support among the peoples of various countries has greatly increased. The entire capitalist imperialist system has greatly weakened and is in a process of increasingly severe shocks and disintegration. If, after the First World War, imperialism could not eliminate the newly born socialist Soviet Union but could still suppress the revolutionary movements of some countries in their sphere of control and achieve a short period of relative stability, then, after the Second World War, imperialism not only cannot prevent a series of countries from taking the path of socialism but also cannot stop the surging tide of people's revolutionary movements in their sphere of control.

American imperialism is stronger than all previous imperialisms, but it is also more fragile. It is in an antagonistic position with the peoples of the world, including the American people. The manpower, military power, material resources, and financial resources of American imperialism are far from sufficient compared to its ambition to dominate the globe. It has occupied so many places in the world, its hands are stretched out so far, its ten fingers are spread out so wide, its strength is scattered so thin, and its rear is so far away, its supply lines are so long, which further weakens itself. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the peoples of the world."

American imperialism, when invading other countries, can only use part of its strength, far from its homeland, to fight an unjust war, with low morale and many difficulties. The invaded peoples are not going to Washington and New York to fight American imperialism, nor are they going to Honolulu and Florida to fight American imperialism, but are fighting for independence and freedom on their own soil. Once they are broadly mobilized, they can produce boundless strength. In this way, the advantage is not on the American side but on the side of the invaded peoples. The seemingly weak invaded peoples are actually much stronger than American imperialism.

The struggles of the peoples of various countries against American imperialism are mutually supportive. These struggles have converged into a world torrent against American imperialism. The more a people's war in one place develops victoriously, the more it can tie down and consume more strength of American imperialism. When the American aggressors are in a tight spot in one place, they have to relax in other places. In this way, the peoples in other places have more favorable conditions to launch struggles against American imperialism and its lackeys.

Everything in the world can be divided. This American imperialist giant can also be divided and defeated. The peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions, you strike its head, I strike its feet, we eat it bit by bit, we destroy it part by part. American imperialism is most afraid of the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, rising up to conduct people's wars, because it regards people's war as a fatal threat to itself. The reason is here.

What American imperialism uses to intimidate people is nothing but its nuclear weapons. However, nuclear weapons cannot save its life. Nuclear weapons are not something that can be easily used. The heinous crime of American imperialism dropping two atomic bombs on Japan is still being condemned by the peoples of the world. If it dares to use nuclear weapons again, it will put itself in an extremely isolated position. Moreover, the monopoly of nuclear weapons has long been broken. It has them, others have them too. If it uses nuclear weapons to threaten other countries, it will also put its own country under the threat of nuclear weapons. In this way, it will not only face the strong opposition of the peoples of the world but will inevitably face the strong opposition of its own people. Even if American imperialism dares to use nuclear weapons, it will not be able to conquer the unyielding peoples.

No matter how modern weapons and technological equipment develop, no matter how complex modern warfare is, the final victory or defeat of the war ultimately depends on the continuous fighting of ground forces, depends on close combat on the battlefield, depends on people's awareness, bravery, and spirit of sacrifice. Here, the weaknesses of American imperialism are greatly exposed, while the advantages of revolutionary peoples are greatly manifested. The reactionary army of American imperialism cannot have the bravery and spirit of sacrifice of revolutionary peoples. The spiritual atomic bomb of revolutionary peoples is much stronger and more useful than the material atomic bomb.

The most convincing example today of defeating American imperialism with people's war is in Vietnam. The United States has turned South Vietnam into a testing ground for suppressing people's war. The United States has been conducting this test for many years, and now everyone can see that the American aggressors have found no way to deal with people's war. The Vietnamese people, however, have greatly demonstrated the power of people's war in their struggle against American aggression. The American aggressors are facing imminent doom in the Vietnamese people's war. They are very worried that their failure in Vietnam will cause a chain reaction. They are expanding the war, attempting to salvage the situation. However, the more the war is expanded, the greater the chain reaction it causes; the more the war is escalated, the harder it falls, and the more miserable the failure. The peoples of other places in the world will see more clearly that American imperialism can be defeated. What the Vietnamese people have done, they can also do.

History has proven and will continue to prove: people's war is the most effective weapon against American imperialism and its lackeys. All revolutionary peoples of the world will learn to use people's war to deal with American imperialism and its lackeys, will go from having no weapons to taking up weapons, from not knowing how to fight to learning how to fight, from not being good at conducting people's war to being good at conducting people's war. This American imperialist bull, which roams everywhere, will eventually be burned to ashes in the people's war it itself ignited.

Khrushchev Revisionism is the Traitor of People's War

Just when American imperialism is most afraid of and unable to deal with people's war, Khrushchev revisionism comes out to help American imperialism. They closely cooperate with American imperialism, desperately spreading various anti-people's war arguments, secretly and openly engaging in sabotage of people's war. Khrushchev revisionism opposes people's war fundamentally because they do not believe in the masses, fear American imperialism, fear war, and fear revolution. Like all opportunists, they do not see the strength of the masses in their eyes, do not believe that revolutionary peoples can defeat imperialism. They surrender to the nuclear blackmail of American imperialism, fearing that the oppressed peoples and nations will rise up to conduct people's war, or that the peoples of socialist countries will counterattack American imperialist aggression, which will anger American imperialism, will implicate themselves, and will hinder their realization of the beautiful dream of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world.

From the leadership of the great October Revolution by Lenin to the present, countless revolutionary war experiences have proven the truth: the revolutionary peoples who started with bare hands ultimately defeated the ruling class armed to the teeth. Those with inferior weapons defeated those with superior weapons. Guerrillas ultimately defeated regular armies. Those who had not attended military schools, the "country bumpkins," ultimately defeated those who had graduated from military schools, the "foreign experts." And so on. Things just do not develop according to the words of revisionism but instead give revisionism a slap in the face.

Khrushchev revisionism insists that countries without nuclear weapons, no matter what kind of combat methods they use, cannot defeat enemies with nuclear weapons. This is equivalent to saying that whoever does not have nuclear weapons deserves to be unlucky, deserves to be bullied, deserves to be annihilated, either to surrender in the face of the enemy's nuclear weapons or to rely on the "protection" of other nuclear powers and follow their lead. Isn't this typical survival of the fittest? Isn't this helping imperialism with nuclear blackmail? Isn't this openly not allowing others to revolt?

Khrushchev revisionism insists that nuclear weapons and rocket forces decide everything, conventional forces are insignificant, and militias are just a pile of meat. They use such fallacies to oppose socialist countries mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and preparing to use people's war to deal with imperialist aggression. They bet the fate of the country on the gamble of nuclear weapons, engaging in nuclear gambling and political bargaining with American imperialism. Their military strategic thinking is the theory of nuclear weapons. Their military line is the bourgeois military line of seeing only things, not people, wanting only technology, not politics.

Khrushchev revisionism insists that any spark on Earth will lead to a world nuclear war, destroying humanity. According to their argument, our Earth should have been destroyed countless times by now. However, in the twenty years after the war, national liberation wars have continued without interruption. Which one of them developed into a world war? Isn't it precisely the national liberation wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that have disrupted American imperialism's plans to launch a world war? On the contrary, those who try every means to extinguish the "spark" of people's war are actually fanning the flames of American imperialism's aggression and war.

Khrushchev revisionism insists that as long as their "peaceful coexistence, peaceful transition, peaceful competition" general line is implemented, the oppressed will be liberated and a world without weapons, without armies, and without war will be realized. However, the cruel reality is that imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries are frenziedly strengthening their war machines, slaughtering revolutionary peoples every day, invading and threatening countries that have already gained independence every day. The bloody lessons of some countries, where Khrushchev revisionism has caused countless heads to roll, are not enough? The essence of Khrushchev revisionism's general line is not to allow the oppressed peoples and nations to lay down their weapons, to allow countries that have already gained independence to lay down their weapons, and to be slaughtered by the fully armed American imperialism and its lackeys.

Imperialism and reactionaries are "only allowing the officials to set fires, not allowing the common people to light lamps." Khrushchev revisionism has accepted this philosophy of imperialism. They say to the Chinese people, who are at the forefront of defending world peace, "You are warmongers!" Gentlemen, your insults are precisely our glory. Our "warmongering" is precisely beneficial to stopping imperialism from launching a world war. The "warmongering" of the people is for self-defense, is forced by imperialism and reactionaries, and is also taught by them. We are only using revolutionary "warmongering" to counter the warmongering of counter-revolutionaries. Is it allowed for imperialism and its lackeys to kill people everywhere, but not allowed for the people to defend themselves and support each other? Where is the logic in the world? Khrushchev revisionism calls Kennedy and Johnson, these imperialists, "wise men," and calls us and all those who dare to defend themselves with arms against imperialist aggression "warmongers." This completely exposes Khrushchev revisionism as the accomplice of imperialist robbers.

We understand that war will bring destruction, sacrifice, and suffering to the people. However, if we do not resist the armed invasion of imperialism and are willing to be slaves of a defeated country, then the destruction, sacrifice, and suffering we will face will be even greater. In revolutionary war, the sacrifice of a few can bring safety to the entire nation, the entire country, and even the entire humanity; temporary pain can bring long-term, even permanent, peace and happiness. War can temper the people and promote the progress of history. In this sense, war is a great school.

When talking about the First World War, Lenin said: "War has plunged the most civilized and culturally advanced countries into starvation. However, on the other hand, as a great historical process, war has unprecedentedly accelerated social development." "War awakens the masses, with unprecedented calamities and sufferings, it arouses them. War promotes history, and thus history is now advancing at the speed of a locomotive." According to the words of Khrushchev revisionism, isn't Lenin the greatest "warmonger"?

Completely opposite to the views of Khrushchev revisionism, Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples have never used sentimental views to look at war. For the aggressive wars launched by imperialism, our attitude has always been very clear: first, oppose, second, not fear. Whoever attacks us, we will annihilate them. For the revolutionary wars waged by the oppressed nations and peoples, we not only do not oppose but have always firmly supported and actively aided. It was the same in the past, it is the same now, and in the future, as our strength develops, this support and aid will only become stronger. Whoever thinks that we will lose our revolutionary spirit because of the victory of the revolution, the development of construction, the growth of our business, and the improvement of our lives, and abandon the cause of world revolution, discard Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is daydreaming! Of course, any revolution is out of the demand of the people of one's own country. Only when the people of one's own country awaken, mobilize, organize, and arm themselves, can they, through struggle, overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackeys, and it cannot be replaced or taken over by any foreigner. In this sense, revolution cannot be imported. However, this does not exclude the mutual sympathy and support of the revolutionary peoples of the world in their struggles against imperialism and its lackeys. Our support for the revolutionary peoples of various countries is precisely helpful for them to struggle independently.

The propaganda of Khrushchev revisionism against people's war, defeatist propaganda, and surrenderist propaganda has a demoralizing effect on the revolutionary peoples of the world, a disarming effect on the spirit. They have done what American imperialism itself cannot do, helping American imperialism greatly. They have greatly encouraged American imperialism to engage in war adventures. Khrushchev revisionism has completely betrayed the revolutionary theory of war of Marxism-Leninism and become a traitor to people's war.

All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, to successfully fight against American imperialism, to successfully conduct people's war, must resolutely oppose Khrushchev revisionism.

Now, in the revolutionary peoples of the world, the market for Khrushchev revisionism is getting smaller and smaller. Wherever there is armed invasion and armed suppression by imperialism and its lackeys, there is resistance to invasion and suppression of people's war. People's war will inevitably flourish, this is an objective law, neither subject to the will of American imperialists nor subject to the will of Khrushchev revisionists. The revolutionary peoples of the world can sweep everything away on the road of advancement. Khrushchev has been finished, and the successors of Khrushchev revisionism will not have a good end. The imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, and Khrushchev revisionists who oppose people's war will all be swept clean from the stage of history by the iron broom of revolutionary peoples.

In the twenty years since the victory of the War of Resistance, China has changed greatly, and the world has changed greatly, making it more favorable for the revolutionary peoples of the world and more unfavorable for imperialism and its lackeys.

When Japanese imperialism launched the war of aggression against China, the Chinese people had only a small people's army and a small revolutionary base, while facing an Eastern military tyrant. Even at that time, Comrade Mao Zedong said that the Chinese people's war could be victorious and that Japanese imperialism could be defeated. Today, the revolutionary bases of the world's peoples have expanded unprecedentedly, and the revolutionary movements of the world's peoples have surged unprecedentedly. Imperialism is unprecedentedly weak, and the head of imperialism, American imperialism, has suffered repeated defeats. We can even more confidently say that the people's wars of various countries can be victorious and that American imperialism can be defeated.

The world's peoples have the experience of the October Revolution, the experience of the anti-fascist war, the experience of the Chinese people's War of Resistance and Liberation War, the experience of the Korean people's anti-American war, the experience of the Vietnamese people's liberation war and anti-American war, and the experience of the armed struggles of the peoples of many other countries. As long as one is good at studying these experiences and creatively combining them with the specific practices of one's own country's revolution, then the revolutionary peoples of various countries will be able to perform more magnificent and heroic historical dramas on the stage of people's war in their own countries and ultimately bury all the common enemies of the peoples of various countries, American imperialism and its lackeys.

The anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people is the focal point of the global anti-American struggle today. The Chinese people's determination to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle is unshakable. No matter how much American imperialism expands its war adventures, the Chinese people will support the Vietnamese people with all their strength until they drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam, not leaving a single one.

American imperialists are now shouting about wanting to have another showdown with the Chinese people, to fight another large-scale ground war on the Asian continent. If they insist on taking the old road of Japanese fascism, then fine, let them do as they please. The Chinese people have their own ways to deal with American imperialist aggression. Our way is not a secret, the most important thing is still that: mobilize the people, rely on the people, implement the whole nation in arms, and conduct people's war.

We can once again inform the American imperialists: the vast ocean of hundreds of millions of Chinese people armed with weapons is enough to accommodate your hundreds of thousands of invading troops. If you dare to impose war on us, you will give us the freedom to act. At that time, how the war is fought will not be up to you. Whatever is beneficial to annihilating the enemy, we will do that. Where it is good to annihilate the enemy, we will fight there. Since the Chinese people were able to defeat the Japanese invaders twenty years ago, today, the Chinese people are even more confident in putting the American invaders to death. Your boasting of sea and air superiority cannot intimidate the Chinese people. Your waving of atomic bombs cannot intimidate the Chinese people. If you want to send troops, then come, the more the better. You come as many as you want, and we will give you a receipt for as many as you come. The Chinese people are a great people. We dare to shoulder the burden of resisting American imperialism and, in the final struggle to defeat this most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world, make our contribution.

It must be solemnly pointed out that after the victory of the War of Resistance, Taiwan has already been returned to China. American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan is utterly unreasonable. Taiwan Province is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. American imperialism must get out of Taiwan. The Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan.

On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance, we must also solemnly point out that the Japanese militarists, with the support of American imperialism, if they disregard the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia and insist on reviving old dreams and taking the old road of invading Asia, they will inevitably face even more severe punishment.

American imperialism is preparing for a world war. However, can this save American imperialism's life? After the First World War, a socialist Soviet Union emerged. After the Second World War, a series of socialist countries and many independent nations emerged. If American imperialism insists on launching a Third World War, it can be asserted that the result will be that billions more people will turn to socialism, and the remaining territory of imperialism will not be much, and the entire imperialist system may collapse.

We are optimistic about the future of the world. We firmly believe that the era of war in human life will be ended by the hands of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out: "This monster of war, 'human society will ultimately eliminate it, and in the not too distant future, it will be eliminated.' However, the method of eliminating it is only one, that is, to use war to counter war, to use revolutionary war to counter counter-revolutionary war."

All peoples suffering from American imperialist invasion, oppression, and plunder, unite, raise the banner of people's war for justice, and fight for world peace, national liberation, people's democracy, and the cause of socialism. Victory will belong to the peoples of the world! Long live the victory of people's war!

    人民战争胜利万岁
    纪念中国人民抗日战争胜利二十周年
    林彪
    （一九六五年九月三日）
    伟大的抗日战争的胜利，整整二十年了。
    二十年前，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，经过长期的英勇奋斗，终于打败了企图灭亡中国、吞并亚洲的日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的最后胜利。
    中国人民的抗日战争，是反对德、日、意法西斯的世界战争的一个重要组成部分。中国人民得到了全世界人民和反法西斯力量的支持。中国人民也对世界反法西斯战争的胜利作出了重大的贡献。
    抗日战争，是中国人民在一百年来无数次反抗帝国主义的战争中第一次取得完全胜利的战争。这场战争，不仅在中国人民革命战争的历史上，而且在世界被压迫民族反对帝国主义侵略的战争历史上，都占有极为重要的地位。
    抗日战争，是一个半殖民地半封建的弱国战胜一个帝国主义强国的战争。从日本帝国主义入侵我国东北的时候起，国民党在长时期内采取了不抵抗主义。在抗日战争初期，日本帝国主义利用它的军事优势，长驱直入，占领了半个中国。在日本侵略者大肆进攻和全国人民抗日高潮的面前，国民党被迫参加了抗战，但是，不久以后，他们就采取了消极抗战、积极反共的方针。抗日战争的重担，落到中国共产党领导的八路军、新四军和解放区人民身上。八路军和新四军在抗战开始的时候只有几万人，武器和装备都很差，而且长期处在日本帝国主义和国民党军队的两面夹击之下，但是，他们越战越强，成为打败日本帝国主义的主力军。
    为什么一个弱国能够最后战胜强国呢？为什么看来似乎弱小的军队能够成为抗日战争的主力军呢？
    最根本的原因，在于抗日战争是中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导的一场真正的人民战争，实行了马克思列宁主义的正确的政治路线和军事路线；八路军和新四军是真正的人民军队，实行了毛泽东同志所制定的一整套人民战争的战略战术。
    毛泽东同志关于人民战争的一系列理论和政策，创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。中国人民抗日战争的胜利，是人民战争的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    在抗日战争以前，中国共产党经历了一九二四年到一九二七年的第一次国内革命战争和一九二七年到一九三六年的第二次国内革命战争，总结了战争的胜利和失败的经验教训，确立了毛泽东思想在党内的领导地位。这是中国共产党领导中国人民取得抗日战争胜利的根本保证。
    中国人民抗日战争的胜利，为夺取全国政权准备了条件。一九四六年，当国民党反动派在美帝国主义的支持下发动全国内战的时候，中国共产党和毛泽东同志进一步发展了人民战争的思想，领导中国人民进行了更大规模的人民战争，仅仅用了三年多的时间，就取得了人民解放战争的伟大胜利，结束了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立了中华人民共和国。
    中国人民革命战争的胜利，冲破了帝国主义的东方战线，极大地改变了世界力量的对比，促进了各国人民的革命运动。从此，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动进入一个新的历史时期。
    今天，美帝国主义正在世界范围内重复着当年日本帝国主义在中国和亚洲所做的事情。掌握和运用人民战争这个武器来对付美帝国主义及其走狗，已经成为许多国家人民的迫切需要。美帝国主义及其走狗正在用尽一切办法，企图扑灭人民战争的革命烈火。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也象害怕瘟疫一样地害怕人民战争，诬蔑人民战争。他们互相勾结起来，阻挠和破坏人民战争。在这种情况下，重温中国人民战争取得伟大胜利的历史经验，重温毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论，具有特别重大的现实意义。
    抗日战争时期的主要矛盾和党的路线
    中国共产党和毛泽东同志所以能够领导中国人民取得抗日战争的胜利，首先在于制订和执行了一条马克思列宁主义的路线。
    毛泽东同志依据马克思列宁主义的基本原理，运用阶级分析的方法，分析了日本帝国主义侵入中国以后中国的主要矛盾和非主要矛盾的转化，以及由此而引起的中国阶级关系和国际关系的新变动，分析了中日双方的力量对比，为制定抗日战争的政治路线和军事路线提供了科学的根据。
    很久以来，中国就存在着两种基本矛盾，这就是帝国主义同中华民族的矛盾，封建主义同人民大众的矛盾。抗日战争爆发以前，代表帝国主义、大地主和大资产阶级利益的国民党反动集团，同代表中国人民利益的中国共产党及其领导的工农红军之间，进行了十年的国内战争。一九三一年，日本帝国主义侵占中国的东北，随后，特别是一九三五年以后，又步步深入，加紧扩大对中国的侵略。日本帝国主义的入侵，使日本帝国主义同中华民族之间的矛盾极度地尖锐化，使国内的阶级关系有了新的变动。停止内战，一致抗日，成为全国人民的迫切要求。民族资产阶级和国民党内部各派系的政治态度，发生了不同程度的变化。一九三六年的西安事变①就是最好的说明。
    怎样认识中国政治形势的变化？从这些变化中应当得出怎样的结论？这是关系到中华民族生死存亡的问题。
    在抗日战争爆发以前的一段时间内，在中国共产党内，以王明为代表的“左”倾机会主义者，闭眼不看一九三一年以后由日本侵略所引起的国内政治的重大变化，否认中日民族矛盾上升和各阶层的抗日要求，而强调中国所有反革命派别和中间派、所有帝国主义都是完全一致的。他们坚持关门主义的路线，继续主张打倒一切。
    毛泽东同志坚决反对“左”倾机会主义的错误，深刻地分析了中国革命的新形势。
    毛泽东同志指出：日本帝国主义要变中国为它的殖民地，使中日矛盾上升为主要矛盾。中国内部的各种阶级矛盾，如人民大众同封建主义的矛盾，农民同地主阶级的矛盾，无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾，农民、城市小资产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾等依然存在，但是，这些矛盾在日本发动侵华战争面前，都下降到次要的和服从的地位。全中国各阶级各阶层的人民，除了大地主、大资产阶级中的亲日派等一小撮卖国贼以外，产生了共同的要求，这就是反对日本帝国主义。
    由于中日矛盾上升为主要矛盾，中国同英美等帝国主义的矛盾也下降到次要的和服从的地位。日本帝国主义要把中国变成它一国的殖民地，扩大了它同英美等帝国主义之间的矛盾。这就使中国有可能利用这种矛盾，来孤立和反对日本帝国主义。
    在日本帝国主义的侵略面前，是继续进行国内战争和土地革命呢？还是高举民族解放的旗帜，团结一切可以团结的力量，建立广泛的民族统一战线，集中反对日本侵略者呢？问题就是这样尖锐地摆在我们党的面前。
    中国共产党和毛泽东同志根据对新形势的分析，制定了抗日民族统一战线的路线。我们党高举民族解放的旗帜，提出全国团结、一致抗日的主张，得到了全国人民的热烈拥护。经过我们党和全国爱国军民的共同努力，终于迫使国民党统治集团停止了内战，出现了国共合作、团结抗日的新局面。
    一九三七年夏天，日本帝国主义发动了全面的侵华战争。全国规模的抗日战争爆发了。
    抗日战争能不能胜利？怎样才能取得胜利？这是全中国人民迫切要求回答的问题。
    失败主义者跑出来说：中国打不过日本，非亡国不可。盲目乐观主义者跑出来说：中国很快就能够胜利，无需乎费很大力气。
    毛泽东同志对中华民族同日本帝国主义这个主要矛盾的两个方面进行了具体的分析，指出“亡国论”是错误的，“速胜论”是没有根据的，抗日战争是持久战，最后胜利是中国的。
    毛泽东同志在著名的《论持久战》一书中指出，中日双方，在战争中有以下这些互相矛盾着的特点：日本是一个帝国主义的强国；然而，日本帝国主义是处在垂死没落的时代，它所发动的战争是侵略性的、退步的和野蛮的；它的人力、物力不足，经不起长期战争；在国际方面，它失道寡助。中国是一个半殖民地半封建的弱国；然而，中国是处在历史上进步的时代，它所进行的战争是反侵略的、进步的和正义的；中国拥有能够支持长期战争的人力、物力；在国际方面，它得到广大的同情和支持。这就是中日战争的全部基本要素。
    毛泽东同志还指出，这些要素将在战争的进程中发生作用。日本的长处是暂时的，会由于我们的努力逐渐削弱。日本的短处是基本的，是不能克服的，会在战争中逐渐扩大。中国的短处是暂时的，会逐渐被克服。中国的长处是基本的，会在战争中逐渐发挥出积极的作用。日本的长处和中国的短处，决定了中国不能速胜。中国的长处和日本的短处，决定了日本必败，最后胜利是中国的。
    毛泽东同志根据这样的分析，制定了持久战的战略方针。这就是说，中国的抗战是长期的，必须经过长时间的努力，才能逐步地削弱敌人，壮大自己，使敌人变强为弱，使自己变弱为强，积聚起足以最后打败敌人的力量。毛泽东同志指出，随着敌我力量的消长，抗日战争将会经过战略防御、战略相持和战略反攻这三个阶段。持久战的过程，也就是动员人民、组织人民、武装人民的过程。只有全民动员起来，进行人民战争，才能坚持抗战，打败日本侵略者。
    为了使抗日战争成为真正的人民战争，我们党坚持依靠广大的人民群众，团结一切可以团结的抗日力量，巩固和扩大抗日民族统一战线。我们党的基本路线是：放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国。
    抗日战争是中国新民主主义革命的一个历史阶段。我们党在抗日战争中的路线，不仅是要取得抗日战争的胜利，而且是要为新民主主义革命在全国范围内的胜利奠定基础。只有完成了新民主主义革命，才能进行社会主义革命。毛泽东同志说，民主革命和社会主义革命，“两篇文章，上篇与下篇，只有上篇做好，下篇才能做好。坚决地领导民主革命，是争取社会主义胜利的条件”。②
    具体地分析具体事物，具体地解决具体矛盾，是马克思列宁主义的活的灵魂。毛泽东同志在错综复杂的矛盾中，抓住了主要矛盾，具体地分析了主要矛盾的两个方面，高屋建瓴，势如破竹，顺利地解决了怎样认识和对待各种矛盾的问题。
    毛泽东同志正是在这样科学分析的基础上，正确地制定了抗日战争时期人民战争的政治路线和军事路线，进一步发展了建设农村根据地、农村包围城市、最后夺取城市的思想，并且在政治、军事、经济、文化等各方面制定了一系列实行人民战争的方针政策和战略战术，从而保证了抗日战争的胜利，为新民主主义革命在全国范围内的胜利准备了条件。
    正确执行统一战线的路线和政策
    为了赢得人民战争的胜利，必须建立最广泛的统一战线，并且要有一系列的既能最充分地发动基本群众、又能团结一切可以团结的力量的政策。
    抗日民族统一战线包括了所有抗日的阶级和阶层。这些阶级和阶层，有着抗日的共同利益，这是团结的基础。但是，这些阶级和阶层的抗日坚定性各有不同，而且他们相互之间存在着阶级矛盾，存在着不同的利害冲突。这就使得统一战线内部的阶级斗争不可避免。
    在制定党的抗日民族统一战线的路线的时候，毛泽东同志是这样分析我国社会各阶级的：
    工人、农民、城市小资产阶级是坚决要求抗战到底的，他们是抗日的主力，也是要求团结和进步的基本群众。
    资产阶级有民族资产阶级和买办资产阶级之分。资产阶级里头，人数比较多的是民族资产阶级，他们比较软弱，经常动摇，同工人也有矛盾，但是他们有一定程度的反帝积极性，在抗日战争中是我们的同盟军。买办资产阶级就是官僚资产阶级，他们人数很少，但在中国占据着统治地位。他们分别依附于不同的帝国主义，有亲日派，有亲英美派。亲日的买办资产阶级是投降派，是公开的或隐蔽的汉奸。亲英美的买办资产阶级，在一定的程度上赞成抗日，但是他们抗日是不坚决的，很想同日本妥协，他们本质上是反共、反人民的。
    地主有大中小之分。一部分大地主成了汉奸。另一部分大地主赞成抗日，但非常动摇。许多中小地主有抗日的要求，但是他们同农民存在着矛盾。
    面对着这样错综复杂的阶级关系，我们党在统一战线内部的工作方针是又联合又斗争的方针。这就是说，团结一切抗日的阶级和阶层，那怕是动摇的暂时的同盟者也要争取，采取适当的政策来调整各抗日阶级和阶层之间的相互关系，使之适应抗日的总任务。同时，坚持我们党的独立自主的原则，把自己的工作重点放在放手发动群众和壮大人民力量上面，同一切不利于抗战、团结、进步的行为进行必要的斗争。
    我们党的抗日民族统一战线的方针，既不同于陈独秀的右倾机会主义的一切联合、否认斗争的方针，也不同于王明的“左”倾机会主义的一切斗争、否认联合的方针。我们党总结了右倾和“左”倾机会主义的错误教训，形成了又联合又斗争的方针。
    为了联合包括国民党在内的一切抗日党派和阶层一致抗日，我们党作了一系列的政策上的调整。我们宣布为彻底实现孙中山的革命的三民主义而斗争。我们的陕甘宁革命根据地的政府，改名为中华民国陕甘宁特区政府。我们的军队，由工农红军改为国民革命军第八路军和新编第四军。我们的土地政策，由没收地主的土地，改为减租减息。我们在根据地内，实行了三三制的政权，③吸收那些主张抗日而又不反共的小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、开明绅士的代表和国民党员参加。其他关于经济、税收、劳动工资、锄奸、人民权利、文化教育等方面的政策，也都根据抗日民族统一战线的原则，做了必要的和适当的改变。
    在进行这些政策上的调整的同时，我们坚持了共产党、人民军队和根据地的独立性。我们还坚持要求国民党必须实行全国总动员，改革政治机构，开放民主，改善人民生活，武装民众，实现全面抗战。对于国民党消极抗战，积极反共，压制人民抗日运动，以及妥协投降的阴谋活动，我们进行了坚决的斗争。
    历史的经验告诉我们，当我们党纠正了右的错误以后，容易产生“左”的错误；当我们党纠正了“左”的错误以后，容易产生右的错误。当我们同国民党统治集团决裂的时候，容易产生“左”的错误；当我们同国民党统治集团联合的时候，容易产生右的错误。
    在反对“左”倾机会主义，建立起抗日民族统一战线以后，我们党内的主要危险是右倾机会主义，也就是投降主义。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期作为“左”倾机会主义代表的王明，在抗日战争初期走向另一极端，成为右倾机会主义，即投降主义的代表。王明用彻头彻尾的投降主义路线和一系列极右的政策，来反对毛泽东同志的正确路线和政策。他自愿放弃无产阶级在抗日民族统一战线中的领导权，而把这个领导权自愿送给国民党。他主张“一切经过统一战线”、“一切服从统一战线”，实际上就是一切经过和服从蒋介石和国民党。他反对放手发动群众，反对实行民主改革，反对改善工农生活，破坏统一战线的基础工农联盟。他不要共产党领导下的人民革命力量的根据地，要使人民革命力量变成断了线的风筝。他不要共产党领导下的人民军队，要把人民的武装，也就是人民的一切，都交给蒋介石。他不要党的领导，主张国共两党青年结成联盟，以适应蒋介石溶化共产党的企图。他自己“梳妆打扮，送上门去”，指望能够封上一官半职。王明的这一套完全是修正主义的。如果按照他的这一套修正主义路线和政策办事，中国人民就不可能取得抗日战争的胜利，更不可能有后来的全国胜利。
    王明的修正主义路线，在抗日战争的一段时间内，曾经给中国人民的革命事业带来了损害。但是，毛泽东同志的领导地位已经在我们党中央确立起来。在毛泽东同志的领导下，全党的马克思列宁主义者对王明的错误进行了坚决的斗争，及时地纠正了这种错误。这才使得王明的错误路线没有在更大的范围和更长的时间内危害党的事业。
    对于我们纠正王明的错误，蒋介石这个反面教员帮了忙。蒋介石用大炮和机关枪多次给我们上课。其中最严重的一次，就是一九四一年一月的皖南事变。驻在皖南的新四军，由于个别领导人违背党中央的指示，执行王明的修正主义路线，在蒋介石发动突然袭击的面前遭到惨痛的损失，许多英勇的革命战士遭到国民党反动派的屠杀。血的教训，使得我们的许多同志头脑清醒了，识别正确路线和错误路线的能力提高了。
    毛泽东同志不断地总结了全党贯彻执行抗日民族统一战线的经验，及时地制订了一系列的政策，主要是：
    第一，一切抗日的人民（工、农、兵、学、商）联合起来，组成抗日民族统一战线。
    第二，统一战线下的独立自主政策，既须统一，又须独立。
    第三，在军事战略方面，是战略统一下的独立自主的游击战争，基本上是游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战。
    第四，在同以蒋介石为首的反共顽固派斗争时，是利用矛盾，争取多数，反对少数，各个击破；是有理，有利，有节。
    第五，在日本占领区和国民党统治区的政策，是一方面尽量地发展统一战线的工作，一方面采取隐蔽精干的政策；是在组织方式和斗争方式上采取隐蔽精干、长期埋伏、积蓄力量、以待时机的政策。
    第六，对于国内各阶级相互关系的基本政策，是发展进步势力，争取中间势力，孤立反共顽固势力。
    第七，对于反共顽固派实行革命的两面政策，对其勉强抗日的方面是加以联合的政策，对其坚决反共的方面是进行斗争和加以孤立的政策。
    第八，对地主资产阶级，乃至对大地主大资产阶级，都要加以分析，加以区别。根据这些区别，来建立我们各项不同的政策，以达到团结一切可以团结的力量的目的。
    毛泽东同志制定的抗日民族统一战线的路线和各项政策，经过抗日战争的考验，已经证明是完全正确的。
    历史证明，共产党在凶恶的帝国主义侵略面前，必须高高举起民族旗帜，用统一战线这个武器，团结占全国人口百分之九十以上的人民群众和一切爱国反帝的人们，以便最大限度地调动一切积极因素，最大限度地团结一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立全民族的共同敌人。如果丢掉民族旗帜，采取关门主义路线，使自己孤立起来，那就谈不到领导权，谈不到发展人民革命事业，那就是在客观上帮助敌人，使自己陷于失败。
    历史证明，共产党在统一战线中必须坚持思想上、政治上和组织上的独立性，坚持独立自主的原则，坚持领导权。由于参加统一战线的各阶级之间存在着阶级差别，党必须采取正确的政策，发展进步势力，争取中间势力，反对顽固势力。党的工作重点，要放在发展进步势力，壮大人民革命力量方面。只有这样，才能保持和加强统一战线。“以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”，④这是我们在反对顽固势力的斗争中的主要经验。历史证明，在民族民主革命中，统一战线必须包括两个联盟。第一个联盟是工农联盟。第二个联盟是劳动人民同资产阶级以及其他非劳动人民的联盟。工农联盟是工人阶级同农民和一切城乡劳动人民之间的联盟，这是统一战线的基础。工人阶级在民族民主革命中是不是能够掌握领导权，关键在于能不能领导农民起来斗争，把广大农民团结在自己的周围。工人阶级只有取得对农民的领导权，在工农联盟的基础上，才有可能结成第二个联盟，才有可能结成广泛的统一战线，才有可能胜利地进行人民战争。否则，一切都是空中楼阁，一切都是纸上谈兵，一切都是不可靠的。
    依靠农民，建立农村根据地
    在半殖民地半封建的中国，农民占整个人口的百分之八十以上。他们身受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的三重压迫和剥削，有强烈的抗日和革命的要求。人民战争要取得胜利，必须主要地依靠农民。
    我们党的许多同志，并不是一开始就认识这个问题的。在我们党的历史上，在第一次国内革命战争时期，陈独秀右倾机会主义者的主要错误之一，就是没有认识农民问题的重要性，他们反对发动农民和武装农民。在第二次国内革命战争时期，王明“左”倾机会主义者的主要错误之一，也是没有认识农民问题的重要性，他们不认识在农民中进行长期艰苦的工作和在农村中建立革命根据地的重要性，而幻想迅速夺取大城市，迅速取得革命在全国的胜利。右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义的错误，给中国革命带来了严重的挫折和失败。
    毛泽东同志早在第一次国内革命战争时期就指出，农民问题在中国革命中占有极端重要的地位。反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命实际上就是农民革命。对农民斗争的领导，是中国无产阶级在资产阶级民主革命中的基本任务。
    在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志又强调指出，农民是无产阶级最可靠和最广大的同盟者，是抗日战争的主力。军队的来源主要是农民。进行长期战争所需要的财力物力主要地也是来自农民。抗日战争必须主要地依靠农民，必须最广泛地发动农民参加。
    抗日战争，实质上就是我们党领导的农民革命战争。我们党发动和组织农民群众，使无产阶级同农民结合起来，就形成了战胜任何强大敌人的最雄厚的力量。
    依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，这是中国革命所走过的胜利的道路。
    毛泽东同志根据中国革命的特点，指出了建立农村革命根据地的重要性。他说：“因为强大的帝国主义及其在中国的反动同盟军，总是长期地占据着中国的中心城市，如果革命的队伍不愿意和帝国主义及其走狗妥协，而要坚持地奋斗下去，如果革命的队伍要准备积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，并避免在力量不够的时候和强大的敌人作决定胜负的战斗，那就必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”⑤
    第二次国内革命战争时期的经验证明，按照毛泽东同志的这个战略思想办事，革命力量就得到了很大的发展，建立了一片又一片的红色根据地。相反的，违背了毛泽东同志这个战略思想，实行“左”倾机会主义者的那一套，革命力量就受到了严重的损害，在城市几乎损失了百分之百，在农村损失了百分之九十。
    在抗日战争中，日本帝国主义的军队侵占了中国的许多大城市和交通要道，但是，它的兵力不足，无法占领广大农村。农村仍然是敌人统治的薄弱环节。这就为建立农村根据地提供了更大的可能性。在抗日战争开始不久，当日本军队向中国内地蜂涌前进，而国民党军队节节败退的时候，我们党领导的八路军、新四军，根据毛泽东同志的英明决策，分成许多支队，勇敢地向敌人的后方挺进，在广大农村建立根据地。在八年抗战中，我们先后在华北、华中和华南建立了十九个抗日根据地。除了大城市和交通要道以外，敌后的广大地区都是人民的天下。
    在抗日根据地中，我们实行民主改革，改善人民生活，把广大农民群众发动和组织起来。在各个根据地内，普遍建立了抗日民主政权，人民群众获得了当家作主的民主权利；同时，实行了削弱封建剥削制度、改善人民生活的“合理负担”政策和“减租减息”政策。这样，就大大提高了农民群众的积极性，照顾和团结了各抗日阶层。我们在制定根据地的各项政策时，还考虑到有利于在敌占区开展工作。
    对敌人占领的城市和乡村，我们把合法斗争和非法斗争结合起来，团结那里的基本群众和一切爱国人士，分化和瓦解敌伪政权，准备在条件成熟的时候，里应外合地打击敌人。
    我们党所建立的根据地，成了中国人民抗日救国的重心。依托这些根据地，我们党发展和壮大了人民革命力量，坚持了长期抗战，取得了抗日战争的胜利。
    当然，革命根据地的发展，不会是一帆风顺的。这种革命根据地是对敌人的巨大威胁，敌人是一定要来进攻的。根据地的发展，不能不是一个扩大、缩小、再扩大的曲折的反复的过程。从一九三七年到一九四○年，抗日根据地曾经发展到拥有一亿人口。可是，从一九四一年到一九四二年，日本帝国主义调动它侵华兵力的大部分，疯狂地进攻和残酷地摧毁我们的根据地。同时，国民党也对我们的根据地实行包围、封锁以至军事进攻。到一九四二年，抗日根据地缩小到只有五千万以下的人口。我们党充分依靠人民群众，坚决采取了一系列正确的政策和措施，使得根据地在极端困难的情况下，也能坚持下来。经过这种曲折，根据地的军民锻炼得更加坚强了。从一九四三年起，我们的根据地又逐步地恢复和扩大起来，到了一九四五年已经发展到一亿六千万人口。在整个中国革命过程中，革命根据地的发展更是经历了许多次的起伏，经受住了许多次的考验，才由小块的被分割的根据地逐步发展为大块的联成一片的根据地，波浪式地向前推进。
    建设革命根据地的过程，也是为准备全国胜利而进行的伟大演习的过程。在根据地里，我们办党，办政权，办人民武装，办群众组织，办工农业生产，办文化教育，办一切为一个地区独立生存所必需的事业。我们的根据地，实际上就是国家的雏型。随着根据地建设事业的逐步发展，我们党锻炼了一支强大的人民军队，培养了从事各方面工作的干部，积累了各方面工作的经验，积蓄物质的和精神的力量，这就为全国胜利准备了有利的条件。
    抗日战争中建立起来的革命根据地，成为中国人民进行打败国民党反动派的人民解放战争的出发点。解放战争时期，我们仍然沿着以农村包围城市、最后夺取城市的道路，取得了全国的胜利。
    建设新型的人民军队
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”⑥这是毛泽东同志根据中国人民在长期革命斗争中用鲜血换来的经验而得出的结论。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    中国革命的特点是武装的革命反对武装的反革命，主要的斗争形式是战争，主要的组织形式是在中国共产党绝对领导下的军队。我们党领导的其他一切组织和斗争，都是直接地或间接地配合战争的。
    在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党的许多优秀同志积极地参加了革命武装斗争。但是，那时我们党还处在幼年时期，对于中国革命的这个特点是没有认识清楚的。经过第一次国内革命战争，在国民党背叛革命，杀死了大批共产党人，摧残了所有革命群众组织之后，我们党才比较清楚地认识到组织革命武装和研究革命战争的战略战术的极端重要性，并且创建了工农红军，这是中国共产党领导下的第一支人民军队。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志创建的工农红军曾经有了很大的发展，达到了三十万人。但是，后来由于“左”倾机会主义的领导，实行错误的政治路线和军事路线，使红军损失了十分之九。
    在抗日战争开始的时候，中国共产党领导的人民军队，只有四万多人。国民党反动派千方百计地企图限制、削弱和消灭这支人民军队。在这种情况下，毛泽东同志指出，为了坚持抗战，打败日本侵略者，必须大大扩大和巩固八路军、新四军和一切我党所领导的游击队。全党都要注重战争，学习军事。每个党员都要时刻准备武装上前线。
    毛泽东同志还尖锐地指出，共产党员不争个人的兵权，但要争党的兵权，要争人民的兵权。
    在党的壮大革命武装力量的正确方针指导下，我们党领导的八路军、新四军和其他抗日游击队，从战争一开始，就迅速奔赴抗日最前线。我们把人民武装的火种撒到广大的敌后地区，到处燃起了游击战争的烽火。我们的人民军队，在战斗中不断地发展壮大起来，到抗日战争结束的时候，已经成了百万大军，并且还有二百多万民兵。正是因为这样，我们在抗日战争中，抗击侵华日军的百分之六十四和伪军的百分之九十五，成了中国抗日战争的主力军。我们在抗击日本侵略军的同时，还打退了国民党反动派在一九三九年、一九四一年和一九四三年发动的三次反共高潮，粉碎他们挑起的无数次“磨擦”。
    八路军、新四军为什么能够在抗日战争中由小到大、从弱变强，取得伟大的胜利呢？
    最根本的原因，就是八路军、新四军是按照毛泽东同志的建军思想建立起来的。这是一支全心全意为人民服务的新型的人民军队。
    按照毛泽东同志的人民军队的建军思想，我们的军队是在中国共产党的绝对领导之下的军队。它无比忠诚地执行党的马克思列宁主义的路线和政策。它有高度自觉的纪律，有压倒一切敌人、不怕任何困难的英雄气概。在军队内部，干部和战士之间、上级和下级之间、各工作部门之间、各兄弟部队之间，完全团结一致。在军队外部，军队和人民之间、军队和地方政府之间，也完全团结一致。
    我们的军队在抗日战争中坚决执行了毛泽东同志规定的打仗、做群众工作和进行生产的三大任务，既是战斗队，又是工作队，也是生产队。他们到处宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，帮助群众建立革命政权。他们严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，开展拥政爱民运动，到处给群众办好事。我军还利用一切可能，自己动手进行生产，借以克服经济困难，改善军队生活，减轻人民负担。我军就这样以自己的模范行动赢得了人民群众的衷心拥护，被广大人民群众亲热地称作“我们的子弟兵”。
    我们的军队不仅有自己的主力军，还有自己的地方军，并且大力建立和发展民兵组织，实行主力军、地方军和民兵三结合的武装力量体制。
    我们的军队还有正确的争取敌军官兵和宽待俘虏的政策。在抗日战争中，我们不但争取了大批的伪军投诚起义，而且还把不少深受法西斯思想毒害的日军俘虏教育过来。他们在提高觉悟以后，组织了日本人解放联盟、在华日本人反战同盟、觉醒联盟等组织，配合我们进行瓦解日军的工作，同我们一起反对日本军国主义。
    毛泽东同志的建军思想的基本精神，就是人民军队的建设要突出政治，要首先和着重地从政治上建军。政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是我军的生命线。人民军队固然也要重视不断改进武器装备和提高军事技术，但是，人民军队打仗不是单纯地凭武器、技术，而更重要的是凭政治，凭指战员的无产阶级革命觉悟和勇敢精神，凭人民群众的拥护和支持。
    由于贯彻执行了毛泽东同志的建军路线，这支军队就能够始终把无产阶级的政治觉悟提得高高的，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把士气鼓得足足的，把团结搞得好好的，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，从而产生了巨大的精神力量。打起仗来不怕苦，不怕死，要冲就冲得上，要守就守得住。一个人顶几个人、几十个人、几百个人用，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    所有这些，就使得中国共产党领导的人民军队，根本区别于资产阶级的军队，区别于一切为剥削阶级服务的、为少数人所驱使和利用的旧军队。中国人民战争的实践经验证明，按照毛泽东同志的建军思想建立起来的人民军队，是无比坚强的，是战无不胜的。
    实行人民战争的战略战术
    恩格斯说过：“无产阶级的解放在军事上也将有它自己的表现，并将创造出自己特殊的、新的作战方法。”⑦中国共产党领导的中国人民革命战争，实现了恩格斯的这个伟大预言。我们在长期的武装斗争中，创造了一套能够以我之长攻敌之短的人民战争的战略战术。
    在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志根据敌我各方面情况的分析，确定我们党领导的八路军、新四军的战略方针是：“基本的是游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战。”⑧毛泽东同志把游击战争提高到战略地位上来，这是因为：在敌我力量悬殊的条件下，革命的武装力量要战胜强大的敌人，不应当同敌人硬拚，否则必将使自己遭受严重的损失，使革命遭受严重的挫折。只有实行游击战争，才能充分动员和高度发挥全民的力量，去同敌人进行斗争，才能在战争中壮大发展自己，消耗和削弱敌人，逐步改变敌我力量的对比，从游击战转变到运动战，最后完全战胜敌人。
    毛泽东同志早在第二次国内革命战争初期提出的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的十六字诀，是游击战的基本战术。在抗日战争中，游击战术有了进一步的发展。敌后根据地的军民，不分男女老幼，人自为战，村自为战，创造了麻雀战、⑨地雷战、地道战、破袭战和水上游击战等各种各样的巧妙打法。
    到了抗日战争末期和第三次国内革命战争时期，根据敌我力量对比的变化，我们的战略方针从以游击战为主转变为以运动战为主。到了第三次国内革命战争中期特别是后期，我们的作战已经发展到大规模的运动战，并且还包括对大城市的攻坚战了。
    歼灭战，是我们作战的基本指导思想。不论以运动战为主，还是以游击战为主，都应当贯彻这个指导思想。在游击战争中，固然要执行许多破坏和袭扰等任务，但是仍然需要积极提倡并且努力实行在一切有利条件下的歼灭性作战。在运动战中，要求每战必须集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人。毛泽东同志说：“击溃战，对于雄厚之敌不是基本上决定胜负的东西。歼灭战，则对任何敌人都立即起了重大的影响。对于人，伤其十指不如断其一指；对于敌，击溃其十个师不如歼灭其一个师。”⑩只有歼灭战，才能最有效地打击敌人，使敌人被歼一旅少一旅，被歼一团少一团，使敌军士气沮丧，内部瓦解。实行歼灭战，我军每战有所俘获，士气越打越高，部队越打越大，武器越打越好，战斗力越打越强。
    毛泽东同志在他提出的著名的十大军事原则中指出：“每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。在特殊情况下，则采用给敌以歼灭性打击的方法，即集中全力打敌正面及其一翼或两翼，求达歼灭其一部、击溃其另一部的目的，以便我军能够迅速转移兵力歼击他部敌军。力求避免打那种得不偿失的、或得失相当的消耗战。这样，在全体上，我们是劣势（就数量来说），但在每一个局部上，在每一个具体战役上，我们是绝对的优势，这就保证了战役的胜利。随着时间的推移，我们就将在全体上转变为优势，直到歼灭一切敌人。”?同时还指出，先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌，力求在运动中歼灭敌人。不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗。战斗中要发扬我军特长和优良的战斗作风。这些都是打歼灭战的主要原则。
    为了歼灭敌人，必须采取诱敌深入的方针，主动地有计划地放弃一些城市和地方，把敌人放进来打。只有把敌人放进来，人民才能用各种各样的行动参加作战，才能最大限度地发挥人民战争的威力。只有把敌人放进来，才能逼着敌人分散兵力，逼着敌人背起包袱，逼着敌人犯错误，也就是让敌人兴高采烈，让敌人的十个指头都伸开，让敌人的两只脚都陷在泥坑里。这样，我们就可以集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人，一口一口地把敌人吃掉。只有歼灭了敌人的有生力量，才能最后保住或夺取城市和地方。那种害怕丢掉地方，害怕打烂坛坛罐罐，而分兵把口、处处抵御的办法，既不能消灭敌人，也不能守住城市和地方，这种办法是我们坚决反对的。
    毛泽东同志把人民战争的战略战术，用四句话加以高度的概括，叫做：你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。
    这就是说，你依靠现代化的武器，我依靠有高度革命觉悟的人民群众；你发挥你的优势，我发挥我的优势；你有你的一套打法，我有我的一套打法。你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着。我打你时，就要打上你，打准你，吃掉你。我能吃掉你时就吃掉你，吃不掉你时也不让你吃掉我。打得赢不打是机会主义，打不赢硬打是冒险主义。我们的一切战略战役方针都是建立在打的这个基本点上。我们承认必须的走，是在首先承认必须的打的条件之下的。一切的走都是为着打，为着最后彻底消灭敌人。这种战略战术，只有依靠广大的人民群众才能实行。而实行这样的战略战术，就能充分发挥人民战争的优越性。不管敌人在技术装备上有什么优势，不管敌人采取什么办法来对付我们，它只能处于被动挨打的地位，主动权就始终在我们手里。
    由于实行了人民战争的战略战术，我们终于从小到大，从弱变强，战胜了国内外的强大敌人。在八年抗日战争中，中国共产党领导的人民军队，对敌作战十二万五千多次，消灭敌伪军一百七十多万人。在三年解放战争中，我们消灭了八百万国民党反动军队，赢得了伟大人民革命的胜利。
    坚持自力更生的方针
    中国人民的抗日战争，是世界反法西斯战争的重要组成部分。整个反法西斯战争的胜利，是世界各国人民共同战斗的结果。在打败日本帝国主义方面，以斯大林为首的苏联共产党领导的苏联军队最后参战起了重要的作用。朝鲜人民、越南人民、蒙古人民、老挝人民、柬埔寨人民、印度尼西亚人民、缅甸人民、印度人民、巴基斯坦人民、马来亚人民、菲律宾人民、泰国人民和其他一些亚洲国家人民都作出了重大的贡献。美洲、大洋洲、欧洲和非洲人民也作出了贡献。
    日本共产党人和日本革命人民在极端困难的情况下，也英勇顽强地坚持斗争，对打败日本法西斯贡献了自己的力量。
    各国人民相互支援，相互鼓舞，赢得了共同的胜利。而每个国家的解放，首先还是靠本国人民的努力。
    中国人民抗日战争的胜利，以及随后人民解放战争的胜利，得到了各国人民的支持，但主要是靠中国人民自己的努力。有些人竟然把中国抗日战争的胜利，说成完全是由于外国的援助。这种荒谬的说法，同日本军国主义者的腔调一模一样。
    人民群众自己解放自己，这是马克思列宁主义的一条基本原理。一个国家的革命，一个国家的人民战争，是本国人民群众自己的事情，应该也只能主要依靠本国人民群众自己的力量。
    在抗日战争中，我们党主张，中国应以自力更生为主，同时尽可能争取外援。我们坚决反对国民党统治集团一切依赖外援的方针。照国民党蒋介石看来，中国什么都不行，工业不行，农业不行，武器装备也不行，要打败日本，就非依靠外国、特别是非依靠美英帝国主义不可。这是十足的奴才思想。我们的方针和国民党完全相反。我们党认为，美英帝国主义同日本帝国主义的矛盾是可以利用的，但决不能依靠它们。事实上，美英帝国主义曾经一再进行“远东慕尼黑”的阴谋活动，企图牺牲中国，同日本帝国主义妥协，并且在一个相当长的时期内还向日本侵略者提供战争物资。美帝国主义在抗战期间给中国的援助，也包含阴险用心，目的是要把中国变成它的殖民地。
    毛泽东同志说，“中国抗战主要地依靠自力更生。”?“我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”?
    对于我们党领导下的人民军队和解放区说来，自力更生格外重要。
    抗日战争初期，国民党政府还给八路军和新四军发一点饷，后来一分钱也不给了。日本帝国主义的疯狂进攻和残酷扫荡，国民党的军事包围和经济封锁，自然灾害的侵袭，使解放区遭到严重的困难。特别是一九四一年和一九四二年，我们曾经几乎没有衣穿，没有饭吃。
    怎么办呢？毛泽东同志说，从古以来的人类究竟是怎样生活的呢？还不是自己动手活下去的吗？为什么我们这些人类子孙连这点聪明都没有呢？为什么我们不能自己动手呢？
    解放区的军民，根据党中央和毛泽东同志提出的“自己动手，丰衣足食”，“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，开展了以农业为主的大规模的生产运动。
    困难，并不是不可征服的怪物，大家动手征服它，它就低头了。国民党反动派以为不给我们发饷，实行经济封锁，就可以困死我们，其实倒是帮了我们的忙，促使我们自力更生，克服困难。我们一方面开展大生产运动，同时，厉行精兵简政，节约人力物力，这就不仅克服了严重的物质困难，胜利地渡过了难关，而且减轻了人民的负担，改善了人民的生活，为抗日战争的胜利奠定了物质基础。
    在解决武器装备方面，我们自己也制造一些武器，但是主要依靠夺取敌人的武器来装备自己。蒋介石、日本帝国主义者、美帝国主义者，一个个都当过我们的“运输大队长”。帝国主义的兵工厂，总是为被压迫人民和被压迫民族提供武器的。
    不论在八年多的抗日战争中，还是三年多的人民解放战争中，我们党领导的人民军队，一直是在没有外来物质援助的情况下，独立地进行大规模的人民战争，并且取得了伟大胜利的。
    毛泽东同志指出，我们的根本方针是要放在自己的力量的基点上。只有依靠自力更生，才能在任何情况下都立于不败之地。
    各国人民在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，总是相互支援的。已经胜利了的国家，有义务支持和援助还没有胜利的人民。但是，无论如何，外援只能起辅助的作用。
    要革命，要进行人民战争，并且要取得胜利，就必须坚持自力更生的方针，依靠本国人民群众的力量，准备在任何外来的物质援助都被切断的情况下独立地进行斗争。如果自己不努力，不独立自主地思考和解决本国的革命问题，不依靠本国人民群众的力量，而一味依赖外国援助，即使是依赖坚持革命的社会主义国家的援助，也是不能取得胜利的，即使胜利了也是不能巩固的。
    毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论的国际意义
    中国革命是伟大的十月革命的继续。十月革命的道路，是世界人民革命的共同道路。中国革命同十月革命在以下的基本点上是共同的：第一，都是以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级领导的。第二，都是以工农联盟为基础的。第三，都是经过暴力革命的道路夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政的。第四，都在革命胜利以后建立了社会主义制度。第五，都是无产阶级世界革命的一个组成部分。
    当然，中国革命有自己的特点。十月革命发生在帝国主义的俄国，中国革命发生在一个半殖民地半封建的国家。十月革命是无产阶级社会主义革命，中国革命是经过新民主主义革命的彻底胜利转变为社会主义革命。十月革命是经过城市武装起义，然后把革命推向农村的；中国革命是以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，取得全国胜利的。
    毛泽东同志的伟大功绩在于，他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，并且根据中国人民长期革命斗争的经验，加以高度的概括和总结，丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论，经过中国革命的长期实践的检验，证明是符合人民战争的客观规律的，是无往而不胜的。它不仅适用于中国，而且是对世界各被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争的伟大贡献。
    中国共产党领导的人民战争，包括抗日战争和国内革命战争，历时二十二年之久，这是当今世界上无产阶级领导的时间最长、斗争最复杂、经验最丰富的人民战争。
    马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命的学说，归根到底，就是用革命暴力夺取政权的学说，用人民战争反对反人民战争的学说。马克思说得好：“暴力是一切旧社会在孕育新社会时的产婆。”?
    毛泽东同志正是根据中国人民战争的经验，用最通俗最鲜明的语言，概括地提出“枪杆子里面出政权”?的著名论断。
    毛泽东同志明确地指出：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”?
    战争是帝国主义和剥削制度的产物。列宁说过，“战争无论何时何地总是由剥削者、统治者和压迫者阶级挑起的。”?只要还存在着帝国主义，存在着剥削制度，帝国主义和反动派总是要依靠武装力量来维持他们的反动统治，总是要把战争强加在被压迫民族和被压迫人民身上。这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。
    在今天的世界上，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗，毫无例外地都在加强它们的国家机器，特别是军队。美帝国主义更是到处进行武装侵略，到处进行武装镇压。
    在帝国主义及其走狗的侵略战争和武装镇压面前，被压迫民族和被压迫人民怎么办？是屈膝投降，永做奴隶呢？还是奋起反抗，争取解放呢？
    毛泽东同志生动地回答了这个问题。他说，中国人民经过长期的调查研究，发现帝国主义及其走狗，“手里都拿着刀，要杀人。人民懂得了，就照样办理”，?以其人之道还治其人之身。
    归根到底，在帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略和武装镇压面前，敢不敢进行针锋相对的斗争，敢不敢进行人民战争，这是敢不敢革命的问题。这个问题，是测定真革命还是假革命、真马克思列宁主义还是假马克思列宁主义最灵验的试金石。
    针对着有些人存在着害怕帝国主义和反动派的怯懦思想，毛泽东同志提出了关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论断。他说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”?
    中国人民战争和其他国家的人民战争的历史有力地证明了：人民革命力量从弱到强，从小到大，是阶级斗争发展的普遍规律，是人民战争发展的普遍规律。人民战争的发展过程，尽管会不可避免地遭受许多困难、曲折和失败，但是，人民战争一定胜利的总趋势，是任何力量也改变不了的。
    毛泽东同志指出，必须在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。
    在战略上藐视敌人，这是对一个革命者的最起码的要求。如果没有藐视敌人、敢于胜利的英雄气概，那就根本谈不上革命，谈不上进行人民战争，更谈不上胜利。
    在战术上重视敌人，对于革命者也是很重要的。如果不在战术上重视敌人，在每个国家的革命的具体实践中，在每一个具体斗争问题上，不研究具体情况，不采取谨慎态度，不讲究斗争艺术，不采取适当的斗争形式，人民战争也是不能取得胜利的。
    辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义告诉我们：最重要的，不是现时似乎坚固、但已经开始衰亡的东西，而是正在产生、正在发展的东西，那怕它现时似乎还不坚固，因为只有正在产生、正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。
    为什么似乎弱小的新生力量总是能够战胜貌似强大的腐朽力量呢？因为真理在他们一边，人民群众在他们一边。而反动阶级总是脱离人民群众，同人民群众对立的。
    中国革命的胜利，证明了这一点。一切革命的历史，整个阶级斗争的历史，整个人类的历史，也都证明了这一点。
    帝国主义者极端害怕毛泽东同志关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的理论，修正主义者极端仇恨这个理论。他们都反对和攻击这个理论。一些庸人们也跟着嘲笑这个理论。但是，这些都丝毫不能贬低这个理论的价值。真理的光辉是任何人无法掩盖的。
    毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论，不但解决了敢于进行人民战争的问题，而且解决了如何进行人民战争的问题。
    毛泽东同志是善于按照战争规律指导战争的伟大的政治家和军事家。毛泽东同志制定的人民战争的路线和政策，战略和战术，引导中国人民，在极端复杂、极端困难的情况下，绕过前进航程上的一切暗礁，把人民战争的大船驶达胜利的彼岸。
    必须着重指出，毛泽东同志关于建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市的理论，对于今天世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争，特别是对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争，更是突出地具有普遍的现实意义。
    现在，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的许多国家和人民，正遭受以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的严重侵略和奴役。不少国家的政治、经济的基本状况，同旧中国有许多共同点。那里的农民问题，同中国一样具有极端重要性。农民是反对帝国主义及其走狗的民族民主革命的主力。帝国主义在侵略这些国家的时候，总是首先侵占大城市和交通要道，但是，广大农村却是它所无法完全控制的。农村，只有农村，才是革命者纵横驰骋的广阔天地。农村，只有农村，才是革命者向最后胜利进军的革命基地。正是因为这样，毛泽东同志关于建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市的理论，在这些地区的人民中产生了越来越大的吸引力。
    从全世界范围看问题，如果说北美、西欧是“世界的城市”，那么，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲就是“世界的农村”。第二次世界大战以后，北美、西欧资本主义国家的无产阶级革命运动由于种种原因被暂时拖延下去，而亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民革命运动却蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。今天的世界革命，从某种意义上说，也是一种农村包围城市的形势。整个世界革命事业，终究要以占世界人口绝大多数的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民革命斗争为转移。社会主义国家理应把支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民革命斗争当成自己的国际主义责任。
    十月革命开辟了被压迫民族革命的新时代。十月革命的胜利，在西方无产阶级社会主义革命同东方殖民地半殖民地国家的民族民主革命之间架起了一座桥梁。中国革命解决了如何在殖民地半殖民地国家把民族民主革命同社会主义革命联系起来的问题。
    毛泽东同志指出，在十月革命以后的时代，任何殖民地半殖民地国家，如果发生了反对帝国主义的革命，它就不再是旧的资产阶级和资本主义的世界革命的一部分，而是新的世界革命的一部分，即无产阶级社会主义的世界革命的一部分了。
    毛泽东同志提出了完整的新民主主义革命论。他指出，新民主主义革命，不是任何别的革命，它只能是和必须是无产阶级领导的，人民大众的，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命。
    这就是说，这个革命不能由任何别的阶级和任何别的政党充当领导者，只能和必须由无产阶级和以马克思列宁主义武装起来的真正革命政党充当领导者。
    这就是说，参加这个革命的，不仅包括了工人、农民、城市小资产阶级，而且包括了民族资产阶级，以及其他反帝爱国民主人士。
    这就是说，这个革命所要反对的敌人，是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。
    新民主主义革命的前途，是社会主义而不是资本主义。
    毛泽东同志关于新民主主义革命的理论，既是马克思列宁主义的革命阶段论，又是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论。
    毛泽东同志正确地把民族民主革命同社会主义革命两个阶段区别开来，同时又正确地把二者紧密联系起来。民族民主革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民族民主革命的发展趋势。这两个革命阶段之间，绝不是横亘着一条万里长城。但是，只有在完成民族民主革命以后，才谈得上社会主义革命。民族民主革命完成得越彻底，就越能为社会主义革命创造前提。
    中国革命的经验表明：民族民主革命的任务，需要经过长期的反复的斗争才能完成。在这个革命阶段里，帝国主义及其走狗是最主要的敌人。在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，必须最广泛地团结一切反帝爱国力量，包括民族资产阶级和一切爱国人士。所有参加反帝斗争的资产阶级和其他剥削阶级中的爱国人士，都在历史上起了进步的作用，为帝国主义所不容，而为无产阶级所欢迎。
    把民族民主革命同社会主义革命这两个阶段混淆起来，是十分有害的。毛泽东同志批判了所谓“毕其功于一役”的错误观点，指出这种空想只能削弱当时最迫切的反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。抗日战争时期的国民党反动派和他们雇佣的托洛茨基派，更是故意混淆中国革命的两个阶段，宣扬所谓“一次革命论”，要实行所谓没有共产党的“社会主义”。他们企图用这种谬论来吞掉共产党，根本消灭任何革命，阻挠民族民主革命的前进，并且以此作为不反对帝国主义和投降帝国主义的口实。这种反动论调，早就被中国革命的历史埋葬了。
    现在，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者大肆宣扬所谓没有无产阶级、没有以无产阶级先进思想武装起来的真正革命政党就能实行社会主义的论调，他们把马克思列宁主义的基本原理抛到九霄云外去了。他们散布这种论调的目的，无非是要转移被压迫民族反对帝国主义的斗争目标，破坏民族民主革命，为帝国主义效劳。
    中国革命，提供了在无产阶级领导下彻底进行民族民主革命的成功的经验，提供了在无产阶级领导下及时地把民族民主革命转变为社会主义革命的成功的经验。
    毛泽东思想是中国革命胜利的指针。毛泽东思想把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，在马克思列宁主义的武库中增添了新的武器。
    我们的时代是一个世界资本主义和帝国主义走向灭亡、社会主义和共产主义走向胜利的时代。毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论，不但是中国革命的产物，而且带有时代的特征。第二次世界大战以后各国人民革命斗争的新经验不断证明，毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的共同财富。这就是毛泽东思想的伟大的国际意义。
    用人民战争战胜美帝国主义及其走狗
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义代替了德、日、意法西斯的地位，企图把全世界都置于它的奴役和控制之下，建立一个美利坚大帝国。它积极扶植日本军国主义和西德军国主义，作为它发动世界战争的主要帮手。它恶狼一般地欺负和奴役各国人民，掠夺各国人民的财富，侵犯别国的主权，干涉别国的内政。它是人类有史以来最狂妄的侵略者，是世界人民共同的最凶恶的敌人。全世界一切要革命、要独立、要和平的人民和国家，都不能不把斗争的主要锋芒指向美帝国主义。
    正象当年日本帝国主义灭亡中国的政策，使得中国人民有可能结成最广泛的统一战线来反对日本帝国主义一样，现在，美帝国主义企图独霸世界的政策，同样使得全世界人民有可能团结一切可以团结的力量，结成最广泛的统一战线，来集中反对美帝国主义。
    现在，以全世界人民为一方，以美帝国主义及其走狗为另一方，所进行的激烈搏斗的主要战场，是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大地区。在世界范围内，这些地区，既是受帝国主义压迫最深重的地区，也是帝国主义统治最薄弱的地区。战后在这些地区出现的越来越高涨的革命风暴，成为当前直接打击美帝国主义的最重要的力量。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国革命人民同以美国为首的帝国主义之间的矛盾，成为当前世界的主要矛盾。这个主要矛盾的发展，推动着全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
    第二次世界大战以后，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区，人民战争越来越显示出它的威力。中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民、老挝人民、古巴人民、印度尼西亚人民、阿尔及利亚人民和其他一些国家的人民，都进行了反对帝国主义及其走狗的人民战争，并且取得了伟大的胜利。这些人民战争，虽然领导的阶级各不相同，发动群众的广度和深度各不相同，取得胜利的程度各不相同，但是，这些人民战争的胜利，大大削弱和牵制了帝国主义的力量，打击了美帝国主义发动世界战争的计划，成为保卫世界和平的强大因素。
    今天，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国革命人民进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的人民战争的条件，比起过去更加有利得多了。
    经过第二次世界大战，经过战后的革命高涨年代，各国人民的觉悟程度和组织程度有了很大的提高，各国人民相互支援的力量已经大大增强。整个资本帝国主义体系已经大大衰弱，处在越来越加剧的震荡和瓦解过程中。如果说，第一次世界大战以后，帝国主义已经无法消灭新生的社会主义苏联，但还能在它们统治的世界里把一些国家的人民革命运动镇压下去，实现一个短暂的相对稳定时期，那么，第二次世界大战以后，帝国主义不仅无法阻止一系列国家走上社会主义的道路，而且在它们统治的世界里再也无法阻挡人民革命运动的汹涌潮流了。
    美帝国主义比历史上所有的帝国主义都更加强大，但是也更加脆弱。它同全世界人民包括美国人民处于敌对的地位。美帝国主义的人力、军力、物力和财力，同它独霸全球的野心比较起来，都是远远不足的。它在世界上霸占的地方那么多，手伸得那么长，十个指头摊得那么开，力量分得那么散，后方离得那么远，运输线拉得那么长，这就更加削弱了它自己。正如毛泽东同志所说：“它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”?
    美帝国主义在侵略别的国家的时候，只能用它的一部分力量，远离本土去打一场非正义的战争，士气低落，困难重重。被侵略的人民，不是到华盛顿和纽约去同美帝国主义较量，也不是到檀香山和弗罗里达去同美帝国主义较量，而是在自己的国土上为独立、自由而战。他们一经广泛动员起来，就能产生无穷无尽的力量。这样，优势就不在美国方面，而是在被侵略的人民方面。看起来弱小的被侵略的人民，实际上比美帝国主义强大得多。
    各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是相互支持的。这些斗争，汇成了一股反对美帝国主义的世界洪流。一个地方的人民战争越是胜利地发展，就越是可以牵制和消耗美帝国主义更多的力量。美国侵略者在一个地方吃紧，对其他地方就不能不放松。这样，其他地方的人民就有更加有利的条件来开展反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
    世界上的一切事物都是可以分割的。美帝国主义这个庞然大物，也是可以分割的，是可以分割开来打败它的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他地区的人民，你打它的头，我打它的脚，一口一口地吃掉它，一部分一部分地消灭它。美帝国主义所以最害怕世界各国人民特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民起来进行人民战争，所以把人民战争看作是对它的致命威胁，道理就在这里。
    美帝国主义借以吓人的，无非是它的核武器。但是，核武器救不了它的命。核武器并不是可以轻易使用的东西。美帝国主义在日本投下两颗原子弹的滔天罪行，一直受着全世界人民的谴责。它要是再使用核武器，就将使得它自己陷于极端孤立的地位。而且，核武器的垄断地位早已被打破。它有，别人也有。它要用核武器来威胁别的国家，也就把它本国置于核武器的威胁之下。这样，它就不仅要遭到世界各国人民的强烈反对，而且必然遭到它本国人民的强烈反对。即使美帝国主义悍然使用核武器，也不可能征服不屈的人民。
    不管现代武器和技术装备怎么发展，不管现代战争的打法怎么复杂，战争的最后胜负，归根到底，还是要决定于地面部队的连续战斗，决定于战场上的近距离搏斗，决定于人的觉悟、勇敢和牺牲精神。在这里，美帝国主义的弱点就极大地暴露出来，而革命人民的优势就极大地发挥出来。美帝国主义的反动军队是不可能有革命人民那样的勇敢和牺牲精神的。革命人民的精神的原子弹，要比物质的原子弹强大得多，有用得多。
    被侵略的人民用人民战争可以打败美帝国主义，当前最有说服力的例子是在越南。美国把越南南方作为镇压人民战争的试验场。美国进行这场试验已经有好多年了，现在谁都可以看到，美国侵略者找不到任何办法来对付人民战争。越南人民却在反对美国侵略者的斗争中，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力。美国侵略者在越南人民战争中正面临着灭顶之灾。它十分担心，它在越南的失败要引起连锁反应。它正在扩大战争，企图挽救败局。但是，战争越是扩大，它所引起的连锁反应也就越大；战争越是升级，它摔得也就越重，失败得也就越惨。世界上其他地方的人民将更加清楚地看到，美帝国主义是可以打败的。越南人民做到的事情，他们也是能够做到的。
    历史已经证明并将继续证明：人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。全世界革命人民，都将学会用人民战争来对付美帝国主义及其走狗，都将从没有武器到拿起武器，从不会打仗到学会打仗，从不善于进行人民战争到善于进行人民战争。美帝国主义这只到处乱闯的野牛，终将在它自己点燃起来的人民战争的烈火中被烧成灰烬。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是人民战争的叛徒
    正当美帝国主义最害怕、最无法对付人民战争的时候，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者出来给美帝国主义帮忙。他们密切配合美帝国主义，拚命散布各种反对人民战争的论调，到处明里暗里进行破坏人民战争的阴谋勾当。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者反对人民战争，根本上是因为他们不相信人民群众，害怕美帝国主义，害怕战争，害怕革命。他们和所有机会主义者一样，眼睛里根本看不到人民群众的力量，不相信革命人民是能够战胜帝国主义的。他们屈服于美帝国主义的核讹诈，担心被压迫人民和被压迫民族起来进行人民战争，或者社会主义国家人民反击美帝国主义侵略，就会触怒美帝国主义，就会连累到他们自己，就会妨碍他们实现苏美合作主宰世界的美梦。
    从列宁领导伟大的十月革命起到现在，无数的革命战争经验，都证明了这样的真理：开始是赤手空拳的革命人民，最后战胜了武装到牙齿的统治阶级。武器差的战胜了武器好的。只有原始的大刀、长矛、步枪、手榴弹的人民军队，最后战胜了拥有现代化的飞机、坦克、大炮、原子弹的帝国主义军队。游击队最后战胜了正规军。没有进过军事学校的“土包子”，最后战胜了军官学校毕业的“洋包子”。如此等等。事情偏偏不按照修正主义者的说法发展，偏偏要打修正主义者的耳光。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者硬说，没有核武器的国家不管采用什么样的作战方法，都不能战胜拥有核武器的敌人。这就等于说，谁没有核武器，谁就活该倒霉，活该被欺侮，活该被消灭，要么在敌人的核武器面前投降，要么依靠别的核大国的“保护”而随人俯仰。这岂不是典型的弱肉强食主义吗？岂不是帮助帝国主义进行核讹诈吗？岂不是公开地不许别人革命吗？　　
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者硬说，核武器、火箭军决定一切，常规部队无足轻重，民兵不过是一堆肉。他们用这样的谬论来反对社会主义国家动员人民群众，依靠人民群众，准备用人民战争来对付帝国主义的侵略。他们把国家命运完全押在核武器这个赌注上，来同美帝国主义进行核赌博，进行政治买卖。他们的军事战略思想是唯核武器论。他们的建军路线是只见物、不见人，只要技术、不要政治的资产阶级建军路线。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者硬说，地球上任何星星之火都会引起世界核大战，会毁灭人类。按照他们这种论调，我们的地球早就不知道该毁灭多少次了。但是，战后二十年来，民族解放战争接连不断，究竟有那一次发展成为世界大战呢？难道不正是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放战争，打乱了美帝国主义发动世界战争的计划吗？相反地，那些千方百计地要扑灭人民战争“星星之火”的人，倒是助长了美帝国主义的侵略和战争气焰。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者硬说，只要实行他们的“和平共处、和平过渡、和平竞赛”的总路线，被压迫者就可以获得解放，就可以实现“没有武器、没有军队、没有战争的世界”。但是，无情的现实是，以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派都在狂热地加强战争机器，天天在血腥镇压革命人民，天天在武装侵犯和威胁已经取得独立的国家。赫鲁晓夫修正主义这一套已经在一些国家弄得大批人头落地，这样血的惨痛教训，难道还不够吗？赫鲁晓夫修正主义总路线的实质，不是别的，就是要被压迫人民和被压迫民族放下武器，要已经取得独立的国家放下武器，而在全副武装的美帝国主义及其走狗面前听任宰割。
    帝国主义、反动派是“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者接受了帝国主义这种哲学，他们对站在保卫世界和平最前列的中国人民说：“你们好战！”先生们，你们的这种辱骂，正是我们的光荣。我们这种“好战”，正是有利于制止帝国主义发动世界战争的。人民的这种“好战”，是为了保卫自己的，是帝国主义和反动派逼出来的，也是它们教会的。我们不过是以革命的“好战”，对付反革命的好战罢了。难道只许帝国主义及其走狗到处杀人，不许人民还手自卫和相互支援吗？世界上那里有这样的道理呢？赫鲁晓夫修正主义者把肯尼迪和约翰逊这些帝国主义者叫做“明智派”，把我们和一切敢于在帝国主义侵略面前实行武装自卫的人叫做“好战派”，这彻底暴露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是帝国主义强盗的帮凶。
    我们懂得，战争会给人民带来破坏、牺牲和痛苦。但是，如果不抵抗帝国主义的武装侵略，甘心作亡国奴，那么，遭受的破坏、牺牲和痛苦将会更加大得多。在革命战争中，少数人的牺牲，可以换来整个民族、整个国家以至整个人类的安全；一时的痛苦，可以换来长期的以至永久的和平与幸福。战争可以锻炼人民，推动历史的前进。从这个意义上来说，战争是伟大的学校。
    列宁在谈到第一次世界大战的时候说过：“战争使最文明的、文化最发达的国家陷于饥饿的境地。但是从另一方面来看，作为巨大的历史过程的战争又空前地加速了社会的发展。”?“战争唤醒了群众，以空前未有的惨祸和痛苦激起了他们。战争推动了历史，于是历史在现时就以火车头般的速度飞快前进。”?按照赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的说法，列宁岂不是最大的“好战分子”吗？
    同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的观点完全相反，马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，从来不用伤感的观点来看待战争。对于帝国主义发动的侵略战争，我们的态度历来非常明确：第一反对，第二不怕。谁进攻我们，我们就消灭谁。对于被压迫民族和被压迫人民所进行的革命战争，我们不仅不反对，而且从来都坚决支持，积极援助。过去如此，现在如此，在将来，随着我们力量的发展，这种支持和援助还要越来越加强。谁要是以为我们也会因为革命的胜利，建设的发展，家业的壮大，生活的改善，而丧失革命斗志，放弃世界革命事业，丢掉马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，那是白日作梦！当然，任何革命都是出于本国人民的要求。只有本国人民觉醒了，动员起来了，组织起来了，武装起来了，才能通过战斗，推翻帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，而不能由任何外国人来代替和包办。在这个意义上说，革命是不能输入的。但是，这并不排除世界各国革命人民在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中相互同情和支援。我们对各国革命人民的支援，正是有助于他们自力更生地进行斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所进行的反对人民战争的宣传，失败主义的宣传，投降主义的宣传，在全世界革命人民中，起着败坏士气的作用，起着从精神上解除武装的作用。他们干了美帝国主义自己所干不了的事情，帮了美帝国主义的大忙。他们大大鼓励了美帝国主义进行战争冒险。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者完全背叛马克思列宁主义关于战争的革命学说，成了人民战争的叛徒。
    全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民为了胜利地进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，为了胜利地进行人民战争，就必须坚决反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义。
    现在，在世界革命人民中间，赫鲁晓夫修正主义的市场是越来越小了。那里有帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略和武装镇压，那里就有反抗侵略和反抗压迫的人民战争。人民战争必将蓬勃发展，这是一条客观规律，既不以美帝国主义者的意志为转移，也不以赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的意志为转移。世界革命人民在前进的道路上是能够横扫一切的。赫鲁晓夫已经完蛋了，赫鲁晓夫修正主义的继承者也不会有好下场。反对人民战争的帝国主义、各国反动派和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，通通要被革命人民的铁扫帚从历史舞台上扫除干净。
    抗日战争胜利以后的二十年里，中国大变了，世界大变了，变得更加有利于世界革命人民，而更加不利于帝国主义及其走狗了。
    在日本帝国主义发动侵略中国的战争的时候，中国人民只有一支很小的人民军队和很小的一块革命根据地，而面对着的是一个东方的军事霸王。就是在那样的时候，毛泽东同志说，中国人民战争是可以胜利的，日本帝国主义是可以打倒的。今天，世界人民的革命根据地空前壮大，世界人民革命运动空前高涨，帝国主义空前衰弱，帝国主义的头子美帝国主义接连遭到了失败。我们更加可以满怀信心地说，各国的人民战争是能够胜利的，美帝国主义是能够打倒的。
    世界人民有了十月革命的经验，有了反法西斯战争的经验，有了中国人民抗日战争和解放战争的经验，有了朝鲜人民抗美战争的经验，有了越南人民解放战争和抗美战争的经验，还有了其他许多国家人民革命武装斗争的经验。只要善于研究这些经验，并且创造性地同本国革命的具体实践结合起来，那么，各国革命人民必将在各自国家的人民战争的舞台上，演出更加威武壮丽的史剧，最后把各国人民共同的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗通通埋葬掉。
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前全世界人民反美斗争的焦点。中国人民支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的决心，是坚定不移的。不管美帝国主义怎样扩大战争冒险，中国人民都要尽自己的力量支持越南人民，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出越南去。
    美帝国主义者现在叫嚷着要同中国人民再来一次较量，在亚洲大陆上再打一场大规模的地面战争。如果他们一定要走日本法西斯的老路，那么，好吧，随他们的便吧。中国人民自有对付美帝国主义侵略战争的办法。我们的办法并不是什么秘密，最重要的还是那么一条，就是动员人民，依靠人民，实行全民皆兵，进行人民战争。
    我们可以再一次奉告美帝国主义者，几亿拿起武器的中国人民所形成的汪洋大海，是足够容得下你们的几百万侵略军队的。要是你们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，那就给了我们行动的自由。到那个时候，战争怎么个打法，就由不得你们了。怎样有利于歼灭敌人，我们就怎样打。那里好歼灭敌人，我们就在那里打。既然中国人民在二十年前能够打败日本侵略者，那么今天，中国人民更加有把握把美国侵略者置于死地。你们炫耀海空优势，吓不倒中国人民。你们挥舞原子弹，也吓不倒中国人民。你们要派军队来，那就来吧，越多越好。你们来多少，我们就给你们报销多少，还可以给你们开个收条。中国人民是有伟大气魄的人民。我们敢于肩负起反抗美帝国主义的重担，在最后战胜这个全世界人民最凶恶的敌人的斗争中，作出自己的贡献。
    必须严正指出，抗日战争胜利以后，台湾已经归还中国。美帝国主义霸占台湾是毫无道理的。台湾省是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。美帝国主义必须从台湾滚出去。中国人民一定要解放台湾。
    在纪念抗日战争胜利二十周年的时候，我们还必须严正指出，在美帝国主义扶植下的日本军国主义者，如果不顾日本人民和亚洲人民的坚决反对，一定要重温旧梦，走上侵略亚洲的老路，那就必将遭到更加严厉的惩罚。
    美帝国主义正在准备一场世界战争。但是，这能救得了美帝国主义的命吗？第一次世界大战以后，出了一个社会主义的苏联。第二次世界大战以后，出了一系列社会主义国家，出了许多民族独立国家。如果美帝国主义一定要发动第三次世界大战，可以断言，其结果必定又有多少亿人口转到社会主义方面，帝国主义剩下的地盘就不多了，整个帝国主义制度也有可能全部崩溃了。
    我们对世界前途是乐观的。我们坚信，人类生活中的战争时代将由人民之手加以结束。毛泽东同志早就指出：战争这个怪物，“人类社会的发展终久要把它消灭的，而且就在不远的将来会要把它消灭的。但是消灭它的方法只有一个，就是用战争反对战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争”。?
    一切受美帝国主义侵略、压迫和掠夺的人民，团结起来，高举人民战争的正义旗帜，为世界和平、民族解放、人民民主和社会主义事业而斗争。胜利一定属于全世界人民！人民战争胜利万岁！注释：①　西安事变。国民党东北军将领张学良和第十七路军将领杨虎城，受中国工农红军和人民抗日运动的影响，同意中国共产党提出的抗日民族统一战线的主张，要求蒋介石停止内战，联共抗日。蒋介石拒绝了他们的要求。一九三六年十二月十二日，张、杨就在西安把蒋介石拘禁起来。事变发生后，中国共产党从民族利益出发，加以调停，使蒋介石被迫接受了联共抗日的条件。②　《为争取千百万群众进入抗日民族统一战线而斗争》，《毛泽东选集》第一卷，人民出版社一九五二年七月第一版（重排本），第二六六页。③　三三制政权，就是根据抗日民族统一战线的原则，在政权组织中，共产党员占三分之一，非党的进步分子占三分之一，中间派占三分之一。④　《目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题》，《毛泽东选集》第二卷，人民出版社一九五二年八月第一版（重排本），第七四○页。⑤　《中国革命和中国共产党》，《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第六二九页。⑥　《论联合政府》，《毛泽东选集》第三卷，人民出版社一九五三年五月第一版（重排本），第一○七四页。⑦　《一八五二年神圣同盟对法战争的可能性与展望》，《马克思恩格斯全集》第七卷，人民出版社一九五九年版，第五六二页。⑧　《论持久战》，《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第四三一页。⑨　麻雀战，是中国共产党领导下的敌后抗日游击队和民兵创造的一种群众性战法。叫做麻雀战这个名字，一是形容其广泛性，象麻雀满天飞，到处皆是；一是形容其灵活性，用三五成群、出没无常的行动，杀伤、消耗和疲惫敌人。⑩　《中国革命战争的战略问题》，《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第二三一页。?　《目前形势和我们的任务》，《毛泽东选集》第四卷，人民出版社一九六○年第一版，第一二四七页。?　《和中央社、扫荡报、新民报三记者的谈话》，《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第五七八页。?　《必须学会做经济工作》，《毛泽东选集》第三卷，第一○一五页。?　《资本论》第一卷，人民出版社一九六三年版，第八二八页。?　《战争和战略问题》，《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第五三五页。?　同上，第五二九页。?　《革命军队和革命政府》，《列宁全集》第八卷，人民出版社版， 第五三一页。?　《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》，《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一一二六——一一二七页。?　《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一一九三页。?　《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》（一九六四年十一月二十八日），《全世界人民团结起来打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗》，人民出版社一九六四年版，第十四页。?　《为了面包与和平》，《列宁全集》第二十六卷，第三六五页。?　《当前的主要任务》，《列宁全集》第二十七卷，第一四八页。?　《中国革命战争的战略问题》，《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第一六七页。
