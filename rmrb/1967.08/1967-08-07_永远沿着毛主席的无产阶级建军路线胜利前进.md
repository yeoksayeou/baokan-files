In the midst of the resounding victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has arrived. Looking back at the history of the Chinese revolution and the 40-year arduous struggle of our army, we, all the officers and soldiers, have an even deeper understanding that it is our great leader Chairman Mao who has led us to overcome various opportunist lines and domestic and foreign class enemies, advancing from victory to victory. We are filled with fighting spirit and enthusiastically proclaim: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Forty years ago, in the early days of our Party, Chairman Mao summarized the experiences and lessons of the workers and peasants in their struggle against imperialism and feudal forces, proposing that the Party should use its main forces to lead armed struggles, vigorously establish peasant armed forces, carry out land revolution, and establish revolutionary governments. The right-opportunist Er Chen refused to accept Chairman Mao's correct policies, gave up the leadership of armed forces, and even disbanded the revolutionary armed forces of the workers and peasants, hoping to maintain the united front with the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek through concessions and compromises. Therefore, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and carried out an unprecedented large-scale massacre of communists and revolutionary masses, the Party could not organize effective resistance, leading to the failure of the first domestic revolutionary war.

At this critical juncture of the revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized and rectified Er Chen's right-opportunist line. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the August 1st Nanchang Uprising in 1927 fired the first shot against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In September, based on the peasant movement in Hunan, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the historic Autumn Harvest Uprising, establishing the first new-type proletarian revolutionary army and opening up the first revolutionary base area in Jinggangshan. The Autumn Harvest Uprising was a great turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution, opening up the path for the Chinese revolution to advance towards victory. It was the first step in the Chinese revolutionary movement advancing towards victory under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our Ninth Company participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising and is a company personally established by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan. Under the heavy encirclement and suppression of the enemy, our company has always fought hard to open up the Jinggangshan base area and establish the red political power of the Central Soviet Area. In the revolutionary fire, we were tempered and became a main force company of the famous "Model Red Fifth Regiment." After four campaigns of counter-encirclement, the Red Army and the base area in the Central Soviet Area developed significantly, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line shone with brilliant light.

Due to the erroneous leadership of the "Left" opportunist line, the Fifth Campaign of Counter-Encirclement failed, and the Red Army was in danger. During the Long March, the Zunyi Conference was held, correcting the erroneous leadership of the "Left" opportunist line and establishing the correct leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This turned the development of the Red Army and the Chinese revolution onto the correct track. Our company, at this great turning point in history, firmly stood on Chairman Mao's side, overcame countless difficulties, and followed Chairman Mao through the 25,000-li Long March to reach the anti-Japanese front in Shaanxi.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our army, under the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and the direct command of Comrade Lin Biao, crossed the Yellow River to the east, fought the first battle at Pingxingguan, and annihilated more than 3,000 elite troops of the Japanese invaders' Sakai Division, greatly boosting the confidence of the Chinese people in winning the war of resistance. In this battle, our company was the first to charge into the enemy's ranks, engaging in close combat with the Japanese invaders and annihilating an entire enemy platoon. We were awarded the title of "Pingxingguan Battle Shock Company." Later, when we established the Ji-Lu Border Anti-Japanese Base Area, we strictly followed Chairman Mao's instructions, armed the people, and developed a powerful anti-Japanese guerrilla war, fighting many brilliant battles. At the same time, we expanded and developed ten companies, earning the title of "Revolutionary Mother Hen Company" from the masses and being awarded the title of "Double Victory Company."

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, secretly ordered his troops to prepare for civil war, and on the other hand, took advantage of the domestic and international people's desire for peace, playing tricks with peace talks. He used the slogans of "peace," "democracy," and "legal status" to try to deceive us into handing over the people's armed forces and the people's political power in the liberated areas, seizing the fruits of the people's victory.

At this critical historical juncture, the question was whether to continue armed struggle, overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and establish a new China led by the proletariat, or to hand over the people's armed forces to Chiang Kai-shek, keeping China as a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country under the rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Within our Party, there were two fundamentally opposed lines. At this crucial moment, our great leader Chairman Mao, representing the will of hundreds of millions of people, proposed a policy of resolute struggle and inch-by-inch struggle, clearly warning the entire Party: "The people's armed forces, every gun and bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." "If there is any opportunism in this period, it is to not struggle and voluntarily hand over the fruits that the people should have to Chiang Kai-shek." However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao. He inherited the legacy of the old right-opportunist Er Chen and Wang Ming, adapting to Chiang Kai-shek's needs, actively promoting a line of capitulation within the Party. In 1945, when Chairman Mao went to Chongqing for negotiations, he took charge of the central work and immediately issued an editorial through the Party newspaper, begging the American imperialists and their running dogs for "peace," spreading illusions of peace, and numbing the revolutionary people. After the Old Political Consultative Conference resolution was passed, he vigorously advocated that "from now on, China has entered a new stage of peace and democracy," "the main form of the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle," shouting about "letting the military take a step forward, the whole country will make great progress," "the entire work of the Party must undergo a transformation." He wanted the entire Party to abandon armed struggle and seek "legal status," engage in "parliamentary struggle."

From Chairman Mao's teachings and countless struggles, we deeply understand: the people's armed forces are the lifeline of the people and must not be handed over to the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek; the base areas opened up by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army through bloody struggles are the bases for revolutionary victory and the hope of the oppressed people worldwide, and not a single inch can be easily given up; the Kuomintang reactionary government, stained with the blood of the Chinese people, is a heinous counter-revolutionary regime that must be overthrown without any illusions; the hundreds of millions of laboring people under the rule of the Kuomintang are suffering in deep waters and fiery pits, and we must help them achieve liberation. Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought did not listen to the treacherous capitulationist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, tightly gripping their guns, and resolutely joining the war to defend the people's victory and overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

In September 1945, when the Chongqing talks were underway and the Chinese Khrushchev was spreading illusions of peace, Chiang Kai-shek secretly ordered his troops to launch a large-scale attack on our Shanxi Upper Party region and the Zhengzhou and Xinxiang regions along the Pinghan Line. Due to our army's heightened revolutionary vigilance, as soon as the enemy attacked, they were met with a head-on counterattack. Our company, participating in the Pinghan Campaign, served as the shock company, directly attacking the headquarters of the Kuomintang's 40th Army, destroying the enemy's command center, and cooperating with the militia to capture the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone Deputy Commander and 40th Army Commander Ma Fawu. We were awarded the title of "Main Attack Company of the Pinghan Campaign." Later, when Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale attack on our army, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely counterattacked. After three years of hard fighting, we finally shook the foundations of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. On New Year's Day 1949, Chiang Kai-shek played a new trick, issuing a hypocritical call for peace. Chairman Mao's great call to "carry the revolution through to the end" exposed this new trick. In the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, our Ninth Company was the first to break through the Yangtze River barrier, covering the troops' successful crossing, and was awarded the honorable title of "Yangtze River Crossing Hero Company."

The victory of the three-year Liberation War was a victory of Mao Zedong Thought over the capitulationist line represented by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party. It was a great victory of the thought that "the central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle and solve problems through war" over the so-called legal struggle, parliamentary road, and other revisionist thoughts.

After more than twenty years of armed struggle, we finally overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary rule with the gun, establishing a proletarian revolutionary government. After the national victory, our military construction entered a new historical period, transitioning from a single-armed force to a modern, multi-armed composite force. At this time, the question of whether to emphasize proletarian politics and strengthen the political and ideological work of the military is a continuation of the two-line struggle under new conditions.

The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Domestic and foreign class enemies, in order to subvert our proletarian revolutionary government, always try to sabotage and corrupt our army, aiming to dismantle and seize our army. However, the class enemies know that directly using force to dismantle our army is impossible, so they use various means to corrupt our army ideologically, making it degenerate and change color. Chairman Mao, even before the national victory, warned us: "There may be some communists who have not been defeated by enemies with guns, who are heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Chairman Mao's wise instructions have pointed the direction for the military to strengthen political work, carry out ideological transformation of the troops, and build the military.

However, the anti-party elements and great schemer Peng Dehuai, who held important military leadership positions at that time, with the support of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, went against the current, stubbornly promoting a bourgeois military line. He only talked about modernization and did not talk about revolutionization, saying that the modernization of the military is mainly about solving the contradiction between people and technology; modern warfare is about technology, steel, and machinery, and in front of these things, the role of people should be relegated to the second position. He even publicly slandered political work as "selling fake medicine," proposing to abolish political cadres and establish a one-person system. He also vigorously advocated material incentives, such as military rank system, promotion system, vacation system, etc., attempting to turn the people's army, personally created and cultivated by Chairman Mao, into a tool for restoring capitalism, realizing his evil goal of usurping the Party and the military.

This bourgeois military line had a very bad impact on the troops and was strongly opposed by the broad masses of officers and soldiers. The Lushan Conference presided over by Chairman Mao smashed Peng Dehuai's plot to usurp the Party and the military and removed his position. Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission, he has most resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought, creatively proposing the Four Firsts, the Three-Eight Style, promoting the Three Great Democracies, and carrying out the Four Good Companies movement. In 1960, the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, based on Vice Chairman Lin's thoughts, made the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Military." We followed the direction indicated by Vice Chairman Lin's instructions and the Military Commission's resolution, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and focusing on reforming the worldviews of cadres and soldiers, further carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of the company. In 1964, our company was awarded the honorable title of "Model Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" by the Ministry of National Defense. Batch after batch of young people from the countryside, factories, and schools, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the revolutionary furnace of the Liberation Army, quickly grew into conscious revolutionary soldiers.

Insisting on Chairman Mao's consistent emphasis on building the military politically, emphasizing politics, and emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for our military to remain revolutionary and never degenerate. Without politics, it is equivalent to losing the soul and direction. Therefore, all those who attempt to usurp the Party and the military always strongly oppose emphasizing politics and Mao Zedong Thought. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai did this, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing also did this.

Luo Ruiqing is a conspirator and schemer who is anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. He colluded with the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, frantically opposing Mao Zedong Thought and openly opposing Vice Chairman Lin. He extremely hated Mao Zedong Thought, saying that treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive "does not conform to our country's system." He shamelessly attacked the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought. He promoted a series of opportunist fallacies in the entire military, such as large-scale competitions, emphasizing technology, and emphasizing bourgeois show-offism, using these to resist Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's teachings on emphasizing proletarian politics and insisting on the Four Firsts, weakening and disintegrating our proletarian army. Luo Ruiqing's revisionist goods were resisted and opposed by our company from the beginning. No matter how great the obstacles were at that time, we always put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place and put reforming people's ideology in the first place. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, this counter-revolutionary revisionist was exposed and his plot to usurp the Party and the military was smashed. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

"History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." Over the decades, the proletarian military line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois military line have gone through one struggle after another, smashing one plot to usurp the Party and the military after another. History has proven that Chairman Mao's military line is the most complete, most scientific, and greatest proletarian military line, and is the strongest weapon for the people of the world to defeat imperialism and all class enemies.

Now, an unprecedented large-scale movement of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party is surging across the country. This is a great decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Vice Chairman Lin told us: "We, the cadres and communists working in the military, must always be vigilant against the enemy's tricks: be vigilant against the invasion of enemies with guns, and be vigilant against various 'sugar-coated bullets' and internal sabotage." From the practice of the two-line struggle, we understand that this internal sabotage is mainly from the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the military and the bourgeois military line they promote. Once the time is ripe, they will seize military power, seize political power, and turn the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. They are our most dangerous and main enemies.

We must carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and together with the revolutionary leftists, expose, criticize, and struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party, the government, and the military, thoroughly eliminating the revisionist poison they have spread in various fields. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and love the people," learn from the broad leftist masses, and complete the great tasks of "three supports and two militaries." In the great waves of class struggle, we will turn the troops into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and let our great socialist motherland forever shine with the light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线胜利前进
    中国人民解放军某部红九连
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得震撼世界的伟大胜利的凯歌声中，中国人民解放军建军节四十周年到来了。回顾中国革命的历史，回顾我军四十年艰苦奋战的历程，我们全体指战员更加深刻地体会到，是我们伟大的统帅毛主席，领着我们战胜各种机会主义路线，战胜国内外的阶级敌人，从胜利走向胜利。我们满怀战斗的激情，热烈欢呼：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    四十年前，在我们党的幼年时期，毛主席总结了工农群众同帝国主义、封建势力进行斗争的经验教训，提出党要以主要力量领导武装斗争，大力建立农民武装，实行土地革命，建立革命政权。右倾机会主义分子陈独秀拒绝接受毛主席的正确方针，放弃了对武装力量的领导权，甚至解散工农群众的革命武装，幻想以屈从退让来保持同国民党蒋介石的统一战线。因此，当蒋介石叛变革命，对共产党人和革命群众实行空前规模的大屠杀的时候，党不能组织有效的抵抗，使轰轰烈烈的第一次国内革命战争遭到了失败。
    在这革命的危急关头，我们伟大的领袖毛主席彻底批判和清算了陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线。在毛泽东思想指引下，一九二七年举行的“八一”南昌起义，打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪。九月，在湖南农民运动的基础上，毛主席亲自发动和领导了具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义，建立起第一支新型的无产阶级革命军队，在井冈山开辟了第一个革命根据地。秋收起义是中国革命历史的一个伟大转折，它开辟了中国革命胜利前进的道路，是中国革命运动在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下走向胜利的第一步。
    我们九连是参加秋收起义的革命武装，是毛主席在井冈山亲手创立的连队。在敌人重重“围剿”下，我们连队始终为开辟井冈山根据地、建立中央苏区的红色政权而艰苦奋战，在革命的烈火中得到了锻炼，成为著名的“模范红五团”的一个主力连队。经过四次反“围剿”斗争，中央苏区的红军和根据地得到很大的发展，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线闪耀出万丈光芒。
    由于“左”倾机会主义路线的错误领导，使第五次反“围剿”遭到失败，红军处于危险之中。在长征途中，召开了遵义会议，纠正了“左”倾机会主义的错误领导，确立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的正确领导，使红军和中国革命的发展，从此走上了正确的轨道。我们连，在这伟大转折的历史关头，坚决站在毛主席一边，克服千难万险，紧跟毛主席，经过二万五千里长征，到达陕北抗日前线。
    抗日战争爆发后，我军根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，在林彪同志的直接指挥下，东渡黄河，首战平型关，一举歼灭日寇侵华精锐坂垣师团三千多人，大大振奋了全国人民抗战胜利的信心。在这次战斗中，我们连首先冲入敌阵，和日寇展开了白刃格斗，歼敌一个中队，荣获“平型关大战突击连”的称号。以后，我们连在创立冀鲁边区抗日根据地的时候，坚决按照毛主席的指示，武装人民，发展强大的抗日游击战争，打了许多出色的仗，同时，还发展扩大了十个连队，被群众誉为“革命的老母鸡连队”，荣获“军政双胜连”称号。
    抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石一方面下密令，调军队，积极准备打内战，一方面利用国内外人民的和平愿望，玩弄和谈阴谋。他打着“和平”、“民主”、“合法地位”等幌子，妄想诱惑我们交出人民武装，交出解放区的人民政权，夺取人民的胜利果实。
    在这历史的紧要关头，是继续坚持武装斗争，推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新中国，还是把人民武装拱手送给蒋介石，使中国仍然成为大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？在我们党内存在着两条根本对立的路线。我们伟大领袖毛主席在这关键时刻，代表亿万人民的意志，提出了针锋相对，寸土必争的方针，明确地告诫全党：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石。”可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却公然与毛主席相对抗。他继承老右倾机会主义分子陈独秀、王明的衣钵，适应蒋介石的需要，积极在党内推行投降主义路线。一九四五年，毛主席去重庆谈判，他主持中央工作，马上就通过党报发表社论，向美帝国主义及其走狗乞求“和平”，散布和平幻想，麻痹革命人民。旧政协决议通过后，他竭力鼓吹什么“从此中国走上和平民主的新阶段”，“中国革命主要斗争形势已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争，和议会斗争”，叫嚷什么“军队让一步，全国大进步”，“党的全部工作要实行转变”。他要全党放弃武装斗争，去争取“合法地位”，搞“议会斗争”。
    我们从毛主席的教导里，从无数次斗争的实践中，深深地体会到：人民武装是人民的命根子，决不能拱手送给人民公敌蒋介石；八路军、新四军浴血奋战开辟的根据地，是革命胜利的基地，是全世界被压迫人民的希望，决不能轻易让出一寸；沾满中国人民鲜血的国民党反动政权，是万恶不赦的反革命王朝，决不能对它抱任何幻想，一定要把它推翻；在国民党统治下的亿万劳动人民，处在水深火热之中，一定要帮助他们求得解放。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，没有听信中国赫鲁晓夫那套亡党、亡军、亡国的投降主义谬论，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧握手中枪，坚决投入保卫人民的胜利果实、推翻国民党反动统治的解放战争中去。
    一九四五年九月，正当重庆谈判、中国的赫鲁晓夫散布和平幻想的时候，蒋介石密令他的军队，大举进犯我山西上党地区和平汉线的郑州、新乡地区。由于我军提高了革命警惕，因此，当敌人刚一进犯，就遭到了迎头痛击。我们连在参加平汉战役中，担任突击连，直捣国民党四十军军部，打烂敌人指挥机关，配合民兵，活捉了国民党第十一战区副司令长官兼四十军军长马法五，被授予“平汉战役主攻连”称号。以后，蒋介石向我军发动了全面进攻，我们又按照毛主席的教导，坚决反击。经过三年的奋战，终于彻底动摇了国民党的反动统治。一九四九年元旦，蒋介石又耍新阴谋，发表了虚伪的求和声明。毛主席发出的“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，使全党和全国人民识破了这个新阴谋。在渡江战役中，我们九连先行突破长江天险，掩护部队胜利过江，又被授予“渡江英雄连”的光荣称号。
    三年解放战争的胜利，是毛泽东思想战胜以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的投降主义的胜利，是“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”的伟大思想，战胜所谓合法斗争、议会道路等修正主义思想的伟大胜利。
    经过二十多年的武装斗争，终于用枪杆子推翻了国民党反动统治，建立了无产阶级革命政权。全国胜利后，我们军队建设进入了新的历史时期，由单一兵种过渡到现代化的多兵种合成军队。在这时，还要不要突出无产阶级政治，要不要加强军队政治思想工作，这是两条路线斗争在新的条件下的继续。
    人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石。国内外的阶级敌人，为了颠覆我国无产阶级革命政权，总是要破坏和腐蚀我们的军队，搞垮和夺取我们的军队。但是，阶级敌人知道，直接用武力搞垮我们这支军队，是办不到的，因此，便想方设法通过各种途径从思想上腐蚀我们的军队，使其变质变色。毛主席早在全国胜利前夕，就谆谆告诫我们：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”毛主席的英明指示，为军队加强政治工作、搞好部队的思想革命化、军队建设指明了方向。
    但是，当时窃据了重要军事领导职务的反党分子、大野心家彭德怀，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，却反其道而行之，顽固地推行一条资产阶级军事路线。他只讲现代化，不讲革命化，说什么军队搞现代化建设，主要是解决人与技术的矛盾；现代战争打的是技术、是钢铁、是机械，在这些东西面前，人的作用要退居到第二位。他甚至公然诬蔑做政治工作是“卖狗皮膏药”，提出要取消政治干部，建立一长制。他还大力提倡物质刺激，什么军衔制度、晋级晋衔制度、休假制度等等，妄图把毛主席亲手缔造和培育起来的人民军队，变成复辟资本主义的工具，实现他篡党篡军的罪恶目的。
    这条资产阶级军事路线在部队造成了极恶劣的影响，遭到广大指战员的激烈反对。毛主席主持的庐山会议，粉碎了彭德怀篡党篡军的阴谋，罢了他的官。一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林副主席主持中央军委工作以来，最坚决地贯彻了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想，创造性地提出了四个第一，提出了三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。一九六○年，军委扩大会议根据林副主席的思想，作出了《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》。我们按照林副主席的指示和军委决议所指引的方向，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓干部、战士世界观的改造，使连队的光荣传统进一步得到了发扬光大。一九六四年，我们连荣获国防部授予“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的光荣称号。一批又一批来自农村、工厂、学校的青年，在毛泽东思想哺育下，在解放军的革命熔炉中，迅速成长为自觉的革命战士。
    坚持毛主席一贯强调的从政治上建军的思想，突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，是保证我们军队永远革命，永不变质的根本。脱离了政治，就等于失掉了灵魂，失掉了方向。所以，凡是妄图篡党篡军的坏家伙，总是极力地反对突出政治，反对毛泽东思想。反革命修正主义分子彭德怀是这样干的，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿也是这样干的。
    罗瑞卿是一个反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的阴谋家、野心家。他和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派互相勾结，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，公开地同林副主席唱反调。他极端仇视毛泽东思想，胡说什么把毛主席的书当作最高指示“不符合我们国家的体制”。他肆无忌惮地攻击当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。他在全军搞什么大比武，突出技术，突出资产阶级的风头主义，散布一套折中主义即机会主义的谬论，以此来抵制毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一的教导，削弱和瓦解我们的无产阶级军队。罗瑞卿的这些修正主义货色，一开始就遭到我们连队的抵制和反对。不管当时的阻力有多大，我们始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，把搞好人的思想革命化放在第一位。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，这个反革命修正主义分子被识破了，被揭露出来了，他的篡党篡军阴谋被粉碎了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    “历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”几十年来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级军事路线与资产阶级军事路线，经过了一次又一次的斗争，粉碎了一个又一个篡党篡军阴谋。历史证明，毛主席的军事路线，是最完整、最科学、最伟大的无产阶级军事路线，是世界人民战胜帝国主义和一切阶级敌人的最强大的武器。
    现在，一个规模空前的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮，正在全国兴起。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一场大决战。林副主席告诉我们说：“我们在军队工作的干部和共产党员，必须时时刻刻警惕敌人的阴谋：既警惕拿枪的敌人的进犯，又警惕各种‘糖衣炮弹’和来自内部的破坏。”我们从两条路线斗争的实践中认识到，这种来自内部的破坏，最主要的就是来自混进军队里的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所推行的资产阶级军事路线。一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取军权，夺取政权，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。他们是我们最危险、最主要的敌人。
    我们一定要发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和革命左派一起，把混进党里、政府里、军队里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，统统揪出来，批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们在各个领域中散布的修正主义流毒。我们一定要响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，向左派广大群众学习，完成“三支”、“两军”的伟大任务。在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，把部队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让我们伟大的社会主义祖国永远放射毛泽东思想的光芒！
