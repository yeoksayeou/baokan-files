The rapid development of the people's armed struggle in northeastern Thailand has caused great alarm among the Thai reactionaries. A recent report from the "Army Department" of the Thanom puppet government admits that the Thai people's armed forces have significantly intensified their offensive activities in late July, particularly in the Nakhon Phanom and Sakhon Nakhon provinces, where they have launched attacks against enemy forces, eliminated traitors, and suppressed local tyrants, displaying "remarkable activity." In the first five months of this year, the people's armed forces in northeastern Thailand have engaged in nearly a hundred battles with reactionary military and police forces, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers.

The northeastern region of Thailand, comprising the provinces of Udon Thani, Kalasin, Nakhon Phanom, Sakhon Nakhon, Ubon Ratchathani, Loei, and Lopburi, has a population of ten million, accounting for one-third of Thailand's total population. The farmers there have deep grievances, having long suffered under the cruel exploitation of reactionary rulers. Consequently, the demand for revolution is most urgent, and revolutionary enthusiasm is at its highest. Additionally, the terrain is rugged, with dense forests and poor transportation, making it difficult for reactionary forces to fully control the area, which has long been considered a "dangerous region" by the ruling class.

The armed struggle ignited by the Thai Communist Party in this region two years ago has quickly spread throughout northeastern Thailand, growing into a raging inferno. Over the past two years, the people's armed forces have employed flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to thwart the reactionary U.S.-Thai forces' multiple "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, rapidly growing stronger in the process. In July of last year, the Thanom clique mobilized six battalions of troops, along with the police, under the command of invading U.S. forces, deploying aircraft, tanks, and artillery to suppress the people's armed forces in Udon Thani. However, they suffered a complete defeat under the fierce counterattack of the people's armed forces.

According to incomplete statistics, from August 1965 to the end of May this year, the people's armed forces in northeastern Thailand have engaged in over 250 battles and propaganda activities with the enemy, killing and wounding 730 enemy soldiers, including dozens of reactionary military and police officers below the rank of colonel, and at least five U.S. invaders. The reactionary leader of Sakhon Nakhon Province, Phol Thep Srivisarn, recently admitted to a U.S. journalist, "The situation in Sakhon Nakhon Province is very bad," with 90% of the villages being "areas of communist activity." The Thanom reactionary government's head of logistics, Sunthorn Wannapong, also exclaimed that the activities of the Thai people's armed forces have made it difficult for U.S. troops to transport weapons to their bases in northeastern Thailand.

    泰国东北部人民武装越战越强
    今年头五个月内同反动军警作战近百次
    本报讯　泰国东北部人民武装斗争的迅速发展，使泰国反动派十分惊恐。他侬傀儡政府“陆军署”最近发表的报告承认，泰国人民武装力量在七月下旬显著加强了出击活动，在东北部地区的那空拍侬和沙功那空府一带袭击敌伪，锄奸反霸，“十分活跃”。在今年头五个月内，东北部人民武装曾同反动军警交战近百次，歼敌百余名。
    泰国东北部地区的乌汶、加拉信、那空拍侬、沙功那空、乌隆、廊开和黎府等府，居民一千万人，占泰国总人口的三分之一。那里的农民苦大仇深，自古以来就遭受到反动统治者的残酷压榨，因而革命的要求最迫切，革命积极性也最高。同时，这一带的地势险要，深山密林，交通不便，反动派的统治势力难于完全控制，一向被统治集团视为“危险地区”。
    泰国共产党领导的人民武装两年前在这里点燃的武装斗争的星星之火，很快就在整个东北部迅速蔓延开来，发展成为燎原之势。两年来，人民武装运用机动灵活的战略战术，粉碎了美泰反动派的多次“围剿”，在战斗中迅速成长壮大。去年七月间，他侬集团曾经调动六个营的军队，加上警察，在美国侵略军的指挥下，出动飞机、坦克、大炮，对乌汶府的人民武装进行反革命“围剿”。但是在人民武装的迎头痛击之下遭到了彻底的破产。
    据不完全统计，从一九六五年八月到今年五月底，东北部人民武装曾经同敌人作战和对群众展开宣传活动二百五十多次，打死打伤敌人七百三十名，包括校级以下的反动军警官员几十人，其中还有美国侵略者至少五名。沙功那空府的反动头子波铃·章达盛在最近向美国记者承认：“沙功那空府的局势非常糟糕”，那里百分之九十的村庄都是“共产党活动的地区”。他侬反动政府负责物资运输工作的头目顺他暖更是惊呼：泰国人民武装的活动已经使美国驻军向东北部美军基地运送武器造成了困难。（附图片）
