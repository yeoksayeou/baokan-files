The great criticism of the revolution is the key to holding power properly. To carry out a revolutionary great criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao. This is a major measure to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters politically, ideologically, and theoretically. It is also the fundamental key for us revolutionaries to hold power properly and use power properly. We must not take this lightly.

The revolutionary great criticism is a major matter concerning which road the proletarian revolutionaries will take after seizing power. The essence of the struggle between the two lines within the Party is the question of which road China will take. The essence of the entire set of reactionary bourgeois lines long promoted by China's Khrushchev is to take the capitalist road. After the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, if we do not carry out a revolutionary great criticism of this entire set of reactionary bourgeois lines and thoroughly eliminate its poisonous influence, we will not be able to distinguish between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary bourgeois line; between the socialist road and the capitalist road; between revolution and reform; between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and the revisionism that waves the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. On this series of fundamental and major issues, if we lose our ability to discern, then in our future work and struggle, we may unknowingly execute the reactionary bourgeois line and unknowingly take the capitalist road.

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    革命大批判是掌好权的关键
    对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命的大批判，是毛主席的伟大的战略部署。这是从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的重大措施，也是我们无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权的根本关键，切切不可等闲视之。
    革命的大批判是关系到无产阶级革命派夺权后走什么道路的大事。党内两条路线斗争的本质就是中国走什么道路的问题。中国的赫鲁晓夫长期推行的一整套资产阶级反动路线的本质，就是走资本主义道路。无产阶级革命派掌权之后，如果不对这一整套资产阶级反动路线进行革命的大批判，不彻底肃清它的流毒，我们就会分不清什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线；什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路；什么是革命，什么是改良；什么是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，什么是打着“红旗”反红旗的修正主义。在这一系列根本性的重大问题上，如果我们丧失辨别能力，那么，我们在今后的工作中、斗争中，就可能不知不觉地执行资产阶级反动路线，不知不觉地走上资本主义道路。（《解放日报》八月二十八日社论）
