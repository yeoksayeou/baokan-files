Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the nation have risen up with a thousand-pound hammer, using both words and pens, to launch a massive revolutionary criticism movement against the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party. This movement aims to thoroughly expose and settle accounts with their counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes, and to eliminate their poisonous influence in all areas. This is an extremely important and great strategic task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all sides." The biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party are the representatives of the restoration of capitalism. It was they who, taking advantage of the three years of natural disasters in the country, collaborated with the anti-China tide internationally, and stirred up a black wind of restoring capitalism, attempting to lead our great socialist motherland down the capitalist road to death. A small group of capitalism-roaders within the original Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee actively promoted and sold his counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, engaging in large-scale capitalist restoration activities in Shanxi Province, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

After the land reform, where should the countryside go, and how can farmers achieve common prosperity? Chairman Mao pointed out: "The vast majority of farmers across the country, in order to escape poverty, improve their lives, and resist disasters, must unite and advance towards the socialist road to achieve their goals." However, the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party went in the opposite direction, advocating the development of the rich peasant economy and opposing collectivization. During the three years of difficulty, they vigorously advocated "retreat in agriculture, including contracting production to households and individual farming," "the free market must continue," and "do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism." Their agents in Shanxi Province treated these words as gospel and strived to implement them.

The small group of capitalism-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party actively promoted contracting production to households, encouraged individual farming, and expanded private plots. They personally led teams to the countryside to "stay and work," experimenting with contracting production to households, and even said, "Now it should be like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their skills." In Xixian County, they promoted the "public-private field system" (i.e., dividing land to households, private field income for oneself, public field income for the collective) as an "advanced experience," spreading it everywhere. Therefore, in Jinzhong, there appeared Xiyang County's "contracting production to households," Xiyang County's "contracting production to teams," Fenyang County's individual farming, Pingyao County's "five big transfers," etc. On one hand, they expanded private plots to undermine the foundations of the socialist collective economy, and on the other hand, they used various methods to encourage private individuals to freely open up wasteland, requiring county, commune, and brigade cadres to take turns returning home to farm their small plots.

At the same time, they opened up free markets and vigorously supported speculative activities. What is even more intolerable is that the small group of capitalism-roaders within the original Jinzhong Regional Committee, in order to reduce procurement tasks, falsified reports, and repeatedly lowered the reported grain production figures of various counties to the level before collectivization, and allocated hidden grain production figures to various counties. As a result, the state's grain procurement was greatly reduced, while a large amount of grain flowed into the free market through private hands. Under their instigation and protection, speculative activities were once rampant.

These bad elements opposed political leadership and vigorously promoted material incentives and work points as the guiding principle. In Xiyang County, they implemented the "double reward and punishment system for labor days," which was exactly this kind of thing.

Their wanton capitalist restoration activities temporarily filled Jinzhong with dark clouds, seriously damaging the socialist collective economy, the socialist construction of the state, the alliance between workers and peasants, and affecting the lives of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The small group of capitalism-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party, in order to realize their dream of restoring capitalism, fiercely opposed the advanced red flag of the national agricultural front—the Dazhai Brigade.

Dazhai is a red flag personally raised by our great leader Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Dazhai relied on collective strength, worked hard, and self-reliantly transformed a poor mountain village into a new socialist Dazhai. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The small group of capitalism-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Party feared and hated Mao Zedong Thought to the core. Therefore, they saw Dazhai as a thorn in their side and a thorn in their flesh, using various means to oppose the high-holding of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in Dazhai.

In 1960, when various places suffered from disasters and grain production decreased, Dazhai achieved a bumper harvest in the disaster year, with an average of over 3,000 jin of surplus grain sold to the state per household. The small group of capitalism-roaders within the original Jinzhong Regional Committee and Xiyang County Committee not only did not publicize and promote Dazhai's advanced experience but also spread rumors that Dazhai's achievements were not genuine, saying, "How can the land be so bad and produce so much grain?" They then sent people to Dazhai to investigate the land, production, and completion of state procurement tasks. The facts shattered their conspiracy, and they then slandered Dazhai, saying that the land had been increased by leveling, forcing Comrade Chen Yonggui to lower the production figures, and insisting on reducing the actual production of 620 jin per mu to 580 jin, in order to strike at the masses' enthusiasm for building socialism, negate the superiority of the socialist collective economy, and blacken the red flag of Dazhai.

In 1961, they opposed Comrade Chen Yonggui everywhere, spreading the theory that "labor models should be suspected" and rumors that "Dazhai was built up by Chen Yonggui's speeches." They slandered Comrade Chen Yonggui's struggle against their capitalist restoration behavior as "arrogance," "disrespect for leadership," "creating an independent kingdom," "bad attitude towards superiors," and so on.

In October 1964, they took advantage of the opportunity to carry out the socialist education movement in the countryside and struck at Dazhai. The work team they sent to Dazhai faithfully implemented the "left in form, right in essence" reactionary line of the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party, arbitrarily labeling the Dazhai Brigade, which insisted on the socialist road, as a third-class brigade with serious problems, saying, "The more advanced, the bigger the problem." "The red flag of Dazhai has worms, and if the worms are not dug out, the red flag cannot be raised high." From the beginning of the movement, they directed the struggle spearhead at the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary grassroots cadres. They fabricated some "four unclears" for the cadres out of thin air, forcing the poor and lower-middle peasants to speak ill of the cadres, and maliciously inciting the relationship between cadres and the masses. For those poor and lower-middle peasants who resisted and opposed them, they politically persecuted them with the names of "current counter-revolutionaries" and "degenerate elements."

At the same time, they organized a "survey team" of more than seventy people from the province, region, county, commune, and surrounding brigades to repeatedly survey and harass for more than fifty days. The result was that they were greatly disappointed. The land in Dazhai was not only not more than the reported figures but was actually several mu less. The grain production in 1964 was rechecked and weighed, and there was not a single jin of over-reporting. The procurement figures were also consistent after being checked from top to bottom. The iron facts once again shattered their conspiracy.

The work team, in accordance with the will of the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party, seized the party and government power of Dazhai. All cadres were sidelined, and they commanded and controlled everything, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, boosting the arrogance of the rich, bad, and counter-revolutionaries, and suppressing the spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants. For nearly two and a half months, they did nothing good but caused endless trouble.

Chairman Mao understood us the best and cared for us the most. At the critical moment of the struggle, he received Comrade Chen Yonggui in Beijing and made important instructions on the work of Dazhai. Chairman Mao also issued the great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" to the whole country. This was the greatest encouragement, the most intimate care, and the strongest support for us. Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Twenty-three Articles," declaring the bankruptcy of the "left in form, right in essence" reactionary line of the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party. This greatly bolstered our confidence and courage. We drove away the work team that opposed Dazhai. Under the direct participation of the Central Committee, the Dazhai Party Branch and the broad masses of commune members carried out the "Four Clean-ups" together. After more than a month of work, it was proven that Dazhai was acting in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee in all aspects of politics, ideology, organization, and economy, and was indeed a tested and advanced red flag on the national agricultural front.

However, the small group of capitalism-roaders within the Party were not willing to admit defeat. During the National People's Congress, they sent people to Dazhai to secretly collect materials on Comrade Chen Yonggui, spreading rumors that Dazhai hid land and over-reported production, and reporting this material to the Central Committee to frame Comrade Chen Yonggui.

In order to resist the political influence of Dazhai, they vigorously promoted brigades that started with capitalism and modified production figures as models, spreading and promoting them everywhere to gain political capital.

These bad elements also extremely hated the advanced experiences created by revolutionary cadres and the masses. The advanced deeds of cadres at all four levels in Xiyang County participating in collective production labor were personally affirmed by Chairman Mao. They not only did not insist on and promote this, but on the contrary, they went to great lengths to negate it, openly opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The small group of capitalism-roaders within the original Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee carried out ruthless political framing against revolutionary cadres who resisted their capitalist restoration activities. After careful planning, they fabricated the shocking so-called "October Counter-Revolutionary Incident" in 1964. They used all means to label Ren Jingfu, Wang Zhenguo, Zhang Huaiying, and several hundred related people as an "anti-Party clique," with some being expelled from the Party, dismissed from their posts, and sent for labor reform, some being arrested and imprisoned, and some being surrounded and struggled against, with even their relatives and messengers not being spared. Their actions were extremely vicious and shocking. Their methods were opposed by Comrade Chen Yonggui, and therefore, they slandered Comrade Chen Yonggui as the "cane" of the "anti-Party clique," attempting to label him as a member of the "anti-Party clique."

The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Shanxi Province and Jinzhong has never stopped. Although we have been opposed, persecuted, and attacked by the small group of capitalism-roaders within the Party, with the encouragement of Chairman Mao and the support of the broad revolutionary masses and cadres, we have never stopped struggling with them. On the question of which road to take and which line to execute, whether to support Dazhai or oppose Dazhai, we have always been confrontational and unyielding.

We resolutely resisted the "three selfs and one contract" counter-revolutionary revisionist goods vigorously advocated by the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party. While other places expanded "small freedoms" and caused trouble, Dazhai focused on improving collective production and expanding the socialist collective economy. All commune members were in the collective and had their hearts in the collective, firmly advancing along the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao. Because the socialist collective economy developed, support for the state also became greater. Dazhai sold more grain to the state each year, and the lives of the commune members improved year by year. During the difficult times, Dazhai did not sell a single jin of high-priced grain but provided over 40,000 jin of grain to support the brother brigades in difficulty.

In 1963, Dazhai suffered a major flood disaster, with houses, land, and crops all severely damaged. We did not ask the state for money, grain, or relief supplies but, following Chairman Mao's teachings, relied on self-reliance and hard work to overcome the disaster and achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production. Through the practice and testing of class struggle and production struggle, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members in Dazhai was greatly improved. Starting from 1964, all commune members lived in new cave dwellings, and a thriving socialist new countryside appeared at the foot of Tiger Head Mountain. These iron facts completely shattered the slanderous rumors of the small group of capitalism-roaders within the Party against socialism and the people's commune.

The practice of class struggle over the years has made us deeply realize that the more the socialist collective economy develops, the more they fear and oppose it; the more they oppose it, the more we struggle, and the more the socialist collective economy develops.

The great proletarian cultural revolution has sounded the death knell for the small group of capitalism-roaders within the Party. On the eve of their doom, they desperately struggle, stubbornly execute the bourgeois reactionary line, and fiercely suppress the revolutionary masses and cadres who rebel, implementing white terror. They incited some uninformed masses to collect materials on revolutionary masses and cadres, directing the struggle spearhead at the revolutionary leading cadres who suffered from the "October Incident," slandering them as the "Three Families Village" of Jinzhong, attempting to kill them. For Comrade Chen Yonggui, they also did not relax, and from the beginning of the movement, they organized an "investigation team" to collect materials from various places as ammunition for attack.

In February this year, inspired by the "January Revolution" storm in Shanghai, we, together with the revolutionary factions of the province, region, and county, seized the power of the small group of capitalism-roaders within the Party and held struggle meetings, exposing and criticizing their heinous crimes of restoring capitalism and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Seizing power and holding meetings did not mean that the enemy was completely finished and would never cause trouble again. No. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The facts are exactly like this. The small group of bad elements who were driven from power are not willing to admit defeat. They spread rumors, shoot dark arrows, continue to incite the masses to fight the masses, even to the point of starting armed struggles, disrupting the unity of the revolutionary ranks, confusing the class struggle line, shifting the direction of the struggle, continuing to conspire against Dazhai, and continuing to direct the spearhead at revolutionary leading cadres, attempting to overthrow us and then return to power. This cannot but alert us seriously. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the cunning and desperate revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be politically disarmed and put in a passive position."

At this time of nationwide exposure and criticism of the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party, in conjunction with the class struggle situation in Shanxi Province, it is an extremely important political task for us to expose all their agents in Shanxi Province and thoroughly settle their accounts. In order to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must unite to beat the fallen dogs and fully engage in the great criticism. We must make the firepower of the great criticism of the biggest group of capitalism-roaders within the Party fierce, and from a political and ideological standpoint, we must criticize them down and stink them up, so that they can never rise again.

    坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    陈永贵　任井夫　王振国　张怀英
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的统帅下，全国亿万革命人民，奋起千钧棒，口诛笔伐，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开了一场声势浩大的革命大批判运动。彻底揭露和清算他们的反革命修正主义罪行，肃清他们在各方面散布的流毒，这是无产阶级文化大革命的极为重要的伟大的战略任务。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是复辟资本主义的总代表。正是他，趁国家遭受三年自然灾害的时机，配合国际上的反华逆流，掀起了一股复辟资本主义的黑风，妄图把我们伟大的社会主义祖国引上资本主义的死路。原山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，积极地贯彻和推销他的反革命修正主义黑货，在山西省大搞资本主义复辟活动，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    土地改革以后，农村向何处去，农民究竟怎样才能走上共同富裕的道路？毛主席指出：“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却反其道而行之，鼓吹发展富农经济，反对合作化。在三年困难时期，他又拚命鼓吹农业上“要退够，包括包产到户，单干”，“自由市场还是要搞下去的”，“不要怕资本主义泛滥”。他在山西省的代理人，把这些黑话奉若神明，竭力贯彻。
    山西省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，大力推行包产到户，大刮单干风，扩大自留地。他们亲自率领人马下乡“蹲点”，搞包产到户的试验，还胡说什么：“现在应该是八仙过海，各显其能。”在介休县，他们把复辟资本主义的“公田私田制”（即分地到户，私田收入归己，公田收入交公），当作“先进经验”，到处贩卖。因此，在晋中出现了寿阳县的“包产到户”，昔阳县的“包产到组”，汾阳县的单干，平遥县的“五大下放”等。他们一方面以扩大自留地来挖社会主义集体经济的墙脚，另一方面用各种办法鼓励私人自由开荒，并要县、社、队干部轮流回家种好小块地。
    与此同时，他们又广开自由市场，大力扶植投机倒把活动。更加令人不能容忍的是，原晋中地委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了减少征购任务，弄虚作假，对各县粮食产量上报数字一压再压，压至合作化以前的水平，并给各县分配了隐瞒粮食产量的数字。这样，国家征购的粮食大大减少，而大批粮食则通过私人之手，流入自由市场。在他们的怂恿包庇之下，投机倒把活动曾经十分猖獗。
    这一小撮坏家伙反对政治挂帅，大搞物质刺激、工分挂帅。在昔阳县他们推行了劳动日兑现加倍奖惩办法，就是这样的货色。
    他们肆意进行的这些复辟资本主义的活动，一时把晋中闹得乌云满天，严重地破坏了社会主义集体经济，破坏了国家的社会主义建设，破坏了工农联盟，影响了广大贫下中农的生活。
    山西省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了实现复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，他们疯狂地反对全国农业战线上的先进红旗——大寨。
    大寨，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立起来的一面红旗。大寨人在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，依靠集体力量，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，把一个穷山村，变成一个社会主义的新大寨。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。山西省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对毛泽东思想怕得要命，恨之入骨。因此，他们把大寨看作眼中钉，肉中刺，采用各种手段反对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大寨。
    一九六○年，各地闹灾荒，粮食减产，大寨在灾年获得大丰收，平均每户卖给国家余粮三千余斤。原晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对大寨的先进经验非但不宣传推广，反而造谣说大寨成绩不真实，说什么地那么不好，怎产那么多粮？于是，派人到大寨查土地、查产量、查完成国家征购任务。事实粉碎了他们的阴谋，他们又诬蔑大寨整地增加了土地，强迫陈永贵同志压低产量，非由实产每亩六百二十斤压低为五百八十斤不可，以此来打击群众建设社会主义的积极性，否定社会主义集体经济的优越性，往大寨这面红旗上抹黑。
    一九六一年，他们为反陈永贵同志，到处散布“对劳动模范都要加以怀疑”的论调，并造谣说，“大寨是陈永贵训话搞起来的”。他们把陈永贵同志对他们复辟资本主义行为的斗争，诬蔑为“骄傲自满”，“目无领导”，“闹独立王国”，“对上级态度不好”，等等。
    一九六四年十月，他们利用在农村开展社会主义教育运动的时机，对大寨狠下毒手。他们派到大寨的工作队，不折不扣地贯彻了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的形“左”实右的反动路线，硬把坚持走社会主义道路的大寨定为有严重问题的三类队，胡说什么“越是先进，问题越大”。“大寨的红旗杆上生了虫虫，不把虫挖掉，红旗不能高举”。运动一开始，他们就把斗争矛头指向广大的贫下中农和革命的基层干部。无中生有地给干部捏造一些四不清的罪名，逼着贫下中农说干部的坏话，恶毒地挑拨干部和群众的关系。对于抵制和反对他们的贫下中农，就以“现行反革命分子”，“变质分子”的罪名，加以政治迫害。
    与此同时，他们还搞了一个由省、地、县、公社和周围大队七十多人参加的“丈量队”，经过反复丈量，折腾了五十多天，结果，他们大失所望，大寨土地不但不比上报数字多，而且还少了好几亩。一九六四年的粮食进行了核实过秤，产量没有虚报一斤。统购数字，上下核实，也不差一点。铁的事实又一次粉碎了他们的阴谋。
    工作队秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，夺了大寨的党政大权，干部统统靠边站，由他们指挥一切，掌握一切，大行其资产阶级专政，大长地富反坏的威风，大灭贫下中农的志气。前后整整折腾了两个多月，好事没干，坏事不断。
    毛主席最了解我们，最关心我们，在斗争的关键时刻，他老人家在北京接见了陈永贵同志，并对大寨工作作了重要指示。毛主席还向全国发出“农业学大寨”的伟大号召。这是对我们最大的鼓舞，最亲切的关怀，最有力的支持。毛主席亲自主持制订的二十三条，宣告了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的形“左”实右反动路线的破产。这大大撑了我们的腰，壮了我们的胆。我们赶走了那个反大寨的工作队。在中央直接派人参加下，大寨党支部和广大社员群众一道进行了四清。经过一个多月的工作，证明大寨在政治、思想、组织、经济各方面都是按照毛主席和党中央的指示办事的，不愧是一面久经考验的、全国农业战线上的先进红旗。
    但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派并不甘心失败。就在开全国人民代表大会期间，他们又派人到大寨偷偷摸摸搞陈永贵同志的材料，造谣说大寨隐瞒土地，虚报产量，并把这个材料上报中央，陷害陈永贵同志。
    为了抵制大寨的政治影响，他们竭力扶植搞资本主义起家的大队和弄虚作假的修正主义苗子作样板，到处宣扬推广，捞取政治资本。
    这一小撮坏家伙还极端仇视革命干部和革命群众创造的先进经验。昔阳县四级干部参加集体生产劳动的先进事迹，是得到毛主席亲自肯定的。他们不但不坚持下去，推广开来，相反，却费尽心机加以否定，明目张胆地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。
    原山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对抵制他们复辟资本主义罪恶活动的革命干部，实行残酷的政治陷害。经过精心策划，他们于一九六四年，制造了骇人听闻的所谓“十月反革命事件”。他们不择手段地把任井夫、王振国、张怀英以及有关的几百人打成“反党集团”，有的被开除党籍、开除公职、劳动改造，有的被捕入狱，有的被围攻挨斗，连其亲属、通讯员等都不能幸免，用心之毒，令人发指。他们的这种作法，遭到了陈永贵同志的反对，因此，他们把陈永贵同志诬蔑为“反党集团”的“拐棍”，妄图把他打成“反党集团”的成员。
    树欲静而风不止。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在山西省、在晋中从来没有停止过。尽管我们遭到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反对、迫害和打击，但是，有毛主席的鼓舞和广大革命群众、革命干部的支持，为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们从来没有停止过同他们的斗争。对于走什么道路，执行什么路线，是保大寨还是反大寨，我们都是针锋相对，寸步不让。
    我们坚决抵制了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派积极鼓吹的“三自一包”的反革命修正主义货色。别处扩大“小自由”，闹下放，大寨则一心一意搞好集体生产，扩大社会主义集体经济，全体社员，人在集体，心在集体，坚决沿着毛主席所指引的社会主义大道前进。由于社会主义集体经济发展了，因而对国家的支援也越来越大，大寨卖给国家的粮食一年比一年多，社员的生活一年比一年好。在困难时期，大寨没有卖过一粒高价粮，而是拿出四万多斤粮食支援有困难的兄弟队。
    一九六三年，大寨遭到特大洪灾，房屋、土地、庄稼都受到严重损失，我们没有向国家伸手要钱、要粮、要救济物资，而是按照毛主席的教导，依靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗，战胜灾害，赢得农业生产的大丰收。通过阶级斗争和生产斗争实践的锻炼和考验，大寨广大社员的思想觉悟有了很大的提高。从一九六四年开始，全体社员都住上了新窑洞，一个欣欣向荣的社会主义新农村出现在虎头山下。这些铁的事实，彻底粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派诬蔑社会主义和人民公社的无耻谰言。
    几年来的阶级斗争实践，使我们深深体会到，社会主义集体经济越发展，他们就越害怕，越要反对；他们越反对，我们就越斗争，社会主义集体经济就越发展。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。他们在覆灭前夕，拚死挣扎，顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂镇压起来造反的革命群众和革命干部，实行白色恐怖。他们挑动一些不明真相的群众，大整革命群众和革命干部的材料，把斗争矛头仍然指向“十月事件”受害的革命领导干部身上，胡说他们是晋中的“三家村”，妄图把他们置于死地而后快。对于陈永贵同志，他们也毫不放松，运动一开始，就组织一个“调查小组”，到各地收集材料，作为攻击的炮弹。
    今年二月，在上海“一月革命”风暴的鼓舞下，我们和省、地、县的无产阶级革命派一起，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，并开了斗争大会，揭发和批判了他们复辟资本主义、反对毛泽东思想的滔天大罪。夺了权，开了会，并不等于敌人彻底完蛋了，今后再也不会出来捣乱了。不是的。毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”事实正是这样。被赶下台的一小撮坏家伙，他们不甘心失败。他们煽阴风，放暗箭，继续挑动群众斗群众，甚至挑起武斗，破坏革命队伍的团结，扰乱阶级斗争的阵线，转移斗争的大方向，继续阴谋反大寨，继续把矛头指向革命的领导干部，妄图搞垮我们，他们再重新上台。这不能不引起我们的严重警惕。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    在举国大揭露、大批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的时候，结合山西省的阶级斗争形势，把他在山西省的代理人统统揪出来，彻底清算他们的罪行，是摆在我们面前的一项极为重要的政治任务。为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，必须齐心痛打落水狗，全力投入革命的大批判。把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判的火力搞得猛猛的，从政治思想上把他们批倒、批臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
