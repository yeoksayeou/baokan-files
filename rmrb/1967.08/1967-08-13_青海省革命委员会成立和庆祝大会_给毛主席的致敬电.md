Celebration and Establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee - Telegram of Salutation to Chairman Mao

	New China News Agency, Xining, August 12 - The full text of the telegram of salutation to Chairman Mao from the celebration and establishment meeting of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is as follows:

	Dearest and Most Respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	We, the revolutionary masses of Qinghai Province, are filled with boundless excitement as we report to you, our most red sun, the heartening news: the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been established! Under the radiant guidance of your thoughts, amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary army of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province, with the "August 18th" revolutionary rebels as the core, has achieved great unity and the "three-in-one combination," seizing back the power over party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party! We have seized it all back!

	This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you!

	This is another triumphant song echoing through the clouds in the great march forward of China's Cultural Revolution!

	This is a great victory for the Cultural Revolution on the highlands of the northwest!

	The triumphant songs resound, and the red flags flutter. On this grand day of celebration, we shout, we leap, our blood boils! A thousand words, ten thousand words surge in our hearts, our emotions surge like waves, tears flow. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! As we look back on the year-long struggle of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai, our eyes are filled with tears of excitement, and our hearts are filled with boundless love for you. The Kunlun Mountains are high, but your glorious image is even higher than the Kunlun Mountains. Qinghai Lake is deep, but your great kindness is even deeper than Qinghai Lake. With the forests of Qilian as a pen and the waters of Qinghai Lake as ink, we cannot write enough of our boundless gratitude and admiration for you! We wish you, our dear leader, eternal life! Eternal life!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your mighty hand that steers the ship of China's revolution, guiding us from one victory to another!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you, with the great spirit and courage of a contemporary revolutionary, who personally initiated the Cultural Revolution, smashing the plots of domestic and foreign class enemies to restore capitalism in our country, ensuring that our socialist state remains unshakable for generations to come! It is you who personally wrote the most brilliant chapter in the history of the international communist movement, solving the theoretical and practical problems of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing and developing Marxism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

	It is you who personally presided over the drafting of the May 16th Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, sounding the bugle for the Cultural Revolution.

	It is you who personally decided to broadcast the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism nationwide, igniting the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution.

	It is you who, with great foresight and decisive measures, personally wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," declaring the bankruptcy of the headquarters of the old world and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie.

	It is you who personally presided over the drafting of the "Sixteen Points" and the documents of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, further systematically solving the theoretical, line, policy, methods, and principles of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, illuminating the path forward for the Cultural Revolution.

	The universe is vast, the wind roars, and the thunder booms. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your series of great instructions and wise decisions have inspired millions of Cultural Revolution fighters to launch a comprehensive and victorious offensive against the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Respected Chairman Mao, at your command, we charge into battle. "Overthrow the tyrant, liberate the spirits." Your great call has given us an unshakable belief in victory, inspiring us to launch continuous attacks on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, eliminating a stubborn stronghold of capitalist restoration.

	Rebellion is justified, rebel to the end. Your earnest expectations have given us boundless courage and strength, enabling us to publish an editorial titled "Great Offensive, Great Counterattack, Great Revolution" in the June 3, 1966 issue of the Qinghai Daily, determined to follow you, vowing to be the pioneers who smash the old world and the vanguard who open a new era.

	Respected Chairman Mao, you teach us: "Great winds and waves are nothing to fear. Human society develops through great winds and waves." For a year, we have faced adverse winds and fought against fierce waves, breaking through the numerous encirclements of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie.

	On December 9th in Minhe, we smashed the old Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's plot to secretly destroy a truckload of black materials, and the banner of "Rebellion is justified" flew high on both banks of the Huangshui River; on January 28th, a great seizure of power! We rode the stormy waves of the January Revolution, repelling the invasion of the bourgeois economic wind, and our revolutionary rebel red tide surged forward. It is your revolutionary line that has always guided us to victory, tempering us in the storm of struggle.

	Respected Chairman Mao, you teach us: "You must care about national affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!" You, our dear leader, toil for the fate of mankind, speaking with deep concern. We, for the future of our motherland, are bold and ambitious. Your brilliant thoughts are our invincible spiritual armor. "We can reach for the moon in the ninth heaven, and dive into the five oceans to catch turtles." We fear neither rapid currents nor dangerous shoals, nor mountains of knives and seas of fire. We have thoroughly smashed the counterrevolutionary restoration tide created by the handful of capitalist-roaders in Qinghai, using our blood and lives to defend your revolutionary line and your boundless great thoughts.

	"Only through revolution do we realize how close Beijing is; rebellion makes us feel even closer to Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the white terror of mist and fog, we gazed at your glorious image day and night; in difficult times, your teachings are deeply engraved in our hearts!

	The righteous song of the revolution shakes the heavens and the earth, and we live and die for the revolution. Facing brutal persecution, we loudly read your teachings: "Be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." In the nine days and nine nights of bravely defending the Qinghai Daily, we sang with tears of joy and deep affection: "Looking up, we see the Big Dipper, and in our hearts, we think of Mao Zedong."

	We hold high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and face east, our hearts toward the east, shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The blue sky and white clouds carry our red hearts. The rising sun illuminates the vast sky, and the rivers and mountains of our motherland display a new appearance. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who, with your profound insight, timely discovered the problems in Qinghai, corrected the course of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai, and guided us onto a new historical journey.

	The heavens and the earth are not as great as your kindness, and parents are not as dear as you! How can we not shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

	"Tigers crouch and dragons coil, today surpassing yesterday, the earth turns over and the heavens change, heroic and passionate." Most respected Chairman Mao! Under the radiant guidance of your boundless thoughts, the river of history surges more powerfully, vast and magnificent, rolling eastward, with a thousand changes. Today, the situation in Qinghai is excellent! Your revolutionary criticism flag is planted throughout the Kunlun Mountains, and the revolutionary seeds you sowed bloom on both banks of the Huangshui River. A high tide of criticizing and fighting against China's Khrushchev is rising and developing across the Qinghai Plateau.

	Revolutionary practice has made us deeply understand the truth you taught: the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The shocking reality of class struggle has made us deeply understand: power is our lifeline. To prevent capitalist restoration, we must never forget class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and fight to the death to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are determined to follow your teachings, raise high the flag of your revolutionary criticism, combine the criticism of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party with the criticism of his agents in Qinghai, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform in our units. We will resolutely complete the glorious task you have given us of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms, and fight the Cultural Revolution to the end, ensuring that our country's ironclad mountains and rivers remain unshakable for generations to come.

	Respected Chairman Mao, you support us, and we will make you proud. We have seized power from the class enemies with our blood and lives, and we will also defend this power with our blood and lives. "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." With the radiant guidance of your thoughts and the guidance of the line, policies, and principles you personally presided over, we dare to seize power for the proletariat and will certainly be good at using power for the proletariat. We will resolutely execute and defend the "three-in-one combination" policy you proposed, strengthen the great unity of the various nationalities in Qinghai, and fight to quickly establish a new order of proletarian revolution.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We deeply understand that our victory, compared to your strategic deployment, is only the first step of a ten-thousand-li journey. We will always remember your warning to be vigilant against the "sugar-coated bullets" of the enemy, follow your instruction to "be thrifty in revolution," remember your teaching to "be both an official and a common person," respond to your call to "not live on past merits but to create new achievements," be vigilant against the enemy's plot of "peaceful evolution," prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses, carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, maintain the good style of criticism and self-criticism, forever preserve the revolutionary nature of the proletariat, never change, and forever be revolutionary.

	Respected Chairman Mao, you always teach us: we must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all of mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself. We will definitely follow your words and act according to your policies, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, unite all forces that can be united, form a mighty revolutionary army, and launch a comprehensive and victorious offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader within the party. We will not only be domestic revolutionaries but also world revolutionaries, never forgetting the class brothers oppressed around the world, and be ready at any time to support the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, letting the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon the entire globe and illuminate the ages!

	Respected Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution, promote production" is your great policy, and we will definitely implement it without compromise. We will ride the east wind of the Cultural Revolution, vigorously promote agricultural, industrial, and pastoral production, and work hard to build Qinghai into a strategic rear base for our socialist motherland.

	Most respected Chairman Mao, it is you who, at the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, issued the call to the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left. This is your greatest concern and support for us. The People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits in the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai, standing shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the "August 18th" revolutionary rebels, sharing the urgencies and needs of the revolutionaries. The unity of the military and the people is unbreakable; see who can challenge us? We will forever learn from the People's Liberation Army, stand together with the People's Liberation Army, fight together with the People's Liberation Army, and win together with the People's Liberation Army. We will strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely suppress all disruptive and destructive activities of the class enemies. We vow to turn the vast Kunlun Mountains into an iron wall and the endless Qilian Mountains into an invincible line of defense.

	"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are our wise helmsman, you are our great leader, we vow to defend you, we vow to defend your revolutionary line, and defend the proletarian headquarters represented by you. We will forever remember your teachings: the current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and there will necessarily be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will only be decided over a very long historical period. If things go wrong, capitalist restoration will be possible at any time. We must be highly vigilant against those Khrushchev-like figures, be loyal to your thoughts for generations to come. Whoever dares to oppose you, we will overthrow them! Whoever dares to defame your brilliant thoughts, we will rebel against them! Whoever dares to touch a hair of the proletarian headquarters, we will smash them to pieces! To defend you, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our heads and shed our blood. The red hearts of generations will remain loyal, and the long river of our wills will never be shaken. Our loyalty to you will never change, and your great thoughts will forever shine with the sun and the moon!

	Most respected Chairman Mao, we solemnly pledge to you: we will resolutely carry out the call of Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, to be your good soldiers. We will definitely use your brilliant thoughts to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. We will regard the study of your brilliant works as the highest, the first, the greatest, and the heaviest of all. We will forever take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, work hard on transforming our worldview, thoroughly overthrow the "self," establish the absolute authority of your brilliant thoughts in our minds, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, and guide the petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the track of proletarian revolution. We will strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and vow to build Qinghai into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Let the great, boundless Mao Zedong Thought forever shine upon the Qinghai Plateau.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! A thousand words cannot express our boundless faith, loyalty, admiration, and love for you. With you, the fate of mankind has hope; with you, the future of the world has a direction; with you, we have a brilliant future! We will forever follow you, follow your brilliant thoughts, follow the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, and follow the proletarian headquarters led by you. The times are advancing! The motherland is advancing! Please rest assured, we will never disappoint your expectations! The thousand-year history will be written by us under your guidance—a song of praise for your brilliant thoughts; the ten-thousand-li rivers and mountains will be arranged by us under your instructions—a new world of your brilliant thoughts! We will forever be the new generation loyal to you!

	With the most sincere heart, we wish you, the most red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!

	Celebration and Establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee

    我们——青海省的无产阶级革命派，怀着万分激动的心情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告一个振奋人心的喜讯：青海省革命委员会成立了！在您的光辉思想照耀下，在革命的大批判的高潮中，我们青海省的无产阶级文化革命大军，以“八·一八”革命造反派为主体，实现了革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，把青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃踞的党、政、财、文大权，夺回来了！都夺回来了！
    这是以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    这是我国无产阶级文化大革命乘风破浪胜利前进的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    这是无产阶级文化大革命在西北高原的一次大捷！
    凯歌高奏，红旗漫卷，在这欢庆胜利的盛大节日里，我们欢呼，我们跳跃，我们热血沸腾！千言万语涌心头，心潮逐浪热泪流，我们一千遍，一万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！今天，当我们回顾一年来青海省无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程时，我们的眼里饱含着激动的泪水，心头充满了对您的无限热爱。昆仑山高，您光辉的形象更比昆仑山高，青海湖深，您天大的恩情更比青海湖深。以祁连森林作笔，用青海湖水当墨，也写不尽我们对您的无限感激，无限敬仰！我们永远永远祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您那掌握着中国革命航船之舵的巨手，引导我们从胜利走向新的胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您以当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄和胆略亲手发动了无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了国内外阶级敌人在我国复辟资本主义的阴谋，保证了我国社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色！是您亲手书写了国际共产主义运动史上最光辉的篇章，解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论和实践问题，把马克思主义推进和发展到了毛泽东思想的新阶段。
    是您亲自主持制定了中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角。
    是您亲自决定广播全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。
    是您高瞻远瞩，以极大的魄力，果断的措施，亲手写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，宣告了维护旧世界的资产阶级司令部和资产阶级反动路线的破产。
    是您亲自主持制定的十六条和党的八届十一中全会的文件，进一步系统地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命继续前进的道路。
    云涌星驰宇宙宽，风吼雷鸣气势豪。毛主席啊，毛主席！您一系列的伟大指示和英明决策，鼓舞着亿万文化革命大军，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动了全面的胜利的总攻击。
    敬爱的毛主席，您老人家一声令下，我们挥戈杀向战场。“打倒阎王，解放小鬼”。您伟大的号召，给了我们必胜的坚定信念，鼓舞着我们向青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起连续冲击，清除了资本主义复辟的一个顽固堡垒。
    造反有理，一反到底。您殷切的期望，给了我们无穷无尽的勇气和力量，使我们在一九六六年六月三日的《青海日报》上发表了题为《大进攻，大反击，大革命》的社论，决心紧紧跟着您老人家，誓当砸烂旧世界的闯将，永作开创新时代的先锋。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”一年来，我们迎逆风，战恶浪，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的重重围困。
    “一二·九”在民和，我们粉碎了旧青海省委妄图私自销毁一汽车黑材料的阴谋，“造反有理”的战旗在湟水两岸高高飘扬；“一·二八”大夺权！我们踏着“一月革命风暴”的狂涛怒澜顶风上，击退了资产阶级经济主义歪风的进袭，我们革命造反的红色铁流浩浩荡荡。是您的革命路线时时为我们胜利领航，使我们在斗争的暴风雨中锻炼成长。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”您老人家为人类命运操劳，语重心长，我们为祖国前途出力，志大胆壮。您光辉的思想是我们无坚不摧，无攻不克的精神武装。“可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖。”急流险滩无所惧，刀山火海我敢闯。我们彻底粉碎了青海一小撮走资本主义道路当权派制造的反革命复辟逆流，用鲜血和生命保卫了您的革命路线，保卫了您光焰无际的伟大思想。
    “革命方知北京近，造反更觉毛主席亲。”毛主席啊，毛主席！在阴云迷雾的白色恐怖中，我们日日夜夜仰望着您光辉的形象；在艰难的日子里，您老人家的教导深深铭刻在我们的心坎上！
    浩歌正气动天地，生生死死为革命。面对残酷的迫害，我们高声朗读着您的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在英勇守卫青海日报社的九天九夜里，我们满含热泪无限深情地一遍又一遍高唱：“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东。”
    我们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》面向着东方，心向着东方，高呼着：“毛主席万岁！”的口号。碧血青史写新篇，蓝天白云寄红心。
    旭日东升照长空，锦绣河山展新容。毛主席啊，毛主席！又是您老人家洞察一切，及时发现了青海的问题，拨正了青海省无产阶级文化大革命的航向，引导着我们走上了新的历史航程。
    天大地大不如您老人家的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲！我们又怎能不千遍万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”最最敬爱的毛主席！在您光焰无际的思想照耀下，历史的长河更加汹涌澎湃，波澜壮阔，浩荡东向，气象万千。今天，青海的形势大好！您的革命批判的大旗，插遍了昆仑南北，您播下的革命种子，生根开花在湟河两岸，一个万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判、大斗争的高潮，正在青海高原全面兴起，蓬勃发展。
    革命实践使我们更加深切地体会了您所教导的真理：革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切。惊心动魄的阶级斗争的现实，使我们深深懂得：政权就是我们的命根子。为了防止资本主义复辟，我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，为了保卫无产阶级专政而誓死斗争。我们决心遵循您老人家的教导，高举起您的革命批判的大旗，把对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判，同批判他在青海省党内的代理人结合起来，同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，坚决完成您交给我们的一斗、二批、三改的光荣任务，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使祖国的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    敬爱的毛主席，您给我们撑腰，我们要为您争气。我们用鲜血和生命从阶级敌人手里夺得了大权，我们也一定要用鲜血和生命来保卫这个大权。“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”有您光辉思想的照耀，有您亲自主持制定的路线、方针、政策的指引，我们敢于为无产阶级掌权，我们也一定善于为无产阶级用权。我们坚决执行和捍卫您提出的革命的“三结合”方针，加强青海各族人民的大团结，为迅速建立无产阶级革命的新秩序而斗争。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们深深地懂得，我们的胜利同您的战略部署要求比较，只是万里长征的第一步。我们一定念念不忘您的告诫，要警惕“人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”，遵照您所提出的“要节约闹革命”的指示，牢记您“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，响应您“不要吃老本，要立新功”的号召，警惕阶级敌人“和平演变”的阴谋，防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，坚持批评与自我批评的良好作风，永远永远保持无产阶级的革命本色，永不变质，永远革命。
    敬爱的毛主席，您总是谆谆教导我们：必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。我们一定听您的话，照您制定的政策办事，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击。我们不但要做国内革命派，还要做世界革命派，永远不忘国际上一切受压迫的阶级兄弟，随时准备支援亚非拉地区反帝反修的斗争，让伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照全球，闪耀万代！
    敬爱的毛主席，“抓革命，促生产”，是您提出来的伟大方针，我们一定要不折不扣地执行。我们要乘文化大革命的东风，猛促工农牧业生产，多快好省地为把青海建设成为祖国社会主义的战略后方而挥汗劳动。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，是您在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，向中国人民解放军发出了应该积极支持左派广大群众的战斗号召。这是您对我们的最大关怀，最大支持。中国人民解放军在青海的文化大革命中建立了不朽的功勋，和“八·一八”革命造反派肩并肩，心贴心，急革命派之所急，帮革命派之所需。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？我们要永远向解放军学习，和解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，大力加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压一切阶级敌人的捣乱和破坏活动。誓让莽莽昆仑变为钢铁般的长城，绵绵祁连变成无敌的防线。
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。”毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们的英明舵手，您是我们的伟大领袖，我们誓死保卫您，誓死保卫您的革命路线，保卫以您为代表的无产阶级司令部。我们永远永远牢记您的教导：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。我们要高度警惕那些赫鲁晓夫式的人物，千秋万代忠于您的思想。谁敢反对您，我们就打倒谁！谁敢诋毁您的光辉思想，我们就造他的反！谁敢动无产阶级司令部一根毫毛，我们就砸它个稀巴烂。为了保卫您，我们不惜抛头颅，洒热血。江山代代赤胆在，长河滔滔志不摧。我们忠于您的红心永不变，您伟大的思想永远永远与日月同辉！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们向您庄严宣誓：我们最最坚决地执行林彪副统帅的号召，永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我们一定要用您光辉的思想，来统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。我们要把学习您的光辉著作，看得高于一切，先于一切，大于一切，重于一切。我们要永远以“老三篇”为座右铭，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，彻底斗倒“私”字，在头脑里树立您光辉思想的绝对权威，克服各种非无产阶级思想，把小资产阶级的思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，誓把青海建设成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。让伟大的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远永远照耀着青海高原。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语说不尽我们对您的无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜，无限热爱。有了您，人类的命运就有希望；有了您，世界的前途就有指靠；有了您，我们就有光辉灿烂的未来！我们要永远紧跟着您，紧跟您的光辉思想，紧跟以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟以您为首的无产阶级司令部。时代在前进！祖国在前进！请您老人家放心吧！我们决不辜负您的期待！千年青史，在您的教导下，由我们来谱写——谱写成您光辉思想的颂歌；万里山河，在您的指示下，由我们来安排——安排成您光辉思想的新天下！我们永远永远是忠于您的新一代！
    最最衷心地祝愿您啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                          青海省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
