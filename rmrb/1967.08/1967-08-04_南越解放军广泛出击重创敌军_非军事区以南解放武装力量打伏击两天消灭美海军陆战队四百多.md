The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has launched widespread attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on enemy forces. Liberation armed forces in the area south of the demilitarized zone conducted ambushes over two days, annihilating more than 400 U.S. Marines.

Hanoi, August 4, Xinhua News Agency: On July 28 and 29, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam conducted multiple counter-sweeping battles south of the demilitarized zone, killing and wounding more than 400 U.S. Marines from the 9th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, reducing the regiment's strength by more than half.

The U.S. invading forces of this regiment came out of the Khe Sanh base for a sweep in the afternoon of the 28th but found no liberation forces. On their way back to the base, they were repeatedly attacked by guerrilla forces, suffering heavy casualties. By around 10 a.m. on the 29th, when this regiment of U.S. invading forces walked onto a narrow dirt road, they were ambushed by a unit of liberation armed forces. Liberation soldiers hidden in the bushes on both sides of the road opened fire with fierce mortar shells as soon as all the enemy troops entered the ambush circle, causing the enemy to flee in panic. According to reports, a U.S. private who narrowly escaped said, "Every time we stood up to run, they (the liberation forces) would shoot. There were tracer bullets everywhere, and we just kept running and running."

Following this, the brave liberation soldiers courageously charged into the enemy ranks, splitting the enemy regiment into several parts and annihilating the enemy in close combat. According to preliminary reports, in this ambush battle, the liberation forces killed and wounded more than 200 enemy troops.

In recent days, local forces and guerrilla units south of the demilitarized zone have continuously attacked and ambushed the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 9th, the guerrilla forces in Phong Dien County, Thua Thien Province, ambushed four enemy vehicles on Highway 1, killing 82 U.S. invading troops. On the 18th, the guerrilla forces in Phu Loc County blew up two enemy vehicles with landmines. On the 14th and 15th, local forces and guerrilla units in the northern part of Quang Tri Province continuously attacked U.S. Marine Corps units in the eastern part of Yu Ling County, killing and wounding 218 enemy troops.

Hanoi, August 3, Xinhua News Agency: According to reports from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the brave liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have launched widespread attacks on various battlefields since July, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

On July 17 and 18, the liberation armed forces in the New An-Di An region bravely attacked three enemy transport convoys on the West River, sinking seven transport ships loaded with military supplies, including M-113 and M-118 armored vehicles, and damaging five others, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy troops.

On the night of July 19 and the early morning of the 20th, the liberation armed forces in Ba Ria Province attacked the enemy's garrison in Ai Khe Commune, Thuy Dinh County, annihilating three enemy companies. At the same time, the liberation armed forces in Ba Ria Province also shelled the De Thang military support area, causing the enemy to suffer severe losses. On the night of July 2, the liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. artillery positions west of Mo Duc County. The shells accurately hit the enemy's command post and positions, killing and wounding more than 100 U.S. invading troops and destroying four cannons.

On July 3, the liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province bravely attacked an enemy convoy on Highway 1 north of Hai Van Pass, destroying 64 enemy vehicles and annihilating 250 U.S. and puppet troops.

In early July, the liberation armed forces in Ninh Thuan Province foiled a large-scale sweep by U.S. and puppet troops and South Korean mercenaries in some communes of Bo Ai County, annihilating 440 enemy troops, most of whom were U.S. invading troops and South Korean mercenaries, shooting down 19 aircraft, and damaging 27 others.

The heroic South Vietnamese Liberation Army is advancing in victory, pursuing the enemy.

    这个营的美国侵略军二十八日下午从昆天据点出来“扫荡”，但是扑了个空，连个解放军的影子也没有找到。在撤回据点的路上，却不断遭到游击队的袭击，被打死打伤了很多人。到二十九日上午十时左右，这个营的美国侵略军刚走上一条狭窄的土路，又遭到了解放武装力量一支部队的伏击。埋伏在土路两边丛莽中的解放军战士等全部敌人进入伏击圈时，就发射出猛烈的迫击炮火，吓得敌人连滚带爬仓惶逃命。据报道，一个侥幸逃命出来的美军二等兵心有余悸地说，“每当我们站起来要跑的时候，他们（解放军）就开枪。到处都是曳光弹，我们一批人就这样跑啊跑啊。”
    接着，机智英勇的解放军战士就勇猛冲入了敌阵，把这个营的敌人切成几段，在近战中消灭敌人。据初步消息，在这次伏击战中，解放军共打死打伤敌人二百多名。

    新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英勇的越南南方解放武装力量七月以来在各个战场上广泛出击，给予敌人重大的打击。
    新安—堤岸地区解放武装力量在七月十七日和十八日两天中，在西万古河上英勇袭击敌人三个运输船队，击沉满载包括M—113和M—118装甲车在内的军事物资的运输船只七艘，击伤五艘，打死打伤敌人成百名。
    巴地省解放武装力量七月十九日夜和二十日凌晨袭击州德县艾交乡的敌军驻地，全歼伪军三个连。同时，巴地省解放武装力量还炮轰德盛军事支区，使敌人遭到严重损失。广义省解放武装力量七月二日夜间猛烈炮击慕德县西面的美国炮兵阵地。炮弹准确地击中了敌人的指挥所和阵地，打死打伤美国侵略军一百多名，击毁大炮四门。
    承天省解放武装力量七月三日在海云岭北面一号公路上英勇地袭击敌人的车队，击毁敌人军车六十四辆，歼灭美伪军二百五十名。
