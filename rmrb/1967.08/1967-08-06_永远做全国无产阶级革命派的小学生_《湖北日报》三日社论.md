The proletarian cultural revolution in the Wuhan area has entered a new stage of victory. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the army, as well as the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have revealed their true colors as paper tigers. The bourgeois reactionary line has collapsed, and the "Million Heroes" are crumbling. The enemy's doom is inevitable. The revolutionary tide is surging forward, unstoppable.

The boundless, invincible thought of Mao Zedong illuminates the city of Wuhan. The warm care and support of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the warm care and support of our beloved Vice Chairman Lin, the care and support of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the support of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary forces in the capital and throughout the country are the fundamental guarantees for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Wuhan area.

"Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao." It is Chairman Mao who led us out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line's storm and bloodshed, who repelled the counter-revolutionary tide launched by the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the army in the Wuhan area, and who won the great victory of the Wuhan proletarian cultural revolution. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

The victory of the Wuhan proletarian cultural revolution is the victory of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the victory of our great leader Chairman Mao's wise policies, and the victory of the great unity of the entire army and all the proletarian revolutionary forces in the country under the great banner of Mao Zedong thought.

The Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the country have highly praised and commended the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Wuhan area for their new victories in the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the greatest encouragement and the greatest spur for us in the Wuhan area. We, the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Wuhan area, must not be complacent but must strive even harder. At present, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the army in the Wuhan area, as well as the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have not yet been thoroughly overthrown, exposed, and crushed. They are still resisting desperately and playing new tricks. To achieve a complete victory, the proletarian revolutionary forces must engage in a long, arduous, and tortuous struggle. At this critical moment, even the slightest hint of complacency will bring irreparable damage to the revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant."

The proletarian revolutionary forces in the Wuhan area should realize that our contribution to the proletarian cultural revolution throughout the country is extremely small, and we have not yet fulfilled the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We must humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces in Beijing and Shanghai, and from the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the country. We must, like them, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle; we must, like them, be brave and tenacious, forge ahead, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, give the fallen dogs a thorough beating, and carry the revolution through to the end; we must, like them, dare to struggle and be good at struggling, combining the great revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude; we must, like them, do political and ideological work patiently and enthusiastically to win over the masses who have been deceived, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; we must, like them, always put the overall situation first, achieve the broadest unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces; we must, like them, both act as the driving force of the revolution and as the object of the revolution, and while seizing power from the capitalist-roaders in the Party, seize the power of the "self" in our minds; we must, like them, dare to criticize ourselves, and always maintain a humble, prudent, and hardworking attitude. The proletarian revolutionary forces in the capital, Shanghai, and throughout the country have made outstanding contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution, created many good experiences, and set many good examples, all of which are worth our serious study. The proletarian revolutionary forces in the Wuhan area are determined to forever be students of the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the country.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must be made to continue to maintain a humble, prudent, non-arrogant, and non-impulsive attitude, and must be made to continue to maintain a hardworking attitude."

Now, in order to achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in the Wuhan area, we must engage in a tremendous struggle. Therefore, we must maintain a humble, prudent, non-arrogant, and non-impulsive attitude, arouse even greater fighting spirit, and prepare for greater battles. By taking the July 27th letter from the Central Committee to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan as our action guideline, we will redouble our efforts and strictly carry out the directives of the Central Committee. Only in this way can we successfully carry out the great criticism, thoroughly smash the various forms of counterattacks by the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the army and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line; only in this way can we quickly achieve great unity and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, successfully complete the struggle for power, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

    永远做全国无产阶级革命派的小学生
     《湖北日报》三日社论
    新华社武汉五日电　新生的《湖北日报》三日发表题为《永远做全国无产阶级革命派的小学生》的社论，全文如下：
    武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了胜利的新阶段。党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头已经现出了纸老虎的原形，资产阶级反动阵线已经分崩离析，“百万雄师”正在土崩瓦解。阶级敌人彻底灭亡的大势已定。革命潮流滚滚向前，势不可挡。
    光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想照耀着江城。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和支持，我们敬爱的林副主席的亲切关怀和支持，党中央、中央军委、中央文革的关怀和支持，伟大的中国人民解放军和首都的、全国的无产阶级革命派的支持，是武汉地区的无产阶级革命派能够取得今天的胜利的最根本保证。
      “爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。是毛主席带领我们从资产阶级反动路线的腥风血雨的白色恐怖中冲杀出来，击退了武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掀起的反革命逆流，赢得了武汉无产阶级文化大革命的巨大胜利。我们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    武汉无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明政策的胜利，是人民解放军全军指战员和全国无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下大团结的胜利。
    党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组和全国的无产阶级革命派在祝贺武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利中，对武汉地区无产阶级革命派给予了很高的评价和赞扬。这是对我们武汉地区无产阶级革命派的最大鼓舞，同时也是对我们的最大鞭策。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派绝不能因此而骄傲起来，而应该更加努力奋斗。目前，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，还没有被我们彻底斗倒、斗臭、斗垮，他们还在负隅顽抗，耍弄新的花招。无产阶级革命派要取得彻底胜利，还要进行艰苦、曲折、长期的斗争。在这个关键时刻，一丝一毫的骄傲自满情绪，都会给革命事业带来不可挽回的损失。
    毛主席教导我们：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”
    我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派应该看到，我们对全国的无产阶级文化大革命的贡献是极其微小的，我们还没有完成毛主席、党中央赋予我们的伟大的历史使命。我们必须虚心地向北京、上海的无产阶级革命派学习，向全国的无产阶级革命派学习。要象他们那样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向；要象他们那样英勇顽强，一往无前，高举革命批判大旗，痛打落水狗，把革命进行到底；要象他们那样既敢于斗争，又善于斗争，把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来；要象他们那样热情地耐心地对受蒙蔽的群众做政治思想工作，争取他们尽快地回到毛主席的革命路线上来；要象他们那样处处以大局为重，实现最广泛的无产阶级革命派的大团结；要象他们那样，既把自己作为革命的动力，又把自己作为革命的对象，在勇夺党内走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，狠夺自己头脑中“私”字的权；要象他们那样，勇于自我批评，永远保持谦虚、谨慎、艰苦奋斗的作风。首都、上海和全国的无产阶级革命派为无产阶级文化大革命作出了杰出的贡献，创造了许多好经验，树立了许多好样板，都是值得我们认真学习的。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派决心永远做全国无产阶级革命派的小学生。
    毛主席教导我们说：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    现在，我们无产阶级革命派要夺取武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，还须进行艰巨的斗争。因此，我们更要保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，激励起更旺盛的斗志，准备进行更大的战斗。以中央七月二十七日给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的信作为行动纲领，百倍努力，不折不扣地执行中央的指示。这样，才能胜利地进行革命的大批判，彻底粉碎党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头各种形式的反扑；才能迅速实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，胜利完成夺权斗争，胜利完成斗批改任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
