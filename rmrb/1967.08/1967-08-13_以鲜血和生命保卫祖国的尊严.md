The great internationalist, Chinese Red Aid Worker Liu Yi, died heroically in the struggle against the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma. He wrote a magnificent poem of Mao Zedong Thought with his blood and life.

Facing the black storm of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment from the Burmese reactionaries and the knives and axes of fascist thugs, Liu Yi stood up bravely, took the lead, and fought a heart-stopping battle with the enemy barehanded. To defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and the dignity of the socialist motherland, our brave Red Aid Workers spilled their blood and sacrificed their lives on Burmese soil.

The young Liu Yi was fearless of sacrifice and unafraid of violence. In the face of beasts, he showed no trace of cowardice, fully demonstrating that "the Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with its enemies." He is indeed a good son of the great motherland and a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Liu Yi was nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He harbored deep hatred for imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and had boundless sympathy for the oppressed peoples and nations. With profound class feelings, he served the Burmese working people. During his time in Burma, he endured hardships, worked diligently, took on the heaviest burdens, went where the difficulties were, and shared the joys and sorrows of the people. He breathed with them, fully embodying the high moral character of "selflessness and dedication to others" and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Liu Yi propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought with his actions, set an example for Chinese aid workers, and added luster to the friendship between the socialist motherland and the peoples of China and Burma.

The aid workers of socialist China are revolutionary warriors of the proletariat. They follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, take the world revolution as their mission, regard the revolutionary cause of the peoples of all countries as their own, and dedicate everything to the complete victory of this cause.

The aid workers of socialist China are ordinary laborers. They work and labor with the proletarian brothers of all countries, maintaining a hardworking, brave, and honest style, taking their work extremely seriously, and being extremely enthusiastic about the people. They wholeheartedly serve the working people of all countries.

The aid workers of socialist China are enthusiastic propagandists and brave defenders of Mao Zedong Thought. They spread Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go, making it take root, bloom, and bear fruit all over the world.

Chinese aid workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are firm in their proletarian stance and clear in their hatreds and loves in the international class struggle. They can always distinguish between right and wrong, friends and enemies, uphold truth and principles, dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, is the most reliable guarantee for them to complete their sacred mission.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle means to make sacrifices. The death of comrades is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai."

In the current situation where the international class struggle is becoming increasingly fierce, it is inevitable that there will be sacrifices in supporting the revolutionary cause of the peoples of all countries. The green mountains are everywhere for the burial of loyal bones. Chinese aid workers who are infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, to the socialist motherland, and to proletarian internationalism, are ready to sacrifice everything for themselves at any time to defend the revolutionary interests of the peoples of all countries.

Although the Burmese reactionaries killed Liu Yi, they cannot harm the glorious image of the hero Liu Yi. The blood of the martyr flows on the soil of Burma, and the image of the hero lives in the hearts of the broad masses of the Burmese people and the revolutionary people of the world. The blood of the martyr will not be shed in vain. The blood of the martyr will make the flower of Sino-Burmese friendship bloom even more luxuriantly. The blood of the martyr will help the Burmese people see more clearly the ferocious face and weak essence of the Ne Win reactionary government. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people will develop more rapidly and shake the shaky reactionary rule of the Ne Win clique more strongly.

The martyrs who sacrificed themselves to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, the dignity of the great motherland, and the brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Burma will be immortal!

    以鲜血和生命保卫祖国的尊严
    本报评论员
    伟大的国际主义者、中国红色援外战士刘逸同志，在反抗缅甸奈温反动政府法西斯暴行的斗争中，英勇地牺牲了。他用自己的鲜血和生命，写下了伟大的毛泽东思想的壮丽诗篇。
    面对着缅甸反动派反华排华的黑风恶浪，面对着法西斯暴徒杀人行凶的匕首斧头，刘逸同志挺身而出，奋勇当先，赤手空拳同敌人展开惊心动魄的搏斗。为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，捍卫社会主义祖国的尊严，我们勇敢的红色援外战士，在缅甸的土地上，洒下了鲜血，付出了生命。
    年轻的刘逸同志，不怕牺牲，不畏强暴，在野兽面前，没有丝毫的怯懦，充分表现了“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”。他不愧为伟大祖国的好儿女，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    刘逸同志是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼成长起来的无产阶级革命战士。他对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派无比仇恨，对被压迫人民和被压迫民族无限同情。他以极其深厚的阶级感情为缅甸劳动人民服务。在缅甸工作期间，他不怕艰苦，辛勤劳动，担子拣重的挑，哪里困难往哪里去，与人民群众同甘共苦，呼吸相通，处处表现了“毫不利己专门利人”的高尚品质和无产阶级国际主义的精神。刘逸同志以实际行动宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想，为我国援外人员树立了榜样，为社会主义祖国、为中缅两国人民的友谊增添了光辉。
    社会主义中国的援外人员，是无产阶级的革命战士。他们遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以世界革命为己任，把各国人民的革命事业看成是自己的事业，并为这一事业的彻底胜利贡献出自己的一切。
    社会主义中国的援外人员，是普通的劳动者。他们同各国的无产阶级兄弟一起工作，一起劳动，保持着艰苦朴素、诚实谦逊、勤劳勇敢的作风，对工作极端负责任，对人民极端热忱，全心全意地为各国劳动人民服务。
    社会主义中国的援外人员，是毛泽东思想的热情的宣传员和勇敢的捍卫者。他们走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里，让毛泽东思想在全世界生根，开花，结果。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国援外战士，在国际阶级斗争中，无产阶级的立场坚定，爱憎分明。他们无论在何时何地，都能辨明方向，分清敌友，坚持真理，坚持原则，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，是他们完成自己的神圣任务的最可靠的保证。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    在目前国际阶级斗争日趋激烈的情况下，要支援各国人民的革命事业，就不可避免地会有牺牲。青山处处埋忠骨。无限忠于毛泽东思想、忠于社会主义祖国、忠于无产阶级国际主义的中国援外战士，为了支援各国人民的革命事业，不惜牺牲个人的一切，随时准备拿自己的鲜血和生命去捍卫各国人民的革命利益。
    尽管缅甸反动派杀害了刘逸同志，但是他们损害不了刘逸同志的光辉的英雄形象。烈士的鲜血流在缅甸的土地上，英雄的形象活在缅甸广大人民和世界革命人民的心中，烈士的鲜血是不会白流的。烈士的鲜血将把中缅人民友谊之花浇灌得更加茂盛。烈士的鲜血，有助于缅甸人民更加看清奈温反动政府的狰狞嘴脸和虚弱的本质。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在缅甸共产党的正确领导下，缅甸人民的革命斗争将更加迅猛的发展，更加强烈地震撼着奈温集团摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    为捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想、捍卫伟大祖国的尊严、捍卫中缅两国人民的兄弟友谊而牺牲的烈士，永垂不朽！
