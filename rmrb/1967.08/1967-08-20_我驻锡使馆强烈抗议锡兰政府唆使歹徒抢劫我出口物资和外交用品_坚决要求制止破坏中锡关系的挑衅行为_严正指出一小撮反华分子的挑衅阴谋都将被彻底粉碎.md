The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka strongly protests the Sri Lankan government's incitement of thugs to rob Chinese export goods and diplomatic items. It firmly demands the cessation of provocative actions that damage Sino-Sri Lankan relations. It sternly points out that the provocative plots of a small clique of anti-China elements will be thoroughly smashed.

NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka sent a note to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on August 15, strongly protesting the Sri Lankan government's incitement of thugs to publicly rob goods from a Chinese-chartered ship docked at the Colombo port and diplomatic items from the Chinese Embassy. They brazenly tore up the works, quotations, and portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

The note said that the Chinese-chartered ship "Ioannis" was dispatched by the Chinese chartering company, carrying goods exported by China to Sri Lanka and diplomatic items for the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, arriving at the Colombo port in Sri Lanka on August 2. During the unloading period from August 3 to 5, numerous thugs continuously looted Chinese export goods and diplomatic items from the Chinese Embassy on the ship, and the situation was extremely serious. The captain requested the Colombo port police to provide protection. After the police boarded the ship, the thugs not only did not stop looting but became even more rampant. The most serious thing was that the thugs tore up a large number of works, quotations, and portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.

The note emphasized: "Such looting and destructive behavior is obviously carried out with the connivance and incitement of the Sri Lankan government. This is a serious provocation against the Chinese people and is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people."

The note said that to promote trade between China and Sri Lanka, China dispatched a chartered ship to deliver export goods to Sri Lanka according to the agreement. The Sri Lankan government and port authorities not only did not take security measures but also connived at the thugs' looting. This blatant looting is a rare and serious incident in the history of Sino-Sri Lankan trade and international trade. Under these circumstances, Sino-Sri Lankan trade cannot be guaranteed to proceed normally. The Sri Lankan government must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

The note pointed out that this incident is not accidental. In the past two years, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs, despite the Chinese Embassy's repeated protests, has seriously violated international conventions and rudely infringed upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy, instructing Sri Lankan customs officials to repeatedly forcibly inspect diplomatic items from the Chinese Embassy. Recently, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs has even brazenly detained badges of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, for more than a month. This is a serious political provocation against the Chinese people. The Sri Lankan customs have also openly confiscated and destroyed books and magazines sent from China. This serious political incident of looting is a continuation and development of the Sri Lankan government's repeated connivance of anti-China activities.

The note sternly pointed out: "The Chinese Embassy warns a small clique of anti-China elements within the Sri Lankan government: 700 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. All plots and tricks to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Sri Lanka and to carry out anti-China provocations will be met with a head-on blow from the Chinese people and will be thoroughly smashed."

The note firmly demands that the Sri Lankan government immediately take effective measures to stop the above-mentioned serious provocative actions that damage Sino-Sri Lankan relations and trade, immediately stop all extremely bad practices that violate international relations norms and discriminate against the Chinese Embassy, severely punish the criminals and instigators of the robbery of Chinese-chartered ship goods, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

    我驻锡使馆强烈抗议锡兰政府唆使歹徒抢劫我出口物资和外交用品
    坚决要求制止破坏中锡关系的挑衅行为
    严正指出一小撮反华分子的挑衅阴谋都将被彻底粉碎
    新华社科伦坡十九日电　中国驻锡兰大使馆十五日照会锡兰国防外交部，对锡兰政府唆使歹徒，公开抢劫停泊在科伦坡港口的中国租船上的出口物资和中国大使馆的外交用品，悍然撕毁中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的著作、语录和像片，提出强烈抗议。
    照会说，中国租船公司派遣租船“约安尼斯”号装载中国向锡兰出口的商品及运给中国驻锡兰大使馆的外交物品，八月二日抵达锡兰科伦坡港口。在八月三日至五日的卸货期间，为数众多的歹徒连续在船上公开抢劫中国出口商品和中国大使馆的外交物品，情况极端严重。船长要求科伦坡港口警察当局加以保护。警察局派警察上船后，歹徒非但没有停止抢劫，反而更加猖獗。尤其严重的是，歹徒竟大量撕毁中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的著作、语录和像片。
    照会强调指出：“这种抢劫和破坏行为显然是在锡兰政府纵容和唆使下进行的。这是对中国人民的严重挑衅，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。”
    照会说，为促进中国与锡兰之间的贸易，中国派遣租船按协议把出口货物运来锡兰。锡兰政府及港口当局不仅没有采取保安措施，反而纵容歹徒进行抢劫。这种明目张胆的抢劫，是中锡贸易史上和国际贸易史上罕见的严重事件。在这种情况下，中锡贸易将无法保证正常进行。锡兰政府必须承担由此产生的一切后果。
    照会指出，这次事件决不是偶然的。最近两年多以来，锡兰国防外交部不顾中国大使馆多次交涉，严重破坏国际惯例，粗暴侵犯中国大使馆外交特权，指使锡兰海关当局一再强行检查中国大使馆外交物品。最近锡兰国防外交部竟悍然扣压中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像章，迄今已达一个多月。这是对中国人民的严重的政治挑衅。锡兰海关还公然没收和销毁中国寄来的书刊。这次抢劫的严重政治事件，是锡兰政府一再纵容反华活动的继续和发展。
    照会严正指出：“中国大使馆警告锡兰政府内一小撮反华分子：七亿中国人民不是好惹的。一切企图破坏中锡两国人民的友谊和进行反华挑衅的阴谋诡计必将遭到中国人民的迎头痛击，并被彻底粉碎。”
    照会坚决要求锡兰政府立即采取有效措施，制止上述严重破坏中锡关系，破坏中锡贸易的严重挑衅行为，立即停止各种破坏国际关系准则，歧视中国大使馆的极端恶劣作法，严惩抢劫中国租船物资的罪犯和主使者，并保证今后不发生类似事件。
