Wuhan's military and civilians are seriously studying and resolutely implementing the latest instructions from the Central Committee.

	Mao Zedong is supporting us, and we must strive to make Mao Zedong proud.
	Wuhan's military and civilians are seriously studying and resolutely implementing the Central Committee's latest instructions.
	Revolutionaries are determined to unite against the enemy, thoroughly defeating, overthrowing, and exposing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region.
	Some deceived masses in the "Million Heroes" have seen the direction after reading the Central Committee's letter and are determined to follow Chairman Mao in the revolution.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 2nd: The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and broad ranks of soldiers in the Wuhan region are seriously studying, widely propagating, and resolutely implementing the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan. They said that this letter deeply analyzes the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region and clearly points out the direction and tasks of future struggles. This is the action guideline for the proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan region and a new battle call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us. They said, Chairman Mao is supporting the proletarian revolutionaries, and we proletarian revolutionaries must strive to make Chairman Mao proud. We are determined to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, unite as one, and fight together against the enemy. We will thoroughly defeat, overthrow, and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, and we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	Revolutionary organizations such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance" have held meetings, parades, and discussions in recent days to celebrate and study the letter from the Party Central Committee. Proletarian revolutionary fighters listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. While studying the Party Central Committee's instructions, they reflect on their own actions and are determined to follow them to the letter. The Wuhan Machine Tool Factory originally had two revolutionary mass organizations that had fought side by side and shared hardships. Due to some minor disagreements, they did not unite. This time, they deeply studied the Party Central Committee's letter and unanimously recognized that the two organizations must unite and combine forces to have greater strength to defeat the class enemy. Therefore, they further studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, broke down personal interests, and understood each other, putting revolutionary interests first, and together established the "Steel General New Wuhan Machine Tool Joint Command Department" to enter the new battle with a new attitude.

	Some deceived masses in the "Million Heroes" said excitedly after reading the Party Central Committee's letter: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your letter has shown us the way and the path. We are determined to leave the pit of fire, return to the right path, and return to your side, following you forever in the revolution. A worker from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory who was deceived said, "I started working for the landlord at the age of eight or nine. It was Chairman Mao who liberated me. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of capitalist roaders in power led me astray. I hate them; they are our enemies. I will definitely respond to the Party Central Committee's call, thoroughly expose the crimes of this small handful of bad people, surrender to the truth, learn from the proletarian revolutionaries, and resolutely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Many factory revolutionaries pay great attention to educating the deceived masses according to the instructions in the Central Committee's letter, striving to quickly bring them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said, only by acting according to the spirit of the Central Committee's letter can we unite all those who can be united and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	To quickly spread the voice of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Hubei Province, the Wuhan Air Force leadership sent planes to deliver the good news to various parts of the province and distributed the letter to the vast rural areas and towns. After receiving the letter distributed by the planes, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Huangshi City sang enthusiastically, "The party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth, and parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao." Nearly 40,000 proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and local left-supporting military personnel held a grand meeting. They expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, maintain high vigilance at all times, and resolutely smash the various plots of the small handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the military in their death throes. After receiving the letter distributed by the planes, the proletarian revolutionaries in Yichang City quickly wrote big-character posters and large banners and pasted them on the streets. They also held a grand parade with the liberating army soldiers who stood firmly with them, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	The broad ranks of soldiers in the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, who stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionaries, unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee, to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to firmly support and defend the leftists, and to fight and win together with them. Many soldiers said excitedly while studying this letter: Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionaries and liberating army soldiers have hearts connected, and our hearts are forever with Chairman Mao. No matter how many difficulties there are, no matter how complex the struggle is, we will definitely support the true revolutionary leftists clearly and unambiguously, be their strong backing, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with our blood and lives. We must unite with the proletarian revolutionaries with one heart and one mind, twist into one rope, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气
    武汉军民认真学习坚决执行中央最新指示
    革命派决心团结对敌，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其武汉地区代理人彻底斗垮斗倒斗臭
    “百万雄师”中一些受蒙蔽群众读了中央的信以后，看清了方向，决心紧紧跟着毛主席干革命
    新华社武汉二日电　武汉地区的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和广大指战员正在认真学习、广泛宣传和坚决贯彻中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信，他们表示，中央这封信深刻地分析了武汉地区当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势，明确地指出了今后斗争的方向和任务。这是武汉地区无产阶级革命派的行动纲领，是毛主席和党中央向我们发出的新的战斗号召。他们说，毛主席为无产阶级革命派撑腰，我们无产阶级革命派一定要为毛主席争气。我们决心紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，团结一致，共同对敌，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，彻底斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等许多革命组织，连日来都举行了集会游行和座谈讨论，欢呼和学习党中央的来信。无产阶级革命派战士，最听毛主席的话，一边学习党中央的指示，一边对照自己的行动，决心句句执行，句句照办。武汉市机床厂原来有两个曾经并肩战斗、患难与共的革命群众组织，由于在一些枝节问题上有分歧，没有联合起来。这次，他们深入学习党中央的来信，一致认识到，两个组织只有团结起来，联合起来，才有更大的力量战胜阶级敌人。于是，他们进一步活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，相互谅解，以革命利益为重，一起成立了“钢工总新武机联合指挥部”，以崭新的姿态投入了新的战斗。
    “百万雄师”中一些受蒙蔽的群众，读了党中央的信后激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！您的信给我们指明了方向，指明了道路。我们决心离开火坑，回到正路，回到您的身边，紧紧地跟着您永远干革命。武汉重型机床厂一个受蒙蔽的工人说，我八九岁给地主干活，是毛主席把我解放了。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，是一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把我引上了邪路。我恨他们，他们是我们的敌人。我一定响应党中央的号召，彻底揭露这一小撮坏人的罪恶，向真理投降，向无产阶级革命派学习，坚决回到毛主席革命路线上来。许多工厂的革命派非常重视按照中央的信的指示，努力向受蒙蔽的群众作启发教育工作，争取他们迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们说，只有按照中央的信的精神办事，才能团结一切可以团结的人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    为了把党中央、毛主席的声音最迅速地传到湖北省广大工农兵群众中去，武汉空军领导机关派出了飞机，把中央喜讯送到全省各地，把信散发到广大农村和城镇。黄石市的无产阶级革命派和革命群众接到飞机散发的党中央的来信后，激动地纵情高唱“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”无产阶级革命派、革命群众和当地支左驻军指战员近四万人，还一起隆重举行集会。他们表示决心响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，时刻保持高度的警惕，坚决粉碎党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派垂死挣扎的各种阴谋。宜昌市的无产阶级革命派接到飞机散发的信后，纷纷写大字报和大幅标语，到街头张贴。他们还和紧紧同他们站在一起的解放军指战员一同举行了盛大游行，热烈欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    紧紧和无产阶级革命派站在一起的中国人民解放军驻武汉部队广大指战员一致表示，决心响应党中央的伟大号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持和保卫左派，同他们战斗在一起、胜利在一起。许多指战员在学习这封信时，都激动地说：毛主席和无产阶级革命派、解放军指战员心连心，我们的心永远向着毛主席。困难再多，斗争再复杂，我们也一定做到旗帜鲜明地、毫不含糊地支持真正的革命左派，誓作革命左派的坚强后盾，用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席的革命路线。我们就是要和无产阶级革命派团结一条心，拧成一股绳，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
