Learn from the revolutionary leftists, and treat the revolutionary leftists as our teachers. Learning from the people, learning from the working class, and learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, is the consistent teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao, and is a glorious tradition of our army.

Comrade Lin Biao recently instructed us that the education on the two-line struggle in the army should invite the local leftists to be the teachers, and we should make use of this favorable situation. Firmly carrying out Comrade Lin Biao's extremely important instruction will have great significance in enhancing the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad cadres and fighters of the army, further strengthening military-civilian unity, and better completing the glorious tasks of "supporting the left," "military control," and "military support."

"Learning from the revolutionary leftists and treating the revolutionary leftists as our teachers" has become a unanimous action of the broad cadres and fighters of our army. A certain unit of the Wuhan Air Force has adopted the method of "inviting them in and going out to learn," and this is a good way to make use of the favorable situation.

The broad revolutionary leftists have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the struggle, they have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and have practical experience with Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have a deep understanding of the struggle between the two lines and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Learning from the revolutionary leftists can help us better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deepen our love for Chairman Mao, deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raise our level of policy and struggle.

The broad revolutionary leftists are the vanguard in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the revolutionary pioneers in exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They have suffered cruel persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line and have waged a long and arduous struggle against it. With great revolutionary daring, they have broken through the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrown the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and established immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Learning from the revolutionary leftists, listening to their indignant accusations, merciless exposures, and profound criticisms, can greatly arouse our boundless hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and for the bourgeois reactionary line, enhance our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, raise our proletarian consciousness, and strengthen our proletarian stand.

Everywhere we go, we must rely closely on the leftists and humbly consult with them, which will greatly help us in the complex class struggle to familiarize ourselves with the situation, distinguish between friends and enemies, discover problems, and find solutions, so that we can continuously improve our work of supporting the left.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can we truly learn it." To carry out education on the struggle between the two lines, we must engage in the sharp and complex class struggle, take Chairman Mao's works as our textbooks, and take the revolutionary leftists as our teachers, only then can we achieve immediate results. If we detach ourselves from reality and shut the door to do it, it will definitely not work.

At present, the broad cadres and fighters on the front lines of "supporting the left," "military control," and "military support" are united with the broad revolutionary leftists under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, holding high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," fighting together. This is a very favorable condition for carrying out the education on the struggle between the two lines in the army and strengthening the thought reform of the army. We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, with the spirit of being willing to be small students, enthusiastically learn from the revolutionary leftists, and carry out the education on the struggle between the two lines in a solid manner, and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    拜革命左派为师
    向人民群众学习，向工人阶级、向贫下中农学习，是伟大领袖毛主席对我们一贯的教导，是我军的光荣传统。
    林彪副主席最近指示我们，部队两条路线斗争的教育，应该请地方左派来当教员，要借这个东风。坚决贯彻执行林彪副主席这个极其重要的指示，对于增强部队广大指战员两条路线斗争的观念，进一步加强军民团结，更好地完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，有着重大的意义。
      “向革命左派学习，拜革命左派为师”，已经成为我军广大指战员的一致行动。武汉空军某部采取“请进来，走出去”的方式，向革命左派学习，这个东风借得好。
    广大革命左派，在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，他们对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。他们在斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，对毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，有很实际的体会，对两条路线的斗争，对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，有深刻的理解。向革命左派学习，可以促进我们更好地活学活用毛主席著作，加深我们对毛主席的热爱，加深我们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的认识，提高我们的政策水平和斗争水平。
    广大革命左派，是捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的先锋，是揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命闯将。他们受过资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害，和资产阶级反动路线作过艰苦曲折的斗争。他们以大无畏的革命造反精神，从资产阶级反动路线压制下冲杀出来，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打翻在地，为无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。向革命左派学习，听他们愤怒的控诉，无情的揭露，深刻的批判，可以大大激发我们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的无比仇恨，对资产阶级反动路线的无比仇恨，增强两条路线斗争观念，提高我们的无产阶级觉悟，坚定我们的无产阶级立场。
    我们每到一地，紧紧地依靠左派，虚心地请教左派，将大大帮助我们在复杂的阶级斗争中熟悉情况，区分敌我，发现问题，找出办法，使我们不断地改进支左工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”进行两条路线斗争的教育，必须投身到尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中去，以毛主席著作为教材，以革命左派为老师，才能够取得立竿见影的效果。如果脱离实际，关起门来搞，是一定搞不好的。
    当前，广大指战员在“三支”“两军”第一线，同广大革命左派在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，团结在一起，战斗在一起。这对搞好部队两条路线斗争教育，加强部队思想革命化，是一个十分有利的条件。我们一定要响应林彪副主席的号召，以甘当小学生的精神，满腔热情地向革命左派学习，把两条路线斗争的教育切实搞好，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功。
                                         （八月二十五日）
