Our company guards a frontline outpost in the South China Sea, where class struggle is extremely complex and sharp. Over the past decade, we have united with the island's people to not only defeat the enemy's real gunfire attacks but also to overcome the enemy's sugar-coated bullets. We have completed the glorious mission of defending the nation, assigned to us by the Party and the people, and have been honored with the title "South China Sea Frontline Steel Eighth Company."

How do we make the steel purer with each refining? The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating our path forward and the most fundamental and crucial lifeline that makes us tempered steel.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Never forget class struggle." We treat class education as our company's heirloom. Whenever old soldiers retire and new recruits arrive, the first thing we do is lead the troops to the frontline trenches, facing the decadent capitalist world just across the water. We study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and conduct comparative education on the two social systems. This helps new soldiers distinguish between friends and enemies and reminds old soldiers to never forget class struggle. We also, based on the changes in the domestic and international class struggle situation, and using the negative examples provided by the decadent capitalist world across the water and the actual cases of class struggle on the island, frequently study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. This raises our awareness, clarifies our direction, and strengthens our stance, enabling us to resolutely fight against both armed and unarmed enemies.

This spring, while patrolling the beach, we discovered a flag of the Kuomintang, a symbol of their heinous crimes. We immediately seized this negative example and convened a mass rally of military and civilian personnel from the entire island for denunciation and criticism. We studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. We must never relax our vigilance." We denounced the Kuomintang reactionaries' heinous crimes and criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, as well as the ghosts and monsters in society. This significantly raised the class consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the troops and the masses. Soldier Mo Jinyu indignantly said, "In the old society, the Kuomintang reactionaries made our lives miserable and our families broken. Today, they are colluding with a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society, attempting to make a comeback. This is a pipe dream! It's impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible!" Everyone clenched their fists, vowing together: We must always remember the bitterness of class struggle and national hatred, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness. As long as imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries exist in the world, we will forever hold our guns and guard our national defense.

Through class struggle education, comrades deeply feel: The complex and sharp class struggle environment is the best furnace for tempering red hearts. The more we roll around in it and sweat, the less bourgeois ideology we have in our minds, the more Mao Zedong Thought we have, and the purer the steel becomes.

    “钢”越炼越纯
    “南海前哨钢八连”指导员　李海文
    我们连守卫在阶级斗争极为复杂尖锐的南海前哨某岛上。十多年来，我们和岛上人民团结在一起，不仅战胜了敌人真枪实弹的进攻，还战胜了敌人糖衣炮弹的袭击，完成了党和人民交给我们的保卫国防的光荣任务，荣获“南海前哨钢八连”的光荣称号。
    怎样使“钢”越炼越纯？光焰无际的毛泽东思想是照亮我们前进道路的灯塔，是使我们百炼成钢的最根本、最紧要的命根子。
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。我们就把阶级教育作为连队的传家宝。每逢老兵退伍，新兵上岛，第一件事就是把队伍带到前沿阵地，面对一水之隔的资本主义腐朽世界，学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，进行两个社会制度对比的教育，让新战士分清敌我，让老战士永远不忘阶级斗争。我们还根据国内外阶级斗争形势的发展变化，根据对面资本主义腐朽世界提供的反面教材和岛上阶级斗争的活事例，经常学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，提高觉悟，明辨方向，站稳立场，坚决地跟拿枪的和不拿枪的敌人作斗争。
    今年春天，我们在海边巡逻时，发现一面罪恶昭彰的国民党狗牙旗，便立即抓住这个反面教材，召开全岛军民控诉批判大会。学习毛主席关于“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”的教导，控诉国民党反动派的滔天罪行，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派散布的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大大提高了部队和群众的阶级觉悟和革命警惕性。战士莫金玉愤慨地说：“在旧社会，国民党反动派害得我们人不象人，家不成家。今天，他们又和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神相呼应，企图卷土重来，这是白日做梦！一千个办不到！一万个办不到！”大家摩拳擦掌，发出共同誓言：一定牢记阶级苦，民族恨，提高警惕，加强战备，只要世界上还有帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派存在，我们就永远握紧手中枪，守卫好国防。
    通过阶级斗争教育，同志们深有体会地说：复杂尖锐的阶级斗争环境，是冶炼红心最好的熔炉。在这里多打一个滚，多出一身汗，我们头脑里的资产阶级思想就少一分，毛泽东思想就多一分，“钢”就纯一分。
