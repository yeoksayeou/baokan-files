	"We sincerely congratulate the fraternal People's Liberation Army of China on its various great victories and, at the same time, learn from the patriotism, unconditional service to the people, heroic fighting, and internationalism of the People's Liberation Army of China.

	"On this occasion, we express our heartfelt thanks to the People's Liberation Army of China and the Chinese people for their support of the Lao military and people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation! We wish the People's Liberation Army of China ever greater strength and greater victories in participating in socialist construction, resisting U.S. imperialist provocations, and liberating Taiwan!
