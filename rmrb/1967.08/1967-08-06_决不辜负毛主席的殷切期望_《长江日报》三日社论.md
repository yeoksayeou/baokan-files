    "The sails stir, the turtle and snake are still, a grand plan is being drawn."
    A new Wuhan of the proletarian revolutionaries is about to be born on the central plains, as the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region are thrown into the dustbin of history!

    "Long live the great unity of the Wuhan proletarian revolutionaries!"
    The *People's Daily* has conveyed the voice of Chairman Mao, the voice of the Party Central Committee. This is the heartfelt expectation of Chairman Mao for the Wuhan proletarian revolutionaries, and at the same time, it is a new test for the Wuhan proletarian revolutionaries.

    Can we firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, correctly handle contradictions among the people, and achieve great unity among the revolutionary ranks? This is the touchstone to test whether one is a genuine proletarian revolutionary or a petty-bourgeois revolutionary.

    Genuine proletarian revolutionaries have the broadest minds and the farthest vision.

    Genuine proletarian revolutionaries are filled with class hatred towards the enemy, fighting bravely without fear of sacrifice; they are daring fighters. Towards comrades, they are filled with class love, having different opinions is nothing strange, resolving issues through consultation; they are models of considering the bigger picture and the overall situation.

    Every genuine proletarian revolutionary must learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people, unite all forces that can be united, and concentrate on striking the main enemy.

    Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent features that distinguish us from other parties." Windbaggery, cliquism, and splittism are the vile habits of the decaying bourgeoisie, and they are corrosive agents that hinder revolutionary unity. Proletarian revolutionaries are the most upright and honest communists. They do not seek fame or personal gain; everything is for the liberation of all humanity. They are heroes who smash the old world and pioneers who break private interests and establish public interests. Because they know that overthrowing the "self" in one's mind is the need of the communist cause.

    Those who have hope are those who know how to think, not those who create factions or seek attention.

    Proletarian revolutionaries, unite! This is the need of class struggle, the need of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region. The handful of bourgeois representatives within the Party and the army and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" have been exposed in broad daylight, but they are still alive, and their spirits are not dead. They are still playing tricks, sowing discord, and trying to create splits among the proletarian revolutionaries to achieve their goals. We must not do what the enemy needs!

    Proletarian revolutionaries, unite! This is the call of the masses. We should not forget the hard road we have traveled together, nor forget the deep friendship we have forged in battle. We should always be united, coalescing into an even stronger and more powerful fist, striking hard at the common class enemy.

    Proletarian revolutionaries, unite! Break private interests and establish public interests, revolution to the end! The motherland needs such successors, the Party's cause needs such successors.

    The revolutionary workers and students in the Wuhan region have inspired and supported each other in the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army, sharing life and death together, forging a deep friendship in battle. We should cherish this friendship a thousand times over and develop it in future battles.

    Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are watching us!

    The people of the whole country are watching us!

    Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud!

    决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望
    《长江日报》三日社论
      “风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。”
    一个无产阶级革命派的新武汉，随着武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的被抛进历史垃圾箱，而即将诞生在中原的大地上！
    “武汉无产阶级革命派大团结万岁！”
    《人民日报》传来了毛主席的声音，传来了党中央的声音。这是对武汉无产阶级革命派的殷切期望，同时也是对武汉无产阶级革命派新的考验。
    能不能紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，正确处理人民内部矛盾，搞好革命派队伍的大团结，是检验真正无产阶级革命派还是小资产阶级革命派的试金石。
    真正无产阶级革命派，心胸最开阔，眼光最远大。
    真正无产阶级革命派，对敌人充满阶级的仇恨，英勇搏斗，不怕牺牲，他们是大无畏的战士；对同志满怀阶级的友爱，有不同的意见，并不奇怪，通过协商解决，他们是识大体顾大局的模范。
    每一个真正的无产阶级革命派，都要学会正确处理人民内部矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，集中打击主要的敌人。
    毛主席反复教导我们：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”风头主义、山头主义、分裂主义，是腐朽没落的资产阶级的恶劣作风，是妨害革命大团结的腐蚀剂。无产阶级革命派，是最光明磊落的共产主义战士。他们不图名誉，不谋私利，一切都是为着全人类的解放。他们是砸碎旧世界的英雄，也是破私立公的先锋。因为他们知道，革自己头脑中“私”字的命，正是共产主义事业的需要。
    真正有希望的，是那些善于思考的人，而不是那些搞山头，出风头的人。
    无产阶级革命派，联合起来！这是阶级斗争的需要，是武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的需要。党内、军内一小撮资产阶级代表人物和“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头已被暴露在光天化日之下，但是，他们人还在，心不死，还在耍阴谋、搞诡计、挑拨离间，企图制造无产阶级革命派的分裂，以图一逞。敌人需要的，我们决不能干！
    无产阶级革命派，联合起来！这是群众的呼声。我们不要忘记了共同走过的艰苦的道路，不要忘记我们之间的深厚的战斗友谊。我们应该永远团结，凝聚成更加坚强有力的铁拳，狠狠地砸向共同的阶级敌人。
    无产阶级革命派，联合起来！破私立公，革命到底！祖国需要这样的接班人，党的事业需要这样的接班人。
    武汉地区的革命工人和革命学生，在向党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中互相鼓舞，互相支援，同生死共患难，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。我们应该千百倍地珍惜这种友谊，并在今后的战斗中发展这种友谊。
    毛主席、党中央在看着我们！
    全国人民在看着我们！
    毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气！
