Tens of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the capital held a grand rally today in the magnificent Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome the Chinese Red Guards delegation, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, who had successfully completed their visit to Albania and returned to Beijing, back to Chairman Mao's side.

The meeting expressed that, under the current favorable international and domestic situation, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the country will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion of the proletariat, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They will unite with the heroic people and youth of Albania and the revolutionary people and youth of the world, fight together, and push the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!

Central leaders, members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and responsible comrades from other sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Jiang Qing, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Zhao Yimin, Ye Qing, Wang Dongxing, Wu Faxian, Qiu Huizuo, Wang Xinting, Li Tianhuan, and Zhang Xiuquan, attended the meeting.

Ambassador Natanaili of Albania and his wife, as well as diplomatic personnel from the Albanian embassy, were invited to attend the meeting.

Today, the Great Hall of the People was filled with a fiery revolutionary fighting spirit and a strong atmosphere of proletarian internationalist friendship. Above the stage hung a giant portrait of Mao Zedong, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. The red banners hanging in the hall read: "Long live our great leader, teacher, commander, and helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the militant friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Albania!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great unity of revolutionary people and youth around the world!"

At 4:20 PM, Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and other comrades, Ambassador Natanaili, and the delegation members of the Chinese Red Guards, including Yao Wenyuan, Tan Houlan, Liu Xichang, Song Yimin, Chen Ganfeng, Cheng Jinhua, and Gao Jinghui, walked onto the stage together. The entire hall erupted in thunderous applause, and ten thousand people shouted: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

The meeting began with the majestic singing of "The East Is Red."

Comrade Xie Fuzhi first delivered a welcome speech.

He warmly congratulated the Chinese Red Guards delegation on being invited to participate in the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League and their visit to Albania, which enhanced the unbreakable militant friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples, and made a contribution to the international communist movement.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that the great Red Guards movement originated from the homeland of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, Mao Zedong Thought. It is a product of the new stage of socialist revolution in our country and a great innovation of the international communist movement in the 1960s. Under the warm care and guidance of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Red Guards have held high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought and made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, writing an immortal chapter in the history of the international communist movement.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi emphasized that the current domestic and international situation is very favorable. However, we must not forget that imperialism and all reactionaries are unwilling to retreat from the stage of history. They are still continuing to resist, struggle desperately, and launch a fierce counterattack. All revolutionary people and heroic Red Guards must be highly vigilant, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion of the proletariat, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! Push the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!

Comrade Yao Wenyuan then gave a long speech. He said that under the extremely warm care of our supreme commander, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Chinese Red Guards delegation successfully completed its first overseas mission. They returned to Beijing, back to Chairman Mao's side, loaded with the revolutionary spirit and friendship of the Albanian youth and people, their boundless admiration and love for Chairman Mao, and their enthusiastic support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement in China.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan spoke about Comrade Hoxha's cordial reception of the Chinese Red Guards delegation. He said that Comrade Hoxha highly praised the great militant friendship and revolutionary unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of Albania and China, highly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, firmly supported our exposure and smashing of the counter-revolutionary restoration plot of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to usurp the Party, the government, and the army, and enthusiastically praised the Red Guards movement in China, hoping that the Chinese Red Guards would persist with Mao Zedong Thought and make greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said that Comrade Enver Hoxha wished Chairman Mao good health forever and longevity like the southern mountains and asked the Chinese Red Guards delegation to convey the highest revolutionary salute of the Albanian people to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, Premier Zhou, Comrades Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Jiang Qing. At this moment, the entire hall erupted in enthusiastic cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

Comrade Yao Wenyuan introduced the brilliant achievements of the Albanian people and youth in defending the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, in the struggle against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, and in socialist construction. He particularly introduced the revolutionary movement that the Albanian youth are further carrying out.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said that the Chinese Red Guards delegation felt deeply during this overseas visit that Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse guiding the revolutionary people of the world to victory, and deeply felt the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China on the world. We deeply feel that the friendship between China and Albania is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and unbreakable. No matter what storms may arise in the world, we Chinese Red Guards will forever stand together with the revolutionary youth of Albania, fight together, and win together!

Comrade Yao Wenyuan emphasized that the Chinese Red Guards shoulder a great internationalist responsibility. Chairman Mao teaches us that the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all humanity. This includes the task of the world revolution. We Red Guards must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and never forget the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, and never forget the task of the world revolution.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan emphasized that we Red Guards must resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, and further strengthen revolutionary unity. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the criminal faces of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and their counter-revolutionary revisionist line in politics, ideology, theory, organization, and other aspects. We must combine this great criticism with the current struggle to support the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and strike down the handful who want to reverse the wheel of history, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan finally said that we Red Guards will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever loyal to the dictatorship of the proletariat, forever loyal to proletarian internationalism, and forever be the faithful little red soldiers of Chairman Mao!

Comrade Chen Ganfeng, a member of the Chinese Red Guards delegation and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, then spoke. He enthusiastically praised the heroic Albania, which is holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism in the midst of the encirclement by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries; praised the Albanian people and youth for their deep hatred of American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries; and praised the heroic spirit and firm will of the Albanian people and youth to fight to the end with the enemy.

Chen Ganfeng said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha, the Albanian people, with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, have overcome the various difficulties and obstacles created by the imperialists and revisionists, overcome the serious poverty and backwardness left over from the old society, and achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction. From the plains to the mountains, from cities to villages, everywhere you see are people full of vigor and fighting spirit. Chen Ganfeng said that Albania is indeed a towering mountain, and the Soviet revisionists and all kinds of traitors and scoundrels are just a handful of yellow earth.

Chen Ganfeng then introduced the revolutionary situation of the Albanian people and youth. He said that our great leader Chairman Mao said in his telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party: "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party formulated a series of revolutionary measures, and the whole country is advancing rapidly on the revolutionary road, making the great beacon of socialism shine even brighter.

Chen Ganfeng said that during this visit, we deeply felt that the friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is deep and sincere revolutionary friendship. As Chairman Mao said: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We and you are not those false friends with honeyed words and poisonous hearts, not those two-faced people." All imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries will surely fail completely in the face of our ironclad unity.

Comrade Tan Houlan, a member of the Chinese Red Guards delegation and a standing committee member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Normal University, said in his speech that before our overseas visit, our great leader Chairman Mao and the central leadership comrades of the Party and the Central Cultural Revolution Group repeatedly instructed us to be modest and to learn well from the Albanian comrades. This time, we went to learn from the heroic Albanian people and youth as instructed by Chairman Mao.

Tan Houlan said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League was actually a grand gathering of left-wing youth organizations from around the world. In the speeches at the congress, many representatives highly praised Chairman Mao and gave high evaluations of Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism, fully reflecting their boundless love and admiration for our great leader. They said: Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist of the contemporary era, the greatest leader of the contemporary era, Mao Zedong Thought is the highest Marxism-Leninism of the contemporary era, and it is a truth that applies to all four seas. In the contemporary era, whether one is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary depends on one's attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought.

Tan Houlan said that in our contact with representatives from various countries, many country representatives paid great attention to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and expressed strong support for it. They said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the brilliant development of Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's great contribution to the international communist movement, and a great treasure of the world's people.

Tan Houlan said that when we think of the world's revolutionary people and youth loving Chairman Mao so much, studying Mao Zedong Thought so hard, and highly praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement in our country, we deeply feel the great responsibility of our revolutionary youth and Red Guards. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: The proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all humanity. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the revolutionary situation in the world, more firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, and never forget the oppressed peoples of the world, and never forget the task of the world revolution.

Tan Houlan finally said that we must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the struggle, and defend the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our lives and blood. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seriously reform our thoughts, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to make new contributions and achievements for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. In the great waves of class struggle, we will strive to cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The speeches of the Red Guards delegation members aroused thunderous applause from the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses shouted again and again: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the reactionaries of various countries!" "Long live China-Albania friendship!" "Long live the unity of Chinese and Albanian youth!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!"

Those attending the meeting also included responsible comrades from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, the Capital Workers' Congress, the Capital Peasants' Congress, the Revolutionary Committees of colleges and universities, and middle schools, as well as representatives from other sectors, including Wu De, Zheng Weishan, Nie Yuanzi, Ding Guoyi, Gao Yangwen, Liu Fu, Wang Jingrui, Miao Yongkun, Luo Ruihua, Zhang Guifu, Kuai Dafu, Han Aijing, and Li Dongmin, as well as members of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.

At the end of the meeting, all ten thousand people stood up and sang "The Internationale" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" accompanied by the military band. (Photos attached)

Revolutionary masses and Red Guards from various sectors in the capital held a grand rally on August 2 in the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome the Chinese Red Guards delegation, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, who had successfully completed their visit to Albania and returned to the country.

    谢富治同志首先致欢迎词。
    他热烈祝贺中国红卫兵代表团应邀参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会和对阿尔巴尼亚的访问，增进了中阿两党、两国人民和青年的牢不可破的战斗友谊，为国际共产主义运动作出了贡献。
    谢富治同志说，伟大的红卫兵运动发源于当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义即毛泽东思想的故乡，她是我国社会主义革命新阶段的产物，是二十世纪六十年代国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。在我们的伟大统帅毛主席的亲切关怀和教导下，在中央文革小组的指导下，红卫兵小将高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，为我国无产阶级文化大革命立下了丰功伟绩，在国际共产主义运动史上写下了不朽的篇章。
    谢富治同志强调说，目前，国内外是一派大好形势。但是，我们不要忘记，帝国主义和一切反动派是不甘心退出历史舞台的，他们还在继续顽抗、垂死挣扎、疯狂反扑。全体革命人民和英雄的红卫兵小将一定要百倍提高警惕，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更进一步地发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透，批倒、批臭，搞好本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
    姚文元同志接着作了长篇讲话。他说，在我们的最高统帅、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的极其亲切的关怀下，在党中央和中央文革小组直接领导下，中国红卫兵代表团胜利地完成了第一次出国任务，满载着阿尔巴尼亚青年和人民的革命精神和革命友谊，满载着他们对毛主席的无限敬仰和热爱，满载着他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动的热情支持，回到了北京，回到了毛主席的身边。
    姚文元同志谈到霍查同志对中国红卫兵代表的亲切接见时说，霍查同志高度赞扬了阿中两党、两国人民和两国青年之间的伟大战斗友谊和革命团结，高度赞扬了中国的无产阶级文化大革命，坚决支持我们揭露和粉碎党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡政、篡军的反革命复辟阴谋，并热情赞扬了中国的红卫兵运动，希望中国红卫兵把毛泽东思想坚持到底，在无产阶级文化大革命中做出更大的贡献。
    姚文元同志说，恩维尔·霍查同志祝毛主席身体永远健康，寿比南山，并要中国红卫兵代表团向毛主席和林副主席以及周总理、陈伯达、康生、江青同志，转达阿尔巴尼亚人民最崇高的革命敬礼。这时，全场响起一片热烈的欢呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”
    姚文元同志介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，勇敢地站在捍卫马克思列宁主义革命路线的最前列，在反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就。他特别介绍了阿尔巴尼亚青年正在进一步开展的革命化运动。
    姚文元同志说，中国红卫兵代表团这次出国，深深地感受到毛泽东思想是照耀全世界革命人民走向胜利的灯塔，深刻地感受到中国无产阶级文化大革命在世界上的巨大影响。我们深深感到，中阿友谊深入人心，牢不可破。不管世界上将发生什么风暴，我们中国红卫兵，永远同阿尔巴尼亚革命青年团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    姚文元同志强调说，中国红卫兵肩担着重大的国际主义责任。毛主席教育我们说，无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己，这是包括了世界革命的任务的。我们红卫兵，应当坚决执行毛主席的教导，心中时刻不要忘记全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族，不要忘记世界革命的任务。
    姚文元同志强调说，我们红卫兵要坚决响应毛主席和党中央的号召，深入开展革命的大批判，继续加强革命的大联合。我们要把中国的赫鲁晓夫以及彭德怀、罗瑞卿等党内、军内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的罪恶面目，和他们那一套反革命修正主义路线，从政治、思想、理论、组织等各个方面，揭狠、揭深，斗倒、斗垮，批透、批臭，把这个大批判，同当前支持武汉无产阶级革命派、打击一小撮妄想倒转历史车轮的反动派的斗争，紧紧结合起来，同各单位斗、批、改结合起来。
    姚文元同志最后说，我们红卫兵永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远忠于无产阶级专政，永远忠于无产阶级国际主义，永远做毛主席忠实的红小兵！
    中国红卫兵代表团团员、上海市革命委员会常委、上海同济大学革命委员会主任陈敢峰同志接着讲话。他热情地赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚是在帝、修、反重重包围之中高举反帝反修革命大旗的伟大的社会主义国家；赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年对美帝、苏修和各国反动派有着无比的仇恨；赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年坚决与敌人斗争到底的英雄气概和反帝反修的坚强意志。
    陈敢峰说，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，发扬艰苦奋斗，自力更生的精神，战胜了帝修制造的种种困难和障碍，克服了旧社会遗留下来的严重贫困和落后，在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。从平原到山区，从城市到农村，到处看到的是意气风发，斗志昂扬的人民。陈敢峰说，阿尔巴尼亚的的确确是一座耸入云霄的高山，苏修和一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼都不过是一抔黄土。
    陈敢峰接着介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年革命化的情况。他说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大的贺电中说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大制定了一系列革命化的措施，全国在革命化的大道上飞速前进，使这盏伟大的社会主义明灯发出更加灿烂的光辉。
    陈敢峰说，在这次访问中，我们深深体会到，中阿两党、两国人民、两国青年之间的友谊是深厚的真挚的革命的友谊。正如毛主席所说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。”一切帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派必将在我们这种钢铁般的团结面前遭到彻底的失败。
    中国红卫兵代表团团员、北京市革命委员会常委、北京师范大学革命委员会主任谭厚兰同志在讲话中说，在我们出国访问前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和党中央领导同志、中央文革小组同志一再教导我们要谦逊，要很好地向阿尔巴尼亚同志学习。我们这次就是遵照毛主席他老人家的最高指示去向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年学习的。
    谭厚兰说，这次阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会，实际上是一次世界性青年左派组织的大集会。在大会发言中，很多代表高度颂扬毛主席，高度评价毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展，充分体现了他们对我们伟大领袖的无限热爱、无限崇拜。他们说：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义者，当代最伟大的领袖，毛泽东思想是当代最高的马克思列宁主义，是放之四海而皆准的真理。在当代，革命、不革命或反革命就是看对待毛泽东思想的态度。
    谭厚兰说，我们在和各国代表的接触中，很多国家代表都非常关注中国无产阶级文化大革命，并对中国无产阶级文化大革命表示了热烈的支持。他们说：中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东思想天才的发展，是毛主席对国际共产主义运动的伟大贡献，是世界人民的巨大财富。
    谭厚兰说，当我们想到世界革命人民和青年那样无限热爱毛主席，那样努力学习毛泽东思想，那样高度赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动时，我们深深感到我国革命青年和红卫兵责任的重大。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己。因此，我们应当更加关心世界革命的形势，更加坚决支持世界人民的革命斗争，心中时刻不要忘记全世界被压迫人民，时刻不要忘记世界革命的任务。
    谭厚兰最后说，我们一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加斗争，用生命和鲜血保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、保卫林副主席、保卫中央文革小组，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，认真改造思想，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，继续为无产阶级文化大革命立新功、建新劳，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，努力把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业坚强可靠的接班人。
    红卫兵代表团同志们的讲话，激起了一阵阵雷鸣般的热烈掌声。革命群众一遍又一遍地高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！”“中阿友谊万岁！”“中阿青年团结万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”
  “毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    参加大会的，还有北京市革命委员会、首都工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会的负责成员和其他方面的代表吴德、郑维山、聂元梓、丁国钰、高扬文、刘福、王景瑞、苗永昆、罗瑞华、张桂福、蒯大富、韩爱晶、李冬民，以及北京市革命委员会的委员们。
    大会结束时，全场万人起立，在军乐队伴奏下齐唱《国际歌》和《大海航行靠舵手》。（附图片）
