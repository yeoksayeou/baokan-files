The "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" concocted by the running dogs of American imperialism emerges. The American master hurriedly cheers for its reactionary alliance that is anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people.

New York, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) — Bangkok: The new anti-China, anti-communist organization, the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations," was established in Bangkok on Aug. 8 under the command of the fascist military regime of Indonesia's Suharto-Nasution, at the behest of the American master.

According to Agence France-Presse, to finally concoct this reactionary alliance, the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, along with the puppet deputy prime minister of "Malaysia" and the puppet foreign minister of "Singapore," held a four-day secret meeting in Bangkok starting on Aug. 5. On Aug. 8, they issued a joint declaration announcing the establishment of this reactionary alliance. The Indonesian reactionaries have been running around for more than half a year to concoct this reactionary alliance. Initially, they named this alliance the "Regional Cooperation Organization" of Southeast Asia. After fierce debates at this Bangkok secret meeting, they decided to name this counter-revolutionary organization the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations."

The declaration of this counter-revolutionary alliance tries to conceal its reactionary nature, deceiving itself and others by saying that its "goals and purposes" are to "promote active cooperation and mutual assistance in areas of common concern such as economics, society, culture, technology, science, and administration," in order to "strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community of Southeast Asian nations."

However, lies are still lies. The declaration still reveals its true intentions, showing that the so-called cooperation in economics, culture, and other areas is merely a cover. The declaration openly states that it will maintain close and beneficial cooperation with existing anti-China, anti-communist international and regional organizations and utilize all means to strengthen cooperation with them. The declaration also shamelessly defends the establishment of aggressive military bases by American imperialism in Southeast Asia, claiming that "all foreign bases in this region are temporary," and that their purpose is "not to directly or indirectly destroy the national independence and freedom of this region." This is an admission that the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" is merely a twin brother of the aggressive "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and a component of the American imperialist encirclement of China.

This reactionary alliance was established, and immediately received praise from American imperialism. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on Aug. 8 welcoming the establishment of this reactionary alliance.

    美帝走狗拼凑的“东南亚国家联盟”出笼
    美国主子急忙为其反华反共反人民的反动联盟喝彩叫好
    新华社九日讯　曼谷消息：由印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权奉美国主子之命出面拼凑的新的反华反共组织——“东南亚国家联盟”，八日在曼谷鸣锣开张。
    据法新社报道，为了最后凑成这个反动联盟，印度尼西亚、菲律宾和泰国的外交部长以及“马来西亚”的傀儡副总理，“新加坡”的傀儡外交部长，从八月五日起在曼谷举行四天黑会。八日，他们发表联合宣言，宣布这个反动联盟的成立。印尼反动派为了拼凑这个反动联盟奔走了半年多，起初把这个联盟的名字叫做东南亚“地区性合作”组织。在这次曼谷黑会上经过激烈争论，决定把这个反革命组织的名称叫做“东南亚国家联盟”。
    这个反革命联盟的宣言竭力掩盖它的反动性，自欺欺人地说什么它的“目标和宗旨”是“在经济、社会、文化、技术、科学和行政方面的共同关心的问题上促进积极的合作和互助”，“以求加强建立一个繁荣、和平的东南亚国家共同体的基础”。
    但是，谎言毕竟是谎言。宣言仍然露出了马脚，表明所谓经济、文化等“合作”只不过是个幌子。宣言公开表示要同现有的反华反共的国际和区域性组织“保持紧密的有利的合作，并且利用一切途径加强同它们之间的合作”。宣言还明目张胆地为美帝国主义在东南亚建立侵略性军事基地辩护，胡说“这个区域内的所有外国基地都是暂时性的”，“目的不是直接或间接地用来破坏这个地区的民族独立和国家自由”。这就不打自招地供认：“东南亚国家联盟”只不过是侵略性的“东南亚条约组织”的孪生兄弟，是美帝国主义反华包围圈的一个组成部分。
    这个反动联盟刚刚成立，马上就得到美帝国主义的喝彩。据美联社报道，美国国务院八日发表声明对这个反动联盟的成立表示“欢迎”。
