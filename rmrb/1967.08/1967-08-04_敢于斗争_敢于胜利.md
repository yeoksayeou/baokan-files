    Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win
    Battle Hero Shū Jīchéng

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "In strategy, we must despise all enemies. In tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." In the face of the brutal armed aggression and armed suppression by the ferocious imperialists and their running dogs, whether we dare to rebel against them, dare to despise the enemy, and dare to take up arms to engage in a head-on struggle with them, is the touchstone to test true revolutionaries and true Marxist-Leninists. The Soviet revisionist clique led by Khrushchev, the handful of power-holders in our party who are taking the capitalist road, and all old and new revisionists, all spread the reactionary fallacy that imperialism is invincible, and implement the reactionary policy of capitulationism, causing serious losses to the international communist movement and the revolutionary movement of the world's peoples. Revolutionary people must expose the ugly faces of these traitors, settle their accounts, purge their influence, and thoroughly eliminate all cowardly thoughts of fearing imperialism and reactionaries.

    Chairman Mao says: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment is a powerful spiritual weapon for inspiring the world's revolutionary people to defeat American imperialism and its running dogs, and is also a powerful weapon for us to smash the modern revisionism of the Soviet Union and the traitorous philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchevs who oppose revolution and betray revolution. The history of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution proves that all reactionary forces that seem strong, no matter how stubborn they are, will eventually be destroyed by progressive forces that seem weak. Our practice of struggling against American imperialism proves that no matter how ferocious and menacing it is, it is just a paper tiger that will be easily pierced in front of revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it was some young air force warriors who had only flown a few dozen hours who shot down the so-called "world champion" pilots of the United States. Once, our two eagles were returning when they suddenly discovered four enemy planes tailing them, preparing to attack. Just at this critical moment when the position was unfavorable, our pilots, with swift actions, turned around and charged towards the enemy planes. The enemy, seeing the situation, was frightened and fled in panic, and our planes took the opportunity to shoot down and damage three enemy planes. The "world champion" paper tiger was thus pierced by our air force warriors who had just entered the battlefield.

    In coastal anti-aircraft warfare, we were able to shoot down American and Kuomintang planes several times mainly because we spiritually overwhelmed the enemy. From actual combat, I deeply feel that spiritual atomic bombs are much stronger and more useful than material atomic bombs. No matter how much better the enemy's weapons and technology are than ours, as long as we can follow Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to pursue and attack fiercely, and spiritually overwhelm the enemy, we can fully utilize all our advantages and defeat all enemies that dare to invade. In the face of seemingly powerful enemies, only by despising them strategically and daring to struggle against them can we achieve victory and take their place. Here, the word "dare" is an important condition. As Chairman Mao said: "All the people of the world must have the courage to dare to fight, not to fear difficulties, and to advance bravely. In that case, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed." For American imperialism, this "giant," we must not only dare to expose it but also dare to destroy it. Together with all revolutionary people of the world, we will one day bury it completely.

    敢于斗争　敢于胜利
    战斗英雄　舒积成
    毛主席教导我们：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”在穷凶极恶的帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略和武装镇压面前，敢不敢造它们的反，敢不敢藐视敌人，敢不敢拿起武器和它们进行针锋相对的斗争，这是检验真假革命和真假马克思列宁主义的试金石。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，我国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切新老修正主义者，都竭力散布帝国主义不可战胜的反动谬论，推行投降主义的反动政策，给国际共产主义运动和世界人民的革命运动造成了严重的损失。革命人民必须识破这帮叛徒的丑恶嘴脸，清算他们的罪行，肃清他们的影响，彻底铲除一切害怕帝国主义和反动派的怯懦思想。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”毛主席的这一英明论断，是鼓舞世界革命人民战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的强大精神武器，也是我们粉碎苏联现代修正主义和中国的赫鲁晓夫之流反对革命、出卖革命的叛徒哲学的强大武器。中国革命和世界革命的历史证明，一切貌似强大的反动力量，不管它们怎样顽固，总是要被看来似乎弱小的进步力量所消灭。我们和美帝国主义斗争的实践证明，不管它多么张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士面前，总归是一戳即破的纸老虎。在抗美援朝战争中，打掉美国所谓“世界王牌”驾驶员的，就是一些刚刚飞了几十个小时的年轻的空军战士。一次，我们的两只雄鹰在返航途中，突然发现四架敌机正咬尾跟后，准备攻击。就在这地位不利的紧急时刻，我们的飞行员以迅猛的动作，调头冲向敌机。敌人一见来势，吓破了胆，慌忙逃窜，我机趁机击落击伤敌机三架。“世界王牌”这只纸老虎，就这样被我初上战场的空军战士戳穿了。
    在沿海对空作战中，我们所以能够几次击落美蒋飞贼，也主要是因为在精神上压倒了敌人。从实战中，我深深体会到：精神原子弹比物质原子弹要强大得多，有用得多。不管敌人的武器和技术比我们高多少，只要我们能按毛主席的教导，敢于猛追猛打，在精神上压倒敌人，就能充分发挥我们的一切优势，击败一切敢于来犯之敌。在貌似强大的敌人面前，只有从战略上藐视它，敢于同它进行斗争，才能战而胜之，取而代之。这里，“敢”字是一个重要条件。正如毛主席所说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”对于美帝国主义这个“庞然大物”，我们一定要不但敢于戳穿它，而且敢于消灭它。我们和全世界革命人民一起，总有一天会把它彻底埋葬。
