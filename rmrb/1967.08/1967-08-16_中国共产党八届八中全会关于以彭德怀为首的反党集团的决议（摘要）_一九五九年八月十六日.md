Before the July 1959 meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee at Lushan, and during the Lushan meeting, a small group of right-opportunist anti-party elements led by Peng Dehuai, including Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Xiaozhou, launched a fierce attack against the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. This attack came at a time when domestic and foreign reactionary forces were exploiting certain temporary and partial shortcomings in our country's Great Leap Forward and People's Communes to intensify their attacks on the Party and the people of China. At such a critical moment, an attack from within the Party, especially from within the Party Central Committee, was obviously more dangerous than an attack from outside the Party. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee believes that it is absolutely necessary to resolutely smash the activities of the right-opportunist anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai, not only to defend the Party's general line but also to defend the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to defend the unity of the Party, and to defend the socialist cause of the Party and the people.

Peng Dehuai and his anti-party clique have long been engaged in activities to split the Party. Before the Lushan meeting, on July 14, 1959, Peng Dehuai wrote a letter to Comrade Mao Zedong expressing his opinions, and during the entire Lushan meeting, his speeches and talks represented the program of the right-opportunist elements attacking the Party. Although they outwardly claimed to support the general line and Comrade Mao Zedong, in essence, they incited Party members with rightist tendencies, those who were dissatisfied with the Party, opportunists who had infiltrated the Party, and class enemies within the Party to respond to the slanders of domestic and foreign reactionaries, launching a fierce attack on the Party's general line and the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Peng Dehuai collected and exaggerated certain temporary, partial, and already overcome or rapidly overcoming shortcomings, portraying the current situation in China as utterly bleak. He essentially denied the victories of the general line, denied the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, opposed the high-speed development of the national economy, opposed the high-yield movement in agriculture, opposed the mass movement to produce steel, opposed the People's Communes movement, opposed the mass movement in economic construction, and opposed the Party's leadership in the socialist construction cause, i.e., "political command." In his letter, he openly slandered the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Party and the hundreds of millions of people as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," even claiming in his talks that "if it weren't for the good Chinese workers and peasants, there would have been a Hungarian incident, and we would have to ask the Soviet army to come in." Clearly, the errors he made were not individual in nature but were right-opportunist line errors of an anti-party, anti-people, and anti-socialist nature.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has exposed a large number of facts, including those admitted by Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Xiaozhou, and their accomplices and followers, proving that the activities of the anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai during and before the Lushan meeting were purposeful, prepared, planned, and organized. This activity is a continuation and development of the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance. It has now been ascertained that Peng Dehuai and Huang Kecheng had long formed an anti-party alliance with Gao Gang and were important members of this alliance. Zhang Wentian also participated in Gao Gang's factional activities. During the struggle against the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance, the Party Central Committee already knew of some facts about Peng Dehuai and Huang Kecheng's participation in this anti-party alliance, gave them serious criticism, and hoped they would learn from their mistakes and repent. However, Peng Dehuai and Huang Kecheng, although they outwardly made self-criticisms, did not actually recognize and correct their mistakes but instead concealed important facts about their participation in this anti-party alliance activities for a long time and continued to develop their anti-party, splitist activities. To achieve his personal ambition, he had long been viciously attacking and slandering the Party's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and other leaders of the Central Committee and Military Commission within the Party and the army, using methods such as promising positions, pulling strings, striking first and then reconciling, sowing discord, spreading rumors, and fabricating lies to engage in factionalist, splitist activities. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the whole Party and the whole people united and worked actively, but he schemed to sabotage the leadership of the Central Committee, engage in anti-party activities, and look for an opportunity to attack the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong with his accomplices and followers. The Lushan meeting was seen by him as a suitable opportunity. Due to Peng Dehuai's position in the Party Central Committee and the People's Liberation Army, and due to his pretenses of frankness and simplicity, his activities were able to deceive some people and had already deceived some people, posing a great danger to the future of the Party and the People's Liberation Army. For this reason, exposing the true face of this hypocrite, careerist, and conspirator, and stopping his anti-party, splitist activities, could not but become an important task for the Party and all those loyal to the Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the socialist cause.

Peng Dehuai's errors this time are not accidental; they have deep social, historical, and ideological roots. Peng Dehuai and his accomplices and followers are essentially representatives of a part of the bourgeoisie who participated in our Party during the democratic revolution. He joined the Party and the revolutionary army led by the Party with the idea of "investing," always wanting to lead others and the collective but not wanting to be led by others or the collective. He did not regard the achievements of the revolutionary work he undertook as the achievements of the Party and the people's struggle but attributed all the merits to himself. His anti-party activities are a reflection of the class struggle in which the Chinese bourgeoisie opposes the socialist revolution of the proletariat, attempting to transform the Party, the army, and the world according to the bourgeois mold. Since his worldview is incompatible with and contrary to the Marxism-Leninism of the revolutionary proletariat, he naturally did not want to accept the leadership of Marxism-Leninism represented by Comrade Mao Zedong within the Party. At several major junctures in the Party's history, such as the Li Lisan line period, the first and second Wang Ming line periods, and the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance period, he stood on the side of the wrong line to oppose the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. After the January 1935 Party meeting in Zunyi established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership over the entire Party and army, he still opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership and engaged in splitist activities within the Party and the army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he treated the regions he was responsible for as independent kingdoms and as capital for his independence from the Party Central Committee. Although the Party had already firmly criticized and corrected the errors of the second Wang Ming line, he insisted on executing the wrong strategic line of the Wang Ming line and repeatedly suppressed the anti-feudal struggles of the peasants in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region. The serious political and organizational errors he made during his work in North China, although exposed and criticized by the Party Central Committee in 1945, he never recognized and corrected his mistakes. On the contrary, due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, the revolution changed from a bourgeois democratic nature to a proletarian socialist nature, his anti-party activities became even more rampant. As soon as the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce began, he joined forces with Gao Gang to engage in anti-party activities. The Gao-Rao anti-party alliance collapsed, and the socialist revolution on the economic and ideological fronts rapidly advanced. The victory of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes movement obviously doomed the final demise of the capitalist economy and individual economy. Under such conditions, the remnants of the Gao Gang clique led by Peng Dehuai and other various right-opportunist elements could not wait and, using what they thought were "favorable" opportunities, stirred up trouble to oppose the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and to oppose the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Therefore, the essence of their attack on the Party was to represent the interests of the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, to split and disperse the vanguard of the proletariat, to organize opportunist factions, to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to sabotage the socialist revolution.

As mentioned above, the long-standing anti-party activities of the right-opportunist anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai are a serious danger to the Party and the people's socialist cause. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee believes that, to be responsible for the future of the Party and the People's Liberation Army, and to be responsible for the interests of the proletariat and the working people's socialist cause, the Party must take a resolute and serious attitude to thoroughly smash the activities of the right-opportunist anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai. The Party demands that Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Xiaozhou thoroughly admit and expose their mistakes to the Party and thoroughly correct their mistakes in practical actions. Apart from this, there is no other way out. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee believes that the Party should adopt a wholehearted attitude towards Peng Dehuai to help him recognize and correct his mistakes. Of course, it is necessary to remove Peng Dehuai and Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Xiaozhou from their positions in national defense, foreign affairs, and provincial first secretary. However, their positions as members of the Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee, members of the Political Bureau, and alternate members of the Political Bureau can be retained to observe their future conduct. History has repeatedly proven that under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the policy on intra-party struggle is completely correct, and such intra-party struggle has not weakened the Party but has strengthened it. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is convinced that, at this critical moment in China's socialist cause, conducting this intra-party struggle against the right-opportunist clique led by Peng Dehuai will certainly make the ranks of the Party and the people more consolidated and the fighting spirit of the Party and the people more ardent. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee calls on all Party members to unite as one under the banner of defending the general line and opposing right-opportunism, to unite as one under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong, to lead the brave and diligent 650 million people of the country to advance courageously without wavering, to implement the general line of building socialism with great effort, striving to be the best, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, and to struggle to the end for the great victory of socialism and the great future of communism.

    中国共产党八届八中全会关于以彭德怀为首的反党集团的决议
    （摘要）
    一九五九年八月十六日
    （一）在一九五九年七月党中央召集庐山政治局扩大会议以前，直到庐山会议的一段时间内，在我们党内出现了以彭德怀为首、包括黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等一小批右倾机会主义反党集团反对党的总路线、反对大跃进、反对人民公社的猖狂进攻。这个进攻，正出现在国内外反动势力利用我国的大跃进和人民公社的伟大运动中的某些暂时的、局部的缺点，向我们党和我国人民加紧进攻的时候。在这样一个时机，来自党内特别是来自党中央内部的进攻，显然比来自党外的进攻更为危险。党的八届八中全会认为：坚决粉碎以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义反党集团的活动，不但对于保卫党的总路线是完全必要的，而且对于保卫党的以毛泽东同志为首的中央的领导、保卫党的团结、保卫党和人民的社会主义事业，都是完全必要的。
    （二）以彭德怀为首的反党集团进行分裂党的活动，由来已久。彭德怀在庐山会议前期，即一九五九年七月十四日写给毛泽东同志的意见书，和他在整个庐山会议期间的一些发言和谈话，是代表右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的纲领。它们尽管表面上也装作拥护总路线和拥护毛泽东同志，但是实质上却在煽动党内的有右倾思想的分子、对党不满的分子、混入党内的投机分子和阶级异己分子，起来响应国内外反动派的污蔑，向党的总路线、向党中央和毛泽东同志的领导举行猖狂进攻。彭德怀把那些暂时的、局部的、早已克服了或者正在迅速克服中的缺点收集起来，并且加以极端夸大，把我国目前形势描写成为漆黑一团。他实质上否定总路线的胜利，否定大跃进的成绩，反对国民经济的高速度发展，反对农业战线上的高额丰产运动，反对群众大办钢铁运动，反对人民公社运动，反对经济建设中的群众运动，反对党对于社会主义建设事业的领导即“政治挂帅”。他在意见书中公然把党和几亿人民的革命热情污蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”，甚至在谈话中一再声称，“如果不是中国工人农民好，早就要发生匈牙利事件，要请苏联军队来。”很明显，他所犯的错误不是个别性质的错误，而是具有反党、反人民、反社会主义性质的右倾机会主义路线的错误。
    （三）八届八中全会揭发出来的大量事实，包括彭德怀、黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等所承认和他们的同谋者、追随者所揭发的事实，证明以彭德怀为首的反党集团在庐山会议期间和庐山会议以前的活动，是有目的、有准备、有计划、有组织的活动。这一活动是高饶反党联盟事件的继续和发展。现在已经查明，彭德怀和黄克诚早就同高岗形成了反党的联盟，并且是这一联盟中的重要成员。张闻天也参加了高岗的宗派活动。在反对高饶反党联盟的斗争中，党中央已经知道了彭德怀和黄克诚参与这一反党联盟的若干事实，给了他们以严肃的批评，希望他们得到教训，从此悔悟，并没有加以深究。但是彭德怀和黄克诚虽然表面上作了检讨，实则不但没有认识和改正自己的错误，反而长期对党隐瞒他们参加这一反党联盟活动的某些重要事实，并且继续发展他们的反党的分裂活动。为了实现他的个人野心，他早就在党内和军队内恶毒地攻击和污蔑党的领袖毛泽东同志以及中央和军委其他领导同志，采用封官许愿、拉拉扯扯、先打后拉、挑拨离间、造谣扯谎、散布流言蜚语等等方法，进行宗派主义的、分裂党的活动。在一九五八年大跃进以后，全党全民团结一致，积极工作，而他却处心积虑地阴谋破坏中央的领导，进行反党活动，准备寻找适当的机会同他的同谋者、追随者向党和毛泽东同志进攻。庐山会议就被他看作是一个适当的机会。由于彭德怀在党中央和在人民解放军的地位，也由于他的一套伪装爽直、伪装朴素的手法，他的活动是能够迷惑一些人并且已经迷惑了一些人的，对党和人民解放军的前途是具有很大危险性的。正因为这样，揭露这个伪君子、野心家、阴谋家的真面目，制止他的反党的分裂活动，就不能不成为党和所有忠于党、忠于人民解放军、忠于社会主义事业的人们的重要任务。
    （四）彭德怀这一次所犯的错误不是偶然的，它有深刻的社会的、历史的、思想的根源。彭德怀和他的同谋者、追随者，本质上是在民主革命中参加我们党的一部分资产阶级的代表。他带着“入股”的思想参加了党和党所领导的革命军队，从来只愿领导别人，领导集体，而不愿受别人领导，受集体领导。他不把自己所担任的革命工作的成就看成党和人民的斗争的成就，而把一切功劳归于自己。他的反党活动，正是中国资产阶级反对无产阶级的社会主义革命、企图按照资产阶级面貌来改造党、改造军队、改造世界这样一种阶级斗争的反映。他的世界观既然同革命无产阶级的马克思列宁主义格格不入，背道而驰，他在党内当然就不愿意接受以毛泽东同志为代表的马克思列宁主义的领导。在党的历史上的几个重大关头，例如立三路线时期、第一次王明路线时期、第二次王明路线时期、高饶反党联盟事件时期，他都站在错误路线方面来反对以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线。在一九三五年一月党的遵义会议确立了毛泽东同志在全党全军的领导地位以后，他仍然反对毛泽东同志的领导，并且在党内和军队内进行分裂活动。在抗日战争时期，他把他所负责主持的地区当成独立王国，当成他向党中央闹独立的资本。虽然党已经坚决地批判和纠正第二次王明路线的错误，他仍然坚持执行王明路线的错误的战略方针，并且再三地压抑晋冀鲁豫地区的农民反封建斗争。他在华北工作时期所犯的政治上和组织上的严重错误，虽经一九四五年党中央的揭发和批判，但是他始终没有认识和改正自己的错误。相反，由于人民解放战争的胜利，革命由资产阶级民主性质转入无产阶级社会主义性质，他的反党活动就更为猖狂了。农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造刚一开始，他就同高岗结合起来进行反党活动。高饶反党联盟崩溃了，经济战线和思想政治战线上的社会主义革命迅速地前进了。党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动的胜利，显然注定了资本主义经济和个体经济的最后灭亡。在这样的条件下，以彭德怀为首的高岗集团残余和其他形形色色的右倾机会主义分子，就迫不及待，利用他们认为“有利”的时机兴风作浪，出来反对党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社，反对党中央和毛泽东同志的领导。因此，他们向党进攻的实质，就是要代表资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的利益，分裂和涣散无产阶级先锋队，组织机会主义的派别，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏社会主义革命。
    （五）如上所说，以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义反党集团的由来已久的反党活动，是党和人民的社会主义事业的严重危险。八届八中全会认为：为了对党和人民解放军的前途负责，为了对无产阶级和劳动人民的社会主义事业的利益负责，党必须采取坚决的严肃的态度，彻底粉碎以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义反党集团的活动。党要求彭德怀、黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等彻底向党承认和揭发自己的错误，并且在实际行动中彻底改正自己的错误。除此以外，决没有任何别的出路。八届八中全会认为：党对于彭德怀仍然应该采取满腔热情的态度，帮助他认识和改正自己的错误。当然，把彭德怀和黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟等调离国防、外交、省委第一书记等工作岗位是完全必要的。但是他们的中央委员会委员、中央委员会候补委员、中央政治局委员、政治局候补委员的职务仍然可以保留，以观后效。历史已经多次证明：在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导下的伟大的中国共产党，对于党内斗争的方针是完全正确的，这种党内斗争没有削弱了党而恰恰是加强了党。八届八中全会确信：在我国社会主义事业的紧要关头，进行这一次反对以彭德怀为首的右倾机会主义的党内斗争，一定将使党的队伍和人民的队伍更加巩固，党和人民的斗志更加昂扬。八届八中全会号召全党同志，在保卫总路线、反对右倾机会主义的旗帜下团结一致，在党中央和党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下团结一致，领导全国勇敢勤劳的六亿五千万人民，毫不动摇地奋勇前进，贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，为社会主义的伟大胜利和共产主义的伟大前途而斗争到底。
