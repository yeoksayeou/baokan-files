The revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Electronic Tube Factory resolutely follows Chairman Mao's instructions to believe and rely on the majority of cadres. With the help of the PLA propaganda team stationed at the factory, they have wholeheartedly helped cadres correct their mistakes, united with them in revolution, and boldly used them in work. Currently, out of the fifty middle-level and above cadres in the entire factory, forty-nine have been liberated, with about half participating in the leadership core of the factory or departments.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres. We should not only look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but also at the cadre's entire history and all their work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory, after conducting a comprehensive analysis of the cadres, believed that most of the cadres in the factory have deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. They work diligently and conscientiously. Although they implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement, they were deceived. To help these cadres who made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory conducted serious exposure and criticism of them. Through exposure and criticism, a batch of cadres were boldly liberated. For example, the political director of the factory implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement, and the mistakes were relatively serious. However, after being helped, she recognized her mistakes and dared to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line with a clear attitude, proving that she is a good cadre who corrects her mistakes. Therefore, she was the first to be liberated. Another example is the materials group leader of this factory's movement. In the early stages of the movement, he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and secretly kept the materials that the Party Committee used to attack the masses. However, after the relevant central directives were issued, he immediately handed over these materials. Later, he also seriously reformed his thoughts. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary faction believed that such a cadre is basically good, and after criticism, he recognized and corrected his mistakes, so he was firmly liberated.

However, there are also some cadres who do not immediately recognize the mistakes they have made, and thus have feelings of grievance and resistance towards the proletarian revolutionary faction. Some even lie down and refuse to work. For these cadres, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory also wholeheartedly helped them, often organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works, inspiring them to deeply examine their souls, and reform their thoughts. They also actively educated the masses to objectively deal with the shortcomings and mistakes of cadres and not to hold grudges. The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory believed that some cadres "drank a few sips of water" during the movement and no longer wanted to be cadres, mainly because these cadres did not fully understand the great significance of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and lacked understanding of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Therefore, they helped them raise their awareness, pushing them to the forefront of the revolutionary criticism, letting them receive education in the struggle, and deeply examine their souls. At the same time, they told them: "Whether or not to be a cadre is a small matter, whether or not to make a revolution is a big matter. Whether you stand up or not is essentially a matter of whether you listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." After being helped, these cadres corrected their wrong thoughts and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes and firmly stand up to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory not only dares to and is good at liberating cadres but also dares to and is good at using cadres. They believe that for cadres who have recognized and begun to correct their mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they should be trusted and boldly used, and welcomed to work side by side. If only cadres are liberated but not dared to be used, this is only liberation in name, not in reality. Therefore, they quickly absorbed the liberated cadres into the work, encouraging them to make new contributions and achieve new labor in the revolutionary criticism and work. At the full staff meeting announcing the liberation of the original political director, they suggested to the staff to absorb her into the work of the temporary takeover committee, which was agreed by all the staff of the factory. Later, for the cadres who were liberated one after another, they were assigned appropriate work. Of course, it was not a return to their original positions, but according to actual needs, they took on suitable work. For some cadres who remained at the production posts due to production needs, they were also asked to take on certain social work in their spare time. For some cadres who had a late awakening and were not yet satisfactory to the masses, the proletarian revolutionary faction also helped them in a sincere comrade-like manner to correct their mistakes at work.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this factory has emerged many outstanding fighters, becoming the new blood of the cadre team, and the workers also trust the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations. However, when discussing the first-in-command of the factory-level leadership, the responsible person of the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory believed that it should be a politically mature, organizationally capable, and experienced revolutionary cadre to take on the role. Later, after discussion by all the workers of the factory, it was decided that the original deputy director would serve as the director of the factory's revolutionary committee. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations enthusiastically encouraged him, saying: "You dare to do it, we are for the same goal, the burden is shared, let's move forward together under the trust of the Party and the masses." In the departmental revolutionary committees, there are also some cadres serving as the first-in-command.

When doing this, some comrades were worried that cadres would seize power and turn into a counter-revolutionary seizure of power. They brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works and quickly corrected this view. They said: We rebel, we rebel against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, we rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line, not against the cadres. Handing power over to revolutionary cadres who stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can only consolidate the power of the proletariat, how can it turn into a counter-revolutionary seizure of power? If we always consider whether "you" seize power or "I" seize power, this is the private interest at work, this is the factionalism at work.

After liberating a large number of cadres and establishing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, the revolution and production of this factory immediately took on a new look. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the enthusiasm of cadres and masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works reached an unprecedented height, the revolutionary criticism was carried out vigorously, and "grasp revolution, promote production" achieved remarkable results. In the first half of the year, 60% of the annual plan was completed, an increase of 34% over the same period last year; in July, the plan was overfulfilled by 56%.

    上海电子管厂革命派听毛主席的话相信和依靠干部大多数
    耐心帮助干部　大胆解放干部　放手使用干部
    目前，全厂五十名中层以上干部，已解放四十九名，其中一半左右参加了厂或部门的领导核心
    据新华社上海二十五日电　上海电子管厂无产阶级革命派坚决遵照毛主席要相信和依靠干部的大多数的教导，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，满怀阶级感情，帮助干部改正错误，团结他们一道革命，放手使用他们工作。目前，全厂五十名中层以上干部，已解放四十九名，其中一半左右参加了厂或部门的领导核心。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派，对干部作了全面的分析以后，认为厂里的大部分干部对党对毛主席有深厚的阶级感情，工作勤勤恳恳，踏踏实实，在运动初期虽然执行了资产阶级反动路线，但他们是受蒙蔽的。为了帮助这些犯错误的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，这个厂的无产阶级革命派对他们进行了严肃的揭发和批判。通过揭发批判，大胆解放了一批干部。例如厂里的政治处主任在运动初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，错误比较严重，但是经过帮助，她认识了错误，又敢于起来揭发批判资产阶级反动路线，态度鲜明，证明她是一个知过就改的好干部，就第一个解放了她。又如这个厂的一个运动材料组长，在运动初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，把党委整群众的材料死保不放，但当中央有关通令下达以后，他就马上把这些材料交了出来，以后又能认真改造自己的思想。因此，无产阶级革命派认为，这样的干部基本上是好的，通过批判，他认识和改正了错误，就坚决解放了他。
    但是，也有一部分干部对自己所犯的错误一时认识不清，因而有委屈情绪，对无产阶级革命派有抵触情绪，有的甚至躺倒不干。对于这些干部，这个厂的无产阶级革命派也是满怀阶级感情，对他们进行耐心的帮助，经常组织他们学习毛主席著作，启发他们狠触自己的灵魂，改造自己的思想，并且积极教育群众实事求是地对待干部的缺点错误，不要扭住不放。这个厂的无产阶级革命派认为有的干部在运动中“喝了几口水”，不想再当干部了，主要是这些干部对史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义认识不足，对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争缺乏认识，于是就帮助他们提高认识，把他们推到革命大批判的第一线，让他们在斗争中受教育，狠触自己的灵魂。同时，又告诉他们：“要不要当干部是小事情，要不要革命是大事情。你们是不是站起来，实质上是听不听毛主席的话，跟不跟毛主席革命路线的大问题。”经过帮助，这些干部扭转了错误思想，表示要改正错误，坚决站起来，跟着毛主席革命到底。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派不但敢于和善于解放干部，而且敢于和善于使用干部。他们认为，对于已经认识和开始改正错误，回到毛主席革命路线上来的干部，就应该信任他们，大胆使用，欢迎他们和自己并肩工作。如果只解放干部，不敢放手使用干部，这只是口头上的解放，不是实际上的解放。因此，他们对已经解放了的干部，很快就吸收他们参加工作，鼓励他们在革命的大批判中、在工作中立新功，建新劳。他们在宣布解放原政治处主任的全厂职工大会上，就向职工建议吸收她参加临时接管委员会工作，得到全厂职工的同意。以后对陆续不断解放的干部，都分配一定的工作。当然，并不是官复原职，而是根据实际需要，担任适当工作。对部分由于生产需要仍留在劳动岗位上的干部，也要他们在业余时间担负一定的社会工作。对有些觉悟较迟，群众还不够满意的干部，无产阶级革命派也以恳切的同志的态度，帮助他们在工作中改正错误。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂涌现出许多优秀的战士，成为干部队伍的新鲜血液，职工们对革命群众组织的负责人也是信任的。但在酝酿厂级领导的第一把手时，这个厂的无产阶级革命派的负责人认为，应该让政治上比较成熟、组织能力比较强、斗争经验比较丰富的革命干部来担任。以后，经过全厂职工讨论，确定由原副厂长担任厂的革命委员会主任。革命群众组织的负责人热情地鼓励他说：“你大胆干吧，我们是为着一个目标的，担子是一起挑的，让我们在一起负起党和群众对我们的委托，共同前进。”在部门的革命委员会中，也有一些干部担任了第一把手。
    在这样做的时候，有的同志担心干部掌了权，会变成资产阶级反夺权。他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作，迅速纠正了这种看法。大家说：我们造反，是造的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造的资产阶级反动路线的反，不是造干部的反。把权交给站在毛主席革命路线上的革命干部，只能巩固无产阶级的权，怎么会变成反夺权呢？如果老是考虑“你”掌权，还是“我”掌权，这就是头脑中私字在作怪，山头主义在作怪。
    在解放了大批干部，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的临时权力机构以后，这个厂的革命和生产立即面貌一新。在革命委员会的领导下，干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作的积极性空前高涨，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，“抓革命，促生产”取得了显著的成绩，上半年完成全年计划的百分之六十，比去年同期增长百分之三十四；七月份又超额百分之五十六完成了计划。
