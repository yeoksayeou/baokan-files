Soviet Workers Expose the Lies of the Soviet Revisionists

Soviet Revisionist leader Kosygin, at a meeting in Leningrad, claimed that "caring for people, caring for their happiness, is the highest goal of the state." Let's see how they "care" for the concrete worker Rustam Yusupov.

Yusupov recently wrote a letter to a Soviet newspaper, angrily exposing the difficulties faced by the working class under the rule of the Soviet Revisionist leadership.

He said: "I used to live with my wife and two very young children in a remote forest settlement in Arkhangelsk Oblast. I was a carpenter. In December, I received a letter from my hometown of Angren (Uzbek SSR). My elderly parents were left there. From the letter, I learned that my father had been admitted to a tuberculosis sanatorium, leaving only my mother behind, because my brother Rafik had been conscripted into the army. So, I decided to return to Angren."

Later, Yusupov found work at the Third Construction Administration in Angren as a concrete worker. He said: "On the evening of January 26, I suddenly received terrible news: my wife had died. I had to go back immediately because the children were still there... In the morning, I ran to work and wrote an application to the director, Yakovlev: 'I have suffered a misfortune; please give me 100 rubles, and I will definitely repay it by working.'"

However, Yusupov's application was rejected. Yusupov said: "I never thought that when a person encounters such misfortune, the enterprise leaders could be so cold-hearted. The director said, 'I can't trust every person and lend them 100 rubles. You take what you earn.' I was shocked. I said, 'What should I do?' He replied, 'Do whatever you want.'"

Desperate, Yusupov had no choice but to go back to the director, Yakovlev. Yakovlev impatiently said: "Enough... haven't you seen that I don't have time."

Yusupov was forced to resign and received only 21 rubles in wages. With the help of fellow workers, he managed to gather enough money for the journey back home to take care of his children.

Yusupov said, "I returned to the Third Construction Administration—just to prove that I am not a scoundrel. Yakovlev was even surprised to see me. I said, 'It seems that before I left, I had asked you to believe that I did not intend to run away for 100 rubles.'"

"To be honest, I thought that even if he cared about the outcome of my trip, it would be better. But he just sneered and said, 'You must not have gone anywhere.'"

Yusupov's experience is not an isolated incident; it is just one example of the painful life of Soviet workers. The likes of Kosygin keep boasting that "the right to work and rest, free medical care, and welfare benefits have become second nature, and the Soviet people do not worry about unemployment, tyranny, and poverty." However, Yusupov's experience exposes the despicable lies of the Soviet Revisionist leadership, revealing their true face of betraying the interests of the working people.

### 苏联工人戳穿苏修的谎言

    苏联工人戳穿苏修的谎言
    苏修头目柯西金在列宁格勒的一次会议上说什么“关心人，关心人的幸福，是国家的最高目标。”请看他们是怎样“关心”混凝土工人鲁斯塔姆·尤苏波夫的。
    尤苏波夫最近写给苏联一家报纸一封信，愤怒揭露了在苏修领导集团的统治下工人阶级的困难处境。
    他说：“我过去和妻子以及两个很小的孩子一起住在阿尔汉格尔州的一个偏僻的森林居住区里。我是木匠。十二月收到了从我的故乡安格连（乌兹别克共和国）寄来的信。我的年迈的双亲留在那里。从信中知道父亲进了结核病防治所，只留下母亲一个人，因为我的弟弟拉费克被征召入伍了。于是，我就决定回到安格连去。”
    后来尤苏波夫在安格连第三建筑管理局就业，当了混凝土工。他说：“一月二十六日晚上，我突然得到一个可怕的消息，妻子死了。得马上回去，因为孩子还留在那里……早晨跑去上班，给管理局长雅科夫列夫写了个申请：‘我遭到了不幸，请支给我一百个卢布，我一定在回来后做工付还’……”
    但是，尤苏波夫的申请遭到拒绝。尤苏波夫说：“我从来没有想到，当一个人遇到如此不幸时，企业领导人可以这样冷酷无情。局长说，‘我不能够对每个碰到的人都信得过借给一百个卢布。你挣多少就拿多少’。我很震惊。我说，我怎么办呢？他回答说：‘你愿怎么办就怎么办’。”
    走投无路的尤苏波夫最后又只得再到管理局长雅科夫列夫那里。而雅科夫列夫不耐烦地说：“唔，够了……你没有看到吗，我没有工夫”。
    尤苏波夫被迫辞职了。只得到二十一个卢布的工资。他在工人们的帮助下，才凑足路费回家去安置孩子。
    尤苏波夫说，“我又回到了这个第三建筑管理局——只是为了证明我不是什么无赖汉。雅科夫列夫看到我时甚至很惊奇。我说：‘好象在临走前我就曾要你们相信，我不打算为了一百个卢布跑掉’。”
    “说真的，我想，那怕他关心一下我这趟来回的结果也好。而他却冷笑着说：‘你一定是那里也没有去’”。
    尤苏波夫的遭遇并不是个别的事件，它只是苏联工人痛苦生活中的一个例子。柯西金之流还一再吹嘘说什么，“劳动权和休息权，免费医疗和优抚保障权已经习惯成自然了，苏联人民不担心失业、专横和贫困。”但是尤苏波夫的遭遇戳穿了苏修领导集团的卑鄙谎言，暴露了他们背叛劳动人民利益的真面目。
