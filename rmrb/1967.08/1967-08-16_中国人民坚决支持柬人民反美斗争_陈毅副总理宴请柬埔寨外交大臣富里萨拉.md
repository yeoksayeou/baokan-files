The Chinese people resolutely support the Cambodian people's anti-American struggle. Vice Premier Chen Yi hosts a banquet for Cambodian Foreign Minister Furisala.

BEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi hosted a banquet this evening to welcome Cambodian Foreign Minister Furisala, who was invited to visit China for a friendly visit. The Cambodian guests arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. They were warmly welcomed by officials from various relevant departments and the people of the capital at the airport.

At tonight's banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Furisala both spoke. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people have always stood firmly with the Cambodian people, resolutely supporting the Cambodian people's just struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys. Cambodian friends can be assured that in the Cambodian people's struggle against American imperialism, 700 million Chinese people will provide strong support.

Vice Premier Chen Yi discussed the current favorable international situation. He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for further expanding their war of aggression in Vietnam, attempting to spread the flames of war to Laos and Cambodia, and even to China. He strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for actively serving the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy on the Vietnam issue. He pointed out that anti-imperialism must also mean anti-revisionism. The Soviet revisionist leadership will inevitably meet the same fate of ultimate failure as the U.S. imperialists.

Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the reactionary factions in India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries who, fearing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fearing their own people's rebellion, have become shameful anti-China vanguards under the orders of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. He said that their anti-China actions will only "backfire," inevitably arousing the resolute opposition of their own people and the people of the world, and accelerating their own downfall.

Foreign Minister Furisala, in his speech, spoke of the friendship between the peoples of Cambodia and China. He said that the Chinese government and the great Chinese people, in the face of aggression and provocation by American imperialism and its puppets in Saigon and Bangkok, have provided multifaceted, selfless, and unconditional assistance to our country's construction and to the maintenance of our independence and sovereignty. Recently, the government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement reaffirming its complete respect and recognition of Cambodia's territorial integrity within its current borders. This once again demonstrates China's consistent support for our just position.

He said that the successful detonation of China's hydrogen bomb is a great victory for the Cultural Revolution. It is the most powerful proof of the great achievements of the great and friendly Chinese people under the prestigious leadership of their great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, in all fields. Every achievement of China is an achievement of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the face of the arrogance and contempt of American imperialists and racists, they feel proud because of China's achievements. This is also a source of inspiration for our uncompromising common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Officials from various relevant departments in China attended the banquet.

Cambodian Ambassador Zhang Gang and diplomats from various countries stationed in China were invited to attend the banquet.

    中国人民坚决支持柬人民反美斗争
    陈毅副总理宴请柬埔寨外交大臣富里萨拉
    新华社十五日讯　国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅今晚举行宴会，欢迎应邀来我国进行友好访问的柬埔寨外交大臣富里萨拉。柬埔寨客人是在今天下午乘飞机到达北京的。他们在机场上受到各有关方面负责人和首都群众的热烈欢迎。
    在今晚的宴会上，陈毅副总理和富里萨拉外交大臣先后讲了话。陈毅副总理说，中国政府和中国人民一贯坚定地同柬埔寨人民站在一起，坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从侵略的正义斗争。柬埔寨朋友可以相信，在柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义的斗争中，七亿中国人民将予以大力支持。
    陈毅副总理谈到了当前大好的国际形势。他强烈谴责美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略越南的战争，妄图把战火扩大到老挝和柬埔寨，甚至扩大到中国。他强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上加紧为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。他指出，反帝必须反修。苏修领导集团必将同美帝国主义一样，逃脱不了最后失败的命运。
    陈毅副总理谴责印度、印尼、缅甸等国的一小撮反动派，害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕本国人民起来大造他们的反，在美帝、苏修的指使下，充当了可耻的反华急先锋。他说，他们反华，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，必将激起他们本国人民和世界人民的坚决反对，加速他们自己的灭亡。
    富里萨拉外交大臣在讲话中谈到柬中两国人民的友谊时说，中国政府和伟大的中国人民，在美帝国主义及其在西贡和曼谷的走狗进行侵略和挑衅的情况下，对我国的建设、对维护我国的独立和主权给了多方面的、无私的和无条件的援助。最近，中华人民共和国政府发表声明，重申完全尊重和承认柬埔寨在目前边界内的领土完整，这再一次表明，中国一贯支持我们的正义立场。
    他说，中国氢弹爆炸成功是文化革命的伟大胜利。它是伟大的、友好的中国人民在他们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席享有威望的领导下，在各方面取得辉煌成就的最有力的证明。中国的每一项成就都是亚、非、拉各国人民的成就。在美国帝国主义者和种族主义者的傲慢和轻蔑面前，他们由于中国的成就而感到自豪。这对我们进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的毫不妥协的共同斗争，也是鼓舞的源泉。
    我国各有关方面的负责人出席了宴会。
    柬埔寨驻中国大使张岗和各国驻中国的使节，应邀出席了宴会。
