	The Farce of the Running Dog Zhang Gang
	Lin Jinran

	“America’s moon is rounder than China’s!” This is a famous saying of Hu Shi. Hu Shi was a comprador intellectual who “bought” Western civilization and “managed” the business of enslaving the Chinese people for forty to fifty years. He was a thorough and through traitor.

	The evil seed does not die out; it is passed on. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Zhang Gang, who wears the cloak of a Communist Party member, has inherited Hu Shi’s legacy.

	In 1956, Zhang Gang went to India to attend a meeting of the “International Theatre Association,” traveling by British airplane. Zhang Gang said: “The service attitude of the plane was very considerate, the plane was also quite comfortable, and the flight was stable.” After feeling comfortable, he sighed with emotion and declared: “The capitalist world is not without some good points,” “This is precisely the shortcoming of our socialism at present,” “There are still many things to learn from Western bourgeoisie.” After riding an imperialist airplane once, he was so enamored with and worshipful of Western bourgeoisie, and used this to attack socialist motherland. This running dog’s behavior is exactly the same as Hu Shi’s!

	However, unfortunately, the airplane flew too slowly, Zhang Gang “only caught the closing ceremony,” and the foreign masters were not very enthusiastic—“As soon as we entered, we met two American representatives. We proactively went up to shake hands, which surprised them very much.” What a “proactive,” what a “went up,” what a “shake hands.” Bowing and scraping to flatter, but in exchange for the foreign masters’ “surprise”! Shameful, shameful, Zhang Gang has lost the face of the Chinese people!

	The master does not show favor, the servant shows enthusiasm. After some “efforts,” Zhang Gang finally “spoke for five minutes” at the closing ceremony. As soon as Zhang Gang went up, he hurriedly expressed “regret,” saying that he “arrived too late,” but he had “already arrived here in spirit to have a friendly chat with these gentlemen.” Then came the cheap flattery, praising Western bourgeoisie theatre as having a “long history” and “rich creativity,” and deciding to pave a “road from east to west or from west to east” with his Western “dear colleagues,” so that Eastern and Western cultures could “merge together.”

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Imperialist culture, “besides the cultural institutions directly operated by imperialism in China, there are also some shameless Chinese people who advocate it.” Hu Shi and Zhang Gang are this kind of shameless Chinese people. The difference is that one, before the Chinese revolution’s victory, vigorously promoted the “culture of enslavement” to obstruct the revolution’s advance; the other, after the Chinese revolution’s victory, desperately peddled the “peaceful evolution” black goods to make capitalism revive in China. Two running dogs, one heart: Not only do they themselves die-heartedly want to be running dogs, but they also want the Chinese people to be running dogs. Extremely despicable! Extremely hateful!

    洋奴张庚的丑剧表演
    林尽染
    “美国的月亮比中国的圆！”这是胡适的一句“名言”。胡适是买办文人，他“买”来了“西方文明”，“办”了四、五十年奴化中国人民的事，是一个彻头彻尾、彻里彻外的洋奴。
    谬种不绝，辗转流传。披着“共产党员”外衣的反革命修正主义分子张庚，师承了胡适的衣钵。
    一九五六年，张庚到印度去了一趟，参加“国际戏剧协会”的讨论会，乘的是英国飞机。张庚说：“该机服务态度甚周到，机上也较舒适，飞行平稳。”舒适之余，便“颇有感慨”地断言：资本主义世界“非一点可取之处也没有”，“这一点恰恰是我们社会主义目前的缺点”，“从西欧资产阶级处可学的东西仍然很多”。乘了一次帝国主义的飞机，就对西方资产阶级如此心向神往、顶礼膜拜，还要借此大肆攻击社会主义的祖国，这种洋奴的媚骨，与当年的胡适一模一样！
    然而，遗憾的是飞机飞得太慢了，张庚“只赶上了一个闭幕式”，而洋主子也并不怎么热情——“一进门就遇见了两位美国代表，我们主动上前与他们握手，很出他们的意外”。好一个“主动”，好一个“上前”，好一个“握手”。卑躬屈膝地献媚，却换来了洋主子的“意外”！丢脸，丢脸，张庚丢尽了中国人民的脸！
    主子不赏脸，奴才献殷勤。经过一番“争取”，张庚终于在闭幕式上“作了五分钟的发言”。张庚一上去，就连忙表示“抱歉”，说是“到得太迟了”，但他同这帮洋大人们“亲切交谈的心却早到了这里”。接着便是廉价的献媚，吹捧西方资产阶级戏剧“有悠久的历史”，“有丰富的创造”，决心要和他的西方的“亲爱的同行们”铺平一条“从东到西或从西到东”的“道路”，让东方和西方的文化“汇合在一起”。
    毛主席教导我们：帝国主义文化，“除了帝国主义在中国直接办理的文化机关之外，还有一些无耻的中国人也在提倡。”胡适、张庚之流就是这类无耻的中国人。所不同的是，一个在中国革命胜利之前，竭力推销“奴化思想的文化”以阻挡革命的前进；一个在中国革命胜利之后，拚命兜售“和平演变”的黑货，以使资本主义在中国复辟。两个洋奴，一个心眼：不仅自己死心塌地甘当洋奴，还要中国人民都当洋奴。可恶之极！可恨之极！
