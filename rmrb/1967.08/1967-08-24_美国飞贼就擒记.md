On the afternoon of August 21, the southern border of our motherland was covered with fluffy white clouds. The people of various ethnic groups in Guangxi, firmly responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," were happily working in the fields. The entire land presented a bustling scene of striving for an even greater harvest.

Just as the members of a certain commune were working, they suddenly heard the shrill sound of an airplane overhead. The members quickly judged: This is an American air pirate invading our airspace to provoke war. At that moment, a loud boom echoed through the sky, and two invading rogue aircraft received their deserved punishment, trailing thick black smoke as they plummeted downward. At this point, the members immediately shouted, "The American airplane has been shot down! The American airplane has been shot down!" Instantly, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the fields and villages.

As the members cheered, a small white dot appeared in the sky. "The American devil is parachuting!" "The American devil is parachuting!" The members shouted as they grabbed their rifles, hoes, and shovels, rushing from all directions towards the landing site of the air pirate. In just over ten minutes, the militia and members had surrounded the landing point and quickly found the parachute. However, there was no sign of the American air pirate. The American air pirate, hoping to escape capture by hiding in the tall grass, was in for a futile attempt in the face of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! The militia and members, from all directions, climbed over steep slopes, through grasslands and forests, tightly encircling the enemy.

Poor peasant member and militia cadre, Lu Guanlin and Luo Kanghua, ran to the front, being the first to discover the American air pirate cowering in the grass. Immediately, they shouted, "The devil is here!" Memories of last September 8, when these American air pirates killed and injured members of Guangxi, killed oxen, and destroyed farmland, surged through their minds. The members, upon hearing the shout, rushed forward. At this moment, PLA soldiers Jia Xueyi and He Zhonghua also arrived at the scene and quickly rushed forward. "Hands up, surrender, and you will not be killed!" The shout struck fear into the heart of the American air pirate, who was always up to no good. He turned pale, trembling all over, kneeling on the ground, and obediently raised his hands, mumbling incoherently as he begged for mercy. In this way, he was captured alive by the Chinese people.

When we saw this American air pirate, he trembled as he told the PLA doctor, "I parachuted down, and in less than twenty minutes, I was captured alive. Fortunately, I am still alive." He said, "I thought that landing in the mountains, I wouldn't encounter anyone, but as soon as I landed, I was surrounded by hundreds of people."

Let the American aggressor, Johnson, boast about their so-called "air superiority"! In the face of the Chinese people armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, the fate awaiting the American aggressors will be the same as this air pirate!

    美国飞贼就擒记
    八月二十一日下午，祖国南疆天空白云朵朵。坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的广西各族人民，正在田间愉快地劳动，整个大地呈现出一片夺取更大丰收的繁忙景象。
    正在劳动的某地的公社各族社员，忽然听到上空响起了飞机的尖叫声。社员们机警地判断：这是美国飞贼侵入我国领空进行战争挑衅了。正在这个时候，只听得轰轰一阵巨响，两架入侵的强盗飞机受到应有的惩罚，拖着一股股浓浓黑烟急剧下坠。这时，社员们立即高喊：“美国飞机被打下来啦！美国飞机被打下来啦！”顿时，到处一片欢腾，“毛主席万岁，毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声，响彻了整个田野山村。
    在社员欢呼的同时，天空中出现了一个小白点。“美国鬼子跳伞了！”“美国鬼子跳伞了！”社员们一面喊着，一面拿着钢枪、扁担、锄头，从四面八方向飞贼降落的地点奔去，仅十多分钟的时间，民兵和社员们就把降落点团团围住，并很快地找到了降落伞。但是，却不见美国飞贼。美国空中强盗，妄想利用深草逃脱被活捉的命运，但是，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国人民面前，这简直是痴心妄想！民兵和社员们从四面八方翻过陡坡，穿过草丛、树林，紧紧地向敌人合围过去。
    贫农社员、基干民兵陆关林、骆康华跑在最前面，最先发现了龟缩在草丛中的美国空中强盗，当即大喊：“鬼子在这里！”去年九月八日，就是这些美国空中强盗杀伤我广西社员，打死耕牛，毁坏农田，旧恨新仇，立即涌上心头，社员们听见喊声，立即奔上前去。这时，人民解放军战士贾学义、何忠华也赶到了现场，立即飞快地冲了上去。“举起手来，缴枪不杀”的喊声，把这个平时一贯为非作歹的美国飞贼，吓得脸色苍白，浑身发抖，跪在地上，乖乖地举起了双手，嘴里连连叽哩咕噜地求饶，就这样被中国人民活捉了。
    当我们看到这个美国飞贼时，他战战兢兢地向人民解放军的军医说：“我跳伞下来，不到二十分钟，就被活捉了。总算幸运，还活着。”他说，“我以为在山区降落，不会碰到什么人，那知道刚一下来，就被几百人包围起来。”
    让美国强盗头子约翰逊吹嘘他们的所谓“空中优势”去吧，在用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民面前，等待美国强盗的，将是和这个飞贼同样的下场！
