	Colonel Dong, Supreme Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, Sends a Telegram Congratulating the PLA on Its Anniversary

	New China News Agency, August 2nd: Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao received a congratulatory telegram from Colonel Dong, Supreme Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	The telegram reads: "On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of all the patriotic neutralist forces and in my personal capacity, extend my warm, sincere, close, and united greetings to you, and through you, convey our greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	"We have always believed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great and powerful army that was forged in the fierce flames of war. It has undergone numerous arduous and complex struggles, defeating the enemy in the fight against Japanese fascism and the American puppet Chiang Kai-shek traitors, achieving brilliant victories. After liberating all of China, it has defended the country's socialist construction and achieved great successes. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has the richest and most glorious experience. At present, we Lao people are learning from and applying these experiences in our struggle to save the nation and resist American imperialism, and we are achieving continuous results.

	On this occasion, the patriotic neutralist forces express our gratitude to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the Chinese people for the great support and assistance they have given us in the Lao people's patriotic struggle against imperialism. We guarantee that we will stand together with the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people in the struggle against our common enemy—American imperialism and its running dogs—and stand together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people. We believe that, relying on our unity, we will surely achieve final victory; we believe that the patriotic forces and people of Laos will surely liberate all of Laos; we believe that the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan and achieve the unification of their motherland.

	We wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army to be even stronger and to achieve greater and newer victories!

	We wish the great Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people a complete success!

	Long live the friendship between the patriotic forces of Laos and the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people!

	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"
