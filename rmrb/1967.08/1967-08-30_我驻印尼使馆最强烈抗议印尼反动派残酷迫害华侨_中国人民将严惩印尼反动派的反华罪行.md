The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged the strongest protest against the savage acts of the Indonesian reactionary government, which has trampled on international norms and illegally arrested and brutally persecuted innocent overseas Chinese.

A note sent by the Chinese Embassy to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 26th expressed strong indignation at the Indonesian government's barbaric actions and lodged the strongest protest.

The note said that since the beginning of this year, the Indonesian government, in order to intensify its anti-China and anti-Chinese policies and push the relationship between the two countries to the brink of complete rupture, has concocted various baseless charges and arbitrarily summoned, illegally arrested, and brutally persecuted overseas Chinese in various places. In Jakarta alone, the military authorities have arrested hundreds of innocent overseas Chinese on the pretext of "subversive activities." The military authorities admitted that more than sixty overseas Chinese are still being detained. In the course of these criminal activities, the Indonesian government has dispatched armed soldiers to raid the homes of overseas Chinese in the middle of the night, conducting illegal searches and arrests; sent plainclothes agents to kidnap innocent overseas Chinese; and even stationed spies near the Chinese Embassy to monitor and photograph overseas Chinese entering and leaving the embassy, using this as a basis for persecuting them. As a result, the personal safety of the broad masses of overseas Chinese has been completely unprotected, and they live in a state of constant fear and terror.

The note said that what is particularly infuriating is that you have subjected the detained overseas Chinese to severe torture and brutal mistreatment in prison, even conducting continuous interrogation for several days and nights without rest, sparing neither elderly people in their sixties nor young girls in their teens. What is even more intolerable is your various forms of humiliation of detained overseas Chinese women.

The note pointed out that the Indonesian government's slander of the broad masses of overseas Chinese for so-called "subversive activities" is a complete fabrication. You have even accused the broad masses of overseas Chinese of holding funerals for the elderly overseas Chinese victimized by you, of exposing your anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, and even of loving the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and studying Mao Zedong Thought, all of which you call "subversive activities." This is utterly absurd and laughable! Is this not the logic of bandits? You brutally persecute overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have the right to hold funerals for their victimized compatriots and to expose your crimes. This is entirely justified. As for the broad masses of overseas Chinese loving the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and studying Mao Zedong Thought, this is their sacred and inviolable right, which no one has the right to take away. It is clear that your so-called accusations of overseas Chinese engaging in "subversive activities" are nothing but a pretext for intensifying your anti-China and anti-Chinese policies and completely destroying the relationship between the two countries.

The note warned the Indonesian government that no matter what tricks you play or how many lies you fabricate and spread, you can never cover up your heinous crimes of brutally persecuting innocent overseas Chinese, nor can you escape the responsibility of completely destroying the relationship between the two countries. The broad masses of overseas Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are absolutely not to be frightened or subdued. Your various acts of persecution against them can only arouse broader and more intense resistance from them. Your frantic anti-China and anti-Chinese policies will inevitably be met with the severest punishment from the 700 million people of China. Your inhuman fascist atrocities will be strongly opposed by the broad masses of the Indonesian people and will be justly condemned by the people of the world. You will not have a good end.

The note sternly demands that the Indonesian government must give a full account of the illegal arrests of overseas Chinese, immediately release all detained overseas Chinese, publicly apologize to them, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Before the detained overseas Chinese are released, the Chinese Embassy has decided to send diplomatic personnel to visit and comfort them in prison. The Indonesian government must make prompt arrangements for this. The above demands must be strictly complied with; otherwise, the Indonesian government will bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

    我驻印尼使馆最强烈抗议印尼反动派残酷迫害华侨
    中国人民将严惩印尼反动派的反华罪行
    新华社二十九日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十六日照会印尼外交部，对印尼反动政府野蛮地践踏国际关系准则，非法逮捕和残酷迫害无辜华侨的法西斯暴行表示极大的愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，今年以来，印尼政府为了加剧反华排华，进一步把两国关系推向完全破裂，挖空心思，凭空捏造了种种莫须有罪名，在各地恣意传讯、非法逮捕和残酷迫害华侨。仅雅加达一地，军事当局就以所谓“颠覆活动”的罪名，非法逮捕了数以百计的无辜华侨。军事当局供认至今仍有六十多名华侨被关押。在进行上述罪恶活动时，印尼政府出动武装军人深更半夜任意闯入华侨住宅进行非法搜捕；派出便衣特务对无辜华侨进行秘密绑架。印尼政府甚至在中国大使馆附近布置密探，对进出大使馆的华侨进行监视和拍照，并据以对他们进行迫害，致使广大华侨人身安全失去最起码的保障，处于惶惶不安的恐怖气氛之中。
    照会说，尤其令人愤慨的是，你们在狱中对被捕华侨进行严刑拷打和残酷折磨，甚至连续几昼夜不停地进行刑讯，连年近花甲的老人和十多岁的女孩子也不能幸免。更不能容忍的是你们对被捕华侨妇女进行百般凌辱。
    照会指出，印尼政府诬蔑广大华侨进行所谓“颠覆活动”，是彻头彻尾的捏造。你们竟把广大华侨为被你们残害至死的华侨老人宁祥雨送葬，把华侨揭露你们反华排华的罪行，甚至把华侨热爱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和学习毛泽东思想都说成是所谓“颠覆活动”，这简直是荒谬绝伦，可笑之至！这不是十足的强盗逻辑又是什么呢？你们残酷迫害华侨，华侨就有权利为受害同胞送葬，就有权利揭露你们的罪行，这完全是天经地义的。至于广大华侨热爱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，学习毛泽东思想，更是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利，任何人也无权剥夺。十分明显，你们所谓华侨进行“颠覆活动”的无耻谰言，只不过是你们为了加剧反华排华，彻底破坏两国关系的借口罢了。
    照会正告印尼政府，不管你们玩弄什么花招，也不管你们捏造、散布多少谎言，都绝对掩盖不了你们残酷迫害无辜华侨的滔天罪行，更逃脱不了你们彻底破坏两国关系的罪责。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨是绝对吓不倒、压不服的。你们对他们所作的种种迫害，只能激起他们更广泛更剧烈的反抗。你们疯狂反华排华，必将受到七亿中国人民的最严厉的惩罚。你们灭绝人性的法西斯暴行必将遭到广大印尼人民的强烈反对和全世界人民的正义谴责，你们是绝对不会有好下场的。
    照会严正要求印尼政府：必须对非法逮捕华侨作出全面交代，立即释放所有被捕华侨，向他们公开道歉，保证不再发生类似事件。在被捕华侨释放前，中国大使馆决定派外交人员前往监狱探望和慰问。印尼政府对此必须迅速作出安排。上述各项要求，你们必须老实照办，否则印度尼西亚政府必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
