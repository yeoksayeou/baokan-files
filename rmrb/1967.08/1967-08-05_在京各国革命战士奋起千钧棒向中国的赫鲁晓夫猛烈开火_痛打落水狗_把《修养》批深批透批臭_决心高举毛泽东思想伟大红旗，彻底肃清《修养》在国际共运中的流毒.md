In the midst of the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the great army of proletarian revolutionaries launches a decisive offensive against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, revolutionary fighters from various countries in Beijing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are criticizing "In Cultivation of the Spirit," a work concocted by the top capitalist roader within the Party, and are sweeping away its poisonous influence in the international communist movement.

Revolutionary fighters from various countries have pointed out that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" is a poisonous weed, an opium pipe that numbs Communist Party members and revolutionary people, and a corrosive agent that undermines the international communist movement. Thoroughly sweeping away the influence of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" in the international communist movement will have a profound impact on further establishing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology and promoting the development of the communist movement.

Revolutionary fighters from various countries have said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" avoids the highest form of class struggle—the use of violence to seize political power—and does not discuss the dictatorship of the proletariat. This fully exposes its use of Marxist-Leninist phrases to conceal its anti-Marxist-Leninist essence and its use of seemingly revolutionary phrases to conceal its counter-revolutionary content. It is a thorough and complete product of revisionism.

"In Cultivation of the Spirit" Avoids International Class Struggle, Is a Thoroughly Counter-Revolutionary Product

Sudanese Osman, in an article criticizing "In Cultivation of the Spirit," said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" is anti-Mao Zedong Thought. In the 1964 revised edition of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" (English version), it does not mention modern revisionism, which has already allied itself with imperialism, nor does it mention the need for a resolute struggle against them. This is a cover-up and diversion of the struggle against the enemies of the people and the communist movement, aiming to make us coexist peacefully with Soviet modern revisionism. This is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary act.

Osman, discussing the tasks of proletarian revolutionaries in the current international situation, said that at present, the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, with the support of Soviet modern revisionism, is carrying out aggression in various parts of the world. The task of all revolutionaries is to overthrow imperialism led by the United States and its accomplices—the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, as well as the reactionaries of various countries. He said that now, all anti-imperialist and national liberation struggles of the people of the world are interconnected. Proletarian revolutionaries should have an internationalist spirit, should wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, should support the national liberation struggles of various countries, and ultimately eliminate class oppression and exploitation, destroy the old world, and build a society without human exploitation. This is the key issue that distinguishes true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries. "In Cultivation of the Spirit" does not answer what revolution is, avoids international class struggle, and advocates a bourgeois worldview that serves a small handful of people. It can only cultivate revisionist elements.

Osman said that to become a revolutionary, to truly serve the interests of the people of the world with all one's heart, we must eliminate all bourgeois ideas from our minds and replace them with proletarian ideas, replace the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview. This is a long-term and arduous process. The great leader of the world proletariat, Chairman Mao, clearly pointed out in his works the path for revolutionaries to serve the people wholeheartedly. Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth, especially the "Three Articles" which guide us in transforming our worldview.

"In Cultivation of the Spirit" also discusses how people should transform themselves, but it advocates "cultivating" oneself behind closed doors. Its counter-revolutionary essence is to make people detach themselves from the masses and isolate themselves from the masses, which is diametrically opposed to Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao taught: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality." "If you want to know the theories and methods of revolution, you must participate in the revolution. All true knowledge comes from direct experience." All revolutionaries should examine their actions according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Osman talked about how he cleared his mind of the poison of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" and said that due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and due to Mao Zedong Thought, he was liberated from the ideological shackles of this book. He knew that it is reasonable to rebel against the revolution, to rebel against the old world, to rebel against the exploiting classes, and to rebel against all obstacles hindering human development.

Osman said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has ushered in a new era of world revolution. It has spread the invincible weapon of the oppressed people of the world—Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. The Cultural Revolution has accelerated the disintegration and demise of imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and the reactionaries of various countries. It has sounded the death knell for them. China will firmly stand in the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the world, and it tightly attracts the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. Let the imperialism led by the United States and the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and the reactionaries of various countries, tremble before the world revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought!

"In Cultivation of the Spirit" Opposes Mao Zedong Thought, Committing a Great Crime Against the World Revolution

Japanese Yamamoto Katsuo said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and it is a poisonous weed. This book, under the cover of the high reputation of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China in the world, spreads poison among revolutionary fighters around the world, and its influence is extremely bad. Chairman Mao taught us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and ghosts, must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." The criticism of this book is not only the task of Chinese comrades but also the common task of revolutionary fighters of the world proletariat.

Yamamoto Katsuo said that at present, American imperialism is frantically pushing its policy of aggression, and Soviet modern revisionism is acting as an accomplice to the United States, sabotaging the revolutionary movements of various countries. In such a fierce international class struggle, "In Cultivation of the Spirit" detaches itself from the reality of class struggle and emphasizes personal cultivation behind closed doors. This is typical idealism and a great crime against the world revolution.

Yamamoto Katsuo said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" attempts to resist the broad revolutionary masses from mastering Mao Zedong Thought and does not mention learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought at all. Yamamoto said that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism. Revolutionary people of the world deeply feel that without Mao Zedong Thought, they lose their direction. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries. The author of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" does not mention learning Mao Zedong Thought, which is another piece of evidence of his resistance to Mao Zedong Thought.

Yamamoto Katsuo said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" uses many beautiful phrases, such as "do not leave class struggle" and "do not leave the struggle of the masses" ... He uses these deceptive words to cover up his personal ambitions. "In Cultivation of the Spirit" also proposes to temper oneself, summarize experience, improve one's ideological level and ability, advance oneself, and become a politically skilled leader, all talking about oneself, all praising individualism, and how to satisfy personal desires. He advocates that the interests of party members and the interests of the party are supposedly consistent, and for the interests of party members, part of the interests of the party can be abandoned. This gives personal interests a legal status and is the philosophical view of revisionism that combines two into one.

Yamamoto Katsuo said that the great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be based on the interests of the people," "Communist Party members, no matter when and where, should not put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people."

Yamamoto Katsuo said that as a communist warrior, in the future, we must have 100% trust in the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought, and we must master Mao Zedong Thought, raise the banner of proletarian internationalism even higher, and throw ourselves into the great waves of class struggle, taking Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as our motto, transforming our worldview in the class struggle, and becoming a revolutionary screw.

Use Mao Zedong Thought as a Weapon to Expose the Reactionary Nature of "In Cultivation of the Spirit"

Sri Lankan Kandasamy said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" has been published in many languages around the world and has had a wide and bad influence. Criticizing this book in the world has great significance. Kandasamy pointed out that this book was first published in China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it did not mention class struggle or national struggle. To talk about "cultivation" without class struggle or national struggle can only cultivate a revisionist.

Kandasamy said that in 1962, the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism entered a tense stage, and "In Cultivation of the Spirit" was reprinted on a large scale. However, the author focused on the struggle against dogmatism, which was obviously colluding with modern revisionism to attack true Marxism-Leninism under the guise of anti-dogmatism.

Kandasamy said that this book advocates slavery, requiring people to obey the leadership of the party, but it does not specifically point out which party and what kind of leadership. This means the author requires people to blindly follow the "leadership of the party," even when it has become a revisionist party, they should still follow. Kandasamy emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Communist Party members should ask why about everything, should think carefully about whether it is in line with reality and whether it is reasonable, and should never blindly follow or advocate slavery." Kandasamy said that we Sri Lankan communists have personal experience. If we blindly follow the leadership of revisionism, Sri Lanka today would not have a true Marxist-Leninist party.

Kandasamy said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" requires party cadres and leaders to completely dissolve their personal interests into the general interests and purposes of the party and the proletariat. Kandasamy pointed out that personal interests are selfish, and the interests of the party are the interests of the advanced class—the proletariat and the broad masses. These are two completely opposite concepts. One is a bourgeois worldview, and the other is a proletarian worldview. The struggle between the two is a fierce and sharp class struggle. In the class struggle, one class wins and the other class is eliminated. They cannot coexist.

Kandasamy said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" also advocates the philosophy of survival, advocating that "under the rule of reactionaries, when necessary, one should abandon party work to preserve comrades." Kandasamy pointed out that those so-called revolutionaries with this philosophy of survival will betray the interests of the party when the revolution encounters difficulties and will not hesitate to sell the party's secrets to preserve their own lives.

Kandasamy pointed out that we use Chairman Mao's teachings to criticize "In Cultivation of the Spirit," and we will see the reactionary and selfish nature of this book. Chairman Mao taught us to have a spirit of "selflessness," "to struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, think of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is to die a worthy death." We firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the only weapon to expose the revisionist fallacies hidden in this book. Using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and refute this book will surely contribute to the world communist movement.

"In Cultivation of the Spirit" Betrays the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Must Thoroughly Eliminate Its Evil Influence

British Hong Ruoshi said that "In Cultivation of the Spirit" is the biggest fake red flag and the most deceptive one. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, I read this book many times and found that it does not discuss the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, does not discuss the dictatorship of the proletariat, and does not discuss violent revolution and armed seizure of political power, these most fundamental issues. It is thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist.

Hong Ruoshi said that exposing and overthrowing China's Khrushchev, criticizing his "In Cultivation of the Spirit," has defended the victory of the Chinese revolution and has also played a huge role in promoting the world revolution. Because the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Chinese revolution are important conditions for the continuous advancement of the international proletarian revolution.

Hong Ruoshi said that the English version of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" was published very early and spread widely in the West. It pretended to be a representative work of the Chinese revolution, deceiving the masses, and limiting the spread of contemporary Marxism-Leninism at the highest level—Mao Zedong Thought among the proletariat in the West. The slavery advocated by "In Cultivation of the Spirit" has greatly poisoned the progressive forces in the West, manifested in their blind following of Khrushchev's revisionism. Some people's revolutionary spirit of rebellion and independent thinking have been suppressed, and some communists put the organizational line in the first place, whatever the instructions of the higher-level party leadership are, they will follow, and put the fate of the party in the hands of a few people. Hong Ruoshi said that we must, like removing a poisonous tumor, thoroughly eliminate the influence of "In Cultivation of the Spirit" in the world proletarian revolutionary movement.

Hong Ruoshi said with confidence that British communists who oppose revisionism must learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution and must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology to establish a true Marxist-Leninist party.

    在京各国革命战士奋起千钧棒向中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火
    痛打落水狗　把《修养》批深批透批臭
    决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底肃清《修养》在国际共运中的流毒
    新华社讯　在浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的时刻，在北京的一些国家的无产阶级革命战士和反帝革命战士，以毛泽东思想为武器，批判中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的《修养》，肃清它在国际共产主义运动中的流毒。
    各国革命战士指出，《修养》是一株大毒草，是麻醉共产党员和革命人民的鸦片烟，是破坏国际共产主义运动的腐蚀剂。彻底肃清《修养》在国际共产主义运动中的影响，对进一步树立以毛泽东思想为指导思想，推动共产主义运动的发展，将产生极为深远的影响。
    各国革命战士说，《修养》回避阶级斗争的最高形式——用暴力夺取政权，不谈无产阶级专政，这就彻底暴露了它以马克思列宁主义的词句，掩盖其反马克思列宁主义的实质，以貌似革命的词句，掩盖其反革命的内容。它是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。
    《修养》回避国际阶级斗争是不折不扣的反革命货色
    苏丹奥斯曼在他写的一篇批判《修养》的文章中说，《修养》是反毛泽东思想的。在一九六四年《修养》（英文版）的修订版中，只字不提已经同帝国主义结盟的现代修正主义，不提和它们作坚决斗争，这是掩饰、转移对人民和共产主义运动的敌人的斗争，是要我们和苏联现代修正主义和平共处，这是不折不扣的反革命。
    奥斯曼在谈到在当前的国际形势下，无产阶级革命者的任务时说，当前，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，正在苏联现代修正主义的支持下，在世界各地进行侵略。所有革命者的任务，就是要打倒以美国为首的帝国主义和它的共谋者——以苏联修正主义统治集团为中心的现代修正主义，以及各国反动派。他说，现在，全世界人民的一切反帝、争取民族解放的斗争都是相互联系的，无产阶级革命者应该有国际主义精神，应该对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行针锋相对的斗争，应该支援各国民族解放斗争，进而消灭阶级压迫和剥削，摧毁旧世界，建立一个没有人剥削人的社会。这是区别真革命和假革命的关键问题。《修养》没有回答什么是革命，避开国际阶级斗争，鼓吹为一小撮人服务的资产阶级世界观，它所培养的只能是修正主义分子。
    奥斯曼说，要成为革命者，要真正全心全意地为世界人民利益服务，我们必须清除头脑中的一切资产阶级思想，代之以无产阶级思想，用无产阶级世界观，取代资产阶级世界观。这是一个长期的、艰苦的过程。世界无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席在他的著作中清楚地指出了革命者应当如何全心全意地为人民服务的道路。毛主席的每一句话都是真理，特别是“老三篇”指引我们改造世界观。
    《修养》也谈到人们如何改造自己，但它鼓吹关起门来“修养”。它的反革命的实质，就是让人们脱离群众，并且孤立于群众之外，这和毛主席的教导是背道而驰的，毛主席教导说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”“你要知道革命的理论和方法，你就得参加革命。一切真知都是从直接经验发源的。”一切革命者都应该按照毛泽东思想检验自己的行动。
    奥斯曼谈到，在苏丹的一部分人当中，把《修养》当成判断共产党员的准则，而世界无产阶级伟大领袖毛主席的著作，被压迫人民的战无不胜的武器毛泽东思想却得不到传播。这些情况决不是偶然的。这说明，一直到不久以前，在那里领导“革命”运动的是苏丹修正主义党，他们不愿意革命，他们知道群众一旦为战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，人民将识破他们的反革命嘴脸，他们将被推翻。
    奥斯曼谈到他自己从思想上肃清《修养》的毒害时说，由于毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，由于毛泽东思想，把我从这本书的思想桎梏中解放出来。我知道了革命造反有理，造旧世界的反，造剥削阶级的反，造阻碍人类发展的各种障碍的反，都是有理。
    奥斯曼说，中国无产阶级文化大革命开始了世界革命的新纪元。它在全世界传播了被压迫人民的战无不胜的武器——马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。文化大革命加速了以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的瓦解和灭亡，敲响了他们的丧钟。中国将坚定地站在反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和各国反动派斗争的前列。毛泽东思想必定会照亮全世界，它紧紧地吸引着全世界革命人民的心。让以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及各国反动派，在以毛泽东思想为指导的世界革命面前发抖吧！
    《修养》反对毛泽东思想对世界革命犯下了大罪
    日本山本胜旷说，《修养》是反马列主义反毛泽东思想的，它是一株大毒草。这本书假借伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党在世界上的崇高的声誉，在世界革命战士中放毒，它所产生的影响是极坏的。毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”对于这本书的批判不仅是中国同志的任务，也是世界无产阶级革命战士的共同任务。
    山本胜旷说，当前美帝国主义疯狂推行侵略政策，苏联现代修正主义充当美国帮凶，破坏各国革命运动。在国际阶级斗争如此激烈的情况下，《修养》这本书脱离现实阶级斗争，强调个人闭门修养，这是典型的唯心论，是对世界革命犯下的大罪。
    山本胜旷说，《修养》企图抵制广大革命群众掌握毛泽东思想，根本不提学习和运用毛泽东思想。山本说，毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大思想武器，世界革命人民深深体会到离开了毛泽东思想就失去了方向。对待毛泽东思想的态度，是真革命和假革命的分水岭。《修养》的作者不提学习毛泽东思想，是他抵制毛泽东思想的又一罪证。
    山本胜旷说，《修养》中使用了很多漂亮的词句，如“不要离开阶级斗争”，“不要离开人民大众的斗争”……。他用这些骗人的鬼话，掩盖他个人的野心。《修养》中还提出，锻炼自己，总结经验，加强自己思想水平和能力，提高自己，使自己进步，使自己成为政治上熟练的领导，说的都是自己，都是歌颂个人主义，是要人怎样满足个人主义欲望。他宣扬党员个人利益和党的利益的所谓一致，为了党员个人利益可以放弃部分党的利益。这就给个人利益以合法的地位，是修正主义合二而一的哲学观点。
    山本胜旷说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发”，“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”
    山本胜旷说，作为一个共产主义战士，今后我们要百分之百的信任当代最高水平的马列主义——毛泽东思想，要把毛泽东思想学到手，更高地举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，投入阶级斗争的大风大浪中去，以毛主席的“老三篇”作为座右铭，在阶级斗争中改造世界观，作一个革命的螺丝钉。
    用毛泽东思想作武器揭穿《修养》反动本质
    锡兰康德萨密说，《修养》曾用多种文字在世界发行，流毒很广，影响很坏。在世界范围内批判这本书，是有重大意义的。康德萨密指出，这本书是在中国抗日战争中第一次出版的，但它既没有提到阶级斗争，又没有提到民族斗争。离开阶级斗争或民族斗争而去谈什么“修养”，只能培养成一个修正主义者。
    康德萨密说，一九六二年马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的斗争进入一个紧张阶段，《修养》又大规模再次出版，但是，作者把重点放在反教条主义的斗争上，这显然是和现代修正主义勾结起来，以反教条主义为名来攻击真正的马克思列宁主义。
    康德萨密说，这本书鼓吹奴隶主义，作者要求人们服从党的领导，但是他没有具体指出什么党和什么样的领导。这就是说作者要求人们盲目跟着“党的领导”走，甚至当它已经变成修正主义党时，他们也应该跟着走。康德萨密强调指出，毛泽东同志教导我们：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”康德萨密说，我们锡兰共产党人有切身的体会，如果我们盲目跟从修正主义领导，锡兰今天就不会有真正的马克思列宁主义党。
    康德萨密说，《修养》中要党的干部和党的领导人，把他们个人的利益完全溶化在党和无产阶级的一般利益和目的之中。康德萨密指出，个人利益是自私的，党的利益是先进阶级——无产阶级和广大群众的利益。这是两个彼此完全对立的概念。一个是资产阶级世界观，一个是无产阶级世界观，两者之间的斗争是严酷的、尖锐的阶级斗争。在阶级斗争中，一个阶级胜利了，另一个阶级被消灭，他们不能共存。
    康德萨密说，《修养》还大肆宣扬活命哲学，宣扬“在反动统治的环境下，在必要时还要放弃党的工作来保存同志。”康德萨密指出，有这种活命哲学观点的所谓革命者，在革命遇到困难时期，就会违背党的利益而变成叛徒。他们就会毫不迟疑地为了保存自己的生命出卖党的秘密。
    康德萨密指出，我们以毛主席教导批判《修养》，我们就会看清楚这本书的反动的、利己主义的本质。毛主席教导我们要有“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我们深信，毛泽东思想是发现隐藏在这本书中的修正主义谬论的唯一武器，用毛泽东思想批判和驳斥这本书，就一定会对世界共产主义运动作出贡献。
    《修养》背叛无产阶级专政必须彻底肃清其恶劣影响
    英国洪若诗说，《修养》是假红旗中最大的一面，也是欺骗性最大的一面。中国无产阶级文化大革命开展后，我多次再读这本书，发现这本书不谈无产阶级向资产阶级进行斗争，不谈无产阶级专政，不谈暴力革命和武装夺取政权这些最根本问题。它是彻头彻尾的反马克思列宁主义的。
    洪若诗说，揭发、斗倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，批臭他的《修养》，保卫了中国革命的胜利，同时对世界革命也起了巨大的推动作用。因为战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国革命的胜利发展，是国际无产阶级革命不断前进的重要条件。
    洪若诗说，《修养》的英文版出得很早，在西方流传很广，它冒充中国革命的代表著作，欺骗群众，限制了当代最高水平的马列主义——毛泽东思想在西方无产阶级中的传播。《修养》宣扬的奴隶主义对西方的进步力量毒害很大，表现在他们对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的盲从。一些人的革命造反精神、独立思考精神被压下去，一些共产党人把组织路线放在首位，凡是上级党领导的指示就照办，把党的命运放在少数人手里。洪若诗说，我们必须象清除毒瘤一样，在全世界无产阶级革命运动中彻底肃清《修养》的影响。
    洪若诗充满信心地说，英国的反对修正主义的共产主义战士要建立起真正的马列主义政党，就必须从中国革命中吸取经验，必须以毛泽东思想为指导思想。
