Under the pretext of "beneficial and harmless," the top capitalist-roader in the Party vigorously advocates the "beneficial and harmless" theory. He proclaims: "We should follow the principle of being beneficial and harmless and easily sellable to print a large number of old books." He also says: "If watching a play can make people rest and be happy, that is very good." The counter-revolutionary revisionist head of the literary and artistic circle, Zhou Yang, blathers on about how "what is harmless is politically harmless, but beneficial to life." The capitalist-roader in the music circle also joins in, shouting: "It is difficult to distinguish between the active and the harmless; the harmless and cheerful can also be introduced to the masses to listen to."

This is sheer daydreaming. In a class society, how can there be a "life" that is above class and politics? Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are a definite political line." Literature and art either serve the politics of the proletariat or the politics of the bourgeoisie. Those who advocate classless literature and art are actually advocating bourgeois literature and art.

Zhou Yang and his ilk have their words and actions. Under the black flag of the "beneficial and harmless" theory, they vigorously promote light music and social dances in the music circle, enthusiastically praising programs that supposedly have nothing to do with politics but are beneficial to "entertainment" and "rest," such as those describing love, flowers, snow, and moon, and dancing and joy. They even claim that this is "in line with the demands of the masses" and that "dance parties are very important and are a very common form of mass activity." The top capitalist-roader in the Party shamelessly says: "Dancing is a very normal activity and should provide young men and women with opportunities to meet publicly and have social interactions," and so on. Thus, light music and social dances have become living examples of the "beneficial and harmless" theory.

What kind of goods are the living examples of the "beneficial and harmless" theory advocated by Zhou Yang and his ilk?

The so-called classless "love" and "natural" light music they promote are all rotten goods that advocate the bourgeois decayed outlook on life and way of living. What are things like "The Flowers and the Youth," "Evening Waltz," "Summer Night Waltz," and so on? They all describe nothing more than "beautiful eyes that speak," "nothing is more beautiful than youth," and so on, all of which express the bourgeois love supreme and enjoy the moment to the fullest, thoroughly rotten things. Even more sinister is that under the guise of recommending Afro-Asian songs, they have elevated things like "The Dove," "Baby," and "Oh, Mommy" to the heavens. These songs sing about things like "without your love, I will die," "merchants sailing on the beautiful river," and so on, all of which are reactionary yellow music from colonial and semi-colonial countries, music that saps people's revolutionary will. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, however, shamelessly say that singing these songs is "supporting the revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." This is a malicious slander against the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

Under the cover of the "beneficial and harmless" theory, Zhou Yang and his ilk deliberately pick up these rotten goods to poison the masses and corrupt the youth. Some people are "charmed" by these "beautiful and lively" songs, listless all day; some become "dance addicts," not seeking progress in politics but indulging in the bourgeois way of life. Some are even captured by the bourgeoisie. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party use soft knives to kill people in this way.

The so-called "beneficial and harmless" theory, which is harmless to "politics" but beneficial to "personal life," "rest," and "entertainment," is all lies. Their so-called "personal life" is itself bourgeois politics. The "San Jia Village" anti-Party clique's Liao Mushu said: "Leisure time is the first broad field for the free play of interests," which exactly exposes the true face of the "personal life" advocated by Zhou Yang and other counter-revolutionary revisionists. They pretend to be human during the day, but once they return to "San Jia Village," they take off their Communist Party member's coat, and their "first interest" in their "leisure time" is shamelessly exposed. As Comrade Yao Wenyuan said: "Except for plotting and scheming to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, they indulge in eating, drinking, playing, talking about cats and dogs, praising landlords, playing with antiques, playing mahjong, doing business, pursuing the set of Soviet revisionist intellectuals... They can do all kinds of rotten things. They are two-faced and hypocrites." The handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party are exactly such hypocrites and two-faced people. They advocate "beneficial and harmless" works precisely to fill their rotten and empty souls. Moreover, they want to use these rotten and decadent things to corrupt the masses, making people unknowingly and comfortably undergo a peaceful evolution.

The "beneficial and harmless" theory, which wears the cloak of being above class and politics, is an important part of the "all-people's literature and art" theory. Its harm to the masses is more concealed and misleading than some nakedly reactionary theories. However, in the face of the revolutionary masses who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the mask of the "beneficial and harmless" theory has finally been torn off. We must throw the "beneficial and harmless" theory along with the Chinese Khrushchev who advocates this fallacy into the garbage dump, making it never able to rise again!

### 在“有益无害”的幌子下

    在“有益无害”的幌子下
    中国革命音协全体革命同志
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派极力鼓吹“有益无害”论。他宣扬：“要根据有益无害、销得掉的原则，大量印旧书。”又说：“看了戏，能使人休息，使人高兴，就很好。”文艺界的反革命修正主义头目周扬胡说什么：“所谓无害，就是政治上没有害处，而在生活上还有点益处。”音乐界党内走资本主义道路的当权派也跟着叫嚷：“积极和无害很难分，无害的、情调欢乐的也可以介绍给群众听。”
    这真是白日说梦话。在有阶级的社会中，怎么会有超脱于阶级和政治之上的“生活”呢？毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”文艺不是为无产阶级的政治服务，就是为资产阶级的政治服务，那些主张超阶级的文艺，实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺。
    周扬等人有其言，也有其行。他们在音乐界打着“有益无害”论这面黑旗，大力提倡轻音乐及交谊舞会，大肆吹捧那些描写爱情、风花雪月、跳舞欢乐等所谓“与政治无关”而有益于“娱乐”和“休息”的节目。他们居然说这是“符合群众的要求”，“舞会是很重要的，是很普遍的群众活动形式”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派也恬不知耻地说：“跳舞是个很正常的活动，应该给青年男女公开会面的机会，有一个社交的机会”，等等。就这样，轻音乐和交谊舞会竟成了“有益无害”论的活标本。
    周扬等人提倡的“有益无害”论的活标本究竟是些什么货色呢？
    他们鼓吹的所谓超阶级的“爱情”、“自然”的轻音乐，都是宣扬资产阶级腐朽的人生观及其生活方式的破烂货。什么《花儿与少年》、《晚会圆舞曲》、《夏夜圆舞曲》等等，描写的都不外是什么“美丽的眼睛会说话”，“人中间美不过少年”等等表现资产阶级爱情至上，及时行乐的腐朽透顶的东西。更恶毒的是他们在推荐亚非拉歌曲的幌子下，把什么《鸽子》、《宝贝》、《哎哟，妈妈》等等捧上了天。这些歌唱的是什么“没有你的爱情我会死去”呀，什么“商人们乘船远航在美丽的河面上”呀，完全是殖民地半殖民地的反动黄色音乐，消磨人们革命意志的靡靡之音，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却胡说演唱这些歌是“支援亚非拉人民的革命斗争”，这是对亚非拉人民的恶毒污蔑！
    周扬之流在“有益无害”论的掩盖下，处心积虑地捡来这些破烂货，毒害群众，腐蚀青年。有人被这些“优美动听、轻快活泼”的歌曲所“陶醉”，整天委靡不振；有人成了“舞迷”，政治上不求进步，却醉心于资产阶级的生活方式。还有些人甚至被资产阶级俘虏了过去。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就是这样用软刀子来杀人的。
    “有益无害”论所谓的无害于“政治”而有益于“个人生活”、“休息”、“娱乐”，全是假话。他们所谓的“个人生活”，本身就是资产阶级的政治。“三家村”反党集团中的廖沫沙说过：“业余时间是第一兴趣广泛驰骋的自由天地”，这句话正好暴露了周扬等反革命修正主义分子所讲的“个人生活”的真实面目。他们平时装装人样，一回到“三家村”，脱下共产党员的外衣，他们“业余时间”的“第一兴趣”就放肆地暴露出来了。正如姚文元同志说的：“除了密谋策划进行反党反社会主义活动外，吃喝玩乐，谈猫吹狗，捧地主，玩古董，打麻将，做买卖，追求苏联修正主义知识分子的一套……什么腐烂的事都干得出来。这是两面派，伪君子。”党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派正是这样的伪君子、两面派。他们提倡“有益无害”的作品，正是为了填补他们腐朽空虚的灵魂。不仅如此，他们还想用这些腐朽糜烂的东西来腐蚀群众，使人在不知不觉之中，舒舒服服地和平演变过去。
    披着超阶级、超政治的外衣的“有益无害”论，是“全民文艺”论的重要内容之一，它对群众的毒害作用，比某些露骨的反动理论来得更隐蔽、更带有迷惑性。但是在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命群众面前，“有益无害”论的画皮终于被剥开了。我们要把“有益无害”论连同鼓吹这种谬论的中国赫鲁晓夫一起扔进垃圾堆，让它永世不得翻身！
