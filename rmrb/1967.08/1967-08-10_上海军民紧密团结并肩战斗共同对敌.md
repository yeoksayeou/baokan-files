Raise High the Great Banner of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People"
Shanghai Military and Civilians United in Close Combat Against the Enemy

Determined to thoroughly expose, criticize, and defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the high tide of revolutionary criticism, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the PLA garrison in Shanghai and the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have, in their joint struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, launched a more extensive, broader, and deeper wave of "supporting the army and loving the people."

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison and the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have, in the storm of the "January Revolution," breathed together, shared the same fate, fought side by side, and opposed the enemy together, forging a deep bond of combat friendship. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Liberation Army, from the city to the districts, counties, and grassroots factories, schools, and offices, military and civilian units jointly held grand meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, exchanging experiences in "supporting the army and loving the people." In these activities, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army, which was personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, for its great achievements in liberating and defending the motherland and its new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They shared their experiences in "supporting the army" and "learning from the army." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison army, navy, and air force, adhering to the spirit of "correcting mistakes for the people's benefit and persisting in what is good for the people," thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed their "three supports, two militaries" work, and shared their experiences in "supporting the left," "loving the left," and "learning from the left." The military and civilian units jointly made a solemn vow: They would definitely raise the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" higher, strengthen military-civilian unity, handle military-civilian relations well, foil all the tricks of the class enemy, and in the new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose, criticize, and defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in politics, ideology, and theory. They would strive to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and build Shanghai into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line closely binds the military and the people together.

In the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison and the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have come to a deeper understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people." The leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, at the meeting commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the PLA, on behalf of the revolutionary masses of the entire city, proposed: "Supporting the army" means supporting the dictatorship of the proletariat and supporting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Firmly supporting the PLA's "three supports, two militaries" work means following Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking and resolutely carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The leaders of the Shanghai garrison army, navy, and air force also, on behalf of the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, most firmly declared: "Loving the people" means loving Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the utmost, being loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the utmost, and being loyal to the great cause of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We vow to be the strong pillar of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionaries!

"Supporting the army and loving the people" is Chairman Mao's consistent brilliant idea. The key to implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction of "supporting the army and loving the people" lies in the military and civilian units being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The representatives attending the experience exchange meeting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works by the "three supports, two militaries" personnel of the Shanghai Garrison District, with a large number of facts, explained: In the "three supports, two militaries" work, being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can distinguish between the enemy and us, distinguish between the revolutionaries and the conservatives, firmly stand on the side of the leftists, and wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly support the leftists, making the "loving the people" work better and better. The leaders of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, which has two million soldiers, deeply felt that the attitude towards the PLA is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat and the attitude towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Therefore, they love the PLA immensely, trust the PLA completely, learn from the PLA seriously, rely on the PLA actively, and enthusiastically help the PLA overcome some shortcomings and errors that inevitably arise in the "three supports, two militaries" work, making the "supporting the army" work more outstanding.

Sincerely learning from each other is an important content of "supporting the army and loving the people."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." The personnel of the Shanghai garrison participating in the "three supports, two militaries" work, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, regard the "three supports, two militaries" as the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and learning from the broad masses of leftists. They proposed, "Loving the people" means "supporting the left," "supporting the left" must "love the left," and "loving the left" must "learn from the left." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the naval propaganda teams of the East China Fleet stationed in Shanghai Xianfeng Electric Machine Factory and Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard, in their joint struggle with the proletarian revolutionaries, deeply felt that the broad revolutionary masses follow Chairman Mao the closest and are always their teachers. Therefore, they consciously and respectfully, honestly, and humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionaries and often compare and check themselves with the proletarian revolutionaries' positions, feelings, and styles, combining the "three supports, two militaries" with the construction of the army, and promoting the revolutionary and combat-ready construction of the army through the "three supports, two militaries."

The proletarian revolutionaries in the Shanghai area deeply feel that without the strong support of the PLA, there would be no great victory of the "January Revolution," no great victory of "grasp revolution, promote production," and no good situation of the Shanghai Cultural Revolution today. The PLA, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has formed a glorious revolutionary tradition, excellent style, and a set of experiences with politics in command through 40 years of heroic struggle, which is the most precious treasure of the proletariat. Learning this set of precious treasures is a matter of great importance for the revolutionary construction of factories, rural areas, offices, and schools for a hundred years. The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai Xianfeng Electric Machine Factory, Shanghai Port Bureau's Third Loading and Unloading Area, and Nanhui County Laogang Commune's Donggang Brigade, who have done an excellent job in "grasp revolution, promote production," in sharing their experiences of learning from the PLA, all used a large number of vivid and moving examples to enthusiastically praise the PLA's experience, which is effective wherever it is applied. They are determined to make learning from the PLA an important content of supporting the army, so that the PLA's excellent traditions can bloom and bear fruit in factories and rural areas and be passed down from generation to generation.

Looking at the main trend and the overall direction is the key to doing a good job in "supporting the army and loving the people."

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison, in the practice of "three supports, two militaries" work, deeply felt that the key to doing a good job in "loving the people" lies in correctly treating the masses. Correctly treating the masses, first of all, is to correctly treat the proletarian revolutionaries and look at their overall direction and main trend. The officers and soldiers pointed out that the proletarian revolutionaries, in this great proletarian cultural revolution that relates to the fate of the country and the world, have a firm stance, clear banners, and firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, making a big fuss about the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Their overall direction is correct, their main trend is good, and their achievements are the greatest. We must firmly support them and love them dearly. As for their shortcomings in the process of advancement, we must not adopt a mocking and blaming attitude, but must learn Mao Zedong Thought together with them in the struggle, help them summarize experiences, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and keep moving forward.

The officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison also believe that to handle military-civilian relations well, the army must, from the interests of the Party and the needs of the struggle between the two lines, discard selfish thoughts, dare to admit mistakes, bravely correct them, and do so resolutely, actively, quickly, and thoroughly. They must not be hesitant or ashamed.

The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai, in the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have a particularly deep understanding of Chairman Mao's great teaching that "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." They will never forget that at the critical moment of the power struggle, the PLA firmly and enthusiastically "supported the left," greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionaries and greatly demoralizing the reactionaries; in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary economic wind, the PLA fought day and night on the docks and ports, creating countless moving heroic deeds. They will never forget that the PLA, like parents, helped the revolutionary mass organizations' leaders to hold power well and use power well; the PLA went to factories, schools, and fields to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Many representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries, when talking about the PLA's combat friendship of sharing the same breath, fate, and blood, with tears in their eyes, said: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, and nothing is as good as the people's army." No matter what storms and waves appear, our belief in "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army" will never change!

Launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and strengthen military-civilian unity a thousand times over.

"The remaining courage should be used to pursue the fleeing enemy, and it is not advisable to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Shanghai garrison and the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries believe: The military and civilian units must closely unite and fight side by side, following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is the best practical action of "supporting the army and loving the people." At present, we must raise the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" higher, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, wage a "people's war," and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in various regions, thoroughly exposing, criticizing, and defeating them in politics, ideology, and theory, so that they can never rise again!

    更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜
    上海军民紧密团结并肩战斗共同对敌
    决心在革命大批判的高潮中，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批透、批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    据新华社上海电　中国人民解放军驻沪部队广大指战员和上海广大革命群众，在共同向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在军内代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿展开的大揭发、大批判、大斗争中，掀起了一个更大更广泛更深入的“拥军爱民”的热潮。
    驻沪部队广大指战员和上海的广大革命群众，在“一月革命”风暴中，同呼吸、共命运，并肩战斗，共同对敌，结下了牢固的战斗友谊。在纪念伟大的中国人民解放军建军四十周年的日子里，从市到各区、县、基层工厂、学校、机关，军民都共同举行了盛大的以军爱民、民拥军为内容的活学活用毛主席著作讲用会、座谈会，畅谈“拥军爱民”的伟大意义，交流“拥军爱民”工作的经验。在这些活动中，上海无产阶级革命派热烈赞颂毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，在解放祖国、保卫祖国的战斗中建立的丰功伟绩，在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的新的功劳，畅谈了自己“拥军”、“学军”的经验。战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的驻沪陆海空军广大指战员，本着“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的精神，认真地、全面地检查了“三支”、“两军”工作，畅谈了自己“支左”、“爱左”、“学左”的经验。军民共同发出豪迈的誓言：一定要更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，把军民团结搞得牢牢的，把军民关系处理得好好的，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，在革命大批判的新高潮中，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批透、批臭，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，为把上海建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校而努力奋斗。
    毛主席的革命路线把军民紧紧联系在一起
    在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争实践中，驻沪部队广大指战员和上海的广大革命群众，更加深刻地认识到伟大统帅毛主席提出的“拥军爱民”号召的伟大意义。上海市革命委员会领导成员，在纪念“八一”建军节四十周年的大会上，代表全市广大革命群众提出：“拥军”，就是拥护无产阶级专政，就是拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。坚决支持人民解放军的“三支”、“两军”工作，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略思想，就是决心按照毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。驻沪陆海空军负责人也代表广大指战员最坚定地表示：“爱民”，就是无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是忠于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大事业。我们誓做上海市革命委员会的坚强支柱，誓做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾！
      “拥军爱民”是毛主席一贯的光辉思想。贯彻执行毛主席“拥军爱民”伟大指示的关键，在于军民无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。参加上海警备区举行的“三支”、“两军”人员活学活用毛主席著作经验交流会的代表，以大量的事实说明：在“三支”“两军”工作中，忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，就能分清敌我界限，分清“革”与“保”的界限，坚决向左派一边倒，全心全意、毫不含糊地支持左派，把“爱民”工作做得好上加好。拥有二百万战士的上海工人革命造反总司令部的领导成员深有体会地指出，对待解放军的态度，就是对待无产阶级专政的态度，就是对待以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的态度。因此，他们无比地热爱解放军，充分地信赖解放军，认真地学习解放军，主动地依靠解放军，热情地帮助解放军克服在“三支”、“两军”中难免产生的一些缺点错误，使“拥军”工作越做越出色。
    真诚地相互学习，是“拥军爱民”的重要内容
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”驻沪部队参加“三支”、“两军”工作的人员，牢记毛主席的教导，把“三支”、“两军”看成是活学活用毛主席著作和向左派广大群众学习的最好课堂。他们提出，“爱民”就要“支左”，“支左”必须
  “爱左”，“爱左”必须“学左”。海军东海舰队驻上海先锋电机厂、上海东方红造船厂的毛泽东思想宣传队广大指战员，在与无产阶级革命派并肩战斗中，深深感到广大革命群众跟毛主席跟得最紧，永远是自己的先生，因而，自觉地恭恭敬敬、老老实实向无产阶级革命派学习，并且经常以无产阶级革命派的立场、感情、作风对比检查自己，把“三支”、“两军”与部队建设结合起来，通过“三支”、“两军”促进部队的革命化、战斗化建设。
    上海地区的无产阶级革命派深深体会到：没有解放军的大力支持，就没有“一月革命”的伟大胜利，就没有“抓革命，促生产”的伟大胜利，就没有今天上海文化大革命的大好形势。人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在四十年英勇奋斗中形成的光荣革命传统、优良作风和突出政治的一整套经验，是无产阶级最宝贵的财富。把这套宝贵财富学到手，是关系到工厂、农村、机关、学校革命化建设的百年大计。抓革命、促生产搞得十分出色的上海先锋电机厂、上海港务局第三装卸区和南汇县老港公社港东大队等单位的无产阶级革命派，在畅谈向解放军学习的体会时，都以大量生动感人的事例，热情赞颂解放军的经验用到那里那里灵，决心把向解放军学习作为拥军的重要内容，让解放军的优良传统在工厂、农村开花结果，代代相传。
      相互看主流、看大方向，是搞好“拥军爱民”的关键
    驻沪部队广大指战员在“三支”、“两军”工作实践中，深深体会到，做好“爱民”工作的关键，在于正确对待群众。正确对待群众，首先就是要正确对待无产阶级革命派，看他们的大方向和主流。指战员们指出，无产阶级革命派，在这场关系到国家命运和世界命运的无产阶级文化大革命中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，他们的大方向就是正确，他们的主流就是好，他们的成绩是最大最大的。我们就是要坚决支持他们，无比热爱他们。对于他们在前进过程中的缺点，决不能采取嘲笑、指责的态度，就是要与他们在斗争中共同学习毛泽东思想，帮助他们总结经验，发扬成绩，克服缺点，不断前进。
    驻沪部队指战员还认为，要处理好军民关系，部队对“支左”工作中的一些缺点、错误，必须从党的利益出发，从两条路线斗争的需要出发，抛掉私心杂念，敢于承认，勇于改正，做到坚决改，主动改，快改，彻底改，决不能吞吞吐吐，羞羞答答。
    上海的无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，对于毛主席的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”这一伟大教导，体会特别深刻。他们永远不会忘记，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，解放军坚决、热情地“支左”，大长了革命派的志气，大灭了反动派的威风；在反击反革命经济主义妖风的斗争中，解放军通宵达旦战斗在码头、港口，创造了无数动人的英雄事迹。他们永远不会忘记，解放军亲如手足地帮助革命群众组织负责人掌好权、用好权；解放军下工厂、进学校、上田头热情宣传毛泽东思想。许多无产阶级革命派代表谈到解放军与他们同呼吸、共命运，血肉相联的战斗友情时，热泪盈眶地说：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如人民军队好。无论出现什么惊涛骇浪，我们“相信和依靠人民解放军”的信念永不变！
    掀起革命大批判的新高潮，千百倍巩固和加强军民团结
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”驻沪部队广大指战员和上海无产阶级革命派认为：军民紧紧地团结在一起，并肩战斗，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，这是“拥军爱民”最好的实际行动。当前，要更高地举起“拥军爱民”的旗帜，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，打一场“人民战争”，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在各地区代理人统统揪出来，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深，批透，批倒，批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！
