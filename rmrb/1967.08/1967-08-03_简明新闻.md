New Zealanders Protest Against Taylor's "Visit"

New Zealanders have been holding continuous protests against the arrival of Johnson's "emissary" Taylor and "advisor" Clifford in New Zealand, who are seeking recruits for the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam. On the evening of July 31, when Taylor and his entourage arrived at Wellington Airport, over a hundred people braved heavy rain to protest at the airport. The protesters chanted slogans such as "Taylor, go back!" Young people hung large banners on buildings in Wellington, reading "No New Zealand youth will fight in the dirty war of American aggression in Vietnam!" On August 1, more than two thousand angry New Zealanders held a protest demonstration at Parliament Square.

Argentine Working-Class Children Unable to Attend Primary School

According to recent statistics from the Argentine Ministry of Education, the dropout rate for primary school students in Argentina has reached 59.3%. For example, in 1959, there were 683,000 first-grade students. By the time they reached the sixth grade, only 270,000 remained, with 400,000 having dropped out. These children drop out mainly because, under brutal exploitation, the broad masses of working people are impoverished and have to send their children to work to ease economic hardships. In capitalist society, the so-called "compulsory education" is merely an empty promise.

West German Coal Industry in Severe Crisis Amidst Foreign Competition

In the shadow of the economic crisis, the coal industry in West Germany is particularly severe due to intense competition from foreign monopolies. In the first half of this year, West Germany's hard coal production decreased by about 10% (55 million tons) compared to the same period last year. Currently, the number of coal miners employed has dropped to 260,000, less than half of the number in 1957.

The main cause of the sales crisis in the West German coal industry is the aggressive competition from U.S., British, and Dutch oil trusts in the West German energy market. The West German government, in order to protect the interests of coal industry capitalists, has intensified the closure of mines, mass layoffs of workers, and implemented austerity measures by cutting into the livelihoods of the working people.

U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists Compete to Aid Indian Reactionaries in Military Expansion

The "aid India consortium" controlled by the U.S. imperialists recently decided to provide the Indian reactionary government with $128 million in "aid." The Indian reactionary government plans to increase its army to 31 divisions and expand its navy and air force, improving military equipment.

The Soviet revisionists have decided to provide the Indian reactionary government with more naval equipment in the near future, including submarines, patrol boats, and motor torpedo boats. Indian naval personnel who will serve on these vessels have already received training at Soviet naval bases in Crimea and the Black Sea.

The Indian reactionaries have recently obtained approximately 400 T-54 and T-55 tanks from some Eastern European countries.

    新西兰人民示威反对泰勒“访问”
    新西兰人民连续示威，抗议约翰逊的“特使”泰勒和“顾问”克利福德到新西兰活动，为美帝侵越战争搜罗炮灰。七月三十一日晚，当泰勒等到达惠灵顿机场时，有一百多人冒着倾盆大雨在机场举行示威，示威者高呼口号：“泰勒滚回去！”青年们在惠灵顿一些建筑物上高悬大幅标语：“不会有新西兰的青年肯为美国侵略越南的肮脏的战争去卖命！”等。八月一日，两千多名愤怒的新西兰人在议会广场举行抗议示威。
    阿根廷劳动人民子弟读不起小学
    据阿根廷文化教育国务部教育统计局最近提出的材料，阿根廷小学生失学率达到百分之五十九点三。例如一九五九年进入小学的一年级学生有六十八万三千多人。而到六年级毕业时只有二十七万多人，失学人数高达四十万人。这些儿童失学主要因为在残酷压榨下，广大劳动人民贫困不堪，他们为了生存不得不把孩子送去工作以减轻经济困难。在资本主义社会中，实行所谓“义务教育”，实际上只是一句空话。
    西德煤业在美英排挤下危机严重
    在危机阴影笼罩下的整个西德经济中，采煤业在外国垄断资本的剧烈竞争下，情况显得分外严重。今年上半年西德硬煤产量比去年同期下降约百分之十（五百五十万吨）。目前煤矿工人就业人数减低到二十六万人，还不到一九五七年矿工人数的一半。
    西德煤业的销售危机的主要原因来自于美、英、荷兰等石油康采恩在西德动力市场上对西德煤的排挤。西德政府为了保护采煤业资本家的利益，变本加厉地关闭矿井、大批解雇工人，并且用向劳动人民开刀的办法来紧缩生产。
    美帝苏修争相帮助印度反动派扩军
    由美帝操纵的“援印财团”不久以前决定给予印度反动政府十二亿八千万美元的“援助”。印度反动政府计划把陆军增加到三十一个师，并且扩大海空军，改进军事装备。
    苏修决定在最近期间给印度反动政府更多的海军装备，其中包括潜艇、巡逻艇和摩托鱼雷艇。在这些舰艇上服役的印度海军人员，已经在克里米亚和黑海的苏联海军基地接受了训练。
    印度反动派最近又从东欧一些国家得到了大约四百辆T—54和T—55型坦克。
