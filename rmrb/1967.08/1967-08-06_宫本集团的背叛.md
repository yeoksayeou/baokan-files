Recently, the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) made a statement to the bourgeois press, announcing the recall of the JCP's representative in China, Sunama Ichiro, and the *Akahata* newspaper's correspondent in Beijing, Konno Junichi. They shamelessly spread the lie that the Chinese side "took various measures" to "intensify pressure" and "persecute" Sunama and Konno. This is another anti-China incident they have deliberately manufactured in collusion with U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionary Sato government.

We had long anticipated that the Miyamoto revisionist group and certain individuals with ulterior motives would use the issue of Sunama Ichiro's stay in China to write anti-China articles. To fully expose their anti-China ugly face, to strip off their pretexts on this issue, and to let the Japanese people clearly see the counter-revolutionary revisionist face of the Miyamoto group, we did not take the step of expelling Sunama. Despite the fact that Sunama and Konno engaged in anti-China activities in China, we still treated them with the courtesy due to guests in China.

We have seen that on the issue of Sunama's stay in China, certain individuals with ulterior motives, appearing in a "leftist" guise, attacked our party for not expelling Sunama. They attempted to provoke us to create anti-China capital for the Miyamoto group. We saw through their intentions and did not pay attention. We wanted to let the Miyamoto group perform, to see what tricks they would play on this issue.

Now, the Miyamoto group has indeed used the recall of Sunama and Konno as an anti-China card, once again acting in concert with all anti-China heroes, seeking rewards from U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries.

The Miyamoto revisionist leadership's creation of this anti-China incident is not accidental. For a long time, they have acted as a pathetic trumpeter in the anti-China chorus of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. The Miyamoto revisionist press has published countless anti-China articles. Miyamoto and Nosaka have personally delivered anti-China speeches. They have viciously slandered and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, slandered and attacked the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, slandered and attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought, and slandered and attacked the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China.

To oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. To oppose China, one must inevitably capitulate to the United States. This is a truth proven by countless facts in contemporary international political life. Whoever opposes U.S. imperialism cannot but oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership that serves U.S. imperialism. Whoever opposes socialist China, which firmly upholds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely supports the world revolution, will inevitably capitulate to U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, Soviet revisionism. The evolution of the Miyamoto group in recent years once again proves this truth.

The Miyamoto group repeatedly claims to oppose U.S. imperialism. Then why do you collude with Soviet revisionism to sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle of revolutionary peoples internationally and within Japan? Why do you also strive to hype up the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, as an anti-imperialist force? In short, you are afraid of U.S. imperialism, afraid of Soviet revisionism, afraid of war, and afraid of revolution. Your opposition to the United States is false; what you truly do is cover for Soviet revisionism's capitulation to U.S. imperialism, and thus also cover for your own capitulation to U.S. imperialism.

The Miyamoto group repeatedly claims to engage in some "united action" to oppose the United States and aid Vietnam. Then why do you fiercely attack socialist China, which resolutely opposes U.S. imperialism and fully supports the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation? U.S. imperialism opposes China, Soviet revisionism opposes China, the Sato government opposes China, and the reactionaries of India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries oppose China. What is the difference between your opposition to China and theirs? There is no difference; you are all of the same ilk. The "united action" you advocate is the "united action" of all the ghosts and snakes internationally to oppose China, oppose communism, oppose the people, and oppose revolution.

The Miyamoto group repeatedly claims to be "independent and self-reliant," opposing "subservience." Then why do you openly defend the Soviet revisionist leadership as their echo? Why do you follow the line of "peaceful transition" that Soviet revisionism promotes? Why do you use the same clichés as Soviet revisionism when attacking and slandering the Communist Party of China? What kind of "independence and self-reliance" is this! You are genuine subservients. You are subservient to the "great" Soviet revisionism. Your headquarters is merely a branch office of Soviet revisionism in Japan.

The Miyamoto group repeatedly claims to oppose China's "great power chauvinism," saying that the Communist Party of China wants to impose its line on them. What a joke! Do we still not know what you are? How can we imagine that we would impose Marxism-Leninism on you, a bunch of revisionists? In reality, you are trying every means to force us to agree with your revisionist views, repeatedly asking us to join you in some "united action" with Soviet revisionism. We insist on the Marxist-Leninist principle and oppose your revisionist goods. Is this "imposing on others"? Is this "great power chauvinism"? Only those who try to impose their revisionism on others and fail to achieve their goal would slander the Communist Party of China's Marxist-Leninist stance as "imposing on others" and "great power chauvinism."

The Miyamoto group repeatedly claims to "inherit and develop" the tradition of the Japanese Communist Party opposing Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. The Japanese Communist Party indeed has the glorious tradition of opposing Japanese imperialism's aggression against China, but it has never had the tradition of aiding Japanese imperialism in opposing China. Now, you are participating in the anti-China ranks of the Sato government under the banner of the Communist Party, which is a new "creation." You have betrayed the internationalist revolutionary tradition of the Japanese Communist Party and inherited the anti-China tradition of Japanese militarism.

The Miyamoto group's frenzied opposition to China completely goes against the will and wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people. They are willing to act as the anti-China lackeys of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Sato government, thoroughly betraying the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people, and thus rolling into the ranks of the new bourgeoisie.

Now, the genuine Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary forces in Japan have begun to fiercely attack the Miyamoto group. Their strength is rapidly growing and strengthening. This is where the great hope of the Japanese nation lies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people firmly believe that the Japanese people will definitely drive the U.S. imperialists out of their own country, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will definitely be realized."

The great historical tide of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and the revolutionary and fighting friendship between Marxist-Leninists of the two countries, cannot be destroyed by any force. The peoples of China and Japan will unite more closely in the great struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of various countries, and march forward to victory!

    宫本集团的背叛
    本报评论员
    最近，日共宫本修正主义集团向资产阶级报界记者发表谈话，宣布召回日共驻中国代表砂间一良和《赤旗报》驻北京记者绀野纯一，并且无耻地造谣说，中国方面“采取各种手段”，对砂间和绀野“加紧施加压力”和进行“迫害”。这是他们紧密配合美帝、苏修和佐藤反动政府蓄意制造的又一个反华事件。
    我们早就料到，宫本修正主义集团和一些别有用心的人，会在砂间一良驻中国的问题上作反华文章。为了充分暴露他们反华的丑恶面目，剥掉他们在这个问题上的反华借口，使日本人民充分地看清宫本集团的反革命修正主义嘴脸，我们没有采取驱逐砂间的步骤。尽管砂间和绀野在中国进行反华活动，我们仍然给了他们作为驻中国客人应有的待遇。
    我们曾经看到，在砂间驻中国问题上，一些别有用心的人，以“左”的面目出现，攻击我们党不驱逐砂间。他们企图挑动我们，来为宫本集团制造反华资本。我们识破了他们的用心，没有理睬。我们就是要让宫本集团表演一番，看一看他们究竟要在这个问题上捣什么鬼。
    现在，宫本集团果然把召回砂间和绀野当作反华的一张牌亮了出来，再一次同一切反华英雄们联合行动，讨取美帝、苏修和日本反动派的奖赏。
    日修领导集团制造这个反华事件绝不是偶然的。长时期以来，他们就充当美帝、苏修和各国反动派反华大合唱的一名可怜的吹鼓手。日修报刊连篇累牍地发表反华文章。宫本、野坂赤膊上阵，大做反华演说。他们恶毒地诬蔑和攻击中国共产党和中国人民，诬蔑和攻击中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，诬蔑和攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，诬蔑和攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    反帝必须反修，反华必然降美。这是当代国际政治生活中无数事实证明了的颠扑不破的真理。谁要反对美帝国主义，就不能不反对为美帝国主义效劳的苏修领导集团。谁要反对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的坚决支持世界革命的社会主义中国，就必然投降美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联修正主义。宫本集团近几年来的演变，再一次说明这个真理。
    宫本集团口口声声说，要反对美帝国主义。那么，你们为什么同苏修合伙在国际上和日本国内破坏革命人民的反美斗争呢？你们为什么又竭力把美帝的头号帮凶苏修领导集团吹捧为反美力量呢？说穿了，你们是害怕美帝国主义，害怕苏联修正主义，害怕战争，害怕革命。你们反美是假的，为苏修投降美帝打掩护，从而也为自己投降美帝打掩护才是真的。
    宫本集团口口声声说，要搞什么反美援越的“统一行动”。那么，你们为什么要疯狂地攻击坚决反对美帝国主义，全力支持越南人民抗美救国战争的社会主义中国呢？美帝反华，苏修反华，佐藤政府反华，印度、印尼、缅甸等国反动派反华，你们的反华究竟同他们的反华有什么不同呢？没有什么不同，你们同他们不过是一丘之貉。你们鼓吹的“统一行动”，就是国际上一切牛鬼蛇神联合反华、反共、反人民、反革命的“统一行动”。
    宫本集团口口声声说，要“独立自主”，反对“事大主义”。那么，为什么你们公开袒护苏修领导集团作他们的应声虫呢？为什么你们执行的路线正是苏修推行的那一套“和平过渡”的议会道路呢？为什么你们攻击和诬蔑中国共产党的时候所用的滥调同苏修的一模一样呢？这是什么“独立自主”！你们是地地道道的事大主义者。你们“事”的是苏修之“大”。你们的总部，不过是苏修在日本的一家分号而已。
    宫本集团口口声声说，反对中国的“大国主义”，说什么中国共产党要把自己的路线强加给他们。笑话！难道我们还不知道你们是什么货色！怎么可以设想我们会把马克思列宁主义强加给你们这一伙修正主义者。实际上，是你们千方百计地硬要我们赞同你们的修正主义观点，三番五次地要我们同你们一道去同苏修搞什么“统一行动”。我们坚持马克思列宁主义原则立场，反对你们这一套修正主义货色，这难道是“强加于人”吗？这难道是“大国主义”吗？只有把自己的修正主义强加于人而达不到目的的人，才把中国共产党的这种马克思列宁主义的立场，诬蔑为“强加于人”的“大国主义”。
    宫本集团口口声声说，要“继承和发展”日本共产党反对日本帝国主义侵略中国的“传统”。日本共产党的确有反对日本帝国主义侵略中国的光荣传统，而从来没有帮助日本帝国主义反华的传统。现在，你们打着共产党的旗号，参加佐藤政府的反华行列，这倒是一个新“创造”。你们背叛了日本共产党的国际主义的革命传统，继承的是日本军国主义的反华传统。
    宫本集团疯狂反华，完全违背日本广大人民的意志和愿望。他们甘心充当美帝、苏修和佐藤政府的反华走卒，彻底背叛日本人民革命事业，这就滚到当代新工贼的行列中去了。
    现在，日本真正的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命力量，已经开始大造宫本集团的反。他们的力量正在迅速发展壮大。这是日本民族的伟大的希望所在。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“中国人民深信，日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”
    中日两国人民友好的伟大历史潮流，中日两国马克思列宁主义者之间的革命的战斗的友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。中日两国人民将在反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义，反对各国反动派的伟大斗争中，更加紧密地团结起来，胜利前进！
