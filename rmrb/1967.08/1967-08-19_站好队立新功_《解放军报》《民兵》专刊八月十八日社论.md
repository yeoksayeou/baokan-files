Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary."

In the sharp, complex, and intense class struggle, the issue of choosing sides, that is, the issue of adopting a political stance, is something that every member of the revolutionary ranks will encounter and must answer.

In this great proletarian cultural revolution, which is a decisive battle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, the issue of choosing sides is even more acute and urgent. Will you stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, or will you stand on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing the revolutionary masses and protecting the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road? This is an unprecedented historical test for everyone. All levels of militia work cadres must pay extreme attention to this issue and must definitely stand in line and firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Recently, Chairman Mao has instructed us: "Do not rely on past merits, but strive to achieve new merits." Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, also calls on us: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the great proletarian cultural revolution." To achieve new merits for the people, the first condition is to stand in line and firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao says: "With the change in stance, our attitude towards various specific matters also changes." If you stand in line correctly, you can handle problems correctly; if you stand in line incorrectly, you will make mistakes in everything.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!" Chairman Mao has put forward the great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses and to "support the army and love the people." All levels of militia work cadres must stand in line and achieve new merits, mainly by following Chairman Mao's instructions, responding to Chairman Mao's call, and firmly, unambiguously, and enthusiastically supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces, supporting their seizure of power, holding of power, and use of power, and supporting all their revolutionary actions. The better the support to the left is done, the more and greater new merits will be achieved for the people. Currently, some county (city) people's armed forces departments have done a good job in supporting the left, such as the people's armed forces departments of Miji County in Shaanxi Province, Zizhong City in Sichuan Province, and Pinggu County in Beijing. We should learn from them and catch up with them.

If you stand in the wrong line and support the wrong side, what should you do? As long as you do not persist in your mistakes, but instead frankly admit your mistakes, sincerely reflect on your mistakes, quickly and thoroughly correct your mistakes, and truly turn around and truly return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively supporting the broad leftist masses, it will be good, and you can achieve new merits for the people.

Militia work cadres need to stand in line and achieve new merits, and they need the help of the revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," follow the Military Commission's eight and ten orders, and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech at the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee's establishment and celebration meeting on April 20. They enthusiastically help and seriously supervise the militia work organs and militia work cadres using the method of criticism and the method of reflecting opinions, which is a necessary condition for all levels of militia work cadres to stand in line and achieve new merits. Whether it is the provincial military region, military sub-region, or county (city) people's armed forces department, or any comrade, they must correctly treat the revolutionary masses, humbly listen to their opinions and criticisms. If mistakes are made, they must be corrected decisively. If mistakes have been made and the wrong line has been chosen, but they are not admitted, not seriously reflected upon and corrected, then mistakes will be compounded. If anyone persists in their mistakes and goes their own way, straying further and further, they will inevitably be abandoned by history.

Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time, the greatest leader of the proletariat and revolutionary people of our time, and the most brilliant teacher. To stand in line and achieve new merits in the great proletarian cultural revolution, the most fundamental thing is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to closely follow Chairman Mao, and to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. One must seriously study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions. Whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we must resolutely carry out. If we understand, we must resolutely carry out; if we do not understand for the time being, we must also resolutely carry out. If it is consistent with our own thoughts, we must resolutely carry out; if it is not consistent with our own thoughts, we must also resolutely carry out. If we do not understand Chairman Mao's instructions, or if our own thoughts are not consistent with Chairman Mao's instructions, then we must carefully examine our own stance and understanding for problems, and seriously find answers in Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Comrades in militia work, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great waves of class struggle, constantly improve our class consciousness and self-awareness in carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, promote our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, correct our mistakes, and successfully complete the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao to support the broad leftist masses. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, let us achieve new merits for the people!

    站好队立新功
    ——《解放军报》《民兵》专刊八月十八日社论
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”
    在尖锐的、复杂的、激烈的阶级斗争中，站队问题，也就是采取一个什么样的政治立场的问题，是革命队伍中每一个人都要遇到，都必须给予回答的。
    在无产阶级文化大革命这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，站队问题更加尖锐、更加急迫地摆在每一个人的面前。你是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同广大革命群众并肩战斗，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边，压制革命群众，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派？这是对每一个人的前所未有的历史考验。各级民兵工作干部必须极端重视这个问题，一定要站好队，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    最近，毛主席教导我们：“不要吃老本，要立新功”。毛主席的亲密战友林副主席也号召我们：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”要为人民立新功，首要的条件就是要站好队，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。毛主席说：“随着立场，就发生我们对于各种具体事物所采取的具体态度。”站队站对了，才能够正确地处理问题；站队站错了，就会一错百错。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”毛主席提出了人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众和“拥军爱民”的伟大号召。各级民兵工作干部要站好队，立新功，最主要的就是要遵照毛主席的教导，响应毛主席的号召，坚定不移地、毫不含糊地、满腔热情地支持无产阶级革命派，支持他们夺权、掌权、用权，支持他们的一切革命行动。支左工作做得越好，为人民立的新功就越多，越大。目前，有些县（市）人民武装部支左工作是做得好的，例如陕西省米脂县人民武装部、四川省自贡市人民武装部、北京市平谷县人民武装部等单位。我们应该向他们学习，向他们看齐。
    如果站错了队，支左支错了，怎么办？只要不坚持错误，而是痛痛快快地承认错误，高姿态地检讨错误，迅速彻底地改正错误，并且真正地转过来，真正地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，积极支持左派广大群众，就是好的，就可以为人民立新功。
    民兵工作干部要站好队，立新功，很需要得到革命群众的帮助。广大革命群众积极响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，遵照军委八条和十条命令，贯彻执行江青同志四月二十日在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上的讲话的精神，用批评的方法，用反映意见的方法，热情地帮助和严肃地监督民兵工作机关和民兵工作干部，是各级民兵工作干部站好队、立新功的必要条件。不管是省军区、军分区还是县（市）人民武装部，不管是哪一个同志，都要正确地对待革命群众，虚心听取他们的意见和批评。犯了错误，就要坚决改正。如果已经站错了队，犯了错误，仍不承认，不认真检讨和改正，那就会错上加错，如果谁个坚持错误，一意孤行，越走越远，那就不可避免地要被历史所抛弃。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的天才，是当代无产阶级和革命人民最伟大的领袖，最英明的导师。要在无产阶级文化大革命中站好队，立新功，最根本的是要无限忠于毛主席，紧紧跟上毛主席，在头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。必须认真学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，坚决听毛主席的话。凡是毛主席的指示，我们就坚决执行。理解的要坚决执行，一时不理解的也要坚决执行。和自己的想法一致的要坚决执行，和自己的想法不一致的也要坚决执行。如果自己不理解毛主席的指示，或者自己的想法和毛主席的指示不一致，那就要仔细地从自己的立场和认识上找问题，认真地从毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示中找答案。
    民兵工作干部同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，不断提高自己的阶级觉悟和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，发扬成绩，克服缺点，纠正错误，胜利完成毛主席交给我们的支持左派广大群众的光荣任务，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功！
