The People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

The People's Liberation Army in Qinghai Province and the troops stationed in Xining have established new merits in supporting the left.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers have fully carried forward the glorious tradition of the people's army being both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. They have used Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to wholeheartedly help the revolutionary masses, and together with the revolutionary masses, they have carried out a great criticism, helped revolutionary masses' organizations achieve great unity, and implemented the "three-in-one combination."

XINING, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) — The People's Liberation Army in Qinghai Province and the troops stationed in the Xining area have enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses. With deep proletarian feelings, they have resolutely and enthusiastically supported the proletarian revolutionary factions. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province, they have established new merits for the people.

As early as last year, when the revolutionary youngsters posted the first big-character poster against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, Commander Liu Xianquan of the Qinghai Provincial Military District publicly expressed support. Later, he and other leaders of the troops together bravely and resolutely engaged in face-to-face struggles against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. After Chairman Mao issued the call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, the officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the stationed troops once again studied and discussed the wise instructions of the great helmsman Chairman Mao. Many cadres and soldiers took an oath before Chairman Mao's portrait, saying: We are the children of the people. In the past, we braved fire and water to fight for the people and establish merits. Today, in the fierce class struggle, we must definitely become the backbone of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and create new merits.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggles." In February this year, revolutionary mass organizations such as the "August 18th" in Qinghai Province launched a power seizure struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, in order to continue their reactionary rule, colluded with counter-revolutionaries and careerists, incited masses who were unaware of the true situation, surrounded and beat revolutionary masses, and carried out brutal suppression, stirring up a counter-revolutionary restoration tide. At the most difficult and critical moment for the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai Province, many cadres and soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the stationed troops, in order to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, with great revolutionary spirit, stood up one after another. They publicly wrote articles and letters to express their resolute support for the proletarian revolutionary factions with "August 18th" as the main body, and fiercely exposed the counter-revolutionary restoration plots of the class enemies. When the class enemies incited some unaware masses to surround and beat the People's Liberation Army cadres and soldiers who resolutely supported the revolutionary left, the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly withstood this countercurrent. They said, you can beat us, scold us, but you can never shake our resolve to respond to Chairman Mao's great call and support the proletarian revolutionary factions. The resolute support of the heroic People's Liberation Army greatly encouraged the broad masses of revolutionary mass organizations such as "August 18th" who were in extremely difficult situations, strengthened their revolutionary fighting spirit, and solidified their confidence in victory.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Qinghai Province and the stationed troops have fully carried forward the glorious tradition of the people's army being both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force in their support-left work. They have dispatched a large number of cadres and soldiers to form hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and propaganda groups, which have gone deep into factories, rural areas, schools, institutions, and enterprises to propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have used Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to wholeheartedly help the revolutionary masses, and together with the revolutionary masses, they have criticized a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, done work for the deceived masses, and striven to help revolutionary masses' organizations achieve great unity and the "three-in-one combination." A Mao Zedong Thought propaganda group composed of five cadres from a certain unit of the Qinghai Provincial Military District was responsible for the support-left work in eighteen units under the Xining Coal Construction Company. They braved wind, sun, and rain, going to various units every day, sometimes walking tens of miles, and sometimes missing meals, working with empty stomachs. They said: For the victory of the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions, missing a meal or sleeping less is nothing!

In order to help the proletarian revolutionary factions correctly solve various problems encountered in the struggle, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the stationed troops participating in the support-left work have firmly grasped the key of emphasizing politics. They have helped the proletarian revolutionary factions take the struggle between the two lines as the key, and studied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind. For some revolutionary masses who could not correctly treat the deceived masses, the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with them, making the revolutionary masses understand that they must use class standpoint and class analysis methods to distinguish between enemies and friends, and unite the vast majority of the masses around them to complete the historical mission of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many revolutionary masses said: We proletarian revolutionary factions love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. If we beat the deceived masses, we would violate Chairman Mao's teachings and damage the honor of "August 18th." Under the help of the Liberation Army, they focused their hatred on a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, consciously followed Chairman Mao's formula of "unity-criticism-unity," striving to educate and help the deceived masses, and help them recognize their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, quickly dissolving the conservative organizations and rapidly expanding the revolutionary leftist forces.

"The people, and the people alone, are the motive force of history." The broad masses of support-left personnel of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the stationed troops resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction. In the support-left work, they fully believed in the revolutionary masses, relied on the revolutionary masses, and wholeheartedly supported the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses, turning the pioneering achievements and advanced experiences of the revolutionary masses into living textbooks and living examples for promotion, and turning them into the common actions of the broad revolutionary masses. The Qinghai Provincial Second People's Hospital originally had three revolutionary mass organizations. The revolutionary masses of the surgery department first posted a big-character poster advocating the great unity of administrative departments. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in this hospital immediately wrote a big-character poster to express support that night. The revolutionary masses of the internal medicine and obstetrics departments all agreed, but some departments' revolutionary masses still had doubts. At this time, the revolutionary masses of the surgery department posted a second big-character poster, using specific facts to explain that the conditions for the great unity of administrative departments in the entire hospital had matured, and expounded the advantages of the great unity of administrative departments. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team immediately seized this big-character poster and propagated it extensively through broadcasting, and went deep into the revolutionary masses to propagate and explain, solving various active thoughts, quickly achieving the great unity of the three revolutionary mass organizations in the hospital according to administrative departments.

On the road forward, some units' revolutionary mass organizations had internal disagreements and appeared ununited. The comrades of the troops did not panic or use the simple method of supporting one side and suppressing the other. Instead, they organized the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and the "Three Articles," held lectures, discussions, and guided the revolutionary masses to seize the power of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party while seizing the power of the "self" in their minds, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide some revolutionary masses' petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the track of proletarian revolution, uniting as one and fighting against the enemy together. After achieving the great unity of the revolution, the leadership members of the People's Bank of China in Xining had disagreements, and some even wanted to take their own troops out to establish new organizations and carry out the revolution alone. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the troops, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of contradictions, believed that this was the reflection of non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary ranks. They studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Serve the People" with the members of the joint command, and openly discussed their thoughts, carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The comrades who originally wanted to go out and carry out the revolution alone all consciously examined their erroneous thoughts and firmly expressed their determination to be revolutionary pioneers with "public" first and not to be mediocre with "self" first, under the leadership of the joint command, directing the struggle spearhead straight at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This effectively consolidated the great unity of the revolution.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Military District and the stationed troops have established close combat friendships with the revolutionary masses in the class struggle storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have been supported and loved by the revolutionary masses. The officers and soldiers of various units, while actively supporting and helping the revolutionary masses, often actively seek the opinions of the revolutionary masses, humbly listen to the criticisms of the revolutionary masses, and seriously learn from the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, daring to struggle and daring to win. They study Chairman Mao's works actively in the class struggle storms, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and further strengthen their ideological revolutionization. They say, the victory of the power seizure struggle is only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march. The class struggle has not ended. We must forever unite with the proletarian revolutionary factions, fight with them, and win with them, defending the proletarian iron mountains and rivers forever unchanged.

    人民子弟兵无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    青海军区和驻军在支左中建立新功劳
    广大指战员充分发扬了人民军队既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，用毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，满腔热情地帮助革命群众，同革命群众一起开展革命的大批判，帮助革命群众组织实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    新华社西宁十三日电　无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的中国人民解放军青海省军区和驻西宁地区部队广大指战员，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的号召，满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，最坚决、最热情地支持无产阶级革命派，在青海省的无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立下了新的功劳。
    早在去年，当革命小将向青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派贴出第一张大字报时，青海省军区司令员刘贤权同志就公开表示支持。以后，他又和部队的其他领导干部一起，勇敢地、坚决地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了面对面的斗争。毛主席发出人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的号召以后，青海省军区和驻军广大指战员又再次地学习和讨论了伟大统帅毛主席的英明指示。许多干部、战士在毛主席像前宣誓说：我们是人民的子弟兵，过去我们赴汤蹈火，为人民打下了江山，建立了功勋。今天，在严峻的阶级斗争中，我们一定要成为无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱，创立新的功劳。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”今年二月，青海省“八·一八”等革命群众组织起来向青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了夺权斗争，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了继续维持他们的反动统治，勾结反革命分子、野心家，挑动不明真象的群众，对革命群众进行围斗、殴打，实行残酷的镇压，掀起了一股反革命复辟的逆流。在青海省无产阶级革命派处在最困难的关键时刻，青海省军区和驻军的许多干部、战士为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以大无畏的革命精神，纷纷挺身而出，公开写文章、写信表示坚决支持“八·一八”为主体的无产阶级革命派，狠狠揭露阶级敌人的反革命复辟阴谋。当阶级敌人煽动一些不明真象的群众围斗、殴打坚决支持革命左派的人民解放军干部、战士的时候，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军指战员坚决顶住了这股逆流。他们说，你们可以打我们，骂我们，但丝毫也动摇不了我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，支持无产阶级革命派的决心。英雄的人民解放军的坚决支持，给了处境极端困难的“八·一八”等革命群众组织的广大群众以极大鼓舞，增强了他们的革命斗志，坚定了他们必胜的信心。
    人民解放军青海省军区和驻军广大指战员，在支左工作中，充分发扬人民军队既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，抽调了大批干部、战士，组成了几百个毛泽东思想宣传队、宣传组，深入到工厂、农村、学校、机关、企业单位，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席、党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。他们用毛泽东思想，党的方针政策，满腔热情地帮助革命群众，同革命群众一起批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一起做受蒙蔽群众的工作，并且努力帮助革命群众组织实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。由青海省军区某部五名干部组成的毛泽东思想宣传组，担负了西宁市煤建公司所属十八个单位的支左任务。他们不顾风吹、日晒、雨淋，每天到各单位去做工作，最远要走几十里，有时赶不上饭吃，就饿着肚子干。他们说：为了无产阶级革命派斗争的胜利，少吃顿饭，少睡会觉，又算得了什么！
    为了帮助无产阶级革命派正确解决在斗争中遇到的各种问题，青海省军区和驻军参加支左的广大指战员，狠狠地抓住了突出政治这一环，帮助无产阶级革命派以两条路线斗争为纲，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。有些革命群众不能正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，就同他们一起学习毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，使革命群众懂得，必须用阶级观点，阶级分析的方法，分清敌友，把绝大多数群众团结在自己的周围，才能完成无产阶级文化大革命的历史重任。许多革命群众说：我们无产阶级革命派最爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，如果我们打了受蒙蔽的群众，就是违背毛主席的教导，损坏“八·一八”的荣誉。他们在解放军的帮助下，把仇恨集中到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，自觉地按照毛主席制定的“团结——批评——团结”的公式，争取教育受蒙蔽的群众，帮助受蒙蔽的群众，认清自己的错误，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，使保守组织很快瓦解，革命左派队伍迅速壮大。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”青海省军区和驻军广大支左人员坚决执行毛主席这一教导。在支左工作中充分相信革命群众，依靠革命群众，全力支持革命群众的首创精神，把革命群众的创举，先进经验做为活教材、活样板加以推广，变成广大革命群众的共同行动。青海省第二人民医院原有三个革命群众组织，外科革命群众首先贴出了按行政部门归口大联合的大字报，驻在这个医院的毛泽东思想宣传队发现这一情况，立即连夜写出大字报表示支持。内科、妇儿科革命群众都表示同意，但还有些科室的革命群众表示怀疑。这时，外科革命群众又贴出了第二张大字报，用具体事实说明全院实行按行政部门归口大联合的条件已经成熟，阐述了归口大联合的好处。毛泽东思想宣传队的同志又及时抓住这张大字报通过广播大力宣传，并且深入到革命群众中去宣传解释，使各种各样的活思想得到解决，很快使这个医院的三个革命群众组织实现了按行政部门归口大联合。
    在前进道路上，有些单位的革命群众组织，内部发生了意见分歧，出现了不团结现象。部队的同志对这种情况不是大惊小怪，更不是用简单的支持一方、压服一方的方法，而是针对革命群众的各种活思想，组织他们学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》和“老三篇”等光辉著作，召开讲用会，座谈会，引导革命群众在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，用毛泽东思想把一些革命群众的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来，团结一致，共同对敌。西宁市人民银行在实现革命的大联合以后，领导成员之间发生了意见分歧，有的甚至要拉出自己的人马，建立新的组织，单独闹革命。部队毛泽东思想宣传队根据毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的教导，认为这是非无产阶级思想在革命队伍内部的反映。他们和联合指挥部的委员一起学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等文章，一起亮思想，开展批评和自我批评。原来想出去单独闹革命的同志，都自觉地检查了自己的错误思想，坚决表示要做“公”字当头的革命闯将，不做“私”字当头的庸人，在联合指挥部的领导下，把斗争矛头一致直指党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这就有效地巩固了革命的大联合。
    青海省军区和驻军广大指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命的阶级斗争风浪中，同革命群众建立了亲密的战斗友谊，受到了革命群众的拥护和热爱。各部队指战员在积极支持、帮助革命群众的同时，经常主动地征求革命群众的意见，虚心地听取革命群众的批评，认真地学习革命群众无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命精神，在阶级斗争的风浪中活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，进一步加强思想革命化。他们说，夺权斗争的胜利仅仅是万里长征的第一步。阶级斗争并没有结束。我们一定要同无产阶级革命派永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山千秋万代永不变色。
