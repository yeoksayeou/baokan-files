The U.S. News & World Report recently published a dispatch from the Soviet Union, enthusiastically praising the Soviet revisionist leadership's thorough restoration of capitalism and their "significant momentum" towards Westernization.

The dispatch is highly appreciative of the Soviet revisionists' efforts to promote Western "lifestyles" to corrupt the Soviet people. It boasts, "The mood of life in the Soviet Union is constantly changing. Visitors can see signs of this from all angles." "Store windows display imported clothing. Italian and French leather shoes, clothes, skirts, sweaters, and hats from Eastern and Western Europe, along with Soviet-made Western-style clothing, are all on display in the windows." "The number of foreign films being shown is increasing."

The dispatch praises the Soviet revisionist leadership's counterrevolutionary actions in the economic sphere to restore capitalism. It emphasizes that Soviet industry and service sectors have "shifted towards a capitalist market economy," operating according to the "profit system." "Many state farms currently have to operate based on profit." "Free market trading is thriving because many items are hard to find in state-run stores."

The dispatch, in a tone of fear, discusses the Soviet people's nostalgia and respect for Stalin, saying, "The image of the person who made the Soviet Union a world power—Stalin—has almost completely disappeared, but he has not faded from the minds of the Russian people. Discussions about Stalin's role often lead to heated debates. Once, a Russian insisted to a companion, 'We must admit that we still respect Stalin's achievements.'"

The author of the dispatch worriedly asks, is it possible for the Soviet Union to return to the days of Stalin? He answers himself, "It is possible to return suddenly."

It is no surprise that the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine cheers for the Soviet revisionist leadership's restoration of capitalism and worries about the shaky rule of the Soviet revisionists. However, the overall development of Soviet history will not be determined by the will of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists. The great Soviet people, who once fought for socialism under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, will rise up and smash the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has capitulated to U.S. imperialism and restored capitalism.

    苏修复辟资本主义　美帝拍手叫好
    美刊害怕苏联人民怀念斯大林，为苏修统治摇摇欲坠而担心
    据新华社讯　不久前《美国新闻与世界报道》刊登一篇苏联通讯，为苏修领导集团彻底复辟资本主义和“向西方化摆动”的“很大势头”大声叫好。
    通讯对苏修大力推广西方“生活方式”来毒害苏联人民，非常欣赏。它得意地说：“苏联的生活情调正在不断改变着。访问者从各方面都可以看到说明这一点的迹象。”“商店橱窗里摆着进口服装。意大利和法国的皮鞋，从东欧和西欧进口的衣服、裙子、毛衣和帽子，同苏联仿制的西方款式的服装一起在橱窗里展出。”“上映的外国影片在增多。”
    通讯赞扬苏修领导集团在经济领域中复辟资本主义的倒行逆施。它强调说，苏联工业和服务性行业已向资本主义的“市场经济转变”，根据“利润制度经营”。“许多国营农场目前都必须根据利润来经营”。“自由市场的买卖是兴旺的，因为有许多东西是国营商店难得看见的”。
    通讯在恐惧地谈到苏联人民对斯大林的怀念和尊敬时说：“使苏联成为世界强国的人物——斯大林的图像，几乎完全消失，然而，他在俄国人的思想上并没有泯灭。关于斯大林的作用的讨论，往往引起激烈争论。有一次，一个俄国人坚持地对一名同伴说，‘我们必须承认，我们仍然尊敬斯大林所取得的成就。’”
    通讯的作者担心地提出，苏联有没有再回到斯大林年代的可能呢？他自己回答说：“是可能一下子回来的”。
    美帝国主义的宣传机器为苏修领导集团复辟资本主义叫好，为苏修统治的摇摇欲坠而担心，这是毫不奇怪的。但是，苏联历史总的发展，决不以美帝和苏修的意志为转移。曾经在列宁和斯大林领导下为社会主义而斗争的伟大苏联人民，必将奋起而战，把投降美帝、复辟资本主义的苏修领导集团的反动统治，砸个稀巴烂。
