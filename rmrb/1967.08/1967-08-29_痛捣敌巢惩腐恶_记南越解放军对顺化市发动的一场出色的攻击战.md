The armed forces of South Vietnam's Thanh Hoa Province recently launched a sudden and fierce attack on the strongholds of the American puppet forces in the center of Hue, the third-largest city in South Vietnam. They achieved a significant victory, annihilating over 800 enemy troops, including nearly 500 American invaders. This was a heavy blow to the American aggressors who had been hiding in their heavily fortified nests.

It was a Sunday evening. The American aggressors were staging a "victory celebration" in Hue, celebrating the so-called "victories" of the U.S. military in the "sweeping operations" south of the demilitarized zone.

At that moment, the brave and clever liberation forces, with the strong support of the people, skillfully breached the enemy's multiple lines of defense. They split into several groups, attacking from different directions and swiftly occupying various positions.

The enemy was completely unaware. From the stronghold of Hong River, where American military officers were gathered, bursts of nauseating laughter could be heard.

Suddenly, a thunderous explosion shook the air. The liberation forces blew up the transformer station in the Stone Dam area. The lights in two main districts of Hue went out simultaneously, plunging everything into darkness. The liberation forces' various types of recoilless guns, mortars, and machine guns roared to life, spewing flames of hatred at the enemy.

In the Stone Dam South area, the liberation forces swiftly annihilated a platoon of puppet soldiers. Comrade Thai, leading a assault team, under the cover of artillery, charged into the Hong River stronghold like an arrow leaving the bow. After eliminating two companies of South Korean mercenaries guarding the area, they swiftly and fiercely attacked the rooms where the American soldiers were staying.

The sound of hand grenades and hand bombs exploding continuously, and submachine guns firing in bursts. The enemy was stunned by the sudden attack; some did not even have time to scream before being shot down.

At the same time, another assault team, after eliminating the enemy in the Stone Dam area, rushed into the puppet military officers' club. Coordinating closely with Comrade Thai's assault team, they annihilated the enemy in this area. The engineering soldiers, seeing the signal from the assault team, immediately rushed forward, placed and detonated explosive packages. Instantly, the entire three-story building of the Hong River stronghold collapsed in a deafening explosion, killing or wounding over 400 enemy troops inside. Forty-five military vehicles parked around the stronghold were either blown up or set on fire.

Another group of liberation forces charged towards the Hong River shore, launching a fierce attack on the U.S. military wharf northeast of the Chau Dinh Bridge, destroying one landing craft. The sixteen enemy troops on board were all buried in the Hong River. Other enemy transport boats, seeing the situation, fled in panic. The Chau Dinh Bridgehead was also destroyed by the liberation forces' artillery.

The artillery unit coordinating with the liberation infantry also fought brilliantly. They bombarded the U.S. military "advisory" office, the Thanh Hoa military compound, and various puppet police stations with fierce artillery fire. The shells accurately hit the enemy barracks, exploding with a deafening roar. Over a hundred American troops and a large number of puppet soldiers were blown to pieces.

To rescue the American puppet forces in Hue, the enemy quickly dispatched two reinforcement units from Kun Xian and Go U. However, these enemy forces were intercepted by the liberation forces on their way, leaving behind a large number of corpses and retreating in disarray.

After the successful attack on Hue, the liberation forces safely returned to their base. An hour later, the puppet field police company cautiously emerged, and a batch of enemy aircraft suddenly appeared from somewhere, dropping flares over the entire city of Hue. The puppet artillery in the strongholds south and southeast of Hue also began firing indiscriminately, while the American aggressors hiding in the Phu Bai base did not dare to fire a single shell.

The citizens of Hue watched the entire battle with great excitement and joy. As soon as the gunfire stopped, many citizens rushed to the battlefield to congratulate the soldiers on their victory. The next day, thousands of people from across the Hong River and the surrounding suburbs came to see the humiliating end of the American invaders. The streets were packed with people, and the entire city of Hue was in a festive atmosphere. People enthusiastically celebrated the glorious victory of the liberation forces. The American aggressors and their lackeys were terrified, deploying warships, motorboats, transport vehicles, and helicopters to hastily remove the bodies of their comrades and trying to prevent people from approaching the scene, doing everything they could to cover up their defeat.

The great victory in Hue vividly demonstrated the rapid growth and increasing combat effectiveness of the liberation forces in the South. It also proved that there is no safe hiding place for American aggressors on the heroic land of South Vietnam.

    痛捣敌巢惩腐恶
    ——记南越解放军对顺化市发动的一场出色的攻击战
    越南南方承天省解放武装力量不久以前向南越的第三大城市顺化市中心的美伪军据点，突然发动猛烈袭击，取得歼敌八百多名（其中包括近五百名美国侵略军）的重大战果。这是解放武装力量给予盘踞在戒备森严的巢穴里的美国强盗的一次沉重的打击。
    那是一个星期天。这天晚上，美国强盗正在顺化市内演出一场“庆贺胜利”的丑剧，“庆贺”美军在非军事区南面疯狂“扫荡”的所谓“胜利”。
    就在这时，英勇机智的解放武装力量，在人民的大力协助下，巧妙地越过敌人的重重防线，分兵多路，从不同的方向插入顺化市，迅速地占领了各个进攻阵地。
    敌人当时还一无所知。从聚集着美军军官的香江据点里，不时传出一阵阵令人作呕的狂笑声……。
    霹雳一声巨响，解放武装力量炸毁了石坝地区的变压站。顺化市两个主要街区的灯火突然一齐熄灭，顿时一片漆黑。解放武装力量的各种不同口径的无后座力炮、迫击炮和机枪，同时向敌人喷出了仇恨的火舌。
    在石坝南面地区，解放武装力量迅速地全歼了伪军哨兵一个排。泰同志率领的一个突击组，在炮兵的掩护下，象离弦的箭，插入香江据点，在歼灭了守卫的南朝鲜帮凶军两个排之后，又飞快地向美军住宿的各个房间猛烈进攻。
    手雷和手榴弹的爆炸声连续不断，手提机枪射出一排排子弹。敌人被这突然的袭击吓昏了，有的还来不及发出一声惊叫就被子弹打中倒地。
    和这同时，另一个突击组在消灭了石坝地区敌人以后，接着就冲进了伪军军官的俱乐部，同泰同志的突击组密切配合，全歼了这个地区的敌人。工兵战士看到突击组发出的信号，立即冲上前去，安放并点燃了炸药包。顿时，香江据点的整座三层大楼在惊天动地的爆炸声中倒塌了，大楼和附近几座楼房里的四百多名敌人非死即伤。停放在据点周围的四十五辆军车全部被炸毁或被击中起火。
    另一路解放武装力量直扑香江江边，猛烈进攻盏店桥东北的美军军用码头，击毁登陆艇一艘，艇上的十六名敌人全部葬身在香江之中。其他几艘敌人运输艇见势不妙，仓皇逃窜。盏店桥桥头堡也被解放武装力量的炮弹摧毁。
    和解放军步兵协同作战的某炮兵部队也打得非常出色。他们用猛烈的炮火轰击顺化市内的美军“顾问”处、承天军事小区和各个伪警察所。一排排炮弹准确地击中敌人的营房，发出轰?轰?的爆炸声。一百多名美军和大批伪军被炸得粉身碎骨。
    为了救援顺化市内的美伪军，敌人连忙从昆献和格乌派出两支增援部队。但这些敌军在中途分别遭到了解放武装力量的截击，丢下大批尸体，狼狈地退回去了。
    解放武装力量在胜利袭击顺化市敌人后，安全返回基地。过了一个小时，伪军野战警察连才提心吊胆地摸了出来，一批敌机这时也不知从什么地方钻出来，在整个顺化市上空投照明弹，在顺化市南面和东南面的据点里的伪军炮兵，也开始漫无目的地胡乱打炮，而龟缩在芙拜基地里的美国强盗在这时却连一发炮弹也不敢放。
    顺化市民怀着万分激动和兴奋的心情关注着战斗的整个进程。枪声刚停，许多市民便立刻跑到阵地上，向战士们热烈祝贺胜利。第二天，成百上千的人群从香江对岸和四周郊区赶来要亲眼看一看美国侵略军的可耻下场。各条街道被人流挤得水泄不通，整个顺化市象节日一样的沸腾起来，人们尽情欢呼解放武装力量的辉煌胜利。美国强盗及其走狗则惊恐万状，他们出动战船、汽艇、运输车和直升飞机，抢运他们同伙的尸首，并且竭力阻止人们接近现场，千方百计地掩饰他们的惨败。
    顺化大捷雄辩地证明了南方解放武装力量的飞跃成长，战斗力日益增强。同时也证明，在越南南方英雄的土地上，到处都没有美国侵略者的安全的藏身之所。
