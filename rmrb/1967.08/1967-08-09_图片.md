Revolutionary farmers from Lingqiao People's Commune in Shanghai's Chuansha County, together with soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, enthusiastically celebrated the first anniversary of the convening of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. The military and the people sang and danced together at the village entrance, performing artistic programs praising the "Sixteen Points," and joyfully singing long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They wished our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!
