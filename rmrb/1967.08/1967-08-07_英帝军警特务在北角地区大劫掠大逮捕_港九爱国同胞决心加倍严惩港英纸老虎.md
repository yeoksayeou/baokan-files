The Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee today issued a statement strongly protesting the British imperialists' deployment of helicopters and a large number of armed military police to raid and loot three buildings in North Point, Hong Kong Island, and arbitrarily arrest the committee's deputy chairman, Huang Jianli, and residents, in a fascist atrocity.

The statement seriously warns the British authorities: They must immediately stop the bloody suppression, must immediately stop all white terror measures, and must immediately release our committee's responsible person Huang Jianli, Tang Bingda, Fu Qi, and all patriots who have been arbitrarily arrested. The ringleaders who insult our great leader and the dignity of our country must be severely punished. The solemn demands of our country's government and Hong Kong patriots must be unconditionally accepted. If they dare to continue playing with fire and push to the limit, they will surely face double the severe punishment from our patriots and the Chinese people.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon education sector, Hanhua Middle School, and the East District Five Schools Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee also issued statements today, strongly protesting the British fascist atrocities.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on August 5, the crazed British fascist authorities on August 4 launched a large-scale operation, deploying British land forces, police, and marine police, to raid, illegally search, and loot the residences of staff from our institutions in Hong Kong, patriotic organizations, patriotic overseas Chinese, and residents' homes, and illegally abduct our patriots. This large-scale armed raid is another serious escalation of the British authorities' fascist atrocities.

On the morning of August 4, the British authorities dispatched armed police and seven companies of the "riot control squad," one company of the British Army's "Wales Regiment," and thousands of plainclothes agents to surround the "Chiu Kwong Building" and the adjacent "New Town Building" and "Ming Yuen Building" in the North Point area. The British aircraft carrier "HMS Hermes," which had recently arrived in Hong Kong, also openly participated in the suppression, deploying three helicopters to continuously transport armed police and plainclothes agents to the rooftops of the buildings for raids. At the same time, the British authorities also dispatched marine police boats to coordinate from the sea. After blowing up the iron doors on the rooftops and prying open the main doors, these fascist thugs stormed into the buildings and conducted illegal searches house by house. The British military police did not withdraw until after 3 PM.

In this fascist atrocity by the British authorities, the residences of staff from the Bank of China, Hua Feng National Products Company, the preparatory office of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Medical Center, the Fujian Association, the Motorcycle Industry Workers Union Hong Kong Bus Branch, and the Hong Kong Electric Company Chinese Employees Union, as well as the residences of patriotic organizations, patriotic overseas Chinese, and residents, totaling more than a thousand, were subjected to armed raids and looting. At the same time, 30 patriots, including Huang Jianli, deputy chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee, and Wu Linhua, manager of Hua Feng National Products Company, were illegally abducted. Forty employees of Hua Feng National Products Company and four employees of the preparatory office of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Medical Center were beaten. Particularly serious was that the British military police, upon invading various institutions and residences, actually destroyed and desecrated portraits of Chairman Mao, our most beloved great leader, and wantonly tore up the Little Red Book, insulted our national flag, wrote anti-China slogans, and drew the insignia of the Kuomintang bandits on the walls. This is a serious political provocation that seven hundred million Chinese people cannot tolerate.

After the British military police stormed into Hua Feng National Products Company, they wantonly beat the company's employees, ransacked the place, tore down the anti-British resistance slogans posted inside, and looted property, subjecting the employees to personal humiliation. In the "Chiu Kwong Building," the thugs illegally broke into the residences of Bank of China and various patriotic organizations' staff, as well as the residences of patriotic overseas Chinese and residents, conducting indiscriminate searches. They also destroyed the interior of the Fujian Association. In the "New Town Building," all medical equipment and drugs in the preparatory office of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Medical Center were looted, and four employees were severely beaten, with two being sprayed with poison. In the "Ming Yuen Building," the Motorcycle Industry Workers Union Hong Kong Bus Branch and the Hong Kong Electric Company Chinese Employees Union were ransacked and destroyed. What is particularly intolerable is that these thugs dared to soak the national flag of the People's Republic of China in a bucket of water, deliberately insulting our great motherland.

The British authorities' fascist atrocities have aroused the extreme indignation of Hong Kong patriots. The Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and all employees of Hua Feng National Products Company issued a statement, expressing the strongest protest.

In the afternoon of August 5, several hundred patriotic students, with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao at the forefront, held a massive demonstration in the streets of North Point, strongly protesting the British authorities' atrocities.

    英帝军警特务在北角地区大劫掠大逮捕  港九爱国同胞决心加倍严惩港英纸老虎
    据新华社香港五日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会今天发表声明，强烈抗议港英帝国主义四日出动直升飞机和大批武装军警袭击、搜掠港岛北角三座大厦，无理拘捕斗委会副主任委员黄建立和居民的法西斯暴行。
    声明严重警告港英当局：必须立即停止血腥镇压行动，必须立即停止一切白色恐怖措施，必须立即释放我各界斗委会负责人黄建立、汤秉达、傅奇以及所有被无理逮捕的爱国同胞，侮辱我们伟大领袖和祖国尊严的罪魁祸首必须受到严惩，我国政府和香港爱国同胞提出的严正要求必须无条件接受。如敢继续玩火，蛮干到底，必将受到我爱国同胞和中国人民的加倍严厉惩罚。
    港九教育界、汉华中学、港岛东区五校等反对港英迫害斗争委员会，今天也纷纷发表声明，最强烈地抗议港英法西斯暴行。
    据新华社香港五日电　疯狂到极点的港英法西斯当局，四日大规模地出动英国陆军、警察和水警轮等，武装突袭、非法搜查、劫掠我驻港机构人员的宿舍和爱国机构、爱国侨眷和居民住宅，并非法绑架我爱国同胞。这次大规模的武装突袭，是港英当局法西斯暴行的又一次严重的升级。
    四日早上六时许，港英当局派出了武装警察和“防暴队”七个连、英国陆军“威尔斯兵团”一个连和大批便衣特务共千余人，包围了北角地区的“侨冠大厦”和邻近的“新都城大厦”和“明园大厦”。最近抵达香港的英国航空母舰“赫姆斯号”也公然参与了这次镇压行动，出动了三架直升飞机，把武装警察和便衣特务不断运至各大厦的天台，进行突袭。在这同时，港英当局还派有水警轮从海面配合。在爆炸各大厦的天台铁门和撬毁大门后，这些法西斯暴徒便冲进大厦内，进行逐户非法搜查。港英军警一直搜捕到下午三时多才撤走。
    在港英法西斯当局这次暴行中，遭到武装突袭搜查和劫掠的有我国家驻港机构中国银行职工的宿舍、华丰国货公司、香港中华总商会医疗所筹备处、福建同乡会、摩托车业职工总会香港巴士（公共汽车）分会、香港电灯公司华员职工会，以及爱国机构宿舍、爱国侨眷和居民住宅千余户。同时还非法绑架我爱国同胞三十人，包括港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会副主任委员、汉华中学校长黄建立和华丰国货公司经理吴麟华在内。殴伤华丰国货公司职工四十余人、香港中华总商会医疗所筹备处职工四人。尤其严重的是，港英军警在入侵各机构和住宅时，竟然捣毁和污辱中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席像，肆意撕毁宝书《毛主席语录》，侮辱我国国旗，涂写反华标语和在墙上画蒋匪帮的旗徽。这是七亿中国人民绝不能容忍的严重政治挑衅。
    港英军警冲进华丰国货公司后，肆意殴打公司职工，翻箱倒箧，撕毁公司内张贴的反英抗暴标语并搜劫财物，对职工进行人身侮辱。在“侨冠大厦”，暴徒们非法闯进中国银行和各爱国机构职工的宿舍，以及爱国侨眷和居民住宅滥施搜查，同时捣毁了福建同乡会的室内装置。在“新都城大厦”内的香港中华总商会医疗所筹备处的各种医疗设备、药品被搜劫一空，四名职工遭毒打，还有两名被毒液喷射。在“明园大厦”内的摩托车业职工总会香港巴士分会和香港电灯公司华员职工会会所，在港英警察撬门闯入后，被大肆搜劫破坏，尤其难以令人容忍的是，这些暴徒竟然胆敢将会所内的中华人民共和国国旗浸在水桶内，蓄意侮辱我们伟大的祖国。
    港英当局的法西斯暴行激起了香港爱国同胞无比的愤慨。华丰国货公司反对港英迫害斗争委员会和全体职工发表声明，提出最强烈的抗议。
    五日下午，在北角街头，几百位爱国青年学生以巨幅毛主席画像作前导，举行了声势浩大的示威游行，强烈抗议港英当局的暴行。
