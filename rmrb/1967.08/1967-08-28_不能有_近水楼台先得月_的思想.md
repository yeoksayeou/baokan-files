The Red Guards of Zoucheng Bus Station organized discussions and criticism of the "near water pavilion gets the moon first" mentality. Their self-aware practice of thrift and resistance to the infiltration of bourgeois ideology is commendable.

We, the revolutionary proletariat, must prioritize the interests of the state and the class interests of the proletariat in everything we do. We must resolutely respond to the recent call from our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to further promote thrift and revolution. We must firmly oppose, resist, and fight against any waste of state property, and consciously become models of thrift and revolution.

Not long ago, when the revolutionary mass organization of Gaomi Bus Station was established, Zoucheng Bus Station sent two representatives to attend the celebration along with the cargo trucks. Later, some comrades suggested that since we are sister stations and on the same route, everyone should go to celebrate. Thus, the station specially arranged a large truck to take everyone there.

Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's instruction to "promote thrift and revolution," we had a debate on this issue. A driver comrade said, "The round trip to Gaomi is over 200 miles, and it wasted 40 liters of gasoline..." Some comrades, however, were indifferent and said, "Our country has the Daqing Oilfield, and we are self-sufficient in oil. What's the big deal about using an extra 40 liters of gasoline?" But more comrades seriously pointed out: although 40 liters of gasoline is a small matter, this trend cannot be allowed to continue. We are in charge of managing vehicles and must not have the "near water pavilion gets the moon first" mentality, casually using state gasoline. In the past, when the proletarian revolutionaries were in a suppressed position, they struggled and won the support and sympathy of the broad masses through hard work and thrift. Now that our position has changed and we have power and money, can we continue to maintain the spirit of hard work and thrift? This is a major test of whether a person is a thorough revolutionary.

After this debate, the great call to "promote thrift and revolution" began to take root here as a conscious action. Comrades cherish the vehicles, save fuel, and strive to make every drop of gasoline play its due role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

### 不能有“近水楼台先得月”的思想

    不能有“近水楼台先得月”的思想
    诸城汽车站的红卫兵，组织大家讨论和批判“近水楼台先得月”思想。他们自觉地厉行节约、抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的作法，好得很。
    我们无产阶级革命派，无论做什么事，都要以国家利益为重，以无产阶级的阶级利益为重。我们要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席和党中央最近发出的要进一步节约闹革命的号召，对浪费国家财产的现象，要坚决反对，坚决抵制，坚决作斗争，自觉地成为节约闹革命的模范。
　　　                       　　——编者
    不久以前，高密汽车站革命群众组织成立的时候，我们诸城汽车站派去了两名代表，随运货的汽车前往祝贺。后来有的同志提出，我们是兄弟站，又是一条线路，大家都去祝贺祝贺，才象个样子。于是，站上专门安排了一辆大卡车，把大家都送去了。
    最近，我们学习了毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，就上面这个问题展开了辩论。驾驶员同志说：“到高密来回二百多里，光汽油就浪费了四十公升……”。也有个别同志毫不在乎地说：“我们国家有大庆油田，石油已经自给了，多用四十公升汽油有什么了不起！”但是更多的同志严肃地指出：四十公升汽油虽然是小事，但此风不可长。我们是管理汽车的，决不能有“近水楼台先得月”的思想，随便用国家的汽油。无产阶级革命派，在过去处于被压制的地位的时候，艰苦朴素闹革命，赢得了广大群众的支持和同情，也锻炼了自己。现在地位改变了，手中有权、有钱，在这种情况下，能不能继续保持艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的作风，这是考验一个人是不是彻底的革命者的大问题。
    经过这次辩论，“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，开始在这里成为人们自觉的行动。同志们爱护车辆，节约燃料，要让每一滴汽油在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥应有的作用。
