Recently, leaders from the revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhan, including "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel 9.13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance," gathered together. They unanimously expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to unite more closely. They vowed to fight resolutely to thoroughly overthrow China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region. This marks a significant step forward in the path of unity and struggle for the revolutionary masses of Wuhan. It is a heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as their agents in the Wuhan region.

In the midst of the fervor for great unity and great alliance among the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations have played a leading role. This leadership is timely and effective!

The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations bear a great responsibility for achieving revolutionary great unity. They should stand at the forefront of the masses, overcome interference from all sides, and actively promote revolutionary great unity in the midst of revolutionary great criticism. It must be recognized that the broad revolutionary masses are eager to unite and fight together against the enemy. Anyone who goes against the will of the masses, indulges in "internal strife," and insists on dragging the serious political struggle into the quagmire of factional struggle, will inevitably face resistance and opposition from the revolutionary masses.

In the process of revolutionary great unity, every revolutionary comrade must adhere to the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, break away from selfishness, and uphold selflessness. They must overcome petty bourgeois ideas such as small-groupism, sectarianism, regionalism, and individualism.

"The revolutionary masses should unite and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road!" This is the strategic slogan put forward by our great leader. Only by uniting can the revolutionary masses of the proletariat successfully carry out the seizure and consolidation of power. If personal and small-group interests are placed above class and revolutionary interests, and if one is mired in struggles for personal and small-group power and profit, one will inevitably end up losing power and becoming estranged from the revolutionary masses, ultimately becoming a fleeting figure. This will only cause pain to friends and joy to enemies.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan have grown and strengthened through the fierce class struggle. They have deeply felt the importance of revolutionary great unity from their own experiences. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan are concentrating their new and old grievances on the main enemy of the proletariat—the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and their agents in the Wuhan region. As for the past disagreements within the revolutionary ranks, they are putting small matters aside for big matters, engaging in self-criticism, focusing on the strengths of the other side, cherishing the comradeship forged in joint struggles, and further consolidating and developing this comradeship. This has led to a new and excellent situation for revolutionary great unity in Wuhan.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Every Communist must understand that the words and deeds of Communists must conform to the highest standard of serving the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by them."

Currently, the focus is on carrying out revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly destroying the bourgeois headquarters led by the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically. This is in the greatest interests of the Chinese people and is the highest standard for all our words and deeds. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan are truly achieving revolutionary great unity in thought and organization, carrying out revolutionary great criticism, and firmly grasping the overall direction of the struggle. This is the key to the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Wuhan.

Under the close care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the full support of the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan have the conditions and should become a model of revolutionary great unity and great alliance. They should become a model of carrying out revolutionary great criticism. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan should, through their actual actions in promoting the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, support the struggle of the 30 million revolutionary people of Hubei, and support the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country.

Let us closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, brandish our swords, and march forward bravely!

    做革命大联合的模范
    最近，武汉“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命群众组织负责人共聚一堂，一致表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步紧密地联合起来，为彻底打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人而斗争。这是武汉地区无产阶级革命派在联合战斗的道路上迈出的新的一大步。这是对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人的沉重打击。
    在武汉地区无产阶级革命派大团结、大联合的热潮中，革命群众组织的负责人起了带头作用。这个头带得及时，带得好！
    革命群众组织的负责人，对实现革命的大联合，负有重大的责任。他们应当站在群众的前头，排除来自各方的干扰，在革命的大批判中积极地推进革命的大联合。应当看到，广大革命群众是迫切要求团结起来，共同对敌的。谁要违背群众的意愿，热衷于打“内战”，硬要把严肃的政治斗争拉到宗派斗争的歧途上去，那就必然会受到革命群众的抵制和反对。
    在革命的大联合过程中，每个革命同志都要用毛泽东思想挂帅，大破私字，大立公字，克服自己头脑中的小团体主义、宗派主义、山头主义、个人主义等小资产阶级思想。
    “无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权！”这是我们伟大领袖提出的战略口号。无产阶级革命派只有联合起来，才能胜利地进行夺权和掌权。如果把个人的和小团体的利益置于阶级利益和革命利益之上，陷于为个人和小团体争权夺利，这样势必越夺越没有权，越脱离革命群众，以至使自己成为昙花一现的人物。这只能使亲者痛，仇者快。
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，是在严酷的阶级斗争中成长、壮大起来的。他们从自己切身的实践中，深切地体会到革命大联合的重要。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，正把新仇旧恨集中到无产阶级的主要的敌人，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人身上；而对于革命队伍内部以往出现的分歧，做到小道理服从大道理，双方多作自我批评，多看对方长处，珍惜在共同斗争中所凝结成的战斗友谊，进一步巩固和发展了这个友谊，使武汉地区革命大联合出现了崭新的大好形势。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”
    当前，开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部，这是中国人民的最大利益，是我们一切言论和行动的最高标准。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派真正从思想上、组织上实现革命的大联合，开展革命的大批判，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，这是决定武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的关键。
    在毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀下，在人民解放军三军广大指战员和全国无产阶级革命派的全力支持下，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派完全有条件，而且应该成为革命大团结、大联合的模范，成为深入开展革命大批判的模范。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派要以搞好武汉文化大革命的实际行动，支援湖北三千万革命人民的斗争，支援全国无产阶级革命派的斗争。
    让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，横刀跃马，奋勇前进！
