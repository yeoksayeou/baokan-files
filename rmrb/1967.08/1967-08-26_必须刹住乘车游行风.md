    To the Editor:

    Over the past week or so, we have frequently seen parades involving dozens, even hundreds of cars. We believe that to criticize, expose, and denounce the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, to resolutely counter his repeated and ferocious attacks, and to support and rally with revolutionary comrades in other regions, it is necessary and completely justified to hold parades and demonstrations. We not only enthusiastically support these actions but also actively participate in them. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Save every copper coin for the cause of war and revolution, for our economic construction." We feel that using cars for parades does not align with Chairman Mao's directive to "be thrifty and make revolution." Every revolutionary comrade has the responsibility to save every piece of coal, every watt of electricity, and every drop of gasoline for the nation. Therefore, we suggest that in the future, parades should not use cars but should adopt the form of marching in columns. This way, we can save gasoline, avoid disrupting traffic, and effectively carry out other propaganda work.

    Editor's Note: Recently, there has been a trend of motorcade parades on the streets of Shanghai. Many revolutionary rebel soldiers and revolutionary masses have written to us expressing their views that using cars for parades and demonstrations not only contradicts the principle of "being thrifty and making revolution" but also easily causes traffic congestion and brings many inconveniences. As proletarian revolutionaries, with our boundless love for our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and our determination to defend the proletarian headquarters to the death, it is entirely necessary for us to hold grand demonstrations to counterattack the new onslaughts of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and to support and rally with revolutionary comrades in other regions. However, we proletarian revolutionaries must also become models of "being thrifty and making revolution," always considering how to save the nation's expenses, and ensuring that every penny and every bit of resources are used for the work of "grasp revolution, promote production." Therefore, we must pay attention to this and stop the trend of motorcade parades.

    必须刹住乘车游行风编辑同志：
    最近一个多星期以来，我们常常看到用几十辆，甚至上百辆汽车进行游行。我们认为，为了批倒、批透、批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫以及他在各地的代理人所犯下的滔天罪行，为了迎头痛击其一次又一次的猖狂反扑，为了声援和支持其他地区的无产阶级革命派，进行游行示威，是非常必要的，也是完全应该的。我们不但热烈支持，而且积极参加。但是，毛主席教导我们：“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”。用汽车游行，我们觉得是不符合毛主席所提出的“要节约闹革命”的指示的。我们每一个无产阶级革命派的战士，都有责任为国家节约每一块煤，每一度电，每一滴汽油。为此，我们建议，今后游行，不要用汽车，采用列队的形式。这样，既节约汽油，又不影响交通和做好其他的宣传工作。上海木材公司技术研究设计室造反派战士　陆士连、何仲芳、王凤翔
    上海《工人造反报》编者按：最近在上海街头上，不断出现乘车游行之风。不少革命造反派战士、革命群众纷纷来信反映，认为乘车游行示威，既不符合“节约闹革命”的方针、原则，又容易阻塞交通，带来许多不便。我们无产阶级革命派怀着对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和表示誓死保卫无产阶级司令部的决心，迎头痛击党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的新反扑，声援和支持各地无产阶级革命派，举行声势浩大的示威游行是完全必要的。但是，我们无产阶级革命派还必须成为“节约闹革命”的模范，处处考虑节省国家的开支，使每一厘钱，每一点物资都用于“抓革命，促生产”的工作。所以必须引起我们无产阶级革命派的注意，不要乘车游行。
