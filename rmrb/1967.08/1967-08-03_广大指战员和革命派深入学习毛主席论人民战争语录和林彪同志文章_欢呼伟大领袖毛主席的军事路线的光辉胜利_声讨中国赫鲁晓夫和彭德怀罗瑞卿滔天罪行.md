Broad masses of soldiers and revolutionaries are deeply studying Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war and Comrade Lin Biao's articles. They are celebrating the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's military line and denouncing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

New China News Agency, August 2nd: Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, and revolutionary masses from various places, have been studying Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war and Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" in depth. They are enthusiastically praising the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's military line and fiercely criticizing the bourgeois military line of China's Khrushchev and his agents within the military. They are determined to thoroughly purge the reactionary bourgeois military line and all its poisonous influences politically, ideologically, and theoretically. They will firmly grasp the gun and ensure that the socialist iron fortress will never change color.

While studying Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's "Long Live the Victory of People's War," the broad masses of soldiers and people in various places have also studied the editorials in "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "Liberation Army Daily" commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The heroic soldiers and revolutionary fighters of the proletariat have repeatedly shouted, "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's military line!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!"

Troops in Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Xining, Hohhot, and revolutionary masses in local areas have organized reporting meetings, sharing sessions, symposiums, and get-togethers to discuss the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's military line. They pointed out: The 40 years of building the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the 40 years of brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's great military thought, and the 40 years of Chairman Mao's military line continuously defeating the reactionary bourgeois military line. The path indicated by Chairman Mao is the path to victory, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the line of victory. On the glorious occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the army, many old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in battles north and south introduced to the revolutionary youngsters the heroic deeds of marching from victory to victory under Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Many active learners of Chairman Mao's works, together with proletarian revolutionaries, exchanged their experiences and insights on advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and tempering themselves. The unit that has been guarding Chairman Mao since the Yan'an era, the First Guard Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison, launched the "Three Discussions and Three Observations" activity: discussing what the company's growth relies on? observing the great power of Chairman Mao's military line; discussing what the company's progress in the new situation relies on? observing the great power of Mao Zedong Thought; discussing how to adhere to Chairman Mao's military line? observing the determination and actions for future revolutionization. They said, we have grown up under Chairman Mao's affectionate guidance, and every step we have taken is under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal driving force guiding us forward. The soldiers of a certain unit of the Kunming Army, which was named by the Ministry of National Defense as a "Political Border Model Company," sat together with local revolutionary people of all ethnic groups on the occasion of the festival to discuss the victories of border struggles. They cited a large number of vivid examples to illustrate that adhering to Chairman Mao's military line is the fundamental guarantee to build the border line into an iron wall. They firmly stated that they would strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's military line, accelerate the construction of the border, and build every village into a red fortress bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

While celebrating the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's military line, the broad masses of soldiers, proletarian revolutionary fighters, and revolutionary masses have an even greater hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to fiercely expose and criticize the various reactionary acts of these capitalists who are in power. The new and old pilots of the "Aviation Hero Squadron" named by the Ministry of National Defense put forward the slogan: "Strike down the American wolf in the air, beat the 'fallen dog' on the ground." They fiercely exposed and criticized Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing and their ilk, who, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party, opposed Chairman Mao's correct line and Chairman Mao's military thought, attempting to lead our army onto the path of a bourgeois army and turn it into a tool for their capitalist restoration. They angrily said, "How can an ant shake a tree?" Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, their fate, like that of all reactionaries, is doomed to complete failure. The people of Shandong, who have created merits in the revolutionary war years, used their own battle experiences as examples to angrily denounce China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, for their heinous crimes of opposing Chairman Mao's military line. They said: We have always won battles relying on Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics. Vice Chairman Lin said, the greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death. This is an absolute truth. They stated that in the surging tide of the great criticism, thoroughly criticizing this handful of conspirators and careerists is the greatest historical task, the greatest political responsibility, and the greatest service to the people. We must pursue and strike them down, and let these "fallen dogs" never stand up again.

Through the enthusiastic praise of the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's military line and the fierce criticism of China's Khrushchev and his agents' bourgeois military line, the military and people across the country are more closely united. Everywhere, a fighting atmosphere of the military loving the people, the people supporting the military, and the military and people uniting to fight the enemy is emerging.

    广大指战员和革命派深入学习毛主席论人民战争语录和林彪同志文章
    欢呼伟大领袖毛主席的军事路线的光辉胜利  声讨中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀罗瑞卿滔天罪行
    新华社二日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军指战员和各地无产阶级革命派，连日来，深入学习毛主席论人民战争的语录和林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》，大讲大颂毛主席军事路线伟大胜利，狠批猛批中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内代理人的资产阶级军事路线，决心从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底肃清反动的资产阶级军事路线及其一切流毒，牢牢掌握枪杆子，保证社会主义铁打江山永不变色。
    各地广大军民在学习毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席的《人民战争胜利万岁》的同时，结合学习了《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》纪念中国人民解放军建军四十周年的社论。英雄的指战员和无产阶级革命派战士在学习中，一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席的军事路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    北京、上海、济南、西宁、呼和浩特等地的部队和当地的革命群众，都组织了报告会、讲用会、座谈会、联欢会，畅谈毛主席的军事路线的伟大胜利。他们指出：中国人民解放军建军的四十年，是毛主席伟大军事思想辉煌胜利的四十年，是毛主席军事路线不断战胜反动的资产阶级军事路线的四十年。毛主席指引的道路，就是胜利的道路，毛主席的革命路线，就是胜利的路线。在欢庆建军四十周年的光辉节日里，许多跟随毛主席南征北战的老红军战士，向革命小将介绍了在毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想指引下，从胜利走向胜利的英雄业绩，许多学习毛主席著作积极分子，同无产阶级革命派一起，交流沿着毛主席的革命路线前进和锻炼成长的心得体会。从延安时代起就一直守卫在毛主席身边的北京卫戍区某部警卫一连，开展了“三谈三看”活动：谈连队成长靠什么？看毛主席军事路线的巨大威力；谈连队在新的形势下进步靠什么？看毛泽东思想的巨大威力；谈如何坚持毛主席建军路线，看今后革命化的决心和行动。他们说，我们是在毛主席的亲切教导下成长的，我们的每一步，都是在毛泽东思想照耀下走过来的。毛泽东思想是指引我们前进的永恒的动力。荣获国防部命名的昆明部队某部“政治边防模范连”的指战员，在节日里，和当地各族革命群众一起，座谈边防斗争的胜利，他们举出的大量的生动的事例说明，遵循毛主席的军事路线前进，是把边防线建成坚如磐石的铜墙铁壁的根本保证。他们坚定地表示一定要更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，沿着毛主席的军事路线，加速边疆建设，把驻地的每一个村寨，都建设成为毛泽东思想阳光普照的红色堡垒。
    广大指战员、无产阶级革命派战士和革命群众，在欢呼毛主席军事路线光辉胜利的同时，对中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿更加仇恨。他们用毛泽东思想作望远镜、显微镜，狠揭狠批这些走资本主义道路当权派的各种反动言行。荣获国防部命名的“航空兵英雄中队”的新老飞行员们，提出响亮的口号是：“空中狠揍美国狼，地上痛打‘落水狗’”。他们大揭大批彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下，反对毛主席的正确路线，反对毛主席的建军思想，妄图把我军引上资产阶级军队的道路，变成他们实行资本主义复辟的工具的罪行。他们愤怒地说：“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，他们的命运同一切反动派一样，是注定要彻底破产的。在革命战争年代中创建过功勋的山东军民，用自己的战斗经历作例子，愤怒声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿反对毛主席军事路线的滔天罪行。他们说：我们从来就是靠毛泽东思想打胜仗，靠无产阶级政治打胜仗。林副主席说，最大的战斗力是毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。这是千真万确的真理。他们表示，在轰轰烈烈的革命的大批判高潮中，彻底批判这一小撮阴谋家、野心家，是最大的历史任务，最大的政治责任，最大的为人民服务，我们一定要穷追猛打，把这些“落水狗”批倒斗垮，让他们永世不得翻身。
    通过大颂毛主席军事路线伟大胜利，大批中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内代理人的资产阶级军事路线，全国军民更加亲密团结，到处出现了军爱民，民拥军，军民团结，共同对敌的战斗气氛。
