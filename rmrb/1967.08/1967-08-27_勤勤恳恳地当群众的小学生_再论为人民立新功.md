	The broad masses of our army's officers and soldiers have enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist masses," in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. They have firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, fought shoulder to shoulder with them, established deep combat camaraderie, done a great deal of work, achieved tremendous results, and made active contributions. At the same time, they have also undergone strict tempering.

	This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a brand-new thing. The situation is developing rapidly, and the circumstances are complex. Therefore, some of our comrades' understanding often lags behind the situation. Their understanding of new problems varies, with some work done better than others, and some committing this or that error.

	In the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," the problem we often encounter is the relationship with the masses. Some handle this correctly, some handle it incorrectly, and some even handle it wrongly. Correctly handling the relationship with the masses is the key to our completing the glorious task of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries."

	Chairman Mao teaches us to diligently be the people's students. In this way, the masses will tell us anything they have to say, and we will know and understand all the situations. The style of our Communist Party is to stand among the masses, discuss and deliberate with them, and learn from them. That style of standing above the masses and issuing orders is the style of the Kuomintang.

	In completing the tasks of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," some comrades often cannot grasp the situation or see the problem clearly. How do we solve this problem? We must often go among the masses, respectfully learn from them, and investigate and study various different situations. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unprecedented, with countless new things and extremely complex situations. We cannot imagine there is only one situation. For example, regarding different mass organizations with differing opinions, do not just listen to one side's situation. Go to the masses on all sides, listen to their words, observe their actions, consult with them, and then return to collectively discuss. Do not just listen to one side's opinion and arbitrarily make judgments and express attitudes; this easily leads to errors. If after discussion the situation is still not clear, go back to the masses, go to the masses you have not been to, investigate, and study. Only by diligently learning from the masses, repeatedly making comparisons, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, can we seriously analyze and study. In this way, the understanding we gain will be more in line with the actual situation and more correct.

	By diligently learning from the masses, we can make fewer mistakes or no mistakes. If mistakes are made, they can be discovered and corrected early. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If mistakes are made, they should be corrected, and the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers discard errors, discard the spiritual shackles of the exploiting classes, which should be discarded. A Communist Party member or revolutionary soldier who does not discard errors, how can they be said to have participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? In the Cultural Revolution, in the glorious and arduous task of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," we encounter countless problems we have never encountered before. Therefore, it is inevitable that some comrades make mistakes. If we go among the masses, humbly learn from them, humbly listen to various different opinions, and consult with everyone on matters, we can make fewer mistakes. Even if mistakes are made, they can be easily discovered and corrected. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, learning from the masses is one of our glorious tasks. We must learn at all times. If one thinks they are the best and looks down on the masses without humbly learning from them, they will surely stumble and make mistakes. Making mistakes oneself is a small matter, but causing losses to the Party's cause and the people is a big matter.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should make every comrade understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and blend with them, then we can overcome any difficulty and no enemy can press us down; they will only be pressed down by us."

	The glorious history of our army's struggles eloquently proves this great truth.

	The people are the source of our army's strength. We are the people's children, coming from the people and for the people. The food we eat is grown by the masses, the clothes we wear are made by the masses, the houses we live in are built by the masses, and the weapons we use are made by the masses. At the same time, we constantly absorb political nourishment from the masses' revolutionary struggles and enrich ourselves. In short, we cannot do without the masses for a moment, just as fish cannot live without water for a moment.

	We must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seriously learn, learn at all times, closely connect with the masses, and closely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions. If we do not understand something or do not know how to do the work, we must consult the masses and consult Chairman Mao's works. Only in this way can we better complete the glorious task of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" given to us by Chairman Mao and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    勤勤恳恳地当群众的小学生
    ——再论为人民立新功
    我军广大指战员热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”工作中，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们并肩战斗，建立了深厚的战斗情谊，做了大量的工作，取得了巨大的成绩，作出了积极的贡献，同时，也受到了严格的锻炼。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命是一个崭新的事物。形势发展快，情况复杂。因此，我们一些同志的认识往往落后于形势。对新问题理解程度不同，有的工作做得好一些，有的工作做得差一些，有的犯了这样或那样的错误。
    我军在“三支”“两军”中，经常碰到的就是和群众的关系问题。对于这个问题，有的处理得正确，有的处理得不够正确，甚至也有的处理得错误。正确处理和群众的关系，是我们圆满完成“三支”“两军”光荣任务的关键。
    毛主席教导我们，要勤勤恳恳地当群众的小学生。这样，群众有什么话，就会告诉我们，什么情况，我们都能知道，都能搞清楚。我们共产党的作风，就是站在群众当中，跟群众一起商量、讨论问题，向群众学习。那种站在群众的头上，发号施令的作风，是国民党的作风。
    在完成“三支”“两军”的任务中，有些同志常常弄不清情况，看不清问题。怎样解决这个问题呢？就是要经常到群众里面去，恭恭敬敬地向群众学习，把各种不同的情况调查研究清楚。无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的，有许许多多的新东西，情况非常复杂，不能够设想只有一种情况。比如说，对待不同意见的群众组织，不要只听一方面的情况，要到各个方面的群众中去，听他们的话，看他们的行动，向他们请教，然后回来大家集体讨论。不能只听一方面的意见，随便作出判断，表示态度，这样容易犯错误。如果经过讨论还弄不清楚，就再到群众中去，到没有到过的群众中去调查、去研究。只有勤勤恳恳地向群众学习，翻来复去作对照，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，认真分析研究，这样取得的认识，才能比较接近实际情况，比较正确。
    勤勤恳恳地向群众学习，就可以少犯错误或不犯错误。如果犯了错误，也容易及早发现，及时改正。毛主席教导我们说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们共产党员、革命战士，丢掉的是错误，是剥削阶级给我们的精神锁链，这是应该丢掉的。一个共产党员、革命战士，不丢掉错误，怎么能算参加了无产阶级文化大革命呢？在文化大革命中，在光荣而艰巨的“三支”“两军”任务中，我们遇到许许多多从来没遇到过的问题。因此，有些同志犯错误是难免的。如果我们到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，虚心听取各种不同的意见，遇事和大家商量，就可以使我们少犯错误。即使犯了错误，也容易发现和纠正。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，向群众学习，这是我们的一项光荣任务。要随时随地地学习。如果老子天下第一，自以为是，瞧不起群众，不虚心向群众学习，肯定会栽跟斗，犯错误。自己犯错误是小事，给党的事业给人民群众造成损失是大事。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”
    我军光辉的斗争历史，雄辩地证明了这一伟大真理。
    人民群众是我军力量的源泉。我们是人民的子弟兵，是来自人民，为了人民的。我们吃的粮食是群众种的，穿的衣服是群众做的，住的房子是群众盖的，用的武器是群众造的。同时，我们还不断地在群众的革命斗争中吸取政治营养，丰富自己。总之，我们一刻也离不开群众，就如同鱼一刻也离不开水一样。
    我们要在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，认真学习，随时随地地学习，紧密地联系群众，紧紧跟上毛主席的最新指示。不懂的事情，不知道怎样做工作，就要向群众请教，向毛主席著作请教。只有这样，才能够更好地完成毛主席交给我们的“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功。　（八月二十六日）
