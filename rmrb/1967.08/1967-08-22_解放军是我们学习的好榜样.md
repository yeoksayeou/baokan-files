Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," which is a great strategic slogan for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Implementing Chairman Mao's great call is an important guarantee for pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great People's Liberation Army (PLA) has responded most resolutely and swiftly to Chairman Mao's call. They have provided political and ideological support to the revolutionary masses, passing on to us the PLA's experiences in emphasizing politics and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have also passed on the PLA's fine traditions of upholding the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style to the revolutionary masses, as well as the PLA's high sense of organization and discipline. They have helped the revolutionary masses to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, and continuously overcome erroneous tendencies such as anarchism, factionalism, extremism, and individualism within our ranks. This has greatly promoted the revolution's great unity, promoted the revolution's "three-in-one combination," and established a new revolutionary order. In supporting industry and agriculture, the PLA has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," vigorously promoting revolution and production. They support in every way, using Mao Zedong Thought to support the revolutionary masses. This is the PLA's greatest "love for the people," and it is the greatest support for us revolutionary masses.

We revolutionary masses pledge to be models of "supporting the army and loving the people." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our support for the army means believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, and always taking the great People's Liberation Army as our exemplary model to learn from.

We must take the People's Liberation Army as our model, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We learn from the People's Liberation Army to resolutely execute and defend the policies and guidelines on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We actively carry out the great criticism, fight to the end with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and achieve new victories in the great criticism.

We learn from the People's Liberation Army to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome factionalism, anarchism, extremism, and oppose economism, and be models of overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit.

We learn from the People's Liberation Army to, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, redouble our efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and be the most outstanding models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

In a word, we must take the People's Liberation Army as our model, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest way to "support the army."

    解放军是我们学习的好榜样
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，是推进文化大革命的一个伟大的战略口号。贯彻毛主席的这一伟大号召，是把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进的重要保证。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的人民解放军最坚决最迅速地响应了毛主席的号召，他们从政治上、思想上支援无产阶级革命派，把解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的经验，传给了我们广大的无产阶级革命派；把解放军坚持四个第一、三八作风等优良传统，传给了广大无产阶级革命派；把解放军高度的组织性纪律性，传给了广大无产阶级革命派。并且帮助我们无产阶级革命派，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，破私立公，不断地克服自己队伍中的无政府主义、小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义等错误倾向，加速思想革命化，有力地促进了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”，建立了革命的新秩序。在支援工业、支援农业中，人民解放军坚决贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产。千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想支持革命派，这就是人民解放军最大的“爱民”，就是对我们无产阶级革命派最大的支援。
    我们无产阶级革命派，誓做“拥军爱民”的模范，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派的拥军，就是要相信和依靠人民解放军，就是要永远把伟大的人民解放军作为我们学习的榜样。
    我们要以人民解放军为榜样，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    我们学习人民解放军，就是要坚决执行和捍卫毛主席、党中央制定的关于无产阶级文化大革命的方针、政策，积极开展革命的大批判，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争到底，在革命的大批判中立新功。
    我们学习人民解放军，就是要努力认真地活学活用毛主席著作，克服小团体主义、无政府主义、风头主义，反对经济主义，作破私立公的模范。
    我们学习人民解放军，就是要在无产阶级文化大革命中，更加鼓足干劲、力争上游，作抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范。
    一句话，就是要以人民解放军为榜样，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这样做才是最大的“拥军”。
