South Vietnamese military and civilians in the southern regions launched fierce attacks on the enemy in July, annihilating and demoralizing nearly nine thousand enemy troops, including nearly three thousand American invaders.

In July, the military and civilians in the southern regions of South Vietnam also shot down, destroyed, or damaged 140 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 218 military vehicles, sank or damaged 57 military ships, captured 15 enemy outposts and watchtowers, and one military base, destroyed nearly 250 enemy barracks and tents, and five military warehouses, seizing and destroying a large amount of weapons and equipment.

The liberation armed forces in the eastern region of the south penetrated deep into enemy territory and launched fierce attacks on the American defense lines around Saigon. During the attacks on the enemy bases at Phu Lam, Tan Hiep, Phu Loi, and Lai Khe, the liberation armed forces annihilated more than 750 enemy troops, the majority of whom were American aggressors, destroying 28 heavy artillery pieces, 57 aircraft, two radar stations, and one missile launch pad.

While the main forces of the liberation armed forces were attacking enemy outposts, the guerrilla forces and local troops, with the assistance of the people, launched surprise attacks on the enemy-occupied towns of Thuan Duc, Bien Hoa, Xuan Loc, Duc Hoa, and Tra Vinh, annihilating hundreds of American and puppet troops.

The military and civilians in the eastern region of the south also cooperated with the military in the central region to cut off almost all enemy strategic transportation lines and annihilated a large number of enemy troops. On July 20, the liberation army in Bien Hoa Province ambushed American invaders on Highway 20, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops, destroying 40 military vehicles, and shooting down three enemy aircraft.

In July, the military and civilians in the central region of the south launched continuous attacks on the enemy on Highways 4, 6, and 7, as well as on the Mekong and Vam Co rivers, achieving outstanding results. In My Tho Province, the military and civilians fought more than ten battles in half a month, smashing the enemy's large "sweeping" operations to open this road, annihilating more than a thousand enemy troops, including 650 American invaders.

The military and civilians in the central region of the south also launched a series of attacks on many enemy "key pacification" areas and various enemy-occupied towns, annihilating nearly a thousand American and puppet troops, further frustrating the enemy's "pacification" plot in the Mekong Delta.

In July, the military and civilians in the western region of the south further developed guerrilla warfare, smashing the enemy's series of "sweeping" operations and continuously attacking enemy transportation lines, annihilating thousands of enemy troops.
