The brilliant works of Chairman Mao Zedong, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," have been published in Sinhala by the Colombo People's Press and have been warmly welcomed by the people of Ceylon. These two works by Chairman Mao were translated by Ananda Kumara, Secretary-General of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association.

The Ceylon Communist Party places great importance on propagating and studying Mao Zedong Thought among Ceylon Communist Party members and the revolutionary people of Ceylon. Last August, the Central Committee of the Ceylon Communist Party made a decision to promote the study of Mao Zedong Thought.

Since the beginning of last year, the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been translated into Sinhala, and some of Chairman Mao's brilliant works have also been translated into Sinhala or Tamil and published in Ceylon, such as: "On New Democracy," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Combat Liberalism," "On Practice," "The Communist," "The Preface and Postscript to 'Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan,'" and "Pay Attention to the Methods of Work and Care for the Masses' Livelihood."

The Tamil version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was recently published by the Colombo People's Press and has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of Ceylon.

Chairman Mao's brilliant works, known as the "Three Articles," have been translated into Urdu and published in the recent three issues of the weekly "Rock" in West Pakistan, Lahore. The latest issue of "Rock" also published some quotations from Chairman Mao on internationalism, along with an editorial note. The editorial note states that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist thinker and proletarian leader of our time. Chairman Mao, following Lenin, has made extraordinary contributions to the development of Marxism.

The editorial note states that translating and publishing Chairman Mao's quotations in Urdu is a heartening event for the people of Pakistan.

In Karachi, four brilliant works by Chairman Mao have recently been translated into Urdu and published. These four works are: "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Combat Liberalism." The publishers have written prefaces for these translations, introducing the outlines of each work and emphasizing the guiding significance of Chairman Mao's brilliant works for the revolutionary cause of the world's people.

The Urdu translations of four other brilliant works by Chairman Mao, "Serve the People," "On Practice," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?," and "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing," were published earlier in Karachi and have been warmly welcomed by the people of Pakistan.

The Urdu weekly "Voice of the Khyber" in Peshawar, West Pakistan, recently published Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Serve the People" with an editorial note.

The Arabic translation of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" has recently been published in Damascus and has been warmly welcomed by the people of Syria. The back cover of the book prints quotations from Chairman Mao: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people." "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses."

Many Syrian friends pointed out that Chairman Mao's teachings on people's war are the only correct path to defeating American imperialism and Zionism. This is the most powerful ideological weapon that Chairman Mao has given to the Arab people.

    光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀全世界
    《毛主席语录》“老三篇”等光辉著作在锡兰巴基斯坦叙利亚出版受到革命人民热烈欢迎
    本报综合报道　毛泽东主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的僧伽罗文版本，已经由科伦坡人民出版社出版，受到了锡兰人民的热烈欢迎。毛主席的这两篇著作是由锡中友好协会秘书长阿南达·库马拉翻译的。
    锡兰共产党对在锡共党员和锡兰革命人民中宣传和学习毛泽东思想极为重视。去年八月锡兰共产党中央委员会曾作出关于促进毛泽东思想的学习的决定。
    从去年初到现在，红色宝书《毛主席语录》已译成僧伽罗文，毛主席的一些光辉著作也已译成僧伽罗文或泰米尔文，并陆续在锡兰出版，如：《新民主主义论》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》、《实践论》、《〈共产党人〉发刊词》、《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。
    《毛主席语录》泰米尔文版最近由科伦坡人民出版社出版，受到锡兰革命人民的热烈欢迎。
    毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”已经译成乌尔都文，并在西巴基斯坦莱雅普尔出版的《顽石》周刊的最近三期上连续发表。《顽石》周刊最近一期同时刊登了毛主席关于国际主义问题的一些语录，并加了编者按。编者按说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义思想家和无产阶级领袖。毛主席继列宁之后，对发展马克思主义作出了非凡的贡献。
    编者按说，把毛主席语录译成乌尔都文并发表，这对巴基斯坦人民来说是一个振奋人心的事件。
    在卡拉奇，毛主席的四篇光辉著作最近被译成乌尔都文出版。这四篇著作是：《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》、《反对自由主义》。出版者分别给这几篇著作的译文写了前言，介绍各篇著作的概要，并强调指出了毛主席的光辉著作对世界人民革命事业的指导意义。
    毛主席的另外四篇光辉著作《为人民服务》、《实践论》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》的乌尔都文译本，早些时候已在卡拉奇出版，并受到巴基斯坦人民的热烈欢迎。
    西巴基斯坦白沙瓦的乌尔都文《开伯尔之声》周刊，在最近一期刊载了毛主席光辉著作《为人民服务》并加了编者按。
    毛主席的光辉著作《抗日游击战争的战略问题》阿拉伯文译本最近在大马士革出版，受到叙利亚人民的热烈欢迎。这本书的封面背后印着毛主席语录：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”。“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    许多叙利亚朋友指出，毛主席关于人民战争的教导，是打败美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的唯一正确道路。这是毛主席给予阿拉伯人民的最强大的思想武器。　（据新华社讯）
