Editor's Note: The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai, in the midst of the great criticism movement, have compiled their big-character posters into columns and posted them on the streets. These big-character poster columns are each sponsored by a unit or a revolutionary mass organization, have fixed locations, and are updated regularly. Millions of big-character posters are fiercely attacking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Shanghai. This is a new phenomenon in the great criticism movement, a good form for the great criticism movement to be carried out both vigorously and thoroughly.

The big-character poster columns on the streets of Shanghai reflect the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Shanghai. They play a major role in spreading the great and boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong, in thoroughly overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and in exposing the heinous crimes of these counter-revolutionary revisionists to the people, and in cleansing the poison of revisionism they have spread on all fronts.

Running the street big-character poster columns for the great criticism movement is a serious political task. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought, emphasize proletarian politics, raise the political quality of the criticism, and strengthen the propaganda effect of the criticism. Many of the revolutionary big-character poster columns on the streets of Shanghai have clear viewpoints, rich content, and both words and pictures. They truly possess the "fighting style that the revolutionary proletariat should have."

Let us post more high-quality revolutionary big-character posters for the great criticism movement on the streets and further unleash the combat power of this extremely useful new weapon in the great criticism movement!

The Voice of a Blood-Sucking Vampire

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road shamelessly praises capitalists, saying that "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation is glorious," and that "the exploitation of capitalists is a historical merit that will never be forgotten." They talk nonsense about how "capitalists also serve the people," and that "the more they exploit, the greater their merit, and the more glorious they are." They also shout, "The working people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it." "Mr. Capitalist, I beg you to exploit me. If you exploit me, I will have food to eat, and my wife and children will be able to live. If you do not exploit me, it will be disastrous!" "Workers want you to exploit them, otherwise they will suffer greatly." ... Hearing these black words, my lungs are about to burst with anger! This is a great insult to our working class. This is a dream of restoring capitalism in China, making us suffer twice. We, the working class, will not agree to this, not even a little bit!

In the old society, we, the working class, suffered enough from the exploitation and oppression of imperialism, capitalism, and feudalism. Today, when we recall the bitter life of the past, our hearts burn with indignation. Thirty years ago, I was only thirteen years old. Because my father was sick, there was nothing to eat at home, and a neighbor introduced me to work as a child laborer at the British imperialist's "Yihe Company." The job was picking duck feathers, working twelve hours a day, and the wage was only twenty copper coins. The workshop was full of dust and sand, and one could hardly open one's eyes. Many workers inhaled the dust into their lungs, got tuberculosis, and were kicked out by the imperialist boss. Some workers died soon after returning home. In the factory, after we picked the duck feathers and packaged them, we still had to load them onto the ship. Some workers accidentally fell into the Huangpu River, and the British capitalists and their lackeys would drag them up and beat them up.

Birds of a feather flock together. Foreign capitalists are like this, and Chinese capitalists are also like this. Which capitalist does not fatten himself with the blood and sweat of workers? Under the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeoisie, how many of our class brothers have suffered family destruction, separation of spouses, and loss of children! The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road talks nonsense about how "if there are more capitalists and more exploitation, then we will feel more comfortable." This is truly the voice of a blood-sucking vampire! What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, imperialists, modern revisionists, capitalists, and labor traitors are all of the same breed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. As we all know, reactionaries use all kinds of means to combat revolution. They have jails, concentration camps, various kinds of weapons, etc. But in the last analysis, all this depends on the people's support. Stand up for revolution? They dare not. Oppose revolution? Their foundation is fragile. As we say in China, 'The emperor has no clothes.' ... The people have the power; the people are everything." We must respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, cleanse the poison of revisionism he has spread in all aspects, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

专栏：

    编者按　上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在革命大批判高潮中，把大批判的大字报汇集成专栏，贴上街头。这些大字报专栏，各由一个单位或一个革命群众组织主办，固定位置，定期更换。千万张大字报，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人，猛烈开火。这是革命大批判中的新事物，是革命大批判既轰轰烈烈又深入扎实地开展起来的好形式。
    上海街头的大字报专栏，反映了上海无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。对于传播伟大的光焰无际的毛泽东思想，对于从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对于在人民群众中揭露这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的滔天罪行，肃清他们在各条战线上散布的修正主义流毒，起着重大的作用。
    办好街头革命大批判大字报专栏，是一项严肃的政治任务，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，提高批判的政治质量，加强批判的宣传效果。上海街头的许多革命大字报专栏，观点鲜明，内容丰富，图文并茂，真正具有“革命无产阶级应有的战斗风格”。
    让我们把更多的高质量的革命大批判的大字报贴上街头，在革命的大批判中进一步发挥这种极其有用的新式武器的战斗威力吧！
    这是十足的吸血鬼的声音
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，无耻地颂扬资本家“剥削有功”，“剥削光荣”，“资本家的剥削是有历史功绩的，这个功绩是永垂不朽的”；胡说“资本家也是为人民服务”的，他们“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣。”他还叫嚷什么：“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”“资本家先生，我请求你剥削一下吧，剥削我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去，如果不剥削，就不得了！”“工人要你剥削，不剥削人家就苦得很。”……听了这些黑话，我的肺都气炸了！这是对我们工人阶级的莫大侮辱，这是梦想在中国搞资本主义复辟，叫我们吃二遍苦。我们工人阶级一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    在旧社会，我们工人阶级吃足了帝国主义、资本主义和封建主义剥削、压迫的苦头，今天回忆起过去的苦难生活，心里就会燃起万丈怒火。三十年前，我才十三岁，因为父亲生病，家里没有吃的，由邻居介绍我到英帝国主义的“礼和洋行”做童工，干的是拣鸭毛的活儿，一天要工作十二小时，工资只有二十个铜板，工房里都是灰沙，连眼睛都睁不大开。有很多工人因灰沙吸到肺里，生了肺病，被帝国主义的老板一脚踢开，有的工人回家没多久就死了。我们在工厂里，拣好了鸭毛，包好以后，还要朝船上装。有的工人不小心掉到黄浦江里，英国资本家和他们豢养的走狗还要把你拖上来拳打脚踢。
    天下乌鸦一般黑，外国资本家是这样，中国资本家也是这样，有哪一个资本家不是用工人的血汗养肥自己的？！在资产阶级的剥削压榨下，我们有多少阶级兄弟家破人亡，妻离子散啊！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派胡说什么“如果资本家多了，剥削多了，那么，我们就越感到舒服。”真是十足的吸血鬼的声音！什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和帝国主义者、现代修正主义者、资本家、工贼等都是一类货色。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”我们一定要响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，高举革命批判的大旗，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，肃清他在各方面散布的修正主义流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
