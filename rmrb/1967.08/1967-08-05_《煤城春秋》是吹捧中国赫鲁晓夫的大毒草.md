The largest capitalist-roader in the Party has been distorting history for many years, portraying himself as the leader of the Anshan Strike and whitewashing his traitorous and counter-revolutionary face, while erasing the great achievements of Chairman Mao. The long novel "Coal City Chronicles" is a poisonous weed that praises China's Khrushchev.

The reactionary novel "Coal City Chronicles" began to take shape as early as 1960, originally planned to be written in three volumes. The author intended to make it a "history of the Chinese workers' movement," portraying the largest capitalist-roader in the Party as the "leader" of the Chinese workers' movement. The first volume, "The Initial Battle," was completed in December 1964. The capitalist-roader in the People's Literature Publishing House considered it a treasure and immediately included it as one of the key items in their publishing plan, even assigning someone to revise the manuscript. In March 1966, the novel was revised to its third draft.

"The Initial Battle" was written based on the reactionary film "Sparking the Prairie Fire," with similar reactionary content. Like "Sparking the Prairie Fire," it vigorously advocates for "peaceful negotiations," opposes armed struggle; it relentlessly promotes "labor-capital cooperation," opposes class struggle; it vigorously elevates "economic struggle," opposes political struggle; it maliciously defames the working class and shamelessly beautifies warlords and bureaucratic capitalists.

In the novel, Lei Huanjue is the embodiment of the largest capitalist-roader in the Party. The author describes Lei Huanjue as someone who, "in his high school days, was already deeply concerned about the political corruption, social darkness, people's suffering, and national peril of the country. He harbored a 'the country's rise and fall, every individual has a responsibility' patriotic heart, tirelessly seeking the truth of saving the country and the people," and "devoted himself to the proletarian revolutionary cause of saving the country from harm and liberating the people from suffering"; and that Lei Huanjue, "to dedicate himself to the labor movement," completely "rebelled against his father's (decayed landlord) expectations and teachings." In the novel, the largest capitalist-roader in the Party appears as a "modest and diligent," "young and promising" revolutionary.

In reality, the largest capitalist-roader in the Party, who comes from a decayed landlord family, has never been concerned about the country and its people. Instead, he has always been eager to stand out and bring glory to his ancestors. In 1921, the year before the largest capitalist-roader in the Party went to Anshan, he wrote on the back of a photograph of his sworn brother: "Your life is short and strange, how can you expect a life of wealth and honor? Why not enjoy yourself while you can, wandering a thousand miles, facing countless difficulties, what is the use?" These lines of poetry fully expose his filthy soul of pursuing wealth and pleasure. How can a playboy who is obsessed with enjoying himself be concerned about the country and its people? In 1960, the largest capitalist-roader in the Party even admitted: "We joined the Party because we saw that our personal problems could not be solved, so we first solved the national interests. When the national and social problems are solved, everyone's interests will be improved, and personal interests will also be improved." This sentence reveals his ugly face. As for the claim that the largest capitalist-roader in the Party resolutely cut ties with his family, this is all nonsense. Until 1949, the largest capitalist-roader in the Party was still writing letters to advise his landlord relatives on how to exploit peasants and resist land reform. He always stood on the side of the landlord bourgeoisie, vigorously promoting the fallacies of "exploitation is justified" and "exploitation is meritorious," attempting to restore capitalism.

"The Initial Battle" shamelessly distorts history, attributing the great victory of the Anshan Strike, which was personally led by Chairman Mao, entirely to the largest capitalist-roader in the Party. In reality, during the strike, the largest capitalist-roader in the Party betrayed the working class, catering to the needs of the capitalists, using "diplomacy first, force later" as an excuse, and engaging in compromise and surrender, "peaceful negotiations."

In the first draft, the author still wrote about some instructions from Chairman Mao regarding the Anshan Strike, referring to them as "Comrade Runzhi" doing this and that. However, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists have extreme hatred for our great leader Chairman Mao. They fear the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and do not allow the appearance of Chairman Mao's glorious image in artistic works. They first changed "Comrade Runzhi" to "responsible comrade of the higher-level party committee," but they were still afraid that people would recognize that this "responsible comrade" is our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, with a stroke of the pen, they erased the words "responsible comrade." Thus, in the third draft revised in March 1966, "Comrade Runzhi" was completely changed to the vague "higher-level party committee." As for the specific instructions of this higher-level party committee regarding the strike, the novel hesitates and does not explain. However, it emphasizes Lei Huanjue's wisdom, decisiveness, cleverness, and bravery everywhere. Their wolfish ambitions are evident!

What is intolerable is that "The Initial Battle" portrays China's Khrushchev as the embodiment of the "Party." This is the greatest slander against the Chinese Communist Party, which was founded by Chairman Mao. The author carefully praises the largest capitalist-roader in the Party in the book, portraying him as the "leader" of the masses, the "helm" of the revolution, and the "guide" of the working class. The name "Lei Huanjue" means "a thunderous roar awakens the consciousness of the working class." The novel describes that when workers seek the Communist Party, "Lei Huanjue's handsome and friendly face" slowly appears before them. After hearing Lei Huanjue's "truth," Old Yi feels that "in front of him, there seems to be a brilliant red light leading the way, and behind him, there seems to be a thunderous footsteps following, as if he is not walking alone, but with thousands and millions of suffering workers and peasants, following the brilliant red light in front—the Communist Party (referring to the largest capitalist-roader in the Party), advancing on the road of smashing the old world and building a new world." Here, it seems that it is not our great leader Chairman Mao, but the largest capitalist-roader in the Party leading the working class in the great struggle to change the world. Their intentions are so malicious!

There is also a scene in the novel where Lei Huanjue wants to go to the city to pay his respects to the county magistrate, and the workers want to carry him in a sedan chair. Lei pretends not to sit. When the workers say, "We are not carrying you, but the Party," Lei Huanjue then sits on the sedan chair, allowing the workers to carry him into the city to pay his respects to the county magistrate. The reactionary novel "The Initial Battle" defames the working class and beautifies the largest capitalist-roader in the Party to such an astonishing extent! There is also a scene: "Twenty members of the protection team all kneel on the ground," swearing to heaven, "We twenty people swear to protect our backbone of 13,000 people. As long as we have a breath of life, we will not let the demons touch a hair on Lei Director's body. If we have any other intentions, may we be struck by heaven and earth." Lei Huanjue feels that "everyone's love for him" is indeed "not a personal matter, but a reflection of the working class's great trust and love for the Party." Truly, they do not know what shame is!

"I am the 'Party,' the 'Party' is me." This is the entire inner world of the largest capitalist-roader in the Party. We cannot help but ask: What kind of party is this?! The "Party" that you boast about is definitely not the glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao, but a small group of genuine "saviors" riding on the heads of the people and personal ambitionists.

The most malicious part of this reactionary novel is that it relentlessly advocates for the largest capitalist-roader in the Party to take power, urging people to follow him for generations.

The book repeatedly says: "Only when the workers follow Mr. Lei will there be a future." Then comes a series of priest-like admonitions: Following Lei Huanjue, "this is the path that every worker, every person with a sense of justice should take. If you are truly a man with blood and bones, with a sense of righteousness," you should "wholeheartedly follow Mr. Lei." Then they swear to their master: "Director Lei, we will wholeheartedly follow you, shedding blood and beheading, without flinching!" And they want their descendants to follow the path led by Lei Huanjue. Finally, they shout at the top of their lungs: "Quickly bring out our Director Lei," "Director Lei... issue an order, lead everyone to do it!"

This is the arrogant call of counter-revolutionaries! The Chinese people and the people of the world revolution deeply understand: Navigating the vast sea requires a helmsman. Only by closely following Chairman Mao and using the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought can we move from victory to victory. The reactionary novel "The Initial Battle" sings a different tune, with one "bring out our Director Lei" on the left and one "follow Mr. Lei" on the right. Their goal is to elevate China's Khrushchev to the position of leader and create public opinion for him to seize the Party and the government. We must see through this conspiracy, expose this conspiracy, and resolutely smash this conspiracy.

### 《煤城春秋》是吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的大毒草

    《煤城春秋》是吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的大毒草
    人民文学出版社“革命造反团”　北师大井冈山中联“奔腾急”战斗队　北师院东方红鲁迅兵团
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派多年以来，颠倒历史，以安源大罢工的领导者自居，为他的叛徒工贼嘴脸涂脂抹粉，一笔抹煞毛主席的伟大功绩。长篇小说《煤城春秋》就是一株吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的大毒草。
    反动小说《煤城春秋》早在一九六○年就开始酝酿，原计划写三大部。作者要把它写成一部“中国工人运动史”，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派写成中国工人运动的“领袖”。它的第一部《最初的战斗》于一九六四年十二月写出初稿。人民文学出版社党内走资本主义道路当权派如获至宝，立即把它列为出版计划的重点之一，并派专人替作者修改稿件。一九六六年三月，小说改定第三稿。
    《最初的战斗》是在反动电影《燎原》的基础上写成的，反动内容大致一样。象《燎原》一样，它大肆宣扬“和平谈判”，反对武装斗争；拚命鼓吹“劳资合作”，反对阶级斗争；竭力抬高“经济斗争”，反对政治斗争；恶毒丑化工人阶级，恣意美化军阀、官僚资本家。
    小说中的雷唤觉，就是中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的化身。作者在作品中说什么雷唤觉“在中学时代就开始为祖国政治的腐败，社会的黑暗，人民的苦难，国家的危亡而忧心如焚。他怀着一颗‘国家兴亡，匹夫有责’的赤子之心，孜孜不倦地追求过救国救民的真理”，“从事着挽救祖国危害、解放人民苦难的无产阶级革命事业”；说什么雷唤觉“为了献身劳工运动”，完全“叛逆了父亲（破落地主）的期望和教诲”。在小说中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，俨然成了一个“不务虚华，埋头苦干”，“年轻有为，鹏程志远”的革命家。
    实际上，出身于破落地主家庭的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，从来就没有“忧国忧民”，相反地，他一心只想出人头地，光宗耀祖。一九二一年，即党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派去安源的前一年，在给他的把兄弟的照片背面，写有一首黑诗，内有这样四句：“尔之命促数且奇，一生富贵何可期，胡不及时以行乐，飘零千里，备罹万难欲何为？”这几句诗充分暴露了他追求富贵行乐的肮脏灵魂。一个醉心于及时行乐的纨绔子弟，怎么能够“忧国忧民”呢？一九六○年，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派还不打自招地说：“我们加入党是看到个人问题横竖解决不了，先解决国家利益，国家社会问题解决了，随着大家的利益的提高，个人的利益也会提高。”一句话画出了他的丑恶嘴脸。至于说到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派毅然和家庭划清界限，这完全是骗人的鬼话。直到一九四九年，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，还写信为其地主亲属出谋定计，教给他们如何盘剥农民、对抗土改。他始终站在地主资产阶级立场上，大肆宣扬“剥削有理”“剥削有功”的谬论，妄图复辟资本主义。
    《最初的战斗》肆无忌惮地篡改历史，把毛主席亲自领导下安源大罢工的伟大胜利，全部记在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的头上。实际上，罢工中间，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛工人阶级，迎合资本家的需要，以“先礼后兵”为借口，大搞妥协投降、“和平谈判”。
    在第一稿中，作者还勉强写到一些毛主席对安源罢工的指示，提法是“润芝同志”如何如何。但是，一小撮反革命修正主义分子，极端仇恨我们的伟大领袖毛主席。他们害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想，不准艺术作品中出现毛主席的光辉形象。他们先把“润芝同志”改为“上级党委负责同志”，又怕人们看出这个“负责同志”就是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，于是大笔一挥，抹掉了“负责同志”四个字。这样，在一九六六年三月改定的第三稿中“润芝同志”全被改成笼统的“上级党委”了。至于这个上级党委，究竟对罢工有何具体指示，小说中也吞吞吐吐，不作交代。但是，却处处突出雷唤觉英明、果断、机智、勇敢。其狼子野心，昭然若揭！
    令人不能容忍的是，《最初的战斗》把中国的赫鲁晓夫写成了“党”的化身。这是对毛主席亲手缔造的中国共产党的最大污蔑。作者在书中苦心孤诣地吹捧党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把他说成是群众的“领袖”，革命的“舵手”，工人阶级的“带路人”。“雷唤觉”的名字，就是“一声春雷唤起工人阶级的觉悟”的含义。小说写道，当工人想寻找共产党时，“雷唤觉那张英俊而又亲切的面孔”，就“慢慢出现在他眼前”。听了雷唤觉的“真言”之后，易老倌子“感到前头好象有灿烂的红光带路，背后好象有隆隆的脚步跟随，仿佛不是自己一个人在走路，而是有千千万万的受苦工农兄弟，和自己一起，跟着前面带路的灿烂的红光——共产党（按指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派），在向着粉碎旧世界，缔造新世界的战斗大道上前进”。这里，似乎不是我们的伟大领袖毛主席，而是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派领导着工人阶级从事翻天覆地的伟大斗争。其用心何其毒也！
    小说还有这样一个情节：雷唤觉要进城拜见县太爷，工人们要用轿送他。雷假意不坐。当工人说，我们不是抬你，是抬党时，雷唤觉便心安理得地坐上轿子，让工人抬着进城拜会县太爷去了。反动小说《最初的战斗》丑化工人阶级，美化党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派达到何等惊人的程度！还有这样一个场面：“二十个保卫团员都一齐跪在地上”，“对天盟誓，表示决心”：“苍天在上，我们二十个人誓死保卫我们一万三千人的主心骨儿。只要救得我们一口气在，就不能让恶鬼们动我们雷主任身上一根汗毛。若有异心，天诛地灭。”雷唤觉觉得“大家对他的这样爱护”，“的确不是个人问题，而是流露了工人阶级对党的巨大信任和爱护的浓烈感情”。真是不知天下有羞耻事！
    我就是“党”，“党”就是我。这就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的全部内心世界。我们不禁要问：你算是什么党？！你所自诩的“党”，决不是以毛主席为首的光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党，而是一小撮货真价实的骑在人民头上的“救世主”和个人野心家。
    这部反动小说最恶毒的地方，在于它拚命鼓吹让党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派上台，要人们“子孙万代”跟着他走。
    书中喋喋不休地说：“只有劳工们跟着雷先生走，那才是有奔头的。”然后是一连串的牧师式的训诫：跟着雷唤觉，“这是每个工人，每个有正义之心的人都应该走的路子。你要真是个有血气的汉子，有义气的硬骨头”，就要“死心塌地地跟着雷先生走”。接着又向其主子宣誓：“雷主任，我们死心塌地地跟着你走，流血砍头，誓不皱眉！”并要他们的“子孙后代”走雷唤觉“引的路子”。最后，他们声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么：“快请我们的雷主任出来”，“雷主任……你发个号令，领着大家干吧！”
    这是狂妄的反革命叫嚣！中国人民和世界革命人民深深懂得：大海航行靠舵手，只有紧紧跟着毛主席，只有运用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，才能从胜利走向胜利。反动小说《最初的战斗》却大唱反调，左一个“请我们的雷主任出来”，右一个“跟着雷先生走”，其目的是要把中国的赫鲁晓夫捧上领袖的地位，为他篡党篡政大造舆论。我们必须识破这个阴谋，戳穿这个阴谋，坚决粉碎这个阴谋。
