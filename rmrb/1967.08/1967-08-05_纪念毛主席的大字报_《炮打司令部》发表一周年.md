Last year, at the historic and epoch-making Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters."

Chairman Mao's big-character poster said: "The first big-character poster and the editorial of the People's Daily, both of which are Marxist-Leninist in nature, are written so well! I urge comrades to read them again. However, for over fifty days, from the central to the local levels, some leading comrades have done the opposite. They have stood on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, practiced bourgeois dictatorship, suppressed the vigorous proletarian cultural revolution, distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, encircled the revolutionary factions, suppressed dissenting opinions, and imposed white terror. They thought they were triumphant, boosting the prestige of the bourgeoisie and undermining the spirit of the proletariat. How poisonous it all was! Linking this to the rightist deviation in 1962 and the 'left' but actually rightist deviation in 1964, is it not a profound lesson?"

Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" exposed the struggle between the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev within our Party. It delivered a powerful critique of China's Khrushchev, pointing out the main direction of the struggle for the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses, and providing the most powerful ideological weapon. It is a powerful and invincible spiritual atomic bomb aimed at China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois headquarters he leads, a declaration of war and a call to arms for the proletariat to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" is another great "signal gun" that opens a new era in human history. The Paris Commune's cannon shot was an attempt by the international proletariat to seize political power. The great teacher Lenin's October Revolution's cannon shot established the world's first proletarian dictatorship. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" fired a decisive shot in the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, ensuring our Party and country's eternal inviolability. This is a shot that destroys the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, ensuring that our Party and country will never change color.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to further solve the issue of political power, to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and to prevent capitalist restoration.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the most fundamental issue in preventing capitalist restoration is to ensure the absolute leadership of Chairman Mao's headquarters and prevent China's Khrushchev from seizing the leadership of the Party and the state. If China's Khrushchev's plot to usurp the Party and the state succeeds, our Party will become a revisionist party, China will change color, and there will be a great historical setback. Thus, the laboring people will have to take up arms again to seize political power and pay a greater price. Our great teacher Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," timely solving this most fundamental and crucial issue. This is a matter of the utmost importance concerning our country's destiny and the future of the world revolution, the most important achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past year, under the battle call of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have launched continuous attacks on the bourgeois headquarters, riding the winds and breaking the waves, advancing bravely, and achieving tremendous victories. The time bomb buried in the Party Central Committee, China's Khrushchev, and his lackeys have been exposed. Their long-standing crimes of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought have been exposed. Their plot to restore capitalism has been smashed. With the advance of the struggle, the Chinese people's thinking has also undergone a tremendous change. The proletarian revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is becoming stronger and more invincible.

Currently, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has entered the decisive stage. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, the vast cultural revolution army is on the verge of final victory. The bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev is crumbling. However, we must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." China's Khrushchev is making a desperate struggle, attempting to reverse the verdict and restore their lost "paradise."

The facts of class struggle tell us that the bourgeois headquarters has not been completely destroyed and is still putting up a last-ditch resistance. We must closely follow the strategic deployment of the great commander Chairman Mao, launch a vigorous revolutionary criticism, adhere to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters," and "pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage." We must carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and continuous combat. We must form a revolutionary criticism army of hundreds of millions of people, aiming at China's Khrushchev, the bourgeois headquarters, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to wage a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. We must truly overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly uproot the bourgeois headquarters.

Fundamentally, revolutionary criticism is to thoroughly criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology and the bourgeois reactionary line; to thoroughly establish and uphold Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. We must, in the course of criticism, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, analyze everything, criticize everything, and transform everything. We must strive to master Mao Zedong Thought in this great criticism.

"Awaken the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, and unite to do it." Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and the broad cadres and soldiers of our army, in this great and magnificent revolutionary criticism, you must take the lead and be in the forefront, thoroughly overthrow and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, thoroughly overthrow and expose the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly overthrow and expose the bourgeois military line.

The tide of history is irresistible. We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the theory, line, policy, and principles proposed by Chairman Mao for revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. We will surely thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus and eliminate all their poisonous influences. Our cause will surely achieve complete victory. We will surely build a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought.

Let us, with the resolute determination and actual actions to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of our great commander Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters."

### 纪念毛主席的大字报——《炮打司令部》发表一周年

    纪念毛主席的大字报——《炮打司令部》发表一周年
    去年，在具有伟大划时代意义的党的八届十一中全会上，我们伟大的统帅毛主席，发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报。
    毛主席的大字报说：“全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读一遍这张大字报和这个评论。可是在五十多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”
    毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，揭开了我们党内以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部和以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部斗争的盖子，对中国的赫鲁晓夫进行了最有力的批判，为无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众指出了斗争的主攻方向，提供了最强大的思想武器。它是射向中国的赫鲁晓夫和以他为首的资产阶级司令部的强大的、威力无穷的精神原子弹，是无产阶级向资产阶级发起全面反击的宣战书和动员令。
    毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，是又一声开辟人类历史新纪元的伟大“号炮”。巴黎公社一声炮响，作了国际无产阶级夺取政权的尝试。伟大的导师列宁领导的十月革命一声炮响，创立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家。我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，发出了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命，取得决定性胜利的一炮，这是摧毁隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部的一炮，是保证我们党和国家千秋万代永不变色的一炮。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，也就是为了进一步解决政权问题，解决巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的问题。
    在无产阶级专政的条件下，防止资本主义复辟最根本的问题，就是要保证毛主席的司令部的绝对领导权，防止中国的赫鲁晓夫式的人物即资产阶级司令部篡夺党和国家的领导权。如果让中国的赫鲁晓夫篡党篡国的阴谋得逞，我们的党就要变成修正主义的党，中国就要改变颜色，就要造成世界历史的大倒退。这样，劳动人民要想得到彻底解放，就得重新拿起枪杆子夺取政权，就要付出更大的代价。我们伟大导师毛主席写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，及时地解决了这个最根本、最要害的问题。这是关系到我国国家命运和世界革命前途的头等重要的大事，是无产阶级文化大革命的最重要的成果。
    一年来，在毛主席《炮打司令部》的战斗召唤下，广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众向资产阶级司令部发动了连续的攻击，乘风破浪，勇猛向前，取得了翻天覆地的伟大胜利。埋在党中央的定时炸弹、中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的娄罗们被揪出来了。他们长期以来与毛主席司令部分庭抗礼，反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行被揭露出来了。他们复辟资本主义的阴谋被粉碎了。随着斗争的胜利前进，我国人民的思想也发生了翻天覆地的变化，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命大军，越来越强大，越来越无敌。
    当前，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，已经进入决战阶段。以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，指挥着浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，正在夺取最后的胜利。以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部正在土崩瓦解。但是，我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”中国的赫鲁晓夫正在进行垂死挣扎，妄想翻案，妄想恢复他们失去的“天堂”。
    阶级斗争的事实告诉我们，资产阶级司令部还没有彻底摧毁，还在那里负隅顽抗。我们一定要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，开展轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，遵循毛主席《炮打司令部》指引的方向，“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风。我们要组成亿万人的革命批判大军，对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，对准资产阶级司令部，对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”，真正从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批臭，彻底挖掉资产阶级司令部的根基。
    革命的大批判，从根本上说，就是大破特破资产阶级思想，大破特破资产阶级反动路线；大立特立毛泽东思想，大立特立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在我们的头脑里树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们必须在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，分析一切，批判一切，改造一切。我们一定要在这场大批判中努力掌握毛泽东思想。
    “唤起工农千百万，同心干”。无产阶级革命派的战友们，我军广大指战员同志们，要在这场轰轰烈烈的革命大批判中，当先锋、打头阵，彻底地批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，彻底地批倒批臭资产阶级反动路线，彻底地批倒批臭资产阶级军事路线。
    历史的潮流是不可阻挡的。我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有毛主席为我们提出的在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策。我们一定能彻底摧毁隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部，肃清他们的一切流毒。我们的事业一定能彻底胜利。我们一定能建立一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
    让我们以彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的战斗决心和实际行动，来纪念我们伟大统帅毛主席的大字报《炮打司令部》发表一周年。
    （八月五日）
