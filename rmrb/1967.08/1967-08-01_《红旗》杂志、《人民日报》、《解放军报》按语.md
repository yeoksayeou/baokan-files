	*Red Flag* Magazine, *People's Daily*, and *PLA Daily* Commentary:

	To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we are publishing Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war.

	Mao Zedong's theory on people's war is an important component of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. Most importantly, it is essential to arm oneself with Mao Zedong's theory on people's war, to use the gun to smash the old state machine, to use the gun to overthrow imperialism and its lackeys, and to use the gun to transform the entire world.

	After the proletariat seizes power and throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there is a constant struggle between the proletariat to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The bourgeoisie, in order to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, will always seize guns through representatives within the party. In the Soviet Union, the Khrushchev revisionist clique seized military power and carried out a counter-revolutionary coup, which is a serious lesson. In our country, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, over the past 17 years, has colluded with the great conspirator, the great schemer, and the great warlord Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and has frantically carried out conspiracies to seize the military, attempting to turn our people's army into a tool for their counter-revolutionary restoration. Imperialism, led by the United States, attempts to invade and subvert socialist countries. Therefore, the revolutionary masses of socialist countries must also seriously study Chairman Mao's theory on people's war, master this sharp ideological weapon to smash capitalist restoration plots, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, be vigilant against armed invasions by imperialism and its accomplices, ensure that the gun is firmly in the hands of the proletariat, and prevent revisionists from seizing military power and changing the nature of the proletarian army. This is the most important link in preventing capitalist restoration.

	In the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in our country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has played a great role as the pillar of proletarian dictatorship and has established new merits; at the same time, it has also undergone new education, tempering, and testing in this great revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's involvement in the local proletarian cultural revolution is the latest development of our great leader Mao Zedong's theory on building a proletarian revolutionary army.

	Today, reviewing Chairman Mao's theory on people's war is of great significance to the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country.

    《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》按语：
    为了纪念中国人民解放军建军四十周年，我们发表毛主席论人民战争的语录。
    毛主席关于人民战争的理论，是当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的一个重要的组成部分。
    毛泽东思想是当代一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的指南。最重要的，就是要用毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论来武装自己，用枪杆子来打碎旧的国家机器，用枪杆子来打倒帝国主义及其走狗，用枪杆子来改造整个世界。
    在无产阶级取得政权以后，在社会主义整个历史时期内，始终存在着无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政和资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政的斗争。资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政，总是要通过党内的资产阶级代表人物拚命地抓枪杆子。在苏联，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺军权，实行反革命政变，就是一个严重的教训。在我国，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了实行资本主义复辟，十七年来，他勾结大阴谋家、大野心家、大军阀彭德怀、罗瑞卿，疯狂地进行篡军的阴谋活动，妄图把我们人民的军队变成他们反革命复辟的工具。以美国为首的帝国主义妄图对社会主义国家进行侵略，进行颠覆活动。因此，社会主义国家的革命人民群众也必须认真地学习毛主席关于人民战争的理论，很好地掌握这个粉碎资本主义复辟阴谋，巩固无产阶级专政的最锐利的思想武器，时刻警惕帝国主义及其帮凶的武装侵略，保证枪杆子牢牢掌握在无产阶级手里，防止修正主义者篡夺军权，改变无产阶级军队的性质。这是避免资本主义复辟的最重要的环节。
    在我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，发挥了无产阶级专政支柱的伟大作用，建立了新的功劳；同时，也在这个大革命的风浪中，经受了新的教育、锻炼和考验。中国人民解放军介入地方的无产阶级文化大革命，这是我们伟大统帅毛主席建设无产阶级革命军队理论的最新发展。
    今天，重新温习毛主席关于人民战争的理论，对于全党全军和全国人民，具有极其重要的意义。
