China's Khrushchev is the most dangerous enemy of the proletarian dictatorship and the mortal foe of China's 500 million peasants. For many years, he has used his usurped power, cloaked in the guise of an "old revolutionary," to peddle capitalist goods in the countryside and dismantle the socialist collective economy everywhere. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Dazhai have, in order to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and uphold the socialist direction, engaged in a long, head-on struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi. Currently, the Cultural Revolution is deepening, and a new high tide of revolutionary criticism is sweeping the nation. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have taken up the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a mass movement of exposure, criticism, and struggle, and opening fire on China's Khrushchev. Revolutionary criticism is excellent! It is an important step in carrying the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and ensuring that our country advances victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

A Serious Struggle in the Cooperative Movement

Chairman Mao taught us as early as the Anti-Japanese War: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, with each family a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule and keeps the peasants themselves in eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize." Chairman Mao also said: "Only socialism can save China. There is no other way out." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have not read much of Chairman Mao's works, but we learn a sentence and apply it. These few sentences of Chairman Mao have been etched in our minds for many years. We have made up our minds that no matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, we will definitely walk the socialist path. From the establishment of mutual aid teams and cooperatives to the founding of people's communes, Dazhai has always been at the forefront.

As Chairman Mao foresaw long ago: "The agricultural cooperative movement, from the very beginning, has been a serious struggle of thought and politics. ... There will definitely be people who will not change until they die and are willing to go to see God with their granite heads." From the start of the agricultural cooperative movement, not only did the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements eagerly sing the tune of opposition, but the agents of the bourgeoisie who had infiltrated the Party and government also jumped out to oppose and sabotage. They collaborated to fan the wind and light the fire, set up barriers, and pour cold water, doing many evil deeds openly and secretly. All these bad people and bad deeds, we have now found out, had China's Khrushchev as their mastermind and the biggest saboteur of the agricultural cooperative movement.

It was this China's Khrushchev who, in 1951, when the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shanxi, following Chairman Mao's teachings, proposed to raise mutual aid teams to the level of agricultural cooperatives, gave us a blow to the head. In a report, he ranted: "...some people have proposed the following opinion: it is necessary to gradually shake, weaken, and ultimately negate the private ownership base, to raise agricultural production mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives, and use this new factor to 'overcome the spontaneous forces of the peasants.' This is an erroneous, dangerous, and utopian socialist thought in agriculture." Look, what a big hat! China's Khrushchev, full of bourgeois thoughts, spouts nonsense with his mouth, aiming to oppose socialism. Countless revolutionary martyrs shed blood and sacrificed their lives to eliminate private ownership and build socialism. Are we not going to weaken the private ownership base? Are we going to strengthen it instead? Are we not going to raise mutual aid teams to cooperatives? Are we going to retreat to individual farming instead? Have we not suffered enough from individual farming?

Here, I must mention what happened in Dazhai at that time. In the spring of 1952, we wholeheartedly demanded to raise mutual aid teams to the level of primary cooperatives. At that time, the county leadership heard from the province the black directives of China's Khrushchev. Although I ran to the county ten times, repeatedly reporting the urgent desire and demand of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to establish cooperatives, the county leaders still did not dare to approve it. It was not until 1953 that they approved our establishment of a cooperative. Our mutual aid team was a large team of 49 households, but the county only approved us to establish a cooperative of 30 households. What about the remaining 19 households? No one wanted to go back to the old road of individual farming. We had to keep two sets of accounts: one set of accounts to deal with the higher authorities, clearly reporting 30 households; another set of accounts for ourselves, secretly establishing a cooperative of 49 households. When it came to autumn distribution, we were still discovered by the county cadres and criticized. China's Khrushchev and the landlords and rich peasants in the countryside wear the same pants. They are as afraid of agricultural collectivization as bats are of sunlight. Of course, "opportunists who try to block the tide are almost everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable." Not only Dazhai, but even Shanxi, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the country, did not listen to China's Khrushchev but followed Chairman Mao's instructions to raise mutual aid teams to cooperatives and later achieved the collectivization of people's communes. China's Khrushchev is most afraid of weakening the private ownership base, but we insist on weakening it. Not only do we weaken it, but we also continuously create conditions to uproot this evil private ownership base.

It was this China's Khrushchev who, at the same time, raised the banner of "consolidating the new democratic order," advocating "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation is glorious," and promoting the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style of farming households, even setting targets to develop to 80% of farming households in a few years. This is him blatantly speaking from the standpoint of rich peasants, paving the way for the development of the rich peasant economy. I am a former long-term laborer. In the old society, I had nothing, but I saw and used many of the "landlord's" horses, plows, and carts. In my opinion, a household developing to have three horses, one plow, and one cart is not enough to be a landlord but is a rich peasant. Is China's Khrushchev not trying to revive the already overthrown landlords and rich peasants?

It was also this China's Khrushchev who, in 1955, when the high tide of agricultural collectivization came, severely cut down on agricultural cooperatives; in 1962, when the country encountered temporary economic difficulties, he attacked the Three Red Banners and promoted the "three selfs and one contract," spreading the wind of individual farming. Where there is wind, there are waves. Every black wind that China's Khrushchev blew, blew to Shanxi and also blew to Dazhai. Thanks to the great helmsman Chairman Mao, who issued instructions at every critical moment, we quickly saw through the enemy's tricks, withstood the wrong winds, and ensured the victory of the socialist collective economy, making China's Khrushchev's wild dream of developing and restoring capitalism in the countryside and making us poor and lower-middle peasants slaves again impossible to realize.

The Plot to Uproot the Dazhai Red Flag Completely Fails

Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat and will make their last struggles. The class enemies will definitely look for opportunities to show themselves." The facts prove that this is an absolutely true principle.

China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi, before the high tide of agricultural collectivization, consistently opposed agricultural socialist transformation and implemented a long-term policy of "preserving the rich peasant economy." After the basic completion of agricultural socialist transformation, they did everything possible to dismantle the socialist collective economy. They said things like the people's commune was established too early, the advanced cooperative was not as good as the primary cooperative, the contract responsibility system had advantages, and there was no need to fear the spread of capitalism, etc. However, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, "socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, throwing all obstacles behind its back." The country is advancing, Shanxi is advancing, and Dazhai is advancing! After the establishment of the people's commune in 1960, Dazhai Brigade encountered a severe drought rarely seen in history. As the saying goes, "Spring drought is hard to catch seedlings, summer drought is hard to bear, and autumn drought is hard to form grains." It was precisely at these three critical points that the Shanxi region suffered severe drought. But that year was the year Dazhai Brigade produced the most grain in its history, delivered the most grain to the state, and the commune members received the most grain. These facts powerfully prove that the people's commune has unparalleled superiority, prove the complete correctness of Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy, and prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a great material force to change heaven and earth. The continuous achievements of Dazhai Brigade on the socialist path have attracted the attention of the people across the country. Especially after the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," many comrades from many brother provinces, counties, and communes came to Dazhai for visits, and friends from various countries came to Dazhai in batches, which greatly encouraged the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the continuous victories of Dazhai Brigade have hurt China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi, impacting their line of revisionism in the agricultural front. They felt more and more that the Dazhai red flag was an obstacle to their activities of restoring capitalism in the countryside. Therefore, they regarded Dazhai as a thorn in their eye and a splinter in their flesh. The more Dazhai Brigade advanced and created new achievements and new experiences, the more they feared and eagerly opposed and sabotaged.

The evil activities of China's Khrushchev's agents in Shanxi against Dazhai accelerated from 1961. In that year, a newly appointed first secretary of the Xiyang County Committee, on the seventh day of his appointment, hurriedly led more than ten people to Dazhai to check the so-called "exaggeration" problem. When his wish was not fulfilled, he maliciously said that we underreported the land and forced us to lower the production, insisting that we report the actual yield of 620 jin per mu in 1960 as 580 jin; report the annual grain delivery to the state of 240,000 jin as 220,000 jin. They were so unreasonable to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, pouring cold water on the Dazhai red flag, and denying the superiority of the socialist collective economy.

In the winter of 1964, they again took the opportunity of the Four Clean-ups movement to attempt to uproot the Dazhai red flag, organizing and planning a farce. This time, the momentum was even stronger, the disturbance lasted longer, and the tricks were more numerous; at the same time, their true colors were more clearly and thoroughly exposed to the Dazhai masses.

The Four Clean-ups is a great socialist education movement. Chairman Mao set a series of correct lines, policies, and principles for the Four Clean-ups movement. The work team sent to Dazhai, which was controlled by a small clique of those who took the capitalist road within the original Provincial Party Committee, Regional Party Committee, and County Party Committee, did not implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line at all but loyally executed China's Khrushchev's reactionary line of "left" in form and right in essence. In the two months they stayed in Dazhai, they did not organize the masses and cadres to study Chairman Mao's works even once, but for a so-called "advanced experience" in rural Four Clean-ups that China's Khrushchev enthusiastically praised, they organized the masses and cadres to study more than twenty times. They did not approach the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres but specifically looked for those who had the most complaints about the grassroots cadres. Who had the most complaints about the cadres of Dazhai Brigade? Of course, the first were the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements under control. These fellows actively provided them with "materials" and became their main force for the Four Clean-ups. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres became their main targets of struggle and attack. They thus greatly boosted the prestige of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements and greatly dampened the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao said: "Any retrogressive behavior will have results contrary to the original wishes of the initiators. This is true in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, without exception." They did this, which from the opposite side educated us. Many people began to consider such questions: Who sent this work team? What did they come to do? More and more facts proved that the people who sent this work team and the people who directed this work team had ulterior motives. They did not come to help Dazhai and promote Dazhai but to destroy Dazhai and smear Dazhai. We fought a head-on struggle with this anti-Dazhai work team.

After the work team had done a bit of "rooting and linking" and "secret work," they labeled Dazhai as a brigade with serious problems. They spread the word everywhere: the Dazhai red flag was raised by deceit, "the Dazhai red flagpole has worms, and if the worms are not dug out, the red flag cannot be raised high." According to the intentions of China's Khrushchev, they seized the party and government power of Dazhai Brigade, and all the cadres were sidelined, with everything directed and controlled by them. In their attempt to smear and destroy Dazhai, they had the following "evidence":

They said: Dazhai is a mountainous and dry area, and the grain yield per mu is so high, so the land must have been underreported. To find the "black land," they created a miracle of land measurement nationwide, organizing a five-level land measurement team consisting of cadres from the province, region, county, commune, and neighboring brigades. With more than seventy people participating, they spent more than fifty days carefully measuring twice. The result was not only no additional land but also a few mu less than the number reported by Dazhai.

They said: If the land was not underreported, then the grain yield must be false. So they checked the accounts and household heads, and even weighed the remaining grain, but the grain yield was not short by a single jin.

They said: Several dozen households with several hundred mu of land could deliver 240,000 jin of grain to the state every year, which must be false. They went to the county grain bureau to check the accounts of grain delivered by Dazhai over the years, but still could not find any evidence of deceit.

One scheme failed, and another was hatched. They said: Dazhai Brigade did not deduct the moisture content of the grain, violating state policies. The high yield of Dazhai was mainly due to the illusion created by not deducting the moisture content. To find a basis for false charges, they again carried out "rooting and linking" secret work. They found a poor peasant household, with five people in the household, each actually receiving 560 jin of grain. The work team members, under the pretext of deducting the moisture content, calculated with discounts, telling this household that each person did not receive 560 jin but 230 jin. They used this method to incite the relationship between the commune members and the grassroots cadres, the collective, and the state, slandering the cadres of Dazhai Brigade as extremely evil. We did not compromise with such preposterous and confusing behavior. We said: Not deducting the moisture content is not only not a mistake of Dazhai but is actually a virtue. Because the grain is dried, not deducting the moisture content is reasonable. Precisely because we do not deduct the moisture content, we calculate based on the actual total yield and sell more grain to the state. The remaining grain belongs to the commune members, and they can distribute more or less as needed, so why deduct the moisture content? In the end, they had nothing to say. For this matter, we even asked them: Khrushchev of the Soviet Union slandered that China's Great Leap Forward had failed and the people's commune had gone wrong; he slandered that the Chinese people were in great difficulty, with five people wearing one pair of pants and drinking clear soup. You insist on deducting the moisture content of the actual yield, turning each person's actual 560 jin into 230 jin, which is not in line with Khrushchev's needs? Deducing the moisture content of the actual yield, keeping more for oneself, and selling less to the state, what good is this for socialist construction?

They still refused to admit defeat and took the management system of Dazhai Brigade, which canceled labor quotas and implemented the model worker labor points, as a crime. They said: This is "one-size-fits-all" without distinguishing between diligence and laziness, "does not conform to the principle of distribution according to work," and "is a system started by Chen Yonggui's speeches, not the will of the commune members." We refuted them with facts. After Dazhai Brigade implemented this model worker labor points and self-reporting system, the attendance rate increased, and labor efficiency also improved. Commune members who could do heavy work did heavy work, and those who could not do heavy work did light work, with almost no shirking or irresponsibility. In 1962, the year before this management system was implemented, the average number of labor days actually worked by men and women of all ages was 250 per year, 260 in 1963, and 280 in 1964. We said: This management system is good, led by Mao Zedong Thought, not by labor points. It embodies the principle of distribution according to work and is more reasonable and convenient than those cumbersome quota management methods. It is a creation by the commune members under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not something imposed on the masses by any cadre.

When they had to admit that the yield of Dazhai Brigade was real, the surplus grain sold to the state was indeed more, and the management was reasonable, they then found a "mistake" in the arrangement of the commune members' lives. They said that Dazhai produced a lot of grain, but the commune members did not eat well. We answered them: First, we do not eat very well. However, compared to the past, it is much better. Second, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have worked hard and relied on their own efforts to develop production, not for themselves, but to support socialist construction and the world revolution. If we produced for ourselves to eat well and not to sell surplus grain to the state, we could eat the grain we harvested in one year for three years. However, this is not what socialist collective farmers should do. Third, practice thrift and build the country with thrift, practice thrift in the family, is Chairman Mao's call. Saving a bit in life is in line with Chairman Mao's instructions. If the collective production develops and is all divided and eaten, what is the superiority of socialism?

Chairman Mao said: "Scientific things are not afraid of criticism at any time because science is truth and is not afraid of refutation." If it can be refuted by others, then it proves that there is no truth in their hands. In just two months, in the face of ironclad facts, this work team was beaten black and blue and was driven away in disgrace. Chairman Mao cares about Dazhai, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line illuminates Dazhai. Later, with the direct participation of the Central Committee, the Dazhai Party Branch, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, carried out the Four Clean-ups with the broad masses. The result of the Four Clean-ups proved that Dazhai was acting in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in politics, ideology, organization, and economy.

Of course, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi would not learn from their failures. The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Dazhai resolutely resisted the capitalist evil winds and tenaciously opposed their plots and sabotage, making them even more resentful. In 1965 and 1966, they secretly investigated "materials" again, attempting to frame the cadres of Dazhai. Thanks to the great proletarian cultural revolution that began, their evil plots were completely foiled.

Chairman Mao taught us: "For us, a person, a party, an army, or a school, if not opposed by the enemy, that would not be good, that would mean we have merged with the enemy. If opposed by the enemy, that would be good, that would mean we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us as worthless and having no merits, that would be even better, that would mean we not only have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also prove that our work has achieved great results." China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi have, over the years, blown one black wind after another against and sabotaging Dazhai, but they have not harmed a single hair of Dazhai; on the contrary, this proves that the work of Dazhai has achieved results and has not disappointed the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations; it also makes us more determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher and strive for greater victories on the socialist path!

Beat the Fallen Dogs and Settle Accounts with China's Khrushchev

Dazhai Brigade was able to smash the plots and sabotage of the class enemies, advancing against one current after another, fundamentally because of the correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has armed the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, enabling them to adhere to the socialist direction in the face of storms and waves; in the three great revolutionary movements, they were able to overcome the severe onslaughts of natural disasters and the sabotage of class enemies.

This great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has, in more than a year of struggle, made us further understand: in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, is long-term and extremely sharp and complex. Chairman Mao told us that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main target of the revolution is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, the small clique of those who take the capitalist road within the Party. The contradiction between this small clique of bad guys and the broad revolutionary masses is the main contradiction and an antagonistic contradiction. Trees have roots, and water has sources. China's Khrushchev, this big bad guy, is the head of the small clique of those who take the capitalist road in various regions and departments, and is also the backer of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside; it can be said that for many years, every black wind that has blown in the countryside has not been one that China's Khrushchev did not personally direct and support. For many years, whatever Chairman Mao advocates, he opposes; Chairman Mao leads us to walk the bright road of socialism, but he wants to drag us into the dead-end of capitalism; Chairman Mao personally raised the Dazhai red flag, but he wants to destroy Dazhai and cut down the red flag, raising a black flag.

The small clique of those who take the capitalist road within the Party, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, their methods are cunning and hidden, but also extremely vicious. They use the power they have usurped in the Party, government, finance, and culture to use both soft and hard methods against those who adhere to the socialist direction and resist their reactionary actions; either they use economic inducements and ideological corruption, or they implement white terror. The purpose of their sabotage activities is not just to frame a certain person or destroy a certain brigade but to change the color of the entire China. This small clique of bad guys is so hostile to Dazhai, doing everything possible to destroy Dazhai, because they want to destroy the socialist economic foundation in a larger area. We say that China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places are the worms on the flagpole of the great red flag of socialism. Only by uprooting this small clique of worms can the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction develop faster and better.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have personally experienced that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and the socialist collective economy is our stronghold. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought and whoever sabotages the people's commune, we will fight to the end. China's Khrushchev, this bad guy, is a wolf in human skin, and he has done countless evil deeds. Now is the time for us to settle accounts with him. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai are determined to unite closely with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dogs," with even greater effort than when we fought the Tiger Mountain, to thoroughly fight down, fight over, and fight to the end China's Khrushchev and his small clique of agents in Shanxi! Thoroughly eliminate the poison they have spread in the agricultural front!

    大寨是在同中国赫鲁晓夫的斗争中前进的
    陈永贵
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，是无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人，也是我国五亿农民的死对头。多少年来，他利用篡夺的职权，披着“老革命”的外衣，在农村中贩卖了大量的资本主义货色，到处拆社会主义集体经济的台。我们大寨的广大贫下中农和干部，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，坚持社会主义方向，同中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，进行了长期的针锋相对的斗争。当前，文化大革命正深入发展，全国掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。我们大寨的广大贫下中农，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，开展了大揭发、大批判、大斗争的群众运动，向中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。革命的大批判，好得很！它是将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们的国家按照毛主席指引的道路胜利前进的重要步骤。
    合作化运动中的一场严重斗争
    毛主席早在抗日战争时期就教导我们说：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化”。毛主席还说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”“除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”我们大寨的贫下中农对毛主席的书读得还不多，但是我们学一句就用一句。毛主席的这几句话，多少年来就印在我们脑子里了。我们下定决心，不管风多大，浪多高，社会主义道路是走定了。从成立互助组、合作社，到建立人民公社，我们大寨都跑在前头。
    也正象毛主席早就预见到的：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”“至死不变、愿意带着花冈岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的”。农业合作化运动一开始，不仅是地、富、反、坏分子起劲地唱反调，混进党和政府里的资产阶级代理人也跳出来反对和破坏。他们相互配合，煽阴风，点鬼火，设关卡，泼冷水，明里暗里干下了许多坏事。所有这些坏人坏事，我们现在查明，它的总后台、也是农业合作化运动的最大的破坏者，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在一九五一年，当我们山西的广大贫下中农，根据毛主席的教导，提出把互助组提高一步试办农业合作社的要求时，这个坏家伙给我们当头一棒。他在一个报告中胡批着：“……有人提出了这样的意见：应该逐步地动摇、削弱直至否定私有基础，把农业生产互助组提高到农业生产合作社，以此作为新的因素，去‘战胜农民的自发势力’。这是一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想。”看，这顶帽子可不小！一脑袋资产阶级思想的中国的赫鲁晓夫，满嘴胡说八道，其目的就是反对社会主义。我们无数的革命先烈流血牺牲，就是为了消灭私有制，搞社会主义。难道我们不去削弱私有基础，还要加强私有基础吗？互助组不提高到合作社，难道还要退回到一家一户去单干吗？难道我们贫下中农受单干的苦还不够吗？
    这里，我不能不提到当时发生在我们大寨的事情。一九五二年春天，我们一心一意要求把互助组提高一步，办成初级合作社。那时，县的领导机关听到了从省里传下去的中国的赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，虽然我向县里跑了十几趟，一再反映广大贫下中农急于办社的心情和要求，县里的负责人就是不敢批准。等到一九五三年才批准了我们办合作社。我们的互助组是四十九户的大组，但是，县里只批准我们办三十户的社。剩下的十九户怎么办呢？谁也不愿意走单干的老路。我们只好搞两本账：一本账是对付上级的，明报三十户；另一本账是自己用的，暗中办四十九户的社。到秋收分配时，还是被县里的干部发现了，把我们批评了一顿。中国的赫鲁晓夫和农村的地主、富农穿一条裤腿。他们象蝙蝠怕见太阳一样，那么害怕农业合作化！当然，“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的”。不仅是我们大寨，甚至我们山西，以及全国的广大贫下中农，都没有听中国的赫鲁晓夫那一套，而是按毛主席的指示办事，把互助组提高到合作社，以后又实现了人民公社化。中国的赫鲁晓夫最怕削弱私有基础，我们就硬是要削弱私有基础。不仅是削弱，而且还要不断地创造条件，把这个万恶的私有基础连根拔掉。
    就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在这同一个时间里，还扯起“巩固新民主主义秩序”的破旗，鼓吹“四大自由”、“剥削有功”、“剥削光荣”，提倡发展“三马一犁一车”式的农户，还规定出指标，要在数年后，发展到占农户的百分之八十。这是他明目张胆地站在富农的立场上说话，为发展富农经济鸣锣开道。我是扛长工出身的。在旧社会，我自己要啥没啥，但是“东家”的马、犁、车我见过不少，也用过不少。叫我说，一户人家发展到有三头马、一架犁、一辆车，不够个地主，也是个富农。中国的赫鲁晓夫不是在为已经被打倒的地主、富农起尸还魂，又是干什么？
    也就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在一九五五年农业合作化高潮到来时，大砍农业合作社；在一九六二年国家遇到暂时经济困难时，他攻击三面红旗，推行“三自一包”，大刮单干风。有风就有浪。中国的赫鲁晓夫每一次刮起的黑风，都吹到了山西，也吹到了大寨。由于伟大的舵手毛主席，在每一个关键时刻，都及时地发出了指示，使我们很快地识破了敌人的阴谋，顶住了歪风，保证了社会主义集体经济的胜利发展，使中国的赫鲁晓夫妄想在农村发展、复辟资本主义，使我们贫下中农重新当奴隶的狼子野心没法实现。
    妄图拔掉大寨红旗的阴谋彻底破产
    毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。”事实证明这是千真万确的道理。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，在农业合作化高潮前，一贯地反对农业社会主义改造，推行长期“保存富农经济的政策”。在农业社会主义改造基本完成后，又千方百计地拆社会主义集体经济的台。说什么人民公社办早了，高级社不如初级社，包产到户有优越性，不要怕资本主义泛滥，等等。但是，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，“社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”全国在前进，山西在前进，大寨在前进！人民公社化后的一九六○年，大寨大队遭遇了历史上少见的大旱。俗话说：“春旱捉苗难，夏怕卡脖旱，秋旱结籽难。”正是在这三个火候上，山西地区严重缺雨。但这一年，是大寨大队历史上产粮最多的一年，向国家缴售粮食最多的一年，也是社员分得口粮最多的一年。这样的事实有力地证明了：人民公社具有无比优越性，证明了毛主席提出的自力更生方针的完全正确，证明了毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成改天换地的巨大物质力量。大寨大队在社会主义道路上不断取得的新成就，引起了全国人民的注意。特别是伟大领袖毛主席发出“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，全国许多兄弟省、县、社的同志到大寨参观，世界各国朋友一批一批地到大寨访问，这都给了大寨的贫下中农以很大的鼓舞。
    在毛泽东思想指引下，大寨大队取得的一个又一个胜利，都戳痛了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，冲击了他们在农业阵地上推行的一套修正主义路线。他们越来越感觉到：大寨这面红旗是他们在农村进行资本主义复辟活动的障碍。因此，他们把大寨看作是眼中钉、肉中刺。大寨大队越是向前发展，越是创造出新的成绩和新的经验，他们越是害怕，越是起劲地反对和破坏。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在山西的代理人反对大寨的罪恶活动，从一九六一年起更加紧了脚步。在这一年，一个刚刚派到昔阳县委的第一书记，到职的第七天，就匆匆忙忙地带领十几个人到大寨去检查所谓“虚夸”问题。他的愿望达不到时，就胡说我们少报了土地，强迫我们压低产量，一定要我们把一九六○年实际亩产六百二十斤，报成五百八十斤；把全年向国家缴售粮食二十四万斤，报成二十二万斤。他们就是这样蛮不讲理地对大寨的贫下中农大泼冷水，往大寨红旗上抹黑，否定社会主义集体经济的优越性。
    一九六四年冬，他们又借四清运动的机会，妄图拔掉大寨这面红旗，有组织有计划地演了一出丑剧。这次来势更猛，折腾的时间更长，花样也更多；同时，他们的嘴脸在大寨群众面前也暴露得更清楚，更彻底。
    四清是具有伟大意义的社会主义教育运动。毛主席对四清运动规定了一系列正确的路线、方针和政策。派到大寨的由原省委、地委和县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派操纵的工作队，根本不执行毛主席的革命路线，而是忠实地执行中国的赫鲁晓夫形“左”实右的反动路线。他们进驻大寨的两个月中，没有组织群众和干部学习一次毛主席著作，而对于中国的赫鲁晓夫卖劲吹捧的一个所谓农村四清“先进经验”，却组织群众和干部学过二十多遍。他们不接近贫下中农和基层干部，专找对基层干部意见最多的人。什么人对大寨大队干部的意见最多呢？当然首先是受管制的地、富、反、坏分子。这些家伙积极地为他们提供“材料”，成为他们四清的依靠力量。广大贫下中农和基层干部，却成了他们斗争和打击的主要目标。他们就是这样大长地、富、反、坏的威风，大灭贫下中农的革命志气。
    毛主席说：“凡属倒退行为，结果都和主持者的原来的愿望相反。古今中外，没有例外。”他们这样做，就从反面教育了我们。许多人开始考虑这样的问题：这个工作队是什么人派来的呢？他们又是来干什么的呢？越来越多的事实证明，派这个工作队来的人和主持这个工作队的人是别有用心的。他们不是来帮助大寨、促进大寨，而是要来整垮大寨、搞臭大寨。我们同这个反大寨的工作队进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    在工作队经过一番“扎根串连”和“秘密工作”之后，就把大寨定为有严重问题的三类队。他们到处宣传：大寨这面红旗是靠弄虚作假树起来的，“大寨的红旗杆上生了虫虫，不把虫挖掉，红旗不能高举”。他们按照中国的赫鲁晓夫的意图，夺了大寨大队的党政大权，干部统统靠边站，由他们指挥一切，掌握一切。在他们妄想搞臭整垮大寨的“根据”中有这样几条：
    他们说：大寨是山地、旱地，粮食亩产量这么高，一定是少报了土地。为了查出“黑地”，他们创造了全国丈量土地的奇迹，组织了一个有省、地、县、社和邻近大队干部参加的五级查地队伍。有七十多人参加，花了五十多天工夫，仔仔细细地查了两遍。结果不但没有多出土地，还比大寨自报的数目少了几亩。
    他们说：土地没有少报，那么必然是产的粮食数目不实。于是他们又查账目、对户头，还把留下的粮食过了秤，结果粮食数目也是一斤不少。
    他们又说：几十户人家，几百亩土地，每年能向国家缴售二十四万斤粮食，这当中一定有假。他们找到县粮食局，查看了大寨历年来缴售粮食的账目，结果还是找不到弄虚作假的证据。
    一计不成，又生一计，他们说：大寨大队的粮食没有扣除水分，违犯了国家政策。大寨的产量所以高，主要是因为没有扣除水分造成的假象。为了找个强加罪名的根据，他们又进行“扎根串连”的秘密工作。他们找到一户贫农社员家，这户社员有五口人，每人实际分到口粮五百六十斤。工作队的人以要扣除水分为名，七折八扣地计算，对这户社员说，你每口人分到的不是五百六十斤，而是二百三十斤。他们用这种办法挑拨社员群众同基层干部、同集体、同国家之间的关系，诬蔑大寨大队的干部罪恶滔天。我们没有向这种颠倒是非、混淆黑白的行为妥协。我们说：不扣除水分，不仅不是大寨的错误，相反，正是个优点。因为粮食晒干了，不扣除水分是合理的。正因为我们不扣除水分，按实际总产量计算，就多卖了粮食给国家。剩下的粮食，是属于社员所有，社员需要多分就多分，需要少分就少分，又何必扣除水分呢？最后他们终于无话可讲了。为这件事，我们还反问过他们：苏联的赫鲁晓夫造谣说中国的大跃进失败了，人民公社搞糟了；诬蔑中国人民困难得不得了，五个人穿一条裤子，喝清水汤。你们硬是要我们把实产的粮食扣除水分来计算，把每人实分得的五百六十斤，硬说成只有二百三十斤，这不是正适应了赫鲁晓夫的需要吗？把实产的粮食再扣除水分，多留给自己，少卖给国家，这对社会主义建设又有什么好处？
    他们仍然不甘心失败，又把大寨大队取消劳动定额、实行标兵工分的管理制度作为一条罪状。他们说：这是不分勤懒“神仙一把抓”，“不符合按劳分配的原则”，“是陈永贵训话搞起来的，不是社员自愿的”。我们用事实驳斥了他们。大寨大队实行这种标兵工分、自报公议的制度后，出勤率增多了，劳动效率也提高了。社员能做重活的做重活，不能做重活的做轻活，没有推脱的，也很少有不负责任的。一九六二年，也就是实行这种管理制度的前一年，男女全半劳力全年每人平均实做劳动日二百五十个，一九六三年平均二百六十个，一九六四年平均二百八十个。我们说：这种管理制度就是好，是用毛泽东思想挂帅的，不是用工分挂帅的。它体现了按劳分配的原则，比那些繁琐的定额管理办法更合理，也更简便。这是社员群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、从实践中创造出来的，不是那一个干部强加在群众头上的。
    当他们不得不承认大寨大队的产量是实在的，卖给国家的余粮就是多，经营管理是合理的，就又在安排社员生活上给我们提出一条“错误”。说大寨生产的粮食多，社员吃的却不好。我们回答他们的是：第一，我们吃的是不太好。但是，同过去比较，不知要好多少倍。第二，大寨的贫下中农艰苦奋斗、自力更生地发展生产，不是为了自己，而是为了支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命。假设我们生产是为了自己吃得好，不卖超额粮给国家，一年打下的粮食可以吃三年。但是，这不是社会主义集体农民应该做的。第三，厉行节约，勤俭建国，勤俭持家，是毛主席的号召。在生活上节省点，是符合毛主席指示的。如果集体生产发展了，都分掉吃掉，还有什么社会主义的优越性？
    毛主席说：“科学的东西，随便什么时候都是不怕人家批评的，因为科学是真理，决不怕人家驳。”如果能被别人驳倒，那就证明他手中没有真理。仅仅两个月的时间，在铁的事实面前，这个工作队碰得头破血流，灰溜溜地被赶走了。毛主席关怀着大寨，毛主席的革命路线照耀着大寨。后来在中央直接派人参加下，大寨党支部依照毛主席的指示，和广大群众一道进行了四清。四清的结果，证明大寨在政治、思想、组织、经济各方面都是按照毛主席和党中央的指示办事的。
    当然，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在山西的代理人是不会从失败中吸取教训的。大寨的贫下中农和干部坚决抵制资本主义歪风、顽强地反对他们的阴谋破坏，使他们更加怀恨在心。一九六五年和一九六六年，他们又偷偷摸摸地调查“材料”，企图再一次陷害大寨的干部。由于伟大的无产阶级文化大革命开始了，才使他们的罪恶阴谋彻底破产。
    毛主席教导我们说：“对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，几年来一次又一次地刮起反对、破坏大寨的黑风，并没有损害大寨的一根毫毛，更不能丝毫动摇大寨贫下中农走社会主义道路的决心；恰恰相反，这正证明大寨的工作是作出了成绩，没有辜负伟大领袖毛主席的期望；也更加促使我们大长革命志气，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在社会主义道路上争取更大的胜利！
    痛打落水狗，同中国的赫鲁晓夫算总账
    大寨大队所以能够粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋破坏，迎着一股又一股逆流大踏步前进，最根本的是由于有伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导。是毛泽东思想武装了大寨贫下中农的头脑，在大风大浪中始终坚持社会主义方向；在三大革命运动中，既能够战胜严重自然灾害的袭击，也能够战胜阶级敌人的破坏。
    这一次毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，一年多来的斗争事实，使我们又进一步懂得：在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，资产阶级和无产阶级两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是长期的、也是十分尖锐复杂的。毛主席告诉我们，在无产阶级专政条件下，革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这一小撮坏家伙同广大革命群众的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。树有根，水有源，中国的赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋就是埋藏在各地区、各部门里的走资本主义道路的当权派的总头目，也是农村中地、富、反、坏分子的总后台；可以说，多少年来在农村中刮起的一股又一股反社会主义黑风，没有那一股不是由中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自指挥和支持的。多少年以来，毛主席提倡什么，他就反对什么。毛主席领导我们走社会主义的光明大道，他就妄想把我们拉向资本主义的死胡同；毛主席亲手树立起大寨这面红旗，他就要整垮大寨，砍掉红旗，树立黑旗。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打着“红旗”反红旗，他们的手法既狡猾、隐蔽，又十分毒辣。他们利用篡夺的一部分党、政、财、文大权，对坚持社会主义方向、抵制他们的反动言行的人，使用软硬两手；要不就是用经济利诱和从思想上腐蚀，要不就是实行白色恐怖。他们进行破坏活动的目的，不只是陷害某一个人，搞垮某一个大队，而是要改变整个中国的颜色。这一小撮坏家伙，所以那么仇视大寨，千方百计地要搞垮大寨，他们是为了在更大的范围内搞垮农村社会主义的经济基础。我们说，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人，才是社会主义伟大红旗旗杆上的虫虫，挖掉这一小撮虫虫，社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业才能更快更好地向前发展。
    我们大寨的贫下中农亲身体会到：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，社会主义集体经济是我们的靠山。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁破坏人民公社，我们就要和他拚到底。中国的赫鲁晓夫这个坏家伙，是披着人皮的狼，他干尽了坏事。现在是我们向他算总账的时候了。我们大寨的贫下中农，决心和全国的无产阶级革命派紧紧地团结在一起，发扬“痛打落水狗”的革命精神，拿出比我们大战虎头山更大的劲头，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的一小撮代理人，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！彻底肃清他们在农业阵地上散布的流毒！
