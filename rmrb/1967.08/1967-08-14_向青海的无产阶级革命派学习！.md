In the midst of the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been established.

This is another resounding victory song of Mao Zedong Thought that shakes the earth. It is a new great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The people of Qinghai rejoice for this victory, and the people of the entire nation are inspired by this victory.

Over the past eighteen years since liberation, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, following the instructions of their master—the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party—have been vigorously pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in Qinghai, building their own independent kingdom, and defying the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They have been madly attempting to restore capitalism.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have become even more desperate, stubbornly pushing the reactionary bourgeois line. They have used various despicable means to distort right and wrong, confuse right and wrong, suppress and oppress revolutionary masses, and collude with counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship to impose white terror in Qinghai. They have attacked and suppressed the proletarian revolutionaries, labeling many revolutionary pioneers as "counter-revolutionaries," "rightists," and "monsters and demons." However, the proletarian revolutionaries in Qinghai, with the "August 18" leftist organization as the core, have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the complex and fierce class struggle. They have overcome one difficulty after another and finally achieved a great victory in the struggle for power.

The great People's Liberation Army of China has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call for "three supports and two militaries," breathing and sharing fate with the Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries, fighting shoulder to shoulder. In the struggle, they have stood firmly, supported the proletarian revolutionaries wholeheartedly, and provided the greatest support to the proletarian revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought. The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries are most grateful to the PLA for bringing them Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention to this and never be careless." The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries have firmly implemented this highest directive during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are indeed models in executing the Party's policies. During the period when the reactionary bourgeois line was dominant, they suffered deeply. However, after the proletarian revolutionaries rose up, they persisted in persuading and educating the deceived masses, did not engage in retaliation, insisted on political struggle, and did not resort to armed struggle. The model actions of the proletarian revolutionaries have moved those who were deeply deceived in the past, and they have said, "How good are the revolutionaries nurtured by Chairman Mao!"

The more the Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries firmly implement the Party's policies, the more they feel the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. Because they have seen with their own eyes that where the policies are well implemented, the masses are well mobilized; where the deceived masses turn around quickly, production is well managed. Conversely, if the Party's policies are not followed, and those who have opposed them are retaliated against, then the antagonism among the masses will be greater, the work with those who have participated in conservative organizations will be more difficult, and the prestige of the revolutionary faction will not only not be enhanced but will decline. This is not conducive to uniting the majority of the masses and fiercely attacking a handful of the most dangerous enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must unite with all those who can be united. He also emphasizes that we must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries have the great breadth of proletarian revolutionaries. Standing on the Qinghai Plateau, they look out over the vast land of the motherland and think of the world revolution. They learn from the PLA to strengthen political and ideological work, bringing problems to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They attach great importance to the work of winning over and educating the masses deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line. They do not exclude, discriminate against, or make everyone pass a test for those who have participated in conservative organizations, nor do they engage in "limitless elevation." Instead, with deep class feelings, they conduct painstaking political and ideological work with their class brothers who have been poisoned by the reactionary bourgeois line, joining them in exposing, denouncing, criticizing, and fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line they push. Comrades who have suffered the deepest persecution from the proletarian revolutionary faction actively seek out those who have participated in conservative organizations to have heart-to-heart talks, starting from the desire for unity, helping them learn the Party's guidelines and policies, awakening their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and winning them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary faction is not afraid of setbacks, not afraid of hard work, and has done a great deal of painstaking work, gradually awakening those who have participated in conservative organizations, including those leaders who have made serious mistakes but are willing to correct them, to turn around and strike back, actively aligning themselves with the proletarian revolutionaries.

The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries stand tall and see far because they listen to Chairman Mao the most and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. They do not hold personal grudges but hold class grudges. They believe that all accounts should be settled with the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. All sins should be placed on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and the deceived masses are not to blame.

The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries have the courage and perseverance to do painstaking political and ideological work because their proletarian consciousness is high, they are ruthless towards the enemy, lenient towards themselves, and have boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao. They follow every directive from the proletarian headquarters with meticulous care and implement them resolutely. They say well: "Winning over one more deceived mass is adding one more strength for the revolution, doing one more good deed for the people, and is a concrete manifestation of listening to Chairman Mao and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries are indeed good students of Chairman Mao. In the complex class struggle, they are good at correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions. They have not only achieved results in winning over and educating the deceived masses but have also made progress in handling contradictions and differences within the revolutionary faction. After the proletarian revolutionary faction has gained political and organizational advantages, some leaders of revolutionary organizations have also appeared with wrong practices such as pulling up from above and eating from below, expanding their own mountain strongholds, and suppressing other revolutionary organizations. At the critical moment when "internal war" was about to break out, it was the People's Liberation Army that stepped forward to help the revolutionary youngsters, guiding the revolutionary youngsters. The responsible comrades of the Military Region invited them to sit together, study Chairman Mao's works, and conduct rectification. Through study, they examined their thoughts, fought hard against the "self," and the sparks of "internal war" were extinguished, further solidifying and developing the great unity of the revolution. Some comrades have deeply felt: "Taking back the power of 'self' in the mind is truly more difficult than enduring the test of persecution by the reactionary bourgeois line!" To make a revolution, one must unite the majority and correctly treat the masses; to make a revolution, one must break with selfishness and correctly treat oneself. This is the profound understanding that the Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries have gained from their own struggle practice.

The Qinghai proletarian revolutionaries have created new experiences for the power struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries across the country and have set a good example in carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and firmly implementing the Party's policies. The People's Liberation Army in the Qinghai region has set a bright banner in the work of supporting the left. Let us learn from them well and promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our own regions, departments, and units to new and greater victories.

    向青海的无产阶级革命派学习！
    任立新
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗的革命烈火中，青海省革命委员会成立了。
    这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想又一曲震动大地的凯歌。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的新的伟大胜利。
    青海人民为这个胜利而欢呼，全国人民为这个胜利而鼓舞。
    解放十八年来，青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，根据他们的主子——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，在青海竭力推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞独立王国，与毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部分庭抗礼，疯狂地复辟资本主义。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们更是狗急跳墙，顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线。他们采取各种卑劣的手段，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，打击和压制革命群众，伙同混进无产阶级专政机构内部的反革命分子，在青海实行白色恐怖。他们围攻无产阶级革命派，镇压无产阶级革命派，把许许多多革命闯将打成“反革命”、“右派”、“牛鬼蛇神”。但是，青海省以“八·一八”左派组织为核心的无产阶级革命派，在复杂的激烈的阶级斗争中，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜了一个又一个艰难险阻，终于取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，坚决响应毛主席“三支”“两军”的伟大号召，和青海无产阶级革命派同呼吸，共命运，肩并肩地共同战斗。他们在斗争中，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，坚决支持无产阶级革命派。千支持，万支持，毛泽东思想是他们给无产阶级革命派最大的支持。千感谢，万感谢，青海无产阶级革命派首先感谢的是解放军给他们带来了毛泽东思想、党的政策。
    毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”青海省无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决执行了这个最高指示。他们不愧为执行党的政策的模范。在资产阶级反动路线占统治地位时期，他们受迫害很深。可是，在无产阶级革命派翻身后，对受蒙蔽的群众坚持说服教育，不搞打击报复，坚持文斗，不用武斗。无产阶级革命派的模范行动，使那些过去受蒙蔽很深的群众也为之感动，他们感慨地说：“毛主席培养出来的革命派多好啊！”
    越是坚决执行党的政策，青海无产阶级革命派越是体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力。因为他们亲眼看到，那个地方执行政策好，那个地方群众就发动得好；那个地方受蒙蔽的群众就转过来得快，那个地方生产也就搞得好。反之，不按党的政策办事，对曾经反对过自己的人进行打击报复，那么，群众之间对立情绪就更大，对参加过保守组织的群众的工作就更难做，革命派的威信不但不会提高，反而会下降。这样，就不利于团结最大多数的群众，狠狠打击一小撮最主要、最危险的敌人。
    毛主席教导我们：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。他还强调，必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。青海省无产阶级革命派有无产阶级革命者的伟大胸怀，他们站在青海高原，遥望着祖国大地，想着世界革命。他们学习解放军加强政治思想工作，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作的经验。他们非常重视争取和教育受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众的工作。他们对参加过保守组织的群众，不排斥，不歧视，不搞人人过关，不搞“无限上纲”，而是满怀着深厚的阶级感情，对受过资产阶级反动路线毒害的阶级兄弟，进行艰苦细致的政治思想工作，同他们一道对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及他们推行的资产阶级反动路线开展大揭发、大控诉、大批判、大斗争。过去受迫害最深的无产阶级革命派同志，积极主动地去找参加过保守组织的群众谈心，从团结的愿望出发，帮助他们学习党的方针政策，启发他们对两条路线斗争的觉悟，争取他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。革命派不怕碰钉子，不怕下功夫，进行了大量的艰苦细致的工作，使参加过保守组织的群众，包括那些犯了严重错误但还愿意改正的头头逐渐觉醒过来，扭转方向，反戈一击，积极地向无产阶级革命派靠拢。
    青海省无产阶级革命派之所以站得高，看得远，就是因为他们最听毛主席的话，紧紧掌握斗争大方向。他们不记私人仇，个人恨，而记阶级仇，阶级恨。他们认为千笔账，万笔账，应该记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的头上。千条罪，万条罪，受蒙蔽的群众没有罪，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是罪魁祸首。
    青海省无产阶级革命派之所以有勇气、有毅力做艰苦细致的政治思想工作，就是因为他们的无产阶级觉悟高，对敌狠，对己和，对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对无产阶级司令部的每一个指示都一丝不苟，坚决照办。他们说得好：“多争取一个受蒙蔽的群众，就是为革命多增添了一份力量，就是为人民多做了一件好事，就是听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的具体表现”。
    青海省无产阶级革命派不愧是毛主席的好学生。他们在复杂的阶级斗争当中，善于正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。他们不仅在争取和教育受蒙蔽的群众的问题上做出了成绩，同时，在处理革命派内部矛盾与分歧问题上也取得了成效。无产阶级革命派在政治上和组织上取得优势以后，有的革命组织的负责人也出现过上边拉大的，下边吃小的，壮大自己的山头，压制别的革命组织等错误作法。在快要出现“内战”的关键时刻，又是人民解放军站出来帮助革命小将，引导革命小将。军区负责同志请他们坐到一起，学习毛主席著作，进行整风。通过学习，检查了思想，狠斗了“私”字，“内战”的火苗就被扑灭下去了，革命的大联合得到了进一步的巩固和发展。有的同志很有感触地说：“夺头脑里‘私’字的权真比经受资产阶级反动路线迫害的考验还要难啊！”搞革命，就要团结大多数，正确对待群众；搞革命，就要破私立公，正确对待自己。这就是青海无产阶级革命派从自己的斗争实践中得到的深刻体会。
    青海省无产阶级革命派，为全国无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争创造了新经验，在发扬革命造反精神，坚决执行党的政策等方面作出了好榜样。青海地区的人民解放军，在支左工作中树立了鲜红的旗帜。让我们很好地向他们学习，推动我们本地区、本部门、本单位的无产阶级文化大革命向新的更伟大的胜利前进。
