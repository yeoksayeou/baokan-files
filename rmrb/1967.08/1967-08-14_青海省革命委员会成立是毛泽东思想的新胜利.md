The establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The triumphant song of the Qinghai Plateau greatly boosts the revolutionary spirit of the people and soldiers across the nation.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 13th, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation have enthusiastically hailed the birth of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They pointed out: On the joyous occasion of celebrating the first anniversary of the convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, amidst the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and in the new high tide of revolutionary criticism launched by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, the birth of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another great joy for the revolutionary people of all nationalities across the nation. It is another great victory in the struggle for power seizure by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. It is a new great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in our strategic rear. It is another triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and other places, as well as the soldiers and officers of the stationed troops who firmly support the broad leftist masses, were overjoyed upon hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They unanimously expressed their determination to follow the example of the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Qinghai, who take "August 18" as their core, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will follow the example of the People's Liberation Army in the Qinghai region, firmly and unconditionally execute all the directives of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, clearly support and protect the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, further strengthen the unity between the military and the people, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to victory.

Commander Zhang Siyuan and Political Commissar Liu Feng of the Wuhan Military Region said with great emotion: The proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the stationed troops in Qinghai have made tremendous contributions to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Qinghai and have established immortal merits, setting a brilliant example for us. We, the entire ranks of soldiers and officers of the Wuhan Military Region, extend our warmest congratulations to them and sincerely learn from them. We will most resolutely execute the great directive of the great commander-in-chief Mao Zedong that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses, most resolutely respond to the great call of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat," most steadfastly follow the commands of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, most resolutely execute the directives of the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and tightly unite with the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat such as "Steel Workers Federation," "Steel Second Command," "Steel 913," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands Alliance" in Wuhan, fight together, and win together.

The revolutionary fighters of "Changsha Workers Federation" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" said with great emotion: The birth of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great encouragement and promotion for us, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Hunan. We must seriously learn from the experience of the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Qinghai, more diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, achieve the revolutionary great alliance in the revolutionary great criticism, and carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat better, creating a new Hunan that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat of "August 27 Commune" in Henan and "August 24" in Kaifeng, who had received strong support from the proletarian revolutionary cadres of "August 18" in Qinghai during the period of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, were extremely moved and excited when they heard the joyous news of the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee on the radio. Many people, with tears of joy, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!" The responsible person of the preparatory committee of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the first political commissar of the Henan Military Region, Liu Jianxun, and the second political commissar, Wang Xin, immediately sent a telegram to Liu Xianquan and the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee after listening to the radio broadcast today. The telegram said: "August 18" in Qinghai and "August 27 Commune" in Henan are both revolutionary rebels who have emerged from the persecution of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and in the common struggle, they have forged a class friendship of life and death. Let us forever follow the course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, unite, fight, and win together. The fighters of the "August 24" Revolutionary Rebel Corps in Kaifeng said: Although "August 18" in Qinghai and "August 24" in Kaifeng are separated by thousands of miles, the red hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line bind us closely together.

We must learn from their daring spirit of struggle and complete the great historical task of the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Inner Mongolia. At the meeting held by the stationed troops in Hohhot to respond to the great call of Vice Chairman Lin to achieve new merits in the revolution, Political Commissar Wu Tao of the Inner Mongolia Military Region called on the broad ranks of soldiers and officers to learn from the comrades of the Qinghai Military Region and the stationed troops, firmly support the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.
