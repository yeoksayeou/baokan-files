Philippine Workers at U.S. Air Base Strike

About 7,000 Filipino workers at the U.S. Clark Air Base in the Philippines went on strike on the 20th, causing serious disruptions to the base's operations and hindering U.S. air force bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

According to Manila newspapers, the strike was in response to the unreasonable dismissal of over 300 Filipino workers by the base authorities, who refused to allow these workers to return to work.

At the time of the strike announcement, 90% of the 30,000 Filipino workers at this U.S. base participated in demonstrations, protesting against American imperialism's discrimination against Filipino workers.

Meanwhile, about 1,500 jeepney drivers joined the strike on the 21st.
