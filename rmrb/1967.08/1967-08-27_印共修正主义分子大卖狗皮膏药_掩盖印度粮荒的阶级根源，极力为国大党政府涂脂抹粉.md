Indian revisionist communists are peddling snake oil, covering up the class roots of India's famine, and eagerly whitewashing the Congress Party government.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, our correspondent comments: India's famine has reached an unprecedentedly severe state. Hundreds of millions of Indian people are suffering from hunger and death. This situation is entirely the result of the Congress Party, which represents the interests of the landlords and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, implementing extremely reactionary domestic and foreign policies. However, the Indian revisionist communists, who have long been dreaming of "peaceful transition," are eagerly whitewashing the Indian reactionary government, covering up the class roots and political causes of the famine, and openly serving the reactionary ruling class.

The Indian revisionist communists' despicable actions were fully exposed in an opinion paper on India's food problem issued in April this year. In this opinion paper, they did not dare to touch upon the evil rule of the Indian reactionaries, nor did they dare to call on the Indian people to rebel against the Indian reactionary government. Instead, they talked about how the Congress Party government should "carry out fundamental land reform," "stop importing American grain," "purchase all surplus grain," "control the prices of all commodities," and so on. All these arguments that are like talking to a tiger about its skin are actually helping the Indian reactionaries deceive the Indian people.

"Carry out fundamental land reform?" In Indian villages, this is indeed an urgent matter. However, the Congress Party government, which represents the interests of the landlords and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, how can it carry out fundamental land reform in India? Since India's independence in 1947, the Congress Party government has pretended to pass many "land reform" bills, but the result is that agricultural land is even more concentrated, feudal exploitation is even more severe, and the ranks of poor tenant farmers have expanded. According to Indian official statistics, currently, 20% of Indian rural households own 75% of all cultivated land, while 80% of rural households own only 25% of the cultivated land, of which the bottom 50% of households own only 2.7% of the land.

True land reform in India did occur, but it was not under the reactionary rule of the Congress Party, which represents the landlords, bureaucrats, and comprador bourgeoisie. Instead, it happened twenty years ago in the armed struggle areas of Telangana. When the rebel farmers there took up arms and established a red regime, they carried out true land reform in the liberated areas, confiscating six million acres of land from landlords and distributing it without compensation to landless and poor farmers, allowing Telangana farmers to overturn their fate for the first time. However, it was precisely because of the betrayal by the leaders of the Indian revisionist communists that the victory fruits seized by the revolutionary farmers in the armed struggle were all lost.

"Stop importing American grain?" Today, India's grain production has been decreasing year by year, and the import of American grain has been increasing year by year. Since India signed the first grain agreement with the United States under the so-called "Public Law 480" in 1956, by the end of 1965, India had imported a total of 37.28 million tons of grain from the United States, valued at 11.12 billion rupees. It is revealed that the total amount of rupees held by the U.S. Embassy in India is estimated to account for one-quarter to one-half of India's total currency circulation. The dumping of American grain (much of which is rotten) has fattened American monopolies and Indian bureaucratic comprador capitalists and landlords, and has also made the Indian reactionary government increasingly dependent on U.S. imperialism politically. As a result, India's rural economy has been further devastated, and a large number of agricultural workers have flowed into cities, making the Indian government unable to escape the predicament of relying on American grain. An official of the Congress Party who once served as the Minister of Food openly admitted: "The Indian government 'has no other way but to import as much grain as possible...' 'Not relying on foreign grain supply would be suicide.'"

Talking about having the Congress Party government "purchase all surplus grain" and "control the prices of all commodities" is even more self-deceptive. Currently, in India, not only is the grain black market rampant and grain prices soaring, with landlords and bureaucratic capitalists making huge profits, but even the grain nominally controlled by the government is, due to the collusion between capitalists and bureaucratic politicians, mostly diverted to the black market and sold at high prices. Therefore, even this meager rationed grain controlled by the government is often unavailable to the starving Indian people, so how can one expect the Congress Party reactionary government to "purchase" the grain of landlords and profiteers and "control" the prices of market commodities?!

The reality of India's long-term severe famine and widespread starvation over the past twenty years since independence has educated the Indian people: to fundamentally solve India's famine, it is not those deceptive "reforms" advocated by the Indian revisionist communists that can work, but it is necessary to seize power by force and fundamentally change the social system. In this regard, the armed struggle launched by the peasants of Naxalbari in Darjeeling District under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has set an example for the Indian people.

    印共修正主义分子大卖狗皮膏药
    掩盖印度粮荒的阶级根源，极力为国大党政府涂脂抹粉
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：印度的粮荒，已经发展到空前严重的境地。亿万印度人民正处于饥饿、死亡的苦难之中。这种情况完全是代表地主和官僚买办资产阶级利益的国大党推行极端反动的对内对外政策所造成的。但是，一贯做着“和平过渡”美梦的印共修正主义分子，却极力为印度反动政府涂脂抹粉，掩盖造成粮荒的阶级根源和政治原因，公然替反动统治阶级效劳。
    印共修正主义分子在今年四月间发表的一份关于印度粮食问题的意见书中，集中地暴露了他们的这种卑劣行径。在这份意见书中，他们根本不敢触及印度反动派的罪恶统治制度，根本不敢要印度人民去造印度反动政府的反，却侈谈什么国大党政府应当“进行根本的土地改革”，“停止进口美国粮食”，“征购全部余粮”，“控制全部商品的价格”等等。所有这些与虎谋皮的论调，实际上都是帮助印度反动派对印度人民进行欺骗的鬼话。
      “进行根本的土地改革”吗？在印度农村，确是当务之急。但是，代表地主和官僚买办资产阶级利益的国大党政府，怎么会在印度进行根本的土地改革呢？自一九四七年印度独立以来，国大党政府曾经装模作样地通过了许多关于“土地改革”的法案，而结果却是：农村土地更集中，封建剥削更严重，贫雇农的队伍更扩大。据印度官方的统计，目前占印度农村人口百分之二十的农户占有全部耕地百分之七十五，而占农村人口约百分之八十的农户只占有耕地的百分之二十五，其中占百分之五十的最底层的农户只占有百分之二·七的土地。
    真正的土地改革在印度的确有过，但不是出现在代表地主、官僚买办资产阶级的国大党政府的反动政权统治地区，而是二十年前出现在特仑甘纳武装斗争地区。当那里的起义农民拿起枪杆子，建立起红色政权后，曾经在解放了的地区进行了真正的土地改革，没收地主六百万亩土地，无偿地分配给无地少地农民，使特仑甘纳农民破天荒第一次翻了身。但是恰恰是由于印共修正主义头目的出卖，使得革命农民在武装斗争中夺到的胜利果实全部丧失掉了。
    “停止进口美国粮食”吗？今天的印度，粮食连年减产，美粮进口年年增加。从一九五六年印度同美国按所谓“四八○号公法”签订第一个粮食协定以来，到一九六五年底，印度从美国进口的粮食总共已达三千七百二十八万吨，价值一百十一亿二千万卢比。据透露，美国驻印大使馆手里掌握的卢比总额，估计已占到印度货币总流通量的四分之一到二分之一。美粮倾销（其中很多是腐烂的），喂肥了美国垄断资本和印度官僚买办资本家、地主，也使印度反动政府在政治上日益依附于美帝。印度农村经济因此受到更大摧残，农业人口大批流向城市，使印度政府陷于无法摆脱依赖美粮的困境。曾经担任过粮食部长的一名国大党官员早就公开承认：印度政府“除了尽可能多进口粮食，……别无其它办法。”“不要国外供应粮食就会是自杀。”
    说什么要国大党政府来“征购全部余粮”和“控制全部商品的价格”，更是自欺欺人之谈。目前在印度，不仅粮食黑市猖獗，粮价飞涨，地主和官僚资本家大发其财，就是名义上由政府掌握的配给粮，也由于资本家同官僚政客相勾结，狼狈为奸，大多流入黑市，高价卖出。因此，就连这种定量少得可怜的政府配给粮，饿着肚子的印度老百姓也经常买不到，又怎么能够期望国大党反动政府会“征购”地主和奸商的粮食、“控制”市场商品的价格呢？！
    印度独立二十年来长期严重粮荒、饿殍遍野的现实教育了印度人民：要彻底解决印度的粮荒，决不是那些印共修正主义分子鼓吹的骗人的种种“改革”所能奏效的，而必须武装夺取政权，从根本上改变社会制度。在这方面，大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里农民在印共革命派领导下掀起的武装斗争，为印度人民树立了榜样。
