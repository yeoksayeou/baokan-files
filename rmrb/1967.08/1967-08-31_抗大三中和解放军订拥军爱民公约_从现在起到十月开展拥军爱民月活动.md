The Third Middle School of the Anti-Imperialist University (Dayantan Middle School) in Chaoyang District, Beijing, along with all revolutionary teachers and students, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers assisting with military training, gathered together on August 29. They enthusiastically discussed and unanimously adopted the school's mutual support agreement. Both sides agreed to resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, to raise high the banner of "mutual support," and to launch a mutual support month from now until October, vigorously carrying out mutual support activities.

The Red Guards of the Third Middle School of the Anti-Imperialist University and the PLA soldiers, while discussing the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on launching a larger-scale mutual support movement, recalled their half-year of joint struggle. The Red Guards deeply moved said: The People's Liberation Army is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In military and political training and in the struggle to make revolution, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards, helped revolutionary organizations to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and done a great deal of thorough and detailed ideological work. Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, they promoted the realization of revolutionary great unity in the school's Red Guard organizations. We must strive to learn from the PLA and support the PLA. The PLA soldiers present also expressed their determination to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions on the PLA supporting the broad leftist masses, to firmly rely on and support the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards, and to always be models of loving the people.

After heated discussions, both sides unanimously adopted the following mutual support agreement:

1. Resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and actively assist the PLA in carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

2. Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, believe in and rely on the masses, love and protect the revolutionary masses, love and protect the Red Guards, and love and protect the revolutionary masses.

3. The PLA and the Red Guards should trust, learn from, and support each other, unite closely, and fight shoulder to shoulder.

4. Issues between the military and the people should be resolved according to the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people, through self-criticism and consultation.

5. Enhance revolutionary vigilance, prevent bad elements from stirring up trouble, and consolidate military-civilian unity.
