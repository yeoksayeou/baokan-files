Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao leads us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, in establishing mutual aid cooperatives.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the exploiting classes, namely the landlord and capitalist classes, have not yet been eliminated and cannot be eliminated all at once. The exploiters have been defeated, but they have not yet been annihilated. ... Their resistance is strengthened a thousandfold precisely because of their defeat.

    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，领导我们贫下中农，从办互助
    在无产阶级专政下，剥削者阶级即地主资本家阶级还没有消失，也不可能一下子消失。剥削者已被击溃，可是还没有被消灭。……他们的反抗力正由于他们的失败而增强了千百倍。
