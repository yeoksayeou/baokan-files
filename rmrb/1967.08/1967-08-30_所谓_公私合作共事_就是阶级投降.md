The so-called "public-private cooperation" is nothing but class surrender. The Chinese Khrushchev has long been using the banner of "public-private cooperation" to advocate for "class cooperation," all the while plotting to restore capitalism. He rants on about how "there is comprehensive cooperation, temporary cooperation, and long-term cooperation. We have what is called state capitalism, which is long-term cooperation between private individuals and the state... It is not about deceiving each other, but about complete cooperation."

The "cooperation" that the Chinese Khrushchev praises is a big fraud. Under the guise of "cooperation," he peddles the idea of "class surrender." To please the capitalists, he tells us not to treat them as "outsiders" but to be "open-hearted" and "sincere" with them. He completely blurs the class lines, telling us to obediently "listen" to the bourgeoisie, accept their "reforms," and let them "lead." This is not about "public-private cooperation" at all; it is a complete surrender of power to the bourgeoisie.

Under the black directive of the Chinese Khrushchev, a handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Party who advocate for the capitalist road came to our factory to set up a base. They concocted the so-called "57 Points of Cooperation," claiming that capitalists should have "positions and power" and that we should "respect their leadership." This is a barefaced plan to restore capitalism.

Under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev's black directive of "cooperation," those capitalists who had already been sent to the workshops for labor reform have all returned to their offices, strutting around arrogantly. They have seized positions such as factory director, section chief, and workshop director, usurping the leadership of the enterprise.

After these capitalists seized the leadership, they imposed bourgeois dictatorship on us workers and ordinary cadres. A cadre in one office was scolded by a private factory deputy director for submitting a report late; a livestock keeper in the supply section was made to stand at the door to report to a private section chief because the section chief found him dirty and smelly. This is outrageous! Why, more than a decade after national liberation, are capitalists still so brazen in humiliating us? It is because the Chinese Khrushchev is backing them up. The Chinese Khrushchev is our class enemy!

The "cooperation" that the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates is actually his shameless surrender and submission to the bourgeoisie, a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Didn't he himself openly admit that his cooperation with the capitalists is "not about deceiving each other, but about complete cooperation"? This slip of the tongue reveals the subtle relationship between him and the capitalists. The "cooperation" he actively advocates is to "cooperate" in restoring capitalism and "jointly" walk the capitalist road!

Let me tell you, Chinese Khrushchev, you are dreaming during the day. Your plot will never succeed.

    所谓“公私合作共事”就是阶级投降
    上海日用化学品三厂  工人革命造反队
    中国的赫鲁晓夫长期以来打着“公私合作共事”的旗号，大肆鼓吹“阶级合作”，干着复辟资本主义的勾当。他胡说什么：“公私合作有全面的，有暂时的，有长期的，我们有所谓国家资本主义，是私人和公家的长期合作……不是尔虞我诈，而是完全合作”。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫所吹捧的“合作共事”，是一个大骗局。在“合作共事”的幌子下，他贩卖“阶级投降”的私货。他为了讨好资本家，叫我们把资本家不要当作“外人”看待，应该对他们“推心置腹”，“赤诚相待”。他完全抹煞了阶级界限，叫我们乖乖地“听”资产阶级的话，接受资产阶级的“改造”，由他们来“领导”，这决不是什么“公私合作”问题，而是彻头彻尾地向资产阶级交权、投降。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫这一黑指示下，上海党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，来到了我们日用化学品三厂蹲点，炮制了所谓“合作共事五十七条”，什么要资本家“有职有权”呀，“尊重他们的职务领导”呀，等等，这是一个赤裸裸的复辟资本主义的黑纲领。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的“合作共事”的黑纲领保护下，那些早已下放车间劳动改造的资本家，都又重新回到科室里，趾高气扬，神气起来了。他们分别窃踞了厂长、股长、车间主任等职务，篡夺了企业的领导大权。
    这些资本家在厂里窃踞了领导权之后，对我们工人和一般干部实行了资产阶级专政。有一个科室干部，因为报表交迟了些，就遭到一个私方副厂长拍桌打凳的训斥；总务股里有一个饲养员来向一个私方股长汇报工作，那个私方股长嫌他身上脏，有臭味，就叫他站在门口，离得远一点汇报。这真是岂有此理！为什么在全国解放十多年后资本家还这样猖狂地侮辱我们？就是有中国的赫鲁晓夫给他们撑腰，中国赫鲁晓夫是我们工人阶级的死对头！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫所极力鼓吹的“合作共事”，实际上就是他无耻地向资产阶级进行卖身投靠和屈膝投降，是他对无产阶级革命事业的大出卖。他自己不是已经直言不讳地供认了他和资本家的合作“不是尔虞我诈，而是完全合作”吗？一语泄漏了天机，道出了他和资本家之间的微妙关系。他所积极主张的“合作共事”，就是要和资本家去“合”复辟资本主义之“作”，“共”走资本主义道路之“事”！
    告诉你，中国的赫鲁晓夫，你这是白日作梦，你的阴谋永远也不会得逞。
