According to a report from Xinhua News Agency: New Delhi reports that the armed forces of several ethnic groups in the eastern Indian states of Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur have recently coordinated their operations, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the Indian reactionary military and police.

On July 12, in Tamenglong, Manipur, Naga and Mizo ethnic armed forces ambushed a unit of the Indian Central Reserve Police, killing 24 personnel.

After suffering this heavy blow, the Indian reactionaries panicked and immediately dispatched a large force to the area for a "sweep." The brave ethnic armed forces seized the opportunity to counterattack, delivering a severe blow to the Indian reactionary forces on July 24. The news reached New Delhi, and on July 25, the Minister of Home Affairs, Chavan, had to reveal in the parliament that the government troops had suffered heavy casualties. The Indian News Agency reported on July 26 that 18 Indian military personnel, including one officer, were killed by Kuki ethnic armed forces equipped with automatic weapons. The Indian reactionary government hastily dispatched reinforcements to the area where the battle took place, and all nearby Indian military outposts were also on high alert.

When the Indian reactionary military was conducting a "sweep" in the Tamenglong area, they created a white terror, arresting many innocent civilians for interrogation, attempting to force them to reveal the whereabouts of the Naga armed forces. However, the Indian reactionary military gained nothing from the civilians.

The Naga armed forces had previously mainly operated in Nagaland and the northern parts of Manipur. The Mizo armed forces operated in the Mizo Hills in the southwestern part of Manipur. Now, they are coordinating their efforts to strike the Indian reactionary military and police with even greater force. The Naga armed forces recently expelled some elements who had surrendered to the Indian reactionary government, and their combat effectiveness has been enhanced. The Naga armed struggle against the Indian reactionaries has persisted for over a decade, and the Mizo armed struggle has also continued for more than a year. Their struggles have exposed the myth spread by Indian revisionists that "there are no conditions for armed struggle in India."

According to a report from the Indian News Agency, 125,000 coal miners in 415 coal mines in the Jaria coalfields of Bihar went on strike on June 26, demanding wage increases and the implementation of a rationing system in the coal mining areas.

The same news agency also reported that 20,000 students from various colleges in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, went on strike and held demonstrations on June 26 to protest against the increase in tuition fees. Students from five universities in Rajkot and other places in the state also went on strike.

The *Indian Express* reported that the strike by pilots of Indian Airlines, demanding wage increases and opposing dismissals, entered its third day. This state-owned airline dismissed 419 more employees, bringing the total number of dismissed employees to 649.

According to a report from the Indian News Agency, all personnel, including more than 1,000 sailors and 17 tugboat captains, at the Tollnath Flotilla in Mumbai Port went on strike on June 28, demanding wage increases. This strike brought port shipping to a standstill.

    印度东部民族武装配合作战重创政府军
    印度反动派惊慌万状急忙派重兵“扫荡”遭到惨败
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度东部阿萨姆邦、那加邦和曼尼普尔地区的几个民族的武装力量，最近互相配合作战，一再给予印度反动军警以沉重的打击。
    七月十二日，在曼尼普尔的塔明龙，那加族和米佐部族武装伏击了一支印度中央后备警察部队，打死二十四人。
    印度反动派遭到了这个沉重打击后，惊慌万状，马上派重兵到那个地区去进行“扫荡”。勇敢的民族武装抓住战机进行反击，在二十四日狠狠打击印度反动军队。消息传到新德里，内政部长恰范二十五日不得不在议会上透露，政府军在战斗中伤亡很重。印度报业托辣斯七月二十六日报道，十八名印军人员，包括一名军官，被持有自动武器的库奇部族武装打死。印度反动政府又慌慌张张地派援军到发生战斗的地区去，附近所有的印军哨所也都处于戒备状态。
    当印度反动军队在塔明龙地区“扫荡”时，制造白色恐怖，抓了许多无辜居民进行拷问，企图强迫他们谈出那加族武装的所在地。但是印度反动军队从老百姓身上什么也没捞到。
    那加族武装过去主要在那加邦和曼尼普尔地区北部活动。米佐部族武装在曼尼普尔西南的米佐山区活动。现在，他们互相配合，更加有力地打击印度反动军警。那加族武装最近踢开了一些向印度反动政府屈膝投降的分子，战斗力更加强了。那加族反对印度反动派的武装斗争已经坚持了十多年，米佐部族的武装斗争也坚持了一年多。他们的斗争戳穿了印度修正主义分子散布的所谓“在印度没有条件开展武装斗争”的神话。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，比哈尔邦贾里亚煤田的四百十五个煤矿的十二万五千煤矿工人，六月二十六日举行罢工，要求增加工资和实行煤矿地区配给制度。
    这家通讯社还报道，古吉拉特邦阿默达巴德许多高等院校的两万名学生，六月二十六日罢课并且举行示威，抗议提高学费。这个邦的拉吉科特等五个地方的大学生也罢了课。
    《印度快报》报道，印度航空公司的飞行员为增加工资反对解雇而举行的罢工进入了第三天。这个官办的航空公司又解雇了四百一十九名雇员。这使到目前为止被解雇的雇员人数达到六百四十九人。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，孟买港口托辣斯弗洛蒂拉港的全体人员，包括一千多名水手和十七个拖船船长，六月二十八日举行罢工，要求增加工资。这次罢工使港口航运陷于停顿状态。
