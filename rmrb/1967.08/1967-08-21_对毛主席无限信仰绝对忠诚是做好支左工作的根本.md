Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, breathing the same air, sharing the same fate, and being closely connected with them. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters in Zigong City launched a fierce attack on a handful of capitalist-roaders in the municipal committee, and consequently faced a siege. At this time, we resolutely drew a clear line with the old municipal committee and supported the revolutionary actions of the youngsters. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, we acted promptly, spared no effort, and worked day and night alongside the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. When a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration emerged in March this year, enveloping Zigong in white terror, we remained unshakable, resolutely stood on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, shared their hardships and struggles, and vowed not to lower our revolutionary heads. We fought a resolute battle. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and with the warm care and support of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we finally, together with the broad revolutionary masses, smashed this counter-revolutionary tide. Most of the armed cadres at the municipal, district, and commune levels in our city have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have been "carrying out the revolution and promoting production." Currently, Zigong City is in a great situation, with industrial and agricultural production showing an unprecedented good scene in the past seventeen years. The total industrial output value in the first half of the year increased by 28.9% compared to the same period last year, the yield of winter crops increased by more than 50%, and oil crops increased by more than one fold. Recently, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have achieved revolutionary great unity and have launched a high tide of exposing and criticizing the biggest capitalist-roader in the party.

Why have we been able to stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary left all along?

The words of Chairman Mao are the highest directive for all our actions and the highest standard for distinguishing right from wrong.

In September last year, the revolutionary youngsters of the "Longyuan Combat Team" from the three departments in the capital came to Zigong City to fan the revolutionary wind and ignite the revolutionary fire. The ancient salt city quickly saw big-character posters with arrows pointing at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the municipal committee. These people panicked and quickly deceived some unaware masses, attacking the revolutionary youngsters day and night, labeling them as "monsters and demons," and forcing them to write self-criticisms. Two completely different fronts were thus laid out: one wanted to rise up and rebel, the other wanted to suppress the revolution; one wanted to overthrow, the other wanted to preserve. These two fronts forced everyone to be tested and decide to stand on one side or the other.

At that time, we did not directly intervene in the Cultural Revolution, but the class struggle in society inevitably reflected in the armed department. The armed department had always worked under the leadership of the municipal committee and had a thousand and one connections with the old municipal committee, dealing with many familiar people, with many family members working in local government agencies, and children studying locally. If we had acted according to the "old habits" and "old procedures," if we had considered the "work relations," "feelings," "face," and "personal interests" of the "small family" and "small unit," our buttocks would have easily sat on the side of preserving the old municipal committee and suppressing the rebels. This is a major issue of right and wrong. What should we do at this critical moment?

Comrade Vice Chairman Lin said: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of the great commander-in-chief, we should listen well to the words of our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao. The Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!" Chairman Mao is the most brilliant commander-in-chief. Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal truth. Should we listen well to the words of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, or blindly follow the manipulations of a handful of people in the old municipal committee? Should we be absolutely loyal to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao in revolution, or should we follow a handful of people in the old municipal committee and become their "tame tool"? Should we consider the eternal color of the great motherland, consider creating a red world of Mao Zedong Thought, or should we consider the personal, family, and small unit interests right in front of our eyes? The answer is clear: it must be the former. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do! Whatever Chairman Mao does, we follow! In our hearts, there is only the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must have unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao. The great revolutionary theory and practice of Chairman Mao are the highest directives for all our actions and the highest standards for distinguishing right from wrong. With questions in mind, we study the great works of Chairman Mao, observe the great practice of Chairman Mao, listen to the voice of Chairman Mao coming from Beijing, and review the revolutionary battle course led by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has always supported the revolutionary mass movements. As early as forty years ago, he cheered for the peasant movement in Hunan, praising them as "revolutionary vanguards." Chairman Mao has always supported the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, long ago voicing the heart of the oppressed people around the world: "Rebellion is justified." Chairman Mao has always believed in, relied on, and respected the pioneering spirit of the masses. Chairman Mao has always supported the Red Guards, who are the highest red commanders of the heroic Red Guards.

It is precisely because of our unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that we have, from the very beginning, sided with the revolutionary youngsters in thought and emotion, cheered for their revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and felt indignant about their being attacked and persecuted. Our children participated in the earliest revolutionary organizations that rose up in rebellion. The old municipal committee used both soft and hard tactics on us, trying to "persuade" our children to withdraw, and even spread rumors that "the father is a revolutionary, and the children are counter-revolutionaries." However, we firmly supported our children's revolutionary actions. A family member of ours working in a local government agency posted the first big-character poster in the city exposing the old municipal committee's handful of bad guys for inciting the masses to fight against the students. These guys went mad when they found out and personally arranged for her to be besieged, and even incited some people to threaten to expose her "black backer." We still firmly supported this family member's revolutionary actions. We also compiled the crimes of the old municipal committee's handful of bad guys in stubbornly pushing the capitalist reactionary line into materials and promptly reported them to higher authorities, expressing our determination to stand firmly with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and fight the capitalist reactionary line to the end.

To have unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great innovation in the history of the international communist movement. Only a leader as brilliant as Chairman Mao, a great Marxist-Leninist, has the great courage to launch such a magnificent and world-shaking revolutionary mass movement. In this unprecedented revolutionary mass movement, it is inevitable that some problems are not understood at first. However, we must first believe in one thing: Chairman Mao's leadership is always right, and Mao Zedong Thought is always right. If we do not understand, it is because our stand, viewpoint, and method have problems, and our understanding has lagged behind. At this time, we must more firmly and unshakably act according to the teachings of Chairman Mao, keep up, understand what we understand, and firmly act on what we do not understand. Only by keeping up can we understand; only by acting can we deepen our understanding in practice. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's business. It is often not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning." In the Cultural Revolution, we also adopted this attitude to carry out and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, going deep into the masses and the struggle, improving our understanding in practice. The facts have proven that it is precisely through practice that we have gradually and increasingly understood the great significance of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gradually and increasingly understood Chairman Mao's great theory, line, policy, and principle of carrying out the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and have become more firmly faithful to Mao Zedong Thought and more aware and determined to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In favorable situations, we must have unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao; in unfavorable situations, we must have even more unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the face of storms and waves, we must defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, or waver. This is the test of true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries. In March this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Sichuan Provincial Party launched a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, which swept into Zigong City. Some people accused us of "sitting on the wrong side and making mistakes." They issued so-called "directives" that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought time and time again, trying to shake our direction of supporting the left. We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "Communist Party members must ask why about everything, must think carefully about whether it conforms to reality and whether it is reasonable, and must not blindly follow or advocate slavery." We resolutely resisted such erroneous commands that went against Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought.

Some people distributed leaflets that distorted right and wrong and slandered the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to us, ordering us to print and distribute them. We not only printed and distributed none, but also responded point by point, making clear and uncompromising exposures and criticisms.

Some people said we "sheltered bad people and became a den of 'monsters and demons.'" Big hats did not scare us. Anyone who acts according to Mao Zedong Thought and carries out the revolution along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter where they come from, when, and where, we all regard them as our class brothers and revolutionary comrades, doing our best to solve their difficulties, supporting them in every way, and fighting side by side with them.

Some people used all kinds of despicable means to make us yield, and finally directly persecuted and detained our comrades who were in charge of supporting the left, trying to force us to change direction. We remained unshakable. Our oath is: "We can sit in prison, our heads can be cut off, but our red hearts for Chairman Mao will never change!" We firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the reddest hearts and the bravest spirits. No matter how fierce the storms and waves, they could not shake our determination to resolutely support the revolutionary rebels. "Without destruction, there can be no construction." This is how we thoroughly smashed all non-proletarian thoughts, completely overthrew slavery, and firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. The broad revolutionary masses saw our firm attitude and said in emotion: "You are truly the red armed department of Chairman Mao, truly the strong backbone of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!"

To have unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, we must first carry out education on the struggle between the two lines, so that everyone understands the real class struggle in society, knows what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and what is the capitalist reactionary line. Only by carrying out this education can we make all comrades always maintain a firm stand and a clear mind, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely oppose the capitalist reactionary line.

For cadres working in the department, we allowed them to go out to read big-character posters, listen to debates, and bring back various questions for free discussion. Then, with real problems and active thoughts, we seriously studied the works of Chairman Mao, especially repeatedly studied the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and Chairman Mao's series of important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as important editorials published in the "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "Liberation Army Daily." Through continuous study, we kept up with the situation of the Cultural Revolution.

For armed cadres at various levels, we often organized concentrated study sessions, focusing on the struggle between the two lines to solve many major cognitive problems. We also educated the broad masses of militia through them to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, become the backbone of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and be the vanguard in fighting against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

For soldiers, the main leading cadres of the armed department often gave them reports. The soldiers' desire to know about state affairs was as strong as that of the cadres and could not be restricted by "prohibitions" to limit their understanding and thinking about the class struggle in society. If they had any questions they did not understand, the leaders helped them understand, and they were given some convenient conditions to go out and see the big-character posters, come back to study the works of Chairman Mao, and have discussions. In this way, the soldiers had a basic understanding and recognition of the situation of the struggle between the two lines in society and could more consciously stand on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

For family members, when we found that some people were inciting them to besiege revolutionary students, we immediately strengthened their education. We established a study system among family members, studying several times a week to clarify vague understandings. We also required cadres and family members to strengthen the education of their children.

Because we had grasped the education on the struggle between the two lines within the department early and deeply, our armed department gradually formed a fighting collective that was firmly on the side of the revolutionary left in thought, emotion, language, and action, and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This laid a good ideological and mass foundation for our work of supporting the left. After Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, we elected comrades such as Vice Director Li Zongbo to form a team to lead the work of supporting the left under the leadership of the party committee. These comrades are the most resolute executors and defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and are recognized by the masses as the most steadfast revolutionary leftists.

We feel that it is important to always grasp the education on the struggle between the two lines within the department, lay a good ideological and mass foundation for the work of supporting the left, and establish a firm team for supporting the left on this foundation.

With such a foundation and such a team, we can more accurately identify the leftists, so that the work of supporting the left will not have problems in direction and line.

With such a foundation and such a team, we can greatly mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres, soldiers, and family members for the work of supporting the left, thinking what the revolutionary masses think and helping what the revolutionary masses need. The revolutionary masses regard the armed department as their own home, and we also regard the revolutionary masses as our own family.

With such a foundation and such a team, we can continuously eliminate the interference of conservative thoughts, always insist on the correct direction of the work of supporting the left, and firmly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, to continuously achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Over the past year, through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that unlimited faith and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the fundamental principles for doing a good job in supporting the left and are also the fundamental principles for doing a good job in all work.

    对毛主席无限信仰绝对忠诚是做好支左工作的根本
    中国人民解放军四川省自贡市人民武装部
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们自始至终坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们同呼吸，共命运，血肉相连。文化大革命初期，自贡市的革命小将向市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，因而受到围攻。这时候，我们坚决和旧市委划清界线，支持革命小将的革命行动。当伟大领袖毛主席发出人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召后，我们闻风而动，全力以赴，夜以继日地和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗。当今年三月出现一股资本主义复辟的逆流，白色恐怖笼罩着自贡的时候，我们毫不动摇，坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们同甘苦，共战斗，誓死不低革命头，进行了坚决的斗争，在伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策下，在中央文革小组的亲切关怀和支持下，我们终于和广大革命群众一道，粉碎了这股反革命逆流。我们市、区、公社各级武装干部，绝大多数都坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和无产阶级革命派一起“抓革命，促生产”。目前，自贡市一片大好形势，工农业生产出现了十七年来从未有过的大好景象。上半年工业总产值比去年同期增长百分之二十八点九，小春粮食增产百分之五十以上，油料作物增产一倍以上。最近，无产阶级革命派已经实现了革命大联合，掀起了对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判的高潮。
    我们为什么能够始终坚定地站在革命左派一边呢？
    毛主席的话，是我们一切行动的最高指示，是鉴别一切是非的最高标准
    去年九月，首都三司“长缨战斗队”的革命小将，到自贡市来煽革命之风，点革命之火。古老的盐都很快出现了矛头指向市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大字报。这一小撮人慌了手脚，赶忙蒙骗一些不明真相的群众，通宵达旦地围攻革命小将，把他们打成“牛鬼蛇神”，逼他们写检讨。两个截然不同的阵线就这样摆开了：一方要起来革命造反，一方要压制革命造反；一方要革，一方要保。这两个阵线迫使每一个人受到检验和决定弃取：是站在这一方，还是站在那一方？
    当时，我们没有直接介入文化大革命，但是，社会上的阶级斗争，必然要反映到武装部来。武装部一直是在市委领导下工作，和旧市委有着千丝万缕的联系，打交道多，熟人多，许多家属在地方机关工作，子女在地方就学。如果按“老习惯”、“老规程”办事，如果从“工作关系”、“感情”、“面子”和“小家庭”、“小单位”等个人的眼前利害关系去考虑，屁股就很容易坐到保旧市委一方，压制造反的一方。这是一个大是大非的问题。在这个关键时刻怎么办？
    林副主席说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”毛主席是最英明的统帅。毛泽东思想是永恒的真理。我们是好好听伟大统帅毛主席的话，还是盲从旧市委一小撮人的摆弄？是无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席，紧紧跟随毛主席干革命，还是追随旧市委的一小撮人，做他们的“驯服工具”？是考虑伟大祖国千秋万代不变颜色，考虑创建一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界，还是考虑个人、家属、小单位眼皮子底下的一点利害得失？回答是肯定的，只能是前者。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做！毛主席怎么做，我们就跟着怎么做！我们心目中只有毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们就是要对毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚。毛主席的伟大革命理论，毛主席的伟大革命实践，就是我们一切行动的最高指示，就是鉴别一切是非的最高标准。我们带着问题，学毛主席的伟大著作，看毛主席的伟大实践，听北京传来的毛主席的声音，回顾毛主席率领我们闹革命的战斗历程。毛主席他老人家最最支持革命的群众运动，早在四十年前，就为湖南的农民运动高呼“好得很”，称誉他们是“革命先锋”。毛主席他老人家最最支持革命造反精神，早就呼出了全世界被压迫人民的心声：“造反有理。”毛主席他老人家最最相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。毛主席最最支持红卫兵，是英雄的红卫兵的最高红司令。
    正是出于对毛主席革命路线的无限信仰，绝对忠诚，我们从思想感情上一开始就倒向革命小将一边，为他们的革命造反精神叫好，为他们受到打击迫害感到愤慨。我们的子女参加了最早起来造反的革命组织，旧市委对我们软硬兼施，要我们“说服”子女退出去，还散布“老子革命，儿女反革命”的流言蜚语，但是我们坚决支持子女的革命行动。我们在地方机关工作的一位家属，贴出了全市第一张揭露旧市委一小撮坏家伙挑动群众斗学生的革命大字报。这些家伙知道以后，暴跳如雷，亲自布置对她的围攻，还煽动一些人扬言要揪出她的“黑后台”。我们还是坚决支持这个家属的革命行动。我们还把旧市委一小撮坏家伙顽固推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行，整理成材料及时向上反映，表示我们坚决同无产阶级革命派站在一起，坚决和资产阶级反动路线斗争到底的决心。
    对毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动史上一个伟大的创举。只有毛主席这样英明的无产阶级革命导师，这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，才有这样伟大的气魄，发动这样轰轰烈烈的震撼世界的革命群众运动。在这场史无前例的革命群众运动中，有些问题暂时不理解是难免的。但是，要首先坚信一条：毛主席的领导千正确万正确，毛泽东思想千正确万正确。所以不理解，是自己的立场、观点、方法有了问题，是自己的认识掉了队。这时，我们更要坚定不移地按照毛主席的教导去做，紧紧跟上，理解的要坚决照办，暂时不理解的也坚决照办。只有紧跟，才能理解；只有照办，才能在实践中加深理解。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”在文化大革命中贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们也是抱的这种态度，深入群众，深入斗争实际，在实践中提高认识。事实证明，我们正是通过实践，才逐步较多地领会了这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，逐步较多地理解了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大理论、路线、方针和政策，更加坚定了对毛泽东思想的无限信仰，更加增强了执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性和坚定性。
    在顺利的情况下，要对毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚；在不顺利的情况下，更要对毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚。在狂风恶浪面前，对毛主席的革命路线是誓死捍卫，还是摇摆不定，这是考验真革命和假革命的关口。今年三月，四川省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派掀起的一股资本主义复辟逆流，卷进了自贡市。某些人指责我们“屁股坐歪了，搞错了。”一次又一次地下达不符合毛泽东思想的所谓“指示”，妄图动摇我们支左的大方向。我们遵照毛主席关于“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义”的教导，对这种违背毛泽东思想的错误指挥，进行了坚决抵制，保证了毛泽东思想的绝对领导。
    某些人把一些颠倒黑白、诽谤无产阶级革命派的传单发给我们，命令我们翻印散发。我们不但一张不印，一张不发，而且针锋相对，进行毫不含糊的揭露和批判。
    某些人说我们“包庇了坏人，成了‘牛鬼蛇神’的黑窝子。”大帽子没有把我们吓软。凡是按照毛泽东思想办事，凡是沿着毛主席的革命路线闹革命的无产阶级革命派，不管来自何省何县，在何时何地，我们统统看做是自己的阶级兄弟、革命战友，尽一切力量解决他们的困难，从各个方面支持他们，和他们并肩战斗。
    某些人玩弄了种种卑鄙手段没有使我们屈从，最后便直接对我们主持支左工作的同志打击迫害，进行隔离管押，企图胁迫我们扭转大方向。我们还是毫不动摇。我们的誓言是：“牢可坐，头可断，坚信毛主席的红心永不变！”我们坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，心最红，胆最壮，任何险风恶浪，也动摇不了我们坚决支持革命造反派的决心。“不破不立”，我们就是这样大破一切非无产阶级思想，彻底打倒奴隶主义，在头脑中牢固树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。广大革命群众看见我们这样坚定的态度，感动地说：“你们不愧为毛主席的红色武装部，不愧为无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾！”
      以毛泽东思想为指针，搞好两条路线斗争的教育
    要做到对毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚，必须首先搞好两条路线斗争的教育，让所有人员对社会的现实阶级斗争有正确的理解，懂得什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线。只有搞好这个教育，才能使全体同志始终保持坚定的立场和清醒的头脑，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线。
    对于在机关工作的干部，我们放手让他们上街看大字报，听辩论，带着各种问题回来自由讨论，有什么问题，有什么活思想都摆出来。然后，带着现实问题和活思想，认真学习毛主席著作，特别是反复学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重要指示，以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》发表的重要社论。通过不断学习，使大家紧紧跟上文化大革命的形势。
    对于各级专职武装干部，我们经常集中组织学习，以两条路线斗争为纲，集中解决许多重大认识问题。并通过他们对民兵进行两条路线斗争的教育，教育广大民兵坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，做无产阶级革命派中的骨干，做向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争的先锋。
    对于战士，武装部的主要领导干部经常给他们作报告。战士们关心国家大事的愿望，和干部一样强烈，不能用下“禁令”的办法，去限制他们对社会阶级斗争情况的了解和思考。他们有什么问题不理解，领导就帮助他们理解，给他们敞开地讲一些情况。并给一些方便条件，让他们出去看看大字报，回来学习毛主席著作，座谈讨论。这样做，战士们对社会上两条路线斗争的情况就有了基本的了解和认识，就能够比较自觉地站在无产阶级革命派一边。
    对于家属，当我们发现有人挑动她们去围攻革命学生的时候，立即抓紧了对她们的教育。在家属中建立了学习制度，每周都要学习几次，澄清模糊认识。我们还要求干部和家属加强对子女的教育。
    由于较早较深地抓紧了内部的两条路线斗争教育，我们武装部逐步形成了一个从思想、感情、语言、行动都坚决向革命左派一边倒的战斗集体，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。这给我们的支左工作打下了很好的思想基础和群众基础。毛主席发出人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召以后，我们推举了副部长李宗伯等同志组成一个班子，在党委领导下主持支左工作。这些同志是毛主席革命路线最坚决的执行者和捍卫者，是群众公认的最坚定的革命左派。
    我们感到，始终抓紧内部的两条路线斗争教育，打好支左工作的思想基础和群众基础，并在这个基础上建立一个坚定的支左工作班子，是完成支左任务的重要条件。
    有了这样一个基础和这样一个班子，才可以更准确地识别左派，使支左工作不致在方向路线上出问题。
    有了这样一个基础和这样一个班子，才能大大发挥干部、战士、家属对支左工作的高度积极性，想革命派之所想，帮革命派之所需。革命派把武装部当成自己的家，我们也把革命派看成家里的人。
    有了这样一个基础和这样一个班子，才能不断排除保守思想的干扰，始终坚持支左工作的正确方向，坚定地沿着毛主席的革命路线，和无产阶级革命派一起，不断地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
              ×××
    一年多来，通过无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我们深深地体会到：对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限信仰，绝对忠诚，是做好支左工作的根本，也是做好一切工作的根本。
