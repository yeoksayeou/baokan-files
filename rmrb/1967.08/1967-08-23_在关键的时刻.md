	At the Crucial Moment

	Shijingshan Power Plant  Mao Zedong Thought East is Red Corps

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, without the great Chinese People's Liberation Army as the staunch backbone of the revolutionary masses, it would be impossible to achieve a thorough victory.

	In the storm of the "January Revolution," we seized power from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. However, the class enemies were not willing to accept their defeat and continued to use various means to deceive and incite some of the unaware masses to attack the East is Red Corps and secretly plot to seize power back. At this crucial moment, Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army. After they entered the factory, they conducted a thorough investigation and firmly supported us, the East is Red Corps. We were greatly encouraged and deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army, under the personal command of Vice Chairman Lin, is indeed a great army created by Chairman Mao. They always stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary masses.

	When the PLA comrades first arrived, the class struggle situation in our factory was extremely sharp and complex. The other faction in our factory had severe antagonism towards the East is Red Corps. At that time, we thought: the PLA supporting us is a certainty, because the East is Red Corps is one of the earliest members of the Beijing Workers' Revolutionary Committee. However, things turned out differently from our expectations. On the morning after the PLA comrades entered the factory, they summoned the leaders of both factions to discuss the study of Chairman Mao's works and proposed that both sides should sit together to study. We were puzzled and couldn't understand: how could two opposing factions study Chairman Mao's works together? Isn't this just smoothing things over? The PLA comrades noticed our thoughts and immediately talked to us, saying:

	"We revolutionary masses must first be absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The majority of comrades who have taken the wrong side are good people and are our class brothers. We must unite them and direct the spearhead of our struggle against our common enemy—the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party." We carefully considered these words and found them reasonable. How can we unite the majority of comrades to make a revolution? Only the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon. If we do not study together and help each other, how can we understand each other? At the same time, by sitting together, we gradually eliminate the barriers and further isolate the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is not smoothing things over; this is precisely because the PLA comrades firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution."

	Later, with the help of the PLA comrades, both sides conducted a revolutionary big criticism together, directing the spearhead of our struggle against our common enemy—the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his poisonous weed "Cultivation of the Self," and exposed and criticized the crimes of the capitalist-roaders within our unit. The deceived masses and cadres denounced the reactionary "tame tool theory" and "bloodline theory," and eliminated the poison of these reactionary theories. They all rose up to rebel, turning against their former allies, exposing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders within the Party who deceived some of the unaware masses and cadres and plotted to seize power back from the East is Red Corps. They all posted "rebellion declarations," requesting to join the revolutionary organization. Later, the PLA comrades helped us study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and held a sharing meeting throughout the factory. Soon, we absorbed most of the deceived masses into the East is Red Corps, welcoming them to fight together with us. In this way, our forces developed from originally accounting for 50% of the total number of people in the factory to 80%, gradually realizing the great unity of the revolution and creating good conditions for achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	In the future, we will more firmly unite with the PLA, fight together, and achieve victory together, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    在关键的时刻
    石景山发电厂  毛泽东思想东方红兵团
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，如果没有伟大的中国人民解放军作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，要取得彻底胜利是不可能的。
    在“一月革命”的风暴中，我们从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里夺了权。但是，阶级敌人并不甘心自己的失败，继续采用各种手段蒙蔽和挑动一部分不明真相的群众，攻击东方红兵团，并阴谋策划反夺权。在这个关键时刻，毛主席他老人家派来了人民解放军。他们进厂以后，经过了一番深入细致的调查，坚定不移地支持我们东方红兵团。我们受到了极大的鼓舞，深深体会到人民解放军不愧是毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席亲自指挥的伟大军队，他们总是旗帜鲜明地站在无产阶级革命派一边。
    解放军同志刚来的时候，我厂阶级斗争形势十分尖锐、复杂。我们厂的另一派组织和我们东方红兵团的对立情绪非常严重。当时我们想：解放军支持我们，是不成问题的，因为我们东方红兵团是北京工代会的最早成员之一。可是，事情出乎我们的意料，解放军同志进厂的第二天早晨，就把我们和另一派组织的负责人召集在一起，商量学习毛主席著作的问题，并且提出：双方要坐在一起学习。我们很纳闷，怎么也想不通：两个对立的组织怎能在一起学习毛主席著作呢？这不是抹稀泥吗？解放军同志发现了我们的活思想，马上找我们谈心说：
  “我们革命派必须首先无限忠于毛泽东思想，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。站错了队的绝大多数同志是好的，是我们的阶级兄弟，我们必须团结他们，把斗争的矛头指向我们的共同敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。”我们仔细地考虑了这些话，觉得有道理。怎样才能团结大多数同志一块闹革命呢？只有战无不胜的毛泽东思想才是最有力的武器。如果我们不在一起学习、互相帮助，怎么能互相了解呢？同时，我们坐在一起，逐步消除隔阂，就更加孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这不是抹稀泥，这正是因为解放军同志牢牢记住了毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    后来，我们又在解放军同志的帮助下，双方在一起进行革命的大批判，把斗争的矛头指向我们共同的敌人——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的大毒草《修养》，并对本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行进行揭露和批判。受蒙蔽的群众和干部控诉了反动的“驯服工具论”和“血统论”，肃清了这些反动理论的流毒。他们纷纷起来造反了，反戈一击，揭发了党内走资本主义道路的当权派欺骗一部分不明真相的群众和干部，阴谋策划向东方红兵团反夺权的大量罪行。他们纷纷贴出“造反声明”，要求加入革命组织。后来，解放军同志又同我们一起学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，并在全厂召开了讲用会。不久，我们吸收了大部分受蒙蔽的群众加入东方红兵团，欢迎他们同我们共同战斗。这样，我们的队伍由原来占全厂总人数的百分之五十，发展到百分之八十，逐步实现了革命的大联合，并为实现革命的“三结合”创造了良好的条件。
    今后，我们将更加坚定地和解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
