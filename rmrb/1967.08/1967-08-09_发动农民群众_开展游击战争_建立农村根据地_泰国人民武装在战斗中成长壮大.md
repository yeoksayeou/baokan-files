The Thai people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, have been waging armed struggle in the northeastern region of Thailand for the past two years. Through numerous battles, the Thai people's armed forces have grown stronger and dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its puppet regime in Thailand. Currently, the Thai people's armed forces are conducting guerrilla warfare and armed propaganda activities in more than 20 out of the 71 provinces nationwide.

The Thai people's armed forces have grown stronger through fearless resistance, self-sacrifice, and brave combat. Since their establishment, the Thanom-Praphas regime has dispatched armed police to "suppress" them, attempting to extinguish the sparks of revolution. In these "suppression" operations, U.S. "military advisors" have taken command, and U.S. "airborne troops" have directly participated in the fighting. The heroic Thai people's armed forces, with their mobile and flexible tactics, have shattered the enemy's repeated "suppression" attempts and expanded their own ranks. In less than two years, the people's armed forces in the northeast alone have killed and wounded over 700 enemy personnel, including several U.S. military officers.

Recently, the Thai people's armed forces have successfully thwarted the U.S.-Thai reactionaries' "dry season suppression." From last November to June 4 this year, the people's armed forces engaged in 172 battles with reactionary military police, initiating 62 attacks and ambushes against the enemy, annihilating 258 reactionary military police and local reactionary officials. Additionally, they killed and wounded 81 spies. The people's armed forces also seized a large quantity of weapons from the enemy to arm themselves.

The Thai people's armed forces are learning from warfare and continuously leveraging the mobility and flexibility of guerrilla warfare to strike the enemy. On August 1, the Thai people's armed forces ambushed a "pacification" force in the mountainous region of the central province of Phetchabun, destroying their jeeps with landmines and annihilating 10 police officers and policemen, including the deputy police commander of the province, Colonel Kamnan. In early May, in the northern province of Chiang Rai's Thoeng district, the people's armed forces, in response to the reactionaries' "suppression," adopted tactics of concentrating superior forces to strike the enemy's weakest points, and then dividing, encircling, and annihilating them. In this battle, the people's armed forces killed 16 enemy personnel, wounded 20, captured 11, and seized a large quantity of weapons, achieving victory in the anti-"suppression" campaign.

The Thai people's armed forces are fighting a just struggle against U.S. imperialism, and their soldiers understand that they are fighting for the people and the nation's interests. Therefore, they fight bravely and can overcome great difficulties. For example, the people's armed forces in the village of Lang Hin in Nakhon Phanom province, last November, in resisting the "suppression" by a force of over 1,000 reactionary military police commanded by a U.S. military officer, displayed heroic and tenacious fighting spirit and achieved victory. In this 21-hour battle, the people's armed forces repeatedly repulsed the enemy's frontal assaults under the cover of helicopters and artillery, and then, taking the enemy by surprise, attacked their command post from the rear and finally broke through the encirclement. In this battle, the people's armed forces annihilated 87 enemy personnel, including two U.S. military officers.

Currently, the Thai people's armed forces are actively mobilizing the peasant masses in rural areas to create conditions for further developing and expanding guerrilla zones. The peasant masses are enthusiastically providing grain to support the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces are also leading the masses in struggles against traitors and local tyrants, eliminating harm, and are warmly welcomed by the peasant masses.

    发动农民群众　开展游击战争　建立农村根据地
    泰国人民武装在战斗中成长壮大
    据新华社八日讯　本社记者报道：自从泰国共产党领导的人民武装两年前在泰国东北部地区点燃了武装斗争的火焰以来，泰国人民武装经过多次战斗的考验，正在迅速发展壮大，给予美帝国主义及其走狗泰国傀儡集团以沉重的打击。现在，泰国人民武装在全国七十一个府中的二十多个府展开了游击战和武装宣传队的活动。
    泰国人民武装是在不畏强暴、不怕牺牲、英勇战斗中成长壮大起来的。自从人民武装成立的那一天起，他侬—巴博集团就出动武装警察进行“围剿”，力图扑灭革命的星星之火。反动军警在“围剿”中，由美国“军事顾问”充当指挥，美国的“空中突击队”也直接参加了战斗。英雄的泰国人民武装以机动灵活的战术粉碎了敌人一次又一次的“围剿”，壮大了自己的队伍。在不到两年的时间里，人民武装仅在东北部就打死打伤敌人七百多名，其中包括一些美国侵略军军官。
    最近，泰国人民武装胜利地粉碎了美泰反动派的“旱季围剿”。从去年十一月到今年六月四日，人民武装同反动军警战斗一百七十二次，主动袭击敌人和伏击敌人六十二次，共歼灭了反动军警和地方反动官员共二百五十八人。此外还打死打伤特务八十一名。人民武装还从敌人手中夺取了大量武器来武装自己。
    泰国人民武装从战争中学习战争，正在不断发挥游击战的机动性和灵活性，给敌人以打击。八月一日，泰国人民武装在中部巴蜀府山区伏击前来镇压当地人民的所谓“征剿部队”，用地雷炸毁了他们所乘的吉普车，歼灭这支部队的警官和警察十人，打死了这个府的警察副指挥甘曼中校。五月初在北部清莱府的廷县，人民武装在反击反动派的“围剿”中，采取了集中优势兵力打击敌人的最薄弱环节，并且加以分割、包围和歼灭的战术。在这一战役中，人民武装打死敌人十六名，打伤二十名，俘虏十一名，并且缴获了大量武器，取得了反“围剿”的胜利。
    由于泰国人民武装的反美救国斗争是正义的斗争，人民武装的战士都认识到自己是为人民和民族的利益而战斗，因而打起仗来英勇无畏，能够克服巨大的困难。例如，那空拍侬府廊希南村的人民武装，去年十一月在抗击一支由美国军官亲自指挥的两个团一千多名泰国反动军警的“围剿”中，就发挥了英勇顽强的战斗精神，取得了胜利。在这次历时二十一个小时的战斗中，人民武装多次击退了敌人在直升飞机和大炮掩护下的正面进攻，最后出其不意的绕到敌后，直捣敌人的指挥部，然后胜利突围。在这次战斗中，人民武装歼灭敌人八十七人，其中包括打死的两名美国军官。
    泰国人民武装目前正在农村地区积极发动农民群众，为进一步发展和扩大游击地区创造条件。农民群众纷纷拿出粮食来支援人民武装。人民武装还领导群众进行锄奸反霸的斗争，为民除害，受到了农民群众的衷心欢迎。
