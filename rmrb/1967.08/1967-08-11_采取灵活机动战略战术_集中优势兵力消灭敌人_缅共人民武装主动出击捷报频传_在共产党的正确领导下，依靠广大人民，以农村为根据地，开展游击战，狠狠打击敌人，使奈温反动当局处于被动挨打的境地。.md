The Burmese Communist Party-led armed forces have recently launched proactive attacks across the country, achieving numerous victories. The victories of the armed forces on the battlefield are a powerful punishment and heavy blow to the madly anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people Ne Win reactionary regime, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people.

According to Burmese newspapers, since the rainy season began, the armed forces have continuously attacked more than ten towns and train stations, achieving brilliant results. On the night of May 13, about 200 armed forces attacked and captured the important town of Kyaukpadaung on the Yangon-Pyay railway line. They used landmines to destroy the "Socialist Program Party" headquarters in the town, burned down the administrative offices of the Ne Win clique, and ten state-run shops.

On May 27, the armed forces attacked the town of Pyapon in the Irrawaddy Delta, burning down several government buildings and cars of the Ne Win reactionary government, and annihilating a large number of reactionary soldiers and police.

On May 29, during the attack on Kanyutkwin in the Taungoo region, the armed forces fully utilized their strength in night battles. The armed forces first turned off all the lights at the train station and then set fire to a government warehouse. At this time, the reactionary soldiers and police of the Ne Win regime panicked and rushed to extinguish the fire. About 100 armed forces seized this opportunity to launch a fierce attack from the east, north, and south, catching the enemy off guard. The battle lasted about two hours, during which the armed forces seized a batch of combat supplies and withdrew victoriously.

On the night of June 14, about 300 armed forces also attacked the town of Kyauktaw south of Pyinmana.

In the battles, the armed forces adopted flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, often conducting ambushes, concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's combat effectiveness. On July 11, the armed forces conducted an ambush on the Pakokku-Taungoo road, completely annihilating a combined patrol team of 25 reactionary soldiers and police from the Ne Win clique, including a lieutenant and 12 others killed, and 13 wounded; they also seized a batch of mortars, machine guns, American-made automatic rifles, and ammunition. On the same day, the armed forces conducted an ambush in Minbu County, annihilating a platoon of reactionary police. At that time, the reactionary police's cars were passing over a bridge, and the clever armed forces seized this opportunity to surround and attack from all sides, catching the enemy off guard. As a result, seven police were killed and two were seriously injured.

The armed forces are also active near various transportation lines, destroying bridges and intercepting reactionary government convoys. On June 7, the armed forces blew up eight bridges on the Lashio-Mogok road in one operation. On July 10, the armed forces intercepted ten large trucks of the Ne Win reactionary government on the Htonebo-Pyay road.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, with the support of the broad masses of the people, and using rural areas as their base, the Burmese armed forces have launched guerrilla warfare, severely striking and annihilating the enemy, making the Ne Win reactionary regime panic-stricken and in a passive position of being beaten everywhere.

    缅共人民武装主动出击捷报频传
    在共产党的正确领导下，依靠广大人民，以农村为根据地，开展游击战，狠狠打击敌人，使奈温反动当局处于被动挨打的境地。
    新华社十日讯　仰光消息：缅甸共产党领导的人民武装，最近在全国各地主动出击，打了很多漂亮仗。人民武装在战场上的胜利，是对疯狂反华反共反人民的奈温反动当局的有力惩罚和沉重打击，大长了革命人民的志气。
    据缅甸报纸报道，进入雨季以来，人民武装连续袭击了十几个城镇和火车站，取得了辉煌的战绩。五月十三日夜，人民武装约二百人攻克仰光—卑谬铁路线上的重镇九彬高。他们用地雷炸毁了该镇的“社会主义纲领党”的党部，烧毁了奈温集团的行政机关以及十家官办商店。
    五月二十七日，人民武装袭击伊洛瓦底江三角洲的壁磅县城，烧毁了奈温反动政府的一些机关和汽车，歼灭了大批反动军警。
    五月二十九日，人民武装在攻打东吁地区的卡纽昆时，充分发挥了他们打夜战的特长。人民武装首先到火车站把那里所有的电灯都弄灭了，然后火烧反动政府的一座仓库。这时，奈温当局的反动军警慌了手脚，连忙赶去救火。人民武装约一百多人抓住这一有利时机，从东部、北部和南部向这个市镇发起猛攻，把敌人打得昏头转向。战斗进行了约两个小时，人民武装缴获了一批作战物资，胜利而去。
    六月十四日深夜，人民武装约三百人还袭击了彪关以南的皎塔加镇。
    人民武装在战斗中采取机动灵活的战略战术，常常进行伏击战，集中优势兵力，歼灭敌人的有生力量。七月十一日，人民武装在包康—东吁公路上进行伏击，全歼奈温集团反动军警的一支联合巡逻队二十五人，其中包括陆军中尉在内的十二人被打死，十三人受伤；还缴获了一批迫击炮、机枪、美制自动步枪和弹药。同一天，人民武装在敏巫县的一次伏击中，消灭反动警察一个班。当时，这批反动警察的汽车正在通过一座桥，机智的人民战士抓住这一有利战机，从四面进行包围，打得敌人措手不及。结果，七个警察被打死，二人受了重伤。
    人民武装还活跃在各地交通运输线附近，破坏桥梁，截击反动政府的车队。六月七日，人民武装一次就炸毁乐可—茅治公路线上的八座桥梁。七月十日，人民武装在屋敦—卑谬公路线上，截获奈温反动政府大卡车十辆。
    缅甸人民武装在共产党的正确领导下，有广大人民群众作靠山，以农村为根据地，开展游击战，狠狠打击和消灭敌人，使奈温反动当局惶惶不可终日，处于到处被动挨打的境地。
