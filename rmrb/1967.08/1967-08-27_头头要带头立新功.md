Chairman Mao teaches us: "Leaders must always be at the forefront of the movement, not lagging behind it." At present, leaders at all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must heed Chairman Mao's words, stand at the forefront of the movement, and take the lead in participating in the revolutionary criticism movement.

Leaders taking the lead in participating in the revolutionary criticism movement means taking the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which is to grasp the current major class struggle and the direction of the struggle. Without revolutionary criticism, one will lose the direction of the struggle; without revolutionary criticism, one will betray the revolution.

Currently, some responsible comrades still do not understand, are not serious about, or are ineffective in the revolutionary criticism movement. Therefore, the phenomenon of "soldiers advancing while leaders lagging behind; grassroots advancing while leadership lags behind" has emerged. This is worth noting.

Some responsible comrades are busy all day dealing with daily affairs, running around, working hard, but not focusing on the revolutionary criticism. In fact, no matter what they do, if they do not focus on revolutionary criticism, it is all in vain. Only by thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically can we clarify our direction, enhance our immunity, and always resist the infiltration of the bourgeois reactionary line. Only in this way can we consolidate our power and ensure that we do not take the capitalist path. If we do not thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and completely eliminate its poison and influence, we will not be able to clearly distinguish between the two headquarters, see the struggle between the two roads, and how can we continue to correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? This is a very serious issue!

Comrade Lin Biao recently called for: "Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We hope that the leaders of the revolutionary faction will not rest on their past achievements but will take the lead in achieving new merits. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve new merits for the Party and the people in the revolutionary criticism and in the decisive battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and only then can we be worthy of being good cadres and leaders loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Let us, the leaders of all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations, take further action!

    头头要带头立新功
    毛主席教导我们：“领导一定要走在运动的前面，不要落在它的后面。”当前，各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织的负责人，一定要听毛主席的话，站在运动的前面，带头投入革命大批判运动。
    领导带头投入革命大批判运动，就是带头贯彻毛主席的革命路线，就是抓住了当前最大的阶级斗争，抓住了斗争的大方向。离开了革命大批判就会迷失斗争的大方向，忘记了革命大批判就会背叛革命。
    目前，有些负责同志，对革命大批判运动还是很不理解，很不认真，很不得力。因此，出现了“战士先进，头头落后；基层先进，领导落后”的现象。这是值得引起注意的。
    有些负责同志整天忙于应付日常事务，东奔西跑，辛辛苦苦，就是不抓革命的大批判。其实，千抓万抓，不抓革命的大批判就是瞎抓。只有从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭，才能使我们明辨方向，增强免疫力，时刻抵制资产阶级反动路线的侵蚀，才能巩固我们的政权，保证我们自己不走上资本主义的邪路。如果不彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，不彻底肃清其流毒和影响，我们就会划不清楚两个司令部的界限，看不清楚还有两条道路的斗争，这怎么能继续正确地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线？这是一个多么严肃的问题啊！
    林彪副主席最近发出号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”希望我们革命派的“头头”们，千万不要躺在以往成绩的沙发上逍遥起来，而要带头立新功。我们只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命的大批判中，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的总决战中，为党为人民立新功，才不愧为忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部、好领导。各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织的负责同志，让我们进一步行动起来吧！
