The rotten and barbaric British imperialism has occupied our country's territory of Hong Kong for over a hundred years.

As early as the 1630s, British imperialism began to infiltrate China economically. In the 1880s of that century, Britain officially established a trading post in Guangzhou. Later, it repeatedly demanded that the Qing dynasty's feudal government open more ports and cede islands, engaging in aggressive activities against China. After the 1830s, British imperialism ruthlessly imported large quantities of opium into China. In 1840, British imperialism launched a large-scale war of aggression against China—the Opium War. The British invading army attacked Guangdong. Due to the brave resistance of the people and troops of Guangzhou, the British army could not succeed, so they advanced north to attack Tianjin. The corrupt Qing dynasty feudal government decided to surrender under British imperialist military pressure and completely withdrew the troops defending Guangzhou. In 1841, the British invading army launched a major attack on Nanjing. The Qing government humbly sought peace and was forced to sign the treacherous "Treaty of Nanjing" in 1842, stipulating the cession of Hong Kong Island to Britain.

In 1856, Britain launched the Second Opium War. It allied with France to form the Anglo-French Allied Forces, captured Guangzhou, and attacked Beijing. The Qing government was again forced to sign the "Treaty of Beijing" with Britain in 1860, stipulating the cession of the "Kowloon District" area (currently the area south of Boundary Street on the Kowloon Peninsula) to Britain.

In 1898, British imperialism, taking advantage of the Qing government's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, and using the pretext that France's lease of Guangzhou Bay threatened Hong Kong's security, forcibly leased the area north of the original Kowloon District to the Shenzhen River, from the east of Dapeng Bay to the west of Shenzhen Bay, covering an area of over 900 square kilometers, for a period of 99 years. This area later became known as the "New Territories." By this time, the entire area of over 1,000 square kilometers, including Hong Kong Island, the entire Kowloon Peninsula south of the Shenzhen River, and the surrounding islands, had all been occupied by British imperialism. What is generally referred to as Hong Kong today includes both Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula.

After occupying Hong Kong and Kowloon, British imperialism turned it into an important base for invading China and the entire Southeast Asia, and ruthlessly plundered the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. It used Hong Kong to smuggle large quantities of opium, poisoning the Chinese people, plundering China's wealth, and even turning Hong Kong into a center for trafficking Chinese labor to the Americas. In just 1851, it trafficked a large number of Chinese laborers to the United States from Hong Kong, exchanging the lives of countless Chinese laborers for $1.5 million. By the end of the 19th century, Hong Kong, which was originally a barren island with only 2,000 fishermen, had been "developed" into an important port in Southeast Asia with a population of hundreds of thousands, based on the blood and sweat of Chinese laborers. British imperialism plundered incalculable wealth from China through Hong Kong each year, to the extent that there was a saying in Britain at the time: Hong Kong was a "shining" jewel on the "crown" of Britain, "If Hong Kong is lost, London will go bankrupt." Since the 20th century, Hong Kong has remained an important stronghold for British imperialism to invade the Southeast Asia region.

After occupying Hong Kong, British imperialism gradually established a fascist ruling system there, and used the most decadent and corrupt Western culture to cruelly oppress and corrupt our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Due to the brutal plunder and exploitation of British imperialism, our compatriots in Hong Kong have fallen into poverty. According to statistics from 1962, Hong Kong had about 300,000 unemployed people, 400,000 school dropouts, and approximately 500,000 impoverished residents living in shabby wooden houses that could not shelter from wind and rain. The contrast between the wooden house areas where the poor live and the high-rise buildings where compradors and capitalists reside is extremely stark. Hong Kong is a living example of British imperialism's blood-sucking and sinister colonial rule.

After the liberation of the mainland, British imperialism has always colluded with American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, tolerating and shielding them from using Hong Kong as an outpost base to harass and sabotage activities against the mainland of China.

For over a hundred years, British imperialism's crimes in Hong Kong are innumerable. The Chinese people, including the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, cannot tolerate British imperialism's rampant behavior. The four million compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million people on the mainland will surely thoroughly smash British imperialism's sinister rule in Hong Kong.

    英帝国主义是怎样侵占我香港、九龙和“新界”的
    腐朽的、野蛮的英帝国主义霸占我国领土香港，已有一百多年的历史。
    早在十七世纪三十年代，英帝国主义就开始对中国进行经济渗透，这一世纪的八十年代，英国在广州正式设立商馆，以后并屡次向清朝封建政府要求增辟商港和割让海岛，对中国进行侵略活动。十九世纪三十年代以后，英帝国主义丧心病狂地向中国大量输入鸦片。一八四○年，英帝国主义发动了大规模侵略中国的战争——“鸦片战争”。英国侵略军进犯广东。由于广州人民和广州驻军进行了英勇的抵抗，英军不能得逞，即北上侵犯天津。腐朽的清朝封建政府决定在英帝国主义的武力下屈膝投降，并全部撤退了广州的军队守备。一八四一年，英国侵略军又大举进攻南京，清朝政府屈辱求和，被迫在一八四二年签订了卖国的“南京条约”，规定将香港岛割让给英国。
    一八五六年，英国发动了第二次鸦片战争。它纠集法国组成英法联军，攻陷广州，并进犯北京。清政府又被迫于一八六○年同英国签订了“北京条约”，规定将香港对岸的“九龙司”地方（目前九龙半岛界限街以南的地方）割让给予英国。
    一八九八年，英帝国主义趁清朝政府在中日战争中遭到失败，又借口法国租借广州湾危及香港的安全，得寸进尺地强行租借原九龙司以北至深圳河，东起大鹏湾，西至深湾，面积达九百多平方公里的大片地区，租期为九十九年。这一块地区后来被称为“新界”。至此，香港本岛加上深圳河以南的整个九龙半岛以及附近岛屿大于一千平方公里的地区，全部为英帝国主义所侵占。现在一般所称的香港，即包括香港本岛和九龙半岛在内。
    英帝国主义在侵占香港、九龙以后，把它变为对中国以至对整个东南亚进行侵略的重要基地，并且对香港中国同胞敲骨吸髓地进行掠夺。它利用香港大量贩卖鸦片毒害中国人民，榨取中国的财富，甚至把香港变成了贩卖中国劳工去美洲的中心。仅一八五一年它就从香港贩卖大批中国劳工去美国，用无数中国劳动人民的生命换来一百五十万美元的财富。到十九世纪末叶，香港这个原来只有二千渔民的荒岛，已在中国劳动人民的血汗和尸体的基础上“建设”成为拥有几十万人口的东南亚重要商港。英帝国主义通过香港每年从中国掠夺走难以数计的财富，以至当时在英国流行一种说法：香港是所谓英国“王冠”上一颗最“辉煌”的珍珠，“香港一旦丧失，伦敦必定破产”。二十世纪以来，香港仍然是英帝国主义对东南亚地区进行侵略的一个重要据点。
    英帝国主义侵占香港后，就在那里逐步建立起了一套法西斯的统治机构，并且用最腐朽、最堕落的西方文化，来残酷压迫和腐蚀我港九同胞。由于英帝国主义的残酷掠夺和剥削，使我广大香港同胞陷于贫困的境地，据一九六二年的统计，香港失业人口有三十万人左右，失学儿童有四十万，居住在不能遮蔽风雨的简陋木屋里的贫苦居民约有五十多万。贫民住的木屋区同买办、资本家居住的高楼大厦，形成极其鲜明的贫富对比。香港，是英帝国主义吸血的、罪恶的殖民统治的一个活标本。
    全国大陆解放以后，英帝国主义一直勾结美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，纵容和包庇他们把香港作为对中国大陆进行骚扰、破坏活动的一个前哨基地。
    一百多年来，英帝国主义在香港的罪行罄竹难书。包括香港爱国同胞在内的中国人民，决不能容忍英帝国主义在香港横行霸道。四百万香港同胞和七亿中国人民一定要彻底粉碎英帝国主义在香港的罪恶统治。
