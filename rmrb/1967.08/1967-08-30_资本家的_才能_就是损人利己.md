Title: The "Talent" of Capitalists is Harming Others for Personal Gain

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously praises capitalists as being "shrewd and efficient," "technically proficient," and claims that "their managerial abilities surpass those of us Communist Party members." He even shamelessly tells capitalists:

"In terms of production and construction, we are truly not as good as you. In these areas, we are still amateurs, but you are experts. In these areas, capitalists should be placed in the forefront."

This is utterly absurd and a pack of lies!

Do capitalists really have "talent" and "technical skills"? We workers have long experienced it. Their "talent" and "technical skills" are essentially a set of tricks to harm others for personal gain, to seek fame and profit, to deceive and cheat. If we allow their "talent" and "technical skills" to develop, our country will change color and will head down the path of capitalist restoration.

Our Shanghai Luyin Qicai Factory has a unique characteristic: it has many capitalists. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai particularly favor them, believing that these capitalists are "authorities" with "talent" and "technical skills." They have given them titles such as "technical experts," "engineers," and "specialists." They have long monopolized the factory's production and technical powers, deceiving the state and the people, and sabotaging socialist construction, causing serious losses to the country. For example, there is a reactionary capitalist who boasts of having designed more than twenty types of "products," but in reality, not a single one was successful. Instead, they squandered a large amount of state wealth. Another example is that he, along with another reactionary capitalist in our factory, used the pretext of "innovating" products to actually sabotage state property. They tampered with the circuit of the Type 810 tape recorder, destroying the stability of this product's quality, causing a loss of 60 million yuan in state property. Even more despicable are some capitalists who, to show off their "talent" and "technical skills," deliberately create defects in products and then fix them to deceive leaders and the masses. This is far from what the Chinese Khrushchev says about capitalists having "managerial abilities that surpass those of Communist Party members." Capitalists arrogantly say: "We can merge our property, but we cannot merge our technology." This reveals their reactionary nature of hating and sabotaging the socialist cause.

The Chinese Khrushchev's fawning praise of capitalists ultimately reflects his class nature of being close to capitalists and hating the working class, reflecting his ambition to rely on capitalists to build, to let capitalists rule, and to restore capitalism in China. His obsequious and flattering demeanor in front of capitalists is truly nauseating. But this also helps us see the ugly face of this traitor.

Now, we see more clearly that every fallacy and every reactionary measure put forward by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are in the service of his plot to restore capitalism. We warn the Chinese Khrushchev that with us, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, your dream of restoring capitalism will never come true!

    资本家的“才能”就是损人利己

    中国的赫鲁晓夫极力吹捧资本家“精明干练”，“懂技术”，“他的管理能力超过了我们共产党员”。他还无耻地对资本家说：
  “就生产上讲，就建设上讲，这方面我们实在不如你们，关于这些方面我们还是外行，这方面你们是好的，资本家应该摆在前面。”真是混账透顶，一派胡言！
    资本家真的有“才能”和“技术”吗？我们工人早就领教过了。他们的“才能”和“技术”，说穿了，就是损人利己、损公利私的一套本事，就是唯名是求、唯利是图、弄虚作假、投机取巧的那一套货色。如果让他们的那种“才能”和“技术”发展下去，我们的国家就会改变颜色，就会走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    我们上海录音器材厂，有个特点，就是资本家多。中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人，特别器重他们，认为这些资本家都是有“才能”有“技术”的“权威”，都给他们冠以“工艺师”、“工程师”、“专家”等等头衔。他们窃踞了厂里生产技术大权，长期以来，弄虚作假，欺骗国家，欺骗人民，破坏社会主义建设，给国家造成了严重的损失。比如，有个反动资本家，吹嘘他先后设计了二十多种“产品”，事实上没有一种是成功的，相反倒糟蹋了大量的国家财富。又如，他同我厂另一个反动资本家，借“革新”产品为名，行破坏国家财产之实。他们在定型产品八一○录音机的电路上动了一次“手术”，结果破坏了这个产品质量的稳定性，损失国家财产达六千万元。更恶劣的是有些资本家，为了显示自己的“才能”和“技术”，竟然在产品上制造毛病，然后再把它修好，以此来骗取领导和群众的信任。哪里象中国赫鲁晓夫说的资本家“管理能力超过了我们共产党员”。资本家还狂妄地说：“合营了我们的财产，可合营不了我们的技术”。一语道破了他们仇视和破坏社会主义事业的反动本质。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫肉麻地吹捧资本家，归根到底，反映了他对资本家亲、对工人阶级恨的阶级本性，反映了他依靠资本家搞建设，让资本家专我们的政，在中国复辟资本主义的狼子野心。他在资本家面前的那种卑躬屈膝、阿谀奉迎的样子，实在叫人作呕。但这也可以帮助我们看清这个大叛徒的丑恶嘴脸。
    现在，我们看得更清了，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人所放出来的每一个谬论，所采取的每一个反动措施，都是为他的复辟资本主义的阴谋服务的。我们要警告中国的赫鲁晓夫，有我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派在，你的复辟资本主义的美梦永远不会得逞！
