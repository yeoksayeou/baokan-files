The Communist Party of China Beijing Garrison Command has made a decision to turn Lin Biao's inscription into a great motivation to resolutely complete the "three supports, two militaries" honorable mission.

Lin Biao's latest directive fully expresses the strong wishes of the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the entire army. It has extremely important and far-reaching significance for making the army more proletarian and more combat-ready. It will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the army and the nation.

New China News Agency, August 10th: The Communist Party of China Beijing Garrison Command today made a decision on resolutely implementing Vice Chairman Lin Biao's directive: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The full text is as follows:

Just as the world enters the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved great victories, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, our deputy commander Lin Biao, on August 9th, inscribed for our garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is a great joyous event in the political life of our garrison. It is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for our garrison. We must turn Vice Chairman Lin Biao's inscription into a great motivation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better, defend Chairman Mao with our lives, defend Vice Chairman Lin Biao with our lives, defend the Party Central Committee with our lives, defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our lives, resolutely complete the glorious mission of the "three supports, two militaries" and defending the capital assigned by our great leader Chairman Mao, and strive to make our garrison a crimson school of Mao Zedong Thought!

Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest directive is, in the unprecedented situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a timely, correct, and wise battle call issued to the army. It points the way and sets higher requirements for how to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, how to make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and how to elevate the struggle to eliminate private interests and reform worldviews to a new level. It adds a powerful driving force. Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest directive fully expresses the strong wishes of the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the entire army. It has extremely important and far-reaching significance for making the army more proletarian and more combat-ready. It will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the army and the nation. We must enthusiastically respond to, seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest directive without any wavering.

To achieve new victories, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, have boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must focus on studying and mastering Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the great classroom of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the great storms of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, we must study and apply them actively. We must follow Chairman Mao, follow Vice Chairman Lin Biao, follow the Party Central Committee, follow the Central Military Commission, and follow the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fight the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

To achieve new victories, we must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and actively engage in the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and his teaching: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy to the end than to boast like Emperor Xiang Yu," and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating the fallen enemy. We must repeatedly and deeply criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghui, and thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism they spread and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. In the great criticism, we must thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought, letting the dazzling and boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all positions.

To achieve new victories, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and resolutely complete the glorious mission of the "three supports, two militaries." At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, we must actively support the revolutionary leftists and unite closely with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, fight together, and win together. We must raise the banner of the great criticism of the revolution, achieve the great unity and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution.

To achieve new victories, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, eliminate private interests, and establish public interests, and thoroughly reform our worldviews. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." To achieve this transformation, we must take the "Three Articles" as our motto, face the wind and rain in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gain experience, undergo new tests and tempering, adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly establish the proletarian worldview of devoting oneself to the public throughout one's life and serving the people of China and the world wholeheartedly, and become proletarian revolutionary soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and highly conscious, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To achieve new victories, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind," and always maintain a humble and prudent style. We must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, never detach ourselves from the masses in any matter, correctly treat the masses, and diligently and honestly be the students of the masses. We must correctly treat ourselves, both regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. If there are shortcomings and errors, we must quickly make public self-criticisms and resolutely correct them thoroughly. We must never stop and never be self-satisfied, and while transforming the objective world, constantly transform the subjective world.

To achieve new victories, we must deeply understand Chairman Mao's teaching on the fundamental issue of the revolution being the issue of state power and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat with our lives. The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must always maintain high revolutionary vigilance, firmly grasp the rifle and the pen, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers for eternity. Whoever opposes our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, we will resolutely overthrow them! Whoever opposes our deputy commander Vice Chairman Lin Biao, we will resolutely overthrow them! Whoever opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will resolutely overthrow them! At any time and under any circumstances, we must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, and always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

To achieve new victories, we must learn from Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms and best student of Chairman Mao. Learn from him how he has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, deeply understood Mao Zedong Thought, most actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, most skillfully applied Mao Zedong Thought creatively, and most bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought. Learn from him how he has for decades consistently, resolutely, and thoroughly executed and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought. With Vice Chairman Lin Biao as our model, we must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

All levels of party committees and branches must mobilize all soldiers and officers to deeply study and widely discuss Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest directive, formulate measures, and resolutely implement it. All units must hold grand celebration meetings for Vice Chairman Lin Biao's inscription and through various forms, conduct extensive propaganda, mobilization, study, and implementation, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and welcome the convening of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the entire army and Beijing garrison with better study results, and report to our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao.

    要立新功，就必须深刻领会毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题的教导，誓死保卫无产阶级专政。我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石。必须时刻保持高度的革命警惕性，紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，保卫社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。谁反对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，就坚决打倒谁！谁反对我们的副统帅林副主席，就坚决打倒谁！谁反对中央文革小组，就坚决打倒谁！在任何时候，任何情况下，永远念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗！
