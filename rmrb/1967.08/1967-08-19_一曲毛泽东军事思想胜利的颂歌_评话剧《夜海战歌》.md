As we enthusiastically celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Cultural Group of the People's Liberation Army's Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces stationed in Beijing jointly staged the revised play *Night Sea Battle Song*, which reflects the "August 6th Sea Battle" and the "Battle East of Chongwu." This performance has greatly educated and inspired us.

*Night Sea Battle Song* vividly depicts the intense and fierce battle scenes, passionately praising Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and once again proving the truth that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Why were we able to use small boats to defeat large warships, ultimately sinking the enemy's large warships? *Night Sea Battle Song* provides a vivid answer: it is because the soldiers responded to the call of Deputy Commander Lin Biao – to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to direct the battle with Mao Zedong Thought.

Deputy Commander Lin pointed out: "The best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest fighting force is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." In this heart-pounding sea battle, how many heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought emerged! These heroes are our comrades who live and work with us on the coastal defense front. Their fighting spirit and appearance have left an indelible impression on us. There is the platoon leader Guan Dalong, who is straightforward and deeply connected with the soldiers; the engine room soldier Ding Changbao, who, despite being seriously injured, continued to fight; the new soldier Deng Desheng, who remembers his class hatred and vows to settle scores with the enemy; the dock worker Yu Leng, who eagerly wants to board the ship and fight; the nurse Zhou Yanhua from the mobile medical team, who requests to go to the sea battle for training; and the old man Lao A Gong, the young man Xiao A Dong, and the coastal defense militia, who actively support the sea battle....

These heroes share a common characteristic: they have deep class feelings, hate the enemy deeply, and love and are loyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, they are the greatest fighting force, invincible to any enemy. The revolutionary heroism of these heroes deeply inspires us, especially the image of the political instructor Tie Zhenhai of Boat 878, which leaves a profound impression on us. Tie Zhenhai is a wise and brave political instructor. As soon as he hears about the battle, he gets excited. Despite not fully recovering from his previous injury, he finds a way to leave the hospital and returns to the coastal defense front. He is not afraid of the difficulties of having few people and old boats and requests to take on important battle tasks. Especially in the night reconnaissance of Wolf Tooth Reef, he fully demonstrates his heroic and indomitable revolutionary spirit. To defeat the enemy, he dares to enter the lion's den and fears no dangers!

Political Instructor Tie has deeply realized from his past battles: only by directing the gun with Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary soldiers who hold the gun can we be invincible in the world. Therefore, he regards promoting Mao Zedong Thought as the top priority. He not only studies diligently himself but also leads everyone to study the highest directives at any time. When the sister boats go out to attack and they are on standby, the soldiers of Boat 878 look at the night sea battle and listen to the roar of the cannons, eager to attack immediately and give the enemy a good beating. Some are so angry at the invading enemy that they ignore the strategic deployment and want to attack as soon as they see the enemy ship. This eagerness to fight is understandable, but this blind and impatient mood must be overcome. Political Instructor Tie timely and accurately grasps this active thought. He follows Chairman Mao's teaching of "turning the party's policy into the masses' actions" and organizes everyone to study Chairman Mao's writings on overcoming blind impatience. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought finally helps the soldiers establish a global perspective and prepare for more arduous battles. When the enemy fleet 34.7 squadron invades again, the soldiers are full of fighting spirit, driving the gunboats out to battle. Accompanied by the roar of the waves, they hold the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and loudly read: "Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This is the highest directive, this is the heroic oath of all the soldiers of Boat 878!

In this brilliant sea annihilation battle, we not only rely on the soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought but also on the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Soldiers and civilians are the foundation of victory." "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." In this sea battle, the people and the militia truly achieved "having people when needed, having supplies when needed, calling them and they come, coming and they can fight, fighting and they can win." It is they who, before the battle, helped with the night reconnaissance of Wolf Tooth Reef; when the boats were on standby to attack, they brought drinking water; when they were about to set sail for battle, they held up lanterns to light the way; after the battle started, they assisted the troops in capturing prisoners....

This is truly "the military and the people wielding long swords, annihilating the enemy in the night sea." The unity of the military and the people is unmatched. Who can defeat us?

"All reactionaries are paper tigers." The American and Kuomintang enemy ships are nothing but paper tigers that cannot withstand a blow. Our heroic fleet sneaked under their noses, beating them until they were disoriented, their heads and faces covered in smoke and fire, and were swallowed by the sea! That so-called "Arrow King" ship captain, who was supposedly trained by the Americans, turned out to be a real "shit-stirring stick" and finally became a prisoner of the people.

This great victory, was it achieved by using some "secret weapon"? No. We only used small boats and small cannons, but the military and the people under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, along with the small boats and small cannons they control, are the invincible greatest atomic bombs in the world!

However, the counter-revolutionary conspirators Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing went against the current. They openly opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong's military thought, picked up the broken trumpet of Khrushchev's revisionism, and vigorously promoted the nonsense of "weaponry first." They opposed highlighting proletarian politics, opposed the army studying Chairman Mao's works, and promoted military first, technology first, blabbering about how "if military training is not done well, the party and the country will perish." This is a thorough counter-revolutionary bourgeois military line! The heroes in *Night Sea Battle Song* who used small boats to defeat large warships are a merciless blow to these bourgeois gentlemen! Forty years of military history also tell us that our army has never won battles relying on military technological superiority, but relying on Mao Zedong Thought and political superiority. In the past, it was small rice and rifles, today we have hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs, and it is still the same, and it will always be the same in the future.

Currently, the American imperialists and their lackeys are expanding the war in Vietnam, attempting to crazily counterattack the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness, like the heroes in the sea battle, use Mao Zedong Thought to direct the battle, and bury all the invading enemies in the vast ocean of people's war!

    一曲毛泽东军事思想胜利的颂歌
    ——评话剧《夜海战歌》
    中国人民解放军海军某部　陆振声
    当我们热烈欢庆中国人民解放军建军四十周年的时候，陆海空三军驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士联合演出委员会，再度演出了经过改编的反映“八·六海战”和“崇武以东海战”的话剧《夜海战歌》，使我们受到很大的教育和鼓舞。
    《夜海战歌》通过紧张激烈的战斗场景，热情地歌颂了毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，再一次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力的真理。为什么我们敢于用小艇打大舰，最后吃掉了敌人的大舰？《夜海战歌》作了形象的回答：就是因为战士们响应林彪副统帅的号召——活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指挥战斗的结果。
    林副统帅指出：“最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”在这场惊心动魄的海战中，涌现了多少用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物啊！这些英雄，就是我们在海防前线朝夕相处的战友。他们的战斗风姿、音容笑貌，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。那阶级感情深厚、同战士们打成一片的“直筒子”中队长关大龙，那头负重伤仍坚持战斗的麦贤得式的轮机兵丁长宝，那牢记阶级仇、誓跟敌人清算血债的新战士邓德猛，那一心想登艇参战的码头帆缆战士于楞，还有那请求到海战中锻炼的巡回医疗队护士周燕华，还有那积极配合海上作战的老阿公、小阿东和海上民兵们……。这些英雄人物有一个共同的特点：对敌人无比仇恨，对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚。因此，他们是最大的战斗力，是任何敌人不可战胜的。英雄们的革命英雄主义精神深深地感染着我们，特别是878艇指导员铁振海的形象给我们留下了极为深刻的印象。铁振海是一位智勇双全的指导员，他一听说打仗，“瘾”就来了。他不顾前次海战负了伤还没有痊愈，想方设法提前“溜”出医院来到了海防前线；他不怕人少艇老的困难，请求担负重大的战斗任务。特别是在夜探狼牙礁一场，集中地体现了他那种英勇顽强的革命英雄气概。为了打败敌人，他龙潭虎穴也敢闯，激流险滩无所惧！
    铁指导员从历次战斗实践中深深体会到：只有用毛泽东思想来指挥枪，指挥掌握枪杆子的革命战士，我们才能无敌于天下。因此，他把突出毛泽东思想的工作当作头等任务来抓。他不仅自己努力学习，而且还随时带领大家学习最高指示。当兄弟艇出击而他们待命时，878艇的战士们遥望夜海的战火，耳听隆隆的炮声，恨不得立即出击，痛打敌舰，甚至有的被来犯的敌人气红了眼，不顾战略部署，见敌舰就想打。这种急于求战的心情，是可以理解的，然而这种盲目急躁情绪却必须克服。铁指导员及时准确地抓住了这个活思想，他遵循毛主席“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动”的教导，组织大家学习毛主席有关克服盲目急躁性的论述。毛泽东思想的光辉使战士们终于树立了全局观点，准备迎接更艰巨的战斗。当敌舰34·7编队再次窜犯时，战士们个个斗志昂扬，驾着炮艇出击迎战。他们一个个伴着海涛的咆哮声，捧着《毛主席语录》高声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这就是最高指示，这就是878艇全体战士的豪迈誓言！
    在这场漂亮的海上歼灭战中，我们不仅依靠了用毛泽东思想武装的“兵”，而且依靠用毛泽东思想武装的“民”。毛主席教导我们：“兵民是胜利之本”。“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”在这场海战中，人民群众和民兵真正做到了“要人有人，要物有物”，“召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜”。就是他们，在战斗前帮助夜探狼牙礁；在战艇待命出击时送来了食用水；在临战出航时手举灯标照亮了航道；在战斗打响后协助部队捉俘虏……。这真是“军民挥长剑，夜海把敌歼”。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌！
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎。”美蒋敌舰就是不堪一击的纸老虎。我们英雄的艇队钻到它的鼻子底下，揍得它蒙头转向，焦头烂额，被浓烟烈火卷进了海底！那个所谓经过美国培训的“箭魁号”舰长“铁棒锤”，原来是一根货真价实的“捅屎棍”，最后当了人民的俘虏。
    这次伟大的胜利，难道是我们用了什么“秘密武器”吗？没有。我们用的只是小艇小炮，然而毛泽东思想统帅下的军民以及他们所掌握的小艇小炮却是天下无敌的最大的原子弹！
    但是，反党篡军的野心家彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流却反其道而行之。他们公然反对毛主席、反对毛主席的军事思想，拣起赫鲁晓夫修正主义的破喇叭，拚命鼓吹“唯武器论”的滥调。他们反对突出无产阶级政治，反对部队学习毛主席著作，而鼓吹军事第一、技术第一，胡说什么“军事训练搞不好”，“打起仗来就要亡党亡国”。这是彻头彻尾的反革命的资产阶级军事路线！《夜海战歌》中的英雄们用小艇打大舰的战迹，就是对这些资产阶级老爷们的无情打击！四十年的建军史也告诉我们，我军从来不是靠军事技术优势打胜仗，而是靠毛泽东思想，靠政治优势打胜仗。过去用小米加步枪是这样，今天我们掌握了氢弹、原子弹仍然是这样，将来也永远是这样。
    目前，美帝及其帮凶正在越南扩大战火，妄图向中国人民和世界革命人民疯狂反扑。我们一定要响应毛主席关于抓革命促战备的号召，象海战中英雄们那样，用毛泽东思想指挥打仗，把敢于来犯的敌人统统埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海之中！（附图片）
