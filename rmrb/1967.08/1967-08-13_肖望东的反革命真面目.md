Edition: 4

Through a year of criticism and struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, people have seen that the long-term rulers of the old Ministry of Culture, the representatives of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line in the literary world—figures like Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Qi Yanming, Lin Moquan, and Xiao Wangdong—are a small group of vicious counter-revolutionary revisionists. Under the direct command of China's Khrushchev, they have employed every counter-revolutionary trick to engage in various counter-revolutionary activities. They are the most dangerous enemies of proletarian dictatorship. However, some people still do not see Xiao Wangdong clearly. They say, "Didn't Xiao Wangdong only arrive at the Ministry of Culture in May 1965? He wasn't involved in literary work before, so how did he become a representative of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line?"

Here, we want to answer this question through a large amount of facts and show how this representative of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship apparatus—Xiao Wangdong—inherited the legacy of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan. He continued to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the old Ministry of Culture and the literary world, turning the old Ministry of Culture into an important base for their capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration activities. It became a Petofi Club for them to create public opinion to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. We will also show how Xiao Wangdong struggled desperately during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Striving to resist Chairman Mao's two directives, stabilizing the literary black line

May 1965 was a very unusual time. At this moment, our great leader Chairman Mao's two brilliant directives on literary work had already been issued. In these two directives, Chairman Mao thoroughly exposed the evil plot of the counter-revolutionary revisionist leaders in the literary world, such as Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, to create public opinion for capitalist restoration. He also sharply pointed out: once the time is ripe, they will stage a counter-revolutionary coup like the Petofi Club.

At this time, the literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing had already achieved world-shaking brilliant results. It opened the prelude to the great proletarian cultural revolution, loudly sounding the battle call for the proletariat to launch a great counterattack against the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm. The long-term ruling counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line in the literary world had been breached and was on the verge of collapse!

The bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carried out a series of evil activities on the ideological and cultural front, dreaming of reversing the tide. In the Ministry of Culture, they staged a fake "rectification" to deceive the masses, suppress the leftists, shield the bad elements, and cover up the black line.

It was at this critical moment that Xiao Wangdong arrived! This cunning schemer who excels in playing both sides was chosen by the Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi counter-revolutionary clique and personally approved by China's Khrushchev to come to the old Ministry of Culture. He was to carry out a fake reorganization, replacing Xia Yan and Qi Yanming, whose counter-revolutionary revisionist faces had been exposed, and ascend to the throne of reactionary rule in the old Ministry of Culture. He was entrusted with a special mission: to stabilize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line that was on the verge of collapse, so that they could regroup and wait for an opportunity to counterattack and settle old scores!

Xiao Wangdong understood his master's instructions well. As soon as he arrived at the old Ministry of Culture, he raised the banner of the "new Ministry of Culture" and the "new Party Committee." He immediately, according to the intentions of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and the two counter-revolutionary revisionist big shots Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi, began to draft the "Outline of the Ministry of Culture Party Committee's Report on Several Issues in Current Cultural Work to the Central Committee." This "Report Outline" from the beginning exaggerated the fake "rectification" in the Ministry of Culture, saying that after the "rectification," the direction had been "corrected," and the entire cultural front had begun to show a "vibrant revolutionary situation." It even said that this was a "new atmosphere" unprecedented since the founding of the nation, trying to create the illusion that the problems raised in Chairman Mao's two directives had been solved. He attempted to use these lies to cover up the serious facts of the black line dictatorship in the literary world and the life-and-death struggle between bourgeois restoration and proletarian counter-restoration. This was a "policy platform" that waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, continuing to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. It was a counter-revolutionary manifesto that crazily resisted Chairman Mao's two directives and attempted to completely cancel the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On July 13, Xiao Wangdong proudly presented this "Report Outline" to the so-called "Five-Man Group" controlled by Peng Zhen and received praise from Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi. Comrade Kang Sheng immediately saw through their plot and opposed this "Report Outline." Xiao Wangdong paid no attention and, according to Peng Zhen's instructions, actively prepared to report to the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

On September 6, China's Khrushchev personally presided over a meeting to listen to Xiao Wangdong's report. At the meeting, he completely endorsed this counter-revolutionary revisionist "Report Outline" and praised Xiao Wangdong highly. He also gave many black directives, such as "implementing Chairman Mao's literary direction 'should not be rushed,'" "Xia Yan and Qi Yanming can go to carry out the Four Clean-ups and be deputy team leaders," etc. He fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line and desperately protected the important representatives of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, Xia Yan and Qi Yanming, not allowing them to be overthrown! China's Khrushchev also instructed Xiao Wangdong to submit this "Report Outline" to the National Bureau (Department) Directors' Conference for discussion.

As soon as the master gave the order, Xiao Wangdong wasted no time. A few days later, he grandly convened the National Bureau (Department) Directors' Conference and threw out the black card "Report Outline." At the meeting, he boasted, "Today, it can also be said that we are conveying the spirit of the Central Committee's directives." Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Zhou Yang also personally attended the meeting to speak, cheering for Xiao Wangdong's so-called "new Ministry of Culture." At this meeting, they also brazenly staged a rare counter-revolutionary restoration farce nationwide: they openly put Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, and others, who had already been exposed by the revolutionary masses, on the stage, making these already terrified running dogs of China's Khrushchev sit proudly in front of the revolutionary masses again, allowing them to continue to usurp proletarian dictatorship! This meeting was a big black meeting against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a meeting to counterattack and settle old scores against the proletariat!

Just as this big black meeting was being held, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a directive at the Central Work Conference to criticize Wu Han. Peng Zhen hated it to the core and fiercely resisted. At the National Bureau (Department) Directors' Conference, he maliciously said, "In front of truth, everyone is equal, whether you are the Chairman of the Party Central Committee or not." At the same time, he repeatedly used the "treasures" of separating academic issues from political issues, "first establish then criticize," "everyone makes mistakes," etc. He also deliberately downplayed the life-and-death struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the literary world, describing it as merely a problem of understanding, inadequate ideological preparation, and what he called "neither touching the sky nor the ground." He used these black words to openly oppose Chairman Mao's great directive to criticize Wu Han and also set the tone for the subsequent counter-revolutionary revisionist "February Outline."

Xiao Wangdong treated Peng Zhen's speech as a sacred decree, repeatedly praising it as an "important directive," arranging for "study," and emphasizing that it should be "understood word by word, digested thoroughly, one bite at a time." He also distributed Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Zhou Yang's speeches nationwide, even ordering the Political Department of the old Ministry of Culture to compile them into mnemonic rhymes, "to be recited morning and evening like the daily roll call in a squad." Originally, Zhou Enlai's speech at the film planning meeting in August, which was recorded and played, was also agreed to be copied and distributed to various places. However, Xiao Wangdong intentionally blocked it, saying, "If the local areas do not come to request it, we will not give it!"

Before the National Bureau (Department) Directors' Conference, Xiao Wangdong also convened a political work meeting in August. This meeting, under the guise of discussing "emphasizing politics," concealed the serious facts of bourgeois dictatorship in the literary world behind a lot of "beautiful words" and peddled black goods of "only establishing without criticizing." The meeting should have ended early, but Xiao Wangdong deliberately delayed the summary of the meeting to after the Bureau (Department) Directors' Conference, stuffing a large amount of Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi's black words into it. Lu Dingyi was very satisfied with this "summary," and the old Propaganda Department forwarded it nationwide.

In stark contrast to Xiao Wangdong's attitude towards China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line was his extremely vicious attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing!

In the "Report Outline" he personally drafted, in order to boast about the so-called "new atmosphere" after the fake "rectification," he originally mentioned the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," and even credited them to Zhou Yang and himself, thereby completely erasing Comrade Jiang Qing's outstanding contributions in leading the literary revolution. But even so, Peng Zhen and Xiao Wangdong still found it offensive, and in the final draft, they ruthlessly deleted it all. Xiao Wangdong also colluded with Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and a small group of capitalist-roaders in the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee to attempt to use an excuse to strangle the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women." After that, he maliciously belittled the great achievements of the literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, saying things like "we need to take more, but we can't come up with more!" and "we still haven't figured out the laws of socialist culture, now we have to start from scratch." Xiao Wangdong's deep hatred for the revolutionary model operas, which are the brilliant achievements of Comrade Jiang Qing's insistence on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, was fully exposed.

Comrade Jiang Qing clearly instructed that traditional plays should not be performed for the time being. Xiao Wangdong, however, crazily shouted, "The Ministry of Culture has too many in-laws, I only listen to one family!" "Performing traditional plays is inevitable. The Central Committee has directives (referring to the black directives of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and the likes of Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi), and the masses have public opinion (referring to the counter-revolutionary clamor of the ghosts and monsters in society against the literary revolution)." He confidently advocated for performing feudal traditional plays, claiming they had several "benefits": "The content is beneficial; the masses have the habit of appreciation; it can preserve some good national arts; it can use the past to serve the present and has a certain educational role in combining with reality; it is beneficial for performing modern plays," and so on. Didn't someone say that Xiao Wangdong hadn't done cultural work before? In fact, having a counter-revolutionary revisionist political view necessarily leads to a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary view. Xiao Wangdong was exactly like this. He had long been an active advocate of the "whole people's literature" theory, once absurdly saying that literary programs "should cater to the tastes of all kinds of people," "should cater to urban, rural, upper, lower, old, and young," and so on. Now, he was vigorously advocating that the arrangement of plays "should reflect the demands of all aspects," with the purpose of completely negating the literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, bringing back the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties who had just been driven off the stage, and letting them continue to usurp the dictatorship of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the proletariat!

Xiao Wangdong was particularly enthusiastic about films that whitewashed the big and small bosses of the bourgeois headquarters. He not only promoted films like "The Great Leap Forward in Beijing Agriculture" that praised Peng Zhen and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee as models but also circulated Peng Zhen's black words about film reviews nationwide for learning. For the poisonous films of China's Khrushchev, such as "Visiting Burma," Xiao Wangdong was eager to order the printing of a large number of copies for widespread screening at home and abroad. However, he completely ignored Comrade Jiang Qing's important directives on film work, which held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and stubbornly resisted them.

Chairman Mao taught us: "There is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Why did Xiao Wangdong love China's Khrushchev so much and hate Chairman Mao so much? Why did he love the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line so much and hate the proletarian literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing so much? It was because he was a trusted lieutenant of the bourgeois headquarters, and he and the bourgeois headquarters were dependent on each other! From the day he arrived at the old Ministry of Culture, he was loyal to China's Khrushchev and closely followed the Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. He completely inherited the revisionist legacy of Xia Yan and Qi Yanming, becoming China's Khrushchev's new agent in the literary world. All his activities during this period were in line with the bourgeois headquarters' resistance to Chairman Mao's two directives and the counter-revolutionary need to maintain the black line's rule in the literary world. Because he waved the banner of the "new Ministry of Culture" and wore the cloak of an "old revolutionary," his methods were more concealed and cunning, so he could play a role that his predecessors could not!

On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, defending the bourgeois headquarters' positions, stubbornly resisting

On November 10, 1965, under the personal guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, Comrade Yao Wenyuan published the article "On the Newly Edited Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" sounding the death knell for this small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists!

Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionary things, if you don't beat them, they won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away by itself."

China's Khrushchev and Peng Zhen and this small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists were unwilling to accept their own destruction. They struggled desperately, trying to extinguish the revolutionary fire personally ignited by Chairman Mao.

In late January 1966, just over ten days before the counter-revolutionary "February Outline" was released, they used their stolen power and falsely used the name of the "Central Committee" to hurriedly circulate Xiao Wangdong's "Report Outline," which covered up the sharp class struggle in the literary world and concealed the dictatorship of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line, to temporarily resist. Xiao Wangdong's "Report Outline" was the prelude to the infamous counter-revolutionary "February Outline"!

Facing the situation of the proletariat's great counterattack, Xiao Wangdong tried to stabilize his pack of wolves and dogs, hurriedly rushed to the old Ministry of Culture to convene an organizational work meeting, and encouraged the small group of capitalist-roaders in the literary world to boost their morale, saying, "We are all the pillars of the Party and the state, specifically the pillars of the Ministry of Culture, and we must not waver!"

Immediately, Peng Zhen and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of China's Khrushchev, quickly drafted the counter-revolutionary "February Outline" and again falsely used the name of the "Central Committee" to circulate it nationwide. This "Outline" was discussed and finalized in China's Khrushchev's home and was his manifesto. Xiao Wangdong personally went to China's Khrushchev's home to participate in the discussion. This counter-revolutionary document was soaked with Xiao Wangdong's reactionary blood!

As soon as this counter-revolutionary manifesto was issued, Xiao Wangdong immediately organized its dissemination and discussion in the literary world. Xiao Wangdong gave a long speech during the dissemination, enthusiastically praising the "great significance" of this counter-revolutionary manifesto. Under his baton, many ghosts and monsters issued a chorus of counter-revolutionary howls, trying to lead the serious political struggle that was unfolding into the dead-end of so-called "pure academic" discussion. Some shouted that they should evaluate historical figures from the perspective of Beethoven's evaluation; some shouted that they should discuss the inheritance of morality and how to inherit foreign cultural heritage. Some even used the fallacy of "first establish then criticize" to plead their case.

In March, Xiao Wangdong convened another expanded meeting of the Ministry of Culture Party Committee. This meeting, under the guise of discussing "emphasizing politics," was actually, according to the deployment of the bourgeois headquarters, an attempt to deceive the masses, stabilize the situation, and further implement the counter-revolutionary "February Outline," disrupting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this meeting, Xiao Wangdong spared no effort to praise the fake "rectification" in the Ministry of Culture, shamelessly saying that it was the "continuation of the Yan'an literary rectification under new historical conditions." He boasted about his year in power, saying it was a year of "emphasizing politics, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and implementing the Party's literary direction," a year of "great changes in the work and appearance of the entire cultural and artistic front." Following this, the capitalist-roaders in the Party within the direct units of the old Ministry of Culture and the ghosts and monsters, under the guise of "summarizing work," boasted about their "merits and achievements." At the same time, Xiao Wangdong, according to the tone of the "February Outline," advocated the so-called "firmly adopting the policy of 'letting go,'" urging various units to further "combine their own actual situation, select key academic and theoretical issues related to their work, and carry out research and discussion," continuing to lead this serious political struggle into the dead-end of so-called "pure academic" discussion!

On April 10, the "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Entrusted to Comrade Jiang Qing" was issued. This was a great document that held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism. It was a revolutionary document that was fundamentally opposed to the counter-revolutionary "February Outline." It was a severe blow to China's Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. Seeing the situation was not good, Peng Zhen, before the Central Committee officially approved it, secretly sent a copy to his accomplice Xiao Wangdong, letting Xiao Wangdong be prepared. After the "Minutes" were officially issued, Xiao Wangdong organized learning on the surface, but behind the scenes, he carried out a series of sabotage activities: he sent the author of the big poisonous weed "Drafting Soldiers," who was named in the "Minutes" for criticism, to lead the army's creation conference, acting as a spy to steal information; he closely cooperated with Peng Zhen's fake "criticism" of Deng Tuo, following the instructions of the old Propaganda Department, organizing the fake "criticism" of poisonous films; he used the organization of learning the "Minutes" as a cover to suppress the masses from exposing the old Ministry of Culture and let some capitalist-roaders in the old Ministry of Culture vigorously advocate the so-called "tradition of the 1930s," and so on. Xiao Wangdong, according to Peng Zhen's intentions, used his "Report Outline" and the "report" of the expanded Party Committee meeting as the basis, drafted a speech manuscript, and prepared to go to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to make a "report," openly opposing the "Minutes." When drafting this report, he specially instructed: "Definitely follow the spirit of the 'February Outline,'" "emphasize the achievements of the past year." After arranging for another deputy minister of the old Ministry of Culture to make this "report," Comrade Kang Sheng immediately proposed severe criticism. Xiao Wangdong, after hearing this, arrogantly said, "There is no mistake!" "If there is no fundamental mistake, it can be circulated nationwide!" How arrogant his counter-revolutionary arrogance was!

In the spring of 1966, the cultural front was on the eve of a revolutionary storm. The opposition between the two headquarters and the clear division of class lines had become very clear. The bourgeois headquarters were retreating step by step. At this critical moment, Xiao Wangdong, with one face smiling and one face frowning, nervously carried out a series of evil activities: from carefully drafting the "Report Outline" to actively participating in the "February Outline," and then convening the "March Meeting," he stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He acted as the vanguard for China's Khrushchev's bourgeois headquarters and the Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to resist and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, playing a very dirty role in the bourgeois headquarters' counter-revolutionary coup to seize the Party, the army, and the government!

Following China's Khrushchev, crazily promoting the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary world

On May 16, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the drafting of the Central Committee's "Notice." This great historical document thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary "February Outline" jointly drafted by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and Peng Zhen, repulsed their counterattack, and completely disrupted their lines. Under Chairman Mao's guidance, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched nationwide. The generals of the bourgeois headquarters fell one after another, and their reactionary rule was facing its end!

China's Khrushchev desperately struggled, proposing and promoting a bourgeois reactionary line, "standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the proletarian cultural revolution that was raging, confusing right and wrong, confusing black and white, besieging the revolutionaries, suppressing different opinions, implementing white terror, thinking they were successful, boosting the bourgeois spirit, and suppressing the proletarian spirit, how vicious!"

At this decisive moment when the two headquarters were facing off, Xiao Wangdong, with unprecedented craziness, desperately defended his master China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois dictatorship in the old Ministry of Culture. After Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi's counter-revolutionary faces were completely exposed, he again allied with the new king of the old Propaganda Department's hell, crazily promoting the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by China's Khrushchev, stubbornly resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

As soon as the Central Committee's "Notice" of May 16 was issued, Xiao Wangdong, according to the new king's black directives, carefully planned and, on June 20, threw out a "Report on the Struggle to Thoroughly and Cleanly Eliminate the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist, Anti-Mao Zedong Thought Black Line in the Ministry of Culture" (the "June 20 Report"). This was a black manifesto that, under the guise of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fully promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, opposed the Central Committee's "Notice," and suppressed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Central Committee's "Notice" told us that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main targets of the revolution are the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, the small group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, and it called on us to "hold high the banner of proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary position of those so-called 'academic authorities' who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary ideas in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing fields, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields." However, Xiao Wangdong's black manifesto directly aimed its struggle at the broad revolutionary masses. He wanted to send a strong work team to the old Ministry of Culture to suppress the revolutionary masses and carry out a thorough "cleaning." In Xiao Wangdong's words, the black gang was the rabbit, and the masses were the grass, "to catch the rabbit, first cut the grass" (actually not catching the "rabbit" but cutting the "grass"), to carry out a "fall leaf sweep" in the literary world, "sweeping layer by layer, peeling department by department, plowing three feet deep, plowing five times, sweeping out the door." At the same time, he desperately disguised himself as the "red line," disguising the old Ministry of Culture's last dynasty as the "new Ministry of Culture," and used the method of holding "training classes" to protect a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists who had been exposed by the revolutionary masses. He specially emphasized the need to take good care of Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others, saying nonsense like "taking care of the elderly is a virtue of the Chinese people," and shaking hands and greeting them like brothers; he struck a large area and protected a small group; he used all kinds of methods to try to reverse the direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Central Committee's "Notice" told us: to carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well, we must inspire the entire Party to mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian cultural warriors to continue to charge forward. Xiao Wangdong's black manifesto, however, maliciously described the entire literary team as a mess of black. He spread rumors everywhere, saying, "The Ministry of Culture is the old Shanghai's Fourth Avenue," "there are no good people above the level of section chief, and the group leaders are all turtles and toads!" He even said that the driver team, technical team, and kitchen team "were all rotten," and that relying on the people of the Ministry of Culture to carry out the cultural revolution, "it would take a hundred years to succeed." He slandered the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary world as "dogs biting people, people biting dogs, people biting people, dogs biting dogs," deliberately muddying the water and confusing the class lines.

Xiao Wangdong's "June 20 Report" was a typical black model of China's Khrushchev's promotion of the bourgeois reactionary line. As soon as it was released, the old Ministry of Culture and its direct units became the "experimental field" for the bourgeois headquarters to promote the bourgeois reactionary line, forming a white terror. On the one hand, they carried out a large-scale "cleaning of the outskirts," "digging the foundation," "pulling out the black beard," and "sweeping the black net," labeling many revolutionary cadres as "black gang's confidants," "black gang's henchmen." Some departments even listed more than 60% of the cadres as targets for "cleaning." On the other hand, they loudly carried out "checking the wind direction," "anti-interference," "clearing obstacles," and "catching fish," labeling many revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," "fake leftists, true rightists," "political pickpockets," etc. In an art academy with only seven or eight hundred people, more than a hundred were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Xiao Wangdong gritted his teeth and said, "If you have to be ruthless, you have to be ruthless, otherwise, you won't be able to beat them, they will beat you."

This black manifesto was personally written with comments by the new king, approved by China's Khrushchev, and circulated nationwide in the name of the "Central Committee," instructing various places to follow its example. Many regions and departments' capitalist-roaders in the Party followed suit, carrying out large-scale "cleaning" and setting up "training classes," creating divisions among the revolutionary masses and inciting mass against mass. Its poison spread throughout the country. Its evil influence has not been completely eliminated to this day.

Xiao Wangdong, because of his "merits" in opposing the Party, was "promoted" by the bourgeois headquarters. In late June, the new king told Xiao Wangdong, "Your position as minister is decided, now you need to go through a legal procedure, first use the word 'acting.'" Soon, Xiao Wangdong was indeed awarded the title of acting minister of the Ministry of Culture. After that, this ambitious man became even more stubborn in maintaining the counter-revolutionary stance he showed in this black manifesto. Until after the Central Work Conference, when the broad revolutionary masses began to expose and criticize this black manifesto, pursuing it relentlessly, Xiao Wangdong was still ferociously pulling out his master China's Khrushchev to threaten the masses, saying, "'The June 20 Report' was approved by the 'Central Committee,' and as long as the 'Central Committee' does not withdraw it, it remains valid."

After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the counter-revolutionary face of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party was completely exposed, and the bourgeois headquarters were about to collapse completely. At this time, China's Khrushchev's accomplice Xiao Wangdong still used the literary front he controlled to desperately struggle to save their doomed fate.

Just as our great leader Chairman Mao was reviewing the million-strong cultural revolution army for the first time, Xiao Wangdong, together with another deputy minister of the old Ministry of Culture, accepted the new king's black directives and used the opportunity to shoot a large-scale color documentary to do everything possible to highlight China's Khrushchev's scenes, creating an illusion and deceiving the masses. The Central Cultural Revolution Group saw through his plot, and Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, and Comrade Jiang Qing gave severe criticism. However, Xiao Wangdong, while paying lip service, still highlighted China's Khrushchev on the screen. Later, when shooting the films of Chairman Mao's second and third receptions of the Red Guards and revolutionary students, Xiao Wangdong again resisted the Central Cultural Revolution Group and tried hard to beautify his black master in the films. When the broad revolutionary masses strongly demanded to stop the sale of China's Khrushchev's big poisonous weed "Cultivation," Xiao Wangdong, following the new king's black directives, brazenly instructed bookstores to continue selling it. When the Central Cultural Revolution Group decided to stop the sale of China's Khrushchev's portrait, Xiao Wangdong again resisted and ignored it.

On the other hand, when the broad revolutionary masses strongly demanded the printing of the standard portraits of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao and the large-scale publication of Chairman Mao's works, Xiao Wangdong ignored them. Even the revolutionary masses of the Publishing Bureau's initiative to print large quantities of Chairman Mao's works and the standard portraits of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin was brutally suppressed by Xiao Wangdong. When the Central Cultural Revolution Group decided to perform revolutionary model operas on National Day in 1966 to publicize the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xiao Wangdong, under the pretext of "some people disagreeing," reported to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, saying, "'The White-Haired Girl' cannot be performed." He also played tricks, sabotaging the performances of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Harbor" in Beijing, desperately resisting the literary revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing. What was particularly infuriating was that Xiao Wangdong's series of evil activities all occurred after the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which fully exposed Xiao Wangdong's deep hatred for the proletarian headquarters.

After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao, in October, personally presided over the Central Work Conference. These two conferences further exposed the cover of the bourgeois headquarters and declared the complete failure of the bourgeois reactionary line. However, at this Central Work Conference, the extremely reactionary Xiao Wangdong still followed the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, crazily defending the bourgeois reactionary line they promoted and fiercely resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, shamelessly counterattacking. In his speech at the meeting, he continued to maliciously slander the broad revolutionary masses, repeatedly shouting, "The Ministry of Culture can only rely on forty or fifty people, the rest are all rotten." "The cadres in the Ministry of Culture, except for a few who were transferred from the army, are all finished." "If other units rely on the revolutionary majority, we cannot." He also fiercely said, "I think the current situation is still quite serious. The influence of Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi has not been thoroughly eliminated. If we are not careful, there may be a big counterattack." Who was Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi's number one accomplice in the Ministry of Culture? It was none other than Xiao Wangdong himself! Now, this Xiao Wangdong jumped out to shout loudly about "eliminating the influence of Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi," and this deceitful talk, when exposed, was nothing but to slander the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres who were rising up to rebel against him as the "social base of the black line," and to call their revolutionary rebellious actions a "big counterattack of the old forces," preparing to settle accounts in the autumn. This was his propaganda to prepare for more crazily suppressing the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. He even openly threatened the Central Cultural Revolution Group and opposed the Central Cultural Revolution Group's resolute support for the revolutionary rebels. At this time, in such a solemn meeting presided over by Chairman Mao, Xiao Wangdong dared to be so crazy in attacking Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the proletarian headquarters, truly reaching the extreme of audacity! Xiao Wangdong was a thorough counter-revolutionary diehard!

After the Central Work Conference, the new king and Xiao Wangdong became even closer, relying on each other. He privately told Xiao Wangdong, "Old Xiao, if we fall, we fall together!" and personally spread rumors to deceive the revolutionary masses, saying, "Xiao Wangdong was sent by Chairman Mao, you can press him a bit, but don't press him flat!" Xiao Wangdong, after hearing this, was very pleased, saying, "With this sentence, it's enough!" It was under the protection and support of the new king that Xiao Wangdong's counter-revolutionary arrogance remained very high. After the Central Work Conference, he spread a large number of rumors, viciously attacking the Central Cultural Revolution Group; he spread a counter-revolutionary economic wind, deceiving and luring a large number of literary and art workers from other places to Beijing to put pressure on the Central Committee (spending over five million yuan in two to three months); he manipulated the old Ministry of Culture's Political Department, Evil Wave Combat Team, and other tools to shift the direction of the struggle, continuing to incite mass against mass; he carried out evil underground activities, plotting a fake seizure of power, collecting black materials to suppress the revolutionary rebels. He threateningly warned the revolutionary rebels, "Don't just look at your smiling face, you also have to see who smiles last!"

Overthrow Xiao Wangdong, carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary world to the end

Marx said, people are the authors of their own drama, and at the same time, they are the actors of this drama. Xiao Wangdong's self-performance in the old Ministry of Culture can be said to be perfect!

Xiao Wangdong was originally an old counter-revolutionary revisionist, a long-time opponent of Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters. He had repeatedly viciously attacked our most red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, saying, "Old plays cannot be performed, you see, when the emperor comes out in ancient plays, he is so majestic. If the Chairman is sitting below, he would think, in the past, wasn't I the emperor, also so majestic; if the marshal sees it, he would think it is like being a prime minister." He also incited people not to "only see Tiananmen above, but not see Tiananmen below." In his office, he did not hang Chairman Mao's portrait and quotations but hung the so-called "four points" of the counter-revolutionary conspirator Luo Ronghuan. He also openly opposed Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's directives on emphasizing politics, shouting, "It is not military that impacts politics, nor is it politics that impacts military, but it impacts the soldiers' rest." After coming to the old Ministry of Culture, he repeatedly emphasized the need to highlight China's Khrushchev, saying, "You have to pay attention, there are two chairmen!" and blatantly attacked the masses learning the "Three Old Articles" as "chanting the name of Amitabha." At the decisive moment when the two headquarters were fighting to the death, the bourgeois headquarters chose him to replace Xia Yan and Qi Yanming, acting as the last tyrant of the old Ministry of Culture's counter-revolutionary dynasty, making him overjoyed and more fully and crazily displaying his counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, serving the bourgeois headquarters' counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Xiao Wangdong and Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Moquan, and Qi Yanming were completely of the same ilk. In the seventeen years of black line rule in the literary world, he occupied a special and very important position. He was an important representative of this counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, and he committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

Xiao Wangdong, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, so crazily and unremittingly promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, with the purpose of protecting the bourgeois headquarters he depended on, protecting the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line including himself, and protecting the bourgeois dictatorship in the old Ministry of Culture including himself. What "seventeen years" and "fifty days" meant to Xiao Wangdong were completely two in one, inseparable. Without thoroughly overthrowing Xiao Wangdong, without criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line he promoted, it would be impossible to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line that ruled the literary world for seventeen years; and without recognizing what the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line of seventeen years was, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "fifty days" would also be empty talk. In short, without properly combining these two, it would be impossible to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary world to the end!

Ironclad facts show: Xiao Wangdong is a trusted lieutenant of China's Khrushchev, a faithful executor of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, and the chief culprit of suppressing the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary world. He is an extremely vicious counter-revolutionary revisionist!

Now, Xiao Wangdong, this "new sediment" that stirred up a time, has "sunk" down and been submerged in the vast ocean of revolutionary masses who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is a great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

"Exploit the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy," we proletarian revolutionaries must further unite, carry forward the spirit of "beating the fallen dog," pursue victory, and thoroughly criticize and overthrow Xiao Wangdong! Bury Xiao Wangdong, along with the entire counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and the bourgeois dictatorship of the old Ministry of Culture, thoroughly!

    肖望东的反革命真面目
    旧文化部　机关革命战斗组织联络站
    经过一年来无产阶级文化大革命的批判斗争，人们看到了，长期统治旧文化部，在文艺界实行资产阶级专政的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的代表人物陆定一、周扬、夏衍、齐燕铭、林默涵、肖望东之流，是一小撮穷凶极恶的反革命修正主义分子。他们在中国的赫鲁晓夫直接指挥下，集一切反革命权术之大成，疯狂地阴险地从事各种反革命活动，他们是无产阶级专政最危险的敌人。但是，对肖望东这条毒蛇，有些人还看得不那么清楚。他们说：“肖望东不是一九六五年五月才到文化部的吗？以前他不是搞文艺工作的，怎么也成了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的代表人物了呢？”
    这里我们想通过大量事实来回答这一问题，并且来看看这个混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物——肖望东，是怎样承袭反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬、夏衍的衣钵，继续在旧文化部，在文艺界实行资产阶级专政，使旧文化部成为他们从事资本主义反革命复辟活动的重要基地，成为他们为颠覆无产阶级专政制造舆论的裴多菲俱乐部，以及肖望东是怎样在无产阶级文化大革命中进行垂死挣扎的。
    竭力抗拒毛主席的两次批示，为文艺黑线稳住阵脚
    一九六五年五月，这是一个很不寻常的时刻：
    这时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席关于文艺工作的两次光辉批示，已经先后下达。毛主席在这两个批示中，彻底揭露了陆定一、周扬等文艺界反革命修正主义头头为资本主义复辟大造舆论的罪恶阴谋，并且尖锐地指出：一旦时机成熟，他们就要演出裴多菲俱乐部那样的反革命政变。
    这时候，江青同志亲自领导的文艺革命，已经取得了震撼世界的辉煌成就，它揭开了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的序幕，响亮地吹起了无产阶级在意识形态领域内向资产阶级大反击的战斗号角！长时期统治着文艺界的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，已经被打开一个大缺口，摇摇欲坠了！
    以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，顽固地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在思想文化阵地上进行了一系列罪恶活动，梦想挽狂澜于既倒。他们在文化部，一手导演了一场欺骗群众、压制左派、包庇坏人、掩护黑线的假“整风”。
    正是在这个时候，肖望东来了！这个善于耍弄反革命两面手法的野心家，被彭真、陆定一反革命集团选中，经中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自圈定，来到旧文化部，实行假改组，代替反革命修正主义面目已经暴露的夏衍、齐燕铭，登上了旧文化部反动统治的宝座。他是担负着这样一项特殊使命来到旧文化部的，那就是：为面临全线崩溃的反革命修正主义文艺黑线稳住阵脚，以便重整旗鼓，伺机反扑，反攻倒算！
    肖望东对他主子的托付心领神会。他一到旧文化部，就打起了“新文化部”、“新党委”的旗号，并且立刻按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和彭真、陆定一这两个反革命修正主义大头目的旨意，着手炮制《文化部党委关于当前文化工作中若干问题向中央的汇报提纲》。这个《汇报提纲》，一开始就大肆吹嘘文化部的假“整风”，说什么经过“整风”已经“端正了方向”，“整个文化战线开始出现了蓬勃的革命形势”，甚至说“这是开国以来从未有过的新气象”，极力制造一种假象：似乎毛主席两次批示中提出的问题已经解决了。他妄图用这些谎言来掩盖文艺界黑线专政的严重事实，掩盖文艺战线上资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的斗争。这是一个打着“红旗”反红旗、继续推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线的“施政纲领”，是一个疯狂抵制毛主席两次批示、妄图根本取消无产阶级文化大革命的反革命宣言书。
    七月十三日，肖望东得意洋洋地捧着这个《汇报提纲》，向彭真一手把持的所谓“五人小组”作了汇报，备受彭真、陆定一等人的赞赏。康生同志当场识破了他们的阴谋，反对这个《汇报提纲》。肖望东根本不理，坚决按照彭真的旨意，积极准备向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派汇报。
    九月六日，中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，主持会议，听取肖望东的汇报。在会上，他完全肯定了这个反革命修正主义的《汇报提纲》，对肖望东慰勉有加，并且作了许多黑指示，什么贯彻毛主席的文艺方向“不能搞急了”，什么“夏衍、齐燕铭可以去搞四清，当副队长”，等等，拚命反对毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，竭力保护反革命修正主义文艺黑线的重要代表人物夏衍、齐燕铭，不准打倒！中国的赫鲁晓夫还指示肖望东，把这个《汇报提纲》提交全国文化局（厅）长会议讨论。
    主子一声令下，肖望东马不停蹄，没隔几天，就大张旗鼓地召开全国文化局（厅）长会议，抛出了黑王牌《汇报提纲》。他在会上得意忘形地说：“今天也可以说是传达中央指示的精神”。彭真、陆定一、周扬也都亲自出马，到会讲话，为肖望东的所谓“新文化部”擂鼓助威。在这个会上，他们还明火执仗地演了一出全国罕见的反革命复辟的丑剧：公然把已经被革命群众揪出来的夏衍、阳翰笙等捧上主席台，叫这伙已经丧魂失魄的中国赫鲁晓夫的“乏”走狗又重新趾高气扬地坐在革命群众面前，让他们继续专无产阶级的政！这个会是一个反对毛主席的革命路线、向无产阶级反攻倒算的大黑会！
    就在这个大黑会召开的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中央工作会议上，作出了必须批判吴晗的指示。彭真恨之入骨，拚命抵抗。他在全国文化局（厅）长会议上恶毒地说：“在真理面前，是人人平等的，管你是党中央的主席也好”；同时，他接二连三地祭起学术问题要同政治问题分开、先“立”后破、“错误人人有份”等等“法宝”；并且别有用心地把文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路的生死斗争，轻描淡写地说成只是什么认识问题、思想准备不足问题和什么“上不着天、下不着地”的问题。他用这些黑话，明目张胆地反对毛主席关于批判吴晗的伟大指示，同时，也为以后出笼的反革命修正主义《二月提纲》定下了基调。
    肖望东把彭真的这个讲话奉若神明，一再吹嘘它是“重要的指示”，布置“学习”，强调“要逐字逐句领会，要吃透，一口一口地吃。”他还把彭真、陆定一、周扬的讲话，印发全国，甚至要旧文化部政治部把彭真、陆定一、周扬的黑话，编成口诀，“要象连队每天点名时喊口号一样，早晚背诵”。本来，在这个会上还听了周总理八月间在电影规划会议上高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、阐述毛主席革命文艺路线的讲话录音，周总理也同意把这个讲话录音复制后发给各地，但肖望东却有意封锁，说什么“如果各地不来要，就不给！”
    在全国文化局（厅）长会议之前，肖望东还在八月间召开了一次政治工作会议。这个会议，以讨论“突出政治”为名，在大量“漂亮话”的背后，掩盖文艺界资产阶级专政的严重事实，贩卖光“立”不破的黑货。本来会议早就可以结束，可是，肖望东却硬把会议的总结拖到文化局（厅）长会议之后，把彭真、陆定一的黑话大量塞了进去。陆定一对这个“总结”极为满意，由旧中宣部把它批转全国。
    同肖望东对中国的赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义黑线的态度形成强烈对照的，是他对毛主席的革命路线、对江青同志领导的文艺革命所采取的极端恶劣的态度！
    在他一手炮制的《汇报提纲》中，为了吹嘘假“整风”以后的所谓“新气象”，原来还提了一句革命现代京剧《红灯记》和革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，并把它们记在周扬和他自己的“功劳簿”上，从而根本抹杀江青同志领导文艺革命的卓越贡献。但就是这样，彭真和肖望东仍觉得刺眼，在最后定稿时，恶狠狠地全部勾掉了。肖望东还和彭真、陆定一以及广东省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派勾结在一起，妄图借故扼杀革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。这以后，他又恶毒地贬低江青同志领导的文艺革命的伟大成果，说什么“要多拿两个，又拿不出来！”说什么“社会主义文化的规律，我们还没有摸清楚，现在要从头做起。”肖望东对江青同志坚持毛主席革命文艺路线取得的辉煌成果——革命样板戏的刻骨仇恨充分暴露出来了。
    江青同志明确指示，现在不要开放传统戏。肖望东却疯狂叫嚷：“文化部的公婆太多，我只听一家的！”“上演传统戏，势在必行。中央有指示（按：指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和彭真、陆定一之流的黑指示），群众有舆论（按：指社会上牛鬼蛇神反对文艺革命的反革命叫嚣）。”他振振有词地鼓吹上演封建传统戏有所谓几大“好处”：“内容有益；群众有欣赏习惯；能够保存某些好的民族艺术；可以古为今用，对现实有一定的配合教育作用；对演现代戏有好处”等等。不是有人说肖望东以前没搞文化工作吗？其实，有反革命修正主义的政治观，就必然有反革命修正主义的文艺观。肖望东正是这样。他早就是“全民文艺”论的积极鼓吹者，曾胡说什么文艺节目“要适合各种人的口味”，“要适应城市、农村、上层、下层、老年、青年”，等等。现在，他又极力宣称，剧目安排“要反映各方面的要求”，其目的就是要根本否定江青同志领导的文艺革命，把刚被赶下舞台的帝王将相、才子佳人重新召上舞台，让他们继续专工农兵的政，专无产阶级的政！
    肖望东对为资产阶级司令部大小头目涂脂抹粉的影片，更是十分热心。他不仅把为彭真和旧北京市委歌功颂德的《北京农业大跃进》等一批坏影片捧成“样板”，而且把彭真审查影片的一些黑话，也通报全国制片厂学习。对中国的赫鲁晓夫《访问缅甸》等毒草影片，肖望东更是迫不及待地下令洗印大量拷贝，在国内外广泛放映，而对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江青同志关于电影工作的重要指示，则一概不理，顽固抗拒。
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”肖望东为什么对中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部这样爱，对毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这样恨？为什么对反革命修正主义文艺黑线这样爱，对江青同志领导的无产阶级文艺革命这样恨？就因为他是资产阶级司令部的得力干将，他和资产阶级司令部是相依为命的！从他到旧文化部的第一天起，就死心塌地效忠于中国的赫鲁晓夫，紧紧追随彭真、陆定一反革命修正主义集团，全盘接过夏衍、齐燕铭的修正主义衣钵，成为中国的赫鲁晓夫安插在文艺界的新的代理人。他在这个时期的全部活动，都是适应着资产阶级司令部抗拒毛主席的两次批示，妄图在文艺界维持黑线统治的反革命需要的。由于他打着“新文化部”的旗号，披着“老革命”的外衣，手法更加隐蔽、狡猾，所以他就能起他的前任所不能起的作用！
    在文化大革命前夜，为资产阶级司令部死守阵地，负隅顽抗
    一九六五年十一月十日，在江青同志的亲自指导下，姚文元同志发表了《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章，敲响了这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的丧钟！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭真等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，不甘心于自己的灭亡。他们垂死挣扎，妄图把毛主席亲自点燃的这场革命烈火扑灭下去。
    一九六六年一月下旬，也就是反革命《二月提纲》出笼前十多天，他们利用窃取的权力，盗用“中央”名义，匆匆忙忙地把肖望东那个抹杀文艺界尖锐激烈的阶级斗争、掩盖反革命修正主义黑线专政的《汇报提纲》，批转全国，用来先抵挡一阵。肖望东的这个《汇报提纲》是臭名昭著的反革命《二月提纲》的前奏曲！
    面对无产阶级大反击的形势，肖望东力图稳住他的狐群狗党，急急忙忙地赶到旧文化部召开的组织工作会议上，为文艺界党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打气壮胆，说：“我们都是党和国家的栋梁，具体说是文化部的栋梁，千万不能动摇”！
    紧接着，彭真等反革命修正主义分子在中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持下，立刻炮制了反革命的《二月提纲》，并再度盗用“中央”名义，批转全国。这个《提纲》就是在中国的赫鲁晓夫家里讨论定稿的，也就是他的纲领。肖望东亲自到中国的赫鲁晓夫家里参加讨论。在这个反革命文件中，渗进了肖望东的反动心血！
    这个反革命纲领一下达，肖望东立刻在文艺界积极地组织传达和讨论。肖望东在传达时，作了长篇讲话，极力吹捧这个反革命纲领的“重大意义”。在他的指挥棒下，许多牛鬼蛇神发出一片反革命叫嚣，极力把一场正在展开的严重的政治斗争，引向所谓“纯学术”讨论的歧途。他们有的叫嚷：要从历史人物评价，联系到贝多芬如何评价；要从道德继承问题，联系到对外国的文化遗产怎么继承等问题。有的叫嚷：要对一百四十多个历史人物，组织力量分批进行研究。有的还借“先立后破”的谬论，为自己鸣冤叫屈。
    三月间，肖望东又召开了一次文化部党委扩大会议。这个会议，挂羊头，卖狗肉，名义上是讨论“突出政治”，实质上是根据资产阶级司令部的部署，妄图欺骗群众，稳住阵脚，进一步贯彻反革命《二月提纲》，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在这次会上，肖望东不遗余力地吹捧文化部的假“整风”，无耻地说这是“延安文艺整风在新的历史条件下的继续”。他大肆吹嘘自己上台后的一年，是什么“突出政治，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，贯彻党的文艺方向的一年”，是什么“整个文化艺术战线的工作和面貌大转变的一年”。接着，旧文化部直属单位的党内走资本主义道路当权派和牛鬼蛇神，就借“总结工作”之名，大张旗鼓地为自己“评功摆好”。同时，肖望东又按照《二月提纲》的调门，鼓吹所谓“坚决采取‘放’的方针”，要各单位进一步“结合本身实际情况，有重点地选择同自己工作密切有关的学术、理论问题，展开研究和讨论”，继续把这场严重的政治斗争引入所谓“纯学术”讨论的死胡同！
    四月十日，《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》下达。这是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、高举革命批判旗帜的伟大文件。这是和反革命《二月提纲》根本对立的革命文件。这是给中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团的一个极其沉重的打击。彭真见势不妙，在中央正式批准之前，就私下送了一份给他的死党肖望东，让肖望东有所准备。《纪要》正式下达后，肖望东表面上也组织学习，但在背后，又搞了一系列的破坏活动：他派出《纪要》点名批判的大毒草《抓壮丁》的作者带队参加全军创作会议，充当坐探，窃取情报；他紧密配合彭真对邓拓的假“批判”，秉承旧中宣部的旨意，组织对毒草影片的假“批判”；他借组织学习《纪要》为名，压制群众起来对旧文化部进行揭发，并让一些旧文化部的走资本主义道路当权派大肆鼓吹所谓“三十年代传统”，等等。肖望东还按照彭真的意图，以自己的《汇报提纲》和党委扩大会议“报告”为基础，炮制一个讲话稿，准备到人大常委会去作“报告”，公开同《纪要》唱对台戏。在起草这个报告时，他特别交代：“一定要贯彻《二月提纲》精神”，“着重谈一年来的成绩”。在他安排另一个旧文化部的副部长作了这个“报告”后，康生同志立刻提出严厉的批评。肖望东知道后却极端狂妄地说：“没有错！”“如无原则错误，可以印发全国各地！”他的反革命气焰嚣张到了何等地步！
    一九六六年的春天，文化战线正处在一场革命的狂风暴雨的前夜。两个司令部的对立，阶级阵线的分野，已经十分明朗。资产阶级司令部正在节节溃败。在这样一个关键时刻，肖望东阳一套、阴一套，紧张地进行了一系列罪恶的活动：从精心炮制《汇报提纲》，到积极参与《二月提纲》，再到召开“三月会议”，一直顽固地同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，为中国的赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级司令部，以及这个司令部所庇护的彭真、陆定一反革命修正主义集团反抗和破坏无产阶级文化大革命充当急先锋，在资产阶级司令部阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的反革命复辟活动中，扮演了一个极其肮脏的角色！
    死跟中国的赫鲁晓夫，疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，镇压文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命
    一九六六年五月十六日，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持制订了中共中央的《通知》。这个伟大的历史文件，彻底粉碎了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派伙同彭真炮制的反革命《二月提纲》，击退了他们的反扑，完全打乱了他们的阵线。在毛主席的指引下，一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。资产阶级司令部的干将一个一个相继倒台，他们的反动统治已经面临末日！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫疯狂地进行垂死的挣扎，提出并推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！”
    在两个司令部白刃相接的这个决战时刻，肖望东以百倍的疯狂，拚命死保他的主子中国的赫鲁晓夫，死保旧文化部的资产阶级专政。他在彭真、陆定一等的反革命面目被彻底揭露以后，又同反革命两面派、旧中宣部阎王殿的新阎王结成死党，疯狂推行中国的赫鲁晓夫提出的资产阶级反动路线，顽固地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    中共中央五月十六日《通知》一下达，肖望东立刻根据新阎王的黑指示，精心策划，在六月二十日，抛出了一个《文化部为彻底、干净搞掉反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线而斗争的报告》（即“六·二○报告”）。这是一个以贯彻毛主席革命路线为名，全面推行资产阶级反动路线，和中央《通知》大唱反调，镇压无产阶级文化大革命的黑纲领。
    中共中央《通知》告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并且号召我们，要“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。”但是，肖望东的这个黑纲领，却把斗争矛头直接指向广大的革命群众，他要派强大的工作队到旧文化部，镇压革命群众，大搞“犁庭扫院”。用肖望东的话来说，就是：黑帮是兔子，群众是草，“要抓兔子先割草”（其实是不抓“兔子”只割“草”），要在文艺界“来个秋风扫落叶”，“一层一层地扫，一个部门一个部门地剥”，“犁地三尺”、“深耕五遍”、“扫地出门”。同时，他拚命把自己打扮成“红线”，把以他为代表的这个旧文化部末代王朝伪装成“新文化部”，并用办“集训班”的办法，把已经被革命群众揪出来的一小撮反革命修正主义分子保护起来。他特别强调要对田汉、夏衍等多加照顾，胡说什么“照顾老年人，是中国人的美德”，和他们握手言欢，亲如兄弟；他打击一大片，保护一小撮；他用尽种种方法，妄图扭转无产阶级文化大革命的大方向。
    中共中央《通知》告诉我们：要搞好这场无产阶级文化大革命，必须鼓舞全党放手发动广大的工农兵群众和无产阶级文化战士继续冲锋前进。肖望东的黑纲领却别有用心地把整个文艺队伍描绘得一团漆黑。他到处散播什么：“文化部是解放前上海的四马路”，“处长以上没有好东西，科组长也都是些乌龟王八”！甚至说连司机班、技工班、炊事班“也全烂掉了”，“靠文化部的人搞文化大革命，一百年也搞不成”。他把文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命诬蔑为“狗咬人，人咬狗，人咬人，狗咬狗”，故意把水搅浑，混淆阶级阵线。
    肖望东的“六·二○报告”，是中国的赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线的典型黑样板。它一出笼，旧文化部及其直属单位就成为资产阶级司令部推行资产阶级反动路线的“试验田”，形成了一片白色恐怖。他们一方面大搞什么“扫外围”，“挖基础”，“拔黑须”，“扫黑网”，把许多革命干部打成“黑帮亲信”，“黑帮爪牙”，有的部门竟把百分之六十以上的干部列为“犁庭扫院”的对象；另一方面，大张旗鼓地“查风口”、“反干扰”、“扫障碍”、“抓游鱼”，把许多革命群众打成“反革命分子”、“假左派、真右派”、“政治扒手”等等，在只有七、八百人的一所艺术院校中，被打成“反革命”的竟达一百多人。肖望东咬牙切齿地说：“该狠心就要狠心，不狠心不行，你不打他，他要打你。”
    这个黑纲领，由新阎王亲自写了批语，经中国的赫鲁晓夫批准，盗用“中央”名义批转全党，要各地参照执行。不少地区和部门的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，依法炮制，大搞“犁庭扫院”，大办“集训班”，在革命群众之间制造对立，挑动群众斗群众。它的流毒，遍及全国。它的恶劣影响，至今还没有完全肃清。
    肖望东，由于反党有“功”，就被资产阶级司令部“加官进爵”。六月下旬，新阎王对肖望东说：“你这个部长定了，现在要履行一个法律手续，先用‘代理’二字”。不久，肖望东果然就被赏给了文化部代理部长的头衔。此后，肖望东这个野心家就更加顽固地坚持他在这个黑纲领中表现的反革命立场。直到中央工作会议之后，当广大革命群众纷纷起来对这个黑纲领揭发批判、穷追猛打的时候，肖望东仍然穷凶极恶地抬出他的主子中国的赫鲁晓夫来威胁群众，说：“‘六·二○报告’是经过‘中央’批准的，‘中央’没有撤销之前，仍然有效”。
    八届十一中全会后，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的反革命嘴脸彻底暴露，资产阶级司令部即将全线总崩溃。在这个时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫的死党肖望东仍然利用他所控制的文艺阵地，继续为挽救他们即将覆灭的命运进行垂死挣扎。
    就在我们伟大的领袖毛主席第一次检阅百万文化革命大军的时候，肖望东伙同旧文化部的另一个副部长，接受新阎王的黑指示，利用摄制大型彩色纪录影片的机会，千方百计突出中国的赫鲁晓夫的镜头，为他制造假象，迷惑群众。中央文革识破了他的阴谋，陈伯达同志、康生同志和江青同志对此提出了严厉的批评。但是肖望东阳奉阴违，仍然在银幕上突出中国的赫鲁晓夫。随后，在摄制毛主席第二次、第三次接见红卫兵和革命师生的影片时，肖望东又一再对抗中央文革，竭力在影片中美化他的黑主子。当广大革命群众纷纷要求停售中国的赫鲁晓夫的大毒草《修养》时，肖望东紧随新阎王的黑指示，悍然通知书店继续销售。当中央文革决定停售中国的赫鲁晓夫的画像时，肖望东又进行抵制，不予理睬。
    另一方面，当广大革命群众强烈要求印制毛主席和林彪副主席的标准画像，强烈要求大量出版毛主席著作时，肖望东却置之不理。连出版局的革命群众提出大量出版毛主席著作与印制毛主席、林副主席的标准画像的积极倡议，也受到肖望东的蛮横压制。当中央文革决定在一九六六年国庆节大演革命样板戏，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果时，肖望东却借口“有的群众不同意”，向中央文革报告说：“《沙家浜》不能上演”。他还玩弄鬼蜮伎俩，破坏《智取威虎山》、《海港》在北京演出，拚命地抵制江青同志领导的文艺革命。尤其令人愤慨的是，肖望东的这一系列罪恶活动，都发生在八届十一中全会以后，这更充分暴露了肖望东对无产阶级司令部的刻骨仇恨。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在八届十一中全会之后，又于十月份亲自主持召开了中央工作会议。这两次会议，进一步揭开了资产阶级司令部的盖子，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产。但是，就在这次中央工作会议上，反动透顶的肖望东，仍然死跟党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，疯狂地为他们推行的资产阶级反动路线辩护，极力对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，肆无忌惮地进行反扑。他在会上发言时，继续恶毒诬蔑广大革命群众，一再叫嚣：“文化部可以依靠的只有四、五十人，其他都烂掉了”。文化部“干部中除少数从部队调来的好一些，其他都完了”。“如果别的单位依靠革命多数，我们不行。”他还恶狠狠地说：“现在的敌情，我认为还是相当严重的。彭真、陆定一的影响没有好好肃清。如不注意，很可能还有一个大反攻。”谁是彭真、陆定一在文化部的第一号死党？不是别人，正是肖望东自己！现在，这个肖望东居然跳出来大喊大叫要“肃清”“彭真、陆定一的影响”，这种骗人的鬼话，说穿了，无非就是要把起来造他的反的革命群众和革命干部，污蔑为“黑线的社会基础”，把他们的革命造反行动说成是什么“旧势力”的“大反攻”，准备到秋后来一个总算账。这是他准备更疯狂地镇压革命群众和革命干部的舆论先导。他还公然威胁中央文革，反对中央文革坚决支持革命造反派。直到这个时候，在毛主席亲自主持的这样一次庄严的会议上，肖望东竟敢如此疯狂地向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进攻，向无产阶级司令部进攻，真是胆大妄为达到了极点！肖望东完全是一个道道地地的反革命死硬派！
    中央工作会议结束后，新阎王同肖望东更加打得火热，相依为命。他私下对肖望东说：“老肖，要垮我们一起垮！”并且亲自出面，大造谣言，欺骗革命群众，说：“肖望东是毛主席派来的，你们压他一下可以，但不要把他压扁了！”肖望东听后，十分得意，说：“有这句话，就够了！”正是在新阎王的庇护和支持下，肖望东的反革命气焰一直十分嚣张。在中央工作会议以后，他又散布大量流言蜚语，恶毒攻击中央文革；大刮反革命经济主义黑风，欺骗、引诱大批外地文艺工作者来到北京，向中央施加压力（在两、三个月内花去五百多万元）；操纵旧文化部的政治部、镇恶浪战斗队等御用工具，转移斗争大方向，继续挑动群众斗群众；进行罪恶的地下活动，策划假夺权，大整左派黑材料，镇压革命造反派。他杀气腾腾地威胁革命造反派：“不要看你笑得好看，还要看谁笑在最后！”
    打倒肖望东，把文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    马克思说过，人们是自己戏剧的作者，同时又是这一戏剧的演员。肖望东在旧文化部的自我表演可算是淋漓尽致了！
    肖望东本来就是一个老牌的反革命修正主义分子，是一个一贯反对毛主席、反对无产阶级司令部的反党老手。他曾多次恶毒地攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，说：“旧戏是不能演了，你想，古戏上皇帝一出来，威风凛凛的，如果主席坐在下面，他不就会想，在过去我不就是皇帝了，也这么威风；如果元帅看了，他不就比作是宰相了？”他还煽动人们不要“只看到天安门之上，看不到天安门之下”。在他的办公室里，不挂毛主席像和毛主席语录，却挂反党野心家罗瑞卿的所谓“四点指示”。他还公然反对毛主席和林副主席关于突出政治的指示，叫嚣：“不是军事冲击了政治，也不是政治冲击了军事，而是冲击了战士的休息”。他来旧文化部以后，更一再强调要突出中国的赫鲁晓夫，说：“要注意，有两个主席呀！”并且露骨地攻击群众学习“老三篇”是什么“念阿弥陀佛”。资产阶级司令部在两个司令部进行生死搏斗的决战时刻，挑选他来接替夏衍、齐燕铭，充当旧文化部反革命王朝的末代暴君，使他受宠若惊，更全面、更疯狂地施展出他反革命两面派的浑身解数，为资产阶级司令部的反革命复辟活动效劳。肖望东同陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭等，完全是一丘之貉。在十七年来文艺界的黑线统治中，他占有一个特殊的、十分重要的位置，他是这条反革命修正主义文艺黑线的一个重要代表，他对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    肖望东所以在无产阶级文化大革命中，如此疯狂地、不遗余力地推行资产阶级反动路线，目的就是为了保护他所依附的资产阶级司令部，保护包括他自己在内的这条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，保护包括他自己在内的旧文化部资产阶级专政。什么“十七年”、
  “五十天”，对肖望东说来，完全是两位一体、不可分割的。不把肖望东彻底打倒，不批臭他所推行的资产阶级反动路线，就不可能彻底摧毁统治文艺界十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线；而不认识十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线是什么，批判“五十天”来的资产阶级反动路线，也就成了空谈。总之，不把这两者很好地结合起来，就不可能把文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    铁的事实表明：肖望东，他是中国的赫鲁晓夫手下的一名得力干将，是反革命修正主义文艺黑线的忠实推行者，是镇压文艺界无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首。他是一个罪大恶极的反革命修正主义分子！
    现在，肖望东这个翻腾一时的“新的沉渣”已经“沉”下去了，被淹没在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命群众的汪洋大海之中。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，我们无产阶级革命派一定要进一步联合起来，发扬“痛打落水狗”的精神，乘胜追击，彻底地把肖望东批倒批臭，斗倒斗臭！把肖望东，连同整个反革命修正主义文艺黑线和旧文化部的资产阶级专政，彻底埋葬！
