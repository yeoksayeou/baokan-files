Comrades and Friends:

At a time when the people of the whole country are enthusiastically celebrating the new great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the world is entering a new era of Mao Zedong Thought, we are filled with boundless excitement as we solemnly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army of China. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, our Deputy Commander-in-Chief Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, and on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, I extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to all the comrades and friends who have attended this reception!

Forty years ago today, the Communist Party of China led the armed uprising in Nanchang. This was after the Kuomintang had completely betrayed the revolution, under the condition that the correct line represented by Chairman Mao had defeated the right-opportunist line of Chen Duxiu, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it fired the first shot against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chairman Mao, based on the peasant movement in Hunan, personally initiated and led the great Autumn Harvest Uprising and the great march to Jinggangshan, establishing the first Red Army and the first revolutionary base area. This opened up a new path for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, that is, the path of encircling the cities from the countryside and ultimately seizing the cities and the national power. This is a path of victory. This is a great innovation in the history of proletarian revolution.

The People's Liberation Army of China is a new type of people's army personally created and nurtured by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, an army armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This army, in the long and arduous struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies and in the struggle between the two lines, has always firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a true proletarian revolutionary army that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest genius, and the most outstanding commander. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism and is the guiding principle for all our work. Chairman Mao's military thought is the most complete, most scientific, and greatest revolutionary military theory in the history of the development of Marxism, and it is the highest peak of contemporary Marxist-Leninist military theory. Every victory of our army is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade Lin Biao has said: "The people's army built according to the military thought of Comrade Mao Zedong is invincible."

Our Deputy Commander-in-Chief Comrade Lin Biao has held up the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works the best. For decades, Comrade Lin Biao has consistently, resolutely, and thoroughly carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Lin Biao has creatively applied Mao Zedong Thought, led our army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasized proletarian politics, and turned our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, making outstanding contributions to the revolutionary and modern construction of our army. To have the wise leadership of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the direct command of Comrade Lin Biao is our greatest happiness!

Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of people's war is not only a revolutionary treasure for the Chinese people but also a revolutionary treasure for the oppressed nations and peoples of the world to wage revolutionary struggles. It is a universal truth that is universally applicable. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, people have nothing." "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is universally applicable." The path of the Chinese revolution opened up by Chairman Mao is the path of "political power growing out of the barrel of a gun," the path of relying on the peasants, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing the cities. The revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have vividly proven that this path is the only correct path for the oppressed nations and peoples to struggle for liberation and achieve revolutionary victory.

War is a product of the exploitative system and imperialism. Imperialism and reactionaries always rely on force to maintain their reactionary rule and always impose war on the people. The American imperialists and their running dogs hold knives in their hands, killing people every day. In the face of aggressive war and armed suppression, we must never kneel down and surrender, but must fight back resolutely and with determination, using their own methods against them. The heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation has achieved brilliant victories, defeating the so-called strongest invader in the world, the United States, making it desperate and at a loss, and making a great contribution to the anti-American struggle of the people of the world. The victory of the Vietnamese people has once again proven the invincible power of people's war. The brave people of Laos, by persisting in armed struggle, have consolidated the liberated areas that make up two-thirds of the national territory. The revolutionary armed struggles of the peoples of Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries are burning more fiercely. The Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people, summarizing the lessons of blood, are rallying their forces and are determined to take up arms to overthrow the reactionary military rule in Indonesia. Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, the revolutionary armed struggle of the peasants in the Darjeeling region of India has also begun. In the Arab region, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people against American, British imperialism, and Zionism continues and is gaining more and more support from the peoples of various Arab countries and the revolutionary peoples of the world. In the United States, a new revolutionary struggle is rising. Recently, American blacks in Detroit and other cities have taken up arms to fight back against the ruling class of the United States. We are firmly convinced that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, a great storm of revolutionary armed struggles will sweep through the regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and will definitely influence and promote the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the Western countries! This is the irresistible tide of contemporary people's revolution!

Khrushchev and his faithful followers Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like preach "peaceful transition, peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition," while China's Khrushchev peddles "parliamentary road," "legal struggle," and the like. These are thoroughgoing capitulationist roads, roads that bury revolution. Their revisionist trash, along with themselves, has been spat upon by the revolutionary peoples of the world and has become a pile of filth despised by humanity!

Comrades and Friends! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has already achieved great victories and is continuing to achieve new and greater victories. The broad masses of our country have been mobilized to the greatest extent, exposing a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Great Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, people's spiritual outlook has been greatly renewed, industrial and agricultural production has leaped forward, and the overall situation is excellent! Now, a magnificent movement to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is being carried out throughout the country. Revolutionary people are rising up to smash the "falling dogs," determined to criticize them deeply, thoroughly, and completely, and to sweep them into the dustbin of history. The absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought has been further established among the people of the whole country, making our proletarian dictatorship as firm as a rock and more consolidated!

The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road want to usurp proletarian political power and must necessarily collude with the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the army to usurp proletarian military power. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing were once counter-revolutionary revisionists who held important military leadership positions in our army. These two counter-revolutionary revisionists are bourgeois conspirators and careerists who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. They opposed our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, opposed Chairman Mao's political and military lines, and stubbornly pursued the bourgeois military line. They successively colluded with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, formed cliques, and engaged in counter-revolutionary and anti-Party conspiracies to usurp military power and carry out capitalist restoration. The entire army of our officers and soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we timely exposed and smashed the counter-revolutionary and anti-Party conspiracies of these revisionists, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad officers and soldiers of our army are advancing in victory in this great movement of criticism, further purging their poison, ensuring that the people's guns are forever in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries who are loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, making our proletarian state eternal and unchanging!

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the broad officers and soldiers of our army, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions that our army is both a fighting force and a work force and a production force, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to actively support the broad leftist masses and the people's support for the army, and resolutely completed the glorious tasks assigned by Chairman Mao to our army to support the left, support industry, support agriculture, military control, and military training. We are determined to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fight together with the proletarian revolutionaries, and win together, and to defend our great leader Chairman Mao, defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with our lives!

The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the widespread dissemination of the great Mao Zedong Thought among the peoples of the world have made the imperialists led by the United States and their running dogs tremble with fear. The U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries have colluded and conspired to stage one anti-China farce after another, frantically attacking the great Chinese people, attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, and attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. Our Party is a great Party, our country is a great country, our people are great people, and our army is a great army. The anti-China chorus of a handful of scoundrels in the world is nothing but "a few flies hitting the wall, buzzing, a few shrill cries, a few sobs," and cannot harm us in the slightest!

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The imperialists bully us like this, and we must deal with them seriously." All the officers and soldiers of our army and the people of the whole country must never forget this great teaching of Chairman Mao and must be highly vigilant in defending the security of our great motherland. We must definitely liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan. We firmly support the patriotic struggle of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities. We swear to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese people and to stand firmly with the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and we mean what we say. If the American imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries dare to impose war on us, we will break their spines and bury them in the vast sea of people's war, making them never able to rise again!

Now I propose a toast:

To the health and longevity of our great leader Chairman Mao,
To the great victories achieved by the People's Liberation Army of China over the past 40 years,
To the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country,
To the great victories of the heroic Vietnamese people and the peoples of various countries in their anti-American struggles,
To the great victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world,
To the friendship between the People's Liberation Army of China and the armies of friendly countries,
To the health of all the envoys, military attachés, guests, and comrades present,

Cheers!

    我军的每一个胜利都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    杨成武代理总参谋长在国防部招待会上的讲话
    新华社三十一日讯　中国人民解放军代理总参谋长杨成武在建军四十周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    正当全国人民热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命取得新的伟大胜利，全世界进入毛泽东思想新时代的时候，我们以无比兴奋的心情隆重地庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十周年。我代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志，代表中华人民共和国国防部，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向光临这个招待会的同志们，朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢！
    中国共产党在四十年前的今天在南昌领导的武装起义，是在国民党完全叛变革命之后，在以毛主席为代表的正确路线战胜陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的条件下，在毛泽东思想的引导下，对国民党反动派打响的第一枪。毛主席在湖南农民运动的基础上，亲自发动和领导了具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义和向井冈山的伟大进军，建立了第一支工农红军，创建了第一个革命根据地，为中国革命和世界革命开创了一条崭新的道路，即用农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，夺取全国政权的道路。这是一条胜利的道路。这是无产阶级革命史上的伟大创举。
    中国人民解放军是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和培育起来的一支新型的人民军队，是用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的军队。这支军队，在同国内外阶级敌人长期艰苦的搏斗中，在两条路线的斗争中，始终坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，是永远忠于毛主席革命路线的真正的无产阶级革命军队。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代最伟大的天才，最杰出的统帅。毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展的一个崭新的阶段，是我们一切工作的指导方针。毛主席的军事思想，是马克思主义发展史上最完整、最科学、最伟大的革命军事理论，是当代马克思列宁主义军事学说的最高峰。我军的每一个胜利，都是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。正如林彪同志所说的：“按照毛泽东同志建军思想建立起来的人民军队，是无比坚强的，是战无不胜的。”
    我们的副统帅林彪同志，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最好。几十年来，林彪同志一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。林彪同志创造性地运用毛泽东思想，领导我军活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校，对我军革命化、现代化的建设作出了卓越的贡献。有伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导和林彪同志的直接指挥，这是我们最大的幸福！
    毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想，不仅是中国人民的革命法宝，而且是世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民进行革命斗争的法宝，是具有划时代意义的放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”；“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”毛主席开创的中国革命的道路，就是“枪杆子里面出政权”的道路，就是依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。中国人民和亚非拉人民革命斗争的实践，都生动地证明这条道路，是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放，取得革命胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    战争是剥削制度和帝国主义的产物，帝国主义和反动派总是依靠武力来维持它们的反动统治。总是把战争强加在人民头上。美帝国主义及其走狗手里拿着刀，天天在杀人。我们在侵略战争和武装镇压面前，绝不能屈膝投降，一定要针锋相对，坚决斗争，以其人之道还治其人之身。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争，取得了辉煌的胜利，把号称世界上最强大的美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，走投无路，为世界人民反美斗争作出了伟大的贡献。越南人民的胜利，再一次证明了人民战争的无比威力。英勇的老挝人民，坚持武装斗争，使占全国领土三分之二的解放区得到了巩固。缅甸、泰国、菲律宾、马来亚等国革命人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。印尼共产党和印尼人民，总结了血的经验教训，正在集结力量，决心拿起枪杆子，打倒印尼的反动军事统治。在印度共产党革命派领导下，印度大吉岭地区也响起了革命农民武装斗争的春雷。在阿拉伯地区，巴勒斯坦人民反对美、英帝国主义和犹太复国主义的武装斗争，仍在继续坚持，并且得到越来越多阿拉伯各国人民和世界革命人民的支持。在美国国内，新的革命斗争正在兴起，美国黑人最近在底特律以及其他城市，拿起了武器，同美国统治集团进行针锋相对的斗争。我们坚信，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，一场席卷亚非拉地区革命武装斗争的伟大风暴，一定会到来，而且一定要影响和推动西方各国人民的革命斗争！这是当代人民革命的洪流，是任何力量也阻挡不住的洪流！
    赫鲁晓夫及其忠实门徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流宣扬的“和平过渡、和平共处、和平竞赛”，中国的赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“议会道路”、“合法斗争”等等，是彻头彻尾的投降主义的道路，是埋葬革命的道路。他们这一套修正主义黑货，连同他们自己，遭到世界各国革命人民的唾弃，成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆！
    同志们，朋友们！我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大胜利，并且正在继续取得新的更大的胜利。我国广大群众最广泛地发动起来了，揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。伟大的毛泽东思想空前普及，人们的精神面貌焕然一新，工农业生产飞跃发展，整个形势好得很！现在一个波澜壮阔的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，正在全国深入开展，革命人民正在奋起千钧棒，痛打“落水狗”，决心把它们从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，把它们扫进历史的垃圾堆。毛泽东思想的绝对权威，在全国人民中更进一步地树立起来，使我国的无产阶级专政坚如磐石，更加巩固！
    中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，要篡夺无产阶级政权，就一定要同混进军队里的资产阶级代表人物勾结起来，篡夺无产阶级军权。彭德怀、罗瑞卿就是曾经窃据了我军重要军事领导职务的反革命修正主义分子。这两个反革命修正主义分子，是反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的资产阶级阴谋家、野心家。他们反对我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，反对毛主席的政治路线和军事路线，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线。他们先后同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派狼狈勾结，结党营私，进行篡军反党的阴谋活动，妄图实行资本主义复辟。我军全体指战员是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的。在毛主席的英明领导下，我们及时识破并粉碎了这些反革命修正主义分子的篡军反党阴谋，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我军广大指战员，正乘胜前进，在这次革命的大批判运动中，进一步肃清他们的流毒，保证人民的枪杆子永远掌握在忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命派手里，使我们无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色！
    在我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我军广大指战员，遵照毛主席关于我军既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的教导，热烈响应毛主席关于积极支持左派广大群众和拥军爱民的伟大号召，坚决完成毛主席交给我军的支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣任务。我们决心坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，同无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，胜利在一起，誓死保卫我们的伟大领袖毛主席，保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为人民立新功！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界人民中的广泛传播，使以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗惊恐万状。美帝、苏修和各国反动派串通一气，狼狈为奸，演出了一幕又一幕的反华丑剧，疯狂地攻击伟大的中国人民，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命。我们的党是伟大的党，我们的国家是伟大的国家，我们的人民是伟大的人民，我们的军队是伟大的军队。世界上一小撮坏蛋的反华大合唱，只不过是“有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣”而已，损害不了我们的半根毫毛！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”我军全体指战员和全国人民一起，必须念念不忘毛主席的这一伟大教导，百倍警惕地捍卫我们伟大祖国的安全。我们一定要解放我国的神圣领土台湾。我们坚决支援港九爱国同胞反抗英国当局法西斯暴行的英勇斗争。我们誓做越南人民的坚强后盾，坚定不移地同越南人民团结在一起，打败美国侵略者。我们坚决支持全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。中国人民不是好惹的，是说一不二的。如果美帝国主义，苏联现代修正主义者和各国反动派胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就要打断他们的脊骨，把他们埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海中，让他们永世不得翻身！
    现在我提议：
    为我们伟大领袖毛主席的健康长寿，
    为中国人民解放军四十年来所取得的伟大胜利，
    为我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，
    为英雄的越南人民和各国人民反美斗争的伟大胜利，
    为亚非拉和世界各国人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，
    为中国人民解放军同各友好国家军队之间的友谊，
    为各位使节、各位武官、各位来宾、各位同志的健康，
    干杯！
