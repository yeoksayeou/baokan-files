Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousands of words in Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' For thousands of years, it has always been said: 'Oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is unjustified.' Since the advent of Marxism, this old case has been overturned."

However, China's Khrushchev arrogantly wants to overturn this old case again. He openly shouts: "Today, capitalist exploitation is not only not a crime but also has merits." He praises the "merits" of capitalists as being "immortal"! At the same time, he slanders the working class, saying that workers "want you to exploit them, and if you exploit them a bit, they feel more comfortable; if you don't exploit them, they feel miserable."

Pfui! What a traitor to the working class! In his view, it is not the capitalists who are eating the workers' flesh and drinking their blood, but rather the workers who cannot do without the capitalists' exploitation, and it is the capitalists who support the workers. Whose logic is this?

Who supports whom? Take the capitalists' factories as an example. From the capital to open a factory to the profits obtained by the factory, from the establishment of the factory to the production of products, which one is not created by the working class, which one is not the crystallization of the workers' blood and sweat? But in the old society, all this was turned upside down. Landlords and capitalists, relying on their power, created a set of thieves' philosophy, saying that "the factory is opened by the capitalists, and the workers are supported by the capitalists." They said that "exploitation is not a crime," "rebellion is unjustified," and so on, trying to use this to numb the working people, so that the working people could be their slaves. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people, based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "rebellion is justified," rebelled against imperialism, landlords, and the bourgeoisie, and gained liberation and became masters of their own country. But China's Khrushchev came out again to sing the old tune of "exploitation has merits." This further exposes that he is a thorough defender of the capitalist exploitation system.

What "historical merits" does the capitalist have in exploiting workers?! Take an old worker from our school's factory as an example. Before liberation, his whole family suffered from the oppression and exploitation of capitalists. His father worked in a brick factory and died of overwork and bleeding in the kiln. He himself started being exploited by capitalists at the age of nine and lived a life worse than cattle for decades. Every New Year's Eve, the capitalists would hold grand banquets, while he dared not even go home, fearing being caught by creditors. Thus, he endured the long dark years until liberation. Who caused these bitter days? It was the evil exploitation system and the heartless capitalists. This is the "immortal" "merit" of the capitalists! China's Khrushchev praises these "merits" of the capitalists so enthusiastically, which fully shows that he is the filial son and grandson of capitalists and the mortal enemy of the working class!

    剥削有罪！
    中国人民大学“三红”　洪景宾
    毛主席教导我们说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。”
    但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却狂妄地要把这个旧案重新翻过去。他公然叫嚷：“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且还有功劳。”吹嘘资本家的“功绩”将“永垂不朽”！同时，他又大肆诬蔑工人阶级，说什么工人“要叫你剥削，能够剥削他们一下，倒感到舒服一些，你不剥削，他们倒觉得痛苦”。
    呸！好一个工人阶级的无耻叛徒！在他看来，不是资本家在吃工人的肉，喝工人的血，倒是工人离不开资本家的剥削，是资本家养活着工人。这是谁家的逻辑？
    究竟谁养活谁呢？就拿资本家的工厂来说，从开办工厂的资金到工厂所获得的利润，从工厂的建立到产品的生产，那一样不是工人阶级创造的，不是工人血汗的结晶？但是，在旧社会，这一切都被颠倒过去了。地主、资本家依仗他们的权势，创造了一套强盗的哲学，说什么“工厂是资本家开的，工人是资本家养活的。”说什么“剥削无罪”、“造反无理”等等，企图以此麻醉劳动人民，好让劳动人民为他们做牛做马。中国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导下，根据毛主席的“造反有理”的教导，造了帝国主义、地主、资产阶级的反，获得了解放，当家作主了。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫又跳出来重弹“剥削有功”的滥调。这就更进一步暴露了他完全是一个资本主义剥削制度的维护者。
    资本家剥削工人有什么“历史功绩”？！就拿我校工厂的一个老工人来说，解放前，他全家受尽了资本家的压迫剥削。他的父亲在砖瓦厂当工人，因劳累过度吐血死在窑里。他自己从九岁起就受资本家的剥削，几十年过着牛马不如的生活，每到年关，资本家大摆宴席，而他却连家都不敢回，怕被债主抓走。就这样熬过了漫长的黑暗年月，直到解放。这种苦日子是谁造成的？就是万恶的剥削制度，就是狼心狗肺的资本家。这就是资本家“永垂不朽”的“功劳”！中国的赫鲁晓夫如此卖力地吹嘘资本家的这种“功劳”，就十足地说明他是资本家的孝子贤孙，是工人阶级的死敌！
