Hong Kong is Chinese territory.

The British imperialist radio stations and newspapers have recently been arrogantly shouting that Hong Kong is "British territory," falsely claiming that Guangdong Province's rural commune members farming in the New Territories is "invasion" of "British territory," and that the Chinese people's support for the Hong Kong compatriots' anti-British and anti-violence struggle is "interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs," and so on. This is pure bandit talk, a serious provocation against the Chinese people.

Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times. This is known to all the world. More than a hundred years ago, British imperialism, aboard pirate ships, came to China, launched the sinister Opium War, slaughtered countless Chinese people, and forcibly seized our territory of Hong Kong. Then it further annexed our Kowloon and grabbed our New Territories. This is a huge debt of blood that British imperialism owes the Chinese people. This debt, the Chinese people will surely settle with British imperialism in full.

It is precisely because Hong Kong has always been Chinese territory, only seized by British imperialism, that traditionally, farmers from Guangdong Province near the New Territories have farmed there generation after generation. British imperialism dares to call this "invasion" of "British territory," which is absurd to the extreme. Are our commune members going to farm in the British Isles? Our commune members have not stepped out of their own country's territory. On the contrary, British imperialists have come thousands of miles to seize our land and slaughter our compatriots. We must tell British imperialists that not only do Chinese farmers have the traditional right to farm in the New Territories, but the entire territory of Hong Kong must return to the motherland's map.

The times today are no longer the old times when British imperialism seized Hong Kong. Hong Kong compatriots have a powerful socialist motherland as their backing. How can one imagine that Hong Kong will forever be British imperialism's domain? Absolutely not, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways. British imperialism wants to stop the great Chinese people from supporting the Hong Kong compatriots' anti-British and anti-violence struggle, this is just a pipe dream. Hong Kong is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and Hong Kong compatriots are the flesh and blood of the Chinese people. The Chinese people absolutely cannot stand idly by and watch British imperialism's fascist atrocities in suppressing our Hong Kong compatriots.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long solemnly declared: "China's affairs must be decided and handled by the Chinese people themselves, and no imperialist country is allowed to interfere in even the slightest way."

Today, the fate of Hong Kong is in the hands of the Chinese people and Hong Kong compatriots. The affairs of Hong Kong must be decided by the Chinese people and Hong Kong compatriots. British imperialism must not be allowed to run rampant in Hong Kong!

    香港是中国的领土

    港英帝国主义的电台和报纸最近狂妄叫嚣什么香港是“英国领土”，胡说我广东省农村人民公社社员到新界种地是什么“侵犯”“英国领土”，中国人民对香港同胞反英抗暴斗争的支持是什么“干涉香港内政”等等。这是十足的强盗语言，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。
    香港自古以来就是中国的领土。这是全世界妇孺皆知的事情。英帝国主义在一百多年前，乘着海盗船只，来到中国，发动了罪恶的“鸦片战争”，屠杀了无数的中国人民，还霸占了我国领土香港。接着它又侵吞我九龙，攫取我新界。这是英帝国主义欠下中国人民的一大笔血债。这笔债，中国人民是迟早要向英帝国主义彻底清算的。
    正是因为香港从来都是中国的领土，只是被英帝国主义霸占去的，所以在传统上，我广东省邻近新界的农民世世代代都在新界种地。英帝国主义竟然把这说成是“侵犯”“英国领土”，简直是荒唐到了极点。难道是我们的人民公社社员跑到英伦三岛去种地了吗？我们的人民公社社员并未跨出自己祖国国土一步。相反，英帝国主义者跑到数千英里之外，强占我国的土地，屠杀我国的同胞。必须告诉英帝国主义者，不仅中国农民有一切传统权利在新界种地，而且整个香港的土地都要重归祖国的版图。
    今天的时代已经不是当年英国殖民主义霸占香港的旧时代了。香港同胞有了强大的社会主义祖国作为自己的靠山。怎么能设想，香港将永远是英帝国主义的天下呢？当然不能，一千个不能，一万个不能。英帝国主义想要阻止伟大的中国人民支援香港同胞的反英抗暴斗争，这也是痴人说梦。香港是中国领土不可分割的一部分，香港同胞是中国人民的亲骨肉。中国人民对英帝国主义野蛮镇压我香港同胞的法西斯暴行，绝对不能置之不理。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早已庄严宣告：“中国的事情必须由中国人民自己作主张，自己来处理，不容许任何帝国主义国家再有一丝一毫的干涉。”
    今天，香港的命运掌握在中国人民和香港同胞的手中。香港的事务，必须由中国人民和香港同胞来决定。绝不容许英帝国主义在香港横行霸道！
