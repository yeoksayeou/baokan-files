The revolutionary leftists in Beijing held a protest rally to strongly expose the betrayal of Marxism-Leninism by the Miyamoto group led by Miyamoto Kenji. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist leadership, headed by Miyamoto Kenji, recently announced the recall of the JCP's representative in China, Sunama Ichiro, and the *Akahata* newspaper's correspondent in Beijing, Konno Junichi.

On July 18, Nishiya Tomio of the Miyamoto group spread rumors and viciously attacked and slandered the great Communist Party of China in front of bourgeois journalists in Tokyo, claiming that the Chinese side had "exerted pressure" on Sunama and Konno and "persecuted" them.

Relevant departments of the Communist Party of China and responsible persons from the *People's Daily* had separately summoned Sunama and Konno to severely condemn the Miyamoto group for creating this anti-China incident and shamelessly slandering China. They also condemned the Miyamoto group for capitulating to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries. They pointed out that the deterioration of relations between the two parties is entirely the responsibility of the Miyamoto group, which insists on pursuing a revisionist line.

Sunama and Konno left Beijing on August 4. Before their departure, Japanese revolutionary leftists and Red Guards in Beijing held a protest rally. The visiting delegation from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (leftists) of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese Gear Seat Drama Troupe also participated in the protest rally. Japanese revolutionary comrades held high the portrait of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and waved the red-covered Chinese edition of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, strongly exposing the heinous crimes of the Miyamoto group in betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying proletarian internationalism, and betraying the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people.

The revolutionary actions of the Japanese comrades received the firm support of the Chinese Red Guards.

    日修驻华代表砂间、《赤旗报》记者绀野离开北京
    新华社五日讯　以宫本显治为首的日共修正主义领导集团，最近宣布召回日共驻中国的代表砂间一良和《赤旗报》驻北京记者绀野纯一。宫本集团的西泽富夫，七月十八日在东京向资产阶级记者散布谣言，恶毒地攻击和诽谤伟大的中国共产党，说什么中国方面对砂间和绀野“施加压力”和进行“迫害”。
    中国共产党有关机关和《人民日报》有关负责人曾分别召见砂间和绀野，严正谴责宫本集团制造这一反华事件，无耻地诽谤中国，谴责宫本集团投降美帝国主义，投降苏联修正主义，投降日本反动派，并且指出，两党关系的恶化，完全应由坚持推行修正主义路线的宫本集团负责。
    砂间和绀野已在四日离开北京。他们离京之前，在北京的日本革命左派和日本红卫兵曾经举行声讨集会。正在北京访问的日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）访华代表团和日本齿轮座话剧团也参加了声讨集会。日本革命同志高举世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席画像，挥动红彤彤的日文版《毛主席语录》，强烈地揭露了宫本集团背叛马克思列宁主义，背叛无产阶级国际主义，背叛日本人民革命事业的滔天罪行。
    日本革命同志的革命行动，得到了中国红卫兵的坚决支持。
