Two paintings that distort history, "××× with the Anshan Miners" and "Comrade," were created in 1961 and 1966 respectively. These are two poisonous weeds that distort history and erect monuments for the biggest capitalist-roader in the party.

The reactionary oil painting "××× with the Anshan Miners" has spread widely. We know that 45 years ago, the strike by the miners in Anshan was led by our great leader Chairman Mao and achieved victory under his leadership. The Khrushchev of China only arrived in Anshan in the afternoon on the day the strike began. During his brief tenure as a worker representative, he refused to implement Chairman Mao's correct line, colluded with the capitalists, betrayed the interests of the working class, and pursued a thorough opportunist line. However, the Khrushchev of China, in order to erect monuments for himself, instructed his henchmen to distort this segment of history in every possible way. In 1950, after the decision was made to build the Revolutionary Museum, he instructed the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen to extensively promote the idea at the museum that "×××'s early work was mainly in urban areas, but (your materials here) are very few, and not enough is shown." In 1959, after the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang, Deng Tuo, and Qi Yanming seized control of the Revolutionary Museum's preparatory committee, they were even more determined to erect monuments for the Khrushchev of China. They listed "××× with the Anshan Miners" as a key topic. The lackeys worked hard, and the master was pleased. The Khrushchev of China personally summoned a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" from the literary and artistic circles, with ulterior motives, asking them to "describe the lives of miners more," which was actually to extol himself, shamelessly so. Another biggest capitalist-roader in the party also repeatedly instructed the museum: "The exhibition cannot open without a portrait of the Khrushchev of China."

In contrast, they used the excuse of "no physical objects to accompany the exhibition" to plot to remove important subjects such as "Chairman Mao Leading the Strike of the Construction Workers" and "Chairman Mao at Qing Shui Tang," thereby downgrading our great leader Chairman Mao and elevating the Khrushchev of China.

The conspiracy planned by a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists was opposed by the revolutionary masses of the museum. They proposed that to reflect the Anshan strike, one must sing the praises of our red sun, Chairman Mao. Thus, the museum's leaders had to find someone to paint another oil painting titled "Chairman Mao in Anshan." However, when Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and others came to the museum for "inspection," they unanimously shouted: "There are too many portraits and books of Chairman Mao," "This painting is not good," and did not allow it to be exhibited.

Under the strong protests of the revolutionary masses of the Revolutionary Museum, the old Propaganda Department and the capitalist-roaders in the museum played another trick, naming the painting "Chairman Mao, ××× with the Anshan Miners," forcibly equating the Khrushchev of China with our great leader Chairman Mao. However, during the review of the draft, they again said, "Chairman Mao was not present that day during the strike, do not paint it," and did not allow Chairman Mao to appear in the painting.

In 1961, this poisonous weed was completed. Two days before the Revolutionary Museum officially opened, the Khrushchev of China wanted to see a photograph of the painting, so a 12-inch large photograph was hastily sent up. That day, he issued instructions saying that there were no issues. Thus, this poisonous weed was released.

After this poisonous weed was released, the old China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the capitalist-roaders of the Fine Arts Publishing House, under the control of Zhou Yang, immediately actively cooperated, printing and publishing in large quantities, and compiling it into "Selected Revolutionary Historical Paintings" for nationwide and international distribution.

The poisonous weed "Comrade" depicts the Khrushchev of China with a "night soil worker." The process of this poisonous weed's release is even more of a political farce. This was directly instructed by the Khrushchev of China to the author, personally guiding its creation. The author of this black painting had two audiences with his black master. After hearing the painter's creative intentions, the Khrushchev of China hypocritically said, "Yes! It is unimaginable that there are no night soil workers in the city." Meaning, "This is important, paint it well! Look at how great I am." The author fully understood. Later, to encourage the painter's creative enthusiasm, he invited him to watch movies, sent tea, and gifts, making the black painter feel honored and grateful.

The author spent five years of effort to create the black painting "Comrade," which was officially released at the North China New Year Picture and Print Exhibition in 1966. The painting depicts the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the so-called "night soil worker" and "lowly people" sitting together drinking tea, thereby highlighting the "greatness" of the Khrushchev of China and his "love for the masses." The painting was specially hung in the most prominent position. Two publishing houses' capitalist-roaders immediately promoted it extensively and printed it in large quantities. Later, they sent the black painting to other provinces for touring exhibitions, creating public opinion for the Khrushchev of China's usurpation of the party and the government.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be especially vigilant against personal ambitions and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad people from usurping the leadership of the party and the state at all levels." The biggest capitalist-roader in the party is the patron of these ambitious and conspiratorial elements. Today, we must thoroughly criticize and denounce him, along with these black paintings, and throw them into the dustbin of history.

    两幅篡改历史的黑画
    中央美术学院　中央美术学院附中全体革命师生员工
    一九六一年和一九六六年先后出笼的油画《×××与安源矿工》和国画《同志》，是两株篡改历史、为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派树碑立传的大毒草。
    《×××与安源矿工》这幅反动油画，流毒很广。我们知道，四十五年前在安源爆发的路矿工人的大罢工，是在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下取得胜利的。中国的赫鲁晓夫只是在罢工开始的当天下午才到安源；而在他充当工人代表的短短几天中，拒不贯彻毛主席的正确路线，与资本家勾勾搭搭，出卖工人阶级利益，执行了一条彻头彻尾的机会主义路线。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫为了给自己树碑立传，却千方百计地指使他的爪牙篡改这段历史。一九五○年，决定筹建革命博物馆以后，他便指使反革命修正主义分子彭真到革命博物馆大肆鼓吹，说什么“×××早期主要是在城市搞工人运动，但（你们这里）材料很少，表现得不够。”一九五九年，周扬、邓拓、齐燕铭等反革命修正主义分子篡夺了革命博物馆筹建小组的大权以后，更是处心积虑地替中国的赫鲁晓夫树碑立传。他们把《×××与安源矿工》列为重点题目。奴才卖力，主子得意，中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，召见了文艺界的一批反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，别有用心地要他们多“描写矿工生活”，其实就是要他们大肆吹捧他自己，真是恬不知耻。党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，也向博物馆三令五申：没有中国赫鲁晓夫的像不能开馆。
    与此相反，他们借口“没有实物配合陈列”，阴谋去掉《毛主席领导土木工人罢工》、《毛主席在清水塘》等重要画题，以此贬低我们伟大领袖毛主席，抬高中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子所策划的这一阴谋，遭到了革命博物馆广大革命群众的反对。他们提出要反映安源罢工，一定要歌颂我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席。这样，博物馆的当权派才不得不又找人另画了一张《毛主席在安源》的油画。但是，在彭真、陆定一、周扬等一伙先后到博物馆“审查”时，他们异口同声地叫嚷：“毛主席的像和书太多了”，“这张画画的不好”，不准陈列。
    在革命博物馆革命群众的一再强烈抗议下，旧中宣部和革命博物馆的走资本主义道路当权派又耍了一个花招，把画题定为《毛主席、×××与安源矿工》，硬要把中国的赫鲁晓夫与我们伟大领袖毛主席相提并论。但是，在审查草图时，他们又胡说“罢工时毛主席当天不在场，不要画了”，就是不让毛主席在画面中出现。
    一九六一年，这株大毒草炮制成功。革命博物馆正式开馆的前两天，中国的赫鲁晓夫要看这张画的照片，于是便赶忙放了一张十二吋的大照片送上，当天他就发下话来，表示没有什么意见。于是，这株大毒草便出笼了。
    这株大毒草出笼之后，周扬操纵下的旧美协和美术出版社的走资本主义道路当权派，马上积极配合，大量印刷出版，并编入《革命历史画选》精印成册，流毒全国和国外。
    大毒草《同志》，表现的是中国的赫鲁晓夫与什么“掏粪工人”在一起。这株大毒草的出笼经过，更是一出政治丑剧。这是中国的赫鲁晓夫直接向作者授意，亲自指点炮制出来的。这幅黑画的作者曾两次拜会了他的黑主子，中国的赫鲁晓夫听了“画家”的创作意图后，假惺惺地说：“是啊！城里没有掏大粪的是不可想象的事。”意思是说：“这很重要，你好好画吧！看我多伟大”。对此，作者完全心领神会。以后，为了鼓励画家的创作情绪，他又请看电影、送茶叶、送礼物，使黑画作者受宠若惊，感激涕零。
    作者炮制《同志》这张黑画，呕尽心血，整整花了五年工夫，于一九六六年正式在华北地区年画版画展览上出笼。画面上画着党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和所谓的“掏粪工人”、“低贱的人”坐在一起喝茶，以此衬托中国的赫鲁晓夫的“伟大”，“热爱人民群众”。还特意把这张黑画挂在最显要的位置上。两个出版社的走资本主义道路当权派接着就广为宣传，大量印刷。后来又把这黑画送外地巡回展出，为中国的赫鲁晓夫篡党篡政大造舆论。
    毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是这批野心家和阴谋家的总后台。今天，我们必须把他彻底批倒、批臭，连同这些黑画一起抛进历史的垃圾堆。
