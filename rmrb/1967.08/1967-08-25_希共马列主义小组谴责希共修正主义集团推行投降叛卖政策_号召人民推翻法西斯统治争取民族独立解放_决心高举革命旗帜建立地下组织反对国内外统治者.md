The Greek Communist Party Marxist-Leninist Group recently issued an open letter to the Greek people, exposing the fascist rule imposed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Greece, condemning the Greek Communist Party's revisionist leadership for pursuing a policy of capitulation and betrayal, and calling on the Greek people nationwide to fight to the end to overthrow the Greek military dictatorship and achieve national independence and liberation.

The open letter exposes that the fascist military coup that took place in Greece on April 21 this year was orchestrated and organized by the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" in Greece, in collusion with the Greek king and the U.S. imperialist's lackeys—the Greek tycoons and their political representatives. The open letter points out, "The Greek fascist military dictatorship, backed by the United States, poses an extreme threat to the fate of the Greek people." "Tens of thousands of male and female revolutionary fighters, democrats, and patriots have been thrown into new fascist prisons. Tens of thousands of democrats have been pursued and expelled. Some political parties and hundreds of unions and mass organizations have been disbanded and declared illegal. ... The Americans are implementing savage fascism in Greece."

The open letter states, "U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are pushing for fascist dictatorship to suppress the people's resistance, enslave the people, ensure the cheapest labor for the monopolies, and the cheapest blood for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, turning Greece and Cyprus into a volcano against socialist countries and Arab countries in the eastern Mediterranean."

The open letter points out that Khrushchev's revisionism's interference in the Greek Communist Party and the Greek Communist Party's leadership's revisionist policies have led the Greek people astray, resulting in a tragic outcome. It points out that the Greek Communist Party's revisionist leadership has disbanded the Greek Communist Party's underground organizations in Greece and lowered the banner of revolution. They shamelessly advocate for "peaceful transition," "parliamentary road," and "multi-party class cooperation." They are obsessed with begging for the "legalization" of the Greek Communist Party and participating in "general elections," thereby making the Greek Communist Party "degenerate into a weak and powerless guardian of foreign bourgeois parties." They even joined the mad anti-China chorus against the great proletarian cultural revolution in China.

The open letter emphasizes, "Today, the Greek people face an urgent, life-and-death struggle. Marxist-Leninists and the healthy forces within the Greek Communist Party must abandon the Greek Communist Party's revisionist leadership, organize Marxist-Leninist groups to wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism, and regard openly denouncing revisionism's policy of capitulation and actions among the people as their highest duty."

The open letter states that the overall conclusion drawn by Marxist-Leninists is that as long as Greece is under the yoke of U.S. imperialism, there can be no social progress. Without revolution, Greece cannot shake off the rule of U.S. imperialism. Without a decisive break with Soviet revisionism and a resolute struggle against it, there can be no social progress. The struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and socialism is inseparable from the struggle against U.S. imperialism, against foreign lackeys—the tycoon class, and against Soviet revisionism.

The open letter concludes by saying that Greek Marxist-Leninists will organize underground Marxist-Leninist organizations in various places. They will deeply root themselves among the people and, with tenacious work and abundant revolutionary spirit, shoulder the arduous task of fighting against domestic and foreign rulers. They will raise the "banner of revolution, the banner of the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and turn every factory, every village, every street, and every place of life and work into a bastion of the democratic liberation struggle against U.S. imperialism." "Greek fascism will be smashed."

    希共马列主义小组谴责希共修正主义集团推行投降叛卖政策
    号召人民推翻法西斯统治争取民族独立解放
    决心高举革命旗帜建立地下组织反对国内外统治者
    新华社二十四日讯　侨居外国的希腊共产党马克思列宁主义小组不久前发表告希腊人民书，揭露美帝国主义及其走狗在希腊实行法西斯统治，谴责希共修正主义领导集团推行投降和叛卖的政策，号召希腊全国人民，为推翻希腊军事独裁政府、争取民族独立和解放而斗争到底。
    告人民书揭露，今年四月二十一日在希腊爆发的法西斯军事政变，是美帝国主义通过在希腊的“美国军事顾问团”，伙同希腊国王，以及美帝国主义的仆从——希腊富豪集团及其政治代表共同策划和组织的。告人民书指出，“美国一手扶植的希腊法西斯军事独裁政权极端威胁着希腊人民的命运。”“成千上万的男女革命战士，民主人士，爱国者被关进新的法西斯的吃人的监牢里。成千上万的民主人士被追捕和被驱逐。一些政党和数百个工会和群众性组织被解散和宣布为非法，……美国佬在希腊实施野蛮的法西斯主义”。
    告人民书说，“美帝国主义及其走狗推行法西斯独裁专制是为了镇压人民的反抗，使人民沦为奴隶，保证供给垄断集团最廉价的劳动力，供给北大西洋集团最廉价的鲜血，把希腊和塞浦路斯变成东地中海地区反对社会主义国家和阿拉伯国家的火山口。”
    告人民书指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义对希共的干涉和希共领导集团奉行的修正主义政策把希腊人民引入歧途，造成了可悲的后果。它指出，希共修正主义领导集团已解散了在希腊的希共地下组织，降下了革命的旗帜。他们无耻地鼓吹“和平过渡”，“议会道路”和“多党的阶级合作”。他们念念不忘的是乞讨希共的“合法化”和参加“普选”，从而使希共“堕落成为依附外国的资产阶级政党的软弱无能的卫士”。他们甚至还参加了反对中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的疯狂的反华大合唱。
    告人民书强调说，“今天在希腊人民面前，摆着一个十分迫切的，生死存亡的斗争任务。马列主义者，希共中健康的力量必须抛弃希共修正主义领导集团，组织马列主义小组向修正主义作不调和的斗争，把在人民中公开谴责修正主义的投降政策和行动视为自己最高的义务”。
    告人民书说，马列主义者得出的总的结论是，只要希腊处于美帝国主义的奴役下，就不能有任何社会进步。不通过革命，希腊是不能摆脱美帝国主义的统治的。不与苏联修正主义决裂和进行坚决的斗争，就不可能有任何社会进步。争取民族独立，人民民主和社会主义的斗争是与反美，反对外国仆从——富豪集团和反对苏联修正主义的斗争分不开的。
    告人民书最后说，希腊马列主义者将在各地组织地下马克思列宁主义组织，他们将深深地扎根于人民之中，并以顽强的工作和充沛的革命精神担负起反对国内外统治者的艰巨的斗争任务。他们将高举“革命的旗帜，马克思列宁主义胜利的旗帜，把每个工厂，每个乡村，每条街道，每个生活和工作的地方作为反美的民主解放斗争的堡垒”。“希腊的法西斯主义必将被粉碎。”
