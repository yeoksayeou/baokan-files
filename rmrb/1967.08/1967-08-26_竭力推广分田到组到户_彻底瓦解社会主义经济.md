The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is strenuously promoting the "distribution of land to groups" in "state farms" and "collective farms" to further sabotage the original socialist economy and thoroughly realize the restoration of capitalism in agriculture.

According to reports from Soviet revisionist newspapers, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been conducting experiments on the "distribution of land to groups" in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other union republics since 1963. Now, they are promoting this practice across various regions. These "groups" generally consist of four to six people, and some even have only two people. According to the "contracts" signed with the "state farms" or "collective farms," each "group" possesses hundreds of hectares of land and a certain number of agricultural machinery and tools. In the largest rice-growing farm in Kazakhstan, "Dzhelen-Uzyak," some "groups" have only two or three people, and in a group of three, two are a married couple. This is essentially a disguised form of "distribution of land to households." The Soviet revisionist clique is also heavily promoting "material incentives," implementing highly profitable contract production and bonus systems for these "groups," allowing them to arrange their own production plans and organize labor, and distribute income and products within the group according to what they deem "reasonable."

The Soviet revisionist clique is very attentive to using their propaganda machinery to advocate and promote their measures to restore capitalism. In their propaganda, Soviet revisionist publications, apart from attacking the past socialist agricultural economic system as "bureaucratic" and the like, also advocate, under the pretext of "materially caring for production," that state-owned land be "legally fixed" for these "groups" for long-term cultivation, turning these "groups" into "independent production units" and "true owners of the land."

The Soviet revisionist clique also openly advocates "fixing" land to individuals. An article published in *Komsomolskaya Pravda* proclaims, "Fixing land to an individual, handing over technical equipment and economic accounting rights to him, making his happiness depend on the final products obtained from this piece of land. Thus, the public becomes one's own, and one's own becomes public, and labor will become meaningful and enjoyable." The article then exclaims, "The direction has been determined, advance more firmly and vigorously in this direction."

The Soviet revisionist clique's retrograde actions further deepen the class differentiation in the Soviet countryside, making the broad masses of peasants see through their traitorous faces more clearly.

    竭力推广分田到组到户  彻底瓦解社会主义经济
    苏联修正主义领导集团正在“国营农场”和“集体农庄”中推广“分田到组”，以进一步瓦解原来的社会主义经济，彻底在农业中实现资本主义复辟。
    据苏修报纸报道：苏修领导集团从一九六三年起，就陆续在俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、哈萨克等加盟共和国进行“分田到组”的试验，现在正在各地加以推广。这些“小组”，一般由四人到六人组成，有的甚至只有两人。按照同“国营农场”或“集体农庄”订立的“合同”，每个“小组”拥有数百公顷土地和一定数量的农业机器、工具。在哈萨克最大的种稻的“捷连—乌齐亚克”农场，有的“小组”就只有两三个人，而在一个由三人组成的“小组”中，有两人就是一对夫妇。这实际上是实行变相的“分田到户”。苏修集团并大搞“物质刺激”，对这些“小组”实行十分有利可图的包产奖励办法，让它们自行安排生产计划和组织劳动，并且按照它们认为“合理的”方式在组内分配收入和产品。
    苏修集团非常注意开动他们的宣传机器，来鼓吹和推广他们这种复辟资本主义的措施。苏修报刊在宣传中除大肆攻击过去的社会主义的农业经济制度是什么“官僚主义的”等等之外，并在所谓“从物质上关心生产”的幌子下，鼓吹把国有化的土地“从法律上固定给”这些“小组”长期耕种，使这些“小组”变为“独立的生产单位”、“土地的真正主人”。
    苏修集团还公开鼓吹把土地“固定给”个人。《共青团真理报》刊登的一篇文章宣扬说，“把土地固定给一个人，把技术设备和经济核算权交到他的手中，使他的幸福取决于最终从这块土地上获得的产品。这样，公共的就成为自己的，而自己的也成为公共的，劳动就将成为有意义的、愉快的事情。”文章接着叫嚷“方向已经确定了，朝着这个方向更加坚定地、更加奋发地一直前进吧”。
    苏修集团采取的这种倒行逆施的作法，进一步加深了苏联农村的阶级分化，将使广大农民更加看清他们的叛徒面目。
