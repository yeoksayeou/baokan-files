The people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Burma are growing stronger and have dealt heavy blows to the Ne Win reactionary government. Reactionary newspapers in Burma and newspapers from the United States and Britain have expressed alarm at the rapid development of the people's armed forces in Burma.

As early as the first half of last year, newspapers in the United States and Japan had revealed that the people's armed forces in Burma were actively striking in various places. The *New York Times Magazine* reported on February 27 last year that the Burmese government "controls two-thirds of the country during the day, but only half at night." It added that "even in the Irrawaddy Delta near Rangoon, the dissidents (referring to the Burmese people's armed forces) control certain areas." The *Japan Times* reported in April last year that the activities of the Burmese people's armed forces were "concentrated in a semicircular area around Rangoon" and that they were "very active in southern Burma and east of the Irrawaddy River." It could "engage in combat with the heavily armed government troops during the day." The report also said that in January, the Burmese people's armed forces "had at least twelve major engagements with the government troops, resulting in the deaths of at least twenty-five government soldiers." It added, "In fact, these are only a small part of the numerous 'minor' incidents that occur in the countryside every month."

The proactive strikes and consecutive victories of the Burmese people's armed forces have caused great panic among the Burmese reactionaries. The official *Workers' Daily* of Burma admitted in an editorial on October 19 last year that the Burmese people's armed forces had "simultaneously attacked the rice mills of the Ne Win reactionary government in the towns of Thaton, Pyapon, Mawlamyine, Kyaunggon, Myeik, and Pyinmana." The reactionary newspaper worriedly said that these reports indicated that the Burmese people's armed forces had "begun planned activities in these areas."

On May 13 this year, the Burmese people's armed forces attacked the town of Kyaukpadaung on the Rangoon-Pyay railway line. The reactionary newspaper *The Mirror* exclaimed that this was a "challenge" from the people's armed forces to the Burmese reactionaries. An article in the British *Irish Times* on May 25 described the plight of the Ne Win reactionary government, saying that the "police stations were attacked," "weapons were seized," and "supplies from one town to another needed an escort. A colonel going from Rangoon to Heho Airport was escorted home by soldiers in two trucks." The article also said, "Due to supply problems, the government troops had difficulties in their operations. Military actions at the battalion or company level would stop when supplies were not available."

The flexible and mobile strategies and tactics adopted by the Burmese people's armed forces have made the Burmese reactionaries tremble with fear. Since May, the reactionary newspapers in Burma have revealed some examples of the people's armed forces' elusive combat operations. According to the reactionary newspaper *The Guardian*, the people's armed forces often concentrated superior forces to attack the reactionary government's strongholds. "When they launch a surprise attack, the outposts rarely have any effective resistance." An editorial in the official *Workers' Daily* in May, in a fit of anger, attacked the Burmese people's armed forces for "violating the fundamental principles of guerrilla warfare." However, this reactionary newspaper had to admit that the failures of the Burmese military and police were due to the lack of support from the people.

    缅共人民武装沉重打击奈温反动政府
    缅报和美英报刊惊呼人民武装主动出击使缅甸反动派十分恐慌
    新华社十八日讯　本社记者报道：缅甸共产党领导下的人民武装日益发展壮大，沉重地打击了奈温反动政府。缅甸反动报纸和美、英帝国主义的报刊，都对缅甸人民武装的迅速发展感到惊慌不安。
    早在去年上半年，美国和日本的报刊就透露了缅甸人民武装在各地广泛出击的情况。《纽约时报杂志》去年二月二十七日的报道说，缅甸政府“在白天控制这个国家的三分之二的地区，夜间只能控制二分之一”，“甚至在仰光附近的伊洛瓦底江三角洲，不满分子（指缅甸人民武装）就控制着某些地区”。《日本时报》去年四月的一篇报道说，缅甸人民武装的活动“集中于仰光周围的一个半月形地带”，“在缅甸南部及伊洛瓦底江以东一带很活跃”。它可以“在白天与重装备的政府军交锋”。这篇报道还说，缅甸人民武装在一月份当中，“至少与政府军发生过十二次激战，在战争中死亡的至少有政府军二十五名”。“事实上，这些只是一小部分，不包括大批每月在乡间发生的‘小’事件。”
    缅甸人民武装主动出击，接连获胜，引起缅甸反动派极大的恐慌。缅甸官方的《劳动人民日报》去年十月十九日的社论承认，缅甸人民武装“在同一时间内在第德耶、壁磅、毛淡棉遵、恭勿倪、渺?和勃生等市镇”袭击奈温反动政府的米厂。这家反动报纸忧心忡忡地说，这些消息表明缅甸人民武装“在这些地区开始有计划地进行”活动。
    缅甸人民武装今年五月十三日攻入仰光—卑谬铁路线上的九彬高镇。缅甸反动报纸《镜报》惊呼，这是人民武装对缅甸反动派的“挑战”。英国的《爱尔兰时报》五月二十五日的文章在描写奈温反动政府到处挨打的狼狈相时说，缅甸反动政府的“警察局遭到攻击”，“武器被缴”，“供应物资从一个城镇到另一城镇需要护送。从仰光到赫河机场去的一名上校，由两辆卡车载的士兵护送回家。”文章还说：“由于补给问题，政府军的作战有麻烦。军方展开的连或营规模的行动在补给接济不上时就停顿下来。”
    缅甸人民武装采取的机动灵活的战略战术，使缅甸反动派胆战心惊。缅甸反动报纸从五月以来，透露了一些缅甸人民武装神出鬼没的作战的事例。据缅甸反动报纸《卫报》报道，人民武装常常集中优势兵力向反动政府军的据点发动进攻，“当他们进行突然袭击的时候，哨所很少可能作任何有效的抵抗。”官方的《劳动人民日报》五月间的一篇社论，老羞成怒地攻击缅甸人民武装“违反游击战的根本规律”。但是，这家反动报纸不得不承认，缅甸军警的失败是因为他们得不到人民的支持。
