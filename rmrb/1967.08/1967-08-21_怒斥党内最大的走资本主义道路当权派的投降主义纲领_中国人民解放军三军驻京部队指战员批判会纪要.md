Edition: 3

The editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine notes: The biggest capitalist-roader in the party, in February 1, 1946, issued a so-called *Report on the Current Situation*. This report, at a critical moment when the fate of our country and its future were being decided, catered to the needs of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang's reactionary forces, spreading illusions of peace and numbing the revolutionary spirit of the people; opposing armed struggle, advocating the abolition of our party's leadership over the military, and handing over the people's army to the Kuomintang; promoting the path of class cooperation and peaceful transition through parliamentary means. This is a thoroughly capitulationist and reactionary program, a complete exposure of the treacherous, counter-revolutionary face of China's Khrushchev.

Now, this magazine will publish the speeches of some officers and soldiers from the PLA Air Force, Navy, and Second Artillery who criticized the *Report on the Current Situation*, which have been compiled and edited.

*The Report on the Current Situation* is a capitulationist, reactionary program

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, "if there was opportunism in this period, it was the failure to struggle and the voluntary surrender of the fruits that the people should have obtained to Chiang Kai-shek." The biggest capitalist-roader in the party is such an opportunist. He openly included the big bourgeoisie, represented by the despot Chiang Kai-shek, among the "three types of people" (i.e., the so-called "laboring people, middle bourgeoisie, and part of the big bourgeoisie"), and wanted us to hand over the military to the "Ministry of Defense" (i.e., the reactionary government's Ministry of Defense of the Kuomintang), thereby betraying the Chinese revolution. His *Report on the Current Situation* is a reactionary program of surrender to U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, an ironclad proof of his betrayal of the proletarian revolution. (Commander of the Second Artillery Headquarters, Yan Jian'an)

In early 1946, the Kuomintang was "fighting small battles inside the passes and large battles outside the passes," launching a frenzied attack on the liberated areas, with gunfire everywhere. Yet China's Khrushchev said, "The nationwide war has stopped," "There will be no civil war," and further said, "Not believing that the civil war will stop, not believing that the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek will not attack us, not believing that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek can carry out democratic reforms, not believing that they can work with us to build a democratic country," is "leftist exclusivism." The "not believing" he attacked is very good. Chairman Mao pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek "is an extremely cruel and extremely cunning person," "According to Chiang Kai-shek's policy, he wants to fight a civil war." It is precisely by following Chairman Mao's teachings, not believing Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" and "democracy" lies, that we were fully prepared and crushed Chiang Kai-shek's attack, achieving the great victory of the War of Liberation. (Commander of the Air Force Headquarters, Mei Meiren)

While China's Khrushchev was frantically advocating "peace," U.S. imperialism was helping the Kuomintang reactionaries transport troops to attack the liberated areas every day, and even directly deployed marines to occupy Shanghai, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. The Northeast was in the midst of a major battle, and the war inside the passes had not stopped for a single day. Some units, having just finished a battle and buried the bodies of their comrades, returned to listen to China's Khrushchev's "peace talk." Soldiers, with their rifles still warm from the battle, sarcastically said, "Go, peace!" China's Khrushchev's *Report on the Current Situation* is a smoke screen for the "peace" deception of the U.S.-Kuomintang reactionaries, a soft knife helping the U.S.-Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the Chinese people. (Political Department of the Second Artillery Headquarters, Li Lijin)

China's Khrushchev insisted that the head of U.S. imperialism, Truman, would "want China to move towards democratization," and insisted that U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are "peace-loving." This is to make people believe that the nature of the U.S.-Kuomintang reactionaries has changed. This is all nonsense. After being driven out of the mainland for 18 years, the U.S. and Chiang's bandits still have not changed their thieving hearts. The United States occupies our territory of Taiwan, and its planes and warships frequently violate our airspace and territorial waters; the Kuomintang bandits frequently carry out harassment and sabotage, attempting to counterattack the mainland. The nature of all class enemies will never change. (First-class hero of the East China Sea Battle, electrician of the marine tiger boat, Wang Muchang)

The enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, has always peddled a set of robber logic, slandering the people's army as a "private army," and saying that to eliminate civil war, the people must "hand over the army." China's Khrushchev sings the same tune as Chiang Kai-shek, also saying, "Your private army, his private army, it will cause division, war, and democratization is impossible, so concessions must be made." China's Khrushchev is completely a running dog and accomplice of Chiang Kai-shek. (Five Good Soldiers of a certain unit of the Second Artillery, Liang Jinxi)

"The fundamental question of all revolutions is the question of state power." In the old society, we suffered greatly because we had no power; in the new society, we are sweet because we have our own power. China's Khrushchev's *Report on the Current Situation* does not mention a single word about the proletariat seizing power by force, but shamelessly shouts: "The Kuomintang and other parties will also come to the liberated areas to operate, set up news agencies, publish newspapers, set up party branches, talk about unity, and hope that the Communist Party will also give democracy, and the Kuomintang will also participate in our government." This traitor is not seizing power from the big landlords and big bourgeoisie for the people, but seizing power from the people for the big landlords and big bourgeoisie! (First-class hero of the 86 Sea Battle, original instructor of the marine vanguard boat, Xu Shouqi)

To admit or not to admit that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has always been the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones, Marxism from revisionism. China's Khrushchev said, "Now we cannot solve problems by charging," "Charging alone is not enough," advocating the abandonment of armed struggle and the surrender of the revolutionary gun. This is a great betrayal of the Chinese revolution and a great betrayal of Mao Zedong Thought. (Commander of the Air Force Headquarters, Zhang Qiyao)

China's Khrushchev shamelessly said, "It is possible to achieve democratic revolution without going through a civil war." This is a pure revisionist fallacy. Without the proletariat using the gun to carry out violent revolution, it is impossible to smash the old state machine, seize power, and achieve revolution. Chairman Mao said, "The whole world can only be changed by the gun." China's Khrushchev strongly opposes this universal truth, which precisely shows that he is a false revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary. (Political Department of the Air Force, Zhao Shujin)

China's Khrushchev shamelessly said, "The army takes a step back, the whole country makes great progress." This is the logic of a thorough traitor! Chairman Mao teaches, "The people's arms, a gun, a bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." The people's army is the lifeline of the people. If the army is "allowed" to be handed over, it is to sell out the fundamental interests of the people, which would not be "great progress for the whole country," but a complete retreat for the whole country, a complete retreat for the world. (Air Force, Yang Fuzhen)

My hometown, Pan Mountain County, Shandong Province, was liberated for the first time in early November 1945. The landlords were fought against, and the land was distributed. In January 1946, our army withdrew, and the Kuomintang army and the landlord return teams counterattacked, brutally killing poor and lower-middle peasants, hanging their heads on power lines. In August 1947, our army counterattacked, and the hometown was completely liberated. The villagers said with tears in their eyes: The gun is the lifeline! The PLA is a big relative! "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." This is absolutely true! China's Khrushchev wants to "allow" the people's army to be handed over to Chiang Kai-shek. He is an accomplice of the Kuomintang and the landlord return teams. (Second Artillery Hospital 304, Wang Zhensheng)

Without the gun, it is impossible to seize power and defend power. In 1960, before the Wanshan Battle, the enemy who had been holed up in a few small islands in the Pearl River estuary did not leave and did not surrender. When we attacked, the gun swept them away, and they cried, "Ah! I surrender." In the 86 Sea Battle, we sank the Changjiang and the Jianmen, which still attempted to resist. Until we sent shells onto its deck, giving it a "feast," it finally surrendered completely. Revolutionary soldiers understand the importance of the gun the best. We did not fall for China's Khrushchev's tricks in the past, and we will never fall for them in the future. (Xu Shouqi)

The gun must not be abandoned. Seizing power relies on the gun, and consolidating power also relies on the gun. If we seize power and then forget the gun, the big and small Khrushchevs in China will rebel, and we will have to go back on our path and suffer twice. During the support-left and support-agriculture work, a 73-year-old old poor peasant excitedly told us, "Chairman Mao is our great savior, the PLA is our backbone. Your guns must not rust." The words of this old peasant represent the wishes of millions of laboring people. We must remember the instructions of the laboring people. Hold the gun tightly and defend proletarian dictatorship to the death. (Combat hero, pilot of the Sea and Air Eagle Squadron, Shu Jicheng)

The parliamentary path is a dead end that leads to the destruction of the party, the country, and the head

China's Khrushchev said that the democratic revolution "basically succeeded through the constitution and the establishment of a parliament." He is China's biggest "parliamentary fanatic." The parliament and democracy of capitalist countries are the ornaments of bourgeois dictatorship, tools for oppressing the proletariat. Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, China did not even have such a hypocritical parliament and "democracy." If we follow China's Khrushchev's way, the April 12 counter-revolutionary massacre will be repeated, and thousands of heads will fall. (Commander of the Second Artillery Headquarters, Hao Weiping)

China's Khrushchev joined the revolution in name, but his real intention was to become an official and get rich. His "parliamentary fanaticism" is "official fanaticism." He infiltrated the revolutionary ranks for decades, dreaming of entering the Kuomintang parliament and becoming an "official of the central government." As long as there is an official position, he can sell anything. Therefore, as soon as the Kuomintang convened the old Political Consultative Conference, he eagerly wanted to hand over the revolutionary gun to exchange for the Kuomintang's "official position." Isn't it clear what kind of person China's Khrushchev is? (Female pilot of a certain unit of the Air Force, Wang Shanhong)

China's Khrushchev said, "In Beijing and Tianjin, we did not enter with guns, but if the parliamentary struggle is good, we can enter with ballots." This is pure revisionism. Our power is not won through parliament or ballots, but is won with one gunshot after another, one stronghold after another. Even to liberate a small county like Zhengding in Hebei, we paid a price in blood. At that time, the battle was very fierce. We forced our way into the city under heavy gunfire. Four ladders were blown up by the enemy, leaving only ours to climb the city wall. We used bayonets and grenades to repeatedly repel the enemy's three counterattacks, blew up the enemy's fortifications, and consolidated the breakthrough, clearing obstacles for the follow-up forces, annihilating more than 2,000 enemies, and liberating Zhengding. I participated in many battles to liberate Guihua, Huailai, Xushui, Cang County, and others, all of which were won in this way. What "parliamentary struggle" and "ballots to enter the city" are all lies! (Combat hero of a certain unit of the Second Artillery, Wang Ru)

"Entering the city with ballots" is not that easy. In 1945, when the Japanese surrendered, our troops had already controlled the vast rural areas of the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangle. However, entering Tianjin was not allowed; rushing to Beijing was not allowed; arriving in Baoding, we fought a battle, annihilated the enemy, and then entered the city. To make us put down our guns and "enter the city with ballots," this is purely a capitulationist product! (Naval Aviation Department, Ji Tingxie)

The parliamentary path advocated by China's Khrushchev is a dead end that leads to the destruction of the party, the country, and the head. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we did not fall for his tricks. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution. After the national victory, China's Khrushchev's treacherous heart did not die. He catered to the needs of international imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries and again peddled the parliamentary path to the Communist Parties of countries like Burma. He is a traitor to the Chinese and world proletarian revolution. (Logistics Department of the Navy, Feng Jiayun)

We will forever advance along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao

After Japan's surrender, Chairman Mao's directive that "the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance should belong to the people" deeply moved the people. At that time, in Jin-Cha-Ji, the following song was popular: "Who plants the crops, who harvests them, who plants the trees, who gets the fruit, we fought for eight years, the fruits of victory belong to no one else." The broad masses and soldiers did not buy China's Khrushchev's account at all and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, engaging in a "head-on confrontation" with the Kuomintang reactionaries. (Li Lijin)

Dark clouds cannot block the sun. China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line cannot stop the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, China's Khrushchev, through his henchman Peng Zhen and others, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the Northeast, attacking Vice Chairman Lin. They said that the strategic thought of "surrounding the cities from the countryside" "is not applicable to the Northeast." Vice Chairman Lin firmly pushed back, resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions, "opening the main road and occupying the sides," dispatching a large number of cadres to the countryside, mobilizing the masses, carrying out rent reduction and interest reduction, distributing grain and land, eliminating enemy remnants, establishing rural bases, organizing militias, and expanding the main forces. In 1946, we voluntarily withdrew from the large cities south of the Songhua River. In the spring of 1947, the great victories of the "Three Campaigns South of the Yangtze" and the "Four Defenses of Linjiang" fundamentally changed the situation, beginning the counterattack. After the summer, autumn, and winter offensives, many cities were recovered, and the enemy was divided, compressed, and isolated in a few large strongholds such as Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. In the winter of 1948, the Liaoshen Campaign liberated the entire Northeast. Then the army entered the pass, successfully ending the Pingjin Campaign. It then marched south, all the way to Hainan Island. It made outstanding contributions to the cause of national liberation. (Political Department of the Navy, Wang Mingsheng)

China's Khrushchev's capitulationist line is a reflection of the revisionist trend in the world after the Second World War. The revisionist leadership of the Communist Parties of many countries such as France and Italy handed over the gun and betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause. It was precisely because of the great leader Chairman Mao's resistance to this counter-revolutionary revisionist current that he led us to avoid the reefs and achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution, giving the people of the world light and hope. As our Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin said, "All our achievements and victories are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought." We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forever advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. (Political Department of the Air Force, Zhang Zhen)

    怒斥党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的投降主义纲领
    ——中国人民解放军三军驻京部队指战员批判会纪要
    《红旗》杂志编者按：党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在一九四六年二月一日，抛出了一个所谓《时局问题的报告》。这个报告，在我国两种命运、两个前途决战的关键时刻，迎合美帝国主义和国民党蒋介石的反革命需要，散布和平幻想，麻痹人民的革命斗志；反对武装斗争，主张取消我们党对军队的领导，把人民军队交给国民党；鼓吹走阶级合作、和平过渡的议会道路。这是一个彻头彻尾的投降主义的反动纲领，是中国赫鲁晓夫的假革命、反革命、叛徒嘴脸的一次大暴露。
    现在，本刊将中国人民解放军空军、海军、第二炮兵部分指战员批判《时局问题的报告》的发言，加以整理选编，发表在这里。
   《时局问题的报告》是投降主义的反动纲领
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：抗日战争胜利后“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是这样的机会主义者。他公然把以独夫民贼蒋介石为代表的大资产阶级，算在“三种人民”
  （即所谓“劳动人民，中等资产阶级中间派，一部分大资产阶级”）之中，还要我们交出军队，“统一于国防部”（即国民党反动政府的国防部），断送中国革命。他的《时局问题的报告》，是向美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派投降的反动纲领，是他背叛无产阶级革命的一个铁证。（第二炮兵司令部严家安）
    一九四六年初，国民党正在“关内小打，关外大打”，疯狂地进攻解放区，到处是炮火连天。而中国的赫鲁晓夫却说：“全国战争已经停止了”，“内战是不会打了”，并且说“不相信内战会停止，不相信说国民党蒋介石不打我们了，不相信国民党与蒋介石能搞民主改革，不相信能和我们办民主建国”，就是“左的关门主义”。他所攻击的这几个“不相信”好得很。毛主席指出：蒋介石“是一个极端残忍和极端阴险的家伙”，“按照蒋介石的方针，是要打内战的。”我们正是按照毛主席的教导，不相信蒋介石“和平”、“民主”的鬼话，有了充分的准备，才粉碎了蒋介石的进攻，取得了解放战争的伟大胜利。（空军司令部麦美恩）
    就在中国的赫鲁晓夫拚命宣扬“和平”的同时，美帝国主义天天帮助国民党反动派运送军队进攻解放区，还直接出动了海军陆战队，占领了上海、青岛、秦皇岛、天津、北平等地。东北正在大打，关内的战争也一天没有停止。有些部队，刚刚打完仗，埋好了同志的尸体，就回来听中国赫鲁晓夫的“和平经”。战士们背上弹膛还在发热的枪，忿怒地讽刺说：“走，和平去！”中国赫鲁晓夫的《时局问题的报告》，是替美蒋反动派的“和平”骗局施放的一颗烟幕弹，是帮助美蒋反动派屠杀中国人民的软刀子。（第二炮兵党委办公室李力兢）
    中国赫鲁晓夫硬说美帝国主义头子杜鲁门会“要中国走向民主化”，硬说美帝国主义和蒋介石是“爱好和平”的，这是要人们相信美蒋反动派的本性改变了。这完全是鬼话。美蒋被赶出大陆十八年，还是贼心不变。美国霸占我国领土台湾，飞机军舰不断窜犯我国领空领海；蒋匪军不断进行骚扰破坏，妄想反攻大陆。一切阶级敌人的本性都是永远不会改变的。（崇武以东海战一等功臣、海上猛虎艇机电军士长王木昌）
    人民公敌蒋介石，一贯贩卖一套强盗逻辑，诬蔑人民军队是“私有军队”，胡说什么要消除内战，人民必须“交出军队”。中国的赫鲁晓夫同蒋介石唱一个调子，也胡说什么“你私有军队，他也私有军队，就要分裂，战争，民主化不可能，所以非让步不可。”中国的赫鲁晓夫完全是蒋介石的走狗和帮凶。（第二炮兵某部五好战士梁进喜）
      “一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题”。在旧社会，我们千苦万苦，就是苦在没有政权；在新社会，我们千甜万甜，就甜在有了自己的政权。中国赫鲁晓夫的《时局问题的报告》，只字不提无产阶级武装夺取政权，却无耻地叫喊：“国民党各党派也会到解放区来活动，设通讯社，办报纸，设党部，讲统一，希望共产党也给民主，国民党也会来参加我们的政府”。这个叛徒，不是为人民向大地主大资产阶级夺权，而是为大地主大资产阶级向人民夺权！（八六海战一等功臣、海上先锋艇原指导员徐寿祺）
    交出枪杆子就是背叛革命
    承认不承认“枪杆子里面出政权”，历来是真革命和假革命、马克思主义和修正主义的试金石。中国的赫鲁晓夫说：“现在不能以冲来解决问题”，“光冲不行”，主张放弃武装斗争，交出革命的枪杆子。这是对中国革命事业的大背叛，对毛泽东思想的大背叛。（空军司令部张启尧）
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“可能不再经过内战达到民主革命成功”。这是十足的修正主义谬论。无产阶级不用枪杆子进行暴力革命，就不能打碎旧的国家机器，就不能夺得政权，革命就不能成功。毛主席说：“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造”。中国赫鲁晓夫极力反对这个普遍真理，正好说明他是个假革命、反革命。（空政文工团赵淑琴）
    中国赫鲁晓夫恬不知耻地说：“军队让一步，全国大进步”。这是彻头彻尾的叛徒逻辑！毛主席教导说：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”人民军队是人民的命根子，把军队“让”出去，就是出卖人民的根本利益，那就不是“全国大进步”，而是全面大倒退，全国大倒退，全世界大倒退。
  （空军某部杨扶真）
    我的家乡辽宁盘山县沙岭区，一九四五年十一月初次解放，斗地主，分了土地。一九四六年一月我军转移，国民党军队和地主还乡团反攻倒算，残酷杀害贫农下中农，把头挂在电线杆上。一九四七年八月，我军反攻，家乡彻底解放。老乡们热泪盈眶地说：枪杆子是命根子！解放军是大亲人！“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”真是千真万确！中国的赫鲁晓夫要把人民军队“让”给蒋介石，他是国民党和地主还乡团的帮凶。（第二炮兵三○四医院王振生）
    没有枪杆子，就不能夺取政权、保卫政权。一九六○年，在万山战斗前，盘踞在珠江口几个小岛上的敌人一直不走，又不投降，等到我们打上去了，用枪杆子一扫，他们才叫：“啊哟！我缴枪。”八六海战，我们击沉了章江号，剑门号还妄图顽抗，直到我们把炮弹送上它的甲板，给了它一顿“饱餐”，它才彻底舒服了。革命战士最懂得枪杆子的重要。我们过去没上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，今后也永远不会上他的当。（徐寿祺）
    枪杆子决不能丢。夺取政权靠枪杆子，巩固政权也靠枪杆子。如果我们夺取政权以后，忘记枪杆子，中国的大小赫鲁晓夫就会翻天，我们就要走回头路，吃二遍苦。在支左支农中，一位七十三岁的老贫农激动地对我们说：“毛主席是我们的大救星，解放军是我们的靠山。你们的枪可不能生锈。”这位老贫农的话，代表着千千万万劳动人民的心意。我们一定要牢记劳动人民的叮嘱。紧握枪杆子，誓死保卫无产阶级专政。
  （战斗英雄、海空雄鹰团飞行员舒积成）
    议会道路是亡党亡国亡头的死路
    中国赫鲁晓夫说什么民主革命“基本成功是通过宪法，成立议会”。他是中国最大的“议会迷”。资本主义国家的议会和民主，是资产阶级专政的装饰品，是压迫无产阶级的工具。蒋介石统治下的中国，连资本主义国家那样虚伪的议会和“民主”也没有。如果按中国赫鲁晓夫那一套去做，“四·一二”反革命大屠杀就会重演，千百万人头就要落地。（第二炮兵司令部郝维平）
    中国赫鲁晓夫参加革命是假，想当官发财是真。他的“议会迷”就是“官迷”。他钻到革命队伍几十年，梦寐以求的就是出入于国民党议会，做“中央政府的官”。只要有官可做，什么都可以出卖。所以国民党一召开旧政协，他就迫不及待地要交出革命的枪杆子，去换取国民党的“官”。中国赫鲁晓夫到底是个什么货色，不是昭然若揭了吗？（空军某部女飞行员王善富）
    中国赫鲁晓夫说什么：“平津我们枪杆子未打进去，要议会斗争弄得好，可以用选票进去”。这是十足的修正主义。我们的政权不是靠议会议出来的，不是靠选票选出来的，而是一枪一枪打出来的，一个据点一个据点拿下来的。就是解放河北正定这样一个小小县城，也付出了血的代价。当时，战斗十分激烈。我们在枪林弹雨中强行登城，四架梯子被敌人炸毁了三架，剩下我们这一架登了城，用刺刀和手榴弹连续打退了敌人三次反扑，炸毁了敌人的碉堡，才巩固了突破口，为后续部队扫清了障碍，一举歼灭敌人两千多，解放了正定。我参加过的解放归绥、怀来、徐水、沧县等许多战役，都是这样打下来的。什么“议会斗争”、“选票进城”，统统是骗人的鬼话！（第二炮兵某部战斗英雄王儒）
      “凭选票进城”，没有那末便宜的事。一九四五年日寇投降时，我们的部队已控制了平、津、保三角地带的广大乡村。但是，进天津，不让进；奔北平，也不让进；到了保定，打了一仗，消灭了敌人，才进了城。要我们放下枪杆子，“凭选票进城”，这纯粹是投降主义的货色！（海军航空兵部纪亭谢）
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的议会道路，是一条亡党亡国亡头的死路。抗日战争胜利后，我们没上他的当，在毛主席的英明领导下，才取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。全国胜利后，中国赫鲁晓夫的贼心不死，他迎合国际上帝、修、反的需要，又向缅甸等国的共产党兜售议会道路的黑货。他是中国和世界无产阶级革命的叛徒。（海军后勤部冯加云）
    永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进
    日本投降后，毛主席关于“抗战胜利的果实应该属于人民”的指示深入人心，当时在晋察冀流行着这样一支歌：“谁种的庄稼谁收割，谁种的树木谁得果，我们流血抗战八年多，胜利的果实谁也不能夺。”广大群众和指战员根本不买中国赫鲁晓夫的账，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同国民党反动派进行了
  “针锋相对”的斗争。（李力兢）
    乌云遮不住太阳。中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，阻挡不了伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。当时，中国的赫鲁晓夫通过他的死党彭真等人，在东北大肆反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，攻击林副主席。他们胡说什么：农村包围城市的战略思想“不适用于东北”。林副主席坚决地顶了回去，坚定地按照毛主席的指示，“让开大路，占领两厢”，抽调大批干部下乡，放手发动群众，进行减租减息，分粮分地，肃清敌伪残余，建立农村根据地，组织民兵，扩大主力部队。一九四六年我们主动让出了松花江以南的大城市，一九四七年春季，“三下江南”、“四保临江”战役的伟大胜利，使整个形势起了根本变化，开始转入反攻，经过夏、秋、冬三次攻势作战，收复了许多城市，敌人被分割、压缩、孤立在长春、沈阳、锦州几个大据点内。一九四八年冬的辽沈战役，一举解放了全东北。接着大军进关，胜利结束了平津战役。又挥师南下，一直打到海南岛。为全国的解放事业作出了卓越贡献。
  （海军政治部王明生）
    中国的赫鲁晓夫所推行的投降主义路线，是第二次世界大战后国际上修正主义思潮在中国的反映。法国、意大利等许多国家共产党的修正主义领导集团交出了枪杆子，葬送了无产阶级的革命事业。正是由于伟大领袖毛主席顶住了这股反革命修正主义逆流，领导我们绕过了暗礁，才使我国革命取得了伟大胜利，使世界人民看到了光明，看到了希望。正如我们林副统帅所说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。（空军政治部章镇）
