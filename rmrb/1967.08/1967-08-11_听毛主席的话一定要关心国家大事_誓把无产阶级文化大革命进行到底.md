Revolutionary masses in Beijing and Shanghai revisited Chairman Mao's great call a year ago, unanimously agreeing that the great struggle of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is the biggest state affair at present, and it is a matter that concerns whether the Cultural Revolution can achieve thorough victory. They must criticize them deeply, thoroughly, and completely expose and denounce them!

New China News Agency, August 10th: Our great leader Chairman Mao, on this day last year, issued the great call to the people of the whole country to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" when meeting revolutionary masses in the capital. Today, as the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution becomes better and better, and a new revolutionary upsurge to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev sweeps the country, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards in the capital, upon revisiting Chairman Mao's great teachings, are all filled with joy and enthusiasm, their fighting spirit is high, and their confidence is unshakable. They are determined to unswervingly follow the course indicated by Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, and thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to create new merits for thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters!

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital, as well as the Red Guards, said that over the past year, under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved one great victory after another. However, the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines has not ended. The central task before us is to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. This is the most important and glorious great historical task, and it is the biggest state affair. They declared: They must throw themselves wholeheartedly into the new revolutionary upsurge of great criticism and struggle, concentrate their firepower, targets, and wisdom, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

Last year on this day, six workers from the Beijing No. 1 Rolling Mill, including Han Xingzhou, who had the happiness of seeing Chairman Mao at the reception hall of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recalled their battle journey over the past year and said, "When we proletarian revolutionaries were suppressed and persecuted, we thought of Chairman Mao's great call to 'pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end,' and we were filled with boundless strength. It was under Chairman Mao's great call that we, together with the revolutionary masses, broke through the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line and, in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, forged ourselves into a mighty revolutionary army." They said, "Now, the great historical task of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters is before us. We revolutionary workers must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, and create new merits for thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters."

Liu Xichang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, leader of the Workers' Congress Core Group, and worker from the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory, said, "Over the past year, we workers have remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and charged forward to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Now, although the bourgeois headquarters have been beaten to pieces, they have not been thoroughly smashed. We workers must continue to play the role of the main force, resolutely defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and strive to complete the great historical task of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters."

Deng Wutian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, leader of the Peasants' Congress Core Group, and team leader of the Zhaoli Brigade in Tongxian County, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao taught us to 'pay attention to state affairs.' The biggest state affair at present is to thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Every revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasant must resolutely arm their minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev to pieces, and defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death."

Han Aijin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and leader of the Red Flag Combat Team, excitedly said, "Over the past year, we Red Guards, under Chairman Mao's call, have carried forward the spirit of 'daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse,' and have launched continuous attacks on the bourgeois headquarters, achieving extremely great victories. However, we deeply understand that the class enemies will not be willing to accept their defeat, and they are always dreaming of a comeback. If we have the slightest complacency in our minds, it means we do not pay attention to state affairs and we will disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, combine the great daring spirit with a rigorous scientific attitude, and thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, making them infamous forever and never allowing them to rise again."

Li Zuyu, a representative of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works at the conference of active learners of the Beijing Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army, with deep affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, said excitedly, "In the new revolutionary upsurge of great struggle and criticism against the biggest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we have re-learned Chairman Mao's great teachings of 'paying attention to state affairs and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end,' our minds are clearer, and our eyes are brighter. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and thoroughly defeat the biggest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing!"

According to the New China News Agency, Shanghai, August 10th: "'Pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!' This is the great call to arms issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses of the whole country on this day last year. Today, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's teachings, with deep hatred for the class enemies, have launched a revolutionary great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, creating a new revolutionary upsurge to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai deeply understand that the great criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is the biggest state affair at present and is a matter that concerns whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve thorough victory. Although the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party have already been exposed by the broad revolutionary masses and have become 'fallen dogs,' they are always waiting for an opportunity to counterattack and attempt a counter-revolutionary restoration. The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai, in the great storm of the 'January Revolution,' seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, but the poison of revisionism they spread has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai politically, ideologically, and theoretically through revolutionary great criticism, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Only in this way can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried through to the end, and the proletarian iron mountain can be guaranteed to remain unchanged.

Recently, the resolution of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee dated August 5, 1967, "Launch a New Upsurge of Revolutionary Great Criticism to Welcome the New Upsurge of the Cultural Revolution," called on the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, at the moment of commemorating the first anniversary of the convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, launch a new upsurge of revolutionary great criticism, and take revolutionary great criticism as the guiding principle to promote all work.

On the evening of the 9th, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai held a struggle meeting, severely denounced the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, thoroughly exposed their various disguises, and further revealed their true counter-revolutionary faces. This grand and city-wide struggle meeting pushed Shanghai's revolutionary great criticism to a new high. In the past two days, Shanghai's "Wenhui Daily," "Liberation Daily," and the editorial department of "Branch Life" have also jointly published articles, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev, and launching a new powerful attack to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

In recent days, Shanghai has been filled with the fighting atmosphere of revolutionary great criticism. From the bustling urban areas to the rural suburbs, from the workshops of factories to the fields of production teams, from schools, shops to alleys, workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards have used various forms such as big-character posters, wall newspapers, criticism meetings, and accusation meetings to criticize China's Khrushchev from all aspects. On the main streets in the city, revolutionary great criticism big-character poster columns are posted everywhere, and the units posting big-character posters include various fronts such as industry, finance, culture, education, health, publishing, and sports. In various forms of criticism meetings, participants include workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, as well as white-haired old mothers from the alleys and primary school Red Guards. Because the broad revolutionary masses have participated in the great criticism movement, an unprecedented and magnificent people's struggle has been launched, and China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai have already fallen into the vast sea of people's struggle.

In the revolutionary great criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai have launched a magnificent movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary masses on various fronts have seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the various black goods of China's Khrushchev. They have turned the revolutionary great criticism movement into the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary masses and Red Guards on various fronts, in the revolutionary great criticism, have used the boundless Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, seized the revisionist black line of the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev extending to their own systems and units, and carried out in-depth exposure and criticism, powerfully exposing China's Khrushchev's various crimes of attempting to restore capitalism; at the same time, they have carried out a thorough cleansing of the poison of the revisionist line on various fronts and departments, closely combining the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units.

The broad proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, proceeded from the overall situation of the revolutionary great criticism, correctly handled the contradictions between revolutionary mass organizations, further promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The consolidation and development of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" have greatly promoted the in-depth development of the revolutionary great criticism.

    听毛主席的话一定要关心国家大事
    誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    北京上海广大革命群众重温毛主席一年前发出的伟大号召，一致认为对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判大斗争，是当前最大的国家大事，是关系到文化大革命能否取得彻底胜利的大事，必须把他们批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
    新华社十日讯　我们伟大的统帅毛主席，一年前的今天在接见首都革命群众时，向全国人民发出了“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这一伟大的战斗号召。今天，当无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好，全国掀起彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的革命新高潮时，首都工农兵和红卫兵小将，重温毛主席这一伟大教导，无不欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬，信心百倍。他们决心坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的航向，乘胜前进，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部创立新的功勋！
    首都广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将说，一年来，在毛主席的英明领导下，无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。但是，两个司令部、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。摆在我们面前的中心任务，就是要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。这是最重要、最光荣的伟大历史任务，这是最大的国家大事。他们表示：一定要全力以赴地投入当前大批判、大斗争的新的革命高潮中来，集中火力、集中目标、集中智慧，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    去年今天，曾在中共中央接待站前，幸福地见到毛主席的北京第一轧钢厂韩兴洲等六位职工，回顾一年来的战斗历程时说，我们无产阶级革命派受到压抑和迫害的时候，一想起毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，浑身就充满了无穷无尽的力量。我们就是在毛主席的伟大号召下，同革命群众一起，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的压制，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，锻炼成为一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军。他们说，当前，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大历史任务摆在我们面前，我们革命工人一定要牢记毛主席的教导，继续发扬革命造反精神，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部建立新的功勋。
    北京市革命委员会常委、工代会核心组负责人、北京光华木材厂工人刘锡昌说，一年来，我们工人阶级牢记毛主席的伟大教导，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部而冲锋陷阵。现在，资产阶级司令部虽然已被打得七零八落，但是还没有彻底摧毁，我们工人阶级一定要继续发挥主力军作用，坚决从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为胜利完成彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大历史任务而斗争。
    北京市革命委员会常委、农代会核心组负责人、京郊通县翟里大队队长邓万田激动地说，毛主席教导我们“要关心国家大事”，当前最大的国家大事就是从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。我们每一个革命的贫下中农坚决用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部彻底砸烂，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    北京市革命委员会常委、北京航空学院革命委员会主任、红旗战斗队负责人韩爱晶激动地说，一年来，我们红卫兵在毛主席的号召下，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反精神，连连向资产阶级司令部开炮，取得了极其伟大的胜利。但是，我们深深懂得，阶级敌人决不会甘心自己的失败，他们时刻梦想卷土重来，我们思想上如果有丝毫的麻痹，就是不关心国家大事，就辜负了毛主席对我们的期望。我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，把大无畏的革命精神和严格科学态度结合起来，扎扎实实地在政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭，使他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。
    出席中国人民解放军北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表、五好战士李祖裕，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，情绪激昂地说，在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大斗争大批判的新的革命高潮中，我们重新学习毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，心更明，眼更亮，我们一定要按照毛主席的指示，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿批倒批臭！
    据新华社上海十日电　“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席在一年前的今天向全国革命群众发出的伟大战斗号召。今天，上海广大的工农兵、红卫兵小将，遵循毛主席的这一教导，怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开了革命的大批判、大斗争，掀起了一个彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的革命新高潮。
    上海广大工农兵、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，深深懂得：对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，是当前最大的国家大事，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否取得彻底胜利的大事。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派虽然已经被广大的革命群众揪出来了，成了“落水狗”，但是，他们每时每刻都在伺机反扑，妄图实行反革命复辟。上海的无产阶级革命派在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中夺了上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，但是他们散布的修正主义的流毒，还没有肃清。因此，一定要通过革命的大批判把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。只有这样，才能真正把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
    最近公布的上海市革命委员会一九六七年八月五日决议《掀起革命大批判的新高潮，迎接文化大革命的新高涨》，号召无产阶级革命派和革命群众，响应毛主席和党中央的号召，在纪念党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的时刻，紧紧地掌握斗争的大方向，掀起一个革命大批判的新高潮，以革命的大批判为纲，推动一切工作。
    九日晚上，上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众举行了斗争大会，对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人的滔天罪行，进行了严厉声讨，彻底揭穿了他们的种种伪装，进一步暴露了他们的反革命真面目。这一声势浩大的、全市性的斗争大会，把上海革命的大批判推向了一个新高潮。这两天，上海的《文汇报》、《解放日报》和《支部生活》编辑部，也连续联合发表文章，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部发起了新的强有力的进攻。
    最近以来，上海到处洋溢着革命大批判的战斗气氛。从热闹的市区到郊区农村，从工厂的车间到生产队的田头，从学校、商店到街道里弄，工农兵群众和红卫兵小将，纷纷用大字报、墙报、批判会、控诉会等多种形式，从各方面批判中国的赫鲁晓夫。在市区的一些主要街道上，到处张贴着革命大批判的大字报专栏，张贴大字报的单位包括工业、财贸、文艺、教育、卫生、出版和体育等各条战线。在各种形式的批判会上，参加批判的不仅有工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、机关干部和解放军战士，还有白发苍苍的里弄老妈妈、小学的红小兵。由于广大的革命群众投入了大批判运动，展开了一场空前未有的轰轰烈烈的人民斗争，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，已经陷在人民斗争的汪洋大海之中。
    在革命的大批判中，上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众，开展了轰轰烈烈的活学活用毛主席著作的大学习运动。各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来剖析中国的赫鲁晓夫的种种黑货。他们把革命的大批判运动，变成了活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂。各条战线的广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，在革命的大批判中，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为武器，抓住以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部伸向本系统、本单位的修正主义黑线，进行深入揭发批判，有力地揭露了中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的种种罪行；同时，对修正主义路线在各条战线、各个部门的流毒，进行彻底的大清除，把大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合了起来。
    上海广大无产阶级革命派牢牢掌握斗争大方向，从革命大批判的大局出发，正确处理革命群众组织之间的矛盾，进一步促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的巩固和发展，又大大推动了革命大批判的深入进行。
