In the great leader Chairman Mao's personally initiated, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary staff of our country's civil aviation system have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have vigorously grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, bringing about tremendous changes in the face of civil aviation. Over the past year, they have guided flight operations with Mao Zedong Thought, deeply criticized the revisionist black goods that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in civil aviation work, and placed the study and propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all civil aviation work. At the same time, they have made remarkable achievements in supporting the cultural revolution and aiding industrial and agricultural production. In the first half of this year, the major production indicators of our country's civil aviation industry have all exceeded the state plan, and the total transport turnover has created a new record since the founding of New China 17 years ago.

Since the establishment of New China's civil aviation industry, there has been a struggle between taking the socialist road and the capitalist road. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have decided to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, to emphasize politics, to insist on the "Four Firsts," and to build a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready socialist civil aviation industry. Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen in civil aviation, however, attempted to drag socialist China's civil aviation industry onto the track of restoring capitalism. Chinese Khrushchev said, "Aviation should make a little money," "Civil aviation is a modern profession, it should be promoted, it should be advertised... it should be loudly proclaimed," "Economic work should be done in the manner of economic work." His fallacies had a very detrimental effect on the development of our country's civil aviation industry. After the proletarian cultural revolution was launched, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the civil aviation system, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, exposed, criticized, and struggled against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary staff of the civil aviation system further established the correct direction for China's civil aviation industry. They decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the glorious traditions of our Party and Army, and take their own road, making New China's civil aviation industry serve proletarian politics. Through the great criticism and struggle, the broad revolutionary staff of civil aviation, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly raised their consciousness, greatly carried forward their revolutionary spirit, and their spiritual faces have been completely renewed.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary staff of the civil aviation system, with deep feelings of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "We must let hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions." They have made the study and propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought the core, essence, and soul of civil aviation transportation operations. They are determined to make every aircraft, every waiting room, every ticket office, and every operational base into a red stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They firmly grasp the direction of struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and according to the characteristics of the different stages of the proletarian cultural revolution, actively and proactively use various methods, such as reading Chairman Mao's quotations, reciting the "Three Articles," singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, reading newspapers, reading relevant documents of the cultural revolution, and performing artistic performances, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to Chinese and foreign passengers on the planes, to sing the praises of our red sun, Chairman Mao, who is the reddest in our hearts, and to angrily denounce the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. This has made the passenger service work of civil aviation stand out in proletarian politics. They not only propagate according to the different identities and specific situations of Chinese passengers and international friends during passenger flights, making them directly feel the great power of Mao Zedong Thought as soon as they board the plane, but also in professional flights, the air and ground staff actively study Chairman Mao's works with the masses at every operational base, propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, and criticize Chinese Khrushchev with the masses.

After the publication of large quantities of the revolutionary classic "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the proletarian revolutionary factions in the civil aviation system, with boundless love for the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, have, with the fastest speed and the highest quality, prioritized and sent free of charge millions of copies of Chairman Mao's works to the people of various ethnic groups in remote areas. To quickly deliver the books to the hands of the people in remote areas, the pilots proactively helped the loaders load the cargo in advance. If it rained, they would cover the books with their own clothes, lift them lightly, and place them lightly, ensuring that the books were intact.

The revolutionary staff of the civil aviation system also sent various documents of the Party Central Committee related to the proletarian cultural revolution to the people of these areas, strongly supporting the cultural revolution in remote areas.

The broad revolutionary staff of the civil aviation system have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to support industry and agriculture. In the first half of this year's flight operations, they quickly transported tools, instruments, materials, and other goods urgently needed for industrial production to various places, supporting industrial production. In supporting agricultural production, the effects of aircraft spraying, weeding, and artificial rainmaking were better than in previous years.

    以毛泽东思想统帅飞行业务，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑货
    我国民航事业出现崭新面貌
    今年上半年，各项主要生产指标全面超额完成国家计划，运输总周转量创造了新中国成立十七年来的最高纪录
    据新华社二十七日讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国民航系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使民航面貌发生了巨大变化。近一年来，他们以毛泽东思想统帅飞行业务，深入批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在民航工作上推行的修正主义黑货，把学习和宣传毛泽东思想放在民航全部工作的首位，与此同时，在支持文化大革命和支援工农业生产方面，都作出了显著成绩。今年上半年，我国民航事业的各项主要生产指标全面超额完成国家计划，运输总周转量创造了新中国成立十七年来的最高纪录。
    新中国的民航事业一建立，就存在着走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的斗争。广大革命群众和革命干部遵照毛主席的教导，决心以解放军为榜样，大力突出政治，坚持四个第一，建立非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的社会主义民航事业；中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在民航的爪牙则妄图把社会主义的中国民航事业拉向复辟资本主义的轨道。中国的赫鲁晓夫说，“航空赚一点钱应该”、“民航是近代专业，要宣传、要登广告……要大喊大叫”、“作经济工作要象经济工作的样子”。他的这一套谬论，对我国民航事业的发展起了极其恶劣的影响。无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，民航系统的无产阶级革命派以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把民航系统党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，并对中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在民航系统的爪牙进行了大揭露、大批判、大斗争。通过革命的大批判，民航系统广大革命职工进一步树立了中国民航事业的正确方向。他们决心遵照毛主席的教导，发扬我党我军的光荣传统，走自己的路，使新中国的民航事业为无产阶级政治服务。通过大批判、大斗争，广大民航革命职工在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，觉悟大大提高，革命精神大发扬，人的思想面貌焕然一新。
    民航系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚感情，遵照林彪副主席“我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地”的指示，把学习和宣传毛泽东思想作为民航运输业务工作的核心、根本和灵魂，决心把每架飞机、每个候机室、每个售票服务处、每一个作业基地，都办成宣传毛泽东思想的红色阵地。他们牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，根据无产阶级文化大革命不同阶段斗争的特点，积极主动地采用多种方式，例如读毛主席语录、背诵“老三篇”、唱毛主席语录歌、读报、读文化大革命的有关文件、表演文艺节目等，向乘坐飞机的中外旅客宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，使民航的旅客服务工作突出了无产阶级政治。他们不仅在客运航行中根据中国旅客和国际友人的不同身份和具体情况进行宣传，使他们一上飞机就直接感受到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，在专业飞行中，空地勤人员每到一个作业基地，也是主动和群众一道学习毛主席著作，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，和群众一起批判中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    在革命宝书《毛泽东选集》大量出版以后，民航系统的无产阶级革命派怀着对光焰无际的毛泽东思想的无限热爱，以最快的速度，最高的质量，优先免费给边远地区各族人民送去了数百万册毛主席著作。为了尽快地把宝书送到边远地区人民的手里，飞行员主动和搬运工人提前装货。天下雨了，就用自己的衣物盖住宝书，轻提轻放，保证宝书完好无损。
    民航系统革命职工还给这些地区的人民送去了党中央有关无产阶级文化大革命的各种文件，有力地支援了边远地区的文化大革命。
    民航系统的广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席支工支农的号召。在今年上半年的运输飞行中，他们迅速为各地运输了工业生产急需的工具、仪表、材料等货物，支援了工业生产；在支援农业生产方面，飞机杀虫、除草和人工降雨的效果比历年都好。
