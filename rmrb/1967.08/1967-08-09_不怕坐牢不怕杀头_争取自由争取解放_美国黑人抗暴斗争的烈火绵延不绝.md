Despite the frenzied suppression by the U.S. reactionary authorities, the black people's struggle against violence in the United States is like a wildfire, spreading relentlessly. The black struggles in Newark, Detroit, and Washington have been temporarily suppressed by the Johnson administration through violence, but new black struggles have erupted in other cities.

In Wichita, Kansas, and Elgin, Illinois, black people took to the streets again on the night of the 4th and the morning of the 5th. In Wichita, over a hundred black people gathered outside the courthouse to protest the shooting of a black person by a white racist, demanding severe punishment for the culprit. They then surrounded the police station and beat up the police who had colluded with the racist. The black protesters warned the police authorities that if the culprit was not severely punished, they would "burn this city to the ground." The mayor quickly declared martial law, but the protesters continued to gather. They defied the curfew, continuing to attack the police with bricks and stones until the morning of the 5th, and set fire to some shops and vehicles.

In Elgin, about 200 black protesters attacked the police with stones and homemade Molotov cocktails, destroying police cars. The authorities hastily declared martial law.

Since July 30, black people in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, have been engaged in fierce armed struggles against violence. For days, the city has been filled with the sound of sniper fire and flames. The reactionary authorities have sent in heavy troops for suppression, killing, injuring, and arresting nearly a thousand black people so far, but as of the night of the 4th, the situation remained tense, and the city continued to be under martial law. It is reported that many black college students have also joined the struggle, fighting side by side with the broad masses of impoverished black laborers.

The black people's struggle against violence in Wayne, New Jersey, near New York, has also lasted for three days as of the night of the 4th. They have been continuously sniping at the police who have been committing atrocities and setting fire to several shops and vehicles.

In addition, in recent days, black struggles of varying scales have repeatedly broken out in cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, Peoria, Illinois, and Sandusky, Ohio.

The U.S. ruling class is extremely fearful and hateful of the burgeoning black struggle for self-defense. Some Republican politicians have cried out that the black struggle has created a state "close to anarchy," and they viciously demand "swift and decisive punitive measures" against black people who engage in self-defense. Michigan Governor Romney, who brutally suppressed the black struggle in Detroit, again advocated on the 4th to punish black leaders who advocate self-defense as "traitors." Meanwhile, the police in Washington and other cities have already begun to widely equip themselves with weapons that can release poison gas, preparing for more brutal suppression of the black struggle. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. The just struggle of the black people in the United States is not something that the butcher's knife of the U.S. reactionary authorities can suppress.

    美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火绵延不绝
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：不顾美国反动当局到处疯狂镇压，美国黑人的抗暴斗争却如春风烈火，绵延不绝。纽瓦克、底特律、华盛顿等地的黑人斗争暂时被约翰逊政府用暴力压下去了，但其他城市又迸发了新的黑人斗争。
    堪萨斯州的维契塔市和伊利诺斯州的埃尔京市，四日晚五日晨再次爆发黑人抗暴斗争。维契塔市上百名黑人四日为抗议白人种族主义者枪伤黑人的暴行，到市法院外举行了示威，要求严惩凶手，接着，他们又包围市警察局，并痛打了纵容种族主义者行凶的警察。示威黑人警告警察当局说，如果不严惩凶手，他们将把这个城市“烧成废墟”。这个市的市长赶紧宣布戒严，但示威黑人却越聚越多。他们不顾戒严令，直到五日早晨，继续用砖头石块打击警察，并放火烧了一些商店和车辆。
    在埃尔京，二百名示威黑人用石块和自制燃烧瓶打击警察、砸毁警车。当局匆匆宣布戒严。
    从七月三十日开始，威斯康星州密尔沃基市黑人一直在激烈地进行武装抗暴斗争。连日来，市内狙击枪声不绝，火光四起。反动当局派出了重兵进行镇压，迄今已打死、打伤和逮捕近千名黑人，但直到四日晚，局势仍然紧张，市内继续戒严。据报道，不少黑人大学生也投身到了这场斗争中，同广大贫苦黑人劳动者并肩战斗。
    纽约近郊的韦安坦奇市黑人的抗暴斗争，到四日晚也已经持续了三天。他们不断狙击行凶作恶的警察，并连续放火烧了若干商店和车辆。
    此外，在罗得岛州的普罗维顿斯、伊利诺斯州的皮奥里亚及俄亥俄州的桑达斯基等一些城市，近日来也曾一再爆发规模不等的黑人斗争。
    美国统治集团对于黑人暴力自卫斗争的蓬勃开展十分恐惧和仇恨。一些共和党政客惊呼，黑人斗争造成了“近似无政府的状态”，他们恶狠狠地叫嚷要对进行暴力自卫的黑人采取“迅速的和有决定性的惩罚措施”。血腥镇压底特律黑人斗争的密执安州州长罗瓦尼四日再次鼓吹，把宣传暴力自卫的黑人领袖当“叛国犯”惩处。与此同时，华盛顿和其他一些城市的警察，已经开始广泛配备能施放毒气的武器，准备更残酷地镇压黑人斗争。但是那里有压迫，那里就有反抗，美国黑人的正义斗争绝不是美国反动当局的屠刀所能压服的。
