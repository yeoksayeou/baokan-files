Not long ago, U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel launched a large-scale armed aggression against Arab countries. The cannon fire in the Middle East has caused a great stir around the world.

This war was not an unexpected accident. It was a desperate counterattack and struggle by U.S.-led imperialism in the face of the surging national liberation movements in the Arab world and Africa, and in the context of the global situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. This war reflects the sharpening of international class struggle and the deepening development of the world's revolutionary movements.

For various reasons, the Arab countries did not fight well in this anti-aggression war and subsequently accepted a "ceasefire" under the pressure of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. However, the Arab people, filled with indignation against the imperialist aggression and the betrayal of revisionism, continue to struggle, sparking an unprecedented anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist wave.

War awakens the people, educates the people, and tempers the people. The losses the Arab people suffered on the battlefield are temporary; the spiritual benefits they gained from this war will have a long-term effect.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, on the eve of the victory of the Chinese revolution, deeply analyzed how the series of aggressive wars launched by imperialism against China educated the Chinese people, and how the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people had gone through a tortuous process. Chairman Mao said: "All these wars of aggression, plus political, economic, and cultural oppression and exploitation, have created hatred among the Chinese people towards imperialism, making the Chinese people think, what is this all about, and forcing the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people to rise, uniting through struggle. Struggle, failure, struggle again, failure again, struggle again, accumulating a hundred and nine years of experience, accumulating the experience of hundreds of large and small struggles, military and political, economic and cultural, bloody and bloodless, and finally achieving today's fundamental success. This is the spiritual condition. Without this spiritual condition, the revolution cannot be victorious."

The Arab people are also going through such a tortuous struggle process. Through this war, they have aroused revolutionary fervor and learned lessons, which will create the necessary spiritual conditions for future victories in their struggles.

In the past two months, people around the world have been discussing the Middle East war extensively. Different classes and political factions have expressed various views.

What lessons should the Arab people and revolutionary people around the world draw from this war? We will discuss our views in this article.

I

Through the Arab anti-aggression war, the Arab people and revolutionary people around the world have learned a major lesson: they have seen more clearly the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism and have recognized that U.S. imperialism is their number one enemy to the death. This war clearly proves that the contradiction between the Arab people and U.S.-led neo-colonialism is the main contradiction in the Arab region. This war is the result of the intensification of this contradiction.

If the 1956 Suez Canal incident mainly exposed the vicious face of British and French aggressors, and the United States at that time tried hard to play the role of a "good guy"; if the 1957 U.S. imperialist plot to invade Syria and the 1958 U.S. intervention in Lebanon only partially exposed its vicious face; then in this incident, it has been fully exposed. This has profound significance for the Arab people in uniting their forces, identifying the main enemy, striking the main enemy, and solving this primary revolutionary problem.

The Arab region is one of the regions where various contradictions in the contemporary world are concentrated, filled with complex conflicts and struggles.

Geographically, this region is the hub of Asia, Africa, and Europe, with an important strategic position. It possesses abundant oil resources, accounting for about two-thirds of the world's total. Most of the oil consumed by Western European countries is plundered from here. U.S. and Western European monopolies annually extract more than twenty billion dollars in oil profits from this region, with more than half going into the pockets of Wall Street bosses. For a long time, this region has been the target of fierce competition among imperialists.

After World War II, on the one hand, U.S. imperialism has made a major inroad into the Arab region, gradually replacing the positions of Britain and France, implementing U.S. neo-colonialism as an important step in its strategy to seize the intermediate zone and carry out its global counter-revolutionary strategy. On the other hand, the Arab people have widely awakened, and the national liberation movement has flourished. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Arab people have greatly weakened the power of British and French colonialism, overthrown one imperialist lackey after another, and fiercely impacted the positions of U.S. neo-colonialism. The Arab national liberation movement has become an important force in the current world revolutionary storm that directly strikes imperialism.

To maintain its colonial interests and control this important strategic region, U.S. imperialism must ruthlessly suppress the Arab national liberation movement. It has been constantly creating subversion, interference, coups, and even armed aggression in this region, year after year, without end. The Israel, a puppet of U.S.-British imperialism, has launched three wars of aggression against Arab countries in twenty years. This fact concentrates on saying that the struggle between the Arab people and U.S.-led imperialism is a life-and-death struggle. The post-war history of the Arab countries is mainly the history of repeated confrontations between the Arab people and U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "'War is the continuation of politics by other means.' When political development reaches a certain stage, it can no longer proceed as before, and thus war breaks out to remove obstacles on the path of politics."

The war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in the Middle East is a continuation of U.S. imperialism's long-term policy of oppression, plunder, and enslavement against Arab countries. When political means no longer work, it tries to use war to strike at the anti-imperialist struggles of the Arab people, control and enslave the Arab countries, and maintain and expand its exploitation of this region, especially the extraction of huge oil profits. This war, in essence, is a war over oil, a necessary product of U.S. neo-colonialist policy.

This Middle East war once again proves: U.S. imperialism is the root cause of modern wars. To invade, oppress, and plunder other countries, it always threatens military action here today and launches armed intervention there tomorrow, constantly waging wars of aggression. All oppressed nations and peoples in the world, if they want to revolutionize, resist, and strive for complete liberation, must seriously prepare to deal with the armed attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This is an important conclusion that the revolutionary people of the world should draw from this Middle East incident.

However, the Soviet revisionist clique has been trying to cover up the crimes of U.S. imperialism in launching this war of aggression, repeatedly advocating the need to "stop wars" around the world and make war "a thing of the past." This is nothing more than a rehash of Khrushchev's so-called "three-no world," a complete set of counter-revolutionary fallacies. This small group of traitors in the Soviet revisionist clique not only fiercely opposes all revolutionary wars and anti-aggression wars, obstructs the people of invaded countries from taking up arms to resist and expel the invaders, and actively serves as the "fire brigade" for U.S. imperialism; but also desperately spreads illusions about U.S. imperialism, covering up the aggressive wars U.S. imperialism is currently waging and preparing to launch new wars of aggression.

The revolutionary people of the world must not believe the lies of the Soviet revisionist clique. This Middle East incident precisely proves that the desperate U.S. imperialism, with the help of the Soviet revisionist clique, has become even more ferocious.

Now, the U.S. aggressors have one leg stuck in the Vietnam battlefield and cannot extricate themselves, and a large part of their military power has been transferred to Southeast Asia. However, this does not mean that U.S. imperialism will abandon or relax its control and aggression over other regions of the world. Especially when U.S. imperialism has the Soviet revisionist clique as a big accomplice, and at the same time, it estimates that it can solve problems through a quick strike in the short term in the absence of war preparations on the other side, it will be even more likely to launch new military adventures. The suddenness of U.S. imperialism's launch of wars must be fully recognized by the peoples of various countries, who must remain highly vigilant and be spiritually prepared. This is very important, and there is a big difference between having this preparation and not having it. With preparation, one can appropriately deal with various complex situations.

The U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in the Middle East has not and cannot resolve the contradiction between the Arab people and U.S.-led neo-colonialism, but has further developed this contradiction. This war actually added new fuel to the fire of the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle, playing a role in training and expanding the grave-diggers of U.S. imperialism. It once again tells people in fact that against this vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, one must not harbor any illusions and cannot hope to win by chance, the only correct policy is to abandon illusions, prepare for struggle, and engage in a long-term, repeated struggle with it.

Through this Middle East war, the Arab people and people around the world have seen more clearly who are true friends and who are true enemies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is the task of the people of the world." The Arab people, together with the people of the world, further unite, and all countries that have been invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied by U.S. imperialism further unite, and engage in unyielding struggles, will definitely be able to complete this great historical task.

II

Through the Arab anti-aggression war, the Arab people and revolutionary people around the world have learned another important lesson: they have further recognized the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique, recognized the deceptive nature of the Soviet revisionist clique's pseudo-anti-imperialist, pseudo-supportive, and pseudo-aid policies, and recognized the reactionary face of the Soviet revisionist clique's neo-colonialism. This war clearly shows that U.S.-British imperialism and Soviet revisionism, these two types of neo-colonialism, have openly merged.

During the 1956 Suez Canal incident, the Soviet revisionist clique, seeing that the United States had contradictions with Britain and France and knowing that Britain and France would withdraw their troops, quickly made a few big statements and gained some political capital. Over the past decade, the Soviet revisionist clique has painstakingly worked to portray itself as a friend of the Arab people to cover up its neo-colonialist policies. However, in this incident, within just a few days, it fully exposed itself as a dangerous false friend who betrays the Arab people, a vicious executioner who strangles the anti-imperialist struggles of the Arab people, and the number one accomplice who serves U.S. imperialism loyally.

The Soviet revisionist clique's entire activities in this incident were a most shameless performance of its traitorous deeds.

Before the war broke out, the Soviet revisionist clique first used deception and intimidation to tie the hands and feet of the Arab countries. When the Arab countries were suddenly attacked by the U.S. and Israel and were in a difficult situation, the Soviet revisionist clique openly betrayed its trust, stood by, and quickly communicated through the "hotline" with U.S. imperialism, allowing the aggressors to go all out. After the U.S. and Israel basically achieved their military aggression plans, the Soviet revisionist clique then conspired with the U.S. and Britain through the United Nations to force the Arab countries to "ceasefire," solidifying the fait accompli created by the aggressors. Then, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin ran to Glassboro in broad daylight to report to Johnson, seeking rewards, and carried out a global-scale great betrayal.

Lenin once said: "War 'turns the secret alliance of opportunists with the bourgeoisie into an open alliance.' The Soviet revisionist clique's series of betrayals in this Middle East incident fully shows that the Soviet revisionist clique has more openly thrown itself into the arms of U.S. imperialism, and the half-hidden collusion between the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism has become an open counter-revolutionary alliance.

People can see from this Middle East incident: the Soviet revisionist clique pretends to be equal with the United States in peacetime, but when U.S. imperialism draws its sword, it openly kneels down and surrenders, bowing its head and ears to the orders of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique shouts a few nice-sounding slogans in peacetime, but when the anti-imperialist struggle reaches a critical moment, it turns its back on people and openly betrays them. This group of traitors did the same thing during the Caribbean crisis and did the same thing in this Middle East incident, and they will do the same thing in the future. This is determined by the nature of traitors and will not change.

People can also see from this Middle East incident: the so-called "aid" given by the Soviet revisionist clique to Arab countries and other Asian, African, and Latin American countries is not genuinely to support these countries' anti-imperialist struggles. The Soviet revisionist clique's so-called "aid" is completely in the service of its neo-colonialist policy and its counter-revolutionary general line of "Soviet-American cooperation to rule the world." The Soviet revisionist clique not only uses so-called "aid" to exploit and plunder other countries but also tries to use it to gain the right to speak, represent, interfere, and control, in order to increase a few chips to make dirty deals with the United States. This is a typical imperialist policy, a typical colonialist policy.

In 1925, Stalin, in criticizing the nationalist and degeneration dangers in the Soviet Union's foreign policy, deeply exposed the ugly soul of those suffering from this disease: support the liberation movement? Why? Won't there be danger? Won't this cause us to have disputes with other countries? Wouldn't it be better to determine "spheres of influence" with other "advanced" powers and get something beneficial to ourselves? This way, there are benefits and no danger... Today's Soviet revisionist clique is far more degenerate than the nationalist degenerationists of that time. They not only betray the interests of the oppressed nations and make political deals with imperialism but also use imperialist methods to exploit and control other countries; they are also willing to serve as slaves of U.S. neo-colonialism, jointly suppressing the national liberation movement, and playing the role of international police.

The Soviet revisionist clique's promotion of neo-colonialism is not an accidental phenomenon. This small group of traitors, having usurped the leadership of the party and the state at home, have fully restored capitalism, placing the broad masses of people under their oppression and exploitation. Their foreign policy must therefore completely betray proletarian internationalism, promote great-power chauvinism and national egoism; must implement the selfish, profit-seeking, and strong-against-the-weak politics of the bourgeoisie; in a word, must engage in imperialist tactics.

The Second International revisionists once advocated the so-called "socialist colonial policy." At that time, those people merely represented the interests of a small group of worker aristocrats, wanting to get a little leftover from the colonial exploitation of monopolies. Today, the Soviet revisionist clique, under the banner of "socialism" and "communism," uses the state power they control to promote neo-colonialism, seeking the private interests of the domestic bourgeois privileged class and serving the Wall Street big bosses.

In short, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are of the same ilk. Believing in U.S. imperialism and living on U.S. "aid" will inevitably lead to being controlled by U.S. imperialism and becoming its lackey. If one is infatuated with the Soviet revisionists and relies on Soviet "aid," one will also be controlled by the Soviet revisionists, eventually becoming their lackey and even the lackey of U.S. imperialism.

An Arab person wrote in a letter to the Soviet revisionist clique's embassy in the United Arab Republic: "Gentlemen, now we understand what you have done. We now know what revisionism is. If we were deceived by you in the past, it is a painful lesson we will never forget, and we will never be deceived by you again."

Obviously, after this Middle East incident, the Soviet revisionist clique will find it even harder to deceive people. However, this small group of traitors cannot survive without deception. Today, their deception has failed, but tomorrow they will come up with new tricks to deceive people. Therefore, we must not let the Soviet revisionist clique get away with it, but must use this incident to thoroughly expose their true colors and educate the broad masses of the people.

Firmly exposing the reactionary essence of the new colonialism formed by the combination of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, carrying out the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle to the end, and carrying out the struggle against U.S.-led neo-colonialism to the end, this is the current battle task of the revolutionary people of the Arab world and all countries.

III

Through the Arab anti-aggression war, the Arab people and revolutionary people around the world have also learned important military lessons. This war once again tells people that oppressed nations and peoples, to defeat the armed aggression of imperialism and its lackeys, must rely on the theory and strategy of people's war, and any other strategy and tactics will not work.

This anti-aggression war proves that relying on modern weapons is unreliable. Relying on aircraft is not reliable, relying on tanks is not reliable, and relying on long-range artillery is not reliable. Chairman Mao said, weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. Oppressed nations, to defeat imperialist aggressors, cannot rely on modern weapons, nor can they be infatuated with modern weapons, but should rely on the political awareness of the people, rely on the bravery of the people's armed forces, and adopt the strategy and tactics of using one's strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses.

History often shows that those with better weapons do not necessarily win battles, while revolutionary peoples with poor equipment eventually defeat aggressors and reactionaries with superior equipment. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the Chinese people did not have modern weapons, yet they defeated Japanese imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang supported by U.S. imperialism, didn't they? In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was far inferior to that of the U.S. aggressors, yet we fought a victorious battle together with the Korean people. Now, the people of South Vietnam have set a brilliant example. They have beaten the more than one million U.S. aggressors, who possess all modern weapons and claim to have "air superiority," and their puppets into a state of confusion and helplessness. All these victories were not achieved by relying on modern weapons, but by relying on people's war.

This anti-aggression war also proves that oppressed nations, to defeat the armed aggression of imperialism, should not adopt the strategy of a quick decision but should implement the strategic policy of a protracted war. Imperialism is the aggressor, they fear the people, and are infatuated with weapons, so they often adopt lightning strikes, seeking to win the war in a short period, but they are most afraid of the war dragging on. This time, Israel's armed aggression was a copy of Hitler's "blitzkrieg." Against such an attack, the invaded countries and oppressed nations should not calculate the gains and losses of a city or a piece of land, but on the basis of preserving their own fighting strength, rely on the strength of the masses to engage in a protracted struggle with them. In this way, the enemy's lightning strike will be completely foiled, and it will be advantageous to annihilate the enemy's fighting strength, gradually change the power balance from enemy strong and self weak, and ultimately achieve the result of the enemy's defeat and our victory.

This anti-aggression war also proves that a united army without a main force is not reliable. In history, all victorious united armies have had a strong main force, unified command, and overall strategic deployment. Otherwise, they will be defeated by the enemy one by one and will not be able to give the enemy a fatal blow without missing the opportunity.

This Arab anti-aggression war has given people an important military lesson, proving that all those old military theories are not reliable. In military matters, learning from imperialism's methods is not effective; learning from the Soviet revisionists' methods will also lead to defeat.

Throughout history, how many military texts have been written by bourgeois and other exploiting classes? But these books are useless for oppressed nations and peoples.

We believe that in the present era, to achieve victory in revolutionary wars and defeat imperialism and its lackeys in wars, one must rely on Chairman Mao's military theory and a complete set of strategies and tactics. Chairman Mao's great works on people's war are the most complete, systematic, and richest proletarian military science, the highest peak of Marxist-Leninist military thought, and the magic weapon for the international proletariat and all oppressed nations and peoples to defeat their enemies. As long as one masters this magic weapon, no imperialism and reactionaries will be able to deal with the revolutionary people, and the revolutionary people will be able to defeat any imperialism and reactionaries.

IV

Through this anti-aggression war, a series of profound questions have been raised before the Arab people. Why did the Arab countries, with a population of one hundred million and an area of more than one million square kilometers, suffer setbacks in this war? What path should the Arab people take to achieve a thorough victory in the anti-imperialist struggle? Every Arab person who has suffered from imperialist aggression and is struggling for national liberation cannot help but ponder these fundamental questions related to their national destiny.

Now, the Arab countries are still in the historical stage of national democratic revolution. U.S.-led neo-colonialism is still riding on the heads of the Arab people. The Arab people do not want to see their homeland lost, and they do not want to be slaves of neo-colonialism. They have shown unprecedented awakening in this anti-aggression war and the current anti-U.S. struggle. The revolutionary force hidden among the broad masses of the Arab people is invincible. The broad masses of the people, especially the workers and peasants, are the basic driving force of the national democratic revolution in the Arab countries.

The bourgeoisie of the Arab countries, except for the bureaucratic comprador class, has two sides. They are oppressed by imperialism and have a side that is in contradiction with imperialism. They can participate in the struggle against imperialism to a certain extent and for a certain period. However, due to their economic and political weakness, they also have a side that is vacillating and compromising.

Chairman Mao said: "In today's international environment, any heroes in the colonies and semi-colonies must either stand on the side of imperialism and become part of the world's counter-revolutionary forces, or stand on the side of anti-imperialism and become part of the world's revolutionary forces. There is no other path; there is only one of the two."

The ruling bourgeoisie of the Arab countries face such a choice: if they insist on the struggle against imperialism, oppose U.S.-led neo-colonialism, and maintain national independence, they will gain the support of the people; if they go against the will of the people, cannot insist on the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and cannot resist the deception and pressure of Soviet revisionism, they will not only be alienated from the people but will also be overthrown by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists or become their lackeys.

In his reception of Arab and African friends on April 28, 1961, Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the struggle against imperialism, adopting the correct line, relying on workers and peasants, uniting broad revolutionary intellectuals, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie that opposes imperialism, and all patriotic anti-imperialist forces, closely linking with the masses, it is possible to achieve victory."

The current revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. The revolutionary situation in the Arab region is also excellent. The Arab proletariat and revolutionary people, as long as they adopt correct policies, unite all forces that can be united, and join hands with the people of all countries in the world to concentrate on striking at U.S.-led neo-colonialism and its lackeys, will definitely be able to push the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause to new victories.

The Arab anti-aggression war has once again proven to the world a most important truth: all oppressed nations and peoples, to achieve their revolutionary goals and realize their complete liberation, any other path is not viable, the only way out is to rely on the great thought of Mao Zedong, rely on Chairman Mao's theory and policies. Walking the path of Mao Zedong, this is the conclusion.

The cause of the people's revolution has never been a straight-line development. It is precisely from countless setbacks and failures that the revolutionary people can truly find the truth of revolution and the correct path.

The great Lenin once described how the Russian people, over half a century, experienced countless hardships and finally found Marxism, the only correct revolutionary theory, and thus achieved the great victory of the October Revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that the Chinese people also, over more than half a century, experienced countless hardships, twists and turns, and failures, and finally found Marxism-Leninism, the universal truth that applies to all, and the face of China changed.

Now, Marxism-Leninism has developed to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. We are in a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The people of all countries in the world have more favorable conditions to find the truth of revolution and the correct path. The Arab people and the people of all countries in the world, through their own struggles, including countless explorations, experiments, comparisons, setbacks, and failures, will definitely be able to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental guarantee to lead the people's revolutionary struggle to final victory.

As long as the Arab people unite, dare to fight, are not afraid of difficulties, and advance bravely, the Arab world will definitely belong to the Arab people!

    阿拉伯反侵略战争的教训
    周天赤
    不久以前，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列向阿拉伯国家发动了大规模的武装侵略。中东的炮声，在全世界引起了巨大的反响。
    这场战争，并不是突如其来的偶然事件。这是在阿拉伯和亚非拉的民族解放运动不断高涨面前，在东风压倒西风的世界形势之下，以美国为首的帝国主义进行的一次疯狂的反扑和挣扎。这场战争，反映了国际阶级斗争的尖锐化和世界人民革命运动的深入发展。
    由于种种原因，阿拉伯国家在这场反侵略战争中没有打好，接着又在美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的压力下接受“停火”。然而，对于帝国主义的进攻和修正主义的出卖，满怀激愤的阿拉伯人民，仍然在继续斗争，兴起一个前所未有的反帝反修浪潮。
    战争唤醒了人民，教育了人民，锻炼了人民。阿拉伯人民在战场上受到的一些损失，是暂时的；而他们在这场战争中从精神方面得到的益处，则是长期起作用的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国革命胜利前夕，曾经深刻地分析了帝国主义向中国发动的一连串侵略战争怎样教育了中国人民，分析了中国人民的革命斗争曾经走过怎样曲折的道路。毛主席说：“所有这一切侵略战争，加上政治上、经济上、文化上的侵略和压迫，造成了中国人对于帝国主义的仇恨，使中国人想一想，这究竟是怎么一回事，迫使中国人的革命精神发扬起来，从斗争中团结起来。斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，积一百零九年的经验，积几百次大小斗争的经验，军事的和政治的、经济的和文化的、流血的和不流血的经验，方才获得今天这样的基本上的成功。这就是精神条件，没有这个精神条件，革命是不能胜利的。”
    阿拉伯人民也正在经历着这样一个曲折的斗争过程。他们通过这场战争，激发了革命斗志，吸取了经验教训，就会为今后斗争的胜利，造成必要的精神条件。
    两个多月来，全世界的人们对中东的这一场战争议论纷纷。不同的阶级和不同的政治派别发表了种种的看法。
    阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民，究竟从这场战争中应当得出什么样的教训呢？我们准备在这篇文章里来谈谈我们的观点。
                               一
    通过阿拉伯反侵略战争，阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民得到的一个最大的教训，就是更加看透了美帝国主义的凶神恶煞的面目，更加认清了美帝国主义是他们的不共戴天的头号敌人。这场战争清楚地证明，阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的新殖民主义的矛盾，是阿拉伯地区的主要矛盾。这场战争就是这个矛盾激化的结果。
    如果说，一九五六年苏伊士运河事件主要暴露了英、法侵略者的凶恶面目，美国当时还竭力装“好人”；如果说，一九五七年美帝国主义策划侵略叙利亚，一九五八年出兵黎巴嫩，它的凶恶面目还是初步暴露；那么，在这次事件中，则是充分地暴露出来了。这对于阿拉伯人民团结自己的力量，认清主要敌人，打击主要敌人，解决这个革命的首要问题，有着深刻的意义。
    阿拉伯地区是当代世界各种矛盾集中的地区之一，这里充满着错综复杂的冲突和斗争。
    这个地区，在地理上是亚洲、非洲和欧洲的枢纽，具有重要的战略地位。它拥有丰富的石油资源，蕴藏量约占全世界的三分之二。西欧国家所消耗的石油，绝大部分是从这里掠夺的。美国和西欧的垄断资本，每年从这个地区榨取的石油利润超过二十亿美元，其中一半以上进入了华尔街老板的腰包。长期以来，这个地区就是帝国主义激烈争夺的对象。
    第二次世界大战以后，一方面，美帝国主义大举侵入阿拉伯地区，逐步取代英法的地位，实行美国新殖民主义，作为它争夺中间地带和推行反革命全球战略的重要步骤。另一方面，阿拉伯人民广泛觉醒，民族解放运动蓬勃兴起。阿拉伯人民的反帝革命斗争，大大地削弱了英法殖民主义的势力，打翻了一个又一个帝国主义的走狗，猛烈地冲击着美国新殖民主义的阵地。阿拉伯民族解放运动，已经成为目前直接打击帝国主义的世界革命风暴的一支重要力量。
    美帝国主义为了维护它的殖民利益，控制这个重要的战略地带，必然要疯狂镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动。它在这个地区制造的颠覆、干涉、政变，直至武装侵略，连年不断，层出不穷。美英帝国主义一手扶植的以色列，二十年间向阿拉伯国家发动了三次侵略战争。这个事实集中地说明，阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。战后阿拉伯各国的历史，主要地就是阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗反复较量的历史。
    毛主席指出：“‘战争是政治的特殊手段的继续’。政治发展到一定的阶段，再也不能照旧前进，于是爆发了战争，用以扫除政治道路上的障碍。”
    美帝国主义及其走狗在中东发动的这场侵略战争，就是美帝国主义长期以来对阿拉伯国家实行压迫、掠夺、奴役政策的继续。美帝国主义采用政治手段不行了，它就企图通过战争，来打击阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争，控制和奴役阿拉伯各国，维护和扩大它对这个地区的剥削，特别是榨取巨额石油利润。这场战争，实质上是一场争夺石油的战争，是美国新殖民主义政策的必然产物。
    中东的这场战争再一次证明：美帝国主义是现代战争的根源。它为了侵略、压迫和掠夺别的国家，总是要今天在这里进行军事威胁，明天在那里发动武装干涉，不断地搞侵略战争。世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，要革命，要反抗，要争取彻底解放，就必须认真准备对付美帝国主义及其走狗的武装进攻。这是世界革命人民从这次中东事件中，应当得出的一个重要结论。
    但是，苏修集团却竭力掩盖美帝发动这场侵略战争的罪行，一个劲儿鼓吹什么要在全世界“停止战争”，使战争“成为一件过去的事情”。这不过是当年赫鲁晓夫大肆宣扬的所谓“三无世界”的再版，完全是一派彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。苏修集团这一小撮叛徒，不仅疯狂反对一切革命战争和反侵略战争，阻挠被侵略国家的人民拿起武器抗击和驱逐侵略者，积极充当美帝国主义的“消防队”；而且拚命散布对美帝国主义的幻想，为美帝国主义正在进行的侵略战争和发动新的侵略战争大放烟幕。
    全世界革命人民决不要相信苏修集团的鬼话。这次中东事件恰恰证明，日暮途穷的美帝国主义，得到苏修集团的帮助，具有更大的疯狂性。
    现在，美国侵略者已经有一条腿陷在越南战场上不能自拔，它的很大一部分军事力量已经移到东南亚。但是，这绝不等于美帝国主义会放弃或者放松它对世界其他地区的控制和侵略。特别是当美帝国主义有了苏修集团这个大帮凶，同时它又估计到在对方缺乏战争准备的情况下，认为可以通过闪击在短期内用战争解决问题的时候，就更会发动新的军事冒险。对于美帝国主义发动战争的突然性，各国人民必须有充分的认识，保持高度的警惕，早有精神准备。这一点很重要，有这一点和没有这一点是大不相同的。有了准备，就能恰当地应付各种复杂的局面。
    美帝国主义在中东打了这场侵略战争，并没有也不可能解决阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的新殖民主义的矛盾，而是使这个矛盾进一步发展了。这场战争，实际上给阿拉伯人民的反美斗争烈火增添了新的燃料，起了训练和扩大美帝国主义的掘墓人的作用。它又一次以事实告诉人们，对美帝国主义这个凶恶敌人，决不能抱有任何幻想，也不能指望侥幸取胜，唯一正确的方针就是丢掉幻想，准备斗争，针锋相对，同它进行长期的反复的较量。
    经过中东的这场战争，使阿拉伯和全世界人民更加看清了谁是真正的朋友，谁是真正的敌人。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”阿拉伯人民同全世界人民进一步联合起来，所有受到美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家进一步联合起来，进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够完成这个伟大的历史任务。
                               二
    通过阿拉伯反侵略战争，阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民得到的另一个重要教训，就是进一步认识了苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸，认识了苏修集团的假反帝、假支持、假援助政策的欺骗性，认识了苏修集团的新殖民主义的反动面目。这场战争清楚地表明，美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义这两种类型的新殖民主义已经公开合流。
    一九五六年苏伊士运河事件期间，苏修集团由于看到美国同英法有矛盾，知道英法要撤军，连忙讲了几句大话，捞了一点政治资本。十多年来，苏修集团苦心孤诣，惨淡经营，竭力把自己装作阿拉伯人民的朋友，来掩盖它所推行的新殖民主义。而在这次事件中，仅仅几天之间，就集中地暴露了它是出卖阿拉伯人民的危险的假朋友，是扼杀阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的凶恶的刽子手，是为美帝国主义尽忠效劳的头号帮凶。
    苏修集团在这次事件中的全部活动，是它的叛徒行径的一次最无耻的大表演。
    在战争爆发之前，苏修集团首先用欺哄和恫吓的手段，束缚阿拉伯国家的手脚。当阿拉伯国家遭到美以的突然袭击处于困难的时刻，苏修集团又公然背信弃义，袖手旁观，而且赶忙通过“热线”向美帝国主义交底，让侵略者放手大干。等到美以基本上实现了它们的军事侵略计划之后，苏修集团又与美英合谋，通过联合国逼迫阿拉伯国家“停火”，把侵略者造成的既成事实固定下来。然后，苏修头目柯西金就在光天化日之下跑到葛拉斯堡罗，向约翰逊报功求赏，变本加厉地进行了全球性的大叛卖。
    列宁说过：战争“使机会主义者同资产阶级的秘密联盟变为公开的联盟”。苏修集团在这次中东事件中所干的一连串叛卖勾当，充分表明苏修集团已经更公开地投入了美帝的怀抱，苏修和美帝之间半遮半掩的勾搭已经变成赤裸裸的反革命同盟。
    人们从这次中东事件可以认识到：苏修集团平时装作要同美国平起平坐的样子，一到美帝剑拔弩张的时候，就要公开下跪投降，俯首贴耳听美帝使唤。苏修集团平时喊几句好听的空话，一到反帝斗争的紧要关头，就要翻脸不认人，公开叛卖。这一伙叛徒，过去在加勒比海危机中就是这样干的，这次在中东事件中又是这样干的，以后还会这样干。这是叛徒的本性决定的，是绝对不会改变的。
    人们从这次中东事件还可以认识到：苏修集团给阿拉伯国家和其他亚非拉国家一些军事和经济“援助”，决不是真正要支持这些国家的反帝斗争。苏修集团的所谓“援助”，完全是为它的新殖民主义政策，为它的“苏美合作主宰世界”的反革命总路线服务的。苏修集团不仅通过所谓“援助”，来剥削和掠夺别的国家，而且企图借此取得发言权，代表权，干涉权，控制权，以便增加几根筹码，来同美国进行肮脏的交易。这是典型的帝国主义政策，典型的殖民主义政策。
    一九二五年，斯大林在批判苏联对外政策中民族主义和蜕化危险时，曾经深刻地揭露了患这种病的人的丑恶灵魂：支持解放运动吗？为什么呢？不会有危险吗？这不会使我们同其他国家发生纠纷吗？我们同其他“先进的”列强一起确定“势力范围”，拿到一些有利于自己的东西岂不是更好吗？这样做既有好处，又没有危险……。今天的苏修集团比当年的民族主义蜕化分子不知要堕落多少倍。他们不仅出卖被压迫民族的利益，同帝国主义一起大做其政治买卖；也不仅采用帝国主义的办法，去剥削和控制别的国家；而且甘心充当美国新殖民主义的奴仆，共同镇压民族解放运动，扮演了国际宪兵的角色。
    苏修集团推行新殖民主义，不是偶然的现象。这一小撮叛徒，在国内篡夺了党和国家的领导权，全面复辟了资本主义，把广大人民置于自己的压迫和剥削之下。它的对外政策也就必然要彻底背叛无产阶级国际主义，推行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义；必然要实行资产阶级的自私自利、唯利是图、弱肉强食的强权政治；一句话，必然要搞帝国主义那一套。
    第二国际修正主义分子曾经鼓吹所谓“社会主义殖民政策”。当时，那些人无非是代表一小撮工人贵族的利益，想从垄断资本的殖民剥削中，讨一点残羹剩饭。今天苏修集团则是打着“社会主义”、“共产主义”的幌子，利用他们所控制的国家政权，推行新殖民主义，来谋求国内资产阶级特权阶层的私利，并且为华尔街大老板效劳。
    总之，美帝和苏修是一路货。相信美帝，靠美“援”过活，当然要受美帝的控制，成为美帝的附庸。如果迷信苏修，依赖苏“援”，那也会受到苏修的控制，以至沦为苏修的附庸，到头来还会沦为美帝的附庸。
    一位阿拉伯人在给苏修集团驻阿联大使馆的信中说得好：“先生们，现在我们明白你们所干的一切了。我们已经知道修正主义是什么货色。如果我们过去受了你们的骗，那只是我们永远不会忘记的惨痛教训，我们从今以后决不会受你们的骗了。”
    显然，经过这次中东事件之后，苏修集团就更难以骗人了。但是，这一小撮叛徒集团，不搞欺骗就混不下去。今天它的欺骗破产了，明天它还会想出新的花招来骗人。因此，决不能让苏修集团蒙混过去，而应当通过这次事件，彻底拆穿他们的画皮，来教育广大人民群众。
    坚决揭露美帝和苏修相结合的新殖民主义的反动本质，把反帝反修的斗争进行到底，把反对以美国为首的新殖民主义的斗争进行到底，这是当前阿拉伯和全世界各国革命人民的战斗任务。
                            三
    通过阿拉伯反侵略战争，阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民从军事上也得到了重要的教训。这场战争又一次告诉人们，被压迫民族和被压迫人民要打败帝国主义及其走狗的武装进攻，只有靠人民战争的理论和战略战术，其他任何战略战术都是不行的。
    这次反侵略战争证明，靠现代化武器是靠不住的。靠飞机不行，靠坦克不行，靠长射程大炮也不行。毛主席说，武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。被压迫民族要战胜帝国主义侵略者，不能靠现代化武器，更不能迷信现代化武器，而应当依靠人民的政治觉悟，依靠人民武装力量的勇敢，采取以己之长攻敌之短的战略战术。
    历史上常有这样的事，武器好的，并不一定就打胜仗，而装备很差的革命人民终于战胜装备优良的侵略者和反动派。中国人民在抗日战争时期和解放战争时期，并没有什么现代化武器，还不是打败了日本帝国主义，打败了美帝国主义全力支持的蒋介石反动派吗？在抗美援朝战争中，中国人民志愿军的装备也远远不如美国侵略者，然而我们同朝鲜人民一起却打了胜仗。现在，越南南方人民又做出了光辉的榜样。他们把拥有一切现代化武器、掌握所谓“制空权”的一百多万美国侵略军及其仆从傀儡军，打得焦头烂额，一筹莫展。所有这些胜利，都不是靠现代化武器取得的，而是靠人民战争取得的。
    这次反侵略战争也证明，被压迫民族要打败帝国主义的武装进攻，战略上采取速决战是不行的，而应当实行持久战的战略方针。帝国主义是侵略者，他们害怕人民，迷信武器，因此常常采取闪击战，力求在短期内打赢战争，而最怕战争旷日持久地拖下去。这次以色列的武装进攻，就是抄袭了希特勒的“闪电战”。对于这样的进攻，被侵略国家和被压迫民族，应当不计一城一地的得失，在保持自己有生力量的基础上，依靠人民群众的力量，同它持久而战。这样，就可以使敌人的闪击战彻底破产，就会有利于消灭敌人的有生力量，逐步改变敌强我弱的力量对比，最后达到敌败我胜的结果。
    这次反侵略战争还证明，没有主力的联军是不行的。历史上，凡是打胜仗的联军，都有坚强的主力军，有统一的指挥和全盘的战略部署。否则，就会被敌人各个击破，而不可能不失战机地给敌人以致命的打击。
    这次阿拉伯反侵略战争，在军事上给人们上了重要的一课，证明所有那些旧的军事理论都是不行的。在军事上，学帝国主义的那一套，固然不灵；学苏联修正主义的那一套，也要吃败仗。
    古往今来，不知有多少资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的军事家，写了一本又一本的军事学。但这些书，对被压迫民族和被压迫人民，是不管用的。
    我们认为，在现时代，要取得革命战争的胜利，要在战争中打败帝国主义及其走狗，只有靠毛主席的军事理论和一整套战略战术。毛主席关于人民战争的伟大著作，是最完整、最系统、最丰富的无产阶级军事学，是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰，是国际无产阶级和一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民克敌制胜的法宝。只要掌握了这个法宝，任何帝国主义和反动派都没有办法对付革命人民，而革命人民却可以战胜任何帝国主义和反动派。
                            四
    通过这场反侵略战争，在阿拉伯人民面前提出了一系列令人深思的问题。为什么有一亿人口、一千多万平方公里土地的阿拉伯国家，在这一场战争中受到挫折？阿拉伯人民要走什么样的道路，才能取得反帝斗争的彻底胜利？每个身受帝国主义侵略、为自己民族解放而奋斗的阿拉伯人，都不能不去思索这些关系到自己民族命运的根本问题。
    现在，阿拉伯各国仍然处在民族民主革命的历史阶段。以美国为首的新殖民主义还骑在阿拉伯人民的头上。阿拉伯人民决不愿意看到自己的国土沦丧，决不愿意做新殖民主义的奴隶。他们在这次反侵略战争和当前的反美斗争中，已经表现出空前的觉醒。在广大的阿拉伯人民中间蕴藏的这种革命力量，是不可战胜的。广大的人民群众，首先是工人和农民，是阿拉伯各国民族民主革命的基本动力。
    阿拉伯国家的资产阶级，除了官僚买办阶级以外，具有两面性。他们受帝国主义的压迫，有同帝国主义矛盾的一面。他们在一定时期和一定程度上可以参加反对帝国主义的斗争。但是，由于他们在经济上和政治上的软弱性，又有其动摇妥协的一面。
    毛主席说：“处在今天的国际环境中，殖民地半殖民地的任何英雄好汉们，要就是站在帝国主义战线方面，变为世界反革命力量的一部分；要就是站在反帝国主义战线方面，变为世界革命力量的一部分。二者必居其一，其他的道路是没有的。”
    阿拉伯国家的执政的资产阶级面临着这样的抉择：如果坚持反对帝国主义的斗争，反对以美国为首的新殖民主义，维护民族独立，这样就会得到人民的支持；如果违背人民的意愿，不能坚持反对美帝国主义的斗争，不能抵抗苏联修正主义的欺骗和压力，那就不仅脱离人民，而且会被美帝和苏修搞掉，或者变成它们的附庸。
    毛主席在一九六一年四月二十八日接见阿拉伯和非洲朋友时，曾经指出：“对帝国主义进行斗争当中，采取正确的路线，依靠工人、农民，团结广大的革命知识分子、小资产阶级和反对帝国主义的民族资产阶级以及一切爱国反帝力量，紧紧地联系群众，就有可能取得胜利。”
    当前世界上是一片大好革命形势。阿拉伯地区的革命形势同样是大好的。阿拉伯无产阶级和革命人民只要采取正确的政策，团结一切可以团结的力量，联合世界各国人民，集中打击以美国为首的新殖民主义及其走狗，就一定能够把反帝革命事业推向新的胜利。
    阿拉伯反侵略战争，又一次向全世界证明了一个最重要的真理：一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民要达到自己的革命目的，实现自己的彻底解放，任何别的道路都是走不通的，唯一的出路，就是靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠毛主席的理论和政策。走毛泽东的道路，这就是结论。
    人民的革命事业从来不是直线发展的。革命的人民正是从许许多多的挫折和失败中，才能真正找到革命的真理和正确的道路。
    伟大的列宁曾经描写过俄国人民怎样在半个世纪内，经历多少艰难困苦，终于找到马克思主义这个唯一正确的革命理论，从而取得伟大十月革命的胜利。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出，中国人民也是在半个多世纪内，经历千辛万苦，曲折和失败，最后，找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目就起了变化了。
    现在，马克思列宁主义已经发展到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。我们正处在以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。世界各国人民有着更优越的条件，找到革命的真理，找到正确的道路。阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民，经过自己的斗争实践，其中包括无数的探索、试验、比较、挫折、失败的过程，一定能够学到和掌握毛泽东思想。这是把人民的革命斗争引向最后胜利的根本保证。
    阿拉伯人民只要团结起来，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，阿拉伯的天下就一定是阿拉伯人民的！
