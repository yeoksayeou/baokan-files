	New China News Agency, August 17th. The China-Japan Friendship Association today issued a statement strongly protesting the Japanese Sato government's obstruction of our delegation's visit to Japan. The statement pointed out that the Sato government blatantly sabotages friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, and the result will only be that they will lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet, ending in a shameful failure.

	The statement said that our China-Japan Friendship Association, at the invitation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters, was scheduled to visit Japan in late June for friendly exchanges. However, the Sato government delayed issuing entry visas to our delegation for two months, and now has decided to refuse entry to four members of the delegation, and has proposed various unreasonable conditions to restrict our delegation's friendly activities. In reality, this is a complete refusal of our delegation's visit to Japan. We express great indignation and strong protest against this.

	The statement pointed out that the Sato government's obstruction of our delegation's visit to Japan is another blatant exposure of its rampant anti-China stance. The statement said that recently, due to the failures of the U.S. imperialists' aggression in Vietnam and the flourishing armed struggles of the people in various countries in Southeast Asia, U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Asia is facing bankruptcy. On the other hand, the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought and our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution internationally has made the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists extremely frightened and enraged. Therefore, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries have launched a countercurrent of anti-China chorus. The Sato government, in order to meet the strategic needs of its American master, actively serves as the vanguard of anti-China actions, strengthens its reactionary policies of hostility towards China, and obstructs friendly exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The statement said that the Japanese revisionist group led by Miyamoto has actively colluded with the Sato government in the anti-China chorus, sabotaged our delegation's visit to Japan, and acted as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Sato government in their anti-China actions. The Miyamoto group's frenzied anti-China stance completely goes against the will and wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, and thoroughly betrays the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people.

	The statement emphasized that China-Japan friendship is the common wish of the peoples of the two countries and an irresistible great historical trend. Anyone who opposes this trend will be crushed to pieces. Whether it is the Sato government or the Miyamoto group, any anti-China actions by ghosts and monsters will not harm a single hair of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the Japanese people in their unyielding struggle against all enemies that sabotage China-Japan friendship, and will thoroughly smash any plot by the Sato government to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The statement said that we must warn the Sato government: by blatantly sabotaging friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, the result will only be that you will lift a rock only to drop it on your own feet, ending in a shameful outcome.

    中日友协强烈抗议佐藤政府阻挠我代表团访日
    谁反对中日人民友好必将粉身碎骨
    宫本集团勾结日本反动派疯狂反华彻底背叛日本人民革命事业
    新华社十七日讯　中日友好协会今天发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府阻挠我代表团访问日本。声明指出，佐藤政府明目张胆地破坏中日两国人民的友好往来，其结果，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，以可耻的失败告终。
    声明说，我中日友协应日中友协（正统）总部邀请，应于六月下旬到日本进行友好访问。但佐藤政府拖延发给我代表团入境签证达两个月之久，现在决定拒绝代表团四名成员入境，并提出限制我代表团进行友好活动的种种无理条件，实际上就是全面拒绝我代表团访问日本，对此，我们表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，佐藤政府阻挠我代表团访日是它猖狂反华的又一次大暴露。声明说，最近由于佐藤的主子美帝国主义侵略越南节节失败，东南亚各国人民革命武装斗争蓬勃发展，美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策正在面临破产。另一方面，毛泽东思想和我国无产阶级文化大革命在国际上的伟大影响，使美帝、苏修怕得要命、恨得要死。因此，帝、修、反掀起一股反华大合唱的逆流。佐藤政府为配合其美国主子的战略需要，积极充当反华的急先锋，加强敌视中国的反动政策，阻挠中日两国人民的友好往来和经济文化交流。
    声明说，日修宫本集团在反华大合唱中积极勾结佐藤政府，破坏我代表团访日，充当了美帝、苏修和佐藤政府的反华走卒。宫本集团疯狂反华，完全违背了日本广大人民的意志和愿望，彻底背叛了日本人民的革命事业。
    声明强调说，中日友好是两国人民的共同愿望，是不可阻挡的伟大历史潮流。谁反对这一潮流，谁就会被冲得粉身碎骨，不管是佐藤政府还是宫本集团，任何牛鬼蛇神的反华行径都损伤不了中日两国人民友谊的一根毫毛。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民坚决支持日本人民同一切破坏中日友好的敌人进行不懈的斗争，彻底粉碎佐藤政府破坏中日两国人民友谊的任何阴谋。
    声明说，我们要警告佐藤政府：你们这样明目张胆地破坏中日两国人民的友好往来，其结果，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，落个可耻的下场。
