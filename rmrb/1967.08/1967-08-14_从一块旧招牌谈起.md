Title: Starting with an Old Signboard

In 1956, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was achieved. At that time, the broad masses of workers at the Shanghai Yong'an Company, filled with intense class hatred, unanimously demanded the destruction of the "Yong'an Company" signboard. The words "Yong'an" symbolized the capitalist's wish for "permanent" and "safe" exploitation. With the capitalist's "permanence" and "safety," there would be no "permanence" and "safety" for the working class. This old signboard contained so much class bitterness and blood-stained hatred from our worker brothers!

During the preparatory period for joint state-private ownership, the broad masses of workers at Yong'an Company proposed changing this old signboard to "Joint State-Private Ownership Store No. X." This strong revolutionary call was, of course, strongly opposed by the capitalists. However, a small clique within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road completely sided with the capitalists, sharing the same heart and mind. They said, "Changing to a number (Store No. X) is too monotonous. Let's change to a new signboard, lest the capitalists be dissatisfied." They thus suppressed the revolutionary demands of the broad masses of workers and kept this old signboard as if it were a treasure.

In 1958, with the advent of the Great Leap Forward nationwide, the workers again raised the revolutionary demand to smash this old signboard. However, the small clique within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road loyally carried out the black directives of their master, the Khrushchev of China, and once again protected the bourgeoisie, preventing the workers from smashing the "Yong'an" stinking signboard.

In February 1957, shortly after the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has basically been completed, the bourgeoisie still exists, and class struggle has not ended." In April of the same year, the representative of the bourgeoisie within the Party—the Khrushchev of China—ran to Shanghai and brazenly declared: "Today's capitalists are new capitalists..." His agents in Shanghai immediately echoed: "After the joint ownership of enterprises and the determination of fixed interest, the situation of the bourgeoisie has undergone a qualitative change." They openly opposed Chairman Mao. They took the reactionary capitalists of the "Yong'an Company" as a living example of "red capitalists," not only praising them to the skies but also indulging them in every way. The capitalists in the company, seeing that the small clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road were protecting them in every way, became increasingly arrogant. The reactionary capitalists blatantly declared: "As long as my power is preserved, my original team is preserved, and the signboard is preserved, in the future, with just one phone call, everything will come back, and the Yong'an Company will be mine again!"

"With a golden cudgel, the Monkey King sweeps away the dust of the world." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of workers at Yong'an Company not only realized their long-cherished wish to smash the "Yong'an Company" old signboard that had been weighing on them for fifty years and replace it with the new signboard "Dongfanghong Department Store," but also further exposed the hideous faces of the bourgeois representatives within the Party and smashed their evil plot of advocating class capitulationism and restoring capitalism!

We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," wield the golden cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, pursue and attack the "falling dogs," thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Khrushchev of China and his agents in Shanghai, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color!

    从一块旧招牌谈起
    一九五六年，在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，实现了对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。当时的上海永安公司广大职工，怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，一致要求砸掉“永安公司”这块旧招牌。“永安”这两个字，标志着资本家妄想“永久”地“平安”地剥削下去。有了资本家的“永久”和“平安”，就不会有工人阶级的“永久”和“平安”。这块旧招牌包含着我们职工兄弟多少阶级苦和血泪仇啊！
    当时，永安公司的广大职工在合营筹备时期，就提出要把这块旧招牌改为“公私合营第×商店”。这一强烈的革命呼声，资本家当然是竭力反对的。可是，旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派竟完全和资本家一副面孔，一个心肠，胡说什么：“改为数字（第×商店）太单调，换新招牌吧，怕资本家不满意。”他们就这样压制广大职工的革命要求，把这块旧招牌象宝贝一样地保留下来了。
    一九五八年，全国出现大跃进的革命形势，职工们又提出了砸掉这块旧招牌的革命要求。但是，旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派忠实地执行他们的主子、中国的赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，再一次保护了资产阶级，不让职工砸掉“永安”这块臭招牌。
    一九五七年二月，毛主席在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮后不久，就英明地指出：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成”，但是，“资产阶级还是存在”，“阶级斗争并没有结束”。同年四月，资产阶级在党内的总代表——中国的赫鲁晓夫却跑到上海，猖狂地胡说：“今天的资本家是新的资本家了……。”他在上海的代理人也马上跟着叫嚷：“企业合营以及定息确定以后，资产阶级的情况就有了质的变化。”公然和毛主席唱对台戏。他们把“永安公司”的反动资本家当作“红色资本家”的活样板，不仅为他竭力吹捧，简直对他百依百顺。公司里的资本家看到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对他们百般庇护，反动气焰越来越嚣张。反动资本家露骨地叫嚣：“只要我的权保好，原班人马保好，牌子保好，将来只要一个电话，东西统统会来，永安公司又是我的了！”
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，永安公司广大职工不仅实现了多年来的愿望，砸掉了压在自己身上五十年来的“永安公司”旧招牌，换上了“东方红百货商店”新招牌，而且进一步揭露了党内一小撮资产阶级代表人物的狰狞嘴脸，粉碎了他们推行阶级投降主义、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋！
    我们一定要牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，穷追猛打“落水狗”，彻底肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人散布的毒素，确保我国的社会主义江山永不变色！
