The mountains are cheering, the seas are singing. Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao has issued a great call to the People's Liberation Army: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is the greatest care, the greatest trust, and the greatest encouragement for the People's Liberation Army. This is the greatest support, the greatest protection, and the greatest inspiration for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country.

The People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad revolutionary masses, standing firmly and clearly, wholeheartedly supporting, helping, and protecting the revolutionary leftist organizations. At every critical turning point, the People's Liberation Army has stepped forward, steadfastly standing on the side of the revolutionary leftists, smashing the repeated frenzied counterattacks by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and leading the Cultural Revolution in Guilin from victory to new victories.

In the great criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary masses, the Red Guards, and the People's Liberation Army in Guilin have established an unbreakable combat friendship. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "relying on and trusting the People's Liberation Army," cherishing the People's Liberation Army as we cherish our own eyes, working closely with the People's Liberation Army, and together making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better.

    永远和解放军团结战斗在一起
    山在欢呼，海在歌唱，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志向人民解放军发出伟大号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”这是对人民解放军最大的关怀，最大的信赖，最大的鼓励。这是对全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的最大支持，最大爱护，最大鼓舞。
    人民解放军无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们响应毛主席人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，满腔热情地支持、帮助、保护革命左派组织。在每个紧急的转折关头，解放军都挺身而出，坚定不移地站在革命左派一边，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一次又一次的猖狂反扑，使桂林市的文化大革命从胜利走向新的胜利。
    在对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判中，我们桂林无产阶级革命派，红卫兵小将和解放军建立了牢不可破的战斗友谊。我们坚决按照毛主席的“相信和依靠人民解放军”的伟大教导，象爱护自己的眼睛一样，爱护人民解放军，同人民解放军密切合作，共同把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。　（广西《新桂林报》）
