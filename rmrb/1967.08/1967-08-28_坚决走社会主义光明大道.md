After liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our Sanjia Pu Brigade followed Chairman Mao's instructions and took the path of cooperativization and communalization. The more we worked, the more enthusiastic we became, with production increasing year by year and living standards improving year by year. However, when the "three autonomies and one contract" black wind blew into our brigade, it really harmed us.

In 1962, the capitalist-roaders in power within the county, following the black directives of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, wanted us to implement "three autonomies and one contract." They insisted that our place had scattered residences and fragmented land, making it inconvenient for the collective to farm and unable to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, thus unable to produce more grain. At that time, we poor and lower-middle peasants did not want to do it. But they forced us to do it. I thought, Chairman Mao told us to take the path of collectivization. He has never forgotten us poor and lower-middle peasants. Today, who is coming up with this bad idea to push us out? I figured there must be something fishy. Later, I was forced to contract two mu of land. It was like a lone sheep falling into a bottomless pit. In the first year of contracting, I fell ill. There was no one at home to take care of things, and weeds grew in the fields. By autumn, I could only harvest stalks and grains together. The second year, I suffered another disaster, and by autumn, there was nothing to harvest. It was at this time that the production team saved me, providing me with grain and treating my illness. It was truly "three autonomies and one contract" that almost killed me, but the collective saved me. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership! Father and mother are not as kind as Chairman Mao!

I kept this account in my heart. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I learned that the one advocating "three autonomies and one contract" was none other than the top capitalist-roader within the Party, this big villain. No wonder, after implementing "three autonomies and one contract," the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists became rampant, openly sabotaging collective production, engaging in large-scale land reclamation and speculative activities. Some well-off middle peasants also wanted to get rich, destroying forests and reclaiming land, causing severe soil erosion. If we had followed the capitalist-roader's directives, in a few years, we would have returned to the bitter days of the old society.

China's Khrushchev committed heinous crimes in the countryside, and now it is time to settle accounts! We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao's words and resolutely follow the bright path of socialism! We will take up our pens as swords and spears, launch a great criticism, thoroughly purge the poison of "three autonomies and one contract," and defend our proletarian iron kingdom.

    坚决走社会主义光明大道
    辽宁省海城县接文公社三家卜大队老贫农　刘德林
    解放以后，我们三家卜大队广大贫下中农按照毛主席的指示，走合作化、公社化的道路，越干劲越足，生产一年比一年高，生活一年比一年好。可是，“三自一包”的黑风刮到我们大队以后，可把我们坑苦了。
    一九六二年县里的党内走资本主义道路当权派，按照党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的黑指示，要我们这里搞“三自一包”。硬说我们这个地方居住分散，土地零星，不搞“包产到户”，集体不便耕种，不能调动大伙的积极性，也就不能多打粮食。当时，我们贫下中农都不愿意干。可是他们非逼着我们干不可。我心里想，毛主席叫我们走集体化的道路，他老人家啥时候也没忘记过咱贫下中农，今天是谁出的馊主意往外甩我们呢？我合计这里准有鬼。后来，我被迫包了二亩地，好象离群的小羊掉到没底的深坑里。包产的头一年，我就得了病，家里没人侍弄，地里草苗一齐长，到秋天连秆带粒扛了一扛。第二年又遭了灾，秋后颗粒没收。就在这个时候，生产队救了我，给我送来了口粮，替我治好了病。真是“三自一包”害的我要死，集体又把我救活了。这都是毛主席领导的好啊！爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！
    这笔账，我一直闷在心里。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我才知道，主张“三自一包”的不是别人，正是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，正是这个大坏蛋搞的鬼。怪不得搞了“三自一包”，地富反坏右分子猖狂起来了，他们公开破坏集体生产，大搞开荒和投机倒把活动。一些富裕中农也一心想发家致富，毁林开荒，破坏山场，使水土大量流失。如果按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所说的那样干下去，那么要不了几年，我们就又要回到旧社会那样的苦日子去了。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在农村犯下了滔天罪行，现在是清算的时候了！咱贫下中农听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义光明大道！我们要拿起笔，作刀枪，开展大批判，彻底肃清“三自一包”的流毒，保住我们无产阶级的铁打江山。
