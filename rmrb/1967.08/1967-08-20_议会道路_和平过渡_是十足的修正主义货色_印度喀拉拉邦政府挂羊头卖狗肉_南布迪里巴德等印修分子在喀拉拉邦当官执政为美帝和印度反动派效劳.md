The parliamentary road and peaceful transition are pure revisionist goods. The government of Kerala State in India is selling dog meat under the guise of lamb. The revisionists such as Nambudiripad in Kerala State are serving the U.S. imperialists and the Indian reactionaries while in office.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, our correspondent's commentary: The revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India, such as Nambudiripad, after becoming government officials in Kerala State, faithfully execute the treacherous and reactionary policies of the Indian National Congress Central Government. The current Kerala State government is still a part of the state machine of the Indian landlords and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie.

The revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India strongly oppose the armed struggle of the peasants and dream of entering the reactionary government through elections to become officials. They once organized a government in Kerala State from 1957 to 1959. This year, after the "Fourth General Election" in March, the revisionist elements of the Communist Party of India, together with the traitorous Dange group and other reactionary parties, formed the so-called "second Communist Party government" in Kerala State. Nambudiripad again took up the post of Chief Minister, continuing to stubbornly push the revisionist line of "peaceful transition."

Defending the interests of the exploiting classes

Since the new government of Kerala State took office, the production relations in the state, like those in other parts of India, remain unchanged. The broad masses of workers and peasants continue to suffer from the cruel exploitation of capitalists and landlords, living in misery. The state government represents and defends the interests of the exploiting classes.

It can be seen from the reports in Indian newspapers that the policies executed by Nambudiripad and others are completely those of the reactionary Indian Central Government. They do not hide this fact themselves.

This state government defends the interests of domestic monopolistic capital. According to reports, Nambudiripad had breakfast with one of India's biggest vampires, the tycoon Birla, on April 12. After this meal, Birla agreed to invest in mining and establish a glass factory in Kerala State. Nambudiripad promised favorable conditions, allowing Birla to establish another artificial silk factory in Kerala State.

Later, Nambudiripad said at a press conference regarding Kerala State's policy towards capitalist enterprises: "After all, we are only a state government.... Our government has to execute the same policies formulated by the Indian (Central) Government." It is clear that this is a reactionary policy of vigorously protecting the interests of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and intensifying the exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of laboring people.

This state government defends the interests of foreign monopolistic capital. Some unions in the state demanded the nationalization of foreign plantations within the state, but the state government's Minister of Industry (a member of the Dange group) rejected this on May 12. He declared that the state government could only execute the industrial policies of the Central Government.

Not only that, this state government also wants to attract more foreign investment, helping foreign capitalists to exploit the blood and sweat of the Indian people. The Minister of Industry of the state government announced that he would go to Japan in August to try to collaborate with Japanese monopolistic capitalists to establish industrial enterprises within the state.

Colluding with the U.S. imperialists

This state government is colluding with U.S. imperialism. The Minister of Food of the Nambudiripad group's state government shamelessly announced at a public meeting on May 14 that an American had offered to sell rice to Kerala State, and this rice is good, "therefore I want to obtain this batch of rice, even though it is provided by the Americans who are bombing Vietnam."

Nambudiripad himself also acts as a defender and protector of the international spies of U.S. imperialism. Although everyone knows that the American "Peace Corps" is operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, he denied on March 27 in the state assembly that the American "Peace Corps" members in Kerala State were engaged in espionage activities. In his view, these American spies "are providing technical assistance in the development of industry, health, animal husbandry, and education." He also said that his state government neither could nor would investigate whether the American "Peace Corps" had connections with the Central Intelligence Agency. When asked whether he would expel the American "Peace Corps," he said: "This is a policy issue that needs to be decided by the Federal (Central) Government."

This state government has executed the fascist tyranny of the Indian Central Government. Nambudiripad ordered the police to suppress the peasants' struggle for land. The Minister of Industry of the state government did not allow workers to take the just action of besieging capitalists and sent the police to suppress the workers' struggle.

The government of Kerala State has executed the extremely reactionary and treacherous policies of the Indian Central Government and, like the Indian Central Government, cannot solve the people's livelihood problems. The food shortage in Kerala State is very serious. The broad masses of people demand a fundamental change in land ownership, a genuine land reform, and the liberation of productive forces. However, Nambudiripad's solution to the food problem is to beg from the Indian Central Government. He had gone to New Delhi twice, at the end of March and the end of May, to report the emergency, actually holding a begging bowl to beg for food from the Indian landlords and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie.

Covering up for the Indian National Congress

Nambudiripad also covers up for the big bureaucrats of the extremely reactionary Indian National Congress Central Government, helping them to deceive the people. He had said that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Deputy Prime Minister Desai, Minister of Defense Chavan, and others "indeed realize that the country has changed, the old way of the Indian National Congress ruling all of India has gone forever. This realization will have a healthy influence and make them face the facts." He also flattered the recently deposed Governor of Kerala State, the Indian National Congress member Bhagwan Sahai, as "a model friend, a philosopher, a leader."

Nambudiripad not only fervently walks the parliamentary road himself but also believes that the planning work of the Indian Central Government, as long as it has "more progressive content," can "gradually lead the country to a socialist goal." This revisionist fallacy is actually the old revisionist Kautsky's junk, who said: "To make (the bourgeois) political machine more perfect, rather than to recreate it."

The materials reported in Indian newspapers are sufficient to show that the Kerala State government established within the scope of bourgeois "parliamentary democracy" is absolutely not a "people's government." Without thoroughly smashing the old state machine of the landlord bourgeoisie, it is impossible to talk about any people's power. The "model of peaceful transition" that Nambudiripad and his ilk plan to promote to the whole of India is an unadulterated tool of the dictatorship of landlords and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie.

Exposed and increasingly isolated

Nambudiripad and others, by pushing the revisionist line, betraying the revolutionary cause of the Indian people, have met with the resolute opposition of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and the revolutionary masses. In February, someone publicly denounced Nambudiripad in the capital of Kerala State for "engaging in revisionist and anti-people activities." In late July, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and the masses in the state broke through the suppression of Nambudiripad and others, launching a large-scale anti-hunger struggle. In addition, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India in the state actively propagandized the great thought of Mao Zedong and the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong thought views on the Indian revolution. They also published periodicals, publishing translations of articles from Beijing's "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." All of these exposed and struck at Nambudiripad and other revisionist elements, making them increasingly isolated and exposed.

### “议会道路”“和平过渡”是十足的修正主义货色  印度喀拉拉邦政府挂羊头卖狗肉  南布迪里巴德等印修分子在喀拉拉邦当官执政为美帝和印度反动派效劳

    “议会道路”“和平过渡”是十足的修正主义货色
    印度喀拉拉邦政府挂羊头卖狗肉
    南布迪里巴德等印修分子在喀拉拉邦当官执政为美帝和印度反动派效劳
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：印共修正主义分子南布迪里巴德等人，在喀拉拉邦当上政府官员以后，忠实执行印度国大党中央政府的卖国反动政策。现任喀拉拉邦政府照旧是印度地主和官僚买办资产阶级的国家机器的一个组成部分。
    印共修正主义分子极力反对农民武装斗争，整天梦想通过选举到反动政府里去做官。他们在一九五七年到一九五九年，曾经一度在喀拉拉邦组织过政府。今年三月，印度“第四届大选”后，印共修正主义分子又伙同叛徒丹吉集团等反动政党，在喀拉拉邦组成了所谓“第二个共产党政府”，南布迪里巴德再次担任首席部长，继续顽固地推行“和平过渡”的修正主义路线。
    维护剥削阶级利益
    喀拉拉邦新政府上台以来，邦内的生产关系同印度其它所有地方一样，原封未动。广大工人、农民继续受着资本家和地主的残酷剥削，生活在水深火热之中。邦政府所代表和维护的是剥削阶级的利益。
    仅仅从印度报刊的报道中就可以看出，南布迪里巴德等人所执行的完全是印度中央政府的反动政策。他们自己也并不讳言。
    这个邦政府维护本国垄断资本的利益。据报道，南布迪里巴德在四月十二日同印度最大的吸血鬼之一、大财阀比拉坐在一起共进早餐。这顿饭吃过，比拉就答应在喀拉拉邦投资开矿和设立一座玻璃工厂。南布迪里巴德答应给予比拉优惠的条件，让他在喀拉拉邦再设立一座人造丝厂。
    随后，南布迪里巴德在记者招待会谈到喀拉拉邦对资本主义企业的政策时说：“我们毕竟只是一个邦政府。……我们的政府不得不执行印度（中央）政府所制订的同样的政策。”很明显，这就是竭力保护帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的利益，加紧剥削和压迫广大劳动人民的反动政策。
    这个邦政府维护外国垄断资本的利益。邦内的某些工会要求把邦内的外国种植园收归国有，但是，邦政府的工业部长（丹吉集团分子）在五月十二日发表谈话加以拒绝。他宣称，邦政府只能执行中央政府的工业政策。
    不仅如此，这个邦政府还要吸收更多的外国投资，帮助外国资本家榨取印度人民的血汗。邦政府工业部长宣布，他将在八月间到日本去，设法同日本垄断资本家合伙，在邦内开办工业企业。
    同美帝勾勾搭搭
    这个邦政府同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭。南布迪里巴德集团的邦政府粮食部长五月十四日在一次公共集会上厚颜无耻地宣布，一名美国人表示愿意向喀拉拉邦出售大米，这种大米很好，“因此我愿意得到这批大米，尽管它是轰炸越南的美国提供的。”
    南布迪里巴德本人也替美帝国主义的国际特务充当辩护士和保护人。尽管谁都知道美国“和平队”是美国特务机关中央情报局操纵的，但是，三月二十七日他在邦议会上矢口否认在喀拉拉邦的美国“和平队”队员从事间谍活动。在他看来，这些美国特务“是在对工业、卫生、畜牧业和教育方面的发展工作，提供技术上的帮助”。他又说，他的邦政府既没有也不能去调查美国“和平队”是否同美国中央情报局有联系。当议员问他是否要把美国“和平队”赶走的时候，他说：“这是一个需要由联邦（中央）政府决定的政策性问题。”
    这个邦政府执行了印度中央政府的法西斯暴政。南布迪里巴德下令派警察部队去镇压农民的夺地斗争。邦政府工业部长不许工人采取围困资本家的正义行动，并且派警察去镇压工人的斗争。
    喀拉拉邦政府执行了极端反动卖国的印度中央政府的各项政策，它同印度中央政府一样，根本不可能解决人民的生活问题。喀拉拉邦内的粮荒非常严重。广大人民要求从根本上改变土地所有制，实行真正的土地改革，解放生产力。但是，南布迪里巴德解决吃饭问题的办法，是向印度中央政府乞讨。他曾在三月底和五月底两次跑到新德里去告急，实际上是捧着个讨饭碗，向印度地主和官僚买办资产阶级讨饭。
    为国大党涂脂抹粉
    南布迪里巴德还替反动透顶的国大党中央政府的大官僚涂脂抹粉，帮助他们欺骗人民。他曾说什么总理英迪拉·甘地、副总理德赛、国防部长恰范等人“确实认识到国内已经变了样，国大党统治整个印度的老样子，已经一去不复返了。这种认识将产生健康的影响，并使他们面对事实”。他还十分肉麻地吹捧刚刚下台的喀拉拉邦邦长、国大党人巴格万·萨海是“一个模范的朋友、一个哲学家、一个领路人”。
    南布迪里巴德不仅自己狂热地走议会道路，而且认为，印度中央政府的计划工作只要具有“更加进步的内容”，就能“逐步把国家引向一个社会主义的目标”。这种修正主义谬论，实际上就是老修正主义者考茨基的破烂货色，考茨基说过：“要使（资产阶级的）政治机器趋于完善，而不是要重新来创造它”。
    印度报刊上报道的这些材料足以说明，在资产阶级“议会民主”范围内建立起来的喀拉拉邦政府，绝不是什么“人民政府”。不彻底打碎地主资产阶级旧的国家机器，就根本谈不上有什么人民的政权。南布迪里巴德之流打算向印度全国推广的这种“和平过渡的典范”，是不折不扣的地主和官僚买办资产阶级的专政工具。
    原形毕露，日益孤立
    南布迪里巴德等人推行修正主义路线，叛卖印度人民的革命事业，受到了印共革命派和革命群众的坚决反对。今年二月间，有人在喀拉拉邦首府公开谴责南布迪里巴德“进行修正主义的和反人民的活动”。七月下旬，邦内印共革命派和群众冲破南布迪里巴德等人的压制，掀起了大规模的反饥饿斗争。此外，邦内的印共革命派积极宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，宣传关于印度革命的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的观点。他们还出版刊物，发表北京《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》文章的译文。所有这些，都揭露和打击了南布迪里巴德等修正主义分子，使他们日益孤立，原形毕露。
