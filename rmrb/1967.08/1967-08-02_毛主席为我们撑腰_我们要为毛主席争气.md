Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued a letter to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers in Wuhan. The good news spread, and Wuhan's three towns and both banks of the Yangtze River were in a state of excitement. Revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers were all excited and joyful, shouting with all their hearts. This is the voice of Chairman Mao, the voice of the Party Central Committee. It is like a spring thunder, shaking the land of Wuhan, greatly encouraging the revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region to enter a new battle with even more heroic posture.

This letter deeply analyzes the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region and clearly points out the direction and tasks of the future struggle. It is the action guide for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan region and the new battle order issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us.

This letter brings immense encouragement and strength to the booming Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region. It embodies Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's deepest concern, most resolute support, and most powerful leadership for the revolutionary mass organizations such as "Workers' General Headquarters," "Second Headquarters," "August 13th," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," "Three Headquarters Revolutionary Alliance," and the broad revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region. It is a fatal blow to China's Khrushchev and his agents and a handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" and "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region is entering a new stage of victory.

At this serious moment when a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan region, and a small handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" and "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" have launched a reactionary countercurrent of openly opposing the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has always firmly supported the broad revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region. With wise decisions, he launched a powerful political offensive, smashing the arrogant attacks of a small handful of class enemies. At this time when the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region is approaching, Beijing has sent a letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers in Wuhan, pointing out the direction and path for our victorious advance.

Chairman Mao supports the proletarian revolutionary masses, and the proletarian revolutionary masses must make Chairman Mao proud!

We firmly believe that the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region will, in the struggle, unswervingly and without any compromise, carry out the series of instructions proposed in the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers in Wuhan. They will firmly grasp the overall direction, concentrating the spearhead of the struggle on China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region; they will be vigilant against troublemakers and not allow them to disrupt social order. They will persistently strengthen the unity within the proletarian revolutionary masses, overcome the non-proletarian thoughts of sectarianism, factionalism, and individualism within their own ranks, and achieve a solid revolutionary great alliance. They will patiently do work among the masses who have been deceived by the "Million Heroes" and "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts," making them turn around and strike back; for cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they do not persist in their mistakes and sincerely correct them, and after being forgiven by the broad masses, they can still stand up and join the revolutionary ranks. They will hold high the great banner of "Support the Army and Love the People," closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and jointly fight against the enemy.

We firmly believe that the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support and defend the broad leftist masses, fight together with them, and win together with them.

The serious political incident in Wuhan is a vivid class education for the revolutionary masses across the country and a profound education on the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois lines. It will widely mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country, encouraging the proletarian revolutionary masses across the country to launch a great criticism, exposing, criticizing, overthrowing, and denouncing the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party from a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint, and thoroughly carrying out this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛主席为我们撑腰　我们要为毛主席争气
    最近，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组发表了给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信。喜讯传来，武汉三镇，长江两岸，一片沸腾。革命群众和广大指战员无不兴奋激动，纵情欢呼。这是毛主席的声音，党中央的声音。它象一声春雷，震动了武汉的大地，极大地鼓舞着武汉地区广大革命群众和人民解放军的指战员，以更加高昂的英雄姿态，投入新的战斗。
    这封信，深刻地分析了武汉地区当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势，明确地指出了今后斗争的方向和任务。它是武汉地区无产阶级革命派的行动指南，是毛主席和党中央向我们发出的新的战斗号令。
    这封信，给正在蓬勃发展的武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，带来了无比巨大的鼓舞和力量。它体现了毛主席和党中央对武汉地区“工总”、“二司”、“九一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命群众组织和广大革命群众最深切的关怀，最坚决的支持，最有力的领导。它是对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人和“百万雄师”、“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头的致命打击。
    武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，正在出现着一个新的胜利阶段。
    在武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”、“公检法”中的一小撮坏头头掀起一股公开对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，对抗无产阶级文化大革命的反动逆流的严重时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席始终坚决地支持武汉地区的广大革命群众，以英明的决策，发动了强大的政治攻势，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的狂妄进攻。在武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命胜利形势到来的时候，北京又传来了毛主席、党中央给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信，为我们指明了胜利前进的方向和道路。
    毛主席为无产阶级革命派撑腰，无产阶级革命派一定要为毛主席争气！
    我们坚信，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派一定会在斗争中，坚定不移、不折不扣地执行中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的信中提出的一系列指示。一定会紧紧掌握大方向，把斗争的矛头集中地指向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人；要警惕坏人捣乱，不许他们破坏社会秩序。一定会坚持不懈地加强无产阶级革命派内部的团结，克服自己队伍中的小团体主义、宗派主义和个人主义等非无产阶级思想，实现巩固的革命的大联合。一定会耐心地向“百万雄师”、“公检法”中受蒙蔽的群众做工作，使他们转变过来，反戈一击；对于犯错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大群众所谅解之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。一定会更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，和人民解放军紧密合作，共同对敌。
    我们坚信，人民解放军广大指战员，一定会继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持和保卫左派广大群众，同他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    武汉发生的严重政治事件，对全国革命群众，是一次生动的阶级教育，是一次深刻的无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线斗争的教育。它必将广泛地动员全国人民的革命积极性，鼓舞全国无产阶级革命派投入革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭深、批透、斗倒、斗臭，把这一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
