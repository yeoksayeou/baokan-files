Under the radiant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the warm care of Vice Chairman Lin, the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Garrison Troops concluded successfully.

The conference, held from August 3 to 12, was a grand review and summary of the entire garrison's efforts in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It marked a new stage in the garrison's mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers are determined to continue holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to accomplish the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" to the benefit of the people.

At the closing ceremony on August 12, the representatives, filled with boundless love, admiration, respect, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, unanimously adopted a message of tribute to Chairman Mao. The message stated: "Dear Chairman Mao, you have taught us: 'All revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it.' We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, firmly grasp our rifles, and wield our pens to defend the socialist mountains and rivers forever. We, the guards, pledge to you: we will defend you to the death, we will defend your close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin to the death, we will defend your proletarian headquarters to the death, and we will defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death! Whoever opposes you, whoever opposes Vice Chairman Lin, whoever opposes your proletarian headquarters, whoever opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will resolutely overthrow them! We must strengthen our preparedness and be ready at any time to defend socialist motherland and support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world to smash the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs! Wherever you point, we will strike! We dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea! We will forever and ever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance courageously along the revolutionary course you have blazed!"

During the conference, the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin inscribed the words: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is the greatest care, encouragement, and spur for the conference; it is the order to mobilize and the battle cry to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

During the conference, leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other departments, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, and Jiang Qing, received the representatives.

Chen Boda, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, delivered a speech at the conference.

Over the past year, the troops of the Beijing Garrison have made significant contributions in defending Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing, the birthplace of the revolution, and in carrying out the tasks of "three supports, two militaries." They have produced a large number of advanced collectives and individuals in studying Chairman Mao's works. Among the more than 500 representatives attending the conference, there are commanders and soldiers who have excelled in their duties of guarding and applying Chairman Mao's works; there are advanced units and outstanding individuals who have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the leftist masses, raised the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and fought alongside the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary masses' organizations in the front lines of "three supports, two militaries."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the troops of the Beijing Garrison have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school. They have actively implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to raise the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The movement has seen new developments and a new situation.

At the conference, the representatives shared their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past year. Their experiences emphasized using the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, elevating the transformation of one's worldview to the level of the struggle between the two lines, learning and applying in the struggle, and ensuring that the troops are truly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the new stage of socialist revolution.

In the intense struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to be truly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they deeply felt that the primary task is to study Chairman Mao's theories and practices on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, continuously deepening their class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and practices in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, combined with the great exposure and criticism of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, making the broad ranks of officers and soldiers recognize who is our most dangerous enemy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, how to overthrow this most dangerous enemy, and ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers remain unchanged forever; recognize that Chairman Mao has solved a series of contemporary proletarian revolutionary problems in theory and practice, solved the most fundamental problem of how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration in the socialist period; and thus further recognize Chairman Mao's great wisdom and greatness, continuously deepening their class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They also repeatedly studied the great revolutionary practices of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and his profound and comprehensive exposition of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, elevating their love for Chairman Mao and their feelings for Mao Zedong Thought to a new height.

They believed that to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break with the self, and thoroughly transform one's worldview. They felt that breaking with the self and establishing the public must focus on the big issues. In the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, one must consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. This is the most important issue, the greatest public cause. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," linking their personal thoughts and work with state affairs and political alignment, thereby placing themselves in the struggle between the two lines, elevating their words and deeds to the level of the struggle between the two lines, and elevating the breaking with the self and establishing the public to a new level.

They believed that to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great classroom of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, actively going through the great winds and waves of the mass movement to be tempered. They believed that in the decisive moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the struggle is even more intense, the situation is even more complex, and every day they encounter many directional, line, and policy issues. In this great storm of class struggle, learning and applying in this great storm of class struggle can most deeply touch one's soul, most test, educate, and transform one, most deepen the understanding and implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and most test the effectiveness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The conference also seriously discussed the plans and measures to implement Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions. The representatives expressed: They must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," and strive for greater progress, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下和林副主席的亲切关怀下
    北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会胜利闭幕
    广大指战员决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在保卫毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，胜利完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务中，为人民大立新功。
    新华社十三日讯　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的亲切关怀下，中国人民解放军北京卫戍区从八月三日到十二日召开了学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。这次大会是对全体指战员在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作的一次大检阅、大总结，是个成功的大会，胜利的大会。这次大会进一步把卫戍区学习毛主席著作群众运动推向了新阶段。广大指战员决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，胜利完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务中，为人民大立新功。
    在十二日的闭幕大会上，代表们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限敬仰、无限忠诚的心情，一致通过了给毛主席的致敬信。信中说：敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们一定要百倍地提高革命警惕，紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，保卫社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。我们警卫战士向您宣誓：誓死保卫您，誓死保卫您的亲密战友林副主席，誓死保卫您的无产阶级司令部，誓死保卫中央文革！谁反对您，谁反对林副主席，谁反对您的无产阶级司令部，谁反对中央文革，我们就坚决把他打倒！我们一定要加强战备，随时准备为保卫社会主义祖国，支援世界人民的革命斗争，粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略而战斗！您指到那里，我们就打到那里。刀山敢上，火海敢闯！我们永远永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着您开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
    会议期间，伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席给大会题了词：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”这是给大会的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策；是向部队发出的把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到一个新阶段的动员令、进军号。
    会议期间，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革和各方面的负责同志周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、李先念、谢富治、江青等接见了全体代表。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志到会讲了话。
    一年来，北京卫戍区部队在保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命策源地北京的战斗岗位上，在执行“三支”“两军”的任务中，作出了重大贡献，涌现出大批学习毛主席著作先进集体和先进人物。参加大会的五百多名代表中，有在执行警卫任务时，活学活用毛主席著作，作出优异成绩的指挥员、战斗员；有积极响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，在“三支”“两军”前线，与无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起的先进单位和优秀人物。
    北京卫戍区部队在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热烈地响应毛主席发出的“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，积极地贯彻执行了林副主席关于把学习毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段的指示，部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，有了新的发展，出现了新的局面。
    在大会上，代表们以自己的亲身经历，广泛而充分地交流了一年来活学活用毛主席著作的新经验。他们的经验集中到一点，就是要把无产阶级文化大革命运动作为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，把破私立公改造世界观提高到两条路线斗争的纲上来，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，使部队在社会主义革命新阶段，真正做到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，要做到无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，他们深深体会到，首要的是学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论和实践，不断加深对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无比深厚的阶级感情。他们遵照林副主席指示：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度，对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，反复学习毛主席在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法、政策，和毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大实践，结合对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大揭露、大批判，使广大指战员认识到在无产阶级专政条件下，谁是我们最危险的敌人，怎么样才能打倒这个最危险的敌人，保证社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色；认识到毛主席从理论和实践上解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，解决了在社会主义时期如何巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟这样一个最根本的问题；从而更加认识到毛主席无比英明，无比伟大，不断加深对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情。他们还反复学习了毛主席的亲密战友林副主席的伟大革命实践、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想所作的深刻全面的阐述，把对毛主席的热爱和对毛泽东思想的感情提高到一个新的高度。
    他们认为，要忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，一定要活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，彻底改造世界观。他们体会到破私立公要抓大节。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，自觉地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，这是最最重要的问题，这是革命的大节，是最大的“公”。他们学习毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，把个人的思想和工作同国家大事联系起来，同政治上站队联系起来，从而把自己摆到两条路线斗争中去，把自己的言行提高到两条路线斗争的纲上来，把破私立公提高到新的水平。
    他们认为，要忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，就要在无产阶级文化大革命的大课堂里，大学大用毛主席著作。毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”他们遵循毛主席的教导，积极到群众运动的大风大浪中“经风雨，见世面”，受锻炼。他们认为在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻，更加斗争激烈，更加情况复杂，每天都遇到许多方向性、路线性、政策性的问题，在这个阶级斗争的大风大浪中学，在这个阶级斗争的大风大浪中用，最能触及人的灵魂，最能考验人、教育人、改造人，最能加深理解和贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，最能检验活学活用毛主席著作效果。
    会上，还认真讨论了贯彻林副主席最新指示的计划和措施。代表们表示：一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，再接再厉，争取更大的进步，把学习毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切、改造一切、推动一切，在无产阶级文化大革命中大立新功。
