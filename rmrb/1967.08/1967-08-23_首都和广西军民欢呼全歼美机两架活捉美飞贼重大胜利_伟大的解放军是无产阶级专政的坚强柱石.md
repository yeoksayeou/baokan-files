The military and civilians of the capital and Guangxi are jubilant over the complete annihilation of two U.S. aircraft and the capture of a U.S. pilot, a major victory. The great People's Liberation Army is the steadfast pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 22, the military and civilians of the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the capital, amidst the triumphant songs of criticizing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and defeating them thoroughly, enthusiastically celebrated the great victory of our heroic air force in completely annihilating two U.S. A-6 attack aircraft and capturing one U.S. air pirate. The broad masses of military and civilians enthusiastically cheered, this is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

When this heartening news from the southern border of the motherland reached the capital, people immediately spread the word, and everywhere there was a chorus of cheers. The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed in Beijing, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres were all jubilant. Some immediately wrote large banners to congratulate our air force on their new achievements, some wrote big-character posters to denounce the new aggressive crimes of the U.S. aggressors. People shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" a thousand times, ten thousand times.

The soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison Command were in high spirits upon hearing this inspiring news. Liu Wenbin, the political instructor of a certain company that has been awarded the title of "Four Good" company for two consecutive years, excitedly said: "The heroes of the air force fought this battle decisively, fought it neatly, fought it beautifully! This is a new victory in implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of 'grasp revolution, promote preparedness for war.' It is a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and it is also a heavy blow to the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party! This fact once again eloquently proves: the greatest combat effectiveness is not aircraft, cannons, and atomic bombs, but the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of soldiers and officers expressed that as soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, they must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The news of victory spread to the factories of the capital, and the revolutionary workers celebrated en masse; it spread to the offices, and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres clapped their hands in joy; wherever the good news spread, it immediately presented a moving scene. In many colleges and universities, the broad revolutionary youngsters could not contain their joy. They cheered, jumped, sang, and wrote letters to radio stations and newspapers, expressing their boundless hatred for domestic and foreign class enemies and their determination to learn from the PLA. The Red Flag warriors of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics wrote in a letter titled "The People and the Army United as One, See Who Can Defeat Us": Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." We, the Red Flag warriors, resolutely stand together with the PLA, fight together, and win together.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 22 from Nanning, the joyous news of our heroic People's Liberation Army air force completely annihilating two U.S. aggressor aircraft and capturing one U.S. air pirate in a certain place in Guangxi yesterday spread throughout the cities and villages of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The broad revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the stationed troops were in high spirits, enthusiastically cheering that this is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses of Nanning City were elated upon hearing this joyous news, spreading the word and holding discussions to enthusiastically congratulate our heroic air force on this new great victory. The Red Guards denounced the war provocations of U.S. imperialism at the meeting. They pointed out that the People's Liberation Army armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is invincible in the world, unparalleled. If U.S. imperialism dares to continue its aggression, it will surely meet the same punishment as the U.S. air pirates who invaded on the 21st and were smashed to smithereens. The Red Guards said, this victory once again proves that the People's Liberation Army is the steadfast pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a reliable guarantee for us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will forever learn from and salute the heroic People's Liberation Army!

The news of victory reached the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's 6955 unit fighting on the "three-in-one" and "two supports" frontlines, and they were immensely elated. They, together with the local proletarian revolutionary masses, enthusiastically cheered the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, we warn U.S. imperialism: the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is invincible. You come with one, we will shoot down one; you come with a pair, we will shoot down a pair, we will not show mercy, and we will definitely make you suffer a crushing defeat.
