The ruthless Ne Win reactionary government recently dispatched troops to carry out a bloody suppression of the people who, unable to endure hunger, have risen up to seize rice.

According to a revelation by Ba Zaw, the deputy chairman of the Burmese Security and Administrative Committee, at a press conference on the 14th, five thousand Arakanese people (a Burmese ethnic minority) seized rice from a state-owned rice mill in Arakan City on the 13th. The government sent troops to carry out a bloody suppression, killing 18 people and injuring 49.

According to newspaper reports, the Arakanese people began seizing rice on the 12th. About five thousand people seized rice from a government ship docked at Arakan Port and then seized rice from a government rice mill. A total of one thousand bags of government rice were seized by the people.

On the 13th, the people seized rice from another state-owned rice mill. Despite the government troops' bloody suppression, the people did not yield.

The Ne Win reactionary government has now declared that the Arakan administrative region is under "military control" and has imposed martial law.

Ba Zaw also revealed two other incidents of people seizing rice at the press conference. He said that recently, people led by armed forces seized over five hundred bags of rice in Kawthaung Town, Bago District, and seized a trainload of rice in the Pandaung area, Pyinmana District.
