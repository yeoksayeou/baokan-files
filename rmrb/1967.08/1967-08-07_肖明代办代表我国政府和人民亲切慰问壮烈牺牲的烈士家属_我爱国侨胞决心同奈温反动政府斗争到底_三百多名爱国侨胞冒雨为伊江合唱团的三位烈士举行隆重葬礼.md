The Chinese Embassy in Burma's Chargé d'Affaires, Xiao Ming, and embassy staff, representing the Chinese government, the motherland, and all Chinese comrades working in Burma, visited the families of martyrs who were killed in the recent anti-China violence orchestrated by the Ne Win reactionary government on August 3. They also visited the injured Chinese residents at the Yangon General Hospital.

Xiao Ming and the embassy staff met with the mother of martyr Xie Zongyu. Xie Zongyu was one of the three heroes of the Chinese choir in Burma who sacrificed himself on June 27. Xie Zongyu's mother told the embassy staff that she was proud to have such a heroic son. The heroic mother said to the embassy comrades, "Before his martyrdom, Xie Zongyu studied Chairman Mao's works diligently and longed to return to the motherland. He had made all the preparations, but because he had to translate for Chinese experts assisting Burma, he did not realize his wish. She expressed extreme indignation at the brutal murder of her son by Burmese thugs."

The embassy staff also visited the families of the other two martyrs from the Chinese choir in Burma, Yang Rongzhao and Chen Chengshi. Yang Rongzhao's parents told the Chinese embassy staff, "Before his martyrdom, Yang Rongzhao swore, 'My head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned.' Yang Rongzhao and Chen Chengshi were both workers and active learners of Chairman Mao's works."

On June 27, these three heroes fought together against an attack by several hundred thugs led by the American Embassy in Burma. At that time, these three Chinese youths stood firm on the fourth floor, facing the fascist thugs armed with various deadly weapons. They fearlessly fought against the thugs for four hours, repelling dozens of attacks. In the fight, more than twenty thugs were killed or injured, and the Burmese fascist soldiers on the scene were also terrified. The defeated thugs then climbed onto the roof, poured gasoline, and set the building on fire. At this time, the three heroes were already injured, with bloodstains all over their clothes. They were surrounded by the flames. To maintain the dignity of the motherland, they decided to jump from the building together and sacrifice themselves for the country. They wrapped red cloths around their waists, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao," and jumped from the fourth floor. At that moment, the thugs howled like beasts and swarmed over, hacking them into pieces and throwing them into the fire.

The heroic deeds of the three good sons of the Chinese people show the world that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the heroic spirit to fight to the end with the enemy and never surrender.

The embassy staff also expressed condolences to the family of Chen Zuyin, a martyr from the Chinese Residents' Union. Chen Zuyin, along with two other elderly members of the Chinese Residents' Union, Shi Xuebing and Xiao Shicong, fought bravely alongside the three heroes of the Chinese choir on June 27 in a nearby building. These three elderly and weak individuals had repelled two attacks by the thugs but eventually sacrificed themselves due to being outnumbered. Chen Zuyin, Shi Xuebing, and Xiao Shicong were models of patriotic Chinese residents. They had worked day and night for the interests of patriotic Chinese residents in Burma. Chen Zuyin's children said they would learn from their father.

When the families of the martyrs heard that the Chinese embassy staff were expressing condolences on behalf of the Chinese government and the motherland, they were all moved to tears. They felt extremely happy and proud to have a great socialist motherland to rely on.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on August 6, more than 300 patriotic Chinese residents braved the heavy rain on the morning of August 6 to hold a solemn funeral for the three heroes of the Chinese choir, Yang Rongzhao, Xie Zongyu, and Chen Chengshi, who sacrificed themselves bravely in resisting the fascist violence of the Ne Win reactionary government on June 27.

The funeral was held at a cemetery in the suburbs of Yangon.

The Chinese Embassy in Burma's Chargé d'Affaires, Xiao Ming, embassy staff, Chinese experts in Burma, and the heroes' relatives attended the funeral. They laid wreaths and observed a moment of silence at the heroes' graves to express their deepest condolences.

Xiao Ming spoke at the heroes' graves. He said, "The three martyrs showed their boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the motherland in their struggle against fascist thugs. They proved to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and heroic sons of the motherland. They are excellent examples for all Chinese residents to learn from. Their noble qualities, demonstrated in defending Mao Zedong Thought and maintaining the dignity of the motherland, will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Burmese people."

Xiao Ming pointed out that the traditional deep friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is unbreakable. All anti-China elements will meet a bad end, and all reactionaries will eventually be overthrown by the people.

After Xiao Ming concluded his speech, the patriotic Chinese residents repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!"

    肖明代办代表我国政府和人民亲切慰问壮烈牺牲的烈士家属
    我爱国侨胞决心同奈温反动政府斗争到底
    三百多名爱国侨胞冒雨为伊江合唱团的三位烈士举行隆重葬礼
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明和大使馆人员代表中国政府、祖国人民和所有在缅甸工作的中国同志，三日慰问了在奈温反动政府最近策划的反华暴行中被杀害的烈士家属，并且再次到仰光综合医院探望了受伤华侨。
    肖明和大使馆人员会见了谢宗育烈士的母亲。谢宗育是六月二十七日壮烈牺牲的华侨伊江合唱团的三个英雄之一。谢宗育的母亲对大使馆人员说，她为有这样一个英雄的儿子而感到自豪。英雄的母亲对大使馆的同志们说，谢宗育在牺牲以前，努力学习毛主席著作，非常想回祖国，而且已经作好一切准备，只是因为要给援缅中国专家当翻译而没有实现他的愿望。她对缅甸暴徒残酷杀害她的儿子表示极为愤慨。
    大使馆人员还慰问了华侨伊江合唱团三名烈士中的另外两名烈士杨荣照和陈承世的家属。杨荣照的父母对中国大使馆的同志们说，杨荣照在牺牲以前曾发誓说：“我头可断、血可流，毛泽东思想永不丢。”杨荣照和陈承世都是工人，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
    在六月二十七日，这三位英雄一起抗击由美国驻缅甸大使馆豢养的爪牙率领下的几百名暴徒的袭击。当时，这三个华侨青年坚守在四楼上，面对着手持各种杀人凶器疯狂扑来的法西斯暴徒，面无惧色，同暴徒搏斗了四个小时，击退了暴徒几十次的攻击。在搏斗中，暴徒死伤二十多人，在场的缅甸法西斯军人也吓坏了。遭到惨败的暴徒随后爬上屋顶浇煤油，放火烧楼，这时，三位英雄已经受伤，衣服上血迹斑斑。他们被烈火包围了。为了维护祖国的尊严，他们决定一起跳楼，以身殉国。他们腰里裹着红布，高呼“毛主席万岁”，从四层楼上跳下来。这时，暴徒们象野兽一样嗥叫着，蜂涌而上，把他们砍成几段，扔到火里。
    中国人民的三个好儿子壮烈牺牲的事迹向全世界表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，有同敌人血战到底的英雄气概，宁死不屈。
    中国大使馆的人员也向华侨书记工会会员陈祖荫烈士的家属表示慰问。陈祖荫同华侨书记工会的另外两位老年人施学冰和肖士聪六月二十七日在邻近的楼房里同伊江合唱团的三位英雄并肩英勇自卫。这三位年迈体弱的老人曾经击退了暴徒的两次袭击，由于寡不敌众，壮烈牺牲。陈祖荫、施学冰和肖士聪是爱国华侨的模范。他们生前日日夜夜为在缅甸的爱国华侨的利益工作。陈祖荫的孩子们表示，他们要向爸爸学习。
    当烈士家属们听到中国大使馆人员代表中国政府和祖国人民向他们表示慰问的时候，他们都感动得热泪盈眶。他们为有伟大的社会主义祖国作靠山而感到无比幸福和自豪。
    据新华社六日讯　仰光消息：三百多位爱国华侨六日上午冒着倾盆大雨，在悲愤的气氛中为在六月二十七日在抵抗奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行中壮烈牺牲的伊江合唱团的三位英雄杨荣照、谢宗育和陈承世举行极其隆重的葬礼。
    葬礼在仰光郊区的一个公墓举行。
    中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明、大使馆工作人员、在缅甸的中国专家代表和英雄的生前亲友参加了葬礼。他们在英雄墓前献花圈、默哀，表示他们的最深切的哀悼。
    肖明在英雄们的墓前讲了话。他说，三位烈士在反抗法西斯暴徒的斗争中表现出他们对伟大领袖毛主席、对祖国的无限热爱和无限忠诚，证明了他们不愧是毛主席的好战士，是祖国的英雄儿子。他们是全体华侨学习的好榜样。他们为保卫毛泽东思想和为维护祖国的尊严所表现出来的崇高品质，将永远活在中国人民和缅甸人民的心中。
    肖明指出，中缅两国人民之间传统的深厚友谊是任何人也破坏不了的。一切反华的人决没有好下场，一切反动派迟早要被人民打倒。
    肖明结束讲话后，爱国华侨一再高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
