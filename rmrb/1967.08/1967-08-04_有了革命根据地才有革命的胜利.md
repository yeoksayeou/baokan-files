Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese revolution is in essence a peasant revolution," and "the War of Resistance Against Japan is in essence a peasant war." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our army, following Chairman Mao's instructions, raised the great banner of national liberation, advanced into the vast rural areas behind enemy lines, mobilized the people, organized the people, armed the people, and helped the people establish revolutionary governments. We carried out extensive guerrilla warfare in areas north and south of the Great Wall and along the Yangtze River, opening up and establishing one revolutionary base area after another. Each base area was like a steel dagger thrust into the enemy's heart, cutting the enemy piece by piece, gradually forming a situation where the countryside surrounded the cities, and ultimately seizing the cities. It was on the basis of these base areas that we defeated the Japanese aggressors and then defeated Chiang Kai-shek's eight million reactionary troops, achieving victory in the national revolution.

Chairman Mao's strategic thinking on relying on the peasants, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing political power through armed struggle, was fiercely opposed and viciously attacked by "Left" and Right opportunists within the Party. I remember that in the winter of 1945, when our troops had just entered Northeast China, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's great directive to "establish a solid Northeast base area." He opposed mobilizing the masses, opposed establishing base areas, and wanted to hand over the people's Northeast to the representatives of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, Chiang Kai-shek. Comrade Lin Biao, who consistently held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely resisted this opportunist line of error. Comrade Lin Biao resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, establishing rural revolutionary base areas. Our troops also dispersed into the vast rural areas, mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, carrying out land reform, and mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to the greatest extent. We rapidly changed the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, and in less than three years, liberated all of Northeast China.

Chairman Mao said: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." Establishing revolutionary base areas is the key to mobilizing, organizing, and arming the masses. With base areas, there are the masses; with base areas, there are people's armed forces, revolutionary governments, supplies, and guarantees of victory in war.

In 1942, it was the fifth year of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The enemy attempted to save its dying fate and launched one "mop-up" operation after another against our anti-Japanese guerrilla base areas. In this extremely difficult period, our troops relied on the broad masses of the people in the base areas to form a solid wall of steel. When the enemy launched "mop-up" operations, we responded with "counter-mop-up" operations. With the support and cooperation of the broad masses of the people in the base areas, our troops carried out extensive guerrilla warfare, appearing and disappearing like ghosts, striking the enemy. The masses in the base areas helped us escort prisoners, transport wounded soldiers, and supply military rations and ammunition; wherever our troops went, the masses arranged accommodation for us, stood guard, scouted enemy movements, and transmitted intelligence; the military and the people were united as one family. The enemy's boasted "mop-up" operations were all thoroughly defeated under the powerful blows of the liberated area's military and people.

People's war relies on the people. With base areas, there are the people; with base areas, people's armed forces and revolutionary governments can exist, develop, and grow stronger.

Today, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines throughout the world. The revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the peoples of Southeast Asia, are carrying out massive armed struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "Today's world revolution, in a certain sense, is also a situation of surrounding the cities from the countryside." The more revolutionary red base areas are established, the more the armed struggles of the world's revolutionary peoples develop, the sooner the day of U.S. imperialism's doom will come. We are firmly convinced that Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of establishing rural revolutionary base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside will definitely play an increasingly great role in the revolutionary struggles of the world; imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries will ultimately be drowned in the ocean of people's wars.

    有了革命根据地才有革命的胜利
    空军某部师长  魏钟锦
    毛主席指出：“中国的革命实质上是农民革命”，“抗日战争，实质上就是农民战争。”抗日战争时期，我军遵照毛主席的教导，高举民族解放的伟大旗帜，挺进到敌人后方的广大农村，动员人民，组织人民，武装人民，帮助人民建立革命政权，开展广泛的游击战争，在长城内外，大江南北，开辟和建立了一个又一个的革命根据地。每一块根据地都是插进敌人胸膛的一把钢刀，把敌人一刀一刀的割掉，逐步形成了以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的局面。我们正是依靠着这些根据地作为基础，打败了日本侵略者，又打败了蒋介石八百万反动军队，夺取了全国革命的胜利。
    毛主席关于依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的战略思想，曾经受到党内“左”、右倾机会主义者的拚命反对和猖狂攻击。记得在一九四五年冬，我们部队刚刚进入东北，当时反革命修正主义分子彭真就顽固地对抗毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”的伟大指示。他反对放手发动群众，不要根据地，要把人民的东北交给大地主大资产阶级的代表蒋介石。一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志，坚决抵制了这条机会主义的错误路线。林彪同志坚决执行毛主席的指示，建立了农村革命根据地。我们部队也分散到广大农村，发动群众，组织群众，进行土地改革，最大限度地调动了广大人民群众的革命积极性，发展和壮大人民武装力量，迅速改变了敌我力量对比，不到三年，就解放了全东北。
    毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”建立革命根据地，是发动群众，组织群众，宣传群众，武装群众的关键。有了根据地就有了群众，有了人民武装，有了政权，有了物资供应，有了战争胜利的保障。
    一九四二年，正是抗日战争第五个年头，敌人企图挽救它死亡的命运，向我们的抗日游击根据地发动了一次又一次疯狂的“扫荡”。在这个极端困难的时期，我们部队就是依靠根据地的广大人民群众，组成了坚强的铜墙铁壁。敌人“扫荡”，我们就针锋相对地进行“反扫荡”。在根据地广大人民群众的支持和配合下，我们的部队广泛开展游击战争，神出鬼没地打击敌人。根据地的群众帮助我们押送俘虏，运送伤员，运输军粮和弹药；部队每到一地，群众都给我们安排住处，站岗放哨，侦察敌情，传送情报；军民团结得如同一家人。敌人吹嘘的一次一次“大扫荡”，都在解放区军民的有力打击下彻底失败了。
    人民战争要依靠人民。有了根据地就有了人民；有了根据地，人民武装、革命政权才能存在、发展和壮大。
    今天，毛泽东思想的光辉已普照全球，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命人民，特别是东南亚地区的革命人民正在开展声势浩大的反对美帝及其走狗的武装斗争。正如林彪同志所说的：“今天的世界革命，从某种意义上说，也是一种农村包围城市的形势。”革命的红色根据地建立得越多，世界革命人民的武装斗争越发展，美帝灭亡之日也就越快。我们深信：毛主席的建立农村革命根据地，农村包围城市的战略思想，必定在全世界革命斗争中发挥出越来越大的威力；帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，最后一定被淹没在人民战争的海洋里。
