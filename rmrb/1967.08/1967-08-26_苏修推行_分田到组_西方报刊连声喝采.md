The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's implementation of measures such as "land distribution to production teams" in agriculture, aimed at developing private economy, has garnered praise from Western bourgeois media. The British newspaper *The Guardian* published an article titled "Small Work Teams Outperform Collective System," which lavishly praises the Soviet revisionists' capitalist restoration in agriculture.

The article states: "The Kremlin has transformed some state farms into small units working in teams, each unit needing no more than one or two families. The average Soviet state farm currently employs nearly seven hundred people, while the new teams consist of six people, sometimes fewer than six. If such experiments are allowed to continue, family farming and similar practices may eventually return to Russia."

The article extols: "The state's encroachment on private plots has been stopped, and favorable conditions have been provided for peasants, so the current output of private plots and livestock accounts for one-third of agricultural products."

The article further praises the Soviet revisionist newspapers' advocacy of "land distribution to production teams" and "land distribution to households," hailing it as "more reform-minded."

The article also specially applauds the Soviet revisionist *Literary Gazette* for publishing articles advocating capitalist restoration. The article says: "This newspaper discusses the old traditions of peasant families, their love for the land, passing it down from father to son, and strongly advocates that this is of great importance to the state and should be encouraged. This newspaper has come very close to the crux of the matter."

    苏修推行“分田到组”  西方报刊连声喝采
    苏修统治集团在农业上采取的“分田到组”等一系列发展私有经济的措施，博得西方资产阶级的连声喝采。英国《卫报》刊登的一篇题为《耕作小组胜过集体制》的文章，对苏修在农业上的资本主义复辟备加赞扬。
    文章说：“克里姆林宫已经使一些国营农场变成以小组工作的小单位，这种小单位不需要多于一两家人。苏联普通国营农场现在雇有将近七百人，而新的小组则由六人、有时少于六人组成。如果允许这种试验继续进行，家庭耕作制之类的东西就可能最终回到俄国来。”
    文章颂扬道：“国家对自留地的侵占被阻止了，向农民提供了便利条件，因此农民自留地和私有牲畜的产量，目前达到农产品的三分之一。”
    这篇文章还把苏修报刊鼓吹“分田到组”、“分田到户”的作法，吹捧为“更有改革精神”。
    文章还特别为苏修《文学报》刊登的鼓吹资本主义复辟的文章喝采，文章说：“这家报纸谈到农民家庭的老传统，谈到对土地的爱，把土地从父亲传给儿子，并且极力说这是对国家有巨大重要性的东西，国家应予鼓励，这家报纸已很接近这个问题的症结所在。”
