Vice Premier Chen Yi and Li Xiannian Receive and Host a Banquet for the Malian Government Delegation
China Resolutely Supports the Malian People's Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Struggle

According to Xinhua News Agency, on August 4, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian received Sedou Badian Kouyaté and the Malian government delegation he led. After the reception, both sides held a friendly and cordial talk.

In the evening, Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a banquet to warmly welcome the Malian friends. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Kouyaté, the head of the delegation, both spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi enthusiastically praised the Malian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle. He said, "Recently, the Malian people have once again faced new provocations from imperialism and reactionaries. We believe that the awakened Malian people will definitely strengthen their unity, persist in their struggle, overcome all obstacles and difficulties on their forward path, and foil the evil plots of imperialism and its accomplices. The Chinese government and people resolutely stand on the side of the Malian people and resolutely support the Malian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples are now in a new upsurge. U.S. imperialism is facing imminent doom in Vietnam, has become a pariah in the Arab world, and is surrounded by revolutionary peoples everywhere. Recently, unprecedented armed resistance by Black Americans has erupted within the United States. This is an important part of the global anti-U.S. storm. It greatly shakes the rule of the Johnson administration. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: 'National struggles, after all, are a class struggle issue.' The contradiction between American blacks and the American reactionary ruling class is an irreconcilable class contradiction. American blacks have broken through the barriers of 'non-violence,' consciously and on a large scale, using revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence. American workers have begun to fight side by side with blacks. This is the inevitable law of class struggle. The revolutionary actions of American blacks are excellent! The final victory will surely belong to the brave American blacks!"

Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned Soviet revisionism for betraying the world revolutionary cause. He pointed out, "The Asian and African peoples must oppose imperialism led by the United States and must also oppose Soviet modern revisionism. The day when the revolutionary peoples of the world thoroughly settle accounts with the Soviet revisionists will surely come."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, when talking about the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, said, "The Chinese people will definitely not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary peoples of the world, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out this great proletarian cultural revolution of world significance to the end."

Kouyaté, the head of the delegation, enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "We see that all revolutionary forces in China, inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, have joined the victorious movement of the cultural revolution. We are convinced that this great event of world significance is progressing along the broad road. Through this great revolution, a China that will forever be a revolutionary bastion and an unshakable pillar for the peoples of all countries will definitely emerge."

Kouyaté, the head of the delegation, said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have already achieved tremendous victories. The great Chinese people, by concretely applying the respected Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, have mastered nuclear weapons in a very short time. This is a great encouragement to the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America who are struggling for national independence and economic development. This also shatters the policy of nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail by imperialist aggressors. He said, imperialism's aggression in various parts of the world has raised the awareness of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Malian people resolutely join this anti-imperialist struggle, support all peoples who are fighting to defend their independence and national sovereignty, condemn imperialism's aggression in the Middle East, and pledge to support the brotherly Arab peoples."

Attending the banquet were Fang Yi, Han Nianlong, Chu Tu-nan, Ding Xilin, Hu Lijiao, and other relevant officials, as well as China's Ambassador to Mali, Ma Ziqing. The Malian Ambassador to China, Jisse, and African ambassadors to China were also invited to the banquet.

    陈毅、李先念副总理接见并宴请马里政府代表团
    中国坚决支持马里人民反帝反殖斗争
    据新华社四日讯　国务院副总理陈毅、李先念今天下午接见了塞杜·巴迪安·库亚特和由他率领的马里政府代表团。接见后，双方在亲切友好的气氛中举行了会谈。
    晚上，陈毅副总理举行宴会，热烈欢迎马里朋友。陈毅副总理和库亚特团长在宴会上先后讲话。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中热烈称赞马里人民的反帝反殖斗争。他说，最近，马里人民又面临着帝国主义和反动派新的挑衅。我们相信，觉醒了的马里人民一定会加强团结，坚持斗争，克服前进道路上的种种障碍和困难，粉碎帝国主义及其帮凶的罪恶阴谋。中国政府和人民坚决站在马里人民一边，坚决支持马里人民的反帝反殖斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，亚非拉人民的革命斗争，正处在一个新的高涨阶段。美帝国主义在越南面临灭顶之灾，在阿拉伯世界成为人人喊打的过街老鼠，在世界各地，陷入了革命人民的重重包围之中。最近在美国国内，爆发了空前的黑人武装抗暴斗争。这是全世界人民反美风暴的一个重要组成部分。这大大地摇撼着约翰逊政府的统治。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”美国黑人同美国反动统治集团之间的矛盾是不可调和的阶级矛盾。美国黑人冲破“非暴力主义”的藩篱，自觉地、大规模地用革命暴力来反抗反革命暴力，美国劳动人民开始同黑人并肩战斗，这是阶级斗争的必然规律。美国黑人的革命行动好得很！最后胜利一定属于英勇的美国黑人！
    陈毅副总理强烈谴责苏联修正主义出卖世界革命事业。他指出，亚非人民要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就必须反对苏联现代修正主义。全世界革命人民彻底清算苏修罪恶的日子一定要到来。
    陈毅副总理在谈到我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利时说，中国人民一定不辜负世界革命人民的期望，坚决沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这一具有世界意义的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    库亚特团长在讲话中热情地称赞中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，我们看到中国的一切革命力量，在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的思想的鼓舞下，投入到了文化大革命的胜利的运动中。我们确信无产阶级文化大革命这一具有世界意义的事件正沿着康庄大道前进。通过这场大革命，一个永远是革命堡垒、永远是世界各国人民不可动摇的支柱的中国必将诞生。
    库亚特团长说，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，已经取得了巨大胜利。伟大的中国人民由于具体地运用了尊敬的毛泽东主席的思想，在极短的时间内，掌握了核武器。这对为争取民族独立和经济发展而斗争的非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民也是一个巨大的鼓舞。这也粉碎了帝国主义侵略者的核垄断和核讹诈政策。他说，帝国主义在世界各地进行的侵略使亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫的人民提高了觉悟。马里人民坚决地投入了这场反帝斗争，支持一切为捍卫独立和国家主权而斗争的人民，谴责帝国主义在近东进行的侵略，并且保证声援兄弟的阿拉伯人民。
    出席宴会的有方毅、韩念龙、楚图南、丁西林、胡立教等有关方面负责人，以及中国驻马里大使马子卿。马里驻中国大使吉塞和非洲驻中国的使节也应邀出席了宴会。
