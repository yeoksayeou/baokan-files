The Revolutionary Committee of the Wuhan Region's Proletarian Revolutionaries issued an "Urgent Notice" on July 31, calling on all proletarian revolutionaries in the city to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to launch a new high tide in the proletarian cultural revolution, and to launch a new high tide in seizing the revolution and promoting production. This issue is raised very well, and it has important significance not only for the proletarian cultural revolution in the Wuhan region but also for the entire country.

"Seizing the revolution and promoting production" is an important strategic guideline proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. All revolutionary comrades must be pioneers in seizing the revolution and models in promoting production.

To implement Chairman Mao's great guideline of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is also a sharp and complex class struggle. The handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road and have been overthrown will not willingly retreat from the historical stage. The closer they are to death, the more frantically and viciously they will struggle. We must seize the revolution and vigorously promote production, and they will try every means to sabotage. They attempt to incite workers to leave their production posts, attempt to incite peasants to enter the cities, attempt to sabotage production, and disrupt social order. All officers and soldiers of our army, especially those units assigned to the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, must remain highly vigilant, help and educate the broad revolutionary masses to hold fast to their production posts, maintain social order, and guard against sabotage by class enemies.

Chairman Mao said: Revolution is to liberate productive forces, and revolution is to promote the development of productive forces. This is a universal truth. Wherever the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are overthrown, and wherever the proletarian cultural revolution is well conducted, there will inevitably be a new high tide in production.

The proletarian revolutionaries who have emerged from the cultural revolution must take on the attitude of masters, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and serve as the main force on the production front. They must not strike or take revenge against the deceived masses but must actively unite with them. They must hold fast to their production posts, observe labor discipline, and be highly vigilant against the sabotage plots of class enemies.

The deceived masses and cadres who have made mistakes must truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must respond actively to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and strive for the people. Even if some comrades cannot immediately change their minds, they must prioritize revolutionary interests and actively promote production. Class enemies will try every means to deceive and mislead the masses, to stir up antagonism between them and the proletarian revolutionaries, to spread malicious rumors, to incite armed struggles, and to sabotage production. The deceived masses and cadres who have made mistakes must never again fall for the enemy's tricks or be deceived by the enemy.

All comrades in our army, especially the broad officers and soldiers assigned to support industry and agriculture tasks, must be vigilant against the sabotage plots of class enemies, actively support production, and safeguard production.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces, we must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," together with the broad revolutionary masses, seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production.

    坚守生产岗位　严防敌人破坏
    武汉地区无产阶级革命派总指挥部，七月三十一日发出《紧急通告》，号召全市无产阶级革命派更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮。这个问题提得非常好，不仅对武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命有重要意义，而且对全国也有普遍意义。
    “抓革命，促生产”是我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的一个重要的战略方针。一切革命同志都要做抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。
    贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，也是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。被推翻了的党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，他们决不甘心退出历史舞台。他们越接近死亡，越要以十倍的疯狂、百倍的仇恨作垂死挣扎。我们要狠抓革命，猛促生产，他们就千方百计地进行破坏。他们企图煽动工人离开生产岗位，企图煽动农民进城，企图破坏生产，扰乱社会秩序。我军全体指战员，特别是担任“三支”“两军”任务的部队，要保持高度警惕，帮助和教育广大革命群众坚守生产岗位，维持社会秩序，严防阶级敌人捣乱。
    毛主席说：革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。这是一个普遍真理。哪里的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被打倒了，哪里的无产阶级文化大革命搞好了，哪里就必然出现一个生产的新高潮。
    在文化大革命中杀出来的无产阶级革命派，一定要以主人翁的态度，挑起革命和生产两副重担，充当生产战线上的主力军。对受蒙蔽群众决不打击不报复，而要主动团结他们。要坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，高度警惕阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部，要真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就要以实际行动，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，为人民立功。有些同志即使思想上一时转不过弯来，也要以革命利益为重，积极搞好生产。阶级敌人就是要千方百计地欺骗蒙蔽群众，挑起他们和无产阶级革命派之间的对立情绪，煽阴风，点邪火，挑起武斗，破坏生产。受蒙蔽群众和犯错误的干部，千万千万不要再上敌人的当，再受敌人的骗。
    我军全体同志，特别是担任支工、支农任务的广大指战员，一定要警惕阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，积极支援生产，保卫生产。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，我们一定要坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，同广大革命群众一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
     （八月三日）
