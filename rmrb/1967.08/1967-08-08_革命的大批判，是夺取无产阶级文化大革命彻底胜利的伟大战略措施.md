A revolutionary wave of unprecedented scale and magnificent momentum is sweeping across the country, marking a new stage in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. This is a great strategic measure to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is crucial for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles after the country is pacified. They will daily and hourly try to restore capitalism in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." Over the past year, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary groups across the country have exposed the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, turning them into "fallen dogs." However, they are always waiting for an opportunity to stage a comeback, attempting to regain power, carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration, and exact class revenge. The intense, complicated, and tortuous struggle experienced by the Cultural Revolution in our General Logistics Department vividly and powerfully proves Chairman Mao's wise judgment. In the repeated struggles against the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, we deeply feel that only by thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism and completely eliminating the poison of revisionism can we thoroughly smash the evil plots of the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party and the military to stage a comeback. Only then can we truly and thoroughly overthrow them not only organizationally but also politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Otherwise, they will seize power from us at any time, usurp our politics, carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration, and plunge the revolutionary masses into a sea of blood. It is through repeated struggles that we have gradually deepened our understanding of this issue, mastered and used the weapon of criticism, dealt a fatal blow to the class enemy, united the broad masses, achieved the great unity of the revolutionary masses, and won the struggle.

Last year, when the Cultural Revolution began in the General Logistics Department, the revolutionary masses, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the class enemy, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carried forward the spirit of "daring to rebel, daring to expose, daring to criticize, daring to struggle," firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, lifted the lid on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the General Logistics Department, exposed the clique of capitalism-roaders within the General Logistics Department, and carried out resolute exposure, criticism, and struggle against them, achieving great victories. However, at that time, the revolutionary masses did not thoroughly criticize and expose the capitalism-roaders, and the true proletarian leaders did not stand out, leaving room for the class enemy to exploit. Among the masses, due to insufficient understanding of the complexity of class struggle and the importance of continuing to carry out extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle, there was a tendency towards peaceful illusions. Some thought, "These exposed fellows have been criticized and struggled against and are now fallen dogs," "They are already stinking," "They can't cause big waves," and so on. The capitalism-roaders within the Party took advantage of the revolutionary masses' complacency, manipulating some people with ulterior motives to spread the idea that "the exposed ones are 'dead tigers,' and it's meaningless to struggle against them anymore." They used the slogan "Good comrades go fight live tigers" to incite the masses and direct the struggle against the proletarian leaders. Just as the "January Revolution" storm swept across the country, the clique of "fallen dogs" within the General Logistics Department and those who had not fallen into the water jumped out, driven by their reactionary class nature. Some operated behind the scenes, plotting and scheming; some pretended to be "informed individuals," spreading rumors and deceiving the people; some impersonated revolutionary leaders, openly "appearing," deceiving and cheating. They distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, disregarding the repeated instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, insisting on labeling a leader who firmly carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a capitalism-roader, and openly directing the struggle against the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and the Central Military Commission. They suppressed dissenting opinions, besieged the revolutionary factions, and carried out white terror, attempting to disrupt the class line in the General Logistics Department, reverse the enemy-people relationship, deceive the masses, and stir up a storm of counter-revolutionary seizure of power.

The harsh facts deeply educated us, making us deeply realize that class struggle is extremely complex. The exposed clique of capitalism-roaders is not "dead tigers" but mad dogs that have fallen into the water. If we do not pursue and strike them down thoroughly, criticize and expose them thoroughly, then the "dogs" that have fallen into the water will jump back onto the shore and launch a fierce counterattack when they have the opportunity. If we do not criticize and expose them deeply, the "dogs" that have not fallen into the water will act when the time is right. The fallen "dogs" and the unfallen "dogs" will form an alliance, fish in troubled waters, disrupt our lines, and shift the direction of the struggle, attacking us revolutionary masses and proletarian leaders. If we do not overthrow them, they will overthrow us. Therefore, we must show no mercy to them. Only by ruthlessly exposing them can we thoroughly overthrow them.

We revolutionary masses, braving storms and waves, daring to rebel and protect, broke through the white terror, and carried out resolute struggles against the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, protecting the proletarian leaders, and repelled the counter-attacks of a small clique of class enemies.

Under the guidance and care of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Cultural Revolution in the General Logistics Department has entered a new high tide. The victory of this struggle was achieved through a well-prepared mass debate. Through this debate, we further exposed, criticized, and struggled against the enemy, driving the "dogs" that had climbed back onto the shore and some that had not fallen into the water back into the water. Through this debate, we clarified the facts, restored the true image of the proletarian leaders, and upheld the revolutionary authority of the proletariat. Through this debate, many deceived masses opened their eyes, distinguished between enemies and ourselves, and clarified right and wrong, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, expanding and strengthening the ranks of the revolutionary masses.

However, the struggle has not ended. Although we have achieved great victories through a period of mass debate, the power of criticism has not been fully unleashed. We have not truly formed a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. The evil nature of the class enemy has not been fully exposed, and the criticism has not been thorough. Some issues of understanding among a part of the masses have not been completely resolved. Some deeply deceived masses have not yet drawn a clear line with the enemy. At the same time, facing our powerful offensive, the enemy has adopted a strategy of temporary retreat, lying low, waiting for an opportunity to stage a comeback. The article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" by Comrade Peng Zhen in the Red Flag magazine sounded the bugle for a general offensive against the number one capitalism-roader within the Party. We revolutionary masses in the General Logistics Department took further action, actively participating in the extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the General Logistics Department. Facing the prospect of doom, the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party became even more frantic, adopting more hidden and cunning methods to make their last struggles. They stirred up evil winds and lit ghost fires, manipulating a few conservative forces, deceiving some masses, and labeling the revolutionary masses' extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle against the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party as a "new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line"; calling those who came out to seize power from the Party "revolutionary leaders who have come out," and openly rehabilitating them. They continued to direct the struggle against the proletarian leaders, disrupting the struggle against the enemy, causing the struggle sessions to be interrupted multiple times. Thus, the Cultural Revolution in the General Logistics Department experienced another setback. With the deepening of the movement and the repeated struggles, we deeply felt that the enemy fears revolutionary criticism the most, fears the masses exposing their evil deeds, fears the masses using the magic mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose their true selves, and fears the masses exposing their ugly faces in broad daylight, making them lose face among the masses and collapse completely. The more the enemy fears criticism, the more we must carry it out. We must resolutely, thoroughly, and comprehensively carry it out, creating a typhoon of the twelfth level, fighting a "people's war." Facing the new counter-attacks of the class enemy, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and with the support of the revolutionary masses of the three military headquarters in Beijing, we overcame all obstacles and launched a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. Everyone used their brains, mouths, and hands, criticizing in writing and speech, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in the General Logistics Department. Through this criticism, we further exposed their counter-revolutionary revisionist faces, isolating them to the greatest extent, turning them into rats crossing the street, and thus thoroughly smashing the class enemy's frantic counter-attacks. We revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses also received education and tempering in the criticism, improving our ability to struggle against the enemy, strengthening our proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. In the revolutionary criticism, more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses united around the revolutionary masses, forming a great unity, preparing a more powerful revolutionary force for the further development of a more extensive mass criticism movement.

Over the past year, through repeated struggles against the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, we have come to realize that revolutionary criticism is the key to thoroughly overthrowing the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party and achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for carrying out revolutionary criticism; and the "people's war" is the guarantee for carrying out revolutionary criticism to the end. The battlefield of revolutionary criticism is the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The process of revolutionary criticism is the process of thoroughly criticizing and repudiating bourgeois and exploitative class ideology and thoroughly establishing Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, we are facing a great situation. The clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their supporters and protectors have been unprecedentedly isolated, falling into the vast sea of revolutionary masses. However, "to make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the cause of the people. They will never deviate from this logic." China's Khrushchev and the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party will not deviate from this logic either. They will never reconcile themselves to losing their "heaven" and "throne." Now, some of them pretend to repent while actually preparing for a counterattack; some are still secretly keeping accounts for a change of regime, ready to counterattack at any time; some continue to manipulate conservative organizations, stubbornly resist, and make their last struggles. We must not be complacent and lose our revolutionary vigilance.

"We should pursue the fleeing enemy with our remaining strength and not seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu." We will resolutely follow the great strategic deployment of the great commander Chairman Mao, pursue victory, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, carry out the great unity of the revolution, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, beat the "fallen dogs," launch an unprecedented "people's war," and thoroughly criticize the clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party and their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, combining it with the criticism of the clique of capitalism-roaders within our unit. We will thoroughly criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrow and expose them, throw them into the garbage heap of history, and let them stink for eternity, never to rise again! In the process of thoroughly criticizing the old world, we will build a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought!

    革命的大批判，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的伟大战略措施
    中国人民解放军总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    一个规模空前的、波澜壮阔的从政治上、思想上、理论上对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命的大批判的新高潮，正在全国蓬勃兴起。这是我国两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战进入了更广阔、更深入的新阶段的重要标志。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的伟大战略措施，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的关键。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”一年来，全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众揪出了以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总后台的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使这些家伙成了“落水狗”。但是，他们时刻都在伺机反扑，妄图东山再起，重新上台，实行反革命复辟，进行阶级报复。我们总后勤部机关无产阶级文化大革命所经历的尖锐、激烈、复杂、曲折的斗争过程，生动、有力地证明了毛主席的英明论断。在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反复较量的斗争实践中，我们深深体会到，只有彻底地进行革命的大批判，彻底清除修正主义的流毒，才能彻底粉碎党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图卷土重来的罪恶阴谋，才能不但在组织上，而且在政治上、思想上、理论上把他们真正彻底地打倒。否则，他们就随时有可能夺我们的权，专我们的政，实现反革命复辟，把革命群众投入血泊之中。我们正是在反复的斗争实践中，逐步加深了对这个问题的认识，掌握和运用大批判的武器，给了阶级敌人以致命的打击，团结了广大群众，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合，取得了斗争的胜利。
    去年，总后勤部机关文化大革命一开始，广大革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，发扬了“五敢”精神，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，揭开了总后勤部两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，揪出了总后勤部党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对他们进行了坚决的揭发、批判和斗争，取得了很大的胜利。但是，当时无产阶级革命派没有把走资本主义道路当权派彻底批臭，真正的无产阶级当权派也显不出香来，就给阶级敌人留下可乘之机。在群众中，由于对阶级斗争的复杂性和继续深入进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争的重要性认识不足，存在和平麻痹思想，有的认为“这些已被揪出来的家伙，经过批判斗争，已经是落水的狗了”，“他们已经臭了”，“掀不起大浪了”，等等。党内走资本主义道路当权派利用革命群众的麻痹情绪，操纵一些别有用心的人散布说：“被揪出来的是‘死老虎’了，再斗他们没有什么意思了”。并用“好样的去斗活老虎”的口号，来煽动群众，把斗争矛头指向无产阶级当权派。正当“一月革命”风暴席卷全国的时候，总后勤部党内一小撮“落水狗”和那些没有落水的“狗”，出于它们的反动阶级本性，纷纷跳了出来。他们有的在幕后操纵，出谋划策；有的诡称“知情人”，造谣惑众；有的冒充革命领导干部，公开“亮相”，招摇撞骗。他们颠倒黑白，混淆是非，不顾党中央、中央军委的一再指示，硬要把一位坚持执行毛主席革命路线的领导干部打成走资本主义道路的当权派，并公然把斗争矛头指向以毛主席为首的党中央，指向中央军委。他们压制不同意见，围剿革命派，实行白色恐怖，妄图搅乱总后勤部机关的阶级阵线，颠倒敌我关系，蒙蔽群众，掀起一场反党夺权的轩然大波。
    严酷的事实，深刻地教育了我们，使我们深深地认识到，阶级斗争是十分复杂的，已经被揪出来的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派绝不是什么“死老虎”，他们只是被打落水的疯狗。如果不对他们穷追猛打，彻底批倒、批臭，那末，已落水的“狗”，一有机会就会跳上岸来，疯狂反扑；如果不把他们批深批透，那些还未落水的“狗”，当气候一到，就会狗性发作。落水的“狗”和没有落水的“狗”，就会结成同盟，浑水摸鱼，扰乱我们的阵线，转移斗争的方向，打到我们无产阶级革命派和无产阶级当权派头上来。你不斗倒他，他就斗倒你。因此，对他们丝毫不能有怜悯。对他们只有无情揭露，才能彻底打倒。
    我们无产阶级革命派，顶狂风，战恶浪，敢“革”，敢“保”，冲破白色恐怖，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了坚决的斗争，对无产阶级当权派坚决保护，打退了一小撮阶级敌人的反扑。
    在毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席、中央军委、中央文革的多次指示和亲切关怀下，总后勤部机关的文化大革命又出现了一个新的高潮。这场斗争的胜利，是通过具有充分准备的群众性大辩论取得的。通过这场大辩论，对敌人进行了进一步大揭露、大批判、大斗争，把爬上岸来的“狗”和一些未曾落水的“狗”统统打入水中。通过这场大辩论，澄清了事实真相，恢复了无产阶级当权派的本来面貌，维护了无产阶级的革命权威。通过这场大辩论，使许多受蒙蔽的群众擦亮了眼睛，分清了敌我，明辨了是非，纷纷回到毛主席革命路线上来，发展壮大了无产阶级革命派的队伍。
    但是，树欲静而风不止，斗争并没有结束。虽然我们经过一个时期的群众大辩论取得了巨大的胜利，然而由于大批判的威力发挥得不够充分，还没有真正形成革命大批判的“人民战争”，对阶级敌人的反革命丑恶本质揭得还不够深，批得还不够透，在一部分群众中某些认识问题还解决得不彻底，一些受蒙蔽较深的群众，还没有和敌人彻底划清界线。同时，敌人在我们的强大攻势面前，采取了暂时退却的策略，潜伏下来，以待时机，东山再起。《红旗》杂志发表的戚本禹同志《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的文章，吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的号角。我们总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派，进一步行动起来，积极地投入了对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在总后勤部的代理人的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派面临覆灭的命运，他们感到自己的日子实在混不下去了，于是更以十倍的疯狂，采取更隐蔽、更狡猾的手段，进行垂死挣扎。他们煽阴风，点鬼火，操纵少数保守势力，蒙蔽一些群众，把革命群众对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，诬蔑为是“资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”；把跳出来进行反党篡权的分子称之为“站出来的革命领导干部”，公开为他们翻案。继续把斗争的矛头对准无产阶级当权派，破坏对敌斗争，使批斗会多次中断。这样，总后勤部的文化大革命出现了又一次反复。随着运动的深入和反复的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到，敌人不怕喊打倒，不怕喊罢官，最怕革命的大批判，最怕群众揭露他们的罪恶事实，最怕群众用毛泽东思想的照妖镜照出他们的原形，最怕群众把他们的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，使得他们在群众中威风扫地，彻底垮台。敌人越是害怕大批判，我们越是要搞大批判，我们要坚决地搞，彻底地搞，全面地搞，刮十二级台风，打“人民战争”。面对阶级敌人的新反扑，我们在毛主席革命路线指引下，在三军驻京机关无产阶级革命派的支持下，排除一切阻力，发动了革命大批判的“人民战争”，人人动脑，人人动口，人人动手，口诛笔伐，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫和他们在总后勤部的代理人。通过这次大批判，进一步揭露了他们的反革命修正主义嘴脸，使他们最大限度地孤立起来，成了过街老鼠，从而彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑。我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，也在大批判中受到了教育，得到了锻炼，提高了同敌人作斗争的本领，加强了无产阶级革命性、科学性、组织纪律性。在革命大批判中，百分之九十五以上的干部和百分之九十五以上的群众团结在无产阶级革命派的周围，形成了革命的大联合，为展开更加广泛的群众性大批判运动准备了更加强大的革命队伍。
    一年来，与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反复较量的实践，使我们认识到，革命的大批判，是彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，取得无产阶级文化大革命胜利的关键；光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是进行革命大批判的最锐利的武器；“人民战争”是把革命大批判进行到底的保证。革命大批判的战场，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好的课堂。革命大批判的过程，就是大破资产阶级、剥削阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的过程，大立特立毛泽东思想绝对权威的过程。
    目前，我们面临着一派大好形势，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其支持、庇护下的狐群狗党，已经空前孤立，陷入了广大革命群众的汪洋大海之中。但是，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”中国的赫鲁晓夫，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也是不会违背这个逻辑的。他们绝不甘心于失去他们的“天堂”和“宝座”。现在，他们有的以假检讨为名，行真反扑之实；有的还在暗地里记变天账，准备随时反攻倒算，有的继续操纵保守组织，负隅顽抗，作最后挣扎。对此，我们决不可掉以轻心，失去革命警惕性。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们坚决按照伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜追击，高举革命批判的大旗，实行革命的大联合，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，痛打“落水狗”，展开一场规模空前的“人民战争”，把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其推行的反革命修正主义路线，同批判本单位的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派结合起来，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，扔进历史的垃圾堆，让他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！在彻底批判旧世界的过程中，建设起一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！　（新华社）
