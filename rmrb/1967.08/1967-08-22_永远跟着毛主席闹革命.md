The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a profound ideological revolution that involves a thorough overthrow of the bourgeois worldview and the establishment of the proletarian worldview, a thorough overthrow of revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois ideology, and the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought. Our Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, said: "We must regard ourselves as a force in the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful."

Reflecting on the past year and a half of experience in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel that with every step forward in the Cultural Revolution, my thoughts undergo a fierce struggle between the two lines and two worldviews.

Standing on Which Side

In early September of last year, a Red Guard unit from Beijing, the "Long Chains Combat Team," arrived in Zigong City. They fanned the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ignited the fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and, together with a group of revolutionary students in our city, directed the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee.

The revolutionary actions of the Red Guard youths frightened the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee. They hated it to death and feared it to death, even resorting to various despicable means to suppress the revolutionary student movement. They organized some uninformed masses to attack the revolutionary students and spread a large amount of rumors, saying that the Red Guards from Beijing were "political thieves," that those who supported the "Long Chains Combat Team" were "rightists," "monsters and demons," and so on. My third daughter is a student at Zigong No. 2 Middle School, and she actively supported and participated in the revolutionary rebellious actions of the "Long Chains Combat Team." As a result, some people sneered at me, saying, "You are 'the father is a revolutionary, the daughter is a counter-revolutionary'!" There were also "well-meaning" people who advised me to "take good care of your daughter's future." I was very indignant at the despicable tricks played by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the municipal committee! At this time, I felt that how to treat my own children was actually a matter of how to treat the Red Guard youths and how to treat the capitalist-roaders within the Party. It was an important sign of which line I stood on. I thought, the Red Guards are supported by Chairman Mao, and their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Cultural Revolution is a glorious task given to them by Chairman Mao. My daughter's participation in the Red Guards and her bombardment of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the municipal committee are in line with Mao Zedong Thought, are revolutionary actions, and are not "counter-revolutionary" at all! Didn't Chairman Mao repeatedly call on young people to go through storms and waves to temper themselves? I should listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Chairman Mao's brilliant example, care for and support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youths, and care for and support my daughter's revolutionary actions!

One day, my daughter came home from school, looking a bit down, her eyes red from staying up. When she saw me, she almost burst into tears. It turned out that she had been besieged outside for days and nights, hadn't eaten well, hadn't slept well, and someone had spread rumors about her, saying that I was "very angry" about her actions. Seeing my daughter in this state, my mind was torn between "public" and "private." From the perspective of "private," I should keep my daughter at home for a few days to avoid the risk of being labeled a "counter-revolutionary." But the scenes of the youths bravely fighting day after day immediately drove away this fleeting thought. When the youths were divided and surrounded, they shouted, "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned," "We can be criticized, we can be struggled against, but we will never lower our revolutionary heads." From the bottom of my heart, I felt the loveliness of the youth in the Mao Zedong era. They responded to Chairman Mao's call, rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and I supported them, which was to carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I immediately told her, "You did the right thing, I fully support you!" And I encouraged her, "Only by fighting tenaciously can you fight them down, you have to be stronger!" These words greatly encouraged my daughter. After eating, she immediately returned to school to join the battle.

Similarly, my wife, because she insisted on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the municipal committee, was also attacked many times. I considered that although the revolutionary organization she participated in was temporarily in the minority, their criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line was correct in the general direction. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our whole family could give it all! I firmly supported my wife's revolutionary actions.

I realized that to carry out and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must have the courage to "risk one's life," and also have the revolutionary spirit of "risking one's family." If one gives up the line struggle and the political principles of the proletariat for the temporary gains and losses of oneself and one's family, that is a complete fool, that is a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In the Face of the Counter-Current

In late January of this year, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a call to us: The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left. This is the greatest concern and trust that Chairman Mao has for us! From that time on, we officially participated in this great revolutionary movement.

We responded to the call of the great leader, actively supported the revolutionary leftist organizations we had already identified, and helped them develop and grow stronger. In February, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Southwest Bureau and the Sichuan Provincial Committee manipulated their puppet conservative organizations to launch a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration counter-current, dissolving many revolutionary organizations illegally, and spreading slanderous leaflets about the revolutionary factions. Under a white terror, we were not confused or intimidated. We determined that all our words and actions must be measured against Mao Zedong Thought. This is our highest principle. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we support and carry it out; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we resist and oppose. In this way, we ignored any so-called "instructions" that were not in line with Mao Zedong Thought; we refused to distribute leaflets slandering the revolutionary factions; we continued to fully support the revolutionary factions in our city; and we also provided all possible conveniences to revolutionary comrades from outside the city. At that time, it was truly: "Pressure of ten thousand pounds, I stand firm and unmoved."

In early March, some people, in line with the counter-revolutionary counter-current in society, said that the revolutionary mass organizations we supported were "rightist organizations," that our armed department was harboring "monsters and demons," and declared that they would "expose the class struggle cover of the armed department" and "pull out the black backstage." This was precisely the critical moment to test whether a Communist Party member, a revolutionary, was absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. How much one needed to "make up one's mind, fear no sacrifice," and eliminate all interference from selfish thoughts! At that time, I had many considerations. I considered that they might remove my position, expel me from the Party... What should I do? Should I betray Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, betray the countless true revolutionary leftist masses, and go along with this counter-current, even become their henchman, suppress the revolutionary leftist organizations, and support conservative forces to preserve personal fame and fortune, position? Or should I stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fight together with the revolutionary leftist masses? Should personal safety come first? Or should the country's color not change first? At this moment, the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao rang in my ears again: "Communist Party members, no matter when and where, should never put personal interests in the first place, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." I made up my mind that under any circumstances, I would never betray Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, never betray the proletarian revolutionary factions. Even if my position was removed and I was imprisoned, it would be worth it. I firmly believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line would definitely be victorious, "darkness is about to pass, dawn is just ahead."

In this struggle against the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration counter-current, I, like the broad masses of revolutionary leftists in Zigong City, although I suffered various persecutions and setbacks, we had absolute faith and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We fought side by side with the revolutionary masses, tenaciously struggled, and finally defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

This struggle made me deeply realize that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, one can overcome all difficulties, overcome selfish thoughts, and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

In the Face of Praise

In the previous stage, due to the fact that the vast majority of comrades in our armed department firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carried out and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieved some results in the work of supporting the left, the entire city's revolution and production presented a new and vibrant scene. The armed department heard a chorus of praise, and the broad revolutionary masses had high trust in us. In this situation, if one becomes arrogant, does not humble oneself, does not make further efforts, and does not respect the masses, it is very easy to fall into the trap of doing things for others; if things go wrong, one will also carry out the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, how to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, constantly overcome selfish thoughts in one's mind, is an important issue of whether one can persist in carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this regard, I have lessons to learn.

Not long ago, I and a few service personnel of revolutionary mass organizations together prepared to hold a meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Because I did not fully understand and remember the great truth that "the masses are the real heroes, and we are often childish and laughable," I was afraid that the masses would take "excessive" actions, so I set some "frames" for the masses and overemphasized some unnecessary practices. As a result, the masses broke through these "frames" and turned the criticism and self-examination meeting into an accusation meeting, which had a very good effect and gave me a great lesson. I realized that I had not fully listened to the masses' opinions beforehand and had set "frames" for them too early, which was wrong. The comrades in the armed department also criticized me, and I thought their criticisms were correct. That evening, I exchanged opinions with a few service personnel of revolutionary mass organizations and told them that the standard for judging whether something is right or wrong should not be whether it is done according to what the armed department says, but whether it is in line with Mao Zedong Thought. I also expressed that I welcomed them to rebel against the armed department and my actions and words that were not in line with Mao Zedong Thought at any time.

This incident gave me a great lesson. It told me that the more the masses believe in themselves, the more I should believe in the masses, the more I should cherish their revolutionary enthusiasm, respect their revolutionary pioneering spirit, humbly listen to their opinions, consult with them on matters, and never regard myself as the superior of the masses, but should always honestly and sincerely be a small student of the masses.

The struggle between the two lines runs through the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the entire socialist revolution, and also runs through the entire process of our worldview reform. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the greatest interests of the laboring people, represents the highest demands of the proletariat, represents the fundamental direction of social development, and is the greatest public interest; the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Khrushchev of China serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, is for the restoration of capitalist private ownership, and is the greatest private interest. Criticizing and smashing the bourgeois reactionary line, carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the greatest act of breaking private interests and establishing public interests. This is a revolutionary principle that every revolutionary, especially the leading comrades, must uphold, and it must not be taken lightly. I will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought to reform my worldview, forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, and forever be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!

    永远跟着毛主席闹革命
    四川省自贡市人民武装部副部长　李宗伯
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，大破修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的深刻的思想大革命。我们的副统帅林彪副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    回想一年多来在无产阶级文化大革命中的经历，我深深感到，文化大革命每向前推进一步，自己思想上都要经过一场两条路线、两种世界观的激战。
    站在哪一边
    去年九月初，北京一支红卫兵“长缨战斗队”来到了自贡市。他们大煽无产阶级文化大革命之风，大点无产阶级文化大革命之火，并且联合本市一批革命学生，把斗争矛头指向旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    革命小将的这一革命行动，把旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派吓坏了。他们恨得要死，怕得要命，竟不惜采取种种卑鄙的手段来镇压革命的学生运动。他们组织了一些不明真相的群众去围攻革命学生，对革命学生散布了大量流言蜚语，说北京来的红卫兵是“政治扒手”，说支持“长缨战斗队”的是“右派学生”，是“牛鬼蛇神”等等。我的三女儿是自贡市二中的学生，她也积极支持并参与了“长缨战斗队”的革命造反行动。这样一来，有人对我冷嘲热讽，说：“你是‘老子革命，女儿反革命’呀！”也有的“好心人”劝我“要好好关心女儿的前途”。对市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所玩弄的这一卑鄙手法，我十分气愤！这时我觉得，如何对待自己的子女，实际上就是如何对待红卫兵小将，如何对待党内走资本主义道路当权派的问题，是衡量自己站在哪一条路线上的重要标志。我想，红卫兵是毛主席支持的，他们在文化大革命中斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是毛主席给他们的光荣任务。我的女儿参加红卫兵，炮轰市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是符合毛泽东思想的，是革命行动，决不是什么“反革命”！毛主席不是一再号召青少年到大风大浪中去锻炼吗？我应该听毛主席的话，学习毛主席的光辉榜样，关心和支持革命小将的革命行动，关心和支持我女儿的革命行动！
    一天，我女儿从学校回来，精神不太好，眼睛也熬红了，见了我差点哭出来。原来她在外面已被围攻了几天几夜，饭没吃好，觉没睡好，还有人对她造谣，说我对她的行动“很生气”。看到女儿这种神态，我头脑里的“公”与“私”展开了激战。从“私”字出发，我应该留女儿在家安居几天，躲避一下被打成“反革命”的风险。但连日来小将英勇斗争的场面，立即把我这一闪的念头赶得远远的。小将们在被分割包围的时候，高呼：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢”，“可挨批，可挨斗，决不低下革命的头”，我从内心深处，感到毛泽东时代的青少年的可爱。他们响应毛主席的号召，起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，我支持他们，也就是执行毛主席的革命路线。我马上对她说：“你做得完全对，我坚决支持你！”并鼓励她：“只有顽强斗争才能斗倒他，你要坚强一些！”这些话，对我女儿鼓舞很大。她吃完饭，就立即回到学校去投入战斗。
    同样，我的爱人因为坚持要批判市委所执行的资产阶级反动路线，受到了多次的围攻。我考虑到，她参加的革命组织虽然暂时处于少数地位，但是他们批判资产阶级反动路线，大方向是正确的。为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我们全家都可以豁出去！我坚决支持爱人的革命行动。
    我体会到：要执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，不但要有“舍得一身剐”的勇气，还要有“舍得一家剐”的革命大无畏精神。如果都为了一人一家的暂时得失，而放弃路线斗争，放弃无产阶级的政治原则，那就是十足的糊涂人，那就是对无产阶级革命事业的背叛。
    在逆流面前
    今年一月下旬，我们伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出了号召：人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。这是毛主席他老人家对我们的最大关怀，最大信赖！从那时起，我们便正式介入了这场伟大的革命运动。
    我们响应伟大领袖的号召，积极支持我们早已认准了的革命左派组织，帮助他们发展、壮大。二月份，西南局和四川省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，操纵他们御用的保守组织，掀起了一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流，不少革命组织被非法解散，污蔑革命派的传单满天飞。在一片白色恐怖之下，我们没有被迷惑、被吓倒。我们认定：我们的一切言论和行动必须以毛泽东思想为标准。这是我们的最高原则。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就拥护，就照办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就抵制，就反对。这样，我们对于不符合毛泽东思想的任何所谓“指示”，不予理睬；对于污蔑革命派的传单，我们拒绝散发；对于本市的革命派，我们继续全力支持；对于外地来的革命派战友，我们也给予他们一切可以给予的方便。在当时，真是：压力万千重，“我自岿然不动”。
    三月初，某些人迎合社会上那股反革命逆流，说我们支持的革命群众组织是“右派组织”，说我们武装部包庇了“牛鬼蛇神”，声言要“揭武装部的阶级斗争盖子”，要“揪黑后台”。这正是考验一个共产党员，一个革命者，是不是对毛主席、对毛主席的革命路线无限忠诚的关键时刻，多么需要“下定决心，不怕牺牲”，排除一切私心杂念的干扰呀！当时，我有许多考虑，我考虑他们可能要撤我的职，开除我的党籍……。怎么办？是背叛毛主席的革命路线，背叛无数真正的革命左派群众，去投合这股逆流，甚至充当他们的打手，去镇压革命左派组织，扶植保守势力，以保存个人名利、地位呢？还是坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和革命左派群众一道坚持斗争呢？是个人安危第一呢？还是国家不变颜色第一呢？这时，伟大领袖毛主席的声音又响在我的耳边：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”我下定决心，在任何情况下，决不背叛毛主席的革命路线，决不背叛无产阶级革命派。即使我个人撤了职，坐了牢，也在所不惜。我坚信毛主席的革命路线一定胜利，“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”。
    在这场与资本主义反革命复辟逆流的斗争中，我自己和自贡市的革命左派广大群众一样，虽然经受了各种迫害和挫折，但是我们对伟大领袖毛主席无限信仰，绝对忠诚，我们和革命群众并肩战斗，顽强斗争，终于捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    这次搏斗，使我深深体会到，有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就能排除万难，就能克服私心杂念，就能取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    在赞誉面前
    前一阶段，由于我们武装部的绝大多数同志，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，执行和捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，支左工作取得了一些成绩，全市的革命和生产都呈现出一派崭新的面貌。武装部听到一片颂扬声，广大革命群众对我们高度信任。在这种情况下，如果骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重群众，就很容易出现包办代替现象；搞得不好，自己也会执行资产阶级反动路线。所以，如何继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，不断克服头脑中的私心杂念，这是能否坚持执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的重要问题。这方面，我是有教训的。
    不久前，我和几个革命群众组织的勤务员一起筹备召开一个批判资产阶级反动路线的大会。由于我对“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”这一伟大真理理解不够，记得不牢，害怕群众发生“过火”行动，便给群众划了些“框框”，过分地强调了一些不必要的做法。结果群众突破了这些“框框”，把批判检查大会开成了控诉大会，效果很好，给了我很大教育。我意识到自己事先没有充分听取群众意见，过早地给他们定“框框”，这是不对的。武装部的同志也对我提出了批评，我觉得大家批评得很对。当天晚上，我就和几个革命群众组织的勤务员交换了意见，并对他们说，衡量一件事做得对不对，不能以是否照武装部说的办为标准，而应该看它是否符合毛泽东思想。我还表示，欢迎他们对武装部和我的不符合毛泽东思想的言行随时造反。
    这件事，对我教育很大。它告诉我，群众越相信自己，自己也越应该相信群众，越要爱护他们的革命积极性，尊重他们的革命首创精神，虚心听取他们的意见，遇事同他们商量，切不可把自己当成是群众的上司，而应该永远老老实实地甘当群众的小学生。
    两条路线的斗争，贯穿在无产阶级文化大革命和整个社会主义革命的始终，也贯穿在我们世界观改造的始终。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线代表了劳动人民的最大利益，代表了无产阶级的最高要求，代表社会发展的根本方向，是最大的公；以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，代表了资产阶级的利益，是为复辟资本主义私有制效劳的，是最大的私。批判和粉碎资产阶级反动路线，执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的破私立公。这是每个革命者，特别是领导同志，必须保持的革命大节，切切不可等闲视之。我一定永远用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，永远做毛主席的好战士！
