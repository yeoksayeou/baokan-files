The reactionary film "Visiting Indonesia" completely exposes the love and hate of the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

Look, the top capitalist-roader in the Party kowtows to the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie. He treats the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie as "brothers," fawningly praising them as "engineers building the bridge of friendship between our two countries," "great friends of the Chinese people," and "great warriors against imperialism in the international arena!" He shamelessly praises them, sings their praises, and tries to lull the revolutionary will of the Indonesian people. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party is cold as ice towards the Indonesian Communist revolutionary comrades and the working people. Once, the Indonesian leftist mass organizations requested to convey their warm greetings to Chairman Mao, but China's Khrushchev made these representatives of revolutionary mass organizations wait outside for three hours. At the airport, when the Indonesian service personnel wanted to shake hands and say goodbye, he frowned and said, "Shake hands for what!" putting on a haughty air. The top capitalist-roader in the Party loves the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, but hates the Indonesian progressives and the people, isn't that clear?

The top capitalist-roader in the Party is extremely satisfied with everything arranged by the Indonesian reactionaries. He loves everything that the reactionary bourgeoisie loves. At the handicraft exhibition in Jogjakarta, he was dazzled by the gold, silver, and jewels plundered by the Indonesian reactionaries, unable to let go, lingering for a long time. He indulges in the decadent bourgeois lifestyle, spending the whole day mixing with the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie and their wives and daughters. He said: "The leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie accompanied us from beginning to end, giving us meticulous care. All of this deeply moved us." No wonder he boasted about being the "president of Indonesia for nine days." But towards our great socialist motherland, towards our socialist system, he hates it to the core. He never mentions the great achievements of our people in self-reliance and striving for progress, not a word about the tremendous power of the Three Red Banners, instead he pours cold water and spreads cold winds.

In the nine days of his visit to Indonesia, China's Khrushchev clearly showed his love and hate through his words and deeds. He loves the capitalist system, the reactionary bourgeoisie, and the decadent bourgeois lifestyle; he hates the socialist system and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. From China's Khrushchev's love and hate, we clearly see his true colors: he is not a "veteran revolutionary" at all, but a thorough and thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionist.

    爱和恨
    ——斥反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》

    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》完全暴露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的爱和恨。
    你看，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派卑躬屈膝地拜倒在印尼反动资产阶级面前。他把印尼资产阶级头面人物当作“哥哥”，肉麻地吹捧他是什么“建筑我们两国友好关系大桥的工程师，是中国人民的伟大朋友”，“国际上反对殖民主义的伟大战士！”拚命地往他脸上贴金，为他歌功颂德，极力麻痹印尼人民的革命意志。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对印尼共革命同志和劳动人民却冷若冰霜。有一次，印尼左派群众组织要求转达他们对毛主席的亲切问候，但中国的赫鲁晓夫却让这些革命群众组织的代表在门外等候三小时之久。在机场上，印尼服务人员要求和他握手告别，他板着脸说：“握什么手！”摆出一副臭架子。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派爱的是印尼反动的资产阶级，恨的是印尼进步人士和人民，这不是一目了然吗？
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对印尼反动派为他安排的一切都感到极为满意。他喜爱反动资产阶级所喜爱的一切。在日惹市手工业展览会上，他对印尼反动派搜刮来的金银珠宝，看得眼花缭乱，爱不释手，久久舍不得离去。他沉醉在腐朽糜烂的资产阶级生活中，整天跟印尼资产阶级头面人物和资产阶级太太小姐们鬼混。他说：印尼资产阶级头面人物“从头到尾陪同我们，给了我们无微不至的关怀。所有这一切使我们深为感动。”无怪乎他大肆夸耀自己“在印尼当了九天总统。”而对我们伟大的社会主义祖国，对我国的社会主义制度，他却恨得要命。他闭口不谈我国人民自力更生、奋发图强所取得的伟大成果，只字不提三面红旗的巨大威力，相反却大泼冷水，大吹冷风。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在印尼访问的九天时间里，用自己的言行鲜明地表现了他的爱和恨。他爱的是资本主义制度、反动资产阶级和腐朽的资产阶级生活方式；恨的是社会主义制度和各国革命人民革命斗争。我们从中国赫鲁晓夫的爱和恨中，清楚地看出他的本来面目：他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是彻头彻尾、腐烂透顶的反革命修正主义分子。
