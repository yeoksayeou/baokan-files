We are a team from the Beijing People's Automobile Company. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, our team actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We demanded that all employees not bring disagreements into production. Differences in views should not affect production, thereby ensuring the normal completion of transportation tasks.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in our team, some production squad leaders had different views from ours. Some suggested replacing them. After analyzing the situation, we believed that many of them were old workers who had been deceived, but their essence was good. Through work, they could continue to manage the squad's work. In some vehicle groups, the two people had different views, and they often had heated arguments. Some suggested splitting the team. Therefore, on the one hand, we emphasized that differences in views should not be debated during work hours and should not affect production and work. On the other hand, we required the revolutionary faction to actively promote production and ensure safe transportation. For example, in one vehicle group, the ticket seller was a revolutionary, and the driver was deceived. The ticket seller actively prepared for the trip before departure, helped the driver refuel after the trip, and maintained cleanliness. Sometimes the driver would leave after work, and the ticket seller would do everything alone. The ticket seller also actively did political and ideological work, which deeply moved the driver.

Due to the revolutionary faction's persistent and meticulous ideological work, many deceived masses withdrew from the conservative organizations and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, joining the revolutionary faction. The proletarian revolutionary faction united the broad revolutionary masses politically, concentrated their firepower, and carried out criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, achieving one victory after another, and further promoting production.

    不把分歧带到生产中来
    我们是北京人民汽车公司的一个车队。我们车队在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，要求全体职工，不把分歧带到生产上来，不能因观点不同影响生产，因而保证了运输任务正常进行。
    我们车队无产阶级革命派掌权后，当时有些生产小队的组长同我们观点不同，有人主张调换他们。我们经过分析，认为他们很多是老工人，是受蒙蔽的，本质是好的，经过做工作，可以继续让他们管理小组的工作。有的车组，两个人的观点不同，平时见面火气很大，有人提出要拆班。于是我们一方面强调观点不同不能在工作时间辩论，不能影响生产和工作；另一方面要求革命派主动搞好生产，保证安全运输。如有个车组售票员是革命派，司机是受蒙蔽的，售票员主动做好出车前准备工作，收车后帮助司机加油，搞好卫生。有时司机下班就走，售票员就一人干，并且积极做政治思想工作，司机很受感动。
    由于革命派经常作耐心的细致的思想工作，许多受蒙蔽的群众退出了保守组织，回到毛主席无产阶级革命路线上来，参加了革命派。无产阶级革命派在政治上团结了广大革命群众，集中火力，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了批判斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利，进一步促进了生产。
