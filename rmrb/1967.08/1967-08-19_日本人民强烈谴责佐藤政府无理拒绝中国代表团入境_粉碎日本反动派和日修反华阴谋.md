Japanese people strongly condemn the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow the Chinese delegation to enter the country and smash the anti-China conspiracy of the Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese revisionists

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, the Sato government of Japan, in collusion with the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party, took the despicable action of unreasonably refusing entry to the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association visiting Japan. This has provoked strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the Japanese people. Many people in Kagami County, Kamifukoka Town, who are enthusiastic about the Japan-China friendship movement, expressed strong condemnation of the Sato government and the Miyamoto revisionist group in their talks with reporters from the Oriental News Agency.

	A young man named Lianmu said, "Now, China is successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This time, the warriors of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are coming to visit Japan and make contact with the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group are terrified. We firmly oppose the Miyamoto revisionist group and the Sato government colluding to carry out anti-China activities. The Miyamoto revisionist group is not only a tool of the Soviet modern revisionist group but has also degenerated into a lackey of U.S. imperialism."

	Women's activist Honda said, "This time, the Sato government's refusal to allow the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association to visit Japan shows that the Japanese reactionaries and the revisionist group are extremely afraid of the unity of the 800 million people of China and Japan. The measures taken by the Sato government this time further prove that our Japan-China friendship movement is a just cause, and it has obtained the broadest and strongest support from the Japanese people."

	Honda said, "No matter how rampant the Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group are, the Japanese people's ardent desire for friendship and unity with the Chinese people cannot be suppressed. We must mobilize the broad masses of the people to defeat their anti-China conspiracy."

	A Japanese friend named Xiaoquan said, "Our enemies are desperately trying to prevent the Japanese people from mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon of struggle. However, it has been proven that their attempt is futile. The Sato government openly uses the condition of not allowing the propagation of the theory of people's war and armed struggle to approve the entry of the Chinese delegation, which shows that they are terrified of these theories."

	Xiaoquan said, "Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war have already become powerful weapons in the armed struggles of the people in India, Burma, Indonesia, the national liberation struggles of black people in the United States, and the struggles of revolutionary people all over the world. Through our struggles against the enemy, we increasingly recognize the importance of seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought. We must genuinely take Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon of the Japanese people's struggle and persist in fighting to the end with the enemy."

	Japan-China friendship activist Guangmo Cao said, "At a time when the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their followers, along with reactionaries from various countries, are performing an anti-China grand chorus, the Japanese people can welcome the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association representing 700 million Chinese people. This is a serious blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Sato reactionary government and the Japanese Communist Party revisionist group are carrying out crazy sabotage. Guangmo said, "We must unite the broad masses of the people and persist in the struggle to realize the visit of the Chinese delegation to Japan."

    日本人民强烈谴责佐藤政府无理拒绝中国代表团入境
    粉碎日本反动派和日修反华阴谋
    据新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本佐藤政府同日共宫本修正主义集团合谋，无理拒绝中日友好协会访日代表团入境的卑劣行动，引起广大日本人民群众的强烈不满。琦玉县上福冈町许多热心于日中友好运动的人们，在向东方通讯社记者发表谈话时，对佐藤政府和宫本修正主义集团提出强烈谴责。
    一个名叫练木的青年说，现在中国正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命。这次，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国文化大革命的战士，要来访问日本和广大的日本人民进行接触，日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团就怕得要死。我们坚决反对宫本修正主义集团和佐藤政府串通一气进行反华。宫本修正主义集团不仅是苏联现代修正主义集团的爪牙，而且已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。
    妇女活动家本田说，这次佐藤政府拒绝中日友协代表团访日，说明了日本反动派和修正主义集团非常害怕日中两国八亿人民的团结。佐藤政府这次采取的措施，进一步证明了我们的日中友好运动是正义的事业，它得到了日本人民最广泛、有力的支持。
    本田说，不论日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团如何猖狂，日本人民热烈要求同中国人民友好团结的愿望是扼杀不了的。我们一定要动员广大人民群众，击败他们的反华阴谋。
    一位名叫小泉的日本朋友说，我们的敌人正在拚命阻止日本人民掌握伟大的毛泽东思想作为斗争的武器。但是，事实证明他们的这种企图是徒劳的。佐藤政府公然以不准宣传人民战争和武装斗争的理论作为批准中国代表团入境的条件，这就表明他们对于这些理论害怕得要死。
    小泉说，毛主席关于人民战争的英明思想，已经在印度、缅甸、印尼的人民武装斗争中，在美国黑人的民族解放斗争中，在全世界革命人民的斗争中，成为强有力的武器。我们通过对敌斗争，愈来愈认识到认真地学习毛泽东思想的重要性，我们要切实地把毛泽东思想作为日本人民斗争的武器，坚持和敌人斗争到底。
    日中友好活动家广末操说，在美帝、苏修及其追随者和各国反动派表演反华大合唱丑剧的时候，日本人民能够迎接代表七亿中国人民的中日友好协会访日代表团，是对美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团的一个严重打击，因此，佐藤反动政府和日共修正主义集团进行疯狂的破坏是毫不奇怪的。广末说，我们必须团结广大的人民群众，坚持斗争，使中国代表团实现对日本的访问。
