As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters a new stage of victory across the nation, our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao has issued a great call to the People's Liberation Army: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and perform new deeds in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

This is the greatest care, the greatest trust, and the greatest encouragement for the People's Liberation Army.

This is the greatest support, the greatest protection, and the greatest inspiration for the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses across the nation.

Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing."

The People's Liberation Army of China, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is a great army that is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the Party, to the people, and to the cause of the proletarian revolution. This army is the strongest pillar of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. It protects the ironclad mountain stronghold of the proletariat.

In the world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army has responded to Chairman Mao's great call, undertaking the glorious tasks of "three supports" and "two militaries." It has strongly supported the proletarian revolutionary masses, ensuring the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and making great contributions to the people in this new historical period.

Currently, the great task facing the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army is to respond to the great call of Vice Chairman Lin, continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fight shoulder to shoulder, and perform new deeds for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the proletarian dictatorship, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These elements are the most dangerous enemies of the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. The People's Liberation Army must always direct its fighting edge at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the current great struggle of criticism, the People's Liberation Army should, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses across the nation, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Only by completing this great historical task can we ensure that our Party and state do not change color and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The People's Liberation Army should further implement Chairman Mao's instructions to support the broad leftist masses, taking supporting, cherishing, helping, and relying on the proletarian revolutionary masses as the most important content of the army's love for the people. Over the past few months, the experience of the People's Liberation Army in "supporting the left" shows that to truly support the left, one must firmly stand on the proletarian stance, understand and master Chairman Mao's method of class analysis, and correctly identify the leftists. The most fundamental criterion for judging whether a mass organization is a revolutionary leftist organization is to see whether it truly supports Chairman Mao, whether it truly supports Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and whether it firmly stands on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Without the struggle between the two lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, any discussion of class analysis will fail to see the essence of the problem, the main trend of things, the direction of the struggle, and will lead to errors.

In the process of completing the new and arduous task of "three supports" and "two militaries," the People's Liberation Army has undergone great tempering and testing, forging a deep combat friendship with the proletarian revolutionary masses. To defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and support the proletarian revolutionary masses, they have bravely and fearlessly rushed into the fire without hesitation. When they make mistakes and errors in their work, they put revolutionary interests first, humbly listen to the criticism of the masses, seriously examine themselves, and quickly correct their mistakes. They truly practice what Chairman Mao said: "Persist in what is right for the people's interests, correct what is wrong for the people's interests." This fully demonstrates the sublime qualities of revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army," cherish the People's Liberation Army as they would their own eyes, work closely with the People's Liberation Army, and together make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better.

We believe that, after more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army, which has gained rich experience, will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, press on and advance in big strides, perform new deeds, and ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 为人民大立新功

    为人民大立新功
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命进入新的胜利阶段，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志向人民解放军发出了伟大的号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”
    这是对人民解放军最大的关怀，最大的信赖，最大的鼓励。
    这是对全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最大的支持，最大的爱护，最大的鼓舞。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    由毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是一支无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席、忠于党、忠于人民、忠于无产阶级革命事业的伟大军队。这支军队是我国无产阶级专政最坚强的柱石。它保卫着无产阶级的铁打江山。
    在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，担负了“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。它有力地支持了无产阶级革命派，保证了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，在新的历史时期为人民作出了重大的贡献。
    当前，人民解放军广大指战员所面临着的战斗任务，就是响应林副统帅的伟大号召，继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立新功。
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这些家伙，是广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子最危险的敌人。人民解放军，要始终把斗争的锋芒，直指党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在当前的革命大批判运动中，人民解放军应该和全国无产阶级革命派一道，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，彻底批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。只有胜利地完成这个伟大的历史任务，才能保证我们党和国家不变颜色，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    人民解放军应该进一步贯彻执行毛主席的支持左派广大群众的指示，把支持无产阶级革命派，爱护无产阶级革命派，帮助无产阶级革命派，依靠无产阶级革命派，作为军队爱民最重要的内容。几个月来，人民解放军“支左”的经验表明，要真正地支持左派，必须坚定地站在无产阶级立场，懂得和掌握毛主席的阶级分析方法，正确识别左派。我们判别一个群众组织是不是革命的左派组织，最根本的就是要看它是不是真正拥护毛主席，是不是真正拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是不是坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级司令部一边。离开了无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的斗争，去谈什么阶级分析，就会看不到问题的本质，看不到事物的主流，看不到斗争的大方向，就会犯错误。
    人民解放军在完成“三支”“两军”这样一个崭新的、艰巨的任务的过程中，经受了极大的锻炼和考验，与无产阶级革命派结下了深厚的战斗友谊。为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为了支持无产阶级革命派，他们英勇无畏，赴汤蹈火在所不辞。当他们在工作中有了缺点和错误的时候，他们又以革命利益为重，虚心听取群众的批评，认真检查，迅速改正。真正做到毛主席所讲的：“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”。这充分表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的崇高品质。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要按照毛主席的“相信和依靠人民解放军”的伟大教导，象爱护自己的眼睛一样，爱护人民解放军，同人民解放军密切合作，共同把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    我们相信，经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了丰富经验的人民解放军，一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，阔步前进，大立新功，保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利。
