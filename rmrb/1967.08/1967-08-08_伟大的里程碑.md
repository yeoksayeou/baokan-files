A Great Milestone

Last August, at a critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This was a historic meeting of great significance in the history of the proletarian revolution in our country, and it had a profound impact on the international communist movement. It was a great milestone in the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country.

This plenary session achieved an immortal feat in the history of our Party by scientifically expounding the great significance and important position of Mao Zedong Thought in the development of Marxism-Leninism, and further establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The session emphasized: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage."

What is particularly worthy of celebration is that at this plenary session, our great leader Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, who has always upheld the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two lines within the Party, and who has been the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in defending and implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Comrade Lin Biao, was designated as our deputy commander-in-chief.

At this plenary session, Chairman Mao issued the great historical document "Bombard the Headquarters," exposing and defeating the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

At this plenary session, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," known as the Sixteen Points, and issued the "Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party." The two important historical documents of the plenary session further expounded the theory, line, policy, method, and principles of conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out the bright path of carrying the socialist revolution to completion and transitioning to communism.

The success of this meeting was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

One year has passed since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

Over the past year, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, under the personal leadership of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and guided by the brilliant proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, have launched an unprecedented revolutionary mass movement in world history. They have defeated the frenzied counterattack of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, achieved great victories, accumulated extremely rich and precious experience, and brought about new faces on all fronts.

Over the past year, in the great storm of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists have been exposed. The bourgeois headquarters has been smashed. In the great revolution, a strong contingent of proletarian revolutionaries has been forged, and thousands and tens of thousands of young revolutionary pioneers have emerged. A large number of revolutionary cadres have also been tested. A new generation of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution is growing up vigorously.

The People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lin, has achieved new merits in the "three supports and two militaries" work. The ties between the army and the people have been greatly strengthened, and the troops have undergone great new tempering. Such an unparalleled people's army is the most reliable and strongest guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion.

Over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses have, in conjunction with the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This has been a year of the great dissemination and deepening of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Once Mao Zedong Thought, this weapon of unparalleled power, is grasped by the masses, it further promotes the thought revolutionization of people and becomes a mighty material force for transforming the objective world. It can be foreseen that this great revolution will push the cause of socialist construction in our country to a new high tide.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out in our great country, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' dreams of achieving "peaceful evolution" and restoring capitalism in our country, greatly supporting and inspiring the revolutionary masses and all revolutionary people around the world. It has made the great struggle against imperialism and revisionism more vigorous.

This has been a year of tremendous upheaval. As Comrade Lin Biao summed up, "The losses are the smallest, smallest, smallest, while the gains are the greatest, greatest, greatest." Such a great victory has brought about a great situation and a great momentum for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the mainstream of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is continuing to advance victoriously along the direction of the struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that in observing the situation, we should "look at the essential and mainstream aspects of a problem," and "not neglect the non-essential and non-mainstream aspects of a problem, but must solve them one by one. However, we should not regard these as the essence and mainstream, lest we be misled and lose our direction." When we analyze the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must arm our minds with such a revolutionary dialectical viewpoint.

At present, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must continue to press forward and advance victoriously. They must, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. This is the most important and glorious central task for the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the country.

The Sixteen Points clearly point out: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." They "must be fully exposed, fought down, fought over, and their influence must be eliminated."

The great criticism of the revolution is a great strategic measure to thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Only by fully exposing, deeply criticizing, and thoroughly denouncing the counterrevolutionary crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and eliminating their influence in all fields, can they be defeated politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and the bourgeois headquarters can be thoroughly smashed.

The great criticism of the revolution, in which hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses participate directly, is the best classroom for cultivating a new generation of firm and reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The proletarian revolutionaries and young revolutionaries who have emerged from the fierce struggle between the two lines must further master the great Mao Zedong Thought, further learn to "criticize the bourgeoisie," learn to distinguish between proletarian leaders in power and bourgeois leaders in power, learn to distinguish between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, and learn to make revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They must be good at linking the criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party with the struggle to criticize, struggle, and reform in their own regions, departments, and units, with the struggle to win over the deceived masses, with the struggle to achieve revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and with the struggle to seize power and hold power well.

The great criticism movement against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party is entering a new high tide. Comrades, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance courageously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion.

    伟大的里程碑
    去年八月，在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开了党的八届十一中全会。这是我国无产阶级革命历史上具有划时代意义的一次会议，是对国际共产主义运动有着深远影响的一次会议。它是我国无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大的里程碑。
    这次全会，在我党历史上的不朽功勋，就是科学地阐明了毛泽东思想在马克思列宁主义发展史上的伟大意义和重要地位，进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。全会强调指出：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
    特别值得我们庆贺的是，在这次全会上，我们伟大领袖毛主席最亲密的战友，在党内两条路线的斗争中一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最忠诚、最坚决、最彻底地捍卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的林彪同志，被确定为我们的副统帅。
    在这次全会上，毛主席发表了具有伟大历史意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报，揭露和打败了隐蔽在无产阶级专政机构内部的、以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
    在这次全会上，毛主席亲自主持制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即十六条，发表了《中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议公报》。全会的这两个重要历史文件，进一步阐明了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，指出了把社会主义革命进行到底、由社会主义过渡到共产主义的光辉道路。
    这次会议的成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    八届十一中全会到现在，已经整整一年了。
    一年来，亿万革命群众在我们伟大统帅毛主席的亲自领导下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉指引下，开展了世界历史上空前规模的伟大革命群众运动，打垮了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的猖狂反扑，取得了伟大的成就，积累了极其丰富和宝贵的经验，在各个战线上都出现了新的面貌。
      一年来，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风暴中，中国的赫鲁晓夫，一小撮反革命修正主义分子，被揭露出来了，资产阶级司令部被冲垮了。在大革命中，锻炼出一支坚强的无产阶级革命派队伍，涌现出千百万年轻的革命闯将，也考验了一大批革命的领导干部。一代无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在茁壮地成长。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副统帅亲自指挥的人民解放军，在“三支”“两军”的工作中，立下了新的功勋。军队和人民群众的联系大大加强了，部队受到了极大的新锻炼。这样一支举世无双的人民军队，是我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的最坚强、最可靠的保证。
    一年来，广大革命群众结合无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想大普及、大传播、越来越深入人心的一年。毛泽东思想这个威力无比的精神原子弹，一旦为群众所掌握，进一步促进人的思想革命化，就变成改造客观世界的宏伟的物质力量。可以预期，这场大革命一定能够把我国的社会主义建设事业推向一个新高潮。
    在我们这个占世界人口四分之一的伟大国家里所进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义在我国实现“和平演变”、搞资本主义复辟的幻想，极大地支持和鼓舞了全世界无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民，把反帝反修的伟大斗争，更加蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
      这是翻天覆地的一年。正如林彪同志所概括的，“损失是最小最小最小，而得到的成绩是最大最大最大。”这样一个大胜仗，大胜利，带来了无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大好局面。这是无产阶级文化大革命的主流。无产阶级文化大革命正在沿着斗争的大方向继续胜利前进。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席一再教导我们，观察形势，要“看问题的本质方面，主流方面”，“不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”我们在分析无产阶级文化大革命形势的时候，必须用这样一种革命的辩证法的观点来武装我们的头脑。
    当前，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众必须再接再厉，乘胜前进，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。这是全国无产阶级革命派最重要、最光荣的中心任务。
    十六条明确指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”对他们“要充分揭露，要斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，肃清他们的影响”。
    革命的大批判，是彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战略措施。只有对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命罪行进行充分揭露，深刻批判，彻底搞臭，把他们那套反革命修正主义路线在各个领域的流毒彻底肃清，才能从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们打倒，才能彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    由亿万革命群众直接参加的革命大批判，是培养一代坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人的最好课堂。从两条路线激烈搏斗中冲杀出来的无产阶级革命派和革命小将，要进一步掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，进一步学会“批判资产阶级”，学会识别无产阶级当权派和资产阶级当权派，学会区分无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部，学会在无产阶级专政的条件下干革命。要善于把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改联系起来，同争取受蒙蔽群众的斗争联系起来，同实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合的斗争联系起来，同夺好权、掌好权的斗争联系起来。
    对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，正在进入一个新高潮。同志们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
