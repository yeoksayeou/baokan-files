The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has been highly active in the heart of the U.S. puppet regime. In the first half of this year, military personnel and civilians in areas such as Saigon and Cho Dong have achieved significant victories by actively attacking the enemy.

According to an incomplete count, they have killed, wounded, or captured over 23,600 enemy soldiers (including more than 14,000 U.S. invaders and their lackeys), dissolved 7,200 puppet soldiers, shot down, destroyed, or damaged over 230 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 580 tanks and armored vehicles, sunk or damaged 100 military ships, destroyed 20 cannons, blown up 21 bridges, and burned down 7 ammunition and oil depots. Additionally, they have seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The report states that as the U.S. bandits and their lackeys intensify their activities in the battlefields near Saigon, the military personnel and civilians in these two regions continue to strike the enemy with great force. The three types of armed forces work closely together, surrounding and threatening various small outposts while attacking large outposts and bases, eliminating a significant portion of the enemy's main forces, and breaking through the enemy's defensive lines around Saigon.

Local forces and guerrilla units have repeatedly defeated the enemy's numerous "sweeping" operations. In particular, the guerrilla units in the counties of Mê Linh and Sóc Trăng in the Saigon-Cho Dong region have made significant progress. They successfully repelled the enemy's two "sweeping" operations in January and June, achieving the major victory of eliminating over 1,300 enemy soldiers, most of whom were U.S. invaders. In the New An-Di An region, guerrilla units in areas such as Di An, Bình Dương, Di An, Hòa Bình, Tân Bình, Tân Thạnh, and Long An have eliminated over 2,800 U.S. puppet soldiers. The movement to shoot down planes and attack military vehicles has also rapidly developed.

The liberation armed forces in these two regions have also penetrated into enemy-occupied areas, attacking enemy bases and personnel in cities and towns, including puppet government officials, puppet police, and "pacification" forces. The armed self-defense forces in Saigon once attacked seven targets in the city center in one night, causing the enemy to be terrified and greatly promoting the political struggle of the urban population.

    南越解放军在美伪心脏地区异常活跃
    西贡等地军民上半年歼敌两万多毁伤敌机二百多架
    新华社河内八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区和新安—堤岸地区军民，在今年上半年内，大力发挥主动优势，连续地进攻敌人，取得了巨大的胜利。据不完全统计，共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人两万三千六百多名（其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军一万四千多名），瓦解伪军七千二百多名，击落击毁和击伤敌机二百三十多架，击毁和击伤坦克、装甲车五百八十多辆，击沉击伤军用船艇一百艘，击毁大炮二十多门，炸毁桥梁二十一座，烧毁军火库和汽油库七座，另外还缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    报道说，正当美国强盗及其走狗在紧靠西贡的战场不断加强活动的时候，这两个地区的军民仍然主动地给敌人以猛烈的打击，三种武装力量紧密配合作战，一方面包围和威胁各个小据点，一方面袭击各个大据点和基地，消灭了美伪军一部分主要的力量，打破了敌人在西贡周围的防线。
    地方部队和游击队接连挫败了敌人的许多次“扫荡”。特别是西贡—嘉定地区芽?县和旭门县游击队获得了很大进展，他们在一月份和六月份粉碎了敌人的两次“扫荡”，取得了歼敌一千三百多名的重大战果，被歼敌军绝大多数是美国侵略者。新安—堤岸地区单是迪建、平静、日早、协盛、新宝、盛利、良和等歼美包围圈的游击队就消灭了美伪军二千八百多名。游击队打飞机和打军车的运动，也有了迅速的发展。
    这两个地区的解放武装力量还深入敌占区，袭击敌人的基地和城镇中的伪政权人员、伪警察和“绥靖”队人员等。西贡市武装自卫队曾经在一个夜晚袭击市中心的七个目标，使得敌人胆战心惊，大大地推动了城市人民的政治斗争。
