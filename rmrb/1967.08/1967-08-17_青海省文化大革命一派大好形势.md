Following the great helmsman Chairman Mao's guidance, we will achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution

The great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in Qinghai has inspired the revolutionary forces to grow stronger. The revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination have been successfully realized, and the revolutionary criticism has been deepening step by step, driving the rapid development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

Reported by our reporter: The reporter comments: After more than a year of intense proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has taken root in the hearts of the people in Qinghai Province. The revolutionary forces, with "August 18" as the core, have grown stronger, the conservative organizations have disintegrated, and a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have been engulfed by the vast sea of criticism and struggle by the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination have been successfully realized, and the various policies of the Cultural Revolution are being smoothly implemented. From cities to rural areas, from agricultural regions to pastoral areas, the Cultural Revolution has presented a great and prosperous situation.

The proletarian revolutionary forces in Qinghai Province have been united, whether during the rampant period of the bourgeois reactionary line or after the decisive victory over the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. Currently, various industries have achieved a great alliance under the leadership of the "August 18" revolutionary rebel faction, including more than forty other revolutionary mass organizations. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and with the spirit of beating a fallen dog, they launch a great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Qinghai.

The proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province has become a powerful driving force for the rapid development of socialist construction throughout the province. Many industrial products have surpassed the level of the same period last year in terms of both quantity and quality. Crops throughout the province are growing well and are expected to be a bumper harvest since liberation. The number of lambs has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. This is the result of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and herdsmen in Qinghai Province faithfully implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, never deviate from the direction of the struggle

The proletarian revolutionary forces in Qinghai Province, with "August 18" as the core, are loyal to the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, always adhering to the direction of the struggle.

Since the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Qinghai Province have undergone two severe tests of white terror.

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in Qinghai Province faithfully implemented the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. They manipulated conservative organizations to persecute the proletarian revolutionary forces in various ways, attempting to divert the direction of the struggle and cover up their own crimes. However, revolutionary factions such as "August 18" saw through this plot and always directed the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

As the movement developed, the class enemies viciously attacked "August 18" and other revolutionary factions, accusing them of "striking one and protecting a nest," attempting to sow discord between the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of cadres. However, revolutionary factions such as "August 18" did not fall for it. They resisted the bourgeois reactionary line of "doubt everything, exclude everything, and overthrow everything" and warmly welcomed and supported revolutionary cadres to join the revolution. Because of this, from the beginning, a group of cadres in various levels of leadership in Qinghai Province joined the revolutionary masses of "August 18" and other revolutionary factions to fight side by side, forging a deep friendship and creating good conditions for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

After revolutionary factions such as "August 18" crushed the February counter-revolutionary restoration tide in Qinghai Province and achieved another advantage in politics and organization, the class enemies attempted to shift the blame for suppressing the revolutionary masses to the masses who were deceived by them. At this time, revolutionary factions such as "August 18" remained sober-minded, exposed the enemy's tricks, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings on strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions, educated, won over, and united the deceived masses, isolating a handful of enemies.

The army and the people are united as one, see who can challenge us

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai has made great contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work.

After the start of the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in Qinghai Province colluded with a few counter-revolutionaries within the army to launch a counter-revolutionary restoration tide, crazily suppressing the revolutionary masses and persecuting the commander of the Qinghai Military Region, Comrade Liu Xianquan, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers. Under their deception, some units made mistakes in the "leftist" work. However, due to the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the unremitting struggle of Comrade Liu Xianquan, the broad masses of soldiers and officers, and the proletarian revolutionary forces, the counter-revolutionary restoration tide was quickly smashed.

After that, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and actively carried out the "three supports and two militaries" work. They stood firmly on the side of the revolution, held high the banner, firmly supported the revolutionary leftists, and firmly united with the majority. Even if there was only one "August 18" soldier in a unit, they actively supported and helped to establish and expand the organization, making the "August 18" revolutionary organization from weak to strong and from a minority to a majority. The "leftist" units of the PLA also actively promoted Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary forces and studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with them, making the proletarian revolutionary forces grow rapidly in politics.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai is truly the army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and the army personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. They have excellently completed the "leftist" tasks in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Qinghai Province and have become a strong pillar of the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The PLA loves the proletarian revolutionary forces, and the proletarian revolutionary forces love the PLA. The army and the people are united as one, see who can challenge us. The unprecedented unity between the army and the people in Qinghai Province is a very important factor in achieving the great revolutionary situation in Qinghai Province.

They are both revolutionary pioneers and models of unity

During the days of white terror, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Qinghai Province were united and fought side by side, sharing life and death and hardships. After victory, this unity was once affected by individualism, small-groupism, factionalism, and anarchism, and there was a danger of split for a short period.

The key to unity within the revolutionary forces lies in the unity among the leading members of the revolutionary organizations. Just as the "August 18" and other revolutionary organizations showed signs of splitting, the preparatory group of the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee helped the leading members of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Alliance to carry out a small rectification campaign. Everyone gathered together, studied the "Three Old Articles," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and correctly handled the contradictions among the people. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, frankly exchanged opinions with each other, and through heart-to-heart talks, used the spirit of self-criticism to fight against the "self" in their minds. A leading member of worker origin, putting the overall situation first, voluntarily expressed his intention to cause a split and promised to correct his mistake and consolidate the unity within the revolutionary forces with practical actions. This rectification campaign promoted the revolutionary great alliance. It was proven that the most effective way to solve contradictions among the people is to carry out rectification and make more self-criticisms. With the spirit of self-criticism, misunderstandings and differences can be eliminated, thoughts can be unified, and enemies can be fought together.

Defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending the Party's policies and strategies

The "August 18" and other revolutionary factions in Qinghai Province suffered the most brutal suppression during the two periods of white terror created by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in Qinghai Province.

A severe test was placed before the "August 18" and other revolutionary factions: how to deal with the masses who had persecuted them due to being deceived?

On this issue, the "August 18" and other revolutionary factions, following Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions. Except for a few extremely evil elements who were subjected to dictatorship, they implemented the policy of "no crime for being deceived, merit for turning over a new leaf" towards the broad masses of cadres who were deceived, and through education, winning over, and uniting, they brought them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To win over the deceived masses, the soldiers of the "August 18" and other revolutionary factions did not calculate personal grievances, put revolutionary interests first, and actively sought out those who had been deceived and persecuted them in the past to do political and ideological work, telling them that all grudges should be held against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and as long as they quickly corrected their mistakes and turned against the enemy, they would not be revengeful but would welcome them. This greatly moved the deceived masses and cadres.

Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations personally did the work of winning over the deceived masses and cadres and took the lead in implementing the Party's policies. The commander of the "August 18" Red Guard Fighting Team of the Sixth Motor Transport Depot in Qinghai Province, Jia Youcun, was persecuted by a worker who participated in the conservative organization during the white terror of the counter-revolutionary restoration. After the counter-revolutionary restoration tide was smashed, that worker trembled and found Jia Youcun to admit his mistake. Jia Youcun said to him: "The account of persecuting the revolutionary faction must be settled, but it cannot be settled with you, it should be settled with the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party; the grudge must be avenged, we avenge the class grudge, not personal grudges, it cannot be avenged on you, it should be avenged on the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. We come from all over the country, all for the revolution, as long as you correct your mistakes, we will unite to overthrow a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party." That worker, moved, said to Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao, it is you who have nurtured such good revolutionary fighters, I will learn from them and stand with them." Later, this worker exposed many crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within the depot.

The "August 18" and other revolutionary factions thus selflessly implemented the Party's policies, educated, won over, and united the broad masses of cadres and deceived masses, isolating a handful of enemies to the greatest extent.

Now, the situation of the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province is getting better and better. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations said that although there are still differences within the revolutionary forces on some issues, these differences can be smoothly resolved in the high tide of great criticism and struggle. On August 12, Qinghai Province established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ—the revolutionary "three-in-one" Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a victory of the proletarian revolutionary forces, the broad revolutionary masses, the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary cadres who loyally act according to Chairman Mao's teachings!

### 青海省文化大革命一派大好形势

    遵循伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利
    青海省文化大革命一派大好形势
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在青海取得了辉煌胜利，革命队伍不断壮大，革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”胜利实现，革命大批判步步深入，推动了工农业和牧业生产迅速发展。
    本报讯　本报记者述评：青海省经过一年多轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心，以“八·一八”为主体的革命队伍不断壮大，保守组织已经瓦解，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经陷入广大革命群众大批判大斗争的汪洋大海之中，革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”胜利实现，文化大革命的各项方针政策正在顺利贯彻。从城市到乡村，从农业区到牧区，文化大革命出现一派大好形势。
    青海省无产阶级革命队伍无论是在资产阶级反动路线猖狂时期，还是在粉碎反革命复辟逆流并取得决定性胜利以后，都是团结的。目前，各行各业已经实现了以“八·一八”革命造反派为主体，包括其他四十多个革命群众组织的归口大联合。他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以痛打落水狗的精神，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人展开大批判、大斗争。
    青海省的无产阶级文化大革命已成为推进全省社会主义生产建设迅速发展的强大的动力。许多工业产品在产量上和质量上都不同程度地超过了去年同期的水平。全省农作物普遍生长良好，将是解放以来的特大丰收。羊羔比去年同期大为增加。这是青海省工人阶级、广大贫下中农、牧民忠实执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果。
    紧紧掌握斗争的大方向  时刻不离斗争的大方向
    青海省以“八·一八”为主体的无产阶级革命派，忠于光焰无际的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，始终坚持斗争大方向。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，青海省无产阶级革命派，经历了两次白色恐怖的严峻考验。
    文化大革命初期，青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，忠实地执行了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所制订的资产阶级反动路线。他们操纵保守组织，对无产阶级革命派进行种种迫害，妄图转移斗争的大方向，掩盖他们自己的罪行。但是“八·一八”等革命派组织，识破了这种阴谋，始终把矛头狠狠地指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    随着运动的发展，阶级敌人又恶毒地攻击“八·一八”等革命派是“打一个，保一窝”，挑拨无产阶级革命派与广大干部的关系。但是“八·一八”等革命派组织没有上当，他们顶住了“怀疑一切、排斥一切、打倒一切”的资产阶级反动路线，热情地欢迎和支持革命的领导干部起来革命。正因为这样，青海省各级领导干部中，一开始就有一批人和“八·一八”等革命派群众并肩战斗，结下了深厚的友谊，为实现革命的“三结合”创造了良好的条件。
    当“八·一八”等革命派粉碎了青海省二月反革命复辟逆流，在政治上、组织上又一次取得优势以后，阶级敌人又妄图把镇压革命群众的罪责，推给受他们蒙蔽的群众。这时，“八·一八”等革命派保持清醒的头脑，戳穿了敌人的诡计，按照毛主席关于严格区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，教育、争取、团结了受蒙蔽的群众，孤立了一小撮敌人。
    军民团结如一人  试看天下谁能敌
    中国人民解放军驻青海地区部队，在“三支”“两军”工作中，立下了丰功伟绩。
    青海省无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，曾经勾结部队内的个别反革命分子，掀起一股反革命复辟的逆流，疯狂镇压革命群众，并迫害青海军区司令员刘贤权同志和广大指战员。在他们的蒙蔽下，有的部队曾在“支左”工作中犯了错误。但是，由于伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，由于刘贤权同志、广大指战员和无产阶级革命派坚持不懈的斗争，很快地粉碎了反革命复辟逆流。
    在这以后，中国人民解放军驻青海地区部队广大指战员，忠实地执行毛主席的指示，大力开展了“三支”“两军”工作。他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，既坚定不移地支持革命左派，又坚定不移地团结大多数。有的单位即使只有一个“八·一八”战士，他们也大力支持，积极帮助建立和扩大组织，使“八·一八”革命组织由弱到强、由少数变为多数。解放军“支左”部队还向广大无产阶级革命派的战士大力宣传毛泽东思想，和他们一起活学活用毛主席著作，使无产阶级革命派在政治上迅速成长。
    中国人民解放军驻青海地区部队，不愧为毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导的军队，不愧为林彪副统帅亲自指挥的军队，他们在青海省两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，出色地完成着“支左”任务，成为无产阶级文化大革命的坚强柱石。
    解放军无比热爱无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派无比热爱解放军。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌。青海省军民空前的团结，是青海省取得大好革命形势的一个极为重要的因素。
    既是革命的闯将  又是团结的模范
    在白色恐怖的日子里，青海省无产阶级革命派，团结一致，并肩战斗，同生死，共患难。在胜利以后，这种团结曾经一度受到个人主义、小团体主义、山头主义、无政府主义等小资产阶级思潮的冲击，在短暂时间里出现过分裂的危险。
    革命队伍内部团结的关键在于革命组织领导成员之间的团结。正当“八·一八”等革命组织出现分裂苗头的时候，青海省革命委员会筹备小组，帮助“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会的领导成员，开展了一次小整风。大家集合在一起，学习了“老三篇”、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，正确对待人民内部的矛盾。他们按照毛主席的教导，相互坦率地交谈了意见，通过谈心，用自我批评的精神向自己头脑里的“私”字开火。一位工人出身的领导成员，以大局为重，主动说出了自己企图闹分裂的想法，表示一定改正错误，用实际行动巩固革命派内部的团结。这一次整风，推进了革命的大联合。事实证明，解决人民内部矛盾最有效的方法，就是通过整风，多作自我批评。有了自我批评的精神，便可以消除误会和分歧，统一思想，共同对敌。
    捍卫毛泽东思想  捍卫党的政策和策略
    青海“八·一八”等革命派，在青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派制造的两次白色恐怖的日子里，遭受过最残酷的镇压。
    一个严峻的考验摆在了“八·一八”等革命派的面前：怎样对待那些由于受了蒙蔽而迫害过自己的群众呢？
    在这个问题上，“八·一八”等革命派，按照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，除对少数罪大恶极的坏分子实行专政外，对受蒙蔽的广大群众和干部，实行“受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功”的政策，通过教育、争取、团结的方法，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。为了争取受蒙蔽的群众，“八·一八”等革命派战士，毫不计较个人的恩怨，以革命利益为重，主动去找过去受蒙蔽而迫害过自己的人，做政治思想工作，告诉他们，千仇万恨都记在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的头上，只要他们迅速改正错误，向敌人大杀回马枪，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，无产阶级革命派不但不会报复，而且表示欢迎。这使受蒙蔽的群众和干部受到极大的感动。
    许多革命群众组织的负责人，亲自去做受蒙蔽的群众和干部的工作，带头执行党的政策。青海省第六汽车场的“八·一八”红卫战斗队队长贾有存，在反革命复辟的白色恐怖时期，曾受到一个参加保守组织的工人的迫害。当反革命复辟逆流被粉碎以后，那位工人战战兢兢地找到贾有存承认错误。贾有存对他说：“迫害革命派的账一定要算，但不能跟你算，要算在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的头上；仇是要报的，我们报的是阶级仇，不是私仇，不能在你身上报，要向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派报。我们来自五湖四海，都是为了革命，只要你改正错误，我们就要团结起来打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。”那个工人听了这些话，感动地对着毛主席的像说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您老人家培养出了这样好的革命战士，我一定向他们学习，和他们站在一起。”事后，这个工人揭发出场内走资本主义道路当权派的许多罪行。
    “八·一八”等革命派，就是这样大公无私地执行党的政策，教育、争取、团结了广大受蒙蔽的群众和干部，把一小撮敌人最大限度地孤立起来。
    现在，青海省无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。一些革命群众组织负责人表示，尽管革命队伍内部对某些问题的看法还有分歧，但是这种分歧是能够在大批判、大斗争的高潮中顺利解决的。八月十二日，青海省建立了一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——革命的“三结合”革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众、人民解放军、革命领导干部忠诚地按照毛主席教导办事的胜利！
