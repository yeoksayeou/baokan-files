The revolutionary people led by the Burmese Communist Party in the base areas have recently held large-scale mass rallies, angrily denouncing the heinous anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese exclusion crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government, demonstrating the fighting friendship and unity between the Burmese people and the Chinese people.

In mid-July, several thousand revolutionary masses in the base areas of Tharrawaddy District led by the Burmese Communist Party held a mass rally in the Nandalin area, unanimously condemning the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government against China and Chinese people. After the rally, the revolutionary masses marched in columns near Nandalin Town, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Ne Win military government!" "The people's democratic revolution will triumph!" "Long live the Burmese Communist Party!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Thakin Than Tun!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and so on.

On July 18, the revolutionary masses in the base areas of Bago District led by the Burmese Communist Party held a mass rally in the Ebawthu area, denouncing the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese exclusion crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government. The slogans "Down with the Ne Win military government!" "Long live Chairman Thakin Than Tun!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the venue.

The Burmese Communist Party also distributed leaflets and posted notices in Yangon, Toungoo, Taungoo, and Myanaung, warning the Burmese reactionaries: "Do not persecute the Chinese residents!" In late July, the Burmese people's armed forces also executed a reactionary element who led anti-Chinese "demonstrations."
