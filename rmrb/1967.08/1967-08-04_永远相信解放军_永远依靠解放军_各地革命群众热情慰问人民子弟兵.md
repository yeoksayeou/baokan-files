On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary masses from all over the country have enthusiastically expressed their gratitude to the people's sons and daughters in arms who have established new merits in safeguarding the motherland, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from various places have firmly declared that they will always trust the PLA, always rely on the PLA, stand shoulder to shoulder with the PLA, and fight side by side with the PLA to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

"Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, who have forged a deep friendship with the PLA during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have been joyfully holding various activities to express their gratitude to the PLA in recent days. In the capital, letters of gratitude from revolutionary masses in factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools have flooded into the hands of the broad cadre and soldiers stationed in Beijing. Many art troupes and amateur performance teams have performed revolutionary model operas and art programs praising Chairman Mao's brilliant military thoughts to express their gratitude to the local troops. In Tianjin, revolutionary masses have pasted eye-catching slogans such as "Learn from the PLA, Salute the PLA!" all over the streets and alleys. Some revolutionary mass organizations have sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to perform for the army, navy, and air force stationed in Tianjin. Some revolutionary mass organizations have also sent representatives to hospitals to express their gratitude to the recuperating soldiers and to the streets to express their gratitude to the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Both the military and the people have expressed their determination to stand even more closely together in the current high tide of the revolutionary criticism and to fight the enemy together.

In Wuhan, revolutionary masses have enthusiastically expressed their gratitude to the cadre and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Wuhan in recent days. In the afternoon of the 3rd, representatives from revolutionary organizations such as "Steel Second Bureau" visited a certain military hospital to express their gratitude to the wounded and sick soldiers. A certain deputy platoon leader, a model soldier in studying Chairman Mao's works, and a battle hero, Zhou Shuping, who is currently in this hospital, has firmly supported the revolutionary leftists during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made his own contributions. When the revolutionary youngsters met him, they were extremely moved. They jointly condemned the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the army in the Wuhan region who fiercely suppressed the revolutionary masses, and resolutely declared that they would stand even more closely together to thoroughly overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Party and the army in the Wuhan region, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region to a new stage.

In recent days, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses in Jinan, Harbin, Guiyang, Hohhot, and Nanchang have also expressed their deepest feelings for the great People's Liberation Army in various forms. The preparatory committee of the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee and the Qinghai "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Alliance, in order to express the love of all ethnic groups for the PLA, organized the Qinghai Province and Xining City Ethnic People's Delegation to visit the troops' stations to express their gratitude. In these activities, revolutionary masses and cadre and soldiers have followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "supporting the army and loving the people," learning from each other, encouraging each other, and seeking each other's opinions, fully demonstrating the intimate relationship between the military and the people.

Along the vast coastal and border defense lines of the motherland, people of all ethnic groups have extensively carried out activities to express their gratitude to the PLA. Soldiers stationed on the front lines of Fujian, the border of Yunnan, and the border of Tibet have also received a large number of Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao badges, and Red Guard armbands sent from all over the country. The heroic soldiers who vigilantly guard the motherland day and night, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held the precious gifts sent by their families, tears of excitement welling up in their eyes, shouting time and time again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    各地革命群众热情慰问人民子弟兵
    军民一致表示，在当前革命大批判中，更加亲密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，把文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社三日讯　在欢庆中国人民解放军建军四十周年的日子里，全国各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众热情慰问了在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”工作中建立了新的功勋的人民子弟兵。各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众坚定地表示：要永远相信解放军，永远依靠解放军，同解放军肩并肩，心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在无产阶级文化大革命中和解放军结下了深厚友谊的北京、上海、天津的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，这两天兴高采烈地举行了各种慰问解放军的活动。在首都，工厂、农村、机关、学校的革命群众的慰问信，象雪片一样涌到驻守北京的广大指战员手里。许多文艺团体和业余演出队，演出了革命样板戏和歌颂毛主席光辉军事思想的文艺节目，热情慰问当地驻军。在天津，广大革命群众在大街小巷贴满了“向解放军学习，向解放军致敬！”等夺目的标语。有些革命群众组织派出毛泽东思想宣传队，为驻天津的陆海空三军进行了慰问演出。有些革命群众组织还派代表到医院慰问了解放军休养员，到街道慰问了烈军属。军民一致表示，在当前革命大批判的高潮中，一定要更加亲密地团结在一起，共同对敌。
    在武汉市，无产阶级革命派最近几天热情慰问了驻武汉的陆海空三军指战员。三日下午，“钢二司”等革命组织的许多代表，到某部队医院慰问了伤病员。正在这个医院里的某部副连长、学习毛主席著作积极分子、战斗英雄周述平，在无产阶级文化大革命中坚定地支持革命左派，并且作出了自己的贡献。革命小将和他见面的时候万分激动，他们一起愤怒地控诉了武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派的滔天罪行，坚决表示要更紧密地团结在一起，彻底打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个更新的阶段。
    济南、哈尔滨、贵阳、呼和浩特、南昌等地成千上万的革命群众，这几天也以各种形式向人民子弟兵表达了他们对伟大的中国人民解放军的最深厚的感情。青海省革命委员会筹备小组、青海“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会等，为了表达各族人民对解放军的无限热爱，组织了青海省、西宁市各族人民慰问团，深入部队驻地进行了慰问。在这些慰问活动中，无产阶级革命派战士和指战员们遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的教导，互相学习，互相勉励，互相征求意见，充分表现了军民亲密无间的鱼水之情。
    在祖国漫长的海防、边防线上，各族人民广泛展开了慰问解放军的活动。守卫在福建前线、云南边疆和西藏边防线上的指战员，还收到了全国各地寄来的大批毛主席著作、毛主席像章、红卫兵袖章等。日日夜夜百倍警惕地保卫着祖国、保卫着无产阶级文化大革命的英雄战士们，捧着亲人们送来的珍贵礼品，激动得热泪盈眶，一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
