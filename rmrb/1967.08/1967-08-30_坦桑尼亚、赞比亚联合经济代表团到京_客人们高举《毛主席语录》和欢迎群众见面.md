	Thousands of revolutionary masses from various sectors of the capital gathered at the Beijing airport this evening, shouting slogans such as "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people!" to warmly welcome the Tanzanian and Zambian joint economic delegation, which arrived in Beijing for a friendly visit. The delegation is led by Tanzanian Minister of Finance Jamal and Zambian Minister of State Soko.

	After stepping off the plane, the African friends were greeted by Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council and other responsible officials from relevant departments. A team of Red Guards presented the guests with red copies of the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "All the world's people should unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the world's people should have courage, dare to fight, be not afraid of difficulties and sacrifice, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be eliminated."

	The guests, holding copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," walked around the field to meet with the welcoming crowds. People held up high portraits of Chairman Mao, waved red flags, and shouted slogans: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Firmly support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

	Tanzanian Ambassador to China Mwaluko also came to the airport to welcome the delegation.
