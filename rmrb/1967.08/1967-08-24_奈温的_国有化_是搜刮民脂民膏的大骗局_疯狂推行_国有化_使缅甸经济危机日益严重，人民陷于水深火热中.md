Ne Win's reactionary government has been boasting that its implementation of "nationalization" is to establish a "socialist economic system" and "follow the socialist path of Burma." However, the facts completely expose the trickery of Ne Win's clique in their "nationalization."

Ne Win's clique's so-called "nationalization" is actually a means for the reactionary government, represented by Ne Win's clique of landlord bureaucratic comprador capitalists, to engage in plunder and seizure. Under the guise of "nationalization," they have been seizing and plundering on a grand scale, and the extent of their audacity is astonishing.

In 1963, Ne Win's clique first "nationalized" banks, rice trade, petroleum, and the forestry industry, and then issued a bandit-like "enterprise nationalization" decree, swallowing up the medium and small-scale industries of the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, including those of overseas Chinese. The following year, they further ordered the nationalization of wholesale merchants, brokers, department stores, and other businesses in Rangoon and throughout the country.

According to a report in the Burmese government newspaper *The People's Daily* on April 23, 1964, the Ne Win reactionary government had taken over more than ten thousand shops nationwide.

The Ne Win reactionary government also announced in September 1964 that the government would control the prices of thirty-four agricultural products and forcibly purchase them at low prices. In January of the following year, the Burmese reactionary government announced the so-called "unified purchase and sale" of 426 agricultural, industrial, and fishery products.

Thus, from Burma's financial and monetary system, foreign trade, industry, and transportation, to the entire urban and rural commercial channels, everything was completely controlled by the military bureaucratic comprador capitalist clique represented by Ne Win.

In the process of implementing "nationalization," the main members of Ne Win's clique amassed huge fortunes, becoming big bureaucratic comprador capitalists, each controlling and monopolizing various industries, and personally begging for aid and investment from imperialist countries. They appointed large numbers of military officers as managers and directors of "nationalized" industrial and commercial enterprises, forming a huge military bureaucratic monopoly capitalist group.

The Ne Win military clique has long relied on their military power to seize large amounts of state loans, forcibly merge private enterprises, and develop military monopoly capital. As early as 1951, they openly developed military monopoly capital under the name of the "Defense Services Corporation." The initial capital of six million kyats for this monopoly company was entirely government "loans," and many of its subsidiaries were established by merging state-owned and private enterprises. By 1958-1959, the "Defense Services Corporation" had expanded to control sixteen enterprises, including banks, shipping, domestic and foreign trade, industry, fisheries, construction, and service industries, becoming a large monopoly company.

In 1962, the "Myanmar Economic Development Corporation" (the predecessor of the "Defense Services Corporation") established by the Ne Win military clique had already become a military capitalist trust controlling thirty-two enterprises. After Ne Win's clique came to power, they merged these enterprises with the "nationalized" state-owned enterprises, expanding military bureaucratic monopoly capital.

Although the Ne Win reactionary government "nationalized" the banks and enterprises of imperialism, it not only stipulated the return of capital within three months but also continued to collude with the monopolistic capital of Western countries in fact. In recent years, the Ne Win reactionary government has increasingly relied on the United States and the Soviet revisionists, taking American military and economic "aid" and selling national interests.

At the same time, the Ne Win reactionary government has not touched a single hair of the landlord class. More than 80% of the population, who are peasants, do not have enough land or have no land at all, and they suffer from increasingly severe feudal exploitation. The so-called "socialist transformation" of agriculture is actually strengthening the reactionary rule of landlords and rich peasants and deepening the cruel exploitation of peasants.

The "nationalization" policy crazily implemented by the Ne Win reactionary government can only deepen Burma's increasingly serious economic crisis and plunge the people into a state of misery. In particular, over the past two years, Burma's industrial and agricultural production has sharply declined, and small and medium-sized industries have halted production and reduced output due to a lack of raw materials, with the number of unemployed reaching 1.8 million; the rural economy is also on the verge of collapse, with rice production reduced by one-third. In addition, "nationalization" has disrupted commercial channels, causing a severe shortage of food, oil, cloth, medicine, and other necessities, soaring prices, and rampant black markets. Burma, which was once a major rice producer, is now facing a severe famine. Ne Win's "nationalization" and "socialism" scam have been thoroughly exposed.

    奈温的“国有化”是搜刮民脂民膏的大骗局
    疯狂推行“国有化”使缅甸经济危机日益严重，人民陷于水深火热中
    本报讯　奈温反动政府一直吹嘘说，它实行的“国有化”，是要建立“社会主义经济制度”，“走缅甸的社会主义道路”。
    但是，事实完全揭穿了奈温集团的“国有化”的鬼把戏。
    奈温集团的所谓“国有化”，实际是以奈温集团为代表的地主官僚买办资产阶级政权实行巧取豪夺的一种手段。他们在“国有化”的幌子下，大肆兼并、掠夺，其猖狂的程度是十分惊人的。
    一九六三年，奈温集团先把银行、大米贸易、石油和森林工业“收归国有”，然后颁布盗匪式的“企业国有化”法令，吞并了民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的中小工商业，包括华侨的中小工商业。第二年，他们进一步下令把仰光以至全国的批发商、经纪商、百货商店等“收归国有”。
    据一九六四年四月二十三日缅甸政府报纸《劳动人民日报》报道，奈温反动政府已在全国接管了一万多家商店。
    奈温反动政府还在一九六四年九月宣布由政府管制三十四种农产品，以低价强迫收购。去年一月，缅甸反动政府又宣布对四百二十六种工农渔业产品实行所谓统购统销。
    这样，从缅甸的财政金融、对外贸易、工业和交通运输业等经济命脉，直到整个城乡商业渠道，都完全控制在以奈温集团为代表的军人官僚买办资产阶级的手里了。
    在实行“国有化”的过程中，奈温集团的主要成员大发横财，成为大官僚买办资本家，分别控制和垄断了各种行业，并亲自去帝国主义国家乞求援助和投资。他们抽调大批军官担任“收归国有”的工商企业的厂长、经理等，形成了庞大的军人官僚垄断资本集团。
    奈温军人集团早就依仗他们的军事势力，攫取大量的国家贷款，强行并吞私人企业，发展军人垄断资本。他们在一九五一年就公然以“国防军服务社”的名义，大力发展军人垄断资本。这个垄断公司最初的六十万缅元的资本，就全部是政府的“贷款”，它的许多子公司则是从兼并国营和私营企业中建立起来的。到了一九五八——一九五九年，“国防军服务社”扩展成了控制十六个企业包括银行、海运、国内外贸易、工业、渔业、建筑、服务性行业的大垄断公司。
    一九六二年，奈温军人集团成立的“缅甸经济发展公司”（“国防军服务社”是它的前身），已经是一个包括三十二个企业的军人资本托辣斯了。奈温集团上台后，又把这些企业同“收归国有”的“国营企业”合并，扩大了军人官僚垄断资本。
    奈温反动政府虽然把帝国主义的银行和企业收归“国有”，但是，不仅规定三个月内退还资本，而且事实上继续同西方各国垄断资本进行勾结。近年来，奈温反动政府更日益投靠美帝和苏修，拿美国的军事和经济“援助”，出卖民族利益。
    同时，奈温反动政府根本没有触动地主阶级的一根毫毛。占人口百分之八十以上的农民没有足够的土地或根本没有土地，他们忍受的封建剥削有加无已，所谓对农业实行“社会主义的改造”，实际上是加强地主、富农的反动统治，加深对农民的残酷剥削。
    奈温反动政府疯狂推行的这种“国有化”政策，只能加深缅甸日益严重的经济危机，使人民生活陷于水深火热之中。特别是近两年来，缅甸工农业生产急骤下降，中小工业因原料不足纷纷停工减产，失业人数曾高达一百八十万人；农村经济也日趋破产，大米产量锐减三分之一，再加上“国有化”打乱了商业渠道，以致粮食、食油、布匹、医药及其他生活必需品奇缺，物价高涨，黑市猖獗。本来是盛产大米的缅甸，现在大闹饥荒。奈温的“国有化”和“社会主义”的大骗局，已经被彻底戳穿了。
