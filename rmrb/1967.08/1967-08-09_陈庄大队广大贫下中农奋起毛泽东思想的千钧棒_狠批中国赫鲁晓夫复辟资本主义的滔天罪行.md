The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chen Zhuang Brigade, Qufu County, Shandong Province, have taken up the mighty mace of Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's evil activities of sabotaging agricultural collectivization and attempting to restore capitalism. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have further aroused their boundless hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and their boundless love for our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and for socialism.

Chen Zhuang Brigade was once a red flag in the high tide of agricultural cooperation in our country. At that time, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chen Zhuang Brigade responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize," and established a socialist agricultural cooperative in the hometown of Confucius. After three years of cooperation, grain production increased by 67 percent compared to before, greatly demonstrating the superiority of the socialist path. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the annotations to "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," praised this cooperative, saying: "Qufu County is the hometown of Confucius, ... Now the people of his hometown have established a socialist cooperative. After more than two thousand years, the people who were still so impoverished have, after three years of cooperation, begun to change the face of their economic and cultural lives. This proves that the present socialism is truly unprecedented. Socialism is far superior to Confucius' 'classics' by an unknown margin." The great leader Chairman Mao's instructions were a great encouragement to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Chen Zhuang. They believed even more firmly that only by advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao would they have a bright future.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong hated socialism to the core. In order to maliciously resist socialism, they, like all reactionaries in history, spread the "doctrines of Confucius and Mencius," attempting to put the feudal shackles back on the liberated people and drag them back to the dark old road. For this purpose, the Chinese Khrushchev, after the country's liberation, personally came to Qufu to "pay homage."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chen Zhuang firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Socialism is far superior to Confucius' 'classics' by an unknown margin." They have been engaged in a head-on struggle with the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his agents in Shandong. Especially in the current great criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chen Zhuang Brigade have, with burning indignation, severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong for their evil deeds of promoting the worship of Confucius and restoring old customs. They said, Confucius is the spokesman of the exploiting class. The doctrines of Confucius and Mencius are the guiding ideology of all exploiting classes in ruling the laboring people, so feudal emperors of all dynasties have praised Confucius as the "Great Sage and Paragon of Perfect Virtue." The Japanese fascist bandits also praised the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius, saying it is the orthodox doctrine of China. To establish the Greater East Asia Order, one must promote the "doctrines of Confucius and Mencius." The enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, also ranted: "The intention to protect the Temple of Confucius is to fundamentally uproot communism." The Chinese Khrushchev claims to be an "old revolutionary," yet he also personally came to Qufu to "pay homage," spouting nonsense, saying things like "Confucius is great," "Confucius is a sage," and so on. He also issued a black directive: "The Temple of the Confucius Family, the Temple of Confucius, and the Cemetery of Confucius must remain unchanged," and ordered them to be strictly protected. What is the Chinese Khrushchev up to? It is clear enough! His goal is to use Confucius' "classics" to oppose Chairman Mao's sacred books and socialism, to corrupt the masses, conquer their hearts, and strive to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism.

Brigade leader Chen Jinhua said: "Our ancestors have suffered greatly from Confucius' 'classics.' At that time, in our Chen Zhuang, there were 49 households, among which 21 had fled from famine and begged for food, 11 have been missing ever since, 3 sold their own children, and 9 froze or starved to death outside.... After liberation, Chairman Mao led us onto the bright road of socialism. The Chinese Khrushchev wants us to wear the spiritual shackles of the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius again, to suffer twice and endure twice the hardships. We will not agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in a million ways."

In the great criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Chen Zhuang Brigade also exposed and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to use revisionist material incentives to corrupt the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The former Shandong Provincial Party Committee's power-holders taking the capitalist road, following the Chinese Khrushchev's black directive of "material incentives are still needed," had vigorously promoted the so-called "eight-character policy" for building "new villages" in eating, wearing, living, traveling, using, culture, education, and medicine. According to this "eight-character policy," the county's power-holders taking the capitalist road said: "The procurement task can be completed as much as possible. Procurement should be as little as possible, supply as much as possible, and in arranging life, do not save those tens of thousands of jin of grain." They also promoted various "excellent member awards," "over-fulfillment awards," "breeding awards," and so on. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Their scheme is completely harmful to the country, harmful to the public, and also harmful to themselves."

In this great criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants used Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionist material incentives. They said, Chairman Mao taught us that politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all work. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev ranted, "material incentives are still needed," openly opposing the emphasis on politics and advocating material incentives. Their seven-character and eight-character slogans are all devoid of politics. They advocated various awards but did not advocate studying Chairman Mao's works. Some even said that in 1964, many poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade went to the night school organized by the commune to study Chairman Mao's works, but the power-holders taking the capitalist road obstructed them in every way. After repeated requests from everyone, they finally allowed only representatives to participate. Their promotion of material incentives and opposition to studying Chairman Mao's works resulted in the decline of righteousness and the rise of evil, and agricultural production was also greatly affected. The facts prove: material incentives, the more they are promoted, the worse they become. The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "material incentives" aims to delude us poor and lower-middle peasants into following him down the capitalist road to death. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not fall into his trap. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make our socialist new villages into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Chen Zhuang Brigade have further deepened their boundless love for Chairman Mao and socialism. During labor, they carry Chairman Mao's works and study them whenever they have time. Everyone said: "Chairman Mao supports us people of Chen Zhuang, and we people of Chen Zhuang must make Chairman Mao proud. We will raise the mighty mace of Mao Zedong Thought even higher to thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, who is undermining the foundations of socialism, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and expose and denounce him. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end."

    陈庄大队广大贫下中农奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行
    本报讯　山东省曲阜县陈庄公社陈庄大队的广大贫下中农，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫破坏农业集体化、大搞资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。通过革命的大批判，更加激起了广大贫下中农对中国的赫鲁晓夫的无比憎恨，对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和社会主义的无限热爱。
    陈庄大队曾经是我国农业合作化高潮中的一面红旗。那时候，陈庄大队的广大贫下中农坚决响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，在孔子的家乡办起了社会主义的农业合作社。办社三年，粮食就比原来增产百分之六十七，大大显示了社会主义道路的优越性。我们伟大领袖毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》的按语中，表扬这个合作社说：“曲阜县是孔夫子的故乡，……现在他的故乡的人民办起社会主义的合作社来了。经过了两千多年仍然是那样贫困的人民，办了三年合作社，经济生活和文化生活都开始改变了面貌。这就证明，现在的社会主义确实是前无古人的。社会主义比起孔夫子的
  ‘经书’来，不知道要好过多少倍。”伟大领袖毛主席的批示，对陈庄的贫下中农是极大的鼓舞，他们更加坚信，只有朝着毛主席指引的方向前进，才有无限美好的前途。
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山东的代理人，却对社会主义恨之入骨。他们为了恶毒地抵制社会主义，竟然和历史上的一切反动派一样，大肆宣扬“孔孟之道”，妄图再把那套封建枷锁重新套在解放了的人民头上，把他们再拉回到黑暗的老路上去。为了这个目的，中国的赫鲁晓夫在全国解放后曾亲自来到曲阜“朝圣”。
    陈庄的广大贫下中农牢记毛主席的教导：“社会主义比起孔夫子的‘经书’来，不知道要好过多少倍”，同党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他在山东的代理人进行针锋相对的斗争。特别是在当前的大批判中，陈庄大队的广大贫下中农，更以满腔怒火狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在山东的代理人大搞崇孔复古的罪行。他们说，孔老二是剥削阶级的代言人。孔孟之道是一切剥削阶级统治劳动人民的指导思想，所以历代的封建皇帝都把孔老二吹捧成“大成至圣先师”。日本法西斯强盗也吹捧孔孟之道，说它是中国的正统。要建立大东亚秩序，就要发扬“孔孟之道”。人民公敌蒋介石还胡说：“保护孔庙之意，为共产主义根本之铲除。”中国的赫鲁晓夫自称是
  “老革命”，可是他也亲临曲阜“朝圣”，胡言乱语，说什么“孔夫子伟大呀”，是“圣人呀”，等等。他还下黑指示：“孔府、孔庙、孔林要原封不动”，严加保护。中国的赫鲁晓夫究竟安的什么心，不是很清楚吗？他的目的就是为了用孔老二的“经书”来对抗毛主席的宝书和社会主义，用孔孟之道来腐蚀群众，征服人心，力求达到他们复辟资本主义的目的。
    大队长陈进华说：“我们祖祖辈辈饱尝了孔老二那‘经书’的苦头。那时候，我们陈庄四十九户人家，其中就有二十一户逃过荒、讨过饭，十一户至今杳无音信，三户卖了亲生儿女，有九人活活冻死、饿死在外……。解放后，毛主席领导我们走社会主义的光明大道。中国的赫鲁晓夫却想叫我们重新戴上孔孟之道的精神枷锁，吃二遍苦、受二遍罪。俺们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。”
    在大批判中，陈庄大队的贫下中农还对中国的赫鲁晓夫企图用修正主义的物质刺激来腐蚀广大贫下中农革命斗志的罪行进行了揭发、批判。旧山东省委内走资本主义道路当权派根据中国的赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激还是要一点”的黑指示，曾在这里大肆推行所谓建设“新农村”的吃、穿、住、行、用、文、学、医“八字方针”。根据这个“八字方针”，县里的走资本主义道路当权派说：“征购任务能交多少就交多少吧。征购尽量少点，供应要尽量多点，在安排生活上不要省那几万斤粮食。”他们还大搞什么“五好社员奖”、“超额奖”、“繁殖奖”等等。当时贫下中农就说：“他们搞的这一套，完全是害国家，害公家，也害了自家。”
    在这次大批判中，广大贫下中农用毛泽东思想彻底肃清了修正主义物质刺激的流毒。他们说，毛主席教导我们政治是统帅，是灵魂，是一切工作的生命线。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却胡说“物质刺激还是要一点”，明目张胆地反对突出政治，鼓吹物质挂帅。他们搞的七个字、八个字，就是唯独没有政治。他们提倡这样奖，那样奖，就是不提倡学习毛主席著作。还有的说，一九六四年俺们大队不少贫下中农去公社办的“夜校”学习毛主席著作，走资本主义道路的当权派却百般阻挠，经过大家再三要求，最后也只让派代表去参加。他们大搞物质刺激、反对学习毛主席著作的结果，使正气下降，邪气上升，农业生产也受到很大影响。事实证明：物质挂帅，越挂越坏。中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“物质刺激”的目的，就是妄图使俺们贫下中农稀里糊涂跟着他走到资本主义的死路上去。俺们贫下中农绝不上他的圈套，俺们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，使俺们社会主义的新农村成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    通过革命的大批判，陈庄大队广大贫下中农更加无限热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义。在劳动时，他们带着毛主席著作，一有空就学起来。大家说：“毛主席为俺陈庄人撑腰，俺陈庄人一定要为毛主席争气。俺们要更高地奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把挖社会主义墙脚的中国的赫鲁晓夫，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭。俺们要永远跟着毛主席革命到底。”
