Ne Win Turns the Rice Kingdom into a Land of Hunger; People Unable to Live, Rise in Revolt

Massive Anti-Hunger Struggles Erupt Across Myanmar

The Broad Masses of Workers Can Only Eat One Meal a Day, Forced to Seize Rice and Grain

New China News Agency, August 26th

Yangon News: To defend their right to live, the people of Myanmar from all walks of life are launching a massive anti-hunger movement against the criminal rule of the Ne Win reactionary government. Since July, more than thirty cities across Myanmar, including the capital Yangon, have seen mass struggles to seize rice. Anti-hunger protests and demonstrations by the people are surging in waves across the country.

Myanmar was once the world's largest exporter of rice, but now it has become a "land of hunger." This is the result of the consistent counter-revolutionary policies of anti-communism, anti-people, dictatorship, and betrayal of the country pursued by the Ne Win fascist military clique. Now, hundreds of thousands of workers in Myanmar can only eat one meal a day, and some have to forage for wild fruits to fill their stomachs. The people struggling on the brink of death have spontaneously risen up in anti-hunger struggles in many places.

The fertile Irrawaddy Delta is now the region where anti-hunger struggles are most intense. The rice-producing regions of Bago and Tharrawaddy have also seen large-scale struggles to seize rice. On July 18th, the people of Kyaunggon seized 1,500 baskets of paddy (note: one basket equals 46 pounds) from nine ships of the Ne Win reactionary government.

According to reports, the people of Bago District have organized and planned to seize rice. After learning that the Ne Win reactionary government would transport rice from Kawthaung to Yangon on August 8th, they dispatched more than 200 people in 100 small boats to ambush the route. When the government's rice transport ship passed by, the people on the small boats bravely rushed onto the ship and seized all 485 bags of rice. Before this, they also seized 96 bags of rice that the Ne Win reactionary government had confiscated in Thayet.

According to the Ne Win reactionary government's "Labor People's Daily," on August 16th, more than 1,500 people in the vicinity of Myaungmya Town in Bago District held an anti-hunger demonstration and then seized 192 bags of rice from a rice mill of the Ne Win reactionary government. More than 100 residents of Bago City gathered at the wharf early in the morning on the 15th, preventing the transport of rice to Yangon from there, and demanding that half of the rice to be transported be sold to local residents at a reasonable price.

Recently, about 200 people in Pyinmana District seized all the rice on a government ship heading to Upper Myanmar. Local residents also set up checkpoints at important intersections to intercept government rice trucks and then decide to purchase rice at the rationed price. This is because the Ne Win reactionary government implements rice rationing nationwide, with not only very low quotas but also frequent shortages. The people are forced to buy black-market rice to sustain their lives, with black-market prices several times higher than the rationed price.

In the western part of Myanmar, the city of Sittwe, where ethnic minorities reside, the people have also organized to seize rice. On August 12th and 13th, they consecutively seized two rice mills of the Ne Win government, with more than 7,000 people participating in the struggle to seize rice.

On August 15th, more than 500 farmers near Pakokku demonstrated in Pakokku Town, demanding that the government authorities supply rice. In Mawlamyine, more than 100 housewives, unable to cook without rice, held an angry protest in front of the local "Security and Administrative Committee" on the 15th. The people in Thayet, Thaton, and other places have also held anti-hunger demonstrations in recent days.

The severe food crisis has made the internal power struggles within the Ne Win reactionary regime increasingly sharp. According to a report by the "Hanthawaddy Times" on the 13th, the local authorities in Upper Myanmar do not allow vehicles to transport local rice to Yangon and other cities, and confiscate rice-transporting vehicles according to the regulated price on the spot. This newspaper revealed that the number of rice merchants going to Yangon from various places is now greatly decreasing.

The rise of the anti-hunger movement by the people across Myanmar indicates that the days of the Ne Win reactionary government are numbered. This massive people's movement, combined with the main form of struggle of the Myanmar people's revolution, the armed struggle led by the CPB with rural bases, will surely accelerate the collapse of the reactionary rule of the Ne Win fascist military clique.

### 奈温把稻米之国变成饥饿之乡　人民活不下去纷纷起来造反  缅甸全国各地爆发大规模反饥饿斗争  广大劳动人民每天只能吃一顿饭，被迫奋起抢米抢粮

    奈温把稻米之国变成饥饿之乡　人民活不下去纷纷起来造反
    缅甸全国各地爆发大规模反饥饿斗争
    广大劳动人民每天只能吃一顿饭，被迫奋起抢米抢粮
    新华社二十六日讯  仰光消息：缅甸各阶层人民群众为了维护自己的生存权利，正在掀起一个大规模的反饥饿运动，反对奈温反动政府的罪恶统治。七月份以来，缅甸全国已有三十多个城镇，包括首都仰光在内，爆发了群众抢米斗争。各地人民的反饥饿抗议示威，更是此伏彼起，接连不断。
    缅甸曾经是世界上出口大米最多的国家，如今却变成了“饥饿之乡”。这是奈温法西斯军人集团一贯推行反共、反人民、独裁、卖国的反革命政策造成的恶果。现在，缅甸成千上万的劳动人民，每天只能吃一顿饭，有的人则采野生水果充饥。挣扎在死亡线上的人民群众，在许多地方自发起来开展反饥饿斗争。
    富饶的伊洛瓦底江三角洲，现在是群众反饥饿斗争最剧烈的地区。盛产大米的勃固、沙拉瓦底等县，也都发生了大规模的抢米运动。七月十八日，恭勿倪的人民群众，一次就从奈温反动政府的九条船上，抢走一千五百箩（注：一箩折合四十六磅）稻谷。
    据报道，勃固县人民已经组织起来，有计划地进行抢米斗争。他们得知奈温反动政府将在八月八日用汽船从卡瓦镇装运大米去仰光的消息后，就派出二百多人，分乘一百只小船，在中途埋伏。当奈温反动政府的运米船经过时，各小船上的人奋勇冲了上去，把汽船上四百八十五包大米全部抢走。在此以前，他们还在宋砌镇，抢走了奈温反动政府搜刮的九十六包大米。
    据奈温反动政府的《劳动人民日报》报道，八月十六日，勃固县密觉镇附近一千五百多人举行反饥饿示威，然后到奈温反动政府的一家碾米厂，抢走一百九十二包大米。勃固市区的一百多居民，十五日清晨聚集在码头附近，不让从那里装运大米去仰光，要求把待运大米的一半，按合理价格卖给当地居民。
    最近，卑谬县约有二百多人，把奈温反动政府开往上缅甸的一艘汽船上的大米全部抢走。当地居民，还在各重要路口设置关卡，拦截政府米车，然后自行决定按配给价格购买大米。这是因为奈温反动政府在全国实行大米配给，不仅定量很低，而且时常无米供应。人民群众被迫购买黑市大米维持生活，黑市售价比配给价格高出数倍。
    缅甸西部若开市是少数民族聚居的地区，群众也已组织起来，展开抢米运动。八月十二日和十三日，他们接连抢了奈温政府的两家碾米厂，参加抢米运动的群众达七千多人。
    八月十五日，包康附近五百多农民到包康镇示威，要求政府当局供应大米。在毛淡棉市，一百多家庭妇女无米下炊，十五日在当地“安全和行政委员会”前面，举行愤怒的抗议。只光、实皆等地人民，最近几天都接连举行了反饥饿示威。
    严重的粮食危机，使奈温反动统治集团内部勾心斗角的局面日趋尖锐。据《罕礁越利报》十三日报道，上缅甸地方当局不允许车辆把当地大米运往仰光和其他城市，发现外运大米的车辆，就按规定价格就地征购。这家报纸透露，现在，从各地到仰光去的米商人数，正在大大减少。
    缅甸各地人民群众反饥饿运动的兴起，表明奈温反动政府的日子越来越不好过。这个大规模的群众运动，配合缅甸人民革命的主要斗争形式，由缅共领导的以农村为根据地的武装斗争的发展，必将加速奈温法西斯军人集团反动统治的灭亡。
