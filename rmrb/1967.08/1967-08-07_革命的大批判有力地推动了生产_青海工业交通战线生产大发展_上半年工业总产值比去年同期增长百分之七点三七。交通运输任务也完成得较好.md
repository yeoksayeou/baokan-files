In the midst of the resounding victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and amidst the high tide of a comprehensive criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Qinghai, good news of a great leap forward in production has come from the industrial and transportation fronts in Qinghai Province.

In the first half of this year, the province's total industrial output value increased by 7.37 percent compared to the same period last year. Especially since the second quarter, when the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction gained absolute superiority, industrial production has been surging ahead, with each month better than the last. The province's total industrial output value in the second quarter increased by 40.4 percent compared to the first quarter. The quantity and quality of products have significantly improved, and costs have been reduced. Transportation tasks have also been completed relatively well.

In the first quarter of this year, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee incited workers to fight against workers and deceived workers to leave their production posts, causing some factories and mines to fail to complete their production plans. Since May, the proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial and transportation fronts in Qinghai Province have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching a comprehensive exposure, denunciation, criticism, and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Qinghai. During the criticism, they thoroughly smashed the capitalist and revisionist rules and regulations in enterprise management, thoroughly smashed the rules and taboos that bind and suppress workers, and firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, using politics to command production, thereby unleashing the initiative of the workers. Therefore, the province's industrial output value in May reached the highest level since September of last year.

The August 18th proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial and transportation fronts in Qinghai Province, in the midst of the criticism, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. They put revolutionary interests first, actively sought to unite and win over the deceived masses, and boldly liberated cadres who had made mistakes but were willing to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the same time, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, they successfully achieved revolutionary great unity throughout the province's industrial and transportation system. Currently, more than 70 percent of the workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Qinghai Province have joined revolutionary organizations, and 96 percent of the enterprise units have established new production command systems with revolutionary order and authority. In June, the province's total industrial output value increased by 21.74 percent compared to the high-production month of May, creating a new level in Qinghai's industrial production history that has never been seen before.

    革命的大批判有力地推动了生产
    青海工业交通战线生产大发展
    上半年工业总产值比去年同期增长百分之七点三七。交通运输任务也完成得较好
    据新华社西宁五日电　在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人展开全面大批判的高潮中，青海省工业交通战线传来了生产大发展的喜讯。
    今年上半年，全省工业总产值比去年同期增长百分之七点三七。特别是从第二季度“八·一八”无产阶级革命派占绝对优势以来，工业生产蒸蒸日上，一月比一月好。第二季度全省工业总产值比第一季度增长了百分之四十点四，产品的产量和质量都显著提高，成本有所降低。交通运输任务也完成得比较好。
    今年第一季度，青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动工人斗工人，煽动受蒙蔽的职工离开生产岗位，使得一些厂矿一直没有完成生产计划。五月份以来，青海省工交战线上的无产阶级革命派，高举革命的批判旗帜，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人展开了全面的大揭露、大控诉、大批判、大斗争。在大批判中，他们大破企业经营管理上资本主义、修正主义的规章制度，大破束缚和压制工人的清规戒律，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，用政治统帅生产，使工人的积极性得到发挥。因此，全省五月份完成的工业总产值达到了去年九月份以来的最高水平。
    青海省工交战线上的“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，在大批判中紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握了斗争的大方向。他们以革命利益为重，主动争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众，大胆解放犯有错误而愿意回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的干部。同时，在毛泽东思想的基础上，胜利地实现了全省工交系统的革命大联合。目前，青海省工交战线上的职工已有百分之七十多参加了革命组织，百分之九十六的企业单位建立起了新的有革命秩序和权威的生产指挥系统。六月份全省工业总产值比高产的五月份又提高百分之二十一点七四，创造了青海工业生产史上从未有过的新水平。
