		Johnson's Memorandum Exposes the Adventurousness and Weakness of U.S. Imperialism
		Announces Continued Troop Increase in South Vietnam and Increased Military Spending; Laments "Still Have to Pay a Price, Suffer Losses"

		According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, Washington: The Johnson administration of the United States, which is increasingly mired in the Vietnam War and has no way out, announced on the 3rd that it will continue to send more troops to South Vietnam and increase military spending, attempting to continue military adventurism on the battlefield in Vietnam.

		On the 3rd, U.S. President Johnson submitted a "Memorandum on the Budget and Economic Situation" to the U.S. Congress, announcing that by June 30 of next year, the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam will be "increased by at least 45,000," reaching a total of 525,000. At the same time, an additional 40 billion dollars will be added to the military budget, making the military spending for the 1967-1968 fiscal year, which ends on June 30, reach 800 billion dollars.

		On the one hand, this memorandum shows that U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept defeat in South Vietnam and will continue down the dangerous path of escalating the war. On the other hand, the materials and figures listed in the memorandum, as well as its gloomy tone, once again reflect that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, a hollow shell. A small war of aggression in Vietnam has already exhausted and embarrassed this seemingly formidable "giant."

		Johnson proposed this memorandum to request Congress to approve increased taxation to address the government's enormous fiscal difficulties. He admitted that the fiscal deficit for the 1967-1968 fiscal year may surge from the estimated 80 billion dollars to 230-280 billion dollars, setting a record since the end of World War II.

		He admitted that such a huge fiscal deficit would pose "obvious and real dangers" to the U.S. economy, which is in a state of false prosperity and cannot withstand the slightest disturbance. To cope with this situation, he requested Congress to agree to levy an additional 10% surtax on corporate income tax and personal income tax.

		One of the fundamental causes of the current fiscal difficulties in the United States is that U.S. imperialism cannot fill the bottomless pit of the Vietnam War. According to official figures, the annual U.S. military spending in Vietnam is as high as 25 billion dollars, or approximately 70 million dollars per day. Further troop increases and war escalation will inevitably increase war expenses, making it even more difficult for the United States to escape its fiscally strapped predicament.

		Facing this predicament, Johnson lamented in his memorandum, "I wish I could report to you that the conflict in Vietnam is almost over. But I cannot. The situation we face is that we still have to pay a price, still have to suffer losses, still have to suffer pain."

    约翰逊咨文暴露美帝冒险性和虚弱性
    宣布继续增兵南越增加军费  哀叹“还要付出代价，遭受损失”
    据新华社四日讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越战争的泥潭中越陷越深、走投无路的美国约翰逊政府，三日宣布还要向南越增兵和增加军费，企图在越南战场上继续进行军事冒险。
    美国总统约翰逊三日向美国国会提出一项“关于预算和经济状况的咨文”，宣布将在明年六月三十日以前，把侵越美军“至少再增加四万五千人”，即增加到五十二万五千人；同时，再增加军费四十亿美元，使到明年六月三十日为止的一九六七——六八财政年度的军费高达八百亿美元。
    这个咨文一方面表明美帝国主义决不甘心它在南越的失败，还要沿着扩大战争的危险道路继续走下去；另一方面，咨文列举的材料、数字及低沉的语调再次反映出，美帝国主义是一只不折不扣的外强中干的纸老虎，一场小小的侵越战争，已经把这个貌似惊人的“庞然大物”拖得精疲力竭、狼狈不堪。
    约翰逊提出这个咨文，是为了要求国会批准继续增税来解决政府面临的巨大的财政困难。他承认，在一九六七——六八财政年度内，财政赤字可能由预计的八十亿美元猛增到二百三四十亿，甚至二百八九十亿美元，创造第二次世界大战结束以来的最高纪录。
    他承认，出现这样巨额的财政赤字，将对处于虚假繁荣状态、经不起风吹草动的美国经济，产生“明显的和现实的危险”。为了应付这一局势，他要求国会同意在征收公司利得税和个人所得税时，加征相当于税额百分之十的附加税。
    造成美国目前财政困难的根本原因之一是美帝国主义填补不了侵越战争这样一个无底洞。据官方数字，美国侵越军费每年高达二百五十亿美元，即平均每天约七千万美元。进一步增兵和扩大战争，势将进一步增加战费，这就使得美国更加无法摆脱它财政上捉襟见肘的困难处境。
    面临着这一困境，约翰逊在咨文中沮丧地说：“但愿我能够向你们报告越南冲突差不多快要结束了。但是这一点我做不到。我们面临的局面是还要付出代价，还要遭受损失，还要遭受痛苦。”
