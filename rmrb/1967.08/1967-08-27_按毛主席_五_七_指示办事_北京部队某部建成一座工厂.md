After Chairman Mao issued the "May 7th" directive, the Beijing Military Region's certain unit completed the construction of a military-run factory—"Military Chemical" Fertilizer Plant—and it has recently been put into formal production.

On August 21st, the certain unit of the Beijing Military Region solemnly held an opening ceremony for the "Military Chemical" Fertilizer Plant. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers, filled with the joy of victory and the revolutionary fervor of being good students of Mao Zedong Thought, celebrated the great achievements in implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive and hailed another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrades from the General Logistics Department, as well as relevant responsible comrades from the Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan Military Regions, and the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, attended the ceremony to offer warm congratulations.

This medium-sized fertilizer plant, with an annual production capacity of 3,000 tons of synthetic ammonia, was built in response to the great call by the great leader Chairman Mao that "the army should be a big school." The construction began five months ago. The plant was designed, constructed, and put into production all within the same year, with fast construction speed, minimal investment, and good quality in both engineering and products.

During the construction of the "Military Chemical" Fertilizer Plant, they received strong support from the revolutionary masses of Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces and municipalities.

    这座年产三千吨合成氨的中型化肥厂，是北京部队某部响应伟大领袖毛主席“解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，在五个月前动工兴建的。这座工厂，当年设计，当年施工，当年投产，建设速度快，投资少，工程和产品质量良好。
    在“军工”化肥厂的建设过程中，他们得到了北京、上海、山西、河北等省市的无产阶级革命派的大力支援。
