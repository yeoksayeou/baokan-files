	Revolutionary Mount Pupan
	Song of the Thai Guerrilla Fighters

	Lofty Mount Pupan, towering into the clouds,
	Majestic and grand, stretching far and wide.
	Oh, Mount Pupan—you are the glory of Thailand.
	The flag of revolutionary victory,
	Facing the storm, proudly waves on Mount Pupan.
	The torch of the times, like the rising sun,
	Guides victory to victory.

	The warriors of Mount Pupan,
	The sons and daughters of the people,
	Cutting through thickets, crossing mountains,
	Climbing steep peaks and dangerous heights.
	For the people, they sacrifice their lives,
	Spilling their blood, brave and steadfast.
	The roar of cannons shakes the four directions,
	Gunfire and bullets are mere trifles.
	In the people’s war, everyone is a hero,
	Fearless of danger, undaunted by hardship.
	Everyone stands tall like Mount Pupan,
	The victory of war belongs to the people,
	The revolutionary fire surges across the heavens.
	On Mount Pupan, the red flag is brilliant,
	Fluttering in the wind, welcoming the battle.

    革命的普潘山
    泰国游击战士之歌巍巍普潘山，高耸入云天，崴嵬又雄伟，纵横且延绵。啊，普潘山——你是泰国的光荣。革命的胜利的旗帜，迎着风暴，昂然飘扬在普潘山。时代的火炬如旭日，引导胜利走向胜利。普潘山的战士，人民的子弟兵，披荆斩棘穿密林，翻山越岭攀险峰。为人民，抛头颅，洒热血，英勇坚贞。炮声怒吼撼四方，枪林弹雨只等闲。人民战争，个个逞英豪，不怕危险，不畏艰难。人人屹立如普潘，战争胜利属人民，革命热火冲河汉。普潘山上红旗艳，飒飒飘扬迎战酣。注：普潘山位于泰国东北部，是人民武装的活动地区。
