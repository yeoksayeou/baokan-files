The People's Liberation Army of China has been in existence for forty years.

In the past forty years, under the cultivation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made tremendous contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.

In the past forty years, under the cultivation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the militia has grown and advanced, achieving brilliant victories.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is now sweeping across the country with unprecedented vigor. This unprecedented revolution is a decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a decisive battle between socialism and capitalism, a decisive battle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. Under such circumstances, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, militia cadres and the broad masses of militia must recognize their glorious historical mission. We must stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and, together with the broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly purge their poison politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the construction of the militia, there has always been a sharp struggle between two lines. One is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the other is the bourgeois reactionary line. This reactionary line must be thoroughly criticized.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has most fully and profoundly expounded the importance of arming the masses. As early as March 1927, in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," Chairman Mao put forward the brilliant proposition: "Overthrow the landlord armed forces and establish peasant armed forces." Chairman Mao pointed out: "The peasant armed forces are a new armed force that makes all the local tyrants and evil gentry tremble," and "every young and strong peasant should have a spear, and it should not be restricted." Chairman Mao sharply criticized the right-opportunists at that time who were opposed to arming the peasants and were "scared off" by the "spear corps." The Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao, which has epoch-making significance, is the great practice and development of this great theory.

The first armed force of workers and peasants established by Chairman Mao's leadership of the Autumn Harvest Uprising marched to Jinggangshan, creating the first revolutionary base area, and opening up a new path for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Chairman Mao summed up the experience of the Jinggangshan struggle and pointed out: "The Red Army must do its utmost to help the people arm themselves."

Chairman Mao sharply criticized the right-opportunist line that opposed the masses possessing arms. In every revolutionary war, Chairman Mao taught us: "The guerrilla warfare of the people, from the perspective of the entire revolutionary war, is the left hand of the main force Red Army. Without the guerrilla warfare of the people, it is like a one-armed general. The conditions of the people in the base areas, specifically speaking, especially for combat, are that the people have armed themselves. The enemy regards it as a difficult path, mainly because of this point." "The people are the foundation of victory." "The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the masses." "In the liberated areas of China, all young and middle-aged men and women, on the principle of voluntary, democratic, and non-detachment from production, are organized into the Anti-Japanese People's Self-Defense Corps. The elite of the Self-Defense Corps, in addition to those who join the army and guerrilla units, are organized into the militia. Without the cooperation of these mass armed forces, it is impossible to defeat the enemy."

Since the founding of the nation, the struggle between the two lines in militia construction has continued to be sharp and intense.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The imperialists are bullying us like this, and this needs to be dealt with seriously. We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish large numbers of militia divisions. In this way, when the imperialists invade our country, they will find it difficult to move an inch." "Our broad laboring people welcome the militia system ... If the imperialists dare to launch an invasion war against our country, then we will realize the mobilization of the entire people, and the militia will cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and at any time supplement the People's Liberation Army, to thoroughly defeat the invaders." "Militia work must be implemented in terms of organization, politics, and military affairs." "To carry out the Four Clean-ups, the militia must be strengthened."

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, our deputy commander Lin Biao, most loyally and thoroughly implements Chairman Mao's correct line, and most resolutely and bravely defends Chairman Mao's correct line. In militia construction, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: Militia work is a fundamental issue in our national defense construction, an important component of strategic issues, and a specific application of the Party's mass line in war. Combining the construction of a modernized revolutionary army with the establishment of large numbers of militia divisions is the policy of "walking on two legs" in national defense construction, and is a major development of Chairman Mao's people's war thought under modern conditions.

However, a small handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road have used every means to interfere with, resist, and oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, promoting the bourgeois reactionary line. They regard the militia organized according to Mao Zedong Thought as a major obstacle to their usurpation of the Party, the army, and the government, and to their realization of the restoration of capitalism. They either directly oppose arming the masses and establishing large numbers of militia, or in militia construction, they promote a purely military viewpoint, oppose emphasizing politics, and attempt to transform the militia into a tool for them to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and realize their personal ambitions. The head of the anti-Party clique exposed at the 1959 Lushan Conference, Peng Dehuai, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Lu Rong, who was exposed on the eve of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are representative figures of these people.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines in militia work has taken on new forms and is extremely sharp and intense.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left. The editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine in 1967, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, proposes: "From top to bottom, in all units that need to seize power, military representatives or militia representatives should participate, forming a 'three-in-one combination.' Military representatives should be sent to the county level and above, and militia representatives should be sent to the commune level and below. This is very good."

The broad masses of militia cadres and militia enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively support the broad masses of the left, participate in the great criticism of the revolution, promote the great unity of the revolution, do a good job of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and have achieved great results.

However, it must be seen that the small handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, in order to save themselves, are using deceitful, fraudulent, coercive, and inciting methods, attempting to pull some militia cadres and militia to the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, becoming tools to protect themselves and promote the bourgeois reactionary line. They attempt to use the militia to arrest people, beat people, and detain people, inciting the militia to participate in armed struggles. They attempt to incite rural militia to enter cities, suppressing the proletarian revolutionary forces in cities. They even attempt to instruct the militia to sabotage production, disrupt transportation, and disrupt social order. The plots of these scoundrels are doomed to fail.

All revolutionary militia cadres and all revolutionary militia must keep their eyes open, heighten their vigilance, and not be deceived; they must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and thoroughly smash the evil plots of a small handful of scoundrels using the militia to promote the bourgeois reactionary line and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The various provincial military regions, military sub-regions, county (city) military departments, and militia cadres at all levels must guide the broad masses of militia to stand in line, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To do this, they must first stand in line themselves, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must stand on the proletarian standpoint, draw a clear line with the small handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, and no matter how familiar they were with them in the past, they must be impartial and fearless, and together with the revolutionary masses, expose them and overthrow them.

They must be good at distinguishing the left, loving the left, and actively supporting the left. For mass organizations, one must look at their direction of struggle and their mainstream. Those who resolutely fight against the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fight against the bourgeois reactionary line, and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must firmly support them, unite with them, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. For the masses who have been deceived, one must do detailed ideological work and patiently win them back to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If the leftist work is not done well for a while and the wrong person is supported, one must publicly admit the mistake and correct it immediately, the sooner the better. If one insists on the mistake and continues down the wrong path, it is very dangerous.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." It is necessary to conduct education among militia cadres and the broad masses of militia on Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles regarding the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, conduct education on the struggle between the two lines, and carry out the great criticism movement, so that everyone deeply understands the great significance of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely follows Chairman Mao, and keeps up with the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao points out: "Regarding the instructions of the superior leadership, 'not to discuss and examine according to the actual situation, blindly execute based on the 'superior' concept, this kind of formalistic attitude based solely on the 'superior' concept is very wrong.' 'Wrong leadership that harms the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted, but should be resolutely resisted.'" We militia cadres and militia should remember Chairman Mao's teaching. For leadership that implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must resolutely support and support it, "come when called." For leadership that implements the bourgeois reactionary line, we must resolutely oppose it, resolutely resist it, and resolutely rebel against it.

Currently, the most important thing in militia work is to educate militia cadres and the broad masses of militia to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and actively participate in and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must not allow the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to lure militia cadres and militia to the wrong path of the bourgeois reactionary line. This is the top priority in current militia work and the biggest political issue in current militia work.

Militia cadres and comrades, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely follow the commands of our great commander Chairman Mao and deputy commander Lin Biao, resolutely support the Party Central Committee, resolutely support the Central Military Commission, resolutely support the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve new victories for the people!

    民兵要最坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边
    ——《解放军报》民兵专刊“八一”社论
    中国人民解放军诞生四十周年了。
    四十年来，在伟大领袖毛主席的培育和领导下，中国人民解放军为中国人民的革命事业立下了丰功伟绩。
    四十年来，我们民兵在伟大领袖毛主席的培育和领导下，在人民解放军的帮助下，成长壮大，奋勇前进，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在全国范围内轰轰烈烈进行着。这场史无前例的大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的大决战，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大决战，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线两条路线的大决战。在这样的形势下，纪念人民解放军建军四十周年，民兵工作干部和广大民兵，要认清自己的光荣的历史任务。我们必须最坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和广大的无产阶级革命派一道，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底肃清他们的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在民兵建设上，历来存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。一条是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一条是资产阶级反动路线。对这条反动路线，必须彻底批判。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席最充分最深刻地阐明了武装群众的重要性。早在一九二七年三月写的《湖南农民运动考察报告》中，毛主席就英明地提出：要“推翻地主武装，建立农民武装”。毛主席指出：农民武装“是使一切土豪劣绅看了打颤的一种新起的武装力量”，“应使每个青年壮年农民都有一柄梭镖，而不应限制它”。毛主席尖锐地批判了当时反对武装农民，被“梭镖队”“吓翻了”的右倾机会主义者。毛主席领导的具有划时代意义的秋收起义，就是这一伟大理论的伟大实践和发展。
    毛主席领导秋收起义所建立的第一支工农武装，进军井冈山，创建了第一个革命根据地，为中国革命和世界革命开创了一条崭新的道路。毛主席总结了井冈山斗争的经验，指出：红军“必须尽量帮助人民武装起来”。
    毛主席尖锐地批判了那种反对群众掌握武装的右倾机会主义路线。在历次革命战争中，毛主席教导我们：“人民的游击战争，从整个革命战争的观点看来，和主力红军是互为左右手，只有主力红军而无人民的游击战争，就象一个独臂将军。根据地的人民条件，具体地说来，特别是对于作战说来，就是有武装起来了的人民。敌人视为畏途，主要地也在这一点。”“兵民是胜利之本”。“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”“在中国解放区内，一切青年、壮年的男人和女人，都在自愿的民主的和不脱离生产的原则下，组织在抗日人民自卫军之中。自卫军中的精干分子，除加入军队和游击队者外，则组织在民兵的队伍中。没有这些群众武装力量的配合，要战胜敌人是不可能的。”
    建国以来，民兵建设上的两条路线的斗争，继续尖锐地激烈地进行着。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”“我们的广大劳动人民对于民兵制度是喜闻乐见的，……帝国主义如果竟敢发动对我国的侵略战争，那时我们就将实现全民皆兵，民兵就将配合人民解放军，并且随时补充人民解放军，彻底打败侵略者。”“民兵工作要做到组织落实、政治落实、军事落实”。“搞四清，要把民兵搞好。”
    毛主席的亲密战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志，最忠实、最彻底地执行毛主席的正确路线，最坚决、最英勇地捍卫毛主席的正确路线。在民兵建设上，林彪同志指出：民兵工作是我国国防建设的一个根本性问题，是战略问题的一个重要组成部分，是党的群众路线在战争上的具体运用。把建设现代化革命军队和大办民兵师结合起来，这是“两条腿走路”的方针在国防建设上的具体运用，是毛主席人民战争思想在现代条件下的重大发展。
    但是，党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计地干扰、抵制、对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行资产阶级反动路线。他们把按照毛泽东思想组织起来的民兵，看成是他们篡党、篡军、篡政，实现资本主义复辟的一个大障碍。他们或者是直接反对武装群众，反对大办民兵；或者是在民兵建设中搞单纯军事观点，反对突出政治，妄图按照资产阶级的面貌来改造民兵，妄图使民兵成为他们推行反革命修正主义路线，实现个人野心的工具。一九五九年庐山会议所揭露出来的反党集团的头子彭德怀，和在无产阶级文化大革命前夕被揭发出来的反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，就是这一小撮人中的代表人物。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，民兵工作中的两条路线斗争，又以新的形式表现出来，而且十分尖锐，十分激烈。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期社论根据毛主席的指示提出：从上至下，凡要夺权的单位，都要有军队代表或民兵代表参加，组成“三结合”。县以上都派军队代表，公社以下都派民兵代表，这是非常之好的。
    广大民兵工作干部和广大民兵，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，积极支持左派广大群众，参加革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合，搞好革命的“三结合”，抓革命，促生产、促工作、促战备，做出了很大的成绩。
    但是，必须看到，党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了挽救他们的死亡，正采取蒙蔽、欺骗、胁迫、煽动等恶毒手段，妄图把某些民兵工作干部和民兵拉到资产阶级反动路线方面去，成为保护他们自己和他们推行资产阶级反动路线的工具。他们企图利用民兵抓人，打人，关押人，挑动民兵参加武斗。他们企图煽动农村民兵进城，压制城市里面的无产阶级革命派。他们甚至企图指使民兵去破坏生产，破坏交通，破坏社会秩序。这些家伙的阴谋，是注定要破产的。
    一切革命的民兵工作干部，一切革命的民兵，都应该擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，不要上当；要无限忠于毛主席，最坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底粉碎一小撮坏家伙利用民兵推行资产阶级反动路线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋。
    各省军区、军分区、县（市）武装部和各级民兵工作干部，必须引导广大民兵站好队，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。要做到这一点，首先自己必须站好队，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。要站稳无产阶级立场，和党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底划清界限，不管自己过去和他们多么熟悉，都要大公无私，不讲情面，坚决和革命群众一道把他们揪出来，把他们打倒。
    要善于识别左派，要热爱左派，积极支持左派。对群众组织，必须看他们的斗争大方向，看他们的主流。凡是坚决地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，向资产阶级反动路线作斗争，站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的，我们就要坚决给予支持，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。对受蒙蔽的群众，要做细致的思想工作，耐心地争取他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。支左工作如果一时做得不好，支持错了，就要公开认错，坚决改正，改了就好了，改正得越快越好。如果坚持错误不改，一直沿着错误路线走下去，则是很危险的。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”必须在民兵工作干部和广大民兵中，进行毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的教育，进行两条路线斗争的教育，开展革命的大批判运动，使大家深刻理解当前这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，紧紧跟上毛主席，跟上无产阶级文化大革命的形势。
    毛主席指出：对于上级领导机关的指示，“不根据实际情况进行讨论和审察，一味盲目执行，这种单纯建立在‘上级’观念上的形式主义的态度是很不对的。”“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”我们民兵工作干部和民兵应当牢记毛主席的这个教导。凡是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的领导，我们就要坚决拥护，坚决支持，“召之即来”。凡是执行资产阶级反动路线的领导，我们就要坚决反对，坚决抵制，坚决造他们的反。
    当前民兵工作，最重要的是要教育各级民兵工作干部和广大民兵最坚定地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，积极地参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命。我们决不能让党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把民兵工作干部和民兵诱骗到资产阶级反动路线的邪路上去。这是当前民兵工作的头等大事，是当前民兵工作中的最大的政治。
    民兵工作干部和民兵同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远忠于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，坚决听从我们伟大统帅毛主席和副统帅林彪副主席的指挥，坚决拥护党中央，坚决拥护中央军委，坚决拥护中央文革，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功！
