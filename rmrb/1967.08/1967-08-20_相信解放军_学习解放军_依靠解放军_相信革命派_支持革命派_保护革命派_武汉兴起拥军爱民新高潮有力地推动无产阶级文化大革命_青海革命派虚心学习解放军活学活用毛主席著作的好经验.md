A new wave of supporting the army and loving the people is surging in Wuhan, powerfully promoting the new upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In this new wave of supporting the army and loving the people, the image of the great People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has become even more towering in the hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. The image of the heroic proletarian revolutionaries who have created immortal achievements in the Cultural Revolution has also become more respected and beloved in the hearts of the broad cadres and fighters of the Wuhan garrison.

The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan say: Without the People's Liberation Army, we proletarian revolutionaries would have nothing. We proletarian revolutionaries love the PLA, support the PLA, learn from the PLA, firmly believe in the PLA, and rely on the PLA! The local garrison cadres and fighters say: The revolutionary mass movement guided by Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress. Wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary faction and protecting the revolutionary faction is to protect Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We revolutionary soldiers must believe in the leftists, learn from the leftists, support the leftists, and protect the leftists!

Revolutionary mass organizations such as "Gangongzong," "Gangershi," "Gangjiuyisan," "Xinhuagong," "Xinhudada," "Xinhuanong," and "Sanshigelian" have all made decisions or issued notices to support the army. Some have even sent propaganda teams to widely propagate the great significance of supporting the army and loving the people. Many units of the Wuhan garrison have also made decisions to love the people. The plans for supporting the army and loving the people in many units are becoming the conscious actions of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians.

The appearance of this new situation of supporting the army and loving the people is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a great victory of the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The supporting the army and loving the people activities currently being vigorously carried out in Wuhan, with military-civilian unity and joint revolutionary criticism as the center, have a series of new contents. These new contents mainly include: military and civilians jointly carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, swearing to deeply and thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, politically, ideologically, and theoretically; jointly studying Chairman Mao's works with problems encountered in the practice of the Cultural Revolution, holding lectures and exchanging learning experiences; jointly "grasp revolution, promote production," fighting by the steel furnace and laboring in the fields. The soldiers of the Wuhan Steel Company's "Gangjiuyisan" have summarized these activities that the military and civilians jointly carry out into one sentence: "Thousands of joint efforts, tens of thousands of joint efforts, the most fundamental is that the military and civilians jointly respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In the revolutionary criticism movement, the more they criticize, the more they hate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, the more they love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the closer the relationship between the military and civilians becomes, and the more intense the revolutionary criticism fire becomes. The cadres and fighters of the 8199, 7212, and 7252 units on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" have recently held many joint criticism meetings with the local proletarian revolutionaries.

Many units' cadres and fighters and proletarian revolutionary fighters have also carried out activities of jointly reading Chairman Mao's works every day, exchanging combat experiences, and having heart-to-heart talks, making the relationship between the army and the revolutionary masses even closer. The proletarian revolutionaries of "Xinhudada" have made two decisions to support the army and have held many military-civilian symposiums with the cadres and fighters of the supporting-left units, exchanging opinions, introducing and exchanging combat experiences, encouraging and promoting each other, and recently jointly launching a broad and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement, further strengthening the unity within the revolutionary faction and making the military-civilian relationship even closer.

In many factories and suburban people's communes in Wuhan, the garrison and the proletarian revolutionaries jointly grasp revolution and promote production, participating in production labor together, which has become an important part of the supporting the army and loving the people activities.

What is the greatest support for the army? The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan answer well: Firmly believe in the PLA, learn from the PLA, rely on the PLA, and unite closely with the broad cadres and fighters to overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, this is the greatest support for the army. What is the greatest love for the people? The broad cadres and fighters of the Wuhan garrison answer well: Hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the proletarian revolutionary faction, wholeheartedly protect the proletarian revolutionary faction, rely closely on the proletarian revolutionary faction, and create new achievements for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this is the greatest love for the people. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians say this and do this. Now, the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Wuhan are rapidly expanding. The unity among various revolutionary mass organizations with a revolutionary friendship of sharing weal and woe is further strengthened. The military and civilians in Wuhan are united, jointly fighting against the enemy, encircling and annihilating the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, and the class enemies have been completely isolated, falling into the vast ocean of the people's struggle.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 17th: The proletarian revolutionary faction of August 18th in Qinghai Province, under the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," believes in the PLA, relies on the PLA, takes the PLA as an example, humbly learns from the PLA's good experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promotes the ideological revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and promotes the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The garrison units in Qinghai Province have sent hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams (groups) to factories, rural areas, pastoral areas, offices, and schools at the grassroots level during the "three supports, two militaries," vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

They stand firmly, hold high the banner, and unambiguously support the proletarian revolutionary faction of August 18th in Qinghai Province, receiving warm praise from the proletarian revolutionary faction. The proletarian revolutionary faction calls the PLA the relatives sent by Chairman Mao and the good sons and daughters of the people.

In the joint struggle with the broad cadres and fighters of the garrison, the proletarian revolutionary faction of August 18th in Qinghai Province has further realized that the PLA holds the highest banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has the best ideological revolutionization, and is the best example for us to learn from. Therefore, they seriously learn from the PLA, invite the cadres and fighters of the PLA to introduce the experience of the PLA in holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the four firsts, and doing a good job in ideological revolutionization, and further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the class struggle.

Currently, a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging in various places in Qinghai. Many units put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first, greatest, highest, and most important position, establishing an unbreakable learning system. Various systems and departments of revolutionary mass organizations, whether holding meetings to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their agents in Qinghai, or solving various problems in work, first study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the direction of revolution and work.

In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, the proletarian revolutionary faction of August 18th especially pays attention to learning from the PLA's good experience of studying with problems, applying actively, and working hard on the "use." They start from the needs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution struggle, purposefully consult Chairman Mao's works. They do as Chairman Mao says, firmly grasp the grand direction of the struggle, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, and relentlessly pursue and attack the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their agents in Qinghai.

Currently, a new wave of supporting the army and loving the people activities has emerged in Qinghai Province. The proletarian revolutionary faction of August 18th regards firmly believing in the PLA, relying on the PLA, and learning from the PLA as the greatest support for the army. The garrison cadres and fighters also regard spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary faction as the greatest love for the people. The military and civilians stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, jointly take Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, concentrate firepower, verbally and in writing condemn, launch a new wave of great struggle and great criticism.

    武汉兴起拥军爱民新高潮有力地推动无产阶级文化大革命
    青海革命派虚心学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的好经验
    据新华社武汉十七日电　一个拥军爱民活动的新高潮，正在武汉地区蓬蓬勃勃兴起，有力地推动着无产阶级文化大革命的新高涨。
    在拥军爱民的新高潮中，毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民解放军的形象，在武汉地区无产阶级革命派心目中更加高大了；在文化大革命中创立了不朽功勋的英勇的无产阶级革命派的形象，在武汉驻军广大指战员的心目中，也更加可敬可亲了。
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派说：没有人民解放军，就没有我们无产阶级革命派的一切。我们无产阶级革命派就是热爱解放军，拥护解放军，学习解放军，坚信解放军，依靠解放军！当地驻军指战员说：毛泽东思想指引的革命群众运动，是历史前进的火车头。全心全意地支持革命派，保卫革命派，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们革命战士就是要相信左派，学习左派，支持左派，保护左派！
    “钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命群众组织分别专门作出了拥军的决定或发出了拥军的通知，有的还派出宣传队，广泛宣传拥军爱民的伟大意义。武汉驻军许多部队也分别专门作出了爱民的决定。许多单位的拥军爱民活动计划，正在越来越广泛地成为广大军民的自觉行动。
    这种拥军爱民的崭新局面的出现，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    武汉地区正在轰轰烈烈开展的拥军爱民活动，以军民团结，共同展开革命的大批判为中心，有着一系列崭新的内容。这些新内容主要是：军民共同开展革命的大批判、大斗争，誓把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭；共同带着文化大革命斗争实践中碰到的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，一起举行讲用会，交流学习体会；共同“抓革命，促生产”，战斗在炼钢炉旁，劳动在田野里。武汉钢铁公司“钢九一三”的战士们把这些军民一起进行的活动概括成一句话：“千共同，万共同，最根本的是军民共同响应林副主席的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”在革命的大批判运动中，大家越批判，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派越痛恨，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越热爱，军民之间的关系越亲密无间，革命大批判的火力越加猛烈。在“三支”“两军”第一线的八一九九部队、七二一二部队、七二五二部队的指战员们，最近分别同驻地的无产阶级革命派一起，举行了许多次批判大会。
    许多部队的指战员和无产阶级革命派战士，还开展了共同天天读毛主席著作、互相交流斗争经验、互相谈心的活动，使军队和革命群众之间的关系更加密切。“新湖大”的无产阶级革命派，曾两次作出拥军决定，并和支左部队指战员一起举行了多次军民座谈会，相互征求意见，相互介绍、交流斗争经验，相互鼓励促进，最近又一起展开广泛深入的革命大批判运动，进一步增强了革命派内部的团结，更加密切了军民的鱼水关系。
    在武汉的许多工厂和郊区人民公社里，驻军和无产阶级革命派共同抓革命，促生产，一起参加生产劳动，已成为拥军爱民活动的一项重要内容。
    什么是最大的拥军？武汉地区的无产阶级革命派回答得好：坚决相信解放军，学习解放军，依靠解放军，同广大指战员紧紧团结在一起，打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，这就是最大的拥军。什么是最大的爱民？武汉驻军广大指战员回答得好：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，全心全意地保护无产阶级革命派，紧紧地依靠无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立新功，这就是最大的爱民。广大军民这样说，也这样做。现在，武汉地区无产阶级革命派的队伍正在迅速壮大。有着共患难、同甘苦的革命战斗友谊的各革命群众组织之间的团结，正在进一步加强。武汉地区军民团结，共同对敌，围歼中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，阶级敌人已经彻底孤立，完全陷入了人民斗争的汪洋大海。
    据新华社西宁十七日电　青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，相信解放军，依靠解放军，以解放军为榜样，虚心学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的好经验，促进了无产阶级革命派的思想革命化，推动了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。
    青海省驻军各部队，在“三支”、“两军”中派出了几百个毛泽东思想宣传队（组），深入厂矿、农村、牧区、机关、学校等基层单位，大力宣传毛泽东思想。
    他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地支持青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，受到无产阶级革命派热情赞扬。无产阶级革命派把解放军称作是毛主席派来的亲人，人民的好子弟兵。
    青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，在和驻军广大指战员的共同战斗中，更进一步认识到，中国人民解放军毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，思想革命化搞得最好，是我们学习的最好榜样。因此，他们认真地向解放军学习，邀请解放军指战员介绍部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，搞好思想革命化的经验，在阶级斗争风浪中进一步活学活用毛主席著作。
    目前，青海各地掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。不少单位把活学活用毛主席著作，放在先于一切，大于一切，高于一切，重于一切的地位，建立了雷打不散的学习制度。各系统，各部门的革命群众组织，无论召开批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海代理人的大会，还是解决工作中的各种问题，都是先学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导革命和工作的方向。
    在学习毛主席著作过程中，“八·一八”无产阶级革命派特别注意学习解放军带着问题学，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫的好经验。他们从无产阶级文化大革命的斗争需要出发，有目的地去向毛主席著作请教。毛主席怎么说的，他们就怎么做，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，集中火力，集中目标，穷追猛打党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人。
    当前，青海省“拥军爱民”活动出现了一个新的高潮。“八·一八”无产阶级革命派把坚决相信解放军，依靠解放军，学习解放军，作为最大的拥军。驻军指战员也把向革命派传播毛泽东思想，作为最大的爱民。军民肩并肩，心连心，共同以毛泽东思想为指针，集中火力，口诛笔伐，掀起大斗争，大批判新高潮。
