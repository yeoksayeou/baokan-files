The Faithful Lackey of Wall Street Bosses

Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique published a pamphlet titled "Americans Are Thinking, Americans Are Criticizing," openly peddling Khrushchev's so-called "wise" theory of American imperialism. The pamphlet extols Kennedy and his ilk as having "clear minds" and "healthy thoughts," claiming that American "adventurism and aggressive tendencies" do not necessarily always dominate its foreign policy.

The Soviet revisionist clique's fawning praise of American imperialism, the sworn enemy of the people of the world, and its erection of a monument to American imperialism, is undoubtedly a way to curry favor with the Americans; it is also a cover for its collusion with American imperialism to engage in the evil deed of "Sino-American cooperation."

However, American imperialism is still American imperialism, and it will not become an angel of peace just because it has a bunch of shameless traitors singing its praises.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their doom."

American imperialism has always used two hands in its counter-revolutionary tactics: one of violence and war, and the other of political deception and "peace." But regardless of which hand it uses, the goal is to achieve oppression and aggression. American imperialism's "wisdom" is merely the adoption of more cunning, more treacherous, and more vicious methods to carry out its policies of oppression and aggression.

While American imperialism threatens socialist countries with war, it vigorously promotes "peaceful evolution," aiming to undermine socialism and restore capitalism. Can it be said that promoting "peaceful evolution" is a "healthy thought"?

In addition to armed aggression against Asian, African, and Latin American countries, American imperialism also engages in political intrigue and economic infiltration, all aimed at promoting American neo-colonialism. Can it be said that engaging in political intrigue and economic infiltration is a "healthy thought"?

American imperialism uses its two counter-revolutionary hands alternately, but it mainly relies on the hand of violence. When the "peace" hand fails to achieve its goals, it resorts to the hand of war. This is the case in Vietnam, in the Arab region, and in many other regions around the world. In the twenty years since the war, every U.S. president, from Truman and Eisenhower to Kennedy and Johnson, has been a chief culprit of aggression and war. Has there been a single year, month, or day when American imperialism has stopped its external aggression? The Soviet revisionist clique's claim that American "aggressive tendencies" do not always dominate is pure nonsense!

In the past, the traitor Kautsky advised imperialism to expand "in the best way" through "peaceful democratic means." Now, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique advocates the so-called "wise" theory of American imperialism, also advising the Wall Street bosses to use more cunning methods to carry out their aggressive policies. The Soviet revisionist clique is even more treacherous than their predecessor Kautsky. The Soviet revisionist clique not only helps American imperialism with its "peace" hand but also with its war hand. They are double traitors, double lackeys, and double accomplices!

### 华尔街老板的忠实奴才

    华尔街老板的忠实奴才
    最近，苏修集团出版了一本题为《美国人在思考，美国人在批评》的小册子，公然贩卖赫鲁晓夫的所谓美帝国主义“明智论”。小册子大肆宣扬肯尼迪之流“头脑清醒”，具有“健康思想”，并且说什么美国“对外政策中冒险主义的侵略的倾向不一定经常占优势”。
    苏修集团这样肉麻地吹捧全世界人民的死敌美帝国主义，为美帝大立牌坊，固然是要尽其奴才之道，讨美帝的欢心；同时也是为它投靠美帝、勾结美帝打掩护，以便于大干“苏美合作”的罪恶勾当。
    但是，美帝国主义终究是美帝国主义，绝不会因为有苏修这一伙无耻的叛徒为它唱赞歌，就变成和平天使。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
    美帝国主义从来都搞反革命两手，既搞暴力镇压和战争的一手，也搞政治欺骗和“和平”的一手。但不管哪一手，都是为了达到压迫和侵略的目的。美帝国主义的“明智”，无非是采取更狡猾、更阴险、更毒辣的办法，来推行其压迫和侵略政策。
    美帝国主义对社会主义国家实行战争威胁的同时，竭力推行“和平演变”，目的就是要搞垮社会主义，复辟资本主义。难道能够说，搞“和平演变”就是什么“健康思想”吗？
    美帝国主义对亚非拉国家除了武装侵略，也大搞政治阴谋和经济渗透，目的都是为了推行美国新殖民主义。难道能够说搞政治阴谋和经济渗透就是什么“健康思想”吗？
    美帝国主义的反革命两手，是交替使用的，而它主要依靠的还是暴力一手。当“和平”一手不能达到目的时，它就会搞战争一手。在越南是这样，在阿拉伯地区是这样，在世界上许多地区都是这样。战后二十年来，历届美帝头子，从杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔到肯尼迪、约翰逊，有哪一个不是侵略和战争的罪魁祸首呢？美帝国主义有哪一年，哪一月，哪一天，停止过对外侵略？苏修集团所谓美国对外“侵略倾向”不经常“占优势”，这纯粹是胡说八道！
    当年，叛徒考茨基曾经给帝国主义出主意，说什么帝国主义的扩张“最好”“用和平民主的办法来实现”。现在，苏修叛徒集团鼓吹所谓美帝国主义“明智论”，也是给华尔街老板献策，要它用更狡猾的办法去推行侵略政策。而苏修集团比起他们的前辈考茨基，更是青出于蓝而胜于蓝。苏修集团不仅帮美帝的“和平”一手，也帮美帝的战争一手。他们是双料的叛徒，双料的奴才，双料的帮凶！
