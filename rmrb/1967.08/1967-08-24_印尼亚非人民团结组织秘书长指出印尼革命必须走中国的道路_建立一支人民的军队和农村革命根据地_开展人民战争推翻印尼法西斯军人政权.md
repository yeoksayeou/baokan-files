The recent issue of the "Bulletin of the Indonesian Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization" published a radio speech by Ibrahim Isa, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization, in Beijing. He emphasized that only through a people's war led by the Indonesian Communist Party can the Indonesian people achieve liberation.

Isa said that the only path for the Indonesian people in their struggle for liberation is to, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, establish a people's army led by the Indonesian Communist Party, carry out a thorough anti-feudal land revolution, and wage a protracted people's war to overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution and establish a people's democratic government.

He said that apart from completing the establishment of revolutionary bases in the countryside, transforming backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated bases, and turning them into great revolutionary strongholds in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, there is no other way.

Isa quoted from the "Self-Criticism" of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party: "The Indonesian revolution must achieve complete victory by following the path of the Chinese revolution. This means that the Indonesian revolution inevitably must adopt the form of armed struggle of the people against the armed counter-revolution, which is essentially an armed peasant land revolution led by the proletariat."

He particularly stressed the importance of studying Mao Zedong Thought.

He said: Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to the pinnacle of contemporary times. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is a necessity for the revolution and is also a great call issued by the Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party in its "Self-Criticism."

Isa said that the persecution and massacre of Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people by the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime will not force the people to surrender. On the contrary, their persecution of revolutionary people will only accelerate the people's revolution, making it more widespread and vigorous.

Isa said that the Suharto-Nasution fascist beasts and their clique owe a huge blood debt to the Indonesian people and the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, which uses Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, the Indonesian people are determined to settle accounts with the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime and avenge their fallen comrades. Blood debts must be repaid in blood!

Isa said that today, Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people are raising the banner of people's war, igniting sparks in the countryside that will soon become a raging inferno. The Indonesian people, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, are learning war through war.

He said that no force in the world can stop the outbreak of a people's war in Indonesia. Whether it is Johnson, Suharto-Nasution, or Brezhnev, Kosygin, they cannot! The Soviet modern revisionists, who have infiltrated traitors and renegades into the Indonesian revolutionary ranks, attempted to split the Indonesian Communist Party. Not long ago, this group of revisionists issued a black manifesto from Moscow, peddling their bankrupt proposals, advocating for the Indonesian people to take the "peaceful transition" path, and supporting the despicable Suharto-Nasution fascist regime. But this is a futile attempt. They will be crushed by the wheels of the revolution and the people's war, and crushed by Mao Zedong Thought.

Isa said that following the path of people's war indicated by Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, will certainly settle accounts with their number one enemy—the running dogs of American imperialism and the accomplices of Soviet modern revisionism, the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, for their heinous crimes. Only by following this path can the Indonesian people be liberated from the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and establish a people's democratic government throughout Indonesia, achieving final victory.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 22, the recent issue of the "Bulletin of the Indonesian Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization" published an editorial, enthusiastically hailing the editorial titled "Indonesian People Unite to Overthrow the Fascist Regime" published in the 11th issue of the Chinese magazine "Red Flag," and pointing out that this is a great support and encouragement from the great Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people to the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary people, and a serious blow to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime.

The editorial said: "Comrade Mao Zedong, in summing up the experience of the Chinese revolution, said: 'We have many precious experiences. A party that has discipline, is armed with Marxism-Leninism, practices self-criticism, and is linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party.' The editorial emphasized that the Indonesian revolutionary people must firmly grasp these teachings of Chairman Mao and resolutely apply them to our revolution.

The editorial said that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Indonesian revolutionaries will undoubtedly take the "Jinggangshan" path, which is for the proletariat to go to the countryside, lead the peasants in armed struggle and land revolution, establish revolutionary bases in the countryside, and use the countryside to surround the cities, ultimately seizing national power.

The editorial pointed out that the Indonesian people will never forget the great encouragement from the Chinese people. The peoples of China and Indonesia have the same deep affection for the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the two peoples will forever stand together, shoulder to shoulder, and fight to defeat imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and reactionaries from various countries.

The editorial concluded that the Indonesian people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and achieve final victory!

    印尼亚非人民团结组织秘书长指出印尼革命必须走中国的道路
    建立一支人民的军队和农村革命根据地
    开展人民战争推翻印尼法西斯军人政权
    新华社二十三日讯  最近出版的《印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织公报》刊登了印尼亚非人民团结组织秘书长易卜拉欣·伊萨在北京的一篇广播讲话。他强调指出，只有经过印度尼西亚共产党领导的人民战争，印尼人民才能获得解放。
    伊萨说，印度尼西亚人民在解放斗争中应该走的唯一道路，是在毛泽东思想的灯塔照耀下，建立一支由印尼共领导的人民军队，进行深入的反封建土地革命，展开长期的人民战争，以便打倒苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，建立人民民主政权。
    他说，除了完成在农村建立革命根据地，把落后的农村变成先进的、巩固的根据地，变成军事上、政治上、经济上和文化上的伟大的革命阵地外，别无它路。
    伊萨援引印尼共产党中央委员会政治局的《自我批评》中的话说：“印度尼西亚革命要取得完全的胜利，必须走中国革命的道路。这就是说，印度尼西亚革命不可避免地必须采取武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命这一主要的斗争形式，其实质是无产阶级领导下的武装的农民土地革命。”
    他特别强调学习毛泽东思想的重要意义。
    他说：毛泽东同志光辉地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到当代的顶峰。学习毛泽东思想是革命的需要，也是印度尼西亚共产党政治局在《自我批评》中所发出的伟大号召。
    伊萨说，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权对印度尼西亚共产党人和革命人民的迫害和屠杀决不能迫使人民投降。相反，他们对革命人民的迫害，只会加速人民的革命，使革命更广泛更蓬勃地发展。
    伊萨说，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯野兽及其一伙对印度尼西亚人民和中国人民欠下了一大笔血债。印度尼西亚人民，在用毛泽东思想作为武器的印度尼西亚共产党领导下，决心同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权算账，替他们被杀害的战友报仇。血债必须用血来还！
    伊萨说，今天，印尼共产党人和革命人民正在高举人民战争的旗帜，在农村点燃起将要燎原的星星之火。印尼人民遵照毛主席的教导，正在通过战争学习战争。
    他说，世界上没有任何力量能阻止在印尼爆发人民战争。无论是约翰逊、苏哈托—纳苏蒂安，或是勃列日涅夫、柯西金等都不能！苏联现代修正主义者纠集混进印尼革命队伍中的卖国贼和叛徒，妄图分裂印度尼西亚共产党。不久以前，这帮修正主义分子从莫斯科散发了一个黑纲领，大肆兜售他们破了产的主张，鼓吹印尼人民走“和平过渡”的道路，并支持可恶的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权。但这是妄想，他们必将被革命的车轮和人民战争辗得粉碎，被毛泽东思想辗得粉碎。
    伊萨说，遵照毛泽东思想所指明的人民战争的道路，印尼人民在印尼共产党的领导下定能清算他们的头号敌人——美帝国主义的看门狗、苏联现代修正主义的帮凶苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的滔天罪行。只有走这条道路，印尼人民才能从苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权下解放出来并在全印尼建立人民民主政权，取得最后胜利。
    据新华社二十二日讯  最近出版的《印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织公报》发表社论，热烈欢呼中国《红旗》杂志第十一期发表的题为《印度尼西亚人民团结起来，为推翻法西斯政权而斗争》的社论，并且指出，这是伟大的毛主席、中国共产党和中国人民对印尼共产党和印尼革命人民的巨大支持和鼓励，是对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的严重打击。
    社论说：“毛泽东同志在总结中国革命经验时说：‘我们有许多宝贵的经验。一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。’”社论强调说，印尼革命人民必须牢牢掌握毛主席的这些教导，并坚决地把它们运用于我们的革命。
    社论说，在毛泽东思想指导之下的印尼革命者无疑将走“井冈山”道路，这就是无产阶级到农村去，领导农民进行武装斗争和土地革命，在农村建立革命根据地，以便用农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。
    社论指出，印尼人民决不会忘记中国人民对他们的巨大鼓励。中国和印尼两国人民对他们心中最红的红太阳毛主席有着同样深厚的热爱之情。在毛泽东思想的指导下，两国人民将永远在一起，并肩战斗，打败以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    社论最后说，印尼人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定会推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，赢得最后胜利！
