The Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Cambodia, Zheng Sixiong, on behalf of the Chinese government, called on Cambodian Foreign Minister Norodom Phirun on August 31. He reaffirmed that the Chinese government fully respects and acknowledges the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders. He also strongly opposed all plots by U.S. imperialism to invade Cambodia. Zheng Sixiong pointed out that the Government of the People's Republic of China has taken note of the statement issued by the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia on July 22, 1967. The U.S. imperialists, along with their puppets in Thailand and South Vietnam, have consistently violated the borders of the Kingdom of Cambodia, threatening Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. After the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued joint communiqués on November 2, 1966, and May 9, 1967, regarding the respect for Cambodia's current borders and territorial integrity, U.S. imperialists have resorted to tricks and deliberately distorted the meaning of the communiqués. Their intention is clear: to create opportunities for continued aggression against Cambodia.

Zheng Sixiong emphasized that the Chinese government has always respected Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The Chinese government supports the stance of the statement issued by the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia on July 22, 1967, and reaffirms that the Chinese government fully respects and acknowledges the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders. The Chinese government strongly opposes all plots by U.S. imperialism to invade Cambodia.

The Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued a statement on July 22, saying: "In recent weeks, the common attitude of governments closely related to the United States has been to give a limited interpretation to the phrase 'respect for our current borders.' This could mean that some countries that have issued statements of 'respect' for our current borders, while guaranteeing not to invade our borders, do not necessarily recognize the definitive nature of these borders. This fundamental limitation could mean that the borders opposed by the regimes in Bangkok, Saigon, and Vientiane may not be guaranteed, and these regimes may be instigated to make further (territorial) demands." The statement said: "Considering the attitudes of certain countries, the Royal Government regrets to point out that its previous request for respect for Cambodia's current borders has not provided the assurances it hoped to obtain now and in the future. Therefore, it must request the governments of friendly countries that have announced their respect for Cambodia's current borders to understand and to clarify, in a form they deem appropriate, that their previous statements include the recognition of these borders."

    我驻柬埔寨大使馆临时代办重申
    中国政府完全尊重和承认柬目前边界内的领土完整
    柬埔寨政府就柬目前边界问题发表声明
    新华社金边三十一日电　中国驻柬埔寨大使馆临时代办郑斯雄，奉中国政府指示，三十一日拜会柬埔寨外交大臣诺罗敦·普里萨拉，重申中国政府完全尊重和承认柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略柬埔寨的一切阴谋活动。郑斯雄指出：中华人民共和国政府注意到柬埔寨王国政府一九六七年七月二十二日发表的声明。美帝国主义及其仆从泰国和南越傀儡一贯侵犯柬埔寨王国的边境，威胁柬埔寨的独立、主权和领土完整。在柬埔寨王国政府一九六六年十一月二日和一九六七年五月九日就尊重柬埔寨目前边界内领土完整的公报发表以后，美帝国主义玩弄花招，别有用心地歪曲公报的含义，企图为继续侵略柬埔寨大开方便之门，其阴谋是很明显的。
    郑斯雄强调说：中国政府一贯尊重柬埔寨的独立、主权和领土完整。中国政府支持柬埔寨王国政府一九六七年七月二十二日声明的立场，并且重申，中国政府完全尊重和承认柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略柬埔寨的一切阴谋活动。
    新华社金边三十一日电　柬埔寨王国政府二十二日发表声明说：近几周，“同美国有着密切关系的各国政府的共同态度，就是要对‘尊重’我国目前边界的这句话给以有限的含义。这一来，可能发表‘尊重’我国现有边界声明的某些国家，虽然保证不侵犯我国边界，但是并不表明这种边界的性质已定。这种带有根本意义的局限性可能意味着遭到曼谷、西贡和万象政权反对的边界线得不到保证，这些政权可能被唆使提出进一步的（领土）要求。”声明说：“考虑到某些国家采取的态度，王国政府十分遗憾地指出，它以前提出尊重柬埔寨目前边界的要求，没有使它得到目前和将来希望得到的保证。因此，它不得不请求已经宣布尊重柬埔寨目前边界的友好国家政府谅解，并要求它们以它们认为妥善的形式说明，它们以前发表的声明包含着承认这些边界。”
