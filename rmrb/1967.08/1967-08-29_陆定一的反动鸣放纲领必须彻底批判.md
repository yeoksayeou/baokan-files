In May 1956, on the eve of the tumultuous anti-rightist movement, the "Great King of Hell," the academic despot Lu Dingyi, delivered a report titled "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." This was a thoroughly reactionary bourgeois program. This black program, standing on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, adapted to the political needs of the bourgeoisie, appropriated the great leader Chairman Mao's proposal of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," this proletarian revolutionary slogan, using the method of "stealing heaven and changing the mandate," castrated its revolutionary soul, and stuffed in his own goods, paving the way for the conspiracy to restore capitalism.

To carry the revolution through to the end or to make history regress?

In 1956, our country was at a major historical turning point. That year, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce was basically completed. At this time, the question before our country was: after achieving decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front, should we further carry out the socialist revolution in the ideological realm? What policy should we adopt to carry out this revolution? This is a major issue concerning whether our country's socialist system and proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated, a major issue concerning our country's future and the fate of the world.

At this critical moment, our great helmsman Chairman Mao first scientifically, systematically, and profoundly analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and sagely pointed out that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Therefore, it is not enough to carry out the socialist revolution only on the economic front; we must also deeply carry out the socialist revolution in the ideological realm and carry the revolution through to the end! Based on this situation, Chairman Mao, with his far-sighted vision and great ambition, brilliantly formulated the great strategic policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a policy to carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in the ideological realm, a policy to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, develop socialist economy, and flourish socialist culture, a policy to thoroughly eliminate the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

However, at this critical moment, China's Khrushchev openly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao, loudly advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." He blathered on about how "after the public-private partnership, the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has also been resolved," "domestic enemies have been basically eliminated," and "class struggle has basically ended."

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, in tune with China's Khrushchev, also raised the black flag of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," manufacturing various so-called "bases" to distort the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend": First, "our country is about to become a socialist country without an exploiting class"; second, "the political and ideological situation in the intellectual community has undergone fundamental changes"; third, "the enemy, especially the domestic enemy, has been greatly weakened"; fourth, "the political and ideological unity of the people nationwide has been greatly strengthened." In short, contradictions have disappeared, classes have vanished, class struggle has ended, and all that remains is to "strive for the prosperity of our country's literature and art" and "to make our country's scientific work catch up with the world's advanced level." According to Lu Dingyi's reactionary logic, it seems that the world is peaceful and nothing is amiss, and there is no need for revolution; all that is needed is construction.

Is this really the case? Absolutely not!

Soon after Lu Dingyi's black program was released, didn't the bourgeois rightists, under the banner of "freedom of speech," launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, clamoring for the "Communist Party to step down"?

The glorious victories of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement, didn't they arouse the extreme hatred of domestic and foreign class enemies? Didn't the great schemer Peng Dehuai stir up trouble at the Lushan Conference, plotting to usurp military power and rebel against the Party?

Just when our people were self-reliant and striving to overcome the temporary economic difficulties, didn't the ghosts and demons seize the opportunity to emerge, collude with external forces, and internally and externally conspire to sharpen their knives and launch an unprecedented great counterattack, attempting to change the regime?

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, isn't a small handful of power-holders within the Party, with tenfold frenzy and a hundredfold hatred, struggling desperately?

This series of heart-pounding class struggles has completely shattered the shameless lies of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle"!

Class struggle includes political, economic, and ideological aspects. After the proletariat has overthrown the old rulers in politics and economics and gained the ruling position, it does not mean the end of class struggle. In the ideological realm, the old forces are still very strong; they will not voluntarily retreat from the historical stage but will struggle desperately to restore and maintain the old regime of private ownership. This struggle in the ideological realm is more intense, more complex, and longer-lasting than the struggle to seize political power and change the ownership system, taking decades, even hundreds of years, to complete.

To deny class struggle, to lull the revolutionary spirit of the laboring people, and to facilitate the more effective implementation of the dictatorship of the exploiting classes over the laboring people, this is a trick used by all exploiting classes in history and all old and new revisionists. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi deliberately covers up the existence of class and class struggle, which in itself is a means of their class struggle. Their "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is actually a "theory of extinguishing class struggle," that is, to extinguish the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and to intensify the struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the ideological realm.

To eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, or to promote bourgeois liberalization?

The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is critical and revolutionary. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have developed through continuous struggle against various erroneous and reactionary ideologies.

The essence of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the critical and revolutionary spirit of eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology. When expounding this policy, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "We will still have to engage in long-term struggle against the ideology of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Those who do not understand this situation and abandon ideological struggle are wrong. All erroneous ideologies, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." How to carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in the ideological realm? Only by implementing the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," "allowing everyone to express their opinions, making people dare to speak, dare to criticize, and dare to debate; not fearing erroneous opinions, not fearing poisonous things; developing mutual debate and criticism among various opinions; allowing freedom of criticism and also allowing criticism of critics; for erroneous opinions, not suppressing them but persuading them with reason." Only in this way can there be a more discerning comparison, through the struggle of opposites, overcome erroneous opinions, develop correct opinions, uproot poisonous weeds, cultivate fragrant flowers, and thus promote the development of art and science, flourish socialist culture, and consolidate proletarian dictatorship.

However, this academic despot Lu Dingyi went the opposite way. He stripped the revolutionary soul of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," erased its class content, and distorted it into a policy of bourgeois liberalization. He vigorously advocated for full freedom in literature and art and scientific research work, freedom without any constraints, even shouting that "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is "opposing rigid rules" and a "great liberation."

Lu Dingyi's advocacy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a replica of China's Khrushchev's "allow coexistence" and "coexistence and inclusion," a variant of the "thaw" advocated by Soviet modern revisionists, and is fundamentally opposed to Chairman Mao's revolutionary policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology. The old revisionist Bernstein has a notorious formula: "Movement is everything, the goal is nothing." Lu Dingyi is truly a disciple of Bernstein; whenever he talks about "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," it is freedom! freedom! freedom! He also has a formula: "Freedom is everything, the goal is nothing."

Is there really no goal?

A large amount of evidence shows: Over the past seventeen years, Lu Dingyi has used the power he usurped to promote bourgeois liberalization in the ideological and cultural circles. On the one hand, he shouted loudly to break the "rigid rules" and to "open up," creating a wide-open gate for the ghosts and monsters to emerge; on the other hand, when the proletariat rises to criticize the bourgeoisie, he hysterically shouts about "leftist extremism," "simplistic and brutal," "labeling," "vulgarization," and "one voice dominates"! He puts a big hat of "dogmatism," "sectarianism," and the like on the heads of the proletarian revolutionaries. In short, it is only allowed for the bourgeoisie to spread poison, but not for the proletariat to counterattack. Look:

In the academic circle, he vigorously advocated for the existence of "bourgeois schools of thought," for the freedom to propagate idealism, shouting "long live bourgeois ideology," and viciously attacking leftist academic workers for "monopolizing," "stagnating," and "degenerating." When Comrade Yao Wenyuan and others responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and bravely criticized the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed His Official Post" by Wu Han, he again colluded with the big Party despot Peng Zhen, who relied on "arbitrariness and coercion," in the infamous "Report Outline," using the banner of academic criticism to shelter the rightists and suppress the leftists.

In the educational circle, under the guise of "transmitting knowledge and learning knowledge," he opened up a large number of courses on ancient and modern Western bourgeois idealism and reactionary theories, shamelessly promoting the decadent bourgeois revisionist ideology, and fiercely denouncing the mass movement of educational reform as "chaos, mess, and bias."

In the news circle, he actively advocated for the opening of a "free market," establishing "colleague newspapers" and "colleague publications." He viciously slandered our Party newspapers as having an "iron face," "adopting a blockade policy," and "one day being overthrown by others."

In the literary and artistic circle, he vigorously advocated the "theory of universal art," claiming that today's art should serve everyone, "even including prisoners." He vigorously advocated the "anti-theory of thematic determination," advocating the writing of "celestial immortals" and "talking animals," and so on. He vigorously advocated the "theory of writing reality," inciting ghosts and monsters to expose the "dark side" of socialism and write "tragedies" of the new society. He cursed our direction of writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, writing about the new society, and writing about new characters as "rigid rules," "formalism," and "low taste," which "will only stifle literary work." He slandered our literary criticism as "making it like a temple of Confucius, with no place for others."

In the publishing circle, he repeatedly advocated for the establishment of "self-funded publishing houses," publishing "strange and strange books," and even "rightist anti-Marxist books can be published." On the contrary, he was extremely hostile to the brilliant works of our great leader Chairman Mao, using every means to obstruct and sabotage their publication.

Enough! Enough! Just these facts are enough to see through what kind of freedom Lu Dingyi is shouting about under the banner of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and for what purpose. The freedom he is shouting about is only for the bourgeoisie to have the freedom to be anti-Party, but not for the proletariat to have the freedom to counterattack, which is bourgeois dictatorship. He is peddling this freedom so maliciously, aiming to create a counter-revolutionary public opinion for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

Is it the Party's mass line, or the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" monopolizing?

Marxists have always believed that the cause of the proletariat can only rely on the people.

The mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" is the fundamental line in all the Party's work. When expounding the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," Chairman Mao pointed out that to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, one can only look from the perspective of the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, "to learn with the masses to carefully distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and to fight against poisonous weeds with correct methods together with the masses." Obviously, the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and mobilize the masses to struggle against bourgeois ideology. It is the concrete manifestation of the Party's mass line in literature and art and scientific research.

However, Lu Dingyi blatantly distorted the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" into the line of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." He put on an air of a nobleman and a "big figure," shouting about "by its name, those who can be called 'masters' should contend." He ruthlessly excluded the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and "small figures" from the gate of science and culture.

For those so-called "masters" who can be called "experts" and "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, Lu Dingyi, like China's Khrushchev, treated the Soviet revisionist "experts" as "gods," kowtowing and worshipping them, praising them as "Zhuge Liang," deciding whether our country can become an "advanced country," listening to their "criticisms," seeking their "advice," and only being able to "work hard" to learn their "conclusions." For them, he only spoke of "unity" and "cooperation," and did not allow any touch on their bourgeois ugly souls. If anyone touched them, it was "injuring" them, making them "unhappy," which was "sectarianism." In short, Lu Dingyi opposed the workers, peasants, and soldiers from taking the stage of science and culture, suppressed the new fighting forces representing the proletariat—the "small figures," and maintained the bourgeoisie's and "big figures'" monopoly over science and culture.

Those who can be called "masters" have the right to speak, this is sheer nonsense. The laboring people are the creators of history and the driving force of social development. Throughout history, it has always been the new forces that defeat the decaying forces. Chairman Mao, more than twenty years ago, issued a great battle call to us: The workers, peasants, and soldiers should not only occupy the political stage and the stage of economic life but also occupy the stage of literature and art. He also taught us not to be intimidated by authorities, celebrities, or scholars, not to be intimidated by great scholars, to dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to innovate. To implement "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," is to mobilize hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to organize a vast army of cultural revolution, to launch a great offensive against all the decaying ideologies of the exploiting classes; it is to enable the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary intellectuals, through mass struggles, to experience storms and see the world, gradually master the great Mao Zedong Thought, and create a new culture that humanity has never had, the most brilliant and splendid.

Those who can be called "masters" have the right to speak, in fact, is only to allow the bourgeoisie's "experts" and "authorities" to monopolize, and not to allow the broad revolutionary masses to speak. In fact, since ancient times, science and culture have always been monopolized by the exploiting classes. After liberation, science and culture, to a large extent, are still in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. The monopoly of science and culture by the bourgeoisie must be changed, and it must not be allowed to continue. Chairman Mao said: "We are prepared to use this policy of letting things loose to unite several million intellectuals and change their current appearance." This means that implementing "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," through free discussion and criticism and struggle, win over and unite the majority of intellectuals, gradually change their bourgeois worldview, establish a proletarian worldview, and thus better play their socialist initiative. It is very clear that implementing "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is to unite, educate, and transform intellectuals, making them serve the proletariat, rather than allowing the bourgeoisie to monopolize the ideological and cultural front. Lu Dingyi, for the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," only spoke of so-called "unity," "cooperation," and "united front," and did not speak of criticism, struggle, and ideological transformation. He even shouted that "two should be passed down, Marxism-Leninism should be passed down, and bourgeois ideology should also be passed down; long live Marxism-Leninism, and long live bourgeois ideology." This is truly a great absurdity. Marxism-Leninism and bourgeois ideology are incompatible. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle. It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, and there is no talk of "two should be passed down" and "two long lives." Lu Dingyi's shouting of "two should be passed down" and "two long lives" actually, the first "passing down" is false, and the second "passing down" is true. He wants to knock down Marxism-Leninism and let bourgeois ideology "pass down." If Lu Dingyi's reactionary doctrine is followed, it will only allow them to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our Party and our country, ultimately leading to a great historical regression.

To greatly promote the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, or to promote revisionist "great liberation"?

"Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" ultimately comes down to greatly eliminating bourgeois ideology and greatly promoting the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not to admit this is the most fundamental difference between us and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi.

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, our vice-commander Lin Biao, pointed out: "Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship socialist country with seven hundred million people, and it needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought fully embodies the highest interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. We must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, drive everything, and transform everything. The great strategic policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is an extremely important component of Mao Zedong Thought. Implementing the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" can only be guided by Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish whether people's words and deeds are correct, whether they are fragrant flowers or poisonous weeds, and to make the contending and blossoming proceed on the correct track, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions!

However, this historical clown Lu Dingyi, like a bat fearing sunlight, fears the great Mao Zedong Thought. He has always been crazy about defaming and attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, using every means to obstruct and sabotage the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought. On the issue of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," he again fiercely waved the big stick of "opposing dogmatism," attempting to resist the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and lead the contending and blossoming onto the revisionist path. He viciously attacked the struggle, after the founding of the country, to criticize the reactionary film "Wu Xun" with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, the struggle to criticize "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber," and the struggle to criticize the reactionary thoughts of Hu Shi, the struggle to criticize the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng group, as "dogmatism," as the "spirit of Ah Q," having a "dark side," causing "brain stiffening," "dead silence," "stagnation," and "retreat." He even viciously slandered Mao Zedong Thought as a "new label," as being "in the palm of the Buddha." He gnashed his teeth and shouted, "We must resolutely struggle against dogmatism."

This thoroughly reactionary fellow Lu Dingyi, the "dogmatism" he attacks is none other than the most fundamental things of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The "great liberation" he shouts about, to escape from the "palm of the Buddha," is to deviate from the track of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is the great liberation of revisionism.

Lu Dingyi's shouting is not an isolated phenomenon. At that time, the traitorous clique of Khrushchev and the biggest handful of power-holders in China who took the capitalist road, under the banner of opposing "personal cult" and "dogmatism," launched a revisionist tide to attack Marxism-Leninism and proletarian dictatorship. Just at the critical moment when the international communist movement was shrouded in heavy fog, our great helmsman Chairman Mao, with his most steadfast proletarian stance and far-sighted political vision, dispelled the fog and pointed the way, issuing a great call: "Under the current situation, revisionism is more harmful than dogmatism. One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to launch a criticism of revisionism."

Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, using the sharp weapon of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," to thoroughly criticize all bourgeois ideologies and revisionist thoughts, to vigorously promote all fragrant flowers that support, love, and sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, to uproot all poisonous weeds that distort, oppose, and attack Mao Zedong Thought, and to greatly promote the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the ideological realm.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, over the past decade, distorted the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," vigorously promoted bourgeois liberalization, and actively created counter-revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Debts must be repaid. We must rise up with the thousand-jin rod of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly, completely, and entirely sweep away the evil winds and fog that Lu Dingyi and his ilk have spread over the past decade, letting Chairman Mao's great thought of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" shine forever in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world!

    陆定一的反动鸣放纲领必须彻底批判
    旧文化部　延安红旗总团
    一九五六年五月，也就是轰轰烈烈的反右派运动的前夕，大“阎王”、大学阀陆定一作了名为“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的黑报告。这是一个彻头彻尾的资产阶级反动纲领。这个黑纲领，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，适应资产阶级的政治需要，把我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣这一无产阶级的革命口号接过去，用偷天换日的手法，阉割其革命灵魂，塞进他的私货，为阴谋复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    是将革命进行到底，还是使历史倒退
    一九五六年，我国正处在一个重大的历史转变关头。这一年，我国农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造基本完成。这时，摆在我国面前的问题是，在经济战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利之后，要不要进一步在意识形态领域里进行社会主义革命？应该采取什么方针进行这一革命？这是关系到我国社会主义制度和无产阶级专政能不能巩固的大问题，是关系到我国的前途和世界命运的大问题。
    就在这个关键时刻，我们伟大的舵手毛主席第一次科学地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，英明地指出，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”因此，仅仅搞经济战线上的社会主义革命是不够的，还必须在意识形态领域里深入进行社会主义革命，将革命进行到底！正是根据这一情况，毛主席以他的远见卓识和伟大气魄，天才地制定了百花齐放、百家争鸣这一伟大的战略方针。
    毛主席提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是在意识形态领域里开展灭资兴无斗争的方针，是巩固无产阶级专政、发展社会主义经济、繁荣社会主义文化的方针，是彻底消灭资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的思想的方针。
    但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫，也在这个关键时刻，公然和我们伟大的领袖毛主席相对抗，大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”。他胡说什么“公私合营以后，无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”，“国内敌人已经基本上被消灭”，“阶级斗争已经基本上结束”。
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一和中国的赫鲁晓夫一个腔调，也打出了“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑旗，为他篡改党的百花齐放、百家争鸣方针制造种种所谓“根据”：一曰“我国即将成为没有剥削阶级的社会主义国家”；二曰“知识界的政治思想状况已经有了根本的变化”；三曰“敌人特别国内敌人已经大大削弱了”；四曰“全国人民政治上思想上的一致性大大增强”。总之一句话，矛盾消失了，阶级不见了，阶级斗争结束了，剩下的只有“为繁荣我国的文学艺术而努力，为使我国的科学工作赶上世界先进水平”了。按照陆定一的反动逻辑，似乎天下太平无事了，不需要搞革命，只要搞建设好了。
    事实果真是这样吗？绝对不是！
    就在陆定一这个黑纲领出笼之后不久，资产阶级右派不是打着“鸣放”的招牌，向党向社会主义发动猖狂的进攻，叫嚣要“共产党下台”吗？
    党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的辉煌胜利，不是又激起了国内外阶级敌人的极端仇恨，大野心家彭德怀不是在庐山会议上兴妖作怪，阴谋篡军反党吗？
    正当我国人民自力更生，奋发图强，冲破惊涛骇浪，为战胜三年暂时经济困难而英勇奋斗的时候，牛鬼蛇神不是乘机纷纷出笼，内外勾结，上下串通，磨刀霍霍，掀起了一场前所未有的大反扑，妄图变天吗？
  在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不是以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨，进行拚死的挣扎吗？
    这一系列惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗，彻底粉碎了“阶级斗争熄灭论”的无耻谰言！
    阶级斗争，包括政治、经济和意识形态三个方面。无产阶级在政治上、经济上推翻了旧的统治，取得统治地位之后，并不等于阶级斗争的结束。在意识形态领域内，旧势力还很强大，它不会自动地退出历史舞台，它还要拚命地为恢复维护私有制的旧政权而挣扎。这一方面的斗争，比之夺取政权，改变所有制的斗争，更激烈、更复杂，时间更长，要经过几十年，甚至几百年才能完成。
    否认阶级斗争，麻痹劳动人民的革命斗志，以利于剥削阶级更有效地推行他们对劳动人民的专政，这是历史上所有的剥削阶级和一切新老修正主义者所惯用的伎俩。反革命修正主义分子陆定一故意掩盖阶级和阶级斗争的存在，这本身就是他们进行阶级斗争的一种手段。他们的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，其实是“熄灭阶级斗争论”，也就是要熄灭无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，加紧资产阶级向无产阶级的斗争，在意识形态领域里实行资产阶级专政。
    是灭资兴无，还是资产阶级自由化
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是批判的革命的。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想就是在同各种错误的反动的思想不断的斗争中发展起来的。
      百花齐放、百家争鸣方针的灵魂就是灭资兴无的批判的革命精神。毛主席在论述这一方针时，就明确指出：“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”怎样展开意识形态领域里灭资兴无的斗争呢？只有实行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，“放手让大家讲意见，使人们敢于说话，敢于批评，敢于争论；不怕错误的议论，不怕有毒素的东西；发展各种意见之间的相互争论和相互批评，既容许批评的自由，也容许批评批评者的自由；对于错误的意见，不是压服，而是说服，以理服人”。这样才有比较有鉴别，通过对立面的斗争，克服错误的意见，发展正确的意见，铲除毒草，培植香花，从而促进艺术的发展和科学的进步，繁荣社会主义文化，巩固无产阶级专政。
    陆定一这个大学阀，却反其道而行之。他抽掉百花齐放、百家争鸣方针的革命灵魂，抹杀其阶级内容，把它篡改为资产阶级自由化的政策。他拚命鼓吹在文学艺术和科学研究工作中要有充分的自由，不受任何约束的自由，甚至叫喊什么百花齐放、百家争鸣是“反对清规戒律”，是“大解放”。
    陆定一所鼓吹的百花齐放、百家争鸣，是中国赫鲁晓夫的“允许并存”、“兼容并包”的翻版，是苏联现代修正主义者所叫嚣的“解冻”的变种，是同毛主席所提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣这一灭资兴无的革命方针根本对立的。老牌修正主义者伯恩斯坦，有一个臭名昭著的公式：“运动就是一切，目的是没有的。”陆定一不愧为伯恩斯坦的门徒，他一讲到百花齐放、百家争鸣，就是自由！自由！自由！他也有一个公式：
  “自由就是一切，目的是没有的”。
    难道真的是没有目的吗？
    大量事实证明：十七年来，陆定一利用他窃取的权力，在思想文化界，大搞资产阶级自由化。他一方面大喊大叫要打破“格格”，要“敞开来”，为牛鬼蛇神出笼大开闸门；另一方面，当无产阶级起来批判资产阶级时，他就歇斯底里地叫喊什么“左得厉害”啊！
  “简单粗暴”啊！“贴标签”啊！“庸俗化”啊！“一家独鸣”啊！把“教条主义”、“宗派主义”等一大堆帽子，扣在无产阶级革命派的头上。一言以蔽之，就是只准资产阶级放毒，不准无产阶级反击。请看：
    在学术界，他极力鼓吹要“有资产阶级的学派”，要“有宣传唯心主义的自由”，大喊“资产阶级思想也万岁”，恶毒地攻击左派学术工作者“垄断”、“僵化”、“堕落”。当姚文元等同志响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，奋起批判吴晗的《海瑞罢官》等大毒草的时候，他又同专靠“武断和以势压人”的大党阀彭真串通一气，在臭名昭著的《汇报提纲》里，打起学术批判的招牌，包庇右派，镇压左派。
    在教育界，他打着“传授知识，学习知识”的幌子，大量开设古今中外资产阶级唯心主义和反动学说课程，肆无忌惮地推销资产阶级修正主义的腐朽思想，大骂教育改革的群众运动是“乱、糟、偏”。
    在新闻界，他积极提倡开放“自由市场”，办“同仁报纸”、“同仁刊物”。恶毒诬蔑我们的党报是“铁面孔”，“采取封锁政策”，“有一天要给人家打倒”。
    在文艺界，他极力鼓吹“全民文艺论”，胡说今天的文艺要为一切人服务，“甚而至于包括牢里的囚犯”。他极力鼓吹“反题材决定论”，主张写“天上的仙人”、“会说话的禽兽”等等。他极力鼓吹“写真实论”，煽动牛鬼蛇神暴露社会主义的“阴暗面”，写新社会的“悲剧”。他咒骂我们写工农兵、写新社会、写新人物的方向是“清规戒律”、“公式主义”和“低级趣味”，“只会把文艺工作窒息”。他诬蔑我们的文艺批评“搞得象孔庙，旁人没有份”。
    在出版界，他一再主张开办“自费出版社”，“出奇奇怪怪的书”，“右派分子反马克思主义的书也可以出”。相反，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作，他却极端仇视，千方百计地阻挠和破坏它的出版。
    够了！够了！仅仅这些事实，就完全可以看穿陆定一在百花齐放、百家争鸣的旗号下，叫喊的这种自由，那种自由，究竟是什么货色，究竟是为了什么。他所叫喊的自由，是只准资产阶级有反党的自由，不准无产阶级有反击的自由，就是资产阶级专政。他这样大肆兜售自由，其罪恶的目的，就是为了给中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。
     是党的群众路线，还是资产阶级“专家”“权威”垄断
    马克思主义者从来就认为无产阶级的事业，只能依靠人民群众。
      “从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，是党在一切工作中的根本路线。毛主席在阐明百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针时指出，要辨别什么是香花，什么是毒草，只能从广大人民群众的观点来看，同时，“要同群众一起来学会谨慎地辨别香花和毒草，并且一起来用正确的方法同毒草作斗争。”显然，党的百花齐放，百家争鸣方针，就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，发动群众同资产阶级思想作斗争的方针。它是党的群众路线在文学艺术和科学研究中的具体体现。
    陆定一却公然把党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针篡改为资产阶级“专家”“权威”的路线，他摆出一副贵族老爷、“大人物”的架势，叫嚷什么“顾名思义，争鸣的应当是多少可以称为‘家’的。”穷凶极恶地把广大工农兵和“小人物”排斥在科学文化大门之外。
    对于那些所谓“多少可以称为‘家’的”资产阶级
  “专家”、“权威”，陆定一象中国的赫鲁晓夫把苏修
  “专家”奉为“佛”一样的虔诚，卑躬屈膝，顶礼膜拜，吹捧他们是“诸葛亮”，将“决定”我国能否成为“一个先进的国家”，要多听他们的“批评”，多向他们“请教”，只能“下功夫”学他们“已有的结论”，对他们只能讲“团结”、“合作”，而根本不许丝毫触动他们的资产阶级丑恶灵魂。如果谁触动了，就是“伤害”他们，使他们“心情不愉快”，就是“宗派主义”。总之，陆定一反对工农兵登上科学文化舞台，压制代表无产阶级的战斗的新生力量——“小人物”，维护资产阶级、“大人物”对科学文化的垄断。
      “多少可以称为‘家’的”，才有发言权，这完全是一派胡言。劳动人民是历史的创造者，是社会发展的动力。世界上从来就是新生力量战胜腐朽力量。毛主席早在二十多年以前，就向我们发出伟大的战斗号召：工农兵不仅要占领政治舞台、经济生活的舞台，而且要占领文学艺术舞台。他还教导我们，不要被权威、名人吓倒，不要被大学问家吓倒，要敢想、敢说、敢做、敢于创新。实行百花齐放、百家争鸣，就是要在毛泽东思想旗帜下，发动亿万革命群众，组织起浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，向一切剥削阶级腐朽思想大进攻；就是要广大工农兵和革命知识分子在群众斗争中，经风雨，见世面，逐步掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，创造人类从未有过的、最光辉灿烂的新文化。
      “多少可以称为‘家’的”，才有发言权，实际上是只准资产阶级“专家”“权威”垄断，不许广大革命群众发言。事实上，自有史以来，科学文化就一直垄断在剥削阶级手里。解放以后，科学文化，在很大程度上，仍然掌握在资产阶级知识分子的手里。资产阶级垄断科学文化的局面必须改变，决不能再让它继续下去。毛主席说：“我们准备用这个放的方针来团结几百万知识分子，改变他们现在的面貌。”这就是说，实行百花齐放、百家争鸣，通过自由讨论和批评、斗争，争取和团结大多数知识分子，逐步改变他们的资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，从而更好地发挥他们的社会主义积极性。很明白，实行百花齐放、百家争鸣，是要团结、教育和改造知识分子，使之为无产阶级服务，而不是听任资产阶级垄断思想文化阵地。陆定一对资产阶级“专家”“权威”只讲所谓“团结”
  “合作”“统一战线”，不讲批评、斗争、思想改造，甚至狂叫要“两个传下去，马列主义传下去，资产阶级思想也传下去；马列主义万岁，资产阶级思想也万岁。”这真是天大的奇谈怪论。马列主义同资产阶级思想，是水火不相容的。它们之间的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，根本谈不上什么“两个传下去”、“两个万岁”。陆定一所叫嚷的“两个传下去”“两个万岁”，实际上，头一个“传下去”是假，后一个“传下去”是真，他是要把马列主义打下去，让资产阶级思想“传下去”。如果按照陆定一这一套反动宗旨办理，那只有听任他们用资产阶级世界观来改造我们的党，来改造我们的国家，最后导致历史的大倒退。
    是大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，还是修正主义“大解放”
    百花齐放、百家争鸣，归根结蒂，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。承认不承认这一点，是我们和反革命修正主义分子陆定一最最根本的分歧。
    毛主席的亲密战友，我们的副统帅林彪同志指出：
  “我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”毛泽东思想集中体现了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的最高利益。我们就是要用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切，改造一切。百花齐放、百家争鸣这一伟大战略方针，是毛泽东思想极为重要的组成部分。实行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，只有以毛泽东思想为指导，才能鉴别人们的言论行动是否正确，究竟是香花还是毒草，才能使鸣、放沿着正确的轨道前进，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地！
    可是，陆定一这个历史的小丑，就象蝙蝠害怕阳光一样，害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。他一贯疯狂地诋毁、攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，千方百计地阻挠、破坏工农兵群众掌握伟大的毛泽东思想。在百花齐放、百家争鸣这个问题上，他又凶恶地挥舞起“反对教条主义”的大棒，妄图抵制毛泽东思想的绝对领导，把鸣、放引向修正主义的邪路。他恶毒攻击建国以后以毛泽东思想为指针，批判反动影片《武训传》的斗争、批判《红楼梦研究》以及批判胡适的反动思想的斗争、批判胡风反革命集团的斗争，是“教条主义”，是“阿Q精神”，有“阴暗面”，造成“脑子僵化”、“死气沉沉”、“停滞”、“倒退”，甚至恶毒的诬蔑毛泽东思想是“新的标签”，“是如来佛的掌心”。他咬牙切齿地叫嚷“必须坚决地同教条主义进行斗争”。
    陆定一这个反动透顶的家伙，所攻击的“教条主义”，不是别的，正是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想最根本的东西。他所叫嚷的“大解放”，要逃出“如来佛的掌心”，就是要离开马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的轨道，就是要修正主义的大解放。
    陆定一这种叫嚷，绝不是孤立的现象。当时，赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团和中国最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打着反对“个人迷信”、反对“教条主义”的旗号，掀起了攻击马克思列宁主义，攻击无产阶级专政的修正主义风潮。就在国际共产主义运动前进的航程上一时迷雾重重的关键时刻，我们的伟大舵手毛主席，以他最坚定的无产阶级立场，高瞻远瞩的政治眼光，拨开迷雾，指明方向，发出了伟大的号召：“在现在的情况下，修正主义是比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”
    因此，我们必须按照毛主席的教导，运用百花齐放、百家争鸣这一锐利的武器，对一切资产阶级思想、修正主义思想进行彻底的批判，大力扶植一切拥护、热爱和歌颂毛泽东思想的香花，铲除一切篡改、反对和攻击毛泽东思想的毒草，在意识形态领域内大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，十多年来，歪曲百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，大肆推行资产阶级自由化，积极为复辟资本主义制造反革命舆论。欠债必须偿还，我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把陆定一之流十多年来所散布的妖风迷雾，坚决、彻底、全部地扫荡干净，让毛主席的百花齐放、百家争鸣的伟大思想在中国人民和世界人民的心中永放光芒！
