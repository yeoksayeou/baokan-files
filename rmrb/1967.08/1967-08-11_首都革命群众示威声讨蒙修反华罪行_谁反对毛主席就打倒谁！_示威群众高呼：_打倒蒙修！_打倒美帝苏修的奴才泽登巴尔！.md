In recent days, revolutionary masses and Red Guards in the capital have gathered in large numbers in front of the Mongolian Embassy in China to protest and condemn the outrageous insults made by Mongolian embassy staff against the portrait of our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary masses and Red Guards in the capital have sternly pointed out that the Mongolian revisionist leadership, driven by their reactionary nature, closely follows the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, consistently hates and opposes our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and fiercely opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Mongolian embassy staff's insult to Chairman Mao's portrait in our capital is not an isolated incident; it is another serious political provocation they have created.

On the morning of August 9, near Donghua Gate in Beijing, a Mongolian embassy staff member named Dashiyuertei trampled on the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao inside the car he was driving. This was immediately noticed by passing revolutionaries. The revolutionaries on the spot pointed out his serious criminal behavior and demanded that he confess and apologize. The Mongolian staff member ignored the revolutionaries' stern demands and made various despicable gestures to provoke them. The revolutionaries were extremely indignant at the Mongolian embassy staff's criminal behavior and arrogant attitude, and they absolutely would not tolerate it. While protesting, they held the red revolutionary classic, repeatedly reading Chairman Mao's quotations and chanting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Red Guards and revolutionary workers who went to protest in front of the Mongolian Embassy wrote many large banners and protest letters on the walls and ground in front of the embassy, exposing the ugly faces of the Mongolian revisionists who follow the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their frenzied anti-China activities. The protesters continuously raised their arms and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with Mongolian revisionism!" "Down with the lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal!" "All anti-China elements will meet a bad end!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

In the afternoon of August 9, a responsible official from the Protocol Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Mongolian Ambassador to China, Tsevegmid, to lodge the strongest protest against the Mongolian embassy staff's insult to the portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and their political provocation against our revolutionaries. The official demanded that they take full responsibility for all consequences of this serious incident.

    首都革命群众和红卫兵小将严正指出，蒙修领导集团出于他们的反动本性，紧紧追随美帝和苏修，一贯仇视和反对我们伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一贯疯狂地反对中国无产阶级文化大革命。蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员竟在我们首都侮辱毛主席像，绝不是偶然的，这是他们制造的又一严重的政治挑衅事件。
    八月九日上午，在北京东华门附近，蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员达希敖额尔特在他所驾驶的汽车内踩踏我们伟大领袖毛主席的像。当即被过路的革命群众发现。革命群众当场向这个工作人员指出了他的严重犯罪行为，要他认罪、道歉。蒙古工作人员无视我革命群众的严正要求，并作出种种卑鄙的动作进行挑衅。我革命群众对蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员的犯罪行为和横蛮态度，万分愤慨，表示绝对不能容忍。他们在提出抗议时，手捧红色革命宝书，一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录，高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号。
    前往蒙古驻中国大使馆前示威的红卫兵小将和革命职工，在蒙古大使馆门前的墙上和地上刷写了许多张大标语和抗议书，揭露了蒙修追随美帝、苏修疯狂反华的丑恶嘴脸。示威的人们不断地振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒蒙修！”“打倒美帝、苏修的奴才泽登巴尔！”“一切反华的人决没有好下场！”“我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    九日下午，我国外交部礼宾司负责人召见蒙古驻中国大使策伯格米德，就蒙古驻中国大使馆工作人员侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像和向我革命群众进行政治挑衅的罪行，向策伯格米德提出了最严重的抗议，并要他们对这一严重事件的一切后果负完全的责任。
