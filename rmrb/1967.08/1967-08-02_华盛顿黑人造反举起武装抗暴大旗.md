Washington Blacks Rebel and Raise the Banner of Armed Resistance Against Violence

	Groups of blacks, less than a mile from the White House, smash police cars and bravely resist police suppression.
	The armed resistance against violence by blacks in the center of U.S. rule has caused the U.S. authorities to panic and be in a state of shock.
	New China News Agency, August 1st: The flames of the black resistance against violence in the United States are burning more fiercely. On the night of July 31st to the early morning of August 1st, the blacks in the U.S. capital, Washington, also rebelled. Groups of blacks, less than a mile from Johnson's White House and the Capitol, opened fire on the police who were rampaging, smashed police cars, and burned shops. The armed resistance against violence by blacks in Washington is the first in history, which has caused the U.S. authorities to panic and be in a state of shock.

	The direct cause of this struggle is the police's arbitrary arrest of a black person; but the fundamental reason is the long-term exploitation and oppression of blacks. Blacks make up two-thirds of Washington's population, and their economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, and social discrimination are even worse than in other cities. They have long been strongly dissatisfied with this.

	Starting from the night of July 31st, blacks formed groups of fifty or sixty and engaged in fierce battles with the armed police suppressing their resistance. Some used guns to shoot, some used a barrage of stones and bricks to strike the police, and some set fire to police cars and shops owned by white racists. The police arrested fifty blacks, but other blacks continued the struggle until this morning.

	While blacks in Washington are bravely fighting, the black struggle in many other U.S. cities is also continuing to develop. The black resistance against violence in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which began on July 30th, was still ongoing by the morning of August 1st. The reactionary authorities, fearing that this city would become "another Detroit," deployed more than six thousand armed police and military personnel, and dozens of armored cars equipped with machine guns, to suppress a few hundred protesting blacks. The police and military surrounded the black neighborhood and imposed a curfew, cutting off all traffic in the city. In two days, they injured more than a hundred blacks and arrested more than two hundred and sixty. However, this did not suppress the black struggle. According to reports from U.S. news agencies, by noon on July 31st, the gunshots from black snipers were becoming more frequent, killing and injuring thirteen police officers, and setting fire to more than seventy places in the city. The police and military commander had to admit that the situation was "explosive" and anxiously said, "We don't know what will happen."

	Blacks in Portland, Oregon, also engaged in resistance against violence on the nights of July 30th and 31st. They attacked the police with stones, glass bottles, and Molotov cocktails, and burned warehouses. Facing the "most serious racial riot in the city's history," the mayor of this city ordered the city to be sealed off and frantically demanded to "arrest as many as possible."

	In addition, on July 30th and 31st, new black struggles broke out in many cities such as Cleveland, Ohio, Rockford, Illinois, San Bernardino, California, Erie, Pennsylvania, and Providence, Rhode Island. The scale of these struggles varied, but almost all adopted the form of violent self-defense: those with guns used them to shoot, and those without guns used bricks and stones to strike the rampaging police. In Newark, New Jersey, where large-scale black violent self-defense struggles broke out in mid-July, a black mass meeting was held on July 31st. A black writer warned the racist authorities at the meeting that if they did not stop their atrocities against blacks, the next time, the black struggle would turn into a revolution.

### 华盛顿黑人造反举起武装抗暴大旗

    华盛顿黑人造反举起武装抗暴大旗
    一队一队黑人在离白宫不到一英里处砸警车英勇抗击警察的镇压
    美帝统治中心爆发黑人武装抗暴斗争使美当局张惶失措惊魂不定
    新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火越烧越旺。七月三十一日夜间到八月一日清晨，美国首都华盛顿的黑人也起来造反了。一队一队的黑人就在离约翰逊的白宫及国会大厦不到一英里的地方，开枪袭击行凶肆虐的警察，砸警车，烧店铺。在华盛顿爆发黑人武装抗暴斗争，在历史上还是第一次，这使得美国当局张惶失措，惊魂不定。
    这场斗争的直接起因是由于警察无故逮捕一名黑人；但根本原因在于黑人的长期受剥削、受压迫。华盛顿的黑人居民占全市人口的三分之二，他们在经济上受剥削、在政治上无权、在社会生活中受歧视的情况，比其他城市的黑人有过之而无不及。对此，他们早就强烈不满。
    从七月三十一日夜间开始，黑人们五六十人结成一队，同镇压他们抗暴示威的武装警察展开了激烈的搏斗，他们有的用枪射击，有的用雨点般的石块、砖头痛击警察，并放火烧了一些警车和一些白人种族主义者的店铺。警察逮捕了五十名黑人，但其他黑人坚持斗争直到今天清晨。
    在华盛顿黑人英勇斗争的同时，美国其他许多城市的黑人斗争也正在继续发展。七月三十日开始的威斯康星州密尔沃基市的黑人抗暴斗争，到八月一日晨还在坚持中。反动当局担心这个城市成为“另一个底特律”，它出动了六千多名武装军警，一二十辆配备机枪的装甲车，来镇压几百名示威黑人。军警把黑人区团团围住，并实行日夜戒严，断绝了市内一切交通。两天来，他们打伤了一百多名黑人，逮捕了二百六十多人。但是，这并没有能把黑人斗争压下去。据美国通讯社报道，到七月三十一日中午，黑人狙击手的枪声越来越密，打死打伤警察十三人，市内七十多处起火。指挥镇压的军警头目不得不承认局势是“爆炸性”的，并忧心忡忡地说，“我们不知道要发生什么事情”。
    俄勒冈州波特兰市黑人也在七月三十日和三十一日，连续两晚进行抗暴斗争。他们用石块、玻璃瓶、燃烧弹袭击警察，烧仓库。面对着这个城市“历史上最严重的种族暴乱”，这个市的市长已下令封锁市区，并且疯狂叫嚷要“尽量逮捕”。
    此外，七月三十日和三十一日，在俄亥俄州的克利夫兰、伊利诺斯州的罗克福、加利福尼亚州的圣贝纳迪诺、宾夕法尼亚州的伊利以及罗得岛州的普罗维顿斯等许多城市，又爆发了新的黑人斗争。这些斗争的规模不等，但几乎都采取了暴力自卫的形式：有枪的用枪射击，没有枪的就用砖头、石块打击行凶作恶的警察。在七月中旬爆发过大规模黑人暴力自卫斗争的纽瓦克市，于七月三十一日举行了一个黑人群众大会。一位黑人作家在会上警告种族主义当局说，如果他们不停止对黑人的暴行，到下一次，黑人的斗争就会变成革命。
