The prolonged famine in India has recently worsened, with corpses littering both cities and villages. Millions of Indian people have lost their lives due to the famine.

Why is the famine in India so severe? What is the way out for starving India?

The Indian reactionary authorities shout, "Our fate depends on foreign aid and the rainy season." This means that the Indian people's food problem can only be solved by relying on the charity of American imperialists and the generosity of the weather. This argument is utterly absurd. Hasn't the so-called "aid" from the United States been enough? Over the past decade, the Indian reactionary government has begged the United States for $787 million and 50 million tons of American grain, but the result has been a continuous decline in agricultural production and an even more severe famine. Moreover, how can a country with a population of 500 million people rely on foreign aid to solve its food problem? As for the argument that their fate depends on the rainy season, it is sheer nonsense. The weather in India is not bad every year, but the famine persists year after year, so the problem is not with the climate. The Indian reactionary government's argument is obviously intended to cover up the true causes of the famine in India.

The Indian revisionist communists have put forward a so-called "opinion" on how to solve the famine. They pompously say that they should "eliminate our dependence on the United States" and "carry out fundamental land reform," and so on. But who is going to do all these good deeds? The Indian revisionists, in a roundabout way, still want the Indian people to rely on the reactionary government. This exposes their true colors. The Indian reactionary government is the representative of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, so how can one expect it to carry out genuine land reform? They are originally the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, so how can they get rid of their dependence on the United States? The Indian revisionists' opinions are merely attempts to whitewash the reactionary government and undermine the revolutionary will of the Indian people.

The Soviet revisionists have also come out with their "theories." They say that the difficulties in Indian agriculture are due to "forms of land use and weak chemical industry," and so on. The Soviet revisionists avoid the fundamental issues of the Indian social system and only talk about management methods and agricultural technology. This fallacy not only covers up for the Indian reactionaries but also aims to push forward neo-colonialism in India through so-called "aid."

The severe famine in India is entirely the result of the reactionary and dark rule of the Indian National Congress government. It protects the feudal system internally, develops bureaucratic capitalism, and ruthlessly exploits and oppresses the Indian people. Externally, it relies on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, inviting wolves into the house and selling out national interests, bringing endless disasters to the Indian people. The Indian reactionary ruling class will not and cannot solve the famine problem. The only way out for the starving Indian people is to use revolutionary means to overthrow the imperialism, Soviet revisionism, feudalism, and bureaucratic comprador capitalism that weigh heavily on their shoulders and strive for the complete liberation of the Indian people.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Revolution plus production can solve the food problem." He also says, "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." "We believe that revolution can change everything."

India is a country with a large population and abundant resources. The Indian people are a great people. Through revolution, the Indian people will certainly change their fate of being enslaved and exploited, change their poverty and backwardness, change everything in India, and build a new India where the people are the masters!

    革命能够改变一切

    持续多年的印度粮荒，最近更加恶性发展，从城市到农村，饿殍遍地。数以百万计的印度人民，由于粮荒丧失了生命。
    印度的粮荒为什么如此严重？饥饿的印度出路究竟何在？
    印度反动当局叫嚷：“我们的命运取决于外援和雨季”。这就是说，印度人民的吃饭问题，除了靠美国洋大人的施舍和老天爷的慷慨外，是没有别的解决办法的。这种论调实在荒唐透顶。美国的所谓“援助”，难道还少吗？十多年来，印度反动政府向美国乞讨了七十八亿七千万美元，五千万吨美粮，但结果是印度农业连年减产，粮荒更加严重。而且，印度这样一个五亿人口的大国，怎能依靠外援来解决吃饭问题呢？至于所谓命运取决于雨季的说法，更是胡扯。印度天气并非年年不好，而印度粮荒年年不断，因此，问题也不在气候。印度反动政府的这种论调，其目的显然是要掩饰造成印度粮荒的真正原因。
    印共修正主义分子，提出了一个所谓“解决”粮荒的“意见书”。他们冠冕堂皇地说，应当“消除我们依赖美国的情况”呀，应当“进行根本的土地改革”呀……。可是，谁来干这一大堆好事呢？印修分子转弯抹角，仍然要印度人民指靠反动政府。这就露出了马脚。印度反动政府就是大地主、大资产阶级的总代表，怎能指望它来进行真正的土地改革呢？他们本来就是美帝的走狗，怎能摆脱对美国的依赖呢？印修分子这套意见，不过是为反动政府涂脂抹粉，企图瓦解印度人民的革命斗志。
    苏修集团也出来发表一通“理论”。他们说，印度农业之所以遇到困难，是由于“土地使用形式、化学工业薄弱”等原因。苏修集团回避印度社会制度的根本问题，而只谈经营方式和农业技术问题。这种谬论，不仅是为印度反动派打掩护，而且是为了通过所谓“援助”，在印度加紧推行新殖民主义。
    印度的严重粮荒，完全是国大党政府的反动黑暗统治造成的。它对内保护封建制度，发展官僚资本主义，敲骨吸髓地剥削和压迫印度人民，对外投靠美帝苏修，引狼入室，出卖民族利益，给印度人民带来无穷的灾难。印度反动统治集团根本不会、也不可能解决粮荒问题。饥饿的印度人民的唯一出路，就是要用革命手段，把压在他们头上的帝国主义、苏联修正主义、封建主义和官僚买办资本主义这几座大山统统推翻，争取印度人民的彻底解放。
    毛主席教导我们说：“革命加生产即能解决吃饭问题”。他又说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”“我们相信革命能改变一切”。
    印度是一个人口众多、物产丰富的国家。印度人民是伟大的人民。通过革命，印度人民一定会改变被奴役、被剥削的命运，改变贫困落后的状况，改变印度的一切，建立起一个人民当家作主的新印度！
