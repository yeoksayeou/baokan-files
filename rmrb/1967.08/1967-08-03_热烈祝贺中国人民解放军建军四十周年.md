	Heartily Congratulate the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

	The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon's Congratulatory Telegram

	Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received a congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	The telegram said: "On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon extends warm congratulations to the glorious soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to all the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, to the close comrade of Mao Zedong, Minister of National Defense Lin Biao, and above all to the founder and inspirer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Mao Zedong."

	"The Chinese People's Liberation Army, founded by Mao Zedong, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and guided by the military strategy of protracted people's war as expounded by Mao Zedong, was originally called the Chinese Red Army, later renamed the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. It has gone through a long and tortuous journey and achieved the complete liberation of China."

	"The Chinese People's Liberation Army lives a simple life and maintains close ties with the people. It is a new type of army, a true people's army. It has proven itself invincible in the face of Japanese aggression and the Kuomintang traitorous clique supported by the United States."

	"Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a school of Mao Zedong Thought, directly led by Comrade Lin Biao, and has become a model of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has played an outstanding role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, helping to prevent the restoration of capitalism in China and defending the base of world revolution, China."

	"The existence of a powerful People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, capable of delivering crushing blows to any aggressor, is not only a guarantee for the defense of the People's Republic of China against imperialist aggression, but also a great source of inspiration for all peoples fighting for independence, first and foremost the heroic Vietnamese people. This is why the oppressed peoples of the world look at the Chinese People's Liberation Army with love and hope, while imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries harbor hatred and fear towards it."

	"The example and achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army educate all peoples struggling to liberate themselves from the slavery of imperialism and capitalism: without armed struggle, without a people's army, it is impossible for the people to achieve victory."

	"The further growth and strengthening of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will be a guarantee of the final defeat of world imperialism and the victory of socialism worldwide."

	The Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist)

	Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao received a congratulatory telegram from the National Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist), Jacques Jurquet, Francois Marti, Raymond Garaudy, and Claude Aubron on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	The telegram said, forty years ago, in 1927, to counter the Kuomintang's betrayal and suppression of the Chinese people, the Chinese Red Army was established. From that time on, for a full twenty-two years, the Red Army fought a protracted and arduous struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, Japanese invaders, and American imperialists. In the history of proletarian revolution, there has never been such a long and complex armed struggle.

	The telegram pointed out that establishing revolutionary bases in the Chinese countryside, conducting the Long March to break through the encirclement of the Kuomintang army, and the people's war against the Japanese invaders, and the war of liberation to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary regime and its strong supporter, American imperialism, all these are brilliant examples of the application of the Marxist-Leninist theory of people's war created by Comrade Mao Zedong in long and arduous revolutionary practice.

	The telegram said that the most glorious and decisive achievements of the People's Liberation Army were undoubtedly the victories in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. This victory prepared and guaranteed the victory of the war of liberation, which was a great victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of protracted people's war. The People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, played a role that all peoples striving for liberation should and must take as an example, as the Vietnamese people are doing now in their war of resistance against American imperialist aggression.

	The telegram said, however, after China's liberation and the Communist Party of China's seizure of power, the glorious People's Liberation Army's mission was not yet complete. As early as 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks. ... Besides fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also has to undertake the heavy tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even building Communist Party organizations."

	The telegram said, today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are continuing to carry out their great revolutionary tasks, unstoppably advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the most reliable army of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, stands at the forefront of the masses, wisely executing Chairman Mao's teachings.

	The telegram said, it can be fully affirmed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be carried out to the end, that is, until complete victory is achieved, eliminating all open and covert revisionists from the political stage, smashing bourgeois ideology in all fields, promoting production, and creating conditions for the gradual transition to a communist society.

	The telegram concluded by wishing Chairman Mao Zedong, who stands at the forefront of the world socialist revolution, eternal life.

    热烈祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年
    锡兰共产党中央委员会的贺电
    新华社二日讯　中国共产党中央委员会收到了锡兰共产党中央委员会发来的祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年的电报。
    电报说：“在中国人民解放军建军四十周年之际，锡兰共产党中央委员会向光荣的中国人民解放军全体指战员，向全体中国人民和中国共产党，向毛泽东同志的亲密战友、国防部长林彪同志，首先是向中国人民解放军的缔造者和鼓舞者毛泽东同志致以热烈的祝贺。由毛泽东同志亲自缔造的，受到毛泽东思想哺育的和以毛泽东同志所阐明的长期人民战争的军事战略为指导的人民解放军，原来叫做中国红军，后来改为新四军和八路军，经过了长期艰难曲折的道路，取得了中国的彻底解放。
    “人民解放军生活简朴，同人民有密切联系，是一支新型的军队，真正的人民军队。事实证明：在对付日本侵略者以及对美国所支持的蒋介石卖国集团方面，它是所向无敌的军队。
    “今天，中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想的学校，在林彪同志的直接领导下，已成为活学活用毛泽东思想的模范。中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中起了杰出的作用，有助于防止资本主义在中国复辟，并且保卫着世界革命的基地中国。
    “用毛泽东思想武装起来，能够给予任何侵略者以粉碎性打击的强大的人民解放军的存在，不仅是保卫中华人民共和国免受帝国主义侵略威胁的保证，而且也是所有为争取独立而斗争的人民，首先是英勇的越南人民的取得巨大鼓舞的源泉。这就是为什么全世界被压迫人民怀着热爱和希望看着中国人民解放军，而帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派则对它仇恨和恐惧的原因。
    “中国人民解放军的范例和成就教育着正在为从帝国主义和资本主义的奴役下解放出来而斗争的一切人民，这就是：没有武装斗争，没有人民的军队，人民要取得胜利是不可能的。
    “中国人民解放军的进一步成长和加强，将是世界帝国主义最终失败和社会主义在全世界范围内取得胜利的保证。”
    法国共产主义运动（马列）中央的贺电
    新华社二日讯　毛主席和林彪同志收到了法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会全国书记处雅克·儒尔盖、弗朗索瓦·马尔蒂、雷蒙·卡萨、克劳德·孔贝发来的祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年的电报。
    电报说，四十年以前即一九二七年，为了对付国民党的叛变和对中国人民的镇压，中国建立了工农红军。从这个时候起，在整整的二十二年中，中国红军同蒋介石反动派、日本侵略者、美帝国主义者进行了艰苦的战斗。在无产阶级革命的历史上，从来没有出现过这样长期而复杂的武装斗争。
    电报指出，在中国农村中建立革命根据地，进行二万五千里的长征从而摆脱了蒋介石军队的围剿，以及抗击日本侵略者的人民战争、为了推翻国民党反动政权及其强大的支柱美帝国主义而进行的解放战争，所有这些，都是天才地运用毛泽东同志在长期而艰巨的革命实践中所创造的人民战争的马克思列宁主义理论的范例。
    电报说，人民解放军的最辉煌和最有决定性的功勋无疑是在八年抗日战争中取得的胜利。这一胜利为解放战争的胜利作了准备和提供了保证，这是毛泽东同志的人民持久战的理论的伟大胜利。人民解放军在毛泽东同志的领导下起了一切要获得解放的人民都引以为并且必须引以为榜样的作用，越南人民现在在抵抗美帝国主义侵略的战争中就是这样做的。
    电报说，但是，光荣的中国人民解放军在中国获得解放和中国共产党取得政权以后，它的任务并没有完成。早在一九二九年毛泽东同志就说过：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。……它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”
    电报说，今天，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，正在继续执行他们伟大的革命任务，势不可挡地推进着无产阶级文化大革命。作为无产阶级专政最可靠的军队的人民解放军，在林彪同志的领导下，站在群众的最前列坚守自己的战斗岗位，智慧地执行着毛泽东主席的教导。
    电报说，完全可以肯定，无产阶级文化大革命将进行到底，即直到取得完全胜利，从政治舞台上消灭一切公开的或隐蔽的修正主义者，破除各个领域内的资产阶级思想，促进生产，为逐步过渡到共产主义社会创造条件。
    电报最后祝愿站在世界社会主义革命最前列的毛泽东同志万寿无疆。
