Vice Premier Chen Yi reaffirms China's support for Cambodia's anti-American struggle at a banquet hosted by the Cambodian Ambassador to China

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the evening of the 18th, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, at a banquet hosted by the Cambodian Ambassador to China, Zhang Gang, reaffirmed China's steadfast support for the Cambodian people's just struggle against American imperialism. He pointed out that the schemes of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to sabotage Sino-Cambodian friendship will never succeed.

Ambassador Zhang Gang hosted the banquet to celebrate the visit of Cambodian Foreign Minister Furisara to China.

In his speech at the banquet, Foreign Minister Furisara praised the friendly relations between Cambodia and China. He said that the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people express their deep gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their support in our struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, in maintaining neutrality and independence, and in defending the territorial integrity within our current borders. We wish the great Chinese people greater achievements in national construction and the Cultural Revolution. We have full confidence in the future of the great Chinese people. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, it will defeat American imperialism and all reactionaries and enemies.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that during Foreign Minister Furisara's visit to Beijing, we had friendly and sincere talks, exchanged views on issues of common concern, and deepened our mutual understanding and friendship. We believe that maintaining and developing friendly cooperative relations between the two countries serves the common interests of the peoples of both countries, is conducive to the struggle of the peoples of both countries against the common enemy of American imperialism, and supports the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. It is also conducive to promoting the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa. He said that in the common struggle against American imperialist aggression, our two peoples have always supported and inspired each other. For this reason, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries have tried every means to sabotage the friendship between our two countries, but their schemes will not succeed.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles." The Chinese people follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly support the Cambodian people's just struggle against American imperialism, in defense of national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and will strive to continue strengthening friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.
