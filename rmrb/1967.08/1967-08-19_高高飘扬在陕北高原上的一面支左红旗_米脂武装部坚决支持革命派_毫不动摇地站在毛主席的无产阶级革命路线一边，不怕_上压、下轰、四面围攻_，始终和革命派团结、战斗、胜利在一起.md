The People's Liberation Army Daily reports: The People's Armed Forces Department of Miji County in Shaanxi Province has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary faction. They have been hailed by the proletarian revolutionary students in Xi'an as "the red flag of supporting the left flying high over the Shaanbei Plateau."

In late January this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Yulin Regional Committee staged a fake seizure of power in some areas of the region. These elements directed their attacks at the revolutionary youngsters of the "101" group in Miji County, attempting to label them as "counter-revolutionaries." At this time, the comrades of the Miji County People's Armed Forces Department responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call and threw themselves into the work of supporting the left. They conducted a week of investigations and discussions. Everyone stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, looking at the main trend and the direction of the struggle, and felt that "101" had always been steadfast in executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On January 30, they stood up and publicly declared their support for the "101" group, which was then under attack from all sides. This resolute and clear-cut revolutionary action shocked the entire Yulin Region and greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The public declaration of support for the left by the Miji County People's Armed Forces Department was met with pressure from above, attacks from below, and encirclement from all sides. Some responsible officials in higher-level organizations criticized them for "supporting the wrong side" and demanded that they "correct their stance quickly." A handful of people within the county committee and county people's committee repeatedly urged them to "change their attitude," with some even claiming that they had supported a "reactionary organization." They also incited deceived masses to besiege the armed forces department, shouting slogans attacking the comrades of the armed forces department and publicly abusing them as sitting on the same bench with monsters and demons. The comrades of the armed forces department repeatedly reported their situation to higher-level leadership, seeking support, but each time they were met with rebuffs and criticism.

The environment was extremely difficult, but the comrades of the armed forces department resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions and steadfastly supported the "101" leftist mass organization. All comrades sat before Chairman Mao's portrait, repeatedly studying "Investigation on the Peasant Movement in Hunan." They realized that those who said "101" was a "reactionary organization" and "terrible" had consciously or unconsciously stood on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. They also recalled hardships and sweet memories with the revolutionary youngsters of "101" and listened to their denunciations of the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Political Commissar Cui Xiaotang of the armed forces department said: "Supporting or not supporting '101' is a matter that concerns the interests of the entire people of Miji County and the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I have decided to support them." The cadres all expressed: We will follow Chairman Mao. On March 2, the Miji County People's Armed Forces Department, despite pressure from all sides, once again publicly declared at a mass rally: We resolutely support "101" and stand firmly with "101." Their actions greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The class enemies were unwilling to admit defeat. The more firmly the Miji County People's Armed Forces Department supported "101," the more they hated the armed forces department. They seized on some shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary youngsters, smearing "101" as an "air-raid shelter for monsters and demons," a "rightist rebellion," and a "reactionary organization." They compiled black materials against "101," attempting once again to label the revolutionary youngsters of "101" as "counter-revolutionaries" and use this to crush the armed forces department. In this situation, the comrades of the armed forces department, on the one hand, resolutely supported the revolutionary youngsters of "101," and on the other hand, assisted "101" in conducting open rectification, helping the revolutionary youngsters arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They studied together "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Order of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The revolutionary youngsters of "101" went to the streets and countryside, humbly listening to the criticisms and opinions of the masses, and wrote big-character posters four times to publicly admit their shortcomings and mistakes to the masses. These actions were praised by the masses. The comrades of the armed forces department also enthusiastically and patiently did political and ideological work among the deceived masses, uniting and educating the broad masses, and developing and strengthening the leftist forces politically and organizationally.

The Shaanxi Provincial Military Region believes that the Miji County People's Armed Forces Department is the best-performing county armed forces department in Shaanxi Province in terms of supporting the left.

    “高高飘扬在陕北高原上的一面支左红旗”
    米脂武装部坚决支持革命派
    毫不动摇地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，不怕“上压、下轰、四面围攻”，始终和革命派团结、战斗、胜利在一起
    《解放军报》报道：陕西省米脂县人民武装部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，被西安的无产阶级革命派学生称为“高高飘扬在陕北高原上的一面支左红旗”。
    今年一月下旬，榆林地委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在专区一些地方搞了假夺权。这些家伙把矛头对准米脂县的“一○一”等革命小将，企图把他们打成“反革命”。这时，米脂县人民武装部的同志们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，投入了支左工作。他们进行了一周的调查和讨论。大家站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，看主流，看斗争的大方向，感到“一○一”一直是坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。一月三十日，他们就挺身而出，公开表态支持正在到处受围攻的“一○一”。这个立场坚定、旗帜鲜明的革命行动，轰动了整个榆林专区，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。
    米脂县人民武装部公开表态支左，却遭到了上压、下轰、四面围攻。上级机关的个别负责人指责他们“支持错了”，要“赶快纠正”。县委、县人委内一小撮人，多次要他们“改变态度”，有的甚至说他们支持了“反动组织”，并且挑动受蒙蔽的群众围着武装部闹个不休。街上出现了攻击武装部同志的大标语，公开谩骂武装部的同志是跟牛鬼蛇神坐在一条板凳上。武装部的同志多次到上级领导机关汇报当时的处境，要求给予支持，却每次都碰了钉子，挨了批评。
    环境十分困难，但是武装部的同志坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地支持“一○一”左派群众组织。全体同志坐在毛主席像前，反复学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》。大家看出了，说“一○一”是“反动组织”、“糟得很”的人，已经自觉地或不自觉地站到资产阶级反动路线上去了。他们又和“一○一”革命小将一起忆苦思甜，还听了革命小将控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪恶。武装部政委崔孝堂同志说：“支持不支持‘一○一’，是关系到米脂全县人民的利益，关系到保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的问题。我是支持定了。”干部们都表示：我们要跟毛主席走。三月二日，米脂县人民武装部顶住各方的压力，又在群众大会上再次公开表态：坚决支持“一○一”，坚决和“一○一”站在一起。他们的行动大大地鼓舞了无产阶级革命派的斗志。
    阶级敌人是不甘心失败的，米脂县人民武装部越坚定地支持“一○一”，他们对武装部越恨之入骨。他们抓住革命小将一些缺点错误，硬往“一○一”脸上抹黑，说“一○一”是“牛鬼蛇神的防空洞”，是“右派翻天”，是“反动组织”，大整“一○一”的黑材料，妄图再一次把“一○一”革命小将打成“反革命”，并以此压垮武装部。在这种情况下，武装部的同志，一方面坚决地支持“一○一”革命小将，同时协助“一○一”进行开门整风，帮助革命小将们用毛泽东思想武装头脑。他们一起学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。“一○一”革命小将到街头和农村，虚心地听取群众的批评和意见，还先后四次写大字报向群众公开承认自己的缺点错误。这些行动得到了群众的好评。武装部的同志还热情地、耐心地对受蒙蔽的群众做政治思想工作，团结教育广大群众，从政治上和组织上发展壮大左派的力量。
    陕西省军区认为，米脂县人民武装部是陕西省支左工作做得最好的一个县人民武装部。
