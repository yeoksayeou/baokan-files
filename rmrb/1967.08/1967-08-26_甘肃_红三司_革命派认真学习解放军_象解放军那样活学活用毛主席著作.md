Gansu's "Red Three Commands" revolutionary faction has been earnestly studying the People's Liberation Army, learning from the PLA to actively apply Chairman Mao's works.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 25th, the revolutionary mass organizations under the Gansu Red Rebel Third Command Headquarters have recently launched extensive activities to love and learn from the PLA. They are determined to master the glorious traditions and excellent styles of the PLA, promote the revolutionization of thought and organization, enhance revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and deepen the revolutionary criticism, promote revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the process of fighting side by side with the leadership and soldiers of the Lanzhou Military Region, who firmly support the leftists, the "Red Three Commands" deeply felt that the PLA is most loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They actively apply Chairman Mao's works the best, have the strongest revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and are the best examples for the revolutionary masses. During the "Support the Army, Love the People" activities, they emphasized that to support the PLA, one must first learn from the PLA. Only by believing in and relying on the PLA can one better learn from the PLA.

To help the broad revolutionary masses love and learn from the PLA, the "Red Three Commands" leadership group issued a notice, requiring subordinate organizations to actively apply Chairman Mao's works like the PLA does.

Through learning from the PLA, many organizations under the "Red Three Commands" have, with the enthusiastic and patient help of the soldiers, formed a new high tide of actively applying Chairman Mao's works. The "Daily Reading" study system has been established and persisted in. Criticism and self-criticism have been carried out, and differences of opinion between individuals and between organizations can be quickly resolved using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the method of heart-to-heart talks. The style of modesty and caution, and the spirit of closely linking with the masses have also been promoted. Recently, the "Red Three Commands" leadership group, to better carry out the learning from the PLA activities, once again required subordinate organizations to take measures and make plans to further master the glorious traditions and excellent styles of the PLA, so that every revolutionary fighter becomes like a PLA soldier, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, enhancing revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and becoming vanguards and pioneers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    甘肃“红三司”革命派认真学习解放军
    象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作
    据新华社兰州二十五日电　甘肃红色造反派第三总司令部所属革命群众组织，最近广泛展开热爱解放军、学习解放军的活动，决心把解放军的光荣传统和优良作风学到手，促进思想革命化，组织革命化，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    甘肃“红三司”在同坚决支持左派的兰州部队领导机关和部队广大指战员并肩战斗中，深刻地体会到：解放军最忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，活学活用毛主席著作最好，革命性、科学性、组织纪律性最强，是无产阶级革命派最好的榜样。在“拥军爱民”的活动中，他们强调指出，拥护解放军先要学习解放军，只有相信、依靠解放军，才能更好的学习解放军。
    为了让广大无产阶级革命派战士更好地热爱解放军，学习解放军，“红三司”领导小组发出通知，要求所属组织，象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作。
    通过向解放军学习，“红三司”的许多组织在指战员们热情、耐心的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作形成了新的高潮。“天天读”的学习制度建立起来了，而且做到了坚持不懈。批评与自我批评开展起来了，个人与个人、这个组织与那个组织之间的意见分歧，能以毛泽东思想为武器，用谈心会的方法，很快得到解决。谦虚谨慎的作风，密切联系群众的精神也都得到了发扬。最近，“红三司”领导小组为了把向解放军学习活动开展得更好，再次要求所属组织作出措施，订出计划，进一步把解放军的光荣传统和优良作风学到手，使每一个无产阶级革命派战士都象解放军战士那样，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在无产阶级文化大革命中当先锋做闯将。
