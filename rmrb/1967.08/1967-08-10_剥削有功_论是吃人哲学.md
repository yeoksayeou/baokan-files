Title: The Theory of "Exploitation Has Merit" is a Philosophy of Cannibalism

The Chinese Khrushchev is vigorously promoting the fallacy of "exploitation has merit," shamelessly praising capitalists and heaping insults and deceit upon the laboring people. He rants on about how "the laboring people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it," and "exploitation is not only not a sin but also has merits." This is sheer nonsense, enough to make our lungs burst with anger.

Our factory was originally a private weaving mill. We old workers, who doesn't have a history of blood and tears? Before liberation, many of us started working at the age of eleven or twelve. We would get up at three in the morning to work and wouldn't rest until late at night. Despite working so hard, the capitalists would still find fault, beating and scolding us at will. At that time, we had a saying: "The Spring and Factory's door faces south, the apprentices of Spring and are truly pitiful; soybean cakes and sweet potato flour, eaten in the stomach, spinning around. A day doesn't know how many times to defecate." The capitalists wore silk and satin, leather shoes; we workers, in the cold of nine, had no cotton. The capitalists lived in small villas, covered with duck down; we workers didn't even have a dormitory, just a board on the loom to sleep, no blankets or quilts. The whole year, we worked in the workshop, ate in the workshop, and slept in the workshop. The workshop was dark and damp, with flying cotton dust. Many workers had lung diseases, and when they couldn't get up, they were kicked out by the capitalists.

Our class brothers, how many were worked to the bone, starved to the point of skin and bones, fell ill without money to treat, and were tortured to death? How many were crippled by the capitalists and dismissed? How many were forced to separate from their wives and children, their families destroyed? The bitterness of class, the blood and tears, cannot be spoken or written in a thousand words. We hate the capitalists, we hate the system of exploitation! Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Chinese Khrushchev, why are you so fond of capitalists? Why do you hate us workers so much? Strip off your "old revolutionary" mask, we see through you completely, you are a false revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary!

The Chinese Khrushchev also says, "The more exploitation, the greater the merit," "this merit is eternal." This is sheer bandit logic.

We say, the history of the capitalists' rise to wealth is the history of the workers' blood and tears. The capitalists' paradise is built on the white bones of the workers. Take our factory as an example. The capitalists, apart from eating, drinking, gambling, and scheming against the workers, know nothing and do nothing. Just because they have a few stinking dollars, by squeezing the blood and sweat of the workers, in a few years, they developed from a few machines to hundreds of machines, from small landlords to big tycoons. Marx pointed out: "Capital comes into the world, from head to toe, every pore oozes blood and filth." The "exploitation has merit" theory peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev is completely a "philosophy of cannibalism."

If we follow the bandit logic of the Chinese Khrushchev, then before liberation, the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families in China were the ones who exploited the most, so they must have the greatest "merit" for China, with "eternal" "achievements," right? Today's American imperialists not only cruelly exploit and oppress their own people but also crazily plunder and enslave the people of many countries in the world. So, they must have the greatest "merit" for the world, with "eternal" "achievements," right?

The "exploitation has merit" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev is the voice of vampires and parasites, a complete exposure of his filthy and ugly bourgeois soul, an ironclad proof of his singing praises for the exploiting class, and a counter-revolutionary fallacy he fabricated to attempt a capitalist restoration.

Rise up with a thousand-pound cudgel, beat the falling dog to the ground! We must definitely knock down the Chinese Khrushchev and stomp on him with our feet, so that he never rises again!

    “剥削有功”论是吃人哲学
    天津春和无线电厂　伍联
    中国的赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”的谬论，极力在资本家脸上贴金抹粉，而对我们劳动人民则极尽侮辱和欺骗之能事。他胡说什么：“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”“剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳。”这完全是胡说八道，把我们工人的肺都气炸了。
    我们厂原来是个私营织布厂。我们这些老工人谁没有一部血泪斑斑的历史呀！解放前，我们很多人在十一、二岁就进厂当学徒了。每天从早晨三点来钟起来干活，晚上十几点钟还不让歇息。这样累死累活，资本家还挑刺，说打就打，说骂就骂。那时，我们有这样一个数来宝：“春和工厂门朝南，春和徒工真可怜；大豆饼、山芋面，吃到肚里直打转，一天不知拉几遍。”资本家穿的是绫罗绸缎，西服革履；我们工人数九寒天，身上无棉。资本家住的是小洋房，盖的是鸭绒被；我们工人连个宿舍也没有，在织布机上搭块板，没被没褥。一年到头干活在机房，吃饭在机房，睡觉在机房。机房里阴暗潮湿，棉尘飞扬。很多工人都有肺病，病得起不来了，就被资本家一脚踢开。
    我们的阶级弟兄，有多少累得筋骨折，饿得皮包骨，得病没钱治，被折磨而死？有多少被资本家摧残成了残废而被开除？有多少被逼得妻离子散、家破人亡？阶级苦，血泪仇，千言万语说不尽，写不完。我们恨透了资本家，恨透了剥削制度！我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”中国的赫鲁晓夫，你为什么对资本家那么亲？为什么对我们工人那么恨？剥开你“老革命”的画皮，我们完全看透了你是个假革命，反革命！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫还说：“剥削得越多，功劳越大”，“这个功绩是永垂不朽的”。这完全是强盗逻辑。
    我们说，资本家的发家史，就是工人的血泪史。资本家的天堂是建筑在工人的白骨之上的。还拿我们厂来说吧。资本家除了吃喝嫖赌、算计工人以外，什么也不懂，什么也不干，就是因为他有几个臭钱，靠着榨取工人的血汗，几年内，由几台机器发展到上百台机器，由小财主变成了大富翁。马克思指出：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”中国的赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“剥削有功”论完全是“吃人哲学”。
    如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的强盗逻辑来推论，那末，解放前蒋宋孔陈四大家族在中国是剥削最多的，他们岂不是对中国有最大的“功劳”，有“永垂不朽”的“功绩”了吗？当今的美帝不但残酷地剥削、压迫本国人民，而且疯狂地掠夺、奴役全世界许多国家的人民，他们岂不是对世界有最大的“功劳”，有“永垂不朽”的“功绩”了吗？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论，是吸血鬼和寄生虫的声音，是他那肮脏丑恶的资产阶级灵魂的大暴露，是他为剥削阶级歌功颂德的铁证，是他企图复辟资本主义而制造出来的反革命谬论。
    奋起千钧棒，痛打落水狗！我们一定要把中国的赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，让他永世不得翻身！
