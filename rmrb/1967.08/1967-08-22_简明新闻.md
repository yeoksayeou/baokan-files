A delegation from the Malian government returns to Bamako after visiting China

A delegation from the Malian government, led by Sedou Badjan Kouyate, returned to Bamako on the morning of the 20th after completing a friendly visit to China. At the Bamako airport, Kouyate, the head of the delegation, spoke to the press, enthusiastically praising the great thought of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat.

Singapore left-wing unions protest government closure of unions

Recently, a statement was issued by left-wing union organizations in Singapore, strongly protesting the plot by the U.S.-British imperialist puppet regime of Lee Kuan Yew to close down five progressive unions in Singapore. The statement said that the "Registrar of Trade Unions" of the Lee Kuan Yew regime recently issued an "ultimatum" to the Singapore Printing and Publishing Employees' Union and four other unions, demanding that they complete new staff registration procedures by the 12th according to the so-called "Trade Unions (Amendment) Ordinance," in an attempt to impose the reactionary "Trade Unions (Amendment) Ordinance" on the workers of Malaya (including Singapore).

The statement pointed out that the harassment of the left-wing unions and revolutionary movements in Malaya (including Singapore) by the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime will inevitably arouse broader and more intense revolutionary sentiments among the people.

The U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, Japan, and West Germany are India's creditors

The corrupt and decaying Indian reactionary government, which has sold itself to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is heavily in debt and relies on foreign "aid" to survive. The United States is India's largest creditor, accounting for more than half of India's foreign debt, totaling 25 billion rupees. The "World Bank" and "International Development Association," controlled by the United States, are India's second-largest creditors, totaling 7 billion rupees.

In addition, India owes the Soviet Union 3.86 billion rupees, Britain 4.88 billion rupees, West Germany 3.53 billion rupees, and Japan 1.6 billion rupees. Now, the Indian reactionary government can only beg for debt extensions everywhere. This is the result of the Indian reactionary government's policy of selling out to the U.S. and linking up with the Soviet Union.

    马里政府代表团访华后回到巴马科
    塞杜·巴迪安·库亚特率领的马里政府代表团结束了在中国的友好访问之后，二十日上午回到巴马科。库亚特团长在巴马科机场对报界发表谈话，热烈赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    新加坡左翼工会抗议当局封闭工会
    新加坡左翼工会组织最近发表声明，严重抗议美英帝国主义傀儡李光耀集团阴谋封闭新加坡五家进步工会。声明说，李光耀集团的“职工会注册官”最近向新加坡书报印务业职工联合会等五家工会发出了“最后通牒”，限令它们在十二日以前按照所谓“职工会法令”办理新职员登记手续，妄图把反动的“职工会（修正）法令”强加于马来亚（包括新加坡）工人。
    声明指出，拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团这一批蠢人对马来亚（包括新加坡）左翼工会和革命运动所作的种种迫害，必然激起人民更广泛更剧烈的革命。
    美英苏日和西德等是印度的债主
    卖身投靠美帝苏修的印度反动政府腐朽透顶，负债累累，只得靠外“援”过日子。美国是印度最大的债主，占印度外债的一半以上，达二百五十亿卢比。美国控制的“世界银行”和“国际开发署”占印度外债的第二位，达七十亿卢比。
    此外，印度欠苏修的债务达三十八亿六千万卢比，欠英国四十八亿八千万卢比，欠西德三十五亿三千万卢比，欠日本十六亿卢比。现在，印度反动政府只好到处乞求延期还债。这是印度反动政府推行亲美联苏的卖国政策所造成的恶果。（据新华社讯）
