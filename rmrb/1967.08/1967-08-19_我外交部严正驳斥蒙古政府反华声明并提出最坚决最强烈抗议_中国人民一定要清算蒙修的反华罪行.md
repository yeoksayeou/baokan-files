	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Strongly Refutes the Mongolian Government's Anti-China Statement and Expresses the Strongest Protest
	The Chinese People Must Settle Accounts with the Mongolian Revisionists' Anti-China Crimes

	Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned Mongolian Ambassador to China, Tsebegmid, on the afternoon of the 18th. Regarding the Mongolian government's August 10th anti-China statement, which brazenly attacked the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao, the official lodged the strongest and most resolute protest against the Mongolian government and refuted the anti-China rhetoric in the statement.

	The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau pointed out that the August 10th, 1967, statement by the Mongolian government was a malicious anti-China declaration that went to great lengths to spread lies and slander. What is particularly infuriating is that the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique brazenly attacked Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world, in this so-called government statement.

	The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau emphasized that the Chinese government and the Chinese people are extremely indignant and severely condemn this new crime by the Mongolian revisionist authorities.

	He pointed out that the Mongolian government's statement attempted to deny the crime of the Mongolian embassy staff member, Dash-Oerter, who maliciously insulted Chairman Mao's portrait on August 9th, which is absolutely indefensible. The evidence is overwhelming, and the criminal himself has confessed to the facts and written a confession, receiving the punishment he deserved. In this situation, the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique quickly jumped out, defending the criminal in its government statement and brazenly launching vicious attacks on Chairman Mao. This exposes to the world that the crime of insulting Chairman Mao's portrait by the Mongolian embassy staff was indeed orchestrated and instigated by the Mongolian revisionist authorities.

	The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau went on to point out that the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique has long been frenziedly anti-China. The Tsedendamba clique has consistently followed the Khrushchev revisionist clique, playing the role of a clown in every international anti-China chorus. Mongolian media is filled with anti-China rhetoric, using the most despicable and vicious language to slander and attack the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Meanwhile, the Mongolian government has taken a series of serious steps to severely damage relations between the two countries, continually disrupting economic, cultural, and other aspects of relations, and undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. Especially since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Mongolian revisionist ruling clique, out of reactionary class instincts, is terrified of the Cultural Revolution. To resist the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Tsedendamba revisionist clique has mobilized all its propaganda machinery, attempting to deceive the Mongolian people with frenzied anti-China rhetoric and fabricated lies. They have repeatedly violated international relations norms and diplomatic customs, repeatedly inciting mobs to vandalize the news propaganda windows of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia, restricting the activities of Chinese diplomats, and persecuting Chinese residents in Mongolia. On May 21st, the Mongolian revisionist authorities even mobilized a large number of police and secret agents at the Ulaanbaatar railway station to attack, beat, and create the "May 21st" anti-China bloodshed incident against Chinese embassy diplomats, Xinhua News Agency personnel, and Chinese residents who were going to see off a Chinese teacher. This time, the Mongolian embassy staff member brazenly insulted the portrait of our great leader, Chairman Mao, in the capital of China, which is another serious crime committed by the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique in following their master, the Soviet revisionists, in being anti-China.

	He said that after committing a series of serious crimes against the Chinese people, the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique shamelessly accused China of "destroying" the friendly relations between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples in the August 10th government statement and viciously slandered the Chinese government for pursuing a policy of "great power chauvinism and expansionism." He emphasized that the one who has been pursuing a policy of great power chauvinism and expansionism towards Mongolia is indeed Khrushchev and his followers, Brezhnev and Kosygin. For a long time, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, through the Tsedendamba-led small group of revisionists, has seized all power in Mongolia, controlled Mongolia's economic lifelines, and dispatched tens of thousands of Soviet troops to directly occupy Mongolia militarily.

	He said that countless facts show that it is the Tsedendamba-led small group of people, raised by the Soviet revisionists, who have betrayed the interests of the Mongolian people, sold out Mongolia's "national sovereignty and national independence," and turned the Mongolian People's Republic into a Soviet revisionist anti-China military base. This fact has become increasingly clear to the Mongolian people and the people of the world.

	The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau finally solemnly pointed out that we must warn the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique that every crime they have committed against the Chinese people, the Chinese people will definitely settle accounts for. The Tsedendamba clique, following their master, the Soviet revisionists, in being anti-China, will have no good outcome.

    我外交部严正驳斥蒙古政府反华声明并提出最坚决最强烈抗议
    中国人民一定要清算蒙修的反华罪行
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第二亚洲司负责人十八日下午召见蒙古驻华大使策伯格米德，就蒙古政府八月十日发表反华声明，猖狂攻击中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的新罪行，向蒙古政府提出最坚决、最强烈的抗议，并对蒙古政府声明中的反华滥调作了严正驳斥。
    外交部第二亚洲司负责人指出，一九六七年八月十日，蒙古政府发表的一个恶毒的反华声明，极尽造谣诬蔑之能事。令人极为愤慨的是，蒙古修正主义领导集团，竟然在这个所谓的政府声明中一再猖狂攻击中国人民和世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    外交部第二亚洲司负责人强调说，中国政府和中国人民，对蒙古修正主义当局这一新的罪行表示极大的愤慨和最严厉的谴责。
    他指出，蒙古政府的声明妄图抵赖今年八月九日蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员达希敖额尔特肆意侮辱毛主席像的罪行，是绝对抵赖不掉的。铁证如山，罪犯本人已经在事实面前服罪，亲笔写下了认罪书，受到了应有的惩处。在这种情况下，蒙古修正主义领导集团又急忙跳了出来，在其政府声明中公然为罪犯狡辩，并且猖狂地对毛主席进行恶毒的攻击。这就不打自招地向全世界暴露了蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员侮辱毛主席像的罪行，正是蒙修当局有意策划和唆使的。
    第二亚洲司负责人接着指出，蒙古修正主义领导集团疯狂反华，由来已久。泽登巴尔集团一贯追随赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，在历次国际反华大合唱中充当丑角。蒙古的报刊充斥了反华叫嚣，用尽了一切最卑鄙、最恶毒的语言，诽谤和攻击中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。与此同时，蒙古政府还采取了一系列严重恶化两国关系的严重步骤，不断破坏两国的经济、文化等各方面的关系，破坏中蒙两国人民的友谊。特别是中国无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，蒙古修正主义统治集团，更出于反动的阶级本能，对中国的文化大革命怕得要死。为了抵制伟大的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，泽登巴尔修正主义集团开动其全部宣传机器，妄图以疯狂的反华叫嚣和任意捏造的谎言来欺骗蒙古人民。他们还一再破坏国际关系准则和外交惯例，数次驱使暴徒捣毁我国驻蒙古大使馆的新闻宣传橱窗，限制我外交人员的活动，迫害旅蒙华侨。今年五月二十一日，蒙修当局竟然出动大批警察特务，在乌兰巴托火车站，对前往欢送华侨教师的中国大使馆外交官、新华社人员和华侨进行围攻、殴打，制造了“五·二一”反华流血事件。这次蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员，又公然在中国的首都侮辱我们伟大的领袖毛主席像，这是蒙修领导集团追随其主子苏修反华所犯下的又一新的严重罪行。
    他说，蒙修领导集团对中国人民犯下了一系列严重罪行之后，竟然还在八月十日的政府声明中反诬中国方面“破坏”了中蒙两国人民的友好关系，并且无耻地诬蔑中国政府执行什么“大国沙文主义和扩张主义的政策”。他强调指出，对蒙古实行大国沙文主义和扩张主义政策的确有其人，那就是赫鲁晓夫及其门徒勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流。长期以来，苏修领导集团通过泽登巴尔为首的一小撮修正主义分子，攫取了蒙古的一切权力，控制了蒙古的经济命脉，并且派出数万名苏军，对蒙古实行了直接的军事占领。
    他说，无数事实说明，正是受苏修豢养的泽登巴尔等一小撮人，背叛了蒙古人民的利益，出卖了蒙古的“国家主权和民族独立”，使蒙古人民共和国沦为苏修反华军事基地。这一事实，蒙古人民和世界人民已经看得越来越清楚了。
    外交部第二亚洲司负责人最后严正指出，我们要正告蒙修领导集团，你们对中国人民所犯下的每一桩罪行，中国人民是一定要讨还的。泽登巴尔之流追随其主子苏修反华，决没有好下场。
