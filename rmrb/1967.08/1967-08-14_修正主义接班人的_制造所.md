Under the support and protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been pushing a revisionist line in the sports world. They have been peddling such black goods as championshipism, material incentives, and the primacy of technique, turning many sports teams into "factories" for producing successors to revisionism.

The Shanghai table tennis team has been a key area for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to push their revisionist line. Under their control, the table tennis team has long failed to emphasize proletarian politics. The athletes' daily life is almost entirely "eating—sleeping—playing ping-pong," and they do not even participate in political activities, parades, and rallies in society. The entire team has become a "paradise" where politics are ignored. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road openly shout: "Sports teams are for achieving results, not for being Marxist-Leninist academies. What use is good politics if there are no results?" They fiercely oppose athletes studying Chairman Mao's works and peddle the black goods of the number one careerist within the Party, *On the Cultivation of the Self*.

As soon as we joined the sports team, they "educated" us to "train hard" and "achieve results," but they never talked about how to study Chairman Mao's works and take over the cause of the proletarian revolution. Once results were achieved, titles like "committee member," "representative," and "five-star athlete" came one after another. To win championships, they would spend the state's money lavishly, offering material incentives, giving out candy, increasing salaries, and so on. When they won a match, this bunch of scoundrels would treat us to a meal, but if they lost, they would curse and swear, showing the ugly face of capitalist sports bosses! The plot of this handful of scoundrels is to bring our sports teams onto the capitalist track and make us completely into successors to revisionism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The prophets of imperialism, based on the changes in the Soviet Union, also place their hopes for 'peaceful evolution' on the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Party. We must make the prophecy of imperialism completely fail." We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to further criticize the revisionist sports line, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and turn the sports world into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

    修正主义接班人的“制造所”
    在中国的赫鲁晓夫支持和庇护下，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在体育界推行了一条修正主义路线，大肆贩卖锦标主义、物质刺激、技术挂帅等等黑货，使许多运动队简直成了修正主义接班人的“制造所”。
    上海乒乓队是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行修正主义路线的重点场所。在他们的把持下，乒乓队长期不突出无产阶级政治，运动员一天生活几乎就是“吃饭——睡觉——打球”，连社会上的政治活动、游行集会也不参加；整个运动队，成了不问政治的“世外桃源”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派公开叫嚷：“运动队是出成绩的，不是马列主义学院，政治好，不出成绩有啥用场？”并且疯狂地反对运动员学习毛主席著作，大肆贩卖党内头号野心家的《修养》的黑货。
    我们一到运动队，他们就“教育”我们要“苦练”，要“出成绩”，就是不谈如何学习毛主席著作，接好无产阶级革命事业的班。一旦出了成绩，什么“委员”、“代表”、“五好运动员”，都接踵而来。为了得锦标，他们可以慷国家之慨，大搞物质刺激，请吃糖，加工资，等等。平时比赛胜了，这伙混蛋就请客吃饭，输了就破口大骂，完全是资本主义社会球老板的丑恶嘴脸！这一小撮混蛋的阴谋，就是要把我们的运动队纳入资本主义的轨道，要使我们完完全全地成为修正主义接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义的预言家们根据苏联发生的变化，也把“和平演变”的希望，寄托在中国党的第三代或者第四代身上。我们一定要使帝国主义的这种预言彻底破产。”我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步批判修正主义体育路线，彻底肃清它的流毒，把体育界办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
