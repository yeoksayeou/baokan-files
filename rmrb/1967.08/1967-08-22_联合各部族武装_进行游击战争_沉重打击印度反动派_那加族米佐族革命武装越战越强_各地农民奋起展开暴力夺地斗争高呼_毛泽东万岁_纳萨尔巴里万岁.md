The armed struggle of the Naga and Mizo peoples, who are fighting for national liberation, has recently seen important developments. They have united with the armed forces of other tribes to conduct guerrilla warfare over a wider area, enhancing their combat effectiveness and striking a heavier blow against the Indian reactionaries who have been oppressing them.

According to the *Hindustan Times*, the Naga and Mizo peoples have recently transported large quantities of weapons and ammunition into their mountainous regions and conducted guerrilla warfare training. Equipped with automatic weapons and mortars, they have taken the initiative to launch attacks, advancing from Assam to the neighboring centrally administered territory of Manipur, continuously striking at the reactionary government's military and police forces. The Indian reactionaries are terrified by the brave armed forces of these two ethnic groups and have hastily declared certain areas adjacent to the Mizo Hills in Manipur as "disturbed areas" and "dangerous areas," clamoring to strengthen their counter-revolutionary "security measures" to suppress the armed forces of these two ethnic groups.

However, the revolutionary armed forces of the Naga and Mizo peoples are growing stronger with each battle and have also received support from other tribes. The Kukis and Zeliangrongs of India's Northeast, as well as some tribes in Manipur, have joined the armed struggle for national liberation of the Naga and Mizo peoples. They recently fought two brilliant battles in the Tamenglong area of Manipur, inflicting "heavy casualties" on the reactionary army. After the victory, the armed forces of these tribes posted notices on walls, trees, and telegraph poles, issuing stern warnings to the reactionary military and police.

These two large-scale joint battles have shaken the reactionary rule in areas that the reactionaries had previously considered "reliable." The Chief Minister of Manipur was forced to lead a delegation to Delhi to seek help from the central government. The bourgeois press exclaimed that the Northeast is "facing a new high tide of armed conflict" and that the "Indian government in Manipur is almost collapsing."

According to reports, to further develop the armed struggle, the Naga and Mizo peoples are urgently mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and preparing to launch more fierce attacks against the Indian reactionaries.

New Delhi, August 20 (Xinhua) — Inspired and influenced by the armed struggle of the people of Naxalbari, farmers in many parts of India have launched struggles against landlords' exploitation, seizing land by force.

According to the *Indian Express* on August 14, in the hill areas of Darjeeling district, "a Naxalbari-style movement is quietly emerging." In the village of Harinaghat, over a thousand farmers on August 2 fiercely attacked a reactionary police squad. At that time, the farmers gathered at a dairy farm, demanding the return of land seized by the farm owner. The reactionary police arbitrarily arrested ten farmers and attempted to take them to the police station. The farmers quickly surrounded the police squad. Armed with sticks and other weapons, they bravely resisted the police's suppression. The farmers injured one police chief and five policemen.

In the Mirik area, 22 miles from Darjeeling, impoverished farmers from March to July this year continuously fought, seizing over 400 acres of land from landlords. In the Nilokhi area, tenant farmers had gone on strike, opposing the landlords' cruel exploitation. The *Statesman* of India reported on September 9 that in the border district of Kurupam, "a Naxalbari is emerging." The revolutionary people of this district have risen up to fight the landlords, cutting down trees and cultivating the land themselves.

Indian newspapers say that the Indian reactionary government is also "concerned that a Naxalbari movement may emerge in Bihar." In this state, incidents of farmers seizing land from landlords frequently occur.

In Assam, farmers from various places, numbering about five thousand, recently held a joint demonstration in Karimganj, demanding the return of land. They shouted, "Demand that land be distributed to landless and impoverished farmers," "Long live the great unity of farmers!"

In West Bengal, some masses demonstrated in front of the house of the state government's relief minister on July 30, shouting, "Down with the Congress Party," "Long live Naxalbari," "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    联合各部族武装　进行游击战争　沉重打击印度反动派
    那加族米佐族革命武装越战越强
    各地农民奋起展开暴力夺地斗争高呼“毛泽东万岁”“纳萨尔巴里万岁”
    新华社二十一日讯  新德里消息：正在争取民族解放的那加族和米佐族人民的武装斗争，最近有了重要的发展。他们联合其他部族的武装力量，在更广阔的地区进行游击战，提高了战斗力，更加沉重地打击对他们实行残酷的民族压迫的印度反动派。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》报道，那加族和米佐族人民，最近把大批武器弹药运进他们居住的山区，并进行了游击战训练。他们配备着自动武器和迫击炮，主动出击，从阿萨姆邦挺进到附近中央直属领地的曼尼普尔，不断地打击反动政府的军警。印度反动派被这两个民族的勇敢的武装力量吓得要命，慌忙宣布毗邻米佐山区的曼尼普尔的某些地区为“动乱地区”、“危险地区”，叫嚷要加强他们的反革命“保安措施”，来镇压这两个民族的武装力量。
    但是，那加族和米佐族的革命武装越战越强，并且得到了其他一些部族的支援。印度东北地区的库基族、泽良族和曼尼普尔的一些部族，也参加了那加族和米佐族争取民族解放的武装斗争。他们最近在曼尼普尔的塔门隆地区打了两次漂亮仗，使反动军队“遭受了重大伤亡”。战斗胜利以后，这些部族的武装力量在墙上、树上、电线杆上张贴传单，向反动军警发出严厉警告。
    这两次大规模的联合战斗，震撼了被反动派一向认为“靠得住的地区”的反动统治。曼尼普尔的首席部长被迫率领一个代表团前往德里，向中央政府求救。资产阶级报纸惊呼东北地区“面临着一个武装冲突的新高潮”、“印度曼尼普尔政府已经差不多垮台”。
    据报道，为了进一步发展武装斗争，那加族和米佐族人民正在加紧动员群众，组织群众，准备向印度反动派发动更猛烈的进攻。
    新华社二十日讯　新德里消息：在纳萨尔巴里人民武装斗争的鼓舞和影响下，印度许多地方的农民展开反抗地主剥削、用暴力夺回土地的斗争。
    据《印度时报》十四日透露，在大吉岭县的一些山区，“正在悄悄地出现纳萨尔巴里式运动”。在哈林加塔村，一千多名农民在八月二日痛击反动警察队。当时，农民们集聚在一个牛奶场，要求归还被场主霸占的土地。反动警察无理逮捕十名农民，并企图把农民押到警察局。农民们迅速包围了警察队。他们手持棍棒和其他武器，英勇抗击警察的镇压。农民们打伤一名警察头目和五名警察。
    在离大吉岭二十二英里的米里克地区，贫苦农民在今年三月至七月期间，不断进行斗争，他们从地主手里夺回四百多英亩土地。在内洛地区，雇农们曾经举行罢工，反对地主的残酷剥削。印度《政治家报》九日说，在边境特区的库鲁帕姆地区也“正在出现一个纳萨尔巴里”。这个地区的革命人民起来向地主斗争，自行砍伐树木，耕种土地。
    印度报纸说，印度反动政府还“担心可能在比哈尔邦也出现纳萨尔巴里运动”。在这个邦里，农民从地主手里夺回土地的事件经常发生。
    在阿萨姆邦，各地农民大约五千人，最近在卡尔米甘杰联合举行示威，要求归还土地。他们高呼：“要求把土地分给无地和贫苦的农民”、“农民大联合万岁”。
    西孟加拉邦的一些群众曾经在七月三十日在邦政府救济部长的房子前面示威，高呼：“打倒国大党”、“纳萨尔巴里万岁”、“毛泽东万岁！”
