The British imperialists in Hong Kong brazenly ignored the stern warning issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 20, demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately stop persecuting patriotic news organizations. Instead, they continued their mad persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry, conducting illegal "trials" and issuing unreasonable "verdicts" against patriotic news workers.

On August 29, the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, during their illegal "trial" of Hu Dizhou (chairman of the *Xinwu Daily* and president of the *Hong Kong Evening News*), Li Shaoxiong (director of the Nanchang Printing Company, which prints patriotic newspapers), and Zhou Nuanhui (manager of the Nanchang Printing Company), issued unreasonable "sentences" of three years in prison for each of them. They also ordered the *Xinwu Daily* to cease publication for six months and fined both the *Xinwu Daily* and the Nanchang Printing Company 12,000 Hong Kong dollars each.

The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong are playing tricks, dividing the illegal "trial" of the *Xinwu Daily*, *Hong Kong Evening News*, and *Tianfeng Daily* into three stages. The British authorities have fabricated a long list of baseless "charges" against these patriotic newspapers and patriotic news workers in order to persecute them.

During the nine-day illegal "trial," Hu Dizhou, Li Shaoxiong, and Zhou Nuanhui stood firm on the enemy's "court," courageously exposing the political persecution of the patriotic news industry by the British fascist authorities. They scorned the British "court" and loudly protested the illegal "trial" and "verdict" of the British fascist authorities.

That day, *Hong Kong Commercial Daily* reporter Shen Qilin, who was covering the proceedings in the "court," was also illegally arrested on the spot by the British authorities.

The British authorities' fascist actions in persecuting Hong Kong's patriotic news industry have sparked immense outrage among Hong Kong's patriotic compatriots, who have written to the newspaper to strongly condemn the British authorities' fascist atrocities. They pointed out that patriotic news workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought fear neither heaven nor earth, nor gods nor ghosts, and certainly do not fear the small British imperialists. If the British fascist authorities insist on their course and continue to brutally suppress Hong Kong's patriotic compatriots, they will only bring about their own annihilation.

    捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡
    港英纸老虎拚命作垂死挣扎  疯狂迫害我爱国新闻工作者
    据新华社香港三十日电　港英帝悍然不顾我外交部二十日限令港英当局立即停止迫害香港爱国新闻事业的严正警告，继续疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业，非法“审讯”和无理“判决”爱国新闻工作者。
    港英法西斯当局二十九日在对香港《新午报》董事长胡棣周（兼《香港夜报》社长）、《香港商报》督印人兼承印爱国报纸的南昌印务公司董事长李少雄、南昌印务公司经理翟暖晖三人的非法“审讯”中，无理“判决”三人各入狱三年，并悍然勒令《新午报》停刊六个月，同时还“判决”《新午报》和南昌印务公司各“罚款”一万二千港元。
    港英法西斯当局玩弄阴谋，把对《新午报》、《香港夜报》和《田丰日报》的非法“审讯”分为三个阶段进行。港英当局为了迫害上述爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者，给他们罗织了一大堆莫须有的“罪名”。
    在九天的非法“审讯”中，胡棣周、李少雄、翟暖晖等人在敌人的“法庭”上，大义凛然，愤怒揭发了港英法西斯当局对爱国新闻事业的政治迫害。他们蔑视港英“法庭”，他们高声抗议港英法西斯当局的非法“审讯”和非法“判决”。
    当天，在“法庭”内进行采访工作的《香港商报》记者沈启林，又被港英当局当场非法拘捕。
    港英当局疯狂迫害香港爱国新闻事业的法西斯行径，激起了香港爱国同胞的无比愤怒，他们纷纷向报馆写信强烈谴责港英当局的法西斯暴行。他们指出，以毛泽东思想武装头脑的爱国新闻工作者，天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕，当然更不怕小小的港英帝国主义。港英法西斯当局如果一意孤行，继续野蛮镇压香港爱国同胞，那就只能是自取灭亡。
