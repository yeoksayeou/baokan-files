The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, in 1948, threw out a notorious piece, "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group." This is a counter-revolutionary revisionist news program, a big poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought, which must be severely criticized.

In 1948, the last feudal despotic regime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was like a sinking ship, on the verge of collapse under the impact of the people's revolutionary storm. The Chinese people, who had suffered deeply, were about to be liberated.

China, where is it going? Is it rushing towards the bright path of socialism and communism, or is it heading into the blind alley of capitalism? On this fundamental issue, the struggle between the two lines within the Party became increasingly sharp. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao aimed to carry the revolution through to the end and lead China towards socialism and communism. The reactionary bourgeois line represented by China's Khrushchev, however, stubbornly insisted on pulling the revolutionary wheels backward, aiming to implement capitalism and establish bourgeois dictatorship in China.

The great leader Mao Zedong taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "To overthrow any power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class does this, and the counter-revolutionary class does the same." As a powerful tool of public opinion, the news industry is a crucial department for seizing and consolidating power, and thus it becomes a contested battlefield for the two opposing classes.

In April 1948, Chairman Mao issued the famous "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily." In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao first expounded on the role and strength of our party newspapers, which is to correctly, swiftly, and widely propagate the Party's program, line, policies, tasks, and methods to the people. It is to use Marxism-Leninism to educate the people and raise their communist consciousness, "to mobilize the people to fight for their own liberation."

In this talk, Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the fundamental issue of the mass line in running a newspaper: for whom to run a newspaper, relying on whom to run a newspaper, learning from the masses, learning from practice, and so on. Chairman Mao also taught us that newspaper propaganda must uphold the truth, be clear-cut, and have a proletarian fighting spirit.

In summary, in this brilliant work, Chairman Mao systematically, comprehensively, and profoundly proposed the theory, line, principles, and tasks of proletarian news work, solving a series of theoretical and practical problems in proletarian news work.

Just half a year after Chairman Mao issued the "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party threw out his revisionist news program in direct opposition: "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group." He obliterated the party nature and class nature of newspapers, denying that our party newspapers, before seizing power, were tools for creating public opinion for the proletariat to seize power; after seizing power, they were tools for consolidating proletarian dictatorship. He opposed newspapers run by the masses, advocating newspapers run by experts, opposing the revolutionization of journalists' thinking, and advocating "study behind closed doors" and "cultivate oneself behind closed doors." He openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian line of running newspapers, attempting to turn newspapers into tools of bourgeois dictatorship. After liberation, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party further "developed" and "elaborated" his revisionist news theory. In May and June 1956, he gave three black directives to the news industry. In 1962, he revised and embellished the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group" and threw it out again, widely organizing journalists and editors to study it, causing deep harm in the news industry.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist news program "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group" put forward the central slogan of "serving the readers," which means to run a "people's" news industry. Under this slogan, it obliterates the party nature and class nature of newspapers, cancels the fundamental task of newspapers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, and denies the role of party newspapers as tools for the proletariat to seize and consolidate power. It is a product of the reactionary theory of "class struggle extinction" and serves the revisionist political line of the "people's party" and the "people's state."

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have always regarded newspapers as tools of class struggle. The proletariat openly declares that its newspapers have a clear party nature and class nature. The bourgeoisie, to cover up its reactionary nature, always claims that their newspapers are "super-class" and "serve the readers." In the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group," the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party completely stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, peddling bourgeois news views, and vigorously advocating that newspapers are "serving the readers." He said: "Your only task is to write for the readers, and the readers are your masters," "If the readers say it's good, then your work is done well." Isn't this blatantly obliterating the party nature and class nature of newspapers? Isn't this openly denying that party newspapers are tools of proletarian dictatorship?

In 1957, Chairman Mao profoundly criticized this revisionist thought, pointing out: They deny the party nature and class nature of newspapers, they confuse the fundamental differences between proletarian news work and bourgeois news work, they confuse the news work that reflects the collective economy of a socialist country with the news work that reflects the anarchic state and group competition of a capitalist country's economy.

Chairman Mao taught: "In the period when class distinctions exist in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle." In a class society, it is always the class that runs the newspapers. Newspapers, periodicals, broadcasts, and news agencies all serve a certain class. If they do not serve the proletariat, they serve the bourgeoisie. They are either tools of proletarian dictatorship or tools of bourgeois dictatorship. The news front is a battlefield between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore power and the proletariat's counter-restoration. The fact that the Petofi Club in Hungary carried out counter-revolutionary propaganda before the counter-revolutionary rebellion shows this. The fact that the Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union seized power by first seizing newspapers, broadcasts, and other news fronts also shows this. The fact that the Chinese Khrushchev used newspapers to create counter-revolutionary public opinion during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country shows this even more.

"Readers" are divided into classes. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, however, vigorously advocates that newspapers should adapt to the needs of various readers, saying: "You write for Xinhua News Agency, which is broadcast nationwide, so it is seen by the entire country, including the areas controlled by Chiang and foreigners. You should consider what they need to see, what is too much for them, and what is too little, and estimate these aspects."

This is a pure bourgeois reactionary "reader needs" theory.

According to this fallacy, no matter what the readers need, give it to them. Then, the Communist Party wants to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and liberate the whole of China, while the Chiang bandits want to "exterminate the Communists." The Chinese people want to drive out American imperialism, while American imperialism wants to continue to ride roughshod over the Chinese people. The proletariat wants to abolish the system of exploitation, while the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes want to maintain the system of exploitation. In the world, which newspaper can satisfy the fundamentally opposed needs of these classes? Can our proletarian newspapers satisfy the needs of the Chiang bandits, American imperialism, and all exploiting classes as "readers"?

In fact, this "reader needs" theory is not something new; it is an old cliché that the bourgeoisie and revisionists have repeatedly advocated. At the beginning of the 20th century, American bourgeois journalists advocated: "Newspapers are tools for spreading news and knowledge." In 1923, the American Newspaper Editors Association, as a tool of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, also boasted in the "Newspaper Regulations": "The basic function of newspapers is to express what people do, feel, and think to the whole of humanity." Tito of Yugoslavia, in order to develop capitalism in Yugoslavia, also shouted: "Yugoslavia's newspapers and radio stations have never been and are not propaganda weapons, but basically serve the function of providing news." Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, in order to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union, also vigorously advocated: Newspapers are "true people's platforms" and are "true expressions of social opinion." Truly, birds of a feather flock together! The set of "serving the readers" and "adapting to readers' needs" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is the same kind of goods as the set of tricks played by imperialists and modern revisionists to deceive people with their "super-class" magic.

Chairman Mao long ago pointed out: "Although they advocate in words that literature is super-class, in reality, they advocate bourgeois literature and oppose proletarian literature." Similarly, China's Khrushchev advocates "super-class" news, actually mainly engaging in bourgeois news. Comrade Lin Biao recently pointed out: The so-called people's viewpoint "seems to deny class on the surface. But in reality, it uses this form to cover up its class face, class wishes, class policies, and class behavior, making it easier to deceive the masses." China's Khrushchev's "reader needs" theory is nothing more than using the "readers" as a cover, aiming to make newspapers adapt to the needs of capitalism, serve the bourgeoisie, and serve the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, that is, to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to cover his counter-revolutionary revisionist news program with a Marxist-Leninist cloak, hypocritically said in the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group": "Lenin spoke of the importance of party newspapers," "Lenin wrote the program of the Communist International, and the first item is about party newspapers." However, in reality, he cunningly removed and castrated the essence of Lenin's discussion on the nature of party newspapers. In the article "Conditions for Admission to the Communist International" published in July 1920, Lenin's original text of the first item is as follows:

"Daily propaganda and agitation must have a truly communist character. The organs of the press controlled by the Party must be managed by reliable communists who are truly loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The dictatorship of the proletariat should not be discussed as a familiar slogan, but should be well propagated so that every ordinary worker, woman worker, soldier, and peasant can understand through the living facts systematically published in our newspapers every day the necessity of implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat. In newspapers, in people's meetings, in trade unions, cooperatives, and in all occasions where supporters of the Third International can be utilized, not only should the bourgeoisie and their accomplices be continuously and mercilessly denounced, but also all kinds of reformists."

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, however, dare not quote a single sentence of Lenin's original text, striving to castrate Lenin's thoughts. The purpose is obviously to oppose party newspapers propagating the dictatorship of the proletariat, making the masses understand the necessity of implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat, to turn party newspapers into tools for the bourgeoisie to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, and to oppose party newspapers continuously and mercilessly denouncing the bourgeoisie and their accomplices and all kinds of reformists.

Today, whether newspapers, periodicals, broadcasts, and news agencies are tools of proletarian dictatorship or tools of bourgeois restoration depends mainly on their stance and attitude towards defending and propagating Mao Zedong Thought and towards propagating the Party's program, line, policies, and principles.

In the brilliant work "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The role and strength of newspapers lie in their ability to make the Party's program, line, policies, tasks, and methods quickly and widely known to the people." The work of newspapers is "to educate the masses, to let the masses know their interests, their tasks, and the Party's policies."

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, said: Proletarian newspapers should "strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely run newspapers according to Chairman Mao's thoughts on running newspapers."

This is the highest principle of our proletarian news industry.

Whether to firmly support and vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought or to oppose and resist Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between proletarian newspapers and bourgeois newspapers, between revolutionary newspapers and counter-revolutionary newspapers.

In the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group," the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party did not mention that newspapers should propagate and implement Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line but instead incited journalists to "doubt" the Party's policies, to have journalists "investigate" whether the Party's policies are correct, whether there are any mistakes, and whether there are any shortcomings, and to have journalists show "creativity" in this regard, claiming that the Party does not restrict this creativity. The evil intentions of China's Khrushchev are to attempt to use this set of fallacies to make our newspapers, which should be tools for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, degenerate into tools for him to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to create counter-revolutionary public opinion.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party also wanted us journalists to "investigate various people and various strata" and to reflect "what they dare not say, do not want to say, and cannot say" and to turn "their voices, demands, difficulties, experiences, and even mistakes into news and reports." This is a big conspiracy. Everyone knows that in the liberated areas, under the revolutionary government, and under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the people are proud and happy, and they wholeheartedly support and love the Party and Chairman Mao. We have extensive democratic life, and the people can fully express their opinions and criticisms of the Party and the government's work. Where would there be anything "they dare not say, do not want to say, and cannot say"? Only those overthrown landlords, rich farmers, and other reactionaries, who have lost their former "paradise," are unwilling to die, and harbor deep hatred towards the Party and the people, they have a lot of grievances and are always looking for opportunities to cause trouble. However, under our powerful proletarian dictatorship, they are not allowed to speak or act recklessly. Yet, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party wants to turn the "voices, demands, difficulties" of "various people" and "various strata" (actually those who harbor deep hatred towards the Party and the people, such as landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists) into "news and reports" and publish them in the newspapers. Isn't this blatantly advocating for the overthrown exploiting classes and opposing proletarian dictatorship?

Since China's Khrushchev published his big poisonous weed "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group," every time history reaches a critical moment and class struggle intensifies, he jumps out, directly controls the news industry, uses newspapers to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, strenuously resists and sabotages Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and desperately advocates and promotes his reactionary bourgeois line. He has always instructed newspapers to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian dictatorship principle of "fighting poisonous weeds" and to implement his bourgeois liberalization principle, allowing the poison of the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist elements to spread freely. He opposed Chairman Mao's principle of implementing socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, loudly advocating "to develop capitalist exploitation" and "to protect the rich peasant economy for a long time." In the agricultural cooperativization movement, he even openly carried out anti-"rush" propaganda in newspapers, directing the spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao.

It is particularly worth noting that in 1961, when our country was facing economic difficulties, domestic and foreign class enemies launched a ferocious attack on us. China's Khrushchev once again played his old tune of "investigating" and "doubting" the Party's policies. He personally led journalists to his hometown for so-called "investigations." In 1948, he only incited journalists to "investigate" the Party's policies, but this time he "broke out of the door" and took the field himself. He told the journalists: "The method of 'returning home' is good." "Apart from parents and brothers, there are always some relatives and acquaintances at home who can tell you the truth"; he also said: "When talking, it is best to ask questions, stimulate the masses to speak, and find out the true opinions of the masses. You should also ask some opposite opinions, ask from the opposite side, ..." What kind of people China's Khrushchev wants to tell the truth and what kind of truth he wants to tell is now quite clear! No wonder he repeatedly asked the people he sent down: "How much of the news in your newspaper is true?" He also angrily said: "You report good news but not bad news, only report the good things and not the shortcomings and errors. I don't read your headlines, I don't read them."

All these fully illustrate that in the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group," the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party obliterated the party nature and class nature of newspapers, vigorously advocated "serving the readers," and incited journalists to show "creativity" in finding the "shortcomings" of the Party's policies. The purpose is to make the Party's newspapers, before the national victory, become tools of public opinion against the proletariat seizing power; after the national victory, become tools of public opinion against proletarian dictatorship, against the socialist revolution, and for the restoration of capitalism.

In summary, the "Speech to the North China Journalists' Group" is a genuine bourgeois news program, deliberately opposing Chairman Mao's "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," and is another piece of evidence of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist news program of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and thoroughly smashed his beautiful dream of seizing the news front!

We proletarian news warriors, together with the revolutionary masses of the whole country, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more thoroughly and deeply criticize the bourgeois ideas and news line of running newspapers of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and let the boundless sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine on the proletarian news front!

    把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级新闻纲领拿来示众
    ——批判大毒草《对华北记者团的讲话》
    闻洪宾
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在一九四八年抛出了一篇臭名昭著的《对华北记者团的讲话》。这是一个反革命修正主义的新闻纲领，是一株反毛泽东思想的大毒草，必须痛加批判。
    一九四八年，中国最后一个专制王朝蒋介石匪帮，象一只破船一样，在人民革命怒涛的冲击之下濒临覆没。灾难深重的中国人民就要解放了。
    中国，究竟往哪里去？是朝着社会主义、共产主义的光明大道迅跑，还是钻进资本主义的死胡同？在这样一个根本问题上，党内两条路线的斗争日益尖锐。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线要将革命进行到底，要将中国引向社会主义、共产主义。而以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，则顽固地坚持要把革命的车轮拉向后退，要在中国实行资本主义，建立资产阶级专政。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”毛主席还指出：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”作为强大的舆论工具的新闻事业，它是夺取政权和巩固政权的一个要害部门，因此它就成为两个敌对阶级必争的阵地。
    一九四八年四月，毛主席发表了著名的《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》。毛主席在这篇光辉著作中，首先阐明了我们党报的作用和力量，就是要正确地、迅速地、广泛地向人民群众宣传党的纲领路线、方针政策、工作任务和工作方法；就是要用马克思列宁主义去教育人民，提高人民的共产主义觉悟，“动员人民起来为解放自己而斗争”。
    毛主席在这篇谈话中反复讲到办报的一个带根本性的问题，办报的群众路线问题。这就是为谁办报，依靠谁来办报，向群众学习，向实践学习，等等。毛主席还教导我们，报纸宣传要坚持真理，旗帜鲜明，要有无产阶级的战斗风格。
  总之，毛主席在这篇光辉著作中系统地、全面地、深刻地提出了无产阶级新闻工作的理论、路线、方针和任务，解决了无产阶级新闻工作一系列理论和实践问题。
    就在毛主席发表《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》半年之后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就针锋相对地抛出了他的修正主义的新闻纲领——《对华北记者团的讲话》。他抹煞报纸的党性和阶级性，否定我们党报在夺取政权之前，是为无产阶级夺取政权大造舆论的工具；在夺取政权之后，是巩固无产阶级专政的工具。他反对群众办报，主张专家办报，反对记者思想革命化，鼓吹“闭门读书”、“闭门修养”；他公然对抗毛主席的无产阶级办报路线，妄图把报纸变成资产阶级专政的工具。解放以后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，对他的修正主义新闻理论又作了具体的“发挥”和“发展”。一九五六年五、六月间，他一连向新闻界作了三次黑指示。一九六二年，他又把《对华北记者团的讲话》加以修改粉饰，再度抛出，广泛地组织记者、编辑学习，在新闻界流毒很深，危害极大。
      《对华北记者团的讲话》这个反革命修正主义新闻纲领，提出的中心口号是“为读者服务”，也就是要办“全民”新闻事业。在这个口号下，抹煞报纸的党性和阶级性，取消报纸要宣传毛泽东思想、宣传党的方针政策这一根本任务，否定党报作为无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权的工具的作用。它是反动的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的产物，是为“全民党”“全民国家”的修正主义政治路线服务的。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想从来认为，报纸是阶级斗争的工具。无产阶级公开宣布自己的报纸具有鲜明的党性和阶级性。而资产阶级为了掩盖其反动性，总是标榜他们的报纸是“超阶级”的，是“为读者服务”的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在《对华北记者团的讲话》中，完全站在反动的资产阶级立场上，大肆贩卖资产阶级新闻观点，极力宣扬报纸是“为读者服务的。”他说：“你们唯一的任务是写给读者看，读者就是你们的主人”，“看报的人说好，你们的工作就是作好了”。这不是明目张胆地抹煞报纸的党性和阶级性吗？这不是公开否认党报是无产阶级专政的工具吗？
    一九五七年，毛主席曾经对这种修正主义思想作了深刻的批判，指出：他们否认报纸的党性和阶级性，他们混同无产阶级新闻事业与资产阶级新闻事业的原则区别，他们混同反映社会主义国家集体经济的新闻事业与反映资本主义国家无政府状态和集团竞争的经济的新闻事业。
    毛主席教导说：“在世界上存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸又总是阶级斗争的工具。”在阶级社会中，都是阶级办报。报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社，都是为一定阶级服务的。它不为无产阶级服务，就为资产阶级服务。不是无产阶级专政的工具，就是资产阶级专政的工具。新闻这个阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然占领，彼此之间进行的是一场资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的阶级搏斗。在匈牙利的反革命叛乱中，裴多菲俱乐部在事前大搞反革命宣传的事实，就说明了这一点。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡党篡国，首先是抓报纸、广播等新闻阵地的事实，也说明了这一点。我国这次无产阶级文化大革命揭发出来的中国的赫鲁晓夫利用报刊制造反革命舆论的大量事实，更说明了这一点。
      “读者”，是划分为阶级的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却大肆鼓吹报纸要适应各种读者的需要，说什么“你写给新华社的稿子，是向全国广播的，那就是全国人看，蒋管区的而且外国人也看的。你们就要考虑，他们需要看什么，对于他们，那些东西是多了的，那些又是少了的，要估计到这些方面。”
    这是十足的资产阶级的反动的“读者需要”论。
    按照这种谬论，不管什么读者，他需要什么，就给什么。那末，共产党要打倒蒋介石，解放全中国，而蒋匪帮则要“剿灭共党”。中国人民要赶走美帝国主义，而美帝国主义则要继续骑在中国人民头上横行霸道。无产阶级要消灭剥削制度，而资产阶级和一切剥削阶级则要维护剥削制度。世界上有哪一家报纸能同时满足这些根本对立的阶级的需要呢？难道我们无产阶级的报纸能去满足蒋匪帮、美帝国主义和一切剥削阶级这样的“读者”的需要吗？
    其实，这种“读者需要”论，并不是什么新鲜货色，而是资产阶级、修正主义早就反复鼓吹过的陈词滥调。二十世纪初，美国资产阶级报人就宣扬过：“报纸是传播消息和知识的工具。”一九二三年，作为美国垄断资产阶级御用工具的美国报纸主编人协会，在《报业法规》中也吹嘘过：“报纸的基本功能在于把人们所做、所感、所想表达给整个人类。”南斯拉夫铁托，为了在南斯拉夫发展资本主义，也曾经大叫过：“南斯拉夫的报纸和电台过去从来不是，现在也不是宣传的武器，而基本上是起着提供消息的作用。”苏联赫鲁晓夫，为了在苏联实行资产阶级专政，也大肆鼓吹过：报纸是“真正的全民的讲坛”，“是社会意见的真正表达者”。真是天下乌鸦一般黑！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的一套“为读者服务”和“适应读者需要”的欺人之谈，同帝国主义、现代修正主义者所玩弄的一套骗人的“超阶级”的魔术，完全是一路货色。
    毛主席早就一针见血地指出：“他们虽然在口头上提出什么文艺是超阶级的，但是他们在实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺，反对无产阶级的文艺的。”同样，中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“超阶级”的新闻，实际上主要搞资产阶级新闻。林彪同志最近指出：所谓全民观点，“表面上是否认阶级的。但是，实际上用这种形式来掩盖它的阶级的面貌，阶级的愿望，阶级的政策，阶级的行为，便于欺骗群众。”中国赫鲁晓夫的“读者需要”论，不过是打着“读者”的幌子，目的是使报纸去适应资本主义的需要，为资产阶级服务，为地富反坏右服务，也就是为资本主义复辟制造舆论。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了给他的反革命修正主义新闻纲领披上一层马列主义的外衣，在《对华北记者团的讲话》中虚伪地说：“列宁讲过党报的重要性”，“列宁写的共产国际纲领，第一条就讲党报”。可是，实际上他却阴险地抽掉和阉割了列宁论述党报性质的精髓。列宁在一九二○年七月发表的《加入共产国际的条件》一文中，第一条的原文是这样写的：
  “日常的宣传和鼓动必须具有真正的共产主义性质。党掌握的各种机关报刊，都必须由确实忠于无产阶级革命事业的可靠的共产党人来主持。不应该把无产阶级专政只当作背得烂熟的流行公式来谈论，而应该很好地宣传无产阶级专政，使每一个普通的男工、女工、士兵、农民都能通过我们报刊上每天系统登载的活生生的事实，认识到实行无产阶级专政的必要性。在报纸上，在人民会议上，在工会、合作社中，在第三国际拥护者所能利用的一切场合，不仅要不断地、无情地斥责资产阶级及其帮凶，还要斥责各色各样的改良主义者。”列宁对党报的这个精辟的论述，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却一句也不敢引用。
    显然，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派惧怕引用列宁的原文，极力阉割列宁的思想，其目的就是反对党报宣传无产阶级专政，使人民群众认识到实行无产阶级专政的必要性，就是要把党报变为资产阶级制造反革命舆论的工具，就是反对党报不断地、无情地斥责资产阶级及其帮凶和各色各样的改良主义者。
    在今天，报纸、刊物、广播、通讯社，是无产阶级专政的工具，还是资产阶级复辟的工具，主要看它对捍卫和宣传毛泽东思想采取什么立场、什么态度，对宣传党的纲领路线、方针政策采取什么立场、什么态度。
    毛主席在《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》这篇光辉著作中教导我们：“报纸的作用和力量，就在它能使党的纲领路线，方针政策，工作任务和工作方法，最迅速最广泛地同群众见面。”报纸的工作，“就是教育群众，让群众知道自己的利益，自己的任务，和党的方针政策。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志说：无产阶级报纸要“努力宣传毛泽东思想，坚决按毛主席办报思想办报。”
    这就是我们无产阶级新闻事业的最高准则。
    是坚决拥护、大力宣传毛泽东思想，还是反对、抵制毛泽东思想，这是无产阶级报纸还是资产阶级报纸，是革命的报纸还是反革命的报纸的分水岭。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在《对华北记者团的讲话》中，绝口不谈报纸要宣传贯彻毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反而极力煽动记者“怀疑”党的政策，要记者去“考察党的政策对不对”，发现党的政策是不是“错了”，“有没有缺点”等等，而且要记者在这方面“表现创造性”，扬言“党不限制这种创造性”。中国的赫鲁晓夫的险恶居心，就是企图用这一套谬论使我们的报纸由宣传毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的工具，堕落成为他反对毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和他制造反革命舆论的工具。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，还要我们记者去“考察各种人，各个阶层”，并把他们“心里不敢说的，不肯说的，不想说的，想说又说不出来的话反映出来”，把“他们的呼声、要求、困难、经验以至错误反映上来，变成新闻、通讯”，这是一个大阴谋。大家知道，在解放区，在革命政权下，在无产阶级专政的条件下，人民群众扬眉吐气，心情舒畅，对党对毛主席一千个一万个衷心拥护和爱戴。我们有广泛的民主生活，人民对党和政府的工作有意见和批评可以充分地提出来。那里会有什么“不敢说的，不肯说的，不想说的，想说又说不出来的话”呢？只有那些被打倒的地主、富农等反动分子，他们失去了昔日的“天堂”，死不甘心，对党和人民怀有刻骨仇恨，他们有满腹牢骚话，时时刻刻都在伺机捣乱。但是在我们强大的无产阶级专政下，就是不准他们乱说乱动。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却要把“各种人”“各个阶层”（实际就是那些对党对人民抱有刻骨仇恨的地、富、反、坏、右等反动分子）的“呼声、要求、困难”，“变成新闻、通讯”，登在报上。这不是明目张胆地为被打倒的剥削阶级请命、招魂，来反对无产阶级专政吗？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫自从发表他的大毒草《对华北记者团的讲话》以来，每当历史的关键时刻，每当阶级斗争激化时，总是跳出来，直接控制新闻界，利用报刊大造反革命舆论，竭力抵制和破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，拚命鼓吹和推行他的资产阶级反动路线。他一贯指使报纸抵制毛主席提出的“有毒草就得进行斗争”的无产阶级专政的方针，而实行他的资产阶级自由化的方针，让封、资、修的毒素自由泛滥。他反对毛主席提出的对生产资料所有制实行社会主义改造的方针，大肆叫嚷“要发展资本主义剥削”、“长期保护富农经济”，在农业合作化运动中，他甚至在报纸上公开进行反“冒进”的宣传，把矛头直指我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    特别要指出的是，一九六一年，正当我国经济困难时期，国内外阶级敌人联合向我们发动猖狂进攻。中国的赫鲁晓夫再次重弹他的“考察”“怀疑”党的政策的老调。他亲自出马，带着记者到他的老家去进行所谓“调查”。一九四八年他还只是煽动记者去“考察”党的政策，这次他竟“破门而出”，赤膊上阵了。他对记者说：“回老家”的办法好。“家里除父母兄弟以外，总有一些亲戚、熟人，容易给你说真话”；他还说：“在谈话的时候，最好是提出问题，启发群众说话，摸群众的真实意见。还要提出一些反面意见，从反面问他，……”中国的赫鲁晓夫到底要什么人说真话，要说什么真话，不是十分清楚了么！怪不得他三番五次地责问带下去的人：“你们报上登的新闻，有多少是真的？”他还愤愤地说：“你们报喜不报忧，只登好的，不登缺点、错误。我就不看你们那些头条新闻，我不看”。
    凡此种种，都充分说明，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在《对华北记者团的讲话》中，所以抹煞报纸的党性和阶级性，大肆鼓吹“为读者服务”，煽动记者在发现党的政策的“缺点”上，“表现创造性”，其目的，就是要使党的报刊在全国胜利前，成为反对无产阶级夺取政权的舆论工具；在全国胜利后，成为反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义革命，复辟资本主义的舆论工具。
    总而言之，《对华北记者团的讲话》是一个地地道道的资产阶级新闻纲领，是蓄意同毛主席《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》相对抗的，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的又一罪证。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义新闻纲领，彻底粉碎了他妄图夺取新闻阵地的黄粱美梦！
    我们无产阶级新闻战士，同全国革命群众一起，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加彻底地深入地批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级办报思想和新闻路线，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想的阳光永远照耀无产阶级新闻阵地！
