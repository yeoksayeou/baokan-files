Chairman Mao says: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." This is a great truth of Marxism-Leninism, a guiding light for the Chinese revolution and world revolution. The history of Chinese revolutionary struggle is a history of armed struggle; the victory of Chinese revolutionary struggle is a victory of armed struggle.

Chinese Khrushchev has, for decades, consistently opposed Chairman Mao's thoughts on armed struggle, advocating the "parliamentary road," "legal struggle," and claiming that "all political problems should be resolved peacefully," that we should enter the city with "ballots." This is all nonsense. His evil intention is to make us abandon armed struggle, to engage in "class cooperation" with the enemy. This is sheer class capitulationism and national capitulationism, a blatant exposure of his traitorous face.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. Without revolutionary armed struggle, there is no political power for the people, and thus there is nothing for the people. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always emphasized the building of the people's army. He personally created an invincible people's army and led this army to defeat the three great enemies, establishing a new China under the dictatorship of the proletariat. History has proven: the path of the Chinese revolution is the path of armed struggle. Just as Chinese Khrushchev was vigorously advocating the "parliamentary road" and "legal struggle," Chiang Kai-shek was actively preparing for civil war. In some places, the war had already begun. By June 1946, he launched a full-scale counterrevolutionary attack on our liberated areas, boasting that he would annihilate all our People's Liberation Army within three to six months. Chiang Kai-shek's counterrevolutionary tactics completely expose the fact that Chinese Khrushchev's claim of "resolving all political problems peacefully" is a lie; it declares the bankruptcy of his myth that "ballots" can replace guns. The facts tell us that we must confront the enemy head-on, seize every inch of power, and fight for every inch of land. Reasoning with the enemy is futile. We must use guns and violence against the enemy. The "parliamentary road" is a road to failure, a road to doom.

For forty years, we have followed our great commander Chairman Mao, fighting battles north and south, and have clashed with enemies both domestic and foreign. Every battle was decided by bayonets and grenades. Take, for example, our company's attack on Miyun City in 1948. At that time, there were over 8,000 Kuomintang troops stationed in the city. The enemy, relying on their American equipment, used the city walls, which were over ten meters high, and a three-tiered network of firepower, as well as concrete bunkers around the city walls, to put up a desperate resistance. Our entire company of soldiers and officers displayed the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness, and together with our brother units, after a day and night of bloody battle, finally planted the red flag on the enemy's so-called "stable as Mount Tai," "impregnable" Miyun City. Is this the victory of "parliamentary" struggle? Is this entering the city with "ballots"? Is this "peacefully resolving problems"? No, absolutely not! Revolutionary warfare teaches us: the revolutionary gun is the authority that solves revolutionary problems. The enemy will not surrender unless they are defeated, and the enemy will not surrender unless the gun is pointed at them. Imperialism was driven away by our guns, Chiang Kai-shek's eight million troops were annihilated by our guns. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was overthrown by our guns. Chairman Mao said: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Only with revolutionary armed forces can we defeat counterrevolutionary armed forces; only with revolutionary guns can we eliminate counterrevolutionary guns. If we follow Chinese Khrushchev's "parliamentary road" and abandon armed struggle, our nation's future will be doomed, there will be no dictatorship of the proletariat, and there will be no new China. We will not be fooled by him. We must firmly grasp the gun and carry the Chinese revolution and world revolution to the end.

    让“议会道路”见鬼去吧！
    广州部队某部大渡河连
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”这是马克思列宁主义的伟大真理，是中国革命和世界革命的指路明灯。中国革命斗争的历史，就是武装斗争的历史；中国革命斗争的胜利，就是武装斗争的胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫，几十年来一贯对抗毛主席的武装斗争思想，鼓吹“议会道路”、“合法斗争”，主张“一切政治问题要和平解决”，凭“选票”进城，这完全是一派胡言乱语。他的罪恶目的就是要我们放弃武装斗争，和敌人搞“阶级合作”，这是地地道道的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义，是他叛徒嘴脸的大暴露。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题，没有革命的武装斗争，就没有人民的政权，也就没有人民的一切。我们的伟大领袖毛主席一贯重视人民军队的建设，他亲手缔造了一支战无不胜的人民的军队，并亲自领导这支军队，打倒了三大敌人，建立了一个无产阶级专政的新中国。历史事实证明：中国革命的道路，是武装斗争的道路。就在中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“议会道路”、“合法斗争”的时候，蒋介石却在那里积极准备打内战，有的地方已经打了起来，到一九四六年六月，他便对我解放区发动了全面的反革命进攻，叫嚷要在三至六个月的时间内，消灭我全部人民解放军。蒋介石反革命的两手完全证明了中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“一切政治问题要和平解决”是欺人之谈；宣告了他散布的“选票”能代替枪杆子的神话的彻底破产。事实告诉我们，对敌人只能针锋相对，寸权必夺，寸土必争，讲道理是讲不通的。对待敌人只能用枪杆子，用暴力。“议会道路”是失败的道路，是灭亡的道路。
    四十年来，我们跟随伟大统帅毛主席，南征北战，和国内国外的敌人都较量过，每次战斗都是靠刺刀、手榴弹最后解决问题。就拿一九四八年我们连攻打密云城来说，当时城里驻有蒋匪军八千多人，敌人自恃有美式装备，利用三丈多高的城墙和上下三层的火力网，以及城墙周围的钢筋水泥碉堡，负隅顽抗。我连全体指战员发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲的革命英雄主义精神，和兄弟部队一道，经过一昼夜的浴血苦战，终于把红旗插上了敌人所吹嘘的“稳如泰山”、“固若金汤”的密云城头。这难道是“议会”斗争的胜利？这难道是用“选票”进的城？这难道是“和平解决问题”？不是，根本不是！革命战争教育我们：革命的枪杆子，是解决革命问题的权威。敌人不打不倒，枪杆子不到，敌人不会投降。帝国主义是我们用枪杆子赶跑的，蒋介石八百万军队是我们用枪杆子消灭的。国民党的反动统治是我们用枪杆子打垮的。毛主席说：“枪杆子里面出政权”，只有用革命的武装，才能打垮反革命的武装；只有用革命的枪杆子，才能消灭反革命的枪杆子。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“议会道路”走，放弃武装斗争，我们民族的前途就会被断送，就没有无产阶级专政，就没有新中国。我们绝不上他的当，我们一定要紧紧握住枪杆子，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。
