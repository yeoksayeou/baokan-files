The editorial board of "Red Flag" magazine notes: The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party have, in the industrial sector, pursued a thoroughly counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They vigorously advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, promote profit-seeking and material incentives, and implement "expert management." They oppose the socialist revolution, oppose emphasizing proletarian politics, and oppose the Party's leadership and mass line. This counter-revolutionary revisionist line of theirs is entirely a legacy of the Tito and Khrushchev clique. They attempt to use this line to peacefully transform socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises, to restore capitalism in China.

The Shanghai proletariat, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, they have launched a mass criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. What follows is a record of a criticism meeting.

"The Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle" is a Smoke Screen for the Capitalist Offensive

In February 1957, our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended." Two months later, China's Khrushchev came to Shanghai and blatantly contradicted Chairman Mao, saying, "Now, domestic enemies have been basically eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has also been basically eliminated, and counter-revolutionaries have also been basically eliminated." He went on to say, "We say that the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." This is all nonsense. Take our factory as an example. Several capitalists have been stealing state property on a large scale in recent years, sabotaging socialist economic construction. They photographed property deeds and recorded machinery and equipment in their accounts. Even during the Cultural Revolution, they still kept "reversal accounts." The facts prove that the bourgeoisie will never change their wolfish ambitions and will never willingly give up their paradise. Given the opportunity, they will return to power and restore capitalism. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle to lull the proletariat into complacency and to cover up the capitalist offensive. (Money Jinlong, a machinist from Shanghai Tool Factory)

China's Khrushchev absurdly claims that "the agents of capitalists and the property of capitalists have been handed over, so they are no longer capitalists" and that they can be "promoted" to leadership positions. Based on this black directive, the capitalist-roaders within our factory "promoted" two capitalists to deputy factory directors and eight to section chiefs and workshop directors. These two "promoted" deputy factory directors, before liberation, secretly shipped a large batch of equipment to Taiwan. After liberation, they spread the "five poisons" extensively. During the socialist transformation, they handed over their property on the surface but secretly withdrew funds and sold materials. They also used the method of "seizing power by seizing people, seizing people by seizing their hearts" to corrupt and entice cadres. The bourgeoisie is always attempting to overthrow socialism and restore capitalism. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party wants to promote capitalists to leadership positions, aiming to let the overthrown bourgeoisie return to power, seize our power, and rule over us. He is the backstage manipulator of the bourgeoisie's restoration of capitalism. (Wang Yulong, a worker from Shanghai Switch Factory)

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party absurdly claims that "millions of laborers, led by advanced producers, strive to eliminate backwardness, which is a driving force for the continuous progress of socialist society." This is a thoroughly revisionist fallacy. He wants us to focus only on production and not concern ourselves with politics or the socialist revolution. Socialist society is a society with classes and class struggle. We must eliminate the bourgeoisie through class struggle and develop socialist society into communist society. Class struggle is the fundamental driving force for social development and for the development of socialist society into communist society. China's Khrushchev, however, says that "eliminating backwardness" is the "driving force" for the progress of socialist society. This is an attempt to use simple production struggle to cover up the sharp and complex class struggle, to make us focus only on production and abandon class struggle, to allow the bourgeoisie to attack us, and to implement a great retreat. This is sheer daydreaming! We proletariat must arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, and never become confused about class struggle. We must be proletarian warriors in class struggle and resolutely and thoroughly smash China's Khrushchev's grand conspiracy to restore capitalism. (Qiong Luyun, a worker from Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7)

Profit-Seeking and Material Incentives Are Poison for Peaceful Evolution

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Developing the economy and ensuring supply is the general policy of our economic and financial work." The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party opposes Chairman Mao's directive, wanting enterprises to pursue profit, absurdly claiming that "factories making money is legitimate, and if they don't make money, why open a factory? Private factories do this, and state-owned factories should do the same." The capitalist-roaders within our factory faithfully execute his black directive, giving the green light to high-level products and luxury items that make a lot of money, allowing them to flow freely. They only want us to produce a large number of expensive toys, decorative items, and various kinds of coffee pots, coffee cups, fruit baskets, and stereoscopic mirrors, and they demand them urgently. If the task cannot be completed immediately, they personally supervise the battle. They, however, put up red lights and obstruct the production of agricultural support products and industrial components in every way. We have long since successfully trial-produced plastic shoes and plastic clogs that the masses need, but they do not allow production, saying that this is "not doing the right thing." We respond to Chairman Mao's call to support agriculture by proposing the trial production of plastic sprayers. Workers have requested this for several years, but they do not approve or care. China's Khrushchev advocates profit-seeking, opposes serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and opposes serving socialist construction. He attempts to turn socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises that operate on the principle of "big profit, do a lot; small profit, do a little; no profit, don't do it." (Chen Junlin, a machinist from Shanghai Plastic Products Factory No. 3)

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This means putting revolution first and using revolution to command production. We develop socialist production neither by coercion nor by material incentives, but by Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, by political and ideological work, and by the ideological transformation of the people. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will turn into a great material force, bringing about a leap in production. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party fiercely opposes Mao Zedong Thought, openly advocates material incentives, and absurdly claims that material incentives "benefit production and are in accordance with the principle of paying according to work." What are material incentives? They are revisionism, sugar-coated bullets aimed at the proletariat, and poison for peaceful evolution. We proletariat work actively for socialist motherland and for the liberation of all humanity, not for a few stinking dollars. China's Khrushchev attempts to use money as a shackle around our proletariat's neck, making us follow him down the capitalist path. How vile his intentions are! (Zhou Jingen, a worker from Shanghai Aimin Candy Factory)

An old worker in our factory said well: "Material incentives are a soft knife that kills without blood." China's Khrushchev vigorously advocates material incentives, attempting to make us only care about our own living conditions, abandon the fundamental interests of the proletariat, forget the sharp class struggle of restoration and counter-restoration, and allow them to restore capitalism. In the future, we will lose our heads without knowing how. We proletariat, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not fall for this trick. (Wang Chenbi, an engineer from Yangshupu Power Plant)

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party vigorously promotes material incentives and money-taking-the-lead to corrupt workers and undermine the socialist economy. He repeatedly says that "increasing wages a little," "improving wage treatment a little" will make workers "very active and work hard." Otherwise, they will "work passively and lazily." This is a great slander against the proletariat. The proletariat are the masters of the state. We work actively and creatively. Standing by the machine, observing the world, we have a common ideal: to realize communism in our country and the world as soon as possible. For revolution, we proletariat have the greatest enthusiasm for production. What kind of enthusiasm does China's Khrushchev want to mobilize? His approach can only mobilize the enthusiasm of bourgeois individualism and the development of capitalism. The facts prove that material incentives and money-taking-the-lead can only corrupt people's souls, eliminate vigorous revolutionary spirit, eliminate communist cooperative spirit, create contradictions among the proletariat, and undermine socialist production enthusiasm. China's Khrushchev absurdly says that not "increasing wages a little" will lead to "passive and lazy work." This is a great exposure of his bourgeois soul full of filth! Lenin said: "Doing things for money—that is the morality of the capitalist world." What China's Khrushchev promotes is precisely this capitalist trash. (Liu Xianglian, a fine spinner from Shanghai Cotton Mill No. 12)

China's Khrushchev says that "increasing wages a little" can mobilize production enthusiasm, which is sheer nonsense. The facts in our factory prove that only by grasping revolution and class struggle can we maximize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Previously, our factory was the most enthusiastic unit in the Shanghai Instrument Bureau system in promoting material incentives and money-taking-the-lead, but it still could not complete the state's production tasks. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply carried out class struggle, overturned the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and overturned material incentives and unreasonable regulations. We have fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of workers, exceeding the production tasks of the first half of the year. Under the same equipment conditions, the total production of transistors has increased by twofold compared to the same period last year. Living facts have powerfully refuted China's Khrushchev's shameless lies. (Qiong Luyun)

Promoting the "Expert Management" System and Implementing Bourgeois Dictatorship

The thoroughly reactionary "expert management" line pursued by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party opposes the Party's mass line and has caused great harm to our factory. Our factory was originally composed of more than fifty small factories, with poor equipment and no large machinery. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we, based on Chairman Mao's teachings of self-reliance, hard struggle, breaking superstitions, and liberating thoughts, carried out a great technological revolution. We created more than a hundred土 machine tools, proposed more than two hundred technological innovation projects, and successfully trial-produced many new products. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in collusion with reactionary bourgeois technological "authorities," vigorously suppressed this great revolution. Under the guise of "strict technical management" and "civilized production," they cut and demolished a large number of technological innovation projects and new equipment created by workers, banishing them to the cold storage. They attacked workers' technological innovations as having "little economic significance" and "unsatisfactory effects," calling them "messy" and "irregular." They also copied various regulations from the Soviet revisionists, compiling more than a hundred regulations, with twenty-two kinds of process standards and more than ten thousand words of machine tool standards, using various "tightening spells" to bind workers' heads. They also proposed the "four nos," opposing scientific experiments and technological innovations, binding workers' hands and feet. What they call the "four nos" are: no scientific basis, no trial production; no formal drawings, no action; no engineer's approval, no action; no guarantee, no action. Not only are they not allowed to carry out major technological innovations, but even minor reforms are not allowed. For workers' trial production of new products, they set up layer upon layer of unreasonable checkpoints. In their eyes, workers are not the masters of machines but their appendages. The thoroughly revisionist "expert management" line pursued by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is how they suppress workers and how they strive in every possible way to stifle the enthusiasm and creativity of the worker masses, undermining our socialist construction. (Wu Jinlin, a worker from Shanghai Compressor Factory)

The thoroughly revisionist "expert management" line pursued by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party has deeply poisoned our factory. A handful of capitalist-roaders within our factory, in collusion with reactionary bourgeois "authorities," compiled various unreasonable regulations and implemented bourgeois rule over workers. They, under the pretext of indicators, quality, and so on, set up many inspection, management, deduction, and control regulations, with many deduction methods and especially many inspection and management checkpoints. They implement a set of capitalist management systems. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party want to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management" precisely to attempt to turn socialist enterprises, where workers are the masters, into capitalist enterprises under bourgeois dictatorship. They attempt to manage us into obedient "living machines" so that they can lead us by the nose down the old capitalist road, allowing those bureaucrats and capitalists to ride on our heads again, acting arrogantly, and making us workers suffer twice. This is a pipe dream! It is a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, overthrow and expose the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly criticize and eliminate his poison, and turn our factory into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought. (Wang Yuexian, a female worker from the spinning room of Shanghai Cotton Mill No. 5)

    决不允许把社会主义企业拉到资本主义邪路上去
    ——上海市工人批判会纪要
    《红旗》杂志编者按：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在工业方面，推行了一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义路线。他竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大搞利润挂帅和物质刺激，实行“专家治厂”；反对社会主义革命，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对党的领导和党的群众路线。他的这条反革命修正主义路线，完全是承袭铁托、赫鲁晓夫之流的衣钵。他妄图用这条路线，把社会主义企业和平演变为资本主义企业，使资本主义在中国复辟。
    具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，结合本单位的斗批改，对中国赫鲁晓夫的这条反革命修正主义路线，展开了群众性的大批判。这里发表的是一个批判会的纪要。
    “阶级斗争熄灭论”是掩护资产阶级进攻的烟幕弹
    一九五七年二月，我们的伟大领袖毛主席明确指出：“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”过了两个月，中国的赫鲁晓夫就跑到上海来明目张胆地和毛主席大唱反调，说什么“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本上消灭了，反革命也算是基本上消灭了”，“我们说国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”。这完全是骗人的鬼话。就拿我们厂来说吧，几个资本家最近几年还在大量盗窃国家资财，破坏社会主义经济建设。他们把房产地契摄成照片，机器设备都记上帐。直到文化大革命期间，还保存着变天帐。事实证明，资产阶级决不会改变他们的狼子野心，决不甘心失去他们的天堂。一有机会，他们就要卷土重来，复辟资本主义。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，是麻痹工人阶级的革命警惕性，掩护资产阶级进攻的大烟幕弹。（上海工具厂车工钱锦龙）
    中国的赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“资本家的代理人、资本家的财产都交了，已不是资本家了”，可以“提拔”他们当领导。根据他这个黑“指示”，我们厂党内走资本主义道路当权派，“提拔”了两个资本家当副厂长，八个当上科长和车间主任。就是这两个被“提拔”当副厂长的家伙，解放前夕将大批设备偷运到台湾。解放后，他们大量施放“五毒”。社会主义改造时，他们表面上交出财产，暗地里却抽逃资金，盗卖物资。他们还用“夺权先夺人，夺人先夺心”的方法，腐蚀拉拢干部。资产阶级时时刻刻妄图颠覆社会主义，复辟资本主义。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派要“提拔”资本家当领导，就是要让被推翻的资产阶级重新上台，夺我们的权，专我们的政，把社会主义企业变为资本主义企业。他就是资产阶级复辟资本主义的总后台。
     （上海开关厂工人王裕龙）
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，胡说什么“千百万劳动者在先进生产者率领下为消除落后而斗争，就是社会主义社会不断前进的一种动力”。这是彻头彻尾的修正主义谬论。他要我们只埋头生产，不关心政治，不搞社会主义革命。社会主义社会是一个存在阶级和阶级斗争的社会。我们就是要通过阶级斗争消灭资产阶级，把社会主义社会发展到共产主义社会。阶级斗争是社会发展的根本动力，也是由社会主义社会发展到共产主义社会的根本动力。中国的赫鲁晓夫却说什么“消除落后”是社会主义社会前进的“动力”。这是妄图以单纯的生产斗争来掩盖尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，要我们只埋头生产，放弃阶级斗争，听任资产阶级向我们进攻，实行社会的大倒退。这完全是白日做梦！我们工人阶级一定要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，念念不忘阶级斗争，决不做脱离阶级斗争的糊涂虫，要做阶级斗争中的无产阶级勇士，坚决、彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的大阴谋。（上海无线电七厂氢氧工戎履云）
    利润挂帅和物质刺激是实行和平演变的毒药
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“发展经济，保障供给，是我们的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，对抗毛主席的指示，要企业专门去追求利润，胡说什么“工厂赚钱，这是正当的，不赚钱开工厂干什么？私人工厂为此，国营工厂也为此。”我们厂党内走资本主义道路当权派忠实地执行他的黑“指示”，对赚钱多的高级产品、奢侈品大开绿灯，畅行无阻。他们只要我们大量生产价值昂贵的玩具、装饰品，以及各式各样的咖啡壶、咖啡杯、水果篮、立体镜等等，并且要求急迫，一时完不成任务，还亲自督战。他们对支农产品和工业配件的生产却处处开红灯，百般阻拦。我们很早就试制成了广大群众所需要的塑料鞋、塑料草鞋，他们却不让生产，说什么这是“不务正业”。我们响应毛主席支农的号召，提出试制塑料喷雾器，工人要求了几年，他们不批、不理。中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹利润挂帅，反对为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务，妄图把社会主义企业变成“利大大干，利小小干，无利不干”的资本主义企业。（上海塑料制品三厂机修工陈俊林）
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这就是要把革命放在第一位，用革命统帅生产。我们发展社会主义生产，既不靠强制，也不靠物质刺激，而是靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠政治思想工作，靠人的思想革命化。毛泽东思想一旦掌握了群众，就会转化为巨大的物质力量，带来生产的飞跃发展。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猖狂反对毛泽东思想，公然鼓吹物质刺激，胡说物质刺激“有利于生产，符合按劳付酬的原则”。物质刺激是什么货色？它是修正主义，是向工人阶级进攻的糖衣炮弹，是实行和平演变的毒药。我们工人阶级是为了社会主义祖国，为全人类的解放而积极劳动的，决不是为那几个臭钱。中国的赫鲁晓夫妄想用金钱作枷锁，套在我们工人阶级的脖子上，要我们服服贴贴地跟他走资本主义的道路。其用心何其毒也！（上海爱民糖果厂工人周金根）
    我厂一位老工人说得好：“物质刺激是杀人不见血的软刀子。”中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹物质刺激，企图要我们只关心自己的生活福利，丢掉无产阶级的根本利益，忘记尖锐的复辟与反复辟的阶级斗争，听任他们复辟资本主义。将来脑袋掉了，还不知道是怎么掉的。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，决不上这个当。（杨树浦发电厂技术员王琛璧）
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，大搞物质刺激，钞票挂帅，来腐蚀工人，瓦解社会主义经济。他反复地说，要“加一点工资”、“工资待遇高一点”，工人才会“很积极，努力工作”。否则，就“消极怠工”。这是对工人阶级的极大诬蔑。工人阶级是国家的主人，我们是自觉地、创造性地进行劳动。站在机器旁，眼观全世界，我们有一个共同的理想：要在我国和全世界早日实现共产主义。为革命而劳动，我们工人有最大的生产积极性。中国赫鲁晓夫要调动的是什么积极性？他这一套只能调动资产阶级个人主义的积极性，发展资本主义的积极性。事实证明，物质刺激，钞票挂帅，只能腐蚀人们的灵魂，搞掉旺盛的革命斗志，搞掉共产主义协作精神，在工人阶级中间制造矛盾，破坏社会主义生产积极性。中国的赫鲁晓夫胡说不“加一点工资”，就会“消极怠工”。这是他充满铜臭的资产阶级丑恶灵魂的大暴露！列宁说：“做事就是为了拿钱，——这是资本主义世界的道德。”中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的正是这种资本主义破烂货。
        （上海国棉十二厂细纱女工刘香莲）
    中国的赫鲁晓夫说“加一点工资”才能调动生产积极性，这完全是胡说八道。我厂的事实证明，只有抓了革命，抓了阶级斗争，才能最大限度地激发广大工人群众的生产积极性。以前，我厂是上海市仪表局系统中推行物质刺激、钞票挂帅最卖力的一个单位，但是还是完不成国家的生产任务。无产阶级文化大革命以来，由于我们深入开展了阶级斗争，造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造了物质刺激和不合理的规章制度的反，充分调动了工人的生产积极性，超额完成了上半年的生产任务。在同样的设备条件下，晶体管总产量比去年同期增长了二倍。活生生的事实，有力地驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的无耻谰言。（戎履云）
    推行“专家治厂”制度，实行资产阶级专政
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的反动的“专家治厂”路线，反对党的群众路线，给我们厂造成了很大危害。我们厂原来是由五十多个小厂合起来的，设备差，没有大型机器。一九五八年大跃进当中，我们根据毛主席自力更生，艰苦奋斗，破除迷信，解放思想的教导，大搞技术革命，创制了一百多台土机床，提出了二百多条技术革新项目，试制成功了很多新产品。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派伙同反动的资产阶级技术“权威”，竭力扼杀这场大革命。他们在“严格的技术管理”和“文明生产”的幌子下，大砍大拆，把大批技术革新项目和工人新创造的设备打入冷宫。他们攻击工人技术革新“经济意义不大”、“效果不显著”，“搞土机床不二不三”，是“烂糊货”、“不正规”等等。他们还抄袭苏修的各种法规，编造出一百二十种规章制度，仅工艺守则就二十二种，金工手则一万多字，用种种“紧箍咒”套在工人的头上。他们还提出“四不”，反对科学试验和技术革新，束缚工人手脚。他们所说的“四不”就是：没有科学性，不准试制；没有正规图纸，不准动手；工程师不点头，不准干；没有把握，不准干。不仅不让工人进行大的技术革新，连小的改革也不允许。对工人试制新产品，设立了层层不合理的关口。在他们眼里，工人不是机器的主人，而是机器的附庸。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的“专家治厂”的修正主义路线，就是这样压制工人，就是这样千方百计地扼杀工人群众的积极性和创造性，破坏我们的社会主义建设。（上海压缩机厂工人吴金林）
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的“专家治厂”的修正主义路线，在我们厂的流毒很深、很重。我们厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，和资产阶级反动“权威”纠合在一起，编造各种不合理的规章制度，对工人实行资产阶级统治。他们假借指标、质量等等，订了许多查、管、扣、卡的法规，扣的办法多，查管的关卡也特别多。他们实行的是一套资本主义的管理制度。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所以要推行“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，就是妄图把工人当家作主的社会主义企业，变成为资产阶级专政的资本主义企业。他们妄图管得我们服服贴贴地做“活机器”，以便牵着我们的鼻子走到资本主义老路上去，让那些官僚、资本家重新骑在我们头上，作威作福，要我们工人吃二遍苦，这是梦想！一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们一定要听毛主席的话，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗臭，批深、批透，彻底肃清他的流毒，把我们的工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。（上海国棉五厂筒摇车间女工王月仙）
