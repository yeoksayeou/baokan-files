New Delhi, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian newspapers have revealed that the revolutionary peasants of Darjeeling District's Nasalbari and other regions, led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have used guerrilla tactics to counter the Indian reactionary government's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," resulting in the failure of its first such campaign.

After all its political deception tactics failed, the Indian reactionary government brazenly mobilized several thousand soldiers and police to launch a counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign in the armed struggle areas of Darjeeling District's Nasalbari starting July 6. The reactionaries boasted of isolating the revolutionary faction of the CPI from the masses, "eradicating" the leaders of the armed struggle, "crushing" the armed struggle, and "destroying" the red armed struggle areas. Over the past month, the Indian reactionary government has dispatched large numbers of police, rifle units, and border security forces to launch multiple surprise attacks on armed struggle areas, arresting over 500 peasants. Simultaneously, they have sent soldiers and police into the armed struggle areas, temporarily occupying some places.

Facing the reactionaries' "encirclement and suppression," the peasant revolutionary armed forces are fearless. Before the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," they mobilized the peasants to prepare for "prolonged armed struggle," arming the masses with bows, arrows, and guns, seizing guns and grain from landlords, collecting and storing weapons and food, and eliminating spies in the armed struggle areas. After the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" began, the peasant revolutionary armed forces retreated into the forest areas, utilizing advantageous terrain to disperse their activities. The masses also dispersed. The enemy could not find the peasant revolutionary armed forces, and their attacks often ended in vain. The revolutionary armed forces also seized opportunities to concentrate large numbers of armed peasants for sudden attacks on the soldiers and police, making the enemy extremely disorganized and passive.

After a month of "encirclement and suppression," although Indian official and newspaper sources repeatedly boasted that the revolutionary armed struggle was "near destruction" and that "isolated actions had completely succeeded," even some Indian newspapers openly expressed disbelief, saying that the official claims were premature.

The enemy's plot to annihilate the peasant revolutionary armed forces' fighting strength has been foiled. The armed peasants quickly retreated into the forests, supported and protected by the local people, "moving constantly, frequently shifting from one place to another within a certain area," waiting for opportunities to launch surprise attacks on the enemy. It is reported that on July 13, the armed peasants used firearms and bows and arrows to counterattack a squad of reactionary police invading the red area, injuring six enemy personnel. On July 19, when a squad of police passed through the edge of the Tukuria Forest in this area, more than a hundred armed peasants, equipped with bows, arrows, and guns, suddenly appeared and opened fire on the police. The flexible and mobile actions of the peasant revolutionary armed forces have left the police bewildered.

During the "encirclement and suppression," the reactionary authorities repeatedly boasted that by around July 20, at least some of the "high-level leaders" of the armed struggle would be captured. According to Indian newspapers, "despite the police's efforts to capture them," the whereabouts of the Nasalbari revolutionary faction of the CPI and their top leaders "have not been found." Indian Home Minister Chavan admitted in the parliament on July 24 that after about twenty days of "encirclement and suppression," the "main leaders have not been captured." The Darjeeling police chief acknowledged: "There is no sign that the 'core extremists' are preparing to surrender." West Bengal Chief Minister Mukherjee admitted on July 17: "The leaders of the Nasalbari armed struggle have not been isolated."

The *Hindustan Times* reported that after the "encirclement and suppression," apart from deploying a large number of police in the armed struggle areas, "not much has been done to restore the trust of the local people." The peasants there are "politically aware," and the police cannot make them "repent" from the so-called "extremist ideology" (i.e., Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought).

The armed peasants of Darjeeling have initially achieved victory in the anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle despite the disparity in strength between the enemy and themselves, demonstrating the immense power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The leaders of the armed struggle have publicly declared that this armed struggle is being conducted according to the ideological line prescribed by Mao Zedong. They have no illusions about the Indian reactionaries, are not afraid of threats, and rely on the people to resolutely carry out the anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle. In the struggle, they preserve their strength and wait for opportunities to defeat the enemy. The leaders of the armed struggle have expressed that they will launch large-scale activities during the autumn harvest season. They are confident that the "Nasalbari-style" armed struggle will ultimately flourish throughout India.

The great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, said: "Learning warfare from warfare—this is our main method.... Revolutionary warfare is a matter for the masses, often not a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning. There is a distance between the 'common people' and soldiers, but it is not an insurmountable Great Wall; it is a distance that can be quickly eliminated. Doing revolution, doing warfare, is the method to eliminate this distance." The revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary people will certainly learn warfare from warfare and achieve greater victories in the revolutionary armed struggle.

    纳萨尔巴里农民革命武装坚持游击战
    印度反动政府第一次反革命“围剿”宣告失败
    据新华社六日讯　新德里消息：印度报刊上透露的消息表明，印度共产党革命派领导大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区革命农民，用游击战术对付印度反动政府的反革命“围剿”，使它的首次“围剿”遭到失败。
    印度反动政府，在它前些时候使出的种种政治欺骗手法全部失败以后，悍然出动了几千名军警，从七月六日开始对大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里武装斗争地区进行反革命“围剿”。印度反动派叫嚷要把印共革命派从群众中“孤立”起来，“根除”武装斗争的领导人，“粉碎”武装斗争，“摧毁”红色武装斗争地区。一个月来，印度反动政府出动大批警察、步枪队、边界治安部队，对武装斗争地区发动了多次突然袭击，逮捕了五百多名农民，同时把军警开进武装斗争地区，暂时占据了一些地方。
    农民革命武装面对反动派的“围剿”，毫不畏惧。在敌人“围剿”前，他们就在农民中动员作“长期武装斗争”的准备，用弓箭、枪支等武装群众，向地主夺枪夺粮，收集和储藏武器粮食，在武装斗争地区清除奸细。在敌人“围剿”开始后，农民革命武装转入森林地区，利用有利地形分散活动。群众也疏散了。敌人找不到农民革命武装在那里，袭击经常扑空。革命武装还几次抓住时机，集中大批武装农民突然袭击军警，使敌人十分狼狈被动。
    经过一个月的“围剿”，尽管印度官方和报刊一再吹嘘说，革命武装斗争“已接近被摧毁”，“孤立行动已完全成功”等等，但这种牛皮吹得连有些印度报纸也公开表示不相信，说官方“说这种话未免太早了”。
    敌人妄图消灭农民革命武装有生力量的阴谋破了产。武装农民迅速转入了森林，在当地人民的支持和掩护下，“游动不定，经常在一个地带内从一个地方转到另一个地方”，伺机主动袭击敌人。据报道，七月十三日武装农民曾经用火器和弓箭反击一队进犯红色区域的反动警察，打伤了六名敌人。七月十九日，当一队警察走过这个地区图库里亚森林边缘时，配备着弓箭和枪支的一百多名武装农民，突然出现，向警察开火。农民革命武装这种机动灵活的行动，把警察闹得头晕目眩。
    在“围剿”中，反动当局曾一再吹嘘说，到七月二十日左右，至少某些领导武装斗争的“高级领导人”将被捕。据印度报纸透露，“尽管警察努力想捉拿他们”，但纳萨尔巴里印共革命派和他们的最高领导人的踪迹“仍旧没有找到”。印度内政部长恰范七月二十四日在议会也不得不承认，经过二十天左右的“围剿”，“主要领导人还没有被捕”。大吉岭警察局长承认：“没有任何迹象说明‘核心的极端分子’准备投降”。西孟加拉邦首席部长慕克吉七月十七日承认：纳萨尔巴里武装斗争领导人“还没有被孤立起来”。
    《印度斯坦时报》报道，经过“围剿”，除了在武装斗争地区派了大量的警察之外，“没有做出多少事情来恢复当地人民的信任。”那里的农民都是“有政治头脑的”，警察无法使他们从所谓“极端分子的学说”（即马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想）中“悔悟过来”。
    大吉岭农民革命武装在敌我力量悬殊的情况下初步取得反“围剿”的胜利，体现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。武装斗争的领导人公开宣布，这次武装斗争“是按着毛泽东所规定的思想路线行事的。”他们对印度反动派不抱幻想，不怕威吓，依靠人民坚决开展反“围剿”斗争。在斗争中，他们保存力量，待机破敌。武装斗争的领导人表示，将在秋收季节开展大规模活动。他们确信“纳萨尔巴里式”的武装斗争最终必将在印度全国蓬勃发展。
    世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席说：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。……革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。从‘老百姓’到军人之间有一个距离，但不是万里长城，而是可以迅速地消灭的，干革命，干战争，就是消灭这个距离的方法。”印共革命派和革命人民，必将在战争中学会战争，取得革命武装斗争的更大胜利。
