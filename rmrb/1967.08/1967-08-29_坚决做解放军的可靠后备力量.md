The great call by Chairman Mao to the people of the nation to "support the army and love the people" is a great strategic slogan. It is a slogan to advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a slogan to ensure the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, for comrades of the revolutionary masses, it is particularly important to deeply understand the meaning of Chairman Mao's great call and truly act according to this great call.

In this unprecedented great revolutionary movement, the People's Liberation Army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and has established new merits in preparing for war, defending national defense, and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. An important feature of conducting a cultural revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is that the gun is in our hands, in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The gun is personally commanded by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. Since January this year, the People's Liberation Army, following the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left, has intervened in the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In a series of tasks such as supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, it has established even greater merits.

We, the young Red Guards, should enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from the PLA throughout the country," earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and become the reliable reserve force of the PLA.

We firmly believe that as long as the revolutionary masses of the proletariat firmly unite with the great People's Liberation Army and fight together, we will be invincible and unstoppable, and we will definitely achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (From the editorial of the *Beijing Red Guards* newspaper, August 18)

    坚决做解放军的可靠后备力量
    毛主席向全国人民发出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，是一个伟大的战略口号，是把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进的口号，是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得最后胜利的口号。目前，对于无产阶级革命派的同志来说，深刻理解毛主席伟大号召的含义，真正按照这个伟大号召去做，显得尤其重要。
    在这场史无前例的大革命运动中，人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在备战、保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命等项工作中建立了新的功勋。无产阶级专政下进行文化大革命的一个重要特点，就是枪杆子在我们手里，在我们无产阶级革命派手里。枪杆子是我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副统帅亲自指挥的。自从今年一月份，人民解放军遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的指示，介入地方无产阶级文化大革命以来，在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训一系列的工作中，建立了更伟大的功勋。
    我们红卫兵小将，应该热烈响应毛主席“全国都要学习解放军”的伟大号召，认真地活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，做解放军的可靠的后备力量。
    我们坚信，只要无产阶级革命派坚定地同伟大的人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，那么，我们就会无往而不胜，无坚而不摧，一定能够取得无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利！　（《首都红卫兵》报八月十八日社论）
