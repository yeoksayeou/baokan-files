African friends at our embassy's military anniversary reception hail Mao Zedong thought as illuminating the revolutionary path for African peoples

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, our embassies in Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Tanzania, Guinea, Mauritania, and Uganda held receptions over the past two days to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. African friends attending the receptions enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's military thought and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which Chairman Mao personally founded.

In the Malian capital of Bamako, 400 Malian government officials, military officers, representatives of mass organizations, and representatives from various sectors attended the reception hosted by Liu Helin, the acting charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Mali. Among them were Justice and Labor Minister Mamadou Keita, Trade Minister Ataher Megat, the minister-level representative for Defense and Public Security at the Presidential Palace, Mamadou Diallo, the high commissioner for Youth and Sports, Moussa Keita, and the state secretary for Rural Economy at the Presidency of the Republic, Sara Niar.

At the reception, some Malian friends said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is the guardian of the happiness of the Chinese people and world peace. This great people's army has achieved great merits in the past and will surely achieve even greater merits in the future. Malian friends at the reception shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!"

In the Congolese (Brazzaville) capital of Brazzaville, nearly 500 Congolese friends attended the reception hosted by Li Chen Guang, the acting charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Among the guests were members of the Congolese National Revolutionary Movement Political Bureau, Bukambu, Opengi, and Montor, Commander-in-Chief of the Congolese National People's Army, Ebadepe, Chief of Staff, Kimbuara, Commander of the Gendarmerie, Mabiala, and Commander of the National Militia, Jawala.

At the reception, many friends expressed their boundless love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. Many stood in front of Chairman Mao's statue and poured out their hearts, saying, "Chairman Mao, you are our beloved leader."

A responsible person and members of the National Militia attending the reception repeatedly toasted to Chairman Mao's health, wishing Chairman Mao a long life.

A responsible person from the National Militia said, "Chairman Mao's military doctrine is a beacon illuminating the path of struggle for the world's revolutionary people. I am convinced that people's war and armed struggle are the only paths to liberation for the oppressed people."

A member of the National Militia pointed out, "Chairman Mao said, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is the truth. Without the gun, one cannot retaliate against imperialists and reactionaries head-on."

In the Guinean capital of Conakry, more than 300 guests attending the reception hosted by Lin Bingnan, the acting charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Guinea, included General Di Lansana, a member of the National Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and Minister of the People's Army and Civil Affairs, Mamadou Dou, a member of the National Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and State Secretary for Youth and Public Culture, Mamadou Dou Fou, Minister of Labor, and Karim Fou, Minister of Public Works.

At the reception, guests eagerly sought out Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's badges, and portraits of Chairman Mao. A Guinean friend said, "I deeply admire Chairman Mao because he is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the brilliant revolutionary guide of the people of Africa and other countries. I love to read his works because they illuminate our path forward like a lighthouse."

In the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, more than 500 guests attending the reception hosted by Zhou Bo Ping, the acting charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, included the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mgonja, the Executive Secretary of the Tanganyika African National Union, Msekewa, the National Chairman of the Tanganyika Federation of Labor, Kazimoto, and Deputy Secretary-General, Tando, the Inspector General of Police, Shaidi, the Minister of Operations and Training of the Tanzanian People's Defense Force, Ali Mafudishi, and representatives of national liberation movements in Central and Southern Africa.

African freedom fighters expressed that the liberation of Southern Africa should follow the path of armed struggle—the path of China's revolutionary victory.

More than 200 people from various sectors in Uganda attended the reception hosted by Zhang Li, the acting charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Uganda, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Among them were Ugandan Foreign Minister Odaka, Health Minister Nkutu, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperation Kakungi, Speaker of the National Assembly Patel, and Army Commander and Air Vice Marshal Amin.

In the Mauritanian capital of Nouakchott, after viewing an exhibition of photographs about the Chinese People's Liberation Army, an officer at the reception hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Mauritania said, "China is a great country, and we must learn from China well." Guests gathered around the table displaying Chairman Mao's works, reading and eagerly taking copies of Chairman Mao's works.
