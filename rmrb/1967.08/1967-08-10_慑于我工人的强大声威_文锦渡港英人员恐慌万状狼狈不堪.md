According to a report by the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* on August 8, since August 5, when our workers at Man Kam To bravely confronted the British authorities and forced their officials to sign a "guarantee letter," the British personnel in Man Kam To have been in a state of extreme fear and utter disarray.

The *Wen Wei Po* reported that since the British officials signed the "guarantee letter," the Gurkha soldiers, intimidated by our workers, did not dare to carry weapons for two days. The British police officers on the border were also in a state of panic. The police officer who had been disciplined by the workers did not dare to show his face again and was replaced by another British officer. This new officer did not dare to leave the police station, did not dare to wear his uniform, and appeared extremely terrified and dejected when he saw the workers. In addition to the change of police officers, the British customs "assistant" also did not dare to come to work after the incident. Many Chinese police officers and customs personnel in the British police station were also transferred. The previously arrogant British "Agriculture and Forestry Department" officials even did not dare to come to work. These people, who usually drove their cars all the way to their workplaces, were now terrified and had to get off the car in a remote place where no one could see them and then walk to work.

In recent days, the British police station has even implemented "emergency measures," surrounding the station with iron wire fences as high as a person's head, and adding iron horses outside. The exit only leaves a narrow gap for one person to pass through sideways. All food and supplies can only be handed in from outside. Local patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong mocked that the British had fenced themselves in with iron wire, making it inconvenient for them to enter and exit, which was truly a case of reaping what they sowed.

In addition to fencing themselves in with iron wire, the British police station also installed a layer of steel plates on all windows, making the inside stuffy and extremely hot. The British police officers living inside did not dare to come out for fresh air, resulting in everyone being drenched in sweat, wearing only their underwear, and looking extremely disheveled.

Our workers, who have bravely fought and forced the British to admit their guilt, are in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. They enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations at their workplaces. In the past two days, more Hong Kong workers have joined in studying Chairman Mao's quotations and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Every day, hundreds of people gather together, and the situation is very lively.

Intimidated by our side's power, the British have "properly protected" the quotations of Chairman Mao and the big-character posters against British oppression posted by our workers on the walls of the British "offices" in Man Kam To. This includes the slogans that the British fear, such as "Firmly support the just struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against British oppression," "Solemnly stand as a strong backing for Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots," and "Down with British imperialism," which are still posted on the walls, clearly visible.

### 慑于我工人的强大声威  文锦渡港英人员恐慌万状狼狈不堪

    慑于我工人的强大声威
    文锦渡港英人员恐慌万状狼狈不堪
    新华社香港九日电　据香港《文汇报》八日报道，自八月五日我文锦渡搬运工人勇斗港英当局，迫令它的官员签署“保证书”以后，连日来，港英在文锦渡的人员恐惧万分，十分狼狈。
    《文汇报》报道说，自从港英官员签署“保证书”以后，廓尔喀兵慑于我方工人的声威，有两天不敢佩带枪支外出。边境上的英国警官也十分恐慌。被工人们惩戒过的那名警官，不敢再露面，换来了另一个英国警官。这个警官也不敢步出警署，不敢穿军装，见了工人则表现得十分恐惧与沮丧。除了警官换人外，港英海关的“帮办”事后也不敢上班了。港英警署的许多华警及海关华籍人员也调走了。而昔日气焰嚣张的港英“农林处”官员，甚至连上班也不敢。这些家伙平日大摇大摆地坐汽车直到工作地点，但这几天怕得要死，有的在没有人看见的远处下车后，步行上班。
    这几天来，港英警署甚至实行了“紧急措施”，在警署四周围上高及人头的铁丝网，外面还加了铁马，出口处只留一个仅够一人侧身而过的空隙。所有食物及用品，只能举着传入里面。附近的香港爱国同胞讥笑说，港英用铁丝网围着自己，连出入都不方便，这真是自食其恶果。
    文锦渡港英警署除了用铁丝网围着自己外，全部窗户都安上一层钢板，里面密不透风，闷热异常，住在里面的港英警官又不敢出来乘凉，弄得个个大汗淋漓，光着上身，只穿内裤，十分狼狈。
    经过英勇斗争迫使港英低头认罪的我搬运工人，士气高涨，斗志昂扬。他们在工作地点热烈地学习毛主席著作，高唱毛主席语录歌。这两天来有更多的香港工人参加学习毛主席语录，唱毛主席语录歌，天天百多人聚在一起，情况十分热烈。
    港英慑于我方声威，对于我方工人张贴在文锦渡港英“官署”墙上的毛主席语录及反英抗暴的大字报，都加以“妥善保护”，其中包括港英所害怕的“坚决支持港九爱国同胞反英抗暴正义行为”、“誓作港九爱国同胞坚强后盾”及“打倒英帝”等标语，至今还贴在墙上，赫然在目。
