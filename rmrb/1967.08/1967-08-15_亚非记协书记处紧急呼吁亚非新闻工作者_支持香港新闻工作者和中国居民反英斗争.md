The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association today issued a statement urgently calling on Asian-African colleagues and fighters for liberation to support the struggle of Hong Kong journalists and Chinese residents against the fascist suppression and persecution by the British authorities.

The statement said that the brutal struggle has been going on for more than three months. The struggle began on May 6, when the Hong Kong police, under the direct control of the British authorities, attacked and suppressed striking Chinese workers in the Kowloon area. Since then, the struggle has been developing and has now become a struggle by the broad masses of Chinese residents in Hong Kong against the British fascist authorities.

The statement said that Chinese workers, students, journalists, and residents in Hong Kong resolutely oppose the fascist suppression and persecution by the British authorities and strongly condemn the American imperialist bandits for using the Hong Kong port to launch large-scale aggression against the heroic Vietnamese people.

British imperialists, protecting their own and American interests in Asia and Africa, are very afraid of the strong struggle of the Chinese residents in Hong Kong, which will engulf the entire Anglo-American imperialist rule in the flames of revolutionary struggle. They are particularly afraid that the fearless Chinese workers, students, and residents in Hong Kong are resolutely armed with the correct guiding principles of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought in their anti-imperialist struggle.

The statement pointed out that the British authorities have arrested more than 3,000 Chinese residents, illegally sentenced more than 1,000 people, and cruelly persecuted them, killing many people, shooting at many striking workers, and attacking democratic mass organizations. They are trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames against British imperialism in Hong Kong. The British fascist authorities have found that they are powerless to suppress the surging struggle of the Chinese residents in Hong Kong, and now they are using troops equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, tear gas, and other weapons to deal with the people.

However, no force in the world can intimidate the Chinese workers, students, journalists, and residents in Hong Kong who have stood up to demand justice. They are fighting back against the British oppressors with increasing scale, severely condemning and strongly protesting, and holding mass demonstrations and general strikes by workers, etc. They have paralyzed the British economy and seriously undermined the various efforts of the American imperialists to wage war against the Vietnamese people.

The statement appealed, saying: Colleagues and brothers in Asia and Africa, the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association believes that the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Chinese residents in Hong Kong should receive our full and resolute support, because their struggle is an inseparable part of our anti-imperialist struggle, and their actions directly support their heroic brothers, the Vietnamese people.

The statement pointed out that one of the main targets of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities is the local news industry. After illegally arresting and imprisoning 14 journalists from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch and patriotic newspapers, the British imperialists recently intensified their counterattack against patriotic journalists in Hong Kong. On August 9, they kidnapped five executives from the "Hong Kong Evening News," "Tianfeng Daily," "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," and Nanchang Printing Company, and searched the home of the president of the "Xinwu Daily." The British authorities threatened to seal off these newspapers and printing companies on charges of "incitement."

The statement said that this is another escalation of the fascist atrocities by the Hong Kong British authorities. The British imperialists are trying to use these means to suppress the Chinese press, preventing the news of the heroic struggle of the Hong Kong residents armed with Mao Zedong Thought from being spread around the world, so that the British authorities' fascist savage persecution will not be exposed to the people of Asia and Africa.

Patriotic journalists in Hong Kong have already expressed that they will unite in the face of these savage persecutions and resolutely fight back.

The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association calls on all journalists and fighters for liberation in Asia and Africa to give comradely support and encouragement to their brothers in the struggle in Hong Kong.

The fascist suppression and persecution of the British authorities against the residents of Hong Kong should be strongly condemned.

The British fascist authorities' heinous crime of depriving the right to report the truth should be severely condemned.

All Chinese journalists, workers, students, and other residents who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned must be released unconditionally and immediately.

The British authorities must compensate for the spiritual and material losses they have caused to the Chinese residents.

The news, economic, and political activities of the Chinese residents in Hong Kong, including their legitimate right to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, must be fully guaranteed.

The statement said, let us unite with the revolutionary people of Hong Kong and fight shoulder to shoulder to the end, to uproot American and British imperialism and their running dogs—the modern revisionists led by the Soviet ruling clique and the reactionary regimes of various countries.

    亚非记协书记处紧急呼吁亚非新闻工作者
    支持香港新闻工作者和中国居民反英斗争
    新华社十四日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表声明，紧急呼吁亚非同行和争取解放的战士，支持香港新闻工作者兄弟和香港中国居民为反对港英当局的法西斯镇压和迫害而进行的斗争。
    声明说，这场残酷的斗争已进行了三个多月。斗争是从五月六日开始的，当时在英国当局直接控制下的香港警察袭击和镇压了九龙地区罢工的中国工人。自从那时起，斗争一直在发展，现在已成了广大香港中国居民群众反对英国法西斯当局的斗争。
    声明说，香港的中国工人、学生、新闻工作者和居民坚决反对英国当局的法西斯镇压和迫害，并强烈谴责美帝国主义强盗利用香港港口向英雄的越南人民进行大规模的侵略。
    英国帝国主义者保护他们自己和美国在亚洲、非洲的利益，十分害怕香港中国居民的坚强斗争，将把整个美英帝国主义统治淹没在革命斗争的熊熊烈火之中。他们特别害怕，香港这些大无畏的中国工人、学生和居民坚决以进行反帝斗争唯一正确的指导原则——光辉的毛泽东思想武装自己。
    声明指出，英国当局已逮捕了三千多名中国居民，非法对一千多人判刑，残酷地迫害他们，谋杀了许多人，开枪射击许多罢工工人，袭击民主群众团体，妄图把反对香港英帝国主义的革命火焰扑灭下去。英国法西斯当局发现镇压香港中国居民澎湃的斗争是无能为力了，现在他们正用配备有坦克、装甲车、催泪弹等的军队来对付人民。
    但是，世界上没有任何力量能吓倒起来提出正义要求的香港中国工人、学生、新闻工作者和居民。他们对英国压迫者展开针锋相对的斗争，规模日益扩大，进行严厉谴责、强烈抗议，并举行群众示威和工人的联合大罢工等等。他们已使英国经济处于瘫痪，严重打击了美帝对越南人民进行战争所作的种种努力。
    声明呼吁说，亚非同行们、兄弟们，亚非记协书记处认为香港的中国居民进行的英勇不屈的斗争，应得到我们全力的坚决的支持，因为他们的斗争是我们反帝斗争不可分割的一部分，他们的行动直接支持了他们兄弟的英雄的越南人民。
    声明指出，港英法西斯当局主要攻击目标之一是针对当地的新闻事业，在非法逮捕和监禁十四名新华社香港分社和爱国报纸记者之后，近来英帝国主义者又加紧对香港爱国新闻工作者进行反扑。八月九日，他们绑架了《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》、《香港商报》、南昌印务公司的五个负责人，并搜查了《新午报》社长的家。英国当局威胁要以“煽动”的罪名查封这些报纸和印务公司。
    声明说，这是港英当局法西斯暴行又一新的升级。英帝国主义者企图用这些手段来箝制中国报界，以使用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港居民的英勇斗争的消息不能在全世界传播，使英国当局的法西斯野蛮迫害不致在亚非人民面前被揭露。
    香港爱国新闻工作者已经表示，对于这一切野蛮的迫害，他们将同仇敌忾，坚决回击。
    声明说，亚非记协书记处号召亚非所有新闻工作者同行和为争取解放而斗争的战士，向香港的战斗中的兄弟给予同志般的支持和鼓励。
    英国当局对香港居民的法西斯镇压和迫害应该受到强烈的谴责。
    英国法西斯当局犯下的剥夺报道真理的权利的万恶不赦的罪责，应该受到严厉的谴责。
    所有被非法逮捕和监禁的中国新闻工作者、工人、学生及其他居民必须无条件地立即释放。
    英国当局对中国居民所造成的精神上和物质上的损失必须赔偿。
    香港中国居民的一切新闻、经济和政治活动，包括他们宣传毛泽东思想的正当权利，必须得到充分保证。
    声明说，让我们同香港革命人民联合起来并肩战斗到底，铲除美英帝国主义及其帮凶——以苏联统治集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动政权。
