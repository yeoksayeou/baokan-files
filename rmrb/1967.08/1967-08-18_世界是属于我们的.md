The world belongs to us.

In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shakes the world, the young Red Guards of China have ascended to the political stage with the heroic spirit of sweeping away all monsters and demons. A brilliant new thing has emerged on the eastern horizon of the world.

Since the birth of the Red Guards, a small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors has been madly cursing us as "acting recklessly" and "knowing nothing," and so on. For a year, the Soviet revisionist rumor mill has never stopped its vicious attacks and slanders against the Red Guards. It is precisely in the midst of the enemy's curses that we have grown stronger and stronger in battle.

In fact, it is the Soviet revisionist clique that has been trying every means to poison and corrupt the younger generation of the Soviet Union with bourgeois ideology. A university leader once openly told students, "Why bother with political issues? Go dancing! Go courting!" The *Komsomolskaya Pravda* even said, "Heroes like Paul Korchagin are outdated," using these "bloodless" methods to lead many Soviet youth down the path of degeneration. Today, in the Soviet Union, jazz, swing dancing, pornographic novels, and reactionary American films are all present, and the number of hoodlums and delinquents is increasing. Isn't this the real "acting recklessly"? The Soviet revisionist traitor clique uses bourgeois worldviews such as personal gain, promotion and wealth, hedonism, and the philosophy of survival to corrupt Soviet youth, making them forget what socialism and communism are, what the October Revolution and world revolution are. Isn't this the real "knowing nothing"?

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is well aware that to maintain and consolidate their capitalist restoration, to ensure that their revisionist rule has successors, they must make the younger generation forget about class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, forget about Leninism, and not rebel or revolutionize, but instead obediently accept bourgeois rule.

The Soviet revisionist clique attempts to turn the entire society into a bourgeois university, as Lenin pointed out sharply: "Every word in such a school is fabricated in the interests of the bourgeoisie.... The purpose of educating these youths is to train obedient slaves for the bourgeoisie, who can create profits for the master without disturbing the master's peace."

The Soviet revisionist clique has learned this from the imperialists, intending to make Lenin's hometown forever their paradise and destroy the third generation of the Soviet Union, which Lenin and Stalin had great hopes for.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao said ten years ago to Chinese students in the Soviet Union, "The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you."

It is also our great leader Chairman Mao who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, first discovered and actively supported the brilliant new thing, the Red Guards. As soon as the Red Guards appeared, they won the acclaim of the revolutionary people of the whole world with their completely new proletarian revolutionary spirit. They said with boundless enthusiasm, "The revolutionary masses of the whole world see not only the hope of China in the Red Guards but also the hope of the whole world."

"Dare to suffer a thousand cuts, dare to pull the emperor off his horse." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we raise high the banner of "Rebellion is justified" and launch a fierce attack on the bourgeoisie, on revisionism, on imperialism, and on the reactionaries of all countries. "Pointing at the rivers and mountains, stirring up words," we raise high the banner of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the banner of revolutionary criticism, expose and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and seize back all the power usurped by China's Khrushchev, firmly grasping it in the hands of the proletariat, ensuring that the socialist state remains unshakable for generations to come. This is us—the heroic Chinese Red Guards!

"Selflessly for the people," this is our noble spirit, the revolutionary sentiment we pursue. Forging a red world of Mao Zedong Thought, this is our highest ideal. To forever preserve our revolutionary youth, we have resolved to read Chairman Mao's books for life and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. This is us—the heroic Chinese Red Guards!

"We must sweep away all harmful creatures, leaving no enemies." Our hearts burn with a blazing anti-imperialist fire; our minds are stirred by the storms of world revolution. As long as the oppressed peoples and nations of the world are still suffering, as long as imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are still rampant and have not been destroyed, we will continue to fight on. To liberate all humanity and to realize the greatest ideal of humanity—communism, we will, together with the revolutionary people of the whole world, bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries with our own hands! This is us—the heroic Chinese Red Guards!

The imperialist soothsayers of the United States once placed their hopes of "peaceful evolution" on the third and fourth generations of China; Soviet modern revisionism sought to find sympathetic "healthy forces" in China. But it is precisely us—the heroic Chinese Red Guards—who have completely shattered the enemy's delusions!

Let a small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors jump with rage! The revolutionary tide is unstoppable. China's future is bright, and the Soviet Union's future is also bright. Although imperialism attempts to turn Soviet youth into a "lost generation" and a "silent generation," and the Soviet revisionist clique attempts to turn Soviet youth into docile tools and successors of their revisionist rule, the revolutionary youth of the Soviet Union will never be "lost," "silent," or "docile." They will surely rise up to rebel against revisionism, just like the Chinese Red Guards, and make the first socialist beacon lit by Lenin shine brightly again!

Heroic Chinese Red Guards, revolutionary youth of the Soviet Union, and all revolutionary youth of the world, the world belongs to us, and the brilliant future of communism belongs to us!

    世界是属于我们的
    上海复旦大学　红卫兵新复旦师
    “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”
    在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中，中国红卫兵小将以横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的英雄气概，杀上了政治舞台。一个光芒万丈的新生事物，出现在世界东方的地平线上。
    自从红卫兵诞生的那一天起，一小撮苏修叛徒就疯狂地咒骂我们是“胡作非为”、“一无所知”，等等。一年来，苏修的造谣机器从来没有停止过对红卫兵的恶毒攻击和诬蔑。我们正是在敌人的咒骂声中越战越强。
    其实，正是苏修集团千方百计地用资产阶级意识形态毒害和腐蚀苏联青年一代。有个大学领导人公开对学生说：“你们干嘛要管政治问题？跳舞去吧！谈情说爱去吧！”《共青团真理报》竟然说什么：“象保尔·柯察金这样的英雄早已过时了”，他们就是用这种“杀人不见血”的手段，使苏联许多青少年走上堕落的道路。今天，在苏联，爵士乐、摇摆舞、黄色小说、美国反动电影，应有尽有，社会上流氓阿飞越来越多，青少年犯罪现象层出不穷，这不是真正的“胡作非为”吗？苏修叛徒集团用资产阶级的世界观，诸如个人名利、升官发财、享乐主义、活命哲学来腐蚀苏联青年，使他们忘掉什么叫社会主义，共产主义，什么是十月革命，世界革命，这不是真正的“一无所知”吗？
    苏修统治集团深知：要把他们的资本主义复辟维持下去、巩固下去，要使他们推行的修正主义统治后继有人，就一定要使青年一代忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，忘掉列宁主义，不要造反，不要革命，服服贴贴接受资产阶级的统治。
    苏修集团企图把整个社会造成一个资产阶级大学校，正如列宁一针见血地指出的：“这种学校里的每一句话，都是根据资产阶级的利益捏造出来的。……教育这些青年的目的，就是要为资产阶级训练称心如意的奴仆，既能替主人创造利润，又不会惊扰主人的安宁。”
    苏修集团从帝国主义那里学来了这一套，无非是企图使列宁的故乡永远成为他们这些野心家的“乐园”，把列宁、斯大林寄予无限希望的苏联第三代毁掉。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席十年以前就在苏联对中国留学生语重心长地说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
    也正是我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命中，第一个发现并积极支持了光辉的新生事物红卫兵。红卫兵一出现，就以其崭新的无产阶级彻底革命的精神面貌，博得了全世界革命人民的欢呼。他们无限热情地说：“全世界革命群众从红卫兵身上不仅看到了中国的希望，也看到了全世界的希望。”
    “舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”。我们根据毛主席的教导，高举“造反有理”的大旗，大造资产阶级的反，大造修正主义的反，大造帝国主义和各国反动派的反。“指点江山，激扬文字”，我们高举伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜，高举革命的大批判的旗帜，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批臭，斗倒，打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，把中国的赫鲁晓夫篡夺的一切权力夺回来，牢牢掌握在无产阶级手中，使社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。这就是我们——英雄的中国红卫兵！
    “毫不利己专门利人”，这就是我们的高尚胸怀，我们所追求的革命情操。铸造一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界，这就是我们的最高理想。为永葆革命青春，我们下定决心读一辈子毛主席的书，永远做毛主席的好战士。这就是我们——英雄的中国红卫兵！
    “要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”我们的胸中，燃烧着熊熊的反帝烈火；我们的脑中，翻腾着世界革命的风云。只要世界上被压迫人民和被压迫民族还在受苦受难，只要帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派还在横行霸道，还没有被消灭，我们就要继续战斗下去。为解放全人类，为实现人类最伟大的理想——共产主义，我们就要同全世界革命人民一起，用自己的双手亲自埋葬帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派！这就是我们——英雄的中国红卫兵！
    美帝国主义预言家们曾经把“和平演变”的希望寄托在中国的第三代第四代身上；苏联现代修正主义企图从中国找到同情他们的“健康力量”。但是，正是我们——英雄的中国红卫兵，使敌人的这种痴心妄想彻底破产了！
    让一小撮苏修叛徒们暴跳如雷吧！革命的潮流永远不可阻挡。中国的前途是光明的，苏联的前途也是光明的。帝国主义虽然妄想把苏联青年变成“垮掉的一代”和“安静的一代”；苏修集团虽然妄想把苏联青年变成它的修正主义统治的驯服工具和接班人；但是，要革命的苏联青年是永远不会“垮掉”、“安静”和“驯服”的。他们一定会象中国的红卫兵一样，奋起造修正主义的反，使列宁亲手点燃的第一盏社会主义红灯重新大放光芒！
    英雄的中国红卫兵，苏联的革命青年们和全世界一切革命的青年们，世界是属于我们的，光辉灿烂的共产主义未来是属于我们的！
