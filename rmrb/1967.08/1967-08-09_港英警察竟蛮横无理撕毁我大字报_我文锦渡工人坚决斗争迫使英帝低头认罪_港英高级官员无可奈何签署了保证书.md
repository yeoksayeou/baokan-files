	Hong Kong British Police Shamelessly Tear Down Our Big Character Posters
	Our Workers at Man Kam To Struggle Resolutely and Force the British Imperialists to Admit Their Guilt
	High-ranking Hong Kong British Officials Have No Choice But to Sign a Guarantee

	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 7th — The porters at Man Kam To in Ba'an County, Guangdong Province, fought resolutely to protect and support the patriotic struggle of their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong and Kowloon against British imperialism. On the 5th, they engaged in a head-on struggle with British imperialism, defeated the provocations of the Hong Kong British authorities, and forced them to admit their guilt, greatly boosting their own morale and thoroughly crushing the enemy's arrogance.

	Man Kam To is a trade gateway between our side and Hong Kong and Kowloon. Our porters push carts daily to transport goods to the other side. The brutal fascist suppression of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon by the Hong Kong British authorities has sparked great indignation among the workers. On the afternoon of the 4th, the workers posted over forty slogans and big character posters, such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with British Imperialism!" around the cargo yard police station and the British customs area. After the workers finished their shift, a British police assistant, taking advantage of the darkness when people couldn't see, secretly led two policemen to tear down the big character posters put up by our workers. The British side's shameless and unreasonable behavior infuriated the workers.

	At around 8 AM on the 5th, twenty-seven porters, holding red flags and portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, marched in a column across the bridgehead to question the British police assistant about why he tore down the slogans and big character posters put up by our side. The British bandits fired three shots in an attempt to intimidate the workers who had come to reason with them. The British mercenaries and police on the scene also raised their guns to threaten the workers. The British police assistant even took a submachine gun from a policeman, ready to shoot at the workers. However, the Chinese workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, showed the greatest courage in the face of the beasts and did not show the slightest fear. With lightning speed, they snatched the gun from the British police assistant and a submachine gun from a British mercenary. The workers' brave actions startled the British police assistant, who was taken aback, and the mercenaries and police were also frightened and jumped around in confusion. Our workers immediately warned the Hong Kong British police and mercenaries not to move and ordered the British police assistant to admit his guilt for tearing down the big character posters and slogans put up by our workers. The British police assistant stubbornly denied his crimes, using the excuse of needing to "consult his superiors" to call in over a hundred British mercenaries. As soon as these mercenaries arrived, they surrounded the workers and lay down with their guns ready to shoot. The brave workers fearlessly stepped forward and angrily denounced the British police assistant. Seeing that this tactic did not intimidate the Chinese workers, a British police chief lied, saying that these mercenaries were just patrolling by and then shamefully withdrew them.

	The Hong Kong British authorities were at a loss, and some high-ranking officials had to take action personally. These British high-ranking officials first said that the "laws" of Hong Kong did not allow big character posters, and the workers immediately rebuked them, saying that the Chinese people do not recognize any Hong Kong British "laws." After being rebuked, they said that only ten posters were allowed. They then said that big character posters could only be posted in designated places. Our workers sternly warned them: The revolutionary actions of Chinese workers are not subject to any restrictions by the Hong Kong British authorities. We will post as many big character posters and slogans as we want and wherever we want. These high-ranking Hong Kong British officials finally had to admit their guilt and signed a guarantee, making three assurances to the workers: (1) They would guarantee the safekeeping of the big character posters in the future; (2) They would guarantee the safety of all workers at Man Kam To, including those from Hong Kong, as well as truck drivers working at Man Kam To; (3) They would guarantee the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought at Man Kam To, including the study of Hong Kong workers together with you, without any interference. If any of the above guarantees are violated in the future, the British authorities will be responsible for all consequences. Finally, the British side wrote the guarantee in both Chinese and English, read it aloud to the workers, and handed it over to our workers with both hands. The workers, holding high the red flags and singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," returned triumphantly to our side, greeted by the enthusiastic welcome of the local community.

	The Hong Kong British officials admitted their guilt to our workers and signed the guarantee, which is written in black and white and cannot be denied. In recent days, the radio and reactionary newspapers of the Hong Kong British authorities have distorted facts and spread lies, trying to cover up the true nature and embarrassment of the paper tiger. This is all in vain.

    港英警察竟蛮横无理撕毁我大字报
    我文锦渡工人坚决斗争迫使英帝低头认罪
    港英高级官员无可奈何签署了保证书
    新华社广州七日电  广东省保安县文锦渡搬运工人，为了保护支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的标语和大字报，五日同英帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，击败港英当局的挑衅，迫使它不得不低头认罪，大长了自己的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。
    文锦渡是我方通向港九的一个贸易出入口，我方搬运工人每天推车向对方运送货物。港英当局残酷镇压港九爱国同胞的法西斯暴行激起了工人们的极大愤慨。四日下午工人们把所写的“毛主席万岁！”“打倒英帝！”等四十多张标语和大字报贴到货场警署以及英方海关周围。工人下班以后，英方一警察帮办趁天黑人们看不见时，竟带领两名警察偷偷地把我工人贴的大字报撕掉。英方这种蛮横无理的行为引起工人的极大愤怒。
    五日上午八时许，二十七名搬运工人高举红旗和伟大领袖毛主席画像，列队走过桥头，质问英国警察帮办为什么撕掉我方贴的标语和大字报。英国强盗竟连开三枪妄图恫吓前往说理的工人群众，在场的英国雇佣军和警察也一齐举枪向工人进行恫吓，英国警察帮办也从警察手里拿过一支冲锋枪准备向工人射击。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人，具有最大的勇敢，他们在野兽面前没有表示丝毫的怯懦，他们以迅雷不及掩耳的快速动作，夺过英国警察帮办的枪和英国雇佣军的一支手提冲锋枪。工人们的英勇行动吓得英国警察帮办慌了手脚，雇佣军和警察也被吓得乱跳乱窜。我方工人当即严正警告港英警察和雇佣军不得乱动，并责令英国警察帮办对撕毁我方工人贴的大字报和标语一事低头认罪。英国警察帮办对自己的罪行百般狡赖，借要“请示上级”之名，叫来一百多名英国雇佣军。这些雇佣军一到，就把工人包围起来，并端枪卧倒，准备射击。勇敢的工人们毫不畏惧地挺身向前，愤怒斥责英国警察帮办。英国警察的一个头头看到这种做法吓不倒中国工人，只好撒谎说这些雇佣军是巡逻经过这里的，并灰溜溜地撤走了这些雇佣军。
    港英当局无计可施，一些高级官员只好亲自出马。这些英国高级官员一会儿说港英的“法律”不准贴大字报，工人们当即斥责说，中国人民根本不承认什么港英“法律”。他们遭到斥责后又说什么只许贴十张。他们一会儿又说什么大字报只能贴在指定的地方。我方工人严正地警告他们：中国工人的革命行动不受港英当局的任何限制，大字报和标语我们要贴多少就贴多少，要贴在那里就贴在那里。这些港英高级官员最后不得不低头认罪，并签署了保证书，向工人作了三项保证：（一）保证今后代你们保管大字报；（二）保证在文锦渡全体工作人员包括香港来的工人，汽车司机等在文锦渡工作的人身安全；（三）保证在文锦渡宣传毛主席思想包括香港来的工人与你们一起学习不受任何干涉。如果以后违犯上列各项保证，一切后果由英国当局承担。最后，英方把保证书写成中文英文各一份，向工人群众朗读，并双手交给我方工人。工人群众高举红旗，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》胜利地回到我方境内，受到当地社员群众的热烈欢迎。
    港英官员向我工人低头认罪，签署了保证书，黑字写在白纸上，想赖也赖不掉。最近几天，港英当局的电台和反动报纸颠倒是非，歪曲事实真相，港英帝国主义大肆造谣，妄图掩饰纸老虎的本质和狼狈相，这完全是徒劳的。
