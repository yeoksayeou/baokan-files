	Beijing Holds Conference on Revolution and Production for Industrial and Transportation Sectors
	Calls on All Workers in the City to Take Revolutionary Criticism as the Guideline, Achieve Revolutionary Unity, Revolutionary "Three-in-One" Combination, and Unit-level Struggle, Criticism, and Reform, Strive for Excellence, and Strive to Complete the Second Half of the Year's Production and Construction Tasks Efficiently and Effectively

	Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison recently convened a conference on revolution and production with over a hundred key factories, mines, and enterprises, as well as representatives from the People's Liberation Army supporting industry. The conference called on all revolutionary workers in the city to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to take revolutionary criticism as the guideline, to achieve revolutionary unity, revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and unit-level struggle, criticism, and reform, to use revolution as the driving force, to strive for excellence, and to complete the second half of the year's production and construction tasks efficiently and effectively.

	The attendees first analyzed the current good situation in Beijing's industrial and transportation sectors. They pointed out: Under the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the situation in the city's industrial and transportation sectors is unprecedentedly good and continues to improve. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a new high, the revolutionary criticism movement is surging forward, and revolutionary unity is advancing. Driven by the revolution, the total industrial output value and the production of major products in the first half of the year have both increased compared to the same period last year. This good situation is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	The proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital's industrial and transportation sectors, after achieving victory in the struggle to seize power from the capitalist-roaders within the party, have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policies of "revolution and production" and "revolution through economy," shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, and achieving great successes and gaining rich experience. At the meeting, Beijing Wood Factory, Beijing Radio Factory, Beijing Paper Mill, Jingxi Coal Mine, Beijing Wire Factory, Beijing Coking Plant, Beijing Third General Machinery Factory, Beijing Gas Appliance Machinery Factory, Beijing Public Transportation Company, and Beijing Transportation Company, among others, shared their experiences in revolution and production. Their experiences show that after taking power, the proletarian revolutionary factions must first focus on revolution to promote production. Their experiences also show that in the revolutionary criticism, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving revolutionary unity is a crucial key to doing all work well.

	Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Wu De, and Committee Member Zhou Jingfang, among others, attended the meeting to express their greetings to the revolutionary workers fighting on the front lines of revolution and production, and to express their thanks to the People's Liberation Army for their new achievements in the "three supports, two militaries" work. In their speeches, they pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is the weapon of revolutionary criticism and the soul of revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. Revolutionary criticism is the guideline for all work, and revolutionary unity is the key to completing all tasks. By doing well in criticism, unity, three-in-one combination, and struggle, criticism, and reform, we can focus on revolution and promote production.

	Huang Zuojin, the second political commissar of the Beijing Garrison, also spoke at the meeting. He said: The People's Liberation Army should help the revolutionary leftists more resolutely and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correct the shortcomings in the advance, and also help the masses who were deceived and joined conservative organizations to turn around from their fundamental stance, admit their mistakes, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, uniting against the enemy.

	At the meeting, Gao Yangwen, a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, made a concluding speech, outlining the requirements for the work of the capital's industrial and transportation sectors in the second half of the year. In his concluding speech, he pointed out that the revolutionary workers in the capital should recognize the current good situation in revolution and production, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and launch a "people's war" to thoroughly defeat the "fallen dogs," conducting a thorough criticism and struggle against the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and their backers. Through revolutionary criticism, promote revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and combine it with the unit-level struggle, criticism, and reform to thoroughly eliminate the poison they spread in the enterprises. According to Chairman Mao's May 7th instructions, turn the factories into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought. Gao Yangwen, in his speech, required revolutionary workers to be models of supporting the army, under the help of the People's Liberation Army, to focus on revolution, vigorously promote production, and complete the second half of the year's production and construction tasks efficiently and effectively. Each factory, mine, and enterprise should handle the relationship between revolution and production, use revolution to drive production, establish and improve a revolutionary production team, establish a new production order, consolidate labor discipline, overcome anarchism, and be vigilant against enemy sabotage. The revolutionary workers in each factory, mine, and enterprise should actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, economize to make revolution, run enterprises thriftily, and launch a mass movement of economy.

    新华社三日讯　北京市革命委员会和北京卫戍区最近召集一百多个重点厂矿企业的生产班子负责人和支援工业的人民解放军代表，举行抓革命、促生产会议。会议号召全市广大革命职工更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以革命的大批判为纲，搞好革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”和本单位的斗批改，以革命为动力，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地完成下半年的生产和建设任务。
    到会的同志，首先分析了当前北京工交战线上革命和生产的大好形势。他们指出：在北京市革命委员会的正确领导下，在人民解放军大力支援下，全市工交战线的形势空前大好，而且越来越好。活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的高潮，革命的大批判运动一浪高过一浪，革命的大联合正在向前发展。在革命的带动之下，上半年工业总产值和主要产品产量都比去年同期有提高。这一片大好形势，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    首都工交战线上的无产阶级革命派，在取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争胜利以后，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针，挑起了革命和生产两副重担，取得了很大成绩，获得了丰富的经验。会上，北京木材厂、北京无线电厂、北京造纸总厂、京西长沟峪煤矿、北京钢丝厂、北京焦化厂、北京市第三通用机械厂、北京市煤气用具机械厂、北京市人民汽车公司、北京市运输公司等单位，分别介绍了他们抓革命、促生产的经验。他们的经验表明，无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，只有首先抓好革命，才能促进生产。他们的经验还表明，在革命的大批判中，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，实现革命的大联合，这是搞好各项工作的重要关键。
    北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德、常委周景方等同志到会向奋战在革命和生产第一线的革命职工表示慰问，向在“三支”“两军”工作中立下新功的解放军表示感谢。他们在讲话中指出：毛泽东思想是革命大批判的武器，是革命大联合和革命“三结合”的灵魂，我们一定要在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作。革命的大批判，是一切工作的纲，革命的大联合，是完成各项工作的关键。搞好大批判、大联合、三结合、斗批改，就能抓好革命，促进生产。
    北京卫戍区第二政委黄作珍同志也在会上讲了话。他说：人民解放军要帮助革命左派更坚决、更彻底地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，改正前进中的缺点；也要帮助受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众从根本立场上转过来，承认错误，回到毛主席的革命路线一边来，团结对敌。
    会上，北京市革命委员会常委高扬文同志作了总结发言，对今年下半年首都工交战线的工作提出了要求。他在总结发言中指出，首都广大革命职工要认清当前革命和生产的大好形势，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展痛打“落水狗”的“人民战争”，对彭真反革命修正主义集团及其总后台进行大批判、大斗争，通过革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，并且和本单位的斗批改结合起来，彻底清除他们在企业中散布的流毒，按照毛主席“五·七”指示，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。高扬文在发言中要求革命职工做拥军的模范，在人民解放军帮助下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，多快好省地完成下半年生产建设任务。各厂矿企业要处理好革命和生产的关系，以革命带动生产，建立和健全革命化的生产班子，建立生产的新秩序，巩固劳动纪律，克服无政府主义，警惕敌人的破坏。各厂矿企业革命职工要积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，节约闹革命，勤俭办企业，发动群众开展一个节约运动。
