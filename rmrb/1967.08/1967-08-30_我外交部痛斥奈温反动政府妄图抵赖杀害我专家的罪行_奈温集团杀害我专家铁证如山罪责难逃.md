The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on August 28 handed a note to the Burmese Embassy in China, strongly condemning the Ne Win reactionary government for attempting to evade and cover up the bloody crime of killing Chinese expert Liu Yi.

In a note dated August 16, the Burmese side hypocritically stated: "The Union Government of Burma has expressed deep regret over the death of Mr. Liu Yi and has taken responsibility for providing compensation to his family."

The note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that after plotting and carrying out large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities, brutally attacking the Chinese Embassy, and killing Chinese experts in a series of fascist atrocities, the Ne Win reactionary government has been arrogant and deceitful, refusing to respond to the five serious demands of the Chinese government. Now, it is once again playing a despicable trick, attempting to turn the serious political event of killing Chinese expert Liu Yi into an isolated, accidental legal case, claiming to provide compensation according to Burmese regulations, and so on.

The note said, you think you can easily say "regret" and give some money to cover up the heinous bloody crimes you have committed. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

The note pointed out that the Ne Win reactionary government is the mastermind behind the nationwide anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Burma, and the Ne Win clique is the behind-the-scenes planner and instigator of the killing of Chinese expert Liu Yi and the sabotage of the Sino-Burmese economic and technological cooperation agreement. You have blood on your hands, and the evidence is irrefutable. Attempting to escape responsibility in this way, deceiving the Burmese people and the just public opinion of the world, is absolutely impossible. The five serious demands of the Chinese government must be fully complied with, not a single item can be omitted.

The note said that the Chinese government also warns the Ne Win reactionary government that you have destroyed the relations between the two countries to such a serious extent, and yet you still talk about "traditional friendship between the two countries," which is truly shameful! Pretending to be virtuous in this way can only further expose your guilty conscience in front of the Burmese people and all the people of the world.

    我外交部痛斥奈温反动政府妄图抵赖杀害我专家的罪行
    奈温集团杀害我专家铁证如山罪责难逃
    新华社二十九日讯　中国外交部二十八日交给缅甸驻华大使馆一份照会，痛斥奈温反动政府妄图抵赖和掩盖杀害中国专家刘逸的血腥罪行。
    缅方在八月十六日的一份来照中装模作样地说：“缅甸联邦政府已就刘逸先生之死表示了深切的遗憾，并已承担对他的家属给予抚恤。”
    中国外交部的照会说，奈温反动政府在策划和制造了大规模反华排华事件、野蛮袭击中国大使馆、杀害中国专家等一系列法西斯暴行后，一直蛮横狡赖，拒不答复中国政府的五项严正要求，现在又一次玩弄卑劣的手法，阴谋把杀害中国专家刘逸这一严重的政治事件，当作一个孤立的、偶然的司法案件来处理，说什么要根据缅甸的有关规定，给予多少抚恤金，等等。
    照会说，你们指望这样轻巧地说一声“遗憾”，给几个钱，来掩盖你们所犯下的骇人听闻的血腥罪行。这是中国政府和中国人民绝对不能答应的。
    照会指出，奈温反动政府就是这次在缅甸全国范围内疯狂反华排华的罪魁祸首，奈温集团一伙就是杀害中国专家刘逸、破坏中缅经济技术合作协定的幕后策划者和主使者。你们血债累累，铁证如山，企图用这种办法来逃避罪责，欺骗缅甸人民和世界公正舆论，是绝对办不到的。中国政府的五项严正要求，你们必须一一照办，少一项也不行。
    照会说，中国政府还要正告奈温反动政府，你们把两国关系破坏到如此严重的地步，来照还侈谈什么“两国传统友谊”，实在可耻！假惺惺地摆出这副伪善姿态，只能在缅甸人民和全世界人民面前，进一步暴露你们作贼心虚的丑恶嘴脸。
