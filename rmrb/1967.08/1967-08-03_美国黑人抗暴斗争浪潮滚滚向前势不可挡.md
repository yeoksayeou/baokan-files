The wave of black people's struggle against violence in the United States, which has been ongoing for three weeks without interruption, continues to roll forward. The increasing number of black people taking up arms in their struggle has made the U.S. ruling class anxious and uneasy. Some legislators helplessly admit that there is "no prospect of an immediate solution" to this situation. They have never been as "panicked" about the future of the United States as they are now.

Following Newark and Detroit, black people in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, have once again demonstrated the heroic spirit of the awakening black masses in the United States in their struggle against violence. According to reports, the black people in this city have been armed and bravely resisting thousands of fully armed military police since July 30. Their resistance grows stronger each day, and by the morning of August 2, the military police were in a state of emergency, requesting "heavy automatic weapons."

The reactionary authorities in Milwaukee, who were terrified by the large-scale armed struggle of black people in Detroit, took "special measures" from the outset to suppress the black people's struggle in this city: they declared a curfew day and night, cut off all internal and external communications, and deployed thousands of military police equipped with armored vehicles to surround the black neighborhoods and patrol the entire city. Over four days, the military police have injured about a hundred black people and arrested six hundred. However, the black masses, especially the black youth, are fearless. Despite the curfew, they still gather in hundreds to throw stones and bricks at the military police or use various cover to snipe. By midnight on August 1, the sound of sniper fire became denser, and the number of fires caused by black people's homemade Molotov cocktails reached over two hundred and fifty. According to reports, due to the curfew day and night, this largest city in the state is currently in a state of paralysis.

In the large city of Providence in the northeastern United States, black people have exchanged fire with the police for two consecutive nights, injuring six police officers, and the gunshots continued until this morning. The governor of this state hurriedly cut short his vacation to the scene to personally plan the suppression. By the morning of August 2, more than a hundred National Guards had been sent, and the remaining more than two thousand National Guards were ordered to "stand by."

On August 2, new black people's struggles against violence broke out in cities near New York, such as Yonkers, and in Chicago and Peoria in Illinois. Like many other cities, black people in Yonkers and Peoria also used guns and homemade Molotov cocktails to fight against the police who were committing violence. Before this, black people in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Denver, Colorado, conducted armed struggles against violence on July 30 and 31, burning police cars with homemade Molotov cocktails and engaging in gunfights with the police.

The black people's struggle in Washington, D.C., has been brutally suppressed by the reactionary authorities; but Western news agencies anxiously point out that there is a "danger" of a new, larger-scale black people's struggle against violence brewing there.

    美国黑人抗暴斗争浪潮滚滚向前势不可挡
    继纽瓦克底特律后密尔沃基市黑人抗暴斗争使该市陷于瘫痪状态
    越来越多黑人拿起武器进行斗争使美国统治集团感到恐慌和不安
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：三个星期来一直没有间断的美国黑人抗暴斗争浪潮，正继续滚滚向前。越来越多的美国黑人拿起武器进行斗争的行动，使美国统治集团惶惶不安。一些议员无可奈何地承认：这种局势“没有迅即得到解决的前景”。他们对于美国的“前途”从来没有象现在这样“感到恐慌”。
    继纽瓦克、底特律之后，威斯康星州密尔沃基市的黑人在抗暴斗争中，再次表现了正在觉醒中的美国广大黑人不畏强暴的英雄气概。据报道，这个城市的黑人从七月三十日开始，连日来一直在手执武器，顽强地抗击几千名全副武装的军警，而且愈战愈勇，到二日早晨，军警纷纷告急，要求发给“重型自动武器”。
    被底特律的黑人大规模武装抗暴斗争吓破了胆的密尔沃基市反动当局，从一开始就对这个城市的黑人斗争采取了“特别措施”进行镇压：宣布日夜戒严，断绝市内和对外的一切交通联系，派出配备装甲车辆的六七千名军警包围黑人区和在全市巡逻。四天来，军警已经打伤了约一百名黑人，逮捕了六百人。但是，黑人群众，特别是黑人青少年，毫不畏惧，他们不顾戒严令，照样成百人地聚集在一起用石块砖头打击军警，或者利用各种掩体进行狙击。到一日午夜，狙击枪声越来越密，黑人自制燃烧瓶引起的火灾已达二百五十多起。据报道，由于全市昼夜戒严，这个全州最大的城市目前已经陷于瘫痪状态。
    在美国东北部的大城市罗得岛州的普罗维顿斯，黑人连续两晚同警察交火，打伤了六名警察，直到今天清晨，枪声不绝。这个州的州长匆忙中断休假赶到现场亲自策划镇压。二日清晨已经派去一百多名国民警卫队，其余两千多名国民警卫队奉命“戒备”。
    二日，在纽约近郊的韦安坦奇，伊利诺斯州的芝加哥及皮奥里亚等城市，还爆发了新的黑人抗暴斗争。同其他许多城市一样，韦安坦奇和皮奥里亚的黑人在斗争中也使用了枪支和自制燃烧瓶打击行凶作恶的警察。在这以前，佛罗里达州的西棕榈海滩和科罗拉多州的丹佛市的黑人在七月三十、三十一日接连进行武装抗暴斗争，他们用自制燃烧瓶烧毁警车，并同警察展开枪战。
    华盛顿的黑人斗争，遭到反动当局残暴镇压；但西方通讯社不安地指出，那里正面临可能爆发新的黑人抗暴斗争的“危险”，而且规模可能更大。
