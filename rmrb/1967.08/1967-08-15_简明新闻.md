Vice Chairman Ding Xilin of the China-Africa Friendship Association and Congolese (Brazzaville) Ambassador to China Bazanga both spoke at the tea party.

Ambassador Bazanga, along with the revolutionary masses attending the tea party, shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the friendship between the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and the Chinese people!" "Long live the people of Asia and Africa!"

The tea party screened the color documentary "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line - Celebrating International Labor Day."

The Red Cross Society of China donated 50,000 yuan to the Red Cross Society of Pakistan to aid the victims of the floods in Karachi.

On the 12th, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Xu Ying, handed over the donation to the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was then forwarded to the Pakistani Red Cross Society.

The Red Cross Society of China also sent a telegram to the Pakistani Red Cross Society expressing sympathy for the victims in Karachi.

From July 24th to 26th, Karachi experienced continuous heavy rainfall, causing rivers in the suburbs to surge and resulting in disasters, with some residents left homeless.

The military and people of the northern provinces of Vietnam, such as Lang Son and Nghe An, shot down one U.S. aggressor aircraft each on the 13th.

According to supplementary reports, the military and people of Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Thanh Hoa provinces shot down a total of eight U.S. aggressor aircraft on the 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 12th.

The artillery units of the Vietnam People's Army wounded one U.S. warship that had intruded into the waters off Thanh Hoa Province on the 9th.

Approximately 9,000 people from various sectors in Australia took to the streets of Sydney on the 13th to protest against Australia's participation in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

The demonstrators marched to a stadium where a rally was held. Speakers at the rally emphasized that protests against the U.S. war in Vietnam would continue until Australia withdrew its troops from South Vietnam.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) publication "Independence" recently published an article calling on Congolese (Brazzaville) writers and artists to wage a long-term and unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialist cultural aggression, as well as against new and old colonialism and other reactionary and decadent cultures, literatures, and arts, and to eradicate their poisonous influences.

The article was published to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the August Revolution (August 15) in Congo (Brazzaville).

The Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the 12th, calling on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, occupied by Israel, to continue their anti-aggression struggle and strive for the liberation of their homeland.

The statement exposed the imperialist and Zionist plot to force Palestinians from the occupied territories to move to the east bank of the Jordan River and resettle in other countries. The statement said that the purpose of this plot is to undermine their resolute resistance to Israeli aggression.

More and more Laotian pseudo-military personnel are dissatisfied with the reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and are defecting. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 827 pseudo-military personnel deserted in the first seven months of this year, with 363 deserting in July alone.

The report said that these deserters, in addition to a portion returning to their hometowns to engage in production, have many who have surrendered to the patriotic armed forces. In July alone, 133 people surrendered.
