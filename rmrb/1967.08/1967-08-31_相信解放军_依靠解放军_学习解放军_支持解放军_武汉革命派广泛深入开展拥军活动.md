The proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region have responded most resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a new high tide of "supporting the military." They say, the People's Liberation Army is the most organized revolutionary rebel faction created and led by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. We have full confidence in them. We must hold high the banner of "supporting the military," stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the PLA, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

When the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the Wuhan region created a serious political incident, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers stationed in Wuhan stood up, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, defending the proletarian headquarters, and defending the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary fighters. These heroic deeds, sung and remembered by the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people, have shown that without the support of the PLA, there would be no victory for the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Therefore, supporting or not supporting the PLA is a major issue of supporting or not supporting the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

The "Three Steels," "Three News," and "Three Revolutionary Committees" revolutionary organizations jointly formulated measures for "supporting the military." Each headquarters has successively established "supporting the military" offices, and some organizations have even published "supporting the military" bulletins, reporting good deeds of "supporting the military and loving the people." Many grassroots organizations have invited units that have performed meritorious deeds in the struggle to defend the proletarian headquarters to give reports or hold discussions. After listening to the reports, the revolutionary youngsters, filled with great emotion, pinned Mao badges on the "most beloved people" and put their own armbands on the arms of the "most beloved people."

"Supporting the military means learning from the military." In recent times, many revolutionary mass organizations have, according to their specific situations, adopted different methods to learn from the PLA.

With the emergence of a good situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region, some people within the revolutionary factions thought, "Victory has been achieved, everything is fine!" In response to this trend, the responsible comrades of relevant revolutionary mass organizations organized everyone to learn from the PLA's spirit of thorough revolution. They invited the PLA to tell battle stories, introduce the history of their units, and study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" together with the PLA. Through these activities, the awareness of the revolutionary masses has been raised, and they have decided to launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and denouncing Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan politically, ideologically, and theoretically. The revolutionary youngsters of "Steel Second Committee," "Three Revolutionary Committees" in Red Water Hospital, New Wuhan University, New Lake Hospital, and New People's Hospital, with the help of the PLA stationed on campus, gradually organized themselves and joined the torrent of revolutionary criticism.

Learning to seriously implement the Party's policies in the same way as the PLA is also an important part of learning from the PLA in the Wuhan region. Some soldiers in the "Steel Workers' General" branch of the Wuhan Shipyard did not fully understand the significance of doing work among the deceived masses and were not willing to do painstaking and detailed political and ideological work. Through learning from the PLA stationed in the factory, they gradually understood the truth that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party" and adopted forms such as big-character posters, discussions, and visits to help many deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, contributing to the "grasp revolution, promote production."

The proletarian revolutionary factions of "Three Steels," "Three News," and "Three Revolutionary Committees" all regard helping the PLA to better complete the "three supports, two militaries" work as a major political task of "supporting the military." They organized many report teams and propaganda teams to introduce to the PLA the situation of the class struggle, the struggle between two roads, and the struggle between two lines in the country, especially in Wuhan, exposing and denouncing the brutal persecution of the proletarian revolutionary factions by the bourgeois reactionary line. They also frequently held discussions with the PLA stationed in their units, exchanging views with each other. Some units even assisted the PLA in establishing cultural revolution document reading rooms for the soldiers. The PLA cadres and soldiers were deeply moved and said, this is the most vivid and realistic class education course, which is of great help to us in doing the "three supports, two militaries" work well.

The broad proletarian revolutionary factions have unlimited concern for the children of the people. They saw that the PLA's living quarters were crowded, so they vacated their own rooms; they saw that the PLA had no place to take a bath, so they hurriedly built bathhouses; they heard that the PLA was going out on missions, so they secretly filled the PLA's water bottles; they saw the PLA standing guard and keeping watch in 40-degree high temperatures, so they rushed to send them tea and water. These activities of supporting the military show that the proletarian revolutionary factions are using the red thread of Mao Zedong Thought to tie their hearts even more closely to the PLA.

    相信解放军　依靠解放军　学习解放军　支持解放军
    武汉革命派广泛深入开展拥军活动
    本报讯　武汉地区无产阶级革命派，最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了“拥军”的新高潮。他们说，人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席亲自指挥的最有组织的革命造反派，我们就是信得过。我们一定要把“拥军”的大旗举得高高的，和解放军肩并肩，心连心，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    当中国赫鲁晓夫在武汉地区的代理人制造严重的政治事件时，驻武汉地区广大指战员挺身而出，保卫了毛主席的革命路线，保卫了无产阶级司令部，保卫了广大的无产阶级革命派战士。这些可歌可泣的英勇事迹，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众看在眼里，记在心上。他们说，没有解放军的支援，就没有武汉地区文化大革命的胜利。因此，拥护不拥护解放军，是拥护不拥护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的大事。
    “三钢”“三新”“三司革联”等革命组织，共同制定了“拥军”措施。各总部都相继成立了“拥军”办公室，有些组织还出了“拥军”小报，登载“拥军爱民”的好人好事。许多基层组织，都邀请在保卫无产阶级司令部斗争中立功的部队，作报告或一起座谈。革命小将听了报告后，怀着十分激动的感情，把毛主席像章，别在“最可爱的人”的胸前；把自己的袖章，戴在“最可爱的人”的臂上。
      “拥军就要学军”。最近一个时期里，许多革命群众组织，都根据自己的具体情况，采取不同方法，向解放军学习。
    随着武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的出现，革命派内部有些人认为“胜利了，万事大吉了！”针对这个苗头，有关革命群众组织的负责人，就组织大家学习解放军的彻底革命精神。他们请解放军讲战斗故事，介绍连队史，和解放军一起学习毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》。通过这些活动，革命群众的觉悟有了提高，决心掀起革命大批判的高潮，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭。红水院、新武大、新湖医、新民院的“钢二司”、“三司革联”的革命小将，在驻校解放军的帮助下，逐步组织起来，投入革命大批判的洪流。
    象解放军那样认真贯彻党的政策，也是武汉地区学习解放军的重要内容。“钢工总”武昌造船厂分团的有些战士，对做受蒙蔽群众工作的意义认识不足，不愿做艰苦细致的政治思想工作。他们在向驻厂解放军学习的过程中，逐步懂得了“政策和策略是党的生命”的道理，采取了大批判、座谈、访问等形式，帮助不少受蒙蔽群众回到了毛主席的革命路线上来，对“抓革命，促生产”作出了贡献。
    “三钢”“三新”“三司革联”等无产阶级革命派，都把帮助解放军更好地完成“三支”“两军”的工作，当作“拥军”的重大政治任务。他们组织了许多汇报团、宣传队，向解放军介绍了全国特别是武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况，揭发和控诉了资产阶级反动路线对无产阶级革命派的残酷迫害。他们还经常和驻本单位的解放军座谈，相互交换意见。有的单位还协助解放军建立了文化革命资料阅览室，供战士学习。解放军干部和战士十分感动地说，这是最生动、最现实的阶级教育课，对我们做好“三支”“两军”工作有很大的帮助。
    广大无产阶级革命派无限关怀人民的子弟兵。他们看到解放军住的地方拥挤，就把自己的房子腾出来；他们看到解放军没有地方洗澡，就动手赶建洗澡棚；他们听到解放军外出执行任务时，就悄悄地把解放军的水壶灌满；他们看到解放军在四十度的高温下站岗、放哨，就争着送茶送水。这些拥军的活动表明，无产阶级革命派，正用毛泽东思想的红线，把自己的心和解放军更紧密地连在一起了。（附图片）
