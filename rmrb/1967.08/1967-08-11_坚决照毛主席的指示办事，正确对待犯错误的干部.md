Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must unite with the majority and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is frantically implementing the policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few." This is a fundamental contradiction in the line of struggle over cadre issues. After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has been fully proven that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is extremely wise and correct. The majority of our cadres are good or relatively good, and those who are taking the capitalist road are only a handful. However, some cadres, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line implemented by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, and because they have not sufficiently transformed their worldview by studying Chairman Mao's works, have made mistakes of varying degrees. How to handle these cadres who have made mistakes is the key issue in the struggle over cadre issues. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are spreading the anarchist slogan of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," using every means to deceive and mislead the masses, striking at cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, in an attempt to confuse the class lines and achieve their goal of protecting themselves. We proletarian revolutionaries resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and firmly resist and criticize the capitalist reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in cadre issues, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and for cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, we adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," using the method of "unity-criticism-unity." On the one hand, we seriously criticize their mistakes, and on the other hand, we enthusiastically support and help them stand up and join the proletarian revolutionaries to thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Air Force leadership who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly criticize the "private" in our minds, thereby achieving the goal of "uniting the majority and striking at the handful," and making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Air Force leadership organs advance victoriously.

Strike at the handful, promote the liberation of cadres who have made mistakes

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." This means to unite with the majority and strike at the handful, and "uniting with the majority" and "striking at the handful" are two aspects of a contradictory unity. Only by striking at the handful can we unite with the majority; only by uniting with the majority can we more thoroughly and accurately strike at the handful. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, regardless of how much interference and impact there is, from the beginning of the movement to now, we have always directed the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasping it to the end, fighting it to the end, and effectively promoting the liberation of cadres who have made mistakes, quickly and well uniting with the majority of cadres.

Striking at the handful can best test cadres and distinguish which command they belong to. Whether a cadre is revolutionary or not, mainly depends on whether they support Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and whether they oppose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their capitalist reactionary line. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, their methods are very covert, deceiving some cadres to follow them, making the class lines unclear. We strike at the handful, which can most effectively distinguish between friends and enemies. All cadres who belong to the proletarian command will certainly hate the handful, actively expose and mercilessly struggle against the handful; all those who belong to the bourgeois black command will certainly do everything they can to protect the handful, do everything they can to help them pass unnoticed; some cadres who are temporarily deceived and do not yet understand will gradually distinguish between friends and enemies in the struggle and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the proletarian revolutionaries.

Striking at the handful can best educate cadres, especially cadres who have made mistakes, to quickly raise their consciousness. Some cadres who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, the poisoning of "Cultivation," and the fact that their bourgeois worldview has not been thoroughly transformed, they were not conscious at the beginning of the movement, they protected those who were taking the capitalist road, and some even strongly opposed us. If we did not strike at the handful but directed the struggle at these cadres who had made mistakes, we would fall into the trap of the capitalist reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few." We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings that good people are in the majority and bad people are in the minority, concentrating our firepower to strike at the handful, as a result, the deceived cadres woke up one after another, and as the struggle deepened, they all stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, turning their guns on the handful.

Striking at the handful provides the best opportunity for cadres who have made mistakes to "come out" and make a comeback. Our liberation of cadres is not from a benevolent point of view, but in the struggle, helping cadres to liberate themselves. Striking at the handful can well play the role of helping cadres to liberate themselves. Many cadres who have made mistakes, because they had more contact with those who were taking the capitalist road in the past and knew more about the situation, as their consciousness was raised in the struggle, they exposed the inside stories that others could not easily know, and some gradually became powerful "shooters" and "bombers" in the struggle against the handful, and they also gradually gained the trust of the masses.

Our practical experience proves: the units that grasp and strike at the handful tightly and fiercely are the units where cadres who have made mistakes come out quickly, and the work of uniting with the majority is done well.

Put the public first, dare to unite with and liberate cadres who have made mistakes

For cadres who have made mistakes, after being tempered and tested in the process of striking at the handful, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings to unite with all those who can be united, and follow the instructions in the "Sixteen Points" to "ultimately unite with more than 95% of the cadres after the movement," daring to boldly unite with them, daring to boldly liberate them.

The contradictions between cadres who have made mistakes and us are internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, our attitude towards cadres who have made mistakes should be both serious and enthusiastic, and the methods we use for them are both burning and protecting. We protect their mainstream of supporting Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and burn their shortcomings, mistakes, and the poison of the capitalist reactionary line in their minds. We mercilessly expose and criticize their shortcomings and mistakes, but we do not completely negate them or overthrow them, but rather we help them recognize and rectify their mistakes in a realistic and benevolent way, uniting with them to fight against the enemy.

Whether to dare to unite with and liberate cadres who have made mistakes, and enthusiastically help them stand up, the key is to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, doing everything for the public good.

"The attitude towards cadres who have made mistakes, 'left' is better than 'right.' 'Left' is a matter of understanding, 'right' is a matter of stance. Understanding is not a big problem, but stance is a serious matter." This idea of preferring "left" to "right" is a major obstacle to uniting with the majority of cadres. This is the poison of the capitalist reactionary line. In essence, both "left" and "right" are against Mao Zedong Thought, both are harmful to the revolutionary cause. Preferring "left" to "right" is actually "left" in form but "right" in essence. Adopting this "left" wrong policy will result in striking down a large number, committing the error that Chairman Mao criticized as "driving fish into the deep and birds into the woods," driving "ten thousand" and "vast numbers" to the enemy's side, only to gain the enemy's applause, ultimately strengthening the enemy, isolating oneself, and finally protecting the handful. This idea of preferring "left" to "right" is not considering issues from Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary interests, but from personal interests of whether one makes mistakes or not. Starting from selfishness to rebel will only make the rebellion more "rebellious."

In the struggle, mixing personal grudges, gains and losses, and emotions, using these to decide whether to unite with or liberate a certain cadre, is another obstacle to uniting with the majority of cadres. There are such leading cadres who are good in major principles, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and walk the socialist road, but have serious shortcomings and mistakes in minor principles, such as simple work methods and harsh attitudes towards subordinates, etc., and the masses have greater resentment towards this aspect. Some comrades hold onto such cadres and do not let them pass after multiple inspections. We organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings of "everything from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups," and for such leading cadres, we do not calculate personal grudges, do not care about personal gains and losses, do not bring personal emotions, put the public first, and at the same time emphasize that we should look at the mainstream, essence, and major principles of cadres. After these leading cadres have recognized, rectified, and begun to correct their mistakes, we boldly liberate them and unite with them to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

"In the past, you fought against me, and now you liberate me, how can I come down from the stage?!" This idea is another obstacle to uniting with the majority and liberating a large number. Some are worried that if they liberate the cadres they have fought against, others will say they have made a wrong direction. Some are even worried about being struck back and wearing glass shoes. This idea is wrong. First of all, it is wrong to start from selfishness rather than public-mindedness. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All words and actions of communists must take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." From this highest standard, we dare to insist on the truth and also dare to correct mistakes. For cadres who have made mistakes, we not only dare to criticize and struggle against them, but also dare to clarify the facts in a realistic way. The idea of not daring to liberate cadres for fear of being struck back is also wrong in not believing in the majority of cadres. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: believe in the majority of cadres and the masses, this is the most basic principle. Even if some bad people take advantage of the liberation of cadres, there is nothing to be afraid of. If we make a mistake in liberating cadres, with the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses tempered by the Cultural Revolution, we will eventually expose them.

Whether to dare to unite with the majority ultimately depends on whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Being loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public good. Breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness means fundamentally raising one's understanding and feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by being infinitely loyal, firm, and unshakable in one's belief in Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can one correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy and achieve the goal of uniting with the majority and striking at the handful.

Support and supervise, help cadres who have stood up to continue the revolution

After cadres who have made mistakes have stood up through the criticism and help of the masses, there are generally three situations: the first is that they have truly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in thought, emotion, and stance, and can think and act together with the proletarian revolutionaries; the second is that they want to stand with the proletarian revolutionaries, but due to the deep influence of the capitalist reactionary line and the "four olds," they change slowly, do not yet fully understand the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and still have some distance in thought and emotion; the third is that a few people have relapsed into their old ways, remaining the same, using old orders and old rules in their work, and feeling somewhat incompatible with the proletarian revolutionaries in emotion. In view of these three situations, we adopt the approach of supporting and supervising cadres who have made mistakes and stood up.

Support and supervision are two aspects of a contradictory unity, and while supporting, supervision is needed, and supervision is for better support. Cadres who have made mistakes and stood up have a good essence and mainstream, and have already recognized and begun to correct their mistakes, so we firmly support them, respect their leadership; some people are not yet bold enough in their work at the beginning, so we actively report and seek instructions on work, establishing their leadership prestige. At the same time, we adopt an attitude of continuous revolution, supervising them to resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought, supervising them to correct mistakes, supervising them to change their old rules, helping them to become more revolutionary in thought. We neither do not support, do not trust, or do not respect their leadership because they have made mistakes in the past; nor do we no longer help them or dare to criticize them because they have stood up. Some people, at the beginning of the movement, influenced by the capitalist reactionary line, regarded cadres who had made mistakes as completely worthless and wanted to firmly overthrow them; but after these cadres stood up, they praised them as completely flawless, thinking that it was wrong to criticize and supervise them. This attitude of negating everything and affirming everything is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regularly review work, and in the review, promote democratic style, fear no criticism and self-criticism, ... this is the only effective way to resist the invasion of various political dust and political microorganisms into the thoughts of our comrades and the body of our Party." We deeply realize that the rectification and liberation of cadres who have made mistakes is only a new starting point for revolutionization, and they still need to be with the masses for a long time, jointly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and continuously transform themselves, accelerating thought revolutionization. The revolutionary masses continue to supervise, criticize, and help cadres who have made mistakes, which is not to pull their legs, but the best protection and support.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism may be possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful and trouble-free. Be very vigilant and never lose vigilance." The revolutionary spirit, critical spirit, and fighting spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries must be continued and carried forward. We must not fall into the trap of the slave mentality, "accommodation," and "tame tool" spread by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and their black "Cultivation," and we must strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. For correct leadership that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlights proletarian politics, and has revolutionary enthusiasm, we firmly obey and firmly support; for actions that violate Mao Zedong Thought, we must firmly struggle and continue to rebel.

    坚决照毛主席的指示办事，正确对待犯错误的干部
    空军直属机关　红哨兵
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，要相信和依靠干部的大多数。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，要团结大多数，打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却疯狂地实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。这是在干部问题上两条根本对立的路线。经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命的实践，充分证明毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是无比英明、无比正确的。我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的，走资本主义道路的当权派仅仅是一小撮。但是，也有些干部由于受党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所推行的资产阶级反动路线的影响，由于活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观不够，曾经犯了不同程度的错误。对这些犯错误的干部采取什么态度，是干部问题上两条路线斗争的关键问题。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派竭力散布“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的无政府主义口号，千方百计欺骗和蒙蔽群众，打击犯有错误但并不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的领导干部，企图搅乱阶级阵线，达到保护他们自己的目的。我们无产阶级革命派坚定不移地听毛主席的话，执行毛主席的干部政策，坚决抵制和批判了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，对于犯有错误但不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的干部，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，运用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，一方面严肃地批评他们的错误，一方面热情地支持和帮助他们站出来，和无产阶级革命派一道，大造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造空军领导机关中一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造头脑中私字的反，从而达到了“团结大多数，打击一小撮”，使空军领导机关的无产阶级文化大革命运动胜利地向前发展。
    狠斗一小撮，促进犯错误的干部自己解放自己
    毛主席教导我们：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”这就是说，要团结大多数，打击一小撮，而“团结大多数”和“打击一小撮”，是一个矛盾统一体中的两个侧面，只有狠狠地打击一小撮，才能团结大多数；也只有团结大多数，才能更狠、更准地打击一小撮。我们遵照毛主席的教导，不管有多大干扰，多大冲击，从运动开始直到现在，一直把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，硬是一抓到底，一斗到底，有力地促进了犯错误的干部自己解放自己，又快又好地团结了干部大多数。
    狠斗一小撮，能够最好地考验干部，分清干部是属于哪一个司令部的人。看一个干部是不是革命的，主要是看他对毛主席和毛泽东思想是不是拥护，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其推行的资产阶级反动路线是不是反对。而党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打着红旗反红旗，手段很隐蔽，蒙蔽了一些干部跟着他们跑，使阶级阵线混淆不清。我们狠斗一小撮，就能最有效地分清敌我友。一切属于无产阶级司令部里的干部，必然仇恨一小撮，积极地揭露和无情地斗争一小撮；一切属于资产阶级黑司令部里的人，必定千方百计地保护一小撮，千方百计要保他们蒙混过关；一些受蒙蔽而暂时认识不清的干部，在斗争中必然会逐渐地分清敌我，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和无产阶级革命派这边来。
    狠斗一小撮，能够最好地教育干部，特别是教育犯错误的干部迅速地提高觉悟。一些犯有错误但不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的干部，由于受资产阶级反动路线的影响，受《修养》的毒害，由于资产阶级世界观没有彻底改造，受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，在运动初期，很不觉悟，他们保走资本主义道路当权派，有的甚至和我们对立的很厉害。如果我们不是狠斗一小撮，而是把矛头指向这些犯错误的干部，就会上了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的当。我们牢记毛主席关于好人是多数、坏人是少数的教导，集中火力，狠斗一小撮，结果，受蒙蔽的干部纷纷觉悟，随着斗争的深入发展，他们都纷纷站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，反戈一击，向一小撮开火。
    狠斗一小撮，给犯错误的干部“亮相”和杀回马枪提供了最好的机会。我们对干部的解放，不是抱恩赐观点，而是在斗争中，帮助干部自己解放自己。狠斗一小撮，就能很好地起到帮助干部自己解放自己的作用。许多犯错误的干部，由于他们过去和走资本主义道路当权派接触较多，了解的情况也较多，随着他们在斗争中觉悟的提高，纷纷揭发出别人所不容易了解的内幕材料，有些还逐渐地成为对一小撮作斗争的有力“射击手”、“爆破手”，他们也就逐渐得到了群众的信任。
    我们的实践经验证明：哪一个单位狠斗一小撮的工作抓得紧、抓得狠，哪个单位犯错误的干部就杀出来得快，团结大多数的工作就做得好。
    公字当头，敢于团结和解放犯错误的干部
    对于犯错误的干部，在狠斗一小撮的过程中经过锻炼和考验之后，我们遵照毛主席要注意团结一切可以团结的人们的教导，遵照十六条上“经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部”的指示，敢于大胆地团结他们，敢于大胆地解放他们。
    犯错误的干部和我们的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾。所以我们对犯错误的干部采取的态度应是既严肃认真，又积极热情，对他们采取的办法是又烧又保。保的是他们拥护毛主席、拥护毛泽东思想的主流，烧的是他们的缺点、错误和资产阶级反动路线在他们头脑中的流毒。对他们的缺点错误，毫不留情地揭发批判，但不是全盘否定他们、打倒他们，而是实事求是、与人为善地帮助他们认识错误、检讨错误，团结他们共同对敌。
    敢不敢团结和解放犯错误的干部，热情地帮助他们站出来，关键是要破私立公，做到公字当头。
    “对犯错误干部的态度‘左’比右好。‘左’是认识问题，右是立场问题。认识问题没关系，立场问题了不得。”这种宁“左”勿右的思想是团结干部大多数的一个重要障碍。这是资产阶级反动路线的流毒。实质上，“左”和右都是一样地违背毛泽东思想的，都是危害革命事业的。宁“左”勿右，实际上就是形“左”实右。采取这种“左”的错误政策，就会造成打击一大片，犯了毛主席所批评的“‘为渊驱鱼，为丛驱雀’，把‘千千万万’和‘浩浩荡荡’都赶到敌人那一边去，只博得敌人的喝采”的错误，结果是壮大敌人，孤立自己，最后是保护了一小撮。这种宁“左”勿右的思想，不是从毛泽东思想、从革命利益去考虑问题，而是从个人犯不犯错误的私利去对待问题。这样，从私字出发去造反，就会越造越“反”。
    在斗争中掺杂个人的恩怨、得失、感情，以此来决定对某一个干部团结与否、解放与否，是对团结干部大多数的另一个障碍。有这样一种领导干部，他们在大节上是好的，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，走社会主义道路，但在小节上有严重的缺点错误，如工作方法简单，对下级态度生硬粗暴，等等，群众对他们这一方面反感较大。有的同志就抓住这样的干部不放，检查多次不让过关。我们组织大家学习毛主席的“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的教导，对待这样的领导干部，不计个人恩怨，不顾个人得失，不带个人感情，公字当头，同时强调对干部要看主流、看本质、看大节，在这些领导干部认识、检讨并且已经开始改正错误之后，大胆解放他们，团结他们一起狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    “过去斗了你，现在又解放你，我怎么下台？！”这种思想是团结大多数、解放一大片的又一个障碍。有的耽心把自己斗过的干部解放了，别人会说自己大方向错了。甚至有人耽心以后受打击报复，穿玻璃小鞋。这种思想是错误的。首先是错在私字当头而不是公字当头。毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”从这个最高标准出发，我们勇于坚持真理，也勇于修正错误。我们对犯错误的干部，不仅敢于批评、斗争，而且敢于实事求是地给他澄清事实。那种怕打击报复而不敢解放干部的思想，还错在不相信干部的大多数，我们牢记毛主席的教导：相信大多数干部和群众，这是最基本的一条。即使在解放干部中被个别坏人钻了空子，也没有什么可怕，解放错了，有光焰无际的毛泽东思想，有经过文化大革命锻炼的广大群众的革命造反精神，终究还是会把他们揪出来的。
    敢不敢于团结大多数，归根结底，是忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的问题。忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是最大的公。破私立公，就要从根本上提高对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的认识和感情。只有对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚，坚信不疑，坚定不移，才能正确地执行毛主席的干部政策，做到团结大多数，打击一小撮。
    一支持二监督，帮助站出来的干部不断革命
    犯错误的干部经过群众的批评帮助站出来之后，大体有三种情况：第一种是从思想上、感情上、立场上真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了，能够和无产阶级革命派想到一起，干到一起；第二种是想和无产阶级革命派站到一起了，但因受资产阶级反动路线和“四旧”的影响较深，改得不快，对群众的革命造反精神还不够理解，思想、感情上还有距离；第三种是有少数人故态复萌，依然故我，工作中依然沿用旧秩序、旧章法，对无产阶级革命派感情上有点格格不入。鉴于这三种情况，我们对犯错误而又站出来了的干部采取一支持、二监督的做法。
    支持和监督，也是一个矛盾统一体的两个侧面，在支持的同时需要监督，监督是为了更好的支持。犯错误而站出来了的干部，本质和主流是好的，又已经认识和开始改正了错误，我们就坚决支持他们，尊重他们的领导；有些人开始工作不够大胆，我们就主动地向他们汇报、请示工作，树立他们的领导威信。同时我们又以不断革命的态度，对他们实行监督，监督他们坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，监督他们改正错误，监督他们改变过去那一套旧章法，帮助他们更加思想革命化。我们既不因他过去犯过错误而不支持、不信任、不尊重他的领导；也不因他已经站出来就不再帮助他、不敢批评他。有的人在运动初期，受资产阶级反动路线的影响，把犯错误的干部看得一无是处，要坚决打倒；而在这些干部站出来之后，又把他们说成是一无缺点，认为再批评、监督他是不对的。这种否定一切、肯定一切的态度都是不符合毛泽东思想的。毛主席教导我们：“经常地检讨工作，在检讨中推广民主作风，不惧怕批评和自我批评，……正是抵抗各种政治灰尘和政治微生物侵蚀我们同志的思想和我们党的肌体的唯一有效的方法。”我们深刻地认识到，犯错误的干部检查、解放，只是革命化的新起点，他们还需要长期地同群众在一起，共同活学活用毛主席著作，开展批评和自我批评，不断地改造自己，加速思想革命化。革命群众对犯有错误的干部继续监督、批评、帮助，不是拆他的台，而是最好的保护和支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”无产阶级革命派的革命精神、批判精神、斗争精神要继续保持和发扬，我们绝不能再上党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其黑《修养》所散布的奴隶主义、“委曲求全”、“驯服工具”等那套修正主义破烂货的当，我们要加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，大立毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威。对于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、有革命干劲的正确领导，我们坚决服从，坚决拥护；对于违反毛泽东思想的言行，我们就要坚决斗争，继续造反。（新华社十日讯）
