I heard our great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" on the radio, and I was so moved that my blood boiled and tears welled up in my eyes. I couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" over and over again.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your shot is so wise, so great! This big-character poster is a powerful spiritual atomic bomb aimed at China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois headquarters headed by him. It is the order for the proletariat to launch a general offensive against the bourgeoisie, and the battle cry to open a new era of the communist movement.

Over the past year, under Chairman Mao's call to "Bombard the Headquarters," the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country have launched a powerful and continuous attack on the bourgeois headquarters, winning one great victory after another. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party has been pulled down from his horse, and the "time bombs" buried in the party have been dug out one by one. China's Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism has been foiled!

However, "the enemy will not perish of itself." The recent serious political incident in our Wuhan area fully proves this. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, together with a small group of bad leaders in the "million-strong army" and the "public security, procuratorate, and court," are making a desperate struggle with tenfold ferocity and a hundredfold increase in hatred. They distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, and brutally suppress the proletarian revolutionary cadres. They openly bombard the proletarian headquarters, attempting to extinguish the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area at one stroke. We, the people's liberation army and the proletarian revolutionary cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, have fought bravely and selflessly. We have finally smashed the enemy's desperate counterattack, defended the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and upheld Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

From this serious political incident in Wuhan, we deeply feel that although China's Khrushchev has been pulled down from his horse and a small group of capitalist-roaders in various regions have been exposed, they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. This group of poisonous snakes is still poisoning some of the masses, uniting conservative forces, and making a desperate counterattack. The proletarian revolutionary cadres must never relax their vigilance.

We, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan area, must respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary cadres across the country. With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will concentrate our firepower and targets, and strike the bourgeois headquarters with devastating blows, exposing, criticizing, and overthrowing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically!

"In June, the heavenly soldiers march to exterminate corruption, and a ten-thousand-foot rope is needed to bind the rocs." In the great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the party, we, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and on the side of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. We are determined to build new merits by thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters!

    给资产阶级司令部以毁灭性打击
    武汉部队某部营长　栾庆祥
    我从广播里，听了我们最伟大的领袖毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报，激动得热血沸腾，热泪盈眶，禁不住一遍又一遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席呵，毛主席！您老人家这一炮，是多么英明，多么伟大啊！您这张大字报，是投向中国的赫鲁晓夫和以他为首的资产阶级司令部的威力无比的精神原子弹，是无产阶级向资产阶级发起总攻击的动员令，是开辟共产主义运动新纪元的战斗号角。
    一年来，在毛主席的“炮打司令部”的号召下，全国广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，向资产阶级司令部发动了强大的连续的进攻，夺取了一个又一个伟大胜利。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派被拉下了马，埋在党内的“定时炸弹”一个一个地被挖了出来，中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋宣告破产了！
    但是，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”最近，在我们武汉地区所发生的严重的政治事件，就充分证明了这一点。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人，纠合“百万雄师”和“公检法”中的一小撮坏头头，以十倍的疯狂，百倍增长的仇恨，作拚死的挣扎。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，对无产阶级革命派进行疯狂的镇压，明目张胆地炮打无产阶级司令部，妄图一举扑灭武汉地区文化大革命的熊熊烈火。我们无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军和无产阶级革命派，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在党中央的英明领导下，奋不顾身，英勇斗争，终于粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，保卫了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    从武汉这一严重的政治事件中，我们深深地体会到，中国的赫鲁晓夫虽然被我们拉下了马，各地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派虽然被揪出来了，但他们人还在，心不死。这群毒蛇，还在继续毒害一部分群众，纠合保守势力，进行疯狂的反扑。无产阶级革命派千万不能放松警惕。
    我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派和广大解放军指战员，一定要响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，同全国无产阶级革命派一起并肩战斗，以毛泽东思想为武器，集中火力，集中目标，给资产阶级司令部以毁灭性打击，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭露、大批判、大斗争中，我们解放军指战员坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，站在无产阶级革命派一边，决心为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部建立新的功劳！（附图片）
    首都无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼毛主席的大字报《炮打司令部》发表一周年。
