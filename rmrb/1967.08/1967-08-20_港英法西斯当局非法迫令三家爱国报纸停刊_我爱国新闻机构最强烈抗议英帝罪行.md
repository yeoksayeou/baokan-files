Hong Kong patriotic news organizations strongly protest the British imperialist crime

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 18th - Hong Kong patriotic news organizations issued statements today, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British authorities' fascist crime of illegally forcing three patriotic newspapers to cease publication.

After illegally abducting and "interrogating" five leaders of patriotic newspapers and printing companies, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, on the 17th, through the "court," under the pretext of "continuing to publish inflammatory news," brazenly ordered the forced cessation of publication of the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *New Noon News*, and *Tianfeng Daily*, further engaging in frenzied political persecution of patriotic newspapers.

The Hong Kong British authorities' attempt to suppress the sacred right to propagate Mao Zedong Thought is a fascist act that has aroused the extreme indignation of Hong Kong patriotic news workers. The staff of the three patriotic newspapers that were illegally forced to cease publication today published a joint edition and, on the first page, published a joint statement from the three newspapers' committee against British persecution and a "letter to compatriots," strongly protesting the British authorities' frenzied persecution.

The joint statement solemnly declares: The three newspapers will, in various forms, continue to meet with the broad readership, persist in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the sacred duty of anti-British resistance, firmly defend national dignity, and resolutely counter the British persecution plot, fighting alongside the broad patriotic compatriots and achieving victory together.

The joint statement points out: The British imperialist running dogs of the American empire, disregarding the condemnation of world public opinion, have become even more frenzied and desperate, using their rotten and stinking fascist laws to carry out serious political persecution against our three newspapers. The great Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are now in an era when imperialist systems are heading towards total collapse. The imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis. No matter how they continue to oppose the Chinese people, the Chinese people will certainly find a way to achieve final victory." The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. The British imperialists are trembling with fear. We are now watching them tremble and struggle to survive. The end of the Hong Kong British is not far off.

On the 17th, 94 patriotic news organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon issued a joint statement, strongly protesting the British imperialists' frenzied persecution of the three patriotic newspapers. The joint statement points out: The Hong Kong British authorities attempt to intimidate all patriotic newspapers and patriotic news workers by destroying the three patriotic newspapers and further aim to destroy all patriotic newspapers. The joint statement states: We hereby issue the sternest warning: The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately stop your atrocities and withdraw your black hands! Otherwise, the patriotic compatriots and news workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon will not let you off, and will definitely cut off your black hands! The joint statement solemnly declares: Patriotism is not a crime, resistance is justified! No one can deprive us of the right to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought and the heroic anti-British resistance struggle. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but this sacred right will not be violated! You may have a thousand ways to persecute us, but we will have ten thousand ways to counterattack! You think you can stop our patriotic anti-British voices with fascist measures like cessation of publication? That is absolutely impossible. You should be clear: if you do not stop your evil deeds, you should consider the serious consequences.

The above joint statement was jointly issued by the committees against British persecution of the following Hong Kong news organizations: *Wen Wei Po*, *Ta Kung Pao*, *New Evening News*, *Sing Tao Daily*, *Jing Bao*, *Midday News*, *Hong Kong Evening News*, *New Noon News*, *Tianfeng Daily*, *Economic Guide*, *Weekend News*, Nanchang Printing Company, Youli Printing Company, Hong Kong Printing and Publishing Company.

On the 18th, the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' committee against British persecution issued a statement solemnly declaring: The Hong Kong British authorities' "order to cease publication" of the three patriotic newspapers is completely illegal, as is the arrest, interrogation, and "sentencing" of our patriotic news workers and compatriots. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately revoke all illegal measures, quickly admit their guilt, otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this must be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities.

    港英法西斯当局非法迫令三家爱国报纸停刊
    我爱国新闻机构最强烈抗议英帝罪行
    据新华社香港十八日电　香港爱国新闻机构今天纷纷发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局非法迫令三家爱国报纸停刊的法西斯罪行。
    港英法西斯当局继非法绑架、非法“审讯”爱国报纸和印务公司五位负责人后，十七日又通过“法庭”，以所谓“继续刊出煽动性新闻”的莫须有“罪名”，悍然下令强迫《香港夜报》、《新午报》和《田丰日报》停刊，进一步对爱国报纸进行疯狂的政治迫害。
    港英当局妄图扼杀宣传毛泽东思想神圣权利的法西斯行径，激起香港爱国新闻工作者的无比愤慨。被非法迫令停刊的三家爱国报纸的职工极端蔑视港英的“停刊令”，今天出版了联合版，并在第一版刊登了三报反对港英迫害斗争委员会的联合声明和“告同胞书”，对港英的疯狂迫害提出最强烈的抗议。
    三报反对港英迫害斗争委员会的联合声明庄严宣布：三报决以各种形式与广大读者见面，坚持宣传毛泽东思想，宣传反英抗暴的神圣义务，坚决捍卫民族尊严，坚决回击港英的迫害阴谋，同广大爱国同胞战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    联合声明指出：甘充美帝帮凶的英帝破落户，不顾世界舆论的谴责，进一步疯狂，进一步挣扎，搬出腐朽腥臭的法西斯法律，对我三报作严重的政治迫害。伟大的毛主席教导我们：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中，不论他们还要如何继续反对中国人民，中国人民总是有办法取得最后胜利的。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的中国人民是无可匹敌的。英帝怕得要死，我们现在看着它颤栗，看着它苟延残喘，港英死期必不会远。
    港九十四个爱国新闻单位十七日发表联合声明，最强烈地抗议港英帝国主义对三家爱国报纸的疯狂迫害。联合声明指出：港英当局企图通过摧残三家爱国报纸，来达到恫吓所有爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者，并进一步摧残所有爱国报纸的目的。联合声明说：我们为此提出最严厉的警告，港英当局必须立即停止你们的暴行，收回你们的黑手！否则，港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者是决不会放过你们的，一定会斩断你们的黑手！联合声明庄严宣告：爱国无罪，抗暴有理！我们宣传伟大的毛泽东思想、宣传英勇的反英抗暴斗争的权利是谁也不能剥夺的。头可断，血可流，这一神圣的权利绝不容侵犯！你们有一千种迫害，我们将有一万种回击！你们想用停刊之类的法西斯手段，来停止我们爱国抗暴的声音是绝对办不到的。你们应该放清楚点，如不停止作恶，则应考虑严重后果。
    上述联合声明是由香港《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》、《商报》、《晶报》、《正午报》、《香港夜报》、《新午报》、《田丰日报》、《经济导报》、《周末报》、南昌印务公司、有利印务公司、香港报业印刷公司的反对港英迫害斗争委员会联合发出的。
    港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会十八日发表声明严正宣告：港英当局对三家爱国报纸的“停刊令”是完全非法的，对我爱国新闻工作者和爱国同胞的逮捕、审讯和“判刑”也是完全非法的，港英当局必须立即撤销所有的非法措施，赶快低头认罪，否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由港英负全责。
