African nationalist parties' representatives and fighters stationed in Cairo have warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its 40th anniversary. They pointed out that only by taking the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, learning from the People's Liberation Army, and following the path of armed struggle that the Chinese people have taken, can the oppressed peoples of the world rid themselves of the rule of imperialism and reactionaries and achieve true liberation.

The representative of the Basutoland Congress Party, Maphaphani, issued a statement saying that the great revolutionary victories achieved by the Chinese people through armed struggle are "the victories of Mao Zedong Thought." The statement said that the strategies and tactics of people's war developed by Chairman Mao in the Chinese revolution "are invincible and universally applicable wherever revolutionaries wage people's war."

The statement praised the great contributions made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The statement concluded: "Now, the People's Republic of China has become the most reliable base for the world revolution to thoroughly defeat imperialism led by the United States. Revolutionaries all over the world read the works of Mao Zedong with admiration and inspiration, determined to carry the struggle through to the end. Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

Angolan nationalist Nicola Viera said: "Under the guidance and instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people established their own army in the darkest period of their history." He said that this army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has become the strongest revolutionary army in the world today. This army can defend China's territorial integrity, resist any threats, and defeat any enemy. The formation of this powerful force is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The deputy secretary-general of the Swaziland Progressive Party, Nkosi, issued a statement saying that the Chinese people, relying on the People's Liberation Army personally created by Chairman Mao, have gone through decades of arduous struggle and achieved victory.

The statement quoted Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." The statement emphasized: "The Chinese people have set a good example for the oppressed peoples of the world. The only language that imperialists and their running dogs understand is the gun; the only path for the oppressed peoples to achieve liberation is armed struggle."

The representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, Sitole, said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army created and educated by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. It is a highly revolutionary, spirited, and vigorous army. The People's Liberation Army maintains a close relationship with the Chinese people, like fish and water." He stressed: "Chairman Mao's great military thoughts on people's army and people's war are universally applicable to the oppressed peoples. The People's Liberation Army is a great example for the oppressed peoples to learn from. The Soviet revisionists advocate seeking independence through peaceful negotiations, which is sheer nonsense. Armed struggle is the only path for the oppressed peoples to achieve liberation."

Sitole said: "The freedom fighters of Mozambique are eagerly learning and applying the great Mao Zedong Thought under their own specific conditions. They rely on their own strength to carry out the struggle, establish bases in the countryside, and mobilize the masses. We oppressed Africans will combine the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with the actual situation in Mozambique and will surely defeat the paper tiger of Portuguese colonialism."

The representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in Cairo, Mbenjola, said in congratulating the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its 40th anniversary: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the people of the world in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and all kinds of reactionaries." Mbenjola called on all revolutionaries to seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to achieve victory in their own struggles. He also shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

    非洲民族主义战士盛赞我人民解放军是最强大的革命军队
    武装斗争是被压迫人民获得解放的唯一道路
    据新华社开罗一日电  非洲民族主义政党驻开罗的代表和民族主义战士热烈祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年。他们指出，只有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指导，以人民解放军为榜样，走中国人民走过的武装斗争的道路，全世界被压迫人民才能摆脱帝国主义和反动派的统治，获得真正的解放。
    巴苏陀兰大会党代表马帕法尼发表声明说，中国人民通过武装斗争所取得的革命的伟大胜利，“是毛泽东思想的胜利”。声明说，毛主席在中国革命中所发展的人民战争的战略战术，“在革命者进行人民战争的任何地方，都是战无不胜的，放之四海而皆准的。”
    声明赞扬了中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中所作出的巨大贡献。声明最后说：“现在，中华人民共和国已经成为彻底打败以美国为首的帝国主义的世界革命的最可靠的根据地。全世界的革命者怀着敬佩和鼓舞的心情读毛泽东的著作，要把斗争进行到底。中国人民解放军万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
    安哥拉民族主义者尼古拉·维埃拉说：“根据伟大领袖毛主席的教导和指示，中国人民在他们历史上最黑暗的年代里建立了自己的军队。”他说，由毛泽东思想武装起来的这支军队今天已经成为世界上最强大的革命军队，这支军队能够保卫中国的领土完整，反对任何威胁，打败任何敌人。这一强大力量的形成是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    斯威士兰进步党副总书记恩科西发表声明说，中国人民依靠这支由毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军经过了数十年艰苦卓绝的斗争，取得了胜利。
    声明引述了毛主席的教导：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”声明强调说：“中国人民为全世界被压迫人民树立了一个良好的榜样。帝国主义者和他们的走狗所能懂得的唯一的语言是枪杆子；我们被压迫人民取得解放的唯一道路是进行武装斗争。”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会代表西托尔说：“中国人民解放军是毛主席和中国共产党缔造和教育出来的军队，这是一支高度革命化、斗志昂扬、意气风发的军队。人民解放军同中国人民保持着象鱼和水那样的亲密关系。”他强调指出：“毛主席关于人民军队和人民战争的伟大的军事思想，对被压迫人民是普遍适用的，人民解放军是被压迫人民学习的伟大榜样。苏联修正主义者鼓吹通过和平谈判乞求独立，完全是胡说八道。武装斗争才是被压迫人民求得解放的唯一道路。”
    西托尔说：“莫三鼻给自由战士如饥似渴地在本国的具体条件下学习和运用伟大的毛泽东思想。他们依靠自己的力量开展斗争，在农村建立根据地，发动群众。我们被压迫的非洲人把战无不胜的毛泽东思想同莫三鼻给的实际情况结合起来，一定能打败葡萄牙殖民主义纸老虎。”
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻开罗代表门贝朔腊在祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年时说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是同帝国主义、殖民主义和形形色色反动派进行斗争的全世界人民的伟大领袖。”门贝朔腊号召一切革命者认真学习和运用毛泽东思想，以争取自己斗争的胜利。他还高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”
