"Beijing supports you!" What a stirring slogan! What a powerful voice!

Seeing the inspiring scenes in the documentary "Beijing Supports You," the angry and passionate parade, the enthusiastic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the familiar faces of central leaders, and the red banners waving in the wind... so many memories come flooding back.

During the days when the bourgeois reactionary line was rampant, it was the Beijing breeze that swept away the dark clouds over Wuhan; it was the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought that illuminated the city of Wuhan.

Since February and March of this year, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the Wuhan area, in collusion with China's Khrushchev, stirred up a counterrevolutionary wind. The "Steel General Headquarters" was labeled as "counterrevolutionary"; fellow revolutionaries of the "Steel General Headquarters," such as "Steel 9.13" and "Steel Second Headquarters," and other revolutionary comrades were also persecuted and attacked. White terror once again descended upon the city of Wuhan. In those days of arduous struggle, we proletarian revolutionaries, with the utmost respect, listened to the voice of Beijing.

Darkness has finally passed, and people from Beijing have arrived! Our beloved Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao, came to Wuhan to handle the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area. This is Chairman Mao's greatest support for us! This is Beijing's greatest support for us!

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the Wuhan area, the "Million Heroes," and the handful of bad leaders in the "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line were terrified and hated the arrival of Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li. They brazenly defied the central authorities and fiercely attacked the proletarian headquarters.

At this critical moment, the voice of Beijing, like a thunderous spring thunder, shattered the sky over Wuhan and smashed the dreams of a handful of reactionaries to restore capitalism!

Chairman Mao is always with us! Beijing is always with us!

Chairman Mao supports us! We proletarian revolutionaries vow to make Chairman Mao proud! We are determined to forever follow Chairman Mao and be revolutionaries for life.

Now, the powerful political offensive of the proletarian revolutionaries has put China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area in a situation of isolation and desperation. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The enemy's isolation does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory." To achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must maintain a clear political mind, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and resolutely implement the Party's policies.

China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area have not given up their failure. They are still trying every means to counterattack. The facts tell us that we must never forget the enemy and must always be vigilant against the enemy's revenge. We must carry on Lu Xun's spirit of "beating the fallen dog to death," pursue and attack, and push the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area to a new high.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One is the unity within the Party, and the other is the unity between the Party and the people. These are the priceless treasures to overcome difficulties, and all Party comrades must cherish these two priceless treasures." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless to the enemy, crush it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." What profound teachings! What important instructions! At this moment, when the proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive phase of great criticism and great struggle, we must remember these teachings and act strictly according to them to achieve revolutionary unity, so as to strike the enemy more powerfully.

In the struggle, it is inevitable that there will be some differences and contradictions among the revolutionaries. Whether we can correctly handle these differences and contradictions will be a major political test for us. We must pass this test and quickly achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. This is because we have a common enemy—the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, a common goal—to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and a common basis for unity—the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought.

The process of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries is also a process of self-transformation for each of us. We have long made up our minds not to seek personal fame and gain, not to quarrel over personal gains and losses, and to thoroughly examine our souls in this great revolutionary movement. We must sincerely and honestly engage in self-criticism and wage an uncompromising struggle against all non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. As for comrades, we should not settle old scores over past matters.

For those masses who were deceived into joining the "Million Heroes," we will not pursue any of them and will not take any revenge. As long as they correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will welcome them warmly and treat them equally.

Rest assured, beloved Chairman Mao! Rest assured, revolutionary comrades in Beijing and across the country! The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area will forever be loyal to the Party's cause, to the people, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We vow to be thorough revolutionaries!

### 永远忠于毛主席　誓做彻底的革命派——看纪录影片《北京支持你们》

    永远忠于毛主席　誓做彻底的革命派
    ——看纪录影片《北京支持你们》
    武汉钢二司战士　周文斌
    “北京支持你们！”这是多么激动人心的口号，这是多么坚强有力的声音。
    看到纪录影片《北京支持你们》里一个个令人鼓舞的场面，一支支愤怒激昂的游行队伍，一队队热情洋溢的解放军战士，一张张平易可亲的中央领导同志的面容，一面面迎风招展的鲜红的战旗，……多少往事，又重新在我眼前展现。
    在资产阶级反动路线猖獗的日子里，是北京的东风，横扫了武汉上空的乌云；是毛泽东思想的阳光，照亮了武汉的城头。
    今年二、三月份以来，武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，配合中国的赫鲁晓夫，刮起了一股反攻倒算的妖风。“钢工总”被打成了“反革命”；“钢工总”的战友“钢九·一三”、“钢二司”和其他革命同志也遭到迫害，受到打击。白色恐怖又一次降临江城。在那艰苦奋战的日日夜夜，我们无产阶级革命派时时刻刻都怀着崇高的敬意，倾听着北京的声音。
    黑暗终于过去了，北京派人来啦！我们敬爱的谢富治、王力同志接受伟大领袖毛主席的委托，来到了武汉，处理武汉地区的文化大革命的问题。这是毛主席对我们的最大支持！这是北京对我们的最大支持！
    武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、“百万雄师”和“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，对谢富治和王力同志的到来怕得要死，恨得要命。他们不顾一切，赤膊上阵，公然对抗中央，疯狂地炮打无产阶级司令部。
    在这一严重时刻，北京的声音，象一声震天动地的春雷，划破了江城的长空，粉碎了一小撮反动家伙复辟资本主义的美梦！
    毛主席无时无刻不在支持我们！北京无时无刻不在支持我们！
    毛主席他老人家为我们撑腰，我们无产阶级革命派誓为毛主席争气！我们决心永远紧跟毛主席，干一辈子革命。
    现在，无产阶级革命派的强大政治攻势，已经使得中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人陷于众叛亲离、十分孤立、十分狼狈的境地。可是，事情正象毛主席所指出的那样，“敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”我们要取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，就必须保持清醒的政治头脑，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，坚决执行党的政策。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在武汉地区的代理人，并没有甘心自己的失败。他们还在千方百计地伺机反扑。事实告诉我们，任何时候也不能忘记敌人，任何时候也不能放松对于阶级敌人疯狂报复阴谋的警惕性。我们一定要发扬鲁迅的“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，穷追猛打，把武汉地区的文化大革命运动推向一个更新的高潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“一种是党内的团结，一种是党与人民的团结，这些就是战胜艰难环境的无价之宝，全党同志必须珍爱这两个无价之宝。”毛主席又教导我们：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”这是何等深切的教诲，这是何等重要的指示！在当前，无产阶级文化大革命进入大批判、大斗争的决战时刻，我们更应牢牢记住这些教导，严格地按照这些教导办事，实现革命的大联合，才能更有力地打击敌人。
    在斗争中，革命派之间出现一些分歧，产生一些矛盾，是难免的。能不能正确地对待和处理这些分歧和矛盾，将是对我们的一个重大的政治考验。我们一定能经得住这个考验，一定能迅速地实现无产阶级革命派的大联合。这是因为，我们有着共同的敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，有着共同的奋斗目标——把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，有着共同的团结基础——光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    无产阶级革命派大联合的过程，对我们每一个人来说，也是一个自我思想改造的过程。我们早就下定了决心，不争个人名利，不闹个人得失，一定要在这场伟大的革命运动中狠触自己的灵魂，认真地、诚恳地进行自我批评，同自己头脑中的各种非无产阶级思想进行不调和的斗争。对于同志，过去的事情就不要再算老账。
    对于那些受蒙蔽参加“百万雄师”的群众，我们一律不予追究，一律不进行任何报复。只要他们改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，我们就热情欢迎，平等相待。
    请放心吧，敬爱的毛主席！请放心吧，北京和全国的革命战友！我们武汉地区广大的无产阶级革命战士，一定永远忠于党的事业，忠于人民，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓做彻底的革命派！
