Today, our newspaper reprints an article from the Shanghai *Worker Rebel News* titled "The Trend of Parading in Cars Must Be Stopped," along with a reader's letter and an editorial note. This letter and note raise a question of general significance, reflecting the voices of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary factions of the proletariat nationwide, and it is worthy of serious attention.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have recently called upon the people of the nation to further implement frugality to make the revolution. Resolutely carrying out this great call is of profound political significance for ensuring the smooth progress of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for better preventing the infiltration of revisionism, and for promoting the thought revolutionization of our people.

Recently, in some places, there has been a trend of parading in cars. This does not conform to Chairman Mao's directive of "frugality to make the revolution" and must be stopped immediately.

Our cars are the property of the state and collective, serving production, construction, and transportation. No organization or individual should use them at will. Parading in cars not only damages the vehicles and wastes gasoline but also easily causes traffic congestion and accidents. Every revolutionary mass organization should take stopping the use of cars for parading as a concrete measure to implement the policy of frugality to make the revolution.

It is entirely necessary and a revolutionary action to hold demonstrations and parades to denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and to support the revolutionary struggles of the proletarian revolutionary factions in various places and the peoples of the world. However, we should advocate the spirit of hard struggle and carry forward the fine traditions of the old Eighth Route Army, marching with our own two legs and demonstrating to the enemies of the proletariat with vigorous steps.

We, the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, should always put the interests of the state first and consider the overall situation of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must consciously become models of frugality to make the revolution, acting as masters of the state to save every drop of oil, every grain of rice, every unit of electricity, every inch of cloth, every sheet of paper, every piece of coal, every piece of timber, and every inch of steel. The printing of various propaganda materials should be effective and avoid waste. Writing big-character posters and large slogans should be mindful of saving resources and should make full use of waste paper and other substitutes. For state property and funds, if they can be not used, they should not be used; if they can be used less, they should be used less; if they can be used or not used, they should definitely not be used. Seeing the phenomenon of wasting state property and damaging public property, everyone must resolutely oppose, resolutely resist, and resolutely fight against it. Those who damage state and collective property must be subjected to proletarian dictatorship, and they must be severely punished according to the severity of their actions. We must create a strong public opinion that "frugality is glorious, waste is shameful, and destruction is a crime," and carry out the frugality to make the revolution movement thoroughly, comprehensively, and persistently.

An important feature of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is to oppose the capitalist road and to strengthen and consolidate the socialist system, protecting socialist ownership from infringement. All production resources and materials owned by the socialist state and collective are not subject to the disposal of any organization or individual. If the production resources and materials of the socialist state and people's communes are arbitrarily disposed of, it is a destruction of socialist ownership, which is absolutely not a revolutionary action of the proletariat but a destructive action of the bourgeoisie. This is what the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must resolutely oppose. We hope that all comrades of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat fully recognize the seriousness of this issue.

We, the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously publicize and actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "frugality to make the revolution." We must mobilize the masses, timely inspect the production and frugality situation of our units, take necessary measures, and solve existing problems. We must take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, use the deep criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party as the driving force, and further launch a new high tide of the production and frugality movement.

### 进一步实行节约闹革命

    进一步实行节约闹革命
    今天，本报转载了上海《工人造反报》发表的《必须刹住乘车游行风》的读者来信和编者按。这封读者来信和编者按，提出了一个具有普遍意义的问题，反映了全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的呼声，很值得大家重视。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央最近又向全国人民发出号召：要进一步节约闹革命。坚决地贯彻执行这一伟大号召，对于保证我国无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行，对于更好地防止修正主义的侵蚀，促进我国人民的思想革命化，具有极其深远的政治意义。
    近来，在一些地区出现了乘汽车游行之风。这是不符合毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的方针、原则的，必须迅速制止。
    我们的汽车，是国家和集体的财产，是为生产建设和交通运输服务的，任何团体和个人都不应该随便动用。乘汽车游行，既损耗车辆，浪费汽油，又容易阻塞交通，发生事故。每一个革命群众组织，都应当把制止使用汽车游行，作为贯彻节约闹革命方针的一项具体措施。
    举行示威游行，声讨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，支持各地无产阶级革命派和世界人民的革命斗争，是完全必要的，是革命的行动。但是，应当提倡我党艰苦奋斗的作风，发扬老八路的优良传统，迈开两条腿，以雄健的步伐向无产阶级的敌人示威。
    我们无产阶级革命派，一事当前，都要以国家利益为重，都要从社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的大局出发，必须自觉地成为节约闹革命的模范，以国家主人翁的姿态，为国家节约每一滴油，每一粒米，每一度电，每一寸布，每一张纸，每一块煤，每一根木料，每一吋钢材。各种宣传品的印制应当讲求实效，避免浪费。写大字报、大标语应当注意节约，并尽量利用废纸和其他代用品。对国家的物品和资金能不用的就不用，能少用的就少用，可用可不用的就坚决不用。看到浪费国家财产，破坏公共财物的现象，每个人都要坚决反对，坚决抵制，坚决作斗争。对破坏国家和集体财产的坏人，必须对他们实行无产阶级专政，按照情节轻重，严加惩办。要造成“节约光荣，浪费可耻，破坏有罪”的强烈社会舆论，把已经取得重大成果的节约闹革命的运动，全面地彻底地持久地进行下去。
    无产阶级专政下革命的一个重要特点，就是反对走资本主义道路，就是要加强与巩固社会主义制度，保护社会主义的所有制不受侵犯。凡属于社会主义国家所有和集体所有的生产资料和物资，任何团体和个人都无权支配。如果对社会主义国家的和人民公社的生产资料和物资任意支配，那就是破坏社会主义的所有制，那就绝不是无产阶级的革命行动，而是资产阶级的破坏性的行动。这是无产阶级文化大革命必须坚决反对的。我们希望一切无产阶级革命派的同志们，充分认识到这个问题的严重性。
    我们无产阶级革命派，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大张旗鼓地宣传和积极响应毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，放手发动群众，对本单位的增产节约情况及时进行检查，采取必要措施，解决存在的问题。要以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，以深入批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为动力，进一步掀起增产节约运动的新高潮。
