Japanese revolutionary leftists, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been vigorously resisting the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Soviet and Japanese revisionists. They have broken away from the control of the Kyuemon group and have rapidly grown in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. They are the vanguard of the Japanese revolution and the hope of the Japanese nation.

The revolutionary leftists of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee first rose up in September last year to oppose the Kyuemon group and established the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist). They raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified." Subsequently, the revolutionary leftists of the JCP prefectural committees in Saga, Aichi, Fukuoka, and Hyogo prefectures issued statements, breaking with the Kyuemon revisionist group and establishing leftist prefectural committees. They have engaged in a head-on struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries.

	The rebellion is good! It has broken the long-standing stagnation caused by the Kyuemon group's advocacy of "parliamentarism," "legalism," and "peaceful transition" revisionist lines, bringing new vitality to the Japanese revolution. Along with the establishment of the revolutionary prefectural committees in Yamaguchi and four other prefectures, and afterward, cities and rural areas from Kyushu in the south to Hokkaido in the north have established or are in the process of establishing many leftist branches or groups of the JCP. Original JCP Central Committee member and Secretariat member Yasai Kuraji also issued a statement in January this year, criticizing the Kyuemon group's revisionist program and pointing out that the Kyuemon group is a traitor to Marxism-Leninism.

	These true Japanese Marxist-Leninists, through their practical actions, have smashed the Kyuemon group's revisionist line of aligning with the Soviet Union, appeasing the United States, and betraying the Japanese revolution. They have established the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and are determined to build a genuine Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party, starting a new march for the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people.

	The rebellion is good! It has stirred up a revolutionary wave among the masses in Japan. Leftists and progressives in organizations such as the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization, journalists' organizations, women's groups, and trade organizations have successively broken with a small clique of Japanese revisionists in their respective organizations and established new progressive organizations. The Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) headquarters, since its establishment in October last year, has broken through numerous obstacles set by the Kyuemon group, forged ahead bravely, and rapidly grown in strength. Currently, in 42 of Japan's 46 prefectures, (Orthodox) headquarters organizations have been established. These organizations were established through arduous struggles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Kyuemon revisionist group who harbor hostility towards China and sabotage Japan-China friendship. They possess an invincible spirit and strength.

	Japanese revolutionary leftists and progressive organizations have a distinctive feature: they have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and an infinite faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They take Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their struggles.

	The Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the JCP (Leftist) wrote in the inaugural issue of its publication "Revolutionary Warrior": "Chairman Mao Zedong is the great leader of our time. The theory and thought he created are the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Now, socialist China with a population of 700 million, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao at its helm, is bravely standing up, relying on the self-awareness of the proletariat and the masses, and is vigorously carrying out the great proletarian cultural revolution of epoch-making significance, aiming to elevate proletarian dictatorship and socialist construction to a more solid and advanced stage." The Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the JCP (Leftist) called for "further arming the entire prefectural party organization with Mao Zedong Thought" and decided to make Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and "Against Liberalism" mandatory reading for the entire prefectural party.

	The JCP Saga Prefecture Committee (Leftist) unanimously affirmed Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the revolution at its founding conference and emphasized that the revolutionary leftists should actively engage in mass anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles. The JCP Aichi Prefecture Committee (Leftist) issued a statement to the people at its founding conference: "We are determined to unite closely with the revolutionary masses of the entire prefecture, 'with the new era's Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, inherit Japan's revolutionary tradition, become a part of the international united front against the United States, and fulfill the role of the vanguard party of the Japanese revolution.'"

	Recently, the newly established JCP Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Leftist) stated in its declaration: "In the future, we will follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, walk the true revolutionary path, temper ourselves in the fiery struggles of the masses, wash away past erroneous thoughts, not only take the objective world as the object of our revolution, but also take ourselves as the object of our revolution, strive to transform ourselves, and serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly."

	In the movement of Japanese revolutionary leftists actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, revolutionaries led by Nishizawa Ryuji and Otsuka Yushu established the Mao Zedong Thought Research Society and published the "Mao Zedong Thought Research" magazine, which has played a significant role in promoting the rebellious actions of Japanese revolutionary leftists and progressive organizations.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly inspired the rebellious spirit of the Japanese revolutionary leftists. They have seen through the "parliamentary struggle" and "peaceful transition" advocated by the Kyuemon group as revisionist goods, serving to consolidate the bourgeois dictatorship. They understand that the central issue of the proletarian revolution is the issue of power, which is to smash the old state machine and establish a new state machine. Just last October, when the Japanese revisionists held their 10th Congress, ranting about "peaceful transition" and fiercely attacking Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary faction of the JCP issued a statement: "Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' We should not forget this truth. 'The Japanese people must be prepared to seize power.'"

	The rebellious actions of the Japanese revolutionary leftists have smashed the shackles of the Kyuemon group's revisionist line and shattered the beautiful dreams of a group of "parliamentary enthusiasts." They are trembling with fear, hastily taking the field, fiercely denouncing the revolutionary leftists, and colluding with the Sato government to carry out suppression. They even use the despicable method of informing on others to politically frame the revolutionary leftists.

	However, the Japanese people want revolution, and the emergence of revolutionary leftists rising up is an inevitable trend of historical development. Whether it is the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries or the Japanese revisionist Kyuemon group, they cannot stop the advance of the Japanese revolution. Chairman Mao said: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheels of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

	Today, although the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese revisionist Kyuemon group are joining forces to suppress the Japanese revolution, and although there are still many difficulties and problems facing the revolutionary leftists, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the future of the Japanese revolution. The forces of the Japanese revolutionary leftists are gathering, uniting, and growing stronger. The awakening of the Japanese people is rapidly increasing, and an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation is bound to come.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来大造美帝苏修日修和日本反动派的反
    日本革命左派力量在斗争中迅速发展壮大
    新华社十三日讯　本社记者报道：日本革命左派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造美日反动派的反，大造苏修日修的反。他们从宫本集团的控制下杀了出来，并在同帝修反的斗争中迅速成长。他们是日本革命的先锋，是日本民族的希望。
    日共山口县委的革命左派，在去年九月首先起来反对宫本集团，成立日本共产党山口县委员会（左派），打起了“造反有理”的大旗。随后，佐贺、爱知、福冈和兵库等县的日共县委会的革命左派，相继发表声明，同宫本修正主义集团决裂，成立左派的县委会，同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本的反动派展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    大破宫本集团修正主义路线
    这个反造的好！它打破了长年来由于宫本集团推行“议会主义”、“合法主义”、“和平过渡”的修正主义路线所造成的死气沉沉的局面，为日本的革命带来了新的生机。在山口县等五个革命的县委会成立的同时和在那以后，南起九州北至北海道的城市和农村，建立了或正在建立许多日共的左派支部或左派小组。原日共中央委员、书记处书记安斋库治也在今年一月里发表意见书，批判了宫本集团的修正主义纲领，指出宫本集团是马克思列宁主义的叛徒。
    这些真正的日本马克思列宁主义者的实际行动，大破宫本集团联苏降美反华、叛卖日本革命的修正主义路线，大立马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，并决心要建立一个真正的马克思列宁主义的革命政党，为日本人民的革命事业开始了新的进军。
    这个反造的好！它在日本的群众团体中卷起了革命巨澜。日中友好协会、亚非团结组织、记者组织、妇女团体以及贸易团体中的左派和进步人士，纷纷起来同有关团体中的一小撮日修分子决裂，成立新的进步组织。日中友好协会（正统）总部自从去年十月成立以来，冲破了宫本集团的重重阻碍，披荆斩棘，奋勇前进，力量迅速发展。目前，在日本四十六个都道府县中，已有四十二个都道府县成立了（正统）总部组织。这些组织都是在同敌视中国和破坏日中友好的美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团进行艰苦的斗争中建立起来的，它们具有不可战胜的气魄和力量。
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作
    日本革命左派和进步组织有一个显著的特点，那就是无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。它们以毛泽东思想作为行动指南，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。
    日共山口县委（左派）在它发行的刊物《革命战士》创刊号上写道：“毛泽东主席是当代伟大的领袖。他创造的思想和理论是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。现在有七亿人口的社会主义中国在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，正使革命的无产阶级和人民群众勇敢地站起来，依靠群众的自觉力量，胜利地开展着具有划时代意义的无产阶级文化大革命，以便把无产阶级专政和社会主义建设提高到更巩固、更高级的阶段。”日共山口县委（左派）号召“进一步用毛泽东思想武装全县党的各级组织”，决定把毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》作为全县党的必读文件。
    日本共产党佐贺（左派）县委会，在自己的成立大会上一致确认毛泽东思想为革命的指导思想，并强调革命的左派应积极地进行群众性反帝反修斗争。日共爱知县委（左派）在成立大会上发表告人民书说：我们决心同全县的革命群众紧密团结，“以伟大革命的新时代的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，继承日本的革命传统，成为反美国际统一战线的一部分，完成日本革命的先锋党的作用。”
    最近新成立的日共兵库县委（左派）发表的声明中说：“我们今后要在毛泽东思想的指导下，走真正的革命道路，在群众斗争的烈火中锻炼自己，冲洗过去的错误思想，不仅以客观世界为革命的对象，还要以自己为革命的对象，努力改造自己，使自己能够完全、彻底为人民服务。”
    在日本革命左派活学活用毛主席著作的运动中，以西泽隆二和大塚有章为首的一些革命者，创立了毛泽东思想研究会，主办了《毛泽东思想研究》杂志，对日本革命左派和进步组织的造反行动，起了很大的推动作用。
    决心打碎旧的国家机器
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，大大地鼓舞了日本革命左派的造反精神。他们看透了宫本集团所宣扬的“议会斗争”和“和平过渡”，都是修正主义货色，都是为巩固资产阶级政权服务的。他们懂得了无产阶级革命的中心问题是政权问题，是打碎旧的国家机器，建立新的国家机器。就在去年十月日修召开第十次代表大会，大谈“和平过渡”，疯狂攻击毛泽东思想的时候，日共革命派发表声明说：“毛泽东同志指出：‘枪杆子里面出政权。’我们不应该忘记这个真理”。“日本人民必须作好起来夺取政权的准备。”
    日本革命左派的造反行动，砸碎了宫本集团的修正主义路线的枷锁，冲散了一群“议会迷”的美梦。他们胆战心惊，仓惶出阵，大骂革命左派，并勾结佐藤政府进行镇压。他们甚至卑鄙地用告密的手段，对革命左派进行政治陷害。
    但是，日本人民是要革命的，日本出现革命左派起来造反，是历史发展的必然趋势。不管是美日反动派，还是日修宫本集团，他们都不能阻止日本革命的前进。毛主席说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    今天，尽管美日反动派、苏修和日修宫本集团联合起来镇压日本革命，尽管在革命左派的面前还存在着许多的困难和问题，但是，毛泽东思想的光芒照亮了日本革命的前途，日本革命左派的力量正在集结、联合和发展壮大，日本人民的觉悟正在迅速提高，一个空前大好的革命形势必将到来。
