		The two special envoys sent by U.S. President Johnson, Taylor and Clifford, have returned to Washington after visiting South Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.

		According to official U.S. sources and media reports, their mission was primarily to recruit cannon fodder for the Vietnam War and to prepare for the second Manila Conference scheduled for this autumn. However, it turns out that Johnson's two envoys returned empty-handed.

		Following the return of the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, to seek reinforcements, and after U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's visit to South Vietnam, Taylor and others hastily embarked on their tour, demanding that the U.S. allies provide more cannon fodder to alleviate the shortage of U.S. troops in Vietnam. This indicates that U.S. imperialism is indeed in dire straits in Vietnam.

		However, according to various sources, these U.S. allies, due to their own difficulties, are unwilling to take on specific obligations as requested by Taylor and others. The U.S. had high hopes for Thailand. However, the Thanom reactionary government is in a state of chaos due to the armed struggle of the Thai people, not only expressing its inability to send troops but also demanding that the U.S. accelerate the provision of military "aid" to deal with the people's armed forces.

		Australia stated that it is currently unable to "take on further significant military obligations." To avoid this haggling, the Philippines simply "turned away" Taylor, forcing the two U.S. presidential envoys to temporarily cancel their planned trip to Manila. In Seoul, the U.S. originally intended to buy a division of cannon fodder at a high price to strengthen the South Korean puppet army. However, the Seoul authorities expressed their inability to provide reinforcements even before Taylor's arrival.

		The only somewhat positive result was the announcement by the Saigon puppet regime that, due to the U.S. promise of providing weapons and equipment, the puppet army would be expanded by 70,000. But these are mostly local forces and puppet militias. Even if these new recruits are assembled, they will be of little use. No wonder the Associated Press commented: "Taylor's trip shows the president is in a predicament."

### 南朝鲜、泰国和澳大利亚等仆从自顾不暇无力增援  泰勒搜罗侵越炮灰空手而归

    南朝鲜、泰国和澳大利亚等仆从自顾不暇无力增援
    泰勒搜罗侵越炮灰空手而归
    本报讯　美国总统约翰逊派出的两名特使泰勒和克利福德，在先后访问了南越、泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰和南朝鲜之后，已经回到华盛顿。
    据美国官方和报刊的透露，他们此行的使命，主要是为了搜罗侵越炮灰，和为预定要在今年秋天举行的第二次马尼拉会议做准备。但是事实表明，约翰逊的这两名特使，是空手而归的。
    泰勒等人紧接着侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰回国讨救兵，和美国国防部长麦克纳马拉九去南越之后，立即匆匆出访，要求仆从提供更多炮灰来缓和侵越美军兵力不足的矛盾，说明了美帝国主义在南越实在已经到了山穷水尽的地步。
    但是，据各方消息看来，美国的这些仆从，由于自顾不暇，对泰勒等人所求都不愿承担具体义务。美国对于泰国本来寄予不少希望。但是他侬反动政府被泰国人民武装斗争弄得焦头烂额，不但表示无兵可派，反而要求美国加速提供军“援”以对付人民武装。
    澳大利亚声明目前无法“进一步承担重大的军事义务”。菲律宾为了避免这一场讨价还价，干脆对泰勒进行“挡驾”，使这两个美国总统特使不得不临时取消计划中的马尼拉之行。在汉城，美国原想用高价收买一个师的炮灰来加强南朝鲜帮凶军，但是汉城当局还在泰勒到达之前就表示无力增援。
    唯一可以算得上有点结果的，是西贡傀儡集团宣布，由于美国答应提供武器装备，伪军将扩充七万人。但主要都是些地方部队和傀儡民团。这批乌合之众的新兵即使拼凑起来，也顶不了啥用。难怪美联社的评论要说：“泰勒此行表明总统处于困境”。
