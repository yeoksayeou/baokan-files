In the great new era of world revolution shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the new high tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another heroic figure's name has been inscribed in the annals of international proletarian revolutionary struggle!

This is a great internationalist warrior; this is a Chinese red overseas warrior; he is the excellent example we should always learn from—Comrade Liu Yi, the martyr!

On June 28, the Ne Win reactionary government organized thugs to launch a savage attack on the Chinese Embassy in Burma. Our comrade Liu Yi was one of those who fought to the death against the thugs and died a heroic death. With his blood and life, he defended the dignity of our great motherland, strengthened the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Burmese reactionaries! He died for the people's interests, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai!

In late June, Yangon was a city of white terror, with Burmese fascist thugs running wild. At that time, the Burmese reactionary military police directed the thugs to carry out a horrifying massacre, mass arrests, looting, and arson against the patriotic overseas Chinese who love our great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions in Burma were repeatedly attacked, with windows smashed and the pillars of the embassy gates bent by the thugs. The Ne Win reactionary government, with its frenzied anti-China actions, tore off the mask of "positive neutrality" and "Sino-Burma friendship" it had been wearing. It was in this cruel class struggle situation that Comrade Liu Yi returned to the embassy from the aid site in Burma.

The fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government aroused Comrade Liu Yi's immense class hatred. In a letter he wrote on the night of June 26, the hero's selfless, fearless, noble, and pure spiritual world was revealed. He wrote: "The Burmese reactionary government is deliberately worsening relations between the two countries, and the consequences are easy to imagine. ... Each of us comrades has prepared our minds, ... we are determined to fight to the end with the reactionaries." He said: "Tell Dad and Mom not to worry about me. Although we and the embassy staff are fewer in number than the special agents and thugs, we have the support of 700 million people in our motherland and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon. Our strength is invincible!"

In the early hours of June 28, as soon as Liu Yi arrived at the embassy, he joined everyone in preparing to resist the thugs. He poured his intense hatred for the enemy into every task. The more he thought of the suffering compatriots, the more he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "To defeat all enemies and never be defeated by them." The more he worked, the more energetic he became, working all morning without rest.

Around 1:00 PM, our comrades were having lunch when suddenly the anti-China shouts came closer. This was the signal that the thugs were attacking. Everyone immediately put down their bowls and joined the fight against the thugs. In no time, more than 2,000 thugs surrounded the Chinese Embassy. They howled like wild beasts, shouting anti-China slogans and cursing our great leader Chairman Mao, throwing stones and torches into the embassy compound.

The frenzied Burmese fascist thugs had been causing trouble in front of the embassy for more than an hour. The embassy was filled with the sound of stones hitting and glass shattering, and the courtyard was littered with stones and glass fragments. However, the thugs' attempt to break into the embassy through the front gate failed. So, more than 2,000 thugs, with the help of the Ne Win reactionary army, changed their tactic and launched a concentrated attack on the back courtyard of the embassy. These fascist bandits had planned so meticulously. They placed ladders against the wall to climb up; they also prepared planks in advance, laying them over the iron wire fence on the embassy wall, and placing them on the iron framework of the water tower inside the courtyard, ready to climb in batches. The thugs outside the wall cheered them on. In an instant, about 30 to 40 thugs had climbed onto the wall. Each of them held daggers, short swords, axes, or iron bars, ready to commit murder; some held Burmese flags and bamboo poles, ready to tear down our Five-Star Red Flag; others carried gasoline cans and torches, ready to set fire to our embassy. The reactionary arrogance of the thugs reached its peak. The situation was serious. But the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were fearless and ready to give the invaders a crushing blow. At this time, Comrade Liu Yi and three other comrades were guarding the back courtyard. They picked up the stones thrown by the thugs and threw them back. Meanwhile, the five comrades who were preparing to defend the flag and guard the front gate rushed over as soon as they heard the news. They sternly warned the thugs to retreat immediately.

However, the bloodthirsty thugs, ignoring our warnings, rushed into the embassy compound. A fierce battle ensued. Comrade Liu Yi took the lead and charged forward. The first thug's foot had just touched the ground when he was grabbed by Comrade Liu Yi. At this moment, the thug on the wall, taking advantage of his high position, stabbed Comrade Liu Yi in the back of the ear with a sharpened stick. The broken tip of the stick, more than two inches long, was embedded in Comrade Liu Yi's flesh. Comrade Liu Yi, ignoring the intense pain, continued to struggle with the thugs. His waist, back, and face were stabbed eight more times. However, this steadfast proletarian revolutionary warrior, with the spirit of fighting to the death with the enemies of the Chinese nation, still tightly held onto the enemy and rolled on the ground with him. Other comrades immediately turned around and beat up this murderous fascist executioner. The thug, badly injured, howled like a wolf and fled. Two other thugs who jumped into the embassy compound were also beaten up by our comrades, who fled in panic, leaving behind a trail of blood. Four thugs jumped down, and three were injured by us, fleeing with wounds all over their bodies. Our comrades' fearless struggle disrupted the enemy's formation and crushed their arrogance. These brutal enemies were also the most cowardly. They dared not jump down anymore; they were terrified. At this time, the Ne Win reactionary army outside the embassy, seeing that the thugs they supported had suffered a setback, fired shots into the air, signaling the thugs to retreat! Just as the thugs were retreating in panic, the fourth thug did not have time to turn back. Our red messenger, Comrade Cao Dalin, quickly rushed forward to intercept him. This thug was actually a fascist soldier in disguise, wearing civilian clothes. He waved his dagger and stabbed Comrade Cao Dalin in the face. Comrade Cao Dalin twisted the thug's hand holding the dagger and struggled with him. At this moment, another comrade rushed forward, swung a club, and struck the fascist soldier thug's head, snatched the dagger, and rescued Comrade Cao Dalin. Seeing the situation was bad, the soldier thug tried to escape by climbing over the wall. But he could not escape; our comrades chased after him. In front of our heroes, the thug knelt down with his hands raised, trembling all over, and was captured alive.

A thrilling and fierce battle against the thugs ended in victory. It once again demonstrated to the world that the diplomatic warriors of the new China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are forever loyal to the great motherland, forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. No reactionary forces in the world can defeat them!

During the intense struggle against the enemy, comrades rushed to rescue Liu Yi. Messenger Zhang Ruijun rushed to the side of Comrade Liu Yi, who was lying in a pool of blood. However, Comrade Liu Yi stood up firmly, his blood soaking his clothes and dripping onto the embassy's soil. What a strong and resolute warrior of Chairman Mao! Ignoring the bleeding and intense pain, he said firmly, "I can walk by myself." Comrades helped him into the house and lay him down, shedding tears as they tried every means to save their good comrade. However, our dear Comrade Liu Yi, to defend the dignity of the motherland and the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, finally succumbed to his fatal injuries and excessive bleeding and sacrificed his young life in the international class struggle!

The Ne Win reactionary government murdered a Chinese expert who was aiding Burma inside the Chinese Embassy in Burma. This shows that it is the most barbaric, most brutal, and most shameless fascist clique!

Comrade Liu Yi, who came from a poor peasant family and had been an apprentice worker, was brought a happy new life by the great leader Chairman Mao, and it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured him to grow up. The Party sent him to study at a speeded-up middle school and university for workers and peasants, and through various political movements, he was tempered into a young Communist Party member who firmly upholds the truth and has a clear stand. As early as 1962, Comrade Liu Yi opposed the "tool of domestication" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev and opposed the distribution of his black "Study Notes on Self-Cultivation" among Party members.

After the great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Liu Yi, with great enthusiasm, joined the struggle to expose the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road and resolutely resisted the conspiracy to attack the revolutionary masses. In a big-character poster, he declared proudly, "My head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but I will fight to the death for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." He enthusiastically participated in the work of receiving the Red Guards. When the great leader Chairman Mao received the Red Guards, Comrade Liu Yi let a little Red Guard sit on his shoulders, so he could see our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, clearly.

On April 30 this year, Comrade Liu Yi bid farewell to his wife, whom he had married only ten days earlier, and went to Burma to work with the Chinese expert group. When Comrade Liu Yi first arrived in Yangon, he saw the Five-Star Red Flag flying over the embassy and had expressed to his comrades: He would definitely learn from Comrade Zhao Xiaoshu, the red diplomat of Chairman Mao, and no matter what storms and waves he encountered, he would defend the dignity of the motherland with his blood and life.

In the more than a month that Comrade Liu Yi worked in Burma, he enthusiastically promoted Mao Zedong Thought and served the Burmese working people with deep class feelings, setting another shining example of "never seeking personal gain but always seeking the gain of others." On May 18, he walked more than 40 li to the work area, covered in dust from the mountain road, and immediately threw himself into the work. He carried two golden copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," one in Chinese and one in English, and read them aloud every morning without fail. The work site was in a remote mountain area, and the work location was a gorge between two steep hills. The living place was a cave halfway up the mountain. The mountain was steep and covered with thorns, and one misstep could be fatal. Before going to work every day, Comrade Liu Yi and other members of the expert group would recite Chairman Mao's words: "To struggle is to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is to die a worthy death."

Under the reactionary rule of the Ne Win government, the Burmese working people were starving. Comrade Liu Yi shared the fate and breath of his class brothers in Burma who were suffering from disasters. Comrade Liu Yi and other members of the expert group would set aside half of their rice for Burmese workers every time they ate. In his busy work, Comrade Liu Yi also helped the Burmese cook carry water every day. It was inconvenient to get water in the mountains, and one had to climb a steep and bumpy slope. Besides taking the initiative to carry water, Comrade Liu Yi would also bring a bucket of water back when he went down the mountain to wash his face, never going empty-handed. The Burmese cook said, "The Chinese experts are really great, not only are they humble, but they also help the cooks with their work, which is really touching!" This cook asked for a Chairman Mao badge to wear on his chest. When the expert group left the work site, he rushed to the station to see them off, reluctant to part, repeatedly shouting in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Comrade Liu Yi, with his model deeds, added luster to the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma and to the socialist motherland.

Comrade Liu Yi died a heroic death. His glorious image will forever live in our hearts. Dear Comrade Liu Yi! You are a good son of the Chinese people, a good Party member of the Communist Party of China. You are a great internationalist warrior and a resolute proletarian revolutionary rebel. Your blood will not be shed in vain. The blood debt owed by the Ne Win reactionary government will definitely be repaid!

    毛主席的红色援外战士——刘逸
    在闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的世界革命的伟大新时代中，在我国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，又一位英雄人物的名字载入了国际无产阶级革命斗争的史册！
    这是一位伟大的国际主义战士；这是一位中国红色援外战士；他就是值得我们永远学习的好榜样——刘逸烈士！
    六月二十八日，奈温反动政府组织暴徒疯狂袭击中国驻缅甸大使馆。我们的刘逸同志是同暴徒作殊死搏斗中英勇牺牲的。他用自己的鲜血和生命捍卫了伟大祖国的尊严，增强了中缅两国人民之间的友谊，给美帝、苏修和缅甸反动派以沉重的打击！他是为人民的利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的！
    六月下旬的仰光，缅甸法西斯暴徒到处横行霸道，一片白色恐怖。那时候，缅甸反动军警指挥着暴徒，在仰光的大街小巷，对无限热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席的爱国华侨进行惨绝人寰的大屠杀、大逮捕、大洗劫、大焚烧。中国大使馆和其他驻缅机构多次被袭击，建筑物的玻璃窗被砸碎，使馆大门的支柱都被暴徒砸弯了。奈温反动政府用疯狂反华的罪恶行动，撕破了它所标榜的“积极中立”、“缅中友好”的假面具。刘逸同志就是在这残酷的阶级斗争形势下，从援缅工地返回大使馆的。
    奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行激起了刘逸同志无比的阶级仇恨。他在二十六日深夜写的一封家信，显示了英雄内心无私、无畏、高尚、纯粹的精神境界。他在信中说：“缅甸反动政府蓄意恶化两国关系，一切后果就可想而知了。我们每个同志都作了思想准备，……誓与反动派斗到底。”他说：“告诉爸爸妈妈不要为我担心。我们和使馆工作人员在国外，人数虽比不上特务暴徒多，但我们有祖国七亿人民作靠山，有毛泽东思想为武器，我们的力量全无敌！”
    二十八日凌晨，刘逸刚到使馆就同大家一起进行抗击暴徒的准备工作。他把对敌人的无比仇恨，贯注在每一件工作上。他越想到受难的侨胞，越想到毛主席的教导：“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”他干活的劲头就越大，整整干了一上午的重活，也没有休息。
    下午一点左右，我们的同志正在吃午饭。突然，反华的嘶叫声由远而近地传来。这是暴徒来袭的信号。大家立即放下饭碗投入抗暴斗争。不一会，二千多名暴徒就把中国大使馆包围了。他们象发狂的野兽一样吼叫着反华和辱骂我们伟大领袖毛主席的口号，疯狂地向使馆院内投掷石块，扔进火把。
    发了疯的缅甸法西斯暴徒们一直在大使馆门前为非作歹达一个多小时。大使馆内一直响着乒乓的石块声和窗户被砸玻璃落地声，满院都是石块和玻璃碎片。但是，暴徒们妄图从正门冲进使馆的企图失败了。于是，二千多暴徒在奈温反动军队的帮助下，改为重点向使馆后院猛冲。这群法西斯匪徒们计划得如此周密，他们把梯子横到墙上向上爬；又把早已准备好的跳板，横过使馆院墙上的铁丝网，搭在院内靠近围墙的水塔铁架上，然后成批地往上冲。群集在墙外的暴徒则发出狂叫，为他们助威。霎那间，已有三、四十名暴徒爬到院墙上来了。他们个个手里拿着匕首、短刀、斧头或铁棍，这是准备来行凶杀人的；有的拿着缅甸国旗和竹竿，这是企图扯下我们的五星红旗的；有的手提汽油桶和火把，这是准备纵火焚烧我大使馆的。暴徒们的反动气焰达到了登峰造极的程度。情况是严重的。但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国优秀儿女，不畏强暴，严阵以待，准备给来犯者以迎头痛击。这时，刘逸同志和其他三位同志一直坚守在后院。他们拣起暴徒扔来的石块，向敌人还击。另外，在准备护旗和坚守大门口的五位同志闻讯后也立即赶了过来。他们严词警告暴徒们，必须立即退回去。
    但是，嗜血成性的暴徒们，不顾我们的警告，悍然向使馆院内冲下来，于是一场空前激烈的搏斗展开了。刘逸同志奋勇当先，冲了过去。第一个暴徒的一只脚刚刚落地，就被刘逸同志抱住了。这时，站在墙上的暴徒，利用居高临下的地势，用削尖了的木棍刺入刘逸同志的耳后，二寸多长的棍尖断在刘逸同志的肌肉里。刘逸同志忘记了剧痛，继续同暴徒们肉搏。他的腰部、背部、脸部又被暴徒刺了八刀。然而，这位坚强的无产阶级革命战士，有着同中华民族的敌人血战到底的气概，他仍然紧紧揪住敌人不放，和暴徒一起在地上翻滚。其他同志马上转过来，狠命地揍这个杀人的法西斯刽子手。这个暴徒受了重伤以后，狼嚎犬吠似地逃了出去。另外两个暴徒刚跳进使馆院内，就遭到我们的同志痛打，打得他们连滚带爬，仓皇而逃。敌人跳下来四名，就被我们打伤了三名，带着满身伤痕逃回去了。我们同志不畏强暴的英勇斗争，打乱了敌人的阵脚，挫败了敌人的气焰。这些残暴的敌人也是最怕死的，他们不敢再往下跳，他们胆怯了。这时，在使馆外面的奈温反动军队，看到被他们支持的暴徒吃了亏，于是，他们对着天空鸣枪，发出了指使暴徒撤退的信号！就在暴徒仓皇撤退的时候，第四名暴徒，来不及后转。我们的红色信使曹达林同志迅速迎击上去。这个暴徒原是脱去了军装伪装成平民的法西斯军人。他挥动着匕首，一下子刺伤了曹达林同志的脸部。曹达林同志扭着了敌人拿匕首的手同他搏斗。这时，我们的另一位同志赶上前来，抡起木棒，狠击这个法西斯军人暴徒的头部，夺下匕首，救出曹达林同志。这个军人暴徒一见大势不妙，撒腿就跑，企图翻墙而逃。但他跑不掉了，我们的同志们一齐追赶上去。在我们的英雄面前，这个暴徒两腿一跪，双手高举，浑身发抖，被活活捉住。
    一场惊心动魄、残酷激烈的抗暴斗争胜利了。它再一次向全世界表明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国的外交战士，永远忠于伟大的祖国，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，世界上没有任何反动力量可以战胜他们！
    在同敌人进行殊死搏斗的紧张时刻，同志们分出力量去抢救刘逸。信使张瑞琏扑到躺在血泊里的刘逸同志身边。但是，刘逸同志却毅然站起来了，鲜血浸透他的衣衫，顺着衣角滴到使馆的土地上。多么坚强而刚毅的毛主席的好战士啊！他不顾鲜血直流，剧痛煎熬，刚强地说：“我自己能走。”同志们把他扶到屋子里躺下，含着眼泪，想尽一切办法抢救自己的好战友。但是，我们亲爱的刘逸同志，为了维护祖国的尊严，为了中缅两国人民的友谊，终因伤中要害，流血过多，在国际阶级斗争中，贡献出了他年轻的生命！
    奈温反动政府把一位援助缅甸的中国专家惨杀在中国驻缅使馆里，这说明它是一个最野蛮、最残暴、最无耻的法西斯集团！
    刘逸同志这个出身贫农家庭作过学徒工的苦孩子，是伟大领袖毛主席给他带来了幸福的新生活，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育他成长起来的。党把他保送到工农速成中学和大学里读书，历次政治运动把他锻炼成为一个坚持真理、旗帜鲜明的青年共产党员。早在一九六二年，刘逸同志就反对中国赫鲁晓夫的“驯服工具论”，反对在党员中散发他的黑《修养》。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈展开后，刘逸同志以极大热情，投入揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，坚决抵制围攻革命群众的阴谋。他在一张大字报中豪迈地说，头可断，血可流，誓为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线冲锋陷阵。他满腔热情地参加了接待红卫兵小将的工作。在伟大领袖毛主席接见红卫兵时，刘逸同志让一个小红卫兵坐在自己肩上，使他清楚地看到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    今年四月三十日，刘逸同志离别了新婚十天的妻子，随同我国专家组前往缅甸工作。刘逸同志在刚到仰光的时候，看到使馆上空飘扬的五星红旗时，就曾经向战友表示：一定要向毛主席的红色外交战士赵小寿学习，不管碰到什么险风恶浪，都要以鲜血和生命来捍卫祖国的尊严。
    刘逸同志在缅甸工作的一个多月里，以最大的热情宣传毛泽东思想，以极其深厚的阶级感情为缅甸劳动人民服务，是又一个“毫不利己专门利人”的光辉榜样。五月十八日，他步行四十多里来到工区，披着满身山路的风尘，立即投入了工作。他随身带着两本金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，一本中文的和一本英文的，每天早晨都要大声朗读，坚持不懈。工地在一个荒僻的山区，劳动地点是两个陡峭山岭之间的峡谷，住的地方是半山腰的一个山洞。山势很陡，布满荆棘，一脚踏空，就有生命危险。每天上工之前，刘逸同志就和专家组其他成员一起，背诵毛主席语录：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    在奈温政府的反动统治下，缅甸劳动人民食不果腹。刘逸同志和灾难深重的缅甸阶级兄弟，同命运，共呼吸。刘逸同志和专家组其他成员每次吃饭的时候，就分出一半米饭给缅甸民工。刘逸同志在繁忙的工作之余，每天还帮助缅甸厨师提水。山区取水不便，要爬一段坎坷的陡坡。刘逸同志除了主动去提水之外，就是下山洗脸，也总是带一桶水回来，从未空手过。缅甸厨师说：“中国专家实在太好了，不要说没有架子，还帮助伙伕干活，真是感人！”这位厨师要了毛主席像章佩在胸前。当专家组离开工地时，他赶往车站送行，依依不舍，一再用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”刘逸同志以他的模范事迹，为中缅两国人民的友谊，为社会主义祖国增添了光辉。
    刘逸同志壮烈牺牲了。他的光辉形象将永远活在我们的心里。亲爱的刘逸同志！你是中国人民的好儿子，中国共产党的好党员。你是伟大的国际主义战士，是坚定的无产阶级革命造反派。你的鲜血决不会白流。奈温反动政府欠下的这笔血债，是一定要偿还的！
