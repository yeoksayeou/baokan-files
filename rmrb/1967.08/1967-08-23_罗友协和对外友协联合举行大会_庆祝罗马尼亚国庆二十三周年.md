The Sino-Romanian Friendship Association and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade jointly held a meeting today to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of Romania's National Day. Vice Premier Li Xiannian, responsible officials from relevant departments, and over a thousand people from various sectors of the capital attended the celebration.

Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Chu Tu-nan, and Romanian Ambassador to China, Orel Dumitru, both spoke at the meeting.

Chu Tu-nan, in his speech, extended greetings to the Romanian people on their national day. He said that the long-term armed struggle of the Chinese people and the armed uprising of the Romanian people in 1944, as well as the struggles of other peoples, repeatedly proved the great truth proposed by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Chu Tu-nan said that the friendship between the peoples of China and Romania fully meets the wishes and fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries. He expressed his belief that the friendship between the two peoples will be further consolidated and developed in the future.

Chu Tu-nan said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories. It has shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism to restore capitalism in our country, greatly strengthened our proletarian dictatorship, and greatly encouraged and inspired the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the world's proletariat and revolutionary people.

Ambassador Orel Dumitru, in his speech, introduced the armed uprising and construction of the Romanian people. He pointed out that in recent years, the cooperative relations between the Romanian people and the Chinese people in all fields have been continuously developed, and this relationship is in the interests of the peoples of the two countries. The ambassador wished the Chinese people greater achievements in socialist construction.

To celebrate Romania's National Day, the Foreign Cultural Relations Committee and other units held a film screening on the 21st.
