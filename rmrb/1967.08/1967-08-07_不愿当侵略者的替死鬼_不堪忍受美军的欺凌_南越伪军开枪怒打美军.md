The U.S. aggressor forces, due to their severe defeats in the Vietnam War, have brutally forced the puppet army of South Vietnam to be their vanguard and cannon fodder. This has further intensified the sharp contradictions between the puppet army and the U.S. aggressors.

When the Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Marine Corps south of the demilitarized zone in late May this year, the soldiers of the 5th and 6th regiments of the puppet army stationed in the Bien Hoa area refused to obey the U.S. aggressors' order to be sent to the south of the demilitarized zone to rescue the U.S. Marine Corps. They also burned over 1,300 marching bags to protest against the U.S. aggressors' attempt to use them as cannon fodder. On June 15, the U.S. aggressors sent many troops to try to force them onto planes to go to the south of the demilitarized zone. The soldiers of the puppet army, unable to bear it any longer, opened fire and killed and wounded many U.S. aggressors. They also blew up an ammunition depot in the camp.

The U.S. aggressors' acts of arson, looting, and oppression and bullying of the puppet army have aroused the indignation and resistance of the soldiers of the puppet army. On April 12 this year, the U.S. aggressors in the northern part of Quang Tri Province, in order to expand their military base, sent a large number of troops to forcibly relocate local residents and used bulldozers to level their houses. The soldiers of the 2nd Company of a certain regiment of the 1st Division of the puppet army stationed in the area, unable to bear it any longer, opened fire and attacked a squad of U.S. engineers, wounding many of them.

    不愿当侵略者的替死鬼　不堪忍受美军的欺凌
    南越伪军开枪怒打美军
    据新华社河内六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美国侵略军由于在侵越战争中遭到惨败，横暴地迫使南越伪军为他们打头阵送死，使南越伪军和美国侵略军之间的尖锐矛盾进一步激化。
    在今年五月底解放武装力量在非军事区以南痛击美国海军陆战队的时候，驻边和地区的南越伪军第五团和第六团的广大士兵拒绝了美国侵略军把他们派往非军事区以南地区去救援美国海军陆战队的命令。他们还烧掉了一千三百多个行军袋，表示对美国侵略军要他们去充当炮灰的抗议。美国侵略军在六月十五日派出了很多部队，企图用武力迫使他们上飞机到非军事区以南地区去。广大伪军士兵忍无可忍，开枪打死打伤了很多美国侵略军。他们还炸毁了军营里的一个弹药库。
    美国侵略军的烧杀抢掠和对伪军的压迫欺凌，引起了伪军广大士兵的愤慨和反抗。今年四月十二日，驻在广治省北部的美国侵略军为了扩建军事基地，派出大批部队强迫当地居民外迁，并且用推土机夷平居民的房屋。驻在当地的伪军第一师某部二连的广大士兵忍无可忍，开枪袭击了一队美国工兵，打伤了很多人。
