Behind "entertainment" and "rest"

Counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhang Geng, with his smooth and pleasant tone, falsely claims that "if a play has little educational value but does no harm, it can provide the audience with refined entertainment, which is also good. This way, it serves the people and serves socialism."

Anyone with a keen eye can see that this is nothing new. It is merely a rehash of the reactionary viewpoint advocated by China's Khrushchev, who promoted the idea of "letting people watch plays to rest well, thereby encouraging enthusiasm for socialist labor."

What are the so-called items that can provide "entertainment" and "rest" as promoted by them? Upon investigation, it turns out that these are all feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist junk. These items, which reflect the reactionary and decadent thoughts of the landlord and bourgeoisie, how can they "provide the audience with refined entertainment" and "encourage enthusiasm for socialist labor"? On the contrary, they are opium that erodes the revolutionary will of the people and corrupts the souls of the revolutionary masses.

In fact, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhang Geng never watch or perform plays for the sake of "entertainment" and "rest." Instead, they are engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

Anti-party element Zhou Xinfan performs old and bad plays on stage. Zhang Geng, who claims to be tired of watching plays, becomes "excited and unable to sleep" after each performance. He cannot "suppress his emotions, and tears well up in his eyes." What is it that makes him "feel his heartstrings tremble" after watching? As Zhang Geng himself feels: it is Zhou Xinfan's "attitude towards reality and politics."

One fully engages in anti-party activities on stage, and the other is so moved on the sidelines that he cannot "suppress his emotions." They are truly kindred spirits, breathing in unison! How is this "entertainment" and "rest"?

The theater is a battlefield of ideological struggle. Zhang Geng and his ilk, with their counter-revolutionary nature, deeply understand this. He loudly advocates that those who are "unfortunate" in life should go to the theater to "relieve their boredom," be moved, shed some tears, and then feel "lightened" and gain "confidence in life."

This is a self-incriminating confession. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, only a small clique of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, as well as bourgeois elements, feel "bored" with socialist reality. They can feel "lightened" and "moved" by anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, and they need to strengthen their "confidence" in overthrowing the socialist system from such poisonous weeds.

It is clear that "entertainment" and "rest" are just pretexts. Behind them lies the counter-revolutionary plot to use old plays to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and achieve a capitalist restoration.

    在“娱乐”“休息”的背后
    江碧
    反革命修正主义分子张庚，操着娓娓动听的腔调，胡说什么“如果演的戏，教育意义虽然不大，但无害处，可以使观众得到高尚娱乐，这也很好，……也就达到为人民服务，为社会主义服务的目的了”。
    明眼人一看就知道，这不是什么新鲜的货色，不过是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的所谓“让大家看了戏，好好休息，就是鼓励社会主义劳动热情”的反动观点的翻版而已！
    被他们宣扬的所谓能起“娱乐”“休息”作用的东西是些什么货色呢？
    一查剧目，原来都是些封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货。这些表现地主资产阶级反动腐朽思想的东西，怎么能“使观众得到高尚娱乐”，“鼓励社会主义劳动热情”？恰恰相反，它们是消磨人民的革命意志，腐蚀革命群众灵魂的鸦片剂。
    其实，象张庚之流的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，他们看戏、演戏，从不是在于“娱乐”、“休息”，而是在干反革命的勾当。
    反党分子周信芳，在舞台上大演旧戏、坏戏。自命为看戏看疲了的张庚，“每次看完回家”，却为之“兴奋得不能入睡”，“抑制不住感情，甚至泪水都在眼眶中转动起来”。是什么东西使他“看后感到心弦震动不已”呢？用张庚的切身感受来说：就是周信芳“对待现实，对待政治的态度”。
    一个在舞台上全身心地反党，一个在台下被激动得“抑制不住感情”，真是心心相印，一个鼻孔出气呵！这怎么是在“娱乐”“休息”呢？
    剧场本来就是阶级斗争的一个思想阵地。张庚等凭着他的反革命本性，是深深懂得其中的奥妙的。他大声疾呼，要那些在生活中“不幸”的人到“剧场中来解解闷气”，受受感动，流流眼泪，然后心里“轻松起来”，增长“对生活的信心”。
    这是不打自招的供状。在无产阶级专政下，只有那一小撮地富反坏和资产阶级分子，才对社会主义的现实感到“闷气”，才能从反党反社会主义的毒草中感到“轻松”，得到“感动”，也才需要从这种大毒草中增强推翻社会主义制度的“信心”。
    由此可见，所谓“娱乐”、“休息”不过是幌子。在此背后，却包藏着利用旧戏剧来颠覆无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟的反革命祸心。
