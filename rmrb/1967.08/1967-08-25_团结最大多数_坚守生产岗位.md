The call to "grasp revolution and promote production" is a great directive from Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers must implement it without any compromise and strive to be models in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to revolutionize people's thinking and make all work better, faster, and more efficient. Many revolutionary factions in various places have a sense of the bigger picture, understand the broader context, and prioritize the interests of the state and the working class. They have made outstanding achievements at their respective posts.

Currently, it is a crucial moment in the decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. We must adhere to "revolution on the spot, part-time revolution, and frugal revolution" and consciously observe the labor discipline of the proletariat. Those who insist on production should be praised and encouraged, so that all revolutionary workers can further boost their revolutionary spirit and complete the state plan quickly, efficiently, and economically.

Our workshop, following the great production victory in June, achieved another brilliant success in July, exceeding the state's task by 13 percent and setting a new record for both quantity and quality of products since the factory's establishment.

In the process of "grasping revolution and promoting production," the proletarian revolutionary faction in our workshop has played a crucial role. Our workshop has five leaders from revolutionary mass organizations, all of whom can firmly hold their posts during production hours. Some are also champions of production. For example, the workshop leader, Comrade Liu, is a pioneer in exposing the capitalist-roaders within the Party. He grasps revolution in his spare time and does not relax on production. He consistently exceeds his work hours and breaks production quotas. The original quota for grinding one machine bed was 50 hours, but now Comrade Liu finds ways to improve labor productivity and completes the task in just 16 hours. During the period when the capitalist-roaders within the Party ruled the factory, only one machine could be assembled in eight hours, but now Comrade Liu, with the help of an apprentice, has assembled four machines.

We do not discriminate against or attack those who have been misled. Following the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," we patiently guide them to "grasp revolution and promote production." This is also an important factor in our workshop's continuous production improvements. A worker in the final assembly group made a mistake in choosing sides during the movement and carried a heavy burden. One day, he did not come to work. After work, revolutionary comrades from the workshop went to his home to have a heart-to-heart talk and study Chairman Mao's works with him. Later, they mobilized him to participate in the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. These activities deeply moved this misled comrade. Once, the group accepted a relatively arduous production task, and he voluntarily took it on, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and finally completed the task. Among the misled masses, some are production group leaders. With the help of revolutionary comrades, they recognized their mistakes. The proletarian revolutionary faction then encouraged them to boldly promote production and called on the revolutionary masses to support the production group leaders' correct opinions. This has promoted production and ensured the completion of the state plan.

    团结最大多数　坚守生产岗位
    “抓革命，促生产”，是毛主席的伟大号召。无产阶级革命派和革命职工一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行，力争成为抓革命、促生产的模范。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要促使人的思想革命化，使各项工作做得更多更快更好更省。很多地方的革命派，顾大局，识大体，把国家利益、工人阶级利益放在第一位，在各自岗位上作出了卓越成绩。
    当前，正是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻。我们一定要坚持“就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命”，自觉地遵守无产阶级的劳动纪律。对坚持生产的职工，应当给予表扬和鼓励，使全体革命职工，进一步鼓足革命干劲，多快好省地完成国家计划。
                      ——编者
      我们车间，继六月份生产大捷之后，七月份又打了一场漂亮仗，超额百分之十三完成了国家任务，创造了建厂以来产品数量、质量的最高水平。
    在“抓革命，促生产”中，我们车间无产阶级革命派发挥了重要作用。我们车间有五个革命群众组织的负责人，他们都能做到在生产时间坚守岗位，有的还是促生产的能手。例如车间负责人刘师傅，是揭露党内走资本主义道路当权派的闯将。他在业余时间抓革命，在生产上不放松，月月超工时，破定额。原规定刮研一台机床床身定额工时为五十小时，现在刘师傅找窍门提高劳动生产率，只用十六小时就完成了任务。在党内走资本主义道路当权派统治工厂期间，八小时只能装配一台机床，现在刘师傅带着一名学徒工，就装配了四台。
    对受蒙蔽的群众不歧视，不打击，本着团结——批评——团结的公式，耐心引导他们“抓革命，促生产”，这也是我们车间生产蒸蒸日上的重要因素。总装组一位群众，在运动中站错了队，思想负担很重。有一天他没有上班，下班后车间革命派同志亲自到他家去谈心，同他一起学习毛主席著作，后来又动员他一起参加斗批党内走资本主义道路当权派，这些活动使这位受蒙蔽的同志深受感动。有一次组里接受了一个比较艰巨的生产任务，他主动承担下来，不怕苦，不怕累，终于完成了任务。在受蒙蔽的群众中，有一部分是车间生产组长。在革命派同志的帮助下，他们认识了错误。无产阶级革命派就鼓励他们大胆抓好生产，并且号召革命群众支持生产组长正确的意见。这样就促进了生产，保证了国家计划的完成。
