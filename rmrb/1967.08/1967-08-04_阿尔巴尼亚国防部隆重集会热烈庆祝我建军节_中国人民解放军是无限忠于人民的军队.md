The Albanian Ministry of National Defense held a grand meeting in the People's Assembly Hall on the afternoon of July 30 to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The meeting was presided over by Hito Chako, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army.

Dilaver Boci, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Deputy Director of the Political Department of the People's Army, and Li Yifan, the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, both gave speeches at the meeting. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic, prolonged applause, slogans, and cheers. The entire audience stood and cheered dozens of times, enthusiastically shouting: "Enver—Mao Zedong!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live Comrade Hoxha!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!"

Boci said in his speech that the fraternal Chinese People's Liberation Army was established and educated by the glorious Communist Party of China and the great leader and theoretician of the people's revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong, during the darkest and most difficult days of the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of the Chinese people's revolution, creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, and pointed out the correct path for the people's revolutionary war in China.

Boci said that today, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful backbone and defender of the oppressed peoples of the world, an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialists led by the United States, the Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries.

Boci said that the glorious revolutionary army of China is a powerful weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat under the leadership of the Party, a military force that is loyal to the interests of the people, a defender and promoter of the socialist revolution. It is infinitely loyal to the people, the motherland, the Party, and Chairman Mao. With such an army, the banner of revolution, socialism, and communism will forever fly high. This is a great encouragement and support to the people who are still under imperialist colonial rule.

Boci concluded by saying that the Albanian Labor Party, people, and army have a friend who shares life and death with them—the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong. The increasingly developed and consolidated fraternal and close relations and internationalist friendship between our two peoples, parties, and armies are a shining example for the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Li Yifan, the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, then spoke at the meeting, saying that the 40-year history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army tells us that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee of our army's victories, that Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is the most effective weapon for our army to defeat powerful enemies, and that Chairman Mao's military line and principles are the soul of all our work. Our army resolutely responds to Comrade Lin Biao's call to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Li Yifan highly praised the heroic Albanian people and their army, who, under the correct leadership of the glorious Labor Party and its great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, have raised the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and have been fighting resolutely against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and against the modern revisionist traitors and scoundrels centered around the Soviet revisionists. He also praised their great contributions to the world people's revolutionary cause and the international communist movement.

At the meeting, Li Yifan also, on behalf of the General Staff and General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, presented 200 sets of Mao badges and "Serve the People" badges worn by all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to their closest comrades-in-arms, the Albanian People's Army.

Among those attending the celebration were Perlak, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Dum, Vice Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, and more than 600 soldiers and family members of the Tirana garrison. Chinese Ambassador to Albania Liu Xiao was also invited to attend the meeting.

    阿尔巴尼亚国防部隆重集会热烈庆祝我建军节
    中国人民解放军是无限忠于人民的军队
    据新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚国防部七月三十日下午在人民议会大厅举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十周年。庆祝会由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科主持。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、人民军政治部副主任迪拉维尔·波奇和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆武官李一凡先后在会上讲了话。他们的讲话不断为热烈的经久不息的掌声、口号声和欢呼声所打断。全场起立欢呼数十次，热情高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东同志万岁！”“霍查同志万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”
    波奇在讲话中说，兄弟的中国人民解放军是在中国人民最黑暗、最困难的日子里，由光荣的中国共产党和伟大的人民革命领袖和理论家毛泽东主席所创立和教育出来的。毛泽东同志总结了中国人民革命的经验，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，指出了在中国开展人民革命战争的正确道路。
    波奇说，今天，中华人民共和国已经成为世界被压迫人民的强大后盾和捍卫者，成为以美国为首的帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和一切反动派所不可逾越的障碍。
    波奇说，光荣的中国革命军队是掌握在党的手里的无产阶级专政的强大武器，是忠实于人民利益的军队，是社会主义革命的保卫者和推进者。她无限忠于人民、祖国、党和毛泽东主席。有了这样一支军队，革命的旗帜，社会主义和共产主义的旗帜将永远高高飘扬。这永远是对仍处在帝国主义殖民统治下的人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。
    波奇最后说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、人民和军队有着生死与共的朋友——中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东同志。我们两国人民、两党和两军之间日益发展和巩固的兄弟般的亲密关系和国际主义友谊，是全世界革命人民的光辉典范。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚使馆武官李一凡接着在会上讲话说，中国人民解放军四十年的历史告诉我们：毛泽东思想是我军取得胜利的根本保证，毛主席关于人民战争的理论是我军战胜强大敌人的最有效的法宝，毛主席的建军路线和建军原则是我军一切工作的灵魂。我军坚决响应林彪同志的号召，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    李一凡高度赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民及其军队在光荣的劳动党及其伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的正确领导下，高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义革命旗帜，同美帝国主义及其走狗，同以苏修领导为中心的现代修正主义叛徒工贼集团进行的坚决斗争，以及对世界人民革命事业和国际共产主义运动作出的巨大贡献。
    会上，李一凡还代表中国人民解放军总参谋部和总政治部，把中国人民解放军全体指战员佩带的毛主席像章和“为人民服务”章两百套赠送给最亲密的战友——阿尔巴尼亚人民军。
    出席庆祝会的还有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员佩尔拉库、阿中友协副主席杜米，以及地拉那卫戍部队指战员及其家属等六百多人。中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓也应邀出席了大会。
