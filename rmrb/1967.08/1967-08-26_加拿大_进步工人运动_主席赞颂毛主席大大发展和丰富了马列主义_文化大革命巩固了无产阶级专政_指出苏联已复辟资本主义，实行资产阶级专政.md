	New China News Agency, August 25th: The chairman of the central committee of the Canadian "Progressive Workers' Movement," Jack Scott, recently published an article in the monthly journal "Progressive Worker," enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao for developing Marxism-Leninism and praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao.

	Scott, who visited China in May this year, wrote in his article titled "New Developments in China" that Chairman Mao has greatly developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism.

	The article states that based on the experiences and lessons of the Chinese revolution and the world revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao has elucidated the issues of class contradictions and class struggle in socialist society. He proposed that after the proletariat seizes power, it must carry out a revolution in the ideological and cultural fields to resolve the question of who will prevail in the realm of ideology.

	The article states that after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie continues in the form of a struggle for power. A handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party are agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party. These people, using their usurped positions, launch attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to turn it into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

	The article points out that if a Marxist-Leninist ignores this fundamental issue of class struggle, he runs the risk of becoming a revisionist.

	The article points out that after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union failed to solve this problem, and as a result, the Soviet Union has returned to the capitalist road and now has a bourgeois dictatorship.

	The article points out that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are carrying out a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This struggle is to ensure the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship and the consolidation and development of socialist ownership. In China, the struggle between the two lines is the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line.

	The article states that the outcome of this struggle will determine China's future and will have a decisive influence on the world. Because, in contemporary times, it is China that is playing a truly decisive role in the world.

	The article concludes: "Now, the working people of all countries in the world are studying the works of Mao Zedong and hailing him as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our era. In the period of overthrowing imperialism and advancing socialism, it is Mao Zedong Thought that is guiding the revolutionary masses forward."

	According to the New China News Agency, Ottawa: The August issue of the organ of the Canadian "Progressive Workers' Movement," the monthly journal "Progressive Worker," published an article that highly praises Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The article points out that Chairman Mao's works and directives "constitute a milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism, marking the advent of a new era—the era of Mao Zedong Thought."

	The article states: "Chairman Mao Zedong has summed up the experiences of class struggle in socialist society and the experiences of proletarian dictatorship in various countries, particularly noting the lessons of the seizure of power by the Khrushchev revisionists within the Soviet Party and state, and has put forward theories and policies to prevent the Chinese Party and state from taking a similar path. Chairman Mao has expounded in a comprehensive, systematic, and scientific manner the theory of class and class contradictions in socialist society."

	The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is a profound revolution being carried out by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and it will certainly achieve victory.

    加拿大“进步工人运动”主席赞颂毛主席大大发展和丰富了马列主义
    文化大革命巩固了无产阶级专政
    指出苏联已复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政
    新华社二十五日讯　加拿大“进步工人运动”中央委员会主席杰克·斯科特最近在《进步工人》月刊上发表文章，热烈赞扬毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，赞扬毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    斯科特在今年五月曾应邀来中国访问。他在这篇题为《中国的新进展》的文章中指出，毛主席大大发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义。
    文章说，毛主席根据中国革命和世界革命运动的经验和教训，阐明了社会主义社会中阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的问题，提出了无产阶级在夺取政权以后，必须在思想战线和文化战线上进行一次革命，来解决思想意识领域里谁战胜谁的问题。
    文章说，无产阶级专政建立以后，无产阶级与资产阶级之间的斗争，仍然表现于争夺政权的斗争。一小撮混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，他们是资产阶级在党内的代理人。这些人利用他们窃踞的地位，向无产阶级专政发动进攻，妄图把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政。
    文章指出，如果一个马克思列宁主义者忽视了这个阶级斗争的基本问题，他就有变为修正主义者的危险。
    文章指出，在十月革命后苏联没有能解决这个问题，因而现在苏联回到了资本主义的道路上去，出现了资产阶级专政。
    文章指出，在毛主席的领导下，中国人民正在开展一场文化大革命。这场斗争就是为了保证无产阶级政权的巩固和社会主义所有制的巩固和发展。在中国的两条路线的斗争，就是毛主席的革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的斗争。
    文章说，这场斗争的结果，将决定中国未来的命运，并且对全世界发挥决定性的影响。因为就当代来说，正是中国在世界上起着真正的决定性的作用。
    文章最后说：“现在世界各国的劳动人民，都在学习毛泽东的著作，并且欢呼他是我们时代的最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。在打倒帝国主义和社会主义向前发展的时期中，正是毛泽东思想指引着革命群众前进。”
    据新华社讯　渥太华消息：加拿大“进步工人运动”机关刊物《进步工人》月刊八月号在一篇文章中，高度赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。文章指出，毛主席的著作和指示“构成了马克思列宁主义发展中的一个里程碑，它标志着马克思列宁主义的新纪元——毛泽东思想的纪元已经到来”。
    文章说：“毛泽东主席总结了社会主义社会阶级斗争的经验和世界各国无产阶级专政的经验，特别注意到苏联党和国家内的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者窃取权力的教训，提出了防止中国党和国家走类似的道路的理论和政策。毛主席以极全面、系统和科学的方式阐述了在社会主义社会中阶级和阶级矛盾的理论。”
    文章说，目前正在进行的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是中国共产党和中国人民正在进行的一场极为深刻的革命，一定会取得胜利。
