	“Snow presses down on winter clouds, white cotton flies.” The year 1962 was a time of intense and complex class struggle.
	At that time, the forces aiming to restore capitalism, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, launched a full-scale attack on the Party amidst a frenzy of anti-China propaganda both domestically and internationally. China's Khrushchev openly came out, attempting to rehabilitate the disgraced ambitious and conspiratorial counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai. He shouted: “Peng Dehuai's anti-party ‘opinion book’ is ‘not entirely incorrect’ and ‘does not constitute an error.’” He viciously attacked Chairman Mao's personally led struggle against the Peng Dehuai anti-party clique as an “erroneous and excessive struggle.” With the strong support and encouragement of China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, in June 1962, threw out an 80,000-word rehabilitation document. At the same time, China's Khrushchev, through his agents in various fields, colluded with a group of ghosts and snakes to produce a batch of poisonous weeds like “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” creating public opinion to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai and restore capitalism. The reactionary film “Angry Tide” was born in this whirlwind of dark clouds and evil winds.

	The reactionary film “Angry Tide,” originally titled “Pingjiang Angry Tide,” had its initial draft written under Peng Dehuai's instructions. Peng Dehuai once said: “The Pingjiang Uprising should be written well, I can provide the materials.” Peng Dehuai shamelessly added: “If you want to write about me, you can write: brave in fighting the enemy, a brave son of a peasant.” The main screenwriter of this film was a key figure in Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique. He understood the hint and began writing the film script in 1958, openly erecting a monument to Peng Dehuai.

	In August 1959, the Lushan Conference thundered, removing the anti-party element Peng Dehuai from office. His henchmen were momentarily flustered. After regaining their composure, they frantically worked to summon the spirit of their master. On one hand, they wrote “The History of the Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle” and established the “Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle Exhibition Hall” to sing the praises of Peng Dehuai; on the other hand, they actively “revised” the poisonous weed “Pingjiang Angry Tide.” Fearing exposure of their anti-party activities, they changed the title to “Angry Tide” and added scenes of dismissal and farewell to plead for Peng Dehuai.

	The reactionary film “Angry Tide,” which underwent three name changes and eight revisions, used extremely vile and covert methods to beautify Peng Dehuai and rehabilitate him. Although the filmmakers deliberately omitted the place names and used the Autumn Harvest Uprising as a cover, the characters, plot, and environment in the film were based on the “Pingjiang Uprising” of 1928.

	Why did the authors use the Autumn Harvest Uprising as a cover to peddle the Pingjiang Uprising? The secret lies here. Because Peng Dehuai always regarded the Pingjiang Uprising as his political capital, portraying himself as the revolutionary leader of the Pingjiang region and the “savior” of the Pingjiang people. In the spring of 1959, Peng Dehuai, in a speech, brazenly distorted history, publicly downplayed the great historical significance of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and exaggerated the role of the “Pingjiang Uprising,” claiming that “the Guangzhou Uprising failed, the Nanchang Uprising also failed, the Autumn Harvest Uprising was about attacking cities and failing to open them, then retreating to a place.” “Before 1928, the revolution was in a low ebb, the low ebb was like the tide retreating to its limit. The signal of the revolutionary tide was the Pingjiang Uprising.”

	Peng Dehuai deliberately downplayed the great significance of the Autumn Harvest Uprising and exaggerated the role of the Pingjiang Uprising, attempting to falsify military history and portray himself as a flag-bearer in the creation of the army, to gain political capital for usurping the Party and the military.

	In fact, the revolutionary flames in the Pingjiang region were entirely ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as 1922, Chairman Mao (then the secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party) personally established the first party cell in Pingjiang. In September 1927, Chairman Mao personally led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising in the Pingjiang and Lianhua areas, creating the world-renowned Jinggangshan revolutionary base. Peng Dehuai, who was sent by the warlord Tang Shengzhi to suppress the peasant movement in Pingjiang, was then surrounded by our local armed forces and had a dog-eat-dog conflict with the warlord He Jian. In a desperate situation, he joined the uprising with the mindset of an “investor.” The merits of the revolutionary movement in the Pingjiang region should all be attributed to Chairman Mao, while Peng Dehuai was merely an opportunist who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks.

	However, the creators of the film “Angry Tide” went to great lengths to erect a monument to this ambitious opportunist who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. The screenwriter, following Peng Dehuai's intentions, wanted to portray Peng Dehuai as “brave in fighting the enemy, a brave son of a peasant.” Based on the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang's black directive “not to be constrained by real people and real events,” he used the character Qiu Jin to beautify Peng Dehuai. The Qiu Jin on the screen was indeed portrayed as a “brave” leader, who “resolutely” decided to attack the city and achieved victory; it was he who led the troops “up to Jinggangshan.” The author also carefully arranged for the masses to sing about the “sun,” “dragon,” and “commander’s flag” (the last draft deleted these), openly singing praises for Peng Dehuai. The film thus portrayed a butcher with blood on his hands as a “brave” “son of a peasant,” beautifying him into the “great savior” of the Pingjiang people.

	It is particularly worth noting that after Peng Dehuai was removed from office, the script underwent three major revisions: first, adding an enemy officer Huang Weiguo, who was described as “joining the KMT for the revolution” and then “surrendering to the Communist Party for the revolution,” and playing a key role in the “city attack”; second, adding the scene where Luo Dacheng insisted on the correct line and was “removed from office”; third, adding the malicious lyrics of the fisherman drummer.

	The filmmakers used Huang Weiguo, an officer under a warlord, to covertly refer to Peng Dehuai, the warlord regiment commander, and went to great lengths to defend Peng Dehuai's crimes of suppressing the revolution. They also worked hard to portray him as a hero who was “wholeheartedly” for the country. The screenwriter deliberately arranged for Huang Weiguo, in the most difficult moment of the revolution, to risk his life to save a Communist Party cadre, attempting to portray Peng Dehuai as a “hero” who saved the revolution and a “benefactor” of the Communist Party.

	When the film depicted Huang Weiguo joining Qiu Jin, he spoke passionately: “The KMT has no hope, I am an ignorant youth who joined the KMT, hoping to serve the country and the people, but they betrayed their promises and slaughtered the poor masses, I took the wrong path...” What a “servant of the country and the people”! The filmmakers used such vile methods to wash away the heinous crimes of Peng Dehuai, the great butcher of the revolutionary masses, making them spotless! Then, they let this “servant of the country and the people” “youth” provide important intelligence, achieving the “city attack” victory, using this to refer to Peng Dehuai's so-called “merits” in the “Pingjiang Uprising.”

	The filmmakers, through Qiu Jin and Huang Weiguo, went to great lengths to beautify Peng Dehuai, and at the same time, they deliberately arranged a “removal from office” scene. This scene is similar to “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” and the two complement each other, singing praises for the removed-from-office Peng Dehuai. The filmmakers portrayed Luo Dacheng as a typical figure who was always correct, even in the situation of losing contact with the upper-level Party, he could still insist on the correct line. For this, the filmmakers specially arranged for the special envoy Wang Huizhi to revoke Luo Dacheng's “all internal and external positions, return to the district Party committee to reflect on errors tomorrow” scene. The film told the audience that the “representative of the Party” was a “tyrannical and despotic” “lord,” while Luo Dacheng was a “good person” who was “everything for the poor people to rise up and seek liberation” and was “deeply loved by the masses.” It was such a “good person” who was “removed from office.” The author intended to use this scene to stir the audience's heartstrings, arouse the audience's sympathy for the “removed-from-office” person, and call on ghosts and snakes to plead for Peng Dehuai. At this time, Luo Dacheng firmly said: “I can go to the Party committee, but the peasant self-defense corps cannot be disbanded!” This is very similar to Hai Rui's words when he was removed from office in “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office”: “A great man stands tall and fearless, how can he fear the danger of death?” Isn't this the same as Peng Dehuai's words after being removed from office: “I have reservations about the Lushan Conference”? After such meticulous portrayal, the author still thought it was not enough and immediately had the fisherman drummer sing a melancholic, sad, and plaintive summoning song for Peng Dehuai: “Sending you to the side of the road, your kindness will never be forgotten, friends and fellow villagers in our hearts, forever looking at each other across mountains and rivers.” In “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” the masses also sang when sending “Hai Qingtian”: “The cold wind blows, thousands of thoughts tug at the heart, Hai father is leaving and cannot be stopped, ten thousand families burn incense for the living Buddha.” The two poems are so similar, isn't this proof that the filmmakers, like Wu Han, were secretly sending signals to Peng Dehuai, expressing their deep sympathy? Not only that, the film also encouraged Peng Dehuai to rise again, saying things like “surviving death to make a revolution, killing the enemy in the rain of bullets,” and “sailing in the wind and waves, I hold the flag and wait for your return.” Isn't this openly encouraging Peng Dehuai to continue his anti-party “ship” in the “wind and waves,” and telling Peng Dehuai that the ghosts and snakes are “waiting for your return,” hoping for his comeback? Isn't this also a true reflection of the situation in 1961 and 1962, when, under the personal leadership of China's Khrushchev, big and small ghosts and snakes all came out, using every means to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai, preparing to “do a big job”?

	Chairman Mao said: “Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention.” The reactionary film “Angry Tide” is a twisted and obscure plot, using Qiu Jin's bravery and combat skills, Huang Weiguo's “serving the country and the people,” and Luo Dacheng's consistent correctness but being removed from office, to beautify Peng Dehuai, rehabilitate him, and engage in counter-revolutionary activities. Although the screenwriter's anti-party methods are so covert and cunning, today, under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, their true form is exposed. We must rise up with the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize and expose this reactionary film!

    彻底批判为彭德怀招魂的反动影片《怒潮》
    北师大井冈山　物教“遵义”
   “雪压冬云白絮飞”。一九六二年，是阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂的年代。
    当时，以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的资本主义复辟势力，在国内外一片疯狂的反华声浪中，向党发动了全面的进攻。中国的赫鲁晓夫公然跳出来，为被罢了官的大野心家、大阴谋家、反革命修正主义分子彭德怀翻案。他叫嚷：彭德怀反党的“意见书”“不少还是符合事实的”，“并不算犯错误”。他恶毒地攻击毛主席亲自领导的对彭德怀反党集团的斗争，是“错误的过火斗争”。在中国的赫鲁晓夫的大力支持和鼓励下，彭德怀在一九六二年六月抛出了一个洋洋八万言的翻案书。与此同时，中国的赫鲁晓夫还通过他在各个领域里的代理人，勾结一批牛鬼蛇神，炮制了《海瑞罢官》等大批毒草，为彭德怀翻案，为复辟资本主义大肆制造舆论。反动影片《怒潮》，就是在这乌云乱翻的阵阵妖风中出笼的。
    反动影片《怒潮》，原名《平江怒潮》，剧本初稿是在彭德怀的授意下创作的。彭德怀曾经说：“平江暴动要好好写一写，材料我可以提供。”彭德怀还恬不知耻地说：“要写我的话，可以这样写：对敌斗争勇敢，是一个勇敢的农民的儿子”。这部影片的主要编剧是彭德怀反党集团的干将，他听了心领神会，于是从一九五八年开始动手编写电影文学剧本，公然为彭德怀树碑立传。
    一九五九年八月，庐山会议一声霹雳，罢了反党分子彭德怀的官。他的大小娄罗一时慌了手脚。他们惊魂初定以后，立即拚命地为其主子招魂奔命。他们一方面通过编写《平江革命斗争史》，建立“平江革命斗争史展览馆”来为彭德怀歌功颂德；另一方面积极“修改”《平江怒潮》这株大毒草。他们怕露出反党的马脚，把片名改成《怒潮》，同时又增加了罢官、送别的情节，来为彭德怀鸣冤叫屈。
    《怒潮》这部三易其名、八易其稿的反动影片，采用了非常卑劣非常隐蔽的手法，来美化彭德怀，为彭德怀翻案。影片的炮制者虽然故意把地名隐去，又打起秋收暴动的幌子，但是，影片中的人物、故事情节和环境却是发生在一九二八年的“平江起义”。
    作者为什么要挂起秋收起义的幌子贩卖平江起义的私货呢？奥妙就在这里。因为彭德怀一直把平江起义作为他的政治资本，把自己打扮成平江地区的革命领袖、平江人民的“救星”。一九五九年春，彭德怀在一次讲话中，竟然篡改历史，公开贬低我们伟大领袖毛主席所领导的秋收起义的伟大历史意义，拚命吹嘘“平江起义”的作用，胡说什么“广州暴动失败了，南昌起义也失败了，秋收起义就是打城市打不开，然后退到一个地方。”“一九二八年以前处于革命低潮，低潮就是海水的潮流退到不能再退了。革命来潮的信号就是平江起义”。
    彭德怀极力贬低秋收起义的伟大意义，夸大平江起义的作用，妄图通过篡改军史，把自己描绘成创建军队的一面旗帜，以捞取篡党篡军的政治资本。
    事实上，平江地区的革命烈火，完全是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的。早在一九二二年，毛主席（当时是中共湘区委员会书记）就亲手创立了平江第一个党小组。一九二七年九月毛主席又亲自在平、浏地区领导了著名的秋收起义，开创了举世闻名的井冈山革命根据地。而彭德怀这个由军阀唐生智派往平江去镇压农民运动的刽子手，当时正陷于我地方武装的重重包围之中，同时又与军阀何键闹狗咬狗的矛盾。在走投无路的情况下，他带着“入股”的投机心理，参加了起义。平江地区革命运动的功绩，完全应归于毛主席，而彭德怀只不过是一个混入革命队伍的投机分子。
    但是，影片《怒潮》的炮制者，却挖空心思地为这个混入革命队伍的大野心家树碑立传。编剧秉承彭德怀的意旨，一心想把彭德怀打扮成“对敌斗争勇敢，是一个勇敢的农民的儿子。”他根据反革命修正主义分子周扬“不要受真人真事的限制”的黑指示，通过邱金这个人物的形象，极力美化彭德怀。出现在银幕上的邱金，确实被描写成一个“勇敢”的闯将，是他“果断地”下了攻城的决心，并且取得了胜利；是他带着队伍“上了井冈山”。作者还煞费苦心地通过群众之口唱出什么“太阳”啊，“一条龙”啊，“帅旗”啊（最后一稿删去了），明目张胆地为彭德怀唱颂歌。影片就这样把一个双手沾满革命人民鲜血的刽子手打扮成一个“对敌斗争勇敢”的“农民的儿子”，美化成了平江人民的“大救星”。
    特别值得指出的是，剧本在彭德怀被罢官以后，又作了三处重大的修改：一是增加了一个敌军参谋黄维国，影片写他“为革命而投身国民党”，又“为革命反正投奔共产党”，还在“扑城”中起了关键作用；二是增加了罗大成坚持正确路线而被“罢官”的情节；三是增加了渔鼓老人的恶毒的唱词。
    影片的炮制者借黄维国这个军阀手下的参谋，暗中影射彭德怀这个军阀团长，千方百计地为彭德怀镇压革命的罪恶行径进行辩护，又费尽心机地把他打扮成一个一心“为国”的英雄。编剧故意安排了黄参谋在革命最困难的关头，冒着生命危险救了共产党干部的情节，企图把彭德怀打扮成挽救革命的“英雄”、共产党的“恩人”。
    影片描写黄维国投奔邱金时，还慷慨陈词：“国民党没有希望了，我是个无知的青年，投身国民党，实指望能报国为民，没想到他们背信弃义屠杀穷苦百姓，我走错了路……。”好一个“报国为民”！影片的炮制者正是通过这种卑劣的手法，把彭德怀这个屠杀革命群众的大刽子手的累累罪行，洗刷得一干二净！接着，又让这个“报国为民”的“青年”，提供了重要的情报，取得了“扑城”的胜利，以此来影射彭德怀在“平江起义”中建立的所谓“功勋”。
    影片的炮制者苦心孤诣地通过邱金和黄维国来美化彭德怀，同时又别有用心地安排了一场“罢官”的戏。这场戏与《海瑞罢官》有着异曲同工之妙，二者一配一搭，相得益彰，为被罢了官的彭德怀抚尸招魂。影片的炮制者把罗大成描写成一贯正确的典型，甚至在与上级党失掉联系的情况下，仍能坚持正确路线。为此，影片的炮制者特别安排了特派员王怀志撤销罗大成“党内外一切职务，明天就回区党委检讨错误”这样一场戏。影片告诉观众，“党”的代表是一个“专横独断”“昏庸霸道”的“老爷”，而罗大成则是“一切为了穷苦人民翻身求解放”、“深受群众拥戴”的“青天”。就是这样一个“大好人”却被“罢官”了。作者正是企图以此情此景来牵动观众的心弦，引起观众对被“罢官”者的同情，呼唤牛鬼蛇神起来为彭德怀鸣冤叫屈。此时的罗大成坚毅地说道：“我可以去党委，工农自卫队不能解散！”这多么象《海瑞罢官》中海瑞被罢官时所说的“大丈夫顶天立地，岂可怕杀身之祸”，这不就是彭德怀被罢官后叫嚷的“我对庐山会议有保留”吗？作者作了这样一番精心的刻划之后，还嫌不够，紧接着通过渔鼓老人为彭德怀唱了一支缠绵、忧伤、如泣如诉的招魂曲：“送君送到大路旁，君的恩情永不忘，农友乡亲心里亮，隔山隔水永相望。”《海瑞罢官》中群众送“海青天”时也唱：“天寒地冻风萧萧，去思牵心千万条，海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧。”异曲同工，两首诗这么相似，这不正说明影片的炮制者同吴晗一样，向彭德怀暗送秋波，寄予了满腔的同情吗？不仅如此，影片还给彭德怀打气，鼓动他东山再起，什么“死里逃生闹革命，枪林弹雨把敌杀”，什么“风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还。”这不是明目张胆地鼓励彭德怀在“风里浪里”继续行他的反党贼“船”，并且告诉彭德怀：牛鬼蛇神们正在“望君还”，盼着他东山再起吗？这不也正是一九六一年和一九六二年，在中国的赫鲁晓夫亲自带领下，大大小小牛鬼蛇神一齐出动，千方百计为彭德怀翻案，准备“大干一场”的真实写照吗？
    毛主席说：“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。”反动影片《怒潮》正是通过曲折、隐晦的故事情节，借邱金的勇敢善战，黄维国的“报国为民”，罗大成的一贯正确而被罢官，来美化彭德怀、为彭德怀翻案，进行反革命活动的。尽管编剧的反党手法是如何的隐蔽和狡猾，今天它在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下原形毕露了。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把这部反动影片批深批臭！
