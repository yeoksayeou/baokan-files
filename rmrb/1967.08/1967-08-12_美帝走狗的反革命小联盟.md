Under the orchestration of US imperialism, a handful of its running dogs in Southeast Asia—reactionaries from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, "Singapore," and "Malaysia"—recently held a secret meeting in Bangkok, formally forming the so-called "Association of Southeast Asian Nations." This is a thoroughly reactionary alliance against China, against communism, and against the people, and it is another tool for US imperialism and Soviet revisionism to push their neo-colonialism in Asia.

In its "declaration," this so-called "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" claims that its purpose is to "accelerate economic development, social progress, and cultural development in this region." This is sheer nonsense. As early as May this year, the reactionary leader of Indonesia, Malik, revealed that this "regional cooperation" organization in Southeast Asia "can be called a certain defense plan." Some right-wing military figures in Indonesia have even more blatantly called for the formation of a "Southeast Asian Collective Defense Organization" to counter the so-called "threat from China." Even this "declaration" itself does not hide the fact that it is openly justifying the US military bases in Southeast Asia. All of this fully exposes that this reactionary group, which is masquerading under the banner of economic "cooperation," is a thoroughgoing anti-China military alliance.

US imperialism has long attempted to establish a "crescent-shaped" encirclement around China. Now, it has further colluded with the Soviet revisionist clique, attempting to establish a "full-moon-shaped" encirclement around China. This so-called "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" is just one link in this anti-China encirclement. However, whether it is a "crescent" or a "full moon," they are all fragmented and disorganized, not amounting to much.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

US imperialism has been trying to establish aggressive military alliances in Asia, and each one has collapsed. But it never gives up. In the Middle East, it formed the "Baghdad Pact Organization," which collapsed, and then it formed the "Central Treaty Organization." Now, this aggressive alliance has practically disintegrated. In Southeast Asia, it is the same. The original "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" is already a hollow shell. So, it comes up with new tricks and forms what it calls the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations." These facts once again prove that US imperialism will never accept its failure. Before its ultimate demise, it will always make desperate struggles.

The running dogs of US imperialism in Asia have gathered together, which does not indicate their strength but rather reflects their weakness. These countries and regions are ablaze with the fiery people's revolutionary struggles. Their reactionary rule is in a state of turmoil. They attempt, with the support of US imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to join forces to extinguish the revolution, which is sheer fantasy. These reactionaries are all like mud statues crossing a river, each unable to save itself. Their forming a reactionary mini-league will certainly not save them from their doomed fate!

### 美帝走狗的反革命小联盟

    美帝走狗的反革命小联盟
    在美帝国主义的一手策划下，它的一小撮在东南亚的走狗，印尼、泰国、菲律宾、“新加坡”、“马来西亚”等国家和地区的反动派，最近在曼谷开了一个黑会，正式拼凑了所谓“东南亚国家联盟”。这是一个地地道道的反华反共反人民的反革命联盟，是美帝苏修在亚洲推行新殖民主义的又一个工具。
    这个所谓“东南亚国家联盟”，在它的“声明”中，说什么其宗旨是“加速这个区域的经济发展、社会进步和文化发展”。这是鬼话。早在今年五月，印尼反动派头目马利克就透露，这个东南亚“地区性合作”组织，“可以称为某种防御计划”。而印尼的一些右派军人则更露骨地叫嚷，要拼凑“东南亚共同防御组织”来对付所谓“来自中国的威胁”。就是这个“声明”本身，也毫不掩饰地公开为美国在东南亚的军事基地进行辩解。所有这些，完全暴露了这个挂着经济“合作”旗号的反动集团，是一个彻头彻尾的反华军事联盟。
    美帝国主义早就试图在中国周围建立“新月形”包围圈。现在，它又进一步同苏修集团勾结起来，妄图在中国周围建立一个“全月形”包围圈。所谓“东南亚国家联盟”，就是这个反华包围圈的一个环节。但，“新月”也好，“全月”也好，都是七零八落，支离破碎，不成个样子。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    美帝国主义在亚洲搞侵略性军事联盟，搞一个垮一个。但是它总不死心。在西亚搞了个“巴格达条约组织”，垮台了，又搞了一个“中央条约组织”。现在这个侵略性联盟实际上已经瓦解了。在东南亚也是一样，原来的“东南亚条约组织”已经名存实亡。于是它又花样翻新，搞什么“东南亚国家联盟”。这些事实又一次证明，美帝国主义决不会甘心自己的失败，它在最后灭亡之前，总是要不断地进行疯狂挣扎的。
    美帝国主义在亚洲的这伙走狗们纠集在一起，丝毫也不表示它们的强大，恰恰反映了它们的虚弱。这些国家和地区正在燃烧着人民革命斗争的熊熊烈火。它们的反动统治正处在风雨飘摇之中。它们企图在美帝苏修的支撑下，勾结起来扑灭革命，这完全是痴心妄想。这些反动派，一个一个都是泥菩萨过河，自身难保，它们搞个反革命的小联盟，又岂能挽救灭亡的命运！
