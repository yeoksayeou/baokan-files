The reactionary film "The Storm" is a big poisonous weed to create public opinion for exonerating the big ambitionist and conspirator Peng Dehuai. It blatantly distorts party history and military history, greatly glorifies Peng Dehuai, and deliberately denigrates the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It viciously directs its spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao.

The main author of "The Storm" is a loyal henchman of the Peng Dehuai anti-party clique. After Peng Dehuai, the right-opportunist, was dismissed at the Lushan Conference in 1959, this anti-party element was extremely discontented and wanted to exonerate his master. During the three years of temporary difficulties, with international and domestic clouds swirling, the "winter drums" sounded, and "spring grass" sprouted, the anti-party elements all expressed their desire to "make a big push," and he also became restless and couldn't hold back. Sure enough, under the direct call and support of the Khrushchev of China, he "burst out," brandishing his spear and leaping on his horse, becoming the vanguard for exonerating Peng Dehuai and creating public opinion.

To exonerate Peng Dehuai, one must erect monuments and biographies for him. Initially, Peng Dehuai joined the revolutionary ranks with the idea of "investing." The "Pingjiang Uprising" was his "old capital." Therefore, whenever "Pingjiang Uprising" is mentioned, people easily associate it with Peng Dehuai. Moreover, the anti-party elements distorted history, hailing the Pingjiang Uprising as a "great" event with "national revolutionary significance" at a "historical turning point." Peng Dehuai also boasted that the Pingjiang Uprising was the "signal of the revolutionary tide in China." Thus, Peng Dehuai's loyal henchman focused on the "Pingjiang Uprising" issue. To support Peng Dehuai's continued attack on the Party, he initiated the compilation and promotion of Peng Dehuai's "History of the Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle," established the "Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle Exhibition Hall," wrote articles, gave speeches, and used every opportunity to praise Peng Dehuai among the masses. At the same time, he actively produced the screenplay for this big poisonous weed, "The Storm."

However, the Lushan Conference had already dismissed the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai. Therefore, the author did not dare to openly depict Peng Dehuai and the "Pingjiang Uprising," but had to use extremely covert and circuitous methods. Not openly writing about "Pingjiang," but still having to "suggest" "Pingjiang"; not concretely portraying a character similar to Peng Dehuai in identity and experience, but still having to sing the praises of Peng Dehuai. How to do it? The author used the method of mixing fish eyes with pearls and combining front and back to peddle private goods.

Whether in terms of characters, plots, or scenes, the film is about the "Pingjiang Uprising." For example, the Nationalist regiment commander Yan Zijian in the film is the anti-revolutionary pacification commander and household militia chief Yan Zhongru and the fake Pingjiang magistrate Wang Zijian at that time. The film's depiction of the disguised attack on the temple fair to capture the city is the event of the Pingjiang peasants "capturing the city" in March 1927. This is just the author's deliberate transfer, combined with Peng Dehuai's "Pingjiang Uprising" in July 1928, to avoid exposing the anti-party footprints. The scenes in the film where Qiu Jin leads a large number of troops to capture Pingjiang and other plots are taken from Peng Dehuai's stories. As for the scenes, every mountain, river, grass, and tree in the film were designed according to the original appearance of Pingjiang in 1928 under the personal supervision of the main author of the film. The boats are Pingjiang boats, and even those from Lingling are not allowed. To restore the city walls of Pingjiang during the "Pingjiang Uprising," a huge amount of money was spent on reconstruction. The route of Qiu Jin's attack on the city and the placement of the pine tree cannon positions were all filmed according to the situation of Peng Dehuai's "Pingjiang Uprising" at that time. All this is to connect with Peng Dehuai's "Pingjiang Uprising," praise Peng Dehuai's "great achievements," and prepare public opinion for exonerating Peng Dehuai.

The story of "The Storm" begins with the Northern Expedition Army, with the assistance of the workers' and peasants' armed forces, capturing Pingjiang. The Nationalists betrayed the revolution and carried out a bloody massacre of the revolutionary masses. At this critical moment, the film, through the dialogue between the two surviving party members Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin, repeatedly tells the audience: "The Party Central Committee is too far away from us, and the district party committee has also lost contact." This means that the Pingjiang Uprising was carried out without any superior leadership, with the "grassroots leadership cadres" in Pingjiang "mobilizing and organizing the masses, opening up revolutionary bases, and establishing self-defense armed forces."

The film also tells the audience that at that time, Pingjiang not only established people's armed forces but also these armed forces were already quite mature and had a series of flexible strategies and tactics. They could not only annihilate the enemy in whole companies and battalions but also annihilate the Nationalist regular army in whole regiments. They not only wiped out Liu's stronghold at Liujiaping but also captured the city of Pingjiang defended by the Nationalist regular army.

The film also explains that when the right-opportunists forced the "Pingjiang Workers' and Peasants' Self-Defense Corps" to surrender their weapons, the party leaders in the Pingjiang area firmly resisted and successfully carried out the struggle against the right-opportunists.

Obviously, the impression the audience gets from the film is that the revolutionary struggle here has reached a very mature level. And all this was achieved before finding Comrade Mao.

After watching such a film, any revolutionary comrade with a little knowledge of party history and military history will naturally ask:

After the failure of the great revolution, under whose guidance was the first shot fired against the Nationalist reactionaries?

Under whose leadership did our party create the first completely new type of people's army and establish the first revolutionary base?

Under whose leadership did our party open up the road of establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing national power?

Isn't it precisely our great leader Chairman Mao! The description in the film is the most brutal and shameless distortion and erasure of party history and military history.

In fact, the peasant movement in the Pingjiang area was also developed under the direct care of Chairman Mao. The first batch of party members in the Pingjiang area were personally introduced into the party by Chairman Mao, and thus the first party branch in Pingjiang was established. In 1926, the Hunan Provincial Peasant Representatives Conference was held, and the peasant representatives from Pingjiang directly listened to Chairman Mao's report and received Chairman Mao's instructions. The peasant struggle in Pingjiang has a certain position in history, but this should all be attributed to Chairman Mao and the party. Where was Peng Dehuai at that time? He was still a Nationalist reactionary military officer suppressing the peasant movement!

When the screenplay for "The Storm" was just written, someone had raised sharp criticism. The main author of the film immediately retorted angrily: "The Comrade Mao at that time was not the Chairman Mao of today, and his thoughts were not as high as today's." He also said madly: "If it were any higher, it would not be the thought of Chairman Mao at that time." He slandered that Chairman Mao's thought at that time was not high, but he wrote the revolutionary struggle in the Pingjiang area so highly, what was his intention? It was to denigrate Chairman Mao and praise Peng Dehuai.

Peng Dehuai is an old opportunist, an old ambitionist, and an old warlord. Not to mention other things, even when he was just starting his troop, he was a loyal executor of the "left" opportunist line. He repeatedly led the troops to attack big cities, causing serious losses to the party and the Red Army. The author, in the film, not only did not criticize him at all but also embellished him. He even praised some of Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line's black goods in a flattering manner.

However, up to this point, the author of "The Storm" was still not satisfied. The key issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is the dismissal. The author of "The Storm" also focused on the dismissal issue. The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Hai Rui's office, the party dismissed Peng Dehuai's office, and Wang Huizhi dismissed Luo Dacheng's office. After the special envoy Wang said to Luo Dacheng, "I revoke all your party and non-party positions," the old fisherman then sang a song of "Seeing You Off." This song can be said to be the climax of the entire "The Storm." It most concentratedly expresses the sorrow of the ghosts and snakes for Peng Dehuai's dismissal, most concentratedly expresses the longing and eager expectation of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the bourgeois elements for Peng Dehuai, his "kindness," "brightness in the heart," "never forgetting," and "forever looking forward." At the end of this song, it even sings the reactionary words "I hold the spear to wait for your return," hoping that Peng Dehuai will rise again, leading the ghosts and snakes to pick up the gun to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat!

The reactionary theme of "The Storm" can be summarized in one word: "anger." Anger at what? Anger at the party, anger at Chairman Mao.

"Ants trying to shake a tree, how easy can it be?" Not long ago, these "giant objects" and "buzzing flies" were still crazily engaged in anti-revolutionary activities to seize the party and the state. Now they have one by one fallen into the people's encirclement. However, we must not be complacent. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle!" We must continue to advance, victory after victory, and thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in politics, ideology, and theory, and fight them down and stink them up.

    《怒潮》是为大野心家彭德怀翻案的大毒草
    空军直属机关　红文
    反动影片《怒潮》是为大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀翻案制造舆论的大毒草。它公然篡改党史军史，大肆美化彭德怀，极力贬低战无不胜的毛泽东思想，恶毒地把矛头直接指向我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    《怒潮》的主要作者是彭德怀反党集团的忠实干将。一九五九年庐山会议罢了右倾机会主义分子彭德怀的官，这个反党分子如丧考妣，心怀不满，一心想为其主子翻案。到了三年暂时困难时期，国际、国内乌云乱翻，“腊鼓鸣”，“春草生”，反党分子纷纷表示要“大干一场”，他也蠢蠢欲动，按捺不住了。果然，在中国的赫鲁晓夫的直接号召和支持下，他“破门而出”，挺枪跃马，充当为彭德怀翻案造舆论的急先锋。
    要给彭德怀翻案，就必须为他树碑立传。想当初，彭德怀就是带着“入股”的思想混入革命队伍的，“平江起义”是他的“老血本”。因此，一提“平江起义”，人们就很容易联想到彭德怀。而且，反党分子篡改了历史，把平江起义吹捧成为“在历史转折阶段”上“具有全国革命历史意义”的“伟大”事件，彭德怀也自我吹嘘地胡说什么平江起义是中国“革命来潮的信号”。于是，彭德怀的这个忠实干将就在“平江起义”问题上大做文章。为了配合彭德怀继续向党进攻，他策动编印宣扬彭德怀的《平江革命斗争史》，建立“平江革命斗争史展览馆”，写文章、作报告，利用一切机会在群众中大肆吹捧彭德怀。与此同时，他积极编出了这棵大毒草《怒潮》的电影文学剧本。
    但是，庐山会议已经罢了右倾机会主义分子彭德怀的官。因此，作者不敢明目张胆地描写彭德怀和“平江起义”，而不得不采取极其隐蔽曲折的手法。不公开写“平江”，而又必须“暗示”出“平江”；不具体塑造一个类似彭德怀的身份和经历的人物，而又要歌颂彭德怀，怎么办呢？作者采取了鱼目混珠、前后掺合的办法，来贩卖私货。
    无论从人物、情节和场景来看，影片都是表现“平江起义”的。例如影片中的国民党团长阎紫剑，就是当时平江国民党反动派清乡司令、挨户团主任阎仲儒和伪平江知事王紫剑。影片描写化装赶庙会扑城故事，就是一九二七年三月平江农民的“扑城”之事。这不过是作者故意移来，和一九二八年七月彭德怀“平江起义”的事相掺合，以免露出反党的马脚。而影片中邱金率大队人马攻克平江等若干情节，就是取材于彭德怀的故事。至于场景，影片中的一山一水，一草一木，都是在影片主要作者的亲自督阵下，按一九二八年的平江原来面目进行设计的。船是平江船，连澧陵的都不行。为了再现“平江起义”时的平江城楼，不惜耗费巨资进行重建。邱金攻城的路线，松树炮位的安置，都是按当时彭德怀“平江起义”时的情景进行拍摄的。这一切就是为了和彭德怀的“平江起义”挂上钩，歌颂彭德怀的“丰功伟绩”，为彭德怀翻案做舆论准备。
    《怒潮》的故事是从北伐军在工农武装协助下攻克平江，国民党叛变，对革命群众进行血腥大屠杀开始的。在这紧急关头，影片通过罗大成和邱金两个幸存的党员的对话，一再告诉观众：“党中央离我们太远，区党委又失掉了联系。”这就是说，平江起义是在没有任何上级领导的情况下，平江的“基层领导骨干”“动员组织群众，开辟革命根据地，建立自卫武装”的。
    影片还告诉观众，当时平江不仅建立了人民武装，而且这支武装已经相当成熟，已经有了一系列机动灵活的战略战术。不但可以整班整连地歼灭敌人，而且还可以整团地歼灭国民党正规军。不但一下子端掉了刘团总的老巢刘家桥，还一举攻克了国民党正规军防守的平江城。
    影片还说明，当右倾机会主义分子逼迫平江“工农自卫队”交出武装时，平江地区党的领导人坚决进行了抵制，胜利地进行了反右倾的斗争。
    显然，观众通过影片得到的总印象是，这里的革命斗争，已达到非常成熟的程度。而且这一切都是在找到毛委员之前取得的。
    看了这样的影片，任何一个稍有一点党史军史知识的革命同志，都会理所当然地要提出质问：
    大革命失败之后，究竟是在谁的思想指导下打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪？
    究竟是在谁的领导下我们党创建了第一支完全新型的人民军队，建立了第一个革命根据地？
    究竟是在谁的领导下，我们党开辟了建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国政权的道路？
    难道不正是我们的伟大领袖毛主席吗！影片的这种描写是对党史军史最粗暴最无耻的篡改和抹杀。
    实际上，平江地区的农民运动也是在毛主席的直接关怀下发展起来的。平江地区的第一批党员就是毛主席亲自介绍入党的，从此才有了平江的第一个党支部。一九二六年召开湖南全省农民代表大会，平江的农民代表直接听了毛主席的报告，接受了毛主席的指示。平江的农民斗争在历史上有一定的地位，但这完全应该归功于毛主席，归功于党。当时彭德怀在哪里呢？他还是一个镇压农民运动的国民党反动军官！
    当《怒潮》剧本刚刚写出时，有人曾提出过尖锐的批评。影片的主要作者一听就气势汹汹地反驳道：“那时的毛委员不是今天的毛主席，思想没有今天高。”他还丧心病狂地说：“再高就不是当时毛主席的思想了。”他污蔑当时毛主席的思想不高，但又把平江地区的革命斗争写的那么高，用意何在呢？就是为了贬低毛主席，吹捧彭德怀。
    彭德怀是个老机会主义分子，老野心家，老军阀。别的不算，就算他“想当初，老子的队伍新开张”那时候，他就是“左”倾路线的忠实执行者。他一再拉着队伍打大城市，给党和红军造成了严重损失。作者在影片中，不仅没有丝毫的批判，反而倍加粉饰。甚至把彭德怀的一些资产阶级军事路线的黑货，也加以肉麻的吹捧。
    然而，到此为止，《怒潮》的作者还不感到满足。《海瑞罢官》的要害问题是罢官。《怒潮》的作者也抓住罢官问题大做文章。嘉靖罢了海瑞的官，党罢了彭德怀的官，王怀志则罢了罗大成的官。当王特派员厉声对罗大成说：“我撤销你党内外一切职务”之后，渔鼓老人接着唱出了一支《送君》歌。这首歌可以说是整个《怒潮》的点睛之笔。它最集中地表达了牛鬼蛇神们对彭德怀罢官的哀伤，最集中地寄托了地富反坏右和资产阶级分子对彭德怀的无限怀念和迫切期望，对他的“恩情”“心里亮”“永不忘”“永相望”。在这首歌的末尾甚至唱出了“我执梭标望君还”这样的反动词句，希望彭德怀东山再起，率领着牛鬼蛇神们拿起枪杆子来颠覆无产阶级专政！
      《怒潮》的反动主题概括起来说，就是一个“怒”字，“怒”在何处？“怒”在党身上，“怒”在毛主席身上。
    “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。曾几何时，这些“庞然大物”和“嗡嗡叫”的苍蝇们还在疯狂地进行篡党篡政的反革命活动，现在他们已经一个一个地陷入了人民的包围之中。然而，我们决不能麻痹。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”！再接再厉，乘胜前进，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭。
