The People's Daily reports: According to Xinhua News Agency, newspapers in Albania and Vietnam, the Liberation Radio Station in South Vietnam, and the Pathet Lao Radio Station have all published commentaries to warmly congratulate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Albanian newspaper *Voice of the People* published an article on August 1 by Qiao Ke, the Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, which enthusiastically praises the glorious combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past 40 years under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

The article states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army adheres to the Party's guidance of "political command over the military" and has become a highly revolutionary and proletarianized army. Such an army is invincible. If imperialists or modern revisionists dare to launch any adventures against the People's Republic of China, the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army will deliver a crushing blow to the aggressors.

The editorials of *Unity* and *Labor* on the same day state in the article titled "Long Live the Chinese People's Liberation Army" that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new type of revolutionary army created, organized, and nurtured by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. It is making outstanding contributions in the further development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The editorial of the Vietnamese *People's Daily* states: "The history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the history of the revolutionary wars of China under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the beloved Chairman Mao."

The editorial states: "After 40 years of heroic struggle and glorious victories, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great revolutionary army created and led by the great Communist Party of China. It is an army that comes from the people, fights for the people's interests, is closely connected with the people, and enjoys the wholehearted support of the people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a brave, unyielding, fearless, and self-sacrificing revolutionary army that is ready to devote itself to the revolution at any time."

The editorial states that in the revolutionary struggle, our military and people have learned many valuable experiences about revolutionary warfare and people's warfare from the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The editorial concludes by wishing the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the beloved Chairman Mao, to achieve even more glorious successes. It wishes for the combat unity and close friendship between the peoples and armies of Vietnam and China to be further strengthened and developed.

The editorial of the Vietnamese *People's Army Daily* states that the glorious development process of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is closely linked with the history of the steadfast struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong.

The editorial states that the armed forces of Vietnam are proud to have the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army as their strong comrades, brothers, and close comrades.

The Liberation Radio Station in South Vietnam published a commentary on the same day stating that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has written a glorious chapter in the cause of liberation for the Chinese people and all oppressed peoples of the world.

The commentary states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, upholding the tradition of patriotism and the lofty spirit of internationalism, is always on high alert and ready for battle. Together with the peoples of Indochina and the peoples of various Asian countries, it has repeatedly thwarted all the plots and actions of aggression by colonialism and imperialism led by American imperialism. The selfless and sincere assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean people in their war against the American imperialist aggressors is a vivid and eloquent proof of this.

The commentary states that the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all the Chinese people have repeatedly reaffirmed that regardless of how far the American aggressors want to expand the war, regardless of how great the national sacrifice, the 700 million Chinese people will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and wholeheartedly support and help the Vietnamese people to defeat the American imperialist aggressors. The people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces sincerely thank this resolute, thorough, and sincere assistance and regard it as a great and extremely valuable encouragement for their struggle against the American imperialist aggressors.

The Pathet Lao Radio Station published a commentary on the same day stating that over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution, fought bravely, and rapidly developed and grown stronger, making a decisive contribution to the glorious victories of the Chinese revolution. At present, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become the strongest revolutionary army. It is carrying out the task of defending the cause of socialist construction in China and is ready at any time to smash all the war adventure plots of American imperialism, defending peace in Asia and the world.

    文章说，中国人民解放军贯彻党关于“政治统帅军事”的教导，已经成为一支非常革命化和无产阶级化的军队。这样的军队是不可战胜的。如果帝国主义者或者现代修正主义者敢于对人民中国进行任何冒险，光荣的中国人民解放军将给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。

    越南《人民报》的社论说：“中国人民解放军的历史，是在伟大的中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席领导下的中国革命战争的历史。”
    社论说：“经过四十年英勇战斗和取得了辉煌胜利的中国人民解放军，是一支由伟大的中国共产党缔造和领导的伟大的革命军队，是一支从人民中来，为人民的利益而战斗，同人民血肉相连，得到人民全心全意拥护的军队。中国人民解放军，是一支勇敢坚强、不屈不挠，不怕艰苦牺牲、不怕任何凶恶敌人、随时准备为革命而献身的革命军队。”
