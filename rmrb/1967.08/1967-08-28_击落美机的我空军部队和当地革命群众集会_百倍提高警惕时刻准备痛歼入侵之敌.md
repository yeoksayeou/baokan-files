Recently, in the skies over a certain place in Guangxi, our heroic air force units completely annihilated two U.S. A-6 type bandit planes and captured one American air pirate. On the afternoon of the 26th, over 4,000 local poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses held a meeting in a certain place in Guangxi. They strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The military and civilian attendees unanimously declared: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people" and to seize the revolution, promote preparedness, production, and work. We will heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, stand ready, and be prepared at any moment to annihilate the invading enemy, to defend our national defense and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting began amidst shouts of long live our great leader Chairman Mao, wishing him ten thousand years of life. When the personnel of the units that had performed meritorious deeds in this battle and those who had performed meritorious deeds in the recent three victories in three battles entered the venue, the entire audience shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The attendees first read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they are bound to follow this logic. The whole army, all officers and soldiers, must not for a moment relax their vigilance against the enemy. They must maintain high alertness against the enemy. Any idea of relaxing vigilance and underestimating the enemy is wrong."

The entire audience then angrily shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Condemn U.S. imperialism's heinous crimes of invading our country!"

The responsible person of the air force unit that performed meritorious deeds, Yu Xifu, the model representative Xiao Zongling, Sun Xiaoyi who was awarded a second-class merit citation in the three victories in three battles, and Zhou Xiaosi, the representative of the unit that shot down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance plane on April 29, spoke at the meeting. Xiao Zongling, in his speech, angrily condemned the U.S. bandits for crazily bombing Vietnamese cities and villages, slaughtering the Vietnamese people, and in defiance of our repeated warnings, repeatedly violating our sacred airspace, bombing and strafing our fishing boats, and injuring our commune members. Xiao Zongling pointed out that U.S. imperialism has committed heinous crimes against our people, and this account must be settled thoroughly.

The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses expressed in their speeches that they will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," further do a good job in supporting the army, believe in and rely on the PLA, do a good job in joint defense by military and civilians, and be prepared at any moment to fight side by side with the PLA. If the enemy dares to invade, it will be annihilated in the vast ocean of people's war.

    击落美机的我空军部队和当地革命群众集会
    百倍提高警惕时刻准备痛歼入侵之敌
    据新华社南宁二十七日电　最近在广西某地上空全歼两架美国A—6型强盗飞机并活捉一名美国飞贼的我英雄空军部队和当地贫下中农代表、红卫兵小将以及革命群众四千多人，二十六日下午在广西某地举行集会，强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行。到会军民一致表示：坚决响应毛主席的“拥军爱民”和抓革命，促战备、促生产、促工作的伟大号召，百倍提高警惕，严阵以待，时刻准备痛歼入侵之敌，为保卫祖国国防和保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
    大会在一片敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆的欢呼声中开始。当这次作战有功部队人员和曾在不久前的三战三捷中荣立战功的部队人员进入会场时，全场高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”到会军民首先齐声朗读毛主席语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”全场接着愤怒高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“声讨美帝国主义侵略我国的滔天罪行！”
    作战有功部队空军某部负责人于希富、功臣代表萧宗玲、在三战三捷的战斗中荣立二等功的孙孝义、四月二十九日击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机的有功部队代表周孝四等，先后在会上发言。萧宗玲在发言中愤怒谴责美国强盗疯狂地轰炸越南的城镇和乡村，屠杀越南人民，并且不顾我国的一再警告，不断侵犯我国神圣领空，轰炸扫射我国渔船，打伤我人民公社社员。萧宗玲指出，美帝国主义对我国人民犯下了滔天罪行，这笔账是一定要彻底清算的。
    贫下中农和革命群众代表在发言中表示，坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，进一步作好拥军工作，相信解放军、依靠解放军，搞好军民联防，时刻准备和解放军并肩战斗，敌人胆敢来侵犯，就把它消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
