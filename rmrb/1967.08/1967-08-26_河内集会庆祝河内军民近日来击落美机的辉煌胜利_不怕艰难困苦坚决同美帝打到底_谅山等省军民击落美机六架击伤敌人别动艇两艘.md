Hanoi held a rally to celebrate the glorious victory of Hanoi military and civilians in shooting down U.S. aircraft in recent days. They vowed to bravely overcome all difficulties and resolutely fight the U.S. imperialists to the end. Military and civilians in the provinces of Lang Son and others shot down six U.S. aircraft and damaged two enemy patrol boats.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24 - Representatives from various sectors of the people of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and the people's armed forces held a rally on the evening of August 23 to enthusiastically celebrate the glorious victories achieved by the military and civilians of Hanoi in recent days in punishing American air pirates. They strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" crimes of continuously bombing Hanoi. The participants were full of spirit and fighting spirit, shouting slogans such as "Be vigilant at all times," "Determined to defeat the American aggressors!" "The Vietnamese people will win, U.S. imperialism will fail!"

Chen Wei Xing, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically congratulating the military and civilians of Hanoi on their recent great achievements. He said, the victory cannon fire in Hanoi is a response to the murderers in the White House and the Pentagon: their bombs cannot shake our resolve to fight to the end. The capital's military and civilians, together with the people of the whole country, will resolutely implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call on July 17, 1966, to overcome hardships and sacrifices and fight to the end. Chen Wei Xing said, the more crimes the crazy U.S. imperialists commit, the deeper the hatred of our people, and the stronger our determination to annihilate them.

Air Force representative Du Guang Ding warned in his speech: The brutal bombing of Hanoi by U.S. imperialists not only does not shake the fighting will of Hanoi military and civilians and the military and civilians of the whole country, but on the contrary, will only suffer more severe and shameful defeats. He said, the units defending the capital will be more vigilant and resolutely fight to thoroughly smash the enemy's war "escalation" plot.

Representative of the Hanoi transportation and transportation units, Deng Wen Jing said: The bombs of the American aggressors cannot shake our iron will to ensure smooth transportation. We guarantee to the Party Central Committee, the government, Chairman Ho, and the people of the capital: no matter what the situation, no matter how the American aggressors bomb and sabotage, we will ensure smooth transportation. If the U.S. imperialists blow up one Long Bien Bridge, we will build five or six new bridges; if they blow up a section of the road, we will open dozens of kilometers of new roads.

Representative of the militia self-defense team of a certain factory, Wu Huang Bao, said in his speech that the capital militia self-defense team will fight to the end to defend the independence and freedom of the motherland. He said, militia self-defense team members will work harder, fight while producing, and play a leading role in promoting production, people's air defense work, and flood prevention work, together with the people of the whole country, to decisively defeat the American aggressors.
