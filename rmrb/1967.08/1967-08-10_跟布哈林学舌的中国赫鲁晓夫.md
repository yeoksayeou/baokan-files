The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party to the judgment of history. The massive amount of facts exposed by the revolutionary masses show that this Chinese Khrushchev has long been a thoroughgoing opportunist. In his relentless advocacy for the development of the rich peasant economy and opposition to the socialist transformation of agriculture, he has surpassed Bukharin of the Soviet Union.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after the completion of land reform, what policy should be adopted towards the rich peasant economy? Should it be a policy of restriction and gradual elimination, or a policy of protection and encouragement? This is a major issue concerning whether to lead the five hundred million peasants towards socialism or towards capitalism.

On this extremely important issue, the Chinese Khrushchev has completely betrayed the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Like the old opportunist Bukharin, he has become a yes-man and faithful spokesman for the rich peasants.

Bukharin strongly advocated that the rich peasants should be given "less restriction" and more freedom, especially in the freedom of grain trade. The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy is even more programmatic. He is extremely dissatisfied with our Party's policy of restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy. To allow capitalism to freely spread in the countryside, he actively advocates the "four freedoms" (i.e., freedom of land buying and selling, freedom of hiring labor, freedom of usury, and freedom of operation).

Bukharin believed that one should not "be too afraid of hired labor." He attacked the Soviet government for prohibiting rich peasants from "hiring labor," saying that "not only the rich peasants are dissatisfied, but even the poor peasants are dissatisfied." He absurdly claimed that poor peasants "would rather go to the worst scoundrel rich peasants to earn a piece of bread." The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy is even more systematic and theoretical. From the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie and rich peasants, he vigorously spreads the idea that "now exploitation is saving people, not allowing exploitation is dogmatism. Now exploitation is necessary, and exploitation should be welcomed." He also absurdly believes that rich peasants hiring labor to farm "is not exploitation; it increases social wealth." Hiring people to farm can be "unrestricted," "hiring ten or eight or even a hundred is fine," all should be "left to flow freely," but "those who do not allow hiring labor or individual farming should not be left to flow freely."

Bukharin shouted: "To help the poor peasants and middle peasants, the economy of the rich peasants must be developed," "reward various growing capitalist elements," and with the continuous development of the rich peasant economy, "the rich peasants' cooperative nests" can peacefully grow into socialism. The Chinese Khrushchev also parrots Bukharin and makes it more concrete. He promotes the policy of "preserving the rich peasant economy" as a "long-term policy" everywhere. He also preposterously says: the rich peasant economy "is beneficial to the national economy of our country, and thus beneficial to the broad masses of peasants." He believes that only when the proportion of households with "three horses, one plow, and one cart" reaches "eighty percent," can we "then establish collective farms in the future" and enter socialism.

These living facts show that in acting as a faithful servant and dog of the bourgeoisie and rich peasants, in trying to maintain and develop the capitalist front in the countryside, in opposing socialism and opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Chinese Khrushchev has gone even further than Bukharin. The Chinese Khrushchev is even more Bukharin than Bukharin.

The so-called "four freedoms" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, in essence, is to fight for the freedom of the rich peasants to exploit the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, to fight for the freedom of the rich peasants to develop capitalism, and to fight for the freedom of the rich peasants to oppose socialism and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "With the freedom of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, there can be no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited." Is it not clear that the Chinese Khrushchev is a faithful spokesman for the exploiting class?

The Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "not allowing exploitation is dogmatism" is a blatant betrayal of Marxism-Leninism. Like all counter-revolutionary revisionists, he also uses the charge of "dogmatism" to attack Marxism-Leninism. Is it not that Marxism has always held that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful? The Chinese Khrushchev's vigorous spread of the counter-revolutionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is glorious" can only show that he is a shameful traitor to the proletarian revolution.

The Chinese Khrushchev also follows the most reactionary tone of the bourgeoisie's hired scholars, vigorously spreading the reactionary fallacy that rich peasants hiring labor "is not exploitation." According to this counter-revolutionary fallacy, landlords hiring long-term laborers would not be considered exploitation, and capitalists hiring workers would certainly not be considered exploitation. We must ask the Chinese Khrushchev, what is exploitation? Does exploitation still exist in the world? The set of fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev are all the fallacies of vampires and parasites, completely serving to maintain the exploitative system of eating people.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that only when the rich peasant economy has been fully developed can we "then establish collective farms in the future" and enter socialism. The "collective farms" he talks about here are "collective farms" established on the basis of the full development of the rich peasant economy, which can only be genuine capitalist large farms, absolutely not socialist collective farms. The "socialism" he talks about here is "socialism" entered after the full development of the rich peasant economy, which can only be bourgeois dictatorship "socialism," absolutely not proletarian dictatorship socialism. The purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev's relentless spread of this set of counter-revolutionary fallacies, as Stalin pointed out in criticizing Bukharin, is to "preserve the position of individual peasant economy, arm the rich peasants with 'new' theoretical weapons to oppose collective farms, and destroy the position of collective farms," thereby preserving and developing the capitalist position.

We must learn from Lu Xun's thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, and thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, making him infamous for eternity and never able to rise again!

    跟布哈林学舌的中国赫鲁晓夫
    张民
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派推上历史的审判台。广大革命群众揭发出来的大量事实表明，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫早就是彻头彻尾的机会主义者。他在竭力鼓吹发展富农经济、反对农业的社会主义改造方面，比起当年苏联的布哈林来，有过之而无不及。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，特别是土地改革完成后，对富农经济应当采取什么政策？是执行限制和逐步消灭的政策，还是备加保护和鼓励发展的政策？这是关系到把五亿农民引向社会主义还是引向资本主义的大问题。
    在这个极端重要的问题上，中国的赫鲁晓夫完全背弃了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同老机会主义者布哈林一样，成为富农的应声虫和忠实的代言人。
    布哈林极力主张对富农要“少搞一点限制”，多给一点自由，特别是粮食贸易的自由。中国的赫鲁晓夫的主张比布哈林更加纲领化。他对我们党限制和逐步消灭富农经济的政策极为不满。为了让资本主义在农村自由泛滥，他积极提倡“四大自由”（即土地买卖自由、雇工自由、放高利贷自由、经营自由）。
    布哈林认为，不应“过分害怕雇佣劳动”。他攻击苏维埃政权由于禁止富农“雇佣劳动力”，“不仅富农不满意，而且连贫农也不满意”。他胡说贫农“宁愿跑到最坏的恶棍富农那里赚块面包吃”。中国的赫鲁晓夫的主张比布哈林更加系统化，更加理论化。他从资产阶级和富农的反动立场出发，极力散布“现在剥削是救人，不准剥削是教条主义。现在必须剥削，要欢迎剥削”。他还荒谬地认为富农雇工种田“不叫剥削，它增加了社会财富”。雇人种地可以“没有限制”，“雇十个八个甚至一百也好”，都应该“放任自流”，但“对于不让雇工、不让单干的，则不能放任。”
    布哈林叫嚷：“为了帮助贫农和中农，必须发展富裕农户的经济”，“奖励各种增长的资本主义成分”，随着富农经济的不断发展，“富农的合作社窝巢”可以和平地长入社会主义。中国的赫鲁晓夫也跟着布哈林学舌，并更加具体化。他到处推销“保存富农经济的政策”“是一种长期的政策”。他还颠倒黑白地说：富农经济“对于我们国家的人民经济的发展，是有利的，因而对于广大的农民也是有利的。”他认为只有当拥有“三马一犁一车的农户所占的比例”“发展到百分之八十”，“将来才好搞集体农庄”，才能进入社会主义。
    这些活生生的事实说明，在充当资产阶级、富农的忠顺奴才和走狗方面，在力图保持和发展农村的资本主义阵地方面，在反对社会主义、反对无产阶级专政方面，中国的赫鲁晓夫比布哈林走得还要远，中国的赫鲁晓夫比布哈林还要布哈林。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫积极提倡的所谓“四大自由”，说穿了，就是要为富农争得剥削广大贫下中农的自由，就是要为富农争得发展资本主义的自由，就是要为富农争得反对社会主义、反对无产阶级专政的自由。毛主席教导我们：“有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。”中国的赫鲁晓夫是剥削阶级忠实的代言人，难道还不清楚吗？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫关于“不准剥削是教条主义”的谰言，完全是对马克思列宁主义的公然无耻的背叛。同一切反革命修正主义分子一样，他也是用“教条主义”这个罪名来攻击马克思列宁主义。难道马克思主义不是从来就认为劳动光荣、剥削可耻吗？中国的赫鲁晓夫大肆散布“剥削有功”、“剥削光荣”的反革命谬论，只能说明他是无产阶级革命的可耻的叛徒。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫还学着最反动的资产阶级御用学者的腔调，大肆散布富农雇工“不叫剥削”的反动谬论。按照这种反革命的谬论，地主雇佣长工也就不能算作剥削，资本家雇佣工人当然也就不能算作剥削。我们要质问中国的赫鲁晓夫，到底什么才叫剥削？世界上到底还有没有剥削这回事？中国的赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的这一套，统统是吸血鬼和寄生虫的谬论，完全是为维护吃人的剥削制度服务的。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹只有富农经济得到了充分的发展，“将来才好搞集体农庄”，才能进入社会主义。他在这里讲的“集体农庄”，就是在富农经济充分发展的基础上建立起来的“集体农庄”，只能是地地道道的资本主义大农场，绝对不是社会主义的集体农庄。他在这里讲的“社会主义”，就是在富农经济充分发展以后进入的“社会主义”，只能是资产阶级专政的“社会主义”，绝对不是无产阶级专政的社会主义。中国的赫鲁晓夫不遗余力地散布这一套反革命谬论的目的，正如斯大林在批判布哈林时指出的，就是为了“要保持个体农民经济的阵地，用‘新的’理论武器把富农分子武装起来反对集体农庄，破坏集体农庄的阵地”，从而保持并发展资本主义阵地。
    我们一定要学习鲁迅痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批垮、批臭，让他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
