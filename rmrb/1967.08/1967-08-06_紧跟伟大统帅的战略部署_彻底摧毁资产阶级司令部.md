	Broad revolutionary masses, filled with passion, say: Chairman Mao's big-character poster is an extremely great and brilliant Marxist-Leninist document. It is a great cannon that opens a new era in human history, illuminating the path of victory for the Cultural Revolution. It proclaims the end of the day for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They declare that they will unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: In the midst of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the vast revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the people's liberation army's land, sea, and air forces across the country, with the deepest feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, enthusiastically cheer the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters."

	Today, Chairman Mao's great historic big-character poster is published in the newspapers, and the whole country is in a festive mood. In our great capital and across the country, grand celebrations and demonstrations are being held everywhere. The broad revolutionary masses and the people's liberation army fighters, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, hold Chairman Mao's big-character poster and read it over and over again, shouting in thousands of voices: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They say: Chairman Mao's big-character poster points out the direction of struggle for the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and sounds the battle cry to smash the bourgeois headquarters.

	At the celebrations and demonstrations in various places, the broad revolutionary masses and the people's liberation army fighters firmly declare that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's big-character poster, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	In the birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, a grand rally with over a million military and civilian personnel was held today in Tiananmen Square to celebrate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster and to denounce the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, who have usurped the Party, the army, and the government and attempted to restore capitalism.

	From early morning, revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and the people's liberation army's three services revolutionary cadres from the capital, holding high the portraits of the great teacher Chairman Mao and red banners, gathered from all directions to Tiananmen Square and the East and West Chang'an Streets. People shouted over and over again: "Celebrate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster!" "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" "Defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death!"

	Representatives of the revolutionary cadres of the capital's proletariat, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, said at the meeting: Chairman Mao's big-character poster is an extremely great and brilliant Marxist-Leninist document. It is another great cannon that opens a new era in human history. This big-character poster illuminates the path of victory for the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and proclaims the end of the day for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They pointed out that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are still desperately struggling. We revolutionary cadres must unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, focus our targets, concentrate our firepower, and thoroughly criticize and denounce them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, burying them in the vast ocean of people's war. The representatives of the three services' revolutionary cadres emphasized in their speeches that they must thoroughly criticize and denounce the bourgeois reactionary line and bourgeois reactionary military line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and thoroughly eliminate all their poisonous influences to achieve new great victories in the Cultural Revolution.

	The meeting adopted a call to action, issuing a solemn call to all revolutionary cadres in the city: They must closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, further carry out the revolutionary criticism movement, form a vast revolutionary criticism army, and fight a people's war of revolutionary criticism. They must, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. Revolutionary cadres must be models of promoting revolutionary great unity. They must, in the revolutionary criticism, further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and greatly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. In the revolutionary criticism, they must greatly criticize the exploitative class ideology and the bourgeois reactionary line; greatly establish Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	In Wuhan, where the victory songs are constantly being heard, the city is in a festive mood today. The Wuhan region's proletarian revolutionary cadres' headquarters held celebrations in Hankou, Wuchang, Hankou, and Qingshan. The broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and stationed fighters expressed that on the anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster, they must respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," unite the military and the people, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, launch a new high tide of revolutionizing and promoting production, win over and unite the deceived masses, and make the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan even better.

	The warriors of "Steel General" and "Steel 9.13" reviewed the year's struggle and said with passion: Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" pointed out the direction of our struggle, clarified the target of our struggle, gave us support, and bolstered our courage. Every time we think of Chairman Mao, think of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, think of Chairman Mao's big-character poster, our fighting spirit is greater, and our courage is more abundant. Our Wuhan region's proletarian revolutionary cadres are fighting stronger and braver, finally defeating the fierce attacks of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military.

	Revolutionary organizations such as "Steel Second Headquarters," "New Hua Workers," "New Hua Farmers," "New Lake University," and "Three Headquarters Revolutionary Alliance" are all jubilant today. They said with revolutionary enthusiasm: We must closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, "pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dog," further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan.

	The people's liberation army stationed in Wuhan, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses, declared: To defend Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color, they must pursue and attack the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, open fire on them, and open fire more fiercely. They also expressed that they must firmly support the proletarian revolutionary cadres, firmly protect the proletarian revolutionary cadres, unite the military and the people, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	In Shanghai, the birthplace of the "January Revolution" red storm, major streets are covered with big red posters and large banners celebrating the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster. The powerful street big-character poster columns are filled with big-character posters fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Many factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions' proletarian revolutionary cadres held various memorial activities. Revolutionary cultural workers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, went to the streets to perform newly created battle programs.

	The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters called on all comrades to seriously and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's big-character poster, study the editorials published today in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and resolutely repel the frenzied counterattacks of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang against the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

	They must further carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dog," raise the revolutionary criticism movement to a new level, thoroughly bury the bourgeois headquarters, and defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. The broad proletarian revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in Shanghai expressed: They must, through revolutionary criticism, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, greatly criticize bourgeois and revisionist ideology, and greatly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

	The broad fighters of the three services stationed in Shanghai expressed: They must, in the revolutionary criticism, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influences of the bourgeois reactionary line and reactionary military line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, for a long time, eliminate their influences, turn the troops into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, and let our great motherland's red mountains remain unchanged for thousands of years.

	Today, in Harbin, Jinan, Guiyang, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and other places, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of proletarian revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and stationed fighters held grand rallies and parades. In Xining, Hohhot, Qingdao, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Fuzhou, and many other places, the proletarian revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and stationed fighters also held celebrations and discussion meetings. Many proletarian revolutionary cadres in various places, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, said: Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" is a great historic cannon related to the destiny of our country and the future of the world. Chairman Mao's big-character poster is the most magnificent battle poem of the 1960s. The day Chairman Mao published this big-character poster is a revolutionary holiday that will forever be worth recording in the history of the proletarian revolution in our country and the world. Many revolutionary masses reviewed the year's battle journey, re-studied Chairman Mao's big-character poster, and all firmly raised their arms to swear to Chairman Mao: They will be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters! They must resolutely complete the great strategic task proposed by Chairman Mao in the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," push the revolutionary criticism movement to a new high tide, thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, with the Chinese Khrushchev as the representative. They must, in the revolutionary criticism, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, let the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over the whole of China, and forever shine over the whole world!
