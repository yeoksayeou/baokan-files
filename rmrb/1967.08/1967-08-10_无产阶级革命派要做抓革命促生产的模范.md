The proletarian revolutionaries of Jingxi Changgou Coal Mine, after seizing power, have, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, vigorously seized the revolution and promoted production, achieving double victories in both revolution and production.

The proletarian revolutionaries of Changgou Coal Mine have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, combining the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own unit. This has greatly raised the class consciousness of the worker masses and aroused their enthusiasm for labor.

They adhere to the principle of "revolution above ground and production below ground."

They adhere to the principle of making revolution on the spot, making revolution in their spare time, and making revolution through economizing.

They adhere to the principle of not letting differences in views affect production, not engaging in debates during production time, and resolutely not engaging in armed struggles.

They strive to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings and the Party's policies, truly deserving to be exemplars in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

"Seizing the revolution and promoting production" is Chairman Mao's great call. The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao state: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at revolutionizing people's ideology, so as to make all work done better, faster, and more economically." Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, also said: "Do not seize the revolution without promoting production, causing production to stop. Do not engage in production without seizing the revolution, causing the revolution to stop. Both should be carried out simultaneously, and revolution should take the lead in promoting production."

Whether or not we can resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" concerns the construction of Chinese socialism, the lives of urban and rural people, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and the realization of Chairman Mao's great decision of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people. Proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely be exemplars in seizing the revolution and promoting production, with a strong sense of responsibility as masters of the state, pushing the revolution and production to new heights.

We should be like the proletarian revolutionaries of Changgou Coal Mine, always directing the spearhead of struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, making the great criticism of the revolution a powerful driving force for production.

We should be like the proletarian revolutionaries of Changgou Coal Mine, correctly handling contradictions among the people, always putting national interests and class interests first. No matter how great the differences in opinions among mass organizations, they should actively cooperate in production and consciously observe and maintain the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. We must adhere to the correct methods of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and resolutely stop armed struggles.

Implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is a sharp and complex class struggle. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road always try every means to resist and oppose the great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," attempting to sabotage socialist production and resist the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people must heighten their vigilance and resolutely smash the enemy's plots. All those who have been deceived and all cadres who have made mistakes should awaken, resolutely correct their mistakes, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, together with the proletarian revolutionaries, making achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

At present, a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, with the central task of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, is surging across the country. In the midst of the revolutionary criticism, we must actively advance revolutionary great alliances and "three-in-ones," thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our units, and promote the revolutionization of people's ideology; at the same time, we must maintain revolutionary order, muster our greatest efforts, strive to fully and over-fulfill the state's industrial production plan, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture for the whole year.

### 无产阶级革命派要做抓革命促生产的模范

    无产阶级革命派要做抓革命促生产的模范
    京西长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派夺权以后，在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，同本单位的斗批改结合起来，大大提高了工人群众的阶级觉悟，激发了工人群众的劳动积极性。
    他们坚持“上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产”。
    他们坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命。
    他们坚持不因观点分歧影响生产，坚持不在生产时间搞辩论，坚决不搞武斗。
    他们努力按照毛主席的教导，按照党的政策办事，不愧为抓革命，促生产的模范。
    “抓革命，促生产”，是毛主席的伟大号召。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅也说：“不要只抓革命，不促生产，把生产停顿下来。也不要只搞生产，把革命停顿下来。两者应该同时进行，而且应该以革命来带头，来促进生产。”
    能不能坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，关系到我国社会主义建设，关系到城乡人民生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命，关系到支援世界人民的革命斗争，关系到实现毛主席的备战、备荒、为人民的伟大决策。无产阶级革命派要坚决做“抓革命，促生产”的模范，以国家主人翁的高度责任感，把革命和生产推向新高潮。
    我们要象长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派那样，不论在什么情况下，始终把斗争矛头对准以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，使革命的大批判成为推动生产的巨大动力。
    我们要象长沟峪煤矿的无产阶级革命派那样，正确处理人民内部矛盾，不论在什么情况下，都把国家利益、阶级利益放在第一位。群众组织之间，不管有多大的意见分歧，在生产中都要主动搞好协作，自觉地遵守和维护无产阶级的革命纪律。要坚持运用无产阶级文化大革命的正确方法，坚决制止武斗。
    贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，总是千方百计地抵制和反对“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，妄图破坏社会主义生产，对抗无产阶级文化大革命。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要提高警惕，坚决粉碎敌人的阴谋。一切受蒙蔽的群众，和犯错误的干部，应该猛醒，坚决改正错误，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，和无产阶级革命派一起，在抓革命，促生产中立下功劳。
    当前，一个以彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部为中心任务的革命大批判的新高潮正在全国兴起。我们要在革命的大批判中，积极地推进革命的大联合和“三结合”，切实搞好本单位的斗批改，促进人的思想革命化；同时，要维护革命的秩序，要鼓足最大的干劲，力争全面完成和超额完成国家工业生产计划，力争全年农业大丰收。
