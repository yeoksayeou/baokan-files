The flames of the Indian people's struggle against tyranny and hunger are burning furiously. In West Bengal and Kerala, the masses have risen up to fight against oppression and hunger, and have used violence to resist the police's bloody suppression. The revisionist communists in the governments of these two states have boasted in the past that they could use their state power to benefit the people; they also promised not to use the police to suppress the people's struggles. Now, a large amount of evidence proves that they were merely lying.

By the 12th, the people's anti-tyranny and anti-hunger demonstrations in various parts of West Bengal had entered their sixth day. They bravely resisted police harassment, attacked reactionary government agencies. Thousands of demonstrators squatted on the railway tracks, causing the entire state's railway traffic to come to a halt.

In Nabadvip, a town about 100 kilometers north of the West Bengal capital of Calcutta, due to the fact that no grain could be bought in the market for several days in a row, more than a thousand hungry masses expressed their anger to the reactionary government on the 10th and set fire to government agencies.

On the 11th, the masses continued their anti-hunger demonstrations. They surrounded the district magistrate and forced him to stand in the district government for four hours. They also surrounded the police station. At the same time, the hungry farmers in the vicinity of this town also rose up to attack reactionary government agencies, intercept trains, and cars on the road.

On the 12th, the masses' fighting spirit was even more ardent. To prevent the Indian reactionaries from bringing in military and police from outside to carry out bloody suppression, they cut off telephone lines and railway lines, and hid the ferries on the river. They also built barricades and used stones and other weapons to repel the reactionary police's attacks. The reactionary police opened fire on the masses, killing four and injuring about thirty.

It is reported that of the 36 million people in West Bengal, about 20 million have been virtually without food for several weeks. They are forced to fill their stomachs with grass roots and wild fruits. The West Bengal government is completely unable to solve the food shortage problem. It knows full well that the central government has no food, but in order to get by, it has the chief minister call the prime minister Indira Gandhi to request food, and Indira Gandhi played a trick, saying vaguely, "will do its best to meet" West Bengal's food needs, trying to brush it off.

In Kerala, the mass struggle against tyranny and hunger has been going on for about half a month. On August 7, the masses held a large-scale demonstration in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram. Most of the students in the schools went on strike and participated in the demonstration. They stopped some of the state government's ministers' cars. On the 11th, the demonstrators in Thiruvananthapuram burned the effigies of the state chief minister, the revisionist communist leader Nambudiripad, and the state food minister, the Danji group member Thomas. The state government sent police to the station to violently suppress the participating masses.

    喀拉拉邦群众愤怒焚烧印度官员和印共修正主义头目人像
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度西孟加拉邦和喀拉拉邦人民最近奋起开展反暴政、反饥饿斗争，并且用暴力反抗警察的血腥镇压。在这两个邦政府中当官的印共修正主义分子，过去吹嘘他们能够利用邦政权为人民谋福利；他们还保证不动用警察去镇压人民斗争。现在，大量事实证明他们只不过是在撒谎。
    到十二日为止，西孟加拉邦各地人民的反暴政、反饥饿示威已进入第六天。他们奋勇抵抗警察的迫害，袭击反动政府机关。几千名示威者蹲在铁道上，使整个邦的铁道交通中断。
    在西孟加拉邦首府加尔各答以北大约一百公里的纳巴德维普镇，由于市场上一连几天买不到粮食，一千多名饥饿的群众十日愤怒地向反动政府表示抗议，并且放火焚烧政府机关。
    十一日，群众继续进行反饥饿示威。他们包围了县官，罚他在县政府里站了四个钟头。他们还包围警察局。同时，这个市镇附近的饥饿的农民也纷纷起来袭击反动政府机关，拦截火车和公路上的汽车。
    十二日，群众的斗志更加昂扬，他们为了防止印度反动派从外地调去军警进行血腥镇压，切断了电话线和铁道线，把河上的渡船藏起来。他们还筑起了街垒，用石块等做武器打退反动警察的进攻。反动警察向群众开枪，打死四人，打伤约三十人。
    据报道，西孟加拉邦三千六百万人中大约有两千多万人几个星期来实际上没有粮食吃，他们被迫以草根和野果充饥。西孟加拉邦政府根本无法解决粮荒问题，它明知道中央政府也没有粮食，但是为了应付差使，就由邦首席部长打电话给总理英迪拉·甘地要求拨给粮食，而英迪拉·甘地耍了个花招，她含糊其词地说，“将尽力满足”西孟加拉邦的粮食需要，企图搪塞过去。
    在喀拉拉邦，群众性的反暴政、反饥饿斗争已经开展了大约半个月。八月七日，群众在邦首府特里凡德琅举行大规模示威。大部分学校的学生举行罢课，参加示威。他们拦住了邦政府的一些部长的汽车。十一日，特里凡德琅的示威群众焚烧了邦首席部长、印共修正主义头目南布迪里巴德和邦粮食部长、丹吉集团分子托马斯的假人像。邦政府派警察到车站用暴力镇压参加斗争的群众。
