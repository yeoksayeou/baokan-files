At the decisive moment when the Soviet revisionists, led by Khrushchev, were bombarding China with their guns, a new triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resounded through the clouds over a certain place in Guangxi.

On the 21st of this month, suddenly the alarm bells rang, and the soldiers and officers of a certain air force unit swiftly took up their battle positions. The commander calmly and firmly issued the order: "Give it your all, annihilate the invading enemy." The soldiers responded in unison: "Firmly carry out the highest directive."

The American air bandits, guilty and cowardly, used the clouds for cover and flew in a zigzag pattern after entering our airspace, attempting to escape the just punishment. However, our air force soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were clear-eyed and quickly spotted two gray, sneaky enemy planes. Kang Zhensheng, Chen Fengyun, and their comrades stared intently at the enemy planes. The commander transmitted another quote from Chairman Mao: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The soldiers encouraged each other: "Hit them hard!"

"Defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve new victories for the people!" At the same time, local militiamen, armed with guns, hid in the hills and forests, ready to capture the air bandits.

In an instant, one of the enemy planes was hit. The pilot, who was working for the Wall Street bosses, had to quickly bail out to save his life. Immediately after, another enemy plane was heavily struck, smoking and on fire. The pilot on board didn't have time to bail out and crashed into the hillside along with the plane.

When parachutes began to drift down from the sky, male and female militiamen, Red Guards, and poor and lower-middle peasants surrounded the captured American pilot. The lucky survivor was pale and trembling, begging for mercy. In front of the heroic Chinese people, the true weakness of American imperialism was fully exposed.

The angry crowd shouted in unison: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" The revolutionary masses pointed at the American bandit, warning American imperialism: The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible. If American imperialism dares to expand its aggressive war to China, whether it comes from the sky or the ground, it will meet its end, drowned in the vast ocean of people's war.

The joyous news of completely annihilating the American bandit aircraft and capturing the American pilot quickly spread to the villages and towns of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The people of all ethnic groups were overjoyed, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with all their hearts, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    为人民立新功
    ——我英雄的空军某部击落美国强盗飞机纪实
    在万炮齐轰中国的赫鲁晓夫的决胜时刻，在广西某地，又一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌响彻云霄。
    二十一日中午，忽然警报骤响，空军某部指战员们闪电般地投入各自的战斗岗位，指挥员沉着有力地下达命令：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌。”战士们异口同声地回答：坚决执行最高指示。
    美国空中强盗作贼心虚，侵入我领空后即利用云层进行蛇形活动，企图逃脱正义的惩罚。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我空军战士，心明眼亮，他们很快地就发现两架灰溜溜的贼机。康振生、陈丰云和他的战友们，目不转睛地狠狠地盯着敌机。指挥员又一次传来毛主席语录：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。战士们互相鼓励：“狠狠地打！”
  “保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为人民立新功！”与此同时，当地民兵荷枪实弹，分散隐蔽在山岗上、丛林里，准备捉拿飞贼。
    刹时间，一架贼机被击中，为华尔街老板卖命的飞贼，只得赶忙跳伞逃命；紧接着另一架贼机，也遭到了沉重的打击，冒烟起火，机上的送死鬼，来不及跳伞，就随着飞机一头撞碎在山岗上。
    当空中有降落伞飘落下来时，男女民兵、红卫兵小将和贫下中农社员，立即把落地的一名美国飞贼重重包围起来。侥幸活着的这个飞贼，吓得脸色苍白，浑身发抖，举手求饶。在英雄的中国人民面前，完全暴露了美帝国主义纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    愤怒的群众同声地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”广大革命群众指着这个美国强盗，警告美帝国主义：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军是无敌于天下的。美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争扩大到中国，不管它是从天上来，还是从地上来，都叫它有来无回，淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海中。
    全歼美国强盗飞机、活捉美国飞贼的喜讯，迅速传到广西壮族自治区的山村和城镇，当地各族人民一片欢腾，纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》，热烈欢呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
