The people's armed forces department in Zigong, Sichuan Province, has shown unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in the struggle to support the left. They have stood firm and clear in their stance, demonstrating absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao. Despite the various tactics of suppression and persecution employed by the bourgeois reactionary line, they have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions and steadfastly supported the revolutionary leftists. They have firmly resisted and opposed the so-called "directives" of the old Zigong Municipal Committee that do not align with Mao Zedong Thought. They have withstood the test of the turbulent waves of class struggle and made significant contributions to the local proletarian cultural revolution. They are truly the "Red Armed Forces Department of Chairman Mao" praised by the masses and a model for all people's armed forces personnel and military comrades nationwide to learn from.

The experience of Zigong's people's armed forces department in their victorious struggle can be summed up in one point: unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. This is the fundamental principle for doing support-left work and for carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao has long pointed out: "This proletarian cultural revolution is led by our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the great commander's command, we must listen well to our commander—Chairman Mao. The cultural revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!"

In the proletarian cultural revolution and in the struggle to support the left, unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, listening well to Chairman Mao, resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and acting under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters are matters of political direction and our fundamental stance and attitude. If the direction is correct, everything else will fall into place. If the direction is wrong, everything else will be wrong.

The proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented new thing. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. It is inevitable that we may not fully understand some issues. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao means doing as Chairman Mao says and doing as Chairman Mao does. For instructions from Chairman Mao, we execute those we understand and also execute those we temporarily do not understand; we execute those that align with our own thoughts and also execute those that do not align with our own thoughts. The comrades in Zigong's people's armed forces department said it well: Chairman Mao's leadership is correct a thousand times over, ten thousand times over. If we do not understand, it is because our stance, viewpoints, and methods are problematic. The more such times there are, the more we must believe without doubt, follow closely, and carry out his instructions. "Only by following closely can we understand; only by carrying out his instructions can we deepen our understanding in practice."

In the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and following Chairman Mao in the revolution will inevitably face opposition from class enemies and conservative forces. Can we act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? This is a major test for every revolutionary comrade. Only by being selfless can we be fearless. Only by eliminating all selfish thoughts and regarding revolutionary interests as our first priority, like the comrades in Zigong's people's armed forces department, can we truly become warriors who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao said: "Making mistakes is inevitable, but as long as we correct them sincerely, it will be fine." In this sharp and complex class struggle of the proletarian cultural revolution, some of our comrades, due to various reasons, have said some wrong things and done some wrong deeds, which is understandable. As long as mistakes are admitted frankly and corrected thoroughly as soon as possible, it is acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and remaining a good comrade loyal to Chairman Mao.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories. At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow the great Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and closely follow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to achieve new victories in the proletarian cultural revolution!

### 无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席

    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席
    四川省自贡市人民武装部在支左斗争中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席的绝对忠诚。他们不顾资产阶级反动路线软硬兼施的种种打击和迫害，坚决执行毛主席的指示，坚定不移地支持革命左派。他们对旧自贡市委的不符合毛泽东思想的所谓“指示”，坚决抵制，坚决反对。他们经受住了阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪的考验，为当地无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大贡献。他们不愧为广大群众所称颂的“毛主席的红色武装部”。他们是全国人民武装干部和全军同志学习的好榜样。
    自贡市人民武装部斗争胜利的经验，归结到一点，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。这是做好支左工作的根本，也是搞好无产阶级文化大革命的根本。
    林彪同志早就指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，在支左斗争中，无限忠于毛主席，好好听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一切行动听毛主席的无产阶级司令部的指挥，是政治方向的问题，是我们的根本立场和根本态度。方向对头了，一切事情才好办。方向错了，一切就都错了。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是史无前例的崭新的事物。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰。有些问题，我们暂时不很理解，这是难免的。无限忠于毛主席，就是要做到“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做”，“毛主席怎么做，我们也跟着怎么做”。对毛主席的指示，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行；同自己想法一致的坚决执行，同自己想法不一致的也坚决执行。自贡市人民武装部的同志们说得好：毛主席的领导一千个正确，一万个正确。我们如果不理解，那是自己的立场、观点、方法有问题。越是在这种时候，我们越是要坚信不疑，紧紧跟上，坚决照办。“只有紧跟，才能理解；只有照办，才能在实践中加深理解。”
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧紧跟着毛主席干革命，必然要遭到阶级敌人和保守势力的反对。能不能坚定不移地按照毛泽东思想办事，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对我们每个革命同志，是一个重大考验。无私才能无畏。只有破除一切私心杂念，以革命利益为第一生命，象自贡市人民武装部的同志们那样，“牢可坐，头可断，坚信毛主席的红心永不变”，才能真正成为无限忠于毛主席的战士。
    毛主席说：“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。”在无产阶级文化大革命这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们有些同志，由于种种原因，说了些错话，做了些错事，这是可以理解的。犯了错误只要痛痛快快地承认，尽快地彻底改正，就是照毛主席的指示办事，就仍然是一个忠于毛主席的好同志。
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的人民军队。伟大的毛泽东思想是我军一切胜利的源泉。在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟伟大的毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利！
