The so-called "International Preparatory Conference," the "Tokyo General Meeting," and the "Hiroshima and Nagasaki Conferences" organized by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon Miyamoto have all concluded after a ten-day session on September 9. This conference, under the banner of "complete prohibition of nuclear weapons," was actually a platform to promote the so-called "united action," serving the line of surrender and betrayal advocated by the Japanese revisionists, aligning with the Soviet Union, flattering the United States, and opposing China.

To usurp the honor of previous "World Conferences to Ban the Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" and to deceive the Japanese people, the Miyamoto group forcibly labeled this conference as the "13th World Conference to Ban the Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs." However, the World Conference, which has a glorious tradition of opposing American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, was already split by the Miyamoto group last year. During the 12th World Conference held in 1966, the Miyamoto group imposed its line of aligning with the Soviet Union, flattering the United States, and opposing China on the World Conference. Therefore, foreign representatives and Japanese left-wing representatives who upheld the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist tradition of the conference were forced to withdraw. This year's conference is not the "13th World Conference" at all but a continuation of last year's split conference advocating alignment with the Soviet Union and opposition to China.

The number of foreign representatives attending this conference was less than one-fifth of that of the 11th World Conference before the split. The number of Japanese representatives attending was also far fewer than in the past. Despite the Miyamoto group's efforts to mobilize people, the actual number of attendees did not reach half of the planned number. Some mass organizations flatly refused to participate in this conference organized by the Japanese revisionists. These facts show that the Miyamoto group's despicable actions of using the split conference to promote the revisionist line have been resisted by the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of the world.

The congratulatory message from Yasaburo Nosaka, the leader of the Japanese revisionists, to the conference, was actually setting the tone for the conference. Nosaka did not mention in his message the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and American imperialism in splitting the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, nor did he mention "opposing revisionism." Thus, he once again publicly betrayed the revolutionary line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism that the World Conference had consistently followed. At the same time, Nosaka's message also vigorously advocated "united action" with the Soviet Union, the chief accomplice of American imperialism, on the Vietnam issue.

The report by Hidenori Hatake, a representative of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and the report by Yoshitaro Hirano, the leader of the Japanese delegation, to the conference were both revisionist goods from the Miyamoto group. They used the Miyamoto group's hackneyed phrases such as "united action" and "independence and self-reliance" in their reports to defend the crimes of the Japanese revisionists in colluding with the Soviet revisionists to betray the revolutionary interests of the Japanese and world people. Hatake did not dare to expose in his report the evil collusion between American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists in using "bombing for peace" and "peaceful coercion" to betray the Vietnamese people, nor did he dare to expose the Soviet revisionists' great betrayal of the Arab people on the Middle East issue. He absurdly claimed that "the war and aggression policies of the United States in various parts of the world are due to the disunity of international peace and democratic forces," thus exonerating the crimes of American imperialism's expansion of aggression and the crimes of the Soviet revisionists' betrayal.

Furthermore, the Miyamoto group also promoted the revisionist line of "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful transition" at this conference. The "Report of the International Preparatory Conference" drafted by some revisionists deliberately obscured the armed struggles of the people in countries such as Burma, India, and Thailand. When some foreign representatives strongly objected, the Japanese revisionists, after consulting with their leader Kyuemon Miyamoto, continued to stubbornly refuse to express support for the armed struggles of the people in these Asian countries and also refused to include any sentences related to "revolutionary violence" in the report.

The despicable actions of the Miyamoto group exposed their reactionary faces to some of the honest representatives present. A local representative, Yamazaki, who has participated in the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs since the first World Conference in 1955, told a reporter from the Oriental News Agency after the conference that the true intention of Miyamoto and others on the Vietnam issue was to collude with the Soviet revisionists to engage in some "united action," betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation. Obviously, the more the Miyamoto group engages in betraying the interests of the Japanese and world people, the more isolated it will become and the faster it will be thrown into the dustbin of history.

    彻底背叛反帝反修革命路线　积极推行联苏媚美反华政策
    宫本集团利用禁核分裂会议大搞叛卖活动
    日修投降路线遭到日本和世界革命人民抵制，出席会议者寥寥无几
    新华社东京十日电  由日共宫本显治修正主义集团操纵的所谓禁止原子弹氢弹会议，在举行了国际预备会议、东京全体会议和广岛、长崎大会后，已在九日收场。这次十天的会议，打着“全面禁止核武器”的招牌，实际上是推销所谓“联合行动”的黑货，使会议为日修的联苏反华、投降叛卖路线服务。
    宫本集团为了窃取历届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的荣誉和欺骗日本人民，硬把它操纵的这次会议叫作“第十三届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”。但是，有着反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义光荣传统的世界大会，早已在去年被宫本集团所分裂。一九六六年召开第十二届世界大会时，宫本集团把它的联苏媚美反华路线强加于世界大会。因此，维护大会反帝反修传统的外国代表和日本左派代表被迫退出大会。今年召开的，根本不是什么“十三届世界大会”，而是去年的联苏反华的分裂会议的继续。
    参加这次会议的外国代表，人数还不及未被分裂以前的第十一届世界大会的五分之一。参加会议的日本代表人数，也无法同过去相比。尽管宫本集团费了九牛二虎之力派人拉伕，但实到人数还达不到计划的一半。有些群众团体干脆声明拒绝参加日修所主办的这次会议。这些事实表明，宫本集团利用分裂会议推行修正主义路线的丑恶行径，遭到了日本人民和世界革命人民的抵制。
    日修头目野坂参三给会议的“贺词”，实际上是为会议定调子。野坂在“贺词”中只字不提苏修勾结美帝、分裂禁止原子弹氢弹运动，只字不提“反对修正主义”，从而又一次公开背叛了过去世界大会一贯执行的反帝必须反修的革命路线。同时，野坂在“贺词”中又大肆鼓吹在越南问题上同美帝头号帮凶苏修搞“联合行动”。
    日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的代表畑中政春向会议提出的“总报告”和日本代表团团长平野义太郎在会上所作的“报告”，都是宫本集团的修正主义货色。他们在报告中使用了宫本集团的“联合行动”和“独立自主”等陈词滥调，为日修同苏修紧密勾结出卖日本和世界人民的革命利益的罪行进行诡辩。畑中在他的“总报告”中，根本不敢揭露美帝和苏修合谋用“以炸迫和”和“以和诱降”的办法出卖越南人民的罪恶勾当，也根本不敢揭露苏修在中东问题上对阿拉伯人民的大叛卖。他胡说什么“美国在世界各地的战争和侵略政策，是利用了国际和平民主力量的不团结”，这样既替美帝国主义扩大侵略的罪行开脱，又替苏修的叛卖罪行开脱。
    不仅如此，宫本集团还在这次会议上推行“和平共处”与“和平过渡”的修正主义路线。由一些修正主义分子共同草拟的“国际预备会议报告”中，竟然故意抹煞了缅甸、印度、泰国等国家的人民武装斗争。当有的外国代表强烈提出意见时，日修分子在当面请示了他们的头目宫本显治后，继续顽固地拒不表示支持这些亚洲国家的人民武装斗争，还拒绝在这个报告中写上有关“革命的暴力”的词句。
    宫本集团的这些卑鄙行径，在到会的一些正直的代表面前暴露了它的反动嘴脸。一位从一九五五年第一届世界大会起一直参加日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的地方代表山崎，在会后对东方通讯社记者发表谈话说，宫本等人在越南问题上的真正意图，是同苏修勾结搞什么“联合行动”，出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争。很明显，宫本集团干出更多叛卖日本和世界人民利益的勾当，就将更加孤立，更快地滚入历史的垃圾堆。
