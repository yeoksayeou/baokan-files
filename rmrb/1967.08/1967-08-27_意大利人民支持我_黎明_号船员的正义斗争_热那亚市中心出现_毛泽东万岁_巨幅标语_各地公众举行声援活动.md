	Italian people support the just struggle of the crew of our "Dawn" ship.
	In Genoa city center, a giant banner reading "Long Live Mao Zedong" appears.
	Publics in various places hold supportive activities.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th: A message from Rome: The entire crew of our country's "Dawn" cargo ship, which has been steadfastly fighting against the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities in the port of Genoa, has received widespread support from the Italian people.

	When the Chinese "Dawn" cargo ship arrived in the port of Genoa on the 13th, following the political provocation by the Italian authorities against the Chinese "Songjiang" and "Friendship" cargo ships in Venice in late July, they once again interfered with the Chinese crew's hanging of Chairman Mao's quotations and banners expressing friendship between the peoples of China and Italy on their own ship. In response to this new political provocation by the Italian side, the Chinese crew engaged in a resolute struggle. The Italian authorities, however, took fascist measures, dispatching military police to surround the "Dawn" cargo ship from August 13th to the present, refusing to supply the crew with fresh water and food.

	The fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities have aroused strong indignation among the Italian people.

	In recent days, the public in Genoa and some other places in Italy have held various activities to support the just struggle of the Chinese crew and to protest against the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities against the Chinese crew. In the urban and suburban areas of Genoa, the Italian public has continuously held rallies to support the Chinese crew. Many Italian masses, despite the interference and obstruction by the military police, have rushed to the entrance of the port dock to show their respect and support for the Chinese crew by waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Chinese crew also waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the deck, shouted friendly slogans, sang "The Internationale," and paid tribute to their Italian friends.

	On the 23rd, a giant banner over four meters long and nearly one and a half meters high appeared in the center of Genoa, with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong" in large red letters. This giant banner expressed the Italian people's support for the just struggle of the Chinese crew, attracting the attention and praise of countless passersby.

	In recent days, the Italian public has also handed over many telegrams of support for the Chinese crew and telegrams of protest against the Italian government to the Chinese Commercial Representative Office in Italy and the relevant Italian authorities.

    意大利人民支持我“黎明”号船员的正义斗争
    热那亚市中心出现“毛泽东万岁”巨幅标语　各地公众举行声援活动
    据新华社二十五日讯  罗马消息：在热那亚港口坚持同意大利当局法西斯暴行进行斗争的我国“黎明”号货轮全体船员，得到意大利人民广泛的支持。
    中国“黎明”号货轮在十三日到达热那亚港时，意大利当局继七月下旬在威尼斯港对中国“松江”和“友好”号货轮进行政治挑衅后，又一次对中国船员在自己船上悬挂毛主席语录和悬挂表示中、意两国人民友好的标语横加干涉。对于意方这种新的政治挑衅，中国船员进行了针锋相对的斗争。意大利当局竟然采取法西斯手段，从八月十三日到现在一直派军警包围“黎明”号货轮，拒不供应船员淡水和食物等物资。
    意当局这种法西斯暴行激起了意大利人民强烈的愤怒。
    最近几天中，热那亚市和意大利一些地方的公众举行了各种活动，声援中国船员的正义斗争，抗议意大利当局对中国船员的法西斯暴行。在热那亚市区和郊区，意大利公众不断举行声援中国船员的集会。许多意大利群众还不顾军警的干涉阻挠，涌到港口码头的入口处，向中国船员挥动《毛主席语录》表示敬意和支持。中国船员也在甲板上挥动《毛主席语录》，高呼友好口号，高唱国际歌，向意大利朋友致敬。
    二十三日在热那亚市中心出现了一幅四米多长、将近一点五米高的巨幅标语，上面写着“毛泽东万岁”的大红字。这条巨幅标语表达了意大利人民对中国船员的正义斗争的支持，引起了街头无数群众的注意和赞扬。
    几天来，意大利公众还把许多对中国船员的声援电报和对意大利政府的抗议电报交给中国驻意大利商务代表处和意大利有关当局。
