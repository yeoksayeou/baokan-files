	“Though we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, we are as close as neighbors.” The peoples of China and Algeria, though separated by vast distances, have hearts that are united. We are your genuine friends and comrades. You are our genuine friends and comrades. Neither of us are the kind of false friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous at heart, nor are we two-faced. The revolutionary and fighting friendship between us has withstood the test of storms and tempests.
