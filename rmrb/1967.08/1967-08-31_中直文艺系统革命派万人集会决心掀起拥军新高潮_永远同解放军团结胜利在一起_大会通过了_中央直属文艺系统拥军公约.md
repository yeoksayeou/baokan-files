The revolutionary fighters of the Central Cultural System, numbering over ten thousand, who are advancing bravely in the midst of the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people." With the deepest class sentiments for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, they gathered today in Tiananmen Square despite the rain to hold a rally, determined to launch a new wave of military support. After the rally, the cultural fighters went to the leadership organs of the Beijing-based troops to give a splendid performance in honor of the army.

The great call by Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people" is a strategic slogan for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. The revolutionary cultural fighters in the capital deeply understand that every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is closely linked with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At today's rally, the cultural fighters waved red flags and beat drums, each one beaming with joy as if celebrating a festival. They expressed their determination to learn better from the army, firmly support the army's "three supports and two militaries" work, and stand together, fight together, and win together with the army. They are determined to further carry out the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The rally adopted a letter of greeting to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All revolutionary fighters of the Central Cultural System expressed in their letter of greeting their deepest feelings and most enthusiastic words, warmly praising the unprecedented great achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The rally also adopted the "Central Cultural System Military Support Pact." All revolutionary cultural fighters expressed their determination to implement the pact, to trust the People's Liberation Army without limit, firmly support the People's Liberation Army, and forever rely on the People's Liberation Army, and strive to learn from the People's Liberation Army.

After the rally, the revolutionary fighters of the Central Cultural System went in four groups to the General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery leadership organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the leadership organs of the Beijing-based troops and Beijing Garrison Command, to give performances in honor of the army. Wherever the revolutionary cultural fighters went, they were warmly welcomed by the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Each unit held a warm welcome rally for the arrival of the performance team. At these welcome rallies, the revolutionary cultural fighters presented letters of greeting filled with enthusiasm to the sons and daughters of the people, expressing their respect for the sons and daughters of the people. The People's Liberation Army also presented gold-embossed Mao badges and frames with the latest inscriptions by Vice Chairman Lin Biao to the cultural fighters who came to give performances in honor of the army.
