The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, who are engaged in the anti-American national salvation revolutionary war, have creatively applied Chairman Mao's theory and strategy of people's war, and have beaten the self-proclaimed strongest imperialist, American imperialism, into a state of disarray and humiliation. They have set a new brilliant example for all oppressed peoples of the world to rely on people's war to defeat invaders.

Using People's War to Defeat American Imperialism

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that only people's war can defeat the enemy of the nation. Comrade Lin Biao said: "The oppressed people can defeat American imperialism through people's war. The most convincing example at present is in Vietnam." The anti-American national salvation revolutionary war of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam is precisely such a genuine people's war.

Since 1965, when American imperialism sent a large number of troops to South Vietnam and launched a local war, it has used all modern weapons except atomic bombs and has deployed its so-called "elite" "ace" troops. However, the results of its confrontation with the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have been nothing but disastrous defeats. In more than two years, it has suffered nearly 200,000 casualties. In the so-called second "dry season strategic counteroffensive" it launched last winter and this spring, it was wiped out by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam by 70,000 men.

Currently, American imperialism has directly deployed more than 460,000 troops to the South Vietnamese battlefield, exceeding the total number of American troops in the Korean War. It has used half of its tactical air force, and has also indirectly deployed more than 70,000 troops from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, as well as about 100,000 American troops stationed in Guam, Okinawa, Thailand, and other places. However, in South Vietnam, which has an area of only 170,000 square kilometers, the people's armed forces have actually tied down about 700,000 American troops, forcing American imperialism to weaken its control over various parts of the world and disrupting its counter-revolutionary global strategic military deployment.

With only 14 million people, South Vietnam, by persisting in people's war, is defeating the number one imperialism with 200 million people. This is a marvel in the history of war, a great feat of the Vietnamese nation, and a magnificent deed that all revolutionary peoples of the world enthusiastically hail.

Building a Genuine People's Army

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." It is precisely because the people of South Vietnam have built a genuine people's armed force that they have been able to defeat the strong enemy time and time again in arduous struggles and achieve one victory after another.

From 1954, when the Geneva Agreement was signed, to 1959, the people of South Vietnam, who had no army of their own, suffered brutal suppression and massacre by American imperialism and its lackeys. In just a few years, tens of thousands of former anti-war fighters and patriotic residents were killed and maimed, and tens of thousands more were imprisoned. To gain freedom, independence, and national reunification, the people of South Vietnam could no longer bear it. Starting in 1959, they rose up in arms, organizing self-defense teams and guerrilla units with sticks, bamboo spears, bows and arrows, and homemade guns to resist the enemy. In February 1961, as the situation developed, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam unified the local people's armed forces into the Liberation Armed Forces. Since then, under the leadership of the Vietnamese People's Revolutionary Party and the National Liberation Front, the Liberation Armed Forces have held high the great banner of people's war and fought even more bravely against the American puppet regime.

The Liberation Armed Forces come from the people and are loyal to the people, establishing a flesh-and-blood bond with the people. They fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to wage war. They fight for a just cause, and although they are outnumbered and outgunned, they fight bravely and tenaciously, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy. In recent years, they have not only defeated the "special war" waged by the United States, which provided money and weapons and used South Vietnamese puppets as soldiers, eliminating about 500,000 enemy troops from 1961 to the end of 1964; they are also defeating the local war waged by the American invaders themselves. Due to the growth and strengthening of the Liberation Armed Forces in the battle, they have now developed into a powerful people's army consisting of main force units, local forces, and guerrilla units. In 1964, the Liberation Armed Forces were able to annihilate an entire puppet army battalion in a single battle or engagement. Since 1965, the Liberation Armed Forces have not only been able to annihilate entire puppet army battalions and regiments but have also been able to annihilate entire American invasion army battalions. In just the first three months of this year, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated 32 enemy battalions, including 22 American battalions. They have beaten the American aggressors' boasted "elite" and "ace" troops into a state of disarray and terror.

Implementing the Strategy and Tactics of People's War

Our great leader Chairman Mao, when discussing the strategy and tactics of people's war, summed it up in four sentences: "You fight your way, I fight mine; when you can win, fight; when you can't win, retreat."

The military and civilian people of South Vietnam have creatively applied this strategy and tactics of people's war, using their strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, putting the enemy in a passive and defensive position.

They have widely launched guerrilla warfare, igniting the flames of anti-aggression war everywhere, while not neglecting mobile warfare under favorable conditions to annihilate the enemy. They have created ingenious methods such as mine warfare, tunnel warfare, water guerrilla warfare, and surprise attacks. As soon as the American puppet forces invade the liberated areas, they immediately fall into the people's war net; within the liberated areas, men, women, and children all join the battle, fighting individually and by village, making the enemy helpless. The enemy's "helicopter tactics" and "armored vehicle tactics" have all failed, unable to exploit their advantages. The enemy cannot find and strike the Liberation Armed Forces, but is constantly being attacked. In recent years, the Liberation Armed Forces have frequently sent elite units deep into the enemy's heartland and important bases to launch surprise attacks, striking fear into the enemy's hearts. In just the past two years, the Liberation Armed Forces have launched nearly 120 attacks on 45 U.S. air bases in South Vietnam, destroying or damaging nearly 3,000 enemy aircraft inside the bases. The transportation lines controlled by the American puppet regime are also constantly being sabotaged and cut off by the guerrillas, causing traffic to frequently come to a standstill. In the face of the Liberation Armed Forces' flexible strategy and tactics, the American puppet forces, who are enemies of the people, are always beaten into a state of confusion and helplessness.

Building the Countryside into a Solid Base Area

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "...We must turn the backward countryside into an advanced and solid base area, into a great revolutionary stronghold in terms of military, political, economic, and cultural affairs, so as to counter the vicious enemy who uses the cities to attack the rural areas, and to gradually achieve the complete victory of the revolution in the long-term struggle." The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, in order to defeat the powerful enemy and achieve the final victory, are doing just that.

The military and civilian people of South Vietnam have not only established revolutionary base areas in the mountainous and forested regions but have also advanced into densely populated, riverine, and heavily guarded enemy areas and transportation lines, establishing many guerrilla zones in these places. After several years of fighting, the liberated areas in South Vietnam have grown from small to large and gradually connected into one piece. In the heartland of the American puppet regime, the West Saigon-Jia Ding area, the liberated areas established by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam are only eight kilometers away from Saigon; in the port of Da Nang, which is guarded by tens of thousands of American troops, the liberated areas have already extended to its doorstep. Now, from the northern part of South Vietnam near the 17th parallel, through the vast Central Highlands and central coastal regions, to the fertile southern plains, four-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population of the entire South Vietnam have been liberated, forming a favorable situation of surrounding the cities with the countryside.

Within the vast liberated areas, the people have taken control and established their own government institutions. The liberated peasants are following the collective production path indicated by the National Liberation Front, establishing mutual aid teams and cooperatives, fighting and defending the liberated areas while actively increasing grain production to support the front lines. The cultural and educational undertakings in the liberated areas are also thriving. As the liberated areas continue to expand and consolidate, and as millions of people have been mobilized and organized, the liberated areas have become a reliable support for waging people's war against the American aggressors and their lackeys. They provide a solid foundation of manpower and material resources for the long-term struggle and for achieving the final victory. In the battle to counter the American aggressors' second "dry season offensive" last winter and this spring, tens of thousands of young men and women from various liberated areas joined the support activities on the front lines, and a large number of young people enthusiastically joined the army and guerrilla units. In the face of the expanding and consolidating liberated areas and the favorable situation of surrounding the cities with the countryside, the American puppet regime is in a state of panic and anxiety, facing the prospect of final doom.

Ironclad facts have proven that the power of the people of South Vietnam is boundless. They can fight generation after generation on their own land, while the vast American imperialism has no power to drag on in the South Vietnamese battlefield. The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam have, with their victorious battle practices, provided rich experience for the oppressed nations and peoples of the world that people's war can defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam will surely hold high the banner of people's war, never let go of the American aggressors, fight a protracted war with them, wear them down and kill them, and achieve the final and thorough victory of the anti-American national salvation war.

### 南越人民树立了人民战争新的光辉榜样

    创造性地运用毛主席人民战争思想把美帝打得狼狈不堪
    南越人民树立了人民战争新的光辉榜样
    两年来南越人民歼灭美军近二十万，牵制了约七十万美军，削弱了美帝对世界各地的控制，打乱了它反革命全球战略的部署，为世界反帝事业作出巨大贡献
    新华社二十六日讯 本社记者述评：正在从事抗美救国革命战争的英雄的越南南方军民，创造性地运用了毛主席的人民战争理论和战略战术，把号称世界上最强大的美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪，为全世界被压迫人民树立了依靠人民战争打败侵略者的新的光辉榜样。
    用人民战争打败美帝
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出，只有人民战争，才能战胜民族敌人。林彪同志说：“被侵略的人民用人民战争可以打败美帝国主义，当前最有说服力的例子是在越南。”越南南方军民的抗美救国革命战争就是这样一场真正的人民战争。
    从一九六五年美帝国主义大量增兵南越、赤膊上阵打一场局部战争以来，它虽然把除原子弹以外的现代化武器统统都用上了，也把最“精锐”的“王牌”部队用上了，但同南越军民较量的结果，美国强盗连遭惨败。两年多来，它共损兵折将近二十万人，单在去冬今春它发动的所谓第二个“旱季战略反攻”中，就被南越军民消灭七万人。
    美帝国主义目前已经直接向南越战场投入了超过侵朝战争美军总数的四十六万多部队，使用了战术空军的二分之一，同时还间接地投入了美国第七舰队的七万多名军队，以及驻关岛、冲绳、泰国等地的约十万美军。但是，在面积只有十七万平方公里的越南南方，人民武装实际上已牵制了约七十万美军，迫使美帝国主义削弱了对世界各地的控制，打乱了它的反革命全球战略的军事部署。
    只有一千四百万人口的越南南方，由于坚持人民战争，正在打败有两亿人口的头号帝国主义，这是战争史上的奇观，这是越南民族的壮举，这是全世界革命人民都热烈欢呼的惊天动地的伟业。
    建立一支真正的人民军队
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”越南南方人民正是由于建立了一支真正的人民的武装，才在艰苦卓绝的战斗中不断打败强敌，夺取一个又一个的胜利。
    从一九五四年日内瓦协议签订到一九五九年期间，越南南方人民由于没有自己的军队，曾经遭到美帝国主义及其走狗的血腥镇压和屠杀。在短短几年中，就有几十万前抗战人员和爱国居民被杀害和被打成残废，另外还有几十万人被关进监狱。为了自由、独立和国家的统一，越南南方人民忍无可忍，从一九五九年开始揭竿而起，纷纷组织自卫队、游击队，用棍棒、竹矛、弓箭和土枪等，抗击敌人。一九六一年二月，越南南方民族解放阵线随着形势的发展，把各地的人民武装统一组成解放武装力量。从此，解放武装力量在越南人民革命党和民族解放阵线的领导下，高举人民战争的伟大旗帜，更加有力地向美伪集团展开了勇猛战斗。
    解放武装力量来自人民，忠于人民，同人民群众建立了血肉的联系，他们充分动员群众并依靠群众进行战争。他们为正义事业而战，虽然在人数上没有敌军多，武器上没有敌人优良，但打起仗来英勇顽强，使敌人丧魂落魄。几年来，他们不仅打败了由美国出钱、出武器、由南越傀儡出人的“特种战争”，从一九六一年到一九六四年年底，消灭敌军约五十万人；而且正在打败由美国侵略军亲自上阵打的局部战争。由于解放武装力量在战斗中不断成长壮大，现在他们已经发展成为一支包括主力部队、地方部队和游击队的强大的人民军队。在一九六四年，解放武装力量就能够在一次战役或战斗中全歼伪军一个主力营。从一九六五年以来，解放武装力量不仅能够整营整团地消灭伪军，而且也能够整营整营地消灭美国侵略军。仅在今年头三个月中，解放武装力量就全歼敌军三十二个营，其中有二十二个营是美军。他们把美国强盗所吹嘘的美国“精锐”、“王牌”部队打得落花流水，闻风丧胆。
    实行人民战争的战略战术
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在论述人民战争的战略战术的时候，用四句话加以高度的概括，叫做：你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。
    越南南方军民正是创造性地运用了这种人民战争的战略战术，以己之长，攻敌之短，使敌人陷于被动挨打的困境。
    他们广泛开展游击战争，处处点起反侵略战争的火焰，同时不放松在有利条件下进行运动战，在运动中消灭敌人。他们创造了地雷战、地道战、水上游击战、奇袭战等巧妙的打法。美伪军一进犯解放区，就立即陷入了人民战争的天罗地网；解放区内不分男女老少都投入战斗，人自为战，村自为战，使敌人穷于应付。敌人的“直升飞机战术”、“装甲车战术”统统失灵，发挥不了自己的优势。敌人打不到和摸不着解放武装力量，而自己却不断挨打。近几年来，解放武装力量还经常派出精干的部队，深入敌人的心脏地区和重要基地大打奇袭战，打得敌人惶惶不可终日。仅在最近两年，解放武装力量就对美国在南越的四十五个空军基地发动了近一百二十次袭击，共击毁击伤敌人基地内的飞机近三千架。美伪集团控制的交通线，也不断被游击队破坏和切断，交通经常陷于瘫痪。在解放武装力量机动灵活的战略战术面前，与人民为敌的美伪军总是被打得晕头转向，束手无策。
    把农村建成巩固的根据地
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“……必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”越南南方军民，为了打败强大的敌人，夺取最后的胜利，正是这样做的。
    越南南方军民不仅在山区和丛林地带建立革命根据地，而且向人口稠密、河网交错、有敌人重兵防守的平原地区和交通线附近挺进，在这些地方建立许多游击区。经过几年的战斗，南越解放区由小到大，逐渐连成一片。在美伪集团的心脏西贡—嘉定地区，南越军民建立的解放区离西贡只有八公里；在由美军数万兵力防守的岘港，解放区已经伸展到它的鼻子底下。现在，从南越北部十七度线附近，经过广阔的西原地区和中部沿海地区，到富饶的南部平原，占整个南越的五分之四的土地和四分之三的人口，已经获得解放，形成了农村包围城市的有利局面。
    在广大解放区内，人民已经当家作主，建立了人民自己的政权机构。翻身后的劳动农民正沿着民族解放阵线指出的集体生产道路，纷纷成立了变工组和互助组，一面战斗、保卫解放区，一面积极增产粮食，支援前线。解放区的文教事业也欣欣向荣。由于解放区日益扩大和巩固，由于千百万群众已经动员和组织起来，现在解放区已经成了进行抗击美国强盗及其走狗的人民战争的可靠依托，它为进行长期战斗提供着雄厚的人力、物力，为夺取最后胜利打下了牢固基础。在去冬今春反击美国强盗发动的第二个“旱季攻势”的战斗中，各解放区有数以十万计的男女青年投入了支援前线的活动，大批青年踊跃参军和参加了游击队。在解放区不断扩大和巩固、农村包围城市的有利局面下，美伪集团惊慌万状，坐卧不安，面临最后覆灭的命运。
    铁的事实证明，越南南方人民的力量是无穷无尽的，他们可以在自己祖国的土地上世世代代地打下去，而庞大的美帝国主义却没有力量在南越战场上拖下去。英雄的越南南方军民已经用自己的胜利战斗实践，为世界上被压迫民族和被压迫人民提供了依靠人民战争可以打败美帝国主义及其走狗的丰富经验。英雄的越南南方军民必将更高地举起人民战争的旗帜，揪住美国强盗不放，同它持久而战，把美国侵略者拖垮、拖死，取得抗美救国战争的最后的彻底的胜利。
