The revolution's great criticism is a mass criticism.

To carry out the revolution's great criticism, whether to mobilize the broadest masses or to rely on a few people, is not a small matter but a major issue of which line to follow. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit; it is to let the masses rise up in revolution, to fully mobilize the masses to struggle against the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to fully mobilize the masses to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the current revolution's great criticism, we must continue to adhere to this revolutionary line. A large amount of evidence shows that in any unit where the masses are fully mobilized, the great criticism is both vigorous and thorough, the poison of revisionism can be thoroughly purged, the class consciousness of the masses can be greatly enhanced, and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought can be quickly established. Conversely, the movement will be cold and lifeless, and may even be unable to proceed, and the revolution's great criticism will be in danger of becoming a mere formality!

Some comrades think that exposing problems indeed requires relying on the masses, but to criticize and expose the poison of revisionism politically, ideologically, and theoretically, the masses' level is not enough, and it is better to rely on "one's own tongue," "one's own pen." This view is completely wrong. The revolution's great criticism is not some mysterious thing. The masses are practitioners of class struggle. In carrying out the revolution's great criticism, they have the most say. Especially when the masses have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works and have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp weapon, they can be invincible and unstoppable, and can overcome all obstacles.

For more than a decade, due to the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on all fronts, they have been spreading poison among the masses; the old ideas of the exploiting class have been continuously corrupting the masses. Therefore, only by fully, broadly, and deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out the revolution's great criticism, can the broadest masses be tempered in anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, "not only will the enemy's poisonous flames be expelled, but also one's own filth will be cleansed." Thus, from the depth of worldview, the roots of revisionism will be uprooted, and the bourgeois and all exploiting class ideas will be thoroughly criticized, and proletarian thought, Mao Zedong Thought, will be firmly established. Only by fully, broadly, and deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out the revolution's great criticism, can the broadest masses understand what is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and what is the bourgeois reactionary line; what is Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and what is revisionism; what is revolution and what is reform, and other fundamental major issues. In this way, in the future, at any time, in any place, as soon as the sprouts of revisionism appear, they will be exposed, seized, and overthrown by the surrounding masses, and will drown in the vast ocean of people's war, quickly crushing the conspiracy of capitalist restoration!

Care for National Affairs, Don't Be a "Carefree Person"

In such a profound cultural revolution and such intense class struggle, can you adopt an attitude of "carefree from the world" and "not getting involved"? No, you can't. Revolution touches your soul every day, and everything forces you to take a stand. Escaping is impossible, and not getting involved is self-deception. When Lu Xun satirized a person who "lacks the courage to face reality but wants to hang a revolutionary sign" he said: "Being in the present world, how can one leave? This is like deceiving people by saying one can leave the earth by holding one's ears." This is a portrayal of those who claim to "not get involved."

In the cultural revolution, adopting a "carefree" attitude is essentially political liberalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The source of liberalism lies in the selfishness of the petty bourgeoisie, who place personal interests first and revolutionary interests second." "Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and is fundamentally at odds with Marxism. It is a negative thing, and objectively it plays a role in aiding the enemy. Therefore, the enemy welcomes the preservation of liberalism within us."

Everyone writes their own history every moment. We must always maintain the bright red color of our history. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls. We hope that comrades who are still "carefree" should critically examine themselves, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply touch their own souls, and quickly join the fiery class struggle. The handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are still resisting and counterattacking. Can a revolutionary not be extremely indignant and content to be "carefree"? There is no insurmountable gulf from being a "carefree person" to being a thorough revolutionary. As long as one follows Chairman Mao's words, always advances with Chairman Mao in great storms, always revolutionizes, and transforms oneself, one will definitely be tempered into a true proletarian revolutionary fighter in the long-term class struggle and in the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Push the Revolution's Great Criticism to a Deeper Level

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is an antidote. It not only expels the enemy's poisonous flames but also cleanses one's own filth." The power of a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in political and ideological terms is mainly reflected in their influence among the masses. This "power" cannot be stripped away through organizational means such as dismissal or removal from office; it must be thoroughly and cleanly stripped away through a broad and deep mass movement of exposure, criticism, and struggle from the bottom up. Through the revolution's great criticism, the broad revolutionary masses, while purging all the poison spread by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, touch their own souls, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is the fundamental guarantee for pushing the revolution's great criticism to a deeper level and achieving a thorough victory in the struggle for political and ideological power.

Whether the revolution's great criticism can be pushed to a deeper level does not depend on how many large meetings are held or the size of the meetings, but on whether Mao Zedong Thought is actively learned and applied in the revolution's great criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and guiding the revolution's great criticism movement with Mao Zedong Thought.

To fully mobilize the masses and gradually deepen the revolution's great criticism movement, it is necessary to closely combine the revolution's great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's own unit or department. Only in this way can the broad revolutionary masses further arouse their class hatred towards the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly expose and deeply criticize their heinous crimes, cut off the black hands of the Chinese Khrushchev reaching out to various places, and thoroughly purge the poison he spread on all fronts. At the same time, only in this way can the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation be effectively improved.

The revolution's great criticism is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and is the decisive battle of the two classes, two roads, and two lines at present. Leading comrades at all levels should follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, take the lead in the revolution's great criticism, grasp the key to the revolution's great criticism, go among the masses, and be with the masses, "mobilize the masses," "rely on the masses," and "properly organize the masses' enthusiasm." Rally the vast revolutionary criticism army to push the revolution's great criticism to a new high, lead it to an even deeper level, and bring all other work to a comprehensive level, achieving a thorough victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution!

    将革命的大批判进行到底
    ——各地报纸评论摘要
    革命大批判是群众性的大批判
    开展革命的大批判，究竟是发动最广大的群众，还是依靠少数人，这不是一个小问题，而是执行什么路线的大问题。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神；就是让群众自己起来革命，放手发动群众斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，放手发动群众进行斗、批、改。在当前的革命大批判中，我们必须继续坚持执行这条革命路线。大量事实证明，哪个单位的群众充分发动起来了，哪个单位的大批判就既轰轰烈烈又深入细致，修正主义的流毒就容易彻底肃清，群众的阶级觉悟也能大大提高，毛泽东思想的绝对权威就能迅速地树立起来。反之，运动就会冷冷清清，甚至搞不下去，革命的大批判就有走过场的危险！
    有的同志以为，揭发问题确实需要依靠群众，但是从政治上、思想上、理论上把这些修正主义流毒批深批透，群众的水平是不够的，不如依靠“自己的舌头”，“自己的笔头”。这个观点是十分错误的。革命的大批判并不是什么神秘的事情，群众是阶级斗争的实践者。进行革命的大批判，他们最有发言权。特别是，当群众活学活用了毛主席著作，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器以后，就能所向披靡，战无不胜，攻无不克。
    十多年来，由于党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在各条战线上推行反革命修正主义路线，一直在群众中散布流毒；剥削阶级的旧思想又不断在腐蚀群众。因此，只有充分广泛而深入地发动群众，进行革命大批判，才能使最广大的群众得到反修防修的锻炼，“不但将排除敌人的毒焰，也将清洗自己的污浊。”从而从思想上挖掉修正主义的根子，从世界观的深度上，大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想、毛泽东思想。只有充分广泛而深入地发动群众，进行革命的大批判，才能使最广大的群众弄清什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线；什么是马列主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义；什么是革命，什么是改良等等根本性的重大问题。这样，今后在任何时候，任何场所，只要修正主义苗子一露头，就会被周围的群众识破、揪出、批倒，就会淹死在人民战争的汪洋大海之中，使资本主义复辟的阴谋迅速遭到粉碎！

    关心国家大事  不当“逍遥派”
    在无产阶级文化大革命这样深入，阶级斗争这样激烈的时候，你能够采取“逍遥世外”“不介入”的态度吗？不行的。革命，天天都在触你的灵魂，事事都逼着你表态。想逃避是逃避不了的，不介入只能是自欺欺人。鲁迅讽刺一种“没有正视现实的勇气，又要挂革命的招牌”的人时说：“身在现世，怎么离去？这是和说自己用手提着耳朵，就可以离开地球者一样地欺人。”这就是对所谓“不介入”者的写照。
    在文化大革命中抱“逍遥”的态度，实质上是政治上的自由主义。毛主席教导我们：“自由主义的来源，在于小资产阶级的自私自利性，以个人利益放在第一位，革命利益放在第二位”。“自由主义是机会主义的一种表现，是和马克思主义根本冲突的。它是消极的东西，客观上起着援助敌人的作用，因此敌人是欢迎我们内部保存自由主义的。”
    每个人每时每刻都在写自己的历史。我们要永远保持自己历史鲜红的颜色。毛泽东思想是改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义。我们希望现在还在“逍遥”的同志，应当对自己痛下针砭，活学活用毛主席著作，狠触自己的灵魂，赶快投入火热的阶级斗争中去。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派仍在顽抗，仍在反扑。一个革命者能够不万分愤慨，安心“逍遥”吗！？从一个“逍遥派”到一个彻底革命派，没有什么不可逾越的鸿沟。只要听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进，永远革命，改造自己，就一定能够在长期阶级斗争的风浪中，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，把自己锻炼成为一个真正的无产阶级革命战士！

    把革命的大批判引向深入
    毛主席教导我们说：“革命战争是一种抗毒素，它不但将排除敌人的毒焰，也将清洗自己的污浊。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在政治思想上的权，主要表现在他们在群众中的影响。而这种“权”，采取撤职、罢官等组织手段是剥夺不了的，必须通过自下而上开展广泛的深入的群众性的大揭露、大批判、大斗争，才能彻底、干净地剥夺掉。通过革命的大批判，广大革命群众在肃清一小撮反革命修正主义分子散布的一切流毒的同时，触及自己的灵魂，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，促进人们的思想革命化。这是把革命的大批判引向深入，取得政治思想上夺权斗争彻底胜利的根本保证。
    能不能把革命的大批判引向深入，其关键不在于大会开得多少，也不在于会议规模的大小，而在于是否在革命的大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判运动。
    要达到充分发动群众，使革命的大批判运动逐步深入，就必须把革命的大批判同本单位、本部门的斗批改紧密结合起来。只有这样，才能进一步激发广大革命群众对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阶级仇恨，对他们犯下的滔天罪行进行充分的揭露和深刻的批判，才能斩断中国的赫鲁晓夫伸向各地的黑手，并彻底肃清其在各条战线上散布的流毒。同时，也只有这样，才能有效地提高斗批改的水平。
    革命的大批判，是毛主席伟大的战略部署，是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的总决战。各级负责同志要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，挂革命大批判之帅，抓革命大批判之纲，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，“动员群众”，“依靠群众”，“恰当地组织群众的积极性”，调动浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，把革命的大批判推向新的高潮，引向更加深入，把其他各项工作全面地带动起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
