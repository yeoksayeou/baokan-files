The principle of supporting the army and loving the people is the correct approach to handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses. Revolutionary factions across the country are launching a larger-scale movement to support the army. Many places are holding meetings to support the army and love the people, drafting agreements to support the army, and closely uniting soldiers and civilians to strive for new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, "We must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, raise high the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, always trust the People's Liberation Army, support the People's Liberation Army, rely on the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army. We must swiftly launch a large-scale, enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people across the country!" This is the unanimous voice of the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in various places across the country, enthusiastically responding to the editorial in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on launching a large-scale, enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people. They pointed out: Our great leader Chairman Mao personally created, personally led, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao directly commanded the great People's Liberation Army of China, which is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great pillar for defending the national security of our socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Supporting the army and loving the people is the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, the strategic slogan and powerful driving force for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must seriously study, deeply understand, enthusiastically propagate, and resolutely implement it.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, and other places have responded most enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." They have decided to closely unite with the People's Liberation Army and fight shoulder to shoulder, launching a new high tide in the great movement to support the army and love the people. They will raise high the revolutionary banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought and, in the decisive battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, advance courageously and strive for new and even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In Beijing and Shanghai, a new high tide of the movement to support the army and love the people is rising, with an ever-larger and deeper scale. Many workers in factories, together with the People's Liberation Army, are drafting agreements to support the army, determined to, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, more firmly trust, support, rely on, and learn from the army. Soldiers and civilians will unite and fight shoulder to shoulder, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Comrades from the three revolutionary organizations in Shandong Province—Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and Shandong Red Guards Art Revolution Rebel Command—recalling the year-long struggle with the People's Liberation Army, all said emotionally, "Without such a people's army, we could not have smoothly carried out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In Guiyang and Xining, grand meetings with the participation of soldiers and civilians were held yesterday and today, enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call and launching a large-scale, enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people.

The fighters from revolutionary mass organizations such as "Gangong General," "Gangong Second Command," "Gangong 913," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commands United" in Wuhan, recalling their experiences of fighting side by side with the Wuhan garrison troops during the Cultural Revolution, have a deeper understanding: "Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." They said, facts have proven: military-civilian unity is our revolutionary treasure and the fundamental guarantee for our complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must strengthen military-civilian unity and launch a new high tide in the movement to support the army.

The fighters from revolutionary cadres such as "Changsha Workers' Federation" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" in Hunan Province, after studying the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, unanimously agreed that over the past year, the People's Liberation Army has made outstanding contributions and great achievements in the "three supports and two militaries" work. We must support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions, always unite with them, fight with them, and win with them. Today, two hundred thousand revolutionary cadres, revolutionary workers, and garrison troops from provincial and municipal organs held a grand meeting, enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call to launch a movement to support the army and love the people, deciding to strengthen military-civilian unity, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a revolutionary great criticism, and thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, overthrow and expose them, and thoroughly eliminate their poison.

The revolutionary fighters of the "Erqi Commune" in Henan, while enthusiastically welcoming the publication of the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, have been drafting agreements to support the army, determined to assist and support the People's Liberation Army in doing the "three supports and two militaries" work with practical actions. The agreement of "Zhengda United Committee" under the "Erqi Commune" emphasizes: "All fighters of Zhengda United Committee must assist the army in doing the 'three supports and two militaries' work. If we do not handle the relationship with the army well, we must actively make self-criticisms, publicly and seriously examine our shortcomings and mistakes." The agreement states that we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, prevent class enemies from sowing discord between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the army, and firmly believe in the army, taking the army as our learning example.

The basic organizations under the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of Proletarian Revolutionaries in Jiangxi Province, after studying the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, enthusiastically reported to the Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the province. The revolutionary young fighters of the Jianxi Agricultural College Jianxi Red Guards Command and the Nanchang No. 10 Middle School Jianxi Brigade said, "We Red Guards revolutionary young fighters love the army the most, support the army the most, trust the army the most, and rely on the army the most. We resolutely learn from the army. We firmly will not say anything that harms military-civilian unity and will not do anything that harms military-civilian unity."

In Urumqi, the "Red Second Command" of Xinjiang and revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups held a meeting today. The representative of the "Red Second Command" of Xinjiang said at the meeting, "The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are terrified and enraged by the firm as a rock unity between us revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the army. They try to confuse right and wrong and sow discord between the military and civilians. We must see through their tricks and cherish the People's Liberation Army as we cherish our own eyes."

The many organizations under the "Red Third Command" of Gansu and the soldiers and fighters of the Lanzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army held discussions over the past two days, summarizing the achievements and experiences of supporting the army and loving the people in the previous stage, and drafting new agreements to support the army. The fighters of the "Red Third Command" said: "We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve new merits in the movement to support the army."

The fighters of the Third Command of the Red Guards in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, said, "We resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and are prepared to launch a large-scale movement to support the army and love the people. In the future, we must more humbly learn from the advanced experience of the army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learn from the army's outstanding tradition of emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the Three-Eight Style." The Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Inner Mongolia held a special meeting on the 29th, calling on the military and civilians across the region to launch a new high tide in supporting the army and loving the people.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Ningxia, including the "Red Education and Culture Army" and the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought at Ningxia University, have been extensively carrying out activities to support the army in various forms over the past few days, further strengthening the fighting friendship between the military and civilians.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Changchun, including the "Red Revolutionary Association," "Second Headquarters," "Changchun Commune," and "East is Red Commune," expressed that our great leader Chairman Mao personally created, personally led, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao directly commanded the army is an unparalleled great army. We must strive to learn from the army. The basic organizations under the "Changchun Commune," "East is Red Commune," "Red Revolutionary Association," and "Second Headquarters" also held military-civilian welcome meetings.

On the evening when the People's Daily published the editorial "Launch a Large-Scale, Enthusiastic Movement to Support the Army and Love the People," the Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters of Zhejiang Province immediately convened the responsible comrades and representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations under its jurisdiction to jointly study the editorial and drafted a new agreement to support the army. They decided to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign to make the great significance of supporting the army deeply rooted in people's hearts and launch a large-scale movement to learn from the army.

The responsible comrades of the Battle Headquarters to Defend Mao Zedong Thought in Anshan said: "When we were brutally suppressed by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within Anshan, it was the broad soldiers and fighters of the Anshan garrison units 3174, 7111, and 3792 who brought us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, supported us, and repelled the enemy's attacks. When we step by step moved towards victory, it was the army that helped us study the 'Three Articles,' break private selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and unite with brother organizations to launch a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan." They expressed that in future battles, they will always trust, support, rely on, and learn from the army.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat such as "101" in the old revolutionary base of Shaanbei, Miji County, after studying the editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, deeply felt that the revolutionary comrades of the Miji County People's Armed Department firmly supported us, making us grow from weak to strong and from small to large, achieving great victories in the Cultural Revolution. In the future, we must more humbly learn from the People's Liberation Army, unite more closely with the People's Liberation Army, fight with them, and be models in supporting the army.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in Chengdu, Fuzhou, Nanning, Baoding, Tianjin, and other places have also launched various activities over the past two days, unanimously expressing their determination to strictly implement Chairman Mao's great instructions and launch a large-scale, enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people.
