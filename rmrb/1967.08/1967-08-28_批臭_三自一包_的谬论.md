Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has led us poor and lower-middle peasants from forming mutual aid teams to cooperatives, and then to people's communes, advancing boldly on the socialist road. However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has jumped out, shouting loudly about "four freedoms" and "three freedoms and one contract," paving the way for the restoration of capitalism and openly opposing our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

The "four freedoms" and "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by China's Khrushchev have caused extensive harm. Our brigade has also been greatly poisoned. In 1962, some cadres in our brigade, after hearing the black words of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, called for production teams to contract work and production to groups, implementing small-scale contracting for team members and using work points as incentives, opposing the emphasis on politics. The result was that the more they contracted, the more backward people's thinking became, the poorer the quality of farm work, and the lower the production. Some well-off farmers went to free markets and focused on their private plots, showing no love for the collective and not following the distribution plan. The brigade cadres also set up a "self-responsible profit and loss" livestock farm, which had a blacksmith's forge, tofu workshop, a horse-drawn cart, as well as cows and chickens. This farm was completely for the service of some degenerated and corrupted cadres. They could borrow money at will within the farm, eat and drink lavishly, and did not care about the living conditions of the team members. This is the evil result of the "four freedoms" and "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is purely a fake revolutionary, an anti-revolutionary! We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly fight and overthrow the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, refute the fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract," and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

    批臭“三自一包”的谬论
    黑龙江省双城县双城镇人民公社东方红大队社员  段兴国
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，领导我们贫下中农，从办互助组到办合作社，以后又办起了人民公社，在社会主义大道上阔步前进。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却跳出来大喊大叫什么“四大自由”“三自一包”等等谬论，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，公开和我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席唱反调。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“四大自由”“三自一包”，流毒甚广，我们大队也受到很大毒害。一九六二年，我们大队某些干部，听了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的黑话，号召各生产队包工包产到组，对社员实行小包工，实行工分刺激，反对突出政治。结果是越包人的思想越落后，越包农活质量越差，越包产量越低。有的富裕农民跑自由市场，在自留地上下功夫，不热爱集体，不听从分配。大队干部还搞了一个“自负盈亏”的畜牧场，场内设有铁匠炉、豆腐坊，一台马车拉脚，还有奶牛和鸡鸭等。这个场完全是为一些蜕化变质的干部服务的。他们可以在场内任意借款，大吃大喝，不问社员的生活怎样。这就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“四大自由”“三自一包”的恶果。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派纯粹是假革命，反革命！我们贫下中农决心奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底斗倒、斗垮党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，批臭“三自一包”的谬论，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
