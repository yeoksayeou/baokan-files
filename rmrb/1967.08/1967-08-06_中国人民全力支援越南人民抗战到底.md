The Chinese people will fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance to the end.

BEIJING, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Xiannian today, at a banquet he hosted to see off the Vietnamese government economic delegation led by Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi, warmly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He pointed out that the Vietnamese people's struggle has once again proven that people's war is the most effective weapon to annihilate U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and is the broad road to complete liberation for all oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: only people's war can defeat the enemy of the nation. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has set another brilliant example of relying on people's war to defeat the aggressors and achieve great victories. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will bury U.S. imperialism in the vast sea of people's war and achieve complete victory.

He said: the current situation in Vietnam is getting better and better. U.S. imperialism is in its death throes, desperately playing its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. On the one hand, it attempts to reverse its defeat by increasing troops and expanding the war; on the other hand, it continues to spread the smoke screen of peace talks. At a time when U.S. imperialism is in great difficulty, Soviet modern revisionism is hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism, attempting to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression. This is a great betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership against the Vietnamese people. No matter what tricks and conspiracies U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism play, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, this time, the two sides of China and Vietnam had friendly and cordial talks, achieving a satisfactory result, and signed an economic and technical aid agreement. This talk embodies the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam and the firm will to defeat U.S. imperialism. Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is our internationalist duty. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will fully support the Vietnamese people to carry on the war of resistance against U.S. aggression to the end, until they achieve final victory.

When talking about the current massive and unprecedented movement of revolutionary masses in our country to criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, this is a great strategic deployment by our great leader Chairman Mao, and this is the major direction of our current struggle. This great criticism is a decisive battle concerning the future and destiny of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi then spoke at the banquet filled with the fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. He said, the negotiations between Vietnam and China on economic aid have achieved a satisfactory result due to the consistent and resolute support and full aid from the Communist Party of China, the government of China, the fraternal Chinese people, and the beloved Chairman Mao to the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people, especially to our people's current war of resistance against U.S. aggression. The agreement signed today on economic and technical aid from China to Vietnam once again eloquently proves the close comradeship and fighting unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China, sharing weal and woe, life and death. It also proves the lofty proletarian internationalist spirit and resolute anti-imperialist spirit of the seven hundred million Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong.

Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi said, this aid from China is of great significance. It will help to further strengthen our people's economic and national defense potential, to defeat all new tricks and military adventures of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to achieve even greater victories. This aid from China is a new and powerful encouragement to the entire military and civilian population of Vietnam who are striving to realize the historic call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh. This aid from China will surely help to further strengthen the fighting unity and brotherly friendship between our two parties and peoples.

Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi said, during our friendly visit to China, we have seen everywhere the sincere and beautiful expressions of the fighting unity and close friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. Everyone we met sincerely praised the great victories achieved by the military and civilian population in the south and north of our country in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression, and unanimously expressed a common will: "Actively support the Vietnamese people to fight to the final victory, and be prepared to take action at any time and place when the peoples of Vietnam and China deem it necessary, to jointly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi finally wished that the unbreakable fighting unity and brotherly friendship between the two parties and peoples of Vietnam and China would last forever, and wished that the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao, would achieve even greater and more brilliant victories in socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Those present at the banquet tonight included Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant responsible officials Fang Yi, Peng Shaohui, Luo Guibo, Li Qiang, Ding Xilin, Zhang Xianyao, Yang Lin, Nie Yuanzi, and others.

The deputy head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Ly Son Son, and the counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, Nguyen Quang Huy, were also invited to the banquet.

    中国人民全力支援越南人民抗战到底
    李先念副总理设宴欢送越南政府经济代表团
    黎清毅副总理说中国的援助有助于越南人民打败美帝侵略
    新华社五日讯　李先念副总理今天在他为欢送黎清毅副总理率领的越南政府经济代表团举行的宴会上，热烈赞扬越南人民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。他指出，越南人民的斗争实践再次证明，人民战争是置美帝国主义及其走狗于死地的最有效的法宝，是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民取得彻底解放的康庄大道。
    李先念副总理说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：只有人民战争，才能战胜民族敌人。越南人民的抗美救国战争，树立了依靠人民战争打击侵略者，取得伟大胜利的又一个光辉榜样。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民必将把美帝国主义埋葬在伟大的人民战争的汪洋大海之中，取得彻底的胜利。
    他说：当前，越南形势越来越好，美帝国主义正在进行垂死挣扎，加紧玩弄反革命的两手策略，一面妄图用增兵和扩大战争来挽救它的败局；另一面又继续放出和谈烟幕。在美帝国主义处境十分困难的时候，苏联现代修正主义加紧同美帝勾结，力图破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。这是苏修领导集团对越南人民的大叛卖。不论美帝苏修玩弄什么阴谋诡计，它们都必将遭到可耻的失败。
    李先念副总理说，这次中越双方进行了亲切友好的会谈，取得圆满的结果，签订了经济技术援助协定。这次会谈体现了中越两国人民坚如磐石的战斗友谊和决心战胜美帝国主义的坚强意志。李先念副总理说，支援越南人民的抗美战争，是我们应尽的国际主义义务。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，全力支援越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    在谈到当前我国亿万革命群众掀起的规模空前的对党内一小撮最大的走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判运动时，李先念副总理说，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是我们当前斗争的大方向。这场革命的大批判是关系到中国革命和世界革命的前途和命运的大决战。
    黎清毅接着在充满中越两国人民战斗友谊的宴会上讲话。他说，越中两国关于经济援助的谈判，所以能取得圆满的结果，是由于中国共产党、中国政府、兄弟的中国人民和敬爱的毛主席对越南人民的革命事业，特别是对我国人民当前的抗美救国斗争的始终不渝的坚决的支持和全力的援助。今天签订的关于中国给予越南经济和技术援助的协定，又一次雄辩地证明了越中两国人民之间的同甘共苦、生死与共的亲密的同志情谊和战斗团结，它还证明了在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下的七亿中国人民崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神和坚决反对帝国主义的革命精神。
    黎清毅副总理说，中国的这一次援助，具有十分重大的意义，它有助于进一步加强我国人民的经济和国防潜力，以打败美帝国主义及其走狗的一切新阴谋和一切新的军事冒险，进而取得更巨大的胜利。中国的这一次援助对正在努力实现胡志明主席富有历史性的号召的越南全国军民是一个新的、强有力的鼓舞。中国的这一次援助必将有助于进一步加强我们两党、两国人民间的战斗团结和兄弟友谊。
    黎清毅副总理说，我们在中国进行友好访问期间，到处看到越中两国人民战斗的团结和亲密友谊的诚挚美好的表现。所有的人在遇到我们代表团时，都真诚地赞扬我国南方和北方的军民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的巨大胜利，并一致表示了一个共同的意愿：“积极支援越南人民战斗到最后胜利，并作好了一切准备，在中越两国人民认为必要的时候，随时随地都将采取行动，以共同打败美国侵略者。”
    黎清毅副总理最后祝越中两党和两国人民之间牢不可破的战斗团结和兄弟友谊万古长青，祝兄弟的中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中取得更大的更辉煌的胜利。
    出席今晚宴会的有陈毅副总理和有关方面负责人方毅、彭绍辉、罗贵波、李强、丁西林、张贤约、杨琳、聂元梓等。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长黎松山和越南驻中国大使馆参赞阮光辉也应邀出席了宴会。
