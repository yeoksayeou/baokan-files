The color documentary "Beijing Supports You" vividly records the greatest support and care from our great leader Chairman Mao, our Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Wuhan area! The People's Liberation Army, created and led by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Vice Helmsman Lin, and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stands firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We vow to stand heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary faction, to unite and fight together, and to achieve victory together, unbreakable by thunder or severed by swords. We, the revolutionary faction in the capital, will definitely stand firmly by your side, share your concerns, think your thoughts, and hate your enemies. We will wholeheartedly, passionately, and unhesitatingly support you in every way! Neither storms nor heavy rains can stop our march. Our indignation against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is unquenchable. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is our sworn enemy, and we will fight to the end! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, we will not abandon Mao Zedong Thought. We will defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line even if we have to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire!

Those who have committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people, such as China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, have already been surrounded by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Their fate of complete collapse and annihilation is inevitable. However, the enemy will not surrender easily. China's Khrushchev and his agents, though beaten down by us and turned into fallen dogs, are not yet "dead tigers." We must not forget the many bloody lessons of history, nor the current situation. "It is better to exhaust one's strength in pursuing the fleeing enemy than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." We must carry forward the spirit of beating fallen dogs and strike them down politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that they can never rise again.

We, the guards of Chairman Mao, will always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, remain highly vigilant, and stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary faction. We will concentrate all our hatred on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, and advance together with the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan and across the country. Let China's Khrushchev and his gang be infamous forever; let our proletarian iron kingdom never change color; let the great, invincible, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought shine throughout China and illuminate the world.

    永远和革命派在一起
    中国人民解放军首都警卫战士　李卫东
    彩色纪录片《北京支持你们》生动地纪录了我们伟大领袖毛主席、我们的林彪副主席、党中央和中央文革小组对武汉地区无产阶级革命派的最大支持！最大关怀！伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副统帅直接指挥的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，誓同无产阶级革命派心贴心、肩并肩，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，雷打不散，刀砍不断。我们和首都的无产阶级革命派一定要紧紧地站在你们一边，急你们所急，想你们所想，恨你们所恨，全心全意地、满腔热情地、毫不含糊地从各方面支援你们！狂风阻拦不住我们行进的行列，大雨扑不灭我们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的万丈怒火。谁胆敢反对毛主席、反对林副主席、反对党中央、反对中央文革小组、反对无产阶级文化大革命，谁就是我们不共戴天的死敌，我们就要和他拚到底！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢，上刀山，下火海，也要捍卫毛主席的革命路线！
    对党和人民犯下滔天罪行的中国的赫鲁晓夫及一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，已经陷入了亿万革命群众的重重包围之中。他们彻底垮台、彻底灭亡的命运注定了。但是，敌人是不甘心失败的。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，他们虽然被我们打翻在地了，成了落水狗，但是，他们仅仅是落水的恶狗，还不是“死老虎”，我们千万不能忘记历史上的许多血的教训，千万不能忘记眼前的事，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要发扬痛打落水狗的精神，狠狠地打击他们，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们彻底批倒、批透、批臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
    我们毛主席身边的警卫战士，一定牢记毛主席的伟大教导，时刻保持高度警惕，誓死和无产阶级革命派站在一起，把千仇万恨都集中到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，永远同武汉地区和全国的无产阶级革命派一起，乘胜前进。让中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙遗臭万年；让我们无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色；让伟大的、战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想红遍全中国，照亮全世界。
