In the great strategic battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, which has been achieving victory after victory, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shanghai, who have made outstanding contributions in the "three supports, two military" work, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are carrying forward the spirit of thoroughly beating the "fallen dogs" and further concentrating their targets, firepower, and wisdom to launch a massive wave of revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, resolutely criticizing and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly eliminating their poisonous influences.

The PLA troops stationed in Shanghai, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have undergone tremendous tempering in the great struggle of the Cultural Revolution. They deeply understand that to carry out revolutionary criticism, to criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, is the most important political task and a matter of national significance. They closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and, in barracks, airfields, ships, and offices, and on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" work, everyone speaks out and takes action. They fully utilize denunciation meetings, struggle-criticism meetings, big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and cultural propaganda, and other weapons to relentlessly attack and fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

After Vice Chairman Lin issued the battle cry to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution," the broad masses of cadres and soldiers are even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. On August 24, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai held a grand meeting. Leaders Li Shiyang, Liu Wenxue, Rao Shoukun, Duan Dezhang, Mei Jiasheng, Yu Guangmao, Zhang Jihou, Zhang Yiaiai, and Ji Yingwu of the three services stationed in Shanghai attended the meeting. The leaders and cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai together angrily exposed and criticized the great conspiracy and ambition of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who usurped the military and opposed the party.

Everyone said in their speeches, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'All warlords love their soldiers as their lives. They all cherish the principle of 'having an army means having power.' China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, have never stopped their evil activities of seizing military power for the bourgeoisie. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, this bunch of bad guys, in order to seize military power for the bourgeoisie, have always created divisions within the military and the party, recruited traitors, formed cliques, and played two-faced games. They blocked information from the center and deceived the masses, attempting to turn our great People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded by the great leader Chairman Mao, into a tool for counter-revolutionary restoration. They have deliberately, systematically, and organizedly launched one wave after another of ferocious attacks against the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, attempting to realize their dream of usurping the party and the military and restoring capitalism. The cadres and soldiers pointed out: If their conspiracy succeeds, our country, party, and heads will be doomed, and the Chinese revolution and world revolution will suffer a great setback. They said: We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle.' Our proletarian state, whoever dares to touch it, we will overthrow them! The cadres and soldiers also expressed that China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, being exposed again proves: The People's Liberation Army of China, personally founded and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Any conspirator, any counter-revolutionary revisionist, no matter what banner they raise, what conspiracy they plot, what methods they use, or what backing they rely on, if they dare to harm the People's Liberation Army and engage in usurping the military and opposing the party, they will inevitably suffer a complete failure!"

The leaders and broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, angrily exposed and criticized Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's heinous crimes of crazily opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, and opposing Vice Chairman Lin's series of instructions on the four firsts. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and we absolutely do not allow the gun to command the party.' Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's emphasis on military first and technology first is itself a class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Their scheme is completely in the service of China's Khrushchev's reactionary political purpose of opposing proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism, attempting to remove the soul and lifeline of our party and army, change the political direction and proletarian nature of our party and army, and use bourgeois and revisionist faces to transform the army and society, realizing their counter-revolutionary conspiracy to restore capitalism. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers firmly expressed that they will always take Vice Chairman Lin as their example, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and dedicate all their heart and soul to defending Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and military line.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, with the fighting spirit further ignited in the revolutionary criticism, proudly declared: Currently, the front lines of the "three supports, two military" are our glorious battlefield for defending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We swear to unite with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fight together, and win together, resolutely smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

    驻上海陆海空三军进一步掀起群众性的革命大批判运动
    发扬痛打“落水狗”的精神  把彭德怀罗瑞卿批倒批臭
    据新华社上海二十六日电　在彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的伟大战略决战取得节节胜利的大好形势下，在“三支”、“两军”工作中作出了卓越贡献的人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，进一步集中目标、集中火力、集中智慧，向中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，发起波澜壮阔的群众性的革命大批判运动，坚决从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批臭，肃清他们的一切流毒。
    无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人民解放军驻沪部队指战员，经受了无产阶级文化大革命伟大斗争的巨大锻炼。他们深刻地认识到，开展革命的大批判，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透，批倒、批臭，是当前最大的政治，头等重要的国家大事，是无产阶级革命战士压倒一切的战斗任务。他们紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署，在营房、机场、舰艇、机关，在“三支”、“两军”的第一线，人人动口，人人动手，充分运用声讨会、批判斗争会、大字报、黑板报、文艺宣传等各种武器，向中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，穷追猛打，狠批狠斗。
    在林副主席发出“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召以后，广大指战员更加意气风发，斗志昂扬。二十四日，驻沪三军广大指战员举行了声势浩大的集会。驻沪三军负责人李世焱、刘文学、饶守坤、段德彰、梅嘉生、余光茂、张吉厚、张宜爱、姬应伍等出席了大会。驻沪三军负责人和干部、战士一起，愤怒揭发、批判大阴谋家、大野心家彭德怀、罗瑞卿篡军反党的滔天罪行。
    大家在发言中说，毛主席指出：“一切军阀，都爱兵如命，他们都看重了‘有军则有权’的原则。”中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流处心积虑地为资产阶级争兵权的罪恶活动，一刻也没有停止过。彭德怀、罗瑞卿这伙坏家伙，为了给资产阶级争兵权，抓枪杆子，一贯在军内、党内制造分裂，招降纳叛，结党营私，阴一套，阳一套，对上封锁中央，对下蒙蔽群众，妄图把我们伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的伟大的人民解放军变成实行反革命复辟的工具。他们有目的、有计划、有组织地向毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发动一次又一次的猖狂进攻，妄图实现篡党、篡军，复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。指战员们指出：如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们就要亡国、亡党、亡头，中国革命和世界革命就要大倒退。他们说：我们要永远牢记毛主席的教导：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们的无产阶级江山，谁敢动她的一根毫毛，我们就打倒谁！指战员们还表示，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流被揭露出来，再一次证明：伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大军队。任何野心家、阴谋家，任何反革命修正主义分子，不管他打着什么旗号，施展什么阴谋，运用什么手法，依仗什么后台，他们要对人民解放军下毒手，搞篡军反党的罪恶活动，必然碰得头破血流，以彻底失败而告终！
    驻沪三军负责人和广大干部战士，还以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，愤怒揭发、批判了彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流为了改变我们军队的无产阶级性质，疯狂反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对林副主席关于四个第一的一系列指示的滔天罪行。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党。”彭德怀、罗瑞卿大搞军事第一，技术第一，其本身就是资产阶级对抗无产阶级的阶级斗争。他们搞的这一套，完全是为中国的赫鲁晓夫反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的反动政治目的服务的，是妄图抽掉我党我军的灵魂和命根子，改变我党我军的政治方向和无产阶级性质，妄图用资产阶级、修正主义的面貌来改造军队，改造社会，实现他们复辟资本主义的反革命阴谋。广大指战员无比坚定地表示，永远以林副统帅为榜样，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和建军路线，贡献全部心血和毕生精力。
    驻沪三军广大指战员以在革命大批判中进一步激发起来的战斗激情，豪迈地表示：当前，“三支”、“两军”第一线，就是我们保卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光荣战场，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。我们誓与无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，坚决把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁，把文化大革命进行到底！
