	French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) organ "New People's Tribune" published an article to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, praising the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded by Chairman Mao, and pointing out that the theory of people's war formulated by Chairman Mao is not only applicable to China but also to the whole world.

	The article, titled "The 40 Years of Experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Prove: Political Power Grows Out of the Barrel of a Gun," emphasizes that the Chinese People's Liberation Army was personally founded by Chairman Mao Zedong and is guided by Mao Zedong Thought. This army, directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, has become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The article points out that the people's revolutionary war led by the Communist Party of China lasted for 22 years and is "the longest, most complex, and most experienced people's war led by the proletariat in the world today."

	The article points out that the practice of the Chinese revolution has proved that whenever the correct line of Mao Zedong Thought is deviated from, the people's forces suffer setbacks. From the right-opportunist Chen Duxiu to Wang Ming, and up to the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, their policies of capitulationism, defeatism, and sectarianism all deviated from the Marxist-Leninist line determined by the Party. On the contrary, Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, achieving the victory of socialism in China.

	The article quotes Chairman Mao's words: "A party which is disciplined, armed with Marxism-Leninism, practices self-criticism, and maintains close ties with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and all revolutionary groups led by such a party. These are the main weapons with which we have defeated the enemy."

	The article says: "These principles are not only applicable to China but also to the whole world, especially under the current conditions. The necessity of armed struggle is becoming increasingly clear. Modern revisionists try to make people forget this and slander and distort Comrade Mao Zedong's important thesis that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' The article points out that Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, once again emphasized and elaborated on this thesis in his article 'Long Live the Victory of People's War.'"

    法国《新人又道报》发表文章指出
    毛主席的人民战争理论适用于全世界
    据新华社巴黎三十一日电　法国共产主义运动
  （马克思列宁主义）机关刊物《新人道报》为纪念中国人民解放军建军四十周年，在七月二十七日发表文章，热烈赞扬毛主席亲手缔造的伟大的中国人民解放军，同时指出，毛主席制定的人民战争的理论不仅适用于中国，而且适用于全世界。
    这篇题为《中国人民解放军四十年的经验说明，枪杆子里面出政权》的文章强调指出，中国人民解放军是毛泽东主席亲手缔造的，是由毛泽东思想指导的。这支在林彪同志直接指挥下的军队，成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    文章指出，中国共产党领导的人民革命战争历时二十二年之久，是“当今世界上无产阶级领导的时间最长、斗争最复杂、经验最丰富的人民战争”。
    文章指出，中国革命的实践证明，每当脱离毛泽东思想的正确路线时，人民力量就遭受挫折。从右倾机会主义者陈独秀到王明，直至中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，他们所推行的投降主义、失败主义和宗派主义政策都背离了党所确定的马克思列宁主义的路线。相反，毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，使社会主义在中国取得了胜利。
    文章引用了毛主席的话：“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。”
    文章说：“这些原则不仅适用于中国，而且适用于全世界，特别是在目前条件下更是这样。武装斗争的必要性显得越来越清楚，现代修正主义者企图使人们忘记这一点，诬蔑和歪曲毛泽东同志关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的重要论断。”文章指出，毛泽东同志的亲密的战友林彪同志在他的《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中再次强调和发挥了这一论断。
