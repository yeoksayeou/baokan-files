The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally drafted by Chairman Mao Zedong, has been published for one year.

Practice over the past year has proven the correctness of the various points in this historic decision and the genius of Chairman Mao's foresight. On the first anniversary of the publication of the "Sixteen Points," we are witnesses, because we have personally seen how the iron broom of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a storm, has swept away all filth and mud, destroying one after another the reactionary bastions of the bourgeoisie, exposing, criticizing, and overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who have taken the capitalist and revisionist road, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the victory of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, are the greatest pride of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world. The revolutionary people of the whole world regard the 700 million Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong as their closest friends and the most ardent supporters of the progressive, revolutionary, and liberation cause of the peoples of all countries.

I

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is conducted under the dictatorship of the proletariat using the method of mass democracy. In this great revolutionary storm, hundreds of millions of laboring masses have studied the thoughts of Chairman Mao, with astonishing maturity and wisdom, implementing the line of "letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves" advocated by Chairman Mao, the line of "daring to take the lead, trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and unleashing the creative power of the masses." This mass democracy is a great combination of Mao Zedong Thought with the laboring masses, a very good form of greatly enhancing the revolutionary spirit of the masses. Without such mass democracy, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could not have been carried out as deeply and broadly as it is today.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, like the surging waves of the Yangtze River, have launched a great attack and glorious struggle to sweep away the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party who have degenerated and turned into capitalists in the field of political thought in China. In this unprecedented great storm, lively and vivid public debates and mass criticism and self-criticism have been carried out with great enthusiasm. Through these debates, not only has the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie been exposed, but the broad masses of the people have also been educated, their fighting spirit has been enhanced, and they have learned to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, to tell right from wrong, to distinguish between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, and to distinguish between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought. The whole of China is covered with big-character posters. Big-character posters have become a powerful whip for the revolutionary faction to lash the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. The criticism of 700 million people, the strong call of 700 million people to "smash the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie" and "long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," has shaken the mountains and echoed through the clouds, making the enemy tremble with fear and nowhere to hide.

These pathetic clowns, in the sharp eyes of the masses, have become pitiful creatures. Various enemies, not understanding the power and creativity of the masses, not understanding how much material force the broad masses of the people have when they grasp Mao Zedong Thought, have only hastened their own doom with their actions.

This once again proves the important thesis of Comrade Mao Zedong that "after the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shown to the world that the Communist Party of China is full of vitality, its revolutionary line is correct, and it is closely linked with the people; at the same time, it has shown that the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong are a powerful weapon in the hands of the masses. Only a truly Marxist-Leninist party like the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong can have such confidence in relying on the masses, dare to mobilize the masses to engage in the great revolutionary struggle, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to advance the cause of socialism and communism. If the Khrushchev revisionist clique were to try, to release the hands of the masses and abandon the savage bourgeois dictatorship over revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, even if it were for just one minute, the masses would rise up in revolt and beat these traitors, who have usurped the leadership of the Party and the state through various conspiracies and intrigues and are pushing forward the restoration of capitalism, until they are left without a single piece of armor.

II

Marx said, revolution is the locomotive of history. We are very pleased to see that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further promoted the development of productive forces. All sectors of the national economy have achieved magnificent achievements. Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" has become a great banner of victory and an ever-victorious march song.

In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, great socialist China has produced synthetic benzene and artificial insulin for the first time in the world, built the first oxygen furnace, and broken many world records. In the high tide of the Great Revolution, in consolidating the national defense of the People's Republic of China, new and great strides have been made: three nuclear tests have been successfully conducted, and recently a hydrogen bomb has been produced. This is a great victory for the revolutionary people of the whole world! This is a heavy blow to the two nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, who are trying to maintain their nuclear monopoly forever.

The glorious laboring masses of China, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have, in most provinces, completed or overfulfilled the state plan for the first half of 1967 ahead of schedule. The production and scientific front have also achieved a series of new great achievements. The modern revisionists and reactionaries of various countries shamelessly cry out that "production has been disrupted," etc. Poor fellows, let them envy!

The revolutionary furnace is forging a new type of person—revolutionaries who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have an internationalist spirit. This is one of the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory that makes the whole progressive humanity rejoice. The Chinese people of today, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have completely cast off vulgar tastes and personal interests. They think, work, and live with a revolutionary attitude, extending a hand of friendship to the revolutionary people of the whole world, advancing together with them in the great revolutionary struggle and in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Today, in the spiritual face of the whole of Chinese socialist society, the image of the Red Guards is particularly prominent. How excellent they are! The Red Guards, the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are like eagles soaring in the clouds, fearless of storms and rain. Together with workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, they, like thunder and lightning, have smashed the old world, smashed old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and established the four new things of the proletariat. In the struggle to smash the four old things and in the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the Red Guards are growing and tempering themselves. They have shown with their actions that they can hold high the baton of proletarian revolution and pass it on forever. The hope of the American imperialists to change the color of China is placed on the third generation of China, and their illusions have been shattered. The Party and Chairman Mao care very much for revolutionary youth, letting them temper themselves in the great waves of revolution, arming them with Marxist-Leninist thought, and cultivating them into steadfast fighters for the cause of communism. The thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong will surely triumph forever, and they will be passed down from generation to generation like the most precious things. This is a reliable guarantee.

III

About the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, its brilliant victories and its great international significance, many great works can be written.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has thoroughly smashed the enemies of Chinese socialism, dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. It has awakened the peoples of various countries and had a great impact on the world. For this reason, imperialism, the Khrushchev revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries have launched a frenzied movement to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Republic of China, and the glorious Communist Party of China.

The enemies of socialism—the modern revisionists and the reactionaries of various countries—fiercely attack Comrade Mao Zedong and his revolutionary thoughts. This savage attack shows the power of Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts and shows that the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong are spreading widely and deeply in the hearts of the people all over the world.

The revolutionary faction of the proletariat is fully aware that we do not expect the praise of imperialists, Khrushchev revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries. Their abuse vividly shows how disheartened they are by the brilliance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

But a sieve cannot cover the sun. No matter what tricks the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries play, they can never stop the peoples of various countries from understanding and supporting the purposes and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and learning from the brilliant example of the revolutionary faction of the Chinese proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its unique great attraction, has educated the peoples of various countries that there is an irreconcilable antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, either the proletariat is in power or the bourgeoisie is in power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has educated the peoples of various countries on how to deal with the bourgeoisie, the revisionist clique, and various counter-revolutionaries. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tells people how to prevent the revisionists from usurping power and how the revolutionary masses overthrow the revisionists who have usurped power. The immeasurable international significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution lies in this. This great revolution points out the correct path to the peoples of the Soviet Union and other countries where the revisionist traitor clique is in power, telling them how to get rid of the poisonous snake of revisionism and how to cut off the snake's head.

No matter how desperately imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries struggle, the great people of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary people of the whole world are ready to bury the stinking corpses of the American imperialists and their accomplices!

The revolutionary people of the world look to and cherish the great people of China, the great Communist Party of China, and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. They do not believe the rumors and slanders of the reactionaries and modern revisionists, but rather they love and admire the great socialist China even more, learn from it, and are inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the whole world, the sparks of people's revolution are turning into raging fires, and imperialism, reactionaries, and revisionism will be burned to death in this raging fire. No force and reactionary crusade can stop the surging tide of people's revolutionary wars in various countries.

Today, people's war has great significance, as Comrade Lin Biao said: "The more victorious the people's war in one place, the more it can tie up and consume more of the strength of American imperialism." "The spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary people is much stronger and more useful than the material atomic bomb.... This wild cow of American imperialism, which runs around everywhere, will eventually be burned to ashes in the people's war it has ignited itself."

The people of Albania are proud that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the great brotherly people of China, the great Communist Party of China, and its glorious leader, the close friend of the Albanian people, on the front line of building socialism and communism and fighting against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.

Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, said in congratulating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China: "The Albanian Labor Party congratulates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, a revolution whose purpose is to mercilessly strike at bourgeois and revisionist ideas in people's minds, in the cultural field, and in all aspects of domestic life, to fight against the class enemies and all open and hidden revisionists who attempt to drag the people's China back to the capitalist road, and to oppose American imperialism, Khrushchev revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries."

The members of the Albanian Labor Party and all the people of our country regard the brilliant victories achieved by the brotherly people of China in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great victories achieved in other aspects as their own victories. These victories inspire us, add new strength to us, and encourage us to forge ahead towards socialism and communism, bravely ride the waves, and smash the plots and tricks of imperialism and modern revisionism.

We, the people, feel very honored that the Party and people of Albania have an unbreakable revolutionary friendship and fighting unity with the glorious Communist Party of China and the 700 million Chinese people, and that the brotherly relationship with the people's China has been fully developed and strengthened, which is beneficial to the consolidation of the international communist movement, the revolutionary cause, and the socialist cause, and to the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The great friendship and fighting unity between our two peoples are unbreakable, because they are firmly based on Marxist-Leninist principles, were born and grew in the struggle against common enemies, have withstood various tests, and have shown their indestructible vitality.

Steel is tempered in fire, and true friends are tested in adversity. The friendship between our two peoples and parties has been tempered in adversity. This friendship is the friendship between peoples with common thoughts. This friendship was created by our two countries' Marxist-Leninist parties led by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. This friendship will be evergreen and eternal!

    无产阶级文化大革命的思想大放光芒
    阿尔巴尼亚　哈桑·贝特莱拉
    由毛泽东主席亲自主持制定的中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定（十六条），发表一周年了。
    一年来的实践，证明了这一历史性决定的各项论点的正确性和毛泽东主席的天才的预见。在十六条发表一年后的今天，我们就是见证人，因为我们亲眼看到，无产阶级文化大革命的铁扫帚，犹如暴风骤雨，荡涤着一切污垢浊泥，摧毁了一个又一个的资产阶级的反动堡垒，揭露、斗臭、斗倒了党内一小撮走资本主义和修正主义道路的罪恶昭彰的当权派，巩固了无产阶级专政。无产阶级文化大革命的这些伟大胜利，以毛泽东主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是中国人民和全世界革命人民最大的骄傲。全世界革命人民把七亿中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志，看作是他们最亲密的朋友和各国人民的进步、革命和解放事业的最热烈的支持者。
    一
    无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政之下运用群众大民主的方法进行的。在这场大革命的风暴中，亿万劳动群众大学毛泽东主席的思想，以惊人的成熟性和智慧贯彻了毛主席所说的让群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的路线，“敢”字当头、信任群众、依靠群众和放手发动群众创造力的路线。这种大民主，是毛泽东思想同劳动群众的大结合，是大大提高群众的革命精神的很好形式。没有这样的大民主，无产阶级文化大革命就不可能象目前所实际进行的那样深入、广阔地开展起来。
    广大的工农兵，广大的革命干部和革命的知识分子，高举毛泽东思想红旗，犹如长江巨浪，投入了横扫政治思想上蜕化变质、在中国搞资本主义复辟的党内资产阶级代表人物的大进攻和光荣战斗之中。在这场史无前例的大风暴中，十分热烈地开展了生动活泼的公开的大辩论和群众性的批评与自我批评。通过大辩论，不仅揭露了资产阶级反动路线，而且也教育了广大的人民群众，提高了他们的战斗精神，学会分清敌我，辨别是非，区别马列主义与修正主义，区别无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想。整个中国贴满了大字报，大字报成了革命派抽打反党反社会主义分子的有力鞭子。七亿人民的批判，七亿人民的“粉碎资产阶级反动路线”，“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁”的强大呼声，震动山河，响彻云霄，使敌人吓得无处躲藏。
    这些可悲的小丑，就是这样，在群众锐利的眼睛中，成了一些可怜虫。形形色色的敌人，不懂得群众力量和创造力，不懂得广大的人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想就有多大的物质力量，因此，他们的所作所为，只不过是加速自己的灭亡而已。
    这再一次证实了毛泽东同志的这一重要论断，即“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”
    无产阶级文化大革命向全世界表明，中国共产党是有生命力的，它的革命路线是正确的，它同人民有紧密的联系；同时表明，毛泽东同志的思想是群众手中的强大武器。只有象以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党这样真正的马列主义政党，才能这样有信心地依靠群众，敢于发动群众投入革命的伟大战斗，以巩固无产阶级专政，并把社会主义和共产主义的事业推向前进。如果赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团也来试一试，放开群众的手脚，放弃对革命群众和革命干部的野蛮的资产阶级专政，那怕是放弃一分钟，那群众就要起来造反，把这些使用种种阴谋诡计篡夺了党和国家领导权并加紧推行资本主义复辟的叛徒，打得片甲不留。
    二
    马克思说过，革命是历史的火车头。我们十分高兴地看到，无产阶级文化大革命进一步推动了生产力的发展。国民经济的各个部门都取得了宏伟的成就。毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的号召，成了胜利的伟大旗帜和永远阔步前进的凯歌。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中，伟大的社会主义中国在世界上首先生产出合成苯、人工合成胰岛素，建成了第一个氧气炉，打破了许多国际纪录。在大革命的高潮中，在巩固中华人民共和国的国防方面，向前迈出了新的巨大的步伐：三次核试验爆炸成功，最近又生产出了氢弹，这是全世界革命人民的何等巨大的胜利！这是对妄图永远保持核垄断的美苏两个核霸王的沉重打击。
    中国光荣的劳动群众，永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在绝大多数省份，提前完成或超额完成一九六七年上半年的国家计划，生产和科学战线也取得了一系列的新的伟大的成就。而现代修正主义者和各国反动派却恬不知耻地叫嚷什么“生产受到破坏”等等。可怜的家伙，让他们去嫉妒吧！
    革命的熔炉正在铸造新型的人——用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有国际主义精神的坚定的革命者。这是无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利之一，是使整个进步人类欢欣鼓舞的巨大胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来的今日的中国人民，完全摆脱了低级趣味和个人利益。他们以革命的姿态想问题、干工作、过生活，向全世界革命人民伸出了友谊之手，同他们一起在革命的伟大战斗中、在反帝反修的斗争中前进。
    今天，在整个中国的社会主义社会的精神面貌方面，红卫兵革命小将的形象十分突出。他们是多么优秀啊！红卫兵，无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中涌现出的闯将，好似云中翱翔的雄鹰，狂风暴雨毫不畏惧。他们同工农兵和革命干部一起，势如雷电，大破旧世界，大破旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的四新。在破四旧的斗争中，在捍卫毛主席的革命路线的斗争中，红卫兵成长着、锻炼着。他们用行动表明，他们能够高举无产阶级革命的接力棒，并永远传下去。美国帝国主义把中国改变颜色的希望寄托在中国的第三代身上，他们的幻想破灭了。党和毛主席十分关怀革命青年，让他们到革命的巨浪中去锻炼，用马列主义思想武装他们，把他们培养成为共产主义事业的坚定战士。毛泽东主席的思想必将永远胜利，它将象最珍贵的东西一样一代一代地传下去。这是可靠的保证。
    三
    关于无产阶级文化大革命，它的光辉胜利及其伟大的国际意义，能够写成许多巨著。
    无产阶级文化大革命彻底粉碎了中国的社会主义的敌人，有力地、狠狠地打击了帝国主义和现代修正主义。它唤起了各国人民，给全世界以巨大的影响。正因为这一点，帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义和各国反动派才掀起疯狂反对无产阶级文化大革命、反对中华人民共和国和光荣的中国共产党的运动。
    社会主义的敌人——现代修正主义者和各国反动派疯狂地攻击毛泽东同志及其革命思想。这种野蛮的攻击表明了毛泽东同志的思想的威力，表明了毛泽东同志的马列主义学说正在全世界广泛传播，深入人心。
    无产阶级革命派完全清楚，我们绝不期望帝国主义者、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和各国反动派的赞美。它们的谩骂生动地表明，无产阶级文化大革命的光辉使它们多么沮丧！
    但是筛子遮不住太阳。不管帝国主义者和各国反动派玩弄什么花招，永远也不能阻挡各国人民了解和支持无产阶级文化大革命的目的和原则，学习中国无产阶级革命派的光辉榜样。
    无产阶级文化大革命，以其特有的巨大的吸引力教育了各国人民，无产阶级和资产阶级之间存在着不可调和的对抗性的矛盾，或者是无产阶级掌权，或者是资产阶级掌权。无产阶级文化大革命教育了各国人民，应该怎样对待资产阶级、修正主义集团和形形色色的反革命分子。无产阶级文化大革命告诉人们，应该怎样防止修正主义篡夺政权和革命群众如何推翻掌握了政权的修正主义。无产阶级文化大革命的不可估量的国际意义就在于此。这场大革命给修正主义叛徒集团当权的苏联和其他一些国家的人民指出正确的道路，告诉他们应怎样摆脱修正主义的毒蛇和怎样砍断蛇头。
    不管帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行怎样的疯狂挣扎，用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民和全世界革命人民一道，已经准备好埋葬美帝及其同伙的腐臭尸体的坟墓！
    世界革命人民眼望着、心向着伟大的中国人民、伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志。他们不相信反动派和现代修正主义者的谣言和诽谤，相反，他们更加热爱和敬仰伟大的社会主义中国，学习并且受到无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞。在全世界，人民革命的星星之火，正在变为熊熊的烈火，帝国主义、反动派和修正主义将要烧死在这熊熊的烈火之中。没有任何力量和反动的十字军，能够阻止各国的人民革命战争的怒涛。
    今天，人民战争具有十分重大的意义，正如林彪同志所说：“一个地方的人民战争越是胜利地发展，就越是可以牵制和消耗美帝国主义更多的力量。”“革命人民的精神的原子弹，要比物质的原子弹强大得多，有用得多。……美帝国主义这只到处乱闯的野牛，终将在它自己点燃起来的人民战争的烈火中被烧成灰烬。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民感到自豪的是，我们和伟大的兄弟的中国人民、伟大的中国共产党及其光荣的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的知心朋友，并肩站在建设社会主义与共产主义和反对帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义斗争的最前线。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖恩维尔·霍查同志在祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命时说：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命，这场革命的目的是无情打击人们头脑中的、文化领域和国内生活各个方面的资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，斗争妄图把人民中国拉回资本主义道路的阶级敌人和一切公开的与隐蔽的修正主义分子，反对美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义和各国反动派。”
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党员和我国全体人民，把兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的辉煌胜利，在其他方面所取得的伟大胜利看作是自己的胜利。这些胜利鼓舞着我们，给我们增添了新的力量，激励我们勇往直前，奔向社会主义和共产主义，勇敢地乘风破浪，去粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义的阴谋诡计。
    我们人民感到十分荣幸的是，阿尔巴尼亚党和人民同光荣的中国共产党和七亿中国人民有着牢不可破的革命友谊和战斗团结，同人民中国的兄弟关系得到了全面的发展并且日益加强，这种兄弟关系有利于巩固国际共产主义运动、革命事业和社会主义事业，有利于马列主义的胜利。
    我们两国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结是牢不可破的，因为它牢固地建立在马列主义的原则上，是在反对共同敌人的斗争中诞生和成长的，它经受了各种考验，表现出它的不可摧毁的生命力。
    钢从火中炼，患难见知交。我们两国人民和两党之间的友谊在患难中经过考验，得到锤炼。这种友谊是具有共同思想的人民之间的友谊。这种友谊是由以毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志为首的我们两国的马列主义的党缔造的。这种友谊将万古长青，永世长存！
