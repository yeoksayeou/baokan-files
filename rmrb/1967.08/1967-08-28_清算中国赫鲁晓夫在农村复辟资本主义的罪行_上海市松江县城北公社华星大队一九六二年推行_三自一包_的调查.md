	How did this evil wind arise?

	For seventeen years since liberation, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in our rural areas has been fierce. One road is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, which firmly leads the hundreds of millions of peasants forward on the socialist path. The other road is the reactionary line of the capitalist roaders within the Party, who attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside. The evil wind of "Three Selfs and One Contract" (referring to keeping more private plots, engaging more in free markets, operating more self-responsible enterprises, and contracting production to households) that swept through the countryside in 1962 was blown by the capitalist roaders within the Party. They represent the interests of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, catering to the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, shouting, "During the transitional period, all methods that benefit the mobilization of the peasants' production enthusiasm can be used. We don't need to say which method is the best and the only one." They brazenly ordered, "In industry, we must retreat sufficiently; in agriculture, we must also retreat sufficiently, including contracting production to households and individual farming!"

	The struggle between these two lines is equally fierce within the Shanghai Party. Revolutionary leaders led by Comrade Ke Qingshi firmly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, advocating the development of socialist collective economy and resolutely opposing and resisting the evil wind of "Three Selfs and One Contract." However, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Municipal Committee followed the capitalist roaders within the Party, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They mimicked their master's tone, saying, "Communism has not been achieved, and socialism has been messed up, so we have to introduce some capitalism." Behind Comrade Ke Qingshi's back, they arranged for investigations in the suburbs on "whether responsibility fields can be implemented" and "which can implement contracting production to households," openly advocating individual farming. Under their incitement, the suburbs of Shanghai once again saw the evil wind of "Three Selfs and One Contract," with ghosts and monsters emerging, and capitalist tendencies resurfacing.

	Huaxing Production Brigade is a brigade in Chengbei Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai. In 1962, this brigade was also affected by this evil wind and implemented "Three Selfs and One Contract." At that time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee, following their master's black instructions, used "improving management" as a cover to implement "contracting production to fields and responsibility to households" in this brigade, effectively implementing "contracting production to households." They also established a "production reward and compensation" system: rewarding 60% of the surplus production and compensating 60% of the deficit production. They first conducted a pilot in the Eighth Production Team and then expanded it to eight production teams (the entire brigade has ten production teams). From July to October, when Comrade Ke Qingshi discovered and corrected it, it lasted about three months. This brigade was a typical team severely affected in the suburbs of Shanghai.

	Who supports "Three Selfs and One Contract"? Who opposes it?

	Chairman Mao taught us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Before the implementation, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the brigade, along with a part of rich middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts, created public opinion. They falsely claimed, "The people's commune was established too early, collective farming is not as good as individual farming." "Contracting production to households is good, everyone eats according to their abilities, and production enthusiasm is high." They spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Outside, the fields have already been divided to households, why not in Huaxing?" They demanded the division of fields. After forcibly implementing the so-called "contracting production to fields and responsibility to households," a rich peasant was overjoyed and said to everyone, "Now, where is there exploitation? Everyone eats by labor. Contracting production to households, responsibility to individuals, can mobilize everyone's enthusiasm." Look, his words are exactly the same as the capitalist roaders within the Party saying, "It is beneficial to mobilize the peasants' production enthusiasm."

	The "enthusiasm" mobilized by the capitalist roaders within the Party is exactly that of these people. They "enthusiastically" demanded the return of agricultural tools that had already been priced and returned to the team. A rich peasant in the Second Team even demanded the return of oxen and tools from the production team, arrogantly saying, "Next year, I will farm by myself." Another rich peasant in the Second Team even dismantled the shed and took it for himself, preparing for "individual farming." They also "enthusiastically" divided fields and set production and labor quotas at the fieldheads. A bad element in the Seventh Team, upon hearing about the division of fields, immediately led the cadres to measure the fields, setting production and labor quotas busily. They "enthusiastically" expanded private plots and engaged in speculation and profiteering. This is a thorough capitalist "enthusiasm," completely mobilized by the capitalist roaders within the Party.

	What about the poor and lower-middle peasants? The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly resisted. They listened to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely walked the socialist path. They did not buy the capitalist roaders within the Party's talk and resisted this evil wind. They said, "The more difficulties, the more we should walk the collectivization path," firmly opposing "contracting production to households." Poor and lower-middle peasants with less labor and capital said, "This way, we have to take care of the house and the fields, carry heavy loads, and hire labor. It is not beneficial for us poor and lower-middle peasants." Some adopted a resistant attitude, did not attend meetings, and continued to help each other in labor, not distinguishing between each other, always trying to manage the collective fields first.

	Who benefits from "Three Selfs and One Contract"? Who suffers?

	Chairman Mao taught us, "The capitalist tendencies among the rich peasants are serious. As long as we relax political work among the peasants in the cooperativization movement and even in a very long period afterward, capitalist tendencies will surge."

	First, observe the land division. For example, the Fifth Team has a total of 291 mu of land, and the result of allocating "responsibility fields" is:

	Four households of rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries (19 people, 7 labor forces) received 62 mu, accounting for 21.3% of the total land area, averaging 3.2 mu per person.

	Six households of rich middle peasants (32 people, 13 labor forces) received 139 mu, accounting for 48% of the total land area, averaging 4.3 mu per person.

	Twelve households of poor and lower-middle peasants (44 people, 9 labor forces) received 90 mu, accounting for 30.9% of the total land area, averaging 2.05 mu per person.

	From the above investigation, it can be seen that in terms of land area alone, poor and lower-middle peasants received one-third less land than rich peasants and half less than rich middle peasants. Rich peasants and rich middle peasants occupied 70% of the land area, while poor and lower-middle peasants only occupied 30%. What class line is implemented by the capitalist roaders within the Party, and for which class do they serve? Isn't it clear?

	During the implementation process, it can be seen who benefits and who suffers. A rich peasant in the Second Team did not work himself but engaged in extensive speculation and profiteering outside, reaping huge profits. He hired workers to cultivate the 36 mu of "responsibility fields" allocated to him, engaging in exploitation, and was still rewarded 40-plus yuan at the end of the year. This team had a total of two households of rich peasants and six households of rich middle peasants, who received a total of over 300 yuan in rewards at the end of the year. A rich middle peasant in the Eighth Team even "rented" a poor peasant's private plot in the team, giving only 20 jin of wheat and 5 jin of rice for a year, engaging in exploitation. A rich middle peasant in the Fourth Team did not farm but engaged in speculation. He made a trip to Hangzhou to sell fertilizer and reaped over a thousand yuan in profits.

	Those who suffered were the poor and lower-middle peasants. Because poor and lower-middle peasants generally lacked labor and capital, the "responsibility fields" allocated to them were difficult to complete. However, they had deep class feelings for the collective economy of the people's commune. Seeing that the large fields could not complete the tasks, they were very anxious. A poor peasant in the Fifth Team, with a husband and wife managing 25 mu of "responsibility fields," could not complete the task because the husband had a carbuncle on his finger and the wife was pregnant. They were so anxious that they had to ask for help, resulting in a loss of over 100 labor days and 100-plus jin of grain, becoming a chronic debtor until 1965 when they finally repaid. A poor peasant in the Second Team, with a family of four, "contracted" 20 mu, but because the mother was sick and the children were young, only one person worked, resulting in 8 mu of wasteland and a loss of 94 yuan at the end of the year. This team's six households of poor and lower-middle peasants had a total loss of over 400 yuan at the end of the year. Poor and lower-middle peasants reflected, "Contracting production to households is a soft knife that kills without blood, benefiting the landlords and rich peasants, harming us poor and lower-middle peasants."

	What road is this, after all?

	Chairman Mao taught us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." Under the orders of the capitalist roaders within the Party, the capitalist forces in this brigade were desperately fighting against the revolutionary forces. Ultimately, their goal was to seize our proletarian power and the power of the poor and lower-middle peasants. A rich peasant jumped out and pointed at the cadres' noses, saying, "Now that production is contracted to fields and land to households, there is no need for cadres to lead." They openly resisted the brigade's production arrangements, did not obey the allocation of labor, did not care about the quality of agricultural work, rushed to use water and fertilizers, ran around everywhere, and engaged in capitalist operations. They also demanded more. A rich peasant even proposed the slogan of "full reward and full compensation," demanding to increase the original ratio of 60% to 100%.

	The capitalist roaders within the Party focused on material incentives and money as the commander, desperately opposing the prominence of proletarian politics. The result of implementing "Three Selfs and One Contract" was that this brigade once saw no one managing politics, no one doing ideological work, meetings could not be held, capitalist tendencies surged, private plots were expanded by dozens of mu, large fields were wasted by dozens of mu, the brigade's livestock farm was cut down, and phenomena of free hiring and selling labor appeared. The socialist collective economy was destroyed.

	Poor and lower-middle peasants saw this scene and were very angry. They said, "There must be bad people playing tricks." A female poor peasant in the Fifth Team said, "If this continues, within a year, a team will have to walk two roads. Rich peasants will become exploiters, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice."

	Due to the invasion of this evil wind, the grain production of the brigade that year saw a significant decrease, the procurement task was not completed, and during the Spring Festival, the state returned part of the rationed grain as food and seeds. Public accumulation funds and public welfare funds could not be accumulated, and many poor and lower-middle peasants became debtors. A poor peasant in the Eighth Team said, "'Three Selfs and One Contract' is a road to poverty for thousands of families and wealth for one, we poor and lower-middle peasants must not walk this road!"

	Only socialism can save China

	At this critical moment, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, issued a great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country, "Never forget class struggle," smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration plot of the capitalist roaders within the Party. Under Chairman Mao's call, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Huaxing Brigade united to repel the capitalist forces, and the collective economy of the people's commune was consolidated.

	Chairman Mao taught us, "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, where will China go? Towards capitalism or socialism? ... The facts have answered this question: Only socialism can save China." The capitalist roaders within the Party blew the wind of "individual farming," advocated "four freedoms," and promoted "Three Selfs and One Contract," attacking the three red banners. Their goal was to achieve the restoration of capitalism and lead China towards capitalism. This is a thorough counter-revolutionary act. Currently, Huaxing Brigade, like the rural areas across the country, is deeply carrying out a grand revolutionary criticism movement. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, set up battlefields in the fields and courtyards, verbally and in writing, fiercely attacking China's Khrushchev. They hate China's Khrushchev's heinous crime of attempting to drag the countryside back to the old road to the core and are determined to pull this arch-enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants down from the horse, fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink.

    清算中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪行
    ——上海市松江县城北公社华星大队一九六二年推行“三自一包”的调查
    上海社会科学院革命造反兵团历史研究所“反修”战斗队
    这股妖风是怎样刮起来的？
    解放十七年来，我国农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争一直在激烈地进行着。一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚定地引导亿万农民向着社会主义大道前进；一条是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线，妄图在农村实现资本主义复辟。一九六二年在农村刮起的“三自一包”（指多留自留田，多搞自由市场，多搞自负盈亏企业，包产到户）这股妖风，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派刮起来的。他代表地主、资产阶级的利益，适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的需要，叫嚷“过渡时期一切有利于调动农民生产积极性的办法都可以。不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的”。他悍然下令：“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户、单干！”
    这两条路线的斗争，反映在上海党内，同样非常激烈。以柯庆施同志为首的革命领导干部，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，竭力主张发展社会主义集体经济，坚决反对和抵制“三自一包”的妖风。但是，旧市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，却紧跟党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，反对毛主席的革命路线。他们学着主子的腔调说：“共产主义没有搞好，社会主义反被搞乱了，不得不来一些资本主义。”并背着柯庆施同志，布置调查郊区“搞责任田行不行”，“那些可以实行包产到户”，明目张胆鼓吹单干。在他们煽动之下，上海郊区一度刮起了“三自一包”的妖风，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，资本主义自发倾向又泛滥起来。
    华星大队是上海松江县城北公社的一个大队。一九六二年，这个大队也一度受到这股妖风的侵袭，推行过“三自一包”。当时上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派秉承他们主子的黑指示，以“改善经营管理”为名，在这个大队搞了个“定产到田，责任到户”，实行了“包产到户”，同时又规定了“包产奖赔”制度：超产奖励超产部分的百分之六十，减产赔偿减产部分的百分之六十。他们先在第八生产队“试点”，后在八个生产队（全大队共十个生产队）推广。从七月起到十月被柯庆施同志发现纠正为止，前后约三个月。这个大队是上海郊区受害较为严重的一个典型队。
    “三自一包”谁拥护？谁反对？
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”早在推行之前，大队里的地、富、反、坏和一部分有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，就大肆制造舆论。他们胡说什么：“人民公社办早了，集体不如单干好”。“包产到户好，大家凭本事吃饭，生产积极性高”。他们到处放空气，说什么“外头早已分到户，华星为啥不分田？”吵着要分田。在强行推行所谓“定产到田，责任到户”后，有个富农高兴极了，逢人便说：“现在哪里还有剥削，大家靠劳动吃饭。包产到户，责任到人，可以调动大家的积极性。”看，他讲的话和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派讲的“有利于调动农民生产积极性”，不是一模一样吗？
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派调动起来的，就是这帮人的“积极性”。他们“积极”向生产队讨还已经折价归队的农具。二队有个富农竟向生产队索还耕牛和农具，嚣张地说：“开年我要自己种田了。”二队另一个富农竟把车棚拆去，占为己有，准备“单干”派用场。他们还“积极”到田头分田，定产定工。七队有个坏分子一听说要分田，就脚不停蹄地领着干部去踏田，定产又定工，大忙特忙起来。他们“积极”扩大自留田，大搞投机贩卖。这是彻头彻尾的走资本主义道路的“积极性”，完全是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一手调动起来的。
    贫下中农怎样呢？绝大多数的贫下中农进行了坚决的抵制。他们听的是毛主席的话，坚定地走社会主义道路。他们对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一套就是不买帐，顶住了这股歪风。他们说，“越是困难越要走集体化的道路”，坚决反对“包产到户”。劳力少、资金缺的贫下中农说：“这样弄法，既要顾屋里，又要顾田里，挑又挑勿动，碰工要请人，对我们贫下中农是不利的。”有的采取抵制态度，开会不出席，劳动仍是互相帮助，不分彼此，总是想法先把集体的田弄好。
    “三自一包”谁得“好处”？谁吃苦？
    毛主席教导我们：“富裕农民中的资本主义倾向是严重的。只要我们在合作化运动中，乃至以后一个很长的时期内，稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来。”
    先从分地观察。如五队共有土地二百九十一亩，分配“责任田”的结果是：
    四户富农、反革命分子（十九人，七个劳动力）分到六十二亩，占土地总面积百分之二十一点三，平均每人三点二亩。
    六户富裕中农（三十二人，十三个劳动力），分到一百三十九亩，占土地总面积百分之四十八，平均每人四点三亩。
    十二户贫下中农（四十四人，九个劳动力），分到九十亩，占土地总面积百分之三十点九，平均每人二点零五亩。
    从上面的调查可以看出，单就土地面积来说，贫下中农要比富农少分三分之一，比富裕中农少分二分之一，富农和富裕中农占的土地面积高达百分之七十，贫下中农只占到百分之三十。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派贯彻的是一条什么阶级路线，为哪个阶级服务，不是看得一清二楚了吗？加以富农和富裕中农一般劳动力都比较多，比较强，资金足，优势已被他们夺去，打击的是贫下中农。
    在推行过程中更可看出谁得“好处”，谁吃苦头。二队有个富农自己不劳动，在外大搞投机贩卖，牟取暴利，把分配给他的三十六亩“责任田”雇工耕种，进行剥削，到年终还奖励他四十多元。这个队一共二户富农、六户富裕中农，年终共得奖达三百余元。八队有个富裕中农甚至把队里一个贫农的自留田“租进”，一年只给二十斤麦、五斤米，进行剥削。四队有个富裕中农不干农活，专搞投机倒把。他一次去杭州贩卖化肥，就获取暴利上千元。
    吃到苦头的是贫下中农。由于贫下中农一般都缺少劳动力，缺少资金，所以分配给他们的“责任田”都难以完成任务。但是，他们对人民公社集体经济有着深厚的阶级感情，看到大田的任务完不成就非常着急。五队有户贫农，夫妻两人要管二十五亩“责任田”。因为男的手指生了疔疮，女的又在怀孕，完不成任务，急得没办法，只好请人来支援，结果赔了一百多个人工和一百多斤粮食，变成了常年透支户，直到一九六五年才还清。二队有户贫农，一家四口，“包产”二十亩，因为母亲生病，孩子还小，只有一人劳动，结果荒掉了八亩，年终还赔产九十四元。这个队里的六户贫下中农，年终一共赔产达四百多元。贫下中农反映说：“包产到户是一把杀人不见血的软刀子，‘好’的是地主富农，害的是我们贫下中农。”
    这究竟走的是哪条道路？
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的指使下，这个大队的资本主义势力就是在拚死地和革命势力作斗争。归根结底，他们的目的就是要夺我们无产阶级的权，夺贫下中农的权。有一个富农跳出来指着干部的鼻子说：“现在定产到田，土地到户了，用不着干部领导了。”他们公然反抗大队的生产布置，不服从劳动力的调配，不顾农活质量，抢放水，抢肥料，到处乱跑，搞资本主义经营。他们还得寸进尺。有一个富农竟然提出“全奖全赔”的口号，要求把原来规定的奖赔百分之六十的比例提高到百分之一百。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派专搞物质刺激、钞票挂帅，拚命反对突出无产阶级政治。“三自一包”推行的结果，使这个大队一度出现政治无人管，思想工作无人做，会开不起来，资本主义自发倾向泛滥，自留田被扩大了好几十亩，大田荒掉了几十亩，大队饲养场也被砍掉了，出现了自由雇工剥削和出卖劳力的现象。社会主义集体经济遭到了破坏。
    贫下中农看到这种情景都非常气愤。他们说：“这里面一定有坏人在搞鬼。”五队有个女贫农说：“这样下去，不消一年，一个队里就要走两条路。富裕农民变成剥削鬼，我们贫下中农要吃二遍苦了。”
    由于这股妖风的侵袭，这一年大队的粮食产量大幅度减产，征购任务没有完成，过春节的时候国家又返回一部分统销粮作为口粮和种籽，公积金、公益金无法积累，贫下中农有不少成了透支户。八队一个贫农说：“‘三自一包’是一条千家穷、一家富的阎王路，我们贫下中农万万不可走！”
    只有社会主义能够救中国
    就在这个关键时刻，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，向全党全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，粉碎了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命复辟阴谋。在毛主席的号召下，华星大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，一致奋起击退了资本主义势力，人民公社集体经济得到了巩固。
    毛主席教导我们：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？……事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大刮“单干”风，提倡“四大自由”，鼓吹“三自一包”，攻击三面红旗，其目的就是实现资本主义复辟，把中国引向资本主义。这是彻头彻尾的反革命行为。目前，华星大队和全国农村一样，正在深入开展一场声势浩大的革命大批判运动。广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，在田间场头摆开阵地，口诛笔伐，向中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。他们对中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图把农村拉回老路的滔天罪行，恨之入骨，决心要把这个贫下中农的死对头拉下马，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
