The brave American blacks have launched armed struggles against violence and have risen up in rebellion. The flames of struggle burn more fiercely, and the White House is in a state of panic. Revolutionary people around the world cannot help but applaud.

Four years ago, the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, issued the "Statement Supporting the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism." Chairman Mao scientifically analyzed the development of the black people's struggle in the United States, pointed out the direction of the black people's struggle, and gave a fatal blow to the racial discrimination policy of U.S. imperialism and the various fallacies spread by modern revisionists on the issue of the black people's struggle.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle."

The bloody history of oppression, enslavement, exploitation, and humiliation of blacks by the U.S. reactionary ruling clique, as well as the living reality, ironically prove this brilliant truth.

The U.S. ruling clique has always been the sworn enemy of the blacks. One of the most shameful episodes in the rise of U.S. imperialism is the trafficking and enslavement of blacks, using the blood and tears, heads, and corpses of blacks to build the paradise of the U.S. rulers. The so-called "liberation" of blacks in the North-South War was merely a means for capitalists to seize cheap black labor. As soon as the smoke of war cleared, the northern capitalists and southern landlords immediately formed a reactionary alliance, intensifying racial discrimination against blacks. The American blacks and the American ruling class have long been sworn enemies.

The ultimate root of racial discrimination is capitalist exploitation. The trafficking of black slaves is one of the main sources of the original accumulation of American capitalism, direct slavery is the basis for the development of American bourgeois industry, and the system of racial discrimination is the source of superprofits for American monopoly capital. Monopoly capitalists use various tricks to make the average wages of blacks only one-third to one-half of whites, thereby extracting an annual total of 40 to 80 billion dollars in superprofits. From this, it can be seen that the system of racial discrimination is entirely a product of the need for American monopoly capital to cruelly exploit blacks.

Those who implement racial discrimination and benefit from it are only a small group of white rulers, not the broad masses of white people. The broad masses of white people are also victims. While the white rulers are ruthlessly oppressing blacks, they are also ruthlessly exploiting the white laboring masses.

Chairman Mao said: "In the United States, it is the reactionary ruling clique among the white race that oppresses the blacks. They absolutely cannot represent the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened people who make up the absolute majority of the white race."

Many examples in American reality can illustrate that the enemy of American blacks is also the mortal enemy of the American proletariat and all white laboring people.

Racial discrimination is also the most insidious means used by the U.S. ruling clique to divide the American working class and maintain their rule. They portray the black issue as a racial issue, obscuring its class struggle essence. On the one hand, they attempt to incite white chauvinism with "racial theory," luring the broad masses of people into racial disputes; on the other hand, they attempt to shift the responsibility for racial discrimination to the American people, diverting the target of the black struggle, splitting the entire American working class, including blacks, and thus achieving their shameful plot of "divide and rule."

In summary, racial discrimination is a fundamental need of the U.S. reactionary ruling clique, a combination of national oppression and class oppression, and its fundamental nature is class oppression. Therefore, to eliminate racial oppression, it is necessary to eliminate class oppression and the imperialist system.

By grasping the class struggle as the key, one can see that the U.S. reactionary ruling clique is the main enemy of the blacks, while the broad masses of American laboring people are reliable friends of the blacks. Only in this way can all possible forces be united to the greatest extent, and the enemy be isolated and struck to the greatest extent, thereby leading the black struggle to final victory.

U.S. imperialism is not only the greatest exploiter and oppressor of American blacks and the broad laboring people but also the greatest exploiter and oppressor of the people of all countries in the world. The struggle of American blacks has received strong support from the anti-American struggle of people around the world. The struggle of American blacks is bound to be victorious.

Let the imperialists and their various defenders cry in the victory song of the American black struggle!

    种族问题实质上是阶级问题
    首都红代会外交学院革命造反兵团
    英勇的美国黑人展开武装抗暴斗争，起来造反了。斗争烈火越烧越旺，白宫惊恐万状，全世界的革命人民无不为之拍手叫好。
    四年以前，世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》。毛主席科学地分析了美国黑人斗争的发展，指出了黑人斗争的道路。这个具有历史意义的光辉文献，给美帝国主义的种族歧视政策和现代修正主义者在黑人斗争问题上散布的种种谬论，以致命的打击。
    毛主席指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”
    美国反动统治集团对黑人血淋淋的压迫、奴役、剥削和凌辱的历史与活生生的现实，铁一般地证实了这一光辉的真理。
    美国统治集团，从来就是黑人不共戴天的敌人。美帝国主义最可耻的发家史之一，就是对黑人的贩卖和奴役，用黑人的血和泪，头颅和尸骨建立了美国统治者的天堂。曾经标榜“解放”黑人的南北战争，只不过是为资本家攫取黑人廉价劳动力。战争的硝烟未散，北部资本家和南部地主马上结成反动同盟，变本加厉地对黑人推行种族歧视制度。美国黑人和美国统治阶级早已结下了血海深仇。
    种族歧视的最终根源，是资本主义剥削。黑奴贩卖是美国资本主义原始积累的主要来源之一，直接奴隶制是美国资产阶级工业发展的基础，而种族歧视制度则是美国垄断资本超额利润的源泉。垄断资本家使用各种花招，使黑人平均工资只及白人的三分之一到二分之一，从而榨取了每年总数竟达四十亿到八十亿美元的超额利润。由此可见，种族歧视制度，完全是出于美国垄断资本残酷剥削黑人的需要。
    实行种族歧视并从中得到好处的，只是一小撮白人统治者，而不是广大白人群众，广大白人群众同样是受害者。白人统治者在残酷地压迫黑人的同时，也在残酷地剥削白人劳动群众。
    毛主席说：“在美国压迫黑人的，只是白色人种中的反动统治集团。他们绝不能代表白色人种中占绝大多数的工人、农民、革命的知识分子和其他开明人士。”
    美国现实生活中的许多例子都可说明，美国黑人的敌人，同时也是美国无产阶级和一切白人劳动人民的死敌。
    种族歧视又是美国统治集团分裂美国工人阶级维护统治的最阴险的手段。他们把黑人问题说成是种族问题，抹杀它的阶级斗争的实质。一方面，是企图以“种族论”煽起白种沙文主义，诱使广大人民卷入种族纠纷；另一方面，是企图把种族歧视的责任推给美国广大人民，转移黑人斗争目标，分裂包括黑人在内的整个美国工人阶级，从而达到“分而治之”的可耻阴谋。
    综上所述，种族歧视就是美国反动统治集团根本利益的需要，种族歧视是民族压迫和阶级压迫的混合体，其根本性质是阶级压迫。因此，要消灭种族压迫，就必须消灭阶级压迫，消灭帝国主义制度。
    抓住阶级斗争这个纲，就可以认清美国反动统治集团是黑人的主要敌人，而广大美国劳动人民则是黑人的可靠朋友。只有这样，才能最大限度地团结一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立和打击敌人，从而把黑人斗争引向最后胜利。
    美帝国主义不仅是美国黑人和广大劳动人民的最大剥削者和压迫者，也是世界各国人民的最大剥削者和压迫者。美国黑人斗争得到了全世界人民反美斗争的有力支持。美国黑人的斗争是一定要胜利的。
    让帝国主义及其形形色色的辩护士们在美国黑人斗争的胜利凯歌中哭泣吧！
