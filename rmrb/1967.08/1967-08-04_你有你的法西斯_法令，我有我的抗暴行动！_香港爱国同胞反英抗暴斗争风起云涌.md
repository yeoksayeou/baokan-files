“You have your fascist ‘orders,’ we have our struggle against violence!” The heroic patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong have, in recent days, fearlessly and unyieldingly carried out their struggle against British violence, despite the brutal suppression by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities.

According to the Hong Kong British radio station, in the two days of July 29th and 30th, the Hong Kong British authorities illegally arrested 57 patriotic compatriots in various parts of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The Hong Kong British fascist authorities attempted to suppress the patriotic compatriots, who are in the midst of a surging struggle against British violence, through maddened repression. However, while the Hong Kong British authorities were carrying out their maddened large-scale suppression and arrests, anti-British and anti-violence slogans appeared everywhere in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Anti-British and anti-violence leaflets were flying everywhere, and big-character posters were blooming everywhere. Squads of patriotic youth took to the streets, performing anti-British and anti-violence programs. They enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, praised the heroic spirit of the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots in their struggle against British violence, and severely denounced the evil British imperialism. They attracted thousands of patriotic compatriots, greatly boosting the morale of the patriotic compatriots in their struggle against British violence. A student art troupe performed “The Small Trader’s Indictment” in Shek Kip Mei for the small traders who were suffering deeply, stirring up the strong hatred of the patriotic small traders towards British imperialism. They said: The British imperialists bully us like this, we must fight them down, fight them to the end! A combat team named “Hong Kong and Kowloon Pioneer Guerrilla Squad” wrote huge anti-British and anti-violence slogans on the walls of the Hong Kong British “Public Works Department” with paint. The Hong Kong British police hurriedly went to erase them, but the brave youths threw down bundles of leaflets from above their heads. The patriotic compatriots eagerly picked them up, greatly deflating the arrogance of British imperialism.

On the day after the Hong Kong British authorities attacked the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile and Dyeing Industry Workers’ Union—the 30th of July—the textile and dyeing workers rushed back to the union hall to hold a meeting. They angrily denounced the Hong Kong British authorities’ heinous crimes of attacking the union and its affiliated branches and welfare departments, as well as shooting dead the textile and dyeing worker Su Quan on the 26th. The union’s committee against Hong Kong British persecution issued a statement, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British authorities’ wanton tearing up of the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and the destruction of the union and the kidnapping of workers. The statement said: There is violent oppression, and there is violent resistance. We textile and dyeing workers fully understand how to respond to the British imperialists.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Lathe and Grinding Workers’ Union’s committee against Hong Kong British persecution also issued a statement, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British thugs’ serious political provocation of tearing down the national flag of the People’s Republic of China hanging in the union welfare department and tearing up the portrait of Chairman Mao in the book “Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong.”

The 60,000 Hong Kong workers who are currently carrying out a united general strike felt greatly encouraged upon receiving the telegram of condolences and the remittance of 10 million Hong Kong dollars sent by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The striking workers said: This is Chairman Mao’s affectionate care for us. The support of the working class of our motherland has made our confidence stronger and our fighting spirit more soaring. We will definitely hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the struggle against British violence to the end.

    “你有你的法西斯‘法令’，我有我的抗暴行动！”
    香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争风起云涌
    新华社香港二日电　“你有你的法西斯‘法令’，我有我的抗暴行动！”英雄的香港爱国同胞连日来不怕港英法西斯当局的暴力镇压，不屈不挠地开展反英抗暴斗争。
    据港英电台供认，在七月二十九日和三十日两天内，港英当局在港九各地非法逮捕了五十七位爱国同胞。
    港英法西斯当局妄图用疯狂的镇压来压倒正在风起云涌地进行反英抗暴斗争的爱国同胞，但是，就在港英进行疯狂的大镇压、大搜捕的同时，港九各地反英抗暴标语到处出现，反英抗暴传单漫天飞舞，反英抗暴大字报遍地开花。一队队爱国青年走上街头，演出反英抗暴节目。他们热情宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的英雄气概，无情地讨伐万恶的英帝国主义。他们吸引了数以千计的爱国同胞，极大地鼓舞了爱国同胞反英抗暴的斗志。有一个学生文艺演出队在石硖尾为苦难深重的小贩演出《小贩的控诉》，激起了爱国小贩们仇视英帝国主义的强烈感情。他们说：英帝国主义者如此欺负我们，我们一定要把它斗垮，斗臭！一支以“港九先锋游击队”命名的战斗队，在港英“工务局”的围墙上用油漆书写巨型的反英抗暴标语，港英警察慌忙前往涂抹，勇敢的青年们就在他们的头上把大叠传单撒下来，爱国同胞们争相拾阅，大灭港英帝国主义的威风。
    在港英当局袭击港九纺织染业职工总会的第二天——七月三十日，纺织染工人纷纷奔回会所开会，愤怒声讨港英袭击工会和所属支会、福利部，以及在二十六日枪杀纺织染工人苏全的滔天罪行。这个工会的反对港英迫害斗争委员会发表声明，对港英当局恣意撕毁我们的伟大领袖毛主席的像以及捣毁工会和绑架工人的罪行提出最最强烈的抗议。声明说：有暴力压迫，就有暴力反抗。我们纺织染工人完全懂得怎样回答英帝国主义者。
    港九车床打磨职工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会也发表声明，对港英暴徒扯下工会福利部悬挂的中华人民共和国国旗，撕毁《毛主席语录》一书内的毛主席像的严重政治挑衅行为提出了最严重的抗议。
    正在胜利进行联合大罢工的六万香港工人，在收到中华全国总工会打来的慰问电和随电汇来的港币一千万元后，感到无比鼓舞。罢工工人表示：这是毛主席对我们的亲切关怀。祖国工人阶级对我们的有力支援，使我们的信心更强，斗志更加昂扬，我们一定要更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
