The great proletarian cultural revolution, which has world-historical significance, is now entering the decisive stage of great criticism and great struggle. The unprecedentedly broad and profoundly significant mass movement of revolutionary criticism is pushing the great proletarian cultural revolution in China to a new high tide.

Over the past year, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have displayed the great fearlessness of revolutionaries, daring to pull the emperor off his horse. They have exposed and overthrown the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with their agents in various regions and departments. The revolutionary people, with the great wisdom and courage of the proletariat, have smashed one after another the reactionary strongholds of the bourgeoisie and are cleansing the muddy waters representing the old forces. The situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution is excellent.

The great victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution has driven a handful of class enemies into the abyss of total annihilation. However, as Chairman Mao has said, "The most die-hard elements among these people will never admit their defeat," and "the class enemy will definitely seek opportunities to reveal themselves."

Recently, a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, who are taking the capitalist road, manipulated and colluded with a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" and "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" who persisted in the bourgeois reactionary line. They launched a ferocious attack on the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They, disregarding everything, went into battle bare-chested, attempting to stir up a small storm on this land. Their aim was to use various efforts to restore and maintain the old forces and old order of the bourgeoisie, attempting to establish bourgeois dictatorship and restore capitalism in the Wuhan area.

From the events in Wuhan, we can see some problems of universal significance: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are never willing to accept their defeat. They always look for opportunities to counterattack the revolutionary forces. Moreover, their frenzy is precisely due to their failure, which has been intensified a hundredfold. They use various methods, find all kinds of excuses, and manipulate a handful of bad leaders in organizations like the "Million Heroes" and "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" in the Wuhan area to instigate armed struggles, engage in beating, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, besiege the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, attack revolutionary mass organizations, sabotage proletarian dictatorship, sabotage great democracy under proletarian dictatorship, sabotage socialist production, and sabotage the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution. They also spread rumors, deceive part of the masses, and play various tricks and conspiracies to resist the great proletarian cultural revolution. We must thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against the evil deeds of this handful of people. We must not be naive and romantic, must not be full of bookishness, and must not use the views of mediocre people to deal with the cruel class struggle.

The enemy's frenzy only shows their weakness. They try to save their failure with desperate struggles, which will only make their failure more miserable and their doom faster. A handful of reactionaries try to block the rolling wheels of history with their tiny arms, but in the end, they will be crushed to pieces. History will inevitably prove: They are nothing but autumn locusts and rabbit tails, and they won't last long!

Isn't the event in Wuhan exactly like this? Under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, the powerful political offensive of the proletariat, like a strong east wind of level twelve, swept away the dark clouds over the city of Wuhan and defeated the handful of arrogant and overbearing reactionaries who were once flying high, making them suffer a crushing defeat. It can be asserted that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in other places, as well as the stubborn reactionaries who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, will meet the same fate and inevitably so.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns. In the cause of socialism, if one wants to avoid twists and turns and not pay great efforts, always to have smooth sailing and easily achieve success, such a idea is merely a fantasy."

In the course of struggle, in a certain local area, or in a certain short period, reactionary forces may be rampant for a time, bringing certain losses to the revolution. However, no matter how difficult and arduous the situation, we must firmly believe that we hold the banner of truth of Mao Zedong Thought, the masses are on our side. As long as we have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, are not afraid of difficulties, and advance bravely, then the final victory will definitely be ours! A handful of reactionaries are nothing but giants with feet of clay. They have neither truth nor masses and can only rely on stealing and begging to make a living by instigating armed struggles and spreading rumors. Once the masses see through their counter-revolutionary faces, they will be left alone, shivering, and become rats that everyone wants to beat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The isolation of the enemy does not mean our victory. If we make policy mistakes, we still cannot achieve victory." The revolutionary faction of the proletariat must not only dare to struggle, stand up to any storm and stress, and be the backbone and iron men of the revolution; they must also be good at struggling and thinking, maintaining a clear political head in any situation, strictly grasping the Party's policies and strategies, and doing meticulous political and ideological work among the masses. We must act according to Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principle on the great proletarian cultural revolution. We must firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in various regions, concentrate our forces to give them a heavy blow, and overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Only in this way can we achieve a thorough victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

We must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching that the proletariat can only liberate all mankind and finally liberate itself, and correctly treat the deceived masses. We must see that the vast majority of them are our class brothers. We must help them awaken with deep class feelings, educate them with the Party's correct policies and our model actions, win them over, and guide them. Once the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the hearts of the deceived masses, the wall of deception built by the enemies of the proletariat on sand and thin ice will collapse, and the deceived masses will turn around and join the revolutionary faction of the proletariat to overthrow our common enemy.

The attitude of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat towards the deceived masses is also applicable to those cadres who have made mistakes but are still willing to correct them. Even for those cadres who have made serious mistakes, as long as they no longer insist on their mistakes, correct them seriously, and are forgiven by the broad revolutionary masses, they can still stand up and join the revolutionary ranks. In the past, a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, who are taking the capitalist road, used deception, threats, and other means to make some cadres take the wrong road through "collective appearance" and "signed appearance." These comrades, as long as they correct their mistakes as soon as they realize them, are still recognizing the problem; if they insist on not correcting, they will sink deeper and deeper and be haunted by the "ghost." In this way, it is no longer a matter of recognizing the problem, but a matter of stance, and even a more serious problem.

The revolution is closer to Beijing, and the rebellion feels Chairman Mao's closeness.

The revolutionary faction of the proletariat, in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, has experienced and continues to experience arduous struggles. In this struggle, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in every region and every unit is not isolated. Every struggle of ours is a component of the great struggle of the great proletarian cultural revolution throughout the country. Chairman Mao and the Central Committee firmly support us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat throughout the country firmly supports us, and the great People's Liberation Army firmly supports us. The enemies of the proletariat are struggling and shouting crazily, heading towards the grave day by day. The ranks of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat are advancing towards the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, breaking the waves and forging ahead bravely!

Victory belongs to the revolutionary faction of the proletariat!

    胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派
    任立新
    具有世界历史意义的无产阶级文化大革命，正在进入大批判、大斗争的决战阶段。规模空前广泛、内容极其深刻的革命的大批判的群众运动，正把我国无产阶级文化大革命推向一个更新的高潮。
    一年来，亿万革命群众发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏革命精神，揭露和打倒了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们在各地区、各部门的代理人。革命人民以无产阶级的大智大勇，摧毁了资产阶级一个又一个的反动顽固堡垒，荡涤着代表旧势力的污泥浊水。无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好。
    无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，使一小撮阶级敌人陷入了彻底灭亡的绝境。但是，正如毛主席所说：“这些人中的最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的”，“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。”
    前些时候，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，操纵和勾结“百万雄师”、“公检法”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，发动了猖狂进攻。他们不顾一切，赤膊上阵，想要在这块土地上刮起一股小台风。他们的目的，就是要以种种努力去恢复和维护资产阶级的旧势力、旧秩序，妄图在武汉地区实行资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    从武汉发生的事情，我们看到了一些具有普遍意义的问题：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派总是不甘心他们的失败，他们总是伺机向革命力量进行反扑。并且，他们的疯狂正是由于他们的失败而增强百倍。他们利用各种方法，寻找种种借口，操纵象武汉地区“百万雄师”和“公检法”那样的组织中一小撮坏头头，挑起武斗，大搞打、砸、抢、抄、抓，围剿无产阶级革命派，袭击革命群众组织，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级专政下的大民主，破坏社会主义生产，破坏革命的大批判、大斗争。他们还制造谣言，蒙蔽一部分群众，玩弄各种阴谋诡计，对抗无产阶级文化大革命。对于这一小撮人的罪恶行径，我们必须彻底揭露和坚决斗争，切不可天真烂漫，切不可书生气十足，切不可用庸人的观点来对待严酷的阶级斗争。
    敌人的疯狂，只能说明它的虚弱。他们妄图用绝命的挣扎来挽救自己的失败，只会使自己失败得更惨，完蛋得更快。一小撮反动家伙想用细小的螳臂挡住滚滚前进的历史车轮，最后，只能被辗得粉碎。历史必将无情地证明：他们只不过是秋后的蚂蚱，兔子的尾巴，长不了啦！
    武汉发生的事件难道不正是如此吗？在毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，无产阶级的强大政治攻势，犹如十二级强劲的东风，横扫了江城上空的乌云，把当初那一小撮飞扬跋扈、不可一世的反动家伙打个落花流水，一败涂地。可以断言，其它一些地方正在起劲地表演的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏家伙，他们的下场也只能是如此，必然是如此。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大的努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    在斗争的道路上，在某一个局部的地方，在某一段短暂的时间内，反动势力可能嚣张一时，给革命带来某些损失。但是，无论在怎样艰难困苦的场合，我们都应当坚定不移地相信，我们手中握有毛泽东思想的真理之旗，群众在我们一边，只要我们有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，最后的胜利一定是属于我们的！一小撮反动派只是一些泥足巨人，他们既无真理，又无群众，只能靠鼠窃狗偷，乞援于挑起武斗和制造谣言混日子。当群众一旦认清了他们的反革命面目，他们就会落到“茕茕孑立，形形相吊”的地步，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”无产阶级革命派不仅要敢于斗争，顶得住任何险风恶浪，做革命的硬骨头和钢铁汉；而且要善于斗争，善于思考，在任何情况下都要保持清醒的政治头脑，严格地掌握党的政策和策略，深入细致地去做群众的政治思想工作。我们一定要根据毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，指导我们的行动。紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头直指党内、军内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在各地区的代理人，集中力量狠狠地打击他们，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批臭。只有这样，我们才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    我们要按照毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的伟大教导，正确地对待受蒙蔽的群众。应当看到，他们绝大多数是我们的阶级弟兄。我们要满怀深厚的阶级感情去帮助他们醒悟过来，以党的正确政策和我们的模范行动去教育他们，争取他们，引导他们。毛泽东思想的阳光一旦照亮了受蒙蔽群众的心坎，无产阶级的敌人建筑在沙滩和薄冰上的欺骗之墙就会倒坍，受蒙蔽群众就会扭转方向，反戈一击，和无产阶级革命派一道，把我们共同的敌人打倒。
    无产阶级革命派对待受蒙蔽的群众的态度，同样也适用于对待那些犯了错误，但还是愿意改正的干部。即使是对于犯了严重错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大革命群众所谅解了之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。过去，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利用诱骗、威胁等手段，在干部中搞什么“集体亮相”、“签名亮相”，把一部分干部引上了错误的道路。这些同志只要知错即改，毕竟还是认识问题；如果坚持不改，就会越陷越深，就会被“鬼”缠住。这样，就不只是认识问题，而是立场问题，甚至是更严重的问题了。
    革命更知北京近，造反倍觉主席亲。
    无产阶级革命派为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，经历了并继续经历着艰苦卓绝的斗争。在这场斗争中，每一个地区，每一个单位的无产阶级革命派都决不是孤立的。我们的每一个斗争，都是全国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中的一个组成部分。毛主席、党中央坚决支持我们，全国无产阶级革命派坚决支持我们，伟大的人民解放军坚决支持我们。无产阶级的敌人正在疯狂的挣扎和叫嚣中一天天走向坟墓。无产阶级革命派的队伍正朝着毛主席所指引的航向，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
    胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派！
