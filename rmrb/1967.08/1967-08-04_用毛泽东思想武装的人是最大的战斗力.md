Those Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Are the Greatest Combat Force

Sergeant Major of the "Sea Tiger Boat," First-Class Hero Wang Muchang

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people and not things that are decisive." In "Long Live the Victory of People's War," Vice Chairman Lin Biao has made a very important exposition of Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking. He emphasizes: "The people's army must indeed attach importance to continuously improving weapons and equipment and raising military technology, but the people's army fights not simply by relying on weapons and technology, but more importantly by relying on politics, on the revolutionary consciousness and bravery of the cadres and fighters, and on the support and backing of the masses." The practice of the Chinese revolutionary war fully proves that this is an unshakable truth.

The 40-year combat history of our army since its founding is a history of defeating the enemy with inferior equipment. It is a history of achieving victory in war by arming every soldier with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, relying on people's consciousness, bravery, and spirit of sacrifice. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and it will continue to be like this in the future. The role of the human factor, the political factor, is not diminished but is more important in modern warfare. Modernized weapons and equipment play a major role in winning the war, but they cannot ultimately solve the problem. The more modernized the weapons are, the more they rely on people to master them, the more they rely on people's bravery and fearlessness to win battles. To win battles, it is not just a matter of technology, but first and foremost a matter of people's political consciousness. Seventeen years ago, in the battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands, our navy's many ships created the glorious example of defeating the enemy's large warships with small wooden boats.

In that battle, we formed a combat unit with several dozen tons and several hundred tons of modified small boats to engage the enemy fleet, which had several thousand-ton warships. In terms of ship tonnage, speed, and firepower, the enemy had a significant advantage. However, our cadres and fighters, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, had a loyal heart to fight for the liberation of the people of Wanshan, fully displaying the tactics of close combat and night fighting. The "Sea Pioneer Boat" and other brother boats charged into the enemy fleet, throwing grenades fiercely, and as soon as they approached the enemy ship, they jumped onto the enemy ship with bayonets, capturing prisoners, and fighting until the enemy was disoriented and howling in defeat. Finally, we annihilated 800 enemy troops, sank, damaged, and captured various enemy ships and boats totaling 20, and liberated the Wanshan Islands.

In 1965, in the naval battle east of Chongwu, our "Sea Tiger Boat" and brother ships together sank the enemy ship "Yongchang," which had a tonnage seven times ours, also because we displayed our army's daring fighting spirit of engaging in close combat at sea. When the enemy ship, relying on its firepower advantage, opened fire on our boat from four to five kilometers away, we did not pay any attention to it and continued to advance at high speed, like an arrow straight to the enemy's nose, grabbing it and pounding it fiercely. At this time, the enemy ship was dumbfounded, and all its long-range firepower advantages were useless, becoming mute and quietly taking the beating until it was hit by our shells and sank to the bottom of the sea.

Fighting with politics is fighting with Mao Zedong Thought. People's bravery and fearlessness, the hard skills of daring to engage in close combat, all come from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory in our battles is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought; those who are brave and fearless are those who study Chairman Mao's works best and use them most actively in peacetime. In the naval battle east of Chongwu, outstanding ammunition handlers Lin Changxin and Cai Wenji, famous gunner and ammunition handler Xiao Laohu Ge Yi, radio operator Yu Shijin and Qiu Xueyi, who sent out 141 messages without any errors, and communication soldier Yang Jinxing, who endured the pain of electric current stimulating the nerves and persisted until the battle was won, are all good soldiers who actively study and apply the "Three Articles" in peacetime. The victory in the naval battle east of Chongwu fully proves Vice Chairman Lin Biao's wise judgment: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat force is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless."

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, who acts as his agent in the military, Luo Ruiqing, vigorously opposes highlighting proletarian politics, opposes the army studying Chairman Mao's works, and advocates military technology first, engaging in "big competitions." His plot is to strip our army of its soul—Mao Zedong Thought—to achieve his evil goal of highlighting bourgeois politics, seizing the army, and restoring capitalism. This is a pipe dream and a waste of effort!

We must always carry out Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions: never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to highlight politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly smash all the plots and tricks of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

### 用毛泽东思想武装的人是最大的战斗力

专栏：

    在庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十周年的时候，解放军的一部分英雄、模范和先进单位的代表，结合自己在战斗中的亲身经历和当前国内外斗争形势，重新学习了毛主席关于人民战争的语录和林彪副主席的文章《人民战争胜利万岁》。这里发表的是他们的学习体会。　——编　者
    用毛泽东思想武装的人是最大的战斗力
    “海上猛虎艇”军士长　一等功巨　王木昌
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”林彪副主席在《人民战争胜利万岁》中，对毛主席的这一伟大战略思想，作了非常重要的论述。他强调指出：“人民军队固然也要重视不断改进武器装备和提高军事技术，但是，人民军队打仗不是单纯地凭武器、技术，而更重要的是凭政治，凭指战员的无产阶级革命觉悟和勇敢精神，凭人民群众的拥护和支持。”中国革命战争的实践充分证明，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    我军建军以来四十年的战斗历史，就是以劣势装备战胜优势装备之敌的历史，就是依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装每个战士的头脑，依靠人的觉悟、勇敢和牺牲精神而取得战争胜利的历史。过去是这样，现在是这样，将来仍然是这样。人的因素，政治因素的作用，在现代化战争中不是降低，而是更加重要了。现代化的武器装备，对战争的胜利有重大作用，但不能最后解决问题。武器越是现代化，越要靠人去掌握，越要靠人的勇敢、不怕死，才能打胜仗。要打胜仗，不单纯是技术问题，而首先是人的政治觉悟问题。十七年前，在解放万山群岛的战斗中，我们海军的许多舰艇，就首创了用小木船打败敌人大兵舰的光辉战例。
    在那次战斗中，我们用改装的几十吨、几百吨的小艇组成作战部队，同有几千吨大军舰的敌人舰队交锋。论舰艇的吨位、速度、火力，敌人都占很大的优势。但是，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的指战员，有一颗为解放万山人民而战的赤胆忠心，充分发挥了近战夜战的战术。“海上先锋艇”和其他兄弟艇一道杀进敌舰群，用手榴弹猛打，一靠上敌舰，就端起刺刀跳上敌舰，捕捉俘虏，直打得敌人晕头转向，鬼哭狼嚎。终于歼敌八百人，击沉、击伤、俘获各种敌舰艇二十艘，解放了万山群岛。
    一九六五年，在崇武以东海战中，我们“海上猛虎艇”和兄弟舰艇一起击沉吨位七倍于我的敌舰“永昌号”，也是由于发扬了我军敢于海上刺刀见红的战斗作风。当敌舰依仗它的火力优势，在四、五千米以外向我艇首先开炮的时候，我们根本不理它，一个劲地用高速度前进，象一支飞箭一样直插到敌人鼻子底下，揪住它猛捶狠打。这时候，敌舰傻了眼，一切远程火力优势都失灵了，成了哑吧，乖乖地呆在那里挨揍，一直到吃够了我们的炮弹，沉没海底。
    凭政治打仗，就是凭毛泽东思想打仗。人的勇敢、不怕死的精神，敢于刺刀见红的过硬功夫，都来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们每一次战斗的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利；凡是勇敢、不怕死的人，都是平时学习毛主席著作学得最好、用得最活的人。崇武以东海战中，出色的运弹手林长新、蔡文基，有名的炮手兼运弹手小老虎葛毅，收发一百四十一份电报没出一点差错的报务兵于时刚、仇学礼，在四十度高温的机舱里连续苦战十几小时的林立湖，忍受着电流刺激神经的痛苦，坚持到战斗胜利的通信兵杨进兴，都是平时活学活用“老三篇”的好战士。崇武以东海战的胜利，完全证明了林彪副主席的英明论断：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在军内的代理人罗瑞卿，极力反对突出无产阶级政治，反对部队学习毛主席著作，大肆鼓吹军事技术第一，大搞“大比武”，他的阴谋就是要抽掉我军的灵魂——毛泽东思想，以便达到他突出资产阶级的政治、篡军反党、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。这是白日作梦，枉费心机！
    我们要永远执行林彪副主席的指示：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切阴谋诡计。
