In early July, the liberation armed forces in the South of Vietnam, in the Hai Yun Ridge section of the First Highway, fought a very brilliant ambush battle. In this heroic battle, the liberation armed forces destroyed seventy enemy military vehicles, annihilated 340 American and puppet soldiers, and dealt another heavy blow to the American Marine Corps, which had suffered consecutive defeats south of the demilitarized zone.

The First Highway from Da Nang to Quang Tri is the main supply line for the American Marine Corps. Every day, many convoys of American and puppet military vehicles carrying troops, ammunition, and supplies travel from Da Nang to Quang Tri.

Fighting Spirits High, Ready for Battle

Hai Yun Ridge is the most treacherous section of this highway. On the morning of July 3, as soon as the sun rose, the liberation armed forces had already set up their ambush positions in the Fu Lu area. Land mines were buried, various types of guns and cannons were aimed at the road, and the soldiers, cleverly camouflaged, were all ready for battle, awaiting the order to attack.

Originally, only one platoon of puppet soldiers was responsible for patrolling this section of the road. Today, suddenly, another platoon was added. The soldiers accurately judged that there would be an important enemy convoy passing through. These two platoons of patrolling puppet soldiers, fearing an attack by the liberation armed forces, fired randomly at both sides of the road before hiding in a village.

Striking Fear into the Enemy's Heart

Around 10 o'clock, the observation post reported that an enemy convoy of fifty-two military vehicles, carrying two companies of puppet soldiers and a large amount of weapons, was approaching. The soldiers immediately prepared, calmly waiting for one enemy vehicle after another to enter the ambush zone. Upon the command, the soldiers unleashed a fierce barrage of fire at the enemy convoy. Soldier A Qing's anti-tank gun hit the leading jeep with its first shot, instantly killing the four American aggressors on it. The enemy's vehicles, jammed together, were hit and set on fire. The enemy soldiers jumped out of the vehicles and fled. The soldiers on the high ground on both sides of the road immediately sealed off their escape routes with heavy machine gun fire, shooting the enemy in all directions, causing them to panic and scatter. Taking advantage of the enemy's chaos, the soldiers immediately jumped out of their positions, charging into the enemy ranks, using grenades and hand grenades to destroy enemy vehicles and annihilate the enemy. Some vehicles at the rear of the enemy convoy quickly turned around to flee, but were blocked by soldiers who had been lying in wait, and were all destroyed.

Pursuing the Victory, Annihilating the Americans

Behind the puppet soldiers' convoy, there was another convoy of American aggressors. Upon hearing that the puppet soldiers' convoy leading the way had been ambushed, they did not care about the fate of the puppet soldiers and immediately turned around in panic to flee. The soldiers of the liberation armed forces quickly pursued, destroying twelve enemy vehicles and killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

To support this ambush battle, the artillery of the liberation armed forces fiercely bombarded the enemy in the Fu Jia stronghold. The first barrage of shells destroyed the enemy's artillery positions and hit the enemy's fuel depot. The enemy in this stronghold was in a state of panic and dared not send reinforcements. The enemy in the Fu Lu county city, upon receiving the distress signal from the puppet soldiers' convoy, immediately dispatched many enemy vehicles, protected by many armored vehicles, to reinforce. However, they had not gone far before they were blocked by the destroyed bridge and could not pass. The soldiers of the liberation armed forces, who had been lying in wait near the bridge, immediately launched a fierce attack, destroying many more enemy vehicles and finally driving the enemy back in disarray to the county city.

In the battle of Hai Yun Ridge, the liberation armed forces fully demonstrated the spirit of the people's army, which is clever, flexible, and fierce in attack. The enemy was routed. After this battle, every time the enemy convoy passed through Hai Yun Ridge, they were terrified, fearing another ambush by the liberation armed forces. However, in the battlefields of South Vietnam, there are Hai Yun Ridges everywhere. The American aggressors will surely suffer even heavier blows and more miserable defeats.

### 海云岭上漂亮的伏击战

    海云岭上漂亮的伏击战
    七月初，越南南方承天省解放武装力量在第一号公路上的海云岭，打了一场十分漂亮的伏击战。在这一英勇的战斗中，解放武装力量一举击毁敌人军车七十辆，歼灭美伪军三百四十人，给予在非军事区以南连吃败仗的美国海军陆战队又一个沉重的打击。
    从岘港到广治的一号公路，是美国海军陆战队的主要补给线。在这条公路上，每天都有许多运送军队、弹药和物资的美伪军车队从岘港开来，驶往广治。
    斗志昂扬  严阵以待
    海云岭是这条公路上最险要的一个地段。七月三日早晨，太阳刚刚升起，解放武装力量就已经在富禄地区布置好了伏击阵地。地雷埋好了，各种不同口径的枪炮对准了路面，伪装得极为巧妙的战士们个个斗志昂扬，待令出击。
    在这段路上，原来只有伪军一个排担任巡逻任务，今天忽然又增加了一个排。战士们准确地判断：今天会有重要的敌人车队通过。这两个排巡逻的伪军害怕解放武装力量的袭击，向公路两旁胡乱扫射了一阵后，就躲进一个村子里去了。
    杀入敌阵使敌丧胆
    十时左右，观察哨报告：敌人的一支由五十二辆军车组成的、装载着两连伪军和大量武器的车队开过来了。战士们立即作好准备，沉着地等待一辆又一辆敌人的军车进入了伏击圈。一声令下，战士们猛烈的火力就准确地射向了敌人的车队。战士阿清的反坦克炮第一炮就击中了带头的一辆吉普车，车上的四名美国侵略者也当场报销了。堵塞在一起的敌人的一辆辆军车被击中起火了，车上的敌人纷纷跳车逃命。公路两旁高地上的战士们立即用重机枪的火力封住了他们的逃路，打得敌人东奔西窜，慌成一团。乘敌人一片混乱的时候，战士们立刻跳出阵地，冲杀到敌阵中去，用手雷和手榴弹击毁敌车，消灭敌人。在敌人车队后面的一些车辆急忙掉头逃命，但是被早已埋伏好的战士们堵住了退路，最后都被击毁了。
    乘胜追击  痛歼美军
    在伪军的车队后面，还有美国侵略军的一个车队。他们听到给他们打头阵的伪军车队遭到伏击后，也顾不得伪军的死活，马上慌慌张张掉过头来逃命。解放武装力量战士们立刻快速追击，击毁了敌人十二辆军车，打死打伤了很多敌人。
    为了配合这一伏击战，解放武装力量的炮兵猛烈轰击了富嘉据点里的敌人，头一阵炮弹就击毁了敌人的炮兵阵地和击中了敌人的汽油库。这个据点里的敌人慌成一团，根本不敢派兵出来增援。驻在富禄县城里的敌人接到伪军车队的求救信号后急忙派出许多辆车的敌军在很多装甲车的保护下前来增援，但是他们刚走出不远，就由于桥梁被破坏而通不过去了。埋伏在桥梁附近的解放武装力量的战士们立刻发起了猛烈的攻击，又击毁了敌人许多辆军车，最后把这支敌军打得狼狈逃回到县城里去了。
    解放武装力量在海云岭战斗中高度发挥了人民军队机智灵活、猛冲猛打的精神，打得敌人狼狈不堪。在这次战斗以后敌人车队每次通过海云岭的时候都是心惊胆战，害怕再次遭到解放武装力量的伏击。但是，在南越战场上，到处都是海云岭，美国侵略军必将遭到更沉重的打击和更悲惨的失败。
