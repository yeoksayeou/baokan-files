The Soviet revisionist leadership has consistently whitewashed the dictatorial, traitorous, anti-communist, and anti-people Myanma reactionary government, lavishly praising the Ne Win reactionary clique's fake socialist goods.

The Ne Win reactionary military junta, representing the interests of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, has since 1962 taken power and intensified fascist dictatorship, crazily opposed communism and the people, and carried out bloody massacres. The Soviet revisionists have shamelessly cheered for the reactionary policies and heinous crimes of the Ne Win clique. The Soviet Union's *Red Star* newspaper on March 27, 1965, openly praised the butcher Ne Win, who rose to power through the suppression and massacre of the Myanmar people, as having undergone a "revolution," claiming that the Ne Win military clique "maintains contact with the people and is faithful to the interests of the people."

The Soviet revisionists also boast that the Ne Win reactionary clique is moving towards "socialism." The Soviet magazine *World Economy and International Relations* in its first issue this year spread the lie that Myanmar is "beginning to transition to socialism" without a Marxist-Leninist party in its leadership. It also claimed that although Myanmar "lacks direct proletarian leadership," it can advance towards socialism under the leadership of "revolutionary democrats" supported by the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists treat the so-called "socialist program" used by the Ne Win reactionary clique to deceive the Myanmar people as a treasure, operating their propaganda machinery to praise it, acting as the first cheerleader for Ne Win's "socialist program." *New Times* and *Pravda* as early as the beginning of 1963 shouted that Ne Win's "socialist program" "opens up a realistic prospect for rapid economic development in Myanmar," and that Ne Win's "socialist road" "is completely achievable." On September 26, 1965, after Brezhnev and Kosygin of the Soviet revisionist leadership met with Ne Win, the *Soviet-Myanmar Joint Statement* openly declared that the "Soviet side pointed out the broad progressive nature of the program for 'Myanmar's path to socialism.'" On September 21, 1965, Brezhnev of the Soviet revisionist leadership, with a broad smile, flattered and fawned over Ne Win, congratulating him on his further achievements in leading "New Myanmar" along the socialist path. At the same time, TASS issued a commentary saying, "The new leadership of Myanmar is implementing the program of the 'Myanmar socialist road' with practical actions." The *Red Star* newspaper on March 27, 1966, boasted that Ne Win's so-called "socialist program" is to "eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man, establish an economy based on socialist foundations, and build a new democratic society," and so on. The Soviet revisionist clique also regarded the so-called "Myanmar Socialist Program Party" as a fraternal party. In 1963, when the Soviet revisionist leader Ponamarev met with the head of the "Myanmar Socialist Program Party," Colonel Su Min, he affectionately called Su Min "comrade."

The Soviet revisionist clique also extolled the so-called "achievements" of the Ne Win clique. In a telegram on January 3 this year, the Soviet revisionist leader Podgorny flatteringly praised the reactionary government of Myanmar for its "social and economic transformation" and the "achievements on this path." The *Red Star* newspaper on March 27, 1965, also fabricated that the reactionary policies of the Ne Win government have enabled "Myanmar farmers to shake off feudal oppression," "greatly strengthened Myanmar's revolutionary position," and "placed Myanmar at the forefront of those Asian and African young countries that have taken the non-capitalist development path."

The Soviet revisionists' support and praise for the Myanmar reactionaries have made the Ne Win clique overjoyed.

Like attracts like, birds of a feather flock together. The Soviet revisionist leadership harbors deep hatred for the Myanmar people and the Myanmar Communist Party, which is bravely fighting against imperialism and domestic reactionaries. However, towards the Ne Win fascist gang, they are as close as family. This is not surprising. But now, the Ne Win reactionary government, which is carrying out dictatorship, treason, anti-communism, and anti-people under the banner of "socialism," is facing its grave. The Soviet revisionist clique, which is betraying the Soviet people and the people of the world under the banner of "communism," will also not have a good ending.

### 物以类聚　人以群分  苏修领导集团为奈温假社会主义叫好

    物以类聚　人以群分
    苏修领导集团为奈温假社会主义叫好
    据新华社讯　苏修领导集团一贯为独裁、卖国、反共、反人民的缅甸反动政府涂脂抹粉，大肆吹捧奈温反动集团的假社会主义黑货。
    代表地主阶级和官僚资产阶级利益的奈温反动军阀集团在一九六二年上台后，加紧实行法西斯独裁统治，疯狂反共反人民，进行血腥大屠杀。苏修竟丧心病狂地为奈温集团的反动政策和滔天罪行喝采叫好。苏联《红星报》一九六五年三月二十七日，公然把靠镇压和屠杀缅甸人民起家的刽子手奈温的上台，吹捧为是一次“革命”，说什么奈温军人集团“保持着同人民的联系，忠实于人民的利益”。
    苏修并胡吹奈温反动集团在走向“社会主义”。苏联《世界经济和国际关系》杂志今年第一期，散布什么缅甸在“国家领导中没有马克思列宁主义政党的情况下”，也在“开始向社会主义过渡”；又说什么，缅甸虽然“缺乏直接的无产阶级领导”，但在得到苏修支持的“革命民主活动家的领导下，是能够向社会主义推进的”等等。
    苏修对奈温反动集团用以招摇撞骗，欺骗缅甸人民的所谓“社会主义纲领”，更是奉为至宝，开动宣传机器大加赞扬，充当奈温的“社会主义纲领”的第一号吹鼓手。《新时代》和《真理报》早在一九六三年初便叫嚷，奈温的“社会主义纲领”“在缅甸面前开辟了迅速发展经济的现实前景”，奈温的
  “社会主义道路”“是完全能够办得到的”。一九六五年九月二十六日，苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金同奈温会谈后发表的《苏缅联合公报》中公然宣称，“苏联方面指出‘缅甸通向社会主义之路’的纲领的广泛的进步的性质”。一九六五年九月二十一日，苏修头目勃列日涅夫在接见奈温时，眉开眼笑地吹拍逢迎，祝贺奈温在领导“新缅甸沿着社会主义道路发展中取得进一步的成就”。与此同时，塔斯社发表评论说，“缅甸新的领导人用实际行动实行‘缅甸的社会主义道路’的纲领”。《红星报》一九六六年三月二十七日把奈温的所谓“社会主义纲领”，胡吹为是“消灭人剥削人的现象，建立基于社会主义基础的经济，建成新的民主社会”等等。苏修叛徒集团还把所谓“缅甸社会主义纲领党”视为兄弟党，一九六三年苏修头目波诺马廖夫接见“缅甸社会主义纲领党”的头目苏敏上校时，就亲昵地称苏敏为“同志”。
    苏修叛徒集团还极力吹嘘奈温集团的所谓建设“成就”。苏修头目波德戈尔内今年一月三日给奈温的贺电中肉麻地夸奖缅甸反动政府“达到的社会经济改造”和“在这条道路上所取得的成绩”。《红星报》一九六五年三月二十七日还胡诌什么奈温政府的反动政策，使“缅甸农民正在摆脱封建压迫”，
  “大大地加强了缅甸的革命阵地”，“使缅甸在那些走上了非资本主义发展道路的亚非年轻国家中达到了领先地位”。
    苏修对缅甸反动派如此的支持和赞美，使奈温集团受宠若惊。
    物以类聚，人以群分。苏修领导集团对缅甸人民，对同帝国主义和国内反动派进行着英勇斗争的缅甸共产党，是刻骨仇恨；而对奈温法西斯匪帮，却亲如一家。这是毫不奇怪的。但是，现在打着“社会主义”招牌实行独裁、卖国、反共、反人民的奈温反动政府已经面临坟墓，而打着“共产主义”招牌出卖苏联人民和全世界人民利益的苏修叛徒集团，也决不会有好下场。
