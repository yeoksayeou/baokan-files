The Ne Win reactionary government is continuing to brutally persecute overseas Chinese in even more insidious and vicious ways. The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma are still living in dire straits.

Although the fully armed reactionary troops of Ne Win have withdrawn from the overseas Chinese residential areas in Rangoon, the number of spies sent to these areas has increased compared to before. Plainclothes spies are everywhere in the streets and alleys of the overseas Chinese residential areas. These spies not only monitor, follow, and restrict the movements of overseas Chinese but also harass and threaten them. At the same time, reactionary military police are arbitrarily searching and arresting patriotic overseas Chinese. Many patriotic overseas Chinese are often summoned for "interrogation" without reason. Some released overseas Chinese are thrown back into prison the next day.

The Ne Win clique is also intensifying its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek gang to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese. Some Chiang Kai-shek spies continue to return to Rangoon from Thailand to carry out assassinations and kidnappings of overseas Chinese.

In addition, the Ne Win reactionary government is using various underhanded methods to persecute the already desperate broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, attempting to completely cut off their livelihoods. In the anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese atrocities orchestrated and organized by the Ne Win reactionary government, many overseas Chinese families have been looted clean by mobs.

Some of these people try to use borrowed small amounts of capital to run small businesses like selling tea or food to make a living. However, the Ne Win reactionary government does not allocate resources to them. Even if overseas Chinese can open small shops with a small amount of goods, spies often go to threaten and extort money. Even more shamelessly, the Ne Win clique, on one hand, uses its newspapers to spread rumors that the food in overseas Chinese food shops is poisonous, and on the other hand, directs spies and thugs to put poison in the food bought from overseas Chinese-run food shops to frame and harm overseas Chinese. The Ne Win clique also uses various excuses to not allocate rice and cooking oil to overseas Chinese, making it impossible for many overseas Chinese to live. These facts further expose the evil intentions of the Ne Win reactionary government in trying to obstruct the Chinese government from sending relief supplies to the suffering overseas Chinese.

The situation of patriotic overseas Chinese in other regions of Burma is the same. Many overseas Chinese are arbitrarily arrested and interrogated, and their licenses are revoked. In some places, overseas Chinese are not allowed to leave their residences, and they are even forced to relocate collectively.

The Ne Win reactionary government brutally killed hundreds of overseas Chinese in various parts of Burma at the end of June, and the blood has not yet dried. Now, it is using even more insidious and shameful methods to persecute overseas Chinese. This can only further strengthen the resolve of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese to fight resolutely against the Ne Win reactionary government and can only further awaken the Burmese people, accelerating the downfall of the Ne Win reactionary regime.

### 奈温反动政府继续疯狂迫害华侨  密布特务监视跟踪  反动军警搜查逮捕

    奈温反动政府继续疯狂迫害华侨
    密布特务监视跟踪  反动军警搜查逮捕
    新华社十五日讯　仰光消息：奈温反动政府正以更阴险、更毒辣的方式继续迫害华侨。缅甸广大爱国华侨仍然处在水深火热之中。
    现在，虽然全副武装的奈温反动军队已经撤离仰光华侨居住区，但是派到华侨居住区的特务比过去增加了。便衣特务密布于华侨居住区的大街和小巷。这些特务不但监视、跟踪和限制华侨的行动，而且刁难和威胁他们。同时，反动军警肆意搜查和逮捕爱国华侨。许多爱国华侨常常被无理传去“讯问”。有些被捕华侨刚被释放，第二天又被投入监狱。
    奈温集团还正在加紧勾结蒋帮分子，迫害爱国华侨。一些蒋帮特务分子继续从泰国回到仰光，负责暗杀和绑架华侨的勾当。
    此外，奈温反动政府还以种种阴谋手段从生活上迫害已经濒于绝境的广大爱国华侨，企图根本上断绝他们的生计。在奈温反动政府这次一手策划和组织的反华排华暴行中，许多华侨家庭被暴徒洗劫一空。
    他们中有些人想用借来的微薄本钱经营一些象卖茶水、卖食品这样的小本生意，以便维持生计。但是，奈温反动政府却不给他们分配物资。即使华侨能够以少量的物资开起小铺，特务们则经常去进行恫吓和敲诈勒索。更无耻的是，奈温集团一面通过它的报纸，造谣说华侨食品店的食品有毒，一面指使特务和歹徒把毒品放进从华侨经营的食品店买来的食品里，对华侨进行诬告和陷害。奈温集团还以各种借口不给华侨分配大米和食油，使许多华侨无法生活下去。这些事实进一步暴露了奈温反动政府竭力阻挠中国政府运送救济品救济受难华侨的罪恶目的。
    缅甸其他地区爱国华侨的境遇也是一样。许多华侨无辜被捕、被盘问，登记执照被吊销。有的地方竟然不许华侨离开住地，甚至强迫他们集体迁移。
    奈温反动政府六月底在缅甸各地疯狂杀害了几百名华侨，血迹还没有干。现在，它又使用更加阴险、更加可耻的手段来迫害华侨。这只能进一步加强广大爱国华侨坚决同奈温反动政府斗争的意志，只能进一步唤起缅甸人民的觉醒，加速奈温反动政权的灭亡。
