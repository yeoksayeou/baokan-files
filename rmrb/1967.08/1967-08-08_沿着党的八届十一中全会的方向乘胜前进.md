Millions of soldiers and civilians, filled with revolutionary fervor, review the victorious battles of the past year and march forward along the direction of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

The great Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee further established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, designated Comrade Lin Biao, who consistently holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and is the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in defending and executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as the deputy helmsman of the entire Party. It further consolidated the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We must continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and fight to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on August 7, in the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the midst of a nationwide struggle and criticism against the Party's top anti-revolutionary clique that takes the capitalist road, a new revolutionary upsurge has arisen to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country, filled with revolutionary fighting spirit, enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. They review the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, and cannot help but shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They resolutely declare: We must unswervingly follow the direction of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the great revolutionary program of the "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, continue to advance victoriously, and resolutely smash the top anti-revolutionary clique within the Party that takes the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to build new achievements in the great historical task of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters!

After the editorial "Thoroughly Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters" was published by the Red Flag magazine to commemorate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, there was a wave of excitement across the country. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who firmly support the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, Wuhan, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Chengdu, Nanchang, and Changsha held mass meetings, symposiums, and posted big-character posters to enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, which is of great historical significance to our Party and country and to the international communist movement.

More than 500 representatives attending the Beijing Garrison Area Active Participants in Studying Chairman Mao's Works Conference enthusiastically sang the praises of the earth-shaking changes over the past year, the great achievements of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line through their personal experiences. The representatives pointed out in their speeches: The convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee a year ago and Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" are events of great historical significance. They exposed the long-existing struggle between the two lines and the two headquarters within the Party and pointed out the main direction of the Cultural Revolution to the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's big-character poster is the order to march and the call to arms to smash the bourgeois headquarters. We must follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, carry out the great criticism, aim directly at the bourgeois headquarters, and give it the most thorough and fatal blow to smash it completely.

Revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Railway Joint Command said: During the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and personally drafted the "Sixteen Articles." These are great historical documents of epoch-making significance, worthy of being recorded in the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement. These important documents have solemnly sentenced the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev to death, declared the bankruptcy of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by China's Khrushchev, greatly suppressed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, greatly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, greatly upheld the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat! It is under the guidance of these great documents that we, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, fear neither heaven nor earth, and charge and fight against the bourgeois headquarters, achieving today's brilliant victory! The editorial "Thoroughly Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters" by the Red Flag magazine completely expresses our feelings. We must study it seriously, understand it deeply, and carry it out resolutely.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Wuhan, who have been fighting bravely against the small clique within the Party and the military that takes the capitalist road in the Wuhan region and their ultimate backer, China's Khrushchev, deeply feel the epoch-making and great historical significance of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee through their year-long fighting practice. They said, the great Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee further established the absolute authority of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party and the country, designated Comrade Lin Biao, who consistently holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and is the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as the deputy helmsman of the entire Party, and further consolidated the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness for us, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world. It is precisely the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, personally convened by Chairman Mao, that defeated the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, inspired and armed hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to bombard the bourgeois headquarters with ten thousand cannons, winning victory after victory and achieving great victories. They resolutely declare to continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and fight to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards in various places, while celebrating their victories, firmly declare that they will unswervingly follow the revolutionary line of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the "August 7th Commune" in Henan, the "Changsha Workers' Federation," and the "Xiangjiang Thunder" in Hunan, filled with revolutionary fervor, reviewed their year-long fighting journey and said, when the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev was frantically pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and implementing white terror, persecuting the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, we revolutionary cadres did not change our faces or hearts. We firmly believed that the great leader Chairman Mao supported us, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao backed us up. We firmly believed that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line would be victorious. The more difficulties we faced, the more we studied Chairman Mao's works and the great "Sixteen Articles," the clearer our minds became, and the more resolute our fighting spirit was. Chairman Mao backs us up, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We will not rest until we thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters! The warriors of the "August 18th Revolutionary Rebel Corps" in Hohhot said at a symposium: The year-long struggle has gone through many twists and turns, but we have been able to grasp the general direction of the struggle because Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Articles" pointed out the direction and target of the struggle for us. We must follow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, seize the bourgeois headquarters, and charge and fight. The warriors of the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Proletarian Revolutionary Cadres in Jiangxi Province recently, in the high tide of great struggle and great criticism, strove to study and understand the theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies of the Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and enhancing the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in the struggle.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places, reviewing the great victories of the past year, further inspired their revolutionary fighting spirit and courage. They unanimously declared: At present, although the bourgeois headquarters has been defeated, the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines has not ended. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, better study the "Sixteen Articles," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, march forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's big-character poster, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen dog, launch a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize China's Khrushchev deeply and thoroughly, fight him down and stink him up, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the past few days, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, while celebrating the first anniversary of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, have enthusiastically reread Chairman Mao's brilliant documents such as "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Articles." Many soldiers and officers held denunciation meetings, criticism meetings, and symposiums, exposing the heinous crimes of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, talking about the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, and criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, for their reactionary bourgeois military line. Soldiers and officers of the Air Force and Naval Aviation who made outstanding contributions to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution revealed in a criticism meeting, with a large amount of facts, the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, and resolutely declared that they would hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch more fierce attacks on the bourgeois headquarters, be the vanguard and the spearhead in the struggle, and resolutely criticize the small clique within the Party and the military that takes the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

The Mao Zedong Thought Art Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the PLA performed art programs praising the "Sixteen Articles" in rural areas, widely publicizing the great significance of the "Sixteen Articles."

    亿万军民满怀革命豪情回顾一年来胜利的战斗历程
    沿着党的八届十一中全会的方向乘胜前进
    伟大的八届十一中全会进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，确定了一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、最忠诚、最坚决、最彻底捍卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的林彪同志为全党的副统帅，进一步巩固了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。我们要继续发扬革命造反精神，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部而斗争。
    据新华社七日讯　在越来越好的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，在全国范围内对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大斗争、大批判，掀起彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的革命新高潮中，全国各地无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众、红卫兵小将和人民解放军指战员，怀着革命的战斗的豪情，热烈欢庆党的八届十一中全会召开一周年。他们回顾一年来无产阶级文化大革命所取得的震惊世界的伟大成就，情不自禁地千遍万遍欢呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们坚决表示：一定要坚定不移地沿着党的八届十一中全会的方向，在伟大领袖毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条的伟大革命纲领指引下，继续乘胜前进，坚决从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为胜利完成彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大历史任务建立新的功勋！
    《红旗》杂志为纪念党的八届十一中全会召开一周年而写的社论《彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部》发表以后，全国各地一片欢腾。北京、上海、黑龙江、山东、山西、贵州、武汉、青海、内蒙古、河南、成都、南昌、长沙等地无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和坚决支持无产阶级革命派的人民解放军指战员，纷纷举行群众大会、座谈会，出大字报，热烈庆祝关系我们党和国家命运、关系国际共产主义运动命运的具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会召开一周年。
    正在出席北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的五百多名代表，用亲身的经历，热情地歌颂了一年来翻天覆地的变化，歌颂了八届十一中全会的伟大成果，歌颂了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。代表们在发言中指出：一年前党的八届十一中全会的召开和毛主席写的《炮打司令部》的大字报，是具有伟大历史意义的事件，它揭开了党内长期存在的两条路线、两个司令部斗争的盖子，给无产阶级革命派指明了文化大革命的主攻方向。毛主席的大字报是摧毁资产阶级司令部的进军号和动员令。我们要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，搞好革命大批判，坚决对准资产阶级司令部，给予这个司令部最彻底、最致命的打击，把它彻底摧毁。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部铁路联合指挥部等单位的革命派战士说：毛主席在党的八届十一中全会期间，写了《炮打司令部》大字报，并亲自主持制定十六条。这是具有划时代意义的伟大历史文件，是中国革命史上和国际共产主义运动史上值得大书特书的不朽文献。这些重要文献，庄严宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的死刑，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的破产，大灭了资产阶级的威风，大树了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大立了毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气！我们无产阶级革命派就是在这些伟大文件的指引下，天不怕，地不怕，向资产阶级司令部猛冲猛打，取得了今天这样辉煌的胜利！《红旗》杂志社论《彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部》完全说出了我们的心里话。我们一定认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    满怀对阶级敌人的深仇大恨、一直同武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们的总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫进行英勇搏斗的武汉无产阶级革命派，从一年来的战斗实践中，深切体会到党的八届十一中全会具有划时代的伟大的历史意义。他们说，伟大的八届十一中全会进一步树立了光焰无际的毛泽东思想在全党、全国的绝对权威，确定了一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、最忠诚、最坚决、最彻底执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的林彪同志为全党的副统帅，进一步巩固了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，这是我们无产阶级革命派的最大幸福，是全世界革命人民的最大幸福。正是毛主席亲自主持召开的党的八届十一中全会，击败了以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，鼓舞和武装亿万革命群众万炮猛轰资产阶级司令部，打了一个又一个大胜仗，取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。他们坚决表示继续发扬革命造反精神，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部而斗争。
    各地广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将在欢庆胜利的时候，都坚定地表示，一定紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。河南“二七公社”，湖南“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等无产阶级革命派和革命小将，满怀革命豪情，回顾一年来的战斗历程时说，在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，实行白色恐怖，迫害无产阶级革命派的时候，我们革命派战士脸不变色心不跳，我们坚信伟大领袖毛主席支持我们，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部为我们撑腰，我们坚信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线必胜。越是困难，我们越是要学毛主席著作和伟大的十六条，越学心越明，斗志越坚定。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气，不把资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁，誓不罢休！呼和浩特“八·一八”革命造反团的战士们在座谈会上说：一年来的斗争，经过了许多曲折反复，我们所以能够始终掌握斗争大方向，就是因为毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报和十六条为我们指出了斗争方向和目标。我们就是要紧跟毛主席的无产阶级司令部，抓住资产阶级司令部不放，猛冲猛打。江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会的战士们，最近在大斗争、大批判的高潮中，努力学习和领会毛主席提出的文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，以毛泽东思想为武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，并在斗争中提高无产阶级革命派的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众回顾一年来的伟大胜利，更加鼓舞了革命的斗志和勇气，他们一致表示：当前，资产阶级司令部虽然已经被击败，但是两个司令部、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更好地学习十六条，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席的大字报所指引的方向，以痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫批深批透、斗倒斗臭，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    这几天，中国人民解放军广大指战员在庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的时候，都满怀革命激情地重温毛主席《炮打司令部》、十六条等光辉文献。许多部队指战员召开声讨会、批判会、座谈会，大揭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的滔天罪行，大谈一年来无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，大批中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军队的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的反动的资产阶级军事路线。为保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出突出贡献的空军和海军航空兵作战有功人员，在一次批判会上，以大量的事实，揭露了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军内代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流的罪恶之后，坚决表示，要更高地举起革命的批判旗帜，向资产阶级司令部发起更加猛烈的攻击，在斗争中当先锋，打头阵，坚决把党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，把资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁。（附图片）
