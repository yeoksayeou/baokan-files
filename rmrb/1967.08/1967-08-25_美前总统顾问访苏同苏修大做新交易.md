    Former U.S. President Kennedy’s advisor, Sorensen, recently visited the Soviet Union and left Moscow on the 22nd to return to his country.

    As soon as Sorensen arrived in Moscow, he expressed his “concern” about the current state of Sino-Soviet relations and wanted to hold “exploratory talks” with Soviet trade officials on “major and high-level policy changes.”

    According to reports, the Soviet revisionist leadership gave Sorensen a “grand reception” and dispatched the Minister and Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, as well as high-level officials from the Foreign Ministry and other departments, to hold multiple “talks” with him on issues such as Vietnam and Sino-Soviet relations. During the “talks,” Sorensen advocated for the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists to take further steps to develop Sino-Soviet relations. He said, “The market for American products here (in the Soviet Union) is indeed very large.” He revealed that the Soviet high-level officials “agreed” with his opinion on expanding Sino-Soviet trade at the present time. He also said that the “enthusiasm” shown by Soviet officials in the “talks” for remembering President Kennedy made him “surprised.” This once again blatantly exposed the Soviet revisionist clique’s betrayal of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, their constant currying favor with U.S. imperialism, and their willingness to be slaves of U.S. imperialism.

    美前总统顾问访苏同苏修大做新交易
    新华社二十四日讯　莫斯科消息：美国前总统肯尼迪的顾问索伦森，最近到苏联进行“访问”后，已在二十二日离开莫斯科回国。
    索伦森一到莫斯科就表示“很关切苏美关系的现状”，要同苏联贸易官员就“重大的高级的政策改变”举行“探讨性的会谈”。
    据报道，苏修领导集团给予了索伦森“隆重的接待”，并且先后派对外贸易部部长、副部长以及外交部等部门的高级官员，就越南问题和苏美关系等问题同他举行了多次“会谈”。索伦森在“会谈”中鼓吹苏修和美帝进一步“采取步骤”来发展苏美关系，“在这些步骤当中可以包括增加贸易”。他说，“美国产品在这里（苏联）的市场的确是很大的。”他透露，苏修高级官员“同意”他的在当前就“扩大”苏美贸易的“意见”。他还说，苏修官员们在“会谈”中表现出来的“怀念肯尼迪总统的热情”，使他“感到惊奇”。这又一次赤裸裸地暴露出苏修集团背叛越南人民和世界人民的利益，一味地讨好美帝和甘当美帝奴仆的丑恶面目。
