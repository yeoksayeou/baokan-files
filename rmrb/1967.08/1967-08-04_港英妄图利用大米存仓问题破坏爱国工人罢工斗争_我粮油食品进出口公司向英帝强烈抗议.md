	The Chinese Grain and Oil Food Import and Export Corporation today issued a statement strongly protesting the British Hong Kong authorities' attempt to use the rice storage issue to disrupt the normal supply of rice to Hong Kong, sabotage the great strike by patriotic workers in Hong Kong, and sabotage the struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against British oppression.

	The statement pointed out that recently, while brutally suppressing patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong authorities have also been obstructing and sabotaging the normal supply of daily necessities to the four million compatriots in Hong Kong. After illegally searching the foodstuffs trucks sent by our company through Man Kam To to Kowloon on July 18, the British Hong Kong authorities have recently been unreasonably harassing and obstructing the storage of our exported rice in Hong Kong warehouses. The statement pointed out that this is obviously a planned and premeditated provocation by the British Hong Kong authorities.

	The statement said that we firmly support the serious protest made by our Hong Kong agent, the Hua Chun Company, on July 28 regarding the British Hong Kong authorities' obstruction of the normal export of our rice to Hong Kong.

	The statement strongly condemns the British Hong Kong authorities' long-standing hostile attitude towards our supply of rice to Hong Kong, implementing restrictive and discriminatory reactionary policies. The statement said that recently, these reactionary policies have developed to a frenzied extent. Since June, in order to resolutely counter the British Hong Kong authorities' fascist atrocities against patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, patriotic workers in Hong Kong have launched a magnificent great strike. Our Hong Kong agent, the Hua Chun Company, in order to resolutely support this just struggle, decided not to store our rice in warehouses under the jurisdiction of striking workers. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of compatriots in Hong Kong for rice, after consulting with rice importers, we agreed to store the rice we supply to Hong Kong in warehouses that have been approved for rice storage and where striking workers agree to unload the cargo. This is entirely reasonable. However, the British Hong Kong authorities maliciously fabricated the lie that the Hua Chun Company "forced" rice importers to store our rice in the warehouses of the Swire Group and other four companies, and brazenly revoked the rice storage permits of the Swire Group and other four warehouses, and unreasonably canceled the stamps on the import permits of certain rice importers that read "can be stored in any approved warehouse." This is a major conspiracy by the British Hong Kong authorities.

	The statement solemnly warns the British Hong Kong authorities that your attempt to use the rice storage issue to sabotage the great strike by patriotic workers in Hong Kong is utterly impossible. You must immediately rescind the unreasonable decision to revoke the rice storage permits of the Swire Group and other four warehouses, and immediately stop all restrictive and discriminatory measures against our exported rice. If the British Hong Kong authorities insist on their course and continue to obstruct and sabotage the normal supply of daily necessities to compatriots in Hong Kong, all responsibilities and consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the British Hong Kong authorities.

    港英妄图利用大米存仓问题破坏爱国工人罢工斗争
    我粮油食品进出口公司向英帝强烈抗议
    新华社二日讯　中国粮油食品进出口公司今天发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局妄图以大米存仓问题来破坏我国大米对香港的正常供应，破坏香港爱国工人的大罢工，破坏香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争。
    声明指出，最近港英当局在疯狂镇压香港爱国同胞的同时，竟对我正常供应香港四百万同胞日常生活必需品，进行种种阻碍和破坏。港英当局继七月十八日非法搜查我经文锦渡运往九龙的副食品货车后，近来又对我出口大米在香港存放仓库的问题进行无理刁难和横加阻挠。声明指出，这显然是港英当局对我一种有计划、有预谋的挑衅行为。
    声明说，我们坚决支持我香港代理行华润公司在七月二十八日就港英当局阻挠我大米对香港的正常出口问题提出的严重抗议。
    声明强烈谴责港英当局对我供应香港大米一贯采取仇视态度，实行限制和歧视的反动政策。声明说，最近这种反动政策更加发展到疯狂的程度。六月份以来，为了坚决反击港英当局残酷镇压我香港爱国同胞的法西斯暴行，香港爱国工人举行了声势浩大的大罢工。我香港代理行华润公司为了坚决支持这一正义斗争，决定不将我大米存放在受罢工工人制裁的货仓。同时，为了照顾香港同胞对大米的需要，经同大米进口商协商，将我供应香港的大米存入罢工工人同意卸货而又领有储米许可证的货仓。这完全是合情合理的。但是，港英当局肆意捏造华润公司“强迫”大米进口商将我大米存入招商局等四家货仓的谎言，悍然撤销招商局等四家货仓储存大米的许可证，无理注销某些大米进口商的进口许可证上盖有“可以存入任何批准的货仓”的戳印。这是港英当局的一个大阴谋。
    声明严正警告港英当局，你们妄图利用大米存仓问题破坏香港爱国工人的大罢工，一千个办不到，一万个办不到。你们必须立即收回撤销招商局等四家货仓储存大米许可的无理决定，立即停止对我出口大米采取的一切限制和歧视措施。如果港英当局一意孤行，继续阻挠和破坏我对香港同胞生活必需品的正常供应，由此而产生的一切责任和后果，必须由港英当局承担。
