The Marxist-Leninists in Sweden held a representative congress from June 23 to 25 and formally established the "Marxist-Leninist Communist League."

The congress adopted the "General Principles," "Constitution," "Program of Action," and "Most Urgent Tasks" of the League, and elected B. Gustavsson as the chairman and F. Bode as the vice-chairman.

The "General Principles" state: "The task of the Marxist-Leninist Communist League is to prepare for the rebuilding of a Marxist-Leninist party in Sweden. Before this task is accomplished, the League will strive to fulfill the responsibilities of a Marxist-Leninist party on a broader scale."

The "General Principles" further state that the task of a Marxist-Leninist party is to initiate, participate in, and lead various forms of class struggle aimed at ending the dictatorship of monopoly capital and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a necessary condition for the people to shatter the class rule of monopoly capital, establish a socialist social order, and carry out the class struggle to a classless communist society."

The "General Principles" point out that the activities of the League are guided by Marxist-Leninist principles and work within the working class to oppose revisionism, sectarianism, and other manifestations of bourgeois influence.

The "Program of Action" emphasizes the need to "fight against monopoly capital, against class collaboration, and against imperialism."

The "Program of Action" stipulates that in the international class struggle, the League should oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, expose and oppose the cooperation between Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists, and support the struggle of the Soviet and Eastern European peoples against the ruling leadership's restoration of capitalism.

In the "Most Urgent Tasks," the League calls on its members to study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, and to draw lessons from the actual situations in Sweden and internationally. The League also stresses the need to strengthen and expand the publication and distribution of the League's newspapers, "Marxist Forum" and "Spark," to recruit new members, establish new grassroots organizations, and strengthen the League organizationally.

    “总则”说，马列主义政党的任务是开展、参加和领导目的在于结束垄断资本专政、建立无产阶级专政的各种形式的阶级斗争。“无产阶级专政是人民打碎垄断资本的阶级统治、建立社会主义的社会秩序、把阶级斗争进行到没有阶级的共产主义社会的必要条件。”
    “总则”指出，联盟的活动以马列主义的原则为指导，在工人阶级中反对修正主义、宗派主义和其他资产阶级影响的表现。
    联盟的“行动纲领”强调要“为反对垄断资本、反对阶级合作和反对帝国主义而斗争”。
    “行动纲领”规定联盟在国际阶级斗争中，要反对美帝国主义及其走狗，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，支持越南人民的斗争，揭露和反对苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义者的合作，支持苏联和东欧人民反对当政的领导集团复辟资本主义的斗争。
    联盟在“最迫切的工作任务”中，号召联盟成员学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，学习毛主席著作，并且联系到瑞典的、国际的实际情况，从中得出瑞典应汲取的教益。
    联盟还强调，要加强和扩大发行联盟的报刊《马克思主义论坛》和《星火》，发展新盟员、建立新的基层组织和在组织上壮大联盟。
