In the new high tide of the "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" movement in the Wuhan area, the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently invited the responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations in the Wuhan area to hold a symposium. They jointly reviewed the "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" activities of the recent period and formulated measures for further carrying out these activities.

The responsible comrades of the Wuhan garrison and the revolutionary mass organizations in the Wuhan area who participated in the symposium once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's great policy of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" and Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions on "Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They gave high praise to the "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" activities of the previous stage, but at the same time, they unanimously pointed out that these activities still fell far short of Chairman Mao's expectations and the expectations of the revolutionary masses nationwide. The current task is to push the "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" activities to a new high tide, raise them to a new and higher level, achieve greater victories, and carry out the great criticism even better. They vowed to be models of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People."

Commander Zeng Siyuan of the Wuhan Military Region, in his speech, first expressed his thanks to the proletarian revolutionary faction for the large amount of work they had done in supporting the army. He then said, "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" is the consistent great thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has an immeasurable special significance. It is a great strategic measure to promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the general principle for correctly handling military-civilian relations in the Cultural Revolution, and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Cultural Revolution. In the great practice of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," we have a deeper understanding of this point.

Based on the situation of the army's "Loving the People" activities in the previous period, Zeng Siyuan proposed several important measures for the Wuhan Military Region to further strengthen "Loving the People" activities:

First, the army should widely organize Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to further propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses, propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and propagate the policies and directives of the Party Central Committee. This will provide political and ideological support to the broad proletarian revolutionary faction. The broad cadres and fighters should also, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, arm the proletarian revolutionary faction with Mao Zedong Thought, and fundamentally do a good job in loving the people.

Second, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction, and resolutely stand with the proletarian revolutionary faction, sharing the same breath and fate. Love what the left loves, hate what the left hates, think what the left thinks, and help what the left needs. Actively help to develop and strengthen the leftist forces, and help the proletarian revolutionary faction to do a good job in great unity, great criticism, and great alliance.

Third, it is necessary to do a good job in the education of the army on the two classes, two roads, and two lines struggle, and further raise the consciousness of executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Actively and seriously help the left to do a good job in military training and militia work, and build a stronger revolutionary people's armed forces.

Fourth, the army's leading cadres should follow Chairman Mao's great directive of "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." They should lead the broad cadres and fighters to go among the masses, do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, and strictly follow the three major disciplines and eight points for attention. They should correctly treat the masses, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and strongly support the broad revolutionary masses in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations such as "Gangong General," "Gangong Second," "Gangong September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Commissions Revolutionary Alliance" unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao on "Supporting the Army and Loving the People." They vowed to be models of "Supporting the Army" and truly achieve unity of heart with the People's Liberation Army, fight together with the People's Liberation Army, and achieve victory together with the People's Liberation Army. They believed that to truly achieve supporting the army, one must first recognize in thought the great strategic significance of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People." The proletarian revolutionary faction must hold high the great banner of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions of "three trusts" and "three relies." They must firmly trust and rely on the People's Liberation Army.

They linked the critical moments in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when they were defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, with their personal experiences of closely uniting with and fighting together with the cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. They unanimously said that the People's Liberation Army is most loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, most loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They see through the class enemies the clearest, recognize them the most, fear no hardships, and strongly support and defend the proletarian revolutionary faction. In the struggle practice, they deeply felt that "without a people's army, there is nothing" is an unshakable great truth.

They expressed that they would resolutely learn from the great People's Liberation Army, which was personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. They would learn from the advanced experience of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learn from the People's Liberation Army's emphasis on proletarian politics, adherence to the four firsts, promotion of the three-eight style, and model observance of the three major disciplines and eight points for attention. They would further strengthen their revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, and firmly fight against "I-ism," break private interests and establish public interests, and overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds such as individualism, sectarianism, cliquism, factionalism, and small-groupism. They would resolutely, together with the broad cadres and fighters, carry out the great criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and disgrace China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area, and completely smash the bourgeois headquarters.

For the army that has achieved new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction should widely propagate their heroic deeds, making them known to every household, so that the broad revolutionary masses will more consciously love and support the People's Liberation Army and learn from the People's Liberation Army.

Political Commissar Liu Feng of the Wuhan Military Region emphasized in his speech that the great practice of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" once again proves that the teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao, "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history," is an unshakable truth. The people's army, the people's children, are forever the guards of the people and also forever the students of the people. Only by first being good students of the left can we truly support and defend the left. The better we learn from the left, the more we support the left, the more new victories we can achieve. The class enemies are most afraid of military-civilian unity and most afraid of military-civilian unity in establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose," and be more resolute and more closely united, strengthening and developing the combat friendship between the military and the people a thousandfold.

Political Commissar Xiao Qian of the Wuhan Military Region Air Force and the responsible comrades of the recently established Wuhan Garrison Command, Fang Ming, also participated in the symposium and spoke on the issue of loving the people.

The symposium was filled with the atmosphere of military-civilian unity and joint struggle against the enemy.

    武汉驻军和革命群众组织负责人提出“拥军爱民”的重要措施
    千百倍地巩固和发展军民战斗友谊
    扎扎实实把“拥军爱民”活动提到更高水平，把革命的大批判搞得好上加好
    新华社武汉二十二日电　在武汉地区拥军爱民活动新高潮中，人民解放军武汉部队负责人最近邀请武汉地区革命群众组织负责人座谈，共同认真检查了最近一段“拥军爱民”活动的情况，制定了进一步开展“拥军爱民”活动的措施。
    参加座谈的武汉驻军和武汉地区革命群众组织负责人，再一次认真学习了毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大方针，学习了林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的最新指示，对前一阶段拥军爱民活动给予很高评价，同时也一致指出，这离毛主席对他们的期望，离全国无产阶级革命派对他们的期望还差得很远。现在的任务是要扎扎实实地把拥军爱民活动推向一个新高潮，提到新的更高水平，取得更大的胜利，把革命的大批判搞得好上加好，誓作“拥军爱民”的模范。
    武汉部队司令员曾思玉在发言中，首先对无产阶级革命派在拥军中所做的大量工作表示感谢。接着他说，“拥军爱民”是伟大领袖毛主席一贯的伟大思想，在无产阶级文化大革命中更有着不可估量的特殊意义。它是推进无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略措施，是在文化大革命中正确处理军民关系的总原则，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利的根本保证，在“拥军爱民”的伟大实践中，我们对这一点体会更深。
    曾思玉根据前一时期部队开展“爱民”活动的情况，对武汉部队今后如何进一步加强“爱民”活动提出了几条重要措施：
    第一，部队要广泛组织毛泽东思想宣传队，进一步向广大革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，宣传党中央的方针、政策，从政治上、思想上支持广大无产阶级革命派。广大指战员还要同无产阶级革命派一起，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，从根本上做好爱民工作；
    第二，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以无产阶级革命派为师，坚决向无产阶级革命派学习，虚心听取无产阶级革命派的意见，坚决同无产阶级革命派站在一起，同呼吸、共命运，爱左派所爱，恨左派所恨，想左派所想，帮左派所需。积极帮助发展壮大左派队伍，帮助无产阶级革命派搞好革命大团结、大批判、大联合；
    第三，一定要搞好部队的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，进一步提高执行、捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。积极认真帮助左派做好军训工作和民兵工作，建立一支更强大的革命的人民武装；
    第四，部队的领导干部要遵循毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的伟大指示，认真带领广大干部战士到群众中去，做好“三支”“两军”工作，认真执行三大纪律八项注意，正确对待群众，进一步加强军民团结，大力支持广大革命群众搞好“抓革命，促生产”。
    “钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命群众组织的负责人在发言中一致表示：要更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，誓做“拥军”的模范，真正做到与解放军心连心，同解放军团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。他们认为，要真正做到拥军，必须首先在思想上认识拥军爱民的伟大战略意义。无产阶级革命派必须高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，按照毛主席“三相信”、“三依靠”的指示办事，坚决相信和依靠人民解放军。
    他们联系在无产阶级文化大革命中，在誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的斗争的关键时刻，与人民解放军指战员紧密团结、共同战斗的亲身经历，一致说，人民解放军最忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席，最忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对阶级敌人看得最准，认得最清，不怕艰难险阻，有力地支持和保卫了无产阶级革命派，在斗争实践中，我们进一步深刻体会到“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    他们表示：坚决向毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民解放军学习。学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验，学习解放军突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、模范遵守三大纪律八项注意，进一步加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，狠斗“我”字，破私立公，克服头脑中的个人主义、风头主义、山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义等各种非无产阶级思想。坚决同广大指战员一起，搞好革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    对于在无产阶级文化大革命中建立新功的部队，无产阶级革命派要广泛宣传他们的英雄事迹，做到家喻户晓，使广大革命群众更自觉地热爱和拥护解放军，学习解放军。
    武汉部队政委刘丰在发言中强调指出：拥军爱民的伟大实践，再一次证明伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”是颠扑不破的真理。人民的军队、人民的子弟兵，永远是人民的警卫兵，也永远是人民的小学生。只有首先当好左派的学生，才能真正支持好左派，保卫好左派。向左派学习得越好，对左派支持得越多，立新功也才能立得越多。阶级敌人最怕军民团结，最怕军民团结大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，千方百计阴谋破坏我们亲密无间的军民关系。我们一定要牢记毛主席的“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，更加坚决更加紧密地团结在一起，千百倍地巩固和发展军民之间的战斗友谊。
    武汉部队空军政委萧前、最近成立的武汉警备区负责人方铭也参加了座谈，并在会上就爱民问题作了发言。
    座谈会充满了军民团结、共同对敌的气氛。
