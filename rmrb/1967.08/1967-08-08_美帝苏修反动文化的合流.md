The recent "Fifth Moscow International Film Festival" organized by the Soviet revisionist clique in collusion with U.S. imperialism is a grand exhibition of reactionary culture by imperialism and modern revisionism. It is another act in the counterrevolutionary farce staged by the Soviet revisionist traitors.

In this "film festival," the Soviet revisionist clique not only peddled a lot of junk such as bourgeois humanitarianism, pacifism, and Western lifestyle, but also shamelessly glorified the "honeymoon coexistence" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and frenziedly incited anti-China sentiment. This "film festival" further shows that the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists are closely colluding politically and economically and have completely become one in cultural terms.

It is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist clique bows down to the most decadent and ugly culture of imperialism, treating boils as treasures and inheriting everything from it. Modern revisionism is originally an appendage of imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique itself is a bourgeois clique. They do not have and cannot have any independent ideology or culture. Their culture can only be reactionary bourgeois goods, only the garbage picked up from imperialism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line."

The reason why the Soviet revisionist traitors are so eager to pursue and propagate Western culture is not only because they have a common stench but also because of political necessity, serving their revisionist line.

Internationally, the Soviet revisionist clique engages in "cultural exchanges" with the U.S. to create an atmosphere for Soviet-U.S. "friendship" and to manufacture public opinion for their capitulation to U.S. imperialism. They use culture and art as tools to carry out their anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counterrevolutionary policies to serve U.S. imperialism.

Domestically, the Soviet revisionist clique allows Western culture to spread rampantly, poisoning people's minds and corrupting their souls. Their purpose is to make the Soviet people forget class struggle and revolution, so that this small clique of traitors can fully restore capitalism, so that the bourgeois privileged class can ride roughshod over the people, and so that the likes of Brezhnev and Kosygin can maintain their shaky "throne."

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has made the Soviet Union a mess, which is absolutely intolerable to the Soviet people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Soviet people will surely rise up in rebellion and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and their reactionary culture!

### 美帝苏修反动文化的合流

    美帝苏修反动文化的合流
    最近，苏修集团勾结美帝国主义，搞了一次所谓“第五届莫斯科国际电影节”。这是帝国主义和现代修正主义的反动文化的一次大展览，是苏修叛徒演出的又一幕反革命丑剧。
    苏修集团在这次“电影节”中，不仅大肆贩卖资产阶级人道主义、和平主义、西方生活方式等破烂货，而且肉麻地渲染美苏之间的“蜜月共处”，疯狂地煽动反华。这次“电影节”进一步表明，苏修和美帝在政治上、经济上加紧勾结，在文化上也完全同流合污了。
    苏修集团拜倒在帝国主义的最腐朽、最丑恶的文化面前，把痈疽当作宝贝，全部继承过来，这是不奇怪的。现代修正主义本来就是帝国主义的附庸。苏修集团本身就是资产阶级。他们根本就没有、也不可能有什么独立的思想文化。他们的文化只能是反动的资产阶级的货色，只能是从帝国主义那里拣来的垃圾。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    苏修叛徒之所以这样狂热地追求和宣扬西方文化，不只是因为臭味相投，而且是出于政治上的需要，是为他们的修正主义路线服务的。
    在国际上，苏修集团大搞苏美“文化交流”，是为苏美“亲善”创造气氛，为投靠美帝制造舆论。他们利用文化艺术作为推行反华、反共、反人民、反革命政策的工具，来替美帝国主义效劳。
    在国内，苏修集团让西方文化大肆泛滥，毒化人们的思想，腐蚀人们的灵魂，其目的是要苏联人民忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉革命，以便于这一小撮叛徒全面复辟资本主义，便于资产阶级特权阶层骑在人民头上作威作福，便于勃列日?夫、柯西金之流维持他们摇摇欲坠的儿皇帝“宝座”。
    苏修叛徒集团把苏联搞得乌烟瘴气，这是具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民所绝对不能容忍的。苏联人民一定会起来造反，把苏修集团的反动统治及其反动文化，统统打倒！
