De Gaulle uses visit to Canada to undermine the United States
Incites French-Canadians to establish a "nation" to expand French influence
Pro-American Canadian government is very annoyed, U.S. newspapers advocate breaking off relations with France

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated August 3rd, French President Charles de Gaulle recently visited Canada, a Commonwealth nation under U.S. control. This visit once again exposed the deep-seated contradictions within the imperialist camp that cannot be overcome.

De Gaulle's visit to Canada in late July was a continuation of his 1964 visit to Latin America, where he stirred up trouble in the United States' backyard. This is a new step in de Gaulle's global strategy to oppose U.S. hegemony.

The arrangements for this visit were unusual. According to the original plan, de Gaulle's five-day activities were to be spent in the first four days accepting the invitation of the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, in this province where French immigrants and their descendants reside, and the remaining time was to be spent in the Canadian capital, Ottawa. Among Canada's 19 million people, there are more than 6 million French-Canadians, most of whom live in Quebec.

After arriving in Quebec on July 23, de Gaulle gave speeches everywhere, using the special relationship of shared language and ethnicity to expand French influence in Quebec, aiming to use this "French-speaking America" as a base to counter the United States and exclude Britain. He propagated that the "French-speaking region of Canada is a nation that needs to govern itself," that French-Canadians should "take control of their own destiny," and he shouted, "Long live free Quebec!"

De Gaulle's actions in Quebec made the pro-American Canadian government very annoyed. Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson issued a statement publicly criticizing de Gaulle's remarks as "unacceptable to the Canadian government," and the Canadian government "will oppose any action that seeks to destroy Canadian unity." Some Canadian parliamentarians even demanded that the government order de Gaulle to leave Canada immediately. Under these circumstances, de Gaulle canceled the originally planned 30-hour state visit to Ottawa and returned to France early. No members of the Canadian cabinet went to the airport to see him off.

    戴高乐利用加拿大之行挖美国墙脚
    煽动法裔加拿大人建立“国家”以扩大法国影响  加拿大亲美政府十分恼火，美报鼓吹同法断交
    据新华社三日讯  法国总统戴高乐最近访问了美国控制下的英联邦国家加拿大。这次访问又一次暴露了帝国主义阵营内部无法克服的重重矛盾。
    戴高乐七月下旬对加拿大的访问，是他一九六四年访问拉丁美洲，深入美国后院，煽风点火，挖美国墙脚的行动的继续。这是戴高乐推行反对美国霸权的全球战略的新的一步。
    这次访问的安排一反常规。按原订计划，戴高乐为期五天的活动头四天是接受加拿大魁北克省总督的邀请，在这个法国移民后裔聚居的省份进行，剩下最后一天多的时间，准备到加拿大首都渥太华活动。在加拿大一千九百万人口中，法裔加拿大人有六百多万，大部分聚居在魁北克省。
    戴高乐七月二十三日到达魁北克以后，到处发表演说，利用同文同种的特殊关系，扩大法国在魁北克的影响，想利用这一“法语美洲”的阵地，对抗美国、排斥英国。他宣传“加拿大法语地区是一个需要自己当家作主的国家”，法裔加拿大人应当“自己掌握自己的命运”，并且高呼“自由的魁北克万岁！”
    戴高乐在魁北克的言行，使亲美的加拿大政府十分恼火。加拿大总理皮尔逊发表声明公开指责戴高乐的言论是“加拿大政府所不能接受的”，加拿大政府“将反对要破坏加拿大统一的任何行动”。一些加拿大议员甚至要求政府勒令戴高乐立即离开加拿大。在上述情况下，戴高乐取消了原定到渥太华的三十个小时的国事访问，提前回国。加拿大内阁阁员没有一个到机场送行。
    戴高乐在加拿大的活动使美国统治集团十分不安，美国报纸连日来大骂戴高乐的加拿大之行是“对美国的攻击”，甚至鼓吹加拿大政府同戴高乐政府“断绝外交关系”。
