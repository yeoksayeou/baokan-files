People of various countries have used the most enthusiastic language to praise the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They say: "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism," "it is the guiding ideology of the world revolution," "it is a great milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism." China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an "unprecedented, earth-shaking revolution in human history," a "great revolution that touches the soul, eliminates bourgeois elements, and prevents the emergence of revisionism."

A Vietnamese friend fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle recently wrote an article saying: We have great confidence in our powerful rear guard—the seven hundred million great Chinese people. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shaken the world. This is an unprecedented, earth-shaking revolution in human history, carried out by socialist China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people and all proletarians in the world.

The article says, today, the Vietnamese people and all oppressed nations in the world regard revolutionary new China as their hope, as the base of the world revolution. The Communist Party of China has become the vanguard of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of the world revolution.

The chairman of the 14th delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) said, the broad revolutionary masses in China have all been mobilized in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have well applied Mao Zedong Thought in the movement, educating themselves and liberating themselves, and they have the confidence to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. He summed up his impressions in one sentence: "The Chinese people are turning the whole of China into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." He also said: "I firmly believe that only by turning China into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought can the victory of the world revolution be guaranteed."

Japanese revolutionary youth Suzuki said: "The great October Revolution of Russia once gave great encouragement to the proletariat of the whole world. Now, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China gives even greater encouragement to the proletariat of the whole world." Suzuki also said, Chairman Mao has solved a series of problems in theory and practice regarding how the proletariat, after seizing power, consolidates proletarian dictatorship and prevents socialist countries from changing color. This shows that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the world revolution, and as the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America develop and achieve victories, this truth will be proven more and more widely.

The chairman of the women's delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is not only related to the future and destiny of China but also to the future and destiny of the world revolution. It shows the revolutionary people of the world how, after seizing power and establishing proletarian dictatorship, to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, prevent the emergence of revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Sazuki said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of Japan. We must resolutely support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Inoue Kiyoko said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism; it is a struggle by the revolutionary faction of the proletariat to seize power from the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the party; at the same time, it is a great revolution that touches the soul, eliminates bourgeois elements, and prevents the emergence of revisionism.

The chairman of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Wahab Za'in Abdin, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "The red star that went out in the Kremlin has shone again from Tiananmen, illuminating the path forward for the peoples of the world."

Wahab recently visited China. He praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as a historic revolution. He said, this revolution, "besides exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, a new generation with a new worldview is growing up. They understand that the proletarian cultural revolution will not only prevent the restoration of capitalism in China but will also support the national revolutionary movements of the oppressed countries in Asia and Africa that are fighting against imperialism and revisionism."

A member of the Sudan-China Friendship Association who recently visited China, Rafai, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is like a raging sea, surging and crashing down on those power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. He said, China's proletarian dictatorship will become more and more consolidated, and the genuine support for all revolutionary peoples and oppressed nations in the world will also increase more and more.

A friend from Botswana said: "Imperialists and revisionists talk nonsense, opposing the great People's Republic of China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, after visiting China, I can tell these gentlemen: You are all liars. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a historical necessity and has great significance for all the peoples of the world. "Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the young generation in China is being trained to become revolutionary successors. The imperialists' and revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in China can never be realized."

A middle-aged worker from the German Democratic Republic said: "The specific situations of revolutions in various countries are different, but the basic principles of the cultural revolution are universally applicable." He also said: "The saying that there are three great milestones in the history of Marxism is completely correct."

Another old worker said: "The Cultural Revolution in China is correct. It is the most effective method to prevent the restoration of capitalism and prevent revisionism."

The revolutionary people of Poland highly praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, believing that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao in China and the October Revolution led by Lenin in Russia have equal great significance." An old man said: "Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism, initiating this great movement of epoch-making significance, the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese people are advancing in the correct direction. Therefore, all the peoples of the world, including us, must follow the Chinese people and follow the path indicated by Mao Zedong. I believe that the Mao Zedong line will definitely be victorious."

    各国革命人民热烈赞颂中国文化大革命
    天安门上的红星照亮了世界人民前进的道路
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国革命人民用最热情的语言，赞颂伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想和我国无产阶级文化大革命。他们说：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”，“是世界革命的指导思想”，“是马克思列宁主义发展史上的伟大里程碑”。中国无产阶级文化大革命，是“人类历史上空前未有的惊天动地的大革命”，“触及人们灵魂的、灭资兴无、防止产生修正主义的伟大革命”。
    战斗在抗美斗争前线的一位越南朋友最近写了一篇文章说：我们非常信赖自己的强大后方——七亿伟大的中国人民。中国的无产阶级文化大革命震动了全世界。这是社会主义中国在毛泽东主席的英明领导下所进行的人类历史上空前未有的惊天动地的大革命。毛主席是亿万人民心中的红太阳，是中国人民和全世界无产者的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。
    文章说，今天，越南人民和全世界被压迫民族都把革命的新中国看作是自己的希望，是世界革命的根据地。中国共产党已经成为世界革命的旗手。毛泽东思想是世界革命的灯塔。
    日中友协（正统）总部第十四次活动家代表团团长中村九一郎说，中国广大的革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中都发动起来了，他们在运动中很好地运用毛泽东思想，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，并且有信心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他用一句话来概括他的观感说：“中国人民正在把整个中国办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校。”他还说：“我坚信，只有把中国办成毛泽东思想的大学校，世界革命的胜利才有保证。”
    日本革命青年铃木说：“伟大的俄国十月革命曾经给全世界无产阶级很大鼓舞，现在，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利给全世界无产阶级以更大的鼓舞。”铃木还说，毛主席从理论上和实践上解决了无产阶级在取得政权后，巩固无产阶级专政、防止社会主义国家变色的一系列问题。这表明，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛泽东思想是世界革命的指导思想，随着亚非拉人民的革命斗争的胜利发展，这一真理必将得到越来越广泛的证明。
    日中友协（正统）总部妇女访华代表团团长中岛千代说：中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅关系到中国的前途和命运，而且关系到世界革命的前途和命运。它向全世界革命人民指出了无产阶级在夺取政权建立无产阶级专政以后，怎样巩固无产阶级专政，防止产生修正主义和出现资本主义复辟。
    细木说，中国无产阶级文化大革命对日本革命人民是一个巨大鼓舞，我们要坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    井上喜代歌说：中国无产阶级文化大革命是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的你死我活的斗争；它是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，同时也是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是一场灭资兴无、防止产生修正主义的伟大革命。
    苏丹—中国友好协会主席瓦哈卜·宰因·阿卜丁对新华社记者说：“克里姆林宫熄灭了的红星，又从天安门上照亮了世界人民前进的道路。”
    瓦哈卜不久前访问了中国。他赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命是划时代的革命。他说，这场革命，“除了揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派外，具有新世界观的年青一代正在成长。他们懂得，无产阶级文化革命将不仅防止资本主义在中国复辟，而且支持了正在同帝国主义和修正主义进行斗争的亚非被压迫国家的民族革命运动。”
    最近访问过中国的苏丹—中国友好协会的成员罗法伊对新华社记者说，中国无产阶级文化大革命正象怒海狂潮，汹涌澎湃地冲垮了那些走资本主义道路的当权派。他说，中国的无产阶级专政将越来越巩固，同时对全世界一切革命人民和被压迫民族的真正支持也将越来越多。
    博茨瓦纳一位朋友说：“帝国主义者和修正主义者胡言乱语，反对伟大的中华人民共和国和中国无产阶级文化大革命。现在，在我访问了中国以后，我可以告诉这些先生们：你们全是骗子。这次无产阶级文化大革命是历史的必然产物，对于全世界人民具有重大意义。”“通过无产阶级文化大革命，中国的年青一代正在被培养成革命接班人。帝国主义者和修正主义者要在中国实现他们的资本主义复辟的美梦，根本不可能实现。”
    德意志民主共和国一位中年工人说：“各国革命的具体情况虽然不同，但是文化大革命的基本原则是普遍适用的。”他还说：“马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑的说法是完全正确的。”
    另一位老工人说：“中国文化大革命是正确的。是防止资本主义复辟、防止修正主义的一个最有效的方法。”
    波兰革命人民高度赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，认为“毛主席所领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命和列宁领导的俄国十月革命具有同等的重大意义。”一位老人说：“毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，发动了文化大革命这个具有划时代意义的运动，中国人民沿着正确的方向前进。因此全世界人民包括我们在内，都要象中国人民一样，跟着毛泽东，沿着毛泽东所指引的道路前进。我相信，毛泽东路线一定胜利”。
