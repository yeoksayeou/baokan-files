For the safety of comrades

In 1966, during a battle near the village of Pei in Sa Wang Ling Ruan County, Sakon Nakhon Province, Thailand, fifty reactionary military police surrounded the people's armed forces. The villagers of Pei, Mao Ka Xi Tong and his friend, in order to distract the enemy and allow their comrades to break through the enemy's encirclement and safely evacuate, bravely fought against the enemy. They had only one flintlock gun and one pistol, but they tightly held onto the enemy without letting go. After their ammunition ran out, the two of them fearlessly charged towards the enemy with bare hands, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. They killed two enemies and seriously injured ten before they themselves bravely sacrificed their lives. By then, the people's armed forces had already safely evacuated to another place.

    为了战友的安全
    一九六六年在泰国沙功那空府沙旺铃粦县培村附近的一次战斗中，五十名反动军警从四面包围了人民武装力量。培村的村民茂·卡西通和他的朋友，为了牵制敌人，使战友能够突破敌人包围，安全转移，同敌人展开了英勇的战斗。他们手里只有一枝火药枪和一枝手枪，但是却把敌人紧紧地咬住不放。在子弹打光后，他们两人又奋不顾身地赤手空拳扑向敌人，同敌人展开肉搏战。他们在打死敌人两名和重伤敌人十名后，也英勇地壮烈牺牲。而这时人民武装已安全地转移到了别处。
