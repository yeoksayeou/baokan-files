Vice Chairman Lin's inscription for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The delegates to the conference were greatly inspired. The good news spread to all units, from headquarters to platoons, and everyone was overjoyed.

New China News Agency, August 10th: The close comrade-in-arms of the great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, inscribed for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This greatly inspired all the delegates present at the conference. These outstanding soldiers who have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and achieved excellent results in the Cultural Revolution expressed with great emotion that they would resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call, hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further launch a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and achieve greater results in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, achieving new victories for the people.

On the evening of the 9th, Beijing Garrison Commander Fu Chongbi, amidst thunderous applause, conveyed Vice Chairman Lin Biao's warm concern to all the delegates and displayed Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to the entire assembly. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the delegates waved their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," facing the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging high on the stage, and shouted excitedly for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Thank you, Vice Chairman Lin, for your warm concern!"

This was an unforgettable night. Over five hundred delegates excitedly held discussions and meetings throughout the night, and some even wrote letters of resolve, pledges, and letters of gratitude. They unanimously said: In this great new era of Mao Zedong Thought sweeping the world, at the moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shakes the world, achieves decisive victories, and in the midst of the triumphant songs of the great criticism of the Khrushchev Revisionist in China, our most, most great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, inscribed for us. This is a great joyous event in our military's political life. The inscription is a mobilization order, a call to advance, a new direction for the entire army to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and a higher requirement for the entire army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Ten thousand songs cannot express our boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, ten thousand words cannot express our boundless faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we cannot express our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

At the discussion meetings and symposiums, the delegates all expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call. A platoon leader and member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, Kong Xiangxiu, who has been an active learner of Chairman Mao's works for several consecutive years, made contributions in defending the great leader Chairman Mao and the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing. He said: I deeply feel that reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao is the highest ideal and the greatest happiness. He resolved to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, diligently and tirelessly serve the proletarian revolution and the broad masses of the people. Beijing Revolutionary Committee member and supply officer of a certain regiment, Huang Jinxiang, who is deeply loved by the revolutionary masses, firmly stated at the meeting that in the "support left" work, he would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly support the broad leftist masses, think what the leftists think, worry about what the leftists worry about, and help what the leftists need. He would pass on the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May 4th Movement to the proletarian revolutionaries, so that they would always uphold proletarian politics, always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ensuring that our country will never change color.

The good news of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription spread to all units of the Beijing Garrison, from headquarters to platoons, and everywhere was filled with joy. Many platoons held celebration meetings late into the night and sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the platoons to announce the good news. The soldiers of a certain unit's First Platoon, guarding at Tiananmen, gathered in front of Chairman Mao's giant portrait at Tiananmen and held a celebration meeting. The soldiers sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" The joyous songs and slogans echoed throughout Tiananmen Square.
