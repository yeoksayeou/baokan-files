The two faithful running dogs of U.S. imperialism in Indonesia—Suharto and Nasution, along with the two factions of right-wing forces led by them—are now staging a dog-eat-dog farce. This fight between big dogs and small dogs, well-fed dogs and hungry dogs, reflects the disintegration and desperate plight of the Indonesian fascist ruling clique.

This dog-eat-dog farce has become more open since March this year when Suharto usurped the position of "acting president." Suharto and Nasution, who had joined forces to carry out anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people activities, have always had sharp conflicts of interest. For more than a decade, the old U.S. imperialist running dog Nasution has been dreaming of seizing the presidency. In March this year, he saw the crown of "acting president" snatched away by another U.S. imperialist running dog, Suharto. Thus, the alliance between the right-wing military figures led by Suharto and Nasution has shown cracks, and the conflicts between Suharto and Nasution have become more apparent, with the dog-eat-dog farce intensifying.

Since March, the right-wing forces led by Nasution, while crazily suppressing Indonesian communists and revolutionary people and engaging in anti-Chinese activities, have been desperately attacking Suharto and using every means to weaken Suharto's power. This old right-wing warlord recently exploited the discontent of the right-wing parties, these hungry dogs, towards the military fascist regime, raising the banner of opposing "militarism" and advocating "democratic politics" to attack Suharto's faction continuously and creating public opinion to pave the way for his own rise to power.

The main issues in this struggle revolve around so-called "general elections" and "corruption and smuggling."

As soon as Suharto took over the position of "acting president," Nasution emphasized that "military power and political power should be separated and not combined," forcing Suharto to give up his concurrent position as Army Commander at the end of April and appointing Nasution's confidant Panggabean as acting Army Commander. To further seize the presidency, Nasution, under the banner of "upholding the 1945 Constitution," criticized Suharto for delaying the "general elections" and mobilized the puppet tools he controlled, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the Consultative Assembly, as well as right-wing student organizations and parties, to issue statements, hold demonstrations, and create a stir, attacking Suharto for opposing "parliamentary democracy." On June 12, Nasution also threatened Suharto through the spokesman of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, Supolo: "Without the approval of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, the (Suharto) government cannot postpone the 1968 general elections."

Nasution also used the pretext of "anti-corruption and smuggling" to incite right-wing student organizations to pressure Suharto, demanding that Suharto arrest 22 of his corrupt military officials and seizing on the widespread corruption, smuggling, and looting by Suharto's military regime to launch attacks. The "Indonesian Student Action Front," which was cultivated by Nasution and received support from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, had more than 3,000 members who, on May 20, under the banner of "anti-corruption," took advantage of Suharto's military parade in Bandung to rush into the venue, hold demonstrations, and cause a commotion, putting Suharto in an extremely embarrassing situation and forcing him to order the opening of fire to disperse the demonstrators.

The other running dog, Suharto, who is favored by U.S. imperialism, is not weak in this dogfight. To maintain and consolidate his rule, Suharto, using the excuse of "technical difficulties" and "lack of funds for the expected general elections," refused to hold "general elections" in 1968. He emphasized that the armed forces, which he controls, must occupy 25% of the seats in the parliament.

Suharto also took up the banner of "anti-corruption," using poison to attack poison, and placing the responsibility on Nasution. He compiled a list of corrupt officials from Nasution's faction, summoned and expelled some of Nasution's faction's military and political officials and confidants. Suharto publicly accused the Nasution group of "trying to create chaos in this country" and issued a warning that "groups attempting to sabotage the cabinet must not be tolerated." In July, Suharto issued a "special directive" to his loyal troops, the Army Strategic Reserve Command, formally ordering the elimination of dissenters. Suharto made it clear that the elimination of dissenters was to avoid being "strangled." Antara News Agency called Suharto's decision a "lightning-fast purge."

The military mouthpiece, the "Armed Forces Newspaper," in a commentary on May 23, revealed the essence of this farce of thieves shouting "catch the thief" and dogs fighting among themselves when it talked about the "negative phenomena" within the right-wing group. It said, "This is just a quarrel for the interests of the group."

Our great leader Chairman Mao in his article "On the Strategy for Defeating Japanese Imperialism" discussed the situation of dogs fighting within the Chiang Kai-shek clique and pointed out: "... This is just a particularly interesting struggle between big dogs and small dogs, well-fed dogs and hungry dogs, a small gap, a kind of itchy and painful contradiction. However, this struggle, this gap, this contradiction, is useful for the revolutionary people."

The dogfight within the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique has entered the open stage, but more intense struggles lie ahead. The two right-wing forces led by Suharto and Nasution have common interests in anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people activities, but their dogfight for counter-revolutionary power is a life-and-death, irreconcilable struggle. This extremely reactionary military clique is in a predicament both internally and externally, and their infighting will make them more isolated, bringing their downfall sooner.

    饱狗饿狗大争斗　两条走狗狗咬狗
    印尼法西斯统治集团分崩离析日暮途穷
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的两条忠实走狗——苏哈托和纳苏蒂安以及以他们为首的两股右派势力之间正在上演一场狗咬狗的丑剧。这场大狗小狗饱狗饿狗之间的争斗，反映了印尼法西斯统治集团内部分崩离析，日暮途穷。
    这场狗咬狗的丑剧从今年三月间苏哈托篡夺“代总统”职务以后更加公开化。为了共同进行反共反华反人民的勾当而互相勾结起来的苏哈托和纳苏蒂安，彼此间本来就存在着尖锐的利害矛盾。十多年来一直梦想窃据总统职位的美帝老牌走狗纳苏蒂安，看到“代总统”桂冠，在今年三月，竟被美帝另一走狗苏哈托抢了过去。于是，以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人内部的勾结公开出现了缺口，苏哈托和纳苏蒂安之间的矛盾更加表面化，狗咬狗的丑剧越演越烈。
    三月份以来，以纳苏蒂安为首的右派势力，在疯狂镇压印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民，大肆进行反华活动的同时，拚命打击苏哈托，千方百计地削弱苏哈托的势力。这个老牌右派军阀最近利用右派政党这群饿狗对军人法西斯政权的不满情绪，竟然打起反对“军国主义”、要求实行“民主政治”的旗号，向苏哈托派发动了持续不断的攻击，并为自己上台摇旗呐喊，制造舆论。
    这场争斗主要围绕着所谓“普选”和“贪污走私”等问题而展开的。
    苏哈托一就任“代总统”职务，纳苏蒂安就强调“军权与政权要分开，不能兼而有之”，并迫使苏哈托于四月底放弃了陆军司令的兼职，安插了纳苏蒂安的亲信庞加贝安为陆军代司令。为了进一步攫取总统职位，纳苏蒂安打着“维护一九四五年宪法”的旗号，抨击苏哈托拖延“普选”，并发动由他操纵的御用工具临时人民协商会议和合作国会以及右派学生团体、政党等，纷纷发表声明，举行示威，大造声势，攻击苏哈托反对“议会民主”。六月十二日纳苏蒂安还通过临时人民协商会议发言人苏波洛之口威胁苏哈托：“没有临时人民协商会议的批准，（苏哈托）政府不能推延一九六八年普选”。
    纳苏蒂安还以“反贪污走私”为名，唆使右派学生团体向苏哈托施加压力，要苏哈托逮捕他周围有贪污行为的二十二名亲信军官，并抓住苏哈托军人政权贪污成风、走私猖獗、打家劫舍等等行为，进行攻击。由纳苏蒂安一手培植并得到美国中央情报局资助的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的成员三千余人，五月二十日打着“反贪污”的旗号，乘苏哈托在万隆阅兵的机会冲入现场，举行示威，大吵大闹，使苏哈托处于极为难堪的境地，赶忙下令开枪驱散示威者。
    受美帝宠爱的另一走狗苏哈托，在这场狗打架的争斗中毫不示弱。为了维持和巩固他的统治，苏哈托以“技术上的困难”，“没有钱为预期举行的普选提供费用”为借口，拒绝在一九六八年举行“普选”。他强调，由他控制的武装部队在国会中必须占有百分之二十五的议席。
    苏哈托还把“反贪污”的旗帜接了过来，以毒攻毒，把责任加在纳苏蒂安头上。他搞了一份纳苏蒂安派军官贪污的名单，传讯并从军政部门开除了部分纳苏蒂安派军官和亲信。苏哈托公开指责纳苏蒂安集团“试图在（印度尼西亚）这个国家制造混乱”，并提出“对企图破坏内阁的集团绝不能容忍”的警告。七月，苏哈托向他的嫡系部队陆军战略后备司令部发出“特别指示”，正式下令清除异己。苏哈托毫不掩饰地表示，清除异己是为了避免“被扼死”。安塔拉通讯社把苏哈托的这个决定称为“闪电式的清洗行动”。
    陆军喉舌《武装部队报》五月二十三日在一篇社论中谈到右派集团内部存在的“消极现象”时透露了这场军阀之间贼喊捉贼、群狗打架的丑剧的实质。它说，这不过是“为了集团的利益而吵架”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》一文中谈到蒋介石集团内部狗打架的情形时指出：“……这不过是大狗小狗饱狗饿狗之间的一点特别有趣的争斗，一个不大不小的缺口，一种又痒又痛的矛盾。但是这点争斗，这个缺口，这种矛盾，对于革命的人民却是有用的。”
    印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团内部的这场群狗之间的争斗已经进入公开化的阶段，但更加尖锐的斗争还在前头。以苏哈托和纳苏蒂安为首的两股右派势力，在反共反华反人民方面有着共同的利害，但是他们之间为了反革命的权势而进行的狗咬狗的争斗，是你死我活的、不可调和的。这个反动透顶的军人集团正处在内外交困的境地，而它们之间的争斗，将使它们更加孤立，它们被打倒的日子更早到来。
