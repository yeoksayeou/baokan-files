The Soviet revisionist leading clique has actually taken Khrushchev's recent "conversation" television recording to the United States for screening, allowing Khrushchev to rise from the dead and lavishly praise the head of American imperialism, viciously attack China, and advocate for Soviet-American cooperation. This is a farce of a zombie dancing. Khrushchev has long been a pile of filth despised by humanity. Why do Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like now release him to deceive people?

The reason is that the Soviet revisionist clique has, over the past few years, committed countless acts of counter-revolutionary collusion, betraying the Soviet people and the people of the world. They have increasingly exposed their faces as a bunch of traitors and scoundrels, and their situation has become increasingly dire. Especially after their great betrayal in the Middle East, they have faced strong condemnation from the Soviet people and the people of the world, making their days even harder. Although the Soviet revisionist clique has mobilized all their propaganda machines and all their lackeys, big and small, to desperately defend themselves, they still cannot cover up their traitorous faces or escape their predicament of being besieged both internally and externally. Therefore, they have no choice but to resort to the political zombie of Khrushchev, bringing him out as a lifeline.

The Soviet revisionist clique's great betrayal in the Middle East is a repeat, and a more despicable one, of Khrushchev's great betrayal during the 1962 Caribbean Crisis. They boasted and swore to support the Arab people, but when the critical moment came, they betrayed the Arab people. They even blatantly colluded with American imperialism to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. Khrushchev shamelessly boasted about his "victory" in the Caribbean Crisis, not only to defend himself but also to cover up the betrayal of his successors in this Middle East incident.

When Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like came to power, they wanted people to believe that they were different from Khrushchev. However, from the Caribbean Crisis to the Middle East, from Camp David to Glasnost, they have shown that they have completely inherited Khrushchev's legacy and are even more despicable and filthy than Khrushchev. Now, by letting Khrushchev perform, they further prove that what they are practicing is Khrushchevism without Khrushchev.

However, since Khrushchev has already been driven off the stage of history, how can his zombie dance save Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like from their doomed fate? Khrushchev's zombie dance is merely a gesture from the grave to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like.

    政治僵尸的丑恶表演
    苏修领导集团竟然把赫鲁晓夫最近一次“谈话”的电视纪录片，拿到美国去放映，让赫鲁晓夫借尸还魂，大肆吹捧美帝国主义头子，恶毒攻击中国，宣扬苏美合作，为他的投降叛卖行径进行无耻的辩护。这是一出僵尸跳舞的小丑剧。
    赫鲁晓夫早已成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流现在为什么要把他放出笼来招摇撞骗呢？
    原因就在于，苏修集团几年来干尽了背叛苏联人民和世界人民的反革命勾当，不断暴露出他们这一伙大叛徒、大工贼的面目，处境越来越不妙。特别是他们在中东事件中又一次大叛卖，遭到苏联人民和世界人民的强烈谴责之后，日子更不好混了。苏修集团虽然开动了所有宣传机器，动员了大大小小的娄罗，竭力为自己辩解，也无法掩饰他们的叛徒嘴脸，摆脱不了他们内外交困的窘境。因此，他们只好乞灵于赫鲁晓夫这一具政治僵尸，把他搬出来作为救命草。
    苏修集团在中东事件中的大叛卖，就是赫鲁晓夫在一九六二年加勒比海危机中大叛卖的翻版，而且是更恶劣的翻版。他们大吹牛皮，指天发誓表示支持阿拉伯人民，但是到了紧要关头，就出卖了阿拉伯人民。他们甚至明目张胆地伙同美帝国主义去扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争烈火。赫鲁晓夫无耻地吹嘘他在加勒比海危机中的“胜利”，不仅是为他自己辩护，也正是为他的继承人在这次中东事件中的叛卖行径遮羞。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台的时候，曾经想要人们相信，他们和赫鲁晓夫是有所不同的。但是从加勒比海危机到中东事件，从戴维营到葛拉斯堡罗，处处说明他们完全继承了赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，而且比赫鲁晓夫干的更无耻，更肮脏。现在他们让赫鲁晓夫出场表演，就更加证明他们所实行的是没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义。
    但是，既然赫鲁晓夫已经被赶下历史舞台，他又怎么能够挽救得了勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的灭亡命运呢？赫鲁晓夫的僵尸跳舞，不过是从坟墓里向勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流招手而已。
