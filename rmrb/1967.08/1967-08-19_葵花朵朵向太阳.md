At a time when the people of the entire nation are indignantly denouncing China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and the military, and when the triumphant songs of the great victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao are resounding, a brilliant documentary film recording Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, watching the revolutionary ballet "White-Haired Girl" - "The Red Sun Illuminates the Ballet Stage" - is being shown nationwide! This is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and another brilliant achievement of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art.

When we watched this film with the happiest and most excited hearts, we couldn't help but recall the scene of Chairman Mao personally watching our performance and receiving us on April 24 this year. That night, as the performance was about to begin, the auditorium suddenly lit up with brilliant lights, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the entire auditorium. Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao came! How excited we were! How much we wanted to see Chairman Mao! We rushed to the stage entrance, lifted the curtain, and looked out. Finally, we saw him: Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a spirited demeanor, walked into the auditorium with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and Premier Zhou and others...

After the performance began, each of us threw ourselves wholeheartedly into the ballet. We all had a common wish: Today, our greatest leader and Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin are inspecting our youngest artistic troupe nurtured under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest happiness and honor of our lives! We must perform well and report the best results to Chairman Mao. What an unforgettable night! We performed with the most enthusiasm, the most abundant emotions, the richest feelings, and the most brilliant colors! Because the brilliant light of the red sun in our hearts illuminated the ballet stage, making us see clearly...

After the performance ended, the curtain opened wide. We all saw Chairman Mao. He smiled at us, waved to us, and walked briskly towards us. At that moment, we were the happiest people in the world. We shouted! We jumped! We, like blooming sunflowers, gathered around Chairman Mao; our hearts, red as red, turned towards the red sun in our hearts! We tightly huddled around Chairman Mao, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" thousands and thousands of times!

The brilliance of the red sun has made the ancient ballet art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers in a new form. The brilliance of the red sun has firmly established the image of heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ballet stage. We celebrate the rebirth of ballet art and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art! We shout even more thousands and thousands of times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!"

The revolutionary ballet "White-Haired Girl" was created and performed under the personal care of Comrade Jiang Qing, the brave flag bearer of the proletarian cultural revolution. It broke through the heavy obstacles of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and, with a new appearance, declared to the world: The inverted history has been inverted by us! We have overturned the old ballet that sang the praises of the aristocratic lords, princes, and princesses, and let the masters of history—the heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers—permanently occupy the revolutionary ballet stage.

Of course, the achievements we have made in the ballet revolution are only the beginning, just the first step of a long march. We must always remember Chairman Mao's repeated instructions, maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried style, and maintain a hardworking style. We must never forget class struggle and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must thoroughly criticize and eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. The task before us is arduous, and the road is tortuous. But with the leadership and personal care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we have boundless strength. We will definitely overcome all difficulties and strive for new victories. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, do a good job in the great criticism and great unity. We are determined, together with our comrades-in-arms in the revolutionary literary and artistic circles across the country, to strive for the creation of more and better revolutionary model operas and dedicate our lives to the revolutionary ballet cause!

    葵花朵朵向太阳
    上海市舞蹈学校《白毛女》演出团全体同志
    在全国人民愤怒声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在党内、军内的代理人的时刻，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得一个又一个伟大胜利的凯歌声中，一部记载我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席观看革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的光辉纪录片——《红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台》在全国各地上映了！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的又一辉煌成果。
    当我们怀着最最幸福、最最激动的心情观看这部影片的时候，我们情不自禁地回忆起了今年四月二十四日毛主席他老人家亲自观看我们演出和接见我们的情景。那天晚上，演出快开始了，霎时间，剧场内灯火辉煌，“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！！”的欢呼声响彻整个剧场。我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席来了，我们多么激动啊！我们多么想看到毛主席啊！我们不顾一切地趴在舞台口撩起大幕向外看，我们终于看见了：他老人家红光满面，神采奕奕地和他的亲密战友林副主席以及周总理等一起走进了剧场……。演出开始后，我们每个人都全身心地投入到舞剧中去了。我们大家都有一个共同的心愿：今天，我们最伟大的领袖和林副统帅来检阅咱们这支在毛泽东思想光辉下哺育的最年青的文艺队伍来了，这是我们一生最大的幸福，最大的光荣！我们一定要把戏演好，以最好的成绩来向毛主席汇报。这一难忘的夜晚啊！我们演得最起劲，情绪最饱满，感情最丰富，色彩最绚丽！因为我们心中最红最红的红太阳的伟大光辉照亮了芭蕾舞台，照得我们心明眼亮……。
    演出结束后，大幕敞开了。我们每个人都看到了毛主席。他老人家向我们微笑，向我们招手，向我们健步走来了。此时，我们是世界上最最幸福的人。我们欢呼！我们跳跃！我们象一朵朵初放的葵花簇拥着毛主席；我们颗颗红心向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳！我们紧紧依偎在毛主席的身边，千遍万遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    红太阳的光辉使外来的古老的芭蕾舞艺术以新的姿态为工农兵服务了。红太阳的光辉使英雄的工农兵形象牢牢地树立在芭蕾舞台。我们欢呼芭蕾舞艺术的新生，欢呼毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！我们更千遍万遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！！”
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是在无产阶级文化大革命的英勇旗手江青同志的亲切关怀下创作和演出的。它冲破了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的重重阻挠，以崭新的姿态向全世界宣告：颠倒的历史被我们颠倒过来了！我们革了歌颂贵族老爷、王子公主的旧芭蕾舞的命，让历史的主人——英雄的工农兵永远永远占领革命的芭蕾舞台。
    当然，我们在芭蕾革命方面取得的一点成绩，还仅仅是一个开端，只是万里长征的第一步。我们一定牢记毛主席的谆谆教导，保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们更要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判和肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线的流毒。摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的，道路是曲折的。但是，有毛主席和党中央的领导和亲切关怀，我们就有了无穷的力量，我们就一定能克服一切困难，去争取新的胜利。我们决心遵循毛主席的教导，搞好革命的大批判、大联合。我们决心和全国文艺界无产阶级革命派战友一起，为创造更多更好的革命样板戏而努力，为革命的芭蕾舞事业奋斗终身！
