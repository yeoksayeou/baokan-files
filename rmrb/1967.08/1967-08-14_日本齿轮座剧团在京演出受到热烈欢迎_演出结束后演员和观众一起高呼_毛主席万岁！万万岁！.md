The Japanese revolutionary arts workers' Gear Theater Troupe held its first performance in Beijing tonight and was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo attended the performance. Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Chu Tu-nan delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, enthusiastically praising the Gear Theater Troupe for raising the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism and adhering to Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as their guide.

He said, the comrades of the Gear Theater have, in the course of struggle, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, bravely and resolutely fought against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. In recent years, they have particularly waged a fierce struggle against the handful of revisionist elements in the Japanese Communist Party, and are indeed fighters in the arts who raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight against imperialism and revisionism.

Gear Theater Troupe leader Fujikawa Natsu said, the Gear Theater is able to perform in Beijing, the red fortress of the world revolution, at this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing from victory to victory, and feels greatly honored.

He said: We have made up our minds to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, reform ourselves, and make literature and art a powerful weapon in the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

The play "Wildfire" performed tonight is about the poor peasants in the Chichibu area of Japan who, in their struggle against landlords and capitalists, organized themselves and successfully staged an armed uprising.

This play was created by the comrades of the Gear Theater under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of their fiery struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

After arriving in China, the comrades of the Gear Theater Troupe continued to study Chairman Mao's works, visited and toured rural people's communes, solicited the opinions of revolutionary masses, and made many revisions. When the stage showed the suffering Japanese peasants finally taking up arms and forming a mighty rebel army, the audience was moved by the revolutionary spirit of the Japanese people and the entire hall erupted in enthusiastic applause.

After the performance, the Japanese revolutionary arts warriors and the audience together repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" and together sang "The East Is Red."

    他说，齿轮座的同志们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，勇敢地和美日反动派进行了坚决的斗争。特别是近年来，他们大造日共一小撮修正主义分子的反，不愧为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的反帝、反修的文艺战士。
    齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子在开幕式上说，齿轮座能在中国无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利的时刻，能在世界革命的红色堡垒——北京演出，感到十分光荣。
    他说：我们已经下定决心，遵照毛主席的教导，无条件执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，进行自我改造，使文艺成为日本人民反帝反修斗争的有力武器。
    今晚演出的话剧《野火》，是描写日本秩父地方的贫苦农民，在反对地主和资本家的斗争中组织起来，胜利地举行了武装起义。
    这个剧是齿轮座的同志们在毛泽东思想的指导下，在反对美日反动派的火热斗争中创作的。
    齿轮座剧团同志们来到中国后，又不断学习毛主席著作，并且到农村人民公社参观访问，征求革命群众的意见，作了多次修改。当舞台上出现受苦的日本农民终于拿起武器，组成浩浩荡荡的造反大军时，观众被日本人民的革命造反精神所激动，全场响起热烈的掌声。
    演出结束后，日本革命文艺战士和观众一起不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
