Japanese friends, renowned surgeon Dr. Kashiwagi Masakazu, spoke to Chinese reporters on the first anniversary of the publication of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He emphasized that this document, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, not only ensured the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China but also opened up a bright prospect for the liberation of the world's people and world revolution.

Kashiwagi expressed his deepest feelings, saying, "All revolutionary people around the world wish Chairman Mao eternal health and longevity!"

He said, "The past year has been a great year, a year in which the face of world history has changed rapidly. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, armed revolutionary struggles and armed resistance movements have emerged in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and within the United States. He pointed out that China under the leadership of Mao Zedong is a stronghold of world revolution.

He said, "The 'Sixteen Points' scientifically and accurately pointed out the direction and methods of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The 'Sixteen Points' ensured the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The victory of the Cultural Revolution shows that Chairman Mao most trusts and relies on the masses of the people, and it also shows that the Chinese people most love Chairman Mao.

Kashiwagi stressed that Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, has creatively and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to its contemporary peak. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao has not only solved the problem in theory but also in practice of how the proletariat, after seizing power, can prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

Kashiwagi pointed out that the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries have exposed and thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev, not only uprooting the main culprit of capitalist restoration in China but also delivering a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU, and reactionaries in various countries. They are breathing the same air as China's Khrushchev. That is why they are raging and have launched a frenzied anti-China wave. But this in no way indicates their strength; on the contrary, it only shows their weakness, showing that they are paper tigers.

Kashiwagi praised the heroic deeds of the Chinese Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that the iron fists of the Red Guards not only struck a heavy blow to China's Khrushchev but also dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries around the world.

Kashiwagi strongly condemned the Miyamoto revisionist clique as unadulterated revisionists. They are pushing a line of revisionism that is anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, anti-people, anti-China, and anti-revolution. Kashiwagi pointed out that what the Miyamoto clique opposes is precisely the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, they are most hostile to and most viciously attack contemporary Marxism-Leninism at its peak, Mao Zedong Thought, the great achievements of Chairman Mao in developing Marxism-Leninism, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Kashiwagi said that the Miyamoto clique, which has become a traitor to the revolution, will continue to do more evil and foolish things in the future. But as Chairman Mao has pointed out, they will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet." Like all imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in the world, they will meet a miserable end.

    日本朋友颂扬毛主席创造性地全面地发展了马列主义
    “十六条”保证中国文化大革命取得辉煌胜利
    无产阶级革命派批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫沉重打击了帝修反
    新华社东京七日电　日本朋友、著名外科医生柏木正一，在《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表一周年的时候，向中国记者发表谈话指出，这个由毛主席亲自主持制定的文件不仅保证了中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，而且为世界人民的解放事业、为世界革命展现了胜利的前景。
    柏木怀着最真挚的感情说：“全世界革命人民都敬祝毛主席永远健康，万寿无疆！”
    他说，过去这一年是伟大的一年，是世界历史面貌迅速改观的一年。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和美国国内纷纷出现了武装革命斗争和武装抗暴斗争的大好形势。他指出，毛主席领导下的中国是世界革命的坚强堡垒。
    他说，“十六条”科学地、准确地指出了无产阶级文化大革命的方向和方法。“十六条”保证中国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌的胜利。文化大革命的胜利表明毛主席最相信和最依靠人民群众，同时也表明中国人民最热爱毛主席。
    柏木强调指出，中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖、当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到当代的顶峰。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席不仅在理论上，而且在实践上解决了无产阶级在夺取政权以后怎样防止产生修正主义和怎样防止资本主义复辟的问题。
    柏木指出，中国无产阶级革命派揪出和批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫，这不仅挖出了在中国复辟资本主义的总根子，而且沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派。它们是同中国的赫鲁晓夫一个鼻孔出气的。正因为如此，它们暴跳如雷，掀起了疯狂的反华浪潮。但这丝毫不表明它们的强大，相反，只能表明它们的虚弱，表明它们是纸老虎。
    柏木赞扬中国红卫兵闯将在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的功勋。他说，红卫兵的铁拳不仅狠狠地打击了中国的赫鲁晓夫，而且沉重地打击了全世界的帝修反。
    柏木强烈谴责宫本修正主义集团是不折不扣的修正主义者。它们推行的是一套反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想、反人民、反华、反革命的修正主义路线。柏木指出，宫本集团所反对的正是马克思列宁主义的根本原则，因而，它们也就最仇视和最恶毒地攻击当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，攻击毛主席为发展马克思列宁主义立下的丰功伟绩，攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    柏木说，成为革命叛徒的宫本集团今后将继续做更多的坏事和蠢事。但正象毛主席所指出的那样，他们只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”。他们同世界上一切帝修反一样，必将遭到悲惨的下场。
