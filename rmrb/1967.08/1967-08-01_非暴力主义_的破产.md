In the face of the storm of the American black people's struggle against violence, the Johnson administration completely tore off its "freedom," "democracy" fig leaf, revealing its ferocious and menacing visage. Those dogs specially raised by the American ruling class to sabotage the black people's struggle have thoroughly exposed their shameful faces.

For a long time, the American ruling class has directed and utilized so-called "black leaders" like Martin Luther King to infiltrate the American black movement, advocating so-called "non-violentism." These reactionary lackeys usually play the role of pastors, preaching things like "do not use violence" and "fight with love," putting on a "compassionate" act. However, when Johnson was frightened by the black people's struggle against violence in Detroit and ruthlessly mobilized nearly twenty thousand military police to carry out savage suppression, Martin Luther King and his ilk issued a statement, openly supporting Johnson's government's violent actions against the blacks. This immediately exposed the true face of these so-called "non-violentists." It turns out that they oppose the revolutionary violence of the oppressed, while supporting the counter-revolutionary violence of the oppressors.

Martin Luther King and his ilk not only support the Johnson government's counter-revolutionary violence, but the tune they sing is also exactly the same as Johnson's.

Johnson slanders the black people's just struggle against violence as being "guilty," falsely claiming that "according to the law, this is a crime." Martin Luther King and his ilk also shout that this is an "evil action," that it is "guilty."

Johnson shouts about "maintaining law and order," about "condemning and fighting against all forms of lawlessness." Martin Luther King and his ilk fully support this.

Martin Luther King and his ilk have come out to perform such an act, making it clear to people that these villains are not "black leaders" at all, but are slaves of American monopoly capital, accomplices of the American ruling class in suppressing and massacring blacks.

Chairman Mao said, "The working people have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary ruling class for thousands of years, and it is not easy for them to realize the importance of seizing the gun." Martin Luther King and his ilk advocate "non-violentism," serving the deception and intimidation of the American ruling class, attempting to prevent blacks from taking up arms to rebel against the American ruling class. However, the consciousness of the broad masses of American blacks is increasingly awakening, and they are increasingly understanding that they must use violent resistance to counter violent suppression. This is the inevitable law of class struggle. Whether it is the American ruling class's bloody suppression or Martin Luther King and his ilk's so-called "non-violentism" deception, it cannot stop the black masses from resolutely taking the path of violent struggle, and it will greatly advance the black movement.

### “非暴力主义”的破产

    “非暴力主义”的破产
    在美国黑人抗暴斗争的风暴面前，约翰逊政府完全撕掉了它的“自由”、“民主”的遮羞布，露出了青面獠牙的凶相。而那些被美国统治集团专门豢养来破坏黑人斗争的走狗，也彻底暴露了他们的可耻嘴脸。
    长期以来，美国统治集团就指使和利用所谓“黑人领袖”马丁·路德·金之流，钻到美国黑人运动中，鼓吹所谓“非暴力主义”。这些反动派的走狗，平时扮演着牧师的角色，大讲什么不要使用暴力呀，“要用爱来战斗”呀，装出一副“悲天悯人”的样子。然而，当约翰逊被底特律黑人抗暴斗争吓得慌了手脚，悍然调动近两万名军警去进行野蛮镇压时，马丁·路德·金之流竟发表声明，公然拥护约翰逊政府对黑人的暴力行动。这就一下子拆穿了这些所谓“非暴力主义者”的假面具。原来他们反对的是被压迫者的革命暴力，而拥护的是压迫者的反革命暴力。
    马丁·路德·金之流不仅拥护约翰逊政府的反革命暴力，而且他们所唱的调子也是同约翰逊一模一样的。
    约翰逊诬蔑黑人的抗暴正义斗争是有“罪”的，胡说什么“根据法律，这是罪行”。马丁·路德·金之流也叫嚷说这是“罪恶的行动”，是“有罪的”。
    约翰逊叫嚷要“维持法治和秩序”，要“谴责和同各种形式的无法无天的现象进行斗争”。马丁·路德·金之流对此表示“充分支持”。
    马丁·路德·金之流跳出来做了这样一番表演，使人们可以清楚看到，这些坏家伙根本不是什么“黑人领袖”，而是美国垄断资本的奴仆，是美国统治集团镇压和屠杀黑人的帮凶。
    毛主席说，“劳动人民几千年来上了反动统治阶级的欺骗和恐吓的老当，很不容易觉悟到自己掌握枪杆子的重要性。”马丁·路德·金之流鼓吹“非暴力主义”，就是为美国统治集团的欺骗和恐吓效劳，企图阻止黑人拿起武器来造美国统治集团的反，但是，广大的美国黑人的觉悟正在日益提高，越来越懂得必须用暴力的抵抗来对付暴力的镇压。这是阶级斗争发展的必然规律。不论是美国统治集团的血腥镇压，还是马丁·路德·金之流的所谓“非暴力主义”的欺骗，都阻挡不了黑人群众坚决走上暴力斗争的道路，并且把黑人运动大大推向前进。
