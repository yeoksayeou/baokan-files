The great People's Liberation Army of China is an invincible and undefeatable army unparalleled in the world. The People's Liberation Army, for decades, has persevered through hardships and made great sacrifices, writing the most magnificent poems and achieving the greatest merits for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army has undertaken the glorious and arduous tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army are infinitely loyal to our great leader and great commander-in-chief, Chairman Mao, and infinitely loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do it, demonstrating the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army. In the "three supports and two military controls" work, they have done a great deal of work and achieved tremendous results.

They work together with the broad masses in factories and rural areas, actively implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," exposing the evil plots of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to sabotage production, defending socialist construction, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

They resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, standing shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionaries, loving what they love, hating what they hate, sharing their urgencies, and helping them in their needs. When the proletarian revolutionaries are suppressed and persecuted, the sons and daughters of the people stand up, actively supporting and firmly defending them, uniting with them, fighting with them, and achieving victory with them.

The great achievements of the People's Liberation Army are evident to all revolutionary masses, who praise them highly. The gun is firmly in the hands of such a great revolutionary army, which is a strong backing for the proletarian revolutionaries and the happiness of tens of millions of laboring people.

Chairman Mao said, "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." This is a great truth. In the revolutionary war years, it was the same in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The People's Liberation Army is an important tool of proletarian dictatorship and a pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It is precisely because we have such a powerful revolutionary army that we can, in a country of 700 million people, mobilize the masses, carry out great democracy, and wage a struggle for power against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, defeating the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolution. Due to the extremely complex class struggle, the "three supports and two military controls" tasks are heavy, and there is a lack of experience. Therefore, in some places, individual leaders of the People's Liberation Army may have some shortcomings or mistakes in their support-left work. The experience of any great revolution in history has proven without exception that there will inevitably be some shortcomings or mistakes in a great revolution.

The proletarian revolutionaries should enthusiastically help the People's Liberation Army. They should believe that those among them who have made some mistakes or have shortcomings can quickly correct them. The fact is indeed so. Once they recognize their mistakes, they quickly, sincerely, and resolutely correct them through actual actions, winning the trust and support of the broad revolutionary masses.

The proletarian revolutionaries must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is the great revolutionary army personally created by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. It has always been established according to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and has grown and prospered under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Although the great careerists, great conspirators, and great warlords like Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing who have infiltrated the Party have tried to change the proletarian nature of our army according to the bourgeois military line, their attempts have been firmly resisted and strongly opposed by the broad masses of soldiers and officers. Their plots have not succeeded and will not succeed. The bourgeois military line they have implemented has been struck with devastating blows. What dominates in the People's Liberation Army is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great People's Liberation Army of China, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the reliable pillar for the victory of our country's proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionaries must firmly hold high the banner of supporting the army, correctly treat the People's Liberation Army, cherish the People's Liberation Army, maintain the high prestige of the People's Liberation Army, and sincerely assist the People's Liberation Army in doing a good job in the "three supports and two military controls." We must deeply carry out the great criticism, achieve and consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    伟大的中国人民解放军是我国无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命的可靠支柱
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十四期社论
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是攻无不克，战无不胜的举世无双的英雄军队。人民解放军，几十年如一日，艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，为中国人民和世界人民的革命事业，写下了最壮丽的诗篇，立下了最伟大的功勋。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军担负了支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣而又艰巨的任务。解放军广大指战员无限忠心于我们伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅——毛主席，无限忠心于伟大的毛泽东思想。毛主席怎么说，就怎么做，表现了人民解放军的高贵品质。在“三支”、“两军”工作中，他们做了大量的工作，取得了极其巨大的成绩。
    他们和广大群众在一起，在工厂、在农村，积极贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，揭穿了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏生产的罪恶阴谋，保卫了社会主义建设，推动了工农业生产的发展。
    他们坚决响应毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的号召，同无产阶级革命派心连心、肩并肩，爱革命派之所爱，恨革命派之所恨，急革命派之所急，帮革命派之所需。在无产阶级革命派受压制、遭迫害的时候，人民子弟兵挺身而出，积极地支持他们，坚决地保卫他们，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    中国人民解放军所立下的丰功伟绩，广大革命群众，有目共睹，有口皆碑。枪杆子牢牢地掌握在这样一支伟大的革命军队手中，这是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，这是千百万劳动人民的幸福。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是一个伟大的真理。在革命战争年代里是这样，在无产阶级文化大革命中也是这样。人民解放军是无产阶级专政的重要工具，是无产阶级文化大革命的擎天柱。
  正因为有这样一支强大的革命军队，我们才能够在七亿人口的中国，放手发动群众，开展大民主，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展夺权斗争，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场史无前例的大革命。由于阶级斗争极其错综复杂，“三支”、“两军”任务繁重，缺乏经验，因此，有些地方人民解放军的个别负责人，在支左工作过程中难免会有一些缺点或错误。历史上任何大革命的经验：都无例外地证明了大革命中难免会有这样或那样的缺点或错误。
    无产阶级革命派应该热情地帮助人民解放军。应该相信他们中间某些犯有缺点或错误的干部，是能够很快改正的。事实正是如此。他们一旦认识了自己的错误，就以很快的速度、很诚恳的态度、很大的决心，向群众公开检讨，以实际行动坚决改正，赢得了广大革命群众的信任和拥护。
    无产阶级革命派要牢牢记住毛主席的伟大教导：相信和依靠人民解放军。人民解放军是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接指挥的伟大的革命军队。她从诞生以来，一直是按照毛主席的无产阶级建军路线建立起来的，是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长壮大的。尽管钻进党内的大野心家、大阴谋家、大军阀彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，力图按照资产阶级军事路线来改变我军的无产阶级性质；但是他们的企图受到了广大指战员的坚决抵制和强烈反对。他们的阴谋没有得逞，也不会得逞。他们所实行的资产阶级军事路线遭到了毁灭性的打击。在人民解放军中占统治地位的，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大的中国人民解放军，是我国无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的可靠支柱。无产阶级革命派必须高举拥军的旗帜，正确地对待人民解放军，爱护人民解放军，维护人民解放军的崇高威望，真诚地从各方面协助人民解放军做好“三支”、“两军”的工作。我们要深入地开展革命的大批判，实现和巩固革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
