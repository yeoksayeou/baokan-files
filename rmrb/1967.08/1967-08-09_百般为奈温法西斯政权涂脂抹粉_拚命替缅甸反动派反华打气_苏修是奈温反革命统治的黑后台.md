	The Soviet revisionists have been busy painting the Naywin fascist regime in rosy colors and vigorously supporting the Myanmar reactionaries in their anti-China campaign. They are the black backers of the Naywin counter-revolutionary rule.

	As the Naywin government in Myanmar is further intensifying its frenzied anti-China activities and ruthlessly suppressing the Myanmar people, thereby exposing its reactionary nature, the Soviet revisionist leadership has openly and eagerly stepped forward to beautify this bunch of reactionary militarists. They praise the so-called "socialism" that the Naywin clique is pushing in Myanmar and use the opportunity to fiercely attack China. An article published in the Soviet revisionists' mouthpiece *Izvestia* on August 4 is a typical example of this.

	In this article, the Soviet revisionists spare no effort to sing the praises of the Naywin clique, which, under the banner of so-called "socialism," has been deceiving the people and representing the interests of the Myanmar landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. They deliberately avoid mentioning that since the Naywin clique came to power in 1962, it has been pursuing a policy of betraying the country, dictatorship, anti-communism, and suppression of the people, which has led to serious national disasters and economic crises. Instead, they fabricate lies about how the Naywin clique, after coming to power, "drove out foreign capital from Myanmar" and carried out "democratic reforms" in society according to the so-called "program" of "Myanmar's road to socialism." They also boast about the "achievements" of the Naywin clique in the economic and cultural fields. They even propagate that the past five years were a period of "leap-forward" for Myanmar, and so on. Moreover, the Soviet revisionists do not mention at all that the broad masses of the Myanmar people, under the leadership of the Myanmar Communist Party, are further uniting and waging armed revolutionary struggles against the Naywin clique's reactionary rule. Instead, they talk endlessly about how the "broad strata of residents" all support the government.

	This is nothing but a pack of lies to deceive world public opinion.

	In the article, the Soviet revisionists maliciously slander the principled stance of socialist China toward Myanmar and spare no effort to cover up the fascist atrocities against China deliberately fabricated by the Naywin government for its domestic and foreign policy needs. They confuse right and wrong, shamelessly shifting the responsibility for these anti-China atrocities onto the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar. They also slander the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar, who are fighting to defend their legitimate rights and resist the persecution by the Naywin government, as engaging in "sabotage activities" against Myanmar, and so on.

	In the article, the Soviet revisionists once again openly admit that they are "reliable friends" of the Naywin military fascist dictatorship, have "good feelings" toward this regime, and provide it with "sincere and selfless aid." This further shows that the Soviet revisionist clique and the Naywin clique are birds of a feather. They are completely in agreement in their anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary stances.

	However, no matter how the Soviet revisionists collude with U.S. imperialism to support and praise the Naywin government in Myanmar, they will never be able to save the Naywin clique's tottering reactionary rule. They will also not be able to escape their own doom.

    百般为奈温法西斯政权涂脂抹粉　拚命替缅甸反动派反华打气
    苏修是奈温反革命统治的黑后台
    新华社八日讯　正当缅甸奈温政府进一步疯狂反华，加紧镇压缅甸人民，从而赤裸裸地暴露出它的反动面目的时候，苏修领导集团公然迫不及待地一再出面美化这一伙反动军阀，吹捧他们在缅甸推行的所谓“社会主义”，并乘机大肆反对中国。苏修集团的喉舌《消息报》八月四日发表的一篇文章，就是这方面的一个活“标本”。
    苏修集团在这篇文章中，拚命为打着所谓“社会主义”招牌进行招摇撞骗、代表着缅甸地主阶级和官僚资产阶级利益的奈温法西斯政权歌“功”颂“德”。他们极力回避奈温集团自一九六二年上台以来，一直奉行卖国、独裁、反共、反人民的政策，引起了严重的民族灾难，造成了严重的经济危机；居然胡诌什么奈温集团当政以后，“从缅甸清除了外国资本”，根据所谓“缅甸通向社会主义之路”的“纲领”，对社会进行“民主改革”，并且大肆宣扬奈温集团在经济、文化方面所取得的“成就”。他们甚至宣传过去的五年是什么缅甸“飞跃的年代”，等等。不仅如此，苏修还闭口不谈广大的缅甸人民在缅甸共产党的领导下，正在进一步团结起来，进行反对奈温集团反动统治的革命的武装斗争，却大谈特谈什么“广大的居民阶层”“都支持政府”。
    这完全是愚弄世界舆论的一派胡言。
    苏修在这篇文章中大肆诽谤社会主义中国对缅甸的原则立场，千方百计地为奈温政府出于自己内政外交的需要而蓄意制造的反华排华的法西斯暴行打掩护。他们混淆是非，硬把挑起这些反华暴行的责任推到中国驻缅甸大使馆的身上，并且污蔑在缅甸的广大爱国华侨为维护自己的正当权益、反对奈温政府的迫害而进行的正义斗争，是什么对缅甸的“破坏活动”，等等。
    苏修在文章中还再一次直言不讳地供认，他们是奈温军事法西斯独裁政权的“可靠的朋友”，对这个政权“抱有好感”，并且给予它“真诚无私的援助”。这就进一步表明，苏修集团和奈温集团，不过是一丘之貉。他们在反共、反华、反人民、反革命方面是完全一致的。
    但是，不管苏修如何同美帝串通一气，极力支持和吹捧缅甸奈温政府，他们绝对不能挽救奈温集团摇摇欲坠的反动统治，也逃避不了他们自己的彻底灭亡的命运。
