African friends at our embassy's Army Day reception expressed their unlimited love for Chairman Mao. The mighty power of Chairman Mao's people's war thought is boundless. Friends eagerly sought Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Lin Biao's works.

	New China News Agency, August 3rd: The Chinese embassies in Somalia, Morocco, Tunisia, and the consulate in Zanzibar held receptions to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	At these receptions, African friends expressed their love and admiration for Chairman Mao, the great leader who personally created the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life.

	Somali Minister of Cabinet Affairs Hirave, representing Prime Minister Egal, attended the reception hosted by the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Somalia, Zheng Peitang. He extended warm congratulations on the great festival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Among the more than 300 guests at the reception were former Somali President Osman, former Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the ruling party Somali Youth League Hussein, Vice Chairman of the National Assembly Ruble, Police Force Commander Musa, and other high-ranking military and political officials, as well as people from various circles.

	Many Somali friends conveyed their wishes for Chairman Mao's eternal life through the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires. One friend said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the most outstanding leader of our time. He led the Chinese people to achieve such great successes in such a short period. Mao Zedong Thought has spread all over the world, which greatly inspires us." "I was born in the era of Mao Zedong, which is very fortunate." He pointed to a photo of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai sitting on the ground at Tiananmen Square talking with revolutionary masses: "The great leader Chairman Mao is always with the people."

	A freedom fighter from the Somali coast said that the people of the Somali coast are determined to implement Chairman Mao's military line to deal with the French imperialism ruling their country. He said, "Following Chairman Mao's teachings, as long as there is imperialism and reactionaries in the world, we must never relax our vigilance. Imperialism is like dust; if you don't sweep it, it won't go away by itself. Imperialism, if you don't fight it, it won't fall."

	At the reception, Somali friends eagerly sought and read Chairman Mao's works. A female soldier took a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," saying, "Chairman Mao's book is a treasure for all people in the world. I will read Chairman Mao's book carefully."
