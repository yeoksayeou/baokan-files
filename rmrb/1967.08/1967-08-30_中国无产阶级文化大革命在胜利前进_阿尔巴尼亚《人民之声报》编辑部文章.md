The 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held in Beijing and presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong, has been successfully concluded for a year. The resolutions adopted at this plenary session, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, marked a historic turning point in the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, providing a new and powerful impetus to the revolutionary tide of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards. Under the leadership of the Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the hundreds of millions of people of great China have stood up and, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly smashed and overthrown the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements of the bourgeois headquarters and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who hold power, ensuring that the Party and the state do not change color, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and securing the victory of socialism.

Over the past year, through great class struggles, the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have swept across the entire country. The political and ideological positions of the proletariat have been strengthened, the positions of the enemies of the Chinese people and socialism have been destroyed, the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat has been greatly strengthened, and new victories have been achieved in socialist economy, industry, agriculture, culture, and national defense. Over the past year, the counter-revolutionary faces of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have been further exposed to the broad masses of the people, the revisionist elements have been thoroughly exposed, the reactionary fortresses occupied and used by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements have been one by one captured and seized by the proletariat, and those who conspired to promote revisionism and restore capitalism in China, the traitors, agents of the bourgeoisie, conspirators, enemies within the Party and government of socialist China, and the lackeys of Khrushchev in China, such as Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, and Peng Dehuai, have been isolated and exposed.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The revolutionary masses are, on the basis of strengthening the great alliance of the revolutionary masses and the three-in-one combination, carrying out the struggle to seize power throughout the country and thoroughly smash the positions of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements and these class enemies.

Every day, news comes from China about the establishment of revolutionary committees as temporary power organs in other regions. Yesterday, our newspaper reported on the news of the seizure of power by the revolutionary organizations in Qinghai Province, northwestern China. This is another great victory for the revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Party and the people of China.

Comrade Lin Biao's call to the entire army to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought and to achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution is further promoting the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The victorious advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a fatal blow to the internal and external enemies of the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the working class, the laboring peasants, the soldiers, the brave Red Guards, and the hundreds of millions of people of China are much stronger than the reactionaries, the bourgeois elements, and the revisionist elements. Not only has the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution been strongly supported throughout China, proving this point, but the new victories achieved on all production fronts, the great achievements in industry and agriculture, the good economic situation, the good labor discipline and order, the revolutionary optimism and enthusiasm of the urban and rural masses, and the brilliant achievements in all fields of socialist construction in China have also proven this point. Not only have the high targets in the development of productive forces and the overfulfillment of industrial and agricultural production plans clearly shown this, but the successful conduct of three nuclear tests in just one year of carrying out the Cultural Revolution has also clearly shown this.

Over the past year, productive forces have developed unprecedentedly. After successfully completing the spring sowing, agriculture has achieved the highest yield. All industrial production targets have been overfulfilled, far exceeding previous levels. Especially in the production of products serving agriculture, such as fertilizers and agricultural machinery, the growth rate is the highest (from 40% to 220%). This year, in basic industries such as steel, electricity, oil, coal, precision instruments, and machinery, as well as in processing industries, production has also increased tremendously. In Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, and other industrial regions of China, tens of thousands of factories have completed their production plans ahead of schedule in terms of quantity and quality. Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" has been accepted and enthusiastically supported by the hundreds of millions of people of China, becoming a great mobilizing force.

The proletarian revolutionary line of Mao Zedong is achieving victories on all fronts. However, the reactionary enemies, bourgeois elements, and revisionist elements are unwilling to accept their defeat and will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage or lay down their arms. They continue to conspire in every possible way to promote revisionism and capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration in China. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are vigilant against the shameless conspiracies and cunning tricks of the class enemies. They always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the end. Even after the country is pacified, they will continue to engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance."

The tumultuous development of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries panic-stricken. They see their prophecies and propaganda about the "obstruction," "slowdown," "halt," and "failure" of the Chinese Cultural Revolution completely bankrupt, and thus they are even more enraged. The clamor of anti-China propaganda by imperialism and revisionism is not accidental. It reflects the extreme fear of the imperialists, revisionists, and world reactionaries towards the victorious advancement of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The victorious advancement of the Cultural Revolution, the establishment of revolutionary power organs on the basis of the three-in-one combination, and the great alliance of workers, peasants, soldiers, and students under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Chairman Mao's red banner of Marxism-Leninism have finally shattered the beautiful dreams of imperialism and revisionism. These imperialists and revisionists are attempting to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat and make China repeat the events that occurred in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other socialist countries. All this shows that after the fierce struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the reactionary revisionist line of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist proletarian revolutionary line has triumphed over the counter-revolutionary revisionist restoration current.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is burning and sweeping away the reactionary forces, eliminating the danger of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China, and annihilating the allies of the Khrushchev revisionists in the people's China. This is why the Soviet revisionist leadership has gone mad in launching a full-scale anti-China campaign and has become the number one factory for creating anti-China People's Republic of China and anti-Chinese Communist Party, anti-revolution, and anti-socialism propaganda for imperialism and international reactionaries.

The Khrushchev revisionist leaders, Brezhnev and Kosygin, in collusion with imperialism and reactionaries, openly shelter the Chinese bourgeois revisionist reactionaries. Especially recently, they have intensified their anti-China movement, maliciously cursing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. On the one hand, they are engaged in unprecedented anti-China provocations and evil conspiracies, and on the other hand, they openly shelter the Khrushchev revisionist black gang in China, shouting about "trampling on democracy and trampling on human rights." No, in China, there is no, and there will never be, "democracy" for landlords, capitalists, fascists, revisionists, and various dregs of Chinese society—the friends and allies of imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism. China is currently implementing true democracy, implementing the broad democracy of the hundreds of millions of people rising up to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only with the revolutionary fire of this broom can the enemies of socialism in society be eliminated, and the dictatorship of the proletariat be strengthened. The dictatorship of the proletariat implements democracy for the broad laboring masses and gives an iron fist to the enemies of the people and socialism.

The imperialists of the United States, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries will never be able to stop the victorious advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, will never be able to stop the victory of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary thought, and will never be able to destroy the dictatorship of the proletariat in this great socialist country. The victorious advancement of this revolution inspires and encourages the hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe to struggle for national and social liberation, against imperialism and reactionaries, and against their shameful product, modern revisionism.

The Soviet Union and other revisionist ruling cliques are making their countries go further and further down the road of bourgeois degeneration and capitalist restoration. They are increasingly tightening their collusion with imperialism and reactionaries, betraying the revolutionary and socialist cause. The revisionist leaders have not only degenerated into dangerous splitters and saboteurs of the communist movement but also into dangerous splitters and saboteurs of the great cause of national liberation and independence of the peoples of various countries. This thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary betrayal policy cannot but arouse the hatred and opposition of the broad laboring masses in these countries to the revisionist line. Under these circumstances, the example of the Chinese Cultural Revolution still points out to all revolutionaries and people in the countries ruled by revisionists the correct way to successfully oppose and overthrow the traitor cliques that have usurped the leadership of the Party and the state today.

Today, China has become a world power and a decisive factor in solving all international problems. On June 17, China successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb, once again striking at the nuclear monopoly of the imperialists and revisionists and their evil plan to push humanity into their nuclear hegemony trap, and bringing new hope and great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and colonialist violence.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with new strength, reaffirms its support for the brotherly peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. In the course of carrying out this revolution, it has strengthened its active support for the heroic Vietnamese people who are engaged in an epic struggle against imperialist occupiers, to liberate the south, defend the north, and unite the country. The Chinese people are fully implementing the principle of proletarian internationalist unity without reservation. The Chinese people are a strong rear guard for Vietnam, ready to aid Vietnam at any time. The example of China and its fearless and dauntless spirit shown in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism and in the construction of a new socialist society are inspiring the people of the world.

Today, the Indian reactionaries and the fascists of Indonesia, as well as the representatives of the reactionary bourgeoisie and traitors of the people in Burma, "Malaysia," Japan, the Philippines, and other places, have gathered around the Johnson, Brezhnev, and Kosygin clique to join the anti-China chorus. This is not accidental. These scoundrels are trying to establish a "holy alliance" against the people's China and build an anti-China "fire network." The ultimate goal of Kosygin's talks with Johnson in Glasburg is Soviet-American cooperation, further coordination of political, ideological, and military measures by imperialism and revisionism to contain and eliminate China. However, the Chinese giant has a strong human force and immense political, economic, and military potential, and has become an indestructible fortress. In its face, the evil plans of the United States and the Soviet Union to dominate the world and enslave the peoples of various countries will be thoroughly bankrupt. Under these circumstances, the attitude towards defending Marxism-Leninism, opposing revisionism, defending the freedom of the peoples of various countries, and opposing imperialism and reactionaries has become a touchstone for every communist, every revolutionary, every honest person, and the peoples and countries of the world. Comrade Enver Hoxha said at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, "Today, supporting the People's China, defending it from the aggression of the imperialists and their revisionist lackeys, is the historic task and a matter of life and death for all revolutionary and freedom-loving forces and peoples."

The people of Albania, the Party of Labor of Albania, have stood and will stand with the brotherly people of China, the unshakable fortress of Marxism-Leninism and world communism, and wholeheartedly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is of great historical significance not only for the socialist destiny of China but also for the socialist and revolutionary destiny of the world.

    中国无产阶级文化大革命在胜利前进
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八月十六日发表题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命在胜利前进》的编辑部文章，全文如下：
    中国共产党八届十一中全会在北京胜利闭幕已经一年了。在毛泽东同志主持下举行的这次全会的决议，是中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利开展的历史转折点，给了亿万工、农、兵和红卫兵的革命浪潮以新的有力的推动。伟大人民中国的亿万群众在以毛泽东同志为首的党的指引下，已经站起来了，从政治上、思想上和理论上彻底粉碎和推翻资产阶级司令部反革命修正主义分子以及党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使中国的党和国家不改变颜色，巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义胜利。
    一年来，经过巨大的阶级政治搏斗，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火燃遍了全中国，无产阶级的政治思想阵地加强了，中国人民和社会主义的敌人的阵地被摧毁了，无产阶级专政的制度大大加强了，社会主义经济、工业、农业、文化和国防取得了新的胜利。一年来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命嘴脸，进一步在广大人民群众面前暴露了，修正主义分子彻底被揭露了，反革命修正主义分子所盘踞并进行活动的反动堡垒，被无产阶级一个接一个地攻破和夺取了，那些在中国阴谋搞修正主义和复辟资本主义的修正主义分子、投降分子、资产阶级代理人、阴谋家、社会主义中国的党和政府中的敌人、中国的赫鲁晓夫的走卒彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、彭德怀等人被孤立和揪出来了。
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入一个新阶段。无产阶级革命派在加强无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命三结合的基础上正在全中国胜利进行夺权和彻底粉碎反革命修正主义分子以及这些阶级敌人的阵地的斗争。
    每天从中国传来其他地区成立临时权力机构革命委员会的消息。昨天我们报纸上刊登了关于中国西北地区青海省革命组织夺权的消息。这是中国党和人民的领袖毛泽东同志的革命路线的又一重大胜利。
    林彪同志向全军指战员发出的高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在文化大革命运动中立新功的号召进一步推动着无产阶级文化大革命的发展。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展是对中国人民的内外敌人的致命打击。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，无产阶级革命派，工人阶级，劳动农民，军人，英勇的红卫兵，中国亿万群众，要比反动分子，资产阶级分子和修正主义分子强大得多。不仅无产阶级文化大革命在全中国得到有力支持证明了这一点，各条生产战线上取得的新胜利，工农业的巨大成就，良好的经济状况，良好的劳动秩序和纪律，城乡群众的革命乐观主义和热情，中国在社会主义建设各个领域内的辉煌战果都证明了这一点。不但在发展生产力和超额完成工农业生产计划方面的高指标清楚地说明了这一点，而且仅仅在开展文化大革命的一年内就成功地进行了三次核试验也清楚地说明了这一点。
    一年来生产力有了空前的发展。在胜利地结束了春播以后，农业获得了最高产量。工业生产的全部指标超额完成，比过去大大增长。特别是在生产为农业服务的产品，如化肥、农业机械方面，增长率最高（从百分之四十到百分之二百二十）。今年在基础工业如钢铁、电力、石油、煤、精密仪器和机械，以及加工工业等方面，生产也有了十分巨大的增长。北京、上海、南京、广州、武汉、沈阳和中国其他工业地区的成千上万个工厂的工人按质按量地提前完成了生产计划。毛泽东主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召已为中国亿万群众所接受和热烈拥护，并变成了巨大的动员力量。
    毛泽东的无产阶级革命路线正在各条战线上取得胜利。但是反动的敌人、资产阶级分子和修正主义分子不甘心于自己的失败，不会自愿退出历史舞台，不会放下武器。他们继续千方百计地阴谋在中国搞修正主义和资本主义反革命复辟。亿万革命群众正警惕着阶级敌人的无耻阴谋和狡猾伎俩。他们始终牢记毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    中国文化革命轰轰烈烈的开展使帝国主义者，修正主义者和各国反动派惊惶失措，他们看到自己关于什么“中国文化革命受阻，缓慢、停止和失败”的预言和宣传彻底破产，因而更加暴跳如雷。帝国主义、修正主义反华宣传的叫嚣并不是偶然的。它反映了帝国主义者、修正主义者和世界反动派对中国文化革命胜利开展十分恐惧的心理。文化革命胜利进展，在三结合基础上建立革命的政权机构，以及工、农、兵和学生在中国共产党的领导下，在毛泽东主席的马列主义思想红旗的指引下实行大联合，最终地粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的美梦。这些帝国主义者和修正主义者企图破坏无产阶级专政，使中国重演在苏联、南斯拉夫和其他一些社会主义国家发生的事件。所有这一切表明，经过以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级修正主义反动路线这两条路线的激烈斗争，毛主席的马列主义的无产阶级革命路线战胜了反革命修正主义复辟的逆流。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利地焚烧和清扫反动势力，根除在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的危险，消灭赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在人民中国的同盟者。这就是为什么苏修领导疯狂地掀起全面的反华，并成了为帝国主义和国际反动派制造反对中华人民共和国及中国共产党，反对革命和社会主义宣传的头号工厂的原因。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义头目勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，同帝国主义和反动派同流合污，公开庇护中国的资产阶级修正主义反动分子。特别在最近，他们加紧反华运动，恶毒咒骂中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们一面进行罕见的反华挑衅和罪恶阴谋活动，一面公开庇护中国的赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑帮，叫嚷什么“践踏民主和摧残人权”。不，在中国，没有，也永远不会有地主、资本家、法西斯分子、修正主义分子、中国社会的各种渣滓——帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的朋友和同盟者的“民主”。中国目前正在实行真正的民主，实行亿万群众起来进行无产阶级文化大革命的广泛的民主。只有用革命的烈火这把扫帚才能清除社会上的社会主义敌人，才能加强无产阶级专政。无产阶级专政对广大劳动群众实行民主，对人民和社会主义的敌人给予铁拳。
    美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者和各国反动派永远也阻挡不住中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进，永远也阻挡不住毛泽东的马列主义的革命思想的胜利，永远也破坏不了在这个伟大社会主义国家的无产阶级专政。这场革命的胜利开展激励和鼓舞着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲各大洲的亿万人民为争取民族和社会解放，反对帝国主义和反动派及其可耻的产物现代修正主义而进行斗争。
    苏联和其他修正主义统治集团正使他们的国家在资产阶级蜕化变质和资本主义复辟的道路上越走越远。他们越来越加紧同帝国主义和反动派的勾结，背叛革命和社会主义事业。修正主义头头们不仅堕落成为共产主义运动的危险的分裂者和破坏者，而且堕落成为各国人民民族解放和独立伟大事业的危险的分裂者和破坏者。这种彻头彻尾的反革命背叛政策不能不引起这些国家的广大劳动群众对修正主义路线的仇恨和反对。在这种情况下，中国文化革命的榜样还向那些修正主义者当政的国家的所有革命者和人民指出了怎样才能成功地反对和推翻今天篡夺了党和国家领导权的叛徒集团的正确道路。
    今天中国成了世界强国，是解决一切国际问题的决定性因素。中国于六月十七日成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹，又一次打击了帝国主义者和修正主义者的核垄断及其把人类推入他们的核霸权陷阱的罪恶计划，而给世界各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义暴力的斗争带来了新的希望和巨大的鼓舞。
    无产阶级文化大革命以新的力量重申支持正在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的亚、非、拉各国兄弟人民。在开展这场革命的过程中，加强了对为反对帝国主义占领者，解放南方、保卫北方，统一祖国而进行传奇式斗争的英雄越南人民的积极支持。中国人民毫无保留地履行无产阶级国际主义团结的原则。中国人民是越南的强大后方，随时准备援助越南。中国的榜样及其在反对帝国主义和修正主义，建设社会主义新社会的斗争中所表现的勇敢的无畏精神正在鼓舞着全世界人民。
    今天印度反动派和印尼法西斯分子以及缅甸、“马来西亚”、日本、菲律宾等各地反动资产阶级的代表和人民的叛徒纠集在约翰逊、勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团周围，参加反华大合唱，这不是偶然的。这些家伙企图建立反对人民中国的“神圣同盟”，建立反华“火力网”。柯西金同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗会谈的最终目的就是苏美合作，就是帝国主义修正主义进一步协调政治、思想和军事措施，以遏制和消灭中国。但是中国巨人有着雄厚的人力和巨大的政治、经济和军事潜力，已经成了一座不可摧毁的堡垒。在它面前，美苏主宰世界和奴役各国人民的罪恶计划将遭到彻底破产。在这种情况下，对待保卫马列主义、反对修正主义，保卫各国人民的自由、反对帝国主义和反动派的社会主义中国的态度就成了对每个共产党人、每个革命者、每个正直的人以及世界人民和世界各国的试金石。霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上说，“今天，支持人民中国、保卫她免受帝国主义者及其走狗修正主义者的侵犯，是一切革命的和爱好自由的力量和人民的历史性任务和生死攸关的问题。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党过去和现在都同马列主义和世界共产主义坚不可摧的堡垒——兄弟中国人民站在一起，并衷心支持无产阶级文化大革命，这一革命不仅对中国的社会主义命运，而且对全世界的社会主义和革命命运具有重要的历史意义。
