Today, we are in a new era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The hearts of revolutionary people all over the world are with China, with the great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao. Hundreds of millions of people are learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, determined to follow the path of the Chinese revolution. This has become an irresistible historical trend.

All the revolutionary people of the world are comrades and friends of the Chinese people. Our friends are everywhere in the world.

The more the Chinese people gain the support of the world's revolutionary people, the more they will face the ferocious opposition of counter-revolutionary forces. These counter-revolutionary forces blow up anti-China storms in one country and stir up anti-China waves in another. They seem formidable and make a lot of noise for a while. In reality, they are just a few flies bumping into a wall. They buzz and wail a few times, then sob a few times.

Who are these anti-China elements, and how many are there? Counting them up, there are only three groups: one is the imperialists led by the United States, one is the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique, and one is the reactionaries of various countries. All kinds of anti-China "heroes" can be summarized into these three groups. These three types of people, among the world's three billion population, account for only a few percent, say five percent, at most not more than ten percent. The truly anti-China people are just this small handful. They are a small handful in the world, and they are also a small handful in any one country.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, in the countries where they hold power, can use their entire propaganda machinery to slander and attack China, can incite a group of thugs to commit anti-China atrocities, and stage various anti-China farces to create some noise. However, they cannot change the fact that only a small handful are anti-China.

This small handful of counter-revolutionary forces are in an antagonistic position with the people of their own countries and the people of the world. They exploit the people, oppress the people, and hate the people. They are most afraid of the people rising up in revolution. They fiercely oppose the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely oppose the Chinese people who thoroughly implement the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary line, and fiercely oppose the Chinese people who resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. This is not surprising. If they were not anti-China but pro-China, praising us and speaking well of us, where would that place us? Would we not become betrayers of Marxism-Leninism, betrayers of the people, and become revisionists who collude with the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries?

In the world, those who oppose us are a small handful, while those who support us are the majority. The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other progressive elements in various countries, all oppressed peoples and nations, and all revolutionaries fighting against imperialism and its lackeys, are of one heart with the Chinese people and stand with us.

Even in places where anti-China sentiment is rampant, the reactionaries' bayonets and prisons cannot stop the broad masses of people from expressing their love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their longing for China in various ways.

Under the brutal rule of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union, the voices of the laboring people have been heard: "Mao Zedong is our Lenin!"

In the Indian prison, imprisoned revolutionaries wrote to the Chinese people with bloodstained clothes, longing for a copy of Chairman Mao's works.

In Jakarta, tens of thousands of Indonesian people participated in the funeral procession for patriotic Chinese compatriots who were massacred by the Indonesian reactionaries.

Just as the Ne Win clique was stirring up a frenzied anti-China wave, many places in Burma held marches in support of China.

Things are always like this: the more imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries curse us, the more people there are who support China, the greater the revolutionary influence of China, and the more widely the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spread throughout the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The truth of Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than ninety percent of the world's people are on our side. Our friends are everywhere in the world. We are not afraid of being isolated, and we will never be isolated. We are invincible."

The truly isolated ones are the small handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. They are enemies of the people of the world, doing evil deeds, and have long been surrounded by the people of the world. The lifespan of this small handful of harmful insects is not long. Their wailing cries are being drowned out by the rumbling wheels of history. All the anti-China "heroes" will surely be hanged by the revolutionary people of the world!

    我们的朋友遍天下
    本报评论员
    今天，我们正处在以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。全世界革命人民的心向着中国，向着伟大的革命领袖毛主席。亿万人民学习和运用毛泽东思想，决心走中国革命的道路，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    全世界的革命人民都是中国人民的战友，我们的同志和朋友遍天下。
    中国人民越是得到世界革命人民的拥护，就越要遭到反革命势力的疯狂反对。这些反革命势力，一会儿在这个国家吹起一阵反华妖风，一会儿在那个国家掀起一股反华黑浪。看上去其势汹汹，喧嚣一时。其实不过是：小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。
    反华的究竟是些什么人，究竟有多少人呢？数来数去，无非就是那么三家：一家是以美国为首的帝国主义，一家是以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，一家是各国反动派。形形色色的反华“英雄”，归纳起来，都属于这三家。这三类人，在全世界三十亿人口中，不过只占百分之几，例如说百分之五吧，最多也超不过百分之十。真正反华的人，就是这么一小撮。他们在全世界是一小撮，在一个国家里也是一小撮。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派，在他们掌握了政权的国家里，尽管可以开动全套宣传机器，大肆诬蔑和攻击中国，尽管可以指使一伙暴徒制造反华暴行，导演这样或那样的反华丑剧，企图造成一点声势，然而终究无法改变这个事实：反华的只是一小撮。
    这一小撮反革命势力，同他们本国人民和全世界人民处于敌对地位。他们剥削人民，压迫人民，敌视人民，最害怕人民起来革命。他们疯狂地反对以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，疯狂地反对实行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想彻底革命路线的中国人民，疯狂地反对坚决支持世界各国人民革命斗争的中国人民，这是毫不奇怪的。如果他们不是反华，而是拥华、亲华，称赞我们，给我们讲好话，那将置我们于何地呢？我们岂不成了背叛马克思列宁主义、背叛人民的修正主义者吗？岂不是同美帝、苏修和各国反动派同流合污了吗？
    世界上，反对我们的是一小撮，拥护我们的则是大多数。各国的广大工人、农民、革命的知识分子和其他进步人士，一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，所有为反对帝国主义及其走狗而战斗的革命者，都同中国人民是一条心的，都是同我们站在一起的。
    即使在那些猖狂反华的地方，反动派的刺刀和监狱，也阻止不了广大人民通过各种方式表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，对中国的向往。
    在修正主义横暴统治下的苏联，传出了劳动人民动人的心声：“毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”
    在印度的死牢中，被囚禁的革命者用血迹斑斑的衣角给中国人民写信，渴望得到一部毛主席著作。
    在雅加达，成千成万的印尼人民，参加了给牺牲于印尼反动派屠刀之下的爱国华侨送葬的行列。
    正当奈温集团掀起猖狂的反华浪潮的时候，缅甸的许多地方举行了支持中国的游行。
    事情总是这样“怪”，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派骂我们骂得越凶，拥护中国的人就越多，中国的革命影响就越大，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界的传播就越广泛。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。我们是不可战胜的。”
    真正孤立的，恰恰是一小撮帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。他们与全世界人民为敌，倒行逆施，做尽了坏事，早已陷入世界人民的重重包围之中。这一小撮害人虫的寿命不长了，它们凄厉的抽泣声正在被隆隆前进的历史车轮声所淹没。一切反华的“英雄好汉”们，都注定要被全世界革命人民处以绞刑！
