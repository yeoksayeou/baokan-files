On the first anniversary of the publication of the "Sixteen Points," which was personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Company of a certain air force unit stationed in Wuhan reviewed this guiding document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, combining it with the actual struggle of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. They discussed the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and seriously examined and summarized the experiences and lessons from their support-leftist work. They emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement in human history. The attitude towards the revolutionary masses is essentially the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The officers and soldiers unanimously declared: The People's Liberation Army, created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary faction, fight together, and win together, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

The attitude towards the revolutionary masses is essentially the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Five Good Soldier, Squad Leader Sun Zhantun said: Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao fully embodies this great and brilliant thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have been mobilized. The revolutionary mass movement is like a storm, irresistible. A handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party, government, and army have been exposed by the proletarian revolutionary faction. The bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev has been smashed to pieces by the proletarian revolutionary faction. In one year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved extremely brilliant victories.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the broad laboring masses. The bourgeois reactionary line represents the decaying bourgeois reactionary forces. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party stand opposed to the revolutionary masses, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, directing their spears at the proletarian revolutionary faction, labeling the revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," attempting to obstruct and strangle the revolutionary mass movement, and strangle the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and carry out this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, support all their revolutionary actions, and protect the proletarian revolutionary faction.

Only by firmly standing on the proletarian standpoint can one correctly deal with the revolutionary mass movement and resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary faction

Squad Leader Qie Renzhi said: In the complex class struggle, to identify the leftists and resolutely support the leftists, one must first have a leftist standpoint, leftist thoughts, leftist feelings, and leftist revolutionary spirit. Only by unshakably standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can one firmly stand on the side of the leftists and unambiguously, with clear banners, support the proletarian revolutionary faction.

In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in Wuhan, the proletarian revolutionary organizations such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Command Revolutionary Alliance" in Wuhan, in order to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fearlessly faced the violence, directed their spears at China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and army in Wuhan, as well as a handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, and launched a fierce struggle, smashing their crazy counterattacks. The proletarian revolutionary faction has created extremely great achievements in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and army in Wuhan, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary restoration goals, used various despicable means to create rumors, confuse right and wrong, and invert black and white, temporarily deceiving us, making us unaware of the truth, unable to distinguish friends from enemies, and causing some misunderstandings and estrangement between us and the proletarian revolutionary faction in terms of thoughts and feelings. The recent great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in Wuhan has deeply educated us, opened our eyes, made us see the true facts, and see the counter-revolutionary faces of China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and army in Wuhan; at the same time, it also made us truly recognize that the revolutionary direction of the young revolutionaries is completely correct, and their revolutionary actions are very good! In the practice of struggle, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we corrected our direction and truly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction in terms of politics, thoughts, and actions, resolutely supporting the revolutionary leftists, thinking what they think, worrying about what they worry about, and establishing a deep class feeling with the proletarian revolutionary faction in the common struggle. We deeply feel that only by standing on the right side, correcting our direction, sitting on the side of the revolutionaries, having the same thoughts and feelings as the proletarian revolutionary faction, can we truly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, truly understand all the revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and unambiguously, without hesitation, wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary faction.

Fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary faction to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The officers and soldiers unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, fully mobilizing all the positive factors of the masses. Without the masses, we will achieve nothing.

Soldier Wei Tongfu said: The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and army in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are cornered and desperately counterattacking, openly directing their spears at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. At this critical moment, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Wuhan fearlessly faces the siege, fearlessly faces the violence, and stands up. We tightly stand with them, vowing to defend Chairman Mao, vowing to defend Vice Chairman Lin, vowing to defend the Party Central Committee, vowing to defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and repelling the arrogant attacks of the class enemies, achieving great victories. The facts of class struggle have educated us that in the sharp and complex class struggle, we must first believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and our hearts must be filled with the word "masses," resolutely supporting the leftists, fully protecting the leftists, and standing together, fighting together, to achieve the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, be highly alert to the tricks of the class enemies, and no matter how great the risks, we, the People's Liberation Army, vow to be the strong rear guard of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The sea can dry up, and the stones can rot, but our determination to support the revolutionary leftists will never change! We will forever be heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary faction, breathing together, sharing the same fate, relentlessly pursuing the "fallen dogs," and thoroughly criticizing, exposing, overthrowing, and smashing China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and army in Wuhan.

To correctly deal with the revolutionary mass movement, resolutely support the leftists, the fundamental and key point is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well

Political Instructor Fu Shiwang said: Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the Party, the army, and the whole country." In the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are studying Chairman Mao's works eagerly, using Mao Zedong Thought as a political telescope and microscope to observe and analyze everything, exposing one by one the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, government, army, and cultural circles. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To avoid losing direction and standing on the wrong side in the complex class struggle, to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary faction, one must, like the proletarian revolutionary faction, place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position that is prior to everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and higher than everything. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and support the broad leftist masses, and we must first study Chairman Mao's works well. In the struggle, we must learn and apply, consult Chairman Mao's works, learn from the broad revolutionary factions, eliminate selfish and impure thoughts, plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we, in any situation, have a clear direction, a stable standpoint, see far, and truly achieve unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever fighting and winning with the proletarian revolutionary faction. Otherwise, we will not be able to fully understand and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and there will be deviations in our actions. In the past year of the Cultural Revolution, we have had experiences of achieving victories by following Chairman Mao's instructions, and we have also had lessons of making mistakes and suffering setbacks by slightly deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must always remember these experiences and lessons, and in the future support-leftist work, further study, familiarize, master, and defend the "Sixteen Points," and carry out the "Sixteen Points" without the slightest deviation, to achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    支持革命派　保卫革命派
    ——武汉空军某部七连结合支左实践重温“十六条”
    新华社武汉八日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条发表一周年的时候，人民解放军驻武汉空军某部七连指战员，结合武汉地区文化大革命的斗争实际，重温了这一无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文献，畅谈毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，认真检查和总结在支左工作中的经验教训。大家强调指出，无产阶级文化大革命是人类历史上规模空前的伟大的革命群众运动。对待革命群众的态度问题，实质上就是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。指战员们一致表示：毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远同无产阶级革命派心连心、肩并肩，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    对待革命群众的态度问题，实质上就是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题
    五好战士、班长孙占训说：毛主席历来教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，充分地体现了这一伟大的光辉思想。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，亿万革命群众发动起来了，革命的群众运动如暴风骤雨，势不可当。混进党里、政府里、军队里的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，被无产阶级革命派揪出来了，以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总头目的资产阶级司令部被无产阶级革命派打得七零八落了。一年来，无产阶级文化大革命取得了极其辉煌的胜利。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线代表了广大劳动人民的根本利益。资产阶级反动路线则代表腐朽的资产阶级反动势力。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派站在革命群众的对立面，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把矛头指向无产阶级革命派，把革命群众打成“反革命”，企图阻止与扼杀革命的群众运动，扼杀文化大革命。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是要充分发动群众，依靠群众，进行这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，支持他们的一切革命行动，保卫无产阶级革命派。
    只有坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，才能正确地对待革命的群众运动，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派
    班长戚仁志说：在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，要识别左派，坚决支持左派，首先自己必须具有左派的立场，左派的思想，左派的感情，左派的革命精神。只有坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能坚定地站在左派一边，毫不含糊地、旗帜鲜明地支持无产阶级革命派。
    在武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗中，武汉的“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等无产阶级革命派组织，为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不畏强暴，向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，展开了艰苦卓绝的斗争，并粉碎了他们的疯狂反扑。无产阶级革命派为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线创造了非常巨大的业绩。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人，为了达到他们反革命复辟的罪恶目的，采取种种卑鄙手段，制造谣言，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，使我们一时受了蒙蔽，不明真相，不辨敌友，和无产阶级革命派之间一度在思想感情上造成一些误解和隔阂。最近武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗，深深地教育了我们，给我们擦亮了眼睛，使我们看清了事实真相，看清了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人的反革命嘴脸；同时也使我们真正认识到革命小将的大方向是完全正确的，他们的革命行动好得很！在斗争实践中，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们端正了方向，从政治上、思想上、行动上，真正转到无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持革命左派，想他们所想，急他们所急，并和无产阶级革命派在共同的战斗中，迅速地建立起了深厚的阶级感情。我们深深体会到，立场站对了，方向端正了，屁股坐在革命派一边了，和无产阶级革命派有了共同的思想，共同的感情，才能真正站在无产阶级革命派的立场上，真正理解无产阶级革命派的一切革命行动，才能旗帜鲜明地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派。
    紧紧同革命派并肩战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”指战员一致指出，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是相信群众，依靠群众，把群众的一切积极因素都充分调动起来。离开了群众，我们则将一事无成。
    战士霓同富说：武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，狗急跳墙，进行疯狂的反扑，明目张胆地把矛头指向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。在这紧要关头，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派不怕围攻，不畏强暴，挺身而出。我们紧紧地同他们战斗在一起，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫林副主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫中央文革，打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，取得了伟大胜利。阶级斗争的事实教育了我们，在尖锐复杂的阶级搏斗中，首先要相信群众，依靠群众，心窝里一定要装有“群众”二字，坚决支持左派，全力保卫左派，和他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，高度警惕阶级敌人的阴谋，不管遇到多大的风险，我们人民解放军誓作无产阶级革命派坚强的后盾，海可枯，石可烂，支持革命左派的决心永不变！我们永远同无产阶级革命派心连心，肩并肩，同呼吸，共命运，穷追猛打“落水狗”，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人统统批深、批透、批倒、批臭。
    正确对待革命群众运动，坚决支持左派，根本的根本，关键的关键，是学好用好毛主席著作
    指导员符士旺说：林副主席教导我们：“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”在汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万革命群众如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜和显微镜去观察一切，分析一切，把混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化界的资产阶级代表人物一个一个地揪了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    要在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，不迷失方向，不站错队，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，就要象无产阶级革命派那样，把学习毛主席著作摆在先于一切、大于一切、重于一切、高于一切的位置上。我们要用毛泽东思想来教育、支持左派广大群众，自己必须首先学好毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，向毛主席著作请教，向广大革命派学习，清除私心杂念，在头脑里扎上毛泽东思想的根子，树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。只有这样，才能在任何情况下，方向明，立场稳，站得高，看得远，才能真正做到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远和无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，胜利在一起。否则，我们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就不能很好地理解，贯彻就会打折扣，执行就会出偏差。在一年来的文化大革命中，我们按毛主席的指示办事取得胜利的经验也有，稍微离开毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使工作受到挫折，犯了错误的教训也有。我们要永远记取这些经验和教训，在今后的支左工作中，进一步学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，保卫十六条，不折不扣地按十六条办事，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的更大胜利。
