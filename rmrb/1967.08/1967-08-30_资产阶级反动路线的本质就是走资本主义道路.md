In the Chinese Communist Party, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in a long and fierce struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev.

The essence of the struggle between the two lines is the question of where China is heading: whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. The focal point of the struggle has always been the issue of state power. The essence of the proletarian revolutionary line is to take the socialist road. The essence of the bourgeois reactionary line is to take the capitalist road. Chairman Mao said: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." The struggle between the two lines is as incompatible as fire and water.

The struggle between the two lines is concentrated in their attitudes towards the masses.

The proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "We have always advocated that the revolution should rely on the masses." The mass line is a fundamental principle of Marxism. How to treat the masses is the touchstone for distinguishing true Marxists from false ones, and it is the fundamental difference between historical materialism and historical idealism.

China's Khrushchev stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, believing only in the bourgeoisie and relying on the bourgeoisie, viewing the broad masses and cadres as submissive and dependent on the "benevolence" of others, seeing himself as a savior. Like all reactionary classes in history, he regards the masses as "mob," as "dregs," as "chips" in a gambling game. It is a direct continuation! In the Cultural Revolution, his extremely hostile attitude towards the masses was thoroughly exposed.

However, not long ago, China's Khrushchev feigned ignorance, saying he didn't know why he "proposed and promoted the bourgeois reactionary line"! This is like saying "there is no silver here" while trying to hide three hundred pieces of it. His opposition to the people's role in creating history has been consistent. He obsequiously praised the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, as a "revolutionary banner," and treated the words of the warlord Yan Xishan as "sacred edicts," believing that without these "great figures," China would not be able to survive. He shamelessly bowed down to the "capitalist gentlemen," begging to be "exploited," saying: "If I am exploited, I will have food to eat, and my wife and children will be able to live. If I am not exploited and not allowed to work, then it will be disastrous!" In China's Khrushchev's view, it is not the billions of revolutionary people who create history, but a few tyrants who ride on the heads of the people; it is not the workers who support the capitalists, but the capitalists who support the workers! He opposes Mao Zedong Thought and the people's masses for decades, how can he say he is "not clear" about it? China's Khrushchev's strategy of using defense as offense is really clumsy. The more he says he is "not clear," the more the revolutionary masses see through the true reactionary face of this tyrant.

China's Khrushchev's view of the people completely distorts history. This is because he represents the backward and decadent reactionaries who are doomed to perish. His reactionary class position determines that his method of looking at things is subjective and metaphysical, upside down. The ancients said: "How can one see the sky while wearing a basin on one's head?" He cannot see the vast sky that objectively exists! Of course, he will not understand that destroying the bourgeois headquarters will make the sky even clearer and the world even better! His reactionary class instincts indeed make him unable to see many things that are clear to us.

Starting from this reactionary position, China's Khrushchev must oppose mass movements and suppress mass movements. In the Cultural Revolution, he cursed the revolutionary mass movement as "troublemakers," as "organized and planned conspiracies," as "disruptions," as "hooligan" and "counter-revolutionary" movements. Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" exposed his reactionary nature with one stroke: "Standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the fiery and magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, confusing right and wrong, creating chaos, besieging the revolutionary forces, suppressing dissenting opinions, implementing white terror, feeling proud, boosting the bourgeois morale, and crushing the proletarian spirit, how poisonous it is!"

The attitude towards mass movements is a major political principle. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "Revolutionary mass movements are naturally reasonable. Although there are some 'left' and right deviations among the masses, the mainstream of mass movements always conforms to the development of society and is reasonable." As early as more than forty years ago, Chairman Mao enthusiastically welcomed the rise of the peasant movement, praising the peasants' rebellion as "very good," and severely criticized the reactionary remarks that slandered the peasant revolutionary movement as a so-called "hooligan movement." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the first big-character poster in the country, supporting the newly born Red Guard movement, supporting the power seizure struggle in January. Chairman Mao is thus a great proletarian revolutionary who is truly connected with the people, a great helmsman of the Chinese and world revolution!

Opposing revolutionary mass movements is opposing the revolution. Lenin said: "To make a revolution but not to conduct 'mass revolutionary struggle' is impossible. Such a revolution has never existed." The bourgeoisie can never and will not carry out genuine mass movements. Once the masses rise up, step out of the bounds, and touch their class interests, they will immediately turn around and suppress them. China's Khrushchev sometimes talks about mass movements, but when the masses truly rise up, he panics, cursing the masses as "rioters," arresting "rightists" and "counter-revolutionaries" everywhere. He is doing exactly what Chiang Kai-shek did, talking about "arousing the masses" every day, but when the masses rise up, he turns around and suppresses them fiercely. He hangs the sign of "revolution," but does the same counter-revolutionary deeds as Chiang Kai-shek.

Opposing mass movements is opposing socialism. Chairman Mao said that the socialist revolution and socialist construction must adhere to the mass line, mobilize the masses, and carry out mass movements. Socialism is a grand revolutionary cause, and it is unimaginable without extensive and in-depth mass movements.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev's activities of suppressing mass movements and restoring capitalism have reached their peak. He not only suppresses revolutionary mass movements but also strikes at the broad cadres who demand revolution, even directing his spearhead at the proletarian headquarters. When he was cornered by the all-out attack of the proletarian revolutionary forces, he resorted to his old tricks, bringing back his "stone-throwing" tactics from the land reform movement and the "big replacement" and "all resignations" from the Four Clean-ups movement, fully applying his opportunist line of "left" in form but right in essence to the Cultural Revolution. He not only spread the anarchist trend of "doubt everything, overthrow everything" but also openly called for the Central Cultural Revolution Group to "retreat to the second line." He even incited counter-revolutionaries to "be more active, write more reactionary slogans, and issue more reactionary statements," brazenly opposing our great leader Chairman Mao! After he was sidelined, he continued in various forms, through his henchmen placed in various places, to instigate armed struggles, create chaos, and continue to fight against the proletariat. This is the continuation of the struggle between the two lines, and the continuation of the struggle between taking the socialist road and the capitalist road. It seems that this struggle will continue for a considerable period. But China's Khrushchev blabbers about "old revolutionaries encountering new problems." No, you are an old reactionary, an old opportunist, promoting the bourgeois reactionary line is your "old problem" for decades! Fifty days of the bourgeois reactionary line is the continuation of the capitalist road you have insisted on for ten or twenty years; fifty days are to cover up the ten or twenty years of capitalist road you have insisted on. As early as the democratic revolution, you followed in the footsteps of Chen Duxiu, cursing the workers' movement as "excessive," "leftist to the extreme," and gnashing your teeth to demand that the Beiyang government "expel a few overzealous worker leaders," all for the purpose of opposing the armed seizure of power by the proletariat. In the socialist revolution, you ordered "workers not to cause trouble," told peasants to "rebel against overzealousness," and lectured the party "not to be intoxicated by victory," all for the purpose of developing capitalism and establishing bourgeois dictatorship. After the basic completion of the transformation of ownership, you, unchanged in your evil ways, viciously attacked the Great Leap Forward as "madness," slandered the mass movement as "rising in a frenzy," and claimed it was "actually empty." In the Four Clean-ups movement, you advocated that "the masses are like wild horses, once mobilized, they will cause chaos," all for the purpose of restoring capitalism. You have been consistent for forty years, once the mass movement rises, you suppress it fiercely, familiar and unexceptional, what kind of "new problem" is this? How can you slip away under this thin smoke screen? Those who suppress mass movements will not have a good end. The Beiyang warlords suppressed mass movements, Chiang Kai-shek also suppressed mass movements, and they all ended up being buried by the tide of mass movements. China's Khrushchev's end will not be better than his predecessors.

China's Khrushchev is still not a "dead tiger," he is still biting people. Recently, he maliciously said: "After criticizing my mistakes at the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, someone else made similar mistakes, but they also don't know why."

Indeed, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many of our good and relatively good cadres, due to their own stand and worldview, have made mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. However, the main responsibility lies with you, the old reactionary! It is you who, under the name of the Party Central Committee, issued black directives, making the broad cadres fall into a big trap! It is you who, for a long time, propagated the black "Cultivation," poisoning the broad cadres with slavish ideology! It is you who proposed and promoted this bourgeois reactionary line, creating opposition between the broad cadres and the masses! This account must be settled with you! Their mistakes are absolutely unrelated to your counter-revolutionary activities. You want to drag people down with you, but it is in vain.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power, led by China's Khrushchev, must implement the bourgeois reactionary line, which is determined by their common reactionary stance. However, those who have implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made different degrees of line errors, as long as they do not insist on these errors, do not insist on taking the capitalist road, and are willing to correct their mistakes with the help of the masses, can still become good cadres of the party.

The struggle between the two lines is long-term. This struggle existed in the past, exists now, and will continue in the future.

Do not think that pulling down China's Khrushchev will root out this bourgeois reactionary line. As Lenin said, "Its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." Seizing power is not enough to just seize organizational power. Only by seizing ideological power at the same time can the organizational power already seized be consolidated. This bourgeois reactionary line has been deeply harmful over the past few decades, especially in the past eighteen years. In some people's minds, it has formed a habitual force. To thoroughly eliminate this, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize and expose it! Use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions!

Do not think that by overthrowing this bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev, no new bourgeois reactionary line will emerge. That will not happen! As long as the bourgeoisie exists, as long as the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie exists, and as long as the struggle between the two roads exists, new black lines may emerge. We must be soberly aware of this.

Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary forces, after seizing power, face two possible choices: one possibility is to always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve their political awareness, rely on the masses, adhere to the mass line, and adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship; the other possibility is to gradually develop arrogance and self-satisfaction in victory, gradually stop listening to opposing opinions, even suppress them, alienate from the masses, become officials and lords, and be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. In this way, they will unknowingly slide to the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, possibly becoming new representatives of the bourgeoisie, and inevitably implementing bourgeois dictatorship and restoring capitalism. China's Khrushchev is still beckoning! "Be vigilant, never let your guard down." (August 27)

    资产阶级反动路线的本质就是走资本主义道路
   《文汇报》编辑部　《解放日报》编辑部　《支部生活》编辑部
    在中国共产党内，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，长期以来，一直激烈地进行着斗争。
    两条路线斗争的本质，就是中国向何处去的问题，是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。斗争的集中点，始终是一个政权问题。无产阶级革命路线的本质是走社会主义道路。资产阶级反动路线的本质是走资本主义道路。毛主席说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”一红一黑，两条路线的斗争就是这样水火不相容的。
    两条路线的斗争，集中表现在对群众的态度上。
    无产阶级的革命路线，就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众”。群众观点是马克思主义的一个根本观点。如何对待群众，是检验真假马克思主义者的试金石，是历史唯物论和历史唯心论的根本分歧。
    中国赫鲁晓夫站在反动资产阶级立场上，只是相信资产阶级，依靠资产阶级，把广大群众和干部看作俯首贴耳、靠别人“恩赐”的阿斗，把自己看作救世主。他同历史上的一切反动阶级一样，把群众看作是“群氓”，是“渣滓”，是赌博用的“筹码”。完全是一脉相承！在文化大革命中，他的这种极端仇视群众的反革命立场，得到了彻底的大暴露。
    但是，不久前中国赫鲁晓夫却假痴假呆地说，他自己也“不清楚为什么”“提出和推行资产阶级反动路线”！真是此地无银三百两。他反对人民创造历史的观点，一以贯之，从来就是这样的。他卑躬屈膝地吹捧人民公敌蒋介石是“革命的旗帜”，把大军阀头子阎锡山的话奉若“圣旨”，以为离开这些“大人物”，中国就会生存不下去。他无耻地拜倒在“资本家先生”跟前请求“剥削”，说：“剥削一下，我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去。如果不剥削，不让我工作，那就不得了！”在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，创造历史的不是亿万革命人民，倒是一两个骑在人民头上的暴君；不是工人养活资本家，倒是资本家养活工人！他反对毛泽东思想，反对人民群众几十年如一日，怎么能说“不清楚”呢？中国赫鲁晓夫用这种以守为攻的策略，实在太蹩脚了。他越是说“不清楚”，广大革命群众非但没有被他弄糊涂，反而越发清楚地识破了这个独夫民贼的反革命真面目。
    中国赫鲁晓夫对于人民群众的看法，完全颠倒了历史。这是因为，他所代表的是落后的腐朽的反动派，是注定要灭亡的。他的反动阶级立场，决定他看事物的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的，是头脚倒置的。古人说：“戴盆何以望天？”他看不见客观存在的广阔的天空！他当然不会懂得，摧毁了资产阶级司令部，天空只会更加晴朗，世界只会更加美好！他的反动的阶级本能，的确使他看不清楚许多在我们看来十分清楚的事情。
    从这个反动立场出发，中国赫鲁晓夫必然反对群众运动，镇压群众运动。在文化大革命中，他咒骂革命的群众运动是“坏人捣乱”，是“有组织、有计划的阴谋活动”，是“干扰”，是“小流氓”、“小反革命”的痞子运动。毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报一针见血地揭穿了他的反动本质：“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！”
    对待群众运动的态度，是个重大政治原则问题。正如林彪同志所说：“革命的群众运动，它天然是合理的。尽管群众中有个别的部分、个别的人，有‘左’有右的偏差，但是群众运动的主流总是适合社会的发展的，总是合理的。”早在四十多年前，毛主席就以最大的热情欢呼农民运动的兴起，欢呼农民起来造反“好得很”，并痛斥了把农民革命运动污蔑为所谓“痞子运动”的反革命言论。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席亲自批准发表了全国第一张马列主义大字报，支持了新生的红卫兵运动，支持了“一月革命”的夺权斗争。毛主席就是这样无限地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神，并及时把群众的创造加以总结提高，推动了整个运动的发展。毛主席就是这样一位真正同人民血肉相连的伟大的无产阶级革命家，就是这样一位中国革命和世界革命的伟大舵手！
    反对革命的群众运动，就是反对革命。列宁说：“要革命，但又不进行‘群众性的革命斗争’，这是不可能的。这样的革命从来也没有过。”资产阶级从来不可能也不肯搞真正的群众运动。一旦群众起来了，越出雷池一步，触及他们的阶级利益时，就迫不及待地回过头来镇压。中国赫鲁晓夫有时也空谈什么群众运动，但是，当群众真正起来时，他就慌了手脚，大骂群众是“暴徒”，到处抓“右派”，抓“反革命”。他干的完全是蒋介石的那一套，嘴里天天说“唤起民众”，民众起来了，就反过来进行疯狂的镇压。他挂了“革命”的招牌，干的却是同蒋介石一样的反革命勾当。
    反对群众运动，就是反对社会主义。毛主席说，社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必须坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。社会主义是空前宏伟的革命事业，没有广泛而深入的群众运动，是绝对不能想象的。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫的镇压群众运动、复辟资本主义的活动达到了登峰造极的地步。他不仅压制革命的群众运动，还打击广大要求革命的干部起来革命，甚至直接把矛头指向无产阶级司令部。当他在无产阶级革命派的总攻击面前，陷入穷途末路的时候，又施展故技，把他在土改运动中那一套“搬石头”，以及四清运动中要干部“大换班”、“统统罢官”的形“左”实右的机会主义路线，全盘搬到文化大革命中来了。他不仅到处散布“怀疑一切、打倒一切”的无政府主义思潮，而且公然叫嚷要中央文革小组“退到二线去”。甚至丧心病狂地鼓动反革命分子“多活动一点，多写一点反动标语，多发表一些反动言论”，猖狂地直接反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席！在他靠了边以后，还继续以各种形式，通过他安插在各地的爪牙，挑动武斗，制造混乱，同无产阶级继续进行较量。这是两条路线斗争的继续，也是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路斗争的继续。看来，这场斗争，还将继续一个相当的时期。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么是“老革命遇到新问题”。不对，你是老反革命，老机会主义分子，推行资产阶级反动路线是你几十年来的“老问题”！五十天的资产阶级反动路线，是你十年、二十年的资产阶级反动路线的继续；五十天，就是为了掩护十年、二十年所坚持的资本主义道路。早在民主革命中，你就跟在陈独秀的屁股后面，咒骂工人运动“过分”，“‘左’倾得岂有此理”，并且咬牙切齿要北洋政府“开除几个冒进的工人领袖”，目的就是反对无产阶级武装夺取政权。在社会主义革命中，你命令“工人不要捣乱”，要农民“反一下冒进”，教训党“不要被胜利冲昏头脑”，目的就是要发展资本主义，建立资产阶级专政。在所有制改造基本完成后，你贼性不改，恶毒地攻击大跃进是“发疯”，污蔑群众运动是“一轰而起”，“实际上是空空洞洞”。在四清运动中，宣扬“群众象野马一样，发动起来就会出乱子”，目的仍是为了复辟资本主义。你四十年如一日，群众运动一起来，就拚命镇压，轻车熟路，一无例外，这算得了什么“新问题”呢？你怎么可能在这一阵薄薄的烟幕下溜掉呢？凡是镇压群众运动的人都没有好下场。北洋军阀镇压群众运动，蒋介石也镇压群众运动，他们最后都落得个被群众运动的怒涛所埋葬。中国赫鲁晓夫的下场，也不会比他的前辈好一些。
    中国赫鲁晓夫现在还不是一只“死老虎”，他仍在咬人。最近，他又别有用心地说：“在八届十一中全会上批判了我的错误之后，又有人犯同类性质的错误，可是他们也不知为什么”。
    不错，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们有不少好的和比较好的干部，由于自己立场、世界观有问题，犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。但是，主要的责任要由你这个老反革命负！是你，盗用了党中央名义，发布黑指示，使广大干部上了大当！是你，长期宣扬黑《修养》，使广大干部受到奴隶主义的荼毒！又是你，提出和推行这一条资产阶级反动路线，制造广大干部和群众的对立！这笔账，一定要同你算清楚！他们犯错误，同你进行的反革命活动，绝对扯不到一块去。你想在这里拖人下水，那是徒劳的。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，必然执行资产阶级反动路线，这是他们共同的反革命立场所决定的。但是，执行过资产阶级反动路线的人，犯有不同程度的路线错误的人，只要不坚持这种错误，不坚持走资本主义道路，愿意在群众的帮助之下，改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就仍然可以成为党的好干部。
    两条路线的斗争是长期的。这场斗争，过去有，现在有，将来还会有。
    不要以为，把中国赫鲁晓夫拉下了马，他这条资产阶级反动路线就可以连根铲除了。正如列宁所说，“它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”夺权，光夺了组织上的权是不行的。只有把思想上的权也同时夺下来，才能巩固已经夺到手的组织上的权。这条资产阶级反动路线，几十年来，特别是最近十八年来，流毒很广，贻害很深，在一些人的头脑中，形成为一股习惯力量。要彻底肃清这一套东西，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把它彻底批倒、批臭！用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地！
    更不要以为，搞掉了这条以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，就不会出现新的资产阶级反动路线了。没有那回事！只要还存在着资产阶级，还存在着无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，存在着两条道路的斗争，就有可能产生新的黑线。我们必须清醒地看到这一点。
    因此，无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，面临着两条可能的选择：一个可能是，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，依靠群众，坚持群众路线，坚持毛主席的革命路线，巩固和加强无产阶级专政；一个可能是，在胜利中逐渐滋长骄傲自满的情绪，反对的意见逐渐听不进去了，甚至加以压制，脱离了群众，做官当老爷，被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所击中。这样，就会稀里糊涂地滑到资产阶级反动路线方面去，有可能成为新的资产阶级代表人物，必然要搞资产阶级专政，搞资本主义复辟。中国赫鲁晓夫还在那里招手哩！“千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”　（八月二十七日）
