People's Liberation Army troops from the army, navy, and air force have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." They have warmly welcomed the editorials published in *People's Daily* and *PLA Daily* calling for a more extensive and enthusiastic campaign to support the army and love the people. They have immediately taken action, determined to join revolutionary masses nationwide to launch this campaign of great significance on a larger scale and with great fervor.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the three services have pointed out with revolutionary enthusiasm that "supporting the army and loving the people" is Chairman Mao's consistent brilliant idea, a priceless treasure for victory. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has new content and even greater significance. It is a strategic slogan for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We firmly support it and will carry it out resolutely. They have expressed that as the army, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, raise the banner of loving the people even higher, and do everything possible to cherish and support the revolutionary masses, cherish and support the Red Guards, and cherish and support the revolutionary masses. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will handle military-civilian relations well, strengthen military-civilian unity, and in the great struggle to defend our country's national defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry out the "three supports and two militaries," thoroughly criticize and destroy the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and advance bravely to achieve new merits for the people.

Since the editorials were published in *People's Daily* and *PLA Daily* on the 28th, calling for a more extensive and enthusiastic campaign to support the army and love the people, PLA units across the country have quickly launched a new high tide of the love-the-people movement. The Party committees of the Beijing, Lanzhou, and Inner Mongolia units, as well as the Party committees of units 6900 and 7848, have all held committee meetings to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great instructions on launching the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement. They have researched and deployed specific measures to immediately launch this great movement and have made resolutions, solemnly calling on all subordinate units to immediately launch extensive and in-depth propaganda and study activities on supporting the army and loving the people among all personnel. Based on improved awareness and understanding, and according to the unit's tasks and the specific situation of the region, they have quickly and universally formulated new, practical love-the-people pacts. In the past two days, the Henan Military Region and the Henan "August 7th Commune," the Lanzhou garrison and the Gansu "Red Three Commands," the Xi'an 8133 unit, the Yanbian 3168 unit, and local revolutionary masses, as well as the Zhejiang 7350 and 6409 units, the Guilin 6955 unit, the Qinghai Military Region and the Xi'ning garrison, and many other units have all held grand support-the-army-and-love-the-people meetings or parades. Deputy Political Commissar Wang Xin of the Henan Military Region said at the support-the-army-and-love-the-people meeting, "Today, under the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, strengthening military-civilian unity is of particularly great significance. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, raise the great banner of supporting the army and loving the people, and launch a more extensive and enthusiastic love-the-people movement."

Recently, the leaders of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison conducted a comprehensive review of their "support-left" work and widely solicited opinions from the masses. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Don't be afraid of criticism. The entire army will correctly understand the world and change the world in this process of criticism." When soliciting opinions, they did not blush when hearing sharp words or argue when hearing harsh words; they improved as they listened. They categorized and prioritized the opinions from all directions, studied them item by item, and explained them to the masses one by one. In Tianjin, some soldiers and officers participating in the "three supports and two militaries" work went deep into workshops, teams, and various revolutionary mass organizations to hold discussion meetings and heart-to-heart talks, humbly listening to the masses' criticisms and receiving warm praise from the revolutionary masses, further strengthening military-civilian unity. In Changchun, the leaders of the Jilin Military Region and the garrison also personally solicited opinions from revolutionary mass organizations, listened to criticisms, and further strengthened military-civilian unity and close military-civilian relations. The support-left unit stationed in Ningxia, which is fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses, invited local revolutionary masses to the unit to report on their struggles in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The comrades from units 3174, 7111, and 3792 stationed in Anshan, along with the leaders of revolutionary organizations such as the "Anshan Guarding Mao Zedong Thought Combat Headquarters," jointly studied and formulated the "support-the-army-and-love-the-people" pact based on the local situation. The 7212, 7252, and 8199 units in the Wuhan area, the 6037 unit stationed in Qingdao, the 7113 unit stationed in Henan, as well as the Qinghai Military Region and the Inner Mongolia garrison, have also been seriously studying the editorials, summarizing support-left work experiences, checking love-the-people work, and formulating love-the-people pacts. The 6011 and 6810 units stationed in Jiangxi, while formulating the love-the-people pact, also extensively launched propaganda activities for exemplary deeds of supporting the army and loving the people, setting up models and encouraging all soldiers and officers to strive to be exemplary in loving the people.

In Shanghai, Jinan, Taiyuan, Guiyang, Harbin, and Xining, the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the garrison have expressed with great passion in the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement that they will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and the trust of the revolutionary masses. They will definitely raise the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" even higher, continuously achieve new merits and new labor for the people, and forever be exemplary in loving the people. They said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has put new and higher demands on our army. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely cherish and support the revolutionary masses, handle military-civilian relations well, be models of unity, and make new contributions to further launching the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly destroying the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers guarding the coastal and border defense lines in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan have expressed with high morale while studying Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" and formulating the love-the-people pact that they will definitely maintain high vigilance, with the help of revolutionary masses, do a good job in preparing for war, strengthen national defense, and make the greatest contributions in defending proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieving new merits for the people.
