Hong Kong's news industry and patriotic compatriots from all walks of life have issued statements strongly supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note. They express heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for their support. They are determined to carry the just struggle against British oppression to the end. They warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: You must comply within 48 hours and revoke the ban on publication, and release patriotic journalists.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 21st, fourteen patriotic newspapers and news agencies, as well as patriotic compatriots from various sectors in Hong Kong, issued statements and speeches today. They strongly support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' serious protest to the British government regarding the British authorities in Hong Kong's savage persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry. They express heartfelt gratitude for the warm concern and great support of the great leader Chairman Mao and the 700 million people of the motherland. They vow to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for the final victory in the struggle against British oppression.

The joint statement issued by the fourteen patriotic newspapers and news agencies, including the *Wen Wei Po*, *Ta Kung Pao*, *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Xinwu Bao*, and *Tianfeng Daily*, said: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note is a practical manifestation of the 700 million Chinese people's firm backing for their compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is the strongest support from our great leader Chairman Mao for the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their struggle against British oppression. It makes us feel greatly inspired. We strongly and resolutely support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note.

The joint statement emphasized: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note is a stern warning to the Hong Kong British fascist authorities and a severe warning to those fascist perpetrators. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will absolutely not tolerate the British imperialists bullying their own flesh and blood at the doorstep of our country. They will absolutely not allow the oppression of our patriotic compatriots by fascist means. Those who foolishly hope that the Chinese people will not support the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their struggle against British oppression should wake up.

Workers who are persistently striking pointed out excitedly that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note is a powerful blow to the British authorities in Hong Kong. It is not only strong support for patriotic journalists but also the greatest support and encouragement for striking workers.

As the vanguard of the struggle against British oppression, patriotic students firmly said, justice cannot be suppressed. If the British authorities close down our three newspapers, we will publish small newspapers in various forms and have everyone act as volunteer reporters to engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with British imperialism.

Educators said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note comes at a very timely moment, giving a powerful blow to the enemy. This is a great encouragement and support for Hong Kong's patriotic compatriots. Currently, the British authorities in Hong Kong are trying to use fascist "laws" to persecute Hong Kong's patriotic education cause. However, patriotic educators will not be intimidated by the enemy. They will fight back with broader and more intense struggles.

Patriotic compatriots from various sectors, including publishing, film, sports, commerce, and women, also issued speeches, firmly supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note and expressing heartfelt gratitude for the motherland's support.

Hong Kong's news industry, workers, and patriotic compatriots from all walks of life sternly warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: You must comply within 48 hours with the serious demands of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Immediately revoke the ban on the three patriotic newspapers, immediately release all illegally abducted patriotic journalists, immediately cancel the illegal lawsuits against the four patriotic news agencies, and restore the normal operations of the aforementioned newspapers and printing companies. Otherwise, you will be fully responsible for all serious consequences that may arise.

    据新华社香港二十一日电　香港十四家爱国报社和爱国新闻机构，以及香港各界爱国同胞今天纷纷发表声明和谈话，最热烈拥护我外交部就港英当局野蛮迫害香港爱国新闻事业向英国政府提出的严重抗议。他们衷心感谢伟大领袖毛主席和祖国七亿人民的亲切关怀和巨大支持，并表示一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓夺反英抗暴斗争的最后胜利。
    香港《文汇报》、《大公报》、《香港夜报》、《新午报》、《田丰日报》等十四家爱国报社和爱国新闻机构发表的联合声明说：我外交部的照会，是七亿中国人民誓为港九同胞坚强后盾的实际表现，是我们伟大领袖毛主席对港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争最有力的支持，使我们感到无比振奋。我们最热烈和最坚决地拥护我外交部照会。
    联合声明强调指出：我外交部的照会是对港英法西斯当局的当头棒喝，是对那些法西斯暴行者的严厉警告。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，绝对不能容忍港英帝国主义在我国的大门口欺凌自己的亲骨肉，绝对不容许它对我爱国同胞进行法西斯迫害。那些指望中国人民不支持港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的蠢人们，你们应该清醒过来了。
    坚持大罢工斗争的各业工人兴奋地指出，我国外交部照会是给港英当局的强有力的一棒，它不但是对爱国新闻工作者的强有力的支持，也是对大罢工工人的最大的支持和最大的鼓舞。
    作为反英抗暴斗争先锋力量的爱国学生们坚定地说，正义的事业是压不倒的，港英封我们三家报纸，我们就要以各种形式大办小型报纸，人人当义务记者，同港英帝国主义展开针锋相对的斗争。
    教育工作者说，我外交部的照会来得非常适时，正好给敌人以有力的打击，这是对香港爱国同胞的极大鼓舞和支持。目前，港英当局正妄图以法西斯“法令”来迫害香港爱国教育事业，但是，爱国教育工作者绝不为敌人所吓倒，他们将以更广泛、更激烈的斗争来回击敌人。
    出版、电影、体育、工商、妇女等各界爱国同胞也纷纷发表谈话，坚决拥护我外交部的照会，衷心感谢祖国的支持。
    香港新闻界和香港工人以及各界爱国同胞严厉警告港英当局：必须老老实实在四十八小时内接受我外交部提出的严正要求，立即撤销对三家爱国报纸的“停刊令”，立即释放所有被非法绑架的爱国新闻工作者，立即取消对四家爱国新闻机构的非法诉讼，并恢复上述各报纸及印刷公司的正常业务。否则，由此引起的一切严重后果将由你们全部负责。
