The workers of Wenjin Pass in Ba'anan County, Guangdong Province, in response to the provocations of the British police and military in Hong Kong who tore down our anti-British, anti-violence slogans and big-character posters, bravely ventured into the lion's den to the British police station in Wenjin Pass to fight back. Twenty-something unarmed Chinese workers bravely and cleverly disarmed dozens of fully armed British soldiers, forcing them to sign a "confession of guilt" and returning triumphantly. The workers of Wenjin Pass have shown the might of the Chinese working class, striking fear into the hearts of the British imperialists. Comrades, you have done well, you have done a great job.

Our Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "What is the best weapon? It is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. What is the greatest combat effectiveness? The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." The workers of Wenjin Pass are heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They deeply hate, despise, and look down upon British imperialism. They have the greatest bravery, the greatest wisdom and intelligence. In the face of the great image of the Chinese working class, how small and pathetic British imperialism appears!

The brave struggle of the Chinese workers of Wenjin Pass once again proves the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no power to be reckoned with." British imperialism in Hong Kong is fierce and vicious, seemingly very powerful, but in reality, how is it? Our twenty-something brave and clever Chinese workers can make a fully armed British invading army tremble with fear. This paper tiger of British imperialism has truly exposed its ugly face and made a complete fool of itself in Wenjin Pass.

The British authorities in Hong Kong, in order to cover up their shame, have been spreading propaganda about how our workers "provoked" them, and the British government has even made "protests" and so on. This is simply outrageous. Putting up big-character posters and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is a sacred and inviolable right of our workers, a matter of course. The workers of Wenjin Pass, through struggle, had already forced the British authorities in Wenjin Pass to sign a guarantee on August 5 not to tear down the big-character posters. Yet four days later, the British invading army went back on their word and brazenly tore down our workers' big-character posters again. You are playing the hooligan, deliberately provoking us, and the workers of Wenjin Pass have given you a small lesson. You deserve it!

To be honest, British imperialism in Hong Kong owes the Chinese people a great deal, and all debts must be repaid. The actions taken by the Chinese workers of Wenjin Pass are just a timely warning to you!

    文锦渡工人干得漂亮
    本报评论员
    我广东省宝安县文锦渡搬运工人，为了反击港英军警撕毁我反英抗暴标语和大字报的挑衅行为，为了捍卫宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，深入虎穴，到港英文锦渡警署造了反。二十几名赤手空拳的中国工人勇敢机智地把数十名全副武装的英军缴了械，迫使他们签署了“认罪保证书”，凯旋归来。文锦渡工人“杀”出了中国工人阶级的威风，吓破了港英帝国主义的狗胆。文锦渡的工人同志们，你们干得好，干得漂亮。
    我们的副统帅林彪同志说：“什么是最好的武器？不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。什么是最大的战斗力？最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”文锦渡工人是用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄汉。他们无限仇视、鄙视、蔑视英帝国主义。他们有最大的勇敢，最大的聪明和智慧。在我国工人阶级的高大形象面前，港英帝国主义显得何等渺小！何等可怜！
    文锦渡中国工人的英勇斗争，又一次证明了我们伟大导师毛主席的英明论断：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”英帝国主义在香港张牙舞爪，穷凶极恶，样子似乎很神气，实际怎样呢？我们二十几名勇敢机智的中国工人，就能够把一个连全副武装的英国侵略军吓得屁滚尿流。英帝国主义这只纸老虎，在文锦渡真是丑态毕露，出尽洋相。
    港英当局为了掩饰它们的丑态，大肆宣传什么我国工人“挑衅”，英国政府还提什么“抗议”等等。这简直是岂有此理。贴大字报，宣传毛泽东思想，是我国工人神圣不可侵犯的权利，是天经地义的事情。我文锦渡工人经过斗争，曾经在八月五日迫使文锦渡港英当局签署了不撕毁大字报的保证书。而四天之后，英国侵略军就自食其言，又悍然撕毁我国工人的大字报。你们这样大耍流氓，故意挑衅，文锦渡的中国工人给了你们一顿小小的教训，这有什么可以大惊小怪的！你们咎由自取，活该！
    老实说，英帝国主义在香港对中国人民欠下的债还多着呢，所有的债都必须偿还。文锦渡中国工人所采取的行动，只是给你们的一个及时的警告！
