	To Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Defense of the People's Republic of China,

	Dear Comrade Lin Biao:

	On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian People's Army, and in my personal capacity, extend revolutionary greetings and heartfelt congratulations to you and, through you, to the heroic Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	The Chinese People's Liberation Army, established, led, and educated by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, has ensured the victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China through its long and miraculous struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people. It has maintained and further greatly developed its glorious revolutionary traditions, firmly and faithfully adhering to the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of the Communist Party in the construction and development of the army; it possesses a high degree of proletarian revolutionary consciousness and spirit; it is loyal to the people and the revolution, implementing the Party's and Mao Zedong's thoughts and teachings, making and continuing to make outstanding contributions to the successful advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great cause of socialism.

	The Chinese army is a reliable and steadfast defender of the People's Republic of China and socialism.

	The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, educated in the great Marxist-Leninist revolutionary thought and proletarian internationalism, have raised the banner of the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist revolution in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership. They have become a powerful backbone for all revolutionary and oppressed peoples of the world.

	The seven hundred million Chinese people and their heroic army have achieved brilliant victories in the rapid development of science and technology, successfully detonating the first hydrogen bomb on June 17 of this year. This is a major historical event that inspires and encourages all progressive and peace-loving people. It finally ends the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism. This is an extremely great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong Thought. This victory greatly inspires our people and our army.

	The revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples and armies of our two countries, based on the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, are constantly developing and strengthening. No force can destroy this people's friendship and unity, for it has been tempered by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our great leaders Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong.

	On this occasion, we sincerely wish our brotherly Chinese people and our comrades-in-arms, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, greater new victories in the struggle for the construction of socialism, for the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for the continuous strengthening of combat readiness and the enhancement of combat effectiveness, for the defense of the socialist motherland, Asia, and world peace.

	Long live the eternal friendship and combat unity between the peoples and armies of Albania and China!

	"Under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the heroic military and people of the South have achieved brilliant victories in the important initial stage of the partial invasion war of American imperialism, especially in the winter and spring of 1966-1967. The people and various liberation armed forces of the South have achieved great victories, defeating the second dry-season strategic counteroffensive of the American bandits with more than a million American, puppet, and mercenary troops."

	The telegram points out that although American imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it remains very stubborn and unwilling to abandon its ambition to invade Vietnam. The telegram expresses that the entire army and people of Vietnam are determined to unite as one, fear no sacrifice, endure hardships, advance in victory, and completely defeat the American aggressors.

	The telegram wishes the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army more brilliant victories in the construction of socialism and the consolidation of national defense, to smash at any time the various plots and actions of American imperialism's aggression, and to contribute to the safeguarding of peace in Asia and the world.

Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become a powerful army equipped with modern technology, defending and developing the achievements of the socialist revolution together with the entire people, ready at any time to smash the plots and provocations of American imperialism and its lackeys to make war, resolutely supporting the national liberation movement, making great contributions to the safeguarding of peace in Asia and the world.
