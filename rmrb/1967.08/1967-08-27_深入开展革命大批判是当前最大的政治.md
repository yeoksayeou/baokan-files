Highly raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, wage a "people's war," and thoroughly criticize and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev.

Deepening the revolutionary criticism is the current largest political task.

The Wuhan Garrison Command and representatives of revolutionary organizations held a symposium, unanimously pointing out: Revolutionary criticism is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we better promote revolutionary unity, raise the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" higher, truly identify and examine cadres, create conditions for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 26th - The Wuhan Garrison Command and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations such as Steel General, Steel Second Bureau, Steel 913, New Hua Workers, New Lake University, New Hua Farmers, and Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance recently held a symposium to discuss how to further deepen the revolutionary criticism. They unanimously expressed their determination to highly raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, and mobilize all possible propaganda machines to make the atmosphere of revolutionary criticism thick, wage a great "people's war," and bury the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region in the vast ocean of the "people's war," thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.

Our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, calls on us: "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end!" The comrades participating in the symposium, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, unanimously pointed out: Revolutionary criticism is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a century-long, millennium-long, ten-thousand-year plan. To ensure that our party and country remain unchanged for thousands of years, we must politically, ideologically, and theoretically thoroughly overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois headquarters headed by him, and cut off the claws of the bourgeois headquarters reaching out to various places. Therefore, the urgent revolutionary criticism is our current largest direction of struggle, largest political task, largest class interest, and largest national affair. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions must consider and handle all issues based on this revolutionary criticism and serve this revolutionary criticism movement.

Everyone also explained with vivid examples that although the proletarian revolutionary factions have many things to do at present, highly raising the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the top priority. By grasping revolutionary criticism, everything can be promoted, and work in all aspects can be vigorously carried out. They said: Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we better promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The great unity and alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions are formed, consolidated, and developed in the common struggle against the enemy. Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we truly educate, win over, and unite the deceived masses. By exposing, denouncing, criticizing, and fighting against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, we can make the deceived class brothers truly realize that they are victims of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, thereby raising their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, making a comeback, and standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to fight together with the revolutionary factions. Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we raise the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" higher. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, fighting side by side in the revolutionary criticism, can make the military-civilian relationship even closer. Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we truly identify and examine cadres, further creating conditions for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Only by grasping revolutionary criticism can we truly arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, boost revolutionary morale, implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and make production more, faster, better, and more economical.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." At the meeting, representatives of Steel General, Steel Second Bureau, Steel 913, New Hua Workers, New Lake University, New Hua Farmers, and Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance emphasized in their speeches: To further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and develop the revolutionary criticism movement in depth, we must fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. We must unite all possible forces, organize large and small denunciation meetings, report meetings, criticism meetings, and struggle meetings; we must mobilize all possible propaganda machines, fully utilize newspapers, radio, big-character posters, cartoons, picture exhibitions, literary propaganda, and other weapons' combat effectiveness, making the atmosphere of revolutionary criticism thick, and setting up a "people's war" net. In this way, "everyone is a soldier," participating in the revolutionary criticism movement, organizing and planning battle after battle, we will surely be able to politically, ideologically, and theoretically thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and achieve a thorough victory in this great "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. Everyone also reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle," unanimously expressing: Revolutionary criticism is arduous and meticulous work, a 200-meter hard task, and we must definitely master this key link of "ideological education" and practice this basic skill well. They said: There may always be some confused thoughts among a part of the masses, which must be discovered and corrected in time. For example, when we fight and criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, some comrades say this is fighting a "dead tiger" and going to "catch a live one." We should target this "live thought," and educate these comrades in a targeted manner, making them realize that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party are paper tigers but not dead tigers. Every proletarian revolutionary faction must heighten revolutionary vigilance, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, and criticize and fight them down, making them never able to rise again.

Our great commander Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Commander Lin Biao pointed out: "What is the best weapon? It is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought."

Wuhan Garrison Political Commissar Zhang Chunqing excitedly said at the meeting: This symposium is a meeting to highly raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, a meeting to grasp the direction of struggle, and a meeting to emphasize politics. Vice Chairman Lin taught us: "Among thousands of principles, the first principle is to educate people with Mao Zedong Thought." We must remember Vice Chairman Lin's teachings, closely follow Chairman Mao, and closely follow the Party Central Committee in the Cultural Revolution. We will do as Chairman Mao says. The process of revolutionary criticism is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the real class struggle. Revolutionary criticism is a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.

The representatives present unanimously agreed that the revolutionary criticism movement must be closely combined with the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism, and through revolutionary criticism, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide.

    高举毛泽东思想红旗，打一场“人民战争”，彻底批倒中国赫鲁晓夫
    深入开展革命大批判是当前最大的政治
    武汉警备司令部和革命组织代表举行座谈会，一致指出：革命的大批判是毛主席的伟大战略部署。只有抓住革命的大批判，才能更好地促进革命大联合，更高地举起“拥军爱民”旗帜，真正地识别和考察干部，为革命的“三结合”创造条件，贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针
    据新华社武汉二十六日电　武汉警备司令部和钢工总、钢二司、钢九一三、新华工、新湖大、新华农、三司革联等革命群众组织代表，最近召开座谈会，讨论如何进一步深入开展革命的大批判。他们一致表示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放手发动群众，开动一切可以开动的宣传机器，把革命大批判的空气搞得浓浓的，打一场伟大的“人民战争”，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人埋葬在“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”参加座谈会的同志满怀革命激情地一致指出：革命的大批判是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。要保证我们党和国家千秋万代永不变色，就必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫和以他为首的资产阶级司令部彻底打倒，把资产阶级司令部伸向各地的魔爪连根斩断。因此，刻不容缓的革命大批判，是我们当前最大的斗争方向，最大的政治任务，最大的阶级利益，最大的国家大事。当前，无产阶级革命派考虑和处理一切问题，必须从这场革命大批判出发，服从这场革命大批判运动。
    大家还以生动的事例说明，尽管无产阶级革命派当前要做的事千头万绪，但是，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗是头等大事。把革命的大批判抓好了，就能带动一切，把各方面的工作都蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。他们说：只有抓住革命的大批判，才能更好地促进无产阶级革命派的大联合。无产阶级革命派的大团结、大联合，是在共同的对敌斗争中形成、巩固和发展的。只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正教育、争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众。通过揭发、控诉、批判、斗争中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，就能使受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟真正认识到自己是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，从而从思想上提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟，大杀回马枪，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，和革命派共同战斗。只有抓住革命的大批判，才能更高地举起“拥军爱民”的旗帜。无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员，在革命的大批判中，并肩战斗，共同对敌，就能使军民关系更加亲密。只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正地识别和考察干部，为革命的“三结合”进一步创造条件。只有抓住革命的大批判，才能真正激发广大职工的革命热情，鼓足革命干劲，贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把生产搞得又多、又快、又好、又省。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”会上，钢工总、钢二司、钢九一三、新华工、新湖大、新华农和三司革联的代表在发言中强调指出：要进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，使革命大批判运动向纵深方向发展，必须充分相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神。要团结一切可以团结的力量，组织大大小小的控诉会、报告会、批判会和斗争会；要开动一切可以开动的宣传机器，充分发挥报纸、广播、大字报、漫画、图片展览、文艺宣传等各种武器的战斗作用，把革命大批判的空气搞得浓浓的，布下“人民战争”的天罗地网。这样，“全民皆兵”，投入革命大批判运动，有组织、有计划地一个战役一个战役的打，就一定能够从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，取得革命大批判这场伟大的“人民战争”的彻底胜利。大家还重温了毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的伟大教导，一致表示：革命的大批判，是艰苦细致的工作，是二百米硬功夫，一定要“掌握思想教育”这个中心环节，把这一基本功练好。他们说：在一部分群众中随时都可能存在这样或那样的糊涂思想，要及时发现、及时纠正。比如我们在斗争、批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派时，个别同志却说这是打“死老虎”，要去“抓活的”。我们就应该针对这个“活思想”，有的放矢地去启发、教育这些同志，使他们认识到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是纸老虎，但还不是死老虎。每一个无产阶级革命派必须提高革命警惕，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，把它们批倒、斗臭，叫它们永世不得翻身。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅指出：“什么是最好的武器？不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。”
    武汉警备区政治委员张纯青在会上激动地说：这个座谈会是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的会议，是掌握斗争大方向的会议，是突出政治的会议。林副主席教导我们：“千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育人是第一条。”我们必须牢记林副主席的教导，在文化大革命中紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央。毛主席怎么讲，我们就怎么做。革命大批判的过程，就是在现实的阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的过程。革命的大批判，就是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。我们一定要用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    到会代表一致认为，要把革命的大批判运动与开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动紧密地结合起来，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命的大批判，通过革命的大批判，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮。
