Chinese embassies in Cambodia, Pakistan, Laos, Burma, India, and Nepal held receptions on August 1 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

At the reception held by the Chinese embassy in Cambodia, over 300 Cambodian dignitaries, including the presidents of the two houses of the Cambodian parliament, the commander-in-chief of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces, high-ranking government officials, representatives of mass organizations and students, as well as prominent figures from various sectors, extended warm congratulations to the Chinese embassy staff.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk's personal advisor Bin Nu and Prince Norodom Naradip, who had just returned from a holiday in China, were also invited to the reception.

At the reception, many Cambodian friends gazed at the bust of Chairman Mao with affection and respect, unwilling to leave. Some Cambodian friends stood in front of the quotation board of Chairman Mao and recited his quotations. Many Cambodian friends eagerly took Chairman Mao's brilliant works and Chairman Mao badges. A worker, after taking several of Chairman Mao's works, said, "I took so many because they are for my fellow workers. They love Chairman Mao and admire the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought." A young man happily took a badge and asked a Chinese friend to pin it on his chest, excitedly saying, "We love the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life."

Many friends highly praised Chairman Mao's great military thought and the Chinese People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. One friend said, "The Chinese army armed with the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and strongest army in the world." He added, "Chairman Mao's strategy of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and 'surrounding the cities from the countryside' is completely correct. It has shown the people of the world the way to victory."

At the reception held by the acting military attaché of the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, Yangang, the guests included Pakistani Defense, Interior, and Kashmir Affairs Minister A. R. Khan, Agriculture and Engineering Minister Shamsoodha, and other high-ranking government officials, military officers from the three services, prominent figures from various sectors, and diplomats from several countries stationed in Pakistan.

Some guests at the reception enthusiastically praised the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao. One guest said, "The great Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, has grown from scratch and become an invincible force, defending all revolutionary people in the world."

Many guests eagerly took Chairman Mao's military works and Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" from the book exhibition table, as well as various Chairman Mao badges. A Pakistani friend pinned a badge on his chest and said, "Long live the great commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao!"

The military attaché of the Chinese embassy in Laos, Yi Fei, held a reception. Attendees included people from various sectors in Laos and diplomats.

In Rangoon, the military attaché of the Chinese embassy in Burma, Xu Zhongjiu, held a reception despite the anti-China frenzy of the Ne Win reactionary government. Diplomats from several countries stationed in Burma and other foreign diplomats attended the reception. Many patriotic overseas Chinese braved numerous obstacles and difficulties to courageously attend the reception.

Many foreign friends expressed great respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They requested Chairman Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

At the reception held by the acting head of the Chinese embassy in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, about 150 Indian friends, despite the obstruction and anti-China hysteria of the Indian reactionary authorities, went to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Many Indian friends expressed their love for Chairman Mao and wished him eternal life. They praised Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought and eagerly took "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao's works on people's war.

In Kathmandu, more than 140 Nepalese from various sectors attended the reception held by the acting head of the Chinese embassy in Nepal, Li Buqiao. Among them were Nepalese Defense Minister Giri Prasad Budhathoki, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Nepalese Army Surendra Bahadur Shah, and Chief of the General Staff of the Royal Nepalese Army Singha Bahadur Basnyat.

The president of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, Purna Bahadur, and the chairman of the Nepal-China Cultural Association, Buban Lal Pradhan, also attended the reception.
