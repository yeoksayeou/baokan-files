The color documentary film "Beijing Supports You" is a triumphant anthem of Mao Zedong Thought. It faithfully reflects the strongest support from Beijing's proletarian revolutionary forces to the broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan's three cities, and the strongest condemnation of the handful of power-holders within the Party in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road. This film is well-made—it boosts the morale of the proletariat and crushes the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, leaving one full of energy!

The handful of power-holders within the Party in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, stand on the reactionary bourgeois stance, stubbornly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They suppress the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan, implementing white terror. They think that by doing so, they can maintain their bourgeois dictatorship. Their calculations are wrong; they have lifted the stone only to drop it on their own feet.

The waters of the Yangtze River cannot flow backward, and the wheels of history cannot roll back. The handful of power-holders within the Party in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, who were temporarily rampant, have been exposed by the revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionary forces are pushing the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan to new heights. Heroic proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan, heroic revolutionary people of Wuhan, Beijing supports you! All the warriors of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory learn from you and salute you! In this life-and-death class struggle, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, you have fought a relentless battle. Now, you are further carrying forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, pursuing and attacking the "fallen dogs," and with the greatest revolutionary courage and audacity, you are inspiring, educating, and winning over all the deceived masses, isolating the handful of incorrigible bad leaders!

We proletarian revolutionary forces deeply understand that the army is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, the most beloved people who hold the guns for the revolutionary masses. Without the army, there would be no socialist mountains and rivers! "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people."

The film records the powerful demonstration of the People's Liberation Army, loyal to Chairman Mao, holding high the banner of "supporting the left" in Wuhan, and also captures the touching scenes of Wuhan's revolutionary people offering tea and water, lining the streets to welcome their loved ones. Everywhere, there are large banners reading "The army has come, and the sky is bright." We are deeply moved. We are determined, together with the revolutionary people of Wuhan's three cities, to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people." Whether in wind or rain, we will always believe in and rely on the army, and strive together to firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan are now increasingly isolated. However, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The enemy's isolation does not equal our victory. If we make policy mistakes, we still cannot achieve victory." We must follow Chairman Mao's words, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, and fiercely strike down the biggest handful of "snakes" in China. No matter how "pitiful" they may appear, we must not pity them. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, focus on the revolution, and vigorously promote production; we must follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

    坚决支持武汉的革命派
    ——《北京支持你们》观后
    北京第二机床厂革命造反总部
    彩色纪录影片《北京支持你们》是毛泽东思想的一支凯歌。它忠实地反映了北京市无产阶级革命派对武汉三镇广大革命群众最强大的声援，对武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派最强烈的声讨。这部影片拍得好——长了无产阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风，看了浑身有劲！
    武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，站在反动的资产阶级的立场上，顽固地同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部相对抗。他们在武汉地区镇压无产阶级革命派，实行白色恐怖。他们以为这样做就可以保持他们的资产阶级专政。他们的算盘打错了，他们搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
    长江的水不会倒流，历史的车轮不能倒退。疯狂一时的武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已被革命群众揪了出来，无产阶级革命派正把武汉地区的文化大革命运动推向新的高潮。英雄的武汉无产阶级革命派，英雄的武汉革命军民，北京支持你们！北京第二机床厂革命造反总部的全体战士向你们学习，向你们致敬！在这场你死我活的阶级斗争的大决战中，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，你们进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗。现在你们正进一步发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，穷追猛打“落水狗”，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，以最大的革命气魄和胆略来启发、教育和争取一切受蒙蔽的群众，把一小撮死不回头的坏头头彻底孤立起来！
    我们无产阶级革命派深深认识到，解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是替革命群众掌握枪杆子的最可爱的人。没有解放军，就没有社会主义江山！“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    影片纪录了忠实于毛主席的人民解放军高举“支持左派”的大旗在武汉举行的强大示威，也拍下了武汉革命人民端茶送水、夹道迎亲人的动人场面，到处是“解放军来了，天亮了”的大幅标语。我们看后非常感动，我们决心和武汉三镇的革命人民一道，坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的号召，无论风里雨里，永远相信解放军，永远依靠解放军，为坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底而共同奋斗。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在武汉地区的代理人现在已经越来越孤立。但是我们必须牢记毛主席的教导：“敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”我们一定要听毛主席的话，高举革命批判的旗帜，狠狠打击中国最大的一小撮“蛇一样的恶人”，不管他们装出多么“可怜”的样子，我们决不能怜惜他们。我们要加强敌情观念，狠抓革命，猛促生产；我们要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
