	Albanian "People's Voice" Says China's Downing of U.S. Planes is a Heavy Blow to U.S. Imperialism

	China is a Powerful Defender of the World Revolutionary Cause

	NEW YORK, August 25 -- The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on August 25, celebrating the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in shooting down two U.S. aggressor planes that intruded into Chinese airspace. The commentary also strongly condemned the war provocations of U.S. imperialism.

	The commentary pointed out that China is the standard-bearer in the struggle against the U.S.-Soviet plan to dominate the world. China has become a powerful defender of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries and of the revolutionary cause. The great victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the magnificent achievements in socialist construction and the continuous strengthening of its powerful national defense forces, have driven the U.S. imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists into a frenzy.

	The commentary said that the U.S. air bandits' provocation on August 21 in China's Guangxi region received its due punishment. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force units gloriously fulfilled their duty. This is a great support for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and it is also a heavy blow to the military provocations of U.S. imperialism.

	The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists, in an attempt to salvage their failures in Vietnam, are trying to escalate their military actions in Vietnam, expand the war of aggression to other countries in Southeast Asia, and continuously provoke the powerful and reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people, the People's Republic of China. This is sheer fantasy. Whether it is the escalation of aggression or the full support of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, it will not save the U.S. imperialists from defeat.

    阿《人民之声报》指出我全歼美机是对美帝的沉重打击
    中国是世界革命事业的强大保卫者
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十五日发表评论，欢呼中国人民解放军空军全歼入侵中国领空的两架美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利，并严厉谴责美帝国主义的战争挑衅。
    评论指出，中国是反对美苏主宰世界计划的斗争旗手，中国已经成为各国人民的自由和独立、革命事业的强大保卫者。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展、在社会主义建设和不断加强巨大的国防力量方面所取得的宏伟成就，使美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者暴跳如雷。
    评论说，美国空中强盗八月二十一日在中国广西地区的挑衅，受到了应有的惩罚。中国人民解放军空军部队光荣地完成了自己的职责。这是对进行抗美救国斗争的越南人民的巨大支持，也是对美帝国主义军事挑衅的沉重打击。
    评论说，美帝国主义者企图通过不断在越南扩大军事行动、把侵略战火扩大到东南亚其它国家，以及通过对越南人民强大和可靠的后方中华人民共和国的不断挑衅来挽救它在越南遭到的失败，这完全是妄想。不管是侵略升级，还是勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团对它的全面支持，都挽救不了美帝国主义者的失败。
