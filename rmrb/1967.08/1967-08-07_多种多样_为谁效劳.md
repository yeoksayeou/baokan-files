    "Diverse and Varied" for Whom?
    Five-Good Soldier  Li Qing

    Hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat is the trick of the trade for speculators. Zhou Yang, this cunning and crafty revisionist, is very familiar with this trick and uses it skillfully. For seventeen years, he has hung up the colorful sign of "popular literature and art" to sell the black goods of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism for the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, deceiving quite a few people. The so-called "satisfying the diverse needs of the broad masses" is one of the most harmful tricks. What "the needs of the people are multifaceted," "literary creation allows for diversity," "do not interpret art serving politics too narrowly" ... on the left, "broad masses," on the right, "mass needs," talking so fluently, as if there is some substance to it.

    However, "fake is fake, and the disguise should be removed." Look back at the literary works of the past seventeen years, how many truly meet the needs of the revolutionary people? Very few. On the contrary, the workers, peasants, and soldiers need performing arts troupes, but Zhou Yang, following the intentions of his master, ruthlessly cuts them down; the workers, peasants, and soldiers need to see their own heroes, but Zhou Yang brings out emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties; the workers, peasants, and soldiers need to reflect their own fiery struggle, but Zhou Yang focuses on flowers, birds, insects, and plants. Four high walls keep the workers, peasants, and soldiers out, and a high platform presses them down.

    So, for whom has Zhou Yang been busy for seventeen years, supposedly satisfying the diverse needs? Today it is clear, what Zhou Yang has been doing are all the needs of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party! Look at the two of them: one advocates "three freedoms and one contract" and individual farming is good, the other promotes "Two Families"; one advocates class reconciliation, the other throws out "Lin's Shop," advocating labor-capital cooperation; one absurdly says "exploitation is meritorious," the other has "City That Never Sleeps"; one wants to "boost morale," the other offers up "Swan Lake"; one wants to oppose the Party and Chairman Mao, the other cultivates "Hai Rui's Memorial" to criticize indirectly... one plays at restoring the old system, the other uses literary works to create public opinion. Singing and responding, closely cooperating. No wonder the Chinese Khrushchev regards Zhou Yang as a confidant, trusting him greatly.

    Today, the diverse restoration plots of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party have all failed, and Zhou Yang's diverse efforts for his master have also completely failed.

    “多种多样”为谁效劳
    五好战士　李庆
    挂羊头卖狗肉是投机商人的生财秘诀。周扬这个老奸巨猾的修正主义分子，对这条秘诀滚瓜烂熟，运用自如。十七年来他挂起五光十色的“全民文艺”的招牌，为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大卖资、封、修的黑货，着实骗了不少人。所谓“满足”“广大人民”“多种多样的需要”，就是其中一块害人不浅的破招牌。什么“人民的需要是多方面的”呀，“文艺创作允许多样性”呀，“不要把艺术为政治服务了解得太狭隘”呀……左一个“广大人民”，右一个“群众需要”，说得天花乱坠，好象颇有点名堂。
    然而，“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”翻翻十七年来的文艺作品，真正为革命人民需要的有多少呢？很少很少。相反，工农兵需要文工团，周扬却秉承其主子的“剧场艺术”的意旨，大杀大砍；工农兵需要看自己的英雄人物，周扬却抬出帝王将相、才子佳人；工农兵需要反映自己火热的斗争生活，周扬却大搞花鸟虫草。四面大墙把工农兵关在门外，一座高台把工农兵压在底下。
    那末，周扬十七年来忙忙碌碌究竟满足了谁的“多种多样的需要”呢？今天可以看清楚了，周扬搞的都是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所需要的！你看他们两个：一个鼓吹“三自一包”单干好，一个就捧出《两家人》；一个鼓吹阶级调和，一个就抛出《林家铺子》，宣扬劳资合作；一个胡说“剥削有功”，一个就有《不夜城》；一个要“提高兴致”，一个就献上《天鹅湖》；一个要反党反毛主席，一个就培植《海瑞上疏》来指桑骂槐……一个大耍复辟阴谋，一个就用文艺作品制造舆论。一唱一和，密切配合。难怪中国赫鲁晓夫把周扬视为心腹，信赖得很。
    今天，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的多种多样复辟阴谋都已破产，周扬为他主子所做的多种多样的努力也彻底完蛋了。
