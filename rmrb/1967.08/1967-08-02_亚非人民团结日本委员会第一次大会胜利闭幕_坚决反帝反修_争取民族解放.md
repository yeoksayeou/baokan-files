The first congress of the Japan Committee for Asian and African Solidarity was held in Tokyo on July 29 and concluded on July 30. This congress was convened after the organization's split with the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party in November of last year. It was also held under the auspices of the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the rapid development of the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It was a congress of unity, struggle, and victory.

The two-day congress adopted a declaration stating that the Japan Committee for Asian and African Solidarity will stand together with the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, hoisting the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and strive forward for national independence and liberation. The declaration pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and is advancing victoriously. China is the most solid bulwark of socialist revolution and national liberation.

The declaration expressed support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, as well as the anti-American struggles of the peoples of Laos and Cambodia. It also supported the armed struggles of the peoples of Burma, India, Malaya, the Philippines, and the peoples of Africa and Latin America. The declaration also supported the just struggle of the American Negroes.

The declaration emphasized that in the current international class struggle, the Japanese reactionaries are willing to act as the gendarmes of American imperialism in Asia. Therefore, the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is an important international task.

The congress adopted a resolution supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The resolution stated that the victory of the Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of all countries, greatly shaking their foundations. This revolution is an infinite inspiration and aid to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are struggling for liberation and revolution. The Japanese people resolutely support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people and celebrate its victory. The Japanese people are arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and are determined to contribute to the liberation cause of the Japanese people, to the unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

The congress also adopted resolutions supporting the struggles of the Vietnamese people, the American Negroes, and the Arab people. The resolutions strongly condemned the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists in the Middle East issue against the Arab people.

The congress firmly demanded that American imperialism return Okinawa to Japan.

The congress elected Blackda Juman, Makino Uemon, Nakajima Kenzo, Takano Minoru as committee members and elected Sakamoto Tokumatsu and Itabana Shozo and 48 others as directors.

    亚非人民团结日本委员会第一次大会胜利闭幕
    坚决反帝反修　争取民族解放
    据新华社三十一日讯  据东方通讯社报道：亚非人民团结日本委员会第一次大会七月二十九日在东京开幕，三十日闭幕。这次大会是这个组织于去年十一月间同日共修正主义分子决裂之后的情况下召开的，同时又在中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利开展、亚非拉民族解放斗争迅速发展的大好形势下举行的。这是一次团结的大会、战斗的大会、胜利的大会。
    这次为期两天的大会通过宣言说：亚非人民团结日本委员会将同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民一起，高举反帝反修旗帜，为民族独立和解放而奋勇前进。宣言指出，由伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正在胜利地向前发展。中国是社会主义革命和民族解放的最坚固的堡垒。
    宣言支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争以及老挝和柬埔寨人民的反美斗争；支持缅甸、印度、马来亚、菲律宾人民的武装斗争和非洲、拉丁美洲人民的武装斗争；支持美国黑人的正义斗争。
    宣言强调说，在当前的国际阶级斗争中，日本反动派甘心充当美帝国主义的亚洲宪兵。因此，日本人民的反美爱国斗争，是一项重要的国际任务。
    大会通过了支持中国无产阶级文化大革命的决议。决议说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，给以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击，大大地动摇了它们的基础。这场大革命，对于为解放和革命而斗争的亚、非、拉各国人民来说，是无限的鼓舞、无限的援助。日本人民坚决支持中国人民的无产阶级文化大革命，并且欢呼它的胜利。日本人民正在用毛泽东思想武装自己，活学活用毛主席著作，决心为日本人民的解放事业、为亚非拉人民的团结、为日中两国人民的战斗友谊作出贡献。
    大会还通过了支持越南人民、美国黑人、阿拉伯人民斗争的决议。决议强烈谴责苏修在中东问题上对阿拉伯人民的叛卖。
    大会坚决要求美帝国主义把冲绳归还给日本。
