The fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia has once again launched a shocking anti-China atrocity. On August 5, they mobilized more than a thousand military police and thugs to brutally attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. They set fire to the embassy building and injured four embassy staff members. This is the most brazen provocation against the 700 million people of China, and it has naturally aroused the strongest indignation and most vehement protests from the countless Red Guards and revolutionary masses in our country, as well as all overseas patriotic compatriots!

The diplomatic personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia showed the great spirit of the Chinese people and the Chinese proletariat in the face of the bayonets and bullets of the Indonesian fascist bandits. When a large number of Indonesian thugs stormed into the embassy to commit violence, they were fearless and unyielding, putting up a resolute struggle. They defended the glorious five-star red flag of our motherland with their blood and bodies. These facts once again powerfully prove that the diplomatic personnel of socialist China possess the noble qualities of proletarian revolutionary fighters. They bear the sacred mission of defending the dignity of our motherland, defending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and defending the revolutionary interests of the international proletariat. In any perilous situation, in the face of any enemy, they will follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, surmount every difficulty to win victory." They are the brave warriors on the front lines of the international class struggle.

The comrades of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia are a fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Their glorious deeds of defending their posts and bravely fighting against the Indonesian fascist bandits are not only a great inspiration to the people of our motherland but also a great inspiration to the patriotic Chinese in Indonesia and the revolutionary people of Indonesia.

The Indonesian fascist military regime has committed an unprecedented barbaric crime but has the audacity to shirk its responsibility, claiming that it "does not know" about this anti-China violence and "does not know" the "motives" behind this anti-China violence. This only exposes its extreme cowardice and utter shamelessness!

What "does not know"?! This anti-China violence, like all previous anti-China violence, is completely an organized and planned action by you.

As early as late July, the Indonesian fascist military regime intensified preparations for further anti-China actions, inciting new anti-China frenzy. The head of the Indonesian fascist military, Suharto, openly spread lies and slandered China for allegedly setting up a "subversive network" in Indonesia. Rumors spread in Jakarta that a new wave of anti-China actions would erupt in early August. On the very day this anti-China violence occurred, the local authorities in Jakarta announced that they would forcibly demolish the walls of the Chinese Embassy to fan the flames of anti-China violence and create a pretext. The Indonesian fascist military regime is planning anti-China violence in such an organized manner. Can the word "does not know" cover up this fact?

At the scene of the anti-China violence, you cut off the telephone lines of our embassy, deployed so many troops, and coordinated with thugs to attack our embassy. Your military police openly obstructed our chargé d'affaires from driving to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Can all this not prove that you organized the anti-China violence? Can the word "does not know" cover up this fact?

Since the Suharto-Nasution military fascist clique came to power, whenever class struggles within the country intensify, internal strife within the ruling clique escalates, and the economic situation becomes increasingly chaotic, the reactionary regime faces more storms. This has become a pattern. It was the same in the past, and it is the same this time.

Today, the reactionary rule in Indonesia is in great chaos. The military fascist clique has sold out to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, oppressed the people with heavy taxes and exorbitant fees, and ruined Indonesia's economy to the point of collapse. Factories are closing down one after another. Fields are left fallow, grain production is reduced, and prices skyrocket overnight. The number of unemployed and underemployed people reaches 18 million. To suppress the people's strong discontent, the military fascist clique recently carried out another round of mass arrests and massacres, and the prisons across the country are overcrowded.

Since the right-wing military clique overthrew Sukarno, the factional struggles within it have intensified. The infighting among the big dogs, small dogs, and hungry dogs has become increasingly fierce. Suharto and Nasution's factions publicly curse each other, sabotage each other, and the situation is out of control. The fierce arguments within the right-wing military clique have deepened the crisis of the reactionary rule.

This group of public enemies of the Indonesian people is trying to use a new wave of anti-China actions to divert the people's attention, further curry favor with U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and find a way out. However, their way out is absolutely nonexistent.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in 1948 when talking about the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries: "They are so corrupt, so full of internal disputes that are increasing day by day and cannot be resolved, so despised by the people and completely isolated... Therefore, they are inevitably heading towards destruction." Today, the situation of the Indonesian reactionaries is the same. Their frenzied anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people actions can only promote the people's revolution and accelerate their own destruction.

    印尼反动派的绝望挣扎
    本报评论员
    以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人政权，又发动了一次骇人听闻的反华暴行。它们在八月五日出动一千多名军警和暴徒，对中国驻印尼大使馆进行野蛮的袭击，纵火焚烧使馆建筑物，打伤大使馆人员四人。这是对七亿中国人民的又一次最猖狂的挑衅，它理所当然地激起了我国千百万红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，以及一切海外爱国侨胞的最大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议！
    我国驻印尼大使馆的外交人员，在印尼法西斯强盗的刺刀和枪弹面前，表现了中国人民和中国无产阶级的伟大的硬骨头精神。当大批印尼暴徒冲入使馆行凶的时候，他们毫无畏惧，顽强不屈，进行了坚决的抵抗。他们用鲜血和胸膛，保卫了祖国光辉灿烂的五星红旗。这些事实再一次有力地证明，社会主义中国的外交人员，具有无产阶级革命战士的高贵品质。他们肩负着保卫祖国的尊严，保卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，保卫国际无产阶级的革命利益的崇高任务。在任何艰险的情况下，在任何敌人面前，他们都将按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们是国际阶级斗争战线上冲锋陷阵的勇猛的战士。
    我国驻印尼使馆的同志们是一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗的集体。他们坚守岗位，同印尼法西斯强盗英勇斗争的光荣事迹，不仅是对祖国人民的巨大鼓舞，也是对印尼爱国华侨和印尼广大革命人民的巨大鼓舞。
    印尼法西斯军人政权干下了罕见的野蛮罪行，却妄图推卸它的罪责，说什么它“不知道”这次反华暴行，“不知道”这次反华暴行的“动机”。这只能暴露它卑怯已极，无耻透顶！
    什么“不知道”？！这次反华暴行，同以前历次反华暴行一样，完全是你们有组织有计划进行的。
    早在七月底，印尼法西斯军人政权就加紧为进一步反华进行准备，煽动新的反华狂热。印尼法西斯军人头子苏哈托公然造谣诽谤中国在印尼设置所谓“颠覆网”。雅加达盛传八月初将掀起新的反华浪潮。直到这次反华暴行发生当天，雅加达地方当局还宣布要强行拆毁中国大使馆的围墙，来给反华暴行煽风点火，制造借口。印尼法西斯军人政权这样有计划地制造反华暴行，难道是“不知道”几个字所能抵赖得了的吗？
    在反华暴行的现场，你们切断了我使馆的电话，出动了那么多的军队，配合暴徒袭击我国大使馆，你们的军警公然阻拦我国临时代办驱车前往印尼外交部。这一切难道还不足以证明你们有组织地制造反华暴行，难道是“不知道”几个字所能抵赖得了的吗？
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安军人法西斯集团上台以来，每当国内阶级斗争尖锐化，统治集团内部倾轧加剧，经济状况越发不可收拾，压在人民头上的反动小朝廷更加风雨飘摇的时候，他们就要大肆反华。这已经成为一种规律。过去就是这样，这次也是这样。
    今天，印尼的反动统治正处在大混乱之中。军人法西斯集团对美帝苏修卖身投靠，对国内人民横征暴敛，把印尼的经济搞得百孔千疮，一塌糊涂。工厂纷纷停工倒闭。田地荒芜，粮食减产，物价一夜飞涨数倍。失业和半失业人数达一千八百万。为了压制人民的强烈不满，军人法西斯集团最近又一次实行大逮捕，大屠杀，全国监狱人满为患。
    印尼右派军人集团在搞掉苏加诺之后，它们之中的派系矛盾正在日益激化。一群大狗小狗饱狗饿狗之间的勾心斗角，你争我夺，愈演愈烈。苏哈托和纳苏蒂安两派公开对骂，互相拆台，闹得不可开交。右派军人集团内部的激烈争吵，更加深了反动统治的危机。
    这一伙印尼人民的公敌企图用新的反华浪潮来转移人民的视线，进一步投靠美帝苏修，寻找出路。但是，它们的出路是绝对没有的。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九四八年谈到蒋介石反动派时说：“他们是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立……因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”今天，印尼反动派的情况正是这样。它们疯狂地反共，反华，反人民，只能促进人民的革命，加速自己的灭亡。
