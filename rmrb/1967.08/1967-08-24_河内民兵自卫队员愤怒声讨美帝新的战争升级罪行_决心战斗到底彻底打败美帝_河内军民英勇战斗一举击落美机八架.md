Hanoi Militia Self-Defense Corps Members Angrily Denounce New War Escalation by U.S. Imperialists
Determined to Fight to the End and Defeat the U.S. Imperialists Completely
Hanoi Military and Civilians Bravely Fight and Shoot Down Eight U.S. Planes in One Battle

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd – According to preliminary information released here, the brave military and civilians of Hanoi on the 23rd achieved a brilliant victory in their fierce battle against American air pirates, shooting down eight American aggressor planes and killing or capturing multiple American air pirates.

This is the third consecutive day that American air pirates have attacked Hanoi. The well-prepared military and civilians of Hanoi fought bravely and dealt a heavy blow to the invading American air pirates.

According to another report, the military and civilians of Haiphong Province shot down one American plane and captured an American air pirate on the 23rd. The military and civilians of Vinh Phuc Province also shot down one American plane.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd – Our reporter reports: The recent frenzied attacks by American air pirates on Hanoi and the bombing of the Lang Son area near the Chinese border have infuriated the militia self-defense corps members of Hanoi. They angrily warn the American air pirate leader Johnson: The bombs of American imperialism cannot intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people. We are determined to fight to the end until there is not a single American aggressor on Vietnamese soil.

Comrade Ke, the head of the militia self-defense corps of a certain unit, told the reporter, “The frenzied attacks by American air pirates on the residential areas of Hanoi and the Lang Son area can only further ignite the hatred of the Vietnamese people and make them fight even more bravely. We firmly respond to Chairman Hu’s call to spare no effort to completely defeat the American aggressors. Whether it takes five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices, and we are determined to fight until we achieve complete victory.”

Comrade Xi, a militia self-defense corps member of a certain factory, excitedly told the reporter, “The American aggressors mistakenly believe that they can force the Vietnamese people to surrender with their bombs. This is a foolish dream. We are not afraid of the bombs of American aggressors and have no illusions about the American aggressors; only by completely defeating them can we achieve true independence and freedom.”

Comrade Jin, a militia self-defense corps member, said, “The consecutive attacks by American air pirates on Hanoi and the Lang Son area are a serious escalation of the war. The crimes committed by American aggressors can only arouse greater hatred among our people. We are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and join the army to fight against American aggressors on the front lines.”

Comrade Cheng, a female militia self-defense corps member of a certain factory, expressed, “We militia self-defense corps members fight while producing. We are determined to defend our posts, produce more products, and support the front lines. When enemy planes come, we will hit them hard. We female militia self-defense corps members are ready to take on the tasks of male comrades who join the army and ensure the completion of the tasks. Our determination is: fight to the end, liberate the South, and unify the country.”

Comrade Yuan, a militia self-defense corps member, angrily said, “No matter how vicious the murderer Johnson uses, he cannot intimidate us. We are determined to fight to the end until there is not a single American aggressor on our beloved land.”

The heroic militia self-defense corps members expressed their gratitude in their conversations to Comrade Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their precious and powerful support in both spirit and material to the Vietnamese people. They are inspired by the recent complete annihilation of two invading American aggressor planes in Chinese airspace by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force.

The heroic Vietnamese air defense troops stand guard on their positions, ready to give a fierce blow to the invading American air pirates.
