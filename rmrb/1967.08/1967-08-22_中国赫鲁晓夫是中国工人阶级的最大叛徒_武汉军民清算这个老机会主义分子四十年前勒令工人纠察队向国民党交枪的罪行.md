The greatest traitor to the Chinese working class, China's Khrushchev, was thoroughly exposed and condemned by the workers and soldiers of Wuhan for his heinous crime of ordering the workers' picket teams to surrender their weapons to the Kuomintang forty years ago.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 21st - The heinous crime of the top capitalist-roaders within the Party, who forty years ago in Wuhan betrayed the working class, sold out the revolution, and ordered the workers' picket teams to surrender their weapons to the Kuomintang, has been thoroughly exposed and condemned in the new wave of revolutionary criticism sweeping through Wuhan by the revolutionary masses and the stationed soldiers.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party is a great traitor to the working class and a sworn enemy of the Chinese people.

Some old members of the trade unions and workers' picket teams from the Great Revolution period in Wuhan have recently exposed and denounced the crime of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, who forty years ago ordered them to surrender their weapons to the Kuomintang. For forty years, they have never forgotten this old opportunist and revisionist's treacherous crime of betraying the revolution and selling out the workers. Now is the time to thoroughly settle accounts with him.

An old worker and former member of the workers' picket team, Zhong Hengshan, said at a meeting: The suffering of the working class in the old society is endless and indescribable. But just as we workers organized the picket teams and took up arms to fight the enemy, China's Khrushchev forced us to hand over our weapons to the enemy. This old counter-revolutionary also opposed our workers seizing power, saying, "Given the current situation in China, such an immature proletariat cannot immediately implement it. Since it is a distant reality, there is no need to discuss it at length." These words really infuriated me! Just in 1927, as soon as we organized and armed ourselves, we defeated the old imperialists and reclaimed the British concession, making the imperialists and feudal warlords scatter like fallen leaves and flowers. This revolutionary action greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese working class and crushed the arrogance of imperialism. Is this what you call "immature"? China's Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, simply could not see the great power of the proletariat, so he talked nonsense!

An old sailor who once participated in the workers' picket team, with boundless anger towards the top capitalist-roader within the Party, said, Chairman Mao teaches us, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The gun is the lifeline of the working class. With the gun, we have everything; without the gun, we lose everything. Initially, we workers were all empty-handed, without weapons. We thought day and night about arming ourselves, wanting weapons for the proletarian dictatorship. Only with weapons can we have power, only with weapons can we rise up. After the formation of the Wuhan workers' picket team, we initially used clubs, and later acquired some "Hanyang" rifles. With these clubs and "Hanyang" rifles, we reclaimed the British concession. But just as we had taken up the guns and made the enemy tremble, China's Khrushchev was also terrified. He hurriedly issued orders and gave speeches, forcing the workers' picket teams to hand over their weapons to the Kuomintang and ordering the dissolution of the workers' picket teams. At that time, the union members and picket team members were furious. Many comrades angrily said, this is not about handing over guns, this is about taking our lives! Handing over the guns to the Kuomintang is like tying our heads to the enemy's belt. Sure enough, after "handing over the guns," the enemy began the massacre. The thriving workers' movement was thus betrayed by China's Khrushchev.

An old retired worker and former member of the workers' picket team, Chen Baoji, aged 75, said: This old traitor, China's Khrushchev, at every historical stage of the Chinese revolution and at every critical turning point, has always pursued a reactionary bourgeois line of opposing the revolution and selling out the interests of the people. He not only ordered the workers' picket teams to hand over their weapons to the enemy in the early 1920s; at the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he wanted to hand over more than 120,000 troops to the enemy; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, this China's Khrushchev desperately wanted to develop capitalism, relying on capitalists to develop industry in cities and promoting the rich peasant economy of "three horses and one plow" in the countryside, trying to drag us back to the old capitalist road and suffer again. Chairman Mao teaches us, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." Now, it is time to settle accounts with this great traitor!

Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command the gun, we can firmly grasp the gun.

In the study and discussion sessions, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat in Wuhan and the stationed soldiers have gained a deeper understanding of the focus of the struggle between the two lines, which is always the issue of power. The key to the issue of power lies in which class holds the gun. Only by firmly grasping the gun and using Mao Zedong Thought to command the gun can we firmly grasp the gun.

The fighters from revolutionary organizations such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Bureau," "Steel 913," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance" reviewed the historical experiences and lessons. They pointed out: During the Great Revolution period, the workers' movement and armed struggle in the Wuhan area flourished under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. However, China's Khrushchev betrayed the revolution, surrendered weapons to the enemy, and handed over thousands of guns, which were exchanged with the blood of martyrs, to the Kuomintang. "Surrendering weapons" was a bad thing, but it also educated our revolutionary forerunners. They learned from Chairman Mao's teachings in the sharp and complex class struggle: "In China, without armed struggle, the proletariat has no position, the people have no position, the Communist Party has no position, and there is no victory for the revolution." It was precisely because our revolutionary forerunners increasingly grasped Mao Zedong Thought that, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, China's Khrushchev's dream of exchanging the proletariat's gun for the Kuomintang government's official hat was completely shattered. Today, the great practice of the Cultural Revolution has once again taught us that we must use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Otherwise, the gun and the printing press, which are already in our hands, still have the danger of being lost. We, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat and the broad masses of stationed soldiers, have relied on Mao Zedong Thought to quickly and thoroughly smash the enemy's desperate struggles and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The soldiers from the unit where Huang Jiguang served before his death have a deeper understanding of using Mao Zedong Thought to command the gun to firmly grasp the gun. They believe that Huang Jiguang, the martyr, used his body to block the enemy's gun muzzle on Ganggangling, opening up the road to victory for his comrades. The soldiers of our army created a rare miracle in the history of warfare on the barren Ganggangling, all thanks to the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the unprecedented Cultural Revolution, every achievement of the People's Liberation Army's "supporting the left" work is also a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers said: Precisely because we have used Mao Zedong Thought to command the gun, at the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines in Wuhan, we firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and, together with the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, resolutely crushed the desperate counterattacks of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, defending the victory of the Cultural Revolution. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to command the gun for life, forever preserving the proletarian iron mountain without changing color for thousands of generations.

Thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and uproot this greatest evil.

In the process of study and criticism, the broad masses of revolutionary fighters of the proletariat and the soldiers of the Liberation Army deeply realized: The bourgeois headquarters of China's Khrushchev is the most dangerous enemy and the greatest harm to our proletarian dictatorship, and it must be thoroughly smashed. Not only must this bourgeois headquarters be smashed organizationally, but it must also be thoroughly smashed politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Many fighters from revolutionary organizations have, through analyzing the class struggle situation in Wuhan, increasingly deeply realized the importance of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters politically, ideologically, and theoretically. They said, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Wuhan, from an organizational perspective, have long been pulled down and exposed to the public, but these guys are unwilling to perish. They manipulated the masses in the "Million Heroes" who were deceived, directing the spearhead towards the proletarian headquarters, and orchestrated the extremely serious Wuhan political incident. Now, their reactionary faces have been even more exposed, and this handful of bad guys have become rats that everyone wants to beat in the streets. We must press on with our victory, pursue and attack relentlessly, seriously and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary true face of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize them deeply and thoroughly, overthrow and disgrace them, making them infamous for eternity and become a pile of dog shit that is despised by humanity.

    中国赫鲁晓夫是中国工人阶级的最大叛徒
    武汉军民清算这个老机会主义分子四十年前勒令工人纠察队向国民党交枪的罪行
    据新华社武汉二十一日电　党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派四十年前在武汉背叛工人阶级、出卖革命、勒令工人纠察队向国民党交枪的滔天罪行，今天在武汉地区无产阶级革命派和驻军指战员开展的革命大批判的新高潮中，得到了彻底清算。
   党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是工人阶级的大叛徒，是中国人民不共戴天的死敌
    武汉地区大革命时期的一些老工会会员和工人纠察队员，最近纷纷揭发控诉党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派当年勒令他们向国民党交枪的罪行。四十年来，他们从没忘掉这个老牌机会主义分子、修正主义分子背叛革命、出卖工人的滔天大罪，今天是彻底清算他的罪恶的时候了。
    当年的工人纠察队员、老装卸工钟恒山在一次座谈会上说：旧社会我们工人阶级的苦难真是写不尽，说不完，可是，正当我们工人组织起纠察队，拿起枪杆子同敌人斗争的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫竟逼令我们把枪交给了敌人。这个老反革命还反对我们工人夺取政权，胡说什么“以中国现在的情势看来，这样幼稚的无产阶级当然说不上马上就拿来实行。既是很远的事实，也用不着说很多的话来讨论它。”这些话，真把我的肺都气炸了！就在一九二七年，我们刚一组织起来，武装起来，就打败了老牌帝国主义，收回了英租界，把帝国主义、封建军阀打得落花流水，这个革命行动大长了中国工人阶级的志气，大灭了帝国主义的威风，难道这是我们“幼稚”吗？中国的赫鲁晓夫站在反动的资产阶级立场上，根本看不见伟大的工人阶级的力量，所以才这么胡说八道！
    一位曾经参加过工人纠察队的老海员，怀着对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的无比愤怒说，毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”，枪杆子就是我们工人阶级的命根子。有了枪杆子就有了一切，丧失了枪杆子就丧失了一切。当初，我们工人个个赤手空拳，没有武器，我们整天想的是武装，要的是武装，为的是无产阶级政权。有了武装才能有政权，有了武装才能翻身。我们武汉工人纠察队成立之后，起初用木棒，后来，搞了一些“汉阳造”步枪，就凭这些木棒和“汉阳造”，收回了英租界。可是，就在我们刚刚拿起枪杆子使敌人丧魂落魄的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫也被吓得六神无主了。他急急忙忙下通令，作报告，强迫我们工人纠察队把枪交给国民党，勒令解散工人纠察队。当时，我们工会会员、纠察队员真是怒火万丈。许多同志愤怒地说，这那里是交枪，这是要我们的命啊！把枪交给国民党，就是把我们的脑袋拴到敌人的腰带上。果然，“交枪”后不久，敌人就开始了大屠杀。轰轰烈烈的工人运动，就这样被中国的赫鲁晓夫出卖了。
    当年的工人纠察队员、七十五岁的退休老工人陈宝记说：中国赫鲁晓夫这个老叛徒，在中国革命发展的各个历史阶段，在革命转变的各个关键时刻，他都是推行一条反对革命、出卖人民利益的资产阶级反动路线。他不但在二十年代初期就勒令我们工人纠察队把枪交给敌人；到抗战胜利时，他又要把一百二十多万的人民军队双手交给敌人；中华人民共和国成立后，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫又拚命要发展资本主义，城市里要依靠资本家发展工业，农村要发展“三马一犁”的富农经济，硬要我们退回到资本主义老路上去，再受一遍苦。毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”现在，已经到了和这个大叛徒算总账的时候了！
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅枪杆子，才能牢牢掌握枪杆子
    在学习座谈中，武汉地区无产阶级革命派战士和驻军指战员，对两条路线斗争的集中点，始终是一个政权问题，而政权问题的关键，又在于哪个阶级掌握枪杆子，有了进一步的认识。他们从自己亲身经历中深深体会到：一定要牢牢掌握枪杆子，一定要用毛泽东思想统帅枪杆子；只有用毛泽东思想统帅枪杆子，才能牢牢掌握枪杆子。
      “钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命组织的战士，回顾了革命历史上的经验教训。他们指出：大革命时期，武汉地区的工人运动和工人武装，是在毛泽东思想指引下蓬勃发展起来的。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫竟然背叛革命，交枪媚敌，把几千枝用先烈生命换来的枪交给了国民党。“交枪”是坏事，但这也教育了我们的革命先辈们，他们在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，千遍万遍地学习毛主席的教导：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”正是由于革命先辈们越来越多地掌握了毛泽东思想，抗日战争胜利后，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图拿无产阶级枪杆子去换国民党政府的乌纱帽的迷梦，就彻底破产了。今天，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践又一次教育了我们，必须用毛泽东思想统帅一切。不然，已经握在手中的枪杆子、印把子，仍有丢掉的危险。我们无产阶级革命派和驻军广大指战员一起，就是靠毛泽东思想，迅速彻底粉碎了敌人的垂死挣扎，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    黄继光生前所在连的指战员们，对毛泽东思想统帅枪杆子才能牢牢握紧枪杆子，体会得更深刻。他们认为，黄继光烈士在上甘岭上用身体堵着敌人的枪口，为战友开辟了胜利前进的道路，我军指战员在一片焦土的上甘岭上能创造出战争史上少有的奇迹，都是靠伟大的毛泽东思想。在当前史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军“支左”工作取得的每一个成绩也都是毛泽东思想的胜利。战士们说：正是因为我们用毛泽东思想统帅了枪杆子，所以，在武汉地区两条路线斗争的关键时刻，我们坚定地站到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和无产阶级革命派一起，坚决粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉代理人的疯狂反扑，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。我们一定要一辈子用毛泽东思想统帅枪杆子，千秋万代永保无产阶级的铁打江山不变颜色。
    彻底粉碎资产阶级司令部，挖掉这个最大的祸根
    广大无产阶级革命派战士和解放军指战员在学习和大批判的过程中深刻认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫的这个资产阶级司令部，是我们无产阶级专政最危险的敌人，最大的祸害，必须彻底砸烂它。不仅要从组织上砸烂这个资产阶级司令部，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底砸烂这个司令部。
    许多革命组织的战士从分析武汉地区阶级斗争的形势中，越来越深刻地认识到从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的重要意义。他们说，武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从组织上说早就拉下了马，被揪出来示众了，但这些家伙不甘心灭亡，他们又操纵“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众，把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，一手策划了极端严重的武汉政治事件。现在，他们的反动面目已经更加暴露，这一小撮坏家伙在群众中已成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。我们必须乘胜追击，穷追猛打，认真地、深入地开展革命的大批判，彻底揭露中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉代理人的反革命真面目，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深、批透，斗倒、斗臭，叫他们遗臭万年，成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
