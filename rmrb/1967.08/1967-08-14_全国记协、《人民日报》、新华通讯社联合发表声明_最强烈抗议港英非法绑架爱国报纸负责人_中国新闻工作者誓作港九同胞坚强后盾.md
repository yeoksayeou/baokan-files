The National Journalists Association of China, *People's Daily*, and Xinhua News Agency jointly issued a statement today, strongly protesting the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong's illegal abduction of the leaders of three patriotic newspapers and a printing company manager.

The full text of the joint statement is as follows:

The Hong Kong British fascist authorities, disregarding the condemnation of public opinion from the great Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, continue to carry out maddened suppression and persecution against our patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong. Following the unreasonable arrest of 14 patriotic journalists in Hong Kong, including Xu Yuncheng and Xue Ping, at dawn on August 9, they illegally abducted Hu Diqiu, the publisher of *Hong Kong Night News*, Pan Huaiwei, the publisher of *Tianfeng Daily*, and Chen Yanjuan, the supervisor of printing for the same newspaper, Li Shaoxiong, the chairman of the board of Nanchang Printing Company, which prints these three newspapers, and Zhai Nuanhui, the manager of Nanchang Printing Company. The Hong Kong British authorities are also using so-called "legal" means to persecute the *Ta Kung Pao* and *Jing Bao* in Hong Kong on charges of "defamation." The National Journalists Association of China, *People's Daily*, and Xinhua News Agency once again strongly protest the fascist barbaric acts of the Hong Kong British authorities!

Under the brilliant guidance of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great encouragement of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland, our broad patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon fear no violence, bravely advance, and wage unyielding struggles against the savage suppression and persecution by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities. They have shown the great revolutionary spirit of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Now, the anti-British and anti-violence struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon is growing in momentum, their fighting spirit is soaring, their experience is becoming richer, and their combat effectiveness is becoming stronger. In this great anti-imperialist struggle, the patriotic newspapers and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood in the forefront of the struggle with a revolutionary fighting posture, and made outstanding contributions in mobilizing and organizing the masses and exposing and striking the enemy. It is precisely because of this that the Hong Kong British fascist authorities are terrified and hateful, continually expanding their savage persecution of the patriotic newspapers and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong, in an attempt to suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought, to extinguish the flames of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and to save their dying fate. We solemnly warn the Hong Kong British authorities: you have completely miscalculated! The voice of truth cannot be stifled, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be suppressed, and the patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon cannot be crushed or frightened by any reactionary forces. Your various persecutions against our patriotic compatriots, patriotic newspapers, and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon will not only fail to save your dying fate in the slightest, but will instead arouse greater anger and hatred from the patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and incite them to wage broader and more resolute struggles, thereby accelerating your doom.

We warn the Hong Kong British authorities: you have used your own bloody hands to tear apart the tattered cover of your so-called "democracy" and "freedom," and thus completely exposed your extremely ugly fascist imperialist true face in front of the people of the world. You will definitely not escape the just judgment of the revolutionary people of the world!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." Your savage attacks on the patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong are precisely the manifestations of the last struggles of the reactionary forces that are about to perish. The more reactionary, the more rampant, and the more ferocious you are, the closer you are to death, and the sooner the day of people's victory will come. You will eventually taste the iron fist of the Chinese people!

We, the Chinese journalists, together with the 700 million people of the entire nation, solemnly pledge to be the strong backing of the patriotic compatriots and patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon, resolutely support the just struggle of the patriotic journalists in Hong Kong and Kowloon, until the final victory!

We warn the Hong Kong British fascist authorities: the patriotic newspapers in Hong Kong and Kowloon have the sacred right to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought and the anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle of the patriotic compatriots. This right is absolutely inviolable! The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately stop the white terror, immediately stop the attacks on patriotic newspapers, immediately release all the arrested patriotic journalists and other patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, compensate for all the losses they have suffered, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, all the serious consequences that arise from this will be your complete responsibility.

    全国记协、《人民日报》、新华通讯社联合发表声明
    最强烈抗议港英非法绑架爱国报纸负责人
    中国新闻工作者誓作港九同胞坚强后盾
    新华社十二日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会、《人民日报》、新华通讯社今天联合发表声明，强烈抗议香港英国当局非法绑架《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》、《香港商报》三家爱国报纸的负责人和南昌印务公司负责人的法西斯暴行。
    联合声明全文如下：
    港英法西斯当局不顾伟大的中国人民和全世界革命人民的舆论谴责，对我香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者继续进行疯狂的镇压和迫害，继无理逮捕港九爱国记者许云程、薛平等共十四人以后，八月九日凌晨又非法绑架《香港夜报》社长胡棣周、《田丰日报》社长潘怀伟和督印人陈艳娟、《香港商报》督印人兼承印这三家报纸的南昌印务公司董事长李少雄，和南昌印务公司经理翟暖晖等五人。港英当局还利用所谓“法律”手段，准备以“诽谤罪”迫害香港《大公报》和《晶报》。中华全国新闻工作者协会、《人民日报》和新华通讯社对港英当局的这种法西斯野蛮暴行，再一次提出最严重、最强烈的抗议！
    我广大港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在祖国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的巨大鼓舞下，不畏强暴，前赴后继，对港英法西斯当局的野蛮镇压和迫害，进行了英勇不屈的斗争，表现了中华民族优秀儿女大无畏的革命精神。现在，港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的声势越来越大，斗志越来越昂扬，经验越来越丰富，战斗力越来越强大。在这场伟大的反帝斗争中，香港爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以革命的战斗姿态，始终站在斗争的最前列，在动员和组织群众、揭露和打击敌人方面作出了卓越的贡献。正因为这样，港英法西斯当局怕得要死，恨得要命，不断扩大对香港爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者的野蛮迫害，妄图压制伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，妄图扑灭港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的烈火，挽救它垂死的命运。我们严正警告港英当局：你们完全打错了算盘！真理的声音是窒息不了的，毛泽东思想是压制不了的，香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者是任何反动力量也压不垮、吓不倒的，你们对我港九爱国同胞、爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者的种种迫害，非但不能一丝一毫地挽救你们灭亡的命运，相反只能激起港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者更大的愤怒和仇恨，激起他们更广泛、更坚决的斗争，从而加速你们的灭亡。
    我们警告港英当局：你们已用自己的血手，把你们支离破碎的所谓“民主”、“自由”的遮羞布撕得精光，从而在全世界人民面前彻底暴露了你们极端丑恶的法西斯帝国主义真面目。你们一定逃脱不了全世界革命人民的正义审判！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。你们对香港爱国同胞、爱国新闻工作者的猖狂进攻，就是将要灭亡的反动势力最后挣扎的表现。你们愈反动、愈猖獗、愈张牙舞爪，就说明你们愈加接近死亡，说明人民胜利的日子快要到来了。你们终将尝到中国人民铁拳的味道！
    我们中国新闻工作者和全国七亿人民一起，誓作港九爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者的坚强后盾，坚决支持港九爱国新闻工作者的正义斗争，直到最后胜利！
    我们警告港英法西斯当局：港九爱国报纸宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，宣传爱国同胞的反帝抗暴斗争，是他们的神圣权利，这个权利绝对不容侵犯！港英当局必须立即停止白色恐怖，立即停止向爱国报纸的进攻，立即释放所有被捕的港九爱国新闻工作者和其他港九爱国同胞，赔偿他们所受到的一切损失，保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，由你们负完全责任。
