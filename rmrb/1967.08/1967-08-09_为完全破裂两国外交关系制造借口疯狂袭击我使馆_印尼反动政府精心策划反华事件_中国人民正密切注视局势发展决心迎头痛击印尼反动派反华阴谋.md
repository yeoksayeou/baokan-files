For completely severing the diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Indonesian reactionary government has meticulously planned an anti-China incident and launched a frenzied attack on our embassy. The Chinese people are closely monitoring the developments and are determined to strike back at the Indonesian reactionary clique's anti-China conspiracy.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 8, our correspondent reports: The Indonesian reactionary military police and more than a thousand rioters launched a frenzied attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on the morning of August 5. This is an extremely serious incident meticulously planned by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime to completely sever diplomatic relations between the two countries and further instigate a large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese wave. After the incident, this fascist military regime fabricated rumors and turned the tables, further inciting anti-China sentiments. The conspiracy activities of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime before and after this serious incident must be thoroughly exposed.

On the morning of August 5, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime mobilized more than a thousand reactionary military police and rioters to storm the Chinese Embassy, firing guns and setting fire to the embassy buildings. Four embassy staff members were injured, and the great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao's portrait, was publicly destroyed, along with the Chinese national emblem. This heinous crime has added another bloody debt! Even the official mouthpiece of the Indonesian government, the Antara News Agency, had to admit that the rioters belonging to the reactionary "Five Principles of the Founding of the Nation Front" and the "Ansor Youth Organization" "rushed into the (Chinese) embassy, looted items inside the embassy, and destroyed or burned everything they saw." However, at noon on August 5, when our acting charge d'affaires in Indonesia, Lü Zibao, went to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge the strongest protest against this serious incident, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials actually turned the tables, claiming that the Chinese embassy staff had shot and injured four of their people. The right-wing newspaper in Jakarta, "Hope Light," quoted the deputy chief of staff of the Fifth Military Region as saying: "Three demonstrators and one member of the assault team were shot and injured, and the direction of the bullets came from inside, so it is highly likely that it was not the national forces (referring to the Indonesian reactionary military) that opened fire." The mouthpiece of American imperialism, the Associated Press, also bolstered the morale of its anti-China lackey, the Indonesian reactionary clique, accusing the Chinese embassy staff of "shooting at university students attempting to loot the building. A soldier and three youths were injured."

Our acting charge d'affaires in Indonesia, Lü Zibao, sternly pointed out at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the claim that the Chinese embassy staff opened fire and injured people is completely fabricated. Lü Zibao lodged a strong protest against the Indonesian reactionary government's tactics of spreading rumors and lies and playing tricks.

The truth of the matter is as follows:

To create a pretext for attacking the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime issued an "order" on June 17, forcing the removal of walls higher than one and a half meters in Jakarta. The Indonesian reactionary authorities, on the one hand, spread the word that foreign embassies have diplomatic immunity, and on the other hand, suddenly notified the Chinese Embassy on August 1 to unreasonably demand the removal of the embassy walls. According to reports, on July 31, a group of rioters met with the Fifth Military Region Commander Amir to plot the attack on the Chinese Embassy and destroy the Chinese Embassy walls. On the morning of August 5, before attacking the Chinese Embassy, the rioters were taken to the military camp to receive their mission. Subsequently, the rioters rammed into the Chinese Embassy with trucks to commit crimes, and the Indonesian reactionary military also arrived in armored vehicles in front of the Chinese Embassy to participate in this atrocity. On the spot, someone witnessed that when the rioters were committing crimes inside the Chinese Embassy, some rioters waved to an Indonesian reactionary soldier, who then ordered the reactionary military to fire hundreds of bullets into the air and at the rioters' ranks, intentionally injuring a few rioters. The facts prove that the Indonesian reactionary military police and rioters attacked the Chinese Embassy on August 5, completely according to a pre-arranged plan. They had decided in advance that after rushing into the Chinese Embassy, they would shoot and injure their own people and then falsely accuse the Chinese Embassy of opening fire and injuring people.

The facts are as follows. According to the pre-arranged plan, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime mobilized a large number of reactionary military police and rioters to attack the Chinese Embassy, injuring Chinese embassy staff and shooting a few rioters to create a pretext for completely severing diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia and further instigating a new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment. To achieve anti-China and anti-Chinese goals, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime resorted to such despicable and shameless tricks, which can only further expose its ugly face as a lackey of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism in front of the Indonesian people and the people of the world.

The Chinese people are closely monitoring the movements of the Indonesian reactionary clique and are determined to strike back at all anti-China and anti-Chinese conspiracies planned by the Indonesian reactionary clique. The great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The extremely reactionary and internally and externally besieged Indonesian Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is such a reactionary group. No matter how much they disrupt and sabotage, they will ultimately fail completely and be wiped out.

### 为完全破裂两国外交关系制造借口疯狂袭击我使馆  印尼反动政府精心策划反华事件  中国人民正密切注视局势发展决心迎头痛击印尼反动派反华阴谋

    为完全破裂两国外交关系制造借口疯狂袭击我使馆
    印尼反动政府精心策划反华事件
    中国人民正密切注视局势发展决心迎头痛击印尼反动派反华阴谋
    据新华社八日讯　本社记者报道：印度尼西亚反动军警和暴徒一千多人五日上午疯狂袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，这是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为了完全破裂两国外交关系、进一步掀起大规模反华排华逆流而精心策划的一次极端严重的事件。事件发生后，这个法西斯军人政权又制造谣言，反咬一口，进一步煽动反华情绪。对于苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在这一严重事件的前后所玩弄的阴谋活动，必须予以彻底揭穿。
    五日上午，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权调动一千多名反动军警和暴徒鸣枪冲进中国大使馆，纵火焚烧大使馆建筑物，打伤四名使馆人员，公然毁坏中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的挂像，砸毁中国国徽，犯下了滔天罪行，欠下了又一笔血债！连印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社也不得不承认，属于反动的“建国五项原则阵线”和“安索尔青年团”的暴徒们“冲进（中国）大使馆以后，抢掠了大使馆内的东西，破坏甚至焚烧了他们见到的一切”。但是，五日中午，当我国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波前往印尼外交部就这一严重事件提出最最强烈抗议时，印尼外交部官员竟倒打一耙，说什么中国大使馆人员开枪打伤了他们四个人。雅加达右派报纸《希望之光报》当天援引雅加达第五军区副参谋长的话说：“有三位示威者和一名突击部队成员中弹受伤，子弹的方向来自里面，因此有很大可能不是国家工具（指印尼反动军队——编者注）开的枪。”美帝国主义的喉舌美联社也为它的反华走狗印尼反动派壮胆助威，诬蔑中国大使馆人员“向企图抢劫这座建筑物的大学生开枪。一名士兵和三名青年人受伤。”
    我国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波在印尼外交部严正指出：所谓中国使馆人员开枪伤人，完全是捏造。吕子波对印尼反动政府这种造谣撒谎、玩弄阴谋的手法提出强烈抗议。
    这件事情的真相如下：
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为袭击中国驻印尼大使馆制造借口，曾于六月十七日发布了一项“命令”，强行规定拆除雅加达市内建筑物高度在一米半以上的围墙。印尼反动当局一方面放出空气说，外国大使馆有外交豁免权，另一方面又于八月一日突然照会中国大使馆，无理要求中国使馆把围墙拆掉。据报道，七月三十一日，一群暴徒与第五军区司令阿米尔会面，密谋袭击中国大使馆，并捣毁中国大使馆围墙。五日上午，在袭击中国大使馆之前，暴徒们曾被带到军营接受任务。随后，暴徒们用卡车撞进中国大使馆行凶，印尼反动军队也乘装甲车开到中国大使馆前，参与这次暴行。当场有人目睹：当暴徒们在中国大使馆院内行凶时，有的暴徒曾向一名印尼反动军人挥手示意，这个军人随即下令反动军队向空中和暴徒们的队伍开枪射击二、三百发子弹，故意打伤了几个暴徒。事实证明，印尼反动军警和暴徒五日袭击中国大使馆，完全是按照事先制订的计划行事的。他们事先就决定冲进中国大使馆后，开枪打伤自己人，并反诬是中国使馆开枪伤人。
    事实就是这样。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权按照事前的策划，出动大批反动军警和暴徒袭击中国大使馆，打伤中国大使馆人员，并开枪打伤几名暴徒，为完全破裂中国和印尼外交关系、进一步掀起反华排华新高潮制造借口。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为了反华排华，竟然采取这种卑鄙无耻的伎俩，只能在印尼人民和全世界人民面前进一步暴露它充当美帝苏修反华走卒的丑恶嘴脸。
    中国人民正在密切注视着印尼反动派的动向，并决心迎头痛击印尼反动派策划的一切反华排华阴谋。中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”反动透顶、内外交困的印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，就是这样一伙反动派。不管他们怎样捣乱破坏，到头来必将彻底失败，直至灭亡。
