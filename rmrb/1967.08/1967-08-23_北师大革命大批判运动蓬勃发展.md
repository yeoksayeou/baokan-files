Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Beijing Normal University has launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. The resolute and united fighters of Mount Jinggang and the broad revolutionary faculty and students, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcome various interferences, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a comprehensive attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party from the political, military, educational, and cultural fronts. They have also combined the criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units, creating a good situation for revolutionary criticism.

The first sign of the good situation in the revolutionary criticism at Beijing Normal University is that the broad revolutionary faculty and students have sat down, studied hard, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary criticism. The university's revolutionary committee emphasized that the criticism must highlight politics and Mao Zedong Thought; it must first grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, the "four firsts," and the correct attitude towards the criticism, and resolutely solve various practical ideological issues in the criticism.

At the beginning of the criticism, some revolutionary faculty and students did not fully understand the great significance of revolutionary criticism. Some thought that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party had already been exposed and were "dead tigers" with nothing more to do. Some students could not sit still and wanted to join the revolutionary forces in other places. They had little interest in the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units, thinking "fight distant battles, not nearby ones; fight big battles, not small ones; fight living tigers, not dead ones." Some thought they could not write high-quality criticism articles and preferred to go to other places for a good fight.

In response to these practical ideological issues, the revolutionary committees at the university and department levels, along with the class revolutionary committees, organized the revolutionary faculty and students to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and the May 16 Notification issued by the Central Committee in 1966. They also studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution." Through study, discussion, and various activities, the revolutionary faculty and students deepened their hatred for the class enemy and realized that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party were paper tigers, not dead tigers. Only by criticizing them deeply, thoroughly, and completely in politics, ideology, and theory, and by thoroughly eliminating the revisionist poison they spread on various fronts, could they prevent the restoration of capitalism. Without revolutionary criticism, it would be like releasing tigers back into the mountains and showing mercy to evil people, which would not be highly responsible to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They also realized that the current situation was very different from a year ago and that they should not always think about going out. Currently, the most effective support for revolutionary comrades nationwide was to carry out revolutionary criticism well. Revolutionary criticism was not "nothing to do" but a serious, meticulous class struggle that was decisive for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. This required everyone to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works diligently, better carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters in politics, ideology, and theory. Everyone agreed that carrying out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters was the most important political task and national affair at present. The attitude towards criticism was the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. True proletarian revolutionaries must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and actively participate in revolutionary criticism.

After unifying their ideological understanding, the revolutionary faculty and students at Beijing Normal University established various criticism groups and seriously studied Chairman Mao's works on party building, military affairs, literature and art, education, and other aspects. They used these works to criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party on these fronts.

The second sign of the good situation in the revolutionary criticism at Beijing Normal University is that the broad masses have truly been mobilized.

They criticized Khrushchev's "Modesty" in late May, started criticizing the counter-revolutionary literary and artistic black line in June, criticized the revisionist educational line in July, and began criticizing the revisionist political line, party-building line, and bourgeois military line in August. The broad revolutionary faculty and students carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, bravely fought, feared no fatigue, and fought continuously, launching one campaign after another, making the criticism wave higher and higher. They used Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest weapon, to launch a comprehensive criticism of the bourgeois headquarters. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, conducted detailed investigations and research, and deeply analyzed and criticized. Batch after batch of big-character posters for criticism, one after another struggle, criticism, and reform linkage meetings, and one after another study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works pushed the criticism at Beijing Normal University to a new stage. During the criticism of the revisionist educational line, many revolutionary faculty and students went to factories, rural areas, and primary and secondary schools to understand the workers' and poor peasants' requirements for educational revolution and investigate the class struggle on the educational front.

Many revolutionary teachers seriously summarized the lessons of the great reversal in the educational revolution in 1962 and exposed the crimes of the revisionist educational line through their personal experiences. To deeply criticize the old educational system, the teachers and revolutionary students from the Education Department, History Department, and several science departments jointly compiled "The History of the Development of the Chinese Educational System" and "The History of the Development of the World Educational System." The students from the Political Education Department and the staff from the Academic Affairs Office jointly compiled "The History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines on the Educational Front in the Past 17 Years." In this criticism, the broad revolutionary faculty and students received vivid and profound education on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the proletarian revolutionary forces were continuously consolidated and expanded.

The third sign of the good situation in the revolutionary criticism at Beijing Normal University is that the targets of the struggle are concentrated, and the criticism has begun to combine with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units.

The revolutionary faculty and students at Beijing Normal University repeatedly studied the great historical document personally drafted by Chairman Mao—the May 16 Notification, seriously understood Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and deeply felt that concentrating the targets and overthrowing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party was the direction of the struggle in the Cultural Revolution. All the revolutionary faculty and students in the school directed their struggle at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In the criticism, the revolutionary faculty and students at Beijing Normal University also firmly grasped the key issues of the bourgeois headquarters, analyzed and criticized the revisionist ideological system, and dealt a fatal blow to the bourgeois headquarters.

The criticism at Beijing Normal University has begun to combine with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the school. The revolutionary faculty and students in each department exposed the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party at Beijing Normal University in implementing the revisionist educational line, counter-revolutionary literary and artistic black line, and revisionist party-building and organizational lines, and exposed the various crimes of the bourgeois intellectuals ruling Beijing Normal University.

They were determined not to disappoint the expectations of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the comrades of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and were resolved to be pioneers in the educational revolution. Thoroughly smashing the old educational system and creating a new educational system for the proletariat had become the common struggle goal of all the revolutionary faculty and students in the school.

The fourth sign of the good situation in the revolutionary criticism at Beijing Normal University is that the revolutionary criticism has promoted and consolidated the great alliance of revolution.

Many facts have proven that the departments and classes with good great alliances have played a strong fighting role in the criticism. In turn, the revolutionary criticism has promoted and strengthened the great alliance of revolution. For example, the revolutionary faculty and students in the Physics Department achieved the great alliance of revolution and the "three-in-one combination" in the criticism and established the department's revolutionary committee. Once the committee was established, it grasped the revolutionary criticism, and the entire department saw a new high tide of criticism. The students said: "Once the direction is clear, the idea of fighting internal wars decreases. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, we can promote and consolidate the great alliance of revolution in politics and ideology."

Currently, the revolutionary faculty and students at Beijing Normal University are combining the study of the decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee on the anti-party clique headed by Peng Dehuai, severely criticizing the bourgeois military line, and further studying and understanding Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and military line. They expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "it is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu," to actively respond to the recent call by Vice Chairman Lin Biao to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, to carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end, and to continue to achieve new merits and create new labor for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    北师大革命大批判运动蓬勃发展
    在解放军帮助下，用毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判，切实解决大批判中的活思想，充分发动群众，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，把革命大批判推向了新高潮。
    本报讯　本报记者述评：在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，北京师范大学掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。坚强团结的井冈山战士和广大革命师生，在人民解放军的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除种种干扰，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以毛泽东思想为武器，从政治、军事、教育、文艺等各条战线上，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起了总攻击，并且把大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来，出现了革命大批判的大好形势。
      以毛泽东思想统帅大批判
    师大革命大批判形势大好的第一个标志是：广大革命师生，坐得住，学得进，用得较活，把革命的大批判当作活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判。
    师大校革命委员会强调大批判必须突出政治，突出毛泽东思想；抓大批判首先要狠抓毛主席著作的学习，狠抓“四个第一”，狠抓端正对大批判的态度，切实解决大批判中各种活的思想问题。
    大批判刚开始的时候，部分革命师生对于革命大批判的伟大意义认识不足。有的认为，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经揪了出来，已经是“死老虎”，没有多少搞头。有的师生坐不住，想去同外地的革命派并肩战斗。他们对本单位的斗批改没有多少兴趣，有“搞远不搞近，搞大不搞小，打活老虎不打死老虎”的想法，还有的认为，自己写不出高质量的批判文章，还不如到外地痛痛快快干一场。
    针对这些活思想，校、系两级革命委员会和班文革小组结合当前文化大革命形势，组织革命师生认真学习毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》、《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》、中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，学习毛主席关于“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的指示。通过学习讨论和开展各种活动，革命师生更加增加了对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，比较深刻地认识到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是纸老虎，但还不是什么死老虎。只有把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，把他们在各条战线散布的修正主义流毒彻底肃清，才能防止资本主义复辟。不进行革命的大批判，就是放虎归山，就是怜悯恶人，就不是对无产阶级革命事业高度负责。他们还认识到，现在的形势和一年前大不相同了，不能老想往外跑，在当前只有搞好革命的大批判，才是从根本上对全国革命战友的最有力的支援。革命的大批判，绝不是“没有什么搞头”，而是一场艰苦、严肃、细致的阶级斗争，对文化大革命的彻底胜利有决定性的意义。这就要求大家坐下来刻苦学习毛主席著作，更好地发扬革命造反精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。大家认为，开展革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，是当前最大的政治，是当前最大的国家大事。对待大批判的态度，就是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度，对待无产阶级文化大革命的态度。真正的无产阶级革命派一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，积极投入革命的大批判。
    在思想认识统一以后，师大革命师生纷纷成立了各种批判小组，认真学习毛主席关于建党、建军、文艺、教育等各方面的著作，用来批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在这些战线上推行修正主义路线的罪行。
    广大群众真正发动起来了
    师大革命大批判形势大好的第二个标志是：广大群众真正发动起来了。
    他们在五月下旬批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》，六月开始批判反革命文艺黑线，七月批判修正主义教育路线，八月开始批判修正主义政治路线、建党路线和资产阶级军事路线。广大革命师生发扬不断革命精神，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，一个战役接着一个战役，使大批判一浪高过一浪。他们运用毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，向资产阶级司令部展开了全面的大批判。他们认真地学习毛主席著作，细致地进行调查研究，深入地进行分析批判。一批批大批判的大字报，一个个斗批改的串连会，一次次学习毛主席著作的讲用会，把师大的大批判推进到一个新阶段。在批判修正主义教育路线时，许多革命师生还到工厂、农村和中小学去，了解工人、贫下中农对教育革命的要求，调查教育战线的阶级斗争。
    许多革命教师认真总结了一九六二年教育革命大反复的教训，用自己的切身感受揭露了修正主义教育路线的罪恶。为了深入批判旧教育制度，教育系、历史系以及好些理科系的革命教师和革命小将一起着手编写《中国教育制度发展史》和《世界教育制度发展史》，政教系的同学和教务处的干部共同编写了《十七年来教育战线两条路线斗争史》。在这场大批判中，广大革命师生受到了生动深刻的毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的教育，无产阶级革命队伍不断巩固和壮大。
    大批判同本单位斗批改结合起来
    师大革命大批判形势大好的第三个标志是：斗争目标集中，并且开始同本单位的斗批改结合起来。
    师大的革命师生反复学习了毛主席亲手制定的伟大历史文件——五·一六《通知》，认真领会毛主席的战略部署，深深感到：集中目标，打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是文化大革命的斗争大方向。全校革命师生都把斗争矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。师大革命师生在大批判中，还紧紧抓住资产阶级司令部的要害问题，针对修正主义的思想体系进行分析批判，给资产阶级司令部以致命的打击。
    师大的大批判已经开始和本校的斗批改结合起来。各个系的革命师生都揭露了师大党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在师大执行修正主义教育路线、反革命文艺黑线以及修正主义建党路线、组织路线的罪行，揭发了资产阶级知识分子统治师大的种种罪恶。
    他们决心不辜负毛主席、党中央、中央文革小组同志的期望，在教育革命方面立志做一名探索者。彻底砸烂旧的教育制度，创造无产阶级的新教育体系，已经成为全校革命师生的共同斗争目标。
    大批判推进了革命的大联合
    师大革命大批判形势大好的第四个标志是：革命的大批判推进和巩固了革命的大联合。
    许多事实证明，大联合较好的系和班级，在大批判中发挥了很强的战斗力。而革命的大批判，反过来又促进和加强了革命的大联合。例如，物理系的革命师生，在大批判中实现了革命的大联合和“三结合”，成立了系革命委员会。革委会一成立，就狠抓革命的大批判，全系出现了大批判的新高潮。同学们说：“大方向抓准了，打‘内战’的想法就少了。只要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握住斗争的大方向，就能从政治上、思想上促进和巩固革命的大联合。”
    现在，师大的革命师生正结合学习党的八届八中全会关于以彭德怀为首的反党集团的决议，狠批资产阶级军事路线，进一步学习和领会毛主席的人民战争思想和建军路线。他们表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，一定要积极响应最近林彪副主席的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召，发扬彻底革命的精神，把革命的大批判进行到底，继续为无产阶级文化大革命建新功，立新劳。
