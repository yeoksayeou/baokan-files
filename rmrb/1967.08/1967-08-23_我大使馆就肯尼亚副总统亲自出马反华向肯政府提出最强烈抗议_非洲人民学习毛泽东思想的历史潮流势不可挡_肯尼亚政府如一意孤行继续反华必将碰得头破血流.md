The Chinese Embassy in Kenya has lodged the strongest protest to the Kenyan government over the vice president's personal involvement in anti-China activities. The historical trend of African people studying Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. If the Kenyan government insists on continuing its anti-China stance, it will surely face severe consequences.

New China News Agency, August 22: Nairobi - The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Kenya submitted a protest note to the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 21. This note strongly protests the Kenyan government's actions, which include inciting mobs to vandalize the Chinese Embassy's news display five times and unjustly expelling the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires. Additionally, it protests the recent anti-China remarks made by Kenyan Vice President Moi at a press conference. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya:

Vice President Moi of Kenya, at a press conference on August 2, falsely accused the Chinese Embassy of interfering in Kenya's internal affairs by sending Mrs. Anyindi a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao Zedong's portrait badges. He issued an "order" to ban the entry of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Previously, the Kenyan government had openly banned the import of the Swahili version of Mao Zedong's work "The Spark Will Become a Flame."

Since the start of China's Cultural Revolution, over the past half year, the Kenyan government has incited mobs to vandalize the Chinese Embassy's news display five times, unjustly expelled the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, and now Vice President Moi has personally engaged in anti-China activities. This is a very serious step by the Kenyan government to sabotage the relations between China and Kenya. The Chinese Embassy strongly protests this to the Kenyan government.

The Chinese Embassy, at the request of the Kenyan people, provided Chairman Mao Zedong's works and portrait badges. This is a normal activity for an embassy to enhance friendship between the two peoples, fully in accordance with international customs. How can this be considered an act of "gross interference in Kenya's internal affairs"? The Kenyan Embassy in Beijing also frequently distributes speeches by your government leaders and publications and propaganda materials from Kenya. Your actions of grossly interfering with and maliciously slandering the normal activities of the Chinese Embassy fully expose how far you have gone on the path of anti-China.

Why does Vice President Moi personally come out to engage in anti-China activities over such a normal matter? This can only be understood as your fear of the development of friendship between the Chinese and Kenyan peoples, your fear of the Kenyan people studying and researching Mao Zedong Thought, and your fear of the great influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In essence, you are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. It is the strongest ideological weapon against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The people of the world, the people of Africa, and the people of Kenya yearn to learn Mao Zedong Thought to seek the truth of anti-imperialism and national salvation. This is a great historical trend that no force can stop. The more you obstruct and oppose, the more the people will find ways to seek and learn. Your obstruction and opposition will only further place you in opposition to the people. Apart from this, there will be no good outcome.

It must be pointed out that Vice President Moi's personal involvement in anti-China activities comes after the recent visit to Kenya by Yang Xikun, the "Deputy Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who has been despised by 700 million Chinese people for many years and has been surviving under the protection of U.S. imperialism. This fact proves how closely the Kenyan government cooperates with U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in their anti-China actions! Over the years, the Kenyan government has been very active in collaborating with U.S. imperialism to create the "Two Chinas" plot. You are so blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs and openly opposing the Chinese people. The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate this.

We must warn the Kenyan government to immediately stop and reverse its anti-China actions. If you insist on continuing down this path, you will only fully expose your reactionary nature and ultimately face severe consequences in front of the Kenyan people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world.

    我大使馆就肯尼亚副总统亲自出马反华向肯政府提出最强烈抗议
    非洲人民学习毛泽东思想的历史潮流势不可挡
    肯尼亚政府如一意孤行继续反华必将碰得头破血流
    新华社二十二日讯  内罗毕消息：中华人民共和国驻肯尼亚大使馆八月二十一日向肯尼亚外交部递交一项抗议照会，对于继肯尼亚政府怂恿暴徒五次砸毁中国大使馆的新闻橱窗和无理驱逐中国大使馆临时代办之后，肯尼亚副总统莫依最近亲自出马在记者招待会上进行反华，向肯尼亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：肯尼亚共和国外交部：
    肯尼亚副总统莫依，在八月二日举行的记者招待会上，把一些莫须有的罪名强加在中国大使馆的头上，挑拨肯尼亚人民同中国人民的友谊，煽动反华。他胡说什么中国大使馆应昂迪格夫人的要求，向她寄送《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章是对肯尼亚内政“粗暴的干涉”，并签署了“法令”，悍然禁止《毛主席语录》入境。在这以前，肯尼亚政府还曾公然禁止毛主席著作《星星之火，可以燎原》的斯瓦希里文版进口。
    自从中国进行文化大革命以来，在最近的半年当中，肯尼亚政府曾经怂恿暴徒五次砸毁中国大使馆的新闻橱窗，后来又无理驱逐了中国大使馆临时代办；而今，副总统莫依竟又亲自出马进行反华。这是肯尼亚政府蓄意破坏中、肯两国关系一个极为严重的步骤。对此，中国大使馆特向肯尼亚政府，提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国大使馆应肯尼亚人民的要求，提供毛泽东主席的著作和像章，这本来是一个大使馆为增进两国人民友谊而进行的极为正常的工作，是完全符合国际惯例的。这怎么能够构成“粗暴干涉肯尼亚内政”的“罪状”呢？肯尼亚使馆在北京不也是经常散发你们政府首脑的讲话和在肯尼亚出版的书刊和宣传品吗？你们这种粗暴横蛮地干涉和肆意诬蔑中国大使馆正常活动的行为，充分暴露了你们在反华道路上已经走得很远了。
    身为副总统的莫依，为什么要抓住这样一件极为正常的事亲自出来反华呢？这只能被理解为：你们害怕中、肯两国人民友谊的发展，害怕肯尼亚人民学习和研究毛泽东思想，害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响。说穿了，你们就是害怕毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义最强大的思想武器。全世界人民、非洲人民和肯尼亚人民渴望学习毛泽东思想，从中寻求反帝救国的道理，这是一种伟大的历史潮流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。你们越是阻挠、反对，人民就越是要进一步地想方设法去探求，去学习。你们的阻挠和反对只能进一步把你们自己置于人民的对立面。除此之外，是不会有什么好下场的。
    还必须严正指出：你们的副总统这次亲自出头反华，是在早已被七亿中国人民唾弃、多年来一直在美帝庇护下苟延残喘的蒋介石匪帮的“外交次长”杨西昆最近访问肯尼亚之后进行的。这一事实，证明了肯尼亚政府在反华的行动上同美帝和蒋介石匪帮合作得多么密切！肯尼亚政府几年来配合美帝，在制造“两个中国”的阴谋中，也是很卖力气的。你们如此明目张胆地干涉中国内政，悍然与中国人民为敌，中国人民绝对不能答应。
    我们要警告肯尼亚政府，必须立即悬崖勒马，停止反华。如果你们硬要一意孤行，蛮干下去，那就只能彻底暴露你们的反动面目，最终将在肯尼亚人民、中国人民和世界革命人民面前碰得头破血流。
