The 15th of August, 1967, marks the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Burma. In these 28 years, our Party has experienced nearly 20 years of domestic revolutionary warfare. By March 28, 1968, it will be exactly 20 years. Therefore, the history of the Communist Party of Burma is mainly a history of armed struggle, a history of armed revolutionary struggle against armed counter-revolutionary struggle.

During the war against Japan, the Burmese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, launched a widespread armed struggle against the Japanese invaders throughout the country. The Allied Southeast Asia Command had to admit that 60% of the Japanese casualties in Burma were inflicted by our guerrilla forces.

The Party, in its 28 years, from 1945 to 1948, engaged in nearly three years of legal struggle. During this period, although legal struggle was the primary form of struggle, our Party continued to engage in armed struggle and conducted ideological education for the entire Party, instructing that if the enemy launched an armed attack, we must immediately counterattack with arms.

By 1945, the Communist Party of Burma had become the largest political party in Burma. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, with the participation of the broad masses of the people, was openly established.

In August 1946, the Communist Party led the largest general strike after the war. Workers, peasants, government employees, and police all participated in this general strike.

Therefore, in September 1946, British imperialism conspired to dissolve the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and formed the "Governor's Consultative Government."

The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, to adapt to the needs of imperialism and the domestic reactionaries, expelled the Communist Party from the united front in October 1946. After this, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League betrayed the interests of the people, compromised with British imperialism, and signed the Aung San-Attlee Agreement and the U Nu-Attlee Agreement. According to the U Nu-Attlee Agreement, Burma was to achieve formal independence on January 4, 1948, but Britain continued to control Burma's economy. From then on, Burma changed from a British colony to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country.

Under the leadership of the Party, the workers' movement, peasants' movement, urban poor, students, and government employees' movements, from the end of the Second World War in 1945 to 1948 when the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League compromised with imperialism and seized power, never stopped.

In 1948, the mass movement reached a new high. The workers of the Burma Oil Company went on strike; peasants launched a widespread struggle against landlords and usurers, fighting for the defense of tenancy rights, resistance to rent and taxes, abolition of old debts, refusal to repay old agricultural loans, and the struggle for new agricultural loans, and launched the anti-hunger campaign. Government employees and workers also planned a general strike.

At this time, the Burmese ruling class, at the instigation of British imperialism, suppressed the Communist Party of Burma, ethnic minorities, and other democratic forces, attempting to strangle the Burmese people's revolutionary movement. They launched an armed attack on our Party. The bourgeoisie in power, when their fundamental interests were threatened, simply discarded the mask of bourgeois democracy and, on March 28, 1948, initiated a civil war.

Regarding bourgeois democracy, we can utilize it, but we do not idolize bourgeois democracy. We recognize that bourgeois democracy is always limited, and the ruling bourgeoisie can only grant bourgeois democracy as long as it does not infringe upon its fundamental interests. Therefore, while utilizing bourgeois democracy, our Party conducted education for the entire Party on the seizure of power by armed force. Thus, when the enemy launched an armed attack on our Party, we could immediately organize the entire Party to counterattack with arms.

The armed revolutionary struggle in Burma, which began on March 28, 1948, targeted imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The Burmese revolution is also a component of the world proletarian revolution.

Revolutions always have high and low tides, and ours is no exception.

At that time, in 1948, our Party had almost no armed forces except in one or two counties. However, our Party, with the countryside as its base, organized the peasants, seized weapons from the enemy and police, and in just one year, our Party's armed forces grew to 15,000.

Under the influence of our Party's armed struggle, the People's Volunteer Army, three Burmese infantry battalions, three Karen infantry battalions, and one Kachin infantry battalion successively launched armed uprisings.

From 1949 to 1950, the revolutionary armed forces controlled most of the large, medium, and small towns, while the Burmese government only controlled Rangoon and some small towns. Therefore, foreign newspapers began to call the Burmese government the "Rangoon government." U Nu once said, "The government was on the verge of collapse."

Why did our Party achieve such great successes in this period?

First, because our Party's basic program in 1948 was correct, we established the policy of waging a just people's war against the unjust civil war of the ruling class.

Second, from 1948 to 1951, our Party led the land revolution, distributing land to the peasants under the slogan "The tiller owns the land," thereby winning the support of the broad masses of peasants and establishing a worker-peasant alliance.

Third, in this period, we conducted people's war according to Chairman Mao's thoughts, implementing a combination of militia, guerrilla forces, and regular army, conducting mine warfare, destroying railway and highway transportation lines, and using all weapons in the hands of the masses, including homemade cannons, to strike the enemy.

At this time, British imperialism and the Nehru reactionary government provided large amounts of military aid to the Burmese reactionary government. The Nehru reactionary government sent a fully armed force of 5,000 troops to the Burmese government.

At this time, our Party also made some mistakes in politics and military affairs. Therefore, from the middle of 1951, the revolution entered a low tide. Revolutionary forces temporarily abandoned large and medium-sized cities, retreated strategically, and regrouped in the countryside. In military terms, the number of battles and the number of enemies annihilated decreased.

The main reasons for this phenomenon were:

(1) The political line formulated at that time had a rightist tendency and made an erroneous analysis of the principal contradiction. Due to the activities of the Kuomintang bandits invading northern Burma, the contradiction between American imperialism and the people was mistakenly regarded as the principal contradiction. This led to the erroneous political line.

In this matter, the pressure exerted by the Khrushchevite revisionist line in China played a significant role.

(2) Under the guidance of the view that to oppose American imperialism, it is necessary to win over the landlord class, the land issue was mistakenly decided to return the land that had already been distributed to the peasants to the landlords. Although in reality, very little was returned, this erroneous decision had a very bad influence within the Party and the army.

(3) In military affairs, the theory of people's war was neglected, and bourgeois military theory temporarily gained the upper hand.

Because our Party was able to correct the errors in a short time, we preserved our basic forces.

At that time, the U Nu government formulated three steps to annihilate our Party and the People's Army.

The first step was to directly occupy our base areas with military force; the second step was to consolidate these occupied areas; the third step was to establish a government.

According to this plan, the U Nu government launched the "Anmaka Offensive" in 1956. This offensive was the largest launched by the enemy during the Burmese civil war, involving nearly 15,000 troops, including infantry, artillery, navy, and air force, using napalm bombs, and launching a well-deployed attack on the location of our Party Central Committee.

When the enemy launched the "Anmaka Offensive" and attacked our Party Central Committee, under the slogan "Defend the Party Central Committee," our Party and the national revolutionary forces launched a counterattack against the enemy. Therefore, after seven months, the "Anmaka Offensive" gradually weakened, and finally, this military plan was also foiled. The enemy's boast of annihilating our Party and the People's Army within two years was also completely foiled.

In 1956, in some areas, we were able to annihilate an entire enemy company, attack an enemy battalion and some cities, and eliminate some white guerrilla bases, expanding our guerrilla areas.

It was under such circumstances that the 20th Congress resolution of the CPSU was released. The Khrushchevite revisionism and the Chinese Khrushchevite revisionism, in cahoots, jointly sabotaged our armed struggle, causing great losses to our Party and the armed forces.

Within our Party, revisionist slogans such as "exchange weapons for democracy," "Burma does not need armed struggle," and "Burma can peacefully transition to socialism" emerged one after another.

Therefore, within the Party and the army, there was an extremely sharp struggle between two lines: whether to carry out the armed struggle to the end and seize political power by the proletariat, or to lay down arms and cooperate with the government, taking the path of abolishing the Party.

In this struggle, every comrade, every Party member, and every soldier had to take a stand. Comrades who adhered to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought firmly stood on the side of "seizing political power by armed force," while those on the opposing side all surrendered to the enemy.

Under the influence of modern revisionism, from 1957 to 1958, there was an unprecedented mass surrender incident in the history of Burmese armed struggle.

Our Party launched a fierce political and ideological counterattack against this surrenderist trend. Through our struggle, by 1959, we had basically stopped the surrenderist trend. Moreover, under such difficult conditions, we successfully established the National Democratic United Front, which included the Communist Party of Burma, the Karen National Union, the New Mon State Party, the Kayah People's Progressive Party, and the Kachin Independence Organization. In 1962, our Party firmly passed the resolution that "not a single gun can be handed over." In this matter, Chairman Mao's teachings on defending the fruits of victory in the article "On the Chongqing Talks" gave us great help.

In 1963, Ne Win staged a fake "peace talk." However, when he saw the people rising up, he was terrified and shamefully unilaterally broke the "peace talk."

The result of the "peace talk" made the people of the entire country see that Ne Win was the true culprit of the civil war and that the stand and methods of the Communist Party of Burma were correct, thus sparking another high tide of opposition to Ne Win.

The main danger of the Burmese armed struggle is modern revisionism. If we cannot overcome this main danger, our armed struggle will not be able to achieve victory. Therefore, our Party decided to oppose the main danger—modern revisionism. According to the Party's decision, all Party members and combatants, with unparalleled hatred, conducted a sharp, life-and-death struggle against modern revisionism. This was absolutely correct and necessary. Otherwise, the armed struggle would be doomed.

In September 1964, the Central Committee meeting again emphasized the need to seize political power by armed force. This resolution strengthened the unity of the Party, the army, and the people, enabling us to achieve one victory after another in military, political, and other aspects.

Now, let's talk about the progress in military struggle since November 1963 when the Ne Win government broke off the "peace talk."

After the "peace talk" broke down in 1963, the Ne Win military government launched five consecutive "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against our Party Central Committee within a year. However, all their "encirclement and suppression" campaigns failed. Their "encirclement and suppression" of the National Democratic United Front headquarters, as well as our local Party committees and local National Democratic United Front organizations, and their "encirclement and suppression" of the Shan, Kachin, and other ethnic groups, all ended in failure.

The Central Committee meeting held in 1964 analyzed the contradictions in the enemy's military affairs and made a correct judgment on the enemy's military situation. The Central Committee pointed out that the enemy had three insurmountable contradictions in military affairs. The first contradiction was between "pursuing" revolutionary forces and defense; the second contradiction was between the subjective desire to focus on attacking the Communist Party of Burma and the fact that a large number of troops were tied down by ethnic minority armed forces; the third contradiction was between the need for a large number of troops to attack revolutionary forces and the need for a large number of soldiers to participate in the work of monopolistic enterprises.

Because of these contradictions, the enemy could not launch large-scale attacks on us in various places at the same time, while we could utilize these contradictions to divide and annihilate the enemy.

Our Party and the allied forces annihilated more than 2,000 enemy troops in 1964, and the revolutionary war made more significant progress in 1965, with the battles becoming more annihilative.

In early 1965, our army and the National Democratic United Front forces attacked the town of Kway in Danu District, annihilating the defending enemy and seizing a large amount of weapons and cash. This battle was the prelude to a series of glorious battles in 1965.

Our army's combat effectiveness has significantly improved. For example, in the battle of Lepangkon in Bawmagyi District, our opponent was a first-class enemy platoon armed with American-made G-3 automatic rifles and carbines. In terms of experience and weapons, we were not as good as the enemy, but we struck them with twice the enemy's strength, resulting in the death and injury of some enemy troops and the seizure of all their weapons. In the battle of West Zaygon in Tharrawaddy District, we annihilated an enemy platoon with the strength of two squads.

This clearly shows that the theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought about the relationship between people and weapons, that people are the primary factor, is completely correct. A people's army armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be able to defeat an enemy army that is superior in technical level, training, and weaponry. This is not only correct from a strategic point of view but also achievable from a tactical and specific battle perspective.

From 1964 to 1965, there was a widespread mass movement of seizing and distributing the property of the government's "People's Supply Bureau" throughout the country. Not only did our armed forces participate in this movement, but the broad masses of the people also participated. This was a mass movement that directly struck the government, surpassing the level of the rice looting movement in 1947.

In 1964-1965, a large number of militiamen participated in the battles. This was a new development in the Burmese revolutionary war since 1950.

In 1965, battles resumed on the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line (we destroyed the railway in Pyinmana, attacked the town of Zaygon in Tharrawaddy District and the town of Kyatka in Bago District...). This had a significant impact on the political situation throughout the country.

A characteristic of the military struggle in 1965 was the appearance of battles around Rangoon (such as Lekhu, Hpankone, Laypwal, Tandaw, Dokehtan, Bago south of Ingyin, and Dingan). This was a new situation in the past six years.

The Kachin State, Shan State, Karen State, and Kayah State ethnic minorities also severely struck the military government. The revolutionary struggle of ethnic minorities not only indicates the political content of the alliance between the proletarian party and ethnic minorities but also shows that our revolutionary war has a broad guerrilla nature. It also shows that our revolutionary guerrilla bases are spread throughout the country and the depth and breadth of our revolutionary war.

During this period, our Party and the people's armed forces both developed, with the armed forces increasing by an average of 50%. According to incomplete statistics, our army participated in more than 400 battles in 1966. From 1966 to the present, our Party-led armed struggle has achieved new significant victories. For example, on the night of May 13, 1967, our army occupied the town of Kyaukpadaung, 100 miles north of Rangoon, for two hours; again, on July 11, 1967, our army annihilated an enemy platoon on the Pakokku-Dawei road and seized all their weapons.

What are the main manifestations of these military victories?

First, our base areas have expanded and consolidated. Our guerrilla base areas are spread throughout the southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest of Burma, that is, we have formed a surrounding situation against the enemy army with a broad guerrilla war. Among these base areas are Burma's main rice-producing areas—the deltas. In these areas, our Party and the People's Army control vast rural areas.

Second, the armed forces under the leadership of our Party have increased by 50% nationwide.

Third, the number of times our People's Army has taken the initiative to attack enemy strongholds and small and medium-sized towns has increased. The number of troops engaged in battles has also increased compared to previous times.

Fourth, the battle areas have expanded. Burma has more than 50 counties, of which 31 have guerrilla activities, accounting for more than 67% of the total number of counties nationwide.

Fifth, the economic struggle of peasants demanding to raise the price of rice to 500 kyats per 100 baskets has been closely combined with the people's war and further developed and expanded.

These struggles have greatly shaken the Ne Win military government. The rapid development of our Party-led armed struggle has further exacerbated the economic, political, and military crises of the Ne Win military government. In this situation, the Ne Win military government instigated anti-China incidents and further leaned towards American imperialism.

The Ne Win military government's crazy implementation of anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China policies is not only digging its own grave but will also further promote the further development of our armed struggle.

The history of the armed struggle in Burma is a history of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a history that proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere.

The history of the armed struggle in Burma is a history of the life-and-death struggle between the Marxist-Leninist military line and the bourgeois military line, and it is a history of the victory of the Marxist-Leninist military line.

Here, I would like to provide some materials to illustrate how Mao Zedong Thought and the armed struggle in Burma are combined.

1. Without armed struggle, there is nothing.

Chairman Mao teaches us in the article "On the People's Liberation Army" that "in China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." This teaching is also very correct for Burma.

On March 28, 1948, the ruling class launched a civil war against our Party and the people. In this situation, only armed revolution can be used to counter armed counter-revolution, and there is no other way out. Therefore, within three or four hours of the enemy launching the civil war, our Party Central Committee issued an order: to counterattack the enemy's armed attack with force. At the same time, we firmly criticized and overcame the idea within the Party that only emphasized legal struggle and advocated surrender to the enemy. If our Party Central Committee had hesitated at that time, had an unclear attitude, and had not followed Chairman Mao's instruction that without armed struggle there is nothing, there would be no Communist Party, People's Army, base areas, and people's democratic government today, and there would be nothing today.

In the long process of armed struggle, our Party not only overcame revisionism within the Party but also overcame revisionism from the international communist movement. The Soviet revisionists are traitors to the revolutionary movements of all countries. They want us to abolish the armed struggle in Burma. Our Party fought resolutely against the Soviet revisionists.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his gang colluded with the Soviet Khrushchevite revisionists, using cunning and deceitful means to make us abandon the armed struggle. When it became impossible for them to openly ask us to abandon the glorious armed struggle, they proposed that in Burma, armed struggle is not the main form of struggle and that armed struggle and legal struggle should be placed on an equal footing. Their purpose was still to make us abandon the armed struggle and enter the legal sphere.

In this fierce struggle, Chairman Mao's thoughts finally triumphed within our Party and our army.

2. Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

Chairman Mao teaches us in the classic work "Problems of War and Strategy" that "every Communist must understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" This teaching has extremely important significance for our Party and our revolution. If we do not follow Chairman Mao's teaching, our Party would not have been able to persist in nearly 20 years of armed struggle.

The oppressed classes must seize political power from the ruling classes, and this can only be done through the gun. Apart from this, there is no other way. Whether it is the transition from slave society to feudal society, from feudal society to capitalist society, or from capitalist society to socialist society, it has fully proved this universal truth.

All political struggles are class struggles, and the highest form of class struggle is armed struggle. Chairman Mao used the most popular language to clearly expound this very important principle of Marxism-Leninism.

Our Party overcame the revisionist idea within the Party and the army that advocated seizing political power through the legal parliamentary road. Our Party clearly pointed out: only political power can be seized by armed force, and so-called peaceful development is impossible.

The Khrushchevite revisionists, however, openly proposed that in Burma, peaceful development is possible and that a peaceful transition can be made. They attempted to make our Party enter the legal sphere and turn our Party into a revisionist party that follows the ruling classes.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his gang are no different from the Soviet revisionists. They said that Ne Win might become a Castro, that Ne Win was sincerely building the country, and that Ne Win was building an independent and self-reliant economy. He needed cadres, and if our Party cooperated with him, all problems could be solved. The implication was that peaceful transition was possible, and therefore, there was no need to wage armed struggle against the Ne Win government.

It is very clear that in this matter, the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang opposed Chairman Mao's teaching that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

In this struggle within the Party and the army, Chairman Mao's thoughts also triumphed.

3. Establish rural base areas and surround the cities from the countryside.

Chairman Mao's vivid teaching on establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside has extremely important practical significance for the Burmese revolution.

On March 28, 1948, when the enemy launched the civil war, our Party followed Chairman Mao's teaching, and most Party members and cadres withdrew from the cities to the countryside and engaged in armed struggle in the countryside. In our country, the ruling classes' strength is more concentrated in the cities, and their strength in the countryside is weak. While our Party has carried out long-term organizational work in the countryside and developed the peasants' movement, so our Party has a strong force in the countryside. To build the Party, the army, and the united front, we must and can rely on the peasant masses to establish rural base areas. Therefore, we implemented Chairman Mao's instruction on surrounding the cities from the countryside.

A Party leader, however, firmly opposed this idea. This person, based on the view of "launching an uprising through a general strike," proposed first seizing political power in the cities and then developing to the countryside.

Thus, a fierce struggle between two lines emerged. In this struggle, Chairman Mao's thoughts triumphed completely. Because of this, our revolution developed in the correct direction and waged a protracted war for 20 years.

This is not only an important issue for the Chinese or Burmese revolution but also a major issue of historical significance related to the revolutionary path of economically backward, agrarian, colonial, and semi-colonial, semi-feudal countries. These countries have extremely sharp struggles over the path of revolutionary development. Is it to follow the Chinese path, that is, to follow the policy of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside, and wage a protracted armed struggle? Or is it to follow the Indian path, that is, to struggle within the legal sphere and follow the parliamentary path?

The Soviet Khrushchevite revisionists and the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang have repeatedly attempted to make us abandon the Chinese path and follow the Indian path. They proposed that Burma is different from old China. In Burma, bourgeois democracy is more prevalent than under the rule of the Kuomintang government in old China, and bourgeois democracy can be utilized to wage the struggle. Their intention was to make us abandon the armed struggle and enter the legal sphere, engaging in long-term legal struggle. Facts have proven that this idea is extremely erroneous and extremely reactionary.

Today, the protracted people's wars being waged in Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Thailand, Malaya, the Philippines, and some Latin American countries, following the policy of surrounding the cities from the countryside, prove that the path of the Chinese revolution is correct and that the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's thoughts is correct.

We are fully convinced that as long as we firmly grasp Chairman Mao's teachings and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's teachings, the armed struggle in Burma will certainly achieve final victory.

4. The armed struggle in Burma is a peasant war led by the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us in the article "On the People's Liberation Army" that "the armed struggle of the Communist Party of China is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat."

The armed struggle in Burma once again proves that Chairman Mao's teaching is completely correct.

Before the armed struggle in 1948, there were 700,000 members of the peasant associations under the leadership of our Party, which developed to one million in 1951. Our armed struggle is a peasant war under the leadership of the working class.

Before the armed struggle, our Party led the peasants in various struggles, such as resisting rent, resisting taxes, defending tenancy rights, refusing to repay old agricultural loans, struggling for new agricultural loans, and struggling for grain. After the armed struggle began, our Party, under the slogans "The tiller owns the land" and "The land revolution is the center of the democratic revolution," carried out land reform. Therefore, the broad masses of peasants actively supported our Party's armed struggle and took up arms to defend the fruits of the land revolution. More than 90% of our army's soldiers are peasants, and most of our Party members are also peasants.

In the current stage of the revolution, to establish an anti-feudal united front in the countryside and wage a peasant war, it is necessary to formulate a correct peasant policy. Our Party formulated and implemented the policy of "relying on poor peasants and hired laborers, firmly uniting middle peasants, neutralizing rich peasants, and concentrating on striking landlords." We used this correct policy to win over and unite the peasants, gaining the support of the peasant masses.

According to our experience, it is necessary to consolidate our class base in the countryside. The main reliance is on poor peasants and hired laborers, and on this basis, firmly unite the middle peasants. Only by adhering to this point can we carry out the land revolution, which is the axis of the people's democratic revolution, and truly wage a peasant war led by the proletariat.

Our Party also had such an experience and lesson, that is, due to the inability to correctly implement the class policy in the countryside, the armed revolution suffered losses.

Therefore, as long as we can act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and wage a peasant war led by the working class, our revolution will certainly achieve final victory!

5. Even a small country can establish a red political power through a protracted war.

Establishing a red political power through a protracted war is unprecedented in the world.

This first happened in China. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The cause of this phenomenon is twofold, namely, the local agrarian economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and the policy of imperialist division of spheres of influence and split-and-rule. Because of the long-term division and war between the white regimes, a condition was created, enabling a small or several small areas of communist-led red regimes to emerge and persist amidst the white regimes' encirclement."

After summarizing the experience of the national democratic revolutionary movements in colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries after the Second World War, Chairman Mao pointed out that in the contemporary world, even in a small country, it is possible to implement the strategy of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside, wage a protracted guerrilla war, establish base areas, and ultimately achieve national victory. Our country's revolutionary experience once again proves that Chairman Mao's instruction is correct.

Burma is a small country with only 25 million people, equivalent to one province in China.

Since around 1947, we have debated whether a small country like Burma can wage a protracted revolutionary war.

The Soviet Khrushchevite revisionists and the Chinese revisionists denied the possibility of waging a protracted armed struggle in a country like Burma. They said that such a struggle is only possible in a large country like China with unique conditions. They used such means to sabotage the armed revolution.

However, the experience of the Burmese revolutionary war over the past 20 years has once again proven that even in a small country, as long as there is a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and this Party can rely on and organize the masses, primarily the peasant masses, and firmly grasp and implement the correct political principle of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside, it is possible to wage a protracted war and establish a red political power.

Facts have proven that not only in South Vietnam, Laos, and Burma, but also in Thailand, Malaya, the Philippines, and some Latin American countries, it is possible to wage a protracted war according to this principle.

Some people say that without the support of a socialist country, it is impossible to wage a protracted war. This is also a wrong argument. It violates the Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought that revolution cannot be imported and that only the main reliance on the Party and the masses of the country can make the revolution develop.

Of course, the support of a socialist country will play a certain role in the material conditions for the development of the revolution. However, it is obvious that this is not the main factor.

If it is said that only by being close to a socialist country can an armed revolution be waged, then the great October Revolution led by Comrade Lenin would not have occurred, because at that time there was no socialist country in the world; as for now, many countries in the world do not have the conditions for revolution. It is known to all that Malaya, the Philippines, and some Latin American countries do not have the support of a socialist country, but these countries are waging long-term revolutionary struggles.

Some people also say that it is impossible to wage a protracted armed struggle on islands that are not connected to the mainland. This argument is also wrong.

The geographical situation of the mainland or islands may have a certain impact on military affairs, but this is not the main factor. The main factor is to have a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and this Party can implement the correct political line, truly rely on and organize the masses, especially the peasant masses, and wage a protracted armed struggle.

The specific facts of Burma and other countries clearly prove that if this can be achieved, it is possible to establish base areas and red political power.

6. In building the people's army and waging the people's war, Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought has fought a fierce battle with bourgeois military thought, and finally, Mao Zedong Thought has triumphed!

Now, let's talk about some of the problems we encountered in this struggle.

(1) Should the Party command the gun, or should the gun command the Party?

First of all, it is necessary to establish the absolute leadership of the proletarian party over our people's army.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army must be under the leadership of proletarian ideology, serving the people's struggle and the construction of the base areas."

Our Party built the army according to Chairman Mao's teaching.

After building the army, we established military committees at the county and district levels, directly under the Party committee. At the central level, the Political Bureau directly leads the military.

When the army accepted the Party's leadership, our army was able to serve the people's struggle, and the revolutionary base areas developed.

However, in the mid-1950s when the regular army was organized, bourgeois military thought further infiltrated our troops. Those with this thought opposed the Party's leadership, saying that the army could only be commanded by military experts and that the Party did not understand military affairs, so it could not lead the army.

In the troops with this bourgeois military thought, the absolute leadership of the Party was weakened to a certain extent, and the people's army could not complete its mission victoriously.

According to our experience, Chairman Mao's teaching that "our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must not command the Party" is extremely precious. Our Party fought a sharp struggle with bourgeois military views and paid a bloody price. Now, because the Party's absolute leadership over the army has been established, we have continuously achieved victories in military affairs.

(2) Is the primary factor people, or is it weapons?

Another problem that arose in our army was whether the primary factor was people or weapons.

The proletarian military viewpoint, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, does not deny the definite role of technology and weapons. However, Chairman Mao teaches us, "The decisive factor is people, not things." Therefore, our Party has always advocated relying on the inexhaustible and boundless strength of the people. However, those with bourgeois military views do the opposite. They regard people as living tools, believe in weapons over people, and place weapons in the primary position. They look down on the people and oppose the army relying on the strength of the people.

Experience has proven that in areas where there is this bourgeois military thought, the army is detached from the masses and cannot well carry out the people's war.

Here is an example to illustrate that people are the primary factor. Our soldiers, as long as they have the correct political foundation and strong fighting spirit, can, with the fearless spirit of decisive victory, defeat the enemy even if each person only has five or ten bullets. However, in 1957 and 1958, some soldiers, due to the influence of revisionism, did not dare to fight even if they had fifty or sixty bullets; they were afraid of fighting. This is a very obvious example.

Now, our army, by grasping the Mao Zedong Thought that people are the primary factor in the relationship between people and weapons, the people's war has flourished again. Our guerrilla forces and the broad masses of militiamen have continuously and heavily struck the enemy.

(3) Strategically, we must despise the enemy, but tactically, we must take the enemy seriously.

Another important issue is to strategically despise the enemy, that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, but tactically, we must take the enemy seriously.

At present, we must admit that the enemy's strength is relatively stronger than ours. In terms of technology, weapons, and military training, the enemy is still stronger than us, and they receive aid from imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

In this situation, Chairman Mao's above teaching has extremely important practical significance for limiting the enemy's advantages, fully utilizing the enemy's weaknesses; overcoming our weaknesses, and fully developing our advantages. Especially Chairman Mao's judgment that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" has greatly enhanced our fighting will.

Chairman Mao also teaches us: "In every battle, concentrate absolutely superior forces (two, three, four times, sometimes even five or six times the enemy's forces) to annihilate the enemy's effective strength."

Chairman Mao's teaching has extremely profound, precious, and great practical significance.

Those in our army who had bourgeois military views could not understand this extremely precious teaching of Chairman Mao. They did not understand that from a long-term perspective, the enemy is only a paper tiger that is not at all frightening. They also did not understand that in specific battles, it is necessary to take the enemy seriously, concentrate absolutely superior forces, and attack the enemy with guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and annihilation warfare, surround the enemy on all sides, and annihilate them one by one. They only advocated fighting with equal forces, engaging in positional warfare and attrition warfare with the enemy's main forces. Under the guidance of this idea, the following situation often occurred: although in battle, our army had three or four times the enemy's forces, but to intercept the enemy, reserve forces were left, causing the forces to be dispersed. Therefore, when engaging with the enemy, we actually only had equal forces. In this situation, our army not only could not annihilate the enemy's effective strength but also had to retreat due to the exhaustion of ammunition.

Now, our army has grasped and implemented Chairman Mao's teaching on concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy, and annihilative battles have appeared throughout the country.

(4) Our army should be a force that carries out three major tasks, implements three major democracies, and emphasizes political and ideological work.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the people's army must undertake the three basic tasks of combat, mass work, and production. It must implement the three major democracies within the army, that is, political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy, and place political and ideological work in the first position.

Within our army, there was a sharp struggle between the proletarian military line that insisted on Chairman Mao's instructions on building the people's army and the bourgeois military line that opposed this line.

Those with bourgeois military views attempted to build a purely combat-oriented bourgeois army, attempted to suppress democracy within the army, implement bureaucratic rule, and negate the political and ideological work of the troops.

Our Party firmly fought against the above reactionary bourgeois military thought, and the Mao Zedong military line triumphed within our army.

(5) We must rely mainly on self-reliance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the basis of our policy? It is based on our own strength, called self-reliance. We are not isolated; all countries and peoples in the world that oppose imperialism are our friends. However, we emphasize self-reliance."

This teaching is extremely important not only for the struggle of the Burmese people but also for the struggle of the oppressed classes of the world.

Our Party, following Chairman Mao's teaching, resolutely waged the armed struggle.

The weapons and ammunition in our hands were seized from the enemy by the method of self-reliance, using the lives and blood of our comrades.

The spirit of self-reliance is very important. Without this spirit, we would not rely on our own strength and the strength of the people.

While relying mainly on self-reliance, we do not reject international aid. We believe that we must strive for the sympathy and support of the oppressed peoples of the world, especially the sympathy and support of the 700 million Chinese people.

We believe that if we can obtain international sympathy and support on the basis of self-reliance, then our revolution will develop rapidly.

The armed revolutionary struggle in Burma has already taken root among the people and cannot be destroyed by anyone. The future is very bright. Both the domestic and international situations have created very favorable conditions for the development of the revolution.

As mentioned above, our guerrilla base areas are spread throughout the country. We are using a broad guerrilla war to surround the enemy army.

At the same time, we must admit that at present, the enemy is superior to us in both quantity and equipment. To fundamentally change the balance of power between the enemy and us, we must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and closely combine it with our country's practice.

At present, the Ne Win military government, facing economic, political, and military crises, has created anti-China incidents and further leaned towards American imperialism. As our struggle develops victoriously, the Ne Win military government will further lean towards American imperialism. Finally, when it cannot deal with us with its own army, it may bring in American imperialist troops to Burma. Our Party has fully estimated this possibility and has made preparations.

If American imperialism invades Burma, the Burmese people will raise the banner of anti-Americanism and bravely fight.

In 1965, Chairman Deqin Dan Dong said when talking about the possibility of American imperialism entering Burma: "In the future, we will not only have to deal with the armed forces of the Ne Win military government that launched the counter-revolutionary civil war, but we may also have to deal with the armed forces of American imperialism and its running dogs. However, no matter how powerful the enemy is, no matter how long we have to fight, no matter how great the difficulties and hardships we encounter, the Burmese people are prepared to endure unprecedented losses and sacrifices and fight with unshakable confidence!"

We will definitely fight on according to Chairman Deqin Dan Dong's instructions!

In our forward march, there may be twists and turns and temporary setbacks, but from an overall perspective, the Burmese revolution is steadily advancing and will certainly achieve final victory!

Our Burmese revolution will certainly achieve victory!

Because our revolution is led by the Communist Party of Burma. The Communist Party of Burma is a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a party with serious criticism and self-criticism, and a party closely linked with the people. It is a brave, glorious, and tested party.

There is also a people's army that unconditionally accepts our Party's leadership.

There is also a national democratic united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all forces that can be united.

Therefore, our armed revolution will certainly achieve final victory!

The Burmese people's democratic revolution will triumph!

The Burmese Chiang Kai-shek—Ne Win military government will be defeated!

Establish a people's democratic government!

Down with American imperialism!

Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution in China!

Long live the unity of the peoples of Burma and China!

Long live the unity of the Communist Party of Burma and the Communist Party of China!

Wish Chairman Deqin Dan Dong good health!

Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Long live!

    缅甸人民革命武装斗争必胜
    ——为纪念缅甸共产党诞生二十八周年而作
    缅共中央第一副主席　德钦巴登顶
    （一）
    一九六七年八月十五日，是缅甸共产党成立二十八周年纪念日。
    在二十八年中，我们党经历了将近二十年的国内革命战争，到一九六八年三月二十八日就整整二十年了。
    所以，缅甸共产党的历史主要是武装斗争的历史，是一部武装的革命反对武装的反革命的斗争史。
    在抗日战争时期，缅甸人民在缅甸共产党的领导下，在全国广泛开展了抗日武装斗争。盟军东南亚总部也不得不承认，日本在缅甸战场上的伤亡数中，百分之六十是被我们的游击队打死的。
    党在二十八年中，从一九四五年到一九四八年将近三年的时间内是进行合法斗争的。在这期间，虽然合法斗争是主要斗争形式，但是，我党仍然同时进行武装斗争，并对全党进行思想教育，如果敌人一旦向我们发动武装进攻，就必须立即用武装进行反击。
    到一九四五年，缅甸共产党已成为缅甸唯一的最大的政党。在缅甸共产党的领导下，公开成立了有广大人民群众参加的缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟总部。
    一九四六年八月，共产党领导了战后最大的一次总罢工。工人、农民、政府机关雇员和警察都参加了这次总罢工。
    因此，一九四六年九月，英帝国主义就阴谋瓦解反法西斯人民自由同盟，让反法西斯人民自由同盟组织了“总督咨询政府”。
    反法西斯人民自由同盟为适应帝国主义和国内反动派的需要，在一九四六年十月竟把共产党开除出统一阵线。这以后，反法西斯人民自由同盟就背叛了人民的利益，向英帝国主义妥协，签订了昂山—艾德礼协定和吴努—艾德礼协定。根据吴努—艾德礼协定，答应缅甸在一九四八年一月四日取得形式上的独立，但英国继续控制缅甸的经济。从此以后，缅甸就由英帝国主义的殖民地变为一个半殖民地半封建的国家。
    在党的领导下轰轰烈烈地开展起来的工人运动、农民运动、城市贫民、学生和机关雇员的运动，从一九四五年第二次世界大战结束起，到一九四八年反法西斯人民自由同盟向帝国主义妥协并掌握政权，始终没有停止过。
    一九四八年，群众运动又出现了新的高潮。缅甸石油公司的工人举行了罢工；农民广泛地开展了反对地主、反对高利贷者的群众性斗争，进行了保卫租佃权、抗租抗税、废除旧债、拒绝偿还旧农贷、争取新农贷等斗争，开展了反饥饿大进军；政府机关雇员和工人也曾酝酿过总罢工。
    这时，缅甸统治阶级在英帝国主义的唆使下，对缅甸共产党，对少数民族和其他民主力量进行了镇压，企图扼杀缅甸人民的革命运动。他们向我们党发动了武装进攻。执政的资产阶级在其根本利益受到威胁时，他们就干脆抛弃了资产阶级民主的假面具，在一九四八年三月二十八日挑起了内战。
    对于资产阶级民主，我们可以加以利用，但是我们并不迷信资产阶级民主。我们认识到资产阶级民主总是有限的，执政的资产阶级只能在不触犯其根本利益的情况下才给予资产阶级的民主。因此，我们党在利用资产阶级民主的同时，对全党进行了武装夺取政权的教育。所以，当敌人向我们党发动武装进攻的时候，我们能立即组织全党进行武装反击。
    一九四八年三月二十八日开始的缅甸革命武装斗争，其打击对象是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。缅甸革命也是世界无产阶级革命的一个组成部分。
    革命总有高潮和低潮，我们的革命也是如此。
    在一九四八年三月二十八日那个时候，我们党除了在一两个县以外，几乎没有什么武装。但是，我们党以农村为根据地，组织农民，从敌军和警察手中夺取武器，仅仅一年的时间，我们党的武装力量就发展到一万五千人。
    在我们党的武装斗争的影响下，人民志愿军、三个缅族步兵营、三个克伦族步兵营和一个克钦族步兵营也相继举行了武装起义。
    一九四九年至一九五○年中，革命武装力量控制了大部分大、中、小城镇，而缅甸政府只掌握仰光和一些小城镇。因此，外国报刊开始把缅甸政府叫做“仰光政府”。吴努也曾说，“政府差一点就要垮台了”。
    党在这个时期为什么会取得这些巨大的成绩呢？
    第一，因为我们党一九四八年的基本纲领是正确的，我们确立了以正义的人民战争反对统治阶级非正义的内战的方针政策。
    第二，我们党从一九四八年到一九五一年领导了土地革命，在“耕者有其田”的口号下，将土地分配给农民，从而赢得了广大农民的支持，建立了工农联盟。
    第三，我们在这个时期按照毛主席的思想进行了人民战争，实行民兵、游击队、正规军三结合，进行地雷战，破坏铁路和公路交通线，使用了包括土炮在内的群众手中的一切武器，打击了敌人。
      这时候，英帝国主义和尼赫鲁反动政府向缅甸反动政府提供了大量的军事援助，尼赫鲁反动政府为缅甸政府派出了一支全副武装的五千人的部队。
    这时，我们党在政治上、军事上也犯了一些错误。因此，从一九五一年年中开始，革命转入了低潮。革命力量暂时放弃了大中城市，实行战略退却，到农村重新集结部队。在军事方面，战斗次数和歼敌数量都减少了。
    发生这种现象的主要原因是：
    （一）当时制定的政治路线有右的倾向，对主要矛盾做了错误的分析。鉴于蒋匪军侵入缅北境内活动，错误地把美帝国主义同人民大众之间的矛盾当作主要矛盾。结果导致政治路线的错误。
    在这个问题上，中国的赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线所施加的压力起了不小的作用。
    （二）由于错误的政治路线的影响，在所谓为了反对美帝国主义必须争取地主阶级的观点指导下，在土地问题上，曾错误地决定将那些已经分配给农民的土地归还地主。虽然实际上归还的很少，但这一错误决定，在党内、军内起了很坏的影响。
    （三）在军事上，忽略了人民战争的理论，而资产阶级军事理论却暂时占了上风。
      由于我们党能够在很短的时间内纠正错误，所以保存了我们的基本力量。
    当时，吴努政府制定了消灭我党和人民军的三个步骤。
    第一步，依靠军事力量直接侵占我们的根据地；第二步，巩固这些占领区；第三步，建立政权。
    吴努政府根据这项计划，于一九五六年发动了“昂玛卡攻势”。这个攻势是敌军在缅甸内战期间所发动的攻势中最大的一次，这次攻势投入了包括步兵、炮兵、海军、空军的将近一万五千人的兵力，使用了凝固汽油弹，对我党中央所在地发动了部署严密的进攻。
    当敌人发动“昂玛卡攻势”向我党中央进攻时，在“保卫党中央”的口号下，我党和全国革命力量向敌人发起了反击。因此，在七个月以后，“昂玛卡攻势”就逐渐减弱了，最后，这一军事计划也就破产了。敌人妄图采取的“三部曲”，连第一部都没有得逞就破产了。敌人所吹嘘的说什么要在两年内彻底消灭我们党和人民军的牛皮，也彻底破产了。
    一九五六年，我们在某些地区能够全歼敌人整个连，能够袭击敌人一个营和一些城市，能够拔掉一些白色游击队的据点，扩大我们的游击区。
    就在这种形势下，苏共二十大决议出笼了，赫鲁晓夫修正主义和中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义，狼狈为奸，共同破坏我们的武装斗争，给我党和武装部队造成了巨大的损失。
    在我们党内，“以武器换民主”、“缅甸不需要进行武装斗争”、“缅甸可以和平过渡到社会主义”等等修正主义言论也随之纷纷出笼。
    因此，在党和军队内，就出现了一场极其尖锐的两条路线的斗争：究竟是要把武装斗争进行到底，由无产阶级夺取政权呢，还是放下武器，同政府合作，走取消党的道路。
    在这场斗争中，每个同志，每个党员，每个战士都要表态。坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的同志坚决站在“武装夺取政权”这一边，而站在对立面的人都向敌人投降了。
    在现代修正主义的影响下，一九五七——一九五八年出现了缅甸武装斗争史上空前的集体投降事件。
    我们党对这股投降风，从政治上和思想上进行了猛烈的反击。经过我们的斗争，在一九五九年基本上煞住了投降风。并且就在这样困难的条件下，胜利地建立了包括缅甸共产党、克伦族团结党、新孟邦党、克耶族进步党、钦族最高委员会在内的民族民主团结阵线。一九六二年，我们党又坚决通过了“一支枪都不能交出去”的决议。在这个问题上，毛主席在《关于重庆谈判》一文中指出的有关保卫胜利果实的教导，给了我们巨大的帮助。
    一九六三年，奈温搞了一个假“和谈”。可是，当他看到人民群众起来的时候，就怕得要命，可耻地单方面地破坏了“和谈”。
    “和谈”的结果，使全国人民看清了奈温是内战的真正罪魁祸首，看清了缅甸共产党的立场和作法是正确的，因此又一次出现了反对奈温的高潮。
    缅甸武装斗争的主要危险是现代修正主义。如果不能战胜这个主要危险，我们的武装斗争就不可能取得胜利。因此，我们党决定反对主要危险——现代修正主义。根据党的决定，我们的全体党员和指战员以无比的仇恨同现代修正主义进行了尖锐的、你死我活的斗争。这是十分正确的，也是应该的。否则，武装斗争将会被葬送。
    一九六四年九月，中央全会再次强调要武装夺取政权。这个决议加强了党、军队和人民的团结，使我们在军事、政治等各个方面取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    现在谈谈自一九六三年十一月奈温政府破坏“和谈”以来，军事斗争方面的进展情况。
      一九六三年“和谈”破裂后，奈温军人政府在一年之内向我党中央连续发动了五次“围剿”。但是，他们的“围剿”都失败了。他们对民族民主团结阵线总部的“围剿”，以及对我地方党委和地方民族民主团结阵线组织的“围剿”，对掸族、克钦族的“围剿”，也同样遭到惨败。
    一九六四年举行的中央全会分析了敌人在军事上的矛盾，并对敌人的军事状况作出了正确的判断。中央全会指出，敌人在军事上存在着三个不可克服的矛盾。第一个矛盾是“追剿”革命力量和防守之间的矛盾；第二个矛盾是主观上要重点进攻缅甸共产党与大
  量兵力被少数民族武装所牵制的矛盾；第三个矛盾是它进攻革命力量需要大量兵力与大批军人参加垄断企业工作之间的矛盾。
    由于存在着这些矛盾，敌人就无法在各个地方同时向我们发动大规模的进攻，而我们却能够利用这些矛盾，分割敌人，加以消灭。
    我们党和友军在一九六四年消灭了二千多敌人，一九六五年革命战争又取得了更加明显的进展，战斗就更具有歼灭性了。
    一九六五年初，我军和民族民主团结阵线的部队进攻了丹兑县的瓜镇，全歼守敌，缴获了大量武器和现款。这一仗是一九六五年一系列光荣战斗的序幕。
    我军的战斗力有了明显的提高。例如，在卑谬县勒榜孔的一次战斗中，我们的对手是用美制G—3式自动步枪和卡宾枪等自动武器武装的第一流敌军的一个班，论经验和武器，我们不如敌人，但是，我们以两倍于敌的力量打击了他们，战斗结果，打死打伤部分敌人，缴获了全部武器。在沙拉瓦底县西松贡一战，我们以两个班的兵力全歼敌军一个班。
    这清楚地表明，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于人与武器的关系，人是主要的因素这一理论是完全正确的。用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，一定能够战胜在技术水平、训练程度和武器装备方面超过自己的敌军。这一条不仅从战略观点上看是正确的，而且从战术上和具体战斗来说也是可以实现的。
    一九六四——一九六五年间，在全国普遍地出现了没收和分配官方的“人民物资局”物品的群众运动，不仅我们的武装力量参加了这一运动，而且广大的人民群众也参加了。这是超过一九四七年抢米运动水平的、直接打击政府的群众性运动。
    一九六四——一九六五年，有大量的民兵参加了战斗。这是自一九五○年以来，缅甸革命战争的新发展。
    一九六五年，仰光—曼德勒的铁路线上又恢复了战斗（我们破坏了彬文那的铁路，袭击了东吁县的最杯镇和勃固县的皎塔加镇……）。这对全国的政治形势有着巨大的影响。
    一九六五年军事斗争的一个特点，是仰光周围（例如勒固、逢基、莱波勒、端底、都基坦、勃固以南的茵格都、丁干遵一带）出现了战斗，这是过去六年来的新形势。
    克钦邦、掸邦、克伦邦和克耶邦等少数民族也在狠狠打击军人政府。少数民族的革命斗争，不但说明了无产阶级政党与少数民族建立了联盟这一政治内容，而且表明我们的革命战争具有广泛的游击战性质。它也表明我们革命的游击区遍布全国各地，以及我们的革命战争的深入和广泛。
    在这期间，我们党和人民武装力量都有了发展，武装力量平均增加了百分之五十。据不完全的统计，一九六六年我军参加战斗四百多次。从一九六六年到目前为止，我党领导的武装斗争又取得了新的重大胜利。例如，一九六七年五月十三日夜间，我军攻占了仰光以北一百英里的九彬高镇达二小时之久；又如一九六七年七月十一日，我军在包康—东吁的公路上歼灭敌人一个排，缴获了全部武器。
    这些军事胜利的主要表现是什么呢？
    第一、我们的根据地扩大和巩固了。我们的游击根据地遍布缅甸的东南西北，也就是说，我们用广泛的游击战争对敌军形成了包围的形势。在这些根据地中包括缅甸的主要产米区——三角洲。在这些地区，我们党和人民军控制了广大的农村。
    第二、我们党领导下的武装力量，在全国增长了百分之五十。
    第三、我们的人民军主动进攻敌人据点和中小城镇的次数增加了。投入战斗的兵力也比往常增加了。
    第四、战斗地区扩大了。缅甸一共有五十多个县，其中三十一个县有游击队在活动，占全国总县数的百分之六十七以上。
    第五、农民群众要求把谷价提高到每百箩五百缅元的经济斗争，同人民战争紧密结合起来，并进一步发展壮大。
    这些斗争大大地震动了奈温军人政府。我们党领导下的武装斗争的迅速发展，进一步加剧了奈温军人政府的经济、政治、军事等各方面的危机。在这种情况下，奈温军人政府挑起了反华事件，进一步投靠美帝国主义。
    奈温军人政府疯狂实行反共、反人民、反革命、反华政策，不仅是自掘坟墓，而且必将进一步促进我们的武装斗争的进一步发展。
    （二）
    缅甸武装斗争的历史，是伟大的毛泽东思想取得胜利的历史，也是证明毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理的历史。
    缅甸武装斗争的历史，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东军事路线同资产阶级军事路线之间，进行你死我活的斗争的历史，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东军事路线取得胜利的历史。
    这里想提供一些材料，来说明毛泽东思想和缅甸武装斗争是如何相结合的。
    一、没有武装斗争，便没有一切。
    毛主席在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》一文中这样教导我们：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”这个教导对缅甸来说也是十分正确的。
    一九四八年三月二十八日，统治阶级向我们的党和人民群众发动了内战。在这种情况下，只有用武装的革命来反对武装的反革命，舍此没有其他出路。因此，在敌人开始发动内战的三、四个小时内，我党中央就发出指示：要以武力反击敌人的武装进攻。同时，坚决批判和克服了党内的只强调合法斗争，主张向敌人屈服投降的思想。假如我们党中央在当时犹豫不决，态度不明朗，不遵循毛主席的没有武装斗争便没有一切的指示，就不会有今天的共产党、人民军队、根据地和人民民主政权，就不会有今天的一切。
    在长期的武装斗争过程中，我们党不仅克服了党内的修正主义，而且也克服了从国际共产主义运动中来的修正主义。苏联修正主义者是各国革命运动的地地道道的叛徒，他们要我们取消缅甸的武装斗争。我们党同苏联修正主义者进行了坚决的斗争。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，同苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者勾结起来，用阴险狡猾的手段要我们放弃武装斗争。当他们公开要我们放弃光荣的武装斗争成为不可能时，他们便提出，在缅甸，武装斗争并不是主要斗争形式，应该把武装斗争和合法斗争放在同等地位，其目的还是要我们放弃武装斗争，进入合法范围。
    在这一激烈的斗争中，毛主席的思想在我党我军内最后取得了胜利。
    二、枪杆子里面出政权。
    毛主席在《战争和战略问题》这一经典著作中教导我们：“每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”这个教导对我们的党和我们的革命具有非常重要的意义。如果我们不遵循毛主席的这一教导，我们党就不可能坚持将近二十年的武装斗争。
    被压迫阶级要从统治阶级手里夺取政权，只能是依靠枪杆子。除此以外，没有其他任何方法。无论是从奴隶社会过渡到封建社会，从封建社会过渡到资本主义社会，还是从资本主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，都充分证实了这一普遍真理。
    一切政治斗争都是阶级斗争，阶级斗争的最高形式是武装斗争。毛主席用最通俗的语言，清晰地阐述了这一非常重要的马克思列宁主义的原理。
    我们党克服了党内军内主张通过合法的议会道路和平取得政权的修正主义思想。我们党明确指出：只能武装夺取政权，所谓和平发展是不可能的。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却公然提出，在缅甸可以和平发展，可以和平过渡。他们企图让我们党进入合法范围，把我们党变成追随统治阶级的修正主义党。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙同苏联修正主义者是一丘之貉。他们说，奈温可能成为卡斯特罗，奈温正在诚心诚意地进行国家建设。奈温正在建设独立自主的经济，他需要干部，如果我党同他合作，就能解决一切问题。意思就是说，和平过渡是可能的，因此，对奈温政府用不着进行武装斗争。
    十分清楚，在这个问题上，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，是反对毛主席的枪杆子里面出政权的思想的。
    在党内军内的这一场斗争中，毛主席的思想也取得了胜利。
    三、以农村为根据地，农村包围城市。
    毛主席关于以农村为根据地，农村包围城市这一生动的教导，对于缅甸革命具有非常重要的现实意义。
    一九四八年三月二十八日，在敌人开始发动内战的情况下，我们党遵循了毛主席的教导，大多数党员和干部从城市撤到农村，并在农村进行武装斗争。在我国，统治阶级的力量，更多地集中在城市里，他们在农村的力量是薄弱的。而我们党，在农村进行长期组织工作，开展农民运动，所以，我党在农村中有强大的力量。为了建党、建军和建立统一战线，我们必须而且能够依靠农民群众建立农村根据地。所以，我们执行了毛主席关于农村包围城市的指示。
    有一位党的领导人，却坚决反对这一思想。这个人根据“通过总罢工举行起义”的观点，提出先在城市里夺取政权，然后再向农村发展的主张。
    于是出现了两条路线的激烈斗争。在这场斗争中，毛主席的思想取得了彻底的胜利。正因为这样，我国革命才朝着正确的方向发展，并进行了二十年的持久战。
    这不仅是中国或缅甸革命的重要问题，而且关系到经济落后的，农业经济占统治地位的殖民地和半殖民地、半封建国家的革命道路，是具有历史意义的重大问题。这些国家，在革命发展的道路问题上，是有极其尖锐的斗争的。是走中国道路，即以农村为根据地，在农村包围城市的方针指导下，进行长期武装斗争呢？还是走印度道路，即在合法斗争范围内，走议会斗争的道路呢？
    苏联的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，都曾多次企图让我们放弃中国道路，走印度道路。他们提出，缅甸和旧中国不同。在缅甸，资产阶级民主比蒋介石政府统治下的旧中国要多，可以利用资产阶级民主开展斗争。他们的意图就是要我们放弃武装斗争，进入合法范围，搞长期的合法斗争。事实雄辩地证明，这种思想是极端错误、极端反动的。
    今天，越南、老挝、缅甸、泰国、马来亚、菲律宾和拉丁美洲某些国家正在进行的实行农村包围城市方针的持久的人民战争证明，中国革命的道路是正确的，毛主席思想所指引的方向是正确的。
    我们完全相信，只要我们牢牢地掌握毛主席的教导，彻底贯彻毛主席的教导，缅甸武装斗争一定能够取得最后胜利。
    四、缅甸武装斗争是无产阶级领导的农民战争。
    毛主席在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》一文中教导我们：“中国共产党的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导之下的农民战争。”
    缅甸的武装斗争再一次证明，毛主席的这一教导是完全正确的。
    一九四八年武装斗争开始以前，我们党领导下的农会会员有七十万人，一九五一年发展到一百万人。我们的武装斗争是工人阶级领导之下的农民战争。
    在武装斗争以前，我们党领导农民进行了各种斗争，诸如抗租、抗税、保卫租佃权、拒绝偿还旧农贷、争取新农贷、争取粮食等等。在武装斗争开始以后，我们党在“耕者有其田”，“土地革命是民主革命的中心”等口号下，进行了土地改革。因此，广大农民群众积极支持我们党的武装斗争，并拿起武器保卫土地革命的果实。我军的战士百分之九十以上是农民子弟，我党的大部分成员也是农民子弟。
    在革命的现阶段，为了在农村建立反封建的统一战线，进行农民战争，必须制订正确的农民政策。我们党制订并执行了“依靠贫雇农，牢固地团结中农，中立富农，集中打击地主”的政策。我们利用这项正确的政策，争取和团结了农民，获得了农民群众的支持。
    根据我们的经验，必须在农村巩固我们的阶级基础。主要是依靠贫雇农，并且在此基础上，牢固地团结中农。只有坚持这一点，才能进行作为人民民主革命的轴心——土地革命，才能够真正进行无产阶级领导的农民战争。
    我们党也有过这样的经验教训，即由于不能正确执行农村的阶级政策，以致武装革命遭到了损失。
    因此，只要我们能够按照毛主席的指示办事，进行由工人阶级领导的农民战争，我们的革命就一定能取得最后胜利！
    五、即使是小国，也能通过持久战，建立红色政权。
    通过持久战，建立红色政权，这是世界上空前的。
    这件事首先发生在中国。毛主席指出：“这种现象产生的原因有两种，即地方的农业经济（不是统一的资本主义经济）和帝国主义划分势力范围的分裂剥削政策。因为有了白色政权间的长期的分裂和战争，便给了一种条件，使一小块或若干小块的共产党领导的红色区域，能够在四围白色政权包围的中间发生和坚持下来。”
    毛主席在总结了第二次世界大战后，殖民地半殖民地、半封建国家的民族民主革命运动的经验后指出，在当代，即使是在小国，也能实行建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市的战略，进行长期的游击战争，建立根据地，最后夺取全国胜利。我国革命的经验再一次证明毛主席的这一指示是正确的。
    缅甸是一个只有二千五百万人口的小国，只相当于中国的一个省。
    大约从一九四七年开始，我们就争论过，象缅甸这样的小国，能否进行长期的革命战争。
    苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和中国的修正主义者否定在缅甸这样的国家进行长期武装斗争的可能性。他们说，这种斗争，只有在象中国那样大的、具有独特条件的国家才有可能进行。他们就是采取这种手段破坏武装革命的。
    但是，二十年来的缅甸革命战争的经验再一次证明，即使是小国，但只要有一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党，而这个党又能依靠和组织群众，首先是依靠和组织农民群众，能坚决掌握和执行以农村为根据地，农村包围城市这一正确的政治原则，就能进行持久战，建立红色政权。
    事实证明，目前不但在南越、老挝和缅甸，而且在泰国、马来亚、菲律宾以及一些拉丁美洲国家，也能根据这一原则进行持久战。
    有人说，不背靠社会主义国家就不能进行持久战。这也是一种错误的论点。它违背了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于革命不能输入，只有主要依靠本国的党和群众的力量，革命才能发展起来的学说。
    当然，背靠社会主义国家，对于革命的发展，在物质条件方面是会起一定的作用的。但是，显而易见，这并不是主要的。
    如果说，只有靠近社会主义国家，才能进行武装革命的话，那么，就不可能出现列宁同志亲自领导的伟大的十月革命了，因为当时世界上还没有社会主义国家；就目前来说，世界上许多国家，根本不具备革命的条件。众所周知，马来亚、菲律宾以及拉丁美洲国家，都没有背靠社会主义国家，但是这些国家都在进行长期的革命斗争。
    还有人说，在不与陆地相连的岛屿上，是不能进行长期的武装斗争的。这种论点也是错误的。
    大陆或岛屿等地理形势，在军事上也许会产生一定的影响，但是，这并不是主要的。主要的是要有一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党，而且这个党又能执行正确的政治路线，真正依靠和组织群众，特别是农民群众，进行长期的武装斗争。
    缅甸和其他国家的具体事实明显地证明，如能做到这一点，就能建立根据地和红色政权。
    六、我们在建设人民军和进行人民战争的问题上，毛主席的无产阶级军事思想同资产阶级军事思想进行了激烈的斗争，最后毛泽东思想取得了胜利！
    现在谈谈我们在这场斗争中所遇到的一些问题。
    （1）究竟是党指挥枪还是枪指挥党？
    首先，必须树立无产阶级政党对我们人民军队的绝对领导。
    毛主席教导我们：我们的军队必须是服从于无产阶级思想领导的，服务于人民斗争和根据地建设的工具。
    我们党就是按照毛主席的这一教导建军的。
    建军后，我们建立了县区一级的军事委员会，属党委直接领导。在中央一级，由政治局直接领导军事。
    在军队接受党的领导时，我们的军队就能够服务于人民的斗争，革命根据地就得到发展。
    但是，在一九五○年年中组织正规军的时候，资产阶级军事思想，进一步渗入我们的部队。有这种思想的人，反对党的领导，他们说什么军队只能由军事家来指挥，党不懂军事，所以不能领导军队。
    在那些持有这种资产阶级军事思想的部队里，党的绝对领导受到了一定的削弱，人民军队就不能胜利完成自己所担负的任务。
    根据我们的经验，毛主席关于“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”的教导，是极其宝贵的。我们党与资产阶级军事观点进行了尖锐的斗争，并付出了血的代价。现在，由于树立了党对军队的绝对领导，所以在军事上连续不断地取得了胜利。
    （2）人的因素第一，还是武器第一？
    在我军内出现过的另一个问题是，人的因素第一，还是武器第一的问题。
    无产阶级的军事观点即毛泽东思想，并不否认技术和武器的一定作用。但是毛主席教导我们，“决定的因素是人不是物”。因此，我党历来号召，必须充分依靠取之不尽、用之不竭的人民群众的力量。但是，持有资产阶级军事观点的人，却反其道而行之。他们把人看成是活的工具，迷信武器胜过于人，把武器放在主要地位。他们轻视人民群众，反对军队依靠人民群众的力量。
    经验证明，存在这种资产阶级军事思想的地区，军队就脱离群众，不能很好地开展人民战争。
    下面举一个例子，借以说明人的因素第一。我们的战士只要有正确的政治思想基础和旺盛的斗志，尽管每人只有五发或十发子弹，也能以决战决胜的大无畏精神打败敌人。但是，在一九五七年和一九五八年时，一些战士，由于受到修正主义的影响，即使有五、六十发子弹也不敢战斗，他们害怕战斗。这是一个很明显的例子。
    现在，我军由于掌握了在人与武器的关系上，人的因素第一这个毛泽东思想，人民战争又蓬勃发展起来了。我们的游击队和广大的民兵结合起来，连续不断地、沉重地打击了敌人。
    （3）战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人。
    另外一个重要的问题是，战略上藐视敌人，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，但是在战术上要重视敌人。
    目前，必须承认，敌人的力量相对说来还比我们强大。在技术、武器和军事训练方面还比我们强，而且得到帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的援助。
    在这种情况下，毛主席的上述教导，对于限制敌人的优点，充分利用敌人的弱点；克服我们的弱点，充分发扬我们的优点，具有非常重大的现实意义。特别是毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断，极大地提高了我们的战斗意志。
    毛主席还教导我们：每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），力求全歼敌之有生力量。
    毛主席的这一教导，具有非常深刻的、宝贵的和伟大的现实意义。
    在我军曾出现过的那些持有资产阶级军事观点的人，是无法理解毛主席的这一非常宝贵的教导的。他们不懂得，从长远的观点来看，敌人只不过是毫不可怕的纸老虎。他们也不懂得，在具体战斗中又必须重视敌人，集中绝对的优势兵力，用游击战、运动战和歼灭战进攻敌人，四面包围敌人，各个击破，彻底消灭。他们只热中于以相等的兵力，与敌人的主力部队展开阵地战、消耗战。在这种思想的指导下，就经常出现下列情况，即虽然在战斗中，我军有三、四倍于敌的兵力，但是为了截击敌人，留下后备队等，以致分散了兵力。因此，在和敌人交锋时，实际上只有与敌人相等的兵力。在这种情况下，我军非但不能消灭敌人的有生力量，反而由于弹药消耗光而撤退。
    现在，我军掌握和执行了毛主席关于集中优势兵力歼灭敌人的教导，在全国出现了歼灭性的战斗。
    （4）我军应该是一支执行三大基本任务的、实行三大民主的、突出政治思想工作的军队。
    毛主席教导我们，人民军队必须担负战斗、群众工作和生产这三项基本任务。必须在军内实行三大民主，即：政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，把政治思想工作放在第一位。
    在我军内，坚持毛主席关于建设人民军队指示的无产阶级军事路线与反对此路线的资产阶级军事路线之间，展开了尖锐的斗争。
    持有资产阶级军事观点的人，企图建立一支单纯打仗的资产阶级军队，企图在军内压制民主，实行官僚统治，否定部队的政治思想工作。
    我们党对上述反动的资产阶级军事思想进行了坚决斗争，毛泽东军事路线在我军内取得了胜利。
    （5）必须以自力更生为主。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。我们并不孤立，全世界一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生”。
    这一教导，不但对于缅甸人民的斗争，而且对于世界被压迫阶级的斗争，都是极其重要的。
    我们党遵照毛主席的这一教导，坚决地进行了武装斗争。
    我们手中的武器和弹药，是以自力更生的方法，用同志们的生命和鲜血，从敌人手里夺过来的。
    自力更生的精神是十分重要的。如果没有这种精神，就不会依靠自己和人民群众的力量。
    在以自力更生为主的同时，我们也并不排斥国际援助。我们认为，必须争取世界被压迫人民的同情和支持，特别是七亿中国人民的同情和支持。
    我们相信，如果在自力更生的基础上，同时又能得到国际同情和支持的话，那么，我们的革命，将会迅速发展。
    （三）
    缅甸的革命武装斗争，已经在人民群众中生根，是谁也破坏不了的。前途是十分光明的。国内形势和国际形势都为革命的发展创造了十分有利的条件。
    如上所述，我们的游击根据地已遍布全国。我们正以广泛的游击战争，把敌军包围起来。
    同时，我们必须承认，目前，敌人无论在数量上或者是装备上都超过我们。为了彻底改变敌我力量对比，我们必须牢牢掌握毛泽东思想，同本国的实践密切结合起来。
    目前，奈温军人政府，在面临经济、政治和军事等各方面危机的情况下，制造了反华事件，进一步投靠美帝国主义。随着我们斗争的胜利发展，奈温军人政府将更加投靠美帝国主义。最后，当它不能以自己的军队对付我们时，还有可能把美帝国主义的军队引进缅甸来。我们党充分估计了这种可能性，并已做好了准备。
    如果美帝国主义侵入缅甸的话，缅甸人民将高举反美的旗帜，英勇投入战斗。
    一九六五年，德钦丹东主席在谈到美帝国主义进入缅甸的可能性时说：“将来，我们不但要对付进行反革命内战的奈温军人政府的武装力量，而且还有可能要对付美帝国主义及其走狗的武装部队。但是，不管遇到多么强大的敌人，不管要打多久，不管要遇到多大的艰难困苦，缅甸人民准备忍受空前的损失和牺牲，满怀必胜的信心战斗下去！”
    我们一定按照德钦丹东主席的指示，坚决战斗下去！
    在我们前进的道路上，也许会出现曲折和遭受暂时的挫折，但是，从整体上来看，缅甸革命正在逐步向前迈进，并必将取得最后胜利！
    我们缅甸的革命，一定会取得胜利！
    因为，我们的革命是由缅甸共产党领导的。缅甸共产党是一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，有严肃的批评与自我批评的党，和人民群众紧密联系的党。是一个英勇的、光荣的、经受过考验的党。
    还有一支无条件地接受我们党的领导的人民军队。
    另外，还有一个工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的民族民主统一战线，团结一切可以团结的力量。
    因此，我们的武装革命，一定会取得最后胜利！
    缅甸人民民主革命必胜！
    缅甸的蒋介石——奈温军人政府必败！
    建立人民民主政府！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    缅中两国人民的团结万岁！
    缅甸共产党和中国共产党的团结万岁！
    敬祝德钦丹东主席身体健康！
    世界人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
