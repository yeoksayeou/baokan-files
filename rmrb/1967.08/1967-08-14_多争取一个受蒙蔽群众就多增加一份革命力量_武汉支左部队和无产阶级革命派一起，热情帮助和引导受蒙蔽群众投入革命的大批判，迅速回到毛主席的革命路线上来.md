The more people we win over from the misled masses, the more revolutionary strength we gain. The Wuhan Leftist Support Troops and the proletarian revolutionary masses together enthusiastically help and guide the misled masses to join the revolutionary big criticism, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: How can we seriously, wholeheartedly, deeply, meticulously, and practically do a good job of winning over the misled masses? The broad ranks of the Wuhan garrison's Leftist Support Troops, through practice, have initially gained some experience. This experience can be summarized as follows: We must regard the work of winning over and uniting the misled masses as an important part of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must use the invincible thought of Mao Zedong to guide the misled masses, earnestly leading them to join the revolutionary big criticism, making them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the deep and meticulous education and help of the soldiers and the proletarian revolutionary masses, in recent periods, the misled masses have risen up in rebellion, making a big comeback, batch by batch standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many have joined the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The leftist forces have rapidly grown stronger, and the proletarian cultural revolution army, with the leftists as the core, has become even more magnificent and unstoppable, powerfully promoting the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution and the new high tide of revolution and production in the Wuhan area.

We must regard the work of winning over and uniting the misled masses as a major political issue concerning the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The soldiers deeply feel that winning over and uniting one more class brother who has been misled means adding one more revolutionary force, and also adding one more soldier to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In Wuhan, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to save their doomed fate, are desperately struggling, creating white terror to suppress the proletarian revolutionary masses while deceiving and misleading the masses. This has caused some masses to be temporarily deceived and misled, losing their direction and standing on the wrong side. Educating and helping the misled masses to awaken and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launching a big criticism against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, making the handful of class enemies isolated and despised by all, is a powerful defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, how to correctly treat the misled masses is a major political issue concerning whether we can unite the majority, isolate the handful of class enemies to the greatest extent, and achieve new victories in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To raise awareness, the soldiers on the front line of supporting the left, together with the local proletarian revolutionary masses, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat be finally liberated, and repeatedly studied the letter from the Central Committee to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan City, as well as relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "PLA Daily." Through study, everyone realized that we must regard the work of winning over and uniting the misled masses as a major political responsibility that the proletarian revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army cannot shirk, thereby greatly enhancing the self-awareness of doing a good job in this regard.

The propaganda team of the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Fifth Company of a certain unit stationed in the Wuhan Steel Company found that some comrades in the revolutionary faction in the factory treated the misled masses with emotions instead of policies, were not good at doing patient and meticulous political and ideological work, and there was antagonism between the misled masses and the revolutionary faction. The soldiers had heart-to-heart talks with the responsible comrades of the revolutionary faction, making them realize that whether to correctly treat the misled masses is an attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They suggested that they take the lead in correctly handling this issue. The problem was solved, and the misled masses were very moved. They voluntarily handed over the iron spears given to them by the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes," admitted their mistakes, and eliminated the antagonism.

The soldiers have realized through practice that the current surging revolutionary big criticism, the proletarian revolutionary masses' big exposure, big criticism, and big struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, is a good battlefield for the misled masses to turn against their former comrades, correct their mistakes, and make amends to the people. The soldiers and the proletarian revolutionary masses together educate and unite the misled masses in the revolutionary big criticism, arousing their class consciousness, making them raise their awareness, clarify their direction, change their stance, decisively break with the handful of bad elements, draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, turn their weapons, launch a fierce counterattack, rebel within the old fortress, and bravely and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, joining the proletarian revolutionary masses with fierce firepower, launching an unprecedented scale of revolutionary big criticism.

The soldiers of the "Steel September 13" and other revolutionary organizations in a certain factory, with the help of the soldiers, regarded educating and winning over the misled masses to join the revolution as a very important task in the revolutionary big criticism. Through denunciation meetings and criticism meetings, they exposed the evil plots of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who deceived the masses and suppressed the proletarian revolutionary masses. Some workers who were deceived and joined the "Million Heroes" were greatly educated by the exposed facts, opening their eyes. They angrily said, "Previously, we were deceived by the handful of bad leaders in the 'Million Heroes,' mistaking black for red and red for black. Under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, we finally understood the truth! We are Chairman Mao's workers, not slaves of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party." They must rebel against these bad elements, return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses. They voluntarily examined their mistakes, posted big-character posters declaring rebellion and applying to join the genuine revolutionary organizations. The revolutionary comrades warmly welcomed them. Some of them have been approved to join the revolutionary ranks by the revolutionary faction.

In many factories, offices, and schools, with the enthusiastic help of the garrison soldiers and the proletarian revolutionary masses, some cadres and masses who understood the inside story of the "Million Heroes" were inspired by the Party's wise policy of "being misled is not a crime, turning against the former comrades is a merit" in the revolutionary big criticism. They rebelled and turned against their former comrades, providing the revolutionary faction with many important inside stories of the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes." Some joined the revolutionary faction on stage to expose and denounce, fiercely tearing off the masks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes," exposing their inside stories. The large number of facts they exposed not only further educated the broad proletarian revolutionary masses but also further educated and awakened the misled masses to turn against their former comrades. The misled masses awakened batch by batch, and the handful of class enemies became more isolated, falling into the vast sea of people's war.

Everyone agreed that among all the methods, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the misled masses is the most important. Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power, every word is the truth, one word is worth ten thousand words, and it is the most convincing and educating for the misled masses.

In the work of supporting the left in the Longjiang Navigation Company, the Seventh Company of a certain air force unit found that some misled masses had "three fears": fear of retaliation from the revolutionary faction, fear of not being trusted by the revolutionary masses, and fear of losing face. They worked with the revolutionary comrades to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and instructions with the misled masses, had heart-to-heart talks, and patiently explained the Party's policies. With their sincere and enthusiastic actions, the misled class brothers quickly saw that the revolutionary faction truly listens to Chairman Mao's words, has the broadest mind, and trusts the masses the most. The revolutionary faction will definitely not retaliate or exclude them. The misled masses realized this, quickly awakened, withdrew from their original organizations, and flocked to the revolutionary faction. Many were approved to join the proletarian revolutionary organizations. Some misled masses, after studying Chairman Mao's works, also realized that the reason for having "three fears" was mainly that the word "self" was playing tricks in their minds, they could not correctly treat the proletarian revolutionary faction, could not correctly treat themselves, and still feared losing "face." In fact, the faster and more thoroughly this "face" is discarded, the better. Only by thoroughly discarding it can one truly turn against the former comrades and truly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The broad ranks of soldiers have deeply realized through practice: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the guide to action for the proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also the guide to action for us to do a good job with the misled masses. Revolutionary soldiers must firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in their minds and implement it one hundred percent and without any discount. Everyone agreed: Helping the proletarian revolutionary masses do a good job with the misled masses, we must first fully believe that the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary soldiers can do a good job in this regard, mainly relying on them to do it, and absolutely not taking over their work. At the same time, we must also believe that all the misled masses, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, can educate themselves and liberate themselves. They firmly stated: We must, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, do a better job in this regard, and build new merits and labor for the people.

    多争取一个受蒙蔽群众就多增加一份革命力量
    武汉支左部队和无产阶级革命派一起，热情帮助和引导受蒙蔽群众投入革命的大批判，迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来
    据新华社武汉电　怎样严肃认真，满腔热情，深入细致，扎扎实实地做好受蒙蔽群众的工作？同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的武汉驻军支左部队广大指战员，在实践中初步摸索到一些经验，这些经验集中到一点就是：必须把争取团结受蒙蔽群众的工作当作保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要组成部分，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想给受蒙蔽的群众引路，认真引导他们投入革命的大批判，使他们迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    在指战员和无产阶级革命派深入细致的教育和帮助下，最近一个时期，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷起来造反，大杀回马枪，一批又一批地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了，许多人还参加了无产阶级革命派的行列，左派队伍迅速壮大，以左派为核心的无产阶级文化革命大军更加浩浩荡荡，势不可挡，有力地推动了武汉地区文化大革命的新高潮和抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    必须把争取和团结受蒙蔽群众的工作，放在保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识
    支左部队指战员们深深体会到，多争取团结一个受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄，就多增加一分革命的力量，也就多增加一名保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战士。武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，为了挽救他们即将覆灭的命运，拚命作垂死挣扎，在制造白色恐怖，镇压无产阶级革命派的同时，玩弄反革命的两面手法，千方百计地欺骗和蒙蔽群众，使一部分群众一时受了骗，上了当，迷失了方向，站错了队。教育、帮助受蒙蔽的群众觉悟过来，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头的反，使一小撮阶级敌人众叛亲离，陷于老鼠过街人人喊打的境地，就是有力地保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。因此，如何正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，是关系到能否团结大多数、最大限度地孤立一小撮阶级敌人和夺取无产阶级文化大革命新胜利的重大政治问题。
    为了提高认识，站在支左第一线的指战员们，同驻地的无产阶级革命派一起，重温了毛主席关于只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，反复学习了党中央给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信，以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》的有关社论。通过学习，大家认识到，必须把争取和团结受蒙蔽群众的工作，放在保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识，这是无产阶级革命派和人民解放军不可推卸的重大政治责任，从而大大提高了做好这一工作的自觉性。
    某部高炮五连驻武汉钢铁公司某厂毛泽东思想宣传组，发现厂里革命派的个别同志，对待受蒙蔽的群众，用感情代替政策，不善于做耐心细致的政治思想工作，受蒙蔽的群众和革命派之间有对立情绪。指战员们就和革命派的负责人谈心，使他们认识到是否正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题，并建议他们出面，正确处理这个问题。问题解决了，受蒙蔽的群众很受感动，他们主动把过去“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头发给他们的铁矛交了出来，承认了错误，消除了对立情绪。
    革命的大批判，是受蒙蔽群众反戈一击的战场
    支左部队指战员们从实践中体会到，当前这场汹涌澎湃的革命大批判，无产阶级革命派对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人滔天罪行的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，是教育受蒙蔽群众改正错误，反戈一击，为人民立功的好战场。指战员们和无产阶级革命派一起，在革命的大批判中共同教育、团结受蒙蔽的群众，激发他们的阶级觉悟，使他们提高认识，认清方向，转变立场，同一小撮坏家伙毅然决裂，与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，掉转矛头，狠杀回马枪，在旧营堡内部造反，勇敢地、迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，和无产阶级革命派一起，以猛烈的火力，投入规模空前的革命的大批判。
    某厂“钢九·一三”等革命组织的战士们，在部队同志的帮助下，在革命的大批判中，把教育、争取受蒙蔽的群众起来革命，作为一项极其重要的任务。他们通过控诉会、批判会，揭发武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶阴谋，揭发他们操纵“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头，蒙蔽群众，打击、镇压无产阶级革命派的滔天罪行。一些受蒙骗而参加了“百万雄师”的工人，在揭发出来的大量事实面前，受到极大的教育，擦亮了眼睛。他们愤怒地说，以前，我们受了“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的蒙蔽，把黑的当作红的，把红的反当作黑的。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，我们才真正明白了事实真相！我们是毛主席的工人，不是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的“奴隶”。我们一定要造这些坏家伙的反，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，永远和无产阶级革命派站在一起。他们主动检查错误，贴出造反声明和申请参加真正革命组织的大字报。革命派战士表示热烈的欢迎。他们中有些人已被革命派批准加入了革命行列。
    在许多工厂、机关和学校，在驻军指战员和无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，一些了解“百万雄师”内幕的受蒙蔽的干部和群众，在“受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功”的党的英明政策的感召下，在革命的大批判中，纷纷起来倒戈造反，有的为革命派提供了“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的许多重要内幕情况，有的同革命派一起登台揭发、控诉，猛揭武汉地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的内幕，狠撕他们的画皮。他们揭发的大量事实，不仅再次教育了广大的无产阶级革命派，也更加进一步教育并促使了受蒙蔽群众的迅速觉醒，反戈一击。受蒙蔽的群众一批又一批觉醒，一小撮阶级敌人越来越孤立，越来越陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海。
    毛泽东思想是教育受蒙蔽群众的最强大的思想武器
    大家一致认为，千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育受蒙蔽的群众是头一条。毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句，最能说服教育受蒙蔽的群众。
    在长江航运公司机关中执行支左任务的空军某部七连，在工作中发现有些受蒙蔽的群众有“三怕”：一怕革命派打击报复，二怕革命群众不信任自己，三怕面子上不好看。他们就同革命派的战士一道，认真和受蒙蔽的群众一起学习毛主席著作和指示，个别谈心，耐心交代党的政策。他们以自己热情恳切的行动，使受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟很快就看清楚，革命派真正是最听毛主席的话，胸怀最广阔，最相信群众，革命派绝不会报复、排斥自己。受蒙蔽的群众认识到这些，很快觉悟过来，退出了原来参加的组织，纷纷向革命派靠拢，许多人并被批准加入了无产阶级革命派的组织。一些受蒙蔽的群众经过学习毛主席著作，还认识到，所以有“三怕”，主要是头脑里私字在作怪，不能正确地对待无产阶级革命派，不能正确对待自己，还怕丢了“面子”。其实，这个“面子”丢得越快越好，越彻底越好，只有彻底丢掉它，才能真正反戈一击，真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    广大指战员在实践中还深深体会到：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级文化大革命行动的指南，也是我们做好受蒙蔽的群众工作的行动指南。革命战士必须在头脑里牢牢树立起毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，百分之百地、不折不扣地贯彻执行。大家一致认为：帮助无产阶级革命派做好受蒙蔽群众的工作，首先我们必须充分相信广大无产阶级革命派战士是能够做好这个工作的，主要是依靠他们去做，绝不能包办代替。同时，我们也必须相信一切受蒙蔽的群众，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，是能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己的。他们坚定地表示：一定要和无产阶级革命派一起，遵循毛主席的教导，更好地做好这项工作，为人民建新功，立新劳。
