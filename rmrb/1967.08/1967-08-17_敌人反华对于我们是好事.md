Recently, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have colluded with each other and incited the reactionary forces in Burma, Indonesia, India, and other countries to launch a wave of anti-China sentiment, which is quite arrogant and aggressive.

However, this is merely a small backlash in the current global revolutionary situation, nothing to be concerned about. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "In the history of mankind, any reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of all countries, and the great thought of Mao Zedong has spread widely around the world, making the days of all reactionaries even more difficult. If they do not oppose China, they cannot survive. Opposing China is precisely a manifestation of the increasing weakness of all reactionary forces.

Opposing China is not a new phenomenon. From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, the imperialists led by the United States and all reactionaries have been vigorously opposing China. Later, the Soviet revisionists also joined their ranks. Over the past seventeen years, every time China's revolutionary cause has made progress, they have launched a wave of opposition. However, no matter how much they oppose, they cannot harm China in the slightest. The great socialist China has grown and prospered amidst the curses and opposition of the enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us, and says we are utterly worthless, that would be even better. That would prove not only that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great results."

The frenzied anti-China stance of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries precisely proves that the Chinese people are the thorough proletarian revolutionaries who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; it proves that the Chinese people firmly oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries, firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and firmly practice proletarian internationalism; it proves that our work is correct and well done, and our revolutionary and construction undertakings have achieved great successes, winning the support of the people of the whole world.

Revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries are irreconcilable. If revolutionaries do not oppose counter-revolutionaries, they are not revolutionaries. If counter-revolutionaries do not oppose revolutionaries, they are not counter-revolutionaries. From the perspective of class struggle, it is inevitable and unavoidable that U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries unite to oppose China.

If they were not to oppose us but to praise us and support us, that would be terrible. Wouldn't that mean we have become one with them? In the past, the Soviet Union under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin had suffered fierce opposition from imperialism and reactionary forces in various countries. However, after the revisionist clique of Khrushchev seized power, things changed. The U.S. imperialists openly praised the Soviet revisionists as having become "law-abiding citizens of the world family" and the "best friends" of the West. The enemy's praise precisely proves that the Soviet revisionists have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the world revolution, and betrayed the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the whole world.

The frenzied anti-China stance of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries is actually an ominous sign for them.

The more they oppose China, the more they expose their counter-revolutionary faces to the people of the world. The more they oppose China and attack the great thought of Mao Zedong, the more the people of various countries will see that China is a great socialist country and recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for achieving revolutionary victory. The frenzied anti-China stance of the reactionary forces will only raise the awareness of the people of various countries and accelerate the development of their revolutionary struggles.

All reactionaries live by spreading rumors. They have fabricated countless lies about the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, trying to smear our faces. However, the result is always the opposite.

Before the victory of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao said about the anti-communist rumors spread by the Kuomintang reactionaries: "The Communist Party is a poor party, and it has been widely and thoroughly propagandized by the Kuomintang as a party of killing, arson, rape, looting, destroying history, culture, and the motherland, disrespecting parents, teachers, and elders, not reasoning, practicing communal marriage, human sea tactics, and so on. In short, it is a group of green-faced, wolf-toothed, ten-evil-doers. Yet, strangely enough, it is this group that has won the support of tens of millions of the people."

The situation is the same now. U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries have mobilized all their propaganda machines to slander China every day, trying to damage our international prestige and isolate us. But the result is that more and more people around the world support us, the influence of the Chinese revolution is greater, and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought is wider.

History has proven that the more fiercely one opposes communism and China, the faster one will collapse. Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist stance led to his downfall. By 1946, when he launched a full-scale attack on the liberated areas, he was defeated by the people in just three and a half years. Khrushchev took power and soon began to fiercely oppose China, but he collapsed in just a few years. All the "heroes" who fiercely oppose communism and China will only end up with bloody heads and suffer disgraceful failures.

"Plum blossoms rejoice in the snow, freezing flies is nothing strange." In the blizzard of the world's revolutionary movement, U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries will only freeze to death like flies. Under the great thought of Mao Zedong, the great socialist China will forever stand tall in the world.

    敌人反华对于我们是好事
    本报评论员
    最近一个时期，美帝苏修互相勾结，并且策动缅甸、印尼、印度等国反动派，掀起了一股反华浪潮，其势汹汹，颇为嚣张。
    但是，这不过是当前世界大好革命形势中的一股小小的逆流，没有什么了不起。正如毛主席所指出的，“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。中国无产阶级文化大革命给予各国革命人民的巨大鼓舞，伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，使得世界上一切反动派的日子更加不好过。它们不反华，就混不下去。反华，正是一切反动势力日益虚弱的表现。
    反华，并不是件新鲜事。从中华人民共和国成立的那一天起，以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，就起劲地反华。后来苏修集团也加入了它们这一伙。十七年来，每当中国的革命事业前进一步，它们就要大反一通。但是，反来反去，损伤不了中国一根毫毛。伟大的社会主义中国，正是在敌人的咒骂和反对声中日益成长壮大起来的。
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    美帝苏修和各国反动派疯狂反华，恰恰证明了中国人民是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、彻底的无产阶级革命派；证明了中国人民坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，坚决支持各国人民革命斗争，坚决实行无产阶级国际主义；证明了我们的工作做得对，做得好，我们的革命和建设事业取得了伟大的成就，得到了全世界人民的拥护。
    革命派和反革命派是势不两立的。革命派不反对反革命派，就不成其为革命派。反革命派不反对革命派，就不成其为反革命派。用阶级斗争的观点看问题，美帝苏修和各国反动派联合反华，是必然的，不可避免的。
    如果它们不是反对我们，而是称赞我们，拥护我们，那就糟糕了，那我们岂不是同它们成为一伙了吗？过去，列宁、斯大林领导下的苏联，曾经遭到帝国主义和各国反动派的疯狂反对。可是，在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了政权之后，事情就倒转过来了。美帝公开表扬苏修已经成为“世界大家庭中的守法公民”，是西方的“最好的朋友”。敌人的好话，恰恰证明，苏修集团已经背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了世界革命，背叛了苏联人民和全世界人民。
    美帝苏修和各国反动派疯狂反华，自以为得意。其实，对它们来说，反华是它们的不祥之兆。
    它们一反华，就在世界人民面前进一步暴露了它们的反革命嘴脸。它们越是反对中国，越是攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，就使各国人民越是看清楚中国是伟大的社会主义国家，越是认识到毛泽东思想是取得革命胜利的最强大的思想武器。反动势力疯狂反华，其结果只能使各国人民的觉悟进一步提高，使他们的革命斗争更快地发展。
    一切反动派都是靠造谣吃饭的。它们给中国共产党人和中国人民编造了无数的谎言，企图在我们脸上抹黑。但是，结果总是适得其反。
    毛主席在中国革命胜利的前夕，在讲到国民党反动派的反共谣言时说过：“共产党是一个穷党，又是被国民党广泛地无孔不入地宣传为杀人放火，奸淫抢掠，不要历史，不要文化，不要祖国，不孝父母，不敬师长，不讲道理，共产公妻，人海战术，总之是一群青面獠牙，十恶不赦的人。可是，事情是这样地奇怪，就是这样的一群，获得了数万万人民群众的拥护”。
    现在，事情也是这样。美帝苏修和各国反动派开动它们的全部宣传机器，天天在那里诽谤中国，妄图破坏我国的国际威望，孤立我们。但结果是，世界上拥护我们的人越来越多，中国革命的影响越来越大，毛泽东思想的传播越来越广。
    历史无情地证明，谁反共反华最凶，垮台就越快。蒋介石一反共，他就倒霉了。到一九四六年，他对解放区发动全面大进攻，只有三年半的功夫，就被人民打垮了。赫鲁晓夫上台不久就大肆反华，没有过几年，就垮台了。一切反共反华的“好汉”们，都只能碰得头破血流，遭到可耻的失败。
    “梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”在世界人民革命运动的暴风雪中，美帝苏修和各国反动派只会象苍蝇一样冻死。而在伟大的毛泽东思想照耀下的伟大的社会主义中国，将永远在天地之间巍然屹立。
