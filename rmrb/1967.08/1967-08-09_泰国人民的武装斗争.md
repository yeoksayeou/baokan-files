Two years ago on August 7, the armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand fired the first shot in the armed struggle of the Thai people in Nong Khai village, Na Mo sub-district, Na Kham district, Nakhon Phanom province in northeastern Thailand.

On that day, the reactionary police sent by the Thai reactionary government, which is a lackey of U.S. imperialism, were causing trouble in the area around Nong Khai village. They were aggressive and violent, killing patriots in the area.

The bloody crimes of the reactionaries aroused the extreme anger of the local people. The patriotic armed forces decided to give these executioners a severe punishment. They gathered their forces and launched a brave attack on the reactionary police, immediately killing a police sergeant and seriously injuring a police colonel who led the reactionary troops, leaving him disabled.

The sudden attack by the people's armed forces caused the reactionary police to panic and flee in disarray. When the Thai reactionary government sent several hundred police in helicopters to the scene after receiving the news, the people's armed forces had already successfully withdrawn from the area. Those fools found nothing but a few bloodstains in the fields and had to return empty-handed.

Since that day, the armed forces of the Thai people have grown stronger and more developed in battle, dealing heavier and heavier blows to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

    泰国人民的武装斗争
    两年前的八月七日，泰国共产党领导的人民武装力量，在泰国东北部那空拍侬府那家县那磨乡的廊希村，打响了泰国人民武装斗争的第一枪。
    这一天，美帝国主义走狗泰国反动政府派出的反动警察，到廊希村一带进行骚扰活动。他们张牙舞爪，逞凶霸道，杀害了那里的爱国者。
    反动派的血腥罪行激起了当地人民的无比愤怒。爱国人民武装决心给这批刽子手以严厉的惩罚。他们集合了自己的队伍，对反动警察进行了英勇的袭击，当场就把一个警察上士击毙，并把带领这支反动队伍的一个警察上校打成重伤残废。
    人民武装的这次突然袭击，使反动警察立刻惊慌失措，乱作一团，纷纷逃命。当泰国反动政府得到消息以后派了几百名警察乘着直升飞机赶来时，人民武装早已胜利地撤出了这个地区。那批蠢家伙们除了看到田野上留着几片血迹以外，什么也没有找到，只好扑空而返。
    从那一天以来，泰国人民武装就在战斗中日益壮大发展，给了美泰反动派越来越沉重的打击。
