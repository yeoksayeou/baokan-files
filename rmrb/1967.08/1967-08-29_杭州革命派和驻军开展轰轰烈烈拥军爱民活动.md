The revolutionary forces and stationed troops in Hangzhou have launched a massive "Support-the-Army-Love-the-People" campaign. The troops say: Firmly standing with and clearly supporting the leftist masses is the greatest form of loving the people. The revolutionary forces, including the "Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Alliance" (Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Alliance), say: Firmly believing in, relying on, and learning from the People's Liberation Army, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and overthrowing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang is the greatest form of supporting the army.

In the intense struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary forces of the proletariat in Hangzhou City and the soldiers of the 7350th and 6409th units stationed in Hangzhou have recently launched a massive "Support-the-Army-Love-the-People" campaign. The soldiers say: Firmly standing with and clearly supporting the leftist masses is the greatest form of loving the people. The proletarian revolutionary forces are also excited to say: Firmly believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, learning from the People's Liberation Army, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and overthrowing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang is the greatest form of supporting the army.

Recently, the streets of Hangzhou are filled with large red banners for supporting the army and loving the people: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute the People's Liberation Army!" "Learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces!" "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionary forces!" The revolutionary mass organizations affiliated with the "Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Alliance" formed propaganda, report, film, and sports teams, visiting the camps of the 7350th and 6409th units to express their gratitude. They invited the units to share their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and learning from the glorious traditions and excellent styles of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers also enthusiastically invited the proletarian revolutionary forces to their companies to share their heroic struggles during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces. Preliminary statistics show that in the past month, Hangzhou City has held nearly 100 large-scale military-civilian joint celebrations, with more than 160,000 proletarian revolutionary fighters and soldiers participating. Each meeting fully reflected the atmosphere of the army loving the people, the people supporting the army, and the military and civilians fighting shoulder to shoulder.

During the "Support-the-Army-Love-the-People" campaign, the 7350th and 6409th units, which firmly stood with and clearly supported the leftists, received enthusiastic praise from the proletarian revolutionary forces. The proletarian revolutionary forces praised them as true soldiers of Chairman Mao and the people's children. Since intervening in the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of these two units have been fighting and working together with the proletarian revolutionary forces in factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools, learning from each other, and establishing deep class sentiments. Every time the proletarian revolutionary fighters recall the days of fighting together with the People's Liberation Army, they are always deeply moved, saying: When we were in difficulty, it was Chairman Mao who sent the People's Liberation Army to support and encourage us. We must believe in the People's Liberation Army, rely on the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army. At the beginning of this year, the revolutionary forces of the proletariat in the Zhejiang Provincial Art Troupe were relatively weak. A small clique of capitalists in power within the provincial and municipal committees suppressed these revolutionary fighters, declaring that the revolutionary mass organizations they established were illegal and threatening to disband these revolutionary organizations. At this time, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the 7350th and 6409th units came. After thorough investigation and research, they expressed their firm support for the revolutionary fighters. The soldiers helped the revolutionary fighters study Chairman Mao's works, supported them in performing propaganda programs for Mao Zedong Thought, and helped the revolutionary organization "New Art Combat Corps" to develop and grow. Since then, the proletarian revolutionary forces have been invigorated and have become stronger in the fight. Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, in June this year, the "New Art Combat Corps" established a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. They used Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to launch a fierce attack on the small clique of capitalists in power within the party. Recently, their self-created and performed program "Long Live the Great People's Liberation Army of China" fully expressed the deep class sentiments of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army.

During the "Support-the-Army-Love-the-People" campaign, the proletarian revolutionary fighters took the People's Liberation Army as an example, strengthening their revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline. In the intense struggle between the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Hangzhou Boiler Factory and the bourgeois reactionary line, the soldiers of the 7350th unit stationed in the factory fought side by side with the revolutionary forces at every critical moment, supporting them politically and ideologically. The soldiers went deep into the workshops, classes, and dormitories, studying Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary forces, helping them grasp the correct direction of the struggle. When the two organizations within the factory had different opinions and the contradictions became increasingly intense, the soldiers studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with the revolutionary forces, helping them correctly handle the differences in opinions among the masses. The head of the revolutionary committee of the factory said when recalling this experience: The soldiers firmly stood with us, passing on the experience of the People's Liberation Army emphasizing politics, which was the greatest support for us. Now, the revolutionary forces in the factory are actively carrying out activities to learn from the People's Liberation Army, determined to learn from the People's Liberation Army, actively apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen their revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, and build themselves into a vast revolutionary army that is highly proletarianized and revolutionary.

The mass "Support-the-Army-Love-the-People" campaign has further deepened the combat friendship between the proletarian revolutionary forces in Hangzhou City and the supporting-leftist troops. Now, the masses of the "Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Alliance" and other revolutionary organizations and the soldiers of the 7350th and 6409th units are closely united, fighting bravely to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces are full of confidence, saying: With the wise leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao and the support of the People's Liberation Army, we will definitely smash the bourgeois command center headed by China's Khrushchev. The broad masses of soldiers who firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary forces are also humbly listening to the opinions of the revolutionary masses, seriously summarizing experiences, and expressing their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to "Hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," striving to do the "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" work even better.

    军爱民，民拥军，军民团结一条心，夺取文化大革命新胜利
    杭州革命派和驻军开展轰轰烈烈拥军爱民活动
    驻杭部队指战员说：立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地支持左派广大群众，就是最大的爱民。“省联总”等革命派说：坚决相信、依靠和学习解放军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人，就是最大的拥军
    新华社杭州二十七日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈斗争中建立了战斗友情的浙江省杭州市无产阶级革命派和驻杭州的七三五○部队、六四○九部队广大指战员，最近开展了轰轰烈烈的“拥军爱民”活动。广大指战员说：立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地支持左派广大群众，就是最大的“爱民”。无产阶级革命派也激动地说：坚决相信和依靠解放军，向解放军学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人，就是最大的拥军。
    最近，杭州市街头到处张贴着拥军爱民的大红标语：“向解放军学习！”“向解放军致敬！”“向无产阶级革命派学习！”“坚决支持无产阶级革命派！”“浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部”（“省联总”）所属革命群众组织组成宣传、报告、电影、体育四个分队，深入到七三五○部队、六四○九部队的营区进行慰问，请部队学习毛主席著作积极分子介绍他们活学活用毛主席著作的心得体会，学习解放军的光荣传统、优良作风；部队的同志也热情地邀请无产阶级革命派到连队来介绍他们在无产阶级文化大革命中英勇斗争的事迹，向无产阶级革命派学习。据初步统计，近一个月来，杭州市举行的较大规模的军民联欢活动有九十多次，参加大会的无产阶级革命派战士和部队指战员有十六万多人。每次会上都充分体现了军爱民、民拥军，军民亲密团结，并肩战斗的气氛。
    在“拥军爱民”活动中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决支持左派的七三五○部队和六四○九部队指战员，受到无产阶级革命派的热烈赞扬。无产阶级革命派称赞他们不愧为毛主席的好战士，人民的子弟兵。这两支部队的广大指战员从介入地方无产阶级文化大革命以来，一直在工厂、企业、机关、学校等单位和无产阶级革命派一起战斗，一起劳动，相互学习，建立了深厚的阶级感情。无产阶级革命派战士每当回忆和解放军共同战斗的日子时，总是万分激动地说：在我们处于困难的时候，是毛主席派来亲人解放军支持了我们，撑了我们腰；我们要相信解放军，依靠解放军，向解放军学习。今年初，浙江省文艺队伍中无产阶级革命派的力量比较薄弱，省市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打击这些革命派战士，宣布他们成立的革命群众组织是非法组织，扬言要把这些革命组织解散掉。这时候，七三五○部队和六四○九部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队来了，他们经过充分的调查研究，表示坚决同革命派战士站在一起。指战员们帮助革命派战士学习毛主席著作，支持他们排演宣传毛泽东思想的文艺节目，并使文艺队伍中的革命组织“新文艺战斗兵团”得到发展壮大。从此，无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气，越战越强。在解放军的指导下，今年六月“新文艺战斗兵团”建立了一支毛泽东思想宣传队。他们用毛泽东思想作为最锐利的武器，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。最近，他们自己创作、演出的节目《伟大的中国人民解放军万万岁》，充分表达了军爱民、民拥军的深厚的阶级感情。
    广大无产阶级革命派战士，在“拥军爱民”活动中以解放军为榜样，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。在杭州锅炉厂无产阶级革命派同资产阶级反动路线进行的激烈斗争中，驻这个厂的七三五○部队指战员，在斗争的每个关键时刻都同革命派并肩战斗，从政治上、思想上支持他们。指战员们深入车间、班组、宿舍，和革命派一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他们紧紧掌握斗争大方向。当厂内两个组织因观点不同发生争论，矛盾越来越激化的时候，指战员们就和革命派一起学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，帮助革命派正确处理群众之间的意见分歧。这个厂的革命委员会负责人在谈到这一段经历的时候说：部队同志坚决地和我们站在一起，把解放军突出政治的经验传授给我们，这是对我们的最大支持。现在，这个厂的革命派正在积极开展学习解放军的活动，决心象解放军那样，活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，把自己建设成一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    群众性的拥军爱民活动，使杭州市无产阶级革命派和支左部队进一步加深了战斗友谊。现在，“省联总”等革命组织的群众和七三五○部队、六四○九部队的指战员，紧紧地团结在一起，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而英勇奋战。无产阶级革命派满怀信心地说：有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有解放军的支持，我们一定能够摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边的广大指战员，也在虚心地听取革命群众的意见，认真总结经验，表示坚决响应林彪副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的号召，争取把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好。（附图片）
    八月二十八日，中国人民解放军六九○○部队广大指战员和“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等无产阶级革命派热烈响应关于更大规模地开展热烈的拥军爱民运动的伟大号召，举行盛大集会游行。
