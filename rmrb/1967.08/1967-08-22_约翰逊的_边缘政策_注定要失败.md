Recently, American imperialism has intensified its bombing of North Vietnam, committing new heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people. Since August 11, U.S. aggressor planes have continuously bombed the residential areas of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the transportation hub Long Bien Bridge. They have also repeatedly bombed areas just ten miles from our border in Lao Cai. On August 18, they dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to cross the demilitarized zone and bomb North Vietnam. This is another serious escalation of the war by the U.S. aggressors.

On August 21, U.S. aggressor planes invaded our airspace, conducting military provocations against the great Chinese people. This act of aggression by American imperialism has been met with resolute strikes by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Johnson administration's frenzied escalation of bombings in North Vietnam and its military provocations against the Chinese people clearly reflect its dire straits and desperation in the Vietnam War.

On the battlefield in South Vietnam, the U.S.'s second "dry season offensive" has already suffered a crushing defeat. Since the rainy season, they have suffered continuous defeats, their troops are increasingly insufficient, and their situation has become more passive. Domestically, their manpower is nearly exhausted. Johnson has patched together a plan to increase troops by 45,000 to 50,000 by July 1 next year. Taylor's attempts to recruit cannon fodder from vassal states have also been unsuccessful. At the same time, military expenditures are increasing, the fiscal deficit is enormous, and the economy is severely deteriorating. The contradictions between the American people and the ruling class are becoming increasingly sharp, and the infighting within the American ruling class is more intense. The Johnson administration is in a predicament.

It is in this state of desperation that the Johnson administration once again foolishly hopes to find a way out by escalating bombings in North Vietnam. As early as the Glassboro talks, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had already jointly plotted a new "bomb to surrender," "stop bombing to negotiate" scam. Recently, Rusk admitted that Khrushchev had told Johnson in Glassboro that if the U.S. stopped bombing North Vietnam, negotiations to end the Vietnam War could possibly begin. The Soviet revisionist *Pravda* openly clamored on August 6 that if the U.S. stopped bombing North Vietnam, it could "open the way for Vietnam peace talks." Currently, the U.S.'s escalation of bombings in North Vietnam is part of this new scam plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

American imperialism has escalated the bombing areas to the vicinity of the Chinese border, even invading Chinese airspace; escalated the bombing targets to the urban areas of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; and escalated the bombing tools to B-52 strategic bombers. However, no matter how high Johnson escalates the bombings, he cannot escape the fate of failure.

American newspapers admit that the Johnson administration is playing a "brinkmanship policy," engaging in a "deadly gamble." In fact, this so-called "brinkmanship policy" is nothing new; it was proposed by the late Dulles after the U.S.'s failure in the Korean War. American imperialism suffered a bloody nose in the Korean War, but its aggressive ambitions did not die. It wanted to take risks but feared repeating the failure of the Korean War, so it adopted this gambler's "brinkmanship policy." This policy itself reflects the weak and hollow nature of American imperialism. Does this mean that Johnson's "brinkmanship policy" is more clever than Dulles'? No, on the contrary. The Johnson administration is in an even more difficult situation, with even weaker strength and even less capital than Dulles' time. If it still tries to play this gambler's trick, it can only end up losing more miserably.

Our great leader Chairman Mao once pointed out when talking about the counter-revolutionary forces' tendency to misjudge the situation: "Their class instincts lead them to always think that they are so great, while the revolutionary forces are not. They always overestimate their own strength and underestimate ours." American imperialism is exactly like this. When it launched the Korean War, it misjudged the situation. The U.S. ruling class later admitted that they were "in the wrong place, at the wrong time, against the wrong enemy, fighting the wrong war." Today, Johnson has not learned from this lesson at all; he continues to misjudge the situation. This is determined by the nature of imperialism.

No matter how frantically American imperialism escalates the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese people's sacred wish to unite their country is unshakable, and their will to fight against American aggression and save their country is indomitable. The heroic Vietnamese people will not be intimidated by the U.S. aggressors' indiscriminate bombings. They will surely turn their hatred into strength and strike the U.S. aggressors even more fiercely, more powerfully, and more accurately.

The Chinese people strongly condemn American imperialism's frenzied escalation of the Vietnam War. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation as their sacred internationalist duty. The Chinese people have had a showdown with American imperialism. American imperialism has tasted the might of the Chinese people. Today, our country's ongoing, magnificent Cultural Revolution has greatly enhanced the Chinese people's strength to support their Vietnamese brothers and oppose American imperialism. American imperialism's escalation of military adventurism will surely be met with severe punishment!

    约翰逊的“边缘政策”注定要失败
    本报评论员
    最近，美帝国主义加紧扩大对越南北方的狂轰滥炸，对越南人民犯下了新的滔天罪行。八月十一日以来，美国强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内居民区和交通要道龙边桥，并且多次轰炸距我国边境十英里的谅山。十八日，它又出动B—52战略轰炸机，窜过非军事区轰炸越南北方。这是美国侵略者又一次严重的战争“升级”。
    二十一日，美国强盗飞机竟然侵入我国领空，向伟大的中国人民进行军事挑衅。美帝国主义的这一侵略罪行，遭到了中国人民解放军的坚决打击。
    约翰逊政府疯狂扩大对越南北方的轰炸，向中国人民进行军事挑衅，恰恰反映了它在侵越战争中困难重重，走投无路。
    在南越战场上，美国第二个“旱季攻势”已经惨败，雨季以来又连吃败仗，兵力日益不足，处境更加被动。国内兵源濒于枯竭，约翰逊东拼西凑，好不容易提出一个明年七月一日前增兵四万五千到五万人的计划。泰勒到仆从国家去搜罗炮灰，也未能如愿以偿。同时，军费开支日增，财政赤字庞大，经济严重恶化。美国人民同统治集团的矛盾日趋尖锐，美国统治集团内部的争吵也更加激烈。约翰逊政府已陷入窘境。
    正是在这种一筹莫展的情况下，约翰逊政府又一次妄想用扩大对越南北方的轰炸来寻求一条出路。早在葛拉斯堡罗的会谈中，美苏已经共同策划要搞一次新的“以炸迫降”、“停炸诱和”的骗局。腊斯克不久前承认，柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗曾向约翰逊表示，只要美国停止对越南北方的轰炸，就可能开始举行结束越南战争的谈判。苏修《真理报》八月六日也公然叫嚷，美国停止轰炸越南北方，就能“开辟越南和谈的道路”。目前美国扩大轰炸越南北方，就是美苏合谋的这个新的骗局的一部分。
    美帝国主义把轰炸地区“升级”到中国的边境附近，甚至侵入中国领空；把轰炸目标“升级”到越南民主共和国首都河内的市区；把轰炸工具“升级”到B—52战略轰炸机。但是，约翰逊无论把轰炸升到哪一级，也同样逃脱不了失败的命运。
    美国报纸承认，约翰逊政府是在玩弄一种“边缘政策”，进行一场“致命的赌博”。其实，所谓“边缘政策”，并不是什么新鲜的玩意儿，而是死去了的杜勒斯在美国侵朝战争失败以后提出的。美帝国主义在侵朝战争中碰得头破血流，但是它的侵略野心不死，它既要冒险，又害怕重蹈侵朝战争失败的覆辙，因此就采用了这种赌徒式的“边缘政策”。这种政策本身，就反映了美帝国主义外强中干的虚弱本质。难道说，今天约翰逊的“边缘政策”就比杜勒斯的“边缘政策”更高明一些吗？不，恰恰相反。约翰逊政府比起杜勒斯当年的美国政府来，处境更加困难，力量更加虚弱，本钱更加少得可怜。它还要玩弄这套赌徒的把戏，只能是输得更惨。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在谈到反革命势力总是错误估计形势时曾经指出：“他们的阶级本能引导他们老是在想：他们自己怎样了不起，而革命势力总是不行的。他们总是高估了自己的力量，低估了我们的力量。”美帝国主义正是这样。它在发动侵朝战争的时候，错误地估计了形势。美国统治集团自己后来也承认，他们是“在错误的时间，错误的地点，同错误的敌人，进行错误的战争”。今天，约翰逊丝毫也没有吸取这个教训，他仍然是不断地错误估计形势。这是帝国主义的本性所决定的。
    不管美帝国主义怎样疯狂地扩大侵越战争，越南人民统一祖国的神圣愿望是不可动摇的，越南人民抗美救国的斗争意志是不可摧毁的。英雄的越南人民决不会被美国侵略者的狂轰滥炸所吓倒，他们一定会把仇恨化为力量，更狠、更猛、更准地打击美国强盗。
    中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵越战争的罪行。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一贯把支援越南人民抗美救国战争作为自己神圣的国际主义义务。中国人民是同美帝国主义较量过的。美帝国主义是尝过中国人民的厉害的。今天我国正在进行的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，更是大大增强了中国人民支援越南兄弟、反对美帝国主义的力量。美帝国主义扩大军事冒险，必将遭到严厉的惩罚！
