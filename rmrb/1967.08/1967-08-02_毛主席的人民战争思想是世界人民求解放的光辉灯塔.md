The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel enthusiastically acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War," unanimously expressing their determination to learn from Vice Chairman Lin's exemplary practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to thoroughly and completely sweep the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the Party and the army into the dustbin of history in the course of the great revolutionary criticism.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1: The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, in celebrating the glorious 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the great helmsman Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war, and the re-publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's brilliant work "Long Live the Victory of People's War."

The heroic troops and the glorious revolutionary masses of the proletariat point out with revolutionary fervor that Chairman Mao's theory on people's war is an important component of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's brilliant idea of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism. The most complete, most scientific, and greatest military theory established by Chairman Mao in the long course of revolutionary war is the pinnacle of Marxist-Leninist military thought. The great Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought not only opened the only correct path to national revolutionary victory for the Chinese people but also pointed out the brilliant path to liberation for the proletariat and oppressed peoples of the entire world. They express their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, to most loyally, firmly, and thoroughly execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought, and to make their greatest contributions in defending the motherland and the great proletarian cultural revolution, and in supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Today, after Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War" were broadcast on the radio, they immediately stirred up a wave of excitement across the country. The glorious guards standing by Chairman Mao's side, the heroic sentinels guarding the country's borders and coastal lines, the air force units diligently defending the country's airspace, the naval units patrolling the seas day and night, the railway construction troops fighting on the front lines, and the hundreds of millions of proletarian revolutionaries and broad masses of militiamen in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan, Xining, and other places, are everywhere beating drums and gongs, in a frenzy of excitement. "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" The shouts echo across the land and seas. The army, navy, and air force units, some of which listen repeatedly to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War," some of which hold morning celebrations, report meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and discussion meetings, and some of which send out large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to perform in factories, rural areas, offices, schools, and streets all day, propagating Chairman Mao's great military thought. In many places, the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards have pasted up big-character posters overnight to acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War." Some have also pasted up large banners on the streets praising Chairman Mao's great military thought and the People's Liberation Army. Some have raised battle flags, beaten drums and gongs, and rushed to the military camps to celebrate with the heroic soldiers the publication of Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's great work. Many young revolutionaries have immediately launched a fiery study campaign. They say that at this great moment when the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country is achieving new great victories, and when the revolutionary peoples in many regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising up to wage armed struggles and engage in fierce and tenacious battles with the old world, it is of the utmost significance to review Chairman Mao's theory on people's war. This is a great event in the political life of all the people of China and the world. It has extremely great and far-reaching significance for further strengthening the revolutionary construction of our army, for pushing the great proletarian cultural revolution to a deeper stage, for aiding the liberation struggles of the proletariat and revolutionary peoples of various countries, and for advancing the cause of world revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries must seriously study and resolutely implement it, forever unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and win together, and vow to drown imperialism and its running dogs, and the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the Party and the army, in the vast ocean of people's war.

The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, at this great moment of the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country, review Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War," and have a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They say that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to retain it must have a strong army." "The whole world can only be transformed by the gun." This is the summary of experience won with blood by the Chinese proletariat and the world proletariat. This is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism.

Under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have grasped this truth and opened up a path to victory. The proletariat and oppressed peoples of the world who want to achieve true liberation must also arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory on people's war and walk this path to victory, using the gun to smash the old state machine, using the gun to overthrow imperialism and its running dogs, and using the gun to transform the whole world. Some old Red Army soldiers who have followed the great helmsman Chairman Mao in countless campaigns north and south, war heroes, and revolutionary base area militia heroes who have always held high the banner of armed revolution in every revolutionary war, also use their personal experiences to illustrate that Chairman Mao's great thought on people's war is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, a powerful ideological weapon to defeat modern revisionism centered on the CPSU, and a beacon to guide the revolutionary peoples of the world in their armed struggles for true liberation. With Chairman Mao's military thought as their weapon, they further criticize the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the Party and the army in various places, who have always opposed Chairman Mao, opposed revolutionary armed struggle, opposed the proletariat seizing the gun, advocated the parliamentary road, and promoted capitulationism and other heinous crimes, and are determined to thoroughly and completely criticize, expose, and overthrow their thoroughly counter-revolutionary and revisionist line that they have always pursued. The broad masses of soldiers and proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan region, in the midst of the triumphant songs of pursuing and attacking the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Wuhan region, express that Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War" have brought us the sharpest weapon to criticize the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region. We must seriously study and master this powerful ideological weapon to smash capitalist restoration and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, firmly grasp the gun, form the broadest revolutionary united front with the revolutionary leftists as the core, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and drown the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Wuhan region in the vast ocean of people's war, ensuring that our country will never change color for ten thousand generations.

In studying Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin's essay "Long Live the Victory of People's War," the military and civilian personnel in various places further recognize that Vice Chairman Lin is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms and best student. The comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction in the direct-affiliated units of the Air Force and many soldiers on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" say that Vice Chairman Lin studies Chairman Mao's works best, uses them best, and understands Mao Zedong Thought most deeply. For decades, he has always loyally, firmly, and thoroughly executed and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and military thought.

The brilliant work "Long Live the Victory of People's War" systematically expounds and creatively develops Chairman Mao's military thought and is an exemplary model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They unanimously express that in studying Chairman Mao's great military thought, they will resolutely learn from Vice Chairman Lin's exemplary practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the course of the great revolutionary criticism, they will politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents within the army such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, thoroughly purge the poison of their bourgeois reactionary military line, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to turn our army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, the broad masses of soldiers in the army, navy, and air force and the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat in various places are further arranging to deeply study Chairman Mao's military thought. They point out that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army, the source of its invincible power, the guarantee of its never-changing nature, and also the lifeline of us proletarian revolutionary fighters. We want to avoid getting lost in the revolutionary struggle and continuously advance from victory to new victories. The fundamental thing is to, with deep feelings of boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao, launch a more profound and extensive campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly make Mao Zedong Thought engraved in our minds, dissolved in our blood, and implemented in our revolutionary actions, and forever advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the capital and many Red Guards from universities and colleges, the revolutionary young fighters of "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "Three Command Revolutionary Alliance," "New Hua Gong," "New Lake University," "New Hua Agriculture," "August 18" in Qinghai, the Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters in Shandong, the Third Command of the Red Guards in Hohhot, and many soldiers from various units all pointed out in the discussion meetings on studying Chairman Mao's remarks on people's war that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is not only a guide for revolutionary armed struggle but also a guide for the political struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, mobilize and organize the vast majority of revolutionary masses to the greatest extent, launch a great revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly and completely throw the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the army into the dustbin of history. Let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate our victorious advance.

    毛主席的人民战争思想是世界人民求解放的光辉灯塔
    全国亿万军民热烈欢呼毛主席论人民战争语录和林副主席《人民战争胜利万岁》的发表，一致表示坚决学习林副主席活学活用毛主席著作的光辉榜样，最坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，在革命大批判中，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在党内军内的代理人彻底干净地扫进历史垃圾堆。
    新华社一日讯　全国亿万军民在欢庆中国人民解放军建军四十周年的光辉节日里，以无比欢欣的革命激情，热烈欢呼伟大统帅毛主席论人民战争语录的发表，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席的光辉著作《人民战争胜利万岁》的重新发表。
    英雄的三军指战员和光荣的无产阶级革命派战士满怀革命豪情地指出，毛主席关于人民战争的理论，是当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的一个重要组成部分。毛主席关于农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的光辉思想，是马克思列宁主义的天才发展。毛主席在长期革命战争中所创立起来的最完整、最科学、最伟大的军事学说，是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰。伟大的毛主席，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国革命胜利的唯一正确道路，而且为全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民指出了争取解放的光辉道路。他们表示，坚决响应林副主席的伟大号召，一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手。最忠实、最坚定、最彻底地执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想，在保卫祖国和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在支援世界人民革命斗争中，做出自己最大的贡献。
    今天，毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席的《人民战争胜利万岁》一文在电台广播后，立即在全国各地掀起一片欢腾。光荣守卫在毛主席身边的首都警卫战士，警惕地驻守在祖国边防、海防线上的英雄哨兵，辛勤保卫着祖国领空的空军部队，在海上日夜巡航的舰艇部队，奋战在铁道建设战线上的铁道兵，以及北京、上海、天津、武汉、济南、西宁等地亿万无产阶级革命派和广大民兵，到处敲锣打鼓，一片欢腾。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻了陆地和海洋。陆海空军各部队，有的一遍又一遍地收听毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席的《人民战争胜利万岁》的广播，有的清晨起来就举行了庆祝会、报告会、讲用会、座谈会，有的还派出了大批毛泽东思想宣传队，整日活跃在工厂、农村、机关、学校和街头进行演出，宣传毛主席伟大军事思想。许多地区的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，连夜贴出了欢呼毛主席论人民战争语录和林副主席《人民战争胜利万岁》发表的大字报，有的还在大街上张贴了许多歌颂毛主席伟大军事思想、歌颂人民解放军的巨幅标语，还有的高举战旗，敲锣打鼓，赶往部队驻地，同英雄的战士们一起欢庆毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席伟大著作的发表，许多小将立刻展开了热火朝天的学习活动。他们说，在我国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得新的伟大胜利的大好形势下，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多地区的革命人民正在奋发起来展开武装斗争，同旧世界进行英勇顽强的大搏斗的今天，重温毛主席关于人民战争的理论，具有极其伟大的意义。这是全中国人民和全世界人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。这对于进一步加强我军的革命化建设，对于推动无产阶级文化大革命向更深入的阶段发展，对于援助各国无产阶级和革命人民的解放斗争，对于推进世界革命事业，都具有极其伟大而深远的作用。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要认真学习，坚决贯彻，永远同人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，誓把帝国主义及其走狗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在党内、军内的代理人，通通淹死在人民战争的汪洋大海里。
    全国亿万军民在我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大时刻，重温毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席《人民战争胜利万岁》一文，对于毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大教导，体会深刻。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”这是中国无产阶级和世界无产阶级用鲜血换来的经验总结。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下，掌握了这个真理，开辟了一条胜利的道路，全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民要想取得真正的解放，也必须用毛主席关于人民战争的理论来武装自己，走这条通向胜利的道路，用枪杆子打碎旧的国家机器，用枪杆子打倒帝国主义及其走狗，用枪杆子改造整个世界。一些曾经跟随伟大统帅毛主席南征北战许多年的老红军战士，战斗英雄，在历次革命战争中高举起武装革命大旗的老革命根据地的民兵英雄们，还以他们的亲身经历说明毛主席的人民战争的伟大思想，是战胜以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器，是战胜以苏共为中心的现代修正主义的强大思想武器，是指导世界革命人民进行武装斗争、求得真正解放的光辉灯塔。他们以毛主席的军事思想为武器，进一步对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在各地党内、军内的代理人，一贯反对毛主席，反对革命武装斗争，反对无产阶级掌握枪杆子，鼓吹议会道路，大搞投降主义等滔天罪行展开了革命大批判，决心把他们过去所执行的彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义路线，彻底批深批透、批倒批臭。武汉地区陆海空军广大指战员和无产阶级革命派，在穷追猛打中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人的凯歌声中表示，毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席《人民战争胜利万岁》的发表，给我们送来了批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人的最锐利的武器，我们一定要认真地学习，很好地掌握这个粉碎资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的强大思想武器，牢牢掌握枪杆子，结成以革命左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，掀起革命的大批判的新高潮，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在武汉地区的代理人通通消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中，保证我国千秋万代永不变色。
    各地军民在学习毛主席论人民战争的语录和林副主席《人民战争胜利万岁》中，进一步认识到林副主席是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生。空军直属机关无产阶级革命派的同志和战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的许多部队的指战员们说，林副主席对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最好，对毛泽东思想领会得最深。几十年来，他一贯最忠实、最坚定、最彻底地执行和保卫毛主席的革命路线和军事思想。
    《人民战争胜利万岁》这篇光辉著作，系统地阐明了和创造性地发挥了毛主席的军事思想，是活学活用毛主席著作的光辉典范。他们一致表示，在学习毛主席伟大军事思想时，坚决学习林副主席活学活用毛主席著作的光辉榜样，最坚决地站在毛主席革命路线一边，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在革命大批判中，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们所推行的资产阶级反动军事路线的流毒，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，为把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
    现在，陆海空军广大指战员和各地无产阶级革命派的战士们正在进一步安排深入学习毛主席的军事思想。他们指出，毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我军战无不胜的力量源泉，是我军永不变质的保证，也是我们无产阶级革命战士的命根子。我们要想在革命斗争中不迷失方向，不断从胜利走向新的胜利，根本的根本，就是要以对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的深厚感情，掀起一个更加深入广泛的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，真正做到把毛泽东思想铭刻在脑海里，溶化在血液中，落实到革命斗争的行动上，永远沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进。首都广大无产阶级革命派和许多大专院校的红卫兵小将，武汉“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“三司革联”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”的革命小将，青海“八·一八”，山东革命工人造反总部，呼和浩特红卫兵第三司令部，以及许多部队指战员都在学习毛主席论人民战争的语录的座谈会上指出，毛主席的人民战争思想，不仅是革命武装斗争的指南，也是无产阶级革命派政治斗争的指南。我们一定要时刻牢记毛主席的教导，把最大多数的革命群众最大限度地动员起来，组织起来，开展革命的大批判，把党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底干净地扔进历史的垃圾堆里去。让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远照耀着我们胜利前进。
