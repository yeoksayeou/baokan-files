Comrade Wang Fen of our class is known throughout the entire school for committing serious errors. During the Cultural Revolution, she carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, striking at the proletarian revolutionary masses. How should we deal with such a person? Should we despise and ignore them? Or should we patiently persuade and educate them? Based on Chairman Mao's teachings on strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions, we analyzed the situation and concluded that although Comrade Wang Fen committed serious errors, she is still a contradiction within the people. We should actively help her return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We went to her home and, with sincere enthusiasm, expressed our hopes and attitudes to her parents and to her personally. We hoped to unite with her and together direct our spears at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. However, she rejected our help and fled to Xi'an. We firmly went to her home several times, gaining the support of her parents, and brought her back to the class. However, she still did not recognize her errors.

At that time, some of our comrades had incorrect thoughts about her persistent errors. Some said: "After all, her errors are serious. Since she doesn't admit them, we won't be polite either!" When this thought emerged, we felt it was wrong and organized a study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "Communist Party members should not adopt an exclusionary attitude towards those who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption. Instead, they should adopt an attitude of persuasion, helping them to reform and start anew." We realized that we should adopt the spirit of "punishing past errors to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" with a sincere attitude and patient work to save Comrade Wang Fen, and absolutely not push her to the enemy's side.

On one hand, we strictly demanded of ourselves, and in front of the entire class, including Comrade Wang Fen, we conducted self-criticism, examining our incorrect thoughts and expressing our sincere attitude. On the other hand, we seriously pointed out the severity of Comrade Wang Fen's errors.

We also combined the situation of the Cultural Revolution nationwide and within the school, using living examples to educate her, hoping she would face her errors. In this way, she gradually realized the severity of her errors.

Chairman Mao said: "A thorough change in worldview takes a very long time. We should patiently do the work and not be impatient." Comrade Wang Fen's realization of the severity of her errors did not mean she had corrected them. To help her, based on the situation at the time, we organized Red Flag soldiers to denounce the brutal persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, expressing our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Guo Jiaomu with Comrade Wang Fen, inspiring her class feelings and raising her class consciousness. At the same time, based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "not establishing without destroying," we exposed and criticized her serious errors. Classmates used their personal experiences to educate her, making her feel that she had taken the wrong stand, directing her spear at her class brothers, and causing harm to the revolutionary cause. Apart from this, we also used individual conversations to encourage her, discuss her future, probe her thoughts, and find the root cause, making her think about the persecution her class brothers suffered and compare it with her own errors. We also let her study with the Red Flag soldiers, criticizing "Revisionism," directing her spear at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Through long-term patient work, Comrade Wang Fen finally returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. She began to recognize her errors, expressed her determination to correct her errors and join the revolution, and applied to join the Red Flag Combat Team. We put forward further requirements for Comrade Wang Fen, hoping she could further break "private" and establish "public," thoroughly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The process of educating Comrade Wang Fen is also a process of "unity-criticism-unity." From the beginning, we expressed our desire for unity with her and did not despise her for her serious errors. At the same time, in helping her, we did not indulge her errors but seriously exposed and criticized them. After more than half a year of ideological struggle, we and Comrade Wang Fen finally achieved new unity on a new basis. As a Red Flag soldier said: "The bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the biggest power-holder within the Party taking the capitalist road split us apart, and now Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has united us again." Through the example of winning over and educating Comrade Wang Fen, we realized:

First, we must, as pointed out in the "Sixteen Points," strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions and not treat contradictions within the people as contradictions between the enemy and us. This is especially important for dealing with comrades like Wang Fen who have committed serious errors. If not handled properly, it is easy to confuse the boundaries of contradictions. We must see both her errors and her good points. We believe that she has a good background, has been educated by the Party for many years, and emotionally loves the Party and Chairman Mao. This is a favorable condition for helping her correct her errors.

Second, we must strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to correctly handle contradictions within the people. We should actively, enthusiastically, and wholeheartedly help her recognize her errors, and also critically criticize her errors with a serious attitude. Practice has proven that unity without struggle is not enough. For example, the first time we went to her home, we only talked about unity without criticism, so she could not recognize her own errors. However, if we only talk about struggle, it is also not enough. Only by strictly grasping and using the method of "unity-criticism-unity," deeply understanding the dialectical relationship between struggle and unity, can we correctly handle contradictions within the people.

Third, we must truly understand in our minds what Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: we must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. To achieve this, we must break "private" and establish "public," strictly demand of ourselves. For example, when we found erroneous thoughts in dealing with Comrade Wang Fen, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on how to deal with comrades who have made mistakes: "We must also be good at uniting those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." We publicly conducted self-criticism and conducted more in-depth, detailed, and patient ideological work. In this way, good results were achieved. We thus realized that only by establishing a proletarian worldview can we have the broad-mindedness to liberate all of humanity, correctly grasp the method of "unity-criticism-unity," handle contradictions within the people well, and unite with all those who can be united.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the care of the central leadership, in the process of helping Comrade Wang Fen, our class's Red Flag soldiers have made progress, but we must continue to break "private" and establish "public," guiding petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the proletarian track, forever following Chairman Mao forward in great waves!

    我们是如何帮助王芬同志的
    北航红旗战斗队四五一一支队
    我班王芬同志是全院人所共知的犯有严重错误的同志。她在文化大革命当中，曾经执行资产阶级反动路线，打击无产阶级革命派。对于这种人，我们该怎么办？是鄙弃不管？还是耐心地说服教育？我们根据毛主席关于严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾的教导，经过分析，认为王芬同志虽然犯了严重错误，但还是人民内部矛盾。我们应当主动地帮助她回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    于是，我们到她家里去，对她的父母和对她本人，满腔热情地表示了我们的希望和态度。希望同她团结起来，共同把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。不料她拒绝了我们的帮助，跑到西安去了。我们坚定不移地几次到她家去，取得她父母的帮助，使她回到了班上。但是，她对自己的错误仍然没有认识。
    当时，对她如此坚持自己的错误，我们的同志之中产生了一些不正确的想法，有人认为：反正她的错误够严重的了，她既然不认账，我们也不客气了！这种思想苗头一出现，我们就觉得不对头，便组织起来学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”我们认识到应该本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神，以诚恳的态度和耐心的工作来挽救王芬同志，绝不能把她向敌人方面推。
    我们一方面严格要求自己，当着全班同学的面，也包括王芬同志在内，进行自我批评，检讨了不正确的想法，表示了我们的恳切态度；另一方面，我们严肃地指出王芬同志错误的严重性。
    我们还结合当时全国和院内文化大革命形势，用活生生的例子来教育她，希望她正视自己的错误。这样，逐渐使她意识到自己错误的严重性了。
    毛主席说：“世界观的彻底改变需要一个很长的时间，我们应当耐心地做工作，不能急躁。”王芬同志意识到了错误的严重性，并不等于她改正了自己的错误。为了帮助她，我们根据当时运动的情况，组织红旗战士控诉资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害，表达我们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚；我们同王芬同志一起学习郭嘉宏烈士的光荣事迹，以激发她的阶级感情，提高她的阶级觉悟。同时，我们根据毛主席“不破不立”的教导，揭发和批判她所犯的严重错误。同学们以自己的亲身经历来教育她，使她感到站错了立场，把矛头对准了自己的阶级弟兄，对革命事业带来了损害。除此以外，我们还以个别谈话的方式，对她提希望，摆前途，挖思想，查根源，使她想到自己的阶级弟兄所受的迫害，对照自己的错误。我们还让她和红旗战士一起批《修养》，把矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。通过长时间的耐心工作，王芬同志终于回到毛主席的革命路线上来了。她开始认识到自己的错误，表示了改正错误、起来闹革命的决心，并且申请加入红旗战斗队。我们对王芬又提出要求，希望她能更进一步破“私”立“公”，彻底回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    我们教育王芬同志的过程，也就是“团结——批评——团结”的过程。一开始，我们就对她表示了团结的愿望，不因为她犯了严重的错误就鄙弃她；同时，我们在帮助她的过程中，又没有姑息她的错误，而是认真地揭发和严肃地批判。经过了半年多的思想斗争，我们和王芬同志终于在新的基础上达到了新的团结。这正如一个红旗战士说的那样：“过去党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线把我们分开了，现在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线又让我们团结起来了。”我们通过争取教育王芬同志的例子认识到：
    第一、我们必须象《十六条》指出的那样，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，不能把人民内部矛盾当成敌我矛盾。这一点，对处理象王芬这种犯有严重错误的同志尤为重要。如果处理不好，很容易混淆矛盾的界限。我们既要看到她错误的一面，也要看到她好的一面。我们认为她出身好，受党多年教育，在感情上还是热爱党和毛主席的。这是帮助她改正错误的有利条件。
    第二、我们必须严格按照毛主席的教导，用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾。我们应主动、积极、热忱地帮助她认识错误，又要以严肃的态度批判她的错误。实践证明，只有团结没有斗争是不行的，例如第一次我们到她家去，只讲团结，没有批评，就不能使她认识自己的错误。但是如果只是一味讲斗争也不行。只有不折不扣地掌握和运用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，深刻地领会斗争与团结的辩证关系，才能正确处理人民内部矛盾。
    第三、我们要真正从思想上认识到毛主席一再教导我们的：必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。要做到这一点，就要破“私”立“公”，严格要求自己。例如当我们一发现在对待王芬同志问题上有错误思想时，就学习了毛主席有关如何对待犯错误的同志的教导：“还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”，我们公开作了自我批评，并且更加深入、细致、耐心地进行思想工作。这样就收到了良好的效果。我们从而认识到，只有树立无产阶级世界观，才能有解放全人类的广阔的胸怀，才能正确掌握“团结——批评——团结”的方法，处理好人民内部矛盾，团结一切可以团结的人们。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在中央首长的关怀下，在帮助王芬同志的过程中，我们班红旗战士虽然前进了一步，但是我们还要不断地破“私”立“公”，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级轨道上来，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪里奋勇前进！
