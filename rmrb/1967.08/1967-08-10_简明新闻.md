	U.S.-South Vietnamese Puppet Forces and Thai Troops Invade Cambodia

	Recently, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces and Thai armed forces have repeatedly invaded Cambodian territory and waters and were repelled by Cambodian defenders. On July 9, 10, and 17, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet ground troops and marine infantry invaded the Cambodian borders of Kampong Cham, Takeo, and Pursat provinces three times.

	From June 17 and from July 3 to 19, Thai troops, warships, and aircraft provoked Cambodian positions in Chang Yang and Chik Sa villages in Kampong Cham province nine times. The Cambodian armed forces retaliated against the invaders.

	Large Numbers of South Vietnamese Puppet Soldiers Desert and Surrender

	Under the heavy blows of the liberation forces, the morale of the broad masses of soldiers in the South Vietnamese puppet army is low and their spirits are scattered. Large numbers of soldiers have deserted or surrendered with weapons to the liberation forces. In the past six months of last winter and this spring, 13,800 people from the puppet army in the central region of South Vietnam surrendered with a large number of weapons to the liberation forces or local people's governments. Nearly 10,000 people deserted in the first quarter of this year. In the first quarter of this year, 5,000 people from the puppet army in the western region of South Vietnam surrendered with weapons, and 3,000 people deserted during the Spring Festival this year.

	U.S. Gold Reserves Decrease by Over $40 Million

	The Federal Reserve Board of the United States announced that the U.S. gold reserves decreased by $45 million in June, falling to $13.169 billion. The gold reserves have decreased by $66 million in the first half of this year.

	The continuous decrease in U.S. gold reserves indicates that the dollar's position as the king of the capitalist world is continuing to weaken.
