In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province, who have undergone arduous struggles, and the support-left troops in Wenzhou, enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people." They have carried out extensive activities to support the army and love the people, and the soldiers and civilians support each other, learn from each other, and are closely united in harmony.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on the 30th, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Wenzhou City, who have undergone arduous struggles, and the support-left troops in Wenzhou, enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people." They have carried out extensive activities to support the army and love the people, and the soldiers and civilians support each other, learn from each other, and are closely united in harmony.

In the fierce struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Wenzhou City firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, fight bravely and tenaciously, and vow to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During their arduous and difficult struggles, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin sent the 6517th and 6299th units of the People's Liberation Army to Wenzhou. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of these two units held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood firmly and clearly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary factions. They organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and went deep into the masses to protect the proletarian revolutionary factions and encourage the revolutionary fighters to fight more tenaciously against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The clear stance of the support-left troops greatly inspired the revolutionary factions. The broad revolutionary masses regard the support-left troops as their own family and send batch after batch of performance teams to the troops' stations to perform programs they have rehearsed, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and sincerely thanking the People's Liberation Army; they send letter after letter of condolences, thanks, and respect to the soldiers and officers, expressing the revolutionary fighters' heartfelt love for the People's Liberation Army. With the support and help of the support-left troops, the revolutionary factions of the Wenzhou Port Bureau, together with the soldiers, guard the port, wharf, ships, and warehouses, prevent bad elements from damaging state property, and ensure that the revolution and production continue to achieve new victories. The proletarian revolutionary fighters say, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people.' Your protection and support are our reliable guarantee for seizing the revolution and promoting production."

The broad proletarian revolutionary factions of Wenzhou City extensively carried out activities to learn from the People's Liberation Army. Many units invited officers and soldiers of the support-left troops to give lectures on studying Chairman Mao's works and learned from the experiences of the People's Liberation Army to establish the system of studying Chairman Mao's works every day.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the support-left troops also humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions, invite them to introduce their heroic struggle stories, listen to their opinions, and are determined to unite with them, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

    温州市军民心连心
    无产阶级革命派和支左部队，深入开展拥军爱民活动，军民互相支持，互相学习，亲密团结，融洽无间
    据新华社杭州三十日电　在无产阶级文化大革命中，经过艰苦斗争考验的浙江省温州市无产阶级革命派，和在温州的支左部队，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的号召，深入开展拥军爱民活动，军民之间亲密团结，融洽无间，到处呈现着军爱民，民拥军，军民心连心的革命景象。
    温州市无产阶级革命派在和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的激烈斗争中，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，英勇顽强，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在他们斗争艰苦困难的时刻，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席派来了中国人民解放军六五一七部队、六二九九部队。这两支部队广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地站在无产阶级革命派一边，同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗。他们组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，分别深入到群众中，保护无产阶级革命派，鼓舞革命派战士更加顽强地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争。
    支左部队的鲜明态度，给了革命派极大的鼓舞。广大革命群众把支左部队看作是自己的亲人，派出一批批慰问队到部队驻地演出自己排练的节目，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，衷心感谢亲人解放军；发出一封封慰问信、感谢信、致敬信，送到指战员手里，表达革命派战士对人民解放军的衷心热爱。温州港务局革命派在支左部队的支持和帮助下，军民一起保卫港口、码头、船只、仓库，防止坏人破坏国家财产，使革命和生产不断取得新胜利。无产阶级革命派战士们说，毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”你们的保卫和支持，是我们抓革命、促生产的坚强可靠的保障。
    温州市广大无产阶级革命派，广泛开展了向解放军学习的活动。许多单位邀请支左部队的干部战士作学习毛主席著作的辅导报告，并且学习解放军的经验，建立了天天读毛主席著作的制度。
    支左部队广大指战员也虚心向无产阶级革命派学习，请他们介绍英勇斗争事迹，听取他们的意见，决心同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
