Comrade Samugathasan highly praises the armed struggles of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples.
Only by taking the road of armed struggle can one achieve thorough liberation.
Chairman Mao's instruction that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is the essence of Marxism-Leninism.

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Ceylon Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau member and Secretariat member Samugathasan wrote in the article "The General Strike and Its Lessons for the Left Movement" published in the August 13 issue of the "Red Flag" Weekly that: "Our party condemns the parliamentary democracy fraud of the bourgeoisie and calls on the people to accept the revolutionary future and prepare to take revolutionary action as the only way to liberate themselves from the shackles of imperialism and capitalism."

	Samugathasan condemned the Ceylon revisionist group led by N. M. Perera and the reformists in Ceylon for completely betraying the working class and the revolutionary movement. "They have always poured cold water on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and resolutely opposed any form of revolutionary activity by the masses. In fact, they have become the agents of the bourgeoisie within the workers' movement." He stressed that Chairman Mao's instruction that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is "the essence of Marxism-Leninism." Samugathasan also quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

	He highly praised the armed struggles of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said: Today, around us, on the Asian continent, the flames of revolution are already burning. The people of Africa and Latin America have also risen up in rebellion. Vietnam is the best example, where the heroic people are waging a revolutionary people's war against the strongest imperialist country. In India, the red flag has been raised, and a revolutionary armed area has been established in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, where the long-suffering peasants have risen up in rebellion. This is like a spring thunder that echoes across the entire Indian subcontinent. In other countries, such as Burma, Laos, Thailand, Malaya, and the Philippines, the people are also waging armed struggles against imperialism and reactionaries. He said: "All these important signs indicate that revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, and the people will no longer be deceived by the opium of 'non-violence' or 'parliamentary road.' The oppressed peoples of the world are beginning to realize that only through violent revolution and armed struggle can they achieve thorough liberation." He went on to say, this means "boldly arousing the peasant masses, establishing and expanding revolutionary armed forces, persisting in protracted armed struggle, using the countryside to encircle the cities, and finally seizing the cities, in order to deal with the temporary superiority of imperialism and reactionary armed suppression."

    桑穆加塔桑同志高度赞扬亚非拉人民武装斗争
    只有走武装斗争道路才能彻底解放
    毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导是马列主义精华
    新华社科伦坡十四日电　锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑十三日在《红旗》周刊上发表题为《全国大罢工及其给左翼运动的教训》的文章说：“我党谴责资产阶级议会民主的骗局，并号召人民接受革命的前途和准备采取革命行动以作为从帝国主义和资本主义的枷锁下取得解放的唯一途径。”
    桑穆加塔桑谴责锡兰克尼曼修正主义集团和锡兰改良主义者完全背叛了工人阶级和革命运动。“他们一贯向群众的革命热情泼冷水，他们坚决反对让群众准备进行任何形式的革命活动。事实上，他们变成了资产阶级在工人运动内部的代理人。”他强调指出，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导是“马克思列宁主义的精华”。桑穆加塔桑还引用毛主席的一段话：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    他高度赞扬亚、非、拉革命人民所进行的人民武装斗争。他说：今天，在我们周围，在亚洲大陆，已经燃烧起革命的烈火。非洲和拉丁美洲人民也起来造反了。越南是个最好的榜样，那里英雄的人民正在进行革命的人民战争，反对最强大的帝国主义国家。在印度，红旗已经升起，在西孟加拉邦的大吉岭县建立了革命武装地区，那里长期受苦的农民已起来造反。这象一声春雷，响彻了整个印度大地。在其他国家，象缅甸、老挝、泰国、马来亚、菲律宾，人民也正在进行反对帝国主义和反动派的武装斗争。他说：“这一切重要的迹象表明，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，人民再也不受‘非暴力’或‘议会道路’这种鸦片的欺骗了。全世界被压迫的人民开始认识到，只有依靠暴力革命和走武装斗争的道路，才能获得彻底解放。”他接着说，这就意味着“大胆地唤起农民群众，建立和扩大革命武装力量，坚持持久的武装斗争，用农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，以此来对付暂时还比革命力量强大的帝国主义和反动派的武装镇压。”
