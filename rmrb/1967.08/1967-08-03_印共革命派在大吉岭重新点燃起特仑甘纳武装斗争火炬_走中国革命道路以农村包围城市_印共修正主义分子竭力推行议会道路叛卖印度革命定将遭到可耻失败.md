Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India (CPI) has relit and raised high the torch of armed struggle in the Darjeeling district of the Nasalbari region, which was previously extinguished by the CPI's revisionists. This is a significant victory for the CPI's revolutionary faction in its struggle against revisionism.

For a long time, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines within the CPI, with the focus being on whether the Indian revolution should follow the path of armed struggle or the parliamentary road. The revolutionary faction within the CPI firmly advocates for seizing political power through armed struggle, expressing their determination to follow the path led by the great leader Chairman Mao, which led the Chinese people to victory in their revolution. However, some revisionist leaders have been vigorously promoting the revisionist parliamentary road, causing great harm to the Indian revolution.

From 1946 to 1951, under the efforts of many CPI members and the broad masses, an armed struggle base was established in the Telangana region (now part of Andhra Pradesh), where the landless and land-poor peasants seized land through armed struggle, becoming a banner for the people's revolutionary struggle in India at that time. However, the armed struggle in Telangana was later extinguished due to the betrayal of the revisionists. For many years, these revisionists created numerous fallacies, claiming that India could "peacefully transition" to socialism, that Indian conditions were different from those in China, that the time for armed revolution in India was not yet ripe, and that the form of armed struggle was not suitable for India, etc., all to cover up their promotion of the revisionist parliamentary road and attempt to lead the Indian revolution astray.

After a long struggle with the CPI's revisionists, the revolutionary faction has finally emerged, relighting and raising high the torch of armed struggle in the Nasalbari region of the Darjeeling district, which was previously extinguished by the CPI's revisionists. This is a significant victory for the CPI's revolutionary faction in its struggle against revisionism.

The armed struggle in Telangana, India, from 1946 to 1951, developed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Telangana is a region in the northeastern part of Andhra Pradesh (then part of the eastern region of the Hyderabad princely state). It covers an area of 44,000 square miles with a population of over 10 million. The local peasants had long suffered from the brutal exploitation of British imperialism and feudal forces. Half of the land was owned by princes and nobles, and the rest was mostly owned by large landlords. More than 50% of the peasants had no land at all. The people lived under a tyrannical regime, leading a life worse than that of cattle.

The people of Telangana had a glorious tradition of struggle. In the 1930s and early 1940s, there were mass struggles against feudal exploitation. The influence of the CPI among the peasants continued to expand. The CPI-led mass organization, the Andhra Conference, developed to more than 100,000 members by 1946.

The armed uprising began in June 1946 in the Sayyabet region of Nalgonda district. At that time, a worker of the Andhra Conference was killed by a landlord, which aroused great indignation among the peasants. Under the leadership of the CPI, they rose up to seize the land and weapons of the landlords. The revolutionary storm quickly spread. Peasants everywhere established village people's committees and volunteer corps to resist the 30,000 troops of the Nizam.

By the end of 1947, the uprising had spread to 300 villages. Later, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the armed struggle surged even higher. The local CPI organization resolutely followed the path of the Chinese revolution. By September 1948, the uprising had spread throughout Telangana, covering about 3,000 villages and nearly 3 million people, establishing a red political power. The guerrilla forces developed to 2,000 people, and the village militias reached 10,000. Land reform was carried out in the liberated areas, confiscating 6 million acres of land from the landlords and distributing it free of charge to the landless and land-poor peasants. For the first time, the peasants of Telangana stood up. The Nizam dynasty was on the verge of collapse.

The Nehru government initially only supplied the Nizam with weapons to suppress the peasant uprising. Later, seeing that the Nizam was on the verge of collapse, it sent tens of thousands of troops to invade Hyderabad in September 1948, committing atrocities in the Telangana region, burning and looting villages, and massacring peasants. More than 100,000 peasants were arrested, tortured, and killed.

Facing the superior enemy, the peasant guerrilla forces, due to lack of military experience and the wavering of some leaders, suffered a temporary setback. However, with the broad support of the masses, they quickly regained their strength and continued the fight. Some guerrilla forces moved to vast forest areas to continue the struggle. Some guerrilla forces, after being suppressed, soon resumed activities. New guerrilla areas were established in the coastal counties of Andhra. From 1948 to 1951, the Congress Party's military suppression could not extinguish the flames of armed revolution in Telangana.

After 1949, especially from 1950 to 1951, the guerrilla forces adopted flexible tactics to strike the enemy, including ambushing enemy troops, blowing up enemy vehicles, attacking ammunition depots, and attacking police stations. In just the three months from October to December 1950, they carried out 344 such combat operations. By the end of 1950, the guerrilla forces had established contact with the masses in 300 villages in the Karinaga district. In early 1951, the guerrilla forces were active in more than 100 villages in the coastal counties of Andhra. Until the end of 1951, the Congress Party's army still dared not enter the mountainous areas of Telangana.

In October 1950, Telangana and the northern Andhra region of Madras established a vast guerrilla zone covering 40,000 square miles and 10 million people.

The brilliant achievements of the armed struggle in Telangana had a profound impact on the peasant struggles in various parts of India. From 1946 to 1951, armed peasant struggles broke out in Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur, and the Garo Hills of Assam, shining in tandem with Telangana.

The armed struggle in Telangana was consistently opposed and sabotaged by the anti-revolutionary revisionists within the CPI. They first slandered the armed struggle as "disrupting the united front." Later, they attacked the advocacy of following the path of the Chinese revolution as the "theory of peasant leadership." A small group of extremely reactionary revisionists, led by Danji, openly slandered the peasant armed struggle as "adventurism" and "individual terrorism," deliberately betraying the armed struggle in Telangana. In September 1950, they submitted a so-called "opinion paper" within the CPI, and in 1951, they publicly issued a statement slandering the people's revolutionary war led by Chairman Mao, proposing the "Indian exceptionalism" theory, and fiercely opposing the Indian people following the path of the Chinese revolution.

In June 1951, under the control of this small group of revisionists, the CPI Central Committee issued the "Resolution on Resolving the Telangana Struggle through Negotiations," using the pretext of "restoring peace in the Telangana region" to openly beg the Congress Party government for negotiations. In July, they eagerly sent a delegation to Hyderabad to negotiate with the local government. The delegation begged the government to accept two minimum conditions for stopping the armed struggle: first, stopping the seizure of peasant land; second, granting amnesty to the guerrilla forces. The result was completely rejected by the local government. The CPI Central Committee then issued a unilateral surrender statement in October: "Decided to advise the peasants and fighting guerrilla forces in the Telangana region to stop all guerrilla activities and mobilize all the people to actually participate in the upcoming general election, and defeat the Congress Party in the election."

Thus, the armed struggle in Telangana was betrayed. This was followed by the Indian reactionaries carrying out large-scale arrests, imprisonment, and massacres of revolutionary peasants. The victories achieved by the revolutionary peasants in the armed struggle were all lost.

For more than a decade, the armed struggle of the peasants in Telangana left a deep lesson and far-reaching influence among the Indian people who urgently demand liberation. After experiencing countless setbacks and great sacrifices, the Indian people gradually realized that the parliamentary road advocated by the CPI revisionists, who wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, was a road of complete betrayal and destruction of the Indian revolution. The Indian people want true liberation and must follow the path of the great leader Chairman Mao, who led the Chinese revolution to victory. This is the path of the vanguard of the proletariat going deep into the countryside, leading the peasants in armed struggle, establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing national political power. Only in this way can the Indian people overthrow the imperialism, Soviet revisionism, feudalism, and bureaucratic comprador capitalism that weigh heavily on the Indian people, truly stand up, and become the masters of the country.

Now, the revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary peasants in the Nasalbari region of the Darjeeling district have relit the torch of armed struggle, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampening the arrogance of the Indian reactionaries. The Indian reactionaries are extremely shocked, exclaiming that this is a "repetition of the Telangana-style movement of the early years of independence."

    印共革命派在大吉岭重新点燃起特仑甘纳武装斗争火炬
    走中国革命道路以农村包围城市
    印共修正主义分子竭力推行议会道路叛卖印度革命定将遭到可耻失败
    新华社一日讯　本社记者评述：长期以来，印度共产党内两条路线斗争十分激烈，斗争的焦点是印度革命究竟应该走什么道路这个关系到印度革命成败的关键问题。印共党内革命派坚决主张武装夺取政权，表示要走伟大的领袖毛主席领导中国人民取得革命胜利的道路，而某些修正主义头目，却极力推行修正主义的议会道路，给印度革命造成了极大的危害。
    从一九四六年至一九五一年，在许多印度共产党人和广大群众的努力下，在特仑甘纳地区（现属安得拉邦），就曾经建立过武装斗争根据地，发动广大无地少地农民武装夺取土地，成为当时印度人民革命斗争的一面旗帜。但是，特仑甘纳的武装斗争，后来由于修正主义分子的叛卖而被扑灭了。多年以来，这些修正主义分子制造了许多谬论，胡说什么印度可以“和平过渡”到社会主义，印度条件和中国不一样，印度武装革命的时机还没有成熟，武装斗争形式不适用于印度等等，来为他们推行修正主义的议会道路打掩护，力图把印度革命引入歧途。
    印共革命派经过同印共修正主义分子的长期斗争，终于杀了出来，在大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里地区重新点燃了并且更高地举起了被印共修正主义分子扑灭的武装斗争的火炬。这是印共革命派在反对修正主义斗争中所取得的重大胜利。
    一九四六年至一九五一年的印度特仑甘纳武装斗争，是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下发展起来的。特仑甘纳是印度东南方安得拉邦北部的一个地区（当时是海德拉巴土邦东部的一个地区）。面积四万四千平方英里。人口一千多万。当地农民长期遭受英帝国主义和封建势力的野蛮剥削。土地一半为王公贵族所有，其余大部分为大地主所有。百分之五十以上的农民完全没有土地。人民处于专制暴政之下，过着牛马般的生活。
    特仑甘纳人民有着光荣的斗争传统。三十年代和四十年代初期，这里就爆发过反对封建剥削的群众斗争。印度共产党在农民中的影响不断扩大。印共领导的群众组织安得拉大会在一九四六年发展到十万余人。
    武装起义于一九四六年六月首先在拿尔岗达县沙耶别特地区爆发。当时，安得拉大会的一名工作人员被地主杀害，引起农民极大愤慨。他们在印度共产党人领导下起来夺取地主的土地和枪支。革命风暴迅速蔓延。农民到处建立起村人民委员会和人民志愿队，抗击尼萨姆土王的三万军队。
    一九四七年底，起义地区扩展到三百个村庄。其后，武装斗争浪潮在毛泽东思想指引下越加高涨。印共地方组织坚决走中国革命的道路。一九四八年九月，起义地区遍及特仑甘纳全境，约有三千个村庄，近三百万人口的地区建立起红色政权。游击队发展到了二千人，各村民兵达一万人。解放了的地区进行了土地改革，没收地主六百万亩土地，无偿地分配给无地少地农民。特仑甘纳农民破天荒第一次翻了身。尼萨姆王朝摇摇欲坠。
    印度尼赫鲁政权起初只是供给尼萨姆军火来镇压农民起义。后来看到尼萨姆面临崩溃，它就在一九四八年九月出动数万军队侵入海德拉巴，在特仑甘纳地区大肆烧杀劫掠，血洗村庄。被逮捕、拷打、折磨的农民达一百万人以上。
    在优势的敌人面前，农民游击队由于军事上缺乏经验和部分领导人的动摇，暂时遭到挫折。但在群众的广泛支持下，他们迅速恢复了力量，坚持战斗。有些游击队转移到广大森林地带继续作战。有些游击队被镇压后不久又重新恢复活动。在安得拉沿海各县还建立了新的游击地区。从一九四八年到一九五一年，国大党的武力镇压一直无法扑灭特仑甘纳武装革命的火焰。
    一九四九年后，特别是在一九五○年到一九五一年，游击队采取机动灵活的战术打击敌人，包括伏击敌军，炸毁敌军车辆，袭击军火仓库，袭击警察署等。仅在一九五○年十月至十二月间，就进行了三百四十四次这样的战斗行动。一九五○年末在卡林那加县，游击队已同三百个村庄的群众建立了联系。一九五一年初在安得拉沿海县份，游击队在一百多个村庄中展开活动。直到一九五一年末，国大党军队还不敢进入特仑甘纳的山区。
    在一九五○年十月，特仑甘纳和马德拉斯北部安得拉地区建立了包括四万平方英里和一千万人口的广大游击区。
    特仑甘纳武装斗争的光辉成就，对印度各地的农民斗争有着深刻的影响。从一九四六年至一九五一年，在喀拉拉、西孟加拉、北方邦、特里普拉、曼尼普尔和阿萨姆的加洛山区，先后爆发了农民武装斗争，与特仑甘纳互相辉映。
    特仑甘纳的武装斗争，一直遭到印共反革命修正主义分子的反对和破坏。他们始则污蔑武装斗争“破坏统一战线”。后来又攻击走中国革命道路的主张是什么“农民领导权”的理论。丹吉等一小撮极端反动的修正主义分子，公开污蔑农民武装斗争是“冒险主义”、“个人恐怖主义”，蓄意出卖特仑甘纳武装斗争。一九五○年九月，他们在印共党内提出所谓“意见书”，又于一九五一年公开发表声明，污蔑毛主席领导的中国人民革命战争，提出“印度特殊论”，疯狂反对印度人民走中国革命道路。
    一九五一年六月，在这一小撮修正主义分子控制下的印共中央发表《关于以谈判解决特仑甘纳斗争的决议》，在“恢复特仑甘纳地区的和平状态”的借口下，公开向国大党政府乞求谈判。七月，他们迫不及待地遣派代表团前往海德拉巴与当地政府谈判。代表团在谈判中乞求政府接受停止武装斗争的两个最低条件，即：一、停止夺取农民土地；二、对游击队实行大赦。结果完全遭到当地政府拒绝。印共中央就在十月单方面发表投降声明：“决定劝告特仑甘纳地区的农民和战斗的游击队停止一切游击活动，并动员全体人民实际参加即将到来的大选，在选举中击败国大党。”
    特仑甘纳武装斗争就这样被出卖了。跟着是印度反动派对革命农民进行大规模的逮捕、监禁和屠杀。革命农民在武装斗争中夺到的胜利果实也全都丧失掉了。
    十多年来，特仑甘纳农民英勇的武装斗争，在迫切要求解放的印度人民当中留下了深刻的教训和深远的影响。印度人民在经受了无数的挫折和重大牺牲以后，逐步认识到，那些披着马克思列宁主义外衣的印共修正主义分子所宣扬的“在选举中击败国大党”的议会道路，是一条彻头彻尾叛卖印度革命、葬送印度革命的道路。印度人民要求得真正解放，只有走伟大的领袖毛主席领导中国革命胜利的道路，这就是无产阶级先锋队深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国政权的革命道路。只有这样，印度人民才能推翻帝国主义、苏联修正主义、封建主义、官僚买办资本主义这几座压在印度人民头上的大山，真正翻身做国家的主人。
    现在，印度共产党革命派和革命农民在大吉岭县的纳萨尔巴里地区重新点燃起了武装斗争的火焰，它大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了印度反动派的威风。印度反动派对此感到十分震惊，惊呼这是“独立最初几年的特仑甘纳式运动的重演”。
