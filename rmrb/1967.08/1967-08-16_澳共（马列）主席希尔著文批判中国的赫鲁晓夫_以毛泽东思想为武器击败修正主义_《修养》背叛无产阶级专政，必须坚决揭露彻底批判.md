	Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) Chairman Hill recently published an article in the "Vanguard" criticizing China's Khrushchev. He emphasized that only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle can revisionism be defeated.

	The article points out: "The events that have taken place in the international communist movement and the emergence of China's Khrushchev indicate that the struggle against revisionism is a long-term and protracted one."

	The article states that the thoughts of China's Khrushchev have a significant influence and must be exposed and criticized using Marxism as a weapon. The article stresses, "Only revolutionary struggles guided by Mao Zedong Thought can eliminate this kind of thought."

	The article further points out that China's Khrushchev's book "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation" is "a tool to oppose proletarian dictatorship and to serve the imperialists and their agents."

	The article says that Lenin pointed out long ago, "Only those who acknowledge class struggle and proletarian dictatorship are Marxists."

	However, "China's Khrushchev in his book 'On the Practice of Self-Cultivation' does not mention proletarian dictatorship at all. He even deletes the part about proletarian dictatorship when quoting a passage from Lenin about proletarian dictatorship."

	The article points out that the book "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation" aims to portray communist party members as self-cultivators detached from revolutionary struggles, who do not need to engage in class struggles to overthrow capitalism and establish proletarian dictatorship.

	After seriously criticizing the revisionists in Australia, the article emphasizes: "We must not overlook the struggle against revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful antiseptic to eliminate all these poisons. Mao Zedong Thought will spread throughout the world, inspiring people's struggles."

	He said: "Undoubtedly, Mao Zedong Thought will be grasped by more and more people, helping the people in their revolutionary struggles to overthrow imperialism."

    以毛泽东思想为武器击败修正主义
    《修养》背叛无产阶级专政，必须坚决揭露彻底批判
    新华社墨尔本十三日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔最近在《先锋报》上发表文章，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫。他强调指出，只有以毛泽东思想为指导，才能击败修正主义。
    文章指出：“国际共产主义运动中所发生的事情和中国的赫鲁晓夫的出现表明，反修斗争是长期的和持久的。”
  文章说，中国的赫鲁晓夫的思想有很大的影响，必须把这种思想挖出来，用马克思主义作为批判的武器加以揭露。文章强调指出，“只有在毛泽东思想指导下的革命斗争才能消灭这种思想。”
    文章接着指出，中国的赫鲁晓夫的《修养》一书，“就是为不要无产阶级专政，为保持帝国主义及其代理人的政权效劳。”
    文章说，列宁很早就指出，“只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”
    但是，“中国的赫鲁晓夫在他的《修养》一书中，根本不提无产阶级专政。他甚至在引用关于无产阶级专政的一条列宁语录时，把引语中讲到无产阶级专政的一段也删掉了。”
    文章指出，《修养》这本书就是要把共产党员描写成为脱离革命斗争的自我修养者，他无需投身到推翻资本主义和建立无产阶级专政的阶级斗争中去。
    文章在对澳大利亚的修正主义者进行了严肃的批判后强调指出：“我们决不能无视反修斗争。毛泽东思想是消除这一切毒害的强烈的消毒剂。毛泽东思想将传遍全世界，鼓舞着人们的斗争。”
    他说：“毫无疑问，毛泽东思想将为越来越多的人所掌握，帮助人民在革命斗争中推翻帝国主义。”
