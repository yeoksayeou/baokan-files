From April 24 to May 1, in just eight days, we consecutively shot down five American aggressor aircraft. This is the result of air force soldiers, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, having established a constant state of readiness.

During a previous period, there were fewer enemy activities. To prevent any relaxation in our thinking, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The entire command and combat personnel of the People's Liberation Army must absolutely not relax their fighting spirit in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or of underestimating the enemy is wrong." We also held a meeting to share our understanding of this teaching. Since then, we have made this quote a regular and repeated study topic. Every time we hand over duty during combat readiness, we first hand over this quote, ensuring that Chairman Mao's directive is deeply rooted in the minds of every comrade, always thinking of the word "fight," and preparing in every way to annihilate the American air pirates.

To fundamentally strengthen our combat readiness, we used the struggle between the two lines as our guideline and "The Three Articles" as our weapon, organizing all comrades to launch a major criticism and denunciation of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Everyone recognized that the ultimate goal of this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is to restore capitalism in China, making the laboring people suffer twice. Some comrades said: The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries attack us from the outside, while the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road attack us from the inside. Their goals are the same—to attempt to change China's color. To make the plots of imperialism and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road completely fail, we must, with our actual actions of strengthening combat readiness and fighting well, defend Chairman Mao, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Whether it is night or day, in wind or rain, we stand alert on our combat posts. Even when there are multiple alerts in a single day, we are determined to "run a thousand times in vain, but never miss a single enemy." Our fighting spirit never relaxes; we always keep our hearts on the combat posts and our bodies nailed to the combat posts. Some comrades described this combat life as: "Always on the combat post, always studying Chairman Mao's works, when the enemy planes come, fiercely attack the enemy planes, when the enemy planes don't come, fiercely criticize 'Revisionism'."

In the battle on April 24, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for imperialism and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we shot down two invading enemy planes. In the face of victory, some comrades became complacent, thinking that the enemy was afraid and would not come again. We immediately restudied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Create disturbances, fail, create more disturbances, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." Comrades realized: The aggressive nature of the American pirates will never change until they are annihilated. As long as they do not perish, they will create disturbances. We must always be prepared in thought and action to "fight."

Because we have established the idea of continuous combat and constant readiness, on May 1, despite the complex situation and brief combat opportunity, we still achieved a glorious victory.

    时刻想到一个“打”字
    空军一等战斗功臣　吕尚华
    今年四月二十四日至五月一日，在八天时间里，我们接连打下了五架美国强盗飞机。这是空军战士在毛泽东思想哺育下，树立了常备不懈思想的结果。
    在前一段时间，敌情较少。为了防止思想上产生松懈情绪，我们就学习毛主席的教导：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”并且结合学习召开了讲用会。从那以后，我们就把这条语录作为经常学、反复学的内容。每次战备交接班，首先交接这一条语录，使毛主席的这一指示，在每个同志的脑子里扎根，时刻想到一个“打”字，从各方面做好消灭美国空中强盗的准备。
    为了从根本上加强战备观念，我们还以两条路线斗争为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，组织全体同志开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大控诉。大家认清了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切罪恶，归根结底是要在中国复辟资本主义，使劳动人民受二遍苦。有的同志说：帝、修、反从外部围攻我们，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从内部进攻我们，目的都是一样，就是妄想使中国改变颜色。为了使帝国主义和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的阴谋彻底破产，我们一定要以搞好战备打好仗的实际行动，保卫毛主席，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    不管是黑夜白天，风里雨里，我们都百倍警惕地坚守在战斗岗位上。尽管有时一天数次警报，我们抱定“宁跑万次空，不漏一次情”的决心，战斗意志从不松懈，始终把心扎在战斗岗位上，把身子钉在战斗岗位上。有的同志描绘这种战斗生活时说：“整天不离战斗岗位，时刻抓紧毛主席著作的学习，敌机来了狠揍敌机，敌机不来狠批《修养》。”
    四月二十四日的战斗，大家怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对帝国主义和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的无比仇恨，一举将入侵的两架敌机击落。在胜利面前，有的同志产生了麻痹思想，认为敌人害怕了，不敢再来了。我们立即重新学习毛主席的教导：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”同志们认识到：美国强盗的侵略本性至死不会改变，它只要不灭亡，就会捣乱。我们一定要从思想上、行动上随时做好“打”的准备。
    由于我们树立了连续作战、常备不懈的思想，五月一日的战斗，尽管情况复杂，战机短暂，我们仍然取得了辉煌的胜利。
