The Albanian "Warrior Daily" published an editorial on July 30 titled "Paying Revolutionary Combat Salute to the Glorious Brotherly Chinese Army" to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The editorial states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new type of proletarian army created, nurtured, tempered, and led by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. It has bravely fought against heavily armed enemies—Japanese militarists, American imperialists, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and other reactionaries—and defeated them on the battlefield. Over the past 18 years of liberation, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has continuously strengthened and grown, becoming a powerful weapon of proletarian dictatorship, vigilantly defending the People's Republic of China. Under the education of proletarian internationalism, it has contributed its blood to defend the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to achieve victory over American imperialists and their lackeys.

The editorial points out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made and is making outstanding contributions in opposing bourgeois and revisionist thought, in opposing anti-party and anti-socialist elements, and in promoting the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The editorial emphasizes that the foundation of all victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army lies in the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, in the close ties between the military and the people, in the fraternal unity among soldiers and between officers and soldiers, and in its proletarian revolutionary stance.

The editorial concludes by saying that there is a close brotherly friendship between the peoples and armies of Albania and China. This friendship was created by the Party of Labour of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is continually developing and strengthening.

    阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》向中国人民解放军致以革命的战斗敬礼
    解放军在文化大革命中作出伟大贡献
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》七月三十日发表题为《向光荣的兄弟中国军队致以革命的战斗敬礼》的社论，热烈祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十周年。
    社论说，中国人民解放军是中国共产党和毛泽东同志缔造、培育、锻炼和领导的一支新型的无产阶级的军队。它同武装到牙齿的敌人——日本军国主义者、美帝国主义者、蒋介石卖国贼和其它反动派进行了英勇的斗争，并且在战场上打败了他们。解放十八年来，中国人民解放军在毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义思想武装下，不断加强和壮大，成为无产阶级专政的强大武器，警惕地保卫着中华人民共和国，并在无产阶级国际主义精神的教育下，以自己的鲜血为保卫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、为取得对美帝国主义者及其仆从的胜利，作出了贡献。
    社论指出，中国人民解放军在反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，在反对反党、反社会主义分子，在推进无产阶级文化大革命的发展方面，已经做出并且正在做出杰出的贡献。
    社论强调指出，中国人民解放军一切胜利的基础在于中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，在于军民之间的紧密联系，在于战士之间和官兵之间兄弟般的团结，在于它的无产阶级革命立场。
    社论最后说，阿中两国人民和两国军队之间有着紧密的兄弟友谊。这一友谊是以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的。它正在日益发展和加强。
