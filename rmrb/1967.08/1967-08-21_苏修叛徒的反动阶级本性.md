Recently, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been frenziedly anti-China, reaching a level of extreme viciousness.

It has mobilized all its propaganda machinery, with big and small leaders bare-chested, frantically attacking our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, directly aiming at our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

It has openly colluded with American imperialism, spreading anti-China rumors to each other, exchanging anti-China materials, and instigating a gang of revisionist lackeys and reactionaries from countries around China to stir up a new anti-China tide internationally.

It has continuously provoked the Chinese people, creating anti-China incidents. When its ship personnel provoked in a Chinese port and were counterattacked by the local people, it used this as an excuse to create anti-China hysteria, distorting facts, reversing black and white, and stirring up anti-China sentiment within the Soviet Union.

The Soviet revisionist clique's frenzied anti-China actions reflect the fact that their days are getting worse. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, especially the current revolutionary criticism and repudiation, has touched their sore spots. In the Middle East incident and the great betrayal at Khartoum, their faces of betraying the revolutionary interests of the peoples of various countries have been fully exposed. The dissatisfaction of the Soviet people is growing day by day, and the infighting within the ruling clique is becoming more apparent. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and a small group of traitors, in order to resist the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, to cover up their betrayal of the revolutionary interests of the peoples of various countries, to create public opinion for their collusion with American imperialism, and to divert the attention of the domestic people, once again resort to the already bankrupt "trick" of anti-China.

While frenziedly anti-China, the Soviet revisionist clique is also getting along very well with American imperialism. Currently, their collusion in various aspects is accelerating.

On the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," the Soviet Union and the United States are close to finalizing a deal. Johnson publicly stated that progress has been made in signing the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons," and he is "optimistic."

The mutual visits of Soviet and American leaders and so-called "civilian" exchanges are also filled with a "friendly" atmosphere. Recently, the late American imperialist leader Kennedy's advisor Sorensen visited the Soviet Union and praised the Soviet revisionist clique's "warmth in remembering President Kennedy." The Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Poliansky, while visiting Canada, had a "warm" conversation with the American big capitalist Eaton. Even the American circus performing in the Soviet Union was praised by the Soviet revisionist clique in a nauseating way, calling it "brothers and artistic colleagues."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." The Soviet revisionist clique's hatred towards the Chinese people and its warmth towards American imperialism are completely out of its class instinct. The Soviet revisionist clique, representing the Soviet bourgeois privileged class, has usurped the power of a socialist country and re-ridden on the heads of the Soviet people. Although its history is not as long as that of the American imperialist monopoly bourgeoisie, it possesses the same reactionary class nature. It is no wonder that this group of traitors regards the Wall Street bosses as their "family," while viewing the international proletariat and the revolutionary people of the world as their enemies.

The so-called "Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world" line pursued by the Soviet revisionist clique is originally serving the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism. Especially after the Glassboro talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionist's foreign policy line has further fallen into the track of the American imperialist global strategy. American imperialism wants to realize its global aggression, and it will increasingly rely on the role of the Soviet revisionist traitors, while regarding China as its number one enemy. The Soviet revisionist clique wants to push its revisionist line, and it will increasingly shamelessly rely on American imperialism, betray the people of the world, and regard China as a thorn in its side. The more the two families collude, the more they will frenziedly attack China, which has become a rule.

However, the "honeymoon" between American imperialism and Soviet revisionism and their alliance of counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" will end up being a pipedream. In the face of the revolutionary torrent of the people of the world, these two biggest reactionaries in the world will not be able to save each other, but will only meet their doom together!

    苏修叛徒的反动阶级本性
    本报评论员
    最近时期，苏修叛徒集团疯狂反华，已经达到了穷凶极恶的地步。
    它开动全部宣传机器，大小头目们赤膊上阵，拚命攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命，把矛头直接指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。
    它同美帝国主义公开合流，互相传播反华谣言，互相转载反华材料，并且策动一伙修正主义娄罗和中国周围一些国家的反动派，在国际上掀起一个新的反华逆流。
    它不断地向中国人民挑衅，制造反华事端。当它的一条货船的人员在中国港口挑衅，遭到当地人民的反击之后，它又借此大做反华文章，歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，在苏联国内制造反华歇斯底里。
    苏修集团这样疯狂反华，正是反映了它们的日子越来越不好过。中国无产阶级文化大革命，特别是目前的革命大批判，触痛了他们的疮疤。在中东事件中，在霍利布什的大叛卖中，他们出卖各国人民革命利益的嘴脸暴露无遗。苏联人民的不满与日俱增，统治集团内部的倾轧也越来越表面化。勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一小撮叛徒，为了抵制中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，掩盖对各国人民革命利益的背叛，给勾结美帝制造舆论，转移国内人民的视线，又一次乞灵于反华这个早已破产的“法宝”。
    苏修集团一面疯狂反华，一面同美帝国主义打得火热。目前，它们两家在各方面的勾结正在加速进行。
    在“防止核扩散”问题上，苏美已经接近拍板成交。约翰逊公开表示，在签订“防止核扩散条约”方面“取得了进展”，令人“乐观”。
    苏美头面人物的互相访问和所谓“民间”来往，也充满着“亲善”的气氛。最近，死去的美帝头子肯尼迪的顾问索伦森到苏联活动，对苏修集团“怀念肯尼迪总统的热情”大为赞赏。访问加拿大的苏联部长会议第一副主席波利扬斯基，同美国大资本家伊顿进行了“热烈的”谈话。甚至在苏联演出的美国马戏团，也受到苏修集团的肉麻吹捧，称之为“兄弟和艺术同事”。
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”苏修集团对中国人民这样仇视，对美帝国主义这样亲热，完全是出于它的阶级本能。苏修集团所代表的苏联资产阶级特权阶层，是篡夺了社会主义国家的政权，重新骑在苏联人民的头上的反动的资产阶级。虽然它的资历比不上美帝国主义的垄断资产阶级，但是却具有共同的反动阶级本性。苏修这一伙叛徒，把华尔街老板看作是自己的“一家人”，而把国际无产阶级和世界革命人民视为自己的仇敌，这又有什么奇怪呢？
    苏修集团推行的所谓“苏美合作主宰世界”的总路线，本来就是为美帝国主义的反革命全球战略效劳的。特别是美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈之后，苏修的对外政策总路线已经进一步纳入美帝的全球战略的轨道。美帝国主义要实现它在全世界的侵略野心，必然越来越看重苏修叛徒的作用，而把中国作为它的头号敌人。苏修集团要推行它的修正主义路线，必然越来越无耻地投靠美帝，叛卖世界人民，而把中国视为眼中钉。美苏两家越是加紧勾结，就越要疯狂反华，这已经成为一种规律。
    但是，美帝苏修的“蜜月共处”和纠合反革命“神圣同盟”的蠢动，到头来不过是一场黄粱梦。在世界人民革命的洪流面前，这两家世界最大的反动派，是谁也救不了谁的，而只能共同地遭灭顶之灾！
