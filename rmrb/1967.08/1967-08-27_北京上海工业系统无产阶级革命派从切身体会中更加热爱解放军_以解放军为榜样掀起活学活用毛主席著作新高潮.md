"The PLA is our model for learning!" This is the heartfelt experience of the revolutionary masses in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises. They follow Chairman Mao's great instructions, hold high the banner of supporting the army, believe in the PLA, rely on the PLA, and with the most sincere attitude learn from the PLA. They place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the foremost, most important, highest, and greatest position, striving for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the joint struggle with the PLA's leftist support personnel, the revolutionary masses in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises have seen with their own eyes that the PLA holds the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, studies and applies Chairman Mao's works best, implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line most resolutely, and supports the revolutionary masses most powerfully. They love the PLA from the bottom of their hearts, thank the PLA, and support the PLA. Broad masses of workers say: We must humbly and sincerely learn from the PLA, and treat the battlefield of revolutionary struggle as a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Waterworks Company have learned from the PLA's experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Before holding criticism meetings, they select relevant chapters and quotations from Chairman Mao's works as weapons to criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique and their agents in their unit. They study them seriously, raising the level of revolutionary criticism to a new height. Recently, during the criticism of "Self-Cultivation," they learned from the PLA's experience of诉苦 (suing grievances) before battle, actively carrying out activities of comparing the past and present and recalling bitterness and sweetness, deepening their limitless love for Chairman Mao and strengthening their hatred for Chinese Khrushchev. With strong class feelings, they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, holding dozens of large, medium, and small criticism meetings in succession. They also use big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, cartoons, and literary performances to concentrate firepower, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters led by Chinese Khrushchev from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects.

Many factories' revolutionary masses have personally experienced that the PLA is indeed a strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship. When the revolutionary masses were suppressed and persecuted, they stood up and fully supported the revolutionary masses, seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; after the revolutionary masses seized power, they helped the revolutionary masses, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, hold power well and use power well.

The PLA, personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Wherever they go, they bring the glorious traditions of the PLA. The PLA supporting the 27th Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Changxindian often goes deep into the workshops and workers' dormitories, helping revolutionary workers study Chairman Mao's works, chatting with workers, and seizing every opportunity to participate in productive labor. Their model actions have a great educational impact on the revolutionary masses.

Many workers in industrial and mining enterprises, when talking about the PLA, cite numerous vivid examples, enthusiastically praising the PLA for studying the "Three Articles" best and helping revolutionary workers study the "Three Articles" most enthusiastically. The PLA supporting the Beijing Wire Factory, in promoting revolutionary unity, helped leftist organizations and masses study the "Three Articles," breaking private interests and establishing public interests, overcoming small-groupism, factionalism, individualism, and anarchism; helped the deceived masses study the "Three Articles," overcoming private thoughts, recognizing the correct direction, and resolutely breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; helped erroneous cadres study the "Three Articles," discarding private interests, removing the fear, and resolutely standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, humbly accepting criticism from the masses, and resolutely fighting alongside the revolutionary masses, tempering and testing themselves in the great waves of mass struggle. After achieving revolutionary unity, the PLA further grasped the study of the "Three Articles" in the face of various forms of "private interests" exposed in the new situation, consolidating revolutionary unity, promoting revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and better carrying out revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary masses expressed: The PLA helps us study the "Three Articles," building a "Great Wall" against revisionism and anti-revisionism in our minds. We must learn from the PLA better, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the foremost, most important, highest, and greatest position, learning and applying new levels in the struggle, and running the factory as a great school of Mao Zedong Thought like the PLA.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: The revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses on Shanghai's industrial and commercial front, taking the PLA as a model, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, powerfully promoting revolutionary criticism and the thought revolutionization of people.

The PLA is our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong's personally created and led great army, directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, a highly proletarianized and combative revolutionary army that holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. At every critical moment in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the PLA's three armies stationed in Shanghai have always stood up, most resolutely standing on the side of the revolutionary masses, closely connected with the revolutionary masses, loving what the revolutionary masses love and hating what the revolutionary masses hate. They also realize that to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to ensure that our proletarian iron fortress never changes color, we must seriously study, actively support, firmly rely on, and infinitely love the great PLA.

Currently, in the new high tide of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle launched by the broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai, the broad officers and soldiers of the three armies stationed in Shanghai, together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses on the industrial and commercial front, hold high the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, pursuing and attacking Chinese Khrushchev, this "falling dog," and fiercely criticizing the great ambitions and great warlords Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

Many PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, with a firm proletarian stance and clear class feelings, concentrate their hatred on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The PLA's deep hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their limitless love for the revolutionary masses have greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses on the industrial and commercial front. Many revolutionary masses excitedly said: The broad officers and soldiers of the PLA not only use the gun to defend our socialist motherland but also use the pen to fiercely denounce the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen attempting to restore capitalism. Having such a PLA that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and can both write and fight is the pride of our revolutionary masses and the pride of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We love our children from the heart!

We rely on the PLA to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; we must also hold and use power well, taking the PLA as a model, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings. This is another experience gained by the revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses on Shanghai's industrial and commercial front in the struggle.

In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the PLA's three armies stationed in Shanghai have always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and on the side of the revolutionary masses, guiding the revolutionary masses to correctly treat themselves, correctly treat cadres, and correctly treat the deceived masses, promoting revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism.

The PLA's three armies stationed in Shanghai, in supporting the left and supporting work, act as both a combat team and a work team, a propaganda team, and a labor team. While vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, they carry forward the "Three-Eight Style," actively participate in labor, and fight alongside the broad masses of workers on the production frontline. Regardless of day or night, wind or rain, wherever there is difficulty, there is the PLA.

The PLA is good in a thousand ways, a million ways, but studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the best. They enthusiastically help the revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses in factories and enterprises to raise the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level. In the study, the PLA practices what they preach, together with the revolutionary masses, exposing their thoughts, fighting private interests, sharing experiences, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews. The revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Flour Mill have deeply felt: The PLA's support in a thousand ways, ten thousand ways, the greatest support is to bring us the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Under the help of the PLA, a new high tide of taking the PLA as a model and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging on Shanghai's industrial and commercial front.

    北京上海工业系统无产阶级革命派从切身体会中更加热爱解放军
    以解放军为榜样掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮
    据新华社二十六日讯　“解放军是我们学习的好榜样！”这是首都工矿企业无产阶级革命派的深切体会。他们遵循着毛主席的伟大指示，高举拥军的旗帜，相信解放军，依靠解放军，以最热诚的态度学习解放军，把活学活用毛主席著作放在先于一切，重于一切，高于一切，大于一切的地位，在无产阶级文化大革命中争取新的胜利。
    在和人民解放军支左人员共同战斗中，首都工矿企业的无产阶级革命派，亲眼看到解放军毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，活学活用毛主席著作最好，执行毛主席的革命路线最坚决，支持无产阶级革命派最有力。他们从心眼里热爱解放军，感谢解放军，拥护解放军。广大革命职工说：我们一定要虚心诚恳地向解放军学习，把革命斗争的战场，作为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。北京自来水公司的革命职工，学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，在开批判会前，针对中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团及其在本单位的代理人的反革命罪行，选择毛主席著作中的有关章节和语录作为武器，认真学习，把革命的大批判提高到新的水平。不久前，在批判《修养》过程中，他们又学习解放军战前诉苦的经验，积极开展今昔对比、忆苦思甜的活动，更加深了对毛主席的无限热爱、增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。他们怀着强烈的阶级感情，以毛泽东思想作武器，连续举行了几十次大中小型批判会，并且用大字报、黑板报、墙报、漫画、文艺说唱等形式，集中火力，从政治上、思想上、理论上，向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部猛烈开火。
    许多工厂的无产阶级革命派都亲身体会到，人民解放军不愧为无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。当无产阶级革命派遭受压制、迫害的时候，他们挺身而出，全力支持无产阶级革命派，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了大权；当无产阶级革命派掌权以后，他们又帮助无产阶级革命派，按照毛主席的教导，掌好权，用好权。
    毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们走到那里，就把解放军的光荣传统带到那里。在长辛店二七机车车辆工厂支左的解放军，经常深入车间和工人宿舍，帮助革命职工学习毛主席著作，和工人谈心，抓紧一切时间参加生产劳动。他们的模范行动对无产阶级革命派教育很大。
    许多工矿企业的革命职工，一谈到解放军，就举出大量生动的事例，热情赞扬解放军学“老三篇”学得最好，帮助革命职工学习“老三篇”最热情。到北京钢丝厂支左的人民解放军，在促进革命大联合中，帮助左派组织群众学习“老三篇”，破私立公，克服小团体主义、山头主义、个人主义和无政府主义；帮助受蒙蔽的群众学习“老三篇”，克服私心杂念，认清大方向，坚决与资产阶级反动路线决裂，回到毛主席的革命路线上来；帮助犯错误的干部学习“老三篇”，丢掉私心，去掉“怕”字，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，虚心接受群众的批评，坚决和革命派战斗在一起，在群众斗争的大风大浪中锻炼和考验自己。在实现革命大联合以后，解放军又针对在新的情况下暴露出来的形形色色的“私”字，进一步狠抓“老三篇”的学习，巩固革命的大联合，促进革命的“三结合”，更好地开展革命的大批判。无产阶级革命派的战士纷纷表示：解放军帮助我们学习“老三篇”，在思想上筑起一道防修反修的“万里长城”，我们一定要更好地学习解放军，把活学活用毛主席著作放在先于一切，重于一切，高于一切，大于一切的地位，在斗争中学出新的水平，用出新的水平，把工厂办成象解放军那样的毛泽东思想大学校。
    据新华社上海二十六日电　上海工交战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，以中国人民解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，有力地推动了革命的大批判和人的思想革命化。
    人民解放军是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的，是林彪副主席直接指挥的伟大军队，是一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的革命军队。在无产阶级文化大革命斗争的每一关键时刻，人民解放军驻沪三军总是挺身而出，最坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和无产阶级革命派血肉相连，爱革命派之所爱，恨革命派之所恨。他们还认识到，要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，要使我们无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色，就必须认真学习、积极拥护、紧紧依靠、无限热爱伟大的人民解放军。
    当前，在上海广大革命群众掀起的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮中，驻沪三军广大指战员和工交战线的革命派和革命群众一起，高举毛泽东思想千钧棒，穷追猛打中国赫鲁晓夫这个“落水狗”，狠狠批判大野心家、大军阀彭德怀、罗瑞卿。
    许多人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，以坚定的无产阶级立场和爱憎分明的阶级感情，把仇恨集中在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上。人民解放军对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的无比仇恨和对革命派无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，大大激发了工交战线上无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的革命斗志。许多革命群众激动地说，人民解放军广大指战员，不仅用枪杆子保卫了我们社会主义祖国，还用笔杆子，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。有这样无限忠于毛主席的能文能武的军队，是我们无产阶级革命派的骄傲，也是中国人民和世界革命人民的骄傲。我们从心里热爱自己的子弟兵！
    我们依靠人民解放军，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权；我们要掌好权、用好权，也必须以解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席的教导办事。这是上海工交战线革命派和革命群众在斗争中得出的又一条经验。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，人民解放军驻沪三军始终站在毛主席的革命路线一边，站在无产阶级革命派一边，以毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己的教导，引导无产阶级革命派正确对待自己，正确对待干部和正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，在革命的大批判中，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    人民解放军驻沪三军在支左支工中，做到既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是宣传队、劳动队。他们在大力宣传毛泽东思想的时候，发扬“三八作风”，积极地参加劳动，与广大工人战斗在生产第一线。不管白天黑夜，不管刮风下雨，那里有困难，那里就有解放军。
    人民解放军千好、万好，归根结蒂活学活用毛主席著作是第一好。他们热情地帮助工厂企业的无产阶级革命派和革命群众把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新的水平。在学习中，人民解放军身体力行，同革命群众在一起，亮思想，斗私心，谈体会，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观。上海面粉厂的无产阶级革命派深有体会地说：解放军千支援，万支援，给我们送来活学活用毛主席著作的经验是最大的支援。
    上海工交战线无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在人民解放军的帮助下，一个以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮正在蓬勃兴起。
