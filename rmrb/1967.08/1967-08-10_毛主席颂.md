    Ode to Chairman Mao
    By Vietnam's Xiang Dong Liu

    The golden sun rises over Beijing,
    Its rays illuminate my heart.
    The red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people,
    With you, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries have nowhere to hide.

    The leader of the world's people is Chairman Mao,
    Human happiness cannot be separated from you.
    The invincible Mao Zedong Thought,
    Nurtures us to create a bright red new world.

    I wish you, the great teacher,
    Eternal life! Eternal life!

    毛主席颂
    越南　向东流
    北京城升起金色的太阳，
    光芒万丈照亮了我的心。
    革命人民心中的红太阳呀，
    有了您，帝、修、反无处躲藏。
    世界人民的领袖是毛主席，
    人类的幸福呀，离不开您。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想呀，
    哺育我们创造个红彤彤的新世界。
    祝愿您，伟大的导师，
    万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
