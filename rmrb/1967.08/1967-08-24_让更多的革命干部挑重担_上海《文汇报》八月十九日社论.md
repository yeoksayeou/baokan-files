The article published on August 17 by our newspaper, reprinted from the editorial board of the *Weidong* magazine of Nankai University in Tianjin, titled "Dare to Use Revolutionary Cadres," is a very important article. It raises an important issue in the current work of schools and a major issue of universal significance after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power. We must study this article carefully.

Some people feel that raising this issue at the moment is sudden. "Isn't the current task to carry out a thorough criticism?" These comrades have set up a contradiction between thorough criticism and solving the cadre issue. We should not view the problem in this way. To carry out thorough criticism and to combine it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, we must mobilize a large number of revolutionary cadres to participate. Without a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre group, without fully utilizing the role of revolutionary cadres, thorough criticism cannot be carried out, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit cannot be carried out. Conversely, only by thoroughly carrying out criticism and concentrating firepower to strike a handful of enemies can we further liberate a large number of people. Therefore, carrying out thorough criticism and liberating a large number of cadres are not contradictory but unified.

The question of whether to dare to use revolutionary cadres is a major issue concerning whether we can consolidate power and whether we can firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The editorial board of *Weidong* magazine says: "If there are no revolutionary cadres, the Red Guards who seized power today may lose it tomorrow." How profound these words are! Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is a party leading a great revolutionary struggle in a nation of tens of millions of people. Without a large number of cadres who are both talented and virtuous, it cannot complete its historical task." Over the past seventeen years since liberation, a significant change is that we have a large number of good cadres who are loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Most of our cadres are good or relatively good. Only by firmly believing in this basic assessment can we actively liberate a large number of cadres, use them boldly, and let them play a core and backbone role in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs.

Some of our comrades have the wrong approach to viewing cadres, which is one-sided. They always feel that these cadres are not good in this way or that way; in their work, they often criticize them for "still following the capitalist reactionary line" and "still on the old track," making them cautious and unwilling to work boldly. When we look at cadres, we should first see the strengths of revolutionary cadres: they are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, have richer fighting experience, and have the ability to wield power and manage business. We should fully utilize these strengths, respect them, unite with them, and boldly let them take on responsibilities, rather than letting them participate in the "three-in-one combination" in name but still be set aside in reality. Of course, this does not mean that all cadres should be reinstated. They will inevitably have some shortcomings and mistakes in their work, but we should help them enthusiastically. If we find "old tracks," then we should work with them to remove the "old tracks" and jointly build new tracks.

To help cadres who have made mistakes in their line return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must push the cadres to the forefront of the struggle. Only in struggle can we identify and test cadres. If we do not let the cadres go to the forefront of the struggle and still keep them in the house for "reflection," then the cadres will not be truly tempered and tested, and we will not be able to truly identify the cadres. Places that still use the method of "reflection" need to pay special attention to this problem.

There is also an important passage in the article "Dare to Use Revolutionary Cadres": "Just as with everything in the world, cadres are also twofold. Twofoldness is a universal law of development. Daring to use revolutionary cadres does not mean that cadres will not change in the future. We anticipate this, so we can be prepared. With the development of the revolution, we will eliminate a few corrupt elements and continuously select those who are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, loyal to the dictatorship of the proletariat, closely connected with the masses, and constantly advancing to the leading positions." This passage tells us that we must use a developmental perspective to view cadres and a twofold perspective to view cadres. Someone asks, if the cadres who have already joined the "three-in-one combination" leading cadre group turn bad in the future, what should we do? In the entire period of socialist revolution, in the sharp and complex class struggle, it is not surprising that some people turn bad. There will always be a few who fall behind and turn bad. If they turn bad, then we will continue to eliminate them; but after going through severe tests in great storms, there will definitely be more revolutionary cadres who become better. If they become better, then we should let them take on heavier responsibilities and make greater contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

For revolutionary cadres, the people's requirements are higher in the new revolutionary situation. They should stand taller, boldly take on work, and not be hindered by the word "difficult" or the word "fear." Thoughts and words like "it's difficult to take on work," "it's difficult to handle relationships," "fear of taking responsibility," "fear of taking a stand," and "fear of making mistakes" are all unacceptable. Complaining moods also hinder one's progress. These are not the demeanor and style of a proletarian revolutionary. We should cast aside all selfish thoughts, face difficulties head-on, and take on heavy responsibilities, never disappointing Chairman Mao's earnest expectations of us.

    让更多的革命干部挑重担
    ——上海《文汇报》八月十九日社论
    本报八月十七日转载的天津南开大学《卫东》编辑部评论员文章《要大胆使用革命干部》，是一篇很重要的文章。它提出了当前学校工作中的一个重要问题，提出了在无产阶级革命派掌权后一个具有普遍意义的重大问题。我们要好好学习这篇文章。
    有人对当前提出这个问题感到突然。“当前不是要搞大批判吗？”这些同志把大批判与解决干部问题对立起来了。我们不能这样看问题。要搞好大批判，并把大批判与本单位的斗批改结合起来，必须放手发动广大革命干部参加。没有一个革命的“三结合”的领导班子，没有充分发挥革命干部的作用，革命的大批判是搞不好的，本单位的斗批改也是搞不好的。反之，也只有深入开展了大批判，集中火力打击一小撮，才能进一步解放一大批。因此，开展大批判与解放一大批干部，不是对立的，而是统一的。
    要不要大胆使用革命干部，这是关系到能不能巩固政权的大问题，也是要不要坚决贯彻毛主席革命路线的大问题。《卫东》编辑部评论员的文章说：“如果没有革命的干部，红卫兵小将今天夺了权，明天就有可能丧失政权。”这话说得何等深刻啊！毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的。”解放十七年多来，有一个很大的变化是：我们有了一大批忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部。我们的大多数干部是好的和比较好的。坚定地相信这个基本估计，才会积极地去解放一大批，放手使用他们，让他们在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中起核心作用和骨干作用。
    我们有些同志看待干部的思想方法不对，有片面性。他们看干部，总是觉得这些干部这也不是，那也不行；在工作中，动辄指责他们“还是资产阶级反动路线”，“还是老轨道”，弄得他们缩手缩脚，不敢大胆工作。我们看干部，首先要看到革命干部的长处：政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，斗争经验比较丰富，有掌好权和管理业务的能力。我们要充分发挥他们的这些长处，尊重他们，团结他们，放手让他们挑担子，而不要让他们名义上参加“三结合”，实际上还是扔在一边。当然，这决不意味着所有的干部都官复原职。他们在工作中的确也不免会出现这样或那样的缺点和错误，但要热情地帮助他们。如果发现了“老轨道”，那就和他们一道来拆除“老轨道”，共同来建立新轨道。
    要帮助犯过路线错误的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，一定要把干部推到斗争第一线去。只有在斗争中才能识别和考验干部。如果不让干部到斗争第一线去，仍是关在屋子里“闭门思过”，这样，干部就不能得到真正的锻炼和考验，我们也就不能真正识别干部。还在采用“闭门思过”方法的地方，需要特别注意这个问题。
    《要大胆使用革命干部》一文中还有一段话很重要：“正同世界上一切事物一样，干部也是一分为二的。一分为二，这是事物发展的普遍规律。大胆使用革命干部，并不是说干部将来就不会有变化。我们预见到这一点，就可以心中有数。随着革命的发展，淘汰个别腐化分子，不断将那些忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的、忠于无产阶级专政的、密切联系群众的、不断前进的优秀干部，选拔到领导岗位上来。”这段话告诉我们，一定要用发展的观点去看待干部，用一分为二的观点去看待干部。有人问，如果已经参加“三结合”领导班子的干部，将来变坏了，怎么办？在整个社会主义革命时期，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，有人变坏了，那是不奇怪的。总会有少数人掉队，变坏。变坏了，那就继续淘汰；但经过大风大浪的严峻的考验，却一定会有更多的革命干部变得更好。变好了，那就要让他们挑更重的担子，为无产阶级革命事业作出更大的贡献。
    对革命干部说来，在新的革命形势面前，人民对他们的要求更高了。他们应当更好地挺起腰杆，大胆抓工作，而不应该“难”字挡道，“怕”字当头。什么“抓工作难”、“处理关系难”、“怕负责任”、“怕摆观点”、“怕再犯错误”之类的想法和说法，统统都是要不得的。埋怨情绪，更妨碍自己前进。这些都不是无产阶级革命家的气度和风格。我们要抛掉种种私心杂念，见困难就上，见重担就挑，决不辜负毛主席对我们的殷切期望。
