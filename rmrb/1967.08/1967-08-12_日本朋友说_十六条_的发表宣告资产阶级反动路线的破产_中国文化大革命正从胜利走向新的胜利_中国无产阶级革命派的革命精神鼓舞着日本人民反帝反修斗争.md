Japanese friends say the publication of the "Sixteen Points" declares the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing from victory to victory. The revolutionary spirit of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries is inspiring the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tokyo, the deputy director of the Hyogo Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kunishi Kazuo, spoke to a Chinese reporter on the occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He said that under the personal direction of Chairman Mao, this epoch-making document was formulated at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It declared the complete bankruptcy of the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line.

This document is a great encouragement to all the people of the world by the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, adding courage and confidence to the struggle of all the people of the world.

Kunishi, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, said that the "Sixteen Points" is the guiding principle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to advance from victory to victory, and is a document of great world-historical significance.

Kunishi said that over the past year, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people, with the revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dog," have defended and implemented the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, defeated the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieved great victories in the Cultural Revolution. This revolution has smashed the plot by the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, ensuring that China will never change color, and further consolidating China, the stronghold of the world revolution.

Kunishi pointed out that more than fifty days before the publication of the "Sixteen Points," the bourgeois reactionary line was rampant, and the Chinese Khrushchev suppressed and instigated white terror against the proletarian revolutionaries, attempting to suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this time, the propaganda machines of the Japanese bourgeoisie and revisionists all slandered and maligned the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, engaging in anti-China activities in an attempt to eliminate the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. At this time, the Miyamoto revisionist clique, in tune with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Soviet modern revisionists, maliciously slandered and attacked Chairman Mao, and maliciously defamed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, completely exposing their counter-revolutionary faces. The Miyamoto revisionist clique also stirred up an anti-China witch-hunt within the party, confusing right and wrong, and engaging in a despicable and shameful act of great betrayal.

Kunishi said that at this time, Japanese Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people saw the "Sixteen Points," saw the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries high up the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the great fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to pull the emperor off his horse," advanced bravely, greatly inspiring our struggle.

Kunishi said that in the struggle for the liberation of the Japanese people, in order to strengthen the fighting friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China, we are determined to fight to the end against the anti-China, counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Miyamoto clique.

Kunishi pointed out that we deeply feel the greatness and correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought from the "Sixteen Points." Kunishi said that we will firmly grasp the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to make sacrifices, fearing no hardship, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and with unshakable will fight against the Miyamoto revisionist clique. Kunishi emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the guiding principle for all actions, and the strongest and sharpest weapon for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese revolutionary people and the people of the world. He said that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought can the Japanese revolutionary people be guaranteed to achieve revolutionary victory.

    日本朋友说“十六条”的发表宣告资产阶级反动路线的破产
    中国文化大革命正从胜利走向新的胜利
    中国无产阶级革命派的革命精神鼓舞着日本人民反帝反修斗争
    据新华社东京电　日中友好协会兵库县正统总部副事务局长郡司和男，在《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表一周年的时候，向中国记者发表谈话说，在毛主席亲自主持下，在中国共产党八届十一中全会上制定的这个划时代的文件，宣告了中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产。
    这个文件是伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想对全世界人民的无限鼓舞，给全世界人民增添了斗争勇气和信心。
    郡司满怀革命激情地说，十六条是中国无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利的指南，是具有伟大世界历史意义的文献。
    郡司说，一年来，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下的七亿中国人民，以“痛打落水狗”的革命气概，捍卫和执行了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，打垮了资产阶级反动路线，使文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。这场革命粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋，确实保证了中国永不变色，进一步巩固了世界革命的坚强堡垒中国。
    郡司指出，在十六条发表前的五十多天里，资产阶级反动路线猖獗一时，中国的赫鲁晓夫对无产阶级革命派实行镇压和白色恐怖，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命压下去。正在这个时候，日本的资产阶级和修正主义的宣传机器，一齐对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行造谣中伤，大肆反华，妄图消除中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。这时，宫本修正主义集团同美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义唱一个调子，丧心病狂地大肆诬蔑和攻击毛主席，恶意诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命，完全暴露了它们的反革命面目。宫本修正主义集团还在党内掀起反华妖风，混淆黑白，颠倒是非，进行了卑鄙可耻的大叛卖勾当。
    郡司说，正在这个时候，日本的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，看到了十六条，看到了中国无产阶级革命派高高举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的革命精神，奋勇前进，极大地激励了我们的斗争。
    郡司说，在争取日本人民的解放斗争中，为了加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊和团结，我们誓同宫本集团的反华反革命的修正主义路线斗争到底。
    郡司指出，我们从十六条中，深切地感到伟大的领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大和正确。郡司说，我们将紧紧掌握十六条这个武器，遵循毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，以不可动摇的意志同宫本修正主义集团进行斗争。郡司强调说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是一切行动的指导方针，是日本革命人民和世界革命人民进行革命斗争的最强大、最锐利的武器。他说，只有活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，才是日本革命人民取得革命胜利的最可靠的根本保证。
