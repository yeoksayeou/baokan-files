The great thought of Mao Zedong commanded the complete annihilation of invading American planes in a victorious battle

A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force held a grand victory celebration on the evening of August 28 in a certain place in the south to celebrate the great victory of completely annihilating two invading American planes and capturing one American spy on August 21. The celebration honored the units and individuals who performed exceptionally in the battle. The attending soldiers and officers enthusiastically hailed this victory as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the result of resolutely carrying out Comrade Lin Biao's directive to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They vowed to further uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "seize the revolution and promote preparedness for war," and achieve greater victories in defending the nation and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The venue was adorned with red flags and filled with the joyous atmosphere of victory. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" echoed endlessly. In the center of the stage hung a colorful portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. Opposite the stage, the large characters of Comrade Lin Biao's personal inscription "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" shone brightly.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East is Red." The soldiers and officers, filled with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted, "Long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! May he live ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They also read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "The entire command and fighting personnel of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting will. Any thought of relaxing the fighting will or of underestimating the enemy is wrong."

Attending the victory celebration were Wang Huichiu, a responsible person of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, responsible persons of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force, and over a thousand soldiers, officers, militiamen, and representatives of revolutionary masses from the units.

At the meeting, Comrade Wang Huichiu read the commendation order from the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and presented certificates of merit, red "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Poems of Chairman Mao," and shining Mao badges to the units and individuals who performed exceptionally in the battle.

Comrade Wang Huichiu spoke at the meeting. He said, this victory is the result of the participating units responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote preparedness for war" and Comrade Lin Biao's battle call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." It is the result of the participating soldiers and officers' efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out education on the two lines, actively participate in and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

Wang Huichiu strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. He said, Chairman Mao taught us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles." Recently, American imperialism, in close coordination with the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique, has been frantically expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, pursuing the plot of "bombing to force surrender." At the same time, it is striving to strengthen its aggressive deployments in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia, and is trying to form a new counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" against China, against communism, and against the people, in an attempt to block the great historical tide of revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. However, American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are all paper tigers. We solemnly warn American imperialism: Your any war provocation will not shake our firm resolve to aid Vietnam and resist America. Armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are invincible in the world. If you dare to impose war on us, we will smash your backbone!

Wang Huichiu encouraged the soldiers and officers of the units that performed exceptionally in the battle to uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary leftists, support, help, and protect the revolutionary leftists at all times, think what the revolutionary leftists think, worry about what the revolutionary leftists worry about, help what the revolutionary leftists need, learn from the revolutionary leftists, and regard the revolutionary leftists as teachers. Unite with the revolutionary leftists, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. Follow the strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionaries. Launch a fierce attack on the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his representatives in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois command department. At the same time, we must be vigilant, strengthen preparedness for war, closely watch the movements of the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary forces, and be ready at any time to smash the enemy's sudden attacks. We will make new contributions to defending the motherland, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the world revolution.

Militiaman Lu Guanlin and representatives of the revolutionary masses who actively cooperated with the PLA soldiers in capturing the American spy spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," believe in the PLA, rely on the PLA, learn from the heroic PLA, and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. They will elevate the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, seize the revolution, promote production, and preparedness for war, further implement the three guarantees in militia work, and truly achieve the goals of being ready to fight at any time, being able to fight when called, and being able to win when fighting. If American imperialism dares to invade, we will immediately take action, cooperate with the PLA in combat, and thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate all enemies, safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the socialist iron mountain of the motherland.

In the midst of warm applause, the representative of the soldiers and officers who performed exceptionally in the battle, Kang Zhensheng, spoke. He said excitedly, the victory of this battle is entirely due to the great leader Chairman Mao, due to Comrade Lin Biao, due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, due to the great assistance of brother units, and due to the great support of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary leftists. We must always remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind." We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great battle call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We must unswervingly emphasize proletarian politics, elevate the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level and new height. We must actively participate in the great criticism, firmly safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieve new victories in safeguarding Chairman Mao, safeguarding Mao Zedong Thought, and safeguarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must be highly vigilant, stand ready for battle, and be prepared to launch a devastating blow against the invading enemy at any time. We will use our battle victories to support the proletarian revolutionaries.

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." (Accompanied by a photograph)

    伟大的毛泽东思想指挥了全歼入侵美机的胜利战斗
    我空军某部举行庆功祝捷大会
    广大指战员决心进一步大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，更好地贯彻毛主席抓革命促战备的伟大指示，为保卫国防和保卫无产阶级文化大革命，立更大的新功。
    新华社二十九日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部二十八日晚上在南方某地隆重举行庆功祝捷大会，庆祝八月二十一日一举全歼入侵美机两架，并活捉美国飞贼一名的重大胜利，表扬作战有功单位和人员。到会的指战员们热烈欢呼这一胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是坚决执行林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的指示的结果。指战员们决心进一步大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，更好地贯彻执行毛主席抓革命促战备的伟大指示，为保卫国防和保卫无产阶级文化大革命，立更大的新功。
    会场上，红旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，充满了胜利的欢乐气氛，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声震耳不绝。主席台的中央悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的彩色画像。主席台的对面，林副主席的亲笔题词“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的大字闪闪发光。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始，指战员们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深情，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”并齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”
    参加庆功祝捷大会的有，中国人民解放军空军负责人王辉球，广州部队负责人、广州部队空军负责人和部队指战员、民兵、革命群众代表等一千多人。
    会上，王辉球同志宣读了中共中央军委的嘉奖令，并将立功奖状、红彤彤的《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》、《毛主席诗词》和金光闪闪的毛主席像章，发给作战有功单位和人员。
    王辉球同志在大会上讲话。他说，这次胜利，是参战部队以实际行动响应毛主席抓革命、促战备，“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的伟大号召，和林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召所取得的重大成绩，是参战部队指战员努力活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展两条路线的教育；积极参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命，破私立公，大抓人的思想革命化，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威的结果。
    王辉球强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行。他说，毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”最近，美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团的紧密配合下，疯狂扩大侵略越南战争，推行“以炸迫降”的阴谋，同时竭力加强在亚洲，特别是在东南亚的侵略部署，拼凑反华反共反人民的新的反革命“神圣同盟”，妄图阻挡各国人民革命斗争的伟大历史洪流。但是，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，统统都是纸老虎。我们严正警告美帝国主义：你们的任何战争挑衅，都丝毫动摇不了中国人民援越抗美的坚强决心。用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军是天下无敌的。如果你们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就坚决砸碎你们的脊骨！
    王辉球勉励作战有功部队指战员要大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席革命路线的绝对权威。坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚定地站在革命左派一边，时时支持、帮助和保护革命左派，想革命左派所想，急革命左派所急，帮革命左派所需，向革命左派学习，拜革命左派为师，和革命左派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。紧跟伟大舵手毛主席的战略部署，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流猛烈开火，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。同时要提高警惕，加强战备，密切注视帝修反的一举一动，随时准备粉碎敌人的突然袭击，为保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为世界革命作出新的贡献。
    积极配合人民解放军战士活捉美国飞贼的民兵陆关林和革命群众代表在大会上讲话，他们表示，要坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，相信解放军，依靠解放军，向英雄的人民解放军学习，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作提高到新的阶段，抓革命、促生产，促战备，进一步搞好民兵工作三落实，真正做到召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜。美帝国主义胆敢来犯，我们就立即出动，配合人民解放军作战，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭一切敌人，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫祖国的社会主义铁打江山。
    在热烈的掌声中作战有功人员代表康振生讲话，他激动地说，这次战斗的胜利，完全归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于林副主席，归功于党中央、中央军委和中央文革小组的正确领导，归功于兄弟单位的大力协助，以及广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的大力支援。我们一定牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，坚决响应林副主席的伟大战斗号召“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作提高到新阶段、新水平。积极参加革命的大批判，坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线立新功，百倍警惕，严阵以待，再接再厉，随时准备给来犯的敌人以毁灭性的打击，用战斗的胜利支援无产阶级革命派。
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。（附图片）
