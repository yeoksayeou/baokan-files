Shanghai Third Steel Plant, which has fully exceeded the national plan for the first half of this year, has, since achieving revolutionary great unity on July 1st, further implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary masses and cadres of the entire factory have achieved even greater victories in production.

In July, the steel and steel product output of this factory exceeded the national plan by 3.25% and 4.55% respectively. Since August, the revolutionary and production situation of this factory has been getting better and better.

During the great storm of the "January Revolution," the revolutionary masses of Shanghai Third Steel Plant, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seized back the leadership power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Subsequently, the ten revolutionary mass organizations in the factory, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively. They united smoothly in the common struggle of exposing and criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

After the revolutionary masses of Shanggang Third Factory united, the factory-level revolutionary big criticism combined combat corps and the first-line command department for grasping revolution and promoting production, which were formed with the revolutionary masses as the core, unified the leadership of the revolutionary masses of the entire factory. They grasped the revolution firmly and promoted production vigorously. The revolutionary masses kept in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on the correct direction of struggle, united all forces that could be united, and always directed the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They closely combined the big criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to concentrate their firepower in criticizing the heinous crimes of the capitalist restoration by the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad revolutionary masses broke through the shackles of the revisionist rules and regulations for running enterprises, and their revolutionary spirit became more ardent. The entire factory was in a fervent production atmosphere.

Since July, Shanghai has been experiencing continuous scorching heat. The revolutionary workers in the open-hearth furnace shop, despite the high temperatures, racked their brains and devised ways to ensure product quality while increasing output. The average smelting time per furnace was reduced from over five hours to over four hours, and the average daily output was increased from five furnaces to a stable high level of six furnaces. The responsible persons and masses of the revolutionary mass organizations in the second converter shop fought on the high-temperature frontline, insisted on the mass line in their work, consulted with the masses on matters, and also mobilized the enthusiasm of the shop's cadres. In July, they overcame difficulties in raw materials and still exceeded the national plan.

    上钢三厂抓革命促生产很出色
    超额完成今年头七个月生产计划
    据新华社上海电　全面超额完成今年上半年国家计划的上海第三钢铁厂，在七月一日胜利实现全厂的革命大联合以后，广大革命职工和革命干部更加坚决地贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在生产上夺得了更大的胜利。
    七月份，这个厂的钢和钢材产量分别超额百分之三点二五和百分之四点五五完成了国家计划。八月份以来，这个厂的革命和生产形势越来越好。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，上海第三钢铁厂的无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺回了被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的领导大权。接着，厂里十个革命群众组织，在中国人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大揭发、大批判的共同斗争中顺利地联合起来。
    上钢三厂无产阶级革命派联合起来以后，以无产阶级革命派为核心组成的厂级革命大批判联合战斗组和抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，统一领导全厂革命群众，狠抓革命，猛促生产。无产阶级革命派牢记毛主席的教导，坚持斗争大方向，团结一切可以团结的力量，一直把斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并且把革命的大批判同本厂斗批改结合得更加紧密。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，集中火力狠批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。广大革命职工冲破束缚群众的修正主义办企业的条条框框，革命精神更加昂扬，全厂生产热火朝天。
    七月份以来，上海连日酷热。平炉车间革命工人冒着高温，千方百计动脑筋、想办法，在保证产品质量的前提下提高产量，全车间平均每炉钢的冶炼时间由原来的五个多小时缩短到四个多小时，平均日产量从原来的五炉提高到六炉的稳定的高水平上。第二转炉车间革命群众组织的负责人和群众一起战斗在高温第一线，工作中坚持走群众路线，遇事同群众商量，并且注意调动了车间干部的积极性。七月份，他们克服了原材料方面的困难，依然超额完成了国家计划。
