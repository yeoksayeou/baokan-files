To take the socialist road or the capitalist road? This has been the focal point of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev. Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out to the people of the entire nation that we must steadfastly take the socialist road. He said, "The founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, marked the basic conclusion of the stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of the socialist revolution. The general line and general task of the Party in this transitional period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce."

However, China's Khrushchev openly contradicts Chairman Mao, claiming that "in China, taking relatively serious socialist steps is a matter for the fairly distant future"; he wildly advocates for the development of urban and rural capitalism, calling for a struggle "to consolidate the new democratic system"; he even shouts, "To develop capitalist exploitation, the more exploitation, the greater the merit," and so on. In short, he wants to bring capitalism to China. China's Khrushchev not only says this but also does it. Over the past seventeen years of liberation, wherever he could, he stubbornly pushed a reactionary line of bourgeois dictatorship. Our factory is one of the factories most affected by this reactionary line.

Before the public-private partnership, due to the support of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao, the capitalists in our factory exploited workers even more brazenly. To make money, they paid no heed to the workers' lives, took no safety measures, and as a result, an accident occurred in the printing and dyeing workshop, and a class brother was crushed to death by a machine. After the accident, the broad masses of workers unanimously demanded the punishment of the capitalist. However, China's Khrushchev's agents in Qingdao not only withdrew the original sentence of imprisonment for the capitalist but also, the next day, under the name of "united front," elevated this bloodsucker to the position of "Vice Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Political Consultative Conference," and soon after, he was given the title of "Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Political Consultative Conference." Look, this is what China's Khrushchev means by "the more exploitation, the greater the merit"! Isn't it clear whom China's Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao are close to and whom they hate, whose morale they boost and whose morale they crush?

In 1953, our factory became a public-private partnership, but the agents and cronies of the capitalists were still placed in various important departments of the factory by China's Khrushchev's agents in our factory. The son of the capitalist took control of the entire factory's funds, and the feudal foremen and supervisors who used to ride roughshod over the workers transformed themselves into important positions such as section chiefs and directors. The handful of agents of China's Khrushchev in our factory were not satisfied with this; they even cloaked a private agent who had loyally served the capitalists in the garb of a "red capitalist," brought him into the union, and shoved him into the provincial political consultative conference, thereby gaining legal status in politics and further expanding the power of the bourgeoisie. The capitalists became more demanding, and China's Khrushchev and his agents in our factory retreated step by step. The private agent said, "The workers don't listen, they don't obey," and they immediately shamelessly said in the party committee meeting and cadre meeting, "We must respect him, we must obey his leadership"; the private agent said, "My power is too small," and they quickly handed over administrative power and key production departments to the capitalists to lead. This servile attitude made us so angry that our lungs almost burst.

From the above facts, we can clearly see that what China's Khrushchev said about "struggling to consolidate the new democratic system" is nothing but a struggle to develop capitalism, a struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and a struggle to implement bourgeois dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious." China's Khrushchev tries every means to attempt to pull the wheel of history backward, but the result is that he lifted the stone and dropped it on his own foot. The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has exposed China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places. Their dream of restoring capitalism in China has been shattered. The ant's arm blocks the car, self-destruction, this is the fate of China's Khrushchev. We will follow the socialist road pointed out by Chairman Mao, break through the waves, and advance to victory!

    螳臂挡车  自取灭亡
    青岛国棉九厂革命委员会  李春霆
    走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路？这是几十年来以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点。我们伟大领袖毛主席给全国人民指出，要坚定不移地走社会主义道路。他说，一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国的成立，标志了新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命阶段的开始。“党在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却公然和毛主席唱反调，胡说什么“在中国采取相当严重的社会主义的步骤，还是相当长久的将来的事情”；他猖狂地为发展城乡资本主义而奔走呼号，要“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”；他甚至叫嚷：“要发展资本主义剥削，这种剥削是进步的”，“剥削的越多功劳越大”等等。一句话，他要在中国搞资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫不仅这样说，而且这样做。解放十七年来，在他力所能及的地方，都顽固推行了一条资产阶级专政的反动路线。我厂就是受这条反动路线影响较大的工厂之一。
    公私合营前，由于中国赫鲁晓夫和他在青岛代理人的撑腰，我厂资本家对工人的剥削更加肆无忌惮。他为了赚钱，不顾工人死活，不采取安全措施，结果造成印染车间的事故，一个阶级兄弟被机器轧死。事故发生后，广大工人一致要求惩办资本家。但是中国赫鲁晓夫在青岛的代理人不仅撤销了原来对资本家的徒刑，而且第二天就以“统战”为名，把这个吸血鬼捧上青岛市“政协副主席”的宝座，不久又挂上了“山东省政协副主席”的头衔。看，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“剥削的越多功劳越大”！中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青岛的代理人对谁亲，对谁恨，长谁的志气，灭谁的威风，不是很清楚了吗？
    一九五三年我厂公私合营了，然而资本家的代理人及其亲信们仍然被中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的代理人安插到厂里各个重要部门。资本家的儿子掌管了全厂的资金，过去骑在工人头上的封建把头、监工，也摇身一变担任了科长、主任等重要职务。中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的一小撮代理人还嫌不够，他们竟把一个为资本家忠实效劳的私方代理人披上“红色资本家”的外衣，拉进工会，塞进省政协，在政治上取得了合法地位，进一步扩大了资产阶级的权力。资本家得寸进尺，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人步步退让。私方代理人说：“工人不听话，不听管”，他们就立刻厚颜无耻地在党委会、干部会上讲：“要尊重他，要服从他的领导”；私方代理人说：“我的权小了”，他们就赶紧把行政大权和生产的要害部门交给资本家领导。这副奴才相，简直把我们的肺气炸了。
    通过以上事实，我们就清楚地看到，中国赫鲁晓夫所说的要“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”不是别的，就是要为发展资本主义而斗争，就是要资产阶级向工人阶级进行“斗争”，就是要实行资产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”中国赫鲁晓夫千方百计地妄图把历史的车轮拉向后转，但结果是搬起石头打了自己的脚。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人揪出来了。他们企图在中国复辟资本主义的美梦破产了。螳臂挡车，自取灭亡，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的下场。而我们则将沿着毛主席所指引的社会主义道路，乘风破浪，胜利前进！
