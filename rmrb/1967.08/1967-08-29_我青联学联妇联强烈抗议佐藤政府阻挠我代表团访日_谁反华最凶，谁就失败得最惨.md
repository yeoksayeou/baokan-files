The All-China Youth Federation, All-China Students' Federation, and All-China Women's Federation have recently issued separate statements strongly protesting the Sato government's obstruction of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation's visit to Japan.

The statements from the All-China Youth Federation and All-China Students' Federation point out that recently, under the immense pressure from the Japanese people and the condemnation from the Chinese people, the Sato government played a trick of fake approval and actual rejection. It refused to allow four members of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation, including youth and student representatives, to enter the country. It also imposed various unreasonable restrictions on the delegation's activities in Japan. This is another serious crime committed by the Sato government in its further attempt to curry favor with the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and to push forward its anti-China policy and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship. This is a serious provocation against the Chinese people, and Chinese youth and students express great indignation and strong protest!

The statements say that Chairman Mao pointed out long ago when meeting with Japanese friends that "birds of a feather flock together." The obstruction and sabotage of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation's visit to Japan is a result of the collusion between the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique led by Miyamoto and the Sato government. This fully exposes the fact that the Miyamoto revisionist clique and the Japanese reactionaries are birds of a feather; it exposes the traitorous face of the Miyamoto clique, which is anti-China, anti-revolution, anti-people, and sells out to the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries.

The statements point out that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists, and the Miyamoto clique are all paper tigers. We solemnly tell these paper tigers that your frenzied anti-China actions and sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendship will only result in you lifting a rock to drop it on your own feet. You will not have a good ending.

The All-China Women's Federation's protest statement says that the billion revolutionary women of China strongly protest the Sato reactionary government's setting up of numerous obstacles and unreasonable rejection of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation's entry into Japan.

The statement points out that the Sato reactionary government's deliberate sabotage of exchanges of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples is a new crime that fully exposes its face of currying favor with the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and actively serving as an anti-China vanguard. It is extremely afraid of the great influence of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extremely afraid of the great thought of Mao Zedong, and even more afraid of the Japanese people mastering Mao Zedong Thought, rebelling against them, and overthrowing them. Thus, it has become so frantically anti-China. We solemnly warn the Sato government: Such a plot to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will never succeed. The more fiercely you are anti-China, the more miserably you will fail.

    我青联学联妇联强烈抗议佐藤政府阻挠我代表团访日
    谁反华最凶，谁就失败得最惨
    新华社讯　全国青联、全国学联和全国妇联最近分别发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府阻挠中日友协代表团访问日本。
    全国青联、全国学联的声明指出，最近，佐藤政府在日本人民的强大压力和中国人民的谴责下，耍了个假批准实拒绝的花招，竟然拒绝中日友协代表团的包括青年和学生代表在内的四名成员入境，并对我代表团在日活动提出种种无理限制条件。这是佐藤政府进一步讨好美帝、苏修，讨好蒋帮，疯狂推行反华政策、破坏中日友好的又一新的严重罪行，这是对中国人民的严重挑衅，中国青年和学生对此表示极大愤慨和强烈抗议！
    声明说，毛主席在接见日本朋友时，早就指出“物以类聚，人以群分。”阻挠和破坏中日友协代表团访日，是日共宫本修正主义集团与日本佐藤政府狼狈为奸，相互勾结干出来的。这就充分暴露了宫本修正主义集团和美日反动派是一丘之貉；暴露了宫本集团反华、反革命、反人民、卖身投靠美日反动派的叛徒面目。
    声明指出，美日反动派、苏修和宫本集团统统都是纸老虎，老实告诉你们这些纸老虎，你们疯狂反华，破坏中日友好，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，绝不会有好下场的。
    全国妇联的抗议声明说，亿万中国革命妇女对日本佐藤反动政府悍然设下许多障碍无理拒绝中日友好协会访日代表团入境，提出最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，佐藤反动政府蓄意破坏中日人民友好往来这一新罪行，完全暴露了它讨好美帝、苏修、蒋帮，积极充当反华马前卒的嘴脸。它和帝国主义、现代修正主义以及其他各国反动派一样，极端害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，极端害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，更害怕日本人民掌握了毛泽东思想，造他们的反，革他们的命。于是狗急跳墙，竟然如此猖狂反华。我们严正警告佐藤政府：这种妄图破坏中日两国人民友谊的阴谋，是永远不能得逞的。谁反华最凶，谁就失败得最惨。
