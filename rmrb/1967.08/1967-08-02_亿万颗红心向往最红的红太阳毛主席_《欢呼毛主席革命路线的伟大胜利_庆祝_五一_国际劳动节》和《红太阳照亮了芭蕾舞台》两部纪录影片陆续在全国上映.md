Millions of red hearts yearn for the reddest sun, Chairman Mao. The documentary films "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line—Celebrating May Day International Labor Day" and "The Red Sun Illuminates the Ballet Stage" will soon be screened nationwide.

New China News Agency, August 1: In the new high tide of the great criticism where the revolutionary people of a billion rise up with a thousand-pound hammer to beat the "falling dogs," and on the glorious anniversary of the 40th birthday of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, revolutionary masses across the country will have the opportunity to see the glorious image of our great leader Chairman Mao on the screen again. Starting from August 1, the two newly completed documentary films, the color documentary "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line—Celebrating May Day International Labor Day" and the documentary "The Red Sun Illuminates the Ballet Stage," will be screened successively in various parts of the country. These two films are triumphant songs composed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

This year's May Day International Labor Day came at a time when the revolutionary struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries was surging and developing vigorously around the world. It came at a time when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had achieved great victories that shocked the world. It came at a time when our people were launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line—Celebrating May Day International Labor Day" is a film that records our great leader Chairman Mao and revolutionary people from China and abroad celebrating this great victory together. The film begins with the words of Vice Chairman Lin for May Day International Labor Day: "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!" One scene after another on the screen makes people strongly feel that Vice Chairman Lin's words for May Day reflect the common voice of all revolutionary people in China and the world. During the screening, audiences can hear this voice appearing in the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in their oath-taking ceremony full of confidence to win greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in their joint celebration with revolutionary people around the world of the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Even many foreign children who are not yet very clear in speaking Chinese sing out "The Boat Sails on Because of the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao"!

Just at this moving moment when millions of red hearts yearn even more for the red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, together with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others, rode in an open car to the revolutionary masses celebrating May Day International Labor Day. "Chairman Mao has come!" "Chairman Mao has come!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The cheers echoed through the sky, and the resounding songs of "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "The Boat Sails on Because of the Helmsman" shook the heavens and the earth. In this most happy moment, how many people were so excited that they jumped and shouted with joy, and how many people were so excited that they sang passionately with tears of joy! Red quotations, red armbands, and red flags formed a vast red sea! Countless happy faces turned towards the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. Look, Chairman Mao is radiant and full of vigor. He is so healthy and full of energy, constantly waving his powerful arms towards the revolutionary masses, smiling and greeting them, congratulating them on the festival. What is particularly moving is that on the night of the magnificent May Day celebration, when Chairman Mao came to the people again, revolutionary masses and international friends repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" At this moment, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao shouted again, "Long live the comrades!" This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest trust, greatest encouragement, and greatest support for the revolutionary people of the whole of China and the whole world!

The documentary "The Red Sun Illuminates the Ballet Stage" records the moving scene of our great leader Chairman Mao watching the ballet "White-Haired Girl." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Ballet School and other cultural workers successfully created and performed the large-scale revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl." This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. At the moment when the whole country is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, watched "White-Haired Girl," making the ballet stage exceptionally bright. The audience can see that at this happy moment, the revolutionary cultural workers are so happy and honored. They enthusiastically cheer, jump with joy, and their revolutionary hearts are more firmly and unshakably loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and to always carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art!

The color documentary "Hail the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line—Celebrating May Day International Labor Day" and the documentary "The Red Sun Illuminates the Ballet Stage" were produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio.

    《欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节》和《红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台》两部纪录影片陆续在全国上映
    新华社三十一日讯　在亿万革命人民奋起千钧棒痛打“落水狗”的大批判的新高潮中，在伟大的中国人民解放军诞生四十周年的光辉节日里，广大革命群众将有机会从银幕上再一次看到我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。从八月一日起，全国各地将陆续上映刚刚摄制完成的彩色纪录片《欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节》和纪录影片《红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台》。这两部影片，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想谱成的动人凯歌。
    今年的“五一”国际劳动节，是在全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义及各国反动派的革命斗争风起云涌、蓬勃发展的时代潮流中到来的，是在我国的无产阶级文化大革命取得了震惊世界的伟大胜利的日子里到来的，是在我国人民向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动总攻击的战斗中到来的。《欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节》，就是纪录我们伟大领袖毛主席和中外革命人民在一起，欢庆这一伟大胜利的影片。影片一开始便映出了林副主席为“五一”国际劳动节的题词：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”银幕上的一个又一个镜头，使人们强烈地感到，林副主席为“五一”节的题词，反映了全中国、全世界革命人民的共同心声。在放映过程中，观众们可以听到这个声音出现在无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的斗争里，出现在他们满怀信心地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利的誓师中，也出现在他们和全世界革命人民同声欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的辉煌胜利的时候，就连说中国话还不太清楚的许多外国小朋友，也高唱出《大海航行靠舵手》和《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》！
    就是在这个亿万颗红心更加向往红太阳的动人时刻，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席同他的亲密战友林彪同志以及周恩来同志等，乘坐敞篷汽车来到欢庆“五一”国际劳动节的革命群众中间。“毛主席来了！”“毛主席来了！”“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”的欢呼声响彻天空，《万岁！毛主席》、《大海航行靠舵手》的嘹亮歌声震天动地。在这最最幸福的时刻，多少人激动得欢呼跳跃、欣喜若狂，多少人兴奋得纵情歌唱、热泪盈眶！红色的语录，红色的袖章，红色的旗帜，汇成一片红色的海洋！千万张幸福的笑脸，向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。看，毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，他老人家身体这样健康，精力这样充沛，不断地挥动着他那雄劲有力的手臂，向革命群众微笑招手，祝贺节日。特别令人激动的是，在那焰花瑰丽的“五一”狂欢之夜，当毛主席又一次来到群众当中，广大革命群众和国际友人频频高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席又一次高呼：“同志们万岁！”这是毛主席对全中国、全世界革命人民的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大支持！
    影片《红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台》，纪录了我们伟大领袖毛主席观看芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的动人情景。上海市芭蕾舞学校的革命师生和其他文艺工作者，在毛主席的革命文艺路线指引下，成功地创造并演出了大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在举国欢庆毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席观看《白毛女》，这使芭蕾舞台显得分外明亮。观众可以看到，在这幸福的时刻，革命的文艺工作者是多么幸福和光荣。他们热烈欢呼，纵情跳跃，无比忠于伟大领袖毛主席和永远执行毛主席的革命文艺路线的革命红心更加坚定不移！
