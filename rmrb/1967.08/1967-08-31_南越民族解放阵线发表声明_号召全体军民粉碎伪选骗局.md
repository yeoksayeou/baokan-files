The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on August 28, denouncing the so-called "elections" planned by the U.S.-puppet regime for September 3 as illegal and worthless.

The statement pointed out that the "elections" staged by the U.S.-puppet regime are merely a political deception aimed at giving a veneer of legality and democracy to the puppet government of South Vietnam, creating an illusion of stability to deceive public opinion. It is also intended to temporarily ease internal contradictions within the puppet regime.

The statement emphasized that as long as U.S. imperialism continues its aggression in South Vietnam and the puppet government exists, there can only be fascist dictatorship, not democracy, and only oppression and suppression, not freedom. The statement called on all military and civilian personnel in South Vietnam to resolutely expose and smash the enemy's election fraud, intensify political struggle, armed struggle, and the work of disintegrating the enemy's forces, to hasten the enemy's collapse.

The Youth Liberation Union and the Student Liberation Union of South Vietnam, representing the three million youths and students of South Vietnam, also recently issued a statement strongly opposing the "election" farce staged by the U.S.-puppet regime. They declared that the youths and students of South Vietnam will resolutely boycott this fraud orchestrated by U.S. imperialism.

The people of the liberated areas of South Vietnam are enthusiastically sending their sons to join the liberation army.

    南越民族解放阵线发表声明
    号召全体军民粉碎伪选骗局
    新华社河内三十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发言人二十八日发表声明指出，美伪集团将于九月三日举行的所谓“选举”是非法的和毫无价值的。
    声明指出，美伪集团搞的这次“选举”丑剧，只不过是一种政治欺骗手段，目的是要为美国走狗——南越伪政权涂上一层合法和民主的脂粉，造成一种稳定的假象来欺骗舆论。同时也是为了暂时缓和傀儡集团内部的矛盾。
    声明说，越南南方全体人民都深深地懂得，只要美帝国主义还在进行侵略越南南方的战争，只要美国走狗伪政权还存在一天，那么，只能有法西斯独裁，而不可能有民主，只能有迫害和镇压，而不可能有自由。声明号召全体南方军民坚决揭露和粉碎敌人的“选举”骗局，加强政治斗争、武装斗争和瓦解敌军的工作，使敌人加速土崩瓦解。
    越南南方青年解放联合会和越南南方学生解放联合会，代表越南南方三百万青年和学生最近也发表声明，强烈反对美伪集团的“选举”丑剧，表示越南南方青年和学生将坚决抵制美帝国主义导演的这一骗局。（附图片）
