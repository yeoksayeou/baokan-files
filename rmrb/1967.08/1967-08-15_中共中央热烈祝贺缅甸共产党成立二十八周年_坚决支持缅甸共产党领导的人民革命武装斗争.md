Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Burma! Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulates the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Burma and firmly supports the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Communist Party of Burma.

We firmly believe that the Communist Party of Burma, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, will adhere to the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power," further unite the entire party and all nationalities of Burma, overthrow the Nay Win reactionary government, and achieve a thorough victory in the Burmese revolution. Let us, in the struggle to jointly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party, further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Burma.

New China News Agency, August 14th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today sent a telegram to Chairman Thakin Than Tun of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma, warmly congratulating the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Burma. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Thakin Than Tun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma:

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people warmly congratulate the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Burma.

Under the leadership of Comrade Thakin Than Tun, the Communist Party of Burma has high-held the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle, and led the Burmese people in a long and heroic struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

The Communist Party of Burma has gone through various trials and tribulations, withstood the pressure from the Soviet revisionist leadership and the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party, overcome the "left" and right opportunism within the party, and adhered to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, becoming the core force leading the revolutionary cause of all nationalities in Burma.

The Communist Party of Burma has implemented the policy of self-reliance, persisted in nearly twenty years of armed struggle, accumulated and developed revolutionary forces, and dealt heavy blows to the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackeys in Burma. The armed struggle of the Burmese people has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Burmese reactionaries.

The Nay Win reactionary government is having a harder time under the iron fist of the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Burma. The Nay Win clique, in order to save itself from annihilation, is shamelessly implementing a counter-revolutionary policy of dictatorship, betrayal, anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people. The desperate struggles of the Nay Win clique can only lead to its more miserable failure.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people firmly support the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Communist Party of Burma. We regard this support as our duty of proletarian internationalism.

The Communist Party of China sincerely thanks the Communist Party of Burma for its enthusiastic praise of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and for its support and adherence to the proletarian revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong.

In the long-term revolutionary struggle, the two parties and the peoples of China and Burma have forged a deep friendship. Let us, in the struggle to jointly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party, further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Burma.

We firmly believe that the Communist Party of Burma, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, will adhere to the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power," further unite the entire party and all nationalities of Burma, overthrow the Nay Win reactionary government, and achieve a thorough victory in the Burmese revolution.

Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Burma!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

    我们坚信以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命路线，一定能够进一步团结全党和缅甸各族人民，打倒奈温反动政府，赢得缅甸革命战争的彻底胜利。让我们在共同清算中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义路线的斗争中，进一步巩固和发展中缅两党、两国人民的战斗友谊。
    新华社十四日讯　中国共产党中央委员会今天打电报给缅甸共产党中央委员会主席德钦丹东同志，热烈祝贺缅甸共产党成立二十八周年。贺电全文如下：缅甸共产党中央委员会主席德钦丹东同志：
    中国共产党和中国人民，热烈祝贺缅甸共产党成立二十八周年。
    以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路，领导缅甸人民同帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义进行了长期的英勇的斗争。
    缅甸共产党经历了各种风险和考验，顶住了苏联修正主义领导集团和中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的压力，克服了党内的“左”右倾机会主义，坚持了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，成为领导缅甸各族人民革命事业的核心力量。
    缅甸共产党实行自力更生的方针，坚持了近二十年的武装斗争，积聚和发展了革命力量，沉重地打击了帝国主义及其走狗在缅甸的反动统治。缅甸人民的武装斗争，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和缅甸反动派的威风。
    奈温反动政府，在缅甸共产党领导的人民武装铁拳的打击下，日子越来越不好过。奈温集团为了挽救它被灭亡的命运，赤裸裸地推行独裁、卖国、反共、反华、反人民的反革命政策。奈温集团的疯狂挣扎，只能使它自己失败得更惨。
    中国共产党和中国人民，坚决支持缅甸共产党领导的人民革命武装斗争。我们把这种支持看作是我们应尽的无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    中国共产党衷心感谢缅甸共产党对中国无产阶级文化大革命的热烈赞扬，衷心感谢你们对毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线的拥护和支持。
    中缅两党、两国人民在长期的革命斗争中，结下了深厚的友谊。让我们在共同清算中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义路线的斗争中，进一步巩固和发展中缅两党、两国人民的战斗友谊。
    我们坚信，以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命路线，一定能够进一步团结全党和缅甸各族人民，打倒奈温反动政府，赢得缅甸革命战争的彻底胜利。
    中缅两党、两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
                    中国共产党中央委员会
