Chinese experts in Myanmar, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to serving the Myanmar people, and have been warmly welcomed by the Myanmar working people. The Ne Win reactionary government, which harbors extreme hatred for the friendship between the Chinese and Myanmar peoples, has restricted, detained, and even massacred our experts in Myanmar, fully exposing the reactionary nature of this traitorous, dictatorial military clique.

Since 1962, hundreds of outstanding Chinese engineering and technical personnel have gone to Myanmar. They have overcome the challenges of a hot climate, language barriers, harsh working and living conditions, and the weakness of Myanmar's technical forces. Together with the Myanmar workers, they have worked diligently and enthusiastically to help the Myanmar people.

In their work, Chinese experts always take the lead in the dirtiest, hardest, and most dangerous tasks. For example, during the construction of the reservoir for the Sada Paper Mill, they braved the 42-degree heat to lead the pouring of asphalt. At critical moments in the construction process, Chinese experts, following Chairman Mao's teachings, displayed a spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, and relentless fighting. During the construction of the Taik Bridge, to ensure that the piers were built above water during the dry season, they worked day and night in three shifts, enduring hardships and fatigue. Some comrades went without rest for several nights, successfully completing the task of hastily building the piers.

Chinese experts regard Myanmar workers as their class brothers and do their best to pass on all their technical knowledge to the Myanmar workers. At the Sada Paper Mill, there was an old steelworker who had worked with British "experts" for many years. Because the British monopolized technology, he not only couldn't read blueprints but also didn't know the basic techniques of tying steel bars. However, during the construction of the mill, thanks to the sincere help of the Chinese experts, he quickly learned the basic theories and operating techniques of steelwork. He praised the Chinese experts as his true teachers, saying they had taught him real skills. The Chinese experts also humbly learned the hardworking and studious qualities of the Myanmar workers. They learned from each other in their joint labor and forged deep friendships.

Imperialists and Soviet revisionists, under the guise of "aid," had once lorded it over the Myanmar people. The Myanmar working people saw through their actions and hated them deeply. The selfless internationalist spirit of the Chinese experts, in the style of Dr. Norman Bethune, gave them class education time and again. An old carpenter at the paper mill said, "I've seen many foreign experts. British experts can't do without binoculars, Soviet experts can't do without offices, and Japanese experts beat or curse the workers. Only the experts educated by Chairman Mao treat us as brothers." These words expressed the sentiments of all the Myanmar people.

The Ne Win reactionary government, under the banner of "socialism," oppresses the workers. Myanmar workers do not receive even basic labor protection; they are injured or fall ill without treatment and are greatly discriminated against. The Chinese experts, full of sympathy and love for their class brothers in Myanmar who are suffering in deep waters and fires, put into practice Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessness and dedication to the people" and caring for the people's hardships. In a lifting accident, Comrade Xi Wenpin, to save a Myanmar worker brother, was seriously injured himself. During a high-altitude operation, a large bamboo pole suddenly fell from above, heading straight for a Myanmar worker's head. At this dangerous moment, Comrade Fan Benhua stretched out his arm to block the bamboo pole, saving the Myanmar worker's life, but he himself was seriously injured.

In January of this year, a fire broke out in the dormitory of the Mien Sugar Factory, causing chaos. Chinese experts rushed to the scene to put out the fire. After the fire, the Chinese experts donated over 400 pieces of clothing and a sum of money to help the affected class brothers. They also voluntarily worked four extra hours each day to allow the affected workers to return home and arrange their lives. However, the Myanmar officials, fearing the influence of Mao Zedong Thought and indifferent to the workers' lives, confiscated the clothes and money donated by the Chinese experts and dared not publish the letters of condolence written by the Chinese experts to the victims. This incident made the Myanmar workers further realize the reactionary nature of the Ne Win government.

The deeds of Chinese experts wholeheartedly serving the Myanmar people have been praised by the Myanmar people. In a nutshell, "Chinese experts are good, all thanks to Chairman Mao's education!" They see in the excellent qualities of the Chinese experts the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, the superiority of the socialist system, and their bright future. They love Mao Zedong Thought very much. They say, "Where there is Mao Zedong Thought, there is light and hope." Many workers, despite the authorities' surveillance, eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. Many people repeatedly ask the Chinese experts for Chairman Mao's badges.

The Ne Win reactionary regime is terrified of the friendship between the Chinese and Myanmar peoples and has taken many measures to restrict contact between workers and Chinese experts, dispatching spies to guard the Chinese experts' residences day and night. However, the spread of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is something that no reactionary forces can restrict. In March of this year, just before the Ne Win reactionary clique launched a large-scale, frenzied anti-China campaign, 200 university students from Yangon came to the Sada site for internships. Upon arriving at the site, they eagerly asked the Chinese experts for Chairman Mao's works and badges. Students who received Chairman Mao's badges excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is your great leader and the great leader of the world's people." When these students returned to Yangon, the Chinese experts went to the station to see them off, and the entire carriage echoed with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

When the Chinese experts at the Mitthila Textile Mill completed their mission and returned home, Myanmar workers wearing shiny Chairman Mao badges came to the experts' dormitory to see them off. Many people were reluctant to part, tears in their eyes. They said, "We will never forget the good experts sent by Chairman Mao. Although you are leaving, the friendship between the Chinese and Myanmar peoples will be passed down for generations." Then, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, they sang in Chinese, "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao."

    永远不忘毛主席派来的好专家
    ——缅甸人民赞誉全心全意为缅甸人民服务的中国专家
    中国援缅专家，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全心全意为缅甸人民服务，受到了缅甸劳动人民的热烈欢迎。奈温反动政府极端仇恨中缅两国人民之间的友谊，限制、拘禁、甚至屠杀我援缅专家，彻底暴露了这个卖国独裁的军阀政权的反动面目。
    从一九六二年开始，数百名优秀的中国工程技术人员去到缅甸。他们克服了气候炎热，语言不通，工作、生活条件艰苦，缅方技术力量薄弱等重重困难，和缅甸工人一起，辛勤劳动，努力工作，满腔热情地帮助缅甸人民。
    中国专家在工作中，总是带头参加最脏、最苦、最危险的操作。例如，在建设雪当纸厂的储浆池时，他们冒着四十二度的酷热，带头浇沥青。在施工的关键时刻，中国专家总是按照毛主席的教导，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风。在修建太可桥工程时，为了在枯水季节把桥墩修出水面，他们日夜三班，艰苦奋战，有的同志几夜不休息，胜利地完成抢建桥墩的任务。
    中国专家把缅甸工人看成是自己的阶级兄弟，想尽办法把自己的全部技术传授给缅甸工人。雪当纸厂有一位老钢筋工，跟英国“专家”干了好多年，由于英国人垄断技术，使他不但不会识图，连绑扎钢筋的基本技术都不会。但是，在纸厂建设过程中，由于中国专家的真诚帮助，他很快就学会了钢筋工的基本理论知识和操作技术。他称赞中国专家是他真正的师傅，使他学到了真正的本领。中国专家也虚心地学习缅甸工人勤劳好学的优良品质。他们在共同劳动中相互学习，结下了深厚的友谊。
    帝国主义、苏联修正主义的一些“专家”，曾经打着“援助”的招牌，骑在缅甸人民头上作威作福。缅甸劳动人民对他们的种种行径，看在眼里，恨在心里。中国专家白求恩式的国际主义精神，使他们受到了一次又一次生动的阶级教育。纸厂一位老木工说：“我见过不少外国专家。英国专家离不开望远镜，苏联专家离不开办公室，日本专家对工人非打即骂。只有毛主席教育的专家才把我们看成是兄弟。”这位老工人的这番话表达了全体缅甸人民的心意。
    奈温反动政府打着“社会主义”的幌子，干着压榨工人的勾当。缅甸工人得不到起码的劳动保护，工伤、生病得不到治疗，受到极大的歧视。中国专家对于处在水深火热之中的缅甸阶级兄弟，满怀同情和热爱。他们身体力行地贯彻毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”，关心群众疾苦的教导。在一次吊装事故中，专家奚文品同志，为了使缅甸工人兄弟脱险，自己身负重伤。专家范本华同志在一次高空作业时突然从上面掉下来一根大毛竹，直向一位缅甸工人的头部打去，在这危险的时刻，他伸出自己的臂膀挡住了大毛竹，挽救了缅甸工人的生命，但他自己却受了重伤。
    今年一月，米邻糖厂工人宿舍失火，秩序大乱。中国专家奋不顾身地去救火。火灾后，中国专家捐出四百多件衣物和一笔现款，援助受灾的阶级兄弟。他们还自动每天加班四小时，以便让受灾工人能回家安排生活。但是，害怕毛泽东思想影响和不顾工人死活的缅甸官员却把中国专家捐助的衣物和款项扣压了下来，也不敢把中国专家写给受难者的慰问信公布出来。这件事使缅甸工人进一步认清了奈温政府的反动本质。
    中国专家全心全意为缅甸人民服务的事迹受到缅甸人民同声赞誉，千言万语，归结为一句话：“中国专家好，全是毛泽东主席教育的好！”他们从中国专家的优秀品质中，看到了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，看到了社会主义制度的优越性，看到了他们光明的未来。他们非常热爱毛泽东思想。他们说：“那里有毛泽东思想，那里就有了光明和希望。”许多工人不顾当局的监视如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。许多人三番五次地向中国专家索取毛主席像章。
    奈温反动政权对中缅两国人民的友谊害怕得要死，竟然采取许多措施限制工人和中国专家接触，派特务日夜守在中国专家住所的周围。可是，光辉的毛泽东思想的传播是任何反动势力限制不了的。今年三月，正是奈温反动集团大规模地疯狂反华的前夕，仰光二百名大学生到雪当工地实习。他们到达工地就纷纷向中国专家要毛主席著作和像章。得到毛主席像章的学生激动地说：“毛主席是你们的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的伟大领袖。”当这些学生回仰光时，中国专家到车站送行，整个车厢里响起了一片“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”的欢呼声。
    在密铁拉纺织厂的中国专家完成任务回国时，缅甸工人带上金光闪闪的毛主席像章来到专家宿舍送行。许多人都依依不舍，热泪盈眶。他们说：“我们永远忘不了毛主席派来的好专家。你们虽然走了，可是中缅两国人民的友谊将千秋万代地传下去。”接着，大家手挽手、肩并肩，用中国话高唱：《大海航行靠舵手》和《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。
    现在，当奈温集团的反动统治正处在内外交困的时候，竟然狗急跳墙，掀起了反华排华运动，同时，以各种卑鄙的手段，对中国专家进行迫害，企图以此来割断他们同缅甸人民的联系。这是奈温反动集团的痴心妄想！缅甸人民终将在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，彻底推翻奈温集团的反动统治。中缅两国人民之间的友谊只会一天比一天发扬光大。　·新华社记者·
