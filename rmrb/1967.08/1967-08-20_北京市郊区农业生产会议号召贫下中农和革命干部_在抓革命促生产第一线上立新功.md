The Beijing Municipal Suburban Agricultural Production Command Headquarters recently held a suburban agricultural production conference. The conference analyzed the current excellent situation of suburban agricultural production, summarized and exchanged experiences, and made an overall deployment for autumn production work. The conference decided to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to use the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to promote the "three autumns" production high tide, to further mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, to seize the autumn harvest, and to timely plant high-quality wheat.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Lin Biao's inscription for the Beijing Garrison's Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Conference was published: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is the greatest support, encouragement, concern, and exhortation for the people's liberation army soldiers and revolutionary cadres attending the conference who are supporting agriculture. Everyone expressed that they would definitely respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call, achieve greater results in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the suburbs, on the frontline of grasping revolution and promoting production, and in the intense battle to seize the harvest, and achieve new merits for the people.

After discussing the excellent situation, the attendees unanimously expressed: We must not relax our minds because the situation is excellent. Each county, district, and commune must carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous combat. They must seize the last critical moment of the growth of autumn crops, do a good job in the late management of autumn fields, prevent possible pests, diseases, and flood disasters, and strive for increased production of grain, cotton, and rapeseed.

The conference also preliminarily solidified the wheat planting plan for this autumn. It is required that each commune, while focusing on the management of autumn crops, must thoroughly do a good job in the ideological mobilization and material preparation before wheat planting. Fully mobilize the masses, democratically discuss and formulate specific autumn sowing plans, and complete the autumn sowing task on time and with high quality, laying the foundation for agricultural production next year.

The conference emphasized that the great criticism must be regarded as the guiding principle for seizing the harvest and doing a good job in the "three autumns" work. Fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and push the great criticism and struggle to a new high tide. Thoroughly expose the ugly souls of the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison they spread in the suburbs, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Promote the great unity of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, greatly arouse the class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and powerfully promote autumn production work.

    北京市郊区农业生产会议号召贫下中农和革命干部
    在抓革命促生产第一线上立新功
    据新华社十九日讯　北京市抓革命促生产第一线指挥部最近召开的郊区农业生产会议，分析了当前郊区农业生产的大好形势，总结交流了经验，全面部署了秋季生产工作。会议决定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判、大斗争，来推动“三秋”生产高潮，进一步发动贫下中农和革命干部，夺取秋季丰收，适时种好小麦。
    会议期间，发表了林彪副主席为北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的题词：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”这是对参加会议的支农的人民解放军指战员和革命干部的最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大关怀、最大鞭策。大家表示，一定要坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，在郊区的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在抓革命促生产第一线上，在夺取丰收的紧张战斗里，做出更大成绩，为人民立新功。
    到会的同志在畅谈大好形势后，一致表示：决不可以因为形势大好而在思想上有丝毫松懈。各县区社队，要发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，抓紧秋收作物生长的最后关头，搞好秋田后期管理，防止可能发生的病虫、雨涝灾害，力争粮棉油菜全面增产。
    会议还初步落实了今秋的种麦计划。要求各社队在抓紧秋收作物管理的同时，切实做好种麦前的思想动员和物质准备工作，充分发动群众，民主讨论制订出具体的秋播计划，高质量地适时完成秋播任务，为明年的农业增产打下基础。
    会议强调指出，一定要把革命的大批判作为夺取丰收、搞好三秋工作的纲。充分放手发动群众，依靠群众，把革命大批判、大斗争运动推向新的高潮，彻底揭露中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团的丑恶灵魂，彻底肃清他们在郊区散布的修正主义流毒，牢固地树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，大大激发起广大革命群众和革命干部的阶级觉悟和革命热情，有力地推动秋季生产工作。
