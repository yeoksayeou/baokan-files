In the midst of the fierce criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is established.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended congratulations and encouraged everyone to, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, and through criticism and struggle, improve the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units, promoting the rapid development of scientific undertakings.

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: Amidst the triumphant drums of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the high tide of the nation's criticism and struggle against the "fallen dogs," the proletarian revolutionaries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with hearts full of excitement, held a grand meeting in the Great Hall of the People on the afternoon of July 30th to celebrate the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and to commemorate the first anniversary of the Central Cultural Revolution Group's support for the proletarian revolutionaries of the scientific and technological community in the capital, held in the Great Hall of the People on July 30th last year under the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao.

Central leaders and responsible comrades from relevant departments, including Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Nie Rongzhen, Guo Moruo, Xiao Hua, Su Yu, and Wu De, attended the meeting.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, greeted the proletarian revolutionaries of the Academy and congratulated the meeting. He said, after a year of struggle, you have fought your own revolution and liberated yourselves. Through the recent two months of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of power-holders within the unit who are taking the capitalist road, you have achieved the great unity of the revolutionaries. Now, the Revolutionary Committee, which combines representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army, has been established. This is a worthy celebration. Premier Zhou encouraged everyone to, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, and through criticism and struggle, improve the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units, promoting the rapid development of scientific undertakings.

On the 30th, the magnificent Great Hall of the People was filled with joy and a spirit of unity and struggle. A giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hung in the center of the stage, shining like a red sun over the entire hall. At 1:40 PM, the meeting began with the entire hall singing "The East Is Red." Immediately after, everyone recited Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delivered the opening speech. He said, one year ago today, the Central Cultural Revolution Group held a meeting here, inviting tens of thousands of people. Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, and Comrade Jiang Qing gave important speeches at the meeting, bringing the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao to the scientific and technological community under the white terror, reigniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This was a brilliant meeting shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, a turning point in the cultural revolution of the Academy. As Comrade Chen Boda predicted: "This accidental gathering may produce great effects, may produce great effects that we cannot foresee now." He said, one year later today, we gather here again to establish the Revolutionary Committee of the Academy and solemnly commemorate this historic and brilliant day in the scientific and technological community. This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

He said with unwavering confidence: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been overthrown by us, and the Revolutionary Committee has been established. This indicates that the Academy will become a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought, will follow the course set by Chairman Mao to catch up with and surpass the world's scientific and technological level, and create the most advanced science and technology in the world.

Representative Wang Xiping of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences spoke next. He reviewed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences over the past year. He said, the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences marks the decisive victory of the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries of the Academy to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; it marks the decisive victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the Academy; it marks the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Academy into a new stage. This new stage is to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to closely combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle-criticism-transformation of the Academy, and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He narrated the main experiences of the proletarian revolutionaries of the Academy in achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of power-holders within the unit who are taking the capitalist road. He proposed that the main tasks of the revolutionary forces of the Academy in the future are: to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the criticism; to raise the level of revolutionary criticism to a new height, to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the criticism, to promote the struggle-criticism-transformation of the entire Academy; to seriously transform the leadership style, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Firmly respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "save on revolution," "grasp revolution and promote production," oppose all old bureaucratic habits, achieve the simplification and revolutionization of the organs, and catch up with the world's advanced level in scientific research.

Academy President and Revolutionary Committee member Guo Moruo, in high spirits, composed a poem to celebrate the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee. He recited a poem titled "July 30th" at the meeting.

Comrade Su Yu also spoke at the meeting, congratulating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He said, the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement in the Academy is excellent. He encouraged everyone to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, not to become complacent and self-satisfied upon seeing achievements. Continue to fully mobilize the broad masses, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating "fallen dogs," concentrate wisdom, concentrate strength, concentrate targets, and from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly settle and purge their revisionist poison in all fields and domains. He finally said, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have entrusted the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries" to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, instructing the army to firmly support the genuine proletarian revolutionaries. We will definitely follow the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, firmly support you, learn from you, unite with you, fight with you, and achieve victory with you.

Those who spoke at the meeting to express warm congratulations on the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also included Wu De, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality, and Zhang Ben, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the State Science and Technology Commission.

The meeting adopted a letter of respect to Chairman Mao.
