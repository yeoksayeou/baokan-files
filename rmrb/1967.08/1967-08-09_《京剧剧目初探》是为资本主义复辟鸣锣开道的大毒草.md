The poisonous weed "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory," which was published in 1957 and reprinted in 1963, is a classic example of how the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road uses old Peking opera to engage in counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

What kind of trash is "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory"? Under the guise of a "reference book," it openly erects monuments to old Peking opera. The entire book collects over 1,300 old Peking opera repertoires, arranged by dynasty, starting from the beginning of time, through various feudal dynasties, to the end of the Republic of China, and so-called modern and contemporary themes. Additionally, it dedicates a separate chapter to operas with unknown dynasties and newly edited historical operas. The old Peking opera repertoires collected in this book are almost all the dregs of feudalism and capitalism. They sing the praises of emperors, generals, and scholars, and promote the reactionary ideology of the exploiting class, glorifying debauchery and murder, praising surrender and betrayal, vilifying the laboring people, slandering peasant revolutionary struggles, and beautifying traitors, running dogs, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Some even use the method of "borrowing from the past to criticize the present" to openly plead for counter-revolutionary elements and right-opportunists, directly attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, attacking the great Chinese Communist Party, attacking the socialist system, and attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The author of this book, Tao Junqi, is a reactionary literary figure who adheres to the landlord-bourgeois standpoint. Before liberation, he attached himself to Hu Shi, shamelessly calling Hu Shi his "mentor." After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wrote to the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, offering strategies for his anti-communist and anti-people actions, and received Chiang Kai-shek's "approval" in a reply, asking him to "assist from the side." After national liberation, this reactionary literary figure, under the protection of the clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road, produced a large number of poisonous weeds, such as the ghost play "Li Huiniang" and "A Blooming Red Plum Blossom," as well as "A Brief History of Peking Opera" and "Peking Opera Woodcuts" for the old Peking opera. The poisonous weed "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" was produced to meet the needs of the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road for restoring capitalism and was produced under their support.

After this poisonous weed was released, it was firmly opposed by the proletarian revolutionary faction. In the spring of 1963, Comrade Jiang Qing and Comrade Ke Qingshi successively pointed out: "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" is a bad book and should be criticized. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang, Qi Yanming, Zhang Geng, and their gang, under the support of the Khrushchev of China, refused to criticize this bad book.

At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a decisive battle between the two classes and two lines, the "Summary of the Discussion on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" was publicly issued. This brilliant document solemnly points out: "Regarding some representative erroneous viewpoints in the field of literary and art theory, and some people's attempts to fabricate history, elevate themselves, and the many erroneous viewpoints spread in books such as 'A History of the Development of Chinese Cinema,' 'A Collection of Historical Materials on the Fifty-Year Movement of Chinese Spoken Drama,' and 'The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory,' we must carry out a thorough criticism in a planned manner."

Debts must be repaid. This poisonous weed that paves the way for the restoration of capitalism must be thoroughly criticized, and the counter-revolutionary crimes of the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road using old Peking opera to engage in capitalist restoration activities must be thoroughly settled.

I

"The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" was first published in 1957, a time when the bourgeois rightists were fiercely attacking the Party and socialism, and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads was extremely sharp.

At that time, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the people of our country had successfully completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. Facing this good situation, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, Chairman Mao issued a call to arms. He taught us: "Class struggle has not ended." "The question of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm has not been truly resolved. We will have to wage a long struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology."

The biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road acted as the spokesperson for the landlord-bourgeoisie. The Khrushchev of China, in order to achieve his goal of restoring capitalism in China, vigorously promoted the theory of the extinction of class struggle and peddled this reactionary theory into the fields of opera and Peking opera, using literature and art to create public opinion for his restoration of capitalism. In March 1956, the Khrushchev of China, at the work report meeting of the old Ministry of Culture Party Group, issued a black directive, saying that "opera reform should not be changed too much," "some old operas have educational significance and should not be changed," "new literary and art workers should go to opera troupes to reform operas, ... the changes should not be too excessive, and should not be changed too early," "Peking opera has a high artistic level and should not be belittled or changed indiscriminately."

This is a direct contradiction to the important instructions given by our great leader Chairman Mao on opera, such as "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "use the past to serve the present, and use foreign things to serve China."

However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists who usurped the leadership of the literary and art world regarded the black directives of the Khrushchev of China as sacred edicts and greatly elaborated on them, immediately putting them into practice. Zhou Yang, following the intentions of his master, said that "the fundamental reason for our failure is that we mechanically understood 'innovating the old' to mean that we must discard the old to bring forth the new. I think that new things must be brought forth from the old, and we must not separate from the old things." Under the guidance of this reactionary view of "comprehensive inheritance," the six or seven hundred old Peking opera repertoires "excavated" by Tao Junqi became their treasures, becoming the capital for the clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road to use old Peking opera to engage in capitalist restoration activities. They, based on the six or seven hundred old Peking opera repertoires provided by Tao Junqi, compiled two repertoires for the comprehensive revival of old Peking opera: "A Classification and Evaluation Table of Peking Opera Repertoires" and "A Classification Table of Steps for the Reorganization and Rewriting of Peking Opera Repertoires," as important materials for the leaders and professional workers of opera repertoires from all over the country to learn from, as the blueprint for the reorganization and rewriting of repertoires by various troupes. Under the strong support of this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists, various reactionary and pornographic plays flooded the stage, causing the stage across the country to be filled with demons and ghosts, and the stage to be filled with evil spirits.

This was a frenzied counterattack by the landlord-bourgeoisie, under the support and protection of the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road, against the proletariat on the socialist opera stage. It is worth noting that this was just before the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. The rampant demons and ghosts on the stage sounded the opening gong for the bourgeois rightists' attack.

Because the rampant demons and ghosts on the stage completely met the needs of this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists for restoring capitalism, the six or seven hundred old Peking opera repertoires collected by Tao Junqi not only received their full approval but were also instructed to continue to collect them urgently. As a result, in less than a year, the original six or seven hundred Peking opera repertoires suddenly increased to over 1,200 and were compiled into a book, published in 1957 when the bourgeois rightists were fiercely attacking the Party and socialism, timely providing a large number of shells for the class enemies to attack the Party and socialism.

The publication of "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" had serious consequences in society. Various places imitated the practices of "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory," using the excuse of "excavating traditions" to comprehensively erect monuments to old operas and old Peking opera. Even some old plays that had long been ignored were dug up as treasures, temporarily forming a trend of "excavating traditions." At the same time, reactionary speeches opposing opera reform were rampant. Zhao Shuli from Shanxi proposed "re-selecting rather than re-changing, and re-changing slightly rather than greatly." Rightists from Fujian proposed "first releasing and then changing." Rightists from Shandong shouted that "letting a hundred flowers bloom" meant "letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Rightists from Inner Mongolia even proudly sang, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, sing whatever you want, let a hundred schools of thought contend, say whatever you want." Look! How fiercely the bourgeois rightists and reactionary literary figures attacked the proletariat!

Because "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" played a reactionary role in paving the way for the restoration of capitalism, it was applauded by counter-revolutionary revisionists. Qi Yanming and Zhang Geng and their ilk praised it as a "model" of "excavating traditions." When "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" was first published, the reactionary literary figure Tao Junqi maliciously sang, "I received 'The Initial Exploration' and laughed heartily, I was suspected of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom' for you, I endured the slander for you, I threw away my grievances. Fortunately, the leadership is fair, and the dark clouds on the ground were swept away. Now that the book is completed, my heart is at ease, I will gather my spirits and explore again." From this, one can see the author's boundless gratitude to his masters, and at the same time, it fully exposes the black hearts of these counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary literary figures, hating the Party and the people, and exposing their counter-revolutionary faces.

In 1963, when the Khrushchev of China, together with the class enemies in society, stirred up a series of winds of restoring capitalism, "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" was re-released after the author's careful cultivation over the years and under the repeated urging of the clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road.

The "revised edition" of "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" published in 1963, compared to the first edition published in 1957, had a more malignant development in its reactionary nature. In the "revised edition," not only were the over 1,200 old Peking opera repertoires in the first edition included, but also the newly appeared so-called new historical dramas and modern theme plays with serious reactionary political tendencies were collected, and they were discussed in detail and enthusiastically promoted. For example, for the rehabilitation of right-opportunists and to encourage them to continue their failed attempts, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Hai Rui's Memorial," and "Hai Rui Carries the Boat" were included in the newly opened chapters of the "revised edition," and with the name of "having been tested on stage and being popular among the masses," they were praised and recommended. On the contrary, for some good modern plays, they were excluded with the names of "inappropriate" and "better to have fewer than more."

The counter-revolutionary political purpose of the publication of the "revised edition" of "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" is very clear. It adapts to the political needs of the Khrushchev of China for restoring capitalism, and for the counter-revolutionary reverse current he initiated, it stirs up waves and creates public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration.

II

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of who serves whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

The biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road openly opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and socialism. Together with a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and art world, they obstinately promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art line, advocating the theory of "literature and art for the whole people," using it to serve their counter-revolutionary revisionist political line.

The poisonous weed "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" is a living example of the "literature and art for the whole people" theory peddled by the Khrushchev of China in the fields of opera and Peking opera.

In "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory," the reactionary literary figure Tao Junqi, with the same tone as the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road, raises the banner of "excavating traditions," saying that "the main method of excavating and organizing traditional operas is to first open the door of the opera heritage treasury and display all the treasures inside"; saying that most old Peking opera repertoires "after careful examination and sifting, still contain infinite value." Even saying that "this is very beneficial for expanding and enriching the work of performing repertoires; at the same time, it also provides conditions for rewriting and creating new repertoires."

This is a thoroughly reactionary proposal to serve the bourgeoisie and a small clique of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

In 1944, Chairman Mao, in "A Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe After Watching 'The Story of the Water Margin,'" pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old opera stage (and all old literature and art that are separated from the people), the people have become dregs, ruled by lords, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses." This clearly reveals the reactionary nature of old operas and old Peking opera.

The history of the formation and development of old Peking opera also fully demonstrates its reactionary nature of serving the landlord-bourgeoisie. The period of the formation and development of old Peking opera was precisely the period when our country became a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. After the birth of old Peking opera, whether it was the feudal ruling class, imperialism, or the Kuomintang reactionaries, they all used it as a tool to rule the people. For example, during the reigns of Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, when the Nian Army and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolutionary movements were surging, and the Qing Dynasty's rule was on the verge of collapse, to meet the needs of the Qing Dynasty's ruling class to suppress the people's resistance at that time, operas that advocated surrender and betrayal and beautified traitors became very popular. The famous "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother" was born at this time. In addition, operas that sang the praises of Shi Shiren, Peng Peng, and Huang Tianba, who helped the ruling class suppress peasant uprisings, also emerged at this time. Although the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty's rule, the feudal ghosts of the old scholars and literati did not disperse, so the Peking opera stage saw a batch of operas that summoned the souls of the feudal dynasties. Later, with the bourgeoisie taking the political stage, a batch of operas that advocated the bourgeois lords, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses, and the decadence of the bourgeoisie, such as "Family Feuds," "Jing Hua's Tears," "Civilized People," and "The Sea of Sin," emerged one after another. The Kuomintang reactionaries not only inherited all these operas but also developed them maliciously to meet the needs of the reactionary rule of imperialism, big landlords, and big bourgeoisie.

During the period of Japanese imperialist occupation, in addition to the rampant feudal superstitions and yellow pornographic plays, they also staged so-called "security strengthening" plays, such as "The Eight Great Captures," "The Iron Crown," "The Happy Destiny," "The Capture of Fang La," and "The Elimination of Bandits," as tools to strengthen reactionary rule and make reactionary propaganda for the Japanese invaders. Even more shamefully, a group of traitors and reactionary literary figures, through the rewriting of old Peking opera, directly cooperated with the Japanese invaders' attacks on the liberated areas. For example, using "Ban Chao Throws Away His Writing Brush" to sing the praises of the Japanese invaders' "martial arts," using "North and South United" to cooperate with the seduction of Chiang Kai-shek, and using "The Capture of Nanjing" to propagate the Japanese army's capture of Nanjing, etc. Facts are the most eloquent. The history of the formation and development of old Peking opera is a history of serving the reactionary rule of the landlord-bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In China, there is imperialist culture, which reflects the political and economic domination or semi-domination of imperialism over China." "In China, there is also semi-feudal culture, which reflects semi-feudal politics and semi-feudal economy." "This kind of reactionary culture is a tool for imperialism and the feudal class, and it should be overthrown."

The over 1,300 old Peking opera repertoires collected in "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" are mostly of this kind that serves the feudal class, bourgeoisie, and imperialism. For this kind of reactionary thing, it is not a matter of "excavating," "organizing," "examining," and "sifting," but a matter of burying them thoroughly, implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat on them, and making them never able to rise again.

However, the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road, in order to use old Peking opera to engage in capitalist restoration activities, beautifies and praises old Peking opera in every way. The Khrushchev of China said: "Propagating feudalism is not afraid, even monks and nuns are not forbidden, let alone operas." "The novels and scripts written now are often not as good as those of the feudal period, so operas are performed with 'emperors, generals, and scholars,' 'talented scholars and beautiful women'." He praises the operas that propagate the philosophy of traitors and the philosophy of survival, such as "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother," and the operas that beautify feudal landlord running dogs, such as "The Village of Evil Tigers," as well as the obscene and vulgar "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix," as "well-revised operas" that still "have educational significance" and "can be sung without harm." Zhou Yang, following the intentions of his master, openly shouted, "Excavating heritage is decisive for the development of socialist literature and art and nationalization." Zhang Geng also said that "Chinese opera is basically created by the people and basically created for the people." This is a thoroughly shameful lie of surrendering to the landlord-bourgeoisie. The reactionary literary figure Tao Junqi fully understands the reactionary views of the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road. In "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory," he vigorously peddles the theory of "literature and art for the whole people," comprehensively falsifies and fabricates the history of old Peking opera, puts makeup on old Peking opera, and dresses it up. He says that old Peking opera "is mostly created by the laboring people and predecessors, expressing the strong love and hate of the people, and has always been popular among the people." He also says that old Peking opera "is like a pearl, even if it is buried in the soil, after wiping off the dust, it still retains its original luster." He does this to dress up old Peking opera as so-called "super-class" and "super-era" "literature and art for the whole people," using it to cover up the reactionary nature of old Peking opera serving the exploiting class.

For this kind of evil deed of reversing black and white, we must thoroughly expose it.

The reactionary ruling class has always used old Peking opera as a tool to rule the people's minds, which is an iron fact. Then, who wrote the old Peking opera? A look at history reveals that those who were beautified by Zhou Yang as "people's writers" and "artists," and those who were praised by Tao Junqi as having "amazing and vast" creative power, were all a group of running dogs and slaves who were loyal to the reactionary ruling class. For example, the person who wrote over 70 old Peking operas in his life and vigorously promoted feudal ideology, Qing Yi Ju Shi, was a royal relative of the Qing Dynasty. Among the other authors, there were big officials of the Beiyang warlords, big and small officials of the Kuomintang reactionary government, traitors, spies, and a group of old scholars, literati, and shameless literary figures. Which one of them is a "laboring person"? None. They are a group of demons and ghosts, and they have long been spit on by the people and thrown into the garbage heap of history. However, a small clique of those who walk the capitalist road, out of counter-revolutionary political needs, regard these demons and ghosts and the old Peking opera they wrote as treasures. They do this only to use the corpse of old Peking opera to continue to summon the souls of capitalism on the socialist opera stage today, to serve the bourgeoisie and a small clique of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

To open the door for these poisonous weeds to be released, the reactionary literary figure Tao Junqi, based on the "literature and art for the whole people" theory concocted by the biggest clique within the Party that walks the capitalist road, threw out a "super-class" standard for measuring operas. This is to use so-called "anti-invasion," "loyalty and chastity," "anti-feudalism," "justice and kindness," "self-sacrifice," "talent," "love," and other abstract phrases to comprehensively affirm the value of old Peking opera today.

The standard used to measure operas is a fundamental issue of which class the opera serves. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the epoch-making work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," proposed six political standards for distinguishing between flowers and weeds. He especially emphasized: "Among these six standards, the most important are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party."

The reactionary literary figure Tao Junqi, however, sings a different tune. The standard for measuring operas he threw out is a pure landlord-bourgeois political standard, formulated according to the reactionary views advocated by the Khrushchev of China, such as "opera reform should not be changed too much, slightly harmful should be changed, not harmful should not be changed," "operas with poor ideological content but strong technical content can also be changed in content, keeping the technique, inheriting artistic achievements," "if watching an opera can bring relaxation and make people happy, it is very good," etc.

According to this standard for measuring operas, almost all old Peking operas can be affirmed and can appear in the socialist era today. For example, he classifies the opera that advocates dying for the emperor as "anti-invasion," the opera that sings the praises of slave morality and promotes feudal family revenge thoughts as "justice and kindness, self-sacrifice," the opera that promotes feudal morality as "anti-feudal etiquette," and even the opera that thoroughly promotes feudal orthodox thoughts, "The Second Entry into the Palace," is also said to be a good opera with "critical significance." For those operas with extremely obvious reactionary content, Tao Junqi plays another evil trick, that is, making a big deal out of so-called artistic features. In the "Preface," he says, "Sometimes, the artistic features of some operas, the main roles, and different schools are briefly explained." Under the banner of "strong artistic features," another batch of reactionary operas are praised to the skies. For example, the reactionary opera "Meilong Town" (also known as "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix") and "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother," which were praised by the Khrushchev of China, are introduced in detail in the book, from artistic features to the genre and different names of the opera, all are explained in detail.

The standard for measuring operas thrown out in "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory," no matter what banners of "super-class," "super-era," "strong artistic features," etc., are raised, they cannot cover up their reactionary nature of landlord-bourgeois political standards. If we peel off their skin, we can discover that their so-called "unyielding," is to make slaves sell their lives for their masters, to serve the reactionary ruling class wholeheartedly; their so-called "anti-violence," is to sing the praises of the reactionary ruling class's bloody suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the laboring people; their so-called "justice and kindness," is to maintain the reasonableness of the reactionary ruling class's exploitation and oppression, and to make rebellion a crime; their so-called "love," is the debauchery and shamelessness of the landlord-bourgeoisie. Their so-called "strong artistic features" is an excuse to oppose the political standards of the proletariat. Under the banner of "strong artistic features," they can do whatever they want to bring those reactionary operas onto the socialist stage, to create counter-revolutionary public opinion for the Khrushchev of China, and to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art line, thoroughly criticize the black model "The Initial Exploration of Peking Opera Repertory" that paves the way for the restoration of capitalism, and sing loudly for the revolutionary model Peking operas that have shone brightly on the socialist opera stage in our country, so that the stage in our country will forever and ever shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    《京剧剧目初探》是为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的大毒草
    中国戏曲研究院全体革命同志
    一九五七年出版，并在一九六三年增订再版的大毒草《京剧剧目初探》，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，利用旧京剧进行反革命复辟活动的一个黑标本。
    《京剧剧目初探》是什么样的货色？它打着所谓“资料书”的幌子，公开为旧京剧树碑立传。全书收集旧京剧剧目一千三百多个，按朝代排列起来，上自开天辟地，中经历代封建皇朝，终至民国故事戏和所谓近代现代题材戏。另外还专辟章节收录朝代不明的戏和新编历史戏。这本书收录的旧京剧剧目，几乎都是封建主义、资本主义的糟粕。它们歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人，鼓吹剥削阶级的反动思想，渲染淫毒、凶杀，赞扬投降变节，丑化劳动人民，污蔑农民革命斗争，美化叛徒、汉奸和国民党反动派。有的甚至采取借古讽今的手法，公然为反党分子、右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，直接攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，攻击伟大的中国共产党，攻击社会主义制度，攻击无产阶级专政。
    这本书的编著者陶君起，是一个坚持地主资产阶级立场的反动文人。解放前，他投靠在胡适的门下，厚颜无耻地称胡适为“导师”。抗日战争胜利后，他向人民公敌蒋介石上书，为蒋介石反共反人民出谋划策，得到了蒋介石反动政府的“嘉许”，复信要他“从旁协助”。全国解放以后，这个反动文人在党内走资本主义道路当权派的庇护下，又炮制了大量的毒草，如大捧鬼戏《李慧娘》的《一朵鲜艳的红梅》，以及为旧京剧张目的《京剧史话》《京剧版画》等等。大毒草《京剧剧目初探》，就是为了适应党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的需要，并在他们的支持下炮制出来的。
    这部大毒草出笼以后，受到了无产阶级革命派的坚决反对。一九六三年春，江青同志和柯庆施同志先后指出：《京剧剧目初探》是本坏书，要批判。但是，反革命修正主义分子周扬、齐燕铭、张庚等一伙在中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持下，拒绝对这部坏书进行批判。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条路线大决战的时候，《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》公开发表了。这个光辉的文件严正指出：“对于文艺理论方面一些有代表性的错误论点，和某些人在一些什么《中国电影发展史》《中国话剧运动五十年史料集》《京剧剧目初探》之类的书中企图伪造历史、抬高自己，以及所散布的许多错误论点，都要有计划地进行彻底的批判。”
    欠债必须偿还。这部为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的大毒草必须进行彻底批判，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利用旧京剧进行资本主义复辟活动的反革命罪行，必须彻底的清算。
    一
    《京剧剧目初探》初版于一九五七年，这是资产阶级右派分子向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争十分尖锐激烈的时期。
    当时，我国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，胜利地完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。面对着这个大好形势，为把社会主义革命进行到底，毛主席向我们发出战斗号召。他教导我们：“阶级斗争并没有结束”。“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，充当了地主资产阶级的代言人。中国的赫鲁晓夫为了达到他在中国复辟资本主义的目的，大肆宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，并把这种反动理论贩卖到戏曲、京剧界来，利用文艺来为他复辟资本主义制造舆论。一九五六年三月，中国的赫鲁晓夫在旧文化部党组汇报工作会上大发黑指示，胡说什么“戏改不要大改”，“有些老戏很有教育意义，不要去改。”“新文艺工作者到戏曲剧团搞戏改，……改的不要过分，不要过早地改。”“京剧艺术水平很高，不要轻视，不能乱改。”
    这是公然同我们伟大领袖毛主席对戏曲提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”，“古为今用，洋为中用”等重要指示唱反调。
    但是，窃据了文艺界领导权的反革命修正主义分子，却把中国的赫鲁晓夫的黑指示奉为圣旨，并大加发挥，立即付之于实践。周扬秉承其主子旨意，胡说什么“（我们）失败的基本原因，就是对‘推陈出新’这几个字机械地去理解，以为把陈的推掉，才能出新的。我以为新的东西，一定要从陈的里面推出来，一定不能离开陈的东西。”在这种“全盘继承”论的反动观点指使下，陶君起“挖掘”出来的六、七百个旧京剧剧目成了他们的宝贝，成了党内走资本主义道路当权派利用旧京剧进行资本主义复辟活动的资本。他们根据陶君起提供的六、七百个旧京剧剧目，搞了两个为使旧京剧全面复活的剧目表：《京剧剧目鉴别分类表》和《京剧剧目整理、改编步骤分类表》，作为来自全国各地的戏曲剧目工作领导者和专业工作人员学习的重要材料，作为各剧团改编、整理剧目的蓝本。就在这伙反革命修正主义分子的大力扶植下，各种各样的反动戏、色情戏纷纷登上舞台，闹得全国舞台上群魔乱舞，妖气冲天。
    这是地主资产阶级在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派支持和庇护下，在社会主义戏曲舞台上向无产阶级进行的一次疯狂的大反扑。值得注意的是，当时正是资产阶级右派猖狂地向党向社会主义进攻的前夕。舞台上的这种牛鬼蛇神的大泛滥，为资产阶级右派的进攻敲起了开场锣鼓。
    正因为舞台上牛鬼蛇神的大泛滥完全适应了这伙反革命修正主义分子复辟资本主义的需要，因而陶君起所搜罗的六、七百个旧京剧剧目，不仅得到了他们全盘肯定，而且他们还指使他继续加紧搜罗。结果在不到一年的时间里，原来的六、七百个京剧剧目陡然暴增到一千二百多个，并编集成书，就在资产阶级右派向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的一九五七年付排出版，为阶级敌人向党向社会主义进攻及时地提供了大量的炮弹。
    《京剧剧目初探》的出版，在社会上产生了严重的恶果。各地纷纷仿照《京剧剧目初探》的做法，打着“挖掘传统”的幌子，全面地为旧戏曲、旧京剧树碑立传。甚至某些早已无人过问的种种坏戏，也被当作至宝挖了出来，一时形成了一股“挖掘传统”的歪风。同时，反对戏曲改革的反动言论也甚嚣尘上。山西的赵树理提出了“重选不重改，重小改不重大改。”福建的右派分子提出了“先放后改”。山东的右派分子叫嚷有了“齐放”，就是“争鸣”。内蒙古的右派分子更得意忘形地唱道：“百花齐放，什么都唱，百家争鸣，咋说咋行。”看！资产阶级右派分子和反动文人向无产阶级进攻猖狂到了何种地步！
    正因为《京剧剧目初探》起到了为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的反动作用，因而受到反革命修正主义分子的喝采。齐燕铭、张庚之流对之大捧特捧，誉之为“挖掘传统”的“标本”。《京剧剧目初探》第一次出版时，反动文人陶君起恶毒地吟唱道：“接到《初探》笑开怀，我为你‘鸣放’受疑猜，我为你受诬权忍耐，我嫌怨两丢开。幸喜领导公道在，才得平地扫阴霾。到如今书成心安泰，打起精神再探来”。从这里可以看到作者对他的主子们的无限感激，同时充分暴露了这些反革命修正主义分子和反动文人仇恨党、仇恨人民的黑心肠，暴露了他们继续向党进攻的反革命面目。
    一九六三年，正当中国的赫鲁晓夫伙同社会上的阶级敌人刮起一阵阵复辟资本主义妖风的时候，《京剧剧目初探》经过作者几年来“打起精神再探来”的悉心经营，在党内走资本主义道路当权派的多次催促下再度出笼了。
    一九六三年出版的《京剧剧目初探》“增订本”，比起一九五七年初版本来，其反动性更有了恶性的发展。在“增订本”中，不仅把初版本中一千二百多个旧京剧剧目全部囊括其中，而且把新出现的那些有着严重反动政治倾向的所谓新编历史剧和现代题材戏也搜罗了进去，并详加论述，狂热鼓吹。例如为右倾机会主义分子翻案，并鼓舞他们失败了再干的《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞背纤》，以及歌颂错误路线，为反党分子、大野心家、大阴谋家树碑立传的一些现代题材戏，都列入“增订本”新开辟的章节中，并以所谓“经过舞台考验、在群众中较为流行”为名，对之狂加吹捧，大肆推荐。相反，对一些好的现代戏，它却以“不伦不类”“宁缺毋滥”等罪名将其排斥于外。
    《京剧剧目初探》“增订本”出版的反革命政治目的是十分清楚的。它适应中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的政治需要，为他所掀起的反革命逆流兴波助澜，大造反革命复辟舆论。

  　毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然对抗毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的革命文艺路线。他伙同文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义文艺路线，鼓吹“全民文艺”论，以此来为他的反革命修正主义政治路线服务。
    大毒草《京剧剧目初探》就是中国的赫鲁晓夫在戏曲界、京剧界贩卖的“全民文艺”论的活标本。
    在《京剧剧目初探》中，反动文人陶君起操着同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一样的腔调，打起“挖掘传统”的旗号，胡说什么“挖掘和整理传统剧的主要办法，是先打开戏曲遗产宝库的大门，陈列出库里所有的宝藏”；胡说什么绝大部分旧京剧剧目“经过比较细致的扪?和搜剔以后，还是蕴有无限的价值。”甚至说“这对于扩大和丰富上演剧目的工作，是非常有利的；同时也为改编、创作新剧目提供了条件。”
    这是一个彻头彻尾为资产阶级服务，为一小撮地、富、反、坏、右服务的反动主张。
      一九四四年，毛主席在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”。这就最明确不过地揭示了旧戏曲、旧京剧的反动本质。
    旧京剧的形成和发展的历史，也充分表明了它的地主资产阶级的反动本质。旧京剧形成发展的时期，正是我国沦为半封建半殖民地社会的时期。旧京剧产生以后无论是封建统治阶级、帝国主义，还是国民党反动派，都曾利用它来作为统治人民的工具。例如在清代道光、咸丰、同治、光绪年间，正当捻军、太平天国等农民革命运动风起云涌，清王朝的统治摇摇欲坠的时候，为了适应当时清朝统治阶级镇压人民反抗的需要，那些宣扬投降变节、美化叛徒的剧目大为流行。名噪一时的《四郎探母》就是在这个时候产生的。此外，歌颂施仕伦、彭朋、黄天霸这样一些帮助统治阶级镇压农民起义的刽子手的剧目，也在这时应运而生。辛亥革命虽然推翻了清朝的统治，可是那些封建遗老遗少们的封建阴魂不散，于是京剧舞台上又出现了一批为封建王朝亡灵招魂的剧目。此后，随着资产阶级登上政治舞台，又相继出现了一批宣扬资产阶级老爷太太、少爷小姐洋场角逐、纸醉金迷的剧目，诸如《家庭恩怨记》《荆花泪》《文明人》《孽海波澜》等等。国民党反动派不仅全部继承了这些剧目，并且加以恶性的发展，以适应帝国主义、大地主、大资产阶级反动统治的需要。
    在日本帝国主义侵占时期，除封建迷信、黄色下流戏大肆泛滥外，还大搞所谓“治安强化”戏，如《八大拿》、《铁冠图》、《得意缘》、《擒方腊》、《荡寇志》等等，作为加强反动统治，为日寇作反动宣传的工具。更甚者，一批无耻的汉奸和反动文人，通过改编旧京剧来直接配合日寇对解放区的进攻。如以《班超投笔》来歌颂日本侵略者的“武功”，以《南北合》来配合对蒋介石的诱降，以《取金陵》来宣扬日军攻陷南京等等。事实最雄辩不过地证明，旧京剧形成和发展的历史，就是一部为地主资产阶级反动统治服务的历史。
    毛主席教导我们：“在中国，有帝国主义文化，这是反映帝国主义在政治上经济上统治或半统治中国的东西。”“在中国，又有半封建文化，这是反映半封建政治和半封建经济的东西”，“这类反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。”
    搜罗在《京剧剧目初探》中的一千三百多个旧京剧剧目，绝大部分就是属于这种为封建阶级、资产阶级和帝国主义服务的反动货色。对于这类反动的东西，绝不是什么“挖掘”“整理”“扪?”“搜剔”的问题，而应当是把它们彻底埋葬，对它们实行无产阶级专政，叫它们永世不得翻身的问题。
    但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了利用旧京剧进行资本主义复辟活动，却百般美化、大肆吹捧旧京剧。中国的赫鲁晓夫说：“宣传封建，不怕，和尚尼姑都不禁，还禁戏。”“现在写的小说，剧本，也常常不如封建时期的好，所以演戏就演‘帝王将相’，‘才子佳人’”。他把宣扬叛徒哲学、活命哲学的《四郎探母》、美化封建地主走狗的《恶虎村》以及淫荡下流的《游龙戏凤》，都吹捧为“改得好的剧目”，在今天仍“有教育意义”、“唱了也不要紧”。周扬秉承其主子的旨意，公然叫嚣“挖掘遗产对发展社会主义文艺和民族化有决定意义。”张庚也胡说什么“中国的戏曲基本上是由人民创造的，而且基本上也是为人民而创造的”。这是彻头彻尾的向地主资产阶级投降的无耻谰言。反动文人陶君起，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动观点心领神会。在《京剧剧目初探》中，他大肆贩卖“全民文艺”论，全面地篡改、伪造旧京剧的历史，为旧京剧涂脂抹粉，梳妆打扮。他胡说旧京剧“大多数是劳动人民和先辈艺人们所创造的，表现了人民的强烈爱憎，一向为人民大众所喜闻乐见。”又说旧京剧“就象明珠，虽被埋在土中，拂去尘垢，依然保有它原有的光芒。”他这样做，目的是把旧京剧打扮成所谓“超阶级”“超时代”的“全民戏剧”，借以掩盖旧京剧为剥削阶级服务的反动本质。
    对于这种颠倒黑白的罪恶勾当，我们必须给予彻底揭穿。
    反动统治阶级一贯把旧京剧作为他们统治人民思想的工具，这已是铁的事实。那么，编写旧京剧的又是些什么样的人呢？一查历史，原来，那批被周扬美化为“人民文学家”“艺术家”，被陶君起吹捧为创作力“惊人博大”的“戏曲作家”，都是一批效忠于反动统治阶级的走卒，奴才。例如一生写了七十多出旧京戏，大肆宣扬封建主义思想的清逸居士，就是清朝的皇亲贵族。其他作者中有的是北洋军阀的大官僚，有的是国民党反动政府的大小官吏，有的是汉奸、间谍，还有一批是遗老遗少和无耻文人。这些人中哪一个是“劳动人民”呢？没有。他们是一群不折不扣的牛鬼蛇神，而且早已为人民所唾弃，被人民抛进了历史的垃圾堆。但是，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派出于反革命的政治需要，却把这些牛鬼蛇神及其所编的旧京剧当作宝贝。他们这样做，无非是想借助旧京剧这具僵尸，在今天社会主义的戏曲舞台上，继续为资本主义的亡灵招魂，为资产阶级和一小撮地、富、反、坏、右服务。
    为了给这些毒草出笼大开方便之门，反动文人陶君起根据党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的“全民文艺”论，抛出了一个“超阶级”的衡量剧目的标准。这就是用所谓“反侵略”、“忠贞气节”、“反封建”、“正义善良”、“舍己救人”、“才能”、“爱情”等抽象词句，全面地肯定旧京剧在今天存在的价值。
    用什么标准来衡量剧目，这是关系到戏曲为什么阶级服务的根本问题。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部划时代的著作中，提出了区别香花与毒草的六条政治标准。并且特别强调地提出：“这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”
    反动文人陶君起却大唱反调。他所抛出的衡量剧目的标准，是十足的地主资产阶级的政治标准，是按照中国的赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的什么“戏改不要大改，有害稍改，无害不改”，“思想性差技术性强的戏，也可以改了内容，把技术留下来，继承艺术成果”，“看了戏能得到休息，使人高兴，就很好”等等反动观点炮制出来的。
    根据这个衡量剧目的标准，几乎所有的旧京剧都可以肯定，都能在今天社会主义时代出现。比如，他把宣扬为皇帝尽忠替死的《金沙滩》划在“反侵略”的一类，把歌颂奴隶道德、鼓吹封建家族复仇思想的《搜孤救孤》《法场换子》划在“正义善良、舍己救人”的一类，把宣扬封建道德的《三击掌》划在“反抗封建礼教”的一类，甚至把彻头彻尾宣扬封建正统思想的《二进宫》，也说成是“带有批判意味”的好剧目。对于那些内容有着极其明显反动性的剧目，陶君起耍了另一招恶毒的手法，即从所谓艺术性上大做文章。他在《凡例》中说，“间亦对一些剧目的艺术特点，以何角色为主，不同流派等略加说明”。在这种“艺术性强”的幌子下，又有一批反动剧目被吹得天花乱坠。例如被中国的赫鲁晓夫吹捧的反动剧目《梅龙镇》（即《游龙戏凤》）和《四郎探母》，作者在书中介绍得详尽备至，从艺术特点到剧种、同剧异名上，无不一一详加说明。
    《京剧剧目初探》中抛出的这个衡量剧目的标准，不管打着什么“超阶级”“超时代”“艺术性强”等种种旗号，但都掩盖不住其地主资产阶级的政治标准的反动本质。剥开其画皮一看，我们可以发现他们鼓吹的所谓“坚贞不屈”，就是要奴才替主子卖命，死心塌地地为反动统治阶级效劳；所谓“除暴”，就是歌颂反动统治阶级对劳动人民的革命斗争进行血腥镇压；所谓“正义善良”，就是维护反动统治阶级的剥削有理，压迫有理，造反有罪；所谓“爱情”，就是地主资产阶级的荒淫无耻的男盗女娼。他们所谓的“艺术性强”，是反对无产阶级政治标准的一个遁词，在“艺术性强”的幌子下，他们可以为所欲为地把那些反动剧目搬上社会主义的舞台，来为中国的赫鲁晓夫大造反革命舆论，为资本主义的复辟鸣锣开道。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清除反革命修正主义文艺路线，彻底批判为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的黑标本《京剧剧目初探》，为已经在我国社会主义戏曲舞台上大放光彩的革命现代京剧样板戏放声歌唱，让我国的社会主义舞台上，永远永远放射着毛泽东思想光芒。
