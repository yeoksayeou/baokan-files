Capital came into the world dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt. — Marx

The Capitalists' Loyal Defender

Yī Bīng

What is exploitation? What is being exploited? This is a basic question of Marxism. Yet, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, who claims to be an "old revolutionary," deliberately confuses the boundaries between exploitation and being exploited, beautifies the bourgeoisie, and prepares public opinion for the development of capitalism.

In the spring of 1949, as soon as he entered the city from the countryside, he eagerly appeared in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places as an "authoritative figure" of the Communist Party. Again and again, he declared to the capitalists: "You capitalists are both exploiters and the exploited; you exploit workers, but you are also exploited by imperialism, and by the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families of the Nationalist Party." The world has never seen capitalists who are exploited!

This is a major "discovery" by China's Khrushchev.

What is exploitation? In simple terms, it means that a part of the labor fruits of workers and peasants is seized by landlords and capitalists. Clearly, those who are exploited are the laboring people. Capitalists are genuine exploiters. In old China, the national bourgeoisie had contradictions with imperialism and the reactionary Nationalist Party; they were subjected to certain pressures and squeezes from imperialism and comprador capital. However, their relationship was not one of exploitation and being exploited. The ill-gotten gains that capitalists seized from the laboring people could not be kept by themselves; a portion had to be divided by imperialism and the reactionary Nationalist Party. Yet, China's Khrushchev distorted various exploiters who fought over and divided the labor fruits of workers and peasants into some being exploiters and others being exploited. He shamelessly confused the boundaries between exploitation and being exploited, trying to force capitalists into the ranks of the exploited class.

However, China's Khrushchev did not stop there. He went even further, saying: "Today, the exploitation of capitalists is a matter of profit distribution; in the future, it can be turned into state property through taxation, and the state will exploit the capitalists." This is utterly absurd!

In our proletarian dictatorship state, we use taxation to limit the exploitation of capitalists and take back a portion of their ill-gotten gains into the hands of the proletarian dictatorship state. How can this be called "the state exploiting the capitalists"? China's Khrushchev created this "new theory," which is nothing but a call for the bourgeoisie to rebel against our proletarian dictatorship state! His intentions are evil!

China's Khrushchev not only tries to portray capitalists as having a side that is exploited in both old and new China, but he also completely erases the iron fact that capitalists exploit laborers. In a black directive he gave to his cronies in January 1950, he shamelessly declared: "Hiring refugees to work, buying horses and hiring people to run oil mills is not exploitation; it increases social wealth because this is a society of private ownership." Because it increases social wealth, because it is a society of private ownership, therefore, exploitation is not exploitation—this is the logic of this traitor! According to this logic, there has never been any exploitation in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad; whether it is slave owners or feudal landlords, whether it is Chinese capitalists or the big bosses of Wall Street in the United States, spanning thousands of years and tens of thousands of miles, where can one find an exploiter? If the world has no "exploitation," then what classes are there? What class struggle is there? What revolution is there? China's Khrushchev has thrown Marxism, and the Communist Party, to the winds.

China's Khrushchev is indeed the representative of the Chinese bourgeoisie. At the beginning of liberation, capitalists, in order to cover up their exploitative nature, feared being called "exploiters," so they racked their brains to call themselves "profit sharers." Yet, China's Khrushchev, driven by his class instincts, understood the "plight" of capitalists and jumped out, bare-chested, to say that capitalists hiring workers is not exploitation, portraying capitalists as being exploited in both old and new societies. Thus, he spoke the words that capitalists wanted to say but dared not, playing the role that capitalists wanted to play but could not.

What stance to take towards exploitation, to expose it or cover it up, to oppose it or defend it? This has always been a dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. To deny exploitation is to fundamentally deny classes and class struggle, to fundamentally deny revolution. Chairman Mao taught us as early as 1939: "The thousands of truths of Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' For thousands of years, it has always been said: oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is not justified. Since Marxism came into being, it has overturned this old case. This is a great merit. This truth was obtained by the proletariat through struggle, and Marx drew the conclusion. Based on this truth, thus there is resistance, struggle, and the building of socialism." China's Khrushchev, in this major issue of exploitation, has launched such a frenzied attack on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which, apart from showing that he is a thorough and through traitor to the working class, a die-hard counter-revolutionary who wants to take the capitalist road, what else can it show?

History is merciless. All counter-revolutionary revisionists have never had a good ending, from Bernstein and Kautsky to Khrushchev, it has been the same. Although they once rampaged, they quickly became piles of filth despised by humanity. In the great criticism of the seven hundred million people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, China's Khrushchev will only meet a more disgraceful end than his predecessors.

    资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。马克思
    资本家的忠实辩护士
    一兵
    什么叫做剥削？什么叫做被剥削？这是马克思主义的常识问题。可是，以“老革命”自居的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却竭力混淆剥削和被剥削的界限，美化资产阶级，为发展资本主义作舆论准备。
    一九四九年春，他刚从农村进入城市，就迫不及待地在北京、天津等地，以共产党的“权威人士”的身份出现，一而再、再而三地对资本家宣称：“你们资本家是剥削者同时又是被剥削者；你们剥削工人，但你们又受帝国主义剥削，国民党蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的剥削。”世界上居然还有被剥削的资本家！这是中国的赫鲁晓夫的一大“发现”。
    什么是剥削？用通俗的话说，就是工人、农民的一部分劳动果实被地主资本家霸占了去。很明显，被剥削的是劳动人民。资本家是地地道道的剥削者。在旧中国，民族资产阶级同帝国主义、国民党反动派是有矛盾的，他们是受帝国主义和买办资本的某种压迫和排挤的，但是，他们的关系决不是剥削同被剥削的关系。资本家从劳动人民身上剥削来的赃物，不能自己独吞，要被帝国主义、国民党反动派瓜分去一部分。而中国的赫鲁晓夫，却把争夺和瓜分工人农民的劳动果实的各种剥削者，歪曲成一些是剥削者，另一些是被剥削者。他就是这样无耻地混淆剥削和被剥削的界限，硬要把资本家塞进被剥削者的阶级阵营中来。
    但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫并未到此止步，他更加无耻地说：“今天资本家的剥削是个利润分配问题，今后可以加税又变为国家财产，国家又剥削了资本家。”真是荒谬绝伦！
    我们无产阶级专政的国家，通过税收限制资本家剥削，把他们剥削的一部分赃物收回到无产阶级专政的国家手中，这怎么能叫作“国家又剥削了资本家”？中国的赫鲁晓夫造出了这样的“新理论”，岂不是号召资产阶级起来造我们无产阶级专政国家的反吗？用心何其毒也！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，不仅竭力把资本家打扮成在新旧中国都有被剥削的一面，而且连资本家剥削劳动者这一铁的事实也干脆抹掉。他在一九五○年一月给他的死党的一个黑指示里，连一点点伪装也不要了，他叫嚣说：“雇难民劳动，买马雇人开油坊不叫剥削，它增加了社会财富，因为现在是私有制的社会。”因为增加了社会财富，因为是私有制社会，所以，剥削不是剥削——这就是这个大叛徒的混蛋逻辑！按照这种逻辑，古今中外都说不上有什么剥削；不管是奴隶主还是封建地主，不管是中国的资本家还是美国华尔街的大老板，上下几千年，纵横十万里，到哪里还能找到一个剥削者呢？世界上既然没有什么“剥削”，那还有什么阶级呢？那还有什么阶级斗争，还有什么革命？中国的赫鲁晓夫把马克思主义，把共产党都抛到九霄云外去了。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，的确不愧是中国资产阶级的总代表。解放之初，资本家为了掩盖自己剥削者的面目，怕人家叫他“剥削者”，就绞尽脑汁，自称是什么“利益分润者”。而中国的赫鲁晓夫出于他的阶级本能，很了解资本家的“苦衷”，就自己跳了出来，赤膊上阵，说资本家雇工不算剥削，把资本家说成在新旧社会都是被剥削者。这样，他就说出了资本家想说而不敢说的话，起了资本家想起而起不了的作用。
    对待剥削采取什么立场，是揭露它还是掩盖它，是反对它还是维护它？这从来就是革命同反革命的一个分水岭。否认剥削，就是从根本上否认阶级和阶级斗争，就是从根本上否认革命。毛主席早在一九三九年就教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”中国的赫鲁晓夫，在剥削这个重大问题上如此猖狂地向马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想进攻，这除了说明他是个不折不扣的工人阶级的大叛徒，是个一心要走资本主义道路的老反革命，还能说明什么呢？
    历史是无情的。一切反革命修正主义分子从来都不会有好下场，从伯恩斯坦、考茨基辈直到赫鲁晓夫，无不如此。他们尽管也曾猖狂一时，但很快都变成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。在用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民的大批判中，中国的赫鲁晓夫只会落得个比他的前辈更加可耻的下场。
