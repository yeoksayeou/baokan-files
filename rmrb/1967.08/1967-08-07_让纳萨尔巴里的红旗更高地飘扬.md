The armed revolution of peasants in Naxalbari and other regions of Darjeeling District in India has achieved victory in the first round of their struggle against the reactionary military and police "encirclement and suppression." The first suppression campaign launched by the Indian reactionaries has already failed.

The "non-Congress" government of West Bengal dispatched a large number of military and police forces to attack the revolutionary peasants in the Naxalbari region starting from July 6. However, they were unable to eliminate the peasant armed forces or control the region.

Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, the armed peasant forces in this region bravely and intelligently carried out guerrilla activities. They could launch surprise attacks and could also swiftly retreat when facing superior enemy forces. On July 13, armed peasants attacked a police camp near the reactionary military and police in the Karibari region. On July 19, armed peasants again opened fire on the police at the edge of the Tukuria forest and then calmly withdrew. According to the Indian newspaper *The Statesman* on July 23, the peasant armed forces in Naxalbari "are able to move from one place to another in this area without being affected by police actions." However, this Indian newspaper admitted that the reactionaries were unable to understand this situation and "have not found the answer."

In fact, the answer is very clear. That is, the peasant revolutionary armed forces in Naxalbari have gained the support of the broad masses of peasants. On the contrary, the reactionaries are extremely isolated among the masses. As long as the peasants are fully mobilized, the revolutionary armed forces can completely shatter any "encirclement and suppression" by the reactionary military and police and continue the struggle.

Establishing and expanding peasant armed forces is a primary condition for sustaining the peasant revolutionary struggle. Our great leader Chairman Mao in his brilliant work *Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan* discussed peasant armed forces equipped with spears, saying, "This vast spear force... is a new armed force that makes all local tyrants and evil gentry tremble. The revolutionary authorities in Hunan... should ensure that every young and middle-aged peasant has a spear." Today, in the Naxalbari region of India, there are peasant armed forces equipped with bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons. As long as this "force of bows and arrows" is more widely and extensively established, it can make the landlord forces and reactionary military and police in the countryside tremble with fear. Armed peasants can not only defend their own existence but also seize weapons from the enemy to arm themselves.

Weak peasant armed forces must continuously defeat the enemy's "sweeping" and "encirclement and suppression" and achieve military victories by adhering to flexible guerrilla tactics. Revolutionary peasant armed forces, as long as they skillfully use the "ten-character formula" of "advance when the enemy retreats, harass when the enemy halts, attack when the enemy is tired, and pursue when the enemy retreats," can accumulate their own strength and consume the enemy's fighting force. This is an effective way to sustain long-term armed struggle and achieve victory over the enemy.

To stand firm and sustain long-term armed struggle, revolutionary peasant armed forces must establish and develop rural bases. This is an important task for the current Indian peasant revolution.

The peasant armed forces in Naxalbari have passed the first severe test in their struggle against the reactionary military and police. This living fact shows that revolutionary forces in the countryside have broad room for maneuver and can indeed grow from small to large through struggle.

The Chinese revolution, from its inception, underwent repeated rounds of "encirclement and suppression" and counter-"encirclement and suppression" struggles, endured a long period of struggle, and finally established a powerful people's army and vast rural bases, achieving ultimate victory. The Indian revolution will undoubtedly follow the same path. The revolutionary struggle of the peasants in Naxalbari is long-term and arduous and will inevitably face one round of crushing the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" after another, encountering various difficulties and setbacks. However, as long as the peasant revolutionary armed forces in Naxalbari resolutely follow the path of the Chinese revolution and raise high the red flag of armed struggle, they will definitely push the Indian revolution step by step towards victory.

    让纳萨尔巴里的红旗更高地飘扬
    本报评论员
    印度大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区农民革命武装，在反对印度反动军警“围剿”的斗争中，取得了第一个回合的胜利。印度反动派的第一次镇压行动已经宣告失败。
    西孟加拉邦的“非国大党”政府从七月六日起，派遣大批军警，对纳萨尔巴里地区的革命农民发动了袭击。但是，他们没有办法消灭农民武装，也没有能够控制这个地区。
    印共革命派领导下的农民武装力量，在这个地区勇敢机智地开展了游击活动。他们可以主动出击，也可以在遇到优势敌人的时候，一下子就转移了。七月十三日，武装农民袭击了卡里巴里地区警察营地附近的反动军警。七月十九日，武装农民又在图库里亚森林边缘向警察开火，然后从容不迫地离开。据七月二十三日印度《政治家报》供认，纳萨尔巴里的农民武装“能够在这一地带内从一个地方转移到另一个地方而不受到警察行动的打击”。可是，这家印度报纸说，印度反动派对于这种情况，无法理解，他们“还没有找到答案”。
    其实，答案是非常清楚的。那就是，纳萨尔巴里的农民革命武装，获得广大农民群众的支持。而反动派则相反，在群众中是极端孤立的。只要把农民充分发动起来，革命的武装力量完全能够粉碎反动军警的任何“围剿”，而把斗争坚持下去。
    建立和扩大农民武装力量，这是坚持农民革命斗争的一个首要的条件。我们伟大领袖毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇辉煌的著作中谈到拥有梭镖的农民武装时说，“这个广大的梭镖势力……是使一切土豪劣绅看了打颤的一种新起的武装力量。湖南的革命当局，……应使每个青年壮年农民都有一柄梭镖”。今天，印度纳萨尔巴里地区，就有了拥有弓箭、长矛等土武器的农民武装。只要更普遍、更广泛地建立这种“弓箭和长矛的势力”，就能够使农村中的地主势力和反动军警望而打颤。武装的农民，不仅可以保卫自己的生存，而且可以从敌人那里夺取武器来装备自己。
    尚处于弱小地位的农民武装力量要不断地打败敌人的“扫荡”和“围剿”，取得军事上的胜利，必须坚持机动灵活的游击战术。革命的农民武装只要善于运用“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”这十六字诀，就能够积蓄自己的力量，消耗敌人的有生力量。这是坚持长期武装斗争、克敌制胜的有效办法。
    革命的农民武装要站稳脚跟，要坚持长期的武装斗争，就必须建立和发展农村根据地。这是当前印度农民革命的一个重要任务。
    纳萨尔巴里的农民武装，在同反动军警的斗争中，经受住了第一次严峻的考验。这个活生生的事实表明，革命力量在农村中有着广阔回旋的余地，而且完全能够在斗争中由小到大地发展壮大起来。
    中国的革命，从开始发动起，经过了反复的“围剿”与反“围剿”的斗争的考验，经历了长时期的斗争，才建立了一支强大的人民军队和广大的农村根据地，才取得了最后的胜利。印度的革命也必然是这样。纳萨尔巴里农民的革命斗争，是长期的、艰巨的，还要经历一次又一次粉碎敌人“围剿”的严重的斗争，遇到各种各样的困难和挫折。但是，纳萨尔巴里的农民革命武装只要坚决走中国革命的道路，把武装斗争的红旗高高举起，就一定会推动印度的革命一步一步地走向胜利。
