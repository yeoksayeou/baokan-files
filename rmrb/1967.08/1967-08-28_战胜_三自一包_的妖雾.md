As early as 1962, when we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nangundonggou, were advancing along the path of collectivization and communalization as guided by Chairman Mao, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party stirred up a black wind of "three selfs and one contract" and "four freedoms" nationwide. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party of Pingshan County, following their master's orders, issued instructions: trees and sheep should be distributed to households, private plots should be expanded, mountain rights should be granted to households, community members should cultivate more idle land individually, and even graveyards should be distributed to households for cultivation, and so on. These measures to restore capitalism exactly catered to the psychology of those ghosts and monsters and those with severe spontaneous capitalist tendencies. They became active everywhere, spreading the word:

"Three selfs and one contract this year, and dividing land to households next year." For a time, Nangundonggou was in chaos.

Chairman Mao said: "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, where should China go? Towards capitalism, or towards socialism? ... The facts have already answered this question: only socialism can save China." To emphasize private plots, free markets, and contract production to households, isn't this to restore capitalism? Isn't this to make us retrace our steps? Isn't this to make us poor and lower-middle peasants return to the old society and become beasts of burden again? For this, I couldn't sleep or eat for days and nights. The more I thought about it, the more I felt this wasn't Chairman Mao's instructions; it must be that some bad elements were doing this behind his back. I discussed this with some poor and lower-middle peasant community members and decided not to carry out this "instruction," and to firmly hold the ownership of trees, sheep, and large livestock in the collective's hands. At that time, some cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants were also worried, mainly fearing that they would make the mistake of not listening to the Party and not carrying out Party policies. Later, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and further realized that this was indeed listening to the Party and to Chairman Mao, and it was completely correct. We withstood this black wind.

A handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party of my county hated us for taking the socialist road and slandered us for not carrying out "Party policies," saying that the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nangundonggou were led astray by Li Quanshou. No matter how they attacked us, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nangundonggou were determined to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and not to engage in restoring capitalism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nangundonggou, not only were not blown down by this black wind, but our hearts were more united and our spirits were stronger. The steps of socialist construction in Nangundonggou became bigger and bigger, and the achievements of socialist construction became more and more outstanding. The grain yield per mu quickly broke through the thousand-jin mark. Great Mao Zedong Thought guided us to overcome the "three selfs and one contract" demon fog.

How did we, Nangundonggou, repel the class enemies' repeated attacks and withstand the capitalist black wind stirred up by the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party? It was completely thanks to the great Mao Zedong Thought. All the achievements of Nangundonggou are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can the people of Nangundonggou, in class struggle, defeat all enemies and not be defeated by the enemies; only then can they, in production struggle, overcome all difficulties and create miracles. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and resolutely take the socialist road. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party advocates "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one contract," attempting to restore capitalism in China's rural areas, but we will not agree. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to stink the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

    战胜“三自一包”的妖雾
    全国农业劳动模范、河北平山县南滚龙沟大队党支部书记 李全寿
    早在一九六二年，正当我们南滚龙沟贫下中农沿着毛主席他老人家指引的集体化、公社化道路奋勇前进的时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在全国刮起“三自一包”、“四大自由”的黑风。平山县党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，秉承他们主子的旨意，发出了指示：树木羊群要分到户，自留地要扩大，山权下放到户，社员个人要多搞闲散地，坟地也要分到户耕种，等等。这些复辟资本主义的措施，正迎合了那些牛鬼蛇神和一些资本主义自发倾向严重的人的心理。他们大肆活动起来，到处宣扬说：
  “今年‘三自一包’，明年就是分田到户。”一时把南滚龙沟搞得乌烟瘴气。
    毛主席说：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？……事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”大搞自留地、大搞自由市场、大搞包产到户，这不就是要复辟资本主义吗？这不就是要我们走回头路吗？这不就是叫我们贫下中农重新回到旧社会，当牛做马吗？为这事，我几天几夜睡不着觉，吃不下饭。我越想越觉得这不是毛主席他老人家的指示，一定是坏人背着他老人家搞的这一套。我和一些贫下中农社员反复商量，决定不执行这个“指示”，并把树木、羊群、大牲畜的所有权紧紧掌握在集体手里。这样做，当时有的干部和贫下中农也很担心，主要是怕犯不听党的话、不执行党的政策的错误。后来我们反复学习了毛主席著作，进一步认识到，这样做正是听党的话，听毛主席的话，是完全正确的。我们顶住了这股黑风。
    我县党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派仇恨我们走社会主义道路，污蔑我们不执行“党的政策”，说什么南滚龙沟贫下中农叫李全寿给带坏了。不管他们怎么样的攻击，我们南滚龙沟的贫下中农决心下定了，就是坚决按毛主席的指示办事，不搞复辟资本主义的那一套。我们南滚龙沟的贫下中农，不但没被这股黑风刮倒，相反，全体贫下中农心更齐，劲更大了。南滚龙沟社会主义建设的步子越迈越大，社会主义建设成就越来越突出，粮食亩产量很快闯过了千斤大关。伟大的毛泽东思想引导我们战胜了“三自一包”的妖雾。
    我们南滚龙沟靠什么打退了阶级敌人的一次又一次的进攻，顶住了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派刮起的一股又一股的资本主义黑风？完全靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想。我们南滚龙沟的所有成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。只有依靠毛泽东思想，南滚龙沟的人才能在阶级斗争中，压倒一切敌人而不被敌人所压倒；才能在生产斗争中，排除万难，创造出人间奇迹。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派鼓吹“四大自由”，“三自一包”，妄图在中国农村复辟资本主义，我们坚决不答应。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，不获全胜，决不收兵。
