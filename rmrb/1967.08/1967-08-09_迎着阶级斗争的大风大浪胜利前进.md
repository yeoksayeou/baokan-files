Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," a landmark programmatic document that serves as our guide for the victorious advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Over the past year, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep class sentiments, I have followed the direction indicated by the "Sixteen Points," braved the tumultuous waves of class struggle, undergone trials, tempered myself, and achieved victory.

Awakened by the Study of the "Sixteen Points"

The "Sixteen Points" states: "Since the cultural revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance. This resistance mainly comes from those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and also from the old social forces of habit." In early September of last year, Red Guards from Chairman Mao's side, the "Long Chains Combat Team," arrived in Zigong City to spread the revolutionary wind and ignite the revolutionary fire. They were immediately met with organized and planned attacks from a clique of those within the old Zigong City Committee who were taking the capitalist road. At that time, I did not see through the enemy's plot and participated in this extremely erroneous activity on the night of September 9. During the attack on the revolutionary youngsters, I saw dozens of people surrounding a student, using despicable methods of coercion, extortion, and false accusations to label the revolutionary student as a "counter-revolutionary." At that moment, I thought of the "Sixteen Points," which stipulates: "The focus of this movement is to criticize those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." "To prevent the diversion of the main target of the struggle, it is not allowed to use any pretext to incite the masses to fight the masses, to incite students to fight students, ..." I compared what I saw with the "Sixteen Points" and felt like I had seen a beacon in the dark, initially recognizing that attacking revolutionary students was against the stipulations of the "Sixteen Points." Thus, I had the thought of leaving the scene; but another thought arose: leaving would mean lacking organizational discipline? I was somewhat hesitant, but I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must question everything, think it through carefully, and see if it is practical and reasonable. Absolutely do not follow blindly, and absolutely do not advocate slavishness." After a fierce struggle within myself, I left the scene of the attack on the revolutionary youngsters.

Later, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "Sixteen Points," and related editorials in the People's Daily. I further recognized that the clique within the old Zigong City Committee who were taking the capitalist road suppressed the mass movement and incited the masses to attack students, which was against Mao Zedong Thought and was a mistake in direction and line.

Daring to Be a Rebel Against the Bourgeois Reactionary Line

Recognizing the error of attacking revolutionary youngsters, did I dare to expose this error? My thoughts went through a struggle between "public" and "private." To expose it would mean facing attacks, and others would say I was a "traitor." Not to expose it would mean how to deal with the "Sixteen Points"?

Following the large-scale attack on students on September 9, similar serious incidents occurred on September 10 and 11. Seeing these continued violations of the "Sixteen Points," I could no longer bear it. Let them attack! On September 12, I resolutely wrote a big-character poster with what I knew and my understanding, and posted it on the streets of Zigong City. The title was: "This is a Mistake in Direction, a Mistake in Line." As soon as the big-character poster was posted, many people came to see it. Revolutionary youngsters applauded and cheered! Some people, after reading the poster, flew into a rage and cursed all sorts of things. Why was the reaction to this poster so strong and so different?

The clique within the old City Committee who were taking the capitalist road hated this poster to death and feared it to death. They attempted to "shoot the bird that sticks its head out." The next day, under their command, various slogans, banners, and big-character posters attacking me were plastered all over the streets. Every word that could destroy a revolutionary comrade's political life was used. On the same day, the Commercial Bureau's misled masses besieged me for a whole day. They were numerous and powerful, but I relied on the "Sixteen Points" to engage in a point-for-point struggle against their slander and insults.

They accused me of leaking party secrets. I responded to them: The clique within the old City Committee who were taking the capitalist road did not act according to the "Sixteen Points" and diverted the main direction of the struggle. This "secret," I must "leak," and the faster the better.

They cursed me as a "fake leftist, true rightist." I refuted: Some "activists" in the cultural revolution of the municipal organs were appointed by the work team. Such "leftists" are serving the clique within the old City Committee who were taking the capitalist road, and indeed are fake leftists. Being such a "leftist" is not glorious; it is shameful.

They slandered me as a "traitor." I believe that to return from the bourgeois reactionary line to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must go through a process of betrayal. Not betraying the bourgeois reactionary line means one cannot return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In this sense of betraying the reactionary line, it is glorious!

In the point-for-point struggle, they also defended the clique within the old City Committee who were taking the capitalist road. For example: "It was not an organized and planned incitement of the masses to fight students!" "It was a normal debate, not an attack!" "The main direction of the struggle was not diverted!" and so on. I refuted them one by one, using a large amount of evidence to prove that they were organized, planned, and conspiratorial, that it was an attack, not a debate, and that they had completely diverted the main direction of the struggle.

Resisting the Infiltration of Bourgeois Thought

A clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road are very cunning. They knew that force would not work, so they tried soft tactics, attempting to use "soft and hard combined" to make me surrender. One day, they sent someone to talk to me privately, feigning concern: "You are a mother of three children. Your husband is a military officer. You used to listen to the Party, but why are you doing this now? What good does it do for you?"

The enemy's move was indeed powerful! After the talk, my mind was in a fierce struggle between "public" and "private." They labeled me as a "counter-revolutionary." If I alone were labeled a "counter-revolutionary," it would not matter, but it would implicate my husband and my children, and their future and reputation would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, I became a bit frightened. When I returned home, I told my husband about my thoughts. His attitude was very clear: he thought I did the right thing and had not made a mistake. To defend the interests of the Party and the people, to defend the "Sixteen Points" personally directed by Chairman Mao, one must act this way! He and I studied Chairman Mao's quotations together. Chairman Mao said: "A Communist Party member should... regard revolutionary interests as his first life, subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests; at all times and in all places, adhere to correct principles and engage in tireless struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors,... regard the interests of the Party and the masses as more important than personal interests, and regard the interests of others as more important than one's own. Only then can one be considered a Communist Party member."

Chairman Mao's teachings gave me great encouragement and strength, and also made me recognize the enemy's plot, which was to intimidate me, use bourgeois individualism to infiltrate me, make me forget the public for the private, give up halfway, dare not revolt, dare not rebel, and retreat into the small family of individualism. I must not fall for the class enemy's trick; I must struggle to the end and rebel to the end. I opened the "Sixteen Points" personally directed by Chairman Mao, which states: "Be alert to those who label revolutionary masses as 'counter-revolutionaries'." "They do this and will inevitably strike at some truly revolutionary activists. This is a mistake in direction, a mistake in line, and it is absolutely not allowed to do this." With Chairman Mao backing us, what do I have to fear? I wrote several more big-character posters, using revolutionary actions to counter the class enemy's threats.

After these posters were posted, they caused even greater panic and hatred among a clique within the Commercial Bureau. The head of the Cultural Revolution Group in the Commercial Bureau even announced: "Bar Hu Yufang from posting big-character posters on the streets."

They did not allow me to post big-character posters on the streets, so I would not post them on the streets? I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, to have the spirit of "daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse," regardless of how they regulated, I had only one thought: to revolt! To rebel against those within the Party who were taking the capitalist road! Thus, I wrote several more big-character posters and posted each one on the streets.

My revolutionary actions were warmly welcomed and supported by many revolutionary youngsters. However, a clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road were not willing to admit defeat, and their persecution of me became even more vicious. They not only restricted my freedom but also used extremely despicable methods, fabricating history and slandering me, attempting to use the influence of the bourgeois reactionary bloodline theory among the masses to harm me and isolate me. Big-character posters titled "Expose Hu Yufang's True Colors" were plastered all over the streets.

To smash the class enemy's plot, I wrote another big-character poster titled "My Family History," criticizing the bourgeois reactionary bloodline theory. After this poster was posted, more and more people came forward to support me.

Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line!

To press the advantage, on September 29, I wrote two more big-character posters, continuing to expose the crimes of the head of the Cultural Revolution Small Group in the Commercial Bureau inciting the cadres of the Commercial Bureau to repeatedly attack revolutionary youngsters and persecute me.

Soon after these two posters were posted, the editorial "Advancing on the Road of Mao Zedong Thought" from the 13th issue of the Red Flag magazine in 1966 was published. After reading this editorial, I was so moved that I shed tears. Chairman Mao knew my situation, the Party Central Committee knew my situation, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee were backing us revolutionaries! This editorial pointed out sharply: "Whether or not to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line is the key to whether or not the 'Sixteen Points' of the cultural revolution can be implemented and whether or not the broad struggle-criticism-transformation can be correctly carried out. Here, compromise cannot be adopted." Based on the spirit of this editorial, I engaged in struggle with them. After the editorial "The Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionary Line Represented by Chairman Mao" from the 14th issue of the Red Flag magazine in 1966 was published, I was even happier and almost jumped for joy! Some of the misled masses began to awaken, and some turned against their former allies. Soon, I went from being one person to being thirteen people, and we formed a fighting collective called the "Dawn Combat Team." Together with the broad proletarian revolutionary masses, under the guidance of the "Sixteen Points" personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao, we advanced from one victory to another!

To consolidate this victory and develop this victory, we proletarian revolutionaries resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, concentrate our firepower on the greatest clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and their agents in Sichuan Province and Zigong City, launching a fierce attack. We must thoroughly seize their power politically, ideologically, and organizationally and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪胜利前进
    胡雨芳
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，是一个划时代的纲领性文件，是我们胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的指针。一年来，我怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和深厚的阶级感情，按照“十六条”指引的方向，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪前进，经受了考验，得到了锻炼，取得了胜利。
    从学习“十六条”中觉醒过来
    “十六条”指出：“文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。这种阻力，主要来自那些混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，同时也来自旧的社会习惯势力。”去年九月上旬，来自毛主席身边的红卫兵小将——“长缨战斗队”刚到自贡市煽革命之风，点革命之火，就立即遭到旧自贡市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派策划的有组织有计划的围攻。那时，我没有识破敌人的阴谋，在九月九日晚上也参加了这种极端错误的活动。在围攻革命小将的过程中，我看到几十个人围攻一个学生，并采取逼、供、信等卑劣手法，把革命学生打成“反革命”。当时，我想到“十六条”规定：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”“为了防止转移斗争的主要目标，不许用任何借口，去挑动群众斗争群众，挑动学生斗争学生，……”。我把看到的情况和“十六条”一对照，就象黑夜中看见了一盏明灯，初步认识到围攻革命学生，是违背“十六条”规定的。于是，我产生了离开那个现场的念头；但另一个念头又出现了：离开是不是没有组织纪律性？开始我有些犹豫不决，但记起毛主席的教导：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”经过激烈的思想斗争，我离开了围攻革命小将的现场。
    事后，我又反复学习了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》两篇光辉著作、“十六条”和《人民日报》有关社论，进一步认识到旧自贡市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派压制群众运动，挑动群众斗学生，是违背毛泽东思想的，犯了方向、路线的错误。
    敢作资产阶级反动路线的叛逆者
    认识到了围攻革命小将的错误，敢不敢揭露这个错误？我思想上经历了一个“公”和“私”的斗争过程。揭露吧，就可能受围攻，别人就会说你是“叛徒”。不揭露吧，究竟怎样来对待“十六条”呢？
    继九月九日发生了大规模围攻学生的事件，九月十日、十一日，又连续发生了围攻学生的严重事件。我看见这些继续违反“十六条”的行为，实在熬不住了。要围攻就围攻吧！九月十二日，我毅然决然把我知道的情况和我的认识，写成了一张大字报，贴到自贡市大街上。题目是：《这是方向的错误，路线的错误》。大字报刚一贴出，看的人很多。革命小将们拍手叫好！一面看，一面抄。也有的人，看了大字报后，暴跳如雷，什么怪话都骂出来了。一张大字报，为什么反应这么强烈，这么不同呢？
    对这张大字报，旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，恨得要死，怕得要命。他们妄图“枪打出头鸟”。第二天，在他们的指挥下，各种各样攻击我的标语、口号、大字报，贴满了大街小巷。凡是能够毁灭一个革命同志政治生命的字眼，通通用上了。也就在这一天，商业局受蒙蔽的群众围攻了我一整天。他们人多势众，我就依靠一本“十六条”，同他们的诬蔑谩骂进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    他们攻击我泄露了党的机密。我就回答他们：旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不按“十六条”办事，转移了斗争大方向。这种“密”，我就是要“泄”，泄露得越快越好。
    他们骂我是“假左派、真右派”。我就驳斥：市级机关文化大革命中的一些“积极分子”，是工作组封的。这样的“左派”是为旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派服务的“左派”，的确是假左派。当这种“左派”不是光荣，是耻辱。
    他们诬蔑我是“叛徒”。我认为从资产阶级反动路线，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，必须有个背叛的过程。不背叛资产阶级反动路线，就无法回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。从背叛反动路线这个意义上讲，这是光荣！
    在针锋相对的斗争中，他们也为旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了辩护。比如说：不是有组织有计划挑动群众斗学生呀！是正常的辩论不是围攻呀！没有转移斗争的大方向呀！等等。我也一一进行了驳斥，用大量的事实证明他们一小撮人是有组织有计划有阴谋的，是围攻，不是什么辩论，完全转移了斗争的大方向。
    顶住资产阶级思想的侵蚀
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是非常狡猾的。他们知道硬的不行，又来软的，妄图“软硬兼施”，使我屈服。一天，他们派人找我个别谈话，假心假意地对我说：你是三个孩子的母亲了。你爱人是解放军的干部。你过去听党的话，现在为什么要这样作哟，对你有啥子好处哟？
    敌人这一手，可是厉害！谈话后，我脑子里就激烈地展开了“公”和“私”的斗争。他们把我打成“反革命”，我一个人当“反革命”没有关系，但会连累自己的爱人，自己的孩子，他们的前途和声誉都会是不堪设想的。想到这些，我就有些害怕。回到家里，我把自己的想法告诉了我的爱人。他的态度非常鲜明，认为我做得对，没有错。为了维护党和人民的利益，为了捍卫毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，就应当这样做！他和我一起学习毛主席语录。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该……以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，……关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”
    毛主席的教导，给了我极大的鼓舞和力量，同时也使我认识到敌人的阴谋，是妄图吓唬我，用资产阶级个人主义思想侵蚀我，使我私而忘公，半途而废，不敢革命，不敢造反，龟缩在个人主义的小家庭里。我绝不能上阶级敌人的当，一定要斗争到底，造反到底。我又翻开毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，其中指出：“警惕有人把革命群众打成‘反革命’”。“他们这样做，必然要打击到一些真正革命的积极分子。这是方向的错误，路线的错误，决不允许这样做。”有毛主席给我们撑腰，我还怕什么呢！我又接连写出了几张大字报，用革命的行动来回击阶级敌人的恐吓。
    这些大字报贴出后，引起商业局一小撮人的更大恐慌和仇恨。商业局文革组长竟然宣布：不准胡雨芳再上街贴大字报。
    他们不准我再上街贴大字报，我就不上街贴大字报了吗？我牢牢记住毛主席的教导，要有“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的精神，管他这样规定、那样规定，我就只有一个想法：要革命！要造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反！于是，我又连续写了几张大字报，而且每张大字报都贴到大街上去了。
    我的革命行动，受到了许许多多革命小将的热烈欢迎和支持。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决不甘心失败，他们对我的迫害更加变本加厉了。他们不但限制了我的自由，而且采取非常卑劣的手法，捏造历史，造谣诽谤我，妄图利用资产阶级反动血统论在群众中的影响，来陷害我，孤立我。“揭穿胡雨芳的画皮”的大字报贴满了大街小巷。
    为了粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋，我又写了一张“我的家史”的大字报，批判资产阶级反动血统论。这张大字报贴出后，不断有更多的人站出来支持我。
    毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    为了乘胜追击，九月二十九日，我又写出了两张大字报，继续揭露商业局文革小组组长煽动商业局的干部，不断围攻革命小将和迫害我的罪恶事实。
    这两张大字报贴出不久，《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十三期社论《在毛泽东思想的大路上前进》发表了。我读完了这篇社论，激动得流出了眼泪。我的情况，毛主席知道了，党中央知道了，毛主席、党中央为我们革命造反派撑腰！这篇社论，一针见血地指出：“要不要批判资产阶级反动路线，是能不能贯彻执行文化革命的十六条，能不能正确进行广泛的斗批改的关键。在这里，不能采取折衷主义。”我根据这篇社论的精神和他们进行了斗争。《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十四期社论《以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利》发表后，我更高兴得几乎跳了起来！一些受蒙蔽的群众，纷纷开始觉醒，有的反戈一击。不久，我就由一个人变成了十三个人，而且有了一个战斗的集体，叫“曙光战斗队”。我们同广大的无产阶级革命派一起，在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”的指引下，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利！
    为了巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利，我们无产阶级革命派坚决遵照毛主席的伟大战略部署，集中火力向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在四川省、自贡市的代理人，发起猛烈进攻。我们一定要从政治上、思想上、组织上彻底夺他们的权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
