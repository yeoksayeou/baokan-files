In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable.

War—since the advent of private property and class distinctions, it has been the highest form of struggle to resolve contradictions between classes, nations, states, and political groups at a certain stage of development.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 164.

In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without them, the leap in social development cannot be achieved, the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain power.

From "On Contradiction" (August 1937), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 322.

Historically, wars can be divided into two categories: just wars and unjust wars. All progressive wars are just, and all wars that hinder progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that hinder progress, but we do not oppose just, progressive wars. For the latter category of wars, we Communists not only do not oppose them but actively participate in them.

From "On Protracted War" (May 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 465.

War—this monster of mutual slaughter in human society—will ultimately be eliminated by the development of human society, and it will be eliminated in the not-too-distant future. However, the method to eliminate it is only one: to use war to oppose war, to use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war, to use national revolutionary war to oppose national counter-revolutionary war, and to use class revolutionary war to oppose class counter-revolutionary war.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 167.

Power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad.

From "Problems of War and Strategy" (November 6, 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 529.

Every Communist must understand this truth: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

From "Problems of War and Strategy" (November 6, 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 535.

From the standpoint of Marxist views on the state, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize and maintain state power must have a powerful army. Some people laugh at us for being "militarists," but yes, we are advocates of revolutionary war, and this is not bad but good, it is Marxist. The Russian Communists' guns created a socialist society. We want to create a democratic republic. The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the entire world can only be transformed through the gun.

From "Problems of War and Strategy" (November 6, 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 535.

In China, without armed struggle, there would be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory. For eighteen years, the development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our Party have been carried out in revolutionary war. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today. This experience bought with blood, all Party comrades must not forget.

From "Foreword to the Publication of 'Communist'" (October 4, 1939), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, pages 600-601.

All reactionaries are paper tigers.

All reactionaries are paper tigers. They may look terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people.

From "Talk with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" (August 1946), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, page 1193.

Like all things in the world, imperialism and all reactionaries have two aspects (i.e., the law of unity of opposites). They are both real tigers and paper tigers. Historically, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class, and the bourgeoisie were vigorous, revolutionary, and progressive before they seized power and for a period after they seized power. In the subsequent period, due to the growth and struggle of their opposites—the slave class, the peasant class, and the proletariat—they gradually transformed into reactionaries, into backward people, into paper tigers, and ultimately were or will be overthrown by the people. Reactionary, backward, and decadent classes, when facing the people's life-and-death struggle, also have this two-sided nature. On one hand, they are real tigers, eating people, eating hundreds of thousands or millions of people. The people's cause of struggle is in a difficult and arduous period, and many winding roads appear. The Chinese people, to eliminate the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, spent over a hundred years and lost several thousand people, before achieving victory in 1949. Look, isn't this a real tiger, an iron tiger, a true tiger? But ultimately, they turned into paper tigers, dead tigers, tofu tigers. This is a historical fact. Haven't people seen and heard of these things? Thousands upon thousands! Thousands upon thousands! Therefore, essentially, strategically, and in the long term, we must realistically see imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers. From this point, we establish our strategic thinking. On the other hand, they are also living, iron, real tigers, and they will eat people. From this point, we establish our tactical and strategic thinking.

From the instructions at the Wuhan meeting of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau (December 1, 1958), see the preface to "Talk with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong," *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, page 1190.

Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say "imperialism is very ferocious," we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher's knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their destruction.

Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people, and they will not deviate from this logic. This is another Marxist law. The Russian people's revolution followed this law, and the Chinese people's revolution also followed this law.

From "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" (August 14, 1949), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, pages 1490-1491.

People of the world, unite! Defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! People of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All demons will be destroyed.

From "Statement Supporting the Congolese (Leopoldville) People's Struggle Against American Aggression" (November 28, 1964), *People of the World, Unite and Defeat the American Aggressors and All Their Running Dogs*, People's Publishing House, page 14.

The decisive factor in the outcome of war is people, not things.

Only the people are the motive force in the creation of world history.

From "On the Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 3, page 1031.

Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of human strength and human hearts. Military and economic strength must be grasped by people.

From "On Protracted War" (May 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 459.

The profound source of the great power of war lies in the masses. The reason Japan dares to bully us is mainly due to the disorganized state of the Chinese people. Overcoming this weakness will place the Japanese invaders before tens of millions of our people who have stood up, making them like a wild cow charging into a fire. We just need to shout, and they will be scared to death. This wild cow will inevitably be burned to death.

From "On Protracted War" (May 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 501.

Take China as an example. What we rely on is nothing but rice and rifles, but history will ultimately prove that this rice and rifles are stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes and tanks. Although there are still many difficulties in front of the Chinese people, the Chinese people will suffer long-term hardships under the combined attack of American imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries, but these reactionaries will eventually fail, and we will eventually win. The reason is not that they represent reaction, while we represent progress.

From "Talk with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" (August 1946), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, page 1193.

Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged.

From "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods" (January 27, 1934), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 131.

What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries. Around the revolutionary government, rallying millions of people, developing our revolutionary war, we can annihilate all counter-revolutionaries and seize all of China.

From "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods" (January 27, 1934), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 134.

The people's guerrilla warfare, from the perspective of the entire revolutionary war, is the left and right hands of the main force Red Army. Without the people's guerrilla warfare in addition to the main force Red Army, it is like a one-armed general.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 221.

This army is powerful because it has a broad mass armed organization, the People's Self-Defense Corps and the Militia, fighting alongside it. In the liberated areas of China, all young and strong men and women, on a voluntary, democratic, and non-detachment-from-production basis, are organized into the Anti-Japanese People's Self-Defense Corps. The elite members of the Self-Defense Corps, in addition to those who join the army and guerrilla units, are organized into the Militia. Without the cooperation of these mass armed forces, it is impossible to defeat the enemy.

From "On the Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 3, page 1040.

This army is powerful because it divides itself into main force units and local units. The former can execute supra-local combat missions at any time, while the latter's mission is fixed in cooperating with the Militia and Self-Defense Corps to defend the local area and attack local enemies. This division has gained the genuine support of the people. If there were no such correct division, for example, if only the main force units were emphasized and the local units were neglected, then, under the conditions of the Chinese liberated areas, it would also be impossible to defeat the enemy. In the local units, many well-trained armed work teams, which are relatively more robust in military, political, and mass work, have been organized. They have penetrated deep into the enemy's rear, striking the enemy and mobilizing the masses' anti-Japanese struggle, thereby effectively supporting the frontline operations of each liberated area. This has achieved great results.

From "On the Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 3, pages 1040-1041.

Imperialists bully us like this; this needs to be seriously dealt with. We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish many militia regiments. In this way, when imperialists invade our country, they will find it difficult to move.

From a talk with Xinhua News Agency reporters (September 29, 1958), *People's Daily*, October 1, 1958.

Establish rural base areas, use the countryside to surround the cities.

The armed struggle of the Chinese Communist Party is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat.

From "Foreword to the Publication of 'Communist'" (October 4, 1939), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 600.

The Anti-Japanese War is essentially a peasant war.

From "On New Democracy" (January 1940), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 685.

Because powerful imperialism and its reactionary allies in China always occupy the central cities of China for a long time, if the revolutionary forces do not want to compromise with imperialism and its running dogs but insist on fighting on, if the revolutionary forces want to accumulate and temper their strength and avoid decisive battles with powerful enemies when their strength is not sufficient, then they must turn backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated base areas, into great revolutionary strongholds in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. This is to counter the vicious enemies who use cities to attack rural areas, to gradually achieve complete victory in the long-term struggle.

From "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" (December 1939), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 629.

What is the base area for guerrilla warfare? It is the strategic base for guerrilla warfare to execute its strategic tasks and achieve the goals of preserving and developing itself and annihilating and driving away the enemy. Without such a strategic base, the execution of all strategic tasks and the realization of war goals would lose their support.

From "Problems of Strategy in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare" (May 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 409.

The long-term revolutionary struggle carried out in such revolutionary base areas is mainly peasant guerrilla warfare under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it is incorrect to neglect the view of using rural areas as revolutionary base areas, to neglect the view of doing hard work among the peasants, and to neglect the view of guerrilla warfare.

From "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" (December 1939), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 630.

Emphasizing work in rural base areas does not mean that work in cities and other vast rural areas under enemy control can be abandoned. On the contrary, without work in cities and other rural areas, the rural base areas would be isolated, and the revolution would fail. Moreover, the ultimate goal of the revolution is to seize the cities, which are the main base areas of the enemy. Without sufficient work in cities, this goal cannot be achieved.

From "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" (December 1939), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 630.

From 1927 to now, our work focus has been in the countryside, gathering strength in the countryside, using the countryside to surround the cities, and then seizing the cities.

From "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" (March 5, 1949), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, page 1428.

The People's Liberation Army is a armed group that executes revolutionary political tasks.

Without a people's army, there is nothing.

From "On the Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 3, page 1074.

Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never command the Party.

From "Problems of War and Strategy" (November 6, 1938), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 535.

This army is powerful because all those who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they fight not for the private interests of a few or a narrow group but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and the interests of the entire nation. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army.

From "On the Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 3, page 1039.

The Chinese Red Army is an armed group that executes revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just fighting; in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also bears the heavy tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary governments, and even building Communist Party organizations. The Red Army's fighting is not just for fighting but for propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses to build revolutionary governments. Without these goals, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its meaning.

From "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas within the Party" (December 1929), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 88.

The Eighth Route Army has something extremely important and prominent, which is its political work. The basic principles of the Eighth Route Army's political work are three: first, the principle of officer-soldier unity, which is to eliminate feudalism in the army, abolish the beating and scolding system, establish conscious discipline, practice sharing joys and sorrows, and thus the whole army is united. Second, the principle of military-civilian unity, which is to maintain strict discipline among the people, propagate, organize, and arm the people, reduce the people's economic burden, and strike traitors and sellouts. Therefore, the military and the people are united, and everywhere they are welcomed by the people. Third, the principle of dissolving the enemy and treating prisoners of war leniently. Our victory depends not only on our army's fighting but also on the dissolution of the enemy's army.

From "Talk with British Journalist Bertrand" (October 25, 1937), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 2, page 369.

The People's Liberation Army will always be a combat force. Even after national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialist systems exist internationally, our army is still a combat force. There must be no misunderstanding or wavering about this point.

From "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" (March 5, 1949), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, page 1427.

The People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school should learn politics, military affairs, culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production, and operate some small and medium-sized factories to produce some of the products needed by the army and products for equal exchange with the state. This great school should also engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and rural areas; after the socialist education movement is completed, there is always mass work to be done, so that the military and the people are always united as one. It should also participate in the cultural revolution struggle to criticize bourgeois culture at any time. In this way, military, agriculture, industry, and the people can be combined. Of course, there should be appropriate adjustments, with main and subsidiary aspects. Agriculture, industry, and the people, a unit can only combine one or two items, not all at the same time. In this way, the role of several million troops will be very great.

From a letter to Comrade Lin Biao, excerpted from the editorial of *People's Daily*, August 1, 1966: "The Whole Country Should Become a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought."

The strategic and tactical principles of people's war.

You fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat.

Quoted from Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" (September 1965), People's Publishing House, pages 28-29.

[Appendix]

Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the strategic and tactical principles of people's war in four sentences: You fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat.

This means: you rely on modern weapons, I rely on the highly conscious people's masses; you exploit your advantages, I exploit my advantages; you have your way of fighting, I have my way of fighting. When you attack me, you can't hit me or catch me. When I attack you, I will hit you and hit you accurately, and eat you up. When I can eat you up, I will eat you up; when I can't eat you up, I won't let you eat me up. Fighting when you can win is opportunism, fighting when you can't win is adventurism. All our strategic and tactical principles are based on this fundamental point of fighting. We admit that it is necessary to retreat, but it is on the condition that it is necessary to fight. All retreats are for fighting, for the ultimate and thorough annihilation of the enemy. Such strategic and tactical principles can only be carried out by relying on the broad masses of the people. By carrying out such strategic and tactical principles, the superiority of people's war can be fully brought into play. No matter what technical advantages the enemy has, no matter what methods the enemy uses to deal with us, it can only be in a passive position of being beaten, and the initiative will always be in our hands.

From Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" (September 1965), People's Publishing House, pages 28-29.

Our strategy is to "fight ten with one," and our tactics are to "fight one with ten." This is one of the fundamental principles of our victory over the enemy.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 220.

Our tactics are guerrilla tactics. In general, they are: "Divide forces to mobilize the masses, concentrate forces to deal with the enemy." "When the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy halts, we harass; when the enemy is tired, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue." "Fixed area guerrilla warfare, using a wave-like advance policy. When a strong enemy pursues, use a swirling encirclement policy." "In a short time, with good methods, mobilize a large number of people." This tactic is like casting a net, which needs to be opened and closed at the right time. Open to attract the masses, close to deal with the enemy.

From "Spark Will Kindle a Prairie Fire" (January 5, 1930), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 107.

Our military principles are: (1) First attack dispersed and isolated enemies, then attack concentrated and powerful enemies. (2) First seize small cities, medium-sized cities, and vast rural areas, then seize large cities. (3) The main goal is to annihilate the enemy's effective forces, not to conserve or seize cities and places. Conserving or seizing cities and places is the result of annihilating the enemy's effective forces and often requires repeated efforts to finally conserve or seize them. (4) In each battle, concentrate absolutely superior forces (two, three, four times, sometimes even five or six times the enemy's forces), surround the enemy on all sides, strive for complete annihilation, and do not let any escape. In special circumstances, use the method of giving the enemy a crushing blow, that is, concentrate all forces to attack the enemy's front and one or both flanks, aiming to annihilate part of the enemy and rout the other part, so that our army can quickly transfer forces to annihilate other enemy forces. Avoid battles that are not worth the effort or are evenly matched. In this way, overall, we are inferior (in terms of quantity), but in each specific battle, we have absolute superiority, which guarantees the victory of the battle. With the passage of time, we will turn into a superior force overall until we annihilate all enemies. (5) Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without confidence, and in each battle, strive to be prepared and have the confidence to win under the comparison of enemy and friendly conditions. (6) Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest). (7) Strive to annihilate the enemy in motion. At the same time, pay attention to positional attack tactics to seize the enemy's strongholds and cities. (8) For all enemy strongholds and cities with weak defenses, seize them decisively. For all enemy strongholds and cities with moderate defenses and conditions allowing seizure, seize them as appropriate. For all enemy strongholds and cities with strong defenses, wait until conditions are ripe before seizing them. (9) Capture all the enemy's weapons and most of their personnel to supplement ourselves. The main source of our manpower and material is on the front line. (10) Make good use of the intervals between two battles to rest and train the troops. The rest period should generally not be too long and should not give the enemy a chance to breathe. The above are the main methods by which the People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek. These methods were produced in the long-term combat with domestic and foreign enemies and are completely suitable for our current situation. Our strategic and tactical principles are based on people's war. Any anti-people army cannot use our strategic and tactical principles.

From "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" (December 25, 1947), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 4, pages 1247-1248.

Learn war from war—this is our main method.

The laws of war—this is a problem that anyone who directs war cannot avoid studying and solving.

The laws of revolutionary war—this is a problem that anyone who directs revolutionary war cannot avoid studying and solving.

The laws of China's revolutionary war—this is a problem that anyone who directs China's revolutionary war cannot avoid studying and solving.

We are now engaged in war, our war is a revolutionary war, and our revolutionary war is carried out in this semi-colonial and semi-feudal country of China. Therefore, we not only need to study the general laws of war but also need to study the special laws of revolutionary war and need to study the even more special laws of China's revolutionary war.

Everyone knows that no matter what you do, if you do not understand the situation of that thing, its nature, and its relationship with things outside of it, you will not know the laws of that thing, you will not know how to do it, and you will not be able to do it well.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, pages 163-164.

The correct deployment of the commander comes from the correct decision, the correct decision comes from the correct judgment, the correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance, and from the interconnected thinking of various reconnaissance materials. The commander uses all possible and necessary reconnaissance means to refine the materials obtained from reconnaissance, to distinguish truth from falsehood, to think from one thing to another, and from the surface to the inside. Then, add our own situation to it, study the comparison and mutual relationship of both sides, and thus form a judgment, make a decision, and make a plan—this is the whole process of recognizing the situation before making each strategic, campaign, or battle plan.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 173.

The outcome of war is mainly determined by the military, political, economic, and natural conditions of the two sides fighting, which is undeniable. However, it is not only that; it is also determined by the subjective leadership ability of the two sides. Military commanders cannot exceed the range allowed by material conditions to seek victory in war, but military commanders can and must strive for victory within the range allowed by material conditions. The stage for military commanders' activities is built on objective material conditions, but military commanders, relying on this stage, can stage many colorful and magnificent live performances.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 175.

Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning. Learn war from war—this is our main method. Those who have no opportunity to go to school can still learn war, that is, learn from war. Revolutionary war is a matter for the masses, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning.

From "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 174.

    毛主席论人民战争
    在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的
    战争——从有私有财产和有阶级以来就开始了的、用以解决阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家、政治集团和政治集团之间、在一定发展阶段上的矛盾的一种最高的斗争形式。
    《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一六四页
    在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。
    《矛盾论》（一九三七年八月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第三二二页
    历史上的战争分为两类，一类是正义的，一类是非正义的。一切进步的战争都是正义的，一切阻碍进步的战争都是非正义的。我们共产党人反对一切阻碍进步的非正义的战争，但是不反对进步的正义的战争。对于后一类战争，我们共产党人不但不反对，而且积极地参加。
    《论持久战》（一九三八年五月），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第四六五页
    战争——这个人类互相残杀的怪物，人类社会的发展终久要把它消灭的，而且就在不远的将来会要把它消灭的。但是消灭它的方法只有一个，就是用战争反对战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争，用阶级革命战争反对阶级反革命战争。
    《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一六七页
    枪杆子里面出政权
    革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。
    《战争和战略问题》（一九三八年十一月六日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五二九页
    每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：“枪杆子里面出政权”。
    《战争和战略问题》（一九三八年十一月六日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五三五页
    从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。有人笑我们是“战争万能论”，对，我们是革命战争万能论者，这不是坏的，是好的，是马克思主义的。俄国共产党的枪杆子造了一个社会主义。我们要造一个民主共和国。帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。
    《战争和战略问题》（一九三八年十一月六日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五三五页
    在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。十八年来，我们党的发展、巩固和布尔塞维克化，是在革命战争中进行的，没有武装斗争，就不会有今天的共产党。这个拿血换来的经验，全党同志都不要忘记。
    《〈共产党人〉发刊词》（一九三九年十月四日），《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六○○——六○一页
    帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。
     《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》（一九四六年八月），《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一九三页
    同世界上一切事物无不具有两重性（即对立统一规律）一样，帝国主义和一切反动派也有两重性，它们是真老虎又是纸老虎。历史上奴隶主阶级、封建地主阶级和资产阶级，在它们取得统治权力以前和取得统治权力以后的一段时间内，它们是生气勃勃的，是革命者，是先进者，是真老虎。在随后的一段时间，由于它们的对立面，奴隶阶级、农民阶级和无产阶级，逐步壮大，并同它们进行斗争，越来越厉害，它们就逐步向反面转化，化为反动派，化为落后的人们，化为纸老虎，终究被或者将被人民所推翻。反动的、落后的、腐朽的阶级，在面临人民的决死斗争的时候，也还有这样的两重性。一面，真老虎，吃人，成百万人成千万人地吃。人民斗争事业处在艰难困苦的时代，出现许多弯弯曲曲的道路。中国人民为了消灭帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，花了一百多年时间，死了大概几千万人之多，才取得一九四九年的胜利。你看，这不是活老虎，铁老虎，真老虎吗？但是，它们终究转化成了纸老虎，死老虎，豆腐老虎。这是历史的事实。人们难道没有看见听见过这些吗？真是成千成万！成千成万！所以，从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派，都看成纸老虎。从这点上，建立我们的战略思想。另一方面，它们又是活的铁的真的老虎，它们会吃人的。从这点上，建立我们的策略思想和战术思想。

    捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。我们说“帝国主义是很凶恶的”，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。
    斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。俄国人民的革命曾经是依照了这条定律，中国人民的革命也是依照这条定律。

    战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。日本敢于欺负我们，主要的原因在于中国民众的无组织状态。克服了这一缺点，就把日本侵略者置于我们数万万站起来了的人民之前，使它象一匹野牛冲入火阵，我们一声唤也要把它吓一大跳，这匹野牛就非烧死不可。

    拿中国的情形来说，我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。虽然在中国人民面前还存在着许多困难，中国人民在美国帝国主义和中国反动派的联合进攻之下，将要受到长时间的苦难，但是这些反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。

    这个军队之所以有力量，还由于有人民自卫军和民兵这样广大的群众武装组织，和它一道配合作战。在中国解放区内，一切青年、壮年的男人和女人，都在自愿的民主的和不脱离生产的原则下，组织在抗日人民自卫军之中。自卫军中的精干分子，除加入军队和游击队者外，则组织在民兵的队伍中。没有这些群众武装力量的配合，要战胜敌人是不可能的。
     《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日），《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○四○页
    这个军队之所以有力量，还由于它将自己划分为主力兵团和地方兵团两部分，前者可以随时执行超地方的作战任务，后者的任务则固定在协同民兵、自卫军保卫地方和进攻当地敌人方面。这种划分，取得了人民的真心拥护。如果没有这种正确的划分，例如说，如果只注意主力兵团的作用，忽视地方兵团的作用，那末，在中国解放区的条件下，要战胜敌人也是不可能的。在地方兵团方面，组织了许多经过良好训练，在军事、政治、民运各项工作上说来都是比较地更健全的武装工作队，深入敌后之敌后，打击敌人，发动民众的抗日斗争，借以配合各个解放区正面战线的作战，收到了很大的成效。

    因为强大的帝国主义及其在中国的反动同盟军，总是长期地占据着中国的中心城市，如果革命的队伍不愿意和帝国主义及其走狗妥协，而要坚持地奋斗下去，如果革命的队伍要准备积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，并避免在力量不够的时候和强大的敌人作决定胜负的战斗，那就必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。

    中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。

    人民战争的战略战术
    你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。
    转引自林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》（一九六五年九月），人民出版社版第二八——二九页
    〔附录〕
    毛泽东同志把人民战争的战略战术，用四句话加以高度的概括，叫做：你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。
    这就是说，你依靠现代化的武器，我依靠有高度革命觉悟的人民群众；你发挥你的优势，我发挥我的优势；你有你的一套打法，我有我的一套打法。你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着。我打你时，就要打上你，打准你，吃掉你。我能吃掉你时就吃掉你，吃不掉你时也不让你吃掉我。打得赢不打是机会主义，打不赢硬打是冒险主义。我们的一切战略战役方针都是建立在打的这个基本点上。我们承认必须的走，是在首先承认必须的打的条件之下的。一切的走都是为着打，为着最后彻底消灭敌人。这种战略战术，只有依靠广大的人民群众才能实行。而实行这样的战略战术，就能充分发挥人民战争的优越性。不管敌人在技术装备上有什么优势，不管敌人采取什么办法来对付我们，它只能处于被动挨打的地位，主动权就始终在我们手里。
    林彪：《人民战争胜利万岁》（一九六五年九月），人民出版社版第二八——二九页
    我们的战略是“以一当十”，我们的战术是“以十当一”，这是我们制胜敌人的根本法则之一。
    《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二二○页
    我们的战术就是游击的战术。大要说来是：“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人。”“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”“固定区域的割据，用波浪式的推进政策。强敌跟追，用盘旋式的打圈子政策。”“很短的时间，很好的方法，发动很大的群众。”这种战术正如打网，要随时打开，又要随时收拢。打开以争取群众，收拢以应付敌人。
    《星星之火，可以燎原》（一九三○年一月五日），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一○七页
    我们的军事原则是：（1）先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌。（2）先取小城市、中等城市和广大乡村，后取大城市。（3）以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市和地方为主要目标。保守或夺取城市和地方，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，往往需要反复多次才能最后地保守或夺取之。（4）每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。在特殊情况下，则采用给敌以歼灭性打击的方法，即集中全力打敌正面及其一翼或两翼，求达歼灭其一部、击溃其另一部的目的，以便我军能够迅速转移兵力歼击他部敌军。力求避免打那种得不偿失的、或得失相当的消耗战。这样，在全体上，我们是劣势（就数量来说），但在每一个局部上，在每一个具体战役上，我们是绝对的优势，这就保证了战役的胜利。随着时间的推移，我们就将在全体上转变为优势，直到歼灭一切敌人。（5）不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，每战都应力求有准备，力求在敌我条件对比下有胜利的把握。（6）发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。（7）力求在运动中歼灭敌人。同时，注重阵地攻击战术，夺取敌人的据点和城市。（8）在攻城问题上，一切敌人守备薄弱的据点和城市，坚决夺取之。一切敌人有中等程度的守备、而环境又许可加以夺取的据点和城市，相机夺取之。一切敌人守备强固的据点和城市，则等候条件成熟时然后夺取之。（9）以俘获敌人的全部武器和大部人员，补充自己。我军人力物力的来源，主要在前线。（10）善于利用两个战役之间的间隙，休息和整训部队。休整的时间，一般地不要过长，尽可能不使敌人获得喘息的时间。以上这些，就是人民解放军打败蒋介石的主要的方法。这些方法，是人民解放军在和国内外敌人长期作战的锻炼中产生出来，并完全适合我们目前的情况的。……我们的战略战术是建立在人民战争这个基础上的，任何反人民的军队都不能利用我们的战略战术。

    从战争中学习战争——这是我们的主要方法
    战争的规律——这是任何指导战争的人不能不研究和不能不解决的问题。
    革命战争的规律——这是任何指导革命战争的人不能不研究和不能不解决的问题。
    中国革命战争的规律——这是任何指导中国革命战争的人不能不研究和不能不解决的问题。
    我们现在是从事战争，我们的战争是革命战争，我们的革命战争是在中国这个半殖民地的半封建的国度里进行的。因此，我们不但要研究一般战争的规律，还要研究特殊的革命战争的规律，还要研究更加特殊的中国革命战争的规律。
    大家明白，不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。

    指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。指挥员使用一切可能的和必要的侦察手段，将侦察得来的敌方情况的各种材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的思索，然后将自己方面的情况加上去，研究双方的对比和相互的关系，因而构成判断，定下决心，作出计划，——这是军事家在作出每一个战略、战役或战斗的计划之前的一个整个的认识情况的过程。
     《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一七三页
    战争的胜负，主要地决定于作战双方的军事、政治、经济、自然诸条件，这是没有问题的。然而不仅仅如此，还决定于作战双方主观指导的能力。军事家不能超过物质条件许可的范围外企图战争的胜利，然而军事家可以而且必须在物质条件许可的范围内争取战争的胜利。军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。
     《中国革命战争的战略问题》（一九三六年十二月），《毛泽东选集》第一卷第一七五页
    读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。没有进学校机会的人，仍然可以学习战争，就是从战争中学习。革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。
