The Japan Communist Party (Leftist Faction) of Yamaguchi Prefecture recently published an article in the *Chōshū Shinbun* exposing how the Revisionist Group led by Kyūemon has betrayed the revolutionary tradition of the anti-nuclear weapons movement and is collaborating with the Soviet revisionists in "united actions." This has led the movement astray, focusing on "pleading for peace" rather than fighting against American imperialism.

The article points out that Kyūemon and other revisionists have turned the leadership of the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs into their tool, sabotaging the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held last year. They have been scheming and plotting to lead the anti-nuclear weapons movement down the path of "pleading for peace" instead of fighting against the enemy of peace, American imperialism.

The article states that the history of the anti-nuclear weapons movement is a struggle between the proletarian line, which fights against American imperialism, the enemy of peace and the public enemy of all peoples of the world, and the bourgeois pacifist line, which does not fight against American imperialism but surrenders to it. In essence, it is a struggle between the Marxist-Leninist line and the revisionist line.

The article says that the Kyūemon Group has stolen the name of the "13th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" and has gathered the accomplices of American imperialism, the Soviet revisionists, and both old and new revisionists who support them. They are attempting to perform a worldwide farce of "united actions" with American imperialism. Those they have gathered to hold the "conference" are those who support "united actions" with the Soviet revisionists, those who advocate the "independent and autonomous" line that acknowledges bourgeois nationalism and xenophobia, and those who are enemies of the anti-imperialist, nationalist independence, and peaceful line of the world. The article states that the Kyūemon Group, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, is organizing an anti-China chorus. This is a "conference" that sabotages the world's people's anti-American international united front and is hostile to the seven hundred million Chinese people and the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who dare to fight against American imperialism. The article emphasizes that to oppose American imperialism, one must fight against its accomplice, the modern revisionist group. We must thoroughly expose and smash the pseudo "World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" organized by the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, which advocates pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-Chinese policies. We must draw a clear line with the revisionists, distinguish between just and unjust wars, and between national liberation wars that are anti-American and patriotic and imperialist wars of aggression. We must eliminate the view of terror towards nuclear weapons and clearly understand that nuclear weapons in the hands of the proletariat and those in the hands of imperialists are fundamentally different in nature. We must adhere to the principle of firmly supporting just wars and the proletariat's possession of nuclear weapons, uniting with the people of the world to launch a struggle against imperialism and for the defense of peace.

According to a report by the New China News Agency on the 11th, the Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Committee of Japan and the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers recently issued a joint statement strongly condemning the Japanese Communist Party revisionists for betraying the struggle of the peoples of all countries against American imperialism and sabotaging and splitting the anti-nuclear weapons movement.

The statement says that the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, at the so-called "13th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" held this year, put forward a black program that is essentially a surrender to American imperialism. They also whitewashed the number one accomplice of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and intensified their collusion with the Soviet revisionists to strengthen their anti-China activities. Thus, they have betrayed the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of all countries against American imperialism.

The statement points out that the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and revisionism and for national liberation is flourishing under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The seven hundred million people of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further consolidating China as a bastion for the peoples of all countries to fight against imperialism and for national liberation.

The statement says that the plot of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists to deceive the Japanese people and betray the struggle of the Japanese people and the peoples of all countries, and to sabotage their unity, will not succeed. Instead, they will further expose their ugly faces and ultimately be spat upon by the people. As Chairman Mao said: "Create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

The statement finally expresses the determination to unite with the broad masses of the Japanese people and the people of China and all countries, to firmly fight against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, Japanese reactionaries, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists, and to struggle for the liberation of the Japanese people and all oppressed peoples of the world and to overthrow the root cause of nuclear war—American imperialism.

    日共山口县委（左派）谴责日修同苏修大搞“统一行动”
    彻底粉碎宫本集团的亲美联苏反华路线
    日本两进步组织表示决心团结广大人民同日修坚决斗争
    新华社十一日讯　东京消息：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）最近在《长周新闻》上发表文章，揭露宫本修正主义集团背叛禁止原子弹氢弹运动的革命传统，同苏修搞“统一行动”，把这个运动引向“乞求和平”而不同美帝国主义进行斗争的邪路上去。
    文章指出，宫本显治等修正主义分子把日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会领导机构作为他们的工具，破坏了去年第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。他们处心积虑，策划阴谋，妄图把禁止原子弹氢弹运动引向“乞求和平”而不同和平的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争的邪路上去。
    文章说，禁止原子弹氢弹运动的历史，就是对和平的敌人、全世界人民的公敌美帝国主义进行斗争的无产阶级路线和不同美帝国主义进行斗争、而向美帝国主义投降的资产阶级和平主义路线之间的斗争史，其本质就是马克思列宁主义路线和修正主义路线之间的斗争史。
    文章说，宫本集团窃取“第十三届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”的名义，搜罗美帝国主义的帮凶苏联修正主义以及附和他们的新老修正主义，试图同美帝国主义一道表演为“联合行动”扫清道路的世界性滑稽剧。他们召集来举行“大会”的只是，那些赞成同苏修搞“统一行动”的人，承认资产阶级民族主义和排外主义的“独立自主”路线的人，承认同全世界反帝、民族独立、和平的路线为敌的人。文章说，宫本集团窃取“第十三届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”的名义，同苏联修正主义一鼻孔出气，组织反华大合唱。这是破坏全世界人民反美国际统一战线的“大会”，是敌视敢于同美帝国主义进行斗争的七亿中国人民和亚非拉各国革命人民的“大会”。文章强调说，要反对美帝国主义，就必须同它的帮凶现代修正主义集团进行斗争。我们必须彻底揭露和粉碎日共修正主义分子搞的亲美、联苏、反华的伪“禁止原子弹氢弹大会”。我们要同修正主义分子划清界线，区别正义的战争和非正义的战争，区别反美爱国的民族解放战争和帝国主义的侵略战争。我们必须消除对核武器恐怖的观点，必须明确无产阶级掌握的核武器和帝国主义者掌握的核武器在性质上是根本不同的。我们要坚持这样的原则态度，即坚决支持正义的战争和无产阶级掌握核武器，同全世界人民团结起来，展开反对帝国主义和保卫和平的斗争。
    据新华社十一日讯 据东方通讯社报道：亚非人民团结日本委员会和日本记者同盟最近发表联合声明，强烈谴责日共修正主义分子背叛世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，破坏和分裂禁止原子弹氢弹运动的罪行。
    声明说，日共修正主义分子在今年召开的所谓“第十三届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”上，抛出了实际上是投降美帝国主义的资产阶级和平主义的黑纲领，并且为美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义涂脂抹粉，加紧同苏修的勾结，以便加强反对中国的罪恶活动，从而出卖越南人民和世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    声明指出，现在世界各国人民反帝反修和争取民族解放的斗争，正在毛泽东思想的指引下，蓬勃发展。中国七亿人民在毛主席的领导下，正在中国无产阶级文化大革命中取得决定性的胜利，从而更加巩固了世界各国人民进行反帝和民族解放斗争的堡垒中国。
    声明说，日共修正主义分子欺骗日本人民背叛日本和世界各国人民的斗争，破坏他们的团结的阴谋是不能得逞的，相反地他们将更加暴露其丑恶的面目，最终为人民所唾弃。正如毛主席所说的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    声明最后表示决心团结日本广大人民以及中国和世界各国人民，同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派和日共修正主义分子进行坚决的斗争，为争取日本人民和全世界的被压迫民族的解放和打倒核战争的根源——美帝国主义而奋斗。
