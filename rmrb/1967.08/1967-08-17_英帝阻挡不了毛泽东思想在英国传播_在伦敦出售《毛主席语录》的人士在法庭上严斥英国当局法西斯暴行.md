Three progressive individuals were arrested by the London police authorities on August 6 for selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of Hyde Park. On August 14, they were subjected to another round of unreasonable "interrogation," and one of them was sentenced to three months in prison. This is another fascist crime committed by British imperialism in its attempt to block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Britain.

The three individuals arrested by the London police authorities on the trumped-up charge of "intentionally obstructing the doorway" are: the Indian progressive Bijul, the British youth teacher Martin Darling, and the former Polish worker Paul Pauluski. On August 14, they engaged in a fierce struggle with the British police authorities in court. Martin Darling cited numerous facts to show that the charges against him were completely unfounded. He said, "When I was arrested, there were five or six other people selling different publications in almost the same spot, and none of them were arrested by the police. Why was I the only one arrested?" His questioning left the police who accused him speechless and in a very awkward position. Darling emphasized that the facts proved that the police authorities arrested him not because of any "obstruction of traffic," but because he was selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They were afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and wanted to use fascist violence to stop its spread. The judge was very frightened by Darling's righteous refutation and repeatedly interrupted his speech. Especially when he mentioned Mao Zedong Thought, the judge tried to stop him from continuing.

Despite the numerous convincing facts that Darling presented to refute the London police authorities' unreasonable "charges," the court still unreasonably found him "guilty." Darling immediately protested against this, pointing out that the British police were trying to use fascist violence to stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, but this would not succeed. However, the court did not allow him to defend himself, and several police officers rushed in and forcibly dragged him out of the courtroom. As he left the courtroom, Darling shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Pauluski, upon entering the courtroom for his "interrogation," immediately shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and read out a protest statement he had prepared: "I protest against the use of fascist violence to interfere with the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. I protest against being illegally arrested and sent to Brixton Prison without a trial." He was also forcibly dragged out of the courtroom by the police.

Bijul also cited facts to refute the absurd charges against him during his "interrogation."

Many British and Asian-African individuals wearing Mao badges attended this "interrogation." After the "interrogation" ended, the court had to admit that the charges against Bijul could not be established, and sentenced Darling to a one-year "conditional release." However, Pauluski was still sentenced to three months in prison on a trumped-up charge.

The London authorities' unreasonable verdict once again exposed the savage nature and weak essence of British imperialism. No matter how much British imperialism tries to block and suppress, it will never be able to stop the unstoppable spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Britain.

Recently, many British and Asian-African progressive individuals living in Britain, out of their love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, have voluntarily used Sundays to sell "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges. This has been well received by the British people. The photo shows a foreign friend selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Hyde Park, London.

    英帝阻挡不了毛泽东思想在英国传播
    在伦敦出售《毛主席语录》的人士在法庭上严斥英国当局法西斯暴行
    新华社伦敦十五日电 由于在海德公园前出售《毛主席语录》而被伦敦警察当局在六日非法逮捕的三位进步人士，十四日再次受到无理的“审讯”，一位被捕者被悍然判处三个月的徒刑。这是英帝国主义妄图阻止毛泽东思想在英国的传播而犯下的又一次法西斯罪行。
    被伦敦警察当局以“有意阻塞门口通道”的莫须有罪名而强行逮捕的三人是：印度进步人士比朱尔、英国青年教师马丁·达林和原波兰籍工人保罗·保卢斯基。他们十四日在法庭上同英国警察当局展开了针锋相对的斗争。马丁·达林列举大量事实说明警察当局强加给他的罪名是完全站不住脚的。他说，他被捕时同他站在差不多相同位置的其他五六个出售其他出版物的人，都没有被警察逮捕，而单单逮捕他，这是为什么？他的质问弄得指控他的警察无言以对，十分狼狈。达林强调指出，事实证明，警察当局所以要逮捕他不是因为什么“妨碍交通”，而是因为他出售《毛主席语录》，是由于警察当局害怕毛泽东思想，他们想用法西斯暴力来阻止毛泽东思想的传播。法官对达林义正词严的驳斥十分恐慌，一再打断达林的发言。特别是在他提到毛泽东思想时，法官力图阻止他说下去。
    尽管达林列举的大量有说服力的事实，驳斥了伦敦警察当局对他的无理“控告”，法庭仍然无理判决他有“罪”。达林立即对此提出严正抗议，他指出，英国警察企图使用法西斯暴力来阻止毛泽东思想的传播，这是办不到的。但是法庭根本不允许他申辩，数名警察一拥而上把他强行拖出法庭。离开法庭时，达林高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    保卢斯基在被“审讯”时，一进入法庭就高呼“毛主席万岁！”并宣读他事先写好的抗议声明：“我抗议用法西斯暴力干预传播毛泽东思想，我抗议被非法逮捕和不加审讯就送进布里克斯顿监狱。”他也被警察强行拖出了法庭。
    比朱尔在受“审讯”时也列举事实驳斥了强加给他的荒唐的罪名。
    许多佩戴着毛主席像章的英国和亚非国家人士旁听了这次“审讯”。“审讯”结束后，法庭不得不承认对比朱尔的指控不能成立，判决达林在一年内“有条件的释放”，但是仍然以莫须有的罪名判处保卢斯基三个月监禁。
    伦敦当局的这一无理判决，再次暴露了英帝国主义的凶恶面目和虚弱本质。英帝国主义不管怎样封锁、镇压，也绝对阻挡不了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在英国的传播。（附图片）
    最近许多英国和亚非拉旅英进步人士，出于对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，自愿利用星期天出售《毛主席语录》、毛主席像章，深受英国人民的欢迎。图为一位外国朋友在伦敦海德公园出售《毛主席语录》。　新华社记者　于杭摄
