The PLA’s soldiers and officers resolutely support and defend the revolutionary masses in the Cultural Revolution, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to perform new feats for the people. They will better accomplish the glorious tasks of “three supports, two military affairs” assigned by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 9th, the soldiers and officers of the PLA’s army, navy, and air force, while celebrating the first anniversary of the convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, are earnestly studying Chairman Mao’s theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on carrying out revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. They have expressed their determination to closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support and defend the proletarian revolutionary masses, and hold high the banner of “supporting the army and loving the people.” They will better accomplish the tasks of “three supports, two military affairs,” and in the struggle to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, perform new feats for the people.

The PLA, personally founded by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has made tremendous contributions in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the tasks of “three supports, two military affairs” over the past year. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have stood firmly with the proletarian revolutionary masses in this fierce class struggle, sharing their joys and sorrows, and forging deep revolutionary friendships. As they celebrate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao’s brilliant work “Bombard the Headquarters” and the “Sixteen Points” personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the broad masses of soldiers and officers are even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. They actively criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois reactionary military line of his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and are determined to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and eliminate all its poisonous influences, accelerate the revolutionary construction of the troops, and further strengthen and improve the tool of proletarian dictatorship.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers excitedly say, “We are revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must respond to Chairman Mao’s great call to ‘support the army and love the people’ and join the proletarian revolutionary masses nationwide to fight together to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.”

In Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Taiyuan, Harbin, Guiyang, Qingdao, and other places, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA, with the deepest class feelings, resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary masses in seizing the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Now, in the new revolutionary upsurge of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, they are fighting more closely united with the proletarian revolutionary masses, studying Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster and the “Sixteen Points,” using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and fiercely criticizing and fighting against the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. In Shanghai’s Port Bureau’s Fifth Loading and Unloading Area, the soldiers and officers of a certain air force unit stationed in Shuangliu, while performing the task of supporting the left, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of “beating the fallen dog,” and have launched a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism.

In the thrilling class struggle, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the garrisons in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Sichuan, who have fought bravely to resolutely support and defend the proletarian revolutionary masses and achieved great victories, are actively helping the proletarian revolutionary masses in the new revolutionary upsurge of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters to promote revolutionary great unity; actively guiding the proletarian revolutionary masses to win over, educate, and unite the deceived masses, concentrating firepower and targets, aiming at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. The People’s Armed Forces Department of Zizhong City, Sichuan, which is known as the “red flag of the PLA supporting the left” by the local proletarian revolutionary masses, has, in the activities celebrating the first anniversary of the convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, mobilized the masses extensively to carry out revolutionary big-character posters. They are determined to, together with the local revolutionary masses, drown the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the vast ocean of people’s war. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the garrison in Leshan, Sichuan, have achieved great success and have many experiences in the work of winning over and educating the deceived masses. In the revolutionary big-character posters, the soldiers and officers have used their personal experiences to help the proletarian revolutionary masses win over, educate, and unite the deceived masses, making them, in the struggle to expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, raise their class consciousness and return to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses. In Inner Mongolia and Qinghai, the soldiers and officers who have established deep revolutionary friendships with the proletarian revolutionary masses such as the “Red Three Commands” of Hohhot and the “August 18th” of Qinghai, have, in the battle of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters with tens of thousands of cannons together with the broad revolutionary masses, helped the revolutionary masses further realize that only by thoroughly overthrowing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party politically, ideologically, and theoretically can we ensure that our country does not change color and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. It is only in the process of big-character posters that we can achieve and consolidate the revolutionary great unity and the “three-in-one combination,” and complete the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party.

At this crucial moment of fierce class struggle, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the garrison in Wuhan, who resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses and defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, with fighting enthusiasm, held solemn meetings and grand parades with the revolutionary vanguards of the proletarian revolutionary organizations in Wuhan such as “Steel Workers General,” “Steel Second Command,” “Steel September 13th,” “New Hua Workers,” “New Lake University,” “New Hua Farmers,” and “Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance.” The soldiers and officers pointed out in their speeches: To complete the historical task of smashing the bourgeois headquarters, we must definitely hold high the great banner of “supporting the army and loving the people,” wholeheartedly and unconditionally support and defend the proletarian revolutionary masses, and together with the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region, fight shoulder to shoulder until the final victory. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the 6955th Unit performing the task of supporting the left in the Changsha region, together with the masses of revolutionary organizations such as “Changsha Workers’ Union” and “Xiangjiang Thunder,” studied Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster and the “Sixteen Points” as well as the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, further deepening their class feelings with the revolutionary masses. The soldiers and officers said, “The PLA is the strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship and the faithful defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will unshakably stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses, accomplish the glorious tasks of ‘three supports, two military affairs’ assigned by Chairman Mao, and perform new feats in thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.” The soldiers and officers of the 8250th Unit of the garrison in Henan, who have made outstanding achievements in performing the task of supporting the left, have, in recent days, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses such as the “August 27th Commune” and the “August 24th” of Kaifeng, extensively carried out revolutionary big-character posters. This unit is the one that stood out and resolutely supported the revolutionary organizations such as the “August 27th Commune” when the proletarian revolutionary masses were persecuted. Now, they are determined to continue their efforts, advance victory upon victory, and do an even better job in supporting the left. The soldiers and officers of the leadership organs of the Lanzhou garrison who resolutely support the preparatory committee for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Jiangxi Province and the soldiers and officers of the leadership organs of the Lanzhou garrison who resolutely support the “Red Three Commands” in Gansu Province have, in recent days, firmly expressed: We are the close comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses. We will forever sail through storms and fight side by side with them, defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters to the death, and fight bravely to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪副主席亲自指挥的人民解放军，一年来，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”的工作中，作出了巨大贡献。广大指战员在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，紧紧地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，急他们所急，想他们所想，同他们结下了深厚的战斗友情。在庆祝毛主席的光辉文献《炮打司令部》和毛主席亲自主持制订的十六条发表一周年的时候，广大指战员更加意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们积极批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线和他在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级反动军事路线，决心彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，肃清它的一切流毒，加速部队革命化建设，进一步加强和改善无产阶级专政的工具。

    在北京、上海、济南、太原、哈尔滨、贵阳、青岛等地，人民解放军广大指战员，曾怀着最深厚的阶级感情，坚决支持无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺取了党政财文大权，现在，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的新的革命高潮中，他们和无产阶级革命派更加亲密团结地战斗在一起，学习毛主席的《炮打司令部》大字报，学习十六条，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批猛斗中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。在上海港务局第五装卸区执行支左任务的驻沪空军某部指战员，同无产阶级革命派一起，遵循毛主席的教导，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。
    在惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，为坚决支持和保卫无产阶级革命派而英勇奋战，取得伟大胜利的内蒙古、青海和四川等地驻军广大指战员，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的新的革命高潮中，积极帮助无产阶级革命派促进革命的大联合；积极引导无产阶级革命派，争取、教育、团结受蒙蔽的群众，集中火力，集中目标，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。被当地无产阶级革命派称为“解放军支左的一面红旗”的四川自贡市人民武装部，在庆祝党的八届十一中全会召开一周年的活动中，广泛发动群众，开展革命的大批判。他们决心同当地革命派一道，把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海中。四川乐山地区驻军某部在争取、教育受蒙蔽群众的工作中，有很大成绩，有很多经验，在革命的大批判中，指战员们纷纷用自己亲身的体会，帮助无产阶级革命派去争取、教育、团结受蒙蔽的群众，使他们在揭发批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的斗争中，提高阶级觉悟，回到毛主席革命路线上来，站到无产阶级革命派一边。在内蒙古、青海地区，与呼和浩特“红三司”、青海“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派建立了深厚战斗友谊的指战员们，在和广大革命群众一起万炮齐轰资产阶级司令部的战斗过程中，帮助革命群众进一步认识到，只有从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，才能保证我们的国家不变颜色，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，也只有在大批判的过程中，才能实现和巩固革命的大联合，革命的“三结合”，完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争。
    在两个阶级激烈搏斗的关键时刻，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，保卫毛主席革命路线的武汉驻军广大指战员，怀着战斗的豪情，和武汉无产阶级革命派组织“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、
  “新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等的革命闯将举行了隆重集会和盛大游行。指战员们在发言中指出：为了完成摧毁资产阶级司令部的历史任务，我们一定高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，全心全意地、毫不含糊地支持和保卫无产阶级革命派，并和武汉地区的无产阶级革命派一起，并肩战斗，直到最后胜利。在长沙地区执行支左任务的六九五五部队的广大指战员，和“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等革命组织的群众一起学习毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和十六条以及党的八届十一中全会公报，进一步加深了同革命派的阶级感情。指战员们说，人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者，我们一定坚定不移地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，完成毛主席交给我们的“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部立新功。在执行支左任务中作出优异成绩的河南驻军八二五○部队指战员，这几天和“二七公社”、开封“八·二四”无产阶级革命派一起，广泛开展了革命的大批判活动。这个部队是在无产阶级革命派受迫害的时刻，挺身而出，坚决支持“二七公社”等革命组织的。现在，他们决心再接再厉，乘胜前进，把支左工作做得好上加好。坚决支持江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会的六○一一部队，坚决支持甘肃“红三司”的兰州部队领导机关的指战员们，这几天都坚定地表示：我们是无产阶级革命派的亲密战友，我们要永远同他们风雨同舟，并肩战斗，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级司令部，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部而奋勇战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的更大的胜利。
