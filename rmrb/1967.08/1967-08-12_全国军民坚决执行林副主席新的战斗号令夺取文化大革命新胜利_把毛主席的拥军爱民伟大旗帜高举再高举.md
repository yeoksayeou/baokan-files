The nation's military and civilians resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin's new battle command to achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution and hold high the great banner of Chairman Mao's support for the military and love for the people.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, wrote the inscription for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. After the inscription was broadcast, the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces were filled with joy. The heroic soldiers who have made outstanding contributions in defending the nation's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the "three supports, two military" work enthusiastically cheered: This is the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Vice Chairman Lin's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for the People's Liberation Army; it is also the greatest support, greatest care, and greatest inspiration for the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people. They resolutely declared that they would turn Vice Chairman Lin's inscription into a great driving force, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions, and in the thorough criticism of the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, in the great struggle to defend the nation and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in carrying out the glorious tasks of "three supports, two military," strive to achieve even greater successes and create new merits for the people.

On the evening of the 10th, the joyous news of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works was broadcast nationwide. The entire army immediately bubbled with excitement. "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and "Resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call!" The cheers echoed across the nation's land and seas. Many units' party committees held emergency meetings overnight and issued instructions or notices to the troops before dawn about resolutely implementing Vice Chairman Lin's great call. Overnight, big-character posters and declarations expressing the soldiers' joy and firm resolve filled the camps, battlefields, airports, and ships.

The broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan, Hunan, Henan, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and other places, who are fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions, were particularly excited upon hearing the news. They pointed out that Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is our battle command to continue advancing, adding boundless strength to us. The commander of the Wuhan troops, Zhang Siyu, and the political commissar, Liu Feng, expressed with great emotion that all the soldiers and officers of the Wuhan troops will resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call and carry out Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions to the letter. We have the confidence and determination to do a good job in the "three supports, two military" work in the Wuhan area. In the work of supporting the left, we will have a firm stance and clear banner, resolutely defending the proletarian revolutionary factions. The troops stationed in Zhejiang, including the 6409th unit, expressed at today's celebration meeting that they will resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions, more enthusiastically support, care for, help, and rely on the proletarian revolutionary factions, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad ranks of soldiers of the 6517th unit, who are fighting side by side with the revolutionary youngsters in Wenzhou, enthusiastically cheered Vice Chairman Lin's call, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. They resolutely declared that they would defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group with their lives. In the Yanbian region of Jilin, the broad ranks of soldiers of the 3168th unit, who have always fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions, said excitedly when studying Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions that Vice Chairman Lin issued the most crucial instructions at the most critical moment. Although we have achieved some successes in the work of supporting the left, there is still a big gap in the new situation and new tasks. We must respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call with tenfold determination, tenfold enthusiasm, and tenfold effort, and create new merits for the people. The soldiers of the 6900th unit, who resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary factions in Hunan, said in a discussion of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription that Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not rely on past merits, but create new ones," and do the work of supporting the left even better. Today, the troops fighting on the front line of supporting the left, including the 6037th, 8133rd, 7848th, 3174th, 6113th, 8250th, 6810th, 601st units, and the troops stationed in Lanzhou and Tianjin, as well as the broad ranks of soldiers of the people's armed departments in Miji County, Shaanxi Province, and Zigong City, Sichuan Province, also expressed their determination to hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and in the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, stand with the proletarian revolutionary factions in love, hate, thought, and action, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the work of supporting the left, the Shandong Provincial Military Region, which has deeply examined its shortcomings and errors and gained the warm support of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people, said today that the work of supporting the left is a new and greater task, and it is inevitable to make some mistakes. The important thing is to correct the mistakes according to Chairman Mao's teachings as soon as possible. The sooner the better. Once the mistakes are corrected, new merits can be created for the people. After hearing Vice Chairman Lin's call, the leadership of the Kunming troops held an emergency meeting and decided to urge all levels of leadership and the broad ranks of cadres to firmly hold on to what is correct and correct what is wrong on the front line of "three supports, two military" and create new merits for the people with practical actions. In recent periods, the leadership of the Kunming troops and the Yunnan Provincial Military Region have adopted methods such as inviting people to come for discussions and going to seek opinions to widely listen to the opinions of the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses. Vice Chairman Lin's new instructions have given them great encouragement and motivation, and they are determined to achieve new successes in the "three supports, two military" work according to Vice Chairman Lin's instructions.

Today, the soldiers of the troops in Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and other places are joyfully and seriously studying and discussing Vice Chairman Lin's latest instructions. These heroic soldiers who have supported and helped the local revolutionary pioneers achieve victory in the power struggle expressed that they would forever be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience; forever believe in the masses and rely on the masses, correctly treat the masses; forever stand with the proletarian revolutionary factions, fight with them, and help them grasp power well and use power well, and in the revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly destroy the bourgeois headquarters, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

In the cheers for Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, the broad ranks of soldiers of the army, navy, and air force emphasized that to create new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, use Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as our guide and the guiding principle for all our work. Everyone is determined to learn from Vice Chairman Lin, take Vice Chairman Lin as an example, and most faithfully, firmly, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the great storms of struggle, we will push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, strive for new successes, and ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency reported on the 11th that the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, inscribed "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. The inscription has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people nationwide. They excitedly said: Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is, in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a very wise and timely new battle command issued to the People's Liberation Army, and it is also a new battle mobilization order issued to us proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people; it is Vice Chairman Lin's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for the People's Liberation Army, and it is also the greatest support, greatest care, and greatest inspiration for us. They expressed that they would resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's latest call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the military and loving the people," and stand with the glorious People's Liberation Army, fight with them, and win with them, and create new merits together in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin's great call reached Wuhan, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Harbin, and other places, and the local proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards were overjoyed, spreading the news and repeatedly shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The warriors of "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" in Hunan excitedly said: The People's Liberation Army is the great army personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. It is the strongest pillar of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the army responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call and took on the glorious tasks of "three supports, two military," making great contributions. Now, Vice Chairman Lin has issued a new battle call to the army. We firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, stand shoulder to shoulder with the army, and heart to heart, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly destroy the bourgeois headquarters, and create new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The warriors of "Red Three Commands" in Gansu excitedly said: In the past year of the Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary warriors of "Red Three Commands" have established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the soldiers and officers of the army. In every crucial moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, it is the army that has firmly supported us; in times of difficulty, it is the army that has given us strength; in hard times, it is the army that has helped us study Chairman Mao's works and used Mao Zedong Thought to point out the direction for our advance. The army has created immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary warriors of "Red Three Commands" will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and swear to stand with the army, fight with them, and win with them, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Guizhou, Qinghai, and Chengdu expressed when celebrating Vice Chairman Lin's inscription that they would learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from their noble qualities of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said that at present, especially, they should learn from the People's Liberation Army to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's battle call, and actively participate in the revolutionary great criticism mass movement, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon for revolutionary great criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly destroy the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao with their lives; they should learn from them in the great storms of class struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and gain valuable experience in firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards in Chengdu and Guiyang were extremely overjoyed after seeing the inscription. They said they would definitely learn from the army, take the army as an example, further carry forward the fearless revolutionary rebellious spirit, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to the Party, and in the revolutionary great criticism movement, charge forward and be the vanguard of revolutionary great criticism, and cultivate themselves into strong successors of the revolutionary cause. The warriors of the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai deeply felt that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well, like the army, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," continuously and thoroughly revolutionizing, can new merits be created for the people; only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can the revolutionary factions be united and fight together, and only from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects can the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev be thoroughly destroyed, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried to the end, making our country unchangeable. The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in various places expressed that they would definitely learn from the army's good experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the revolutionary great criticism, launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and swear to turn factories, rural areas, schools, and institutions into red Mao Zedong Thought schools!

The revolutionary rebels of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps, the "Three Commands" in Hohhot, and the revolutionary youngsters of Shandong Medical College expressed that the People's Liberation Army loves and supports the proletarian revolutionary factions the most, and the proletarian revolutionary factions believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army the most. The army is heart to heart with us. We must cherish the People's Liberation Army like our eyes and resolutely support the army's "three supports, two military" work with practical actions. The responsible person of the revolutionary mass organization of Shanghai Xianfeng Electric Machine Factory said: In the Cultural Revolution, the army's "love for the people" work has new content and greater significance; our "support for the military" work must also be done better and better. The greatest "support for the military" is to join the army in bravely launching a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing; it is to resolutely support and help the army do a better job in the "three supports, two military" work, fight side by side with the army, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The military and civilians are united as one, let's see who can defeat us? The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary youngsters in various places expressed that they would definitely hold high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people," follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army," closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and together make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better.
