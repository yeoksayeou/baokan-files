The great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" advocated by Chairman Mao has achieved victory. Guangdong, Hubei, and Yunnan have all had bumper early rice harvests.

The great revolutionary criticism has raised the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and community members, further establishing the idea of farming for the revolution. They are determined to press on and achieve an even greater harvest in the autumn crops.

Guangdong's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Determine to Press On and Achieve an Even Greater Harvest in the Autumn Crops

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: Amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, good news of a bumper early rice harvest has come from Guangdong Province. At present, the early rice in the entire province has been harvested, with the total yield significantly higher than last year. Many areas have seen unprecedented bumper harvests in many years. Various counties have emerged with high-yield production teams and high-yield fields. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically hail this year's bumper early rice harvest as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production"! It is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As soon as spring plowing began, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in an attempt to save their doomed fate, implemented a bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" on the issue of cadres, and spread a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism, attempting to sabotage production. At this critical moment, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" was published, greatly encouraging the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. They regarded the letter from the Party Central Committee as a timely rain, a mobilization order, and a battle cry, resolutely implementing it. Under the encouragement of the letter from the Party Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres doubled their efforts and completed the early rice transplanting tasks on time.

During the early rice production process, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in various places in Guangdong learned from the agricultural support troops of the People's Liberation Army, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront. In the nationwide movement to criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious," "three freedoms and one contract," and "four big freedoms" advocated by China's Khrushchev, as well as the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" on the issue of cadres. Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism, the political consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres has been increasingly heightened. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, forever walk the socialist path, and actively promote collective production.

At present, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in Guangdong Province are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. Based on the completion of the summer harvest work, they will press on to continue the struggle for an even greater harvest in the autumn crops.

Hubei's Total Yield and Per Unit Area Yield Both Exceed Historical Highs

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th: In the new stage of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region and the new upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, good news has come from all over Hubei Province: following the bumper summer grain harvest, this year's early rice has also seen a bumper harvest. Whether in total yield or per unit area yield, both have exceeded historical highs.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hubei Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," have directed the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into activities such as drought resistance, waterlogging drainage, and field management. Especially in many places, through the criticism of the reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious," "four big freedoms," and "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, the socialist consciousness of the broad community members has been further heightened, and the idea of farming for the revolution has been further established. Finally, they overcame various difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest, with some units achieving an average yield per unit area of 700 jin or even more than 700 jin in communes, districts, and counties.

Just as the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres were joyfully harvesting the early rice and transplanting the late rice, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region openly resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, brutally suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, and frantically sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The heinous crimes of these scoundrels have aroused the great indignation of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. In recent days, many regions' poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region on the threshing floors and in the fields. The ongoing mass movement of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle has become the strongest political driving force for the battle to harvest early rice and transplant late rice. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution in "beating fallen dogs," and while further deepening the great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region, to actively strengthen the field management of late rice and other autumn crops, and to fight against various natural disasters, continuing to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest for the entire year.

Yunnan Revolutionary Cadres Deeply Engage in the Frontline and Fight Side by Side with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 8th: In the high tide of revolutionary criticism against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, Yunnan Province's early rice has universally seen a bumper harvest. The total yield of early rice in Jinghong and Mengla counties in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the south has increased by more than onefold compared to last year; the early rice in Yuanjiang County in the Honghe River Basin has increased by about 20% compared to last year; and the early rice in Funing County in the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which borders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has increased by nearly onefold in area compared to last year, with the yield per unit area also significantly increased.

Yunnan Province's early rice increase this year is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the process from early rice planting to harvesting, the poor and lower-middle peasants of all ethnic groups in the province used Chairman Mao's works as a weapon to criticize the fallacies of "four big freedoms," "three freedoms and one contract," and "exploitation is meritorious" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, smashing their line of "technology first" and "work points as the commander," and a set of black goods for restoring capitalism, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the community members, and the idea of farming for the public and for the revolution was widely promoted. Therefore, the quality of early rice transplanting was good, the summer harvest efficiency was high, and grain was not wasted.

At a critical time when early rice was being transplanted, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party stubbornly implemented China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" on the issue of cadres. At this time, the local People's Liberation Army stood up and helped the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of various ethnic groups to study Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling cadres and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." Many grassroots revolutionary cadres were deeply moved and expressed their determination not to disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, eagerly entering the production frontline, fighting side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasping the revolution, and leading production. As a result, the early rice planting area was expanded, excellent varieties were promoted, and drought, pests, and other natural disasters were overcome, achieving a bumper early rice harvest.

    毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利
    广东湖北云南早稻丰收
    革命的大批判提高了广大干部社员的社会主义觉悟，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。他们决心乘胜前进，夺取秋季作物更大丰收
    广东贫下中农决心乘胜前进夺取秋季作物更大丰收
    据新华社广州八日电　在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，广东省传来了早稻丰收的好消息。目前，全省早稻已经收割完毕，总产量比去年有较大幅度的增长，其中不少地区是多年来未有过的大丰收。各县还出现了一批高产社队和高产田。广大贫下中农热烈欢呼今年早稻大丰收是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    今年春耕刚开始，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了挽救他们灭亡的命运，在干部问题上推行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，并且大刮反革命经济主义的妖风，妄图破坏生产。在这个关键时刻，《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表了，广大贫下中农和革命干部受到极大的鼓舞。他们把党中央的信看作是及时雨、动员令、进军号，坚决贯彻执行。在党中央的信的鼓舞下，广大贫下中农和革命干部干劲倍增，不违农时地完成了早稻插秧任务。
    在早稻生产过程中，广东各地广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，向解放军支农部队学习，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位。在全国掀起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动中，他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”“三自一包”“四大自由”等反动谬论，以及在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。通过活学活用毛主席著作和革命的大批判，广大革命群众和革命干部的政治觉悟越来越高，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。他们表示，坚决听毛主席的话，永远走社会主义道路，积极搞好集体生产。
    目前广东省广大贫下中农和农村革命干部决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在完成夏收工作的基础上，乘胜前进，为夺取秋季作物的更大丰收而继续斗争。
    湖北总产量和单位面积产量都超过历史上最高水平
    据新华社武汉八日电　在武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命进入新的胜利阶段，全国无产阶级文化大革命开始了新高涨的大好形势下，湖北省大江南北传来了振奋人心的喜讯：继夏粮大丰收之后，今年早稻又获得大丰收。无论总产量还是单位面积产量，都超过了历史上的最高水平。
    湖北省用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和革命干部，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，用到抗旱、排涝、田间管理等活动中去。特别是许多地方通过批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”等反动谬论，使广大社员更加提高了社会主义觉悟，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想，终于战胜了各种困难，取得了丰收，出现了一些单位面积产量平均达到七百斤以至七百斤以上的公社、区和县。
    正当广大贫下中农和革命干部满怀丰收的喜悦，积极抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，公然反抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，残酷地镇压革命群众运动，疯狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这些家伙的滔天罪行，激起了广大贫下中农和革命干部的极大愤慨。这些天，许多地区的贫下中农和革命干部，在稻场上，在田头，愤怒揭发、批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的滔天罪行。正在深入开展的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的群众运动，成了推动抢收早稻、抢插晚稻战斗的最强大的政治动力。广大贫下中农和革命干部决心更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更高举起革命的大批判的旗帜，发扬“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，在进一步开展对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内代理人的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的同时，积极加强晚稻和其他秋收作物的田间管理，和各种自然灾害作斗争，继续夺取全年农业大丰收。
    云南革命干部深入第一线同贫下中农并肩战斗
    新华社昆明八日电　在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命大批判的高潮中，云南省的早稻普遍获得丰收。南部西双版纳傣族自治州的景洪、勐腊两县，早稻总产量比去年增长一倍以上；红河流域元江县的早稻比去年增产两成左右；与越南民主共和国接壤的文山壮族苗族自治州富宁县，今年早稻面积比去年扩大近一倍，单位面积产量也大大增加。
    云南省今年早稻增产，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命又一丰硕成果。在早稻种植到收割的过程中，全省各民族的贫下中农，以毛主席著作为战斗武器，批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“剥削有功”等等修正主义的谬论，砸烂了他们推行的“技术第一”、“工分挂帅”等一套复辟资本主义的黑货，大大促进了社员的思想革命化，一心为公，为革命种田的思想得到了广泛的发扬。因此早稻栽插质量好，夏收工效高，还做到了不抛撒浪费粮食。
    有的地区正当栽插早稻的关键时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，顽固推行中国赫鲁晓夫的在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。这时，当地人民解放军挺身而出，帮助各族贫下中农和革命干部学习了毛主席有关正确对待干部的指示，和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，许多基层的革命干部深受感动，表示决不辜负毛主席的期望，纷纷深入生产第一线，同贫下中农并肩战斗，抓好革命，领导好生产。结果扩大了早稻种植面积，推广了良种，战胜了旱、虫等自然灾害，夺得了早稻大丰收。
