The spark of armed struggle ignited by the Thai people two years ago in northeastern Thailand has now spread to twenty-five of the country's seventy-one provinces. From August 7, 1965, to August 1, 1967, the Thai people's armed forces have engaged in over 500 battles, eliminating more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. The victory of the Thai people's armed struggle has caused the U.S. imperialists and their puppet Thanon reactionary regime to panic. They have cried out that Thailand is becoming "a second Vietnam."

Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong and inspired by the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Thai people have taken up the path of armed struggle.

As early as the years of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation, the great works of Comrade Mao Zedong on the problems of the Chinese revolution and the strategy and tactics of people's war had been introduced to Thailand. These works pointed out the correct path for the new democratic revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people had organized revolutionary armed forces to fight against the Japanese invaders during the period of Japanese imperialist occupation.

However, after the Second World War, U.S. imperialism replaced Japanese and British imperialism, invading Thailand in a big way. It supported the Thai reactionaries, established a puppet regime, and imposed fascist rule, turning Thailand into a U.S. military base and colony.

Through their own struggles and the experience of the Chinese revolution, the Thai people understood that only by taking up arms to fight decisively against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, only by using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution, and by following the victorious path of the Chinese revolution—establishing rural base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and seizing power through protracted armed struggle—they could thoroughly defeat the enemy and achieve victory in the new democratic revolution.

Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can war be waged, and only by relying on the people can war be waged."

Based on this principle, the revolutionaries led by the Communist Party of Thailand went deep into the remote countryside to organize the peasants. In 1961, the Communist Party of Thailand held its Third National Congress and issued a call to "intensify the mobilization and organization of the masses to wage a thorough struggle against the enemy." In recent years, the Communist Party of Thailand has led the peasants in struggles against the U.S.-Thai reactionaries' conscription of labor, against increased rent, against usury, and against the seizure of land to build military bases. At the same time, it has created conditions for the peasants to wage guerrilla warfare and establish rural base areas in extensive regions.

While winning over and organizing the peasants, to unite all revolutionary classes to fight the enemy and strengthen the revolutionary forces, the Thai Independence Movement was established on November 1, 1964, and the Thai Patriotic Front was established on January 1, 1965. Later, the Patriotic Workers' Union and the Patriotic Youth League were also established (all these organizations joined the Patriotic Front).

After several years of revolutionary organizational work and preparation, more than half a year after the establishment of the Patriotic Front, the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand finally fired the first shot of armed struggle on August 7, 1965, in Nong Khai village, Na Kae district, Nakhon Phanom province in northeastern Thailand. This marked the beginning of the people's revolutionary war against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. From then on, the Thai people's revolution entered a new stage.

In the past two years, the Thai people's armed forces have followed the great thought of Mao Zedong, using the strategy and tactics of people's war, and have rapidly grown stronger in their battles against the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

Although the Thai reactionary government, with the help and direction of U.S. imperialism, has dispatched increasing numbers of troops to carry out repeated "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the people's armed forces, the people's armed forces have each time smashed these campaigns and inflicted heavier casualties on the enemy. For example, in the "encirclement and suppression" campaign from December 1965 to May 1966, the people's armed forces killed or wounded more than 150 reactionary soldiers and police, including ten officers.

In battle, the people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's "Ten-Point Strategy" of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue," have dispersed among the masses to carry out political propaganda and mobilize the people, and have also concentrated superior forces to ambush or attack the enemy in motion or in isolated outposts. They are agile, brave, and clever, making the enemy passive and on the defensive everywhere.

In recent years, the people's armed forces have not only consolidated and expanded the guerrilla zones in the northeast but have also opened up new guerrilla areas in the south, central, and northern regions. Even the Thai reactionary leader Thanom had to admit in March of this year that the people's armed forces were able to occupy territory in various places. The governor of Sakhon Nakhon province in the northeast admitted in June of this year that of the 700 villages in the province, only 70 were "safe," and 90 percent of the villages were "areas of communist activity."

The vigorous development of the people's armed struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Thanom clique. To intensify the suppression of the people's armed struggle, the Johnson administration not only provided the Thai reactionary government with large amounts of military and economic "aid," helping to train and equip tens of thousands of police forces specifically for dealing with the guerrillas, but also dispatched U.S. imperialism's own so-called special forces and "airborne strike teams" to directly participate in the military suppression of the people's armed forces.

In the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Thailand, the Soviet revisionist leadership played the role of an accomplice. They colluded with the Thai reactionaries, openly and secretly, and continuously sent people to participate in the black meetings held in Bangkok, which included U.S. imperialism and its puppets from South Vietnam, South Korea, and the Taiwan Kuomintang bandits. Recently, there have been reports that the Soviet revisionists are collaborating with the U.S.-Thai reactionaries to round up Thai traitors and social scum, using various despicable means to try to sabotage the Thai people's armed struggle.

However, no matter how much the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs intensify their military suppression, and no matter how much the Soviet revisionist leadership engages in betrayal and sabotage activities, the flames of the Thai people's armed struggle cannot be extinguished. The Thai people are determined to further mobilize and organize the masses, wage armed struggle, and deal even heavier blows to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Thai reactionaries. The final victory will surely belong to the Thai people!

### 泰国人民武装斗争的星星之火越燃越旺  武装斗争已发展到全国七十一个府中的二十五个府，两年来歼敌一千多

    泰国人民武装斗争的星星之火越燃越旺
    武装斗争已发展到全国七十一个府中的二十五个府，两年来歼敌一千多
    泰国人民两年前在泰国东北部点燃起来的武装斗争的星星之火，今天已经燃烧到了全国七十一个府中二十五个府的广大地区。从一九六五年八月七日到今年八月一日的两年内，泰国人民武装同敌人作战五百多次，歼敌一千多人。泰国人民武装斗争的胜利发展，引起了美帝国主义及其走狗他侬反动政权的惶恐不安。它们惊呼泰国正在变成“第二个南越”。
    泰国人民是在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，在中国革命胜利的影响下，走上武装斗争的道路的。
    早在中国人民抗日战争和解放战争的年月里，毛泽东同志关于中国革命问题和人民战争的战略战术的一系列伟大著作就传入了泰国，给泰国人民指出了殖民地半殖民地国家进行新民主主义革命的正确道路。在泰国共产党的领导下，泰国人民曾经在日本帝国主义占领期间组织过革命的武装力量抗击日本侵略者。
    但是，第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义取代了日英帝国主义的地位，大举入侵泰国。它扶植泰国反动派，建立傀儡政权，实行法西斯统治，把泰国变成了美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    泰国人民从自身的斗争实践和中国革命的经验中懂得，只有拿起武器来对美帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的坚决斗争，只有以武装的革命反对武装的反革命，走中国革命的胜利道路，就是建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，通过长期的武装斗争来夺取政权，才能彻底打倒敌人，取得新民主主义革命的胜利。
    毛主席说，“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    根据这个道理，泰国共产党领导的革命者深入穷乡僻壤，进行发动农民的工作。一九六一年，泰国共产党召开第三次代表大会，发出了“加紧发动和组织群众与敌人进行彻底斗争”的号召。最近几年，泰国共产党一方面领导农民进行反对美泰反动派征用劳力、反对增加地租、反对高利盘剥和反对侵占土地建立军事基地的群众斗争，一方面在广泛地区发动农民群众为开展游击战争，建立农村根据地创造条件。
    在争取农民、组织农民的同时，为了联合各个革命阶级共同对敌，壮大革命力量，在一九六四年十一月一日成立了泰国独立运动，一九六五年一月一日成立了泰国爱国阵线，后来又先后成立了爱国工人联合会和爱国青年会（这些组织都加入了爱国阵线）。
    经过几年的革命组织工作和准备阶段以后，在爱国阵线成立的半年多以后，泰国共产党领导的人民武装，终于在一九六五年八月七日，在东北部那空拍侬府那家县的廊希村打响了武装斗争的第一枪，揭开了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的人民革命战争的序幕。从此，泰国人民革命开始了一个崭新的阶段。
    两年来，泰国人民武装遵循了伟大的毛泽东思想，运用人民战争的战略和战术，在同美泰反动派的战斗中迅速发展壮大起来。
    尽管泰国反动政府在美帝国主义的帮助和指挥之下出动越来越多的兵力对人民武装力量进行多次“围剿”，但是人民武装每一次都胜利地粉碎了“围剿”，给敌人以越来越大的杀伤。例如，在一九六五年十二月到一九六六年五月的“围剿”中，人民武装就毙伤反动军警一百五十人以上，其中包括十名军官。
    在战斗中，人民武装根据毛主席的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”十六字诀，时而分散于群众之中，进行政治宣传，以发动群众；时而集结优势兵力，伏击或袭击在运动中或孤立据点之敌。他们机动灵活、勇敢机智，使敌人到处被动挨打。
    近年来，人民武装不但巩固和扩大了东北部的游击区，而且在南部、中部和北部开辟了新的游击地区。甚至泰国的反动头子他侬在今年三月间也不得不承认，人民武装力量已经能够在各个地方占领地盘了。东北部沙功那空府的府尹在今年六月间承认，这个府里的七百个村庄只有七十个村庄是“安全的”，百分之九十的村庄都是“共产党活动的地区”。
    人民武装斗争的蓬勃发展，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗他侬集团的反动统治。为了加紧镇压人民武装斗争，约翰逊政府不但给予泰国反动政府大量的军事和经济“援助”，帮助训练和装备专门用来对付游击队的几万警察部队，而且还出动美帝国主义自己的所谓特种部队和“空中突击队”，直接参加对人民武装的军事镇压。
    在美帝国主义对泰国的侵略活动中，苏修领导集团扮演了帮凶的角色。他们同泰国反动派勾勾搭搭，明来暗去，不断派人参加在曼谷召开的有美帝国主义及其走狗南越、南朝鲜傀儡和台湾蒋介石匪帮参加的黑会。最近还有消息说明，苏修正在配合美泰反动派一起，搜罗泰国的叛徒和社会渣滓，采取各种卑鄙手段，企图破坏泰国人民武装斗争。
    但是，不管美帝国主义及其走狗怎样加紧进行武力镇压，也不管苏修领导集团怎样进行叛卖破坏活动，泰国人民武装斗争的烈火是扑灭不了的。泰国人民决心进一步发动和组织群众，开展武装斗争，给美帝国主义及其走狗泰国反动派以更加沉重的打击。最后胜利一定属于泰国人民！
