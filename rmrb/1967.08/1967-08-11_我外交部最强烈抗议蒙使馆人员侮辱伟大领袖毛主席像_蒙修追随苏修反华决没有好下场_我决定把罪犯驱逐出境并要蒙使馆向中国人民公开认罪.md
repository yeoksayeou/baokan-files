The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged the strongest protest against the Mongolian embassy staff for insulting the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. The Mongolian revisionists, following the Soviet revisionists in their anti-China stance, will meet a bad end. I have decided to expel the culprit from the country and demand that the Mongolian embassy publicly apologize to the Chinese people.

	New China News Agency, August 10th – The responsible official of the Second Asian Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Mongolian Ambassador to China, Tsevegmid, this evening and handed him a protest note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting against the insult to the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao by a staff member of the Mongolian Embassy in China and demanding an apology from the Mongolian government.

	The note states that at 11:20 AM on August 9, 1967, Dash-Oerelt, a staff member of the Mongolian Embassy in China, brazenly stepped on the portrait of Chairman Mao, the sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, while driving his car parked in front of the Friendship Store on Donghuamen Street in Beijing, desecrating it. This is a serious political provocation against the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and a grave insult to the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people. Passersby immediately pointed out to him that this provocative behavior is a serious crime and that he must confess and apologize. However, Dash-Oerelt not only refused to confess but also resorted to hooliganism, maliciously provoking our revolutionary masses and attempting to tear up the portrait of Chairman Mao and drive away. Our revolutionary masses were extremely indignant and immediately handed him over to the public security authorities.

	The note emphasizes that the serious anti-China political provocation by the staff member of the Mongolian Embassy in China is not an isolated incident. The Mongolian revisionist leadership, due to its reactionary class nature, has always followed the Soviet revisionists and acted as their lackey, hating and fearing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and our unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the core. Especially the great victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Mongolian revisionist leadership, like other reactionary forces, viciously attacks Chairman Mao, who personally initiated and led this cultural revolution, and has created a series of anti-China provocations. Just this year, in addition to mobilizing all its propaganda machinery to carry out anti-China propaganda, the Mongolian revisionist leadership has twice smashed our news picture windows in Mongolia and deliberately created the May 21st anti-China bloodshed incident at the Ulaanbaatar train station, unjustly sentenced our innocent overseas Chinese Jia Xiwen and others to imprisonment. Recently, the Mongolian revisionist leadership has also encouraged and shielded Soviet revisionists in Mongolian troops participating in anti-China atrocities, resulting in two bloody incidents in Ulaanbaatar alone where Soviet military personnel driving cars have killed and injured Chinese overseas Chinese. This time, a staff member of the Mongolian Embassy in China dared to publicly insult the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao in the capital of China, which is another new manifestation of the Tsedendamba-led group's unshakable pursuit of the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance. The Chinese people and the Chinese government strongly condemn the heinous crime committed by the staff member of the Mongolian Embassy in China and lodge the strongest protest against the Mongolian government.

	The note states that the Chinese government and the Chinese people once again warn the Mongolian authorities: The heinous crimes you have committed against the Chinese people will be settled by the Chinese people, and you will not be able to escape responsibility! The American imperialists' anti-China stance will not end well, the Soviet modern revisionists' anti-China stance will not end well, and the Tsedendamba-led group's pursuit of its master, the Soviet revisionists, in their anti-China stance will also not end well!

	The note states that the Chinese government solemnly demands that the Mongolian Embassy in China immediately confess and apologize to the Chinese people and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. The Chinese government has decided to expel Dash-Oerelt, the culprit who insulted the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, from the country.

    我外交部最强烈抗议蒙使馆人员侮辱伟大领袖毛主席像
    蒙修追随苏修反华决没有好下场
    我决定把罪犯驱逐出境并要蒙使馆向中国人民公开认罪
    新华社十日讯　我国外交部第二亚洲司负责人今晚召见蒙古驻华大使策伯格米德，交给他我国外交部的一份抗议照会，就蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员侮辱中国人民和世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席像，向蒙古政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说，一九六七年八月九日上午十一时二十分，蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员达希敖额尔特，在停放于北京东华门大街友谊商店门口他所驾驶的汽车内，放肆地把中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席像踩在脚下，加以亵渎。这是公然反对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的严重政治挑衅行为，是对中国人民和世界革命人民的极大侮辱。路过的中国革命群众发现后当即向他严正指出，这种挑衅行为是严重的犯罪，必须对此认罪、道歉。但是，达希敖额尔特不但拒不认罪，反而耍流氓手段向我国革命群众恶意挑衅，企图撕毁毛主席像开车逃跑。我国革命群众万分愤慨，当即把他扭送治安机关。
    照会强调指出，蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员的这一严重反华政治挑衅，绝不是一个孤立的事件。蒙古修正主义领导集团由于其反动的阶级本性，一贯追随苏修、充当苏修走卒，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，恨得要死，怕得要命。特别是我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，敲响了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的丧钟。蒙古修正主义领导集团同其它反动势力一样，恶毒攻击亲自发动和领导这场文化大革命的毛主席，并且制造了一系列反华挑衅事件。仅今年以来，蒙修领导集团除动员其全部宣传机器大肆进行反华宣传外，曾两次砸毁我国驻蒙使馆新闻图片橱窗，并蓄意制造五月二十一日乌兰巴托车站反华流血事件，无理判处我无辜侨民贾秀文等徒刑。最近，蒙古修正主义领导集团，又纵容和包庇苏修在蒙驻军参与反华暴行，仅在乌兰巴托一地就连续发生两起苏修军人驾驶汽车撞死、撞伤华侨的流血惨案。这次蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员竟敢在中国的首都公然侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席的像，是蒙古泽登巴尔集团死心塌地追随苏修反华的又一新的表现。中国人民和中国政府严厉谴责蒙古驻华大使馆工作人员所犯下的这一滔天罪行，并向蒙古政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说，中国政府和中国人民再次警告蒙古当局：你们对中国人民所犯下的滔天罪行，中国人民是一定要清算的，你们想赖是赖不掉的！美帝国主义反华没有好下场，苏联现代修正主义反华没有好下场，泽登巴尔领导集团追随其主子苏修反华也决不会有好下场！
    照会说，中国政府严正要求蒙古驻华大使馆立即向中国人民公开认罪、道歉，并保证今后不再发生此类事件。中国政府决定，把侮辱中国人民和世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席像的罪犯达希敖额尔特驱逐出境。
