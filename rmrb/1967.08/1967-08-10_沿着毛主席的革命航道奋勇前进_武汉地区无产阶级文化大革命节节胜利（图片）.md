The proletarian revolutionary forces, revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region are earnestly studying a letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They are determined to carry out the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee without the slightest deviation and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The Party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth; Chairman Mao is closer than parents.
The proletarian revolutionary forces, revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region have unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They are determined to sail against the wind and waves on the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao!

Rats crossing the street are shouted at by everyone.
The proletarian revolutionary forces, revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region are indignantly denouncing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the army have become rats crossing the street, shouted at by everyone. The great criticism movement is developing victoriously in the Wuhan region.

The people and the army are united as one; see who can stand against us.
The revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." They are determined to unite and fight together to decisively overthrow, smash, and expose China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region.

Grasp the revolution and promote production.
The proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region are resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great instruction to "grasp the revolution and promote production." They are firmly holding their production posts and, with their practical actions, are smashing the plots of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the army who are desperately struggling to sabotage production.

Those deceived are not guilty; those who turn against the enemy are meritorious.
Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the masses in the Wuhan region who were deceived by the "Million Heroes" are awakening and rising up in rebellion. The "Million Heroes" are crumbling. This is a joint meeting of the deceived masses, cadres, and comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces to denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes."
