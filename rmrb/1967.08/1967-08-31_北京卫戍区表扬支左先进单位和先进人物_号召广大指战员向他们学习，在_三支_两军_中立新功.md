The Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army recently commended a group of advanced units and individuals who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely supported and protected the revolutionary leftists, shared their urgencies, thoughts, and needs. These advanced collectives and outstanding individuals have shown a common characteristic: in the intense class struggle, they actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to solve various practical problems in the struggle. They have made outstanding achievements in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "Three Supports, Two Military" work.

This time, those commended include:

* Active individuals and advanced collectives who responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "support the broad masses of the left," raised the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, united and fought alongside the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses.
* Excellent soldiers who firmly supported and protected the proletarian revolutionary masses while performing guard duties.
* Model individuals who love the people and, in times of crisis, bravely stepped forward to protect the people's lives and property.

The Beijing Municipal Pinggu County Armed Forces Department, praised by local revolutionary masses as the red flag for supporting the left, has, since the Cultural Revolution, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and correctly handled the mass movement. At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses seized power from a handful of capitalists within the county committee, they stood up and supported the revolutionaries with practical actions. To consolidate the achievements of the seizure of power, the comrades of the Armed Forces Department helped the revolutionaries study Chairman Mao's works in the midst of the intense mass struggle, deeply criticized the "strike a large number, protect a few" part of the bourgeois reactionary line, and helped the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, politically and ideologically uniting the majority of the masses and strengthening the ranks of the revolutionaries, thus powerfully promoting the proletarian cultural revolution throughout the county.

The active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Sergeant Wang Ziying of a certain unit's 9th Company, broke away from the "fear" in his mind through studying Chairman Mao's works, bravely stepped onto the military training frontline in a middle school in Beijing, and, through careful investigation and research, supported the revolutionary mass organizations. Soon, some in the revolutionary organizations he supported raised sharp criticisms of the military training. Wang Ziying was initially confused and emotionally distant from these people. At this time, he recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will, in this process of criticism, correctly recognize the world and change the world." He seriously examined his work, discovered that the military training indeed had shortcomings such as not trusting the masses enough, and actively made a self-criticism to the students. This not only educated himself but also educated the broad student body. He then organized the students to study Chairman Mao's works, open the door for rectification, break away from selfishness, break away from the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, relatively quickly uniting the two revolutionary mass organizations in the class.

The active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Political Department staff member Zhang Zhiguo of a certain unit, initially stood on the wrong side in the support-left work. He then, with the practical questions of "how to identify revolutionary leftists?" and "how to conduct class analysis?", studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." He gradually clarified that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, conducting class analysis based on the struggle between the two lines is the most fundamental class analysis, and the standard for identifying revolutionary leftists is whether they stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines. After Zhang Zhiguo's awareness was raised, he took a firm stance and attitude to support the revolutionary leftists.

Sergeant Liu Dalan of a certain unit's 9th Company, who is in charge of guarding the Tiananmen Square and other areas in the capital, shares the same breath and fate with the revolutionary comrades who charge forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When the Red Guards revolutionary youngsters took to the streets to smash the Four Olds, he patrolled day and night in the alleys for them; when the revolutionary masses debated and posted big-character posters on the streets in the cold winter nights, he stood guard for them in the cold wind. This son of a poor peasant loves Chairman Mao immensely and has made new achievements in guarding the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing. In April this year, Liu Dalan was elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Political Instructor Kong Xiangxiu of a certain unit's 12th Company, was promoted from a soldier to an officer and then served as a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, he remained humble and cautious, maintained the character of a proletarian revolutionary soldier, loved revolutionary soldiers, and loved revolutionary masses.

Among the advanced individuals commended by the Beijing Garrison, there are also those who are fearless in danger and selfless, such as Chang Tingwen, Jia Qihui, and Yao Yuxi.

The leading organs of the Beijing Garrison call on all officers and soldiers to learn from these advanced units and individuals, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and make new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    北京卫戍区表扬支左先进单位和先进人物
    号召广大指战员向他们学习，在“三支”“两军”中立新功
    据新华社三十日讯　中国人民解放军北京卫戍区最近表扬了一批在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决支持和保护革命左派，急左派所急，想左派所想，帮左派所需的先进单位和先进人物。
    这些先进集体和优秀人物的共同特点是，在激烈的阶级斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想解决斗争中的各种现实问题，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”的工作中，作出了优异成绩。这次受表扬的：有积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的号召，高举“拥军爱民”旗帜，在“三支”“两军”工作中，与无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起的积极分子和先进集体；有在执行警卫任务时，坚决支持和保卫无产阶级革命派的优秀指战员；还有无限热爱人民，在革命群众生命危急时机，挺身而出，保护人民生命财产的模范人物。
    被当地革命群众誉为支左红旗的北京市平谷县武装部，从文化大革命以来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正确对待群众运动。在无产阶级革命派夺县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大权的关键时刻，他们挺身而出，用实际行动支持革命派。为了巩固夺权成果，武装部的同志又在火热的群众斗争中，帮助革命派学习毛主席著作，深入批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，帮助受蒙蔽群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，从政治上、思想上团结了大多数群众，壮大了革命派的队伍，有力地推动了全县的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部九连排长王子英，通过学习毛主席著作，破除了头脑中的“怕”字，勇敢地走上军训的第一线，在北京市的一所中学里，经过细致的调查研究支持了革命群众组织。不久，他所支持的革命组织中，有些人对军训提出了尖锐的批评。王子英一时想不通，感情上对这些人有点疏远。这时他想起毛主席的教导：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。”他认真地检查了自己的工作，发现军训工作中确实存在着不够相信群众等缺点，就主动地向同学们作了检讨。不仅教育了自己，也教育了广大同学。他又组织同学们学习毛主席著作，开门整风，大破“私”字，大破资产阶级反动路线的影响，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，比较快地使班级里的两个革命群众组织联合起来。学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部政治部干部张治国，在支左工作中，开始曾站错了队。于是他就带着“应该怎样识别革命左派？”“应该怎样进行阶级分析？”等现实问题，学习了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》等光辉著作。他逐渐明确了在无产阶级文化大革命中，以两条道路斗争为纲进行阶级分析，是最根本的阶级分析，识别革命左派的标准不是别的，就是看他们在两个司令部、两条路线的斗争中，是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。张治国认识提高以后，采取了坚决支持革命左派的立场和态度。
    担负着首都天安门等地警卫任务的某部九连班长刘大乱，和无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命派战友，同呼吸，共命运。当红卫兵革命小将走上社会，大破四旧的时候，他日夜巡逻在街巷，为他们站岗；当革命群众在严冬的夜晚，在街头辩论、贴大字报的时候，他冒着寒风为他们放哨。这位贫农的儿子，无限热爱毛主席，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命策源地北京的工作中立下了新功。今年四月，北京市革命委员会成立时，刘大乱被选为北京市革命委员会委员。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部十二连政治指导员孔祥秀，由战士提升干部，并担任北京市革命委员会委员以后，按照毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，保持无产阶级革命战士本色，热爱革命战士，热爱革命群众。
    北京卫戍区表扬的先进人物中，还有临危不惧、舍己为人的常廷文、贾歧会、姚玉琪等。
    北京卫戍区领导机关号召广大指战员向这些先进单位和先进人物学习，活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起“拥军爱民”的旗帜，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
