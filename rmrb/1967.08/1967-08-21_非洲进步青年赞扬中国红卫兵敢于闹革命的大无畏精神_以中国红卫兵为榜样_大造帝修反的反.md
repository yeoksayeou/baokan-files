Progressive youth and students from Africa in Cairo highly praise the fearless revolutionary spirit of Chinese Red Guards under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have decided to take the Red Guards as their example, to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, and to contribute to the struggle of the African people against imperialism and for national liberation.

Tonight, they watched two films at the Chinese Embassy in the United Arab Republic to celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's first reception of the Red Guards: "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Reviews of the Cultural Revolution Army" and "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

Whenever the screen showed the most red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, they applauded and cheered enthusiastically time and again.

After watching the films, a Tanzanian youth said, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is excellent." He said, "We congratulate the Chinese Red Guards on their victory. They are the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. In Africa, we need our own Red Guards."

A student from Sierra Leone said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the Red Guard movement have shattered the imperialists' dream of restoring capitalism through the younger generation. The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the great October Revolution. The Chinese revolutionary youth, guided by the great leader Chairman Mao, will undoubtedly take over the revolutionary torch from the older generation of revolutionaries and, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, carry the socialist revolution to the end.

A youth from Botswana said, "The Red Guard fighters have made outstanding contributions to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat by holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards have set a living example for all revolutionary youth in the world in transforming their worldview and revolutionizing their countries. Under the inspiration and personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Red Guards, together with all the revolutionary people of China, will certainly carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to final victory."

A Sudanese student said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a beacon for the African people, and Chairman Mao's works are treasures of revolution. We all resolve to take the Red Guards as our example and study Chairman Mao's works diligently to serve our people."

A youth from Angola said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Only by learning and applying the invincible Mao Zedong Thought can the African people achieve victory in their struggle against imperialism and for liberation."

    非洲进步青年赞扬中国红卫兵敢于闹革命的大无畏精神
    以中国红卫兵为榜样　大造帝修反的反
    新华社开罗十八日电  在开罗的非洲进步青年和学生高度赞扬中国红卫兵在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下敢于闹革命的大无畏精神，并决心以红卫兵为榜样，努力学习毛主席著作，为非洲人民反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的斗争作出贡献。
    他们今晚在中国驻阿联大使馆观看了为庆祝毛主席首次接见红卫兵一周年而放映的《毛主席第五次和第六次检阅文化革命大军》和《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》两部影片。
    这些非洲进步青年和学生每当看到银幕上出现世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席时，就一次又一次地热烈鼓掌欢呼。
    观看电影后，一位坦桑尼亚青年说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命好极了。”他说：“我们祝贺中国红卫兵取得胜利。他们最忠于毛泽东思想。在非洲，我们需要自己的红卫兵。”
    一位塞拉勒窝内的学生说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动粉碎了帝国主义企图通过年轻的一代复辟资本主义的梦想。苏联修正主义领导集团已经背叛了伟大的十月革命。受到伟大领袖毛主席教导的中国革命青年，无疑将从老一代的革命者手里接过革命的火炬，并在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下把社会主义革命进行到底。
    一位博茨瓦纳青年说：“红卫兵战士高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了杰出的贡献。红卫兵为全世界一切革命青年在改造自己的世界观和使自己的国家革命化方面树立了活生生的榜样。红卫兵在毛主席的鼓舞和亲自领导下，同全中国的革命人民一道，一定会把无产阶级文化大革命进行到最后胜利。”
    一位苏丹学生说：“毛泽东思想是非洲人民的灯塔，毛主席著作是革命之宝。我们大家决心以红卫兵为榜样，努力学习毛主席著作，以便为我国人民服务。”
    一位安哥拉青年说：“毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。我们非洲人民只有学习和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，才能获得反对帝国主义、争取解放斗争的胜利。”（附图片）
