Vietnamese newspapers and South Vietnamese Liberation Radio have hailed the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in annihilating two intruding American aggressor aircraft and capturing one American air pirate on August 21.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 23: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published commentaries on August 23, enthusiastically hailing the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in annihilating two intruding American aggressor aircraft and capturing one American air pirate on August 21. The commentary in the "People's Daily" stated that in recent times, American imperialism, in addition to dispatching aircraft to attack many areas in northern Vietnam near the Chinese border, has also repeatedly infiltrated southern Chinese airspace and even brazenly attacked Chinese military and civilians.

The commentary pointed out that it is clear that the provocation by American aircraft on August 21 was a deliberate act of war.

The commentary said that the American aggressors once again received the punishment they deserved from the Chinese military and civilians. If they dare to continue using force to intimidate the 700 million Chinese people, they will surely face even more severe punishment.

The "People's Army Daily" also published a commentary, enthusiastically hailing and congratulating the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army for their new glorious achievement in annihilating the intruding American aircraft.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 24: South Vietnamese Liberation Radio recently published a commentary, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in shooting down two intruding American aircraft on August 21.

The commentary said that American imperialism has received the punishment it deserves, which is the Chinese people's practical response to the aggressors.

The commentary said that while American imperialism is escalating its aggression against Vietnam, it has also repeatedly dispatched aircraft and warships to brazenly provoke the Chinese people. Obviously, these aggressive actions by American imperialism are well-planned.

The commentary said that the powerful declaration in the "People's Daily" on August 22, stating that "any invaders will be decisively, thoroughly, and completely annihilated," and the glorious achievement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in annihilating the intruding American imperialist aircraft on August 21, serve as a warning to the Johnson clique. If they continue to recklessly engage in new military adventures, they will surely face even more severe punishment.

New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 24: The Cambodian "Motherland Daily" published a commentary on August 24 regarding the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force's annihilation of two American aircraft that violated Chinese airspace. The commentary stated: "If American imperialism dares to provoke a war against China, it will surely suffer defeat."

The commentary said that the Chinese Air Force's annihilation of two intruding American aircraft demonstrates that China has the full capability to resist American imperialist barbaric aggression.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people, Chinese people, and people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America firmly believe that this is an era of defeat for American imperialism. Despite American imperialism's desperate struggles, it is certain that the day of its downfall will come.

    越南报纸和南越解放电台欢呼我空军全歼美机的辉煌胜利
    美帝如继续挑衅必遭更严厉惩罚
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》二十三日分别发表评论，热烈欢呼中国人民解放军空军二十一日全歼入侵中国广西领空的美国强盗飞机两架和活捉美国飞贼一名的辉煌战功。《人民报》的评论说，最近期间，美帝国主义除了派遣飞机袭击紧靠中国边界的越南北方的许多地区以外，还连续潜入中国南方领空，甚至肆无忌惮地袭击中国军民。
    评论指出，很明显，美国飞机八月二十一日进行的挑衅是蓄意采取的战争行动。
    评论说，美国强盗又一次遭到了中国军民给予的应得的惩罚。如果它胆敢继续用武力吓唬七亿中国人民，它就必将遭到更加严厉的惩罚。
    《人民军队报》也发表评论，热烈欢呼和祝贺英雄的中国人民解放军全歼入侵美机的新的辉煌战功。
    新华社河内二十四日电　越南南方解放电台最近发表评论，热烈欢呼中国人民解放军空军二十一日一举击落入侵美机两架的辉煌胜利。
    评论说，美帝国主义遭到了应得的惩罚，这是中国人民以实际行动对侵略者的回答。
    评论说，美帝国主义在对越南进行侵略战争“升级”的同时，还多次派遣飞机和军舰，对中国人民进行猖狂的挑衅。显然，美帝国主义的这些侵略行动是有计划的。
    评论说，中国《人民日报》八月二十二日发表的社论中提出的“有来犯者必定坚决彻底干净全部消灭之”的有力声明和中国人民解放军空军二十一日全歼入侵的美帝国主义飞机的辉煌战功，是对约翰逊集团的警告。如果它们继续疯狂地进行新的军事冒险，就必定遭到更严厉的惩罚。
    新华社金边二十四日电　柬埔寨《祖国报》二十四日就中国人民解放军空军部队全歼两架侵犯中国领空的美机发表评论说：“如果美帝国主义敢于向中国挑起战争的话，它肯定要遭到失败。”
    评论说，中国空军全歼两架入侵美机表明，中国完全有力量抗击美帝国主义的野蛮侵略。
    评论说，越南人民、中国人民和亚非拉人民深信，这个时代是美帝国主义吃败仗的时代。尽管美帝国主义力图垂死挣扎，可以肯定，美帝垮台的日子定要到来。
