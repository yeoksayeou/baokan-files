"Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stand new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is the inscription by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, on August 9, for the Beijing Garrison's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works.

The Beijing Garrison troops have made significant contributions to protecting our great leader Chairman Mao, protecting Chairman Mao's headquarters, protecting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and supporting and aiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is a new call to arms for the Beijing Garrison troops and the entire army. This is Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for the Beijing Garrison troops and all military personnel! This call has extremely important guiding significance and far-reaching influence for our army in completing the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" and protecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for the revolutionary construction of the troops, and for promoting a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the army and the nation. We must enthusiastically respond, study and understand it thoroughly, and resolutely carry it out.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Do not rely on past merits, but strive for new achievements." Currently, our army is shouldering the glorious task of "three supports, two militaries." This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust in our army and also a stern test for each of our units and comrades. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, work diligently and conscientiously, preserve our revolutionary youth, and continually stand new achievements for the people.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most important thing to stand new achievements for the people is to firmly, unhesitatingly, and wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary factions, support their seizure of power, holding of power, and use of power, and support all their revolutionary actions. In any situation, we must be their steadfast rear guard. The better the work of supporting the left, the more and greater new achievements we stand for the people. All officers and soldiers of our army must resolve to do the work of supporting the left even better.

In carrying out this new and great historical task, it is not strange to make some mistakes. If we make mistakes, we must admit them frankly, make public self-criticisms, and correct them thoroughly and promptly. We must not be shy or hesitant. Mistakes corrected are also new achievements for the people. We must, as Vice Chairman Lin teaches, regard ourselves both as a force for the revolution and as an object of the revolution. For things we do not understand and work we do not know how to do, we must consult Chairman Mao and strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. While transforming the objective world, we must also transform the subjective world, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and forever be faithful servants of the people, sailing against the wind and waves, and advancing ceaselessly.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, whether in the past, present, or future, is the beacon guiding us from victory to victory. To stand new achievements for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely support and protect the proletarian revolutionary factions. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are our guide to action and the guiding principles for all our work. We must resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and handle all problems. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Learn in struggle, use in struggle. Consciously learn, consciously use. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we must resolutely carry out and execute. We must resolutely carry out and execute what we understand, and also resolutely carry out and execute what we do not yet understand. Whatever goes against Chairman Mao's instructions and Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely resist and struggle against. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must resolutely overthrow them. We must hold high the banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions, launch a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their representatives in the army, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and resolutely overthrow them, criticize them deeply and thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

We swear to defend Chairman Mao with our lives, swear to defend Vice Chairman Lin with our lives, swear to defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our lives, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stand new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (August 11)

    为人民立新功
    “高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，八月九日为北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的题词。
    北京卫戍区部队，为保卫我们伟大领袖毛主席，保卫毛主席的司令部，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫和支援首都的无产阶级文化大革命，作出了重大的贡献。林副主席的这一题词是对北京卫戍区部队和全军发出的新的战斗号召。这是毛主席和林副主席对北京卫戍区部队，对全军干部战士最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！这个号召，对于我军完成“三支”“两军”和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务，对于部队革命化建设，对于推动全军、全国活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，具有极为重大的指导意义和深远的影响。我们要热烈响应，认真学习领会，坚决贯彻执行。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“不要吃老本，要立新功”。当前，我军肩负着“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。这是毛主席对我军的最大信任，也是对我们每支部队、每个同志的严峻考验。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，永葆革命青春，不断为人民立新功。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功，最主要的就是要坚定不移地、毫不含糊地、满腔热情地支持无产阶级革命派，支持他们夺权、掌权、用权，支持他们的一切革命行动，在任何情况下都要作他们的坚强后盾。支左的工作做得越好，为人民立的新功就越多，越大。我军全体指战员都要下定决心，把支左工作做得好上加好。
    我们执行这样崭新的重大历史任务，犯些错误是不奇怪的。错了就要痛痛快快地承认，公开检讨，迅速彻底地改正。决不要羞羞答答，吞吞吐吐。错误改正了，同样能够为人民立新功。我们要象林副主席教导的那样，既要把自己作为革命的一份力量，同时，又要不断地把自己作为革命的对象。不懂得的事情，不知道怎样做的工作，就向毛主席请教，努力活学活用毛主席著作。我们要在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，牢固地树立起无产阶级世界观，永远做人民的忠实勤务员，乘风破浪，不断前进。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无论过去、现在和将来，都是指引我们从胜利走向胜利的灯塔。我们要在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功，最根本的，就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地支持和保护无产阶级革命派。毛泽东思想，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们行动的指南，是一切工作的指导方针。我们要坚决照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想去观察处理一切问题。要认真学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政的条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。在斗争中学，在斗争中用。自觉地学，自觉地用。凡是毛主席说的，我们就坚决照办，坚决执行。理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行。凡是违背毛主席指示，违反毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决抵制，坚决斗争。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就坚决打倒谁。我们要高举毛泽东思想的批判大旗，和无产阶级革命派一起，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿猛烈开火，坚决把他们打翻在地，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，肃清他们的流毒，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。
    我们誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫林副主席，誓死保卫中央文革小组，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功！　（八月十一日）
