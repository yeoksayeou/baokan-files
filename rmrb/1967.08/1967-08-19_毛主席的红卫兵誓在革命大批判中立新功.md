Millions of revolutionary youths celebrate the glorious anniversary of the Red Guards, recognizing the new situation in the Cultural Revolution

Chairman Mao's Red Guards pledge to achieve new victories in the revolutionary criticism campaign.

The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution today is completely different from that of a year ago. At that time, it was necessary to conduct a nationwide revolutionary tour to spread the revolutionary spirit and ignite the revolutionary fire. In the current situation, continuing with large-scale tours would be a mistake. Now, it is necessary to carry out deep revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on August 18, today marks the first anniversary of the day when our most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao, received the nation's million Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the capital for the first time. On this day of great historical significance, from the coast of the East China Sea to the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains, from the south of the Yangtze River to the north of the Great Wall, celebrations are taking place everywhere across the country. Over the past year, the millions of Red Guards who have made great achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are filled with boundless excitement and fighting spirit. They are holding rallies and parades to celebrate this glorious day of the Red Guards.

The Red Guards and workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places, reviewing the victorious battle journey of the past year, are all deeply moved and express their determination: We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that the proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all of humanity, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Everyone recognizes that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution today is completely different from that of a year ago. At that time, it was necessary to conduct a nationwide revolutionary tour to spread the revolutionary spirit and ignite the revolutionary fire. In the current situation, continuing with large-scale tours would be a mistake. Now, it is necessary to carry out deep revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. Everyone expresses their determination: We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, strive to be models of revolutionary criticism, models of promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, models of seizing revolution and promoting production, and models of resuming classes and making revolution. We will create new achievements in thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters and completing the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation!

The Red Guards in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, Qinghai, and other places, as well as the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are filled with boundless love, respect, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. They are welcoming the glorious anniversary of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards. People at the celebrations and demonstrations are shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The leaders of the revolutionary committees of various provinces and cities and the military all attended the local celebrations to express their warm congratulations. Wang Xiaoyu, the head of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and Yang Dezhi, the head of the Jinan Military Region, Li Zaicheng, the deputy political commissar of the Kunming Military Region, the first political commissar of the Guizhou Military Region, and the head of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Jianglin, the first deputy head of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all spoke at local celebrations.

In the birthplace of the great Red Guard movement, Beijing, the Red Guards gathered at the Great Hall of the People this evening to celebrate this glorious and happy day. The meeting read a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. Representatives of the Red Revolutionary Committees of universities and middle schools in the capital expressed at the meeting that they must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, work hard and diligently, and in the revolutionary criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, better realize and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. They will create new achievements in thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters! Representatives of the Workers' Congress, the Peasants' Congress, and the revolutionary masses of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing also attended to congratulate.

In the evening, the Red Guards held a grand rally. The revolutionary youths reviewed the past year of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, climbing peaks, and facing storms. They said: Carrying the revolutionary criticism movement to the end is a matter of great importance for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years. This is also the glorious historical task given to us Red Guards by the great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary youths expressed: The Red Guards in Shanghai must listen to Chairman Mao's words and be models of revolutionary great unity. We must "make revolution on the spot" and "resume classes and make revolution." We must sit down and seriously study Chairman Mao's works, think more, and think deeply, using Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism and complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. We must do a good job of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the unit and the region, which is also the greatest support for the revolutionary masses in other places.
