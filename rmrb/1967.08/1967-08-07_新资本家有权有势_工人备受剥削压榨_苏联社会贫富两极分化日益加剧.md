Editor's Note: During the era of Tsarist Russia, countless revolutionaries sacrificed their lives to overthrow the system of exploitation and oppression. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party founded by Lenin, the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution was finally achieved, marking the first time in human history that the working people became the masters of the state.

Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet working people abolished the private ownership of the means of production, burying the days when landlords and capitalists ruled and workers and peasants were exploited and enslaved.

However, since the revisionist clique of Khrushchev seized the party and government powers, this group of traitors representing the new and old bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union has dragged the country onto the path of capitalist restoration. Their series of reactionary measures have led to drastic changes in class relations, resulting in significant wealth disparities in Soviet society. With the support of the Soviet revisionist clique, a new group of bourgeois elements has emerged, forming a privileged bourgeois class that oppresses and exploits the broad masses of working people. The Soviet working people have once again become slaves of the new exploiting class, experiencing the same hardships as before the October Revolution.

The Soviet revisionist clique, under the banner of "building communism," propagandizes the so-called "all-people's state," precisely to cover up the restoration of capitalism, to cover up class exploitation and oppression, and to cover up bourgeois dictatorship.

Lenin said: "The fundamental question of every revolution is the question of state power."

The lessons of the Soviet Union once again clearly tell us that when the working people's power is usurped by traitors of the proletariat, being masters of the house becomes an empty phrase, and the fruits of the revolution will be lost. We believe that the Soviet people, rich in glorious revolutionary traditions, will surely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists, seize back the power, and reclaim the great achievements of the October Revolution that were squandered by them!

New Capitalists Hold Power and Privilege, Workers Suffer Exploitation and Oppression
Soviet Society Faces Increasing Wealth Disparity

Since Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they have continued Khrushchev's legacy, issuing a series of decrees and regulations to expand the interests of the Soviet revisionist bourgeois privileged class, transforming state-owned enterprises and farms into the property of the privileged class. The leaders of Soviet enterprises, such as factory directors and managers, have become genuine new-style capitalists. The broad masses of Soviet workers are once again being exploited and enslaved. The wealth disparity in Soviet society is becoming increasingly pronounced and severe.

High Salaries and Bonuses

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has always implemented a high salary and high bonus system for enterprise leaders. However, the so-called "Regulations on Socialist State-Owned Production Enterprises" issued in 1965 further granted enterprises the privilege of "self-determining" salaries, bonuses, and wage funds. Therefore, the salaries of the privileged have increased even more. For example, according to regulations, the salary of a chief engineer should be 560 rubles, but the chief engineer of a plastic products factory in Russia earns 1,400 rubles per month. More seriously, the privileged often hold multiple jobs and receive double salaries. According to the *Soviet Russia* newspaper, many leaders of the Makhachkala Food Industry Research Institute hold honorary positions as chief engineers and chief brewers in enterprises without actually working, all receiving double salaries.

The numerous bonuses are also a significant source of income for the privileged. The higher the salary, the more bonuses. According to the *Pravda* and *Trud* newspapers, the manager of a Lipetsk industrial construction trust cleverly received bonuses totaling 1,400 rubles seven times in one month. The director of a construction and installation management bureau received bonuses seventeen times in one year. The Gomel Glass Factory distributed bonuses to management personnel amounting to 147.2% of their salary in one quarter, while the workers received nothing.

Additionally, the new regulations also stipulated high additional salaries. It was stipulated that enterprise leaders and engineering and technical personnel could receive an additional 30% of their position salary.

Extravagant Privileged Class

The privileged class lives a life of luxury and indulgence, using the wealth they exploit and plunder from the people. According to the *Soviet Russia* newspaper, the office of the director of the Moscow Commercial Administration is as luxurious as a "palace," with high-quality carpets, sculpted ceilings, exquisitely decorated chandeliers, and redwood wall panels. Currently, in the Soviet Union, there are many privileged individuals who have cars, televisions, refrigerators, villas, servants, and drivers at home. The leaders of the Estonian uranium plant not only have televisions, refrigerators, carpets, and cars but also have villas and beautiful seaside resorts built exclusively for themselves.

Arbitrary Punishment and Dismissal of Workers

The heads of Soviet enterprises and farms treat workers as slaves, establishing arbitrary punishment regulations and dismissing workers at will.

The director of the "Victors" farm in Kirov Oblast issued 223 punishment orders against workers in one year, punishing 125 people and issuing 350 orders for material responsibility. The director of a pig fattening station in Kiev was out all night drinking with friends and did not return. The driver, anxious, only said, "I need to rest," and the next day, the director dismissed him on the grounds of "reducing the workforce." The director of the "Silene" farm in Latvia illegally dismissed fifteen workers at once. The director of the "Lezekne" farm dismissed sixteen people at once. A young tractor driver in a farm in Tambov Oblast was slapped and beaten with shoes by the director for resting for a while due to illness.

Workers Deprived of the Right to Speak

Since the Soviet revisionists seized power, the broad masses of Soviet workers have been deprived of democratic rights, even the right to speak.

An old Soviet worker complained that now in the Soviet Union, "workers have no right to speak. If a worker expresses legitimate dissatisfaction with the leadership, they will be discriminated against, suppressed, and harassed by the leadership, making it impossible for them to stay in the factory, even leading to dismissal. If a worker is dismissed, they cannot find work elsewhere. Therefore, in such a situation, workers have to endure the pain of 'voluntarily' leaving the factory before being dismissed."

### 新资本家有权有势　工人备受剥削压榨  苏联社会贫富两极分化日益加剧

    编者按　在沙皇俄国时代，为了推翻剥削和压迫制度，无数革命者抛头颅，洒热血，前赴后继地进行英勇的斗争。在列宁缔造的布尔什维克党的领导下，终于取得了十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，无产阶级劳动人民在人类历史上破天荒第一次作了国家的主人。
    苏联劳动人民在列宁和斯大林领导下，消灭了生产资料的私有制，地主资本家横行霸道，工人农民受剥削、遭奴役的日子被埋葬了！
    但是，自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了党政大权以来，这伙代表苏联新旧资产阶级的工贼，就把国家拉上了复辟资本主义的轨道。他们采取的一系列反动的措施，引起了阶级关系的急剧变化，使苏联社会发生了显著的贫富两极分化。在苏修集团的扶植下，一批新的资产阶级分子产生了，形成了一个资产阶级特权阶层，压迫和剥削广大的劳动人民。苏联的劳动人民又沦为新的剥削阶级的奴隶。他们同十月革命前一样，正在吃第二遍苦。
    苏修集团打起所谓“建设共产主义”的招牌，宣扬什么“全民国家”，正是为了掩饰资本主义的复辟，掩饰阶级剥削和阶级压迫，掩饰资产阶级专政。
    列宁说：“一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题。”
    苏联的教训再一次清楚地告诉我们，当劳动人民的印把子被无产阶级的叛徒篡夺了以后，当家作主就成了空话，革命成果就会丧失。我们相信，富于光荣革命传统的苏联人民，一定会起来造苏修的反，把权夺回来，把被他们断送的伟大十月革命的成果夺回来！
    新资本家有权有势　工人备受剥削压榨
    苏联社会贫富两极分化日益加剧
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台以来，继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，颁布了一系列法令、条例来扩大苏修资产阶级特权阶层的利益，使全民所有制的企业、农场蜕变为特权阶层所有。苏联企业领导人，诸如厂长、经理之流，已变成了货真价实的新型资本家。苏联广大工人重新被剥削、被奴役。苏联社会向贫富两极分化日益显著和加剧。
    高额的工资和奖金
    苏修统治集团对企业的负责人，本来实行的就是高工资、高奖金制度。可是，一九六五年颁布的所谓“社会主义国营生产企业条例”，又规定企业有“自定”工资、奖金和工资基金的特权，因此，特权者们的工资更是高上加高了。例如，按规定总工程师的工薪应是五百六十卢布，但俄罗斯一个塑料制品工厂总工程师每月工资竟高达一千四百卢布。更严重的是特权者兼职还拿双薪。据《苏维埃俄罗斯报》透露，麦哈契卡林食品工业科学研究院许多领导人在企业中兼任不上班的挂名总工程师、总酿造师等职，都拿双份工资。
    名目繁多的奖金也是特权者们的一项大财源。工资越高，奖金越多。据《真理报》、《劳动报》透露，利佩茨克一工业建筑托拉斯经理一个月内就巧妙地七次获奖金一千四百卢布。一建筑安装管理局主任一年就捞到十七次奖金。戈米尔玻璃工厂一个季度发给管理人员的奖金就占他们薪金额的百分之一百四十七点二，而工人却分文未得。
    此外，新条例还规定了高额的附加工资。规定企业领导人和工程技术人员可得职务工资百分之三十的附加工资。
    穷奢极欲的特权者
    特权者们用剥削、搜刮来的民脂民膏过着花天酒地的生活。据《苏维埃俄罗斯报》透露，莫斯科商业总管理局局长的办公室如同“宫殿”一般富丽堂皇，有高级地毯、雕塑装饰的天花板、极其精致的镶花边的吊架灯、红木的护墙板。目前在苏联，家里有小汽车、电视机、电冰箱、别墅、佣人和汽车司机的特权者多得很。爱沙尼亚铀工厂领导人不但有电视机、电冰箱、地毯、小汽车，而且还专为他们自己修建了别墅和漂亮的海滨浴场。
    随意处罚解雇工人
    苏联企业、农场的头头们把工人当奴隶看待，可以随心所欲私立惩罚条例，任意解雇工人。
    基尔罗伏州“胜利者”农场场长一年内竟颁布了二百二十三项对工人的惩罚令，处罚了一百二十五人，对三百五十人下了追究物质责任的命令。基辅州一养猪肥育站主任因整夜在朋友家吃喝玩乐不走，汽车司机等急了，只说了一句“我该休息了”的话，第二天这位主任就以“压缩编制”为由解雇了他。拉脱维亚“锡连涅”农场场长一次就非法解雇十五名工人。而“列泽克涅”农场场长一次解雇了十六人。唐波夫州某农场一青年拖拉机手因病躺下休息了一会，竟挨了场长一顿耳光和皮鞋的毒打。
    工人被剥夺发言权
    苏修篡夺政权以来，苏联广大工人被剥夺了民主权利，甚至连发言权都没有。
    一位苏联老工人控诉说，现在苏联“工人根本没有权利讲话。工人对领导表示正当的不满，就会遭到领导歧视、压制和刁难，使他在厂里呆不下去，甚至开除。如果工人被开除了，到别的地方是找不到工作的。因此，碰到这种情况，工人就得在开除前，忍痛提出‘自愿’退厂。”
