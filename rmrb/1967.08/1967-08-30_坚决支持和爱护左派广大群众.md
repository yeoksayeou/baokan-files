The great leader Chairman Mao's great directive that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left is a glorious strategic task given to our army, and it is the guiding principle for our "three supports" and "two military" work. Resolutely supporting the broad masses of the left is the main content of our army's work to serve the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is the greatest way to serve the people.

Chairman Mao said: "We must train a large number of people. These people are the vanguard of the revolution. These people have political foresight. These people are full of fighting spirit and spirit of sacrifice. These people are open-hearted, loyal, active, and upright. These people do not seek personal gain, but only strive for the liberation of the nation and society. These people are not afraid of difficulties, and in the face of difficulties, they are always firm and brave to move forward. These people are not arrogant, nor are they opportunists, but are down-to-earth and rich in practical spirit. China needs a large group of such vanguard elements, and the tasks of the Chinese revolution can be smoothly accomplished."

Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, and in the surging mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of revolutionaries who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have emerged and will continue to emerge. They are the vanguard and backbone of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a precious asset of our great motherland, and the hope for the victory of socialism and communism.

The revolutionary left represents the will of the broad masses of the people, represents the interests of the broad masses of the people, and represents the direction of social progress. To serve the broadest masses of the people, we must firmly stand on the side of the proletariat, firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary left. Only by resolutely supporting, cherishing, and helping the left, developing and strengthening the leftist forces, and relying on them to unite all forces that can be united, can we successfully complete the great strategic task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary left is the new revolutionary backbone of the proletariat. Historically, new and correct things are often weak and in the minority at the beginning. However, new forces are invincible and will ultimately win because they are growing, strengthening, and advancing. The facts of the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully prove this revolutionary dialectic.

The revolutionary left is the faithful executor and brave defender of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with their lives and blood. They represent the long-term and fundamental interests of the vast majority of people, and they represent the truth of the revolution. Whether they are in the majority or temporarily in the minority, we must support them. The more they are in the minority, the more we must stand up and firmly stand by their side, and resolutely, unhesitatingly, and unshakably support them with all our might. Only in this way can we truly and thoroughly serve the people and truly serve the people.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is inevitable that the revolutionary left will have some shortcomings and mistakes. The revolutionary left is precisely growing in the stormy waves of class struggle, gaining experience both positively and negatively, and advancing continuously. Chairman Mao teaches us to look at the essence and the main trend of things. We should see that the essence of the revolutionary left is their limitless love for Chairman Mao and their limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct their spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have made tremendous contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and this is their main trend. Of course, "any mistake is not in the interests of the people." For the shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary left, we must "truly stand on the side of the people, speak with the ardent passion of protecting and educating the people," and help them correct them. This is the correct attitude towards revolutionary masses, a manifestation of being responsible for the interests of the people, and also a way of cherishing the revolutionary left. We must not, because the revolutionary left has shortcomings and mistakes, fail to see their direction, and not resolutely support them.

In places where there are two revolutionary mass organizations, we must firmly support them with Mao Zedong Thought, promote their revolutionary great unity. For both sides, whatever is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we support; whatever is not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we do not support, and we help them get on the track of proletarian revolution. In such cases, we must always pay attention to not supporting one side without principles and suppressing and oppressing the other side.

We resolutely support the leftist masses, and at the same time, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we must pay attention to the work of some deceived masses. We must carry out meticulous political and ideological work, and we must not adopt a simple and rough attitude. We ourselves must do this, and we must also persuade and educate the leftist masses to do this.

For the problems and differences between the revolutionary left and the supporting troops, we must handle them according to Chairman Mao's thought: both sides must carry out open, mass self-criticism, and deal with their own shortcomings and mistakes. For the other side, when necessary, we can also raise opinions, but we must follow Chairman Mao's correct principles for handling contradictions among the people, and adopt appropriate methods that are conducive to unity and conducive to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this regard, our comrades in the army must set an example of self-criticism and be a good example of maintaining military-civilian unity.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must unite closely with all proletarian revolutionaries, with all the revolutionary Red Guards, and with all revolutionary masses! We must launch a more extensive and enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 坚决支持和爱护左派广大群众

    坚决支持和爱护左派广大群众
    伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大教导，给我军提出了光荣的战略任务，是我们“三支”“两军”工作的行动指南。坚决支持左派广大群众，是无产阶级文化大革命中我军爱民的主要内容，是最大的爱民。
    毛主席说：“要造就一大批人，这些人是革命的先锋队。这些人具有政治的远见。这些人充满着斗争精神与牺牲精神。这些人是胸怀坦白的，忠诚的，积极的，与正直的。这些人不谋私利，唯一的为着民族与社会的解放。这些人不怕困难，在困难面前总是坚定的，勇敢向前的。这些人不是狂妄分子，也不是风头主义者，而是脚踏实地富于实际精神的人们。中国要有一大群这样的先锋分子，中国革命的任务就能够顺利的解决。”
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在无产阶级文化大革命的汹涌澎湃的群众运动中，已经涌现出并将继续涌现出大批忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级革命派。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋分子和骨干力量，是我们伟大祖国的宝贵财富，是社会主义和共产主义胜利的希望。
    革命左派，代表着广大人民群众的意志，代表着广大人民群众的利益，代表着社会前进的方向。我们要为最广大的人民服务，就必须坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，坚定地站在革命左派的立场上。只有坚决地支持左派，爱护左派，帮助左派，发展和壮大左派队伍，并且依靠他们把一切可以团结的力量都团结起来，才能胜利完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略任务。
    革命左派，是无产阶级的新生革命骨干。历史上新的正确的东西，在开始的时候常常是弱小的，常常是占少数。但是，新生力量是不可战胜的，归根到底是要胜利的，因为它在成长着，壮大着，前进着。无产阶级文化大革命一年来的事实，充分证明了这个革命的辩证法。
    革命左派，是毛主席革命路线的忠实执行者和勇敢捍卫者，他们用生命和鲜血保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们代表了绝大多数人的长远利益和根本利益，代表了革命的真理。不管他们是处于多数还是暂时的少数，我们都要支持他们。他们越是处于少数地位，我们越要挺身而出，坚定地站在他们一边，毫不含糊、毫不犹豫、毫不动摇地全力支持他们。这样，才是真正地完全彻底为人民服务，真正的爱民。
    革命左派在这场举世无双的无产阶级文化大革命中，产生一些缺点和错误是难免的。革命左派正是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长的，在取得正面和反面的经验中增长才干、不断前进的。毛主席教导我们，看问题要看本质，看主流。我们应当看到革命左派的本质是无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们对无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献，这是他们的主流。当然，“任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的”。对于革命左派的缺点错误，我们“必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”，帮助他们改正。这是对待革命群众的正确态度，是对人民利益负责的表现，也是对革命左派的爱护。我们决不能因为革命左派有缺点错误，就看不清他们的大方向，就不坚决支持他们。
    在存在着两派革命群众组织的地方，我们要坚定地用毛泽东思想支援他们，促进他们实现革命的大联合。对于两派，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就支持，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就不支持，就帮助他们走上无产阶级革命的轨道。遇到这样的情况，要随时注意绝不能无原则地支持一派，打击和压制另一派。
    我们坚决支持左派群众，同时还要根据毛主席的指示，注意做受蒙蔽的一些群众的工作。进行细致的政治思想工作，而不能采取简单粗暴的态度。我们自己要这样做，还要说服教育左派群众也这样做。
    对于革命左派和支左部队之间的一些问题和分歧，一定要按照毛主席的思想：双方面各自实行公开的、群众性的自我批评，处理自己发生过的缺点和错误。对待他方面，在必要时也可以提意见，但必须按照毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，采取适当的有利于团结、有利于无产阶级文化大革命的方式。在这方面，我们军队的同志，一定要作自我批评的模范，要作维护军民团结的好样子。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指导下，我人民解放军的全体指战员，同一切无产阶级革命派紧密团结起来，同一切红卫兵革命小将，一切革命群众团结起来！更大规模地展开一个热烈的拥军爱民运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
                                              （八月三十日）
