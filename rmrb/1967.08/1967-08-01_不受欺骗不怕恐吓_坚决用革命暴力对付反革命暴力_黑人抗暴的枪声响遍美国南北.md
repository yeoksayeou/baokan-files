The intensifying black resistance struggles in the United States since the beginning of summer this year are continuing to develop. Despite the suppression, threats, and deceptions of the Johnson administration, more cities across the country have seen black people take up arms in recent days, engaging in brave struggles of self-defense.

Johnson, whose hands are still stained with the blood of the massacres in Newark and Detroit, hypocritically went to a church on the 30th to "pray for peace and reconciliation." However, this did not deceive the awakening black people of the United States: on the very day Johnson declared a "National Day of Prayer for Peace and Reconciliation," from the northern city of Milwaukee in Wisconsin to the southern city of Levee Riva in Florida, the sounds of black people's retaliatory gunfire echoed once again.

In Milwaukee, several hundred protesting black people used self-defense weapons and bricks to engage in an all-night fierce struggle with the armed police conducting the suppression. Despite the police's mad arrests and injuring of over forty black people, the protesters fearlessly fought back, killing and injuring seven police officers, smashing multiple police cars, and setting fire to many white supremacist shops. The struggle continued until the morning of the 31st. The reactionary authorities cried out that the situation was severe, hurriedly dispatching 1,600 National Guardsmen to suppress the struggle, declaring a "state of emergency" and implementing a curfew; at the same time, they sent an emergency report to Johnson.

On the same day, about a thousand black people in Levee Riva protested against arbitrary arrests by the police and clashed with the police in a large-scale conflict. The police used tear gas against the increasingly gathering black protesters, and the black people fired back at the police and threw Molotov cocktails; the Molotov cocktails started a fire.

In Portland, Oregon, and Wichita, Kansas, hundreds of people participated in black struggles yesterday. The mayor of Portland admitted that the local situation was "very serious." The authorities in Wichita have declared a "state of emergency."

The day before, in Elk Grove, Illinois, St. Louis, Newburgh, New York, Hamilton, Ohio, and many other cities, black struggles of varying scales also broke out.

The surging black struggles, especially the armed resistance struggles, have made the American ruling class anxious. Michigan Governor Romney, recalling the recent large-scale armed resistance struggle in Detroit, said with lingering fear: "Unless appropriate measures are taken, this country may fall into a domestic guerrilla war in the coming years." He anxiously pointed out that currently, the "moderate leaders" in the black movement have very little support, and "more and more black people are listening to and supporting" the "belligerent revolutionary elements" who "advocate violence and rebellion," and these people "are arming themselves and organizing for this purpose." He said, "We should not overlook this serious fact." New York City Mayor Lindsay also anxiously said that the thriving black struggles are "the number one problem facing America today, and there is no temporary solution to this, nor is there a quick answer."

### 不受欺骗不怕恐吓　坚决用革命暴力对付反革命暴力  黑人抗暴的枪声响遍美国南北

    不受欺骗不怕恐吓　坚决用革命暴力对付反革命暴力
    黑人抗暴的枪声响遍美国南北
    新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：今年入夏以来急剧高涨的美国黑人抗暴斗争，正继续发展中；不顾约翰逊政府的镇压、威胁和欺骗，连日来，美国又有更多城市的黑人拿起武器，进行了英勇的暴力自卫斗争。
    残暴屠杀纽瓦克和底特律黑人的约翰逊，手上血迹未干，三十日，却假仁假义地跑到教堂去“祈祷和平与和解”。然而，这并没有骗得了正在觉醒中的美国黑人：就在约翰逊宣布为“全国祈祷和平与和解日”的这一天，从北部的威斯康星州的密尔沃基到南部佛罗里达州的列维埃腊滩等城市，又响起了黑人复仇的枪声。
    在密尔沃基市，几百名示威黑人用自卫枪支和砖头石块同进行镇压的武装警察进行了通宵的激烈搏斗。尽管警察疯狂进行逮捕，并打伤了四十多名黑人，但示威黑人不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，进行了针锋相对的斗争，打死打伤了七名警察，砸坏了多辆警车，并且放火烧了许多白人种族主义者的店铺。斗争一直坚持到三十一日上午还在进行。反动当局惊呼局势严重，一面赶忙派出一千六百名国民警卫队进行镇压，一面宣布“紧急状态”，实行宵禁；同时，向约翰逊告急。
    同一天，列维埃腊滩约一千名黑人，因为抗议警察任意逮捕，也同警察发生了大规模冲突。警察用催泪弹对付越聚越多的示威黑人，黑人便向警察开枪，扔燃烧弹；燃烧弹引起了大火。
    在俄勒冈州的波特兰市和堪萨斯州的维契塔市昨天也爆发了有数百人参加的黑人斗争。波特兰市市长承认当地局势“十分严重”。维契塔市当局已经宣布“紧急戒严”。
    在这前一天，伊利诺斯州的埃尔京和圣路易、纽约州的新堡、俄亥俄州的汉密尔顿等许多城市，也爆发了规模不等的黑人斗争。
    风起云涌的黑人斗争，特别是武装抗暴斗争，使美国统治集团惶惶不安。密执安州州长罗姆尼三十日在回顾底特律最近爆发的空前规模的黑人武装抗暴斗争时，心有余悸地说：“除非采取适当的措施，否则，在今后几年中，这个国家可能陷入一场国内游击战争中”。他不安地指出，目前，黑人运动中的“温和派领导”很少得到支持，“越来越多的黑人正在倾听和支持”那些“宣传暴力和造反”的“好战的革命分子”，而这些人“正在为此目的武装起来”和进行组织工作。他说：“我们不应该忽视这种严重的事实”。纽约市市长林赛也惴惴不安地说，蓬勃开展的黑人斗争是“美国今天面临的头号问题，而且，对此没有什么暂时性的解决办法，也没有迅速的答案。”
