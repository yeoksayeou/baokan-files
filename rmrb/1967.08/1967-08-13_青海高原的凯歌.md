The Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Province, under the warm care of our great leader Chairman Mao, in the midst of the excellent situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and in the high tide of the thorough smashing and struggle against the bourgeois headquarters, has been established. This is a new great victory in the struggle for power seizure by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat since the "January Revolution" storm. This is a triumphant song of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao on the Qinghai Plateau.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province, with the "August 18" leftist organizations as the core, has undergone a severe test of intense and tense class struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Party. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army in the Qinghai region, and in some difficult days, they braved the resistance and surged forward against the waves. Finally, they seized the power of party, government, finance, and culture from the hands of the class enemies. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province is indeed a steel soldier loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is the brave defender of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and the strongest pillar of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. The People's Liberation Army in the Qinghai region has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely and unconditionally executed all the instructions of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. They have clearly supported and protected the proletarian revolutionary faction. The People's Liberation Army in the Qinghai region has played a major role in the struggle for power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Qinghai Province has experienced setbacks. This seems to be a bad thing, but in fact, it is a good thing. Because of this, the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie has been more exposed, the revolutionary side has shown itself, and the lines have been clearly drawn. The law of things is often like this: under certain conditions, bad things turn into good things. Through setbacks, the problems are seen clearly and solved. The more contradictions are fully exposed, the more thoroughly they are solved. The situation in Qinghai is exactly like this.

The experience of the power seizure struggle by the proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province once again proves that as long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will be invincible.

The experience of Qinghai tells us that firmly implementing the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction is the most important guarantee for the victory of the power seizure struggle. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province achieved a revolutionary great alliance in the power seizure struggle and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance in the revolutionary great criticism. This ensured that their power seizure struggle had a solid mass base and ideological base.

The experience of Qinghai tells us that implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the power seizure struggle by the proletarian revolutionary faction. Chairman Mao said: "In places and units where power seizure is needed, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is good to be called the Revolutionary Committee." The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province formed a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the power seizure struggle and consolidated the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the revolutionary great criticism. This ensured that the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Province became a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat.

The experience of Qinghai tells us that at any time, we must firmly grasp the grand direction of the struggle, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, launch a great criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who are the biggest. This great criticism and struggle cannot be relaxed in promoting the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," cannot be relaxed in the power seizure struggle, and cannot be relaxed in the process of seizing and using power. Only in this way can the proletarian dictatorship be consolidated and strengthened, and the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat be carried out to the end.

The experience of Qinghai tells us that the core role of revolutionary leading cadres must be fully played. In the power seizure struggle of Qinghai Province, a group of revolutionary leading cadres stood out and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fighting together with the proletarian revolutionary faction. They further revealed themselves in the revolutionary great criticism. Chairman Mao said: "Old cadres have merits in the past, but they cannot rely on their past merits. They must be well tempered and transformed in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and establish new merits and new labor." The revolutionary cadres of Qinghai Province are exactly following Chairman Mao's instructions.

The experience of Qinghai tells us that in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the policies of the Central Committee of the Party must be modelly executed. Winning over and educating the deceived masses, helping them to turn around quickly, and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is an important policy of the Party. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province did not practice everyone passing the test or retaliatory strikes against the deceived masses. Instead, with a responsible attitude towards the revolution and the people, they patiently and meticulously helped and educated the deceived masses one by one, so that they raised their consciousness in the great exposure, accusation, criticism, and struggle, turned against the enemy, and jointly fought against the enemy.

The situation in Qinghai is excellent and getting better and better. The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Province marks that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Qinghai Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, has entered a new great journey. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Qinghai Province must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the most important position, and in seizing the power of the capitalist-roaders, also seize the power of the "self" in their minds, and achieve the revolutionization of thought. Only in this way can they hold and use power for the proletariat, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat better, creating a new Qinghai that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 青海高原的凯歌

    青海高原的凯歌
    青海省革命委员会，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，在亿万革命群众彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的大批判大斗争高潮中，宣告成立了。这是“一月革命”风暴以来无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个新的伟大胜利。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在青海高原上的一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    青海省以“八·一八”左派组织为核心的无产阶级革命派，为了从青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权，经历了激烈、紧张的阶级搏斗的严峻考验。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在青海地区人民解放军的大力支持和协助下，曾经在一些艰苦日子里，顶着阻力行，迎着风浪上，终于从阶级敌人手中，把党、政、财、文大权胜利地夺了过来。青海省无产阶级革命派，不愧为忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的钢铁战士。
    毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，是无产阶级文化大革命的英勇保卫者，是无产阶级革命派的强大后盾，是我国无产阶级专政最坚强的柱石。青海地区的人民解放军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席一边，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切指示，旗帜鲜明地支持和保护无产阶级革命派。青海地区的人民解放军，在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中起了重大的作用。
    青海省的无产阶级文化大革命，曾经出现了反复。这看起来仿佛是坏事，实际上是大好事。因为这样一来，资产阶级反动路线更加暴露了，革命方面也表现出来了，阵线分明了。事情的规律往往是这样，在一定的条件下，坏事变成了好事。经过反复，问题就看清楚了，就解决了。矛盾越是充分暴露，就解决得越彻底。青海的事情就正是这样。
    青海省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的经验再一次证明，只要我们遵照毛主席的指示办事，就能无往而不胜。
    青海的经验告诉我们，坚决实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，是夺权斗争取得胜利的最重要的保证。青海省无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中实现了革命的大联合，又在革命的大批判中巩固了革命的大联合。这就保证了他们的夺权斗争，有着坚实的群众基础和思想基础。
    青海的经验告诉我们，实行革命的“三结合”，是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争取得胜利的政治保证和组织保证。毛主席说：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”青海省无产阶级革命派，在夺权斗争中形成了革命的“三结合”，又在革命的大批判中巩固了革命的“三结合”。这就保证了青海省革命委员会，成为革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。
    青海的经验告诉我们，在任何时候，都要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，从政治上、思想上、理论上对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判、大斗争。这种大批判、大斗争，在推进革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”的时候不能放松，在夺权斗争中不能放松，在掌权和用权的过程中也不能放松。只有这样，才能巩固和加强无产阶级专政，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    青海的经验告诉我们，要充分发挥革命的领导干部的核心骨干作用。在青海省的夺权斗争中，一批革命的领导干部站了出来，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同无产阶级革命派战斗在一起。他们在革命的大批判中，进一步亮了相。毛主席说：“老干部过去有功劳，但是不能靠吃老本，要很好地在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼改造自己，要立新功，立新劳。”青海省的革命干部，正是按照毛主席这个教导做的。
    青海的经验告诉我们，在无产阶级文化大革命中，要模范地执行党中央的政策。争取、教育受蒙蔽的群众，帮助他们转变过来，迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，这是党的一项重要政策。青海的无产阶级革命派，对受蒙蔽的群众，不搞人人过关，不搞打击报复。而是以对革命负责、对人民负责的态度，耐心细致地、一个一个地帮助教育受蒙蔽的群众，使他们在大揭发、大控诉、大批判、大斗争中提高觉悟，反戈一击，共同对敌。
    青海的形势大好，而且越来越好。青海省革命委员会的成立，标志着青海省无产阶级文化大革命在毛主席所开辟的航道上，进入了新的伟大的航程。青海省的无产阶级革命派一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作放在头等重要的地位，在夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，狠夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，实现思想的革命化。这样，才能为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，才能把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，创造出一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红彤彤的新青海。
