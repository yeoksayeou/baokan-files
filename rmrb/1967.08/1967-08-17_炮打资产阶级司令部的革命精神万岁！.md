One year ago, at the historic Party's Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenary Session, our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, issued a great battle call: Bombard the Headquarters of the Bourgeoisie!

Chairman Mao's big-character poster, "Bombard the Headquarters," is another great "signal gun" that opens a new era in human history. It is a powerful and limitless spiritual atomic bomb aimed at China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois headquarters headed by him. It is a declaration of war and a mobilization order for the proletariat to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the bourgeoisie. It is the great manifesto and the most powerful ideological weapon of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Under the great call of Chairman Mao's big-character poster, "Bombard the Headquarters," we, the children of Jinggangshan with a glorious tradition, under the great banner of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, have fought bravely on the banks of the Gan River. We have displayed the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," directly attacking the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, headed by China's Khrushchev, and his handful of agents in Jiangxi. We have engaged in a life-and-death struggle and decisive battle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. After more than a year of unyielding struggle, we have exposed China's Khrushchev's agents in Jiangxi, making them sink into the vast sea of people's war, and dealing a devastating blow to the bourgeois headquarters. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

At this solemn moment, one year after the historic Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenary Session, we, the children of Jinggangshan, are filled with fighting passion and victorious confidence, looking towards Beijing, and cannot help but shout from the bottom of our hearts a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

Our heroic children of Jinggangshan, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, and the Red Guards, are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, we have held high the revolutionary banner of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, standing at the forefront of the battle to bombard the bourgeois headquarters. Our cannons have always been aimed at the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and his handful of agents in Jiangxi, firing fiercely. Therefore, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party hate us to death and fear us to death. They stubbornly stand on the reactionary bourgeois position, using various vicious means to distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, encircle and suppress the revolutionary factions, and implement bourgeois dictatorship. They bully superiors and subordinates, act arrogantly, and use every means to tightly block Chairman Mao's voice. At the Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenary Session, they hypocritically declared: "Firmly support Chairman Mao's big-character poster, 'Bombard the Headquarters.'" But as soon as the ink dried, they tore off their masks and fiercely attacked and slandered Chairman Mao's big-character poster, "Bombard the Headquarters," directing their spears at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and brutally suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards. In those difficult days of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, they manipulated some conservative organizations to launch a large-scale attack on us, the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards. Whoever shouted the battle cry of "Bombard the Headquarters" was encircled, arrested, and beaten. Whoever stood on the side of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters was slandered as "monsters and demons." Many people were beaten down as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists." They created one shocking suppression incident after another, plotting large-scale work stoppages and production halts, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our heroic children of Jinggangshan, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, and the Red Guards, are heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are not afraid of high pressure and are not afraid of violence. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we are determined to protect the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, daring to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire, engaging in a head-on struggle with them. We broke through layer upon layer of encirclement and blockade, with millions of revolutionary big-character posters like arrows, shooting at the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly exposing their plots; at the same time, we overcame countless difficulties, went deep into the grassroots, and among the masses, propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, educating and winning over the deceived masses, isolating the handful of capitalist-roaders in power. Thus, after five months of arduous struggle, we finally raised high the revolutionary banner of Chairman Mao's bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, exposing one by one China's Khrushchev's agents in Jiangxi, making their ugly faces exposed in broad daylight. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi finally opened up a new situation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. We, the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards, according to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, riding the "January Revolution" wind, launching a power seizure struggle against the bourgeois headquarters. However, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party were not willing to accept their defeat. They used the tools of dictatorship to revive the already disintegrated conservative organizations, launching a new counterattack. In March, taking advantage of our proletarian revolutionaries' rectification opportunity, they imposed various unfounded charges on us, denied our correct direction, and suppressed us. In those days of white terror, we, the children of Jinggangshan, how we missed Chairman Mao! We sang with tears: "Looking up at the Big Dipper, thinking of Mao Zedong in my heart..." We held up the red book, reviewing the teachings of the great teacher about class struggle thousands of times. We summarized our experiences, straightened our ranks, firmed our resolve, revived our military might, and organized tens of millions of people into a vast army, forming an iron fist, directly striking at the handful of agents of the bourgeois headquarters in Jiangxi.

A more intense struggle unfolded. The handful of agents of the bourgeois headquarters in Jiangxi used more vicious means, together with some bad leaders they manipulated in the conservative organizations, plotting a large-scale counter-revolutionary encirclement against the proletarian revolutionaries. This is their desperate act. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The various oppressions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." In the face of severe class struggle, we, the children of Jinggangshan, passed the test, launching a heroic struggle. At the most difficult moment of the struggle, Chairman Mao sent us our comrades-in-arms—the great People's Liberation Army, units 6011 and 6810, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, giving us the strongest support and the firmest protection. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, who jumped the highest, also fell the hardest, ultimately lifting the stone that crushed their own feet. The revolutionary fire of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters burned more fiercely, and the revolutionary spirit of "Bombard the Headquarters" showed its boundless power.

In the past year, under the guidance of the revolutionary banner of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, we, the children of Jinggangshan, have formed a vast cultural revolution army, tempered by severe class struggle, and become even stronger. The revolutionary spirit of the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" inspires our struggle and also teaches us to constantly seize the power of the "self" in our minds, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, establishing a more thorough and unshakable proletarian great and unyielding revolutionary spirit. The great battle call of the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" keeps our cannons aimed at the bourgeois headquarters, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After more than a year of struggle, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, and the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev is crumbling. Currently, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has entered the stage of decisive battle. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." China's Khrushchev and his handful of agents in Jiangxi are still making their last desperate struggles, still looking for various opportunities to launch crazy counterattacks against the proletarian revolutionaries. We must not relax our vigilance and struggle.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raise higher the revolutionary banner of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, unite all possible forces, launch a new revolutionary high tide of great criticism and great struggle, concentrate our targets and forces, pursue victory, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, criticize and expose them thoroughly, completely destroying the bourgeois headquarters. In the great criticism of the revolution, achieve and consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and let Jiangxi, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, become a red world bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought!

    炮打资产阶级司令部的革命精神万岁！
    江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会
    一年前，在具有划时代意义的党的八届十一中全会上，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席发出了伟大的战斗号召：炮打资产阶级司令部！
    毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，是开辟人类历史新纪元的又一声伟大的“号炮”，是投向中国赫鲁晓夫和以他为首的资产阶级司令部的强大的、威力无穷的精神原子弹，是无产阶级向资产阶级发起全面反击的宣战书和动员令，是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领和最强大的思想武器！
    在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的伟大召唤下，我们具有光荣传统的井冈山儿女，在井冈山下，赣江两岸，高擎炮打资产阶级司令部的伟大战旗，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反精神，直捣暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其在江西的一小撮代理人，展开了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的一场生死大搏斗、大决战。经过一年多前赴后继的奋斗，我们揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人，使他们陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海，使资产阶级司令部又遭到一次毁灭性的打击。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    在具有伟大历史意义的八届十一中全会召开一周年的庄严时刻，我们井冈山的儿女满怀战斗的激情和胜利的信心，眺望北京，禁不住从心里千遍万遍地高呼：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    我们英雄的井冈山儿女，广大的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。文化大革命一开始，就高举炮打资产阶级司令部的革命大旗，站在炮打资产阶级司令部的第一线，炮口始终对准以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其在江西的一小撮代理人，猛烈开炮。因此，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对我们恨得要死，怕得要命。他们顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，采取种种毒辣手段，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，围剿革命派，实行资产阶级专政。他们欺上压下，胆大妄为，千方百计严密封锁毛主席的声音。在八届十一中全会上，他们假惺惺地表示：“坚决拥护毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报。”可是，墨迹未干，就扯下假面具，大肆攻击、污蔑毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，把矛头直接指向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，残酷镇压无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将。在那炮打资产阶级司令部的艰苦日子里，他们操纵一些保守组织，对我无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将大举围攻，谁要呼“炮打司令部”这一战斗口号，就围攻，就抓，就打，谁要站在炮打资产阶级司令部一边，就诬为“牛鬼蛇神”。多少人因此被打成“反革命”、“右派”。他们制造了一次又一次的骇人听闻的镇压事件，策划大规模停工停产，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命的烈火扑下去。
    我们英雄的井冈山儿女，广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，是毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄汉，不怕高压，不畏强暴，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫以毛主席为首的党中央，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，和他们展开了针锋相对的斗争。我们冲破重重围攻，层层封锁，以千万张革命的大字报，如同支支利箭，射向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底戳穿了他们的阴谋；同时，我们又克服重重困难，深入基层，深入群众，宣传毛主席的革命路线，教育争取受蒙蔽的群众，孤立了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。就这样，经过五个月的艰苦斗争，终于把毛主席炮打资产阶级司令部的革命大旗高高举起，把中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人一个个地揪了出来，使他们的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。江西的无产阶级文化大革命终于开创了新局面。
    毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬炮打资产阶级司令部的革命精神，乘“一月革命”的东风，向资产阶级司令部展开了夺权斗争。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不甘心他们的失败，他们动用专政工具，重新复活已经瓦解了的保守组织，进行新的反扑。三月间，趁我无产阶级革命派整风的机会给我们强加了种种莫须有的罪名，否定我们的大方向，对我们进行镇压。在那白色恐怖的日子里，我们井冈山儿女，多么想念毛主席啊！我们含着热泪高唱：“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东……”。我们捧出红彤彤的宝书，千遍万遍地重温伟大导师关于阶级斗争的教导，我们总结了经验，整齐了步伐，坚定了信心，重振军威，千万人又组织起浩浩荡荡的大军，捏成一个铁拳头，直向资产阶级司令部在江西的一小撮代理人打去。
    一场更加激烈的斗争展开了。资产阶级司令部在江西的一小撮代理人，施出更毒辣的手段，和他们一手操纵的保守组织的某些坏头头一起，对无产阶级革命派策划了大规模的反革命围剿。这是他们日暮途穷的表现。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”在严酷的阶级斗争面前，我们井冈山儿女经受住了严峻的考验，展开了英勇的斗争。在斗争最困难的时刻，毛主席派来了亲人——无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大的中国人民解放军六○一一、六八一○等英雄部队，给了无产阶级革命派最有力的支持，最坚强的保卫。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派跳得最高，也跌得最惨，到头来，搬起石头砸了自己的脚。炮打资产阶级司令部的革命烈火越烧越旺，“炮打司令部”的革命造反精神显示了无穷的威力。
    一年来，在炮打资产阶级司令部革命大旗的指引下，我们井冈山儿女组成了一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，经受住了严峻的阶级斗争的考验，锻炼得更加坚强。《炮打司令部》大字报的革命精神，鼓舞着我们的斗争，同时也教育我们要不断地夺头脑中“私”字的权，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，树立了更加彻底的、坚定不移的无产阶级大无畏的革命精神。《炮打司令部》大字报的伟大战斗号角，使我们炮口始终对准资产阶级司令部，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    经过一年多的斗争，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部正在土崩瓦解。当前，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，已经进入大决战的阶段。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的一小撮代理人，还在进行最后的垂死挣扎，他们还在寻找各种机会向无产阶级革命派进行疯狂的反扑。我们一定不能放松警惕，放松斗争。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更高地举起炮打资产阶级司令部的革命大旗，团结一切可以团结的力量，掀起大批判大斗争的新的革命高潮，集中目标，集中力量，乘胜追击，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭，彻底捣毁资产阶级司令部。在革命的大批判中，实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让富有光荣革命传统的江西，成为毛泽东思想阳光普照的红彤彤的新世界！
