Our factory is a lumber mill with a lot of high-temperature and outdoor work, and the factory buildings are also quite narrow. Every summer, preventing heatstroke and lowering temperatures becomes an urgent issue in production. This year, the leading members of the proletarian revolutionary faction in power have shown the greatest political enthusiasm in caring for their class brothers working in high-temperature operations. They have taken early measures to improve the working conditions in high-temperature operations and have done a good job in preventing heatstroke and lowering temperatures.

The lumber drying workshop is a high-temperature workshop. In the past, the capitalist-roaders within the party acted like officials and lords, not caring about the lives of the people. Technical problems that could have been solved long ago were left unresolved, forcing workers to operate in very hot "fire pits," with poor working conditions and low production efficiency. This year, the production leadership team first addressed the problem of the lumber drying workshop as a test of their mass perspective. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "caring for the people's lives and paying attention to work methods" and, relying on revolutionary workers, found ways to use machinery to replace manual labor, completely solving the problem of lumber entering and exiting the fire pits. This not only improved working conditions and increased work efficiency but also saved a large amount of fuel. The workers excitedly said: The revolutionary leadership team thinks and worries about the same things as we workers do.

In the work of preventing heatstroke and lowering temperatures, some comrades held a purely welfare-oriented view. After the production leadership team discovered this problem, they combined it with the criticism of the capitalist-roaders within the party and the revisionist welfare system they advocated, guiding them to understand that we revolutionaries must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "being thrifty to make revolution" and must not pursue material incentives. The workers in the electrostatic spray painting workshop took the initiative to use discarded materials to make two exhaust fans, solving the cooling problem. Some workers used their days off to install a pipeline for delivering refreshing drinks, ensuring that refreshing drinks were delivered to various production departments in a timely manner.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory cares about the people's production and life, and the people are even more enthusiastic about responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." Since this year, our factory has exceeded production targets every month.

    关怀高温作业工人
    我们厂是高温和露天作业较多的木材厂，厂房也较狭窄。每到夏天，防暑降温，就成为生产中的迫切问题。今年，掌权的无产阶级革命派领导成员，以最大的政治热情关怀高温操作的阶级弟兄，及早改善高温作业的劳动条件，做好了防暑降温工作。
    木材烘干车间是一个高温车间。过去，党内走资本主义道路当权派做官当老爷，不关心群众生活，本来早就可以解决的技术问题，一直拖着没有解决，让工人在温度很高的火洞中操作，劳动条件差，生产效率低。今年，生产领导班子，首先把解决木材烘干车间的问题，作为对自己群众观点的考验。他们认真学习了毛主席“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的教导，并且依靠革命职工共同想办法，利用机械代替人力，彻底解决了木材进出火洞的问题。这就不但改善了劳动条件，提高了工作效率，还节约了大量燃料。工人兴奋地说：革命派领导班子想的，急的，都和咱工人一样。
    在防暑降温工作中，个别同志存有单纯福利观点。生产领导班子发现这个问题以后，就结合对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其所宣扬的一套修正主义福利制度的大批判，引导他们认识到，我们革命派要遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，决不能搞物质刺激那一套。静电喷漆车间工人自己动手，利用废旧材料，做成两部排风扇，解决了降温问题。有的工人同志利用假日装好输送清凉饮料管道，使清凉饮料适时送到各生产部门。
    我们厂无产阶级革命派关心群众生产和生活，群众就更加积极地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。今年以来，我们厂月月超额完成生产任务。
