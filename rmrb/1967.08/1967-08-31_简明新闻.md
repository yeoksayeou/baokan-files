	Indian Deputy Prime Minister Plots Anti-China Activities in Japan

	Under the planning of U.S. imperialism, the Indian reactionary government's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai, amidst the anti-China chorus of the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary forces, visited Japan from August 14 to 22 to intensify his collusion with the Japanese Sato government against China.

	During his visit to Japan, Desai held a series of secret talks with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, Foreign Minister Miki Takeo, and other political and business leaders, focusing on plotting joint anti-China actions. According to Japanese newspapers, these two lackeys of U.S. imperialism, in their secret talks, attacked and slandered China in unison. They used the pretext of China's nuclear test to threaten Japan and India, intensify military collusion, further strengthen the anti-China encirclement, and willingly serve the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' anti-China policies.

	Japanese Reactionaries Cheer for Ne Win's Anti-China Campaign

	Since the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma launched a fierce anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign, it has received enthusiastic support from the Japanese Sato reactionary government.

	According to the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun," the Japanese Foreign Ministry considers that the Ne Win fascist government, under the planning of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is launching a frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign, which is a "politically significant move." It also stated that it would "reconsider Japan's foreign posture" based on this move. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has listed Burma as one of the key countries for Prime Minister Sato's overseas activities in September. The Sato reactionary government has also specially dispatched government officials to Rangoon to secretly collude with the Ne Win reactionary government. It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry is considering emergency measures to provide yen loans to Burma.

	British Government Reorganizes for the Third Time in a Year

	Amidst deepening political and economic crises and intensifying internal disputes within the ruling class, British Prime Minister Wilson reorganized the British government on August 28 for the third time this year.

	According to reports, in the government reorganization, five ministers resigned, and Prime Minister Wilson decided to personally take charge of economic affairs, while promoting his confidant Peter Shore to be the nominal Minister of Economic Affairs.

	British bourgeois newspapers admit that the government reorganization will not save the British ruling class from the various crises it faces. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
