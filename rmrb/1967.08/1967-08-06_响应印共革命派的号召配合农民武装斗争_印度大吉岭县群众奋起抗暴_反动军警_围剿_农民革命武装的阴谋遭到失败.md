	Responding to the Call of the Revolutionary Faction of the CPI, the Masses of Darjeeling County Rise Up to Resist Violence
	The Counter-Revolutionary Military and Police's Plot to "Exterminate" the Armed Peasant Struggle Fails

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- People in Siliguri town, Darjeeling district in northern West Bengal, India, have launched a struggle against the reactionary government's tyranny, in coordination with the armed peasant struggle in the vicinity.

	Several thousand people in Siliguri town demonstrated at the local court on July 29, demanding that a tea garden owner who hoarded grain while the people starved be paraded in handcuffs. However, the reactionary police authorities protected this bloodsucker, rejected the people's demand, and resorted to violent suppression, using batons to beat the demonstrators and firing a large number of tear gas canisters. The people, unable to bear it any longer, rose up to resist, fighting the reactionary police for several hours. The panicked Indian reactionary authorities dispatched state armed forces and border guards to participate in the suppression and ordered a curfew that evening.

	On the morning of July 30, the local people rose up again to resist the violence. They fearlessly set fire to a railway station's parking lot despite the military and police suppression.

	Siliguri town is not far from the red areas of Nasalbari and others in Darjeeling district where peasants are waging armed struggles. The urban and rural people in this area are responding to the call of the revolutionary faction of the CPI, resolutely fighting against the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress and its accomplices, the Dange group, and the revisionist leaders of the CPI.

	In addition, workers from seven tea gardens in Darjeeling district demonstrated on July 25 to support the armed peasant struggle, demanding that the reactionary authorities immediately release the arrested peasants.

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fact that the Indian reactionary government dispatched a large number of military and police to "exterminate" the armed peasant struggle in Darjeeling district for nearly a month, not a single leader of the armed peasant struggle has been arrested.

	According to a report by the Hindustan Times on July 28, the Darjeeling district police are preparing a list of about 300 people who are still wanted, to be distributed to the local peasants. The list includes some of the main leaders whom the Indian reactionary government has been trying to arrest and seduce since the establishment of the peasant armed struggle in Darjeeling.

	The Darjeeling district police chief made a self-congratulatory statement, claiming that the police authorities have "sufficient intelligence" on the activities of the "extremists" since 1965 and are "confident that these extremists will not be able to threaten the security of our country at any stage" and will not "expand this movement to other parts of Bengal." However, this police chief is actually in a state of panic due to the intensified counter-revolutionary "extermination." Since early July, they have established eight police camps in the armed peasant struggle areas and set up eleven patrol posts in the border areas adjacent to Pakistan and Nepal. The reactionary police are not enough, so the reactionary military is sent to reinforce, intensifying patrols and arrests, but to no avail.

	The Indian bourgeois newspaper Indian Light published a commentary on July 30, anxiously stating: "What is happening in Nasalbari is the uprising of the peasants," and it "will pave the way for a thorough revolution in our country." This newspaper, in an article titled "A New Telangana," called for "strong measures to quell the trouble there."

    响应印共革命派的号召配合农民武装斗争
    印度大吉岭县群众奋起抗暴
    反动军警“围剿”农民革命武装的阴谋遭到失败
    新华社四日讯　新德里消息：印度西孟加拉邦北部大吉岭县西里古里镇人民，掀起了反抗反动政府暴政的斗争，同附近开展的农民武装斗争相配合。
    西里古里镇几千群众，七月二十九日到当地法院举行示威，要求把一名不顾人民缺粮挨饿而囤积粮食的茶园园主揪出来戴手铐游街。但是，当地的反动警察当局却保护这个吸血鬼，拒绝群众的要求，并且对群众实行暴力镇压，使用警棍殴打示威者，还发射了大量催泪弹。群众忍无可忍，起来反抗，同反动警察奋战了几个小时。惊慌失措的印度反动当局出动邦武装部队和边防部队去参加镇压，还下令在当天晚间实行戒严。
    七月三十日早上七点，当地群众又起来进行抗暴斗争。他们不怕军警的镇压，放火焚烧了一个火车站的停车场。
    西里古里镇离开大吉岭县农民开展武装斗争的纳萨尔巴里等红色地区不远。这一带的城乡人民，正在响应印共革命派的号召，坚决同印度国大党反动政府和它的帮凶丹吉集团、印共修正主义头目进行斗争。
    此外，大吉岭县七个茶园的工人，在七月二十五日举行示威，支持农民革命武装斗争，要求反动当局立即释放被捕的农民。
    新华社四日讯　新德里消息：尽管印度反动政府派出大批军警在大吉岭县向农民革命武装斗争地区进行了近一个月的“围剿”，农民武装斗争的主要领导人一个也没有被捕。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》七月二十八日报道，大吉岭县警察局正在准备仍然要“通缉”的大约三百人的铅印名单，向当地农民散发。名单上包括了从大吉岭农民革命武装地区建立以来，印度反动政府一直要逮捕和诱降的一些主要领导人。
    大吉岭县警察局长发表谈话，自己安慰自己说，警察当局对“极端分子”从一九六五年以来的活动“掌握了充足的情报”，他“确信这些极端分子无论在什么阶段都不可能对我国的安全形成威胁”，也不会“把这个运动扩展到孟加拉的其它地区”。但是，这个警察局长实际上为加紧进行反革命“围剿”弄得焦头烂额。从七月初以来，他们在农民革命武装斗争地区内设立了八个警察营地；还在这个地区同巴基斯坦和尼泊尔接壤的边境增设了十一个巡逻哨所。反动警察不够用，反动军队去增援，又是加强巡逻，又是加紧搜捕，但是达不到目的。
    印度资产阶级报纸《印度之光》七月三十日发表评论，惊慌地说：“纳萨尔巴里正在发生的事情是农民的奋起”，它“将为在我国举行彻底革命铺平道路”。这家报纸在一篇题为《新的特仑甘纳》的文章中大喊要“用强硬手段把那里的乱子平息下去”。
