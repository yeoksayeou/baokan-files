August 29 is the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the brilliant document by our great leader Chairman Mao, "Statement Opposing the Aggression and Massacre of the Vietnamese People in South Vietnam by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique." It is a year of brilliant victories for the heroic people of South Vietnam, and it is also a year of heavy defeats for the cowardly U.S. imperialists. The victorious development of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation fully proves the series of brilliant judgments made by Chairman Mao in this statement of great historical significance.

When Chairman Mao issued this statement in 1963, the so-called "special warfare" launched by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam had already failed. However, the stubborn U.S. imperialists, in order to realize their evil scheme of permanently occupying South Vietnam, defied the strong opposition of the people of the world and, starting from 1965, brazenly sent large numbers of troops to South Vietnam, launching a large-scale "limited war," and at the same time, sending planes to savage bomb Vietnam Democratic Republic, spreading the war to the entire Vietnamese territory. Thus, U.S. imperialism broke the boundary between North and South Vietnam with one hand.

Facing the maddened expansion of the war by U.S. imperialism, the heroic Vietnamese people are fearless and unshakable, firmly holding the guns in their hands, using the treasure of people's war, and striking back at the enemy. In the past four years, the military and civilians in South Vietnam have annihilated more than 800,000 enemy troops, including more than 200,000 U.S. troops. In the first half of this year, the military and civilians in South Vietnam achieved even greater victories, annihilating more than 200,000 U.S. and puppet troops.

The plan of the U.S.-puppet clique to "eat away" and "pacify" the liberated areas has completely failed. The liberated areas have not only not shrunk but have become more consolidated and expanded. Now, the liberated areas account for four-fifths of the entire territory of South Vietnam, with a population of about 10 million, accounting for three-fourths of the total population of South Vietnam. The vast liberated areas have become the iron-like base area for the South Vietnamese people to persist in the struggle and achieve final victory.

Under the heavy blows of the military and civilians in South Vietnam, the plot of U.S. imperialism to stabilize the puppet regime in South Vietnam has completely failed. In the past four years, the puppets raised by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam have been replaced one after another like a revolving door, and now nine puppets have been replaced. This fully proves what Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will eventually only die for U.S. imperialism." Now, the puppet group of Nguyen Van Thieu in South Vietnam is staging an "election" farce, and the U.S. puppets are fiercely competing to climb onto the "presidential" throne, causing chaos in the enemy-controlled areas.

In North Vietnam, the savage bombing by U.S. bandit planes not only failed to shake the firm will of the Vietnamese people to fight to the end but also failed to stop the sacred support of the people in the North for the people in the South. Instead, they suffered heavy losses. The people of North Vietnam responded to the solemn call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and bravely fought against the U.S. air bandits. So far, the military and civilians in North Vietnam have shot down more than 2,200 U.S. bandit planes and captured a large number of U.S. air pirates.

At present, the entire Vietnamese battlefield is in a great situation. The Vietnamese people, by persisting in people's war, have already beaten U.S. imperialism into a state of panic and desperation, exposing its true colors as a paper tiger to the people of the world. The Vietnamese people are full of fighting spirit and confidence, advancing from victory to victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." The past four years have proved that the Vietnamese people have seen through the various tricks and deceits of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, do not believe in the enemy's "wisdom," and persist in unity and struggle, thus achieving the great situation on the Vietnamese battlefield.

In the past four years, the struggle over the Vietnamese issue in the international arena has been tortuous and complex. U.S. imperialism is both ferocious and cunning, and it has always used the two strategies of war and "peace" in the Vietnamese issue. On the one hand, it continuously expands the Vietnamese war, madly engages in military adventures, and tries to "suppress by war" or "force by deceit"; on the other hand, it continuously releases the "peace talk" smoke screen, attempting to use "peace talk" to cover up its war escalation and induce the Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and surrender to it. In short, regardless of whether U.S. imperialism uses the means of war or the means of "peace talk" deception, its ultimate goal is to permanently occupy South Vietnam and then invade North Vietnam.

U.S. imperialism's two-faced strategy against Vietnam has received the active cooperation of its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership. In order to help U.S. imperialism realize its evil scheme of invading Vietnam and extinguish the flames of struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionist leadership openly betrays the Vietnamese people and spares no effort to peddle the U.S. "peace talk" deception. The Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin even personally rushed to the United States and Britain to have secret talks with the butcher of the Vietnamese people, Johnson, and the faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism, Wilson, to plot the evil deal of selling out the Vietnamese people. Recently, under the instigation and encouragement of the Soviet revisionists, U.S. imperialism has accelerated the pace of war "escalation." It not only announced that it would continue to send 45,000 more troops to South Vietnam but also continuously bombed the capital of the Vietnam Democratic Republic, Hanoi, and the city of Lang Son near China. At the same time, the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy is also plotting a new "peace talk" deception. This is something that people should pay close attention to.

In the past four years, the Vietnamese people have been tested in this arduous and complex struggle. They are indeed heroic people. They have neither been frightened by the ferocity of U.S. imperialism nor deceived by the "peace talk" tricks of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. They have realized from their own experience that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement, U.S. imperialism will not put down its butcher's knife, nor will it become a Buddha overnight. Therefore, their response to the enemy is: resolutely fight, fight hard, and fight continuously. As long as there are U.S. aggressors in Vietnam, they will fight to the end until the sacred Vietnamese territory is completely liberated. The Vietnamese people's spirit of thorough revolution that shakes the mountains and rivers is the fundamental guarantee of their victory and has set a brilliant example for the people of the world. At the same time, the just struggle of the Vietnamese people has also won the firm support of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Four years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao expressed in the statement his firm belief that the people of South Vietnam would definitely achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Now, we see more clearly that Chairman Mao's great prophecy is being realized day by day through the struggle of the people of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people strengthen their unity and persist in struggle, and they will definitely thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve national reunification. The Vietnamese people will win, and U.S. imperialism will be defeated.

A heroic unit of South Vietnam that has achieved many victories swears at a mobilization meeting before the battle, determined to wipe out the U.S. aggressor invaders!

    紧握手中枪杆子  运用人民战争法宝
    南越人民打出一片大好形势
    据新华社二十八日讯　本社记者述评：八月二十九日是我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表的光辉文献《反对美国—吴庭艳集团侵略和屠杀越南南方人民的声明》四周年。这是英雄的越南南方人民取得辉煌胜利的四年，也是色厉内荏的美帝国主义遭到惨重失败的四年。越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利发展，完全证实了毛主席在这项具有伟大历史意义的声明中所作的一系列英明论断。
    毛主席在一九六三年发表这项声明的时候，美帝国主义在越南南方发动的所谓“特种战争”已经遭到失败。但是，顽固透顶的美帝国主义，为了实现其永远霸占越南南方的罪恶阴谋，不顾全世界人民的强烈反对，从一九六五年开始，悍然向越南南方大举增兵，发动了大规模的“局部战争”，同时，出动飞机野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国，把战火引向越南全境。这样，美帝国主义就一手打破了越南南北界限。
    面对着美帝国主义疯狂扩大战争的行动，英雄的越南人民毫不畏惧、毫不动摇，紧握手中的枪杆子，运用人民战争的法宝，迎头痛击敌人。四年来，南越军民共歼灭敌军八十多万，其中美军有二十多万。今年上半年，南越军民取得了更大的胜利，歼灭美伪军二十多万。
    美伪集团妄图“蚕食”和“绥靖”解放区的计划，也完全破产。解放区不仅没有缩小，相反日益巩固和扩大，现在解放区已占整个南越土地的五分之四，人口约一千万，占南越总人口的四分之三。广大的解放区已经成为南越人民坚持抗战、夺取最后胜利的钢铁般的根据地。
    在南越军民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义力图稳定南越伪政权的阴谋根本无法得逞。四年来，美帝国主义在南越扶植的走狗，象走马灯似的接连换个不停，到现在已经更换了九条走狗。这完全证实了毛主席在声明中所指出的“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”现在，南越阮高其傀儡集团正在上演
  “选举”丑剧，美国的走狗们为争夺登上“总统”宝座而展开了激烈的争斗，敌人统治区一片混乱。
    在越南北方，美国强盗飞机的野蛮轰炸，不仅不能丝毫动摇越南人民抗战到底的坚强意志，无法阻止北方人民对南方人民的神圣支援，而且遭到了惨重的损失。越南北方人民响应胡志明主席的庄严号召，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，英勇打击美国空中强盗。到目前为止，越南北方军民已经击落美国强盗飞机二千二百多架，活捉了大批美国飞贼。
    目前，整个越南战场是一片大好形势。越南人民由于坚持人民战争，已经把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，走投无路，使它的纸老虎的原形赤裸裸地暴露在世界人民面前。越南人民斗志昂扬，信心百倍，正从胜利走向新的胜利。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在声明中指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”四年来的事实证明，越南人民正是看穿了美帝国主义及其走狗的各种阴谋诡计，不相信敌人的“明智”，而坚持团结斗争，才打出了越南战场的大好局面。
    四年来，在国际范围内，围绕着越南问题而展开的斗争是曲折复杂的。美帝国主义既凶恶残暴，又诡诈狡猾，在越南问题上它一直反复交替地使用战、“和”反革命两手策略。一方面，它不断扩大越南战争，疯狂地进行军事冒险，“以战压降”或“以诈迫和”；另一方面，它又不断施放“和谈”烟幕，妄图用“和谈”掩盖其战争升级，并诱使越南人民放下手中武器，向它屈膝投降。一句话，美帝国主义不管用战争的手段也好，或用“和谈”欺骗的手段也好，它的最终目的就是要永远霸占越南南方，并进而侵占越南北方。
    美帝国主义对越南的这种反革命两手策略，得到了它的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团的积极配合。为了帮助美帝国主义实现其侵略越南的罪恶阴谋，扑灭越南人民的斗争烈火，苏联修正主义领导集团公开叛卖越南人民，不遗余力地推销美帝的“和谈”骗局。苏修头目柯西金甚至亲自跑到美国和英国，同屠杀越南人民的刽子手约翰逊和美帝的忠实走卒威尔逊进行密谈，策划出卖越南人民的罪恶勾当。最近在苏修的怂恿和鼓励下，美帝国主义又加快了战争“升级”的步伐，它不仅宣布要继续向南越增兵四万五千人，而且连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市和邻近中国的谅山。与此同时，美苏合谋又在策划新的“和谈”骗局。这是值得人们密切注意的。
    四年来，越南人民在这艰苦复杂的斗争中经受了考验。他们不愧为英雄的人民。他们既没有被美帝国主义的凶焰所吓倒，也不受美苏
  “和谈”阴谋的欺骗。他们从切身的经验中认识到，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。正象毛主席在声明中所指出的，美帝国主义不会放下屠刀，也不会立地成佛。因此，他们对敌人的回答就是：坚决打、狠狠打、连续打，只要越南还有美国侵略者，就要打到底，直到神圣的越南国土获得完全解放。越南人民的这种气壮山河的彻底革命精神，是他们取得胜利的根本保证，并且为全世界人民树立了光辉的榜样。同时，越南人民的正义斗争，也得到了中国人民和全世界人民的坚决支持。
    四年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在声明中表示深信，越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献。现在，我们更加清楚地看到，毛主席的伟大的预言，通过越南南方人民的斗争，正在一天天得到实现。越南人民加强团结、坚持斗争，就一定会彻底打败美国侵略者，实现国家的统一。越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。（附图片）
