Vice Premier Li Xiannian, at a banquet held in honor of the joint economic delegation from Tanzania and Zambia, reaffirmed that the Chinese people will continue to stand firmly with the peoples of African countries, resolutely supporting their just struggle against old and new colonialism and for the defense of national independence.

In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, marks a new and deeper stage in China's socialist revolution. This revolution not only shatters the imperialists' and modern revisionists' dreams of restoring capitalism in China but will also enable the 700 million Chinese people to better fulfill their internationalist duty of supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and the construction efforts of friendly countries. Vice Premier Li Xiannian reaffirmed China's eight principles for foreign economic aid. He said that our aid is to support the self-reliance of friendly countries in Asia and Africa, to develop their national economies, to consolidate their independence, and to strengthen the unity of the peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in his speech, extended a warm welcome to Finance Minister Jamal of Tanzania and Minister of State Sokko of Zambia, who led the joint economic delegation of the two countries. He expressed his firm belief that the combat friendship established between the Chinese people and the peoples of Tanzania, Zambia, and other African countries in their common struggle against imperialism and colonialism is unbreakable by any force.

Minister Jamal, speaking on behalf of himself and Minister Sokko, said at the banquet that the joint economic delegation from Tanzania and Zambia brought with them the fraternal friendship of the Tanzanian and Zambian peoples to the Chinese people.

He said, "We know that a society should continuously develop and revolutionize. We sincerely praise China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

He said, "The peoples of Tanzania and Zambia, these two friendly countries, have the duty to devote themselves to the cause of consolidating national independence and strengthening African unity. China's aid to the economic construction of Tanzania and Zambia helps us achieve these two goals and will further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China, Tanzania, and Zambia."

Leaders from various sectors of China, Tanzanian Ambassador Mwaluko to China, and envoys from African countries to China attended the banquet.
