Our great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," which has epoch-making significance, has opened up the path for the great victory of the Cultural Revolution and pointed out the main direction of struggle for the revolutionary masses. We resolutely respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, concentrating our firepower and target, further launching a revolutionary big criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. This is the fundamental measure to prevent capitalist restoration.

The bourgeois headquarters, headed by China's Khrushchev, has for many years opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have used the Party and government powers they have usurped to form cliques, recruit traitors, and gather those within the Party, government, and military who are taking the capitalist road, attempting to achieve capitalist restoration in socialist China. In every political movement, they have resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, attempting to suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement initiated by Chairman Mao. At this critical juncture, Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" has most brilliantly and profoundly exposed the reactionary face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, making these revisionist counter-revolutionaries reveal their true colors in broad daylight, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Over the past year, the August 18 Revolutionary Rebel Corps and revolutionary organizations in the Inner Mongolia region, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, have engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the bourgeois headquarters and those in the Inner Mongolia region who are taking the capitalist road, repelling the repeated counterattacks of those taking the capitalist road, exposing the handful of bad elements who have infiltrated the Party, government, and military, and achieving great victories.

Now, the bourgeois headquarters has been scattered, and China's Khrushchev has been pulled down from his horse. But they are not reconciled to their defeat, and their influence has not been completely eliminated. The poison of revisionism they have spread is still rotting and stinking among us like a corpse. If we do not, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, smash the fallen dog, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters politically, ideologically, and theoretically, they may counterattack and engage in activities to restore capitalism again.

We revolutionary masses must closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, closely follow the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, deeply launch a revolutionary big criticism, and fight this decisive battle to the end. We must, in the revolutionary big criticism, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making our thoughts and actions conform to the correct track of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting with the broad revolutionary masses, achieving the broadest possible unity with the revolutionary leftists as the core, forming a mighty revolutionary army, and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. Only in this way can we ensure that our socialist state will never change color.

    坚决打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫
    呼和浩特市八·一八革命造反团
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的《炮打司令部》这张具有划时代意义的大字报，为无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进开辟了航道，为无产阶级革命派指出了斗争的主攻方向。我们坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，以毛泽东思想为武器，集中火力，集中目标，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，进一步展开革命的大批判，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。这是防止资本主义复辟的根本措施。
    以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，多年来反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线。他们利用窃取的党政大权，结党营私，招降纳叛，网罗党政军内走资本主义道路当权派，妄想在社会主义的中国实现资本主义复辟。他们在历次政治运动中，对抗毛主席的革命路线；在无产阶级文化大革命中，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，企图将毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。就在这紧要关头，毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，最英明、最深刻地揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动嘴脸，使这些反革命修正主义分子的原形暴露在光天化日之下，大长无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭资产阶级老爷们的威风。
    一年来，我们八·一八革命造反团和内蒙古地区的各革命组织，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，同资产阶级司令部、同内蒙古地区的走资本主义道路当权派，进行了你死我活的大搏斗，击退了走资本主义道路当权派的多次反扑，揪出了混进党里、政府里、军队里的一小撮坏家伙，取得了伟大的胜利。
    现在，资产阶级司令部被打得七零八落，中国的赫鲁晓夫被拉下马了。但他们并不甘心自己的失败，他们的影响还没有完全清除，他们散布的修正主义流毒，还象死尸一样在我们当中腐烂发臭。如果我们不以狠打落水狗的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，他们就可能反扑过来，重搞资本主义复辟的活动。
    我们无产阶级革命派一定要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，发扬彻底革命的精神，高举革命的批判旗帜，深入开展革命的大批判，把这场大决战进行到底。我们要在革命的大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，使自己的思想和行动纳入毛泽东思想的正确轨道，团结广大革命群众，实现以革命左派为核心的最广泛的大联合，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁。这样，才能保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
