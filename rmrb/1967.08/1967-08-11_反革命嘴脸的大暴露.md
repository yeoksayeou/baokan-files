The counter-revolutionary face of China's Khrushchev has been fully exposed. For a long time, he has resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary diplomatic line. The reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia" is a major exposure of his counter-revolutionary face.

Throughout his visit to Indonesia, China's Khrushchev never mentioned Chairman Mao and did not speak a word about Mao Zedong Thought. He saw his own giant portraits, along with those of his wife and the bourgeois element Wang XX, hanging everywhere, and he was extremely pleased. To raise his profile and gain political capital, he ordered the news agencies to widely broadcast news and photos of his visit, and he even found the radio news broadcast too simple, immediately ordering relevant personnel to "improve" it. He also found the reports about his wife's speeches insufficient and repeatedly ordered additional coverage. What is intolerable is that he not only did not actively promote Mao Zedong Thought, but when the Indonesian people eagerly wanted to hear the envoy from Mao Zedong's hometown speak, he simply ignored them. Once, more than ten thousand people in Bandung gathered in the square under pouring rain waiting for him to speak, but his "exalted presence" did not appear. Even worse, in the speech prepared for him, any mention of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought was all cut out.

In contemporary times, supporting or opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone for distinguishing between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The top capitalist-roader in the Party shamelessly opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in Indonesia, fully exposing himself as a "Khrushchev-style" individual with personal ambitions.

During his visit to Indonesia, China's Khrushchev vigorously promoted a revisionist diplomatic line.

In 1963, the Indonesian people fought against the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia," created by American and British imperialism. Under these circumstances, the Chinese leader visiting Indonesia should have strongly supported the Indonesian people's anti-American struggle, further strengthened the revolutionary unity and combat friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, and expanded and consolidated the anti-American united front. However, during his nine-day visit to Indonesia, China's Khrushchev never dared to raise the issue of the anti-American struggle. The American imperialists found this strange, and the host country Indonesia also found it incomprehensible. At that time, an Indonesian newspaper editorial stated: "What attracted Indonesia's attention was that this guest did not mention the leaders of China, who often talk about the United States, in his speech."

Actually, this is not surprising. Chairman Mao taught us: "Look at its past to know its present; look at its past and present to know its future." Soon after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the American imperialists were vigorously arming and supporting the Kuomintang bandits to launch a large-scale attack on our liberated areas, it was this top capitalist-roader in the Party who was terrified of the American imperialists and hurriedly appealed to the U.S. government for "peace," asking the American imperialists to "sympathize with China's peaceful cause." More than twenty years ago, he had already surrendered to the American imperialists, and today he is merely walking further down the path of capitulation!

In 1963, to suppress the national democratic revolutionary movement and extinguish the progressive forces in Indonesia, and to complete the encirclement of China, the American imperialists merged the last few colonial territories of the British Empire in Southeast Asia into "Malaysia." This sinister plan of aggression met with strong opposition from the people of the region. An armed uprising broke out in North Kalimantan, and Indonesia saw a widespread mass movement against imperialism and "Malaysia." The Chinese people and the Chinese government gave timely and effective support to the Indonesian people's just struggle. However, after China's Khrushchev arrived in Indonesia, he ignored the clear stance of our government and our people in firmly supporting the Indonesian people's opposition to "Malaysia." He blathered on about how "we don't fully understand the situation," pouring cold water on the anti-imperialist struggle of the people in this region, and taking a passive attitude towards the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations. He had completely degenerated into a shameful Social Democrat.

China's Khrushchev actively advocated class capitulationism and openly betrayed the proletarian revolution. In 1946, he promoted the so-called "new stage of peaceful democracy" within the Party, demanding that our Party surrender its military power to engage in parliamentary struggle and "become officials of the central government." After the founding of New China, he remained unrepentant and used various opportunities to spread various fallacies to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He blathered on about how "not all countries and places can engage in armed struggle," openly opposing Chairman Mao's great thought of seizing power through armed struggle.

In 1963, China's Khrushchev used his visit to Indonesia to once again blow the trumpet of the "new stage of peaceful democracy," vigorously peddling the revisionist black goods of "peaceful transition" to poison the Indonesian people. China's Khrushchev acted as a spokesman for the bourgeoisie to deceive the people, actively praising the "Nasakom" policy of class reconciliation, saying that "the national unity of Indonesia, with Nasakom as its core, is becoming stronger day by day." He encouraged the representatives of proletarian parties to participate in the bourgeois dictatorship government, saying that "this can accumulate experience in governing the country." Exposed, this is to make the Indonesian proletariat abandon armed struggle, abandon the principle of independence and autonomy in the united front, implement the line of class capitulationism, and "peacefully transition into socialism" together with the bourgeoisie. This is a thorough and complete Khrushchev-style fallacy of "peaceful transition."

Chairman Mao said: "Some capitalist countries also allow the Communist Party to exist legally, but only to the extent that it does not harm the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie. Beyond this limit, it is not allowed." Historical facts tell us that the reactionary classes will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. When they feel that their ruling position is threatened, they will always suppress the revolutionary mass movement. The bloody massacre of communists and revolutionary people by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique after the "September 30th Movement" in Indonesia is a resounding slap in the face of China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the top capitalist-roader in the Party has been exposed. His "three surrenders and one destruction" counter-revolutionary revisionist diplomatic line has also been thoroughly exposed and bankrupted. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, and a great victory for the international communist movement.

    反革命嘴脸的大暴露
    寰球赤
    中国的赫鲁晓夫长期以来抵制和反对毛主席的革命外交路线。反动纪录影片《访问印度尼西亚》就是他反革命嘴脸的一次大暴露。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在访问印尼的过程中，自始至终不提毛主席，绝口不谈毛泽东思想。他看见到处悬挂他与他老婆、资产阶级分子王××的巨幅画像，洋洋得意。为了抬高身价，大捞政治资本，他责令新闻机关大量播发他访问的消息和图片，还嫌口语广播新闻稿“太简单”，立即要有关人员去“改进”。他对报道他老婆的讲话也嫌太少，再三下令补报。令人不能容忍的是，他不但不主动宣传毛泽东思想，而当印尼人民迫切希望听到来自毛泽东故乡的使者亲自讲话时，他竟然不予理睬。有一次，万隆一万多群众冒着滂沱大雨聚集在广场等候他讲话，但是，他的“大驾”竟不光临。尤其恶劣的是，为他准备的讲话稿中凡提毛主席和毛泽东思想的地方，都一一加以斧削。
    在当代，拥护还是反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，是区别革命或反革命、马列主义或修正主义的试金石。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在印尼肆无忌惮地反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，只能暴露出他完全是一个“赫鲁晓夫式”的个人野心家。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在访问印尼的过程中竭力推行修正主义的外交路线。
    一九六三年，印尼人民对美英帝国主义制造的新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”展开了斗争。在这种情况下，出访印尼的中国领导人，理应大力支持印尼人民的反美斗争，进一步加强中国人民同印尼人民的革命团结和战斗友谊，扩大和巩固反美统一战线。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫在访问印尼的九天里，始终不敢提反美斗争的问题。对此，美帝国主义感到奇怪，东道国印尼也感到不理解。当时印尼的报纸发表社论说：“引起印尼注意的是”，这位客人“在他的讲话中完全没有提到中国的领袖们常常谈到的美国。”
    其实，这并不奇怪。毛主席教导我们说：“看它的过去，就可以知道它的现在；看它的过去和现在，就可以知道它的将来。”早在抗日战争结束不久，当美帝大力武装和支持蒋匪帮向我解放区大肆进攻时，就是这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对美帝怕得要死，急急忙忙地向美国政府“呼吁和平”，要美帝“同情中国的和平事业”。他在二十多年前就向美帝屈膝投降，今天他只不过是在投降主义的道路上走得更远罢了！
    一九六三年，美帝国主义为了镇压民族民主革命运动，扑灭印尼的进步力量，完成对中国的包围，把英帝在东南亚最后几块殖民地合并为“马来西亚”。这个罪恶的侵略计划，遭到这个地区人民的强烈反对，北加里曼丹爆发了人民的武装起义，印尼也出现了反帝抗马的广泛群众运动。中国人民和中国政府对印尼人民进行的这场正义斗争，给予了及时有效的声援和支持。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫到印尼后，不顾我国政府和我国人民坚决支持印尼人民对抗“马来西亚”的鲜明立场，他胡说什么“我们不大了解情况”，向这个地区人民的反帝斗争大泼冷水，对被压迫民族的解放斗争采取消极的态度，他完全堕落成了可耻的社会民主党人。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫积极鼓吹阶级投降主义，公然背叛无产阶级革命。一九四六年，他在党内推行过所谓“和平民主新阶段”的黑货，要我们党交出兵权，去搞议会斗争，“去作中央政府的官”。新中国成立后，他贼心不死，利用各种机会，向亚非拉各国人民大肆散布各种谬论。他胡说什么“不是一切国家、一切地方都可以进行武装斗争”，公然反对毛主席关于武装夺取政权的伟大思想。
    一九六三年，中国的赫鲁晓夫利用访问印尼的机会，又重新吹起“和平民主新阶段”的破喇叭，大肆兜售“和平过渡”的修正主义黑货，来毒害印尼人民。中国的赫鲁晓夫充当资产阶级欺骗人民的说客，积极吹捧“阶级调和”的“纳沙贡”政策，说什么“以纳沙贡为核心的印尼的民族团结正在日益加强。”他鼓励无产阶级政党的代表参加资产阶级专政的政府，说什么“这可以积累管理国家的经验。”拆穿了，这就是要印尼无产阶级放弃武装斗争，放弃在统一战线中独立自主的原则，实行阶级投降主义路线，同资产阶级一起“和平长入社会主义”。这是彻头彻尾的赫鲁晓夫式的“和平过渡”的谬论。
    毛主席说：“有些资本主义国家也容许共产党合法存在，但是以不危害资产阶级的根本利益为限度，超过这个限度就不容许了。”历史事实告诉我们，反动阶级从来不会自动退出历史舞台，当他们感到自己的统治地位受到威胁时，他们总是要镇压革命群众运动的。印尼“九·卅运动”事件后，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团血腥屠杀共产党人和革命人民的惨痛事实，就是给中国的赫鲁晓夫的修正主义谬论一记响亮的耳光。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派被揪出来了。他的“三降一灭”的反革命修正主义外交路线也随着彻底暴露和破产了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，也是国际共产主义运动的伟大胜利。
