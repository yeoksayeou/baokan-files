The China-Vietnam Friendship Association held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Comrades Nguyen Van Huan and Ho Quy, who came to participate in the activities celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council, and responsible persons from various relevant departments, Zhang Siyu, Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, as well as representatives of the revolutionary masses of Beijing, attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with the spirit of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

Ding Xilin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and a member of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, spoke first at the banquet. He enthusiastically praised the great victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism for national liberation. He said that under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, the heroic Vietnamese people have achieved brilliant victories in their struggle against U.S. imperialism for national liberation. The victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism for national liberation are a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people and to revolutionary people all over the world. The Chinese people are overjoyed by every victory achieved by the Vietnamese people.

Ding Xilin strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war in Vietnam and strongly condemned the criminal collusion between the Soviet modern revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism in betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. He said that the heroic Vietnamese people are not to be intimidated or deceived. We are firmly convinced that the Vietnamese people, who dare to struggle and persist in struggle, will surely be able to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and realize their desire to liberate the South and unify the country. Ding Xilin once again expressed that the Chinese people will definitely be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, firmly support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call to Arms," and firmly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism until they achieve final victory.

When talking about the Cultural Revolution in our country, Ding Xilin said that at present, our people are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out a broad and deep revolutionary criticism and struggle, determined to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. This struggle has already achieved great victories.

Nguyen Van Huan, the head of the delegation, enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. He said that today, the peoples of Vietnam and China are more closely united in the struggle to build socialism and oppose imperialism led by the United States. The fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China has been further consolidated and developed.

Nguyen Van Huan thanked the Chinese people for their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism for national liberation. He said that under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people have an unshakable will to struggle, an invincible people's war, and a powerful rear guard—the sincere support of 700 million Chinese people. We will surely be able to defeat the U.S. aggressors, surely be able to realize the pledge to defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately unify the country.

Nguyen Van Huan said that the Vietnamese people are happy about the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism for national liberation. He wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

Vietnamese Ambassador to China Vu Minh Quan and Deputy Head of the Vietnam National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China Le Thong San were also invited to attend the banquet.
