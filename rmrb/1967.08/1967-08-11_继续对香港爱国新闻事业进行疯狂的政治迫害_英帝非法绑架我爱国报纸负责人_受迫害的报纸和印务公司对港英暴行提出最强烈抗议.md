The British Empire Illegally Kidnaps Leaders of Our Patriotic Newspapers
Newspapers and Printing Companies Under Persecution Strongly Protest Against the Brutality of the British in Hong Kong

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 10th - The wicked British fascist authorities in Hong Kong illegally kidnapped the leaders of three patriotic newspapers and one printing company early on the 9th, continuing their mad political persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry.

At around 4 a.m. on the 9th, the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong dispatched fully armed police officers, carrying long and short guns and iron bars, to raid the residences of the editor-in-chief of the *Hong Kong Evening News*, Hu Di Zhou; the editor-in-chief of the *Tian Feng Daily*, Pan Huai Wei, and the supervisor of printing, Chen Yan Juan; the editor-in-chief of the *Xin Wu Daily*, Mai Wei Ming; and the chairman of Nanchang Printing Company, Li Shao Xiong, the supervisor of printing of the *Hong Kong Commercial Daily*, and the manager of Nanchang Printing Company, Zhai Nuan Hui. They conducted illegal searches and kidnapped Hu Di Zhou, Pan Huai Wei, Chen Yan Juan, Li Shao Xiong, and Zhai Nuan Hui. According to the Hong Kong "News Department" announcement on the morning of the 9th, the British authorities will also fabricate various "charges" to conduct illegal "interrogations" of Hu Di Zhou and the other four.

The British fascist authorities' illegal kidnapping of the leaders of patriotic newspapers is another serious incident in their mad political persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry. Since May, Hong Kong police and plainclothes agents have repeatedly brutally beaten and detained reporters from Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, China News Agency, and the *Wen Hui Daily*, *Ta Kung Daily*, and *Xin Wan Daily*, as well as staff of patriotic newspapers. They have kidnapped fourteen reporters from Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and the *Wen Hui Daily*, *Ta Kung Daily*, *Xin Wan Daily*, *Hong Kong Commercial Daily*, *Jing Bao*, and *Economic Guide* on four occasions, conducting illegal "interrogations" and "sentencing" against them. Recently, the British authorities have also used their "Police Department" and "Trade Department" officials to send so-called "lawyer's letters" to *Jing Bao* and *Ta Kung Daily*, threatening to file "legal complaints" against these two patriotic newspapers, openly practicing political intimidation. On August 4th and 7th, armed Hong Kong police also conducted illegal searches and looting of the patriotic magazines *Youth Knowledge* and *Youth Paradise*. In addition, the British fascist authorities have continuously maligned and blocked news from Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and patriotic newspapers, even engaging in armed provocations. Now, they have gone further by kidnapping the leaders of patriotic newspapers at night, showing their extreme hatred and fear of the patriotic newspapers and news workers in Hong Kong who insist on propagating the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on the struggle against British oppression and exposing the British authorities' heinous crimes against Chinese compatriots.

However, the British fascist authorities' mad persecution cannot intimidate the patriotic newspapers and news workers who insist on the struggle. The *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tian Feng Daily*, and *Xin Wu Daily* continued normal publication on the 9th, and they published a joint statement from the "Committee Against British Persecution" on the first page, strongly protesting against the British fascist authorities. The joint statement said: "Your fascist methods cannot intimidate us. Our struggle is just. As long as there is one person left, our newspapers will continue to operate, continuing to propagate the struggle against oppression until you surrender or perish." The joint statement warned the British authorities: "You must immediately restore the freedom of the kidnapped individuals and not harm them in any way, otherwise, you will face double punishment."

The *Hong Kong Commercial Daily* and Nanchang Printing Company also issued protest statements, demanding that the British authorities immediately release the kidnapped individuals and solemnly declaring: "We firmly stand on the patriotic side and will unite with our compatriots in the struggle against British oppression and fight together."

The persecuted newspapers, including the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tian Feng Daily*, and *Xin Wu Daily*, published commentaries today, protesting against the British fascist atrocities. The commentary in the *Hong Kong Evening News* said: The British fascist authorities are on the brink of death. We are determined to continue the struggle against you. We will redouble our efforts to propagate the socialist motherland, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and report on the inspiring news of the struggle against oppression.

    继续对香港爱国新闻事业进行疯狂的政治迫害
    英帝非法绑架我爱国报纸负责人
    受迫害的报纸和印务公司对港英暴行提出最强烈抗议
    据新华社香港十日电 万恶的港英法西斯当局九日凌晨非法绑架了香港三家爱国报纸和一家印务公司的负责人，继续对香港爱国新闻事业进行疯狂的政治迫害。
    九日凌晨四时许，港英法西斯当局派出全副武装的警察，携带长、短枪和铁棒之类的器械，闯进《香港夜报》社长胡棣周，《田丰日报》社长潘怀伟、督印人陈艳娟，《新午报》社长麦炜明，和承印这三家报纸的南昌印务公司董事长、《香港商报》督印人李少雄，南昌印务公司经理翟暖晖等人的住宅，进行非法搜查，并把胡棣周、潘怀伟、陈艳娟、李少雄、翟暖晖五人绑架而去。据港英“新闻处”九日晨宣布，港英当局还将罗织各种“罪名”，对胡棣周等五人进行非法“审讯”。
    港英法西斯当局这次非法绑架爱国报纸的负责人，是它对香港爱国新闻事业进行疯狂的政治迫害的又一个严重事件。从今年五月以来，港英警察和便衣特务，曾经多次横蛮殴打和留难新华社香港分社记者、中国通讯社记者和《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》的记者，以及爱国报纸的工作人员。曾经四次绑架新华社香港分社记者和《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》、《香港商报》、《晶报》和《经济导报》的记者共十四人，并对他们进行非法“审讯”和“判刑”。最近，港英当局又通过它的“警务处”和“工商处”官员，对《晶报》和《大公报》发出所谓“律师信”，威胁要对这两家爱国报纸进行所谓“法律控告”，公然实行政治恐吓。八月四日和七日，港英武装警察还分别对爱国杂志《青年知识》和《青年乐园》进行非法搜查和劫掠。此外，港英法西斯当局还连续对新华社香港分社和爱国报纸进行恶毒的咒骂和封锁消息，甚至进行武装挑衅。现在，它更变本加厉地黑夜绑架爱国报纸的负责人，这表明它对香港爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者坚持宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，坚持反英抗暴斗争和揭露港英迫害中国同胞的滔天罪行，恨得要命，怕得要死。
    但是，港英法西斯当局的疯狂迫害，是吓不倒坚持斗争的爱国报纸和爱国新闻工作者的。《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》九日继续正常出版，它们在第一版上刊登了三报“反对港英迫害斗争委员会”的联合声明，对港英法西斯当局提出最强烈的抗议。联合声明说：“你们的法西斯手段是吓不倒人的，我们的斗争是正义的，只要还有一个人，我们的报纸就要办下去，继续宣传抗暴斗争，直到你们低头或灭亡为止。”联合声明警告港英当局：必须立即恢复被绑架者的人身自由，不准动他们一根毫毛，否则将受到加倍惩罚。
    《香港商报》和南昌印务公司也都发表抗议声明，严正要求港英当局立即放人，并庄严宣布：我们坚决站在爱国立场，在反英抗暴斗争中和爱国同胞团结在一起，战斗在一起。
    受迫害的报纸《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》、《新午报》等今天发表评论，抗议港英的法西斯暴行。《香港夜报》的评论说：港英法西斯当局已在垂死的边缘，我们下定决心要和你们斗争下去。我们要以更大的努力，去宣传社会主义祖国，宣传毛泽东思想，和报道抗暴斗争振奋人心的消息。
