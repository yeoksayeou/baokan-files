	Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao!
	—Warmly Celebrating the Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group
	*Changjiang Daily* Editorial on July 31

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 1

	Emerging from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, the *Changjiang Daily* published an editorial on July 31 titled "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao! —Warmly Celebrating the Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group." The full text is as follows:

	Chairman Mao has written a letter.

	The Yangtze River is smiling, the three cities are in tumult, red flags are rolling, and drums are resonating. The military and people of Wuhan unanimously cheer: "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao!"

	The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan was delivered directly to the 2.2 million people of Wuhan and the 3.3 million people of Hubei yesterday.

	Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letter brought the most intimate care and the greatest encouragement to the proletarian revolutionary factions and the revolutionary masses of workers and peasants, as well as the broad ranks of soldiers in Wuhan and Hubei.

	Wuhan is once again immersed in the joyous tumult of a grand battle festival.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you, it is you with the Party Central Committee at your helm, who have given the highest evaluation and the greatest support to the heroic struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad ranks of soldiers in the Wuhan region to defend the proletarian cultural revolution personally led and initiated by you, to defend your brilliant thoughts, and to defend your proletarian revolutionary line.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you, it is you with the Party Central Committee at your helm, who have once again pointed out the direction for the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan and throughout the country.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who personally initiated and led this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. You personally decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Peking University, igniting the blazing flames of the proletarian cultural revolution across the country. Under your wise leadership, the Red Guard movement shook the world, creating immortal merits for the proletarian cultural revolution; the storm of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai swept the nation, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution to a new stage of great unity among the proletarian revolutionary factions and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; the three articles published in the *Red Flag* magazine, such as "Patriotism or Treachery?", sounded the charge for the final assault on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the decisive stage of the proletarian cultural revolution has arrived.

	The enemy will not perish of its own accord. They will not accept their own destruction and will inevitably make their final desperate struggles. The Chinese Khrushchov's agents in the Wuhan region—the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road—have launched a savage counterattack and suppression against the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region, eventually developing into open opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is a concentrated reflection of this desperate struggle.

	The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Wuhan region—the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road—and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have completely misjudged the situation and have lifted a stone only to drop it on their own feet. The revolutionary people and new revolutionary forces armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible forever.

	Under the intimate care and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Party Central Committee, the brave proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad ranks of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have fought bravely and struggled tenaciously, quickly smashing the enemy's plots.

	This is another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line after the proletarian cultural revolution in our country entered the stage of life-and-death struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines!

	This great victory declares the thorough bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line, deeply educates the broad revolutionary masses, and pushes the proletarian cultural revolution in the Wuhan region to a new stage of victory. It inspires the people of the entire country, and a new high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution throughout the country has begun!

	In the midst of the victory song, we, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region, must not forget: the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are still attempting to make desperate struggles and counterattacks. Therefore, we must have a clear mind and maintain a thousandfold high level of revolutionary vigilance.

	"We should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the Wuhan region will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's expectations, will definitely respond to the Party Central Committee's great call, and will definitely act according to the five instructions proposed in the letter. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and in the common struggle, we will unite closely, wage a great "people's war," and root out all the handful of power-holders within the Party and the proletarian dictatorship apparatus who are taking the capitalist road, expose them thoroughly, and fight them to the end, vowing to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
    ——热烈欢呼中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组的来信
    《长江日报》七月三十一日社论
    新华社武汉一日电　从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中冲杀出来的《长江日报》，七月三十一日发表题为《毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
    ——热烈欢呼中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组的来信》的社论，全文如下：
    毛主席来信了。
    长江欢笑，三镇沸腾，红旗漫卷，锣鼓震天。武汉军民同声欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信，昨天直接送到了武汉二百多万人民和湖北三千多万人民手中。
    毛主席、党中央的信，给武汉、湖北无产阶级革命派、革命的工农群众和广大指战员，带来了最亲切的关怀，最巨大的鼓舞。
    武汉，再一次沉浸在盛大的战斗的节日的欢腾中。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，是以您为首的党中央，给武汉地区无产阶级革命派和广大指战员为保卫您亲自领导、亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命、保卫您的光辉思想、保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，所进行的英勇斗争，以极高的评价，极大的支持。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，是以您为首的党中央，给武汉和全国的无产阶级文化大革命，再一次指明了前进的航向。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您亲自发动和领导了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。您亲自决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点燃了全国无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。在您的英明领导下，红卫兵运动，威震世界，为无产阶级文化大革命创建了不朽的功勋；上海“一月革命”的风暴，席卷全国，把无产阶级文化大革命推进到无产阶级革命派大联合，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的崭新阶段；《红旗》杂志发表的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》等三篇文章，吹响了向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动总攻击的进军号，无产阶级文化大革命的决战阶段到来了。
    敌人是不会自行消灭的。他们不甘心自己的灭亡，必然要做最后的垂死挣扎。中国的赫鲁晓夫在武汉地区的代理人——党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对武汉地区无产阶级革命派进行的猖狂反扑和镇压，最后一直发展到制造公开对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是这种垂死挣扎的集中反映。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人——党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和他们所操纵的“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，他们完全错误地估计了形势，搬起石头砸了自己的脚。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民和革命的新生力量是永远不可战胜的。
    在毛主席、林副主席和党中央的亲切关怀和正确领导下，无限忠于毛主席的英勇的无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员，英勇奋战，艰苦斗争，把敌人的阴谋迅速粉碎了。
    这是我国无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死决战阶段后，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所取得的又一伟大胜利！
    这一伟大的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产，最深刻地教育了广大革命群众，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命推向了新的胜利的阶段，它鼓舞着全国人民，全国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮开始了！
    在胜利的凯歌声中，我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，决不能忘记：党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，他们还妄图垂死挣扎，还妄图进行反扑。因此，我们一定要有清醒的头脑，千百倍地保持高度的革命警惕。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们武汉地区的广大工农兵群众、革命知识分子和革命干部，一定不辜负毛主席和党中央的期望，一定响应党中央的伟大号召，一定按照信中所提出的五项指示办事，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的旗帜下，在共同的斗争中，紧密地团结起来，打一场伟大的“人民战争”，把混进党内和无产阶级专政机构内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，统统揪出来，坚决斗倒、斗臭，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
