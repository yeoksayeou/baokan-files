From 1959 to 1962, the Chinese stage saw the emergence of anti-party "Hai Rui plays" such as "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne," "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Hai Rui Returns to Court," and "Hai Rui's Inspection Tour." In addition, anti-party "historical stories" and "historical sketches" like "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "The Story of Hai Rui" also appeared.

Why did a figure from several hundred years ago like Hai Rui arouse such great interest in certain people?

Why were they so eager to bring the corpse of Hai Rui onto the stage?

In November 1965, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was published, finally revealing the truth.

It turned out to be a sinister anti-party plot.

I

In 1958, under the radiant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, China launched a new high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving brilliant successes on all fronts.

A small clique of right-opportunists led by Peng Dehuai harbored a deep hatred for the socialist revolutionary cause. To achieve capitalist restoration in China, they took a reactionary stance, fiercely opposing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, attacking and slandering the Three Red Banners, attempting to completely negate the great achievements since 1958.

In August 1959, the Chinese Communist Party held its Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in Lushan. At the meeting, Peng Dehuai, claiming to be Hai Rui, raised the banner of "speaking for the people" and launched a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionist program, mounting a ferocious attack on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

"The ant climbing the locust tree boasts of its greatness, the cicada shaking the tree talks of ease." The attack by Peng Dehuai and his small clique of right-opportunists was thoroughly crushed. The Eighth Plenum solemnly declared: "From the very beginning, the imperialists and their running dogs have viciously slandered and attacked our total line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes movement. But they have failed miserably."

Like Peng Dehuai, China's Khrushchev has always been hostile to and opposed Mao Zedong Thought and the Three Red Banners, and is even more treacherous and poisonous than Peng Dehuai. After Peng Dehuai was dismissed, he remained undeterred and even more brazen, vigorously advocating "three freedoms and one contract," spreading the "wind of individual farming" and the "wind of rehabilitation," allowing ghosts and monsters to run amok, and even openly calling for the "rehabilitation" of Peng Dehuai. This situation reached its peak during the three years of difficulty.

At the call of China's Khrushchev, the domestic bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, ghosts, and monsters, as well as those right-opportunists who had been dismissed from office, thought that the "early spring weather" had arrived. They burst out of their doors, donned their makeup, and took to the stage, attempting to counterattack the revolutionary people and achieve capitalist restoration. It was under these circumstances that Zhou Yang, the agent of China's Khrushchev in the literary and artistic circles, following his master's instructions, plotted a grand scheme to stage "Hai Rui plays" and spread the "Hai Rui wind."

In the spring of 1959, Zhou Yang personally recommended the theme of "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" to the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Xinfan in Shanghai, saying that "Hai Rui is a remarkable figure, we should write a play about him," and that "now people don't dare to speak, performing such plays is necessary." He also praised Hai Rui as a "loyal and upright person with a strong sense of justice," a "clean official" in history who "loved the people," vigorously promoting the "spirit of Hai Rui." Soon, "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" was staged in Shanghai and became a key production. Zhou Yang watched it and exclaimed, "Well written, well performed."

Look, on one side, Peng Dehuai was claiming to be "Hai Rui" at the Lushan Conference, arrogantly demanding to "speak for the people"; on the other side, Zhou Yang was promoting "Hai Rui" on the stage, telling him not to be afraid and to "speak out."

How closely they collaborated!

Zhou Yang's vigorous promotion of "Hai Rui plays" was not out of a love for ancient history, but to make people "dare to speak," in other words, to let the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists speak out against the Party and socialism, daring to oppose Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, proletarian dictatorship, and the Three Red Banners, just like Peng Dehuai.

The veteran anti-communist Wu Han was not to be outdone. He "burst out of the door," using the slogan "learn from the past to serve the present," and after the Lushan Conference, he began to concoct the so-called "new historical drama" "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." In early 1961, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was officially staged.

The "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," which cried out for Peng Dehuai's dismissal, also received Zhou Yang's enthusiastic praise. He cunningly called on people to "cultivate the spirit of Hai Rui petitioning the throne." The "San Jian Village" brothers were also unable to contain their joy, running around telling each other, "Write another 'Hai Rui'!"

Sure enough, half a year later, another "Hai Rui play" appeared on the stage in Tianjin.

This was the final part of the "Hai Rui trilogy" following "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."

This was a piece in Zhou Yang's so-called "Hai Rui plays" "national chessboard."

This "Hai Rui play" was the Hebei Bangzi opera "Five-Colored Sedan."

II

"The Five-Colored Sedan" is an extremely malicious anti-party black play. It depicts the Ming Dynasty's Jiaqing period, where Hai Rui was demoted to the magistrate of Chun'an County. Just as the Minister of Salt, Yan Moqing, came to Zhejiang under the pretext of inspecting the salt administration, extorting and plundering the people's property. Hai Rui blocked Yan's way, using clever tricks to humiliate Yan, and fined Yan ten thousand taels of silver to relieve the suffering of the people. Finally, Yan left Chun'an in disgrace.

From "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to "The Five-Colored Sedan," a black line of anti-party and anti-socialism runs through them. They reflect the main activities of the right-opportunists from attacking the Party to suffering a crushing defeat, and then attempting to rehabilitate and rise again from 1959 to 1962.

If "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" was cheering and drumming for the right-opportunists' attack on the Party; "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was crying out for the dismissed right-opportunists, encouraging them to rise again and "restore order"; then "The Five-Colored Sedan" was, through Hai Rui's actions after being demoted, "restoring order" and "sweeping away evil," boosting the morale of the right-opportunists, inciting them to "try again after failure," and realizing their dream of capitalist restoration!

The author of "The Five-Colored Sedan" used the trick of criticizing the present through the past, attacking socialism. Right from the start, they used the mouth of Feng Lianfang, who was actually a landlord, rich peasant, counter-revolutionary, bad element, rightist, ghost, or monster, to curse our proletarian dictatorship state with gritted teeth: "The world is in chaos and not at peace, the strong easily oppress the weak," "traveling through all the states and counties, every family has a difficult script to read," "officials are ruthless in their administration, the strong oppress the weak, the powerless suffer hardships." Such counter-revolutionary language was so malicious and so blatant that it was even more vicious than the attacks by the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek who was barely surviving in Taiwan at the time.

In the play, the "just and impartial" "Great Judge" Hai Rui appears in this "chaotic and unstable world." At this time, he has been demoted to the magistrate of Chun'an County and is just taking office. We still remember that in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," the demoted Hai Rui sang, "If I have the chance to serve again, I will restore order." Cleverly, in "The Five-Colored Sedan," Hai Rui also sings, "I bear the heavy responsibility of governing the poor county and restoring order."

This is not a coincidence. One wants to "serve again and restore order," and the other wants to "bear the heavy responsibility" and "restore order," playing a "fantasy" for a small clique of right-opportunists who do not want to "retire from the historical stage" and are plotting to return.

The difference is that if "serving again and restoring order" in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was still just a wish, then in "The Five-Colored Sedan," it has been put into practice and achieved victory. This "victory" is naturally self-deception, a daytime dream, but it clearly shows the class enemy's plot to restore power.

Chairman Mao said: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves. ... They are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' to achieve their goals. Sometimes they will 'pretend to be dead and lie down,' waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack.'"

The "Hai Rui" in "The Five-Colored Sedan" is just like this. This demoted "Hai Rui" has not changed his "spirit of fighting to the end," but due to the changes in China's political situation after the Lushan Conference, this "Hai Rui" changed the counter-revolutionary strategy of bare-chested fighting in "Hai Rui Petitions the Throne" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and adopted another counter-revolutionary trick of "playing with," "making fun of," "concealing sharpness," and "being friendly with neighbors." It is not difficult to see that this is inciting the class enemy to play the counter-revolutionary two-faced game, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. This tactic is precisely the "Sun Wukong entering the belly" tactic used by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which is "publicly 'not to touch,' 'in possible places still to follow' the Party and the people; but secretly 'sharpening my sword, observing the direction.'"

The play tells the class enemy that using this tactic can achieve the victory of "restoring order" and "rising to the sky."

In short, the reactionary role of "The Five-Colored Sedan" is: on the one hand, it incites the class enemy to "try again after failure" and rise again; on the other hand, it teaches the class enemy the trick of playing the counter-revolutionary two-faced game. A reactionary academic "authority" said after watching "The Five-Colored Sedan": "One must have both courage and wisdom." It can be seen that "The Five-Colored Sedan" is a big poisonous weed full of poison, singing the "soul-returning song" for the overthrown right-opportunists, and shooting a poisoned arrow at the Chinese Communist Party and the proletarian dictatorship.

The Hai Rui in "The Five-Colored Sedan" once boasted proudly: "Do not laugh at the ants that can shake the mountain!" The cicada shaking the tree is laughable and self-deluded. Tell the "Hai Rui" of the 20th century, you are rejoicing too early! In an instant, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have stripped off your "red robes" and dug out your wolfish hearts!

III

Zhou Yang and his gang were the enthusiastic cheerleaders and directors of the anti-party black play "The Five-Colored Sedan."

After "The Five-Colored Sedan" was performed in Tianjin, it happened to be when Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and others were holding the "August Black Meeting" in Tianjin. Zhou Yang specifically requested to see "The Five-Colored Sedan."

Accompanied by some of his accomplices in Tianjin, Zhou Yang and others watched the performance of the Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe. For this play full of black words, Zhou Yang fully understood. He watched the play, sometimes whispering with Lin Mo-han, sometimes laughing heartily, clapping his hands in admiration.

After watching the play, Zhou Yang and his gang went on stage to meet the actors, shaking hands with each one to show encouragement. Zhou Yang also said to the actor playing Hai Rui: "You did well! You can add more singing, can't you? Sing a few more big pieces, let the audience enjoy it."

"Enjoy it," enjoy what? It is to arouse the deep hatred for the Party hidden in the hearts of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, using the malicious attacks on the Party to resonate with them.

Later, Zhou Yang said in a discussion with the leading actors and directors: "This play is quite good, it can be taken to Beijing to perform." Zhou Yang also said: "This play is even better than the Beijing 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'!" This remark revealed the secret of Zhou Yang's admiration for "The Five-Colored Sedan"!

Zhou Yang also said: "The last line of Hai Rui in the script is very unique and thought-provoking." The end of the script is as follows:

Hai Rui: Be careful on the road, sir.
Yan Moqing: Careful of what?
Hai Rui: Be careful of the five-colored sedan, madam!
Yan Moqing: This—
Hai Rui: Retire!

Those with discerning eyes can see that the author is using Hai Rui's mouth to warn us, the great Party, to "be careful," "not to be arrogant in the future," and "not to boast of power," in other words, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are going to take the stage and use bourgeois dictatorship to replace proletarian dictatorship. This is what Zhou Yang finds "thought-provoking."

Such an extremely malicious black play was not enough for Zhou Yang. He told the author: "The image of Hai Rui is not tall enough, can't the actor sing? We can add a few big pieces for him to sing, so that the audience can enjoy it and Hai Rui's impression on the audience will be deeper." Look, how deep Zhou Yang's feelings for "Hai Rui" are, he almost wants to make "Hai Rui" into a towering hero to satisfy his heart.

Later, Zhou Yang sent a reactionary academic "authority" to personally revise "The Five-Colored Sedan." This reactionary "authority" praised "The Five-Colored Sedan" as having "educational significance for today. One must have both courage and wisdom." He repeatedly emphasized that this play must have a "deep real basis." These words clearly show that "The Five-Colored Sedan" is not about the past for the sake of the past, nor is it purely about praising ancient people, but about reflecting reality, criticizing the present through the past, encouraging ghosts and monsters to "try again after failure," having both the "courage" and the "wisdom" to oppose the Party, this is the "educational significance" of "The Five-Colored Sedan" for today's landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists!

This reactionary academic "authority" also fiercely shouted: "Emphasize the sharpness of the struggle," "strike the enemy hard." He pointed out that the flaw of this play is that "the enemy seems easy to deal with." Look, these people who have been loudly advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of class reconciliation" have never really wanted to "extinguish" class struggle, have never wanted to reconcile classes, they are always thinking of seizing power from the proletariat, and we must not be too naive, simplifying the complex class struggle.

According to the instructions of Zhou Yang and his gang, the author carefully revised the script. The revised "The Five-Colored Sedan" became even more malicious. For example: When Hai Rui welcomed Yan Moqing, the original lyrics were: "I, Hai Rui, have never been worried about anything, learning from Dong Yuan to be strong and fearless of the powerful, angrily rushing to the heavenly official temple, the official holds justice and is unyielding." After the revision, it became: "The great ice mountain is not reliable? What fear of the wild storm sweeping the sky, comparable to the pine tree facing the frost and snow, the cold cannot break the waist of Tao Yuan. Let you be arrogant, let you be impatient, laugh and wait for spring to see you disappear."

Look! How malicious! How treacherous! They compared our great Communist Party to a "wild storm," "frost and snow," and the unshakable proletarian dictatorship to an "ice mountain." They went mad and shouted to "wait for spring to see you disappear." These counter-revolutionary words are not unfamiliar to us. We have heard them from the old right-wing writer Ilya Ehrenburg's "The Thaw," the outcries of the rightists in 1957, and the essays of "San Jian Village." Here, it concentrates on reflecting the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists' wild ambitions to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship.

"Asking the plague god where he is going? Paper boats and candles illuminate the sky and burn."

History is always ruthless to all reactionaries. In the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhou Yang and his gang finally revealed their true colors. This man who had always claimed to be a "Marxist" turned out to be a vanguard of the anti-party and anti-socialist forces under China's Khrushchev, the "ancestor" of the black line in literature and art. Zhou Yang and his gang once cursed our Party through the mouth of Hai Rui in "The Five-Colored Sedan": "Let you be arrogant, let you be impatient, laugh and wait for spring to see you disappear." In fact, these two sentences are an excellent portrayal of Zhou Yang and his gang of madmen.

    从“海瑞戏”《五彩轿》看周扬的狼子野心
    南开大学卫东　鲁迅文艺纵队
    从一九五九年到一九六二年，在我国戏曲舞台上，出现了《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞回朝》、《海瑞出巡》等反党的“海瑞戏”。此外，《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞的故事》等反党的“历史故事”、“历史小品”也纷纷出笼。
    为什么几百年前的一个海瑞引起了某些人如此之大的兴趣？
    为什么他们那样热中于把海瑞这具僵尸搬上舞台？
    一九六五年十一月，姚文元同志的文章《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》公开发表，才彻底揭开了这个谜底。
    原来这是一个阴险的反党阴谋。
    一
    一九五八年，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我国掀起了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮，各条战线都取得了极其辉煌的成就。
    以彭德怀为首的一小撮右倾机会主义分子对社会主义革命事业怀着刻骨的仇恨。为了在中国实现资本主义复辟，他们从资产阶级的反动立场出发，疯狂地反对党中央，反对毛主席，攻击、污蔑三面红旗，企图全盘否定一九五八年以来我们的伟大成绩。
    一九五九年八月，中国共产党在庐山召开了八届八中全会。会上，彭德怀自称海瑞，打着“为民请命”的旗号，抛出一个彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义纲领，向以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线发动了猖狂的进攻。
    “蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”彭德怀等一小撮右倾机会主义分子的进攻被彻底粉碎了。八届八中全会严正指出：“帝国主义者及其走狗，从一开始，就对我国建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动，进行了恶毒的污蔑和攻击。但是他们可耻地失败了。”
    同彭德怀一样，中国的赫鲁晓夫一向是仇视和反对毛泽东思想和三面红旗的，而且较之彭德怀更为阴险毒辣。彭德怀被罢官后，他仍不死心，而且变本加厉，大力宣扬“三自一包”、“四大自由”，大刮“单干风”、“翻案风”，放手让牛鬼蛇神出笼，甚至公然叫嚣要为彭德怀“翻案”。这种情况，在三年困难时期，达到了顶点。
    在中国的赫鲁晓夫的呼唤之下，国内的资产阶级、地富反坏右、牛鬼蛇神以及那些被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子，自以为“春草生，腊鼓鸣”的“早春天气”已经到来，于是纷纷破门而出，粉墨登场，妄图向革命人民反攻倒算，实现资本主义复辟。就在这种情况下，中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的代理人周扬秉承其主子的旨意，策划了一个大演“海瑞戏”，大刮“海瑞风”的阴谋。
    一九五九年春，周扬在上海亲自向反革命修正主义分子周信芳推荐《海瑞上疏》的题材，说什么“海瑞是个了不起的人物，要编个戏演演”，说什么“现在大家不敢讲话，演一演这类戏是需要的。”他还到处吹捧海瑞是“忠心耿耿，富有正义感的高尚人物”，是历史上“爱民”的“清官”，竭力鼓吹“海瑞精神”。不久，《海瑞上疏》在上海出笼，并被当作重点剧目，周扬看后拍案叫绝，大叫“写得好，演得好。”
    看吧，一边是彭德怀在庐山会议上自称“海瑞”，气势汹汹地要“为民请命”；一边是周扬把“海瑞”捧上戏曲舞台，叫他“不要怕，该憎就憎，该讲就讲”。
    这一切配合得何等的密切！
    周扬大力提倡“海瑞戏”，绝不是在抒发思古之幽情，而是为了使人们“敢讲话”，换言之，就是要资产阶级、地富反坏右大讲反党反社会主义的黑话，敢于象彭德怀那样公然反对毛主席，反对党中央，反对无产阶级专政和三面红旗。
    反共老手吴晗也不甘落后，他“破门而出”，打起“古为今用”的幌子，在庐山会议之后动手炮制所谓“新编历史剧”《海瑞罢官》。一九六一年初《海瑞罢官》正式出笼了。
    为彭德怀的罢官喊冤叫屈的《海瑞罢官》也获得了周扬的节节赞赏，他别有用心地号召人们“要培养海瑞上本的精神”。“三家村”的难兄难弟们也按捺不住心头的喜悦，奔走相告，大叫“再写一个‘海瑞’！”
    果不其然，时过半载，又一个“海瑞戏”出现在天津市的戏曲舞台上。
    这是继《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞罢官》之后的“海瑞戏”三部曲的最后一部。
    这是周扬的所谓“海瑞戏”“全国一盘棋”中的一个棋子。这个“海瑞戏”就是河北梆子《五彩轿》。
    二
    《五彩轿》是一出极其恶毒的反党黑戏。它写的是明朝嘉靖年间，海瑞降于淳安知县，适逢总理盐政鄢懋卿来浙江借巡查盐政为名，敲榨勒索，搜刮民财。海瑞挡了鄢的驾，用“耍笑”、“周旋”的巧妙办法作弄了鄢，并罚了鄢一万两的银子，赈济灾民，最后鄢狼狈不堪地离淳安而去。
    从《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞罢官》到《五彩轿》，贯穿着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。它反映了一九五九年到一九六二年这段期间内，右倾机会主义分子由向党进攻到遭到惨败，再到企图翻案和东山再起三个阶段的主要活动。
    如果说《海瑞上疏》是为右倾机会主义分子向党的进攻摇旗呐喊，击鼓助威；《海瑞罢官》是为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，鼓励他们东山再起，“重整纪纲”；那么《五彩轿》则是通过海瑞被贬官后“整顿纲常”的作为和“扫奸邪”的大获全胜，为右倾机会主义分子壮胆鼓气，煽动他们“失败了再干”，实现他们复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦！
    《五彩轿》的作者运用借古讽今、指桑骂槐的惯技，恶毒地攻击社会主义制度。一开场，他们就借实际上是地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神化身的冯莲芳之口，咬牙切齿地咒骂我们无产阶级专政的国家是“世道纷纭不安宁，强者易生弱难存”，“走遍天下州和郡，家家有本难念经”，“官吏横行政事苛，众暴寡来强凌弱，无权无势受坎坷”。这种反革命的语言，是这样的恶毒，这样的露骨，比起当时国际上帝、修、反和苟延残喘于台湾的蒋介石对我们的攻击，有过之而无不及。
    剧中的“执法如山”，“刚正无私”的“青天大老爷”海瑞，就是在这种“世道纷纭不安宁”的情况下出场的。这时他被贬为淳安知县，正走马上任。我们还记得，在《海瑞罢官》中，被罢了官的海瑞高唱“有一日再居官重整纪纲”；巧妙不过的是《五彩轿》中的海瑞一出场，也高唱“肩重任治穷乡整顿纲常”。
    这绝非凑巧。一个要“再居官重整纪纲”，一个要“肩重任”“整顿纲常”，演奏出一小撮右倾机会主义分子不肯“自行退出历史舞台”，图谋卷土重来的“畅想曲”。
    所不同的是，如果说，“再居官重整纪纲”在《海瑞罢官》中还仅仅是一种愿望的话，那么，到了《五彩轿》已经付诸实践，并取得胜利。这种“胜利”自然纯系自欺欺人，白日作梦，但却清楚地表现了阶级敌人阴谋复辟的狼子野心。
    毛主席说过：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。……他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。”
    《五彩轿》中的“海瑞”就是这样。这个被贬官的“海瑞”死干到底的“骨气”没有变，但是，由于庐山会议以后我国政治形势的变化，这个“海瑞”改变了《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞罢官》中那种赤膊上阵的反革命策略，而采取了另一种“与他周旋”、“趁机耍笑”、“敛锋芒”、“睦乡邻”的反革命手腕。不难看出，这是在唆使阶级敌人大搞反革命两面派，打着“红旗”反红旗。这种手段正是当年胡风反革命集团所采用的“公开的是‘不要去碰’，‘可能的地方还要顺着’党和人民；而暗中却更加紧地‘磨我的剑，窥测方向’”的“孙行者钻进肚皮去”的战术。剧本告诉阶级敌人，用这种战术可以实现“整顿纲常”、“一举冲霄”的胜利。
    总之，《五彩轿》的反动作用在于：一方面鼓动阶级敌人“失败了再干”，东山再起；一方面向阶级敌人献玩弄反革命两面派手法之计。一个反动学术“权威”看过《五彩轿》之后说：“既要有勇气，又要有智慧”。由此可见，《五彩轿》是一株饱含毒汁的反党反社会主义的大毒草。它替被打倒的右倾机会主义分子唱起“魂兮归来”的招魂曲，它向中国共产党和无产阶级专政射出了一支毒箭。
    《五彩轿》中的海瑞曾得意洋洋地叫嚣：“休笑那蝼蚁小能撼泰山！”蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。告诉二十世纪的“海瑞”们，你们高兴得太早了！曾几何时，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民便剥下了你们的“大红袍”，挖出了你们的狼心狗肺！
    三
    周扬一伙是反党黑戏《五彩轿》的狂热吹鼓手和总导演。
    《五彩轿》在天津市公演之后，正值周扬、林默涵等人在天津开“八月黑会”之际。周扬指名要看《五彩轿》。
    在天津市一些狐群狗党的陪同下，周扬等人观看了河北梆子剧院一团的演出。对这个黑话连篇的黑戏，周扬完全心领神会。他看着戏，时而同林默涵窃窃私语，时而哈哈大笑，抚掌叫绝。
    看过戏后，周扬一伙上台接见演员，一一握手，以示鼓励。周扬并对扮演海瑞的演员说：“你演的不错呀！还可以多加点唱，你不是能唱吗？多唱几大板，让观众听了也过过瘾。”
    “过过瘾”，“过”什么“瘾”？就是唤起地、富、反、坏、右埋藏在心头的那种对党的刻骨仇恨，用对党的恶毒攻击来引起他们的共鸣。
    事后，周扬在同主演、导演座谈时，说什么“这个剧目就不错嘛，可以拿到北京去演。”周扬又说：“这个戏比北京《海瑞罢官》还要好！”一语泄露了周扬如此欣赏《五彩轿》的天机！
    周扬还说：“剧本最后海瑞的一句话很别致，耐人寻味。”剧本的末尾是这样的：
    海瑞：大人路上要小心了。
    鄢懋卿：小心甚么？
    海瑞：小心夫人的五彩轿哇！
    鄢懋卿：这——
    海瑞：退堂！
    明眼人一看便知，作者是借海瑞之口，警告我们伟大的党要“小心”，“今后行事莫狂妄”，不要“自夸权势”，也就是说，地、富、反、坏、右要上台，要用资产阶级专政来代替无产阶级专政。这就是周扬感到“耐人寻味”的地方。
    这样一出恶毒之极的黑戏，周扬犹嫌不足。他对作者说：“海瑞的形象不够高大，演员不是能唱吗？可以给他安几大板唱，叫观众听了能过瘾，海瑞给观众的印象也就更深了。”看吧，周扬对“海瑞”的感情何等之深，简直要把“海瑞”塑造成顶天立地的大丈夫才能称心。
    后来，周扬还派一个反动学术“权威”亲自修改《五彩轿》。这个反动“权威”吹捧《五彩轿》“对今天来说，也有教育意义。既要有勇气，又要有智慧。”并反复强调这个戏要“有深刻的现实根据。”这一番话，清楚地表明，《五彩轿》根本不是为古而古，不是单纯地赞美古人，而是影射现实，借古讽今，鼓励牛鬼蛇神“失败了再干”，既要有反党的“勇气”，又要有反党的“智慧”，这就是《五彩轿》对今天的地、富、反、坏、右的“教育意义”！
    这个反动学术“权威”还恶狠狠地叫嚷：“要强调斗争的尖锐性”，“对敌人的打击要狠”。他指出这个戏的缺点是“感到敌人好对付”。请看，这些大肆宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“阶级调和论”的家伙，实际上从来也不想“熄灭”阶级斗争，从来也不想搞阶级“调和”，他们无时无刻不在想着夺无产阶级的权，我们“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”。
    《五彩轿》的作者根据周扬一伙的指点，对剧本又作了精心的修改。修改之后的《五彩轿》更为恶毒。比如：海瑞迎接鄢懋卿时，原来的唱词是：“我海瑞遇事从来不担心，学董宣作强项不畏权豪，怒冲冲来至在天官神庙，官员小持正义不屈不挠。”修改后变成：“巍巍冰山岂可靠？何惧漫天起狂飙，堪比苍松把霜雪傲，严寒摧不折陶公腰。任尔骄，任尔躁，笑待春来看尔消。”
    看！多么恶毒！多么阴险！他们把我们伟大的共产党比作“狂飙”，“霜雪”，把坚如磐石的无产阶级专政比作“冰山”，他们丧心病狂地喊叫要“笑待春来看尔消”。这种反革命词句我们听起来并不陌生，我们从苏联老牌右派作家爱伦堡的《解冻》，一九五七年右派分子的叫嚣和“三家村”杂文中早已听到过了。在这里，集中反映了资产阶级、地富反坏以及右倾机会主义分子妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的狼子野心。
    “借问瘟君欲何往？纸船明烛照天烧。”
    历史对于一切反动派总是无情的。在无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流中，周扬一伙终于露出原形。这个一直以“马克思主义者”自居的家伙，原来是中国的赫鲁晓夫麾下的一员反党反社会主义的急先锋，是文艺黑线的“祖师爷”。周扬们曾借《五彩轿》中海瑞的口大骂我们党：“任尔骄，任尔躁，笑待春来看尔消。”其实，这两句话恰好是周扬这批狂人的绝妙写照。
