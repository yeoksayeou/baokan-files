Shanghai's renowned machine and electrical equipment factory, the Shanghai Pioneer Electric Motor Factory, has made a great leap in production by vigorously carrying out a revolutionary critique, promoting the ideological transformation of the people, and creating a new situation in production. In the first half of this year, the factory has fully and over-fulfilled the state's plan in terms of quality, quantity, and variety. The total production value in the second quarter increased by 68% compared to the same period last year. The output of the main product, medium-frequency motors, increased by more than one fold, and the output of variable-speed motors reached an all-time high. The production situation in the third quarter is also very good. These great achievements are a triumph of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the "January Revolution" storm, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Pioneer Electric Motor Factory seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. After taking power, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have achieved the goal of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, with revolution leading production, and with the ideological transformation of the people promoting the great leap in production.

"The political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Pioneer Electric Motor Factory deeply understands that revolution is the locomotive driving history forward. To do well in production, one must emphasize politics and carry out the revolution. And the most important political task at present is to deeply carry out the revolutionary critique movement. Therefore, despite the heavy production tasks, the factory's revolutionary critique is carried out with great enthusiasm.

Through the efforts of the proletarian revolutionary faction and all revolutionary workers of the factory, the shortage of 110,000 work-hours in the second quarter was overcome on the basis of emphasizing proletarian politics and achieving the ideological transformation of the people. The original production plan and the newly added production tasks were all completed. The revolution and production of the entire factory are thriving, presenting a very good situation.

    上海先锋电机厂生产大跃进
    上海著名的机电工厂——上海先锋电机厂无产阶级革命派，狠抓革命的大批判，促进人的思想革命化，创造了生产大跃进的新局面。这个厂今年上半年按质、按量、按品种全面超额完成了国家计划。二季度的生产总值比去年同期增长百分之六十八，主要产品中频电机的产量比去年同期增加一倍以上，变速电机的产量达到了历史上的最高水平。三季度以来生产情况也很好。这些巨大成就，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    在“一月革命”风暴中，上海先锋电机厂无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺了权。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，在解放军的帮助下，全厂革命职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们做到了用毛泽东思想指导一切，以革命统帅生产，以人的思想革命化来促进生产的大跃进。
      “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”先锋电机厂的无产阶级革命派深深懂得，革命是推动历史前进的火车头。要把生产搞好，必须突出政治，抓好革命。而当前最大的政治，就是深入地开展革命的大批判运动。因此，尽管生产任务十分繁重，全厂的大批判照样搞得热火朝天。
    经过无产阶级革命派和全厂革命职工的努力，在突出无产阶级政治和实现人的思想革命化的基础上，二季度缺少十一万个工时的困难克服了。原定的生产计划和新增的生产任务都完成了。全厂的革命和生产蓬勃向上，呈现着一片大好形势。
