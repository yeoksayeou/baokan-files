Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the Party's Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenary Session, the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" issued at the session, and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" personally directed by him, all of which have epoch-making significance. They have opened up a victorious road for revolution under the historical conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our socialist revolution has entered a deeper and broader new stage, and the world has entered a new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, after a year of fierce struggle, we have achieved the greatest possible results with the smallest possible cost. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about earth-shaking changes in our country. Our proletarian dictatorship has never been as consolidated as it is today, and our country has never been as strong as it is today. Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenary Session amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism, our hearts are filled with extraordinary excitement and emotion. Countless thoughts and feelings converge into one point: we have a deeper understanding of the infinite greatness of Chairman Mao, the infinite greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, and the infinite greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Countless words condense into one vow: we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

What attitude one holds towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is a matter of supreme principle and the most fundamental issue of stance. It is the most fundamental criterion for distinguishing between revolutionaries, non-revolutionaries, and counter-revolutionaries. Mao Zedong Thought is our highest interest and highest principle, our first life and first need. For all eternity, Chairman Mao will forever be our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. No matter how the heavens and earth change, our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change. We will spend our lives "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao." We will spend our lives being fighters and propagandists defending Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, using it to guide everything, direct everything, and transform everything. Chairman Mao's books, words, and revolutionary practices are the highest instructions and the most brilliant examples. For us, the most important thing is to carry them out resolutely. We must carry them out in everything, at all times, and in all places; we must carry them out ourselves and mobilize the masses to carry them out; we must carry them out honestly and energetically.

Chairman Mao is the most outstanding and greatest genius in history, both domestically and internationally. Mao Zedong Thought is the summation of the experiences of the proletarian struggle both domestically and internationally, the crystallization of human wisdom, an unshakable truth, and a far-sighted scientific prediction. When we carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, we must not make our own understanding a precondition. Revolutionary struggle experience tells us that many of Chairman Mao's instructions we often do not understand or understand very little at the beginning, but only gradually deepen our understanding in the process of carrying them out or after carrying them out, or even years later. Therefore, we must carry out Chairman Mao's instructions whether we understand them or not. Chairman Mao's words are absolutely correct, ten thousand times correct. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works and act strictly according to Chairman Mao's teachings, this is the greatest ability and the highest level.

The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is critical and revolutionary. Its fundamental point is to criticize, to struggle, and to revolutionize. Our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao should be prominently manifested in our resolute and courageous struggle against the enemy. Especially at critical moments of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must fight fearlessly and unhesitatingly to defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Lin Biao calls on us to study Chairman Mao's works, "to study with problems in mind, to study and apply actively, to combine study with use, to study urgently what is needed immediately, to see results quickly, and to focus on the 'use' aspect." This is to call on us to study in struggle and to apply in struggle, to focus on the "struggle" aspect. Comrade Lin Biao instructs us to strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. The primary task is to strengthen our revolutionary spirit, to put "revolution" first and "struggle" first. Only through struggle can Mao Zedong Thought unleash its immense power and become a great material force to transform the world; only through struggle can we truly learn Mao Zedong Thought, increase our unlimited love for Chairman Mao, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. We must transform our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao into an intense hatred for the class enemy and an unyielding courage to fight the enemy. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, or opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our sworn enemy, and we must resolutely overthrow them. No matter how great the difficulties, risks, or pressures we encounter, we must dare to persist in struggle and resist the current.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, and relative, while the struggle of opposites to exclude each other is absolute." In class society, class struggle and line struggle will never cease. Our struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will also never end, and we must continue to struggle. We communists spend our lives fighting class struggles. If we abandon class struggle and detach ourselves from class struggle, we are actually allowing the bourgeoisie to seize our power.

Different revolutionary periods have different objects of struggle. Today, the most dangerous enemy within our country is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their representative. They are a bunch of revisionist counter-revolutionaries and the main targets of our revolutionary struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has exposed them and achieved great victories. However, like cornered beasts, the enemy will not willingly admit defeat. They will struggle with tenfold cunning and a hundredfold frenzy in their dying throes, sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and counterattacking the proletarian headquarters and revolutionary masses. A snake that is not killed will cause harm. An injured tiger is much more ferocious than an uninjured one. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are "striking snakes" and "injured tigers." We must not allow them to catch their breath and recover, only to return with a vengeance. We must fiercely and thoroughly fight them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that they never rise again, completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters, and thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots. The more fiercely and thoroughly we fight them, the more consolidated the proletarian dictatorship will be, the more the socialist revolutionary cause will develop, the stronger our country will be, and the more secure the victory of the world revolution will be.

After more than a year of testing by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has been proven that the vast majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. These comrades are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Of course, there are also people who say they are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, but their loyalty is mainly in words rather than actions. Especially at the most intense moments of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they either have ambiguous attitudes or are full of concerns and dare not stand up, and some even retreat from the battlefield. Such people are not true proletarian revolutionaries. Some people have once charged into the enemy's ranks and fought bravely. However, their worldviews have not been transformed or have not been well transformed, and they are not self-aware but rather think they are perfect and regard themselves as heroes; when they enter the stage of socialist revolution, their flaws become more and more apparent. Some of them have increasingly heavy personal desires, so their feelings for the proletarian revolutionary faction become more and more distant, their hatred for the enemy becomes more and more faint, they lose their fighting spirit, stop struggling, live on past merits, do not achieve new successes, and even become obstacles to the revolution; some have turned into power-holders taking the capitalist road and become the main targets of revolutionary struggle. These lessons are very profound.

Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is not only manifested in being extremely courageous in the struggle against the enemy but also in daring to struggle against the "self" in one's mind. Mao Zedong Thought is a communist ideological system that is incompatible with bourgeois ideology. The struggle between the two worldviews is essentially the reflection in our minds of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Those who are truly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will not allow any non-proletarian thoughts to interfere with Mao Zedong Thought in their minds and will not show mercy to the "self" in their minds. On the battlefield of class struggle, we must be heroes who have "me" but no enemies, and on the battlefield of ideological transformation, we must be brave warriors who break with the "self" and establish the public. The struggle against the enemy can never stop, and the transformation of oneself can never be relaxed. We must resolutely carry out Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself." If we do not regard ourselves as a force for revolution while consciously regarding ourselves as an object of revolution, that is, revolutionizing our thoughts and the "self" in our minds, we will turn from a driving force for revolution into an obstacle to revolution. We must unite the struggle against the enemy with the struggle against the "self" in our minds, transforming the objective world while transforming the subjective world.

Whether one can correctly treat oneself to a large extent depends on whether one can correctly treat one's achievements and mistakes in work. All the achievements we have made should be attributed to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. While all the mistakes we have made are due to our failure to fully understand and carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Making mistakes is inevitable, but as long as one corrects them seriously, it will be all right." Whether a cadre is truly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought mainly depends on whether, after making mistakes, he seriously examines and thoroughly corrects them. Making mistakes and then seriously examining and thoroughly correcting them is a manifestation of loyalty to the revolutionary cause and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If one insists on not correcting mistakes and continues down the wrong path, it will be very dangerous. The history of the struggle between the two lines within our Party shows that those who insist on not correcting mistakes or use two-faced tactics are two-hearted with Chairman Mao and two-hearted with the revolutionary cause, and they will not have a good end.

Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao must also be manifested in supporting and loving the revolutionary leftists. Correctly treating the masses is a fundamental issue of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary actions of the masses the most, and he is heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses also love Chairman Mao the most and are loyal to Chairman Mao the most. They are the bravest, most resolute, and wisest in their struggle against the enemy; they are the true heroes. We must love what they love, hate what they hate, think what they think, and be concerned about what they are concerned about. We must always stand with them, rely on them closely, humbly learn from them, and be their little students.

To connect with the masses and go deep among the masses, we must arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Leadership work has thousands of tasks, but the most important, fundamental, frequent, and largest in quantity is to carry out Mao Zedong Thought education among the masses, carry out class struggle and two-line struggle education, launch a mass movement to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, cultivate the masses' unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and deepen the masses' intense hatred for the class enemy. Only in this way can we ensure that the broad masses in the regions, units, or departments we lead are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, especially at critical moments of struggle, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must take Comrade Lin Biao as an example. Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms and best student. For decades, he has never left Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, most resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, most enthusiastically spread Mao Zedong Thought, and most bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must forever learn from Comrade Lin Biao and, like Comrade Lin Biao, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive bravely for the thorough victory of Mao Zedong Thought in all of China and the world!

    永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    吴法宪
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的八届十一中全会、在全会上发表的《炮打司令部》的大字报、亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，具有划时代的伟大意义，开辟了在无产阶级专政的历史条件下进行革命的胜利道路。我国社会主义革命进入了更深入、更广阔的新阶段，全世界进入了毛泽东思想的新时代。在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，经过一年来的激烈搏斗，我们以最小最小最小的代价，取得了最大最大最大的成绩。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使我国发生了翻天覆地的变化。我们的无产阶级专政，从来没有现在这样巩固，我们的国家，从来没有现在这样强大。今天，当我们在革命大批判的高潮中庆祝党的八届十一中全会一周年的时候，心情是异常兴奋、异常激动的。千思万感，集中到一点，就是更加深刻地体会到毛主席无限伟大，毛泽东思想无限伟大，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限伟大；千言万语，凝结成一个誓言，我们要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    对毛主席、对毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线抱什么态度，是高于一切的大节问题，是最根本的立场问题。这是区分革命、不革命或反革命的最根本的标准，毛泽东思想是我们的最高利益和最高原则，是我们的第一生命和第一需要。千秋万代，毛主席永远是我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手。天变地变，我们忠于毛主席的红心永远不变。我们要一辈子“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。我们要一辈子当保卫毛泽东思想的战斗员、宣传员。要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切。毛主席的书，毛主席的话，毛主席的革命实践，都是最高的指示，最光辉的榜样。对于我们来说，最重要的就是坚决照办。要事事照办，时时照办，处处照办；自己照办，发动群众照办；老老实实地照办，雷厉风行地照办。
    毛主席是古今中外最杰出最伟大的天才，毛泽东思想是国内外无产阶级斗争经验的总结，是人类智慧的结晶，是颠扑不破的真理，是高瞻远瞩的科学预见。我们执行毛主席的指示，绝不能以自己是否理解为前提。革命斗争的经验告诉我们，毛主席的很多指示，我们开始往往不甚理解或很不理解，而是在执行过程中或执行以后，甚至若干年之后，才逐步地加深理解。所以，对毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，一时还不理解的也要坚决执行。毛主席的话，一千万个对，一万万个对。一个人能力有大小，但是，只要刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，不折不扣地按照毛主席的教导办事，这就是最大的本事，最高的水平。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是批判的、革命的。它的基本点就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。我们对毛主席的无限忠诚，应该突出地表现在对敌人坚决勇敢地斗争。特别是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的紧要关头，要奋不顾身地进行斗争，毫不犹豫地保卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。林彪副主席号召我们：学习毛主席著作，“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”就是要我们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在“斗”字上狠下功夫。林副主席指示我们要加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性。首要的是加强革命性，要“革”字当头，“斗”字当头。只有通过斗争，毛泽东思想才能发挥无比强大的威力，变成改造世界的伟大物质力量；只有通过斗争，我们才能真正学到毛泽东思想，才能增强对毛主席的无限热爱，才能大立毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，才能保卫毛泽东思想。我们要把对毛主席的无限忠诚，化为对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，化为对敌斗争的无比勇敢。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是我们不共戴天的敌人，就要坚决把他打倒。不管遇到多大的困难，冒多大的风险，受多大的压力，都要敢于坚持斗争，顶住逆流。
    毛主席教导我们：“对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、相对的，而对立的互相排除的斗争则是绝对的。”在阶级社会里，阶级斗争，路线斗争，永远不会停止。我们保卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的斗争，也是永远不会完结的，要一直斗争下去。我们共产党人一辈子就是干阶级斗争的。如果放弃阶级斗争，脱离阶级斗争，实际上就是容忍资产阶级篡夺我们的政权。
    不同的革命时期，有不同的斗争对象。今天，我们国内最危险的敌人，是以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们是一批反革命的修正主义分子，是我们革命斗争的主要对象。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把他们揭露出来，取得了伟大的胜利。但是，困兽犹斗，敌人是不会甘心失败的。他们会以十倍的狡猾，百倍的疯狂进行垂死挣扎，对无产阶级文化大革命实行破坏，对无产阶级司令部和革命群众进行反扑。打蛇不死，反受其害。受伤的老虎，比没有受伤的老虎更要残暴得多。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是“挨打的毒蛇”，“受伤的老虎”，决不能让他们得到喘息，把伤养好，卷土重来。我们要从政治上、思想上、理论上猛斗狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们斗得永世不得翻身，把资产阶级司令部彻底捣毁，把修正主义根子彻底挖掉。我们对他们斗得越狠，越彻底，无产阶级政权就越巩固，社会主义革命事业就越发展，我们的国家就越强大，世界革命的胜利就越有保证。
    经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的考验，证明我们的干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。这些同志是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。当然也有这样的人，他们也说忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，但是，他们主要是表现在口头上而不是表现在行动上。特别是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最激烈的时刻，他们或者态度暧昧，或者顾虑重重，不敢挺身而出，有的甚至临阵脱逃。这种人，不是真正的无产阶级革命者。有的人过去曾经在对敌斗争中冲过锋，陷过阵。但是，他们的世界观没有得到改造或没有得到很好的改造，而且他们很不自觉，反而自以为完满无缺，以功臣自居；当进入社会主义革命阶段以后，他们的毛病就越来越突出了。其中有的私心越来越重，因而对无产阶级革命派的感情越来越疏远，对敌人的仇恨越来越淡薄，丧失了斗志，停止了斗争，光吃老本，不立新功，以至变成了革命的阻力；有的则变为走资本主义道路的当权派，成了革命斗争的主要对象。这些教训是十分深刻的。
    无限忠于毛主席，不仅表现在对敌斗争无比勇敢，而且表现在敢于同自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争。毛泽东思想是共产主义的思想体系，同资产阶级思想是水火不相容的。两种世界观的斗争，实质上就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在我们头脑中的反映。真正忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人，绝不容许自己头脑中有任何非无产阶级思想干扰毛泽东思想，绝不能对自己头脑中的“私”字留情。在阶级斗争的战场上，我们要做有我无敌的英雄，在思想改造的战场上，我们要做破私立公的勇士。对敌人的斗争永远不能停止，对自己的改造也永远不能放松。我们要坚决执行林副主席的指示：“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。”我们如果不把自己当作革命的一份力量的同时，自觉地把自己当作革命的对象，即革自己思想的命、革自己头脑中“私”字的命，那就会由革命的动力变成革命的阻力。我们要把对敌斗争和对自己头脑中“私”字的斗争统一起来，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。
    能否正确地对待自己，在很大程度上取决于能否正确对待自己工作中的成绩和错误。我们所取得的一切成绩，都应当归功于毛主席，归功于毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。而我们所犯的一切错误，则无不是由于没有很好地领会和执行毛主席的指示。毛主席教导我们：“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。”一个干部是否真正忠于毛泽东思想，主要的不是看他是否不犯错误，而是看他犯了错误以后，是否认真检查，彻底改正。犯了错误就认真检查，彻底改正，这是忠于革命事业的表现，是忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的表现。如果坚持不改，沿着错误的道路走下去，那就很危险了。我们党内两条路线斗争的历史表明，凡是坚持不肯改正错误，或者阳奉阴违、耍两面手法的人，都是和毛主席两条心的、和革命事业两条心的，都没有好下场。
    对毛主席的无限忠诚，还必须表现在对革命左派的支持和热爱。正确地对待群众，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本问题。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命行动，和革命群众心连心。广大革命群众也最热爱毛主席，最忠于毛主席。他们对敌斗争最勇敢，最坚决，最有智慧，他们是真正的英雄。我们必须爱他们所爱，恨他们所恨，想他们所想，急他们所急，始终和他们站在一起，紧紧地依靠他们，虚心向他们学习，甘当他们的小学生。
    联系群众、深入群众，要用毛泽东思想武装群众，树立毛主席的绝对权威，树立毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。领导工作有千件万件，最重要、最根本、最经常、最大量的是要在群众中进行毛泽东思想的教育，进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，培养群众对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，加深群众对阶级敌人的无比憎恨。只有这样，才能保证自己所领导的地区、单位或部门的广大群众，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，特别是在斗争的紧要关头，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要以林副主席为榜样。林副主席是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生。几十年来，他一时一刻没有离开毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，刻苦地学习毛主席著作，最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，最热情地传播毛泽东思想，最英勇地保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们要永远向林副主席学习，象林副主席那样，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为毛泽东思想在全中国和全世界的彻底胜利而英勇奋斗！
