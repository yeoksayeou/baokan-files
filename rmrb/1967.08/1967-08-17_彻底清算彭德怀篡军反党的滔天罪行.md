In August 1959, the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, held at Mount Lu, successfully crushed the brazen attack by the anti-Party clique led by Peng Dehuai. It thwarted their plot to seize the military, the Party, and the state, and to restore capitalism, thereby safeguarding the Party's socialist construction line and eliminating a major hidden danger within the Party. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. This victory dealt a heavy blow to the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and had profound historical significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship, for promoting the deep development of the socialist cause, and for the struggle against modern revisionism.

After the Mount Lu Conference, Peng Dehuai persisted in his reactionary bourgeois stance, playing a double game with the Party. While superficially making some "self-criticisms," he harbored deep hatred for the Party and continued his anti-Party activities, waiting for an opportunity to launch a new attack on the Party.

In 1962, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries launched a new wave of anti-China actions. The Soviet revisionists carried out subversive activities in our border regions, the Indian reactionaries provoked armed provocations on our borders, and the U.S. imperialists instigated the Kuomintang bandits to plot an invasion of the mainland. China's Khrushchev, in collusion with domestic and foreign ghosts and demons, took advantage of our temporary difficulties to viciously attack the Three Red Banners, advocating "three surrenders and one annihilation," "three reconciliations and one reduction," and "three independences and one contract." They spread the winds of individual farming and case reversal, launching a full-scale attack on the Party and socialism from the political, economic, and ideological fronts. With the support and encouragement of China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai threw out an 80,000-word book of case reversal, closely coordinating with China's Khrushchev to launch another brazen attack on the Party.

Peng Dehuai has never been a Marxist; he is a great conspirator and opportunist who infiltrated the Party, a thoroughgoing hypocrite, an old opportunist, and a revisionist. He is the biggest representative within the Party of those who take the capitalist road and is the agent of the capitalist roaders in our army. In the Party's major line struggles, Peng Dehuai has always stood on the wrong side, opposing Mao Zedong's correct line. We must thoroughly settle the accounts of Peng Dehuai's heinous crimes of opposing our great leader Mao Zedong, opposing great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line.

During the period of the democratic revolution, he consistently opposed the correct line represented by Mao Zedong and consistently opposed great Mao Zedong Thought.

Before Peng Dehuai infiltrated our Party and army, he was an old officer with extremely arrogant personal ambitions. He had spent twelve whole years in the warlord army. He once named himself "Peng Dehua" and took the character "Shi Chuan," meaning to obtain "China" with the spirit of "water dripping through stone" to become king and emperor. Peng Dehuai joined the Party and participated in the Pingjiang Uprising, taking advantage of the revolution to realize his ambition of "obtaining China." This opportunist was filled with bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist ideas, with not a trace of Marxism-Leninism. For over thirty years, his bourgeois worldview and bourgeois stance have not changed at all. In his mind, there is no Party, no Mao Zedong, no masses, no proletariat; everything revolves around him, making him an extreme personal opportunist. All he thinks about is to transform the Party and the army in the image of the bourgeoisie. Peng Dehuai has always opposed Mao Zedong, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line.

In June 1930, the "Left" opportunist line represented by Li Lisan controlled the Party Central Committee. They opposed Mao Zedong's correct line of creating rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and pushing the national revolutionary high tide from the base areas. They erroneously formulated a reckless plan for armed uprisings in major cities nationwide and for concentrating the Red Army to attack major cities. Peng Dehuai was a staunch supporter and active executor of this military adventurist plan. His idea of not needing base areas, attacking big cities, and fighting big battles was completely in line with the Li Lisan line. He attempted to rely on and utilize the Li Lisan line to realize his ambition of expanding his personal influence. He was the representative in the Red Army who firmly executed the Li Lisan line and opposed Mao Zedong's correct line.

After the Li Lisan line was corrected, the Red Army in the Central Soviet Area, under Mao Zedong's correct leadership, successively crushed the enemy's first, second, and third "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. The base areas developed, and the Red Army grew stronger. A new high tide of the national democratic movement against Japanese imperialist aggression emerged nationwide. However, at this time, a more "Left" erroneous line than the Li Lisan line formed within the Party, which was the first Wang Ming line. From the Fourth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1931 to the Enlarged Political Bureau Meeting of the Party Central Committee held in Zunyi, Guizhou, in January 1935, this erroneous line dominated the Party for four years, causing the revolutionary base areas and the Red Army to suffer a loss of ninety percent, and the Party's work in the white areas to suffer almost one hundred percent loss. Peng Dehuai was a firm executor of the first Wang Ming line. He strongly opposed and excluded Mao Zedong's correct line. The first Wang Ming line was able to be implemented in the Central Soviet Area, and Peng Dehuai played a very vicious role.

In January 1935, at the Enlarged Meeting of the Central Political Bureau held in Zunyi, Guizhou, the domination of the first Wang Ming line in the Party Central Committee ended, and Mao Zedong's leadership position in the entire Party was established. This was the most historically significant change in the Party. Our great leader Mao Zedong saved the Party and the Chinese revolution at the most critical moment.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, Mao Zedong correctly analyzed the political situation of the Anti-Japanese War and formulated the Party's political line during the war period. This line was to mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's power, and under the leadership of our Party, defeat the Japanese invaders, liberate the people nationwide, and build a new China. At the Political Bureau Meeting of the Party Central Committee held in Luochuan in August 1937, the principle of independence and self-reliance in the united front was proposed, and the strategic principle of independent and self-reliant guerrilla warfare (later also known as "basically guerrilla warfare, but not neglecting mobile warfare under favorable conditions") was decided. Guerrilla warfare was launched independently in the enemy rear, anti-Japanese base areas were established, and the people's anti-Japanese forces were developed and strengthened. At this historical turning point, Peng Dehuai once again jumped out to oppose Mao Zedong's correct line. He stood with Wang Ming, fiercely attacking the correct principles and lines formulated by the Party's Luochuan Conference, actively supporting and firmly adhering to the new capitulationist line represented by Wang Ming, that is, the second Wang Ming line. From the beginning of the war of resistance to 1943 when he left North China, Peng Dehuai, in his important leadership position as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Route Army and the Secretary of the Northern Bureau after 1941, caused trouble for Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, treating the areas he was in charge of as an independent kingdom, opposing Mao Zedong's correct line, and resisting the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong. He opposed the principle of independence and self-reliance in the anti-Japanese national united front, advocating the surrender of proletarian leadership and the implementation of class capitulationism. He opposed the strategic principle of basically guerrilla warfare, erroneously proposing the so-called "mobile guerrilla warfare" principle of operations, denying the strategic position of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. He opposed Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy," advocating and promoting the bourgeois political program of "liberty, equality, fraternity." He opposed mobilizing the masses, repeatedly pouring cold water on the mass movement in North China. He arbitrarily launched the "Hundred Regiments Offensive," supporting Chiang Kai-shek, helping the Kuomintang, and causing serious setbacks to the North China base areas and the development of our army. During this period, his personal ambitions grew bigger, and his face as a bourgeois conspirator became more and more apparent. He committed serious crimes in politics, military affairs, and organization, causing extremely heavy losses to the Party. Peng Dehuai was the most persistent and one of the main right-opportunist elements in our Party during the war of resistance.

He opposed the Party's line for socialist revolution and socialist construction, organized anti-Party cliques, and carried out plots to seize the military and the Party.

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of the socialist revolution in China. Peng Dehuai, this bourgeois opportunist and conspirator who infiltrated the Party during the democratic revolution, completely exposed his bourgeois reactionary nature of opposing the socialist revolution. In 1952, when Mao Zedong proposed the Party's transitional period general line and began socialist transformation, with the support of the biggest representative within the Party of those who take the capitalist road, he stubbornly opposed Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and vigorously opposed the socialist revolution. Peng Dehuai, in collusion with Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, intensified his anti-Party activities. They attempted to seize the highest power of the Party and the state through conspiracy, overturn the Party's transitional period general line, preserve capitalism, strangle socialism, and realize the bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration. It was later found that the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance was actually the Peng-Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance. The Party Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, firmly fought against them, exposing and crushing this anti-Party alliance, ensuring the great victory of socialist transformation.

In the spring of 1958, the Second Plenum of the Eighth Party Congress adopted Mao Zedong's general line of building socialism with great, daring, and pioneering spirit, and making it prosper, flourish, and catch up. The Party's general line is a major development of Marxism-Leninism by Mao Zedong. Under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line, the country saw a thriving scene of the Great Leap Forward, and a new social organization with strong vitality—the People's Commune—emerged in the countryside. The great victories of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune caused alarm and hostility among domestic and foreign reactionaries. To meet the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, Peng Dehuai eagerly jumped out, rallying a group of anti-Party elements. With the active encouragement of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique and the direct support of China's Khrushchev, he launched another more brazen attack on the Party during the Mount Lu Conference in 1959. They attempted to overthrow the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, realizing their heinous plot to seize the military and the Party.

On July 14, 1959, Peng Dehuai threw out a "Statement of Opinions" at the Mount Lu Conference. In this "Statement of Opinions," he used the despicable methods of distorting facts, spreading rumors, and cursing and abusing to deny the Great Leap Forward, deny the People's Commune, and deny the victory of the general line, directly pointing the spearhead at our great leader Mao Zedong. This was a thorough and complete anti-Party program.

The "Statement of Opinions" launched a vicious attack and slander on the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. He defamed the great march of building socialism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought by several hundred million people as "wind of exaggeration" and "not worth the loss." He defamed the People's Commune as "established too early" and "established badly." He defamed the revolutionary enthusiasm, revolutionary spirit, and mass movement of the Party and the people as "petit bourgeois enthusiasm," viciously attacking our great leader Mao Zedong. He shouted and screamed like this, intending to completely reverse the revolutionary mass movement, undermine the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and hinder the progress of the socialist revolution and construction, fully revealing his bourgeois "enthusiasm" against socialism.

Peng Dehuai, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, always hoped for our shortcomings and errors, always fearing that the world would not be in chaos. His consistent principle was that if the revolutionary situation was good, the work was smooth, he would be uncomfortable; as soon as there was a slight disturbance, as soon as there were shortcomings and difficulties, he would be happy and seize the opportunity to attack the Party. During the Mount Lu Conference, he gathered a small group of revolutionary revisionists, forming a revolutionary "military club" led by him. Their attack on the Party this time was completely purposeful, programmatic, prepared, planned, and organized. The target of their attack was directly aimed at our great leader Mao Zedong, attempting to change the Party's line, overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, and pull our country back onto the capitalist road. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee promptly exposed the Peng Dehuai anti-Party clique, removed their positions, and thoroughly crushed their counter-revolutionary coup plot, safeguarding the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, safeguarding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensuring the victory of our socialist construction.

With the support of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai had long been engaged in a series of activities to seize military power. He blocked information upwards and deceived those below, attempting to make the army break away from Chairman Mao's direct leadership. He also attempted to abolish the Military Commission of the Party Central Committee, secretly establishing another "Military Commission" to monopolize military power. To elevate his position, Peng Dehuai also engaged in the heinous activity of rewriting military history. He deliberately downplayed the great significance of the Autumn Harvest Uprising and exaggerated the role of the Pingjiang Uprising. He attempted to portray himself as a flag-bearer in the creation of the army through rewriting military history, deceiving and obtaining political capital.

As early as the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Peng Dehuai openly opposed including Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the Party in the Party Constitution. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev launched a counter-current against the so-called "cult of personality" of Stalin. Peng Dehuai followed Khrushchev, using his usual tricks of spreading rumors and slandering, defaming the sincere admiration of the entire Party and the people of the whole country for Chairman Mao as the so-called "cult of personality." He opposed shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" and singing "The East is Red," destroying Chairman Mao's extremely high prestige everywhere. This fully exposed his deep hatred for our greatest leader, his deep hatred for the Party and socialism, and fully exposed his ugly face as a counter-revolutionary revisionist.

He opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, promoting a bourgeois and revisionist military line, attempting to turn our army into a tool for the restoration of capitalism.

In the long-term revolutionary wars, Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively developed the military theory of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong's military thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism's military thought. This is the most powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialism and all class enemies.

For decades, Peng Dehuai has consistently adhered to his warlord thoughts, forming a complete bourgeois and revisionist military line after the founding of the nation, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army, the decisive factor in our army's invincibility, and the fundamental guarantee that our army will never change its nature. Peng Dehuai, in order to change the proletarian nature of our army and to seize military power, first directed his spearhead at the great Mao Zedong Thought. Peng Dehuai viciously attacked, saying, "Mao Zedong's military thought has become outdated, is no longer applicable, and cannot be used as a guide for operations and training." He strongly opposed the study of Chairman Mao's works, and in the training plans he formulated for the troops and schools, he did not regard the study of Chairman Mao's works as a basic principle and main content. In the draft of the "Regulations of the Military Commission of the Communist Party of China (Draft)" drawn up in 1953, it was originally stipulated: "The Party Committee shall take the thought that unifies Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution—Mao Zedong Thought—as the guiding principle for all its work." This clause is the core of the "Regulations," and Peng Dehuai deleted it all in his revision. This blatantly exposed his plot to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's absolute leadership of the army.

Peng Dehuai, under the guise of regularization and modernization, fiercely opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, denying the historical experience and fine traditions of our army, and promoting bourgeois regularization. He opposed proletarianization. He put military technology in the first place, denying that political and ideological work is the primary factor in our army's combat effectiveness. He absurdly claimed that "the quality of military training of the troops and the quality of military science learning of cadres at all levels are the basic standards for determining the high and low level of our army's future combat effectiveness." He attempted to abolish the Party's absolute leadership of the army, abolish the collective leadership system of the Party Committee, and promote the "one-man system," shouting that the "one-man system" is the "direction of our army building." He attempted to abolish political work in the army, abolish democratic institutions and the mass line, and destroy the principle of unity between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates. In 1953, the internal regulations, discipline regulations, and drill regulations approved and issued by Peng Dehuai were completely copies of foreign regulations. When he revised the internal regulations, he changed the political instructor of the battalion to "guided by the battalion commander" and deleted the sentence that the political instructor and the platoon leader are the direct superiors of all personnel in the platoon. After his revision, this regulation became a regulation for promoting the "one-man system."

Chairman Mao has always insisted on the policy of people's war, placing the victory of the revolutionary war on the basis of relying on the masses, arming the masses, and implementing the policy of universal military service. After the victory nationwide, to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and prevent imperialist aggression, the significance of people's war is not reduced but greatly increased. However, Peng Dehuai, under the pretext of changing circumstances, claimed that the militia system was outdated, attempting to abolish the universal militia system and fundamentally denying the policy of people's war. Peng Dehuai's erroneous views on militia construction are a continuation and development of his long-standing opposition to people's war and his refusal to rely on the masses, his warlordism, and his single-minded military viewpoint.

Peng Dehuai opposed Chairman Mao's strategic principle of active defense. He took a passive attitude towards preparing for the aggression of U.S. imperialism. He did not place his focus on preparing for war but adopted an opportunistic attitude of "it may not happen, it may not be fought," with no planning and leaving it to chance, advocating "fighting a messy battle." He opposed Chairman Mao's instructions on building a strong army, a strong air force, and a strong navy. He did not pay attention to the construction of the air force and navy, nor did he pay attention to the construction of various branches of the army. He opposed Chairman Mao's policy of relying on self-reliance to build an independent and complete modern national defense industrial system. He did not pay attention to the research and manufacture of conventional weapons, nor did he actively develop cutting-edge science and technology. He completely relied on the Khrushchev revisionist clique for the improvement of our army's equipment and the development of cutting-edge science and technology, attempting to make our army a subordinate of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, completely ignoring the needs of the proletarian revolutionary cause and the security of the motherland.

Peng Dehuai, in his military work, opposed using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, refused to execute Chairman Mao's series of instructions, fundamentally denied Chairman Mao's people's war thought, and attempted to lead our army onto the road of the bourgeois army, turning the proletarian revolutionary army into a tool for them to realize the restoration of capitalism. In 1959, after his anti-Party plot was completely exposed, at the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission chaired by Comrade Lin Biao, his crimes were exposed and criticized, and his bourgeois military line was thoroughly bankrupt.

Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, we are taught: "From the viewpoint of Marxism's state theory, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a strong army." In the socialist period, the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is extremely sharp and complex. This struggle will inevitably be reflected in the main tool of proletarian dictatorship, the army. The struggle between the two military lines is, in the final analysis, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for military power. This is an important component of the struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of the restoration of capitalism under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. "With the army, there is power." The army is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. The biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road must seize military power to seize state power. The struggle between the two military lines is a major event related to the destiny of our country and the future of the world revolution. We must not be complacent and take it lightly. China's Khrushchev has long stubbornly pursued a reactionary bourgeois line, attempting to implement and restore capitalism in China. Peng Dehuai's anti-Party activities and the bourgeois military line he promoted are part of the anti-Party activities of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev and are carried out under the direct plotting and sheltering of China's Khrushchev.

The struggle between our Party and the Peng Dehuai anti-Party clique is a struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. As Chairman Mao pointed out at the Mount Lu Conference: "The struggle that has emerged at Mount Lu is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two great antagonistic classes of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the past ten years of socialist revolution in China. In China, in our Party, this kind of struggle will have to continue for a while.... In short, the struggle will not stop until the class is completely annihilated."

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has finally exposed the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road, represented by China's Khrushchev. They have already fallen into the encirclement of hundreds of millions of revolutionary soldiers and civilians. At present, a nationwide movement to criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road is underway. The broad cadres and soldiers of our army should enthusiastically respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this revolutionary criticism, we should, together with the revolutionary people of the whole country, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line and the bourgeois military line, thoroughly eliminate their poison, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and ensure that our Party, our country, and our army will never change color.

    彻底清算彭德怀篡军反党的滔天罪行
    黎新功
    一九五九年八月，在庐山召开的党的八届八中全会，胜利地粉碎了以彭德怀为首的反党集团向党的猖狂进攻，粉碎了他们篡军篡党篡国，妄图实现资本主义复辟的大阴谋，保卫了党的社会主义建设总路线，铲除了隐藏在党内的一个大隐患。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这一胜利，沉重地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，对于巩固我国无产阶级专政，对于推动社会主义事业的深入发展，对于反对现代修正主义的斗争，具有深远的历史意义。
    庐山会议以后，彭德怀一直坚持反动的资产阶级立场，对党玩弄两面手法，表面上作了些“检讨”，实际上却怀着对党的刻骨仇恨，继续进行反党活动，伺机向党发动新的进攻。
    一九六二年，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起了新的反华浪潮，苏修在我国边疆地区进行颠覆活动，印度反动派在我国边境进行武装挑衅，美帝国主义唆使蒋介石匪帮阴谋窜犯大陆，中国的赫鲁晓夫与国内外的牛鬼蛇神遥相呼应，利用我国暂时困难，恶毒攻击三面红旗，鼓吹“三降一灭”，“三和一少”，“三自一包”，大刮单干风、翻案风，从政治、经济、思想文化战线全面地向党向社会主义进攻。彭德怀在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持和鼓励下，抛出了长达八万言的翻案书，紧密配合中国的赫鲁晓夫又一次向党发动了猖狂进攻。
    彭德怀从来不是马克思主义者，是混入党内的大阴谋家、大野心家、十足的伪君子，是老机会主义分子，是反革命修正主义分子，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在我军的代理人。彭德怀在我们党的历次重大的路线斗争中，都是站在错误路线方面，反对毛主席的正确路线的。我们必须彻底清算彭德怀反对我们伟大的领袖毛主席、反对伟大的毛泽东思想、反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的滔天罪行。
    民主革命时期，他一贯反对以毛主席为代表的正确路线，一贯反对伟大的毛泽东思想
    彭德怀混入我党我军以前，是一个有着极端狂妄的个人野心的旧军官。他在军阀军队混了整整十二年。他曾取名“彭得华”，字叫“石穿”，意思是用“水滴石穿”的精神来得到“中华”，称王称霸。彭德怀参加党，参加平江起义，是投革命之机，妄想利用革命来实现他“得华”的野心。这个野心家满脑子都是资产阶级思想、封建思想、修正主义思想，唯独没有一点马克思列宁主义。三十多年来，他的资产阶级世界观和资产阶级立场丝毫没有改变。在他的心目中，没有党，没有毛主席，没有群众，没有无产阶级，一切以他个人为中心，是一个极端的个人野心家。他一心所想的，就是要按照资产阶级的面貌改造党，改造军队。彭德怀从来就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。
    一九三○年六月，以李立三为代表的“左”倾错误路线，统治了党中央领导机关。他们反对毛主席创造农村根据地、以农村包围城市、以根据地推动全国革命高潮的正确路线，错误地订出了全国中心城市武装起义和集中全国红军进攻中心城市的冒险计划。彭德怀是这一军事冒险计划的坚决拥护者和积极执行者。他的不要根据地的思想，打大城市，打大仗的单纯军事观点，和立三路线是完全一致的。他企图依恃和利用立三路线来实现他扩大个人势力的野心，他是红军中坚决执行立三路线、反对毛主席正确路线的代表。
    立三路线被纠正以后，中央苏区红军在毛主席的正确领导下，接连粉碎了敌人的一、二、三次“围剿”，根据地发展了，红军壮大了。在全国也出现了反对日本帝国主义侵略的民族民主运动的新高潮。但是，在这个时候，党内形成了比立三路线更“左”的错误路线，这就是第一次王明路线。从一九三一年一月党的六届四中全会起，到一九三五年一月党中央在贵州遵义召开的扩大的政治局会议为止，这条错误路线在党内统治时间长达四年之久，使革命根据地和红军损失百分之九十，党的白区工作损失几乎百分之百。彭德怀是坚决执行第一次王明路线的。他极力反对和排挤毛主席的正确路线。第一次王明路线能够在中央苏区贯彻执行，彭德怀起了极其恶劣的作用。
    一九三五年一月，在贵州遵义召开的扩大的中央政治局会议，结束了第一次王明路线在党中央的统治，确立了毛主席在全党的领导地位。这是中国党内最有历史意义的转变。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在最危急的关头挽救了党，挽救了中国革命。
    一九三七年抗日战争爆发后，毛主席正确地分析了抗日战争的政治形势，制定了党在抗战时期的政治路线。这条路线就是放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我党的领导下，打败日本侵略者，解放全国人民，建立新中国。一九三七年八月党中央在洛川召开的政治局会议上，提出了在统一战线中坚持独立自主的原则，决定实行独立自主的山地游击战（以后又称为“基本的是游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战”）的战略方针，在敌后放手发动独立自主的游击战争，创建抗日根据地，发展壮大人民抗日力量。彭德怀在这个历史转变关头，又一次跳出来反对毛主席的正确路线。他和王明站在一起，大肆攻击党的洛川会议制定的正确的方针路线，积极拥护和坚决支持以王明为代表的新的投降主义路线，即第二次王明路线。彭德怀从抗战开始到一九四三年离开华北为止，他以十八集团军副总司令和一九四一年以后兼任北方局书记的重要领导地位，向毛主席、党中央闹独立，把他所主持的工作地区当成独立王国，反对毛主席的正确路线，对抗以毛主席为首的党中央领导。他反对党在抗日民族统一战线中独立自主的原则，主张放弃无产阶级领导权，实行阶级投降主义。他反对基本上是游击战的战略方针，错误地提出了所谓“运动游击战”的作战原则，否定抗日游击战争的战略地位。他反对毛主席的《新民主主义论》，宣扬和推行资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”的政治纲领。他反对放手发动群众，再三给华北地区群众运动泼冷水。他擅自发动“百团大战”，为蒋介石撑腰，帮了国民党的忙，使华北根据地和我军的发展遭受严重挫折。在这一时期内，他的个人野心越来越大，他的资产阶级阴谋家的面目暴露得越来越明显。他在政治上、军事上、组织上都犯有严重罪行，给党造成了极其重大的损失。彭德怀是抗战时期我们党内坚持右倾机会主义路线最久的，也是最主要的右倾机会主义分子之一。
    他反对党的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的总路线，组织反党集团，进行篡军篡党的阴谋活动
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着中国革命进入社会主义革命阶段。彭德怀这个在民主革命时期混入党内的资产阶级野心家、阴谋家，这时彻底地暴露了他反对社会主义革命的资产阶级反动本性。一九五二年，毛主席提出了党的过渡时期总路线，开始社会主义改造的时候，他在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，顽固地同毛主席的革命路线相对抗，竭力反对社会主义革命。彭德怀伙同高岗、饶漱石加紧进行反党活动。他们妄图用阴谋手段，夺取党和国家最高权力，从而反掉党的过渡时期总路线，保存资本主义，扼杀社会主义，实现资产阶级反革命复辟。事后查明，高饶反党联盟，实际上是彭、高、饶反党联盟。以毛主席为首的党中央同他们进行了坚决的斗争，揭露和粉碎了这个反党联盟，保证了社会主义改造的伟大胜利。
    一九五八年春，党的八大二次会议，通过了毛主席提出的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。党的这条总路线是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的重大发展。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国出现了蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进局面，同时在农村中出现了具有强大生命力的新的社会组织——人民公社。总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，引起了国内外反动派的惊慌和仇视。彭德怀为适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，迫不及待地跳了出来，纠合一些反党分子，在苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的积极鼓励下，在中国赫鲁晓夫的直接支持下，于一九五九年庐山会议期间，向党发动了又一次更为猖狂的进攻。妄图推翻党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，实现他们篡军篡党的罪恶阴谋。
    彭德怀一九五九年七月十四日，在庐山会议上抛出了一份《意见书》。他在《意见书》中用歪曲事实、造谣诽谤、诅咒谩骂等卑劣手法，否定大跃进，否定人民公社，否定总路线的胜利，把矛头直接指向我们伟大领袖毛主席。这是一个彻头彻尾的反党纲领。
    《意见书》对总路线、大跃进、人民公社大肆攻击污蔑。他把几亿人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，轰轰烈烈的建设社会主义的大进军，污蔑为“浮夸风”“得不偿失”。污蔑人民公社“办早了”，“办糟了”。污蔑党和人民群众的革命热情、革命干劲和群众运动是“小资产阶级的狂热性”，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他这样大叫大嚷，目的是企图完全反掉革命的群众运动，瓦解群众的革命干劲，阻碍社会主义革命和建设事业的前进，这就充分表现了他反对社会主义的资产阶级的“狂热性”。
    彭德怀站在反动的资产阶级立场上，总是希望我们有缺点错误，总是唯恐天下不乱。他一贯的原则是，如果革命形势大好，工作顺利，他就不舒服；一有风吹草动，一有缺点困难，他就高兴，就乘机而起，向党进攻。庐山会议期间，他搜罗一小撮反革命修正主义分子，结成以他为首的反革命“军事俱乐部”。他们这次向党进攻，完全是有目的，有纲领，有准备，有计划，有组织的。他们攻击的矛头，直接指向我们伟大领袖毛主席，妄图要改变党的路线，颠覆我国的无产阶级专政，把我国拉回到资本主义道路上去。毛主席和党中央及时地把彭德怀反党集团揪了出来，罢了他们的官，撤了他们的职，彻底粉碎了他们反革命政变阴谋，保卫了以毛主席为代表的党中央的正确领导，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保证了我国社会主义建设胜利进行。
    彭德怀在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的支持下，利用他窃取的职权，早就展开了一系列篡夺军权的活动。他对上封锁，对下蒙蔽，妄图使军队脱离毛主席的直接领导。他还企图取消党中央的军事委员会，背着中央，要另外成立一个“军事委员会”，由他来独揽军权。彭德怀为了抬高他的地位，还进行了篡改军史的罪恶活动。他竭力贬低秋收起义的伟大意义，极力夸大平江起义的作用。他企图通过篡改军史，把自己描绘成创建军队的一面旗帜，骗取政治资本。
    彭德怀早在党的第七次全国代表大会时，就公开反对把毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想列入党章。苏共二十大以后，赫鲁晓夫掀起了反对所谓斯大林的“个人迷信”的逆流。彭德怀紧跟赫鲁晓夫，采取惯用的造谣污蔑、捏造事实的卑鄙伎俩，把我们全党和全国人民对毛主席的由衷爱戴，污蔑为所谓“个人迷信”。他反对喊“毛主席万岁”，反对唱《东方红》，到处破坏毛主席无比崇高的威信。这就充分暴露了他对我们最伟大领袖的刻骨仇恨，对党和社会主义的刻骨仇恨，充分暴露了他的反革命修正主义的丑恶面目。
    他反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，推行资产阶级、修正主义的军事路线，妄图把我军变成复辟资本主义的工具
    在长期的革命战争中，毛主席天才地光辉地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的军事理论。毛泽东军事思想是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰。这是世界革命人民战胜帝国主义和一切阶级敌人的最强大的武器。
    几十年来，彭德怀一直坚持他的军阀主义思想，建国以后更形成了一条完整的资产阶级的、修正主义的军事路线，同毛主席的无产阶级军事路线相对抗。
    毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我军战无不胜的决定因素，是我军永不变质的根本保证。彭德怀为了改变我军的无产阶级性质，为了篡夺军权，首先把矛头指向伟大的毛泽东思想。彭德怀恶毒地攻击说：“毛泽东军事思想已经过时了，不适用了，不能作为指导作战、训练部队的指针。”他极力反对学习毛主席著作，在他制定的部队和学校的训练计划中，都不把学习毛主席著作作为基本方针和主要内容。一九五三年起草的《中国共产党军队委员会条例（草案）》原规定：“党委员会，以马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之统一的思想——毛泽东思想，作为自己一切工作的指针。”这一款是《条例》的核心，彭德怀在修改时全部加以删除。这就露骨地暴露了他反对毛泽东思想，反对党对军队的绝对领导的阴谋。
    彭德怀打着正规化、现代化的幌子，拚命地反对突出无产阶级政治，否定我军的历史经验和优良传统，专搞资产阶级的正规化，反对无产阶级革命化。他把军事技术放在第一位，否认政治思想工作是我军战斗力的首要因素。胡说什么“部队军事训练成绩的优劣，各级干部学习军事科学成绩的优劣，是决定我军今后战斗力高低的基本标准”。他企图取消党对军队的绝对领导，取消党委集体领导制度，推行“一长制”，叫嚷“一长制”是我军“建军的方向”。他企图取消军队的政治工作，取消民主制度和群众路线，破坏我军官兵一致、上下一致的原则。一九五三年，经过彭德怀审定颁发的内务条令、纪律条令和队列条令，完全是外国条令的翻版。他在修改内务条令时，把营的政治教导员改为“受营长指导”，把连队政治指导员和连长同为全连一切人员的直属首长一句删去。经过他的修改，这个条令便成为一个推行“一长制”的条令。
    毛主席一贯坚持人民战争的方针，把革命战争的胜利放在依靠群众、武装群众、实行全民皆兵的基础上。全国胜利以后，要巩固无产阶级专政，防止帝国主义的侵略，人民战争的意义不是降低了，而是大大提高了。但是，彭德怀借口形势变化了，民兵制度过时了，妄图取消普遍民兵制度，从根本上否定人民战争的方针。彭德怀在民兵建设上的错误主张，是他历来不要人民战争、不依靠人民群众的军阀主义和单纯军事观点的继续和发展。
    彭德怀反对毛主席制定的积极防御的战略方针。他对准备对付美帝国主义的侵略，完全采取消极的态度。他不把立足点放在准备打的上面，而是抱着“打不起来，可能不打”的机会主义态度，毫无规划，听之任之，主张“打烂仗”。他反对毛主席关于建设一支强大的陆军、强大的空军和强大的海军的指示，既不重视空军、海军的建设，也不重视陆军各兵种的建设。他反对毛主席提出的依靠自力更生、建设一个独立完整的现代化国防工业体系的方针，既不重视常规武器的研究制造，又不积极发展尖端科学技术。他把我军装备的改善和尖端科学技术的发展，完全依附于赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，妄图使我军成为赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的附庸。完全无视无产阶级革命事业的需要和祖国的安全。
    彭德怀在军事工作中反对以毛泽东思想为指针，拒不执行毛主席的一系列指示，从根本上否定毛主席的人民战争思想，妄图把我军引上资产阶级军队的道路，把无产阶级革命军队变成他们实现资本主义复辟的工具。一九五九年，他的反党阴谋完全败露以后，在林彪同志主持的军委扩大会议上，对他的罪行进行了揭露和批判，他的资产阶级军事路线也遭到了彻底破产。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反革命修正主义分子彭德怀批深批透批倒批臭
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”在社会主义时期，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线之间的你死我活的斗争，极其尖锐复杂。这个斗争，必然要在无产阶级专政的主要工具军队中反映出来。两条军事路线的斗争，归根到底，就是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺兵权的斗争。这是无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个重要组成部分。“有军则有权”。军队是无产阶级专政的柱石。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派要篡夺政权，就一定要篡夺军权。两条军事路线的斗争，是关系到我们国家的命运和世界革命前途的大事，我们切不可麻痹大意，掉以轻心。中国的赫鲁晓夫，长期以来顽固地推行一条资产阶级反动路线，妄图在中国实行和复辟资本主义。彭德怀的反党活动和他推行的资产阶级军事路线，是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的反党活动的一部分，是在中国赫鲁晓夫的直接策划和包庇下进行的。
    我们党同彭德怀反党集团的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。正如毛主席在庐山会议上所指出的：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，……总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，终于把以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了，他们已经陷入亿万革命军民的重重包围之中。当前全国正掀起一个对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动。我军广大指战员要热烈响应林副主席的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。在这场革命的大批判中，要同全国革命人民一道，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，彻底批判反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，大破资产阶级反动路线，大破资产阶级军事路线，彻底清除他们的流毒，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证我们的党、我们的国家、我们的军队永不变色。    　（《解放军报》供稿）
