Myanmar, renowned for its rice production, is experiencing an unprecedented severe rice shortage in its history. Villages are seeing people resort to eating grass roots and tree bark. The masses are tightening their belts day by day.

The mouthpiece of the Myanmar reactionary government, the *People's Daily*, recently openly called on the people to "eat one meal a day" and "prepare to go hungry."

How did the granary of Southeast Asia turn into a land of hunger? What is the reason?

Is it because Myanmar's geographical conditions are too poor? No.

Myanmar has fertile land, abundant rainfall, and a mild climate. Although Myanmar's agricultural technology is extremely backward, its rice production has always been self-sufficient, and it can export hundreds of millions of tons each year.

Then, is the rice shortage due to unfavorable weather? No.

In recent agricultural years, Myanmar has not experienced significant natural disasters. Nature cannot be blamed for Myanmar's rice shortage.

Myanmar's severe rice shortage is the result of the cruel oppression of the peasants by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, especially the reactionary policies of the Ne Win fascist clique, which are anti-communist and anti-people domestically, and rely on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism abroad.

Under the rule of the Ne Win reactionary government, Myanmar peasants are subjected to heavy exploitation. The exploitation by the landlord class, combined with the aggression of imperialism and the exploitation of Myanmar's commercial capital, has already made the lives of Myanmar peasants miserable. After the Ne Win clique, representing the landlord, bureaucrat, and comprador bourgeoisie, came to power, they further used the state machine to exploit the peasants under the pretext of "agricultural loans," "nationalization," "unified purchase and sale," and various oppressive taxes, further impoverishing the vast majority of Myanmar peasants. According to incomplete statistics, every year, 130,000 acres of land are transferred from peasants to landlords, usurers, and reactionary military personnel. Myanmar's vast rural areas are already on the brink of bankruptcy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants force the peasants to rise up repeatedly to resist the landlord class's rule."

The cruel economic exploitation and political oppression that the Ne Win reactionary government inflicts on Myanmar peasants have already forced the vast majority of Myanmar peasants to rebel. More and more Myanmar peasants are joining the people's revolutionary war under the leadership of the Myanmar Communist Party.

It can be asserted that under the wise leadership of the Myanmar Communist Party, the Myanmar peasants will surely, with the force of a thunderbolt, completely destroy the Ne Win reactionary regime!

    从缅甸粮荒看奈温集团的反动统治
    以盛产大米著称的缅甸，发生了缅甸历史上前所未有的严重粮荒。农村中出现了吃草根树皮的现象。广大人民正在一天一天地勒紧裤带。
    缅甸反动政府的喉舌《劳动人民日报》，最近公开要求人民“一天吃一餐”，“准备挨饿”。
    东南亚的粮仓缅甸，变成了饥饿之乡，这是什么原因呢？
    是缅甸的地理条件太差吗？不是。
    缅甸土地肥沃，雨量充沛，气候温和。尽管缅甸的农业技术极端落后，它的大米生产向来能够自给，每年还可以出口数百万吨。
    那末，粮荒的产生，是由于天时不正吗？也不是。
    最近几个农业年度，缅甸并不存在显著的自然灾害。大自然决不能对缅甸粮荒负责。
    缅甸严重粮荒，是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这三座大山残酷压迫农民的结果，特别是奈温法西斯集团对内反共反人民，对外投靠美帝、苏修的反动政策的结果。
    缅甸农民在奈温反动政权的统治下，遭受重重的盘剥。地主阶级的剥削，加上帝国主义的侵略和缅甸商业资本的榨取，本来已经使缅甸农民痛苦不堪。而地主官僚买办资产阶级的总代表奈温集团上台以后，更进一步利用国家机器，用所谓“农贷”、“国有化”、“统购统销”等种种名目，以及各种苛捐杂税，变本加厉地掠夺农民，使缅甸广大农民进一步赤贫化。据不完全的统计，缅甸农村中每年有十三万英亩的土地，从农民那里转到地主、高利贷者和反动军人手中。缅甸广大农村已经陷于破产。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”
    奈温反动政府对缅甸农民所进行的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，已经迫使缅甸广大农民起来造反。越来越多的缅甸农民参加了缅共领导下的人民革命战争。
    可以断言，缅甸农民在缅甸共产党的英明领导下，一定会以雷霆万钧之势，彻底摧毁奈温反动王朝！
