Two small reservoirs in Shandong Province, due to differing levels of flood preparedness, yielded two different outcomes when hit by heavy rain. There are valuable lessons to be learned from this experience.

This year's flood control work has been successful, achieving remarkable results. However, in some places, there are still some mental barriers in flood control work. For example, some cadres and the masses believe that there might not be a major flood this year, or they think that with years of water conservancy projects, even if a major flood comes, it won't be a problem. Some places do not fully recognize the significant political importance of flood control this year, so the allocation of forces is not sufficient. In some places, due to disagreements among the masses, they cannot work together effectively for flood control. If such complacency exists, it will inevitably affect the preparations for flood control and disaster relief.

Currently, for most regions across the country, it is the season of heavy rain and floods, which is the decisive stage of flood control. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production," overcome complacency, mobilize the masses, and actively engage in the battle against floods to achieve an overall victory in flood control work.

    麻痹不得
    山东两个小型塘坝水库，由于防汛准备不同，在暴雨袭击下，便出现了两种不同的后果。值得从中吸取有益的经验和教训。
    今年防汛工作的形势是很好的，取得了显著成绩。但是，有些地方在防汛工作中，还存在着一些思想障碍。如有些干部和群众认为，今年不一定来大水，或者认为连年兴修水利，大水来了不会出事。有的地方对今年防汛的重大政治意义认识不足，因此力量安排就不充分。有个别地方，有些群众组织由于意见分歧，不能很好的共同防汛。如果存在着这种麻痹思想，就必然影响防汛抢险的准备工作。
    当前，就全国广大地区来说，正处于暴雨洪水季节，是防汛的决战阶段。我们要坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，克服麻痹思想，发动广大群众，积极投入防汛的战斗，争取防汛工作的全面胜利。
