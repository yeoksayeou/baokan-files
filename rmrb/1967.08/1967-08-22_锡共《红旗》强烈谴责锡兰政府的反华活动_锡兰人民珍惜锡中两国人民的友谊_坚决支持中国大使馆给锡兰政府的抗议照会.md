	The Ceylon Communist Party's organ, the weekly "Red Flag," published an article on August 20 strongly condemning the Ceylon government's escalating anti-China activities.

	The article pointed out that the instigators behind these anti-China activities are, of course, the American imperialists' agents in Ceylon, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries.

	The article condemned the Ceylon government for openly allowing the Chiang bandits to participate in the so-called "Asian Girl Guides Training Conference" recently held here, which was supported and funded by the Ceylon government. The article stated that the Ceylon government allowed the Chiang bandits to "enter Ceylon under various pretexts to engage in anti-China activities and promote the plot of 'two Chinas,' which is a serious provocation against the People's Republic of China."

	The article said: The Ceylon Customs, under various pretexts, "confiscated all Chinese publications entering Ceylon, and even long-term subscribers of Chinese magazines such as 'Beijing Weekly' can no longer receive these magazines." However, any trash from the United States, Britain, West Germany, or India, or any pornographic magazines that corrupt our people, can enter Ceylon. The article pointed out that the Ceylon authorities "also allow any Soviet revisionist junk to enter Ceylon, but they do not allow the import of books and magazines from the People's China."

	The article continued, saying that recently, the Ceylon Customs detained a batch of Chairman Mao's badges sent to the Chinese Embassy in Ceylon, which is a serious political provocation against China by the Ceylon government.

	The article said: All reactionaries will only end up hurting themselves. All these anti-China heroes will only meet a miserable end. The article concluded by emphasizing that the Ceylon people cherish the friendship between the peoples of Ceylon and China, and they will protect this friendship as they would their own eyes.

	The New China News Agency, Colombo, August 21 reported that Ceylon friends strongly condemned the Ceylon government's instigation of thugs to publicly loot export goods and diplomatic items from a Chinese-chartered ship docked at the port of Colombo.

	Ceylon Freedom Party member Bandaranaike, on August 15, in the Ceylon House of Representatives, when discussing the looting of export goods and diplomatic items from the Chinese-chartered ship, pointed out that Chairman Mao's works, quotations, and portraits on the ship were all destroyed, which was a serious political provocation. He said that from this incident, "it is clear that certain groups are attempting to disrupt the existing relations between Ceylon and the People's Republic of China through such provocative actions. From this incident, it is clear that at least a small group of government officials are pursuing this policy." He said, "Over the past year and a half, this government has been pursuing a policy of gradually canceling the existing friendly relations between China and Ceylon."

	Ceylon citizen Abewardena wrote a letter expressing his resolute support for the position stated in the Chinese Embassy's protest note against the Ceylon government's instigation of thugs to loot items from the Chinese-chartered ship. He said, "All progressive people in Ceylon support your actions, and we support any further measures you may take regarding this."

	Ceylon citizen Premadasa sent a telegram to the Chinese Embassy saying, "I congratulate you on your firm stance in the matter of a small group of anti-China elements violating diplomatic immunity."

	A Ceylon doctor sent a telegram to the Chinese Embassy saying that in Ceylon, the anti-China elements are only a small group of despicable individuals, and the majority of the Ceylon people support you.

    锡共《红旗》强烈谴责锡兰政府的反华活动
    锡兰人民珍惜锡中两国人民的友谊
    坚决支持中国大使馆给锡兰政府的抗议照会
    新华社科伦坡二十一日电　锡兰共产党的机关刊物《红旗》周刊二十日发表文章，强烈谴责锡兰政府加剧进行反华活动。
    文章指出，这个反华活动背后的支持者，当然是美帝国主义在锡兰的代理人、苏联修正主义者和印度反动派。
    文章谴责锡兰政府公然让蒋匪帮参加最近在这里举行的、得到锡兰政府的支持和资助的所谓“亚洲女童子军教练会议”。文章说，锡兰政府让蒋匪帮“以各种借口进入锡兰参加反华活动和推行‘两个中国’的阴谋，是对中华人民共和国的严重挑衅”。
    文章说：锡兰海关以种种借口，“没收进入锡兰的全部中国书刊，甚至《北京周报》等中国杂志的长期订户现在也收不到这些杂志了”。然而，美国、英国、西德或印度的乌七八糟的任何东西、腐蚀我国人民的黄色杂志却可以进入锡兰。文章指出，锡兰当局“还允许任何来自苏联的修正主义破烂进入锡兰。但就是不准进口来自人民中国的书刊。”
    文章接着说，最近，锡兰海关扣留了寄给中国驻锡兰大使馆的伟大领袖毛主席的像章，这是锡兰政府对中国的严重政治挑衅。
    文章说：一切反动派只会搬起石头打自己的脚。所有这些反华的勇士们只会遭到悲惨的命运。文章最后强调，锡兰人民珍惜锡中两国人民的友谊，他们会象保护自己的眼珠一样来保护这种友谊。
    新华社科伦坡二十一日电　锡兰朋友强烈谴责锡兰政府唆使歹徒公开抢劫停泊在科伦坡港口的中国租船上的出口物资和外交用品的反华活动。
    锡兰自由党议员班达拉奈克十五日在锡兰众议院在谈到锡兰歹徒抢劫中国租船上的出口物资和外交用品时指出，船上的毛主席著作、语录和像片都被毁坏了，这是严重的政治挑衅。他说，从这个事件看来，“很清楚，某些集团企图通过这种挑衅行动来破坏锡兰和中华人民共和国的现有关系。从这个事件看来，已经很清楚，至少有一小批政府官员正奉行这种政策。”他说：“在过去一年半里，这个政府奉行的是逐步取消中国和锡兰之间现有的友好关系的政策。”
    锡兰公民阿贝瓦德纳在写信表示坚决支持中国大使馆在抗议锡兰政府唆使歹徒抢劫中国租船上物品的照会中所表明的立场。他说：“锡兰全体进步人士赞成你们的行动，我们支持你们可能对此采取的任何进一步措施。”
    锡兰公民普雷马达萨打电报给中国大使馆说：“我祝贺你们在一小撮反华分子破坏外交豁免权的事情上所采取的坚定立场。”
    一位锡兰医生打电报给中国大使馆说，在锡兰，反华的人只是一小撮卑鄙的家伙，大多数锡兰人民支持你们。
