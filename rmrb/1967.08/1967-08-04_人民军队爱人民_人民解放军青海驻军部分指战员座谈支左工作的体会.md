    The People's Army Loves the People
    — Some Officers and Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Qinghai Share Their Experiences in Supporting the Left

    Editor's Note: The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Qinghai have played a significant role in supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. They have demonstrated the fine tradition of the people's army loving the people.

    On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the army, they have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and the theories, lines, principles, and policies of the Cultural Revolution. They have summarized their experiences in loving the people and are determined to further improve their work in supporting the left, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Below are the speeches of several officers and soldiers at a symposium.

    Mao Zedong Thought is the Soul of Loving the People
    Deputy Chief of Staff of a Certain Unit, Yuan Guangzhi

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and his latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution, the more I studied, the more I felt close to it, the more I studied, the brighter my mind became.

    When the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ignited by Chairman Mao, burned across the Qinghai Plateau, the revolutionary organizations such as "August 18" in Qinghai Province were born. They firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee. These class enemies were terrified and hated the revolutionary actions of "August 18." They colluded with a handful of revisionists within the military and the ghosts and snakes in society to brutally suppress the revolutionary organizations such as "August 18." Obviously, at this time, to support the revolutionary factions of "August 18," one had to take great risks. However, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I thought that doing revolution could not just think of oneself, could not just consider personal safety; otherwise, it would not be about serving the people wholeheartedly. I resolutely stood with the revolutionary factions of "August 18" and firmly fought against the criminal activities of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee. For this, the revisionists within the military incited some uninformed masses to surround and fight me and my entire family. The counter-revolutionary persecution made me see more clearly who our enemies were, made me love the proletarian revolutionary factions more, and made me more firmly support the revolutionary factions of "August 18."

    Today, the revolutionary factions in Qinghai Province, with "August 18" as the main body, have achieved significant victories, but the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is far from over. I must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions in the revolutionary struggle, rely on the people, love the people, and create new merits for the people.

    Arm the Left with Mao Zedong Thought is Fundamental
    Manager of a Certain Unit, Yang Sizhao

    In our support work at the Sixth Motor Transport Depot, we have come to realize that arming the revolutionary factions with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting ideological revolutionization, is the fundamental task of supporting the left.

    Once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary factions can use Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to guide every aspect of the movement and solve every problem that arises. For example, on the issue of cadres, we helped the revolutionary faction of "August 18" at the Sixth Motor Transport Depot use Chairman Mao's five conditions for cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause and Vice Chairman Lin's three criteria for selecting and examining cadres to evaluate each cadre. The comrades of "August 18" distinguished between good and relatively good cadres, those who made general mistakes and those who made serious mistakes, and those who were capitalist-roaders within the party, and treated them differently.

    On the issue of dealing with the deceived masses, we and the revolutionary faction of "August 18" followed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and carried out "one helps one" heart-to-heart talks. We helped the deceived masses politically and ideologically to break completely with the bourgeois reactionary line and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    Because we and the revolutionary soldiers of "August 18" at the Sixth Motor Transport Depot analyzed, understood, handled, and solved various problems together with Mao Zedong Thought, we firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, grasped the policies and strategies, and thus educated the cadres and united the majority of the masses. Among the 32 middle-level and above leaders at the Sixth Motor Transport Depot, only one was isolated, 17 have already stood out in the struggle, and 3 are still holding important positions in the revolutionary committee. The deceived masses, after painstaking and meticulous political and ideological work, have mostly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    In several months of supporting the left, we deeply felt that: striving to infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the broad masses and turning it into a great force for changing the world and changing society, this is the greatest love for the people.

    For the People's Interests, Persist in What is Right and Correct What is Wrong
    Staff Officer of a Certain Unit, Yi Zuo

    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unprecedented in history, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings and errors in the work of "supporting the left." So, what should be done when there are shortcomings and errors? Should we be afraid and avoid contradictions, or should we be bold and believe in the masses, openly admit errors? In fact, this reflects two different worldviews in our minds.

    In February of this year, we went to a unit to do support work. Due to not fully understanding the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we mistakenly supported the conservative organizations and suppressed the revolutionary rebels in the sharp and complex class struggle. At this time, the comrades of the revolutionary rebels came to criticize us. At that time, some comrades did not want to admit their mistakes, fearing to make a self-criticism to the masses, affecting the honor of our army, making the masses not trust us. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind, had a debate, and realized that: the People's Liberation Army is a completely thorough army serving the people, it should persist in what is right for the people's interests, correct what is wrong for the people's interests, this is the fine tradition of our army. Today, if we supported the wrong side in supporting the left, we should bravely admit our mistakes and correct our mistakes, this is in line with the interests of the revolution. Everyone further realized that in "supporting the left," the attitude towards the masses' criticism is actually a question of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, errors are inevitable, we ask for fewer. Once an error is made, we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." We followed this teaching, went deep among the masses, listened to criticisms, actively checked ourselves, accepted lessons, carried forward achievements, overcame shortcomings, and clearly stated our firm support for the revolutionary faction of "August 18," and asked the revolutionary faction to give us feedback.

    By doing so, not only did it not damage the prestige of our army, but on the contrary, it was welcomed by the revolutionary faction, and they trusted us even more, coming to us with any opinions they had.

    Practice has made us realize that in the work of "supporting the left," only by accepting the broadest supervision of the revolutionary masses can we fully embody the fine tradition of our people's army. Only by influencing the masses with our actual actions, persisting in what is right and correcting what is wrong, will the revolutionary masses believe in and rely on us, the People's Liberation Army, more, help us overcome shortcomings, correct errors, carry forward achievements, and do a better job in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

    人民军队爱人民
    ——人民解放军青海驻军部分指战员座谈支左工作的体会
    编者按：人民解放军青海驻军指战员，在支援无产阶级革命派、支援工业、支援农业、军管、军训等工作中，起了很大作用，表现了人民军队爱人民的优良传统。
    他们在庆祝建军四十周年的时候，活学活用毛主席著作和文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，总结爱民的经验，决心进一步搞好支左工作，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。下面是几位指战员在座谈会上的发言。
    毛泽东思想是爱民的灵魂
    某部副参谋长　袁广智
    毛主席教导我们说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我反复地学习毛主席的这个教导和毛主席在文化大革命中的最新指示，越学越亲切，越学心里越亮堂。
    当毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，燃烧到青海高原的时候，青海省“八·一八”等革命组织诞生了。他们紧紧地掌握斗争大方向，把斗争的矛头指向青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这一小撮阶级敌人对“八·一八”的革命行动怕得要死，恨得要命。他们勾结军内一小撮修正主义分子和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，疯狂地镇压“八·一八”等革命组织。显然，这时要支持“八·一八”革命派，就要冒很大的风险。但是我学习了毛主席著作以后想到，干革命就不能只想到自己，不能只顾个人的安危；不然，就谈不上是全心全意地为人民服务。我毅然决然地和“八·一八”等革命派站在一起对青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的罪恶活动进行了坚决斗争。为此，军内修正主义分子煽动部分不明真相的群众，对我和我的全家进行了围斗。反革命迫害，使我更加看清了谁是我们的敌人，使我更加热爱无产阶级革命派，更加坚定地支持“八·一八”革命派。
    今天，青海省以“八·一八”为主体的革命派取得了重大的胜利，但是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还远没有结束。我要牢记毛主席的教导，在革命斗争中，紧紧地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，依靠人民，热爱人民，为人民立新功。
    用毛泽东思想武装左派是根本
    某部管理员　杨思昭
    我们在汽车六场支左工作中体会到，用毛泽东思想武装革命派，促进思想革命化，是支左工作的根本。
    用毛泽东思想武装了革命派，他们就能运用毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，去指导运动的每一项工作，去解决出现的每一个问题。例如在干部问题上，我们帮助汽车六场“八·一八”革命派用毛主席培养革命事业接班人的五个条件和林副主席选拔和考察干部的三条标准，来看待每一个干部。“八·一八”的同志把好的和比较好的、犯一般错误的和犯严重错误的干部，同党内走资本主义道路当权派严格区分开来，并且分别对待。
    在对待受蒙蔽群众的问题上，我们和“八·一八”革命派，遵循毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，开展了“一帮一”的谈心活动，从政治上、思想上帮助受蒙蔽的群众同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，站到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    由于我们和汽车六场的“八·一八”革命派战士一起，用毛泽东思想分析、认识、处理和解决各种问题，就牢牢掌握了斗争的大方向，掌握了政策和策略，因而教育了干部、团结了群众的大多数。汽车六场三十二名中层以上领导干部中，只孤立了一名，有十七名已经在斗争中站了出来，有三名还担任了革命委员会的重要职务。受蒙蔽的群众经过艰苦细致的政治思想工作，大都站到了毛主席的革命路线一边。
    在几个月的支左工作中，我们深深感到：努力把毛泽东思想灌输到广大群众中去，并变为改造世界、改造社会的巨大动力，这就是最大的爱民。
    为人民利益坚持好的改正错的
    某部参谋　易佐
    无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的，在“支左”工作中发生缺点和错误是难免的。那么，有了缺点和错误怎么办？是“怕”字当头，回避矛盾呢？还是敢字当头，相信群众，公开承认错误？实际上这是两种世界观在我们头脑中的反映。
    今年二月，我们到一个单位，进行支左工作，由于对伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动不够理解，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中错误地支持了保守组织，压制了革命造反派。这时，革命造反派的同志们，找上门来批评我们。当时，有些同志不愿意承认错误，怕公开向群众作检讨，影响我军的荣誉，使群众不信任我们。后来，我们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，进行了辩论，认识到：人民解放军是完全彻底为人民服务的军队，应该为人民利益坚持好的，为人民利益改正错的，这是我军的优良作风。今天支左支错了，就要勇敢地承认错误，改正错误，才符合革命的利益。大家还进一步认识到，在“支左”中，对待群众批评采取什么态度，实际上是对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是否忠诚的问题。毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我们遵照这个教导，深入群众，听取批评，主动检查，接受教训，发扬成绩，克服缺点，明确表示坚决支持“八·一八”革命派，并请求革命派给部队提意见。
    这样做的结果，不但丝毫没有损害我军的威信，相反的受到了革命派的欢迎，对我们更信任了，有什么意见都找我们谈。
    实践使我们认识到，在“支左”工作中只有接受革命群众最广泛的监督，才能充分体现出我们人民军队的优良传统。只有用自己的实际行动来影响群众，坚持正确的，改正错误的，革命群众才会更加相信和依靠我们人民解放军，帮助我们克服缺点，改正错误，发扬成绩，把“三支”“两军”工作搞得好上加好。
