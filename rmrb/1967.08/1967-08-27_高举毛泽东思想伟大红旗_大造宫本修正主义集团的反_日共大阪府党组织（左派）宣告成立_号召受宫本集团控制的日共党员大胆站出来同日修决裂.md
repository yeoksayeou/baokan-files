The Osaka Prefecture Party Organization (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party was established on August 6. This is another victory achieved by Japanese revolutionary communists in hoisting high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely opposing the revisionist group of Kobayashi within the Japanese Communist Party.

Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao were hung in the meeting hall. The conference listened to the report of the preparatory committee of the Osaka Prefecture Party Organization (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party and the report on the party's guiding principles, which were unanimously adopted after discussion.

Representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left) and the Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, as well as comrades Nishizawa Ryuji and Yasai Koji, attended the conference and delivered congratulatory speeches.

The conference finally adopted the declaration of the establishment of the Osaka Prefecture Party Organization (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party and elected the leadership of the party organization.

The declaration of the establishment of the Osaka Prefecture Party Organization (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that since the Japanese Communist Party was founded on July 15, 1922, it has consistently struggled to realize the revolutionary program. However, the leadership group of the Japanese Communist Party, centered around Kobayashi Akira, was influenced by the modern revisionist trend that emerged after the Sixth National Congress of the international communist movement. They became obsessed with parliamentary elections and the expansion of the party organization in a recruiting-like manner, gradually deviating from the party's revolutionary traditions, and finally falling into the quagmire of revisionism.

The declaration pointed out that the Kobayashi group, under the pretext of determining the transitional form of the revolution according to the attitude of the enemy, deceived honest and loyal comrades within the party and pushed the revisionist line within the party. This revisionist line is a replica of the Yoshisaka theory, aiming to "legally conduct the revolution." However, the facts of the past year have shown that the Kobayashi group has now openly abandoned the core and essence of Marxism-Leninism—the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The declaration said that the Soviet revisionist group is the culprit of splitting the international communist movement. They used weapons to aid India, Indonesia, and other reactionaries to oppose revolutionary peoples, becoming traitors to the revolutionary peoples. However, the Kobayashi group advocates for "unified action" with the Soviet revisionist group, attempting to cover up the true face of the Soviet revisionist group. The Soviet revisionist group, at its 22nd Congress, falsely claimed that the mission of the dictatorship of the proletariat had ended and announced the replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat with the "state of the whole people" and the "party of the whole people," thereby abandoning Lenin's path. The recent treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionist group in the Middle East incident shows that they have degenerated into genuine accomplices of U.S. imperialism. However, the Kobayashi group exonerates the Soviet revisionist group, falsely claiming that "the Soviet leadership has improved" and that "today's communist movement should adopt the attitude of unity in areas of agreement." Moreover, recently, the Kobayashi group has been frantically active, seeking to curry favor with the Soviet revisionist group through Hungary and Bulgaria.

The declaration exposed that the Kobayashi group, under the pretext of "independence and self-reliance," opposed the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and used dirty language to slander China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, committing violence against Chinese students, thereby abandoning the banner of proletarian internationalism.

The declaration emphasized that the Communist Party of China, as a genuine Marxist-Leninist party, under the leadership of the great comrade Mao Zedong, has upheld and developed the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Communist Party of China and comrade Mao Zedong have creatively solved various problems of the dictatorship of the proletariat after seizing power, establishing socialist China on an unchanging mass foundation, and resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world, thus becoming the center of the international communist movement and the bastion of the world people's liberation struggle.

The declaration emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the ideological and theoretical foundation for the unity of the leftists within the Japanese Communist Party. It said that Mao Zedong Thought defends and develops the core of Marxism-Leninism—the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve solid political, ideological, and organizational unity deeply rooted in the current situation of Japan.

The declaration called on party members of the Japanese Communist Party who are controlled by the Kobayashi group to boldly stand up and break with the revisionists politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and unite under the banner of the revolutionary left to fight. The declaration also expressed the intention to unite with the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left) and leftist organizations across the country to fight.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  大造宫本修正主义集团的反
    日共大阪府党组织（左派）宣告成立
    号召受宫本集团控制的日共党员大胆站出来同日修决裂
    新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：据《长周新闻》报道，日本共产党大阪府的党组织（左派）于八月六日召开了成立大会，这是日本革命的共产党人高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大造日共宫本修正主义集团的反所取得的又一个胜利。
    会场上悬挂马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东主席的像。大会听取了日本共产党大阪府的党组织（左派）筹备委员会代表作的筹备委员会的报告和建党方针的报告，经过讨论，全体一致通过了这两个报告。
    日共山口县委员会（左派）、日共兵库县委员会（左派）的代表和西泽隆二、安斋库治等同志都列席大会并在会上致贺词。
    大会最后通过了日本共产党大阪府党组织（左派）成立宣言并选举了党组织的领导人。
    日本共产党大阪府党组织（左派）的成立宣言指出，日本共产党从一九二二年七月十五日建党以来，一贯为实现革命的纲领而进行斗争。但是，以宫本显治为中心的日共领导集团，受到第六次全国代表会议后国际共产主义运动中出现的现代修正主义逆流的影响，热中于议会选举和拉伕式的扩大党组织，逐渐地远离了党的革命传统，终于跌进了修正主义的泥坑。
    宣言指出，宫本集团借口革命的过渡形式决定于敌人的态度来欺骗忠诚老实的同志，在党内推行修正主义路线，而这条修正主义路线就是野坂理论的翻版，就是要“合法地进行革命”。但是去年以来的许多事实说明，宫本集团现在已经公然抛弃了马克思列宁主义的核心和精华——无产阶级专政的思想。
    宣言说，苏联修正主义集团是分裂国际共产主义的罪魁祸首，他们用武器援助印度、印尼和其他反动派来反对革命人民，变成革命人民的叛徒。但是宫本集团却鼓吹同苏修集团搞“统一行动”，妄图掩盖苏修集团的真面目。苏修集团在它的第二十二次代表大会上妄说无产阶级专政的使命已经结束，并宣布由“全民国家”和“全民党”来取代无产阶级专政，终于抛弃了列宁的道路。苏修集团最近在中东事件中的叛卖行为说明他们已经堕落成为名副其实的美帝国主义的帮凶。但是宫本集团却为苏修集团开脱罪责，胡说什么“苏联领导变好了”，“在一致的方面实行团结是今天共产主义运动所应采取的态度”。不仅如此，最近宫本集团还拚命地进行活动，通过匈牙利和保加利亚，向苏修集团讨好。
    宣言揭露宫本集团借口“独立自主”，敌视马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，用肮脏的言词诽谤中国的无产阶级文化大革命，对中国学生滥施暴力，从而抛弃了无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。
    宣言强调指出，中国共产党作为一个真正的马克思列宁主义政党，在伟大的毛泽东同志的领导下，坚持并发展了无产阶级专政。中国共产党和毛泽东同志创造性地解决了取得政权以后无产阶级专政的各种问题，把社会主义中国建立在永不变质的群众基础之上，而且坚决支持越南人民和世界人民的革命斗争，从而成为国际共产主义运动的中心和世界人民解放斗争的堡垒。
    宣言强调，毛泽东思想是日共左派团结的思想基础和理论基础。并说，毛泽东思想保卫并发展了马克思列宁主义的核心——无产阶级专政的理论。我们将在毛泽东思想的指引下进行斗争，争取实现深深扎根于日本现状的巩固的政治上、思想上和组织上的统一。
    宣言号召受到宫本集团控制的日共党员大胆地站出来，从政治上、思想上和组织上同日修决裂，在革命左派的旗帜下联合起来进行斗争。宣言还表示要同日共山口县委员会（左派）以及全国的左派组织团结起来进行斗争。
