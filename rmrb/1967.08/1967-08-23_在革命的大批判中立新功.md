The revolutionary great criticism movement has reached a new high tide at Beijing Normal University. The warriors of Jinggangshan, who have emerged from the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will again display their prowess on the battlefield of great criticism.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University have deeply understood that to carry out the revolutionary great criticism, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, is the greatest political task and the greatest national affair at present. It is the overriding combat mission of the revolutionary masses. They have realized that the attitude towards this revolutionary great criticism is the attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, they have overcome various disturbances, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, launched a comprehensive attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, both politically, ideologically, and theoretically. They have also combined the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units.

Comrades of the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards! When the task of revolutionary great criticism is placed before us, every comrade should follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take up the pen as a sword, and throw themselves into the battle of revolutionary great criticism.

It must be seen that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution today is quite different from that of a year ago. At that time, it was necessary to carry out nationwide revolutionary linkage to bring the sparks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to every corner of the country, to fan the flames of revolution and ignite the fires of revolution. In the current situation, to carry out large-scale linkage is wrong. Now, what is needed is a deep revolutionary great criticism, to thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform within one's own unit. Some students are always looking outside, unable to stay in school, and only want to rush out. This phenomenon must be quickly changed. We should believe that the revolutionary masses in other places can educate themselves and liberate themselves. At the same time, we should regard doing a good job in the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and reform within our own units as the greatest support for the revolutionary masses in other regions.

To carry out the revolutionary great criticism, we must advocate "thinking more," "being good at using the thinking organ," "learning to analyze the method of things, and cultivating the habit of analysis." This requires us to seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must combine high revolutionary spirit with strict scientific attitude, use our brains, think about problems, and use the method of class analysis to conduct arduous investigations and research. In this way, we can better grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and policy of carrying out the revolution under the condition of proletarian dictatorship, grasp the vital points of the bourgeois headquarters, and give them a fatal blow.

The battle cry of the revolutionary great criticism calls on millions of revolutionary pioneers to join the new battle. Let us concentrate our targets, concentrate our efforts, and achieve new merits in the great decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines!

    在革命的大批判中立新功
    本报评论员
    革命的大批判运动，在北京师范大学掀起了一个新高潮。在无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中冲杀出来的井冈山战士，又将在大批判的战场上，大显身手。
    北京师范大学的广大革命师生，深刻地认识到，开展革命的大批判，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，是当前最大的政治，最大的国家大事，是无产阶级革命派压倒一切的战斗任务。他们认识到，对待这场革命大批判的态度，就是对待无产阶级文化大革命的态度，就是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度。因此，他们在人民解放军的帮助下，排除了种种干扰，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起了总攻击，并且把大批判和本单位的斗批改结合了起来。
    无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将们！当革命大批判的战斗任务摆在我们面前的时候，每个同志都应当紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，拿起笔作刀枪，投身到革命大批判的战斗中去。
    必须看到，今天无产阶级文化大革命的形势，已经和一年前大不相同了。那时候，需要进行全国的革命大串连，把无产阶级文化大革命的火种带到全国各地，煽革命之风，点革命之火。在当前的形势下，再搞大串连就是错误的了。现在需要进行深入的革命大批判，彻底揭露和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，搞好本单位的斗批改。有些同学眼睛净望着外地，在学校坐不住，只想往外冲。这种现象要迅速改变过来。我们应该相信外地的无产阶级革命派，能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己。同时，要把搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，作为对其他地区无产阶级革命派的最大的支持。
    进行革命的大批判，需要提倡“多思”，“善于使用思想器官”，“学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯”。这就要求我们认真地刻苦地学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示。我们必须把高度的革命精神同严格的科学态度结合起来，动脑筋，想问题，运用阶级分析的方法，进行艰苦的调查研究。这样，我们就能更好地掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，抓住资产阶级司令部的要害，给以致命的打击。
    革命大批判的战斗号角，号召千百万革命闯将投入新的战斗。让我们集中目标，集中全力，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，建立新的战功！
