Mao Zedong Thought has scored another great victory! We celebrate the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in the hearts of all ethnic peoples! We joyously shout on the Qinghai Plateau, singing the praises of your revolutionary line's great victory. We pledge to you: We will forever follow you in revolution, our hearts unchanging even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble!

The revolutionary workers of Qinghai First Machine Tool Factory have taken up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a great criticism. Here, revolutionary workers share their personal experiences, criticizing the reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is beneficial" and "class struggle is extinguished" propagated by China's Khrushchev.

During the "three supports, two militaries" work, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who have established deep combat friendships with the August 18th Revolutionary Faction of Qinghai, participated in the celebration rally. They loudly read from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," determined to, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The unity of soldiers and civilians is unbreakable; who in the world can match us? The August 18th Revolutionary Faction warriors of Dongfanghong Woodworking Factory in Qinghai Province present their beloved red armbands to the People's Liberation Army, determined to forever stand together with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and win together. They will carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," and criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

This year, the summer crops in Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai Province are thriving. Revolutionary peasants, filled with joy at the harvest, together with the supporting soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, harvest the golden and plump qingke. This is a victory of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The August 18th Revolutionary Faction of Qinghai Province Factory 135, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seized power from the capitalists within the factory after walking out. They resolutely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, using revolution to lead production, and production is flourishing.

    毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌
    ——庆祝青海省革命委员会诞生
    毛主席呀，毛主席！您是各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳！我们在青海高原上纵情欢呼青海省革命委员会的成立，放声歌唱您的革命路线又一伟大胜利。我们向您宣誓：永远跟着您闹革命，海枯石烂心不变！
    青海第一机床厂革命职工奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，掀起革命的大批判。这是革命工人以自己的亲身经历，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”的反动谬论。
    在“三支”、“两军”工作中，和青海“八·一八”无产阶级革命派建立了深厚战斗友谊的解放军广大指战员，参加了庆祝大会。他们高声朗读《毛主席语录》，决心在无产阶级文化大革命中，按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？青海省东方红木工厂“八·一八”无产阶级革命派战士，把心爱的红袖章献给解放军，决心永远和人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，批倒、批臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    今年青海省循化撒拉族自治县的夏收作物长势喜人。革命农民满怀丰收喜悦的心情，和支农的解放军一起收割金黄饱满的青稞。这是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
    青海省135厂“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从厂里走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权以后，坚决挑起了革命和生产两副重担，用革命统帅生产，生产蒸蒸日上。
