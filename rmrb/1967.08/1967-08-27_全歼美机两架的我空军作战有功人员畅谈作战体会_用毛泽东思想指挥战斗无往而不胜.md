	Air Force Personnel Who Destroyed Two U.S. Aircraft Share Their Battle Experiences
	Victory in Battle Guaranteed by Mao Zedong Thought

	They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further strengthen the revolutionization of people's minds, to heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, to strengthen their preparedness, and to achieve new victories and build new achievements in the struggle to defend our country's airspace and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	New China News Agency, Nanning, August 26 — To arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, to command battles with it, is to possess an invincible courage and an overwhelmingly powerful might. To be infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and to his proletarian revolutionary line is to be the most reliable pillar of the proletarian dictatorship.

	This is the deepest conviction of the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in Guangxi, who shot down two U.S. A-6 type aggressor aircraft and captured one American pilot in the airspace above a certain place in Guangxi. They shared this conviction during a mass battle review activity.

	Participants in this battle review included individuals and collectives who had distinguished themselves in the battle. When analyzing the reasons for their victory, the soldiers and officers pointed out that the boundless and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee of victory. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, earlier than everything, greater than everything, and more important than everything. They established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their souls and were always on high alert to guard our country's sacred airspace. Once the battle began, the commanders directed the fighting with quotations from Chairman Mao, and the soldiers encouraged each other with quotations from Chairman Mao. Many of the soldiers who distinguished themselves in the battle used their personal combat experiences to illustrate the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. These air force soldiers were participating in a battle for the first time. The aircraft that invaded our airspace were the latest attack planes of U.S. imperialism. However, because these air force soldiers were armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they had the determination to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy" and the heroic spirit to overcome all enemies. Therefore, they fought more bravely and finally shot down the enemy aircraft and captured an American pilot.

	The battle review activity also showed that the victory in this battle was the fruitful result of the broad masses of soldiers and officers resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote preparedness." The soldiers and officers participating in the battle pointed out that since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have linked the actual class struggle at home and abroad with the living thoughts of the troops, and have studied the struggle between the two lines thoroughly. They have always put revolution in the first place, seized the revolution to promote preparedness and work. When the billion revolutionary masses across the country rose up to launch a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev and his "self-cultivation"; when the materials exposing the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought conspiracies of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing were published, they angrily denounced the two big conspirators and big careerists' heinous crimes of usurping the Party and the military, and settled accounts with their bourgeois military line. The great criticism greatly raised the class consciousness of the soldiers and officers, and aroused their boundless love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In peacetime, they are always on high alert, fear no fatigue, and are always ready for battle, guarding their battle positions day and night. Once there is an enemy, they immediately join the battle. They said passionately, guarding the position to defend our country's airspace and standing guard for Chairman Mao is our most glorious task. We swear to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with our blood and lives.

	The soldiers and officers participating in this battle expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." In the battle review activity, the heroic air force soldiers pointed out that in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries fiercely criticized and fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, achieving immortal merits and setting an example for us to learn from. Although we are fighting on the front line to defend our country, our hearts are always with the proletarian revolutionaries. We regard every battle action we perform well as support for the proletarian revolutionaries. In the fierce battle to annihilate the enemy, when we think of this issue, we are full of energy and add boundless fighting strength.

	The heroic air force soldiers and officers also followed Chairman Mao's instructions to summarize experience, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, and be prepared for future battles. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction: "Modesty helps one go forward, conceit makes one lag behind," and used the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to examine themselves. They are determined to hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to further strengthen the revolutionization of people's minds, to heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, to strengthen their preparedness, and to achieve new victories and build new achievements in the struggle to defend our country's airspace and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    全歼美机两架的我空军作战有功人员畅谈作战体会
    用毛泽东思想指挥战斗无往而不胜
    他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把人的思想革命化加强再加强，百倍提高警惕性，加强战备，在保卫祖国领空、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，立新功，建新劳。
    新华社南宁二十六日电　用毛泽东思想武装头脑，指挥战斗，才能具有一往无前的勇敢和无敌于天下的强大威力。无限忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能最忠诚地保卫无产阶级革命派，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，做无产阶级专政的最可靠的支柱。
    这是在广西某地上空全歼美国A—6型强盗飞机两架、活捉美国飞贼一名的人民解放军空军某部指战员，在开展群众性的战评活动中的最深切的体会。
    参加这次战评活动的，有作战有功人员和有功集体。指战员们在分析取得这次战斗胜利的原因时指出，伟大的光焰无际的毛泽东思想是夺取胜利的根本保证。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，指战员们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，先于一切，大于一切，重于一切的位置，在灵魂中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，时刻百倍警惕地守卫着祖国的神圣领空。战斗打响后，指挥员自始至终用毛主席语录指挥作战，战斗员用毛主席语录互相鼓励。许多参战有功人员，在战评活动中，用亲身的战斗经历说明了毛泽东思想的无比威力。这些空军战士是第一次参加战斗。入侵我国领空的是美帝国主义最新式的攻击机。但是，由于这些空军战士是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的，有“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的决心和压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，因而愈战愈勇，终于揍下了敌机，并活捉了一名美国飞贼。
    战评活动还表明，这次战斗胜利的取得，是广大指战员坚决响应毛主席关于抓革命、促战备伟大号召的丰硕成果。参战部队的指战员指出，无产阶级文化大革命运动以来，他们联系国内外阶级斗争的实际和部队的活思想，狠抓两条路线斗争的学习，始终把革命放在首位，抓革命促战备、促工作。当全国亿万革命群众奋起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的时候，他们狠批猛批中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的《修养》；当揭露彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想阴谋活动的材料公开发表后，他们又愤怒声讨这两个大阴谋家、大野心家反党篡军的滔天罪行，清算他们的资产阶级军事路线。革命的大批判大大提高了指战员们的阶级觉悟，激发起指战员们对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱。他们决心按照林副主席的指示：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。平时，他们百倍警惕，不怕疲劳，随时作好战斗准备，日夜坚守战斗岗位。一有敌情，就立即投入战斗。他们满怀激情地说，坚守保卫祖国领空的岗位，为毛主席站好岗，是我们最光荣的任务。我们誓用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫以毛主席为首的党中央，保卫中央文革小组，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    参加这次战斗的指战员表示，坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召。在战评活动中，英雄的空军战士们纷纷指出，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派狠批猛斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，立下了不朽的功勋，是我们学习的榜样。我们虽然战斗在保卫祖国的岗位上，但是我们的心时刻都和无产阶级革命派在一起。我们把作好每个战斗动作都看成是对无产阶级革命派的支援。在歼敌激战中，我们一想到这个问题，就浑身是劲，增添了无穷的战斗力量。
    英雄的空军指战员们，还遵照毛主席关于总结经验，发扬成绩，克服缺点，以利再战的教导，遵照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准来检查自己。他们决心把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举，把人的思想革命化加强再加强，百倍提高自己的警惕性，加强战备，在保卫祖国领空、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，立新功，建新劳。
