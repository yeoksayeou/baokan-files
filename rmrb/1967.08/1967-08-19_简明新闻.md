Pseudo-Soldiers in South Vietnam Surrender to the People

Pseudo-soldiers in South Vietnam, under the heavy blows of the liberation armed forces, have seen their morale decline day by day, with growing anti-war sentiments, and are surrendering to the people in droves.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the first six months of this year, 830 pseudo-soldiers in Gia Lai Province surrendered to the people with their weapons.

Argentine Dictatorship Enacts Reactionary Law

The pro-American dictatorship of Onganía in Argentina recently enacted a "anti-communist law" under the direction of the United States. This new fascist measure is entirely aimed at suppressing the broad masses of the Argentine people who oppose the betrayal of national interests to American imperialism, political oppression, and economic exploitation.

According to this "anti-communist law," the authorities have established a "National Intelligence Center" in the style of the infamous American spy agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, specifically to investigate individuals engaged in patriotic democratic activities, in order to carry out political persecution.
