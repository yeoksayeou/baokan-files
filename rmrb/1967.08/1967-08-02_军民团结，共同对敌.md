Under the close care of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and with the strong support of the military and people across the nation, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and the soldiers stationed there have united as one, fighting bravely and growing stronger with each battle. The deceived masses have awakened and turned against the enemy. A small clique of those in power within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road, along with a few bad leaders within the "Million Heroes," have been exposed and are now in a situation where everyone is against them. The situation of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is getting better and better.

In the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan have made immortal contributions by defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They have greatly promoted the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and across the nation.

Fire tests gold. The revolutionary masses of Wuhan are heroes who have fought their way through the white terror of the bourgeoisie and have been tempered in the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution. They are steadfast in their loyalty to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They fear no attacks, no pressure, and always maintain a thorough revolutionary spirit of rebellion. They are excellent examples for our soldiers to learn from. The soldiers stationed in Wuhan have supported them and, in fighting side by side, have learned a lot and been tempered and improved.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the Party and the military in Wuhan, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals of restoring capitalism, have used various despicable means to deceive cadres and soldiers. They spread rumors, distorted facts, and slandered and defamed the revolutionary masses. As a result, some soldiers were temporarily confused and unable to distinguish between friends and enemies. The misunderstandings and estrangement between some officers and soldiers in the Wuhan garrison and the revolutionary masses were entirely caused by this small clique of bad elements. The soldiers who were temporarily deceived are not to blame; they are Chairman Mao's good soldiers. We believe they will definitely make new contributions to the people in future struggles.

The soldiers of the Wuhan garrison have, in recent days, used various methods to extensively interact with the revolutionary youths and actively launched activities to learn from the revolutionary masses. This activity is very necessary and very timely, excellent! Through learning, the Wuhan garrison and the revolutionary masses have increased their mutual understanding, deepened their class feelings, and strengthened the relationship between the military and the people. The conspiracy of a small clique within the Party and the military to create opposition between the military and the people has been quickly exposed. A high tide of supporting the military and loving the people, uniting to fight the enemy, is forming. The soldiers love the revolutionary masses even more and more firmly support the revolutionary masses; the revolutionary masses also love and support the People's Liberation Army even more. The Wuhan garrison and the revolutionary masses have said well: "Clearly and unmistakably supporting the revolutionary masses is the greatest love for the people," "Fighting side by side with the People's Liberation Army to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end is the greatest support for the military."

Our army is the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. "Standing firmly with the Chinese people and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people is the sole purpose of this army." We are confident that the soldiers of the Wuhan garrison will forever unite with the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary people, fight together, be of one heart, stand shoulder to shoulder, share the same breath, and share the same fate. They will firmly advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to victory and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

When the military and the people unite as one, who in the world can stand against us?

    军民团结，共同对敌
    在毛主席、林副主席和中央文革小组的亲切关怀下，在全国军民的大力支持下，武汉地区无产阶级革命派和驻军广大指战员团结一致，愈战愈勇；受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒，反戈回击；党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，已处于老鼠过街、人人喊打的境地。武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的形势，越来越好。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，武汉无产阶级革命派为保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，立下了不朽的功勋，为促进武汉地区和全国的无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大贡献。
    烈火炼真金。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，是从资产阶级白色恐怖中冲杀出来的闯将，是无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火冶炼出来的真金。他们无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚定立场，他们不怕围攻，不怕高压，始终坚持斗争的彻底的革命造反精神，是我军指战员学习的好榜样。武汉驻军的广大指战员支持了他们，在同他们并肩战斗中，学到了很多东西，得到了锻炼和提高。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区党内、军内的代理人，为了达到他们反革命复辟的罪恶目的，采用种种卑鄙手段，蒙蔽干部和战士。他们制造谣言，颠倒黑白，污蔑和中伤无产阶级革命派。致使某些指战员一时不明真相，不辨敌友。武汉驻军中某些干部战士和无产阶级革命派之间一度存在的误解和隔阂，完全是这一小撮坏蛋造成的。一时受蒙蔽的指战员是没有责任的，他们是毛主席的好战士。我们相信他们一定能够在今后的斗争中为人民立新功。
    武汉驻军广大指战员，连日以来，采用多种方式，同革命小将广泛接触，积极开展向无产阶级革命派学习的活动。这个活动，非常必要，非常适时，好得很！经过学习，武汉驻军同无产阶级革命派，增进了相互了解，加深了阶级感情，密切了军民关系。党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派制造军民对立的阴谋，被迅速揭穿。一个拥军爱民、团结对敌的高潮，正在形成。广大指战员更加热爱无产阶级革命派，更坚定地支持无产阶级革命派；广大革命群众也更加热爱解放军，拥护解放军。武汉驻军和无产阶级革命派说得好：“旗帜鲜明地、毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派，是最大的爱民”，“紧紧地同解放军并肩战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，是最大的拥军。”
    我军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队。“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们深信，武汉驻军广大指战员一定会同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，心连心，肩并肩，同呼吸，共命运，坚定不移地沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？
