The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on July 30, strongly protesting the continued brutal suppression by the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong and Kowloon against workers and patriotic compatriots. The statement issued a stern warning to British imperialism: the seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We will not tolerate British imperialism committing crimes on the soil of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and we will not allow our class brothers and patriotic compatriots to be persecuted and slaughtered. The day to settle accounts with British imperialism for its heinous crimes committed over more than a hundred years in Hong Kong and Kowloon has arrived. Blood debts must be repaid in blood.

The statement said, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government and severe condemnation from the Chinese people and world opinion, the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong have intensified their brutal suppression of workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Since mid-July, they have brazenly dispatched large numbers of military police and "anti-riot squads" to launch large-scale armed attacks, savage destruction, and mass arrests on patriotic trade unions, workers' clubs, workers' children's schools, and workers' dormitories in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They have killed seven workers and patriotic compatriots, including He Feng, secretary of the Kowloon Dockyard Workers' Union, injured more than forty people, and arrested more than a thousand. This is another heinous crime committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong and Kowloon, a serious political provocation against the great Chinese people. The Chinese working class expresses great indignation and strongly protests against this.

The statement pointed out that British imperialism is directing its main repression against workers and patriotic trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon because the workers' strike struggles there have dealt a heavy blow to British imperialism. The heroic workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon are part of the great Chinese working class. They have carried on the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Hong Kong workers' strike of the past and bravely stood at the forefront of the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle, playing a key role. They fear no violence, are not afraid of sacrifice, and are not tempted by gains. Following the joint strike of sixty thousand workers on June 10 and June 24, they launched a large-scale strike by seafarers to boycott the transportation of goods in and out of Hong Kong. The strike by workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon is excellent! It has shaken the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong, demonstrated the great fearlessness of the Chinese nation, and added a new chapter to the glorious history of the Chinese working class's anti-imperialist struggle. The heroic workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon are truly good sons of the motherland and good workers loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The workers of the whole country and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions express their warmest greetings and highest combat respect to the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon who are fighting bravely.

The statement said, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "From the long-term point of view, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." Today, British imperialism's brutal suppression in Hong Kong and Kowloon does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness, a sign of its reactionary rule reaching its end. It fully exposes its panic in the face of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the heroic struggle of workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. No matter how brutally British imperialism suppresses or deceives and tempts, it will never extinguish the blazing fire of the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. On the contrary, it will only arouse them to fight even more bravely, giving British imperialism tenfold, hundredfold punishment and blows.

The statement emphasized that we solemnly demand: the British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately stop their fascist atrocities of killing and arresting workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and must immediately implement the various demands of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Otherwise, the Chinese working class will, together with the workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, take all effective measures to smash the reactionary British fascist rule to pieces.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on July 30 to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, to be forwarded to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Committee for Opposing British Oppression, warmly applauding the workers and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon for their victories in striking back against British imperialism under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and expressing their warmest greetings. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also remitted another HK$1 million to support the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British and anti-fascist strike struggle.

The telegram enthusiastically praised the revolutionary spirit and heroic demeanor of the workers and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British and anti-fascist struggle. The telegram said, you have struck well, striking out the revolutionary spirit of the working class, striking out the unyielding spirit of the Chinese nation, greatly boosting the morale of revolutionary people around the world, and greatly crushing the arrogance of imperialism.

The telegram said, because the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon are playing a key role in the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle, recently the British fascist beasts have crazily pounced on patriotic trade unions and striking workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, brazenly dispatching large numbers of military police to launch armed suppression against our patriotic trade unions, brutally slaughtering trade union cadres and workers, in a vain attempt to suppress the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. This is utterly impossible. Workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be frightened or crushed, but will certainly be able to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The telegram said, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary force." British imperialism's brutal suppression and bloody slaughter indicate that the great strike and heroic struggle of workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon have hit the vital spot of British imperialism, indicating the desperate end of British imperialism's reactionary rule in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The telegram said, we hope you will continue to hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's wise teachings on "the ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses," mobilize more broadly and deeply, form a surging people's anti-British and anti-fascist army, meet force with force, press on, and continuously give British imperialism powerful blows. If the enemy does not surrender, we will annihilate it!

The telegram finally expressed that the workers of the whole country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will be your strong backing. The telegram announced the remittance of another HK$1 million to support the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon in their strike struggle.

    中华全国总工会发表声明强烈抗议英帝法西斯暴行
    绝不许英帝在我港九土地上为非作歹
    全总再次汇去港币一千万元支援港九同胞反英抗暴斗争
    新华社讯　中华全国总工会于七月三十日发表声明，强烈抗议港英法西斯当局继续疯狂地残酷镇压港九工人和爱国同胞的滔天罪行，严重警告英帝国主义：七亿中国人民是不好惹的，我们决不能容忍英帝国主义在中国的港九土地上为非作歹，决不能听任自己的阶级兄弟和爱国同胞惨遭迫害和屠杀。现在，彻底清算英帝国主义一百多年来在港九犯下的滔天罪行的日子已经来到了，血债一定要用血来还。
    声明说，港英法西斯当局不顾中国政府的一再警告和中国人民、世界舆论的严厉谴责，继续变本加厉地残酷镇压港九工人和爱国同胞。七月中旬以来，竟悍然出动大批军警和“防暴队”，连续对我港九爱国工会、工人俱乐部、工人子弟学校和工人宿舍等进行大规模的武装袭击、野蛮摧残和大肆逮捕，先后打死九龙船坞劳工联合会书记何枫等七名工人和爱国同胞，打伤四十多人，逮捕一千多人。这是英帝国主义在港九犯下的又一滔天罪行，是对伟大的中国人民的严重政治挑衅。中国工人阶级对此表示极大的愤怒，并提出最最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，英帝国主义所以这样疯狂地把迫害的主要矛头对准港九工人和爱国工会，是由于港九工人的罢工斗争沉重地打击了英帝国主义。英勇的港九工人是伟大中国工人阶级的一部分。他们发扬了当年香港工人大罢工的光荣革命传统，英勇地站在反英抗暴斗争的最前列，发挥了主力军的作用。他们不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，不为利诱，继六月十日、六月二十四日六万工人联合大罢工之后，又掀起了海员工人抵制运输货物进出香港的大罢工。港九工人的大罢工好得很！好得很！它震撼着英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。显示了中华民族大无畏的英雄气概，为中国工人阶级反帝斗争的光辉史诗增添了新的篇章。英勇的港九工人不愧是祖国的好儿女，不愧是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的好工人。全国工人和中华全国总工会向正在英勇战斗的港九工人兄弟，表示最亲切的慰问和最崇高的战斗敬礼。
    声明说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎”。“从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”今天，英帝国主义在港九的残酷镇压，绝不表明它的强大，恰恰是它虚弱的表现，是它反动统治穷途末路的表现，充分暴露了它在中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和港九工人、爱国同胞英勇斗争面前的惊慌万状。不管英帝国主义疯狂镇压也好，还是欺骗利诱也好，都绝不能扑灭港九工人和爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的熊熊烈火。相反，只能激起港九工人和爱国同胞更加英勇的斗争，给予英帝国主义以十倍、百倍的惩罚和打击。
    声明强调说，我们严正要求：港英当局必须立即停止枪杀和逮捕港九工人和爱国同胞的法西斯暴行，必须立即实现中国外交部和港九爱国同胞的各项要求。否则，中国工人阶级定将和港九工人兄弟和爱国同胞一起，采取一切有效办法把反动的港英法西斯统治砸个稀巴烂。
    新华社讯　中华全国总工会于七月三十日打电报给港九工会联合会转港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会，热烈欢呼港九工人兄弟和爱国同胞，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗狠揍英帝国主义所取得的每一个胜利，并向他们致以最亲切的慰问。中华全国总工会还随电再次汇去港币一千万元，支援港九工人兄弟反英抗暴的罢工斗争。
    电报热烈赞扬港九工人兄弟和爱国同胞在反英抗暴斗争中，狠揍港英帝国主义的革命精神和英雄气概。电报说，你们打得好，打出工人阶级的革命精神，打出中华民族不可侮的风格，大长世界革命人民的志气，大灭帝国主义的威风。
    电报说，正因为港九工人在反英抗暴斗争中起着主力军的作用，最近以来，港英法西斯野兽疯狂地扑向港九爱国工会和罢工工人，悍然出动大批军警连续武装镇压我爱国工会，血腥屠杀工会干部和工人，妄图把港九工人和爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争压下去。这是一万个办不到的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九工人和爱国同胞是吓不倒、压不垮的，相反，却一定能够砸烂英帝国主义在港九的反动统治。
    电报说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。英帝国主义这种残暴镇压和血腥屠杀，正表明港九工人的大罢工和英勇斗争，击中了英帝国主义的要害，表明了英帝国主义在港九的反动统治的穷途末路。
    电报说，希望你们继续高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛主席关于“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”的英明教导，展开更广泛更深入的动员，组成浩浩荡荡的人民反英抗暴大军，针锋相对，再接再厉，不断地给英帝国主义以有力的打击。敌人不投降，就叫它灭亡！
    电报最后表示，用毛泽东思想武装起来的经过无产阶级文化大革命烈火锻炼的全国工人，誓作你们的坚强后盾。
    电报最后宣布再次汇去港币一千万元，支援港九工人兄弟的罢工斗争。
