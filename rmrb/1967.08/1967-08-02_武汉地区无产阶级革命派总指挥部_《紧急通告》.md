The Central Committee's letter is an important directive for the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, serving as a guide for the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in Wuhan. The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan enthusiastically support these directives. To implement the Central Committee's directives, the proletarian revolutionaries across the city will immediately launch a wave of intense criticism and struggle against the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." We will actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," setting an example in both areas. We will also actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," setting an example in this regard as well. We must have the courage and determination to liberate the deceived masses, welcoming them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For those bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who have committed serious crimes, if they mend their ways, we will also provide them with a way out.

New China News Agency, Wuhan, August 1st: The Revolutionary Headquarters of the Proletarian Revolutionaries in Wuhan issued an "Emergency Announcement" on July 31st, calling on the proletarian revolutionaries across the city to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to launch a new high tide in the Cultural Revolution, to launch a new high tide in grasping revolution and promoting production, and to achieve even greater victories in the Cultural Revolution. The announcement states:

At this crucial moment when the proletariat is seizing power and the bourgeoisie is attempting to seize it back, when the two classes, two lines, and two roads are in a decisive battle, the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Wuhan—the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military—manipulate the "Million Heroes" and the handful of bad leaders within the "public security, procuratorate, and courts" who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. They have launched a ferocious counterattack against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. We proletarian revolutionaries, in order to thoroughly smash the evil plots of the handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and the military in Wuhan, to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have fought a resolute battle against the handful of bourgeois representatives within the Party and the military. Finally, under the close care of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, as well as the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and with the full support of the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionaries across the country, the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan have defeated the arrogant attacks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan.

The Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued a letter to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in Wuhan on July 27th. This is a great support and close care for the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in Wuhan, especially for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. It is a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan. This letter is an important directive for the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and a guide for the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in Wuhan. We proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan enthusiastically support these directives and will study them seriously, propagate them widely, and implement them resolutely.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and should not seek fame like the Emperor Xiang Yu." To implement the directives in the letter from the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in Wuhan, to launch a new high tide in the Cultural Revolution, to launch a new high tide in grasping revolution and promoting production, and to achieve even greater victories in the Cultural Revolution, we issue the following emergency announcement:

1. The proletarian revolutionaries across the city will immediately launch a wave of intense criticism and struggle against the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents within the Party and the military in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. We will fight them down politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

2. The proletarian revolutionaries across the city must actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," bravely shouldering the double burden of revolution and production, setting an example in both areas. The proletarian revolutionaries must set an example in "frugal revolution."

3. We proletarian revolutionaries love the People's Liberation Army the most. We must actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," setting an example in this regard. We must work together with the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and see it through to the end.

4. The proletarian revolutionaries across the city must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching that the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. We must have the courage and determination to liberate the deceived masses. The deceived masses are our class brothers. We must not adopt an attitude of ridicule, insult, retaliation, or arrest towards them. We must use Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as a weapon to do patient, in-depth, and detailed ideological work with them, winning them over, educating them, and uniting them. We must warmly welcome them to rise up in rebellion and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On the basis of achieving great unity among the proletarian revolutionaries, we will gradually achieve unity with the ninety-five percent, directing our hatred and struggle against the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents within the Party and the military in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line.

5. We proletarian revolutionaries have always strictly distinguished between the deceived masses within the "Million Heroes" and the handful of bad leaders who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. Being deceived is not a crime, turning against the enemy is a merit. We warmly welcome the deceived masses within the "Million Heroes" to quickly awaken and rise up against the handful of bourgeois representatives within the Party and the military in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and working together with the revolutionary rebel workers to grasp revolution and promote production.

6. For those bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who have committed serious crimes, if they no longer work for the bourgeois representatives within the Party and the military in Wuhan and mend their ways, we will also provide them with a way out. If they continue to oppose the people and sabotage the efforts to grasp revolution and promote production, we will give them a severe blow and actively assist the relevant departments in punishing them according to law.

    武汉地区无产阶级革命派总指挥部
    《紧急通告》
    中央的信是对武汉地区文化大革命的重要指示，是武汉地区革命群众和广大指战员的行动指南。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，最热烈拥护这些指示。为了执行中央指示，全市无产阶级革命派立即掀起一个对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其武汉的代理人和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的大批判大斗争高潮；积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，作抓革命促生产的模范；积极响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，作拥军爱民的模范；要有胆略、有气魄解放受蒙蔽的群众，欢迎他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来；对犯有严重罪行的“百万雄师”中的坏头头，只要他们改邪归正，同样给予出路。
    新华社武汉一日电　武汉地区无产阶级革命派总指挥部，七月三十一日发出《紧急通告》，号召全市无产阶级革命派更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更加伟大的新胜利。《通告》说：
    正当无产阶级夺权和资产阶级反夺权，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉的代理人——党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，操纵“百万雄师”和“公检法”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，对毛主席的革命路线，对武汉地区无产阶级革命派发动了猖狂反扑。我们无产阶级革命派为了彻底粉碎混进武汉地区党内、军内一小撮资产阶级代表人物的罪恶阴谋，为了保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线，赤胆忠心，和党内军内一小撮资产阶级代表人物进行了针锋相对的斗争。终于在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席及中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组的亲切关怀下，在中国人民解放军和全国无产阶级革命派的全力支持下，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派打败了武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派狂妄的进攻。
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组，于七月二十七日发出了给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信。这是对我们武汉地区革命群众和广大指战员、特别是对武汉地区无产阶级革命派的巨大支持和亲切关怀，是对武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的一个沉重打击。这封信，是对武汉地区文化大革命的重要指示，是我们武汉地区革命群众和广大指战员的行动指南。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，对于这些指示最热烈的拥护，一定要认真学习、大力宣传，坚决执行。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”为了执行中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组给武汉市革命群众和广大指战员的一封信中的指示，为了掀起无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，掀起狠抓革命、猛促生产的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更加伟大的新胜利，特发出紧急通告如下：
    一、全市无产阶级革命派立即掀起一个对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区党内军内的代理人和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头的大批判、大斗争的高潮，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    二、全市无产阶级革命派要积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把革命和生产两副重担勇敢地挑起来，作抓革命促生产的模范。无产阶级革命派要作“节约闹革命”的模范。
    三、我们无产阶级革命派最爱解放军，我们要积极响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，作拥军爱民的模范，要和人民解放军广大指战员一起，共同担负起武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的重担，一定把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    四、全市无产阶级革命派要牢记毛主席关于无产阶级“只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的伟大教导。要有胆略、有气魄解放受蒙蔽的群众。受蒙蔽的一般群众，是我们的阶级兄弟，对他们决不能采取讽刺谩骂、打击报复的态度，更不能抓人，要以毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》为武器，对他们进行耐心、深入、细致的思想工作，争取、教育、团结他们，热情地欢迎他们起来造反，欢迎他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，在实现无产阶级革命派大联合的基础上，逐步达到团结两个百分之九十五。把仇恨和斗争矛头狠狠集中对准党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区党内军内的代理人和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头。
    五、我们无产阶级革命派从来都是把“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众和坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头严格区别开来的。受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功。我们热情地欢迎“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众迅速猛醒，起来造武汉地区党内、军内一小撮资产阶级代表人物和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头的反，尽快地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和革命造反派工人一起抓革命促生产。
    六、对于那些犯有严重罪行的“百万雄师”中的坏头头，只要他们不再为武汉地区党内、军内的资产阶级代表人物卖力，改邪归正，我们同样给予出路。如果继续与人民为敌，破坏抓革命促生产，我们将给予严厉的打击，并积极协助有关部门依法惩处。
    此告
    武汉地区无产阶级革命派总指挥部
              一九六七年七月三十一日
