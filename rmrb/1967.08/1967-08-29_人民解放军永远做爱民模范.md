Under the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, a new high tide of "supporting the army and loving the people" is surging across the country. This is a powerful driving force for the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The more the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary groups in various places cherish and support the People's Liberation Army, the more we must be modest and prudent, and do our utmost to cherish all revolutionary groups, cherish all Red Guards, and cherish all revolutionary masses. The broad cadres and fighters of our army will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and the trust of the people. We must hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" and always be a model of loving the people.

Chairman Mao said: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." Our People's Liberation Army is cherished by the people because we are Chairman Mao's army, the people's own army.

The People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the concentrated expression of the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people, and it is the lifeblood and soul of our army. Faithfully executing and resolutely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to be loyal to the highest interests of the people, and it is the greatest love for the people.

In the past, our army followed Chairman Mao in making revolution. To realize Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, countless heroes fought bravely and shed their blood. Because of this, the people regard us as their own kin, and a relationship of blood and flesh that cannot be broken by any force has been established between the army and the people, a relationship of fish and water. Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has put higher demands on our army. We must resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The people will support it a thousand times, ten thousand times. If we deviate even slightly from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, it will harm the interests of the people and weaken the unity between the army and the people, which is absolutely not allowed. If there are any mistakes, they must be corrected immediately, corrected a thousand times, ten thousand times, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. As long as we do this, the people will welcome it and support it, and the prestige of the army will not be lowered but will be even higher, and the unity between the army and the people will be even more intimate.

Our People's Liberation Army comes from the people, relies on the people, and is for the people. Everything is done according to the will of the people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary leftists, with defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their first life, are selfless, active, and hardworking, full of revolutionary spirit and spirit of sacrifice. They are the vanguard of the people. Their revolutionary actions represent the will of the broad masses of the people, represent the interests of the broad masses of the people, and represent the direction of social progress. Loving the people, first of all, is to love the proletarian revolutionary groups and support the leftists. If we separate from the revolutionary leftists, we will fundamentally separate from the broad masses of the people. We must share the fate and breath with the broad proletarian revolutionary groups, unite closely, and hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and fight shoulder to shoulder to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and all class enemies are most afraid of the army and the people uniting closely to fight them more powerfully. What the enemy fears, we must resolutely do. All cadres and fighters of our army must maintain high vigilance and prevent class enemies from stirring up trouble between the army and the people and taking advantage of the chaos.

Chairman Mao said: "The army should solve the problem of the thought of every cadre and fighter, so that they thoroughly understand the importance of supporting the government and loving the people. As long as the army does well, the relationship between the local area and the army will improve accordingly." Chairman Mao's instruction more than twenty years ago has even greater practical significance today. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our army is undertaking the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries," playing an important role in helping the proletarian revolutionary groups to seize power, hold power, and use power correctly. Therefore, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have a greater responsibility to handle the relationship between the army and the people. If the relationship between the army and the people is not handled well, our army should actively make self-criticism and be a model of unity. We must respond most enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," be more active, more proactive, and make the relationship between the army and the people better and better.

### 人民解放军永远做爱民模范

    人民解放军永远做爱民模范
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明号召下，一个“拥军爱民”的新高潮正在全国蓬勃兴起。这是胜利推进无产阶级文化大革命的强大动力。
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众越是爱护和支持人民解放军，我们越要谦虚谨慎，尽一切责任，爱护一切无产阶级革命派，爱护一切红卫兵革命小将，爱护一切革命群众。我军广大指战员决不辜负毛主席的期望和人民群众的信赖，一定要更加高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，永远做爱民的模范。
    毛主席说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们人民解放军所以受到人民的拥护，就是因为我们是毛主席的军队，是人民自己的军队。
    毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪同志直接指挥的人民解放军，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是最广大人民群众的最大利益的集中表现，是我军的生命和灵魂。忠实执行和坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是忠于人民的最高利益，就是最大的爱民。
    过去，我们军队紧跟毛主席闹革命，为了实现毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无数先烈英勇奋斗，流血牺牲。正因为这样，人民群众把我们看成自己的亲人，军民之间建立了任何力量也打不破的血肉相联的关系，鱼水相依的关系。今天，无产阶级文化大革命，对我们军队提出了更高的要求。我们坚决按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事，人民群众就会一千个拥护，一万个拥护。如果稍稍离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就会损害人民的利益，削弱军民的团结，那是绝对不能允许的。如有错误，就必须立即改正，千改万改，就是要迅速回到毛主席无产阶级革命路线上来。只要这样做，人民群众就欢迎，就拥护，军队的威信不是低了而是更高了，军民之间的团结就会更加亲密无间。
    我们人民解放军，来自人民，依靠人民，为了人民，一切以人民的意志为意志。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的革命左派，以捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为第一生命，大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干，充满着革命精神和牺牲精神。他们是人民中间的先锋分子。他们的革命行动，代表着广大人民群众的意志，代表着广大人民群众的利益，代表着社会前进的方向。爱民，首先就是要热爱无产阶级革命派，支持左派。脱离了革命左派，就从根本上脱离了广大人民群众。我们要和广大的无产阶级革命派同命运，共呼吸，紧密团结，高举革命的批判大旗，为彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，争取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而并肩战斗。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一切阶级敌人，都最害怕军民紧密团结起来，同他们进行更有力的斗争。敌人害怕的事，我们就要坚决去做。我军全体指战员，必须保持高度警惕，严防阶级敌人挑拨军民关系，混水摸鱼。
    毛主席说：“军队中应当从每个指战员的思想上解决问题，使他们彻底认识拥政爱民的重要性。只要军队方面做好了，地方对军队的关系必会跟着改善。”毛主席在二十多年前的这个指示，在今天有着更加重要的现实意义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们军队担负着“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，在帮助无产阶级革命派夺好权、掌好权和用好权方面，起着重要的作用。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命中，处理好军民关系问题，我们负有更大的责任。如果军民之间的关系处理得不好，我们军队应该主动地作自我批评，作团结的模范。我们要最最热烈地响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，更加积极，更加主动，把军民关系搞得好上加好。
