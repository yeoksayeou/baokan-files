The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and under the leadership of the General Staff Party Committee headed by Comrade Yang Chengwu, have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dogs" to the fullest. They have launched a comprehensive criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist element, the great schemer, the great conspirator, and the great warlord Luo Ruiqing and his clique within the General Staff Department, from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives.

	Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army have launched a new wave of deep criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing in the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly purging the poison of the bourgeois military line, and upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, madly opposed the great leader Chairman Mao, opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin. He engaged in treacherous activities to seize the military and the party. He was a great schemer, a great conspirator, and a great warlord, a "time bomb" buried within the military, and the most dangerous enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, this "time bomb" was unearthed on the eve of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To further purge his influence and thoroughly smash the bourgeois command center headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, the revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and under the leadership of the General Staff Party Committee headed by Comrade Yang Chengwu, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dogs." They launched a comprehensive criticism of Luo Ruiqing and his clique within the General Staff Department from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. They held denunciation meetings, accusation meetings, and struggle-criticism meetings extensively, using big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, broadcasts, and various artistic forms. They concentrated their firepower, fiercely criticized and attacked, and everyone was filled with righteous indignation, denouncing and criticizing everywhere, launching a widespread "people's war." Recently, they held a mass meeting of ten thousand people, launching a general attack, deepening the criticism to a new level, and resolutely criticizing and exposing Luo Ruiqing thoroughly.

	In this comprehensive criticism, the revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department always used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, firmly grasping the key to the struggle between the two lines. They thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionism, firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and practiced the new skills of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat to prevent capitalist restoration.

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department unanimously believe that the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing is the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev within the military. The bourgeois military line he stubbornly promoted serves the reactionary political line of the Chinese Khrushchev to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. It is the manifestation of this reactionary political line in the military. He attempted to turn the great People's Liberation Army into a reactionary bourgeois army, a tool for personal ambition, and a tool for restoring capitalism, which is completely futile.

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department used the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on leaders, parties, classes, and masses to criticize Luo Ruiqing's crimes of opposing Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and praising the Chinese Khrushchev. They reviewed the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party and the military, and the history of the struggle between the two lines in the international communist movement. They contrasted the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao with the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and contrasted the Chinese Khrushchev with the Soviet Khrushchev. They emphasized the consistent correctness of Chairman Mao, and exposed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Luo Ruiqing within the military, further strengthening everyone's unlimited love for Chairman Mao and further arousing everyone's deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing. Comrades angrily said: "Luo Ruiqing's efforts to oppose Mao Zedong Thought are to make the seven hundred million people lose their soul and leader, becoming a scattered sand, in order to disintegrate the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. This is completely a fantasy, impossible by a thousand or ten thousand means!"

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department used Chairman Mao's theory on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration to expose Luo Ruiqing's trick of using the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. They revealed and criticized his treacherous activities to seize the military and the party. Everyone said: "No matter how many layers of skin Luo Ruiqing has, using the Mao Zedong Thought mirror to expose demons will reveal his true form." Comrades listed his evil history, pointing out: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Luo Ruiqing was an active supporter and follower of the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming, recognizing the enemy as a father and greatly praising Chiang Kai-shek. After the socialist revolution deepened, he joined Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, and others to form a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. With the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, they first directed their arrows at our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, using extremely treacherous and vicious methods, attempting to achieve their evil goal of seizing the military and the party.

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department used the proletarian military line of the great leader Chairman Mao to criticize Luo Ruiqing's stubborn promotion of the bourgeois military line. Luo Ruiqing advocated military first, technology first, using "big competitions" to impact politics, opposing politics leading the military; he spread a set of "military is politics," "military and politics should be equally important" opportunist fallacies, opposing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing politics and the four firsts, degrading and weakening our military's political and ideological work; he advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, claiming that the military has no class struggle; he strongly opposed Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, falsifying and distorting Chairman Mao's great instructions on the three implementations of the militia work, attempting to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our military, making our military a tool for them to seize the party and the government.

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department believe that the struggle between the two military lines, in the end, is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for military power. It is an important part of the struggle between the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the anti-restoration by the proletariat under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is an extremely important issue related to the success or failure of the revolution. We must not be the slightest bit complacent.

	The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department believe that thoroughly smashing the treacherous plot of Luo Ruiqing and others to seize the military and the party has created an important condition for the smooth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, these elements are still struggling desperately. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat, and they will make their last struggle." "We must not relax our vigilance." Everyone resolutely stated that they will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," and we must not let these elements have a chance to breathe, come back, and definitely fight them down, making them never able to rise again, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois command center, and completely uprooting the revisionist roots.

	In this current revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department are fighting more bravely, becoming stronger, and wiser. Everyone is determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to raise the great red flag of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even higher, to thoroughly criticize the biggest clique within the party that is taking the capitalist road, to thoroughly criticize the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev within the military such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and the bourgeois military line, to thoroughly eliminate their poison from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and to build the General Staff Department into a red Mao Zedong Thought school along the brilliant revolutionary path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao.

    大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威
    大树特树伟大毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，在毛主席、林副主席和中央军委、中央文革小组的正确领导下，在以杨成武同志为核心的总参党委领导下，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，对反革命修正主义分子、大野心家、大阴谋家、大军阀罗瑞卿和他在总参谋部的一小撮帮凶，从政治上、思想上、理论上展开了大批判。
    新华社二十三日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，在革命的大批判中，掀起了深入批判反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的新高潮，彻底肃清资产阶级军事路线的流毒，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，是在中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持下，疯狂地反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，进行篡军反党的阴谋活动的大野心家、大阴谋家、大军阀，是埋藏在军内的一颗大“定时炸弹”，是无产阶级专政的一个最危险的敌人。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，这个大“定时炸弹”在无产阶级文化大革命的前夕被挖了出来。为进一步肃清他的影响，彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，在毛主席、林副主席和中央军委、中央文革小组的正确领导下，在以杨成武同志为核心的总参党委领导下，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，对罗瑞卿和他在总参谋部的一小撮帮凶从政治上、思想上、理论上展开了大批判。普遍举行了声讨会、控诉会、批判斗争会，充分运用大字报、黑板报、墙报、广播和各种文艺形式，集中目标，集中火力，狠批猛打，人人义愤填膺，处处口诛笔伐，展开了深入广泛的“人民战争”。最近又召开了万人大会，举行了总攻击，把大批判深入一步，提高到一个新水平，坚决把反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿批深批透、斗倒斗臭。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，在这场大批判中，始终以毛泽东思想为武器，紧紧抓住两条路线斗争的纲，大破反革命修正主义，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大练无产阶级专政条件下防止资本主义复辟，进行阶级斗争的新本领。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派一致认为：反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿是中国的赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人，他顽固推行的资产阶级军事路线，是为中国的赫鲁晓夫反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的反动政治路线服务的，是这条反动政治路线在军事上的表现。他妄想把伟大的人民解放军变成资产阶级的反动的军队，变成个人野心家的工具，变成复辟资本主义的工具，这完全是徒劳的。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于领袖、政党、阶级、群众的学说，批判罗瑞卿反对毛主席，反对林副主席，吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。他们摆党内军内两条路线的斗争史，摆国际共产主义运动中两条路线的斗争史，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线作对比，用中国赫鲁晓夫同苏联赫鲁晓夫作对比，大讲毛主席一贯英明、伟大、正确，大揭中国赫鲁晓夫和他在军队中的代理人罗瑞卿的罪行，使大家进一步增强了对毛主席的无限热爱，进一步激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿的无比仇恨。同志们愤怒地说：“罗瑞卿挖空心思反对毛泽东思想，就是要叫七亿人民失去灵魂和统帅，变成一盘散沙，以便瓦解无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。这完全是妄想，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！”
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，运用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的理论，戳穿罗瑞卿打着“红旗”反红旗的诡计，揭露和批判他篡军反党的阴谋活动。大家说：“不管罗瑞卿的画皮有多少层，用毛泽东思想的照妖镜一照，就现出了原形。”同志们列举了他的罪恶历史，指出：罗瑞卿在抗日战争时期，就是王明右倾机会主义路线的积极支持者和追随者，认贼作父，大肆吹捧蒋介石。社会主义革命深入以后，他又同彭真、陆定一、杨尚昆等，结成反革命修正主义集团，在中国的赫鲁晓夫支持下，首先把矛头指向我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，采取了非常阴险毒辣的恶劣手段，妄图实现他们篡军、篡党的罪恶目的。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，运用伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，批判罗瑞卿顽固推行的资产阶级军事路线。罗瑞卿鼓吹军事第一、技术第一，用“大比武”来冲击政治，反对政治统帅军事；他散布一套“军事就是政治”、“军政应该并重”等折中主义即机会主义的谬论，反对林副主席关于突出政治和四个第一的指示，贬低和削弱我军的政治思想工作；他鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，宣扬军队没有阶级斗争；他竭力反对毛主席关于人民战争的思想，篡改和歪曲毛主席关于民兵工作三落实的伟大指示，妄图用资产阶级世界观改造我们的军队，使我军成为他们篡党、篡政的工具。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派认为，两条军事路线的斗争，归根结底，就是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺兵权的斗争，是无产阶级专政条件下资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个重要组成部分，是关系到革命成败的极端重大的问题，决不可有丝毫的麻痹大意。
    总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派认为，把罗瑞卿等篡军反党阴谋彻底粉碎，为我国无产阶级文化大革命顺利开展创造了一个重要条件，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。但是，这些家伙，还在垂死挣扎。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”大家坚决表示，一定要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，决不能让这些家伙得到喘息，卷土重来，一定要把他们斗倒，叫他们永世不得翻身，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把修正主义根子彻底挖掉。
    在当前这场革命大批判中，总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派愈战愈勇，愈战愈强，愈战愈有智慧，大家决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更高地举起毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿等，大破资产阶级反动路线，大破资产阶级军事路线，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底清除他们的流毒，大立毛泽东思想，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命的光辉航道，把总参谋部机关建设成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
