	Attempting to Rescue the Economic Crisis Hit by the Heavy Blow of the Great Strike
	The British in Hong Kong Request the U.S. to Include Hong Kong in the "U.S. Aid Plan"

	New China News Agency, Hong Kong, August 8th – According to a report by the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 7th, the British authorities in Hong Kong are currently in contact with the U.S. government, requesting that the U.S. government include Hong Kong in the "U.S. Aid Plan" to compete for "massive orders" from the U.S. troops invading Vietnam. They aim to rescue the severe crisis in Hong Kong's steel industry.

	The report states that the above information was admitted by a spokesperson from the British "Commerce Department" on the 6th when responding to a reporter's inquiry. The British authorities in Hong Kong openly acknowledged that they are trying to get out of economic difficulties by providing war supplies to the U.S. troops invading Vietnam, which is the first time they have done so. The spokesperson from the British "Commerce Department" also revealed that, in order to obtain orders from the U.S. military in South Vietnam, British "officials" are working together with the "leading figures" of Hong Kong's steel industry.

	The "Ta Kung Pao" pointed out that under the influence of the joint strike, Hong Kong factories have seen a significant reduction in orders, and some industries are facing the risk of closure, especially the steel industry. Out of the 27 steel factories in Hong Kong, 10 have already closed. The British authorities are at a loss in the face of the economic crisis caused by the heavy blow of the joint strike and have placed their hopes on providing war supplies to the U.S. troops invading Vietnam. They are willing to tie Hong Kong's economy to the U.S. war chariot in Vietnam.

    企图挽救在大罢工沉重打击下出现的经济危机
    港英要求美帝把香港列入“美援计划”
    新华社香港八日电　据香港《大公报》七日报道，港英当局正在同美国政府接触，要求美国政府把香港列入“美援计划”之内，以争取侵越美军的“巨大订单”，企图挽救香港钢铁工业的严重危机。
    报道说，上述消息是港英“工商处”发言人六日答复记者询问时供认的。港英当局明目张胆地承认通过为侵越美军提供战备物资来摆脱经济困难，这还是第一次。港英“工商处”发言人还透露，为了从南越取得美军的订单，港英“官员”正和香港的“钢铁业首脑分子”“共同努力”。
    《大公报》指出，在联合大罢工的影响下，香港工厂订单大减，一些工业已经出现倒闭风，特别是钢铁工业，全港二十七家钢铁工厂已有十家倒闭。港英对于在联合大罢工沉重打击下出现的经济危机，束手无策，竟然把希望寄托在为侵越美军提供战备物资上，不惜把香港的经济缚在美国侵越的战车上。
