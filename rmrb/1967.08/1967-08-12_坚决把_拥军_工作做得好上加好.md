In the great battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, as we hear the triumphant songs of victory, we received the latest instructions from our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, our Deputy Commander Lin Biao, to the People's Liberation Army: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Upon hearing this great call, all the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in our factory enthusiastically cheered. This is the greatest concern, the greatest care, and the strongest support from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the entire army and the revolutionary cadres across the country. We must strive even harder to follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army," and love the army as we love our own eyes, doing an even better job in supporting the military. We will closely cooperate with and fight shoulder to shoulder with the PLA to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The People's Liberation Army, created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is a great army that is highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready, holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is an unparalleled army of the people. In the past, they fought bloody battles to win the red base for us; today, they are fighting on the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carrying out the great tasks of "three supports and two militaries," making tremendous new contributions to the people. The victory of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries' seizure of power in January was achieved with the resolute support of the PLA; the counter-revolutionary economic wind that once swept across the city was repelled by the PLA fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries in factories, rural areas, ports, and docks. When the PLA's propaganda teams entered our factory, the first major task they undertook was to help us study and apply Chairman Mao's works, launching a new wave of intensive study, enabling us to more consciously grasp Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployments, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. They live, eat, work, study, and fight with us, teaching us by example, passing on the precious experiences and fine traditions of the army's emphasis on politics, helping us to wield power correctly and use it well, establishing a good new order of revolution and production in our factory. In the first and second quarters of this year, we have completed the state plan in terms of quality, quantity, and variety.

In our interactions with the PLA, we have deeply felt: without the PLA, there would be no proletarian dictatorship, no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and none of our revolutionary achievements. From the bottom of our hearts, we shout: "Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao; a thousand good things are not as good as the PLA." We revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries believe that fighting together with the PLA in a great criticism is the best way to support the military. Currently, the revolutionary criticism is further developing in depth in our factory, with criticism based on work teams sweeping across the entire factory. We must concentrate our strength and wisdom to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their backer, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, ensuring they never rise again!

At this critical moment of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters, we must strengthen our combat unity with the PLA a thousand times, hold high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people," and forever stand together with the PLA, fight together, and win together, creating new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

     坚决把“拥军”工作做得好上加好

    在彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，从北京传来我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志对人民解放军的最新指示：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”我们全厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众听到这个伟大号召以后，最热烈地欢呼，这是毛主席和党中央对全军和全国无产阶级革命派最大的关怀，最大的爱护，最有力的支持。我们一定要更加努力地遵循毛主席“相信和依靠人民解放军”的教导，象爱护自己眼睛一样地“爱军”，把“拥军”工作做得好上加好，同解放军密切合作、并肩战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的伟大军队，是举世无双的人民子弟兵。过去，他们浴血奋战，为我们打下了红色江山；今天，他们又战斗在无产阶级文化大革命的第一线，执行“三支”、“两军”的伟大任务，为人民作出了巨大的新贡献。上海无产阶级革命派一月夺权的胜利，是在解放军的坚决支持下取得的；一时弥漫全市的反革命经济主义妖风，是解放军深入工厂、农村、港口、码头和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗击退的。解放军驻沪部队毛泽东思想宣传队一进我们厂，第一件大事，就是帮助我们活学活用毛主席著作，掀起大学习的新高潮，使我们能够比较自觉地掌握毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，紧紧把握斗争大方向。他们和我们同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，言传身教，把部队突出政治的宝贵经验和优良传统传给我们，帮助我们掌好权、用好权，使我们厂建立起了良好的革命和生产的新秩序，今年一、二季度都按质、按量、按品种超额完成国家计划。
    在和解放军相处的日子里，我们亲身体会到：没有解放军，就没有无产阶级专政，就没有无产阶级文化大革命，就没有我们革命群众的一切。我们发自内心地欢呼：爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲，千好万好不如人民解放军好。我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众认为，同解放军一起奋勇投入革命的大批判，是最好的拥军。目前，革命大批判正在我厂进一步向纵深发展，以班组为基点的大批判正在全厂掀起。我们要更加集中力量，集中智慧，把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总后台的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，让他们永世不得翻身！
    在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的关键时刻，我们一定千百倍地增强同解放军的战斗团结，更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，永远同解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
