The Chinese Embassy in Burma Exposes the Brutal Persecution of Patriotic Overseas Chinese by the Burmese Reactionary Government
The Ne Win Reactionary Government Must Immediately Release the Detained Patriotic Overseas Chinese
Embassy Staff Represent the People of the Motherland to Comfort the Families of Persecuted Patriotic Overseas Chinese

	New China News Agency, August 17th: Rangoon News: On August 14th, the Chinese Embassy in Burma handed over a protest note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, exposing the brutal persecution of detained patriotic overseas Chinese by the Burmese reactionary government, and once again sternly demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all patriotic overseas Chinese who have been illegally arrested and detained, and the immediate cessation of any form of persecution against the detained patriotic overseas Chinese. Before their release, arrangements must be made for diplomatic officials from the Chinese Embassy and the families of the detained patriotic overseas Chinese to visit them.

	The note pointed out: The Ne Win reactionary government, disregarding the repeated stern warnings from the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Embassy in Burma, not only continues to refuse to release the large number of patriotic overseas Chinese students, teachers, and parents who have been illegally arrested by them, but also continues to illegally arrest patriotic overseas Chinese on trumped-up charges in Rangoon and throughout Burma. In prisons, the military, police, and secret agents of the Ne Win reactionary government are brutally persecuting the detained patriotic overseas Chinese. Currently, dozens of patriotic overseas Chinese students, teachers, and parents are being held in the Insein Prison on the outskirts of Rangoon, with their lives in grave danger. According to preliminary investigations by the Embassy, the following patriotic overseas Chinese have been illegally arrested and detained in Rangoon alone by the Ne Win reactionary government: Overseas Chinese students Guan Derong, Jiang Qijian, Jiang Liling, Li Shaosong, Tan Tingwei; Overseas Chinese teachers Li Jinbin, Jian Qianbing, Cao Bingzhuang, Wen Ping, and Chen Qijia; Overseas Chinese parents and workers Chen Bofu, Chen Tianhuang, Yang Laozhu, Lin Chenglong, ?? Zhongquan, Wang Weizhong, Liu Yingchao, Dong Chuanxi, Chen Tianfu, Lai Baoluo, Wang Lianfa, Wang Sixia, Zhao Runqi, Yang Jinnan, Jiang Zhangyi, Ruan Yongtang, Dai Yanding, Wu Shangfu, Zhang Shuhong, Lin Shiyang, Zhao Jianling, Huang Xiangming, Zeng Yaru, Li Panhua, Ye Fucheng, etc. The note said: The Chinese Embassy must point out that among the aforementioned detained patriotic overseas Chinese, eight individuals, namely Wang Weizhong, Dong Chuanxi, Wu Shangfu, Zhang Shuhong, Lin Shiyang, Zhao Jianling, Chen Qijia, and Huang Xiangming, were released by the Burmese government at 4 PM on August 3rd. However, on the very next day, August 4th, the Burmese government rearrested them and threw them back into prison. Here, the Embassy questions the Burmese government: After illegally detaining them for over a month, you released them on August 3rd, which completely proves their innocence and completely proves that your initial arrest of them was entirely unjustified. Now, why, after releasing them, do you so eagerly rearrest them and throw them into prison? In truth, you are acting out of guilt, fearing that your conspiracy to illegally arrest and brutally persecute the detained patriotic overseas Chinese will be exposed. Your ironclad evidence of illegally arresting and brutally persecuting patriotic overseas Chinese is overwhelming, and no matter what tricks you play, you cannot escape responsibility.

	The note said: We once again warn you: Patriotic overseas Chinese are the good children and flesh and blood of the Chinese people, and loving the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and loving the motherland is their sacred and inviolable right. You dare to continue persecuting them, which is a blatant provocation against the great seven hundred million Chinese people. The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate this. If you ignore our repeated warnings and dare to harm the detained patriotic overseas Chinese, the Chinese people will absolutely not forgive you and will surely give you the severest punishment.

	According to the New China News Agency, August 17th: Rangoon News: Recently, diplomatic staff from the Chinese Embassy in Burma have extensively visited the families of overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution in the anti-China riots orchestrated by the Ne Win reactionary government in Rangoon.

	The staff of the Chinese Embassy, representing the seven hundred million people of the motherland and all Chinese comrades working in Burma, expressed deep sympathy and great concern to the families of the victims. The families of the overseas Chinese victims were very affectionate when they saw the staff from the Chinese Embassy, and many of them had tears in their eyes. They told the staff from the Chinese Embassy, "You are sent by Chairman Mao to visit us." "We are proud and grateful to have the support of Chairman Mao and the seven hundred million people of the motherland."

	The families of the overseas Chinese victims angrily denounced to the staff from the Chinese Embassy the heinous crimes of the Ne Win fascist regime in organizing thugs to brutally massacre overseas Chinese.

    我驻缅使馆揭露缅甸反动政府残酷迫害爱国华侨的罪行
    奈温反动政府必须立即释放被捕爱国华侨
    我使馆人员代表祖国人民慰问受迫害的爱国华侨家属
    新华社十七日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆八月十四日交给缅甸外交部一份抗议照会，揭露缅甸反动政府残酷迫害被捕爱国华侨的罪行，再次严正要求立即无条件地全部释放被非法逮捕和关押的爱国华侨，立即停止对被捕爱国华侨的任何形式的迫害，在释放前，立即安排中国大使馆外交官员和被捕爱国华侨家属前往探望。
    照会指出：奈温反动政府悍然不顾中华人民共和国政府和中国驻缅甸大使馆的多次严正警告，不仅迄今拒绝释放被其非法逮捕的大批爱国华侨学生、教师和家长，而且在仰光和全缅各地以莫须有的罪名，继续非法逮捕爱国华侨。在监狱中，奈温反动政府的军人、警察和特务对被捕爱国华侨进行着残酷的迫害。现在数十名爱国华侨学生、教师和家长被关押在仰光近郊的永盛监狱之中，生命毫无保障。据大使馆初步调查，仅仰光一地被奈温反动政府非法逮捕和关押的爱国华侨有：华侨学生椁德荣、江启建、江俪林、李绍松、谭廷伟；华侨教师黎锦镳、简倩冰、曹炳庄、温平和陈启家；华侨家长和职工陈伯甫、陈天煌、杨老注、林成隆、?忠泉、王维中、刘应超、董传溪、陈添福、赖保罗、王莲发、王思华、赵润畦、杨基南、蒋章漪、阮永棠、戴炎鼎、伍尚赋、张树洪、林士扬、赵俭龄、黄祥铭、曾亚如、李泮华、叶福清等人。照会说：中国大使馆必须指出，上述被捕爱国华侨中的八人，即王维中、董传溪、伍尚赋、张树洪、林士扬、赵俭龄、陈启家和黄祥铭曾于八月三日下午四时被缅甸政府释放。但是，就在他们被释放的第二天，八月四日，缅甸政府又把他们再次逮捕投入黑牢。在这里，大使馆要责问缅甸政府：你们在非法关押他们一个多月之后于八月三日释放了他们，这就完全证明了他们是无罪的，完全证明了你们当初逮捕他们是毫无道理的。现在，你们为什么在释放了他们以后又如此迫不及待地把他们逮捕入狱呢？说穿了，你们是作贼心虚，你们是害怕你们非法逮捕和残酷迫害被捕爱国华侨的阴谋被戳穿。你们非法逮捕和残酷迫害爱国华侨的铁证如山，不管你们再耍什么花招，想赖是赖不掉的。
    照会说：我们再次警告你们：爱国华侨是中国人民的好儿女，是中国人民的亲骨肉，热爱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和热爱祖国完全是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利。你们胆敢继续迫害他们，就是对伟大的七亿中国人民的肆意挑衅。中国人民对此绝对不能容忍。假如你们无视我们再次的警告，竟敢对被捕爱国华侨狠下毒手，中国人民绝对饶不了你们，一定要给你们以最严厉的惩罚。
    据新华社十七日讯  仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆外交人员，最近在仰光广泛探望了在奈温反动政府策划的反华暴行中遭受迫害的华侨受难者的家属。
    中国大使馆人员代表祖国七亿人民和在缅工作的全体中国同志向受难者家属表示深切的同情和巨大的关怀。华侨受难者的家属见到中国大使馆人员时，极为亲切，很多人热泪盈眶。他们向中国大使馆人员说：“你们是毛主席派来看望我们的。”“我们为有毛主席和祖国七亿人民的支持感到欣慰和自豪。”
    华侨受难者家属向中国大使馆人员愤怒控诉了奈温法西斯政权组织暴徒野蛮屠杀华侨的滔天罪行。
