"Ten thousand li of the Yangtze River crossed, gazing at the vast sky of Chu." On the day celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great People's Liberation Army of China, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, along with some soldiers who have been fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses, totaling more than 50,000 people, today followed the course personally opened by the great leader Chairman Mao, successfully crossed the Yangtze River.

Today, Wuhan is under a clear blue sky. The surging Yangtze River is adorned with red flags and echoes with thunderous songs. More than 50,000 heroes, filled with passion, said: This is a grand celebration of the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan entering a new stage of victory. This is a grand review of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the unity of the military and the people in Wuhan. At the same time, this is a grand rally for the military and people of Wuhan to press on with victory, vowing to thoroughly criticize and denounce the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Wuhan.

On July 16, 1966, our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, swam across the Yangtze River, inspecting the broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan and the river-crossing heroes. Over the past year, Wuhan has undergone earth-shaking changes. The proletarian revolutionary masses have emerged from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. The PLA support-left troops, at the critical moment of the struggle, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, vowing to be the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Together with the people, they have defeated the repeated frenzied counterattacks of a handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road. In no time, those "giant monsters" have become rats that everyone wants to beat, sinking into the vast ocean of people's war.

At the head of Wuchang Bridge, under the Snake Hill, more than 50,000 soldiers waiting to set off, read aloud again and again Chairman Mao's quotations: "The Yangtze River, others say it is very big, but in fact, big is not frightening. The U.S. imperialists are not big? We have stood up to them and there is nothing to fear. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not frightening."

The oath-taking rally held before entering the water sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to express respect. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the support-left troops of the stationed army in Wuhan unanimously declared: "The iron gate of the pass is like iron, but now we step forward from the beginning to cross it." The editorial in the 12th issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, "The proletariat must firmly grasp the gun," and "Fiercely open fire on the main enemy of the people," have sounded the new advance call for us. We are facing new and more arduous tasks. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, be more vigilant, and work harder to do a good job of "supporting the army and loving the people." We must more actively educate and help the deceived masses to quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will organize a mighty proletarian revolutionary army to further launch a new high tide of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to thoroughly criticize and denounce the "falling dogs." We will forever follow the victorious course indicated by Chairman Mao and advance bravely!

At 8:25, three red signal flares soared into the sky, and the bugle calls echoed. The river-crossing heroes jumped into the surging waves of the great river one after another.

The giant portrait of our most beloved and reddest red sun, the great leader Chairman Mao, has always been at the forefront of this river-crossing army, guiding the proletarian revolutionary masses to advance victoriously in the stormy waves.

An army composed of revolutionary workers from "Steel General" and "Steel 9.13" and other organizations swam over. The revolutionary rebels who had been suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line were overjoyed and exultant, holding high the battle flags that had been tempered by many battles, swimming shoulder to shoulder with the PLA soldiers in the great river, breaking waves forward. The revolutionary workers and the PLA soldiers have forged a deeper combat friendship in their struggle against the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Wuhan. Today, when they swam into the river, the strong wind rolled up huge waves. The heroes sometimes emerged from the waves, sometimes walked on the wave layers. They advanced in the stormy waves, once again showing a more intimate and united class sentiment. They encouraged each other as they advanced bravely, shouting "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!" "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionary masses!" The slogans echoed along both banks of the river. In this swimming army, many had been persecuted multiple times by the bourgeois reactionary line, and some had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." However, their revolutionary spirit was even stronger. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, they advanced bravely, persisted in the struggle, and finally achieved one victory after another.

The vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution—the brave Red Guards swam over. They were nearly 20,000 soldiers from revolutionary organizations such as "Steel 2nd Bureau," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance." In the proletarian cultural revolution, they had waged a heroic struggle against the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Wuhan. In the storms of class struggle, they had tempered a steel frame and a red heart. Today, they advanced against the wind and waves, waving their arms forward on the course personally opened by our great leader Chairman Mao.

Many soldiers from "Steel 2nd Bureau" said, on July 16 last year, Chairman Mao swam with us, we saw our most beloved and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and our hearts were filled with boundless excitement. We made a vow to forever advance on the course opened by Chairman Mao! Today, in the victory song, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have sent us a letter. This is the greatest support, encouragement, and care for us proletarian revolutionary masses. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, deeply, thoroughly, and completely criticize the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Wuhan, and achieve new and greater victories in the proletarian cultural revolution!

The PLA stationed in Wuhan, who firmly support the proletarian revolutionary masses, wearing military uniforms and badges with Chairman Mao's shining portrait, carrying Chairman Mao's giant portrait and slogans, followed the proletarian revolutionary masses in the marching tune of the "March of the Volunteers," showing their determination to be the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The soldiers participating in the river crossing also wore red armbands of "Steel General," "Steel 2nd Bureau," "Steel 9.13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance," looking particularly spirited. The soldiers said, we are crossing the Yangtze River wearing the armbands of revolutionary leftist organizations to learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses, to unite with them, fight with them, and win with them, advancing bravely on the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao.

This unprecedented river-crossing activity lasted more than five hours. Along both banks of the Yangtze River and in the great river, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and the recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations never stopped, fully expressing the boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the PLA soldiers in Wuhan to the great leader Chairman Mao, and fully demonstrating the determination of the military and the people to unite and follow the course opened by Chairman Mao, riding the wind and breaking the waves to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

On August 1, the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan, surrounded by Chairman Mao's portrait and slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Support the army and love the people," shouted slogans and crossed the Yangtze River.

    沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的航道破浪前进
    武汉地区五万军民“八一”建军节横渡长江
    新华社武汉一日电　“万里长江横渡，极目楚天舒。”在庆祝伟大的中国人民解放军建军四十周年的日子里，从阶级斗争大风大浪中胜利冲杀出来的武汉地区无产阶级革命派和人民解放军驻武汉陆海空三军中紧紧同无产阶级革命派战斗在一起的部分指战员等共五万多人，今天沿着伟大领袖毛主席亲自开辟的航道，胜利横渡了长江。
    今天，武汉晴空万里。奔腾的长江，红旗招展，歌声震天。五万多健儿满怀激情地说：这是欢庆武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命进入新的胜利阶段的大庆祝，这是武汉地区无产阶级革命派大团结、军民大团结的大检阅，这同时也是武汉军民乘胜追击，誓把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人批倒批臭的大誓师。
    一九六六年七月十六日，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席畅游长江，检阅了武汉广大革命群众和渡江健儿。一年来，武汉地区发生了天翻地覆的变化，无产阶级革命派从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中杀出来了，解放军支左部队在斗争的关键时刻，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，军民一起打败了党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一次又一次的疯狂反扑，曾几何时，那些“庞然大物”都成了人人喊打的过街老鼠，陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海。
    在武昌桥头，蛇山脚下五万多名待发的战士，一遍又一遍地朗读着毛主席语录：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”
    入水前举行的誓师大会，给毛主席发了致敬电。武汉地区无产阶级革命派和驻军支左部队指战员一致表示：“雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”《红旗》杂志第十二期社论《无产阶级必须牢牢掌握枪杆子》《向人民的主要敌人猛烈开火》，给我们吹响了新的进军号。我们面临着更新、更艰巨的任务。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，更加百倍提高警惕，更加努力地作好“拥军爱民”工作，更加积极地教育、帮助受蒙蔽的群众迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，组织起一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，进一步掀起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命的大批判、痛打“落水狗”的新高潮，永远沿着毛主席指引的胜利航道奋勇前进！
    八点二十五分，三颗红色信号弹腾空而起，军号阵阵，渡江健儿纷纷跃入波涛滚滚的大江。
    最敬爱的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像，一直在这支渡江大军的最前面，引导着无产阶级革命派在大风大浪中胜利前进。
    一支由“钢工总”、“钢九·一三”等革命工人组织战士组成的大军游过来了。曾经受到资产阶级反动路线压制的革命造反派，欢欣鼓舞，扬眉吐气，高举着几经战斗洗礼的战旗，和解放军指战员的游泳队伍肩并肩地在大江中破浪前进。革命工人和解放军指战员，在向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人的斗争中，结下了更加深厚的战斗友谊。今天当他们游入江心时，阵阵劲风，卷起惊涛巨浪，健儿们时而出入浪涛之中，时而信步于浪层之上。他们在大风大浪里前进，再一次表现了更加亲密、更加团结的阶级感情。他们一边奋勇前进，一边互相鼓励，高呼“向中国人民解放军致敬”“坚决支持无产阶级革命派”，口号声震动大江两岸。在这支游泳大军中，有不少人曾经多次受到资产阶级反动路线的迫害，有的人被打成“反革命”。然而，他们的革命精神更加坚强，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们勇往直前，坚持斗争，终于取得了一个又一个胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋——英勇的红卫兵革命小将游过来了。他们是“钢二司”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等革命组织的近两万名战士。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们与中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人进行了英勇的斗争。在阶级斗争的风浪中，他们炼出了一副钢筋铁骨，炼出了一颗赤胆红心。今天，他们在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自开辟的航道上，顶风破浪，挥臂前进。
    “钢二司”的许多战士说，去年七月十六日，毛主席同我们一起游泳，我们看见了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，心情无比激动，立下誓言，决心永远在毛主席开辟的航道上前进！今天，在胜利的凯歌声中，党中央和毛主席又给我们来了信。这是对我们无产阶级革命派的最大支持，最大鼓舞，最大关怀。我们一定听毛主席的话，把对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人的大批判，搞深搞透搞彻底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更新更伟大的胜利！
    坚决支持无产阶级革命派的解放军驻武汉部队指战员，穿着军装，佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，抬着毛主席巨幅画像和标语牌，在《解放军进行曲》的军乐声中，紧跟在无产阶级革命派的队伍后面前进，表示坚决做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。参加横渡长江的指战员，还分别带着“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”的鲜红袖章，显得格外精神。指战员们说，我们带着革命左派组织的袖章横渡长江，就是向无产阶级革命派学习，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进。
    这次规模空前的渡江活动，历时五个多小时，长江两岸，大江之中，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”的口号声，朗读毛主席语录的声音，始终不断，充分地表达了武汉地区无产阶级革命派和人民解放军指战员对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的激情，也充分显示了军民团结决心沿着毛主席开辟的航道，乘风破浪把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。（附图片）
