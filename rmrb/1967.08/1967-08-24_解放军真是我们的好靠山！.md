The Revolutionary Masses of the Beijing Municipal Power Supply Bureau Great Alliance Department, under the impetus of the January Revolution in Shanghai, seized the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture in the bureau on January 19. For seventeen years, this enterprise with over 3,000 workers had been controlled by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Now, it is truly in the hands of the revolutionary masses.

However, a small clique within the bureau that is taking the capitalist road harbors deep resentment towards our seizure of power. They incited and deceived some of the masses who were unaware of the truth, forming conservative organizations. They took advantage of our open rectification to completely negate our revolutionary actions of seizing power and created public opinion to counter-seize power. During that period, it truly seemed like "dark clouds pressing down on the city, ready to collapse it."

Chairman Mao and we revolutionary masses are heart to heart. He is most concerned about us revolutionary masses. At the moment when we were in a difficult situation, on March 17, Chairman Mao sent us the People's Liberation Army. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They came, and we had a reliable backbone.

As soon as the PLA arrived, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought, widely contacted the masses, and conducted in-depth investigations and research. After a series of efforts, in early April, the PLA comrades and all the staff of our Great Alliance Department had a meeting. They helped us review the path we had taken in the previous period, systematically summarized our work, and affirmed that our general direction had always been correct. They affirmed that we are a revolutionary mass organization. The strong support and help from the PLA gave us great encouragement.

The PLA comrades affirmed our general direction and also pointed out our shortcomings and mistakes. They sincerely pointed out to us that true revolutionary masses must not only dare to revolutionize but also know how to revolutionize, and must always act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies. In this regard, the PLA comrades set a good example for us.

The PLA comrades organized us to study Chairman Mao's works as soon as they arrived, helping us to correctly handle the two types of contradictions and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. They suggested that we study together with the deceived masses and hold joint criticism meetings. Initially, some of our comrades did not understand this point and firmly disagreed. We thought: We are the genuine revolutionary masses, how can we sit on the same bench with the conservatives? Isn't this just compromising? The PLA comrades seriously pointed out: This is absolutely not compromising. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." We must definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do thorough and detailed ideological work, unite with all those who can be united, and correctly treat the deceived masses. At the same time, the PLA comrades also helped us create conditions to carry out activities unit by unit, section by section, and department by department. Through study and various activities, both sides gradually came into contact, understood each other, and many deceived masses withdrew from the conservative organizations, requesting to join the Great Alliance Department. This event taught us deeply, making us realize the harm of individualistic revolutionary thinking, small-groupism, and sectarianism to the proletarian revolutionary cause. At the same time, we also further realized: The PLA is most loyal to Chairman Mao, most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Through this event, we trust the PLA even more and love the PLA even more.

When the PLA comrades first arrived, some leaders and masses of the conservative organizations often went to find the PLA comrades, saying how correct their general direction was and how wrong we were. However, the PLA comrades did not listen to one side and speak for the other, but patiently talked with them, presented facts and reasoned with them, awakening their consciousness, sometimes even talking through the night. At the beginning, we did not quite understand this, and some comrades even had complaints, thinking that the PLA contacted them too much and us too little; some were worried that the conservative organizations might confuse the PLA and make it difficult for them to distinguish right from wrong. However, as time went on, some leaders of the conservative organizations discovered a pattern: their masses, after talking with the PLA comrades, either became "waverers" or directly turned against them. Later, several of their main leaders also successively withdrew from the conservative organizations and expressed their willingness to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This event had a great impact on the masses of the conservative organizations and also educated and moved us.

In several months of joint struggle, a deep class sentiment was established between us and the PLA comrades. We are as close as kin, like brothers, with nothing to hide, and everything to discuss. They seriously and earnestly criticized our shortcomings and mistakes, and repeatedly reminded us to learn the five conditions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao, and to learn the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." Using Chairman Mao's instructions and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to examine our actions, we tempered ourselves into steadfast leftists of the proletarian revolution.

Through these living facts, we deeply realized: The People's Liberation Army of China is truly the invincible people's army personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. They raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on words. Their proletarian stance is the most firm, their banner is the most distinct, their implementation of policies is the most resolute, and they have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are worthy of our good study and eternal learning.

### 解放军真是我们的好靠山！

    解放军真是我们的好靠山！
    北京市供电局无产阶级革命派大联合总部
    北京市供电局无产阶级革命派大联合总部，在上海“一月革命”风暴的推动下，于一月十九日一举夺了局里党、政、财、文大权。十七年来，被旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团把持的一个具有三千多职工的大企业，真正由无产阶级革命派掌权了。
    但是，供电局党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对我们的夺权恨得要死。他们煽动和蒙蔽一些不明真相的群众，成立了保守组织，利用我们开门整风的机会，全盘否定了我们夺权的革命行动，并且为他们反夺权大造舆论。在那一段时间里，真有“黑云压城城欲摧”之势。
    毛主席和我们革命派心连心，他老人家最关心我们革命派。正在我们处境困难的时刻，三月十七日，毛主席他老人家给我们派来了中国人民解放军。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派。他们来了，我们有了靠山。
    解放军一来就宣传毛泽东思想，广泛接触群众，深入进行调查研究。经过一系列的工作，四月初，解放军同志和我们大联合总部全体工作人员座谈，帮助我们回顾前一段所走的道路，系统地总结工作，肯定了我们的大方向始终是正确的，肯定了我们是革命群众组织。解放军的大力支持和帮助，给了我们极大的鼓舞。
    解放军同志肯定了我们的大方向，也指出了我们的缺点和错误。他们诚恳地向我们指出，真正的革命派，既要敢于革命，又要善于革命，要时时、事事都按照毛主席的教导和党的方针政策办事。在这方面，解放军同志为我们作出了好榜样。
    解放军同志一来就组织我们学习毛主席著作，帮助我们正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。他们建议我们和受蒙蔽群众一块学习，联合举行批判大会。起初，我们一些同志对这一点很不理解，坚决不同意。我们认为：我们是响当当的革命派，怎么能和保守派同坐一条板凳呢？这样做岂不是和稀泥吗？解放军同志严肃地指出：这绝不是和稀泥。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，做深入细致的思想工作，团结一切可以团结的人，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众。同时，解放军同志又帮助我们创造条件，以行政班、组、科室为单位开展活动。通过学习和各种活动，双方互相接触，逐渐了解，许多受蒙蔽群众纷纷退出保守组织，要求参加大联合总部。这件事对我们教育很深，使我们认识到唯我革命、小团体主义、宗派主义等小资产阶级思想对无产阶级革命事业的危害性。同时，我们也进一步认识到：解放军最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想。通过这件事，我们更加信赖解放军，更加热爱解放军。
    解放军同志刚来时，保守组织的一些负责人和群众经常去找解放军同志，说他们自己大方向如何正确，我们如何错误。可是，解放军同志没有偏听偏信，而是不厌其烦地和他们交谈，向他们摆事实讲道理，启发他们的觉悟，有时竟谈一通宵。对于这一点，开始我们不太理解，有的同志甚至有埋怨情绪，认为解放军接触他们太多了，接触我们太少了；有的担心保守组织这样颠倒是非，可能使解放军一时真假难辨。可是，时间一长，保守组织中的一些负责人发现了一条规律：他们的群众和解放军同志交谈一次，不是变成“动摇分子”，就是干脆反戈一击。后来，他们的几个主要负责人也相继退出保守组织，并且表示愿意站到毛主席的革命路线上来。这件事对保守组织的群众震动很大，同时也教育了我们，感动了我们。
    在几个月的共同战斗中，我们和解放军同志之间建立了深厚的阶级感情。我们之间亲如骨肉，情同手足，无话不说，无事不谈。他们对我们的缺点、错误给予严肃认真的批评，而且一再提醒我们要学习毛主席提出的培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，学习林副主席的指示：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”用毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示来检验我们的行动，使我们锻炼成为无产阶级的坚定的革命左派。
    通过这些活生生的事实，我们深深地认识到：中国人民解放军真不愧为伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪副主席直接指挥的、举世无双的战无不胜的人民军队。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫。他们的无产阶级立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明，执行政策最坚决，对无产阶级文化大革命作出了伟大贡献。他们值得我们好好学习，永远学习。
