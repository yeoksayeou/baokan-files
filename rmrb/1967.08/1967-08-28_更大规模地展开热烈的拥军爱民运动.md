The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories. We are advancing victoriously. The situation is excellent.

The great proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution carried out under the dictatorship of the proletariat. One of its very important characteristics is that it must strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and in no way allow it to be damaged or weakened.

The People's Liberation Army of China, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great bulwark for defending the national security of our socialist motherland and safeguarding the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao says: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." Without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no dictatorship of the proletariat, and there would be no great proletarian cultural revolution.

In our country, the fundamental guarantee for carrying out this unprecedented, broad-scale great proletarian cultural revolution and achieving thorough victory is the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible thought of Mao Zedong; it is the great People's Liberation Army of China, which is absolutely loyal, loving, and worshipful of our great leader Chairman Mao.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought has wholeheartedly supported, protected, and humbly learned from the proletarian revolutionary masses. They have taken Chairman Mao's great teaching that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses as the guiding principle for their "three supports, two militarizations" work. They have shared the same breath, fate, and hardships with the proletarian revolutionary masses in the struggle against the enemy, consolidating and developing the combat friendship between the army and the people.

The great People's Liberation Army has not only made tremendous efforts and achieved outstanding results in completing the glorious and arduous tasks of the "three supports, two militarizations" assigned by Chairman Mao, but has also made new contributions and achieved new victories in defending the borders, seas, and airspace of our motherland and maintaining internal security.

To push the great proletarian cultural revolution forward and achieve more brilliant victories on the road ahead, it is necessary for the People's Liberation Army to unite more closely with all proletarian revolutionary factions, all Red Guards, and all revolutionary masses; it is necessary for the army and people throughout the country to launch a large-scale and enthusiastic movement to support the army and love the people.

All proletarian revolutionary factions throughout the country must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, raise the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, always believe in, support, and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army.

Supporting the army and loving the people is a strategic slogan for advancing the great proletarian cultural revolution and a general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and the revolutionary masses during the great proletarian cultural revolution. We must have a comprehensive and profound understanding of this slogan. By understanding this slogan, we can correctly analyze and recognize the current situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution, correctly handle the relationship between the army and the people, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

In the People's Liberation Army, our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong enjoy absolute authority. Especially since Comrade Lin Biao has been in charge of the Military Commission, the army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on the Four Firsts, carried forward the Three-Eight Style, and launched the Four Good Units movement, making the entire army more proletarian and more combat-ready. After more than a year of great proletarian cultural revolution, the People's Liberation Army has undergone great tempering, and the relationship between the army and the masses has become even closer. Such a unique people's army is absolutely trusted by the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses.

The People's Liberation Army is the children of the people. The relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the people is one of flesh and blood, like fish and water.

The People's Liberation Army must do everything possible to cherish the proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses. Similarly, the proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses must do everything possible to support the People's Liberation Army.

The People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards, and all mass organizations must formulate new army-loving, people-loving agreements based on the specific situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution in their localities.

The army-loving, people-loving agreements must reflect Chairman Mao's thoughts: to believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres.

The army-loving, people-loving agreements must reflect Chairman Mao's thoughts: the People's Liberation Army must firmly support the proletarian revolutionary factions, support the Red Guards, and support the revolutionary masses.

The army-loving, people-loving agreements must reflect Chairman Mao's thoughts: the people must assist the People's Liberation Army in doing a good job of the "three supports, two militarizations," and must assist the army in doing a good job of preparing for war and consolidating national defense.

The army-loving, people-loving agreements must also reflect Chairman Mao's thoughts: both sides should carry out open, mass self-criticism to address their own shortcomings and mistakes. When necessary, they can also offer suggestions to the other side, but they must follow Chairman Mao's correct principles for handling contradictions among the people and adopt appropriate methods that are conducive to unity and the great proletarian cultural revolution. When there are disputes, they must be resolved through consultation.

Absolutely do not confuse the boundaries between enemy and people's internal contradictions and treat comrades with the methods used against enemies.

A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the enemies of the proletariat, fear the People's Liberation Army the most and fear the close unity between the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary factions the most. They always try every means to sow discord and sabotage. All cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and all revolutionary mass organizations, must be vigilant and never fall for the enemy's tricks. Necessary dictatorial measures must be taken against the sabotage activities of active counter-revolutionaries.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, let the army and people unite closely! Let all proletarian revolutionary factions, all Red Guards, all revolutionary masses, and all patriotic people unite! Let us launch a great new wave of supporting the army and loving the people!

### 更大规模地展开热烈的拥军爱民运动

    更大规模地展开热烈的拥军爱民运动
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大胜利。
    我们正在胜利地前进着。在前进的道路上，形势一片大好。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的革命。它的一个很重要的特点就是，必须有利于巩固和加强无产阶级专政，而决不允许破坏或削弱这个专政。
    毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导和林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的最坚强的柱石，是保卫我们社会主义祖国的国防安全、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大支柱。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”没有人民解放军，就没有无产阶级专政，也就没有无产阶级文化大革命。
    在我国，能够进行这场史无前例的、规模广阔的无产阶级文化大革命，并且能够取得彻底胜利的根本保证，就是有我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想；就是有对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚、无限热爱、无限崇拜的伟大的中国人民解放军。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派，保护无产阶级革命派，虚心向无产阶级革命派学习。他们把毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大教导，作为部队“三支”、“两军”工作的行动指南。他们与无产阶级革命派同呼吸，共命运，风雨同舟，患难与共，在对敌斗争中巩固和发展了军民之间的战斗友谊。
    伟大的人民解放军，不仅在完成毛主席交给的“三支”、“两军”的光荣而又艰巨的任务中，作出了巨大的努力，取得了杰出的成绩，而且在保卫祖国的边防、海防、空防以及内地治安的伟大斗争中，作出了新的贡献，建立了新的战功。
    为着把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进，为着让无产阶级文化大革命在前进的道路上取得更辉煌的新胜利，这就需要人民解放军同一切无产阶级革命派、一切红卫兵革命小将和一切革命群众，更紧密地团结起来；这就需要全国各地军民更大规模地展开一个热烈的拥军爱民的运动。
    全国广大的无产阶级革命派一定要遵照毛主席的教导，高举拥军爱民的旗帜，永远相信人民解放军，拥护人民解放军，依靠人民解放军，学习人民解放军。
    拥军爱民，是推进无产阶级文化大革命的战略口号，是正确处理无产阶级文化大革命中军队和革命群众关系的总原则。对这个口号，我们一定要作全面的深刻的理解。理解了这个口号，就能正确地分析与认清当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势，就能正确处理军民之间的关系，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    在人民解放军里，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，享有绝对的权威。特别是林彪副统帅主持军委工作以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展四好连队运动，整个部队更加无产阶级化了，更加战斗化了。经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，人民解放军经受了极大的锻炼，军队和群众的关系更加密切了。这样一支举世无双的人民军队，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，是无限信赖的。
    人民解放军是我国人民的子弟兵。人民解放军同人民群众的关系，是血肉相联的关系，是鱼水相依的关系。
    人民解放军要尽一切责任，爱护无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众。同样，无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众，要尽一切责任，拥护人民解放军。
    人民解放军同无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和一切群众组织，必须根据当地无产阶级文化大革命的具体情况，制定新的拥军爱民公约。
    拥军爱民的公约，必须体现毛主席的思想：要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。
    拥军爱民的公约，必须体现毛主席的思想：人民解放军应当坚决支持无产阶级革命派，支持红卫兵革命小将，支持革命群众。
    拥军爱民的公约，必须体现毛主席的思想：人民群众必须协助人民解放军搞好“三支”、“两军”的工作，必须协助解放军搞好备战和巩固国防的工作。
    拥军爱民的公约，还必须体现毛主席的思想：双方面各自实行公开的、群众性的自我批评，处理自己发生过的缺点和错误。对待他方面，在必要时也可以提意见，但必须按照毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，采取适当的有利于团结、有利于无产阶级文化大革命的方式。双方有问题争执的时候，必须用协商的方法解决。
    绝对不能混淆敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界限，用对待敌人的办法来对待自己的同志。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，无产阶级的敌人，最害怕人民解放军，最害怕人民解放军同无产阶级革命派紧密团结。他们总是千方百计地进行挑拨离间，进行破坏。人民解放军全体指战员，一切革命群众组织，千万要提高警惕，千万不要上敌人的当。对于现行反革命分子的破坏活动，必须采取专政措施。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指导下，军民紧密地团结起来！一切无产阶级革命派，一切红卫兵革命小将，一切革命群众，一切爱国的人们，团结起来！掀起一个伟大的拥军爱民的新高潮。
