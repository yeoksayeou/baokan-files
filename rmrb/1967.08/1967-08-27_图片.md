The People's Liberation Army Navy unit stationed in Qingdao is actively supporting the revolutionary dock workers of the Qingdao Port Authority in their loading and unloading tasks. They treat the port and dock as a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The image shows soldiers and officers from a certain unit of the Navy studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together with revolutionary workers during a break from labor, determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" with practical actions.    Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xingli.
