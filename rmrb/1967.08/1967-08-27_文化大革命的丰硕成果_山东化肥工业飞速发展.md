The revolutionary workers and cadres on the chemical fertilizer production front in Shandong Province have thoroughly criticized the sabotage and obstruction of the development of the fertilizer industry by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has enabled the province's fertilizer industry to develop rapidly along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. The province began planning to build fertilizer factories in 1958, but by the end of 1964, only two had been completed and put into production. In 1966 alone, seven new small-scale fertilizer plants were built and put into production, and this year, sixteen more fertilizer plants have started construction, with some already completed and in production, and others nearing completion. The production capacity of these new fertilizer plants is approximately twenty-eight times the total nitrogen fertilizer production of the province in 1964. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    文化大革命的丰硕成果  山东化肥工业飞速发展
    山东省化学肥料生产战线上的广大革命职工和革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东代理人对发展化肥工业的种种阻挠和破坏，使全省化肥工业建设沿着毛主席的革命路线飞速发展。这个省从一九五八年开始筹建化肥工厂，到一九六四年底，只有两处建成投入生产；而一九六六年一年内新建成并投入生产的小型化肥厂就有七个，今年全省又有十六个化肥厂开工兴建，目前有的已建成投入生产，有的接近建成。这些新建化肥厂的生产能力，相当于一九六四年全省氮肥总产量的二十八倍左右。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！（据新华社讯）
