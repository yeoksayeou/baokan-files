The unity of the military and the people is invincible. Let us see who can stand against us! Revolutionary masses of the proletariat, broad revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army of China, both land, sea, and air forces, have been carrying out large-scale activities to support the army and love the people in recent days, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. The whole country, hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, are shouting in unison: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" They unanimously declare: Resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to support the army and love the people, and definitely further strengthen military-civilian unity, jointly fight against the enemy, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Starting from August 1st, large and medium-sized cities, factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools across the country have held grand celebrations, military-civilian banquets, and symposiums and condolence meetings to celebrate the 40th anniversary of our army. Tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel gathered together, enthusiastically cheering for the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically cheering for Chairman Mao's great military thought that has opened the only correct path to victory for the Chinese people, and pointed out the broad road to true liberation for the proletariat and oppressed peoples of the world, enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people over the past 40 years, and enthusiastically praising the new achievements of this new-type people's army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the celebrations and banquets, the military and civilian personnel learned from each other, encouraged each other, and shared the new combat friendship forged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The whole country presented a moving scene of the military loving the people and the people supporting the military.

In the capital, more than 50,000 revolutionary masses of the proletariat and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force held grand banquets in Zhongshan Park and the Great Hall of the People on the previous two days. At the celebration meetings held in Shanghai and Tianjin, the military and civilian personnel unanimously declared that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, love the military, support the military, unite as one, and hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a new wave of revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as the representative, and fighting them to the end.

During this period, military-civilian celebration meetings and banquets were held in various places across the country. In Jinan City, a celebration meeting with more than 7,000 participants was held. Chengdu City held a military-civilian banquet. Harbin City held a military-civilian banquet with 8,000 participants. In Qingdao City, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the garrison held a celebration meeting and parade with 100,000 participants. In Guiyang and Kunming Cities, celebration meetings with tens of thousands and twenty thousand participants were held respectively in the past two days. During the celebrations and banquets, the garrison in Qinghai and the "August 18th" revolutionary masses of the proletariat exchanged Mao Zedong's works and Mao badges. The revolutionary youths of the "August 7th Commune" in Henan also went to the garrison of the People's Liberation Army that firmly supports the leftists and had a banquet with the soldiers. At the celebration meeting held in Hohhot with more than 10,000 participants, the representative of the Red Guards Third Command of Hohhot pointed out in his speech that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should not only be the pioneers of revolution and the vanguard of revolutionary criticism but also be the models of supporting the military, forever uniting with the People's Liberation Army, fighting together, and winning together.

The troops stationed on the front lines of the country's borders and coastal defenses celebrated the glorious day with the local people. The heroic troops of the land, sea, and air forces on the front lines of Fujian, while maintaining high alert and being ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time, sent a large number of propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought to the masses to propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and performed rich and colorful cultural performances, having banquets with the masses. The border guards stationed in the front lines of the South China Sea, Tibet, and the Ili Valley also held celebration and banquet activities with the local residents in the past two days.
