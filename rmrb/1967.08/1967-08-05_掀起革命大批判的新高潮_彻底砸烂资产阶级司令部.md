One year ago today, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote a shocking big-character poster—“Bombard the Headquarters.” This poster sounded the charge for the proletarian revolutionaries to bravely attack the bourgeois headquarters headed by China’s Khrushchev, signaling the general mobilization for the proletariat to launch a full-scale offensive against the bourgeoisie.

In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, China’s Khrushchev stubbornly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, spewing out the evil bourgeois reactionary line, confusing right and wrong, black and white, suppressing the revolutionary factions, and implementing white terror. They labeled workers, students, and revolutionary cadres who dared to rebel against them with various crimes, such as “ambitious schemers,” “fake leftists, true rightists,” and so on, attempting to suppress the vigorous proletarian cultural revolution and preserve their bourgeois headquarters.

A thunderclap shook the earth. Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster reached Shanghai. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee were terrified, hating it to death and fearing it to death, using every means to suppress it. However, Chairman Mao’s voice cannot be suppressed. The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai, who had suffered greatly from the bourgeois reactionary line, were moved to tears, spreading the word and reciting our great leader Chairman Mao’s great call. They broke through the bourgeois reactionary line’s encirclement and fought their way out.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai’s industrial front firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they launched a fierce attack against the capitalist-roaders in power, finally exposing and overthrowing the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee in the storm of the “January Revolution” and establishing the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee with proletarian authority.

All this fully demonstrates the boundless power of Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster!

Today, the country is launching a new high tide of criticism against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Revolutionary criticism is aimed at thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China’s Khrushchev and thoroughly purging all the poison spread by this bourgeois headquarters in every field and on every front. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The enemy will not perish of itself.” We proletarian revolutionaries must further carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, deeply develop revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly bury the bourgeois headquarters.

While bombarding the bourgeois headquarters, we will not allow the class enemy to confuse the two headquarters, seize our revolutionary slogans to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and direct the cannon at the proletarian headquarters, disrupting proletarian dictatorship and revolutionary order. If the class enemy dares to bombard the proletarian headquarters, we proletarian revolutionaries will give them a resounding blow.

Today, as we revisit Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster, which has great historical significance, we must push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works to a new stage, thoroughly smash non-proletarian thoughts, and thoroughly smash the “bourgeois headquarters” in our own minds. We must strive to overcome the influences of factionalism, opportunism, and localism, promote the revolutionization of thought, consolidate and develop the broad revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core, unite all those who can be united, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    掀起革命大批判的新高潮彻底砸烂资产阶级司令部
    上海工人革命造反总司令部
    一年前的今天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席写了一张震撼大地的大字报——《炮打司令部》。这张大字报，吹响了无产阶级革命派向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部勇猛进攻的冲锋号，是无产阶级向资产阶级发动总攻击的动员令。
    文化大革命初期，中国的赫鲁晓夫顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，抛出了罪恶的资产阶级反动路线，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，实行白色恐怖。他们把敢于起来造他们反的工人、学生和革命干部，加上了种种罪名，什么“野心家”、“假左派，真右派”等等，妄图把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去，保住他们资产阶级的司令部。
    一声春雷，震天动地。毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报传到了上海，旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派丧魂落魄，他们恨得要命，怕得要死，千方百计加以封锁。但是，毛主席的声音是封锁不住的，深受资产阶级反动路线迫害的上海的无产阶级革命派，热泪盈眶，奔走相告，传诵着我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召。他们冲破了资产阶级反动路线的重重包围，杀出来了。
    在毛主席的革命路线指引下，上海工业战线的无产阶级革命派牢牢掌握了斗争大方向，和广大革命群众一起，向走资本主义道路当权派猛冲猛打，终于在“一月革命”风暴中，把旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统统揪了出来，打翻在地，并且建立了有无产阶级权威的上海市革命委员会。
    这一切，充分显示了毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报的无穷威力！
    今天，举国上下正在掀起一个批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的新高潮。革命的大批判，就是要彻底砸烂以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，就是要在各条战线、各个领域里彻底肃清这个资产阶级司令部所散布的一切流毒。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们无产阶级革命派，一定要进一步发扬炮打资产阶级司令部的革命精神，深入开展革命的大批判，把资产阶级司令部彻底埋葬掉。
    在炮打资产阶级司令部的同时，我们决不允许阶级敌人混淆两个司令部，把我们革命的口号接过去进行反革命活动，把炮口指向无产阶级司令部，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏革命秩序。阶级敌人胆敢炮打无产阶级司令部，我们无产阶级革命派就给予迎头痛击。
    今天我们重温毛主席《炮打司令部》这张具有伟大历史意义的大字报，要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，大破非无产阶级思想，彻底砸烂自己头脑中的“资产阶级司令部”。我们要努力克服山头主义、风头主义、小团体主义的影响，促进思想革命化，巩固和发展以左派为核心的广泛的革命大联合，团结一切可以团结的人们，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
