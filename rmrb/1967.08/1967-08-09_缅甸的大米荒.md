Burma was once one of the world's largest rice-producing countries and a major exporter of rice. Due to long-term British colonial rule, Burma remains a backward agrarian country. In Burma, 85% of the population lives in rural areas. Agricultural output (mainly rice) accounts for about 70% of the total industrial and agricultural output. Agricultural exports (mainly rice) often account for 85% to 95% of total foreign exchange earnings. However, under the reactionary rule of the Ne Win clique, Burma's rice production and exports have significantly declined. Burma, once known as the rice granary of Southeast Asia, has become a land of hunger.

The Ne Win clique came to power in 1962. According to official Burmese announcements, the rice production for the 1962-1963 fiscal year was 72.9 million tons, while for the 1966-1967 fiscal year, it dropped to 65 million tons. Rice exports, which were 30 million tons before World War II and 20 million tons ten years ago, were 17 million tons in the 1962-1963 fiscal year and dropped to 11 million tons in the 1965-1966 fiscal year. This year, it is estimated to be only 4.7 million tons.

Burma has always been a country with surplus grain. Even during World War II, when the entire country became a battlefield, there was no famine. However, now Burma's rice supply is extremely tight, and there are food shortages everywhere. Last year, the Ne Win reactionary government sold 983,000 tons of rice domestically, but this year, there are only 710,000 tons of rice available for domestic consumption, with more than half already sold. Currently, there are only 200,000 to 300,000 tons left. This amount of rice is not enough to last until the end of the year when the new harvest season begins.

In reality, Burma's current rice production is not enough to feed its own people. However, the Ne Win reactionary regime, in order to patch up its crumbling economy and earn foreign exchange, disregards the lives of the people and insists on exporting some rice, making the rice famine in Burma even more severe.

Currently, in Rangoon, each person can only buy one can of rice per day, and children can only buy half a can (each can is about five and a half Chinese taels). Restaurants have rationed their supplies, sometimes only serving dishes without rice. Other cities like Mandalay, Mawlamyine, and Bassein are also experiencing food shortages. Many rural areas have resorted to eating grass roots and tree bark. Many factory workers have left their jobs due to lack of food. The fat and greedy Ne Win clique is taking advantage of the situation, engaging in black market speculation, and further exploiting the Burmese people. The price of grain in the Rangoon market has risen by one to two times. In some counties, the free market price of rice has increased by thirty times. The famine in Burma, caused by the Ne Win clique, is spreading and intensifying, sparking increasing discontent and resistance from the broad masses of the people.

### 缅甸的大米荒

    缅甸的大米荒
    缅甸过去是世界上生产大米最多的国家之一，也是世界上输出大米的主要国家之一。
    由于长期英国殖民统治的结果，缅甸依然是一个落后的农业国。在缅甸人口中，农村人口占百分之八十五。农业产值（以稻米为主）在工农业总产值中约占百分之七十左右。农产品的出口（以大米为主）经常占全部外汇收入的百分之八十五至九十五。但是，在奈温集团的反动统治下，缅甸的大米产量和出口都大大下降。素以东南亚米仓著称的缅甸，变成了饥饿之乡。
    奈温集团是一九六二年上台的。据缅甸官方宣布，一九六二——一九六三年度的大米产量是七百二十九万吨，而一九六六——一九六七年度则下降到六百五十万吨。大米出口，第二次世界大战前是三百万吨，十年前是二百万吨，一九六二——一九六三年度是一百七十万吨，一九六五——一九六六年度下降到一百一十万吨，今年估算只有四十七万吨。
    缅甸一向是粮食有余的国家，即使在第二次世界大战期间，缅甸全国都变成了战场，也没有发生饥荒。但是，现在缅甸大米供应十分紧张，各地都在大闹粮荒。去年，奈温反动政府在国内销售了大米九十八万三千吨，而今年，仅有七十一万吨大米供国内消费，其中一大半已经售出，目前就只剩下二、三十万吨了。这样一点大米，是不可能维持到年底新作物收割季节的。
    实际上，缅甸的大米产量现在已根本不够本国人民食用。但是奈温反动政权为了弥补其千疮百孔的经济，搜刮外汇，完全不顾人民死活，硬要挤出些大米出口，这就使缅甸的大米荒更加严重了。
    目前，在仰光，每人每天只能买到一牛奶罐大米，小孩每天半罐（每罐约合中国五两多一点）；饭馆已限量供应，有时只供应菜，而不卖饭。其他城市如曼德勒、毛淡棉、勃生等地都发生粮荒。很多农村已经出现了吃草根树皮的现象。许多工厂的工人因为没有饭吃而离开了工厂。脑满肠肥的奈温集团却趁火打劫，大搞黑市投机活动，加紧剥削缅甸人民。仰光市场上粮食价格已上涨了一至二倍。有的县自由市场米价上涨了三十倍。奈温集团一手造成的缅甸饥荒正在扩大蔓延，激起了广大人民越来越强烈的不满和反抗。
