Two small reservoirs in Shandong Province experienced different outcomes during a heavy rainfall on June 30 due to varying levels of flood preparedness.

One is the Yanxu Reservoir in Mengyin County. Despite 100 millimeters of rainfall and the water level rising to within 8 centimeters of overflowing, a team of over 100 people led by PLA officers rushed to repair the dam. They successfully fought off the flood and ensured the safety of the reservoir.

The other is a newly built dam in Mengzhuang Commune, Zoucheng County. With 118 millimeters of rainfall, the spillway had not been dug to the required standard, and no rescue team was organized in time. As a result, the water overflowed the dam, destroying the project and causing significant damage.

    防汛准备不同出现两种后果
    山东省两个小型塘坝水库，在六月三十日暴雨袭击下，由于防汛准备不同，出现了两种不同的结果。
    一个是蒙阴县燕峪水库，在降雨一百毫米、洪水位只差八公寸就要漫坝的情况下，解放军干部带领一百多人的抢险队，奋力抢修，战胜了洪水，保证了水库的安全。
    另一个是诸城县孟疃公社，有个今年新建的塘坝，在降雨一百一十八毫米的情况下，由于溢洪道未挖够标准，又没有及时组织抢险队伍，结果大水漫坝，冲垮了工程，造成很大损失。
