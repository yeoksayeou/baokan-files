Edition: 3

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the socialist stage of history, there are still classes, class contradictions, and class struggle; there is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism; and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." During the three years of economic difficulty, at a critical moment when class struggle was extremely sharp, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, in collusion with the domestic and foreign class enemies, fiercely attacked the proletariat by vigorously advocating the "Three Freedoms and One Contract." The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" undermines the collective economy of the people's communes, allowing capitalism to run rampant. It goes against the firm belief of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist road and reflects the demands of a small number of landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants with spontaneous capitalist tendencies. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" is of the same ilk as the policy of developing new rich peasants that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique vigorously promotes in the Soviet countryside; it is a continuation of the counter-revolutionary policy of the Chinese Khrushchev, who has long advocated the development of the rich peasant economy, fiercely opposed collectivization, opposed the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and is part of his plot to restore capitalism. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" is a thoroughgoing revisionist line!

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, taking class struggle as the key link, holding high the great banner of the General Line, have checked the black wind of the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" and repelled the arrogant attack of the bourgeoisie. The people's communes have been further consolidated and developed, agricultural production has made new leaps, and the cause of socialism presents a prosperous scene.

In the revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Lan Village People's Commune in Jimo County, Shandong Province, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, used ironclad facts to expose the true colors of the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" and hit the vital points of the Chinese Khrushchev. Below is a record of one of their criticism meetings.

"The 'Three Freedoms and One Contract' is the restoration of capitalism"

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system." The top capitalist-roader in the Party is the representative of these people. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" he vigorously advocates is a black wind for the restoration of capitalism.

During the three years of economic difficulty in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev, in collusion with the domestic and foreign class enemies' anti-China chorus, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao and socialism, attempting to reverse the wheel of history, and said, "In industry, we must retreat sufficiently, and in agriculture, we must also retreat sufficiently, including contracting production to households and individual farming!" "The free market must still be operated." His henchmen followed his black directives, vigorously promoting "contracting production to households" and opening "free markets." In our Fourth Brigade, Seven Teams, eight varieties of "land distribution" were implemented, dividing most of the collective land.

As a result, our Fourth Brigade again saw polarization between the rich and the poor. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, especially the "four categories, two types of households" (families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, and cadres, as well as five-guarantee households and households in difficulty), lacked labor, tools, and fertilizer. They plowed and sowed at the wrong times, and the contracted land lay fallow. Without the collective support, they became poorer day by day, and the situation of selling houses and land reappeared. A few people engaged in speculation and profiteering, or because they had strong labor power and more reclaimed land, their income was high, and they became rich. What is this if not going back to the old road? If we continue like this, we will follow the road of Soviet revisionism. Landlords and the bourgeoisie will climb back onto the heads of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we will suffer twice. The whole of Lan Village and the whole of China will change color. Thinking of this, we hate the Chinese Khrushchev, this big bad guy, to death. (Bo Dong, a poor peasant from the Fourth Brigade)

The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocating the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" is extremely reactionary! In our Fourth Brigade, we followed the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, starting from scratch and developing to have fixed assets of over 40,000 yuan. After implementing the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," more than 40 rooms were damaged, and plows, harrows, water wheels, carts, and threshing machines were gone. Only three of the eight sideline businesses remained. Large livestock and pigs, each totaling more than 60, were lost, and fixed assets were damaged by over 20,000 yuan. Members' debts reached over 70,000 yuan. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" undermined the foundation of the collective economy and was thoroughgoing capitalism. (Wei Yueguang, a poor peasant from the Fourth Brigade)

The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocating the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" opened the door wide for speculation and profiteering, allowing capitalism to run rampant, and ghosts and monsters emerged in droves. At that time, in the Fifth Brigade, six out of eight landlord, rich peasant, counter-revolutionary, and bad elements engaged in speculation and profiteering. The Chinese Khrushchev is the biggest backer of speculators and profiteers. (Sui Risheng, a cadre from the Market Management Office)

The top capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to vigorously promote the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," said, "It is not scary if some bourgeois elements emerge in society. Do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," which thoroughly exposed his wild ambition to restore capitalism. After our commune implemented the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," some members began to neglect the collective, saying, "It is better to let the land lie fallow than to delay Lan Village," and engaged in spontaneous actions, even speculation and profiteering. Some young people gambled and went astray. Some brigade and commune cadres were dragged down by landlords and rich peasants, degenerated, and became new bourgeois elements. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" had serious consequences. (Guan Ruijin, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Commune)

The original head of the Taxation Bureau, due to the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," could not farm his land at home. Every three to five days, he would return home to farm. Speculators and profiteers saw this, and when his child celebrated the "hundredth day," they sent a gift of 60 yuan. Later, they took care of his difficulties in various ways. He ate more and more, and finally developed into a protector of speculators, becoming an agent of the bourgeoisie. He was a cadre from a hired laborer background, had served in the PLA, fought against the Kuomintang, and had not fallen in the rain of bullets and shells, but was hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. This is a serious lesson! (Mou Zhonglian, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Commune)

"The 'Three Freedoms and One Contract' is the demand of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie"

The Chinese Khrushchev said, "In many places, farmers, and even cadres, demand individual farming and contracting production to households," "If you do not allow individual farming, it is not possible. If you do not allow individual farming this year, you will have to do it next year. If you do not allow individual farming, they will do it secretly." This is a great slander against us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary farmers. This bad guy pretends to care about us farmers and speaks on behalf of our farmers' interests. Is this true? No, absolutely not. Chairman Mao said, "There are some people who always stand on the side of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants with spontaneous capitalist tendencies, scheming for a few people, and do not stand on the side of the working class, scheming for the whole country and all the people." The Chinese Khrushchev is such a person. The "Three Freedoms and One Contract" he promotes completely represents the interests and demands of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie. This bad idea was spread to the countryside, and landlords, rich peasants, and speculators and profiteers were overjoyed and clapped their hands in approval. In our village, a landlord shouted madly, "The land is coming back home! The free market is going to be opened again!" On the contrary, when we poor and lower-middle peasants heard about the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," we were all angry and worried that we would go back to the old road. In the past, we did not know who came up with this bad idea. Now we know that it was the Chinese Khrushchev who did it behind Chairman Mao's back. Everyone hates him to the bone. We will definitely settle this account. (Guan Yijin, a poor peasant from the Third Brigade)

In 1961, when the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" was promoted in our area, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, all stood up to oppose it, criticizing, "Contracting production to households and individual farming go against Chairman Mao's instructions and do not conform to the socialist direction." But those capitalist-roaders in the Party would not listen to our poor and lower-middle peasants' opinions. They maliciously said, "Whether it is in the right direction or not, let's do it first and talk about it later." They threatened us, "If you do not implement contracting production to households and suffer a disaster without food, we will not take care of you." Our village implemented it slowly, and they publicly criticized us in a meeting, saying, "Not implementing contracting production to households is not listening to the Party." What nonsense! Chairman Mao calls on us to take the road of collectivization, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will listen to Chairman Mao. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, I will risk my life to fight him. (Zhang Junde, a poor peasant from Daoxiang Village Brigade)

The Chinese Khrushchev slanders that our grassroots cadres demand contracting production to households, which is sheer nonsense. In 1961, Lan Village People's Commune promoted the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," and capitalism ran rampant everywhere. The poor and lower-middle peasants had many opinions, and I also felt that this did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. I reflected all the opinions I heard and thought of to the Party Committee of the Commune. A small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party Committee did not listen at all but criticized me for "not caring about the masses' interests" and slandered me for "eating full meals without working, just finding faults." They also deliberately made things difficult for me in my work. In the struggle, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese Communists who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point believe that their cause is completely just and are willing to sacrifice everything for it, ready to give up their lives for our cause at any time." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me strength and courage, and I repeatedly raised my opinions, but each time I was struck down and retaliated against. Even after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, they still paid lip service to Chairman Mao's instructions but continued to insist on the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," which was intolerable. At a meeting of cadres at four levels convened by the Yantai Municipal Party Committee, I exposed the problem of Lan Village People's Commune Party Committee promoting the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" and vigorously restoring capitalism. As a result, they became even more arrogant in their class revenge against me. In the cold winter, I had just been discharged from the hospital for four days after an induced abortion, and I was also sick and could not get out of bed. However, a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party Committee of the Commune ordered me to dig a drainage ditch. They wanted to drive me to death. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres suffered from their beatings and persecution because they opposed the "Three Freedoms and One Contract." On the contrary, those cadres who actively promoted individual farming and speculation and profiteering were often praised, given subsidies, and promoted. They dared to openly oppose Chairman Mao's instructions, suppress the poor and lower-middle peasants, and strike at revolutionary cadres because the Chinese Khrushchev backed them up and was their backer. To uproot a tree, we must uproot its roots. We must thoroughly overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, not only pulling him down from his horse but also criticizing and defeating him in thought, politics, and theory, making him never able to rise again. (Guan Ruijin)

"Listen to Chairman Mao, persist in the socialist direction, and this is the bright path"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty and improve their lives, to resist disasters, have no choice but to unite and advance on the socialist road to achieve their goals." Our village was originally called Jiangjiazhuang. Before liberation, it was a famous southern wasteland. At that time, there was a folk song:

"Southern wasteland, southern wasteland, eating vegetables and swallowing chaff,
Wearing ragged clothes, living in mud huts,
Drinking bitter water every meal, starving every year."

Fortunately, we welcomed the savior Chairman Mao, who finally rescued us poor and lower-middle peasants from the bitter water pit. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "organize" and took the bright path of socialism. Our lives got better day by day. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents saw that we poor and lower-middle peasants were living a good life and hated it to death. They colluded with the domestic and foreign class enemies' arrogant attacks and issued the black directive of the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," causing serious losses to our brigade.

It was at this time that our great leader Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call to never forget class struggle, speaking the words in our hearts. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, checked the black wind of the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," and repelled the arrogant attacks of the class enemies. After correcting the "Three Freedoms and One Contract," we again held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took class struggle as the key link, and fought against nature. Chairman Mao said: "The masses have boundless creative power. They can organize themselves, advance to every place and department where they can exert their strength, advance to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves." Chairman Mao's great teachings pointed out the direction for us to advance. We decided to rely on the collective's strength, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, to treat the wasteland, alkalinity, and waterlogging. In the winter of 1964, we organized all the members to work continuously for 130 days, digging canals, building culverts, and transforming paddy fields. The yield increased year by year, and the members' lives got better day by day. In 1966, the average yield per mu reached 602 jin, creating a historical record. In 1963, we still needed the state to supply 170,000 jin of grain, but in 1966, we sold 500,000 jin to the state, with an average of 3,623 jin per household sold to the state. In 1965 and 1966, our brigade repaid the state's loans of over 70,000 yuan and bought hand tractors, rice hullers, and transplanting machines, carrying out many basic construction projects. The collective economy was greatly consolidated and developed. The members were so happy that they changed Jiangjiazhuang to Daoxiang Village. Facts speak louder than words. If we had not listened to Chairman Mao and taken the road of collectivization, how could the poor and lower-middle peasants have today's happiness? The villagers composed a couplet: "Mao Zedong Thought shines with golden light, the southern wasteland has completely changed: golden rice piles up like mountains, golden wheat fills the granaries; poor villages become Daoxiang Village, saline-alkali lands become fish and rice lands; every family eats white rice, everyone wears new clothes. The people's commune is powerful, the road of collectivization is broad; forever following Chairman Mao, forever following the Communist Party."

Facts prove that the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party is a wolf that eats people without spitting out the bones, the mortal enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must carry out the great criticism better, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, give this fallen dog a sound beating, thoroughly smash his plot to restore capitalism, and forever advance on the bright path of socialism pointed out by Chairman Mao!

(Zhang Lishan, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, a poor peasant from Daoxiang Village Brigade)

    彻底批判复辟资本主义的“三自一包”
    ——山东省即墨县兰村公社贫下中农和革命干部批判会纪要
    《红旗》杂志编者按：我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”在三年经济困难期间，阶级斗争极其尖锐的关键时刻，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所拚命鼓吹的“三自一包”，就是他伙同国内外阶级敌人向无产阶级发动的一次猖狂进攻。
    “三自一包”瓦解人民公社集体经济，使资本主义自由泛滥。它违背广大贫下中农走社会主义道路的坚定信念，反映了极少数地主富农和具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的要求。“三自一包”同苏修统治集团在苏联农村大力推行的那一套发展新富农的政策完全是一路货色；是中国的赫鲁晓夫长期以来鼓吹发展富农经济、疯狂反对合作化、反对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的反革命政策的继续，是他复辟资本主义的阴谋的一个组成部分。“三自一包”是一条彻头彻尾的修正主义路线！
    广大贫下中农，按照毛主席的教导，以阶级斗争为纲，高举总路线伟大红旗，煞住了“三自一包”的黑风，击退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。人民公社进一步巩固和发展了，农业生产得到了新的跃进，社会主义事业呈现出一片繁荣景象。
    在革命的大批判中，山东省即墨县兰村公社的贫下中农和革命干部，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，用铁的事实，戳穿了“三自一包”的画皮，打中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。下面，是他们的一个批判会的纪要。
    “三自一包”就是复辟资本主义
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度”。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派就是这一部分人的总代表。他所拚命鼓吹的“三自一包”，就是为复辟资本主义刮起的一股黑风。
    在我国三年经济困难期间，中国的赫鲁晓夫配合国内外阶级敌人的反华大合唱，猖狂反对毛主席、反对社会主义，妄想历史的车轮向后倒退，胡说什么“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户、单干！”，“自由市场还是要搞下去”。他的爪牙便按照他的黑指示，大搞“包产到户”，开放“自由市场”。俺四里七队实行“下放土地”的花样，就有八种，把大部分集体土地分了。
    这样一来，俺四里又发生了贫富两极分化。广大贫下中农，尤其是“四属、二户”（军、烈、工、干属及五保、困难户）缺劳力、缺农具、缺肥料，耕不是时候，种不是时候，包产地荒了，又没有了集体的靠山，一天天穷困下去，卖房子卖地的情况又出现了。少数人搞投机倒把，或者因为劳力强，开荒地多，收入很高，发了家。这不是走回头路又是什么？这样搞下去，我们就会走上苏联修正主义的道路，地主、资产阶级又会爬到我们贫下中农的头上来，我们就要受二茬罪，全兰村、全中国都会改变颜色。想到这里，我们恨死了中国的赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋。（四里大队贫农社员董奎法）
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派主张“三自一包”，真是反动透顶了！俺四里大队过去按毛主席指出的道路走，白手起家，发展到有固定财产四万多元。搞“三自一包”以后，坏了四十多间房子，犁、耙、水车、大车、锅驼机也没有了，八种副业只剩下三种。损失大牲口及猪各六十多头，固定财产损失了两万多元，社员负债达七万多元。“三自一包”挖了集体经济的墙脚，是彻头彻尾的资本主义。（四里大队贫农社员魏跃光）
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提倡“三自一包”，为投机倒把大开方便之门，使资本主义自由泛滥，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。那时，五里大队八个四类分子，就有六个搞投机倒把。中国的赫鲁晓夫是投机倒把奸商最大的后台老板。（市场管理所干部隋日盛）
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为了大搞“三自一包”，说什么“社会上产生一些资产阶级分子，并不可怕。不要怕资本主义泛滥”，这彻头彻尾地暴露了他妄想复辟资本主义的狼子野心。我们公社实行“三自一包”后，有的社员开始不关心集体了，说什么“宁愿荒了地，不误兰村集”，专搞自发，甚至投机倒把；有的青年赌博，变坏了。有的大队和公社干部被地主、富农拉下了水，蜕化变质，成为新生的资产阶级分子。“三自一包”造成了严重的恶果。（公社革命委员会筹委会委员管瑞芹）　
   税务所原来的所长，由于“三自一包”，家里地种不上，他每隔三、五天就回家种地。投机倒把分子看在眼里，趁他小孩“过百日”，送了贺礼六十元，以后又多方“照顾”他的困难。他越吃越顺口，最后发展到包庇投机商，成为资产阶级的代理人。他是雇农出身的干部，当过解放军，打过国民党，在枪林弹雨中，他没有倒下，却被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中了，这是多么严重的教训！
          （公社革命委员会筹委会主任牟中连）
   “三自一包”是地主富农资产阶级的要求
    中国的赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“许多地方的农民，甚而至于干部，要求单干，要求分田到户，或者包产到户”，“你不让单干，不行嘛，今年不单干，明年要单干，你不让他单干，他暗单干”。这是对我们广大贫下中农和革命农民的极大污蔑。这个坏家伙，装做好象很关心我们农民，代表我们农民的利益说话。真是这样吗？不是，绝对不是。毛主席说，有一种人“他们老是站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，而没有站在工人阶级的立场上替整个国家和全体人民打主意。”中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这种人，他推行的“三自一包”，完全是代表地主、富农、资产阶级的利益和要求。“三自一包”这个坏主意一传到农村，地主、富农和投机倒把分子就兴高采烈，拍手叫好。俺村有个地主疯狂地叫嚷：“土地又要回家了！自由市场又要开放了！”相反的，我们贫下中农一听说搞“三自一包”，心里都窝火，担心这样下去会走回头路。过去我们不知道是谁出的这个坏主意，现在我们知道了是中国的赫鲁晓夫背着毛主席搞的，人人都恨得牙根痛。这笔帐我们一定要清算。
                （三里大队贫农社员管益锦）
    一九六一年在俺这里推行“三自一包”时，我们广大贫下中农都纷纷起来反对，批评说：“包产到户，分散单干，违背毛主席的指示，不符合社会主义方向。”可是那些党内走资本主义道路当权派，哪里会听我们贫下中农的意见。他们恶毒地说：“不管方向不方向，先搞起来再说。”他们威胁我们：“你们不搞包产到户，要是受了灾，没有粮食吃，我们可不管你们的事。”我们村推行得慢了，他们在大会上公开指名批评，说什么“不搞包产到户就是不听党的话”。真是胡说八道！毛主席号召我们走集体化的道路，我们贫下中农就是要听毛主席的话。谁要反对毛主席，俺豁出这条老命要同他拚上。
                （稻香村大队贫农社员张均德）
    中国的赫鲁晓夫污蔑我们基层干部要求包产到户，完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。一九六一年，兰村公社推行“三自一包”，到处资本主义泛滥，贫下中农意见纷纷，我也觉得这样做不符合毛主席的教导，把听到和想到的意见，都向公社党委反映了。公社党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派根本不听，反而批评我“不关心群众利益”，污蔑我“吃饱饭不干工作，光找岔子”，还在工作中故意刁难我。我在斗争中学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。毛主席的教导给我增添了力量和勇气，我又连续多次提意见，但每次都受到打击和报复。甚至在党的八届十中全会以后，他们对毛主席的指示还是阳奉阴违，继续坚持“三自一包”，真是叫人忍无可忍。我在烟台地委召开的一次四级干部大会上揭发了兰村公社党委推行“三自一包”，大搞资本主义复辟的问题。这样一来，他们就更猖狂地对我进行残酷的阶级报复。寒冬腊月，我人工流产刚出院第四天，又加身体有病，不能起床，公社党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，却强令我去挖排水沟。他们想把我整死。有许多贫下中农和革命干部，因为反对“三自一包”，也遭到这些坏蛋的打击和迫害。相反，那些积极搞单干、积极搞投机倒把的干部，却经常受表扬，给补助，给提级。他们所以敢这样公开地对抗毛主席的指示，压制贫下中农，打击革命干部，就是因为中国的赫鲁晓夫给他们撑腰，做他们的后台。刨树要刨根，我们一定要把中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底打倒，不仅要把他拉下马，还要从思想上、政治上、理论上把他批臭斗垮，使他永世不得翻身。
                                  （管瑞芹）
    听毛主席的话，坚持社会主义方向，才是光明大道
    毛主席教导我们：“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的”。俺村原来叫姜家庄。解放前，是一个有名的南大荒。那时流传着一首歌谣：
  “南荒南荒，吃菜咽糠，穿破衣裳，住破泥房，顿顿喝苦水，年年饿断肠。”多亏盼来了救星毛主席，总算把贫下中农救出了苦水坑。我们遵照毛主席“组织起来”的教导，走上了社会主义光明大道，生活一天比一天好。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，见我们贫下中农过了好日子，恨得要死。他们配合国内外阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，抛出了“三自一包”的黑指示，给俺大队带来了严重损失。
    正是这个时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席在八届十中全会上发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召，说出了俺贫下中农的心里话。我们按照毛主席的教导，煞住了“三自一包”的黑风，击退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。在纠正了“三自一包”以后，我们又高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，向大自然进行了搏斗。毛主席说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”毛主席的伟大教导，给我们指出了前进的方向。我们决心依靠集体的力量，用愚公移山的精神，根治荒碱涝洼。一九六四年冬，我们组织全体社员，连续苦战一百三十天，挖渠道，修涵闸，改稻田，产量连年上升，社员的生活又一天比一天好起来了。一九六六年，平均亩产达到六百零二斤，创造了历史上的最高纪录。一九六三年还要国家供应粮食十七万斤，一九六六年就向国家交售了五十万斤，平均每户向国家交售三千六百二十三斤。一九六五、一九六六这两年，俺大队还了国家贷款七万多元，还买了手扶拖拉机、碾米机、插秧机，搞了好多基本建设，集体经济大大巩固和发展了。社员高兴得把姜家庄改名为稻香村。事实胜过雄辩。要不是听毛主席的话，走集体化道路，贫下中农哪会有今天这样的幸福。俺村社员编了个顺口溜说：“毛泽东思想闪金光，南大荒完全变了样：金黄色的稻子堆成山，黄澄澄的小麦盛满仓；穷庄子变成稻香村，盐碱地变成鱼米乡；家家吃的白米饭，人人穿的新衣裳。人民公社威力大，集体化道路真宽广；永远跟着毛主席，永远跟着共产党。”
    事实证明，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是吃人不吐骨头的豺狼，是贫下中农的死对头。我们一定要把革命的大批判搞得更好，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，痛打这条落水狗，彻底粉碎他复辟资本主义的大阴谋，永远沿着毛主席给我们指出的社会主义的光明大道奋勇前进！
