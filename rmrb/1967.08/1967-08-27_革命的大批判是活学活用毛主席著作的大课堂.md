In the surging tide of the revolutionary great criticism, the proletarian revolutionary factions must prioritize the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, transforming the battlefield of revolutionary criticism into a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

It is worth noting that in the current situation, within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary factions, some people still only enthusiastically rush about, charging and breaking through, and are unwilling to sit down and seriously study, working hard. This is a sign of impure proletarian revolutionary spirit. If this phenomenon is not given attention and corrected, it will not meet the requirements of the current revolutionary criticism, and will fall behind in the development of the struggle, becoming political mediocrities.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, each comrade might as well summarize and examine: In this great criticism and struggle, how much of Mao Zedong Thought have you studied? How much have you understood? How much have you applied? How much have you used Mao Zedong Thought to deeply analyze and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies? On this test paper of class struggle, how many points have you scored?

To master and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, is not an easy task. This requires diligent study and perseverance, the ability to think deeply, "to learn the method of analyzing things, to cultivate the habit of analysis." Only by working hard to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, using this sharpest weapon, seriously analyzing and researching, can one see through phenomena to the essence, draw clear lines, distinguish truth from falsehood. Only then can one thoroughly understand the content of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the handful of power-holders within the party in various fields, as well as its social, historical, and ideological roots, criticizing it deeply and thoroughly, and completely eliminating its poisonous influence.

### 革命的大批判是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂

    革命的大批判是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂
    在滚滚向前的革命大批判高潮中，无产阶级革命派必须把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，把革命大批判的战场变成活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    值得注意的是，在当前形势下，无产阶级革命派的队伍当中，有些人仍旧只热衷于东奔西走，冲冲闯闯，不愿意坐下来认真学习，埋头苦干。这是无产阶级革命性不纯的表现。对这种现象不重视，不纠正，就不能适应当前革命大批判的要求，就会在斗争形势的发展中掉队，变成政治上的庸人。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”根据毛主席的教导，每个同志不妨总结检查一下：在这场大批判、大斗争中，到底对毛泽东思想学习了多少？领会了多少？应用了多少？自己用毛泽东思想深刻分析批判了多少反革命修正主义谬论？在这场阶级大搏斗的试卷上已经获得了几分成绩？
    掌握和运用毛泽东思想，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透，批倒、批臭，并不是轻而易举的。这必须苦学苦钻，善于思索，“学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”只有下苦功夫学习和掌握毛泽东思想，运用起这个最锐利的武器，认真地分析研究，才能透过现象，认清本质，划清界限，辩明真伪。才能彻底弄清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在各个领域里推行的反革命修正主义路线的内容，及其产生的社会根源、历史根源和思想根源，把它批深、批透，彻底肃清其流毒。
