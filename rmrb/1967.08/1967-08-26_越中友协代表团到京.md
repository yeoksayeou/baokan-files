A delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Vice Chairman of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and Minister of Education of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Nguyen Van Huan and member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union Ho Quynh, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. The delegation was invited by the China-Vietnam Friendship Association to participate in the activities celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and to conduct a friendly visit.

The Vietnamese guests were warmly welcomed at the airport by the Director of the Foreign Affairs Commission Zhang Sirou, Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong, and member of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association Ding Xilin, as well as hundreds of revolutionary masses and Red Guards from the capital. As the Vietnamese guests stepped off the plane, the welcoming crowd repeatedly shouted, "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! U.S. imperialism will be defeated! Vietnam will be victorious! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, a representative of the capital's Red Guards presented the Vietnamese friends with copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges, and read Chairman Mao's teachings: "U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The Chinese people's struggle has proved this. The Vietnamese people's struggle is proving this." Vietnamese Ambassador to China Vu Minh Quan and embassy staff also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.
