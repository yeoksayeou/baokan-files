The people of the liberated areas in South Vietnam, under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front, have not only achieved great victories on the military front but also made tremendous strides on the production and cultural fronts. This has led to the expansion and consolidation of the liberated areas, presenting a thriving and prosperous scene and turning them into an indestructible revolutionary base for the people's war.

The broad masses of peasants in the liberated areas of South Vietnam have displayed a spirit of hard struggle, fighting while producing, overcoming the difficulties caused by the enemy's savage destruction and natural disasters, and achieving significant development in agricultural production. This has greatly improved the lives of the people, consolidated the liberated areas, and made a significant contribution to the anti-American national salvation war.

Over the past few years, various water conservancy projects have been constructed in the liberated areas. The Tam Ky region has a network of canals, and many other regions have built irrigation canals totaling thousands of kilometers, benefiting tens of thousands of hectares of rice fields. While actively constructing water conservancy projects, the peasants in the liberated areas have also promoted intercropping, relay cropping, interplanting, and other technical measures to increase production. As a result, the sowing area and yield of crops have significantly increased. Last year, the relay cropping area of rice in the Southwest and Central regions of the South expanded to 100,000 hectares, an increase of 34 times compared to 1965. The total grain output in the Southwest region of the South was nearly double that of the previous year. In the face of the enemy's continuous "sweeping," bombing, and chemical poisoning that destroyed crops, the liberated areas of Quang Nam Province still achieved the largest harvest in decades last year. The average yield of the August rice crop increased by 20% to 40% compared to previous years.

While striving to increase grain production, livestock, sideline, fishery, handicraft, and small-scale industries in the liberated areas of the South have also rapidly developed. The number of pigs raised in provinces such as Can Tho, Soc Trang, Dinh Tuong, and Tra Vinh last year increased by 260,000 compared to 1965. The number of pigs raised in the mountainous areas of Quang Nam Province last year doubled compared to 1965, and the number of poultry tripled. Over the past few years, many armament factories, printing plants, pharmaceutical factories, clothing factories, paper mills, and daily necessities factories have been established in the deep forests of the liberated areas, using local materials for production to support the frontline and meet the needs of the people's lives.

With the continuous development of production, the living standards of the people in the liberated areas have significantly improved compared to the period of enemy puppet rule, with two-thirds of the poor peasants now living at the middle peasant level.

The cultural and educational undertakings in the liberated areas of South Vietnam have also made significant progress. Over the past few years, the people in the liberated areas have, under the slogan of "where the liberation army liberates, there we establish schools," overcome the difficulties caused by the enemy and developed cultural and educational undertakings. New schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and many previously school-less villages now have their own schools. Every commune has a primary school, and many districts and provinces have junior middle schools and supplementary schools equivalent to middle school level. Currently, more than 90% of school-age children of the working people in the liberated areas have the opportunity to attend school. Literacy classes and cultural supplementary classes have been widely established in various places. Under the slogan of "those who can read teach those who cannot," the broad masses have shaken off illiteracy. In the past, many provinces had an illiteracy rate of 80%, but now these people can all read and write. The educational undertakings in the mountainous areas and the Western Highlands of ethnic minorities have also rapidly developed. Seventeen ethnic minorities have their own scripts and use their own ethnic scripts for teaching and publishing newspapers.

Schools in various places have vigorously implemented the policy of "education serving the anti-American national salvation cause," especially emphasizing patriotic education for students, continuously improving their class consciousness and political thought level. Students and teachers actively participate in the anti-American national salvation struggle and have received universal praise from the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A just cause enjoys abundant support. No enemy can crush it." The great achievements made by the military and people of the liberated areas in South Vietnam on the production and cultural fronts once again powerfully prove this brilliant truth.

    把解放区建设成为人民战争坚不可摧的革命根据地
    越南南方解放区欣欣向荣形势大好
    据新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南南方解放区人民在民族解放阵线的正确领导下，不仅在军事战线上取得了伟大胜利，而且在生产战线上、文教战线上也取得了巨大成就，使解放区日益扩大和巩固，呈现一派欣欣向荣的景象，成为人民战争的坚不可摧的革命根据地。
    越南南方解放区广大农民发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，边战斗、边生产，战胜敌人的疯狂破坏和自然灾害造成的困难，使农业生产获得很大发展，对改善人民生活、巩固解放区和支援抗美救国战争作出了巨大的贡献。
    几年来，解放区各地修建了大量的水利工程，同塔梅地区已渠道成网，许多地区也已建成了总长达上千公里的灌溉渠网，使成万公顷稻田受到效益。在积极兴修水利的同时，解放区农民还积极推行套种、复种、间作和其他增产技术措施，因此，农作物的播种面积和产量都显著增加。去年，南部西区和中区的水稻复种面积扩大到十万公顷，比一九六五年增加三十四倍，南部西区全区粮食产量比前年增加了近一倍。广南省解放区在敌人连续“扫荡”、轰炸和撒放化学毒药破坏庄稼的情况下，去年仍取得了几十年来最大的丰收，其中八月稻平均公顷产量就比过去增产百分之二十到百分之四十。
    在大力增产粮食的同时，南方解放区的牧、副、渔、手工业和小工业也迅速发展。芹苴、朔庄、迪石、茶荣等省去年养猪头数比一九六五年增加了二十六万头，广南省山区去年养猪头数比一九六五年增加一倍，家禽增加三倍。几年来，在解放区的深山密林中，还建立了许许多多的兵工厂、印刷厂、制药厂、军服厂、造纸厂、日用品厂等，就地取材进行生产，以支援前线和供应人民生活的需要。
    随着生产的日益发展，解放区人民的生活水平比敌伪统治时期大大提高，有三分之二的贫农已上升到中农生活水平。
    越南南方解放区的文教事业也有很大的发展。几年来，解放区人民在解放军解放哪里，就办学到哪里的口号下，千方百计地克服敌人造成的困难，发展文教事业。无论在平原或山区，新的学校犹如雨后春笋般地建立起来，许多过去没有学校的乡村，现在都已创办了学校。每个乡都有了小学，许多县、省都有了初级中学和相当于中学程度的补习学校。目前，解放区中百分之九十以上的适龄的劳动人民子弟已经获得上学的机会。民众识字班和文化补习班也在各地普遍开办起来，在“识字的教不识字的”口号下，广大群众已经摆脱了文盲状态，过去许多省的文盲占人口的百分之八十，现在这些人都已能读会写了。山区和西原少数民族地区的教育事业也迅速发展。有十七个少数民族有了自己的文字，并用自己民族的文字进行教学和出版报纸。
    各地学校在教学中大力贯彻“教育为抗美救国事业服务”的方针，特别重视对学生进行爱国主义教育，不断提高学生的阶级觉悟和政治思想水平。学生和教师们都积极参加抗美救国斗争，受到了群众的普遍赞扬。
    毛主席教导我们：“正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”越南南方解放区军民在生产战线上和文教战线上取得的巨大成就，再一次有力地证明了这一光辉的真理。
