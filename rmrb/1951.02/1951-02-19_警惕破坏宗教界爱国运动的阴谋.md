　　Beware of Conspiracies to Sabotage the Patriotic Movement in Religious Circles
    American imperialists and their running dogs are conducting activities to oppose the Chinese people and undermine the patriotic and innovative movement in Chinese religious circles. They have published a large number of reactionary pamphlets in Hong Kong that oppose the Chinese people, are anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and oppose the religious circles' patriotic innovation movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, which are secretly sent into mainland China for distribution. Among them, the reactionary pamphlet entitled "Learning Reference" is specifically promoting opposition to the patriotic innovation movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in religious circles. This kind of pamphlet has been discovered in Fuzhou, Changsha, and other places. Liu Hede, the deputy bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hubei, put forward the so-called slogan of "from the Apostles" to openly promote opposition to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Some elements in the Tianjin Catholic Church openly threatened patriotic Catholics, saying: "Those who sign the self-reliance and innovation declaration are traitors and are not allowed to enter the church." Certain upper-level figures in the Catholic and Christian churches in Chengdu are also engaging in activities to sabotage the innovation movement. Reactionary elements in the Tongyuanfang Catholic Church in Gaoling, Shaanxi, fabricated rumors, tampered with lyrics, and even changed the famous song "The East is Red," which praises the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, to "The East is Black." In the Xi'an office of the Christian Association, special work documents of American missionaries, "International Espionage Outline," and a generator and transmitter each and two pistols used for espionage activities were found. After the Government Administration Council announced measures to control American property, Bao Jinghua and Du Hua, two American priests at Hongguang Middle School, run by the Catholic Church in Nanjing, immediately stole and sold school furniture and utensils and slanderously defamed the Chinese people. The patriotic religious believers and the masses of the people in various places have expressed great indignation at these despicable acts of the imperialists and their running dogs to oppose the Chinese people and sabotage the religious innovation movement.
    Obviously, it is necessary to resolutely oppose all attempts to undermine the patriotic innovation movement in Chinese religious circles in order to safeguard the patriotic rights of the Chinese people themselves and to promote the patriotic innovation movement in religious circles.

　　警惕破坏宗教界爱国运动的阴谋
    美国帝国主义者及其走狗正在进行反对中国人民和破坏中国宗教界爱国革新运动的活动。他们在香港出版了大批反对中国人民、反苏、反共和反对宗教界自治、自养、自传的革新运动的反动小册子，送入中国内地加以秘密散发。其中名为《学习参考》的反动小册子，就是专门鼓吹反对宗教界的自治自养自传的爱国革新运动的。这种小册子在福州、长沙等地均已发现。湖北天主教教区副主教刘和德提出所谓“自宗徒”的口号，公开进行反对三自运动的宣传。天津天主教会中的有些分子公然威吓爱国的天主教徒说：“凡在自立革新宣言上签名者就是叛徒，不许进教堂。”成都天主教和基督教教会中的若干上层人物，也进行破坏革新运动的活动。陕西高陵通远坊天主堂中的反动分子制造谣言，篡改歌词，甚至将歌颂中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的名歌《东方红》改为《东方黑》。在基督教协同会西安办事处，已查出美籍教士所收藏的特务工作文件“国际间谍工作大纲”及用以进行特务活动的发电机、发报机各一部，手枪两枝。南京天主教会所办弘光中学美籍神父宝靖华、杜华两人在政务院公布管制美国财产措施后，即盗卖学校家具用物，并大肆诽谤中国人民。对于帝国主义者及其走狗所进行的这些反对中国人民和破坏宗教革新运动的卑鄙行为，各地爱国的宗教信徒和人民群众已经表示极大的愤慨。
    显然，必须坚决反对破坏中国宗教界爱国革新运动的一切企图，才能维护中国人民自身的爱国权利，才能把宗教界的爱国革新运动推向前进。
