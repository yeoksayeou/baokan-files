　　Forcibly Crossing the Imjin River
    Xu Jianmin
    The Imjin River, located 150 li north of Seoul, is a major tributary of the Han River. It is over 100 meters wide, and its banks are lined with winding, rugged cliffs and steep slopes, making it a natural defensive line from a military perspective.

    After the American invading forces, who narrowly escaped from the Yalu River, fled in a panic to the south bank of the Imjin River, they utilized the original "38th parallel" positions constructed by the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Day and night, they added layers of deep trenches, bunkers, barbed wire, and minefields to the mountain passes and open ground along the riverbanks, vainly attempting to use this natural barrier to block the advance of our Volunteer Army.

    In late November, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, braving severe cold and deep snow, advanced more than 400 li in five days from the Yalu River and occupied the north bank beachhead positions facing the enemy across the river. Fearing a breakthrough of this river defense, the enemy concentrated all the artillery in the area, along with twenty to thirty aircraft, and frantically bombarded the mountains and villages held by the Volunteer Army. The brave soldiers of a certain battalion of the Volunteer Army, guarding the riverbank, repelled countless enemy attempts to cross the river in ten days and nights. The second company of the battalion, holding the foremost mountain position, annihilated more than 100 enemy soldiers in three days and nights, yet our positions remained unshaken.

    To overcome the various difficulties that might be encountered in forcibly crossing the Imjin River, the main attacking force launched a mass "brainstorming" campaign. The unit immediately became a hive of activity. Everyone prepared straw sandals, "tightened shoelaces," measured the river's depth, and prepared straw bags to aid flotation. The cavalrymen polished their sabers to a gleaming shine. The artillerymen constructed fortifications on the frozen, iron-hard mountaintops. Reconnaissance soldiers waded through the icy river, searching for attack routes day and night, and even swam across the river to capture enemy sentries. Engineers continuously cleared the mines planted by the enemy on the roads of advance, and the commanders carefully selected the breakthrough points on the riverbank. Units assigned different tasks repeatedly conducted rehearsals in the face of the enemy.

    All preparations were complete. On New Year's Eve, the confident commanders and fighters chose this day, vowing to offer a new victory as a gift to the great New Year of 1951.

    The attack began. Five signal flares shot up from the mountaintops on the north bank. Immediately, the roar of countless artillery pieces shook the riverbank, and a massive volume of shells raged across the river. The bunkers painstakingly built by the enemy were blown apart, barbed wire flew into the sky, and dense black smoke shrouded the various mountain peaks on the opposite bank. Half an hour later, as the artillery fire extended into the enemy's deep positions, the assault companies began to forcibly cross the Imjin River.

    The assault team's attack route had to pass through the frozen river surface. Enemy shells created many holes of various sizes in the ice, and the brave soldiers, braving the enemy's dense rain of bullets, swiftly rushed across the riddled ice surface. Our heavy machine gunners, small cannon gunners, and automatic riflemen fiercely fired at the enemy's strongholds on the slippery ice river. Commanders ran in the foremost positions. A company commander, Xu Gengnan, was wounded at the breakthrough point, but he stubbornly persisted in commanding his company. The brave soldiers courageously passed through the enemy's minefields, climbed over the steep and slippery banks as if they had wings, and rushed to the opposite bank.

    Some assault teams waded across the river from the edges of both banks, where the ice had already formed, but the center was still a rapid current. The brave soldiers held their weapons high, and the icy river water soaked their chests, turning their cotton clothing into stiff blocks of ice. Their bodies were almost numb with cold, but the soldiers, with burning fighting will in their hearts, still bravely advanced. Countless assault soldiers who had crossed the river scrambled to climb up the three-zhang-high bank, vying with each other to be first. Assault platoon leader Wang Fengya led the brave soldiers to seize the enemy's beachhead position, which was fortified with eleven bunkers. The follow-up troops closely followed, launching a bayonet charge against the enemy.

    In just eight minutes, bright signal flares, marking the victorious breakthrough of the enemy's river defense, rose simultaneously from each breakthrough point with lightning speed. The sounds of gunfire on the riverbank and among the mountains had subsided. On the frozen ground, in the destroyed bunkers and communication trenches, lay many enemy corpses, lying horizontally and vertically. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. The "impregnable" Imjin River defense line, boasted by the American invading forces, was thus shattered.

    At dawn on New Year's Day, the attacking forces cleared the remaining enemy from positions more than 30 li south of the Imjin River and headed straight for Seoul.

　　强渡临津江
    徐建民
    在汉城以北一百五十华里的临津江，是汉江的巨大支流，江面宽达一百多公尺，两岸矗立着蜿蜒起伏的险峻的峭壁陡崖，在军事上是一条天然的防线。
    从鸭绿江边侥幸漏网的美国侵略军狼狈溃逃到临津江南岸以后，利用了李承晚伪军原在“三八”线上构筑的阵地，日夜在沿江的山头通道和江岸前沿的开阔地上，添设了层层深沟、地堡、铁丝网和地雷群，妄图凭借天险，挡住我志愿军的前进。
    十一月下旬，我国人民志愿军某部，从大同江冒严寒深雪，五天疾进四百余里，占领了与敌隔江相峙的北岸滩头阵地。敌人惧怕这条江防被突破，每天集中该地战场上所有的大炮与二、三十架飞机，向志愿军所据守的山头和村庄拚命轰击。守备在江岸上的志愿军某营勇士们，曾在十昼夜中击退了敌军无数次的渡江反扑，该营第二连坚守在最前哨的山头上，三昼夜即歼敌百余人，我军阵地却仍屹然不动。
    为了战胜强渡临津江可能遇到的各种困难，担任主攻的部队展开了群众性的“想办法”运动。部队里立即沸腾了。每个人都做好了草鞋、“紧鞋带”、测量河道的水标和帮助浮水的稻草袋。骑兵们把马刀擦得雪亮。炮兵们在冻得铁硬的山顶上构筑工事。侦察兵涉冰冷澈骨的江水，日夜找寻攻击道路，并且泅过江去捕捉敌人哨兵。工兵不断扫除敌人埋设在前进道路上的地雷，指挥员们在江岸上审慎地选择了突破点。担任不同任务的部队，反复进行了敌前演习。
    一切准备都停当了。大除夕，满怀信心的指战员们选定了这天，誓必以新的胜利作为给伟大的一九五一年新年的献礼。
    攻击开始了，北岸的山顶上飞出五颗讯号弹。立即，无数门大炮的吼叫声震撼了江岸，巨量的炮弹狂怒地掠过江面，敌人辛苦经营的地堡被炸翻了，铁丝网飞舞在天空，浓烈的黑烟笼罩在彼岸的各个山头。半点钟后，随着炮击延伸到敌阵纵深，突击连队即开始强渡临津江。
    突击队的攻击道路要通过结着冰的江面。敌人的炮弹落在冰上穿成了许多大小窟窿，勇士们冒着敌人密集的弹雨，敏捷地从洞穿的冰面上冲过去。我们的重机枪手、小炮炮手、自动枪手们在溜滑的冰河上向敌人的火力点猛烈射击。指挥员跑在最前面的位置，一位连长徐庚南在突破口负伤了，但他还顽强地坚持着指挥他的连队。勇士们勇猛地穿过敌人的地雷群，如虎生翼地爬过陡峭而溜滑的崖岸，冲上了对岸。
    有的突击队是从两岸的边沿已经结冰但中间仍是急流的江水中涉渡过去的。勇士们举着武器，冰冷刺骨的江水浸到胸口，棉衣结成了僵硬的冰块，混身几乎冻得麻木了，但是，胸中炽燃着火热的战斗意志的战士们，仍然生龙活虎地勇往直前。过了江的无数突击队员们个个争先地爬上三丈高的崖岸，突击排排长王凤亚率领勇士们首先抢占了筑有十一个地堡的敌人滩头阵地，后续部队紧紧跟上，对敌人展开白刃战。
    仅仅八分钟，各个突破口就神速地同时升起标志着胜利突破敌人江防的鲜明的讯号弹。江岸和山峦间的枪声已经沉寂了。在冰冻的地面上，在被击毁的地堡和交通沟里，横躺竖卧着敌人的许多尸体，残敌纷纷溃逃。美国侵略军所吹嘘的“坚如石墙”的临津江防线就这样被粉碎了。
    元旦的拂晓，攻击部队在临津江以南三十余里的阵地上扫清了残敌，直奔汉城。
