　　Should Grain Taxes be Reduced or Waived for Zhenjiaying?
　  Please Inspect, Wuqing County People's Government, Hebei Province
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I met a farmer from Zhenjiaying Village, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, who was in Beijing. We inadvertently discussed the situation of grain tax collection in rural areas. The following is his account: My family farms more than 40 mu of land and has 16 people. In 1949, our county suffered a major flood, and even the few mu of garden land in front of my house yielded almost nothing. At that time, we only hoped for a good harvest next year (1950); but last year our county was flooded again. In order to survive the famine, the farmers in our village planted several mu of rice near the village. However, the district authorities demanded that we pay the autumn grain tax, which everyone found very difficult, but in the end, it was still unavoidable.
    I hope that the higher authorities should investigate the situation in the disaster-stricken areas. If the disaster situation is indeed serious, the method of reduction or exemption should be implemented, so as to avoid the subjective grain collection or inaccurate reduction or exemption of grain taxes by some lower-level cadres.
                                       Reader  Song Lin
    Editor's Note: In some areas, the collection of agricultural taxes has indeed failed to strictly adhere to the tax rate and legally provide reductions and exemptions. Regarding the disaster situation in Zhenjiaying Village, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, as reflected by Comrade Song Lin, it is hoped that the Wuqing County People's Government will conduct an inspection. If the disaster situation is indeed serious, appropriate reductions and exemptions may be granted in accordance with the North China Region's reduction and exemption methods and the Hebei Provincial People's Government's regulations on reductions and exemptions. Please also inform this newspaper of the handling results.

### 甄家营应否减免公粮  请河北武清县人民政府检查

　　甄家营应否减免公粮
　  请河北武清县人民政府检查
    编辑同志：
    最近我见到一位从河北武清县甄家营村来京的农民，我们在无意中谈到农村中征收公粮的情形，下面就是他的谈话：我家种着四十多亩地，家中有十六个人。一九四九年我县遭大水淹了，连家门前种的几亩园地也没有什么收获。当时只盼来年（一九五○年）得个好年景；但去年我县又遭水淹了。为了度荒，我村各农户便都在村附近种了几亩稻子。可是区里却要我们缴纳秋季公粮，大家都感到十分困难，结果还是非缴不可。
    我希望上级机关应进行调查受灾地区的情况，如果灾情确实严重，应该执行减免办法，这样可以避免某些下级干部主观主义的征粮或不确切的减免应征之公粮。
                                       读者  宋林
    编者按：有些地区在征收农业税中，确未能严格依率计征和依法减免。宋林君反映的河北武清县甄家营村的灾情，希武清县人民政府作一检查，如果灾情确重，可按照华北区减免办法和河北省人民政府关于减免的规定予以适当减免，并请将处理结果函告本报。
