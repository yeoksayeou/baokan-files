　　The Increasingly Prosperous Baotou Market
　　Lan Yulin
　　Baotou City is a distribution center for industrial, agricultural, and pastoral products. Agricultural and pastoral products from areas such as the Hetao region, northern Shaanxi, and Ningxia (mainly including fur, grain, medicinal materials, etc.) are concentrated here for export; industrial products are transported in large quantities from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hebei, Shanxi, and the Northeast to be distributed to rural areas. The leading goods in the market are native products such as fur and grain, as the saying goes, "When fur moves, all industries prosper."
　　During the Anti-Japanese War, after the Japanese invaders occupied the city, the city's industry and commerce suffered great devastation. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries followed, with exorbitant taxes and levies, and the forced conscription of labor and grain, leading to the bankruptcy of the surrounding rural areas. Agricultural production decreased, the people's purchasing power declined, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas came to a standstill, leading to the decline of the city's industry and commerce. Before liberation, only about 700 industrial and commercial households remained, and most of them were barely managing to keep their businesses afloat.
　　After Baotou was liberated on October 23, 1948, the order of the market economy gradually recovered. First, industries were divided to overcome confusion. Subsequently, the government's commercial policies were publicized, and in conjunction with administrative management, a system for registering industrial and commercial enterprises was gradually established, as well as various state-owned specialized companies, banks, cooperatives, etc., to stabilize market finance and prices. By the end of May, order had largely been restored, and the main industries, such as fur, grain, and warehouses, had basically clarified their scope of business. At the same time, peddlers were organized, and new markets were opened, giving Baotou's industry and commerce a new look. Industrial and commercial operators praised the government, saying: "The People's Government has solutions and creates conditions for us to develop."
　　Like the rest of the country, the city, after the unified national financial and economic work in March of last year, curbed the inflation that had lasted for more than ten years and ushered in a new situation of stable prices. After the adjustment of industry and commerce in June, the serious difficulties temporarily encountered by industrialists and merchants were resolved, enabling the Baotou market to recover and develop in the hands of the people, and the blocked materials of more than ten years were opened up for sale. Through the government's call for mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and internal and external exchanges, and vigorously organizing the transportation and sale of native products, the native products that had been abandoned in the homes of farmers and herdsmen for more than ten years could be transported out in exchange for the cotton, cloth, and other industrial products they needed. The amount of material exchange in the past year has exceeded any year during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In terms of native products: the annual input of cashmere was 14,540,000 jin, grain 158,300,000 jin, medicinal materials 4,580,000 jin, hides 580,000 pieces, pig bristles 69,000 jin, and bones 130,000 jin; the output of cashmere was 18,970,000 jin (the reason why the output exceeded the input was that some of it was stock in the city), grain 89,170,000 jin, medicinal materials 3,610,000 jin, hides 400,000 pieces, pig bristles 66,000 jin, and bones 125,000 jin. In terms of industrial products: the annual input of white cloth was 160,000 bolts, colored cloth 130,000 bolts, native cloth 520,000 bolts, cotton 250,000 jin, cotton yarn 29,000 pieces, and matches 23,000 boxes; the output of white cloth was 120,000 bolts, colored cloth 70,000 bolts, native cloth 320,000 bolts, cotton 150,000 jin, cotton yarn 12,000 pieces, and matches 17,000 boxes. Most of the native products came from the Ulanqab League, Ih Ju League and the Houtao region, and were transported to Tianjin and Beijing; most of the industrial products came from Tianjin, Beijing, and other places, and were transported to the Ulanqab League, Ih Ju League and the Houtao region.
　　The result of smooth urban-rural material exchanges not only helped farmers and herdsmen sell their native products but also exchanged for the industrial products they needed. At the same time, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products gradually narrowed with the active exchange of materials. For example, in Baotou City in August 1949, one bolt of Wufu white cloth could be exchanged for 716.82 jin of wheat, one bolt of native cloth for 80.18 jin of wheat, and one box of matches for 1,090.91 jin of wheat; in June 1950, one bolt of Wufu cloth could only be exchanged for 448.56 jin of wheat, one bolt of native cloth for 53.54 jin of wheat, and one box of matches for 257.99 jin of wheat. In some areas of the Ih Ju League, the price of one bolt of white cloth has changed from thirteen dan of millet before liberation to five dan and two dou. This directly stimulated the farmers' production enthusiasm and relatively improved their purchasing power. Therefore, the number of farmers who changed into new clothes and laid new mats greatly increased.
　　In the past year, the number of industrial and commercial households in Baotou City has been gradually increasing due to the booming material exchanges between urban and rural areas. The actual increase in industrial and commercial enterprises throughout the year was 1,199, including 561 industrial households and 638 commercial households (at present, there are a total of 969 industrial households, 1,294 commercial households, and 2,457 peddlers in the city, totaling 4,720 industrial and commercial households). From the perspective of the nature of the increase, the industrial aspects are all industries related to the national economy and the people's livelihood (such as flour, dyeing, soy sauce, iron and wood, leather workshops, etc.), so sales are very smooth, and business is very developed. On the commercial side, most of them revolve around the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas (such as fur, warehouses, cotton cloth, etc.), as well as services for them, such as hotels, warehouses, etc., and the business is also developed and increasingly prosperous. At the same time, industrialists and merchants have organized their own organization—the Federation of Industry and Commerce. And successively launched the payment of tax arrears, held patriotic parades and other movements. In learning and practice, industrialists and merchants have realized that only by abiding by government decrees, reforming old business methods, facing the countryside, and making small profits but quick turnover can they have a future for development.
　　In this short period of more than a year, Baotou, which was devastated by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, has now become one of the hubs of material exchange in the Northwest region, playing its due role in the country's economic construction.

　　日趋繁荣的包头市场
    兰毓霖
    包头市是一个工、农、牧业产品的集散地。河套、陕北、宁夏等地的农牧业产品（主要是毛皮、粮食、药材等），集中到这里输出；工业产品则由津、京、沪、汉、穗、冀、晋以及东北等地大批地运到这里然后分散到各地农村去。市场上起带头作用的货物是毛皮、粮食等土产品，所谓“毛皮一动百业兴”。
    抗日期间日寇侵占该市后，市内工商业遭受到很大的摧残。一九四五年日寇投降，继之而来的是国民党反动派的统治，苛捐杂税，抓丁要粮，造成了周围农村的破产，农业生产减少，人民购买力降低，城乡物资交流停顿，因而市内工商业随之衰落。解放前，仅剩工商户七百家左右，而且大部分是勉强支撑门面。
    一九四八年十月二十三日包头解放后，市场经济秩序逐渐恢复，首先是划分行业，克服混乱现象。继之宣传人民政府的商业政策，结合行政管理，逐步建立了工商业登记制度，以及各国营专业公司、银行、合作社等稳定市场金融物价，到五月底，大体已有了秩序，皮毛、粮食、货栈等主要行业，已基本上划清了经营范围。同时，整理摊贩，开辟新市场，使包头市的工商业焕然一新。工商业者都称颂政府：“人民政府有办法，给我们创造了发展的条件。”
    该市和全国各地一样，经过去年三月份统一全国财经工作，制止了十余年来的通货膨胀，出现了物价稳定的新局面；又经过六月份的调整工商业，解决了工商业者暂时遇到的严重困难，使包头市场在人民的手中恢复和发展起来，十几年来滞塞的物资也从此打开了销路。经过人民政府号召城乡互助，内外交流，并大力组织土产品运销，使十几年来弃置在农、牧民家里的土产品都能运出换回自己所需要的棉花、布匹等工业产品。一年来的物资交流数量，已超过了日寇及国民党反动派统治时期的任何一年。土产品方面：全年输入绒毛一千四百五十四万斤、粮食一亿五千八百三十万斤、药材四百五十八万斤、皮张五十八万张、猪鬃六万九千斤、骨头十三万斤；输出绒毛一千八百九十七万斤（输出超过输入的原因是其中有市内的存货）、粮食八千九百十七万斤、药材三百六十一万斤、皮张四十万张、猪鬃六万六千斤、骨头十二万五千斤。工业品方面：全年输入白市布十六万匹、色市布十三万匹、土布五十二万匹、棉花二十五万斤、棉纱二万九千件、火柴二万三千箱；输出白市布十二万匹、色市布七万匹、土布三十二万匹、棉花十五万斤、棉纱一万二千件、火柴一万七千箱。土产大部来自乌、伊两盟及后套等地，输往津、京；工业品大部来自津、京等地，输往乌、伊两盟及后套等地。
    城乡物资交流畅通的结果，不但给农、牧民推销了土产品，而且换回了他们所需要的工业品。同时，工农业产品的剪刀差额也随着物资交流的活跃而逐渐缩小。如包头市一九四九年八月，五福白市布一匹换小麦七一六·八二斤、土布一匹换小麦八○·一八斤、火柴一箱换小麦一、○九○·九一斤；一九五○年六月，五福布一匹只换小麦四四八·五六斤，土布一匹换小麦五三·五四斤，火柴一箱换小麦二五七·九九斤。在伊盟有些地区，已由解放前十三石糜米换一匹白市布，改为五石二斗换一匹。直接地刺激了农民的生产情绪，相对地提高了农民的购买力。所以，农民们换新衣服、铺新席子的大大增多。
    一年来，包头市的工商业户数，在城乡物资交流畅旺下，已在逐渐地增加着。全年实际增加工商业一、一九九家，其中工业五六一户，商业六三八户（目前市内共有工业九六九户，商业一、二九四户，还有摊贩二、四五七户，总计共有工商业四、七二○户）。从增加的性质上看，工业方面，都是与国计民生有关的行业（如面粉、洗染、酱油、铁木、皮坊等），所以销路都很顺畅，营业也很发达。商业方面，大多是围绕着城乡物资交流（如毛皮、货栈、棉布等），以及为其服务的如旅店、栈房等，也是营业发达，日趋繁荣。同时工商业者已组织起了自己的组织——工商联合会。并先后发动缴清欠税，举行爱国游行等运动。工商业者在学习和实践中，认识到：只有遵照政府法令，改造旧的经营方式，面向农村，薄利多销，才有发展前途。
    在这短短一年多的过程中，被日寇及国民党匪帮摧残成破烂不堪的包头市，现在已变成了西北地区物资交流的枢纽之一，在国家经济建设中，发挥着它应起的作用。
