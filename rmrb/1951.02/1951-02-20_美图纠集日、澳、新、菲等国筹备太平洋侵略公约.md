　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, New York, 18th: From a report by New York Times reporter Hamilden, it can be concluded that the United States is stepping up preparations to conclude an aggressive Pacific Pact, to be attended by the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Japan.
　　The reporter said: The United States' plan to conclude such a treaty has been submitted by Dulles to some or perhaps all of the four relevant governments. Hamilden pointed out that it is an open secret that Dulles urged all countries to agree to unlimited arming of Japan, and that Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines are concerned that arming Japan may cause it to carry out new acts of aggression.
　　The reporter continued: The United States suggested that Japan be included in the Pacific Pact as an equal member after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, "the purpose of which is to eliminate these concerns."
　　Hamilden said: Although the Kuomintang group was not mentioned in the original US plan, there are now indications that the United States wants to use this group in the pact.

    筹备太平洋侵略公约
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：从纽约时报记者海米尔登的报道中可以得出这样的结论：美国正在加紧筹备缔结一个侵略性的太平洋公约，由美国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾和日本参加。
    该记者说：美国缔结这样一个公约的计划，已由杜勒斯提交某些或许所有的四个有关政府。海米尔登指出杜勒斯坚请各国同意无限制武装日本，并称澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾顾虑武装日本可能会使它进行新的侵略行动这一点，乃是公开的秘密。
    该记者继称：美国建议在签订对日和约后把日本纳入太平洋公约之内作为平等的一员，“其目的，即在于消除这些顾虑。”
    海米尔登说：在美国原来的计划里，虽然没有提起国民党集团，但现在有迹象显示美国想在这个公约里利用这个集团。
