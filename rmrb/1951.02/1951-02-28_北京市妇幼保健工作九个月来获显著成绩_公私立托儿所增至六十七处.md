　　Significant Achievements in Beijing's Maternal and Child Health Work Over Nine Months
　　Public and Private Nurseries Increase to Sixty-Seven

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Beijing's maternal and child health work has achieved significant results in the past nine months. The number of public and private nurseries in the city has increased from nine before liberation to sixty-seven. The Municipal Health Bureau has established a maternal and child health section specifically to lead the city's maternal and child health work. One additional maternal and child health center has been established, and the maternal and child health hospital has been strengthened, increasing the number of beds to seventy. All health centers have increased their maternal and child health staff; the four newly built health centers and one health station all have dedicated personnel responsible for maternal and child health work. The percentage of scientific deliveries has increased (in 1949, modern deliveries accounted for 58.2% of the total births, while last year it increased to 72.6%), and the work of health check-ups and home visits has also been strengthened. Due to the strengthening of scientific deliveries and prenatal and postnatal examinations, deaths from puerperal fever and postpartum diseases have been greatly reduced.

The Public Health Bureau has carried out the following tasks in developing maternal and child health work: In terms of organizing the masses, it has organized a maternal and child health work network with district health centers as the core; it has piloted a maternal and child health station in the Fourth District; and in the Fifth and Sixth Districts, maternal and child health groups have been established according to sections or street neighborhoods to carry out maternal and child health publicity and investigation work among the masses (the pilot results are very good). In terms of reforming old-style midwives, a total of 127 people have been trained from October 1949 to the end of last year. As for child health work, district health centers conduct regular health check-ups for children every week, established a nursery hygiene management group, and assisted the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Women's Federation in opening agricultural busy season nurseries in the western and southern suburbs of Beijing. Regarding factory maternal and child health work, the Public Health Bureau, the Municipal Women's Federation, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions formed a factory maternal and child health care and welfare group, and conducted pilot work with the People's Printing Factory, the Clothing Factory, and the Telecommunications Bureau as key points. In terms of publicity work, district health centers publicized scientific knowledge of maternal and child health to mothers; the Public Health Bureau held health exhibitions and often held small-scale mobile exhibitions in suburban areas and factories.

In order to consolidate and improve the work, the Public Health Bureau has decided to continue to promote scientific new methods of delivery this year, striving to reach 90% of the number of births; continue to train old-style "grannies"; and carry out health care work for scattered children.

　　北京市妇幼保健工作九个月来获显著成绩
  　公私立托儿所增至六十七处
    【本报讯】北京市妇幼保健工作，九个月来，获得了显著成绩。全市公私立托儿所，由解放前的九处增加到六十七处。市卫生局为领导全市妇幼保健工作，专设了妇幼保健科。增设妇幼保健所一处，充实了妇幼保健院，增设床位到七十张。各卫生所都增加了妇幼卫生工作人员；新建的四个卫生所和一个卫生站都有专人负责妇幼保健工作。科学接生的百分数增加了（一九四九年新法接生占出生总数的百分之五十八点二，而去年增加到七十二点六），健康检查和家庭访视的工作也加强了。由于科学接生和产前产后检查的加强，四六风和产褥病的死亡大为减少。
    公共卫生局在开展妇幼保健工作方面进行了下面几项工作：在组织群众方面，以区卫生所为中心，组织了妇幼保健工作网；在第四区试办了妇幼保健站；第五、六区按地段或街道胡同，成立了妇幼保健小组，向群众进行妇幼保健的宣传和调查工作（试办的成绩很好）。在改造旧式接生婆方面，自一九四九年十月到去年年底共训练了一百二十七人。至于儿童保健工作，各区卫生所每周定期作儿童健康检查，建立了托儿所卫生管理组，并协助民政局和市妇联在京市西郊、南郊开办了农忙托儿所。工厂妇幼卫生工作，公共卫生局与市妇联、市总工会组成工厂妇幼卫生保育福利小组，并以人民印刷厂、被服厂和电信局为重点，进行了试验工作。在宣传工作方面，各区卫生所向母亲们宣传了妇幼保健科学常识；公共卫生局举行了卫生展览，并经常到郊区和工厂举办小型巡回展览。
    为了巩固与提高工作，公共卫生局决定在今年继续推广科学的新法接生，争取达到出生数的百分之九十；继续训练旧式“姥姥”；开展散居儿童的保健工作。
