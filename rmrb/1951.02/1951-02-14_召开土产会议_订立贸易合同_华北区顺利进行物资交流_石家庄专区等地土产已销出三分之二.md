Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Large-scale inland material exchange work in the North China region is proceeding smoothly; Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei Province, Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province, and Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi Province have sold more than two-thirds of the total amount of local products in their respective regions.

　　Inland purchasing and sales are the basic characteristics of this material exchange in the North China region. Most of the industrial and agricultural products in various places are sold within a province, a prefecture, or even a county. The number of local products sold within Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province accounts for about 60% to 80% of the total sales. Those that cannot be sold within the province are transported to other provinces or other major administrative regions for sale. For example, the cooperatives of Chahar and Suiyuan once exchanged 6.85 million jin of surplus grain for 110,000 bolts of native cloth from Pingyuan and Hebei. From October last year to January this year, North China region cooperatives and East China and Northeast China signed six trade contracts with a total value of 221.238 billion yuan.

　　After successfully selling surplus cotton, surplus grain, and local products, the farmers' purchasing power for industrial products has significantly increased, and therefore the sales volume of industrial products in the inland areas has also increased. After 130,000 farmers in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province sold 135,000 jin of surplus grain and 1 billion yuan worth of local products, they immediately purchased 1.03 billion yuan worth of industrial products. Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province sold 9.42 million jin of 14 major local products out of a total of 11.65 million jin, and purchased 29 kinds of industrial products worth 240 million yuan. The Shanxi Provincial State-owned Trading Company's procurement volume of local products from October 1st to December 10th last year exceeded three times that of the same period of the previous year, and the sales volume of industrial products exceeded two and a half times.

　　Holding native product conferences (some places call them material exchange conferences) and signing trade contracts at or after the meetings are the two most important methods for the North China region to organize inland material exchange. The North China region has universally convened native product conferences at the provincial, prefectural, county, and even district and village levels, and has universally signed various large and small material exchange contracts at or after the meetings. As of January 19th, Beijing Municipality, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Pingyuan provinces, as well as 23 prefectures and 89 counties had held native product conferences. More than 1,300 trade contracts above the district level were signed through such conferences in Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province. The native product conferences are presided over by the People's Government, and widely absorb responsible cadres from relevant departments, state-owned specialized companies, cooperatives, banks, taxation, transportation and other aspects, as well as representatives of relevant private merchants and local product producers. Holding such conferences well not only initially clarified the local purchasing and sales situation, studied the material exchange routes before and now during the War of Resistance Against Japan, formulated sales plans, and dispelled the concerns of private merchants; but also turned these conferences into the best material exchange. After reporting the variety, quantity, quality, and price of the goods they need to sell or purchase at the meeting, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, or state-owned trading companies in this place and state-owned trading companies in that place, or cooperatives in this place and cooperatives in that place can trade in a certain commodity according to their own needs, and sign contracts on the spot, stipulating the number of purchases and sales, cargo specifications, and delivery dates, and fixing this transaction. Experiences in various places have proved that signing contracts has increased the planning of operations for all relevant parties, overcome the difficulty of a lack of cash caused by large-scale transactions between the two parties, dispelled concerns about suffering losses due to insufficient cargo specifications, and enhanced everyone's confidence in operating business.

　　In carrying out this inland material exchange work, state-owned trading companies in various parts of North China have universally adopted the method of purchasing from farmers on credit directly or through cooperatives, thus partially overcoming the difficulty of cash shortage and strengthening the planning of currency distribution and material allocation and supply. At the same time, this method enables farmers to sell agricultural products at reasonable prices in a timely manner and exchange for currency or needed industrial products on a regular basis, and has therefore been warmly welcomed by farmers.

　　In order to organize private merchants to purchase and sell industrial and agricultural products, various provinces in North China have appropriately adjusted the regional price differences of major items to make it profitable for private merchants. Representatives of private merchants are invited to participate in local product conferences in various places to help private merchants understand policies and market conditions. Some places also provide loans to private merchants in difficulty. State-owned trade organs, cooperatives, and people's governments in various places also provide assistance in various aspects to private merchants who engage in legitimate commercial activities in rural areas. All of these have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of private merchants in operating. In Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, about one-third of the local products are purchased by private merchants; in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, the number of purchases by private merchants accounts for about 22% of the total number of purchases; in Xingxian Prefecture, the number of purchases by private merchants reached 68% of the total sales of the three major products of grain, cotton, and hemp. According to statistics, except for cotton, which is mostly purchased by state-owned trading companies, private merchants account for more than half of the sales of other grains and local products in various places.

　　召开土产会议·订立贸易合同
　  华北区顺利进行物资交流       
    石家庄专区等地土产已销出三分之二
    【新华社十二日讯】华北区大规模的内地物资交流工作正顺利进行中；河北省的石家庄专区、平原省的安阳专区、山西省的长治专区已推销出各该地区土产总数的三分之二以上。
    内地购销是华北区这次物资交流的基本特点。各地所有工、农产品，大部分都在一省内、一专区内、甚至一县内售出。平原省安阳专区内销土产数约占总销出数的百分之六十到八十。省内销售不了的，便运到别省或其他大行政区销售。如察哈尔、绥远的合作社一次就以余粮六百八十五万斤换购平原、河北的十一万匹土布。去年十月到今年一月份，华北区合作社和华东、东北互订贸易合同六件，总值达二千二百一十二亿三千八百万元。
    顺利出售了余棉、余粮、土产品后的农民，对工业品的购买力已显著提高，因而工业品在内地的销售量也增加了。山西省武乡县十三万农民出售了十三万五千斤余粮和价值十亿元的土产品后，立即购进了十亿三千万元的工业品。平原省安阳专区销出十四种主要土产品一千一百六十五万斤中的九百四十二万斤，购进价值两亿四千万元的二十九种工业品。山西省国营贸易公司在去年十月一日至十二月十日的土产收购量超过前年同期的三倍，工业品的销售量超过二倍半。
    召开土产会议（有些地方叫物资交流会议），在会上或会后订立贸易合同，是华北区组织内地物资交流的最重要的两个方法。华北区曾普遍地召开了省、专区、县以至区、村的土产会议，并普遍地在会上或会后订立了各种大宗小宗的物资交流合同。至一月十九日止，就有北京市，河北、山西、察哈尔、平原四省和二十三个专区、八十九个县开过土产会议。平原省安阳专区经过这种会议订立的区以上的贸易合同达一千三百余件。土产会议由人民政府主持，广泛吸收本地各有关部门、国营专业公司、合作社、银行、税务、交通等方面负责干部及有关私商和土产生产者等的代表参加。开好了这种会议，就不仅初步弄清了当地购销真实情况，研究出抗日战争前及现在的物资交流路线，定出推销计划，解除了私商的顾虑；而且这种会议就变成了最好的物资交易所。在会上报告了自己需要出售或购买的货物的品种、数量、质量、价格后，国营贸易公司与合作社之间，或此地国营贸易公司与彼地国营贸易公司之间，或此地合作社与彼地合作社之间就可以根据自己的需要成交某种商品，并当场订立合同，规定购销数字、货物规格、交接日期，将这种成交固定下来。各地经验都证明，订立合同使各有关方面的经营增加了计划性，克服了双方进行大量交易所引起的缺乏现金的困难，解除了怕货物不够规格而吃亏的顾虑，增强了大家经营业务的信心。
    华北各地国营贸易公司在进行这一内地物资交流工作中，曾普遍采用直接或经过合作社向农民赊购的办法，因而部分克服了现金缺乏的困难，加强了货币投放和物资调拨供应的计划性。同时，这种办法又使农民能及时以合理价格售出农产品，定期换回货币或所需工业品，因而受到农民的热烈欢迎。
    华北各省为了组织私商购销工农产品，曾适当地调整了主要物品的地区差价，使私商有利可图。各地土产会议都吸收私商代表参加，帮助私商了解政策，了解行情。有些地方并对困难的私商贷款。各地国营贸易机关、合作社、人民政府对下乡进行正当商业活动的私商，又给以各方面的帮助。这些都大大鼓励了私商经营的积极性。平原省安阳专区土产由私商收购的约占总销出量的三分之一；山西省长治专区私商收购数约占总收购数百分之二十二；兴县专区粮、棉、麻三种主要产品销出总数中，私商购买数竟达到百分之六十八。据统计，各地除棉花大部由国营贸易公司收购外，其他粮食、土产销出数中，私商都占到一半以上。
