　　Must Continue to Carry Out Current Affairs Political Propaganda
    The Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country Movement is a nationwide anti-imperialist patriotic movement, and also a new ideological awakening movement of the Chinese people. Therefore, in this movement, it is necessary to continue to carry out current affairs political propaganda and greatly improve the ideological awareness of the broad masses of the people.
    Some people now believe that the Korean War has achieved great victories, the ideological problems among the people have been resolved, and there is no need for further propaganda. This view is obviously wrong. Although we have achieved great victories on the Korean battlefield, not all the people have a sufficient and clear understanding of the nature and significance of this victory, and some people still have some erroneous thoughts and confused ideas. For example, even now some people do not care much about the Korean War, thinking that it is a matter for Korea and has nothing to do with them; others still have illusions about the American aggressors and think that the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea can be abandoned halfway; and still others underestimate the significance of victory, failing to understand that this is a decisive defeat for the American imperialist aggressors, and doubt whether the Korean War will have twists and turns like the American landing at Incheon. These issues must be properly addressed so that the broad masses can reach a correct understanding of current events in a timely manner. On the other hand, although the U.S. military has suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, it still insists on its war of aggression against Korea, attempts to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan, is rearming the Japanese army, and is using the remaining forces of Chinese counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities. This still seriously threatens China's security and peace in the Far East. We must continue to systematically carry out current affairs propaganda, mobilize the broad masses of the people, and oppose new threats and aggression from the United States. We must recognize that the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs is a long-term and serious struggle. For more than a hundred years, imperialists colluded with landlords, compradors, and reactionaries to rule China. Although their privileges have now been deprived, the ideological and political poison they spread is still very deep, and they are still continuing to carry out deceptive propaganda. Therefore, it is necessary to wage a continuous struggle against them on the ideological and political front.
    According to the experience of various places, to do a good job in the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the following points must be noted:
    (1) It is necessary to grasp the new developments of the situation, major events related to the interests of the Chinese people, and important anti-imperialist patriotic measures of government agencies and people's organizations, and promptly put forward new and powerful propaganda slogans to mobilize and educate the people. For example, the new victories of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the Korean battlefield, the United States' refusal to negotiate peace, forcing its puppet countries to pass proposals in the United Nations that slander China, people from all walks of life signing patriotic covenants, opposing the United States rearming Japan, expressing gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and providing relief to Korean refugees, taking back the cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups that accepted U.S. subsidies to run them independently, as well as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the banning of the Yiguandao reactionary organization in some places, are all matters of concern to the masses. We should use these new and specific topics to carry out propaganda mobilization, call on people from all walks of life to express their opinions, and organize necessary activities. In this way, propaganda work will continuously align with the development of the actual struggle.
    (2) It is necessary to carry out propaganda and mobilization work based on the people's personal experiences and combined with their actual interests. For example, some factories in Northeast China mobilized veteran workers to recount the sufferings of workers during the puppet Manchukuo rule, explaining that they cannot be slaves and beasts of burden for the United States today; some rural areas in Central and South China explained the significance of Resisting America and Aiding Korea from the perspective of protecting the newly distributed fruits of land reform; industrial and commercial circles in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin held forums to talk about the situation in which American goods flooded the market after the Japanese surrender and before liberation, leading to the closure of industries and businesses and the economic depression of all trades, thus explaining that only by completely getting rid of the shackles and oppression of American imperialism can China's national industry and commerce have a way out; in addition, some women's organizations in cities convened forums for housewives, starting from the issue of prices, comparing the relatively stable family life today with the difficult and turbulent family life during the Kuomintang rule, thereby drawing the conclusion that the American aggressors must be defeated to defend the people's democratic new China. As long as we truly understand the lives of people from all walks of life, start with issues that are of personal interest to them, and use factual materials for comparison and explanation, we can stimulate the people's patriotism and achieve good results.
    (3) Propaganda must be carried out in conjunction with the people's various patriotic activities. We have launched extensive current affairs political propaganda in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, which has inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life and led them to engage in various patriotic activities; after their various patriotic activities have been launched, we should link them with their actual actions and continue to strengthen current affairs political propaganda to consolidate their patriotic enthusiasm and improve their political awareness. However, the leading organs in many places do not have enough understanding of this point. They often only pay attention to the propaganda and mobilization in the early stage, and when actual patriotic actions have already been generated among the people, current affairs political propaganda is invisibly relaxed. Taking the work of workers as an example, many factories have conducted preliminary current affairs political education at the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and then quickly turned to patriotic production competitions, guiding workers to bring their patriotic enthusiasm into their actual work, so as to bear fruit, which is correct. However, many factories at this time only pay attention to propaganda on the production side (which is very necessary), and completely abandon current affairs political education, not knowing how to use and improve the political awareness of workers through production competitions, as if production competitions are two completely unrelated things with Resist America, Aid Korea. In this way, the political significance of production competitions has gradually become blurred, and the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has also been restricted. This phenomenon also exists in the activities of people from other walks of life and should be overcome.
    (4) It is necessary to constantly understand and study the ideological trends of people from all walks of life, and carry out propaganda and explanation to address their doubts and concerns, and lead the masses to discuss and solve them. Never regard the thinking of a few advanced elements as the thinking of the general public, nor think that the ideological conditions of different masses are the same, or that the ideological doubts of some masses today are no different from those in the past. Different classes, occupations, and types of masses will have different ideological problems, and their ideological emotions are constantly changing with the development of the situation and the influence of various aspects. Even if some thoughts are essentially the same as those that have been discovered in the past, they will have different manifestations. Only by constantly dispelling various doubts in the minds of the people and overcoming all kinds of incorrect thoughts that affect the emotions of the people can the people's thoughts continue to advance. In carrying out this kind of propaganda and explanation work, we must be very patient. Except for those who are truly ill-intentioned, we must lead the masses to attack them, and do not arbitrarily label people with "hats," because arbitrarily accusing people is most likely to arouse resentment, which is useless and harmful to the work.

### 必须继续进行时事政治宣传

　　必须继续进行时事政治宣传
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动，是全民性的反帝爱国运动，也是中国人民新的思想觉醒运动。因此，在这个运动中，必须继续进行时事政治宣传，大大地提高广大人民群众的思想觉悟水平。
    现在有一部分人认为：朝鲜战争已经取得很大的胜利，人民群众中的思想问题已经解决，不需要再进行宣传，这种看法显然是错误的。尽管我们在朝鲜战场上取得了伟大的胜利，但并不是所有人民群众对于这一胜利的性质和意义都认识得很足够、很清楚了，并且有些人仍然存在若干错误思想和糊涂观念。比如，至今还有一些人对于朝鲜战争不很关心，认为这是朝鲜的事，与自己无关；也有些人对美国侵略者的幻想仍未肃清，认为抗美援朝的事业可以半途而废；更有一些人对胜利的意义估计不足，不了解这是美帝国主义侵略者的带决定性失败，并怀疑朝鲜战争是否还会有如美军登陆仁川那样的曲折。对于这些问题都必须予以适当的解答，使广大群众对于时事能够及时达到正确的认识。另一方面，美军虽在朝鲜遭受惨败，但它仍坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，妄图永远占领我国的领土台湾，正在重新武装日本军队，并利用中国反革命残余势力进行破坏活动，这就仍然严重地威胁着中国的安全和远东的和平。我们必须继续系统地进行时事宣传，动员广大人民，反对美国新的威胁和侵略。必须认识：反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争是一种长期的严重的斗争。帝国主义者勾结地主、买办、反动派统治中国有一百多年之久，现在他们的特权虽已被剥夺，但其思想政治的遗毒还很深，而且他们还在继续进行欺骗宣传。因此，必须一刻不停地跟他们进行思想政治战线上的斗争。
    根据各地的经验，要做好抗美援朝的宣传工作，必须注意下列几点：
    （一）必须把握时局的新的发展，与中国人民利益有关的重大事件，以及政府机关和人民团体的重要的反帝爱国措施，及时地提出新的有力的宣传口号，来动员和教育人民群众。例如，中朝人民军队在朝鲜战场的新胜利，美国拒绝和平谈判，强迫其仆从国家在联合国通过诬蔑中国的提案，各界人民订立爱国公约，反对美国重新武装日本，慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军及救济朝鲜难民，把接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体收回自办，以及若干地方的镇压反革命分子、取缔一贯道反动组织等，都是群众所关心的事情，我们就应该利用这些新的具体题目来进行宣传动员，号召各界人民发表自己的意见，并组织必要的活动。这样，宣传工作才会不断地与实际斗争的发展相配合。
    （二）必须根据群众的切身经验，并结合群众的实际利益，来进行宣传动员工作。例如，东北某些工厂发动老工人倾诉伪满统治时代工人的痛苦，说明今天不能再做美国的奴隶牛马；中南某些农村，从保卫新分得的土地改革的果实，来说明抗美援朝的意义；上海、天津等大城市工商界举行座谈，诉说日本投降后至解放以前时期内，美货充斥市场，以致工商倒闭，百业萧条的情形，因而说明只有彻底地解脱美国帝国主义的束缚和压迫，中国民族工商业才有出路；此外，某些城市的妇女团体召集家庭妇女座谈，从物价问题谈起，把今天家庭生活的比较安定和过去国民党统治时期家庭生活的艰难动荡作了对比，从而得出结论：必须打败美国侵略者，保卫人民民主新中国。只要我们真正了解各界人民群众的生活，从他们切身利害所关的问题着手展开宣传，并以事实材料进行对比和说明，是能激发群众的爱国心，得到良好的效果的。
    （三）必须与人民群众的各种爱国活动结合起来进行宣传。我们在抗美援朝运动中展开广泛的时事政治宣传，鼓动了各界人民群众的爱国热情，起来从事各种爱国活动；在他们的各种爱国活动展开后，就应该与他们的实际行动联系，继续加强时事政治宣传，以巩固他们的爱国热情和提高他们的政治觉悟。但许多地方的领导机关对于这一点是体会得不够的，往往只注意了前一时期的宣传动员，而在人民群众中已经产生了实际的爱国行动时，时事政治宣传就无形地松懈下来。以对工人群众的工作为例，许多工厂在抗美援朝运动开始时，都曾进行了初步的时事政治教育，接着就迅速地转入爱国主义生产竞赛，引导工人群众把爱国热情发挥到实际工作中，以便开花结果，这是正确的。但不少工厂到了这时就只注意生产方面的宣传（这种宣传是十分需要的），而把时事政治教育根本抛弃，不知道利用和通过生产竞赛，继续提高工人的政治觉悟，好像生产竞赛是与抗美援朝完全无关的两回事。这样，生产竞赛的政治意义既逐渐模糊，抗美援朝运动的发展也受到了限制。这种现象在其他各界人民群众的活动中也同样地存在，应当予以克服。
    （四）必须时刻了解和研究各界人民群众的思想动态，针对他们心中的疑问和顾虑，进行宣传解释，领导群众讨论解决。决不要把若干先进分子的思想，当作一般人民群众的思想，也不要以为不同的群众思想状况都是一样的，或者以为今天某些群众思想上的疑虑与过去毫无差别。不同的阶层、职业、类型的群众会有不同的思想问题，而且他们的思想情绪是在随着时局的发展和各方面的影响而不断地变化着的，即使某些思想在本质上与过去已经发现过的一样，但也会有不同的表现形态。只有不断地破除人民群众思想上的各种疑虑，克服影响人民群众情绪的形形色色的不正确思想，人民群众的思想才会不断地前进。在进行这种宣传解释工作时，必须十分耐心，除了对于那些真正别有用心的分子必须领导群众予以打击外，不要给人乱加“帽子”，因为随便加人罪名，最易激起反感，对于工作是无益而有害的。
