　　Overview of Agricultural Tax Collection Work in 1950
　　Li Chengrui
    The success of the 1950 agricultural tax collection work is a great victory on the financial and economic front. Now, except for individual remote provinces such as Guangxi and Yunnan, which started collecting taxes later and are still storing grain in large quantities, all other provinces have completed or exceeded their expected tasks. The total amount of public grain stored nationwide in 1950 will exceed that of 1949 by more than 600,000 tons (1.2 billion jin).
    The 1950 public grain collection work was characterized by four features:
    First, it resolutely implemented policies. In particular, in the newly liberated areas with a population of 250 million, the unified "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government was vigorously implemented, and taxes were levied according to the prescribed rates. This won the support of people from all walks of life, who praised: "Chairman Mao's method is good, both reasonable and fair." The old areas further implemented the proportional tax system, which stimulated the production enthusiasm of farmers. The success of cotton collection not only provided a large amount of textile raw materials, but also reduced the actual burden of cotton farmers by about 30 percent, which further increased farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting and promoted the development of cooperative work.
    The second feature is the combination of extensive propaganda work and the rising patriotism of farmers. All localities universally convened representative conferences of people from all walks of life and farmers' representative conferences during grain collection. Through summarizing production, evaluating merits and selecting models, and comparing and recalling the past, the farmers loved their government and their motherland even more. The farmers praised the work of the People's Government in 1950 as having "four goods: good at suppressing bandits and reducing rent, good at controlling floods and providing disaster relief, good at stabilizing prices, and good at purchasing local products." "Without the People's Government, there would be no good harvest this year." Therefore, many tenant farmers who had never paid land tax in the past began to pay grain to their government after rent reduction. Among the 250 million people in the new rural areas, about 150 million people paid grain in 1949; in 1950, on the basis of the initial improvement of farmers' lives, the number of taxpayers increased to about 220 million. The farmers said: "In the past, if we didn't pay grain, there was no bran at home; this year, if we pay grain, there is rice at home." The vast number of farmers understood from their personal experience in the past year who they were paying grain for. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, paying grain became the farmers' practical action to resist America and aid Korea. They automatically put forward the slogan "Dry and clean the grain and hand it over well, resist America and aid Korea to protect our homeland." The farmers in the old areas, who made the greatest contributions during the People's Revolutionary War, shouldered higher tax rates in 1950, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the people in the old areas.
    The third feature is the large-scale movement to survey fields and determine yields. All localities mobilized the masses to find more than 50 million mu of concealed fields. The authenticity of the yields was further improved. In particular, Zhejiang Province used the method of combining "investigation and determination of yields" from top to bottom and "combined evaluation" from bottom to top, which roughly fixed the yields in large areas in a relatively short period of time, which is a working method suitable for the vast new areas.
    The fourth feature is the combination of grain collection with party consolidation and rectification. All localities vigorously opposed "one viewpoint" (purely task-oriented viewpoint) and "four isms" (commandism, bureaucracy, departmentalism, and tailism), promoted democracy, conducted investigation and research, adhered to policies, relied on the masses, and suppressed special agents and illegal landlords who sabotaged grain collection.
    Of course, there were still some shortcomings and problems in the collection in 1950, mainly: (1) The acreage and yield of fields have not yet been fully verified. Some areas nominally implemented "tax calculation based on the rate," but because the acreage of fields has not been verified and the yields vary, the burden is still unreasonable; some old areas have different tax rates (the amount of burden per mu), and the masses reflect that "there is a number for the task, but there is no basis for the policy"; new areas have had deviations such as "fixed task, flexible tax rate" and "fixed task, fixed yield"; (2) Because there is no unified national method for disaster and deficiency reduction, it has not been completely possible to reduce or exempt taxes according to law. Some old areas have affected the balance of burdens because the estimated reduction or exemption is too narrow; (3) Most areas have lighter summer collection and heavier autumn collection, and individual areas (Henan) have heavier summer collection and lighter autumn collection, which has increased the difficulty for the masses to pay; (4) Insufficient attention has been paid to "collection business" and "technical details." Some areas simply wanted to be fast, and the grain was too wet. In some areas in the southwest, up to 80 percent of the grain in storage heated up. In the central and southern regions, 200 million jin of grain began to heat up. If it is not rescued in time, there is a risk of mildew; some areas have "ambushes" in rural areas and corruption and embezzlement by handlers; some areas' stipulated grain conversion rates and specifications are divorced from reality, and the masses are dissatisfied. In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings in future collection, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided that the new areas should combine land reform, issue land certificates, and vigorously investigate fields and determine yields; the old areas should seize the slack farming season to adjust the acreage and yield of fields. The agricultural tax law will also be revised by collecting opinions from all parties, so as to better implement policies and complete tasks for the 1951 agricultural tax.

　　一九五○年农业税征收工作概述
　　李成瑞
    一九五○年度农业税征收工作的成功，是财经战线上一个伟大胜利。现在除广西、云南等个别边远省份，因开征较晚，尚在大量入仓外，其余省份均已完成或超过预计任务。一九五○年度全国各地公粮入仓总额，将比一九四九年度超过六十万吨（十二亿斤）以上。
    一九五○年度公粮征收工作，贯穿着四个特点：
    第一，是坚决贯彻政策。尤其是在两亿五千万人口的新解放区，大力推行了中央人民政府政务院颁布的统一的“新解放区农业税暂行条例”，实行了依率计征，获得了各阶层人民的拥护，人人称赞：“毛主席的办法好，又合理又公道。”老区则进一步贯彻了比例税制，激励了农民的生产情绪。而征棉工作的成功，不仅大量供给了纺织原料，而且使棉农的实际负担，减轻了百分之三十左右，更加提高了农民植棉积极性，并推动了合作社工作的发展。
    第二个特点，是广泛的宣传工作与农民高涨的爱国主义相结合。各地征粮时普遍召开了各界代表会和农民代表会，农民们从总结生产，评功选模，对比回忆中更加热爱自己的政府，自己的祖国。农民们称赞一九五○年人民政府的工作有“四好：剿匪减租好，治水救灾好，物价稳定好，收购土产好。”“没有人民政府就没有今年的好收成”，因此，许多历来不纳田赋的佃户，在减租之后，开始向自己的政府交粮，新区农村的二亿五千万人口中，一九四九年约一亿五千万人纳粮；一九五○年在农民生活初步改善基础上，纳税人口增到二亿二千万左右。农民们说：“往年不纳粮，家中没有糠；今年纳了粮，家中有米粮。”广大农民从一年来的切身体验中懂得交粮为谁的道理。在抗美援朝运动展开之后，交粮成为农民抗美援朝的实际行动，他们自动提出“晒干扬净交好粮，抗美援朝保家乡”的口号。在人民革命战争时期贡献最大的老区农民，一九五○年担负了较高的税率，发扬了老区人民光荣的传统。
    第三个特点，是大规模的查田亩订产量运动。各地发动群众查出瞒田约在五千万亩以上。并把产量真实性提高了一步。特别是浙江省运用自上而下“调查定产”和自下而上“结合评议”相结合的方法，在较短时间内，把大块地区大体订好，是适合广大新区的工作方法。
    第四个特点，是征粮与整风整党相结合。各地大力反对了“一个观点”（单纯任务观点）“四个主义”（命令主义、官僚主义、本位主义、尾巴主义），发扬民主，调查研究，恪守政策，依靠群众，镇压了破坏征粮的特务和不法地主。
    当然，一九五○年的征收中还有若干缺点和问题，主要是：（一）田亩产量仍未全部查实，某些地区形式上实行了“依率计征”，因田亩尚未查实产量有高有低，负担仍不合理；有些老区的税率（每负担亩的负担量）高低不一，群众反映：“任务有数，政策没底”；新区发生了“死任务、活税率”、“死任务、死产量”等偏向；（二）由于没有全国统一的灾歉减免办法，尚未完全做到依法减免。有些老区因估计减免偏窄，影响了负担平衡；（三）大部地区夏征轻秋征重，个别地区（河南）夏征重秋征轻，增加了群众交纳的困难；（四）对“征收业务”和“技术小节”重视不够，有些地区单纯图快、谷子太湿，西南某些地区入仓后发热的达百分之八十，中南有二亿斤谷子开始发热，若不及时大力抢救，有霉坏危险；有些地区乡村有“打埋伏”和经手人的贪污中饱现象；有些地区规定的粮食折合率和规格脱离实际，群众不满。为了在今后的征收中有效地克服这些缺点，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会已决定：新区结合土地改革，发土地证，大力查田订产；老区抓紧农闲季节，调整田亩产量。并将收集各方意见修订农业税法，以争取一九五一年农业税更好地贯彻政策，完成任务。
