　　Lin Jie's Self-Criticism
　　Editor:
　　After reading the opinions of Comrade Wang Jinlin and others from the Central People's Supervisory Committee in the People's Daily on January 5th regarding the disciplinary action taken against me for violating policies and seeking profits while serving as the manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, I have further realized the seriousness of the mistakes I committed.
　　Entrusted by the people, I was responsible for leading the work of the Beijing Coal and Iron business. However, I was greedy for personal gain, violated policies, and caused undue losses to state property. When the Central People's Supervisory Committee began investigating my mistakes, I did not realize the seriousness of the errors and attempted to cover them up. After repeated assistance and education from the Central People's Supervisory Committee, I exposed my mistakes and gradually realized their seriousness.
　　I am determined to correct my mistakes in future practical work. I want to overcome the individualistic thoughts of hedonism and corruption, strengthen policy study and ideological training, and humbly accept the supervision and education of the masses, and strive to do a good job in the people's cause.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lin Jie

　　林洁的自我检讨
    编辑同志：
    读了一月五日人民日报王金林同志等对中央人民监察委员会给我在北京煤铁分公司经理任内违犯政策营利错误处分的意见，使我进一步认识了我所犯错误的严重性。
    我在人民委托下，负有领导北京煤铁工作业务的责任。但是，我却贪图私利，违犯政策，使国家财产受到不应有的损失。在中央人民监察委员会开始检查我的错误时，我还未认识到错误的严重性，并企图掩饰错误。经过中央人民监察委员会一再地对我进行帮助、教育，我才揭发自己的错误，并逐渐认识了错误的严重性。
    我决心在今后实际工作中，改正自己的错误。我要克服享乐腐化的个人主义思想，加强政策学习与思想锻炼，并且虚心接受群众的监督教育，努力把人民的事业作好。
                                                  林洁
