Earnestly Implement the Labor Insurance Regulations
-- Worker's Daily Editorial

The Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China have been officially promulgated! This is another great decree from our Central People's Government to protect the interests of the working class, following the promulgation of the Trade Union Law! This Labor Insurance Regulations uses national law as a guarantee to effectively resolve the difficulties and concerns of the vast number of workers and staff regarding birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability, which have always been the most painful aspects of their lives. Therefore, the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations is another great joyous event for the Chinese working class and a joyous event of great political significance for the people of the whole country. We express our warm congratulations and heartfelt support for the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations!

This Labor Insurance Regulations, like the Trade Union Law, is one of the major fruits of revolutionary victory won by the Chinese working class under the leadership of its own party - the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao - after a long period of heroic struggle. As early as 1922, the Labor Union Secretariat directly led by the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese workers in the struggle for labor legislation, and labor insurance was an important part of the labor legislation program. For nearly thirty years, countless martyrs of the Chinese working class have shed their blood and sacrificed themselves, one after another, to strive for the realization of this program, which the working class longed for. However, under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the answer we received was only bloody suppression and massacre. Only now, with the establishment of a new democratic regime led by the working class, has the labor insurance program that we have fought for for decades been realized. Our country's financial and economic situation has just begun to improve, various difficulties have not been completely overcome, and the People's Liberation War has not completely ended, but we are already implementing labor insurance. This proves that only our own country can care for and cherish us workers in this way. When we congratulate the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, we should thank our Central People's Government! Thank our working class's own party - the Chinese Communist Party! Thank our great and wise leader Chairman Mao!

We know that as early as 1949, the Northeast People's Government implemented the labor insurance system in major public enterprises. From April 1949 to March 1950, in the first year, public enterprises in Northeast China spent more than 5 million Northeast work points on various subsidies, relief funds, and pensions; by June 1950, a total of more than 14 million Northeast work points had been spent on the labor insurance fund. In addition to paying the workers and staff the various insurance benefits they were entitled to in accordance with the regulations, these funds were also used to establish collective labor insurance undertakings such as workers' and staff's sanatoriums, recuperation homes, convalescent homes, disability homes, and nurseries. More than 600,000 workers and staff in Northeast China enjoyed labor insurance benefits, and 1.5 million workers' and staff's family members also received labor insurance care. Ji Mitian, a coal miner from Hegang Coal Mine, had his left leg amputated due to a work-related injury and was admitted to a sanatorium according to the labor insurance regulations. When he talked about his life, he said, "When I was injured, I really didn't want to live. I thought that with only one leg, I couldn't even catch up with the door when begging for food. Who knew that the country would be so good to us, what to eat at what time, what clothes to change in what season, it's really better than home." Many elderly workers who received pensions believed, "Having labor insurance is better than having a son!" Many female workers, stroking the children sleeping in the nursery, often happily exclaimed, "Children are so happy! Thinking about when we were young..." This exclamation is easy to understand. Every Chinese worker knows very well that under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, not only were our workers' wages very low and their treatment very poor, but also with the continuous rise in prices, it was getting worse day by day, and the daily income could only buy one and a half meals; when encountering difficulties such as birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability, there was no way to solve them at all. Although some enterprises had some pension and retirement methods, they were actually a means of dividing the unity of the working class and paralyzing the workers. Therefore, they gave more to staff and less to workers; and for coal miners, who had the hardest lives and the most casualties, there was no such method at all. Moreover, the Kuomintang's pension methods at that time, like those in other capitalist countries, were based on the principle of commercial transaction: if a worker was crushed to death, you would be given a few dollars at a time; if an arm or a leg was broken, you would be given a few dollars at a time; and the workers' lives were not taken care of at all. They would be fired after a few days or a month or two of illness, sent out of the factory, and left to die or beg from door to door, unable to afford a coffin when they died, and their families would cry and kowtow to the managers and factory directors. A tragic saying circulated in the old society: "Factories only raise the young, not the old!" When we workers have the strength to work, they exploit your labor, and once you can't work anymore, or work less, they drive you out of the factory. Factories do not accept female workers with children. Han Yaqin, a female worker at Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7, worked for five years and was discharged and re-employed four times, giving birth to children and being kicked out; coming back after the children died. Let's think about how painful these sufferings of the workers were under the reactionary regime!

The so-called "labor insurance system" in capitalist countries is also completely a trick to deceive the working class. All or most of the labor insurance funds are paid by the workers, but the workers actually do not enjoy any labor insurance benefits. For example, in the United States from 1939 to 1946, 43 billion US dollars of insurance money was taken from the workers, but the actual insurance premiums paid to the workers were only more than 8 billion US dollars, and the remaining tens of billions of US dollars became the capital for banks to make profits. Another example is that the United Kingdom stipulates that people who have paid for retirement pensions for more than three years and have paid enough 50 times a year (once a week) are eligible to receive them. This is obviously a treatment for a very small number of higher-income workers, and the life sufferings of the broad masses of workers have not been resolved because of this.

Our Labor Insurance Regulations are truly a system to protect the interests of the working class, and are truly stipulated in accordance with the spirit of being responsible to the broad masses of workers. All the expenses of our labor insurance "shall be borne entirely by the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprises that implement labor insurance" (Article 7 of the Regulations), without requiring the workers to pay a penny. Moreover, the labor insurance fund and the labor insurance business are entirely managed and operated by the workers' own organization - the trade union, and our government is responsible for supervision to ensure the correct implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in their entirety. The Labor Insurance Regulations stipulate that for workers and staff's illnesses, not only are they responsible for treatment, but also pay wage subsidies and relief funds until they recover and are able to resume work. For workers and staff who are injured on the job, not only "all their treatment fees, medicine fees, hospitalization fees, meal fees during hospitalization, and medical transportation fees shall be borne by the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprise" (Article 12 of the Regulations), but also "wages shall be paid as usual during the medical treatment period" (ibid.). For workers and staff who are disabled due to work-related injuries and cannot work, pensions shall be paid until they die; for those who have lost part of their labor force but can still work, in addition to paying a certain disability subsidy, the administrative side or the capital side shall also assign them appropriate work. Workers and staff are old and have pensions or live in nursing homes. Upon death, the administrative side or the capital side shall pay funeral expenses and family support pensions. For heavy labor and labor harmful to health, such as coal mines and chemical industries, the working years for old-age care are shortened and the age for old-age care is advanced. There are special preferential treatments for the old-age care and childbirth issues of female workers and female staff. The Labor Insurance Regulations stipulate that female employees "shall be given 56 days of leave before and after childbirth. Wages shall be paid as usual during maternity leave" (Article 16 of the Regulations). In addition, there is also a certain amount of care for the illnesses and deaths of employees' family members. Our Labor Insurance Regulations also have special preferential treatment provisions for "labor models who have made special contributions to the enterprise and combat heroes who have transferred to work in the enterprise." This fully demonstrates our country's respect and love for labor models and meritorious people. Such a labor insurance regulation that takes into account the living requirements of workers is truly meticulous!

Our Central People's Government has already promulgated such good Labor Insurance Regulations for us. But to implement this regulation and run the labor insurance business well, and to seriously apply the various provisions in this regulation to "protect the health of employed laborers and reduce the special difficulties in their lives," is the responsibility that the management organs of various enterprises and the trade union organizations at all levels should assume. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots trade union organizations, must pay close attention and earnestly do a good job in preparing for the implementation of labor insurance. The administrative side and the capital side of various enterprises should also give all possible assistance and convenience. Implementing labor insurance is a decree promulgated by the state, and it is a major event related to the vital interests of millions of male and female employees across the country. Therefore, the administrative side and the capital side of various enterprises and the trade union organizations at all levels must treat this as a major task at present. To this end, the management personnel of various public and private enterprises and the cadres of trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen the study and research of the regulations, understand and grasp the basic spirit of the regulations, be familiar with each specific provision and implementation method of the regulations, and absorb the experience of the Northeast to enrich our necessary knowledge of labor insurance work.

Secondly, we must widely carry out publicity and mobilization work on the regulations, and explain the significance and role of labor insurance to all workers and staff, using a variety of methods and forms such as meetings, seminars, lectures, broadcasts, and wall newspapers, repeatedly and meticulously explaining each provision and method of the Labor Insurance Regulations, so that the vast number of workers and staff can understand the relationship between this system and their own vital interests, so that every worker and staff can care about and participate in the implementation of this regulation, help and supervise the correct implementation of the regulation, and check the results of its implementation.

Thirdly, labor insurance institutions of trade union organizations at all levels must be established and improved, and special attention should be paid to establishing and improving labor insurance committees in grassroots trade union organizations. All public and private enterprises that are to implement labor insurance should immediately check and rectify the factory and workshop trade union committees, and immediately start to establish labor insurance committees, establish labor insurance officers in trade union groups, and open training courses to train cadres to implement labor insurance. This series of organizational work will be the central link that determines whether labor insurance can be implemented smoothly.

Fourthly, grassroots trade union organizations must earnestly do a good job in preparing for registration, statistics, and accounting related to labor insurance, and register every matter related to the implementation of labor insurance for each employee very accurately and clearly. At the same time, they must make statistics on the births, old age, sicknesses, deaths, injuries, and disabilities of employees in their respective enterprises over a certain period, formulate labor insurance business plans, and formulate labor insurance expense budgets, so that employees can quickly and reasonably enjoy labor insurance benefits. When conducting registration work, grassroots trade union organizations must, on the one hand, combine it with publicity and mobilization work to provide detailed explanations to the masses of employees, so that the registration work can be done correctly; on the other hand, they must investigate and clear out those who have been deprived of political rights and should not enjoy labor insurance benefits, such as fugitive landlords, and officers and special agents in the Kuomintang army, police, and gendarmes who have committed counter-revolutionary crimes and have not repented, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of labor insurance work.

Finally, trade union organizations in various places should also patiently explain to the masses of employees in enterprises with less than 100 people: due to the country's economic conditions and the lack of experience in such major and complex work, labor insurance cannot be universally implemented in decentralized small enterprises for the time being. After a period of time, when production develops and social wealth increases, and at the same time, trade union organizations have experience in running labor insurance, then we can gradually seek the gradual promotion of labor insurance. Therefore, trade union organizations in enterprises with less than 100 people must not relax their concern for the labor insurance issues of employees because of this. Instead, they should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Labor Insurance Regulations and the actual situation of their enterprises, lead the masses of employees to conduct discussions, and discuss with the administrative side or the capital side of their enterprises, in line with the principle of "giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital," to seek appropriate solutions to labor insurance issues, and lay the foundation for the future full implementation of labor insurance.

Male and female workers and staff across the country! Trade union organizations at all levels and comrades engaged in trade union work across the country! Let us closely integrate the major task of running labor insurance well with the current struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, promote the spirit of patriotism, enhance the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters of the country, work hard, increase production, and struggle to consolidate the national defense of the motherland and to restore and develop the economic undertakings of the motherland!

　　切实执行劳动保险条例
　  ——工人日报社论
    中华人民共和国劳动保险条例正式公布了！这是我们的中央人民政府在工会法颁布以后，又一个保护工人阶级利益的伟大法令！这个劳动保险条例就是以国家法律作保障，来切实解决广大工人、职员生活中从来最感痛苦的生、老、病、死、伤、残的困难和顾虑。因此，劳动保险条例的颁布，又是中国工人阶级的一件最大的喜事，也是全国人民具有重大政治意义的一件喜事。我们特为劳动保险条例的颁布，表示热烈的庆祝与衷心的拥护！
    这个劳动保险条例，也与工会法一样，是中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，经过了长期的英勇斗争，所获得的重大的革命胜利果实之一。早在一九二二年，中国共产党直接领导的劳动组合书记部，就领导着中国工人进行劳动立法的斗争，而劳动保险就是劳动立法中的一条重要纲领。将近三十年来，中国工人阶级的无数先烈，曾经抛头颅、洒热血、前仆后继、奋不顾身，为实现工人阶级所理想的这一纲领而奋斗。但是，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治下，我们所得到的答复，只是血腥的镇压和屠杀。只有现在，建立了由工人阶级领导的新民主主义的政权，才实现了我们几十年来奋斗争取的劳动保险纲领。目前我们国家的财政经济状况，刚刚开始好转，各种困难还未完全克服，人民解放战争，尚未完全结束，就来举办劳动保险了，这就证明只有我们自己的国家，才能这样的关心和爱护我们工人。当我们祝贺劳动保险条例颁布的时候，应当感谢我们的中央人民政府！感谢我们工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党！感谢我们伟大英明的领袖毛主席！
    我们知道：还在一九四九年，东北人民政府就在各主要公营企业中，实行了劳动保险制度。从一九四九年四月到一九五○年三月，第一年中，东北各公营企业就支出了各项补助金、救济金、抚恤金五百多万东北工分；到一九五○年六月止，共支出了劳动保险总基金一千四百余万东北工分。除按照条例支付工人、职员应得的各项保险费外，还利用这些基金，举办了职工养老院、疗养院、休养院、残废院和保育院等等集体的劳动保险事业。全东北有六十多万职工，全部享受了劳动保险待遇，还有一百五十万职工家属，也得到了劳动保险的照顾。鹤岗煤矿刨煤工纪米田，因工受伤，左腿锯掉，按劳动保险条例，住到休养所里去了。当他谈起他的生活时说：“受伤的时候，真不想活了，我寻思只有一条腿，要饭吃也赶不上大门，谁知国家对我们这样好，到什么时候吃什么饭，到什么季节换什么衣裳，真是比家还强。”许多得到养老金的老年工人，认为：“有劳动保险比有儿子还好！”好多女工们，抚摸着睡在保育院里的孩子，常常高兴的感叹着：“孩子们真幸福啊！想想我们小的时候……”这种感叹是容易理解的。每一个中国工人，都很清楚地知道：在国民党反动政权的统治下，我们工人不但所得的工资很低，待遇很坏，而且在物价不断高涨的情况下，更是一天不如一天，每日所得只能换得一个半饱；遇到生、老、病、死、伤、残这一类的困难，就根本没有办法解决。某些企业虽曾有过一些抚恤、退休办法，但那实际上是分化工人阶级团结、麻痹工人的一种手段。所以，他们给职员的多，给工人的少；对生活最苦、伤亡最多的煤矿工人，根本没有任何这类办法。而且，国民党那时的抚恤办法，也和其他资本主义国家一样，本着商业买卖的原则：轧死一个工人，一次给你几个钱；断一个胳膊或一只腿，一次给你几个钱；根本不照顾工人的生活。病了几天或一两个月后就解雇，送出厂外，死活不管。工人发生疾病、伤残就无法生活，只好等死或沿门乞讨，死了买不起棺材，家属哭到经理厂长那里叩头求告。旧社会流传一句悲惨的话：“工厂养少不养老！”我们工人有气力干活的时候，他剥削你的劳动，一旦干不动了，或干得少了，就赶你出厂。工厂里不收容有孩子的女工，沈阳橡胶七厂女工韩雅琴做了五年工，曾四度出厂进厂，生了孩子滚蛋；孩子死了再来。我们想一想：工人们在反动政权统治下这些痛苦是多么难受啊！
    在资本主义国家里的所谓“劳动保险制度”，也完全是欺骗工人阶级的把戏。他们劳动保险的经费，全部或大部是工人缴纳的，但是工人实际上却享受不到什么劳动保险待遇，例如美国从一九三九年到一九四六年，从工人身上抽去了四十三万万美元的保险金，而实际支付给工人的保险费不过八万万多元，剩下那几十万万美元，都成了银行周转谋利的资金。再如英国规定，退休养老金不仅要缴过三年，而且要每年缴够五十次（每周一次）的人，才有资格领取。这显然是对于极少数收入较高的工人的待遇，广大工人群众的生活痛苦问题，绝未因此而得到解决。
    我们的劳动保险条例，真正是保护工人阶级利益的制度，是真正按照对广大工人群众负责的精神来规定的。我们劳动保险的各项费用，“全部由实行劳动保险的各企业行政方面或资方负担”（条例第七条），不要工人缴纳分文。而且，劳动保险金以及劳动保险的业务，完全由工人自己的组织——工会，负责管理与经营，并由我们的政府来负监督的责任，以保证劳动保险条例的全部正确实施。劳动保险条例规定：对于工人、职员的疾病，不但负责治疗，而且发给工资补助金和救济金，直到病好能恢复工作时为止。对于因工负伤的工人、职员，不但“其全部治疗费、药费、住院费、住院时的膳费与就医路费，均由企业行政方面或资方负担”（条例第十二条），而且“在医疗期间，工资照发”（同上）。对于因工负伤致成残废不能工作的工人和职员，发给恤金至老死为止；对于丧失部分劳动力尚能工作者，除发给一定的残废补助费外，还由行政方面或资方分配以适当的工作。工人、职员老了，有养老金或者住养老院。死亡时，由行政方面或资方发给丧葬费和供养亲属抚恤费。对于像煤矿、化学等重劳动和有害健康的劳动，更缩短养老的工龄和提早养老的年龄。对于女工人和女职员的养老和生育问题，更有特殊的优待。劳动保险条例规定女职工“产前产后共给假五十六日。产假期间工资照发”（条例第十六条）。此外，对于职工家属的疾病与死亡，也有一定的照顾。我们的劳动保险条例，对于“凡对本企业有特殊贡献的劳动模范、及转入本企业工作的战斗英雄”，还有特殊优异的待遇规定。这充分说明了我们国家对劳动模范和人民功臣的尊重与热爱。像这样体贴工人生活要求的劳动保险条例，真是无微不至啊！
    我们的中央人民政府，已经为我们颁布了这样好的劳动保险条例。但是要把这个条例贯彻实行，把劳动保险事业办好，认真运用这个条例中的各项规定，“保护雇佣劳动者的健康，减轻其生活中的特殊困难”，就是各企业管理机关与各级工会组织应该负起的责任了。因此，各级工会组织，尤其是工会基层组织，就必须切实注意，认真作好实施劳动保险的准备工作。各企业行政方面与资方，也应该给以一切可能的帮助和便利。实行劳动保险，是国家颁布的法令，是关系到我们全国几百万男女职工切身利益的大事，所以各企业行政方面与资方及各级工会组织，都要把这当做当前的一个重大任务来办。为此，各公私企业的管理人员，各级工会组织的干部，要加强关于条例的学习和研究，领会与掌握条例的基本精神，熟悉条例的每一具体规定及实施办法，并吸取东北的经验，来充实我们对劳动保险工作的必要的知识。
    其次，我们要广泛展开关于条例的宣传鼓动工作，向所有的工人和职员，采用大会、座谈会、讲演会、广播、墙报等多种多样的方法与形式，反复地，细致地解释劳动保险的意义和作用，解释劳动保险条例的每一项规定与办法，让广大工人、职员，都了解这个制度和自己的切身关系，使每个工人和职员，都关心和参加这一条例的实施，帮助与监督条例的正确执行，和检查其执行的结果。
    第三，必须建立与健全各级工会组织的劳动保险机构，尤其要注意建立与健全工会基层组织中的劳动保险委员会。凡是要实施劳动保险的各公、私企业，都应立即进行检查和整顿工厂与车间的工会委员会，并即着手建立劳动保险委员会，建立工会小组中的劳动保险干事，开办训练班，培养执行劳动保险的干部。这一系列的组织工作，将是决定劳动保险能否顺利实施的中心环节。
    第四，工会基层组织要切实作好有关劳动保险的登记、统计和会计的准备工作，把每个职工与实施劳动保险有关的事项，都登记的十分确实、清楚，同时对所属企业一定时期的职工生、老、病、死、伤、残，作出统计，制订劳动保险业务计划，拟定劳动保险费用的预算，才能使职工迅速合理地享受到劳动保险的待遇。工会基层组织在进行登记工作时，一方面要结合宣传鼓动工作，向职工群众进行详细的解释，才能使登记工作做得正确；另一方面，要把那些被剥夺了政治权利，不应享受劳动保险的分子，如逃亡地主，及作过反革命罪恶尚未悔过的国民党军队、警察、宪兵中的军官、特务分子，清查出来，才能保证劳动保险工作的顺利推行。
    最后，各地工会组织对于百人以下的企业，也应耐心的向职工群众解释：由于国家的经济条件，和对这种重大复杂工作缺乏经验的情况，因此暂时还不能在分散的小企业中，普遍实行劳动保险。过一时期以后，等到生产发展，社会财富增加了，同时，工会组织有了举办劳动保险的经验，那时，我们就可逐步求得劳动保险的逐渐推广了。因此，百人以下的企业中的工会组织，绝不能因此便放松了对职工劳动保险问题的关切。而应根据劳动保险条例第三条的规定和本企业的实际情况，领导职工群众，进行讨论，并与本企业行政方面或资方商讨，本着“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的原则，求得有关劳动保险问题的适当解决，和为将来全面实施劳动保险打下基础。
    全国男女工人职员们！全国各级工会组织和工会工作的同志们！让我们把办好劳动保险这一重大任务，与当前抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争紧密结合起来，发扬爱国主义的精神，提高工人阶级主人翁的责任感，努力劳动，增加生产，为巩固祖国的国防、为恢复与发展祖国的经济事业而斗争！
