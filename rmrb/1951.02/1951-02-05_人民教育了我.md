　　The People Educated Me
　　Tang Hanying
　　I grew up in Shanghai. I received a church school education. Before I came to Tsinghua, I studied at two church universities: one was Shanghai University, and the other was St. John's. At that time, I lived in a small circle, watching American movies, appreciating the literary works in the ivory tower; thinking that I could live my life very comfortably that way. I usually didn't read newspapers, let alone care about national affairs; when the Liberation War, which determined China's fate, was going on domestically, I didn't care about it either. Even after Shanghai's liberation, it didn't change me much. So when the Korean War broke out, and the Korean People's Army and the American invaders were fighting at China's doorstep, I didn't care. I still remember that I was interning at the Xinhua Bank in Shanghai at that time, and I saw the red flags of liberation on the Korean map at the bank entrance about to be planted all over North Korea every day, but I didn't feel it had anything to do with me. Because my pro-American thoughts at the time made me unable to open my eyes to see America. The enslaving education of church schools turned me into such a person. I had my own way of life at that time, and besides the material civilization of the United States, I can say that I didn't understand America at all, and I never thought that America was invading us. So when the American female teacher in the school said, "We American," I didn't find it jarring, because I was immersed in "We American" life at that time.

　　I came to Tsinghua this semester, and the environment has changed. I often went to see the big-character posters in front of the dining hall. Although I saw the conspiracy of American imperialism at that time, it didn't arouse my hatred for American imperialism. When current affairs learning started, I learned a lot of new knowledge; I listened to the students' analysis of American imperialism's economy, politics, and military, etc., which I didn't know at all before. I felt very ashamed and started to pay attention to newspapers, magazines, big-character posters, and blackboard newspapers. This made me have a preliminary understanding of the United States, and I saw clearly that American imperialism had been invading China all along. I knew what American imperialism meant by "America is a friend of China." It turned out that his sending airplanes and cannons to the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to kill the Chinese people was the expression of his "friendship"! However, my understanding at that time was still vague. For example, when I heard that our country was sending volunteers, I didn't dare to think about it. At that time, a classmate wanted to go home and cried to me. Although I didn't want to go home myself, I wanted to cry after hearing it. I said, "Don't cry anymore, if you cry again, I will want to go home too." Of course, I thought it was right to send volunteers at that time. However, I didn't have confidence in our own strength. I thought it was all over, and maybe there would be war tomorrow. And what about myself? Maybe I will be bombed to death. After sending volunteers, I studied some documents and listened to many current affairs reports, which made me know that America is not terrible and our strength is powerful. However, this was only a theoretical understanding, and I hadn't connected it with my own feelings.

　　The movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country began. Our Department of Economics went to several villages near Shijingshan to publicize. I said to the villagers, "We are resisting aggression, and American imperialism is invading others; our fighting against them is just and will definitely win." I also said, "We are not afraid of American airplanes and cannons. Didn't the People's Liberation Army only have very bad weapons at the beginning? But how did they defeat the Kuomintang? So we are not afraid of American imperialism, we can definitely defeat him!" These words may only leave a very shallow impression in the hearts of the villagers, but after I said them myself, I increased my confidence; a new and strong force was inspired from my heart. I connected the previous understanding of the United States with my own feelings, and I no longer considered the problem of whether I would be bombed to death, because even if I was bombed to death, the people of all China and the people of the world would never be bombed to death!

　　In Liuniangfu, I visited the family of a soldier. The head of the family went to become a People's Liberation Army soldier, and there were only an old lady and three children at home. The old lady was wearing a tattered coat, and one of the girls was dressed very thinly. A boy of fourteen or fifteen wanted to go to school very much, although the school didn't charge tuition, he couldn't go to school because his clothes and shoes were incomplete. I felt that they were too bitter at that time, and I felt very uncomfortable, but the old lady said: "Before liberation, we had no land. We couldn't even eat our fill when we were landlords' slaves. After liberation, the land reform was carried out, and we were divided into eight mu of land. I can eat now, and life is much better than before. I believe it will definitely be better than now in the future." She was so optimistic and not afraid of the immediate suffering. Her confidence strengthened my confidence. I had a further understanding of today's new society, and I was particularly hateful of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the aggression of American imperialism. I felt that my own feelings were melting together with the feelings of that old lady.

　　The old lady showed me her husband's letter from home. The letter said: "How are Shouren's grades in school? Why haven't you replied to me for several months? I miss you day and night." The old lady told me that she didn't have money to send a letter. I thought I should write a letter for her, because the soldiers fighting on the front line would be very anxious if they didn't receive letters from home. When I wrote, I transformed my own feelings into hers. In the letter, I wrote: "...I hope you fight well and liberate the whole country, eliminate the American aggressors, and you can go home. Everyone will live happily." I wrote this in the hope of combining my understanding of the United States with the old lady's hatred, and through this letter, infusing it into the combat spirit of the People's Liberation Army comrades, turning it into a real combat force, and giving the aggressor American imperialism a severe blow. This rural propaganda also educated myself, and made me move forward one step further.

　　Later, we rehearsed a living newspaper play, and I played Shen Chong, but I had no confidence in my performance. Because when the Shen Chong case happened, I only knew that a Chinese female student was raped by an American soldier on Chinese territory. I only hated the American soldier who raped Shen Chong, but I didn't think that there were thousands of American soldiers trampling on countless Chinese female compatriots on Chinese territory, and I didn't think that the Shen Chong case was a serious insult to China by American imperialism. So it is very difficult to play Shen Chong now. Later, after two weeks of current affairs study, I had planted some hatred for American imperialism, so I decided to cry out these hatreds. Later, we performed in the Yamenkou Administrative Village. The audience under the stage included People's Liberation Army soldiers, elementary school students, and many villagers. When it came to the part where I was grabbed by the American soldiers and dragged backstage, the People's Liberation Army soldiers under the stage were furious and shouted slogans "Drive away the American robbers," "Down with the warmonger Truman," and "Fight to Taiwan!" At this time, anger burned in my heart, and I just wanted to cry. I really cried, and I cried very sadly. I felt that I was indeed an insulted and injured person. I was not only Shen Chong, but also one of the thousands of Chinese people who were injured. I was no longer acting, I was accusing, accusing the oppression, rape and persecution suffered by our Chinese people from American imperialism. The more I thought about it, the more I hated it, and the more sadly I cried. The slogans of the People's Liberation Army soldiers under the stage made me feel that we were a family, we had a common enemy, a common hatred, and we were completely and tightly united together. Although I was crying at that time, I felt that I was becoming stronger. At that time, I had the real feelings of the Chinese people.

　　In this movement, I was not only propagandizing, but also educating myself. I deeply felt that if I was still confined to Jingzhai and the Tsinghua campus, without contact with the broad masses of the people, I would not have this kind of emotion now. It is impossible to have such a deep understanding and hatred of American imperialism, and it is also impossible to know that the Chinese people are so closely united together.

　　From then on, the cries of classmates wanting to go home—I hope there will be no such cries again—can no longer bother me. Now is no longer the time to consider returning from school to the family, but the time to consider how to temper myself, improve myself, and do my best to work in the movement to resist America, aid Korea. I want to always treat American imperialism with the kind of hateful feeling I had when playing Shen Chong.

　　人民教育了我
    唐涵英
    我生长在上海。我受的是教会学校的教育。在我来清华以前，我念过两个教会大学：一个是沪江；一个是圣约翰。那时我生活在一个小圈子里，看看美国电影，欣赏着象牙塔里的文艺作品；以为那样就可以很舒服的过自己的一生了。我平常不看报纸，更不想国家大事；当国内进行着决定中国命运的解放战争时，我也不关心。甚至在上海解放后，也没有使我有多大改变。所以当朝鲜战争爆发后，朝鲜人民军和美国侵略者在中国大门口打仗，我也不管。我还记得那时我在上海新华银行实习，我每天看见银行门口的朝鲜地图上解放的红旗快插遍全朝鲜了，我也没有觉得和我有什么关系。因为当时我对美国爱好的思想，使我没有能力睁开眼睛来看美国。教会学校的奴化教育，就把我变成了这样一个人。我那时有我自己的一套生活方式，除了美国的物质文明之外，可以说对美国是毫不了解的，根本就没想到美国是侵略我们的。所以当学校中的美国女教师说：“We American”时，我也并不觉得刺耳，因为我当时就是沉醉在“We American”的生活的。
    我是这学期来清华的，环境是改变了。饭厅前的大字报，我也常常去看。当时虽然看到了美帝的阴谋，却没有激起我对美帝的仇恨。时事学习开始了，我知道了许多新的知识；我听了同学们对于美帝的经济、政治及军事等的分析，这些在以前我是完全不知道的，自己觉得很惭愧，就开始注意看报纸、杂志、大字报和黑板报。这使我开始对美国有了初步的认识，我看清了美帝是一直在侵略我们中国的。我知道了美帝所谓“美国是中国的朋友”，是怎么回事，原来他把飞机大炮送给日本鬼子和蒋匪帮来杀害中国人民，就是他的“友情”的表现！不过我那时的认识还是模糊的。例如，当我听到我国出志愿兵时，我简直不敢往下想了。当时有个同学想回家，对我哭了，我自己虽然不想回家，可是，我听了也想哭。我说：“你别再哭了，你再哭，我也要想回家了。”当然啰，我那时觉得出志愿兵是对的。但是，我对我们自己的力量没有信心。我想这下算完了，明天也许就要战争了。而我自己呢？也许就会被炸死了。在出志愿兵以后，我又学习了些文件。又听了许多时事报告，使我知道了美国是不可怕的，我们的力量是强大的。可是，这只是理论上的认识，却还没有把它和自己的感情连系起来。
    抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动开始了。我们经济系到石景山附近的几个乡村中去宣传。我对老乡们说：“我们是抵抗侵略，美帝是侵略人家；我们打他们是正义的，一定会胜利。”还说：“我们不怕美国的飞机大炮，你看解放军当初不是只有很坏的武器吗？可又怎么把国民党打垮的？所以我们不怕美帝，我们一定可以把他打垮！”这些话在老乡们的心中也许只留下一个很浅薄的印象，但是我自己讲后却增加了信心；一股新的坚强的力量从我的内心中激发出来了。我把以前学习到对美国的认识和自己的感情连起来了，我不再考虑到自己炸死不炸死的问题，因为，即使得自己被炸死，全中国的人民，全世界的人民却永远是炸不完的！
    在刘娘府，我访问过一个军属的家庭。当家的去当解放军了，家里只有一个大娘和三个小孩子。那位大娘穿着一件破衣裳，一个女孩穿得很单薄。一个十四五岁的男孩子很想去上学，虽然学校不要学费，可是因为衣鞋不全，便不能去念书了。我当时觉得他们实在太苦了，我很难受，可是大娘却说：“解放以前，我们是没有地的。给地主当牛马也吃不饱肚子。解放后，土改了，分得了八亩地，我可以吃饭了，生活比以前好多了，我相信将来一定比现在更好。”她这样子乐观，不怕眼前的苦。她的信心加强了我的信心。我对今天的新社会有了进一步的认识，而对国民党反动统治及美帝的侵略就特别憎恨。我觉得我自己的感情是和那位大娘的感情融化在一起了。
    大娘给我看她丈夫的家信。信上说：“守仁念书的成绩怎么样？为什么整几个月不给我回信？使我日夜思念。”大娘告诉我她没有钱寄信，我想我应该为她写信，因为在前方作战的战士收不到家信一定会很着急的。我写的时候，就把自己的感情转化在她的身上，我在信中写道：“……希望你好好的打仗，待把全国解放了，把美国侵略军消灭了，你就可以回家。大家快快活活的过日子了。”我这样写是希望把我对美国的认识和大娘的仇恨结合起来，通过这封信，贯注到解放军同志们的作战精神上去，化为真正的战斗力量，给侵略者美帝以严重的打击。通过这次农村宣传，也教育了我自己，使我又前进了一步。
    后来我们排了一个活报剧，我演沈崇，但是对自己的表演没有信心。因为在沈崇案发生的时候，我只知道有一个中国女学生在中国领土上被美国奸污。我只痛恨那奸污沈崇的美国兵，却没想到还有千万个美国兵在中国领土上蹂躏了无数中国女同胞，也没有想到沈崇案是美帝对中国的怎样一种严重的侮辱。所以现在要演沈崇很困难。后来经过了两个星期的时事学习，我对美帝已种下了一些仇恨，我就决心把这些仇恨哭出来。后来在衙门口行政村演出，台下的观众，有解放军、小学生和许多老乡。当演到我被美军攫住，拖向后台时，台下的解放军怒不可遏，纷纷高呼口号“打走美国强盗”、“打倒杜鲁门战争贩子”、“打到台湾去”！这时我心中燃烧起了愤怒，就是想哭，我真的哭出来了，而且哭得很悲惨。我觉得我的确是一个被侮辱的与被损害的，我不仅是沈崇，而且是千百万个被损害的中国老百姓中的一个。我不再是演戏了，我是在控诉，控诉我们中国人民所受到的美帝的压迫，奸污和迫害，我越想越恨就越哭得凄惨。台下解放军的口号使我觉得我们是一家人，我们有共同的敌人，共同的愤恨，我们是已经完全紧紧的团结在一起了。我那时虽然在哭，但是我觉得我是坚强起来了，我那时有了真正的中国人民的感情。
    在这次运动中，我不单是在宣传，而且也教育了我自己、我深深的感觉到，如果我还是关在静斋，关在清华园，不接触到广大的人民群众，我就不可能有现在这一种感情。不可能对美帝有这样深切的认识和仇恨，也不可能知道中国人民是这样紧密的团结在一起。
    从此以后，同学要回家的哭声——我希望再也没有那样的哭声——是再也不能引起我的烦恼了。现在已经不是考虑由学校回到家庭中去的时候，而是考虑怎样在抗美援朝的运动中，锻炼自己，提高自己，尽自己的力量去工作的时候。我要永远把演沈崇时那种愤恨的感情来对待美帝国主义。
