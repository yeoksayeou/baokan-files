Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: The passage of the U.S. slander case against our country has not changed its isolated position. This fact can be proven by the stillborn nature of the established mediation committee. This committee is an ornament in the U.S. plan to whitewash its bloody aggression crimes, stipulating that it should be composed of the President of the United Nations General Assembly and two people designated by him. Due to the intense condemnation of the U.S.'s unreasonable slander case by world public opinion, this committee has not been established until now. Immediately after the United Nations General Assembly passed the U.S. slander case on February 1st, the President of the General Assembly, Entezam, stated that he would nominate Indian representative Rau and Canadian representative Pearson as members of this so-called mediation committee. However, Rau immediately stated that he was determined not to participate in the work of this committee. Pearson also expressed hesitation. Subsequently, Entezam still issued a formal invitation, but the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Indian Prime Minister Nehru successively declared on the 3rd and 4th that India had decided not to participate in this so-called mediation committee. Rau formally notified Entezam of the Indian government's decision on the 5th. On the same day, Pearson also expressed his unwillingness to work on this committee.

　　联大“斡旋委员会”难产
    印、加两国代表都拒绝参加
    【新华社八日讯】美国对我国诽谤案的通过并没有改变它的孤立地位，这个事实从所设斡旋委员会的难产可以证明。这个委员会是美国计划中的粉饰血腥侵略罪行的装饰品，规定应由联合国大会主席和他指定的两人共同组成。由于全世界舆论对美国无理诽谤案的剧烈指责，这个委员会一直到现在还成立不起来。紧接着联合国大会于二月一日通过美国诽谤案之后，大会主席安迪让即表示他将提名印度代表劳氏和加拿大代表皮尔逊为这个所谓斡旋委员会的委员。但是劳氏立即表示他决心不参加这个委员会的工作。皮尔逊也表示犹豫。其后，安迪让仍然发出了正式的邀请，但是印度外交部发言人和印度总理尼赫鲁先后于三、四两日声明印度决定不参加这个所谓斡旋委员会。劳氏并于五日将印度政府的决定正式通知安迪让。同日，皮尔逊亦表示不愿意在这个委员会内工作。
