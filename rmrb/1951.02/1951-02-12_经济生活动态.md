　　　　Nearly Two Thousand Labor-Management Collective Contracts Signed Nationwide Last Year
　　As of November last year, a total of 701 collective contracts were signed in 36 cities in the Northeast, and 1,276 contracts were signed in 96 cities within the passes (Guannei). The content of the contracts signed in the first half of the year generally focused on wage待遇, mutual rights and obligations, and factory and shop specifications; the second half of the year focused on regulations on production, operation, management, personnel, labor-management consultation meeting organization regulations, and labor discipline, etc., indicating a focus on business improvement. In the second half of the year, with the regular inspection of labor-management consultation meetings, the implementation of collective contracts has made great progress.
　　　　Shandong Province Effectively Organizes and Utilizes Waterwheels
　　Shandong Province produced a total of 24,169 waterwheels last year, of which 15,783 have been loaned out. Because the province organized the use of waterwheels, its role is greater than that of the North China region. On average, each waterwheel irrigates 15 mu of land, with an average increase in grain production of 80 to 100 jin per mu.

            去年全国签订劳资集体合同近两千份
    全国各地劳资合同的签订，截至去年十一月止，东北三十六个城市共签订集体合同七百零一份，关内九十六个城市共签订合同一千二百七十六份。上半年签订的合同内容，一般都偏重于工资待遇、双方权利义务及厂铺规格等方面；下半年却是以规定生产、经营、管理、人事、劳资协商会议组织条例及劳动纪律等为主，可见已着重于业务的改进方面。下半年更因有劳资协商会议的经常检查，使集体合同的贯彻执行，有了很大的进步。
