　　Model Grain Depot of Chahar Province
    Liu Dachang
    The grain depot in Chicheng County, Chahar Province, is a model grain depot in the province. According to the regulations of the Central People's Government, the annual grain loss rate for grain depots is 1.5%. However, the annual loss rate for all grain depots in Chicheng County is only 0.1%.
    The county has a total of ten large and small grain depots, distributed in several villages and towns hundreds of miles apart. Six of these grain depots are managed by village cadres in the respective villages. All the warehouses are renovated from old houses or ancestral halls and temples, and the equipment is quite rudimentary. Any slight negligence can lead to losses.
    Chicheng County's ability to store grain well is inseparable from the efforts of Guo Yuanpei, the director of the grain depot. Guo Yuanpei's working "secret" is: relying on the masses, uniting cadres, being prudent and diligent.
    The central grain depot where Guo Yuanpei is located has a total of seven cadres. Under his leadership, a strict work and study system has been established. They seriously study business and summarize experience at the weekly work research meetings and monthly warehouse meetings. This ensures that each cadre is meticulously responsible for their work.
    In April of last year, to prevent grain from rotting, the seven cadres turned over 250,000 jin of grain in ten days. During the rainy season, they often fought rain all night long, covering the roof with mats and checking the walls of the warehouse. One night, an old cellar at the base of the warehouse wall collapsed and water poured in. They immediately dug ditches overnight to divert the water and protect the grain depot from water damage.
    Guo Yuanpei diligently inspects the branch grain depots. Last year, he inspected the branch depots fifteen times.
    Guo Yuanpei knows that it is difficult to protect the grain depot by relying solely on the strength of the grain depot cadres themselves. He often explains the importance of warehouse protection to the rural cadres and masses in the villages where the grain depots are located. Therefore, the young and strong men and militia of these villages and towns take warehouse protection work seriously. They are divided into patrol, intelligence, and fire-fighting teams. The militia can patrol regularly. The fire-fighting team is equipped with fire-fighting equipment such as buckets and ladders, and certain personnel are always responsible for it. Each grain depot holds neighborhood forums every month to solicit opinions from the masses and educate them on warehouse protection. Because the grain depots scattered in various villages and towns can get help and supervision from the masses, the stored grain can be turned over and dried on time, avoiding various losses.

　　察哈尔省的模范粮库
    刘大昌
    察哈尔省赤城县的粮库，是该省的模范粮库。按中央人民政府的规定，粮库的粮食全年损耗率是百分之一点五。而赤城县的全部粮库全年的损耗率只有千分之一。
    该县一共有大小十个粮库，分布在互隔百把里路的几个村镇。其中有六个粮库是委托所在村的村干部代管的。所有库房都是旧有民房或祠堂庙宇改修的，设备相当简陋，稍有疏忽，就会遭受损失。
    赤城县能把粮食保管得好，是和粮库主任郭元培的努力分不开的。郭元培的工作“秘诀”是：依靠群众，团结干部，谨慎勤劳。
    郭元培所在的中心粮库共七个干部，在他的领导下建立了严格的工作、学习制度。他们在每周一次的工作研究会及每月一次的库务会议上，都能认真地研究业务，总结经验。使每个干部都精心负责地进行工作。
    去年四月，为防止库粮霉烂，他们七个干部，在十天内即倒翻了二十五万斤粮食。在雨季，他们经常整夜和雨水搏斗。用席子覆盖房顶，查看库房的墙壁。有一夜，库房墙根有一个旧窖陷塌，被灌进水，他们即连夜挖沟，引水外流，保护了粮库未受水害。
    对各分粮库，郭元培勤于进行检查。去年一年中，曾到各分库检查过十五次。
    郭元培知道，只靠粮库干部本身的力量，是难以把粮库保护好的。他经常向粮库所在地的乡村干部和群众讲解护仓的重要。因而这些村、镇的青壮年、民兵，都认真地进行护仓工作。他们分为巡逻、情报、消防三组。民兵都能经常进行巡逻。消防组并备有水桶、梯子等防火用具，平时总有一定的人员负责。各粮库每月都要召开四邻座谈会，征求群众意见，向他们进行护仓教育。由于分散在各村、镇的粮库能够获得群众的帮助和监督，使存粮能按时翻晒，避免了各种损失。
