　　Editor's Note: After receiving a letter from reader Zhang Peng, this newspaper dispatched a reporter to Nanshijiabao Village, Zhengding County, to conduct an investigation. The reporter's investigation was largely consistent with the facts stated in Zhang Peng's letter. However, the primary responsibility for this error of unprincipled leniency towards reactionary elements lies with the Zhengding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, not with the Sixth District Committee.
　　The incident occurred on August 9th of last year. When Zhao Bei, the militia platoon leader of Nanshijiabao Village, discovered that reactionary landlords and rich peasants Zhang Baoqi, Dong Qingxiang, and others were plotting to murder cadres, he led the militia to tie up Dong Qingxiang and take him to the platoon headquarters, and Zhang Baoqi to another location for separate questioning. Dong Qingxiang's account was completely consistent with the information reported by Zhang Nianzi. During the questioning, Zhao Bei poked Zhang Baoqi four times with the butt of a rifle. The next day, Zhao Bei and Hua Zi (a militiaman) went to the District Committee to ask for instructions on how to handle the matter. Upon hearing the report of this incident, Zhen Diffei, the District Committee Secretary, immediately turned pale with fright and hurriedly inquired about the details. However, Zhen Diffei's questions were not about the activities of the reactionary landlords and rich peasants, but rather focused on: "You must have tortured them, otherwise how could you have gotten these confessions?!" "Did you beat them? Did you hang them?" "You don't have arrest warrants, you are randomly tying people up and setting up private courts, this is illegal!" After being criticized, Zhao Bei and others immediately returned to the village and discussed a plan to remedy the situation with the branch secretary, Hao Chengde. They decided: on the one hand, Hao Chengde would come forward to apologize to the reactionary landlords and rich peasants Zhang Baoqi, Dong Qingxiang, and others, admitting their mistakes; on the other hand, they would try to minimize the matter and not continue to report it to the district or county. The Sixth District Committee reported the information it had gathered to the County Committee. The County Committee did not thoroughly study this information either, and simply forwarded it to the County Armed Forces Department for handling. The Armed Forces Department also sent people to investigate; however, they only investigated the village cadres' coercive command style, and did not investigate the activities of the reactionary elements, so naturally they could not understand the whole truth of the matter.
　　At this time, the Shijiazhuang Daily received a reader's voice letter signed "Junling" and published it. This letter distorted the facts of the Nanshijiabao Village incident, such as: "Comrade Zhao Bei was furious and immediately held a large gun, forcefully hitting Zhang Baoqi's left rib, injuring his rib (it is said that the injured person cannot turn over and is in unbearable pain, and those who have seen it say it is fractured)," (Later, Zhang Baoqi also denied that he had injured his rib). The Shijiazhuang Daily then cut out this letter and asked the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to forward it to the Zhengding County Committee for investigation and handling. Although the Zhengding County Committee later told the Shijiazhuang Daily the true situation of the incident; they still only punished the village cadres, and relaxed the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements. Furthermore, in the report written to the Prefectural Committee and the Shijiazhuang Daily, the County Committee also had the following words: "Regardless of the degree of the other party's reactionary nature, such failure to abide by government laws and regulations, and infringement of human rights, should be severely punished." (This report was written by Liu, the chief of the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau, and the Zhengding County Committee did not discuss or study it at all when it was submitted to the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee, and even did not even look at it. It was not until this time when studying this issue that Zhao Zuncai, the Secretary of the County Committee, saw this report, and he was shocked and said: "How could it be written like this?") Therefore, the punishment of the party member cadres in Nanshijiabao Village was only read by the Director of the Public Security Bureau at a County Committee meeting (not a meeting specifically to discuss this issue), and it was considered passed.
　　This unprincipled leniency towards reactionary landlords and the one-sided punishment of Zhao Bei and others affected the working morale of the village cadres. The village militia collectively handed over their guns to the platoon headquarters, saying: "We dare not do it in the future, people are plotting to harm us, and the superiors don't stand up for us, but punish us instead." Some of the masses said: "The government is too lenient." Individual district cadres also disagreed with the County Committee's punishment of Zhao Bei.
　　Later, after learning the truth of the incident, the Shijiazhuang Daily suggested to the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to re-handle this issue. After research, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the Zhengding County Committee to handle it. However, the Zhengding County Committee adopted an undisciplined attitude towards this instruction and did not re-handle it. It was not until the autumn grain collection meeting was held on September 26th that Hao Chengde, Zhao Bei, and other cadres from Nanshijiabao Village raised the issue of dealing with the anti-landlord movement in Nanshijiabao Village at the meeting. At this time, Zhao Zuncai, the Secretary of the County Committee, began to realize that the handling of this issue was biased and that these reactionary landlords should be suppressed, so he handed it over to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The County Committee still did not pay attention to whether Zhao Bei's punishment was correct. Even the matter of arresting reactionary landlords was not properly resolved; only Zhang Baoqi was arrested.
　　This makes it very clear: The Zhengding County Committee's understanding of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is insufficient, so it turns a blind eye to the activities of certain reactionary elements. Even when the reporter went to investigate this time, there were still individual county cadres who believed that there was no solid evidence to arrest Dong Qingxiang and others. These comrades seem not to understand that reactionary landlords and rich peasants have held five or six murder meetings, the last time dividing the work and deciding on the time for the murders. So Zhao Bei said angrily: "Do we have to wait until people kill us before it counts as solid evidence?!" Secondly, coercive commands from district and village cadres should be opposed, but it must be recognized that the reason for opposing coercive commands is to better implement the Party's policies; one must never abandon the policies in order to oppose coercive command styles. Zhen Diffei, the Secretary of the Sixth District Committee, did not first ask about the activities of the reactionary landlords when he discovered the case of reactionary landlords plotting to assassinate cadres, but only asked "Did you hang them, did you beat them?" This cannot be said to be a very serious bias. We know that some cadres in Zhengding County have very serious coercive command styles; but one must never go to another extreme in order to oppose coercive commands, and abandon the policies altogether. Third, the Zhengding County Committee has consistently maintained a serious bureaucratic style in handling this issue, and has always adopted the method of "handing it over to others to handle" for such a serious issue. When the reporter went to investigate this time, Zhao Zuncai, the Secretary of the County Committee, also said: "We have already arrested these three reactionary landlords and rich peasants." But after he asked the Public Security Bureau, he realized that only Zhang Baoqi had been arrested, and Dong Qingxiang and Dong Qingkui were still at large. No wonder the Zhengding County Committee has a serious sense of 麻痹 (paralysis) towards the class enemies who are using various methods to sabotage our various construction projects.
　　The Nanshijiabao Village branch was able to be vigilant against reactionary landlords, promptly discover the reactionary landlords' murder plot, and protect the village cadres, which is good. However, the manner in which Party member Zhao Bei and others handled this issue was inappropriate, arbitrarily tying people up and poking people with the butt of a gun, which is also not permitted by the Party's policies. However, the leadership must distinguish between right and wrong and distinguish between merits and demerits when handling this issue, and handle these issues correctly. The Zhengding County Committee's punishment of Zhao Bei is worth studying.

　　本报对于这一事件的调查
    编者按：本报接获读者张蓬来信后，即派记者至正定县南石家庄村进行调查。记者调查所得与张蓬来信所述事实大体相符合。但是这种对反动分子无原则的宽大的错误，主要责任是在中共正定县委会，而不在六区区委会。
    事情发生在去年八月九日。当南石家庄村民兵中队长赵背发觉反动地主富农张保祺、董庆祥等有杀害干部的阴谋后，即带领民兵将董庆祥绑到中队部、张保祺绑到另一个地方分别查问。董庆祥所谈的和张年子所汇报的情况完全一致。在查问中间，赵背曾用枪把戳了张保祺四下。第二天赵背、花子（民兵）二人就去区委会请示处理办法。区委书记甄涤非听到这一事件的报告后，立即吓得脸色发白，赶忙查问此事详细情形。但是甄涤非追问的不是反动地主富农活动情形，而只是追问：“你们一定吊打了人，否则怎么能问出这些口供来呢？！”“你们打了人没有？你们吊了人没有？”“你们没有拘捕证，你们随便绑人，私立公堂，这是违法的！”赵背等被批评后，立即回村和支部书记郝承德研究善后办法。他们决定：一方面由郝承德出面给反动地主富农张保祺、董庆祥等道歉，承认错误；另一方面尽量将事情缩小，不再向区、县继续报告。六区区委就把自己所了解的材料向县委汇报。县委也没有很好研究这一材料，就转给县武装部去办理。武装部也派人调查了；但是只调查了村干部强迫命令作风，而没有调查反动分子的活动情形，当然无法了解全部事实的真象。
    这时石家庄日报社接到了一封署名“俊岭”的读者呼声，并把这信发表了。这封来信歪曲了南石家庄村事件的事实，如：“赵背同志大怒，即手持大枪，用力打在张宝琦的左肋条上，将其肋条打伤（闻受伤者自言不能翻身，疼痛难忍，据一般外观者言已骨折）等等”（后来张保祺也否认打伤了他肋条）。石家庄日报又把这信剪下来请中共石家庄地委纪律检查委员会转交正定县委会调查处理。正定县委就把信交给公安局处理。后来正定县委虽然把事件的真实情形告诉了石家庄日报；但仍然只对村干部进行了处分，而放松了对反革命分子的镇压。并且县委在向地委及石家庄日报写的报告里，还有这样的话：“不管其对方的反动程度如何，这样不遵守政府法令，侵犯人权，是应受到严厉制裁的。”（这个报告是由公安局司法股刘股长写的，送交石家庄地委时正定县委根本没有讨论研究，甚至连看都没有看，直到这次研究这一问题时，县委书记赵尊才看到了这份报告，他大吃一惊地说：“怎么这样写的？”）因此对南石家庄村党员干部的处分，只是由公安局局长在一次县委会议上（不是专门讨论这一问题的会议）念了一遍，就算通过了。
    这种对反动地主无原则的宽大，对赵背等进行片面的处分，影响了村干部的工作情绪。村里的民兵集体向中队部交枪，他们说：“今后可不敢干了，人家谋害我们，上级不给作主，还处分了我们。”有些群众说：“政府太宽大了。”个别区干部也不同意县委会给赵背的处分。
    以后，石家庄日报社在了解了这一事件的真象后，就向中共石家庄地委建议重新处理这一问题。中共石家庄地委纪律检查委员会，经过研究后，即指示正定县委处理。但是，正定县委对这一指示，采取了无组织无纪律的态度，就没有重新处理。直至九月二十六日召开秋征会议时，南石家庄村干部郝承德、赵背等在会上又提出关于处理南石家庄村反地动主的问题。这时县委书记赵尊才开始认识到处理这一问题有偏向，应该对这些反动地主进行镇压，于是交给公安局去办理。关于赵背的处分是否正确，仍没有引起县委的注意。就是逮捕反动地主的事情，事实上也没有得到正确解决，只逮捕了张保祺。
    这就很明白：正定县委对镇压反革命活动的政策是认识不足的，因此对某些反动分子的活动熟视无睹。就是这次记者去调查时，也还有个别县干部认为董庆祥等没有确实证据可以逮捕。这些同志好像不了解反动地主富农已开过五、六次杀人会议，最后一次分了工，并决定了杀人的时间的事情。所以赵背气愤的说：“难道非得等到人家把俺们杀了，才算有了确实证据吗？！”其次，关于区村干部的强迫命令是应该反对的，但是必须认识所以反对强迫命令，是为了更好地贯彻党的政策；决不能为了反对强迫命令作风，连政策也不要了。六区区委书记甄涤非，在发现了反动地主阴谋暗杀干部案件时，不先问反动地主活动情形，而只问“吊了人没有，打了人没有？”这不能不说是一个很严重的偏向。我们知道正定县某些干部的强迫命令是很严重的；但绝不应为了反对强迫命令而走到另一个极端，连政策也不要了。第三，正定县委在处理这一问题时，自始至终是存在着严重的官僚主义的作风，对这样严重的问题，一直采取了“交给别人办理”的办法。这次记者去调查时，县委书记赵尊还说：“我们已经把这三个反动地主富农逮捕了。”但等他问过公安局后，才知道只逮捕了张保祺，还有董庆祥、董庆魁仍然逍遥法外。无怪正定县委对正在用各种方法破坏我各种建设的阶级敌人存在着严重的麻痹思想。
    南石家庄村支部能够对反动地主提高警惕，及时发觉反动地主杀人阴谋，保护了村干部，这是好的。但是党员赵背等处理这一问题的方式是不妥当的，随便绑人，用枪把戳人，这也是党的政策所不允许的。但是领导上在处理这一问题时必须分清是非，分清功过，正确的来处理这些问题。正定县委给赵背的处分是值得研究的。
