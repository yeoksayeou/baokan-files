　　Cultural Life Updates
　　Significant Results from Shenyang Elementary Schools Learning Soviet Teaching Methods
　　Five primary schools in Shenyang have achieved good results from learning the Soviet segmented and five-level grading teaching methods. This teaching method prepares lessons based on student performance and creates teaching support plans to address the weaknesses of certain students. This not only takes care of the learning of the less proficient students, but also consolidates the academic performance of the excellent students. The tutoring system, which previously relied on self-study, catered to the excellent students and neglected the difficulties of the average and weaker students in understanding. The new teaching method also overcomes the phenomenon of crowded homework assignments.
　　Beijing Health Bureau Strives to Basically Eradicate Smallpox This Year
　　In response to the call of the National Health Conference to "eradicate smallpox within three years," the Beijing Public Health Bureau has decided to make the prevention of smallpox one of its central tasks in 1951 (the second year), striving to basically eradicate smallpox within the year. In 1950, Beijing achieved significant results by vigorously promoting vaccination, with only eleven cases of smallpox and four deaths throughout the year, and no cases after May. The morbidity rate decreased by 95.1% compared to 1949, and the mortality rate decreased by 96.3%. This year, vaccination will focus on newborns and preschool children, striving to achieve full vaccination. Secondly, adults and children who have not been vaccinated in the past three years and those newly moved into the city will be universally vaccinated according to the actual situation. It is planned to vaccinate 280,000 people in the spring, with vaccinations taking place from March 1st to March 31st.

　　This Year's Filming Plan for the North China Film Studio Central and Southern China News Photography Team
　　In 1950, the North China Film Studio Central and Southern China News Photography Team completed two medium-sized documentaries, "Jingdezhen Porcelain" and "Guangdong Sugar Cane and Antimony Mine," and twenty-eight news short films such as "General Lin Biao's Triumphant Return to Wuhan." This year, it has been decided to shoot five documentaries: "Dongting Lake Carp" (already filmed), "Land Reform in Central and Southern China," "Hainan Island After Liberation," "Facing the Ocean," and "The Rich Lakeside Area." The news short film plan for this year is to release one local news issue every month or every half month. The team guarantees that the quality will be improved compared to last year.
