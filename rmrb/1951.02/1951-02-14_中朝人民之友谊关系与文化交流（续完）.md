    Printing is another important topic for commemorating Sino-Korean cultural exchange. The Chinese people were the first in the world to invent printing. Roughly 1200 years ago, our ancestors were already using woodblock printing to produce Buddhist scriptures and images, at least 600 years earlier than the earliest religious image printing in Europe. Printing gradually became applied to almanacs and dictionaries. But in the first two hundred years after its invention, although it was an important medium for popularizing culture among the masses, the scholar-official class, accustomed to expensive and laborious handwritten books, still disdained it. It was not until the 10th century that the ruling class began to use it on a large scale. Printing was also introduced to Korea at this time, initially for printing Buddhist scriptures. The earliest extant woodblock printed Buddhist scripture dates back to 950 AD, and in 1087, the carving of the entire Chinese-translated Tripitaka was completed. Although Japan learned printing from China in the 8th century, the large-scale undertaking of carving the entire Tripitaka was 600 years later than Korea. The second carving of the Tripitaka was completed in the mid-13th century. These more than 80,000 woodblocks, the crystallization of the labor of thousands of Korean working people, were discovered in a temple in the early 20th century. This is one of the treasures of Sino-Korean cultural exchange and the friendship between the two peoples.
    The evolution of printing from carving entire woodblocks to using movable type, which could be assembled and disassembled at will and each character could be used many times, was a great advance. In the 11th century, Bi Sheng invented movable type using clay, but the clay was not durable, and his method did not become widespread. After accepting Chinese printing technology, the Korean people used their intelligence and wisdom to develop it, innovating and improving upon it. At the end of the 14th century, they began to invent casting molds and use copper to make movable type, 50 years earlier than Gutenberg's use of movable type in Europe. In 1403, a type-casting office was established, and hundreds of thousands of types were cast within a few months. Subsequent castings were frequent, and books circulated widely. All books that Korea did not have were purchased from China and immediately printed with movable type. The printing bureau worked every day, and "official and private books were too numerous to read." Inspired and influenced by Korea, China also used copper movable type to print books at the end of the 15th century. By the 18th century, China began to use wood movable type, and this method was also introduced to Korea. The mutual learning and imitation of movable type printing symbolize the friendship and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Korean people, and illustrate that Sino-Korean culture has historically been closely connected.
    Paper, which is closely related to printing, must also be mentioned when discussing Sino-Korean cultural exchange. The Chinese people's invention of papermaking is a major contribution to world civilization. From the west, it was introduced to Europe through Central Asia and Arabia, and from the east, it was introduced to Korea and Japan. After accepting Chinese papermaking technology, Korea, like printing, improved upon it and manufactured paper that China did not have. In addition to using materials such as hemp and mulberry bark, they also used cotton to make paper, which was unique to Korea. Since the 11th century, the Chinese people have always praised and cherished Korean paper, one of its characteristics being its firmness and exquisiteness. The development of copper movable type was probably related to the firmness of the paper. In addition to using it for window paper and clothing linings, the Chinese people also used it in the armor worn by soldiers. "Goryeo paper" is still a Korean product favored by the Chinese people today, and its use for letter paper is particularly praised by those who love art. Korean ink has been praised by the Chinese since Su Dongpo. The art of making brushes was also introduced from China, but it utilized a raw material not previously used in China - yellow weasel hair. The Song Dynasty already recognized it as a Korean specialty, and later China also imitated its manufacture. Korean pottery and porcelain manufacturing was influenced by China, but surpassed it. Celadon with jade color was praised by Xu Jing as "exquisitely crafted and particularly beautiful in color." After the mid-12th century, "celadon inlay," which did not exist in China, appeared. This involved carving patterns on the clay body, then embedding white clay, black clay, or cinnabar in the recessed areas, and then applying celadon glaze for firing. After firing, the patterns would appear in pure white, pure black, and bright red, making them exceptionally beautiful. These are all flowers that have taken root and sprouted in Korean soil from Chinese culture, and have been cherished and loved by the people of China and Korea for hundreds of years!
    From the above, we know that Korean handicrafts were very developed after the 10th century. There is one crystallization of the wisdom of the Korean people that gradually spread to China, and that we still benefit from today, which is the folding fan, also called the gathered-head fan. In ancient China, there were silk fans, feather fans, and palmetto fans, but no folding fans, which were first invented by the Koreans. Su Dongpo praised "Goryeo white pine fans, which when unfolded are more than a foot wide, and when folded are only two fingers thick." Xu Jing also praised Goryeo pine fans: "They are made by thinly shaving the supple branches of pine into strands, pounding and pressing them into threads, and then weaving them. The flowers on them are no less skillful than rattan weaving." He also said that folding fans with bamboo ribs and rattan paper "can be carried in the sleeve, making them very convenient."
    Earlier, it was mentioned that Korean ramie cloth was cherished by the Chinese people, while Korean cotton was imported from China. In the mid-14th century, Mun Ik-jeom brought back cotton seeds from the Yuan Dynasty after returning from an embassy, and entrusted them to Jeong Cheon-ik for planting. Initially, they did not know how to cultivate them, and only one stalk remained withered. Later, they were moved to the north, where they flourished. The cotton gin and spinning wheel were all created by Cheon-ik himself. In the early 12th century, flowers and trees were transplanted from China several times. In the early 17th century, there was a climbing peony in Gyeongheung, Hamgyeongbuk-do, said to have been moved to the north after the Jin people destroyed the Song Dynasty, and then imported into Korea. Korea also learned from China in terms of agriculture. In 1362, Baek Mun-bo suggested that "the people of Jianghuai in China are farmers who do not worry about floods and droughts because of the power of waterwheels. Our Eastern people who cultivate paddy fields must draw canals, and do not understand the ease of waterwheel irrigation." Therefore, he advocated imitating the Chinese style of manufacturing waterwheels and promoting them in rural areas, but it was not widely used. At the end of the 18th century, Park Ji-won still said: "The art of waterwheels, which the Chinese have been using for thousands of years, has not yet been pioneered in our country." Xu Jing recorded Korean agriculture, saying "cattle labor and farming tools are largely the same," indicating that there was not much difference in production technology and tools between China and Korea in the early 12th century. However, in the 700 years since then, China has had many large-scale peasant uprisings. Each uprising, after striking the feudal ruling class, changed social relations of production to some extent, thus promoting the development of productive forces. Therefore, by the end of the 18th century, in the more stagnant Korean feudal society, agricultural technology and tools had fallen behind China again. Park Ji-won had been an envoy to China and paid special attention to the agricultural situation. After returning to his country, he suggested imitating Chinese agricultural tools. He also advocated changing the method of "broad planting with scattered seeds, seedlings growing without rows" and adopting the method of Liaodong fields "all made into fine ridges, millet and beans growing along the ridges, looking from afar like a tapestry." He also said that Korean farmers did not pay enough attention to fertilizer accumulation, "the excrement of people and animals in a household is inherently small, and the way of collecting it is not proper, losing its full effect by 40 or 50 percent." Coupled with "broad planting with scattered seeds," "this small amount of fertilizer is spread thinly over a vast expanse of fields," completely failing to achieve results. Therefore, he introduced the situation in China, saying: "Having passed through the area between Yanjing and Ji, I often saw residents hanging a basket around their waist, holding an iron hoe in their hand, and stooping behind cattle and horses to pick up what they had left behind, which can be said to be very diligent. Everywhere, piles of manure are square and angular, neatly arranged like pavilions, and I have never seen them scattered and uneven." The description of the hard work and achievements of North China's farmers 150 years ago is exactly the same as today. Park Ji-won's work of introduction is also worthy of praise in the history of Sino-Korean people's friendship.
            Seven
    At the end of the 14th century, individual Chinese people had already participated in the Korean struggle against foreign aggression. Two hundred years later, when Japan's Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea, China again sent a large army to rescue them, repelling the invaders and restoring Korean territory. Although a very small number of people in the Ming Dynasty opposed sending troops to aid Korea, the vast majority recognized that Japan's invasion of Korea was the first step in invading China, and that saving their neighbor was saving themselves. China and Korea shared the same interests, like lips and teeth. Whether from a moral or strategic point of view, they should send troops. Therefore, China correctly decided on the policy of sending troops to aid Korea. On June 11, 1592, Seoul fell, and on June 23, Pyongyang fell. On July 15, the Ming Dynasty's support army set out from Liaodong, crossed the Yalu River on the 23rd, and marched on Pyongyang on August 21. However, due to unfamiliarity with the terrain and heavy rain, they were defeated, and the guerrilla Shi Ru fought to the death. The Ming Dynasty then continued to send reinforcements, appointing Song Yingchang as the strategist and Li Rusong as the commander of the Eastern Expedition. At that time, the army discussed methods to defend against Japanese arquebuses. The vanguard Qian Shizhen said: "Brave soldiers on the battlefield will either die or be wounded. Although arquebuses can kill people from a hundred paces away, they are not to be feared in close combat!" This is the same spirit as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army today, facing the enemy's superior equipment of airplanes and artillery, but rushing to the enemy's front, outflanking the enemy's rear, and using light weapons to fight tanks, leaving the American army helpless to resist. Soldiers fighting for justice have always been fearless!
    Li Rusong's ancestors were originally Korean and moved to Liaodong. Because the main force had not yet gathered, he first led 40,000 troops from the West, Liao, and South, and besieged Pyongyang on February 6, 1593. At this time, the elite Japanese army of Konishi Yukinaga's forces were entrenched in Pyongyang, and the Koreans felt that the city was strong and well-defended, worrying that "the Heavenly soldiers (referring to the Ming soldiers) are also human, and it will probably not be easy to take it." However, the Chinese army fought bravely, and on the morning of February 8, Pyongyang was liberated. Koreans recorded the situation of the siege that morning, saying: "The armies advanced gradually in close order. From sight of the icy road, horses ran, flying dust mixed with dirt, like white mist rising into the sky. The early sun shone down, helmets and armor, silver light灿烂, dazzling万状, strange夺目。The thieves also erected many flags of five colors on the ramparts, tying long spears and broadswords, with their blades facing outward, as a defensive measure. The commander led hundreds of personal soldiers and horses to approach the city, commanding the soldiers. Suddenly, a large cannon was fired, and the formations followed suit, firing in unison, sounding like ten thousand thunders, shaking mountains and hills. Rockets were fired in a chaotic manner, with smoke and flames spreading for dozens of miles, making it impossible to distinguish anything at close range. Only the shouts were heard mixed with the sound of cannons, like ten thousand bees buzzing." The Japanese army rained down lead balls, boiling water, and large stones from the city, and the Ming army attacking the city "corpses followed one after another." The guerrilla Wu Weizhong was hit in the chest by a bullet, but he worked even harder to supervise the battle. The vice-general Luo Shangzhi climbed the ramparts, and the enemy threw down a large stone, injuring his foot. He still held a halberd and climbed straight up at the risk of being hit by a shield, and the armies roared and followed closely, and the Japanese army could not resist. Both men were over sixty years old at the time. Li Rusong also personally supervised the battle, and his horse was shot and fell. Let's look at the recollection of Qian Shizhen, the southern army general who first climbed the city: "Shouting loudly, I approached the city. The Japanese slaves rained down lead bullets, arrows, and stones. The vanguard was slightly repelled by the wounded. I drew my sword and chopped at the top, and then encouraged the wounded to advance. The rear team continued to arrive, and the shouts moved the heavens and the earth. There was a hundred-chief named Wu Jihui, who jumped over the ramparts, was struck by the thieves and fell. He climbed up again and chopped down several people. I and my family members Yang Wenkui, Xu Dasheng, Guo Ziming, etc. had already climbed the ramparts and ascended. Then we conquered the city, the sun was not yet at noon." After entering the city, the street fighting continued. The Japanese army hid in people's homes and fired guns from inside. The Ming army fired rockets together to smoke them out, burning many to death. The remaining crowd "abandoned their armor and threw away their weapons, and fled in panic." The Japanese army in various places also fled south at the sight of the wind. At the same time, the people of Korea in various places rose up to resist, and Yi Sun-sin's turtle ship fleet blocked the Japanese navy from going west on the southern sea. The morale of the Japanese invading army was depressed, and they lacked food, so they withdrew and sought peace. The victorious Battle of Pyongyang in 1593 played a decisive role. In this battle, the Chinese people showed a high degree of bravery and brotherly friendship to the Korean people!
    Toyotomi Hideyoshi's peace conditions were very harsh, such as ceding half of the eight provinces of Korea to Japan, and sending Korean princes and ministers as hostages. Of course, China and Korea could not accept them. So in 1597, Hideyoshi sent troops again. The Ming Dynasty also sent several land armies into Korea to resist, cooperating with the Korean army to defeat the Japanese invaders one after another. In particular, the solidarity and cooperation of the Chinese and Korean navies was the main reason for finally driving out the invaders. In the winter of 1598, Konishi Yukinaga was surrounded by the Chinese and Korean armies commanded by Liu Ting and Gwon Yul in Suncheon, on the southern coast of Korea. Chen Lin and Yi Sun-sin also commanded the Chinese and Korean navies to attack repeatedly, winning every time. After a stalemate of several months, the Japanese army was short of food and in a difficult situation. On December 15, Shimazu Yoshihiro led a large navy of 500 warships from Sacheon to rescue them. At midnight, when they passed through Noryang Strait north of Namhae Island, the Chinese and Korean joint fleet suddenly attacked. They attacked from the left and right, arrows and stones rained down, and firewood was thrown in disorder. Many Japanese ships were burned and could not hold out, retreating into Guanyinpo Harbor. However, because there was no way to go, they turned back, and it was already the morning of the 16th. The Chinese and Korean warships advanced to meet them, and Yi Sun-sin's fleet advanced to command and was surrounded by Japanese ships. Chen Lin hurriedly drove his ships forward and rushed into the encirclement to rescue them, but they were also trapped together. Chen Lin ordered the ships to drop anchor and not move, shouting and firing cannons. Waiting for the Japanese soldiers to board the ship, the soldiers rose up to fight the enemy, and thousands of Japanese soldiers fell into the water and died. Chen Lin suddenly rang the bell to withdraw the troops, and the enemy soldiers suspected and did not understand, and retreated slightly. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Ming army "scattered spray tubes from above onto the enemy ships, and the wind was strong and the fire was fierce. Hundreds of thief ships were burned in an instant, and the sea was completely red." Yi Sun-sin therefore broke out of the encirclement and attacked the enemy's large building ships, shooting the main general to death. The Japanese ships then abandoned Chen Lin and attacked Yi Sun-sin. Chen Lin was able to escape and joined forces with Yi Sun-sin's army. "They fired tiger crouching cannons, shattering the enemy ships." Ming Dynasty Vice-General Deng Zilong, a 70-year-old veteran, led 200 men to attack bravely, but the Ming army's firearms were mistakenly thrown into Deng Zilong's ship, causing it to catch fire. The thief ships took advantage of the situation to counterattack, and Deng Zilong fought to the death and died in battle. Yi Sun-sin saw that the friendly army's ship was on fire and rushed to the rescue, pursuing the Japanese army. By noon, the Japanese soldiers were defeated, "burned, drowned, captured, and beheaded almost entirely, and Yoshihiro and others barely escaped with fifty remaining ships." Konishi Yukinaga also took the opportunity to flee back to his country, thus ending their cruel and shameful acts of aggression. The Korean national hero Yi Sun-sin died heroically in this battle, but his patriotic enthusiasm, combat bravery, careful strategy, and his contribution to uniting the Chinese and Korean brotherly forces to achieve final victory, is something that can never be forgotten in the history of the friendly relations between the two peoples!
    China's support for Korea was not only about sending troops to fight and providing military supplies, but also about fundamentally helping Korea by teaching them how to train soldiers and manufacture weapons. In the winter of 1592, Korea had already selected "elite soldiers" to learn swordsmanship from Luo Shangzhi. The following year, following Li Rusong's suggestion, the Training Command was established, and soldiers were trained using Qi Jiguang's "Jixiao Xinshu" method. Liu Seong-ryong and others personally discussed and questioned Chinese generals about difficulties. They also recruited "martial ministers who are brave and resourceful" to belong to the Training Command and study the "Jixiao Xinshu." They also selected 40 or 50 elite soldiers to learn the tactics of artillery vehicles from Liu Huangshang, the Ming strategist's advisor. In 1595, among the twelve Chinese training teachers sent, three who were proficient in swordsmanship and other arts stayed in Seoul to supervise the armies learning day and night. The rest were assigned to various provinces to train artillerymen, archers, and assassins. As for weapons, the art of firearms had already been introduced from China to Korea at the end of the 14th century. In 1593, because a Chinese centurion named Zhou was proficient in "the method of making gunpowder," smelters and gunpowder makers were widely sought after to learn from him. They also imitated the iron whips made by Liu Ting and taught the poison applied to arrows. After repelling the Japanese pirates, the rice and beans left by the Ming army in the granaries of Uiju and other places were all given to the Korean people. When the Ming army returned to China, they left several thousand people to help train soldiers and guard fortresses. This campaign lasted for seven years, and the soldiers were deployed from the five towns of Ji, Bao, Liao, Xuan, and Da in the north, and from the provinces of Southern Zhili, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan in the south. There were also 15,000 Miao soldiers from the southwest. Food and salaries were transported from Liaodong, Shandong, Tianjin, and other places. The military expenses amounted to millions of taels of silver. Therefore, this war to aid Korea and resist Japan 350 years ago was supported by the power of the entire Chinese people! Shi Ru, Deng Zilong, Qian Shizhen, Li Rusong, Chen Lin, and all the soldiers who died, were injured, and fought, gloriously fulfilled the hopes of the vast Chinese people for them. In learning new patriotism and internationalism today, the 16th-century Sino-Korean joint anti-Japanese war to defend our homes and countries is a good topic for us.
    Three hundred years after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea failed, the Japanese ruling class once again dreamed of conquering Asia, and the first to bear the brunt was still the Korean Peninsula, the bridge between Japan and the Asian continent. At that time, Li Hongzhang and others were not unaware of Japan's ambitions towards Korea and its various plans of aggression. However, the capitulationist muddled thinking of the ruling class in a semi-colonial country made them dare not directly and actively support Korea to resist Japan. They only fantasized about relying on Tsarist Russia and Britain to come forward to mediate or intervene with force, while they shrank back and waited, "do not meddle." However, the Chinese people had long seen through the viciousness of Japan and recognized that China and Korea shared the same interests, and that China should help Korea as soon as possible to deal with the common enemy. For example, Yao Xiguang's secret memorial to Li Hongzhang in 1887, planning for Korea, said, "The southern border of the three eastern provinces is intertwined with Korea, and what we rely on as a boundary is, apart from Changbai Mountain, the two rivers of Yalu and Tumen, but both can be crossed on horseback. Without Korea, the three eastern provinces will not have a day of peace. Korea is next to the bed in the three eastern provinces, and it is also the shield of the three eastern provinces." The public opinion during the Sino-Japanese War can be glimpsed from the "New Compilation of Current Events" published in 1895, which compiled the discussions on newspapers at that time. An article titled "On Defending Against the Japanese" pointed out that Japan's invasion of Korea was a "plan to attack the State of Guo under the guise of passing through the State of Yu." Another article titled "An Appeal" stated that Korea's relationship with China was closer than that of Ryukyu: "Ryukyu is the fingernail of China, and Korea is the elbow of China. Although fingernails belong to the human body, cutting them off is not a pity. How can anyone not cherish their elbow and cut it off?" It went on to say that Korea was adjacent to China's three eastern provinces, and if Japan occupied Korea, "with three or four ironclad ships, cruising up and down the Yalu River," the sound of cannons would be loud, and the beacon fires would be clear. At that time, could the people of China "sleep peacefully and high, and ignore everything?" It also said that the people of the whole country "upon hearing of the defeats at Asan and Pyongyang, were all the more excited, raised their sleeves, and were furious, wanting to kill foreigners to their satisfaction." These words all show that the Chinese people at that time stood with the Korean people and advocated that the Chinese government send troops to resist the common enemy, the Japanese invaders. This spirit has remained unchanged since the end of the 16th century, and is the inevitable result of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.
    In 1894, the Manchu Qing government sent troops to Korea, originally to help the Korean rulers suppress the Korean people's struggle against feudalism and imperialism - the Donghak Party. However, when the Chinese army arrived, the Donghak Party had already temporarily retreated. The Chinese army did not participate in the suppression, but instead shed blood on Korean soil to defend the territory of their neighbor and resist the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people. In the Battle of Asan in July 1894, the Chinese army fought against a superior enemy with a small force. Not only did reinforcements not arrive, but there was a shortage of ammunition and rations. "Laborers were not prepared, carts had no resources, soldiers carried their own rations, and guns had no extra bullets." Under these circumstances, Wu Bei Academy students Yu Guangxin and three others gathered brave soldiers on the night of the 28th and ambushed a village near the bridge in the rain, attacking the vanguard of the Japanese army that was attacking Seonghwan Station northeast of Asan. They inflicted considerable casualties and killed several Japanese officers. The Japanese army was frightened and retreated, and many drowned while crossing the bridge. However, because the main force continued to arrive, the Chinese side could not respond, and all four were sacrificed. In the Battle of Pyongyang on September 15, Ma Yukun personally supervised the infantry to intercept the Japanese army on the east, "engaging in close combat with blood, resisting to the death." The Chinese army on the southwest side joined the battle, "bullets rained down." The artillery fort in the southeast corner of the city also fired cannons, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. From 6:00 in the morning to 2:30 in the afternoon, they could not advance and had to retreat. Zuo Baogui defended the north side of the city, commanding from the city himself. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, but continued to attack fiercely, occupying the surrounding hills and forests. On the afternoon of the 15th, Zuo Baogui was directing the firing of the heaviest cannon when a cannon hand was suddenly hit by a bullet and died beside him. At this time, he had already suffered several injuries, but he did not flinch, and walked up to fire the cannon himself. Unexpectedly, he was hit by another bullet in the leg, but he quickly wrapped the wound with cloth, bravely stood up, and continued to encourage the soldiers to fight. Before he could finish speaking, another bullet hit him, this time fatally, and he fell to the ground and died after being carried down the city. Several deputy generals were also blown up and killed together. In the Battle of Pyongyang, more than 2,000 Chinese soldiers were sacrificed. At this time, Chinese warships escorted the army to reinforce Korea, and on September 17, they engaged the Japanese navy in a naval battle at Dadonggou, at the mouth of the Yalu River. Deng Shichang, the captain of the Zhiyuan ship, pushed the fast ship towards the Yoshino ship, the fastest of the four Japanese fast ships, and was hit by a torpedo. The ship sank quickly, and all 250 people on board drowned. Deng Shichang was rescued from the water, but because the entire ship had died in service, he was determined not to live alone and threw himself into the water and died. The Jingyuan ship caught fire, and captain Lin Yongsheng ordered the fire to be extinguished while pursuing the wounded enemy ship. It was also hit by a torpedo and exploded, and 270 people perished with the ship. In total, the naval battle at the mouth of the Yalu River resulted in the sacrifice of 87 Chinese officers, more than 1,000 sailors, and more than 400 wounded. During the Sino-Japanese War, the Donghak Party continued to carry out armed struggle against the Japanese invading army in Korea. Japan spent a great deal of force to suppress it. Although the detailed situation cannot be examined due to lack of information, we do know that the Chinese and Korean people were resisting the same enemy on different battlefields at that time. Due to the corruption and incompetence of the capitulationist Manchu Qing ruling class, the glorious achievements and heroic sacrifices of the Chinese soldiers failed to reverse the situation in Korea. However, in the history of friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean people, in the sense of resisting the common enemy of the two peoples, we must not forget the martyrs who sacrificed in the Sino-Japanese War!

    The above selectively reviews the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Korean people. From these facts, we know how closely the Chinese and Korean people have shared the same interests and been interconnected for two thousand years. Whether culturally, economically, or militarily, we and the Korean people have always been mutually dependent and mutually helpful. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, these two Asian brotherly nations, based on the foundation of two thousand years of friendship, will completely eliminate the aggressive forces of American imperialism and permanently unite, help each other, and cooperate closely!
    The author previously published an article entitled "Historical Relations between China and Korea" in the third issue of the third volume of "New Construction." At that time, the materials I had were not enough, and my views were not comprehensive enough, so I failed to fully express the friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean people. In the past two months, I have widely collected materials and rewritten this article, reviewing the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Korean people for two thousand years. I hope that readers will criticize and correct it, and I hope that those who have read the previous article will refer to this article, then the author will be fortunate.
    Finished writing on February 3, 1951, recorded at Tsinghua University.

　　中朝人民之友谊关系与文化交流（续完）
    清华大学历史系教授　周一良

    印刷术是纪念中朝人民文化交流的另一个重要题目。中国人民是世界上头一个发明印刷术的。大致距今一千二百年前，我们的祖先已经利用木板雕印佛经佛画，比欧洲最早雕印宗教图像至少要早六百年。印刷术逐渐应用到历书和字书等。但在初发明的二百年间，它虽是人民大众当中普及文化的重要媒介，习惯于昂贵而费事的写本的士大夫阶级，还是不屑一顾的。到了十世纪，统治阶级才大规模地应用它。朝鲜也就在这时传入印刷术。起初也是用以雕印佛经。现存最早刻本佛经的年代是九五○年，一○八七年又完成了全部汉译大藏经的雕板。日本虽然在八世纪就从中国学会了印刷术，但雕印全藏这种大规模事业，却比朝鲜要晚六百年。十三世纪中叶第二次雕造大藏经板完成。这八万多块朝鲜千百劳动人民的劳动结晶品，二十世纪初在一个庙里发现，这是中朝文化交流和两国人民友谊的珍物之一。
    印刷术从雕刻整块木板到使用活字，随意装拆，每个字能利用许多次，是一个很大的进步。十一世纪中毕升发明用胶泥作活字，但胶泥不坚固，他的方法未曾普遍流行。朝鲜人民接受了中国的印刷术后，运用自己的聪明智慧，加以发扬，推陈出新。在十四世纪末起始发明铸字模，用铜来制活字。比欧洲谷腾堡使用活字印刷，要早五十年。一四○三年设立铸字所，数月之间铸成数十万。以后屡次铸造，书籍大为流通。凡朝鲜所无的书都从中国购求，随即用活字印出。印书局无一日不工作，“公私书籍至不可胜读”。中国受了朝鲜的刺激和影响，十五世纪末也用铜活字印书。到十八世纪，中国起始用木制活字，这种办法又传入朝鲜。活字印刷术的彼此学习仿效，正象征了中朝人民的友谊与互助，说明了中朝文化在历史上一直是息息相通的。
    与印刷术有密切关系的纸也是讲中朝文化交流必须提到的。中国人民所发明的造纸之术是我们对世界文明一大贡献。西边通过中亚阿拉伯传入欧洲，东方传入朝鲜日本。朝鲜接受中国造纸术后，也和印刷术一样，更加以改进，制造出中国所没有的纸张。除用麻和桑皮等材料外，还用棉造纸，为朝鲜所独创。从十一世纪以来，中国人一直称赞宝爱朝鲜的纸，它的特点之一是坚厚精致。铜活字之所以发达，大约也跟纸质的坚牢有关。中国人民除去糊窗、衬衣服之外，还把它用在兵士所穿的甲里。“高丽纸”今天还是中国人民所喜欢的朝鲜土产，发笺更为爱好美术的人所艳称。朝鲜的墨自苏东坡以来为中国人所夸赞。造笔之术也传自中国，但利用了中国未曾用的原料——黄鼠狼毛。宋代已经认它为朝鲜特产，后来中国也仿效制造。朝鲜的陶磁器制造受中国影响，而青出于蓝。翡色的青磁曾被徐兢称为“制作工巧，色泽尤佳”。十二世纪中叶以后，又出现了中国所没有的“青磁象嵌”。是在胎土上刻画花纹，再在凹处嵌入白土、黑土或朱砂，然后敷上青磁釉去烧。烧成以后花纹便显出纯白、纯黑、鲜红三色，异常好看。这些都是中国文化在朝鲜土地上生根发芽而又开出来的花朵，数百年来为中朝两国人民所宝贵所爱好的！
    由上文所述，我们知道十世纪以后朝鲜的手工艺便很发达。有一样朝鲜人民智慧的结晶，逐渐流传到中国，我们今天还受用着的东西，就是摺扇，也叫作聚头扇。中国古代有纨扇、羽扇、蒲葵扇之类，但没有摺扇，这是朝鲜人最先发明的。苏东坡曾称赞“高丽白松扇，展之广尺余，合之只两指。”徐兢也赞美高丽松扇：“取松之柔条细削成缕，捶压成线，而后织成。上有花文，不减穿藤之巧。”又说竹骨藤纸的摺扇“藏于怀袖之间，其用甚便”。
    前面提过朝鲜的苎布是中国人民所珍视的，而朝鲜的木棉却是从中国输入的。十四世纪中叶，文益渐从元朝奉使归国，带回木棉种子，交给郑天益种植。起初不懂如何培养，枯得只剩一茎。后来移到北方，才蕃衍起来。取子车缫丝车都是天益自己创造的。十二世纪初还数次从中国移植过花木。十七世纪初咸镜北道庆兴地方有蔓生牡丹，据说是金人灭宋后移到北边，然后输入朝鲜。农业方面朝鲜也曾跟中国学习。一三六二年白文宝建议，以为中国“江淮之民为农而不忧水旱者，水车之力也。吾东方人治水田者必引沟浍，不解水车之易注。”所以主张仿中国样式制造水车，在农村推行。但并未能广泛使用。到十八世纪末，朴趾源还说：“车戽之术中国千余年来所已茶饭用之者，而我国尚未开创。”徐兢记载朝鲜农事说“牛工农具大同小异”，可见十二世纪初年中朝两国的生产技术与工具没什么太大区别。不过中国在这以后七百年间，有许多次大规模的农民起义。每次起义打击了封建统治阶级之后，多少变动了社会的生产关系，因而推动生产力的发展。所以到十八世纪末叶，停滞性更强的朝鲜封建社会里，农业技术与工具便又落在中国之后了。朴趾源曾出使过中国，对农业情形特别注意，回国建议仿制中国农具。他又主张改变“广亩漫种，苗生无行列”的方式，采取辽东田地“皆作细垄，黍稷粟豆挟垄而生，远而望之，如铺万匹摩衲”的办法。又说朝鲜农民对于蓄肥方法太不讲求，“一户之内人畜之所遗秽本自无几，而收聚之不如法而失其全功者，十之四五”，加以“阔亩漫播”，于是“以此无几之粪秽，泛布广占之田畴”，完全不能收效。因此他介绍中国的情形说：“尝经过燕蓟之间，每见居民腰悬一篮，手持铁搭，伛偻于来牛去马之后，而拾其所遗，可谓勤苦之甚。而到处粪堆方圆棱隅，整整如亭台，未见其浪藉差池。”所描写一百五十年前华北农民辛勤劳作的状况和成绩，正和今天相仿佛。朴趾源的这个介绍的工作，在中朝人民友谊关系的历史上，也是值得表扬的。

    十四世纪末，个别的中国人已经参加朝鲜抵抗外侮的斗争。二百年后，日本丰臣秀吉侵略朝鲜时，中国又派大兵救援，打退了侵略者，光复朝鲜国土。虽然当时明朝也有极少数人反对出兵援助，但绝大多数人都认清日本侵略朝鲜为侵略中国的第一步，救邻即是自救。中朝两国利害相同唇齿相依，无论从道义上战略上都应该出兵。于是中国正确地决定了出兵援朝的政策。一五九二年六月十一日汉城陷落，二十三日平壤陷落。七月十五日明朝援军由辽东启行，二十三日渡鸭绿江，八月二十一日进军平壤。但因地理不熟，又下大雨，打了败仗，游击史儒力战而死。明朝于是继续增派援军，命宋应昌为经略，李如松为东征提督。当时军中讨论防御日本鸟铳的方法。先锋钱世祯说：“壮士临阵，不死则伤。鸟铳虽能杀人于百步之外，至短兵相接，不足虑也！”这和今天中国人民志愿军在敌人优势配备飞机大炮之下，却冲到敌人面前，迂回到敌人侧后，用轻武器来打坦克车，使美军无从抵抗，正是同一精神。为正义而斗争的战士向来是奋不顾身的！
    李如松的先世原是朝鲜人，移住辽东。因大兵尚未齐集，先带领西兵辽兵南兵四万人，于一五九三年二月六日进围平壤。这时蟠据平壤的是倭军精锐小西行长部队，朝鲜人觉得城坚守固，发愁“天兵（指明兵）亦人耳，恐未易拔也。”但中国军队奋勇争先，二月八日上午便光复了平壤。朝鲜人记载这天上午围攻的情况说：“诸军鳞次渐进，望见冰路马跑，飞屑杂尘，如白雾涨空。初日下射盔铠，银光灿烂，眩耀万状，奇怪夺目。贼亦于陴上多张五色旗帜，束长枪大刀，齐刃向外，为拒守计。提督领亲兵百余骑进薄城下，指挥将士。俄而发大炮一号，各阵继而齐发，响如万雷，山岳震摇。乱放火箭，烟焰弥数十里，咫尺不分。但闻呐喊声杂于炮响，如万蜂哄闹。”倭军从城上乱用铅丸汤水大石滚下，明军攻城“僵尸相续”。游击吴惟忠中丸伤胸，督战益力。参将骆尚志耸身攀堞，敌人扔下大石伤了他的脚。还拿着长戟，背着麻牌冒险直上，诸军鼓噪紧随，日军不能抵挡。两人当时都已年过六十。李如松也亲自督战，马中弹倒。我们再看首先登城的南兵将领游击钱世桢的回忆：“大呼而薄城下，倭奴铅子矢石雨注，前锋中伤者稍却。余拔刀斫其顶，遂鼓勇带伤而进。后队继至，呼声动天地。有一百总吴计会者，跃而超其陴，为贼所击而坠。复超而上，仰斫数人。余与家丁杨文奎徐大胜郭子明等已攀堞而登。遂克其城，时日尚未中。”入城之后继续巷战。日军避入民家，从屋内发枪。明军用火箭齐发焚薰，烧死甚多。余众“弃甲抛戈，惊乱遁走”。各地日军也都望风南逃。同时朝鲜各地人民纷纷起兵反抗，李舜臣的龟船舰队又在南部海上阻挡日本水军不能西去。日本侵略军队士气沮丧，粮食缺乏，于是退兵求和。一五九三年胜利的平壤之役起了决定性的作用。而在这次战役中，中国人民表现了高度的勇敢和对于朝鲜人民兄弟般的友谊！
    丰臣秀吉的求和条件非常苛刻，如割朝鲜八道土地的一半于日本，送朝鲜王子大臣为质等等，中国和朝鲜当然不能接受。于是一五九七年秀吉再度出兵。明朝也派陆军数路入朝抗击，配合朝鲜军队，陆续打败了日本侵略者。尤其中朝海军的团结合作，是最后把侵略者驱逐出去的主要原因。一五九八年冬天，小西行长在朝鲜南海岸顺天地方，被刘綎权栗所统中朝陆军包围。陈璘李舜臣又指挥中朝水军连连进攻，每次都得胜。相持数月，日军粮竭势窘。到十二月十五日，岛津义弘从泗川带五百只战船的庞大水军西来援救。夜半通过南海岛北面的露梁津时，中朝联合舰队突出围攻。左右掩击，矢石交下，柴火乱投。许多只日船被燃烧，不能支持，退入观音浦港内。但因无路可走，又折回来，这时已是十六日早晨。中朝战舰向前迎击，李舜臣的舰队前进指挥，被日船围住。陈璘连忙将船只赶上，冲入围中救援，结果也一起被困。陈璘命令下碇不动，鼓噪放大炮。等待日兵登船，将士奋起杀敌，日兵落水死者数千人。陈璘忽又摇铃收兵，敌军怀疑不解，稍稍退却。乘这时机，明军“从高散喷筒于贼船，风急火烈。贼船数百，顷刻焚烧，海波尽赤”。李舜臣因此突围而出，向敌军的大楼船进攻，射死主将一人。日船于是舍弃陈璘，来攻舜臣。陈璘得出，与舜臣军合。“发虎蹲炮，连碎贼船”。明朝副总兵七十岁老将邓子龙率领二百人直前奋击，明军的火器误投入子龙船，因而烧起。贼船乘势反攻，子龙力战而死。李舜臣见友军船起火，忙来赴救，追击日军。到中午倭兵大败，“烧溺俘斩殆尽，义弘等仅以余兵五十艘脱走”。小西行长也乘隙遁回本国，就这样结束了他们残酷而可耻的侵略罪行。朝鲜的民族英雄李舜臣在这次战役中壮烈牺牲，但他爱国的热忱，战斗的英勇，策略的周密，和团结中朝兄弟部队取得最后胜利的功劳，是两国人民友谊关系史上永远不能忘记的！
    中国人民支援朝鲜不仅是出兵作战，接济军用物资，并且进一步从根本上帮助，教朝鲜人训练兵士，制造武器。一五九二年冬天，朝鲜便已选择“精锐之士”跟骆尚志学习剑术。次年采用李如松建议，设立训练都监，用戚继光“纪效新书”的办法来训练兵士。柳成龙等亲自讨论，向中国将领质问疑难。并征集“武臣勇健有计虑者”隶属都监，学习《纪效新书》。又选精壮军丁四五十人，从明经略赞画刘黄裳学炮车战法。一五九五年，中国所派练兵教师十二人中，精于剑枪诸艺者三人留在汉城，监督诸军日夜学习。其余分派到各道，训练炮手、射手、杀手。至于武器方面，十四世纪末火炮之术已经从中国介绍入朝鲜。一五九三年因明军中百总周某通晓“造铳焰硝之法”，广求冶匠焰硝匠从他学习。又仿造刘綎所作铁鞭，传授了涂在箭上的毒药。击退倭寇之后，明军在义州等仓所遗留的米豆，悉数赠送给朝鲜人民。明军回国，还留下几千人帮助训练兵士，戍守要塞。此次前后用兵七年之久，军士的分布北方从蓟、保、辽、宣、大等五镇调来，南则南直隶、浙江、福建、广东、四川各省。还有西南苗族兵士一万五千人。粮饷是从辽东山东天津等地输运。军费用去数百万两。所以三百五十年前这次援朝抗日战争，是全中国人民的力量所支持的！史儒、邓子龙、钱世祯、李如松、陈璘等和全体死难、受伤以及作战的兵士，光荣地实现了广大中国人民对他们的希望。在学习新爱国主义和国际主义的今天，十六世纪中朝人民联合抗日保家卫国的战争，正是我们的一个好课题。
    丰臣秀吉侵略朝鲜失败之后三百年，日本统治阶级又作征服亚洲的迷梦，首当其冲的还是日本与亚洲大陆之间的桥梁——朝鲜半岛。当时李鸿章等人未始不知道日本对朝鲜的野心，以及种种侵略计划。但半殖民地国家统治阶级的投降主义糊涂思想，使得他们不敢正面积极支援朝鲜，抵抗日本。只是幻想倚赖帝俄英国出来劝和，或用武力干涉，自己缩在后面等待，“切勿多事”。然而中国的人民却很早就看准了日本的毒辣，认清楚中朝两国利害相同，中国应该及早帮助朝鲜来对付共同的敌人。例如姚锡光在一八八七年给李鸿章的密陈经画朝鲜说帖，便说“东三省南境与朝鲜犬牙相错，所恃为限带者，长白山而外，特鸭绿图门两江，然俱策马可涉。无朝鲜则东三省无日安枕。是朝鲜者东三省卧榻之侧，又即东三省屏蔽也。”，甲午战争时的舆论，从一八九五年所出版辑印当时新闻纸上论说的时事新编里，可以窥见一斑。有一篇《防倭论》指出日本侵朝是“假途伐虢之计”。又有一篇题为《呼吁篇》，申说朝鲜对中国关系之密切过于琉球：“琉球者中国之爪发也，高丽者中国之肘臂也。爪发虽属于人之身，割之截之，犹不甚惜。人岂有不惜其肘臂，而割之截之者乎？”接着说朝鲜与中国东三省毗连，日本若占据朝鲜，“以铁甲三四艘，游弋鸭绿江上下”，炮声殷殷，烽火历历，那时全中国人民还能“晏然高枕而卧，悉付之不见不闻矣乎？”又说全国人民“比闻牙山平壤之败，益皆奋袂攘臂，怒发冲冠，欲得外国人而甘心焉。”这些话都说明中国人民当时是和朝鲜人民站在一起，主张中国政府出兵抗击共同敌人日本侵略者。这种精神是十六世纪末年以来始终不变的，也是中朝人民深厚友谊的必然结果。
    一八九四年满清政府派兵到朝鲜，原是为了帮助朝鲜统治者，镇压朝鲜作反封建反帝斗争的人民——东学党。然而中国军队开到时，东学党已经暂时败退。中国军队并未参加镇压行为，相反地，却为保卫邻邦的国土，抗击中朝人民共同敌人而在朝鲜土地上流血。一八九四年七月牙山之战，中国军队以寡敌众。不但援军不到，而且缺军火，缺粮饷。“长夫不备，车驮无资，兵自负粮，枪无余弹”。在这种情况之下，武备学堂学生于光炘等四人曾于二十八日夜间纠合勇健兵士，冒雨埋伏桥旁村落，袭击进攻牙山东北成欢驿的日军前锋。颇有杀伤，并且打死日本军官数名。日军惊骇退却，过桥又多溺死。但因大队继续开来，中国方面接应不到，四人全都牺牲。九月十五日平壤之战，马玉昆自督步队截击东面日军，“肉薄血战，抵死相撑拒”。担任西南面的中国军队来加入作战，“枪弹雨发”。城东南角的炮台也发大炮轰击，日军伤亡甚重。从早晨六点钟到下午两点半钟，不能进展，只得退去。城北面由左宝贵防守，自己在城上指挥。日军死伤甚多，仍继续猛攻，占据了周围的小山同树林。十五日下午左宝贵正在指挥放一口最重的炮，忽然炮手中了弹，死在他身旁。这时他已经受了几处伤，可是他毫不畏缩，走上去自己放那炮。不料腿上又中了一弹，他很敏捷地用布将伤口裹好，勇敢地站起来继续鼓舞兵士作战。他的话还没有说完，又一弹打在他身上，这次却受了致命伤而倒地，扶下城便死去。部将也有数人一同炸死，平壤之战中国兵士一共牺牲了两千多人。这时中国军舰护送陆军增援朝鲜，九月十七日在鸭绿江口大东沟海上和日本海军会战。致远舰管带邓世昌鼓快车向日本四艘快船中速度最大的吉野舰撞去，中了鱼雷，船很快便沉没，全船二百五十人都溺死。邓世昌遇救出水，但因全船殉职，义不独生，仍奋掷自投于水而死。经远舰起火，管带林永升一面激水救火，一面发命追击负伤敌舰。也被水雷轰裂，二百七十人与船同尽。总计此次鸭绿江口的海战中国牺牲军官八十七人，水手一千多人，负伤四百多人。甲午战争期间，东学党在朝鲜国内向日本侵略军队继续进行武装斗争，日本费了很大兵力才镇压下去。详细情形虽因缺乏资料，无从考见，但我们确知中朝人民当时在不同的战场上抗拒同一敌人。由于投降主义者的满清统治阶级之腐败与无能，中国战士们光荣的战绩和壮烈的牺牲没能够扭转朝鲜的局面。但在中朝人民友好关系的历史上，在抵抗两国人民的共同敌人这一意义上，我们仍然不能忘记甲午之战牺牲了的先烈们！

    以上选择重点地回顾一下中朝人民的友谊关系和文化的交流。从这些事实中，我们知道两千年来中朝两国人民如何地利害相同，血肉相关。无论文化上、经济上、军事上，我们和朝鲜人民一向是互相依赖互相帮助的。在毛主席和金日成将军领导之下，在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中，亚洲这两个兄弟民族根据两千年来的友谊基础，将要全部肃清美帝侵略势力，永久地紧密团结互助合作下去！
    作者前在新建设第三卷第三期发表一篇《中国与朝鲜的历史关系》。当时掌握材料不够，看法也未能全面，所以对于中朝人民的友谊关系没有能充分表达出来。两个月来广泛搜集资料，重写此篇，对两千年来中朝人民的友谊关系与文化的交流作一回顾。希望读者批评指正，并盼已读前文者参看此篇，则作者幸甚。
