Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The China Peace Committee and the Red Cross Society of China issued a notice on February 3rd regarding the organization of medical teams. The full text is as follows:

　　In order to provide unified organization and leadership for medical personnel from all over the country who voluntarily sign up to participate in the Resisting America, Aiding Korea campaign, the China Peace Committee and the Red Cross Society of China have specially formulated the following measures for organizing medical teams across the country:

　　(1) The tasks of the medical team include treating the war wounds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, as well as providing medical care and epidemic prevention for Korean refugees.

　　(2) The organization of the medical team should be flexible. Each team should ideally consist of twelve people (one captain, one deputy captain, two doctors, two nurses, two assistant nurses, one lab technician, one pharmacist, one clerk, and one worker).

　　(3) Personnel participating in the medical team should possess a considerable level of technical proficiency (including experience in war wound surgery and epidemic prevention) so that they can solve problems to a certain extent during the medical process.

　　(4) Personnel participating in the medical team, if they have existing positions, their original work units should retain their positions and continue to pay them their due compensation on a monthly basis; if this cannot be provided by the original unit, or for medical personnel without existing work units, the Red Cross Society of China will be responsible for providing it.

　　(5) The service time for the medical team is tentatively set at three to six months. Personnel participating in the medical team, if they have no existing work unit, after the completion of the medical team's mission, if they wish to participate in work, the Red Cross Society of China will be responsible for assigning and recommending work.

　　(6) After the medical team is formed, the Red Cross Society of China will be responsible for supplying the required funds and medical supplies.

　　(7) After the medical team is formed (after replying by telegram to agree to the organization), first report to Beijing (except for the Northeast), where team numbers, flags, and distributed medicines will be given. Travel expenses from the original place to Beijing, if the original place cannot provide them, can be telegraphed for the required amount, which will be remitted by the Red Cross Society of China.

　　(8) In order to strengthen the power of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, it is hoped that each medical team can be quickly organized so that they can depart as soon as possible.
