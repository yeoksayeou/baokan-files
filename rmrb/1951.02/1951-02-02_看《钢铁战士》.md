　　Watching "Steel Warrior"
　　Mei Lingyi
　　The revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people, tempered into steel, are invincible and ever-victorious under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. During the land revolution war, it crushed the five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, victoriously completed the 25,000-li Long March, and led the war against Japan; in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, it persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines, crushed countless "sweeps" and "mopping-up operations," continuously struck at the ferocity of the Japanese invaders, inspired the victorious confidence of the entire Chinese people, and finally achieved a great victory; in the four-year war of liberation, it crushed the Chiang bandit army, which was fully supported by U.S. imperialism, basically liberated all of China, and achieved a world-shaking historic victory. Today, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have once again beaten the U.S. imperialist aggressors to a complete rout, changing the face of world history!
　　Why does the Chinese people's armed forces possess such power? One of the main factors is that almost all the soldiers, from the commander to the cook and the communication soldier, possess the resolute, brave, and tenacious spirit of dedication—a high degree of patriotism—as demonstrated by platoon leader Zhang Zhijian, cook Lao Wang, and communication soldier Xiao Liu in the movie "Steel Warrior." This spirit is not only the traditional spirit of the Chinese people, but also highly developed under the leadership and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party.
　　The movie "Steel Warrior" illustrates this spirit with specific events. It was back in 1946 when the Chiang bandit army launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Our army unit implemented Chairman Mao's strategic principle and temporarily retreated. Zhang Zhijian and his platoon were ordered to hide grain and machinery from the arsenal in a mountain gully, and then ordered to cover the retreat of the entire regiment. As the tasks were successively completed, they were surrounded by the enemy. After five days and five nights of fierce fighting, the Chiang bandit army suffered serious losses. Unfortunately, during the final breakout, Zhang Zhijian, Lao Wang, Xiao Liu, and a new soldier from a landlord background named Qi Degui were captured because they were injured. Under the enemy's torture and interrogation, except for Qi Degui, the three of them never bowed their heads. Lao Wang, who had been through the 25,000-li Long March, was old and sacrificed himself in prison; Xiao Liu, who was only over ten years old, was shot after seriously injuring an enemy officer. Zhang Zhijian experienced even more tests, refused all threats and inducements, and finally escaped and returned. These sons of the working people fully understand who the class enemy is, and know that there can be no compromise with the enemy; they also fully understand what the ultimate goal of the revolutionary war is, and in order to win victory, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own lives when necessary.
　　Are such examples accidental? No! If we can regard the heroic deeds of resisting the enemy, defending the territory, and sacrificing oneself for the country throughout history as a concentrated manifestation of patriotism, then this is the continuation and development of the excellent traditional spirit of the Chinese nation. Kalinin said: "The propaganda of Soviet patriotism must not be divorced from the past history of our people, and must not be without a direct connection to this history." (Youth Publishing House edition: "On Communist Education," page 77) However, patriotism in history was limited by the social system at the time and often had a tragic end, as exemplified by Yue Fei. Only in the new society of people's democracy can the people's patriotism be fully developed, especially in the struggle led by the Communist Party's armed forces to liberate the people (liberate themselves). Today, thousands upon thousands of revolutionary soldiers, like Zhang Zhijian, Lao Wang, and Xiao Liu in "Steel Warrior," possess a high degree of class consciousness and determination.
　　The movie "Steel Warrior" mainly expresses the spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's heroic dedication and unyielding spirit in the struggle for the liberation of the people—a high degree of patriotism. This spirit infects and educates us through artistic images. Look, Zhang Zhijian is so brave in accepting tasks, so determined in completing tasks, so unyielding in the face of the enemy, and so willing to sacrifice himself for the people…Can he not be our role model? Not only is this needed in the fight against the enemy on the front lines, but it is also needed in all positions of work: forget personal interests, dedicate oneself to work without reservation, and persevere in the most difficult times! This is the concrete content of patriotism!
　　"Steel Warrior" is Comrade Cheng Yin's second work after "Returning to His Own Ranks." This work is adapted from the original work "Steel Ribs" by Comrades Wu Zhaodi, Su Li, and Wu Yin. Whether in terms of ideological depth or the artistic achievement of embodying the ideological content, it is clearly better than the previous work. He more skillfully used the unique performance of the film form to express the character of the characters, thereby powerfully expressing the theme. Zhang Ping, who plays Zhang Zhijian, Du Defu, who plays Lao Wang, Sun Yu, who plays Xiao Liu, and other actors also very well understood the characters in the play. The progress of the screenwriters, actors, and other departments is the progress of the people's film.
　　Editor's Note: This film is scheduled to premiere in Beijing on February 2nd.

### 看《钢铁战士》

　　看《钢铁战士》
    梅令宜
    百炼成钢的中国人民的革命武装力量，在毛主席、中国共产党的领导下，是战无不胜，攻无不克的。在土地革命战争时期，它粉碎了蒋介石匪帮的五次“围剿”，胜利完成了二万五千里长征，领导抗日；在八年抗日战争中，它坚持敌后抗战，粉碎了无数次的“扫荡”和“清剿”，不断打击了日寇的凶焰，鼓舞了全中国人民的胜利信心，最后取得了伟大的胜利；在四年解放战争中，它粉碎了由美帝国主义全力支持的蒋匪军，基本上解放了全中国，取得了震动世界的历史性胜利。今天，我国人民志愿军跟朝鲜人民军一起又把美帝国主义侵略军打得落花流水，改变了世界历史的面貌！
    为什么中国人民的武装力量具有这样的威力呢？主要的因素之一就是：几乎所有的战士，从司令员到炊事员和通讯员，都具备着像电影《钢铁战士》中的排长张志坚和炊事员老王和通讯员小刘所表现的那样坚决、勇敢、顽强的献身的精神——高度的爱国主义精神。这精神，不仅是中国人民的传统精神，而且是在中国共产党的领导与培育之下得到高度发展的。
    电影《钢铁战士》以具体事件说明了这种精神。那还是一九四六年蒋匪军大举进攻解放区的时候，我军某部执行毛主席的战略原则，暂时撤退。张志坚和他的一排人奉命把粮食和兵工厂机器隐藏在山沟里，跟着又奉命掩护全团撤退。在任务相继完成之际，他们被敌人包围了。经过五日五夜的激战，蒋匪军受了严重的损失。不幸，在最后突围中，张志坚、老王和小刘，还有一个地主阶级出身的新战士齐得贵，因为受伤被俘了。在敌人的非刑审问之下，除了齐得贵之外，他们三个始终没有低头。经过二万五千里长征的老王年岁大了，牺牲在牢狱中；仅仅十多岁的小刘在重伤了敌军官后被枪杀了。张志坚则经历了更多的考验，拒绝了一切威胁利诱，终于脱险回来。这些劳动人民的子弟，完全明白谁是阶级的敌人，知道和敌人不可能有一分妥协；他们也完全明白革命战争的最后目的是什么，为了赢得胜利，在必要的时候，不惜献出自己的生命。
    这样的事例是偶然的吗？不！如果我们可以把历史上的抗敌守土、以身殉国的英雄伟绩看成爱国主义的集中表现，那么，这就是中国民族的优良传统精神的继续和发展。加里宁说：“宣传苏维埃爱国主义，这决不能与我国人民过去的历史脱离，决不能与这历史没有连蒂关系。”（青年出版社版：《论共产主义教育》，第七七页）但是，历史上的爱国主义曾受到了当时社会制度的限制，往往有一个悲剧的结束，岳飞即是一例。只有在人民民主的新社会中，人民的爱国主义才可能得到充分的发展，特别是在共产党所领导的武装力量进行解放人民（解放自己）的斗争中。今天成千成万的革命战士，都像《钢铁战士》中的张志坚、老王和小刘一样，具有高度的阶级觉悟与决心。
    电影《钢铁战士》主要是表现中国人民解放军的为人民解放斗争英勇献身、威武不屈的精神——高度的爱国主义的精神，这种精神通过艺术形象，感染着、教育着我们。看，张志坚是那样的勇于接受任务，那样坚决的完成任务，那样刚强的在敌人面前毫不动摇，那样的为了人民不惜牺牲自己……能够不是我们的榜样吗？不但在火线上的对敌斗争中需要这样，在一切岗位的工作中，也需要这样：忘掉个人的利害，毫无保留的献身工作，在最困难的时候坚持下去！这就是爱国主义的具体内容！
    《钢铁战士》是成荫同志继《回到自己队伍来》的第二部作品。这一作品是根据武兆堤、苏里、吴茵三同志的原著《钢筋铁骨》编成的，无论在思想深度上，在体现思想内容的艺术成就上，显然都比前一部作品好。他更熟练的运用了电影这一形式所特有的性能来表现人物的性格，从而有力的表现了主题思想。饰张志坚的张平，饰老王的杜德夫，饰小刘的孙羽，以及其他演员们，也很好的体会了剧中人的性格。编导、演员以及其他部门工作者的进步，就是人民电影的进步。
    编者按：此片定于二月二日在北京开始公演。
