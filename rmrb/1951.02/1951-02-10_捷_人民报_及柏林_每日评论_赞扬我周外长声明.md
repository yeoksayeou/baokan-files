Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 9th. The Czechoslovak "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 6th, commenting on the statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the illegal passage of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly that slandered our country, saying: "Those who are indignant at the American trick are filled with hope and sympathy after reading this statement. The words of this Chinese statesman are powerful, just, and peaceful. People's China wants peace and justice. It is not afraid of threats, and even less afraid of despicable intimidation and sanctions."

The newspaper continued: "Only those who are releasing fascist aggressors would declare the peace-loving Chinese people as 'aggressors.' Only the insidious and greedy Wall Street financial tycoons and a handful of lackeys are obstacles to achieving a just and lasting peace. Today, the people of Asia, Europe, and even America understand this."

The newspaper concluded: "Only the just peace proposals of the People's Republic of China can bring justice and a peaceful resolution to the Asian issue, and strengthen peace throughout the world. The universal indignation at the shameless resolution of the United Nations shows how strong the desire for a just peace is, and this desire will eventually triumph."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th. The Berlin "Daily Review" published an editorial on the 6th titled "The Mask of the Slanderer is Unveiled," commenting on the statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the illegal passage of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly that slandered our country, stating: "The United States government does not want peace in Korea, but wants to drag the people of China and the entire Asian continent into war." The editorial continued: No one can deny, not even reactionary politicians, "that the People's Republic of China has done everything possible to quickly end the Korean War. But Washington is doing its best to prevent the acceptance of China's peace proposals. ... Peace-loving people, especially the people of Asia, have long recognized that conquering Korea is only part of the Far East policy of American imperialism. The American proposal only adds another example to this understanding. Zhou Enlai's reply exposed these plans of American imperialism. ... Even reactionary Western politicians have to admit that the passage of the slanderous American proposal by the United Nations is by no means a victory for the United States. Not only did the delegations of countries with a population of 1.4 billion vote against the American proposal or abstain, but the attempt to get the so-called 'Intervention Committee' to take action has also failed, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone willing to serve the American plan to invade the Far East. All of this is enough to prove that the prestige of the United States is declining on the international stage, while the respect of other countries for China is constantly growing."

　　捷“人民报”及柏林“每日评论”
    赞扬我周外长声明
    【新华社布拉格九日电】捷克斯洛伐克“人民报”六日发表社论，评论我国周外长对联合国大会非法通过诬蔑我国决议所发表的声明称：“对美国诡计感到愤慨的人们在读了这个声明后，充满了希望和同情。这位中国政治家的话是强有力的、公正的及和平的。人民中国要和平及正义。它不怕威胁，更不怕卑鄙的吓诈和制裁。”
    该报继续说：“只有那些在释放着法西斯侵略者的人们，才会宣布爱好和平的中国人民为“侵略者”。只有阴险而贪婪的华尔街财阀和一小撮奴仆，才是妨碍获得公正持久和平的障碍。今天亚洲、欧洲甚至美洲的人民都明白这一点了。”
    该报结语说：“唯有中华人民共和国的公正的和平建议，能够带来正义和亚洲问题的和平解决，并加强全世界的和平。对联合国无耻决议的普遍愤慨，显示要求公正和平的意愿是多么强大，这个意愿终必获得胜利。”
    【新华社柏林九日电】柏林“每日评论”报六日以“诽谤者的假面具被揭穿了”为题发表社论，评论我国周外长就联合国大会非法通过诬蔑我国决议一事的声明称：“美国政府不要朝鲜和平，而想把中国与整个亚洲大陆的人民都卷入战争。”社论继称：没有人能否认，甚至反动的政客也不能否认，“中华人民共和国已竭尽一切的可能来迅速结束朝鲜战争。但是华盛顿却竭力阻止接受中国的和平建议。……爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲人民，早已认识征服朝鲜只是美帝国主义的远东政策的一部分。美国的提案只是在这种认识之上增加一个例子。周恩来的答复揭穿了美帝国主义的这些计划。……甚至反动的西方政客也不得不承认联合国通过诽谤性的美国提案，绝非美国的胜利。不仅拥有十四亿人民的国家的代表团都投票反对美国的提案或者弃权，而且想使所谓‘干旋委员会’行动起来的企图也没有成功，因为要想找到任何愿意替美国侵略远东计划服务的人，已经愈来愈困难了。所有这一切都足以证明美国在国际舞台上的声望正在下降，而其他各国人民对于中国的尊敬正在不断增长。”
