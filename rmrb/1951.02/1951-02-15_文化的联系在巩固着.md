　　Cultural Ties are Being Consolidated
　　Film Director, Honored Artist, Stalin Prize Winner Π·瓦尔拉莫夫
    Only a year has passed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, but what a beneficial impact it has had on the further development and consolidation of the long-standing traditional friendship between our two great nations! The entire Soviet people welcomed the signing of this historic document with great excitement. This document has further expanded our ties in all areas of economy, culture, and art. The treaty has promoted the expansion of trade between our two countries, it has promoted a deeper mutual understanding and cultural cooperation between the working people of China and the Soviet Union.
    It has been many months since our film crew stayed in friendly China and finished work on the film "The Victory of the Chinese People." But can all the memories and impressions of China that remain in our memory and live in our hearts be fully expressed in words?
    We were constantly cared for, and we were given all kinds of help and assistance, because our Chinese friends regarded us as loyal and selfless friends of the Chinese people. I often recall with deep gratitude and affection those young Chinese filmmakers who worked with us to produce the film about the heroic victory of the Chinese people. I would like to express my regards on behalf of myself and our entire team to comrades Wu Benli, Liu Baiyu, Su Li, and other friends, with whom we shared all the joys and difficulties in the production of this great film.
    We are honored that the film "The Victory of the Chinese People," which we created in collaboration with Chinese film workers, has been warmly welcomed by the Soviet public. Soviet audiences watched the film with great interest and satisfaction. This film, as Soviet newspapers pointed out, "demonstrates the victory of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and demonstrates the Chinese people's love for the Soviet Union." The film "The Victory of the Chinese People" helped the working people of socialist countries to understand more and more deeply the truth about the Chinese people's selfless anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. It made our audience have greater friendship, sympathy and love for our great neighbor, China.
    The victories of the new China in implementing land reform and national industrialization have brought it great progress. It has only been about a year and a half since the founding of the People's Republic of China, but the hundreds of millions of people in this country have definitely changed, they have been freed from the oppression of the Kuomintang bandits and their masters - imperialism.
    We Soviet artists are very happy to hear reports about the increasing number of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the beneficial work it is doing.
    We Soviet artists should use all means to help expand this respectable and noble work. The exchange performances of Soviet and Chinese actors, the screening of films, the organization of art exhibitions and visits of various delegations will promote more and deeper understanding between our two great nations.
    Soviet filmmakers and cultural workers who have been to China will never forget the kindness shown to them by the Chinese people, who thereby expressed their deep love and gratitude to their great friend, the leader of all advanced humanity, Stalin!

　　文化的联系在巩固着
    电影导演、功勋艺术工作者、斯大林奖金获奖人　Π·瓦尔拉莫夫
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订至今只有一年，但它对于进一步发展和巩固我们两大民族间的多年传统友谊已经发生了多么有益的影响啊！全苏联人民曾怀着高度的兴奋心情欢迎这一历史性文件的签字。这一文件，使我们在所有经济、文化和艺术各个领域里的联系，都更为扩展了。这个条约促成了我们两国间贸易的扩大，它促进了中国和苏联劳动人民的更深的相互了解和文化上的合作。
    从我们的电影队留居在对我们友好的中国，和结束关于影片《中国人民的胜利》的工作到现在，已经有好多月了。但是，留在我们记忆里和活在我们心里的全部关于中国的回忆和印象，难道能够用言语表达得完吗？
    我们被经常地照顾关怀，我们被给予各种帮忙和协助，因为中国朋友们把我们看作是中国人民的忠诚无私的朋友。我常常怀着深深的感谢与同情的情感，回想起那些和我们一道摄制关于中国人民英勇胜利的影片的年青的中国电影工作者。我愿代表我自己和我们全队向吴本立、刘白羽、苏黎等同志及其他朋友们致意，我们同他们在摄制这个巨大影片中分享了一切的快乐，也分担了一切的困难。
    我们感到很荣幸，我们同中国电影工作者们协力创作的《中国人民的胜利》这部影片，得到苏联公众的热烈欢迎。苏联观众们以巨大的兴趣和满意的心情观看这部影片。这部影片，正如苏联报纸指出的，“表明着马克思列宁主义的伟大思想的胜利，表明着中国人民对于苏联的热爱”。《中国人民的胜利》这部影片帮助了社会主义国家的劳动者们更多并更深刻地了解中国人民的忘我的反帝、反封建斗争的实情。使得我国观众们对自己伟大的邻居——中国怀抱着更大的友谊同情和热爱。
    新中国在实行土地改革和国家工业化中的胜利，已使它获得了巨大的进展。从中华人民共和国成立之时起，总共不过一年半左右，但是这个国家的亿万人民是确切地改变了，他们摆脱了国民党匪帮及其主子——帝国主义——的压迫。
    我们苏维埃艺术工作者们，听到关于不断增加的中苏友好协会会员的数目以及它所进行的有益的工作的报导，感到非常的欢欣。
    我们苏维埃艺术工作者们应当用一切方法来帮助扩展这一可敬的崇高的工作。苏联和中国演员们交换演出，放映电影，组织艺术展览以及各种代表团的访问，将会促进我们两大民族间的更多和更深刻的认识。
    到过中国的苏联电影工作者和文化工作者，将永不忘记中国人民对他们所表现的亲切，中国人民并以此而对他们的伟大朋友，全体先进人类的领袖斯大林表示自己的深深的爱戴和感谢！
