Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th: The Soviet Government's reply to the note of the British Government.

On February 17 this year, Strang, Permanent Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, delivered to Soviet Ambassador to Britain Zarubin a reply from the British Government to the Soviet Government's note of January 20 this year. The Soviet note concerned the British Government's violation of the Anglo-Soviet "Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and Her Associates in Europe and of Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter" signed by the two countries on May 26, 1942.

On February 24, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received British Ambassador Kelly and delivered to the British Ambassador the Soviet Government's reply to the aforementioned British note.

The original text of the Soviet Government's note is as follows:

Note of the Soviet Government, February 24, 1951.

"Regarding the British Government's note of February 17, 1951, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby declares as follows: In its note of January 20 this year, the Soviet Government cited irrefutable evidence proving that the British Government violated the responsibilities stipulated in the Anglo-Soviet 'Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and Her Associates in Europe and of Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter' signed by the two countries on May 26, 1942. Unable to refute this evidence, the British Government, in its note of February 17, resorted to fabrication and slander in an attempt to portray the British Government's aggressive policy as a policy of peace and the Soviet Union's policy of peace as a policy of aggression. However, this attempt to evade answering questions about fulfilling treaty obligations has failed, because facts have proven that Britain has violated the treaty and committed the crime of pursuing a policy of aggression, pursuing a policy of instigating war, and not pursuing a policy of maintaining peace.

	Britain Has Embarked on the Road of Sabotaging Cooperation and Undermining the Treaty Since 1946

	(1) The Soviet Government cannot but reiterate the Anglo-Soviet responsibilities regarding the German question as stated in the Anglo-Soviet treaty of 1942.

	Article 3 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty stipulates: "The High Contracting Parties declare their desire to unite with other like minded States in adopting proposals for common action to preserve peace and resist aggression in the post-war Period.

	Pending adoption of such proposals, they will after the termination of the war take all measures in their power to render impossible a repetition of aggression and violation of peace by Germany or any of the States associated with her in acts of aggression in Europe."

	Therefore, the first part of Article 3 of the treaty stipulates that both contracting parties should implement a policy of cooperation on all issues related to preventing aggression—including the German question.

	However, since 1946, Britain has embarked on a different path, namely, the path of sabotaging cooperation and undermining the treaty.

	It suffices to cite a few examples of unilateral actions taken by the British Government on the German question to illustrate this point. For example, in 1946, the British Government took unilateral action to merge the British and American occupation zones in Germany, and subsequently the French occupation zone was also merged with the previous two zones, resulting in Germany being split into two parts; the British Government issued special currency in West Germany, resulting in the destruction of Germany's economic unity and the dissolution of the Four-Power Control Council; the British Government took unilateral action to establish the Bonn government in West Germany, thus creating various obstacles to the restoration of Germany's national unity; the splitters refused to prepare a peace treaty with Germany and forcibly implemented occupation statutes in West Germany for indefinite occupation.

	All these measures were implemented unilaterally, without cooperation with the Soviet Union and without Soviet participation. Therefore, it is Britain, not the Soviet Union, that abandoned the policy of cooperation on the German question, thereby violating the provisions of Article 3 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty.

	Britain Violates Treaty and International Agreement Obligations, Revives German Militarism

	(2) The second part of Article 3 of the treaty stipulates: Both contracting parties should take all measures to make it impossible for Germany to re-engage in aggression and violation of peace. The Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, fully in accordance with this spirit, stipulated on the German question that the countries participating in the conference should strictly adhere to the policy of eradicating German militarism and democratizing Germany.

	However, the British Government's policy is completely contrary to this policy. Instead of starting to democratize Germany, Britain is re-employing fascist leaders and gradually fascistizing West Germany; after Krupp was released from prison, the British Government restored Krupp and his imperialist partners' power in the Ruhr area, and re-appointed well-known fascist generals of the Hitler gang to important positions, and in the past suppressed, and continues to suppress, democratic and peace-loving people in West Germany. At the same time, instead of eradicating German militarism, the British Government has begun to restore Germany's war industry, and after turning the Ruhr into a base for the war industry, has begun to rebuild German regular troops led by Nazi generals, and has begun to turn West Germany into a bridgehead for a new war of aggression.

	The British Government has taken these measures in the past and is taking them now, ignoring the repeated protests of the Soviet Government and violating the provisions of the second part of Article 3 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty.

	Therefore, Britain has definitely violated its obligations to prevent the revival of German militarism, to democratize Germany, and to eradicate German militarism, thereby undermining the foundations of the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Yalta and Potsdam agreements.

	Britain Violates Treaty by Establishing Anti-Soviet "Western European Union" and North Atlantic Group

	(3) The Soviet Government also deems it necessary to once again draw the British Government's attention to another part of the Anglo-Soviet treaty, which stipulates that Britain and the Soviet Union shall not participate in any alliance aimed at opposing the other contracting party.

	Article 7 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty stipulates: "Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to conclude any alliance nor take part in any coalition directed against the other High Contracting Party."

	As for the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government has strictly adhered to this obligation. None of the treaties signed by the Soviet Government are directed against Britain or any ally in the war against Hitlerite Germany. The Soviet Union has never participated in any anti-British alliance, past or present. All treaties signed by the Soviet Union with other European countries, like the Anglo-Soviet treaty, are aimed at consolidating peace in Europe, preventing the revival of German militarism, and preventing the resurgence of German aggression.

	Although the Soviet Government has strictly adhered to its obligations in the past and present, the British Government has openly disregarded the obligations it undertook under the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The British Government, together with the French Government, jointly proposed the establishment of the so-called "Western European Union," which, from the very beginning, did not conceal its hostility towards the Soviet Union. Subsequently, Britain and the United States established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; among the major countries that formed the anti-Hitler alliance, only the Soviet Union was not listed as a signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty. In this situation, the various arguments that the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group are defensive are untenable. Moreover, facts have proven that the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group are aimed directly against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

	Currently, the aggressive nature of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group has been completely exposed. All the declarations made by these groups, headed by the British and American countries, regarding defensive purposes, lose their meaning after these groups strive to pull West Germany, as well as the revanchist Bonn government and the West German army led by the Hitler gang generals, into these groups.

	Ignoring the statement made by the Soviet Government in its note of January 20 this year, the British Government, like the American and French governments, is currently engaged in organizing a military alliance with West Germany against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The British Government did not dare to deny this statement of the Soviet Government, because if it did so, it could not but contradict the obvious and well-known facts.

	Since the British Government has helped rebuild the German regular army and the German war industry, and is embarking on the road of forming a direct military alliance with the revanchist government of West Germany, it has thereby crudely trampled on the Anglo-Soviet treaty.

	Britain Slanders the People of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, Attempting to Make These Countries Follow Britain's Aggressive Policy

	(4) In its note of February 17, the British Government crudely slanders the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, which have established democratic regimes and permanently eliminated the remnants of fascism. The British Government obviously hopes to see governments in these countries that are willing to follow Britain's aggressive policy. However, the British Government should now understand that the people of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania have the same rights as the people of any other country to handle their own internal affairs according to their national interests, regardless of whether the democratic regimes established in these countries are liked by a certain foreign government.

	Everyone knows that the British Government is trying to use forceful means to restore fascists and other aggressors in the peace-loving democratic countries of Eastern Europe, encouraging the hostile activities of fascist groups in these countries, whose goal is to organize conspiracies to overthrow the people's democratic regimes.

	In its note of February 17, the British Government attempts to portray itself as a defender of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and says that the Soviet Union has interfered in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, or Greece, but in view of the above facts, it can be proved that these attempts are absurd.

	The British Government has also made similar slanders against the reorganization of the Czechoslovak government in February 1948. The British Government tried to insist that this reorganization was a coup that threatened peace. However, everyone knows that the reorganization occurred because, under the instigation of American and other foreign agents (including the official diplomatic representatives of the United States), someone was preparing to launch a coup in Czechoslovakia, with the aim of depriving the Czechoslovak people of their national independence and making Czechoslovakia obedient to the British and American powers.

	The Soviet Union submitted a written proposal to the United Nations Security Council against the so-called investigation in Czechoslovakia—the British Government mentioned this proposal in its note—the Soviet Union thus fulfilled its responsibilities, safeguarded the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia, and prevented acts that directly violated the United Nations Charter, which prohibits the organization from interfering in the internal affairs of various countries.

	Secondly, the Soviet Government believes that the British Government's attempt to pose as a protector of the national interests of Yugoslavia is an absurd thing. The Soviet people condemn and will continue to condemn the current Yugoslav rulers, because these rulers have established a fascist regime in their country like the Franco regime in Spain, and deprived the Yugoslav people of basic democratic rights. The Soviet people condemn and will continue to condemn the Yugoslav rulers, because these rulers organized conspiracies against the Hungarian People's Democratic Government, thus becoming the deadly enemy of the people's democratic countries. As for the national interests of Yugoslavia, it is not the Soviet Union that threatens it, but the current rulers of Yugoslavia. The sons and daughters of the Soviet Union shed much blood to liberate the Yugoslav people from German occupation and to guarantee Yugoslavia's independence. However, the current rulers of Yugoslavia, in all their policies, strive to subordinate the national interests of the Yugoslav people to the interests of their British and American masters.

	The British Government, like the American and French governments, cannot escape its responsibility for delaying the signing of the Austrian peace treaty, and it will not succeed in trying to shirk this responsibility onto the Soviet Union.

	Now is the time to end the indecisive discussion of the unagreed clauses in the treaty, and most importantly, Britain and the United States must now abandon their plan to turn Austria into a military base in the heart of Europe, just as they destroyed the treaty they signed with Italy in Trieste.

	Britain Slanders China and North Korea as "Aggressors," but the United States and Britain Sent Troops to Invade Korea

	(5) In its note of February 17, the British Government crudely attacked the Korean people and the People's Republic of China, slanderously accusing them of being aggressors. However, everyone understands very well that the Korean people are carrying out a struggle for liberation for the unification of their country and are not interfering in the affairs of other countries. Similarly, everyone knows that the People's Republic of China is defending its legitimate national interests, safeguarding its rights to the Chinese island of Taiwan, and defending the Chinese border from aggression by British and American troops, who have broken into Korea and threatened the security of the Chinese border. China and North Korea, which are defending their national interests and territory, are not aggressors. The aggressors are the United States and Britain, which sent troops from their own countries to Korean territory thousands of kilometers away. These troops have been destroying towns and villages in Korea, looting the Korean people, raping Korean women, and killing Korean children and old people for many months.

	The Soviet Government also believes that the section in the British note mentioning the liberation movements in Malaya, Indochina, and other countries is not serious and absurdly ridiculous. This section accuses the Soviet Government of expressing sympathy for the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples of various countries, which violates the Anglo-Soviet treaty. What the British note refers to as communist imperialism is equally unserious and absurd. This is clearly copied from the dictionaries of Hitler and Mussolini. First, the Anglo-Soviet treaty only includes European countries and does not involve non-European countries such as Malaya and Vietnam. Second, as is well known, no clause in the Anglo-Soviet treaty prohibits anyone from expressing sympathy for the liberation movements of any country. Third, it must be stated that as long as imperialist oppression exists in the world, the liberation movements of the oppressed nations will inevitably exist, regardless of whether certain rulers or others are willing or sympathetic. Imperialist oppression has aroused liberation movements in various countries, and accusing the Soviet Government on this ground is as absurd as accusing the Soviet Government on the ground that earthquakes or tides occur in the world.

	Britain's Acceptance of the Marshall Plan Has Turned It into a Servant of the United States

	(6) The British Government's note insists that the Soviet Government, by voicing its opposition to the Marshall Plan, has hindered the economic recovery of European countries. This is absolutely wrong. The Soviet Government's opposition to the Marshall Plan is not because it provides financial assistance to certain countries, but mainly because the economic assistance from the United States is conditional on these countries abandoning their economic and political independence and abandoning their sovereignty. Britain has become subordinate to the United States, it is increasingly losing its independence, and it is being transformed into a military base for the American army, because it cannot get the so-called Marshall Plan assistance without doing so. It should be said that the situation in France, Belgium, Turkey, and other so-called Marshallized countries is the same.

	We must also not ignore the fact that the United States government is using the Marshall Plan and incidental financial handouts to certain countries to undermine legitimate international trade relations by all illegal means, and is imposing discriminatory systems on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries that resolutely defend their own legitimate economic interests and refuse others to interfere in their internal affairs.

	The British note even talks about maintaining the prestige of the United Nations, accusing the Soviet government of not wanting to follow in everything those who impolitely control this international organization, in which people still placed some hope not long ago. However, everyone can see very clearly that the Soviet Union is in no way responsible for the unsatisfactory situation in the United Nations.

	Even more absurd is that the British government attempts to push the responsibility for "strikes and social unrest" onto the Soviet Union, or blame it all on the Cominform, that is, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties that has existed in Europe since 1947. The clumsy methods used in the British note are simply inexplicable, and we can only say that this is probably due to the hasty drafting of the note. Because, who in Britain does not know that "strikes and social unrest" existed not only long before our own era and before the establishment of the Cominform, but also long before our generation.

	Britain Distorts the Facts of Soviet Demobilization and Exaggerates the Size of the Soviet Army to Find an Excuse for British Arms Expansion

	(7) The British Government's note this time no longer insists on Prime Minister Attlee's well-known slander that the Soviet Union did not demobilize its troops after the war. This note has realized the absolute absurdity of Prime Minister Attlee's statement, so it also believes that there is no reason to doubt that the Soviet army did not demobilize after the war.

	However, the note then goes on to say that the Soviet government only demobilized a part of the maximum wartime service personnel. This statement in the British note is a slander against the Soviet Union. In fact, the Soviet government has basically and massively demobilized its army. It has completed the demobilization of thirty-three levels of age personnel. No country needs large-scale demobilization more than the Soviet Union, because without millions of demobilized personnel returning to farms and factories, the Soviet Union would not have the strength to organize its post-war economic progress, nor would it have the strength to restore the areas, towns, railways, industries, and agriculture destroyed by the German occupiers. Only those who intend to slander the Soviet Union can deny these facts.

	The British note also says that the current Soviet army, in terms of numbers, exceeds the total number of the armies of all Western European countries. This statement is also a slander against the Soviet Union. At present, the number of Soviet armed forces, including the army, navy, and air force, is equal to the number of Soviet armed forces before the outbreak of the Second World War (that is, in 1939).

	However, the three signatories to the North Atlantic aggressive pact alone—the United States, Britain, and France—currently have more than five million armed forces in the army, air force, and navy. The armed forces of these three countries are continuing to increase rapidly. At the same time, the industries of these countries have been mobilized to further expand military production. The reason why we call the armies of these three countries one army is mainly because the armies of these three countries are no longer three independent armies. They have been united by the American military and commanded by the American general Eisenhower.

	It should be pointed out here that the number of this armed force of Britain, France, and the United States is several times higher than the number they had in 1939 before the Second World War, and more than twice the number of the existing Soviet armed forces. Why do the armed forces of Britain, the United States, and France need to maintain this advantage, which is more than twice the size of the Soviet armed forces? Of course, this is not to prevent possible aggression by Germany and Japan. The British note does not deny that these countries are mainly preparing to deal with the Soviet Union under certain circumstances.

	Therefore, the British government's claim that the Soviet armed forces are numerically superior to the total number of Western armed forces is a misleading slander, the purpose of which is to mislead public opinion, thereby finding an excuse for Britain's arms expansion movement.

	But from here it can be understood: Since Britain, the United States, and France have surpassed the Soviet Union in armed forces by a factor of two and are still trying to expand their own armed forces, they are not preparing for defense, but for aggression, preparing to launch a new world war.

	Britain Claims in Its Note That It Has No Hostility Towards the Soviet Union, but in Fact It Intentionally Slanders the Soviet Union

	(8) The Soviet government has no reason to doubt that among the British people, not only at the end of the war, but also at present, there is a general goodwill towards the Soviet Union, which is completely natural, not only because the Soviet people created outstanding achievements in defending their motherland against Hitler's aggression, but also because the Soviet people provided a decisive contribution in the cause of striving for victory in the common defeat of Hitlerism. This has also been acknowledged to some extent in the British note. On the part of the Soviet people, they have always harbored, and still continue to harbor, friendship and gratitude towards the British people, just as they harbor friendship and gratitude towards the people of all countries who once defended their freedom and worked together with the Soviet people to strive for an early end to the war and the elimination of Hitlerism.

	However, the Soviet Government does not believe that the British note, which claims that the British Government seems to have firmly and unwaveringly sought cooperation with the Soviet Union, is justified. It may be recalled here that as early as 1944, at the Labor Party's annual conference, the current ruling Labor Party leaders passed a resolution prohibiting Labor Party members from participating in the work of British social organizations aimed at strengthening Anglo-Soviet friendship. Even the people of the Conservative Party had not thought of such an openly hostile idea towards the Soviet Union.

	From this, the conclusion can be drawn that when the British government could not do without the Soviet Union in order to defeat Hitlerite Germany, it somewhat suppressed its opposition to the Soviet Union and suppressed its hostile attitude towards the Soviet state. However, seeing the movement of the British people striving for friendship with the Soviet people growing day by day, the Labor Party leaders showed unease even before the end of the war, as soon as the defeat of Hitlerite Germany was evident, and immediately took measures to weaken the friendly relations between the British people and the Soviet people. This alone is enough to explain why the Labor Party conference in 1944 passed a resolution stipulating that those who participate in the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association shall not participate in the Labor Party. This shameful resolution was repeatedly reaffirmed at subsequent Labor Party conferences—already after the war—which was not accidental. Not only that, but in recent years, the Labor Party leaders and Conservative Party leaders have directed a vicious anti-Soviet slander campaign, which is being artificially encouraged and instigated frequently in this country.

	In view of the above facts, the British note says that it seems that the British government has no hostility towards the Soviet Union, but is striving to develop cooperation between the British and Soviet people, and that it seems that this effort has been hindered because the Soviet government does not have such a desire, and it is said that the Soviet government wants to isolate the Soviet people from the outside world. Such a statement is intentionally concealing the truth from its own people and is intentionally making a shameless slander against the Soviet Union.

	The British government is no longer concerned with consolidating international peace, it has now linked its fate with an unrestrained arms expansion movement and reckless new war propaganda; the Soviet government is obviously different from the British government, it still adheres to its peace-loving position. The Soviet government and the entire Soviet society educate the Soviet people every day in the spirit of strengthening international friendship, in the spirit of upholding the cause of peace and preventing new wars, and by exposing the conspiracies of warmongers. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government believes that it is extremely important to faithfully abide by the Anglo-Soviet treaty and to strictly abide by the Yalta and Potsdam agreements on the German question, especially when violations of these agreements seriously undermine the cause of maintaining peace.

	The Soviet Union Does Not Have Full Confidence in the British Government's Statement, but Is Still Willing to Negotiate with Britain and Strive to Use All Opportunities to Improve Relations with Britain

	(9) In its note, the British Government expressed its willingness to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union in the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, in order to improve the relations between the two countries in the long term. Due to the above-mentioned points, the Soviet government does not have full confidence in the British government's statement. But the Soviet government is still willing to participate in such negotiations in order to strive to use all opportunities to improve relations with Britain.

	The Soviet government will attach great importance to any steps taken by the British government that are truly aimed at improving its relations with our country."

　　斥责英国破坏英苏条约
    苏联政府对英国政府照会复文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：苏联政府对英国政府照会的复文。
    今年二月十七日，英国外交部常务次官斯特朗以英国政府对于苏联政府今年一月二十日照会的复文一件，送交苏联驻英大使查鲁宾，苏联的照会是关于英国政府违反英苏两国在一九四二年五月二十六日所签订的英苏“战时同盟反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国并在战后合作互助”条约的。
    二月二十四日，苏联副外长葛罗米柯接见英国大使凯莱，并以苏联政府对于上述英国照会的复文交与英国大使。
    苏联政府的照会原文如下：
    一九五一年二月二十四日苏联政府照会。
    “关于英国政府一九五一年二月十七日的照会，苏联外交部兹谨声明如下：苏联政府在今年一月二十日的照会里曾引证无可置辩的证据，证明英国政府违反英苏两国于一九四二年五月二十六日所签订的英苏‘战时同盟反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国并在战后合作互助条约’所规定的责任。英国政府无法反驳这种证据，就在二月十七日的照会中，采取捏造和诽谤的办法，想把英国政府的侵略政策说成和平政策，而把苏联的和平政策说成侵略政策。然而，这种想要逃避答复关于履行条约义务的企图是失败了，因为事实已经证明，英国违反了条约，犯了实行侵略政策、实行发动战争政策而并不实行维护和平政策的罪行。
　英国从一九四六年起，就走上了破坏合作与破坏条约的道路
    （一）苏联政府不能不再一次追述，一九四二年所订英苏条约中，关于英苏对于德国问题所负责任的说法。
    英苏条约第三条规定：“缔约国双方声明，他们愿望在战后时期联合其他具有同样意向的国家来采纳关于共同行动以保卫和平与抵抗侵略的建议。
    在未采纳这些建议以前，他们在战争结束后，将采取他们力所能及的一切措施，使德国或任何其他与之勾结从事侵略欧洲的行为的国家不可能再事侵略与破坏和平。”
    因此，条约第三条的第一部分规定，缔约国双方，应在防止侵略的一切问题上——包括德国问题在内——实行合作政策。
    然而，英国从一九四六年起，就走上不同的道路，即破坏合作与破坏条约的道路。
    只要举出英国政府在德国问题上所采取的几次片面行动的实例，就足以说明这个问题。例如：英国政府在一九四六年，采取片面的行动合并了英、美两国在德国的占领区，其后法国占领区也与前两区合并，结果使德国分裂成为两部分；英国政府在西德发行特别的货币，结果破坏了德国的经济统一而使四国代表组成的管制委员会解体；英国政府采取片面的行动成立了西德的波恩政府，因而在恢复德国国家的统一上，造成了种种障碍；分裂分子拒绝筹备对德和约，而为了无限期地占领西德在该地强行实施占领法规。
    所有这些措施，都是以片面的行动，在没有与苏联合作，并在苏联没有参加的情况下实行的。因此，抛弃在德国问题上的合作政策，从而违犯了英苏条约的第三条的规定的是英国，而不是苏联。
　英国违反条约和国际协定的义务，复活德国军国主义
    （二）条约的第三条的第二部分规定：缔约国双方应采取一切措施，使德国不可能再事侵略和破坏和平。雅尔塔和波茨坦会议，完全遵照这种精神，在德国问题上规定，参加会议的各国应严格遵守肃清德国军国主义和使德国民主化的政策。
    然而，英国政府的政策与这个政策完全相反，英国没有开始使德国民主化，而是在重新起用法西斯头领，使西德逐渐法西斯化；克虏伯自狱中获释以后，英国政府恢复克虏伯及其帝国主义伙伴在鲁尔区的权力，并使尽人皆知的希特勒匪帮的法西斯将领重任要职，过去镇压，现在也还在继续镇压西德民主的与爱好和平的人士。同时，英国政府不但没有肃清德国的军国主义，反而开始恢复德国的战争工业，在把鲁尔变为战争工业的基地以后，开始重新建立由纳粹将领率领的德国正规军队，开始把西德变为新侵略战争的桥头堡垒。
    英国政府过去和现在，都是不顾苏联政府的一再抗议，并违反英苏条约第三条第二部分的规定而实行这些措施的。
    因此，英国已确定地违反了它所负有的防止德国军国主义复活、使德国民主化和肃清德国军国主义的义务，从而破坏了英苏条约和雅尔塔及波茨坦协定的基础。
　英国违反条约，建立反苏的“西欧联盟”和北大西洋集团
    （三）苏联政府也认为有必要再度提请英国政府注意英苏条约的另外一部分，这一部分规定，英国及苏联不得参加任何旨在反对缔约国另一方的联盟。
    英苏条约第七条规定：“缔约国双方保证，不缔结也不参加旨在反对缔约国另一方的任何同盟或联合。”
    至于苏联，苏联政府也严格地遵行了这个义务。苏联政府所签订的条约中，没有一个是针对着英国或反希特勒德国战争中的任何盟国的。苏联过去和现在都不曾参加过任何反英同盟。苏联与欧洲其他国家签订的一切条约，也都与英苏条约一样，是以巩固欧洲和平、防止德国军国主义的复活及德国侵略的再起为目的的。
    虽然苏联政府过去与现在都严格地遵行它所承担的义务，但是，英国政府却公开地蔑视英国根据英苏条约所承担的义务。英国政府与法国政府，共同倡议建立所谓“西欧联盟”，这个联盟，从一开始起，就毫不掩饰它对苏联的敌意。此后，英国与美国就建立了北大西洋国家集团；在组成反希特勒同盟的各大国中，只有苏联没有被列入作为北大西洋公约的缔约国。在这种情况下，那些认为西欧联盟及北大西洋集团是防御性的种种说法之不能成立，是十分明显的。不仅如此，事实证明：西欧联盟及北大西洋集团都是以直接反对苏联及人民民主国家为其目的的。
    目前，西欧联盟和北大西洋集团的侵略性质已被彻底揭穿了。以英美国家集团为首的这些集团，所作的一切关于防御目的的声明，在这些集团力图把西德以及复仇主义的波恩政府和由希特勒匪帮将领率领的西德军队拉进这些集团之后，即失去了它们的意义。
    英国政府无视苏联政府今年一月二十日照会中所作的声明，苏联政府声明说，英国政府像美国和法国政府一样，目前正在从事于组织与西德的军事同盟以反对苏联和人民民主国家。英国政府未敢否认苏联政府的这项声明，因为它如果这样做的话，就不能不和明显的、尽人皆知的事实相矛盾。
    英国政府既然帮助了重建德国的正规军和德国的战争工业，并且正在走上与西德的复仇主义的政府结成直接的军事同盟的道路，从而就粗暴地蹂躏了英苏条约。
　英国诽谤保、匈、罗人民，妄图使这些国家追随英国侵略政策
    （四）英国政府在其二月十七日的照会中，对苏联和已经建立了民主政权，并永远消除了法西斯遗毒的保加利亚、匈牙利与罗马尼亚进行粗暴的诽谤。英国政府显然希望见到这些国家中有愿意追随英国侵略政策的政府。然而，英国政府现在应该明白：保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚的人民与任何其他国家的人民有同样的权利，根据他们的民族利益处理他们自己的内政，而不论他们在上述国家中所建立起来的民主政权是否为某一个外国政府所喜。
    大家都知道，英国政府力图用强力手段使法西斯分子和其他侵略分子在东欧爱好和平的民主国家内复辟，鼓励这些国家中法西斯集团的敌意活动，这些集团的目标，是组织阴谋以推翻人民民主政权。
    英国政府在其二月十七日的照会中，企图把自己说成是人权和基本自由的保卫者，并且说苏联对保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、或希腊的内政有所干涉，但鉴于上述事实，可以证明这种种企图是荒诞不经的。
    英国政府对于捷克斯洛伐克一九四八年二月的政府改组也进行了类似的诽谤，英国政府力图把这次改组硬说成是威胁和平的政变。然而，大家都知道，改组所以发生，是因为在美国及其他外国代理人（也包括美国官方的外交代表在内）的主使下，有人准备在捷克斯洛伐克发动政变，目的是剥夺捷克斯洛伐克人民的民族独立，使捷克斯洛伐克对于英美唯命是听。
    苏联在联合国安全理事会上曾提出关于反对在捷克斯洛伐克进行所谓调查的书面建议——英国政府在它的照会中曾提到这个建议——苏联就这样地执行了它的职责，保障了捷克斯洛伐克的主权，并且阻止了直接破坏联合国宪章的行为，宪章是禁止这个组织干涉各国内政的。
    其次，苏联政府认为英国政府俨然以南斯拉夫民族利益的保护者自居的企图，是一件荒唐的事情。苏联人民谴责而且要继续谴责现在的南斯拉夫统治者，因为这些统治者在他们的国家里，建立了和西班牙佛朗哥政权一样的法西斯政权，而且剥夺了南斯拉夫人民基本的民主权利。苏联人民谴责、而且还要继续谴责南斯拉夫统治者，因为这些统治者组织了反对匈牙利人民民主政府的阴谋，因此成为人民民主国家的死敌。至于南斯拉夫的民族利益，威胁它的不是苏联，而是南斯拉夫现在的统治者。苏联儿女曾流过许多的鲜血，把南斯拉夫人民从德国占领下解放出来，并且保证南斯拉夫的独立。但是，南斯拉夫现在的统治者们，却在他们的全部政策中，力图把南斯拉夫人民的民族利益从属于他们的英美主子的利益。
    英国政府，正像美国和法国政府一样，逃避不了他们拖延签订对奥和约的责任，它想要把这种责任推卸在苏联身上也是不会成功的。
    现在是终止拖延不决地研讨条约中未获协议的各条款的时候了，最重要的是，英美现在必须放弃他们把奥地利变成它们在欧洲腹心地区的军事基地的计划，如它们在的里亚斯特破坏了它们与意大利所签订的和约那样。
　英国诽谤中朝两国为“侵略者”，但派兵侵朝的却是美国和英国
    （五）英国政府在二月十七日的照会中，粗暴地攻击朝鲜人民和中华人民共和国，诽谤地指责它们为侵略者。然而，大家都很明白，朝鲜人民是为了他们国家的统一而进行解放斗争，并不是干涉其他国家的事务。同样，大家都知道，中华人民共和国是保卫自己合法的国家利益，维护它对中国台湾岛的权利，并保卫中国边境使其不受英美军队侵略，英美军队曾闯入朝鲜并威胁着中国边境的安全。保卫它们国家利益和国土的中国和朝鲜并不是侵略者。侵略者是美国和英国，它们从国内派军队到几千公里外的朝鲜领土上去，这些军队在朝鲜摧毁城镇和村庄，抢劫朝鲜人民，奸淫朝鲜妇女，杀戮朝鲜儿童和老年人，已有好多个月了。
    苏联政府同样认为，英国照会中提到马来亚，印度支那和其他各国解放运动的一节是不郑重和荒谬可笑的。这一节竟指责苏联政府对被压迫各国人民的解放斗争表示同情，就是违反英苏条约。英国照会中，谈到什么共产帝国主义，这同样是不郑重而且荒谬的。这显然是从希特勒与墨索里尼的辞典上抄袭来的。第一，英苏条约只包括欧洲国家，决不涉及如马来亚和越南之类的非欧洲国家。第二，如所周知，英苏条约没有一款禁止任何人对任何国家的解放运动表示同情。第三，必须说明的是，只要帝国主义压迫在世界上存在一天，那么被压迫民族的解放运动也就必然存在，不管某些统治者或其他人是否愿意与是否同情。帝国主义压迫激起了各国的解放运动，以这一点为理由来指责苏联政府，正如以世界上发生地震或潮汐为理由来指责苏联政府一样地荒诞不经。
　英国接受了马歇尔计划，已使它变成为美国的奴仆
    （六）英国政府的照会硬说，苏联政府由于声言反对马歇尔计划，从而阻碍了欧洲国家的经济复兴。这一点是绝对错误的。苏联政府之反对马歇尔计划，并不是因为它给某些国家以财政上的援助，而主要地是因为美国的经济援助是以这些国家放弃它们的经济与政治独立、放弃它们的主权为条件的。英国已臣属于美国，它日益丧失它的独立，并正在被改变为美国军队的军事基地，因为不这样它就得不到所谓马歇尔计划的援助。应该说，法国、比利时、土耳其和其他所谓马歇尔化国家的情形都是这样的。
    我们也绝不能忽视，美国政府利用马歇尔计划及对某些国家的附带的财政施舍，以求用一切非法手段破坏正当的国际贸易关系的事实，并对坚决保卫其自身合法经济利益及拒绝别人干涉他们内政的苏联及各人民民主国家强制施行歧视制度。
    英国的照会甚至还谈到维护联合国威信的问题，它责备苏联政府，说它不愿事事追随那些不礼貌地控制着这个在不多久以前，人们还寄予某些希望的国际机构的人。然而，大家都可以很清楚地看到，对于联合国内所发生的令人不满的局势，苏联无论如何是没有责任的。
    更荒谬的是，英国政府竟企图把“罢工和社会骚乱”的责任都推卸到苏联身上，或者把这一切都归罪于情报局，即自一九四七年起，即在欧洲存在的共产党与工人党情报局。英国照会中所使用的这种笨拙的手段简直无法解释，我们只好说这大概是由于拟定照会时太为仓促所致。因为，在英国谁不知道，“罢工和社会骚乱”不仅早在我们自己的时代之前和共产党与工人党情报局成立之前就已存在，而且在我们这一辈之前就早已存在了。
　英国歪曲苏军复员事实，并夸大苏军数量，为英国扩军找寻借口
    （七）英国政府这次的照会，已不再坚持艾德礼首相那众所周知的谰言，硬说苏联战后没有将军队复员。这照会已经意识到艾德礼首相那种说法的绝对荒谬，所以，也认为没有理由怀疑苏联军队战后没有复员了。
    但是，照会却又紧接着说，苏联政府只复员了战时最大限度的军役人员中的一部分。英国照会这个说法是对苏联的诽谤。事实上，苏联政府已经把它的军队基本上而且大规模地复员了。它已将三十三级的役龄人员复员完毕。没有任何一个国家比苏联更需要大规模的复员了，因为如果没有几百万复员的人员回到农场和工厂，苏联便不会有力量组织其战后的经济进展，也不会有力量恢复被德国占领者破坏的地区、市镇、铁道、工业和农业。只有那些意图诋毁苏联的人才能够否认这些事实。
    英国的照会又说，目前的苏联军队，在数量上超过全体西欧国家军队的总和。这种说法也是对苏联的诽谤。目前苏联武装部队的人数，陆、海、空三军合计，与二次世界大战爆发以前（即一九三九年），苏联武装部队的人数相等。
    然而，仅仅北大西洋侵略公约的三个缔约国——美、英、法三国——目前便拥有武装部队陆、空、海军五百万人以上，这三个国家的武装部队正在继续迅速增多，同时这些国家的工业已经动员起来，进一步地扩大军事生产。我们之所以把这三个国家的军队说作一支军队，主要是因为现在这三个国家的军队，已不是三支独立的军队了，它们已经是由美国军人把它们联合起来，由美国将领艾森豪威尔来指挥的一支军队了。
    这里应该指出，英、法、美这一支武装部队的人数，比第二次世界大战以前，一九三九年它们所拥有的人数超过数倍，而且比苏联现有武装部队的人数多一倍以上。为什么英、美、法的武装部队需要维持超过苏联武装部队数量一倍以上的这种优势呢？当然，这不是为了防止德国和日本可能发动的侵略。英国照会并不否认，这是这些国家在某种情况之下，主要地为了对付苏联用的。
    因此，英国政府所称，苏联武装部队在数量上超过西方各国武装部队的总和这一点，乃是一种混淆视听的诽谤，其目的在于蛊惑舆论，从而为英国的扩张军备运动找寻借口。
    但从这里就可以明白：英、美、法三国既然已在武装力量上超过苏联一倍，并仍在力图扩大自己的武装力量，因而就不是在准备防御，乃是在准备侵略，准备发动新的世界大战。
　英国在照会中妄称对苏没有敌意，事实上却有意对苏联进行诽谤
    （八）苏联政府没有理由怀疑，在英国人民大众中间，不仅是在战争结束的时候，并且也在目前，普遍存在着对于苏联的善意，这一点是完全自然的，这不仅是因为苏联人民在保卫祖国反对希特勒的侵略中创造了卓绝的功勋，也因为苏联人民在为共同击败希特勒主义而争取胜利的事业中，提供了决定性的贡献。这一点，在英国的照会中，也已予以某种程度的承认。在苏联人民这一方面，他们对英国人民一向怀抱着，现在仍然继续怀抱着友情和感激，正如他们对于曾经保卫自己的自由，与苏联人民同心戮力争取尽早结束战争并消灭希特勒主义的一切国家的人民，怀抱着友情与感激一样。
    但是，苏联政府，不认为英国照会中所称英国政府似乎也曾坚决不渝地谋求与苏联合作一节，是有根据的。这里可以回忆一下：远在一九四四年，在工党的年会上，现在当权的工党领袖们曾通过决定一项，禁止工党党员参加以加强英苏友谊为宗旨的英国社会团体的工作。甚至保守党的人们，都没有想到过这样露骨地敌视苏联的主意。
    由此可以得出这种结论，即：当英国政府为要战胜希特勒德国而不能不需要苏联的时候，它就多少抑制了反对苏联的情绪，抑制了对苏维埃国家敌视的态度。但是，看见英国人民争取与苏联人民友好的运动日渐增长起来的时候，工党领袖们甚至在战争结束以前，一俟希特勒德国的失败已属显明之时，就立即表现出不安，并急忙采取削弱英国人民与苏联人民间友好关系的措施。这件事便足以说明为什么一九四四年工党会议通过决议，规定凡参加英苏友好协会者，不得参加工党。这个可耻的决议在以后——已经是战后——的工党会议上，又一再被追认，这并不是偶然的。不仅如此，最近几年，工党领袖又和保守党领袖指挥着凶恶的反对苏联的诽谤运动，这个英国国内的运动正在用人为的方法经常予以怂恿与煽动。
    鉴于上述这些事实，英国照会内所说，好像英国政府对苏联没有敌意，而是在努力发展英苏人民间的合作似的，又好像这种努力因为苏联政府没有这种愿望而受到了阻碍似的，而据说，苏联政府想把苏联人民和外面的世界隔离开来。这样的说法，是有意向它本国人民隐瞒真相，并且是有意对苏联进行厚颜无耻的诽谤。
    英国政府已不再关心巩固国际间的和平，它现在已把它的命运与肆无忌惮的军备扩张运动及胡作非为的新战争宣传联结起来了；苏联政府显然与英国政府不同，它仍然坚持其爱好和平的立场。苏联政府以及苏联整个社会，天天都以加强国际友好的精神，以拥护和平事业及防止新战争的精神，以及揭发战争贩子阴谋诡计的办法来教育苏联人民。正是为了这个原因，苏联政府认为，忠实遵行英苏条约以及严格遵行关于德国问题的雅尔塔与波茨坦协定至为重要，尤其是在违反这些协定的行为严重损害了维护和平的事业的时候。
　苏联对英政府声明不能具有充分信心，但仍愿与英谈判，力求利
        用一切机会改进与英国的关系
    （九）英国政府在其照会中，表示愿按照英苏条约的精神，与苏联进行谈判，以求长期改善两国的关系。由于上述诸端，苏联政府对英国政府的声明不能具有充分信心。但苏联政府仍愿意参加这种谈判，以力求利用一切机会改进与英国的关系。
    苏联政府将十分重视英国政府任何真正旨在改进与我国之关系的步骤。”
