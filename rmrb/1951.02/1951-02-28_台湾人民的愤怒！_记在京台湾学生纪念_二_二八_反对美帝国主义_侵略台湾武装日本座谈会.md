　　The Anger of the Taiwanese People!
　　– A Record of Taiwanese Students in Beijing Commemorating "February 28th" and Opposing U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan and the Arming of Japan Forum
　　Bai Sheng
　　Four years ago today, February 28, 1947, the people of Taiwan heroically rose up in revolt, resisting the fascist rule of the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was selling out the country and imposing a dictatorial regime. This uprising fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit of the Taiwanese people.

　　On February 26th, patriotic Taiwanese youth and students from Taiwan and Japan held a forum in the meeting room of the All-China Students' Federation to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the "February 28th" uprising of the Taiwanese people and to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and the arming of Japan. Taiwanese youth and students who had recently returned to the motherland, including Yang Dongshan, Chen Erxun, Zeng Ming, Li Ming, Weng Zhaoqi, Li Weiguang, Wu Ketai, and Xu Yang, excitedly recounted the scenes of the "February 28th" uprising, denounced the crimes of Japanese imperialism and the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries in oppressing Taiwanese youth and students, and described the heroic struggle of the Taiwanese people against domestic and foreign reactionaries. In fifty years of arduous struggle, the heroic Taiwanese people paid a tremendous price, and their patriotic spirit grew stronger in the crucible of battle. Japanese imperialism implemented enslavement education in Taiwan, and Taiwanese students, from the moment they entered elementary school, had to speak Japanese and were forbidden to speak Chinese. The entire curriculum was designed to eliminate the national consciousness of Taiwanese youth and instill slavish ideas. One Taiwanese elementary school student was locked up by the Japanese simply for refusing to acknowledge that he was Japanese. During World War II, the Japanese forced Chinese youth and students to participate in grueling labor, military training, transporting military supplies, and serving as cannon fodder. All of Taiwan's resources were plundered by the Japanese bandits, and the Taiwanese people often could not eat the white rice they grew themselves, but could only eat the black rice rationed by the Japanese. The Taiwanese people lived a painful life of oppression and enslavement, longing for liberation and a return to the embrace of the motherland. In 1945, after Japan surrendered, the Taiwanese people were so happy and excited, believing that they could live free and happy lives. But their hopes quickly turned to disappointment, as the bloody rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, was even worse than that of Japanese imperialism. Witnessing the crimes of the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in selling out the country and harming the people, and suffering all kinds of brutal oppression and exploitation, the Taiwanese people could no longer tolerate it and finally launched an unprecedentedly huge wave of resistance. This was the "February 28th" uprising.

　　On February 27, 1947, smuggling investigators from the Chiang bandit gang government's Monopoly Bureau in Taipei City injured a female hawker, Lin Jiangmai, and shot and killed one of the onlookers. The people of Taipei City, filled with righteous indignation, marched to the fake police bureau and fake military police corps to petition, demanding that the murderers be punished, but to no avail. The next day, "February 28th," the people again petitioned the fake administrative governor's office and were again brutally killed by the Chiang bandit troops. The anger of the Taiwanese people burned uncontrollably. They heroically occupied the Taiwan Broadcasting Station, calling on the people of the entire province to rise up against the rule of the Chiang bandit gang, which received widespread response and support from the people.

　　The "February 28th" uprising vividly demonstrated the solidarity and heroic fighting spirit of the Taiwanese people. Empty-handed, the Taiwanese people seized weapons from the enemy to arm themselves, fought selflessly, and wrote a heroic saga with patriotic blood. The Taiwanese people became stronger in the crucible of this battle and gained a clearer understanding of the hideous face of the Chiang bandit gang!

　　From Taiwanese students Lin Shunshan, Zeng Shaode, Zheng Jiongzao, Chen Huijuan, and others who had just returned to the motherland from Taiwan and Japan, we also heard about the U.S. imperialists' arrogant crimes of aggression against Taiwan and the rearmament of Japan. After "February 28th," U.S. imperialism further openly intensified its aggression against Taiwan. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism more actively helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang strengthen its bloody rule over the Taiwanese people, and used the executioners who massacred the Taiwanese people, such as Hasegawa Kiyoshi, the former Japanese governor-general of Taiwan, and Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation, to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang massacre the Taiwanese people. On the other hand, the U.S. Air Force and Navy occupied many bases in Taiwan, and U.S. monopoly capital controlled Taiwan's major enterprises and manipulated Taiwan's economic lifeline, turning Taiwan into its colony and military base.

　　Zeng Shaode, a student at Hokkaido University's Faculty of Agriculture who had just returned from Japan, indignantly recounted the scene he witnessed of U.S. imperialism arming Japan. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. troops in Hokkaido, Japan, were transferred to Korea, and immediately transferred here was the Japanese police reserve force trained by the United States. These people were all unemployed workers, intellectuals, and poor peasants from the countryside who were either captured or deceived from the cities. The Japanese reactionaries deceived them by saying that as police reservists, they could receive 4,000 yen per month and 50,000 yen after two years, and then they would be sent out to be assigned jobs. But this set of lies was immediately shattered by the facts. The deceived Japanese people rose up in resistance, and some began to flee, unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism. Comrade Zeng Shaode also told us that Japanese heavy industry companies were manufacturing tanks, and Isuzu was also manufacturing large quantities of military trucks under the instructions of U.S. imperialism. This is what he saw with his own eyes when he returned from Tokyo.

　　Comrade Zeng Shaode also talked about the Japanese students' struggle against U.S. rearmament of Japan under the oppression of U.S. imperialism. When Eells, the highest education advisor of MacArthur's headquarters, proposed so-called "university bills" and other colonial education reforms to the Japanese reactionary government, it immediately aroused the anger of students across Japan. Japanese students heroically launched a struggle against enslavement education, putting forward slogans such as "Oppose U.S. rearmament of Japan," "Oppose the colonization of Japan," and "Demand the withdrawal of all U.S. occupation forces." At Kyoto University in Japan, this struggle was so fierce that the reactionaries even locked up the president, but the teachers and students became more united and continued the anti-Eells movement. When the Japanese reactionary government "rectified" Japanese progressive professors, Japanese students immediately rose up in opposition.

　　Comrade Zheng Jiongzao also just returned from Japan. He said that the U.S. imperialist crimes of arming Japan began after Japan surrendered. U.S. imperialism transported many underground railway steel materials to the airport to manufacture military aircraft equipment. Under the instructions of its American master, the Japanese reactionaries even built military highways in the name of beautifying the city, and designated them as military zones, prohibiting the Japanese people from entering. They also built many U.S. military bases, equipped with military equipment, preparing to launch a war of aggression.

　　During the forum, everyone was extremely indignant at the U.S. imperialists' evil deeds of actively arming Japan and attempting to expand the war of aggression. Every student firmly stated that the Taiwanese people have the determination and confidence to work with the people of the whole country to defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism and liberate Taiwan, the territory of the motherland.

　　台湾人民的愤怒！
　　——记在京台湾学生纪念“二·二八”反对美帝国主义
　　侵略台湾武装日本座谈会

    四年前的今天，——一九四七年二月二十八日，台湾人民英勇起义，反抗美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮卖国独裁的法西斯统治。这次起义充分表现了台湾人民的爱国主义精神。
    二月二十六日，来自台湾和日本的台湾爱国青年同学，在全国学联的会议室里，举行了纪念台湾人民“二·二八”起义四周年和反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、武装日本的座谈会。回到祖国不久的台湾青年学生杨东山、陈而逊、曾明、立明、翁肇祺、李唯光、吴克泰、许阳等激动地叙述着“二·二八”起义的情景，控诉了日本帝国主义以及美蒋反动派压迫台湾青年学生的罪行，描述了台湾人民反抗国内外反动派的英勇斗争。在五十年的艰苦斗争中，英勇的台湾人民付出了极大的牺牲代价，他们的爱国主义精神在战斗锻炼中愈加强旺起来了。日本帝国主义在台湾施行奴化教育，台湾学生从进小学起就得说日本话、不准说中国话。全部课程都是为了消灭台湾青年的民族意识，灌输奴化思想。一个台湾小学生因为坚决拒绝承认是日本人，而被日本人关起来。在第二次世界大战期中，日本人强迫中国青年学生参加苦役劳动，参加军事训练，给他们运军粮，当炮灰。台湾所有的物产都被日本强盗大量运走了，台湾人经常吃不到自己种的白米，只能吃到日本人配给的黑米。台湾人民过着被压迫被奴役的痛苦日子，他们渴望着解放，回到祖国的怀抱。一九四五年日本投降后，台湾人民是多么高兴，多么兴奋，满以为可以过自由幸福的日子了。但他们的希望立刻变成了失望，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮血腥统治，比之日本帝国主义的，更有过之而无不及。台湾人民目睹美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮卖国害民的罪行，身受着种种残暴无比的压迫和剥削，忍无可忍，终于掀起了空前巨大的反抗怒潮。这就是“二·二八”的起义运动。
    一九四七年二月二十七日，蒋匪帮政府专卖局的缉私人员在台北市打伤了女小贩林江迈，并开枪打死了围观的群众一人。台北市人民激于义愤，集队向伪警察局和伪宪兵团请愿，要求惩办杀人凶犯，毫无结果。次日即“二·二八”，人民又向伪行政长官公署请愿，又被蒋匪军残暴地杀死了数人。台湾人民的怒火便无可遏止地燃烧起来了。他们英勇地占领了台湾广播电台，号召全省人民起来反抗蒋匪帮统治，获得了广大人民的响应和支持。
    “二·二八”起义生动地证明了台湾人民的团结力量和英勇战斗的精神。台湾人民赤手空拳，夺取了敌人的武器来武装自己，忘我地战斗着，用爱国的热血写下了可歌可泣的英雄事迹。台湾人民在这次战斗的锻炼中更坚强起来，更认识了蒋匪帮的狰狞面目！
    从刚由台湾和日本回到祖国来的台湾同学林顺三、曾绍德、郑炯灶、陈蕙娟等口中，我们又听到美帝国主义侵略台湾和重新武装日本的狂妄罪行。“二·二八”以后，美帝国主义更进一步地公开侵略台湾。一方面，美帝国主义更加积极地帮助蒋介石匪帮加强对台湾人民的血腥统治，并利用屠杀台湾人民的刽子手，前日本驻台湾总督长谷川清及前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀台湾人民，而另一方面，美国海空军在台湾占据了许多基地，美国独占资本则控制了台湾的主要企业，操纵了台湾的经济命脉，把台湾变成了它的殖民地和军事基地。
    刚从日本归国的北海道大学农学院学生曾绍德愤慨地叙说了他亲眼看见美帝国主义武装日本的情景。朝鲜战争爆发后，在日本北海道的美国军队都调到了朝鲜，而立刻调到这里来的是美国训练出来的日本警察后备队。这些人都是从城市抓来或骗来的失业工人、知识分子以及农村中的贫雇农。日本反动派欺骗他们说：当警察后备队每月可拿四千元日币，两年后可拿到五万元日币，然后送他们出去分配工作。但这一套鬼话，立刻被事实粉碎了。被骗去的日本人民起来反抗，有的开始逃跑，不愿当美帝国主义的炮灰。曾绍德同学又告诉我们，日本重工业公司正在制造坦克，五十铃公司在美帝指示下也在制造大批军用卡车。这是他从东京回来时亲眼看到的。
    曾绍德同学又谈到在美帝国主义压迫下的日本学生反对美国武装日本的斗争。当麦克阿瑟司令部的最高教育顾问意尔斯，向日本反动政府提出所谓“大学法案”等殖民地化的教育改革后，立即引起了全日学生的愤怒，日本学生英勇地展开了反奴化教育的斗争，提出“反对美国武装日本”、“反对日本殖民地化”、“要求全部美占领军撤退”等口号。在日本京都大学，这个斗争是那样激烈，反动派竟把校长关起来，但师生们团结得更紧，继续进行了反意尔斯运动。当日本反动政府“整肃”日本进步教授的时候，日本学生立即全体起来反对。
    郑炯灶同学也是刚由日本归国的。他说，从日本投降后，美帝国主义武装日本的罪行就开始了。美帝国主义把许多地下铁道钢料都运到飞机场去，制造军用飞机的器械。日本反动派在其美国主子的指示下，更以美化都市为名，修建军用公路，并划为军事区，不准日本人民进入。并建筑了许多美军基地，装备军用器材，准备发动侵略战争。
    座谈中，大家对美帝国主义积极武装日本，妄图扩大侵略战争的罪恶事实，异常愤慨。每个同学都坚决表示台湾人民有决心有信心和全国人民一起，打败美帝国主义的侵略，解放祖国的领土台湾。
