    Ding County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Coordinates Spring Planting, Supplying Members with Fertilizer and Seeds
    The Ding County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the county-level cooperatives are preparing a large quantity of fertilizer, improved seeds, and farm tools to supply members' needs and ensure timely spring planting and sowing. To encourage members to plant cotton, the special district supply and marketing cooperative instructed the county-level cooperatives to reserve improved seeds based on cotton planting conditions during last year's cotton procurement and processing. Ding County alone prepared more than one million jin. After the Spring Festival, this batch of cotton seeds will be supplied to cooperative members in three ways: loans, sales, and exchanges. Regarding fertilizer, in addition to the 2.04 million jin of soybeans allocated by the Hebei Provincial Cooperative, the special district cooperative purchased 1.14 million jin of black beans and 5.52 million jin of bean cakes from Suiyuan and Shanxi. This batch of fertilizer has begun to be allocated to the county-level cooperatives.
    In order to alleviate the difficulties in the lives of cooperative members in disaster areas and mountainous areas, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the disaster-stricken counties have prepared early-maturing crop seeds. For example, Raoyang and Lixian have prepared 43,000 jin of barley seeds, and Fuping County Cooperative has prepared five shi of spring millet and sent people to Yuxian to purchase more than 2,000 farm tools such as plowshares for the cooperative members.
    In order to solve the difficulty of coal burning for cooperative members in the spring, the special district supply and marketing cooperative has purchased 1,800 tons of coal from Shanxi. In addition, it is planned to exchange 3 million jin of coarse grains for fine grains on behalf of the grain company to solve the food shortage difficulties of cooperative members.

    定县专区供销社配合春耕
    供给社员肥料籽种
    定县专区供销合作社及各县社为保证社员及时春耕播种，准备了大批肥料，优良籽种，农具等供应社员需要。该专区供销社为鼓励社员栽种棉花，在去年征棉加工时，即指示各县社根据种棉情况，已留出优良籽种，如定县即准备了一百多万斤。这批棉籽，在春节后，即将以贷、卖、换三种方式供给社员群众。肥料方面，河北省社已拨到黄豆二百零四万斤外，专区社并从绥远、山西等地购得黑豆一百一十四万斤，豆饼五百五十二万斤，这批肥料已开始向各县社拨发。
    专区供销社为调剂灾区及山区社员生活上的困难，各受灾县的供销社已准备了早熟作物籽种。如饶阳、蠡县已准备大麦籽四万三千斤，阜平县社准备春谷五石，并派人到盂县采购犁铧等农具二千余件供给社员。
    为解决社员春季烧煤困难，专区供销社已从山西购煤一千八百吨。此外并计划代粮食公司以粗粮换细粮三百万斤，以解决社员的缺粮困难。
