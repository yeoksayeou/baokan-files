　　How Did We Experiment with "Tissue Therapy"?

　　In the Soviet Union, "tissue therapy" has achieved remarkable results. It is not only effective for ophthalmological diseases such as corneal opacity, optic nerve atrophy, pigmentary retinitis, myopic choroiditis, etc., but also has considerable effect on general diseases such as tracheobronchial asthma, traumatic epilepsy, peptic ulcer, cicatricial diseases, skin diseases, and diseases of the nervous and peripheral nervous systems.

　　After a period of study and research, we deeply felt that we should absorb the valuable experience of the Soviet medical community to serve the broad masses of workers and peasants. Therefore, we decided to start experimenting with "tissue therapy." However, our hospital lacked the most important tool for experimenting with "tissue therapy" - an electric refrigerator. How could we refrigerate the tissue and maintain a certain temperature (2-4°C)? Everyone's confidence began to waver.

　　"In a poor environment, powerful substances can be generated" (Filatov's words), "We cannot wait for nature to give us things, it is our task to ask nature for things" (Michurin's words), these two admonitions inspired us. With the support of the Party, government, and trade union, we overcame all difficulties and spent two weeks designing and manufacturing a temperature-regulating refrigerator to replace the electric refrigerator.

　　After the refrigerator was completed, we began to collect tissue materials. The left upper limb amputated from a 32-year-old man due to pathological reasons was disinfected, the sebaceous glands were removed, the hair was shaved, and tissues (skin, fascia, muscle, tendon, and nerve trunk, etc.) from its completely healthy part were taken, washed with physiological saline, and refrigerated in glass containers (2-4°C). After five to seven days, it was taken out for autoclaving (1.5 atmospheres, 120 degrees, sterilized for one hour). In the first "tissue therapy," a total of nineteen people were treated, including: three with gastric ulcer, nine with rheumatoid arthritis, one with skin lichen, two with lower leg ulcer, one with burning neuralgia, one with chronic nephritis, one with chronic spinal osteomyelitis, and one with traumatic paraplegia after lumbar vertebral fracture.

　　The experimental results were very good. For example, patient Suzuki had suffered from gastric ulcer for more than a year, with daily stomach pain and inability to sleep. Although he had received injections and medication, it was still ineffective. After four days of tissue therapy, the above symptoms completely disappeared, his appetite increased, and his work efficiency was greatly improved. The symptoms of another gastric ulcer patient, Zhao Yuan, were even more severe. After three days of treatment, his condition was good, his appetite increased, and occult blood in the stool was negative after two examinations. Other patients also had very good results after treatment (only two cases were ineffective).

　　This experiment had shortcomings. For example, nearly a quarter of the patients developed suppuration after the surgery. The reason was that the ice in the refrigerator melted, and water seeped into the tissue; at the same time, because too many people underwent surgery at the same time, the tissue was exposed in the operating room for a long time.

　　In order to overcome the above shortcomings, we decided to conduct a second experiment. But the problem came, and no more amputated limbs could be found. After research, we slaughtered a healthy male dog and extracted its liver, spleen, adrenal gland, thymus, thyroid gland, etc., and treated thirty people after strict disinfection.

　　In the third experiment, we extracted the liver, spleen, adrenal gland, thymus and thyroid gland from a stillborn female fetus (died six hours), taken from a pregnant woman (uterine rupture), and treated twelve people.

　　From these three experiments, we gained the following experience in surgical operation: After the tissue is autoclaved, it should be immediately placed in a dark and cold place for application during surgery. The site for tissue implantation is most suitable at the third to fourth ribs of the left chest wall, because the subcutaneous connective tissue there is looser, and the movement during breathing is slow, so it will not cause excessive traction pain after surgery. After strict disinfection of the skin, make a small incision of 2-2.5 cm along the direction of the ribs (directly to the periosteal layer), and use hemostatic forceps to probe into the incision cavity to separate the surrounding connective tissue (about 3 cm long and 2 cm wide), then insert the prepared tissue (the amount of tissue implanted per person is 4-7 cm, cut into a flat rectangle) into the cavity, suture the skin with two stitches, cover with gauze, and bandage. The entire operation takes five minutes. Remove the stitches on the seventh day.

　　The effect of "tissue therapy" is great, and the following statistics prove this: Of ten cases of gastric ulcer, two were cured, seven were good, and one was not cured. Of two cases of lower leg ulcer, both were cured. One case of skin lupus was cured. Of two cases of chronic amoebiasis, both were cured. Of three cases of chronic gastritis, all three were good. Of four cases of traumatic spinal nerve transection, all four were good. One case of tracheobronchial asthma was good. Of fourteen cases of rheumatoid arthritis, three were cured, eight were good, and three were not cured. Of three cases of burning neuralgia, one was cured, one was good, and one was not cured. Of two cases of chronic spinal osteomyelitis, one was cured and one was good. Of two cases of joint dysfunction after fracture, both were good. Of two cases of hemorrhoids and fistula, one was cured and one was good. One case of burn scar contracture was good. Of three cases of cerebral nerve dysfunction after head trauma, all three were good. One case of keratitis was good. One case of traumatic epilepsy was not cured. One case of pulmonary infiltration was good. One case of skin lichen was good. One case of chronic nephritis was good. Of five cases of traumatic neuralgia after lumbar vertebral fracture, three were good and two were not cured.

　　This experiment deeply educated all our medical workers, making us truly recognize the great achievements of the Soviet medical community; at the same time, it cleared up our erroneous thinking of "American medicine first."

### 我们怎样实验“组织疗法”的？

　　我们怎样实验“组织疗法”的？
    东北鹤岗矿务局职工医院  黄展延、罗耀德
    在苏联，“组织疗法”已获得了卓著的成效。它不仅对眼科疾患如角膜溷浊、视神经萎缩、色素性视网膜炎、近视脉络膜炎等有效，对一般疾患如气管支喘息、外伤性癫痫、消化性溃疡、瘢痕性疾患、皮肤疾患、神经及末梢神经系疾患也都有相当宏大的效果。
    经过了一个时期的学习和研讨，我们深深感到我们应该把苏联医学界的宝贵经验吸收过来，为广大的工农服务。于是，我们决定开始作“组织疗法”的实验。可是，我们医院里却没有实验“组织疗法”的最重要工具——电气冰箱，怎么能把组织进行冷藏并保持一定的温度（２—４℃）呢？大家的信心便动摇起来了。
    “在不良的环境中，能滋生有力量的物质”（费拉托夫语），“我们不能等待自然赐给我们东西，向自然去要东西才是我们的任务”（米邱林语），这两句警语启示了我们。在党、政、工会的支持下，我们克服了一切的困难，用两个星期的工夫设计制造了能调节温度的冰箱，以代替电气冰箱。
    冰箱完成以后，我们就开始采集组织材料，把因病理原因从一个三十二岁的男子身上截断下来的左侧上肢加以消毒，清除了皮脂腺，剃去了汗毛，摘取其完全健康部分的组织（皮肤、肌膜、肌肉、腱及神经干等），用生理食盐水清洗后放入玻璃器皿中冷藏（２—４℃）。经过五至七天以后，即取出进行高压灭菌（１．５气压，１２０度，消毒一小时）。在首次“组织疗法”中，共治疗了十九人，计：胃溃疡三人，偻麻质斯九人，皮肤苔癣一人，下腿溃疡二人，灼性神经痛一人，慢性肾脏炎一人，慢性脊椎炎一人，腰椎骨折后脊髓神经截瘫一人。
    试验结果，效果很好。例如患者铃木患胃溃疡已一年余，每日胃疼，不能睡眠，虽经打针服药，仍不见效。经组织疗法后四日，上述症状完全消失，食欲增进，工作效力亦大为提高。另一个胃溃疡患者赵渊的症状更为严重，经三天的治疗以后，情况良好，食欲增进，大便中的潜出血经两次检查均是阴性。其他患者，经治疗后，效果亦极良好（只有两个病例未见效）。
    此次实验是有缺点的，例如在施行手术后差不多有四分之一的患者曾发生化脓的现象。原因是冰箱里的冰溶化了，水份渗入组织中；同时，由于在同一时间中施行手术的人太多，使组织长时间的暴露在手术室中。
    为了克服上述缺点，我们决定再作第二次试验。但是问题来了，再也找不到切断的体肢。经过研究以后，我们即杀了一条健康的雄狗，摘取其肝脏、脾脏、副肾胸腺、甲状腺等，经严密消毒后治疗了三十人。
    第三次实验时，我们从一个妊妇（子宫破裂）身上取出之死胎儿（女，死去六小时），摘取肝、脾、副肾、胸腺及甲状腺治疗了十二人。
    从这三次实验中，我们在手术操作法上得到了如下的经验：组织经过高压消毒以后，应立即放置在暗冷的地方，以备施行手术时应用。组织植入的部位，以左侧之胸壁第三至第四肋骨处为最适宜，因该处之皮下结缔组织较粗松，呼吸时活动缓慢，不致引起手术后的过度牵引痛。皮肤经严密消毒后，沿肋骨方向施行二——二·五糎之小切口（直达肌膜层），用止血错搜入切创腔内排开周围结缔组织，（长约三糎阔约二糎），然后将准备好的组织（每人植入的组织量为四——七公分，切成扁平长方形）纳入腔内，行二针皮肤缝合，盖上纱布，用绷带包扎。全部操作时间为五分钟。第七日拔线。
    “组织疗法”的效果是很大的，下列的统计就证明了这一点：胃溃疡十例，治愈二例，七例良好，未愈一例。下腿溃疡二例，治愈二例。皮肤狼疮一例，治愈一例。慢性阿米巴二例，治愈二例。慢性胃炎三例，良好三例。外伤性脊椎神经性截瘫四例，良好四例。气管支喘息一例，良好一例。偻麻质斯十四例，治愈三例，良好八例，未愈三例。灼性神经痛三例，治愈一例，良好一例，未愈一例。慢性脊椎炎二例，治愈一例，良好一例。骨折后关节机能障碍二例，良好二例。痔瘘二例，治愈一例，良好一例。火伤性瘢痕挛缩一例，良好一例。头部外伤后脑神经群机能障碍三例，良好三例。角膜炎一例，良好一例。外伤性癫痫一例，未愈一例。肺侵润一例，良好一例。皮肤苔癣一例，良好一例。慢性肾脏炎一例，良好一例。腰椎骨折后外伤性神经痛五例，良好三例，未愈二例。
    这一实验，深深地教育了我们全体医务工作者，使我们真正认识了苏联医学界的伟大成就；同时也使我们清除了“美国医学第一”的错误思想。
