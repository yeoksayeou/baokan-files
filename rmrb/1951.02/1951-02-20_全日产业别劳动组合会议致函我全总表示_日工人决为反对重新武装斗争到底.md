Xinhua News Agency, 17th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has received a letter dated January 27th from the Executive Committee of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, thanking the ACFTU for the New Year's greetings. The letter firmly states that Japanese workers are determined to fight to the end for the realization of a comprehensive peace treaty and against rearmament. It also points out that the solidarity of the working classes of China and Japan will deal the greatest blow to the imperialists who want to turn all of Asia into a colony. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Brothers of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

　　Thank you for the New Year's card.

　　At the beginning of 1951, we, the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions (All-Japan Industrial Unions Conference), on behalf of the entire Japanese working class, extend our heartfelt friendship to you.

　　1951 is the most important year because it will determine whether we, the Japanese people, move towards peace and independence with a comprehensive peace treaty, or towards slavery and cannon fodder with a separate peace treaty. This is not only a major issue for the Japanese people but also a most important issue for the Chinese people. Currently, the imperialists' plot to use Japan as a base to invade Asia has been struck by the heroic Chinese people.

　　We Japanese workers are determined to join with the progressive workers of the world to deal a fatal blow to the imperialists and their lackeys. We demand the realization of a comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration. We are determined to fight to the end for the independence of Japan and world peace.

　　On December 4th last year, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, advocating the conclusion of a common peace treaty with Japan, the withdrawal of occupying forces in Japan, and the development of Japan's peaceful industries. This proposal can guarantee Japan's complete independence and peaceful development, is completely consistent with the demands of our Japanese working class, and is sincerely supported by us Japanese workers. The protest movement launched by the Chinese workers against the unreasonable dissolution of "Zenroren" and the illegal judgment of the Matsukawa incident has greatly encouraged our will to fight against the imperialists and their lackeys, and has also strengthened our confidence in victory. We express our heartfelt gratitude to our Chinese brothers. We are convinced that the solidarity of the working classes of China and Japan, as demonstrated in practice, will deal the greatest blow to the imperialists who want to turn all of Asia into a colony.

　　In order to realize their war plans, the imperialists have completely prohibited Sino-Japanese trade. As a result, Japan's peaceful industries have been plunged into a serious crisis. On this issue, not only Japanese workers but also ordinary Japanese citizens and the national bourgeoisie have protested. The American and Japanese reactionaries have also arrested activists of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and imposed heavy sentences on them. Progressive workers in Japan are constantly being expelled from factories and subjected to疯狂镇压。 However, no matter how brutal the American and Japanese reactionaries are, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be destroyed, and their struggle for the liberation of Asian nations and the defense of world peace will be further strengthened. Now, the imperialists and their lackeys are attempting to rearm Japan and use Japan as a base for invading China, but the Japanese people, who were once driven by the militarists to wage a long-term war against the Chinese people, have experienced the evils of aggressive war and how the results of aggressive war are detrimental to the Japanese people.

　　Therefore, the Japanese people are determined not to fight against the Chinese people again but to fight to the end against the imperialists and their lackeys who want to make the Chinese and Japanese people kill each other and profit from it. We are convinced that only the solidarity of the working classes of China and Japan, united through the fortress of world lasting peace – the World Federation of Trade Unions – is the pillar of the solid friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

　　全日产业别劳动组合会议致函我全总表示
    日工人决为反对重新武装斗争到底
    【新华社十七日讯】中华全国总工会收到全日本产业别劳动组合会议的执行委员会于一月二十七日的来信，感谢全总新年寄去的贺年片。信中坚决表示日本工人决为实现全面媾和与反对重新武装而斗争到底，并指出中日两国工人阶级的团结，必将给予想使全亚洲变为殖民地的帝国主义者以最大的打击。来信全文如下：中华全国总工会的兄弟们：
    贺年片收到了，谢谢你们。
    当一九五一年的开始，我们全日本产业别劳动组合会议（全日本产业工会会议）代表全日本工人阶级向你们表示衷心的友爱。
    一九五一年是最重要的一年，因为它将决定我们日本人民以全面媾和走向和平和独立，或者以单独媾和走向奴隶和炮灰的道路。这不单是日本人民的重大问题，也是中国人民的一个最重要的问题。目前帝国主义者以日本为基地企图侵略亚洲的阴谋，已遭受到英勇的中国人民的打击。
    我们日本工人决心和全世界进步的工人一道，给予帝国主义者及其走狗以致命的打击。我们要求根据波茨坦宣言，实现全面媾和。我们决心为实现日本独立和世界和平而奋斗到底。
    去年十二月四日，中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来发表关于对日和约问题的声明，主张缔结共同的对日和约，撤退在日本的占领军，发展日本的和平工业。这主张是可以保障日本的完全独立与和平发展的，是与我们日本工人阶级的要求完全一致的，是为我们日本工人所诚心诚意地拥护的。中国工人们为“全劳联”被无理解散及松川事件的非法判决而发起的抗议运动，大大地鼓舞了我们向帝国主义者及其走狗斗争的意志，同时也更加强了我们对胜利的信心。我们对中国兄弟们表示衷心的感谢。我们确信事实上所表现出来的中日两国工人阶级的团结，必将给予想使全亚洲变为殖民地的帝国主义者以最大的打击。
    帝国主义者们为了实现他们的战争计划，全面的禁止了中日贸易。因此日本的和平工业被陷于严重的危机中。对于这个问题，不单是日本工人，就是日本一般市民和民族资产阶级也提出了抗议。美、日反动派还逮捕了中日友好协会的活动分子，并加以重罪。日本的进步工人不断地被驱逐出工厂，遭到疯狂的镇压。然而不管美、日反动派如何残暴，中日两国人民的友谊是不能被破坏的，他们为亚洲民族解放和保卫世界和平的斗争将要更加强。现在帝国主义者及其走狗们，企图重新武装日本，把日本作为侵略中国的基地，但曾经被军国主义者们驱使和中国人民进行长期战争的日本人民，已体验到侵略战争的罪恶，和侵略战争的结果是怎样对日本人民不利。
    因此，日本人民决不愿再与中国人民作战，而要对想使中日两国人民互相残杀，自己从中得利的帝国主义者及其走狗们斗争到底。我们确信只有通过世界持久和平的堡垒——世界工联而结合起来的中日两国工人阶级的团结，才是中日两国人民坚固的友情的支柱。
                全日本产业别劳动组合会议执行委员会
                        一九五一年一月二十七日
    按：全日本产业别劳动组合会议是日本的进步工会组织，拥有会员四百万人，简称为“产别”，一九四六年八月一日成立，负责人是吉田资治。去年八月被日本反动政府解散的“全劳联”是“产别”的骨干。
