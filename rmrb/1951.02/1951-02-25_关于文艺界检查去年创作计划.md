Reader's Letters

　　Regarding the Literary and Art Circles' Review of Last Year's Creation Plans
　　Comrade A Cong:
　　Your suggestion that the literary and art circles review how much of the creation plans published at the beginning of last year in publications such as "People's Literature" have been completed, and to announce this year's creation plans, is a good one. The Editorial Department of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles will soon publish the completion status of last year's creation plans by literary and art workers in "People's Literature" in succession. This is in reply.

　  关于文艺界检查去年创作计划
    阿丛同志：
    你建议文艺界检查去年年初在《人民文学》等刊物上发表的创作计划完成了多少，并公布本年度的创作计划。你的建议是好的。全国文协编辑部即将把去年文艺工作者所订创作计划的完成情况，陆续发表在《人民文学》上。此复。
