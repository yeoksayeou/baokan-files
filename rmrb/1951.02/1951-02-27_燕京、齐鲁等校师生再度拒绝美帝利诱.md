Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. Recently, the heads of Yenching University in Beijing, Qilu University in Shandong, Huazhong University in Wuchang, and South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Fuzhou have again received telegrams from the "United Board for Christian Colleges in China," controlled by the U.S. State Department. The telegrams stated that as long as the universities were willing to accept American subsidies, the Board could remit the funds. Teachers and students of the universities unanimously expressed contempt and indignation at the American imperialists' vain attempt to continue cultural aggression in China through bribery. Lan Meizhu, a student at South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences, said, "We don't want your stinking money, and we will never be fooled by you again." Teachers and students of the universities are actively registering and organizing school protection and property protection committees as a response to American imperialism.

　　燕京、齐鲁等校师生再度拒绝美帝利诱
    【新华社二十五日讯】最近北京燕京大学、山东齐鲁大学、武昌华中大学、福州华南女子文理学院等校负责人又收到美国国务院控制下的“美国在华基督教大学联合托事部”的电报。电报中说明，只要各校愿意接受美国的津贴，该部即可将款汇来。各校师生对美帝国主义妄想以利诱手段继续在中国进行文化侵略的阴谋，一致表示轻蔑和愤慨。华南女子文理学院学生蓝美珠说：“我们不要你们的臭钱，也决不再上你们的当。”各校师生正积极进行登记和组织护校、护产委员会作为对美帝国主义的回答。
