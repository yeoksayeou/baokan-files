The Beijing Municipal Commemoration of the "March 8th" International Women's Day Preparatory Committee was formally established on February 22nd. The preparatory committee includes 54 units from central, North China, and Beijing municipal organs, parties, and people's organizations. The first preparatory meeting was held on the afternoon of the 22nd at the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. 43 people attended, including Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation. At the meeting, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, was elected as the Director of the Preparatory Committee. A secretariat and three committees for publicity, liaison, and entertainment were established to carry out preparatory work immediately.

The Preparatory Committee decided that the guiding principle for this year's commemoration of "March 8th" is to continue to carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Homeland patriotic movement more widely and deeply among the broad masses of women, oppose the US imperialist plot to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, strengthen women's patriotic and internationalist education, implement the Patriotic Covenant established by the Beijing women's community, and further strengthen ties with the women's masses, and expand and strengthen women's unity.

The Preparatory Committee decided to designate March 1st to 8th as Propaganda Week, during which factories, schools, organs, groups, and districts will hold commemorative meetings, symposiums, lectures, and social gatherings. At the same time, it is planned to hold a reception for Beijing women labor models and military dependents representatives to commend patriotic women and express respect to them. On March 7th, a city-wide representative commemorative meeting will be held, and international friends will be invited to participate. On March 8th, a city-wide women's grand garden party will be held at the Labor People's Cultural Palace, including exhibitions of women's production and women's life pictures, cultural activities, and sports performances.
