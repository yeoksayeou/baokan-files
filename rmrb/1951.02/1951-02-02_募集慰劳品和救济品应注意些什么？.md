What to Pay Attention to When Soliciting Comfort and Relief Goods?
    Chen Ji
    The China Peace Committee, opposing American Imperialism and Defending World Peace, has decided to launch a movement nationwide to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and to provide relief to Korean refugees. This decision is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting hard in the freezing weather, and to the vast number of Korean refugees who lack clothing, food, and shelter in winter; it plays a great role in the rapid elimination of the American imperialist aggressors by the Korean people. This decision represents the flesh-and-blood revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and represents the militant solidarity between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Therefore, this decision has great political significance.
    The work of providing comfort and relief is an important political task and also a mass movement. Through this movement, the broad masses of the people can be educated and their political awareness can be raised. When the broad masses of the people are mobilized, and the spirit of internationalism and patriotism is fully brought into play, they will voluntarily donate and collect a large number of comfort and relief goods. At the same time, through this comfort and relief movement, the ideological education of internationalism and patriotism among the Chinese people can be strengthened, and the sacred movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the home and the country can be carried out more deeply. Therefore, in the propaganda of the comfort and relief movement, the following points should also be noted:
    1. The work of soliciting comfort and relief goods should be closely integrated with propaganda work. Explain to the broad masses of the people that the temporary difficulties and suffering of the Korean people are caused by the barbaric policy of aggression of American imperialism. The American invading army barbarously massacres the Korean people, rapes Korean women, and robs and burns Korean towns and villages. Korean schools, hospitals, churches, and libraries, factories, fields, forests, and tap water have all become targets for the indiscriminate bombing of American aerial bandits. Recently, the American invading army, which suffered a shameful defeat, has been even more frantically bombing, strafing, and burning, looting, and murdering. This unprecedentedly brutal act of aggression by American imperialism can only make the Korean people hate American imperialism even more, and can only strengthen the Korean people's confidence in their inevitable victory in resisting America. American imperialism is the common mortal enemy of the Korean, Chinese, and world's people, and their barbaric policy of aggression has aroused the hatred of all the Chinese, Asian, and world's people (including the American people).
    2. Publicize the strength and brilliant victories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, as well as the unprecedented strength and unity of the world's people's forces for peace. Publicize the inevitable failure of American imperialism. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, crushing the enemy's two frenzied offensives of the "Thanksgiving Offensive" and the "Christmas Offensive," and launched the 1951 New Year Offensive, eliminating a total of more than 55,000 enemy troops, fundamentally breaking the entire American imperialist plan of aggression, further expanding the division and contradictions within the imperialist camp, and also plunging the American ruling class into a state of chaotic infighting. This victory on the Korean battlefield, which has changed world history, fully demonstrates the unparalleled power of the world's people and fully demonstrates the weak and incompetent death throes of American imperialism.
    3. The Korean people will not only be able to defeat the American invading army, but they will certainly be able to overcome the destruction caused to them by American imperialism. The Korean people have already done a lot of great work in this regard. The help of the Chinese people will help them overcome their current difficulties, to resist the cold and hunger of the winter and spring seasons, and to restore transportation and production.
    4. In various possible ways, such as performing dramas, showing movies, organizing propaganda teams, holding meetings, exhibitions, and forums, the propaganda and mobilization of the people should be carried out fully to the people by various democratic parties, people's organizations, relief organizations, and factories, organs, and schools. In the past, the propaganda work of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the home and the country in major cities was generally done more deeply. Now, this comfort and relief movement should be used to carry out more extensive and in-depth propaganda and education of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the home and the country, so that everyone can understand the close relationship between the great victories of the Chinese and Korean People's forces and their own vital interests, and so that everyone can understand the great significance of launching this comfort and relief movement, in order to strengthen the Chinese people's hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. This propaganda work should never be neglected in small and medium-sized cities and the vast countryside.
    5. Providing relief to Korean refugees is an urgent task, and our propaganda work must be launched quickly. Last November, people across the country spontaneously launched a movement to comfort and salute the Chinese and Korean People's forces, which achieved great results. In just over two months, the China Peace Committee, opposing American Imperialism and Defending World Peace, up to January 16, according to incomplete statistics, received a total of more than 6.3 billion yuan in comfort money, more than 250,000 comfort letters, more than 150,000 comfort bags, and more than 300,000 other comfort items. This fully demonstrates the Chinese people's willingness to support Korea. As long as sufficient propaganda work is done in this comfort and relief movement, the Chinese people will inevitably donate quickly and enthusiastically. Therefore, we must avoid any phenomenon of apportionment.
    6. The broad masses of the people should be mobilized to donate according to the specific objective conditions of each locality. For example, the Northeast region is closer to Korea and should focus on collecting food; cotton-producing areas should focus on collecting cotton fabrics; other areas, especially those far from Korea and inconvenient to transport, should collect cash in all cases. When publicizing the solicitation of comfort and relief goods, it is necessary to distinguish these specific conditions, mobilize the masses, and collect goods or cash, so that these comfort and relief goods can be quickly sent to Korea.

　　募集慰劳品和救济品应注意些什么？
    陈迹
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，决定在全国发起慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并救济朝鲜难民的运动。这个决定对于在冰天雪地中艰苦作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，对于在冬天缺少衣被、食粮、房屋的广大的朝鲜难民，是极大的鼓舞和支援；对于朝鲜人民迅速地消灭美帝国主义侵略军，有很大作用。这个决定表示着中朝人民血肉相连的革命友情，表示着中朝人民的战斗团结。因此，这一决定是有重大政治意义的。
    慰劳和救济工作是重要的政治任务，也是群众性的运动。通过这个运动，可以教育广大人民群众，提高群众的政治认识。广大人民群众发动起来，充分发挥国际主义的爱国主义精神，就一定会自愿地起来捐献，就一定会募集大量的慰劳品和救济品。同时，也可以经过这次慰劳、救济运动，加强中国人民国际主义和爱国主义的思想教育，把抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣运动更深入地开展起来。因此，在慰劳、救济运动的宣传方面，还应该注意下列几点：
    一、要把募集慰劳品和救济品的工作密切地与宣传工作结合起来。向广大人民群众说明朝鲜人民暂时的困难和苦痛，是美帝国主义野蛮的侵略政策所造成的。美国侵略军野蛮地屠杀朝鲜人民，强奸朝鲜妇女，抢劫和烧杀朝鲜的城镇和农村。朝鲜的学校、医院、教堂和图书馆，工厂、田野、森林和自来水都成了美国空中强盗滥肆轰炸的目标。最近遭受了可耻失败的美国侵略军更加疯狂地轰炸扫射和烧杀掳掠。美帝国主义这种空前残暴的侵略行为，只有使朝鲜人民更加仇恨美帝国主义，只有使朝鲜人民更加坚定了抗美必胜的信心。美帝国主义是朝鲜、中国和世界人民共同的死敌，他们的野蛮的侵略政策已激起了全中国、全亚洲和全世界人民（包括美国人民）的痛恨。
    二、宣传中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的强大和辉煌胜利，以及全世界人民和平力量空前的强大和团结。宣传美帝国主义的必然失败。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，击溃敌人“感恩节攻势”和“圣诞节攻势”的两次疯狂进攻，并发动了一九五一年新年攻势，总共已消灭敌军五万五千余人，根本打破了美帝国主义整个侵略计划，使得帝国主义阵营内部的分裂和矛盾益形扩大，并且也使得美国统治阶级陷入争吵不已的混乱状态。这个改变了世界历史的朝鲜战场上的胜利，充分说明了世界人民力量无比强大，也充分说明了美帝国主义软弱无能的垂死挣扎。
    三、朝鲜人民不仅能战胜美国侵略军，而且一定能战胜美国侵略军对于朝鲜人民的破坏。朝鲜人民在这方面已经做了很多伟大的工作。中国人民对于他们的帮助，将有助于他们克服当前的困难，来抵抗他们冬春二季的寒冷和饥饿，来恢复交通和生产。
    四、要以各种可能的方式，如演剧、放映电影、组织宣传队、举行集会、展览会和座谈会等，通过各民主党派、各人民团体、救济团体和各工厂、机关、学校、充分地向人民群众进行宣传和动员。过去各大城市抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传工作一般地做得比较深入，现在应该通过这个慰劳、救济运动，更广泛地深入地进行抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传教育，使每个人了解到中朝人民部队的伟大胜利和自己切身利益有着怎样密切的关系，使每个人了解到展开这个慰劳、救济运动的重大意义，借以加强中国人民仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的观念。对于中小城市和广大农村，也决不应忽视这一宣传工作。
    五、救济朝鲜难民，是迫切的工作，我们的宣传工作必须迅速展开。去年十一月间全国各地人民曾经自发地展开慰劳和慰问中朝人民部队的运动，得到了极大的成绩。在短短的两个多月当中，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，至一月十六日止，据不完全的统计，共收到慰劳金六十三亿余元，慰问信二十五万余封，慰问袋十五万余个，其他慰劳品三十万余件。这充分表现了中国人民自愿支援朝鲜的意志。只要在这次慰劳、救济运动中作充分的宣传工作，中国人民是必然会很快地踊跃捐献的。因此我们必须避免任何摊派的现象。
    六、应根据各地方具体的客观条件，动员广大人民群众捐献。例如：东北地区距离朝鲜较近，应以募集食粮为主；产棉地区则以募集棉花布匹为主；其他地区特别是距离朝鲜较远的、运输不方便的地区，一概募集现金。在宣传募集慰劳品和救济品时，就要分清楚这个具体条件，动员群众，募集实物或现金，以便于这些慰劳品和救济品能迅速地送到朝鲜。
