　　New Measures for the Election of People's Representatives in Beijing Municipality

    The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference is about to convene its third session soon. According to the "General Rules for the Organization of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference," the term of office of the representatives of the second session has expired after one year, and a new election is required to elect a new mayor, deputy mayor, and members of the municipal people's government in the third session. To this end, the fourth meeting of the second session of representatives passed the "Measures for the Generation of Representatives of the Third Session of People from All Walks of Life." Now, people from all walks of life are electing their representatives to attend the third session according to this method.

    This new method for generating representatives stipulates:

    "The director of the Military Control Commission, the secretary-general, the mayor of the Municipal People's Government, the deputy mayor, the secretary-general, the directors of the various committees, the directors of the various bureaus, the president of the court, and the procurator-general are government representatives.

    Representatives from the municipal democratic parties, various agencies, and troops shall be elected by their respective units.

    Representatives from the municipal people's organizations shall be elected separately and by region by their respective organizations through election congresses or representative election congresses.

    Representatives from various public-owned industrial and mining enterprises shall be elected by their respective units or a combination of units through election congresses.

    Representatives from units of colleges and universities shall be elected by their respective units or a combination of units through election congresses.

    Regional representatives shall be elected by the people's representative conferences of each district.

    Representatives from other sectors shall be invited by the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government after consultation with the Consultation Committee."

    This new method of generating representatives, compared with the methods of generating representatives of the first and second sessions of the People's Representative Conference, has undergone great changes and improvements.

    The representatives of the third session, in addition to a small number of government representatives and invited representatives, will be elected by holding election congresses or representative election congresses among all organized masses. First, direct elections will be implemented in public-owned industrial and mining enterprises and college and university units, and direct elections or indirect elections will be implemented in other people's organizations. In this way, representatives generated through direct and indirect elections by people from all walks of life will account for more than 85% of the total number of representatives. If we recall that during the first session of the representative conference, we could only nominate representatives from various parties and people's organizations and then have them appointed by the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government; during the second session of the representative conference, we could only generate representatives through consultation and nomination; then, the new method of generating representatives is obviously more complete in terms of both the democratic form and content of the election, and the democratic life of the people of Beijing is more enriched and expanded.

    Precisely because the democratic scope of the election has been expanded, people from all walks of life can choose mass leaders who can better represent their opinions and are supported by them as their representatives. This strengthens the masses' supervision of the representatives, enabling the representatives to contact the broad masses more widely and directly; therefore, the People's Representative Conference can more quickly and effectively concentrate the opinions of the masses and more easily implement resolutions among the masses.

    Beijing is able to move the people's democratic election system forward from the existing foundation because it has certain conditions.

    First, this is inseparable from eliminating the activities of counter-revolutionary elements and establishing revolutionary order. After overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and their concentrated representative, the Kuomintang reactionary government, and establishing a people's democratic dictatorship, it is necessary to suppress the conspiracies of the remaining counter-revolutionaries in order to consolidate the people's political power. In the past year, counter-revolutionary elements in Beijing have suffered severe blows, greatly reducing their opportunities to carry out sabotage activities and paving the way for the continuous progress of the people's political power construction.

    Second, this is inseparable from the formation, development, and consolidation of various people's organizations. In the past year, workers, peasants, women, students, teachers, industrialists and businessmen, literary and art workers, and other freelancers in Beijing have established their own organizations, produced their own leaders and leading backbones, and formed an organized force. At present, there are approximately 700,000 organized people in Beijing, which is equivalent to one-third of the city's population. This force is a powerful foundation for the people's democratic political power.

    Third, this is inseparable from the improvement of the level of awareness of people from all walks of life. Since liberation, through political study and cultural education, the people's level of awareness has generally improved, especially in the recent upsurge of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the homeland, people from all walks of life have more rapidly improved their awareness under the education of patriotism. It can be fully believed that tens of thousands of awakened people can effectively exercise democratic rights according to their own will and desires.

    Fourth, this is inseparable from the close unity of people from all walks of life, various parties, and various nationalities, and it is also inseparable from the consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front. In the past year, in Beijing, in the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, on the economic front of adjusting industry and commerce, balancing financial revenue and expenditure, promoting public bonds, and stabilizing financial prices, in the restoration and development of production, the development of production movements, and in various municipal construction work and unemployment relief work, people from all walks of life have worked together and united to overcome difficulties. The recent massive anti-American demonstrations and parades held by people from all walks of life and all nationalities have further demonstrated that people from all walks of life, various parties, and various nationalities have been more powerfully united in the struggle against common enemies, and consolidating such unity and cooperation is an indispensable condition for promoting the construction of the people's democratic political power.

    This shows that the people of Beijing, in their efforts to carry out various undertakings of capital construction, have gradually formed an organized force, continuously improved their awareness, and continuously overcome difficulties, creating more favorable conditions for the construction of the people's political power. Under such conditions, it is entirely appropriate to formulate and implement this new method of generating representatives. Although this method is not a universal suffrage method, but a transitional, mixed election method, it is a relatively appropriate method at present. At present, implementing direct elections among some organized masses is preparing for future universal suffrage.

    When conducting elections according to this new method of generating representatives, it is necessary to create election methods that are suitable for the current level of awareness of the masses and adapt to their democratic living habits. It must be fully estimated that under the long-term reactionary rule in the past, the masses had no democratic rights and no democratic life to speak of. What they heard and saw were only the ugly acts of the reactionary ruling class manipulating elections and bribing the public; they were forced by the reactionary ruling class to vote and elect those enemies of the people who were pressing down on them and doing evil. At the same time, the democratic forms of the bourgeoisie still have an impact on some people, and the broad masses still lack experience in the democratic forms of the people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, we believe that the new democratic election method, whether in the steps of nominating candidates or elections, should take into account the current political and cultural level of the masses, and should not adopt some methods that they cannot understand and cannot achieve. For example, the nomination of candidates should be carefully discussed by the election committees of various units and groups with the masses, and discussed among the masses, until the list of candidates is fully brewed and accepted by the majority of the masses, before formally conducting the election. The number of candidates nominated on this basis should be equal to the number of representatives, and there is no need to adopt the formalism of having more candidates than representatives. Because if the number of candidates is greater than the number of representatives, it is easy to fail to elect a few representative figures. Through democratic consultation, representatives from all aspects who can represent the opinions of the masses can be more widely elected. For example, in the election, it is best to adopt the method of raising hands for voting. On the one hand, hand-raising elections are relatively simple, and on the other hand, they are more convenient for the masses to supervise the election. However, if some units insist on adopting methods such as nominating more candidates and voting, they should also be handled in accordance with the opinions of the majority of the masses. Because the democratic living habits of the masses are not consistent, and some democratic election methods were fought for and created by the masses in the long-term struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as the way colleges and universities elect student representatives. We should not force them to abandon these election methods. But no matter which method is adopted, full democratic consultation must be carried out in advance. Because democratic consultation is a very important form and content that runs through our democratic system, and it is the key to whether the mass line can be followed well in election work.

    Currently, the election of representatives for the third session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference is underway. Since this work is still a pioneering undertaking, it must be taken seriously and not treated carelessly. If a dismissive or perfunctory attitude is adopted towards it, it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses and cause great losses to the work. Therefore, we hope and request that all groups and units in Beijing must conscientiously do this election work well and create more favorable conditions for the continued progress of the democratic life of the people of Beijing.

### 北京市人民代表选举的新办法

　　北京市人民代表选举的新办法
    北京市各界人民代表会议即将于最近召开第三届会议。根据“市各界人民代表会议组织通则”的规定，第二届会议代表的任期已满一年，需要重新选举，并在第三届会议中选举新的市长、副市长及市人民政府委员。为此，第二届第四次代表会议曾通过了“第三届各界人民代表会议代表产生办法”。现在，各界人民正在根据这个办法来选举他们出席第三届会议的代表。
    这个新的代表产生办法规定：
    “军管会主任、秘书长、市人民政府市长、副市长、秘书长、各委员会主任、各局局长、法院院长、检察长为政府代表。
    市各民主党派、各机关及部队的代表，由各该单位自行选举之。
    市各人民团体的代表，由各该团体分别并划分区域，召开选举大会或选举代表大会自行选举之。
    各公营工矿企业单位的代表，由各该单位或若干单位联合，召开选举大会自行选举之。
    各专科以上学校单位的代表，由各该单位或若干单位联合，召开选举大会自行选举之。
    区域代表由区各界人民代表会议选举之。
    其他方面的代表，经军管会、市人民政府和协商委员会商定，由军管会、市人民政府邀请之。”
    这个新的代表产生办法，与第一、二两届各界人民代表会议代表产生办法相比较，有很大的改变和进步。
    第三届会议的代表，除了很少的政府代表和邀请代表之外，将在所有有组织的群众中，召开选举大会或选举代表大会来选举。首先是在公营工矿企业单位和专科以上学校单位中，实行直接选举，并在其他人民团体中实行直接选举或间接选举。这样，经过各界人民直接选举和间接选举所产生的代表，将占代表总额的百分之八十五以上。如果我们回忆一下，在第一届代表会议时，我们还只能由各党派、各人民团体推选出代表，再经军管会和市人民政府加以聘请；在第二届代表会议时，我们也还只能经过协商、推选，产生代表；那末，新的代表产生办法显然在选举的民主形式和内容方面都更加完备了，北京市人民的民主生活是更加充实与扩大了。
    正因为扩大了选举的民主范围，就使各阶层人民可以选择更能代表他们的意见，并为他们所拥护的群众领袖，作为他们的代表。这就加强了群众对于代表的监督，使代表能够更广泛、更直接地联系广大的群众；因而，各界人民代表会议就能够更迅速，更有效地集中群众的意见，更容易把决议贯彻到群众中去。
    北京市所以能够从现有基础上，将人民民主的选举制度向前推进一步，是由于它具备了一定的条件。
    第一，这是与肃清反革命分子的活动，建立革命秩序分不开的。在推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其集中的代表者国民党反动政府，并建立起人民民主专政的政权以后，必须镇压反革命残余的阴谋活动，才能巩固人民的政权。一年来，北京市的反革命分子已遭受了严重的打击，大大减少了他们进行破坏活动的机会，而为人民政权建设的不断进步铺平了道路。
    第二，这是与各种人民团体的组成、发展与巩固分不开的。一年来，北京市的工人、农民、妇女、学生、教职员、工商业家、文学艺术工作者、以及其他一些自由职业者，都建立了自己的组织，产生了自己的领袖和领导骨干，形成了一支有组织的力量。目前北京市各种有组织的人民约有七十万人，即相当于全市人口的三分之一，这个力量是人民民主政权强有力的基础。
    第三，这是与各阶层人民觉悟程度的提高分不开的。解放以来，经过政治学习和文化教育，人民的觉悟程度普遍地提高了，特别是在最近抗美援朝保家卫国运动的高潮中，各阶层人民在爱国主义的教育下，更迅速地提高了觉悟。可以完全相信，成千成万觉悟了的人民，能够根据他们自己的意志和愿望，有效地行使民主权利。
    第四，这是与各阶层、各党派、各民族的亲密团结，也是与人民民主统一战线的巩固与发展分不开的。一年来，北京市各界人民，在镇压反革命活动中，在调整工商业、平衡财政收支、推销公债、稳定金融物价的经济战线上，在恢复与发展生产、开展生产运动中，在各种市政建设工作和救济失业工作中，各阶层人民都曾同心同德，团结一致不断克服了困难。最近各阶层、各民族人民所举行的声势浩大的反美示威游行，更表现了各阶层、各党派、各民族人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中，已经更有力地团结起来，而巩固这样的团结合作，正是推进人民民主政权建设不可缺少的条件。
    由此可以说明，北京市人民在努力进行首都建设的各种事业中，逐步形成有组织的力量，不断提高觉悟，并不断克服困难，而为人民政权建设创造了更有利的条件。在这样的条件下制定与实行这个新的代表产生办法是完全适合时宜的。这个办法虽然还不是普选的办法，而是一个过渡的、混合选举办法，但是它在目前却是一个较为妥善的办法。而目前在一部分有组织的群众中实行直接选举，正是为将来的普选作准备工作。
    按照这个新的代表产生办法，进行选举的时候，必须创造适合于目前群众的觉悟程度、并与他们的民主生活习惯相适应的选举方式。必须充分估计到，在过去长期反动统治下，群众是没有民主权利、没有什么民主生活可言的。他们所耳闻目见的只是反动统治阶级操纵选举、贿赂公行的种种丑态；他们曾被反动统治阶级强迫去投票，选举那些压在他们头上、为非作恶的人民的敌人。同时，资产阶级的民主形式对于一部分人也仍有影响，广大群众对于人民民主专政的民主形式，则仍缺少经验。因此，我们认为新的民主选举方法，无论在提出候选人、选举等步骤上，均应照顾到群众现时的政治水平和文化水平，不应采取为他们所不能了解的和作不到的一些办法。比如提出候选人，应该由各单位、各团体的选举委员会与群众慎重协商，并在群众中加以讨论，直到候选人名单酝酿成熟、为大多数群众所接受之后，再正式进行选举。在这样的基础上提出来的候选人的名额以与代表的名额相等为宜，而不必采取候选名额一定多于代表名额的形式主义的办法。因为候选人名额如果多于代表名额，容易使少数的但有代表性的人物选不出来。经过民主协商，则可以更广泛地选出各方面能代表群众意见的代表。再如选举，目前以一律采取举手表决的方法为好。这一方面是由于举手选举比较简便，另一方面也为了更便于群众监督选举。但是，如果有些单位，坚持采取多提候选人和投票选举等办法，也应按照多数群众的意见办理。因为群众的民主生活习惯还不一致，且有些民主选举的方式是群众与国民党反动派长期斗争中所争取所创造出来的，例如专科以上学校选举学生会代表的方式等。对于这些选举方式我们不应强求他们放弃。但无论采取那一种方式，事前必须经过充分的民主协商。因为民主协商是贯串于我们的民主制度中的极重要的形式和内容，是在选举工作中能否走好群众路线的关键。
    现在，北京市第三届各界人民代表会议的代表正在选举。由于这项工作还是一个创举，故必须郑重其事，不可草率。如果对它采取漠视或敷衍的态度，就将招致群众的不满，使工作受到很大损失。因此，我们希望并且要求北京市各团体各单位必须认真做好这项选举工作，为北京市人民的民主生活的继续前进创造更有利的条件。
