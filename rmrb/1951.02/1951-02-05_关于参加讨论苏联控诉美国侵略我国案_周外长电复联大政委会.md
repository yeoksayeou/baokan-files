Regarding Participation in the Discussion of the Soviet Union's Accusation Against the United States of Aggression Against China

Foreign Minister Zhou's Telegram Reply to the UN General Assembly Political Committee

Indicates that it is unreasonable for the committee not to notify China in advance, resulting in our representative's inability to attend the discussion; and proposes that this reply and Wu Xiuquan's speech be issued as official documents.

[Xinhua News Agency, February 4th] The Chairman of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, U Thant, telegraphed our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, on the 2nd of this month, stating that the committee had met on the afternoon of the 2nd to continue the discussion of the "Soviet Union's Accusation Against the United States of America of Aggression Against China" case, and that its next meeting was scheduled for February 6th. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai replied today, pointing out that under the manipulation of the United States government, the First Committee, after illegally passing the US slanderous proposal against China, suddenly resumed the discussion of the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of America of aggression against China on February 2nd, without notifying our government in advance, resulting in our representative's inability to attend and participate in the discussion, which is completely unreasonable. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai formally proposed that at the First Committee's meeting on February 6, 1951, the speech manuscript previously submitted by the representative of the People's Republic of China, Wu Xiuquan, to the United Nations Secretary-General, and this reply should be read by the United Nations Secretariat and issued as official documents. The original text of the reply is as follows:

New York, USA
United Nations Secretariat, forwarded to
Mr. U Thant, Chairman of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly:

Your telegram (56) of February 2, 1951, has been received.

On November 24, 1950, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend and participate in the discussion of the accusation against the United States of America of aggression against China. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China accepted the invitation of the First Committee and appointed Wu Xiuquan, the special representative attending the Security Council meeting, to also serve as the representative attending the First Committee to participate in the discussion of the case. However, due to the manipulation of the United States government, the First Committee interrupted and delayed the discussion of the accusation against the United States of America of aggression against China. Our representative waited for a long time and never got a chance to speak, so he had to leave New York and return to China on December 19, 1950. Before returning to China, Representative Wu Xiuquan had already submitted a copy of his speech manuscript supporting the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of aggression against China to the United Nations Secretariat.

Now, under the manipulation of the United States government, the First Committee, after illegally passing the US slanderous proposal against China, suddenly resumed the discussion of the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of America of aggression against China on February 2, 1951, without notifying our government in advance, resulting in our representative's inability to attend and participate in the discussion, which is completely unreasonable. This is another new trick by the United States government to manipulate United Nations agencies. I now formally propose to you that at the First Committee's meeting on February 6, 1951, the above-mentioned speech manuscript of the representative of the People's Republic of China, Wu Xiuquan, and this reply should be read by the United Nations Secretariat and issued as official documents. I hereby send this telegram, hoping that you will take note.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
February 4, 1951, in Beijing

　　关于参加讨论苏联控诉美国侵略我国案        
    周外长电复联大政委会
    指出该会未事先通知我国以致我代表不能出席讨论是不合理的；并提出应把这一复电和伍修权的发言词作正式文件印发。
    【新华社四日讯】联合国大会第一委员会主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹于本月二日致电我外交部周恩来部长，称该委员会已于二日下午开会继续讨论《苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟控诉美利坚合众国侵略中国》案，其下一次会议定于二月六日举行。我周恩来外长于本日复电指出第一委员会在美国政府操纵之下，非法通过美国诬蔑我国提案之后，突然于二月二日恢复对苏联控诉美利坚合众国侵略中国的讨论，而事先并未通知我国政府，以致我国代表不可能出席参加讨论，这是完全不合理的。周恩来外长并正式提出：在第一委员会一九五一年二月六日的会议上，中华人民共和国代表伍修权前送交联合国秘书处的发言稿和这一复电应由联合国秘书处宣读，并请作正式文件印发。复电原文如下：
    美国纽约
    联合国秘书处转
    联合国大会第一委员会主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹先生：
    一九五一年二月二日你的（五六）来电，谨悉。
    一九五零年十一月二十四日联合国大会第一委员会曾通过邀请中华人民共和国代表出席参加讨论对美利坚合众国侵略中国控诉案。中华人民共和国中央人民政府接受了第一委员会的邀请，任命了出席安全理事会会议特派代表伍修权兼任出席第一委员会参加讨论该案的代表。但是，由于美国政府的操纵，第一委员会中断并拖延了对美国侵略中国控诉案的讨论。我国代表等待了很长的时间，始终没有得到说话的机会，因此不得不于一九五零年十二月十九日离开纽约返国。在返国以前，伍修权代表已将其准备在第一委员会发表的关于支持苏联控诉美国侵略中国的发言稿交给联合国秘书处一份。
    现在，第一委员会在美国政府操纵之下非法通过美国诬蔑我国提案之后，突于一九五一年二月二日恢复对苏联控诉美利坚合众国侵略中国案的讨论，而事先并未通知我国政府，以致我国代表不可能出席参加讨论，这是完全不合理的。这是美国政府操纵联合国机构又一新的诡计。我现在向你正式提出：在第一委员会一九五一年二月六日的会议上，中华人民共和国代表伍修权的上述发言稿和这一复电，应由联合国秘书处宣读，并请作为正式文件印发。特此电达，希即查照。
                 中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
                                 一九五一年二月四日于北京
