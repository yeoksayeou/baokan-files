[News from Our Newspaper] The China Education Union has achieved considerable success in developing union organizations, leading members in study, and carrying out welfare work in the six months since its establishment in August 1950.

At present, the China Education Union has 351,036 members. Education Union offices have been established in all six major administrative regions except the Southwest Administrative Region. Thirty-eight provincial and municipal (directly administered municipalities) level unions have been established, accounting for 72 percent of all provinces and municipalities. According to statistics from 32 provinces and cities, there are already 7,695 grassroots unions.

In the past six months, the Education Union has launched current affairs education and patriotic propaganda movements nationwide, focusing on resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country. First, it conducted a comprehensive reckoning of the erroneous psychology of fearing and admiring America, and the reactionary pro-American ideas of educators themselves. Through recollections, accusations, speeches, reports, forums, discussions, and other methods, it enabled the broad masses of educators to initially establish the correct thinking of hating, despising, and belittling America. In this great patriotic movement, many elderly professors in their sixties and seventies went to factories and rural areas with students to carry out current affairs propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country among the broad masses of workers and peasants, and were warmly welcomed by the workers and peasants. At the same time, local education unions have also done a lot of work in comforting the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and in mobilizing young students to participate in military cadre schools.

Leading and organizing teachers' study to improve teaching is a major task of the Education Union, as resolved at the First National Congress of Education Workers in August last year. In the past six months, the most successful aspect of teachers' study has been the current affairs study centered on resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country. Regarding teachers' cultural and professional studies, in the past six months, some relatively mature experiences and specific methods have been gained mainly in the study of primary school teachers scattered in rural villages. These experiences mainly involve the establishment of professional correspondence networks, spare-time study classes, and mobile libraries. These were conceived by rural primary school teachers based on their actual needs, from overcoming learning difficulties. The Education Union of the Eleventh District of Yuxian County, Chahar Province, in order to meet the cultural needs of its members, pooled money to buy 32 books, which were circulated among everyone, initially solving the problem of rural teachers' difficulty in reading.

The welfare of teachers is also an important link in doing a good job of the union and enabling teachers to teach with peace of mind. At a time when teachers' (especially rural primary school teachers') material lives are still difficult, it is necessary to do everything possible to help them solve some of their living difficulties. The National Committee has sent working groups to the countryside to Wutai County, Shanxi Province to try out the "publicly-run, privately-assisted" method for rural primary schools, which has proved that this method meets the needs of the masses and should be promoted to all regions. In this way, it can also help solve the livelihood problems of rural primary school teachers. According to local experience, organizing mutual aid societies and cooperatives is also a method. For example, members who join the mutual aid society only need to pay a very small portion of their monthly salary each month, and can enjoy loans or relief when they encounter difficulties. In order to solve the childcare problems of female teachers, some schools in large cities such as Shenyang, Beijing, Harbin, Dalian, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Nanjing have also begun to set up nurseries or day care centers.

Based on the work experience and development situation in the past six months, the National Committee of the China Education Union plans to increase the number of members to 500,000 by the end of 1951, and consolidate existing grassroots organizations. Continue to carry out and deepen the current affairs propaganda movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, and systematically organize and lead the study of educational workers. In terms of wages and living standards, it is necessary to suggest that the administrative side make improvements, and suggest the implementation of public-run and private-assisted, or private-run and public-assisted methods to ensure the minimum living standards of rural primary school teachers, and further develop the welfare work of teachers.

　　中国教育工会工作获成绩
    半年来发展会员三十五万
　　普遍展开了抗美援朝爱国主义时事学习
    【本报讯】中国教育工会从一九五○年八月成立后，半年来，在发展工会组织，领导会员学习和开展福利工作等方面均已获得相当成绩。
    目前中国教育工会已有会员三十五万一千零三十六人，全国六大行政区除西南行政区外，均已成立了教育工会办事处，省市（直辖市）级工会成立的已有三十八处，占全部省市的百分之七十二，基层工会根据三十二省市的统计，已有七千六百九十五处。
    半年来教育工会在全国范围展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的时事教育和爱国宣传运动。首先对于教育工作者本身的恐美、崇美的错误心理与亲美的反动思想，通过回忆、控诉、演讲、报告、座谈、讨论等方式，作了总清算，使广大的教育工作者初步树立了仇美、鄙美、蔑美的正确思想。在这次伟大的爱国运动中，许多六七十岁高龄的老教授都和学生们一道深入工厂、农村，对广大的工人农民进行了抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传，得到工农群众的热烈欢迎。同时在慰问中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军方面与动员青年学生参加军事干部学校方面，各地教育工会也做了很多工作。
    领导与组织教师的学习从而搞好教学业务是教育工会的一个重大任务，在去年八月第一次全国教育工作者代表大会上曾经作了决议。半年来教师们在学习中最有成绩的，是以抗美援朝保家卫国为中心的时事学习。关于教师们的文化业务学习，半年来主要的是在散处乡村的小学教师们的学习问题上，取得了一些比较成熟的经验和具体的办法。这些经验主要是成立业务通讯网，业余学习班和流动图书馆。这是乡村小学教师根据自己的实际需要，从克服学习困难中想出来的。察哈尔蔚县十一区教育工会为了满足会员的文化要求，共同凑钱买了三十二本书，大家轮流传阅，初步解决了乡村教师读书困难的问题。
    关于教师的福利问题，这也是搞好工会工作使教师安心教学的重要一环。在目前教师（尤其是乡村小学教师）的物质生活还有困难的情况下，尽力帮助他们解决一些生活上的困难是很必要的。全国委员会曾派工作组下乡到山西五台县试行乡村小学“公办民助”的办法，证明这种办法是合乎群众要求的，应该推广到各地区。这样一方面也可帮助解决乡村小学教员生活问题。根据各地的经验，组织互助会和合作社也是一个办法。例如加入互助会的会员，每月只须缴纳月薪的极微小的一部分，遇到困难时即可享受贷款或救济。为了解决女教师的育儿问题，沈阳、北京、哈尔滨、大连、武汉、上海、南京等大城市的一些学校也都开始设立了托儿所或日间托儿间。
    根据半年来的工作经验和发展情况，中国教育工会全国委员会计划在一九五一年年底将发展会员到五十万人，并巩固现有基层组织。继续开展并深入抗美援朝的时事宣传运动，有计划地组织并领导教育工作者的学习，在工资及生活待遇方面，要建议行政方面给以改善，并建议推行公办民助，或民办公助办法，以保证乡村小学教师们的最低生活，并进一步开展教师的福利工作。
