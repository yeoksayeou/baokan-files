Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th: According to TASS, London's Hampstead Town Hall held its largest gathering in years on the 5th, protesting the British Labour government's policy of capitulating to the United States in expanding its aggressive adventures in the Far East. The rally was initiated by the "Committee for Peace with China." Many people spoke at the meeting.

　　Martin, editor of the magazine "New Statesman and Nation," said: The latest issue of "New Statesman and Nation" published a letter from Labour Party commentator Cole, who frankly criticized U.S. foreign policy and warned against allowing Britain to be dragged into war by the United States. Cole said: If Britain is dragged into war against China by the United States, he will stand on China's side. He also believes that enough of his compatriots in Britain will do the same. Martin reported to the assembly that Cole's letter had received the support of hundreds of letters.

　　Lieutenant Colonel Collins, who formerly served on MacArthur's headquarters staff, reported on the atrocities committed by Syngman Rhee's elements in Korea. Collins said: "What is happening on this battlefield brings shame to our country and brings death to the Korean people."

　　Labour MP Bing En pointed out in his speech that the countries in the United Nations that voted against the U.S. aggressive policy represent the majority of the world's population.

　　Other speakers at the meeting said: Britain must not be influenced to fight against China. Some people at the meeting also protested against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan.

　　The meeting unanimously passed a resolution expressing deep dissatisfaction with the British government's support in the United Nations for the U.S. proposal condemning China as an "aggressor."

　　不满英政府屈从美国对我诬蔑
    伦敦人士集会抗议
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：伦敦汉普斯泰德市政厅五日举行了多年以来在该厅举行过的最盛大的一次集会，抗议英国工党政府屈从美国在远东扩大侵略冒险的政策。集会是由“对中国和平委员会”发起的。许多人在会上发了言。
    “新政治家与民族”杂志编辑马丁说：最近一期“新政治家与民族”曾发表工党政论家柯尔的一封信，他直率地批评美国的外交政策，并警告不要让英国被美国拖入战争。柯尔曾说：如果英国被美国拖入对中国的战争，他将站在中国一边。他并相信英国会有足够多的同胞也将如此。马丁向大会报告：柯尔的这封信已经得到数百封信的支持。
    曾任麦克阿瑟总部参谋的柯林斯中校在会上报告了李承晚分子在朝鲜的暴行。柯林斯说：“在这个战场上发生的事情使我们的国家蒙受耻辱，使朝鲜人民招致死亡。”
    工党议员炳恩在演说中指出，在联合国投票反对美国侵略政策的国家，代表着世界上大多数的人口。
    会上其他发言的人说：英国一定不要受到影响而对中国作战。会上并有人抗议重新武装西德和日本。
    集会一致通过决议，对英国政府在联合国支持谴责中国为“侵略者”的美国提案深表不满。
