　　Cooperatives Must Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Fertilizer Supply
    The spring plowing season is approaching. The Government Administration Council has already announced the "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951," requiring increased grain production, as well as economic crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and sugar, tea, etc., on the basis of last year's increased production. Therefore, ensuring fertilizer supply in a timely manner becomes an important task to achieve the goal of increased production. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives, together with the China Native Produce Company, has planned and arranged the fertilizer supply for spring plowing. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government recently notified the Northeast Railway Administration to fully guarantee the allocation of sufficient vehicles according to the plan, and to complete the entry of bean cake as an important task.

    This year's fertilizer supply scale is unprecedented. Cooperatives in various regions should combine with the development of cooperative business and do the following tasks in a timely and conscientious manner.

    First, fertilizer supply should be focused and not evenly distributed. It is necessary to recognize that economic crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and sugar especially need fertilizer. Insufficient supply will not meet the requirements for increased production, so it is necessary to focus on the supply of economic crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and sugar. Counties, districts, townships, and even individual farmers must also adjust according to their actual needs. The policy of rewarding "organization" should also be reflected in the fertilizer supply. Appropriate preferential measures should be formulated for labor mutual aid groups, and supplies should be provided as much as possible. At the same time, in-depth publicity and explanations should be carried out to farmers through various organizations and meetings, and the fertilizer supply plan should be well integrated with farmers' production increase plans and actual fertilizer needs.

    Second, the cooperative is responsible for supplying fertilizers, entrusted by the government, so it cannot use the practice of "mainly serving members" but must take care of all farmers in the key distribution areas. Because in some areas, cooperative members account for less than 10% of the population. Focusing on members will relax the fertilizer supply to ordinary farmers and hinder the overall requirement for increased production. In carrying out this work, it is necessary to convene farmers' representative meetings in the whole village, district, and county to jointly discuss the supply plan. Under the principle of overall planning and consideration, cooperative members can be given priority in supply, and members can also be given appropriate preferential treatment in price according to the interest rates of state-owned trade institutions and banks, to attract farmers to participate in cooperatives.

    Third, master capital turnover. According to the current fertilizer supply and transfer plan, the quantity of bean cake and chemical fertilizer is guaranteed. However, due to insufficient fertilizer funds, various regions should have a good grasp of capital turnover to ensure timely supply. Therefore, cooperatives at all levels must pay attention to: First, the fertilizer funds allocated by the government must be used for special purposes in the fertilizer demand season. Second, after last year's bumper harvest, farmers have some savings, so they can adopt the method of spot purchase and spot sale as much as possible to speed up fertilizer capital turnover. Some areas collectively refer to fertilizer supply as "fertilizer loans," emphasizing lending, which will inevitably result in backlog of funds, inflexible turnover, and failure to achieve timely supply, which is not good. Third, special care should be given to particularly poor farmers. The method is to provide loans to them through democratic evaluation and according to certain procedures, under the condition of borrowing and repaying, so that they can actively complete the task of spring plowing and increasing production like other farmers.

    Finally, it must be pointed out that fertilizer is a major task related to the overall production increase plan of all farmers and the country. This work must be carried out with a positive and responsible spirit. Party, government, and financial committees at all levels must also strengthen leadership, conduct systematic and strict supervision and inspection to ensure the completion of this task.

### 合作社要认真做好肥料供应工作

　　合作社要认真做好肥料供应工作
    春耕季节，即将到来，政务院已经公布了“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”，要求在去年增产的基础上，增产粮食，以及棉花、麻、烟、糖、茶等经济作物。因此，不违农时，保证肥料供应，就成为达成增产任务的重要工作。全国合作社联合总社已与中国土产公司，有计划地布置了春耕的肥料供应工作；中央人民政府铁道部最近并通知东北所属铁路管理局，要全力保证按计划拨足车辆，将进关豆饼当作重要任务来完成。
    今年肥料供应规模之大是空前的，各地合作社应结合合作社业务的发展，及时地认真做好下列几件工作。
    第一是肥料供应要有重点，不能平均分配。必须认识经济作物如棉、麻、烟、糖等特别需要肥料，供给少了即不能达到增产的要求，因而必须以棉、麻、烟、糖等经济作物的产品为重点供应区。各县、区、乡以至各个农户，也必须根据其实际需要加以调剂。在肥料供应问题上也应体现奖励“组织起来”的政策，对劳动互助组应订出适当的优待办法，尽量供应。同时应通过各种组织，各种会议向农民进行深入的宣传解释，将肥料供应计划与农民的增产计划及实际需要肥料情况很好地结合起来。
    第二，合作社负责供应肥料，是受政府的委托，因此就不能用“以社员为主”的作法，而必须照顾重点分配区的全体农民。因为有的地区，社员还占不到人口百分之十，以社员为主便会放松对一般农民的肥料供给，妨碍了整个增产的要求。在进行这项工作中，必须召开全村、全区、全县的农民代表会议，共同商讨供应计划。在兼筹并顾原则下，对合作社社员可以优先供应，也可以根据国营贸易机构和银行利率在价格上给予社员以适当优待，目的是吸引农民参加合作社。
    第三，掌握资金周转。根据目前肥料的供应和调运计划，豆饼与化学肥料在数量上是有保证的。但肥料资金不足，各地应很好掌握资金周转，务使作到供应及时，因此各级合作社必须注意：一、政府所拨肥料资金，在需肥季节必须专款专用。二、经过去年丰收之后，农民多少已有一些积蓄，这样就可以尽可能采取现购现售的办法，加速肥料资金周转。有的地区统称肥料供应为“肥贷”，强调贷放，其结果一定是积压资金，周转不灵，不能作到及时供应，这是不好的。三、但对特别贫苦的农民应予适当照顾。办法是通过民主评议，按照一定手续，在有借有还的条件下，予以贷放，使他们也能与其他农民一样积极地完成春耕增产的任务。
    最后，必须指出，肥料是关系全体农民和国家整个增产计划的重大任务。必须以积极负责的精神进行这一工作，各级党、政和财委也必须加强领导，进行有系统的严格的督促检查，保证这一任务的完成。
