　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st: An introduction to the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 73 has been published.
    The editorial of this issue is entitled "For Peace, Democracy, and Socialism." The editorial summarizes the great victories of the peace, democracy, and anti-imperialist camp in 1950 and the completely opposite disintegration of the imperialist camp, the war camp. The editorial points out that 1950 was a year of tenacious struggle by the people of all countries for peace, and a year of unprecedented development in the world peace movement. In the Soviet Union, the bastion of peace and democracy, the people of all nationalities have achieved significant successes in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, and the Soviet people are advancing towards communism with full confidence. China, the cornerstone of peace and security in the Far East, is undergoing a great reform of its social and economic system, inspiring the peoples of Asia oppressed by imperialism to fight for freedom and independence. People's democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania are growing stronger day by day with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and are striving for the victory of socialism in their countries. The German Democratic Republic, the bastion of peace in Europe, is actively fighting against the imperialists' attempt to turn West Germany into a springboard for a new war, and to unite all German people into a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The heroic Korean people, who have suffered a despicable attack by the American aggressors, are holding high the banner of liberation struggle and inflicting devastating blows on the enemy. Fighting side by side with the Korean people are the glorious sons of the Chinese people, who, at a critical moment, gave their neighbors fraternal assistance. The peoples of Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines, these dependent and colonial countries, are continuing their unremitting struggle for freedom and national independence. The editorial points out that, on the other hand, in 1950, American imperialists shifted from a policy of preparing for aggression to a naked act of aggression by invading Korea and China. Domestically, they intensified the brutal exploitation of the working people. In the Marshallized countries, Truman and his running dogs in Western Europe are actively pursuing Hitler's policy of "guns instead of butter," causing the living standards of the working people to decline. The imperialists are also using terror to suppress the growth of democratic and peaceful forces. The editorial points out that the working class in capitalist countries is responding to the imperialists with greater vigilance and solidarity. They are fully determined to prevent a new world war. The growth and strengthening of the Communist and Workers' Parties is a guarantee that the people of all countries will achieve new successes in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have formed a single and solid front, stepping into the second half of the twentieth century. The editorial points out that this great transformation, which has changed the face of the world in the first half of the twentieth century, is a clear demonstration of the power of the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology. The Communist Parties of all countries, which are fighting with all their strength for the victory of the cause of world peace, will undoubtedly win new successes in 1951. The forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war! The twentieth century is the century of Lenin and Stalin. The twentieth century will be the century of the victory of communism over the heinous capitalist enslavement.
    This issue prominently features Romanov's essay, "The Fighting Tradition of Leninism's 'Iskra.'" It also contains essays such as "The Decline of the French Economy and the Tasks of the French Working Class" by French General Confederation of Labor Secretary-General Frachon, and "The First Five-Year Plan of the Romanian People's Republic" by Constantinescu.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第七十三期介绍
    【新华社一日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》中文版第七十三期已出版。
    该刊本期社论题为《为了和平、民主和社会主义》。社论总结了一九五○年和平民主反帝阵营的伟大胜利和与此完全相反的帝国主义阵营、战争阵营的分崩离析的景象。社论指出，一九五○年是各国人民为了和平而顽强斗争的一年，是世界和平运动空前发展的一年。在和平民主的堡垒——苏联，各族人民在政治、经济与文化生活的各方面，都获得了重大的成就，苏维埃人民正满怀信心地向着共产主义前进。远东和平和安全的砥柱中国，正在进行社会与经济制度的伟大改革，鼓舞了受帝国主义压迫的亚洲各族人民，来为自由和独立而斗争。波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿等人民民主国家，在苏联大公无私的援助下一天天地强壮，正在为它们国家里社会主义的胜利而奋斗。欧洲和平的堡垒德意志民主共和国，正在积极战斗来反对帝国主义者把西德变成新战争的跳板的图谋，来争取把一切德意志人民团结到一个统一的、民主的和爱好和平的德国里来。遭受到美国侵略者卑劣攻击的英勇的朝鲜人民，高举着解放斗争的旗帜，给敌人以毁灭性的打击。和朝鲜人民并肩作战的则有中国人民的光荣的儿子们，他们在严重的关头，给予了他们的邻邦以兄弟般的援助。越南、马来亚、印度尼西亚、菲律宾这些附属国和殖民地国家的人民，正在继续不懈的斗争，争取自由与民族独立。社论指出，在另一方面，一九五○年美国帝国主义者从准备侵略的政策转入侵略朝鲜和中国的赤裸裸的侵略行动。在国内则加强对劳动人民的残酷的剥削。在马歇尔化了的国家中，杜鲁门及其在西欧的走狗们正积极奉行希特勒的“大炮代替黄油”的政策，使劳动人民的生活标准每况愈下。帝国主义者并用恐怖来抑制民主和平力量的生长。社论指出，资本主义国家中的工人阶级，正以更大的警惕与团结来回答帝国主义者。他们具有充分的决心，来防止一个新的世界战争。共产党与工人党的成长和加强，是各族人民将在争取和平、民主、社会主义的斗争中，获致新的成就的保证。和平、民主、社会主义的力量结成一个单一而坚固的阵线，踏进了二十世纪的下半世纪。社论指出，在二十世纪的前半世纪，改变了世界面貌的这个伟大的转变，乃是所向无敌的马列主义思想威力的明证。以其全力为争取世界和平事业的胜利而斗争的世界各国的共产党，在一九五一年无疑地会赢得新的成功。和平的力量一定战胜战争的力量！二十世纪是列宁——斯大林世纪。二十世纪将是共产主义的胜利压倒万恶的资本主义奴役的世纪。
    该刊本期以显著地位刊登了罗曼诺夫所作《列宁主义的〈火星〉报的战斗传统》的论文。另外登载了法国总工会总书记佛拉商的《法国经济的凋零与法国工人阶级的任务》、康斯坦丁纳斯古的《罗马亚尼人民共和国的第一个五年计划》等论文。
