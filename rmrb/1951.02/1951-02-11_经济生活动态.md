            Tianjin Trade Union Work Saw Great Development Last Year
    Tianjin's trade union work saw great development in the past year. The most important achievement was the implementation of the principle of "trade union work oriented towards production." Trade unions in public enterprises led workers in carrying out production movements. Dozens of major industrial products such as steel ingots, wire rods, electrodes, yarn, and cloth all completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas. The annual output of cotton mills even created an unprecedented record in Tianjin's history. Trade unions in private enterprises led workers to actively unite with capitalists, establish labor-capital consultation meetings, and improve production. Trade unions in some private factories also led workers in launching production competition movements. For example, yarn factories such as Beiyang and Hengyuan launched the "Red Flag Movement." As a result of the production competition, the unit output of yarn produced by Beiyang last year became the highest among private yarn factories in the country. In 1950, a total of more than 87,600 new members were developed in the city. To date, the city has 280,000 members, accounting for 67 percent of the total number of employees. To date, 84,200 employees in 160 public enterprises in the city and 250,000 family members of employees have received labor insurance benefits. Last year, trade union organizations assisted the government in running 192 amateur schools, with 71,300 employees enrolled.
            People's Bank of China South China Branch Clears Public Bonds of South China Guerrilla Areas Before Liberation
    The South China Branch of the People's Bank of China issued a notice on January 22, designating branches in Guangzhou, Chao-Shan, and Xing-Mei to clear the Victory Public Bonds issued in the South China guerrilla areas before liberation. In August 1949, the South China Guerrilla Column issued Victory Public Bonds in order to welcome the southward march of the army to liberate South China, and formed the South China Victory Public Bond Sales Committee to be responsible for the sales. The South China guerrilla areas, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas patriotic compatriots all enthusiastically purchased them at that time. Now that South China has been liberated for a year, in order to fulfill the provisions of the issuance of public bonds, the sales committee has submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for instructions: From January 20 to the end of February, the South China Branch of the People's Bank of China will be responsible for clearing the Victory Public Bonds, and the original repayment of principal and interest within two years will be changed to a one-time repayment.
            Yellow River Ice Flood Breach Stops Expanding
    On the 3rd of this month, the dikes of the Yellow River below Lijin, Shandong, between Wangjiazhuang (under the jurisdiction of Lijin County) and Qianzuo (under the jurisdiction of Kenli County) breached due to ice block congestion raising the water level. The water flow has now slowed down, and both ends of the breach have been blocked, no longer expanding. Most of the houses in the disaster area have not collapsed, and the loss of grain and materials is not large. At present, the ice jam in the river channel below the breach is still very serious. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Shandong Provincial People's Government are actively planning the breaching work. An explosion team has blasted open 150 meters long and 30 meters wide of ice. Two more explosion teams were sent on the 5th of this month.
            Qinghe Woolen Mill's Production Exceeded the Plan Last Year
    In 1950, the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing produced products worth 38 million jin of millet, exceeding the original plan by 25 percent. In the first half of 1950, the factory was still in a state of low production, sluggish business, and losses due to goods being stocked in warehouses. Due to the national financial and economic unification and price stability, the factory implemented democratic management in June, launched a production competition, and implemented a reward system, which fundamentally changed the factory's paralyzed state. Finally, it exceeded the annual production plan and successfully delivered the national task of 2 million jin of millet. At the victory celebration party of the factory last month, it was proposed that the production volume in 1951 should exceed 192 percent of that in 1950. Moreover, attention should be paid to quality, reduce costs, and overcome the waste of raw materials, so as to further improve production on the existing basis.

            天津工会工作去年有很大发展
    天津市工会工作在去年一年中有了很大的发展。最主要的成绩是贯彻了“工会工作面向生产”的方针。公营企业工会领导工人开展生产运动。主要工业产品如钢锭、盘条、电极、纱、布等数十种都已提前超额完成了全年生产计划。棉纺织厂年产量更创造了天津历史上的空前纪录。私营企业工会则领导工人主动积极地团结资方，建立劳资协商会议，搞好生产。部分私营工厂的工会也领导工人开展了生产竞赛运动。如北洋、恒源等纱厂就开展了“红旗运动”。生产竞赛的结果，北洋去年所产的纱的单位产量成为全国私营纱厂之冠。一九五○年中，全市共发展会员八万七千六百余人。至目前止全市会员已达二十八万，占职工总数百分之六十七。至今该市已有一百六十个公营企业的八万四千二百余职工及二十五万职工家属受到劳动保险的待遇。去年一年，工会组织协助政府举办了一百九十二处业余学校，有七万一千三百名职工入学。
            人民银行华南分行清理解放前华南游击区公债
    中国人民银行华南分区行于一月二十二日发出通告，指定广州、潮汕、兴梅各地分行清理解放前华南游击区所发行的胜利公债。一九四九年八月，华南游击纵队为了迎接大军南下解放华南，发行了胜利公债，并组成华南胜利公债推销委员会负责推销。华南游击区、香港、澳门及海外爱国同胞，当时都踊跃购买。现华南解放已经一年，为履行公债发行之规定，该推销委员会已经呈奉政务院财政经济委员会批示：自一月二十日起至二月底止，由人民银行华南分区行负责清理此项胜利公债，并将原定还本付息期限二年改为一次还清。
            黄河凌汛决口处停止扩展
    本月三日，黄河山东利津以下王家庄（利津县属）和前左（垦利县属）之间的堤防因冰块壅塞抬高了水位而致决口。现水势已渐缓，决口两端已被堵住，不再扩展。灾区房屋大部未倒塌，粮物损失不大。目前决口处以下河槽冰塞仍很严重，黄河水利委员会与山东省人民政府正在积极筹划堵口工作，爆炸队已炸开该处凌长一百五十公尺，宽三十公尺。本月五日又增派两个爆炸队前往。
            清河制呢厂去年生产超过计划
    北京清河制呢厂一九五○年生产了价值三千八百万斤小米的产品，超额完成了原定计划的百分之二十五。一九五○年上半年时，该厂还陷于生产低落，营业清淡，货物囤满仓库的赔钱状况。由于全国财经统一，物价稳定，六月份该厂又实行了民主管理，开展生产竞赛，实行奖励制度，便根本改变了该厂的痪瘫状态。终于超额完成了全年的生产计划，并胜利地交了国家二百万斤小米的任务。上月该厂庆祝胜利联欢大会上，提出一九五一年的生产量要超过一九五○年的百分之一百九十二。而且要注意质量，减低成本，和克服原料上的浪费现象，把生产在现有基础上再提高一步。
