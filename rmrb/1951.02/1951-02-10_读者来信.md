            Bo'ai Mechanized Farm Examined Bureaucratic Work Style
    Editor:
    During this rectification campaign, the state-owned Bo'ai Mechanized Farm examined the bureaucratic work style of its leadership, which mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    1. In terms of administrative leadership, they did not humbly accept the rationalization proposals of the workers in production work. Last autumn harvest, the farm's soybeans were not fully mature, but the task of planting wheat had already arrived, so it was decided to harvest the beans early. At the same time, most of the more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields were also mature. The workers proposed dividing the labor force into two parts to harvest beans and pick cotton simultaneously. The administrative leadership did not adopt the workers' opinions and organized the entire labor force to harvest beans. As a result, a portion of the mature cotton that should have been picked was beaten down by the rain, resulting in significant losses.
    When the season for planting corn had passed, the administrative side did not listen to the workers' opinions and planted more than 400 mu of corn, which only grew to be more than two feet tall. The corn harvest was not even enough to cover the consumption of gasoline and labor, and it also affected this year's wheat harvest.
    In construction of houses, storage of gasoline, digging rivers and other work, because the leadership lacked planning or because they did not consult with the workers and did not accept the workers' opinions, it also caused a lot of losses.
    2. The administrative leadership did not care about the welfare of the workers. The cultural and educational funds of the trade union were not paid on time, and the worker unemployment relief funds were deducted and stored from September 1950, but had not been sent to the relevant departments for relief purposes.
    3. The administration and the trade union were opposed to each other, and they attacked the activists of the trade union. Last July, Comrade Zhu Jixiang, a trade union cadre from Bo'ai County, came to the farm to discuss cultural and educational expenses, labor insurance funds and other issues. Liang Baike (the party branch secretary), the farm secretary, shirked responsibility by saying, "You don't have a letter of introduction, so I can't talk to you," (actually they knew each other). He also said, "It is wrong for the trade union to focus on welfare and not production" (actually the trade union did not give up leading production). Last December, Liang Baike, the farm secretary, used the name of the farm's party branch to request the Bo'ai County Committee to replace Wang Qicai, the director of the farm's trade union, but the county committee did not agree.
    After this rectification campaign, these shortcomings have been examined. The administration has also made a work summary for the year. The trade union has also automatically carried out rectification, examining the spontaneous phenomena in its work. After the rectification, these obstacles in the work were eliminated, which laid a favorable foundation for the great production in 1951.

            Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau Indiscriminately Issued Bonuses
    The Tianjin Railway Administration promulgated the Locomotive Boiler Washing and Inspection Reward Method on September 1st last year, with the purpose of encouraging workers to thoroughly remove boiler scale, so as to save machine coal and extend boiler life. However, due to the impracticality of the reward method and deviations in implementation, incidents of falsely reporting results, fraudulently claiming bonuses, and damaging boiler life have occurred. The story is as follows: After the Administration's reward method was promulgated, the leading cadres of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, in order to strive to obtain bonuses, convened workshops by various levels of workshop directors and veteran workers to discuss and study this reward method. The reward standard stipulates that the average thickness of the boiler scale should be less than 0.5 mm, and the heat transfer area should account for more than 80% to be qualified. In reality, only parts such as the boiler top plate, side plate, and water distribution plate where people can enter have the possibility to achieve what is required in the reward standard; while the boiler's small flue tubes, because of their small area, cannot be entered by people, and the scale in this part cannot be removed at all. Therefore, the locomotive depot reported to the higher level that the reward conditions were set too high and were actually impossible to achieve, and requested the Administration to reconsider. Soon, they received a reply from the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau's Machinery Department, saying that "the Administration is re-studying this issue, and we will notify you of the results." However, there has been no further news since then. Later, it was heard that the Datong and Guisui locomotive depots within the jurisdiction of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau had already reported and claimed this bonus and had been approved. The boiler washing workers of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot were very unconvinced about this and often grumbled. Because in the past, when a locomotive from Guisui was washed and inspected at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, as much as 90 kilograms of scale were removed, and they had also received this bonus. Based on this situation, the leadership of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot also made a tentative request to the sub-bureau's Machinery Department to apply for this bonus. The people in the Machinery Department replied: "As long as the person in charge of the depot stamps it, we will approve it." As a result, the bonus for boiler washing and inspection for last November was received in this way. In December, the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot realized that it was wrong to falsely report results and receive bonuses and did not plan to receive it again. However, the Machinery Department of the sub-bureau believed that it was impossible not to continue receiving it, and if they did not receive it, they would have to return the bonus from November as well. Thus, under the instigation of the Machinery Department of the sub-bureau, the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot applied for the bonus for December again.
    According to our understanding, some locomotive depots, in order to strive for the bonus, do not use manual labor as required to remove boiler scale, but instead use caustic soda to wash it. Therefore, the small flue tubes of locomotive boilers are easily corroded where caustic soda is sprinkled, which greatly damages the boiler's life. This completely violates the original purpose of the Administration's promulgation of the boiler washing and inspection reward method. What is strange is that the sub-bureau does not conduct inspections on the actual condition of the boiler when issuing the bonuses, and just issues the bonuses in a muddled manner.
                                                  Reader  Lan Ying
    Editor's Note: Comrade Lan Ying's letter reflects that some leading cadres in the railway department still seriously exhibit a bureaucratic work style of not inspecting, not reviewing, not studying the opinions of the masses, and just routinely stamping and handling matters. If this bad work style is not corrected one day, many rules and regulations that are originally perfect and feasible will not be able to play their due role; and some systems and regulations that are impractical and have shortcomings will not be able to be revised in a timely manner. According to Comrade Lan Ying's letter, some parts of the method for rewarding the removal of boiler scale stipulated by the Tianjin Railway Administration have excessively high requirements. It was correct for the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot to raise this issue to the leadership at the beginning; however, they failed to adhere to principles afterwards. In particular, the Machinery Department of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, which did not solve the problems raised by the lower levels, knowingly issued the bonuses in a perfunctory manner, even though it knew that there were problems with this reward. Such rewards not only cannot play a good role in promoting production, but instead play a bad role in affecting production. It is hoped that the Tianjin Railway Administration will pay close attention to this issue and conduct a serious inspection of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau's incident of indiscriminately issuing boiler washing and inspection bonuses.

            博爱机耕农场检查了官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：
    国营博爱机耕农场在这次整风中检查出该场领导上存在着官僚主义作风，其主要表现在以下几方面：
    一、行政领导方面，在生产工作上不虚心接受工人的合理化建议。去年秋收时，农场的豆子尚未完全成熟，但种麦的任务已经到来，故决定提早收割豆类。与此同时，五千多亩的棉田也大部成熟了，工人们提议将人力分成两部分使用，以便收豆摘花同时进行。行政领导方面不采纳工人意见，组织全部人力收割豆类。结果，一部分已经成熟应采摘的棉花被雨打落地下，受了很大损失。
    种玉茭的季节已过，行政方面不听工人的意见，种上四百多亩地的玉茭，结果只长得二尺多长，玉茭的收获，还不够汽油和人工的消耗，而且还影响了今年麦子的收成。
    在建筑房屋、保管汽油、挖河等工作上，因为领导上缺乏计划或因不和工人商量，不接受工人的意见，也造成了不少的损失。
    二、行政领导方面对工人福利不关心，工会的文化教育费，没有按时支付，工人失业救济金从一九五○年九月份开始扣存，但一直没有送到有关部门去用于救济。
    三、行政与工会对立，并且打击工会的积极分子。去年七月间，博爱县工会干部朱吉祥同志到农场来谈文教费、劳保金等问题，农场秘书梁百克（党支书）推诿说，你没有介绍信，我和你说不着话（实际上并非不认识），并说，工会搞福利不搞生产是错误的（实际上工会并未放弃领导生产）。去年十二月该农场秘书梁百克假借农场党支部名义，向博爱县委要求撤换农场工会主任王起才，县委没有同意。
    经过此次整风，这些缺点已检查出来，行政上并且作出了一年的工作总结。工会方面，也自动进行了整顿，检查出工作上的自流现象。整风后扫除了这些工作中的障碍，这才为一九五一年的大生产打下了有利的基础。

            张家口铁路分局滥发奖金
    天津铁路管理局去年九月一日颁布了机车锅炉洗检奖励办法，目的在鼓励工友彻底清除锅炉水锈，以节省机煤并延长锅炉寿命。但由于奖励办法不切合实际，执行上有偏差，竟发生虚报成绩、冒领奖金及损害锅炉寿命事情。事情经过是这样：自管理局奖励办法颁布后，张家口机务段领导干部，为了争取获得奖金，即召集各级工长及老工人对这一奖励办法进行讨论研究。奖励标准中规定是锅炉水锈平均厚度在零点五公厘以下，传热面积占百分之八十以上者为合格。而实际上只有锅炉顶钣、侧钣和分水钣等部分能钻进人的地方，才有可能做到像奖励标准中所要求那样；而锅炉的大小烟管部因为面积小，人钻不进去，这一部分的水锈根本打不了。因此机务段就向上级反映这一奖励条件订得太高，实际上不可能作到，要求管理局重新考虑。不久接到张家口铁路分局机务科的答复，说是“管理局正在重新研究这个问题，有结果再通知。”但此后一直就没有下文。后来听说张家口铁路分局管内的大同和归绥两个机务段均已报领此项奖励，并且得到批准。张家口机务段的洗炉工友对此非常不服气，经常嘀咕。因为过去归绥有一台机车在张家口机务段作洗检时，曾打出达九十公斤之多的水锈，而他们也竟领到了此项奖金。根据这一情况，张家口机务段领导上也就向分局机务科作试探性地要求请领此项奖金。机务科的人回答说：“只要段上请领的主管盖章，我们就批准。”于是张家口机务段也就写了一份“锅炉合乎标准”的鉴定，结果去年十一月份的锅炉洗检的奖励就这样领到了。至十二月份，张家口机务段认识到这样虚报成绩领奖是不对的，不打算再领。但分局机务科认为不继续领不行，不领就得连十一月份的奖金都退回。这样，在分局机务科的怂恿下，张家口机务段又请领了十二月份的奖金。
    据我们了解：现在有些机务段为了争取领奖，在清除锅炉水锈时不是按规定用人工打，而是用火碱洗。因此机车锅炉的大小烟管在撒火碱的地方很容易腐蚀，对锅炉寿命损害很大。这样就完全违反了管理局颁布锅炉洗检奖励办法的本来目的。奇怪的是分局在发奖时对锅炉的实际情况竟不进行检查，就这样糊涂的发奖。
                                                  读者  蓝英
    编者按：蓝英同志的来信，反映了铁道部门的某些领导干部，还严重地存在着对工作不检查、不审核、不研究群众意见，照例盖章办事的官僚主义作风。这种恶劣作风一日得不到纠正，许多本来是完善可行的规章和条例，便不可能起到应有的作用；而某些不切合实际、存有缺点的制度和规定，也不可能及时得到修正。根据蓝英同志的来信，天津铁路管理局所规定奖励清除锅炉水锈的办法，其中某些部分是要求过高的。张家口机务段开始向领导上提出了这个问题是正确的；但以后即未能坚持原则。特别是张家口铁路分局机务科，下面提出的问题不解决，明知这样奖励有问题，却依然马虎发了奖金了事。这样的奖励不但不能起推动生产的好作用，反而起影响生产的坏作用。希望天津铁路管理局很好地注意这一问题。并对张家口铁路分局滥发锅炉洗检奖金的事件，认真进行检查。
