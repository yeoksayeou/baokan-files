Editor's Note: Acupuncture therapy, one of the important legacies of Chinese medicine, although it has a long history, has not attracted widespread attention from many medical and health institutions and medical workers, so it has not been systematically studied and promoted scientifically. In order to meet the health needs of the Chinese people and the needs of national construction, we believe that this medical heritage, which has a long history and rich experience and has proven effective in practice, should be earnestly studied and promoted.

Here, we are publishing the article by Comrade Zhu Lian, Deputy Director of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, hoping to provoke discussion. This is the content of the preface and treatment principles of her book "New Acupuncture" (which will soon be published by People's Publishing House). The current title has been added by the editor.

I. The Origin and Current Status of Acupuncture

The ancients often mentioned "needle" and "bian" together, calling them "needle-bian." Using "bian stones" to treat diseases is the origin of acupuncture treatment. "Bian stones" were used to pierce the body with sharp stones, and later gradually developed into needles made of metal such as steel, silver, gold, and tinplate. The needle method originally included three aspects: surgery (such as cutting open pustules to drain pus), bloodletting, and piercing meridians. Moxibustion is the use of fire to warm or burn the skin. There are many methods and fuels, but the main one is to crush old mugwort leaves into cones and burn them on the skin.

It is unclear when this method originated. According to research on ancient medical books, in primitive times, diseases were mainly treated by "shamans" with spells (later known as "Zhuyouke"). At that time, the use of "bian stones" and "poisons" to treat diseases was incidental. Later, this incidental part gradually developed, and the "shaman" could be called a "shaman-doctor." When medical skills further developed, shamans and doctors separated. Later, acupuncture and drug treatment also diverged. However, this separation was not obvious. The oldest medical book in China is called Suwen. In it, acupuncture and drug treatment are combined, and it mainly discusses acupuncture. This book is clearly a collection of experiences from all directions over many years (regarding the sources of bian stones, needles, moxibustion, and drugs, the book says: the treatment method of "bian stones" came from the East; the treatment method of "poisons" came from the West; the moxibustion method came from the North; the needle method came from the South). It has long been said that this book was compiled by people in the Warring States period.

In addition to Suwen, other acupuncture books written throughout the dynasties include Ling Shu Jing (Ling Shu and Suwen are collectively called Nei Jing), Nan Jing, Zi Wu Jing, Jia Yi Jing, Ming Tang Acupuncture Chart, Qian Jin Fang, etc. During the Song Dynasty, Wang Weide also studied acupuncture, cast bronze figures, and drew bronze figure acupuncture charts, dividing them into the five internal organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) and six fu organs (stomach, gallbladder, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, triple energizer), as well as the pericardium. In the Yuan Dynasty, Hu Tai Bi Lie wrote Jin Lan Xun Jing, and supplemented the twelve meridians into fourteen meridians.

The most widely circulated book among the people now is the Acupuncture Dacheng, which was compiled by Yang Jizhou in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. This shows that people throughout history have put a lot of effort into acupuncture treatment and accumulated rich experience.

In feudal society, people were bound by etiquette. Men and women could not touch each other, and there was a great disparity in status. It was inconvenient to undress and perform acupuncture, so in the upper class of feudal society, acupuncture was gradually replaced by decoctions; however, among the working people, it still spread and became an important method of health care for the working people. It is very common for elderly people in rural areas to know how to let blood and know the acupoints for emergency acupuncture. Among Chinese medicine practitioners, there are quite a few who are enthusiastic about acupuncture and have rich experience. Many acupuncture books have also been published in Guangdong, Hangzhou, Shanxi, Hebei, Shanghai, and other places, and some have been translated from Japanese. However, it is most regrettable that most of them still follow tradition, recite Yin-Yang, the Five Elements, and the Fourteen Meridians, and use them to resist scientific medicine, limiting its development.

The French medical community's attention to Chinese acupuncture began in the seventeenth century. For a long time, due to an overemphasis on theory, work could not be promoted. In recent times, it has gradually developed. There is now a "Gold Needle Workers Association" and two "Gold Needle Societies" in Paris. Each society has more than 300 members and meets once a month to exchange experience and knowledge. Some hospitals even have special gold needle outpatient departments, treating up to fifty or sixty people each time.

Japan's acupuncture was introduced from China during the Tang Dynasty. After the development of modern science, they conducted scientific research and整理 on acupuncture and wrote many books. The acupoint anatomy and some theoretical explanations listed in this book are quoted from them.

Now, some medical institutions of the People's Government of the new China and the People's Liberation Army have also adopted acupuncture therapy, and many have achieved results and won the support of the masses.

II. Why We Should Study Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a valuable historical heritage of Chinese medicine. In recent years, we have proven in experiments that acupuncture has its unique advantages:

First, acupuncture has a wide range of treatments. It can definitely have special effects on neuralgia, no matter which part of the body it is in, and it can also treat or cooperate in the treatment of many diseases of men, women, old and young. Even if some diseases require special medicines or surgery to be cured, acupuncture can still be used under a clear diagnosis to increase resistance and promote recovery.

Second, this is the most drug-saving treatment method. A few years ago, when we started experimenting with acupuncture in a hospital and an outpatient department, the general medical staff had resistance in their emotions. Later, because the facts proved that acupuncture treatment was effective, the most trouble-free, and the most capable of saving medicines, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists all had great interest in it. According to the statistics of our hospital and outpatient department in the internal medicine department alone, 65% of the patients recovered after acupuncture treatment. According to the statistics of medicinal materials, in the two and a half years from the spring of 1946 to the autumn of 1948, not only were stimulants and sedatives rarely used, but morphine-type painkillers were almost never used, and even blood-tonifying and strengthening agents were used very little. Because acupuncture can proliferate or appropriately regulate red and white blood cells, promote vigorous lymph flow, stimulate antibacterial phagocytosis, and metabolism, it can replace blood-tonifying and strengthening agents for general chronic diseases and weak constitutions.

When our army liberated Jinan, Shandong, the militia stretcher team of Jinnan District supported the front line. One team of doctors only knew how to use medicine and did not know acupuncture, while the other team of doctors knew both medicine and acupuncture. The team that used both acupuncture and medicine spent more than 130,000 yuan on medicine; the other team spent more than 400,000 yuan on medicine. After the medicine was used up, they also invited acupuncture doctors to help with the treatment. These are all factual proofs.

Third, it is simple to use. Some modern medical tools are difficult to carry, and some can only be fixed in certain places. Even if syringes are easy to carry, they must be carefully carried and disinfected to avoid damage. Taking Chinese medicine as an example, although they are easy to diagnose diseases, prescribing an internal medicine prescription also requires going to a pharmacy to buy medicine and then decocting it. Acupuncture treatment is completely different. You only need to bring a few needles, some alcohol and cotton (ordinary shochu can be used without alcohol, and new disinfected cotton can replace absorbent cotton. Mugwort leaves are easy to find everywhere, and you don't need to use moxibustion), put them in your pocket, and you can take them out to treat diseases anytime, anywhere. It is common to encounter emergency treatment on the road (including in cars and trains) and in theaters.

The countryside especially welcomes acupuncture because it is not only difficult to invite doctors in the countryside, but it is even more difficult to buy medicine. Some villages are dozens of miles away from pharmacies.

Fourth, as long as you pay attention to disinfection and follow the acupuncture procedures described in this book, there is no need to worry about safety.

Fifth, acupuncture can often help with diagnosis. The organization of the human nervous system is very complex, and it is often extremely difficult to diagnose diseases. For example, a female comrade surnamed Xue was always sleepy. After being examined by many doctors, some said it was anemia, some said it was neurasthenia, and some said there was something wrong with the endocrine glands. She had many injections and took a lot of oral medicine, but it was always ineffective, and she could not find the root cause of the disease. Later, after acupuncture treatment, it was found that her left side of the head and the upper and lower limbs on the right side had no response to acupuncture, while the right side of the head and the upper and lower limbs on the left side had a strong reaction. This kind of cross-mutated situation can generally diagnose that the root of the disease is in the left hemisphere of the brain. After continuing acupuncture for two weeks, the head and limbs had a consistent response to acupuncture, and her sleepiness disappeared. In the nervous system, there are more than 400 acupoints that can be punctured. The response is great for healthy nerves, and the response is small for paralyzed or dull nerves. In addition, it is of great help in differential diagnosis for a disease, whether it is a simple nerve relationship or an organic change. For example, acupuncture treatment can only temporarily relieve the pain of acute appendicitis and intestinal obstruction; acupuncture can make patients feel relaxed and happy immediately for stomach neuralgia and temporary intestinal spasm. This proves the value of acupuncture in helping diagnosis.

Because acupuncture has many of the above-mentioned characteristics, it has always been welcomed by the broad working people. At present, we have few medical staff and lack medicines. It is difficult to help the broad masses of people relieve the pain of diseases. In addition to actively promoting epidemic prevention and hygiene, we advocate acupuncture, first of all, hoping to help solve this problem. It is very important to actively train regular doctors now, but this cannot be done in a short time. At present, we should train a large number of medical staff who can carry out epidemic prevention and treat some diseases to serve the people. Acupuncture is generally a symptomatic treatment and does not completely rely on accurate diagnosis. Acupuncture at certain "acupoints" in a certain part of the body can achieve certain results for indications and chronic diseases. Therefore, people with low levels of education can also learn it. As long as they follow the prescribed methods, there is nothing unsafe, and they can be trained in a relatively short period of time. If we can also send a part of doctors who have received formal training to the countryside to be responsible for education, research, and diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases, then we can gradually improve the health and medical work on the basis of popularization. This is suitable for the needs and cultural and economic conditions of the broad working people today.

Secondly, closely related to the above issues is the issue of uniting and transforming Chinese medicine. According to the number of doctors nationwide, there are dozens of times more Chinese medicine practitioners than Western medicine practitioners. According to the population ratio, according to the survey materials of several counties, there is an average of one Chinese medicine practitioner for every 900 people or more. However, due to their insufficient technical skills and spirit of serving the people, coupled with the limitations of the masses' cultural knowledge and economic strength, many people still seek "witch gods," "divine water," and "medicine slips" to cure their diseases when they get sick. This phenomenon forces us to summon the greatest courage to find a way to solve this problem of uniting and transforming Chinese medicine. If we stubbornly cling to old traditional habits and do not unite and transform Chinese medicine, it is equivalent to helping witch gods harm the people.

To unite and transform Chinese medicine, we must understand some of the medical skills of Chinese medicine. If we are completely ignorant of Chinese medicine skills, we will have no way to transform Chinese medicine, and it will be difficult to unite Chinese medicine well. Because transformation does not mean asking Chinese medicine practitioners to abandon everything they originally had and learn a set of Western medicine. Instead, it mainly means selecting its scientific parts and removing its superstitious and unscientific parts. Therefore, only by building on the basis of helping transformation can unity be reliable and meaningful.

Among the medical skills of Chinese medicine, the easiest for our general medical staff, especially rural medical staff, to master is acupuncture. At present, most Chinese medicine practitioners who understand acupuncture perform acupuncture without paying attention to disinfection and sterilization, and many puncture needles through clothes; they do not understand physiological anatomy, and many cannot even find the acupoints accurately, or even do not pay attention to acupoints at all, and puncture and moxibustion randomly; even more so, they first draw charms and chant spells before acupuncture. If these are not transformed, there will be many abuses. However, if they are slightly transformed, the effect will be extremely obvious. Therefore, conducting our help and improvement of Chinese medicine from this aspect can achieve the effect of "getting twice the result with half the effort." In the past, the epidemic prevention teams we sent to the countryside, the team members learned some acupuncture skills and were able to quickly unite with the local Chinese medicine practitioners. The local Chinese medicine practitioners were also quickly willing to accept their help, from learning acupuncture disinfection to learning other scientific principles, understanding the importance of infectious disease prevention, and even willing to participate in epidemic prevention work.

In addition, if we do not study acupuncture, it will be a major loss to scientific medicine. Because the practice of acupuncture to treat diseases is difficult to explain by modern general medical theory, some people therefore think that the role of acupuncture is an absurd thing and refuse to study it. Our understanding is the opposite. We believe that theory should be revised, and even reformed, according to practice. The mechanical nature of modern medical theory has gradually been exposed, and the call for reforming it has long been shouted out by progressive medical practitioners in the Soviet Union. New theories (neuropathology) have been produced and developed. This new theory provides an explanation for the mystery of acupuncture treatment. Conversely, acupuncture can provide a large number of systematic proofs for this new theory. Therefore, the study of acupuncture will have a great impact on the reform of old medical theory. That is to say, the study of acupuncture not only has great practical significance, but also has great theoretical value.

III. Acupuncture Is Not a Panacea

The great efficacy of acupuncture in clinical treatment surpasses drugs in some aspects; it can play a major role in muscle and joint rheumatism, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, and neurasthenia. Especially for neuropathic pain, the speed of its effectiveness is amazing. For other chronic diseases, such as changes in nerve function that have not reached the point where they are difficult to recover, acupuncture can also be effective. However, it can only be used as a complementary treatment for some acute infectious diseases (such as typhoid fever, cholera, pneumonia). Some diseases cannot be solved without surgery (such as transverse presentation, tumors, acute appendicitis). We believe that whether to use acupuncture or moxibustion or medicine or surgery, or a combination of each, should be determined according to the condition. For example, acupuncture is effective for neuropathic pain and infantile epilepsy, so acupuncture should be used; acupuncture may frighten children with chronic diseases, so moxibustion should be used after they fall asleep; sulfonamides and penicillin are rapidly effective for meningitis and pneumonia, so these drugs should be used; acupuncture can immediately stop pain and vomiting when neurotic vomiting occurs in acute gastritis, and taking medicine can help the stomach quickly discharge, so it is better to use acupuncture first and then medicine for combined treatment; difficult labor can immediately be removed by surgery to take out the fetus, under the possible conditions, an obstetrician should be invited immediately or the parturient should be sent to the hospital. In short, whichever treatment method is most effective and can reduce the patient's pain should be used.

However, some people regard acupuncture as a panacea and use it to resist drug treatment and scientific methods, which is wrong.

For example, the "Outline of Acupuncture Medicine" published in Guangdong in 1935 wrote: "Drug treatment aims to kill bacteria, so no matter how peaceful the medicine is, it inevitably has a few points of harm. If the diagnosis is accidentally wrong and the medicine is not right for the disease, the lighter ones have the risk of developing other diseases, and the heavier ones have the worry of life. As for the death caused by dissection and the transformation into neurasthenia patients caused by taking Mongolian medicine, there is no need to say. Acupuncture treatment only uses one needle and one moxa, and there is no danger or worry about future troubles. It can be called the safest treatment method." This statement does not understand drugs, because "drug treatment" is not purely for "bactericidal purposes," and the occurrence of harm is also due to improper use by doctors or carelessness by pharmacists who misdose the dosage. What's more, random acupuncture and moxibustion are not "completely without danger" and "completely without worry about future troubles."

Another example is the "Chinese Acupuncture" published by the Beijing National Medicine Pillar Monthly in 1935, which contains an article entitled "The Beginning and End of Curing Dystocia with Acupuncture at Hegu and Sanyinjiao." The dystocia recorded in his article, according to the symptoms described in the article, is actually a premature rupture of the membranes and dry labor due to amniotic fluid leakage. According to our experience, although general dystocia can be treated with acupuncture to stimulate the contraction of the uterus through nerves, it is very dangerous if real dystocia is not treated with obstetric surgery.

We oppose thinking that acupuncture is an old, rustic thing and looking down on it. On the contrary, we believe that because it has a history, is welcomed by the working people, and is produced by thousands of years of flesh and blood experience, we should study and improve it even more. At the same time, we also oppose blindly worshiping it because it is an ancient thing; using three generations of family tradition as an excuse for boasting, and mystifying acupuncture with "ghost acupoints and divine needles" to resist scientific medicine, which will gradually lead acupuncture to extinction. We must advocate a strong concept of disinfection and oppose carelessness, puncturing needles through clothes. Although acupuncture is generally a symptomatic treatment and can treat some diseases without an accurate diagnosis, it does not mean that we should treat confused diseases; on the contrary, we must have a research spirit and must pay attention to diagnosis, or ask the hospital to help diagnose and guide the treatment. We must welcome the cooperation of science and technology. If a disease cannot be cured, we must send it to the hospital under possible conditions, because acupuncture is not a panacea.

　　针灸疗法的重要性及其原理
　　朱琏
    编者按：我国医学重要的遗产之一——针灸疗法，虽然有了很长久的历史，但是，并没有引起许多医疗卫生机关和医务工作者普遍的重视，以致还没有被系统地加以科学的研究与推广。为了适应我国人民群众健康和国家建设工作的需要，我们认为对于这种具有悠久历史和丰富经验，在实践中证明确有成效的医学遗产，亟应切实注意加以研究和推广。
    在这里，我们将中央人民政府卫生部妇幼卫生局副局长朱琏同志的文章发表出来，希望引起讨论。这是她所著的《新针灸学》一书（该书即将由人民出版社印行）的绪言和治疗原理两篇的内容。现在的标题是编者加的。
            一  针灸的由来与现状
    古人常把“针”和“砭”并提，说成“针砭”。用“砭石”治病，就是针灸治病的起源。“砭石”是用石头尖在身上扎，以后逐步发展到以钢、银、金、马口铁等金属制成针。针法里面，原先也包括外科手术（如切开脓疱放脓）、放血、刺经络等三方面。灸是用火来温热或烧灼皮肤，方法与燃料也有很多种，但主要的是用陈旧的艾叶捣碎捻成炷，放在皮肤上燃着。
    这种方法到底产生在那一年代，说不清。根据古医学书来研究，原始时代主要是由“神巫”以符咒治病（即后来所谓“祝由科”）。在当时，用“砭石”、“毒药”来治病是附带的。后来，这附带的部分渐渐发展，“神巫”就称得上“巫医”了。等到医术更进一步发展，巫、医才分了家。再以后，针灸和药物治疗又发生分化。不过这回分家是不明显的。我国最古的一部医书叫素问，那里面，针灸和药物的治疗还合在一起，并且主要是讲的针灸。这本书很明显的是多少年代集中了四面八方的经验而成的（关于砭石、针、灸、药物的来源，那书里说到：“砭石”的治法是从东方传来的；“毒药”的治法是从西方传来的；灸法是从北方传来的；针法是从南方传来的）。在老早就有人说，这书是战国时代的人编辑的。
    历代所著的针灸书籍，除素问以外，还有灵枢经（灵枢、素问合称内经）、难经、子午经、甲乙经、明堂针灸图、千金方等等。宋朝王维德还考次针灸，铸铜人，画了铜人针灸图，分脏腑十二经（五脏：心、肝、脾、肺、肾。六腑：胃、胆、大肠、小肠、膀胱、三焦，还有心包络）。元朝的忽泰必列著金兰循经，又将十二经补充成十四经。
    现在流传民间最广的，要算是针灸大成一书，这是明末清初时杨继洲编著的。这说明历来的人对针灸治疗，曾经煞费苦心，积累了丰富的经验。
    在封建社会中，人们受礼教的束缚，男女授受不亲，尊卑身份悬殊，不便于脱衣解带施行针灸，所以在封建的上层社会里，针灸便逐渐为汤药所代替；可是在劳动人民中间，它仍然传布着，成了劳动人民保健的重要方法。现在农村里的年老者，知道放血，知道针灸急救穴位的，很是普遍。在中医里面热心针灸，且富有经验者，颇不乏人。在广东、杭州、山西、河北、上海等地也出版过许多针灸书籍，也有翻译日本文的。然而最可惋惜的，其中大多数还是因袭传统，背诵阴阳五行与十四经，且拿来抵挡科学的医学，限制了它的发展。
    法国医界对中国针灸术的注意，是在十七世纪。很长时间因偏重理论，不能推动工作。近代已逐渐发展，巴黎现在就有一个“金针工作者协会”，有两个“金针学会”，每个学会都有会员三百多人，每月开会一次，交换经验和知识。有些地方的医院里还专设金针门诊部，每次治疗可达五六十人。
    日本的针灸术是我国唐朝时传去的。他们在近代科学发展以后，对针灸便作了一番科学的研究和整理，著述很多。本书里面列举的穴位解剖，和部分的理论解释，是引用他们的。
    现在新中国的人民政府与人民解放军的医务机关中，好些也采用了针灸疗法，有很多已经取得成效，得到了群众的拥护。
            二  我们为什么要研究针灸
    针灸术是中国医学上宝贵的历史遗产。近几年来我们在实验中证明，针灸有它独特的长处：
    第一、针灸治疗的范围很广，它对于神经痛，不论在身体的那一部分，固然可以肯定有特效，而男女老幼的许多种疾病，它也大都可以治疗，或配合治疗。即使有些病需用特效药品或行外科手术才能根治，但在明确诊断之下，施用针灸，也可以起增加抵抗力与促进恢复的作用。
    第二、这是最节省药品的治疗方法。数年前，我们开始在一个医院和一个门诊部实验针灸时，一般医务人员在情绪上曾发生抵抗，后来因为事实证明针灸治疗有效，并且最省事又最能节省药品，所以不论是医生、护士、司药对它就都有了极大的兴趣。我们那个医院与门诊部仅内科方面的统计，经针灸治疗病愈的占百分之六十五强。药材方面统计，从一九四六年春到一九四八年秋的两年半中，不仅兴奋剂、镇静药剂类很少用，吗啡一类的止痛剂几乎没有用过，就是补血强壮药剂也用得极少。因为针灸术能使赤白血球增殖或适当的调剂，促进淋巴液旺盛，激起抗菌食菌与新陈代谢等作用，所以对于一般慢性病和体质弱的，大都可以针灸代替补血强壮药了。
    当我军解放山东济南时，冀南区民兵担架队支援前线，其中有一队的医生只懂用药不会针灸，有一队的医生，懂药治也会针灸。兼用针灸治疗的那一队，花药费十三万元多；另一队，则花药费四十多万元，药用完了，还请了针灸医生去帮助治疗。这些都是事实的证明。
    第三、使用简便。近代的医疗工具，有的携带困难，有的甚至只能固定在一定的场合，即使注射器易带，而在携带和消毒时，也得细心注意，不使损坏。就拿用药的中医来说，他们诊病虽然简便，但是，开个内服药单，也需要去药铺买药，而后煎服。针灸治疗就完全不同，只需带几根针，带些酒精和棉花（没有酒精用普通烧酒，消毒过的新棉花也可代替脱脂棉。艾叶到处容易找到，不用艾灸也可以），放在衣袋里，随时随地就能取出治病。在路上（包括在汽车、火车上）、在戏院里，救治急症的事，常常遇到。
    农村尤其欢迎针灸，因为农村不仅请医生困难，买药更困难，有的村庄离药铺有几十里路远。
    第四、只要注意消毒，按本书所讲的针灸法施行，没有不安全的顾虑。
    第五、针刺也往往能帮助诊断。人体神经的组织机构很复杂，发生疾病，往往极难诊断。例如：一位姓薛的女同志，一天尽想瞌睡，经过很多的医生检查，有的说是贫血，有的说是神经衰弱；有的说是内分泌腺有毛病；注射过很多针药，内服药也用了不少，始终不见效，也找不出病根。以后经针刺试治，一星期的时间，发现她的左偏头部和右边上下肢，对针刺没有感应，右偏头部和左边的上下肢，就有较强的反应。这种交叉变态的情形，一般的可诊断病根在大脑的左半边，以后继续针了两星期，头部和肢体对针刺有了一致的感应，她的瞌睡病也就消失了。在神经系统，可以针的穴位，有四百多处，神经健康的，反应就大，麻痹或迟钝的，则反应就很小。此外，对于一种病，是单纯的神经关系还是器质变化，在鉴别诊断上也有很大帮助。例如：急性阑尾炎、肠闭塞等病的疼痛与呕吐，针治只能临时减轻痛苦；胃神经痛和一时性的肠痉挛，针后可使病人立显轻松愉快。这都是证明它帮助诊断的价值。
    针灸因为具有上述许多特长，所以历来被广大的劳动人民所欢迎。目前我们医务干部少，药品缺乏，很难帮助广大群众解除疾病痛苦，除掉积极推动防疫卫生之外，我们提倡针灸，首先就是希望帮助解决这个问题。现在积极培养正规医生，很是重要，但这不是短时间所能办得到的。在目前应该大量培养一批能进行防疫又能治一些病的医务人员，去为人民服务。针灸术一般是对症疗法，并不完全依赖精确诊断，身体上大致某部分的病，针灸某些“穴”位，对于适应症与慢性病，就能收到一定的效果。所以，文化程度低的人也可以学，只要按照规定的办法施行，没有什么不安全，而且在比较短的时期内就能训练出来。我们如果能同时派遣一部分受过正规训练的医生下乡，担负教育、研究和诊治复杂病症的工作，这样，就能使卫生医疗工作，在普及基础上逐步提高，这是适合今天广大劳动人民的需要与文化经济的条件的。
    其次，与以上问题息息相关的，就是团结与改造中医的问题。全国的医生，按数量比较起来，中医比西医多几十倍。按人口比例，根据几个县的调查材料来说，平均约九百人以上有一个中医。但是由于他们的技术和为人民服务的精神还不够高，再加上群众文化知识与经济力量的限制，群众有了病，仍有许多求“巫神”“神水”“药签”来治的。这种现象，逼着我们拿出最大的勇气，来想法解决这个对中医团结与改造的问题。我们如果固执旧的传统习惯，不去团结改造中医，这就等于帮助巫神来危害人民。
    要想团结与改造中医，我们就不能不懂一些中医的医术。我们若是对中医医术完全外行，对中医的改造固然无从下手，对中医的团结也很难做好。因为改造不是叫中医去掉原有的一切，另学一套西医，而主要是选择它科学的部分，去掉它迷信不科学的部分，因此只有建筑在帮助改造的基础上，团结才可靠也才有意义。
    中医医术里面最便于我们一般医务人员，尤其是农村医务人员掌握的，就是针灸。现在一般懂得针灸的中医，施行针灸而不讲究消毒杀菌，很多隔着衣服扎针；不明白生理解剖，很多连穴位也摸不准，甚至根本不注意穴位，乱针乱灸；更有先画符念咒而后针灸。这些如果不加改造，流弊甚多。但是稍加改造，则收效极为明显。所以我们从这方面进行对中医的帮助与提高，最能收“事半功倍”之效。我们过去派到乡村去的防疫队，队员们稍稍学了一些针灸术，就能很快和当地中医团结在一起，当地的中医也很快的愿意接受他们的帮助，由学针灸消毒，进而学习其他科学道理，理解传染病预防的重要，直至愿意参加防疫工作。
    此外，我们如果不研究针灸，对于科学的医学，也将是一个重大损失。因为针灸治病的实际，是现代一般医学理论所难以解释的，有些人就因此认为针灸的作用是荒诞的事，拒绝加以研究。我们的认识则相反，我们认为理论是应该按照实际来加以修正，甚至改革的。现代医学理论的机械性，已经逐渐暴露，对它发起改革的呼声，早就由苏联进步的医学者喊出。新的理论（神经病理学），已经产生、发展。这个新的理论，对于针灸治病的神秘，提供了解释。反过来针灸又能够为这个新的理论，提供大量的有系统的证明材料。因此研究针灸学，对于旧医学理论的改革将发生极大的作用。这就是说，研究针灸，不仅是有它极大的现实意义，而且可以有极大的理论价值。
            三  针灸不是万能
    针灸在临床治疗上的伟大效力，在某些方面胜过药物；对肌肉与关节风湿症、慢性胃肠病、神经衰弱等疾病，它可以起主治作用。尤以对神经性疼痛，其见效之速，是令人惊奇的。其他慢性病，如神经机能的变化，没有到难以恢复的程度，针灸也能收效。但对一些急性传染病（如伤寒、霍乱、肺炎），只能作为配合治疗。有些病则非施行手术不能解决（如横产、肿瘤、急性阑尾炎）。我们认为，或针或灸或用药或施行手术，或相互配合，应该按病情决定。例如神经性疼痛与小儿急痫，针刺有效，就应该用针刺；小儿慢性病，针刺会使小儿惊惧，就应在睡后用艾灸；脑膜炎、肺炎用磺胺、潘尼西林（青霉素）效力迅速，那就应该采用这些药物；急性胃炎发生神经性呕吐，完全不能饮食时，针灸可立刻停痛止吐，服药又可帮助胃内迅速排除，则不妨先用针灸后服药配合医治；难产可立刻用手术取出胎儿，在可能的条件下，就应立刻请产科医生或将产妇送入医院。总之，那一种治疗法最有效，病人的痛苦可以减轻，那末就应该用那一种。
    可是，有人以针灸为万能，用来抗击药治与科学方法，这是不对的。
    例如：一九三五年广东出版的《针灸医学大纲》上面写道：“药物治疗以杀菌为目的，故无论如何和平之剂，不免有几分毒害，诊断偶误，下不对症，轻者有并发他病之虞，重者且有生命之忧。至于剖割以致毙命，及下蒙药后以致变为神经衰弱患者无论矣。针灸治疗只用一针一艾，全无危险发生，全无后患之虑，堪称为最安全的治疗法”。这种说法，是不了解药物，因为“药物治疗”既不是纯为“杀菌目的”，而发生危害，也是医生用之不当，或司药不慎，配错剂量。更何况，乱针乱灸，也并非“全无危险发生”“全无后患之虑”。
    又如：一九三五年北京国医砥柱月刊社出版的《中国针灸学》，其中有一篇文章，题目是《针合谷三阴交治愈难产始末记》，所载的难产照他文章中叙述的症候看来，实际是胎膜破裂过早，羊水流干的滞产。据我们的经验，一般的滞产，虽可用针刺法来通过神经激动子宫的收缩力，但真正的难产如不使用产科手术，那是很危险的。
    我们反对以为针灸是古老的、土里土气的东西，就瞧他不起。相反的，我们认为正是因为它是有历史的，为劳动人民所欢迎的，是几千年来血肉的经验所产生的，就更要研究与提高它。同时，我们也反对因为它是古老的东西，就盲目的崇拜它；以三辈祖传为夸耀的借口，以“鬼穴神针”将针灸神秘化，来抵抗科学的医学，这将会使针灸逐渐沦于澌灭。我们要提倡强烈的消毒观念，反对马马虎虎，隔着衣服就扎针。针灸虽说一般是对症治疗，没有精确的诊断也能治一些病，但是并不是说我们就应该治糊涂病；相反的，我们要有研究精神，一定要讲究诊断，或是请医院帮助诊断，指导治疗。我们要欢迎科学技术的配合，不能治的病，在可能条件下，要送进医院，因为针灸并不是万能的。
