Answering Readers' Questions on Several Issues in Party Building Work

I. How to Handle a Party Member Concealing Their Historical Problems from the Party? Comrade Xia Hong:

It is wrong for a party member to conceal their history from the Party. This act of concealing one's history from the Party indicates that the party member's class consciousness is not yet high, and they are not loyal and honest to the Party, but rather hold an attitude of concealment and deception. The Party must criticize or punish them according to the Party Constitution. However, Party committees at all levels must conduct specific analysis and handle the matter separately when dealing with this issue. For example: what problem was concealed—obviously, concealing a political problem needs to be handled differently from concealing a lifestyle problem; under what circumstances was it concealed; how long was it concealed; did they report it to the Party themselves, or were they exposed by someone else; what was their attitude after being exposed? Only after Party committees at all levels have clarified these situations can they correctly handle these problems. Regarding the issue of a certain probationary party member concealing their history, because the letter did not clearly explain their situation, a specific reply cannot yet be given.

Regarding whether extending the probationary period counts as a Party disciplinary action, this was already answered in "Several Questions Regarding Disciplinary Actions for Individual Party Members" on January 10th. Extending the probationary period is not a form of punishment.

II. Can "Expulsion from the Party of a Probationary Party Member" be Changed to "Suspension of the Probationary Party Member's Life"? Comrade Wang Fuyi:

You ask whether "Expulsion from the Party of a Probationary Party Member" can be changed to "Suspension of the Probationary Party Member's Life," and your reason is: "The probationary party member does not count their time in the probationary period as party membership… therefore, they cannot be considered to have party membership." This statement is inappropriate. Although probationary personnel are not formal party members, they are already a part of the Party, and therefore already have party membership; on the other hand, precisely because probationary party members must still undergo the Party's observation and education before they can become formal party members; and it is possible that after observation, it is discovered that this probationary party member does not yet possess the basic requirements of a party member and their qualification as a probationary party member is revoked. Therefore, when calculating party membership time, it should not start from the date of joining the Party, but from the date of becoming a full member.

"Expulsion from the Party of a Probationary Party Member" and "Suspension of the Probationary Party Member's Life" both essentially make a probationary party member who does not yet possess the basic requirements of a party member leave the Party, so there is no need to distinguish between them.

III. Is it Necessary for a New Party Member to be Approved by a General Branch Meeting? Comrade Ke Fei:

The two questions you asked in your letter are briefly answered below:

First, according to the Party Constitution, new party members must have two formal party members as introducers, be discussed and approved by the branch general meeting, and approved by the higher-level Party committee. Although in special circumstances, the county party committee or a party committee equivalent to the county party committee can directly decide to accept individuals. However, it is incorrect to adopt individual acceptance methods when it is possible to absorb party members through discussion and approval by the branch general meeting, due to other reasons, such as fearing that everyone does not understand this comrade and cannot pass it at the branch general meeting, etc. The correct method should be to introduce the situation of this comrade in detail for everyone to discuss.

Second, the filling of vacancies on the branch committee is stipulated in Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Party Constitution: the party's leadership organs at all levels are generated by elections. Therefore, when there is a vacancy on the branch committee, it can be filled by a probationary branch committee member. If there is no probationary branch committee member, the branch general meeting can elect a new branch committee member. If due to environmental or conditional limitations, a representative meeting can also be convened for election, or the higher-level party committee can designate it.

If your branch generally adopts the method of individual acceptance to absorb new party members without going through the branch general meeting discussion and approval; or designates new branch committee members by the branch without going through the branch general meeting election, this is obviously inappropriate. You can formally raise your opinions and criticisms to the branch. The branch also has the obligation to consider and accept your opinions and criticisms.

### 关于建党工作中几个问题答读者问

　　关于建党工作中几个问题答读者问
  一、如何处理党员对党隐瞒自己的历史问题？夏虹同志：
    党员对党隐瞒自己的历史是错误的。这种对党隐瞒自己历史的事实，说明了这个党员的阶级觉悟还不高，对党不是忠诚老实，而是抱着隐瞒欺骗的态度，党必须按照党章给予批评或处分。但是各级党委在处理这一问题时，却必须进行具体分析，分别处理；例如：隐瞒了什么问题——很显然隐瞒一个政治问题与隐瞒一个生活问题，是需要分别处理的，在什么情况下隐瞒的，隐瞒的时间多长，是自己向党报告的，还是被人揭发的，被揭发后的态度怎样。各级党委只有把这些情况弄得清清楚楚之后，才能正确的处理这些问题。关于某候补党员隐瞒历史的问题，因为来信没有把他的情况交代得很清楚，所以还不能作具体答复。
    关于延长候补期是否算党内处分问题，这在一月十日“关于党员个人处分的几个问题”中已有答复，延长候补期并不是一种处分。
          ——编者
  二、可不可以把“开除候补党员党籍”改为“停止候补党员生活
        ”？王扶义同志：
    你问是不是可以把“开除候补党员党籍”改为“停止候补党员生活”，你的理由是：“候补党员在候补期中不算党龄……所以也不能算党籍。”这种说法是不妥当的。候补人员虽然不是正式党员，但已是党内的一分子，因此已具有党籍；另一方面正因为候补党员还须经过党的考察和教育，方可成为正式党员；并有可能经过考察后，发现这个候补党员还没有具备一个党员的起码条件而取消其候补党员资格。因此计算党龄时就不应当从入党日起，而应从转正日起。
    “开除候补党员党籍”和“停止候补党员生活”，实质上都是使一个还没有具备党员起码条件的候补党员出党，因此没有加以区别的必要。
          编者
  三、新党员入党是不是必须经过支部大会讨论通过？克非同志：
    你来信所问的两个问题，简答如下：
    第一，新党员入党，按照党章规定：必须有正式党员二人介绍，经过支部大会讨论通过，和上级党委批准。虽然在特殊情形下，也可以经过县委以上之党委及相当县委之党委，直接决定个别地接收。但是不能在可以经过支部大会讨论通过吸收党员时，却因为有其他原因，例如恐怕大家对这一同志不了解，在支部大会通不过等，因而采用个别接收方式，这是不对的。正确的办法，应当是详细地介绍这一同志的情况，由大家讨论。
    第二，递补支委，按党章第十四条第一款规定：党的各级领导机关由选举制产生，因而在支委出缺时，可以由候补支委递补。如无候补支委者，可由支部大会补选新支委。如由于环境或条件的限制，也可以召集代表会选举，或由上级党委指定。
    你们支部如果在一般情况下，不经过支部大会讨论通过，而采取个别接收的方式吸收新党员；不经过支部大会选举，即由支部指定新支委，这显然是不妥当的。你可以向支部正式提出自己的意见和批评。支部也有义务来考虑与接受你这种意见与批评。
