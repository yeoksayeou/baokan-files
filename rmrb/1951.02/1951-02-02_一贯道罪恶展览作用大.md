    The Exhibition of I-Kuan Tao's Crimes Has a Great Effect
    To the Editor:
    On January 26th, I went to Zhongshan Park to visit the "Exhibition of I-Kuan Tao's Crimes." This exhibition made me clearly understand the crimes of I-Kuan Tao. In the exhibition, former I-Kuan Tao altar masters, initiators, and "three talents" who had awakened, used the method of first performing and then accusing, to specifically and vividly explain to the visitors that "I-Kuan Tao" is a reactionary organization that colludes with imperialism and Kuomintang secret agents to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Many visitors felt that this form of propaganda and education was very good. Some said: "In the past, I only knew that 'I-Kuan Tao' was bad, but today I have a concrete understanding of the crimes of this reactionary Taoist sect." Some said: "Great, in the future, when publicizing the crimes of I-Kuan Tao to the masses, we will have concrete materials!" I also have the following two suggestions for relevant authorities to consider:
    (1) The propaganda and education method of having awakened I-Kuan Tao altar masters, initiators, and "three talents" perform first and then accuse has a great effect. It is hoped that it can be promoted to every city and rural area with I-Kuan Tao activities, so that everyone can recognize what I-Kuan Tao is.
    (2) It is hoped that the Beijing I-Kuan Tao crime exhibition will set a certain time for everyone to enter Zhongshan Park without tickets, so that more people can have the opportunity to visit.

### 一贯道罪恶展览作用大

    一贯道罪恶展览作用大编辑同志：
    一月二十六日，我到中山公园去参观了“一贯道罪恶展览会”。这次展览，使我清楚地认识了一贯道的罪恶。而展览会中，由已觉悟了的前一贯道坛主、点传师及三才等，用先表演后控诉的方式，具体而形象地向参观者说明了“一贯道”是一个与帝国主义及国民党特务勾结而进行反革命活动的反动组织，使很多参观者对这种宣传教育的方式，都感觉很好。有的说：“过去我光知道‘一贯道’不好，今天可叫我具体认识了这个反动道门的罪恶。”有的说：“好啦，以后再向群众宣传一贯道的罪恶时，可有具体材料啦！”我并有以下两点建议，供有关机关参考：
    （一）由已觉悟了的一贯道坛主、点传师和三才等先表演后控诉的宣传教育方式，其效果是很大的。希望能够把它推广到每一个有一贯道活动的城市和农村中去。使每一个人都认清一贯道是什么东西。
    （二）北京这次一贯道罪恶展览会，希望能规定一定时间让大家免票入中山公园，以使更多的人能够得到参观的机会。
