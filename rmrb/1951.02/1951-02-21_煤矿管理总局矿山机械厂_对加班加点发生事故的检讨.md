To the Editor:

After the publication of Comrade Zhang Yi's criticism of our plant in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on January 11th, we immediately conducted an inspection and offer the following self-criticism:

(1) At the end of last year, our plant did indeed use overtime work to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities. We now realize that using overtime to complete tasks is improper and detrimental to workers' health. This year, we have decided to gradually bring production back on track and strive to avoid the phenomenon of rushing work with overtime.

(2) When manufacturing the chain plates for the chain-type coal conveyor, due to the poor equipment in our plant, the initial manual cutting was time-consuming. In order to meet the task requirements, we risked using the plant's only press. Due to the lack of proper inspection of the press, the machine malfunctioned on November 26th. The inspection revealed that the cause of the damage was: (1) The main lead screw of the press had been worn for too long, and the thread pitch in the middle section differed from the upper and lower sections by about one point [approximately 1/8 of an inch], resulting in an imbalance of load-bearing force. (2) The machine itself had exceeded its service life, and it was being used beyond its capacity. Therefore, after the accident occurred, we always believed that "the damage was a normal phenomenon." Only after Comrade Zhang Yi's criticism and the inspection by the Party, government, and labor union, did we realize that if we had carried out a good repair before use and replaced the main lead screw, the damage accident would not have occurred. We did not pay attention to inspection and repair beforehand, and we did not conduct a good self-criticism afterward, completely emphasizing objective reasons. This is bureaucracy at work.

Having learned the above lessons, we plan to strengthen the following work this year:

1. Strengthen organizational planning. Formulate appropriate production plans based on the factory's equipment strength. 2. Encourage employees to use their brains, carry out rationalization proposals, and improve production technology and labor organization to reduce costs. 3. Regularly inspect and repair machines, and strengthen employee safety education.

### 煤矿管理总局矿山机械厂  对加班加点发生事故的检讨

　　煤矿管理总局矿山机械厂
    对加班加点发生事故的检讨
    编辑同志：
    贵报一月十一日《读者来信》栏发表了张毅同志对本厂的批评以后，我们即进行检查，并作如下检讨：
    （一）去年年底，本厂确曾用加班加点的方式来完成上级所付给的任务。现在我们认识到用加班方式来完成任务是不正当的，是损害工人健康的。今年我们决定要使生产逐渐走向正轨，极力避免加班赶活的现象。
    （二）制造锁链运煤机的链子板时，因本厂设备不善，初做时用人力裁制，很费时。为了赶任务，就冒险地用本厂唯一的压力机压制。对压力机缺乏应有的检查，结果该机于十一月二十六日发生故障。检查损坏原因是：（１）压力机的主力丝杠磨擦过久，中段丝扣与上下段的丝扣约差一分左右，因而负担力量不平衡。（２）机器本身已超过使用年限，使用时又超过负荷。所以事故发生后，我们一直认为“损坏乃系正常现象”，经张毅同志批评和党、政、工三方面的检查，才认识到：如果在使用之前，加以很好修理，换主力丝杠，就不至发生损坏事故。事前未曾注意检修，事后又未很好检讨，完全强调客观理由，这是官僚主义在作祟。
    接受以上教训，我们拟于今年加强如下工作：
    １、加强组织计划性。根据工厂设备力量，拟定适当生产计划。２、启发职工开动脑筋，开展合理化建议，改进生产技术和劳动组织，以减低成本。３、定期检修机器，并加强职工保安教育。
