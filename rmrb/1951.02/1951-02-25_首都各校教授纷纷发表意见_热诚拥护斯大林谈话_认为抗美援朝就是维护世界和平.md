　　【Report from this newspaper】Professors from various universities in the capital have successively published written opinions, expressing their enthusiastic support for Marshal Stalin's speech on the international situation.

　　Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University Council, believes: Marshal Stalin's speech affirmed the inevitable victory of justice. After reading his speech, the historical significance of resisting America and aiding Korea became even clearer, and we should strengthen our efforts to defend peace in many ways. Yang Hui, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs and Director of the Chinese Department of the university, said: "Marshal Stalin pointed out the way for peace-loving people to stop wars, making us clearly realize that the forces of peace are powerful, and even more clearly recognize that the path we are taking is the path to maintain peace and stop wars. Some people used to worry that our movement to resist America and aid Korea would cause a world war. Now the facts prove that this movement is precisely one of the powerful guarantees to stop a world war."

　　Eleven professors from various departments of Tsinghua University published written opinions separately. Professor Hua Luogeng of the Mathematics Department said: "Stalin's speech not only educated us and pointed out the way for us to strive for peace, but also educated the people of capitalist countries, telling them: Why is their life getting tighter day by day? Why are prices getting higher day by day? Why are taxes getting heavier day by day? Why don't they have houses to live in? Why will they be unemployed? All these stem from one reason, that is because their governments are frantically engaged in war preparations. If they want to improve their lives initially, they have to strive for peace and stop wars." Professor Yu Guanying of the Chinese Department said: "The various construction projects currently underway in our motherland, such as diverting the Huai River and harnessing the Yellow River, are also powerful proofs of our peaceful policy. However, the American imperialists unreasonably slander us as 'aggressors'. The war traffickers have no so-called 'conscience' and no so-called 'sense of shame'." Professor Zhong Shimo of the Electrical Engineering Department said: "The power of the people can determine everything. Stalin's speech made us further appreciate the significance of the number '475 million'." Professors Zhang Xiruo, Tu Shou'e, Zhang Xiti, Zhou Peiyuan, Qian Weichang, Meng Xianmin, Wang Chengzhu, Shao Xunkge and others also expressed their opinions. They unanimously supported Stalin's speech, believing that: "This speech represents the will of peace-loving people all over the world."

　　In addition, Professors Qi Kaizhi and Li Jinxi of the Normal University, and Professors Gao Mingkai and Jiang Yin'en of Yenching University, all expressed their support for Stalin's speech.

　　Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "Marshal Stalin explained that world peace can be maintained, and it can and must be strived for. We must respond to Marshal Stalin's call and resolutely fight for the maintenance of peace and the striving for peace." In the speeches of Zhao Xianxian, He Tingjie, and Chen Zhengfei of the university, they also unanimously praised Stalin's policy of maintaining peace.

　　Liu Chijing, President of the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University, said: "Marshal Stalin's speech gave a very high evaluation to the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army." Professor Niu Zequan said: "The courageous and selfless fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, and the movement of the entire Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea, is a great contribution of our entire Chinese people to the cause of defending world peace."

　　首都各校教授纷纷发表意见

    【本报讯】首都各大学教授纷纷发表书面意见，对斯大林大元帅关于国际形势的谈话表示热诚拥护。
    北京大学校委会汤用彤主席认为：斯大林大元帅的谈话，肯定了正义的必然胜利。读了他的谈话以后，更加明了了抗美援朝的历史性意义，并应在多方面加强我们对保卫和平的努力。该校副教务长、中文系主任杨晦说：“斯大林大元帅给爱好和平的人民指出了怎样制止战争的道路，使我们明确认识了和平力量是强大的，而且更明确认识了我们所走的路就是维护和平制止战争的路。从前有人担心我们抗美援朝运动会引起世界大战，现在的事实证明，这个运动却正是制止世界大战的有力保证之一。”
    清华大学各系教授十一人分别发表书面意见。数学系华罗庚教授说：“斯大林的谈话，不但教育了我们，指示了我们争取和平的道路，而且也教育了资本主义国家的人民。告诉他们：为什么他们的生活一天比一天紧？为什么物价一天比一天高？为什么赋税一天比一天重？为什么他们没有房子住？为什么他们会失业？这些都是出于一个原因，就是因为他们的政府正在疯狂地进行战争准备。他们要想初步地改善他们的生活，就得去争取和平，制止战争。”中文系余冠英教授说：“我们祖国目前进行的种种建设事业，如导淮、治黄等，同样都是和平政策的有力证明，然而美帝却无理地诬我为‘侵略者’。战争贩子们是无所谓‘天良’，无所谓‘廉耻’的。”电机系钟士模教授说：“人民的力量可以决定一切。斯大林的谈话，使我们更加体会到‘四亿七千五百万’这个数字的意义。”张奚若、屠守锷、张席禔、周培源、钱伟长、孟宪民、王成组、邵循恪等教授亦发表了意见，他们对斯大林谈话一致拥护，认为：“这一谈话代表了全世界爱好和平人民的意志。”
    此外，师范大学祁开智、黎锦熙教授，燕京大学高名凯、蒋荫恩教授，都发表了拥护斯大林谈话的意见。
    辅仁大学陈垣校长说：“斯大林大元帅说明了世界和平是可以维护的，同时也是可以而且必须争取的。我们要响应斯大林大元帅的号召，为了维护和平，争取和平而坚决奋斗。”该校赵先贤、何挺杰、陈正飞教授等的谈话中，也一致赞扬斯大林维护和平的政策。
    北方交通大学北京铁道学院刘炽晶院长说：“斯大林大元帅的谈话，对于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇斗争给了一个很高的评价。”钮泽全教授说：“中国人民志愿军在朝鲜奋不顾身的英勇作战，全中国人民的抗美援朝运动，是我们全中国人民对于保卫世界和平事业的伟大贡献。”
