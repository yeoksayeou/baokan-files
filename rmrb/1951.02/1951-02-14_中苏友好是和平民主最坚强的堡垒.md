　　Sino-Soviet Friendship is the Strongest Bastion of Peace and Democracy
　　Jiu San Society
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has now reached its first anniversary.

    Due to the brotherly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp is unprecedentedly strong and growing. The imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism wants to expand its aggression plans and launch a world war, but it cannot but take into account that the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has constituted an invincible force politically and morally. This force will shatter all the evil conspiracies of the imperialist group to enslave the world, and give the aggressors a heavy blow anytime and anywhere.

    Therefore, the imperialists are always trying their best to provoke and alienate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. They have done a lot in the past, and now they still want to use some conspiracies to sabotage it. However, the situation is completely different now. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established their own regime. The Chinese people have become the masters of their own destiny. This has made the already deeply rooted friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people even more solid.

    The facts of the past year have also eloquently proved that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and this friendship has formed a Great Wall to defend the cause of world peace and democracy. In the past year, due to the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the imperialist aggression group has suffered a thorough failure militarily, politically, and morally. The aggressors headed by US imperialism used the United Nations to launch a war of aggression against Korea, and slanderously defamed our country as an "aggressor", but under the unyielding struggle of China and the Soviet Union and the protests of the people all over the world who are loyal to the cause of peace and justice, the imperialist group's conspiracies have been thoroughly bankrupted.

    Now, in order to persist in its military adventure policy, the US imperialist aggressors are actively carrying out the evil activities of a separate peace treaty with Japan and further arming Japan. This conspiracy has been resolutely opposed by the people all over the world. According to the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the basic policies towards Japan after its surrender agreed upon by the Far Eastern Commission, especially according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the people of China and the Soviet Union must unite with the peace-loving people of the world to oppose this evil act of US imperialism to expand its aggression plan and enslave the Japanese people, and fight to the end to defend world peace!

    For the lasting peace of the Far East and the world, and for the happy life of mankind, let the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, under the banner of the great Stalin and Chairman Mao, forever closely unite and advance hand in hand!

    Long live the permanent and indestructible friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live the victory of the cause of peace and democracy for mankind in the world!

　　中苏友好是和平民主最坚强的堡垒
　　九三学社
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订到现在恰恰是一周年。
    由于中国和苏联两国人民兄弟般的团结，世界和平民主阵营的力量是空前地坚强和壮大了。以美帝为首的帝国主义集团要想扩大侵略计划、发动世界战争，就不能不考虑到中苏两国的友好合作在政治上和道义上都已构成了不可战胜的力量。这个力量将粉碎帝国主义集团一切奴役世界的罪恶阴谋，随时随地给侵略者以沉重的打击。
    因之帝国主义者总是千方百计来挑拨离间中苏两国的友谊，过去它们做了很多，现在它们还是想用一些阴谋诡计来进行破坏。但是，现在的情形完全不同了。现在，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，已经推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了自己的政权，中国人民做了自己命运的主人。这样，就使一向具有深厚基础的中苏两国人民的友谊更加巩固了。
    一年来的事实也雄辩地证明了：中苏两国的友谊是牢不可破的，这种友谊结成了一条保卫世界和平民主事业的万里长城。一年以来，由于中苏两国的友好合作，使帝国主义的侵略集团在军事上、政治上和道义上都遭受到彻底的失败。以美帝为首的侵略者利用联合国机构发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并颠倒黑白地诽谤我国为“侵略者”，但在中苏两国不屈不挠的斗争及全世界忠于和平和正义事业的人民的抗议之下，帝国主义集团的阴谋诡计都彻头彻尾地破产了。
    现在，美帝国主义侵略强盗为了坚持其军事冒险政策，竟积极进行对日单独媾和与进一步武装日本的罪恶活动。这个阴谋活动已受到全世界人民的坚决反对。根据开罗会议宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告以及远东委员会各国同意通过的对投降后日本的基本政策，特别是根据中苏友好同盟互助条约的规定，中苏两国人民一定要联合全世界爱好和平的人民，反对美帝国主义这种扩大侵略计划、奴役日本人民的罪恶行为，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
    为了远东和世界的持久和平，为了人类的幸福生活，中苏两大国的人民在伟大的斯大林和毛主席的旗帜下，永远紧密的团结一致，携手前进吧！
    中苏两国人民永久不可摧毁的友谊万岁！
    世界人类和平与民主事业胜利万岁！
