    As we celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, looking back on the assistance provided by Soviet experts to China's fuel industry construction over the past year fills us with boundless excitement and joy.
    First and foremost, we must mention the establishment of the "Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company." Through this company, the Soviet Union has provided technical, human, and material assistance in establishing an industrial zone in the desert regions of remote Xinjiang Province to develop "the element of modern industry – petroleum," allowing China's petroleum industry to escape the quagmire of decades of colonial and semi-colonial status and laying the foundation for a self-reliant petroleum industry. The growth and development of China's petroleum industry will greatly change the face of China's industrial production.
    In production and construction, the Soviet Union has sent various experts to assist us. Soviet experts have left their footprints in China's coal mines, oil fields, and power plants. Under difficult material living conditions, they have provided the Chinese people with advanced Soviet science and technology and production management experience, enabling China's coal mining, electricity, and petroleum industries to escape their backward production status and create new technological records.
    In the past year, China's coal mining industry has achieved great accomplishments in implementing new coal mining methods and improving mine safety, which are the result of the concrete assistance of Soviet experts. To ensure a sufficient supply of industrial fuel in the next five to six years, Soviet experts have also helped us formulate principles and plans for constructing new mines.
    In 1950, the utilization rate of China's state-owned electric power industry equipment increased by 20.12% compared to 1949, and the equipment output increased from 65% to 78.8%. Considerable achievements have also been made in increasing the safety of power supply. These achievements have been created by Chinese electricity workers through continuous efforts under the help and encouragement of Soviet experts. Soviet experts have also provided valuable opinions on the standardization of technical standards for China's newly built and improved power plants, saving us from many detours. Soviet experts are also helping us formulate unified national technical operating procedures for power plants, which will further improve China's electric power industry.
    With the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government established an Electric Power Technology Research Class on January 1, 1951. Soviet experts volunteered to serve as lecturers, tirelessly teaching young engineers transferred from power plants across the country, in order to improve the technical level of China's electric power technicians. These young engineers will learn many new work styles, work methods, and work techniques from Soviet experts, and bring these things back to power plants across the country. The spirit of Soviet experts in providing us with technical experience without reservation makes us feel a brotherly friendship.

　　苏联对我国燃料工业建设的帮助
　　中央燃料工业部通讯组
    在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约订立周年的时候，回顾一年来苏联专家对于我国燃料工业建设的帮助，使人感到无限的兴奋和愉快。
    我们首先应该提到的，是“中苏石油股份公司”的成立。经过这个公司，苏联在技术、人力、物力上帮助我们在辽远的新疆省的沙漠地区，建立了开发“现代工业的要素——石油”的工业区，使我国的石油工业跳出了几十年来的殖民地和半殖民地的泥坑，奠定了自力更生的石油工业的基础。我国石油工业的生长和发展，将促使我国工业生产的面貌大为改观。
    在生产建设中，苏联派了各种专家来帮助我们。苏联专家的足迹踏遍了我国的煤矿、油矿和电厂，他们在困难的物质生活条件下，把苏联的先进科学技术和生产管理经验提供给中国人民，使我国的煤矿、电业和石油工业摆脱了落后的生产状态，创造了技术的新纪录。
    一年来我国的煤矿工业在实行新采煤方法和改进矿井保安等工作上都获得了巨大的成就，这是苏联专家具体帮助的结果。为了保证今后五、六年中的工业燃料的充分供应，苏联专家更帮助我们制订了建设新矿井的原则和计划。
    一九五○年我国国营电力工业设备的利用率比一九四九年提高了百分之二十·一二，设备出力由百分之六十五提高到百分之七十八·八，在增进供电安全上也得到了相当的成绩。这些成绩都是中国电业职工在苏联专家的帮助和鼓励之下不断努力所创造出来的。对于我国新建电厂和改进电厂的技术标准的统一，苏联专家也提供了很宝贵的意见，使我们少走许多弯路。苏联专家还正在帮助我们制定全国统一的发电厂的技术运行规程，这将使我国的电力工业得到进一步的提高。
    在苏联专家的热忱帮助之下，中央人民政府燃料工业部在一九五一年一月一日设立了电业技术研究班。苏联专家们都自愿担任讲师，孜孜不倦地教导该班从全国各地电厂调来的青年工程师，以便把我国电业技术人员的技术水平提高一步。这些青年工程师们将从苏联专家那里学到许多新的工作作风、工作方法和工作技术，并把这些东西带到各地电厂去。苏联专家这种毫无保留地把技术经验提供给我们的精神，使我们感到兄弟般的友谊。
