Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　The first session of the Third Tianjin Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference was held from the 1st to the 3rd. Since the second session, the Tianjin Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference has exercised the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress for one year, which has now expired. This conference reviewed the work of the Municipal People's Government Committee over the past year, determined the work guidelines for 1951, and re-elected the Municipal People's Government Committee and the Consultative Committee of the Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference.

　　At the meeting, Mayor Huang Jing summarized the work of the past year and put forward the work guidelines for this year in his opening speech. He pointed out that 1950 was a year of great development and progress in various construction works in Tianjin. Total production in 1950 increased by about 40 percent compared to 1949. The production efficiency of both public and private enterprises greatly exceeded the highest level during the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Japanese puppet regime. The volume of export trade increased threefold compared to 1949. With the development of production, the lives of the working people are constantly improving. More than 70,000 workers have entered evening schools. Maternal and child health stations and nurseries have been established in various factories, and health clinics and medical stations have been set up in various districts, especially in the districts where the working people live. Last year's construction work in roads and sewers was equal to the total of eleven years during the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Japanese puppet regime. Construction expenses accounted for more than 70 percent of the Municipal People's Government's total expenditure last year. All construction is primarily aimed at improving the living conditions of the working people. Mayor Huang Jing said that there were also shortcomings in the work of the past year. For example, some work focused too much on development, and the work of consolidation and deepening was not done enough, which should be strived to overcome in the future.

　　The meeting discussed and approved the work report of the Municipal People's Government Committee, and decided that the work guidelines for Tianjin this year are: to consolidate national defense, continue to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country; to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; to consolidate the existing gains in financial and economic work and to develop production with emphasis; to strengthen ideological education on consolidating national defense, patriotism, and internationalism, to improve the cultural level of workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres, to improve the quality of teaching in school education, and to protect the health of the working people; to consolidate the existing achievements of municipal construction and to carry out new projects with emphasis. The meeting reviewed and handled the proposals received, focusing on resolving the problem of housing rental disputes among citizens. The meeting re-elected the Municipal People's Government Committee and elected Huang Huoqing, Li Zhuchen, and other forty-seven people as members of the Consultative Committee of the Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference.

　　The preparatory work for this meeting was very thorough. The work report of the Municipal People's Government Committee in 1950 and the method of electing representatives to the meeting were distributed to all sectors of the city as early as the beginning of January. From various people's organizations to the adult citizens of various neighborhoods, factories, and workshops, heated discussions were conducted for this purpose. The people from all walks of life carefully elected their own representatives through a combination of consultation and election, taking a step forward from the previous method of simple consultation. Therefore, the representativeness of the meeting was more extensive, and the number of representatives increased from 424 in the previous session to 510 in this session. Citizens generally expressed in discussing the government work report that the construction achievements of the past year fully demonstrated the superiority of the people's democratic system.

　　津市各界代表会闭幕
　  检查工作改选市府委员会
    【新华社讯】天津市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议已于一日至三日举行。该市各界人民代表会议自第二届开始，已代行市人民代表大会职权，迄今一年，已届满期。这次会议检查了市人民政府委员会一年来的工作和确定了一九五一年的工作方针，并改选了市人民政府委员会和市各界人民代表会议协商委员会。
    会上，黄敬市长在开幕词中总结了去年全年工作和提出了今年的工作方针。他指出：一九五○年是天津市各项建设工作都有巨大发展和进步的一年。一九五○年全年生产比一九四九年增加了百分之四十左右。不论公营或私营企业的生产效率都大大地超过了国民党反动政府和日伪统治时期的最高水平。出口贸易额比一九四九年增加了三倍。随着生产的发展，劳动人民的生活正不断得到改善。七万多工人进了业余学校。各工厂里建立了妇幼保健站和托儿所，各区特别是劳动人民居住的区，设立了卫生事务所、医疗站。去年一年在道路和下水道方面的建设工作，等于国民党反动政府和日伪统治时期十一年的总和。市人民政府去年全部支出中，建设费用占百分之七十以上。所有建设，首先是为了改善劳动人民的生活条件。黄敬市长说：一年来的工作中也是有缺点的。例如有些工作偏重了发展，巩固和深入的工作还做得不够，这是今后应该努力克服的。
    会议讨论并通过了市人民政府委员会的工作报告，并决定天津市今年的工作方针是：巩固国防，继续深入开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动；进一步巩固人民民主专政；巩固在财政经济工作上已有的收获及有重点地发展生产；加强巩固国防教育、爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，提高工农群众和工农干部的文化水平，提高学校教育中的教学质量，保护劳动人民健康；巩固市政建设的已有成果，并有重点地举办新工程。会议审查和处理了收到的提案，着重解决了市民房屋租赁纠纷问题。会议改选了市人民政府委员会，并选出黄火青、李烛尘等四十七人为市各界人民代表会议协商委员会委员。
    这次会议的会前准备工作很充分。市人民政府委员会一九五○年的工作报告和选举会议代表的办法，早于一月初即已分发该市各界人民。从各人民团体直至各里巷、工厂车间的成年市民，都为此进行了热烈的讨论。各界人民以协商结合选举的方法慎重地选出了自己的代表，把过去单纯协商的方法提高了一步。因此，会议的代表性更加广泛了，代表人数也由上届的四百二十四人增为本届的五百一十人。市民们在讨论政府工作报告时普遍表示：去年的建设成绩，充分证明了人民民主制度的优越。
