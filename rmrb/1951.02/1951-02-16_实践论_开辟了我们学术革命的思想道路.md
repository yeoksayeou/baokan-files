　　"On Practice" Opens Up the Ideological Path for Our Academic Revolution

　　In the past two years, with the victory of the people's great revolution, the national academic community has begun its own revolution. The characteristic of this beginning of the academic revolution is that the viewpoint of historical materialism has fundamentally and on a very large scale destroyed historical idealism and historical mysticism. The view that labor creates human history has been accepted by a very large number of intellectuals and has become the ideological foundation for the conscious transformation of the vast number of intellectuals.

　　But this is only the beginning of our academic revolution. This academic revolution must continue to advance in depth in order to achieve greater results. This means applying the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism specifically to various academic departments, and earnestly engaging in systematic, rather than piecemeal, critical and research work.

　　The Chinese academic community has made extremely glorious contributions in history. We also have a very rich historical tradition of materialism. For decades, the progressive academic community in China has done a lot of work that is beneficial to the people's cause. However, there is also a fact that we cannot deny, and that is: the real achievements of our modern academic community are still very, very few. Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly carried out the various fundamental theoretical tasks required by the Chinese revolution. His theoretical work always stood in front of practice, thus leading the advancement of revolutionary practice. However, as far as our academic community itself is concerned, it is not good at learning Comrade Mao Zedong's method of conducting theoretical work. The work of our academic community lags far behind the needs of the people, and theory lags behind practice.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report on rectification in 1942 that we must strive to publicize materialism and dialectics in order to overcome the backwardness of the theoretical front. The problem remains the same now: to overcome the backwardness of our work in academic aspects, and to raise our academic work to a level that is fully suitable for the construction of the new China of the people, and to raise it to a higher level, we must vigorously publicize materialism and dialectics. However, Comrade Mao Zedong's so-called "publicity" does not refer to that kind of verbal shouting, but refers to the kind of work that must be done diligently and painstakingly in accordance with the theories and methods of materialism and dialectics.

　　To publicize materialism and dialectics means that we must continue to carry out revolutionary critical battles against the scholastic school that has been inherited from feudal society with its mysticism and formalism, and against the various reactionary ideological trends of idealism and mysticism in modern China that are either native or trafficked from the reactionary bourgeoisie of the West.

　　To publicize materialism and dialectics means that we must use materialism and dialectics to establish our true historical science and to develop our natural science.

　　Of course, all this work cannot be solved by slogans or banners, nor can it be solved by using some poor knowledge to rigidly apply several abstract formulas. Here, we can only rely on the serious collection of a large amount of materials and serious research.

　　Engels said it very precisely: "Even the development of the materialist viewpoint in a single historical instance is a scientific undertaking that requires years of quiet study. Because it is obvious that empty talk is useless here. Only a majority of critically selected and thoroughly studied historical materials can solve such a topic." (Engels: "Critique of Marx's Political Economy").

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" is precisely the great banner for our propaganda of materialism, and it points out to us how to engage in the work of academic revolution in accordance with the path of materialism.

　　There is no need to be shy about saying that the most important reason why our progressive academic community has achieved so little in the long term, from its own point of view, is that it has rendered "materialism" an empty phrase. Very, very few people have worked on materials that have been carefully studied for a problem, or that have been critically selected for a lot of materials. The following situation often occurs: some simple materials are copied back and forth among many people for a long time, so that even the copier does not know its source. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only when the sensory materials are very rich (not fragmented and incomplete) and in line with reality (not illusions) can correct concepts and theories be created based on such materials." But many of our academic workers actually look down on and even deny sensory materials, not to mention having "very rich" sensory materials, so their "academic work" has become what Comrade Mao Zedong called "water without a source, tree without roots." The result of such so-called "academic work" can of course only be tragic.

　　Since such so-called "academic workers" have made "materialism" an empty phrase, many people try their best to avoid the study of modern problems and current problems. They only like to focus on talking about ancient times but do not like to study modern times, or they only like to focus on talking about foreign stories but do not like to study things that are close at hand. This is because the things of ancient times or foreign stories are very far away from us, which can facilitate long-term empty talk with each other, and there is no need to seek serious solutions urgently.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the situation in our social history academic circles in his work "Reform Our Study" in May 1941: "The economic history of the last hundred years, the political history of the last hundred years, the military history of the last hundred years, the cultural history of the last hundred years, almost no one has seriously started to study. Some people have no knowledge of their own things, so they are left with Greek and foreign stories (limited to stories); it is also very pitiful to abstractly move them from foreign old paper piles." Comrade Mao Zedong said these words almost ten years ago from now, but it should be admitted that the achievements of our entire academic community are still very low.

　　Yes, in our academic community, some people have also engaged in collecting materials on certain issues, and they are some very valuable materials. However, these people still only worked for the materials and stopped their work halfway, and as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, they "do not know that sensory materials are of course reflections of certain realities of the objective outside world, but they are only one-sided and superficial, this reflection is incomplete, and does not reflect the essence of things." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The real task of cognition lies in reaching thinking through sensation, reaching a gradual understanding of the internal contradictions of objective things, understanding its regularity, understanding the internal connection between this process and that process, that is, reaching logical cognition." Without raising the sensory materials to logical cognition, that is, without seriously engaging in research work. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to have truly good results.

　　Marx wrote the following famous words in the preface to the French translation of "Capital": "There is no smooth road to go on in science, only those who climb up without fear of hardship and danger have the hope of climbing to the brilliant peak." This is extremely correct. In fact, the entire process of cognitive movement pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" is telling us: what kind of hardships and dangers there will inevitably be on the road of science, and how we should spare no effort to overcome the dangers that we will inevitably encounter. When collecting very rich and realistic sensory materials, this will of course encounter many dangers and experience a great deal of hardship; when "transforming the rich sensory materials by removing the crude and preserving the fine, removing the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and proceeding from the surface to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories," this will of course encounter many dangers again and experience an even greater deal of hardship.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong often mentioned the possibility of failure and the possibility of error in his work "On Practice," and pointed out how we should turn failure into victory and turn error into correctness. This inspiration is extremely important.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

　　"Generally speaking, whether in the practice of transforming nature or transforming society, there are very few things in which people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs are realized without any changes. This is because people engaged in changing reality are often subject to many restrictions, not only often subject to scientific conditions and technical conditions, but also subject to the development of the objective process and the degree of its expression (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not been fully exposed). Under such circumstances, it is common to partially change ideas, theories, plans, and programs due to the discovery of unforeseen circumstances in practice, and it is also possible to change them completely. That is to say, it is possible that the original ideas, theories, plans, and programs are partially or completely inconsistent with reality, partially wrong, or completely wrong. Many times, one must repeatedly fail many times before correcting erroneous understanding, before reaching conformity with the regularity of the objective process, and thus being able to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, to obtain the expected results in practice."

　　Of course, the practice of academic work is the same. However, many workers in our academic community always expect to succeed once they start writing, or "write ten thousand words a day, waiting on horseback," and once they encounter setbacks, they lose their perseverance. If things are seen as so easy, then one will certainly not truly understand what the practice of academics is, and will not "achieve the expected goal" in any academic field, and will not "obtain the expected result."

　　The re-publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" should arouse the unfolding of our academic revolution. In all aspects and departments of our academic community, we should seriously discuss "On Practice," and link the review of our work with this discussion, and adopt an orderly and appropriate attitude, rather than a rude attitude, so as to improve our work.

　　Our revolutionary experience and historical heritage are extremely rich, this is one aspect. On the other hand, the victory of the people's great revolution and the needs of new national construction have opened up extremely vast "fields for heroes" for our academic community in all aspects. Our existing academic research work now needs more and deeper work; there are of course many academic research works that we have not yet reclaimed, and now we need to vigorously engage in reclamation. Engels once criticized in a letter that few young Germans at that time used materialism as a guide to conduct serious research work, and pointed out that the field of research is infinitely large, "Whoever is willing to do it seriously can achieve a lot and can stand out." ("Letter to Schmidt") Engels's opinion is also completely appropriate here.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice," this great banner of materialism, will open a new historical page for the work of the Chinese academic revolution. As long as we can truly understand the profound ideas of "On Practice" and seriously transform it into academic practice, then the emergence of great achievements in the Chinese academic community is completely predictable.

### “实践论”开辟了我们学术革命的思想道路

　　“实践论”开辟了我们学术革命的思想道路
    近两年来，随着人民大革命的胜利，全国学术界已经开始自己的革命。这个学术界革命开端的特点，就是历史唯物论的观点从根底和极大规模地破坏了历史的唯心论和历史的神秘主义。劳动创造人类历史的观点，已经被极广大的知识分子所接受，并成为广大的知识分子进行自觉改造的思想基础。
    但这只是我们学术革命的开端。这个学术革命必须继续深入地前进，以求获得更大的结果。这就是要把辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点与方法具体地应用于各种学术的部门，认真地从事各种有系统的、而不是以枝节举例为满足的批判的和研究的工作。
    中国学术界在历史上有过极其光荣的贡献。我们也有很丰富的唯物论的历史传统。几十年来，中国进步的学术界做了许多有利于人民事业的工作。但是，有一种事实也是我们所不能否认的，这就是：我们近代学术界工作的真正成就，还是很少很少的。毛泽东同志极其光辉地执行了中国革命所需要的各种根本理论工作的任务，他的理论工作总是站在实践的前面，因而领导了革命实践的前进。但是，就我们学术界本身来说，却还不善于学习毛泽东同志进行理论工作的方法，我们学术界的工作大大地落后于人民的需要，理论落后于实际。
    毛泽东同志在一九四二年的整风报告曾经指出，我们必须努力宣传唯物论，宣传辩证法，以克服理论战线的落后。现在的问题仍然同样：要克服我们在学术方面工作的落后，而使我们的学术工作提高到完全适合于人民新中国的建设的需要，提高到更高的水平，这就必须大力宣传唯物论，宣传辩证法。但毛泽东同志的所谓“宣传”，并不是指那种口头的空嚷，而是指那种必须按照唯物论和辩证法的理论和方法，从事埋头刻苦的工作。
    宣传唯物论，宣传辩证法，这就是说，必须对着那种从封建社会沿袭下来的神秘主义和烦琐主义的经院学派，对着近代中国那些或是土生的、或是从西方反动资产阶级那里贩运来的各种唯心论和神秘主义的反动思潮，继续进行革命的批判的战斗。
    宣传唯物论，宣传辩证法，这就是说，必须用唯物论和辩证法来建立我们真正的历史科学，来发展我们的自然科学。
    当然，这一切工作，绝不是用口号或标语所能解决的，也不是用一些贫困的知识去硬套若干抽象的公式所能解决的。这里只能依靠认真的搜集大量材料和认真的研究。
    恩格斯是说得非常精确的：“即令是唯物的观点在一个单独的历史实例上的发展，也是一种需要数年静心研究的科学事业。因为很明显的，在这里，徒托空言是无益的。只有多数经过批判的选择与全部精细研究过的历史材料，才能解决这样一个课题。”（恩格斯：《马克思的政治经济学批判》）。
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》，正是我们宣传唯物论的伟大旗帜，它给我们指出了如何按照唯物论的道路去从事学术革命的工作。
    不用讳言：我们进步的学术界在长时期中所以成就很少，就自己方面来说，最重要的原因，乃是在于把《唯物论》徒托空言。对于一个问题精细研究过材料，或者对于很多材料加以批判的选择，这样工作过的人是很少很少的。时常出现这样的情况：若干简单的材料在很多人中间长期抄袭来抄袭去，以致连抄者都还弄不清楚它的出处。毛泽东同志说：“只有感觉的材料十分丰富（不是零碎不全）与合于实际（不是错觉），才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念与论理来。”但我们的许多学术工作者实际上看轻了、以至否定了感觉的材料，更不用说有什么“十分丰富”的感觉的材料，因此，他们的“学术工作”也就变成了如毛泽东同志所说的“无源之水，无本之木”。这样的所谓“学术工作”，结果当然只能是可悲的。
    这样的所谓“学术工作者”既然把《唯物论》徒托空言，所以很多人极力逃避对于现代问题和当前问题的研究。他们只喜欢集中谈论古代而不喜欢研究近代，或者只喜欢集中谈论外国的故事而不喜欢研究切近的事物。这些乃是因为古代的事情或外国的故事，究竟离我们很远，就可以便利于彼此长期空论不休，并不需要急求认真的解决。
    毛泽东同志在一九四一年五月间关于《改造我们的学习》的著作中，对于我们社会历史学术界方面的状况，曾经这样指出：“近百年的经济史，近百年的政治史，近百年的军事史，近百年的文化史，简直还没有人认真动手去研究。有些人对于自己的东西既无知识，于是剩下希腊及外国故事（限于故事）；也是可怜得很，从外国故纸堆中抽象地搬来的。”毛泽东同志说这些话时，离现在已经将近十年，但是应该承认：我们整个学术界的成绩还是很低微的。
    是的，在我们的学术界中，也有些人从事搜集过某些问题的材料，而且是一些很可宝贵的材料。但是，这些人结果还只是为材料而材料，这些人把自己工作停在半路上，而正如毛泽东同志所指出的，他们“不知道感觉材料固然是客观外界某些真实性的反映，但它们仅是片面的与表面的东西，这种反映是不完全的，是没有反映事物本质的”。毛泽东同志说：“认识的真正任务在于经过感觉而到达于思维，到达于逐步了解客观事物的内部矛盾，了解它的规律性，了解这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系，即到达于论理的认识。”没有把感觉的材料提高到论理的认识，这就是说，没有认真地从事研究的工作。在这种情况下，要有真正好的成绩，乃是不可能的。
    马克思在《资本论》法文译本序言里写过以下有名的话：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在攀登上不畏劳苦不畏险阻的人，有希望攀到光辉的顶点。”这是极端正确的。事实上，毛泽东同志的《实践论》所指出的认识运动的全部过程，正是告诉了我们：在科学的路上必然会有怎样的劳苦和险阻，而我们应该怎样不惜劳苦地去克服必然遇到的险阻。在搜集十分丰富和合于实际的感觉材料的时候，这当然是要遇到许多险阻，并经历一番极大的劳苦；在“将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念及理论的系统”的时候，这当然又是要遇到许多险阻，并经历一番更大的劳苦。
    毛泽东同志在《实践论》这个著作中常常提到失败的可能性和错误的可能性，而指出我们应该怎样去变失败为胜利和变错误为正确，这个启发是极端重要的。
    毛泽东同志写道：
    “一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件与技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。在这种情形之下，由于实践中发现前所未料的情况，因而部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是有的。即是说，原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，部分地或全部地不合于实际，部分错了或全部错了的事，都是有的。许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。”
    当然，学术工作的实践也是同样的。但我们学术界许多工作者，总只期望自己一旦笔到功成，或者“日试万言，倚马可待”，而一遇挫折，便丧失了自己的毅力。把事情看得这样容易，就当然不会真正懂得什么是学术的实践，就不会在任何学术上“实现了预想的目的”，不会“得到预想的结果”。
    毛泽东同志《实践论》的重新发表，应该引起我们学术革命的展开。在我们的学术界各方面，各部门，应该认真地讨论《实践论》，而把自己工作的检讨和这个讨论联系起来，采取有秩序的恰当的态度，而不是采取粗暴的态度，从而改进自己的工作。
    我们的革命经验和历史遗产都是极端丰富的，这是一方面。另一方面，人民大革命的胜利和新国家建设的需要则给我们各方面的学术界开辟了极其广大的“英雄用武之地”。我们已经存在的学术研究工作，现在需要更多和更深入的工作；我们还没有开垦的学术研究工作当然很多很多，现在则需要大力从事开垦。恩格斯曾经有封信批评当时德国青年很少有人用唯物论作向导去认真地进行研究工作，而指出研究的领域是无限地大，“谁只要肯认真地去做，就可以有很多成就，就能够出人头地。”（“给史密特的信”）恩格斯的这个意见在我们这里也是完全合适的。
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》这个唯物论的伟大旗帜，将使中国学术革命的工作开辟了新的历史的一页。只要我们真正能够领略《实践论》的深刻思想，并认真地把它转化为学术的实践，那末，中国学术界将出现伟大的成果，那是完全是可以预卜的。
