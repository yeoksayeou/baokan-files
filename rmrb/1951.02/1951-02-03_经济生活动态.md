　　　　Post Offices Launch "Inquiry" and "Goods Purchasing" Services
　　To promote material exchange between regions, post offices nationwide have launched "inquiry" and "goods purchasing" services. The "inquiry" service allows post offices to leverage their widespread network of locations across the country to help the public investigate local specialties (both industrial and agricultural), as well as their sales channels, prices, transportation, and other related information. Over the past year, the post office's inquiry service has been widely used by people in various regions. According to statistics from November of last year, the Zhejiang postal district handled over four thousand cases, while the Guangdong postal district handled over two thousand nine hundred cases. The "goods purchasing" service allows purchasers to entrust the post office to purchase and transport goods from manufacturers in other places with post offices. In addition, the "inquiry" service also includes inquiries about publications and schools in other places, as well as news of lost relatives.
　　　　North China State-Owned Industries Fully Completed Last Year's Production Plan
　　Thanks to the widespread implementation of democratic management and enterprise-based operations in various factories and mines, as well as the promotion of production emulation campaigns, state-owned industries in the North China region fully completed their production plan for 1950. The output of coal, iron, rolled steel, coke, cement, and electricity sales even exceeded the plan by 0.75 to 21.1 percent. Among them, the output of iron, rolled steel, coke, and cement exceeded the highest historical records. The output of yarn and cloth also exceeded the original plan.
