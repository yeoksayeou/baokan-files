　　Xiamen Municipal People's Government
    Helps Poor Returned Overseas Chinese Spend Spring Festival
    Hundreds of Overseas Chinese Expelled and Returned Home Settle in Hainan Island
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Xiamen Overseas Chinese Association, in order to help poor returned overseas Chinese and their families spend a warm Spring Festival, specifically forwarded a large number of relief goods allocated by the Xiamen Municipal People's Government to poor returned overseas Chinese and their families on February 1 (i.e., December 25th of the lunar calendar). A total of 309 households, comprising 1,050 people, received the relief. The relief goods issued included more than 1,000 packages of clothing (each package containing three or four pieces), some cotton quilts and blankets, some canned food, and over 14.4 million yuan in cash. Some of these poor returned overseas Chinese and their families had all their wealth accumulated through hard work completely confiscated when they were unreasonably expelled by the British colonial authorities recently. They were extremely grateful for the People's Government's concern and care.
    One hundred of our overseas Chinese compatriots, who were expelled by the British colonial authorities in Malaya and returned to the country, have recently arrived in Haikou City in batches from Shantou and Guangzhou and will settle down and engage in production on Hainan Island. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Hainan Military and Political Committee held a welcome meeting on January 27. The returned overseas Chinese compatriots were very indignant at the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in persecuting overseas Chinese and felt extremely close to the new atmosphere of the motherland. They all expressed their determination to participate in the construction of the motherland with the greatest effort.

　　厦门市人民政府
    帮助贫苦归侨过春节       
    被逐返国侨胞百人安家海南岛
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：厦门市归国华侨联谊会为帮助贫苦归国侨胞及侨眷温暖地度过春节，特于二月一日（即农历十二月二十五日）转发厦门市人民政府拨出的大批救济品给贫苦的归国侨胞与侨眷。接受救济的共有三百零九户，一千零五十人。发出的救济品有衣服一千余包（每包三四件不等），棉被毛毯、食品罐头各一部，及现款一千四百四十余万元。这些贫苦的归国侨胞及侨眷，一部分在最近被英国殖民地当局无理驱逐出境时，他们以血汗积累的财产，竟被全部剥夺，他们对于人民政府如此的关心与爱护，极为感激。
    被马来亚英国殖民当局驱逐归国的我国侨胞，最近已有一百人由汕头和广州分批安抵海口市，将在海南岛安家生产。海南军政委员会侨务局在一月二十七日举行了欢迎大会。归国侨胞们对英国殖民当局迫害华侨的暴行非常愤慨，对祖国的新气象感到无比的亲切。他们都表示决心以最大的努力来参加祖国的建设工作。
