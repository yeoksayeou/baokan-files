　　Zhang Zhenxi, Deputy Secretary of the Tong County First District Party Committee, Emphasizes Cultural Learning
    Comrade Zhang Zhenxi, Deputy Secretary of the Tong County First District Party Committee, is already forty years old. He only attended school for half a year in his childhood. After joining the revolution, he didn't have the opportunity to learn culture in the long-term guerrilla warfare environment, and even had difficulties writing simple work summaries and reports. In the past, he often went to the villages to work and was unwilling to stay in the office. Because his cultural level was not high, his understanding of the spirit of the policies was not deep, and he could not carry out propaganda and education to the masses well in his work, so his work was not done well. This gradually made him realize the importance of learning.
    Last October, the county equipped the district cadres with cultural teachers and stipulated a learning system. He started with arithmetic class, but he couldn't make heads or tails of it after listening for a long time. When he encountered difficulties in learning like this, he lost confidence. He felt that he was old, his brain was no longer useful, and he was afraid that he would not be able to finish learning a book in three years. But when he thought of the difficulties he had encountered in his work due to a lack of culture, and when he thought of the complex tasks of building a new China, after continuous ideological struggle, he was determined to step up his learning. He was diligent and humble in his studies, and he read until after 12 o'clock every night when everyone else was asleep. He often went to the teacher to ask for help until he understood it. He often said to others, "You must persevere in learning culture." As a responsible comrade of a district, his work is busy, but he was not overwhelmed by his busy work. In order to squeeze out time to study, he went to bed late and got up early. When he went to the countryside, he would silently write phonetic symbols on his clothes with his fingers while walking.
    Comrade Zhang Zhenxi not only studied well himself, but also urged other district cadres to study. He often said to other comrades, "I am so old and can still learn, you young people should work harder." He found that some comrades could not put down their "cadre airs" and were unwilling to ask the teacher when they did not understand. He criticized this dishonest attitude towards learning and told everyone about his own experience of asking others for help. With his help, the learning of the cadres in the whole district also became serious, and everyone took Zhang Zhenxi as a role model for learning.

　　通县一区区委副书记张振锡重视文化学习
    中共通县一区区委副书记张振锡同志已四十岁了，他只在小时候上过半年学。参加革命以后，在长期的游击战争环境里得不到学习文化的机会，就连写简单的工作总结、报告等都有困难。他过去经常到村里去工作，不愿留在机关里。因为文化程度不高，体会政策的精神就不深刻，工作中不能很好的向群众进行宣传教育，所以工作做不好。这使他慢慢感到学习的重要。
    去年十月，县里给区干部配备了文化教员，规定了学习制度。开始上算术课，他听来听去摸不着头脑。这样学习一遇到困难，他就失去了信心，他感到自己年纪大了，脑筋不中用了，恐怕一本书三年也学不完。但是他一想到在工作中因缺乏文化所受的困难，又想起建设新中国的复杂任务，经过不断地思想斗争，他就下决心加紧学习。他在学习中刻苦，虚心，每天晚上十二点以后，别人都睡了他还读书。他经常找教员去求教，直到弄明白了才算完事。他经常向别人说：“学习文化一定要坚持得住才行。”一个区的负责同志工作是繁忙的，但他并没有被繁忙的工作压倒。为了挤出时间学习，他晚睡早起，下乡时，一面走路一面还用指头在衣服上默写注音符号。
    张振锡同志不仅个人学习得好，还督促其他区干部学习，他经常向其他同志说：“我这样大的年纪还能学习，你们年轻更应该努力学习。”他发现有的同志放不下“干部架子”，不懂的不肯去问教员，他就批判这种不老实的学习态度。并把自己向别人求教的事实讲给大家听。在他的帮助下，全区干部的学习也认真起来，大家都以张振锡作为学习的榜样。
