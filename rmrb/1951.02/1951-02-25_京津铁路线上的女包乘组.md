　　Female Attendant Crew on the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Line
　　Xiao Xi
　　The twenty-first and twenty-second express trains between Beijing and Tianjin are always so satisfactory. The train's facilities are excellent. People boarding the third-class carriage, seeing the shiny, painted cloth-covered seats, even doubt whether they have boarded the wrong train. But this is not the main thing. The most important thing is that the female attendant crew on this train manages it well, earning the praise of passengers.
　　When people step into Carriage B of this train, they can see the female train chiefs and assistant train chiefs wearing blue uniforms and red armbands. They are busy answering various questions from passengers in a kind and approachable manner. Besides the driver and stoker, the train also has passenger conductors, operations conductors, train attendants, and baggage handlers wearing blue uniforms and red armbands; public security officers carrying short guns and wearing green military uniforms; salespersons wearing white work clothes and carrying food baskets; as well as electrical technicians managing the lights and electricity; and inspectors checking the machinery. All are female staff members with excellent service spirit.
　　Even though more than a thousand passengers board and disembark this train in Beijing and Tianjin, the crew always patiently cleans it thoroughly. The carriages are clean, the windows are sparkling, the chairs and tea tables are almost spotless, and the flush toilets in the restrooms are scrubbed as clean as washbasins, with no odor. Each carriage has a bookcase with newly published illustrated magazines for passengers to choose and read at their leisure. When passengers are flipping through illustrated magazines and listening to the train's broadcast programs, they may feel as comfortable as they do at home. No wonder some passengers, recalling the chaotic situation inside trains during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, wrote in the suggestion book on the train: "I have been taking trains for more than twenty years, and this is the first time I feel happy."
　　What is most touching is the female attendants' meticulous care for passengers. They often carefully assist elderly women and young children in boarding and alighting, saying, "We treat them as if they were our own mothers and children." They sometimes help female passengers lift luggage onto the luggage racks; when there are many people on Saturdays and Sundays, they would rather not sit themselves and give their crew rest room to the passengers. They give special care to passengers with special difficulties. Once, an old woman with a heart condition could not sit on the train, so they let her lie down in the train chief's office. When she got off the train, they helped her out of the station and hired a car for her. After the old woman recovered, she took the train again for the second time, smiling at the attendants and saying, "See how fat I am, I really like taking your train." Many passengers enthusiastically tell the attendants their addresses when they get off the train, saying, "Come to my house to play when you have time," or "I will take your train again next time."
　　Last year, on "March 8th" International Women's Day, when the first group of female train drivers in China appeared in Dalian, the Beijing Train Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration also saw the emergence of China's first female crew group managing train services. At that time, the Tianjin Railway Administration was determined to start training a group of female attendants, calling on women to intensify their study of technology and become familiar with business. Inspired by the Party and the Communist Youth League, and influenced by Tian Guiying's successful learning to drive a train, more than fifty women signed up to participate. However, most of them were rejected because of poor health or because they were burdened with children, and only eleven people, including Yan Yuzhen, Huang Qingmei, Zheng Yukui, and Sun Yizhi, were approved to participate. Thus, a major event occurred in the Tianjin Railway Administration. Female staff members, who were previously thought to be only capable of doing clerical work or answering telephones, could now also learn to manage trains. Some people had doubts in their minds, saying, "A train is like a tiger, a tiger eats people until it is full, but a train never gets its fill. There is still some danger for men, can women do it?" Therefore, some people said to the female crew members, "What's so good about working on the train? Look at you in this big office, with big desks and large glass panels, it's much more comfortable." Others said, "What is train service work? Emptying spittoons and wiping train panels, is that what you call train service work." But their answers were very firm. They said, "What men can do, we can also do. We are not going to the train to enjoy ourselves, we are not afraid of hardship." They swore to resolutely complete the tasks given by the Party and the administration.
　　On April 5th last year, the female crew group was warmly welcomed to the Tianjin Train Section for an internship. Train service work is not as simple as some people imagine. The safety of a trainload of people is the responsibility of the crew. When the train starts moving, it is indeed more formidable than a tiger. Many difficulties arose at that time. After the leading cadres learned about it, they immediately sent a male comrade to guide the work on the train, and also invited the veteran model crew members in the train section to discuss their experiences with them. Through their own active learning and work, they quickly became familiar with and accustomed to working on the train. Zheng Yukui and Sun Yizhi learned the operations work, which was originally planned to take three months, in just nineteen days. Sun Yizhi even dreamed of the train entering the station while sleeping, shouting out the call and response in her sleep, waking up the people sleeping next to her. With the help of leading cadres and their own efforts, they overcame the difficulties.
　　From April 25th last year, the female crew group officially undertook the service work of the twenty-first and twenty-second express trains between Beijing and Tianjin. In the past ten months, they have safely traveled more than 80,000 kilometers and completed more than 50,000 pieces of luggage without damage or loss. By the end of last year, they had received three awards and were selected as one of the eight model crews of the Beijing Train Section. Many passengers wrote enthusiastic and praiseworthy remarks in the suggestion book, and some passengers wrote letters to thank them for their care and praise their achievements. The female crew group has gradually expanded and become the cradle for training female attendants in the Beijing Train Section. They were originally eleven people, now they are fifteen; the original passenger conductor Yan Yuzhen has been promoted to deputy director of the Beijing Station Passenger Transport Office, and five others have been transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai direct train to work as broadcasters.
　　The female crew group has written a new page in the history of Chinese railways. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, wrote in the suggestion book on the train on May 10th last year:
　　"You are the pioneers opening up new occupations for Chinese women. I hope you will work hard and become a model crew on the national railways." (Attached picture)

　　京津铁路线上的女包乘组
　　晓晞
    往来京津路上二十一、二十二次对号特别快车，永远是那么令人满意。列车的设备非常好，人们走上三等车，瞧着那发亮的蒙着漆布的椅子的时候，都怀疑他们是否上错了车。但这不是主要的，最主要的是这个列车的女包乘组管理得好，得到了旅客们的赞许。
    人们踏上这个列车的乙字车厢的时候，便可看见穿着蓝布制服戴着红布袖章的正副女列车长。她们和蔼可亲地在忙着解答旅客们的各种问题。这个列车除司机、司炉外，穿着蓝布制服戴着红布袖章的客运车长、运转车长、列车员、行李员；背着短枪穿着草绿色军装的公安员；穿着白色工作服提着食品篮子的售货员；以及管理灯电的车电；检查机件的检车等，全都是有着极好的服务精神的女工作人员。
    尽管这个列车在北京，天津上下车的有一千多个旅客，乘务员总是耐心地打扫得干干净净。车箱是洁净的，车窗擦得极明亮，椅子，茶几几乎都是一尘不染，厕所里的抽水马桶擦洗得像脸盆一样干净，没有气味。每一节车厢里都有一个书箱，放着新近出版的画刊、杂志，让旅客随意挑选阅读。当旅客们一面翻阅着画刊、杂志，一面听着车上的广播节目的时候，他们是可能感觉到和在自己家里一样舒适的。难怪有的旅客想起过去在国民党反动派统治时代车内的混乱情形，在车上的意见簿里写着：“我坐了二十几年火车，今天第一次感觉到愉快。”
    最令人感动的，是女乘务员们对旅客的无微不至的照顾。她们经常地小心地照顾着年老的妇女和幼小儿童的上下车，她们说：“我们是把她们当作自己的母亲和孩子一样看待。”她们有时还帮着女旅客往行李架上抬行李；星期六、星期日人多的时候，她们宁肯自己不坐，把乘务员的休息室让给旅客们坐。对有特殊困难的旅客，她们更给予特殊照顾。有一次有一个患着心脏病的老太太，在车上不能坐，她们便让她躺在车长室里，下车的时候还搀着她送她出站，给她雇车。这个老太太病好了，第二次又来坐车的时候，她笑眯眯地对乘务员说：“你们看我胖了吧，我真愿意坐你们的车。”许多旅客在下车的时候，都热情地把自己的住址告诉乘务员们，他们说：“有功夫来我家玩吧”，或者说：“我下次再来坐你们的车”。
    去年“三八”节，在大连出现了中国第一批火车女驾驶人员的时候，紧接着天津铁路管理局北京列车段也出现了中国第一个管理列车乘务工作的女包乘组。当时天津铁路管理局下决心要开始培养一批女乘务人员，号召妇女加紧学习技术，熟悉业务。在党和青年团的鼓舞下，在田桂英学习驾驶火车成功的影响下，当时就有五十多妇女报名参加。但是她们中间大部分人因为身体不好，或有孩子牵累，只有严玉珍、黄清美、郑玉葵、孙以智等十一人被批准参加。这样就在天津铁路管理局出现了一件大事，过去被人们认为只能作些抄抄写写的工作，只能守在电话机旁作个接线生的女工作人员，现在居然也能学习管理列车了。有些人心里是有疑问的，他们说：“火车像个老虎，老虎吃人有个饱，火车吃人没个饱，男人待上去还有三分危险，女人能行吗？”因此，有的人就对妇女包乘组的同志说：“列车上有什么好，你看待在这大办公室里，又有大桌子大玻璃板的，这多舒服。”又有人说：“什么叫乘务工作，倒痰盂，擦车板，就叫乘务工作。”但是她们回答得很坚决，她们说：男人能干什么，我们也能干什么；我们不是到列车上去享福，我们不怕吃苦。”她们宣誓要坚决完成党和行政给予的任务。
    去年四月五日，妇女包乘组热烈地被欢迎到天津列车段实习。乘务工作并不像某些人想像的那么简单。一列车人的生命安全，乘务人员要负责任。列车开动起来，的确比老虎还厉害。当时发生了许多困难。领导干部知道后，立刻派了一个男同志随车指导工作，又在列车段上邀请模范包乘组的老大哥们和她们座谈经验，经过她们自己的积极学习和工作，很快就熟悉和习惯车上工作了。原计划要三个月才能学会的运转工作，郑玉葵和孙以智十九天就学会了。孙以智在睡觉的时候还梦见列车进站，在睡梦里喊起呼唤答应，把睡在她旁边的人都叫醒了。她们在领导干部的帮助和自己的努力下，把困难征服了。
    从去年四月二十五日起，妇女包乘组到北京列车段正式担任京津间二十一、二十二次特别快车的乘务工作，十个月来，已经安全行走八万多公里，完成五万多件行李无破损丢失责任事故。到去年年底止，已经受过三次奖励，并被评选为北京列车段八个模范包乘组之一。许多旅客都在意见簿上写着充满热情的赞美的辞句，还有一部分旅客写信来感谢她们的照顾和表扬她们的成绩。妇女包乘组已经逐渐扩大，成为北京列车段培养女乘务人员的摇篮。她们原来是十一个人，现在是十五个人；原来的客运车长严玉珍已提升为北京站客运室副主任，还有五个人调往京沪直达列车担任播音工作。
    妇女包乘组，在中国铁路史上写下了新的一页。全国总工会副主席李立三去年五月十日在车上的意见簿里写着：
    “你们是替中国妇女开辟新职业的开路先锋。希望你们努力，成为全国铁路上的模范乘务组。”（附图片）
