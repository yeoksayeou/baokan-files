　　CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Department's Preliminary Opinions on Establishing a Propaganda Network

　　Editor's Note: The preliminary opinions of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Department on establishing a propaganda network in the city, dated February 1st, are worth referring to by other regions.

　　I. Whether the work of establishing a propaganda network can proceed smoothly depends first and foremost on whether Party committees at all levels recognize its importance ideologically. Therefore, before establishing a propaganda network, it is necessary to make district committees and branch committees deeply understand the importance of ideological leadership through work summaries, understand that propaganda work must become a regular task for all Communist Party members, establish a working system for the propaganda network, and have the systematic leadership and management of Party committees at all levels. Only in this way can we overcome the simplistic administrative command style in various tasks, encourage the broad masses to support the Party's propositions, and follow the Party to advance together. The above points should also be thoroughly discussed by the branch committee members. After understanding them, a wide-ranging discussion should be launched among all Party members, Youth League members, and other revolutionary activists based on specific examples so that everyone feels the importance of propaganda work and recognizes that serving as a Party propagandist is a glorious responsibility.

　　II. To establish the Party's propaganda network for the people in this city means to establish Party reporters at the municipal and district levels. The municipal and district Party committees will uniformly assign them to various people's gatherings and representative meetings to deliver political reports. Party propagandists will be established in each Party branch and other units such as factories, government offices, and schools to regularly conduct simple and popular propaganda to the masses in their units and frequently reflect the demands and opinions of the people around them to the Party organization to strengthen the Party's ties with the people. For various forms of mass propaganda teams in each factory, government office, school, etc., the role of the propagandist backbone should be used to coordinate them with the Party's propaganda work, and expand the results of propaganda work.

　　III. The method of selecting propagandists should generally involve summarizing the work of the previous stage (currently focusing on the summary of the anti-American and aid-Korea work in the previous period), explaining the importance of propaganda work and the significance of establishing the Party's propaganda network for the people to Party members, Youth League members, and revolutionary activists. Through democratic discussions or other appropriate means, propose Party members, Youth League members, and labor models, veteran workers, skilled workers, and other revolutionary activists around the branch who have been proven to have the necessary political consciousness, lead by example in production labor and other work, maintain contact with the masses, and have the appropriate ability to serve as propagandists as preliminary nominations for propagandists in the unit. Preliminary nominations must be reviewed and approved by the Party branch committee and the district committee before they are officially determined to be propagandists. Generally speaking, each branch secretary, branch committee member of the Party and the Youth League, and Party members and Youth League members who have regular working contacts with the people (such as trade union cadres, cooperative cadres, wall newspaper editors, entertainment committee members, etc.) should serve as propagandists.

　　IV. After the list of propagandists is officially determined after approval by the district committee, the branch committee should assign the regular scope of activities for each propagandist based on the actual situation of the unit, the original positions of each propagandist, and their relationships with the surrounding masses. Gradually strive to assign a relatively fixed propagandist for every twenty to thirty people; in the various propaganda positions of the unit (entertainment department, wall newspaper, trade union cultural and entertainment department, broadcasting station, radio group, etc.), there should be one or more propagandists who regularly play a backbone role. This list of propagandists (preferably including their scope of work) should be publicly announced among the masses, and the date of the higher-level Party organization's approval of the list of propagandists and the glorious responsibilities of the propagandists should be announced. In order to make the propagandists realize their important mission, resolutely implement the glorious tasks given by the Party, and be willing to become assistants to the Party in carrying out political work among the masses under the supervision of the masses. At the same time, it can also enable the broad masses to understand its significance, be willing to understand the Party's opinions and propositions through the Party's propagandists, and reflect the situation to the Party organization.

　　V. The activities of the propagandists should be directly led by the branch committee, and should not form an organization by themselves, nor should there be a vertical leadership system for the propagandist organization. The specific leadership of their activities should be the responsibility of the branch committee, which should discuss the specific tasks and methods of the propaganda work of the branch according to the instructions of the higher level and the situation of the branch, and then convene a meeting of all propagandists of the branch every week or every two weeks, giving the propagandists specific instructions on their work, and stipulating appropriate division of labor and close cooperation methods for the propaganda forces of various organizations (Party, government, trade union, Youth League, etc.) in the unit, so that all propagandists and various organizations can carry out their work under the unified deployment of the branch. If it is inconvenient to convene a meeting of propagandists, it can be changed to a meeting of propagandist representatives, that is, several propagandists of the same nature and closely related (such as the same workshop, the same wall newspaper) can send representatives to attend, but the number of such representative meetings per month should not exceed the number of general meetings, and the representatives should not be used as group leaders, so as to avoid too many levels and affect the close connection between the Party and the masses. The whole propagandist meeting or the representative meeting should be fully prepared in advance to be concise and focused, and the content of the meeting should be focused on. It is best to provide the propagandists with a propaganda outline or reference materials at the meeting.

　　VI. The propagandists should carry out their work according to the content stipulated by the propagandist meeting. The methods include: talking, speeches, conveying news, reading newspapers, broadcasting, quick reports, writing and drawing propaganda texts, pictures, forms, wall newspapers, convening meetings (forums, casual discussions, technical meetings, evening parties, etc.), propaganda signs, propaganda platforms, mobile red flags, honor books, honor lists, photos, cultural and entertainment activities, etc. They should use the above forms to regularly publicize domestic and international current affairs, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and the current tasks of the people to the people around them, commend labor models, combat heroes, and outstanding scientific and artistic workers among the people, spread their achievements and experiences, encourage the victorious advance of the people's revolutionary cause, and regularly reflect the demands and opinions of the people around them to the Party organization to strengthen the Party's ties with the people.

　　VII. The establishment of the propagandist system is to enable the Party to have a backbone that regularly plays a role in carrying out propaganda work to the people, and it is not to limit the Party's propaganda work to the scope of the propagandists (or plus the reporters). Therefore, in addition to paying attention to absorbing members of the existing mass propaganda teams who have the appropriate propagandist conditions as propagandists in the process of establishing the propaganda network, we should also (1) pay attention to caring for and cultivating gradually progressive elements in the existing mass propaganda teams who may become Party propagandists, so that the existing mass propaganda teams become the main source of Party propagandists. (2) Pay attention to consolidating and expanding the existing mass propaganda teams, and assisting in the creation of new mass propaganda teams. Party propagandists should be assigned to work in various mass propaganda teams (such as anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda groups, trade union wall newspaper committees, trade union broadcasting committees, drama troupes, harmonica teams, singing teams, newspaper reading groups, etc.), so that these mass activists who participate in various propaganda activities first understand the content of the Party's propaganda work, and express the content of the Party's propaganda in various forms through their activities. When necessary, the propagandist meeting can be expanded to invite activists in the mass propaganda teams to participate in order to act in a coordinated manner under a unified goal.

　　VIII. In each grass-roots unit, the propaganda activities of the Communist Youth League and other mass organizations should be uniformly led by the branch committee. The branch of the Communist Youth League should mobilize and select qualified members of the League to be Party propagandists and play the role of assistants to the Party's work; in addition to focusing on workers' spare-time education and workers' mass cultural and entertainment activities, the grass-roots organizations of trade unions should mobilize and select qualified outstanding trade union cadres and members to be Party propagandists and strengthen the Party's leadership in trade union cultural and educational work. Other mass organizations should also proceed according to this principle.

　　IX. Cultivating and selecting propagandists, consolidating and expanding existing propagandists are regular and important tasks of Party organizations at all levels, especially each branch. Attention should be paid to providing specific assistance to activists in the unit to gradually reach the conditions of propagandists and be selected as Party propagandists in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Higher-level Party organizations should help and educate propagandists in the following ways: (1) Absorb propagandists into Party training classes or night Party schools for study; (2) Provide propagandists with necessary materials, charts, and publications; (3) Convene special professional meetings or hold short-term professional training classes to discuss how to do propaganda work and exchange experiences; (4) Propagandists listen to the report of the district committee secretary at the district-wide propagandist conference; (5) The district committee convenes branch secretary meetings on a regular basis to discuss propaganda work methods and experience in organizing propagandists; (6) Party newspapers and periodicals regularly publish materials to help propagandists, exchange experiences, and introduce typical examples; (7) Require the city's People's Broadcasting Station to broadcast a program specifically designed for propagandist work once or twice a week; (8) Supervise and help propagandists study Marxism-Leninism and newspapers and periodicals.

　　X. In units where there is currently no Party branch, when establishing a propaganda network, we should first conduct propaganda on establishing a propaganda network among League members and the masses through the Communist Youth League or mass organizations such as trade unions. After nominations are made at the meetings of the League branch or mass organizations, the district committee will review and approve the establishment of Party propagandists in the unit. These propagandists should be directly controlled by the district committee and carefully select and dispatch appropriate Party members to be the leaders of the propagandists in the unit. The leaders should lead the propaganda work of the unit through propagandist representative meetings or other appropriate forms.

　　XI. The work of establishing a propaganda network in neighborhoods should be carried out after the work of establishing a propaganda network in the organized masses in the district is basically completed. Generally, it should first be piloted in neighborhoods with a good mass base, and a combination of organ branches and neighborhood activists can be adopted. Because there are more Party members and League members in organs and their political level is higher, if they are combined with neighborhood activists, the neighborhood propaganda work can have a backbone. When carrying out this work, the district committee can first convene a meeting of organ branch propagandists in the district and absorb neighborhood activists to participate, divide the propaganda areas and propaganda objects, and arrange propaganda tasks.

　　XII. The Party's propaganda work must be given systematic leadership and management by Party committees at all levels. The propaganda department (propaganda committee member) of each Party committee should be clearly defined as a working department (division of labor) of the Party committee, and under the leadership of the Party committee, conduct daily work inspection, collect information, prepare materials, solve business problems, etc. When necessary, they can also prepare various propaganda work meetings convened by the Party committee responsible for preparing the central decision according to the instructions of the Party committee secretary, but the chair and content of the meeting must still be the responsibility of the Party committee.

　　中共上海市委宣传部关于建立宣传网工作的初步意见
    编者按：中共上海市委宣传部二月一日对该市建立宣传网的初步意见，值得各地参考。
    一、建立宣传网工作能否顺利进行，首先决定于各级党委是否在思想上认识其重要。因此，在建立宣传网以前，必须通过工作总结，使区委及支委同志均能深刻了解思想领导的重要性，了解必须使宣传工作成为全体共产党员的经常性工作、建立宣传网的工作制度，并由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理，才能克服各项工作中的简单行政命令作风，鼓舞广大群众拥护党的主张并跟着党一同前进。以上要点，并应在支部委员深入讨论搞通以后，根据具体事例，在全体党员、团员及其他革命积极分子中展开广泛讨论，使人人感到宣传工作的重要、认识担任党的宣传员是光荣的责任。
    二、在本市建立党对人民群众的宣传网，就是要在市、区两级建立党的报告员，由市、区两级党委统一分配到各种人民群众的集会和代表会议去作政治报告。在党的每个支部及其他工厂、机关、学校……等单位中建立党的宣传员，经常向本单位的群众进行简单通俗的宣传，并经常将自己周围人民群众的要求与意见反映给党的组织，以加强党与人民群众的联系。对于每个工厂、机关、学校……等单位中各种形式的群众性的宣传队伍，应经常通过宣传员的骨干作用，使其与党的宣传工作协同一致，扩大宣传工作的成果。
    三、选拔宣传员的方法，一般应经过前一阶段工作的总结（目前应以前一时期抗美援朝工作的总结为主），向党团员、革命积极分子说明宣传工作的重要性及建立党对人民群众宣传网的意义。经过民主讨论或其他适当方式提出经过工作考验证明确是具有必要的政治觉悟、在生产劳动和其他工作中以身作则、联系群众、并有担任宣传工作的适当能力的党员、青年团员及支部周围愿意在党领导下担任宣传工作的劳动模范、老工人、技术工人和其他革命积极分子，作为本单位宣传员的初步提名。初步提名必须经过党的支部委员会审查通过、区委批准，才正式确定其为宣传员。一般地说，党和青年团的每个支部书记、支部委员和与人民群众有经常工作联系的党员和青年团员（例如工会干部、合作社干部、墙报编辑、文娱委员等），都应担任宣传员。
    四、宣传员名单经过区委批准正式确定后，即应由支部委员会根据本单位的实际情况就各宣传员的原有岗位及其周围群众关系，分配各宣传员的经常活动范围，逐步争取在每二十——三十个群众中，能分配到一个较固定的宣传员；在本单位各种宣传阵地上（娱乐部、墙报、工会文化娱乐部门、广播台、收音组等），均能有一个以上的宣传员经常起骨干作用。此项宣传员名单（最好连同其工作范围）应在群众中公开宣布，并宣布上级党组织批准宣传员名单的日期及宣传员的光荣职责。以使宣传员认识自己的重大使命，坚决贯彻党所给予的光荣任务，并愿意在群众监督之下，真正成为党在群众中进行政治工作的助手。同时，也可使广大群众了解其意义、愿意经过党的宣传员了解党的意见主张及反映情况给党的组织。
    五、宣传员的活动应由支部委员会直接领导，本身不形成组织，也不应有宣传员组织的垂直领导系统。其具体活动的领导，应由支部委员会根据上级指示和本支部的情况，讨论本支部宣传工作的具体任务和方法，然后每周或每两周召集本支部的全体宣传员会议，给宣传员以工作的具体指示，并规定本单位内各种组织（党、政、工、团等）的宣传力量的适当分工和密切配合的办法，使全体宣传员以及各种组织都能在支部的统一部署下进行工作。如宣传员会议召集不便时，可改为宣传员代表会议，即各种性质相同而又密切联系之数个宣传员（如同一车间、同一墙报），可以推派代表出席，但每月此种代表会议的次数不应超过全体会议的次数，也不要把代表作为小组长使用，以免层次繁多，影响到党与群众的密切联系。全体宣传员会议或代表会议，应事先充分准备力求精悍，会议内容要有重点。会议上最好发给宣传员以宣传提纲或参考材料。
    六、宣传员应根据宣传员会议规定的内容进行工作。其方法包括：谈话、演说、传递消息、读报、广播、快报、书写和绘制宣传文字图画表格、墙报、召集会议（座谈会、漫谈讨论会、技术会议、晚会……等）、宣传牌、宣传台、流动红旗、光荣册、光荣榜、照片、文娱活动等。应通过以上各种形式经常向自己周围人民群众宣传国内外时事、党和人民政府的政策、人民当前的任务，表扬人民群众中的劳动模范、战斗英雄以及优秀的科学艺术工作者，传播他们的成就和经验，鼓舞人民革命事业的胜利前进，并经常将自己周围人民群众中的要求和意见反映给党的组织，以加强党与人民群众的联系。
    七、建立宣传员的制度，是为了使党向人民群众进行宣传工作得到经常起作用的骨干，并不是要把党的宣传工作仅仅限制于宣传员（或加上报告员）的范围之内。因此，除了在建立宣传网过程中要注意吸收现有群众性宣传队伍中具有适当宣传员条件的分子为宣传员外，并应（一）注意关心培养现有群众性宣传队伍中逐渐进步可能成为党的宣传员的分子，使现有群众性宣传队伍成为党的宣传员的主要来源。（二）注意巩固并扩大现有的群众性宣传队伍，协助新的群众性宣传队伍的产生。应当分配党的宣传员在各种群众性宣传队伍（如抗美援朝宣传小组、工会墙报委员会、工会广播委员会、剧团、口琴队、歌咏队、读报组等）之中工作，使这些参加各种宣传活动的群众积极分子首先了解党的宣传工作内容，并通过他们的活动以各种形式把党的宣传内容表达出来。必要时，宣传员会议并可扩大举行，召集群众性宣传队伍中的积极分子参加，以便在统一的目标下协同一致地动作。
    八、在各基层单位中应由支部委员会统一领导青年团及其他群众团体的宣传活动。青年团的支部应动员选拔合乎条件的团员为党的宣传员，发挥党的工作的助手作用；工会的基层组织除了以工人业余教育及工人群众文化娱乐活动为重点外，应动员选拔合乎条件的优秀工会干部及会员为党的宣传员，加强党对工会文教工作中的领导作用。其他群众团体，也应按此原则进行。
    九、培养与选拔宣传员，巩固与扩大现有宣传员，乃是各级党的组织，特别是各支部的经常重要任务之一。应注意对本单位中的积极分子，进行具体帮助，使其逐步达到宣传员的条件，按规定手续选拔为党的宣传员。上级党的组织，应以如下方法进行帮助教育宣传员的工作：（一）吸收宣传员进入党训班或夜党校学习；（二）供给宣传员需要的材料图表与出版物；（三）召集专门业务性会议，或举办短期业务训练班，讨论如何作宣传工作，交流经验；（四）宣传员在全区宣传员大会上听取区委书记的报告；（五）区委按期召开支部书记会议，讨论宣传工作方法及组织宣传员的经验；（六）党报党刊经常刊载帮助宣传员的材料，交流经验，介绍典型实例；（七）责成本市人民广播电台每周广播一二次专为宣传员工作而设的节目；（八）督促帮助宣传员学习马列主义与报纸刊物。
    十、在目前尚无党的支部的单位，建立宣传网时应先通过青年团或工会等群众组织，在团内及群众中进行建立宣传网的宣传，经团的支部或群众组织的会议中提名，由区委审查批准建立该单位的党的宣传员。这些宣传员应由区委直接掌握并慎重选派适当的党员为该单位宣传员的领导人，由该领导人经过宣传员代表会议或其他适当形式去领导这一单位的宣传工作。
    十一、里弄中的建立宣传网工作，应在本区有组织群众中建立宣传网工作基本完成以后，一般应先在群众基础较好之里弄中先行试办，并可以采用机关支部和里弄积极分子相结合之办法。因为机关中党团员较多，政治水平较高，如与里弄积极分子结合，即可使里弄宣传工作有了骨干，区委在进行此项工作时，可先召开本区机关支部宣传员会议，并吸收里弄积极分子参加，划分宣传地区与宣传对象，布置宣传任务。
    十二、党的宣传工作，必须由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理。各党委的宣传部（宣传委员），应明确为党委的一个工作部门（业务分工），在党委的领导下，进行日常工作检查、收集情况、准备材料、解决业务问题等，必要时并可根据党委书记指示准备中央决定中规定的各种党委负责召集的宣传工作会议，但会议的主持与会议内容必须仍由党委负责。
