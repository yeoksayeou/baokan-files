Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: According to TASS, Pravda published an editorial on the 18th entitled "The Great Holiday of the Soviet People," discussing the elections to the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics. It stated: The Soviet people welcome Comrade Stalin's interview with Pravda's reporter with infinite satisfaction and exceptional enthusiasm. Stalin's speech contains a profound scientific analysis of the current international situation, upon which the Soviet Union's policy of peace is based. His speech exposed the sinister schemes of the imperialist warmongers and outlined a program for further struggle for peace throughout the world.

The editorial pointed out: Under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people are victoriously implementing Stalin's plan for building communism. While capitalist countries are frantically expanding armaments, shrinking peaceful industries, increasing taxes, and skyrocketing prices, all the efforts of the Soviet Union are for peaceful construction and for further improving the people's welfare. Stalin's peace policy represents the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and has won the warm support of all peace-loving peoples who oppose the US-British ruling bloc's policy of launching a new world war.

The editorial continued: The Soviet people are working calmly and confidently. The bright and magnificent prospects of communist construction have given them great strength. The Party of Lenin and Stalin inspires and organizes peaceful construction, leading the Soviet people to strive for the victory of communism.

The editorial emphasized: The candidates nominated by the Stalinist Party and the non-Party bloc are the cream of the Soviet people. All their activities for the happiness of the people are guided by the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. The nomination of Comrade Stalin by the Soviet people as the first candidate to the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics demonstrates the Soviet people's warm love and boundless loyalty to our beloved Stalin, who leads our motherland from victory to victory. The elections to the Supreme Soviets once again demonstrate the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people and their close unity around the Party of Lenin and Stalin.
