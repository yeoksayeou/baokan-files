　　Compulsory Insurance Must Be Implemented
    The State Council promulgated on February 3rd the decision on implementing compulsory property insurance for state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives, and compulsory passenger insurance. This is an important measure to further strengthen the protection of state property, prevent unexpected disasters, promote economic accounting in enterprises, and accumulate construction funds for the country. Since the Central Financial and Economic Commission issued instructions on November 23, 1949, that state-owned enterprises must have insurance, the state insurance business has begun to expand on a larger scale across the country. This decision by the State Council will consolidate and expand the people's insurance business. The State Council's decision clearly stipulates the content of compulsory insurance, which should include property and transportation insurance for state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives, as well as transportation vehicle insurance for railway vehicles, automobiles, and ships, and the implementation of compulsory insurance for passengers on trains, ships, and airplanes. This decision is fully adapted to the needs of the national economic situation in 1951. The general national economic situation in 1951 is that material exchanges between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign countries will be unprecedentedly active, and the transportation and industrial and agricultural production will be vigorously improved. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to expand and strengthen the national insurance business in a timely manner to reduce unexpected disasters, ensure the safety of state property, guarantee the smooth implementation of national production and trade plans, and at the same time strive to gradually accumulate funds in the insurance business for the country's restoration and construction work.
    The benefits of insurance are very obvious. Under the current conditions, many enterprises can only try to avoid unexpected disasters as much as possible and have not been able to completely overcome them. Therefore, many units often allocate some funds themselves to prevent the occurrence of disasters. However, if disaster prevention work is carried out in a decentralized manner and disaster prevention funds are kept in a decentralized manner, it is difficult to carry out effective disaster prevention in advance or effective remedies afterward due to the dispersion of power. The compulsory insurance system now implemented is stipulated by national laws, with the People's Insurance Company of China as the insurance agency for state property, responsible for centralizing disaster prevention funds, unifying the organization and guidance of national disaster prevention work, and promptly remedying the losses caused by disasters. After the property of each unit is insured, its disaster prevention work will receive full assistance and guidance from the People's Insurance Company of China. The People's Insurance Company of China can conscientiously promote the disaster prevention work of each unit by checking the disaster prevention equipment of each unit. The insurance company can also propose part of the insurance premium to improve urban public fire-fighting equipment and traffic safety equipment to reduce the possibility of disasters. In the event of an unexpected disaster, the insurance company will quickly compensate, so that production will not be interrupted, and the original plan will not be unfulfilled. If each unit turns the inestimable reserves for preventing accidental losses into fixed insurance premiums for expenditure, it will be able to calculate costs more accurately, and the entire financial plan of the unit will not be bankrupted due to the occurrence of unexpected disasters.
    The idea of opposing insurance must be corrected. Some units have the wrong idea of "anyway, the public will compensate," and think that it does not matter whether they have insurance or not. This is a supply system thinking on the issue of funds. Other units unilaterally emphasize the so-called "reduction of costs" and demand not to have insurance or to have less insurance. This is a short-sighted view. The former idea believes that if a disaster occurs, whether the finance allocates funds, the insurance company pays compensation, or the enterprise finds its own way, the public will pay the money anyway, so why must there be insurance. In fact, the effects are completely different due to the different methods of compensating for disasters. After the national finance gradually tends to be planned, after the occurrence of unexpected disasters, it should no longer rely on financial allocations for reconstruction, otherwise it will disrupt the national financial budget. If the enterprise finds its own way, it will temporarily suspend the production plan and break the original economic accounting of the enterprise, even in the event of a minor disaster. If the disaster is serious, the enterprise itself will not be able to recover on its own for a while. In this way, the loss of state property will be unrecoverable. Only when the insurance company is responsible for compensation can the recovery of the disaster-stricken business not be affected. The view of some enterprises that compulsory insurance is an increase in costs is also incorrect. In fact, the cost that does not include insurance expenses is not a correct cost, but a lucky cost, which, like the cost that has not been depreciated, is neither true nor correct. Moreover, after the implementation of compulsory insurance, due to the expansion of the insurance coverage and the dispersion of the burden of risk, the insurance premium rate will inevitably be reduced, so the impact of the so-called "increase in costs" will gradually decrease.
    The significance of compulsory passenger insurance is, on the one hand, to pay more attention to the safety of passengers' lives, and on the other hand, to ensure the economic accounting of the transportation enterprises themselves. In fact, it is a way to mobilize passengers to collectively organize disaster prevention. Because each passenger only provides a small insurance premium, the insurance company concentrates its resources to assist in improving traffic safety equipment, and is responsible for checking and urging transportation agencies to effectively improve traffic safety work, which can reduce unexpected disasters for passengers. In the event of a disaster, funds can be quickly allocated for medical relief and to compensate for unexpected losses to passengers.
    According to the Soviet experience, compulsory insurance not only has the above-mentioned functions, but is also an important means of accumulating funds to consolidate and expand socialist reproduction. During the period of national economic recovery in the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1925, Lenin signed the decree of the People's Committee on state property insurance and implemented compulsory insurance. Before the Second World War, compulsory insurance, in addition to including the property of state-owned enterprises and agencies, also included the property insurance of 236,000 collective farms and 26.4 million collective farmers, insuring 100 million head of livestock, 1.2 trillion square meters of crops, and insured property of 202 billion rubles. The accumulated funds averaged 4 billion rubles per year. These rubles were contributed to the state by the State Insurance Bureau in the form of purchasing public bonds as funds for socialist construction.
    Of course, in new democratic countries, compulsory insurance cannot be implemented uniformly for public and private units. The insurance business in new democratic countries should be the coexistence of compulsory insurance and voluntary insurance. On the one hand, compulsory insurance should be implemented for state-owned enterprises and state organs that are socialist economic components, and cooperatives that are semi-socialist economic components; on the other hand, voluntary insurance should be actively developed in rural and urban areas. Rural voluntary insurance is mainly cattle insurance, crop insurance, and fire insurance, which are important methods to protect the lives of farmers and reduce disasters for farmers. Rural voluntary insurance will gradually replace the relief system. The cattle insurance and crop insurance that the People's Insurance Company trialed in various places last year were very popular among farmers, proving that it is entirely possible to promote voluntary insurance to farmers. The promotion of voluntary insurance in cities is mainly fire insurance and transportation insurance, with the aim of ensuring the safety of industry and commerce. As for personal property insurance and life insurance, they contain the meaning of collective disaster prevention and the promotion of savings, and should also be gradually promoted. The combined promotion of compulsory insurance and voluntary insurance will promote the safety and development of the five economic components in the new democratic society.
    The insurance business in the People's Republic of China has undergone great changes in the past year. The original situation in which imperialism controlled 75 percent of China's insurance business has changed to a situation in which state insurance companies account for more than 70 percent, and if private insurance companies are included, they account for a total of 81 percent. Foreign insurance companies now account for only 19 percent. Under the leadership and assistance of the People's Bank of China, the People's Insurance Company of China has established institutions and agencies throughout the country, laying a preliminary foundation for carrying out national business. After the implementation of compulsory insurance, the national insurance business will surely achieve significant progress. The People's Insurance Company of China must strengthen its work, first do a good job in underwriting and disaster prevention, vigorously assist in urban fire protection, and strive to supervise and improve traffic safety, so as to reduce the occurrence of disasters.
    Compulsory insurance is a new issue in our country. The insurance business is a business that has significant benefits for the national economy and the people's lives. Leaders at all levels must pay serious attention to ensuring the implementation of insurance laws and regulations.

### 必须实行强制保险

　　必须实行强制保险
    政务院二月三日颁布了关于实行国家机关、国营企业、合作社财产强制保险及旅客强制保险的决定，这是进一步加强保护国家财产，防止意外灾害，推动企业经济核算，并为国家积累建设资金的重要措施。从一九四九年十一月二十三日中央财政经济委员会颁发了国营企业必须保险的指示以后，国家保险事业已开始以较大规模向全国开展。政务院这个决定，则将巩固与扩大人民保险事业。政务院决定明确规定了强制保险的内容，应包括国家机关、国营企业、合作社的财产保险与运输保险，以及铁路车辆、汽车、船舶的运输工具保险，并开始实施火车、轮船及飞机三种乘客强制保险。这个决定是完全适应于一九五一年的国家经济情况的需要的。一九五一年的国家经济总情况是：城乡和内外物资交流将空前活跃，交通运输事业及工业农业生产均将努力提高，因此，及时扩大与加强国家保险事业，以减少意外灾害，保障国家财产安全，保证国家生产和贸易计划的顺利进行，同时在保险事业中争取逐渐积累资金，为国家进行恢复与建设工作之用，是完全必要的。
    保险的利益是很显然的，在目前条件下，许多企业对于意外灾害，仅能尽量避免，尚未能完全克服，因此许多单位为防患未然，往往自拨部分基金，以防备灾害的发生。但是，防灾工作如果分散进行，防险基金如果分散保管，则因力量分散，既难能于事前进行有效的防灾，也难于事后进行有效的补救。现在所实行的强制保险制度，则是由国家法令规定，由中国人民保险公司为国家财产的保险机关，负责集中防险基金，统一组织与指导国家的防灾工作，并及时补救灾害所造成的损失。各单位的财产实行保险以后，其防灾工作将获得中国人民保险公司的充分协助与指导。中国人民保险公司则通过检查各单位防灾设备的方法，可以认真推动各单位的防灾工作。保险公司并可以提出部分保险费，以改善城市公共消防设备与交通的安全设备，以减少灾害发生的可能。如遇有意外灾害，则由保险公司迅速赔偿，使生产不致中断，使原来计划不致不能完成。各单位如将防备意外损失的不易估量的准备金，化为固定的保险费来支出，也就能够较为精确地核算成本，不致于因为发生了意外灾害，使该单位全部财务计划为之破产。
    反对保险的思想是必须纠正的。若干单位存在着“反正公家赔”的错误思想，认为保险不保险根本没有关系。这是一种资金问题上的供给制思想。另有些单位则片面地强调所谓“减低成本”，要求不保险或少保险，这是一种近视观点。前一种思想认为，如果发生了灾害，无论由财政拨款，由保险公司赔款，或由企业自行设法，反正都是公家出钱，何必一定要保险。实际上由于弥补灾害的方法不同，其效果完全两样。国家财政逐渐趋于计划化之后，意外灾害发生之后，不应当再仰赖于财政拨款来重新修建，否则将破坏国家财政预算。如果由企业自行设法，则在灾害较小的情况下，亦将使生产计划暂行停顿，打破了企业原来的经济核算。如果灾害严重，则企业本身一时无法自力恢复，这样，国家财产的损失，势将无法弥补。只有由保险公司负责赔偿，才不致影响受灾事业的恢复。若干企业认为强制保险是增加成本的观点，也是不对的。其实，不包括保险费支出的成本，决不是正确的成本，而是侥幸的成本，与未曾折旧的成本一样，既不真实也不正确。而且强制保险推行以后，由于保险面的扩大，危险负担面的分散，保险费率就必然减低，因之所谓“增加成本”的影响亦将逐渐减少。
    旅客强制保险的意义，一方面是更加注意旅客生命的安全，一方面也是保证交通企业本身的经济核算，事实上是发动旅客集体组织防灾的一种方式。因为每一个旅客只提供很少的保险费，而保险公司则集中资力协助改善交通安全设备，并负责检查与督促交通机关切实改进交通安全工作，这就可以减少旅客意外的灾害。万一灾害发生，则可以迅速拨款进行医疗救济，弥补旅客意外损失。
    根据苏联的经验，强制保险不仅有上述作用，而且是积累资金，以巩固与扩大社会主义再生产的重要手段。苏联于一九二一年至一九二五年国民经济恢复时期，列宁曾签署了人民委员会关于国家财产保险的法令，实行了强制保险。在第二次世界大战以前，强制保险除包括国家企业机关财产外，尚包括二十三万六千个集体农场和二千六百四十万集体农民的财产保险，承保牲畜一万万头，农作物一万二千亿平方米，保险财产达二千○二十亿卢布，累计资金平均每年四十亿卢布，这些卢布，由国家保险局以购买公债的方式，贡献给国家作为进行社会主义建设的资金。
    当然，在新民主主义国家中，不能对公私单位一律实行强制保险。新民主主义国家保险事业，应当是强制保险与自愿保险同时存在。一方面是对于社会主义经济成份的国营企业和国家机关，和半社会主义经济成份的合作社，实施强制保险；另一方面在农村及城市积极开展自愿保险。农村自愿保险主要是耕牛险、作物险、火险，是保障农民生活，减少农民灾害的重要方法。农村自愿保险，将逐渐代替救济制度。人民保险公司去年在各地方试行的耕牛保险、农作物保险，大受农民欢迎，证明对农民推行自愿保险是完全可能的。城市推行自愿保险，主要是火险、运输险，目的在于保障工商业的安全。至于个人的财产保险及人寿保险，则包含有集体防灾与推行储蓄的意义，亦应逐渐加以推行。强制保险与自愿保险结合推行，将促进新民主主义社会中五种经济成份的安全与发展。
    中华人民共和国的保险事业一年来已经有很大的变化。原来由帝国主义控制中国保险事业百分之七十五的情况，已经变为国家保险公司占百分之七十以上的情况，如果连同私营保险公司则共占去了百分之八十一。外商保险业现在仅占百分之十九了。中国人民保险公司在中国人民银行领导与扶助下，在全国已经普设机构及代理处所，初步地奠定了开展全国业务的基础。实行强制保险后，国家保险事业必将获得重大的进展。中国人民保险公司必须加强工作，首先作好承保工作与防灾工作，对都市消防应大力协助，对交通安全应努力督促改进，以减少灾害的发生。
    强制保险，在我们国家中是一个新问题。保险事业是对国家经济和人民生活均有重大利益的事业。各级领导机关，必须认真注意保证保险法令的贯彻。
