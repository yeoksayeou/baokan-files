Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: The 1951 National Forestry Conference opened today. The purpose of this conference is to summarize the experience of the national forestry work in 1950, and to discuss issues related to forest protection, afforestation, rational logging and utilization of forests and timber, and unified timber production.

　　Liang Xi, Minister of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, first reported to the conference on the "Summary of Forestry Work in 1950 and Forestry Plan for 1951" at the opening ceremony.

　　In the past year, the national forestry work has made great progress in all aspects such as forest protection, afforestation, mountain closure for afforestation, forest logging and utilization, and surveys. According to incomplete statistics: in the past year, only during the spring and rainy seasons, a total of 446 million trees were planted nationwide, exceeding the original plan of 406 million trees. In terms of closing hillsides for afforestation, according to statistics from 17 provinces, more than 3.28 million mu of hillside closure has been completed last year. The two major forest logging areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia completed their annual logging task of more than 4.5 million cubic meters by early March last year. Due to the adoption of the Soviet Union’s advanced rational logging experience in the Northeast region, the entire region saved approximately 300,000 cubic meters of timber compared to 1949. Due to the promotion of the Central and local people's governments, forest protection work has begun to receive widespread attention from party and government cadres and people in forest areas. The national forest survey work has begun preliminarily. In addition, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government has also consulted with relevant parties to decide on a plan to train forestry technical cadres.

　　Although the forestry work achieved the above results last year, there are still shortcomings. First of all, in terms of forest protection, a total of 2,700 forest fires occurred nationwide last year, resulting in a loss of 2.6 million cubic meters of forest, and fire losses accounted for 98 percent of the total forest losses. Therefore, how to prevent forest fires is very important. Secondly, some areas did not pay enough attention to key large-scale afforestation in their afforestation work last year, so the effect on eliminating barren mountains and sandy land was not significant; some places set plans too high and lacked technical guidance, resulting in plan failure or losses. The forest logging plan was not reasonable enough, and the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging was still quite serious. There was also a lot of waste in the use of timber. The above issues will be emphasized in this conference for discussion and resolution, so as to improve our country's forestry work a step further.

　　More than 120 representatives and guests attended the conference, including forestry administrative and technical cadres, forestry educators from major administrative regions and provinces across the country, and representatives from relevant central departments.

### 全国林业会议开幕

　　全国林业会议开幕
    【新华社十四日讯】一九五一年全国林业会议今日开幕。此次会议的目的是总结一九五○年全国林业工作的经验，并讨论有关护林、造林和林木的合理采伐、合理使用，与木材的统一生产等问题。
    中央人民政府林垦部部长梁希在大会开幕式上首先向大会报告了“一九五○年林业工作总结和一九五一年的林业计划”。
    去年一年来，全国林业工作无论在护林、造林、封山育林以及森林的采伐利用和调查等各方面都有很大的进步。根据不完全统计：去年全国仅春季和雨季两季植树即达四亿四千六百万株，超过了原计划四亿零六百万株的任务。在封山育林方面，据十七个省的统计，去年已完成封山面积三百二十八万多亩。东北和内蒙两个主要森林采伐区在去年三月上旬即已完成了当年四百五十多万立方米的采伐任务。东北区由于接受了苏联先进的合理采伐经验，全区较一九四九年共节省了约三十万立方米的木材。由于中央及各级人民政府的提倡，护林工作已开始受到各地党政干部和林区人民的普遍注意。全国的森林调查工作已初步开始。此外，中央人民政府林垦部并曾与有关方面洽商决定有计划地训练林业技术干部。
    去年林业工作虽有以上成绩，但仍存在缺点。首先是护林方面，去年全国森林共发生火灾二千七百次，损失林木达二百六十万立方公尺，火灾损失占全部森林损失量的百分之九十八。因此，如何防止森林火灾十分重要。其次，去年有些地区的造林工作对重点的成片造林不够重视，因而对消灭山荒、沙荒的作用不大；有的地方计划订得过高，技术指导差，因而计划落空或造成损失。在森林的采伐计划上也不够合理、滥伐林木现象仍相当严重，对木材的使用上存在许多浪费。以上问题都将在这次会议上着重提出讨论并加以解决，以使我国的林业工作更提高一步。
    出席这次会议的有全国各大行政区、各省的林业行政和技术干部、林业教育工作者与中央有关部门的代表和来宾共一百二十多人。
