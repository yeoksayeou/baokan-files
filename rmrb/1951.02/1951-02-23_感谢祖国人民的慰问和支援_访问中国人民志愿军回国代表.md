　　Thanking the Motherland's People for Their Solicitations and Support
    —An Interview with Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning to China
    Lin Hong
    In the residence of the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there were many silk banners inscribed with "Defenders of World Peace," "Steel Bones and Iron Muscles," and "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Gaining Glory for the Country," countless bouquets of bright flowers, and more than one hundred various colored school badges and commemorative medals presented by students and Young Pioneers. When the Volunteer Army representatives spoke of how much the people of the motherland loved them, they all excitedly said: This is the glory of the Volunteer Army comrades, and also the glory of the people of the motherland!
    The Volunteer Army representatives, headed by Chai Chuanruo, had come from the front lines of the Han River. One of the representatives, Dong Lefu, had participated in the battle on the Eastern Front. He said: Without the millions of Chinese and Korean people braving enemy aircraft's bombing and strafing, crossing mountains and ridges to transport ammunition and supplies, our Volunteer Army would be unable to fight. We received a large amount of fried noodles, some sweet, some salty, mixed with peanuts, sesame seeds, and soybeans. This shows the meticulous care of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army. This food is very suitable for the needs of the battlefield; the soldiers all liked it very much. Because when fighting, it is not easy to make a fire, and with this food, you can eat it with hot or cold water, which is not troublesome at all. After the first battle, we received a large shipment of pork in the Hamhung area; each regiment could be divided into two or three whole pigs. When the soldiers learned that this was sent by the people of Northeast China, by truck and livestock, from more than a thousand miles away from the motherland, many people were moved to tears. The third platoon leader of the ninth company of a certain unit said: "The people of the motherland are supporting us so enthusiastically, I will not only fight for the liberation of all of Korea, but also strive for a Kim Il-sung Medal to bring back to the country."
    Ji Bingqian, a representative, returned from the Western Front battlefield. He personally saw many truck drivers, in order to rush to transport supplies, not sleeping for several nights in a row, their eyes swollen very badly, with bloodshot eyes. He said: This scene deeply moved me and increased my determination to fight.
    From the radio and the newspapers, the comrades of the Volunteer Army knew that the people of the motherland had launched a warm movement to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers—organizing volunteer aid-Korea stretcher teams and medical teams, donating goods, writing letters of sympathy, sewing comfort bags.... Chai Chuanruo, the person in charge of the Volunteer Army representatives, said: This made us very excited and moved, it gave us the confidence and strength to defeat the enemy.
    One day, after the Battle of Unsan, a certain unit of our army learned from the radio that 150,000 people in Northeast China were participating in the volunteer aid-Korea stretcher team. As soon as this news reached every air-raid shelter, a burst of cheers erupted. Young soldier Liu Yanzhong said: "People all over the world who love peace are watching us. The people of the motherland are supporting us in this way, I firmly request to join the tank-fighting team and make contributions to the motherland!" Soldier Sun Guanglin was ill, and his superiors asked him to take a good rest, but he firmly said: "That won't work, I will crawl to the front line!" Seven or eight days later, the unit continued to advance victoriously towards Pyongyang. One late night, snowflakes were floating in the sky, and the soldiers were covered with a thin layer of ice. The Volunteer Army comrades suddenly found a long line of people sitting on the road, resting. They thought it was the Korean People's Army or a team of Korean people supporting the front, and wanted to ask for directions. Comrade Zhang Qiye stepped forward.
    "Mwo Bao!" (Korean for "Hello!")
    "We are not Mwo Bao!"
    The loud voices of the people of the motherland reached the ears of the soldiers, and a burst of warm cheers immediately erupted. The soldiers rushed up and shook hands with each other warmly, expressing cordial sympathy. It turned out that this team was part of the Northeast People's Volunteer Aid-Korea Stretcher Team. There were many people, arranged for two or three li. Some came from Haicheng (Southern Manchuria), some came from Harbin (Northern Manchuria), and some came from Shuangshan (Western Manchuria). This was a great encouragement to the soldiers, and everyone said excitedly: I am not tired even after walking another twenty li. Ji Bingqian personally witnessed this moving scene at the time. When our army was victoriously advancing towards the 38th parallel, he went to a certain company responsible for the main attack in the forced crossing of the Imjin River to give a mobilization report, and told everyone about the stretcher team he had met on the road. The soldiers' fighting spirit became even higher, and they wrote letters of determination one after another. As a result, the company broke through the enemy's heavily fortified Imjin River defense line in only eight minutes.
    On the way back to China, the Volunteer Army representatives once again saw the endless stream of Chinese and Korean people supporting the front, from the north of the Han River to the edge of the Yalu River. The team included ox carts, horse carts, hand carts, small sledges (a type of transportation tool in Northeast China), cars, as well as people carrying on their backs and animals carrying. Many people were pushing small carts, each with wooden boxes containing fifty catties of pork. Representative Ji Bingqian said: When we were riding in a car driving in the center of the road, I couldn't help but shed tears. I was very happy to receive the things sent by the people of the motherland; but today I know how these things were transported.
    After the Volunteer Army representatives stepped onto the land of the motherland, whether on the train or on the road, people noticed them wearing red-edged military uniforms. When they learned that they were the People's Volunteer Army, they applauded warmly, expressed their respect to them, and asked them about their well-being. Upon returning to the capital of the motherland—Beijing, they were warmly welcomed by countless workers, students, faculty, staff, and industrialists and businessmen at lectures for days. People from all walks of life presented them with flags, flowers, and souvenirs, and read out comforting words. A district cadre named Wang Wenyi gave Representative Chai Chuanruo a photo of his whole family, on which he wrote: "Thousands upon thousands of people in the motherland are thinking of you!" The Volunteer Army representatives said: "The people of the motherland love us so much that we are very moved. After returning to the troops, we must convey everything we have seen in the country, especially the deep friendship of the people of the motherland, to all the comrades, resolutely defeat the American aggressors, and live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland."

　　感谢祖国人民的慰问和支援
    ——访问中国人民志愿军回国代表
    林洪
    在中国人民志愿军代表的寓所里，挂满了写着“世界和平保卫者”、“钢骨铁筋”和“抗美援朝为国争光”等字样的锦旗，摆满了无数鲜艳的花束，还有学生、少年儿童队员赠送的一百多枚各种颜色的校徽和纪念章。志愿军代表们谈起祖国人民这样热爱他们，都兴奋地说：这是志愿军同志们的光荣，也是祖国人民的光荣！
    以柴川若为首的志愿军代表们，是远从汉江前线归来的。代表之一董乐辅是参加东线战斗的。他说：要是没有千千万万的中朝人民，冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，翻山越岭，运输弹药物资，我们志愿军是无法作战的。我们收到了大量的炒面，有甜的，有咸的，里面掺有花生米、芝麻和黄豆等物。这可以看出祖国人民对志愿军无微不至的关怀。这种食物非常适合战场上的需要；战士们都很喜爱。因为打起仗来，不好生火，有了这种食物，只要用开水或冷水冲一下，就可以吃，一点都不麻烦。第一次战役结束后，我们在咸兴地区收到了大批猪肉；每个联队可以分到两三个整猪。当战士们知道这是东北人民用车拉，用牲口驮，远从一千多里以外的祖国送来的时候，许多人感动得流下眼泪。某部九连三排排长说：“祖国人民这样热诚地支援我们，我不仅要为解放全朝鲜而战，而且要争取到一个金日成奖章带回国去。”
    嵇炳前代表是从西线战场归来的。他亲眼看见许多汽车司机，为了赶运物资，连续几夜没有睡觉，眼睛红肿得非常厉害，眼边挂着血丝。他说：这情景深深使我感动，也增加了我战斗的决心。
    从广播里，从报纸上，志愿军的同志们知道祖国人民掀起了热烈的慰劳中朝人民战士的运动——组织志愿援朝担架队、医疗队，捐献物品，写慰问信，缝慰劳袋……。志愿军代表负责人柴川若说：这使我们非常兴奋和感动，它给了我们以战胜敌人的信心和力量。
    有一天，云山战役结束后，我军某部从广播里知道东北有十五万人参加志愿援朝担架队。这一消息传到每个防空洞，立刻响起了一片欢呼声。青年战士刘燕中说：“全世界爱好和平的人们都注视着我们。祖国人民这样支援我们，我坚决要求参加打坦克队，为祖国立功！”战士孙广林有病，上级要他好好休养，他坚定地说：“那不行，我爬也要爬到前线去！”七、八天以后，该部继续胜利向平壤进军。有一个深夜，天空飘着雪片，战士们身上结着一层薄冰。志愿军同志们突然发现路上坐着一长列人，正在休息。他们以为是朝鲜人民军或是朝鲜人民支援前线的队伍，想去打听一下路。张起也同志走上前去。
    “么包！”（朝鲜语，打招呼的意思）
    “我们不是么包！”
    响亮的祖国人民的声音，传到战士们的耳中，立刻响起了一片热烈的欢呼声。战士们一拥而上，互相热烈地握手，亲切地慰问。原来这支队伍，就是东北人民志愿援朝担架队的一部分。人数很多，排列了二、三里长。有的是从海城（南满）来的，有的是从哈尔滨（北满）来的，有的是从双山（西满）来的。这对战士们是一个很大的鼓励，大家都兴奋地说：再走二十里也不累。嵇炳前当时曾亲眼看见这一动人的场面。我军向三八线胜利进军的时候，他到担任强渡临津江主攻任务的某连作动员报告，把路上碰见担架队的事向大家讲了。战士们的战斗情绪变得更加高涨，纷纷写决心书。结果该连仅以八分钟的时间，就突破了敌人坚强设防的临津江防线。
    志愿军代表在回国途中，再一次看见中朝人民支援前线的无穷无尽的行列，从汉江北直到鸭绿江边。队伍里有牛车、马车、手推车、小爬犁（东北的一种交通工具）、汽车，还有人背的，牲口驮的。许多人推着小车，每个小车上用木箱装了五十斤猪肉。嵇炳前代表说：当我们坐着汽车从公路中央驶过的时候，我忍不住掉下了眼泪。接到祖国人民送给我的东西，我非常高兴；但今天我才知道，这些东西是怎样运输过来的。
    志愿军代表们踏上祖国的土地后，无论在火车上，或是在马路上，人们看见他们穿着镶红边的军服，都非常注意。等到知道他们是人民志愿军时，都热烈地鼓掌，向他们表示敬意，并且亲切地问寒问暖。回到祖国的首都——北京，连日在讲演会上，受到无数工人、学生、教职员、工商业家的热烈欢迎。各界人民向他们献旗、献花、赠送纪念品，朗读慰问词。有一个叫王文义的区干部，送给柴川若代表一张全家合照的像片，上面写着：“祖国千千万万的人民在惦记着你们！”志愿军代表说：“祖国人民这样的热爱我们，使我们十分感动。回到部队以后，我们一定要把在国内看见的一切，特别是祖国人民的深厚的情谊，向全军同志传达，坚决击败美国侵略者，决不辜负祖国人民的期望。”
