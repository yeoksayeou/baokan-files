Middle School Students' Opinions on Publications
Tu Shuping

Recently, we surveyed student readers from two middle schools in Beijing regarding their opinions on publications. This survey confirmed certain shortcomings in the publishing industry that we had already noticed, and more significantly illustrated that our publishing industry does not adequately cater to middle school students.

According to our survey form, the main items investigated were "books they like to read" and "books they don't like to read." The results of the survey were almost entirely consistent in the following aspects.

1.  They like "books with strong storylines and strong political content," "literary works with strong political content in the form of correspondence, such as reports from the Korean battlefield," "literary works on resisting America and aiding Korea," "song selections for resisting America and aiding Korea," "novels and combat stories." In short, they like literary works that are both strongly story-driven and strongly political. In their view, political content is easier to accept and digest when linked to a good story.

Regarding publications about resisting America and aiding Korea, it is clear that little attention has been paid to the needs of middle school students. As the middle school students themselves pointed out: "There are too few literary works on resisting America and aiding Korea," "There are too few stories about the Korean War," "There is a lack of stories." Therefore, they suggested: "Give more examples," "Collect and publish more heroic deeds from resisting America and aiding Korea," "We hope famous writers will write more about the deeds of model combat heroes," "The current affairs handbook should include Korean correspondence and more vivid examples," "We hope to compile and publish Korean correspondence."

2.  They generally like propaganda materials on resisting America and aiding Korea. Many survey forms indicated that they liked the "Small Series on Resisting America and Aiding Korea," "Current Affairs Handbook," etc. However, these readings are too advanced for junior high school students. Both junior and senior high school students reflected: "The language is not colloquial enough," "Many terms are incomprehensible and should be annotated." Some also believed that "there should be author introductions," "more illustrations should be added," "the font should not be too small." This proves that compiling and printing reading materials for middle school students should be different from general reading materials. We hope that the publishing organizations responsible for providing reading materials for middle school students will pay special attention to this aspect.

They also pointed out some other shortcomings of books on resisting America and aiding Korea: "Too few types," "Content is repetitive," "Some books have inconsistent figures, making people reluctant to believe them."

3.  Among the books they mentioned liking to read were "Small Knowledge of Science," "Juvenile Science Series," and "Popular Science Booklets," etc., but not only are there "too few" books on this subject, but they are also generally "too expensive."

4.  Comic strips are also liked by them (especially junior high school students), but they also feel that the price is "too expensive."

5.  "Travelogue-style geography" and "biographies of great figures" are also welcomed by them, but there are also "too few" of these types of books published.

On certain issues, students had different opinions. For example, regarding theoretical books, many students listed them under the "dislike" category, and some even said they "dislike deeper editorials." However, this does not mean that students cannot accept theory at all. Some students clearly expressed that they liked "Social Science," "Chinese History that is Deeper than Concise Chinese History," "Study Magazine," and "World Knowledge," etc. In fact, some students have broad interests. They like "On Soviet Economic Construction," "The Creation of Labor Heroes," "Life of Soviet Youth," "On Communist Education," "The Life of Peasants After Land Reform," "Introduction to Ethnic Minority Customs," "Introduction to Democratic Parties," "The Inside Story of Various Capitalist Countries," "The Struggle of People in Colonial Countries," etc. Given this wide range of interests, it is not true to say that they cannot accept theory at all. It is evident that a portion of the higher-level students can accept currently published theoretical books, but the majority of middle school students cannot, not because they do not need to read theoretical books, but because the existing theoretical books are written "too dryly." They also do not welcome "books with too many numbers" and "books that are too long." This shows that in order for middle school students to accept theoretical readings, they should be written in a lively and vivid style, and the length should not be too long.

The views on translated novels are also quite divided. Many students indicated that they "dislike" or even "most dislike" translated novels, believing that "the sentences are too long and do not conform to Chinese grammar." Some students pointed out which translated novels are not popular, and this includes works that are generally considered to be relatively well-translated, such as "The Young Guard," "Born of the Storm," "A Real Man," and "Bread." However, some students said they liked "Soviet Patriotic War Novels," "How the Steel Was Tempered," and "Tsushima." Some original novels are also more popular, such as "New Children's Heroes" and "Heroes of Lüliang." How to make valuable translated novels accessible to the majority of middle school students is also a problem. Abridged versions of famous works seem to be a solution, but they often easily damage the spirit and artistic characteristics of the original work and become ordinary storybooks. We believe that under the condition that the translator has a detailed grasp of the spirit of the original work, avoiding inverted sentences and long sentences as much as possible, so that it conforms to the characteristics of Chinese grammar, should be a good method. This naturally requires more effort, and it is also easy to damage the artistic atmosphere of the original work, but this is worth advocating. Due to the difficulty of this work, perhaps there should be different translations and different requirements for different readers. The translation prepared for middle school students should especially emphasize that it reads smoothly.

Some unreasonable situations in the current publishing industry are also reflected in the opinions of middle school students. They advocate "reviewing readings and publishing them carefully." Under the current conditions, this is naturally more difficult to handle. However, there are some things that can be done but have not been done. For example, they pointed out that the same book is published under different names, which seems very confusing. For example, Gorky's articles about Lenin's memoirs have several different translated versions. Furthermore, some books, even after being criticized by this newspaper, are still being sold in large quantities by publishers, such as "New Children's Heroes of the Soviet Union." Also, books that are toxic should be banned from sale. These situations are partly related to the political responsibility and serious criticism and self-criticism work of publishers, and partly rely on the publishing leadership to better conduct investigations and research and guidance on publishing work. Active guidance is very important, which can give publishers confidence and methods to do a good job in publishing.

The following opinion is very noteworthy: "The publication of new books should have unified leadership, so that readers can carry out systematic learning." The publishing industry and the criticism community have indeed done too little in this area. For example, correctly compiling various reading lists suitable for middle school students, as well as publishing "Must-Read for Middle School Students" learning books in a planned manner, are all worth doing.

Regarding textbooks, they believe that the general content is still too deep. This opinion is worth the attention of textbook editing and publishing institutions. Some of the commonly used middle school textbooks, in addition to some inappropriate content, also suffer from the common problems of condensed materials (such as national history) and difficult language.

In addition, such as "There are no historical pictures in history textbooks" and "Textbooks are not published in time," are indeed shortcomings and should be improved.

They expressed that they do not know what new books have been published, and hope that new books should be advertised and have introductions when they are published. Bookstore distribution institutions should use various methods to introduce books related to youth to students. They hope that bookstores should send people to deliver books purchased by schools (specifically pointing out that Xinhua Bookstore does not deliver), and also criticized bookstores for closing too early. These opinions should be paid attention to and considered for adoption by general bookstore distribution workers to meet the needs of middle school student readers.

### 中学生对出版物的意见

　　中学生对出版物的意见
　　涂树平
    最近我们调查了北京两个中学校的学生读者对出版物的意见。这个调查证实了我们已经发觉的出版界亟待克服的某些缺点，并且更显著地说明了我们出版界对于中学生层读者照顾得十分不够。
    按照我们的调查表，调查的主要项目是他们“喜欢看的书”和“不喜欢看的书”。调查的结果，在下列几点上，几乎是完全一致的。
    一、他们欢喜“故事性强，政治性也强的书”、“政治性强的、通讯体裁的文艺作品，如朝鲜战场上的通讯报导”、“抗美援朝的文艺作品”、“抗美援朝歌选”、“小说、战斗故事”。总之，他们欢喜故事性、政治性都强的文艺作品。在他们看来，政治性如果和故事性联系在一起，那就更容易接受和消化。
    就有关抗美援朝的出版物来说，显然很少注意到中学生们的需要。正如中学生们自己所指出：“抗美援朝的文艺作品太少”、“朝鲜战斗故事太少”、“缺少故事”。因此他们建议：“多举些实例”、“应把抗美援朝中英雄事迹多搜集出版”、“希望名作家多编写关于模范战斗英雄事迹”、“时事手册应加朝鲜通讯，多举生动例子”、“希望把朝鲜通讯汇集出版”。
    二、他们一般都欢喜抗美援朝宣传读物，许多调查表上都填了他们欢喜《抗美援朝小丛书》、《时事手册》等。但这些读物对于初中学生说来内容嫌太深了。不论初中高中学生都有这种反映：“文字不够通俗”、“许多名词看不懂，应多加注释”。还有的认为“应有作者介绍”、“应多加插画”、“字体不要太小”。这证明编印中学生读物应该和一般读物有所不同。我们希望负担着供给中学生读物任务的出版机关对这方面要特别加以注意。
    他们也指出了抗美援朝书籍的一些其他缺点：“种类太少”、“内容重复”、“有些书数字不相符合，使人不敢相信”。
    三、他们提出爱读的书籍中，有《科学小常识》、《少年科学丛书》、《通俗自然科学小册子》等，但关于这方面的书不但出得“太少”，而且嫌一般售价“太贵”。
    四、连环画也是他们（特别是初中学生）所爱好的，但是也认为售价“太贵”了。
    五、“游记式的地理”、“伟人传记”，也是他们所欢迎的，但是这类书籍也出得“太少”。
    在某些问题上，学生们中意见有着出入。例如关于理论书，很多学生把它列入“不欢喜”的项目中，有的还说“不欢喜较深的社论”。但这不能说明学生们完全不能接受理论，有的学生明明表示欢喜《社会科学》、《较中国史话为深的中国史》、《学习杂志》、《世界知识》等。事实上，有些学生的兴趣很广泛，他们欢喜《关于苏联经济建设》、《劳动英雄的创造》、《苏联青年人生活》、《论共产主义教育》、《土改后的农民生活》、《少数民族习惯介绍》、《民主党派介绍》、《各资本主义国家内幕》、《殖民地国家人民的斗争》等等，既然有这种广泛的兴趣，说是完全不能接受理论，那是不合事实的。由此可见，目前出版的理论书，一部分水平高的学生可以接受，大多数的中学生可接受不了，原因不是他们不需要读理论书，而是现有的理论书写得“太枯燥”了。他们也不欢迎“数字太多的书”和篇幅“太长的书”。这说明了要使中学生接受理论读物，那就应该写得生动活泼，篇幅也不宜太大。
    又如对翻译小说的看法也颇有分歧。许多学生表示他们“不欢喜”甚至“最不欢喜”翻译小说，认为“句子太长不合中国文法”，有些学生提出了那些翻译小说不受欢迎，这中间竟包括着一般人认为译得比较好的作品，如：《青年近卫军》、《暴风雨所诞生的》、《真正的人》、《面包》；但有的学生却说明他们欢喜《苏联卫国战争小说》、《钢铁是怎样炼成的》、《对马》。有些创作小说也受到较多的欢迎，如《新儿女英雄传》、《吕梁英雄传》。如何使有价值的翻译小说能接近大多数中学生，这也是个问题。名著的缩写本似乎是一个办法，然而它常常容易损坏原作的精神和艺术上的特点而变成普通的故事书。我们认为：在翻译者详细掌握原作的精神的条件下，尽可能避免倒插句、长句，使能合于中国语法特点，该是个好办法。这自然要费更大力气，而且也容易弄得伤害原作的艺术气氛，然而这是值得提倡的。由于这件工作的困难，也许对不同的读者应该有不同的译本和不同的要求，为中学生所准备的译本应该特别强调读起来顺口。
    目前出版界某些不合理的情况，也反映在中学生们的意见中。他们主张“审核读物，慎重出版”。这在目前条件下，自然是比较难办的事。但有些事是能够办到却还没有办到的，例如他们指出同样的书用不同的名字出版，显得很乱，象高尔基写的关于列宁的回忆录的文章，就有好几种名称不同的译本。又如有些书虽经本报批评，但出版者仍然在大量销售，如《苏联新儿女英雄传》。再如对有毒的书应该禁售之类。这些情形，一部分关系于出版者的政治责任心和严肃的批评与自我批评工作，一部分要依靠出版领导机关更好地进行对出版工作的调查研究和指导。积极指导是很重要的，这可以使出版者有信心和有方法把出版工作办好。
    下面一个意见很值得注意：“出版新书应有统一领导，使读者可进行系统学习。”出版界和批评界对于这一方面的工作确是做得太不够。例如，正确编制出来的适合中学生阅读的各种学习书目，以及有计划地出版《中学生必读》的学习书籍，都是值得做的。
    对于教科书，他们认为一般地内容仍嫌深。这个意见很值得教科书的编辑出版机构注意，目前通用的一些中学教科书，除了某些内容上的不妥外，材料浓缩（如本国史）、文字艰深也是通病。
    此外如《历史课本没有历史图》、《教科书出版不及时》，的确都是缺点，应该改进。
    他们表示不知道出版了些什么新书，希望新书出版要登广告要有介绍词，书店发行机构应该用各种方式向同学介绍有关青年的书籍。他们希望书店对学校购书应派人分送（特别指明新华书店不送），又指摘书店关门太早。这些意见，一般书店发行工作者均应加以注意，考虑采纳，以满足中学生读者的需要。
