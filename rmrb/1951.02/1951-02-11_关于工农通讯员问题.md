　　On the Issue of Worker-Peasant Correspondents
            I. News Administration's Reply to the East China News and Publication Bureau
    To Comrade Yun Yiqun of the East China News and Publication Bureau and all National News and Publication Bureaus and Newspapers:
    Understood from your letter. The purpose of developing worker-peasant correspondents is to raise the political enthusiasm of the worker-peasant masses, expose and improve the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party and the government, and regularly report on fresh things in the lives of the masses. Worker-peasant correspondents are enthusiastic amateur writers from among the worker-peasant masses. Newspapers should develop such amateur writers among advanced production workers and activists, engineers and technicians, rural intellectuals and rural cadres, and Party, trade union, and peasant association workers through their own reporters. Worker-peasant correspondents are not staff members of the newspaper editorial department. There is no fixed organizational relationship between them and the newspaper, and there is no fixed organizational relationship among themselves. They are free to choose which newspaper they wish to write for. However, in reality, there may be cases where Party workers, due to their awareness, first write for the central and local Party newspapers, and trade union workers first write for the trade union newspapers, etc. This is completely natural and not mandatory. The key lies in the newspaper's own mass work. Newspapers that value submissions from worker-peasant correspondents, actively assist and organize them to write, and give their submissions importance, will be able to attract a large number of worker-peasant correspondents. Apart from this, newspapers should not take any coercive measures to obtain稿件submissions from worker-peasant correspondents. It is wrong for trade unions, peasant associations, or administrative responsible parties to restrict their members from writing for newspapers, for newspapers to define the scope of developing worker-peasant correspondents on their own, or to restrict worker-peasant correspondents from writing for other newspapers.
    Some places have discovered the phenomenon of worker-peasant correspondents submitting one manuscript to multiple publications. The formation of this phenomenon should mainly be the responsibility of the newspaper editorial department. Newspapers do not value submissions from worker-peasant correspondents, do not assist and organize them to write, and do not give their submissions importance, which of course affects some writers, forcing them to adopt the method of submitting one manuscript to multiple publications to find a way out for their submissions. To change this phenomenon, the attitude of the editorial department towards submissions should be changed first. After the editorial department changes its attitude towards submissions, the phenomenon of submitting one manuscript to multiple publications will gradually decrease. For the remaining cases of this phenomenon, appropriate educational methods can be used to eliminate them.
            II. Response from This Newspaper's Editorial Department to the Henan Daily Editorial Office
    Henan Daily Editorial Office:
    Your letter of January 25th has been received.
    In its December 26th reply to Comrade Yun Yiqun of the East China News and Publication Bureau regarding the issue of worker-peasant correspondents, the News Administration first stated: "Worker-peasant correspondents are amateur writers from among the worker-peasant masses." In the following list of development targets, it placed "advanced production workers and activists" in the first place, the meaning of which is very clear. Engineers and technicians also belong to the working class and are directly engaged in industrial production with workers. Those with political awareness should of course also be developed as worker correspondents, and their own class composition and family background should generally not be confused. In the old liberated areas, a new generation of rural intellectuals has begun to emerge. In the newly liberated areas, there are also many rural intellectuals (including many rural primary school teachers) who serve the people and have close ties with the peasants, and they are often the ghostwriters for peasant activists. Such people can of course also be developed into rural correspondents. As for developing worker-peasant correspondents among Party, trade union, and peasant association workers, this refers to personnel in factories and rural areas. It would be incorrect to interpret all correspondents in provincial, district, and county-level agencies as worker-peasant correspondents for this reason.
    Some newspapers interpret worker-peasant correspondents as narrowly defined correspondents from among workers and peasants, and do not pay attention to the fact that while activists from among workers and peasants in the narrow sense are indeed the main part of worker-peasant correspondents, other mental laborers who have close ties with industrial production and agricultural production, worker life, and peasant life are also important development targets. It would be a loss to the newspaper if they are not absorbed to participate in newspaper work. However, it would be wrong to only focus on developing correspondents among engineers and technicians, rural intellectuals and rural cadres, and Party, trade union, and peasant association workers, and not pay attention to developing correspondents among advanced production workers and activists in factories and rural areas.

　　关于工农通讯员问题 
            一、新闻总署复华东新闻出版局电
    华东新闻出版局恽逸群同志并全国各新闻出版局和报社：
    函悉。发展工农通讯员的目的在于提高工农群众的政治积极性，揭发并改进党和政府工作中的缺点和错误，经常报道群众生活中的新鲜事物。工农通讯员是工农群众中的一些热心的业余写稿人。报纸应当通过自己的记者在生产先进分子和积极分子中，工程师和技术人员中，农村知识分子和农村干部中，党和工会、农会工作者中发展这种业余写稿人。工农通讯员不是报纸编辑部的工作人员。他们与报纸之间没有固定的组织关系，他们自己彼此之间也没有固定的组织关系。他们愿为什么报纸写稿，有选择的自由。但事实上可能会有这样一些情形，即党工作者由于他们的自觉而首先为中央和地方的党的机关报写稿，工会工作人员首先为工会机关报写稿等。这是完全自然的，而非强制性的。决定的关键在于报纸本身的群众工作。凡是重视工农通讯员来稿，积极帮助和组织他们写稿并给他们的来稿以地位的报纸，便能争取到大量的工农通讯员。除此以外，报纸不应采取任何强制的手段来获得工农通讯员的稿件。工会农会或行政负责方面限制其成员为报纸写稿，各报自行划定发展工农通讯员的范围或限制工农通讯员为他报写稿，都是不对的。
    有的地方发现工农通讯员有一稿两投的现象。这种现象的形成，主要应由报纸编辑部负责。报纸不重视工农通讯员来稿，不帮助和组织他们写稿，不给他们来的稿件以地位，当然也就影响到一部分写稿人，使他们不能不采取一稿两投的办法来为自己的稿件寻找出路。要改变这种现象，首先应当改变编辑部对待来稿的态度。在编辑部改变了对待来稿的态度以后，一稿两投的现象将会逐渐减少。对于最后残存的这种现象，是可以用适当的教育方法使之消灭的。
            二、本报编辑部答河南日报总编室河南日报总编室：
    一月二十五日来信收到。
    新闻总署在十二月二十六日复华东新闻出版局恽逸群同志关于工农通讯员问题的电文中，首先就说明：“工农通讯员是工农群众中的一些业余的写稿人”，在以下列举的发展对象中，又把“生产先进分子和积极分子”摆在第一位，其涵义是很明确的。工程师和技术人员也属于工人阶级，并且是与工人一起直接从事工业生产的，其中有政治觉悟的积极分子当然也应该发展为工人通讯员，其本人阶级成份和他的家庭出身一般地不宜混为一谈。在老解放区中，已开始产生出一代新的农村知识分子。在新解放区中也有许多为人民服务并与农民有密切联系的农村知识分子（包括许多农村小学教师），他们常是农民积极分子的代笔人。这种人当然也可以发展成为农村通讯员。至于在党和工会、农会工作者中发展工农通讯员，指的是工厂农村中的人员。如果因此就把省、地、县级机关中的通讯员都解释为工农通讯员，是不对的。
    有些报纸把工农通讯员解释为狭义的工人和农民中的通讯员，而不注意狭义的工人和农民中的积极分子固然是工农通讯员中的主要部分，其他与工业生产和农业生产、工人生活和农民生活有密切关系的脑力劳动者也是重要的发展对象。不吸收他们来参加报纸工作，将是报纸的一种损失。但是，如果只注意在工程师和技术人员中，农村知识分子和农村干部中，党和工会、农会工作者中发展通讯员，而不注意在工人和农村的生产先进分子和积极分子中发展通讯员，那便是错误的。
