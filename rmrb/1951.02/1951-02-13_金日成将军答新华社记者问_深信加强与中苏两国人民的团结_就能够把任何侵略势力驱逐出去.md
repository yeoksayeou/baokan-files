Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Supreme Commander of the People's Army, recently met with a reporter from this agency at the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army and gave the following answers to several questions:

　　Question: On the occasion of the heroic Korean People's Army's third anniversary, could you, Prime Minister – the organizer and leader of the People's Army – tell us about the main achievements and experiences of the People's Army in the seven and a half months of the great Fatherland Liberation War?

　　Answer: The Korean People's Army has been established for three years. Although three years is a short time, the People's Army has achieved great results in carrying out the task of defending its motherland and people, and the People's Army itself has grown into a fairly strong army.

　　The People's Army is bravely annihilating the US imperialist invading army and its accomplices from Britain, Turkey, Canada, Australia and other countries, which are superior to it in number and technology. The bravely fighting People's Army has withstood the test under extremely cruel and severe conditions.

　　The officers and soldiers of the People's Army, who have been tempered in the course of the war, have not only learned how to break through the enemy's solid positions and attack the enemy, but also how to stubbornly defend against the enemy's attacks, break through the enemy's encirclement, and carry out organized retreats when conditions are unfavorable. The People's Army has become an excellent army that is not only good at carrying out mobile warfare to encircle and annihilate enemies with superior weapons and technology, but also good at going deep behind enemy lines to cut off enemy retreat routes and attack enemy headquarters and transportation lines with guerrilla warfare.

　　The People's Army has gained a lot of practical experience in the war, and its combat effectiveness has greatly improved.

　　The commanders of the People's Army have learned how to command, unite, and educate their troops in complex environments. The soldiers of the People's Army have shown unparalleled loyalty and tenacity in carrying out combat missions, uniting closely, observing strict discipline, and cherishing their weapons.

　　The People's Army has not only improved in quality, but also developed in quantity.

　　The combat skills learned by the People's Army from military regulations have become more proficient in actual combat.

　　In a word: During the seven months of the Fatherland Liberation War, the People's Army has been tempered in actual combat, gained a lot of experience, and made great progress both in quality and quantity.

　　All this is because the People's Army itself is composed of outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people, and the war it is waging is a just liberation war to defend the interests of the motherland and the people, and it is supported by the entire people.

　　Question: What is the military and political significance of the great victory of the People's Army's New Year offensive in fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army?

　　Answer: The great victories that the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have achieved in fighting side by side, from the first battle to the third battle, are of great military and political significance.

　　The enemy, who had invaded north of the Chongchon River, attempted to drive our People's Army to the Yalu River in one go. The arrogant murderer MacArthur deceived his own army by saying that he would completely occupy Korea before Christmas and guarantee their return home. The US imperialists and their accomplice countries praised MacArthur's arrogant plan as an excellent strategy.

　　However, due to the counterattack of our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American aggressors and their accomplices fled in panic south of the Han River after losing nearly 100,000 troops.

　　As a result of our successive victories in the three battles, the enemy's morale was low, internal contradictions deepened, and they shirked responsibility from each other, arguing with each other, and the aggressive bloc began to split. On the contrary, the morale of our army has been improved, the unity of our camp has been further consolidated, the international aid received by the Korean people has been increasing, and the Korean people's confidence in victory has been increasingly firm. The people in the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy have become more hostile to the enemy in view of the enemy's atrocities. In this way, the conditions for the liberation war to be victorious in Korea have been fully ensured.

　　Question: What is the current recovery situation in the vast areas that have been re-liberated? What is the situation of the people's struggle in the enemy-occupied areas that have not yet been liberated?

　　Answer: In the re-liberated areas, the people's political power organs and political parties and social organizations that were destroyed by the enemy's atrocities have almost all been restored. The broad masses of the people are repairing the damaged railways and highways, preparing food, and mobilizing to participate in the transportation work to ensure the food needs of the People's Army. At the same time, the production of military supplies and the preparations for spring sowing are also being widely carried out, and farmers have vowed to make the production of food not lower than before the war.

　　The government's policy of stabilizing the people's lives has been warmly supported. The people in the recovered areas are sorting out the damaged houses and factories, and participating in the restoration of cultural institutions and the work of rescuing refugees and sheltering orphans. In the enemy-occupied areas that have not yet been liberated, the people's guerrilla movement has been widely launched. The guerrillas are constantly growing and becoming stronger in the course of combat.

　　In short, the entire Korean people are fighting to mobilize all possible forces to win the final victory and completely liberate the whole of Korea.

　　Question: What are your views on the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, which is being enthusiastically launched throughout China?

　　Answer: The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, which is currently being widely launched by the Chinese people in all parts of China, has indeed further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory. With the help of the great Chinese people with a population of nearly 500 million, the Korean people will be able to drive out any aggressor forces.

　　The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, which is being widely launched in China, not only strengthens the Korean people's confidence in victory in the liberation struggle, but also has great significance in the cause of striving for peace in Asia and peace in the world.

　　The Korean people have increased their confidence for this movement and deeply believe that only by strengthening the unity with the great Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world can they guarantee their independence and freedom, and also jointly defend world peace.

　　金日成将军答新华社记者问
　  深信加强与中苏两国人民的团结   
    就能够把任何侵略势力驱逐出去
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相、人民军最高司令官金日成将军，于日前在人民军最高司令部接见本社记者，发表对于几个问题的答复如下：
    问：当此英雄的朝鲜人民军建军三周年之际，您，首相先生——人民军的组织者与领导者，可否以人民军在七个半月伟大的祖国解放战争过程中的主要成就与经验见告？
    答：朝鲜人民军建军已三周年了。三年的时间虽然很短，但是，人民军在执行保卫自己祖国与人民的任务中业已取得很大的成果，而人民军本身也成长为相当强大的军队了。
    人民军英勇地消灭着在数量上和技术上比自己占优势的美帝国主义侵略军及其帮凶英国、土耳其、加拿大、澳大利亚等国的军队。英勇斗争着的人民军在极端残酷与严重的条件下，经受了考验。
    在战争过程中受到锻炼的人民军官兵，不仅学会了突破敌人的巩固阵地和进攻敌人，而且学会了顽强地防御敌人的进攻，突破敌人的包围网，并在条件不利的时候作有组织的退却。人民军已经变成既善于进行迂回、围歼具有优势武器与技术的敌人的运动战，又善于深入敌后进行切断敌人退路、袭击敌人参谋部和运输线的游击战的优秀军队了。
    人民军在战争过程中取得了许多实战经验，战斗能力也大有进步。
    人民军指挥员们学会了在复杂的环境中如何统率、团结和教育自己的部队。人民军战士们在执行战斗任务中，亲密团结，严守纪律，爱护自己的武器，表现了无比的忠诚和顽强。
    人民军不仅在质量上提高了，而且在数量上也有了发展。
    人民军从军事规程上所习得的战斗技术，在实际战斗中更加熟练了。
    一句话：人民军在祖国解放战争的七个多月期间，在实际战斗中受到锻炼，取得了许多经验，不论在质量上或数量上，都有了很大的进步。
    这一切，是因为人民军本身系由朝鲜人民的优秀儿女组成，它所进行的战争是保卫祖国与人民利益的正义的解放战争，受着全体人民的支持的缘故。
    问：在和中国人民志愿部队并肩作战中，人民军新年攻势的伟大胜利，在军事上、政治上的意义如何？
    答：人民军和中国人民志愿部队并肩作战，从第一个战役到第三个战役所业已取得的伟大胜利，在军事上、政治上，有很大意义。
    曾经侵犯到清川江以北的敌人，妄图一鼓作气，把我们人民军驱逐到鸭绿江边。骄横无比的杀人魔王麦克阿瑟欺骗他自己的军队说，在耶诞节以前完全占领朝鲜后，保证他们回家。美帝国主义者及其帮凶国家，把麦克阿瑟的这个狂妄计划赞扬为绝好妙计。
    然而，由于我们人民军和中国人民志愿军的反攻，美国侵略者及其帮凶们在丧失了近十万的军队之后，惊慌失措地逃到汉江以南去了。
    我们在三次战役中连获胜利的结果，敌人的士气低落了，内部的矛盾加深了，于是，彼此推卸责任，互相争吵，侵略集团内部开始分裂。相反地，我们军队的士气提高了，我们阵营的团结更加巩固了，朝鲜人民所得到的国际援助愈来愈多，朝鲜人民的胜利信心日益坚定。曾被敌人暂时侵占的地区的人民，鉴于敌人的暴行，对敌人的敌忾心更加高涨。这样，就完全确保了解放战争在朝鲜一定要胜利的条件。
    问：重获解放的广大地区目前的恢复情况怎样？尚未解放的敌占区的人民斗争情况怎样？
    答：在重获解放的地区，由于敌人的暴行而被破坏的人民政权机关和政党、社会团体几乎已全部恢复起来了。广大的人民修复被破坏的铁道和公路，准备着食粮，并动员起来参加着保障人民军食粮需要的运输工作。同时，军需品生产和春季播种的准备工作也在广泛地展开着，农民宣誓要使食粮的生产量不低于战前。
    政府安定人民的生活的政策受到热烈拥护。收复区人民整理着被破坏的房子和工厂，并参加文化机关的恢复工作和救济难民、收容孤儿的工作。在尚未解放的敌占区，人民游击运动已广泛展开。游击队在战斗过程中，不断地成长、壮大。
    总之，全朝鲜人民为争取最后胜利，彻底解放全朝鲜，正为动员一切可能动员的力量而奋斗。
    问：您对于目前在全中国热烈展开的中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动，有何意见？
    答：目前中国人民在全中国各地广泛展开着的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，的确使朝鲜人民的胜利信心进一步地加强了。朝鲜人民有了近五亿人口的伟大的中国人民的援助，就能够把任何侵略势力驱逐出去。
    在中国广泛展开着的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，不仅使朝鲜人民在解放斗争中加强了胜利信心，而且在争取亚洲和平与全世界和平的事业上，也有着重大的意义。
    朝鲜人民为这一运动而提高了自己的信心，并深信：只有加强与伟大的苏联、中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民的团结，才能保障自己的独立和自由，也才能共同保卫世界和平。
