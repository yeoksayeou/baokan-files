　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
　　China Association for Promoting Democracy
　　It is the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. A year ago, Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been solidified by the treaty, is permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice." The developments of the past year have fully proved that Chairman Mao's prediction is absolutely correct.
　　Due to the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we have a great allied country unprecedented in history. Over the past year, the construction of New China in various aspects such as economy, politics, and culture has expanded its achievements due to the assistance of the Soviet Union. Especially in the great struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea, the Chinese and Korean people have achieved decisive victories, repeatedly crushing the armed attacks and political conspiracies of US imperialism, deepening the chaos and division of the US ruling class, expanding the contradictions between imperialisms, and greatly inspiring the victorious confidence of the oppressed and enslaved people of the whole of Asia and the world in their liberation struggle. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union far exceeds the strength of the imperialist camp, which is inseparable from the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the close and seamless unity and cooperation of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union.
　　The facts of the past year have clearly educated the Chinese people and the people of the world—who is the enemy? Who is the friend? What is true peaceful and friendly cooperation? What is "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton," with sugar-coated poison labeled as "friendship"?—Who transferred batches of large-scale enterprises and properties obtained from Japanese imperialists in the Northeast to our country free of charge? And who has repeatedly strafed our people and dropped sinister bombs dozens of times on our northeastern border and Shandong coast? Who is actively helping our country in various aspects such as economy and culture to recover and build? And who is armed invading our neighboring country and our territory of Taiwan, directly threatening our security and undermining our unity and construction? Who was the first to recognize the People's Republic of China and establish diplomatic relations with us? And who has always been closely colluding with the Kuomintang bandit gang, manipulating the United Nations, and repeatedly refusing to recognize our country's legitimate status in the United Nations? Who is loyal to the alliance treaty to jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascist aggressive forces to ensure Asian peace and world peace? And who tore up all international agreements and conspired to plot a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearming Japan to expand its war of aggression, and save the failure of its military adventure in Korea? Who presides over justice and accuses the enemies who invaded China and Korea in the United Nations? And who reverses right and wrong, confuses black and white, and slanders our just action of resisting America and aiding Korea as "aggressors"?... Except for the insane imperialists who deliberately distort the facts, is there anyone with a clear understanding of things who wouldn't understand these things today?
　　Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we must first thank the wise, far-sighted, and correct leadership of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao. In the past year, under the Sino-Soviet alliance and friendship unity, the Chinese people have won great victories in the cause of defending world peace and opposing American aggression, and the Chinese people have also achieved great victories on the cultural and economic fronts. However, the revolutionary construction of New China has only taken the first step of the Long March. We must learn more humbly from the Soviet Union and absorb their rich, valuable, and advanced experiences to complete our great national construction tasks. Especially today, when US imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan are stepping up their collusion in an attempt to expand the war of aggression, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance should play its great effect even more. The people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, will inevitably further strengthen their friendly mutual assistance, unity, and cooperation, so that all the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries will continue to be smashed to pieces under the iron fists of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union. Wherever the aggressive claws of US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries extend, we will cut them off there. We firmly believe that the strength of the friendly alliance of our 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union is invincible. With the unity and cooperation of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, and with the warm support of peace-loving people all over the world, we will inevitably victoriously complete the construction of our great motherland, smash all imperialist aggression, and ensure true peace and lasting peace. Finally, let us shout:
　　Long live the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet people!
　　Long live the victory of world peace!
　　Long live Marshal Stalin!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年
　　中国民主促进会
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年了。一年前毛主席说：“业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结不但必然要影响两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”一年来事实的发展，充分证明毛主席的预见是千真万确的。
    由于中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，使我们有了历史上空前未有的伟大的同盟国。一年来新中国在经济政治文化等各方面建设都因有苏联盟邦援助而扩大了成就，尤其在抗美援朝这一伟大斗争上，中朝人民取得决定性的胜利，接二连三粉碎美帝的武装进攻和政治阴谋，加深了美帝统治阶级的混乱和分裂，扩大了帝国主义间的矛盾，大大鼓舞了全亚洲全世界被压迫被奴役人民解放斗争的胜利信心。以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量大大超过帝国主义阵营的力量，更是和中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，中苏七万万人民亲密无间的团结合作分不开的。
    一年来的事实很清楚地教育着中国人民以及全世界人民——谁是敌人？谁是朋友？什么是真正的和平友好合作？什么是“挂羊头卖狗肉”糖纸包着毒药的“友谊”？——是谁把从日本帝国主义者手中获得的在东北的大量企业和财产一批批无偿地移交我国？又是谁在我国东北边境和山东沿海数十百次地扫射我国人民和投下罪恶的炸弹？是谁帮助我国经济文化等各方面积极恢复和建设？又是谁武装侵略我国邻邦和我领土台湾，直接威胁我国安全和破坏我国统一和建设？是谁首先承认中华人民共和国并与我建立外交关系？又是谁始终与国民党匪帮密切勾结，操纵联合国，三番五次拒绝承认我国在联合国的合法地位？是谁忠于同盟条约共同防止日本法西斯侵略势力的再起，以确保亚洲和平与世界和平？又是谁撕毁一切国际协议阴谋，策动片面对日媾和、重新武装日本以扩大侵略战争，挽救在朝鲜军事冒险的失败？是谁主持正义向联合国控诉侵略中国侵略朝鲜敌人的罪行？又是谁颠倒是非混淆黑白诬蔑我国抗美援朝正义行动为“侵略者”？……这些在今天除了丧心病狂的帝国主义存心歪曲事实，还有任何明白事理的人会不清楚吗？
    今天我们庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年，首先要感谢斯大林大元帅和毛主席英明的、有远见的、正确的领导。一年来在中苏同盟友好团结之下，中国人民在保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的事业中已赢得伟大的胜利，中国人民在文化经济战线上也取得伟大的胜利，但新中国的革命建设还只走了万里长征的第一步，我们还要更多地向苏联盟邦虚心学习，吸取他们丰富的宝贵的先进的经验，完成我们伟大的建国任务。尤其今天美帝国主义与日本反动吉田政府加紧勾结，以图扩大侵略战争，中苏友好同盟互助条约更应发挥其伟大效用。中苏两大国人民必然还要更进一步加强友好互助团结合作，让美帝国主义及日本反动派的一切侵略阴谋，在中苏七万万人民的铁拳下继续被打得粉碎。只要美帝国主义和日本反动派的侵略魔掌伸到那里，我们就把它斩断在那里。我们坚信我们中苏七万万人民的友好同盟的力量是无敌的。在中苏七万万人民的团结合作下，在全世界爱好和平人民热烈支援下，我们必然胜利地完成伟大祖国的建设，粉碎一切帝国主义的侵略，确保真正和平与持久和平。最后让我们高呼：
    中苏人民友好团结万岁！
    世界和平胜利万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
