Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Progressive Public Opinion in Various Capitalist Countries Supports Stalin's Talk

According to TASS: The Norwegian newspaper *Friheten's* editorial said: "Stalin's call for the people of all countries to work together to change the direction of international developments is a frank and open call, with the aim of rebuilding international cooperation and consolidating peace."

The Iranian newspaper *Navid-e Ayandeh* stated on the 20th that Stalin's talk "is an effective weapon in the struggle against the warmongers."

The Israeli newspaper *Kol Ha'am* wrote: "Stalin expressed great confidence, firmly believing that the peace-loving people of all countries can shatter the conspiracies of the American and British warmongers in the struggle for peace. The people of Israel will join with the people of the world to strengthen their struggle for peace and independence."

According to Dentsu News Agency: Dr. Noble, Secretary-General of the Mexican Peace Committee, told a Dentsu reporter: "Stalin's talk strengthened the recent decisions of the Warsaw Peace Congress." He said, "Stalin's comments on the governments of Latin American countries are true. There is no doubt that these governments supported the United States' efforts to turn the United Nations into a tool for implementing war policies. But the people of Latin American countries do not agree with their governments' policy."

The Cuban newspaper *Última Hora's* editorial on the 20th also said: Stalin's rebuke of the Latin American countries' representatives for subserviently supporting Washington's aggressive policies in the United Nations is absolutely correct. Cuba's representative in the United Nations "does not represent the views and wishes of our people, but the interests and greed of landlords and businessmen. These people are eager for a new war, and to achieve this goal, they do not hesitate to sell out our national independence." "Therefore, the struggle for peace, for a peaceful resolution of conflicts, and for the adoption of an independent policy is essentially a patriotic task. The completion of this task is not just a matter for a few people, but for all patriotic Cubans."

    拥护斯大林谈话
    【新华社二十三日讯】各资本主义国家进步舆论热烈拥护斯大林对真理报记者的谈话。
    据塔斯社讯：挪威自由报的社论说：“斯大林号召各国人民协力来改变国际局势发展的方向，这是一个光明磊落的号召，其目的在重建国际合作及巩固和平。”
    伊朗《纳维德·阿阳德报》二十日称：斯大林的谈话“是反对战争贩子的斗争中的有效武器”。
    以色列《科尔·哈姆报》写道：“斯大林表示巨大的信心，坚信爱好和平的各国人民在争取和平的斗争中能够粉碎美英战争贩子的阴谋。以色列人民将和全世界人民一道，加强自己争取和平与独立的斗争。”
    另据电通社讯：墨西哥和平委员会总书记诺布尔博士对电通社记者谈称：“斯大林的谈话加强了最近华沙和平大会的决定。”他说：“斯大林关于拉丁美洲各国政府的评论是真实的。毫无疑问，这些政府支持了美国把联合国变为实行战争政策的工具的努力。但拉丁美洲各国的人民是不同意他们政府的这个政策的。”
    古巴《最后消息》报二十日社论中也说：斯大林斥责拉丁美洲国家代表在联合国中卑躬屈膝地支持华盛顿的侵略政策，是绝对正确的。古巴在联合国的代表“并不代表我们人民的见解和愿望，而是代表地主和商人的利益和贪欲。这些人渴望发生新的战争，为了达到这目的，他们不惜出卖我们的民族独立”。“因此，争取和平、争取和平解决冲突、争取采取独立政策的斗争，本质上便是一种爱国的任务。这项任务的完成并不单是少数几个人的事，而是全体爱祖国的古巴人的事”。
