　　World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau Warsaw Meeting Concludes
　  Passes Declaration to the Working People of the World
　　Calls for Strengthening Unity to Stop Warmongers' Frenzied Expansion of Armament Plans
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 25th] (TASS dispatch) The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on the 19th, held its final session on the 20th and passed a declaration to the working people of the world. The meeting discussed in detail the issue of strengthening the united action of the working people to defend their economic and social rights and to defend peace. The meeting sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Santa Cruz, urging the Economic and Social Council to recommend that the French government rescind its decision to prohibit the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in France, in violation of the principles declared by the United Nations. The meeting also sent telegrams to French President Auriol and Prime Minister Pleven, strongly condemning the French government's unreasonable decision. The meeting unanimously decided to hold the next Executive Bureau meeting from June 6th to 11th and convene the World Federation of Trade Unions Council in Berlin from September 18th to 25th.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau's declaration to the working people of the world stated: The reactionary measures of the French government in prohibiting the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in French territory cannot stop the World Federation of Trade Unions from struggling for the bright future of the working people. The World Federation of Trade Unions will defend the economic and social demands of the working people with renewed vigor, defend their trade union rights and democratic rights, and defend the independence of the colonial people. It will continue to fight against the remilitarization of West Germany and Japan, to defend peace and the unity of all working people. The World Federation of Trade Unions has proven itself in struggle to be the strong leader of the working people of the world, and it has not only gained the trust and support of the working people of all member organizations, but has also won the trust and support of workers outside these organizations.
    The declaration calls on all trade union organizations and all working people to close their ranks and strengthen unbreakable unity to defend the economic and social rights of the working people and to defend their trade union organizations. This unity is more urgently needed than ever before, because it is the most powerful weapon for the working people to destroy the plans of the warmongers and to stop the imperialists' frenzied expansion of armaments. The declaration finally calls on the working people of the world to strengthen and expand ties with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and to move forward holding high the banner of international workers' solidarity - the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    On the 21st, the working people of Warsaw held a mass rally at the Institute of Technology to pay tribute to the leaders of the world trade union movement.

　　世界工联执行局华沙会议闭幕
　  通过告全世界劳动人民宣言
　　号召加强团结制止战争贩子疯狂扩张军备计划
    【新华社二十五日讯】综合塔斯社消息：十九日在波兰首都华沙举行的世界工会联合会执行局会议，在二十日举行了最后一次会议，并通过了告全世界劳动人民宣言。会议曾详尽地讨论了关于加强劳动人民的一致行动以保卫他们的经济与社会权利和保卫和平的问题。会议致电联合国经社理事会主席圣大克鲁兹，敦促经社理事会建议法国政府撤消其违反联合国所宣布的原则而禁止世界工联在法国活动的决定。会议并致电法国总统阿里奥尔和总理普利文，坚决斥责法国政府这个无理的决定。会议一致决定在六月六日至十一日举行下届执行局会议，在九月十八日至二十五日在柏林召开世界工联理事会。
    世界工联执行局告全世界劳动人民宣言称：法国政府禁止世界工联在法国领土活动的反动措施决不能阻止世界工联为劳动人民美好的将来而斗争。世界工联将以崭新的活力保卫劳动人民的经济和社会要求，保卫他们的工会权利和民主权利，保卫殖民地人民的独立。它将继续为反对西德与日本的重新军国主义化、为保卫和平和一切劳动人民的团结而斗争。世界工联已在斗争中证明它是全世界劳动人民的坚强的领导者，它不仅得到了全体会员团体的劳动人民的信任和拥护，并且也赢得了在这些组织以外的工人的信任和支持。
    宣言号召一切工会组织和全体劳动人民紧密自己的队伍，加强牢不可破的团结，以保卫劳动人民的经济和社会权利，保卫自己的工会组织。这种团结比以前任何时期都有着更迫切的需要，因为它是劳动人民摧毁战争贩子的计划，制止帝国主义者的疯狂扩张军备的最强有力的武器。宣言最后号召全世界劳动人民加强并扩大和世界工联的联系，高举起国际工人团结的旗帜——世界工联的旗帜前进！
    二十一日，华沙劳动人民在工艺研究所举行群众大会，向世界工会运动的领袖们致敬。
