    Launch a Patriotic Campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea
    —Commemorating the 28th Anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident
    Worker's Daily Editorial

    Today is the 28th anniversary of the "February 7th" bloody struggle.

    The historical significance of the "February 7th" bloody struggle lies in the fact that its bloody reality proved that imperialism and feudal warlords were the mortal enemies of the Chinese people. It marked that the Chinese working class at that time had become an independent political force in the domestic political life; it showed that the Chinese working class began to take the lead in the Chinese revolution as the leading class, holding high the banner of opposing imperialism and feudalism, and striding onto the Chinese political stage. In the "February 7th" general strike, the Chinese working class demonstrated a high degree of organization and discipline. Comrades Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang and other martyrs who heroically sacrificed in the "February 7th" general strike were models for Chinese working-class fighters.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has won great victories of historical and world significance after thirty years of arduous and heroic struggle. The Chinese people have stood up. The paper tiger of American imperialism (the largest and last imperialism in world history) has been pierced by the bayonets of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. Therefore, the balance of power between the two major camps in the world—the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the imperialist camp headed by the United States—has undergone a decisive change. The power of the people of the world to defend world peace has been unprecedentedly strengthened. Imperialist elements all over the world who rely on exploiting the blood and sweat of the colonial people for a living are in a state of panic and anxiety, and are increasingly heading towards an irreversible path of collapse. At present, in order to save its disastrous defeat in the Korean War of aggression, and to restore and maintain its bloody and reactionary rule over the Chinese people and other colonial people, American imperialism is carrying out the conspiracy activities of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, and is manipulating the United Nations to pass illegal proposals that reverse black and white and accuse our country of being an "aggressor" as a tool for its further aggression against China and the creation of a world war. The Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has always been the vanguard in resolutely opposing imperialism. We will never allow American imperialism to rearm Japan and massacre the Chinese people again. We must be highly vigilant to defend the vested interests of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, defend the security of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, when we commemorate the 28th anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident, the serious task before our Chinese working class is first of all to carry forward the traditional spirit of the Chinese working class's anti-imperialist struggle of "February 7th" and continue to carry out the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea.

    Through the past two or three months of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend the country and our homes, the broad masses of workers and staff have not only established a correct stand of hating, despising, and looking down upon the United States, and raised their class consciousness, but also, on this basis, launched a patriotic production competition; strengthened and deepened the unity between workers, staff, and technical personnel. However, the patriotic propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea among the masses of workers has not developed very evenly, and there are still great weaknesses. First of all, many trade union cadres still do not have a sufficient understanding of the great political significance and role of this patriotic movement. They believe that the propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea does not seem to be of much necessity for the masses of workers, and some are even afraid that carrying out this work will delay production. Therefore, the patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea among the masses of workers and staff across the country is generally not deep enough; many scattered small factories, mines, and enterprises (such as handicraft workers, shop assistants, and workers and staff in private enterprises, etc.) have not yet been universally involved in the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea; even those factories, mines, and enterprises that have been involved in this movement, the propaganda work is very infrequent and unsystematic. Therefore, when commemorating the 28th anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident this year, the primary political task is to continue to carry out the patriotic propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea in a deep-going manner, and mobilize every worker and staff to participate in this great patriotic movement. It must be pointed out that our struggle against American imperialism is not a short-term matter, but a arduous struggle of a considerable period of time. Therefore, our propaganda work for resisting America among the workers and staff is not short-term, but long-term and regular work. The Enlarged Session of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a declaration calling on workers across the country to hold a parade and demonstration in major cities across the country in the near future against the United States rearming Japan and against the United States manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass proposals that slander our country as an "aggressor." Under the leadership of trade union organizations at all levels, our workers and staff across the country should immediately step up preparations, intensify the study of current affairs regarding resisting America and aiding Korea, and actively participate in this great patriotic movement.

    Secondly, it is necessary to launch a patriotic labor competition among the broad masses of workers. This is a concrete manifestation of the working class opposing aggression and loving the motherland with their own practical actions. Now, after the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Team put forward a patriotic competition challenge to the national workers and staff, it immediately received a warm response from the broad masses of workers and staff across the country. This shows that the Ma Hengchang team competition will raise the patriotic labor competition a step further, and make this movement develop more deeply and persistently. Because this competition is a spontaneous mass movement from the bottom up, and is based on the high patriotic enthusiasm among the masses, all the teams participating in the competition must go through democratic discussions by all team members, and put forward specific and practical competition conditions based on the nature of the work and the work post. These conditions are the concretization of the new labor attitude, and are the best patriotic conventions. This kind of competition can become a truly broad mass competition, and avoid the formalism defects caused by pure top-down arrangements. Therefore, we express our warm welcome and support for the Ma Hengchang team competition that is currently being carried out. We hope that trade union organizations at all levels, especially the general trade unions and municipal industrial trade union committees in various cities, should fully pay attention to the role of this spontaneous competition movement of the masses, and earnestly organize and guide it, so that it can develop steadily forward and persist for a long time. Grassroots trade union organizations should concretely guide and help each team that responds to Ma Hengchang's challenge, and formulate practical and feasible response conditions and team plans according to the objective needs of factories and enterprises, and help them regularly check their work, overcome difficulties, and ensure the realization of the response conditions. Attention should be paid to selecting and cultivating those responding teams as key points, so that they can become Ma Hengchang-style advanced production teams and model trade union teams.

    The characteristics of the Ma Hengchang team are, first of all, breaking the concept of technical conservatism and eliminating the remaining guild-style ideas of "retaining a hand," which has helped all team members, including apprentices, to accelerate progress, complete and exceed the team's production tasks. This has also produced its second characteristic: all team members help each other in production and life, are closely united, and demonstrate the great fraternal spirit and collective heroism of the proletariat, while avoiding the individual championship competition. Its third characteristic is the combination of high labor enthusiasm and technological research, so as to improve the output and quality by transforming production tools and labor organization, so as to maintain the persistence of the competition, and avoid the various evils caused by the "shock" of simply strengthening labor intensity. Its fourth characteristic is to transform the methods created by all team members from research and work experience into regular systems, such as "checking the first work," "doing sets of work," "responsible shift system," "noon technical research meeting," "weekly production review meeting," etc., so that the results obtained each time can be consolidated and persisted. Therefore, the Ma Hengchang team has become the banner of the national advanced production teams, and its competition methods should also become the basic methods of labor competition. Trade union organizations at all levels, all trade union cadres, from the responsible cadres of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, should carefully study the experience of the Ma Hengchang team, improve these experiences, and organize and guide the patriotic labor competition that is currently flourishing according to these experiences.

    However, in organizing and guiding this labor competition, all localities should pay attention to the different specific conditions in various localities, and adopt different methods and steps. In areas where production movement is already experienced and trade union organizations are relatively sound, the Ma Hengchang team competition movement should be organized more extensively, so that it can gradually expand and become a competition between the entire workshop, the entire factory, and between factories. In the cities of these areas, a representative meeting of the city's participants in the Ma Hengchang team competition can be convened at an appropriate time, so as to exchange experiences and improve the labor competition movement and the grassroots trade union organizations. In new areas where production is not normal and trade union work is developing relatively late, only typical advanced production teams (ie, model trade union teams) can be cultivated in key factories and key workshops, and they can be organized to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team. In these areas, only a joint meeting of team leaders in a workshop or a factory can be convened first to report the experience of advanced teams in order to gradually promote the general. It must be recognized that the Ma Hengchang team competition should become the basic form of the long-term patriotic competition movement, and it should be regarded as a method to improve and persist in the patriotic competition movement, and it should be advanced steadily in a long-term, planned and guided manner.

### 开展抗美援朝的爱国主义运动——纪念“二七”二十八周年  工人日报社论

　　开展抗美援朝的爱国主义运动
    ——纪念“二七”二十八周年   
    工人日报社论
    今天是“二七”流血斗争的二十八周年纪念日。
    “二七”流血斗争的历史意义，就是它的血的事实证明了帝国主义与封建军阀是中国人民的死敌；它标志着当时中国工人阶级在国内的政治生活中，已成了一个独立的政治力量；它显示了中国工人阶级开始以中国革命的领导阶级的姿态，高举着反对帝国主义与封建主义的大旗，昂头阔步地走上了中国的政治舞台。在“二七”大罢工中，中国工人阶级表现了高度的组织性与纪律性。在“二七”大罢工中英勇牺牲的烈士林祥谦、施洋等同志是中国工人阶级战士的典范。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席的领导下，经过了三十年的艰苦英勇斗争之后，已经获得了伟大的具有历史意义和世界意义的胜利。中国人民已经站起来了。美帝国主义（这个世界历史上最大的也是最后的一个帝国主义）这只纸老虎，已被英勇的中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军的刺刀所戳穿。因此，现今世界上的两大阵营——以苏联为首的和平民主阵营与以美国为首的帝国主义阵营——力量的对比，就起了决定性的变化。全世界人民保卫世界和平斗争的力量空前的壮大起来了。全世界那些依靠榨取殖民地人民的血汗为生的帝国主义分子，正陷于恐慌与不安的状态中，日益走向不可挽救的崩溃道路。目前美国帝国主义为了挽救其在朝鲜侵略战争中的惨败，为了恢复与维持其对于中国人民与其他殖民地人民的血腥的反动统治，又在进行单独对日媾和，重新武装日本的阴谋活动，并操纵联合国通过颠倒黑白诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的非法提案，作为他进一步侵略中国与制造世界战争的工具。中国工人阶级，在中国共产党的领导之下，向来就是坚决反对帝国主义的急先锋。我们决不容许美帝国主义重新武装日本，再来屠杀中国人民。我们必须高度警惕起来，保卫中国工人阶级与中国人民的既得利益，保卫祖国的安全，保卫远东和全世界的和平。因此，当我们在纪念“二七”二十八周年的时候，摆在我们中国工人阶级面前的严重任务，首先就是要发扬“二七”中国工人阶级反帝斗争的传统精神，继续开展抗美援朝的爱国运动。
    经过两三个月来的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，广大工人、职员群众不仅树立了仇视、卑视、蔑视美国的正确立场，提高了阶级觉悟，而且在这个基础上，开展了爱国主义生产竞赛；加强和亲密了工人、职员与技术人员之间的团结。但是，工人群众中抗美援朝的爱国宣传工作还发展得很不平衡，还存在着很大的弱点。首先是有许多工会干部，对于这种爱国运动的重大的政治意义与作用，认识的还非常不够。他们以为抗美援朝的宣传工作，对于工人群众似乎没有多大必要，有的还怕进行这种工作会耽误生产。因此，在全国工人、职员群众中进行抗美援朝的爱国教育一般的还不够深入；许多分散的小的厂、矿、企业中的工人（如手工业工人、店员和私营企业的工人职员等），还没有普遍卷进抗美援朝的爱国运动中来；就是已卷入到这一运动中来的厂、矿、企业，宣传工作也很不经常，很不系统。因此，在今年纪念“二七”二十八周年的时候，首要的一个政治任务，就是继续深入地开展抗美援朝的爱国宣传工作，动员每一个工人、职员，都参加到这一伟大的爱国运动中来。必须指出：我们反对美帝国主义的斗争，不是一个短时期的事情，而是一个相当长时期的艰巨的斗争。因此我们对职工群众进行抗美的宣传工作，也不是短时期的，而是长时期的，经常的工作。全国总工会常委扩大会议，已发表宣言，号召全国工人在最近期间，在全国各大城市举行一次反对美国重新武装日本，反对美国操纵联合国大会非法通过诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的提案的游行示威。我们全国工人、职员群众，在各级工会组织的领导下，应当立即加紧准备，加紧抗美援朝的时事学习，积极参加这个伟大的爱国主义运动。
    其次，就是要开展广大工人群众的爱国主义的劳动竞赛。这是工人阶级以自己的实际行动反对侵略，热爱祖国的具体表现。现在，当马恒昌先进生产小组向全国职工提出爱国主义的竞赛挑战后，立刻在全国范围内得到广大职工群众的热烈响应。这表明马恒昌小组竞赛，将使爱国主义的劳动竞赛提高一步，使这个运动更加深入与持久地开展下去。因为，这次竞赛是自下而上的自发的群众运动，是在群众中具有高度的爱国热情的基础上产生的，所以参加竞赛的小组都要经过全体组员民主讨论，根据工作性质和工作岗位提出具体切实的竞赛条件。这些条件就是新劳动态度的具体化，就是最好的爱国公约。这种竞赛就可以成为真正广泛群众的竞赛，而避免那种由于单纯自上而下布置所发生的形式主义的毛病。因此，我们对于目前正在开展的马恒昌小组竞赛，表示热烈地欢迎与支持。我们希望各级工会组织，特别是各城市总工会与市产业工会委员会，要充分重视群众这一自发的竞赛运动的作用，切实地加以组织、指导，使其稳步的向前开展并长久地坚持下去。工会基层组织要具体指导与帮助每一个向马恒昌应战的小组，根据工厂企业的客观需要，订出切实可行的应战条件与小组计划，并帮助他们经常检查自己的工作，克服困难，保证应战条件的实现。要注意选择重点培养那些应战的小组，成为马恒昌式的先进生产小组和模范的工会小组。
    马恒昌小组的特点，首先是打破了技术保守观念，肃清了“保留一手”的行会主义思想残余，这就帮助了全组组员，包括学徒都能加速的进步，完成并超过全组的生产任务。这样也就产生了它的第二个特点，全组组员在生产上，生活上，互相帮助，亲密团结，表现了无产阶级的伟大友爱精神与集体英雄主义，而避免了个人锦标主义的竞赛。它的第三个特点，是高度的劳动热情与钻研技术相结合，以改造生产工具和劳动组织来提高产量与质量，这样就保持了竞赛的持久性，而避免了单纯加强劳动强度的“突击性”所产生的各种恶果。它的第四个特点，就是把全组组员从研究与工作经验中创造出来的办法，变成为经常的制度，如“检查头一个活”，“做套子活”，“负责交班制”，“中午技术研究会”，“每周生产检讨会”等等，这样就使每次得到的成绩都能巩固起来，坚持下去。所以马恒昌小组成了全国先进生产小组的旗帜，它的竞赛方法，也就应当成为劳动竞赛的基本方法。各级工会组织，所有工会干部，从全国总工会的负责干部起，都应当仔细研究马恒昌小组的经验，提高这些经验，并根据这些经验来组织和指导目前正在蓬勃开展的爱国主义的劳动竞赛。
    但是，各地在组织与指导这次劳动竞赛中，应注意各地具体情况的不同，而采取不同的方法和步骤。在生产运动已有经验、工会组织也比较健全的地区，就应更广泛地组织马恒昌小组竞赛运动，使之逐渐扩大，成为整个车间、整个工厂以及工厂与工厂之间的竞赛。在这些地区的城市中，可以在适当时机召开全市参加马恒昌小组竞赛的代表会议，从而交流经验，把劳动竞赛运动与工会基层组织都提高一步。在生产不正常、工会工作发展较迟的新区，就只能先在主要工厂与主要车间中，有重点地培养先进生产小组（即模范的工会小组）的典型，组织他们向马恒昌小组应战。在这些地区就只能先召开一个车间或一个工厂中的小组长联席会议，报告先进小组的经验，来逐渐推动一般。必须认识：马恒昌小组竞赛应该成为长期爱国主义竞赛运动的基本形式，应该把它当成提高与坚持爱国主义竞赛运动的方法，而长期地有计划、有领导地稳步前进。
