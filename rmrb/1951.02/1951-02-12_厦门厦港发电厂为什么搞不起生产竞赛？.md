　　Xiamen Xiagang Power Plant
　　Why Can't a Production Competition Be Started?
    Editor:
    In this enthusiastic nationwide patriotic production competition, our Xiamen Xiagang Power Plant has not been mobilized. The objective reason is, of course, that the plant's original production equipment suffered serious damage from the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents during the liberation of Xiamen; however, it is undeniable that the plant's trade union work has not been done well in the year since liberation. First of all, the trade union's education of workers is very insufficient, and even now most workers do not understand the principle of "workers being masters of their own house." Before production is developed, workers' salary increases cannot be achieved. Trade union cadres have not explained this well, and instead, they negotiate with the administration for salary increases every day. Some basic issues, such as labor insurance and employee benefits, are not actively handled. They even lend welfare funds to workers indiscriminately, which results in those who borrow first getting the money, while those who don't like to borrow casually cannot borrow when they really have difficulties. The trade union usually does very little to promote production work.
    Secondly, the administration has also not paid enough attention to launching the production competition movement. They have not given appropriate criticism or necessary punishment to workers who perform poorly in production; they have also rarely rewarded good workers. They still stubbornly adhere to the old system, and the monthly production plans are only a formality, with the work completely left to drift. We hope that the trade union and administrative leaders of the plant will improve this situation.

### 厦门厦港发电厂为什么搞不起生产竞赛？

　　厦门厦港发电厂
　  为什么搞不起生产竞赛？
    编辑同志：
    在此次全国开展轰轰烈烈的爱国主义生产竞赛中，我们厦门厦港发电厂却没有发动起来。客观原因固然是由于本厂原有生产设备，在厦门解放时遭受美蒋特务的严重破坏；但解放一年多来，厂里的工会工作没做好，也是无可讳言的事实。首先是工会对工人教育很不够，直到现在大部分工人对“工人当家作主”的道理还不清楚。在生产没有发展前，工人加薪是作不到的，工会干部对此没有很好进行解释，反而天天向行政交涉加薪。一些基本问题如劳动保险、职工福利等却不积极去办。甚至把福利基金无原则的乱借给工人，便形成先借的借到了，平时不喜欢乱借的一到真有困难时倒借不到了。工会平时对推动生产的工作是做得很少。
    其次是行政也没有重视开展生产竞赛运动，平时对生产不好的工人没有加以适当的批评或必要的处分；对好的工人也很少加以奖励。至今仍旧死守着老的一套制度，每月生产计划都是形式的，工作完全陷于自流。我们希望该厂工会及行政领导上改善这个情况。
