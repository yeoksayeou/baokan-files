To the Editor:

I have read the letter from Comrade Chen Qingtian in your newspaper's "Reader's Letters" column on the 11th of this month, regarding the Beijing Railway Station's portrait of Chairman Mao not being serious enough and should be revised or repainted. This is an extremely valuable opinion. We intend to ask the artist to modify it immediately.

To the Editor:

Having read Comrade Chen Qingtian's opinion in the "Reader's Letters" column of your newspaper on February 11th: the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging at the Meridian Gate is poorly painted in the face, and it is hoped that the relevant parties will revise or repaint it. We feel this opinion is very valuable, and we sincerely accept it. We have now taken down this portrait and are repainting it.
