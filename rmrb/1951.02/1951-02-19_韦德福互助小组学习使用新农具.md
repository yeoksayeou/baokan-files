    Weidefu Mutual Aid Team Learns to Use New Farm Tools

    Editor:
    Weidefu, a farmer in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, was originally the leader of an agricultural production mutual aid team. Last spring, their mutual aid team received half a set of horse-drawn new farm tools from the county. When the farmers in the Weidefu mutual aid team saw these relatively complex farm tools, they became worried. One old farmer said, "It won't work! If we can't use these things, wouldn't it be a waste!" Weidefu had learned the techniques for using these farm tools in the county, but he wasn't very familiar with them either. He thought that if they didn't know how to use the new farm tools, they would never be able to increase production. Therefore, he was determined to learn the techniques for using these new farm tools well. After several days of exploration and research, he invited all the farmers in the team to watch him use the seed drill to plant soybeans. He first test-planted slowly in the field. The team members said that the soybean seeds were too sparse, and the seedlings would be too thin. So, Weidefu switched to using a faster wheel for planting. He told the team members that at the current speed, there would be eighteen seeds per meter, which was enough. After that, he went to the field to test-plant wheat and corn. After watching several times, the team members saw the benefits of this new seed drill: (1) The seeds could be sown in moist soil, unlike the old plow, where the dry soil had already fallen into the ditch before the seeds could reach it; (2) The sowing was even; (3) With two people and four horses, they could sow six hectares of land a day, which was more labor-saving and efficient than using old farm tools. Therefore, all the farmers in the team began to be interested in the new farm tools.
    When hoeing in the summer last year, the Weidefu team purchased two shovel weeders from the county (one Fumin brand and one Lianhe brand). During weeding, the depth adjustment device malfunctioned, but thanks to Weidefu's dedicated research, he quickly repaired it. The team members were extremely happy, and they slowly learned how to use the shovel weeder themselves. All the team's land was weeded five times. The team members said: These things are really good. Whenever you have free time, you can pull them to the field for a stroll and weed the field once.
    During the autumn harvest, the Weidefu team used a "rear-turning harvester." Initially, it was very inconvenient to turn. Later, after Weidefu's research and experimentation, he modified the drawbar, which made it easier to use.
    Now, the Weidefu team already has a set of new farm tools, including a "double-wheeled one-铧 plow," "seed drill," "harvester," "shovel weeder," and "spike-tooth harrow." All the farmers in the team have also learned from Weidefu the skills to use and repair this set of farm tools. This has created favorable conditions for the team's production increase campaign.

### 韦德福互助小组学习使用新农具

    韦德福互助小组学习使用新农具编辑同志：
    黑龙江省克山县农民韦德福，他原来是一个农业生产互助小组的组长。他们这个互助小组，去年春天从县里领回了半套用马拉的新农具。韦德福互助小组的农民，一看到这些比较复杂的农具就发愁，有一个老农说：“不行吧！用这玩艺儿，要是不能使用，那还不是白搭！”韦德福在县里学过使用这套农具的技术，但也不很熟悉。他想，如果咱们不会使用新农具，永远也不能增加生产，因此，他就下决心一定要学好使用这些新农具的技术。经过他几天的摸索研究，他就把全组的农民都请来看他用播种机种黄豆。他先在场子里用慢轮试播着，组员们说，豆粒太少了，出苗一定太稀。于是，韦德福就改用快轮播种，他告诉组员们说，现在的速度，每一公尺有十八粒种子，足够了。此后，他就到地里试播了小麦和苞米。组员们看了几次后，都看出了这种新播种机的好处：（一）种子能播在湿土上，不像旧犁那样种子落不到沟里干土已经先落下沟了；（二）播的匀称；（三）用两个人、四匹马，一天就能播种六垧地，比起旧农具来，又省力，又省工。于是全组农民开始对新式农具发生了兴趣。
    去年夏锄的时候，韦德福小组又到县里购回两台铲?机（福民号一台、联合号一台），在铲?时，深浅调整器曾发生故障，但是由于韦德福的专心研究，很快就把它修好了。组员们高兴极了，他们自己慢慢也都学会了使用铲?机的技术。全组的地，都铲?到五遍。组员们说：这玩艺真好，有空就可以拉到地里转蹓一下，就铲?一遍。
    在秋收时，韦德福小组使用了“转背收割机”，初用时，拐弯很不方便，后来，经过韦德福的研究与试验，改装了牵引杆，用起来也就方便了。
    现在韦德福小组里已经有了“双轮一铧犁”、“播种机”、“收割机”、“铲?机”及“钉齿耙”等一套新式农具，全组农民，也都跟着韦德福学会了使用与修理这套农具的本领。这样，就为全组的增产运动创造了有利的条件。
