　　Hangu Public and Private Factories
　  Trade Union Rights and Obligations Still Neglected
    Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, public and private factories in Hangu Town have not paid enough attention to the trade union rights and obligations stipulated in the law. In state-owned and public factories, the administration rarely reports its work to trade union committees and members' congresses. When the public-owned Chemical Raw Materials Factory established a three-prevention committee, it actually removed the sign of the trade union committee and painted it over to become the sign of the three-prevention committee. When the trade union held workers' recreational activities and bought a ping-pong table, the administration changed it into a dining table. When the Tianjin District convened a conference on worker-peasant education, it designated the Tianjin Chemical Factory to send two representatives, but the factory emphasized that production was busy and only allowed one to go; the meeting time was originally ten days, but the administration only gave two days off. The jointly owned public-private jute bag factory dismissed employees without going through the trade union. The working hours of the public-owned rice mill reached more than fourteen hours. The trade union representative raised opinions on behalf of the workers, but the factory leader Ba Ziheng said: labor policy is followed only when the production season is busy; then when work is slack, can workers be dispensed with? In private factories, some capitalists have not yet realized the benefits of the labor-capital mutual benefit policy for the development of production, holding an antagonistic attitude towards workers, unwilling to accept the Trade Union Law, and illegally preventing workers from joining the trade union. Some shops call their employees "helpers"; or say they are relatives, staying for a few days and then leaving, in order to prevent them from joining the trade union. The privately owned Chemical Lida Factory emphasized that the factory was small and could not implement the 2% trade union fund stipulated by the Trade Union Law. The above phenomena are indeed due to the factory administration or capitalists not paying enough attention to the Trade Union Law; but at the same time, it also shows that trade union cadres have failed to organize workers well to improve production, have not adhered to a correct position, and have not provided enough education to workers, resulting in the Trade Union Law not being effectively implemented.

### 汉沽公私营工厂  工会权利与义务尚被忽视

　　汉沽公私营工厂
　  工会权利与义务尚被忽视
    自工会法颁布后，汉沽镇公私营工厂对工会法内所规定之工会权利与义务不够重视。在国营、公营工厂行政上很少向工会委员及会员大会报告工作。公营化工原料厂在建立三防委员会时，竟把工会委员会的牌子摘去，涂改为三防委员会的牌子；工会举办工人游艺活动，买了乒乓球桌子，行政上把它改为吃饭桌。天津分区召开工农教育会议，指定天津化学工厂去两名代表，厂方却强调生产忙，只许去一名；会议时间原为十天，行政只给两天假。公私合营麻袋厂解雇职工，不通过工会。公营碾米厂劳动时间，达十四小时以上，工会代表工人提出意见，但该厂领导人巴子恒说：生产季节正忙时按劳动政策；那么工闲时，可以不要工人吗？私营工厂中有些资本家还没有认识到劳资两利政策对发展生产的好处，抱着和工人对立的态度，不愿意接受工会法，非法阻拦工人参加工会，有些商店把店员叫作帮忙的；或者说是亲戚，暂住几天即走，借此阻止加入工会。私营化学利达工厂，强调厂子小，不能执行工会法所规定百分之二的工会经费。以上现象，固然是由于厂方行政或资方对工会法不重视；但同时也说明工会干部未能很好组织工人提高生产，没有坚持正确的立场，对工人教育不够，致使工会法未得切实执行。
