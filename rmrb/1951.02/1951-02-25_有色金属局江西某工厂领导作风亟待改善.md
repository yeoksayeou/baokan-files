    Leadership Style at a Certain Factory in Jiangxi Under the Nonferrous Metals Bureau Urgently Needs Improvement
    The Sankangmiao Factory in a certain county of the Jiangxi Branch of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau suffers from a leadership marked by bureaucracy, resulting in low worker morale and lax labor discipline. After starting work, some workers continue to warm themselves by the brazier. Things that could be finished with one cut on the lathe are done in four or five. Workers also frequently leave ten to twenty minutes early. This seriously hinders production. The factory leadership's bureaucracy is mainly manifested in:
    (1) Administrative cadres are detached from the masses and do not accept workers' suggestions. Last year, Factory Director Zhang, without consulting workers, bought twenty tons of unusable pig iron based on his own subjective opinion. When a 390-horsepower diesel engine at a certain mine needed repair, the factory workers requested to repair it themselves, but the factory director insisted on spending over 70 million yuan to transport it to Shanghai for repair. In the end, the factory workers repaired it themselves. However, since then, the factory director has been very irresponsible regarding production issues, pushing tasks to the trade union's production committee. He also does not review or study engineering drawings, and five lathes have not been completed for over a year due to inaccurate drawings.
    (2) Lack of attention to safety, hygiene, and employee welfare. For example, the clinic has too few doctors, and workers often have to queue for medical treatment. The factory still has no toilets, and workers have to go outside to defecate, wasting production time. The trade union's suggestions are ignored.
    What most affects worker morale is that the bonus for repairing the 390-horsepower diesel engine has not been issued yet. Initially, the administration promised to give a bonus based on the Shanghai repair price; after the repair, the administration said it would give a bonus of 10,000 yuan per worker. But it has not been issued yet, and the workers are very dissatisfied.
    To bring the factory's production back on track, it is hoped that the relevant leading departments can conduct in-depth inspections of the factory's work and help resolve the above issues.

    Editor's Note: The reason why workers at the Sankangmiao Factory have not developed a conscious labor enthusiasm is mainly because the administrative management cadres have not established the idea of relying on workers, do not value workers' opinions, and do not care about workers' welfare and lives. This also illustrates the weakness of the factory's trade union work. The trade union is not good at educating and inspiring workers' awareness and initiative.

    有色金属局江西某工厂领导作风亟待改善
    有色金属管理局江西分局所辖某县三康庙工厂，由于领导上的官僚主义，造成了工人生产情绪低落，劳动纪律松懈。上班后机器开动了，有的工人仍在火盆旁边烤火。车工间本来一刀子可以车好的东西，却用四、五刀车。下班时也经常提早十分至二十分钟。因而严重地妨碍了生产。该厂领导上的官僚主义，主要表现在：
    （一）行政干部脱离群众，不接受工人提的意见。去年张厂长不征求工人意见，凭自己主观意见买了二十吨不能用的生铁。要修复某矿场的一部三九○匹马力的柴油引擎机时，该厂工人要求自己修，厂长却硬要花七千多万元运到上海去修，结果还是该厂工人自己修好了。但从此以后，厂长对生产上的问题却表现得很不负责，来了任务就推给工会生产委员。对工程图样也不审查研究，五部车床作了一年多还没有完工，就是由于图样不精确的缘故。
    （二）不注意安全卫生与职工福利。如医务所医生太少，工人看病经常得排队。工厂至今没厕所，工人大便要跑到门外去，耽误生产时间。工会提意见也不理。
    最影响工人生产情绪的，是修好三九○匹马力柴油机的奖金，至今还没有发下来。当初修理时，行政答应照上海修理的价格给奖；修好后，行政上又说按每一个工一万元给奖。但到现在也没有发下来，工人很不满意。
    为了使该厂生产进入正轨，希望有关领导部门能深入该厂检查工作，帮助解决上述问题。

    编者按：三康庙工厂工人所以没有发扬自觉的劳动热情，主要原因是行政管理干部没有树立依靠工人的思想，不重视工人意见，不关心工人福利和生活。同时也说明了该厂工会工作的薄弱。工会还不善于教育并启发工人的觉悟和积极性。
