The Unmanned Bookstore at Beijing Railway Station
　　Baisheng

　　There are many new things in New China, concretely embodying the characteristics of new social life. The "Beijing Station Unmanned Bookstore" on the first platform of Beijing Qianmen East Railway Station is one example.

　　Beijing Station is the meeting point of several major railway lines from Beijing to Shanghai, to Shenyang, to Hankou, to Baotou. Tens of thousands of passengers enter and exit here every day. Among them are government leaders, workers, farmers, students, university professors, businessmen, and various other people. As long as they pass through here, they can buy the books and newspapers they want from the "Unmanned Bookstore."

　　Before a passenger boards the train, he finds his seat, settles his luggage, but there is still a quarter of an hour before departure, so he comes down and strolls on the platform. At this time, he discovers the "Unmanned Bookstore," which consists of two sloping, yellow-painted wooden bookshelves, each about six feet high and four feet wide, placed on the platform. They are stocked with Chairman Mao's works, other theoretical books, literary books, various new books and magazines, as well as various newspapers published in Beijing that day. He wants to buy some books to read on the journey, but he can't find the owner of the bookstore anywhere. He looks up carefully and sees several large white characters: "Beijing Station Unmanned Bookstore," and a line of large yellow characters: "Take the books yourself! Pay for them yourself!" Below that is a line of small characters: "And sells stamped envelopes and stationery." He is both surprised and delighted. He takes the books and newspapers and puts the payment into the collection box at the bottom corner of the bookshelf according to the price marked on the books. He has some small change left over, so he takes a stamped envelope. At this moment, he sees a pen and ink on the back of the bookshelf. He seals a letter that has not yet been mailed and puts it into the collection box. He also sees a round stamp engraved with "Beijing Station Unmanned Bookstore Commemorative Stamp," and he stamps the commemorative stamp on the books he bought, and then walks back to the carriage.

　　The Beijing Station Unmanned Bookstore has been in existence for a year. It was established on February 1, 1950, four months after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The founder was the Beijing Station Trade Union. They had no funds, only a heart to serve passengers warmly. Their books and magazines are from Xinhua Bookstore, and newspapers are from the post office, all sold on consignment. If a passenger lacks morality and takes a book from the bookshelf without paying, they have to compensate. But in the past year, this has never happened. According to incomplete statistics, from February 1, 1950, to the end of December, a total of 53,520 copies of various books and magazines were sold, collecting 9,054,000 yuan; 10,308 copies of newspapers were sold, collecting 3,522,275 yuan. Sometimes, more than 100,000 yuan can be sold per day. The daily receipts generally match the total value of the books and newspapers sold. Sometimes the amount exceeds the total value of the books and newspapers sold, and sometimes it is slightly less than the total value of the books and newspapers sold, because no one is looking for change or the buyer is short of change. To improve this situation, on the one hand, they let the station's announcer tell passengers that they can go to the station's food sales counter to exchange for change. On the other hand, they sell stamped envelopes and stationery as change chips. They also help passengers mail letters and make phone calls free of charge. If a passenger does not have time to mail a letter or needs to make a phone call before getting on the train, they can put the letter or phone number and name into the collection box of the "Unmanned Bookstore," and they will mail or call it for you.

　　From eight o'clock every morning, the books and newspapers on these two bookshelves are arranged neatly, and they are collected and accounted for at eight o'clock in the evening (ten o'clock in the evening in summer when the days are long). This work is carried out in turn by the families of railway workers—three young female comrades, Wang Dacheng, Zhang Guorong, and Wang Yunzhen—in their spare time.

　　When the "Unmanned Bookstore" at Beijing Station was first established, three of the five executive committee members of the Beijing Station Trade Union disagreed. They believed that doing this in such a complex station was risky. But those who advocated doing it believed that the current society is different from the past, the people's awareness has been raised, and we should try our best to serve the people and cultivate new moral concepts. As a result, everyone agreed to give it a try. On February 1 of last year, before the first train from Beijing to Tianjin had departed, several young comrades from their trade union were busy carrying the prepared books and publications into the platform. At that time, the arrangement was very simple, with only a square table for displaying books and a wooden box for collecting money. They also posted an explanatory advertisement and returned to the trade union office. As soon as the first train left, they couldn't help but run to the platform to take a look. They were extremely excited because in this short period of time, many books had been sold, and the payment was not short. On the first day, they sold 40,000 yuan worth of books and newspapers. The practical experience of this day gave them a profound education.

　　Over the past year, the "Unmanned Bookstore" at Beijing Station has greatly moved many people. They realize that today's society is different from the past. In the new society, the awareness of the broad masses of the people has been generally raised, and new moral concepts have been established. Passengers everywhere are spreading the word about this event. Some passengers wrote letters of opinion, saying: This shows the noble morality of the people of our new democratic New China.

### 北京车站的无人售书处

　　北京车站的无人售书处
　　柏生
    新中国有很多新鲜事物，具体表现了新社会生活的特征。北京前门东车站第一月台上的“北京站无人售书处”，便是一个例子。
    北京站是从北京到上海、到沈阳、到汉口、到包头的几条大铁路干线的汇合点。每天从这里出入的旅客有千千万万。其中有政府首长、有工人、有农民、有学生、有大学教授、有商人以及其他各种各样的人。只要他们从这里经过，他们都可能从“无人售书处”买自己所要的书报。
    一个旅客在开车以前，把坐位找定了，把行李安置好了，但离开车时间还有一刻，他又下来在月台上散步。这时，他发现了“无人售书处”，这是设在月台上的两个约摸六尺高四尺宽的斜坡形黄色油漆的木制书架，上面摆着有毛主席的著作，有其他理论书籍，有文艺书，有各种各样的新书杂志，还有当天北京出版的各种报纸。他要买几本书带到旅途上去看看，但他到处找不到这里卖书的主人。他仔细抬头一看，才看见几个白色大字“北京站无人售书处”，还有一行黄色大字“自己取书！自己付款！”下面还有一行小字：“并代售贴好邮票的信封信纸”。他又惊又喜，他取了书报，照书上的标价把款装进了书架下角的收款箱里。刚好还有一点零头，他又拿了一个贴好邮票的信封。这时他在书架背面看见有笔和墨水，他把一封尚未寄出的信，封好放进款箱里。他又看到一个刻着“北京站无人售书处纪念章”的圆形章，他就在买好的书上盖了一个纪念章，然后走回车厢去。
    北京站无人售书处，已经有一年的历史。它是一九五○年二月一日，即中华人民共和国成立四个月后成立的，创办者是北京站工会。他们没有经费，只有一颗为旅客热情服务的心。他们的书和杂志是新华书店的，报纸是邮局的，都是代售品。如果有一个旅客缺乏道德，从书架上取了书不付款，他们就要赔偿。但是一年来，没有发生过这种事情。据不完全的统计，从一九五○年二月一日至十二月底，共售出各种书籍杂志五万三千五百二十册，收款九百零五万四千元；售出报纸一万零三百零八份，收款三百五十二万二千二百七十五元。每天有时能卖到十余万元。每天的收款数与售出的书报的总值，大致相符，有时款数还超过了售出书报的总值，也有很少时候，款数略少于售出书报的总值，这是因为无人找尾数或买主缺零钱的缘故。为了改进这一情况，他们一方面让车站的广播员告诉旅客，可以到车站的食品出售处去换零钱，一方面又代售贴好邮票的信封和信纸，作为零数的筹码。他们还替旅客义务邮信和打电话。如果有旅客在上火车前来不及发信或需要打电话，就可以把信或电话号码和姓名放进“无人售书处”的收款箱里，他们会替你代寄代打。
    从每天早晨八点钟起，这两个书架上的书报都摆得好好的，到晚上八点钟（夏天天长要到晚上十点）收好算账。这项工作是由铁路职工家属——三个年青的女同志王大成、张国荣、王云珍在业余时间轮流担任的。
    在北京站“无人售书处”开始创办的时候，北京站工会五个执委中就有三个人不同意。他们认为在这样复杂的车站作这种事，那是冒险的。但是主张办的人认为现在的社会已经和过去不同了，人民的觉悟提高了，而且应该想尽一切办法为人民服务，并培养新的道德观念。结果大家都同意试办。在去年二月一日那一天，当第一趟由北京开往天津的火车还未开出前，他们工会的几个年青的同志，便一股劲的忙着把预先准备好的书籍刊物，抬进了月台。当时布置得很简陋，仅有一张摆书的方桌和一个装款的木匣。他们又贴了一张说明广告，便都回到工会办公室里来了。第一趟车刚刚开走，他们便忍不住又跑到月台上去看，这下可兴奋极了，原来这一会功夫，书已经售出不少，书款并不短少。第一天，共卖了四万元的书报。这一天的实际经验，便给了他们深刻的教育。
    一年来，北京站“无人售书处”使许多人受到很大的感动。他们认识到现在的社会是和过去不同了。在新社会里，广大的人民的觉悟已经普遍地提高了，新的道德观念已经建立起来。旅客们到处传颂着这件事，有的旅客写了意见书，说：这表现了我们新民主主义的新中国人民的高尚道德。（附图片）
