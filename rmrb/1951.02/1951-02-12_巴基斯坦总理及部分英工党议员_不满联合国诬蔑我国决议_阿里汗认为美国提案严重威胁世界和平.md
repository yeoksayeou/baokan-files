Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to a United Press report from Karachi: Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan told reporters on the 7th that he agreed with the opinion in the statement by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the United Nations' adoption of the U.S. proposal, believing that the U.S. proposal itself is "a serious threat to world peace." Ali Khan also stated: this proposal has "closed the door" to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He said: "If the United Nations had adopted the Arab-Asian countries' proposal, it might have allowed the issue to be resolved peacefully."

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: The British Labour government's support for the U.S. proposal smearing China in the United Nations has met with increasing opposition from lower-level members of the Labour Party. According to an Agence France-Presse report from London: Twelve Labour MPs, including Hughes and Silverman, submitted a proposal in the House of Commons on the 9th opposing the British government's current policy. The proposal "expresses regret over the United Nations' designation of China as an aggressor, opposes any sanctions against the Chinese government," and "strongly advocates continuing efforts to seek an immediate ceasefire in Korea, with the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops, and the reconstruction of Korea through international action." The proposal "requests the government to take the lead in formulating a policy that can maintain peace between Western countries and the Soviet Union."

    阿里汗认为美国提案严重威胁世界和平
    【新华社十一日讯】据合众社喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦总理阿里汗于七日对记者表示，他同意我国外交部周恩来部长关于联合国通过美国提案的声明中的意见，认为美国提案本身是“对世界和平的严重威胁”。阿里汗并称：这一提案已把和平解决朝鲜问题的“门关上了”。他说：“如果联合国通过了阿拉伯亚洲各国提案，它可能使得该问题获得和平解决。”
    【新华社十一日讯】英国工党政府在联合国内支持诬蔑我国的美国提案，已遭到工党下层党员们日益加强的反对。据法新社伦敦消息透露：十二个工党议员包括休士和锡尔佛曼在内，于九日在下院中提出一项提案，反对英国政府现行政策。该提案“对联合国指认中国为侵略者表示遗憾，对任何对于中国政府的制裁表示反对”，并“力主继续努力求得在朝鲜立即停火，并同时撤退一切外国军队，通过国际行动复兴朝鲜”。该提案“要求政府率先制订一种能保持西方国家与苏联间的和平政策”。
