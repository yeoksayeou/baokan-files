　　Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held continuous meetings on the mornings, afternoons, and evenings of January 30th to continue discussing the Korean issue.

　　During the morning session, Polish representative Katz-Suchy requested a recess until the morning of January 31st, as he had not yet received instructions from his government regarding the revised twelve-nation proposal, which was only submitted to the Political Committee on January 29th. Soviet representative Tsarapkin and Czechoslovak representative Nosek supported this proposal. However, under the intimidation of the U.S. delegation, the majority of the Political Committee rejected this proposal by a vote of 32 against, 10 in favor, and 12 abstentions.

　　After the vote, Katz-Suchy delivered a speech, denouncing the U.S. proposal as a tool for expanding the war in the Far East. He pointed out that Austin's speech to the Political Committee on January 27th fully confirmed this point. During the debate on January 29th, a very pertinent question was raised: if the U.S. truly wanted to resolve the issue peacefully, then why was it necessary to first accuse the People's Republic of China of "aggression" and second to study collective measures? Katz-Suchy cited facts to prove the U.S.'s aggressive intentions. He also mentioned recent remarks made by U.S. representative Gross, who opposed the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations and affirmed that the U.S. would discuss the Taiwan issue "from the viewpoint of U.S. national security." Katz-Suchy emphasized that the possibility of a peaceful resolution was greater than ever. He called on member states of the Political Committee to bravely oppose the U.S. proposal.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin delivered a speech at the beginning of the afternoon session. He pointed out that the U.S.'s proposal to condemn the People's Republic of China finally revealed that the U.S. was against a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Far Eastern issues. Tsarapkin elaborated on the various provisions in the U.S. proposal and specifically demonstrated that this proposal was intended to expand the war in the Far East, thereby precluding a peaceful resolution. The people of the world knew this, and they would not be deceived by the U.S.'s distortions.

　　Tsarapkin recalled that Egyptian representative Fawzi had said that the proposers of the twelve-nation proposal had the support of 600 million people. Tsarapkin said that this number should also include the 475 million people of China, the 300 million people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and the hundreds of millions of people in countries where governments did not reflect the will of the people. That is to say, the people around the world are demanding a peaceful resolution.

　　Tsarapkin said that the Soviet delegation had long pointed out that it would vote against the U.S. proposal and against all amendments to the U.S. proposal. All those who vote in favor of the U.S. proposal must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action.

　　Regarding the twelve-nation proposal, Tsarapkin pointed out that because it did not include a series of important issues, the Soviet delegation had already pointed out some of the shortcomings of this proposal. And the proposal added a new provision on ceasefire first, which makes it even less satisfactory than before. Therefore, the Soviet Union proposed an amendment to replace this modification, which stipulates that as the first step to achieve this goal, the above-mentioned seven representatives should reach an agreement on appropriate arrangements for a temporary ceasefire in Korea during their first meeting. After this measure is implemented, the seven representatives should proceed to the second step, that is to say, they should study appropriate measures and methods for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, suggest to the Korean people ways and methods for the Korean people to freely resolve their internal affairs, and withdraw U.S. armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, and issues related to the Far East.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi requested to speak on procedural matters, saying that he needed 24 hours to await instructions from his government regarding the new Soviet amendment. He went on to say that he asked Indian representative Rau to provide more detailed information on the attitude of the Chinese government.

　　Rau then spoke. Rau said that in addition to what he said on January 29th, he could provide the Political Committee with information that the Indian government received from "senior figures in Beijing" on January 28th. Rau said that on January 29th, he did not think it was necessary to present this information, but he now accepted the Egyptian representative's request and presented this information. Rau went on to say that the Indian government was notified on January 26th that Beijing believed the twelve-nation proposal was a sincere effort for peace. Rau also said that the Indian government believed that based on the twelve-nation proposal, the People's Republic of China would be willing to cooperate and engage in negotiations for a peaceful resolution. The Indian government was notified that because the Chinese government hopes for peace and respects those countries in the United Nations that sincerely hope for a peaceful resolution, the People's Republic of China has agreed to decide on the issue of a ceasefire at the first meeting of the seven-nation conference. Rau continued, saying that the Indian government was notified that this was Beijing's true effort for peace and requested the Indian government to convey this meaning to all countries.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi then emphasized the importance and timeliness of Rau's statement and urged the Political Committee to conduct the most careful study of the information presented by the Indian representative. He also said that the Soviet amendment was another reason to avoid dangerous hasty action. Then, Canadian representative Pearson declared that he was willing to vote in favor of the U.S. proposal and would abstain from the twelve-nation proposal. British representative Jebb also spoke in the same spirit. Jebb insisted that negotiating under the U.S. proposal was better than any seven-nation conference.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin then raised a procedural issue - protesting the disregard for the Soviet amendment and requesting the Political Committee to give the representatives an opportunity to study the amendment in accordance with customary practice. Chairman U Thant inquired whether Tsarapkin proposed delaying the discussion. Tsarapkin replied that he had not made any proposal, but merely reminded the chairman of the provisions in the rules of procedure: new amendments must be discussed 24 hours later. Chairman U Thant attempted to defend the trick he played for the U.S. delegation, insisting that he had concluded the debate. Tsarapkin immediately pointed out that he had given the draft of the amendment to the chairman's assistant before the meeting started. Therefore, the chairman must have known that the amendment would cause discussion, so the chairman had no right to declare the debate closed.

　　Turkish representative Sarper formally proposed that the Political Committee vote on the proposals. U Thant then played a new trick, attempting to immediately put the U.S. proposal to a vote. He stated that if the Political Committee decided to vote on the U.S. proposal first, then the "difficulties" caused by the submission of the Soviet amendment could be avoided. The U.S. proposal could be put to a vote today, and the twelve-nation proposal could be put to a vote tomorrow.

　　However, Iraqi representative Jamali reminded the chairman that there was no doubt that the twelve-nation proposal should be voted on first. And U.S. representative Austin suggested that the chairman continue as he had before being "interrupted."

　　Lebanese representative Malik said that the Soviet representative's insistence on debating his amendment was undoubtedly justified. He also said that the only question was whether to hold the debate today or tomorrow.

　　Tsarapkin said that the question of whether to discuss the Soviet amendment could not be put to a vote, because the Soviet delegation had the right to request a discussion of its amendment, and this right could not be deprived. If the Turkish and U.S. representatives attempted to implement the U.S. proposal to expand the conflict, that was their business; but they could not deprive the Soviet delegation of its rights.

　　The representatives of Poland, Syria, Egypt, and India also opposed the chairman's attempt to immediately put the U.S. proposal to a vote. Indian representative Rau pointed out that Austin admitted that the twelve-nation proposal should be voted on first. Time should be given to consider the amendment, which was unquestionable, and the Norwegian representative also supported the Soviet position.

　　U.S. representative Austin claimed that the U.S. did not recognize that the twelve-nation proposal had priority, but only agreed not to raise the issue of priority during the recess of the meeting. He believed that both proposals should be put to a vote at this meeting. He said that the U.S. did not deny the Soviet Union's right to discuss its amendment, but he insisted that the Soviet Union was attempting to "conduct a forced discussion." Austin said that if the Political Committee decided to postpone the vote on the twelve-nation proposal until January 31st, then the U.S. would raise the issue of priority and "insist" on voting on the U.S. proposal today, even if it meant the meeting continued until midnight.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin said that if the representatives did not get sufficient time to study the Soviet amendment, this was in fact a refusal of the right to discuss this amendment. Therefore, the Soviet representative requested the chairman to ensure sufficient time for discussion in accordance with the rules of procedure and normal procedures.

　　British representative Jebb said that time should be given to discuss the Soviet amendment, and there should be a short recess for consultations between Asian and Arab countries. Jebb said that in the evening, the Political Committee should first vote on the twelve-nation proposal and then vote on the U.S. proposal.

　　Chairman U Thant then announced that he would proceed with the vote, starting with the Soviet amendment. He said that the representatives would be able to explain their attitude towards the amendment "when they explain their reasons for voting." Although Tsarapkin firmly insisted that the amendment should be fully discussed in accordance with the rules, the chairman arbitrarily put the Turkish representative's proposal to end the debate to a vote, which was passed by 36 votes to 17, with 5 abstentions. The Soviet representative protested this illegal decision of the Political Committee.

　　After several representatives explained their reasons for voting, the afternoon session adjourned.

　　At the evening session, U Thant said at the beginning of the meeting that it was necessary to vote on the amendment proposed by the Soviet delegation.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi declared that after the Political Committee decided to vote on the amendment tonight, despite the opposition of the Asian Group, the Asian Group held a meeting and decided that because they did not have enough time to obtain instructions, they could not participate in the vote on the Soviet amendment. The Political Committee then rejected the Soviet amendment by a vote of 38 to 5, with 6 abstentions. Asian countries did not participate in the vote.

　　Tsarapkin spoke, expressing great regret that the amendment had been rejected. He said that since the Soviet delegation still wanted to try to improve the twelve-nation proposal, he suggested the following amendment to the proposal: At the first meeting, the seven countries should reach an agreement on an appropriate "temporary ceasefire" - that is, to insert the word "temporary" in the last sentence of Section 5 of the twelve-nation proposal regarding arrangements for a ceasefire.

　　Indian representative Rau said that he could not participate in the vote on this amendment, but he reserved his attitude when voting in the General Assembly.

　　The Political Committee rejected the second Soviet amendment by a vote of 33 to 5 (with 8 abstentions). Subsequently, another Soviet amendment was rejected by a vote of 42 to 5 (with 12 abstentions), namely deleting the phrase "Intervention of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in Korea" from the title of the twelve-nation proposal. Finally, the Political Committee rejected the fourth Soviet amendment by a vote of 35 to 5 (with 18 abstentions), which stipulated that the preparatory work for the seven-nation conference must be completed with the consent of all participating countries.

　　Indian representative Rau said that he wanted to record the phrase "we have done our best." He reminded everyone that the failure of the Asian countries' proposal would mean the continuation of the conflict in the Far East.

　　The Political Committee then rejected the clause in the twelve-nation proposal limiting the convening of the seven-nation conference by a vote of 27 to 18 (with 14 abstentions). At the request of Soviet representative Tsarapkin, the committee voted separately on the part of the clause that stipulated that the first step of the conference was to arrange an appropriate ceasefire. The Political Committee rejected this part by a vote of 32 to 14 (with 14 abstentions). Finally, the Political Committee rejected the remaining parts of the proposal by a vote of 28 to 17 (with 13 abstentions).

　　The chairman then requested a vote on the U.S. proposal as amended by Lebanon. Thus, the Political Committee passed the first seven sections of the U.S. proposal, including Lebanon's amendment to the second section, by a vote of 44 to 7 (with 7 abstentions). British representative Jebb said that if Lebanon's amendment to Section 8 was not accepted, Britain would have to vote against the entire proposal (Section 8 stipulates the study of collective measures).

　　After Jebb spoke, Austin continued, saying that the U.S. had accepted Lebanon's amendment.

　　Finally, the Political Committee passed the entire U.S. proposal as amended by Lebanon by a roll-call vote of 44 to 7 (with 8 abstentions). The countries voting against the proposal were: Burma, Byelorussian SSR, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland, Ukrainian SSR, and the Soviet Union. The countries abstaining were: Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sweden, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin said that the Political Committee seemed to have completed the review of one agenda item. But there were two other agenda items to be reviewed: the case of accusing the U.S. of aggression against China and the Taiwan issue. Tsarapkin said that the Soviet representative firmly insisted on a swift review of these two agenda items and asked the chairman to state when the review would begin. The chairman replied that he would notify the representatives of when the Political Committee would meet again "at the appropriate time." The chairman then announced the adjournment of the meeting.

　　联大政委会在美国横施压力下
    非法通过美国对我诬蔑提案     
    阿剌伯及亚洲十二国提案与苏联修正案竟被否决
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于一月三十日上午、下午、晚间连续举行会议，继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    在上午会议上，波兰代表卡茨·苏琪要求休会至一月三十一日上午再开，因为他还没有接到他的政府关于修改后的十二国提案的训令，这个提案是一月二十九日才提交政治委员会的。苏联代表查拉普金和捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克支持这个提议。但是政委会的多数在美国代表团的威吓下，以三十二票反对、十票赞成、十二票弃权否决了这一提议。
    卡茨·苏琪在表决后发表演说，斥责美国提案是在远东扩大战争的工具。他指出：奥斯汀一月二十七日在政治委员会上的演说完全证实了这点。在一月二十九日会议的辩论中曾经提出了一个非常恰当的问题，那就是如果美国真正是要以和平的方式解决问题的话，那末为什么必须要第一控诉中华人民共和国为“侵略者”，第二研究集体措施呢？卡茨·苏琪引证事实证明美国的侵略目的。他还提出美国代表葛罗斯最近发表的言论，其中反对联合国接纳中华人民共和国，并肯定说美国将“从美国国家安全的观点”来讨论台湾问题。卡茨·苏琪强调指出目前和平解决的可能性比任何时候都大。他号召政治委员会会员国勇敢地反对美国提案。
    苏联代表查拉普金在下午会议开始时发表演说。他指出：美国提出它的谴责中华人民共和国的提案，终于暴露出美国是反对和平解决朝鲜问题和其他远东问题的。查拉普金详细论述美国提案中的各项规定，并具体地证明这个提案是用来扩大远东的战争的，因而杜绝了和平解决。世界各国的人民是知道这一点的，他们是不会被美国的歪曲所迷惑的。
    查拉普金回忆道：埃及代表法齐曾经说过，十二国提案的提案者有着六亿人民的支持。查拉普金说：这个数目还应该加上中国的四亿七千五百万人民，苏联和人民民主国家的三亿人民以及那些政府不能反映人民意志的国家内的数亿人民。这就是说，世界各地的人民是要求和平解决的。
    查拉普金说：苏联代表团早已指出，它将投票反对美国提案，并反对对美国提案的一切的修正案。所有投票赞成美国提案的人都要对这种行动的后果负严重的责任。
    关于十二国提案，查拉普金指出，由于它没有包含一系列的重要问题，因此苏联代表团已经指出过这个提案的若干缺点。而该提案又添进了一项关于首先停火的新规定，这种修改使它比以前更不能令人满意。因此苏联提出修正案以代替这种修改，修正案规定：作为达到这种目的的第一步，上述七国代表应在他们的第一次会议中在适当安排朝鲜临时停火方面获致协议。在这种措置付诸实施以后，七国代表应当进行第二步，那就是说，他们应当研究一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的适当措置和方法、向朝鲜人民建议由朝鲜人民自己自由地解决他们的内政的方式和方法、遵照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告自台湾和台湾海峡撤退美国武装部队问题、以及有关远东的问题。
    埃及代表法齐要求就议事进程发言，他说，他需要二十四小时以等待他的政府关于苏联的新修正案的训令。他接着说，他要求印度代表劳氏供给关于中国政府的态度方面的更详细的情报。
    接着劳氏发言。劳氏说，除了他在一月二十九日说的以外，他可以把印度政府一月二十八日得自“北京高级人士”的情报提给政治委员会。劳氏说，在一月二十九日那天，他并不认为有必要提出这种情报，他现在接受埃及代表的请求而提出这种情报。劳氏接着说：印度政府一月二十六日得到通知说，北京方面认为十二国提案是真诚的和平努力。劳氏又说，印度政府相信根据十二国提案，中华人民共和国会愿意合作，从事和平解决的谈判。印度政府得到通知说，因为中国政府希望和平，并且尊重联合国中那些真诚希望和平解决的国家，中华人民共和国已经同意在七国会议的第一次会议时即决定停火问题。劳氏继称，印度政府得到通知说，这是北京政府真正的和平努力，并且要求印度政府将这个意思转达所有的国家。
    埃及代表法齐接着强调指出劳氏声明的重要性与适时性，并力劝政委会对印度代表所提出的情报作最仔细的研究。他又说：苏联的修正案是应避免作危险的匆促行动的另一原因。然后加拿大代表皮尔逊宣称，他愿意投票赞成美国的提案，而对于十二国提案将弃权。英代表杰伯也以同样精神发言。杰伯硬说，根据美国提案进行谈判，较任何七国会议都更好。
    苏联代表查拉普金于是提出议事进程的问题——对苏联修正案的被漠视提出抗议，并要求政委会遵照惯例给代表们以研究修正案的机会。主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹问查拉普金是否提议延迟讨论。查拉普金回答说，他并未提出任何提议，仅仅是提醒主席注意议事规则上面的规定：必须在二十四小时之后再讨论新的修正案。主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹企图辩护他为美国代表团而玩弄的诡计，他硬说他已结束辩论。查拉普金当即指出：他在会议未开始前已将修正案的草案交给主席的助手。所以，主席一定已经知道修正案会引起讨论，因此主席没有权力宣布辩论已经结束。
    土耳其代表沙贝正式提议政委会表决提案。乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹于是玩弄新的诡计，企图将美国提案立即付诸表决。他表示：如果政委会决定优先表决美国提案，那么由于苏联修正案的提出而引起的“困难”就可以避免。美国提案可以在今天付诸表决，十二国提案可以在明天付诸表决。
    但是，伊拉克代表贾马利提醒主席说，毫无疑问，十二国提案应该优先表决。而美国代表奥斯汀则建议主席照他去被“打断”前所做的那样继续下去。
    黎巴嫩代表麦里克说：苏联代表坚持要对他的修正案举行辩论，无疑是正当的。他又说：唯一的问题是在今天还是在明天举行辩论。
    查拉普金说，是否讨论苏联修正案的问题是不能付诸表决的，因为苏联代表团有权要求讨论它的修正案，而这权利是不能剥夺的。如果土耳其和美国代表企图施行通过扩大冲突的美国提案，那是他们的事；但是他们不能剥夺苏联代表团的权利。
    波兰、叙利亚、埃及及印度代表也反对主席想将美国提案立即付诸表决的企图。印度代表劳氏指出：奥斯汀承认十二国提案应先付诸表决。为了考虑修正案应该给人以时间，这是毫无问题的，挪威代表也支持苏联的立场。
    美国代表奥斯汀声称：美国并不承认十二国提案有优先权，而仅仅是同意在会议的间歇期间不提出优先权的问题，他认为这两个提案都应该在这次会议上付诸表决。他说，美国不否认苏联有讨论它的修正案的权利，但他硬说苏联是企图“进行强制讨论”。奥斯汀说，如果政委会决定把十二国提案延至一月三十一日表决，那么美国将提出优先权的问题，并“坚持”今日就表决美国提案，即使使会议开到午夜。
    苏联代表查拉普金说，如果代表们得不到充足的时间来研究苏联的修正案，这事实上就是拒绝讨论这个修正案的权利。因此，苏联代表要求主席依照议事规则和正常程序保证有充足的时间进行讨论。
    英国代表杰伯说，应给予时间来讨论苏联修正案，并且应有一个短暂的休会时间，以便亚洲和阿剌伯国家间进行商谈。杰伯说：到晚间，政委会应首先表决十二国提案，然后表决美国提案。
    主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹随即宣布：他将进行表决，以苏联的修正案开始。他说，代表们“在他们解释投票理由时”便能够说明他们对修正案的态度。虽然查拉普金坚决主张依照规则应该对修正案进行充分的讨论，但是主席专断地将土耳其代表所提的结束辩论的提议付诸表决，结果以三十六票对十七票通过，五票弃权。苏联代表抗议政委会这个非法的决定。
    在若干代表解释投票理由后，下午会议即告休会。
    在晚间会议上，乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹在会议开始时说，需要对苏联代表团所提出的修正案进行表决了。
    埃及代表法齐宣称，在政委会不顾亚洲集团的反对，决定今晚表决修正案以后，亚洲集团曾举行会议，并且决定因为它们没有足够时间获得训令，它们不能参加苏联修正案的表决。政委会随即以三十八票对五票否决了苏联的修正案，六票弃权，亚洲国家没有参加表决。
    查拉普金发言表示，对修正案遭到否决，甚为遗憾。他说，由于苏联代表团仍然要设法改善十二国提案，他建议该提案作如下的修正：七国在第一次会议上，应就适当的“临时停火”取得协议——这就是在十二国提案第五节最后一句关于安排停火的规定中插入“临时”二字。
    印度代表劳氏说：他不能参加这个修正案的表决，但他保留他在全体大会上表决时采取的态度。
    政委会以三十三票对五票（八票弃权）否决了苏联的第二个修正案。随后，并以四十二票对五票（十二票弃权）否决了苏联的另一项修正案，即删去十二国提案的标题中“中华人民共和国中央人民政府在朝鲜的干涉”一语。最后，政委会又以三十五票对五票（十八票弃权）否决了苏联第四个修正案，这个修正案规定七国会议的准备工作，必须在各参与国的同意下完成。
    印度代表劳氏说：他要把“我们尽了我们最大的努力”一语记录在案。他提醒大家：亚洲各国提案的失败将意味着远东冲突的继续。
    政委会接着以二十七票对十八票（十四票弃权）否决了十二国提案中限定召开七国会议的条款。在苏联代表查拉普金的要求下，委员会把该条款中规定会议的第一步是安排适当的停火的部分单独表决。政委会以三十二票对十四票（十四票弃权）否决了这一部分。最后，政委会以二十八票对十七票（十三票弃权）否决了提案中的其余部分。
    主席接着要求表决经黎巴嫩修正过的美国提案。于是，政委会以四十四票对七票（七票弃权）通过了美国提案中的前七节，包括黎巴嫩对第二节的修正案。英国代表杰伯说：如果黎巴嫩对第八节的修正案不被接受的话，英国就不得不投票反对整个提案（按第八节规定研究集体措施）。
    在杰伯发言以后，奥斯汀接着说：美国已接受黎巴嫩的修正案。
    最后政委会用唱名表决办法以四十四票对七票（八票弃权）通过经黎巴嫩修正过的整个美国提案。投票反对该提案的国家为：缅甸、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、波兰、乌克兰和苏联，弃权的国家为：阿富汗、埃及、印尼、巴基斯坦、瑞典、叙利亚、也门和南斯拉夫。
    苏联代表查拉普金说：政委会似乎已完成一项议程的审议。但是还有另外两项议程尚待审议，一项是控诉美国侵略中国案，一项是台湾问题。查拉普金说，苏联代表坚决主张迅速审议这两项议程，并要主席说明何时开始审议。主席回答说：他将“在适当的时间”通知各代表政委会何时再开会。主席接着宣布休会。
