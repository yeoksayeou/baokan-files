　　Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: The United States is continuing to provide military aid to the French forces invading Vietnam. According to the Paris newspaper *Ce Soir* quoted by TASS, the U.S. aircraft carrier *Windham Bay* arrived in Saigon on February 1. The ship carried forty-eight fighter planes and a large quantity of aircraft parts. This is part of the U.S. military aid stipulated in the U.S.-French military agreement concluded during the recent Truman-Plevin talks. Currently, the total number of American aircraft in Indochina has reached one hundred and twenty-six. Accompanying the ship to Saigon were four hundred and thirteen American officers and technicians.
    
　　According to *L'Humanité* in Paris, the arrival of the *Windham Bay* in Saigon has aroused a wave of angry protests from the working people of Saigon. Although the French colonial authorities and the puppet Bảo Đại had ordered a city-wide alert, five hours after the ship arrived in Saigon, Saigon patriots threw four hand grenades into a cafe where American sailors were relaxing. Hand grenades were also thrown two hundred meters away from the *Windham Bay*. U.S. military authorities had to order the American sailors who had gone ashore to "all return to the ship."

　　美帝援法侵越飞机运抵西贡
    西贡人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社八日讯】美国正继续以军火援助侵越法军。据塔斯社引巴黎《今晚报》消息：美国航空母舰“温德罕湾”号已于二月一日驶抵西贡。该舰载有四十八架战斗机及大量飞机零件。这是最近杜鲁门和普利文会谈时缔结的美法军事协定中规定的美国军事援助的一部分。目前，在印度支那的美国飞机总数已达一百二十六架。随该舰到西贡的，还有美国军官和技师四百一十三人。
    巴黎《人道报》消息：“温德罕湾”号的抵达西贡，已引起西贡劳动人民的抗议怒潮。虽然法国殖民当局和傀儡保大曾下令全城警戒，但在该舰到达西贡后五小时，西贡的爱国分子即向美国水兵们正在取乐的咖啡店里投了四枚手榴弹。手榴弹还掷在距“温德罕湾”号只有二百米远的地方。美军当局不得不下令叫上岸的美国水兵“全部回舰”。
