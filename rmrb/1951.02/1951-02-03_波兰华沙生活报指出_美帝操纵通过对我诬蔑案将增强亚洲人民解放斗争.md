Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, February 2nd: Regarding the United Nations General Assembly passing the US provocative proposal condemning the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" under US pressure, the Warsaw Life Daily published an article titled "The 'Voting Machine' and the Will of the People," which stated: "Regardless of the opposition from the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries, regardless of the warning from Indian representative Rau that passing the US proposal would block the path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the US 'voting machine' has been activated once again. The satellite countries of the murderers of the Korean nation have declared the great Chinese nation, which stood up to aid the Korean people and engaged in self-defensive resistance against the US aggressors, as 'aggressors.' The Wall Street mass murderers have once again written a shameful page in their history of tarnished reputation under the name of the United Nations." The newspaper concluded: The US aggressors' repeated activation of the "voting machine" to pass yet another illegal proposal will help strengthen the unity of the forces opposing the imperialist camp and will strengthen the liberation struggle of the people of Asian countries.
