　　Emphasize the Preservation of Historical Sites and Cultural Relics
　　Baiquan in Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, is a famous scenic spot in northern Henan. Not only is the spring water famous, but there are also many historical sites on Mount Sumen. Xiaotai, where Sun Deng of the Jin Dynasty lived in seclusion, and Anlewo, the former residence of Shao Kangjie of the Song Dynasty, are both located here. There are also many inscriptions by famous people of past dynasties, which are precious legacies of our historical culture. Last December, the Xinxiang City Private Xijiang Construction Factory contracted to build public housing there. The Huixian County People's Government sent cadres to contact them to pay attention to protecting the historical sites. However, Gu Guoan, the supervisor of the factory, ignored this, causing damage to some of the historical sites. When the county government discovered it, the front pavilion of Mount Sumen and twelve ancient steles (including: two large cursive script steles by Huang Hui of the Song Dynasty, two cursive script steles by Lü Bangyao, two cursive script steles by Zhao Pengfei, and the Zhang Bangjun stele of the Qing Dynasty, etc.) had been demolished. The Meiliang Temple and Xiaotai were also demolished, and many other less famous historical sites were also destroyed. The County People's Government has now detained the supervisor, Gu Guoan, for legal action.

　　In the Shijing Mountain Stone Bell Temple in Jianchuan County, Yunnan, there are ten stone carvings of Brahman gods and many stone sparrows, carved exquisitely and delicately. Locals call them "Fairy Carvings." According to research, these stone carvings are relics of the Tang Dynasty Nanzhao Kingdom, dating back nine centuries. It is said that they were carved by craftsmen from the Nanzhao royal palace, representing the artistic creation of the working people of China in the Tang Dynasty. However, since liberation, no one has been responsible for the preservation of these valuable historical relics, resulting in the collapse of the temple and the stone carvings being exposed to the wind and rain. I suggest that the local People's Government, in conjunction with the local people, quickly preserve these cultural relics.

　　Editor's note: The letters from readers Chen Daming and Chao Han illustrate that the work of protecting historical relics and ancient sites should further arouse the attention of local People's Governments and the masses. As early as last May, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Measures for the Protection of Ancient Sites, Precious Cultural Relics, Books, and Rare Organisms," which stipulated that the cultural and educational departments and public security organs of local People's Governments should properly protect local historical relics and ancient sites. However, the People's Government of Jianchuan County, Yunnan Province, has not yet paid attention to this point. Although the People's Government of Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, had instructed the construction workers who were building houses in the scenic area beforehand and took legal action afterward, in reality, they did not take effective measures to protect the precious cultural heritage of the motherland, so it was ultimately damaged.

### 重视古迹文物保管

　　重视古迹文物保管
    平原省辉县百泉是豫北的名胜，不但泉水著名，该处苏门山的古迹亦甚多。晋朝孙登隐居的啸台和宋朝邵康节的故居安乐窝都在这里，并且有历代名人颂书刻石多块，这些都是我国历史文化的珍贵遗产。去年十二月，新乡市私营锡江营造厂在那里承盖公房，辉县人民政府为保护古迹曾派干部前往接洽请其注意，但该厂监工人员顾国安对此置若未闻，致使部分古迹遭受破坏。县人民政府发觉时，已拆坏苏门山前亭子及古碑十二块（包括：宋朝黄辉大草碑二块，吕邦耀草书二块，赵鹏飞草书二块及清朝张邦俊碑等），没梁庙及啸台也被拆毁了，其他不甚著名的古迹也毁坏了不少。现县人民政府已将监工员顾国安扣押法办。

    云南剑川县石镜山石钟寺内，有石刻的婆罗门神像十座及很多石雀，刻得精致细巧。当地人称之为“仙刻”。据考查，这些石刻是唐代南铭国的遗物，距今已有九世纪。相传这是南铭王宫里的匠人刻的，它代表着唐代中国劳动人民的艺术创造。但是解放后至今，对这些宝贵的历史文物却无人负责保管，以致寺庙倒塌，石刻任凭风吹雨打。我建议当地人民政府结合当地群众迅速将这些文物保管起来。
                                                       陈大鸣
    编者按：读者陈大鸣、超韩的来信说明，保护历史文物、古迹的工作应进一步引起各地人民政府及群众的注意。早在去年五月中央人民政府政务院所颁布的关于古迹、珍贵文物图书及稀有生物保护办法中，即已规定各地方人民政府文教部门及公安机关对本地的历史文物、古迹应妥为保护。而云南省剑川县人民政府至今未重视此点。平原省辉县人民政府对在名胜地区修盖房屋的施工人员，虽事先交待，事后法办，但实际上他们并未采取有效的办法来保护祖国宝贵的文化遗产，所以终归遭到了破坏。
