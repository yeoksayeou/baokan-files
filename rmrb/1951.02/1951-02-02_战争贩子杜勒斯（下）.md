War-Monger Dulles (Part 2)
　　Wen Sheng

　　Dulles's reactionary activities in the international arena are indeed a result of his upbringing from a young age. His maternal grandfather, Foster, boasted in his "Diplomatic Memoirs" about his "achievements" in assisting Japanese imperialism in seizing Taiwan in 1895 as an advisor to the corrupt Qing government. According to his own account, Li Hongzhang felt extremely distressed about the issue of selling out Taiwan, because Li Hongzhang told him that, according to Chinese custom, whoever was responsible for ceding territory had to go to the territory in person to handle the handover. However, in view of the strong opposition from the people of Taiwan, he dared not go to Taiwan. This imperialist advisor then came up with a "brilliant plan" for Li Hongzhang, telling him to adopt the "common practice of Western countries" and hand over the land deed of Taiwan to Japan, without having to go to Taiwan to handle the handover himself. "In this way," Foster said triumphantly, "Li Hongzhang and his son handed over Taiwan to Japan on a Japanese flagship in the port of Tamsui." Foster's "Diplomatic Memoirs," according to the American "Who's Who in Modern America" published in 1944, was Dulles's favorite book to read throughout his life. At the same time, his grandfather's life story was his "ideological teacher."

　　Because Foster was "meritorious" in assisting in the sale of Taiwan, in 1907, during the Hague Conference, the corrupt Qing government again hired him as an advisor to the Chinese delegation. Dulles, who was only nineteen years old at the time and had not yet graduated from college, was made the secretary of the Qing government delegation through the promotion of his grandfather. Since then, he has become a prominent figure in the international arena for the American reactionaries. In 1917, he was sent by US President Wilson as a special representative of the State Department to engage in activities in Central America, plotting to undermine the independence movements of various countries and intensify economic exploitation of them. During the First World War, he was appointed as an army lieutenant and soon promoted to major. In 1918, he became the assistant to the director of the US wartime trade bureau. After the end of the First World War, he was appointed as an advisor to the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and later went to Germany to serve as the American member of the reparations committee. Since the Second World War, he has participated in all important international conferences.

　　However, the positions he held were all appointed by the US government, and never elected by the people. He only once allowed the American people to decide his political position, which was in November 1949 when he ran for US Senator for New York State, but this time he suffered a decisive and painful blow from the voters of New York State and failed. However, although this war-monger was resolutely rejected by the American voters and not elected as a senator, Truman appointed him as the US representative to the United Nations immediately after his election defeat, and soon appointed him as a senior advisor to the State Department, continuing to preside over the reactionary foreign policy of the United States.

　　Domestically, in the United States, Dulles, who is called a "trustee with a robber philosophy" by American progressives, appears as a "religious leader." All his conspiracies and malicious schemes of aggression are cloaked in the guise of "maintaining Christian culture." He is an important figure in the American Christian Association, and through the association's Justice and Lasting Peace Committee, he mobilizes the religious forces in the United States, using churches and reactionary pastors to promote his aggressionism in order to deceive and numb the American people. At the same time, he colludes with fascists such as Luce, who mobilizes his publications to promote Dulles as the "world's greatest religious leader," a "compassionate heart," and "defending their civilization for God's children suffering from disasters."

　　Indeed, Dulles has a "compassionate heart" for the fascist bandits. In 1939, he wrote a book entitled "War, Peace, and Change," opposing sanctions against the German-Italian-Japanese fascist axis. He said: "Even if there is a practical need, but if we put shackles on vital people (i.e., the German-Italian-Japanese fascists) and make them forever accept intolerable restraints, that is not only not sacred, but evil... Only hysterical people would think that Germany, Italy, or Japan have any intention of fighting us."

　　How friendly Dulles was to the German-Italian-Japanese fascist axis shows how much he hates the Soviet Union and the world's democratic forces. Now, not to mention his various shouts, threats, and insults against China, the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving and democratic people of the world, as early as October 1943, when the United States and the Soviet Union were still allies and were fighting side by side with the German-Italian-Japanese fascist axis, which Dulles had declared not long before had no intention of fighting the United States, Dulles convened a meeting of more than 5,000 religious figures at St. John's Cathedral in New York, launching a Christian Mission of World Order. He told the more than 5,000 people attending the meeting: "If the United States cannot restore its creative spirit, then the rebuilt countries will fall to the Soviet Union. The influence of the Soviet Union will expand, because these countries will be encouraged and inspired by its actions." Therefore, he called on the religious circles in the United States to make the United States "a country with a creative faith" and "everyone must have a creative faith." Obviously, the "creative faith" that Dulles was talking about was to establish the idea of ​​US imperialism dominating the world, to make the American people oppose the Soviet Union, oppose the oppressed nations, and establish an "American century."

　　However, the "faith" of dominating the world is by no means "creative," and although Dulles and all the Wall Street war-mongers have made painstaking efforts to promote it for five or six years, it is still hopeless, so that he had to lament sadly in his book "War or Peace?" last year:

　　"Our country is always unsuccessful, there is something wrong, otherwise we would not be in the present predicament and mood. What we lack is a just and powerful faith. Without it, everything is in vain for us... At home, our cultural system cannot attract people to the spiritual loyalty necessary to defend it... Abroad, the promotion of our foreign policy can only rely on money and goods. These are limited, and because they are limited, our policies are also limited, and limited policies are inevitably defensive policies, and defensive policies are inevitably failed policies."

　　He also said: "People's (referring to Americans) thoughts are confused, their souls are corroded, and no matter how efficient the work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is, it is impossible to protect us under such circumstances."

　　As for the growth of the Soviet Union and the progressive forces in the world after the war, Dulles had to admit: "The balance of world power has undergone a decisive change, which is beneficial to communism... When our influence and security decline, the influence and security of the Soviet Union rise... The consistent policy of the Soviet Union seems to be advocating peace in general, and even in the United States, this view is accepted by many important people."

　　This is such a sad confession of the American imperialists! But will Dulles's imperialist gang retreat because of this, abandon their aggression, and solve the problem along the road of peace? That will never happen. On the contrary, their answer is to strengthen the clamor for war and create an atmosphere of tension. Dulles said very frankly: "If the crisis of war seems to have passed in the near future, that is the time of the greatest crisis. In that way, we will be tempted to relax, be negligent, and disarm." This policy was precisely the policy of "artificial manufacturing to keep the American people in a state of panic" that he advocated after attending the foreign ministers' meeting in Paris in the spring of 1949. American imperialism is tearing its face and going its own way to do this, even if it causes opposition and hatred from the people of the world, it will not hesitate. Dulles said: "Our efforts in the West after the war are not participating in a popularity contest. Even if we can buy popularity with money, it is not worth 20 billion US dollars, not to mention that we do not have any popularity now."

　　Dulles is indeed quite self-aware. Sometimes his self-awareness even makes him a little "cute." For example, in his speech on December 29 last year when he participated in the debate on the foreign policy after the US imperialist's disastrous defeat in Korea, he said: "The biggest problem of our time is whether our Western civilization (i.e., the capitalist system) has reached such an old and decadent stage that it has to die,..." He admitted that the United States could not be contained in "a series of Korean incidents," because he said that would make the United States "have no power anywhere and go bankrupt everywhere." But he also disagreed with Hoover's partial "shortening of the defense line" proposal, because he believed that "a defense that is ready to be surrounded must quickly disintegrate." Under this tragic situation of being unable to advance or retreat, Dulles had to comfort himself: "We have not reached the end of the road to the point where we can do nothing."

　　Dulles has recently repeatedly declared with tears in his eyes that he will never be willing to "die in bed," he will "struggle to the death" and "find a way out from counterattack." This is the reason why he went to Japan this time. Obviously, his visit to Japan this time is to conspire to make a separate peace with Japan, arm Japan, and drive the Japanese people to take chestnuts from the fire for the US imperialists who are running into walls and panicking everywhere. In a word, his so-called "finding a way out from counterattack" is to make the Japanese people cannon fodder for the US imperialists. However, arming Japan will inevitably endanger China's security, and the Chinese people will swear to oppose it; arming Japan will inevitably threaten the peace of the Far East and the world, and the people of the Far East and the world will swear to oppose it; arming Japan will inevitably deepen the suffering of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people will swear to oppose it; arming Japan will even make the American people feel uneasy and arouse opposition. In this way, the US imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan will not only fail to strengthen the "counterattack" power of US imperialism, but on the contrary, the Chinese people, the Asian people, the Japanese people, the American people, and all peace-loving people in the world will unite more closely, act more actively, and give the US imperialists an even more painful blow, making them more isolated. This is the inescapable fate of Dulles, a member of the suicide club, and the Wall Street bosses.

　　战争贩子杜勒斯（下）
    闻生
    杜勒斯在国际上的反动活动，的确也是自小即有教养的。他的外祖父富士特曾在他的《外交回忆录》里大吹特吹过他如何在一八九五年以满清政府顾问的身份，协助日本帝国主义夺取台湾的“勋绩”。据他自己说，李鸿章曾为出卖台湾的问题感到极端的苦恼，因为李鸿章告诉他，依照中国的惯例，凡割让土地，负责者必须亲到该地去办理移交，惟鉴于台湾人民的强烈反对，他不敢到台湾去。这位帝国主义顾问于是为李鸿章想出一个“妙计”，叫他采用“西方国家的普通办法”，把台湾的地契交给日本便是，不必自己到台湾去办理移交。“这样”，富氏很得意地说：“李鸿章及其儿子就在淡水港的日本旗舰上将台湾交与日本。”富士特的《外交回忆录》，据美国一九四四年出版的《现代名人录》说，是杜勒斯一生最喜欢读的书。同时，他的外祖父的生平事迹，又是他的“思想上的教师”。
    因为富士特协助出卖台湾“有功”，一九○七年海牙会议时，腐败的满清政府又聘他为中国代表团的顾问，那时杜勒斯年仅十九岁，大学还未毕业，竟借其外祖父的提携，做了满清政府代表团的秘书。自此以后，他便成为美国反动派的在国际上的风云人物。一九一七年，他奉美总统威尔逊之命，以国务院特派代表的资格，到中美洲一带去活动，阴谋破坏各国的独立运动和加紧对它们的经济剥削。第一次世界大战时，他被任命为陆军上尉，不久即擢升为少校。一九一八年，他做了美国战时通商局局长的助理。第一次世界大战结束后，他被任命为巴黎和会美国代表团的顾问，以后又到德国去，充当赔款委员会的美国委员。二次世界大战以还，所有重要的国际会议，他更是没有一次不参加。
    可是他出任的职务，都是由美国政府任命的，从来不是由人民选举的。他生平只有一次让美国人民决定他的政治职务，那是一九四九年十一月他竞选为纽约州的国会参议员，但是这一次他却遭到纽约州选民决定性的惨痛打击而失败了。不过，这个战争贩子虽然为美国的选民所坚决拒绝，没有被选为参议员，杜鲁门却于他刚刚竞选失败之后就委任他为美国出席联合国的代表，不久，又委任他为国务院的高等顾问，继续主持美国的反动外交政策。
    在美国国内，这个被美国进步人士称为“怀抱着强盗哲学的托拉斯主义者”的杜勒斯，又是以“宗教领袖”的面目出现的。他所有的侵略的阴谋毒计都披上“为维持基督教文化”的外衣。他是美国基督教联合会的要人，他通过该会的正义与永久和平委员会，动员美国的宗教势力，利用教堂及反动牧师，来宣传他的侵略主义，以欺骗和麻醉美国的人民。同时，他又与鲁斯之流的法西斯分子互相勾结，由鲁斯动员其出版物把杜勒斯宣传成为一个“世界最伟大的宗教领袖”，“慈悲为怀的心肠”，“为患着灾难的上帝儿女保卫他们的文明”。
    不错的，杜勒斯对于法西斯强盗们是怀着“慈悲为怀的心肠”的。一九三九年他写了一本书《战争、和平、与改变》，反对制裁德意日法西斯轴心。他说：“即使有实际的需要，但是如果我们以镣铐加诸充满生命力的人民（即德意日法西斯分子）之上，使其永远接受不可容忍的束缚，那不独绝非神圣，而且是罪恶……只有患着歇斯底里病的人，才会想到德国、意大利或日本有对我们作战的意图。”
    杜勒斯对德意日法西斯轴心多么亲善，就是他对于苏联和世界民主力量多么仇视。现在他对于中国、苏联和世界上爱好和平民主的人民种种的叫嚣、恐吓、侮辱，自不必说了，远在一九四三年十月，那时美国和苏联还是同盟国，并且正在并肩与杜勒斯在不久之前尚宣布为对美国没有作战意图的德意日法西斯轴心进行着生死的战斗，杜勒斯即在纽约的圣约翰大教堂召开了有五千多名宗教人物参加的会议，发动了一个号称世界规模的基督教福音运动（Christian Misisor of World Order）。他对那五千多名参加该会的人演讲说：“假如美国不能恢复其创造的精神，那么，重建起来的国家即将倒向苏联方面了。苏联的影响是会扩大的，因为这些国家都会从它的行动上获得鼓舞与激励。”因此，他号召美国的宗教界，为着使美国成为“一个有创造信仰的国家”而“每个人都必须有创造的信仰”。很显然的，杜勒斯所说的“创造信仰”，就是确立美帝国主义独霸世界的思想，要美国的人民反对苏联，反对被压迫民族，建立一个“美国的世纪”。
    可是独霸世界的“信仰”是丝毫没有什么“创造性”的，虽然经过杜勒斯和所有华尔街的战争贩子们五六年来绞尽心血的努力推行，依然一筹莫展，以至他去年在《战争乎？和平乎？》一书中不能不伤心叹息说：
    “我们这个国家总是事不顺遂，有毛病，否则我们就不会陷入现时的苦境与心情。我们所缺乏的是一种正义的和有力的信仰。没有它，对我们一切都是徒然……在国内，我们的文物制度并不能吸引人们为着保卫它所必需的精神上的忠贞……在国外，我们外交政策的推行仅能依靠金钱和货物。这些都是有限的，正因为它们是有限的，所以我们的政策也有限，有限的政策，不可避免的是防守的政策，而防守的政策，则不可避免的是失败的政策。”
    他又说：“人们（指美国人）的思想是混乱了，他们的灵魂是腐蚀了，不管联邦调查局的工作多么有效率，在这种情形下也是无法保护我们的。”
    至于战后苏联和全世界进步力量的壮大，更使得杜勒斯不得不承认：“世界力量的对比已起了决定性的变化，这种变化是有利于共产主义的………当我们的影响和安全向下降落的时候，苏联的影响和安全是上升了………苏联一贯的政策，在一般的人看来，好像是主张和平的，就是在美国，这种观点也为许多重要的人们所接纳。”
    这是美帝国主义者多么悲哀的自白啊！但是，杜勒斯的帝国主义者流会不会因此便知难而退，放弃他们的侵略，而沿着和平的道路解决问题呢？那是决不会的。相反，他们的答案是加强战争的叫嚣，制造紧张的空气。杜勒斯很坦白地说过：“假如在最近的将来，战争的危机好像是过去了，那便是最大危机的时候。那样，我们便会被引诱而松懈起来，疏忽起来，解除了我们的武装。”这一政策，正是他在一九四九年春天参加巴黎的外长会议后所提倡的“必须用人工制造的方法使美国人民继续恐慌”的政策。美帝国主义是撕破脸皮一意孤行地要这样做的，纵使因此而引起世界人民的反对与痛恨，亦在所不惜。杜勒斯说过的：“我们战后在西方的努力并不是参加人望的竞赛。即使我们能用钱买到人望，它也不值二百亿美元，何况我们现在并没有什么人望。”
    杜勒斯的确是颇有自知之明的。有时候他那颇有自知之明的本领还使他几乎有点“可爱”。例如他在去年十二月二十九日参加美帝国主义在朝鲜惨败后的外交政策争论时所发表的演讲，即说：“我们这个时代最大的问题，就是我们西方的文明（即资本主义制度）是否已经达到这么衰老和腐朽的阶段，而不得不死亡，……”他承认美帝不能被牵制在“一连串的朝鲜事件中”，因为他说那样便会使得美帝“在任何地方都没有力量以及在任何地方都要破产。”但是他也不赞成胡佛的部分“缩短防线”的主张，因为他认为“一个准备被包围的防御一定要迅速瓦解。”在这种进不得退不能的悲惨局势之下，杜勒斯只好自己安慰自己了：“我们还没有穷途末路到一筹莫展的地步。”
    杜勒斯近来痛哭流涕地一再声明，他决不肯“死在床上”，必然“拚死的挣扎”，要从“反击中找寻出路”。这便是他这次到日本去的原因了。很显然的，他这次到日本，是要阴谋对日单独媾和把日本武装起来，驱使日本人民去为到处碰壁焦头烂额的美帝国主义者火中取栗。一句话，他的所谓要从“反击中找寻出路”，就是要日本人民去为美帝作炮灰。可是武装日本势必危害中国的安全，中国人民必誓死反对；武装日本势必威胁远东及世界的和平，远东及世界的人民必誓死反对；武装日本势必加深日本人民的灾难，日本人民必誓死反对；武装日本甚至使美国的人民也感到不安，而引起反对的情绪。这样，美帝武装日本的阴谋不独不能增强美帝国主义的“反击”力量，相反，中国人民、亚洲人民、日本人民、美国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，会更加团结起来，行动起来，给美帝国主义者以更惨痛的打击，使之更陷于孤立。这便是自杀俱乐部会员杜勒斯和华尔街老板们不可脱逃的命运。
