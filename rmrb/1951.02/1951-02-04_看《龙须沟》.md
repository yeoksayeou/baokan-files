　　Watching "Dragon Beard Ditch"
　　Li Bozhao
　　I remember that during the discussion of the 1950 Beijing urban construction plan, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, instructed: Urban construction in the capital should have a mass perspective and follow the mass line. The areas of the East and West City have always been the focus of urban construction, and many people live and frequently visit there, but the past reactionary governments never paid attention to them. Therefore, our people's urban construction plan must first consider the needs of production and the laboring people, clearly distinguishing it from the urban construction policies of the reactionary regime. Let us first eliminate the dirty and smelly ditch that the ruling class in Beijing has never visited and never cared about – Dragon Beard Ditch. This suggestion marked the starting point and basic content of the People's Government's capital urban construction.

　　Writer Lao She grasped this theme, profoundly portraying a group of poor and hardworking people in Dragon Beard Ditch, depicting how they gradually recognized their People's Government from unconsciousness to consciousness. This work is a high combination of human sentiment and reason, so it is deeply moving. Beijing has been liberated for two years. For those who have few opportunities to understand and become familiar with the poorest group of working people in Beijing, Mr. Lao She's play is a good textbook.

　　When watching the rehearsal, I felt like I was not watching a play or a performance, but was in the play, sharing the joys and sorrows with the characters. In addition to the success of the script, this is also the success of Mr. Jiao Juyin's realistic directing method.

　　Comrades Han Bing, Ye Zi, Yu Shizhi, and other actors spent a lot of time living in Dragon Beard Ditch. Their performance, the achievement in the art of spoken drama, and the creative completion of the performance of "Dragon Beard Ditch" by all the staff engaged in stage art work are also worth learning for drama workers.

　　The small defects of the whole play are minor compared to the successful aspects, but we should strive for perfection. On the existing basis, eliminating the small flaws in the play and the performance, especially making greater efforts in reciting lines, then greater achievements can be expected. The Beijing People's Art Theater is willing to use "Dragon Beard Ditch," which reflects the construction of the capital, as a well-made gift to comfort the cadres who have worked hard and diligently and are responsible for the Party and government leadership in the capital, and all the staff engaged in municipal construction, and to help the people of the capital understand how the people's capital is being built.

### 看《龙须沟》

　　看《龙须沟》
    李伯钊
    我记得在讨论一九五○年北京都市建设计划时，中共市委书记彭真同志曾这样指示：首都市政建设，应该有群众观点，群众路线。东西城一带，历来为市政建设注意中心，而群众居住甚多，常来常往的地方，过去反动政府倒是从来不放在眼里。因而我们人民的市政建设计划，首先要替生产替劳动人民着想，明显地区别于反动政权的都市建设方针。让我们首先消灭掉北京历来统治阶级从来不去，从来不管的肮脏臭沟——龙须沟。这个提示，标志了人民政府首都都市建设的出发点和基本内容。
    作家老舍先生抓住了这个主题，深刻地刻画了龙须沟的一群穷苦勤劳的老百姓，描写他们怎么从不自觉到自觉地认识自己人民政府的过程。这个作品是人情和理智的高度结合，所以感动人也深。北京已经解放了两周年，对于少有机会去了解和熟悉北京顶穷苦的一群劳动人民的人，老舍先生的戏是一本好课本。
    看彩排的时候，我仿佛不是在看戏、看表演，而是置身剧中，与剧中人同患难共欢乐。除了剧本的成功以外，这也是焦菊隐先生现实主义导演方法的成功。
    韩冰、叶子、于是之及其他演员同志，花了不少时间生活在龙须沟。他们的表演，在话剧演剧艺术上的成就，和全部从事舞台艺术部门工作的人员有创造性地完成了《龙须沟》的演出工作。这也是值得戏剧工作者学习的。
    全剧小的缺陷比起成功方面来是小事，但我们应该精益求精。在现有基础上，把剧作中，表演中的小疵去掉，特别是对读词的功夫下更大的苦心，那么可以料定得到更大的成就。北京人民艺术剧院愿意拿反映首都建设的《龙须沟》——精制的礼物，慰劳一年来辛苦勤劳，负责首都党政领导工作的干部和从事市政建设的全体工作人员，并且帮助首都人民，认识人民的首都是如何建设的。
