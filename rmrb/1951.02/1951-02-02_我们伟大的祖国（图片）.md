    Our Great Motherland
    From 2500 to 250 BC, the ancestors of our various ethnic groups successively created the 彩陶 (Caitao) culture, which was incomparably brilliant in world history. These four complete colored pottery jars were unearthed in Banshan, Ningding County, Gansu Province in 1923, and are artifacts dating from approximately 2200 to 1700 BC.
