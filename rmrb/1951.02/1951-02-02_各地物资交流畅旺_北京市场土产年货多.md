    Thriving Material Exchange Across Regions
    Abundant Native New Year Goods in Beijing Markets

    [This newspaper report] The Beijing market for vegetables, meat, dried and fresh fruits, and other goods in preparation for the Spring Festival is becoming increasingly lively. In addition to the usual New Year goods, this year the market offers many native and specialty products from various regions. The meat and vegetable markets feature pork transported from Baotou, winter bamboo shoots from Zhejiang, Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, northeast wild mushrooms, daylily from Datong, Sichuan peppercorns from Shexian, Guangdong star anise, Yutian cabbage, and fresh fish from Zhouhe and other areas of Ji County. The dried and fresh fruit market includes oranges from Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hangzhou, pomelos from Liuzhou, apples, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds from the Northeast, persimmon cakes from Handan, and recently, raisins transported from Xinjiang.

    These native and specialty products are transported by state-owned native product companies, trust companies, cooperatives, private merchants, and even farmers and peddlers. After the start of the twelfth lunar month, native product companies dispatched business personnel to Shanghai, Hankou, the Northeast, and other places to purchase New Year goods. Goods already transported back include kelp, cauliflower, sea cucumber, wood ear fungus, wild mushrooms, oranges, persimmon cakes, dried apricots, chestnuts, honey, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, etc. Apples purchased in the Northeast and dried fruits and fennel transferred from Shanxi are being loaded and prepared for transport. The Municipal Cooperative Headquarters purchased Changsha rice and Rehe pork for its members. The cooperative warehouse also transported oranges from Mount Tiantai and Jinzhou vermicelli. Private merchants have transported an even greater variety of New Year goods. Just the organized native product food and tobacco industries, comprising eleven sectors, have purchased nearly 10 billion yuan worth of meat, fresh fish, mountain goods, fruits, etc., from various regions. The native products transported by farmers and peddlers also occupy a considerable position in the market. For example, Yutian cabbage, which sells well in Tianjin and Tanggu, has a daily market supply of 10,000 catties in the Xianongtan market. In addition, every morning, dozens of peddlers from Ji County and Pinggu transport fresh fish, persimmons, etc., on wheelbarrows to the Chaoyangmen Avenue market.

    The exchange of native products has enriched the Beijing market's New Year goods. These native products are welcomed by the vast consumer base. The New Year goods transported by the native product companies are consistently in short supply. Some goods, such as thirty tons of pickled mustard tuber, sea cucumber, and wild mushrooms, sold out as early as mid-January. A second purchase of fifteen tons of pickled mustard tuber has already been shipped from Hankou. Most of the vermicelli purchased by the company from Tangshan has been ordered by cooperatives. The daily sales of native product foods such as kelp, wood ear fungus, and dried bamboo shoots in the food department of the Municipal Department Store are increasing. The daily sales revenue of the food department has increased from 400,000 to 500,000 yuan to around 3 million yuan. The business of shops and stalls in various markets is also booming on the premise of "complete goods." The Guozishi market outside Qianmen is crowded with wholesale peddlers in the morning and congested with unloading trucks in the afternoon. The sales revenue of some merchants engaged in native products has increased. For example, the sales revenue of southern fresh fruits (oranges, bananas, pomelos, etc.) in the dried and fresh fruit industry in December last year was more than twice the total sales revenue of the entire year of 1949. The daily transaction volume of Yutian cabbage in the Xianongtan market alone is 3,000 to 5,000 catties. Last year, Beijing's suburban cabbage harvest was poor, and with the increased demand during the Spring Festival, prices were rising daily. The large-scale transportation of Yutian cabbage to Beijing has stabilized the price of in-ground cabbage between 350 yuan and 400 yuan.

    The exchange of native products has met the needs of Beijing's workers, citizens, and suburban farmers for celebrating the New Year. The variety of New Year goods purchased by consumer cooperatives for their members has increased. Some items, such as oranges from Mount Tiantai, Tianjin dried fish, and five-spice fish slices, are things that most members are eating for the first time. Native products from afar are not only welcomed by the people of Beijing but are also familiar and dear to people from all over the country residing in the capital. Rarer items in the market are even more popular. Xinjiang raisins have appeared on the market. Before liberation, a small amount of these raisins was imported, and they were generally regarded as treasures.

    As farmers' native products have found sales channels, the purchasing power of farmers has increased. This is evident in the fact that farmers from Yutian County who transport cabbage to Beijing for sale often bring back grain and daily necessities. Peddlers from Ji County also exchange grain and some New Year goods after selling fresh fish in Beijing. Due to the farmers and peddlers bringing back New Year goods or daily necessities after selling goods in the city, and the increase in purchases by other places in Beijing, the sales revenue of department stores and New Year goods industries has increased. For example, the Dongxiaoshi branch of the Municipal Department Store is constantly visited by customers from outside the district. The sales revenue in mid-January increased threefold compared to the first ten days of the month. The department store sells sugar, socks, towels, sneakers, paints, etc. The sales of Kun socks in the knitwear market have also increased due to purchases by merchants from Shenyang, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang. Tianzhu chopsticks transported from Hangzhou are a high-quality and inexpensive daily necessity with a wide sales market. Buying a bundle (eight or ten pairs) for 1,000 yuan is enough for the whole family. Many farmers who come to the city to purchase goods buy them to replace their years-old bamboo chopsticks during the Spring Festival.

### 各地物资交流畅旺  北京市场土产年货多

　　各地物资交流畅旺
    北京市场土产年货多
    【本报讯】春节前的北京蔬菜、肉类、干鲜果等市场，日渐热闹起来。在市场上所有的货物，除普通的年货外，今年增添了许多各地的土产和特产，在肉类、蔬菜市场上有远自包头运来的猪肉，有浙江冬笋、四川榨菜、东北元蘑、大同黄花菜、涉县花椒、广东大料、玉田白菜，以及蓟县周河等地所产的鲜鱼。在干鲜果市场上有由江西、四川、杭州等地来的橘子、柳州柚子和东北的苹果、榛子、葵花子、邯郸来的柿饼，近来还出现有新疆运来的葡萄干。
    这些土产和特产，是通过国营土产、信托等公司、合作社、私商以至农民、乡贩运来的。土产公司在进入腊月后，为采购年货派出业务人员分赴上海、汉口、东北等地。已经运回的货物有海带、花菜、海参、木耳、元蘑、橘子、柿饼、杏干、栗子、蜂蜜、花椒、大料等，在东北采购的苹果、和由山西调来的果干、茴香等，正装车待运。市合作总社为社员采购了长沙大米、热河猪肉等；通过合作货栈还运来了天台山产的橘子、锦州粉条等。经私商运来的年货更是种类繁多。只组织起来的土产食品、烟叶等十一个行业，就由各地采购到总值近百亿元的肉类、鲜鱼、山货、水果等。农民和乡贩运来的土产在市场上也占相当的地位，如畅销津沽的玉田白菜，近来在先农坛市场的每日上市量就有万斤。此外在朝阳门大街市场每日清晨都有几十个蓟县、平谷的乡贩，分别用独轮车推来鲜鱼、柿子等。
    通过土产交流，丰富了北京市场的年货。这些土产得到了广大消费者的欢迎。土产公司运来的年货，始终是供不应求，部分的货物如三十吨榨菜和海参、元蘑等远在一月中旬就卖完了，二次采购的榨菜十五吨已由汉口启运。该公司由唐山采购的粉条，多数为合作社所订购。市百货公司食品部的海带、木耳、秀笋等土产食品，每日出售量日渐增加，平时食品部每日售货额四、五十万元，现增到三百万元上下。各市场的商号、摊商的生意也在“货全”的前提下兴隆起来，前门外果子市，上午挤满了趸购的小贩；下午被卸货的大车所拥塞，若干经营土产的商号售货额增加了。如干鲜果业去年十二月份南鲜部分（橘子、香蕉、柚子等）的售货额，较一九四九年全年销售额多二倍。玉田白菜只先农坛市场每天的成交量就有三千至五千斤。北京近郊去年白菜歉收，在春节需要增多下，价格日见上升，由于玉田白菜大量运京，使伏地白菜价格平稳在三百五十元至四百元之间。
    通过土产交流，满足了京市职工、市民以及郊区的农民过年的需要。全市各职工消费合作社为社员筹购年货的种类增多了，其中有一些物品如天台山的橘子、天津的风鱼、五香鱼片等都是多数社员第一次吃到的东西。远地而来的土产，不仅受到北京市人民的欢迎，对居住首都的各地人民也是亲切而熟悉的。市场上一些罕见的东西，更是大家所喜欢的。新疆葡萄干已在市上出现，这种葡萄干，在解放以前，曾有小量的输入，一般人视为珍品。
    由于农民的土产找到销路，提高了农民的购买力，能明显看出的，如玉田县运白菜到京销售的农民，在回去时多捎回粮食和日用百货；蓟县乡贩在京出卖完了鲜鱼也要换回粮食和部分年货。由于农民、乡贩进城卖货后带回年货或日用品，和外地在京市采购量的增加，百货、年货等行业的售货额增多了。如市百货公司的东晓市门市部，每日外区顾客络绎不绝，一月中旬的售货额比上旬增加了三倍。售出的百货有食糖、袜子、毛巾、球鞋、颜料等。针织品市场上的坤袜，在沈阳、保定、石家庄等地客商采购下，销路也见增加。由杭州运来的天竹筷子更是一种物美价廉、有广大销路的日用品，用一千元买一把（八双或十双不等），就够全家使用了。进城购货的农民买的很多，用以在春节时替换使用经年的毛竹筷子。
