　　Commemorating the "February 7th" Strike by Launching a Patriotic Production Campaign
　　Liu Rong
　　The 28th anniversary of the "February 7th" Strike is here again. This is the day our working class waged a heroic struggle against imperialism and reactionary warlords. Today, our entire nation is engaged in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting against the American imperialist aggressors in Korea and achieving great victories. Commemorating this great day is of significant importance. As an old worker from the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway and a participant in the "February 7th" Strike, I am very happy. I would like to take this opportunity to share the events of the "February 7th" Strike and my thoughts with everyone.
　　In 1922, the railway workers of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway began to fight against the bureaucrats and warlords. The situation of the workers at that time was completely different from today. Bureaucrats, warlords, and imperialists colluded to oppress and exploit us, treating workers like beasts of burden. Generally, workers earned only seven or eight yuan per month, at most around ten yuan. Wives and children were underfed and poorly clothed, yet the work was very arduous. Now, the People's Government and the trade union care for us, fearing we will be overworked, and forbid overtime at will. But at that time, those working day shifts worked ten to twelve hours a day. Small stations had only one shift, and even large stations had only two. If someone fell ill, not only was there no one to care for them, but their wages would be deducted, unlike now when we have labor insurance regulations and mutual aid societies to care for us. And that's not all. At that time, we also had to endure the temper of those in charge, who would beat or scold us. The troops of the warlords Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin were especially violent in beating and scolding people. The workers had no choice but to unite and launch a strike movement to fight against the bureaucrats and warlords. I remember that at that time we demanded a uniform wage increase, no wage deductions for sick leave, and a total of seven demands were made to those reactionary bureaucrats and warlords, forcing them to agree to five. The result of this strike dealt a great blow to the Northern Warlord Wu Peifu, and the workers were very happy. Through this movement, everyone understood that to deal with bureaucrats and warlords, we must unite and resolutely fight against the enemy in order to achieve victory. This was the only way out for everyone. For example, if we workers were hungry and said, "Please, Bureau Chief, show great kindness and have pity on the suffering people, give us some wages!" they would not agree, because they were lackeys of the bureaucrats and warlords, not treating workers as human beings. If you said they were unfair, then you were breaking the "law," saying you were disobeying orders, and at best you would be fired, at worst a note would be written and you would be sent to jail, suppressing the workers to the point where they dared not speak out. The Beijing-Suiyuan Railway strike was forced in this way. This first victory caused a sensation on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. In 1922, the Zhili-Fengtian War opened its front lines in Liulihe and Changxindian on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Bandit armies fought bandit armies, and the people suffered. These beasts raped the families of workers and robbed their possessions. The disaster suffered by the workers was severe. After the new year, the workers of the Changxindian factory united to fight and launched a general strike, achieving victory. This was the "February 7th" Strike of 1923. That strike was led by the entire Beijing-Hankou line and the Changxindian factory. To unite the working class, expand its strength, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, it was decided to convene the second meeting of representatives from across the railway in Zhengzhou on August 14th to establish the preparatory committee of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union, to study how to unite workers across the country and fight the warlords to the end. Therefore, we decided to convene the founding meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union in Zhengzhou on February 1, 1923. Who knew that on January 28th, unexpected news arrived: the Northern Warlord Wu Peifu telegraphed his lackey, Zhao Jixian, the director of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau, telling him not to allow us to hold the meeting, and said some threatening words to the workers. When the worker representatives heard this, they were so angry that they rose up and cursed him, "You lackey of the warlord, dare to disrupt this meeting!"
　　At that time, the reactionary scoundrels began to attack, and the barbaric army used guns to disperse our meeting! We were empty-handed, some went up to snatch their guns. At this time, Wu Peifu telegraphed, telling our worker representatives to go to Luoyang to discuss. At this time, the workers' heroic spirit was truly admirable, saying, "Go! Wu Peifu is just a man, we are not afraid, go, we must go! Better to die than not strike, better to die than not revolt!" After the representatives arrived in Luoyang, Wu Peifu did not allow the representatives to hold the founding meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union, and threatened, "I have already issued an order to stop the meeting." Therefore, the railway workers of Changxindian went on strike on February 4th, and the railway workers of Zhengzhou and Hankou followed suit. On February 7th, the lackey Xiao Yaonan, under the direction of the warlord Wu Peifu, began to massacre workers. At that time, four or five people were killed in Changxindian, and in the Jiang'an area of Hankou, under the direction of the warlord's lackey Zhang Housheng, workers were also brutally massacred. Most unforgettable was Comrade Lin Xiangqian and a dozen others, who died under the knife of the warlord Zhang Housheng. The bandit Zhang tied Lin Xiangqian to a utility pole at the station and asked, "Why are you striking?" Our representatives said in unison, "You bureaucratic lackeys, barbaric army, don't treat us like human beings, treat us like beasts of burden, so we must strike." Bandit Zhang asked, "Will you resume work or not?" Comrade Lao Lin took the lead and said, "No, we have not received the resumption of work order from the General Trade Union, we cannot resume work until death!" The lackeys carried out their massacre by slashing and questioning. Comrade Lin Xiangqian firmly said, "Our heads can be cut off, but work cannot be resumed." In this way, Comrade Lao Lin heroically sacrificed himself. He is a glorious warrior of our working class and a good example of fighting against the ruling class, worthy of our permanent commemoration.
　　Twenty-eight years have passed since the "February 7th" Strike. Although our working class and the people of the whole country have been liberated under the leadership of Chairman Mao and have become the masters of the country, our greatest enemy, American imperialism, is not reconciled. It does not want our workers to be liberated and wants to push us back into the depths of hell, so it invades Korea and our Taiwan, bombing our territory. We can never tolerate such madness. The working class and people across the country have stood up and enthusiastically launched the movement to resist America and aid Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are heroically fighting American imperialism and have achieved great victories. Our working class, especially the railway workers, should maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" Strike, closely follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao, launch a patriotic production competition, fight American imperialism on the production front, unite the people of the whole country, defend the motherland and world peace, and use practical actions to commemorate the "February 7th" Strike and mourn the heroic martyrs who died in the "February 7th" Strike!

　　纪念“二七”开展爱国主义生产竞赛
    柳荣
    “二七”二十八周年纪念日又来到了，这是我们工人阶级向帝国主义、反动军阀作英勇斗争的日子。今天我们全国各地又正在展开抗美援朝运动，中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜和美帝国主义侵略者斗争，并取得了伟大的胜利，我们来纪念这个伟大的日子，是有很重要的意义的。我是京绥线的老工人，也参加过“二七”斗争，我心里感到非常高兴，我想趁这个机会把“二七”的经过和我的感想和大家谈谈。
    民国十一年京绥路铁路工人，就开始向官僚、军阀作斗争。那时工人的情况完全和现在不同，官僚军阀和帝国主义勾结压迫和剥削我们工人，把工人当作牛马看待。一般工人的工钱每人每月只七、八元，最多的是十元上下，老婆孩子吃不饱、穿不暖，但是工作却是很劳累。现在人民政府和工会怕我们劳累，照顾我们，不许随便加班加点；但那时打日勤的每天工作十小时到十二小时，小站上只有一班人，大站也只二班倒。如果病了，不但没有人照顾，反而要扣薪金，不像现在有劳保条例和互助会来照顾我们。这还不算，当时在班上还要受当头的人的气，不是打就是骂，军阀吴佩孚和张作霖的军队，打人骂人也非常厉害。工人们万般无法，只好联合起来举行罢工运动，向官僚军阀作斗争。我记得那时候我们提出一律加薪，病假期不许扣薪，向那些反动的官僚军阀一共提出七个条件，逼得他们答应了五条。这次罢工的结果，给了北洋军阀吴佩孚一个很大的打击，工人们很高兴。在这个运动中，大家懂得了要对付官僚军阀，只有大家团结一致，坚决的和敌人斗争，才能得到胜利，这就是大家的出路。比如我们工人吃不饱，要是说：“请局长施大恩，体恤受苦人，给点工钱吧！”那他是不肯的，因为他们是官僚军阀的走狗，拿工人不当人看，你要是说他不公平，那就犯了“法”，说你不服从命令，轻则开除，重则写一个纸条，送你进牢狱，压迫得工人敢怒不敢言。京绥路的罢工，就是这样逼起来的。这头一次的胜利，哄动了京汉铁路。民国十一年的直奉战争，又正是在京汉线的琉璃河、长辛店拉开了战线。匪军打贼军，遭殃的还是人民。这些野兽强奸工人的家属，抢劫工人的东西，工人遭到了的灾难是严重的。过了年，长辛店大厂的工人就团结起来进行斗争，举行了全体工人的大罢工，得到了胜利。这就是民国十二年“二七”的斗争。那一次的罢工，是以京汉全线和长辛店大厂带头的。为了团结工人阶级，扩大力量，在共产党的领导下，决定八月十四日在郑州召集全路代表开第二次会议，成立京汉路总工会筹备委员会，研究怎么样使全国工人团结一致，与军阀斗争到底。因此，我们就决定一九二三年二月一日在郑州召开京汉路总工会成立大会，谁知道在一月二十八日意外的消息传来了，北洋军阀吴佩孚给他的走狗京汉铁路局长赵继贤打电报说，不让我们开会，还说了些威吓工人的话，工人代表一听，气得大家起来对着他骂：“你这军阀的走狗，敢来捣乱这个大会！”
    当时，反动家伙们开始下毒手了，野蛮的军队动了枪，将我们的大会给冲散！我们赤手空拳，的有上去夺他们的枪。这时吴佩孚来电报，叫我们工人代表去洛阳商量。这时工人那种英勇劲真使人佩服，说：“去！吴佩孚他也是一个人，我们不怕，去，一定要去！怕死不罢工，怕死不革命！”当代表到洛阳以后，吴佩孚不允许代表开京汉路总工会成立大会，并且威胁说：“我已经下了命令要制止开会。”于是长辛店的铁路工人就在二月四日罢工了，郑州、汉口的铁路工人也接着罢工了，到二月七日狗腿子萧耀南在军阀吴佩孚的指使下，便开始屠杀工人了。当时长辛店被杀者有四、五人，汉口江岸方面，在军阀狗腿子张厚生指使下，也残暴地屠杀工人。最使人难忘的是林祥谦同志他们十几个人，死在军阀张厚生的屠刀下。张贼把林祥谦绑在车站电杆上问：“你们为什么闹罢工？”我们的代表异口同声说：“你们这些官僚走狗，野蛮军队，拿我们不当人，拿我们当牛马，就要罢工。”张贼问：“你们复工不复？”老林同志领头说：“不行，我们没有接到总工会的复工命令，至死不能复工！”走狗们就连砍带问地肆行他们的屠杀手段。林祥谦同志坚决地说：“头可断，工不可复。”就这样，老林同志英勇地牺牲了。他是我们工人阶级的光荣战士和向统治阶级进行斗争的好榜样，值得我们永久纪念的。
    “二七”至今二十八年了，虽然我们工人阶级和全国人民在毛主席的领导下翻了身，做了国家的主人，但是我们最大的敌人——美帝国主义，却是不甘心的，它是不愿意咱们工人翻身，想把我们再压到地狱底下去，所以它侵略朝鲜和我国台湾，轰炸我们的领土，我们是决不能容忍这种疯狂的暴行的。全国工人阶级和人民都站起来了，热烈地展开了抗美援朝运动，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇地打击美帝国主义，取得了伟大的胜利。我们工人阶级特别是铁路工人应该保持和发扬“二七”的光荣传统，紧紧地跟着共产党，跟着毛主席走，展开爱国主义生产竞赛，在生产战线上打击美帝国主义，并团结全国人民，保卫祖国和世界和平，用实际行动来纪念“二七”，悼念在“二七”英勇死难的战友！
