The Collapse of the U.S. Military's "38th Parallel" Defense Line
    Zhu Liu Zhao Xu
    The "38th Parallel"—U.S. imperialism once used it as a dividing line to split Korea and as the starting point for launching a war of aggression. In the eyes of the American bandits, what a wonderfully advantageous position it was!
    After the winter "general offensive" launched by the bandit MacArthur on November 24th, which was severely hit by the Chinese People's Volunteers along the Cheongcheon River on the western front and turned into a "general collapse," the bandits suffered a crushing defeat and fled south. In their disorganized and desperate retreat, in addition to inhumanely massacring Korean civilians and carrying out desperate acts of destruction, creating a scorched-earth no-man's-land to prevent the pursuing Chinese and Korean People's forces, the bandits nervously recalled their old position, the "38th Parallel," fantasizing that it was a panacea to save them from their disastrous fate. Thus, calming their panicked minds, under the guise of shouting "ceasefire and peace talks," they greatly strengthened their defenses.
    According to the inevitable division of labor between masters and cannon fodder, the bandit MacArthur used eight tattered and unreorganized puppet army divisions as a vanguard, with four or five U.S. Army divisions as a rearguard, forming a defensive position with a wide front of over 400 li and a depth of over 100 li. They probably had no illusions for the time being, placing all their hopes on holding the "38th Parallel." Just as the commander of the puppet 6th Division, Zhang Daoying, said in his order to his subordinates to hold the "38th Parallel": "This is a vital defense line related to our lives," "Absolutely do not retreat a single step..." Therefore, they utilized all possible terrain, obstacles, fortifications, and weapons that could prevent our advance as much as possible: the steep cliffs and mountains along the Imjin River; old and newly built layers of bunkers and communication trenches; countless indistinguishable hidden bunkers on cliffs and at the foot of mountains; horizontally placed house-ridge-shaped barbed wire in front of the defensive positions; densely laid elastic mines along the river and at intersections; high-hanging tripwires on tree branches; countless planes patrolling day and night, swooping down and strafing the mountain tops and villages north of the river; long-range artillery blindly bombarding main roads and the river surface, dreaming of melting the frozen Imjin River into flowing water to block the advancing spearhead of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The volunteer soldiers saw very clearly that the fleeing bandits had done two things to the Korean people: one was to force the kind residents of Anju, Nyongbyon, and Kasan to flee south with them, forcibly dragging young girls of seventeen or eighteen onto trucks, and collectively shooting the remaining men, old people, and children. The other was to burn all the residential houses and wealth on both sides of the road, and even the forests, in a fire during the retreat. This inhuman atrocity and destructive devastation ignited an uncontrollable fire of hatred in the hearts of every volunteer soldier who loved their motherland and loved peace, wishing they could devour this group of man-eating beasts in one gulp. At the same time, they deeply realized that if the enemy was not eliminated, the people of their motherland would also suffer the same harm as the Korean people. This made them forget the fatigue of prolonged fighting, forget the cold and hunger. Fifteen lightly wounded comrades from a certain unit refused to go to the rear for recuperation, resolutely requesting to follow the team and avenge the Korean people. "Keep fighting, don't let the enemy breathe!" This was the urgent feeling of every soldier. This feeling converged into a force of thousands of troops advancing, turning into a slogan for the entire army's actions. They raced towards the "38th Parallel" at a speed of nearly a hundred li per night.
    In the snowy and cold nights of minus twenty or thirty degrees, on the vast white earth, through the undulating mountains, along the roads and rugged mountain paths, a steel-like advancing column threaded its way. The biting cold wind penetrated the soldiers' sweat-soaked cotton uniforms. Fatigue after sweating lowered the soldiers' body temperature, and the cold caused their limbs to lose sensation. The shoes, frozen hard, walked on the icy and snowy roads, with the possibility of falling with every step. Such hardships continued day and night. What supported the soldiers was not their physical bodies, but their determination and will. Soldier Wang Liqian fell more than forty times one night. When he fell the hardest, his comrades lovingly helped him up. He said, "Even if I break my bones, I can't break my determination!"
    They quickly approached the enemy. The infantry dug fortifications and shelters, and the artillerymen concealed themselves in their positions. The attack mission was passed down, and the positions showed a tense and excited atmosphere: the commanders were observing the terrain; the troops were actively preparing for the breakthrough; each squad and platoon expressed their determination to their superiors, requesting the first assault mission. Everyone unanimously proposed: Victoriously break through the 38th Parallel, fight a beautiful battle, and wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year!
    At 5:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve, 1950, the signal flare for the general offensive flashed over the Imjin River. The group's artillery fire and countless heavy machine guns suddenly roared. The mountains and villages on the north bank of the river all roared. This roar represented the endless hatred of the North Korean people towards the enemy; it represented the cheers for the imminent liberation of the South Korean people. The whistling sound and explosions of the giant bombs passing through the night sky echoed violently in the dark valleys of South Korea. The shells exploded in clusters on the enemy's positions, emitting sparks that mocked the enemy, destroying the enemy's fortifications, and suppressing the enemy's firepower. The south bank of the river trembled, the land trembled, and the enemy trembled. Ten minutes, twenty minutes... The "rumbling" sound of the artillery fire suppressed the sound of the enemy planes' engines. The sparks of the advancing signal flares shot through the light of the flares dropped by the enemy planes. Countless heroes of the sharp knife troops surged towards the opposite bank of the Imjin River. The soldiers' hearts were beating faster, their blood was circulating faster, and everyone wanted to seize this good opportunity to perform meritorious service and avenge themselves, and realize their determination. Comrades Bian Xijun and others ran at the forefront, swiftly clearing the layers of obstacles such as mines and barbed wire on the assault route. The hand grenades of Comrade Chen Mengqi's assault platoon repelled the chaotic enemy. They quickly occupied the beachhead. The warriors of the Sixth Company, who broke through from Daetianli, charged forward despite the tight firepower. Platoon Deputy Xie Jingui led five comrades to insert themselves into the enemy's bunker group. Young soldier Wang Shirong held a demolition tube and sent it into the enemy's bunker. The stubborn enemy was suddenly destroyed with the sound of the explosion. At this moment, amazing deeds appeared in every corner of the battlefield. The Second Platoon of the Second Company cut off the retreating enemy on the highway. The fierce firepower shattered the bandits. Squad Leader Zhou Zhiguo snatched weapons from the enemy and fiercely shot and killed the chaotic bandits. The "38th Parallel" defense line, which was vital to the enemy's life, was torn into countless gaps. The sharp knife troops of our volunteer army deeply and rapidly penetrated the enemy's layers of defense. The "38th Parallel" defense line was shattered, and the enemy's courage was shattered. The victorious spearhead of the Volunteer Army continued to point towards the south bank of the Han River.

　　美军“三八”防线的破灭
    朱流　赵徐
    “三八线”——美帝国主义曾把它作为分裂朝鲜的鸿沟，作为发动侵略战争的起点。在美国匪徒们看来，它是多么奇妙的有利阵地呵！
    麦贼十一月二十四日所发动的冬季“总攻”，在西线清川江沿岸，遭到志愿军严重打击变为“总崩”以后，匪徒们惨败南逃了。他们在溃不成军、疲于奔命的逃窜中，除惨无人道的集体杀害朝鲜和平居民和进行绝望的毁灭手段，造成焦土无人区，以阻止衔尾追击的中朝人民部队外，匪徒们神经质地回想起了老阵地“三八线”，幻想以它作为挽救其惨败命运的万灵丹似的新防线。于是，定了定惊慌失措的心神，在高喊“停火和谈”的伪装下，大肆布防了。
    按照主子和炮灰的必然分工，麦贼以破烂不堪未得整理的八个伪军师团作前导，四、五个美军师为后卫，组成了宽正面四百余里、纵深一百余里的防御阵地。他们暂时可能没任何的幻想了，一切都寄托在“三八线”的固守。正如伪六师团长张道英给他的部下下的固守“三八线”的命令中所说：“这是条关系我们生命的重要防线”，“决不后退一步……”。因此，他们将所能利用的一切可能阻止我们前进的地形、障碍、工事、火器等都尽量地应用起来：临津江沿岸陡壁绝崖的山峦；旧有和新筑的层层地堡、交通沟；悬崖上，山脚下，无数难以分辨的暗堡；阵地前沿，横置屋脊形铁丝网；江边，道口，密布弹性地雷；树枝上，高挂拉雷；无数架飞机昼夜巡逻和俯冲扫射江北岸的山头和村庄；长射程炮火，盲目地排击着要道和江面，梦想把冰冻的临津江，热化成水流，以阻挡志愿军的前进矛头。
    志愿军战士们看得很清楚，南逃的匪徒，给朝鲜人民作了两件事情：一件是强迫安州、宁边、价川一带善良居民随他们南逃，把十七、八岁的年青姑娘硬拉到卡车上载走，剩余的男人、老人和儿童集体枪杀。另一件是在溃逃途中，把公路两侧的居民房屋和财富，甚至于山林，一火焚尽。这种惨绝人寰的暴行和毁灭性的破坏，使每个热爱祖国、热爱和平的志愿军战士，内心里炽烈的燃烧着不能遏止的杀敌怒火，恨不得把这群吃人野兽一口吞嚼下去。同时，也深深体会到：不消灭敌人，祖国人民同样也会要遭到像朝鲜人民一样的残害。这使他们忘记了久战的疲劳，忘记了寒冷和饥饿。某部十五个轻伤同志，拒绝去后方休养，坚毅地要求随队行动，为朝鲜人民复仇。“打下去，不让敌人喘息！”这是每个战士的急迫心情。这种心情汇成一股千军万马前进的力量，化成全军行动的口号。他们以每晚近百里的速度，追向“三八线”。
    零下二、三十度的风雪寒夜，白茫茫的大地，在起伏山峦的公路和崎岖的山道中，穿插着钢铁般的前进行列。凛冽的寒风，吹透战士们汗湿的棉衣。汗后的疲劳，降低了战士们的体温，冷气使四肢失去了知觉。冻得硬蹦蹦的鞋子，走在冰雪的道路上，每一步都有跌倒的可能。像这样的艰苦，是日以继夜的。支持战士们的不是肉体，而是决心和意志。战士王立前一夜跌四十多跤。当跌得最重时，同志们友爱地搀扶他。他说：“跌断了我的骨头，跌不碎我的决心！”
    很迅速地逼近了敌人。步兵们挖好工事和掩体，炮兵们隐蔽地进入阵地。攻击任务传下来了，阵地上呈现出一种紧张而兴奋的气象：指挥员们在观察着地形；部队在积极地作突破准备；各个班排，都向上级表达决心，要求首次突击任务。大家一致提出：胜利突破三八线，打漂亮仗，给毛主席拜年！
    一九五○年除夕五点半钟，总攻开始的信号弹闪耀在临津江上空。集团的炮火，无数的重机枪，突然地发出怒吼。江北岸的山岳、乡村，全怒吼了。这种怒吼，代表着北朝鲜人民对敌人无尽的愤恨；代表着为南朝鲜人民即将解放而欢呼。巨弹穿过夜空的嘶叫声、爆炸声，在南朝鲜阴暗的山谷，震起了剧烈的回响。炮弹在敌人阵地上一丛丛地爆炸，发出了嘲笑敌人的火花，摧毁着敌人的工事，制压了敌人的火力。江南岸在颤抖，土地在颤抖，敌人在颤抖。十分钟，二十分钟……炮火的“轰隆”声，压住了敌机的马达声。前进信号弹的火花，射过敌机投下的照明弹的光。无数尖刀部队的英雄，汹涌地扑向临津江对岸。战士们的心房在加速跳动，战士们的血液在加速循环，大家都想抓住这个立功报仇的好机会，实现自己的决心。边喜君等同志跑在最前面，敏捷地扫除冲锋道路上的地雷、铁丝网等层层障碍。陈孟齐同志突击排的手榴弹，排击着混乱的敌群。他们迅速地占领了滩头阵地。从大田里突破的六连勇士们，冒着严密火力冲锋。排副谢金贵率领五个同志，插向敌人地堡群。青年战士王世荣手持爆破管，送进敌人地堡里。顽抗的敌人，随着爆炸的声响，遽然毁灭了。就在这个时候，惊人的事迹，出现在战场的各个角落。二连二排在公路上拦腰断住溃逃的敌人。激烈的火力，打得匪徒们七零八落。六班长周治国从敌人手里夺过武器，猛烈地射杀着溃乱的匪徒。关系敌人生命的“三八”防线，被撕破成无数缺口。我志愿军锋利的尖刀部队，向敌人的层层防御，纵深地，急遽地穿插着。“三八”防线破裂了，敌人的胆破裂了。志愿军的胜利矛头，继续指向汉江南岸。
