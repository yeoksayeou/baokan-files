　　Statement by Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union:
    Supporting the General Strike of Japanese Coal Miners
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, issued a statement in support of the general strike of more than 200,000 Japanese coal miners, stating:
    The conspiracy of American imperialism and the Japanese Yoshida puppet government to revive Japanese militarism and prepare for an expanded war of aggression is bound to increase the plunder and exploitation of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, which will inevitably lead to the deterioration of the working conditions and the continuous decline in the living standards of the Japanese working class. This is the fundamental reason for the outbreak of the general strike of more than 200,000 Japanese coal miners.
    This large-scale strike struggle shows that the awareness of Japanese coal miners has been greatly improved, their strength has been growing, and they are taking practical actions to oppose their exploiters and rulers.
    We believe that the struggle of Japanese coal miners to ensure their minimum living standards and strive for reasonable improvement of living conditions is completely justified. Their strike struggle initiated due to the failure of negotiations with the company authorities is completely just. Therefore, their struggle will surely win the widespread sympathy and support of the Japanese people and the people of the world and achieve victory.
    The broad masses of Chinese coal miners express deep concern for the lives of Japanese miners, pay tribute to their heroic struggle, and are willing to give them fraternal support.

　　我煤矿工会全国委会主席谈话
    声援日煤矿工人大罢工
    【新华社十八日讯】中国煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫为声援日本二十余万煤矿工人大罢工发表谈话称：
    美国帝国主义与日本吉田傀儡政府复活日本军国主义准备扩大侵略战争的阴谋，势必加重对日本工人阶级及日本人民的劫掠和榨取，因而也就必然造成日本工人阶级劳动条件的日趋恶劣和生活水平的不断下降。这是日本二十余万煤矿工人爆发总罢工的基本原因。
    这一大规模的罢工斗争说明，日本煤矿工人的觉悟程度已经大为提高，力量已经日渐强大，并以实际行动来反对他们的剥削者和统治者了。
    我们认为：日本煤矿工人为了保障本身最低的生活水平、争取生活条件的合理改善而进行的斗争是完全应该的。他们因与公司当局谈判失败而发起的罢工斗争是完全正义的。因此，他们的斗争必能取得日本人民及全世界人民广泛的同情和支持而获得胜利。
    广大的中国煤矿职工对日本矿工的生活表示深切的关怀，对他们正在展开的英勇斗争表示敬意，并愿意给予他们兄弟的支援。
