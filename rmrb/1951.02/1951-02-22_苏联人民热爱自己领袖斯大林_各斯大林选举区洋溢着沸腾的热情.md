　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th (TASS dispatch): Reports are pouring in from various republics holding Supreme Soviet elections about voters' enthusiastic participation in the elections and a great patriotic upsurge. The election districts that nominated Stalin as a candidate are filled with boiling enthusiasm. The elections everywhere have become a true festival of the people. The Tbilisi Lenin electoral district is the center of the political life of the Georgian Republic during the entire election campaign. Patriotic letters from every corner of Georgia are sent here, expressing their joy and pride that the great Stalin is a candidate for the district. In the early days of the revolutionary movement, Stalin laid the foundation of the Bolshevik Party organization in Tbilisi, calling on workers to join the great struggle. Today, the first people to receive ballots with Stalin's name on them are the old workers of Tbilisi, participants in underground revolutionary organizations and the first strikes and demonstrations organized by Stalin.
　　By ten o'clock in the morning, the vast majority of voters had already voted in the Tbilisi electoral district.
　　Almost all voters participated in the voting in the Baku Ilyich district, where Stalin, the great leader of the working people, served as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Republic.
　　Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, is filled with joy. The streets were crowded with people in the early morning. All voters in the Stalin electoral district finished voting by eleven o'clock in the morning. The working people declared: Our vote for Stalin is a vote for peace, a vote for communism. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan also reported the grand occasion of the election. All voters in these two republics and other republics are united by a common feeling—love and loyalty to their leader and teacher Stalin. Many voters did not go home after voting. They stayed there to exchange opinions, discuss many issues that excited them, and talk about Stalin's reply to the Pravda reporter. Tajik old worker Yudaliev, who lost four sons in the war, said to his friends: "Our merciful father, teacher, and leader, the wise Stalin, exposed the bloody plans of the new war instigators—the US and British imperialists. He pointed out the path to peace for the people of the world. We will forever consolidate the great Soviet Union's national power and steadfastly uphold the policy of peace."
　　The election of the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian Republic has become a true national holiday. The streets are filled with tens of thousands of people in festive attire. Singing and music are everywhere. In the Stalin electoral district, more than 50% of the voters cast their ballots within one hour.
　　Today, the working people of Latvia and Lithuania are electing representatives to the Supreme Soviet. In Riga, the capital of Latvia, tens of thousands of citizens came to the polling stations. Chakst, a famous lathe worker at the Riga Electrical Machinery Factory, said after voting: I voted for Stalin because Stalin gives us the happiness of peace and creative labor, and he opened up the path to science for our children.
　　In the Vilnius Stalin electoral district, the capital of Lithuania, the vast majority of voters cast their ballots in the first two hours. In the Karelia-Finland capital, Petrozavodsk, the electoral district where Stalin was nominated as a candidate, more than five hundred people had gathered before the voting began.

　　苏联人民热爱自己领袖斯大林
    各斯大林选举区洋溢着沸腾的热情
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：现正举行最高苏维埃选举的各加盟共和国纷纷传来关于选民们热烈参加选举和伟大爱国高潮的报道。提名斯大林为候选人的各选举区充满着沸腾的热情。各地的选举变成了人民真正的节日。第比利斯列宁选区在全部竞选运动中是乔治亚共和国政治生活的中心。劳动人民的爱国信件从乔治亚各个角落寄到这里，因为伟大的斯大林担任该区的候选人而表示他们的快乐和骄傲。在革命运动的初期，斯大林在第比利斯奠立了布尔什维克党组织的基础，号召工人们参加伟大的斗争。在今天，最初接到有斯大林名字的选举票的人们，都是第比利斯的年老的工人们，地下革命组织和由斯大林组织的最初的罢工及示威的参加者们。
    上午十点钟，绝大多数选民都已在第比利斯选区投了票。
    差不多所有的选民都参加了巴库伊里奇区的投票，劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林在该区担任了阿塞拜疆共和国最高苏维埃代表的候选人。
    哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图喜气洋洋。在清晨市街上便挤满了人群。斯大林选举区的所有选民们在上午十一点钟便投完了票。劳动人民宣称：我们投斯大林的票就是投和平的票，投共产主义的票。吉尔吉斯和塔吉克也报道了选举的盛况。这两个共和国和其它共和国的一切选民们，都被一种共同的感情——对他们的领袖和导师斯大林的热爱和忠诚而团结在一起。许多选民们在投票以后都不回家。他们留在那里交换意见，讨论许多鼓动他们的问题，并谈论斯大林答复真理报记者的谈话。在战争中丧失了四个儿子的塔吉克老工人俞达留夫向朋友们说：“我们的慈父、导师和领袖，英明的斯大林揭穿了新战争煽动者——美英帝国主义者的血腥计划。他向全世界人民指出走向和平的道路。我们将要永远巩固伟大的苏联的国力，确切不移地拥护和平政策。”
    摩尔达维亚共和国最高苏维埃的选举已经变成了真正的国庆日。街道上充满了成千成万的盛装的人民。处处唱歌奏乐。在斯大林选举区，一小时内有百分之五十以上的选民投了票。
    今天拉脱维亚和立陶宛的劳动人民正在选举最高苏维埃的代表。在拉脱维亚的首都里加，成千成万的市民来到了投票站。里加电力机器制造厂著名车床工人查克斯提在投票后说：我投票选举斯大林，因为斯大林给我们以和平与创造劳动的幸福，他为我们的孩子们开辟了到达科学的道路。
    在立陶宛首都维尔那斯大林选举区，绝大多数选民在最初两小时内投了票。在卡累利阿——芬兰的首都彼得罗萨佛德斯克斯大林被提名为候选人的选举区，投票开始以前就已聚集了五百多人。
