　　Biological Science and Patriotism
　　Deputy Director of the Publishing Administration　Zhou Jianren

　　I remember a Soviet author once said: telling the story of the return of birds, fish, etc., can arouse the reader's patriotic thought (something to that effect). This is indeed a "golden saying." I think that in the future, whether we are compiling books on biology or teaching biology classes, we need to pay attention to this point, that is, to permeate natural science with patriotism so that young people can increase their patriotic thinking by reading these books.

　　People generally love their hometowns and their motherland. Even if they have not consciously received patriotic education, they unconsciously cultivate this kind of thinking in their daily lives. What reason is there not to love the food, clothing, etc., that are products of one's own country's land, produced by one's own labor? Therefore, it can be said that people are born loving their motherland (developed in the process of growing up). (Except for a very small number of people who do not love their motherland, or even betray it, such as the American imperialist lackeys Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee and their ilk. However, such "people" are an extremely small minority.) But intentionally giving young people patriotic education is better than not giving it. It is more profound and firmer than unconsciously developed patriotic thinking. Therefore, this education is important and necessary.

　　Patriotism can be explained in a theoretical form, or it can be permeated in natural science (or literature and art) for young people to absorb, digest, and assimilate into a part of their own thinking. A writer once said: literature and art are different from science (referring to natural science). For example, regarding the pain caused by fire burning flesh, the scientific explanation is: when fire burns flesh, how will it feel painful? The artistic description is not like this, it is like burning you with fire so that you feel the pain yourself. I think that explaining patriotism in a theoretical form is like explaining the ability of fire to cause pain in the form of natural science; permeating it in natural science is like artistic description, making people feel the burning pain themselves. Artistic description is very useful for people who are not accustomed to reading scientific explanations, and works that permeate patriotism in natural science are also very useful for young people who are not good at reading theoretical explanations.

　　Speaking of biological science, China has a vast territory, and many migratory birds return to China to lay eggs and raise their young. The most familiar example is the swallow. It has shiny black feathers on its back, a deeply forked tail, and a chestnut-colored throat, making it easy to recognize at a glance. It comes to China in the spring (although it also goes to other countries), repairs old nests or takes mud to make new nests, lays eggs, and raises its young. In the autumn, after the young birds have grown up, they go to India, Malaysia, and other places to spend the winter.

　　The cuckoo is a bird with a great reputation, but people rarely see it. The feathers on its back are dark gray-blue. The large feathers on the wings are gray-brown, with white transverse bands on the inner webs. The tail feathers are black, with white tips and sparse white transverse bands. It breeds in China and other places. It winters in India and other places (and may also winter in the southern part of the country, such as Taiwan).

　　The crane is a famous bird both ancient and modern. There are several kinds, and a particularly famous one is often called the white crane (red on top, also called the red-crowned crane, but sometimes another kind without a red top is called the white crane) or fairy crane. As the name implies, its feathers are mostly white. The tail feathers are white and very short. When resting, the black flight feathers of the wings cover the tail, making it look like it has black tail feathers. Its legs are very long and stretch straight back when flying. It lays eggs and raises its young in the Northeast (and Korea).

　　Rare or unique creatures can also be used as material for cultivating patriotic thoughts. The golden pheasant is also a famous animal among birds. The crest feathers on the male bird's head and the "hackles" on its back and waist are shiny golden yellow. The head has feathers arranged in a cape shape, which is orange-yellow with dark green edges and transverse stripes, making it look very beautiful. It is produced in western and central China. The white pheasant is a lesser-known type of chicken. The back and tail feathers are white, with V-shaped black markings on the back. The crest and abdomen are black with a bluish sheen. The mandarin duck is produced in China, Siberia, Korea, and other places, and is also very famous. There are also rare animals such as pandas. The giant panda (usually simply called the panda) is a vegetarian carnivore that lives in western China and survives by eating bamboo shoots, bamboo leaves, etc. (although captive cubs also eat eggs and other things). Its structure has not departed from that of a carnivore, so it is classified in the Carnivora (it was formerly placed in the bear family, but recently it is often placed in the lesser panda family). Knowing that the Carnivora also contains vegetarian species makes one realize the truth and preciousness of the saying that one has no right to speak without a clear investigation.

　　It is well known that China has a rich variety of plants. Among the common flowers and trees, there are many species that are unique to China, such as plum blossoms, chrysanthemums, Luoyang flowers (pinks), primroses, Tibetan primroses, peonies, hollyhocks, etc. There are several kinds of magnolias. The daffodil is probably also one. Among the fruits, there are longans, lychees, etc. Perhaps persimmons are also. The production of agricultural crops is abundant. In addition, there are many unique species that are generally not well known, which need not be described in detail here.

　　Everyone loves the landscape, the land, the products, the people, and the achievements of human labor. In other words, everyone loves the country. In the past, China suffered from severe oppression and exploitation by feudal forces, and later from severe oppression and exploitation by imperialism, making it impossible for production to progress and limiting the development of science. I think there is another reason: the underdevelopment of science is probably also closely related to the Confucian ideology that has ruled for a long time. This idealist philosophy uses the human relations under the feudal system of seniority, hierarchy, and status to maintain social order. The ultimate nature of objective things is rarely discussed. It does not talk about ghosts and gods, nor does it explore their existence or non-existence. Therefore, the Han people, who are ruled by Confucianism, only have fragmented superstitions and have not formed a systematic religion (just as fragmented empirical knowledge does not constitute a systematic natural science). Therefore, it can be said that the Han people have no religious problems, which can also be said to be a good thing (individual people in religious circles are also progressive and patriotic. This is because religion cannot stop their progress and patriotism, not because religion makes them do so). However, the idea of not investigating the truth is also detrimental to the development of natural science. However, even so, there was still some progress and achievement in natural science in the past. Taking biological science as an example, for example, Hao Yixing was not a natural scientist. In the atmosphere where everyone believed that fireflies were transformed from rotten grass and that the wasp carried the larvae of the moth to be its own children, he observed in person and discovered that fireflies were oviparous and went through a larval stage before transforming into adults. He also saw that the wasp could lay its own eggs, and the small green worms it carried back were sealed in the nest to feed its larvae. These discoveries were quite difficult at the time and can be considered achievements. In botany, Wu Qijun's "Illustrated Examination of Plant Names and Realities" also took a lot of effort. Of course, there are others.

　　When we talk about patriotism in biological science, it is not enough to only talk about the achievements of individual authors. At the same time, do not forget the achievements of famous or unnamed labor heroes. For example, Zhang Fugui, a labor hero in Shandong, is an expert in agricultural production. He takes the lead in agricultural work and believes in science, using new methods in everything. His name is known to many people. In addition, there must be many unnamed heroes. The large amount of agricultural production is the achievement of countless agricultural laborers. It is clear that young people will undoubtedly increase their patriotic feelings when they know that there are so many hard-working people in China who are working happily.

　　The idea of loving the motherland is a scientific idea. It is an idea that is as practical and necessary in life as the idea of eating, drinking, living, and clothing, not a fabricated fantasy. Although writing in novels or poems can also increase the depth and strength of this idea, its essence is scientific, so it also needs scientific ideas to support it. Some novels or stories are about "fantasy," and some are about "reality." Realistic novels or stories, even if they are not real, must be written as if they were real. However, some small books or comic strips that write such stories cannot or do not do this. For example, there is a comic strip about a communication soldier, saying that a certain battalion of the Eighth Route Army fought against the Chiang bandit army and recruited a young soldier who had been liberated to be the battalion commander's communication soldier; one morning, he (the communication soldier) was awakened by the bugle call and rushed to beat the bugler. Another time, he went to buy badges without informing the battalion commander, and he was gone for several days. He could fight whenever he wanted, and come and go freely. There was no writing about education and discipline in the army, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Another one is about the common people in the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War. The general idea is: after the Eighth Route Army left, the Japanese army entered the village and severely beat a little girl in the village, asking her to reveal the whereabouts of the Eighth Route Army. The little girl firmly refused to say, and the Japanese soldiers told her grandfather to hit her. The grandfather was afraid that she would say it, so he beat her to death with a stick. I think: a little girl in the village would definitely not know the actions of the Eighth Route Army, this is the first point. She firmly refused to speak after being severely beaten by the Japanese soldiers, proving that she was very strong. Why did her grandfather beat her to death with a stick? What is written here does not conform to the facts and does not conform to reason, especially without considering the education and discipline of the people's army, the secrecy in the army, and the love of the working people for their children (it seems that a little girl in the village knew the actions of the Eighth Route Army, and the kind-hearted working people casually beat such a strong granddaughter to death).

　　Patriotism can be cultivated very well in natural science teaching. People cannot help but love the mountains, rivers, land, and products of their motherland; (here, I am not talking about people's mutual love and emphasis on labor and achievements) then how can learning natural sciences such as mountains, rivers, and creatures not increase love for the motherland? It will definitely increase it. Unless what is taught and learned is too far from actual life and is not connected with reality, it will naturally reduce this effect. If this is the case, there are naturally defects. Although the harm of this defect is not as great or as bad as a realistic story that violates reality, it is still defective. This defect should be remedied. That is to permeate biological science teaching with patriotic thought, so that the patriotic consciousness unconsciously developed from daily life can be raised to become intentional and conscious patriotism.

　　Since patriotism can be permeated in biological science to teach, of course, it can also be permeated in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences to teach. This is without a doubt. I also think this way, and combined with this kind of teaching, it is easy to put the bright and happy future of the new China and the infinitely beautiful prospects before young learners.

　　生物科学与爱国主义
    出版总署副署长　周建人
    记得有一位苏联的作者曾说过：讲述鸟类、鱼类等归来的情况，能引起读者爱国的思想的（大意如此）。的确是“至理名言”。我想：我们以后无论编生物学方面的书，或教生物学方面的功课，都需要注意这一点，即把爱国主义渗透在自然科学里，使青年读了这些书，能够增加爱国的思想。
    人民一般都爱自己的家乡，爱自己的祖国，即使不曾有意识地受过爱国主义的教育，在日常生活当中也不自觉地培养着这一种思想。吃的穿的等等是自己的国家的土地的产物，用自己的劳力生产出来的，为什么会不爱呢？所以一般人民可以说生来就爱自己的祖国的（在长大中养成）。（除却绝少数的人不爱祖国，或甚至叛国，卖国，如美帝走狗蒋介石及李承晚之流。不过这样的“人”是绝端少数。）但有意地给青年受爱国主义的教育，比不给更好。比无意地养成的爱国思想更深刻与更坚定。所以这教育是重要的，必需的。
    爱国主义可以用理论的形式来讲，也可以把它渗透在自然科学里（或文艺里）让青年吸收、消化、同化为自己思想的一部分。过去有一位文学家曾经讲过：文艺与科学（指自然科学）不同：比方火灼着皮肉会有痛觉一事，科学的说明是：火烧着皮肉，会如何感觉到疼痛；文艺的描写却不是这样，好像拿火烧你一下，使你自己感觉到痛。我想：用理论的形式来讲明爱国主义，很像用自然科学的形式说明火能灼痛；渗透在自然科学中来讲，很像文艺的描写，叫人自己感觉到灼痛。文艺的描写对于不习惯于读科学说明的人是很有用处的，把爱国主义渗透在自然科学里的作品，对于还不善于读理论说明的青年也很有用。
    讲到生物科学，中国地大，回到中国产卵育雏的候鸟是很多的。最熟知的例子可推燕子。背上长着带光亮的黑色羽毛，尾毛分为很深的叉，喉部栗色，叫人一见便认识。它春天来中国（虽然也到别国），修理旧窠或取泥土做新窠，产卵养小鸟。秋季，小鸟长大后，往印度，马来等处过冬去了。
    杜鹃是名声很大，但人们较少看到的鸟。它的背上羽毛呈暗灰青色。翅膀上灰棕色的大羽毛，内瓣有白色横斑。尾羽黑色，尖端白色，也有疏朗的白色横斑。它在中国等处蕃殖。冬天往印度等处过冬的（也会在本国南部如台湾等处过冬）。
    鹤是古今著名的鸟，有数种，特别有名的一种常叫白鹤（顶上红色，也叫丹顶鹤，但有时叫头顶不红的另一种为白鹤）或仙鹤。它的羽毛如白鹤这名称所指，大部分呈白色的。尾羽白色，很短，休息时，翅膀的黑色大羽毛覆在尾部上面，看去像有黑色的尾羽。脚很长，飞翔时，笔直的伸在后面的。它在东北（及朝鲜）等处生卵育雏。
    少见或特产的生物也可作培养爱国思想的材料。鸟类里的金鸡也是有名的动物，雄鸟头上冠毛及背腰上的“蓑羽”呈光亮的黄金色。头部有羽毛排列成披肩状，呈橙黄色，并有暗绿色的边缘及横纹，看去很美丽。它产生于中国西部及中部。白鹇是比较不大被知道的鸡类，背羽及尾羽白色，背上有Ｖ形的黑斑纹。冠毛及腹部黑色，有青色光辉。鸳鸯产于中国、西伯利亚、朝鲜等处，也是很有名的。还有稀有的动物如熊猫等。大熊猫（普通亦单称熊猫）是吃素的食肉兽，它生长在我国西部，吃竹笋，竹叶等生存（虽然饲养的幼兽也吃鸡蛋等物）。它的构造没有离开食肉兽，所以把它排列在食肉类里（往昔把它放在熊科里，近来常把它放在小熊猫科里）。知道食肉类里还会含有吃素的种，就愈知道不调查明白没有发言权的话之为真理与可宝贵了。
    中国植物种类的丰富，是大家知道的事情。常见的花木里，有不少种类是中国特产的，如梅花、菊花、洛阳花（石竹）、报春花、藏板春、牡丹、秋葵等等都是的。木兰有好几种。水仙大概也是的。果品中有桂圆，荔枝等，柿子恐怕也是。农作物的生产是丰富的。此外许多为普通不大知道的特产种类，这里可不必详说了。
    大家爱江山，爱土地，爱物产，爱人民，爱人的劳绩等等，换一句话，大家爱国家。我国过去因受封建势力严重的压迫与剥削，后来又加上帝国主义严重的压迫与剥削，生产不可能进步，科学的发达也受了限制。我想，还有一种原因：科学不发达与统治很久的儒家思想大概也很有关系的。这一唯心论哲学是拿长幼，上下，尊卑等等这么一套封建制度下面的人事关系来做维持社会秩序的工具。客观事物的究竟却不大去讨论它。不讲鬼神，也不探究它的有无。所以受儒家思想统治的汉族，只有断片的迷信而没有构成系统的宗教（好像断片的经验知识不构成一门有系统的自然科学一样），所以汉族没有宗教问题，也可以说是好处（宗教界个别的人士也有进步与爱国的。这是宗教不能阻止他的进步与爱国，不是宗教使他这样做）。但不查考究竟的想法同时也不利于自然科学的发展。可是话虽如此，过去自然科学还是有一些进步与成绩的，单就生物科学来说，例如郝懿行吧，他还不是自然科学者，在大家相信萤火虫是腐草所化，蜾蠃负螟蛉虫去当自己的儿子的氛围气中，他亲身去观察，竟看出萤火虫是卵生的，经过幼虫的时期，然后化为成虫。又看出蜾蠃自己能产卵，背去的小青虫封在窠中是给她的幼虫做粮食的。这等发现，在当时颇不容易，要算是有劳绩的。植物学方面如吴其浚的“植物名实图考”，也费了不少心力。当然还有别的。
    我们在生物科学中讲爱国主义的时候，单讲到作者个人的劳绩是不够的，同时不要忘记有名的或无名的劳动英雄的劳绩。例如山东的劳动英雄张富贵，是农业生产的能手，在农业上，做活起带头作用，而且相信科学，事事用新法子。他的名字是许多人知道的，此外必定还有许多无名英雄，大量的农业生产是无数农业劳动者的成绩。青年们知道中国有这么多的爱劳动的人民在欢欣地劳动，分明是能增加爱祖国的思想感情无疑。
    爱祖国这一思想是科学的思想。是像要吃、饮、住、衣的思想同样是实际的，生活上必需的思想，不是虚构的幻想。虽然写在小说或诗里，也可以增加这种思想的深入与浓厚；但它的本质是科学的，所以也还需要科学的思想来扶植。小说或故事，有的是写“幻想”的，有的是写“现实”的。写实的小说或故事，即使并不是实有其事，也须写的像实有其事。但有些写这类故事的小册子或连环画不能或没有这样做。例如有一本连环画内讲一个通讯员的事情，说八路军某营打蒋匪军，收了一个解放过来的青年士兵做了营长的通讯员；他（通讯员）一天早晨被号吹醒，便赶去打吹号人。又一次，不告知营长自己去买徽章，一去好几天。要打便打，来去自由，没有写出军队里的教育与纪律，分明不合事实。又一本是写抗日期间解放区的老百姓的。大意说：八路军开去后，日军便开入村子里，曾毒打一个村里的小姑娘，要她供出八路军的行踪消息。小姑娘坚决不说，日本兵叫她的祖父打。祖父怕她说出来，即把她一棒打死。我想：八路军的行动，村子里的一个小姑娘决不会知道，这是第一点，遭日本兵的毒打坚决不说，证明是很坚强的。她的祖父为何却把她一棒打死呢？这里写的没有军队的保密（八路军的行动，村中一个小姑娘知道似的，没有劳动人民的慈爱把这样坚强的孙女随便一棒打死了事）是不合事实，不合情理的。尤其是不想到人民军队的教育与纪律，及军队中保密与劳苦人民的对儿女们的慈爱。
    自然科学的教学当中很可以培养爱国主义的。人民对于祖国的山河，土地，物产，既无不爱好；（这里不说到人民的互相亲爱，与重视劳动及成绩）那么学习山川，生物等的自然科学，那里会不增加对祖国之爱呢？必然是会增加的。除非所教所学的东西太离开实际生活，没有与实际连合，自然也会减少这种作用。如果这样，当然有缺陷，这种缺陷的弊害虽不及写实的故事违背现实那么大或那么坏，但毕竟有缺陷。应当弥补这缺陷。便是把爱国主义思想渗透在生物科学的教学中，使不知不觉地从日常生活养成的爱国意识，提高成为有意即自觉的爱国。
    爱国主义既可以渗透在生物科学中来教，当然也可以渗透在物理、化学及别科自然科学中来教学。这是毫无疑问之事。我又这样想，并且结合着这种教学，很容易把新中国光明幸福的前途与无限美好的远景放在青年学习者的面前。
