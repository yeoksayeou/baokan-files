Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The 75th issue of the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

The editorial in this issue is titled "The Struggle Against the Rearmament of West Germany is a Struggle for Peace." The editorial states that as the American aggressors are massively and frantically arming West Germany, striving to implement the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and opposing the revival of German militarism is of great significance. The revival of German militarism threatens the security of all European peoples. The people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies resolutely oppose the revival of German militarism; they advocate resolving the German question in a peaceful and democratic manner. Peace fighters in all countries understand that only with a peace-loving, democratic Germany coexisting with the peace-loving Soviet Union can the possibility of a new war in Europe be eliminated, the great bloodshed in Europe be ended, and American imperialists be prevented from enslaving European countries. Therefore, the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany is one of the basic tasks of the peace struggle. The editorial points out that a powerful movement against the rearmament of West Germany is underway in various countries. French peace fighters were the first to mobilize the French working people against the policy of West German remilitarization—a policy of vital importance to France. Millions of peace fighters in Italy are determined to unite all the people to defend peace. In Britain, protests against the rearmament of West Germany have been sent to the Attlee government, demanding an end to the evil policy of restoring German aggressors. Against remilitarization and against turning German territory into a battlefield, the German people are launching an increasingly high tide of protest, and the entire German people are becoming increasingly united in the struggle for German unification. Even in the United States, peace forces are determined to fight against the Truman clique's aggressive policies and demand a peaceful solution to the German question. The editorial points out that amidst the protests of the people of all countries, American imperialism is running into obstacles everywhere. The editorial states: Eisenhower, in his journey through France, Italy, the United States, and other Marshallized countries, encountered powerful protest rallies and angry demonstrations by working people everywhere. Everywhere resonated the angry roars of "Eisenhower, get out of Europe!" "Block the path of aggression!" "Thwart the evil conspiracies of the war-mongers!" The editorial concludes by pointing out that in the current situation, people who cherish the peace and security of all countries cannot adopt a passive or compromising attitude toward the establishment of a new center of war danger in the heart of Europe. The resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress must be made known to every citizen of every country; these resolutions must become the direct action program for all progressive humanity to strive for peace. The position of every Communist is at the forefront of the fighters against German remilitarization and against the evil plans of the war-mongers. Peace must triumph over war! Peace will surely triumph over war!

This issue of the publication prominently features an article by Billoux, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, entitled "The Resurgence of German Militarism is a Threat to Peace and French Security." It also includes papers by Pollitt, "The Central Task is to Fight for Peace," and Frank, "The Achievements of the Second Year of Czechoslovakia's Five-Year Plan," among others.

　　《争取持久和平、争取人民民主！》中文版第七十五期介绍
    【新华社十五日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第七十五期已出版。
    该刊本期社论题为《为反对重新武装西德而斗争就是为和平而斗争》。社论说，在美国侵略者大规模疯狂武装西德的时候，争取实现第二届世界保卫和平大会的决议，反对复活德国军国主义，具有重大的意义。德国军国主义的复活，威胁到所有欧洲人民的安全。苏联和人民民主国家的人民，坚决反对德国军国主义的复活；他们主张用和平、民主的方式解决德国问题。所有国家的和平斗士们都了解，只有有了一个爱好和平的、民主的德国，与爱好和平的苏联的并存，才能排除欧洲发生新战争的可能性，结束欧洲的大流血，并使美帝国主义者不可能奴役欧洲的国家。所以反对重新武装西德的斗争是和平斗争的基本任务之一。社论指出，各国正在开展一个反对重新武装西德的强大运动。法国和平战士们首先发动法国劳动人民反对西德重新军事化的政策——对法国那样生死攸关的政策。意大利千百万的和平斗士，已立志要团结所有的人民来保卫和平。在英国，反对重新武装西德的抗议书纷纷送到艾德礼政府，要求结束恢复德国侵略者的罪恶政策。反对重新军事化，反对把德国领土变成战场，德国人民正掀起了日益高涨的抗议浪潮，全德国人民正在争取德国统一的斗争中日益团结。甚至在美国，和平力量决心为反对杜鲁门集团的侵略政策而奋斗，要求和平解决德国问题。社论指出，在各国人民的抗议声中，美国帝国主义到处碰壁。社论称：艾森豪威尔在他遍历法国、意大利、美国和其他马歇尔化国家的旅程中，到处碰到劳动人民的强大的抗议性集会和愤怒的示威。到处响彻了“艾森豪威尔，滚出欧洲去！”“挡住侵略的道路！”“挫败战争贩子的罪恶阴谋！”的愤怒的吼声。社论最后指出：在目前的情况下，珍贵各国人民的和平与安全的人们，是不能够对欧洲腹心建立战争危险的新中心这件事，采取消极或妥协的态度的。第二届世界保卫和平大会的决议，必须让每一个国家的每一个公民都知道；这些决议必须成为所有进步人类争取和平直接的行动纲领。每一个共产党人的位置，就在反对德国重新军事化，反对战争贩子罪恶计划的战士们的前列。和平必须战胜战争！和平一定战胜战争！
    该刊本期以重要地位登载了法国共产党政治局委员比卢所作题为《德国军国主义的死灰复燃是和平与法国安全的威胁》。另外还登载了波立特的《中心任务是为争取和平而斗争》、弗兰克的《捷克斯洛伐克五年计划的第二年的成就》等论文。
