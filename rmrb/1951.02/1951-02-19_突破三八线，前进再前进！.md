　　Break Through the 38th Parallel, Advance and Advance Again!
　　Wéi Yīng, Bǐng Qián
            I. Capturing the Natural Fortress of Daochenghyun

    The eastern part of the Imjin River is a continuous mountain range. The enemy, in every strategic point on the mountain, added many new bunkers to the old reinforced concrete bunkers, surrounded by dense minefields.
    Daochenghyun on Guowang Peak is the only pass through these mountains, about 900 meters high, forming a vertical cliff with a precipitous terrain, equivalent to the Luding Bridge in the "Story of the Chinese Red Army's Long March." It is a famous natural fortress on the 38th Parallel. From the foot of the mountain to the top, there is only a rugged path. The snow on the road is frozen and slippery, and a little carelessness will cause one to fall into the dozens of feet deep ravine. The Li pseudo-army's 32nd Regiment of the 2nd Division used all its firepower to block this dangerous pass, blindly confident that this was an impregnable defense line.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, regardless of fatigue, pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy, not giving them a chance to catch their breath. On New Year's Eve of 1950, the 4th Company of a certain regiment of the 24th unit, marched at a rate of 15 li per hour, rushing from 90 li away to the foot of Guowang Peak. Without any rest, they immediately advanced from the flank to attack the summit. They were walking without a road. The engineers temporarily dug small pits on the hillside, and the soldiers used their toes to push against these small pits, climbing up with tree branches and vines, slipping one step at a time. The thorns on the trees cut their hands and tore their clothes, but everyone still climbed with all their might. Many people slipped and fell, five were injured, and one comrade unfortunately fell to the bottom of the mountain.
    The 5th Squad finally climbed to the top first, which was beyond the enemy's expectations. The enemy fired in a panic. Our two grenades bloomed inside the enemy's bunker, killing and wounding two enemies, and seven enemies raised their hands in surrender.
            II. Infantry Chasing a Jeep

    The 4th Company continued to break through into the enemy's depth. An American advisor and four puppet soldiers were driving a small jeep south in a frenzy, and a deputy platoon leader of the 4th Company led several soldiers to chase after them. The enemy drove over a small bridge and dropped a pack of explosives from the car, destroying the bridge. The soldiers ran over the river. Later, the enemy fled to a small village, stopped the car, looked at the map, and contacted the air with a white cloth. When we were about to catch up, the enemy got into the car and ran again.
    Every time the enemy crossed a bridge, they threw down a pack of explosives. Every time they passed a village, they stopped to look at the road and contacted the air. This happened a total of five times. Each time, just as we were about to catch up with the enemy, they ran away again.
    The soldiers were furious and determined to capture the cunning enemy. We bypassed the road, and the enemy stopped again at the entrance of a village, waving a white cloth in the air. Suddenly, the Volunteer Army had arrived in front of them. The enemy jumped into the car, and just as they had driven five or six steps away, our deputy platoon leader chased up and grabbed the American advisor's collar. "This time you can't run away!" The soldiers escorted the prisoners, patted their legs, and happily said, "Our No. 11 car has caught up with the enemy's jeep!"
            III. Running Forward

    On the road to Gapyeong, our entire unit was running forward, chasing the enemy non-stop.
    It was already dawn. Today is New Year's Day in 1951. "Fight the first battle of the new year well, and give it to Chairman Mao as a New Year's gift!" Every comrade was bravely advancing. Even during the day, we must pursue and annihilate the enemy. Dozens of enemy planes circled repeatedly overhead, but no one paid attention to them. The heroic spirit of the soldiers frightened the enemy planes instead. The planes suddenly swooped down and fired a burst of machine gun fire beside the road, and then dropped gasoline canisters, setting fire to the houses along the road. Not a single one of our soldiers fell. We were still running forward in several rows on the road. The enemy planes were also confused, unable to distinguish what kind of troops we were, and only flew around overhead, not daring to strafe or bomb. By the time the enemy planes realized that it was the Volunteer Army at noon, our 4th Company had arrived at Jaenyeong-ri and defeated an enemy battalion guarding it. The 4th Company, this heroic company, fought ten battles along the way from breaking through Guowang Peak to attacking Jaenyeong-ri. It annihilated two enemy companies in Gyeolincheon and captured more than 200 enemies. In eighteen hours, it advanced one hundred and fifty li. It successfully completed the breakthrough mission.
            IV. One Company Captures More Than Two Thousand Enemies in One Day and Night

    The Li pseudo-army's 31st, 32nd, and 17th Regiments were retreating across the board. One night, the 5th Company of a certain regiment of the 24th unit used hand grenades to defeat the enemy's five breakout attempts. Finally, it completely disrupted the enemy and captured more than 1,200 people, including the deputy regimental commander and chief of staff of the 32nd Regiment. On the 2nd, during the day, the unit captured more than 1,000 more enemies while searching the mountains. When a certain company was searching the mountains, it encountered more than 100 enemies who waved to us to indicate surrender. One of our soldiers ran over, shook hands with them, patted them on the shoulders, and took out a piece of biscuit for them. Although it was a small piece of biscuit, it conveyed our lenient treatment policy. More than 100 enemies swarmed up, vying to hand over their guns.
            V. Advance! Advance Again!

    Crossing the Bukhan River and the Hongcheon River, advance towards Hoengseong. Twenty-five li north of Hoengseong, we caught up with the U.S. Army's 2nd Infantry Division. The enemy was entrenched in four villages. In the northernmost village, there was a jeep on sentry duty. The 9th Squad of the 6th Company of a certain regiment of the 24th unit pounced on it, killing one enemy. The remaining enemies fired a shot, abandoned the jeep, and ran. We captured three villages in a row, defeating the enemy's two counterattacks. Finally, we compressed the enemy into a depression. Attacking from the front required passing through a stretch of open ground, so the 9th Squad went through the enemy's heavy machine gun fire from the side and circled behind the enemy. At this time, the enemy's guns were all firing north! The 9th Squad fired a burst of machine gun fire from behind. When the enemy turned their heads and saw the Volunteer Army rushing to their side, they quickly tilted their hats, some raised their hands, and some cried and shouted. Some enemies gestured by wiping their necks, meaning "Will you kill us?" We waved our hands, and the enemy gave a thumbs up.
    The 9th Squad had only six comrades, and they captured more than sixty enemies alive. They sent the prisoners to warm houses. These prisoners all cursed Truman and MacArthur. They said, "These war-mongers are not what the American people need!" When they heard about our lenient treatment policy and were told that they would be sent to a safe rear area, they happily sang songs; some even swayed their bodies, tapping their feet below.

　　突破三八线，前进再前进！
　　维英　炳前
            一、攻克天险道城岘
    临津江东部是连绵不绝的山区，敌人在山上每一个险要部分，在旧有的钢骨水泥地堡里，又增加许多新的地堡，周围埋上密密的地雷群。
    国望峰上的道城岘，是通过这里群山中唯一的隘口，高约九百米，成垂直峭壁，形势险陡，相当于“中国红军长征故事”中的腊子口，它是“三八线”上有名的天险。从山下到山顶，只有一条崎岖小道。道上的雪冻得溜滑的，稍不小心就会摔到数十丈深的山沟里。李伪军二师三十二联队以全力火力封锁住这个险恶的道口，它们盲目的自信这是攻不破的防线。
    中国人民志愿部队不顾一切疲劳追歼南逃的敌人，不让它们有喘息的机会。一九五○年除夕晚上，二四部队某团四连，以每小时十五里速度的急行军，从九十里外赶到国望峰的山脚下。他们一点也没有休息，立刻从侧翼向山顶攻击前进。他们走的没有路，工兵临时在山坡上挖出一个一个小坑，战士们就用脚尖蹬着这些小坑，攀着树枝和枯藤，一步一滑地向上爬。树上的针刺划破了手，撕碎了衣服，大家还是使劲地爬。有许多人滑跌倒，有五个人跌伤，有一个同志一失脚不幸摔到山底下去了。
    五班终于最先爬到山顶了，这是出乎敌人意料之外的。敌人慌乱地打起枪。我们的两颗手榴弹已在敌人的地堡内开了花，毙伤了两个敌人，七个敌人举起双手投降。
            二、步兵追吉普
    四连继续向敌人纵深突破。一个美国顾问和四个伪军坐着一辆小吉普车向南狂奔，四连一个副排长带着几个战士追上去。敌人跑过一道小桥，从车上放下一包炸药，炸毁了桥梁。战士们就从河上面跑过去。后来，敌人逃到一个小村子里，停下车，看看地图，用白布对空中联络一阵。等到我们快追到跟前了，敌人爬上车就又跑。
    敌人每过一道桥，就扔下一包炸药。每过一个村子，就停下来看看路，对空联络一下。这样一共有五次，每次眼看追到敌人跟前，敌人又跑掉了。
    战士们可恼火了，坚决要抓住狡猾的敌人。我们从小路上绕过去，敌人又在一个村口停下了，正在用白布向空中摇摆。突然，志愿军已赶到它们面前。敌人跳上汽车，刚开出五、六步远，我们副排长追上去一把抓住美国顾问的衣领子，“这回算你跑不了啦！”战士们押着俘虏，拍拍自己的两条腿，高兴地说：“我们的十一号汽车追上了敌人的吉普车！”
            三、跑步前进
    在通往加平的公路上，我们整个部队都在跑步前进，一刻不停地追击敌人。
    已经天亮了。今天是一九五一年的元旦。“打好新年第一仗，给毛主席作为新年献礼！”每个同志都在奋勇地前进。就是白天，也要追歼敌人。敌人几十架飞机在头顶上反复盘旋，谁也不理会它。战士们的英雄气概，反而把敌人的飞机吓住了。飞机突然俯冲下来，在公路旁边打一梭机枪，一会儿又扔下汽油筒，把路旁房子打的烧着火。我们战士没有一个人倒下，仍然在公路上排成几路跑步前进。敌人飞机也给弄得昏头昏脑，分不清是什么队伍，光在头上飞来飞去，不敢扫射轰炸。等到中午敌机发觉了是志愿军后，我们四连已赶到济宁里，击溃了守敌一个营。四连，这个英雄连队，从突破国望峰到打了济宁里，沿途作了十次战斗。在巨林川歼敌两个连，俘掳二百多敌人。在十八小时内，前进了一百五十里。胜利完成了突破的任务。
            四、一个连一昼夜俘敌两千余
    李伪军三十一、三十二和十七联队全线溃退了。一日晚上，二四部某团五连，以手榴弹打垮了敌人五次突围战。最后，将敌人全部打乱，俘敌三十二联队副联队长参谋长以下一千二百余人。二号白天，该部在搜山中又抓住一千多敌人。某连在搜山时，遇到一百多敌人，向我摆手表示投降。我们跑过去一个战士，和他们握握手，拍拍他们肩膀，并掏出一片饼干给他们。虽然是一块小小的饼干，但却传达了我们的优俘政策。一百多敌人都轰的一下围上来，争先恐后地缴枪。
            五、前进！再前进！
    跨过北汉江、洪川江，向横城前进。在横城北二十五里，我们追上了美军步兵第二师。敌人扼守在四个村子里。最北面一个村子，有一辆吉普车放哨。二四部某团六连九班猛扑上去，打死一个敌人。其余的敌人打了一枪，扔下吉普车就跑。我们一连串打下三个村子，打垮敌人两次反击。最后，把敌人压缩在一片洼地里。从正面攻击要经过一段开阔地，九班就从侧面敌人的重机枪火网中穿过去，绕到敌人背后。这时，敌人枪口都朝北打呢！九班的机枪从背后打一梭子弹，敌人一扭头，看到志愿军冲到身边了，敌人赶紧歪过帽，有的举起双手，有的哭哭啼啼地叫唤。有的敌人用手比划抹抹脖子，意思是“杀不杀？”我们摆摆手，敌人竖起大拇指。
    九班只有六个同志，活捉了敌人六十多个。他们把俘虏送到温暖的房子里。这些俘虏都大骂杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟。他们说：“这些战争贩子不是美国人民所需要的！”当他们听到我们的俘虏政策，并且告诉他们将要送到安全的后方时，他们都高兴的唱起歌；有的竟幌着身子，脚在下面打起拍子来。（附图片）
