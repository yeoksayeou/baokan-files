　　The Role of the Beijing Municipal Youth League Organization in the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement
　　Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League Zhang Dazhong
　　In November of last year, the Beijing Municipal Youth League organizations and the broad masses of young people participated in and promoted the great historical Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement. In this movement, the Beijing Municipal Youth League organizations improved their level of political work and became the core of unity and struggle for the broad masses of young people in Beijing.
　　When American imperialism ignited the flames of its war of aggression on our country's borders, the people of the whole country launched a great patriotic movement. The Beijing Municipal Youth League organizations immediately took action and joined the ranks of the struggle. However, at the beginning, some League members had a vague understanding of American imperialism; some League members lacked sufficient confidence in victory. In the movement, through meetings to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism, current affairs studies, and propaganda in factories and rural areas, League members strengthened their love for the motherland and their hatred for American imperialism, and launched a struggle in action against counter-revolutionary elements hiding in schools. The entire faculty and students of Xinsheng Middle School united to expel Chen Dequan, who spread rumors. The faculty and students of Shengxin Women's Middle School struggled against imperialist elements who tore up slogans. In the movement, they recognized their own strength, saw that American imperialism was indeed a paper tiger, greatly boosted their morale, and enhanced their national self-esteem and self-confidence.
　　In the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement, the cadres of the Youth League were tempered and cultivated. Before the movement, the performance of some League members was similar to that of the masses; in some schools and factories, only about 20% of the Youth League members were regularly active. With the development of the movement, most of the League members took action. At the Shijingshan Power Plant, 95% of the League members took the initiative to do propaganda work. According to incomplete statistics from more than 30 large and medium-sized schools such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, Boys' No. 8 Middle School, and Girls' No. 1 Middle School, League members and students together organized more than 21,000 people and 220 propaganda teams, who went out to conduct propaganda more than 910 times, reaching more than 570,000 people. In the propaganda work, the Youth League members and students showed amazing creativity and created many miracles. Some people who never liked to speak became very good propagandists: League member Luo Bopeng from Peking University gave more than 40 reports at the cinema, and was warmly welcomed by the masses every time; some people who had never been on stage were able to create a moving short play in two hours; some League members became experts in clapper talk, shadow plays, and cross-talk. Short plays and poems such as "As Long as the Mountains Are Still There," "Young Guerrillas," and "Hatred" were very touching to the audience every time they were performed. Many League cadres also learned how to study the situation and raise questions in their work with the masses.
　　In the past, some League members in some League branches had disharmony with the masses, especially some League members had a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. After this movement, many League members and students shook hands with each other and apologized excitedly: "We are all Chinese, we all love the motherland, personal matters should not cause discord; I was wrong in the past, please forgive me!" Especially when encountering difficulties in work, League members always stood in the front. In one class at the Normal University, the League members organized the students to dance the "Paper Tiger" dance. When there was no tiger head, the students were a little discouraged, so the League members made the tiger head overnight. When Boys' No. 4 Middle School went to the countryside for propaganda, the League members slept on the ground and let the students sleep on the heated brick bed, and the cadres got up at night to cover the students with quilts. The spirit of many cadres and League members, who worked tirelessly and resolutely overcame difficulties, moved the masses very much. Many schools had people asking to join the League, with more than 80 at Tsinghua University and more than 50 at Fu Jen University. Many students care about the League organization. One student from Peking University wrote a letter to an ineffective League group saying: "Precisely because the Youth League is our own organization for young people, I cannot help but offer my opinions and ask you to improve your work." As a result, the League members were educated and quickly improved their work.
　　Before the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement, the Beijing Municipal Youth League organizations played an active role in production, learning, and work, but they did not pay enough attention to the ideological and political education of League members. Some Youth League members were unwilling to do League work, did not read newspapers, and did not care about current affairs. The first Beijing Municipal Congress of the Youth League, held in mid-October of last year, clearly stated that Youth League members must first have advanced thinking and arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Every Youth League member, in addition to doing their own work such as production and learning, must also do League work; otherwise, the Youth League cannot become the Party's assistant and reserve force. Therefore, many League members in schools have re-studied the League Program and League Constitution, and examined their past mistakes of not caring about politics and work. At the beginning of the movement, the Tsinghua University League Committee printed the League oath on cards and distributed them to every League member. Many League members in schools and factories, when working, thought of themselves standing in front of Chairman Mao and taking the oath, and remembered that "Youth League members must not be afraid of all difficulties and sacrifices" and that "Youth League members have no insurmountable difficulties," and were filled with courage.
　　In the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement, the Youth League must closely rely on the leadership of the Party. Without the unified leadership of the Party, multi-headed arrangements for work can easily lead to confusion and cause losses to the work; on the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the League, give play to the organizational role of the League, and enable every League member to understand the purpose of the work and have a certain amount of work. At the beginning, all the League cadres in some schools participated in the Committee for Defending World Peace and Resisting American Aggression and assumed various specific tasks, thus relaxing the leadership of the branch over the League members. In this way, the League members were not clear about the tasks and could not be mobilized, which affected the development of the work. We paid attention to this problem and assigned three tasks to the League members: First, lead the masses with their own exemplary actions to complete the work; second, study current affairs well and organize the masses to study; third, every League member should do propaganda work anytime and anywhere. The grassroots organizations concretely grasped the situation according to different situations. Before going to the countryside for propaganda, Boys' No. 4 Middle School put forward ten points of attention to the League members. When each school went to the factory for propaganda, they established League branches or temporary groups to assign tasks to the League members in a timely manner. The Shijingshan Power Plant proposed: "Propaganda work can be done by everyone," and "Every propaganda by every League member is a blow to imperialism." At the same time, we paid attention to the inspection of work, so that the League's organizations at all levels could play a role; the group leader allocated work according to the strengths of each League member; the branch studied the instructions of the superiors, arranged work in combination with the specific situation, and helped and inspected the work of the group; problems occurring in the work should be reflected in a timely manner, and experiences should be exchanged in a timely manner, especially paying attention to carrying out commendation and criticism through good and bad typical examples occurring in the work. As long as commendation or criticism is carried out in a timely manner, the educational significance will be great, such as League member He Wei from Peking University feeling that the situation was serious and running home. After the Peking University League Committee led the League members to conduct discussions, many League members conducted self-criticism in connection with He Wei's daily performance.
　　In order to consolidate the achievements of the movement and continue to expand and deepen the ideological education of Resist America, Aid Korea, we are preparing to summarize the work of this stage from top to bottom during the winter vacation, and then each League member will conduct discussions or chats based on the summary report of the leadership to encourage the progress of the League members. At the same time, we will organize experience introductions among the cadres, absorb the experiences of many vivid and lively propaganda and education activities that are suitable for the characteristics of young people created in the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country Movement, enrich the organizational life of the Youth League, and improve the work of the League.

　　北京市青年团的组织在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的作用
    青年团北京市委副书记  张大中
    去年十一月间，北京市青年团的组织和广大青年在一起，参加和推动了具有伟大历史意义的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。在运动中，北京市青年团的组织，提高了自己的政治工作水平，并形成为北京市广大青年的团结战斗的核心。
    当美帝国主义把侵略战争的火焰燃烧到我国边境的时候，全国人民掀起了伟大的爱国运动。北京市青年团的组织，立即行动起来，参加了战斗的行列。但开始时有些团员对美帝的认识是模糊的；有些团员缺乏充分的胜利信心。在运动中，通过控诉美帝暴行大会、时事学习和到工厂、农村宣传，青年团员增强了对祖国的热爱和对美帝的仇恨，在行动上展开对隐藏在学校中的反革命分子的斗争。新生中学全体师生团结起来，驱逐了散布谣言的陈德全。盛新女中师生斗争了撕毁标语的帝国主义分子。在运动中，认识了自己的力量，看清了美帝确是纸老虎，大大地长了自己的志气，提高了民族自尊心与自信心。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，锻炼和培养了青年团的干部。在运动前，有些团员的表现和群众差不多；在有些学校和工厂里，经常积极工作的青年团员只有百分之二十左右。随着运动的发展，大部分团员都行动起来了。石景山发电厂有百分之九十五的团员主动做宣传工作。仅据清华、北大、男八中、女一中等三十多个大、中学校的不完全统计，团员和同学在一起就组织了二万一千多人，二百二十个宣传队，前后出动宣传九百一十多次，宣传对象五十七万多人。在宣传工作中，青年团员和同学表现了惊人的创造性，创造了很多奇迹。有些向来不爱发言的人，变成了很好的宣传员：北大团员罗伯鹏到电影院报告四十多次，每次都受到群众的热烈欢迎；有些从来没有上过舞台的人，能在两小时内编排出一个动人的短剧；有的团员成了快板、拉洋片、说相声的能手。《只要山还在》、《青年游击队员》、《仇》等短剧和诗歌。每次演出时观众都很受感动。很多团的干部在群众工作中，也学会了如何研究情况，提出问题。
    过去有些团支部中的团员和群众闹不团结，特别是某些团员有严重脱离群众的现象，经过这次运动以后，不少团员和同学彼此握着手，激动地互相道歉：“我们都是中国人，都在热爱祖国，个人小事不应闹别扭；过去我不对了，请原谅！”特别是在工作中遇到困难时，团员总是站在前面。师大有一个班，团员组织同学跳“纸老虎”舞，没有老虎头，同学有点泄气，团员便连夜把老虎头做了出来。男四中下乡宣传，晚上，团员睡在地上，让同学们睡在炕上，干部晚上还起来给同学盖被子。很多干部、团员为了工作，不顾疲劳，坚决克服困难的精神使群众很感动。很多学校都有人要求入团，清华有八十多人，辅仁有五十多人。很多同学关心团的组织。北大有一个同学写信给一个不起作用的团小组说：“正因为青年团是我们青年人自己的组织，所以我不能不提出意见，要求你们改进工作。”结果教育了团员，很快地把工作搞了起来。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动以前，北京市青年团的组织在生产、学习和工作中发挥了积极作用，但对于团员的思想政治教育却注意不够。有些青年团员不愿做团的工作，不阅读报纸，不关心时事。去年十月中旬举行的青年团北京市第一届代表大会，明确提出：青年团员，首先要思想进步，要用马列主义、毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。每个青年团员，除了搞好生产、学习等本身工作以外，还必须做团的工作；否则青年团就不可能成为党的助手与后备军。因此，很多学校的团员都重新学习了团纲、团章，并检查了自己过去不关心政治和工作的错误。在运动开始时，清华大学团委会把入团誓词印成卡片，发给每一个团员。很多学校、工厂的团员，在工作中想到自己曾站在毛主席的面前宣过誓，想起了“青年团员必须不怕一切困难和牺牲”，“青年团员没有不可克服的困难”，就充满了勇气。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，青年团一方面必须紧密地依靠党的领导，如果没有党的统一领导，多头布置工作，容易形成步调混乱，使工作遭受损失；另一方面又要注意加强团的领导，发挥团的组织作用，使每一个团员了解工作的目的，有一定的工作。开始时，有些学校团的干部全体参加了保卫世界和平反抗美国侵略委员会，担负了各种具体工作，因而放松了支部对团员的领导。这样，团员对工作任务不明确，就动不起来，影响了工作的开展。我们注意到这个问题，给团员布置了三项任务：一、以自己的模范行动，带动群众，完成工作；二、很好地学习时事，并组织群众学习；三、每个团员都随时随地做宣传工作。各基层组织根据不同情况具体掌握。男四中下乡宣传前，给团员提出十项注意。各学校下工厂宣传时，都成立了团的支部或临时小组，及时给团员布置任务。石景山发电厂提出：“宣传工作人人可做”、“每一个团员的每一次宣传，对帝国主义都是打击”。我们同时注意对工作的检查，使团的各级组织发挥作用；小组长根据每个团员的特长分配工作；分支研究上级的指示，结合具体情况布置工作，并帮助与检查小组的工作；在工作中发生的问题要及时反映，经验要及时交流，特别要注意通过工作中发生的好坏典型事例，进行表扬批评。表扬或批评只要进行得及时，教育意义就会很大，如北大团员何炜感到时局严重，逃跑回家，北大团委会领导团员进行讨论后，很多团员联系何炜的日常表现进行了自我检讨。
    为了巩固运动的成果，并继续扩大与加深抗美援朝的思想教育，我们准备在寒假中，从上到下地总结这一阶段的工作，然后每个团员根据领导上的总结报告，进行讨论或漫谈，鼓舞团员进步。同时在干部中，组织经验介绍，把抗美援朝保家卫国运动中创造的很多生动、活泼、适合于青年特点的宣传教育活动的经验，加以吸取，充实青年团的组织生活，改进团的工作。
