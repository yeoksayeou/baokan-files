Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 9th: The French Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "Japan Under American Aggression Plans," which pointed out that Dulles' recent speech at the "America-Japan Society," which stirred up the flames of war in Korea, amounted to an admission of the hope of American imperialism, namely, that Japanese militarists in Asia—like German revanchists in Western Europe—would help expand the war against the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, preparing to launch new provocations through them when the time is right.

The newspaper said: The unbridled actions of American imperialism have forgotten "the basic fact that Japan suffered a complete defeat in 1945 under the heavy blows of the Soviet army; forgotten that great China has been liberated; forgotten that millions of Asian people are fighting for freedom, national liberation, and peace. Following the aggression of the Vietnamese people by the United States and France, the atrocities of American imperialism in invading Korea have opened the eyes of countless people who were previously unaware."

The newspaper pointed out: "The Japanese people sincerely love peace, as evidenced by MacArthur's repressive measures. They do not want American imperialist occupation. Nor do they want their country to become a base against the Soviet Union and China." The newspaper concluded: "The great wind of freedom sweeping the world will sweep away the criminals who dream of maintaining hegemony on the corpses of the people in Asia."

    斥美帝武装日本阴谋
    【新华社布拉格九日电】法国共产党机关报人道报三日在“美国侵略计划下的日本”为题的社论中指出：煽动侵朝战火的杜勒斯最近在“美日协会”上的谈话，等于招认了美帝国主义的希望，即希望日本军国主义者在亚洲——犹如德国复仇主义者在西欧——帮助扩大反对苏联、中国、越南民主共和国的战争，准备在适当时机通过他们进行新的挑衅。
    该报说：美帝国主义肆无忌惮的行为，忘了“一九四五年日本在苏联军队痛击之下遭到彻底失败的基本事实；忘了伟大的中国已获解放；忘了千百万亚洲人民正在为着自由、民族解放与和平而斗争。继美、法侵略越南人民之后的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的暴行，使无数过去不注意的人也睁大了眼睛。”
    该报指出：“日本人民衷心爱好和平，麦克阿瑟的镇压措施也可说明这点。他们不愿美帝国主义占领。他们也不愿意自己的国土成为反苏反中国的基地”。该报结论说：“刮遍全世界的自由大风，将在亚洲把梦想在人民尸体上维持霸权的罪犯们刮倒”。
