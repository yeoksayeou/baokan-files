　　Economic Life Trends
　  Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory Challenges Printing and Dyeing Factories Nationwide
    Responding to the call of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, all employees of the state-owned Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory decided to complete this year's annual production target one month ahead of schedule without working overtime. On February 1st, they issued a friendly production competition challenge to printing and dyeing factories across the country. The challenge content is roughly as follows: 1. Complete the annual production target one month ahead of schedule. 2. Quality must meet the specified standards. 3. Reduce costs by 4% compared to 1950. 4. Eliminate accidents of responsibility. 5. Do a good job in safety work. 6. The entire factory should study culture. 7. Ensure an attendance rate of 97%. 8. Cultivate a model workshop, and each workshop should cultivate a model team.
  　Huaxin Textile Factory Workers Challenge Textile Factories Nationwide
    All the long-day shift workers of the yarn and cloth factories of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, responding to the call of the National Textile Workers' Union of China, have been actively contributing labor and donations to purchase textile-numbered airplanes in the patriotic production competition. They also launched a "Safety Month" campaign, proposing three guarantees (guarantee the elimination of mechanical accidents, guarantee the elimination of work-related injuries and safe production, and guarantee resolute struggle against phenomena that disregard safety and all saboteurs) and three savings (saving oil, saving machine accessories, saving machine parts), challenging textile factories nationwide. The factory's workers have a traditionally excellent reputation for "safety" and "saving."
  Jingxi Coal Mine Strives for the Title of "Capital Coal Mine"
    The four mines and one factory under the Jingxi Mining Bureau of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government put forward the slogan of striving for the title of "Capital Coal Mine" at the mining affairs and labor model conference on January 30th. They also proposed to gradually achieve completely mechanized coal mining in 1951 and to implement the principle of "safety first" to ensure that no one dies or is injured due to accidents.
  Chongqing Completes the 1950 Tax Revenue Task
    The Chongqing Municipal Tax Bureau had a phenomenon of "fighting alone" in its tax work, so by the end of August last year, only 48% of the annual tax revenue task for 1950 had been completed. After September, thanks to the bureau's unity with progressive industrialists and merchants, and the mobilization of the broad masses of shop assistants and the assistance of relevant agencies, tax revenue increased month by month. At the beginning of December, the second municipal tax conference decided to complete the 70 billion yuan tax revenue task within the year, with another 15 billion yuan planned to be collected in January this year. By the end of December, the city had completed a total of 85.9 billion yuan in tax revenue, not only successfully completing the annual tax revenue task, but also exceeding it by more than 800 million yuan.
  　Chen Yupei, Carpenter of Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Mill, Creates a New Shuttle Buffer Device
    Chen Yupei, a carpenter at the Qingdao State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill, has created a new shuttle buffer device, which has made a great contribution to reducing the weaving cost of "Yuanzhou" and "Toyota" looms. The shuttle buffer device of Yuanzhou and Toyota N-type looms consumes a lot of leather rings due to the strong shuttle impact. After adopting the new device created by Chen Yupei, this consumption can be completely avoided. At the same time, the new device reduces the weight of the entire heddle frame by more than six pounds, making it easier to move back and forth, thereby reducing power consumption by nearly 13%. The new shuttle buffer device was successfully developed by Chen Yupei in April last year and has been tested for eight months, proving that it is fully applicable. Recently, the Shanghai State-owned No. 12 Cotton Mill has requested a sample from the factory for adoption.
  　Qixin Yanghui Company Union Promotes the Improvement of Safety and Hygiene Equipment by Capitalists
    After liberation, the union of Tangshan Private Qixin Yanghui Company first led all the workers of the factory to overhaul the machines twice, increasing the output of Yanghui by 52%. By November last year, the output of Yanghui had reached the highest record since the establishment of the factory. With the restoration and development of production, the union, based on the "labor-capital mutual benefit" policy, led all the workers of the factory to conduct a major safety and hygiene inspection, establish a mass safety and hygiene organization, collect workers' opinions on the improvement of factory safety and hygiene, and suggest improvements to the capitalists. Through the efforts of the union, the factory had vaccinated all the workers twice, conducted X-ray examinations once, newly built a health clinic, established a small pharmacy, and issued work clothes, gloves, shoe covers, and glasses to the workers according to their work needs. Three more bathhouses with heating equipment have been added to the factory. The problems of drinking water and steaming food for the workshop workers have also been properly resolved.

  重庆完成一九五○年税收任务
    重庆市税局在税收工作上曾有“孤军作战”的现象，所以到去年八月底止，一九五○年全年的税收任务还只完成百分之四十八。九月以后，由于该局团结了进步的工商业家，并且发动了广大店员群众及各有关机关的协助，税收便逐月增加。十二月初，市二届税务会议决定于年内完成七百亿元税收任务，另外有一百五十亿元计划于今年一月份收齐。到十二月底，全市共完成了八百五十九亿元税款，不仅胜利完成全年税收任务，并且超过了八亿多。
  　青岛第六棉纺厂木工陈玉培创造新式投梭缓冲装置
    青岛国营第六棉纺厂木工陈玉培创造新式投梭缓冲装置，对降低“远洲”式和“丰田”式布机的织布成本，有很大贡献。远洲式和丰田Ｎ式布机的投梭缓冲装置，因投梭冲力很猛，缓冲装置的皮圈等消耗很大。改用陈玉培所创造的新式装置后，这笔消耗就可以完全避免。同时新式装置使整个扣框木减轻六磅多，往来轻便，因而又减少了近百分之十三的电力消耗。新式投梭缓冲装置，于去年四月经陈玉培创制成功后，已经八个月的试验，证明完全适用。最近上海国营第十二棉纺厂已向该厂索取样本，准备采用。
  　启新洋灰公司工会推动资方改善安全卫生设备
