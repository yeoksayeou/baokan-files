Reader's Letters

　　Hubei Xingshan County Leadership Should Improve Propaganda and Education Work Editor:

　　The leadership organs of Xingshan County, Hubei Province, do not pay enough attention to propaganda work, and the masses have many problems in terms of current affairs. It was originally stipulated that all counties should set up blackboard newspapers in rural areas, factories, and various agencies and organizations, and it was decided at the blackboard newspaper conference that new content should be changed every three days, with materials supplied by the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee. When it was first published, it was still timely, but later many blackboard newspapers gradually became a mere formality. For example, the blackboard newspaper in front of the county government had not been published for more than 20 days, and the blackboard newspaper of the People's Factory only changed its content once from December 15 last year to January 21 this year. The bank and the tax bureau change their editions only once every half a month. Many people are unwilling to read the blackboard newspaper. The Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee put aside the current affairs propaganda manual and did not distribute it for more than two months. They also did not study and preserve newspapers very well, and used the People's Daily, Hubei Daily, and Yangtze River Daily to paste walls at will, and posted propaganda posters in the house as decorations. In Huangliangping Community, Gufu District, cadres did not distribute newspapers, pictorials, and slogans to the villages, and used them to paste walls at will. For example, the newspaper transferred from the county to the district on December 29 last year had not been distributed to various villages by January 19 this year. Some village cadres took the newspapers home and threw them away casually, neither reading them nor publicizing them. In this way, the masses could not see the newspapers. At this time, counter-revolutionary elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, causing some people to be unable to concentrate on production. I hope that the leading organs of Xingshan County will correct this phenomenon, pay attention to the people's newspapers, cherish the newspapers, and do not cut off this important bridge connecting the Party, the government, and the people.

　　Shanxi Xiaoyi County People's Government Should Issue Pensions to the Families of Martyrs Editor:

　　I am from Shixiang Village, Third District, Xiaoyi County, Shanxi Province. My younger brother, Feng Zhisong, joined the Fifth Regiment of the Second Column of the Jinxi Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps in 1938, initially serving as a propagandist and later promoted to civil affairs cadre of the regiment. In 1943, he was ordered to go deep into the enemy area (Wencheng area, Shanxi) to do grain collection work, and was unfortunately arrested by the Japanese invaders. Feng Wanping (from this village) and Zhang Shunyu (from Shouyang, Shanxi) were also arrested at the same time. They were subjected to brutal torture by the enemy, but they remained steadfast and unyielding. On July 25, 1943, they were killed by the Japanese invaders with bayonets. Later, Zhang Xiankui, the director of the political department of the original Fifth Regiment of the Second Column, buried them in Zhangjiaoshan, the Seventh District of the eastern suburbs of Jiaocheng.

　　In 1948, my family reported the details of my brother's sacrifice to the Xiaoyi County People's Government, with the testimony of Comrade Feng Jinwen (Feng Wanping's elder brother, who used to work with my brother in the Fifth Regiment of the Second Column). However, the County People's Government only hung a "Glorious Plaque for the Family of Revolutionary Martyrs" on my family's gate, but did not issue the pension grain that my family was entitled to. My family asked the County People's Government why it was not issued, and the County People's Government said: "It will only be issued with a certificate from the original troops and original agency." But when my brother sacrificed, the troops could not issue a certificate; later, the troops changed a lot, and my family could no longer obtain a certificate from the original troops. However, the martyr Feng Wanping, who sacrificed at the same time as my brother, was only certified by his brother, Comrade Feng Jinwen, and the County People's Government issued the pension grain. Why is it not okay for my brother to be certified by Comrade Feng Jinwen? I hope that the Xiaoyi County People's Government will resolve this issue reasonably.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Revolutionary Soldier Feng Baiyou

　　Editor's note: The Provisional Regulations on Commendation and Pensions for Revolutionary Soldiers Sacrificed or Died of Illness stipulate that the families of revolutionary martyrs can receive a one-time pension grain by presenting the "Glorious Memorial Certificate for Families of Revolutionary Soldiers Sacrificed." Since the Xiaoyi County People's Government has issued the "Glorious Plaque for the Family of Revolutionary Martyrs" to Feng Zhisong's family, acknowledging them as the family of a revolutionary martyr, then it should not refuse to issue preferential treatment grain under the pretext of not having a certificate from the original troops.

　　The Order of Tangshan Bus Terminal is Chaotic Editor:

　　The working system of Tangshan Bus Terminal is very chaotic, and the buses are extremely crowded. I think it should be improved in the following aspects.

　　First, since the station has many routes and two ticket windows, it should be clearly marked which window sells tickets for which route and which bus is going to which route, so as to avoid passengers asking around and disrupting the order. Second, the bus is parked on the street outside the station, and passengers get on the bus without checking tickets. People who don't buy tickets can also get on the bus, but sometimes people who buy tickets can't get on the bus. When arriving at the final station, the ticket collector does not strictly collect tickets, and people who take advantage of the situation often get away with it. On December 29 last year, I saw a passenger on the bus muttering to himself that his ticket was lost, but when he arrived at Wolugu, he left when there were many people getting off the bus and it was chaotic. This is just one example. The ticket seller at the station has no contact with the driver on the bus, and sometimes the bus leaves before the tickets are sold out. Third, there is no regulation on the maximum capacity of each bus. Each bus often carries 50 or 60 people. The bus is already extremely crowded, and the people at this station still say: "Get on, there will be room when you get to the top." The bus shed and the stove are also often turned into passenger seats, and women and children in the bus often cry and scream because they are squeezed. The station's purely profit-seeking view, which disregards the safety of passengers, should be corrected.

　　We Should Resolutely Help Peasants to Overturn Editor:

　　After reading the news and short commentary in the People's Daily on February 9 about Ge Feng, secretary of the headquarters of the East China Air Force Preparatory Corps, losing his position and shielding landlords, I am very resentful of Ge Feng's behavior. It is an extremely shameful act for a revolutionary cadre to use his revolutionary work position and steal the official seal of the revolutionary agency to intimidate peasants and shield landlords.

　　From this incident, we can see that there are many tricks for landlords to resist or sabotage land reform. One of them is to use their children or relatives who are now in revolutionary work positions to shield them. For example, my father, he is also a landlord. When he was being liquidated by the masses in his hometown, he also wrote to me and clamored. Landlords like my father are relatively easy to confuse us. He used to scold others for "it is not right to ask for eight dou of interest for lending one dan of grain," but she herself only asked for six dou of interest for lending one dan of grain. She also often promotes this "benevolence" to peasants and her children.

　　However, one thing is obvious: he is a member of the landlord class, he lives by feudal exploitation, and he wants to resist land reform.

　　Now, a vigorous land reform movement is being carried out in the vast areas of East China and Central South. Revolutionary workers from landlord families should seriously study the relevant land reform policies and laws, and improve their own awareness. We must resolutely sympathize with and help the peasants to overturn, and not shield the landlords (even if they are our own fathers), so as to achieve the purpose of resisting or sabotaging land reform.

    湖北兴山县领导机关  应改进宣传教育工作编辑同志：
    湖北兴山县领导机关，由于不重视宣传工作，群众在时事上存在很多问题。原规定全县在农村，工厂及各机关、团体都设黑板报，并在黑板报会议上决定每三天换一次新内容，由县委宣传部供给材料。开始出版时还及时，后来不少黑板报逐渐流于形式了。如县政府门前的黑板报二十多天没有出版，人民工厂的黑板报从去年十二月十五日到今年元月二十一日才换了一次内容，银行、税务局都是半个多月换一次版。很多人都不愿意看黑板报。县委宣传部把时事宣传手册放着不管，两个多月不发下去。对报纸也不很好学习和保存，把人民日报、湖北日报、长江日报随便用来糊墙，把宣传画贴在屋里当装饰品。古夫区黄粮坪小区，干部将报纸、画刊和标语等不向村里发，随便用来糊墙。如去年十二月二十九日由县里转到该区的报纸，到今年一月十九日还未分发到各村。有些村干部把报纸带回家去随便一扔，自己不看也不宣传。这样，群众就都看不到报纸了。而反革命分子这时却钻空子造谣，引起一些群众不能安心生产。我希望兴山县领导机关纠正这种现象，重视人民的报纸，爱惜报纸，不要把党、政府与人民群众联系的这一重要桥梁割断。

  山西孝义县人民政府  应发给烈属抚恤粮编辑同志：
    我是山西省孝义县三区石像村人。我胞弟冯芝松于一九三八年参加晋西青年抗敌决死第二纵队第五团，初任宣传员，后升任该团民运干事。一九四三年，他奉令深入敌区（山西文城一带）做征粮工作，不幸被日寇逮捕。同时被捕的还有冯万平同志（本村人）和张顺玉同志（山西寿阳人）。他们受到敌人毒刑拷打，但始终坚贞不屈，一九四三年七月二十五日，便被日寇用刺刀杀死。后来原第二纵队第五团政治处主任张献奎同志把他们葬在交城东郊七区张交山地。
    一九四八年，我家把我弟弟牺牲经过向孝义县人民政府报告，并有冯进文同志（冯万平的哥哥，他过去和我弟弟同在第二纵队第五团工作）证明。但县人民政府却只给我家大门上挂了一块“革命烈士家属光荣牌”，却不发给我家应得之抚恤粮。我家问县人民政府为什么不发，县人民政府说：“要有原部队、原机关的证明才发。”但我弟弟牺牲时，部队无法发给证明；以后部队变化很大，我家已无法取得原部队证明。而和我弟弟同时牺牲的烈士冯万平也只经其兄冯进文同志证明，县人民政府就发了抚恤粮。为什么我弟弟经冯进文同志证明就不行呢？希望孝义县人民政府合理解决这个问题。

    编者按：革命军人牺牲、病故褒恤暂行条例规定：革命烈士家属可凭“革命牺牲军人家属光荣纪念证”颁取抚恤粮一次。孝义县人民政府既已发给冯芝松的家属“革命烈士家属光荣牌”，承认其为革命烈士家属；那么，就不应该再以没有原部队证明为借口而拒不发给优抚粮。
  唐山汽车总站秩序乱编辑同志：
    唐山汽车总站工作制度很混乱，车上拥挤不堪，我觉得应该从如下几个方面加以改进。
    一、该站既有很多路线，有两个卖票的窗口，应该标明那个窗口是卖那一路线的票，那辆汽车是开往那条路线的，以免乘客东询西问，紊乱秩序。二、汽车停在站外的街道上，旅客上车又不验票，不买票的也可以上车，而有时买了票的反而上不了车。到达最终站时，乘客下车，收票员收票也不严格，常被取巧的人钻了空子。去年十二月二十九日，我在车上见到一个客人自言自语说票丢了，可是到了窝洛沽，在下车人多杂乱时，他就走了，这仅是一个例子。车站卖票的与车上司机毫无联系，有时票未卖完车就开走了。三、没有规定每辆车的最高容纳量，每辆车经常装五、六十人，本来车上已拥挤不堪，本站上的人还说：“上吧，到上边就挤出地方来了。”车棚、车炉上也经常变为乘客的座位，车内妇女小孩时常挤的啼哭喊叫。该站这种不顾旅客安全的单纯营利观点，是应该纠正的。

    应坚决帮助农民翻身编辑同志：
    读了二月九日人民日报关于华东空军预科总队司令部秘书葛风丧失立场包庇地主的消息和短评以后，我对于葛风的行为很痛恨。一个革命干部竟利用革命工作岗位，并盗用革命机关的公章来进行恫吓农民包庇地主的勾当，这实在是万分可耻的行为。
    从这件事情里，我们可以看出地主抗拒或破坏土地改革的花样是很多的。其中的一种，就是利用现在革命工作岗位上的子弟或亲友来进行包庇。比如我的父亲，他也是一个地主，当他被本乡群众清算时，他也曾来信向我叫嚣过。像我父亲这样的地主，本来是比较容易迷糊我们的，他曾经骂别人“放一担谷子不应该要八斗利息”，她自己放一担谷子又确确实实地只要六斗利息，他又常常向农民和他的子女们宣传这种“仁慈”。
    然而有一点是明显的：他是地主阶级的一分子，他靠着封建剥削过日子，他想抗拒土地改革。
    现在华东、中南的广大地区正进行着轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，凡从地主家庭出身的革命工作者，更应该认真学习有关土地改革的政策与法令，提高自己的觉悟。我们要坚决的同情与帮助农民翻身，而不要包庇地主（即使是自己的父亲），使之达到抗拒或破坏土地改革的目的。
