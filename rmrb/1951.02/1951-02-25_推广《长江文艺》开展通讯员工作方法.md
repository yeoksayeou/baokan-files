　　To the Editor:

　　I was very excited after reading "How does 'Yangtze River Literature' develop correspondent work?" in the 86th issue of "People's Literature" and the editor's note.

　　Recently, I read the first issue of Volume Four of "Yangtze River Literature," especially after reading the article "‘Yangtze River Literature’ and Me" by farmer correspondent Li Wenyuan and the article "Spurring and Encouragement," I admire the editorial department comrades who patiently cultivate and educate correspondents even more. How much I hope to become a correspondent!

　　The process of farmer correspondent Li Wenyuan learning to write from not knowing how to write is inseparable from the help of the editorial department comrades, as he himself said: "Looking back on the past year, from not understanding how to use words to publishing works, this is entirely due to the help of the editorial department. The educational methods you adopted, which were patient and tailored to the needs of the individual, have enabled me to make progress unconsciously, and I will never forget the benefits you have given me." "Now there is a school without tuition fees - our editorial department, why not study?"

　　The "Spurring and Encouragement" column publishes letters from a small portion of the more than 800 correspondents, reporting on their progress over the past year and expressing their gratitude for the help of the editorial department. The feelings between them are so sincere and close.

　　Literary youths and beginner writers are an important force in the future of New China's literature and art. It is not enough to rely on just a few specialized schools for training. Literary magazines extensively developing correspondents and patiently cultivating and educating them are good methods for cultivating the younger generation of literary workers and closely contacting the masses, and will improve the people's political and cultural level in this close contact.

　　However, just one or a few magazines are not enough. All national literary magazines and publications must take on this responsibility and study and adopt this method in a timely manner. Literary youths and beginner writers are waiting to be your correspondents!

### 推广《长江文艺》开展通讯员工作方法

　　推广《长江文艺》开展通讯员工作方法
    编辑同志：
    读了《人民文艺》第八十六期《〈长江文艺〉是怎样开展通讯员工作的？》和编者按语后很兴奋。
    最近又读了《长江文艺》四卷一期，特别是读了农民通讯员李文元的《〈长江文艺〉和我》一文，和《鞭策与鼓励》一文后，更使人敬爱这样耐心培养、教育通讯员的编辑部同志。我是多么希望当上个通讯员啊！
    农民通讯员李文元从不会写稿到慢慢地学会创作的过程，是和编辑部同志的帮助分不开的，正如他自己所说：“回忆过去一年来从不懂用词到发表作品，这中间完全得力于编辑部的帮助，你们采取的循循善诱，对症下药的教育方式，使我不知不觉中得到了进步，这使我永远也不能忘记你们对我的好处。”“现在有不纳学费的学校——我们的编辑部，为什么不学习呢？”
    “鞭策与鼓励”栏里是发表了八百多通讯员中一小部分的来信，报告了一年来自己的进步，并表示了对编辑部帮助的感谢，相互间的感情是那样真诚密切。
    文艺青年和初学写作者，是新中国文艺未来的重要力量，只靠几个专门学校来培养是很不够的。文艺杂志大量开展通讯员和耐心培养教育，是培养年青一代文艺工作者及和群众密切联系的良好方法，并会在这一密切联系中提高人民政治文化水平。
    不过仅有一个或几个杂志是不够的，须全国文艺杂志刊物都担负起这个责任来，及时研究并采用这种方法。文艺青年和初学写作者在等待作你们的通讯员！
