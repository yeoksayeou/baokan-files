　　Formalism Tendencies in Primary School Education in Nanchang City
　　-- Abstract of Submission from the Nanchang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education
    In the past year, primary school education in Nanchang City has made some achievements in reforming old education and establishing new democratic education. For example, a democratic system has been initially established, students' conscious and active learning spirit has improved, teachers have paid attention to improving the quality of teaching, and the political awareness of teachers and students has also been raised. However, there is still a relatively common shortcoming in school work, that is, some work does not honestly start from the actual work to study and improve methods, but mainly satisfies formalism.
    I. In terms of extracurricular activities, extracurricular activities are necessary, but due to insufficient understanding of this type of activity, there has been a tendency to "put on a show." Some schools mistakenly believe that the Communist Party's education policy only emphasizes engaging in activities, and therefore spend too much time and energy on twisting Yangko dances, engaging in labor, performing plays, practicing singing, producing beautiful wall newspapers, and practicing sports performances. Huiminmen Primary School had children practice Peking Opera for a semester in order to hold a parent-teacher conference. Some schools prepared for two months just to hold a sports meeting. Some schools believe that waist drums and foreign drums are more important than books (schools lack new children's books), thinking that without waist drums, they cannot maintain appearances. Some schools occupy extracurricular homework time, or let students come to school to practice after dinner, without considering the students' physical and mental health and academic performance.
    II. In terms of teaching, students have a wide variety of assignments (large and small characters, compositions, weekly journals, composition transcription, checking new words, explaining the meaning of words and sentences, writing the purpose of the text, paragraph summaries, and reading notes, various subjects have tables, notes, and questions and answers), with little regard for students' time, and little checking of the effectiveness of various homework exercises and corrections. Some schools even do not return the exercises to students, but keep them with the teacher, preparing for an exhibition. When they are returned, students only look at the scores and rarely carefully study the content of the corrections. Some teachers extract brief notes for students, or copy some supplementary materials unrelated to the text, and have the children write them down in order to cope with exams. Teachers' lesson preparation generally only involves reading the text once and checking new words, then copying down the meanings of words and sentences and writing them for students. Encouraging students' learning interest and checking students' effectiveness are done poorly, relying solely on scores and competitions to stimulate students, which obscures the students' learning purpose.
    III. In terms of management, in order to maintain good school order, some schools adopt methods of suppression, such as deducting points, punishments, and collective sanctions, to replace teachers' persuasion and education. Some use the method of increasing students' homework, so that students have no way to play or make noise. Students have many meetings, including class chairman joint meetings, group leader joint meetings, class meetings, self-criticism meetings, group discussion meetings, Young Pioneer team days, weekly meetings, and student representative meetings. Each meeting discusses many methods, but few can be achieved.
    Some teachers do not seek progress in political cultivation and professional research, and do not actively study teaching methods. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a revolutionary view of being fully responsible for students, and it is also difficult to establish prestige among students. Some teachers only teach students with slogans and dogmas, and students only learn to recite political slogans and cannot understand problems in real life.
    IV. In terms of administrative leadership, some school administrators and some teachers have the idea that "family scandals should not be exposed," fearing that others will know the school's shortcomings and lacking the spirit of adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes. Therefore, within the school, they maintain a state of harmony. For example, several teachers often play together and eat things together, which is considered unity; helping a teacher correct a few assignments or doing something else is considered mutual assistance. In reality, they often have opinions of each other but are unwilling to raise them. When introducing experiences and reporting work to the leadership, they only report good news and not bad, and even when reporting bad news, they reduce the weight. Some leaders believe that as long as the number of classes is increased and school buildings are added, it counts as achievement. Shuyuan Street Primary School desperately pulls students from neighboring schools, bringing some students who have only completed the third grade to read the fifth grade, resulting in students not being able to keep up with their studies. Administrative leadership does not pay attention to helping teachers improve politically and professionally, but is only busy with some trivial issues in teaching. As a result, many teachers work with the idea of "getting by."
    V. In terms of teacher learning, teacher learning only focuses on formally complying with the learning system and does not pay attention to actual learning effectiveness. Group leaders leading learning only rigidly transmit downwards according to the leadership's arrangements. Some group leaders only play a role in chairing the rotation of speeches. After finishing their speeches, the teachers run off to correct homework, resulting in a phenomenon of learning for the sake of complying with the system and writing outlines for the sake of coping with inspections, to the point of treating learning as a burden. Last semester, for a learning test, some teachers crammed at the last minute, neglecting their work and reading documents to death, even taking "sick leave" for two days to prepare for the exam. Such learning, of course, cannot be linked to actual work.
    Regarding the above shortcomings, the Bureau of Culture and Education should first review that its assistance to schools is not enough, especially in teacher learning, which has only begun to be emphasized this semester. At the same time, the school's leadership itself should overcome formalistic tendencies and establish a pragmatic style of thinking.
    Extracurricular activities should be combined with children's classroom learning to cultivate children's healthy bodies. Through various activities, children can experience the real situation of society and cultivate diverse interests and talents. Various legitimate recreational activities should be carried out around this goal. In the past month, attention has been paid to students' normal learning, and non-special activities should not affect children's regular classes.
    In terms of teaching, lesson preparation should be strengthened. In addition to being familiar with the textbook, teachers should also appropriately enrich the teaching content by combining it with teaching materials that are easily understood by children in their daily lives and local teaching materials. The number of homework items does not need to be large, and the emphasis should be on checking the effect.
    In terms of administrative leadership, leading comrades must pay attention to improving their own political and professional level. First of all, they should understand educational policies and be familiar with the business, and they should also be good at uniting and using existing forces to carry out work in a step-by-step manner. Use various methods to absorb mass opinions, understand the overall situation and existing problems, in order to correct shortcomings and smoothly carry out teaching work.

　　南昌市小学教育中的形式主义倾向
　  ——南昌市文教局来稿摘要
    南昌市小学教育工作，一年来在改革旧的教育，建立新民主主义教育的基础上，有了一些成绩。如初步建立了民主制度，学生自觉自动学习的精神有了进步，老师注意提高教学的质量，师生的政治觉悟也提高了。但是目前在学校工作中还存在着一个比较普遍的缺点，即有些工作不是老老实实的从实际工作出发，研究改进办法，而主要是满足于形式。
    一、在课外活动方面，课外活动是需要的，但因对这种活动认识不够，发生了“装门面”的偏向。一部分学校，错认为共产党的教育方针是只重视搞活动，因而把过多的时间和力量用在扭秧歌、搞劳动、演戏、练歌、出漂亮的壁报和练习体育表演等上面。惠民门小学为了开家长会，儿童练习了一个学期的京剧。有的学校为了开一个运动会，竟准备了二个来月。有的学校认为腰鼓、洋鼓，比图书更重要（学校缺少新的儿童读物），以为没有腰鼓就撑不起门面。有些学校，便占用了课外作业的时间，或让学生晚饭后来校练习，并不考虑学生的身心健康和学业。
    二、在教学方面，学生的作业名目繁多（大小字、作文、周记、作文謄清、查生字、解词句意义、写课文宗旨、段落大意和读后感，各科有表解、笔记、和问答），很少估计学生的时间，也很少检查各项课业练习和批改后的效果。有的学校甚至不把练习发还学生，而保存在老师这儿，准备开展览会。发回去的，学生也只是看一下记的分数，很少仔细研究批改内容的。有的老师给学生摘一些简要的笔记，或抄一些与课文不相联的补充材料，让儿童记下来，以应付考试。老师的课前准备一般也只能做到看一遍课文，查查生字，然后照抄下词句的意义再写给学生。鼓励学生的学习兴趣和检查学生的效果，做得很差，专凭分数和比赛去刺激学生，这样就模糊了学生学习的目的。
    三、在管理方面，为要搞好学校秩序，有的学校采取压制的方法，如扣分、处罚、集体制裁等来代替老师的说服教育。有的用加重学生作业的办法，使学生没有办法去玩去闹。学生的会议很多，有级主席联席会、小组长联席会、级会、检讨会，小组讨论会、少年队队日、周会、学生代表会，每个会议都讨论了很多办法，但能做到的不多。
    有些老师不在政治修养和业务研究上求进步，不主动钻研教学方法，因此，很难建立起对学生全面负责的革命观点，也很难在学生中建立起威信来。有些老师只以口号和教条教学生，学生也就只学会了背政治口号，不能理解现实生活中的问题。
    四、在行政领导方面，一部分学校的行政领导人和一部分教师，存在着家丑不可外扬的思想，怕人家知道学校的缺点，缺乏坚持真理修正错误的精神。所以在校内是保持一团和气，例如几个老师经常在一起玩，吃东西，就算团结；替某个老师改了几本作业或做了一点旁的什么事，就算互助，实际上常是互相有意见而不肯提出。对外介绍经验和向领导机关汇报工作，只是报喜不报忧，即是报坏也要减轻分量。有的领导人，认为只要增加了班次，添建了校舍，就算是成绩。书院街小学拼命的拉邻校的学生，把一些只读了三年级的学生，拉来读五年级，结果学生功课赶不上。行政领导上不重视帮助教师在政治上、业务上的提高，只忙于教学中的一部分枝节问题。结果很多老师都抱着“交差”的思想进行工作。
    五、在教师学习方面，教师的学习仅仅注重在形式上遵守学习制度，不注意实际的学习效果。小组长领导学习只是死板的根据领导上的布置向下传。有的小组长只起了一个主持轮流发言的作用，发完了言的老师，就跑去改作业，结果形成了为遵守制度而学习，为应付检查而写提纲的现象，以至把学习当成负担。上学期为了一次学习测验，有的老师临时抱佛脚，放松了工作，去死读文件，甚至有请“病假”两天，专准备考试的。这样的学习，当然谈不到与实际工作联系了。
    以上的缺点，文教局首先应检讨自己对学校的帮助还不够，尤其在教师学习方面，从这个学期才开始重视。同时学校本身领导上应克服形式主义偏向，树立实事求是的思想作风。
    课外活动应结合儿童课内学习，培养儿童健康的身体，通过各种活动，使儿童体会社会真实情况，并培养多方面的兴趣和才能。各种正当的文娱活动，都应围绕这一目标进行。最近一个月来注意了学生正常的学习，非特殊的活动不能影响儿童正课。
    教学方面，要加强课前准备，老师除了熟悉课本外，还应结合儿童在日常生活上所易理解的教材和乡土教材来适当地充实教学内容。课业练习项目不必多，应着重检查效果。
    在行政领导上，领导同志必须注意本身政治业务水平的提高。首先，应了解教育方针、教育政策并熟悉业务，还应善于团结使用现有的力量以有步骤地开展工作。用各种方式吸取群众意见，了解全面情况及存在的问题，以改正缺点，顺利进行教学工作。
