            Nationwide Movement in France Against Arming West Germany Expands
    The massive protest movement against Eisenhower's presence in Paris has further strengthened the nationwide protest movement in France against rearming West Germany. According to the French newspaper *L'Humanité*, over 87,000 people in the Seine-et-Oise department—that is, 90 to 100 percent of all workers in many factories in the department—have signed protest letters against rearming West Germany. City councils in twenty cities in the department have unanimously passed resolutions protesting the rebuilding of the Nazi Wehrmacht.
            U.S. Orders Western European Countries to Expand Local Airports
    The *People's Daily* correspondent in London, the Netherlands, reports that the U.S. government is asking Britain to hand over to the United States the use of certain British airfields outside of the UK. First, the United States is requesting the use of airports on the island of Cyprus. The reporter also stated that the United States is providing funds to countries to expand their airports. Airports near Rome and Athens, as well as on the islands of Rhodes and Crete, are being expanded with U.S. dollars. Portugal has received approximately one million U.S. dollars from the United States to expand five airports in Portuguese East Africa.
            Italian People Launch "Anti-Conscription" Movement
    Recently, the Italian Ministry of Defense, acting on orders from the U.S. government, issued 100,000 so-called "notices" to veterans, ordering them to report "information" to military districts so that they could be drafted into the army in the event of "military mobilization." However, the veterans have returned these notices unopened.
    The Italian National Peace Committee issued a statement on the matter, pointing out that the government's preparation to conscript veterans is the result of Eisenhower's visit to Italy, and called on veterans and their relatives and the people of the country to send collectively signed letters to members of parliament and political, religious, cultural, and social authorities, and to send delegations to visit them, in order to express the people's firm demand for peace and to ensure that the constitutional provision prohibiting Italy from using war to resolve international conflicts is fully implemented. The people of Florence have responded to the call of the Italian National Peace Committee. They held rallies and sent protests to the Minister of Defense. The Italian government has been alarmed by this "anti-conscription" movement and is very afraid of its expansion.
            MacDonald Admits British Imperialism's Failure in Malaya
    Recently, British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia Malcolm MacDonald, who was visiting Burma, admitted to journalists in Rangoon that the British army in Malaya had not achieved any victories in its war against the Malayan National Liberation Army. MacDonald admitted that, apart from the main densely populated areas in Malaya, 75 percent of the territory was in fact under the control of the Malayan National Liberation Army. The British *Times of London* also believes that the situation in Malaya is "serious."
            Soviet Sports Delegation Leaves Harbin to Return Home

    反对艾森豪威尔驻留巴黎的巨大抗议运动，已使法国全国反对重新武装西德的抗议运动更为强大。法国《人道报》讯：在塞纳——瓦斯省，已有八万七千多人——即该省许多工厂中全体劳动人民的百分之九十至一百——在反对重新武装西德的抗议书上签了名。该省已有二十个市的市议会一致通过决议，抗议重建纳粹国防军。
            美令西欧各国扩大各地机场
    荷兰《人民报》驻伦敦记者报道：美国政府要求英国把某些在英国本土以外的英国飞机场交美国使用。首先，美国要求使用塞浦路斯岛上的机场。记者又称：美国正供给各国经费去扩充它们的机场。罗马和雅典的近郊以及罗德岛和克里特岛上的机场，正在用美元来加以扩大。葡萄牙从美国得到了一百万左右的美元，来扩大葡属东非的五个飞机场。
            意人民展开“反征召”运动
    最近意大利国防部曾奉美国政府之命，把十万份所谓“通知书”发给退伍军人，命令他们向军区报告“情况”，以便一旦实行“军事动员”时征召他们入伍。但是退伍军人们都纷纷把这些通知书原封退回。
    意大利全国和平委员会特为此事发表声明，指出政府准备征召退伍军人入伍之举，是艾森豪威尔赴意活动的结果，并号召退伍军人及其亲友与全国人民向议会议员及政治、宗教、文化和社会各方面的权威人士发出集体签名的信件，并派代表团访问他们，以便表示人民坚决要求和平，他们一定要使宪法不准意大利用战争来解决国际矛盾的规定彻底付诸实施。佛罗伦萨的人民已响应意大利全国和平委员会的号召。他们举行集会，并向国防部长发出了抗议书。意大利政府已被这种“反征召”运动弄得惊慌失措，并十分害怕其扩大。
