How to Carry Out Propaganda Work Among Urban Residents
　　Shang Kai
    Establishing an urban street propaganda network and carrying out propaganda work among residents is still a new topic at present. At the same time, urban residents have complex compositions, and the number of Party members and Youth League members in the streets is relatively small. Therefore, launching this work is difficult. However, according to the experience of Northeast China, the difficulties in establishing a street propaganda network and carrying out propaganda work among residents can be overcome.
    Because urban residents are of complex composition, the selection of street propagandists and the establishment of propaganda networks should be more cautious; otherwise, it is easy to create impure organizations. For example, among the one thousand and thirty-two street propagandists in six districts of Shenyang, only twenty-one were Party members and Youth League members, one hundred and fifty-two had unclear occupations, and some were even reactionary Party and League members, heads of Yiguandao, and third-generation preachers.
    According to the existing experience in Northeast China, a better way to establish street propagandists is to select propagandists from the Party branches of resident organizations and street Party members and Youth League members in combination. For example, in Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, during the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the method of combining the Party branches of organizations with street Party members, Youth League members, and activists to carry out propaganda to residents was adopted, and the results were very good. However, some organizations in the city had a tendency to affect the progress of organizational work because many cadres were doing street propaganda work, which should be prevented. Therefore, urban Party committees should often pay attention to selecting street Party members, Youth League members, and activists as propagandists, establish street propaganda networks, and always pay attention to cultivating some activists who do not yet have the conditions to be propagandists for future use. At the same time, the Party branches of various organizations should pay attention to selecting a certain number of Party members, Youth League members, and activists from their organizations to participate in the propaganda work of street residents. The time for organizational propagandists to carry out propaganda activities can be stipulated to be carried out in their spare time.
    The street propaganda network is under the unified leadership of the urban Party committee. The organizational branches should regularly supervise and inspect the work of the propagandists of their organizations. The urban Party committee should also establish close contact with the organizational branches stationed within its district, and regularly convene meetings or representative meetings of organizational branch propagandists and street propagandists to summarize the work of the propagandists, exchange experiences, and discuss the propaganda content and tasks for a certain period. In order to combine the residents' propaganda work with the administrative work of various organizations, the organizations can also appropriately divide the work. For example, the organizational branches of the Public Security Bureau can share the propaganda to general residents; the organizational branches of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, and other organizations can share the propaganda to industrialists and businessmen, and so on.
    The basic ways to conduct propaganda to urban residents should be small-scale forums and individual visits. Because urban residents have different occupations, different social statuses, and different living standards and schedules, they are not related to each other and do not interact with each other; therefore, street propagandists can hold small-scale forums separately according to the different residential areas, occupations, and social statuses of the residents. For women with children, elderly people who are inconvenient to move, people who cannot attend small-scale forums for some reason, or people with relatively special ideological situations, the propagandists should conduct individual visits. Small-scale forums and individual visits are more flexible and easier for residents to accept; at the same time, in the conversation, the propagandists can deeply understand the residents' thoughts, emotions, and demands, so that they can solve the various ideological problems among the residents more realistically. In Northeast China, many street propagandists use methods such as kang-head meetings, forums, and individual conversations for propaganda, and the effect is very good. In addition, according to the characteristics of urban residents with higher cultural levels and concentrated residences, in the case of coordinating a certain movement and carrying out large-scale mass ideological education, the use of organizing worker and student propaganda teams, dispatching propaganda vehicles, holding street costumed propaganda, convening mass meetings, and other propaganda methods can indeed play a certain role. Of course, relying solely on these cannot make street propaganda universal and in-depth.

　　怎样开展对城市居民的宣传工作
　　商恺
    建立城市街道宣传网，开展居民宣传工作，在目前还是一个新的课题。同时城市居民成份复杂，街道党员和团员人数较少，因此，展开这一工作是有困难的。但是根据东北的经验，建立街道宣传网，开展居民宣传工作的困难，是有办法克服的。
    由于城市居民成份复杂，所以建立街道宣传员、宣传网，应该更要慎重；否则容易造成组织不纯。如沈阳市六个区的一千零三十二个街道宣传员中，党团员只有二十一人，职业不明的就有一百五十二人，其中甚至还有反动党团分子、一贯道首和三辈传教师。
    根据东北现有的经验，建立街道宣传员较好的办法，是在驻地机关的党支部与街道党团员中，结合着选拔宣传员。如黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市，在抗美援朝运动中，即是采用机关党支部与街道党团员、积极分子结合着向居民进行宣传的办法，收效很大。不过该市有些机关，因很多干部去做街道宣传工作，而影响机关业务进行的偏向，是应注意防止的。因此，城市党委要经常注意选拔街道党团员、积极分子作宣传员，建立街道宣传网，并随时注意培养一些尚不具备做宣传员条件的积极分子，以后做宣传员。同时，各机关党支部应该注意选拔本机关一定数量党团员与积极分子，参加街道居民的宣传工作。机关宣传员进行宣传活动的时间，可规定在业余时间去进行。
    街道宣传网，由城市党委统一领导。机关支部要经常督促检查本机关宣传员的工作。城市党委亦要与在本区范围内驻扎的各机关支部建立密切联系，并定期召开机关支部宣传员和街道宣传员大会或代表会，总结宣传员工作，交流经验，讨论一定时期的宣传内容和任务。为了使居民宣传工作与各机关行政业务相结合，各机关亦可适当的分工，如公安局的机关支部，可分担对一般居民的宣传；工商局、税务局等机关支部可分担对工商业者的宣传等等。
    对城市居民进行宣传的方式，基本的应该采取小型座谈会与个别访问的方式。因为城市居民之间职业不同、社会地位不同、生活水平和作息时间不同，以致互不关联，不相往来；因而，街道宣传员可按照居民居住的区域不同、职业与社会地位不同分别召开小型座谈会。而对有小孩的妇女，年迈不便行动的老人，有某种原因不能参加小型座谈会的人，或者思想情况比较特殊的人，宣传员即应进行个别访问。小型座谈与个别访问的方式都比较灵活，居民容易接受；同时在谈话中，宣传员可以深入的了解居民的思想、情绪与要求，这样可以更切合实际的解决居民中的各种思想问题。在东北有不少城市的街道宣传员，都是采用炕头会、座谈会、个别谈话等方式进行宣传的，效果很好。此外，根据城市居民文化水平较高，居住的集中等特点，在配合某一运动，进行大规模的群众思想教育情况下，使用组织工人、学生宣传队，出动宣传车，举行街道化装宣传，召开群众大会等等宣传方式，确实能起其一定的作用的。当然单单依靠这些，是不能使街道宣传进行的普遍与深入的。
