　　China's Great Contributions to Astronomy in Ancient Times
　　Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
　　In the development of culture among all nations of the world, astronomy is always one of the earliest sciences to develop. Whether agricultural or nomadic, peoples must arrange their lives and determine their actions according to the cycle of the seasons. Peoples who live by the sea must know the position of stars and the sun to know the direction in the vast sea. Since human life cannot escape space and time, all nations with highly developed cultures must have rich astronomical knowledge. The most developed nations in ancient astronomy were Babylon, India, Greece, and China. However, in the past, those in capitalist countries who wrote about the history of astronomy mostly praised Babylon and Greece, and despised China's great achievements in astronomy. On the one hand, this was due to the fact that Western writers on astronomy did not understand Chinese characters. But even those who claimed to be experts on China also disdained China's ancient astronomical achievements and were unwilling to praise them. For example, John Chalmers, a British missionary in the mid-nineteenth century, wrote "An Account of the Ancient Chinese Astronomy," and attributed all of China's ancient creations in astronomy to being transmitted from India and Babylon. There were also a few scholars, such as the Dutchman Schlegel, the author of "Uranographie Chinoise," who misunderstood Chinese classics and pushed the history of Chinese astronomy back to 16,000 years ago, believing that much of Western astronomical knowledge originated in China. This is also an exaggeration. If we study the history of the development of world science with a realistic attitude, China's ancient achievements in astronomy have their own brilliant and outstanding contributions, which are worthy of our exploration and promotion.
　　China's ancient achievements in astronomy differ from those of Babylon and Greece in two points. First, we focus on practicality. Many of our achievements in astronomy were obtained to meet practical needs. In the same period, our theory may not have been as advanced as that of Greece, but our application of technology surpassed them. Second, we have a long history, with continuous records, discoveries, and creations in each era. If we divide the history of the development of Chinese astronomy into three periods, namely (1) from the Yin and Zhou Dynasties to the Two Han and Three Kingdoms (2) from the Six Dynasties to the Tang Dynasty (3) from the Five Dynasties to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, then each era had outstanding talents who were continuously working, and only then could they create our ancient great contributions in astronomy.
　　In the first period, our greatest contribution was in calendrical science. Since the Yin Ruins era, we have been an agricultural society. The law of the four seasons and the cycle of cold and heat has a decisive effect on the cultivation, growth, and harvesting of agricultural products. It is necessary to grasp the law of cold and heat in order to do a good job in agricultural products. The difference of ten days in the early or late planting of rice, wheat, and grains often makes the farmer's hard work for a year a success or failure. In the past, poisoned by imperialist propaganda, we always thought that the solar calendar was transmitted from the West, and that the ancient Western calendar was more precise and advanced than China's. This is completely wrong. We can see from the oracle bone inscriptions that the Yin Dynasty three thousand years ago already had the names of thirteen months. The Book of Documents, Yao Dian, says: "There are three hundred and sixty-six days, and a leap month is used to determine the four seasons to complete the year." The so-called three hundred and sixty-six days is the solar year, and using a leap month to determine the four seasons to complete the year is the combined use of the lunar and solar calendars. In the West, in the Babylonian era or the Greek and Roman eras, the lunar and solar calendars were also used together, which was originally the same as in China. However, in the same era, our calendar was more advanced than that of Greece and Rome. Mencius, in the Li Lou chapter, said: "The height of the sky, the distance of the stars, if one seeks their cause, the arrival of the solstice a thousand years hence can be determined while sitting." The ancients called the winter solstice and summer solstice the solstices. As Mencius said, in the Warring States period, we had a very good grasp of measuring the length of the solar year. In the West, by the end of our Western Han Dynasty, the calendar was still very chaotic. The Roman Emperor Caesar set the Julian calendar, and the calendar was put on track.
　　The difficulty in harmonizing the solar and lunar calendars lies in the inability to match the two cycles of the moon orbiting the earth and the earth orbiting the sun. The time required for the moon to orbit the earth is 29.53059 days, that is, twenty-nine days, twelve hours, forty-four minutes, and three seconds. The time required for the earth to orbit the sun is 365.242216 days, that is, three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and forty-six seconds. The two cycles cannot be divided by each other. The ancient Chinese lunar calendar harmonized the lunar and solar calendars quite successfully. A lunar month has thirty days, and a short month has twenty-nine days. A year of twelve months is only three hundred and fifty-four days, which is more than eleven days less than the solar year. A leap month is inserted every three years, but there are still a few days more. But if seven leap months are added to nineteen lunar years, they are almost equal to nineteen solar years. In the middle of the Spring and Autumn period in our country, we already knew the method of seven leap months in nineteen years, which was one hundred and sixty to seventy years earlier than the Greek Meton's invention of this cycle. The twenty-four solar terms are also a feature of the Chinese calendar. The solar terms completely follow the sun, and can be called a part of the solar calendar. The two solstices and two equinoxes were already known in the Spring and Autumn period. The remaining twenty solar terms were only completed between the Qin and Han Dynasties. In the West, there are only four solar terms: the vernal equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, and winter solstice. They do not have names like the Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, and Awakening of Insects like we do in China. These twenty-four solar terms are of great practical convenience to the general public. Gu Yanwu of the Ming Dynasty said in his Daily Knowledge Record: "Before the Three Dynasties, everyone knew astronomy. 'July flowing fire' is the saying of farmers. 'Three stars in the household' is the saying of women. 'The moon leaves Bi' is the work of soldiers. 'Dragon tail lies in Chen' is the ballad of children. Later generations of literati and scholars are at a loss when asked about it." Before the Spring and Autumn period, there were no twenty-four solar terms, so people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation were all determined by observing the appearance and disappearance of the stars, and astronomical knowledge was very common. After the Qin and Han Dynasties, with the solar terms and monthly ordinances, after popular rumors and ballads such as "sowing seeds at Qingming and transplanting seedlings at Guyu" and the Nine-Nine Songs became popular, the general public no longer needed to look up at the sky.
　　The ancient Chinese method of determining the four seasons of the year was initially based on the appearance and disappearance of stars at dusk. The Book of Documents, Yao Dian, uses the four constellations Bird, Fire, Void, and Pleiades as the central stars at dusk in mid-spring, mid-summer, mid-autumn, and mid-winter. The oracle bone inscriptions of the Yin Ruins already have the star names "Fire" and "Bird." Sima Qian's Historical Records says that in ancient times there was a Fire Official who specialized in observing the twilight appearance of the Great Fire. It can be seen that in our country three thousand years ago, the initial appearance of the Great Fire, namely the second star of the Heart constellation, at dusk in spring was a major agricultural event of the year, and the season was determined by the twilight appearance of the Great Fire. By the middle of the Spring and Autumn period, our calendar had made significant progress. According to the deduction of the Japanese scholar Shinjo Shinzo, this was because the earth-gauge was used to observe the shadow of the sun to determine the winter solstice and summer solstice in the era of Duke Wen and Duke Xuan of Lu, that is, the seventh century BC. The Greeks used the earth-gauge to measure the winter and summer solstices, starting with Anaximander in the sixth century BC, which was several decades later than our country. After the Spring and Autumn period, the Qin Dynasty used the Zhuanxu calendar, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty used the Taichu calendar, both with 365 and a quarter days as one year, which was the same as the Julian calendar promulgated by the Roman Emperor Caesar, but it was 200 to 60 years earlier than the Julian calendar.
　　In addition to calendrical science, our ancient reliable astronomical records were also ahead of those of other countries in the world. Not only were they the earliest in time, but they were also the most detailed. Taking solar eclipses as an example, even if we do not discuss the solar eclipses recorded on the oracle bones of the Yin Ruins, and the solar eclipses recorded in the Book of Documents, Yin Zheng, and the Book of Songs, Xiaoya, because the years cannot be determined, the Spring and Autumn Annals alone records 36 solar eclipses in 242 years. Among them, 32 have been proven to be reliable. The earliest was the solar eclipse on the first day of the second month of the third year of Duke Yin of Lu, that is, February 22, 720 BC. This is 135 years earlier than the earliest reliable record in the West, the solar eclipse recorded by the Greek Thales. Other astronomical records, such as the record of Halley's Comet, began in the seventh year of Emperor Qin Shihuang (240 BC), and the record of sunspots began in the first year of Emperor Cheng of Han, He Ping (28 BC), all of which were 1400 to 1500 years earlier than the same records in the West.
　　We have twenty-eight constellations, and India also has twenty-eight constellations. If we compare the Chinese twenty-eight constellations with the Indian twenty-eight constellations, we know that the Chinese twenty-eight constellations have the same distant stars as the Indian ones in the Horn, Di, Room, Wall, Lou, Stomach, Pleiades, Beak, and Zhen constellations. The distant stars are different but in the same constellation are the Room, Heart, Tail, Basket, Dipper, Danger, Bi, Can, Well, Ghost, and Willow constellations. The ones whose distant stars are different and belong to the same constellation are only the Kang, Cow, Woman, Void, Kui, Star, Zhang, and Wing constellations. Among them, India replaces our Woman constellation with Weaver Girl, and the River Drum, namely Cowherd, replaces our Cow constellation. From this, we can know that the two are from the same source. Whether these twenty-eight constellations originated in China or originated in India has been hotly debated by Westerners for more than a hundred years since the beginning of the 19th century, without a conclusion. But judging from the fact that the Chinese twenty-eight constellations are led by the Horn constellation, and the changes in the Cow and Woman constellations, the birthplace of the twenty-eight constellations is undoubtedly in China.

　　中国古代在天文学上的伟大贡献
    中国科学院副院长  竺可桢
    在世界各民族文化发达的过程中，天文学总是最早发达的一门科学。无论是农耕民族或是游牧民族，统要依照四季循环来安排他们的生活，决定他们的行动。浮海为生的民族，要在茫茫大海中知道方向，必须认识星宿和太阳的位置。人类的生活既逃不了空间和时间，所以凡是具有高度文化的民族，必须有丰富天文知识，古代天文学最发达的民族要算巴比伦，印度，希腊和中国。可是过去资本主义国家谈天文学史的人，多推崇巴比伦和希腊，蔑视中国在天文学上的伟大成就。一方面固由于西洋写天文史的人，不懂得中国文字。但自命为中国通的人，也鄙夷中国古代天文学的成就而不肯称道，如十九世纪中叶英国传教士谌约翰著《中国古代天文学史》把中国古来在天文学上的创造，统以为是传自印度和巴比伦，即是一个例子。也有少数学者如《星辰考源》的作者荷兰人薛莱格，误解了中国的经典，把中国天文学史推到一万六千年前，以为西方天文知识多源于中国，这也未免过于夸张。我们若用实事求是的眼光来研究世界科学发达史，中国古代在天文学上的成就，自有其辉煌卓越的贡献，值得我们的探讨和宣扬。
    中国古代天文学上的成就，有两点和巴比伦与希腊不同的。第一是注重实用，我们天文学上的成就，许多是为配合实际需要而得到的。在同一时期我们的理论也许不比希腊高明，但是技术的应用上我超过了他。第二我们有悠久的历史，各时代继续不绝的有记录，有发现有创造。我们若把中国天文学发达史分为三个时期，即（一）从殷周到两汉三国（二）从六朝到唐（三）从五代到元明，则每个时代统有杰出的人才，在继续不绝的劳动着，才能创造我们古代在天文学上伟大的贡献。
    在第一个时期，我们最大的贡献是在历学上。从殷墟时代起，我们已是农耕社会。一年四季寒来暑往的规律对于农产品的培养、生长和收获是有决定性作用的。必得把握这寒来暑往的规律才能把农产物搞好。稻麦五谷早种或迟种十天的差别，常会使农人一年辛苦的劳动变为成功或失败。过去受了帝国主义宣传的毒素，总以为阳历是从西洋传来的，西洋古代历法要比中国来得精密高明，这是完全错误的。我们从甲骨文上可以看出三千年前殷代已经有十三月的名称。书经尧典说：“綦三百有六旬有六日以闰月定四时成岁”。所谓三百有六旬有六日就是阳历年，以闰月定四时成岁乃阴阳历并用。西洋在巴比伦时代或希腊罗马时代，也夹用阴阳两历，和中国原是一样。不过同一时代我们的历法要比希腊罗马来得进步。孟子离娄章说：“天之高也，星辰之远也，苟求其故，千岁之日至可坐而致也”。古人称冬至夏至为日至。像孟子所说，在战国时代我们测定阳历年的长短，已极有把握。西洋到了我们西汉末年的时候，历法还是非常纷乱，罗马该撒皇帝定了儒略历，历法遂上了轨道。
    阳历和阴历调和的困难，在于月亮绕地球，和地球绕日两个周期的不能配合。月亮绕地球一周所需时间为二九·五三○五九天，就是二十九天十二小时四四分三秒。地球绕太阳一周所需时间为三六五·二四二二一六天，即三百六十五天五小时四八分四六秒。两个周期不能相互除尽。中国古代农历把阴阳二历调和得相当成功。阴历月大三十天，月小二十九天。一年十二个月只三百五十四天，要比阳历年少十一天有余。每隔三年插一个闰月，却尚多了几天。但若十九个阴历年加了七个闰月，和十九个阳历年几乎相等。我国在春秋中叶，已知道十九年七闰的方法，要比希腊人梅冬发明这个周期，在时间上早一百六七十年。二十四节气，也是中国历的特点。节气完全跟太阳走的，可称阳历的一部分。二至二分在春秋时候已经知道了。其余二十个节气到秦汉之间才完备。西洋到如今只有春分、夏至、秋分、冬至四个节气，并不像我们中国有立春、雨水、惊蛰等名称。这二十四节气于实用上，给一般老百姓以极大方便。明顾炎武日知录说：“三代以上人人皆知天文，七月流火，农夫之辞也。三星在户，妇人之语也。月离于毕，戍卒之作也。龙尾伏辰，儿童之谣也，后世文人学士有问之而茫然者矣。”春秋以前没有二十四节气，所以人们的衣食住行统要看星宿的出没来决定，天文常识就很普遍。秦汉以后，有了节气月令，像“清明下种，谷雨下秧”这类谣谚，和九九歌等流行以后，一般老百姓就无需仰观天文了。
    中国古代定一年四季的方法，最初以黄昏星宿的出没为主。尚书尧典以鸟、火、虚、昴四宿为仲春、仲夏、仲秋、仲冬黄昏时之中星。殷墟甲骨文中已有“火”和“鸟”的星名。司马迁史记称古代有火正，专门观测大火的昏见。可见我国三千年前，春季黄昏大火即心宿第二星的初见，为一年中农业上的大事，季节由大火的昏见而决定，到了春秋中叶我国历学有了显著的进步。依据日本人新城新藏氏的推断，这是由于在鲁文公宣公时代，即公历纪元前七世纪，已采用土圭来观测日影，以定冬至和夏至的缘故。希腊用土圭测定冬、夏至，始于纪元前六世纪的亚纳雪曼达，尚在我国之后数十年，春秋以后，秦用颛顼历，汉武帝时用太初历，统以三百六十五天又四分之一日为一岁，和罗马该撒皇所颁的儒略历同，但却比儒略历要早二百年到六十年。
    除历学而外，我国古代可靠的天象记录，也多在世界各国之先。不但时间最早而且也最详尽。如以日蚀而论，我国即使把殷墟甲骨上所记的日蚀，和书经胤征，诗经小雅所载的日蚀，因为年代不能确定不谈外，单春秋一书二百四十二年中，记有三十六个日蚀。其中有三十二个已证明是可靠的。最早的是鲁隐公三年二月朔的日蚀，即在公历纪元前七百二十年二月二十二号。比西方最早可靠的记录，即希腊人泰耳所记的日蚀要早到一百三十五年。其余天象记录如哈雷慧星的记载开始于秦始皇七年（公历纪元前二百四十年），日中黑斑的记录开始于汉成帝河平元年（公历纪元前二十八年），统要比西洋同样记录早到一千四五百年之多。
    我国有二十八宿，印度也有二十八宿。我们若把中国二十八宿和印度二十八宿相比较，知道中国二十八宿距星和印度相同者有角、氐、室、壁、娄、胃、昴、觜、轸、九宿。距星虽不同而同在一个星座者有房、心、尾、箕、斗、危、毕、参、井、鬼、柳、十一宿。其距星之不同属于一个星座者，只有亢、牛、女、虚、奎、星、张、翼八个宿。而其中印度却以织女代我们的女宿，河鼓即牛郎代我们的牛宿。从此可以知道二者是同出于一源的。这二十八宿究竟起源于中国还是起源于印度，从十九世纪初叶起，西洋人热烈的辩论了一百多年，不得结论。但从中国二十八宿以角宿为带头，和牛女两宿的变动看起来，二十八宿的发祥地，无疑是在中国。
