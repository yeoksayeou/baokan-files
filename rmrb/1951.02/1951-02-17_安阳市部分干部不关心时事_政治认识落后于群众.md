　　Some Cadres in Anyang City Do Not Care About Current Events
　  Political Understanding Lags Behind the Masses
    Since Anyang City launched the campaign to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, it has achieved considerable success. However, there are still shortcomings, the main one being that propaganda work is not consistent. Leaders like to engage in vigorous propaganda weeks but are not good at guiding regular, specific propaganda activities. Why is this the case? The main reason is that most cadres can only give grand reports but are not good at conducting propaganda to the masses anytime, anywhere. However, city-wide large-scale gatherings cannot be held every day, and many cadres do not do propaganda work in smaller settings. As a result, propaganda work has to cool down, and many cadres are invisibly outside the current affairs propaganda movement. There are also some comrades who not only do not engage in propaganda themselves but also prevent others from doing so. For example, during the women's representative meeting held in the city last December, the representatives accused American imperialism, which stimulated their patriotic enthusiasm. After returning, they actively carried out propaganda activities. Representatives from Anyang Bridge and Nanguan in the suburbs, after conveying the spirit and resolutions of the women's representative meeting and organizing accusation meetings, many women automatically donated pennants, comfort money, and comfort bags to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who were fighting bloody battles in Korea, and expressed their determination to produce and support them. This shows the political consciousness and irresistible strength of Chinese women who have been liberated. However, after District Head Yuan of the district learned about this, he not only did not encourage their patriotic enthusiasm but shouted, "Who told you to do this? The higher-ups didn't instruct you to do so. Send back whatever you've collected, however you collected it." This dampened the emotions of women and people from all walks of life in these two areas. Why would District Head Yuan do this? The main reason is that he does not actively study current events and cannot quickly accept new things and new ideas, thus lagging behind the masses. In this way, he naturally cannot go deep when carrying out current affairs propaganda work to resist America and aid Korea.

### 安阳市部分干部不关心时事  政治认识落后于群众

　　安阳市部分干部不关心时事
　  政治认识落后于群众
    安阳市自展开抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传工作以来，有了不少成绩，但其中还有缺点，主要的是宣传工作不经常。领导上欢喜搞轰轰烈烈的宣传周，而不善于指导经常的、具体的宣传活动。为啥会这样呢？主要原因是多数干部只会作大报告，而不善于随时随地向群众进行宣传。但是不能每天举行全市性的大规模集会，不少干部在小的场合又不做宣传工作，结果宣传工作就只好冷下来，这样无形中不少干部就处于时事宣传运动之外。还有些同志自己不宣传反而不让别人宣传，例如：去年十二月本市开妇女代表会议时，代表们对美帝国主义作了控诉，激发了她们的爱国热情，回去后就积极进行宣传活动。郊区安阳桥和南关的代表在传达了妇女代表会议的精神、决议和组织了控诉会后，不少妇女都自动捐献锦旗、慰劳金和慰问袋等，要送给在朝鲜浴血奋战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，并表示决心生产支援他们。这表示翻了身的中国妇女的政治觉悟和不可抗拒的力量。但这件事被该区袁区长知道后，不但不鼓励她们的爱国热情，反大嚷说：“谁叫你们搞的？上级又没指示你们这样做，你们怎样募捐的就怎样送回去。”这样便打击了该两地的妇女和各界群众的情绪。为什么袁区长会这样呢？主要是因为他不积极学习时事，不能较快地接受新的事物和新的思想，因此落后于群众。这样，他作起抗美援朝的时事宣传工作来自然深入不了。
