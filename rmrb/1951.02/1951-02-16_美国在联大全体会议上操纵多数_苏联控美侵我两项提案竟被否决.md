Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on February 13 to discuss the Soviet Union's accusations against the United States for aggression against China, and accusations against the United States for violating China's airspace, strafing and bombing Chinese territory, and shelling Chinese ships. As is known, on February 7, the majority of the General Assembly's Political Committee, under pressure from the United States, rejected the two Soviet proposals.

In addition to the Soviet proposals, the majority of the plenary session, disregarding the resolution already passed by the General Assembly last year to hold the Sixth Session in Europe, still included the issue of the location of the Sixth Session on the agenda. The Soviet Union and other countries expressed their opposition.

The plenary session then discussed the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States for aggression against China. Soviet representative Tsarapkin spoke. He pointed out that the deliberations of the Political Committee on the Soviet accusations showed that the United States was doing everything possible to prevent the Political Committee from discussing the Soviet proposals and passing just resolutions. The "sinister silence" of the majority of representatives in the Political Committee had clearly demonstrated this.

Tsarapkin said: The United States cannot refute the facts presented to the United Nations by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation. These facts prove that the US aggression against China was carefully prepared and ordered by the highest US military authorities. Tsarapkin pointed out the following prominent facts: First, Truman issued an order on June 27 to send the US Seventh Fleet to Taiwan; second, the United States interfered in China's internal affairs by directly intervening with armed forces and supplying weapons to the Kuomintang group; third, the US Air Force has violated Chinese airspace more than 1,500 times. Tsarapkin asked: What more is needed to prove US aggression against China?

Tsarapkin continued that the Assembly has no right to ignore these acts of aggression by the United States government. It is the duty of the Assembly to stop US aggression against China in order to enhance not only the security of China but also the security of the entire Asia. Therefore, the Soviet delegation insists on passing the two Soviet proposals. The Soviet delegation believes that the Assembly must discuss this issue very thoroughly.

After Tsarapkin finished speaking, Chairman Andien said that he asked the plenary session to indicate whether they wished to hold a debate on this issue. Thirty-nine delegations opposed the debate, five countries (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) were in favor, and eleven countries (Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Abyssinia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Yugoslavia) abstained.

Andien then announced that a vote would be held on the Soviet Union's first proposal regarding US aggression against China. The proposal was rejected by the usual mechanical majority. Five votes (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) were in favor of the proposal, forty-eight voted against, and three (Burma, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia) abstained.

The Polish representative explained his reasons for voting, saying that the facts speak more clearly than any language about US aggression against Taiwan. US armed forces are now stationed in Taiwan, hostile to the only legitimate government of China—the People's Republic of China—and in violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.

Czechoslovak representative Nosek said that he supported the Soviet proposals because these proposals were based on undeniable facts. He called for the implementation of the principles of the United Nations.

The Belarusian representative said that the facts of US aggression had been conclusively proven. If the United Nations General Assembly does not act as a tool of the United States, it must condemn the criminal acts of the US government.

Ukrainian representative Demchenko made a similar statement.

US representative Gross, disregarding the facts presented by the Soviet Union and other delegations, insisted that the accusations against the United States were "groundless."

The Indian representative said that the Indian delegation and eleven other delegations had recently made a proposal requesting that all parties concerned attend a meeting to discuss Far Eastern issues, including Taiwan. He continued that India believes that the Taiwan issue should be resolved on the basis of the Cairo and Potsdam decisions. Unfortunately, the twelve-nation proposal was not adopted. However, India still believes that negotiations are the best way to achieve a peaceful resolution, and mutual condemnation will not benefit a peaceful resolution. Therefore, the Indian delegation will not vote in favor of the Soviet proposal.

Chairman Andien then requested a vote on the Soviet Union's second proposal, which concerned US violation of Chinese airspace and bombing of Chinese territory. Five delegations (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, fifty-one voted against, and two (Afghanistan and Yugoslavia) abstained.

The General Assembly then began to discuss the issue of the location of the Sixth Session of the Assembly and the report submitted by the Secretary-General and the President of the Assembly on this issue. The report recommended that the Assembly reconsider the resolution on holding the Sixth Session in Europe and instead hold it in New York. The report said that the results of the study showed that it was difficult to hold the meeting in Europe, and the French government had rejected the proposal to hold the Sixth Session in Paris.

Tsarapkin said that the Soviet Union opposed changing the resolution. He pointed out that on December 14 last year, the Assembly had already decided that the Sixth Session would be held in Europe. The current attempt to reconsider this issue is the result of a conspiracy by a delegation that wants the Sixth Session to be held in New York in order to create the most favorable environment for that delegation. This motion has no place on the agenda.

After a brief discussion, the majority of the plenary session, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other countries, decided that the Assembly must meet before March 10 to discuss the location of the Sixth Session. The plenary session then adjourned.

　　美国在联大全体会议上操纵多数        
    苏联控美侵我两项提案竟被否决
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会二月十三日举行全体会议，讨论苏联所提出的控诉美国侵略中国案以及控诉美国侵犯中国领空、扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只案。如所周知，二月七日，大会政治委员会的多数在美国压力下否决了苏联的这两个提案。
    除苏联提案外，全体会议多数不顾大会去年即已通过第六届会议定在欧洲举行的决议，而仍将第六届会议地点问题列入议程。苏联等国表示反对。
    全体会议继即讨论苏联控诉美国侵略中国案。苏联代表查拉普金发言。他指出，政委会审议苏联控诉案的情形表明，美国尽一切力量来阻止政委会讨论苏联提案并通过公正的决议。政委会多数代表的“居心叵测的沉默”已经清楚地说明了这一点。
    查拉普金说：美国无法反驳苏联代表团团长维辛斯基向联合国组织提出的事实。这些事实证明美国对中国的侵略经过周密的准备，并且是命令美国最高军事当局来进行的。查拉普金指出下面这些突出的事实：第一、杜鲁门六月二十七日发布命令，派遣美国第七舰队到台湾；第二，美国以直接武装干涉和供应武器给国民党集团的办法，干预中国的内政；第三，美国空军侵犯中国领空，已经发生了一千五百多次。查拉普金问道：还需要什么来证明美国侵略中国呢？
    查拉普金继续说，大会没有权利无视美国政府的这些侵略行为。制止美国对中国的侵略，以便不仅增进中国的安全而且增进整个亚洲的安全，乃是大会的职责。因此，苏联代表团坚持通过苏联的两个提案。苏联代表团认为大会必需很彻底地来讨论这个问题。
    查拉普金发言完毕后，主席安迪让说：他要求全体会议表示他们愿否就此问题举行辩论。三十九个代表团反对辩论，五国（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克）赞成，十一国（阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、阿比西尼亚、印度、印尼、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、也门及南斯拉夫）弃权。
    安迪让于是宣布就苏联的第一个关于美国侵略中国的提案举行表决。这个提案被照例的机械多数所否决。五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克）赞成这个提案，四十八票反对，三票（缅甸、印尼、南斯拉夫）弃权。
    波兰代表解释他的投票理由说：事实比较任何语言都更清楚地说明着美国对台湾的侵略。美国的武装部队现在驻在台湾，敌视唯一合法的中国政府——中华人民共和国，而且违犯国际公法和联合国宪章。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克说：他支持苏联的提案，因为这些提案是无可争辩的事实为根据的。他要求执行联合国的原则。
    白俄罗斯代表说：美国侵略的事实已被确实地证明了。如果联合国大会不做美国的工具，它就必须谴责美国政府的犯罪行为。
    乌克兰代表杰姆琴科作了类似的发言。
    美国代表葛罗斯不顾苏联和其他国家代表团所提出的事实，硬说对于美国的控诉是“毫无根据的”。
    印度代表说，印度代表团和其他十一国代表团最近曾经提出建议，要求使有关各方一起出席讨论包括台湾在内的远东问题的会议。他继称，印度认为台湾问题应该以开罗和波茨坦的决定为基础来解决。不幸，十二国提案没有被通过。但是，印度仍然相信谈判是达到和平解决的最好方法，相互谴责对于和平解决不会有好处。因此，印度代表团将不投票赞成苏联的提案。
    主席安迪让随即要求对苏联的第二个提案举行表决，这个提案是关于美国侵犯中国领空和轰炸中国领土。五个代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克）投票赞成苏联的提案，五十一票反对，二票（阿富汗和南斯拉夫）弃权。
    全体大会然后开始讨论大会第六届会议的开会地点问题与秘书长和大会主席就这个问题所提出的报告。报告建议大会重新审议关于在欧洲举行第六届会议的决议，而改在纽约举行。报告说研究的结果，说明很难在欧洲举行会议，而且法国政府已经拒绝第六届会议在巴黎举行的建议。
    查拉普金说，苏联反对改变这个决议。他指出，在去年十二月十四日，大会已经决定第六届会议将在欧洲举行。现在要把这个问题予以重新审议的企图是某代表团的阴谋的结果，这个代表团希望第六届会议在纽约举行，以便造成对这个代表团最有利的环境。这个议案在议程上是没有地位的。
    经过短暂讨论后，全体会议多数不顾苏联等国的反对，决定大会必须在三月十日以前开会讨论第六届会议的地点问题。全体会议随即休会。
