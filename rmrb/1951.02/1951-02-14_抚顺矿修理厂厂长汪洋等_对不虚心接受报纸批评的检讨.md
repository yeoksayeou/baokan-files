To the Editor:

On September 16th of last year, your newspaper's "People's Forum" published a criticism by Lu Bo, a reporter from the Fushun Workers' Daily, regarding the serious bureaucracy existing in the leadership of our factory. Subsequently, on October 11th of last year, your newspaper published an explanation from our factory director, Wang Yang, regarding this criticism. We now have a new understanding and self-criticism regarding this event, and we hope to publish it in your newspaper to thank the millions of loyal readers across the country who care about the cause of our Party.

In the past, because we were immersed in the fog of routine事务主义 every day, our understanding of the Party's policies was too poor, our senses were dull to new things, and our vision was narrow, thus committing the serious error of not accepting criticism as we did last year. Since then, after a long period of help from the higher-level Party leadership organs, especially through the education of articles frequently published in your newspaper regarding the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, and recently with the direct help and guidance of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee, we have realized that: since last year, our leadership style in the enterprise and our attitude towards criticism in the Party newspaper have seriously violated the basic spirit of the Party Central Committee's decision to unfold criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications.

In making the 1950 production summary, we discovered many serious shortcomings, with leadership full of loopholes. Looking at the production figures, although the annual task was completed and exceeded, the financial cost plan was not completed, and the product quality also failed to meet the requirements. Due to insufficient mechanical maintenance and technical management, many accidents occurred. Due to insufficient education of workers, labor discipline was lax and attendance rates decreased. The relationship between the Party, the administration, and the trade union was not normal, and it failed to concentrate leadership to improve production. The enthusiasm and creativity of all factory employees and technicians were not well utilized. In the past, the factory's leading cadres did not recognize these shortcomings, were satisfied with the usual bits and pieces of "achievements", liked flattery, and were jealous of criticism. Therefore, last year, Director Wang Yang did not humbly accept and correct the shortcomings of the criticisms from the Party newspaper and the Fushun Workers' Daily reporter, but instead, using the excuses of "the criticism not completely conforming to the facts" and "the motives of the criticism being impure," vehemently rejected the criticism. He narrowly regarded the people's enterprise as the private property of a few leaders, and tightly sealed the door to the Party and the people's concern and supervision of the enterprise with a "no criticism" sign. This allowed the people's enterprise to be manipulated by a few stubbornly bureaucratic elements, causing irreparable losses to the Party and the people. This impure Party spirit and serious bureaucracy are extremely harmful to the cause of the Party and the people. At that time, the factory's Party committee also failed to stand on the Party's position and seriously implement the Party's decision to unfold criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications; instead, it coexisted peacefully with the administration, echoed its sentiments, and adopted the same attitude towards criticism from the Party newspaper as the administration. Now we deeply realize that: these ideological styles are contrary to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit indicated in the Party Central Committee's decision to unfold criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications. In addition to conducting this self-criticism here, we also guarantee to immediately and strictly correct this impure Party spirit and serious bureaucratic leadership style that is harmful to the cause of the Party and the people.

### 抚顺矿修理厂厂长汪洋等  对不虚心接受报纸批评的检讨

　　抚顺矿修理厂厂长汪洋等
　  对不虚心接受报纸批评的检讨
    编辑同志：
    去年九月十六日贵报《人民园地》发表了抚顺工人报记者鲁渤对本厂领导存在着严重官僚主义的批评。接着，去年十月十一日贵报又发表本厂厂长汪洋对这一批评的解释。现在我们对这一事件已有了新的认识和检讨，希望能在贵报刊登，以谢全国千万忠心耿耿关怀我们党的事业的读者。
    过去由于我们每天沉浸在事务主义的雾海里，对于党的政策领会太差，对新鲜事物感觉迟钝，视野狭小，因而犯了去年那样不接受批评的严重错误。此后经过上级党的领导机关长时间的帮助，特别经过贵报经常发表的有关展开批评与自我批评的文章的教育，最近又在抚顺市委直接帮助与教导下，我们觉悟到：去年以来我们对企业的领导作风与对党报批评的态度，是严重地违反了党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评决定的基本精神的。
    我们在作一九五○年生产总结中，发现很多严重的缺点，领导上漏洞百出。从生产数字上看，全年任务虽完成和超过了，但财务成本计划没有完成，产品质量也未能达到要求。由于对机械保养与技术管理作得不够，造成很多事故。由于对工人教育不够，致使劳动纪律松懈，出勤率降低。党政工关系不够正常，未能集中领导力量来搞好生产。全厂职工与技术人员的积极性和创造性未能很好的发挥出来。而厂内领导干部过去未认识到这些缺点，满足于平时一点一滴的“成就”，喜欢逢迎，疾忌批评。因而汪洋厂长去年对党报及抚顺工人报记者的批评，不是虚心接受，改正缺点，而是借口“批评不完全符合事实”和“批评的动机不纯”，铿铿其辞地拒绝批评。把人民的企业，狭隘地看作是少数领导者的私业；把党与人民群众对企业的关心与监督之门，紧紧地贴上“谢绝批评”的封条。这就使人民的企业操纵在执迷不悟的少数官僚主义分子的手里，使党与人民蒙受无可补偿的损失。这种党性不纯与严重的官僚主义，对党与人民事业的危害是非常可怕的。而当时工厂党委也未能站在党的立场，严肃地贯彻党关于在报纸刊物展开批评与自我批评的决定；反而跟行政一起，和平共居，随声附和，对党报的批评，采取和行政同一的态度。现在我们深深地认识到：这些思想作风，是和马列主义的原则和党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定中所指示的精神相违背的。我们除了在此进行检讨外，并保证立刻严格纠正这种有害于党和人民的事业的党性不纯和严重官僚主义的领导作风。
