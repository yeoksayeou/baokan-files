Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: On January 30, 1951, the majority of countries in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation and coercion of the United States government, rejected the proposal by twelve Asian and Arab countries to convene a seven-nation conference, as well as the Soviet amendment, and illegally passed the U.S. proposal slandering our country. Subsequently, on February 1st, the United Nations General Assembly followed suit and illegally passed the U.S. proposal. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement on this matter as follows:

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and important Asian issues. Not to mention the past, on January 17th of this year, our Central People's Government submitted four proposals to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly regarding such issues. Therefore, twelve Asian and Arab countries proposed convening a seven-nation conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East. Although the title and content of the proposal still needed some revisions, and the Soviet representative had also proposed amendments, the twelve-nation proposal itself did express a sincere desire for peace. The majority of countries in the United Nations, under the manipulation and coercion of the United States government, disregarding the efforts of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the representatives of most of the twelve countries including India and Egypt, as well as the wishes of peace-loving people around the world, rejected the twelve-nation proposal and the Soviet amendment in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on January 30th. They passed the U.S. proposal slandering our country as an aggressor against Korea, in order to further expand the U.S. war of aggression. Subsequently, on February 1st, they followed suit and passed the U.S. proposal in the United Nations General Assembly. This most blatantly proves to peace-loving people and countries around the world that the U.S. government and its accomplices want war, not peace, and have blocked the path to a peaceful resolution.

The United Nations General Assembly and its First Committee, without the participation of the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China and in violation of the authority of the Security Council, passed the U.S. proposal slandering our country, which is obviously illegal, defamatory, and invalid. The Chinese people firmly oppose it.

This U.S. proposal completely reverses right and wrong and confuses black and white. It is clear that the U.S. government created the Korean incident, interfered in and invaded Korea, and interfered in and invaded China's Taiwan. Yet, the U.S. proposal falsely claims that the Chinese Communist Party is interfering in Korea and that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is invading Korea. It is clear that peace-loving and democratic people around the world advocate sanctions against U.S. aggression and demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Korea and Taiwan. Yet, the U.S. proposal instead demands that measures be taken against the Chinese people's just action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and country, and demands that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army withdraw from Korea. It is clear that the U.S. government has repeatedly rejected various proposals from China and the Soviet Union regarding a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and ultimately even rejected the twelve-nation proposal to convene a seven-nation conference. Yet, the U.S. proposal falsely claims that the government of the People's Republic of China has not accepted the United Nations' various proposals for a ceasefire in Korea in order to seek a peaceful resolution. Indeed, we cannot accept the U.S. government's trick of "ceasefire first, negotiate later," and therefore proposed convening a seven-nation conference to negotiate a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, and all related issues. But when we further clarified that after the seven-nation conference opens, a limited-term ceasefire can be agreed upon first, and then all related issues can be negotiated, the U.S. government impatiently threatened and coerced the representatives of the majority of countries in the United Nations, and hastily rejected the proposal for a seven-nation conference. Is this not clear evidence that the U.S. government wants to expand the war and opposes peace? Therefore, it is clear that the U.S. aggressor troops want to continue to occupy Korea, continue to occupy Taiwan, and continue to launch large-scale offensives and massacres. Yet, the U.S. proposal falsely claims that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is continuing to invade Korea, and therefore calls on its accomplice countries to give it all assistance while giving China "no assistance whatsoever." The Chinese people have never expected "any assistance" from the U.S. accomplice countries; however, all the assistance that the U.S. accomplice countries have given to the U.S. has not saved it from its miserable defeat in Korea in the past, and will certainly not save it from its miserable defeat in the future. Conversely, the Chinese people will from now on more clearly recognize the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, will more firmly resolve to defeat the aggressors with action, and will better understand the need to take all necessary measures to cope with the U.S. imperialism and its accomplices' attempts to expand the war.

The Indian representative to the United Nations said correctly that the actions taken by the majority of countries in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the evening of January 30 "mean: no ceasefire, no negotiation, and no peaceful resolution." This is the purpose that the U.S. government threatened them to achieve, and it is the true meaning of the U.S. proposal. Specifically, the U.S. imperialists' aim is to: continue to occupy Korea and Taiwan, interfere in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, conduct a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, coordinate with its rearming of West Germany in the West, and drive the people of Asia, Europe, and the world into the abyss of war in order to fulfill its dream of dominating the world. It should be pointed out that the U.S. government's attempt to threaten the world is very fragile and cannot do as it pleases, and will be full of flaws, because it is a desperate step taken under the circumstances of the U.S. aggressor army's disastrous defeat in Korea, increasing domestic and foreign contradictions in the U.S., and the unprecedented strength of the world's peace and democracy forces. In the face of the rising strength of the resistance of the people of all of China, all of Asia, and all the world, it will inevitably encounter final failure and bankruptcy. The U.S. proposal has set up a so-called "good offices" mechanism, which reflects this situation and also attempts to paralyze some kind and naive peace-loving people. This illegal "good offices" mechanism is set up within the proposal that slanders our country, which is not only a blatant deception, but also an insult to the Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will absolutely ignore it.

The U.S. government has been manipulating and coercing the majority of countries in the United Nations to engage in activities that violate the United Nations Charter for a long time. At the beginning of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, U.S. President Truman first ordered the U.S. armed forces to invade Korea and China's Taiwan at noon on June 27, 1950, and then, on the same evening, manipulated the majority in the Security Council without the participation of the Soviet and People's Republic of China representatives, and illegally retroactively approved the U.S. armed forces' invasion of Korea, without mentioning Taiwan, which the U.S. attempted to occupy exclusively. Now, because the Soviet representative in the Security Council abides by the Charter and adheres to justice, the U.S. proposal to slander our country simply bypasses the Security Council in violation of the law and directly submits it to the United Nations General Assembly, in order to undermine the principle of unanimity of the great powers. Even so, the illegal passage of the U.S. proposal was extremely reluctant and was caused by the powerful pressure of the U.S. government's threats and inducements; in fact, the population of the countries that do not approve of the U.S. proposal exceeds more than half of the world's population, and the countries that approve of the twelve-nation proposal have the support of 1.4 billion people. It can be asserted that if the U.S. government cannot implement its policy of manipulating and coercing the majority in the United Nations, then the world's peace situation could have been established long ago. The Soviet representative said well in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly that all those who voted in favor of the U.S. proposal must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action. Therefore, striving to bury this shameful, aggressive, reactionary, imperialist U.S. proposal, which was illegally passed in form, and completely defeat it, will not only pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and important Asian issues, but also lay the foundation for opposing wars of aggression, safeguarding world peace, and restoring the dignity of the United Nations Charter.

　　中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长      
    关于联合国大会非法通过诬蔑我国的决议的声明
    【新华社二日讯】一九五一年一月三十日联合国大会第一委员会的多数国家在美国政府的操纵和劫持之下，拒绝了十二个亚洲和阿拉伯国家所提的召开七国会议的议案及苏联的修正案，非法通过了美国所提的诬蔑我国的议案。接着，二月一日联合国大会又如法炮制地非法通过了美国的提案。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长特就此事发表声明如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府是历来主张和平解决朝鲜问题及亚洲重要问题的。远者不论，今年一月十七日我中央人民政府曾就此类问题向联合国大会第一委员会提出四项建议。因此，亚洲和阿拉伯的十二个国家便提出了召开七国会议以和平解决朝鲜问题及远东其他问题的议案，虽然提案的标题和内容仍有若干需要修正，而且苏联代表亦已提出修正，但十二国提案本身确表示了真诚的和平愿望。联合国中的多数国家在美国政府的操纵和劫持之下，不顾苏联、波兰、捷克和十二国提案中印度、埃及等多数国家的代表的努力及世界爱好和平人民的愿望，竟于一月三十日在联合国大会第一委员会中拒绝了十二国的提案及苏联的修正案，并且通过了美国所提的诬蔑我国为对朝鲜的侵略者以便美国进一步扩大侵略战争的议案，接着，于二月一日又在联合国大会中如法炮制地通过了美国提案。这就向全世界爱好和平的人民和国家最露骨地证明：美国政府及其帮凶们是要战争不要和平的，而且堵塞了和平解决的途径。
    联合国大会及其第一委员会在没有中华人民共和国的合法代表参加、而且在侵越安全理事会的权限的情况之下，竟通过美国诬蔑我国的提案，显然是非法的，诽谤的，无效的，中国人民坚决表示反对。
    美国这一提案完全是颠倒是非，混淆黑白。明明是美国政府制造出朝鲜事件，干涉和侵略朝鲜，干涉和侵略中国的台湾，而美国提案却反说中国共产党在干涉朝鲜，中华人民共和国中央人民政府在侵略朝鲜。明明是全世界爱好和平民主的人民主张制裁美国侵略，要求美军撤出朝鲜和台湾，而美国提案却反而要求对中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动采取措施，反而要求中国人民志愿部队自朝鲜撤退。明明是美国政府无数次地拒绝中国和苏联关于和平调处朝鲜问题的各项建议，最后甚至拒绝了十二国关于召开七国会议的提案，而美国提案却反说中华人民共和国政府没有接受联合国关于停止朝鲜战争以求得和平解决的各项建议。诚然，我们不能接受美国政府先停战后谈判的诡计，故而提议召开七国会议，以谈判停战、撤兵及一切有关问题。但当着我们进一步说明七国会议开后可以先商定有限期的停战，然后再谈判一切有关问题的时候，美国政府便迫不及待地威胁和劫持联合国中多数国家的代表，慌忙地否决了关于七国会议的提案。这不是美国政府要扩大战争反对和平的明证么？因此，明明是美国侵略部队要继续侵占朝鲜，继续侵占台湾，继续大规模地进攻和屠杀，而美国提案却反说中国人民志愿部队在继续侵犯朝鲜，故号召其帮凶国家给它以一切援助而不给中国以什么“任何援助”。中国人民从来就没有指望过美国帮凶国家的“任何援助”；只是美国帮凶国家给予美国的一切援助过去不曾挽救它在朝鲜的悲惨失败而且将来也绝不能挽救它的悲惨失败。相反方面，中国人民从此倒会更清楚地认识美帝国主义的侵略野心，会更坚定自己以行动击败侵略者的决心，会更懂得为了对付美帝国主义及其帮凶们的扩大战争企图而采取一切必要的措施。
    在联合国的印度代表说的对，联合国大会第一委员会中多数国家在一月三十日晚间所采取的行动“意味着：不停火，不谈判，也不和平解决”，这就是美国政府威胁他们所要达成的目的，也就是美国提案的真意。具体说来，美国帝国主义的企图是：继续侵占朝鲜和台湾，干涉越南和东南亚，进行单独对日缔约和重新武装日本，配合它在西方重新武装西德，并将亚洲、欧洲及世界人民驱入战争深渊，以遂其独霸世界的迷梦。应该指出：美国政府这个威胁世界的企图是很脆弱的，并不能为所欲为，而且会破绽百出，因为它是在美国侵略军在朝鲜惨败、美国国内外矛盾增加、和世界和平民主力量空前强大的形势下所采取的一个挺而走险的步骤，在全中国全亚洲和全世界人民反抗的力量高涨前面，必将遭遇到最后的失败和破产。美国提案中设置了一个所谓“斡旋”机构，就是反映这种情况，同时也为着企图麻痹一些善良而又天真的爱好和平的人们。这种非法的“斡旋”机构是在诬蔑我国提案之内设置的，不仅是一种赤裸裸的欺骗，更是一种对于中国人民的侮辱，中华人民共和国中央人民政府绝对不予理睬。
    美国政府操纵和劫持联合国中的多数国家，进行违反联合国宪章活动，由来已久。在美国侵朝战争开始时，美国杜鲁门总统就于一九五○年六月二十七日正午先行命令美国武装力量侵略朝鲜和中国的台湾，然后才于同日晚间在没有苏联和中华人民共和国代表参加的安全理事会中操纵多数，非法地事后追认了美国武装力量侵略朝鲜的行动，而不提及美国企图独占的台湾。现在，因为安全理事会中有苏联代表遵守宪章，坚持正义，故美国诬蔑我国的提案便索性违法地越过安全理事会而直接提交联合国大会，以破坏大国一致的原则。即使如此，美国提案之被非法通过，也是极勉强的，是在美国政府威胁利诱的强大压力下造成的；实际上，不赞成美国提案的国家的人口超过世界人口半数以上，赞成十二国提案的国家有十四亿人民的支持。可以断言：联合国中如果美国政府不能行使其操纵和劫持多数的政策，则世界和平局面早就可以奠定了。苏联代表在联合国大会第一委员会中说的好：所有投票赞成美国提案的人，都要对这种行动的后果负严重的责任。因此，努力于葬送这一在形式上被非法通过的可耻的侵略的反动的帝国主义的美国提案，使之彻底归于失败，将不仅为和平解决朝鲜问题及亚洲重要问题开辟道路，而且为反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平及恢复联合国宪章的尊严奠定基础。
