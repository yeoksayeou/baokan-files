To the Editors:

The "Letters from Readers" column in your February 10th issue published reader Lan Ying's criticism of our bureau's "abuse of bonuses," which has been of great help to us. As pointed out in the editor's note, some of our cadres still suffer from a serious bureaucratic style of work. Although our work underwent a lengthy reorganization last year, it still lacks a spirit of careful study and adherence to principles, resulting in undue losses. First, regarding the application procedures for locomotive boiler cleaning bonuses, which should have been carefully reviewed and signed off on by the boiler cleaning foreman, thermal engineer, inspector, factory director, technical director, section chief, etc., at the grassroots level, only the section chief signed off on the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot's application for November bonuses, and the staff of the locomotive section did not investigate. Second, according to the Bureau's regulations, locomotive boiler cleaning bonus applications should be calculated based on the locomotive's major inspection method, but the depot applied for bonuses based on the heat transfer area, which did not comply with the boiler cleaning bonus regulations, and the locomotive section did not study and analyze it during the bonus review, but carelessly approved it. Furthermore, Ou Guocai, the staff member of the railway branch's locomotive section in charge of boiler cleaning bonuses, did not investigate and study the work he was in charge of; Zhang Zhongxian, the deputy section chief of the locomotive division, only asked when the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, based on its actual situation, did not intend to apply for boiler cleaning inspection bonuses in December, "How did you apply in November? Were there also problems with the bonuses you received in November?" and did not further investigate the matter. The above facts fully demonstrate the shortcomings and errors in the branch bureau's leadership work. Taking the lessons of this incident, we must strengthen the current ongoing rectification of the office, strengthen the ideological education of employees, strictly implement the inspection system, and use this to educate all railway employees, especially cadres at all levels, to wage a struggle against all forms of bureaucracy.

However, there are some discrepancies between reader Lan Ying's criticism and the facts, which are clarified as follows:

First, since the Bureau issued the boiler cleaning bonus regulations in September of last year, it has been difficult to meet the requirements of the bonus regulations in practice due to the excessive alkalinity of the water quality on the Beijing-Baotou Railway line, which easily forms hard scale. The branch bureau discovered this problem in mid-October last year and inquired with the Bureau's locomotive department by telephone. Later, the Bureau's locomotive department replied, "This issue has been decided to be raised at the National Locomotive Conference for research and resolution." The branch bureau also inquired by telephone with the Datong and Guihua locomotive depots about the details of boiler cleaning in mid-December. On January 14th, the Guihua locomotive depot replied in a letter stating, "Considering that other workers have bonuses, only the boiler cleaning workers do not, so we adopted a wider standard for review in November." Based on this situation, the branch bureau decided to temporarily not issue boiler cleaning bonuses for December and consulted with the Bureau's personnel department through the personnel section and proposed the following specific improvement suggestions: (1) The standard scale should not be calculated as a percentage of the total heat transfer area; (2) The inspection location and scope should be clearly specified; (3) The degree of residual hard and soft scale should be specified separately; (4) The inspection method should be clearly specified, and a unified inspection record should be used. This shows that we are gradually studying and improving this matter.

Second, the use of caustic soda for boiler cleaning was an idea conceived by the Guihua locomotive depot to remove water rust. The branch bureau learned about this matter in advance, and when Zhang Yunhan, the deputy section chief of the Bureau's locomotive section, came to the branch bureau in November of last year, we made an oral inquiry. He instructed, "Individual experiments can be conducted." Therefore, the branch bureau did not definitively prohibit the use of caustic soda for boiler cleaning.

### 天津铁路局张家口分局  关于滥发奖金的检讨

　　天津铁路局张家口分局
　  关于滥发奖金的检讨
    编辑同志：
    二月十日贵报《读者来信》栏刊登读者蓝英对我局“滥发奖金”的批评，对我们有很大帮助。正如编者按语中指出的，我们在工作中，有些干部还严重的存在着官僚主义作风。我们的工作虽经去年历时很久的整理，但仍缺乏认真钻研，坚持原则的精神，致使工作受到不应有的损失。首先，关于机车洗炉奖金的请领手续，本来应由基层单位的洗炉工长、热力技术员、检查员、工厂主任、技术主任、段长等逐级认真审核签章，但张家口机务段请领十一月份奖金时，只有段长签章，机务科经办人亦未追究，其次，按照管理局的规定，机车洗炉请奖，应以机车大检查的办法计算，但该段以传热面积计算请奖，不符洗炉奖励办法，而机务科核奖时，并没有研究分析，就马虎的核了出去。再次铁路分局机务科经办洗炉奖励人员欧国材，平时对自己掌管的工作，不调查研究；机车股副股长张仲贤，在十二月份当张家口机务段根据其实际情况，不拟请领锅炉洗检奖金时，只追问：“十一月份你们怎么请领的呢？十一月份领的奖也有问题吧？”而未进一步深入了解这个问题。以上事实，充分说明分局领导上工作中的缺点与错误。接受这一事件的教训，我们要加强目前正在进行的机关整顿工作，加强职工的思想教育，严格执行检查制度，并以此教育全路职工，尤其是各级干部使之向一切官僚主义展开斗争。
    但读者蓝英在对我们的批评中，也有些地方与事实还有出入，特说明如下：
    第一、自去年九月份管理局颁布了洗炉奖励办法后，由于京包线水质碱性太大，易结硬质水垢，在执行中很难达到奖励办法中的要求，分局于去年十月中旬便发现此问题，曾用电话向管理局机务处请示，后来管理局机务处答复说：“这问题，决定提到全国机务会议上去研究解决。”分局于十二月中旬并曾以电话询问大同、归绥机务段的洗炉详情，一月十四日归绥机务段来信答复称：“因鉴于其他工友都有奖励，独洗炉工友没有，故我们十一月份审核尺度较宽。”据此情况，分局决定十二月份洗炉奖金暂时不发，并由人事科与管理局人事处洽商提出了如下具体改进意见：（１）标准尺度不以占总传热面之百分数计算；（２）应明确指定检查部位及范围；（３）应分别规定硬软水垢余存程度；（４）应明确指定检查方法，统一使用检查纪录。这说明我们对这件事是在逐步研究改进中。
    第二、用火碱洗炉，是归绥机务段为了清水锈想出来的办法，分局事先即了解这个问题，去年十一月份管理局机务处机车科副科长张云汉到分局来时，我们曾作过口头请示。他指示：“可作个别试验。”因此分局也未肯定禁用火碱洗炉。            天津铁路管理局张家口分局
