　　Ma Hengchang Group Competition Movement Widely Launched
　  More Than 1,400 Units Actively Respond
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ma Hengchang Group competition movement continues to be widely carried out throughout the country. The number of units responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group has increased dramatically in recent days. According to statistics from reports received from various localities up to the 13th, there are already 56 factory and mining enterprises and 1,380 production groups in the country responding to the challenge. Among them, 812 are in North China, 292 in Northeast China, 161 in East China, 87 in Central and South China, 66 in Northwest China, and 18 in Southwest China.
    Workers in medium and small cities across the country have also begun to respond enthusiastically. Workers in Baoding, Xinji, and Zanhuang in Hebei; Yangquan in Shanxi; Jiaozuo, Jixian, and Bo'ai in Pingyuan; Yingkou, Liaoyang, and Chengde in Northeast China; Xuzhou, Yantai, Xin Hailian, Hefei, and Bengbu in East China; Zhengzhou, Zhumadian, Enshi, Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Guilin in Central and South China; Guiyang in Southwest China; and Caijiapo in Northwest China are all actively responding to the challenge. In addition to major industrial workers, shop assistants, forestry workers, medical staff, and others are also actively responding. As the national banner of production groups, the Ma Hengchang Group has completed its production five days ahead of schedule in the first month of the competition, with quality and attendance rates reaching 100%, and has also adhered to its work posts during the Spring Festival. This model action and experience of the Ma Hengchang Group has won praise from workers and leading comrades across the country. At the National Trade Union Production Work Conference in May and June 1950, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The production work experience of the Ma Hengchang Group should be promoted throughout the country." This promotion work is now gradually unfolding.
    One of the advanced experiences of the Ma Hengchang Production Group is that they have turned technical research into a regular system. They established a technical research association within the group to solve technical difficulties that may have occurred or have already occurred. They also used the methods of "checking the first piece of work" and "three-person technical mutual aid groups" to prevent defective products, ensure quality, and reduce costs, thereby also improving the technical level of the workers. Secondly, they established a production responsibility system and conscious labor discipline within the group. In their work, everyone is assigned responsibility, and production plans are formulated for the group and individuals; at the same time, the group mutually inspects and helps with handover systems, finished product inspections, and protection of machines, and frequently conducts criticism and self-criticism around production, achieving a collective responsibility system in which everyone is responsible for everything. Finally, they can unite and patiently help new workers with unlimited enthusiasm, train apprentices, and unite technical personnel, without the ideas of feudal guildism and technical conservatism. In this way, the Ma Hengchang Group frequently guarantees the superior quality of products and the overfulfillment of production tasks. In the past year, they have also improved 15 kinds of tools and created 25 new records, becoming the banner of production groups across the country and a model for adhering to regular production competitions.
    Since the emergence of the Ma Hengchang Production Group, workers in many places have enthusiastically learned from their advanced production experience and have achieved many results. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions at the end of last year alone, there were already more than 6,500 advanced production groups of the Ma Hengchang type in the entire region. Hundreds of such model production groups have also emerged within the customs. In September last year, one factory, Taiyuan Machine Factory, produced 15 Ma Hengchang-style model groups. Not only in the machinery industry sector, but also in the textile, electrical, and coal mining sectors, advanced production groups of the Ma Hengchang type have emerged. For example, the Sun Guilan Group of Tianjin State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2, the Liang Fengchang Group of Beijing Capital Power Plant, and the Ji Ronghua Group of Hebei State-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine. All these groups have created excellent production achievements in learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, setting an example for the broad masses of workers. Since learning the experiences of the Ma Hengchang Group, such as the three-person mutual aid group, checking the first piece of work, and holding technical learning meetings, the Liu Lifu Group of the Lushun-Dalian Shipyard Railway Factory has improved its technology and exceeded its task by an average of 43% per month last year, and has not produced any defective products, winning the glorious title of "Inspection-Exempt Group." After learning the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, the Zhang Fengquan Group of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory formulated ten labor covenants for the entire group, united and helped each other, and improved the tool for the "bearing bush," increasing the output from 20 to 180 and preventing defective products. The Repair Room Group of Tianjin Waterworks Company learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group and has completed its production tasks ahead of schedule every month for nine months. Compared with April last year, the average monthly output has increased by one and a half times, the stop rate has dropped from 10% to 0.8%, and the production cost has been reduced by 7%. And won the title of model group in the city. Yunnan Central Machine Factory learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group in the production competition, which significantly improved production efficiency. For example, taking the factory's output in May last year as 100, it rose to 272 in September, and even increased to 318 in October. To manufacture an eight-foot lathe in Manufacturing Department One, it took 360 workers before liberation, and now it only takes more than 260 workers to make it. Factories and mines in other places have also strongly promoted production by learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group.
    Now, workers in various places are enthusiastically learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group in responding to the challenge. After responding to the challenge, the Nie Yinchang Group of the Capital Telephone Bureau immediately conducted a comprehensive inspection of the machines, established a system of holding technical learning meetings three times a week and recording the operating status of the machines every hour, so the machine efficiency has approached 100%; they repaired a broken telephone by themselves in three hours, realizing the challenge conditions of ensuring smooth telecommunications and ensuring that the number of normal operating keys is not less than 97.7%. The Post Office's Li Shouxin Group, Jinsheng Group, etc., actively learned the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, established various systems, strengthened learning and unity, and changed labor organization, etc. In addition, some groups have paid attention to the lives and health of workers in proposing the conditions for responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. The Piston Group of the East China Artillery Company Manufacturing and Distribution Factory held a mutual aid fund to help solve the difficulties in the lives of comrades, so that all the workers in the group could work with peace of mind. The conditions for responding to the challenge of the first group of the cutting field of the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory also proposed "pay attention to hygiene, do not eat cold food, do not drink raw water, wear masks, go to bed early, and get up early."

　　马恒昌小组竞赛运动广泛开展
　  一千四百余单位积极应战
    【本报讯】马恒昌小组竞赛运动继续在全国各地广泛开展。向马恒昌小组应战的单位近日以来飞跃增加。据截至十三日止所收到的各地报道统计，全国已有五十六个厂矿企业单位和一千三百八十个生产小组应战。其中华北地区八百一十二个，东北二百九十二个，华东一百六十一个，中南八十七个，西北六十六个，西南十八个。
    各地中、小城市职工亦开始热烈应战。河北的保定、辛集、赞皇，山西的阳泉，平原的焦作、汲县、博爱，东北的营口、辽阳、承德，华东的徐州、烟台、新海连、合肥、蚌埠，中南的郑州、驻马店、恩施、湘潭、衡阳、桂林，西南的贵阳，西北的蔡家坡等地职工均积极应战。除各大产业工人外，店员、林业工人、医务工作人员等亦积极应战。作为全国生产小组旗帜的马恒昌小组，更在竞赛的第一个月中提前五天完成了生产，质量和出勤率都达到了百分之百，春节中也坚守了工作岗位。马恒昌小组的这种模范行动和经验，曾获得了全国工人和领导同志的赞誉。一九五○年五、六月间全国工会生产工作会议上，中华全国总工会李立三副主席曾说：“马恒昌小组的生产工作经验，应该向全国各地推广。”这种推广工作，现在已经逐步展开了。
    马恒昌生产小组的先进经验之一，就是他们把研究技术变成了经常的制度。他们在小组内成立了技术研究会，解决了技术上可能和已经发生的困难。并用“检查头一个活”和“三人技术互助小组”的办法，防止了废品，保证了质量，减低了成本，从而也提高了工友们的技术水平。其次，是他们在组内建立了生产责任制和自觉的劳动纪律。在工作中大家分工负责，制订出小组和个人的生产计划；同时对交接班制、成品检查、保护机器等，小组中都互相检查和帮助，并经常地围绕着生产展开批评与自我批评，做到了事事有人负责和人人负责的集体责任制。最后，是他们能以无限的热忱团结和耐心地帮助新工友，培养学徒，团结技术人员，没有封建行会主义的思想和技术保守观念。就是这样，马恒昌小组经常地保证了产品质量的优越和超额完成生产任务。在过去一年中他们又改进了十五种工具，创造了二十五件新纪录，成为全国生产小组中的旗帜和坚持经常生产竞赛的模范。
    自从马恒昌生产小组出现后，许多地方的工人都热烈地学习了他们的先进生产经验，并获得了不少成绩。仅据东北总工会在去年底的不完全统计，全区已有了六千五百多个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。关内也同样地出现了数百个这样的模范生产小组。太原机器厂一个厂在去年九月就产生了十五个马恒昌式的模范小组。不仅是在机器工业部门，而且在纺织、电业、煤矿等部门中，也都涌现出了马恒昌式的先进生产小组。例如天津国棉二厂的孙桂兰小组、北京首都发电厂的梁凤昌小组、河北国营峰峰煤矿季荣华小组等。所有这些小组在学习马恒昌小组的经验中，都创造了优异的生产成绩，给广大工人群众作出了榜样。旅大船坞铁路工厂刘立富小组，自从学习了马恒昌小组的三人互助组、检查头一个活、开技术学习会等经验后，提高了技术，去年平均每月都超过任务百分之四十三，还没出过废品，荣获“免检小组”的光荣称号。华北农业机械厂张凤泉小组学习了马恒昌小组经验后，全组订出了十条劳动公约，团结互助，改进了车“轴承瓦”的工具，使产量由二十个提高到了一百八十个，并防止了废品。天津市自来水公司修表房小组学习了马恒昌小组经验，九个月来每个月都提前完成生产任务，与去年四月相比，平均每月产量增加一倍半，停表率由百分之十降至百分之○点八，生产成本减低百分之七。并获得了全市模范小组的称号。云南中央机器厂在生产竞赛中学习了马恒昌小组经验，使生产效率显著提高。如以该厂去年五月产量为一百，九月份上升为二百七十二，十月份更提高到三百一十八。制造一部八尺车床，解放前需要三百六十个工，现在只需二百六十多个工，即可制成。其他各地厂矿在学习马恒昌小组的经验中，也都有力地推动了生产。
    现在各地职工在应战中都在热烈学习马恒昌小组的经验。首都电话局聂荫昌小组在应战后立刻做了机器的全面大检查，建立了每星期开三次技术学习会和记录每小时机器运转情况的检查制度等，因而机器效率已接近百分之百；电话机坏了自己用三个钟头就修好了，实现了保证电信畅通、保证正常运转机键数不低于百分之九十七·七的应战条件。邮局李守信组、金声小组等均积极学习马恒昌小组先进生产经验，建立各种制度、加强学习和团结、改变劳动组织等。此外，一些小组在提出向马恒昌小组应战的条件中，并注意到工友们的生活和健康问题。华东炮司制配厂活塞小组举办了互助基金，帮助解决了生活有困难的同志，因而全组工友都能安心生产。秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂生产课切场第一组的应战条件中也提出了“注意卫生、不吃冷食、不喝生水、带口罩、早睡觉、早起床”等条件。
