　　Smooth National Railway Transport Last Year
　  Promoted Unprecedentedly Active Material Exchange
    [Xinhua News Agency] The smooth national railway transport made the material exchange between urban and rural areas across the country unprecedentedly active last year. The supply of coal, grain, cotton, cloth and other necessities of people's livelihood was unprecedentedly good last year, which was not easy to achieve in the situation of vast territory, large population, especially the war just ended less than a year ago. Last year, the transportation volume of coal accounted for 58 percent of the total railway transportation volume. As a result of planned transportation, not only the needs of industrial cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Qingdao were guaranteed, but also new rural markets after land reform began to open up. According to the survey, in the rural areas around Baoding, Hebei, which mainly burned firewood in the past, more than half of the households now use coal. The transportation of tens of thousands of wagons of grain fully supplied the needs of cities and grain-deficient areas. The stable grain prices throughout the country last year are inseparable from this unprecedented large-scale transfer work. Through railway transportation, cotton from Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces has been supplied to the cotton textile industries in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Wuhan and other places in large quantities, which has also stimulated the production of cotton in the cotton-producing areas of the above-mentioned provinces. The salt production in coastal areas such as Tanggu, Qingdao, and Lianyungang has also restored its vast market in the interior due to the smooth railway transportation.
    Railway transportation has especially facilitated the large-scale sales of local products from the vast rural areas. This phenomenon of making the rural economy active is unseen for many years. For example, reed mats, one of the famous local products of Hubei Province, were transported to Northeast and Northwest by railway in nearly 1,000 wagons in 1950. In addition to the large-scale transportation of other local products such as almonds, medicinal materials, peppercorns, pears, and jujubes, the lives of many mountain farmers who used to live on "half a year of bran and vegetables and half a year of grain" have gradually improved. Last year, farmers in the mountainous areas of Jianping and Jingxing in Hebei, where crops suffered from disasters, were able to exchange one catty of dried persimmons for twelve taels of rice, thanks to the brisk sales of mountain products such as dried persimmons, which solved the problem of insufficient grain. The main by-products of the rural areas of Cangxian, Qingxian, and Xianxian counties in Hebei, such as pears and jujubes, were successively sold well in Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, totaling 110 wagons, which solved the problem of food and clothing needs of local farmers for about half a year.
    The transportation of many industrial raw materials in the inland areas has provided a basis for the recovery and development of urban industries. In addition to the huge amount of cotton transfer, tung oil from Sichuan and Hunan provinces, lacquer from Hubei, tobacco leaves from Xuchang area in Henan and Guizhou provinces, hemp skin and straw braid from Hebei and other provinces were also transported to Northeast and major cities in Guannei in large quantities by railway. After industrial raw materials such as sulfur and natural alkali produced in rural areas in Jin, Sui, Cha, Pingyuan and Ikezhao League were transported to Tianjin, the situation that Tianjin factories relied on American sulfur powder and American caustic soda before liberation has completely changed. Along with the large-scale sales of agricultural products from various places, thousands of wagons of agricultural production materials such as soybean cake, farm tools, cotton gin, as well as kerosene, cloth and general merchandise were transported back to the countryside from the cities last year through railways.
    The effect of railway transportation in regulating material supply and stabilizing prices is extremely significant. Taking Zhengzhou Railway Station, the intersection of Longhai and Jinghan railways, as an example, when the prices of salt in Xinyang, Luoyang, Shanzhou and other cities soared in June last year, the station accepted the entrustment of Zhengzhou Industrial Company and transported more than 4,000 tons of edible salt, which quickly reduced the salt prices in the above-mentioned areas. From September to October, the station also transported a large amount of grain, curbing the rising grain prices caused by grain shortage in western Henan.

　　去年全国铁路运输顺畅
　  促使物资交流空前活跃
    【新华社讯】全国铁路运输的顺畅，使去年全国各地城乡物资交流空前地活跃起来。全国煤、粮、棉、布等人民生活必需品的供应情况去年空前良好，这是在地区辽阔人口众多特别是战争刚刚结束不到一年的情况下所不容易达到的成就。去年煤的运输量占铁路运输总量百分之五十八。按计划运输的结果，不但保证了上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、青岛等工业城市的需要，而且开始打开了经过土地改革的新的农村市场。据调查，过去主要烧柴禾的河北保定一带的农村，用煤户现在已达半数以上。上万个车皮的粮食载运，充分地供应了城市和缺粮区的需要。全国各地粮价全年保持平稳和这种空前规模的大调运工作是密切不可分的。经过铁路运输，河北、河南、陕西、山西等省棉花大量供应了上海、天津、青岛、武汉等地的棉纺织工业，同时也刺激了上述各省产棉区棉花的生产。沿海塘沽、青岛、连云港等地区的盐产，也由于铁路交通的顺畅恢复了内地的广大市场。
    铁路运输特别使广大农村土产有了大量向外销售的便利。这种使农村经济趋于活跃的现象，是很多年来所看不到的。例如湖北省著名土产品之一的苇席，一九五○年经铁路运往东北、西北的将近一千车皮。加上其他土产如杏仁、药材、花椒、梨、枣等的大量向外运销，许多“半年糠菜半年粮”的山区农民生活已逐渐好转。去年农作物遭受灾害的河北建屏、井陉一带山区的农民，因所产柿饼等山货畅销，结果能以一斤柿饼换到十二两米，解决了粮食不足的困难。河北沧县、青县、献县三县农村主要副产物如梨枣等先后畅销津、京、沪地区共一百一十车皮，解决了当地农民约半年的吃穿需用。
    内地许多工业原料的运输，使城市工业的恢复和发展有了依托。除了巨量的棉花调运外，川、湘两省的桐油，湖北的漆和河南许昌地区、贵州省的烟叶，河北等省的麻皮、草帽辫等，也经由铁路大量运到东北和关内各大城市。在晋、绥、察、平原和伊克昭盟等地农村出产的工业原料如硫磺、天然碱等运往天津后，津市各工厂解放前依赖美国硫磺粉和美国火碱的情况已完全改变了。与各地农产品的大量向外销售同时，去年经过铁路又有数千辆车皮的农业生产资料豆饼、农具、压花机以及煤油、布匹与百货日用品由城市运回了农村。
    在调剂物资供应稳定物价方面，铁路运输的效用是极显著的。以陇海、京汉交叉点的郑州车站为例，当去年六月间信阳、洛阳、陕州等城市盐价暴涨时、该站接受了郑州实业公司的委托，运出四千多吨食盐，使上述各地盐价迅速回降。九十月间该站又运出了大批粮食，抑制了豫西地区因缺粮而引起的粮价涨风。
