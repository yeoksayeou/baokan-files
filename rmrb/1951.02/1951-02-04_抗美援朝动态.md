Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics

　　Central South Region Decides to Actively Promote the Patriotic Movement Among Workers and Farmers
　　The leading organs of the Central South Region have noticed the shortcomings in the development of the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea among workers and farmers, and have decided to concentrate efforts to overcome them.
　　Since the joint declaration of the democratic parties, three months ago, publicity about the current situation regarding resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has spread throughout major and medium cities, as well as some small cities and villages, in the Central South Region. 65,000 young people in the region have signed up to join military cadre schools (including 3,500 workers). Some factories and enterprises have launched patriotic production competitions. Where the current situation publicity is carried out well, such as at the Hubei Reclamation Office and some factories in Jiangmen City, Guangzhou, the competitions are very lively. The provinces have also done some work among farmers. Henan Province has even proposed a policy of combining land reform with current situation publicity. The Xuchang and Xinyang special districts have made significant achievements. Business circles in major and medium cities and some small city market towns have held patriotic parades and formulated patriotic pacts. Women's circles, religious circles, and medical circles in some major cities have also held patriotic demonstrations. Medical workers in major cities have formed surgical teams to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and have gone to work in Korea.
　　The main weakness of the movement is its uneven development. Many small cities, market towns, and most rural areas have not yet carried out this movement, and there is sometimes a disconnect between land reform/rent reduction and current situation publicity. In major and medium cities, the students' patriotic movement is developing well, but the workers' movement is lagging behind. There has been no systematic publicity for the general unorganized urban residents. Therefore, the leading organs of the Central South Region have decided to concentrate efforts in the cities to carry out the workers' patriotic movement in factories and mines, and vigorously promote this movement to develop towards small and medium cities and the vast rural areas. The plan is to popularize the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in all cities and the vast countryside in the first half of this year.

　　Good Experiences in Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in East China Region
　　The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in the East China Region, since the joint declaration of the democratic parties, reached a climax by the time of the liberation of Pyongyang in early December. Not only workers, students, and farmers were involved in the movement, but also business circles, church schools, and religious groups. The movement has been carried out more deeply in Shanghai, Nanjing, Southern Jiangsu, and some cities in Shandong.
　　The patriotic movement in East China has created some good experiences: (1) People who have suffered persecution, insult, or harm from U.S. imperialists accuse U.S. imperialists of their crimes, or from accusing the U.S. running dog Chiang Kai-shek or the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, connect to hatred of U.S. imperialism. This is very effective in raising mass awareness. The people of Shanghai have exposed more than 1,360 facts of U.S. imperialist crimes, which has greatly educated people from all walks of life. In Nanjing's anti-slander and anti-insult movement, 1,800 Christians, one-third of the city's total, also participated. (2) People from all walks of life and all industries gather to discuss and seriously formulate patriotic pacts. This is an effective way to popularize the movement and consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm and understanding of the masses. (3) Parades and demonstrations can stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and are also important for business circles, middle school teachers, and medical circles, who do not often participate in political activities. (4) Holding people's representative conferences on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, absorbing representatives from advanced, intermediate, and relatively backward strata in all walks of life, can effectively mobilize the masses universally. (5) Adopt various forms of publicity and mobilization suitable for different targets, such as inviting people who have returned from the United States to talk about the reaction, corruption, and weakness of U.S. imperialism, and inviting people who have returned from Eastern Europe to talk about the strength of the forces of peace and democracy and the improvement of China's international status; hanging maps of the Korean War situation everywhere and explaining the victories of the Chinese and Korean people's forces in a timely manner; singing快板( a form of rhythmic storytelling) and explaining blackboard newspapers in rural areas, publicizing during market days, and using shadow plays, picture dramas, and slides for publicity (farmers in Southern Jiangsu welcome slides very much, calling them "earth movies"), etc. These publicity methods are all effective.
　　Like other regions, the patriotic movement in East China also has weaknesses of being insufficiently widespread and deep. Some people who have been deeply influenced by U.S. imperialist propaganda still have many ideological problems, even if they have participated in parades and signed patriotic pacts. The patriotic movement has not yet been well developed in many small towns and the vast rural areas. Therefore, the leading organs of the East China Region have decided to use the existing good experiences to start this movement in places where it has not yet started, and to deepen it in places where it has already started, especially paying attention to establishing a regular publicity team while carrying out the movement.

　　Guangzhou People's Patriotic Movement is Being Consolidated
　　The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in Guangzhou, the largest city in South China, is now moving into a stage of deepening and consolidation after being widely launched.
　　After Premier Zhou Enlai published his article "Striving to Consolidate and Develop the People's Victory" on October 1st last year, the people of Guangzhou enthusiastically launched current affairs study and publicity activities. A total of 300,000 people participated, including about 100,000 workers, students, and cadres who listened to the current affairs report by Mayor Ye Jianying. After publicity and deliberation in November, a climax of accusing U.S. imperialist crimes of aggression and holding patriotic demonstrations and parades was launched in December. More than 300 accusation meetings were held by people from all walks of life, including 40,000 teachers and students from universities and middle schools, 25,000 residents from various districts, more than 20,000 people from business circles, women, returned overseas Chinese, primary school teachers, and religious circles, and nearly 10,000 workers, totaling 100,000 people. More than 120,000 people from all walks of life participated in the grand parade celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang, and more than 30,000 people from business circles and more than 15,000 people from church schools and organizations held patriotic demonstrations separately. More than 30,000 students and teachers from 103 schools, together with literary and art circles, went to factories, streets, and suburbs to carry out publicity. In the movement, new and old literary and art workers worked together to print and distribute 81 kinds of works for publicity, more than 270,000 copies, among which songs such as "Down with the American Devils" and "U.S. Imperialism, I'm Not Afraid of You" and scripts such as "Jeans" (note: jeans are Western rogue clothing) were very popular among the people. The number of people who can sing the song "Down with the American Devils" has reached 100,000. Patriotic drama performances were watched by 237,500 people. 13,000 young workers and students signed up to join military cadre schools. Since New Year's Day this year, the people of the city have continued to launch patriotic activities to celebrate the victory on the Korean front, send off young people joining military cadre schools, and raise donations to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.
　　In the movement, pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideas and national inferiority complexes have been greatly hit. In Lingnan University and other church schools, jeans (in the past, Lingnan University alone had more than 1,000 pairs) have disappeared, and arguments such as "it's better to be an American beggar than a Chinese college student" have been criticized. Students from church schools who usually don't care about politics and are more influenced by the United States have also been involved in the movement. Business circles have also realized that the new China "can fight and can talk." The problem now is to deepen and persist in the patriotic movement, to turn the slogans that people from all walks of life have put forward and the conventions that have been formulated into practice, and to strengthen the current relatively weak publicity work among workers, suburban farmers, and the general unorganized urban residents. The Guangzhou branch of this association will soon hold an enlarged meeting including representatives from all walks of life to summarize the experience of this period and arrange future work.

　　Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in Inner Mongolia
　　The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea patriotic movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is now developing. In the past period, current affairs political publicity in Inner Mongolia was done relatively widely and deeply. Each banner and county has cultivated 100 to 300 temporary propagandists through current affairs study or short-term training courses, and there are more than 4,000 propagandists in the region; leagues and above have established a system in which responsible persons make regular current affairs reports. Since the beginning of November last year, various places have successively launched Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country Movement Publicity Week. Subsequently, county and banner branches of this association were established one after another. At the same time, a representative conference of folk artists was held to promote them to carry out current affairs publicity work. By mid-November last year, this work had developed from cities to rural areas. Through people's representative conferences, cadre conferences, Communist Party of China representative conferences, and various training courses, combined with grain requisition, organizing winter schools, and sideline production, the political education work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea was gradually carried out in rural areas and pastures.
　　Many people in Inner Mongolia have not seen American imperialists, but they have common interests, that is, they oppose the United States supporting landlords and bandits to "change the sky," they love the happy life after the current land reform, and they oppose the American bandits, like the Japanese invaders, re-pressing on their heads. Therefore, they enthusiastically participate in the patriotic movement.
　　The leading organs of Inner Mongolia recently summarized the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea work in the previous period, and decided to vigorously launch current affairs publicity during the Spring Festival, regarding the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement as the driving force for all work in the current historical period, taking the in-depth conduct of this movement as a regular political task, and vigorously popularizing this movement to remote rural areas, nomadic areas, and mountainous areas.

　　Pingyuan Province Takes Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea as an Important Part of Winter Work
　　Some counties in Pingyuan Province have launched current affairs publicity on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in rural areas through district and village cadre conferences, autumn grain requisition conferences, model worker conferences, department store conferences, and people's representative conferences. A few places have also conducted education in connection with the current central work in rural areas, which has been very effective. However, the movement is currently limited to some areas and some people, and is still scattered and weak. The reasons are: (1) Lack of a trained publicity team that is regularly led; (2) Failure to seriously launch a mass accusation movement from bottom to top; (3) This movement is not closely integrated with the immediate interests of the masses and current work; (4) Leading organs have not conducted regular and effective leadership and inspection.
　　After reviewing the shortcomings of the current movement, the leading organs of Pingyuan Province have decided to strengthen this work, especially to closely integrate the movement with the struggle against rumors, the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, and the entire winter work, regarding the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement as an important link in successfully carrying out winter work.

专栏：抗美援朝动态

　　抗美援朝动态
    中南区决定积极推进工人农民中的爱国运动
    中南区领导机关已注意到抗美援朝的爱国运动在工人和农民群众中开展不够的缺点，决定集中力量加以克服。
    各民主党派联合宣言发表后三个月以来，抗美援朝的时事宣传已遍及中南全区各大中城市及部分小城市和乡村。全区青年报名参加军干校的有六万五千人（内工人三千五百人）。部分工厂、企业展开了爱国生产竞赛，时事宣传进行得好的，例如湖北农垦处、广州江门市的若干工厂，竞赛即大有生气。各省在农民中也做了一些工作，河南省还提出使土地改革和时事宣传互相结合的方针，其中许昌、信阳两个专区已做出显著成绩。各大中城市和部分小城市集镇工商界都举行了爱国游行，并订立爱国公约。部分大中城市的妇女界和宗教界、医药界也举行了爱国示威。各大城市的医务工作者已组成抗美援朝手术大队，并已赴朝工作。
    运动的主要弱点是发展不平衡，很多小城市集镇和大多数农村还没有进行这一运动，土改减租与时事宣传时有脱节现象。在大中城市，学生的爱国运动开展得较好，工人的较差，对一般无组织市民还没有系统的宣传。因此，中南区领导机关已决定：在城市中集中力量开展工厂矿山中的工人爱国运动，并大力推动这一运动，使它向中小城市和广大农村发展，计划在今年上半年内使抗美援朝运动普及所有城市及广大乡村。
            华东区抗美援朝的好经验
    华东区的抗美援朝运动，自各民主党派联合宣言发表后，至十二月初平壤解放，即形成高潮。不仅工人、学生、农民卷入运动，而且工商界、教会学校、宗教界团体也卷入运动。上海、南京、苏南及山东的一部分城市，运动进行得比较深入。
    华东区的爱国运动，创造了一些好的经验：（一）由身受美帝国主义者迫害、侮辱或损害的人控诉美帝国主义的罪恶，或者是从控诉美国的走狗蒋匪或日寇的暴行，联系到仇恨美帝国主义。这对于提高群众觉悟，收效很大。上海人民曾揭发了美帝国主义罪行一千三百六十多件事实，使各界人民受到很大教育。南京的反诽谤、反侮辱运动，全市三分之一的基督教徒一千八百余人也参加了。（二）各界和各行各业的人民集会讨论和认真订立爱国公约。这是使运动普及并使群众的爱国热情和认识巩固起来的有效方法。（三）游行示威，可以激发群众的爱国情绪，对于不常参加政治活动的工商界、大中学教员及医药界等也有重要作用。（四）举行各界人民抗美援朝代表会议，吸收各界人民中的先进的中间的和比较落后的阶层的代表人物参加，可以有效地普遍发动群众。（五）采取各种适合不同对象的各种各样的方式进行宣传鼓动，例如邀请从美国回来的人讲美帝国主义的反动、腐朽和脆弱，请从东欧回来的人讲和平民主力量的强大和新中国国际地位的提高；到处悬挂朝鲜战争形势图，及时讲解中朝人民部队的胜利；在农村中一边唱快板，一边讲解黑板报，趁集市时宣传，用影子戏、画片剧、幻灯进行宣传（苏南的农民很欢迎幻灯，称为土电影）等等。这些宣传方式都是行之有效的。
    华东区的爱国运动也和其他地区同样，还存在着不够普及和深入的弱点。有些受美帝国主义宣传影响较深的人们，即使参加了游行和订了爱国公约，思想问题还是很多。许多小城镇和广大农村，爱国运动还没有很好展开。因此华东区领导机关已决定运用已有的好经验，使这个运动在没有开展的地方开展起来，已经开展起来的地方深入下去，尤其是注意在运动开展的同时建立经常的宣传队伍。
            广州人民的爱国运动正在巩固起来
    华南最大城市广州人民的抗美援朝运动，在广泛展开之后，现正转入深入和巩固的阶段。
    去年十月一日周恩来总理发表了《为巩固和发展人民的胜利而奋斗》的论文之后，广州人民即热烈展开时事学习和宣传活动。参加的人数共达三十万人，其中约十万工人、学生和干部听了叶剑英兼市长的时事报告。经过十一月份的宣传和酝酿之后，十二月份即展开控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行和举行爱国示威游行的高潮。各界人民的控诉会举行了三百多次，参加的包括大中学师生四万，各区居民二万五千，工商界、妇女、归国华侨、小学教师及宗教界共二万多，工人近万，合计达十万人。各界人民十二万余人参加了庆祝解放平壤大游行，另有工商界三万余人，教会学校及团体一万五千余人分别举行爱国示威。一百零三间学校的三万多学生、教师，和文艺界一起，到工厂、街头和郊区宣传。在运动中，新旧文艺工作者通力合作，印发用以宣传的作品八十一种，二十七万份以上，其中“打倒美国鬼”、“美帝，我不怕你”等歌曲、“牛仔裤”（按牛仔裤系美国西部流氓服装）等剧本，甚得人民欢迎。会唱《打倒美国鬼》歌曲的人数已达十万。爱国戏剧演出，观众达二十三万七千五百人。报名参加军干校的青年工人、学生达一万三千人。自今年元旦起，全市人民继续为庆祝朝鲜前线胜利，欢送参加军干校青年，募捐慰问我国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军而展开爱国活动。
    在运动中，亲美、崇美、恐美思想和民族自卑心理已受到很大打击。在岭南大学及其他教会学校，牛仔裤（过去仅岭大就有一千多条）已绝迹，所谓“做美国乞丐也胜过当中国大学生”等论调已受到批判。平素不过问政治及受美国影响较多的教会学校学生也已卷入运动。工商界也认识到新中国“打得讲得”。今后的问题是使爱国运动深入和坚持下去，把各界人民已提出的口号、已制订的公约等变为实际，并加强目前比较薄弱的对工人、郊区农民和一般无组织市民的宣传工作。本会广州分会即将召开包括各界代表的扩大会议，总结这一时期经验，并布置今后的工作。
            抗美援朝运动在内蒙古
    内蒙古自治区的抗美援朝爱国运动，现正发展中。在过去一个时期，内蒙区的时事政治宣传做得比较广泛深入。各旗、县经过时事学习或短期训练班，都培养了一百至三百名临时宣传员，全区已有宣传员四千多人；盟以上都建立了负责人定期作时事报告的制度。去年十一月初起各地先后展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动宣传周。随后本会各县、旗分会相继成立。同时召开了民间艺人代表会议，推动他们进行时事宣传工作。至去年十一月中旬，这一工作即由城市向农村发展，经过人民代表会议、干部会议及中国共产党的代表会议及各种训练班，结合征粮、组织冬学及副业生产等工作，将抗美援朝的政治教育工作逐步在农村及牧场中展开。
    内蒙人民许多人没有看见过美国帝国主义者，但是他们有着共同的利益，这就是他们反对美国扶植地主、土匪来“变天”，他们热爱现在土地改革后的幸福生活，他们反对象日寇一样的美寇重新压在他们的头上。因此，他们热烈地参加爱国运动。
    内蒙区领导机关最近总结了前一时期的抗美援朝工作，决定利用春节大力展开时事宣传，把抗美援朝运动看作是当前历史时期一切工作的动力，把深入进行这个运动作为经常性的政治任务，并大力普及这一运动到僻远的农村、游牧区和山林区去。
            平原省以抗美援朝作为冬季工作的重要环节
    平原省若干县份已通过区村干部会、秋征会、劳模会、百货会、人民代表会等会议，在农村中展开了抗美援朝的时事宣传，少数地方并连系当前农村中心工作进行教育，很有成效。但运动目前还限于部分地区和部分群众，还分散无力。原因是：（一）缺乏一支有训练的并经常加以领导的宣传队伍；（二）没有认真开展自下而上的群众控诉运动；（三）这一运动未与群众切身利益及当前工作紧密结合；（四）领导机关没有进行经常的有效的领导和检查。
    平原省领导机关在检讨了目前这一运动的缺点后，已决定加强这个工作，特别是使运动与反谣言斗争、镇压反革命活动及整个冬季工作紧密结合，把抗美援朝运动看作是胜利地开展冬季工作的重要一环。
