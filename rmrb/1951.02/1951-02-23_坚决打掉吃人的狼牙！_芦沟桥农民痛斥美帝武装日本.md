　　Resolutely Smash the Man-Eating Wolf Fangs!
    — Lugou Bridge Farmers Denounce U.S. Imperialism for Arming Japan
　　Jin Feng
    Fourteen years ago, the Japanese invaders' cannons destroyed the tower of the ancient city of Wanping County and damaged the beautiful stone lions on the Lugou Bridge. From then on, this man-eating wolf broke into all of China. Six years ago, it was beaten half to death by the Chinese people and driven out of the mainland. The Chinese people had just managed to repair the beautiful stone lions on the Lugou Bridge when news came that U.S. imperialism was arming Japan. "Resolutely smash the man-eating wolf fangs!" This is the warning from the farmers of Lugou Bridge against this vicious conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists!

    In the town government, Guo Fengshan, an old farmer who is a people's representative of Lugou Bridge Town and also a production committee member of the farmers' association, looked down laboriously at the newspaper with photos of armed Japanese "police." The chairman of the farmers' association explained to him, "American imperialism is equipping the Japanese again to try to invade us. Look, aren't those Japanese soldiers with guns drilling?" As soon as the old man heard the word "drilling," he straightened his back and asked directly, "Drilling? The Japanese devils are drilling again? Who is letting them drill? We can't allow them to drill! That year, didn't they also say they were drilling, drilling, and on the first day of the sixth month (that is, 'July 7th') they窜(cuan - darted out) over, and eight years of disaster began? This time, humph, if they want to come again, we'll break their arms if they reach out, and they'll never return!" The chairman of the farmers' association emphasized, "This time, it's not just the Japanese wolf, there's also the American foreign devil sharpening its fangs behind it!" "Then we'll smash the wolf fangs, and also break the arm that's sharpening the wolf fangs!" Old man Guo Fengshan said very decisively.

    Old man Guo Fengshan is definitely not a man of empty words. He is over sixty years old this year and has lived in Lugou Bridge all his life. He knows the rise and fall of Lugou Bridge over the past sixty years as clearly as he knows the lines on his own hand. He personally saw the Lugou Bridge being bombarded by the Japanese invaders' cannons, with shells falling directly on the Yongding River, splashing water ten feet high. The beautiful and magnificent ancient bridge stood firm under the artillery fire. Guo Fengshan watched it intently, fearing that it would collapse in the sound of the shells, almost forgetting the fire in the houses around him. When the Japanese devils entered the street, Guo Fengshan, hiding in the sweet potato cellar, heard the sound of heavy leather boots stepping on the large stone slabs, as if stepping directly on his heart. He heard gunshots and dog barks; he heard the dry howls of men and the cries of women; he heard the collapse of houses and the sound of wood cracking... In the dark night, Guo Fengshan quietly crawled out and learned that Wu the tanner, Old Meng the pig butcher, Liu Zheng the grain store clerk, and Jia Fu the oil mill clerk had all been brutally killed by Japanese swords. Many women who could not escape were violated. The daughter-in-law of the Liu family in the second street was raped by those beasts in front of her father-in-law, which made the old man faint with anger, and he died not long after. The shops were all looted, and one street in the third street was burned, leaving only half of it. Guo Fengshan walked sadly through the rubble, with the cries of women echoing in his ears, and looking at the southern sky reddened by the fire, he pondered in his heart: "Lugou Bridge is finished this time!" Little did he know that a disaster was just beginning!

    As a result of the Japanese invaders' implementation of five public security enhancement movements in North China, thousands of people starved to death in Lugou Bridge. The common people ate a mixed flour like chaff, while the Japanese devils' foreign horses ate plump sorghum grains. People went to Fengtai to pick up horse manure, washed it and ate it; those who couldn't pick up horse manure and couldn't earn mixed flour had to wait to starve to death. Dozens of families who fled to Zhangjiakou died outside the pass; some gritted their teeth and entered the "refugee camps" run by the Japanese devils, which was equivalent to entering a death row. Every day, every day, Fan the cripple, who had a lame leg, dragged out four or five corpses from the camp. The camp was right in the current town government, with two or three hundred people crammed into thirteen rooms. Green-headed flies and lice crawled on people in piles. People who came in could not go out alive (because they were afraid of spreading disease), and the camp became a slaughterhouse. The bayonets of the sentries on both sides of the Lugou Bridge shone brightly, and people were not allowed to pass over the bridge. The bodies of people who had committed suicide by jumping into the river floated under the bridge.

    The source of Guo Fengshan's strength in speaking lies here. Because he deeply knows that every Chinese will never allow the U.S. imperialists to rearm Japan and hurt them again; today's China is different from the China of fourteen years ago, and today's people of Lugou Bridge are also different from the people of Lugou Bridge of fourteen years ago. He said: "First, we have Chairman Mao, second, we have the People's Liberation Army, and third, our common people have turned over and become masters." These are the guarantees of victory. If six years ago, this wolf was beaten half to death and went back with its tail between its legs; then today, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people who have stood up are fully confident in smashing this man-eating wolf's fangs and cutting off the "arm that sharpens the wolf fangs"!

　　坚决打掉吃人的狼牙！
    —芦沟桥农民痛斥美帝武装日本
　　金凤
    十四年以前，日本侵略者的大炮轰毁了宛平县古城的城楼，打坏了芦沟桥上美丽的石狮子；从此开始，这只吃人的野狼闯进全中国来。六年以前，它被中国人民打得半死，从大陆上被赶了出去。中国人民刚来得及修补芦沟桥上美丽的石狮子，又传来了美帝武装日本的消息。“坚决打掉吃人的狼牙！”这是芦沟桥农民对于美帝这一毒辣阴谋的警告！
    在镇公所，芦沟桥镇人民代表也是农会生产委员的郭凤山老汉，低头吃力地看着那登载着武装了的日本“警察”照片的报纸。农会主席在一旁给他解释：“美国帝国主义又在装备日本人想来侵略咱们。您瞧，这不是正在操练的背了枪的日本兵？”老头子一听得“操练”两字，顿然挺直了腰杆，直问：“操练，日本鬼子又在操练？是谁让它操练的？咱们可不能允许它操练！那一年，不也是说操练、操练，六月初一（就是‘七七’）窜过来，八年灾难就开了头？这一次，哼，它还想来，咱叫它伸出手来就断臂膊，有去无回！”农会主席着重地说：“这回不光是日本野狼，还有美国洋鬼子在后面磨狼牙呢！”“那咱就打掉狼牙，还要打掉那磨狼牙的臂膊！”老头子郭凤山说得很干脆。
    老头子郭凤山决不是说空话的人。他今年六十多岁了，一辈子土生土长在芦沟桥。六十来年芦沟桥的兴衰变迁，他像知道自己的手纹那样清楚。他亲眼看到芦沟桥被日本侵略者的大炮轰击着，炮弹直落在永定河面上飞溅起丈高的水花，美丽雄伟的古桥在炮火下屹然不动，郭凤山眼睁睁望着它，深怕它在炮弹声中崩溃下去，几乎忘了身边房屋的起火。日本鬼子进街来了，躲在白薯窖里的郭凤山，听到大皮靴一声声地踏在大石板上，仿佛直踏在他的心上。他听到枪声和狗叫；听到男人的干号和妇女的哭叫；听到房屋的倒塌和木材爆裂的声音……黑夜，郭凤山悄悄地爬出来，知道本街吴皮匠，宰猪的老孟，粮食店伙计刘正和油坊伙计贾夫，都活生生地被东洋马刀劈死了。逃不及的女人，被糟蹋的不少。二街刘家媳妇被那些禽兽当着她公公的面强奸，活活把那老头子气昏，不久就死了。店铺全给抢光了，三街一条街被烧得只剩下半条。郭凤山悲苦地在瓦砾堆中走着，耳边一片女人的哭声，望着南面烧红了的半边天，心中盘算着：“芦沟桥这一下可完了！”那里知道一场灾难还只是刚刚开头呢！
    日本侵略者在华北实行五次治安强化运动的结果，芦沟桥饿死的人上了千。老百姓家家吃的是糠渣似的混合面，日本鬼子的洋马却吃着粒粒滚圆的高粱米。人们上丰台拾马粪回来洗洗吃；拾不上马粪、挣不上混合面的只好等着饿死。逃荒到张家口的几十家死在口外；有的咬一咬牙进了日本鬼子办的“难民收容所”，这就等于进了死牢。每天、每天，跛了一条腿的范拐子从收容所拖出四、五具尸体。收容所就在现在的镇公所里，十三间屋子里挤满了二三百人。绿头苍蝇和虱蚤一堆堆地爬在人身上。进来的人不能活着出去（说是怕闹传染），收容所活活成了杀人场。芦沟桥两旁岗哨的刺刀闪亮，桥上不许人来往。桥下漂浮着跳河自尽的人的尸体。
    郭凤山说话的力量的源泉也就在这里。因为他深深知道：每一个中国人决不允许美帝重新武装日本，再来伤害他们；今天的中国，已经不同于十四年前的中国，今天的芦沟桥人民，也不同于十四年前的芦沟桥的人民。他说：“第一咱们有毛主席，第二咱们有解放军，第三咱们老百姓都翻身当了主人。”这些就是胜利的保证。如果六年以前，这只野狼被打得半死，夹了尾巴回去；那末，今天在毛泽东领导下，站起来的中国人民，是完全有把握打掉这吃人的狼牙，砍断那“磨狼牙的臂膊”的！
