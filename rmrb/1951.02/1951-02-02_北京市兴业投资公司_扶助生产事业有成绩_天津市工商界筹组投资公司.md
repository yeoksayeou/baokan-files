Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Beijing Xingye Investment Company has made considerable achievements in supporting production endeavors beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood since its official opening in September of last year. As of now, in addition to the Beijing Knitting Dyeing and Finishing Company, jointly established with the Beijing knitting industry to improve product quality and standardize specifications, the enterprises that have received investment from the company include the China Scientific Enterprise Company, Synthetic Chemical Industry Company, and Lihua Brewing Industry Company. These invested units have made considerable progress in their operations. The most significant among them is the China Scientific Enterprise Company. This company produces scientific instruments and medicines and has a relatively sound foundation. Before receiving the investment, due to business development, there was a need to increase equipment and output, but due to difficulties in capital turnover, the person in charge often had to run around, affecting the company's normal production. After receiving the investment, the funds were sufficient, and the person in charge could concentrate on improving business and researching technology. Xingye Investment Company also put forward some constructive opinions on the company's business, labor relations, and other aspects, so the business showed rapid development. The company's second factory producing glass instruments has built a new factory building, and after the boiler equipment is completed, it is estimated that the output will increase by at least 50 percent. The company is also preparing to further expand production and develop its business.

Due to the investment company's long-term fixed capital investment in some enterprises, the short-term working capital of the financial industry has also found more reliable outlets. For example, after receiving investment, the China Scientific Enterprise Company borrowed 240 million yuan from the Beijing United Lending Syndicate for purchasing goods. Lihua Brewing Industry Company urgently needed working capital in the spring and summer of last year, but because the business had not yet started, it could not obtain a loan. After Xingye Investment Company's investment, banks and financial institutions took the initiative to contact the company and provide loans.

[This newspaper] Tianjin: Li Zhuchen, Zi Yaohua, and others from the Tianjin business community recently initiated the organization of an investment company. To promote this work, the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee invited the initiators to hold a forum on January 26. After discussion, it was determined that the investment company's task is to support the development of industry and commerce throughout the city and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The amount of funds is set at 100 billion yuan, to be raised in four phases. The first phase will collect one-quarter of the funds before commencing business. The preparatory committee of the company was established on January 30 and is currently carrying out preparatory work.

    扶助生产事业有成绩       
    天津市工商界筹组投资公司
    【新华社三十一日讯】北京市兴业投资公司自去年九月正式开幕以来，在扶助有利于国计民生的生产事业上已做出相当成绩。截至目前止，接受该公司投资的企业，除了为提高产品质量划一规格与京市针织业共同建立的北京针织染整公司以外，还有中华科学企业公司、合成化学工业公司、利华酿造工业公司等单位。这些接受投资的单位，业务都有了相当的进展。其中最显著的是中华科学企业公司。该公司生产科学仪器、药品，基础比较健全。在接受投资前，由于业务发展，需要增加设备和产量，但因资金周转困难，负责人经常到处奔走，影响到公司正常的生产。在接受投资后，资金充足，负责人可将精力集中在改进业务和研究技术上；兴业投资公司又在业务、劳资关系等方面对该公司提出若干建设性的意见，因而业务即呈现突飞猛进状态。该公司生产玻璃仪器的第二厂已新建厂房一座，锅炉装置完成后，估计产量至少可增加百分之五十。公司方面并准备进一步扩大生产，开展业务。
    由于投资公司对某些企业作长期固定资金的投放，金融业的短期流动资金也找到了更多的可靠的出路。如接受投资后的中华科学企业公司，因为进货便向北京市联合放款银团贷了两亿四千万元。利华酿造工业公司在去年春夏间急需周转资金，但因当时业务没有开展，贷不到款，经过兴业投资公司投资后，银钱业就主动与该公司联系，给予贷款。
    【本报讯】津市工商界李烛尘、资耀华等，最近发起组织投资公司。津市财经委员会为推动这一工作，于一月二十六日邀请发起人举行座谈。经研讨后，确定投资公司的任务是扶助全市工商业发展，和促进城乡物资交流；资金额定为一千亿元，分四期募集；第一期先收进四分之一即开始营业。该公司筹备委员会已于一月三十日成立，现正进行筹备工作。
