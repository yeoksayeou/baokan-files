  I. "I Want to Shout: The People's Liberation Army Has Educated the People of Xinjiang."
    The large-scale production movement carried out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang in 1950 has great significance. It not only solved the problem of grain supply for the troops in various regions, saved huge grain transportation expenses, and improved the lives of the troops, but more importantly, it influenced and promoted the economic life of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    First, under the influence of the PLA's diligent production, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang began to change their views on labor. The traditional parasitic ideas of the old society, which regarded labor as shameful rather than honorable, began to disappear. In cities such as Dihua and Yining, large numbers of government cadres and people from all walks of life, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, devoted themselves to the labor of building the Urumqi River embankment and excavating and repairing the Huangqu Canal; in the countryside, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people has been aroused, setting off a upsurge in land reclamation and canal construction.

    Second, it broke with the traditional and backward farming methods of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Traditionally, it was believed that the climate in northern Xinjiang was too cold to grow cotton. However, the People's Liberation Army has successfully cultivated cotton using Soviet cotton seeds in Shawan, Jinghua, and other areas. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 60 jin, and some reached 100 jin. This shows that not only can cotton be grown in northern Xinjiang, but it can also be harvested well. Traditionally, it was believed that tea trees could not be planted in Xinjiang, so the brick tea that the people of Xinjiang needed every day had to be transported from Hunan. However, the tea trees planted by the People's Liberation Army in Korla and other places are growing very well, indicating that it is possible to plant tea trees in southern Xinjiang. In this way, if cotton in northern Xinjiang and tea in southern Xinjiang can be promoted and widely planted, it will have great significance for the economic life of the people of Xinjiang.

    The traditional farming method of the people of Xinjiang is to sow seeds and wait for harvest, without weeding or fertilizing. Although a lot of land is planted, the yield per mu is low. The People's Liberation Army brought more advanced farming methods, with good rice yields reaching more than 1,000 jin per mu, which made the people in various places believe that careful cultivation would lead to good harvests. They gradually learned to collect manure for fertilizer, and to weed and thin seedlings. The traditional habit of the people of Xinjiang in planting rice is to sow seeds, and to sow them thickly. The People's Liberation Army experimented with transplanting and spot seeding in several areas, and the rice grew well and the yield was high, and it also saved water compared to sowing. The large-scale promotion of transplanting and spot seeding can not only increase the yield of rice, but also increase the area of cultivated land due to water saving.

    Therefore, at the Xinjiang Production Exhibition held in Dihua in October last year, Di Yakov, a 70-year-old Russian teacher, excitedly wrote in the opinion book after seeing the various photos and charts of the People's Liberation Army participating in production and construction: "I want to shout, the People's Liberation Army has educated the people of Xinjiang."

  II. Fighting the Wind, Snow, Gobi, Hunger and Cold!

    Last year's crops were bountiful, and troops in various regions built new warehouses to store the grain they harvested. When loads of grain were transported into the new warehouses, the commanders and fighters remembered the days when they first arrived in the production area and fought against wind, snow, the Gobi Desert, hunger, and cold.

    In March last year, the People's Liberation Army stationed far below the Pamir Plateau began to march on foot from Turpan, crossing 3,600 li of the Gobi Desert to reach their station. There was no habitation there, so they set up tents; if there were not enough tents to sleep in, they slept in the open air; at that time, ice and snow still sealed the earth, and it was difficult to make a fire because of the strong wind, so they could not eat, and without oil or vegetables, they relied on eating salted water with rice.

    Under such circumstances, they began a large-scale production movement, using their own hands to improve their lives. Initially, the difficult situation was unimaginable. When the guard company of a certain regiment stationed in Yining went to the mountains to reclaim wasteland, they only ate one meal a day, and could not even drink a sip of water, so they persevered in their labor with a blade of wet grass in their mouths. The troops engaged in production on the banks of the Manas River, because of the difficulty of grain transportation, sometimes ate whole wheat grains that could not be ground into flour, and sometimes could not even eat whole wheat grains. Without vegetables, the troops dug up wild vegetables to eat. The troops overcame all kinds of difficulties with a spirit of hard struggle. Without production tools, they made them themselves; without animal power, they used human power to pull the plow; without seeds, the troops changed to eating coarse grains, saving wheat as seeds. Many units endured the bites of swarms of mosquitoes, covered their faces, and persisted in reclaiming grasslands where grass roots and red willow roots were as dense as spider webs.

    After a year of hard work, their labor has yielded beautiful results, and the desolate Xinjiang has begun to change its original appearance. On the Pamir Plateau, in Yining, on the banks of the Manas River, and in other places, places where there was originally no human habitation now have houses built. What was originally a desolate wilderness is now planted with crops and grazed by herds of cattle and sheep. New canals have been dug, wasteland has been reclaimed, new farms have been established, and new sounds are rippling in the fields—the happy songs and laughter of the troops while they are working.

  III. Revolutionary Heroism

    Over the past year, the commanders and fighters have thrown themselves into the production front with the spirit of revolutionary heroism, without hindering their military tasks. The female comrades and cooks took turns, carrying water, delivering meals, chopping firewood, and also helping to pick grass roots and spot seeds in the fields; the cooks also chopped firewood and grew vegetables. The families of the troops were also organized to participate in production. All personnel of the troops engaged in production were caught up in the upsurge of labor production. Many commanders and fighters had blisters on their hands but still insisted on reclaiming wasteland, unwilling to rest; sometimes when the canals breached, the commanders and fighters immediately braved the bone-chilling cold and jumped into the water to block the breaches with their bodies to repair them. These fully demonstrated the noble qualities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    A revolutionary heroic production competition and mass commendation and encouragement were widely launched in the troops. The propaganda and mobilization methods created by the political workers were diverse. There were wearing red flowers, marking red, blue, and black dots on the roster, recording merit books, raising and lowering charts, activity wall newspapers, broadcasting, group competitions between classes and platoons, red flag movements, pickaxe movements (awarding model units or individuals with standard pickaxes), material rewards, family visits, and so on. These political works encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters. Just as countless combat heroes emerged in the battles, a large number of labor models and model workers also emerged on the labor production front. According to statistics from a certain unit alone, three model companies, six model platoons, five model squads, and 692 labor models and model workers were produced throughout the division in the past year; and the combat heroes who had been tested in years of war became labor models once they turned to the production front.

    A particularly clear example is Chen Caide, a combat hero of a certain army who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives. He took an active lead in production. When the irrigation ditch was washed out by more than one zhang when watering cotton fields, he was the first to jump into the water and blocked the breach in waist-deep water all night. He personally reclaimed 28.4 mu of wasteland; another example is Guo Yangsen, a combat hero who had bayoneted more than 1,600 times in succession. In production, he first formulated a production plan for the entire squad, leading the entire squad to complete the plan of reclaiming 17 mu of wasteland per person, and he himself completed 20 mu; Chen Quankui, a combat hero who had been credited eleven times in three years, reclaimed 1.95 mu of wasteland on the first day of production, which was the highest record in the entire regiment, and later reclaimed 3 mu every day. The platoon led by Chen Quankui reclaimed an average of more than 2 mu of wasteland per person.

  IV. Great Victory on the Labor Production Front

    One year of labor has yielded great harvests. Troops throughout Xinjiang have reclaimed more than 830,000 mu of land, plus more than 100,000 mu of winter wheat planted last year, for a total of one million mu of reclaimed land. Among them, more than 170,000 mu of land suffered losses due to water, drought, and insect disasters, and there was no harvest or very little harvest, but the others were all harvested abundantly. According to statistics, a total of about 70 million jin of coarse and fine grains, more than 5.9 million jin of special crops (cotton, hemp, etc.), more than 7.37 million jin of oil and feed, and more than 45.24 million jin of melons, fruits, and vegetables were harvested.

    Some units have achieved even greater results. A certain regiment reclaimed more than 53,000 mu of wasteland, and the harvest can supply the regiment for one and a half to two years of food; in addition to agricultural production, a certain regiment also built national engineering buildings, which can supply all the regiment's expenses for the whole year except for clothing. If calculated by company, one company of one battalion of a certain regiment can be self-sufficient for five years; three companies can be self-sufficient for 35 months, and Comrade Song Xianyin, a combat hero of the company, personally reclaimed 85 mu of land throughout the year, and the harvest can supply one person for ten years of food, and the harvest of Song Xianyin's squad can be self-sufficient for eight years.

    The troops also used surplus food expenses and allowances to develop animal husbandry. A total of more than 10,000 cattle, more than 168,000 sheep, more than 12,000 pigs, and more than 33,000 chickens were raised throughout the year.

    In addition, more than 1.15 million meters of canals were built, which can irrigate 1.27 million mu of fertile land. More than 9,000 houses were built. More than 430 various farms, mines, and workshops were built. More than 220,000 trees were planted (about half of which can survive). And other national engineering buildings were built.

    In production, because the troops correctly implemented the ethnic policy and observed mass discipline, and helped solve the difficulties of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in terms of water use, cultivated land, and seeds, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the People's Liberation Army. The harmonious relationship between the army and the people strengthened the close unity between the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    On the basis of the production victory in the past year, in addition to the fact that the commanders and fighters of some troops have to assume the tasks of defending the national defense, consolidating security, and strengthening training, the troops engaged in production are actively preparing to welcome the even greater production tasks this year. In this year's production, labor enthusiasm and science and technology are further combined, and they believe that they will make greater achievements. They are preparing to strive to complete the annual grain self-sufficiency and to achieve the standard yield of various crops.

    Due to their own participation in labor production, the commanders and fighters wrote the following verses with full of victorious confidence in the construction of Xinjiang:

    "People say Xinjiang is too desolate, but they don't know Xinjiang has treasures;
    Labor can turn the world upside down, Xinjiang will surely become a paradise."

### 生产战线上的伟大胜利  记驻新疆人民解放军一九五○年的大生产运动

　　生产战线上的伟大胜利
　　记驻新疆人民解放军一九五○年的大生产运动
　　胡中
  一、“我要高呼：解放军教育了新疆人民。”
    驻新疆中国人民解放军一九五○年所进行的大生产运动，有着巨大的意义。它不仅解决了各地部队的粮食供应问题，节省了巨大的粮食运费开支，改善了部队生活，更重要的，是它影响并推进了新疆各族人民的经济生活。
    首先，是新疆各族人民在解放军勤劳生产的感召下，对劳动的看法开始有了改变。不以劳动为荣反以劳动为耻的旧社会的传统寄生思想，开始销声敛迹了。在迪化、伊宁等城市里，大批机关干部及各阶层人民，协同解放军投入了修筑乌鲁木齐河堤岸和挖修皇渠的劳动；在乡村，广大劳动人民的劳动热情，已被激发起来，掀起了开荒、修渠的热潮。
    其次，是打破了新疆各族人民传统的、落后的耕作法。传统的看法，认为北疆气候寒冷，不能长棉花。但解放军在沙湾、景化一带应用苏联棉种试种棉花已获成功。每亩棉田平均产皮棉六十市斤，好的达百市斤。这说明北疆非但能种棉花，而且有很好的收获量。传统的看法，认为新疆不能种植茶树，致新疆人民在生活上每天必需的砖茶，要远从湖南运来。但解放军在库尔勒等地试种的茶树长的很好，说明南疆是可能种植茶树的。这样，北疆的棉，南疆的茶，如能示范推广，普遍种植起来，对新疆人民的经济生活，将有莫大的意义。
    新疆人民传统的耕作法，是撒了种便等着收割，不锄草也不上肥。种的地多，但每亩地的收获量低。解放军带来了较进步的农作法，收成好的稻子每亩达千余市斤，使各地人民相信了要精耕细作才会有好收成。他们逐渐学会了拾粪施肥，锄草间苗。新疆人民种稻子的传统习惯是撒种，而且种得稠。解放军在几个地区试验插秧和点种，稻长得好，收成也高，并且比撒种节省水量。插秧和点种的大量推行，不仅可以增加稻的收获量，而且因用水节省并可增加耕地面积。
    因此，去年十月间在迪化举办的全疆生产展览会上，七十岁的俄罗斯族教员迪牙阔夫，在看到解放军参加生产建设的各种像片和图表以后，他在意见簿中兴奋地写道：“我要高呼，解放军教育了新疆人民。”
  二、向风雪、戈壁和饥寒搏斗！
    去年的庄稼是丰收的，各地部队都打起新仓来储藏他们收获的粮食。当一担一担的粮食被运进新仓的时候，指战员们记起了刚到生产地区时那一段和风雪、戈壁沙漠以及饥饿寒冷搏斗的日子。
    去年三月，远驻在帕米尔高原下面的人民解放军，开始从吐鲁蕃徒步行军，横跨了三千六百里的戈壁沙漠，到达了驻地。当地没有人烟，他们便搭起帐篷；帐篷不够睡，便睡在露天下面；那时冰雪还封着大地，风大生不着火，便吃不上饭，没有油、菜，就靠吃盐水下饭。
    在这样的情况下面，他们开始进行着大规模的生产运动，用自己的手来改善自己的生活。最初，困难的情形是难以想像的。驻伊宁某团警卫连上山开荒时，一天只吃一顿饭，连一口水也喝不到，每人噙着一根湿草而坚持劳动。在玛纳斯河岸生产的部队，因为粮食运输困难，有时候吃的是无法磨成面粉的囫囵麦子，有时连囫囵麦子也吃不上。没有菜蔬，部队挖着野生的菜吃。部队以艰苦奋斗的精神，克服着种种困难。没有生产工具，自己就动手制作；没有畜力，就用人力拉犁，没有种籽，部队就改吃杂粮，把麦子节省下来作为种籽。有不少单位，忍受了成群蚊虫的叮咬，蒙起面具，坚持着开垦草根与红柳根密如蛛网的草地。
    经过了一年的辛勤劳作，他们的劳动收到了美好的成果，荒凉的新疆开始改变着原来的面貌。在帕米尔高原、在伊宁、在玛纳斯河岸以及其他各地，原来没有人烟的地方，现在建筑起了房舍。原来的一片荒原，现在种起了庄稼，放牧着成群的牛羊。新的水渠挖起来了，荒地开垦起来了，新的农庄建立起来了，田野间荡漾着新的声音——部队劳动时愉快的歌声和欢笑声。
  三、革命英雄主义
    一年来，指战员们是在不妨碍军事任务的前提下，以革命英雄主义的精神投入了生产战线的。女同志们和炊事员变工，她们担水、送饭、打柴，还帮着在地里拾草根、点种籽；炊事员们也打柴种菜。部队家属们也组织起来参加生产。担任生产任务的部队，全体人员卷入了劳动生产的热潮。不少指战员们双手都打了血泡还坚持开荒，不肯休息；有时水渠决口了，立即有指战员们冒着澈骨的寒冷，跳下水去，用身体堵住缺口抢修。这些都充分表现了中国人民解放军的崇高品质。
    部队里普遍展开了革命英雄主义的生产竞赛和群众性的表扬鼓励。政治工作人员所创造的宣传鼓动方式是多种多样的。有带红花、在名册上点红蓝黑点、记功劳簿、升降图表、活动墙报、广播、班排组合竞赛、夺红旗运动、夺钁头运动（以标准钁头奖给模范单位或个人）、物质奖励、家属慰问等等。这些政治工作，鼓舞了指战员们的劳动热情，正如在战斗中涌现了无数战斗英雄一样，在劳动生产战线上也涌现出大批劳动模范和模范工作者。仅据某部统计，一年来全师产生了三个模范连、六个模范排、五个模范班、六百九十二位劳动模范和模范工作者；而在历年战争中久经考验的战斗英雄们，一经转入生产战线，就成了劳动模范。
    特别显明的例子，如出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的某军战斗英雄陈才德，在生产中积极带头，浇棉田时水渠冲了一丈多的缺口，他自己首先下水，在半腰深的水里堵了一夜，个人开荒则达到二十八亩四分；又如连续突刺一千六百余次的战斗英雄郭仰森，在生产中首先订出全班生产计划，领导全班完成每人开荒十七亩的计划，他本人则完成了二十亩；在三年中立过十一个功的战斗英雄陈全魁，在生产中第一天开荒即达一亩九分五，为全团最高纪录，以后每天开荒三亩。陈全魁所领导的排，每人平均都开荒二亩以上。
  四、劳动生产战线上的伟大胜利
    一年来的劳动，有了巨大收获。全疆部队共开垦土地八十三万余亩，加上去年压种冬麦十余万亩，共开荒达百万亩。其中除十七万余亩地因水、旱、虫灾遭受损失，没有收成或收成很少外，其他均获丰收。据统计，共收获粗细粮约七千万斤，特种作物（棉、麻等）五百九十余万斤，油料饲料七百三十七万余斤，瓜果菜蔬四千五百二十四万余斤。
    某几个单位成绩更大。某团开荒五万三千余亩，收获可供该团一年半至二年的食用；某团除农业生产外，另兴修国家工程建筑，可供该团全年除服装以外的全部开支。如以连队为单位来计算，某团一营一连可自给五年；三连可自给三十五个月，而该连战斗英雄宋献银同志全年个人垦地八十五亩，收获可供一个人十年的食用，宋献银班的收获可自给八年。
    部队又用节余的伙食费和津贴发展了畜牧业。全年共饲养牛万余头，羊十六万八千余头，猪一万二千余口，鸡三万三千余只。
    此外，兴修水渠一百十五万余公尺，能灌溉一百二十七万亩良田。建筑房舍九千余间。修建各种场矿作坊四百三十余处。植树二十二万余株（约半数能活）。并修筑了其他国家工程建筑。
    在生产中，由于部队正确地执行了民族政策和遵守群众纪律，并在用水、耕地、种籽等方面帮助解决了各族劳动人民的困难，新疆各族人民对人民解放军表示了衷心的感激。融洽的军民关系，加强了新疆各民族间的亲密团结。
    在一年来生产胜利的基础上，除一部分部队的指战员们要担任保卫国防，巩固治安及加强训练的任务以外，担任生产任务的部队，正在积极准备迎接今年更巨大的生产任务。在今年的生产中，劳动热情和科学技术更进一步地结合起来，他们相信将会做出更大的成绩。他们正准备为完成全年粮食自给，为达到各种作物的标准产量而奋斗。
    指战员们由于自己亲身参加劳动生产的体会，他们对新疆的建设满怀胜利信心地写了下面的诗句：
    “人说新疆太荒凉，不知新疆有宝藏；
    劳动能够翻天地，新疆定会变天堂。”
