　　Northeast Military Region's On-the-Job Cadre Cultural School
    Trial Operation for One Year Yields Experience

    [This Dispatch] The Northeast Military Region's On-the-Job Cadre Cultural School has achieved considerable success after one year of trial operation. As of the end of last October, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 24 cultural schools for机关cadres, 71 elementary school classes, and 29 middle school classes have been established, with over 3,000 cadres participating in learning. After several months of study, the cadres' cultural level has significantly improved. For example, those who previously knew relatively few characters have now learned 600 to 800 characters; those who had not studied arithmetic before have now completed the four basic operations with integers.

    The experience of the trial operation has proven that the organizational form of the机关 cultural school is the most effective way to improve the cultural level of on-the-job cadres. However, in order to ensure the implementation of the learning plan, it is first necessary to establish a unified leadership structure—the School Affairs Committee. The candidates for the School Affairs Committee should be the administrative leaders of each unit. Without strong and effective leadership, the work cannot be promoted. Secondly, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth mobilization among the cadres participating in the study to overcome the erroneous thinking of some students, such as "too busy with work to study" and "too old and slow-witted, studying is useless"; at the same time, it is necessary to criticize some students' eagerness for quick success and their unrealistic learning attitudes. Only in this way can everyone maintain a full learning mood. Furthermore, it is necessary to organize the study classes well, because the cadres participating in the study generally have a high level of Chinese language but a low level of arithmetic.

    Once the leadership structure is established, ideological mobilization is carried out, and study classes are organized, what other issues should be paid attention to? First,机关 leaders and responsible cadres must lead by example, take the lead in participating in learning, and abide by the system. This is an important factor in running a good机关 cultural school. The Liaodong Military Region Cultural School is an example. Due to the active participation of Deputy Commander Ouyang Jiaxiang, he motivated all the students and kept them in a strong learning mood. Second, it is necessary to strictly implement various systems. If there is no strict system of roll call and leave application, absenteeism cannot be avoided. Other systems such as examinations and rewards and punishments should also be strictly implemented. Third, teachers must have a serious and responsible work attitude and humbly learn from the masses; at the same time, give full play to the role of teaching groups, absorb work experience, and improve teaching methods. This solves the weaknesses of teachers' low level and lack of experience. Fourth, it is necessary to establish a reasonable and effective make-up system, because all students are on-the-job cadres, and due to work reasons, the phenomenon of asking for leave is difficult to avoid. Therefore, how to organize make-up lessons for those who ask for leave on official business is also an important issue.

### 东北军区在职干部文化学校  试办一年取得经验

　　东北军区在职干部文化学校
    试办一年取得经验
    【本报讯】东北军区在职干部文化学校，试办一年来，已取得相当的成绩。截至去年十月底止，据不完全统计，共成立了机关干部文化学校二十四处、小学七十一个班、中学二十九个班，参加学习的干部达三千余人。经过几个月学习之后，干部的文化程度有了显著的提高，如过去识字较少的，现在已学会了六百到八百个生字；过去没学过算术的，现在已学完了整数四则。
    试办的经验，证明了机关文化学校这种组织形式，乃是提高在职干部文化水平的最有效的办法。但为了保证学习计划的实现，首先必须建立统一的领导机构——校务委员会。参加校委会的人选，应该是各单位的行政负责同志。如果没有坚强有力的领导，工作是无法推动的。其次，必须在参加学习的干部中进行广泛深入地动员，克服部分学员中的“工作忙，学不了”、“年纪大、脑筋笨，学了也白搭”等等错误思想；同时，要批评某些学员的急于求成、好高鹜远的学习态度。这样才能使大家保持饱满的学习情绪。再是要把学习班编好，因为参加学习的干部，普遍是国文程度高、算术程度低。
    领导机构建立起来了，也做了思想动员，学习班也编好了，还应该注意些什么问题呢？第一，机关首长、负责干部必须以身作则，带头参加学习，遵守制度。这是搞好机关文化学校的一个重要因素。辽东军区文化学校，便是一个例子，由于副司令员欧阳稼祥同志的积极参加学习，带动了全体学员，并使他们经常保持旺盛的学习情绪。第二，要认真执行各项制度。假如没有严格的点名请假制度，就无法避免旷课现象。其他如考试、奖惩等制度，亦应严格的执行。第三，教员要有认真负责、虚心向群众学习的工作态度；同时，发挥教学小组的作用，吸取工作经验，改进教学方法。这样就解决了教员水平不高和缺乏经验的弱点。第四，要建立合理有效的补课制度，因为学员全是在职干部，由于工作的关系，请假的现象是难于避免的。因此，如何组织请假公出人员补课也是一个重要问题。
