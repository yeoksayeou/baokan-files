    纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    【新华社二十日讯】我国各人民团体负责人为纪念二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”的来临，特撰写祝词，表示对殖民地国家人民与青年反对帝国主义的斗争的关怀与支持。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若在祝词中写道：“殖民地是帝国主义的生命线，殖民制度的废除便是帝国主义的灭亡。反对殖民制度的烽火快要燃遍全世界，尽管帝国主义者疯狂地镇压，挽救不了他自己的必然命运。中朝两国人民的伟大胜利，便是明证。更勇敢、更团结、早些把罪恶的制度消灭。”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅在祝词中说：“在反对殖民制度斗争日这一天，向全世界的战斗青年致崇高的敬意，并祝贺你们在斗争中获得更大的胜利。”
    中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志在祝词中，表示向正在为争取民主、民族独立而斗争的青年们致以亲切热烈的敬礼。他希望“全世界爱好和平的人民与青年加紧团结，彻底粉碎帝国主义的侵略，反对美国单独片面对日媾和重新武装日本的阴谋。”
