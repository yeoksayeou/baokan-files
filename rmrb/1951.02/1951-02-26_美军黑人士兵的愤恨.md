　　American Black Soldiers' Resentment

　　(By our reporter Tan Wenrui)

　　Joseph Wyatt, an apprentice in a drugstore in Virginia City, USA, was discriminated against and mistreated by white people everywhere because of his black skin. He was refused admission to white schools and hotels, could not use the same toilets as white people, had to sit in a specific class on buses, and was constantly subjected to bullying. He thought every day: "How can I find a place to live without racial discrimination?" The phrase "there is no racial discrimination in the army" on the recruitment advertisements touched his heartstrings the year before last, prompting him to give up his original profession and register for the army. But after entering the training camp, he felt that it was not the case, and after being assigned to the army, he realized that he had been completely deceived. Although he and the white soldiers wore the same uniforms and received the same amount of money.

　　In the prisoner-of-war camp in Korea, Wyatt complained bitterly: "We cannot eat at the same table as white people, live in the same barracks, or participate in the same movies and other entertainment activities. When stationed, the good houses are occupied by white people; black people do heavy work such as repairing bridges and roads; when fighting, we black people are always asked to take on dangerous tasks, while white people smoke, drink, and comment in safer places. If we don't do well, we will be criticized and scolded by them. The American military authorities condone and encourage all kinds of discriminatory behavior against us black people by white officers and soldiers. I have seen through it." He was eager to know whether China and the Soviet Union treat people of all races equally. He said angrily: "As long as there is any country in the world without racial discrimination, I am willing to move my wife, children, and entire family out of fucking America!"

　　Clifford Allen, a black veteran of the 24th Division who participated in World War II, worked hard in the army for eight years before climbing to the rank of captain. He said: "I am considered relatively lucky to have become a captain, but if my skin were white, I should have been a lieutenant colonel or colonel long ago. In the army, a black corporal and a white corporal receive the same salary, which makes it seem that black and white people are treated the same. In reality, a capable black person is often in a lower position than a weak white person, and it is a hundred times more difficult for black people to be promoted than white people. There are many black people serving as squad leaders in the American army because the job of a squad leader is dangerous and hard. They want black people to risk their lives."

　　Andrew Frankel, a black medic from the U.S. Second Division, was originally a student at Northwestern University in the United States. He enlisted in the army during World War II and has served in the army for six years, but is still a sergeant. He was told, "You should be proud because you are the first black person we have ever accepted in this division."

　　In the prisoner-of-war camp, black and white American prisoners of war are treated equally by us, but those white people still try to bully the black people. When serving food, they always give the black prisoners less. They make the black people do the work of chopping firewood and carrying water. But the black people understand that this is no longer a place for white people to show off their power. They are unwilling to be insulted and harmed again. They argue with the white people and sometimes even fight them. The black prisoners said, "When we are tough, those cowards become honest!"

　　The black people have no good feelings about the American army at all. They extremely hate and resent the war of aggression against Korea launched by American imperialism. When they talk about the American army, the black prisoners always use the pronoun "they" instead of "we." After talking with the black prisoners, one can understand why a black company of 148 men from the 25th Division would collectively lay down their weapons.

　　美军黑人士兵的愤恨
    （本报记者　谭文瑞）
    一个美国维珍尼亚城药铺中的学徒约瑟夫·维亚特（Joseph Wyatt）因为长着黑皮肤而到处受白人的歧视和虐待，被拒绝进白人的学校和旅馆，不能和白人用同一的厕所，在公共汽车中也要坐在特定的等级，到处受气，脑子里天天在想：“怎样能找到一个没有种族歧视的地方生活就好了。”在前年，募兵广告上“军队中没有种族歧视”的字句打动了他的心弦，使他毅然放弃了本来的职业，去登记入伍。但是当他进了训练营后，他就感觉到并不是那么一回事，编入军队以后，更明白了他完全受了骗，虽然他和白人士兵穿着同样的制服，拿着同样数目的钱。
    在朝鲜的俘虏营中，维亚特愤懑地诉说道：“我们不能和白人在同一张桌子上吃饭，在同一个营房中住宿，在一块参加看电影等娱乐活动。驻扎的时候，好的房子都是白人占据；修桥补路等繁重的工作则由我们黑人去做；打仗的时候，一定叫我们黑人去担任危险的任务，白人们在比较安全的地方抽烟、喝酒、发议论，我们做不好还要受他们批评责骂。美国的军队当局就纵容和鼓励白人官兵对我们黑人的种种歧视行为，我算是看透了。”他很渴望知道中国和苏联是否平等对待各种族的人民，他愤激地说：“只要世界上有任何没有种族歧视的国家，我愿把老婆孩子全家搬出他妈的美国！”
    二十四师的一个参加过第二次世界大战的黑人老兵克里佛·阿伦（Crifford Allen）在军队中苦干了八年才爬到了上尉的阶级，他说：“我算是比较幸运的，当了上尉，但是如果我的皮肤是白色的话，我早就应该是中校或者上校了。在军队中一个黑人的上等兵和一个白人的上等兵的薪金是一样的，这样使人看来好像真的黑人和白人受着同样的待遇，实际上一个能力强的黑人往往比一个能力弱的白人位置低，而且黑人的晋升也比白人困难百倍。美国军队里有不少黑人当伍长的，原因是伍长这份差事危险而辛苦，他们就是要黑人去卖命。”
    美国第二师的一个黑人军医安德烈·法兰柯（Andrew Frankel）本来是美国西北大学的学生，在第二次世界大战时就入了伍，在军队中服务已有六个年头，现在还是一个军曹。而他却被告诉说：“你应该骄傲，因为你是我们这一师有史以来第一次接受的黑人。”
    在俘虏营中，黑人和白人的美军俘虏是受着我们同等的待遇的，但是那些白人却依然企图对黑人们加以欺凌，吃饭时，给黑人俘虏盛饭总是盛得少些，打柴挑水的工作，都让黑人去干。但是黑人们明白这里已经不是白人们逞威风的地方了，他们不甘再受侮辱与损害，他们和白人们争论，甚至有时不惜和他们打架。黑人俘虏们说：“当我们强硬的时候，那些孱头们就老实了！”
    黑人们对于美国军队是完全没有好感的，他们极度憎恶和怨恨美国帝国主义发动的侵略朝鲜战争。当他们说到美军的时候，黑人俘虏们总是用“他们”而不是用“我们”这个代名词，和黑人俘虏们谈话后，就可以理解为什么二十五师一百四十八人的一个黑人连会集体放下武器。
