Reactions to Criticism from the People's Daily
            Hunyuan Distillery Accepts Criticism and Improves Work
    Editor:
    After the People's Daily published on January 21st the criticism from Guo Tao of the CCP Hunyuan County Committee Propaganda Department regarding our factory's excessive extension of working hours, which caused workers to become ill and the alcohol production rate to decrease, the Party, government, and labor union leaders at all levels in our county helped our factory conduct an inspection. We now offer the following review: Due to excessive working hours, four of the six distilleries experienced "dropping row" (a general term for a sharp decline in alcohol production rate and quality). This was due to the serious existence of a purely task-oriented viewpoint in the minds of our administrative leaders (general working hours extended from twelve to thirteen or fourteen hours, sometimes reaching sixteen or seventeen hours during "dropping row"). The excessive extension of working hours severely damaged the workers' health. For example, when stoker Shi Si fell into the pool, we thought it was because of the misty vapors obscuring the ground, not realizing it was related to the long working hours and excessive fatigue. This disregard for workers' interests also shows that our administrative leadership has not yet established a clear ideology of relying on the working class, nor has it consciously observed labor policies, resulting in unnecessary losses. This is truly an egregious bureaucratic style. After this inspection, we are determined to strengthen our study, strengthen the combination of labor union and administrative work, and truly rely on workers to improve factory management. We express our gratitude to the comrades of the County Federation of Trade Unions for their assistance. As for the excessive extension of working hours, it has now been corrected as follows: According to workers' opinions, the No. 5 large distillery has been reduced from eight workers burning 2,500 catties of sorghum per day to 2,000 catties per day, and the No. 6 distillery has been reduced from nine workers burning 2,800 catties of sorghum per day to 2,240 catties per day. From now on, each of the four small distilleries will be reduced from the original five workers burning 1,080 catties of sorghum per day to 840 catties per day. This roughly restores the working hours to what they were before November. In addition, one large and one small distillery will be added to strive to maintain the original output.

            Beijing Municipal Third Hospital's Review of Medical Style
    Editor:
    The People's Daily published on January 28th an article about Sun Zhikui of the Tram Company's South Converter Station, who was treated at our hospital for a fall injury, and whose wound was carelessly stitched by the on-duty doctor, resulting in adverse consequences. This fully demonstrates that the doctor was careless and irresponsible towards the injured. In order to improve our work, we held a general meeting in the surgery department, conducted an inspection, severely criticized the on-duty doctor Xing Keliang, and made a review at a hospital-wide conference to educate all staff and serve as a warning for future work. The occurrence of this incident also shows that the hospital leadership's supervision and education of staff is insufficient; we deeply apologize to Comrade Sun Zhikui.

            Dr. Xing Keliang's Review
    The sequence of events is as follows: Comrade Sun Zhikui, who works at the Tram Company, came to our hospital's emergency room on the afternoon of November 19, 1950, due to a cut on his left thigh caused by a basin.
    I was on duty that day. After asking about his medical history and examining the wound, I immediately began washing the wound with saline, disinfecting it, and then stitching it up. I also injected tetanus antitoxin and prescribed anti-inflammatory tablets, instructing him to return in two days to have the wound checked. The patient returned to the hospital for a follow-up visit six days later. The wound had healed, so I removed the stitches, and the patient returned home.
    On January 28th, the People's Daily reported that Comrade Sun Zhikui's wound suppurated after returning home, and that broken pieces of the basin were removed from the wound. After reading the report, I immediately reviewed the treatment of Comrade Sun Zhikui as follows:
    First of all, I was careless in my work. Due to a careless examination of the wound, I failed to discover that the basin fragments had not been removed, which led to suppuration and affected the patient's health, hindering his work. Secondly, I did not humbly accept the patient's opinions during the treatment, causing the patient unnecessary suffering. All of this demonstrates that my spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people is insufficient.
    I fully accept the opinions raised by Comrade Qu Qingzhong and am very grateful because his criticism enabled me to recognize my own mistakes and correct my poor work attitude. In the future, I will strive to correct my shortcomings and wholeheartedly serve the people.

### 对人民日报批评的反应

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　对人民日报批评的反应
            浑源酒厂接受批评改进工作
    编辑同志：
    一月二十一日人民日报刊载中共浑源县县委宣传部郭涛同志对本厂因过分延长工时、使工人闹病、产酒率降低的批评后，我县党、政、工各级领导即帮助本厂进行了检查。对此我们现作检讨如下：本厂因工作时间过长，六个烧锅中有四个烧锅发生掉排现象（即产酒率和质量骤然降低的通称）。这是由于我们行政领导思想上严重地存在着单纯任务观点所致（一般工时由十二小时延长到十三、四个小时。掉排时有时达十六、七个小时）。由于工时过度延长，就严重地损害了工人的健康。如烧火工人石四掉进池子里时，我们还认为是因汽雾迷蒙，看不清地面而失足；未想到是和工时长、过度劳累有关。这样漠视工人利益，也说明我们行政领导上还没有树立起明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，更没有自觉的遵守劳动政策，以致招来了不应有的损失。这实在是一种恶劣的官僚主义的作风。经过这次的检查，我们下决心加强学习，加强工会与行政工作的互相结合，确实依靠工人改善工厂管理。对县工会同志的帮助，我们表示感谢。至于过分延长工时的情况，现已纠正如下：根据工人意见，五号大烧锅由八名工人原日烧二千五百斤红粮减为日烧二千斤，六号烧锅由九名工人日烧二千八百斤红粮减为日烧二千二百四十斤。四个小烧锅从即日起各由原五个工人日烧红粮一千零八十斤减为日烧八百四十斤。大致恢复到十一月份前的工时。此外并增设大小烧锅各一，以争取维持原来产量。

            京市市立第三医院关于医疗作风的检讨
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月二十八日刊登电车公司南变流厂孙志魁同志因跌伤在我院治疗，经值班大夫草率缝合，以致产生不良后果，这完全说明该医生粗枝大叶，对伤员不负责。我们为了改进工作，在外科方面开了全体会议，进行了检查，对值班医生邢克良予以严格的批评，并在全院大会上作了检讨，借以教育全院人员，作今后工作中的警惕。这件事情的发生，也说明医院领导上，对工作人员督导教育不够；我们对孙志魁同志深致歉意。
                         北京市人民政府公共卫生局第三医院
                                                    二月三日
            邢克良医生的检讨
    事情的经过是这样的：孙志魁同志在电车公司服务，于一九五○年十一月十九日下午因左大腿被盆割伤而来本院急诊。
    当日是由我值班，问完病历，检查伤口完毕，即开始用盐水洗涤伤口，消毒后即行缝合，并注射破伤风血清及内服消炎片，嘱二日后来看伤口。病人于六日后来院复诊，伤口已愈合，于是拆线后病人即回去。
    一月二十八日人民日报载孙志魁同志回去后伤口化脓，并有破碎盆片自伤口取出等情形，当我看到报后，即对孙志魁同志治疗经过作检讨如下：
    首先是工作上粗枝大叶，由于检查伤口粗心，以致未发现盆片没有取出而化脓，影响了病人的健康，妨碍了工作。其次，在治疗当中不虚心接受病人意见，致病人受了不必要的痛苦。这都说明了我全心全意为人民服务的精神不够。
    屈庆忠同志提的意见，我完全接受，并非常感谢，因为他的批评使我自己能认识到自己的错误，使不良的工作态度得以改正。今后我将努力改正自己的缺点，来全心全意为人民服务。
