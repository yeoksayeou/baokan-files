Further Unite and Educate Women Under the Great Banner of Patriotism
Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

The central political task of the current Chinese women's movement is to continue mobilizing all women to participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, so that the movement among women to resist America and aid Korea can be further expanded and deepened nationwide. In areas where women have already been mobilized, efforts should be continued to ensure that the movement truly reaches every household and is known to every woman and child. In areas where women have not yet been mobilized or have not been mobilized sufficiently (such as the vast rural areas and some cities), prompt mobilization should be carried out to achieve universal expansion. Regardless of the type of area, special attention should be paid to absorbing women who are usually not concerned with politics or have few opportunities to participate in social and political activities, striving to ensure that all women can recognize and participate in the great patriotic movement from their own positions.

Secondly, the women's movement to resist America and aid Korea should be combined with regular work, that is, closely combined with the continued implementation of the resolutions of the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Federation. Past experience has fully demonstrated that in places where attention is paid to women's work and women's work is done well, it is easy to widely and deeply mobilize women to participate in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Similarly, wherever patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea is deeply carried out, the consciousness of the women's masses is raised, and all regular work can be completed better and faster. In this way, the patriotic enthusiasm of the women's masses can be transformed into practical action, strengthening the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, and the women's liberation work can be further promoted. This approach is very necessary and completely possible. For example, the principle of "the urban women's movement taking production as its central task should be further integrated with practice" put forward by the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting has indeed been further realized in this movement to resist America and aid Korea. In places where the work has been done well, many female workers have actively participated in patriotic production competitions, and production efficiency has been improved. Many family members of employees have improved their housework to assist their husbands and children in participating in production competitions, and a large number of housewives have also actively participated in cotton-padding work, which not only helped frontline soldiers sew a large number of military clothes and bedding, but also subsidized family life, improved their social status, established their own organizations, and produced many new activists. This enables women from all strata, various professions, and even housewives to have the opportunity to contribute their strength and participate in the great patriotic movement. For example, in this movement, many women who did not usually pay attention to politics or were deeply deceived by American imperialist propaganda also actively participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Many patriotic mothers and wives personally sent their husbands and children to join the Volunteer Army and military cadre schools. Furthermore, female students, female faculty and staff, and their family members in church schools also enthusiastically launched movements to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism and oppose Austin's slander. Female believers of Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism are also participating in the church reform movement and the patriotic movement. Therefore, this great patriotic movement has indeed become universal among the vast number of women in all strata, making the united front of women unprecedentedly expanded and consolidated, and accelerating the realization of the policy of "strengthening and expanding the unity of women in all strata" put forward by the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting.

However, all this is only a good start. The development of the movement is very uneven. Only the women in some large and medium-sized cities have been mobilized to advance in coordination with the entire movement. Nationwide, the mobilization is still insufficient. Even in places where mobilization has been carried out, it is not widespread or deep enough, and it has not been fully combined with regular work. In view of this situation, in order to continue to expand and deepen the women's movement to resist America and aid Korea, and to combine it with the continued implementation of the resolutions of the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Federation, the following three points must be noted:

First, in expanding and deepening the entire movement to resist America and aid Korea, in order to mobilize various women's masses to do a good job in production and work, it is necessary to gradually solve the special difficulties of women, protect women's vital interests, and serve women within the scope of possibility. Only by taking care of the special practical situation of women can the vast majority of women be mobilized and the enthusiasm of women in production and work be improved. In this movement to resist America and aid Korea, some places have created very good experiences. For example, in the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7, when a patriotic production competition was launched in November last year, the performance of female workers was generally inferior to that of male workers. In October, the attendance rate of all employees was 95%, while the attendance rate of female workers was 81.5%. However, the number of female workers accounted for more than one-third of the total number of employees in the factory. If the enthusiasm of female workers is not improved, it will greatly affect the factory's patriotic production competition. Therefore, the trade union held various large and small meetings for female workers to conduct in-depth education and clear their minds. The enthusiasm of many female workers was improved, and they voluntarily set the attendance rate to 100%. However, as a result, in order to ensure the attendance rate, individual female workers still worked hard after menstruation, causing excessive bleeding and falling ill. Individual mothers did not feed their children on time, which damaged the children's health and affected the relationship between husband and wife. Some female workers could not persist and secretly modified the production plan. Seeing this situation, the factory's administrative authorities and the trade union gained an in-depth understanding and initially solved the special difficulties of female workers, specifically stipulating the following four measures: (1) The time for female workers to feed their children is not included in the quota. (2) Maternity leave is not included in sick leave or personal leave. (3) For female workers with weak bodies, production plans are formulated according to their physical conditions. (4) The trade union should pay attention to understanding the ideological situation of female workers and seize the opportunity to persuade and educate them. Therefore, in the first ten days of November, the attendance rate of female workers increased to 94%, only 1% lower than that of male workers. Even mothers could participate in the competition to seize the red flag, and the factory's patriotic production was greatly improved (quoted from a report by Comrade Bi Guang, correspondent of Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7). In order to mobilize mothers to participate in the meetings to resist America and aid Korea, some urban women's federations also created temporary childcare stations when holding meetings, which well accommodated the children and allowed the mothers to attend the meetings with peace of mind. There are similar experiences in rural work. When the Shanxi Provincial Women's Federation summarized the mobilization of rural women to participate in spring plowing and production in 1950, some cadres simply believed that "mobilizing women to the fields is 'mobilization,' and participating in production can 'liberate' them," without taking into account family interests or solving the special problems of women. Therefore, not only was the production enthusiasm of women not high, but even male farmers opposed it. Qin County conducted an in-depth inspection and found that "many areas women did not go to the fields because of family disharmony and dissatisfaction with marriage. At first, the cadres were afraid of 'chaos in the world and were unwilling to solve it.' After persuasion, the cadres helped the women solve the problems specifically according to the different situations. After the problems were solved, the women's production enthusiasm increased. Some women could not go to the fields to produce because of the burden of their children. The elderly in the mutual aid groups changed shifts to take care of the children, and proposed measures such as women breastfeeding their children on time and going home early to cook, which solved the difficulties of not being able to go to the fields due to family affairs… ensuring the realization of the production plan." As a result, not only did the production enthusiasm of women increase, but even men reflected that "if women were not liberated, they could not work with us" (quoted from the summary report of the Shanxi Provincial Women's Federation on mobilizing women to participate in spring plowing and production in 1950).

In the past, because we did not explain these truths to everyone well and repeatedly, some local women's federations could only generally abide by the overall tasks proposed by the People's Government for all the people and the resolutions of the higher-level democratic women's federations when deciding on work, which is good. It has played a certain role in uniting the efforts of all men and women to complete the central task at hand in a consistent and concentrated manner. However, on the other hand, in terms of how to link the overall tasks with the vital interests and daily difficulties of women, and to assume the natural responsibility of our women's groups to protect women's interests, it is generally not done well. When mobilizing women to complete the tasks related to the long-term interests of all the people and women's liberation, they did not fully and deeply understand how to proceed from the actual situation of the women's masses. Therefore, the breadth and depth of our mobilization of women has been greatly limited, and even some phenomena of being divorced from the masses have been created.

We hope that the women's federations in various places will earnestly pay attention to correcting this shortcoming; at the same time, we also request that the People's Government and all relevant parties can support and approve the necessary measures to protect the special interests of women as much as possible, and provide various powerful assistance.

Second, always pay attention to carrying out propaganda and education work among the women's masses. This is a prerequisite for improving the political and cultural level of women and enabling women to participate in various jobs alongside men, and it is also the due responsibility of women's organizations. The matter is very clear, because of the long-term constraints of the old society, women are generally behind men and need to be educated harder; and our women's federations are the women's own groups, we must use the method of persuasion and education to lead and promote work, and we should pay more attention to propaganda and education work. Some women's federations in the past did not pay enough attention to propaganda and education work, or regarded it as temporary work, which should be corrected. The central content of current propaganda and education includes the following three points: (A) Constantly carry out education against American imperialism, advocating patriotism and internationalism, thoroughly and completely eradicate the influence of American imperialism among Chinese women, enhance national self-esteem, eliminate national inferiority, and inspire the enthusiasm for loving the people and loving the motherland. (B) Publicize the policies and laws of the central and local People's Governments, so that the women's masses can understand what the People's Government is doing, how it is doing it, and what relationship it has with women, and enlighten the women's masses to consciously abide by laws and regulations and implement policies. (C) Constantly use concrete facts and real people to publicize the policy and ideology of equality between men and women, especially the work guidelines and specific tasks of the local women's federations, in order to improve women's conscious participation in women's work and their own organizations.

The method of carrying out propaganda and education must proceed from the personal experience of the women's masses and gradually improve in order to enhance the efficiency of education. Secondly, we must use various forms of propaganda that are popular and loved by the masses, especially the artistic forms that are loved by the women's masses, so that the content of education can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Finally, it must be emphasized that propaganda and education work belongs to the category of ideology, and we must proceed from the actual situation of women, and through long-term unremitting efforts, carry out regularly and systematically, in order to obtain certain results. Therefore, our women's federations at all levels should study the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People's Masses in the Whole Party" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, train female propagandists, and provide male and female propagandists with propaganda materials related to women and children, relying on this group of male and female propagandists to regularly carry out propaganda and education work among the women's masses. Secondly, we should study the decision on vocational education for workers and peasants issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, assist the government, mobilize women to participate in vocational schools for workers, people's schools, literacy classes, winter schools, etc., to strengthen the education work for female workers, peasants, and all women with low cultural levels. In addition, we should also appropriately strive for various vocational and technical training classes and cadre schools to include a certain number of women. For this reason, women's federations at all levels should plan to help the propaganda and education departments establish regular business, improve working methods, strengthen work efficiency, and promote relevant institutions and organizations to pay attention to carrying out propaganda and education work among the women's masses.

Third, unite all patriotic and democratic women and expand the organization of women's masses. The Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Federation in September last year clearly stipulated that "from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the democratic women's federations at all levels, they are all the broadest united front organizations under the leadership of the working class, based on working-class and peasant women, uniting petty-bourgeois women, national bourgeois women, and all patriotic and democratic women." Not only that, but our democratic women's federations themselves are organizations of democratic women's masses, and should pay more attention to uniting women from all democratic strata, all democratic parties, all nationalities, and various religions. This should not only include women from all walks of life, but also absorb a considerable number of housewives in order to achieve the great unity of all patriotic and democratic women. Moreover, for women of any stratum or any sector, we should not only absorb the progressive elements among them, but also unite the middle elements and strive for the backward elements. Only in this way can we organize women more widely and make our groups truly broad mass organizations of democratic women. In the past, when carrying out women's work in urban and rural areas, most local women's federations were generally able to adhere to the policy of "basing on working-class and peasant women," and achieved results, which is good, and should continue to be deepened in the future. However, many local women's federations have not done enough in uniting petty-bourgeois women, national bourgeois women, and all other patriotic and democratic women, and in striving for the middle and backward elements of each stratum or type of women. Some cadres even seriously have a closed-doorist tendency in their thinking, which must be thoroughly corrected in the future.

In order to consolidate this unity, it is necessary to expand and establish women's mass organizations that are adapted to it. The Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the All-China Women's Federation in September last year clearly stipulated that the women's representative conference is the best organizational form for contacting the vast number of women's masses, and is the best way to promote work, and issued the organizational rules for the women's representative conference. It has been proved many times in the land reform and production movements in various places, and it has been proved once again in the recent movement to resist America and aid Korea that using this organization can unite the vast majority of women. Therefore, we require the women's federations in all cities and rural areas where land reform has been implemented to formulate specific plans this year to universally establish and improve this organization. In areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, we will first select key points and try to establish them, gain experience, and prepare for universal implementation when land reform is implemented this winter. To this end, we hope that the leading cadres of the women's federations in various places, especially those above the provincial and municipal levels, will earnestly implement the organizational rules of the women's representative conference, personally start to create experience, and constantly explain the truth to their subordinates and introduce experience. In practical work, correct the various confused ideas that currently arise from the narrow closed-doorist tendencies in the cadres' minds, so that the organizational rules of the women's representative conference can be smoothly implemented.

In addition, in order to further adapt to the different requirements of various types of women, we can also mobilize women to participate in various existing women's organizations of different professions (such as the Nurses Association, Midwives Guild, etc.), and more can participate in various joint organizations of men and women, such as cooperatives, production groups, people's schools, literacy classes, reading clubs, research associations, etc., and cooperatives are the people's own economic organizations, which are closely related to the development of women's production and the improvement of women's lives, and should be mobilized in large numbers for women to participate. It is hoped that through various organizations, the women's masses with various different requirements will be organized separately, and at the same time, the organized mass foundation of the women's representative conference will be consolidated. As for the existing democratic women's groups in various places, they should consult with each other, divide labor appropriately, and develop together.

Finally, in order to carry out the above work well, our women's work cadres must be willing to work, regard women's work as their own cause, and in accordance with the spirit of the "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job" editorial published by Xinhua News Agency on "March 8" last year, go deep into the masses, study the business, proceed from the overall concept, establish the regular work and specialized business of the women's federation, and earnestly serve the women's masses. Let us firmly remember the inscription written by Chairman Mao in 1942 for the special issue of the Yan'an Liberation Daily on "March 8" International Women's Day: "Go deep into the masses and do not advocate empty talk," and truly implement it into practical action! In addition, we must boldly promote and use new cadres, open women's cadre training classes as much as possible, and appropriately train cadres. First, we must train the activists who have emerged from the mass movement and the female cadres from workers and peasants, absorb them to participate in women's work, increase the strength and fresh blood of our work, so as to jointly complete the arduous and heavy task of women's liberation.

　　在伟大爱国主义旗帜下进一步联系与教育广大妇女
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席　蔡畅
    当前中国妇女运动的中心的政治任务，是要继续发动全体妇女参加抗美援朝，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的运动，使妇女界的抗美援朝运动，能在全国范围内更加扩大和步步深入。对于已经发动妇女的地区，要继续展开，真正做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。对于尚未发动妇女或发动不够充分的地区（如广大农村及一部分城市），要迅即发动，要普遍扩大。不论上述那一种地区，均应特别注意吸收平时不关心政治或很少机会参加社会政治活动的妇女，争取全体妇女均能从自己的岗位上认识与参加伟大的爱国运动。
    其次，要把妇女界的抗美援朝运动与经常工作相结合，也就是与继续贯彻全国妇联第三次执委扩大会议的决议密切结合起来。过去的经验充分证明凡是平时注意妇女工作，做好妇女工作的地方，就容易广泛和深入地发动妇女参加抗美援朝运动；同样的，凡是此次深入进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育的地方，妇女群众的觉悟提高了，一切经常工作都能较好较快地完成；这样，既能使妇女群众的爱国热情变为实际行动，加强抗美援朝的实力，又能把妇女解放工作推进一步。这种做法是十分需要，而且完全可能的。例如三次执委扩大会议提出“城市妇女运动以生产为中心任务的方针要进一步与实际结合”的原则，在这次抗美援朝运动中的确得到了进一步的实现。工作做得好的地方，很多女工积极参加了爱国主义生产竞赛，生产效率提高了一步。不少职工家属改进了家务，来协助自己的丈夫、子女参加生产竞赛，大批家庭劳动妇女亦能踊跃参加絮行工作，既帮助了前线将士缝制大批军衣被服，又补助了家庭生活，提高了社会地位，建立了自己的组织，涌现了不少新的积极分子。这样使各阶层、各种职业的妇女、甚至家庭妇女群众，均有机会贡献自己的力量，参加伟大的爱国运动。再如，在这次运动中，有很多过去不大与闻政治或受美国帝国主义欺骗宣传较深的妇女，也积极参加了抗美援朝运动。不少爱国的母亲和妻子亲送自己的丈夫、子女参加志愿军和军事干部学校。再如教会学校的女学生、女教职员工及教职员工家属也热烈开展了控诉美帝暴行，反对奥斯汀诬蔑的运动。天主教、基督教、回教、佛教的女教徒也正在参加教会革新运动和爱国运动。所以这次伟大的爱国运动确实普遍到各阶层广大妇女，使妇女界的统一战线空前的扩大和巩固，使三次执委扩大会议提出的“更加强扩大各阶层妇女团结”的方针，加速实现。
    但是这一切，仅仅是良好的开端，运动的发展很不平衡，只有一部分大、中城市的妇女已经发动起来，配合着整个运动前进。就全国来讲，发动得还不够。就是已经发动起来的地方，也不够广泛深入，也未能充分地与经常工作相结合。针对这种情况，今后要继续扩大和深入妇女界的抗美援朝运动，要与继续贯彻全国妇联三次执委扩大会议的决议相结合，必须注意下列三点：
    第一，要在扩大和深入整个抗美援朝运动中，动员各种妇女群众搞好生产，做好工作，就必须在可能范围内逐步解决妇女的特殊困难，保护妇女切身利益，为妇女服务；只有照顾妇女的这种特殊实际情况才能发动最大多数妇女，提高妇女生产和工作的积极性。在这次抗美援朝运动中，有些地方创造了很好的经验，例如沈阳橡胶七厂，在去年十一月展开爱国主义生产竞赛时，女工的表现一般不及男工，十月份全体职工出勤率是百分之九十五，女工出勤率是百分之八十一·五，而女工数量在全厂职工中占三分之一以上，如果女工的积极性不提高，就会大大影响全厂的爱国主义生产竞赛。于是工会召开了各种大、小的女工会议，深入教育，打通思想，很多女工的积极性提高了，自愿订定出勤率到百分之百。但是结果，为了保证出勤率，有个别女工月经来后仍紧张工作，出血过多而病倒，有个别做母亲的女工，不按时给小孩喂奶，损害了孩子健康，影响了夫妇关系，有些女工坚持不下去，暗暗地修改了生产计划。厂方行政当局和工会看到这种情况，就深入了解和初步解决女工的特殊困难，具体规定下列四点办法：（一）女工给小孩喂奶时间不放在定额内。（二）产假不包括在病假事假内。（三）对身体弱的女工，按身体情况订立生产计划。（四）工会要注意了解女工思想情况，抓紧说服教育。因此，十一月份开始的十天，女工的出勤率提高到百分之九十四，仅比男工低百分之一，连当母亲的女工也能参加竞赛抢红旗了，全厂爱国主义生产大大提高了一步（引自沈阳橡胶七厂通讯员毕光同志的报道）。还有些城市妇联为着动员母亲们参加抗美援朝的会议，在举行会议时创办了临时托儿站，很好地安置孩子，使母亲们安心开会。在农村工作中，也有同样的经验。山西省妇联在总结一九五○年发动农村妇女参加春耕生产时，当时有些干部简单地认为“把妇女弄到地里就是‘发动’，参加了生产就能‘解放’，而不照顾家庭利益，不解决妇女特殊问题，因此不但妇女生产情绪不高，连男农民也反对”，沁县就进行了深入的检查，发现“好多地区妇女不上地是因为家庭不和，婚姻不满，开始干部怕‘天下大乱，不愿解决’，后经说服，干部帮助妇女分别情况具体解决后，妇女生产情绪高起来了。还有些妇女因小孩牵累不能上地生产，经互助组中老人变工看孩子，并提出妇女按时奶小孩与提前回家做饭等办法，解决了因家事连累不能上地的困难……保证了生产计划的实现”。这样做的结果，不仅妇女生产情绪提高，连男人也反映“要不是解放了妇女，那能和我们一起劳动”（引自一九五○年山西省妇联发动妇女参加春耕生产的总结报告）。
    过去，由于我们没有很好地反复地向大家说明这些道理，因此有些地区的妇联在决定工作时，只能一般地遵照人民政府提出的全体人民的总任务和上级民主妇联的决议，这是好的。在上下一致，集中全体男女人民的力量完成当前的中心工作方面是有一定作用的。但是另一方面，如何把全面的任务与妇女的切身利益，日常困难联系起来，担负起我们妇女团体保护妇女利益的天然职责来说，一般地是做得不够。在发动妇女完成全体人民的及与妇女解放的长远利益有关的任务时，没有完全的深刻的懂得如何从妇女群众的实际情况出发。因此，大大限制了我们发动妇女的广度和深度，甚至造成某些脱离群众的现象。
    我们希望各地妇联切实注意纠正这一个缺点；同时更要求人民政府及有关各方面能够尽可能支持和批准保护妇女特殊利益的必要措施，给与各种有力的帮助。
    第二，经常注意向妇女群众进行宣传教育工作，这是提高妇女政治文化水平，使妇女能和男子一样并肩参加各种工作的先决条件，又是妇女团体的应有的责任。事情很明白，因为旧社会长期束缚，一般妇女比男子落后，需要加一把劲进行教育；而且我们妇联是妇女群众自己的团体，必须用说服教育的方法来领导和推动工作，更应重视宣传教育工作。过去有些妇联对宣教工作注意不够，或把它当作临时工作的看法，应予纠正。当前宣传教育的中心内容有下列三点：（甲）经常地进行反对美国帝国主义，提倡爱国主义和国际主义的教育，把美国帝国主义在中国妇女中的影响彻底的全部连根铲除，提高民族自尊心，肃清民族自卑观念，激发爱人民爱祖国的热情。（乙）宣传中央和地方人民政府的政策法令，使妇女群众了解人民政府正在办什么事？怎样办？和妇女有什么关系，启发妇女群众遵守法令执行政策的自觉心。（丙）经常用具体事实真人真事宣传男女平等的政策思想，特别是当地妇联的工作方针和具体任务，以提高妇女自觉地参加妇女工作和自己的组织。
    进行宣传教育的方法，必须从妇女群众的亲身经验出发，逐步提高，才能增强教育效率。其次要运用群众所喜闻乐见的各种各样的宣传方式，特别是妇女群众所爱好的艺术形式，更能使教育内容深入人心。最后要着重指出宣传教育工作是属于思想范畴的工作，必须从妇女的实际情况出发，经过长期不疲倦的努力，经常有系统地进行，才能获得一定的成效；因此我们各级妇联应该学习中共中央发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众宣传网的决定”，培养女宣传员，并供给男女宣传员有关妇女儿童的宣传材料，依靠这批男女宣传员经常向妇女群众做宣教工作。其次我们应该学习中央人民政府政务院颁布的职工业余教育、农民业余教育的决定，协助政府，发动妇女参加职工业余学校、民校、识字班、冬学等等，以加强对女工、农妇及一切文化水平低的妇女的教育工作。此外，并应适当争取各种职业、技术训练班、干部学校中，能包含一定数量的妇女。为此各级妇联应有计划地帮助宣教部门建立经常的业务，改进工作方法，加强工作效能，并推动有关的机关团体注意向妇女群众进行宣传教育工作。
    第三，团结全体爱国民主妇女，扩大妇女群众的组织。去年九月全国妇联三次执委扩大会议中曾经明确规定了“从中华全国民主妇女联合会起到各地各级民主妇女联合会，都是在工人阶级领导下，以工农劳动妇女为基础，团结小资产阶级妇女、民族资产阶级妇女及一切爱国民主妇女的最广泛的统一战线组织”，不仅如此，而且我们民主妇联本身是民主妇女群众的组织，更应注意团结各民主阶层、各民主党派、各民族和各种宗教信仰的妇女，其中不仅要包含各行各业的妇女，还要吸收为数颇多的家庭妇女，以达到全体爱国民主妇女的大团结。而且对任何一个阶层或任何一界的妇女，都不仅应该吸收其中的进步分子，尤应团结中间分子，争取落后分子，只有这样才能更广泛地组织妇女，才能使我们的团体成为名符其实的广大的民主妇女的群众组织。过去大部分地方妇联在进行城、乡妇女工作时，一般能坚持贯彻以“工农妇女为基础”的方针，而且获得了成绩，这是好的，今后还要继续深入。但有不少的地方妇联在团结小资产阶级妇女、民族资产阶级妇女及其他一切爱国民主妇女方面，在争取每一阶层或每一类型的妇女的中间、落后分子方面，做得很不够，甚至有些干部思想中严重地存在着关门主义倾向，今后必须彻底纠正。
    为着巩固这种团结，必须扩大和建立与之相适应的妇女群众组织。去年九月全国妇联三次执委扩大会议中明确规定妇女代表会议是联系广大妇女群众的最好的组织形式，是推动工作的最好方式，并发布了妇女代表会议组织通则。在各地土改、生产运动中已经多少次证明了，在最近抗美援朝运动中，又一次证明了，运用这种组织，能够团结绝大多数妇女。因此我们要求各城市和已经实行土地改革的农村的妇联，今年能订出具体计划，普遍建立和健全这种组织。在尚未实行土地改革的地区，现在先行选择重点，试行建立，取得经验，准备今冬实行土地改革时普遍推行。为此，我们希望各地妇联，首先是省、市以上妇联的领导干部认真地执行妇女代表会议组织通则，亲自下手创造经验，并不断地向所属干部说明道理，介绍经验，在实际工作中纠正目前干部思想中由狭隘关门倾向出发而产生的种种糊涂思想，以便妇女代表会议组织通则顺利地执行。
    此外，为了更进一步适应各种各样妇女不同的要求，又可以动员妇女参加原有的各种不同职业的妇女组织（如护士协会、助产士公会等），更可参加各种男女群众的共同组织，如合作社、生产组、民校、识字班、读书会、研究会等，而合作社是人民群众自己的经济组织，与发展妇女生产，改善妇女生活有密切关系，更应大量动员妇女参加。希望经过各种各样的组织，把各种不同要求的妇女群众分别组织起来，同时也就能巩固妇女代表会议的有组织的群众基础。至于各地现有的民主妇女团体，则应互相协商，适当分工，共同发展。
    最后为着要很好地进行上述工作，我们妇女工作干部，必须安心工作，把妇女工作当作自己的事业，根据去年“三八”节新华社发布的“学会本领做好工作”社论的精神，深入群众，钻研业务，从整体观念出发，建立妇联的经常工作和专门业务，切实为妇女群众服务。让我们牢牢地记着毛主席一九四二年为延安解放日报“三八”国际妇女节特刊的题词：“深入群众，不尚空谈”，并真正地贯彻到实际行动中去！此外，更要大胆提拔和使用新干部，尽可能开设妇女干部训练班，适当地训练干部，首先要训练群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子和工农出身的女干部，吸收她们参加妇女工作，增加我们的工作的力量和新鲜的血液，以便共同完成艰巨而繁重的妇女解放任务。
