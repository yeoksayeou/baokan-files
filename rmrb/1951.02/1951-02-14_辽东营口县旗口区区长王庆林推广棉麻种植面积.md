To the Editor:

　　Comrade Wang Qinglin, head of Qikou District, Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, is very concerned about the interests of the masses. Last year, he achieved remarkable results in promoting the planting of cotton and hemp. In the past, only two villages in the eastern part of the entire Qikou District's seventeen administrative villages had planted a small amount of cotton, and most farmers had no experience or confidence in growing cotton. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, farmers were forced to plant some hemp, but because the puppet government forced them to purchase it at low prices, farmers generally believed that "whoever plants hemp will be impoverished," so they also lacked confidence. After Comrade Wang Qinglin understood these situations, he patiently persuaded and systematically cultivated model laborers to promote the planting of cotton and hemp. In 1949, Qikou District did not have a single mu of hemp. In 1950, 310 mu were planted. In 1949, the district planted 130 mu of cotton, but in 1950, it developed to 1,300 mu.

　　Comrade Wang Qinglin also often personally helped the masses. Su Youlan, a model laborer in Yaotun Village, Wen Shuqin, a farmer in Changtun Village, and Li Shengchang, a farmer in Waifangshen Village, all agreed to plant cotton, but could not buy seeds. Comrade Wang Qinglin personally helped them buy cotton seeds. Last year, cotton in the district suffered from seedling shortage due to wilt disease. Comrade Wang Qinglin helped farmers come up with remedial measures.

　　Li Naigong, the deputy village chief of Gejiabao Village, planted 6.2 mu of hemp after being mobilized by District Chief Wang, and received a lot of concrete help from Comrade Wang Qinglin from spring plowing to autumn harvest. As a result, the hemp grew very well. More than six mu of land produced a total of 700 jin of hemp fiber and 1,000 jin of hemp seeds, which could be exchanged for 25 shi of grain. Huang Haibo, a farmer in Yanglitun, planted four mu of wasteland with hemp after being persuaded by Comrade Wang Qinglin, and also harvested 300 jin of bast fiber and 350 jin of hemp seeds.

　　The masses learned a lot of production experience from District Chief Wang and benefited greatly. Farmers often gratefully said, "District Chief Wang really knows how to make plans for us ordinary people."

　　辽东营口县旗口区区长王庆林
　　推广棉麻种植面积
    编辑同志：
    辽东省营口县旗口区区长王庆林同志，很关心群众利益，去年在宣传推广种植棉麻工作上获得了显著的成绩。全旗口区十七个行政村，过去仅有东部两个村种过很少的棉花，一般农民都没有种棉经验和信心。伪满统治时期农民虽曾被强迫种过一些麻，但是，因为伪政府强迫以低价收购，农民普遍认为“谁种了麻谁就要受穷”，因而也没有信心。王庆林区长了解了这些情况以后，他就耐心的说服和有计划的培养劳动模范来推广棉麻的种植。一九四九年旗口全区一亩麻也没有，一九五○年种了三百一十亩。一九四九年全区种棉一百三十亩，一九五○年却发展到一千三百亩。
    王庆林同志还常常亲手去帮助群众。腰屯村劳动模范苏有兰、长屯村农民温淑琴、外房身村农民李盛昌，都同意种棉，但买不到种子，王庆林同志就亲自帮他们买来了棉种。去年该区棉花曾因枯死病而缺苗，王庆林同志帮助农民想出补救办法。
    葛家堡村副村长李乃功，经王区长的动员，种了六亩二分地的麻，并且在春耕到秋收之中得到王庆林同志的很多的具体帮助，因此，麻长得很好，六亩多地共剥麻七百斤，出麻子一千斤，折成钱可买粮二十五石。杨李屯农民黄海波经王庆林同志的劝说，把四亩荒地种上了麻，也收了皮麻三百斤，麻籽三百五十斤。
    群众跟王区长学会了很多生产经验，得到了很大利益。农民们常感激地说：“王区长真能为咱老百姓打主意。”
