Preparing to Carry Out Property Revaluation and Capital Adjustment Work
	Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Holds Mobilization Conference

[Report from this newspaper] The work of property revaluation and capital adjustment for private enterprises in Beijing is scheduled to officially commence after the Spring Festival. The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a publicity and mobilization conference on the afternoon of February 1st for the heads of various trade associations in the city, with approximately 500 people in attendance.

At the meeting, Peng Cheng, Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, pointed out that the purpose of the property revaluation and capital adjustment work is to overcome the shortcomings of private industry and commerce, improve management, and enable private enterprises to further develop in a more planned way on the existing basis. He also stated that this is a new and challenging task, a major event for industrialists and businessmen themselves, and that everyone must first conduct in-depth publicity, mobilization, and explanation work to eliminate unnecessary concerns and work together to do this work well. Ma Yingzhong, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, pointed out in his speech that one of the goals of the property revaluation and capital adjustment work is to strive for a more fair and reasonable burden on industrialists and businessmen, but this does not equate to increasing the burden on industrialists and businessmen. The income tax for 1950 will still be carried out according to established methods, and the increased value from this property revaluation will not be taxed. In the future, the collection of industrial and commercial taxes will be based on tax laws and will still be based on the size of turnover and income, calculated according to the rate.

At the meeting, Vice Chairman Liu Yifeng also announced that "Sub-committees of the Private Enterprise Property Revaluation Review Committee" will soon be established in various districts of Beijing. (Yang Guang)

　　准备开展重估财产调整资本工作
    京工商联举行宣传动员大会
    【本报讯】京市私营企业重估财产调整资本的工作，即将在春节后正式展开。京市工商联合会筹备委员会特于本月一日下午召集全市各同业公会负责人，举行宣传动员大会，到会约共五百人。
    会上京市人民政府工商局彭城局长指出重估财产调整资本这一工作是为了克服私营工商业的缺点，改进经营，使私营企业在现有基础上进一步更有计划的发展。并说：这是一个新的艰难的工作，是工商业家本身的大事，大家必须首先做深入的宣传、动员、解释工作，消除不必要的顾虑，群策群力，做好这一工作。京市税务局马应中副局长在讲话中指出：力求工商业者负担能进一步公平合理是重估财产调整资本这一工作的目的之一，但这决不等于增加工商业者的负担。一九五○年的所得税仍按既定办法进行，至于这次重估财产增值部分，决不征税。今后工商业税的征收，有税法，还是根据营业额和所得额的大小，依率计征。
    会上刘一峰副主委并宣布：京市各区即将成立“私营企业财产重估评审委员会分会”。（杨光）
