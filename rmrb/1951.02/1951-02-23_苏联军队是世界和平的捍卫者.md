　　Today, the Chinese people and all progressive people around the world are celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army with warmth and excitement, together with the Soviet people. This is because: the strength of the Soviet Army is not only conducive to the consolidation of the Soviet Union, but also to the safety of the people of all countries and to world peace.
　　When the Soviet Army was still very young, it thoroughly crushed the intervention troops of fourteen capitalist countries, including Britain, France, Japan, and the United States, which had absolute superiority in equipment and numbers, and their supported bandits such as Denikin, Kolchak, and Krasnov, in the difficult years of the domestic war and foreign military intervention. This stage of the battle paved the way for the world's peace fortress – the Soviet Union – to embark on the road of peaceful construction.
　　The Soviet Army's greatest contribution to all mankind was the victory in the Anti-Fascist War. When Nazi Germany treacherously invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 with all its strength and the power of its European vassals, people all over the world were worried about the Soviet Union. However, under the leadership of the great and talented commander Stalin, the Soviet Army, after four years of bloody battle, finally completely annihilated ten million of the most elite Nazi troops and their vassal armies in the capitalist world, recovered all the occupied territories, and liberated the people of Southeast Europe who had been ravaged by the Hitler bandits. After crushing the military forces of Fascist Germany, the Soviet Army turned eastward and annihilated the elite of Japanese imperialism - the Kwantung Army, liberated Northeast China, forced the Japanese invaders to surrender, and ended World War II. The defeat of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists dealt a devastating blow to the imperialist forces, thereby putting the forces of the peace and democracy camp in an advantageous position.
　　The Soviet Army has been praised by the working people all over the world for these outstanding achievements, and at the same time, it has been envied by the imperialist warmongers and their accomplices.
　　What is the source of the Soviet Army's power?
　　The source of the Soviet Army's power lies in the three characteristics pointed out by Stalin that fundamentally distinguish it from the bourgeois army. In his speech at the All-Moscow Soviet Meeting held in 1928 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Red Army, Stalin pointed out: "The first and basic characteristic of our Red Army is that it is an army of liberated workers and peasants, it is an army of the October Revolution, it is an army of the dictatorship of the proletariat." "The second characteristic of our Red Army is that it is an army of close unity of all nationalities in our country, an army that has liberated all previously oppressed nationalities, and an army that protects the freedom and independence of all nationalities in our country." "Finally, regarding the third characteristic of the Red Army. This third characteristic lies in the spirit of internationalism, in the internationalist sentiment that permeates our entire Red Army." Because of these characteristics, the Soviet Army produced mass revolutionary heroism and the spirit of overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and it produced a great spirit of discipline and self-sacrifice.
　　The path taken by the Soviet Army is precisely the path taken by the liberator of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Since its birth, under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gone through the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, defeating Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army supported by US imperialism, overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and establishing the People's Republic of China. The glorious fighting history of the Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army has proved that an army that fights for the people and is supported and supported by the people is invincible. The great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in defeating US imperialism on the Korean battlefield has once again proved this truth.
　　The Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are linked in a common struggle by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The purpose of this struggle is to defend world peace and prevent the re-aggression of Japanese aggressors and their collaborators. Imperialist warmongers, in order to prepare for new wars of aggression, are slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, attempting to use this deceptive means to drag the masses of people under their rule onto the road of war. However, the warmongers must not forget that on the road to their planned new war stands the powerful and invincible Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The solid alliance of the Soviet Army, which defeated the German and Japanese fascist armies, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army supported by US imperialism, is an absolutely invincible force. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out last year during the celebration of the Soviet Army Day: "The great Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have already stood hand in hand on the forefront of defending peace in the Far East and world peace. If the imperialists dare to launch a new war today to undermine world peace, then they will encounter a fate of more rapid and complete defeat than the German and Japanese fascists."
　　In celebrating the Soviet Army Day, the Chinese people should love and support the great Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army even more, should further strengthen the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and the Soviet Union, and should earnestly learn from the rich experience of the Soviet Army to strengthen our country's military strength, and to jointly defend peace in the Far East and the world.

### 苏联军队是世界和平的捍卫者

　　苏联军队是世界和平的捍卫者
    今天，中国人民和全世界进步人民都正以热烈兴奋的心情，与苏联人民一道庆贺苏联军队建军三十三周年纪念。这是因为：苏联军队的强大，不但有利于苏联的巩固，而且有利于各国人民的安全，有利于世界和平。
    当苏军还很年青的时候，它即在国内战争和外国军事干涉的艰难的岁月里，彻底粉碎了装备和数量上占绝对优势的英、法、日、美等十四个资本主义国家的干涉军队，和他们所支持的邓尼金、高尔察克、克拉斯诺夫等匪徒。这一阶段的战斗，为全世界的和平堡垒——苏联铺平了走上和平建设的道路。
    苏军对于全世界人类最伟大的贡献，是反法西斯战争的胜利。当一九四一年德国法西斯挟其全力及其欧洲附庸国的力量背信弃义向苏联侵犯时，全世界人民都曾为苏联担忧。但是，苏军在伟大的天才统帅斯大林的领导下，经过了四年的血战，终于彻底消灭了资本主义世界中最精锐的纳粹军队及其附庸军一千万人，收复了全部被侵占的国土，并解放了希特勒匪徒蹂躏下的东南欧人民。在粉碎了法西斯德国的军事力量后，苏联军队又挥戈东向，一举歼灭了日本帝国主义的精锐——关东军，解放了我国的东北，迫使日寇投降，结束了第二次世界大战。德、日、意法西斯的失败，使帝国主义势力受到了毁灭性的打击，从而使和平民主阵营的力量处于优势。
    苏联军队由于这些卓绝的功勋，受到了全世界劳动人民的歌颂，同时也受到了帝国主义战争贩子及其帮凶们的嫉恨。
    什么是苏联军队威力的源泉呢？
    苏联军队的威力的源泉，在于苏联军队有斯大林所指出的根本区别于资产阶级军队的三个特点。斯大林于一九二八年在莫斯科苏维埃为纪念红军十周年而召集的全体会议上的演说中，指出：“我们的红军之第一个和基本的特点，就在于它是已获得解放的工农之军队，它是十月革命之军队，它是无产阶级专政之军队。”“我们的红军之第二个特点，就在于它是我国各民族亲密联合的军队，使我们以前各被压迫民族获得解放的军队，是保护我国各民族之自由和独立的军队。”“最后，关于红军之第三个特点。这第三个特点就在于国际主义精神，就在于浸透整个我们红军的国际主义情感。”由于这些特点，苏联军队就产生了群众性的革命英雄主义，和克服各种困难的精神，就产生了伟大的纪律性和自我牺牲的精神。
    苏联军队所走的道路，正是中国人民的解放者中国人民解放军所走的道路。中国人民解放军自诞生以来，在伟大的毛泽东主席的英明领导之下，经过了土地革命、抗日战争和解放战争，战胜了日本帝国主义、和美帝国主义所支持的蒋介石匪帮军队，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立了中华人民共和国。苏联军队和中国人民解放军的光荣战斗历史，都证明了为人民而战、为人民所拥护和支持的军队是不可战胜的。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上击败美帝国主义的伟大胜利，也再一次证明这一个真理。
    苏联军队和中国人民解放军是被中苏友好同盟互助条约联结在共同的斗争中的，这个斗争的目的，就是保卫世界和平，防止日本侵略者及其合作者的重新侵略。帝国主义的战争贩子们，为着准备新的侵略战争，正在诽谤苏联和中华人民共和国，企图依靠这种欺骗手段把他们统治下的人民群众拖上战争的道路。但是，战争贩子们不要忘记，在他们所计划的新战争的道路上，庄严地站着强大无敌的苏联军队和中国人民解放军。打败了德、日法西斯军队的苏联军队，和战胜了日本帝国主义以及美帝国主义所支持的蒋介石匪军的中国人民解放军的坚固的同盟，是一支绝对不可战胜的力量。朱德总司令在去年庆祝苏军节时即已指出：“伟大的苏联军和中国人民解放军已经手携手地站在保卫远东和平和世界和平的最前线上。如果帝国主义者今天竟敢发动一个新的战争来破坏世界和平，那末，他们就会遭遇到比德国和日本法西斯更快更彻底的惨败的命运。”
    在庆祝苏联建军节时，中国人民应该更加热爱和拥护伟大的苏联军队和中国人民解放军，应当进一步加强中苏两国人民和两国军队的友谊，应当认真学习苏联军队的丰富经验来加强我国的军事力量，来共同保卫远东和世界的和平。
