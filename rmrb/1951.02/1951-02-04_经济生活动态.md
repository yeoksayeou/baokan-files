　　Economic Life Dynamics
            Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory Establishes Contact Contracts
    In November of last year, the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, due to the lack of coordination between the work processes of various workshops, only completed twelve of the sixteen combing machines originally planned to be manufactured. In December, the factory leadership studied the crux of the problem, came up with a solution, and created workshop production contact contracts. First, the main workshop, the assembly workshop, signed a contact contract with the lathe workshop for the supply of combing machine parts in December, which proved effective. Subsequently, each workshop successively signed workshop production contact contracts. Upon inspection at the end of December, not only were two more combing machines produced than the original target of sixteen, but each workshop also completed its task five days ahead of schedule. This proves that the production contact contract system can guarantee the completion of specific tasks.
            North China Pottery Company Cement Factory Exceeds Task
    The cement factories under the North China Pottery Company of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry exceeded their 1950 production task by 27.47%. The annual output exceeded the total output of the four years of the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule before liberation by a considerable amount. Over the past year, the quality of cement in various factories has generally improved, especially the successful trial production of "air-entraining agents," which can not only overcome the erosion of seawater on concrete and the difficulties of winter construction but also increase the service life of cement projects. This makes a great contribution to the current port and water conservancy projects. Last year, the average production cost of each factory was reduced by 40% compared to the past.
            1.5 Million Mu of Low-lying Land Along the Ji Canal is Drained
    After the completion of the first year (1950) of the Chaobai New River project, the water level of the Ji Canal was greatly reduced. Of the more than 1.7 million mu of waterlogged low-lying land along the coast, more than 1.54 million mu have now been drained. It is expected that all of it can be sown before and after the spring plowing. At an average harvest of 100 jin of millet per mu, a total of 170 million jin of grain can be harvested.
            Shanghai Financial Industry Agricultural Loan Group to Expand
    Due to the government's call, last spring, 34 banks and firms in Shanghai formed the "Shanghai Financial Industry Agricultural Loan Group," raising over 2.16 billion RMB to provide loans for soybean cakes, vegetable cakes, and fertilizers in five counties near Shanghai. This new business is not only beneficial to agricultural production but also helps to alleviate the temporary difficulties after the "February 6th bombing." On January 24, the group held a meeting to summarize the experience of this loan release and decided to invite banks and firms throughout the city to participate and expand the amount of agricultural loans.
            Beijing's Third Lottery Savings to be Drawn Early
    The People's Bank of Beijing's third lottery savings began accepting deposits on January 21st. By January 31st, 250,000 tickets had been deposited, more than double the daily deposit amount of the first and second rounds. The bank estimates that the 400,000 lottery tickets for the third round can be fully deposited in advance. It has been decided that the third round of lottery tickets will also be drawn early. Those who plan to save should hurry up and save.
            Beijing Department Store to Reduce Prices for Three Days During Spring Festival
    In order to provide citizens with the opportunity to purchase New Year goods at low prices, the Beijing Department Store will reduce prices for three days from the 3rd to the 5th of this month. Retail companies have also decided to reduce prices to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, honorary servicemen, and servicemen.
