Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports that newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries widely published commentaries on the 18th and 19th, warmly supporting Stalin's talk with a Pravda reporter on the current international situation.

Stalin's talk has aroused enthusiastic reactions among the people of the German Democratic Republic. Many newspapers in Berlin published the full text of the talk. The headlines and commentaries of the newspapers unanimously pointed out the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy and the necessity of intensifying the defense of peace. The "Neues Deutschland" stated: "At a crucial moment when mankind is facing the urgency of war and peace, Stalin, the wise leader of international peace forces, delivered a talk, using clear and convincing language to explain where the threat of war lies and telling the people of all countries how to stop this threat. Stalin called on the people of all countries to defend the cause of maintaining peace to the end and to launch a broad peace movement as a tool to expose the evil conspiracies of warmongers. This call is mobilizing peace advocates all over the world, including Germany, to intensify the struggle for peace and to broadly help and support the World Peace Council in completing the great tasks it faces." The "Berliner Zeitung" stated: "Maintaining peace is the cause of every peace-loving person. Stalin's words put forward a clear program of action for friends of peace." "Nacht-Express" emphasized: "We will do everything in our power to consolidate the great international peace camp and explain to our people that if the plans of the warmongers are exposed and they are isolated, then peace can be guaranteed."

The Polish United Workers' Party organ, "Trybuna Ludu," published an editorial stating: "The voice of peace has sounded again in Moscow. Stalin, the highest moral authority of our time, has issued a statement, and every word of his is a fatal blow to the aggressors." The editorial pointed out that Stalin's remarks that peace can be maintained and consolidated if the people of all countries defend the cause of peace to the end place a great responsibility on the shoulders of all peace-loving people. The responsibility of the Polish people is to "intensify peaceful construction, increase vigilance against the destructive attempts of imperialism, strengthen the profound friendship and alliance between the people and the Soviet Union, consolidate the peace camp, and expose the attempts of warmongers to drive the people into war." "Głos Pracy" stated: "Stalin has once again expressed the firm belief that war is not inevitable at present, which is also the belief of the entire Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world. Stalin's talk encourages the Polish people to win the victory of peaceful labor and build our motherland as one of the strongholds of peace."

The Czechoslovak Communist Party organ, "Rudé Právo," published an editorial stating that the good people of all countries in the world applaud Comrade Stalin's talk with a Pravda reporter. Every word and every sentence of Stalin's reply clearly and firmly expressed the peace policy and peace wishes of the invincible socialist country, the Soviet Union, shattered the aggressive plans of the instigators of a new war, exposed their evil faces, and strengthened the determination of hundreds of millions of people to fight for peace. Stalin's words are a call to battle, calling on us to tighten the ranks of the strong peace camp, accelerate the construction of socialism in our country, and make our motherland a more solid link in the great people's front—a front that makes the evil plans of the warmongers impossible.

Hungarian newspapers all published editorials commenting on Stalin's talk. The Hungarian Workers' Party organ, "Szabad Nép," wrote: "The greatest friend and protector of ordinary people pointed out the most important issue in current world politics. Stalin's remarks that a new war is not inevitable at present provide every peace advocate with a guide and weapon to help them confidently find their way in the complex international situation and have an increasingly firm determination to repel the provocations of the warmongers. Stalin's statement has been met with the most enthusiastic response throughout Hungary. The Hungarian people pledge to work twice as hard for peace."

Romanian newspapers all published editorials commenting on Stalin's talk. The Romanian Workers' Party organ, "Scînteia," in an editorial entitled "The Cause of Peace is in the Hands of the People," stated: Stalin's answer confirmed the righteousness of the cause of peace, fully exposed the aggressive conspiracy of the imperialists. The victory of the world-scale peace movement confirmed that there is a deep truth in Stalin's answer. Even the imperialists understand this, and they have encountered increasingly strong resistance from the people who do not want war. The editorial concluded: All the Romanian people will follow Stalin's instructions with confidence, because these instructions point out the path to peace. "România Liberă" stated: Stalin's answer calls on the people of all countries to tighten their ranks and wage a resolute struggle for peace. The working people must intensify their actions, unite all honest people in the world in the struggle for peace, and systematically and ruthlessly expose every new conspiracy of the imperialists—peace fighters should respond to the call of the great peace standard-bearer Stalin with these actions.

The Bulgarian Communist Party organ, "Rabotnichesko Delo," published an editorial stating: "The words of the great Stalin once again brilliantly illuminate the direct path to socialism, and give us infinite confidence, showing us that the noble struggle for peace and socialism will inevitably be victorious." "Otechestven Front" wrote: "Hundreds of millions of people around the world repeatedly read the great Stalin's answers to the questions raised by a Pravda reporter. Based on these answers, everyone can distinguish between truth and falsehood, and distinguish between truth and anti-Soviet slanderous propaganda. The people of all countries have enthusiastically responded to the call of the great Stalin. They know that whether war can be prevented and peace can be maintained depends on their efforts."

    【新华社十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国、波、捷、匈、罗、保等国报纸，在十八、十九日广泛发表评论，热烈拥护斯大林就目前国际形势对真理报记者发表的谈话。
    斯大林的谈话在德意志民主共和国人民中引起了热烈的反响。柏林的许多报纸都发表了谈话的全文，各报的标题和评论都一致指出苏联一贯的和平政策及加紧保卫和平的必要性。《新德意志报》称：“在人类面临着战争与和平的紧要时刻，国际和平力量的英明领袖斯大林发表了谈话，用明确而令人信服的语句说明战争的威胁在那里，并且告诉各国人民怎样去制止这一威胁。斯大林号召各国人民把维护和平的事业保卫到底，并发动广泛的和平运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具。这一号召正在动员全世界包括德国的和平拥护者加紧争取和平的斗争，广泛地帮助和支持世界和平理事会完成它面临的巨大任务。”《柏林日报》称：“维护和平乃是每个爱好和平的人们的事业。斯大林的话为和平的友人们提出了明确的行动纲领。”《每夜快报》强调称：“我们将竭尽一切力量来巩固伟大的国际和平阵营，并向我国人民解释：如果揭穿了战争贩子们的计划，使他们陷于孤立，那末和平就能得到保障。”
    波兰统一工人党机关报《人民论坛报》发表社论称：“莫斯科又响起了和平的声音。当代最高的道义权威斯大林发表了声明，他的每一句话都给侵略者以致命的打击。”社论指出：斯大林关于各国人民如把和平事业保卫到底，和平就能保持巩固的言论，使很大的责任落在一切爱好和平人民的肩上。波兰人民的责任就是“加紧进行和平建设，提高对帝国主义的破坏企图的警惕，加强人民对苏联的深厚友谊和同盟的联系，巩固和平阵营，并揭露战争贩子把人民驱入战争的企图。”《劳动之声》报称：“斯大林又一次表示确信战争在目前不是不可避免的坚定信念，这也是全苏联人民和全世界爱好和平人民的信念。斯大林的谈话鼓舞了波兰人民去赢取和平劳动的胜利，并建设作为和平堡垒之一的我们的祖国。”
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报《红色权利》报发表社论称：全世界各国的善良人民都欢呼斯大林同志对真理报记者的谈话。斯大林回答的每一个字和每一句话，明确而坚定地表示了不可战胜的社会主义国家苏联的和平政策与和平愿望，粉碎了新战争挑拨者的侵略计划，揭露了他们的罪恶面目，并使亿万人民加强了为和平而斗争的决心。斯大林的话是战斗的号召，号召我们紧密强大的和平阵营的队伍，加速在我国建设社会主义，使我们的祖国成为伟大的人民阵线——使战争贩子们的罪恶计划不可能实现的阵线中的更加坚固的一环。
    匈牙利各报均发表了评论斯大林谈话的社论。匈牙利工人党机关报《自由人民》报写道：“普通人民最伟大的朋友和保护者，指出了当前世界政治中最重大的问题。斯大林认为在目前新战争不是不可避免的言论，给每个和平拥护者提供了指针和武器，帮助他们有信心地在复杂的国际局势中找出道路，并具有日益坚强的决心来击退战争贩子的挑衅。斯大林的声明在匈牙利全国各地得到了最热烈的响应。匈牙利人民保证要为和平而加倍努力工作。”
    罗马尼亚各报均发表社论评论斯大林的谈话。罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》在题为《和平事业掌握在人民手中》的社论中称：斯大林的回答证实了和平事业的正义性，充分地揭露了帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。全世界规模的和平运动的胜利证实了斯大林的回答中是有着深刻的真理的。就连帝国主义者也了解这一点，他们已遇到了不要战争的人民的越来越强烈的反抗。社论结语称：罗马尼亚全体人民将满怀信心地遵照斯大林的指示，因为这些指示指出了达到和平的道路。《自由罗马尼亚报》称：斯大林的回答号召着各国人民紧密他们的队伍，为和平而进行坚决的斗争。劳动人民更加加紧行动，把全世界一切正直人民团结到争取和平的斗争中来，有系统并且无情地揭露帝国主义者的每个新阴谋——和平战士应当以这些行动来响应伟大的和平旗手斯大林的号召。
    保加利亚共产党机关报《工人事业》报发表社论称：“伟大斯大林的话再次辉煌地照明了通往社会主义的直接的道路，并且给了我们无限的信心，昭示我们为了和平和社会主义的崇高的斗争必然胜利。”《祖国阵线》报写道：“全世界的亿万人民把伟大斯大林对真理报记者所提问题的答复反复阅读。根据这些答复，每一个人都可以识别真理与虚伪，把真理和反苏诽谤宣传区别开来。各国人民已经热烈地响应了伟大斯大林的号召。他们知道战争能否防止、和平能否维护，都取决于他们的努力。”
