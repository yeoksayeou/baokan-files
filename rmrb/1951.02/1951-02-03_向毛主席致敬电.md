　　To our most beloved Chairman Mao:
    Under your wise leadership, light shines upon all of China. The long-oppressed Chinese people and all Asian people have basked in your great and brilliant glory and have been reborn. But the ugly American imperialists are madly unleashing their poisonous flames, attempting to strangle the lives of peaceful people, launching a war of aggression against Korea, and occupying our territory of Taiwan. The American imperialists are precisely the Asura demons spoken of in Buddhism. According to our Buddhist doctrine of compassion and peace, their existence is absolutely intolerable. We must resolutely overthrow them. Since the liberation of Beijing, all of us, both ordained and lay Buddhist followers, have learned new revolutionary knowledge. Based on the Buddhist concept of the Dharmadhatu's ideology of protecting the country and patriotism combined with internationalism, we have all acted in unison in the current movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
    Today, thousands of Buddhists in our people's capital are holding a patriotic demonstration parade to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the American rearmament of Japan. We, all four groups of followers, solemnly swear to you: We will, under your leadership, intensify our studies, raise our political awareness, participate in production, and work hard. We will abide by the teachings, strive for lasting peace, and oppose wars of aggression. We will fight to the end against the American imperialists, the mortal enemy of the people, with great courage and fearlessness. All of these aspirations are born from your great enlightenment.
    All glory to our beloved and great leader.
    Long live Chairman Mao! With utmost respect,
    Beijing Buddhist Community's Patriotic Demonstration Parade to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Oppose American Rearmament of Japan
                                              February 2nd

　　向毛主席致敬电
    我们最敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的英明领导下，光明普照了全中国，久受压迫的中国人民和全亚洲人民都沐到了您伟大灿烂的光辉，得到了新生。但丑恶的美帝国主义者却疯狂地施放毒焰，妄想扼杀和平人民的生命，发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，并侵占我领土台湾。美帝正是佛教所说的阿修罗恶魔，在我们主张慈爱和平的佛教教义上是绝对不能容许其存在的，我们要坚决打倒它。自从北京解放以来，我们全体出家和在家的四众佛教徒们，都已学习了新的革命知识。我们基于佛教法界观的护国思想和与国际主义相结合的爱国主义，在当前抗美援朝保家卫国运动中都一致行动起来了。
    今天我们人民首都的数千佛教徒在这里举行抗美援朝、反对美帝武装日本的爱国示威游行大会，我们全体四众谨向您庄严的宣誓：我们要在您的领导下，加紧学习，提高我们的政治认识，参加生产，努力劳动；我们要秉照教义，争取持久和平反对侵略战争；我们要以大勇无畏的精神与人民的死敌美国帝国主义斗争到底。这一切的志愿都是由于您伟大的启示而产生的。
    一切光荣归于我们敬爱的伟大领袖。
    毛主席万岁！谨致崇高的敬礼
    北京市佛教界抗美援朝反对美国武装日本爱国示威游行大会
                                              二月二日
