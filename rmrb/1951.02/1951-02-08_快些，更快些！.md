　　"Faster, Faster!"
　　By Our Correspondent Tian Liu
　　In Korea, work at night is intense and hurried. While enemy planes can still run rampant in the people's skies, all work must be carried out at night.

　　On every road, crowds supporting the war shuttle back and forth: trucks speed along the highways, trains roar towards the front, stretcher teams rescue the wounded from the front lines and rush them to the rear for treatment, and volunteer engineering brigades repair the roads and bridges destroyed by the retreating enemy. In parking lots and secret warehouses, laborers are busy loading, unloading, and concealing supplies—everyone focused and dedicated to their work. Everywhere there is the "swish, swish" of marching feet and the roar of steel and motors. Everywhere one can hear the short, powerful shouts of mutual encouragement: "Faster, Faster!" The warriors who are fiercely attacking the American aggressors on the front lines send back messages saying, "As long as we have bullets in our guns and food in our bellies, we are sure to defeat the American aggressors!" The logistics department's soldiers, cadres, and laborers respond to the warriors at the front with "We guarantee the front-line troops have food to eat, bullets to fire, and prompt evacuation of the wounded." They have launched a heroic competition movement between individuals and units, and heroic deeds and model figures are emerging daily on the supply and transportation front, just like the warriors who bravely kill the enemy on the people's front line.

　　The Northeast automobile drivers organized the Fifth Volunteer Anti-American Aid Korea Automobile Transportation Brigade. Liu Huiming, the second squad leader, led six vehicles to transport ammunition to the front and just created a new record for round-trip driving, but it was surpassed by a newer record in just a few days. The Fourth Company of the First Automobile Transportation Brigade has maintained a very high collective night driving record since mid-December of last year. Shi Qingfu and Cao Shuhou of the Medical Administration Department overturned their cart a few days ago while transporting clothes, blankets, and medicine to the front with a horse-drawn cart. All the supplies on the cart fell into the river. Regardless of the cold, the two comrades immediately jumped into the icy river to rescue all the items; when the laborers were loading and unloading the carts, they put forward the slogan of "load quickly, unload quickly, transport quickly" and quickly completed their tasks. Initially, because they lacked experience, everyone rushed to load and unload the carts, often hindering each other and delaying the time due to too many people. After a period of work, everyone gradually became familiar with the process and came up with many good ideas. Now, before each task, they first understand what is being loaded or unloaded, how many people are going, who opens the car door, who gets in the car to unload things, how many people stay under the car to receive things, and who goes first and who goes later are all arranged in advance, so the loading and unloading time is greatly shortened. Before the start of the Third Battle for the Liberation of Seoul, a huge transportation effort was launched on the supply line to ensure the complete victory of the battle. Once, a very large transportation team was carrying ammunition to the front lines. In the middle of the journey, a river more than four zhang (about 13 meters) wide stood in the way. Because there were too many vehicles and the load was too heavy, the ice on the river was crushed, and countless vehicles were blocked on this side of the river and could not move forward. At this time, the Dehui County Labor Team, which was performing a task to the front, also arrived here and immediately and voluntarily took on the task of building a bridge. At this time, it was snowing heavily, and a bone-chilling wind was blowing. But it was necessary to raise the banks of the river to build a bridge. The banks of the river were frozen as hard as stone, and without tools, how could the frozen soil be moved? Without soil and stone, what could be used to raise the riverbanks? In the end, the squad leader walked to the center of the river and jumped into the river from the broken ice hole. He bent down, touched the bottom of the river, and found it was stone and sand. He first lifted a large stone and placed it on the ice. Seeing this, team member Kang Zhibin also hurriedly jumped into the water to dig sand upwards. More than 20 team members jumped into the water one after another, and before long, they built the bridge. The laborers stood at the head of the bridge, applauding and cheering as trucks and carts loaded with supplies sped across the bridge they had built with their own hands. None of the laborers noticed that their soaked cotton pants and sleeves had been frozen into inflexible ice tubes by the December wind, and their waterlogged shoes were frozen to the cold ground, unable to move.

　　The other day, I interviewed Comrade Liang Chen, a model laborer from Dehui County. Recently, he received an award from the logistics department for his outstanding work achievements. I asked him, "Why did you insist on transporting supplies when you injured your leg so badly while unloading the car the other day, until you were about to faint before everyone forced you to go back and rest?" He replied, "Comrade, if you look at my life, you will know why." Old Liang worked as a long-term laborer for landlords since he was a child and was a laborer during the puppet Manchukuo era. He tasted all kinds of hardships. When talking about the past, Old Liang shed tears more than once. After liberation, he was allocated four qing (about 2.7 hectares) of land and three houses. His life became better and better day by day. "Tell me," Old Liang asked me, "if I don't work hard enough, do I still want to be a long-term laborer for the landlord! Do I still want to be a laborer for American imperialism!" Therefore, although he is already 57 years old this year, he insisted on going abroad to resist America and aid Korea. He was afraid that others would think he was too old and would not let him go, so he only reported 45 years old when he signed up.

　　After going abroad, the laborers witnessed the atrocities of the American and Li gangs, which further increased their hatred and anger towards the enemy. The American and Li gangs' slaughter, bombing, and rape of the Korean people when they invaded the Yalu River were already infuriating, but when the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army drove the bandits out of Pyongyang, the enemy saw that its final defeat was irreparable and carried out even more brutal atrocities. In Hwanghae Province, the beasts not only burned down all the towns and villages and collectively raped many Korean women, but also carried out an unprecedented massacre, not even sparing some babies who were breastfeeding in their mothers' arms. Most of the volunteer laborers and stretcher teams who participated in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea were liberated farmers and workers from the Northeast. Seeing this tragic situation, they further recognized the American imperialists' policy towards peace-loving people and clearly understood how the reactionaries representing the interests of the landlords treated the liberated farmers. During breaks from their tasks, the laborers often discussed these unforgivable atrocities. The atrocities of the American imperialists enraged everyone in our volunteer forces, and the short and powerful cries of mutual encouragement, "Faster, Faster!" constantly rang out among the busy working crowd.

　　“快些，更快些！”
    本报记者  田流
    在朝鲜，夜晚的工作是紧张而匆忙的。在敌机还暂时能够在人民的天空肆虐时，所有一切的工作都要在夜间进行。
    条条道路上都往返奔忙着支援战争的人群：汽车在公路上飞驰，火车呼喊着钢铁的巨响驰往前方，担架队从火线上将伤员抢救下来急速的运到后方去治疗，志愿工程大队抢修着敌人溃退时破坏了的道路和桥梁。在停车场和秘密的仓库旁边，民工们正紧张的装卸和掩蔽物资——每个人都全神贯注、专心致志于自己的工作。到处是“擦擦”前进的脚步声和钢铁与马达的轰鸣。到处可以听到：“快些，更快些”的短促有力的互相激励的喊声。在火线上痛击着美国侵略军的勇士们，捎回信来说：“只要枪有弹，肚有饭，保险打垮美国侵略军！”后勤部门的战士、干部和民工们用“保证前方部队有饭吃，有弹打，迅速转运伤员”，回答前线的勇士们。他们展开了人与人、这个单位与那个单位的立功竞赛运动，英雄事迹和模范人物也像在人民前线英勇杀敌的勇士们一样，天天涌现在供给及运输战线上。
    东北汽车司机组织起来的志愿抗美援朝第五汽车运输大队，二小队长刘辉明同志，率领六台车运送弹药去前方，刚创造了往返行车的新纪录，不几天又被更新的纪录超过去了。第一汽车运输大队四中队，从去年十二月中旬起，一直保持着夜行极高的集体纪录。医管处石清福、曹述厚同志前几天用马车向前方运送衣、被和药品时翻了车，全车的物资都掉在河里，两同志不顾寒冷立时跳进冰冷的河里，把全部的东西抢救出来；民工们在装卸车的时候，提出“快装、快卸、快运”的口号，迅速的完成着任务。起初，因为没有经验，装卸车时大家都争先恐后，一涌齐上，常常因为人手过多，反倒碍手碍脚耽误了时间。经过一段时间的工作后，大家慢慢的熟习起来，想出了许多好办法。现在，每逢执行任务前，先了解装卸什么东西，多少人去，谁打开车门，谁上车往下卸东西，有多少人留在车下接运东西，谁先谁后，都事先安排停当，因此装卸时间大大缩短。解放汉城的第三次战役开始之前，在供应线上，为了保证战役的完全胜利，在战线的后方曾展开了巨大的运输活动。一次，一个非常庞大的运输队，运送弹药到前线去，中途，一条四丈多宽的大河横在运输线上，因为车辆过多，装载过重，河上的冰被压碎了，无数的车辆被阻在河的这岸不能前去。这时，德惠县民工队往前方执行任务，也走到这里，立时自动的担负起架桥的任务。这时，天正飘着大雪，刮着透骨的寒风，但又必须将河的两岸垫高，才能搭起桥来，河两岸冻得石头样硬，没有工具，又那能掀得动冻土？没有土、石又用什么垫起河岸？分队长最后走到河中央，从轧破的冰洞口跳下河去，弯下腰，一摸河底，恰是石砂，便首先掀起一块大石，放在冰上。队员康志宾一看也急忙跳下去往上挖砂子，二十多名队员都先后下水，没有多久，便把桥搭起来了。民工们站在桥头，鼓着掌欢送着满载物资的汽车、大车，从自己亲手筑成的桥上急驰而去。民工们谁也没有发觉，自己湿透了的棉裤和衣袖，已被十二月的寒风，吹冻成不能弯曲的冰筒，带水的鞋子冻结在冰冷的土地上，移动不得。
    日前，我访问了德惠县模范民工队员梁臣同志。最近，因为他卓越的工作成就，受到了后勤部的奖励。我问他：“为什么你在前天卸车时，把腿碰伤得那样厉害，还坚持运送物资，直到快要晕倒，才被大家硬拖回去休息？”他回答说：“同志，你看看我这一辈子，就知道为什么了。”老梁从小就给地主扛长工，伪满时代当劳工，什么苦都尝到了，和我谈起往事来，老梁还不止一次的流下泪来。解放后，他分到了四垧地，三间房，有吃有穿，日子一天比一天美起来。“你说，”老梁问我：“我再不使足劲干，莫非还想给地主扛长工！莫非我还再想作美帝国主义的劳工！”因此，他虽然今年已经五十七岁了，也非要出国来抗美援朝不可，他怕别人嫌他年岁大，不让他来，报名时只报了四十五岁。
    出国后，民工们目睹美李匪帮的暴行，更增加了对敌人的仇恨与愤怒。美李匪帮侵抵鸭绿江边时，对朝鲜人民的屠杀、轰炸与奸淫，已经令人怒不可遏，但当朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军，将匪徒们逐出平壤后，敌人看到它的最后失败已不可挽救时，进行了更加残酷的暴行。在黄海道，野兽们溃逃时，不仅烧毁了全部的城镇与乡村，集体奸淫了许多朝鲜妇女，而且进行了史无前例的大屠杀，连有的正在母亲怀里吃奶的婴儿也不能幸免。参加抗美援朝的志愿民工、担架队，大部分是东北的翻身农民和工人，看到这种惨状，进一步认识了美帝国主义对待爱好和平的人民的政策，万分清楚地认识了代表地主利益的反动派，怎样对待翻身农民。民工们在执行任务的间隙休息时，常常谈论着这些不可饶恕的暴行。美帝的暴行，激怒着我国志愿部队中的每一个人，在紧张劳作的人群中，不断响起“快些，更快些啊！”的短促而有力的相互鼓励声。
