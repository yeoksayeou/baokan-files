　　Thoughts After Seeing the Film "Steel Warrior"
　　Yuan Shui Pai

　　The film "Steel Warrior" is a film rich in educational significance and has been welcomed by audiences. It tells the audience that the victory of the revolution is by no means accidental. It illustrates how noble the revolutionary qualities of the people's heroes are. It encourages people to learn from these proletarian vanguards and outstanding Communist Party members. The film's ideological content is not expressed through dry arguments but through artistic expression to deeply move the audience.

　　"Steel Warrior" depicts the story of how the excellent soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, closely integrated with the people during the Liberation War, fought heroically, remained unyielding, and finally achieved victory. Company Commander Zhang leads a platoon to cover the transfer of a regiment. After completing the task, they are ordered to retreat, but they have already been surrounded by the enemy. Company Commander Zhang commands the entire platoon to fight fiercely for five days and nights, repelling countless enemy attacks, persisting to the very end. Local farmers relay intelligence and guide them to jump off a cliff to break through the encirclement, but unfortunately, they do not succeed. In a bayonet fight, most of the soldiers sacrifice heroically. Company Commander Zhang, the cook Old Wang, the young messenger Little Liu, and a wavering element are captured by the enemy. The enemy uses torture, enticements, the softening influence of sexual allurements, and other coercions, but all fail to make the soldiers reveal the location of the buried machinery and grain. Finally, the People's Liberation Army launches a counter-offensive, annihilates the enemy, liberates the area, rescues Company Commander Zhang from prison, and continues to advance victoriously.

　　Company Commander Zhang is one of the countless heroic and steadfast commanders and fighters in the People's Liberation Army. The playwright's choice of such a typical figure to express the theme is very appropriate. Like many soldiers, he is a soldier from a peasant background who suffered feudal oppression. Under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, he is tempered into a "Steel Warrior" who can withstand all tests. No matter how brutal and cunning the enemy is, they are helpless in the face of such a soldier who is loyal to the Party and loyal to the people. The high level of class consciousness and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers are fully embodied in Company Commander Zhang.

　　But Company Commander Zhang is by no means an isolated example, a solitary hero. The cook Old Wang and the messenger Little Liu are also shining typical figures of the People's Liberation Army. They are indomitable, unyielding in the face of danger, firm in their position, and clear about who are friends and who are enemies. In Little Liu's simple, clear, and powerful last words before sacrificing himself, it is "Carry the revolution through to the end." These two characters and their actions are particularly appealing to the audience. The screenwriter and director are clearly quite familiar with such typical figures, writing them effortlessly and with authenticity and intimacy. The actors' performances are also competent, without unnecessary exaggeration. The scene where the cook Old Wang exposes the wavering element's attempt to sow discord in prison is depicted with relative delicacy. The traitor's stupidity and the soldier's alertness are realistically portrayed. The originally mild eyes suddenly flashed with wisdom and hatred when he discovered the enemy's plot; the body that had been feigning exhaustion suddenly attacked the traitor like a tiger, shouting "Beat the counter-revolutionaries!" These treatments are wonderful.

　　The character of Little Liu is very lovable. The audience likes and respects this "little devil" very much. The scene where he deals with and outwits the enemy's political work section chief who interrogates him is fascinating. His answers to the special agent's questions, which are sometimes threatening and sometimes enticing, are so simple and forceful, and yet suited to a child's tone. For example, when the special agent asks him to reveal the location of the buried machinery and grain, he replies: "I won't say. If I say it, wouldn't I become a counter-revolutionary?" The author portrays him as a soldier who has received revolutionary training under the leadership of the Party, while also appropriately showing his naivety and liveliness. For example, in prison, he eats all the snacks sent by the enemy, saying that he can "have more strength," and after finishing, he smashes the plate to pieces. This kind of expression of character through action makes the character appear real and vivid. During the Liberation War, many young soldiers emerged, who were still young, but under the education of the Party and the army, became young soldiers with a relatively high level of political consciousness. They are loyal to the revolution and brave in battle, and are representatives of the revolutionary younger generation. The Soviet Union has Tanya and the youth of the Donbas mining region, and we also have many like the young messenger Liu Haiquan in the film. Our artists have a responsibility to create artistically complete typical figures especially for our youth.

　　Not only are there such "Steel Warriors" in the army, but there are also countless steel-like figures among the people. Company Commander Zhang's mother and many farmers who sheltered Company Commander Zhang after he escaped from prison are all such figures. The enemy wants to use the love between mother and son to shake Company Commander Zhang, but not only does our soldier not waver, but the mother's persuasion to surrender to her son, which the enemy expected, turns into revolutionary encouragement. When the audience sees the spirit of that old, yet strong, ordinary rural woman who regards death as home, they cannot help but be moved to tears. Such figures are typical of the new, awakened people, and also representatives of our nation's excellent traditions. Similarly, those farmers who would rather be shot than betray the People's Liberation Army also deeply move the audience. The film depicts the greatness of these ordinary people, and at the same time, it shows the close relationship between the army and the people. On the one hand, the villagers risk crossing the encirclement to deliver grain, ammunition, and intelligence to the army, and on the other hand, the army cares about whether the farmers in the village have suffered disasters even in extreme difficulties; on the one hand, the farmers would rather exchange their own lives for the lives of the soldiers, and on the other hand, the soldiers are unwilling to implicate the people and are willing to step forward and sacrifice themselves. These descriptions successfully express the idea of "the army and the people as one" and also explain the reason why the people's army is bound to win.

　　The plot of the film has twists and turns, and suspense, and the characterization is also specific and vivid, so the theme appears powerful, without falling into the rut of formalism. For example, the swearing-in ceremony on the position could easily become a pile of arguments and slogans. But the film is not like this. After Little Liu puts the image of Chairman Mao from his notebook on the rock, and the soldiers all raise their hands, this shot ends. Here, the technique appears very economical.

　　The film "Steel Warrior" maintains and also develops some of the advantages of the original stage play, but sometimes it is still somewhat constrained by the original work. The mountain top that the soldiers defended after repelling the enemy's several attacks does not appear in the film as a strategically important military stronghold. Some shots seem to be similar to the stage surface, without fully utilizing the superior conditions of the art of film. The authenticity of the lighting and set design is also not enough. In addition, the actor who plays Company Commander Zhang in the film, in the first few scenes, does not express the identity and personality of the role as appropriately as he does after being captured. His facial image and expressions and actions sometimes seem to carry some melancholy flavor; the scene of the moonlit night after being surrounded and the music also appear relatively gloomy. Of course, the shaping of this character is still successful, but it is not as natural and intimate to the audience as Old Wang and Little Liu. Although there are still some shortcomings, it can be affirmed that this is a relatively successful film in terms of both ideological and artistic qualities.

　　影片《钢铁战士》观后
　　袁水拍
    影片《钢铁战士》是一部富于教育意义的影片，受到了观众的欢迎。它告诉观众，革命的胜利决不是偶然的。它说明了人民的英雄具有多么高贵的革命的品质。它鼓舞人们向这些无产阶级的先锋队，优秀的共产党员学习。影片的这些思想内容并不是用干燥的议论来表现的，而是通过艺术的表现，来使观众深深地受到感动。
    《钢铁战士》描写解放战争中和人民密切结合的解放军的优秀战士怎样英勇战斗，坚贞不屈，终于取得胜利的故事。主人公张排长领导一排人掩护一个团的转移。任务完成后，他们奉令撤退，可是已经受到敌人的包围。张排长指挥全排血战了五昼夜，打退敌人无数次的进攻，一直坚持到最后。当地农民传递情报，指引他们跳崖突围，不幸没有成功。在白刃战中，大部分战士英勇牺牲。张排长、炊事员老王、年幼的通讯员小刘和一个动摇分子被敌人俘虏。敌人用酷刑、利诱、色情的软化和其他胁迫，都不能使战士吐露埋藏机器和粮食的地点。最后，人民解放军发动反攻，歼灭了敌人，解放了这个地区，从狱中救出张排长，继续向前胜利进军。
    张排长是解放军里面无数英勇坚强的指战员之一。剧作者选择这样一个典型人物来表现主题是非常适合的。象许多战士一样，他是一个受封建压迫的农民出身的兵士，在共产党和毛主席的领导和教育下，锻炼成为一个经得起一切考验的《钢铁战士》。敌人无论怎样残暴狡猾，在这样忠于党、忠于人民的战士面前，是毫无办法的。中国人民解放军战士的高度的阶级觉悟和革命的英雄气概在张排长身上充分体现了出来。
    但张排长决不是一个单独的例子、一个孤立的英雄。炊事员老王和通讯员小刘也同样是光辉的解放军的典型人物。他们百折不挠，临难不苟，立场坚定，敌友分明，用小刘在牺牲前的一句单纯明确和充满力量的遗言来说，就是“革命到底”。这两个人物和他们的所作所为是特别吸引观众的。编剧和导演显然对这样的典型人物相当熟悉，写来毫不费力而真实亲切。演员的表演也称职，没有不必要的夸张。炊事员老王在狱中识破动摇分子所施的离间计的一幕，描写得比较细腻。叛徒的愚蠢，战士的机警，表现得很真实。原来温和的眼睛在发觉敌人奸谋的时候，突然闪烁出智慧和仇恨的光；原来假装得困乏样子的身体，此时突然象猛虎一般扑击奸徒，大呼“打反革命”。这些处理是美妙的。
    小刘这个人物很可爱。观众非常喜爱并且尊敬这个“小鬼”。他和审讯他的敌政工处长周旋斗智的一场，是引人入胜的。他答复那时而威胁，时而利诱的特务的问话，说得多么简单有力，而又适合孩子的口吻。例如特务要他说出埋藏机器、粮食的地点，他答回道：“我不说。我说了，不是变成反革命了吗？”作者刻划他是在党的领导下的一个受到革命锻炼的战士，同时也适当地表现了他的稚气和活泼的一面。例如他在狱中把敌人送来的点心吃了个饱，说可以“更有劲些”，吃完了把盘子摔个粉碎。这样通过动作来表现性格，就使人物显得真实生动。在解放战争中，曾经涌现了许多年纪还小，可是在党和军队的教育下，成为具有相当高的政治觉悟的小战士。他们忠于革命，勇于战斗，是革命的年青一代的代表者。苏联有丹娘和顿巴斯矿区的青年，我们也有很多的象影片中的小通讯员刘海泉。我们的艺术家有责任特别为我们的青年创造出在艺术上完整的典型来。
    不但是军队里有这样的《钢铁战士》，在人民中也有无数的钢铁的人物。张排长的母亲和掩护越狱出来的张排长的许多农民，就都是这样的人物。敌人想利用母子之间的爱来动摇张排长，可是非但我们的战士没有动摇，而且敌人所预期的母亲对儿子的劝降，变成了革命的鼓励。当观众看到那衰老的，然而坚强的，一个平凡的农村妇女的视死如归的精神，不禁感动得流下泪来。这样的人物是新的、觉悟的人民的典型，同时也是我们民族的优秀传统的代表者。同样的，那些宁愿被枪杀而决不出卖解放军的农民们也使观众深受感动。影片描写这些普通人民的伟大，同时也就显出了军队与人民的亲密关系。一方面，老乡冒险穿过包围圈，给军队送粮送弹送情报，另一方面，军队在万分艰难中还关心着村里农民有没有遭难；一方面，农民宁愿用自己的死来换得战士的生，另一方面，战士不肯连累人民，情愿挺身而出，自己牺牲。这些描写成功地表现了“军民一体”的思想，也说明了人民的军队必然胜利的道理。
    影片的情节有曲折，有悬宕，人物的刻划也具体生动，因此主题显得有力量，而不落公式主义的窠臼。例如阵地上宣誓一场，很会变成议论与口号的堆砌。但影片并不是这样，当小刘把笔记本上的毛主席像放在岩石上，战士们都举起手来后，这一镜头就结束了。在这里，手法显得很经济。
    影片《钢铁战士》保持了、也发展了原来的舞台剧的一些优点，但有时还嫌拘泥于原作。战士们打退敌人数次进攻，所据守的山头在影片中显不出是一个形势险要的军事据点。有些镜头似乎和舞台面差不多，没有充分运用电影艺术的优越条件。灯光和布景的真实性也还不够。此外，影片中演张排长的演员在开始的几场中，表现得不及被捕后那样与角色的身份性格贴切。他的面部的形象以及表情、动作有时似乎还带着一些忧郁的味道；被包围后的月夜的场面以及音乐也显得比较阴暗一些。当然，这个人物的塑造还是成功的，只是不及老王和小刘那样使观众觉得自然亲切。虽还有这样一些缺点，但可以肯定，这是一部无论在思想性和艺术性上都是比较成功的影片。
