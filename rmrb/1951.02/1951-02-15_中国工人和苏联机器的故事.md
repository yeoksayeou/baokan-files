\tThe Story of Chinese Workers and Soviet Machines

\tAfter the signing of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement, the Soviet machines that the workers had been looking forward to arrived. As soon as the machines were unloaded from the trucks, the fifty-odd workers of the hexagonal turret lathe team of the Northeast Machinery Bureau's Seventh Factory immediately surrounded them. Yu, the production committee member of the trade union, rushed to write "This is Yu Yingzhou's" on the machine box. After the administration assigned the machine to him, he wiped and cleaned it all day long, countless times a day.

\tHowever, to his surprise, their team had been working on screws for more than half a year. In the past, they produced 200 screws a day using Japanese and American lathes, but using the Soviet lathe didn't seem to increase production much. So, Lao Yu and his colleagues wondered, "What exactly is so advanced about the Soviet lathe?"

\tOn November 30th last year, the Northeast Daily published a news item: five Soviet working machine tool experts, led by Chief Engineer Brosgulinn, came to China to help our workers master the technology to maximize the working efficiency of Soviet machine tools. During their demonstrations at the Third Factory, they showed amazing results - the depth of cut was 66% to 400% higher than the depth of cut our workers usually used, the labor production efficiency was four to 31.2 times higher than our workers' usual labor production efficiency, and the highest number of rotations per minute of the lathe was more than 245% higher than when our workers operated it. This news caused a sensation among the workers of the hexagonal turret lathe team of the Seventh Factory. Old Li, who had been working for more than ten years, sighed and said, "When I was an apprentice, when I asked the Japanese how to calculate gear wheels, not only did they refuse to teach me, but I also got a slap in the face! The Soviets not only bring machines, but also teach us how to use them. Even real brothers wouldn't do that!" But the old worker Gu Tou didn't believe it. He still didn't pay much attention and said, "Don't you think that you can use such a big cut for small jobs? Can we use it to turn one-cent screws?" Production committee member Lao Yu refused to accept his attitude, and studied the newspaper for half the night. He thought: learning from Soviet experience is not "blindly copying," but should be applied flexibly. We should use our brains to transform tools and operating methods, and make the most of the lathe's capabilities. So, he and team leader Cui and Lao Li began to study. Lao Gu Tou was still coldly saying, "No matter how you change it, you can't turn out a screw at once." But Lao Yu's confidence was very firm. He wanted to use facts to convince Lao Gu Tou.

\tTwo days later, Lao Yu figured out a reason. It turned out that the tool holder of the Soviet hexagonal turret lathe was round, which was different from the hexagonal tool holder made in Japan, but in the past, everyone still used the old method for turning screws, which had a total of five procedures. Lao Yu came up with a way to reduce one procedure and proposed it to team leader Cui. After everyone studied it, they thought the method was very good. When it came time to experiment, Lao Yu was about to move the bed from 488 revolutions to 755 revolutions, Lao Gu Tou quickly grabbed his hand, and the onlookers all said, "I'm afraid the motor won't be able to handle it!" But Lao Yu quickly replied, "Why don't you believe in the strength of the Soviet lathe? They used 1,200 revolutions during their demonstrations!" When he moved the speed controller to 755 revolutions, everyone's hearts were beating fast, and dozens of eyes were fixed on the workpiece and the motor. Lao Yu calmly turned the handle, cut in, the apprentice poured oil on it, and watched as the first workpiece came out. Team leader Cui looked at his watch and said, "One minute and ten seconds!" Lao Li calculated: in the past, it was two minutes and thirty seconds, and the efficiency was doubled! After working like this for more than three hours, the motor that everyone was worried about didn't get hot at all. Only then did Lao Gu Tou keep praising, "Wonderful! Wonderful! The Soviets are wonderful!" His apprentice Xiao Liu teased him and said, "Didn't you say it wasn't good? How is it good again this time?" Lao Gu Tou chanted, "It's not that the equipment is not good, it's that our brains are too old!"

### 中国工人和苏联机器的故事

　　中国工人和苏联机器的故事
    中苏贸易协定签订后，工人们盼望的苏联机器运来了。机器刚从汽车上卸下来，东北机械局第七厂六角车床班的五十多位工人即刻围了上去；工会生产委员老于抢着在机器箱上写下“这就是于赢洲的”。行政上将这台机器分配给他以后，他整天擦呀洗的，一天数不清有多少遍。
    但是，出乎他的意料，他们班作了半年多的螺丝活，过去用日本和美国车床一天出二百个，使用了苏联车床也没见多出多少。于是，老于他们纳闷起来了：“苏联车床到底先进在哪里呢？”
    去年十一月三十日，东北日报登载着这样一条消息：以布罗斯古林总工程师为首的五位苏联工作母机专家，来中国帮助我国工人掌握技术，以便发挥苏联机床的工作效能。他们在三厂表演时显出了惊人的成绩——吃刀深度比我国工人经常的吃刀深度高出百分之六十六到百分之四百，劳动生产效率比我国工人经常的劳动生产效率提高四倍到三十一点二倍，车床每分钟最高的旋转次数比我国工人操作时增加百分之二百四十五以上。这一消息使得七厂六角车床班的工人们都轰动起来。干了十几年活的老李感叹地说：“我当学徒时，问问日本仔怎样算牙轮，他不肯教还不算，倒挨了一个大耳光！人家苏联来了机器不算，还教咱们怎样使用，亲兄弟也不过如此呀！”但是工人老谷头却不相信，他还是不大搭理地说：“你们也没想想，干小活还能吃那大的刀，咱们车一分螺丝能用的上吗？”生产委员老于不服他的气，捧着报纸研究了半宿，他寻思：学习苏联经验不是“死搬桩”，应该活用，用脑筋改造工具和操作法，要把车床的能力都发挥出来。于是，他就和崔班长、老李开始进行研究。老谷头还在一旁冷冰冰地说：“怎么改也不能一下车出一个螺丝来。”但是老于的信心很坚定，他要用事实来使老谷头心服口服。
    两天以后，老于研究出个道理来了。原来苏联六角车床的刀架子是圆的，和日本造的六角形刀架子不同，但过去大家车螺丝还是用老方法，一共有五道手续。老于想出了减少一道手续的办法，向崔班长提了出来，大家研究后认为这办法很好。到试验的时候，老于正要把床子由四百八十八转搬到七百五十五转，老谷头急忙把住他的手，旁边围观的人也都说：“电滚怕撑不住吧！”但老于很快地回答：“你们怎么不相信苏联车床的劲头呢？人家表演时还使一千二百转哩！”当他把调速器搬到七百五十五转时，大家的心里直跳，几十双眼睛都盯在活和电滚上面。老于不慌不忙地摇着摇把，吃上刀，徒弟给浇着油，眼看着第一个活出来了。崔班长看看手表说：“整一分十秒！”老李头一算：过去是二分三十秒，效率提高了一倍！这样一直干了三个多钟头，大家耽心的电滚一点也没发热。老谷头这才不住嘴地称赞着：“妙哇！妙哇！还是苏联的妙哇！”跟他的学徒小刘捉弄他说：“你不是说不好吗？这回怎么又好了？”老谷头念叨着：“不是人家的玩艺不好，是咱的脑筋太旧了！”
