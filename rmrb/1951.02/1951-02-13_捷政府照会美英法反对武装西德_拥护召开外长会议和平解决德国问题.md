Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to TASS, Prague: Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Široký delivered notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on February 7th, stating the position of the government of the Czechoslovak Republic on the German question.

The notes condemn the Western occupying powers for systematically violating the obligations of demilitarizing and denazifying Germany. The notes state: Czechoslovakia's security depends on eliminating any possibility of German aggression, because it is directly adjacent to Germany and has experienced the painful history of German imperialist aggression. The Czechoslovak people believe that measures that violate existing obligations and the obligations stipulated in the Four-Power Agreements are a threat to their security.

The notes accuse the Western countries of realizing their aggressive goals with the assistance of the remnants of the former Nazi militarist and imperialist groups, and especially emphasize the recent exposure of the Western occupying powers' plans to use and organize traitors who have fled from Czechoslovakia.

The notes conclude: The Czechoslovak government hopes to accelerate the end of the unfavorable development of the German question and resolve this issue on the basis of four-power cooperation. The Czechoslovak government fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers and urges the US government to participate in this meeting in order to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the German question. The Czechoslovak government is convinced that the solution of this problem is one of the most fundamental conditions for maintaining world peace.
