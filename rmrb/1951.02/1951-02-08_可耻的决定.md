　　A Shameful Decision
　　*Pravda* Editorial

　　The U.S. government has rejected all efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues. The U.S. government is once again appearing before the world as an arrogant aggressor, using only commands and threats in its language towards other countries.
　　The resolution slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," routinely passed by the Political Committee on January 30 under U.S. instructions, has no legal effect and will never have any legal effect; it is merely one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the United Nations. The people of all countries will never recognize this resolution. The January 30 resolution has completely exposed the U.S. as being against a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues. This resolution is unprecedentedly brazen and has aroused the anger of all peace-loving people. All those who disregard the interests of their countries and slavishly obey the orders of Wall Street, causing the honor and dignity of their countries' people to suffer unprecedented insult, must share responsibility for the passage of this proposal with the U.S. aggressors. Britain, France, and other Americanized countries are indeed paying an extremely high price for their "cooperation" with the U.S. aggressors.
　　At the same time, the Political Committee's discussion of the Korean question has shown the world the depth of the contradictions within the aggressive North Atlantic alliance camp. As U.S. imperialism further advances on the path of aggression and adventure and intensifies its pressure on vassal states, these contradictions are becoming increasingly acute.
　　The U.S. aggressors' submission of their proposal to the UN Political Committee shows that they want to repeat, on an expanded scale, the evil trick they have already used once. Everyone knows what kind of trick the U.S. relied on June 27, 1950, violating UN principles and the Charter, to smuggle a proposal declaring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as an aggressor into the Security Council, at a time when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was being invaded by the troops of Syngman Rhee acting under U.S. instructions. The U.S. ruling clique needed this illegal action to use armed forces against the Korean people.
　　Now, everyone can see clearly that the U.S.'s aim in aggressing against Korea is to enslave the Korean people and turn Korea into a springboard for aggression against Korea's neighbors, and first of all against the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China has opened a path to progress and prosperity for its great people. Therefore, it was not accidental that at the beginning of the military events in Korea, the U.S. government occupied Taiwan Island (which has been a part of China since time immemorial) and dispatched the Seventh Fleet to station itself in the Taiwan Strait, thereby carrying out an act of aggression against China. The representatives of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries have fully exposed the role of U.S. imperialism in organizing and carrying out armed intervention against the Korean people in the Security Council and the UN General Assembly based on irrefutable documentary material.
　　Due to the defeats suffered by the U.S. army in Korea, the U.S. aggressors' military adventure in Korea has obviously suffered a disastrous defeat. Now, the U.S. ruling clique is trying to retaliate for their defeats in Korea and create conditions for expanding aggression against China. For this purpose, they are using the United Nations. They stubbornly believe that the United Nations is their docile tool, which should serve the aggressive plans of U.S. policy.
　　That is how things are. Facts prove that U.S. diplomacy has carried out all kinds of tricks in order to gain a respite in Korea so that it can regroup its forces in the future and launch an aggression against the People's Republic of China. No matter how furiously Truman, Acheson, Austin, and other leaders and spokesmen of U.S. policy rage, no matter what kind of treachery they use, and no matter how they lie and slander, the undeniable facts are clear to everyone. The facts explain everything.
　　How have events unfolded?
　　The U.S. government has rejected the suggestions contained in the reply from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to the Political Committee, which are known to everyone. They proceed from an indisputable principle, which is that ending U.S. aggression against the Korean people and the People's Republic of China, withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, and withdrawing U.S. armed forces from Taiwan Island and the Taiwan Strait are the primary and necessary conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues. The government of the People's Republic of China proposed convening a seven-nation conference—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, the People's Republic of China, India, and Egypt—in order to reach an agreement on this issue. According to the plan of the government of the People's Republic of China, this conference must reach an agreement on a temporary ceasefire so that negotiations can then be conducted on the above-mentioned issues. These suggestions are a continuation of the consistent policy of the Chinese government to strengthen peace and security in the Far East.
　　All peace-loving people, first and foremost the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, firmly support the Chinese government's peace plan.
　　The Anglo-American bloc's rejection, under U.S. pressure, of the suggestions of the government of the People's Republic of China, has meant, and still means, that the U.S. does not want to end its armed intervention in Korea and does not want to withdraw its troops from that place. In other words, the U.S. still does not want a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This is the attitude of the aggressor. No amount of hypocritical assurances about hoping for peace (which the U.S. rulers are said to be full of) can cover this up.
　　Rejecting these suggestions has meant, and still means, that the U.S. does not want to end its aggression against Taiwan, does not want to peacefully resolve other Far Eastern issues, and wants to continue the war. This is the attitude of the aggressor, the attitude of the invader, the attitude of the violator of international agreements.
　　The Central People's Government of China has suggested that a seven-nation conference establish the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
　　Rejecting this suggestion has meant, and still means, that the U.S. government still opposes allowing the People's Republic of China to realize its legitimate right to send representatives to the United Nations. This is the attitude of the aggressor, who, on the one hand, tramples on the principles and Charter of the United Nations, while on the other hand, hypocritically demands that everyone "observe" the Charter and principles of the United Nations.
　　As a result of the U.S. government's threats and intimidation of many countries, an unprecedentedly insulting proposal to declare the People's Republic of China as an aggressor was passed, and many countries were forced to submissively vote in favor of this proposal under the pressure of these threats and intimidation methods of U.S. diplomacy. In this matter, the General Assembly's usual "voting machine" was put into full speed again. But this time, the "voting machine" malfunctioned. The governments of many countries, especially the governments of many Asian countries, saw the prospect of the people becoming more and more angry at the policy of supporting and tolerating U.S. aggression. These governments clearly knew what kind of danger supporting the U.S.'s aggressive and adventurous policy against the People's Republic of China would put their own interests and their international position in.
　　Just as the failure of the U.S. adventure in Korea has already caused deep rifts in the North Atlantic alliance, the notorious "voting machine" has also broken down. The *New York Herald Tribune* said, not without alarm: the non-Communist members of the United Nations are facing a split in their ranks over the issue of declaring China as an aggressor.
　　This undisguised alarm from the U.S. reactionary newspaper is justified, because not only the Soviet Union and the people's democracies attending the United Nations, but also the representatives of many Asian and Middle Eastern countries (including India) opposed the U.S. proposal aimed at expanding U.S. aggression in the Far East. This was expressed in the words of the Indian representative Rau, who said: this proposal will have no moral force, and it may cause the expansion of the conflict, and finally even a world war.
　　The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said: This proposal aims to make it easier for U.S. imperialism to continue to occupy Korea and Taiwan, interfere in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, conduct a separate treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, coordinate with its rearmament of West Germany in the West, and drive the people of Asia, Europe, and the world into the abyss of war, in order to fulfill its dream of dominating the world. His words are absolutely correct. Mr. Zhou Enlai said that the U.S. proposal is "simply illegally bypassing the Security Council and directly submitting it to the UN General Assembly to undermine the principle of great power unanimity." His words are undoubtedly correct.
　　From the beginning, the Soviet delegation firmly opposed the U.S. proposal. The Soviet delegation supported the just suggestions of the Chinese government, exposing the true meaning of the conspiracy of the U.S. aggressors, who are trying to guarantee the possibility of continuing their criminal policy against the peace and security of all countries by all means.
　　The U.S. delegation to the United Nations was greatly enraged, and it used all its strength to try to crush all efforts seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean question. The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Gross, issued an official statement, saying that the U.S. will not participate in the meeting discussing the Taiwan issue unless Chiang Kai-shek's representatives attend this meeting. The U.S. House and Senate demonstratively passed resolutions demanding that China be declared an aggressor. The U.S. representative to the Political Committee, Austin, went so far as to rant and rave, scolding his vassals, and demanding an immediate vote on the U.S. proposal.
　　U.S. diplomacy not only used its pressure methods within the Political Committee. The U.S. government also used all methods, from threats to direct intimidation, in order to smuggle the proposal, whose sole purpose was to crush all possibilities for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues, into the General Assembly.
　　The results of this pressure can be clearly seen when the Political Committee and the UN General Assembly held meetings and routinely passed the U.S. proposal in a fire-alarm manner. After shameful submission, in addition to the U.S. and the Latin American countries that have completely lost their independence, the representatives of Britain and France, two of the five major powers primarily responsible for maintaining peace, also voted in favor of this proposal.
　　The representatives of the British Labour government hypocritically pretended to be supporters of a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues, but in reality, they helped the U.S. aggressors with their double-dealing tactics. This double-dealing policy of the British Labour government was once again manifested extremely clearly in this matter.
　　The representatives of Burma, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Soviet Union voted against the U.S. proposal. The representatives of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, and some other countries abstained.
　　The results of the vote are instructive, exposing the despicable arithmetic of U.S. imperialism relying on the mechanical majority vote that executes the will of the U.S. ruling clique under the pressure of the U.S. ruling clique.
　　Even people close to the U.S. ruling clique have had to admit this fact. For example, the famous U.S. journalist Lippmann wrote in the *New York Herald Tribune* on January 31: "The result of the vote is actually a serious failure for our country on basic issues. The main issue is Asia..." Lippmann continued: "As a result of our own clumsy actions, we are today alienated from the major powers and from the people of Asia. The victory that Mr. Austin said he should thank God for is a failure brought about by the Americans themselves."
　　The U.S. and some countries that depend on it and submissively follow it have thwarted the suggestions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and rejected the peace plan proposed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, thereby fully exposing the criminal plan of the U.S. ruling clique not only to continue its military adventure in the Far East, but also to expand this adventure on an increasingly large scale. The recent influx of U.S. military supplies into Taiwan, the strengthening of support for Chiang Kai-shek, the measures to revive Japanese militarism, and the active activities of U.S. war merchants in Japan—all of this points to the direction of the activities of the U.S. aggressors.
　　The shameless decision that the U.S. interventionists forced through the Political Committee and the General Assembly has aroused the anger of millions of honest people in all countries. All peace-loving people condemn the proposal against the People's Republic of China passed by the General Assembly on January 30. This is the guarantee that this proposal and the criminal plans related to it harbored by the arrogant U.S. adventurers are doomed to complete failure.
　　The following words of Mr. Zhou Enlai are completely correct: "Efforts to bury this shameful, reactionary, imperialist U.S. proposal of aggression, which was illegally passed in form, and to make it completely fail, will not only open the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and important Asian issues, but also lay the foundation for opposing aggressive war, defending world peace, and restoring the dignity of the UN Charter."

　　可耻的决定
    苏联真理报社论
    美国政府已拒绝了一切谋求和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的努力。美国政府再度以妄自尊大的侵略者出现在全世界面前，它对其他国家所用的语言只有命令和威胁。
    政治委员会一月三十日在美国的指示下照例行公事通过的诬蔑中华人民共和国“侵略”的决议，不能有而且也决不会有任何法律上的效力；它只是联合国历史上最可耻的章页之一。各国人民决不承认这个决议。一月三十日的决议已完全暴露了美国是反对和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的。这项决议是空前厚颜无耻的，而且激起一切爱好和平人民的愤怒。一切不顾他们的国家的利益而奴颜婢膝地顺从华尔街的命令、使他们的国家的人民的荣誉与尊严受到空前的侮辱的人，都要与美国侵略者一同对通过这提案负责。英法及其他美国化的国家，实在正在为与美国侵略者的“合作”而支付极高的代价。
    同时，政委会对于朝鲜问题的讨论，已向全世界显示了侵略性的北大西洋联盟阵营的矛盾的深度。随着美帝国主义在侵略与冒险道路上进一步前进和加紧对于附庸国的压力，这种矛盾正益趋激烈化。
    美国侵略者向联合国政委会提出他们的提案，就表明了他们是想在扩大的规模上重复采取他们已经一度采用过的罪恶诡计。大家都知道，在一九五○年六月二十七日，美国靠什么样的诡计违反联合国原则与宪章，把宣布朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为侵略者的提案偷运到安理会中，那时候正是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国遭到依照美国的指示而行动的李承晚部队的侵略。美国统治集团为要用武装部队对付朝鲜人民，是需要这种非法行动的。
    现在，一切人都可以看清楚，美国侵略朝鲜的目的就是奴役朝鲜人民，把朝鲜变成对朝鲜的邻邦、首先是对中华人民共和国进行侵略的跳板。中华人民共和国已为它的伟大人民开辟了走向进步与繁荣的道路。因此，在朝鲜军事事件开始之初，这就不是偶然的，即：美国政府占领了台湾岛（从不可记忆的时候起台湾就是中国的一部分），并派遣第七舰队驻守台湾海峡，从而对中国进行了侵略行动。苏联、中华人民共和国及其他国家的代表已经根据无可争辩的文件材料，在安理会及联合国大会中充分揭露了美帝国主义在组织与实行对朝鲜人民武装干涉当中的作用。
    由于美国军队在朝鲜所遭受的失败，美国侵略者在朝鲜的军事冒险显然已受到了惨败。现在，美国统治集团力图为他们在朝鲜遭受的失败进行报复，并创造扩大对中国之侵略的条件。为了这一目的，他们利用联合国。他们顽梗地认为联合国是他们的驯服的工具，应该为美国政策的侵略计划服务。
    事情就是如此。事实证明美国外交进行了一切诡计，为的是在朝鲜求得喘息时间，以便能够在往后重新聚集力量，发动对中华人民共和国的侵略。不管杜鲁门、艾奇逊、奥斯汀及美国政策的其他领袖与发言人如何暴跳如雷，不管他们使用什么样的奸计，也不管他们怎样撒谎和诽谤，无可争辩的事实对一切人都是明白的。事实说明了一切。
    事件的演变如何呢？
    美国政府已拒绝了中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来致政委会的复文中包含的建议，这些建议是大家都知道的。它们从一个不容置辩的原则出发，这个原则就是：结束美国对朝鲜人民及对中华人民共和国的侵略，自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及自台湾岛及台湾海峡撤退美国武装部队，这些是和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的首要的及必要的条件。中华人民共和国政府提议召开七国——苏联、美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国、印度及埃及——会议，以便对这个问题获致协议。按照中华人民共和国政府的计划，这个会议必须对暂时停火获致协议，以便随后可以就上述各问题进行谈判。这些建议是中国政府所遵循的加强远东和平与安全的一贯政策的继续。
    一切爱好和平的人民，首先是苏联及各人民民主国家，坚决支持中国政府的和平计划。
    英美集团在美国压力下拒绝中华人民共和国政府的建议，这已经意味着、现在仍意味着美国不想结束对朝鲜的武装干涉，不想从该地撤退它的军队。换句话说，美国直到现在还不想和平解决朝鲜问题。这就是侵略者的态度。任何关于希望和平（据说美国统治者充满了对和平的希望）的虚伪保证是掩盖不了这一点的。
    拒绝这些建议已经意味着、现在仍然意味着美国不想结束对台湾的侵略，不想和平解决远东其他问题，而想继续战争。这是侵略者的态度、侵犯者的态度、国际协定的违反者的态度。
    中国中央人民政府建议七国会议确立中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    拒绝这个建议已经意味着、现在仍然意味着美国政府直到现在还在反对使中华人民共和国派代表到联合国的合法权利得以实现。这是侵略者的态度，这个侵略者一方面蹂躏着联合国的原则和宪章，同时又假惺惺地要求大家“遵守”联合国的宪章和原则。
    由于美国政府威胁与恫吓许多国家的结果，宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者的一个空前未有的侮辱性提案获得通过，那许多国家在美国外交的这些威胁和恫吓的方法的压力下被迫驯服地投票赞成这个提案。在这件事情上，大会惯常的“表决机器”又以全速开动起来。但是这一次“表决机器”发生毛病了。许多国家的政府，首先是亚洲许多国家的政府，看到人民对支持和容忍美国侵略的政策更加愤怒的远景。这些政府显然知道：支持美国针对中华人民共和国的侵略及冒险政策，会把它们自己的利益及它们的国际地位置于何种危险境地。
    正如美国在朝鲜冒险的失败已经在北大西洋联盟中引起深的裂痕一样，臭名昭著的“表决机器”也破裂了。纽约先驱论坛报并不是没有惊恐地这样说：联合国的非共产党会员国已在宣布中国为侵略者的问题上面临它们队伍的分裂。
    这个美国的反动报纸的这种不加掩盖的惊恐是有道理的，因为不仅苏联及出席联合国的人民民主国家，而且许多亚洲及中东国家（包括印度）的代表们都反对旨在扩大美国在远东的侵略的美国提案。这在印度代表劳氏的话中表现出来，他说：这个提案将没有任何道义的力量，它将可能引起冲突的扩大，最后甚至引起世界战争。
    中华人民共和国外交部长说：这个提案旨在使美国帝国主义便于继续侵占朝鲜和台湾，干涉越南和东南亚，进行单独对日缔约和重新武装日本，配合它在西方重新武装西德，并将亚洲、欧洲及世界人民驱入战争深渊，以遂其独霸世界的迷梦。他的话是绝对正确的。周恩来先生说，美国提案是“索性违法地越过安全理事会而直接提交联合国大会，以破坏大国一致的原则”。他的话是无可置疑地正确。
    从一开始起，苏联代表团即坚决反对美国提案。苏联代表团支持中国政府的公正建议，揭穿美国侵略者阴谋的真正意义，美国侵略者力图以一切手段保证继续他们反对各国人民和平与安全的罪恶政策的可能性。
    联合国的美国代表团大为震怒，它用尽一切力量企图粉碎寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的基础的一切努力。美国在联合国的代表葛罗斯发表正式声明，说美国将不参加讨论台湾问题的会议，如果没有蒋介石的代表出席这个会议的话。美国众院和参院示威性地通过决议，要求宣布中国为侵略者。美国在政委会的代表奥斯汀不惜大发雷霆，辱骂他的附庸，要求火速表决美国提案。
    美国外交不仅在政委会以内施用它的压力方法。美国政府还施用一切方法，从威胁到直接的吓诈，以便把它的唯一的目的就是要粉碎和平解决朝鲜及其他远东问题一切可能性的提案偷运到大会。
    在政委会及联合国大会举行会议以火警的方式例行公事地通过了美国的提案时，这个压力所造成的结果便可以明显地看出。在可耻的屈从之后，除了美国及完全失掉独立的拉丁美洲国家外，负有维持和平的主要责任的五强之中的英法两国的代表，也投票赞成这个提案。
    英国工党政府的代表伪善地装作希望朝鲜问题及其他远东问题和平解决的拥护者的角色，但实际上却以他们的两面手法帮助美国侵略者，英国工党政府这种两面政策在这件事上再度表现得极其显明。
    缅甸、白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、波兰、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国及苏联等国代表投票反对美国的提案。弃权的有巴基斯坦、阿富汗、印尼、埃及、叙利亚及若干其他国家的代表。
    投票的结果是有教益的，它暴露了美帝国主义凭持在美国统治集团的压力下执行美国统治集团意志的机械多数的投票的卑劣算学。
    甚至接近美国统治集团的人士，也不得不承认这个事实。譬如著名的美国新闻记者李普曼一月三十一日在纽约先驱论坛报上写道：“表决的结果实际上乃是我国在基本问题方面的严重失败。主要问题是亚洲……”李普曼继称：“我们自己的笨拙行动的结果，使我们今天与各大国、与亚洲各国的人民都疏远了。奥斯汀先生所说的要感谢上帝的胜利，是美国人自己招致的失败。”
    美国及若干依赖它并驯服地追随它的国家挫阻了和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，拒绝了中华人民共和国中央人民政府提出的和平计划，从而充分地暴露了美国统治集团的罪恶计划不仅是为了继续它在远东的军事冒险，而且要在一个越来越大的规模上把这一冒险扩大。最近美国军用物资的源源流入台湾、对蒋介石支持的加强、使日本军国主义复活的措施、美国战争贩子在日本的积极活动——所有这一切都指明了美国侵略者活动的方向。
    美国干涉者通过政委会与大会所强行通过的无耻的决定，已经引起各国千百万正直人民的愤怒。一切爱好和平人民都谴责一月三十日大会通过的针对中华人民共和国的提案，这就是这个提案以及傲慢的美国冒险家们所怀有的与此有关的罪恶计划都注定要完全失败的保证。
    周恩来先生所说的以下的话是完全正确的：“努力于葬送这一在形式上被非法通过的可耻的侵略的反动的帝国主义的美国提案，使之彻底归于失败，将不仅为和平解决朝鲜问题及亚洲重要问题开辟道路，而且为反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平及恢复联合国宪章的尊严奠定基础”。
