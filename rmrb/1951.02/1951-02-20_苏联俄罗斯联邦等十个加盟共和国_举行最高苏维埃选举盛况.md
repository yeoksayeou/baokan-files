Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS reports: On the 18th, the Supreme Soviet elections were held in ten union republics of the Soviet Union, including the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. The elections took place in a festive atmosphere. Numerous voters from all over rushed to the polling stations before 6:00 AM as scheduled, waiting to elect the candidates of the Stalin party and non-party alliance.

　　In the heroic city of Leningrad, in the Kirov electoral district where the great Stalin was a candidate for the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, all voters cast their ballots before 10:00 AM. Among those who participated in the voting were veteran Bolsheviks who had participated in the October Revolution and veteran soldiers who stormed the Winter Palace. An old metalworker, Sobolev, said: "I have never been so happy as I am today, because I am electing Comrade Stalin, who leads us to fight for peace and constructive labor."

　　Moscow was decorated exceptionally beautifully with banners and colorful slogans. In the city's 1,679 electoral districts, the vast majority of voters cast their ballots before noon. In the Molotov electoral district in the capital, hundreds of people crowded the polling stations before 6:00 AM, preparing to vote for Stalin's close comrade-in-arms, Molotov. Sekande, the most outstanding assembly worker at the "Giopripol" factory, was one of the first to vote, renowned throughout the city for completing 400 to 700 percent of the production target every day.

　　The vast majority of voters in many union republics cast their ballots before 2:00 PM. Among them, the voters who had already voted in Moldova and Latvia accounted for more than 99 percent of all voters, Azerbaijan more than 97 percent, and Lithuania reached 96 percent. Ninety-nine percent of the voters in Kyrgyzstan cast their ballots before 5:00 PM. In these republics, in all electoral districts where Stalin was a candidate, all registered voters cast their ballots before 10:00 to 11:00 AM. After the voting ended, many voters in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and other union republics remained at the polling stations to enthusiastically discuss Stalin's talk to a Pravda reporter on the current international situation. An old worker from Tajikistan, Yudalov, said: "The wise Stalin exposed the bloody plans of the new war instigators—the American and British imperialists. We must strive to strengthen the strength of the great Soviet Union and unswervingly support the policy of peace."

　　In all the towns and villages of the Soviet Far East, dawn came especially early. When Moscow was just beginning to vote, voting in Kamchatka, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, and other places was nearing completion. Polling stations in cities such as Novosibirsk, Vladivostok, and Yakutsk were crowded with voters early in the morning. As of 2:00 PM, 94.3 percent of the voters in the ten electoral districts of the Primorsky Territory and 93.9 percent of the voters in the Boli area had completed voting. Fishermen from Baikal, hunters from Yakutia, and farmers from Altai put on their best national costumes to go to vote.

　　Polling stations were set up on ships sailing far away so that voters could vote while traveling. Most of the ships on the Far East sea lanes completed voting in a very short time. Passengers on trains and Stakhanovite workers in sanatoriums also fulfilled their civic rights within the stipulated time.

　　苏联俄罗斯联邦等十个加盟共和国        
    举行最高苏维埃选举盛况
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社消息：苏联的俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克、乔治亚、阿塞拜疆、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、摩尔达维亚、塔吉克和卡累利阿——芬兰等十个加盟共和国于十八日举行了最高苏维埃选举。选举是在节日气氛中进行的。各地的众多选民都在规定时间上午六时以前赶到投票站，等候选举斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人。
    在英雄的列宁格勒城，以伟大的斯大林为俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表候选人的基洛夫选区，全体选民在上午十时以前就投完了票，参加投票的人当中有一些是参加过十月革命的老布尔什维克和进攻冬宫的老战士。老五金工人索波列夫说：“我从来没有今天这样快乐。因为我选举了最亲爱的斯大林同志，他领导我们为和平与建设性劳动而斗争。”
    莫斯科城被锦旗和彩色标语装饰得分外美丽。在全市的一千六百七十九个选区中，绝大多数的选民在正午以前就投了票。首都莫洛托夫选区在上午六时以前就有数百人拥挤在投票站，准备投票选举斯大林的亲密战友莫洛托夫。“吉奥普里波尔”工厂最优秀的装配工人塞堪得是最先投票者之一，他以每天完成生产目标百分之四百到七百而名闻全市。
    许多加盟共和国的绝大多数选民都在下午二时以前投了票。其中摩尔达维亚和拉脱维亚已投票的选民均占全部选民百分之九十九以上，阿塞拜疆占百分之九十七以上，立陶宛达百分之九十六。吉尔吉斯百分之九十九的选民在下午五时以前投了票。在这些共和国中，以斯大林为候选人的一切选区，全部登记的选民在上午十时至十一时以前就投完了票。吉尔吉斯、塔吉克及其他加盟共和国的许多选民在投票结束后，都停留在投票站上热烈讨论斯大林就目前国际形势向真理报记者发表的谈话。塔吉克的老工人俞达留夫说：“英明的斯大林揭穿了新战争挑拨者——美英帝国主义者的血腥计划。我们要努力增强伟大苏联的实力，坚定不移地拥护和平政策。”
    在苏联远东地区的一切城镇与乡村，黎明来得特别早。当莫斯科刚刚开始投票的时候，堪察加、千岛群岛、萨哈连等地的投票已将近结束。新西伯利亚、海参崴、雅库次克等城市的投票站一清早就拥挤着许多选民。截至下午二时止，滨海区十个选区内百分之九十四点三的选民和伯力区百分之九十三点九的选民已投票完毕。贝加尔的渔夫、雅库特的猎人、阿尔泰的农民都穿上他们最好的民族服装前往投票。
    航行在远方的轮船上都设立了投票站、以便选民们在旅途中投票。远东海轮航线的大多数船只上在很短的时间内就投完了票。火车上的旅客、疗养院中的斯塔哈诺夫工人也在规定的时间内履行了他们的公民权利。
