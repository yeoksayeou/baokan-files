Xinhua News Agency: The broad masses of peasants in East China who have overturned their lives are actively participating in winter study. In Shandong Province, 2 million peasants are participating in winter study; in Northern Jiangsu, there are more than 500,000; and in Southern Jiangsu, there are 600,000. In Southern Anhui, in just five counties, including Shexian, Guichi, and Taiping, 1,315 winter schools have been established, with some counties and districts achieving one school per village. In Northern Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces where land reform has been carried out or is underway in some villages, the winter study movement has also gradually begun.

In order to run this year's winter studies well, various localities have held winter study teacher training classes. In Southern and Northern Jiangsu alone, more than 20,000 winter study teachers have been trained. Various localities have also established winter study committees at all levels from top to bottom and have compiled and printed a large number of winter study materials. Shandong Province has compiled and printed 2.4 million copies of winter study textbooks. In teaching, many areas have made extensive use of the "little teacher system" as an auxiliary teaching method, and some have improved agricultural production techniques through mutual teaching and learning among farmers. In carrying out current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and land reform policy education, the general approach has been classroom lectures, group discussions, and summaries by winter study teachers.

The peasants participating in winter studies in various places have shown great enthusiasm for learning. In many areas, peasants participating in winter studies have established winter study classroom rules and systems for requesting leave and making up lessons through democratic discussion. Some winter study students in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui have earned money to buy kerosene for evening classes by collectively chopping firewood and transporting goods. In Guo Village, Baiyan County (a newly established county southwest of Feixian) in the old liberated area of Shandong, peasants who have overturned their lives have voluntarily donated grain to build new school buildings. Many peasants participating in winter studies in Southern Jiangsu have filled their bedside areas, farm tools, and hands with newly learned characters. After more than a month of study, illiterate people who previously did not know a single character can generally recognize and write 80 to 100 characters. In Rugao County, Northern Jiangsu, where winter classes started earlier, some students can already recognize and write more than 300 characters. In Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, winter studies have overcome the thinking of some peasants who believed that "having land means you can cultivate it slowly" after land reform and have expanded the area of winter cultivation. Young and middle-aged farmers have strengthened their determination to defend the fruits of their liberation through learning, voluntarily joined local armed forces, and intensified winter defense.

　　华东翻身农民
　　踊跃参加冬学
    【新华社讯】华东区广大翻身农民正积极参加冬学。山东省参加冬学学习的农民已有二百万人，苏北区有五十多万人，苏南有六十万人。皖南仅歙县、贵池、太平等五个县，已建立冬学一千三百十五所，部分县区已做到一村一校。皖北、浙江、福建等省正在进行和业已完成土地改革的部分乡村，亦已逐步展开冬学运动。
    各地为了办好今年的冬学，曾举办冬学师资训练班，仅苏南、苏北两区训练的冬学教师即有两万余名。各地并自上而下建立了各级冬学委员会，编印了大批冬学教材。山东省编印的冬学课本即达二百四十万册。在教学中，很多地区的文化课都大量运用了辅助教学的小先生制，有的通过农民互教互学，提高农业生产技术。在进行抗美援朝时事教育和土地改革政策教育时，一般采取了课堂讲解、分组讨论、由冬学教师作总结的办法进行。
    各地参加冬学的农民学习热情都很高。许多地区参加冬学的农民，经过民主讨论，建立了冬学课堂秩序，和请假、补课制度。苏北、皖北区的部分冬学学生并以集体砍柴、运输等办法来赚钱购买晚间上课的灯油。山东老区白彦县（新设县，在费县西南）郭家庄翻身农民，自愿捐集了粮食，建立了新校舍。苏南很多参加冬学的农民，在他们的床头上、农具上和手上都画满了生字。经过一个多月来的学习，过去一字不识的文盲，一般已能认写八十到一百多个生字。苏北如皋县开课较早的冬学，有的学员已能认写三百多生字。浙江省新登县通过冬学克服了某些农民在土地改革结束后，认为“有了土地可以慢慢耕作”的思想，并扩大了冬耕面积。青壮年农民通过学习加强了保卫翻身果实的决心，自动地参加地方武装，加紧冬防。
