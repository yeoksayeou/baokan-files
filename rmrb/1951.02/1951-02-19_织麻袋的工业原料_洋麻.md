Industrial Raw Material for Weaving Sacks - Kenaf
　　Liu Weicheng
　　Hemp, silk, and cotton are the three major raw materials of the textile industry. Among them, hemp fiber has the strongest tensile strength, generally eight to nine times greater than cotton fiber. The raw materials used for weaving sacks are mainly jute, ramie, and kenaf. Jute is mainly produced in Zhejiang and Guangdong; ramie is mainly produced in Hebei and Pingyuan; kenaf is suitable for widespread planting, and production areas have spread to Hebei, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin and other provinces. Among them, Shandong, Liaodong, and Zhejiang have the largest output, accounting for more than 80% of the total output; in Hebei Province, only Luannan, Leting, Fengrun and other places in eastern Hebei produce it, but the largest ramie producing area near Tianjin is also most suitable for planting kenaf.
　　The transliteration of "洋麻" [kenaf] is "Kenaf" or "Ambari", but there is no suitable translation so far. When the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast, in order to strengthen the plunder of China's fiber resources, they researched and tried to plant kenaf in the Liaohe River basin. After the trial planting was successful, they promoted the planting in Guanwai [Northeast China] from 1933. After Japan surrendered, because kenaf has low cost, high yield (each mu can yield up to 350 jin of mature hemp (retted)), and is resistant to disasters, farmers still plant a lot of it because it is more profitable than other hemp, and it has gradually spread to various places inside the customs [rest of China].
　　Kenaf is a herbaceous plant with stems about seven and a half feet long. According to its stem color, it is divided into red stem species (stems, petioles, and leaf veins are purple) and green stem species (stems and leaves are green). The outside of the stem is smooth and shiny, with leaves all around, the leaves are shaped like plates, blooming large yellow flowers, the flower heart is light red. Kenaf fiber is greenish-white, shiny, about seven feet long, longer than ramie fiber, soft in texture, and strong in tensile strength. From the perspective of the sack industry, the "Tashkent" (transliteration) species in the green stem species is the best.
　　Kenaf has a wide range of uses. In addition to making sacks, ropes, nets, and paper, the oil extracted from kenaf seeds can be used for edible purposes and as a substitute for soybean oil and sesame oil; kenaf seed cake can be used as feed and fertilizer; kenaf raw leaves can be used as feed; and peeled hemp stems can be used as fuel.
　　During the period of Japanese rule, farmers in Northeast China suffered the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes for planting kenaf. In 1944, the enemy and puppet regimes acquired kenaf, and each jin could only be exchanged for two jin of sorghum. Hemp farmers were forced to plant, and their lives were extremely difficult. After liberation, the People's Government helped North China manufacturers organize the Raw Hemp Purchasing Committee to uniformly purchase in the producing areas in order to improve quality, standardize specifications, and ensure the supply of raw materials. In order to promote the increased production of kenaf, it is stipulated that the parity price of kenaf is three jin to three and a half jin, which is half a jin more rice per jin than ramie, which is more than double the price during the enemy and puppet rule. This has greatly benefited hemp farmers.
　　The quality of sacks must be improved, and the raw materials used must be of good quality and quantity, and kenaf has these two conditions better than ramie and jute. However, the current national output of kenaf can only supply the needs of the Northeast and Tianjin; the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council's decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951 also requires an increase of 69.1% in hemp for sack production. Therefore, the timely promotion of kenaf planting can complete this task.

### 织麻袋的工业原料——洋麻

　　织麻袋的工业原料——洋麻
　　刘维城
    麻、丝、棉是纺织工业的三大原料，其中以麻皮纤维的拉力最强，一般较棉纤维拉力大八、九倍。纺织麻袋用的原料主要有黄麻、青麻、洋麻。黄麻主要产于浙江、广东；青麻以河北、平原为主要产地；洋麻则是适宜于普遍种植，产地已遍及河北、浙江、山东、辽东、辽西、吉林等省。其中以山东、辽东、浙江为最多，占总产量的百分之八十以上；河北省目前仅冀东的滦南、乐亭、丰润等地出产，但天津附近地区的青麻最大产地亦最宜于种植洋麻。
    “洋麻”的音译是“坎那夫”或“安培利”，但迄今尚无适当的译名。日寇侵占东北时，为加强掠夺我国纤维资源，在辽河流域研究试种洋麻，试种成功后，从一九三三年起在关外推广种植。日本投降后，因洋麻成本低，产量多（每亩最多可收熟麻（已沤洗的）三百五十斤）、耐灾害，比其他麻类获利多，所以农民至今仍多种植，并逐渐扩展到了关内各地。
    洋麻是草本植物，茎长七尺半左右。按照它的茎色分红茎种（茎，叶柄，叶脉，均呈紫色）和青茎种（茎及叶均呈绿色）两种。茎的外部圆滑光亮，周身是叶，叶形如盘，开大黄花，花心呈淡红色。洋麻纤维呈青白色，有光泽，长约七尺，比青麻纤维长，质柔软，拉力强。从麻袋工业的需要上说，则以青茎种中的“塔希肯托”（译音）种最好。
    洋麻的用途是很广的。它除了制麻袋、打绳、结网、造纸等外，洋麻籽所榨出的油可供食用，并可做大豆油及芝麻油的代用品；洋麻籽饼可以做饲料及肥料；洋麻的生叶可以做饲料；剥过皮的麻茎可以做燃料。
    在日寇统治时期，东北农民种植洋麻受尽了敌伪的压榨。一九四四年敌伪收购洋麻，每斤只能折换二斤高粱米，麻农被强迫种植，生活均极困苦。解放后，人民政府帮助华北厂商组织了原麻采购委员会，统一到产地采购，以达提高品质、划一规格、确保原料供应的目的。为了提倡洋麻的增产，规定洋麻的比价是三斤至三斤半，比青麻每斤多换半斤米，比敌伪统治时期高出一倍以上。这就使麻农得到了很大的利益。
    麻袋的质量必须提高，采用的原料也就必须质好量多，洋麻就比青麻、黄麻具备这两个条件。但，目前全国的洋麻产量，只能供应东北和天津的需要；中央人民政府政务院关于一九五一年农林生产的决定中，又要求增产麻袋用麻百分之六十九点一，因而及时地推广种植洋麻，才能完成这一任务。
