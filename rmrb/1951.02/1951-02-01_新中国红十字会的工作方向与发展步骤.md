　　The Work Direction and Development Steps of the New China Red Cross Society
    Li Dequan, Minister of Health, Central People's Government
            I
    After the reorganization of the Chinese Red Cross Society in early August 1950, which was presided over by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Relief General Association, it became the Red Cross Society of New China. According to the "Constitution of the Chinese Red Cross Society" approved by the Government Administration Council, it is a people's health and rescue organization under the leadership of the Central People's Government. Its policy is based on the general policy of "prevention first" in health work and the relief and welfare policy of "mobilizing and organizing the people to practice self-reliance and mutual assistance," assisting governments at all levels, facing the masses, and publicizing and promoting epidemic prevention, hygiene, medicine, and relief and welfare undertakings. Its tasks are: 1. Unite the masses, undertake rescue training, and promote public health. 2. Promote hygiene and epidemic prevention work and provide medical services. 3. Handle disaster relief and relief medical and health work. 4. In necessary circumstances, undertake international relief and medical services with the approval of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. Its purpose is to assist the government in healing the wounds of war and eliminating disasters, carry out mass health and rescue movements, thereby improving the people's health and cultural level and ensuring the country's economic construction. Its political foundation is based on Article 48 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Promote national sports. Promote health and medical undertakings, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." Its ideological foundation is patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism. All of this together constitutes the nature of the New China Red Cross Society and the direction it should strive for in the future.
    This nature and direction are clearly different from the old Red Cross Society. Therefore, embodying them requires some effort. It has been more than four months since the reorganization of the General Association. Based on the work experience of these four months, it is felt that although the guiding principles of the New China Red Cross Society have been determined, the specific work and development steps in the future are not clear enough. What exactly should be done? How should it be done? Where should we start? All feel vague. Therefore, I specifically raise this for research in order to solve it.
            II
    We know that the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society was reorganized after the October Revolution in 1917. Under the guidance of socialism, its development has been extremely rapid and great in the past thirty-two years. In 1926, it had only 75,000 members, in 1934 it had 5 million members, during the Patriotic War it had as many as 12 million members, in 1945 the membership increased by as many as 500,000 per quarter, and it now has more than 17 million members and more than 230,000 branch societies. It has achieved such development because: First, its activities are truly mass-based, playing a bridge role between the government and the people. Second, it has done a lot of relief and welfare work for war invalids, orphans, and children, embodying the lofty ideals of socialism and humanitarianism. Third, it cooperates with several five-year plans to share the medical service undertakings for the government. Fourth, it has made significant contributions in improving the people's labor and living health conditions and in raising the people's health and cultural level. The following are some main examples: 1. Training a large number of personnel for first aid and health protection work. According to statistics, from July 1941 to July 1945, a total of 22.5 million adults and 6 million school children participated in training. Now the Moscow branch has 700,000 members and 250 organized rescue teams. 2. Organizing health stations, inspecting residences, public dormitories, factories, schools, barbershops, and bathhouses to promote health knowledge, reduce illnesses and industrial injuries, and assist medical personnel in engaging in active prevention work. According to statistics in 1945, there were a total of 254,100 such health stations. After the war, it is planned to establish a medical "center" in every collective farm. According to statistics in 1946, there were a total of 12,000. 3. Providing relief to war invalids, martyrs' and soldiers' families, war orphans, and handling disaster relief. For example, in 1949, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society operated 418 orphanages, 75 nurseries, and 68 war invalid homes, assisting the social departments of various republics in enabling 80 percent of the disabled to restore useful labor. During the drought from 1921 to 1922, 300,000 people were provided with relief daily in the Volga River region. In 1944, the Soviet Red Cross Society raised 600,000 pieces of clothing, 368 tons of food, and more than 14 million rubles in cash as wartime relief gifts. In short, the work of the Soviet Red Cross Society is to organize the masses, educate the masses, and serve the masses. It not only trains its members to become public health workers or first-aiders, but also directly and indirectly trains more people. Its general line is to cooperate with socialist construction and carry out mass health and cultural movements.
    The old Chinese Red Cross Society has a history of forty-six years. Its emergence and forty-six years of work were ideologically based on a combination of feudalism and capitalism, with hypocritical and poisonous humanitarianism. Organizationally, it has been controlled by feudal warlords, politicians, bureaucrats, and reactionary classes. Therefore, although it is a mass organization, it has not been combined with the masses; although it is under the banner of serving the society, its role is to dilute the people's emotions of resistance to the rulers, and even become a tool for the reactionary class to anesthetize the people. Therefore, except for contributing some rescue achievements under the specific historical task of the War of Resistance Against Japan, its work can only be passive, reactive, dispensable, and unable to gain the support of the people. Therefore, the scope of the undertaking has become smaller and smaller, and it has become more and more difficult to do. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 512 branch societies. After the victory of the War of Resistance, plus some newly established branch societies, there were only 193. As of now, after the reorganization of the General Association in August 1950, only 89 are still in contact with the General Association. Based on preliminary investigation and understanding, the current association affairs, business, and ideological situation of these branch societies are described as follows:
    (1) Association affairs: Generally in a state of stagnation, with no specific organizational activities. Most members have no contact. In the past, there were as many as 380,000, but now less than 10,000 are in contact, and few pay membership fees. Less than 20 branch societies can still convene the old board of directors, more than 40 branch societies are maintained by only a few directors, and more than a dozen branch societies have completely disintegrated the board of directors and only have business institutions. In terms of economy, about one-fourth of the branch societies rely on land income to maintain expenses (such as Henan, Sichuan, and other regions), about one-fourth rely on membership fees and donations to maintain expenses, and about two-fourths rely on business income to maintain expenses. These branch societies now consist of about 2,000 people, with directors accounting for about one-sixth and medical staff accounting for 596.
    (2) Business situation: 1. 28 hospitals, with a total of 800 beds, an average of 830 inpatients per month, and an average of 46,610 outpatients per month. 2. 45 clinics, 5 midwifery stations, and 1 trachoma prevention and treatment center, with an average of about 60,000 outpatients per month. 3. 5 medical prevention teams, with an average of 18,000 patients treated per month. 4. 2 nursing schools, 2 midwifery schools, and 2 nursing training classes, with a total of 413 students.
    In the past, the General Association provided very little financial assistance for these businesses, only issuing some medicines and materials. Now some businesses can barely maintain self-sufficiency, while some businesses urgently need economic support.
    Ideological situation: 1. Generally, there is a very strong dependence mentality. The essence of people's organizations is not recognized. This is because in the past, work relied on landlords, warlords, bureaucrats, a small number of ruling classes, and "US aid," not on the people, and there was no mass base. Now that those ruling classes have been overthrown by the people and "US aid" has been exposed by the Chinese people as malicious and cannot be relied upon, they feel that if the People's Government does not support them, they will not be able to work. 2. Some people still believe that the Red Cross Society is a "neutral," "international," and "supra-political" organization, and its work policy should not be bound by the policies of the People's Government. Although criticized, some people still hold this view. 3. Some people believe that the Red Cross Society is a historical and purely medical organization, and its work should be to run some hospitals and clinics in peacetime and organize some rescue teams in wartime. 4. A few people still believe that the Red Cross Society is a charitable organization, managed by a few wealthy people to do some passive work such as famine relief and winter relief. 5. Many branch societies do not understand how to follow the mass line and how to start reorganization. They were confused in the past, but after proposing reorganization, they felt that there were very few ways.
    The above situations embody the fact that the old Chinese Red Cross Society's policy was not oriented to the people and serving the people. It was originally a mass organization but did not go to the masses, so the undertaking became more and more collapsed and less and less vibrant.
    However, the New China Red Cross Society still needs to be built on such an old foundation. Therefore, the sorting out of the old foundation has become the most important task after the establishment of the New China Red Cross Society. The purpose of sorting out is to reverse the incorrect policies of the past. Therefore, the work of sorting out is first and foremost ideological construction. In addition to eliminating those old and wrong ideas, we must also establish a new ideological system and indicate the specific direction and development steps of future work, so that the cause of the New China Red Cross Society can be smoothly promoted without taking too many detours.
            III
    What is the future work direction of the New China Red Cross Society? According to the current social situation in our country, it should be standing on the position of the people, focusing on the people, especially the real needs of workers, peasants, and minority nationalities, referring to the development path of the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, cooperating with the government to promote health work and relief and welfare work, and gradually realize the task of Article 48 of the Common Program. Therefore, the current specific work must be: (1) Reorganize the existing businesses, change from passive to active, and based on these businesses, combine new forces, train health personnel, and carry out maternal and child health care and general medical protection work. In the process of development, special attention should be paid to areas in urgent need of medicine such as industrial and mining areas, rural areas, minority nationality areas, and disaster areas. (2) Organize mobile medical teams, cooperate with government policies, and complete certain political tasks. For example, at present, we should launch and organize medical personnel from various branch societies to form volunteer medical teams to resist US aggression and aid Korea, engage in war wound rescue and refugee medical treatment, etc., and establish medical prevention teams to cooperate with production and disaster relief, river repair projects, and other construction undertakings, promote epidemic prevention, hygiene, and medical work, and combine the people in the areas of the medical prevention teams to create conditions, establish grassroots organizations of the Red Cross Society, and develop association affairs. (3) Under the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, the Red Cross organizations in various places should establish close ties with workers, youth, women, peasants, and other people's organizations, start with organized masses, carry out rescue education and general health knowledge publicity, and then absorb them as members of the Red Cross Society, establish Red Cross organizations, and gradually popularize them to the general people, so that health care work truly becomes a broad mass movement. After these three tasks have been done with considerable effectiveness and laid a foundation, further establish "health stations" and "rescue centers" and other relief and welfare organizations in factories, schools, and rural areas, assisting the government in generally improving the people's health and cultural level. However, in order to ensure that these tasks are carried out on a solid foundation, its development steps should be from small to large, from point to surface, first do a good job in business and then develop association affairs, first reorganize the old organization and then promote the establishment of new organizations, first the government will provide financial subsidies to enrich the business, and then move towards semi-self-sufficiency and full self-sufficiency.
    In summary, the New China Red Cross Society has unlimited prospects for development. In order to ensure that it can complete its assigned tasks, the Red Cross Society's working cadres should resolutely change their past views and practices, and show through their own practical work that they are indeed doing things for the people, so as to seek the masses' change of view on the Red Cross Society and obtain the support of the masses. At the same time, the government should be requested to provide full development conditions—ideological leadership and financial subsidies—in the first few years when the old foundation still needs to be rectified and new businesses are just sprouting. We also hope that domestic democratic parties and people's organizations will provide necessary guidance and assistance.

　　新中国红十字会的工作方向与发展步骤
    中央人民政府卫生部部长  李德全
            一
    中国红十字会于一九五○年八月初由中央人民政府卫生部和中国人民救济总会主持举行的协商会议改组以后，它是变为新中国的红十字会了。依据政务院批准的“中国红十字会会章”的规定，它是在中央人民政府领导下的人民卫生救护团体。其方针是根据“预防为主”的卫生工作总方针，及“动员和组织人民实行自救助人”的救济福利方针，协助各级人民政府，面向人民大众，宣传并推广防疫、卫生、医药及救济福利事业。其任务是：１、团结群众，担任救护训练及宣传公共卫生。２、推动卫生防疫工作，进行医疗服务。３、办理灾害救助及救济性医药卫生工作。４、在必要情形下，经中央人民政府政务院批准担负国际性救助及医疗服务。其目的是协助政府医治战争创伤和消灭灾难，开展群众的卫生运动和救护运动，从而提高人民的卫生文化水平及健康水平，保证国家的经济建设。它的政治基础是根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第四十八条：“提倡国民体育。推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。”他的思想基础是爱国主义、国际主义、和革命的人道主义。这一切综合起来，就构成了新中国红十字会的性质和它今后所应努力的方向。
    这个性质与方向，显然的与旧红十字会是不相同的，因之要将其体现出来，是要经过一番努力的。总会改组已经四个多月，根据这四个多月的工作经验，感觉到新中国红十字会方针原则虽已确定，但今后的具体工作和发展步骤，还不够明确，究竟做那些事？应该怎样做？先从那里着手？都觉得很含糊，因之在指导和布置工作上，就把握不定，所以在这里特提出研究，以求解决。
            二
    我们知道苏联红十字及红新月联合会，于一九一七年十月大革命之后改组，在社会主义指导之下，三十二年来发展是极速极大的。一九二六年会员仅七万五千人，一九三四年会员已有五百万人，卫国战争中会员多至一千二百万人，一九四五年每季增加会员竟达五十万人，现有会员一千七百余万人，拥有分支会二十三万余个。他之所以得到如此发展：第一、是因他的活动是名符其实的群众性的，在政府与人民间起了桥梁的作用。第二、是他对战争残废者、孤儿及儿童们办了不少的救济福利工作，体现了社会主义、人道主义的崇高理想。第三、是他配合几个五年计划为政府分担医药服务事业。第四、是他在改善人民劳动及生活卫生条件和对人民卫生文化水平的提高方面，有了重大价值的贡献。下面列举几个主要事例：１、训练大批人员作急救及健康防护的工作，据统计一九四一年七月至一九四五年七月共有二千二百五十万成年、六百万学校儿童参加训练，现在莫斯科分会就有会员七十万人，有组织的救护队就有二百五十队。２、组织卫生站，检查住宅，公共宿舍，工厂学校，理发所及浴堂宣传卫生常识，减低病患及工业性外伤，协助医务人员从事积极预防工作，据一九四五年统计，此类卫生站共有二十五万四千一百个，战后计划并在每一个集体农场内设立一个医务“中心”。据一九四六年统计，共有一万二千个。３、救济战争残废者、烈、军家属、战争孤儿及办理灾难救济。例如乌克兰红十字会一九四九年办有孤儿院四百十八处，育婴院七十五处，卫国战争残废院六十八处，协助各共和国社会部使百分之八十的残废人员恢复有用的劳动。一九二一年至一九二二年旱灾，在伏尔加河区每日赈济三十万人。一九四四年苏维埃红十字会募集六十万件衣服，三百六十八吨食物和一千四百余万卢布的现款，作为战时救济礼品。总之、苏联红十字会工作是做到组织群众，教育群众，而又为群众服务，不仅将他的会员都训练成为公共卫生员或急救员，同时还直接和间接的训练更多的人，他的总路线是配合着社会主义的建设而向前开展着群众的卫生文化运动。
    旧中国红十字会已有四十六年的历史，他的产生和四十六年的工作，在思想上是遵循了封建主义和资本主义相结合的虚伪的并含有毒素的人道主义，在组织上是历受封建军阀政客官僚反动阶级的把持与控制，因之他虽是群众团体，而并未与群众结合；它虽打着为社会服务的招牌，而所起的作用是冲淡人民对统治者反抗的情绪，甚至做了反动阶级麻醉人民的工具。所以除了在抗日战争特定的历史任务之下，贡献了一些救护成绩以外，他的工作就只能是消极的，被动的，可有可无的，得不到人民的拥护的，因之事业的范围也就越来越小、愈做愈困难了。抗日战争前原有分会五百一十二个，到抗战胜利后加上一些新设的分会，仅有一百九十三个，而到一九五○年八月总会改组后至现在仍与总会有联系的仅八十九个。兹就初步的调查了解，将这些分会现在的会务、业务、与思想情况分述如左：
    （一）会务情况：一般的是停滞状态，没有具体的组织活动。会员大部分无联系，过去虽多到三十八万，但现在有联系的不到一万人，很少缴纳会费。旧理事会还能召开的，不到二十个分会，仅有少数理事维持会务的有四十多个分会，理事会完全解体，仅存在业务机构的有十几个分会。在经济方面，过去靠土地收入维持开支的有四分之一分会（如河南、四川等地区），靠会费及捐款维持开支的约占四分之一，靠业务收入维持开支的约占四分之二。这些分会现在的组成人数约有二千人，理事约占六分之一，医护人员五九六人。
    （二）业务情况：１、医院二十八个，共有病床八百张，每月平均住院人数八百三十人、每月平均门诊人数四万六千六百一十人。２、诊所四十五个，助产站五个，沙眼防治所一个，每月平均门诊人数约六万人。３、医防队五个，每月平均诊治人数一万八千人。４、护士学校二个、助产学校两个，护士训练班两个，共有学生四百一十三人。
    以上这些业务，过去总会在经费方面补助很少，仅发给一些药品材料。现在有些业务可以勉强维持自给自足，有些业务亟待经济上的支援。
    思想情况：１、一般的存在着很浓厚的依赖思想。认不清人民团体的本质，这因为过去工作是依靠地主军阀官僚少数统治阶级及“美援”，不是依靠人民，没有群众基础。现在那些统治阶级已被人民打倒，“美援”亦为中国人民揭穿其恶毒企图而不能依靠，所以觉得如果人民政府不予支持即无法工作。２、部分的人仍认为红十字会是“中立性”的“国际性”的“超政治性”的团体，其工作方针不应受人民政府政策的拘束，虽经过批判，但还有一部分人存在这种思想。３、部分的人认为红十字会是一种有历史性的单纯的医务团体，他的工作平时应该是办些医院和诊所，战时组织一些救护队。４、少数人仍认为红十字会是慈善机构，由少数有钱人主持办理一些像放赈和冬赈之类的消极工作。５、许多分会不了解如何走群众路线，如何下手改组，过去糊里糊涂，提出改组之后却又感到办法很少。
    以上几种情况，就是体现了旧中国红十字会的方针不是面向人民，为人民服务的，本是群众团体却又未到群众中去，所以事业愈来愈垮，愈来愈没有生气。
    但是新中国红十字会是仍要在这样旧的基础上建筑起来。因之对旧有基础之整理，就成为新中国红十字会成立后最首要的任务。整理之目的，是为扭转过去不正确的方针，所以整理的工作首先是思想建设，除了肃清那些旧的错误的思想外，同时还要建立一套新的思想体系，并指示今后工作的具体方向和发展步骤，这样才能使新中国红十字会的事业顺利的推进，不致走太多的弯路。
            三
    新中国红十字会今后的工作方向究竟是怎样呢？根据我国当前的社会情况，应该是站在人民的立场，围绕人民，尤其是工农群众及少数民族的现实需要，参照苏联红十字及红新月联合会的发展道路，配合政府推行卫生工作及救济福利工作，逐步实现共同纲领第四十八条的任务。因此，当前的具体工作，就必须：（一）把现有的业务整顿起来，改被动为主动，并以这些业务为基础，结合新的力量，培养卫生人员并开展妇婴保健及一般医药防护工作，并在发展过程中特别注意工矿、农村、少数民族地区及灾难地区等急需医药的地方。（二）组织机动的医疗队，配合政府政策，完成一定的政治任务。如目前即应发动组织各分会医护人员在自觉自愿的基础上成立抗美援朝志愿医疗队，从事战伤救护及难民医疗等工作，并成立医防队配合生产救灾，修河工程等建设事业，推进防疫卫生及医疗工作，并在医防队的地区结合各地人民，创设条件，建立红十字会基层组织，发展会务。（三）各地红十字会组织在各级人民政府领导下，与工、青、妇、农各人民团体取得密切联系，先从有组织的群众中作起，开展救护教育及一般卫生常识宣传，而后吸收他们为红十字会会员，建立红十字组织，并逐渐普及到一般人民，使卫生保健工作真正成为广大的群众性运动。在这三项工作做有相当成效并打下基础之后，再进一步的在工厂、学校及农村中普遍设立“卫生站”及“救护中心”以及其他救济福利组织，协助政府普遍提高人民的卫生文化水平。但为了保证这些工作在坚实的基础上进行，因此他的发展步骤，应该是由小到大，由点到面，先作好业务而后发展会务，先整顿旧组织而后推设新组织，先由政府给予经费补助，将业务充实之后，而后走向半自给与全自给。
    综合以上所述，新中国红十字会是有无限发展的前途。为求使它确能完成其所负的任务，红十字会工作干部应坚决的改变其过去的看法与作法，以自己的实际工作，表现出确是在为人民做事，借以求得群众对红十字会的改观并得到群众的支援。同时应请求政府在旧的基础尚须整顿，新的业务刚刚发芽的开始几年之内，给予充分的发展条件——思想领导与经费补助。并企望国内各民主党派各人民团体，给予必要的指导与帮助。
