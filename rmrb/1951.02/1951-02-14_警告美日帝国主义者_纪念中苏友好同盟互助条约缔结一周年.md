　　Warning to American and Japanese Imperialists
    Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
　　Guo Moruo

    The first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has arrived.
    After a year of developments in the world situation, the solemn and significant meaning of this treaty is even more prominent today. The friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union are being strengthened day by day. The treaty's central task is to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other states that may unite with Japan in aggression in any form." Today, it seems that Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin's foresight was profound and their preparations thorough.
    Japanese imperialism, with the support of American imperialism, does indeed have a tendency to "resurge." The attempt by American imperialists to separately conclude a peace treaty with the Japanese puppet government is indeed "colluding with Japan in aggressive acts." The question today is whether American and Japanese imperialists are crazy enough to dare to "re-invade."
    The treaty's authority is inviolable. "If one of the contracting parties is attacked by Japan or states allied with Japan, and is thus in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately render military and other assistance with all its strength." The "full strength" of the seven hundred million people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is an unshakable factor in "ensuring world peace and security." The madness of the imperialists is tantamount to digging their own graves.
    Moreover, not only do the people of China and the Soviet Union have a common determination to "ensure world peace and security," but the peace-loving people of the world are also working together for this noble goal. Therefore, as we commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, we must issue a special warning to the American and Japanese imperialists: "Your crimes in poisoning the world are deep enough! If you insist on swiftly bringing about your own destruction, the people of the world will bury you with indignant fury!"

### 警告美日帝国主义者  纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结一周年

　　警告美日帝国主义者        
    纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结一周年
　　郭沫若
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结满一周年了。
    世界局势经过一年的发展，这条约的庄严而重大的意义，在今天是愈加显著了。中苏两国之间的友好与合作，正与日俱进地愈见加强。条约的中心任务在“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其它用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”，在今天看来，更显得毛主席和斯大林大元帅的预见的深远和未雨绸缪的周到。
    日本帝国主义，在美国帝国主义的扶植之下，确实有“再起”的趋势。美国帝国主义者企图与日本傀儡政府单独缔结和约，也确实是正在“在侵略行为上与日本相勾结”。今天的问题就要看美日帝国主义者是不是疯狂到敢于“重新侵略”的地步了。
    条约的威严是不可侵犯的。“一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其它援助”。中苏两大民族七万万人的“全力”，是“确保世界和平与安全”的不可动移的因素。帝国主义者的疯狂，等于是为帝国主义自掘坟墓而已。
    更何况在“确保世界和平与安全”上不仅中苏两国的人民有共同的决心，全世界爱好和平的人民都在为这一崇高的目的而通力合作。因此，我们在纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结一周年的今天，要向美日帝国主义者特别提出一番警告：“你们毒祸世界的罪恶已经够深重了！假如一定要迅速地自取灭亡，全世界的人民会以愤激的怒火来把你们埋葬！”
