　　War Merchant Dulles (Part 1)
　　Wen Sheng
　　The notorious American war merchant Dulles has arrived in Japan to conspire for a separate peace treaty with Japan and to arm Japan. The significance of his trip to Japan is best described by his own words on page four of his book "War or Peace?" published in the spring of 1950:
　　"This is the biggest bet mankind has ever made. I remember when I was a child, I read Stevenson's novel 'The Suicide Club.' The members of the club drew cards every Saturday night, and whoever drew the Ace of Clubs had to kill the member who drew the Ace of Spades within twenty-four hours. I read that novel over and over again with bated breath, and I feel like we are all members of that suicide club now."
　　Indeed, the policies pursued by Dulles, representing American imperialism and its international reactionary lackeys, have indeed made them all members of the "Suicide Club."
　　Without a doubt, Dulles is one of the most important planners of the current US imperialist foreign policy. At the same time, among the decision-makers of the US monopoly capital's foreign policy, his ability is probably the greatest. Although he is not the Secretary of State and is not nominally responsible for implementing foreign policy, he is actually one of the masters of US imperialist foreign policy since the end of World War II. Since he was appointed as an advisor to the US delegation to the San Francisco Conference in 1945, before the end of the war, there has not been an important international conference attended by the United States without Dulles' presence. Although he belongs to the Republican Party and sometimes superficially criticizes the policies of the Truman Democratic administration, that is a means to pressure Truman to submit, and there is no important or fundamental conflict between Truman and Dulles on US imperialist foreign policy.
　　The reason why Dulles has become an important figure in the foreign policy of American imperialism is first because his connections all lead to Wall Street, and through his relationship with Wall Street, he has colluded with the American monopoly capital with international, especially German, reactionary trusts. Secondly, his maternal grandfather was US Secretary of State Foster, who presided over the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in 1893, and his uncle was Lansing, who concluded an agreement with the Japanese imperialist representative Ishii in 1915, recognizing the special status of Japanese imperialism in our Northeast. Not only did Dulles receive imperialist foreign policy education and training from an early age, but his father was a professor at a Presbyterian seminary, which made him grow a mouth that can tell lies, good at reversing right and wrong, turning black into white, and white into black.
　　Let's take a look at Dulles' relationship with Wall Street:
　　He is a director of the International Nickel Co., which is jointly formed by capital from the United States, Britain, and Canada. The company not only controls 80% of the world's nickel consumption but also operates copper, platinum, gold, silver, and other mines. The production of copper within the British Empire is completely monopolized by the company.
　　In addition, Dulles is also a director of important Wall Street financial institutions and enterprises such as American Bank Note Co., American Agricultural Chemical Co., Babcock and Wilcox Co., Bank of New York, and The Fifth Avenue Bank of New York.
　　Because he is a popular figure in Wall Street, Dulles has held many important political and social positions in the United States, implementing the propositions of the reactionary forces he represents in all aspects. As we all know, he is now a senior advisor to the State Department, a representative of the US government to the United Nations General Assembly, and this time he went to Japan with the signboard of Truman's special representative. He has been a US Senator (temporarily appointed, not elected), a member of the New York State Banking Administration, a trustee of the New York City Library, a director of the Rockefeller Foundation, the chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a trustee of the Union Theological Seminary in New York, and the chairman of the Commission on Justice and Durable Peace of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America.
　　However, Dulles' own reactionary activity's headquarters has always been the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm at 48 Wall Street. This notorious law firm, according to its own American reference books, is "the richest and most powerful law firm in New York." The American Steel Company and Anaconda Copper Company of the American financier Morgan, the Mobil Oil Company of Rockefeller, the chemical trust of DuPont, the American Aluminum Company of Mellon, and other huge financial institutions and enterprises, all signed various cartel contracts with international fascist financial groups through Dulles' law firm. The international fascist consortium then hired Dulles' law firm as its legal advisor. Dulles joined Sullivan and Cromwell in 1911, became a formal member of the firm in 1920, and has been the head of the firm since 1944.
　　This Wall Street "richest and most powerful" law firm, headed by Dulles, has made great efforts to support the rise, preparation for war, and launching of aggression by the Hitler Nazi gang. As legal counsel for the German fascist trust I.G. FARBEN and the German fascist financial group J.Henry Shroeder Banking Corp, Dulles obtained US$2 billion in investment from American financiers for the German fascist financiers before the outbreak of World War II. One company of the German steel trust alone obtained US$60 million. Dulles mainly absorbed huge amounts of capital from the United States for the German fascist financiers to prepare for war through Dillon Read and Brown Bros & Harriman, the two largest Wall Street investment institutions. The former was the general manager of the former US Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who suffered from Russophobia and committed suicide by jumping off a building. The latter is the investment company of Harriman, the son of the late American railroad magnate who is now supervising everything in the White House as Truman's special advisor.
　　The German fascist financial group Shroeder Bank has hired Dulles as its legal advisor since its New York branch was established in the United States in 1923 with the help of Percy Rockefeller. The chairman of the New York company is none other than John S. Laylin, who used to work with the current US Secretary of State Acheson in the same Wall Street law firm. Its deputy manager is Robert R. Bogden, the current head of foreign exchange affairs in the US-occupied zone of West Germany, which shows the breadth of Dulles' relationship.
　　The Farben Company is simply an octopus of international trusts. According to a report released by the US Treasury Department at the end of World War II, the total number of companies controlled by Farben in Germany was 380, and the total number of companies it controlled in various countries outside Germany was more than 500. Its world organization network included 93 countries, and it signed more than 2,000 cartel-type contracts with companies in various countries, controlling the world's dyes, medicines, artificial fertilizers, explosives, synthetic petroleum, synthetic rubber, aluminum, magnesium, molded elements, photographic equipment, building materials, synthetic textiles, and other manufacturing industries. The American Mobil Oil Company, General Motors, American Aluminum Company, American Steel Company, and DuPont's chemical trust all have cartel-type contracts with Farben. According to the investigation report of the Kilgore Committee of the US Senate, more than 63,000 of the workers employed by Farben during the war were foreign slave laborers, accounting for about one-third of the company's total number of workers. At the same time, the company also conducted experiments on making poison gas using living people detained in Hitler's concentration camps. Although Farben was such a heinous fascist trust organization that did not blink an eye when killing people, Dulles, as the chairman of the Commission on Justice and Durable Peace of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, has always served as the company's legal advisor.
　　Of course, Dulles' sinful collusion will definitely arouse the attack of people who truly love justice and peace. When Dulles realized that his collusion with international fascism had aroused deep hatred among the American people and hid in the church to carry out activities, a pastor of the American Methodist Church, Smith, wrote an article scolding him like this:
　　"Perhaps some people say it is accidental, but Dulles' law firm has such a close relationship with Shroeder Bank, Farben, and the notorious Alger and Weiss law firm. Dulles is also a director of the International Nickel Company, which was accused by the US government in 1946 of colluding with Farben to monopolize prices and aid Germany in rearming... Now we hear Dulles' voice from the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. He says that the current problem is the problem of the free world opposing the police state, but we cannot help but doubt what kind of world Dulles' so-called free world is?"
　　Dulles not only has close collusion with German fascist financiers, but in 1939 he also represented the Spanish dictator Franco in suing the US government in the US court, demanding that the court award the US government's frozen silver worth US$10 million belonging to the Spanish Republican government to Franco. In 1938, he came to China to discuss "important issues" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In 1932, he represented American investors and attended the international debt conference convened by German fascist financier Dr. Schacht three times in a row. In 1927, he was hired by the Polish fascist government as a consultant to the Polish Currency Stabilization Program Bureau.

　　战争贩子杜勒斯（上）
    闻生
    臭名彰著的美国战争贩子杜勒斯已到日本阴谋进行单独对日媾和和武装日本了。他此次到日本的意义，最好是用他自己在一九五○年春天出版的《战争乎？和平乎？》一书第四页的一段话来描述：
    “这是人类从未下过的最大的赌注。我记得我在童年的时候看过斯蒂芬逊的小说《自杀俱乐部》，该俱乐部的会员，每星期六晚都要抽牌，谁抽到梅花“Ａ”的就得要在二十四小时之内把抽到黑桃“Ａ”的会员杀死。我屏息地把那篇小说读了又读，感觉现在我们大家都好像是那个自杀俱乐部的会员。”
    不错的，杜勒斯所代表的美帝国主义及其国际的反动仆从们所推行的政策，的确已经使他们都成为“自杀俱乐部”的会员了。
    毫无疑义的，杜勒斯是目前美帝外交政策最重要的策划人物之一，同时，在美帝垄断资本的外交政策决策人物之中，他的本领也大概算是最大的了。他虽然不是国务卿，在名义上不负执行外交政策的责任，但实际上他是第二次世界大战以后美帝外交政策的主持人之一，从一九四五年战争还没有结束时他被任命为美国出席旧金山会议代表团的顾问以来，没有一次美国所参加的重要国际会议是没有杜勒斯出席的。他虽然属于共和党，有时候也表面上批评杜鲁门民主党行政当局的政策，但那是用来压迫杜鲁门就范的一种手段，并非杜鲁门与杜勒斯在美帝外交政策上有什么重要的或基本的冲突。
    杜勒斯之所以成为美帝国主义者外交政策的重要人物，首先是因为他的关系是条条都通华尔街的，并且经过他和华尔街的关系，使美国的独占资本与国际的尤其是德国的反动托拉斯勾结起来。其次，他的外祖父就是于一八九三年主持并吞夏威夷群岛的美国国务卿富士特，他的姑丈就是一九一五年与日本帝国主义代表石井缔结协定承认日本帝国主义在我们的东北有特殊地位的蓝辛。杜勒斯不独自小即受到帝国主义外交政策的教养和训练，而且他的父亲是个基督教长老会派的神学院的教授，这使得他自小即长了一只会说鬼话的嘴，善于颠倒是非，把黑说成白，把白说成黑。
    让我们来看看杜勒斯与华尔街的关系罢：
    他是国际镍公司（International Nickel Co.）的董事，这个公司是由美国英国和加拿大三国的资本合组而成的，该公司不独操纵了全世界百分之八十的镍的消费，而且兼营铜、白金、金、银等矿，英帝国国内铜的生产，就是完全由该公司垄断的。
    此外，杜勒斯又是美国钞票公司（American Bank Note Co.）、美国农业化学公司（American Agricnlt ural Chemical Co.）、巴伯克·威尔刻士公司（Babcock and Wilcox Co.）、纽约银行（Bank of New York）、纽约第五街银行（The FifthAvenue Bank of New York）等等华尔街重要金融机构和企业的董事。
    由于他是华尔街的一位红人，杜勒斯乃担任了许多美国政治上和社会上的重要职位，把他所代表的反动势力的主张贯彻到各方面去。众所周知，他现在是国务院的高等顾问、美国政府出席联合国大会的代表，这次到日本去，是挂着杜鲁门的特别代表的招牌的。他做过国会参议员（临时委派的不是选举的），是纽约州银行管理局的局员、纽约市图书馆的理事、洛克菲勒基金的董事、卡尼基国际和平基金的理事长、纽约协和神学院的校董、美国基督教联合会正义与永久和平委员会的主席。
    然而杜勒斯自己的反动活动的大本营，始终是华尔街四十八号的苏里文与克朗威尔律师事务所（Sullivan and Cromwell）。这个臭名远扬的律师事务所，据美国自己的参考书说，是“纽约律师事务所中最富和势力最雄厚的”。美国财阀摩根的美国钢铁公司和安那坎达铜公司、洛克菲勒的美孚油公司、杜邦的化学托拉斯、梅隆的美国铝公司等等庞大金融机构和企业，都是经过杜勒斯的律师事务所与国际法西斯财阀集团订立各种卡特尔合同的，国际法西斯财团则聘请杜勒斯的律师事务所为其法律顾问。杜勒斯于一九一一年起即加入苏里文与克朗威尔律师事务所工作，一九二○年即成为该事务所的正式组合员，自一九四四年以来即担任该事务所的所长。
    以杜勒斯为首的这个华尔街“最富和势力最雄厚”的律师事务所，对于希特勒纳粹匪帮的兴起、准备战争和发动侵略，曾尽了极大的努力加以支持。杜勒斯以德国法西斯托拉斯的法本公司（I.G.FARBEN）和德国法西斯财团的斯劳特银行（J.Henry Shroeder Banking Corp）的法律顾问的资格，在第二次世界大战爆发之前，为德国的法西斯财阀们向美国的财阀们取得了二十亿美元的投资，其中单是德国钢铁托拉斯的一个公司，即取得六千万美元。杜勒斯为德国法西斯财阀从美国吸收巨量的资本以准备战争，主要是经过狄龙——李特公司（Dillon Read）和布朗兄弟及哈里曼公司（Brown Bros ＆ Harriman）那两个华尔街最大的投资机构。前者是那位患了恐苏病而跳楼自杀的前美国国防部长福莱斯特尔当过总经理的，后者是现在以杜鲁门的特别顾问的资格亲在白宫监督一切的已故美国铁路大王的儿子哈里曼的投资公司。
    德国法西斯财团的斯劳特银行，自一九二三年得到柏西·洛克菲勒（Percy Rockefeller）之助在美国成立了纽约的分公司以来，就一直聘请杜勒斯为其法律顾问。该纽约公司的理事长；不是别人，就是曾与现在美国国务卿艾奇逊同在一间华尔街律师事务所共事的雷林（John S.Laylin），它的副经理，就是现任西德美军占领区主管外汇事宜的波格登（Robert R.Bogden），由此更可见杜勒斯的关系之广了。
    法本公司简直是国际托拉斯的章鱼。据美国财政部在二次大战结束时发表的报告称，在法本公司控制下的德国国内的公司共有三百八十家，其所控制在德国以外各国的公司共五百余家，其世界的组织网共包括九十三个国家，它与各国的公司一共签订了二千多种的卡特尔性质的合同，控制了世界上染料、药品、人造肥料、炸药、人造石油、人造橡胶、铝、镁、成形素、照相器材、建造器材、人造纺织品等等制造工业。美国的美孚油公司、通用汽车公司、美国铝矿公司、美国钢铁公司以及杜邦的化学托拉斯，都与法本公司签有卡特尔性质的合同。据美国参院的基尔哥尔委员会的调查报告，法本公司在战时所雇用的工人之中，有六万三千名以上都是外国的奴隶劳工，约占该公司全部工人数目的三分之一。同时，该公司又曾在希特勒的集中营里实行过拿被拘禁的活人来作制造毒气的试验。法本公司虽然是这么一个杀人不眨眼的罪恶满盈的法西斯托拉斯组织，但是作美国基督教联合会的正义与永久和平委员会主席的杜勒斯，竟一直充任该公司的法律顾问。
    当然，杜勒斯这种罪恶的勾当，是一定会引起真正爱好正义与和平的人士的攻击的。当杜勒斯自知其与国际法西斯的勾结关系已引起美国人民的深刻痛恨而躲藏在教会之内活动时，美国美以美教会的一位牧师斯密士即曾这样写文章痛骂过他：
    “也许有人说是偶然的，但杜勒斯的律师事务所与斯劳特银行、法本公司以及臭名显著的阿尔技与威士的克律师事务所的关系是如此密切。杜勒斯又是国际镍公司的董事，这个公司曾于一九四六年被美国政府控告以前有与法本公司勾结垄断价格和援助德国重行武装的罪行……现在我们从美国基督教联合会那里听到杜勒斯的声音了，他说目前的问题是自由世界反对警察国家的问题，但是我们不能不怀疑，杜勒斯的所谓自由世界究竟是怎样的世界？”
    杜勒斯不仅与德国法西斯财阀有密切的勾结，一九三九年他还代表西班牙独裁者佛朗哥向美国法院起诉——控告美国政府，要求法院将被美政府冻结的属于西班牙共和政府的价值一千万美元的白银判归佛朗哥所有。一九三八年他曾到中国来与蒋介石匪帮密商“重要问题”。一九三二年，他代表美国的投资者一连三次出席德国法西斯财阀沙赫特博士召集的国际债务会议。一九二七年，他应波兰法西斯政府之聘，担任波兰稳定币制计划局的顾问。
