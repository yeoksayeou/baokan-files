Cultural Life Trends

　　Various regions prepare to turn winter schools into year-round people's schools
    According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast, Northwest, East China, North China, and Henan and Hubei provinces, the number of students enrolled in winter schools in various regions has reached over 10,086,000. Shandong Province alone has reached 2,000,000. In order to meet the needs of farmers for regular cultural learning and to consolidate the achievements of farmers' spare-time education, the cultural and educational departments of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces have instructed that winter schools with good conditions should, under the principles of not hindering production and voluntary participation by the masses, strive to transform seasonal winter schools into regular farmers' spare-time schools or literacy groups. In order to encourage outstanding cadres, teachers, and students in winter schools, and to lay the foundation for year-round learning, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has specially formulated methods for rewarding model winter schools, instructing all districts in the suburbs of Beijing to conduct a model selection work when winter schools are transformed into people's schools.

　各地准备把冬学转为常年民校
    据东北、西北、华东、华北及河南、湖北等地不完全资料的统计，各地冬学入学人数已达一千零八十六万余。仅山东一省即达二百万人。陕西、甘肃二省文教厅为满足农民经常学习文化的要求和巩固农民业余教育已有成绩，已指示条件优良的冬学在不妨碍生产和群众自愿的原则下，尽量争取把季节性的冬学转为经常性的农民业余学校或识字组。北京市文教局为鼓励冬学中成绩优良的干部、教员和学员，奠定常年学习的基础，特制订冬学奖励模范办法，指示京郊各区在冬学转民校时，进行一次评选模范的工作。
