    Yanbei Prefecture of Chahar Province Convenes Meeting to Establish Measures to Improve Safety Work in Private Small Coal Kilns

    To the Editors:

    The issue of safe production has not been completely resolved in the private small coal kilns of Yanbei, especially since the winter of last year, when casualties became even more serious. According to statistics, last year saw a total of 44 worker deaths, 9 serious injuries, and 45 minor injuries, totaling 98. In response to the criticism raised in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily, the Yanbei Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting on January 29th, gathering responsible individuals from the mining areas of Hunyuan, Lingqiu, Shuoxian, and Youyu to inspect the issue of safe production and establish measures for improvement.

    The reasons for the serious casualties are primarily: (1) Leading personnel in the mining areas exhibit bureaucratic work styles, failing to prioritize safety work and being satisfied with mere arrangements and plans, lacking timely inspections, which has rendered the safety institutions mere formalities. Many mining cadres are complacent about safety work, believing that deaths in the mines are unavoidable, and have not actively strengthened safety efforts.

    (2) Capitalists only seek immediate benefits and lack long-term planning. For example, when the administrative leadership of Yuanbaozi Mine proposed strengthening fire prevention equipment, the capitalist disagreed, deeming it too expensive. In the Dujiagou Bushanzi Kiln, the mine inspection revealed that the roof was unstable and needed immediate repair. However, the kiln's capitalist did not adopt the recommendation, resulting in the death of two workers. Some kiln owners also lack confidence in their operations, leading to even poorer performance in safety equipment and work. These problems urgently require the governments of each mining area to strengthen education for the capitalists of private small coal kilns, earnestly implement the policy of "benefit for both labor and capital, consideration for both public and private interests," and strengthen safety work in the mines.

    (3) There is a lack of strict education on labor discipline for workers. Safety work has not been transformed into a mass movement, leading to continuous accidents. Therefore, the meeting determined that education on safe production must be implemented in 1951. Only by doing a good job in safety work can we have the conditions to complete and improve production. Therefore, we have decided to improve the following tasks in the future:

    (1) Establish a dedicated safety responsibility system and implement regular inspections. Conduct small inspections every half month and large inspections every quarter. In addition, based on the specific conditions of each area, adopt irregular key inspections, such as preventing roof collapses in spring due to loose soil and preventing suffocation in summer due to hot weather and poor ventilation.

    (2) Reorganize and consolidate safety organizations. Ineffective organizations should be rectified to improve their work. Mines that have not yet established safety organizations should establish them quickly.

    (3) Conscientiously implement the Provisional Regulations for Mine Area Management and the Provisional Safety Regulations. In addition to requiring all private small coal kilns in the Hunyuan mining area to apply for government approval and submit drawings, other mining areas should ensure that one-fourth of the kilns submit drawings and apply for approval from the provincial government, and improve one-half of the "one-eyed wells" to allow for natural ventilation.

### 察省雁北专署召开会议订出办法　改进私营小窑保安工作

    察省雁北专署召开会议订出办法
　　改进私营小窑保安工作
    编辑同志：
    安全生产的问题在雁北各私营小窑中还没有得到彻底解决，特别是去年入冬以来伤亡事故更加严重。据统计：去年全年死亡工人四十四名，重伤九名，轻伤四十五名，总计九十八名。人民日报“读者来信”栏曾对这个问题提出批评，雁北专署于一月二十九日召集浑源、灵邱、朔县、右玉等矿区负责人举行会议，对安全生产问题进行检查，并作出了改进的办法。
    造成严重伤亡事故的原因，主要是：（一）矿区领导人员存在官僚主义作风，对保安工作不重视，对工作满足于布置、计划；缺少及时的检查，使保安机构流于形式。不少矿务干部对保安工作，思想上麻痹，认为：窑下不能不死人。没有积极去加强保安工作。
    （二）资方只图眼前利益，不做长远打算。如元堡子矿行政领导上提议加强防火设备，而资方不同意，认为花钱太多。杜家沟布衫子窑，经矿方检查，提出：顶棚不牢，应赶快修建。但该窑资方不采纳，结果压死工人两名。还有的窑主对经营没信心，因而对保安设备工作做得更差。这些问题都急待各矿区政府对私营小窑资方加强教育，认真贯彻“劳资两利，公私兼顾”的政策，加强窑下的保安工作。
    （三）对工人缺乏严格的劳动纪律的教育。没有把保安工作变成群众性的运动，以致事故不断发生。因此，会议上确定：一九五一年必须贯彻安全生产的教育。只有搞好安全工作，才有条件完成与搞好生产。因此今后我们决定搞好以下几项工作：
    （１）建立安全专责制，实行定期检查。每半月小检查一次，每一季大检查一次。此外，根据各处具体情况，采取不定期的重点检查，如春季土松容易发生冒顶，夏季天热通风不良易发生闷气等，必须及早预防。
    （２）整理与巩固保安组织。不起作用的组织要加以整顿，把工作提高一步。尚未建立安全组织的矿井，应很快的建立起来。
    （３）认真执行矿区管理暂行条例及保安暂行规程。除浑源矿区私营小窑要全部申请政府批准与绘图外，其他矿区要做到四分之一的窑要绘图申请报省府批准，将二分之一的独眼井改进能自然通风。
