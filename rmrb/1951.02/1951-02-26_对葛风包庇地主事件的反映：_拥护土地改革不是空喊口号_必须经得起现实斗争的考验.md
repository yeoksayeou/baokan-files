　　Reflections on the Ge Feng Landlord Protection Incident:
  　Supporting Land Reform is Not Just Empty Talk
    It Must Withstand the Test of Real Struggle
    Comrade Editor:
    The People's Daily's February 9th report and commentary on Ge Feng's protection of landlords was indeed a very good education for a revolutionary worker like myself who comes from a landlord family. It has made me understand further that those who have close emotional ties with landlord families must be extremely vigilant and stand firm in the midst of the fierce struggle of land reform. At the same time, it has made me realize further that supporting land reform is not just empty talk, but must be tested on issues related to one's own vital interests. That is, when the land and houses of one's own feudal family are confiscated, when one's parents, who are landlords, use the private feelings between father and son to resist land reform and clamor against it, we must be able to adopt a firm revolutionary stance and revolutionary attitude of supporting land reform. To achieve this, I think it is very necessary to conscientiously study various policies and decrees related to land reform and to be vigilant at all times.

　　对葛风包庇地主事件的反映：
  　拥护土地改革不是空喊口号
    必须经得起现实斗争的考验
    编辑同志：
    二月九日人民日报刊载关于葛风包庇地主的报道和短评，对于我这样一个地主家庭出身的革命工作人员，确系一次很好的教育。它使我更进一步地懂得了，在感情上与地主家庭有着密切联系的人，在土地改革激烈的斗争中必须严加警惕，站稳立场；同时也使我更进一步地认识到，拥护土地改革不是空喊口号，而是要在与自己切身利益有关的问题上来考验。就是要在自己的封建家庭的土地房屋被没收的时候，在自己的地主成份的父母亲利用父子的私情来进行抗拒土地改革叫嚣的时候，我们要能够采取坚决的拥护土地改革的革命立场与革命态度。要做到这一点，我想，认真地学习各种有关土地改革的政策与法令，时时提高警惕是很必要的。
