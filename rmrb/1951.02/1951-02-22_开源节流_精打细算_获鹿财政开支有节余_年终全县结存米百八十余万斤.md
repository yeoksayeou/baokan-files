　　Open Source and Reduce Expenditure, Careful Budgeting
　  Huolu County Has a Fiscal Surplus
　  Year-End County Savings Exceed 1.8 Million Jin of Rice
    [Report from this newspaper] In 1950, the financial work of Huolu County, Hebei Province, under the correct grasp of the principles of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, careful calculation and not affecting supply, has completely achieved a balance of payments. At the end of 1950, the county had a surplus of 1,861,108 jin of rice, which laid a solid foundation for sound financial work in the future.
    The county's local financial work last year was carried out under the unified leadership of the County Finance Management Committee. When preparing the financial expenditure budget last year, due to the lack of a realistic spirit among county-level department cadres, the idea of ​​"being generous in budgeting and thrifty in spending" was produced. For example, the average teacher's salary was originally 165 jin, but it was increased to 200 jin in the budget; the grain loss figures were even larger in the budget, with each 100 jin estimated to lose 2 jin. Therefore, the county's total expenditure budget reached 4,119,296 jin, but the total revenue of the county's land grain surtax was only 4,689,800 jin. After deducting 817,000 jin for the special district, the budget surplus was 246,496 jin, which violated the principle of saving expenditure and balancing revenue and expenditure. After tightening, the final expenditure budget for the year was determined to be 2,471,861 jin (excluding the task of remittance to higher authorities). By the end of the year, a total of 2,180,107 jin was spent (including 425,000 jin remitted to higher authorities), with a surplus of 1,861,108 jin, achieving guaranteed supply and a balance of payments.
    The reason for the above achievements is, first of all, that through ideological education, cadres in various departments have established the idea of ​​"dealing with oneself for the public" and "dealing with small things for big things," overcoming difficulties and practicing thrift. For example, in April last year, in order to eliminate waste, the office expenses of schools and village governments at all levels were changed to in-kind supply, and purchases were made according to actual needs, thus saving more than 5,000 jin of millet per month.
    The second is to strengthen grain storage and reduce damage. This is also an important key to saving expenditure. The county has a total of nine administrative districts. In the past, in order to facilitate the collection and distribution of public grain, each district set up a warehouse. As a result, manpower was scattered, grain storage was very poor, some were even borrowed at will, and grain losses in each warehouse were mostly more than 10,000 jin. After the reorganization of the grain depot district in June last year, the dispersed one-district-one-depot was changed to one large depot and two small depots, and cadres were appropriately equipped to strengthen the grain storage system, timely ventilate and turn over the grain to reduce mold and rot, and eliminate theft and unauthorized borrowing. Over the past year, no losses have basically occurred in any warehouse.
    In addition, clearing public property can also increase national income to reduce expenditure. In the past, the county's management of public property was rough and careless, and individual financial cadres even had a concept of favoritism, not managing public houses, and allowing both public and private individuals to live in them at will, affecting fiscal revenue. After the clearing last year, all public properties, regardless of public or private occupation, were all contracted and rents were negotiated. Last year, a total of 23,062 jin of rice was recovered in rent.
    Due to the above measures, coupled with other income, the total income for the year increased by 309,083 jin of rice; at the same time, various expenditures were tightened again and again, so the county's fiscal revenue and expenditure last year not only achieved balance, but also had a surplus.

　　开源节流·精打细算
　  获鹿财政开支有节余
　  年终全县结存米百八十余万斤
    【本报讯】河北获鹿县一九五○年的财政工作，在正确掌握节流开源、精打细算和不影响供给的原则下，已完全作到收支平衡，一九五○年年终全县并结存米一百八十六万一千一百零八斤，因此也打下了今后健全的财政工作的坚固基础。
    该县去年地方财政工作，是在县财政管理委员会统一领导下进行的。去年在造报财政开支预算时，由于县级部门干部缺乏实事求是的精神，曾产生“宽打窄用”的思想，如教员薪金原平均一百六十五斤，预算时增至二百斤；粮食损耗数字预算更大，每百斤竟估计要损耗二斤。因此，全县开支预算高达四百一十一万九千二百九十六斤，但地粮附征全县总收入也不过四百六十八万九千八百斤，除专区提成八十一万七千斤外，预算出超二十四万六千四百九十六斤，以此执行实违反了节约开支，收支平衡的原则。后经紧缩，最后确定全年开支预算为二百四十七万一千八百六十一斤（不包括上解任务）。至年终结算，共开支二百一十八万零一百零七斤（包括上解四十二万五千斤），结存一百八十六万一千一百零八斤，作到了保证供给，和收支平衡。
    能有以上这些成绩的原因，首先是通过思想教育，使各部门的干部树立了“以公涉己”和“以小涉大”的思想，克服了困难，厉行了节约。如去年四月，为杜绝浪费，各级学校及村政府办公费改为实物供给，根据实际需要，用啥买啥，因此每月节支小米五千余斤。
    其次是，加强粮食保管，减少伤耗。这也是节约支出的重要关键。该县共九个行政区，以前为领发公粮方便，每区设立一个仓库。因此人力分散，粮食保管很差，有的甚至随便借用，各库粮食损耗多在万斤以上。去年六月粮库调整区划后，由分散的一区一库，改为一大库两小库，并适当配备了干部，加强了粮食的保管制度，及时过风翻晒，减少了霉烂，杜绝了偷盗损失和私自挪借的现象。一年来，各库基本上没有发生任何损耗现象。
    此外，清查公产，亦可增加国家收入，以减少开支。过去该县对公产管理，粗枝大叶，个别财政干部甚至存有恩赐观念，对公家房屋，不加管理，无论公私都可以随便居住，影响财政收入。去年进行清查后，一切公产，不论公私占用，一律订立契约，议定租价，去年一年共收回租金折米两万三千零六十二斤。
    由于采取了以上各项措施，加上其他收入，全年增加收入折米三十万九千零八十三斤；同时各项开支一再紧缩，因此该县去年财政收支不但达到平衡，而且有了节余。
