　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government

　  Decision on Implementing Mandatory Property Insurance for State Organs, State-Owned Enterprises, and Cooperatives, and Mandatory Passenger Insurance
    I. In order to protect state property from losses due to unexpected disasters, and to ensure that passengers who suffer accidental injuries receive compensation, it is decided to implement mandatory insurance for the property of state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives above the county level (or above the district level in cities), as well as for passengers traveling by train, ship, and airplane.
    II. The People's Insurance Company of China is designated as the legal organ for handling mandatory insurance. In addition to collecting fees and providing compensation according to regulations, the People's Insurance Company of China shall take active disaster prevention measures and be responsible for regularly inspecting and guiding the disaster prevention equipment of insured units. All insured units must accept this advice and actively improve their disaster prevention equipment. The People's Insurance Company of China shall also extract a portion of the insurance premium income to assist in improving urban public fire-fighting equipment and public safety equipment for transportation, focusing on key areas.
    III. The expenses incurred by state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives due to insurance shall be included in the budget for reimbursement or included in cost calculations. Passenger accident insurance shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of railways, ships, and airplanes to handle the insurance on behalf of passengers. After the promulgation of this decision, if any state property that should be insured suffers disaster losses due to failure to implement insurance, the responsible person of the competent department shall be subject to strict punishment.
    IV. Various insurance regulations and insurance premium rates shall be formulated by the People's Insurance Company of China and implemented after being approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

　　中央人民政府政务院
　  关于实行国家机关、国营企业、合作社财产强制保险及旅客强制保险的决定
    一、为保障国家财产不因意外灾害而遭受损失，以及遭受意外伤害的旅客能够得到补偿起见，决定对国家机关、国营企业和县以上（城市则为区以上）合作社的财产，以及搭乘火车、轮船、飞机的旅客，实行强制保险。
    二、指定中国人民保险公司为办理强制保险的法定机关。中国人民保险公司除照章收费赔偿外，应进行积极的防灾措施，负责对投保单位经常进行防灾设备的检查与指导；各投保单位则须接受此建议，积极改善其防灾设备；并由中国人民保险公司提取保险费收入之一部，有重点的协助改善城市的公共消防设备，与交通上的公共安全设备。
    三、国家机关、国营企业及合作社因保险而支出的费用，准编入预算报销，或列入成本计算。旅客意外伤害保险，则由铁路、轮船、飞机的主管机关，负责代为投保。自本决定公布后，所有应行保险的国家财产，如因未实行投保，致遭受灾害无所取偿时，该主管部门负责人应受严格处分。
    四、各种保险条例及保险费率，由中国人民保险公司拟订，经政务院财政经济委员会核准后施行之。
