　　Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The Second National Aquatic Products Conference was held in Beijing from January 20th to 30th. The main purpose of this conference was to summarize the national aquatic products work of 1950, to arrange the aquatic products production tasks for major administrative regions and provinces and cities across the country in 1951, and to discuss and resolve the organizational issues of more than 1.2 million fishermen nationwide, as well as issues related to the production and marketing of fish, the organization of aquatic products agencies of governments at all levels, and the management of fish markets and national public and private aquatic products enterprises.

　　After eleven days of repeated discussions, the conference determined that the national aquatic products production policy for 1951 would still focus on recovery, striving to restore production to 1.5 million tons, which was the pre-war level, within two years. The national aquatic products production target for 1951 was set at 1.1 million tons, an increase of 21% compared to 1950. The assigned tasks for major administrative regions and provinces and cities are: East China Region 500,000 tons, Central South Region 360,000 tons, Northeast Region 140,000 tons, Hebei Province and Tianjin City 100,000 tons.

　　The conference began with an opening speech by Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, followed by a summary report on the national aquatic products work of 1950 by Gao Shuyi, Director of the Aquatic Products Department of the Ministry. They both pointed out that, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the national aquatic products industry has achieved considerable recovery in the past year and has exceeded the production targets set by the First National Fisheries Conference in February of last year. The total national fish production last year was more than 911,000 tons, exceeding the original plan of more than 730,000 tons by 24%, thus guaranteeing the livelihoods of more than 1.2 million fishermen nationwide.

　　Why were such achievements made? Wu Juenong, Vice Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his summary report to the conference that the fundamental reason was that various regions had concretely implemented the guidelines and policies stipulated by the Central People's Government in the execution of their tasks, and had carried out the following series of effective measures: First, major administrative regions and provincial people's governments across the country have established aquatic products administrative agencies. Aquatic products administrative agencies below the provincial level are also being gradually established, thus providing leadership for aquatic products work. Second, in addition to the existing Guandong Aquatic Products Company, state-owned aquatic products enterprises have taken over and reorganized the Shanghai and Shandong Aquatic Products Companies, restored major fish markets in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Yantai, established the Northeast Marketing and Sales Joint Company and the Shandong and Northern Jiangsu Marketing and Sales Companies, and allocated more than 4 billion yuan worth of state-owned enterprise materials, equivalent to an investment of more than 4.3 million catties of millet, laying a preliminary business foundation for state-owned aquatic products enterprises. Private aquatic products enterprises have also been restored with the support of loans from local people's governments. Third, aquatic products agencies in various regions have assisted fishermen in establishing more than 450 fishermen's cooperatives in various fishing areas, effectively helping the production work of fishermen. Fourth, the establishment of fish markets in various regions has weakened and reduced the intermediate exploitation of fish merchants. Moreover, the distribution of fish and salt has stimulated the aquatic products processing business, enabling fish prices to consistently maintain the standard of one catty of fish for one catty of grain throughout the past year.

　　However, due to the fact that more than 90% of China's fisheries production is operated by scattered individual fishermen, and the unsoundness of previous aquatic products marketing and sales institutions, distribution was poor which impeded production. Therefore, the conference believes that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the 1951 production tasks, the following work must be done this year: First, vigorously organize fishermen, assist fishermen in organizing mutual aid groups and cooperatives, etc., to guide individual fishermen towards the path of mutual assistance and cooperative collective production. Second, organize the marketing and sales of fish products in a planned manner. The conference resolved that major administrative regions should transfer cadres to organize joint aquatic products marketing and sales organizations to plan the marketing and sales of aquatic products in a unified manner. At the same time, encourage and develop the aquatic products processing industry. Third, strengthen the business management of state-owned aquatic products enterprises. Fourth, strengthen the management of fish markets in various regions. Existing aquatic products refrigeration equipment in various regions should be taken over by aquatic products departments and used reasonably. Fifth, aquatic products administrative agencies at all levels should strengthen investigation and research work in order to understand the overall situation of aquatic products resources in various regions.

　　More than 110 people attended the conference, including representatives from aquatic products agencies of the People's Governments of the Northeast Region, East China Region, Central South Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin City, representatives of fishermen, representatives of aquatic products enterprises, representatives of aquatic products educators, and guests from relevant units of the Central People's Government.

　　第二届全国水产会议闭幕
    规定今年生产任务解决渔民组织问题
    【新华社三十一日讯】第二届全国水产会议，已于一月二十日至三十日在北京举行。这次会议的目的主要在总结一九五○年的全国水产工作，布置一九五一年全国各大行政区、各省市的水产生产任务、和讨论并解决全国一百二十多万渔民的组织问题，鱼货产销问题。各级人民政府水产机构的组织问题，以及鱼市场和全国公私营水产企业的管理等问题。
    会议经过十一天的反复讨论，确定在一九五一年内全国的水产生产方针仍以恢复为主，争取在两年内恢复至战前产量一百五十万吨。一九五一年的全国水产生产任务确定为一百一十万吨，较一九五○年提高产量百分之二十一。各大行政区及各省、市的分配任务是：华东区五○万吨，中南区三十六万吨，东北区十四万吨，河北省和天津市十万吨。
    会议首先由中央人民政府农业部部长李书城致开幕词，由该部水产处处长高树颐向大会作一九五○年全国水产工作的总结报告。他们一致指出，由于中央人民政府的正确领导，在去年一年内，全国的水产事业已得到相当的恢复，并超额完成了去年二月第一届全国渔业会议所规定的生产任务。总计去年全国共产鱼九十一万一千多吨，超过原订计划七十三万多吨的百分之二十四。使全国一百二十多万渔民的生活因此得到保障。
    为什么会有这样的成绩呢？中央人民政府农业部副部长吴觉农在大会总结报告中指出，其基本原因是由于各地区在执行任务时具体地实现了中央人民政府所规定的方针和政策，进行了以下一系列的有力措施：第一，全国各大行政区和各省人民政府均建立了水产行政机构。省级以下的水产行政机构也在逐渐建立。因而使水产工作有了领导。第二，国营水产企业，除原有的关东水产公司外，接管并整顿了上海、山东两个水产公司，恢复了上海、青岛、烟台等主要鱼市场，创办了东北运销联合公司和山东、苏北两运销公司，并调拨国营企业物资作价四十多亿元，共投资小米四百三十多万斤，初步奠定了国营水产企业的业务基础。私营水产企业也在各地人民政府的贷款扶持下得到恢复。第三，各地水产机构协助渔民在各渔区建立渔民合作社四百五十多处，有效地帮助了渔民的生产工作。第四，各地鱼市场的建立，削弱和减轻了渔行的中间剥削。并由于渔盐的配放，刺激了水产加工业务，使去年一年间鱼价能经常保持斤鱼斤粮的标准。
    但是，由于我国渔业的生产百分之九十以上都是由分散的个体渔民所经营，和以往水产运销机构的不健全，致造成运销不畅，阻碍了生产的不正常现象。因此，会议认为要保证一九五一年生产任务的顺利完成，必须在今年做好以下工作：第一，大力组织渔民，协助渔民组织渔业互助组、合作社等，以引导个体渔民走向互助、合作的集体生产的道路。第二，有计划地组织鱼产运销。会议决议由各大行政区抽调干部组织联合水产运销机关，统一筹划水产的运销工作。同时，鼓励并发展水产加工工业。第三，加强国营水产企业的业务管理。第四，加强各地鱼市场的管理。各地现有水产冷藏设备，应由水产部门接管，合理使用。第五，各级水产行政机构应加强调查研究工作，以便了解各区水产资源的全面情况。
    出席这次会议的有东北区、华东区、中南区、河北省和天津市等地区人民政府水产机构代表，渔民代表，水产企业代表，水产教育工作者代表及中央人民政府各有关单位来宾共一百一十多人。
