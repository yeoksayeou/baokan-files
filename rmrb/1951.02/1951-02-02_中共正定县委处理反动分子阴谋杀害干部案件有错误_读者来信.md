To the Editor:

　　In August of this year, I went to the sixth district of Zhengding, Hebei, to collect materials for creative writing. Soon after arriving in the district, I heard cadres talking about the counter-revolutionary landlords and rich peasants of Nan Shijiazhuang village in that district conspiring to assassinate village cadres and seize militia firearms. I asked them how this matter had been handled. They said it had already been dealt with, and the county had sent people to investigate and found nothing. Later, I read the district committee's report to the county, and learned some information from other sources, and found that the county and district leaders handled this issue inappropriately. I would like to raise this issue to alert the Zhengding County Committee, public security organs, and other local comrades to pay attention and be vigilant.

　　The course of events was as follows: In April of last year, Dong Qingxiang (a rich peasant, a member of the Big Sword Society, and also a former soldier who deserted; at the time he was the village's industrial commissioner) of Nan Shijiazhuang village, Zhengding, colluded with poor peasant Zhang Nianzi (because Zhang Nianzi had grievances against individual village cadres) to conspire to assassinate cadres such as Lü Gachen of the village. At that time, Dong Qingkui (a rich peasant who had served in the puppet police in Zhengding city) also participated in this assassination conspiracy. Soon, Zhang Nianzi became a militiaman. Dong Qingxiang then told Nianzi that they had a total of twelve people, with one rifle and one pistol, kept at the home of Zhang Baoqi (a landlord, former head of the Big Sword Society and puppet Bao chief, and also a former soldier in the Chiang Kai-shek army). Later, Dong Qingkui also proposed to strike within two weeks, and planned to first seize the guns from the militia squadron headquarters. But on August 8, Dong Qingxiang realized that the guard at the squadron headquarters was tight, so he told Nianzi not to contact them anymore. Based on this situation, militia squadron leaders Zhao Bei and Dai Xigui (both Communist Party members) decided to arrest them immediately to prevent these bad elements from escaping. Zhao Bei and others consulted with Hao Chengde, the secretary of the village's Communist Party branch. Hao Chengde repeatedly instructed Zhao Bei and others to handle the matter cautiously, and not to beat or scold people in violation of policy. Zhao and Dai then led the militia to arrest Dong Qingxiang and Dong Qingkui separately. Dong Qingkui was not at home, so they only caught Dong Qingxiang and tied him up at the squadron headquarters. After arriving at the headquarters, Zhao Bei and the public security officer interrogated Dong Qingxiang about the assassination plot. Dong admitted to having attended meetings and said that there were two guns at Zhang Baoqi's house. The militia then tied up Zhang Baoqi as well. But Zhang Baoqi firmly denied it. Zhao Bei then poked him four times with a gun, and Zhang eventually confessed. At that time, Zhao Bei and others reported to the district committee. The district committee said to them, "You don't have arrest warrants, you are arbitrarily tying up people, and setting up private courts. This is illegal." And criticized them. After Zhao Bei returned to the village, he told Hao Chengde about this matter and hurried to release Zhang and Dong, and apologized to them. The district reported the situation to the county. The county armed forces department then sent people to investigate the village. After the investigation, they said, "There is nothing to this matter." Because the village cadres, after being criticized, tried their best to minimize the situation and did not explain the true nature of the matter to the county committee. The district committee decided to give Zhao Bei a public warning, and others were given criticism. But the district did not deal with the activities of the reactionary landlords, only saying that the district would provide ideological education and control.

　　On August 30, a reader's voice was published in the supplement of the Shijiazhuang Daily, criticizing the village cadres for detaining and beating people. It distorted the facts, saying that it was because Dong Qingxiang wanted to set up a patrol group and mentioned that Zhang Baoqi (the newspaper wrote it as Zhang Baoqi) used to have guns at his home, which caused the trouble. Obviously, the bad guys are taking advantage of the deviations in our implementation of policies to deliberately attack active and responsible party member cadres. However, the Zhengding County Committee did not pay attention to the suspicion of this "voice," but blindly pressed the district to continue investigating the facts of the village cadres beating and tying up people. On the evening of September 1, the district committee went to the village to hold a branch meeting, explaining that everyone's active work was good, but the methods were simple and violating policies was wrong. And inspired everyone to frankly tell the truth of the matter. Comrade Zhao Bei then reported the detailed process of the case. Based on this situation, the district wrote a "Report on the Incident of Party Member Cadres Tying and Beating People in Nan Shijiazhuang Village, Sixth District." The matter ended there. Until I returned to Beijing at the end of October, I had not seen any sanctions imposed on these bad elements by the county's public security and judicial organs. At that time, I also raised an opinion to the district committee, asking if their handling of this matter constituted the mistake of "boundless leniency." They believed that since the matter had been handed over to the higher authorities for handling, they should no longer be responsible. Some even believed that "it is normal for landlords to want to counterattack, there is nothing to it." As for whether it was handled after November, I do not know. But I believe that the handling of this incident by the Zhengding County and District cadres was very inappropriate. They one-sidedly understood the policy, only seeing the village cadres arbitrarily detaining and beating people, but ignoring the criminal behavior of the counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, I suggest that the Zhengding Public Security and Judicial Organs should quickly investigate the truth of the illegal landlords' conspiracy to sabotage activities, and then give them the appropriate sanctions; and on this basis, they should check the implementation of the State Council and the Supreme People's Court's instructions to severely punish counter-revolutionary activities, so as to avoid similar situations from happening again.

### 中共正定县委处理反动分子阴谋杀害干部案件有错误  读者来信

　　中共正定县委处理反动分子阴谋杀害干部案件有错误           
    读者来信
    编辑同志：
    今年八月间，我到河北正定六区去搜集创作材料。到区上不久，就听到区干部们谈论该区南石家庄村反动地主富农阴谋暗杀村干部夺取民兵枪枝的事情。我问他们此事怎样处理的。他们说已经处理了。县里也派人调查过了，没有什么事了。后来，我看了该区区委会给县里的汇报，又从别的地方了解到一些材料，发现该县县区领导上处理这一问题是很不妥当的。我愿将这一问题提出，以提起正定县委，与公安机关及其他地方工作同志的注意与警惕。
    事情的经过是这样的：去年四月间，正定南石家庄村董庆祥（富农成份，进过大刀会，也参加过部队，后开小差回家。当时为该村实业委员。）约贫农张年子（因张年子对该村个别干部有意见）阴谋暗杀该村吕戛臣等干部。当时还有董庆魁（富农成份，曾在正定城内当过伪警备队）参加这一阴谋暗杀活动。不久，张年子当了民兵。董庆祥又告诉年子说，他们一伙共有十二人。有一枝大枪、一枝手枪，放在张保祺（地主成份，当过大刀会会长和伪保长，并参加过蒋匪军）家里。后来董庆魁又提出了要在两星期以内下手，并准备先下民兵中队部的枪。但到八月八日，董庆祥发觉中队部站岗很紧，就告诉年子说不要再联系了。民兵正副中队长赵背、戴喜贵（都是共产党员）根据这个情况，决定立即进行逮捕，以免被这些坏分子逃脱。赵背等就和该村中共支部书记郝承德研究。郝承德再三嘱咐赵背等要谨慎处理，并且不能打骂人违犯政策。赵、戴便带了民兵分头捕捉董庆祥和董庆魁。董庆魁没有在家，只捉到了董庆祥，就把他绑到中队部。到队部后，赵背和公安员等便讯问董庆祥阴谋暗杀问题。董承认曾开过会，并说出有两枝枪放在张保祺家。民兵又将张保祺绑来。但张保祺坚不承认。赵背就拿枪把戳了他四下，后来张也承认了。当时，赵背等就到区委会汇报。区委说他们：“没拘捕证，随便绑人，私立公堂，这是违法的。”就把他们批评了一顿。赵背回村后将此事向郝承德说了一下，赶忙把张、董二人释放，并向他们承认不是。区里则将此情况汇报到县上。县武装部便派人到该村调查。调查后说：“这事没有什么。”因为村干部挨了批评后极力将事态缩小，未向县委说明事情的真象。区委会就决定给赵背以当众警告处分，另外几个人则给予批评。但该区对反动地主的活动问题却并未予以处理，只说由区上给予思想教育和控制。
    八月三十日，在石家庄日报副刊上又登出了一个读者呼声，批评该村干部扣人打人。并歪曲事实，说是因为董庆祥想成立巡逻小组，提到张保祺（该报写为张宝琦）家从前有枪，因而惹出事来。显然这是坏人乘我们执行政策的偏差，有意地打击积极负责的党员干部。但是正定县委没有注意这一“呼声”的可疑，反而盲目的追逼区上继续调查村干部打人绑人的事实。九月一日晚，区委又到村召开支部大会，一面说明大家工作积极是好的，但方式简单，违犯政策则是错误的。并启发大家把事情的真象坦白说出来。赵背同志遂将案件的详细经过报告了一下。区上根据这些情况，写了一个《第六区南石家庄村党员干部绑、打人事件的报告》。事情就这样不了了之。直到我十月底回京时，仍未见该县公安司法机关对这些坏分子有任何制裁。当时我也曾向区委提过意见，问他们这样处理是否犯了“宽大无边”的错误。他们认为事情既然已交给上级处理了，似乎就不应再负什么责任了。有人甚至认为“地主想反攻是很平常的事，没有什么了不起”。至于十一月以后是否处理过，我就不了解了。但我认为正定县区干部对这事件的处理是很不妥当的。他们片面地了解政策，只看到村干部随便扣人打人，却忽略了反革命分子的犯罪行为。因之，我建议正定公安司法机关，应迅速追查不法地主阴谋破坏活动的真象，而后给以应有的制裁；并应据此检查执行政务院、最高人民法院严厉惩治反革命活动的指示的情况，以免再有类似的情况发生。
