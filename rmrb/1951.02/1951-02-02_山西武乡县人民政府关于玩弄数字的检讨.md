    To the Editors of the People's Daily:

    After reading the letter from Comrade Ma Chaojun published in the reader's column of the People's Daily on December 12, 1950, entitled "Playing with Numbers, Falsely Reporting the Situation, the Wuxiang County Government's Work is Careless," we convened three meetings (attended by all section chiefs and key staff) to conduct a serious review.

    In our comprehensive report for October, we wrote: "The autumn plowing achievements are not significant. According to incomplete statistics, over 23,000 mu have been plowed." This was indeed because we did not understand the situation below and only relied on the statistics from a few villages. Without proper analysis and research, we wrote "according to incomplete statistics," which resulted in a difference of over 150,000 mu between the county government's report to the prefectural commissioner's office and the county party committee's report to the regional committee. This demonstrates our careless and unthorough bureaucratic work style. We have reviewed this practice and will definitely pay attention to overcoming it in future work.

    Regarding Comrade Ma Chaojun's letter stating: "Whether it's the ten-day report or the monthly report, they are written in advance; often the figures in this month's report are from the previous month or the first half of the month," we have some explanations to make. The reporting system stipulated by the Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office is that each county must submit its comprehensive report before the 25th of each month. Therefore, our county's monthly comprehensive report is based on the situation of the latter half of the previous month and the first half of the current month. This means the time has to be moved forward by about ten days. However, the situation of using the previous month's figures in this month's report does not exist.

                                                The People's Government of Wuxiang County

### 山西武乡县人民政府关于玩弄数字的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    山西武乡县人民政府
    关于玩弄数字的检讨编辑同志：
    看到人民日报一九五○年十二月十二日读者来信栏所登马超骏同志写的“玩弄数字、假报情况，武乡县府工作马虎”一信后，我们先后召开了三次会议（各科长及主要科员参加），认真作了检查。
    我们在十月份综合报告中写的：“秋耕成绩不大，据不完全统计，已耕二万三千余亩。”这的确是我们不了解下面情况，而只依据了几个村统计，未加正确的分析研究，就写了个“据不完全统计”，以致形成了县府向专署的报告与县委向地委的报告，相差十五万余亩。这表现了我们粗枝大叶、缺乏钻研精神的官僚主义作风。这种作法，我们已作了检讨，并且一定在今后工作中注意克服。
    马超骏同志的信上所说：“不论旬报月报，都是提前写；经常是这月的汇报数字，是上一月的，或前半月的。”这一点，我们有些说明。长治专署规定的汇报制度是：每月二十五号前，必须收到各县综合报告。因此我县的每月综合报告，就根据上月后半月与本月前半月的情况来写。这样时间就要提前十来天。但这一月汇报中用上一月数字的情况则是没有的。
                                                武乡县人民政府
