    Private Liaodong Xin Tong and Other Factories
    Violate Contracts and Oppress Workers
    Recently, incidents of capitalists mistreating workers have continuously occurred in Yingkou County, Liaodong. Wang Yupu, the manager of the private Xin Tong Grain Processing Factory, frequently violates the collective labor-capital contract and extends workers' working hours. According to statistics from the most recent month, the factory called workers to work at midnight eight times consecutively. Usually, work starts at 5:00 AM and only ends at 6:00 PM. This excessive working time was neither approved by the trade union nor compensated with overtime pay. Other factories provide three meals a day, but he only allows workers to eat two meals when there is less work. The contract stipulates that two better meals should be provided each month, but this provision has not been fulfilled in the last month. When worker Shen Baorong raised an objection, he was threatened with dismissal. Workers are forced to hold a pancake in one hand and work with the other while eating. During the New Year's Day holiday, when all factories were closed for a day, he still called workers to work without paying overtime.
    Similar phenomena exist in the private Quanshengxing Iron Factory in Dashiqiao Town. The manager of the factory, Liu Shaoquan, unreasonably dismissed worker Ye Zemin. After the trade union raised its objection, the dismissal was not carried out. Because Ye Zemin had reported Liu Shaoquan's tax evasion to the tax bureau, Liu harbored resentment and constantly found fault with Ye's work, making it impossible for Ye Zemin to continue working. The workers' dormitory in the factory is particularly dirty. On January 18th, worker Xiao Guolong was injured by smoke from a smoldering kang (heated brick bed). The trade union has suggested to the factory several times that it should invest in repairing the dormitory, but Liu Shaoquan has ignored it. In order to protect the interests of the workers, the trade union has filed a lawsuit with the county people's court against these two managers who have violated the labor-capital contract and mistreated the workers.

### 辽东私营鑫同等工厂  违反合同压迫工人

    辽东私营鑫同等工厂
    违反合同压迫工人
    辽东营口县近来连续发生资方虐待工人的事情。私营鑫同号粮谷加工工厂经理王玉璞，经常违反劳资集体合同，延长工人工作时间。据最近一个月的统计，该厂连续在午夜叫工人上班达八次。其他一般都是早晨五时开始工作，到晚六时才休息。而这种过长的工作时间，既未通过工会，也不给加班工资。其他工厂都是三顿饭，而他在活较少的时候只让工人吃两顿饭。合同上规定每月吃两顿较好些的饭，但最近一个月从未履行上述合同规定，工友沈宝荣提出意见，就威胁着要解雇他。强迫工人在吃饭时还须一手拿着饼，一手干活。元旦时各工厂都放假一日，他仍叫工友干活，又不给加工工资。
    大石桥镇私营泉盛兴铁工厂亦有类似现象。该厂经理刘绍泉曾无理解雇工人叶泽民，经工会提出意见后，解雇未成。因为叶泽民曾向税局告发刘绍泉漏税，于是刘怀恨在心，在日常工作中，经常找叶的岔子，以致叶泽民无法进行工作。该厂工人宿舍特别肮脏。一月十八日因火炕冒烟，熏伤工友萧国龙。工会为这件事曾几次建议厂方出资修理宿舍，但刘绍泉均置之不理。工会为了保护工人利益，对于这两个违反劳资合同，虐待工人的经理，现已向县人民法院提出控诉。
