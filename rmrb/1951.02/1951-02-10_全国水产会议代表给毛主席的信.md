    National Fisheries Conference Representatives
    Letter to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    The Second National Fisheries Conference has concluded victoriously. Under your wise leadership and inspiring victory, the 1950 fisheries production has reached 910,000 tons, exceeding the original target by 23.8 percent. However, we will never be satisfied with this. In order to respond to the call to resist America and aid Korea by doing a good job in production, we pledge to you with the utmost loyalty to joyfully and resolutely embrace the new task of 1.1 million tons in 1951. And we are determined to reach the highest historical record of 1.5 million tons in national fisheries production by 1952.
        
        We extend to you
    Our most sublime respect.

               All Representatives of the Second National Fisheries Conference of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
                                   January 31, 1951

    敬爱的毛主席：
    第二次全国水产会议已胜利闭幕。在你的英明领导与胜利的鼓舞之下，一九五○年的渔业生产已完成了九十一万吨，比原定任务超过了百分之二三点八。但我们绝不以此为满足，为了响应抗美援朝搞好生产，我们向你保证，誓以最高的忠诚，愉快地坚决地来迎接一九五一年一一○万吨的新任务。并决心在一九五二年内把渔业生产达到全国历史上的最高纪录一五○万吨。
        谨致
    最崇高的敬礼
               中央人民政府农业部全国第二次水产会议全体代表
                                   一九五一年一月三十一日
