　　Economic Life Trends
　Northeast China's Urban and Rural Trade Active in January
    State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in Northeast China continued to vigorously promote the sale of surplus grain from rural areas. In January, state-owned grain companies purchased 98 percent more grain than in the same period last year, and cooperatives purchased more than twice as much grain as in December of last year. After farmers found outlets for some of their surplus grain, they purchased New Year's goods and production tools one after another, which greatly increased the sales volume of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives. In January, sales of socks increased two times compared with the same period last year, towels increased one time, and ceramics even exceeded ten times. Most of these supplies were provided to farmers.
　90% of Railway Loading and Unloading Workers Nationwide Participate in Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperatives
    Ninety percent of railway loading and unloading workers nationwide have joined loading and unloading supply cooperatives, and their lives have improved significantly. According to statistics from November last year, the average actual income of more than 48,000 loading and unloading workers across the country was equivalent to 400 catties of rice per person, and reached 600 catties of rice at stations with more goods. At present, loading and unloading supply branches or loading and unloading groups have been generally established in railway stations across the country, except for a very small number of stations. The vast majority of management personnel of the loading and unloading supply cooperatives are selected from among the loading and unloading workers. Because exploitation has been eliminated, the labor enthusiasm of loading and unloading workers has been greatly improved. For example, the speed of loading and unloading coal and coke by the Tianjin Railway Bureau and the Jinan Railway Bureau has doubled compared with the past.

　　经济生活动态
　东北一月份城乡贸易活跃
    东北各地国营商业及合作社继续大力推销农村余粮，一月份国营粮食公司收购的粮食比去年同时期增加百分之九十八，合作社收购粮食超过去年十二月二倍以上。农民部分余粮找到销路后，纷纷购买年货及生产用具，因此国营贸易公司及合作社销货量大增。一月份中，袜子销量售比去年同时期增加两倍，毛巾增加一倍，而陶瓷器竟超过了十倍以上。这些物资大部是供应了农民的。
　全国铁路装卸工人十分之九参加装卸供应社
    全国铁路装卸工人已有百分之九十参加了装卸供应社，生活显著改善。据去年十一月统计：全国四万八千多个装卸工人，平均每人实得合四百斤米，在货物多的车站达六百斤米。目前全国铁路除极少数车站外，已普遍按货物多少成立了装卸供应分社或装卸小组。装卸供应社全部管理人员绝大部分是从装卸工人中选出的。由于解除了剥削，装卸工人的劳动积极性已大为提高。如天津铁路局和济南铁路局装卸煤焦类货物的速度就比过去加快了一倍。
