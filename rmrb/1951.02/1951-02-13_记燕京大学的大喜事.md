A Great Happy Event at Yenching University
Bai Sheng

　　On February 12, 1951, Yenching University was officially taken over by the Central Ministry of Education and converted into a public university.

　　On this day, the whole school was filled with joy.

　　The auditorium of Bei Gong Building was packed with thousands of people upstairs and downstairs. Although it was during the winter vacation, many teachers and students excitedly rushed back to celebrate this glorious day. After 9:30, the grand ceremony began in the solemn sound of the national anthem. Lu Zhiwei, the president of the university, walked excitedly to the microphone and spoke loudly, calling on all teachers, students, and staff of Yenching to work diligently at the people's education posts and resolutely eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in Yenching.

　　Minister Ma Xulun of the Central Ministry of Education congratulated Yenching University on behalf of the Central Ministry of Education. Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun also encouraged Yenching to move forward further.

　　All the guests who came to congratulate, representatives from Tsinghua, Peking University, Normal University, Fu Jen and other schools, congratulated the new Yenching University of the people with the most enthusiastic and cordial feelings for its boundless future. Mr. Chen Yuan, the 70-year-old former president of Fu Jen University, recalled the situation when Fu Jen University was taken over four months ago. He excitedly congratulated and cheered for the new life of Yenching University. Jiang Yinen, the representative of the Yenching University Trade Union, and Xia Ziqiang, the chairman of the Student Union, excitedly and enthusiastically assured everyone that from today onwards, they will work and study even harder, serve the people, and make Yenching University a true Yenching University of the Chinese people.

　　Yenching University has been established for thirty-two years. Most of its funding came from donations from American capitalists and was controlled by a "Yenching University Board of Trustees" (later changed to the United Board for Christian Colleges in China) composed of American capitalists and some pastors. The actual person in charge of school affairs was the cunning and sly John Leighton Stuart.

　　Today, Yenching University, which has suffered from American imperialist cultural aggression for thirty-two years, has truly returned to the embrace of the motherland and the people. This is not only a great happy event for the people of Yenching, but also a great happy event for the Chinese people.

　　记燕京大学的大喜事
　　柏生
    一九五一年二月十二日，燕京大学被中央教育部正式接收了，并改为公立大学。
    这一天，全校洋溢着一片喜气。
    贝公楼礼堂的楼上楼下挤满了上千的人。虽在寒假期中，但许多师生都兴奋地赶回来欢度这个光荣的日子。过了九点半钟，隆重的典礼，在庄严的国歌声中开始了。陆志韦校长兴奋地走到扩音器前高声地讲话，他号召燕京全体师生员工站在人民教育岗位上埋头苦干，坚决肃清美帝在燕京的文化侵略的影响。
    中央教育部马叙伦部长代表中央教育部向燕大贺喜，钱俊瑞副部长、曾昭抡副部长也都勉励燕大从此更前进一步。
    所有贺喜的宾客们，清华、北大、师大、辅仁等学校的代表们都以最热情亲切的心情祝贺人民的新燕大前途无量，七十多岁的辅仁大学老校长陈垣先生回忆了四个月前辅大被接管的情形。他分外兴奋地祝贺欢呼着燕大的新生。燕大工会代表蒋荫恩和学生会主席夏自强兴奋而热情地向大家保证，从今天起，更加紧工作、学习，为人民服务，使燕大成为真正的中国人民的燕大。
    燕京大学成立至今已有三十二年的历史，它的经费大部分是来自美国大资本家的捐款，并由美国大资本家和一些牧师共同组成了一个“燕京大学托事部”（后改为美国在华基督教大学联合托事部）来掌握，实际掌握校务的，是老奸巨滑的司徒雷登。
    今天，受了三十二年美帝文化侵略的燕京大学，真正回到祖国人民的怀抱里来了，这不仅是燕京人的一件大喜事，也是中国人民的一件大喜事。
