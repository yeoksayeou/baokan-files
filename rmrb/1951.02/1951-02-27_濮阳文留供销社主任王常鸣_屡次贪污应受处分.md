　　Puyang Wenliu Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director Wang Changming
　  Should Be Punished for Repeated Embezzlement

    To the Editor:
    Wang Changming, director of the Wenliu branch of the Puyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province, is ideologically corrupt, acts like a veteran, and is not diligent in studying his work; he shows contempt and resistance towards higher-level leaders; and acts like a bureaucrat towards his subordinates. He also colludes with other cadres in the cooperative to engage in embezzlement. According to verified investigations: when the branch purchased eggs on behalf of the county cooperative, he over-reported by 960,000 yuan; during the inventory of the branch's materials, an excess of 770,000 yuan in payments was discovered, but Wang Changming only reported 120,000 yuan; Wang Changming personally used and privately lent public funds totaling 2,460,000 yuan; when issuing production loans, he himself took a loan of 800 jin of grain first, and gave preferential treatment by lending a total of more than 1,700 jin to his friends; last spring, he made a profit of more than 1,300 jin of grain from purchasing homespun cloth, but he concealed it.
    When the county cooperative arranged for the consolidation of the work of each cooperative, Wang Changming, in order to cover up his embezzlement, used despicable means such as bribing cadres and treating guests to buy off cadres within the cooperative, and openly said: "Whoever reports to the county cooperative is not being a friend." The cooperative's accountant firmly rejected his bribe and reported his misdeeds to the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative. After investigation by the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Wang Changming has now been ordered to conduct self-reflection. Wang Changming's embezzlement violates the country's financial regulations, and the government should give him the punishment he deserves and recover the embezzled funds and goods.

　　濮阳文留供销社主任王常鸣
　  屡次贪污应受处分
    编辑同志：
    平原省濮阳县供销社文留分社主任王常鸣思想腐化，摆老资格，不虚心钻研业务；对上级领导表现轻视、抵抗；对下级则摆官僚架子。他并拉拢该社干部共同进行贪污。据检查有据者：该分社代县社收购鸡蛋时，他多报了九十六万元；在清理分社物资时，发现多出货款七十七万元，但王常鸣却仅上报十二万元；王常鸣个人动用及私自出借公款计二百四十六万元；在发放生产贷款时，他自己首先贷粮八百斤，并徇私情贷给自己的朋友共一千七百多斤；去年春天收购土布，赚粮一千三百多斤，但他却隐瞒不报。
    当县社布置整理各社工作时，王常鸣为了掩饰自己的贪污事实，用贿赂干部、请客等卑鄙手段，收买社内干部，并公开说：“谁要报告县社，谁就不够朋友。”该社会计坚决拒绝他的贿赂，并将其恶迹报告了专区供销社。专区供销社调查后，现正令王常鸣进行反省。王常鸣这种贪污行为是违犯了国家的财政纪律的，政府应该给以应得的处分，并追回其贪污的款物。
