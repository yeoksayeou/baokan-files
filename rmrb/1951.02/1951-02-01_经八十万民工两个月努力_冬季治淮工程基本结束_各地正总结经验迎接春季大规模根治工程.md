　　After Two Months of Effort by 800,000 Workers
    Winter Huai River Harnessing Project Basically Completed
    Various Localities are Summarizing Experiences to Welcome Large-Scale Fundamental Harnessing Project in Spring
    [Our Newspaper] Since the first winter project of harnessing the Huai River by 800,000 workers in Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu began successively in November 1950, it has basically ended by now. This winter project of the Huai River is the prelude to the fundamental harnessing of the Huai River. Various localities are now summarizing experiences to prepare for the large-scale Huai River harnessing project this spring.
    The key points of the winter construction in the upper reaches of the Huai River are the water storage projects in four depressions: Laowangpo, Wu Song Lake, Jiao Ting Lake, and Tong Lake, as well as the partial dredging and damming and embankment restoration projects of the Ying River, Ru River, Bailu River, Zhu River, Guan River, and Du River. More than 90,000 workers were mobilized, completing 1.6 million cubic meters of earthwork. The earthwork projects at Laowangpo and Wu Song Lake have been fully completed. Key construction has been carried out at Tong Lake and Jiao Ting Lake. The dredging and embankment restoration projects of various rivers have also been completed according to plan. It is estimated that the above four lakes can store 680 million cubic meters of floodwater. Before the completion of the water storage reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huai River and the sea outlet waterway in the lower reaches, the depression water storage project is an important key to reducing the disaster-stricken area of the Huai River Basin. This winter construction is only a part of the entire depression water storage project in the upper reaches.
    The winter Huai River harnessing project in northern Anhui in the middle reaches started successively in November last year. By January this year, the number of workers on the embankment had reached more than 600,000. During the project, thanks to the efforts of cadres at all levels and the vast number of workers, the project progressed faster than expected. Some sections of the project have completed their tasks ahead of the original plan. The 140,000 cubic meters of earthwork in Huainan City and the 600,000 cubic meters of embankment restoration project in Fuyang County have been fully completed. Bengbu City has completed 430,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The dredging and embankment restoration in the Fuyang and Su County areas and the two cities of Bengbu and Huainan have completed a total of 7.97 million cubic meters. By early January, due to continuous rain and snow and the cold weather, in order to maintain the consolidation of the project, the embankment restoration projects in various places have temporarily come to an end. However, some dredging projects are still persisting in their work, such as the Sui River dredging project across northeastern Anhui, the mechanical ship dredging project in the shallow section of the main stream of the Huai River at Zhengyangguan, and the Dongfei River dredging project in Shouxian County, which only started on January 16. More than 130,000 workers are still digging soil and dredging rivers in the freezing cold.
    The policy of the Huai River harnessing project in northern Anhui is to emphasize both storage and drainage. The winter construction is the embankment restoration and dredging work of the important tributaries along the Huai River and the embankment restoration project of some sections of the main stream. However, the northern Anhui region needs to store 5 billion cubic meters of floodwater. The task of the water storage project is very heavy. Various preparations are currently being actively carried out in order to launch large-scale projects in the spring.
    The winter repair project of the canal dike in northern Jiangsu in the lower reaches of the Huai River focuses on strengthening and reinforcing the dike. 68,800 workers have been put on the dike and have completed 1.27 million cubic meters of earthwork. Before the completion of the Huai River's sea outlet waterway, the canal in northern Jiangsu is still the tail end of the Huai River's drainage, so it is necessary to pay attention to consolidating the canal dike, especially strengthening the safety of the left dike of the canal.
    In order to welcome the large-scale fundamental Huai River harnessing project in the spring of 1951, the Huai River Harnessing Committee has notified the command headquarters of various provinces and regions to conduct a summary of the winter repair project. The Henan Provincial Huai River Harnessing Command Headquarters held a political work meeting on January 22. Northern Anhui also held a meeting immediately after the end of the embankment restoration project to summarize the winter repair project and arrange the preparatory work before the spring project.

　　经八十万民工两个月努力
    冬季治淮工程基本结束            
    各地正总结经验迎接春季大规模根治工程
    【本报讯】河南、皖北、苏北八十万民工根治淮河的第一个冬季工程，自一九五○年十一月间先后开始动工以后，至目前止，已基本结束。这次淮河冬季工程是根治淮河的序幕，现各地正进行总结经验，准备迎接今年春季大规模的治淮工程。
    淮河上游冬季施工重点是老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、童湖等四处洼地蓄洪工程，以及颍河、汝河、白露河、竹河、灌河、杜河等河道的部分疏浚和堵口复堤工程，共动员民工九万余人，完成土工一百六十万公方。老王坡及吴宋湖两处土方工程已全部完成，童湖、蛟停湖两处进行了重点施工，各河疏浚复堤等工程，亦已按计划完成，估计以上四湖可蓄洪六亿八千万立方公尺。在淮河上游蓄水库和下游入海水道未修建完成以前，洼地蓄洪工程是目前缩小淮河流域受灾面积的重要关键，这次冬季施工的仅是上游全部洼地蓄洪工程的一部分。
    中游皖北冬季治淮工程，于去年十一月先后开工，至今年一月份上堤民工已达六十余万人。在工程进行中，由于各级干部和广大民工的努力，工程进行较预料为快，部分地区工段已按原计划提前完成任务，淮南市十四万土方与阜阳县六十万土方复堤工程已全部竣工，蚌埠市完成四十三万土方，阜阳、宿县两专区的疏浚复堤及蚌埠、淮南两市共完成七百九十七万公方。至一月上旬，因雨雪连绵，气候转寒，为保持工程的巩固，各地复堤工程已暂告结束。但仍有部分疏浚工程尚在坚持工作，如横贯皖东北的濉河疏浚工程、正阳关淮河干流浅段机船挖泥疏浚工程，以及在一月十六日才开工的寿县东肥河疏浚工程，共有十三万余民工，仍在冰天雪地里，坚持挖土浚河。
    皖北治淮工程方针是蓄泄并重，冬季施工的是沿淮各重要支流的复堤疏浚工作，和部分干流堤段的复堤工程；但皖北地区须承蓄洪水五十亿公方，蓄洪工程任务甚大，目前正积极进行各项准备工作，以备春工时大规模开展。
    淮河下游苏北运河堤的冬修工程，为重点培修与加戗，上堤民工六万八千八百余人，已完成土工一百二十七万公方。在淮河入海水道未完成放水前，苏北运河仍为淮河的泄水尾闾，因此巩固运河堤，特别是加强运河左堤的安全，必须注意。
    为迎接一九五一年春季大规模的根治淮河工程，治淮委员会已通知各省、区指挥部进行冬修工程的总结工作。河南省治淮指挥部已于一月二十二日召开政工会议，皖北亦于复堤工程结束后，随即召开会议，总结冬修工程，布置春工前的准备工作。
