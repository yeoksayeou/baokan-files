	Public Economic Organizations Should Actively Participate in the Patriotic Parade of the Business Community

　　When the Chengde Municipal business community held a patriotic parade some time ago, the employees of the municipal state-owned department store did not participate, which was wrong. The staff of public industrial and commercial enterprises and institutions should not only participate in the patriotic movement of the business community, but also play an active role in the movement, in order to unite all patriotic industrial and commercial circles in China and the masses of the people, form a solid united front against imperialist aggression, and strive for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. Regarding this matter, the Chengde Municipal State-owned Department Store has already made a written self-criticism, and correctly pointed out in the self-criticism that this was due to their failure to recognize that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the most important political task of the people of the whole country, and their failure to recognize the leading position of the state-owned economy in the five economic components of the new democratic society. This lesson deserves the attention of all regions.
　　At present, more than 1,030,000 industrialists and businessmen in 80 large, medium, and small cities and towns across the country have held rallies and demonstrations to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and have widely signed patriotic pacts. However, in most cities and market towns, the patriotic movement of the business community has not yet developed well, and some places where it has been launched are not in-depth enough, and efforts should continue to be made to promote the widespread and in-depth development of the movement. Staff of public economic organizations must closely unite with private industrialists and businessmen to jointly promote the patriotic movement forward.

　　公营经济机关应当积极参加工商界爱国游行
    承德市工商界在前些时候举行爱国游行时，该市国营百货公司的从业人员没有参加，这是不对的。公营工商企业机关的工作人员不仅应当参加工商界的爱国运动，而且应当在运动中起积极的作用，以便团结全中国一切爱国的工商业界，和人民大众在一起，结成巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，为抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。对于这件事，承德市国营百货公司方面已经作了书面检讨，并在检讨中正确地指出：这是由于他们不认识抗美援朝是全国人民最重要的政治任务，不认识国营经济在新民主主义社会五种经济成份中的领导地位所致。这个教训，值得引起各地注意。
    目前全国已有八十个大、中、小城镇的一百零三万人以上的工商业者，举行了抗美援朝集会和示威游行，并且广泛地签订了爱国公约。但是在多数城市和集镇，工商界的爱国运动还没有很好发展，已经发动的有些地方还不够深入，还应继续努力使运动普遍和深入地发展起来。公营经济机关工作人员必须与私营工商业者紧密团结一致，共同把爱国运动推向前进。
