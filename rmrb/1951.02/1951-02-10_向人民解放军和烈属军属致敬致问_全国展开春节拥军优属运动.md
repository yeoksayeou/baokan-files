    Youth from all walks of life in Beijing enthusiastically responded to the call of the People's Government and actively participated in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel during the Spring Festival. They assisted the People's Government in delivering gifts worth 300,000 jin of millet to more than 19,000 families of martyrs and military personnel in the city within a day or two, and extended New Year greetings to them. Young workers from the 70th Ordnance Factory and the Beijing Machine Factory, together with other workers, sent portraits of Chairman Mao, Spring Festival couplets, and other gifts to the families of comrades participating in military cadre schools.
