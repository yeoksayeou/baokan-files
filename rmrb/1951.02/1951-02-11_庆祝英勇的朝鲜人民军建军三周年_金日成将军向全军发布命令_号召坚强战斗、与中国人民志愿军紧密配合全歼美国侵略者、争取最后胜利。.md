　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on February 8th, the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, stating:
　　Brave soldiers of our army, navy, and air force! Commanders and political workers! Honorable male and female guerrillas!
　　Today, the liberation war to strive for the unification, independence, and freedom of the fatherland has reached a decisive stage. In this solemn environment, we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army.
　　The heroic People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, in close cooperation, have completely liberated the ancient capital of our fatherland, the democratic capital of the republic, Pyongyang, and all areas of the northern half of the republic that were temporarily occupied by the enemy, driving the enemy completely south of the 38th parallel. The People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are pursuing and encircling the fleeing enemy, liberating the capital of the republic, Seoul, and many cities and villages in the southern half of the republic, and are continuing to expand their victories, launching fierce battles. Our respectable and brave guerrilla joint forces have penetrated deep behind enemy lines, igniting the flames of guerrilla warfare, launching surprise attacks on enemy headquarters, destroying enemy transportation lines and communication organs, and attacking enemy supply depots, causing even greater confusion among the defeated enemy.
　　For several months, we have achieved significant victories in the fierce battles of the patriotic liberation war. This victory has laid the foundation for the liberation of Korea, exposed the weakness of American imperialism, and inflicted a major blow on America's aggressive plans in the Far East. It has made the chaos and conflicts within the aggressive imperialist camp and within American imperialism even more acute; it is inspiring the oppressed people of Asia to carry out liberation struggles against imperialism.
　　Our young Korean People's Army, in the sacred Fatherland Liberation War to liberate the fatherland and people from the aggression of American imperialism, has fully demonstrated its bravery, audacity, and patriotic dedication, showing its power to the whole world. Inspired by a noble mission, our commanders and fighters have demonstrated their combat efficiency and military skills in fierce battles, as well as a high degree of discipline and organizational ability. Our commanders have inspired the fighters under their command with their own example. In the just and fierce battle to annihilate and drive out the American invaders, many commanders and fighters of our People's Army have become heroes and model soldiers. A large number of commanders and fighters of the People's Army have been awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for their special meritorious services, and many have received medals and awards. The People's Army, which has gone through a difficult period of retreat, has grown and become stronger, becoming a powerful armed force.
　　The participation of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers in our combat has made the situation on the front favorable to us. Our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have conducted three coordinated operations, eliminating 60,000 enemy troops and destroying a large amount of enemy combat equipment. The American invaders who are unwilling to leave Korea will be surrounded and completely annihilated. In the areas temporarily occupied by the American executioners, our beloved parents, brothers, sisters, wives, and children are suffering from inhuman violence and destruction. The hands of the American bandits are stained with the blood of the Korean people. We will never forget the atrocities of the American bandits, and we must take revenge on the invaders who have caused suffering to our people.
　　We have all the necessary conditions to achieve victory. The People's Army is loved and supported by the people throughout the country and has blood ties with the people. Our just struggle is not isolated! The great Soviet Union and the Chinese people are giving us tremendous assistance in our just war. The people of the various people's democratic countries are supporting us. Honest people all over the world sympathize with our struggle. The morale of the People's Army is incomparably higher than that of the enemy. Our commanders and fighters know what they are fighting for, and they believe that their cause is just. Conversely, the morale of the officers and soldiers of the American invading army, which is waging an unjust war of aggression against our people, is extremely low and is deteriorating day by day. The American invading army has suffered not only political but also military defeats in Korea.
　　Fighters, commanders, and political workers! Male and female guerrillas! The day of the final victory in our great patriotic liberation war and the complete annihilation and expulsion of the enemy is approaching. Our victory will not come by itself; victory cannot be won without a tenacious and arduous struggle. The defeated enemy is putting up fierce resistance, using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the victories we have already won; we must further increase our revolutionary vigilance and more ruthlessly and resolutely eliminate the enemy. On this glorious third anniversary of the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army, I salute and congratulate you. In order to strive for the final victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War, I order:
　　First, all fighters of the People's Army must master their weapons, constantly improve their military skills, act correctly in accordance with the requirements of military regulations and codes, execute orders from superiors promptly and correctly, strictly observe military discipline and order, further strengthen organization, and give full play to a lofty fighting spirit.
　　Second, commanders and political workers at all levels must strengthen the study of leadership techniques, organize the coordinated operations between various units well, improve and develop the eyes and ears of the army – reconnaissance work – in all aspects, raise the work of the headquarters to a higher level, boldly and widely absorb the experience of advanced guard units, and further enhance the revolutionary spirit of the troops.
　　Third, all officers and soldiers of the People's Army must more closely organize and develop coordinated actions with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers and exchange information with each other. In battle, be even braver and more tenacious.
　　Fourth, the staff in the rear must guarantee the timely supply of various weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to the front lines, provide good cover for transportation equipment under enemy air raids, carefully sort out and utilize captured spoils, and quickly repair damaged military equipment to supply the front lines.
　　Fifth, male and female guerrillas must effectively coordinate with the offensive of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, attack enemy headquarters, destroy enemy transportation lines and communications, and strengthen the disruption behind enemy lines.
　　Sixth, to celebrate the great victory won by our heroic People's Army, I order that on the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army – at eight o'clock in the evening of February 8th – 120 artillery pieces will fire twenty salvos in our fatherland's capital, Seoul, and in Pyongyang.

　　庆祝英勇的朝鲜人民军建军三周年
　  金日成将军向全军发布命令        
    号召坚强战斗、与中国人民志愿军紧密配合全歼美国侵略者、争取最后胜利。
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军于二月八日朝鲜人民军建军三周年纪念日发布命令称：
    我们勇敢的陆海空军战士们！指挥官和政治工作者们！可敬的男女游击队员们！
    今天，为争取祖国统一、独立和人民自由的解放战争已到了决定性阶段，在这一庄严环境中，我们庆祝英勇的朝鲜人民军建军三周年。
    英勇的人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军，以紧密的配合作战，完全解放了曾被敌人暂时侵占的我祖国的古都、共和国的民主首都平壤及共和国北半部全部地区，把敌人完全驱逐到三八线以南。人民军和中国人民志愿军追击和围歼着逃敌，解放了共和国的首都汉城及共和国南半部的许多城市和乡村，并正继续扩大战果，展开着猛烈的战斗。我们可敬的勇敢的游击队联合部队，深入敌后，燃烧起游击战争的烽火，奇袭敌人的司令部，并破坏敌人的运输线和通讯联络机关，袭击敌人的军需品仓库，使败敌愈加混乱。
    若干月来，我们已在爱国的解放战争的猛烈战斗中取得了意义重大的胜利。这个胜利给朝鲜的解放奠定了基础，揭露了美帝国主义的软弱无力，并使美国在远东的侵略计划遭受重大的打击。它使侵略性的帝国主义阵营内部和美帝国主义内部的混乱与冲突，变得更加尖锐；它鼓舞着亚洲的被压迫的人民进行反对帝国主义的解放斗争。
    我们年轻的朝鲜人民军，在从美帝国主义的侵略中解放祖国与人民的神圣的祖国解放战争中，充分发挥了勇敢、大胆和爱国主义的献身精神，向全世界显示了自己的威力。我们的指战员们在崇高使命的鼓舞下，在猛烈的战斗中表现了他们的战斗效率和军事技术，表现了高度的纪律性和组织能力。我们的指挥员用自己的表率，鼓舞了在他们指挥下的战斗员。在歼灭和驱逐美国侵略者的正义的猛烈战斗中，我们人民军的许多指挥官和战斗员已经成为英雄和模范战士。人民军大批的指挥员和战斗员由于特殊的功勋，已经得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的称号，许多人得到勋章和奖章。经历过艰苦的撤退时期的人民军已经成长、壮大，变成强有力的武装部队了。
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军参加我们的战斗，使得前线的形势变得对我们有利了。我们人民军和中国人民志愿军进行了三次配合作战，消灭了敌人的有生力量六万名，摧毁了敌军大量战斗装备。不愿意离开朝鲜的美国侵略者将被包围和全部歼灭。在暂时被美国刽子手们占领的地区，我们挚爱的父母、兄弟、姐妹、妻子和儿女，正遭受残无人性的暴力的摧残和毁灭。美国匪徒们的手上染满了朝鲜人民的鲜血。我们决不会忘记美国匪徒们的暴行，我们一定要向造成我国人民的苦难的侵略者复仇。
    我们有获得胜利的一切必要条件。人民军得到全国人民的爱戴和支持，与人民有着血缘的关系。我们的正义斗争不是孤立的！伟大的苏联和中国人民给予正在进行着正义战争的我们以莫大的援助。各人民民主国家的人民在声援我们。全世界正直的人们都同情着我们的斗争。人民军的士气比敌军的士气高得无法比拟。我们的指挥员和战斗员知道他们正在为之作战的是什么，他们相信他们的事业是正义的。相反地，正在对我国人民进行非正义的侵略战争的美国侵略军的官兵的士气则极其低落，而且正在日益衰败。美国侵略军在朝鲜不但遭受了政治的失败，而且也遭受了军事的失败。
    战斗员，指挥员和政治工作人员们！男女游击队员们！我们伟大的爱国解放战争中的最后胜利以及完全歼灭和赶走敌人的日子快要到了。我们的胜利是不会自己来的，不经过顽强艰苦的斗争是不能赢得胜利的。遭受失败的敌军正在进行猛烈的抵抗，他们使用各种各样的阴谋诡计。因此，我们不应当满足于我们已得的胜利，我们必须更提高革命警觉，更无情地坚决地消灭敌军。当此英勇的朝鲜人民军建军三周年纪念日，我向你们致敬和祝贺。为了争取伟大的祖国解放战争的最后胜利，我命令：
    第一、人民军的全体战斗员要精通自己的武器，不断地提高自己的军事技术，要正确按照军事规程和典范的要求来行动，要及时、正确地执行上级命令，严守军纪和秩序，进一步加强组织性，发挥崇高的战斗精神。
    第二、各级指挥官和政治工作人员要加强学习领导技术，很好地组织各部队间的配合作战，从各方面来改进和发展军队的耳目——侦察工作，使司令部的工作提到更高的水平，要果敢地广泛地吸收先进近卫部队的经验，进一步提高部队的革命精神。
    第三、人民军的全体官兵要更紧密地组织并发展和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军的协同动作，互相交换情报。在战斗中，更要勇敢和顽强。
    第四、后方的工作人员要保证及时向前线供应各种武器、弹药和军需器材，在敌机空袭下要很好地掩护运输器材，缴获的战利品要细致地加以整理和利用，要迅速修复被破坏的军需器材，供应前线。
    第五、男女游击队员要有效地配合人民军和中国人民志愿军的进攻，袭击敌人的司令部，破坏敌人的交通线和通讯联络，加强对敌后的扰乱。
    第六、为庆祝我们英勇的人民军所获得的伟大胜利，我命令在朝鲜人民军建军三周年的今天——二月八日晚八时，在我祖国的首都汉城和平壤，以一百二十门大炮鸣炮二十响。
