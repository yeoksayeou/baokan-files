　　Nationalities Affairs Commission Vice Chairman Ulanhu's Spring Festival Broadcast to All Brotherly Nationalities

　　Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission Vice Chairman Ulanhu broadcast a speech to all minority nationalities across the country on the Spring Festival of 1951. The speech is as follows:

　　Dear compatriots of all brotherly nationalities across the country!

　　The Spring Festival is here, and I would like to extend my sincere greetings and congratulations to everyone.

　　We Chinese have always considered the Spring Festival as a time of rejuvenation of the earth, but in old China, this day never brought a good life to our people, especially our minority nationalities. We always lived in pain and disaster. Only the new China has truly brought happiness to our minority nationalities. In the past year, we have achieved unprecedented unity among all nationalities in the People's Republic of China, and the lives of our people of all nationalities have greatly improved. Taking the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as an example, under the leadership of their own government, the agriculture and animal husbandry of the Mongolian people are prospering day by day, and culture and education are also developing.

　　This happiness is entirely given to us by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and we should thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Dear compatriots, we all know that just as we were carrying out peaceful construction, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and openly armed and invaded our country's Taiwan. Its purpose is to destroy our happy life and undermine the friendly and cooperative family of our people of all nationalities. After suffering a painful defeat in the Korean War due to the severe blows of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, American imperialism is now conspiring to arm Japan to continue expanding the war of aggression. We must be highly vigilant, pay close attention to, and resolutely oppose this evil conspiracy of American imperialism.

　　We firmly believe that the Chinese people of all nationalities once defeated the heinous Japanese fascists; once overthrew the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, which was strongly supported by American imperialism; and have already exposed American imperialism as a paper tiger on the Korean battlefield. If American imperialism insists on being an enemy of the Chinese people to the end, the Chinese people of all nationalities have ample strength to ensure that it suffers even more severe blows and is completely defeated.

　　Dear compatriots, in order to defend our happy motherland family, we must continue to launch the movement to resist America and aid Korea, so that every one of our minority nationalities knows that although American imperialism is vicious, it is just a paper tiger. We should recognize the strength of our motherland, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party, we should further unite and strive for the greater strength of our motherland and the increasing development of the lives of our people of all nationalities.

　　Finally, I wish you all a happy Spring Festival.

### 民族事务委员会乌兰夫副主任委员  春节向全国各兄弟民族广播

　　民族事务委员会乌兰夫副主任委员       
    春节向全国各兄弟民族广播
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府民族事务委员会乌兰夫副主任委员于一九五一年春节，向全国各少数民族同胞广播讲话。讲词如下：亲爱的全国各兄弟民族的同胞们！
    春节到了，我现在向大家表示深切的慰问和祝贺。
    我们中国人一向认为春节是大地回春的日子，可是在旧中国，这个日子从来也没有给我们人民，特别是我们少数民族人民，带来好的生活，我们始终在痛苦和灾难里面过活。只有新的中国，才真的给我们少数民族带来了幸福。一年来，我们在中华人民共和国里实现了各民族的空前大团结，我们各族人民的生活有了很大的改进。以内蒙自治区来说，蒙古人民在自己政权的领导下，农业和牧业都一天一天兴旺了，文化教育也发展起来了。
    这些幸福完全是毛主席和中国共产党给我们的，我们应该感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。
    亲爱的同胞们，我们都已经知道，正当我们进行和平建设的时候，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时公开武装侵略我国的台湾。它的目的，就是要来摧毁我们幸福的生活，破坏我们各民族人民友爱合作的大家庭。美帝国主义这种狂妄的企图，在朝鲜战争当中，经我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军严重打击而遭受惨痛的失败之后，现在它又阴谋武装日本来继续扩大侵略战争。对美帝国主义这个罪恶阴谋，我们必须提高警惕，严密注意，并坚决反对。
    我们深信：我们中国各民族人民曾经打垮了万恶的日本法西斯；曾经推翻了美帝国主义所极力支持的蒋介石的反动政府，也已经在朝鲜战场上戳穿了美帝国主义这个纸老虎，如果美帝国主义，一定要和中国人民为敌到底，我们中国各民族人民有着充分的力量，一定使它遭受更其惨重的打击而彻底失败。
    亲爱的同胞们，为了保卫我们幸福的祖国大家庭，我们必须继续展开抗美援朝运动，使我们少数民族每一个人都知道美帝国主义虽然狠毒，却不过是一个纸老虎。我们应该认识我们祖国的强大，我们要在毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导之下，更进一步地团结起来，为争取我们祖国的更加强大，和我们各民族人民生活的日益发展而奋斗。
    最后，祝大家春节愉快。
