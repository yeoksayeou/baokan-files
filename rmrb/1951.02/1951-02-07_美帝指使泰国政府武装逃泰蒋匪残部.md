　　US Imperialism Directs Thai Government
　　To Arm Remnants of Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Troops Fleeing to Thailand

　　(Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 31st) According to Thailand's *Dazhong* newspaper, under the direction of the United States, the Thai government has reached an agreement with representatives of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to form an army using the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's defeated troops who have fled to Thailand. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have now established a headquarters in Ye Shi, maintaining direct communication with Taiwan via radio. The *Commercial News* newspaper stated that Thai Police Chief Kosol officially admitted that the Thai government, headed by Luang Phibunsongkhram, has permitted Chiang Kai-shek's troops to remain in Thailand "to perform the same work as American troops." Progressive newspapers point out that the United States intends to use Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to strike at the national liberation movement in Vietnam and to attack China. According to Thai newspapers, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Stanton said that the United States has intensified its military "aid" to Thailand. In the past three months alone, the United States has supplied Thailand with a large number of rifles, machine guns, pistols, mortars, rocket equipment, naval guns, and other types of weapons.
