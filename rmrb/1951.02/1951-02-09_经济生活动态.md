　　Hebei Adopts New Methods to Prevent Chicken Plague
　　In view of the annual chicken plague epidemic that affects the development of chicken farming as a sideline occupation, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to adopt a simple chicken plague prevention medicine invented by the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute in ten key counties this year on a trial basis, striving to immunize one million chickens. The veterinary epidemic stations in each region are currently sending people to rural areas to guide the use of the medicine. In Dawen Village, Anguo, 373 chickens in 308 households have been vaccinated.

　　Wanbei Distributes More Than 20 Million Jin of Disaster Relief Grain
　　The Wanbei Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters, in order to help disaster victims celebrate the Spring Festival and prepare for spring plowing and large-scale production, has distributed 22.6 million jin of rice as disaster relief grain. The distribution of this relief grain began on January 17, focusing on key areas, and it is estimated that all of it can be distributed before the Spring Festival. As for the food needed by the disaster victims during the spring plowing season, the Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters is also preparing for it. In order to prevent disaster victims from relying solely on relief, special emphasis is placed on publicity and education when distributing this relief grain, explaining that material rewards will be given to those who are active in production.

　　Tianjin Private Banks Complete Financial Plans
　　Most private banks in Tianjin exceeded their financial plans for December last year, averaging an excess of 10.72 percent. The implementation of financial plans by each bank has only been going on for two months, but the facts prove that the business of banks and firms that seriously implement the plans is thriving. Some individual banks neglect the financial plan as a way to overcome blind operation, develop business towards planned operation and economic accounting, and therefore do not pay enough attention to the implementation of the plan.

　　Eighty-Five Silk Factories in East China Receive Assistance
　　The China Silk Company will continue to adopt processing methods to provide key assistance to private silk weaving factories in East China this year. Based on the winter weaving performance in 1950, the targets for assistance have been determined to be 38 factories in Hangzhou and Wuxing, 9 in Suzhou, and 38 in Shanghai, for a total of 17,450 bolts of silk to be woven, mainly crepe de chine and georgette.

　　Northern Jiangsu Yi River Diversion Auxiliary Project Completed
　　The auxiliary project for the Yi River Diversion in northern Jiangsu this winter involved a total of 10.3 million cubic meters of earthwork. Mobilizing 308,000 laborers from nine counties across the region, construction began successively in mid-November of last year. Overcoming difficulties such as deep rivers, muddy soil, and cold water, a comprehensive and intensive rush was carried out, and it was successfully completed on the 5th of last month. The above-mentioned project will benefit 3 million mu of farmland and is estimated to increase grain production by 200 million jin.
