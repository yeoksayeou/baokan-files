Xinhua News Agency, 15th: A United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 14th revealed that Audet, the commander of the Dutch troops acting as accomplices to the American army in its aggression against Korea, was killed in action by the Chinese and Korean People's forces in Hoengseong on the 12th. Audet, under orders from the American military authorities in Korea, led the Dutch accomplice troops in a "rear guard battle" to cover the American troops "breaking out of the Communist army's encirclement," serving as a scapegoat for the American army.
