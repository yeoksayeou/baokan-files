Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th. The Standing National Committee of the French Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace has filed a complaint with the High Court on the 15th, accusing French Prime Minister Pleven and Defense Minister Moch of treason for the French government's policy of arming West Germany. The complaint emphasizes that since the Franco-German peace treaty has not yet been concluded, France is still legally at war with Germany. However, the government of Pleven and Moch, "disregarding its most solemn guarantees and the repeated resolutions passed by parliament, has consistently agreed to and assisted in the rearmament of Germany," thereby committing the "crime of undermining the external security of the state." The complaint details Pleven and Moch's various traitorous acts at the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's Brussels meeting in December last year and at the recent Truman-Pleven Washington meeting. It also accuses the so-called "European Army Conference," convened by the French government and held in Paris from the 15th, with German Nazi officers in attendance, of undoubtedly formulating plans harmful to French security and "leaking deployment and intelligence related to national defense." The complaint cites articles of the French Constitution and laws punishing activities that undermine national defense, requesting the prosecutor to ask the National Assembly to impeach the government of Pleven and Moch in accordance with the law.

The complaint was signed by Fachon, Chairman of the Standing National Committee of the Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace and former Minister of Food, and members of the Standing National Committee, including Dastier, former Minister of the Interior in the wartime government-in-exile in London, Dillon, former Deputy Minister of the Air Force, Abbot Blier, and Independent Republican Member of Parliament Delavallée, among others.

　　法全国和平委员会
    控告普利文莫克叛国
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：法国争和平自由战士协会常设全国委员会已就法国政府奉行武装西德政策一事，于十五日向高等法院递状控诉法国总理普利文和国防部长莫克犯叛国罪。控诉状着重指出：法德和约尚未缔订，法国在法律上仍与德国处于战争状态，但普利文与莫克的政府竟“不顾它曾作过的最郑重的保证，不顾议会一再通过的决议，以其一贯的政策同意并协助重新武装德国”，从而犯了“破坏国家外部安全的罪行”。控诉状详细列举普利文与莫克在去年十二月北大西洋侵略集团布鲁塞尔会议上和最近杜鲁门、普利文华盛顿会议上所作的种种卖国行为，并指控目前由法国政府召集而于十五日起在巴黎举行的，有德国纳粹军官们出席的所谓“欧洲军会议”，无疑将制订出有害于法国安全的计划，“泄露有关国防的部署和情报”。控诉状逐条援引法国宪法与惩处破坏国防之活动的法律，要求检察官请国民议会对普利文与莫克的政府依法提出弹劾。
    在控诉状上签字的，有争和平自由战士协会常设全国委员会主席、前粮食部长法奇，与常设全国委员会各委员，其中包括：战时在伦敦的流亡政府内政部长达斯蒂尔、前空军部副部长狄隆、修道院院长布利埃、独立共和党议员戴拉维齐列等。
