　　Tax Collection Work in Beijing in the Second Year After Liberation
　　By Ma Yingzhong, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau

    Beijing's tax collection work in 1950, under the correct implementation of tax policies, exceeded the original plan by 35%, ensuring financial expenditure and cooperating with the work of stabilizing finance and prices. The achievement of this success was mainly due to the improvement of the business conditions of industry and commerce. At the same time, it was also due to the correct leadership of the higher authorities and the support of the majority of citizens, especially industrialists and merchants, for the government in terms of tax payment, as well as the hard work of tax cadres and the continuous improvement of tax work.

    When collecting the industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949 in April 1950, it was a time when national industry and commerce were suffering temporary difficulties. To this end, the government had implemented reductions, exemptions, and deferrals for taxpayers in difficulty. Since May, the government has taken a series of measures to adjust industry and commerce and adjust taxation, and the situation of industry and commerce has gradually improved, and the business volume of various industries has increased month by month. According to the survey materials of the Municipal Tax Bureau: the autumn business volume of general industries increased by 45% compared with the spring, and the winter business volume increased by more than double compared with the spring. Therefore, our tax revenue can be increased, exceeding the original plan. The proportion of various taxes in the total tax revenue is as follows: private industrial and commercial tax 23.43%, public enterprise industrial and commercial tax 15.91%, temporary commercial tax 8.13%, commodity tax 21.39%, stamp tax 10.45%, real estate tax 6.82%, and other taxes 13.87%.

    Secondly, in terms of tax cadres, the vast majority of tax cadres in Beijing joined the People's Government after liberation. After studying, their thinking and work style have greatly improved. The work enthusiasm has been consistently high. The tax collection work is very heavy, but the number of cadres is insufficient. They work tirelessly, often working overtime at night, and even not being able to rest on Sundays. In the year-end performance appraisal movement in 1950, 119 model workers emerged from the 1,400-odd cadres of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau. The achievement of Beijing's tax collection work is inseparable from the efforts of all cadres.

    In terms of improving working methods, our work goals set in 1950 were to overcome the overdue collection of seasonal taxes, the difficulty of centralized payment of funds, correct the phenomenon of unbalanced tax burden, and simplify procedures as much as possible to benefit merchants and the people. The following measures were taken:

    (1) Improvement of Industrial and Commercial Tax Collection Methods

    The "democratic appraisal" method was adopted for the industrial and commercial tax in 1949. That is, the overall tax task is distributed from top to bottom, and the tax amount of each household is democratically appraised from bottom to top. This method does not calculate and levy taxes according to the actual business volume and tax rate, and has great estimation, thus resulting in the phenomenon of excessively light and heavy tax burdens. At the same time, business tax and income tax are combined and collected once every six months, and centralized payment makes it difficult for industrialists and merchants to raise funds.

    In order to overcome the imbalance of the tax burden, stabilize the operating sentiment of industrialists and merchants, and ensure tax revenue, the methods of "self-declaration and public discussion" and "fixed amount at regular intervals" based on self-declaration and public discussion were adopted when collecting the spring and summer business tax in 1950. "Self-declaration and public discussion" is to declare the business volume and then levy tax according to the tax rate after evaluation. As a result, the burden on each household has been appropriately adjusted. Tax revenue has also increased. Since the second half of 1950, the three methods stipulated by the central government have been fully implemented, and the "self-declaration and public discussion" households in the first half of the year have been divided into "declaration and account checking" and "self-declaration and public discussion" households according to the integrity of the account books, and the others are still "fixed amount at regular intervals" households.

    After the implementation of tax collection according to the rate, many industrial and commercial households said: "Declaration and account checking and tax collection according to the rate, we have a bottom line ourselves, we know how much business we do and how much tax we pay, and our business is easier to do."

    In terms of payment time, business tax was changed from semi-annual collection to quarterly collection, and then to monthly collection. Income tax is separated from business tax, estimated and levied once in the first half of the year, and settled and cleared in the second half of the year. Increasing the number of collections and dispersing payments greatly facilitates the payment of taxes by industrial and commercial households.

    (2) Establishment of Cadre Responsibility System

    In order to implement tax collection according to the rate of industrial and commercial tax, the cadre responsibility system has been implemented since June 1950, that is, cadres are organized into several work groups to manage the tax collection work of industrial and commercial households in a certain area. Because of the responsibility, the understanding of the situation is more in-depth than before, reducing the merchants' tax evasion, and also strengthening the ties with industrialists and merchants. For example, some industrialists and merchants said to the tax bureau cadres: "Now it is convenient, we don't have to go to the tax bureau to solve problems, just wait for you to come to our home." In the work of the responsibility system, the work of the leaders of industrial and commercial groups is worthy of attention. Through them, the work of industrial and commercial tax in the city has been promoted, and the activists have played a leading role.

    (3) Establishment and Registration of Account Books

    The condition for tax collection according to the rate is to have a true business record, so that it is possible to achieve a fair and reasonable burden. Therefore, first of all, those without accounts should establish accounts, and those with accounts should improve them. Those who really have no ability to establish accounts, even small shops, should be allowed to be exempted from establishing accounts, and old and newly established accounts should be registered.

    The establishment of account books can also promote the establishment of an economic accounting system for industrial and commercial households. Up to now, 20,000 of the city's 43,000 industrial and commercial households have registered their account books.

    (4) Establishment of a Unified Invoice System for Stationary Merchants

    The unified invoice is to prevent the sale of goods without issuing invoices, tax evasion of business tax and other taxes, in order to protect legitimate industry and commerce; on the other hand, the unified invoice is stamped with a stamp tax remittance stamp, which also saves the procedures for affixing stamps. At present, more than 15,000 of the city's 43,000 industrial and commercial households have used unified invoices, which are being gradually promoted.

    (5) Improvement of the Tax Collection Method for Street Vendors

    In the past, street vendors were taxed according to their capital amount. Since the summer of 1950, the method of evaluating the tax amount by combining the capital amount with the business situation has been adopted. However, since the change of the "democratic appraisal" of stationary merchants to the self-declaration of business volume and tax collection according to the rate, because street vendors do not pay taxes according to the business volume, the tax burden is low, and they can compete with stationary merchants in business. In particular, some abnormally developed street vendors, whose scale exceeds that of medium-sized stationary merchants, in order to balance the burden and maintain the business of stationary merchants, since October 1950, unified invoices have been implemented for larger street vendors (about 6,000 households), and taxes are collected according to the business volume and paid monthly. Since its implementation, tax revenue has increased compared to before, and the general feedback is very good, believing that paying more taxes for more money and less taxes for less money is indeed more fair and reasonable than in the past.

    (6) In terms of commodity tax, small factories have changed from assessed collection to collection according to actual output, overcoming the imbalance of the burden that the assessed output is lower or higher than the actual output.

    (7) Simplify Procedures

    In order to facilitate merchants and benefit the people as much as possible, tax procedures are simplified as much as possible.

    1.  Commodity tax: A, Avoid manufacturers waiting for the opening of the certificate, during the period of inventory tax supplement. Use the payment voucher instead of the tax certificate. B, In order to save the procedures for both the public and private parties, for taxable goods sold in the city, use the shipping invoice instead of the transportation certificate. C, In order to facilitate manufacturers to sell goods in time. For sporadic products, the inspection and verification will be affixed by the manufacturer itself, and a sampling inspection method will be implemented.

    2.  Stamp tax: In order to solve the difficulties for small merchants in issuing invoices and reduce the trouble of affixing stamps, it has been partially implemented to collect together with temporary commercial tax, transaction tax, and slaughter tax.

    3.  Street vendor license tax: The back of the street vendor license is printed with a registration form for the collection of license tax and land rent. When paying the payment, no receipt is issued, only the tax amount is indicated on the form and stamped, saving the street vendor's time.

    4.  The number of vouchers for slaughter tax used to be eleven, which has been simplified to three.

    Problems existing in Beijing's tax collection work and future improvement directions: Although Beijing's tax collection work has achieved great results in the past year, there are still many shortcomings: First of all, the serious tax evasion. According to the statistics of the Sixth Tax Bureau's two inspections of business tax in August and November last year, among the tax evasion households found, the undeclared business volume was about 35% of the original declaration, and a few households even had undeclared amounts of several times. Secondly, there is still the phenomenon of arrears. In the climax of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, most industrialists and merchants in this city have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and actively competed to pay taxes, but a few households still have a wait-and-see attitude and procrastination, and individual ones even stubbornly refuse to pay. Thirdly, the tax burden of itinerant merchants and larger street vendors is relatively low in terms of their business, which is not conducive to the development of stationary merchants. On the part of stationary merchants, according to general feedback, the actual tax amount paid by "self-declaration and public discussion" households is lower than the tax amount payable, and the fixed amount households are even lower. For example, the result of the survey of 67 "fixed amount" households in 16 industries by the Fourth Tax Bureau in November showed that the average actual business volume was about 200% to 300% of the fixed business volume. That is, the actual tax amount paid is only equal to 50% to 33% of the tax amount payable. It can be seen from this that the tax collection methods of "self-declaration and public discussion" and fixed amount are relatively unscientific and unreasonable. Therefore, the effort direction of Beijing's tax collection work in 1951 should be to continue to improve the collection methods under the spirit of implementing the new tax law, strengthen the work of the cadre responsibility system, promote the unified invoice system, further improve the account books of industrial and commercial households, block tax evasion, eliminate arrears, adjust the tax burden, and further achieve fairness and reasonableness. The tax bureau should also improve the organizational structure, strengthen the education of tax workers, continue to improve the work style, and more closely connect with the vast taxpayers in the city, so that Beijing's tax collection work can achieve greater results than in 1950.

　　北京解放第二年的税收工作
    北京市人民政府税务局副局长  马应中
    北京市一九五○年的税收工作，在正确地执行税收政策下，超过了原计划的百分之三十五，保证了财政开支，并且配合了稳定金融物价的工作。这种成绩的获得，主要的是工商业营业情况的好转。同时也由于上级的正确领导及广大市民特别是工商业者在纳税方面对政府的支持和税务干部的辛勤工作与税务工作的不断改进。
    当一九五○年四月征收四九年下半年工商业税时，正值全国工商业遭受暂时的困难，为此，政府曾对纳税困难户分别执行了减、免、缓的照顾。自五月以后，政府采取了一系列的调整工商业、调整税收的措施，工商业情况即逐渐好转，各业营业额逐月增加。根据市税局的调查材料：一般行业秋季营业额较春季的增加百分之四十五，冬季营业额较春季约增加一倍以上。因此就能够使我们的税收增加，超过了原订计划。在总税收当中各项税收所占的比例如下：私营工商业税百分之二三·四三，公营企业工商税百分之一五·九一，临时商业税百分之八·一三，货物税百分之二一·三九，印花税百分之一○·四五，房地产税百分之六·八二，其他税收百分之一三·八七。
    其次，在税务干部方面，北京市的税务干部绝大部分是解放后新参加人民政府工作的。他们经过了学习，思想与作风有很大进步。工作情绪一直是饱满的。税收工作十分繁重，但干部数量不足，他们不辞辛苦地工作，晚上时常要加班，甚至星期日也不得休息。在五○年底的考绩评核运动中，北京市税务局所属一、四○○余名干部中，涌现出一一九名模范工作者。北京市税收工作之获得成绩，是与全体干部的努力分不开的。
    在工作方法的改进方面，一九五○年我们所拟定的工作目标是克服季节性税收的逾期补征，集中缴纳筹款的困难，纠正税负不平衡的现象，并尽量简化手续以便商利民。采取了以下措施：
    （一）工商业税征收办法的改进
    一九四九年度工商业税采用“民主评议”的办法。即自上而下分配总的税收任务，自下而上民主评议每户税额，这种办法不是依照实际营业额按税率计征，具有很大的估计性，因而就产生了税负畸轻畸重的现象。同时，营业税与所得税合并半年征收一次，集中交纳，工商业者感到筹款困难。
    为了克服税负的不平衡，安定工商业者的经营情绪，保证税收，征收一九五○年春季和夏季营业税时即改为“自报公议”和在自报公议基础上“定期定额”两种办法。“自报公议”是自报营业额，经评定以后，依照税率征收。结果各户负担得到适当调整。税收亦有增加。自一九五○年下半年度起，完全按照中央规定的三种办法征收，将上半年“自报公议”户，按账簿健全程度划分为“申报查账”与“自报公议”两种户，其他仍为“定期定额”户。
    实行依率计征以后，许多工商业户说：“申报查账依率计征，我们自己有了底，知道做多少买卖纳多少税，我们的生意好做了。”
    在缴纳时间上，营业税由半年征收改为按季征收，又改为按月征收。所得税与营业税分开，上半年度估征一次，下半年度汇算清缴。征收次数增多，分散缴纳，对工商业户缴纳税款有很大的便利。
    （二）建立干部专责制
    为了实行依率计征工商业税，自一九五○年六月起实行干部专责制，即是将干部组成若干工作组，分别掌管一定地区的工商业户税收工作，由于专责，了解情况较前深入，减少了商人的偷漏，同时也密切了与工商业者的联系。如有的工商业者对税局干部说：“现在可方便了，我们有问题不必到税局去，在家等你们来就办了。”在专责制工作中，工商业小组长的工作是值得重视的，通过他们推动了全市工商业税的工作，其中的积极分子更起了带头作用。
    （三）建立和登记账簿工作
    依率计征的条件，是要有确实的营业记载，这样才可能作到负担的公平合理，因此，首先要使无账者建账，有账者健全。其确无建账能力的连家小铺准免立账，旧账和新建的账均应进行登记。
    在建账工作中并可促进工商业户经济核算制度的建立。截至目前为止，全市四万三千多工商业户中，已有二万户登记了账簿。
    （四）建立座商统一发货票制度
    统一发货票是为了防止销货不开发票，偷漏营业税及其他税收，以保护正当的工商业；另一方面统一发货票上盖有印花汇缴戳，也节省了贴印花的手续。目前全市四万三千多工商业户中已使用统一发货票的有一万五千多户，正逐步推行。
    （五）改进摊贩的征税办法
    摊贩过去是按照资本额课征牌照税的，自一九五○年夏季起，采取资本额结合营业情况评议税额的办法。但自座商由“民主评议”改为自报营业额依率计征后，因摊贩不是根据营业额纳税。税负低，在营业上可以与座商竞争。特别是某些畸形发展的摊贩，其规模超过中等座商，为了平衡负担，维护座商营业，自一九五○年十月起对较大摊贩（约六千户）实行统一发货票，根据营业额依率计征，按月缴纳。自实行以来，税收较前增加，一般反映很好，认为多卖钱多纳税，少卖钱少纳税，的确比过去公平合理。
    （六）货物税方面，小型厂商由查定征收改为按实际产量征收，克服了查定产量低于或高于实际产量的负担不平衡现象。
    （七）简化手续
    为了尽量地便商利民，税收手续方面力求简化
    一、货物税：甲、避免厂商等候开照，在存货补税期间。以缴款书代替税照。乙、为了节省公私两方手续，对市内销售的已税货品，以发货票代替运照。丙、为了便利厂商及时售货。对零星产品将查验证交厂商自贴，实行抽查办法。
    二、印花税：为了解决小商开发票的困难，减去实贴印花的麻烦，曾部分地实行了与临时商业税、交易税、屠宰税合并征收。
    三、摊贩牌照税：在摊贩牌照后面附印征收牌照税及用地租金记载表，缴款时不再开收据，只在表上注明税款盖戳，节省了摊贩的时间。
    四、屠宰税的票证过去有十一种，经简化为三种。
    北京税收工作中存在的问题及今后改进方向：北京税收工作一年来虽获得很大成绩，但还存在着许多缺点：首先是漏税的严重，根据税务六分局去年八月及十一月两次检查营业税的统计，在查获的漏税户中，漏报营业额约为原报数的百分之三十五，有少数户竟有漏报达数倍者。其次是还有滞纳的现象，在抗美援朝的高潮中，本市工商业者大多数发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，踊跃争先纳税，但有少数户还存在着观望心理、拖延态度，个别的甚至顽抗不缴。再其次是行商及较大摊贩按其营业来说，税负是比较低的，这是不利于发展座商的。在座商方面，据一般反映“自报公议”户的实纳税额较应纳税额为低而定期定额户则更低，如税务四分局十一月间调查十六个行业六十七个“定期定额”户的结果，平均实际营业额约相当于固定了的营业额百分之二○○到百分之三○○。即实纳税额仅等于应纳税额的百分之五○到百分之三十三。由此可见“自报公议”和定期定额的征税方法都是比较不科学的，不合理的。因此一九五一年北京市税收工作的努力方向应该是在贯彻新税法精神下继续改进征收方法，加强干部专责制工作，推广统一发货票制度，进一步健全工商业户的账簿，堵塞偷漏税，消灭滞纳，调整税负，进一步达到公平合理。税局并应健全组织机构，加强税工人员的教育，继续改进工作作风，更密切地联系全市广大的纳税者，使北京市的税收工作获得比一九五○年更大的成绩。
