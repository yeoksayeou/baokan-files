　　New China Vigorously Develops Maternal and Child Health Work
    广设妇幼医院、托儿所、保健站等
    【本报讯】在中央人民政府卫生部领导下，全国妇幼卫生工作已迅速开展。各大行政区及省市卫生部门都设立了妇幼保健处、妇幼保健卫生科等机构。在农村、工矿及城市市区中，建立了妇幼保健站四百零八个，妇幼保健院和妇幼保健所七十八处。此外，又建立了妇产科医院、妇幼医院、助产院、妇产科诊所、儿童医院及诊所等。据不完全统计，妇产科床位有四千三百十二个，儿童床位二千一百十九个。某些城市则出现了民办公助的妇幼保健网或站，如北京市在解放后建立了全市的妇幼保健网，以各区的产院、医院或卫生所及妇幼保健所为中心，将各区开业妇产科医师与助产士组织成为保健网。沈阳市把街区的助产士组织起来，成立了妇幼保健站。许多医师同样成立产院或医院。上海蓬莱区和天津市，更组成了妇幼保健协会及妇幼保健委员会。
    中央卫生部为推广工厂、农村妇幼卫生工作，组织了妇幼卫生工作大队，分赴山西榆次专区与天津中纺厂协助建立工厂与农村的基层组织——妇幼保健站。在将近六个月的时期中，仅在天津就建立了十个工厂妇幼保健站，训练、培养了七十四个工厂妇幼工作者，开办并改善了两个托儿所。东北各工矿部门亦建立了妇幼保健工作。炼钢厂、重机厂设立了助产站两处，抚顺矿务局在妇幼保健组织下更设立了助产站二十处。其次，为了逐步地在普及基础上提高妇幼保健工作的技术，在首都建立了妇幼保健实验院。
    在儿童保健设施方面，也充分表现出新中国的儿童正在走向幸福的生活，如内蒙在解放前根本没有托儿所的组织，解放后就开始建立；东北区以前只有三个托儿所，解放后就增加到二百八十六个；华东区原有七十五个，解放后增至二百八十六个。据不完全统计，现全国有托儿所七百八十四所，收容儿童数为三万三千零二十八名。
    培养妇幼工作干部，是一件重要工作。现全国有公私立产科学校八十一所，学生八千八百九十人，去年一年中毕业一千五百余人。医科大学妇幼学院与医学院，则培养妇产科及小儿科医师。各地并陆续开办了保育训练班。现全国已培养保育员二千一百人。改造旧产婆的工作，全国各地正在广泛进行中，据去年八月底统计，已有三万八千九百多个旧产婆受到改造教育。
    在妇幼卫生宣传教育方面，中央卫生部曾协助地方卫生部门编印了一套《新法接生挂图》、《怎样预防儿童传染病》。中央妇幼卫生工作队、防疫队及通州卫生实验区，根据工作地区的实际情况编印了《女工卫生手册》、《乡村妇幼保健员教材》及卫生歌曲和剧本等。（中央卫生部妇幼卫生局）

　　New China Vigorously Develops Maternal and Child Health Work
    Widely Establishes Maternal and Child Health Hospitals, Nurseries, Health Stations, etc.
    [By Our Correspondent] Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, national maternal and child health work has developed rapidly. Maternal and child health departments and maternal and child health sections have been established in the health departments of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities. In rural areas, industrial and mining areas, and urban areas, 408 maternal and child health stations and 78 maternal and child health hospitals and clinics have been established. In addition, obstetrics and gynecology hospitals, maternal and child hospitals, midwifery hospitals, obstetrics and gynecology clinics, children's hospitals and clinics have also been established. According to incomplete statistics, there are 4,312 obstetrical beds and 2,119 pediatric beds. In some cities, publicly-assisted maternal and child health networks or stations have emerged. For example, Beijing established a city-wide maternal and child health network after liberation, with maternity hospitals, hospitals or health clinics, and maternal and child health clinics in various districts as the center, organizing practicing obstetricians and midwives in various districts into a health network. Shenyang organized street midwives and established maternal and child health stations. Many doctors have also established maternity hospitals or hospitals. The Penglai District of Shanghai and Tianjin have also formed maternal and child health associations and maternal and child health committees.
    In order to promote maternal and child health work in factories and rural areas, the Central Ministry of Health organized a maternal and child health work team, which went to Yuci Prefecture in Shanxi and the Zhongfang Factory in Tianjin to assist in establishing grassroots organizations—maternal and child health stations—in factories and rural areas. In nearly six months, ten factory maternal and child health stations were established in Tianjin alone, training and cultivating seventy-four factory maternal and child health workers, and opening and improving two nurseries. Maternal and child health work has also been established in various industrial and mining sectors in the Northeast. The steel plant and the heavy machinery plant have established two midwifery stations, and the Fushun Mining Bureau has established twenty midwifery stations under the maternal and child health organization. Secondly, in order to gradually improve the technology of maternal and child health care on the basis of popularization, a maternal and child health experimental hospital was established in the capital.
    In terms of children's health care facilities, it also fully demonstrates that the children of New China are moving towards a happy life. For example, Inner Mongolia had no nursery organizations at all before liberation, but began to establish them after liberation; the Northeast region previously had only three nurseries, but after liberation, the number increased to 286; East China originally had 75, but after liberation, it increased to 286. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 784 nurseries nationwide, accommodating 33,028 children.
    Training maternal and child health cadres is an important task. There are currently 81 public and private obstetrics schools nationwide, with 8,890 students, and more than 1,500 students graduated last year. Medical university maternal and child health colleges and medical colleges train obstetricians, gynecologists, and pediatricians. Various regions have also successively opened childcare training courses. Currently, 2,100 nursery workers have been trained nationwide. The work of transforming old midwives is being carried out extensively throughout the country. According to statistics at the end of August last year, more than 38,900 old midwives have received transformation education.
    In terms of maternal and child health publicity and education, the Central Ministry of Health has assisted local health departments in compiling and printing a set of "New Method Delivery Charts" and "How to Prevent Children's Infectious Diseases." The Central Maternal and Child Health Work Team, the Anti-epidemic Team, and the Tongzhou Health Experimental Zone have compiled and printed "Manual for Female Workers' Health," "Textbook for Rural Maternal and Child Health Workers," health songs, and scripts based on the actual conditions of the work areas.
