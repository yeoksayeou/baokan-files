At the end of the movement, each unit will also elect model figures or model units who abide by laws and discipline, and formulate a covenant on supporting the government and cherishing the people for the unit, so that this movement will be integrated into regular work.

Now, many commanders and fighters are welcoming the development of the movement to support the government and cherish the people with practical actions to help the masses.

Some troops have decided to save the expenses of the Spring Festival dinner to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers and the poor masses in the驻地.

    军区及三野各部检查拥政爱民工作
    【新华社上海三十日电】华东各地已普遍展开拥护军队、优待烈士和军人家属的运动。各地人民政府规定了春节前后的一个月为“拥军优属运动月”，在群众中间广泛进行拥军、优属的思想教育。各地并已决定在春节期间举行军民座谈会、联欢会、向烈士及军人家属送光荣灯，在条件可能的地区，将邀请烈士家属及军人家属看电影。
    为了帮助贫苦的烈士家属、军人家属过好春节，各地人民政府正在拨发救济粮，据上海、苏北、苏南、皖南、福建等地区的统计，决定拨放的救济粮达六百一十五万斤。各地救济粮争取于春节前五日发放完毕。上海市各区已经召开或正在召开中的各界人民代表会议都讨论了拥军优属工作。该市新成区决定在春节中包演电影，招待驻军及烈士、军人和工作人员家属。该区八千多工商业户，发起了劳军的捐献运动。全区劳作美术教师，决定做一千对红灯，在除夕送上烈士家属和军人家属家门。
    【新华社上海三十日电】人民解放军华东军区及第三野战军各部以检查执行政府法令和遵守群众纪律为主要内容，展开了拥政爱民的各项活动。各部已普遍采取座谈会、访问和请政府人员、劳动模范作报告的方式，广泛征集驻地政府和各界人民的意见。上海警备部队曾在一月十六日至十九日的四天内分别邀请驻地政府、群众团体与各界人民的代表举行座谈会。驻农村的部队也组成很多访问小组，分别征集驻地政府与群众的意见。剿匪部队都派出专人去战地或委托当地政府征集群众意见。

    现在许多部队的指战员正以帮助群众的实际行动，来迎接拥政爱民运动的开展。皖南军区部队已发起每人替群众做一件事的运动。有的部队的指战员已决定把春节聚餐费用节省下来，慰问驻地的烈士家属、军人家属和贫苦群众。
