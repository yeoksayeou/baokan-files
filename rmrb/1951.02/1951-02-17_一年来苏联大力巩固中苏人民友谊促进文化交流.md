Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance a year ago, the Soviet people have widely introduced the situation of New China through newspapers, radio broadcasts, reports, exhibitions, and art performances, which has played an extremely important role in consolidating the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and promoting Sino-Soviet cultural exchange.

In addition to regularly reporting Chinese news in newspapers, Soviet magazines have published many articles and poems about New China. For example, the magazine "Bolshevik" published "The Rising People's Republic of China" and "The Economic Achievements of the People's Republic of China"; the magazine "New Times" published "The International Significance of the Chinese People's Victory," "The Historical Significance of the Chinese People's Victory," "The Construction of the People's Republic of China," "China's Economic Problems," Professor Nurzhin's "Travels in China" (by a biologist), Aslanova's "At the Asian Women's Conference," Telsky's "Impressions of Beijing," the famous painter Fenogenov's "Impressions of China," etc.; the magazine "Economic Issues" published "A Year of Great Reform in the People's Republic of China" and "The Land Policy of the Chinese Communist Party"; the magazine "Foreign Trade" published "The Economic Development of the People's Republic of China," "The Economic and Foreign Trade Development of the People's Republic of China," and "The Great Historical Victory of the Chinese People"; the magazine "Young Bolshevik" published Mikhailov's "China in Revival" (by the secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League), Melgolyang's "Unforgettable Meeting" (by the secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Youth League), Rozhneva's "Our Friends," Teliushin's "The Youth of New China," Zvagina's "You Brought Us Spring," Fodoven's "Chinese Young Patriots," the famous film director Varlamov's "The Films of New China," Shavadskaya's "The Art of Democratic China," etc.; "Soviet Women" published "Daughters of China" by Chichitkina, describing figures such as Kang Keqing and Tian Guiying, Klivtsov's "Visiting a Chinese Peasant Woman's Home" and "Women of Free China," etc.; the magazine "Young Pioneer Captain" published Irina's "In New China" (by the head of the Department of Children and Adolescents of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League) and Georgieva's "Young Pioneers of Free China"; the magazine "Star" published Chairman Mao's Long March poems, the March of the Eighth Route Army, Dukinskaya and Sersayev's "The Birth of New China," Kochitov's "Chinese Drama Fighting for People's Democracy," etc.

The Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' delegation that visited China, the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League delegation to China, the Soviet delegation that attended the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference in Beijing, and the Soviet representatives who visited China with the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, after returning to the Soviet Union, wrote articles in newspapers and magazines, gave radio speeches on the radio, and introduced the situation of New China and the lives of the Chinese people at various rallies held in various places. The famous Soviet writer Simonov made a report on his visit to China to the voters of the Supreme Soviet deputies in the Smolensk, Kaluga, and Bryansk regions. Dubrovina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federal Republic, has given dozens of lectures on China. The famous singer Shmelyov has introduced New China to the Soviet army, university students, and musicians at peace rallies, concerts, and radio stations in various places. He recently won the runner-up award at the All-Soviet Music Performance for singing Moratli's famous song "Moscow-Beijing." After returning to China, the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League delegation to China reported on their impressions of their visit to China at youth activist conferences held in Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of all the allied republics and many large cities. The Soviet representatives who participated in the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation to China also introduced New China at various youth gatherings and radio stations, which were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Soviet youth.

In the 1950 All-Soviet Painters' Paintings exhibition recently held at the Tretyakov Art Gallery in Moscow, the painter Nalbandian's color painting "Great Friendship" and Fenogenov's pencil drawing attracted great attention from visitors. They both depicted the great meeting between Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong. Fenogenov's portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and other works about the lives of the Chinese people were highly valued by the audience.

The Chinese Art Exhibition sponsored by the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers was exhibited in Moscow for one and a half months from October 1 last year, with 200,000 visitors; it was later exhibited in Leningrad for 38 days, with more than 100,000 visitors. Visitors expressed warm praise for Chinese ancient and modern art and placed great hope in Chinese modern art.

Since August last year, the new Chinese films "Daughter of China," "Boundless Light," "Invisible Front," and the color documentary films "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," co-produced by Chinese and Soviet filmmakers, have been successively shown throughout the Soviet Union and have been highly praised by audiences. The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, which was invited by the Soviet government to perform in the Soviet Union in October last year, has performed in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Yerevan, Baku and other places, and is now performing in Tbilisi, the capital of the Republic of Georgia. Later they will return to Moscow to perform. They are warmly welcomed everywhere. Soviet acrobats and audiences especially admire their artistic mass character and high level of skill.

Soviet radio stations attach great importance to Chinese news and important documents on China's foreign relations, and broadcast Chinese songs such as "The East is Red" and famous songs about China composed by Soviet musicians. Among them, the most popular with listeners are Moratli's "Moscow-Beijing," Terentyev's "China's Victory," Ostrovsky's "Congratulations to China," Kochimariov's "Free China," Fertlimon's "Song of China," and Kochitov's "March of the People's Liberation Army," "Young Soldiers," "Lullaby," "Liberation Day Song," "Stop War Provocateurs," etc.
