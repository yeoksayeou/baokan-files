Xinhua News Agency, Han River Front, 16th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in their heroic fighting on the Han River front, have already achieved a major victory, annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops.

　　The adventurous offensive launched by the American aggressor troops on January 25th employed a force of over 230,000 men. According to American news agencies, their invasion plan was: first, to attempt to retake Seoul; second, to prepare to invade the area north of the 38th parallel. Twenty-two days have passed since the enemy began their advance. After eighteen days and nights of active defensive operations, our troops launched a powerful counter-offensive to the south.

　　The enemy's main offensive focus was on the 80-kilometer wide front from Suwon and Icheon to Yeoju, employing four American divisions, two British brigades, two Rhee bandit divisions, remnants of the Turkish brigade, Greek troops, and a Philippine battalion. In the Wonju area, the enemy concentrated two American divisions plus a regiment, four Rhee bandit divisions, and French troops, a Dutch battalion, etc., to advance towards Hoengseong and Hongcheon, as a supporting action for the advance on Seoul. In addition, the American aggressor troops ordered three divisions, four regiments, and two battalions of the Rhee bandit army to advance northward along the east coast.

　　To crush the enemy's adventurous invasion, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army used a small force to resolutely resist the invading enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in that sector, and making their advance exceptionally slow, averaging less than 1.5 kilometers per day. In the eighteen days and nights of tenacious blocking battles, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies killed and wounded up to 10,000 enemy troops.

　　On the night of the 11th of this month, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a powerful counter-offensive in the Hoengseong area, advancing 20 to 30 kilometers in one day and night, annihilating a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and recovering Hoengseong. According to preliminary statistics, the results of our army's battle in the Hoengseong area totaled more than 12,900 American aggressor troops and Rhee bandit troops annihilated, including more than 7,300 Rhee bandit troops captured, more than 550 American troops captured, and more than 5,140 American and Rhee bandit troops killed or wounded; major captures included 57 howitzers, 10 anti-tank guns, 567 vehicles, 14 tanks, and 13 tanks destroyed and one enemy aircraft shot down.

　　汉江前线中朝部队获重大战果
　  歼美李匪军二万余
    【新华社汉江前线十六日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在汉江前线英勇作战中，业已取得歼敌两万多人的重大战果。
    此次美国侵略军从一月二十五日起发动的冒险进攻，使用了兵力二十三万余人。其侵犯计划，据美国通讯社透露：第一步妄图重占汉城；第二步准备侵占北纬三十八度线及其以北地区。自敌人开始进犯后，现已战斗二十二天。我军在经过十八昼夜积极的防御作战后，即向南发起强大反攻。
    敌军此次进攻重点置于水原、利川至骊州一线八十公里的宽正面，使用的兵力有美军四个师、英军两个旅、李匪军两个师及土耳其旅残部、希腊部队、菲律宾营等。原州地区，敌人又集中了美军两个师又一个团，李匪军四个师及法国部队、荷兰营等，向横城、洪川地区进犯，作为向汉城进犯的策应。此外美国侵略军并命李匪军三个师四个团另两个大队沿东海岸向北冒犯。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为粉碎敌人的冒险进犯，乃以少数兵力坚强抗击来犯敌军，使该方面的敌军伤亡惨重，进展异常缓慢，平均每天前进不及一点五公里。在十八昼夜顽强的阻击战斗中，中朝人民军队杀伤敌军达万人。
    本月十一日夜，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在横城地区发起强大反攻，一昼夜间即前进二十至三十公里，一举歼灭了大量敌人，并收复了横城。我军在横城地区的战果，据初步统计，共歼灭美国侵略军及李匪军一万二千九百余名，其中俘虏李匪军七千三百余名，美军五百五十余名，毙伤美军及李匪军五千一百四十余名；主要缴获有榴弹炮五十七门，战防炮十门，汽车五百六十七辆，坦克十四辆，另击毁坦克十三辆，击落敌机一架。（附图片）
