How Does "Yangtze River Literature" Carry Out Correspondent Work?
Wang Lituo

Editor's Note: The experience of "Yangtze River Literature" in carrying out correspondent work is very good. It is hoped that the editorial departments of literary journals across the country will pay attention to studying and adopting it.

"Yangtze River Literature" has been published for three volumes since its founding in June 1949. Since the revision of the first issue of the second volume, in order to further strengthen the connection between literary workers and the masses, exchange experiences of literary activities in various regions, and cultivate a group of new activists in literary activities from workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner, we have carried out the work of organizing "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents," and absorbed workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres, as well as the broad masses of amateur literary workers and literary youths to participate in our work.

Over the past ten months, the call to develop "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents" has received enthusiastic responses from various regions.

Throughout the six provinces and two cities of the Central and South China region, we have developed 832 "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents" with focus and steps, including 122 workers and staff members in factories; 110 liberated peasants, district and township cadres, folk artists, and rural intellectuals in rural areas; 176 soldiers, company cadres, and propaganda and education workers in the army; 173 staff members and cadres in government agencies and organizations; 114 members of cultural troupes in various local systems; 107 teachers and students in schools; and 30 people from other strata. In the past ten months, we have received more than 8,000 submissions and letters from them. In addition to creative works, these submissions also include reports on local literary activities, introductions of experiences, criticisms and suggestions on literary work and literary works, as well as questions from correspondents in learning literary work and creation.

From the first issue of the second volume to the sixth issue of the third volume, more than 90 of the 130 published works were written by "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents." The number of articles published in the columns "Pen Talks," "Research on Central and South China Folk Art," "Literary Correspondence," "Author and Reader," and "From the Readers" is even greater.

Using various methods to inspire and guide, consolidate the correspondents' interest in learning literature and art, and improve their literary cultivation is a central task of our editorial department that has not changed for a long time. We treat it as a serious political task. In the past ten months, we have carried out the following work for the correspondents:

(1) The entire organization of our editorial department is established to meet the needs of developing the work of "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents." In the entire work of the Yangtze River Literature editorial department, we spend most of our time and energy on the work of correspondents. We have a total of fourteen staff members in the editorial department, of which twelve participate in the work of correspondents, and nine of them specialize in the work of correspondents. Regardless of whether the correspondent has a manuscript or not, we maintain contact with the correspondent at least once a month. We provide systematic and step-by-step assistance and training to each correspondent, and conduct periodic evaluations of each correspondent's works.

(2) Responsible for handling the manuscripts sent to us by the correspondents. First of all, we try our best to publish the works of the correspondents in the journal; for some submissions that are more time-sensitive and not suitable for publication in "Yangtze River Literature," we introduce them to other newspapers and periodicals for publication. We have established a relationship of mutual exchange of manuscripts with various newspapers throughout the region, local literary journals in various provinces, and literary journals in major administrative regions across the country, and often introduce and recommend some works of correspondents that are suitable for the nature of those newspapers and journals to them; for longer works sent by correspondents, if they have a higher level, we introduce them to bookstores for publication. Up to now, the published works of correspondents include: Cao Guimei's collection of poems "The Biography of Cao Guimei," "Changes in Huaidi Township," "Memories of Shijiazhuang"; Chen Mu's collection of poems "Red Lantern"; Qiao Lin's opera "Seizing the Red Flag"; Shen Sha's collection of novels "Heroes Tempered by Fire"; Li Wenyuan's collection of poems "Devil's Trick," etc. Recently, we decided to compile and print a set of "Central and South China Mass Literature and Art Series" alone, specializing in compiling and selecting works by correspondents and workers, peasants, and soldiers.

If the level of the submission is too low, we will give our opinions and return it. We require every editor to write rejection letters to correspondents with the same serious, enthusiastic, and patient attitude. Our slogan is: "Writing rejection letters to correspondents should be like writing letters to your loved ones!" Let the correspondents get some enthusiastic encouragement and sincere and detailed criticism from every letter from the editorial department, and discover the direction for their continued efforts in writing from every letter from the editorial department. The reply letter should grasp the center and avoid empty talk and randomly putting labels. Each letter should solve at least one major problem for the correspondent.

(3) In order to strengthen the education of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought among the correspondents, we compile and print a periodical "Yangtze River Literature Correspondent" for internal use every two months or so. Three issues have been published and distributed to correspondents on schedule. Through it, we introduce some typical writing experiences to correspondents, specifically help correspondents write and study literary theory, and gradually improve the artistic ideological level and writing level of correspondents. This has played a great role in exchanging literary learning experiences among correspondents and consolidating the organization and connection of correspondents.

(4) In order to meet the correspondents' requirements in literary learning in many ways, we have specially opened a column "Literary Questions and Answers" in Yangtze River Literature to specifically answer the universal questions of the correspondents in creation or literary theory, and tell the correspondents some simple literary knowledge. This is the column that the correspondents like the most. There is also "Editor Communication" (Editor's Note: This column name is too confusing. Literary publications should correct this bad habit of abusing abbreviations), which publishes the correspondents' requirements and opinions on the publication, and absorbs correspondents to participate in the editing work. In addition, it also publishes the editorial department's analysis and correction of the universal shortcomings existing in the correspondents' submissions. "From the Readers" is a "window" for correspondents to reflect the masses' criticisms and suggestions on literary work and literary works. In addition, we have "Exercises," which specializes in publishing submissions from correspondents with certain content but less processing. Such as other "Writing Talks" and "Exercise Opinions" are specifically for the service of correspondents. The former tells the correspondents some basic knowledge or experience of writing, and the latter is the analysis and evaluation of the works of the correspondents. "Author and Reader" is a garden for correspondents and professional writers to freely exchange opinions. Correspondents often ask their beloved writers here to answer: "What have you been doing recently?" "Why haven't you written new works?" For example, the second issue of the third volume of "Yangtze River Literature" published "Lini's Letter to Wang Airen, a Correspondent of This Journal." There are also correspondents here who ask the original author of a work that he loves to read to tell him how to write this successful and excellent work, such as Xi Hong's answer to correspondent Chen Wei in the third issue of the third volume, "About the Writing of 'Home'." Correspondent Lu Geng—an auto worker—asked us to forward a letter to the poet Li Ji, and he wrote: "Will you feel strange when you receive this letter? Don't worry, we are not strangers. Since the day I read your 'Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang,' a healthy and brave person appeared in my imagination, holding a pen like a gun and writing revolutionary articles. I don't know if this fantasy is correct? And you? You will never know that there is an auto worker who is seventeen or eighteen years old, loves literature, is enthusiastic about work, loves you, blesses you, and wants to shake your hand!" Here are also criticisms of writers' works by correspondents, such as Wang Hongyan's opinions on "The Wooden Boat" and the self-criticism of Tian Tao, the author of "The Wooden Boat," in the fourth issue of the third volume. Here is filled with the enthusiasm of correspondents for writers' encouragement and love. This is a bridge for the exchange of voices between correspondents and writers.

(5) In order to help correspondents more effectively, we have expanded the editing work to all professional literary workers in the Central and South China region. We often absorb and organize more than sixty accomplished professional literary workers to serve as correspondents, and specially established a "Literary Advisory Committee" to answer the difficult questions raised by correspondents in creation and literary learning, revise manuscripts for correspondents, write exercise opinions, or introduce some basic writing knowledge and their own creative experience.

(6) Hold literary lectures, select the most urgent problems that correspondents need to solve that universally exist in ideology and creation, and hire professionals to explain. The effect of this is very good. We often convene symposiums for active correspondents to exchange experiences in learning literature and discuss some issues. More often, we invite some correspondents to the editorial department to talk. In addition, we also hold literary evenings and absorb correspondents to participate in various literary activities held by the literary and art circles, such as the Lu Xun Memorial Meeting and the literary and art circles' demonstration parade against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. Through these activities, we inspire and guide correspondents' interest in learning literature and consolidate the organization of correspondents, which has also been very effective.

Thanks to the efforts of all the staff of the editorial department, we have established a close friendship with the correspondents from an emotional point of view. This friendship is a solid foundation for consolidating the work of "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents." The correspondents regard the staff of the editorial department as their closest friends, and they often tell us about their ideological and life problems and things other than writing. The editors who manage the correspondents in various provinces often feel that it is their most pleasant thing to tell other editors as much as possible about the various situations of the correspondents they are familiar with. We often receive letters from correspondents pointing out the shortcomings in our literary movement, some places that should have established literary organizations have not yet been established, some of our published literary books and periodicals still have many shortcomings, some of our performing drama programs are inappropriate, and the reflection of the masses' real struggles and liberation life is not correct. These living criticisms and supervision from the masses are a powerful spur to the forward development of the entire new literary movement in the Central and South China region.

From more than 800 Yangtze River Literature Correspondents, we have discovered many excellent works: such as "Busy," "Cao Guimei's Self-Study Record," "Carpenter," "The Cultural Commander is Us," "Devil's Trick," "Land Returns Home," "Anti-Feudal Foreman," etc. The most prominent features of these works are that the content and form are very vivid, rich, and lively, the theme is fresh, the artistic conception is profound, and they are full of healthy and heroic emotions, and have a very distinct national style. The authors are mostly workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their intelligence and talents were imprisoned for a long time, and they have only begun to develop in the current people's era.

As soon as the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea began, the number of letters and submissions to the editorial department increased several times. In order to meet the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of correspondents and further consolidate and expand the organization of "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents" to participate in the propaganda movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect the country and defend the family, the editorial department has successively convened three Wuhan correspondents' symposiums according to the development of this movement. Many "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents" have joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and are today fighting with guns alongside the Korean People's Army against the aggression of U.S. imperialism.

The work of organizing "Yangtze River Literature Correspondents" is only a beginning. The experience we have gained is still very superficial and fragmented. So far, we have not had time to study these experiences well. What is discussed here is only an overview of our ten-month exploration process. We hope to get all-round guidance and help us continue to expand this movement.

　　《长江文艺》是怎样开展通讯员工作的？
    王黎拓
    编者按：《长江文艺》开展通讯员工作的经验很好，希望全国各文艺刊物编辑部门都能够注意研究采用。
    《长江文艺》从一九四九年六月创刊起，现在已经出满了三卷。自二卷一期改版后，为了进一步加强文艺工作者与群众的联系，交流各地文艺活动的经验，有计划，有步骤地从工农兵及其干部中培养出一批新的文艺活动积极分子，开展了组织“长江文艺通讯员”的工作，吸收工农兵群众及其干部和广大业余文艺工作者、文艺青年来参加我们的工作。
    十个月来，发展“长江文艺通讯员”的号召，获得了各地热烈的响应。
    在遍及中南区六省二市，我们有重点有步骤地发展了八百三十二个“长江文艺通讯员”，其中包括工厂的工人、职员一二二人；农村的翻身农民、区乡干部、民间艺人、乡村知识分子一一○人；部队的战士、连队干部、宣教工作者一七六人；机关团体的职员、干部一七三人；各地方系统的文工团团员一一四人；学校的教员、学生一○七人；其他各阶层三○人。在十个月中，我们收到他们的来稿与信件八千多篇。这些稿件除了创作外，还有对当地文艺活动情况的报导，经验的介绍和对文艺工作与文艺作品的批评、建议，以及通讯员在学习文艺工作和创作上的问题。
    从二卷一期至三卷六期，我们发表的一百三十多篇创作中，“长江文艺通讯员”的作品占九十多篇。至于《笔谈会》、《中南民间艺术研究》、《文艺通讯》、《作者与读者》、《读者中来》栏发表的通讯员的文章数量就更多。
    用各种方法来启发、诱导、巩固通讯员的学习文艺的兴趣，提高他们的文艺修养，是我们编辑部的一个长期不变更的中心工作。我们是把它当作一个严肃的政治任务来执行的。在十个月当中，我们对通讯员进行了下面的一些工作：
    （一）我们的整个编辑部的组织，是服从于发展“长江文艺通讯员”工作的需要而建立的。在整个长江文艺编辑部的工作中，我们以绝大部分时间和精力，用在通讯员工作上。我们编辑总共有十四个工作人员，其中就有十二个人参加通讯员工作，内中又有九人专作通讯员工作。不管通讯员有稿无稿，每月至少主动保持和通讯员联系一次。对每一个讯通员进行着有系统有步骤的帮助和培养，分期对每一个通讯员的作品进行评结。
    （二）负责处理通讯员寄给我们的稿件。首先，在刊物上尽量发表通讯员的作品；对一些时间性较强，不适合于《长江文艺》发表的，便介绍到其他报刊上发表。我们与全区各种报纸，各省的地方文艺刊物，及全国各大行政区的文艺刊物大都建立了互相交换稿件的关系，常介绍推荐一些适合于那些报纸刊物性质的通讯员的作品给他们；对于通讯员寄来的较长的作品，如具备较高的水平，便介绍到书店出版。截至目前，通讯员作品出版的计有：曹桂梅的诗集《曹桂梅小传》，《槐底乡变迁》，《回忆石家庄》；陈牧的诗集《红灯》；乔林的歌剧《夺红旗》；沈沙的小说集《火炼过的英雄》；李文元的诗集《鬼计》等。最近，我们决定单独编印一套《中南群众文艺丛书》，专门编选通讯员及工农兵群众的作品。
    来稿水平过低，我们就提意见退回。我们要求每一个编辑，同样以严肃、热情、耐心的态度来给通讯员写退稿信。我们的口号是：“给通讯员写退稿信，就要像给自己爱人写信一样！”让通讯员从每一封编辑部的来信里，都能得到一些热情的鼓励和诚恳而又有详尽的批评，从每一封编辑部的来信里都能发现他在写作上继续努力的方向。回信要抓住中心，避免空洞和乱扣帽子。每封信至少要给通讯员解决一个主要问题。
    （三）为了在通讯员中加强毛主席文艺思想的教育，每隔两个多月我们便编印一种《长江文艺通讯员》的对内的不定期刊。现在已经出版了三期，按期赠发给通讯员，通过它对通讯员介绍一些典型的写作经验，具体帮助通讯员写作与研究文艺理论，逐步提高通讯员的艺术思想水平和写作水平。这对通讯员交流文艺学习的经验，巩固通讯员的组织与联系，都起了很大的作用。
    （四）为了多方面满足通讯员在文艺学习上的要求，我们在长江文艺上特辟了《文艺问答》栏，专门解答通讯员在创作上或文艺理论上带有普遍性的问题，告诉通讯员一些简单的文艺知识，这是通讯员最喜欢的一栏。另有《编通往来》（编者按：这个栏名太费解，文艺刊物应当纠正这种滥用省略的坏习气），刊载通讯员对刊物的要求和意见，吸收通讯员参加编辑工作，除此也发表编辑部对通讯员来稿中所存在的普遍性的缺点的分析与指正。《读者中来》是供给通讯员反映群众对文艺工作与文艺作品的批评与建议的“窗户”。另外，我们设有《习作》，专门发表通讯员来稿中有一定内容，但加工较少的作品。如其他《写作漫谈》《习作意见》都是具体为通讯员服务的，前者告诉通讯员一些写作的基本知识或经验，后者是对通讯员作品的分析与评介。《作者与读者》是通讯员与专业作家在一起自由交换意见的园地，通讯员常在这里要求他所敬爱的作家回答：“最近干些什么？”“为什么没有写出新作品？”如《长江文艺》三卷二期就发表了《丽尼给本刊通讯员王爱仁的信》。也有通讯员在这里请他最爱读的一篇作品的原作者，告诉他怎样写出这篇成功和出色作品的写作经验，如三卷三期西虹同志回答通讯员陈薇，“关于《家》的写作”。通讯员鲁庚——一个汽车工人，要我们转一封信给诗人李季，他这样写着：“这封信你接到手里会感觉得陌生吗？不要着急，我俩并不陌生。自从那天读过你的《王贵与李香香》后，就在我的幻想中出现一个健康、勇敢的人，拿着一只似枪的笔，写作革命的文章。这幻想不知对不对？而你呢？绝对不会晓得有个十七八岁的爱好文学，热心工作的汽车工人，在爱着你，祝福你，很想和您握次手！”在这里也有通讯员对作家作品的批评，如三卷四期，王洪延的《关于木船记》的意见和《木船记》的作者田涛同志的自我检讨。在这里充满着通讯员对作家们的热情督促和爱戴，这是通讯员与作家心声交流的一个桥梁。
    （五）为了更有效地帮助通讯员，我们把编辑工作扩大到中南区所有的专业文艺工作者中去。我们经常吸收和组织六十多个有成就的专业文艺工作者为通讯员服务，专门成立了一个“文艺顾问会”，解答通讯员所提出的创作上和文艺学习上的疑难问题，为通讯员修改稿件，写习作意见，或者介绍一些基本的写作知识与自己的创作经验。
    （六）举行文艺讲座，选择通讯员最迫切须要解决的在思想上和创作上普遍存在的问题，聘请专业讲解。这样作的效果很好。我们经常召集通讯员积极分子座谈会，交换在学习文艺中的经验和讨论一些问题，更多的是经常请一些通讯员来编辑部交谈。此外我们也举行文艺晚会，吸收通讯员参加文艺界所举行的各种文艺活动如鲁迅纪念会，文艺界抗美援朝示威大游行等，通过这些活动来启发和引导通讯员学习文艺的志趣，巩固通讯员的组织，收效也很好。
    由于编辑部的全体工作人员的努力，我们和通讯员是从情感上建立了一种密切的友谊，这种友谊就是巩固“长江文艺通讯员”工作的一个稳固的基础。通讯员是把编辑部的人员当作自己最亲密的朋友，他们常把自己除了写作以外关于思想上，生活上的问题和事情告诉我们。管理各省通讯员的编辑人员，经常互相以把自己所熟悉的通讯员的各种情况能尽量告诉其他编辑人员认为是自己最愉快的事情。我们常常接到通讯员来信，指出我们文艺运动中的缺点，某些地方的应该建立文艺组织还没有建立，有些我们出版的文艺书刊还存在着许多缺点，我们有些演出的戏剧节目不恰当，对反映群众现实的斗争与翻身生活表现得不正确。这些来自群众中活生生的批评与监督，是中南区整个新的文艺运动向前发展的有力鞭策。
    从八百多个长江文艺通讯员中，我们发现了许多优秀的作品：如《忙》，《曹桂梅自学记》，《木工》，《文化司令就是咱》，《鬼计》，《土地还家》，《反封建把头》等。这些作品的最突出的特点是内容与形式都非常生动，丰富，活泼，主题新鲜，意境深刻，充满着健康豪壮的情感，有很鲜明的民族气派。作者大都是工人，农民，战士。他们的聪明才智，长期被禁锢了，直到现在的人民时代才开始得到了发展。
    抗美援朝运动一开始，编辑部的来信和来稿数字就增加了几倍。编辑部为了满足广大通讯员的爱国热情，进一步巩固和扩大组织“长江文艺通讯员”参加抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传运动，曾先后按着这一运动的发展情况，召开了三次武汉市通讯员座谈会。有许多“长江文艺通讯员”，参加了中国人民志愿军，今天在和朝鲜人民军一起持枪战斗，反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    组织“长江文艺通讯员”的工作，还只是一个开端。我们所得到的这一点经验还很肤浅，零碎。至今我们还没有来得及把这些经验加以很好的研究。这里所谈的只是我们十个月来摸索过程的概述。希望能得到多方面的，指导帮助我们继续扩大这个运动。
