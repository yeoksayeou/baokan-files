Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　The American-owned Shanghai Power Company, the largest thermal power plant in the country, has taken on a completely new look since the Shanghai Military Control Commission implemented the State Council's decision to exercise military control. The color of the smoke billowing from the power plant's chimneys alone shows the difference from the past. Previously, the smoke was a dense black, but now, because the coal is burned thoroughly, the smoke has turned grayish-white. All the power company's documents, previously in English, are now uniformly in Chinese, a measure that all workers and staff heartily endorse. Before January 18th, the engineers personally translated all the mechanical nomenclature and technical terms into Chinese. Old worker Sun Zhenkang was so moved by this that he shed tears. He said, "My eyes have been blind for over thirty years, but now they've finally opened!" In the past, when a worker wanted to requisition materials, he would often ask for iron plates but be given steel pipes; to requisition again, he would have to ask the "gentlemen" to write another slip and sign it, wasting a lot of time. Workers in the boiler room said: in the past, the foreigners used English to direct our work, we didn't understand, and if we made mistakes, we were slapped and had to apologize. Now, we won't be subjected to that foreign airs anymore. After the company was placed under military control, the workers in each workshop immediately drew up patriotic pledges and launched a patriotic production campaign focusing on protecting machines, saving fuel, reducing coal consumption, and preventing accidents. During the New Year holiday, the worker patrol voluntarily patrolled day and night. On New Year's Day evening, when a blower motor in a certain furnace broke down, many workers rushed from their homes to repair it. Eighty engineers and workers from several units worked from 4:00 PM until dawn to complete the repairs. Workers and staff also constantly prevent accidents. Old worker Ju Shaohe saw that the outer wrapping of a water tank pipe on a transformer was about to fall off, which could cause the transformer to burn, and he quickly reported it to the supervising engineer. The workers immediately repaired it, thus avoiding a serious accident. Because the workers and staff are working as masters of their own affairs, work efficiency has significantly improved. For example, repairing the main copper plate on a generator was originally planned to take 50 days, then changed to 39 days, but in the end, it only took 34 days. Many workers have improved their operating methods. For example, when repairing the tubes on a certain boiler's economizer, it used to take three people to enlarge or tighten them. Now, old worker Gong Mingguang uses a screw to pry one end firmly, and the other end can be enlarged or tightened at will, not only saving two workers but also making the work safer. Many workers have created or improved production tools. For example, to drill thousands of holes in the iron plates used to repair generators, it used to be done with a drilling machine, which could drill a maximum of two holes per minute. Old worker Zhang Asheng used waste materials to make a manual punching machine, which can punch eight holes per minute, increasing work efficiency threefold, and the holes are smooth and neat. What makes workers and technicians happiest is that staff at all levels listen to their opinions. The suggestions made by engineers Tong Zhaocui and Sun Baofeng regarding the inspection system and statistical work have been adopted by the administration. Old worker Sun Zhenkang of the external coppersmith shop suggested to the administration that waste materials be used, and he immediately received the factory director's approval and encouragement. In the heavy snow, the union chairman accompanied him to the open space where the waste materials were piled up to select them and assigned someone to clean them up. As a result of utilizing waste materials, valuable gear oil has been filtered from long-accumulated ditches, and high-quality lead has been smelted from the lead-magnesium plates in the waste electrical boxes. Before the company was placed under military control, the union had already led the workers in launching a patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement, and the workers in each workshop had denounced the oppression and insults they had personally suffered from American imperialism for more than forty years. Now, the workers' morale is even higher.

　　美商上海电力公司军管以后气象一新
    【新华社讯】全国最大火力发电厂——美商上海电力公司，自上海军事管制委员会执行政务院决定实行军事管制以来，气象一新。从电厂烟囱里冒的煤烟的颜色也就可以看出与过去不同，过去冒的煤烟是浓黑色，而现在由于煤被烧透了，烟子已变为灰白色。电力公司所有文件，过去都用英文，现已一律改用中文，全体工人职员对这一措施，表示特别拥护。工程师们在一月十八日以前，亲自动手把全部机械的英文名称和生产术语译成中文。老工人孙贞康被这桩事情感动得流下了眼泪。他说：“我的眼睛瞎了三十多年，这一下子可开啦！”过去工人开一张领料条子，往往要领的是铁板，发给的却是钢管；重领又得请先生们再开条子、签字，往返浪费很多时间。炉子间里的工人说：过去外国人用英文指挥我们工作，听不懂，做错了就吃耳光还要赔不是，现在这股洋气可不再受了。当公司实行军事管制后，各车间工人立即订立爱国公约，开展以保护机器、节省油料、降低煤耗、防止事故等为内容的爱国主义生产竞赛。在新年假期中，工人纠察队自动日夜巡逻。元旦晚上，当某炉一只风箱马达损坏时，很多工人从家里赶来抢修。几个单位八十多位工程师和工人从下午四时一直抢修到天明。工人和职员们并时刻防止事故发生。老工人壉少和看见一部变压器上水汀管外包皮快要脱落将使变压器燃烧，他迅速地报告给主管工程师，立即由工人修好，致避免了发生严重事故。由于工人、职员们以主人翁姿态进行劳动，工作效率显著提高。如修理某发电机上的总铜牌，原计划需五十天，后来改为三十九天，而结果只用了三十四天就修好了。许多工人改进了操作方法。例如修某号炉省煤器上的管子，要烙大或烙紧时，过去要三个人才能工作，现在老工人龚明光用螺丝撬牢一端，另一端即可随意烙大或烙紧，不仅省了二个人工，做出活来还保险。有不少工人创造了或改进了生产工具，例如修理发电机所用的铁板上要打几千个眼子，过去用钻床钻，每分钟最快只能钻二个眼子；老工人张阿生自己用废料装成一个手板冲床，每分钟就能冲八个眼子，工作效率提高了三倍，而且眼子既光滑又整齐。工人和技术人员们最高兴的是各级工作人员倾听他们的意见。童肇萃、孙宝丰两位工程师所提出关于检查制度和统计工作的建议，已经被行政上所采纳。外铜匠间老工人孙贞康向行政上建议使用废料，立刻得到厂长的同意和鼓励；在大雪纷飞中，工会主任陪同他到堆放着废料的旷场上进行挑选，并派专人清理。由于利用废物，现在已从久积的阴沟中滤出昂贵的盔方棚油，在废电箱的铅镁板中炼出了成色良好的铅。在公司实行军事管制以前，工会就曾领导工人开展抗美援朝爱国运动，各车间工人都控诉了四十多年来亲身所受到的美帝国主义的压迫和侮辱。现在工人情绪更加高涨。
