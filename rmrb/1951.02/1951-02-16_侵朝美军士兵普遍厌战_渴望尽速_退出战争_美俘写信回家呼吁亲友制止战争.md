Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th – The most anxious question in the minds of many American soldiers in the Korean War is how to "withdraw from the war" as soon as possible.

According to U.S. prisoners of war, "self-inflicted wounds" are becoming increasingly common among U.S. aggressor troops. They unanimously admit that in their respective regiments, there are at least one or two such incidents every day. It is said that one regiment even had a thousand "sick" soldiers in a single day. "Self-inflicted wounds" are also common among officers. When the situation becomes serious, the officers are the first to slip away.

This desire to "withdraw from the war" is not limited to the American army. According to prisoners of war, the U.S. Second Division suffered extremely heavy losses in combat, so much so that the division had to be supplemented by Syngman Rhee's puppet army. At one point, Syngman Rhee's puppet army accounted for almost 75 percent of the division. But these puppet soldiers had a clever trick: "As soon as there was any sign of fighting, they would change into civilian clothes and scream loudly." The American aggressor troops fighting on Korean soil cannot use this trick, even though they would very much like to do so. For them, the only safe way to "withdraw from the war" besides being wounded or killed, is to become prisoners of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.

Tens of thousands of American, British, and Turkish soldiers have now "withdrawn from the war" and gone to northern Korea, far behind the front lines. These prisoners of war have houses to live in, food to eat, and clothes to wear. American planes have destroyed cities and villages so badly, and killed farmers and livestock so brutally, that some American prisoners of war are speechless when they learn of the destruction caused by these unbridled bombings and strafing. Some of them are now beginning to feel ashamed, and they now call the actions of the U.S. Air Force "shameful."

Among the American prisoners of war who have been educated in the "American way of life," reason is beginning to break through the thick prejudice that the American propaganda machine has instilled in their minds. The powerful blows of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies have shattered their complacency and made them begin to face reality. They have begun to ask: Is the military profession really as good as American advertisements portray it? American advertisements have headlines that say, "Join the army and travel." Now they have "traveled" and found that they cannot act as oppressors everywhere as they did in Japan. Now their most pressing concern is how to get home. Even some soldiers who have served in the regular army for a long time are dejectedly vowing to abandon their military careers after returning home and find a safer profession.

Some of them are now sincerely grateful to the Chinese and Korean People's Armies who captured them, because these armies treat their wounds and give them warm winter clothes to replace their flimsy American uniforms. Under the influence of this policy towards prisoners of war, some people have even admitted the crimes they committed against the Korean people when they had guns in their hands, and their shameless behavior towards Korean women.

MacArthur's fabricated lie that U.S. soldiers would be mistreated after being captured has backfired on him, not to mention the lies he fabricated about the war itself. These soldiers are using the exposure of these lies as a starting point to question why the United States is fighting in Korea. For this reason, most American prisoners of war are now beginning to write home, asking their relatives and friends to take action to stop the war of aggression against Korea. They often say, "At home, if they knew everything we know now, then this war would end tomorrow, even if it required starting a revolution at home." They are very disappointed that the American people at home do not know these facts. Therefore, many prisoners of war are asking their families in their letters home to try to "stop this mad war." One American prisoner of war wrote: "We should never have come here."

### 侵朝美军士兵普遍厌战  渴望尽速“退出战争”   美俘写信回家呼吁亲友制止战争

　　侵朝美军士兵普遍厌战
    渴望尽速“退出战争”        
    美俘写信回家呼吁亲友制止战争
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】现在许多美国侵朝军士兵心里最感焦灼的问题，是怎样尽快“退出战争”。
    据美军战俘们说，在侵略美军当中，“自伤”的事情已愈来愈多。他们一致承认，在他们各自的团里，这样的事情每天至少有一两起。据说有一团军队在一天之中竟然有一千个“病号”。“自伤”现象在军官中也很普遍。情况一严重，军官们就最先开溜。
    这种希望“退出战争”的要求，并不限于美国军队。据战俘们说，美国第二师在战斗中损失极重，以致该师必须用李承晚伪军来补充。有一个时期，李承晚伪军几乎占该师百分之七十五。但是这些伪军有一条妙计：“一看到有战斗的迹象，就换上便衣并且尖声嘶叫”。在朝鲜土地上作战的美国侵略军，却无法使用这条妙计，尽管他们也非常希望这样做。对他们来说，“退出战争”的办法，除了负伤、毙命以外，还有一个最稳当的办法，这就是做中国志愿军和朝鲜人民军的俘虏。
    成千成万的美国兵、英国兵和土耳其兵现在已经“退出战争”，到远在战线后方的朝鲜北部去了。这些战俘们有房子住，有饭吃，有衣服穿。美国飞机把城市和村庄破坏得这样厉害，把农民和牲畜杀害得这样凶，有些美军战俘在知道这种肆无忌惮的轰炸和扫射所造成的破坏时，就垂首不语。他们当中有些人现在已经开始感到羞愧，他们现在把美国空军这种行为称做是“可耻的”。
    在受过“美国生活方式”的教育的美军战俘当中，理智正在开始突破美国宣传机器灌进他们的头脑中的浓厚偏见。中朝人民军队的强有力的打击，已经打破了他们沾沾自喜的情绪，使他们开始正视现实。他们已开始问：当兵的职业是不是完全像美国广告所渲染的那样好。美国广告的标题写着：“参加军队旅行去”。现在他们已经“旅行”了一番，发现他们并不能到处都像在日本那样作威作福。现在他们最焦心的问题是怎样能回家。甚至有些干过长期正规军的士兵也沮丧地发誓回国以后一定抛弃行伍生涯，找一个比较安全的职业。
    他们当中有些人现在诚心感谢俘掳他们的中朝人民军队，因为这些军队替他们治疗创伤，发温暖的冬衣给他们，以代替他们的单薄得可怜的美式制服。在这种俘虏政策的感化下，有几个人甚至已经承认了当他们有枪在手时对朝鲜老百姓所犯的罪恶，以及他们对待朝鲜妇女的无耻行为。
    麦克阿瑟所捏造的说美军士兵在被俘后将受到虐待的谎话，已经反过来给他自己狠狠地打了一个嘴巴，更不要说他所捏造的关于战争本身的谎话了。这些士兵们就是以这些谎话的被揭穿为起点，开始怀疑为什么美国要在朝鲜作战。由于这个缘故，大多数美军俘虏现在开始写信回国，要求他们的亲友采取行动制止侵朝战争。他们常常说：“在国内，如果他们知道我们现在所知道的一切，那末这个战争明天就会结束，纵然这需要在国内发起一次革命。”他们非常失望，在国内的美国人民不知道这些事实。因此，许多俘虏在他们写的家信中都要求他们的家人设法“制止这个疯狂的战争”。有一个美军俘虏写道：“我们万万不该到这里来。”
