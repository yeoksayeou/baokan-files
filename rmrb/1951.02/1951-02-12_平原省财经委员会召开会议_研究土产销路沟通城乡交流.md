　　Plains Province Finance Committee Holds Meeting
　　Study the Marketing of Local Products and Promote Urban-Rural Exchange
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch] The Finance Committee of the Plains Provincial People's Government convened a provincial conference on local products in late December of last year to vigorously promote urban-rural material exchange and purchase local products. The conference was attended by directors of finance committees from various special districts (administrative offices) and cities, directors of cooperative societies, heads of industry and commerce sections, managers of local product companies, and responsible cadres from relevant provincial departments. After discussions, the comrades attending the meeting all accepted the spirit of the Central People's Government's current vigorous promotion of local products, understood the province's material production and sales situation, and enabled each special district and city to draw up barter and consignment agreements. In order to closely cooperate with this work, the banks have determined to issue 18 billion yuan in loans for winter and spring local products; the Tax Bureau has clarified the tax-free scope for operating local products; and transport unions have been established in transportation, and mass transportation has been organized.
　　The province has a wide variety of local products and by-products. According to statistics, there are 61 kinds, with an annual total value equivalent to approximately 645.36 million jin of rice, accounting for approximately 7.3 percent of the province's agricultural and sideline income, and more than 9.4 percent of the total agricultural income, equivalent to 82.86 percent of the province's total annual agricultural tax revenue. Therefore, vigorously promoting the sale of agricultural and sideline products is an important key to increasing farmers' income and improving farmers' purchasing power.
　　The meeting analyzed that the characteristics of local product sales in the province are two: (1) Those with relatively good sales: For example, sulfur has an average monthly output of 125,000 jin, all of which can be sold; peach kernels have an annual output of 1.09 million jin, most of which can be sold. Taking Anyang as an example, with an annual output of 690,000 jin, 635,000 jin have been sold; Sichuan peppercorns have opened up sales channels, such as Anyang with an annual output of 100,000 jin, of which more than 70,000 jin have been sold; Codonopsis pilosula has an annual output of more than 10,000 jin, all of which have been sold; Trichosanthes kirilowii has an annual output of 300,000 jin, most of which have been sold. Other products such as fur, bristles, and casings are selling well, so there is very little inventory. (2) Those that still have inventory and need to be vigorously promoted: Local products such as Huai medicine, dried persimmons, black dates, red dates, hawthorns, and straw braid still need to continue to expand sales channels; especially black dates and red dates, as long as they are vigorously promoted during the peak sales season, it will not be a problem to sell them all.
　　The meeting also affirmed the experience of various localities in promoting local products and organizing material exchange in the past. The first is to hold representative meetings and symposiums of various industries and trades in different regions, and to absorb experienced merchants and producers to participate, understand production and sales situations, and exchange experiences in a timely manner. For example, Hui County produces 2 million jin of hawthorns annually. For several years, no sales channels could be found, and farmers burned them as firewood. However, last year, the county held a representative meeting of various industries and trades. After exchanging production and sales information, 1.2 million jin were sold. Private merchants in various counties in the Xinxiang Special District responded to the call of the representative meeting and actively mobilized. The Muluan shop private firm in Wuzhi County sold more than 43,000 jin of Huai goods and transacted more than 33,000 jin of peanuts in one day. Only if everyone comes up with ideas can the promotion of local products be done well.
　　The second is to widely carry out the contract system. Credit should be mutually observed in terms of the quantity, specifications, and time of the contract. At the same time, through contracts, joint operations, processing, ordering, advance purchase, credit purchase, consignment sales, and barter methods are organized to solve funding difficulties. For example, counties to counties and districts to villages in Xinxiang and Anyang conduct purchases and sales through contracts. Hui County alone sells 1.2 million jin of hawthorns, accounting for 60 percent of the county's output. In addition, eliminating the concerns of private merchants, strengthening the organization and leadership of private merchants, and restoring the commercial network are also necessary keys to promoting urban-rural material exchange.

### 平原省财经委员会召开会议  研究土产销路沟通城乡交流

　　平原省财经委员会召开会议
　  研究土产销路沟通城乡交流
    【本报讯】平原省人民政府财经委员会为大力开展城乡物资交流，收购土产，于去年十二月下旬召开了全省土产会议。由各专（署）、市及重点县财经委员会主任、合作社主任、工商科长、土产公司经理及省级有关部门负责干部参加。出席会议同志经讨论后，都接受了中央人民政府对目前大力推销土产的精神，了解全省物资产销情况，并使各专、市之间，订出了易货代销协议。各部门为密切配合这一工作，银行确定了发放冬季与春季土产贷款一百八十亿；税务局明确了经营土产的免税范围；并且在交通上建立联运站，组织群众运输。
    该省土产、副产品繁多。据统计有六十一种，年产总值折米约六亿四千五百三十六万斤，约占全省农副业收入的百分之七点三，占农业总收入的百分之九点四强，相当全省全年农业税收的百分之八十二点八六。因此，大力推销农副产品，是增加农民收入、提高农民购买力的重要关键。
    会议分析出该省土产销售的特点有二：（一）销路较好的：如硫磺每月平均产十二万五千斤，全部可销出；桃仁年产一百零九万斤，大部可销出，以安阳为例，年产六十九万斤，已销六十三万五千斤；花椒已打开销路，如安阳年产十万斤，现已销七万余斤；党参年产万余斤已全部销出；天花粉年产三十万斤，已大部销出。其他如皮毛、猪鬃、肠衣等均畅销，故存货极少。（二）目前仍有存货而需要大力推销的：如怀药、柿饼、乌枣、红枣、山楂、草帽辫等土产尚须继续开展销路；特别是乌枣、红枣在畅销季节只要大力推销，全部销出是不成问题的。
    会议同时肯定了各地过去推销土产，组织物资交流的经验。首先是分别地区开好各行各业代表会、座谈会，并吸收有经验的商人和生产者参加，了解产销情况，及时交流经验。如辉县年产山楂二百万斤，数年来找不到销路，农民把它当柴烧，但去年该县召开了一次各行各业的代表会，交换产销情况后，就推销了一百二十万斤。新乡专区各县的私商纷纷响应代表会号召，积极地动员起来，武陟县木栾店私营行栈五天内推销怀货四万三千余斤，一天内成交花生三万三千余斤。只有大家想办法，土产推销才能作好。
    其次是广泛开展合同制。在合同的数量、规格、时间上应互守信用。同时通过合同组织联营、加工、定货、预购、赊购、代销、易货等办法，解决资金困难。如新乡、安阳两地县与县、区村与区村之间，均通过合同进行购销，只辉县推销山楂即有一百二十万斤，占该县产量的百分之六十。此外，解除私商顾虑，加强对私商的组织与领导，恢复商业网，也是沟通城乡物资交流的必要关键。
