    Model Worker Shan Lianji
    Shan Lianji, a worker at the Zhangjiakou Farm Implement Factory, invented the "milling cutter arbor," imitated the knurled daisy wheel, and repaired four cigarette-making machines under rudimentary machine equipment conditions. He also salvaged and repaired two machines, the No. 1 universal milling machine and the 16-inch shaper, from a scrap iron pile.

    Shan Lianji is only twenty-six years old this year but is already a machinist with twelve years of experience. He has good skills, but he could not use them in the old society. Zhangjiakou was liberated on December 24, 1949, and Shan Lianji was overjoyed. He worked actively and, under the cultivation and education of the Party, gloriously became a Communist Party member.

    Last April, in order to welcome Red May, the cigarette factory launched a production competition campaign. The daisy wheels controlling the tool holders of the four Japanese Showa-style dual-cut cigarette-making machines used in the cigarette rolling room had lost their specifications due to long-term wear. If these parts were not replaced in time, there was a risk of machine stoppage. Shan Lianji took on the task of imitating the daisy wheels and received encouragement from the leadership. He figured out the principle that the arc-shaped bend of the daisy wheel is a part of the entire circumference, and initially invented a cylindrical toothed milling cutter to mill out the model. Due to the lack of good steel and a grinding wheel, the teeth were not milled regularly, and there were many difficulties. Shan Lianji thought: As a Communist Party member, one must overcome difficulties. Not only did he not lose heart or become discouraged, but based on the principle of the cylindrical toothed milling cutter, he continued to study, and finally, the imitation of the daisy wheel was successful. When the good news spread, it shook the entire factory. Everyone said, "Old Shan really has a knack for it!" Last July, he went to the Xuanhua General Factory to collect materials and cleaned out a No. 1 universal milling machine, a 16-inch shaper, and the body of a 10-inch gantry planer from a scrap iron pile. After the scrap iron was pulled back to Zhangjiakou and inspected, it was found that the three machines were missing a total of one hundred and seventy-eight parts, both large and small. After studying and drawing up plans, Old Shan began to make them. Two of the three machines have now been repaired. The value of these two machines is over 300 million yuan.

    The main reason Shan Lianji created these model deeds is that he realized that it is not enough to rely solely on labor intensity when working; it is necessary to transform tools and use both hands and brains. He said, "Production is like fighting a war, and you must use your brains and advance steadily." Recently, he has also transformed tools such as a 12-inch bench vise, a 12-inch chuck, and a 13-inch turntable. The workers all said, "Under the leadership of Old Shan, the machines (brains) that we workers didn't use in the past are now also being put into motion."

    Recently, Shan Lianji was selected as a representative of Zhangjiakou City to attend the Chahar Province Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference. He said, "I didn't expect that doing these little things would be so glorious. This should be the glory of our entire factory, the entire city, and all the workers!"

    模范工人闪连吉
    张家口农具制造厂工人闪连吉，在机器设备简陋的条件下，发明了“铣刀刀杆”，仿造纽线菊花轮，修配四台卷烟机。并从废铁堆里修复了头号万能铣车、十六英寸牛头刨车等两部机器。
    闪连吉今年才二十六岁，但已经是个十二年工龄的机工。他有好技术，但在旧社会里，不能施展。一九四九年十二月二十四日，张家口解放了，闪连吉高兴的了不得。他积极工作，在党的培养和教育下，光荣地成为共产党员。
    去年四月里，纸烟厂为了迎接红五月，开展生产竞赛运动。卷烟室使用的四台日本昭和中研式两切卷烟机，控制刀架的菊花轮，因磨转日久，失去规格。这个零件不及时调换，即有停车的危险。闪连吉就担任仿造菊花轮的任务，并得到了领导上的鼓励。他捉摸着菊花轮的弧线形弯度是整圆周一部分的原理，初步发明圆桶锯齿铣刀，铣出模型来。由于缺乏好钢及砂轮床子，牙齿铣不规矩，困难挺多。闪连吉想：共产党员，要克服困难。他不但没有灰心泄气，根据着圆桶锯齿铣刀的道理，继续钻研，仿造菊花轮终于成功。喜报传出后，震动了全厂。大家都说：“老闪，真有一手！”去年七月他到宣化总厂领料，从废铁堆里清理出了头号万能铣车，十六英寸牛头刨车及十英寸龙门刨车床身三部，当废铁拉回张家口，经过一番检查，三部机器整短少大小零件一百七十八件，老闪经过研究，作图配制。现三部机器已修好了两部。这两部机器价值三亿余元。
    闪连吉创造了这些模范事迹，主要的是他认识到做工，单凭劳动强度是不够的，必须改造工具，手脑并用。他说：“生产好比打仗，必须开动脑筋，稳扎稳打。”最近他又改造了十二英寸座钳子、十二英寸卡盘和十三英寸转盘等工具。工友们都说：“在老闪的带动下，我们工人过去不用的机器（头脑），现在也开动起来了。”
    最近，闪连吉被评选为张家口市出席察哈尔省工业劳模代表会议的代表了，他说：“没想到干了这点事，还这么光荣。这应该是我们全厂、全市、全体工人的光荣！”
