    Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and Relevant Agencies Should Inspect the Jiluan River Defenses
    To the Editor:
    The situation reflected in Comrade Ren Jie's (secretary of this bureau) article "Jiluan River System River Defenses Repeatedly Damaged" published in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on January 18th is the actual situation existing in this river system. However, we are a technical agency, and our main work is technical guidance, while administrative responsibility should belong to the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the local special districts and county people's governments. We have reported these repeated damages to the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau at any time, and sent letters to the relevant agencies, but so far, these illegal acts of destruction have not been effectively stopped.
                                     Jiluan River River Affairs Bureau, Hebei Province
                                             February 9th
    Editor's Note: It is hoped that the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and relevant agencies will immediately inspect and improve the Jiluan River defenses.

　　河北省水利局及有关机关应检查蓟滦河防
    编辑同志：
    一月十八日贵报“读者来信”栏发表任杰同志（本局秘书）关于“蓟滦河系河防屡遭破坏”稿件中所反映的情况，是本河系存在的实际情况。但是我们是技术机关，主要工作是技术指导方面，而行政责任则应属河北省水利局及当地各专署和县人民政府。这些屡遭破坏的情况，已经我们随时呈报河北省水利局，并致函各有关机关，但迄目前为止，这些非法的破坏行为，并未获得有效的制止。
                                     河北省蓟滦河河务局
                                             二月九日
    编者按：望河北省水利局及有关机关即检查并改进蓟滦河防。
