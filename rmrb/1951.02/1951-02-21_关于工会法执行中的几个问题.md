　　Several Questions Regarding the Implementation of the Trade Union Law
　　(1) Question: In the event of business losses, can the administrative side or the capitalists be exempted from or postpone the payment of trade union funds?
　　Answer: All public and private enterprises, regardless of their business situation, even if they encounter significant difficulties, cannot be exempted from or postpone the payment of trade union funds.
　　(2) Question: Should there be certain restrictions on the production time occupied by labor representatives for participating in labor-capital consultation and other activities?
　　Answer: Labor representatives participating in labor-capital consultation meetings and labor dispute mediation, the production time they occupy, in principle, may not be restricted by Article 18 of the Trade Union Law, because its nature is different from trade union activities.
　　(3) Question: Why must the administrative side or the capitalists obtain the consent of the trade union of the unit and the approval of the higher-level trade union for the transfer of trade union committee members' positions in production or administration?
　　Answer: The division of labor among the members of the trade union committee is based on the needs of the work and the individual's conditions, and also takes into account the positions held by the members in production or administration. Therefore, any transfer of his position in production or administration may affect his duties in the trade union, or even hinder trade union work. Therefore, when the administrative side or the capitalists have a transfer of trade union committee members' positions in production or administration, they must, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Trade Union Law, obtain the consent of the trade union committee of the unit and the approval of the higher-level trade union committee in advance.
　　(4) Question: Should employees who bear major responsibilities in production and business be elected as trade union committee members who are detached from production?
　　Answer: Regarding this question, it is first necessary to clarify a basic viewpoint, that is, trade union work and the interests of production and business are consistent, not opposed. Whether in state-owned, private, or cooperative enterprises, the trade union takes improving production as its own task. Therefore, when the grass-roots committee decides on members who are detached from production, in addition to the needs of trade union work, it is also necessary to take into account the impact on production and business. Conversely, in some enterprises, if an employee who bears major responsibilities in production and business is elected as a trade union committee member who is detached from production, the development of trade union work may bring greater benefits to production and business. Therefore, the right of trade union members to elect and be elected should not be restricted due to their positions in production and business, but only appropriate consideration should be given when assigning trade union work.

　　关于工会法执行中的几个问题
    （一）问：在营业亏损情况下，行政方面或资方是否可以免交或缓交工会经费？
    答：所有公私企业，无论营业情况如何，即令遇有重大困难，亦不能免交或缓交工会经费。
    （二）问：劳方代表因参加有关劳资协商等活动，其所占用之生产时间，是否需受到一定的限制？
    答：参加劳资协商会议及劳资争议调处的劳方代表，其占用生产时间，原则上可不受工会法十八条之限制，因其性质与工会活动不同。
    （三）问：为什么行政方面或资方对于工会委员在生产或行政上职务的调动，必须取得本单位工会的同意和上级工会的批准？
    答：工会委员会内各委员职务的分工，一方面是根据工作的需要和个人的条件；另一方面也照顾到各委员在生产或行政上所任的职务。所以他在生产或行政上的职务一有调动，就可能对他在工会中所负的职务发生影响，甚至妨碍工会工作。因此，行政方面或资方对于工会委员在生产或行政上的职务有调动时，必须依照工会法第十一条的规定，事先取得本单位工会委员会的同意和上级工会委员会的批准。
    （四）问：在生产营业上负重大责任的职工，应否被选为脱离生产的工会委员？
    答：对此问题，首先需要明确一个基本观点，即工会工作与生产营业上的利益是一致的，而不是对立的。无论在国营、私营或合作社经营的工厂企业中，工会都是以搞好生产为自己的任务，所以基层委员会在决定脱离生产的委员时，除根据工会工作的需要外，同时必需照顾到对于生产营业上的影响。反之，在某些企业中，一个在生产营业上负有重大责任的职工，被选为脱离生产的工会委员，由于工会工作的展开，对于生产营业可能有更大的利益。所以工会会员选举权和被选举权，不应因其在生产营业上所负的职务而受到限制，只能在分配工会工作时予以适当的照顾。
