Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The peasants of North China, who reaped a bumper harvest last year, are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the joyful Spring Festival. The scene of peasants in various places vying to buy New Year goods is unprecedented in more than a decade. Although the supply and marketing cooperatives in many villages in Hebei Province prepared a large number of New Year goods very early, they still could not meet the needs of their members. Many private merchants in Zhangjiakou City brought New Year goods to the countryside, and each time they were surrounded by villagers who bought up all kinds of goods. In Neihuang County, Pingyuan Province, more than 4.5 million catties of red dates were sold within a month, and 10,000 catties of daylilies were sold in Anyang County within a month. Farmers in various places also bought large quantities of cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, scallions, ginger, and other seasonings, preparing for a good New Year feast. Henanyuan Village in Lin County, Pingyuan, which is a major ginger-producing area, has been very lively for more than 20 days, with farmers from surrounding villages going to buy ginger. Many farm households in Chahar Province have whitewashed their houses and installed glass in their windows in preparation for the Spring Festival. Many households in the formerly impoverished Xiajiaying Village in Shanyin have replaced their old, rotten mats with new mats and new cotton batting this year. Many peasants voluntarily tore off the images of the God of Wealth and the Kitchen God that were originally enshrined in their houses and replaced them with New Year pictures and portraits of Chairman Mao. Mongolian herdsmen living far away in the grasslands also bought portraits of Chairman Mao and hung them in their houses or yurts.
	In order to meet the farmers' demand for "a good harvest year," state-owned trade departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places mostly started selling Spring Festival supplies in advance. The State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Department Store in Chahar Province have already sold more than 30 kinds of Spring Festival supplies worth more than 1 billion yuan in rural areas. The State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Department Store in Shanxi Province recently allocated materials to rural areas, exceeding one-half of the province's daily consumption. The Provincial Cooperative also sold a large number of New Year goods and more than 11,000 bolts of floral cloth. Farmers and herdsmen in Ulanqab League and Ik Zhao League in Suiyuan Province have bought a lot of white wine, boots, hada (silk scarves used for decoration and gifts), tea, sugar, etc. that they like this year. In addition, a large number of private merchants in Zhangjiakou, Datong, Xuanhua and other cities brought Hunan sugar, Anhui tea, western Hebei dates and Shanghai floral cloth to the countryside, all of which were warmly welcomed by farmers in various places.
	In addition to rushing to buy New Year goods, peasants in various places are also busy preparing for Spring Festival entertainment activities. Most of the more than 2,000 rural theater troupes in the Dingxian Special District of Hebei Province have prepared programs for the Spring Festival. They not only sing about the achievements of production and construction in the past year and the great victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but also praise Chairman Mao and thank the Communist Party and the People's Government for their leadership in various ways, which has enabled them to stand up and be happy.

　　华北农民争相购买年货
    热烈准备欢度春节
    【新华社三日讯】去年得到丰收的华北农民，热烈地准备欢庆快乐的春节。各地农民争相购买年货的盛况乃是十多年来所没有的。河北省许多村供销合作社虽然很早就筹办了大批年货，仍然不能满足社员的需要。张家口市很多私商办了年货下乡，每次都被村民包围起来，将各色货品购买一空。平原省内黄县的红枣，一个月内即卖出四百五十多万斤，安阳县的黄花菜也在一个月内卖出一万斤。各地农民更大量买进油、盐、酱、醋、葱、姜等调味品，准备过年吃。平原林县一个盛产姜的河南园村，二十多天以来热闹非常，四周村子的农民都去买姜。察哈尔省的许多农户把住房粉刷一新，窗子也装上了玻璃，准备过春节。向来贫困的山阴夏家营村的许多农户，今年都已将炕上多年的烂席片换上了新席子和新棉絮。许多农民自动将原来屋内所供的财神、灶王菩萨像撕下，换上了新年画和毛主席像。远居草原地带的蒙族牧民也都买回了毛主席像，挂在屋内或蒙古包内。
    各地的国营贸易部门和供销合作社为了满足农民“过好丰收年”的要求，大多提前出售春节用品。察哈尔省国营花纱布公司和百货公司已在农村售出了价值十多亿元的三十多种春节用品。山西省国营花纱布公司和百货公司最近拨运各地农村的物资超过全省日常用量的二分之一。该省合作总社亦售出大批年货和花布一万一千多匹。绥远省的乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟等地的农牧民今年买到了很多他们所喜爱的白酒、靴子、哈达（装饰和送礼用的绸绢）、茶和糖等。此外，张家口、大同、宣化等城市还有大批私商办了湖南的糖、安徽的茶、冀西的枣和上海的花布等下乡，都受到各地农民的热烈欢迎。
    除了赶办年货以外，各地农民还忙着准备春节的文娱活动。河北省定县专区两千多个农村剧团大部都准备好了春节上演的节目。他们不仅演唱一年来生产建设的成就和抗美援朝的伟大胜利，更采用各种方式歌颂毛主席，感谢共产党和人民政府的领导，使他们得到了翻身和幸福。
