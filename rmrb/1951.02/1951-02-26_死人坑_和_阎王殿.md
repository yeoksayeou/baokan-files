"Pit of the Dead" and "Hall of the King of Hell"
    Zhu Bo
The people in the northern suburbs of Beijing all mention the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek's running dog, Li Yongming, with gnashing teeth. This bloodthirsty bandit received his deserved and shameful end on February 18th in Qinghe Town – he was executed in front of over seven thousand victims.

    About a hundred steps east of Qinghe Town in the northern suburbs of Beijing, there is a place called "Longgang." This is an uneven wasteland overgrown with weeds. Tombs are piled everywhere, and white bones are scattered around, creating an atmosphere of infinite gloom. In the past, no one dared to come here; those who came here were either murderous traitors and secret agents or innocent people who were murdered. Here, there were often groups of wild dogs, barking wildly, fighting over the corpses of the dead. The smell of rotting corpses would penetrate people's nostrils from afar. The name "Longgang" was renamed "Pit of the Dead" by the masses six or seven years ago. This well-known "Pit of the Dead" was created single-handedly by the traitor and secret agent Li Yongming. Li Yongming killed at least seventy innocent people in the "Pit of the Dead."

    In the northern suburbs of Beijing, no one doesn't hate Li Yongming, the running dog of the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek. This bloodthirsty robber was a native of Yongtai Village in Qinghe Town and was thirty-two years old this year. Before 1943, he was a gangster; in 1944, he betrayed the motherland and joined the Japanese, serving as the captain of the Japanese secret service; after the "August 15th" Japanese surrender, he transformed himself again, becoming a secret agent directly under Liu Yulin, the commissioner of the Tongxian Special District of the Kuomintang; after the liberation of Beijing, he sneaked into the Beijing Municipal Disciplinary Corps, attempting to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, but was discovered and arrested by our public security organs.

    Li Yongming killed the most people in the "Pit of the Dead"; the second most were in the Zhang Family Courtyard and Xu Huchen's courtyard (the base of the secret service) in Qinghe Town. The local people called Li Yongming the "Living King of Hell" and the Zhang Family Courtyard the "Hall of the King of Hell," where more than thirty people were killed by Li Yongming.

    Li Yongming had three murder weapons: two Mauser pistols and a broadsword. Every time Li Yongming came out, he carried two Mauser pistols and a gleaming broadsword in his hand. However, Li Yongming used an iron shovel to kill the most people, so the nearby masses also called Li Yongming the "Iron Shovel Captain." In November 1944, Li Yongming arrested Gao Daohong and two others from the Supply Department of the Eighth Route Army's Pingbei Tenth Regiment, and on December 30th of the same year, he killed them all with iron shovels in the "Pit of the Dead." A few days before killing Comrade Gao Daohong, a cloth vendor from a neighboring village came to Qinghe Town. Li Yongming took a fancy to his bicycle and insisted that he was "secretly communicating with the Eighth Route Army." The next day, he dragged the cloth vendor to the "Pit of the Dead" and killed him with a shovel. Because Li Yongming used too much force, the wooden handle of the iron shovel broke, and the iron shovel was embedded in the dead man's head. Li Yongming stepped on the dead man's head to pull the iron shovel out. Too many people died so tragically at the hands of Li Yongming. Wei Gengshun, an old man who was forced by Li Yongming to bury the dead bodies at the time, said, "I saw forty or fifty people in the Pit of the Dead alone. He (referring to the bandit Li) forced others to bury the dead bodies, and they assassinated people at night, so I don't know how many there were."

    Li Yongming used the power of the Japanese to wantonly massacre innocent people. The local residents were in danger of being killed by Li Yongming at any time. Once, Li Yongming took a fancy to the bicycles of several salt merchants in Qinglongqiao, so he led several secret agents to wait in Qinglongqiao several times. Finally, he arrested five salt vendors, including Ma Deliang and Wang Kexing, and seized four bicycles and more than a thousand catties of salt that had just been transported. The five salt vendors were killed with iron shovels in the "Pit of the Dead" three days later. The families of the victims were ruined and their families were destroyed as a result. Ma Deliang's wife had no means of livelihood and remarried, and his children spent their days begging on the streets with their grandmother.

    When the masses in Qinghe Town and the surrounding areas saw Li Yongming, they had to call him "Master Li" and show a smiling face, otherwise, there would be trouble. In the spring of 1945, in Zhang Zhishan's sesame seed cake shop in Qinghe Town, two passers-by lost their lives because they didn't recognize Li Yongming and didn't stand up to call him "Master Li."

    Li Yongming raped many women in this area. Women in the villages near Qinghe Town could not escape his clutches as long as Li Yongming took a fancy to them. A young girl in Beiqijia Village, who was less than seventeen years old, was raped by Li Yongming and then taken back to the secret service headquarters, where she was gang-raped to death by the secret agents.

    February 18th was the day when the people of the northern suburbs demanded repayment of blood debts from Li Yongming. Early this morning, representatives of the masses from various villages near Qinghe and relatives of the victims rushed to witness the ugly end of this murderous robber. More than seven thousand people attended the meeting, including representatives of the masses from fifty-six administrative villages and the masses of Qinghe Town. When this robber, stained with the blood of the people, was escorted to the venue, it aroused the anger of all the people present. Ma Yushan, the elder brother of Ma Deliang, rushed up with a knife to cut off Li Yongming's ears. He cried and said, "You killed my brother, causing my family to be ruined and my family to be destroyed. You don't need to compensate the living, but you must find the corpse!" He was dissuaded and squatted aside crying bitterly. Wang Zhangshi from Qinglongqiao cried and said, "After my husband was killed by you, I was left with six orphans and widows. The oldest child is only fifteen years old. The whole family can't eat a full meal all day long, and even the four- or five-year-old children have to go out to pick coal cinders. Every time I see someone die, I think of my husband. You harmed me so much that I don't even have a grave to burn paper for. You have today!" As she spoke, she lunged at Li Yongming and was stopped by government personnel. The more than seven thousand people present unanimously demanded that the people's government impose the death penalty on Li Yongming. An old lady from Madian Village said, "I will be in pain every day Li Yongming doesn't die; the government will make the decision for us and execute him!" Old man Xu Lianxiang from Qinghe Town said, "If the government doesn't kill this lawless villain, there will be no justice." The workers of the Qinghe Woolen Mill unanimously demanded that Li Yongming be shot. They said, "This guy has harmed us so badly. As long as the government kills him, we will be happy to work overtime and produce."

    That afternoon, the bloodthirsty devil Li Yongming was executed in front of more than seven thousand people.

　　“死人坑”和“阎王殿”
    朱波
    北京北郊一带的人民，提起日寇、蒋匪的走狗李永明来，没有不切齿痛恨。这个杀人不眨眼的匪徒，二月十八日在清河镇得到了他应得的可耻下场——在七千余受害群众的面前被枪决了。
　　　　    
    从北京北郊清河镇东行百余步，有一个地方叫做“龙岗”。这是一片高低不平的长满野草的荒地。到处坟茔累累，白骨散乱，无限阴森。过去，没有人敢来这里，来这里的不是杀人的汉奸、特务，就是被杀害的善良人民。这里常有一群群的野狗，狂吠着，争啃死人的尸首。腐尸气味，很远就钻入人们的鼻孔。“龙岗”的名字，早在六、七年前，就被群众叫成“死人坑”。这个尽人皆知的“死人坑”，就是汉奸特务李永明一手制造的。李逆在死“人坑”杀害的善良人民，仅知道的就有七十多名。
    在北京北郊一带，提起日寇、蒋匪的走狗李永明来，没有一人不切齿痛恨的。这个杀人不眨眼的强盗，是清河镇永泰庄人，今年三十二岁。在一九四三年以前，他是个流氓；一九四四年背叛祖国投靠日寇，充任日寇的特务队长；“八、一五”日寇投降后，又摇身一变，成为国民党通县专区专员刘于林直接领导下的特务；北京解放后，混进我北京市纠察总队，企图借机进行反革命活动，为我公安机关发觉逮捕。
    李永明杀人最多的地方是在“死人坑”；其次是在清河镇的张家大院及徐虎臣的院子里（特务队的驻地）。当地人民都把李永明叫“活阎王”，叫张家大院为“阎王殿”，在这里被李逆永明杀害三十人以上。
    李永明有三个杀人武器：两支驳壳枪，一把砍刀。李逆每次出来，都是带着两支驳壳枪，手里拿着擦得雪亮的砍刀。但是，李逆用来杀人最多的还是铁锨，因此，附近的群众又称李逆为“铁锨队长”。一九四四年十一月，李逆逮捕了当时八路军平北第十团供给处的高道宏等三人，同年十二月三十日，全用铁锨砍死在“死人坑”。就在杀害高道宏同志的前几天，有一个外村的布贩来到了清河镇。李逆看中了他的自行车，就硬说他“私通八路军”，第二天，把卖布的拉到“死人坑”用锨砍死。因为李逆用力过猛，把铁锨木把都砍断了，铁锨嵌在死者的头上，李逆用脚蹬着死人的头，才把铁锨取下来。像这样惨死在李逆手里的人太多了。当时被李逆逼迫着埋死尸的魏耕顺老汉说：“在死人坑光我看见的就有四、五十人，他（指李匪）强迫别人埋的死尸和他们夜里暗杀的，那就不知道有多少人了。”
    李逆借日寇的势力就这样任意残杀无辜的人民。当地的居民，随时随地都有被李逆杀害的可能。有一次，李逆看上了青龙桥几个卖盐行商的自行车，便带领着几个特务在青龙桥等了数次，终于把盐贩马德良、王可兴等五人捉住，夺走了四辆自行车及刚运来的一千余斤盐。第三天五个卖盐的在“死人坑”被用铁锨砍死。受难者的家属因此而家破人亡。马德良的妻子生活无着，改嫁了，他的孩子，终日随着祖母沿街讨乞。
    清河镇一带的群众，看见李永明都必须称呼“李爷”，并要露出笑脸，否则就会出乱子。一九四五年春天，在清河镇张志善的烧饼铺里，有两个过路人，因为不认识李永明，没站起来叫“李爷”，就送了命。
    李逆在这一带强奸了很多妇女，清河镇附近村庄的妇女，只要被李逆看上，都脱不出他的魔爪。北齐家庄一个不满十七岁的小姑娘，遭李逆强奸后，又被带回特务队部，活活被特务们轮奸死了。
    二月十八日是北郊人民向李逆讨还血债的日子。这天早晨，清河附近各村的群众代表、受难者家属都赶了来，亲眼看着这个杀人强盗的丑恶下场。到会的有五十六个行政村的群众代表及清河镇群众，共七千多人。当这个沾满人民鲜血的强盗被押至会场时，激起了全体到会群众的愤怒。马德良的哥哥马玉山拿着一把刀子闯上去就要割李逆的耳朵，他边哭边说：“你杀了俺兄弟，弄得俺家破人亡，你不用赔活人，你把尸首给找出来吧！”他受到劝阻，恨得蹲在一边直哭。青龙桥王张氏哭着说：“俺丈夫被你打死后，剩下孤儿寡女六口，顶大的孩子才十五岁，全家成天吃不上一顿饱饭，连四、五岁的小孩都得出去拣煤渣。俺一看见别人家死人就想起俺先生，你蹧害得俺烧张纸都没有坟头，你也有今天！”说着就向李永明扑去，被政府人员劝住了。到会的七千多群众，都一致要求人民政府将李逆处以极刑。马店村一个老太太说：“李永明一天不死，我就痛苦一天；政府给我们做主，枪决他吧！”清河镇许连祥老汉说：“政府再不杀这个无法无天的坏蛋，就没有天理了。”清河制呢厂的工人们，一致要求枪毙李永明。他们说：“这家伙蹧害得我们太厉害了，只要政府杀了他，我们加班生产，心里也乐意。”
    当日下午，这个杀人不眨眼的魔鬼李永明，在七千多群众面前被枪决了。
