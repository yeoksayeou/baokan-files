Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th: “Women need peace, oppose war, demand that American aggressor troops withdraw from Korea, aid Korean women and children, and oppose American imperialism’s rearmament of West Germany and Japan.” This is the common call at the council meeting of the International Democratic Women’s Federation, which unites 91 million organized women worldwide. At this meeting, filled with an atmosphere of unity and consensus, women representatives from more than 30 countries pledged to unite half of humanity's women to participate in the struggle for peace, transforming every woman's hatred of war into a force for defending peace.

The women representatives from China and Korea, who are fighting to defend peace in the Far East and world peace, were warmly welcomed at the conference. On the 2nd, Chinese representative Lu Cui reported on the Chinese people’s movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. She pointed out that the great victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in arduous battles have severely struck at the aggressive plots of American imperialism and have once again proved that American aggressors can be completely defeated.

At the conference on the 3rd, Korean women's representative Xu Zhenshook delivered a speech stating: The atrocities and terrifying bombings of the American aggressors in Korea cannot destroy the patriotic will of the Korean people. Since the outbreak of the war, more than 344,000 Korean women have joined the People's Army, and many Korean women have joined the guerrillas. She thanked the Chinese people for their assistance on behalf of the Korean women and called on the women of the United States and Britain to demand the recall of their husbands and sons from the Korean battlefield. She concluded by suggesting that the International Democratic Women's Federation send a delegation to Korea to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. At the end of Xu Zhenshook's speech, the women representatives from China, Britain, and the United States stepped forward to give her the warmest kisses and hugs.

On the evening of the 6th, all the representatives of the council attended a grand evening party with 3,000 participants. The Chinese representatives conveyed the Chinese women's respect for the German women fighting for peace, democracy, and unity, and presented a silk banner to the German Democratic Women's Federation. The choir of the Free German Youth League sang the Chinese song "The East is Red," praising the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong, at the meeting.

    【新华社柏林七日电】“妇女需要和平，反对战争，要求美国侵略军撤出朝鲜，援助朝鲜妇女和儿童，反对美国帝国主义重新武装西德和日本。”这是团结着全世界九千一百万有组织的妇女的国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议上的共同的呼声。在这充满着团结和一致的气氛的会议上，来自三十多个国家的妇女代表们，都保证要团结占人类半数的妇女，参加争取和平的斗争，把每一个妇女对战争的憎恨化为保卫和平的力量。
    为保卫远东和平与世界和平而斗争的中朝两国的妇女代表受到大会的热烈欢迎。中国代表陆璀于二日在会上报告了中国人民所进行的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。她指出：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在艰苦的战斗中取得的伟大的胜利，已严重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，并再度证明美国侵略者是完全可以击败的。
    在三日的大会上，朝鲜妇女代表许贞淑发表演说称：美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行和恐怖的轰炸都不能摧毁朝鲜人民的爱国意志。自从战争爆发以来，已有三十四万四千余朝鲜妇女参加人民军，许许多多的朝鲜妇女参加了游击队。她代表朝鲜妇女感谢中国人民的援助，呼吁美英两国妇女要求召回她们在朝鲜战场的丈夫和儿子。她最后并建议国际民主妇联派遣代表团到朝鲜作实地的调查。许贞淑的演说结束时，中国、英国和美国的妇女代表都趋前给以最热烈的亲吻和拥抱。
