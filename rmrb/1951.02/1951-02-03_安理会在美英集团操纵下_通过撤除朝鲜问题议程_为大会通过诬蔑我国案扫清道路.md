　　Under the Manipulation of the US-British Bloc, the Security Council Passes Resolution to Remove the Korean Issue from the Agenda
    Clearing the Way for the General Assembly to Pass a Resolution Slandering Our Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] TASS, New York, 1st – At the proposal of the US-British bloc, the United Nations Security Council convened on January 31st, intending to remove the Korean issue from the agenda in order to clear the way for the General Assembly to pass a proposal slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor."
    British representative Jebb explained that Britain requested the meeting to take steps to counter any "technical" objections claiming that the General Assembly's handling of the Korean issue might infringe upon the authority of the Security Council. Jebb put forward the following proposal: "The Security Council resolves to remove the case of 'Complaint of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea' from the issues within the Security Council's jurisdiction."
    Soviet representative Zarapkin said that the so-called "Complaint of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea" was illegally included on the Security Council's agenda. He pointed out that the struggle between North Korea and South Korea is an internal conflict between two parts of the same nation, therefore the concept of aggression is not applicable. It is well known that the United States, under Truman's orders, carried out aggression by means of invasion. This heinous war is continuing, and as can be seen from the proposal passed by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, there are plans to continue this war.
    Zarapkin further said that it must be emphasized that all resolutions passed by the Security Council on this issue under pressure from the United States are illegal because they did not receive the consent of the Soviet Union and China, thereby violating the Charter. It must also be emphasized that the inclusion of the so-called "Chinese Intervention in Korea" case on the agenda of the Fifth General Assembly is also groundless, and its purpose is merely to cover up the aggression of the United States.
    The Security Council then passed the British proposal and adjourned.

　　安理会在美英集团操纵下
    通过撤除朝鲜问题议程       
    为大会通过诬蔑我国案扫清道路
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约一日讯：在美英集团的提议下，联合国安全理事会于一月三十一日开会，意图将朝鲜问题从议程上撤除，以便为大会通过侮蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的提案扫清道路。
    英国代表杰伯解释道，英国请求举行会议是为了采取步骤，对付任何声言大会处理朝鲜问题可能侵犯安全理事会权限的“技术方面”的反对意见。杰伯提出下列提案：“安全理事会决议由安全理事会权限内的问题中除去‘控诉对大韩民国侵略’案。”
    苏联代表查拉普金说，所谓“控诉对大韩民国侵略”案是非法列入安全理事会议程的。他指出，北朝鲜与南朝鲜之间的斗争是同一民族的两部分之间的内争，因此侵略的概念是不适用的。众所周知，是美国在杜鲁门命令下以进犯的方式而进行侵略的。这一罪恶战争正在继续，并且从联合国大会政治委员会所通过的提案中可以看出，还有计划继续进行这一战争。
    查拉普金又说，必须强调指出：安全理事会在美国压力下就这一问题所通过的一切决议都是非法的，因为它没有得到苏联与中国的同意，因而违反了宪章。也必须强调指出：把所谓“中华人民共和国干涉朝鲜”案列入五届大会议程也是毫无根据的，其目的只是为了掩饰美国的侵略。
    安全理事会随后即通过英国的提案，并宣布休会。
