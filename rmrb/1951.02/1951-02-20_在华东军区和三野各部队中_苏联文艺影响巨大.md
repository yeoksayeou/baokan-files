Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: Literature and art reflecting the great patriotism and revolutionary heroism of the Soviet people and the Soviet Red Army have exerted a tremendous influence in the East China Military Region and the various units of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. The Red Army Choir, the Soviet Youth Delegation, and the Soviet Sports Delegation, all of which were part of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' delegation that came to East China, left a deep impression on the commanders and fighters of the various units. In particular, the Red Army Choir's brilliant performances and the friendly matches between the Soviet Sports Delegation and the Third Field Army teams greatly inspired the troops in carrying out literary and artistic work and sports activities.

The commanders and fighters of the various units greatly love Soviet films and novels. The units have repeatedly screened Soviet films such as "An Ordinary Soldier," "Zoya," "The Battle of Stalingrad," "The Fall of Berlin," "The Young Guard," "A Real Man," and "Girl from the People." The commanders and fighters regarded watching movies as attending political lessons, and they often held discussions after watching them. They praised and extolled the story of the hero Matrosov in "An Ordinary Soldier," who bravely blocked the enemy's bunker, and many combat heroes and soldiers expressed that they must learn from the Soviet heroes' brave, tenacious, and fearless fighting style and their great revolutionary heroism. After watching films such as "The Battle of Stalingrad" and "The Fall of Berlin," the commanders and fighters of the various units enhanced their confidence and determination to fight to defend the motherland and world peace.

Famous Soviet novels such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Days and Nights," "Fear and Fearlessness," "A Real Man," and "The Young Guard" have become the most beloved reading materials for the commanders and fighters. Many people would rather discard clothing than these books during light marches. In hospitals, staff members often read novels such as "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "A Real Man" to the wounded soldiers. Many commanders and fighters who were wounded and disabled in combat were further strengthened in their fighting spirit by the inspiring deeds of Soviet heroes. One battalion commander said after reading "Days and Nights": "This book not only teaches us to fight bravely, but also gives me a deeper understanding of strategy and tactics." After reading "The Young Guard," many young intellectuals who had newly joined the army unanimously stated: If the imperialists dare to invade our great motherland, we will definitely fight the invaders like the Young Guard.

Soviet music and dance, such as "Volga Song," "March of the Motherland," "Army-Civilian Joint Celebration Dance," and "Red Army Dance," are also very popular in the troops. In particular, the dance art of the Soviet Red Army has brought new development to the troops' literary and artistic work in dance art. Now, the soldiers and members of the cultural troupes have created military dances that can reflect the reality of the struggle. In addition, the various units also frequently hold various photo exhibitions such as "Soviet Life," "Soviet Construction," and "Soviet Red Army" to enable the commanders and fighters to more deeply understand the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union.

　　在华东军区和三野各部队中
　  苏联文艺影响巨大
    【新华社南京十七日电】反映苏联人民和苏联红军伟大的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的文学艺术，在人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军各部队中发生了极大的影响。先后来华东的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团中的红军歌舞团、苏联青年代表团和苏联体育代表团，都给各部指战员留下极深刻的印象。特别是红军歌舞团的精彩表演、苏联体育代表团和第三野战军球队的友谊比赛，使部队在开展文艺工作和体育活动方面获得了很大的启发。
    各部的指战员们都非常热爱苏联的电影和小说。各部曾轮回放映《普通一兵》、《索亚传》、《斯大林格勒大血战》、《攻克柏林》、《青年近卫军》、《真正的人》、《人民之女》等苏联影片。指战员们把看电影当作上政治课，看完以后，常常举行漫谈。他们赞佩和传颂着《普通一兵》中英雄马特洛索夫挺身堵敌堡的故事，许多战斗英雄和战士都表示，一定要学习苏联英雄英勇顽强不怕牺牲的战斗作风和伟大的革命英雄主义精神。各部指战员们看了《斯大林格勒大血战》和《攻克柏林》等影片后，都增强了为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗的信心和决心。
    苏联著名的小说《钢铁是怎样炼成的》、《日日夜夜》、《恐惧与无畏》、《真正的人》、《青年近卫军》等作品，成为指战员们最喜爱的读物。许多人在轻装行军中，宁愿丢掉衣物，不愿丢弃这些书籍。在医院里，工作人员经常把《钢铁是怎样炼成的》、《真正的人》等小说读给伤员们听。许多在作战中负伤残废的指战员，在苏联英雄人物感人事迹的激励下，更加坚定了斗志。有一个营长看完了《日日夜夜》后说：“这本书不仅教育我们要英勇斗争，而且使我对战略战术有了更深的体会。”许多新参军的知识青年看完了《青年近卫军》后一致表示：如果帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们伟大的祖国，我们一定像青年近卫军那样与侵略者斗争。
    苏联的音乐和舞蹈，如《伏尔加歌》、《祖国进行曲》、《军民联欢舞》、《红军舞》等在部队中也很流行。特别是苏联红军的舞蹈艺术，使部队文艺工作在舞蹈艺术上得到新的发展。现在部队的战士和文工团员们，已创造出能够反映现实斗争的军人舞。此外，各部并经常举办《苏联生活》、《苏联建设》、《苏联红军》等各种照片展览会，使指战员们更深刻地认识苏联，向苏联学习。
