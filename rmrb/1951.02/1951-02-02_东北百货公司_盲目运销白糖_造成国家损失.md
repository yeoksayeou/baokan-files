    Northeast Department Store
    Blindly Transports and Sells White Sugar, Causing National Losses

To the Editor:

    Recently, the Northeast District Department Store used trains to transport a large quantity of sugar from Guangzhou to the Baoding Hebei Province Department Store. The dispatch of these goods was not approved by the superior company, nor was any contract concluded with the receiving company beforehand, resulting in the Hebei Province Department Store being unable to accept the sugar upon arrival. Later, the Hebei Province Department Store requested instructions from the China National Department Store Corporation, and the Corporation repeatedly instructed them to firmly refuse acceptance.

    The northbound transportation of sugar is currently a reversal of the flow of materials, because sugar imported from Qingdao can be transported and sold to areas south of Hankou. The existing sugar reserves in North China are also being prepared for dispatch to southern provinces, yet the Northeast District Department Store transported sugar imported from Guangzhou to Hebei Province without a plan or purpose. The loss of freight for this shipment, calculated based on a round trip of 1,500 kilometers (at a rate of 59,620 yuan per ton per 100 kilometers), is statistically over 155 million yuan. In addition, various damages en route and the capital tied up due to delayed sales will also result in a large loss. This kind of disorganized and undisciplined incident should attract serious attention. I suggest that the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the China National Department Store Corporation investigate this matter, and order the relevant dispatching cadres to conduct a thorough self-criticism, in order to educate cadres engaged in trade work in various places and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

### 东北百货公司  盲目运销白糖  造成国家损失

    东北百货公司
    盲目运销白糖  造成国家损失编辑同志：
    东北区百货公司近来用火车装载大量食糖从广州运往保定河北省百货公司。按该项物资的调运，并未经过上级公司批准，亦未与接受货物公司在先前订立任何合同即行运往，致食糖运达后，河北省百货公司无法接受。后来河北省百货公司请示中国百货总公司，总公司数次指示坚决拒收。
    食糖的北运在目前是物资倒流，因为从青岛入口的糖，是可以运销汉口以南地区。华北现有的存糖亦正准备向南方各省调运，而东北区百货公司却将广州入口的糖，无计划无目的的运到河北省来。这次损失的运费如按一千五百公里的往返路程计算（每吨每百公里计五九、六二○元），据统计即达一亿五千五百多万元。再加上沿途各种伤耗，耽误销货时间所造成资金积压，也是一个很大的损失。这种无组织无纪律的事件，应该引起严重的注意，我建议中央人民政府贸易部及中国百货总公司应追查此事，令有关之调运干部作深刻的检讨，用以教育各地做贸易工作的干部，并注意防止类似事件的再度发生。
