    [This News Report] The spokesperson for the China Zhi Gong Party, regarding Marshal Stalin's speech on February 16th, stated: Marshal Stalin used simple facts to expose all the deceptions of the war demons, and particularly regarding the United Nations' decision, manipulated by the United States, to recognize the People's Republic of China as an aggressor, he gave a definitive refutation, calling it a "shameful decision" and "utterly devoid of conscience." The spokesperson said: "We express our warm support for Stalin's speech, and we are especially grateful for his support of our country's justice. The Chinese people are determined to respond to Stalin's call and defend peace to the end; and we absolutely believe that all the actions of the warmongers will eventually be crushed under the iron fists of the people of the world."

　　中国致公党发表意见  响应斯大林和平号召
    【本报讯】中国致公党发言人对斯大林大元帅二月十六日的谈话发表意见称：斯大林大元帅以很简单的事实揭穿战争妖魔们的一切欺骗，并特别对于联合国在美国操纵之下所作的认中华人民共和国为侵略国的决定，给以斩钉截铁的反驳，称它为“可耻的决定”和“丧尽天良”。发言人说：“我们对斯大林的谈话，表示热烈拥护，而对于他支持我国的正义，尤觉感激无已。中国人民决心响应斯大林的号召，保卫和平到底；并绝对相信战争贩子们的一切行为，终会在全世界人民铁拳之下粉碎。
