　　Northwest Organizes Exchange of Local Products, Achieving Results
　　Living Standards of Herdsmen in Xinjiang's Ashan Region Initially Improved
    【Xinhua News Agency News】The Northwest District State-owned Trading Company achieved great success in organizing the exchange of local products last year. According to statistics: in the past year, through direct purchases by various specialized companies and the organization of cooperatives and private merchants to purchase and transport, a total of more than 23 million catties of wool were acquired, accounting for more than 62 percent of the region's annual output, along with 800,000 animal hides, and large quantities of cotton, casings, bristles, medicinal materials, mountain products, homespun cloth, salt, alkali, cooking oil, etc. More than 100,000 tons of materials were transferred throughout the region in one year, including more than 71,500 tons transported to other regions, more than 11,200 tons transported from other regions, and more than 22,000 tons allocated within the region. The above items have basically completed the planned targets.
    The Northwest region produces about 500 kinds of local products, and the income from farmers' and herdsmen's various local products and sideline occupations accounts for about 60 to 70 percent of the total agricultural income. In the past year, state-owned trading companies have vigorously purchased local products, turning materials that had been abandoned on the ground for many years into the people's wealth. For example, as a result of state-owned trading companies purchasing furs and medicinal materials in Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang and other provinces, the price of wool in various places has increased tenfold in one year. As farmers and herdsmen in these areas have found markets for their local products and their purchasing power has increased, cities and towns have experienced unprecedented prosperity. For example, the number of shops in Dingyuan Camp, the center of the Mongolian banner in Ningxia Province, has quadrupled in one year, and the population has increased from 7,000 to 10,000. In Huangyuan, the main distribution center for furs in Qinghai Province, the number of "Mongolian-Tibetan firms" dealing in necessities for Mongolian and Tibetan people has increased from 27 to 115.
    The Northwest Regional Trade Conference, held in late January, focused on discussing the issue of local product exchange. According to the policy of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the conference decided to strengthen the management of local products this year and expand domestic sales. State-owned trading companies at all levels should list the management of local products as a central task. In the management of local products, we should earnestly study the production and sales situation and overcome some of the blindness that existed in the procurement in the past year.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th】Since the State-owned Trading Company started its work in the Ashan Special District (Altai Mountain area) in Xinjiang Province, the living standards of herdsmen have been initially improved. The Ashan District is located on the extreme northern border of Xinjiang and is a region where the Kazakh people live. In the past, the livestock and furs produced in the area were mostly bought by merchants at depressed prices, and the herdsmen lived a very hard life, their clothes all made of plain old sheepskin. Since June of last year, state-owned trading companies have successively established four branch companies in the district and sent trade work teams, carrying daily necessities, to conduct material exchanges in the herdsmen's tribes. In the second half of last year alone, they purchased 7,000 gray squirrel skins and 15 tons of camel hair, so that all the local products that the herdsmen could sell last year, except for cattle, have been sold. The state-owned trading company also appropriately increased the price of local products during the purchase. For example, the price of 100 catties of wool was increased from the equivalent of one brick of tea in the past to three and a half bricks, and the price of 100 sheepskins was increased from the equivalent of eight bricks of tea to twenty-four bricks. As a result, the purchasing power of the herdsmen has greatly increased. Although more than 900,000 feet of cloth and 50 tons of sugar were imported in the autumn and winter seasons of last year, the population of the entire region is less than 60,000, and these still cannot meet the needs of the herdsmen.

　　西北组织土产交流获得成绩
　  新疆阿山专区牧民生活已初步改善
    【新华社讯】西北区国营贸易公司去年组织土产交流有很大成绩，据统计：一年来经过各专业公司直接收购和组织合作社、私商代购贩运的土产，计有毛绒二千三百多万斤，占全区年产量的百分之六十二强，兽皮八十万张，此外还有大量的棉花、肠衣、猪鬃、药材、山货、土布、食盐、石碱、食油等。全区一年内调运物资十万吨以上，其中运往外区的有七万一千五百多吨，由外区运入一万一千二百多吨，区内调拨二万二千多吨。上述各项基本上都完成了预定计划。
    西北地区所出土产约有五百多种，农、牧民各种土产及副业收入约占农业总收入的百分之六十到七十。一年来国营贸易公司大力收购土产，已使多年来货弃于地的物资变为人民的财富。如国营贸易公司在青海、甘肃、宁夏、新疆等省收购皮毛、药材的结果，各地羊毛价格一年内已提高十倍。这些地区农、牧民的土产有了销路，购买力提高，因而城、镇也就呈现了从来没有的繁荣。如宁夏省蒙旗中心定远营商店一年内便增加了四倍，人口由七千增到一万。青海省皮毛主要集散地的湟源，经营蒙民和藏民必需品的“蒙藏行”由二十七家增加到一百一十五家。
    一月下旬召开的西北全区贸易会议，曾着重讨论了土产交流问题。会议根据中央人民政府贸易部的方针，已决定今年加强土产经营，扩大内销，各级国营贸易公司应将经营土产列为中心任务。在土产经营中，应切实研究产销情况，克服一年来收购中存在的某些盲目性。
    【新华社西安十四日电】新疆省牧畜区阿山专区（阿尔泰山地区）在国营贸易公司开展工作以来，牧民生活已初步改善。阿山区地处新疆极北国境线上，是哈萨克族聚居地区。该区所产牲畜和皮毛，在过去多被商人抑价买去，牧民生活很苦，衣裤都是光板老羊皮。去年六月起，国营贸易公司在该区陆续设立分支公司四处，并派出贸易工作小组，携带日用必需品，深入牧民部落进行物资交换。只去年下半年内就收购灰鼠皮七千张，驼毛十五吨，使得去年该地牧民所可推销的土产，除牛只外都已售出。国营贸易公司在收购中并适当提高了土产价格，如每百斤羊毛由过去折值茶砖一块提高到三块半，羊皮由每百张折合茶砖八块提高到二十四块。因此牧民购买力已大为提高。全区人口不足六万，去年秋冬两季虽然输入布匹九十多万市尺，食糖五十吨，但仍不能满足牧民需要。
