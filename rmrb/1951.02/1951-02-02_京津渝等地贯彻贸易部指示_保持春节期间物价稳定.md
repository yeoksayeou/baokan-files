Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing and Other Places Implement Ministry of Trade's Instructions
Maintain Price Stability During the Spring Festival

[This newspaper's report] The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade's instructions regarding maintaining price stability during the Spring Festival have been supported by the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing. Beijing's public and private commercial enterprises and cooperatives have prepared a large amount of New Year's goods to ensure sufficient supply for all sectors of the capital during the Spring Festival.

The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee has also issued a call to all members, requesting them to maintain price stability during the Spring Festival, and requiring industries particularly related to the Spring Festival, such as grain, meat, vegetables, sugar, oil, and local products, to immediately take measures to promote trade between urban and rural areas and prevent price gouging.

In order to ensure price stability and timely supply during the Spring Festival, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce called on state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and related private businesses to purchase New Year's goods from various places before the New Year. Currently, in terms of state-owned trade, the Grain and Cotton Yarn companies have prepared a large amount of rice, flour, and colored cloth. The department store, with a special appropriation of 3 billion yuan from higher-level companies, has sent personnel to Shanghai and Tianjin to purchase food, canned goods, knitwear, and toys. The Native Produce Company has sent personnel to Yantai, Shenyang, Hankou, and other places to purchase a large number of Sichuan pickled mustard, kelp, Shantou tangerines, and bamboo chopsticks. The Trust Company has transported 700 pigs from the Northeast and plans to purchase and transport another 1,700. In addition to allocating a large amount of rice, flour, sugar, salt, alkali, oil, and cloth from state-owned trading companies according to the rationing regulations, the cooperative has also prepared a large amount of rice, pork, mutton, matches, and bowls. In addition, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce organized more than 50 groups from 11 industries, including local products and food, pig soup pots, cattle and sheep, and fisheries, and loaned 5.85 billion yuan to purchase a large number of apples, oranges, dates, seafood, canned goods, spices, and fish from the Northeast, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places.

[This newspaper's report] According to Xinhua News Agency: Tianjin City has decided to fully supply goods during the Spring Festival, resolutely implement the instructions of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade to maintain price stability during the Spring Festival, and not to increase the price of goods. The Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting of the directors of 125 industry associations in the city on the 27th. The directors of each industry association who attended the meeting spoke one after another to guarantee that prices would not rise before and after the Spring Festival. Among them, the bathhouse industry, which had previously increased prices more during the Spring Festival, guaranteed that the price of the entire industry would not exceed the price on January 15 before and after the Spring Festival. The director of the pork industry association reported that each group in the industry had formulated group covenants to ensure that the quantity of goods sold was sufficient, the supply was sufficient, and the gross profit was reduced from the usual 20% to 15%. Other industry association directors, such as department stores, rice and flour, candy, shoes and hats, melons and vegetables, and ash coal and gravel, also stated at the meeting that they would reduce the price of goods and supply them in large quantities during the Spring Festival. All attendees solemnly signed the "Support the Ministry of Trade's Instructions, Guarantee Price Stability During the Spring Festival" signature book on the spot to show their determination.

[This newspaper's report] According to Xinhua News Agency: Chongqing's state-owned trading companies and private industrial and commercial enterprises have adopted various effective measures to stabilize prices during the Spring Festival in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade. The wholesale business of state-owned trading companies has decided to only take holidays starting from Lunar New Year's Eve. If necessary, they will only rest for one day on the first day of the Lunar New Year and will open for business on the second day. The state-owned Chongqing Retail Company has decided to operate as usual during the Spring Festival, and its retail stores have been acting as agents for state-owned trading companies to sell sugar, vegetable oil, kerosene, ham, fungus, cotton cloth, and other items since January 22.

Chongqing's industrialists and businessmen have decided to conscientiously implement the patriotic covenant and guarantee that prices will not rise during the Spring Festival. Under the leadership of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, larger industries such as department stores, silk fabrics, food, and stationery are now generally implementing "clearly marked prices." In order to achieve small profits but quick turnover, salt merchants voluntarily reduced the price of each hundred jin of edible salt by 2,000 yuan. The barber industry, which always raises prices during the Spring Festival, also guarantees that the original price will not change and decides to extend working hours before and after the Spring Festival to meet the needs of employers. Some merchants in the paper industry attempted to raise prices in the market on January 23. After the industry association discovered this, they immediately reported it to the relevant government departments and jointly dumped goods in the market in large quantities, keeping paper prices stable. The stationery industry also convened a meeting of industry members to review the implementation of the patriotic covenant and criticized the few members who had not seriously implemented the patriotic covenant. The Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee convened a representative conference of various industries on the 26th to discuss the issue of stabilizing prices during the Spring Festival, attended by more than 110 representatives from more than 80 industries. At the meeting, the representatives expressed their determination to implement the patriotic covenant and guarantee price stability during the Spring Festival.
