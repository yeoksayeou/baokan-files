　　People in Five Major Cities Including Nanjing March and Demonstrate
　  Firmly Opposing the United States Rearming Japan
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in five major cities, including Nanjing and Guangzhou, have held demonstrations and marches, resolutely opposing the U.S. imperialist rearming of Japan.
    In Nanjing, more than 67,000 workers held a demonstration march on the 11th to oppose the United States rearming Japan. After Nanjing was captured by the Japanese invaders in 1937, 300,000 people were massacred. Therefore, the people of Nanjing are extremely indignant at the American plot to arm Japan. Railway workers, military industry workers, maritime workers, and educators in the marching队伍 (duìwǔ, ranks) held high models of locomotives, airplanes, cannons, anchors, and other products. Workers from some units also held high production tools and charts of their 1950 production achievements, demonstrating their strength. The marching ranks were welcomed by citizens along the way, who offered flags and flowers.
    In Guangzhou, 100,000 workers demonstrated and marched on the 11th to oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to rearm Japan. Before the march, the workers held a meeting and passed a letter to the Japanese workers, supporting the Japanese workers' struggle against the United States rearming Japan to be cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism. The Guangzhou workers' march was led by more than 700 worker pickets armed with machine guns, carbines, and rifles, accompanied by dozens of waist drum teams and lion dance teams.
    In Shenyang, 110,000 people from industrial, cultural, women's, business, religious, and other circles held demonstrations and marches during the Spring Festival to oppose the United States rearming Japan and to protest against U.S. imperialist slanders against our country. On the morning of the 5th, more than 40,000 workers from more than 20 industrial systems gathered in the City Government Square. Zhang Like, chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, called on all employees in the city to further carry out patriotic production competitions, fully support national defense construction, and completely smash the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism in order to defend peace in Asia and the world. A demonstration march was held after the meeting. More than 20,000 cultural and educational workers and young students in the city held a demonstration march on the 7th. Participants included 109 units from news, publishing, drama, film, libraries, museums, and universities and middle schools. Wherever the marching ranks went, citizens enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Oppose the United States Arming Japan." On the 9th, more than 20,000 women held a grand demonstration march. Guo Mingqiu, vice chairman of the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, female writer Cao Ming, and Korean women's representative Quan Zhenlie walked at the forefront of the ranks. Female workers from public and private enterprises throughout the city, female staff members of the troops, female cadres and female students from various agencies and schools, housewives, Catholic nuns, and Buddhist nuns all enthusiastically participated. A demonstration march of more than 20,000 people from the business community throughout the city was held on the 8th. The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and all directors and supervisors personally participated. They enthusiastically shouted slogans along the way. Scientists, religious figures, and ethnic minorities throughout the city held a demonstration march on the 10th. Among the scientists, there were more than 6,000 doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, most of whom wore red cross armbands. Taoists, monks, nuns from more than 60 temples throughout the city, and Christians from various parishes also participated in the march. The Imam of the Muslim Mosque and Mongolian lamas from Huang Temple, Xita, and other places also participated.
    In Harbin, 25,000 people from the business community, including 132 industries, held a patriotic parade and demonstration on the 10th to oppose U.S. imperialism rearming Japan and manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to pass proposals slandering our country. At the meeting, Liu Peizhi, chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Chen Jisheng, vice chairman, spoke successively. They unanimously stated in their speeches that the Harbin business community, which had suffered from Japanese rule and plunder, solemnly declared to the people of the country at today's demonstration and march: We are determined to express our firm opposition to U.S. imperialism rearming Japan and slandering our country with practical actions to further realize the patriotic convention and develop production. The meeting unanimously adopted a written statement opposing U.S. imperialism rearming Japan and slandering our country, and passed a message of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers. After the meeting, more than 25,000 people formed an orderly line and conducted a demonstration march.
    In Lanzhou, more than 5,000 people from eight ethnic groups, including the Hui, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Kazakh, Dongxiang, and Salar, gathered on the 11th of this month to pray for the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, and for the health of Chairman Mao. After the meeting, a patriotic demonstration march was held against the United States rearming Japan. Representatives from the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Gansu Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee, the Gansu Provincial and Lanzhou Municipal People's Governments, the Communist Party of China organizations, and various people's organizations participated. After the prayer, Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, was invited to speak. He called on people of all ethnic groups to unite more closely under the banner of patriotism and internationalism, actively carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, and completely smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to rearm Japan. Sun Zuobin, deputy secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wu Hongbin (Hui nationality), mayor of the Lanzhou Municipal People's Government, also spoke successively.
