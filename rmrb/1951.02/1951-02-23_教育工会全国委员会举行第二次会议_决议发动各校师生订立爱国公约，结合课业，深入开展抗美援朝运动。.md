    决议发动各校师生订立爱国公约，结合课业，深入开展抗美援朝运动。
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国教育工会全国委员会于二月十五日至十八日在京举行第二次会议。出席的有全国委员会委员及候补委员四十七人；列席的有经费审查委员及候补委员七人、工会工作干部十二人；模范教师陈仲孚亦应邀列席。
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章在会议开幕时指出：中国广大乡村的农民在解放后，生活一般地得到了改善，因此，他们迫切地要求他们的子女受教育。中国教育工作者有责任来满足他们这个要求。他强调地说明教育是国家很重要的建设事业，教育工会应该说服教育工作者把教育工作作为自己的终身事业；并设法帮助他们克服生活上的困难，使他们能安心地工作。他并号召教育工作者在贯彻反美爱国主义的思想教育的方针下，要把抗美援朝运动在各校中深入地展开。
    中央人民政府教育部部长马叙伦向会议报告了教育部一九五零年的工作总结和一九五一年的工作计划。
    中国教育工会全国委员会副主席刘子久在会议上报告了中国教育工会成立后半年来的工作总结和一九五一年的工作计划。他着重地指出：在各校中深入展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动是目前教育工会工作的首要任务。
    会议决定：根据各地区各学校不同的情况，发动各校师生订立爱国公约，作为自己爱国的行动纲领；把抗美援朝运动与日常课业结合起来，并要使抗美援朝的教育系统化和经常化。会议并就刘子久报告中的扩大与巩固教育工会的组织问题、怎样组织农村小学教师进行学习问题、教师工资福利等问题详加讨论，并作出了决议。
    会议认为，现在全国教育工会已有会员三十五万余人，应在一九五一年底发展到五十万人；并应巩固基层组织，使其对教师的生活福利及政治、文化、业务学习等方面能起一定的作用。
    会议认为，领导与组织教师学习是教育工会的重大任务之一，而如何组织广大农村教师进行学习是迫切需要解决的问题。会议决定推广察哈尔省蔚县的经验。这个经验是：组织业务通讯网，把分散在农村的教师组织起来，用互助的办法，解答业务上的问题；其次是组织业余学习班和开办流动图书馆。另外，会议决定选择三个县试办小学教师函授学校。
    关于改善教师的生活待遇问题，会议决定建议教育部应在可能的范围内作必要的改善；并推行“公办民助”或“民办公助”的办法，以保证乡村小学教师的生活；在已有工会组织的地方，发动会员成立互助会与合作社的组织，并根据各地区的条件尽可能地举办学校托儿所。
    会议最后通过致电中国人民志愿部队致敬，并致电世界和平理事会，表示坚决拥护第二届世界保卫和平大会的一切决议。
