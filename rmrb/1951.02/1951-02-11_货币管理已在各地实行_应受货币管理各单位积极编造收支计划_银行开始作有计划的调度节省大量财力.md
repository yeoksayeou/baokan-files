Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Currency Management Implementation Measures" and the "Currency Revenue and Expenditure Plan Preparation Measures," government agencies, state-owned enterprises, military units, organizations, cooperatives, and other entities across the country have actively prepared currency revenue and expenditure plans. According to statistics from the head office of the People's Bank of China, to date, over 90% of units nationwide subject to currency management have prepared revenue and expenditure plans, and 70% of the consolidated currency revenue and expenditure plans prepared by local branches of the People's Bank based on the plans of various units have been submitted to the head office. In many large cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu, all units completed revenue and expenditure plans in January. In Shanghai, 98% of municipal units and 94% of military units prepared and submitted revenue and expenditure plans in January. In Qingdao, over 95% of units also prepared and submitted revenue and expenditure plans in January.

After the initial implementation of planned revenue and expenditure by various units, the People's Bank has begun to allocate currency in a planned manner and use it rationally, saving the state a significant amount of financial resources. This is a step forward compared to the previous cash management period, which only involved cash returning to the bank.

During the promotion of currency management and preparation of revenue and expenditure plans in various regions, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government specifically arranged methods for preparing revenue and expenditure plans to their respective subordinate units. Financial and economic committees at all levels provided specific instructions, and responsible persons from many departments personally arranged the work. For example, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, personally resolved the issue of approving plans for subordinate departments. Many places also held training courses on currency management. People's Banks in various regions also proactively helped units improve their accounting systems and inspected their financial situations. These were the main reasons for the smooth initial progress of currency management.

Based on the current situation, the results of preparing revenue and expenditure plans and their initial implementation have played a significant role in avoiding waste and striving for the rational use of state financial resources. Firstly, because departments must carry out revenue and expenditure according to plans, the planning of each department's operations and production has been greatly strengthened. For example, trading companies in Shanghai now carry out procurement and sales according to plans, avoiding the chaotic phenomena of the past. At the same time, many production organizations must also carry out production strictly according to plans in order to complete their revenue and expenditure plans.

Secondly, because revenue and expenditure plans indicate the situation of material allocation and the scope of currency use, banks now have a basis for regulating the circulation of currency in the market. For example, the Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank can now generally grasp the currency revenue and expenditure patterns of major departments, and therefore proactively controls the volume of currency circulation in the market, preventing price fluctuations.

Thirdly, the past simple customer relationship between state banks and various units has been changed, making state banks and various units close partners in the entire economic construction.

The main problems currently existing in the preparation of revenue and expenditure plans are that many units' plans are not practical and lack accuracy. Many units still harbor departmentalism, fearing restrictions on their own cash turnover. Therefore, many of the revenue and expenditure plans they make show less revenue and more expenditure in the cash section, and more revenue and less expenditure in the transfer section. The head office of the People's Bank is now preparing to sign contracts with the central competent authorities regarding the implementation of revenue and expenditure plans and the centralized commercial credit, in order to make the various tasks of currency management more specific.

　　货币管理已在各地实行
    应受货币管理各单位积极编造收支计划        
    银行开始作有计划的调度节省大量财力
    【新华社十日讯】自中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会颁布了《货币管理实施办法》及《货币收支计划编制办法》后，全国各地的机关、国营企业、部队、团体、合作社等，都已积极编造货币收支计划。根据中国人民银行总行的统计，截至目前止，全国应受货币管理的单位已有百分之九十以上编造了收支计划，人民银行各地分行根据各单位的货币收支计划所编制的综合货币收支计划也已有百分之七十送达总行。许多大城市如北京、西安、兰州、重庆、成都各单位在一月份全部做了收支计划。上海市市属各单位一月份有百分之九十八编送了收支计划，部队单位有百分之九十四编造了计划。青岛各单位一月份也有百分之九十五以上编送了收支计划。
    各单位初步按照计划收支后，人民银行已开始将货币作有计划的调度和予以合理的使用，为国家节省了大量的财力，这比过去现金管理时期仅使现金归行又推进了一步。
    各地在推行货币管理工作编造收支计划时，中央人民政府铁道部、纺织工业部等都向所属具体布置了编造收支计划的办法，各级财经委员会都作了具体的指示，很多部门的负责人都亲自布置工作，如河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰亲自解决了所属部门批核计划的问题。许多地方还开办了货币管理工作的训练班。各地人民银行也都主动帮助各单位健全会计制度，并检查各单位的财务情况。这些都是促使货币管理工作的第一步顺利进行的主要原因。
    根据目前情况，各地编造收支计划和初步执行的结果，对避免浪费和力求国家财力的合理使用这两点上，已起了显著的作用。首先，因为各部门必须按照计划进行收付，就大大加强了各部门经营和生产的计划性。如上海各贸易公司现都已按照计划收购和销售，避免了过去收购或销售中的紊乱现象。同时，许多生产机构为了完成收支计划，也都必须很好地按照计划来进行生产。
    其次，因为收支计划表明了物资调拨的情况和货币使用的范围，银行在调剂市场货币的流通时开始有了依据。如人民银行山西省分行，目前大体上已能掌握各主要部门的货币收支规律，因此也就主动地掌握了市场货币的流通量，不使物价波动。
    第三是改变了过去国家银行与各单位之间单纯的主顾关系，使国家银行和各单位成为整个经济建设中密切合作的部分。
    目前在编造收支计划中存在的主要问题是很多单位所编造的计划不切实际，准确性还差，许多单位还存在着本位主义思想，害怕限制了自己现金的周转，因此所做的收支计划很多是现金部分收少支多，转账部分收多支少。现人民银行总行已准备与中央各主管部门签订关于执行收支计划和集中商业信用的合同，以便使货币管理的各项工作更具体化。
