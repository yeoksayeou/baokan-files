　　Sino-Soviet Friendship Guarantees World Peace

　　"A Year of Unprecedented Development of Sino-Soviet Friendship," edited by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, published by Shidai Publishing House, 25 format, 219 pages, basic price 13 yuan.
　　"A Year of Unprecedented Development of Sino-Soviet Friendship" was published to commemorate the first anniversary of the founding of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, covering the period from October 1949 to October 1950.
　　The book contains more than 40 articles, 14 of which are written by Soviet friends about Sino-Soviet relations. There are six articles in "Selected Essays", four of which describe the work of Soviet experts in China. (It is impossible to know from the original book what kind of "essay" this was, which is an editorial oversight.)
　　From the articles by Soviet friends collected in this book, we can see how Soviet friends valued the victory of the Chinese people. For example, Pravda wrote: "The victory of the Chinese people has immeasurably consolidated the international peace, democracy and socialism camp, given a devastating blow to the entire world imperialist system, and encouraged the people of colonies and dependent countries to fight for their freedom and national independence." "The events that took place in China last year are more important than those of the past few hundred or even thousands of years." Soviet Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Stoletov, said: "The victory of the Chinese people over the imperialists and domestic reactionaries is the greatest historical event. In terms of its significance, this victory is one of the greatest events of the 20th century. All freedom-loving people in the world are grateful to the organizers of these victories - the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong." "The victory of the Chinese people has opened the way to consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship. And this friendship is an unparalleled great and powerful force in human history to guarantee world peace." Soviet Doctor of Historical Sciences, Avalin, said: "In the camp of democratic forces, the Soviet Union's great ally in the struggle for peace and democracy is the People's Republic of China." "The united front between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a powerful and invincible force." Political commentator, Milov, quoted a sentence said by Comrade Molotov last year: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February made Sino-Soviet friendship a great and powerful force in the cause of consolidating world peace, a force that has no comparable force in human history, past and present."
　　The Soviet people are filled with comradely and joyful feelings about the historical victory of the Chinese people. Simonov said: "We Soviet people feel a kind of brotherly feeling." "I want to feel a brotherly joy for their achievements over the past year."
　　At this stage, the comradely assistance we Chinese people receive from the Soviet Union is truly enormous. This book happily collects a lot of rich and vivid materials, eloquently proving this to the readers.
　　Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Republic, Dubrovina, who participated in the Soviet cultural, artistic and scientific workers delegation to visit the people's China, said: "Like all comrades of the delegation, I am deeply convinced that the vitality of the liberated Chinese people hides unlimited power. They are victors and builders. I am deeply convinced of the genius, discipline, revolutionary nature, diligence, honesty, heroism and bravery of the great Chinese people."
　　The Soviet Union gave China significant international political support, spiritual and moral encouragement, and material transfusion, but more importantly, it selflessly shared the successful experience of socialist construction with the Chinese people. People cannot help but be excited and encouraged by this: the great experience that the Soviet people have explored with blood and sweat through 30 years of long historical twists and turns, the Chinese people have gained at the very beginning. Therefore, the Chinese people can shorten the historical journey and reduce many painful years. We only need to see how widely the Soviet construction experience has been used in the construction cause in the past year, and thus we can know that great victories have been won on all fronts.
　　The Soviet Union sent a large number of experts to help the Chinese people, who are full of fighting spirit, so that we have not only courage, but also wisdom. From the records of Soviet experts in this book, we only need to quote the following story to see a glimpse of it.
　　Bridge expert Shagrov was sent to China to help repair railway bridges. An article described his selfless internationalist spirit: "Whenever something has not been completely completed, he always tries to struggle with the last bit of strength. At work, due to overwork and poor diet, his radiant face finally became as thin and gray as if he had been confined in prison for a long time, and his eyes were sunken into their sockets. When our responsible comrades advised him to rest, he said seriously: 'While I can still support it, I am absolutely unwilling to rest in front of the Chinese people who are in difficulty - because this project is related to the greatest needs of the Chinese people. If it is not repaired for a day, it is equivalent to the people of southern China suffering one more day of disaster.'"
　　Shagrov also politically educated some of our more paralyzed comrades. He said: "Is it necessary to repair it quickly? If so, then we should do our best to complete it immediately. ... Difficulties cannot determine whether we repair it or not... but determine how we try to overcome it technically after we repair it. Therefore, technology is only a tool we use to achieve our goals." That is to say: technology must obey political tasks.
　　What attitude did Shagrov use to work? Was it putting on the airs of an "expert", with a face of "uniquely endowed" "benefactor", stomping his feet, cursing and whipping Chinese workers - like the ugly attitude that American imperialist colonists once performed in China? No. He "carried out the repair work tirelessly with us. In order to encourage everyone's working mood, he used his hard Chinese, regardless of fatigue, and shouted vigorously: 'Comrades! Is it good? Is it right? Is it okay?' That kind of cordial voice and appearance made us feel very moved."
　　What makes us even more moved is this: Soviet experts believe that their task is not simply to help us do the work well, but to enable us to learn how to do the work well. Shagrov said: "I must make Chinese comrades believe from the bottom of their hearts that this is correct, because my task is not only to complete this project on schedule, but also to make Chinese comrades who have worked with me understand these principles, so that when they encounter the same situation again, they can quickly and correctly grasp the manpower and material resources to deal with it."
　　"He cherishes the equipment like his own life. Whenever there is a slight waste phenomenon on the scene, he always regrets and says: 'This is a loss to the country! For the people, this is an unforgivable crime.' Similarly, he is absolutely unwilling to waste the manpower that can be saved in the slightest. He often said: 'Manpower is the most valuable thing. We must do our best to save manpower technically.' In particular, the safety of comrades is what he is concerned about. He has repeatedly suggested to our responsible comrades to make every cadre who directly leads the construction familiar with the on-site construction regulations. It is necessary to absolutely prevent accidents and casualties. He said: 'Working comrades have the care and care of their parents at home. At work, cadres must have the spirit of mutual assistance. Cadres who do not care for the health of comrades and care about the lives of comrades are not good cadres.'"
　　We can clearly see from these places: the imperialist policy towards China is to make China always a backward country that begs, depends on, and wastes people's strength and people's lives to the greatest extent. The Soviet policy towards China is to hope that China will grow into an independent, good at controlling its own work and career, and a progressive country that cherishes people's labor ability and happiness.
　　In these moving facts, no one can help but be moved by the selfless and pure feelings of the Chinese and Soviet people, and thus deeply understand the true meaning of internationalism. Therefore, this book is highly recommended to readers.

    《中苏友好空前发展的一年》，北京中苏友好协会编，时代社出版二五开本，二一九页，基价一三元
    《中苏友好空前发展的一年》是纪念北京中苏友好协会成立一周年而出版的，取材的时间是从一九四九年十月到一九五○年十月。
    本书收有文章四十余篇，其中有十四篇是苏联朋友所写的有关中苏友好关系的文字。有六篇“征文选刊”其中四篇是记述苏联专家在中国的工作情形的。（这是一次什么“征文”，从原书中竟无法知道，这是编辑上的一种疏忽。）
    从本书所收集的苏联朋友的文章中，可以看到苏联朋友是如何估价中国人民的胜利。例如真理报写道：“中国人民的胜利，无可限量地巩固了国际和平、民主与社会主义阵线，给了整个世界帝国主义体系一个毁灭性的打击，鼓舞了殖民地附属国人民去为自己的自由和民族独立而斗争。”“去年在中国发生的事变，其意义比过去几百年甚至几千年中的还更为重要。”苏联农业部副部长斯托列托夫说：“中国人民战胜了帝国主义者和国内反动派——这是最伟大的历史事件。在其意义上讲来，这个胜利是我们二十世纪最大的事件之一。世界上一切自由思想的人民都感谢这些胜利的组织者——中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东。”“中国人民的胜利打开了巩固并发展中苏友谊的道路。而这个友谊则是人类历史上无与伦比的伟大而强有力的保障全世界和平的力量。”苏联历史科学博士阿瓦林说：“在民主力量阵营里，苏联争取和平民主的斗争中的一个伟大盟国，就是中华人民共和国。”“苏联和中华人民共和国的统一战线，是一个强大而无敌的力量。”政治评论家米洛夫引述了莫洛托夫同志去年说的一句话：“在二月中签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，使中苏友谊在巩固全世界和平的事业上，变成为伟大而强大的力量，这一力量在人类历史上过去和现在都没有可以和它相比拟的。”
    苏联人民对中国人民的历史的胜利，是充满着同志的愉快的感情的。西蒙诺夫说：“我们苏联人民感受到一种兄弟的感情。”“我要为他们一年来的成就而感到兄弟般的喜悦。”
    在现阶段，我们中国人民所受苏联的同志的援助，真是非常巨大，这本书可喜地搜集了极多的和丰富生动的材料，向读者雄辩地作了证明。
    俄罗斯共和国教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜曾经参加访问中国的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团来到人民的中国，她说：“我和代表团所有团员同志们一样，深信解放了的中国人民的活力潜藏着无限的力量，他们是胜利者，也是建设者。我深切信服伟大中国人民的天才、纪律性、革命性、勤劳、诚实、英雄主义和勇敢。”
    苏联给与了中国重大的国际政治的支援，精神道义的鼓励，以及物质上的输血，但更重要的，是它无私地向中国人民和盘托出社会主义建设成功的经验。人们不能不为此而兴奋鼓舞：苏联人民经过三十年长久的历史的曲折，用血和汗摸索出来的伟大经验，中国人民在一开步走时，就把这些获得了。中国人民因此得以缩短历史的行程，减少许多痛苦的岁月。我们只要看在一年来的建设事业中，是如何广泛地采用着苏联建设的经验，因而在一切战线上都打了大胜仗就可以知道了。
    苏联派出了多量的专家来帮助富有战斗毅力的中国人民，使我们不但有勇，而且更有智慧。从本书中关于苏联专家们的记述中，我们只要引述下面的故事就可以见一斑。
    桥梁专家沙格洛夫被派来中国帮助修复铁道桥梁。有一篇文章这样描写着他忘我的国际主义精神：“每当一件事情还没有彻底完成的时候，他总是要尽最后一点力量挣扎的。在工作时，由于操劳过度和饮食的低劣，终于把他的一张红光焕发的面孔，变得像一个久困牢狱似的消瘦和灰暗了，两只眼睛也陷进了眼窝。当我们的负责同志劝他休息时，他却严肃地说：‘在我还能支持的时候，是决不愿意在困难中的中国人民面前休息的——因为这个工程，关系着中国人民最大的需要，它一天不修复，就等于南中国人民多受一天灾难。’”
    沙格洛夫又曾经在政治上教育了我们一些比较麻痹的同志，他说：“是否需要很快地修好它？如果需要，那么我们就应该尽所能的马上修成。……困难，不能决定我们修不修……而是决定修了之后，我们怎样设法从技术上去克服它，所以，技术只是我们用来达到目的的工具。”这就是说：技术必须服从政治任务。
    沙格洛夫是用什么态度来工作的呢？是摆着“专家”的架子、一脸孔“得天独厚”的“恩人”面貌、顿着脚咒骂着和鞭打着中国工人——象美帝国主义殖民者曾经在中国表演过的那副丑恶的气派么？不是的。他是“不辞疲劳地和我们一起进行了修复工作。为了鼓励大家的工作情绪，他不顾疲劳地用着生硬的中国话，用劲地喊着：‘同志们！好不好？对不对？行不行？’那种亲切的声音和样子，使得我们感动万分”。
    使我们更加感动的是这样一件事：苏联专家认为，他们的任务并不是单纯地帮助我们做好工作，而是要使我们学会做好工作。沙格洛夫说：“我必须使中国同志们从心里确信这样做是正确的，因为我的任务不仅是要按期修好这个工程，而且还要使与我一起工作过的中国同志都领会这些道理，好在再遇到和这相同的情形时，就能很快的、正确的紧握人力和物力来处理它。”
    “对于器材，他是像自己的生命一样来爱护的。每当现场稍有浪费现象的时候，他总惋惜地说：‘这是国家的损失！对于人民，这是一种不可饶恕的犯罪行为。’同样的，他也决不愿意让可能节省的人力有丝毫浪费。他常常这样说：‘人力是最可宝贵的东西，我们必须极尽所能的从技术上设法节省人力。’特别是同志们的安全，更是他所关切的，他曾不厌其烦地屡次建议我们负责同志，要每个直接领导施工的干部，熟悉现场施工规程。要绝对防止事故和伤亡。他说：‘工作同志在家有父母的关心和照顾，在工作中，干部就要有互助的精神，不爱护同志们的健康和关心同志们生活的干部，就不是好干部。’”
    我们可以从这些地方明显地看出来：帝国主义对于中国的政策，是要使中国永远是乞求者、依赖者和最大地糟蹋人的力量和人的生命的落后国家，苏联对中国的政策，则是希望中国长成为一个独立的、善于支配自己的工作和事业的、以及珍贵人民的劳动能力和幸福的前进的国家。
    在这些诸如此类的动人事实中，任何人都不能不为中苏人民的无私的、纯挚的感情而感动，从而深切了解到国际主义的真谛。因此，这本书是极值得向读者推荐的。
