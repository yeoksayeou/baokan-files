Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 14th Dispatch from Electronegative News Agency: U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins and Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg both admitted in their reports that the morale of the invading U.S. troops in Korea was low, and the puppet troops disobeyed the orders of the U.S. invading army authorities. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins, in his report to Secretary of Defense Marshall on his trip to the Korean front in January, described in detail the low morale of the invading U.S. troops in Korea. In his report, Collins cited several examples to illustrate how U.S. troops left their designated positions without receiving orders, thereby disrupting the deployment of entire sections of the front line. Collins claimed that defeatism was not only widespread among the officers and soldiers of the U.S. army on the front line, but also permeated some senior commanders. According to sources close to the U.S. Department of Defense, the recall of the commander of the 24th Infantry Division, Church, and the commander of the 7th Division, Barr, was the result of Collins' trip to the Far East. These two generals repeatedly advocated for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea, and in conversations with officers, they emphasized that continuing resistance was futile. In reports to the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee by U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg and Army Chief of Staff Collins, it was also mentioned that the morale of the "United Nations" forces (including U.S. troops) was very low, making it impossible for U.S. troops to achieve any major "victories" in Korea. In their reports on the military situation in Korea and the future prospects under the current troop deployment, they stated that due to the increasing guerrilla activities, losses at the front and in the rear have increased, and the replacement troops are insufficient.

Collins and Vandenberg both complained that the puppet troops did not support the U.S. military. They said: The Commonwealth countries have not sent additional personnel to Korea, and other countries may follow suit, some of which are even prepared to recall their troops from the Korean front. Collins also pointed out in his report to Marshall that British commanders disobeyed MacArthur's orders. Collins said that the commander-in-chief of the British Commonwealth forces in Korea, Robertson, explained this disobedience by saying that British officers are more experienced than American officers in solving tactical problems.

Collins and Vandenberg said: Withdrawing American troops now would be an undesirable approach, as it would further diminish America's already low prestige in Asia. Therefore, they suggested: Adopting a tactic of continuing resistance while withdrawing when it becomes inevitable, which can be explained as "due to the enemy's superior forces, it is unavoidable." They believe that this would provide a reason to publicly blame those countries that "failed to provide sufficient active support to make the United Nations' collective measures in Korea effective." They also placed a large part of the responsibility for the U.S. military's disastrous defeat in Korea on the U.S. intelligence agencies. They said that the Central Intelligence Agency failed to provide the necessary intelligence on the enemy's strength and objectives, and often led the United States to a dead end on Far Eastern issues.

### 美陆军参谋长柯林斯等供认  侵朝美军士气低落  附庸军队不听指挥

　　美陆军参谋长柯林斯等供认
    侵朝美军士气低落
    附庸军队不听指挥
    【新华社十四日讯】据电通社华盛顿十三日电，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯和空军参谋长范顿伯的报告中都招认了侵朝美军士气低落，附庸军队不听美侵略军当局的指挥。美国陆军参谋长柯林斯向国防部长马歇尔所作的他一月间在朝鲜前线的旅行报告中，详细地叙述了侵朝美军士气低落，柯林斯在他的报告中举出几个例子，说明美国部队未接到命令即离开指定阵地，因而使得整个阵线各段的部署混乱。柯林斯称，失败主义不但广泛地散布在美国军队前线官兵中间，并且遍及某些高级指挥官身上。据接近美国防部的人士透露，撤回第二十四步兵师师长邱奇和第七师师长巴大维就是柯林斯远东之行的结果。这两个将领一再主张美军立即从朝鲜撤退，在和军官们谈话时，他们曾强调继续进行抵抗是徒劳无益的。在美国空军参谋长范顿伯和陆军参谋长柯林斯告诉参院军委会小组委员会的报告里，也谈到“联合国”军队（包括美军在内）士气很低，使得美国部队不可能在朝鲜取得任何重大的“胜利”。他们报告朝鲜军事形势及在目前兵力配备情况下未来的前景称：由于游击队活动的增长，前线和在后方的损失都增加了，而且补充的军队是不够的。
    柯林斯和范顿伯都埋怨附庸军队不支持美军。他们说：英联邦国家没有派遣补充人员到朝鲜，其他国家也可能效尤，其中有些国家甚至已经准备从朝鲜前线召回它们的军队了。柯林斯在其致马歇尔的报告中亦指出，英国指挥官们不服从麦克阿瑟的命令。柯林斯说，朝鲜大英联邦军队总司令罗伯逊解释这种不听命令时称：英国军官在解决战术问题上比美国军官更有经验。
    柯林斯与范顿伯说：现在就撤退美国军队会是一种不可取的办法，因为这会使美国在亚洲已经很低的威信更加低落。所以他们建议：采取继续抵抗同时在再也不可避免的时候撤退的战术，可以解释作“由于敌军的优势兵力，不得不然”。他们认为，这样就有理由公开地归咎于那些“未能提供足够积极支持以使联合国在朝鲜的集体措施得以有效执行”的国家。他们还把美军在朝鲜惨败的很大部分责任推在美国情报机关上。他们说，中央情报局未能供给关于敌军实力和目标的必要情报，而且在远东问题上常常把美国引到穷途末路。
