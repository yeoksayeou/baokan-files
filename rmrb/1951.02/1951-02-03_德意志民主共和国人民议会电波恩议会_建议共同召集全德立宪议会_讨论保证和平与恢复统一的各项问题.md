Xinhua News Agency, 1st [day of the month]: According to TASS Berlin: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on January 30th and passed a joint cable to the Bonn Federal Parliament from all parties and groups in the People's Chamber regarding the suggestion of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to establish an All-German Constituent Assembly.

The cable declared: The purpose of the suggestion made by Premier Grotewohl in his letter of November 30, 1950, to Federal Chancellor Adenauer, regarding the commencement of negotiations for the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly, is to achieve mutual understanding among the German people themselves in order to maintain peace, restore German unity, and conclude a peace treaty. This suggestion has received the endorsement of the entire German people. However, Adenauer's statement on January 15th of this year, rejecting the proposal of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, proves that he is pursuing a policy of revanchism and militarism, leading the German people towards disaster.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, in accordance with the German people's desire for peace and unity, hereby suggests to the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany: to jointly convene an All-German Constituent Assembly in order to obtain agreement on all issues that must be resolved to guarantee peace and restore unity. The People's Chamber declares that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic attending the All-German Constituent Assembly will be authorized to specifically discuss:

	(1) Suggestions regarding the conditions for a unified Germany, particularly suggestions regarding the establishment of a legitimate national system mentioned in Adenauer's statement, a form of German government based on free principles, and suggestions regarding the protection of human rights and the maintenance of peace.

	(2) The issue of amending the "Law on the Defense of Peace" so that this law can be extended to the entire Germany.

	(3) At the earliest meeting of the All-German Constituent Assembly, negotiations on issues such as the number, armament, and stationing of police forces throughout Germany—including the People's Police of the German Democratic Republic—will be conducted. If necessary, the German Democratic Republic is even willing to reduce the number of police in eastern Germany, on the principle of mutual agreement, before Germany has restored unity. These principles must also be effective in West Germany.

	(4) In view of Adenauer's statement that the Federal Government will henceforth refrain from any military measures and devote itself to safeguarding German peace, the representatives of the German Democratic Republic will be authorized to issue a statement, together with the representatives of the Federal Republic, in the name of the entire German people, stipulating the prohibition of German re-militarization and the establishment of any German army, and taking necessary measures to ensure that the German administrative organs and the entire people supervise the implementation of this prohibition.

	(5) The issue of the conditions for holding free, universal, equal, secret, and direct elections throughout Germany. The suggestions of the Federal Government and the suggestions that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic may put forward will all be considered.

	(6) The issue of the measures that Germany will take so that the occupying powers will conclude a peace treaty with Germany at an early date and withdraw the occupying forces from all of Germany.

	(7) The issue of the joint measures that will be taken to develop Germany's domestic trade and ensure that German goods can be freely transported to the world market. The representatives of the German Democratic Republic will strive to ensure that West German industrial products can be freely transported to the eastern and southeastern markets, in order to encourage the more rapid development of German civilian industry, and will strive to guide this development to become a path of peaceful cooperation between Germany and other countries and to avoid bloodshed in Europe.

	(8) Other suggestions for achieving unity on the basis of peace and democracy.

In order to discuss the various specific issues regarding the convening of the All-German Constituent Assembly, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic suggests to the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany that the two parliaments each appoint an equal number of representatives to hold negotiations in Berlin. The date of the meeting can be agreed upon by the chairmen of the two parliaments.

　　德意志民主共和国人民议会电波恩议会       
    建议共同召集全德立宪议会       
    讨论保证和平与恢复统一的各项问题
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会于一月三十日举行会议，通过了人民议会中各党派、各团体关于实现德意志民主共和国政府所提成立全德立宪议会的建议致波恩联邦议会的联名电。
    电文宣称：格罗提渥总理一九五○年十一月三十日致联邦总理阿登纳的信中所提关于开始谈判成立全德立宪议会的建议的目的，是在德国本国人民中间获致相互的谅解，以维持和平、恢复德国的统一和缔结和约。这个建议得到了全体德国人民的拥护。可是，阿登纳在今年一月十五日所发表的声明中，拒绝了德意志民主共和国政府的建议，这证明他正在遵循复仇主义和军国主义的政策，引导德国人民走向灾难。
    德意志民主共和国人民议会遵从德国人民渴望和平与统一的意志，兹向德意志联邦共和国议会建议：共同召集全德立宪议会，以便获得为了保证和平和恢复统一所必需解决的一切问题的协议。人民议会声明：出席全德立宪议会的德意志民主共和国代表将受权具体地讨论：
    （一）关于统一德国的条件的建议，特别是关于阿登纳的声明中所提到的成立合法的国家制度，以自由原则为基础的德国政府形式的建议以及关于保障人权与维护和平的建议。
    （二）关于《保卫和平法案》的修正问题，以便使这个法律能扩大到整个德国。
    （三）在全德立宪议会最早的一次会议中，进行关于全德各地警察——其中包括德意志民主共和国的人民警察——的人数、武装和驻地等问题的谈判。如有必要，德意志民主共和国甚至愿在德国尚未恢复统一之前，即在互相同意的原则之下，减少德国东部的警察人数。这些原则对西德也必须有效。
    （四）鉴于阿登纳发表声明说：联邦政府从此以后不作任何军事措施而致力于保障德国的和平，德意志民主共和国代表将受权与联邦共和国的代表一起，以全体德国人民的名义，发表一个声明，规定禁止德国重新军国主义化和成立任何德国军队，并采取必要的措施，保证德国的行政机关与全体人民监督这种禁止的实现。
    （五）关于举行全德的自由、普遍、平等、秘密与直接选举的条件问题。联邦政府的建议与德意志民主共和国代表可能提出的建议都将予以考虑。
    （六）为使占领国家早日与德国订立和约以及将占领军从全德撤出，德国所将采取的措施的问题。
    （七）为发展德国的国内贸易与保证德国商品可以自由地运往世界市场所将采取的共同措施的问题。德意志民主共和国的代表将努力保证西德的工业产品可以自由地运往东部与东南部的市场，以鼓励全德民用工业更为迅速地发展，并将努力引导这一发展成为德国与其他国家和平合作和避免欧洲流血的途径。
    （八）关于在和平与民主的基础上求得统一的其他建议。
    为了讨论关于召开全德立宪议会的各种具体问题，德意志民主共和国人民议会向德意志联邦共和国议会建议，两个议会各指定人数相等的代表，以便在柏林举行谈判。会议日期可由两个议会的主席取得协议。
