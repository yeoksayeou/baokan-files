            Nanjing Bristle Processing Industry Expands Fourfold
    Nanjing's bristle processing industry has seen significant development in the past year, aided by the Nanjing Branch of the China Bristle Company through methods such as purchasing, ordering, loans, and processing. Originally, there were only about twenty processing businesses, but they quickly grew to about a hundred, and the amount of capital also greatly increased. The branch company also helped them transition from individual production methods to collective production and provided regular production guidance, gradually unifying the quality of the industry's products to meet export standards.
            Over 10,000 Unemployed Workers in Nanjing Find Placement
    Since its establishment last May, the Nanjing Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Committee has resolved the employment and living problems of more than 14,000 unemployed workers, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of unemployed workers in the city. Appropriate relief was also provided to more than 30,000 partially unemployed workers. This relief work by the People's Government has been widely supported by unemployed workers.
            Patriotic Production Competition Widely Carried Out in Zhengzhou and Other Places Along the Beijing-Hankou Railway
    The patriotic production competition movement in Zhengzhou and other places along the Beijing-Hankou Railway has been widely and deeply developed. Veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike have played a backbone and leading role in this competition movement. This patriotic production competition movement has now expanded from general workers to engineering and technical personnel and administrative management personnel; from major departments such as train operations, engineering, machinery, and telecommunications to departments such as material depots and hospitals. Over 85% of railway workers and staff on the Xuchang-Xinxiang section have participated in the patriotic production competition movement, with Zhengzhou Central Station reaching 100%. In the competition, production results have significantly improved. Currently, the production competition movement on the Beijing-Hankou Line is developing in depth with the challenge to the Ma Hengchang team as the center.
            State-Owned Trade in Western Hunan Penetrates Rural Market Towns
    The Xiangxi (Western Hunan) region of Hunan Province is extremely rich in local products. Tung oil alone is equivalent to 36.5% of the total value of the region's main crop, rice. Before liberation, this region was plagued by banditry, and urban-rural trade was isolated. Bartering was prevalent in remote areas; local products had no buyers, and farmers lived a very hard life, sometimes going without salt for two or three months. After liberation, the People's Government carried out bandit suppression while promoting urban-rural material exchange. Since its establishment, the state-owned Xiangxi Trading Company has established shops and trade work groups in various market towns and established credit sales relationships with private merchants to purchase local products at reasonable prices, allowing the Renminbi to penetrate rural areas. The company also regularly dispatches trade work groups carrying farmers' daily necessities to work with the bandit suppression troops. Wherever the troops fight, trade organizations are established, which are warmly welcomed by the people. As of the end of last year, the Xiangxi State-Owned Trading Company had 39 branches, spread throughout the region. Statistics show that the region's total output of local products in the past year included more than 5.3 million catties of tung oil, 830,000 catties of edible oil, and more than 300,000 catties of galls, in addition to a large number of cattle hides, green hemp, tea, etc. After local products found a market, the phenomena of bartering and trading in silver dollars and copper coins have been decreasing day by day, and the market for the Renminbi has been expanding.

            湘西国营贸易深入农村集镇
    湖南省湘西地区土产极为丰富，只桐油一项就相当于全区主要农作物稻谷总值的百分之三十六点五。该区在解放前匪患猖獗，城乡贸易隔绝，偏僻地区盛行以物易物；土产没有人买，农民生活很苦，甚至于常有两三个月吃不到食盐的情形。解放以后，人民政府一面进行剿匪，一面开展城乡物资交流。国营湘西贸易公司自成立后就在各集镇设立商店和贸易工作小组，并和私商建立赊销关系，以合理价格收购土产，使人民币深入农村。该公司并经常派遣贸易工作小组携带农民生活必需品随剿匪部队工作，部队打到那里，贸易机构也随着建立到那里，受到人民热烈欢迎。截至去年年底为止，湘西国营贸易公司的分支机构已有三十九个单位，遍布全区。统计一年来全区输出的土产已有桐油五百三十多万斤，食油八十三万斤，五棓子三十多万斤，此外还有大批牛皮、青麻、茶叶等。在土产有了销路以后，各地以物易物和以银元铜毫交易的现象已日益减少，人民币的市场日益扩大。
