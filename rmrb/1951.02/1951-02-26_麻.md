　　Hemp is one of China's major agricultural products. The areas in China that produce hemp are widely distributed, and the yield is very abundant. The most widely used in industry is the raw material for making sacks, such as kenaf, jute, and ramie. The main production areas are Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Taiwan, Hubei, and the northeastern provinces. In 1948, the area planted with jute in the Jiangnan region reached 150,000 mu, with an annual output of 400,000 dan of raw hemp. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the average annual output of ramie in North China was about 500,000 dan, and the annual output of hemp in Northeast China in the past was 300,000 dan. Every year, tens of thousands of working people rely on hemp production for a living. However, before liberation, the reactionary ruling class not only did not support hemp production, but on the contrary, took advantage of the high profits that could be obtained from manufacturing sacks, and therefore lowered the purchase price every year during the hemp harvest. The reasonable price ratio between Zhejiang hemp and rice was about eight dou of rice per dan of raw hemp. However, when sold by farmers, the price was suppressed to three or four dou of rice per dan of raw hemp, and the largest illegal profits were plundered by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie's commercial institutions. This cruel exploitation left the vast number of farmers in dire straits and lost their confidence in growing hemp. Therefore, in 1949, jute production in the Jiangnan area was halved compared to 1948. China's original hemp production was so devastated by the various abuses of the past reactionary government that imported sacks long occupied a dominant position in the Chinese market.
　　Sacks are essential for transporting and storing food, salt, cement, and for bundling and packaging. For food alone, in addition to making the most of old sacks, the minimum number of new sacks needed to be replenished each year is more than ten million. The need for sacks is directly proportional to the development of production and the advancement of transportation. With the development of the New Democratic economy, the national demand for sacks will increase further. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, China did not have its own sack-making factories and relied entirely on foreign supplies. In 1928, the total number of sacks imported reached more than 100 million, the peak of sack imports. Ninety percent of these were imported from India. Later, the forces of imperialism penetrated deeper into China, and the Japanese set up factories in China to manufacture sacks, exploiting Chinese raw materials and cheap labor to plunder the wealth of the Chinese people. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries took over the Japanese sack-making factories in China; however, production was still aimed at enriching themselves. During this period, the number of sacks regularly imported from foreign countries was still around 20 to 30 million per year. Assuming that an average of 25 million sacks were imported each year before liberation, the value of these 25 million sacks would be enough to build two well-equipped factories in China with an annual output of 25 million sacks, and would completely solve the need for sacks.
　　After liberation, the People's Government has attached great importance to the suffering of hemp farmers in the past and the importance of sack production. The government has purchased many good kenaf seeds from the Soviet Union and has promoted planting in the Northeast and North China. Since 1950, the acreage planted with hemp has gradually expanded. Last year, the area planted with hemp in Zhejiang exceeded the previous highest level. It is estimated that jute production in Zhejiang in 1950 exceeded the highest pre-liberation output (1948) by 61.7 percent. Ramie production in North China increased by 28 percent compared to 1949. Kenaf production in Northeast China in 1950 reached three times that of 1949.
　　In order to ensure the supply of raw hemp, improve the quality of raw hemp, and protect the interests of hemp farmers, the government has organized joint hemp purchasing committees in East China and North China, based on regions, and has established grading standards, and inspection standards for raw and processed hemp. In order to enhance farmers' confidence in growing hemp, the Zhejiang Raw Hemp Joint Purchasing Agency specially convened a meeting of hemp farmer representatives to study purchasing methods and invited hemp farmer representatives to visit machine sack factories. The hemp farmer representatives saw large quantities of hemp being made into sacks in the factory and told the hemp farmers upon their return: The country has such a large sack factory, so we no longer have to worry about growing hemp without a market. Originally, hemp farmers, having suffered losses under the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, where the selling price was not enough to cover the cost, were unwilling to trim the tops and tails when selling hemp, or mixed sand and soil into the hemp. After the hemp farmer representatives visited the sack factory, they saw that untrimmed and un-tailed raw hemp and hemp mixed with sand and soil added many difficulties to the process of weaving sacks, and they consciously strictly implemented the inspection standards and improved the quality of the hemp. In 1950, the quality of Grade C hemp in Zhejiang reached the standard of Grade A hemp in 1949. The People's Government has established reasonable hemp-grain price ratios for the purchase price of hemp. The purchase price of jute in East China is based on the standard of eight dou of rice actually obtained by the hemp farmer per dan, with an increase of 3 percent for trimmed tops and tails. The purchase price in North China is a minimum of 2.5 jin of millet per jin of medium-grade ramie and a maximum of 3 jin of millet, converted according to the average market price in the purchasing area. The minimum purchase price of kenaf is 3 jin of millet and the maximum is 3.5 jin of millet. In order to stabilize hemp prices, the East China Public-Private Joint Hemp Purchasing Office trained more than 470 experienced hemp inspectors to engage in hemp purchasing. Hemp farmers, having made profits, were also willing to sell the hemp they had stored. At the same time, hemp prices were also quite stable, such as the price of processed hemp in East China, which remained stable between 440,000 and 50,000 yuan per dan. Hemp prices in North China also fluctuated very little. This was a phenomenon that had never occurred before liberation. Through the purchase of hemp, the living standards of the people in the hemp-producing areas have greatly improved. Taking the Daye Special District of Hubei Province as an example, in 1949, a family of eight could only buy one bolt of cloth per year and eat only 2.5 jin of salt per month. In 1950, they could buy four bolts of cloth per year and eat 3.5 to 4 jin of salt per month. Hemp farmers are even more satisfied with the government's consideration in terms of price.
　　The joint hemp purchasing committees in various localities were prepared based on the decisions made at the National Wool and Hemp Conference in June 1950 on the issue of joint raw material purchasing. Formal purchasing began after September 1950. From September to December 1950, the East China Joint Purchasing Committee purchased a total of 400,000 shi dan of raw hemp, and the North China Committee purchased 120,000 shi dan, ensuring the supply of raw materials to sack factories in the producing areas. Because China's hemp production cannot fully meet industrial needs, some sacks are still imported. However, in 1951, with the government's planned support, national jute production will increase by 43 percent compared to 1950, ramie will increase by 18 percent, kenaf will increase by 458 percent, and total production will increase by 117 percent. This number is the most powerful guarantee for the development of the national sack industry; it also guarantees the livelihoods of millions of hemp farmers.

　　麻
    程闻迟
    麻是中国主要农产品之一。中国产麻的地区分布很广，产量也很丰富。在工业上用途最广的是制造麻袋的原料，如洋麻、黄麻、青麻，其主要的产区在浙江、江苏、安徽、山东、河北、江西、广东、广西、台湾、湖北与东北各省。一九四八年江南种植黄麻面积达十五万亩，年产生麻四十万担，华北青麻在抗战以前每年的平均产量约五十万担，东北过去每年产麻三十万担。每年都有成千成万的劳动人民，依靠着麻的生产为生。然而解放前，反动统治阶级对于麻的生产不但不扶持，相反的，利用制造麻袋可以获得厚利，便在每年收割麻时杀价收购。浙江麻与米的合理比价，一担生麻约合米八斗。但在农民手里卖出时，则被压价到每担生麻折合米三、四斗，最大的非法利润被官僚资产阶级的商业机构掠夺了。这种残酷的剥削，使广大农民处于绝境，丧失了种麻的信心。因此一九四九年，在江南地区，黄麻产量比一九四八年锐减一半。我国原麻的生产因为受到过去反动政府的种种摧残，以致外国输入的麻袋，在中国市场上长久地占着统治地位。
    麻袋是运输与贮藏食粮、盐、水泥、捆扎包装的必需品。单就食粮一项，除尽量利用旧麻袋外，每年需要补充新麻袋的最低数量在一千万条以上。麻袋的需要，与生产的发展、交通运输的发达是成正比的。随着新民主主义经济的发展，全国对于麻袋的需要将更增加。抗日战争前中国自己没有制麻袋的工厂，全部依赖国外的供给，一九二八年输入麻袋总数达一亿条以上，是麻袋输入的最高峰。其中百分之九十是由印度输入的。以后帝国主义势力更深入中国，日本人在中国设厂制造麻袋，利用中国原料与廉价的劳动力，剥削中国人民财富。抗日胜利后，国民党反动派接收了日本在中国的制麻袋厂；但生产上依然以搜括肥私为目的。在这时期经常从外国输入的麻袋，每年仍在二、三千万条左右。假设解放前每年平均输入麻袋二千五百万条，这二千五百万条麻袋的价值，即足够在中国增建二个设备优良的年产二千五百万条麻袋的工厂，并能全部解决了麻袋的需要。
    解放后，人民政府极为重视过去麻农所受的疾苦，与麻袋生产的重要。政府从苏联购进了许多良好洋麻种子，已经在东北、华北推广播种。自一九五○年起，种麻的田亩已逐渐扩充起来，去年浙江种麻面积，即超过以往最高水平。估计一九五○年浙江黄麻产量超过解放前最高产量（一九四八年）百分之六十一点七。华北青麻的产量比一九四九年提高百分之二八。东北洋麻一九五○年的产量达到一九四九年的三倍。
    政府为保证原麻的供应，提高原麻的品质，保障麻农的利益，在华东、华北组织了以地区为单位的联合购麻委员会；订立等级标准、生麻与熟麻检验标准。为了增强农民种麻的信心，浙江的原麻联购机构，曾特别召集麻农代表开会，研究收购办法；并招待麻农代表参观机器麻袋厂。麻农代表看见大批的麻在工厂中制成麻袋，回去告诉麻农：国家有这样大的麻袋厂，再也不怕种了麻没有销路了。本来麻农因为过去吃了国民党反动派的亏，售价不够成本，卖麻时不肯斩头理梢，或者麻里渗杂沙土。麻农代表参观麻袋工厂后，看见未经斩头理梢与渗杂沙土的生麻，在织麻袋过程中增加了许多困难，他们就自觉地厉行了检验标准，提高了麻的品质。一九五○年浙江丙级麻的品质，已可达到一九四九年甲级麻的标准。对收购麻的价格，人民政府订立了合理的麻粮比价。华东收购黄麻价格，每担以麻农实得八斗米为标准，斩头理梢的增加百分之三的价格。华北收购价格，中级青麻每斤最低合小米二斤半，最高合小米三斤，按收购地平均市价折合，洋麻最低收购价格合小米三斤，最高合小米三斤半。为了稳定麻价，华东区公私联合购麻处，训练了四百七十多个对麻的检验有经验的干部，从事收麻工作，麻农有了利润，也都愿意将收藏的麻卖出。同时麻价也相当稳定，如华东熟麻价格每担一直保持在四十四、五万元之间。华北麻价也极少波动。这是解放前没有过的现象。通过对麻的收购，使产麻区人民的生活水平大大提高了。以湖北省大冶专区为例，在一九四九年，八口之家每年只买布一匹，每月吃盐两斤半，一九五○年全年可买布四匹，每月可吃盐三斤半到四斤。麻农对政府在价格上的照顾，更为满意。
    各地的联合购麻委员会，是根据一九五○年六月全国毛麻会议，对原料联购问题所作的决定开始筹备的。正式收购在一九五○年九月以后。自一九五○年九月到十二月，通过联购委员会华东共收购了生麻四十万市担，华北收购了十二万市担，保证了产地麻袋工厂原料的供应。因为我国麻的产量还不能充分满足工业上的需要，所以目前麻袋还有部分进口。但一九五一年在政府有计划的扶植下，全国黄麻产量将比一九五○年增加百分之四十三，青麻将增加百分之十八，洋麻将增加百分之四百五十八，总的产量将增加百分之一百一十七。这个数目对于全国麻袋工业的发展是最有力的保证；同时也使千百万麻农的生活得到了保障。
