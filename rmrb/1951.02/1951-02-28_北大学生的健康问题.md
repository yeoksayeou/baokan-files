　　Peking University Students' Health Problems
　　Bo Sheng
　　Peking University is one of the highest institutions of learning in the country, with over two thousand students. The unhealthy conditions of students left over from the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the past are still a serious problem that needs to be overcome urgently. A considerable number of students are sick, mainly with lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, and trachoma. In May of last year, out of 1,350 male students X-rayed, 156 had lung disease, accounting for 11.5 percent; out of 290 female students X-rayed, 12 had lung disease, accounting for 4.1 percent. Before liberation, the health of Peking University students was even worse: an X-ray examination in 1948 showed that 18.2 percent of 1,442 students had lung disease. After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, students' health began to be valued, and students' lives improved initially, so their physical health also improved. However, this progress is still far from enough. This is partly due to objective difficulties that limit health care work, and on the other hand, it is because the school leadership and the students themselves do not pay enough attention to health education. First of all, the curriculum is too heavy. Students in the science and engineering colleges do experiments, sometimes from after lunch until after dinner, which not only takes up time for extracurricular activities, but also affects meal times. For health care, the curriculum must be appropriately streamlined and adjusted. At Peking University, although physical education is a required course, it is not valued enough in practice, only taken for two years, and the sports equipment is not good. Some students are simply unwilling to attend the two-hour physical education class each week. After the Beijing Municipal Games were held last October, morning exercises were implemented at Peking University. Initially, it was very energetic, but later the number of people participating in morning exercises gradually decreased.
　　Secondly, the school's medical and health facilities are not sufficient. The school clinic is very small due to limited material conditions. Currently, there are three doctors (one of whom works only half a day) and four nurses. The school clinic's funding mainly relies on the school providing each student with four catties of millet per month for medical expenses, of which only one-half is used here, and the other two catties of millet are used as medical subsidies for students' acute and serious illnesses. On average, five or six students get acute and serious illnesses every month, so both aspects of funding are very limited. Currently, among the students residing on campus in the arts, law, and science colleges at Peking University, more than 60 students with lung disease are living in isolation. Among the new students who enrolled last year, another eleven have now been found to have contracted lung disease. There are also more than ten students with lung disease in the engineering college. The school has decided to conduct another X-ray examination in March this year to thoroughly check the health of all students.
　　The school's environmental sanitation is also not very good. The sixty-odd students who have been diagnosed with lung disease have been living in the West Residence's East Courtyard, but it is difficult to have a quiet recuperation due to the poor dormitory conditions. The sanitary facilities in the dining hall and kitchen are very poor. In the library, the place is small, there are many people, and the air is quite bad. After a recent cleaning and disinfection, the situation has improved, and the air is much fresher.
　　In terms of diet and nutrition, general students and students with lung disease already eat separately. Students with lung disease have organized a nutritional meal group, paying 85 catties of millet per month for food, but because there are few people, the food is not good. General students are all enrolled in the Peking University dining group, eating two types of food: rice and steamed sponge cake, each costing 70 catties of millet per month. The dishes with rice are worse, and the dishes with steamed sponge cake are better. Generally speaking, students' food still needs to be improved within possible limits.
　　All of the above, although there are some objective constraints, the current situation can be improved as long as difficulties are overcome as much as possible within possible limits.
　　Another reason affecting students' health is that the students themselves do not pay enough attention to health care. Many students do not have hygienic habits, spitting and blowing their noses everywhere, and eating snacks. Many students have irregular daily lives, often disregarding their health for work or study, staying up for several nights. Some students also often do not wash or change their shirts, which is very unhygienic. All of this affects students' health.
　　In terms of extracurricular activities, although the Student Union's Literature and Entertainment Department and Sports Department have organized many activities, students do not actively participate. Many clubs' recreational activities are solely for the purpose of completing certain political education goals, and neglect the legitimate entertainment aspect.
　　Recently, the Peking University Student Union's Health and Medical Department and the school clinic started a "Health and Medical" wall newspaper to increase students' attention to health care. In addition to introducing general health knowledge, it also focuses on reporting the health conditions of students throughout the school, making special introductions to some epidemic diseases, and opening a "Medical Questions and Answers" column. The school clinic has also formulated a central work plan for this year based on the principle of prevention first and treatment second. These are all necessary. As long as the school leadership and students pay more attention to students' health education, cooperate to find solutions, overcome certain objective difficulties within possible limits, and implement the policy of prevention is more important than treatment, we believe that the health of Peking University students can be greatly improved.

　　北大学生的健康问题
    柏生
    北京大学是全国最高学府之一，现有二千多学生。过去国民党反动派统治期遗留下来的学生不健康现象至今仍是一个亟待克服的严重问题，学生中有病的相当多，最主要的是肺病、肠胃病、和砂眼。去年五月间，在全校一千三百五十个男同学的透视中，一百五十六人有肺病，占百分之十一点五；在二百九十个女同学的透视中，十二人有肺病，占百分之四点一。在未解放前，北大同学健康情形更坏：一九四八年进行过一次透视，一千四百四十二个同学中，有百分之十八点二有肺病。解放后，在人民政府的领导下，同学的健康开始得到重视，同学们的生活初步改善，因此身体健康也有了进步。但这种进步仍非常不够。这一方面由于客观的困难，使保健工作受了限制，而另一方面，则由于学校领导上和同学们自己对健康教育的重视还不够。首先是课程过于繁重。理工学院的同学们作实验，有时从午饭后一直作到晚饭后，不但占去了课外活动的时间，而且影响了吃饭的时间。为了保健，必须把课程作适当的精简和调整。在北大，体育课虽是必修课，但实际上被重视不够，只修两年，体育设备也不好。每星期两小时的体育课，有的同学根本不愿意去上。去年十月，北京市开了运动会后，早操在北大实行起来了，最初很起劲，但后来参加早操的人数又逐渐少了。
    其次是学校医药卫生的设备还不够。校医室由于物质条件的限制，规模很小。目前有三个医生（其中一个只工作半日）四位护士。校医室经费主要是靠校方每月发给每个同学四斤小米的医药费，其中只有二分之一用在这里，另外两斤小米用作同学们的急病重病医药补助金。平均每月总有五六个同学得急重病，因此两方面经费都很有限。目前北大住校的文、法、理三院同学中，有肺病而被隔离住宿的有六十余人。在去年入学的新同学中，现在又发现有十一人已染肺病。工学院同学有肺病的也有十余人。该校决定在今年三月再来一次透视，彻底检查全校同学的健康。
    该校环境卫生也不很好。已检查出有肺病的六十余位同学，虽然已分住在西斋东院，但因宿舍条件不够好，很难安静地疗养。饭厅与厨房的卫生设备都很差。图书馆内，地方小，人又多，空气相当坏。最近经过一次洗刷消毒后，情况才有了改进，空气清新得多了。
    在饮食营养方面，一般同学与有肺病的同学已经分食。有肺病的同学组织了一个营养膳团，每月缴八十五斤小米的伙食费，但因人少，伙食并不好。一般同学都在北大膳团包伙，分吃大米与丝糕两种，每种每月伙食费均为七十斤小米。吃大米的菜坏些，吃丝糕的菜要好些。一般说来，同学们的伙食还需要在可能范围内加以改善。
    上述一切，虽有某些客观条件的限制，但只要在可能范围内尽量克服困难，目前的情况是可以改进的。
    影响同学健康的另一个原因，就是同学们自己对保健方面不够注意。许多同学没有卫生习惯，随地吐痰，甩鼻涕，吃零食。许多同学日常生活不规律，为了工作或学习，时常不顾自己的身体，几夜不睡眠。也有些同学衬衣经常不洗不换，弄得很不卫生。凡此一切都影响同学们的健康。
    在课外活动方面，虽然学生会的文娱部、体育部都组织了许多活动，但同学们并不踊跃参加。许多社团的文娱活动，单纯为了完成一定的政治教育目的，而忽略了正当娱乐性的一面。
    最近北大学生会的卫生医药部和校医室为了提高同学们对保健的注意，开始办了一个“卫生医药”壁报，除了介绍一般的卫生常识外，并着重报道全校同学健康情况，对一些流行病做专题介绍，并开辟了“医药问答”栏，校医室并根据预防为主，治疗为辅的方针，制定了本年度的中心工作计划。这些都是必要的。只要学校领导上和同学们都更加重视学生的保健教育，合作想办法，在可能范围内克服某些客观的困难，贯彻防重于治的方针，我们相信北大同学的健康情况是能够很好地改进的。
