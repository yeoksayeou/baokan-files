　　Zhejiang Investigates Farmers' Purchasing Power

    [This Newspaper] To carry out urban-rural material exchange in a planned way and overcome blindness in trade work, the Department of Commerce of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government conducted a typical survey of the purchasing power of farmers in Zhejiang Province after the autumn harvest last year. Now, based on the initial experience gained, and in combination with the land reform movement throughout the province, further arrangements are being made for a more comprehensive investigation and research work.

    According to this typical survey, it is estimated that due to last year's bumper harvest, the average purchasing power of farmers in Zhejiang Province (total income from food, native products, special products, sideline occupations, etc., minus consumption of food, seeds, feed, etc. and agricultural tax) increased by 60% compared with 1949. This year, with the completion of land reform and the result of the People's Government leading liberated farmers to increase production, farmers' purchasing power will be further improved. This purchasing power can only be realized through vigorously purchasing agricultural and sideline products and expanding urban-rural material exchange. Last year, the income from native and special products of farmers in Zhejiang Province accounted for about 18.34% of the total income of farmers, and the income from sideline occupations accounted for about 8.34%. It is estimated that the total number of native products, special products and sideline products that farmers need to sell is about five times the number of grains that need to be sold in terms of rice. Therefore, farmers urgently demand that state-owned trading organizations, cooperatives, and private businesses purchase and promote their native and special products, and supply them with the means of production and living materials they need.

    In the past, due to the lack of investigation and research on the actual situation in rural areas by state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives, the phenomenon of "goods not prepared for sale, goods prepared difficult to sell" occurred in the work. Last year, although the state-owned trading company's supply of fertilizer to the entire province exceeded the original plan by ten times, it still could not meet the needs of farmers. Farmers in Wenzhou, Taizhou, Lishui and other places all needed to add agricultural tools after the autumn harvest last year. At that time, the turnover of private native iron shops temporarily increased tenfold, but the local cooperatives were not prepared for the supply of agricultural tools. Generally, farmers need cheap and durable blue coarse cloth and printed foreign cloth. Last year, the state-owned trading company supplied white fine cloth with higher prices, and farmers were unwilling to buy it. The printed bed sheets, long stockings for women, and raincoats supplied by state-owned department stores in Shengxian and Lishui had not sold a single piece for several months. After this survey, this year's trade work in Zhejiang Province will correct this disconnect.

### 浙江调查农民购买力

　　浙江调查农民购买力
    【本报讯】为了有计划地开展城乡物资交流，克服贸易工作中的盲目性，浙江省人民政府商业厅曾对去年秋收后浙江省农民的购买力进行典型调查。现正在取得初步经验的基础上，结合全省土地改革运动，进一步布置比较全面的调查研究工作。
    根据这次典型调查估计，浙江省农民由于去年丰收，每人平均购买力（食粮、土产、特产、副业等总收入，减去吃粮、种子、饲料等消费及农业税）较一九四九年增加百分之六十。今年土地改革完成以及人民政府领导翻身农民增产的结果，农民购买力将更见提高。这些购买力是要通过大力收购农、副产品和扩大城乡物资交流才能实现的。浙省农民去年的土产、特产收入约占农民总收入的百分之十八点三四，副业收入约占百分之八点三四。估计农民需要售出的土产、特产与副产品总数折成大米约五倍于需要售出的粮食数。因此，农民迫切要求国营贸易机构、合作社和私营商业去收购并推销他们的土产、特产品，供给他们所需的生产资料和生活资料。
    过去由于国营贸易机构和合作社对农村实际情况缺乏调查研究，在工作中曾发生“销货不备，备货难销”的现象。去年国营贸易公司对全省肥料供应量虽超过了原计划的十倍，但还不能满足农民的要求。温州、台州、丽水等地农民在去年秋收后都需要添补农具，当时私营土铁店的营业额一时增达十倍，但是当地合作社对农具的供应却没有准备。一般农民需要价廉质牢的蓝色粗布和花洋布，去年国营贸易公司供应的都是价格较高的白细布，农民都不愿买。嵊县和丽水的国营百货公司供应的印花被单、长统女袜和雨衣等，几个月没有卖出过一件。经过这次调查，今年浙江省的贸易工作将纠正这种脱节现象。
