The scope of color printed pictures includes a wide range of categories such as New Year pictures, calendar pictures, serial comic strips, portraits of leaders, teaching charts, etc. The number of publications is extremely large, and the distribution covers the whole country. Therefore, how to reform the old color printed pictures is an extremely important issue.

Regarding the reform policy of this work, it should be the same as the reform work of all old cultural undertakings: neither too hasty to carry out reforms with crude methods, attempting to deal with those harmful publications by means of prohibition and restriction; at the same time, we must not be accommodating and let them run freely. Therefore, the government's cultural and educational authorities must actively, patiently, and step-by-step help them to carry out reforms.

The focus of the transformation of color printed pictures is the content, not the form. Moreover, we should emphasize the adoption of diverse methods of expression that are both acceptable to the masses and familiar to the authors. The technique of using airbrushing with watercolors, which is commonly used by calendar picture artists, is one example. We must never regard the method of "single-line flat coloring" as the only method of expression. From the situation in the old liberated areas in the past, the reason why the method of "single-line flat coloring" was widely promoted was partly because it was a kind of folk form loved by the masses, and partly because it was more suitable for the printing conditions at that time. Today, under different printing conditions and different mass appreciation standards, there is absolutely no reason to regard "single-line flat coloring" as the only form of expression. Similarly, for other forms of expression that have been familiar to and loved by the masses, there is absolutely no reason to regard them as "vulgar," "glib," and "low-level" and resolutely oppose them.

The content reform of color printed pictures should be based on the original foundation and appropriately distinguish and gradually improve and enhance it. First of all, within the original scope of subject matter, it is necessary to identify which are harmful to the people, which are beneficial or harmless to the people, which should be reformed first, and which can be gradually changed.

For example, beauty paintings can still be painted. What needs to be reformed is to change those "beauties" of the exploiting class who do not engage in production into beauties of the working people who participate in production. Young women picking tea, girls picking cotton, and all women engaged in productive labor can be used as the theme characters of new beauty calendar pictures. Don't be harsh on calendar picture artists. If they correctly express the beauty of laborers in their works, thereby arousing the audience's attention to labor and laborers, this is helping the shift in social atmosphere.

Landscape paintings can still be painted. When the people become the masters of the country and gradually improve in living standards, beautiful scenery is no longer the enjoyment of a few people. Moreover, we can connect beautiful scenery with a better life, and we can connect the people's love for the beautiful mountains and rivers with their love for the motherland. Do not demand that landscape painters must express themes outside of landscape painting that they are not familiar with, but should specifically help them gradually permeate new thoughts and feelings into landscape paintings.

All themes such as "auspiciousness" and "welfare" that express the psychological desires of the masses can still be painted. What needs to be improved is to give correct and life-development guidance to these simple psychological desires. (For example, if you want to "get rich," you must guide them to step up production. If you want "more children," you must guide them to pay attention to maternal and child hygiene.) Do not regard the people's reasonable hopes for life as feudal superstition and outdated ideas. We should respect the people's reasonable hopes and critically use these auspicious themes.

Historical stories and folk tales should still be painted. What needs to be reformed is only the content that instills feudal morality and servile ideas, and what needs to be deleted are only those ugly, barbaric, and terrifying images (such as bound feet, braids, opium smoking, murderous torture, and the eighteen levels of hell, etc.). Moreover, we can combine the pictures of historical stories and folk tales with the promotion of patriotism, and with the promotion of the traditional excellent qualities of the Chinese people such as diligence, bravery, kindness, and wisdom. Do not require painters to produce themes with modern content across the board, and do not think that only drawing machines, farm tools, and guns is considered to be integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers. For painters who are accustomed to drawing historical themes, this requirement is to force them to create those so-called "avoiding the important and taking the light" and "stereotyped" formulaic pictures. What we should oppose are those "leftist" arguments that abandon historical traditions and believe that the masses no longer want old themes; what we should oppose are those works that violate historical viewpoints and forcibly add slogans to historical stories and folk tales, so-called new content.

On the basis of the original foundation, gradually reform from the content first. This is the specific policy for reforming the publication work of old color printed pictures. Only in this way can we liberate the old painters from ideological constraints, break the publishers' ideological concerns, and open up a broad road in the new mass picture cause.

The improvement of the publication work of old color printed pictures mainly relies on the painters who originally engaged in this kind of painting and the publishers who originally engaged in this kind of publication, because they have relatively skilled painting techniques and relatively rich publication experience. Before their old ideological styles have changed, these techniques and experiences may become obstacles to their business progress; but when they learn new ideas and new styles, their techniques and experiences can help develop new cultural and educational undertakings. Therefore, we should unite them, transform their thinking in unity, help them improve their business, and rely on them to carry out this reform work.

For the old painters who have been engaged in painting work for many years, in addition to organizing them to study politics and business, helping them to go deep into reality and experience life, we should also provide them with the materials and reference materials they need for creation in various ways, and provide them with active and constructive opinions to help them solve specific difficulties and problems in business improvement.

For publishers, we should not expect them to engage in publishing work without making money, and we must take care of them so that they do not suffer losses in their business. We should explain to them that today's making money cannot violate the interests of the people. Improving publishing work is precisely to enable their business to develop under the premise of conforming to the interests of the people. All publishing behaviors that violate the interests of the people should be corrected.

　　旧彩印图画的改革问题
　　蔡若虹
    彩印图画范围包括年画、月份牌画、连环故事画、领袖像、教学挂图等等广泛的类别，出版数量极大，发行遍及全国。因此，如何改革旧有彩印图画是一极重要的问题。
    关于这一工作的改造方针，应该和一切旧有文化事业的改造工作一样，既不能过于性急地用粗暴方法进行改革，企图用禁止和限制入境的办法来对付那些有害的出版物；同时，也不能迁就地听其放任自流，所以政府文教主管部门必须主动地、耐心地、有步骤地帮助他们进行改革。
    彩印图画的改造重点是内容而不是形式。而且，我们应该强调在表现方法上采用多种多样的、既为群众所能接受又为作者所习惯运用的形式。月份牌画家们所习惯采用的擦笔画加水彩就是一个例子。绝不能把什么“单线平涂”的方法当做唯一的表现方法。从过去老解放区的情况来说，“单线平涂”的方法其所以广泛推行，一方面是由于它是群众所喜爱的民间形式的一种，一方面也由于它比较适合于当时的印刷条件的缘故。今天，在不同的印刷条件和不同的群众欣赏水准之下，就完全没有把“单线平涂”当作唯一的表现形式的理由。同样，对于其它的那些已被群众所熟悉所喜爱的表现形式来说，也完全没有把它们看作是“庸俗的”“油滑的”“低级的”而加以坚决反对的理由。
    彩印图画的内容改革，应该是在原有的基础上加以适当的甄别和逐步的改进与提高。首先要在原有的题材范围之内，辨别那些是对人民有害的，那些是对人民有益的或无害的，那些是应该首先进行改革的，那些是可以逐渐加以改变的。
    譬如说，美女画仍旧可以画，需要改革的是将那些不事生产的剥削阶级的“美女”改换为参加生产的劳动人民的美女。采茶的少妇、摘棉花的姑娘、以及一切从事生产劳动的妇女，都可以作为新美女月份牌画片的主题人物。对月份牌画家们不要苛求，如果他们在作品中正确地表现了劳动者的美丽，从而引起观众对于劳动和劳动者的重视，这就是帮助了社会风气的转移。
    风景画也仍旧是可以画的。当人民成为国家的主人，而且在生活水平上逐渐提高的时候，美丽的风景就不再是少数人的享用品了。而且，我们可以将美丽的风景和美好的生活联系起来，可以将人民对于大好山河的热爱和对于祖国的热爱联系起来。不要苛求风景画作者们一定去表现风景画以外的他们所不熟悉的主题，而应具体帮助他们如何在风景画中逐渐渗透进新的思想情感。
    一切表现群众心理愿望的“吉祥”“福利”之类的题材都仍旧是可以画的。需要改进的，是将这些朴素的心理愿望加以正确的合乎生活发展的指引。（例如：希望“发财”，就要指引他们加紧生产。希望“多子”，就要指引他们注意妇婴卫生。）不要将人民对于生活的合理希望一律看作封建迷信和陈腐思想，应该尊重人民的合理希望，应该有批判地运用这些吉利的题材。
    历史故事与民间传说仍旧是应该画的。需要改革的仅仅是那些灌输封建道德和奴才思想的内容，需要删除的，仅仅是那些丑恶的、野蛮的、恐怖的形象（如小脚、拖辫子、抽大烟、杀人的酷刑和十八地狱等等）。而且，我们可以将历史故事与民间传说的图画和发扬爱国主义精神结合起来，和发扬中国人民的勤劳、勇敢、善良、智慧等等传统的优良品质结合起来。不要要求画家们一律制作现代内容的题材，不要认为只有画机器、农具、枪炮才算是与工农兵结合。对于习惯于绘制历史题材的画家们来说，这种要求是逼迫他们制造那些所谓“避重就轻”的“千篇一律”的八股图画。我们应该反对的，是那些抛弃历史传统的，认为群众已经不要旧题材的作品的“左”的论调；我们应该反对的，是那些违反历史观点的硬在历史故事和民间传说中乱加标语口号的所谓新内容的作品。
    在原有的基础上，先从内容入手逐步加以改革，这就是改革旧有彩印图画出版工作的具体方针。只有这样做，才能够解除老画家们思想上的束缚，才能打破出版家们思想上的顾虑，才能在新的大众图画事业上开辟广阔的道路。
    旧有彩印图画出版工作的改进，主要是依靠原来就从事此种绘画的画家们和原来就从事此种出版工作的出版家们，因为他们有较为熟练的绘画技术和较为丰富的出版经验。在他们的旧的思想作风没有改变之前，这些技术与经验都可能成为他们业务进步上的障碍；可是当他们学得了新的思想，新的作风以后，他们的技术与经验就可以帮助发展新文化教育事业。所以，我们应该团结他们，在团结中改造他们的思想，帮助他们业务上的进步，并且依靠他们来进行这一改革工作。
    对于从事绘画工作多年的老画家们，除了组织他们政治学习与业务学习，帮助他们深入实际和体验生活，还应多方供给他们在创作上所需要的材料和参考资料，向他们提供积极的建设性的意见，以帮助他们解决业务改进上的具体困难和问题。
    对于出版家们，我们不要希望他们不为赚钱而从事出版工作，而且要照顾他们不能在营业上受到损失。应该向他们解释，今天的赚钱不能与人民的利益有所违背。改进出版工作，正是为了他们在符合于人民利益的前提下使他们的营业能够得到发展。凡是违背人民的利益而从事出版的行为都是应该纠正的。
