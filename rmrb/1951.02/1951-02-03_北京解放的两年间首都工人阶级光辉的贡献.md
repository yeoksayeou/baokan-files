　　The Glorious Contribution of the Capital's Working Class in the Two Years Since the Liberation of Beijing
    Nie Rongzhen, Mayor of Beijing

    Two years ago today, the working class of Beijing was welcoming its own troops back to the city with long-awaited enthusiasm. At that time, they said: From this day on, the working class of Beijing has been transformed from slaves of machines to masters of machines.

    Over the past two years, the working class of Beijing has put its solemn declaration into practice with its own actions. With the consciousness of being masters, with selfless labor enthusiasm, and with their own wisdom and creativity, they have actively participated in the construction of the people's capital in all aspects, and have made encouraging and glorious contributions.

    After liberation, the working class united and established and developed its own class organization. In the past two years, more than 185,000 employees, accounting for approximately 63.34 percent of the city's total, from public and private enterprises, factories, shops, and cultural, educational, and health units, have joined the trade union. Many outstanding members have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    Under the organization of the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and with the leadership and assistance of the administrative and trade union departments of various factories, workers have established a new labor attitude, which they call "master attitude." Democratic reforms have been implemented in factories, and many advanced producers have served as members of the factory management committees, and some have even served as factory directors. Countless outstanding workers love the people's own factories, so rationalization proposals have been put forward. Work has been improved, and there are more and more suggestions. For example, the employees of eight factories, including the Shijingshan Power Plant, put forward 1,113 rationalization proposals in just three months of April, May, and June last year. The repair and manufacturing plant of the Tram Company realized 28 technical improvements from January to May last year. The Changxindian Railway Factory accepted workers' suggestions to implement assembly line operations and work specialization. In the first month, the output of the foundry shop increased by 35 percent. Beijing Transportation Company accepted workers' suggestions to implement "combined opening and repair," and the daily number of vehicles increased from 34 to 62. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the workers shouted the resounding slogan "The factory is the battlefield, and the tool is the weapon," and launched a wave of patriotic production competition. The Liulihe Cement Factory and the Shijingshan Power Plant, where the workers are the factory directors, have achieved significant results. The Liulihe Cement Factory completed the total output of four years and three months during the enemy and puppet rule in eleven months and twenty-four days last year; the power generation of Shijingshan exceeded the highest record in the past, basically eliminated accidents, ensured that the city would not lose power, reduced costs, and increased wealth by 2.9 billion yuan. Creations and inventions have also appeared. For example, Hou Deyuan of the Telecommunications Bureau invented the 88-type T-type route crossing, which reduces crosstalk, missed calls, and errors, saving 1.8 million catties of millet in manpower and material resources over the past year. Zhu Lin of the Public Transport Company modified gas vehicles to reduce fuel costs by one-fifth. Shi Chongzhen of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant used gasified iron-making coal instead of burning coal, saving 1,000 tons of coal per day. From these endless creations and inventions, it can be seen that the wisdom of the working class, which has been suppressed for generations, has begun to be brought into play.

    The workers of private factories and shops, in the position of the leading class, and in line with the policy of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production," have also greatly improved the level of production. In a period after the unification of financial and economic work last year, the workers assisted the capitalists to overcome the temporary difficulties of industry and commerce, and made great contributions. According to the survey materials of 67 factories and shops in August last year, due to the fact that the working class even adopted various methods such as voluntarily reducing wages and taking turns to go home, 45 of them improved the quality, increased the output and sales, and expanded the turnover. The other 22 have also maintained themselves. Some private factories have also launched patriotic production competitions, and have achieved results. For example, the output of Cihua Weaving Factory in November last year increased by 14.7 percent compared with October, the rate of returned cloth decreased from 3.1 percent to 0.7 percent, and the number of lines made by female workers increased from 56 yards to 70 yards per day.

    The liberated workers actively participate in political life. Among the representatives of the first session of the second municipal people's congress exercising the functions of the people's congress, the trade union representatives ranked first, and the worker representatives among the youth, women and other representatives were not included. It was such a meeting of representatives that elected the mayor, deputy mayor, and government members of Beijing. Wang Wenbin, deputy director of Shijingshan Power Plant, was also elected as a government member this time. In the district representative meetings held in various districts of the city in 1950, the worker representatives also accounted for the main component. On the other hand, the working class also actively assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. In addition to carrying out anti-spy struggles and strengthening security work, the porters and coal miners also launched a struggle against looting and bullying, and eliminated the feudal remnants that had been pressing on their heads for many years.

    All of the above is just a beginning. The People's Government is running Renmin University, workers' and peasants' quick-training middle schools, various spare-time schools, and short-term training courses, and is absorbing a large number of workers to participate in learning. The workers are also pursuing the improvement of cultural, political, and technical knowledge with the same high enthusiasm as labor production, in order to make greater contributions to the construction of the motherland and the construction of the capital.

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the liberation of Beijing, we have deep respect and gratitude for the great contributions of the working class of the capital. We firmly believe that in the third year after liberation, the great labor of the working class in the capital and throughout the country will surely create more fruitful victories.

### 北京解放的两年间首都工人阶级光辉的贡献

　　北京解放的两年间首都工人阶级光辉的贡献
    北京市市长  聂荣臻
    两年前的今天，北京市的工人阶级正以久别重逢的热情欢迎自己的队伍回到城市里来。那时候他们就说：从这一天起，北京的工人阶级由机器的奴隶变成了机器的主人。
    两年来，北京的工人阶级以自己的行动实践了自己庄严的声明。他们以主人翁的自觉性，以忘我的劳动热情，以自己的智慧和创造力，积极参加了人民首都各方面的建设工作，并在其中作了令人鼓舞的光辉贡献。
    获得解放以后，工人阶级团结一致，建立和发展了自己的阶级组织。两年以来，占全市总数大约百分之六十三点三四的公私企业、工厂、商店和文教卫生职工十八万五千多人参加了工会。其中许多优秀分子加入了共产党和青年团。
    在中国共产党、青年团的组织和各厂行政、工会的领导与帮助底下，工人们建立了新的劳动态度，他们叫做“主人翁态度”。工厂里实行民主改革，许许多多先进生产者担任了工厂管理委员会的委员，有的并担任了厂长。无数的优秀工人热爱人民自己的工厂，于是，合理化建议提出来了。工作得到了改进，建议就更多了。例如石景山发电厂等八个厂职工仅在去年四、五、六三个月，就提出了一千一百一十三件合理化建议。电车公司修造厂自去年一月份到五月份实现了二十八项技术改进。长辛店铁路工厂接受工人建议实行流水作业和工作专业化，第一个月铸工场产量就增加了百分之三十五。北京运输公司接受工人建议实行“开修合一”，每天出车由三十四部增加到六十二部。在抗美援朝运动中，工人们喊出了“工厂就是战场，工具就是武器”的响亮口号，展开了爱国主义生产竞赛的热潮。琉璃河水泥厂和工人当厂长的石景山发电厂因而获得了重要的成绩。琉璃河水泥厂在去年十一个月零二十四天当中，完成了敌伪统治时期四年另三个月的总产量；石景山的发电量超过了过去最高纪录，基本上消灭了事故，保证了全市不停电，减低了成本，增加了财富二十九亿元。创造与发明也出现了。例如电讯局侯德源发明八八式Ｔ式路线交叉，减少串话、漏话、差错，一年来节省人力物力折小米一百八十万斤。公共汽车公司朱临改装煤气车，减少燃料成本五分之一。石景山钢铁厂石重珍利用化铁煤气代替燃煤，每天省煤一千吨。从这些层出不穷的创造与发明上面，可以看出世世代代被压抑着的工人阶级的智慧，是开始发挥出来了。
    私营工厂商店的工人以领导阶级的姿态，本着“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策，也使生产水平提高了很多。在去年财经工作统一以后的一个时期，工人协助资方克服工商业的暂时困难，贡献很大，据去年八月份六十七家工厂商店的调查材料，由于工人阶级甚至采取了自动降低工资、轮流回家等种种方法，其中有四十五家提高了质量，增加了产量和销路，营业额也扩大了。另外的二十二家也都维持了下来。有的私营厂子也展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，而且获得了成绩，如慈华织布厂去年十一月份产量比十月份提高了百分之十四点七，退布率由百分之三点一减低到百分之○点七，女工打线由每天五十六码增加到七十码。
    解放了的工人积极参加政治生活。代行人民代表大会职权的市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议的代表中间，工会代表占了第一位，而青年、妇女等代表中的工人代表还没有包括在内。就是这样的代表会议，选举了北京市的市长、副市长和政府委员。石景山发电厂副厂长王文斌也在这次被选举为政府委员。一九五○年市内各区召开的区代表会议，工人代表也占着主要的成份。另一方面，工人阶级又积极协助政府镇压反革命活动，除了进行反特斗争和加强保卫工作以外，搬运工人和煤矿工人还展开了反搂包、反把头的斗争，肃清了多少年来压在自己头上的封建残余势力。
    上述这一切还只是一个开端。人民政府正在举办着人民大学、工农速成中学、各种业余学校和短期轮训班，大批地吸收工人参加学习。工人们也以和劳动生产同样高涨的热情追求文化、政治和技术知识的提高，以便为祖国的建设，为首都的建设作更大的贡献。
    当此北京解放两周年之际，我们对首都工人阶级的伟大贡献怀着深深的敬意和感谢。我们深信：解放后的第三年，首都和全国工人阶级的伟大劳动必将创造出更为丰硕的胜利果实。
