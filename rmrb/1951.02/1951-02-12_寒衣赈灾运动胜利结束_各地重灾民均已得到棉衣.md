　　Winter Clothing Relief Campaign Successfully Concluded
　　Severely Affected People in Various Regions Have Received Cotton-Padded Clothing
    [Xinhua News Agency] The campaign to solicit winter clothing for disaster victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Hebei has concluded. A total of more than 5.24 million sets of winter clothing (including cash equivalents), as well as some cloth, cotton, shoes, socks, and hats, were collected from all over the country and major cities. These winter clothes were distributed as they were collected, and were given to the disaster victims in the aforementioned four regions last winter. Among them, northern Anhui received the most, totaling more than 3.147 million sets. Severely affected people in all regions have received cotton-padded clothing.
    Last September, the Capital Winter Clothing Solicitation General Committee and local branches were established successively to solicit winter clothing for the disaster victims in the Huai River flood area and the Yongding River flood area in Hebei. Compatriots from all over the country enthusiastically donated, and a nationwide winter clothing relief campaign quickly formed, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the Chinese people. As of November, in just two months, more than five million sets of winter clothing (including cash equivalents) had been collected nationwide, once again proving that the great unity of the Chinese people can overcome all disasters and difficulties.
    During the solicitation, there were many vivid examples of people from all walks of life caring for disaster victims and enthusiastically donating. More than 2,000 employees of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government donated more than 7,300 pieces of winter clothing and more than 7 million yuan in cash. Workers in various factories in Anshan City, Northeast China, generally donated one to five days' wages. Yu Chenghuai, a farmer from Hu County, Shaanxi Province, donated 100 jin of cotton; Liu Shuanfeng, another farmer from the county, not only donated cotton, but also specially altered the lined clothes he wanted to donate into cotton-padded clothes. Commanders and combatants of a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army also donated 670 pieces of winter clothing and more than 8 million yuan in cash. A cadre from the Water Conservancy Bureau of Siping City, Northeast China, donated all of his 10 million yuan in work bonuses. Zhao Zhao-shi, a resident of Zhianli in Tianjin, donated 48 pieces of clothing that she had accumulated over the years.

　　寒衣赈灾运动胜利结束
　  各地重灾民均已得到棉衣
    【新华社讯】为皖北、苏北、河南、河北灾民劝募寒衣的运动已告结束，全国各地、各大城市共募得寒衣（包括寒衣代金）五百二十四万多套，和布匹、棉花、鞋袜、帽子一部。这些寒衣随收随发，去冬就已分发给了上述四个地区的灾民。其中皖北区分得最多，计三百一十四万七千多套。各地区的重灾民都得到了棉衣。
    去年九月，首都寒衣劝募总会和各地分会相继成立，为淮河水灾区和河北永定河水灾区的灾胞劝募寒衣。各地同胞热烈捐输，很快就形成了全国性的寒衣赈灾运动，充分发挥了我国人民的团结互助精神。截至十一月，仅两个月的时间，全国就募得了寒衣（包括代金）五百多万套，又一次证明：我国人民伟大的团结力量，能够战胜一切灾害和困难。
    劝募中，各地各界人士都有许多关怀灾胞，踊跃捐助的生动事例。中央人民政府铁道部两千多职工，就捐出了寒衣七千三百多件和代金七百多万元。东北鞍山市各工厂工友，普遍捐出了一天到五天的工资。陕西省鄠县农民于成怀捐了棉花一百斤；该县另一农民刘拴凤不但捐了棉花，还把要捐的夹衣特地改做成了棉衣。人民解放军某兵团的指挥员和战斗员，也捐出了寒衣六百七十件和代金八百多万元。东北四平市水利局某干部把所得工作奖金一千万元全部捐了。天津市致安里居民赵赵氏，捐出了她多年积存的四十八件衣服。
