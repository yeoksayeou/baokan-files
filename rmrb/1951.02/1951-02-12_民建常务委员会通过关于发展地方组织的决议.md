　　The China Democratic National Construction Association Standing Committee Passes Resolution on Developing Local Organizations
    [From Our Newspaper] The China Democratic National Construction Association passed a resolution on the development of local organizations at a meeting of the Standing Committee held on January 30. The abstract is as follows:
    All local organizations should steadily strive for development on a consolidated foundation; at the same time, they should strive to consolidate the organization in the process of development.
    The focus of this association on "absorbing members" should still be "on national industrialists and businessmen." In the future, in addition to continuing to strive for the participation of representative progressive figures in the industrial and commercial circles, special efforts must also be made to attract the vast number of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to join the association to enrich the mass base of the association; at the same time, we must continue to strive for the participation of progressive intellectuals who are willing to fight for the realization of the association's tasks, so as to facilitate the development of work.
    In the future, the development of members should focus on activists in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and various mass patriotic movements in the industrial and commercial circles. For example, those who actively implement the patriotic covenant and take the lead in the current movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea should become the main target of our membership development.
    All local organizations should strive to expand the democratic foundation, cultivate democratic spirit and democratic style, develop the habit of "relying on the masses of members" to carry out work and movements, so that this association can truly become an organization of all members.

　　民建常务委员会通过关于发展地方组织的决议
    【本报讯】民主建国会于一月三十日举行的常务委员会会议上通过该会关于发展地方组织的决议，摘要如下：
    各地方组织应在巩固的基础上稳步争取发展；同时应在发展的过程中力求巩固组织。
    本会“吸收会员的重点”仍应“放在民族工商业者的身上”。今后除应继续争取工商业界有代表性的进步人物入会外，还须特别努力争取广大的中小工商业者入会，以充实本会的群众基础；同时仍须努力争取愿为实现本会任务而奋斗的进步知识分子入会，以便于开展工作。
    今后发展会员，应特别着重工商联、同业公会及工商业界的各种群众爱国运动中的积极分子。如目前抗美援朝运动中积极执行爱国公约并起带头作用的分子，应成为我们发展会员的主要对象。
    各地方组织均应努力扩大民主基础，培养民主精神和民主作风，养成“依靠会员群众”开展工作和运动，使本会真正成为全体会员的组织。
