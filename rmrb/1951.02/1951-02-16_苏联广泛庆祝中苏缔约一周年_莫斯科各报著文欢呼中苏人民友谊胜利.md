These principles, which are completely opposed to the predatory foreign policy of capitalist countries, permeate every word of the Sino-Soviet Treaty.

This friendship means that seven hundred million people in China and the Soviet Union have united in an invincible camp.

In his article, Mikheyev emphasized that the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong foundation for peace in the Far East and a bridge linking revolutionary Europe with revolutionary Asia. It encourages peace fighters around the world to intensify their struggle against the camp of warmongers and unfolds a bright prospect.
