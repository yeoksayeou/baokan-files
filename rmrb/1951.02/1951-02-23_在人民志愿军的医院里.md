　　In the Hospital of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
　　Bai Hua
　　Entrusted by the people, we spent twenty days traveling thousands of miles to express our regards to the heroic and wounded commanders and fighters in various hospitals of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　The people's heroes gave me two extremely strong impressions: they bore all the hardships and sufferings, even shedding blood, for the safety of the motherland and the happiness of the people; although they suffered physical injuries, they still possessed vigorous spirits and iron will. They seemed to be on the eve of battle, not in a hospital. They spoke eloquently and excitedly about the moving and legendary stories of the joint operations of the Chinese and Korean troops, and the ugly spectacle of the American imperialist aggressors running away with their heads in their hands or surrendering in a panic at the sound of our hand grenades. Sometimes they even performed a bit, which made everyone laugh.

　　The news from the Korean front was their greatest concern. Although the warriors were recuperating, they still thought of everything on the front lines. They said, "Life on the front lines is much harder than ours. In comparison, life in the rear is too good. The Korean people have been devastated by the American imperialists and are living a very hard life!"

　　The slogan "Be a model in combat at the front, and a model in recuperation in the rear" was put forward by themselves. The wounded and sick in various hospitals, collectively or individually, wrote letters of determination to recuperate with peace of mind. They knew that only by recuperating with peace of mind and striving to regain their health as soon as possible could they return to the battlefield and avenge their enemies. The entire team of the third and fifth squads of a certain hospital wrote in their letter of determination: First, recuperate with peace of mind and obey the doctor's instructions. After recovering, return to the front lines immediately. Second, do not forget to study during recuperation, run the wall newspaper well, and eliminate illiteracy. Third, unite and help each other during recuperation.

　　They have their own study groups, newspaper reading groups, and wall newspapers. On each person's bed or desk, there are some pictorials or literary series. Jiang Liansheng and Zhao Huchen have learned two hundred new characters in less than a month since being admitted to the hospital; some have even learned Korean. The blackboard newspaper is a good tool for promoting learning and carrying out criticism; the submissions are often very crowded. They also put paintings and books in the consolation bags and circulate them from bed to bed for the seriously injured comrades to read. They regard the recuperation period as a valuable learning opportunity and regard living in the hospital as living in a school.

　　All the medical staff have developed a high degree of revolutionary humanitarianism, doing everything possible to help the wounded recover their health as soon as possible. Their work is very intense, with an average of sixty to eighty wounded soldiers cared for by each doctor; and twenty to thirty wounded soldiers cared for by each nurse or caregiver. In the face of this arduous task, they demonstrated a spirit of selfless work. At one point, 80% of the staff in the first team of a certain hospital had a cold. But no one rested. Most of the nursing team in a certain hospital were female comrades. Some of them fainted due to overwork. Li Mingtong, a trainee doctor at the hospital, fainted outside the ward at night and was only discovered by a wounded soldier who got up to relieve himself. Liu Jingye took care of 53 people, and in three weeks, she bathed each person four times and created a method of using hot bricks instead of hot water bags for hot compress. Dressing attendant Wang Yinghua and others often worked until late at night washing utensils and appliances, their hands were cracked, and even bleeding.

　　The diligent and enthusiastic nursing treatment of the hospital staff moved every wounded and sick soldier. All the wounded soldiers in the fifth team of a certain hospital sent the nurses the words "Maternal Care"; the fourth team sent a banner with the words "Model of Loving the Wounded" to all the staff.

　　The lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism of the heroes is respected and loved by the vast people. The masses in each hospital's location, whenever the wounded arrive, are busy tidying up the houses, repairing the stoves, and cooperating with the hospital to set up beds. When the wounded arrive, the staff and masses of local organizations and groups personally carry stretchers and bring gifts of various colors to welcome them. When the wounded enter the warm ward, the dirty clothes they take off are immediately taken away to be dismantled and washed. The people send all kinds of daily necessities and a large amount of food. Volunteer blood donation teams pour in, vying to be the first to donate their blood to save the people's heroes. A team of forty-seven people once donated more than four thousand cc of blood, saving the lives of more than thirty seriously wounded soldiers.

　　Women, even more like loving mothers, in the severe cold weather, dismantled, washed, and made thousands upon thousands of pieces of clothing and bedding for the wounded soldiers. The women in the location of a certain hospital automatically organized a laundry team. They competed with each other to see who washed the cleanest and the most. The team successively dismantled and washed more than 8,000 pieces of cotton clothing, more than 1,500 pieces of single clothing, more than 2,000 pieces of underwear and quilts, and made more than 4,400 pieces of single clothing.

　　在人民志愿军的医院里
    白桦
    我们受了人民的嘱托，以二十天的时间，走了数千里路，向各个中国人民志愿军医院英勇负伤的指战员们进行了慰问。
    人民的英雄给了我两个极其强烈的感觉：他们为了祖国的安全，为了人民的幸福，承担了一切的艰难困苦，甚至流了鲜血；他们虽然肉体上遭受到伤害，却仍有着健旺的精神和钢铁的意志。他们像是在战斗的前夕，而不是在医院里。他们侃侃而谈，兴奋地讲述着中朝部队并肩作战的各种可歌可泣的神话般的故事，讲述着美帝侵略军听到我们的手榴弹一响，就抱头鼠窜或狼狈缴枪的丑态。他们有时还表演一下，引得大家大笑。
    朝鲜前线的战讯，是他们最关心的事。勇士们虽在休养，仍遥念着前线的一切。他们说：“前线生活比我们苦得多。比较起来，后方的生活太好了。朝鲜人民被美帝国主义者糟蹋得很厉害，生活很苦！”
    “在前方做战斗模范，在后方做休养模范”的口号，是他们自己提出来的。各院的伤病员，集体或个人都写下了安心休养的决心书。他们知道：只有安心休养，争取早日恢复健康，才能重返战场，杀敌复仇。某院三、五队全体休养员在决心书上写着：第一，安心休养，听从医生吩咐。痊愈之后，立即重上前线。第二，休养不忘学习，办好墙报，消灭文盲。第三，休养期间，互相团结，互相帮助。
    他们有自己的学习小组、读报组和墙报。每人的床上或桌上，都有一些画报或文艺丛书。蒋连升，赵虎臣入院未及一月，已学会二百生字；有人还学习了朝鲜文。黑板报是推动学习、开展批评的良好工具；稿件经常都很拥挤。他们并在慰问袋里装入画、书，给重伤同志们挨床传阅。他们把休养期间，看成宝贵的学习机会，把住医院当作住学校。
    所有的医务工作人员，都发扬了高度的革命的人道主义精神，尽一切努力使伤员早日恢复健康。他们的工作非常紧张，平均每个医生要照顾六十到八十个伤员；每个护士、照顾员要护理二十到三十个伤员。在这个严重的任务面前，他们表现了忘我的工作精神。某院一队曾有一个时期有百分之八十的工作人员患了感冒。但没有一个人休息。某院的看护队，大部为女同志，因为过度疲劳，有些人曾昏倒过去。该院见习医生李明童，夜间昏倒于病室之外，伤员起来解手才发现了他。刘静业护理了五十三个人，在三周内还为每人擦澡四次，并创造用热砖代替热水袋进行热敷的办法。敷料员王英华等，洗刷器皿用具等常工作到深夜，手都破裂了，甚至流了血。
    医院人员辛勤热情的护理治疗，感动了每个伤病员。某院五队全体伤员给护士送了“慈母看护”四个字；四队给全体工作人员送了“爱伤模范”的锦旗。
    英雄们的爱国主义与国际主义的崇高精神，受到广大人民的无比尊敬和热爱。每个医院驻地的群众，每当伤员到达之前，都忙着整理屋子，修火炉，协同院方安置床铺。伤员到达时，当地机关团体的工作人员、群众，都亲自抬着担架，拿着各色的礼物，迎接上来。当伤员进入温暖的病室后，换下的脏衣，立即被拿去拆洗。人民送来各种日用品和大量食品。自愿献血队涌进来，纷纷要求第一个输出自己的鲜血，救治人民的英雄。某队四十七人一次献出鲜血四千余西西，挽救了三十多名重伤战士的生命。
    妇女们，更像慈母一样，在严寒天气中，为伤员们拆洗和做了成千成万件的衣被。某院驻地的妇女，自动组织了洗衣队。她们互相比赛，看谁洗得干净，洗得多。该队先后共拆洗棉衣八千余件，单衣一千五百余件，线衣、棉被二千余件，做好单衣四千四百余件。
