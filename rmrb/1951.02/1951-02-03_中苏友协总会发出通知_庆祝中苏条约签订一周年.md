Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd:

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, in order to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino- Soviet Treaty Of Friendship,Alliance,and Mutual Assistence, hereby issues the following notice to all levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations:

February 14th is the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty Of Friendship,Alliance,and Mutual Assistence and agreements. The Headquarters has decided that Friendship Associations at all levels will hold celebrations at that time and carry out large-scale and in-depth propaganda work, develop membership, and expand the organization of Friendship Associations. The methods are as follows:

I. Each level of Friendship Association should formulate specific methods according to local conditions, and utilize possible conditions to carry out extensive and in-depth celebration and propaganda work through various means such as celebration meetings, lectures, films, photo exhibitions, wall newspapers, etc., and cooperate with relevant groups and units. If possible, a celebration and propaganda week can be held. These celebration activities should be combined with the local movement to Resist America and Aid Korea; and before hand, information should be collected on the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship issues in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, and profound explanations should be carried out simultaneously in response to these situations.

II. The content of the propaganda should focus on the following two points:

	1. Explain the great significance and great contribution of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty to consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship and defending world peace, and explain that the strength of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance is invincible in the world, and any imperialist aggression and adventures will inevitably be crushed and defeated, in order to further strengthen confidence and strength in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and defend world peace.

	2. In connection with past history, emphasize the Soviet Union's friendly assistance to us since the signing of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty one year ago and before the signing of the New Treaty, and explain the role and effect of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty in our actual assistance (it is best to connect it to some specific examples of friendship, such as how the Soviet Union inventoried and handed over the original Japanese property in Dalian to our country, and how the Soviet representatives sponsored our struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea in the United Nations, especially what was experienced or familiar locally), and use these specific examples to guide the masses to fundamentally understand the socialist nature of the Soviet state, systematically and specifically explain some issues about the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet relations among the masses, and further develop and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship.

Localities can formulate specific propaganda content based on the above propaganda focus, referring to the propaganda materials already mailed to you.

III. In this large-scale celebration and propaganda work, Friendship Associations in various places should seize the opportunity to greatly expand the influence of the Friendship Association, and follow the instructions and methods of the National Working Conference to develop a large number of group members and individual members, and expand the organization of the Friendship Association (especially in areas with very few members), in order to complete the task of developing the National Friendship Association to 20 million members this year.

IV. Friendship Associations in major administrative regions, provinces, and large cities should first report the simple activity situation to the Headquarters within one week after the end of the work, and then summarize the work as soon as possible and send it to the Headquarters. (If Friendship Associations below the provincial level have comprehensive and better reports and summaries, a copy can be sent to the Headquarters).

　　中苏友协总会发出通知
    庆祝中苏条约签订一周年
    【新华社二日讯】中苏友好协会总会为庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年，特向各级中苏友好协会发出通知如下：
    二月十四日为中苏友好同盟互助条约及协定签订周年纪念，总会决定各级友协届时举行庆祝并大规模深入地展开宣传工作，发展会员，扩大友协组织。办法如下：
    一、由各级友协按照当地情况规定具体办法、应利用可能条件，通过庆祝会、讲演会、电影、图片展览、墙报等各种方式，并与有关团体单位配合，广泛深入地展开庆祝宣传工作，可能时可举办庆祝宣传周。这些庆祝活动应与当地的抗美援朝运动结合起来；并应在事先收集群众在抗美援朝运动中对苏联对中苏友好问题的认识情况，针对这些情况同时进行深刻的解释。
    二、宣传内容着重以下两点：
    １、说明中苏新约对巩固中苏友好及保卫世界和平的重大意义及其伟大的贡献，说明中苏两国结成友好同盟的力量无敌于天下、任何帝国主义的侵略冒险必然被粉碎和击败，以进一步加强在抗美援朝和保卫世界和平运动中的信心和力量。
    ２、联系过去历史，着重说明中苏新约签订一年以来和新约签订以前，苏联对我们友谊的帮助，说明中苏新约对我们实际帮助所起的作用及效果（最好联系到一些具体的友谊事例，如苏联如何将大连的原来日本财产清点交给我国，苏联代表在联合国中赞助我抗美援朝的斗争，特别是当地所经历或熟悉的），并以这些具体事例引导群众从基本上认识苏联国家的社会主义性质，有系统地具体地解释群众中关于苏联和中苏关系的一些问题，进一步发展中苏友好，巩固中苏友好。
    各地可依据上述的宣传重点，参照已经邮寄给你们的宣传资料，拟定具体的宣传内容。
    三、各地友协要在这一大规模的庆祝宣传工作中，抓紧时机，很好地扩大友协的影响，按照全国工作会议的指示办法，大量发展团体会员及个人会员，扩大友协的组织（特别是会员很少的地区），以完成全国友协在本年内发展至两千万会员的任务。
    四、各大行政区、省、大市友协应于工作结束后一周内，将简单活动情况先行报告总会，并尽速总结这一工作随后寄发总会。（省以下各级友协如有全面及较好的报导及总结，可将副本寄来总会一份）。
