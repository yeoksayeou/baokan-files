Striving to Fulfill This Year's Publishing Tasks
The Editor

	The outline of the 1951 publishing work plan has been formulated by the General Publishing Administration and revised and approved for implementation by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council. This plan outline stipulates the general guidelines for the national publishing work this year, and also stipulates the specific guidelines for publishing, distribution, and printing work. All publishing workers in the country should strive to fulfill the tasks stipulated in this plan outline. All publishing workers in the country should formulate or revise their work plans according to the spirit of this plan outline and in accordance with their professional directions.

	The work outline first points out that this year is a decisive year for realizing the professional division of labor in the national publishing industry and overcoming the phenomena of disorganization and lack of planning. Before liberation, the Chinese publishing industry was unorganized, unplanned, and without leadership. Everyone acted on their own, engaging in blind competition. The Kuomintang reactionary rulers only knew how to do their utmost to destroy and oppress the publishing industry that was beneficial to the people. After liberation, especially after the First National Publishing Conference in September last year, this situation has undergone a fundamental change. After the National Publishing Conference, the state-owned publishing institutions first carried out professional division of labor. Xinhua Bookstore, the largest state-owned publishing enterprise in the country, has been divided into three aspects: publishing, distribution, and printing. After the division of labor, Xinhua Bookstore no longer engages in the operation of publishing and printing, but divides its publishing part to expand into the People's Publishing House, which mainly publishes political and theoretical books; and divides its printing part to establish the Xinhua Printing Plant General Administration. The two joint state-private textbook publishing institutions, North China United Publishing House and Shanghai United Publishing House, were also reorganized and expanded into the People's Education Publishing House at the same time. Literature Publishing House and Fine Arts Publishing House are also actively preparing. After two months of deliberation and research, the five largest joint state-private and private publishing institutions in the country, Sanlian, Zhonghua, Commercial Press, Kaiming, and Lianying, also divided their distribution parts to form the joint state-private China Book Distribution Company, and each carried out professional division of labor in their publishing parts. Other publishing houses such as Youth Publishing House and Workers' Publishing House are also developing according to their professional directions. On this basis, through the efforts of 1951 and strengthening organized leadership, the national publishing industry will gradually move towards planning and gradually eliminate unorganized phenomena.

	In the plan outline, the publishing and distribution work is stipulated from the aspects of principles and specific tasks. In terms of principles, it is stipulated that "all publishing and distribution work should take the expansion of patriotic and internationalist, anti-imperialist and anti-aggression propaganda and education as the central political task. At present, we should especially strengthen the propaganda against American aggression and in defense of world peace, and combine it with the actual needs of national defense economic construction." At the First National Publishing Conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De instructed us: "Publishing is an important weapon for educating the masses, organizing and promoting work." We must be good at mastering this weapon and strive to realize the current political tasks.

	In order to realize this principle, the plan outline stipulates that a large number of popular reading materials, current affairs handbooks, various pictures, albums, comic strips, and pictorials should be published to promote patriotism, internationalism, and anti-imperialist and anti-aggression ideas. Although some of these kinds of reading materials have been published in the past, both the quantity and quality are not enough. In particular, there are even fewer publications that are planned and printed according to specific objects. Our popular reading materials and current affairs reading materials are mostly general, and more suitable for general urban readers and cadres, and very few are suitable for workers and peasants with low cultural levels. Most of the current series and single books on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and patriotism are of an intermediate level, and very few are really suitable for workers and peasants to read. How to improve the quantity and quality of such publications and implement professional division of labor according to the target readers is a serious issue for the publishing industry at present.

	In order to strengthen the propaganda and education of patriotism, the plan outline stipulates that historical and geographical works of our country, modern scientific works of our country, classical literary works of our country, and literary works since the May Fourth Movement should be compiled and published in a planned way. The compilation and publication of these works will increase our understanding of the great motherland and will be sufficient to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence. The compilation and publication of these works will make us more aware of the creative spirit of our nation and will be sufficient to inspire our enthusiasm for construction. The compilation of historical materials, classical literary works, and literary works since the "May Fourth" of our country has begun last year and will be published successively soon. The compilation of geographical data of our country and modern scientific works of our country remains to be planned and organized specifically.

	In order to improve our theoretical level and political level, we must strengthen the propaganda and education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" will be an epoch-making event in the Chinese publishing industry. After the publication of this great collection of articles, a new upsurge of theoretical study will be created in China: it will greatly improve our theoretical understanding and will greatly promote the realization of our various construction tasks. Of course, in order to strengthen the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, the publication of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the continued compilation and publication of various popular explanatory versions of Marxism-Leninism and political study books are also absolutely necessary.

	In the cultural and economic construction of New China, the translation of academic masterpieces and scientific masterpieces is urgently needed. Although the translation community has done some of this work in the past, it was carried out in an unorganized and unplanned manner and under extremely difficult political or material conditions, so not only the quality and quantity were insufficient, but also there were some phenomena of duplication and waste. It is necessary to organize national translation talents and carry out this work in a planned way as proposed in the plan outline. In order to realize this task and overcome the current phenomenon of duplication and waste in the translation community, a national translation work conference will be held this year to study the plan and distribute the forces. This is an unprecedented event in the translation work of our country.

	The current textbooks used in primary and secondary schools have some problems in terms of content and supply. The plan outline instructs the People's Education Publishing House to start re-compiling them this year and establish a national unified supply base. This is an extremely important task in education construction.

	The distribution work must cooperate with the publishing work to promote the publications that are beneficial to the readers and urgently needed by the readers to the readers in a planned and timely manner. To this end, the plan outline points out that Xinhua Bookstore must form a national distribution network with the China Book Distribution Company and the national medium and small distribution institutions; to this end, the plan outline points out that various forms of distribution stations should be gradually established in rural areas, factories, troops, organs, and schools to organize readers and promote the reading movement; to this end, the plan outline points out to improve the distribution of textbooks for primary and secondary schools so that students across the country can universally and timely obtain the textbooks they need. In order to organize and promote cadre study and take care of the supply of cadres and organized workers, peasants and soldiers, the General Publishing Administration has also allocated a part of the funds for Xinhua Bookstore to order 77,420 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a large number of popular reading materials. These works need to be done well by the national distribution workers.

	This publishing work plan outline has laid out a path of development for the national publishing workers. All publishing workers in the country, let us strive to complete our glorious political tasks!

　　为完成今年出版任务而奋斗
　　编者
    一九五一年的出版工作计划大纲，业经出版总署制订、政务院文教委员会修正批准施行。这个计划大纲规定了今年全国出版工作的总方针，也规定了出版、发行、印刷工作的具体方针。全国出版工作者，应一致为完成这个计划大纲中所规定的任务而奋斗。全国出版工作者，应根据这个计划大纲的精神，按照自己的专业方向，制定或修正自己的工作计划。
    工作大纲中首先指出，今年是实现全国出版事业专业分工，克服无组织无计划现象具有决定性的一年。解放以前的中国出版界，是没有组织、没有计划、没有领导的。大家各自为政，进行盲目的竞争。国民党反动统治者，只会对有利于人民的出版事业极尽其摧残压迫之能事。解放以后，特别是去年九月第一届全国出版会议以后，这种情况已经有了根本的改变。全国出版会议以后，公营出版机构首先进行了专业分工，全国最大的公营出版企业新华书店已经按照出版、发行、印刷三个方面进行了分工。分工以后，新华书店已不再从事出版与印刷的经营，而把它的出版部分划分出来扩充成以出版政治与理论书籍为主要任务的人民出版社；把它的印刷部分划分出来，建立了新华印刷厂总管理处。公私合营的两个教科书出版机构华北联合出版社与上海联合出版社，也在同时改组扩展为人民教育出版社。文学出版社与美术出版社，也在积极筹备中。三联、中华、商务、开明、联营等五个全国最大的公私合营与私营出版机构，在经过两个月的酝酿研究之后，也各自把发行部分划分出来，合组成公私合营的中国图书发行公司，并且各自将出版部分进行了专业分工。其他如青年出版社与工人出版社也都按照着它们的专业方向发展。在这个基础之上，经过一九五一年的努力，加强有组织的领导，全国出版事业一定能逐步走向计划化，逐步消灭无组织的现象。
    计划大纲中，对于出版与发行工作从方针上与具体任务上都作了规定。在方针上，规定“一切出版、发行工作应以扩大爱国主义、国际主义的，反帝、反侵略的宣传教育为中心政治任务。在目前，尤应加强反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平的宣传，并与国家的国防经济建设的实际需要相结合。”在第一届全国出版会议上，朱德总司令曾指示我们：“出版是教育群众，组织和推动工作的一个重要武器。”我们必须善于掌握这个武器，为实现当前的政治任务而奋斗。
    为实现这个方针，计划大纲中规定大量出版宣传爱国主义、国际主义和反帝反侵略的通俗读物、时事手册、各种图片、画册、连环图画和画报。这一类的读物，过去虽然出版了一些，但是无论在数量与质量上都是不够的。特别是按照特定对象有计划编印的出版物就更少。我们的通俗读物与时事读物，大都是一般性的，适合于城市一般读者及干部的较多，适合于文化水平低的工人与农民的很少见到。目前出版的有关抗美援朝、爱国主义的丛书与单册，大都是中级水平的，真正适合工农阅读的也很少。如何提高这类出版物的数量与质量，按照读者对象来实行专业分工，是目前出版界的一个严重的课题。
    为加强爱国主义的宣传教育，计划大纲中规定有计划地编刊我国历史地理著作、我国近代科学著作、我国古典文学作品和五四以来的文学作品。这些著作的编刊，将增加我们对伟大祖国的认识，足以提高民族的自尊心与自信心。这些著作的编刊，将使我们更加认识我们民族的创造精神，足以激发我们的建设热忱。我国历史资料、古典文学作品与“五四”以来文学作品的编选，从去年已经开始了，不久将陆续出版。我国地理资料与我国近代科学著作的编刊，尚待作具体的计划与组织。
    为了提高我们的理论水平与政治水平，必须加强马列主义与毛泽东思想的宣传教育。《毛泽东选集》的出版，将是中国出版界划时代的大事。这套伟大文集出版以后，将在中国造成一个理论学习的新高潮：将要大大提高我们的理论认识，将会大大推动我们的各项建设任务的实现。当然，为了加强马列主义的宣传，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作的出版，马列主义各种通俗解释本与政治学习用书的继续编刊，也是绝对必要的。
    在新中国的文化建设与经济建设中，迫切需要学术名著与科学名著的翻译。这种工作，过去翻译界虽曾做过一些，但那是在无组织无计划的情况下，在政治条件或物质条件异常困难的情况下进行的，因而不只在质量与数量方面都很不够，而且有一些重复浪费的现象。计划大纲中提出组织全国翻译人材，有计划地来做这项工作是很必要的。为了实现这个任务及克服目前翻译界存在着的重复浪费现象，今年将召开一个全国翻译工作会议，研究方案，分配力量。这在我国翻译工作上是一件破天荒的大事。
    目前采用的中小学课本，在内容与供应上都有一些问题，计划大纲中责成人民教育出版社在本年内着手重编，并建立全国统一供应的基础，这在教育建设上是一项极端重要的工作。
    发行工作必须配合出版工作，将有益于读者的和读者所迫切需要的出版物有计划地、及时地推行到读者中去。为此，计划大纲中指出新华书店必须与中国图书发行公司和全国的中小发行机构，构成全国的发行网；为此，计划大纲中指出在农村、工厂、部队、机关、学校中逐渐建立各种形式的发行站，组织读者，推进读书运动；为此，计划大纲中指出改善中小学课本的发行工作，使全国学生普遍地及时地获得所需要的课本。为了组织和推动干部学习，照顾供给制干部及有组织的工农兵读者，出版总署并拨出一部分经费，由新华书店定印《毛泽东选集》七七、四二○部和大批通俗读物。这些工作是需要全国的发行工作者努力做好的。
    这个出版工作计划大纲，给全国的出版工作者规划了一个发展的道路。全国的出版工作者，为完成我们的光荣的政治任务而奋斗吧！
