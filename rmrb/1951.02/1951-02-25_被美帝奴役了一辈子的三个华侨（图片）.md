Three Overseas Chinese Enslaved by American Imperialism for a Lifetime (Sketch) by Situ Qiao
(Note) These are three overseas Chinese who were enslaved by American imperialists for their entire lives. In 1897, American capitalists used deception to transport six hundred Cantonese people to Kauai Island in Hawaii for land reclamation. The three people in the picture, Li Donghao, Tang Xinhai, and Zheng Jinlu, are among the only few of that group who were recently able to return to their motherland. They were enslaved on that desolate island for a full fifty-three years, until they were deaf, blind, bloodless, and exhausted, unable to even hold a hoe, before they were discarded like rags! When they returned to China, they only had forty-eight US dollars in their pockets, which was a relief fund raised by local overseas Chinese organizations.

Once the six hundred people set foot on the desolate island overgrown with thorny bushes, they lost contact with the outside world. Day and night, year after year, they reclaimed land, planted sugarcane, pineapples, and rice under the whips of their American "masters." After the capitalists made their fortunes, they sold the reclaimed land to another group of capitalists and returned to the American mainland to enjoy themselves. In this way, they were replaced eleven times in several decades, and each new "master" intensified the cruel exploitation of these workers. They fell ill, died, and lived a hellish life, with no chance of escape under the guard of gunmen on the steamships. Each person's annual salary was always ten US dollars. But these few dollars all flowed into the American-owned general stores that sold tobacco and alcohol.

By 1950, only nine elderly people in their seventies and eighties who could no longer work remained of the six hundred people on this reclaimed land. At this time, the Americans notified the Chinese Association of Hawaii, who then raised a few ship tickets from overseas Chinese charitable organizations and sent away the three oldest among them.

Only after they boarded the ship did they hear the news of the liberation of the people of their motherland for the first time from the returning students on the same ship. While expressing their excitement and joy to the fellow overseas Chinese on the ship, they angrily recounted the crimes of American imperialists in cruelly exploiting overseas Chinese. The artist Mr. Situ Qiao was also on the ship at the time and drew portraits of these three overseas Chinese compatriots. From this painting, we can see the extent of the cruelty of American imperialism in enslaving our overseas Chinese compatriots, and at the same time, we can see the firm and unyielding character of our working people and their angry and contemptuous expressions towards the enemy.

    被美帝奴役了一辈子的三个华侨（素描）  司徒乔作
    （说明）这是被美帝国主义者奴役了一辈子的三个华侨。一八九七年，美国资本家用拐骗方式把六百个广东人运载到夏威夷的高威岛去开垦。图中三人李东号、汤心海、郑进禄就是那一行人中能够最近回到祖国来的仅有的几个。他们在那荒岛上被奴役了整整五十三年，直到耳聋眼瞎，血枯力尽，连锄头都拿不动，才像几块破布似地被扔掉！回国时他们口袋里只有美金四十八元，还是当地华侨团体代募得的赈款。
    六百人一踏上荆榛丛生的荒岛后，就和外界断绝了关系。他们夜以继日，年复一年，在美国“主人”的皮鞭下垦荒，种植甘蔗、菠萝、稻子。资本家发了财之后就把垦地卖给另一批资本家，自己回到美国本土去享福。这样在几十年内一共换了十一批，每一批新的“主人”到来，更加强了对这些工人的严酷榨取。他们病的病，死的死，过着地狱般的生活，在汽船上的枪手的警戒下，连逃命的机会也没有。每人的年薪永远是美金十元。但这几元钱还是全数流入了美国人为他们所设的贩卖烟酒的杂物店里去。
  到一九五○年，这垦地上的六百人只剩了九个七八十岁的再也不能劳动的老者。这时美国人才通知夏威夷中华会馆，再由中华会馆向华侨慈善机关募得几张船票，把其中最老的三个送走。
  他们到了船上，才从同船的归国留学生口中，第一次听到了祖国人民翻身的消息。他们一面向同船侨胞表示他们的兴奋欢喜，一面愤怒地诉述了美帝国主义者怎样残酷榨取华侨的罪恶故事。画家司徒乔先生当时也在船上，就给这三位侨胞画了像。从这幅画中我们可以看到美帝国主义奴役我侨胞的残酷的程度，同时也可以看出我国劳动人民的坚强不屈的性格和对敌人的愤怒与鄙视的神情。
