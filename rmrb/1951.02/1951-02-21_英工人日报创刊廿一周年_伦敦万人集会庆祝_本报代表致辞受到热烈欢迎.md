　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 20th: London dispatch: On the evening of the 18th, a grand rally attended by ten thousand people was held in London to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the founding of the "Daily Worker."
    British Communist Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: What is happening in Korea is a stain on history. The miraculous democratic construction achieved by the Korean people is now being destroyed by the brutal attacks of the American aggressors. However, no tool of destruction can ever defeat the Korean people, the Malayan people, or other Asian people in their struggle for freedom. Pollitt contrasted the heroic, unconquerable struggle waged by these people with the British ruling class's degradation of Britain to a vassal state under American command. He demanded the establishment of a true British people's government based on the people's democratic system outlined in the recently published program of the British Communist Party.
    Wu Wentao, the representative of the Beijing "People's Daily," was warmly welcomed by the conference. When he delivered his congratulatory message, his words were frequently interrupted by applause. As he concluded his congratulatory speech, all attendees rose and responded with thunderous applause. The chairman of the conference, "Daily Worker" Deputy Editor-in-Chief Gollan, asked him to solemnly convey greetings to the Chinese people, expressing "under no circumstances or at any time are the British people determined to fight against the Chinese people."
    The conference also held an exhibition on the "Daily Worker's" 21 years of struggle.

　　英工人日报创刊廿一周年
    伦敦万人集会庆祝
    本报代表致辞受到热烈欢迎
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】伦敦讯：十八日晚，伦敦举行了万人参加的盛大集会，庆祝工人日报创刊二十一周年。
    英国共产党总书记波立特在会上发表演说称：在朝鲜所发生的事情，乃是历史上的一个污渍。朝鲜人民所完成的奇迹似的民主建设，现在都被美国侵略者残酷的进攻所摧毁了。然而，一切破坏的工具都永远不能击败朝鲜人民、马来亚人民或其他亚洲人民争取自由的斗争。波立特把这些人民所进行的英勇的不可征服的斗争，与英国统治阶级使英国堕落到美国指挥下的附庸地位作了一个对比。他要求根据英共最近发表的纲领中所规划的人民民主制度来建立一个真正的英国人民的政府。
    北京人民日报代表吴文焘受到大会的热烈欢迎。当他致贺辞时，他的话频频为掌声所打断。在他结束他的祝辞时，全体与会者起立报以雷动的掌声。大会主席工人日报副主笔高兰请他向中国人民郑重致意，表示“在任何情况下或任何时候，英国人民都决心不与中国人民作战”。
    大会并举行了工人日报二十一年斗争展览会。
