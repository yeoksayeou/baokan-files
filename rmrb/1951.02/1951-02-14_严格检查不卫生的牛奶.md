　　Strictly Inspect Unhygienic Milk
    The Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School, affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, has a dairy farming department that sells milk to city residents for consumption. Among the dozens of dairy cows they raise, several have been found to be suffering from infectious diseases. These cows are emaciated, their ribs protrude, they cough constantly, and one has already died. Once, when a Soviet expert came to visit, he could tell with the naked eye that some of the cows had tuberculosis. Later, after inspection by the dairy farming department, it was confirmed that they were indeed suffering from tuberculosis. However, the farm does not properly handle these sick cows, and continues to sell milk containing tuberculosis bacteria to hospitals, nurseries, and city residents for consumption. Although this milk is boiled before consumption, it cannot be absolutely sterilized. The person in charge of the farm clearly knows this situation, but he still allows the sick cows to live with the healthy cows, and mixes the milk with tuberculosis bacteria with the good milk, making it possible for everyone who drinks the milk to be infected. I hope that the farm will quickly correct this behavior that harms the health of the masses; and I hope that the health department will seriously inspect all public and private dairy farms, correct similar phenomena, and protect the health of the people.

　　严格检查不卫生的牛奶
    农业部所属双桥机耕学校的附属农场设有养牛部门，所产牛奶，出售给市民食用。在他们喂养的数十头奶牛中，已发现有若干头害着传染病。这些牛身体消瘦，肋骨突出，不断咳嗽，有一头已病死。有一次苏联专家来参观，他凭肉眼就看出有些牛有结核症。后来经养牛部门进行检查，确系害结核症。但该农场对这些病牛不加以妥善处理，仍把带有结核病菌的牛奶出售给医院、托儿所及市民食用。这些牛奶在吃用时虽经过煮沸，但并不能绝对消毒。该农场负责人明明知道这种情形，可是他依旧让有病的牛和健康的牛住在一起，让有结核菌的牛奶和好的牛奶搅在一起，使每一个吃奶的人都有可能受传染。我希望该农场迅速纠正这种损害群众健康的行为；并希望卫生部门认真检查所有的公私立牛奶场，纠正类似现象，以保护人民的健康。
