　　The Importance of Mass Reproduction of Cartoons
    Gao Meng
    In the Southern Jiangsu area, a mass propaganda method and artistic activity has emerged: taking cartoons from newspapers and magazines, enlarging them to resemble the originals, coloring them, and posting them at the entrances of factories, schools, government offices, people's cultural centers, or on wall newspapers, or on the streets. I think other regions will have similar situations. These cartoons are mostly well-drawn, not distorted, and since they are enlarged and colored, the colors are bright, making them more attractive than the original drawings. Because they are closely integrated with reality, they can fully play a propaganda role in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. Cartoons such as "Don't Listen to the Voice of America," "American Devils in Korea Being Beaten to a Pulp by the Chinese and Korean People's Army," "Atrocities of the American-Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents," and "Evil Tricks of Unlawful Landlords" are all very popular among the masses; even more people watch serialized cartoons such as "A History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China."
    Recently, I saw a suggestion in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily that the cartoon reproduction movement should be extended to shop windows. In a corner of the window, with the principle of not hindering the display of goods, patriotic shop owners and employees should be encouraged to display cartoon reproductions. Larger stores can transform flat cartoons into three-dimensional window displays. This will not only cooperate with the propaganda of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but also benefit the store's business. A fabric store in Shanghai once decorated its entire window into a window display with the theme of "Don't Listen to the Voice of America," using bamboo strips to make a paper tiger, with the American flag painted on its body. The paper tiger was making a gesture of broadcasting to China; on the other side was a model of a young man who was cutting off the radio wire with scissors. This window display attracted many passers-by to watch. Such effective cartoon window displays are worth emulating by patriotic and progressive merchants.
    This mass reproduction of cartoons, on the one hand, plays the role of an artistic weapon, and on the other hand, can make cartoons deeply penetrate the masses, listen to the criticism of the masses, thereby strengthening the connection between cartoon workers and the masses, making cartoonists more familiar with the requirements of the masses and knowing the expression methods they like, so as to improve the creation of cartoons. At the same time, it cultivates new cartoon talents among the masses, which can continuously strengthen our fighting cartoon team.
    Art groups, publications, and professional cartoonists should pay great attention to this cartoon reproduction work. Art publications should regularly publish or introduce some relevant guiding papers or experiences in creating cartoons. Art groups can organize systematic cartoon lectures or symposiums to continuously improve the artistic level of art lovers in various factories, schools, people's cultural centers, and reading groups; and help outstanding learners to independently create cartoons. Through lectures or symposiums, professional cartoonists can more frequently and directly listen to the opinions of the masses, so that cartoon creation can be continuously improved.

### 应当重视群众性的漫画复制工作

　　应当重视群众性的漫画复制工作
    高蒙
    把报纸和杂志上的漫画，照样子放大画出来，再涂上彩色，贴在工厂、学校、机关、人民文化馆的大门口或墙报上，或贴在大街上，这在苏南区来说已经是个群众性的宣传方法和艺术活动了。我想别的地区也会有同样的情形。这些漫画大都画得很好，并不走样，加上是放大了的，又上了颜色，色彩鲜明，比原画更能吸引人。因为它们都是与现实结合得很紧的，所以能够充分发挥抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传作用。如“不听美国之音”、“美国鬼子在朝鲜被中朝人民军打得落花流水”、“美蒋匪特暴行”、“不法地主的鬼花样”等漫画，都很受群众欢迎；连环漫画如“美帝侵华史”等，看的人更多。
    最近我在上海文汇报上，看到有人建议把漫画复制运动扩展到商店橱窗中去。在橱窗一角，以不妨碍商品陈列为原则，尽量发动爱国的店主、店员陈列漫画复制品。规模较大的商店，可将平面的漫画改装成立体的橱窗陈设。这样，不但配合了抗美援朝的宣传，而且对商店的生意也有好处。上海有一家布店曾将整个橱窗布置成一个以“不听美国之音”为内容的橱窗陈设，用竹丝扎了一只纸老虎，身上绘着美国国旗，这只纸老虎正在做着向中国播音的姿势；另一边有一个青年人的模型，他正在用剪刀剪断无线电电线。这个橱窗陈设，吸引了许多行人观看。这种极有效果的漫画橱窗陈设，是值得爱国进步的商人效法的。
    这种群众性的漫画复制工作，一方面发挥了作为艺术武器的作用，一方面可以使漫画深入群众，听取群众的批评，从而加强漫画工作者和群众的联系，使漫画家更熟悉群众的要求和知道他们喜爱的表现方法，以改进漫画的创作工作。同时，又在群众中培养了新的漫画人才，可以不断地壮大我们战斗的漫画队伍。
    美术团体刊物和专业的漫画工作者们，应当十分重视这个漫画复制工作。美术刊物上，应经常刊登或介绍一些有关的指导性的论文或创作漫画的经验等。美术团体可以组织系统的漫画讲座或座谈会，不断提高各工厂、学校、人民文化馆、读报组内美术爱好者的艺术水平；并帮助其中优秀的学习者独立地创作漫画。通过讲座或座谈会，专业漫画家可以更经常更直接地听取群众的意见，使漫画创作不断得到改进。
