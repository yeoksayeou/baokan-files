　　We Seriously Elect Beijing Municipal People's Representatives
    To the Editor:
    The upcoming Third Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference stipulates that, in addition to a small number of government representatives and invited representatives, representatives will be elected through election meetings or representative election conferences in all organized mass groups. Direct elections will be implemented in public-owned industrial and mining enterprises and institutions of higher education; direct or indirect elections will be implemented in other people's organizations.
    When this news reached Tsinghua University, all teachers, students, and staff were very excited and expressed their willingness to actively participate in this historically significant democratic election. This democratic election is something that we Chinese people obtained after paying an immeasurable price in blood and struggle. During the period of reactionary rule, it was illegal for the people to concern themselves with politics. At that time, the "elections" manipulated by the reactionary ruling class were carried out through bribery, threats, and intimidation. Now, the domestic reactionaries have been basically overthrown, and the people have become masters of their own destiny. In the people's capital – Beijing – democratic elections are beginning to be held among organized people. This is truly exciting.
    Today, we are able to have the conditions to enrich and expand democratic life, which is inseparable from Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army. Furthermore, the elimination of counter-revolutionary elements and the establishment of revolutionary order in the two years since Beijing's liberation; the formation, development, and consolidation of various people's organizations; the general improvement of the level of awareness of all strata of the people after political study and cultural education, especially patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country; and the consolidation of the people's democratic united front have created the conditions for universal elections of representatives among organized people. This fact marks the consolidation and victory of the people's regime.
    The election affairs of our school are conducted by the election committee jointly composed of the trade union, the student union, and the administrative department. They consult with all parties and, after discussions in various grassroots groups and classes, propose a list of candidates who can most widely represent the opinions of the masses and are supported by the masses. Formal representatives are then generated through democratic elections. We seriously elect Beijing Municipal People's Representatives because everyone understands how much the Chinese people have paid to win this democratic right, and the great significance and role of this election in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　我们认真选举北京市人民代表
    编辑同志：
    最近即将召开的北京市第三届各界人民代表会议，其代表产生方法中规定：除了很少的政府代表和邀请代表外，将在所有有组织的群众中，召开选举大会或选举代表大会来选举代表。在公营工矿企业单位和专科以上学校单位中，实行直接选举；在其他人民团体中，实行直接或间接选举。
    这个消息传到清华大学后，全校师生员工都非常兴奋，纷纷表示要积极参加这一有历史意义的民主选举。这种民主选举是我们中国人民流血斗争付出了无比的代价后才得到的。在反动统治时期，人民过问政治是非法的。那时，在反动统治阶级操纵下的“选举”，是用贿赂和威胁、恐吓等方法来进行的。现在，国内反动派基本上已经打倒，人民翻身作了主人。在人民的首都——北京，首先开始在有组织人民中进行民主选举。这实在是令人兴奋的事。
    今天我们能够有条件充实并扩大民主生活，是和毛主席英明的领导及人民解放军的英勇战斗分不开的。而北京解放二年来，反革命分子活动的肃清，革命秩序的建立；各种人民团体的组成、发展与巩固；各阶层人民的觉悟程度经过政治学习和文化教育、尤其是抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义教育后的普遍提高；和人民民主统一战线的巩固，创造了在有组织人民中进行普选代表的条件。这个事实，标志着人民政权的巩固和胜利。
    我们学校的选举事宜由工会、学生会和行政部门联合组成选举委员会，负责进行。他们和各方面协商，并经过各基层小组、班级讨论后，提出最能广泛代表群众意见，并为群众拥护的候选人名单。再经过民主选举来产生正式代表。我们认真选举北京市人民代表，因为大家都了解中国人民为争取这种民主权利曾付出了多少代价，以及这次选举对巩固人民民主专政的巨大意义和作用。
