　　Yushu Area's Eleven Ethnic Groups Actively Engage in Trade
　　Large Quantities of Wool and Leather Arrive in Huangyuan, Qinghai
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Tibetan people from Chengduo County in the upper reaches of the Tongtian River in the Yushu area of southern Qinghai Province sent a delegation of over 110 people last autumn (including representatives from eleven ethnic groups), led by Ri'ang, a representative from Labrang Monastery. They gathered 3,000 yaks and carried over 120,000 jin of wool and over 30,000 jin of leather (approximately 6,000 hides) to Huangyuan County near Xining City for trade and to visit government leaders and tour construction sites. They set off at the end of last October, trekking 2,000 li and taking two and a half months to arrive successively around January 20th this year. On the way, they encountered the Guoluo people from the Bayan Har Mountains, who had completed their transactions in Huangyuan County and were returning with profits. They learned that the state-owned trading company provided courteous service, reliable weighing, and fair transactions. Therefore, upon arrival, they immediately sought out the trading company. The company promptly arranged accommodation for them, weighed the wool and leather the next day, and paid them the same day. To cater to their past habit of using silver dollars, the payment was made in silver dollars. Unexpectedly, they preferred Renminbi over silver dollars, saying, "All ethnic brothers in the Yushu area trust Renminbi."

　　On January 27th, Manager Cui of the trading company specially guided seventeen representatives among them to Xining, prepared rice, grapes, dates, and other daily necessities for them to take back, and invited them to watch movies and take photos. They were very happy. After taking the photos, they formed a circle and danced a Tibetan dance. One of the young men even led everyone in singing: "At the edge of the sea and the corner of the sky, a sun rises from the dark clouds, shining brightly, warming the Tongtian River, and awakening the people on both banks to engage in busy production, busy production." They said, "When the bandit Ma Bufang ruled, a cattle hide was negotiated for five silver dollars, but only two were given. There was a risk of being robbed halfway, so everyone was afraid to trade. This time is the first time to trade after liberation. Along the way, we were protected by the People's Government and the stationed troops, and the trading company purchased our wool at a standard price of 7,500 yuan per jin, an increase of 300 yuan. Everything is completely opposite to the past. This is the happiness brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberating Qinghai." They originally thought that the proceeds would be just enough for round-trip expenses and living costs, but they did not expect that the prices of hides and furs had increased under the new China's trade policy, and food and cloth were so cheap in the year after liberation that "one ox brought it, but eight oxen couldn't carry it back," which would allow them to return with great profits. They said that they must publicize this to their Tibetan compatriots upon returning, organize more materials for exchange, and especially transport the hides and furs accumulated by the people on both sides of the Tongtian River for many years in batches to exchange for the food, cloth, and necessities they need to improve the lives of all ethnic groups. When they met with Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of Qinghai Province, they presented Zhao Shoushan with a "hada" (a silk scarf), which they considered their most precious gift, to express their love for the People's Government.

　　玉树区十一族人民踊跃进行贸易
    大批羊毛牛皮运抵青海湟源
    【本报讯】青海省南部玉树区通天河上游称多县的藏民，去秋推派代表一百十余人（包括十一族），由拉卜寺代表日昂率领，集合犏牛三千头，驮了十二万余斤羊毛和三万多斤牛皮（约六千张）至西宁市附近的湟源县贸易，并顺便看望政府首长，参观各处建设。他们是从去年十月底动身的，跋涉两千里，经过二个半月的时间，才于今年一月二十日左右陆续到达。途中他们遇到在湟源县交易完毕获利而归的巴颜喀喇山的果洛族人民，得知国营贸易公司招待殷勤，过秤可靠，交易公平，因此一到就找贸易公司。公司当即为他们安置了休息地方，次日便把羊毛牛皮过秤，当天付清款子。为照顾他们以往用白洋的习惯，所以付的款子是白洋，不料他们宁要人民币不要白洋，并说：“在玉树区各族弟兄都信仰人民币。”
    一月二十七日，贸易公司崔经理特地引导他们之中的十七位代表到达西宁，替他们准备了带回去的大米、葡萄、枣和日用品等物资，并招待他们看电影、照相。他们十分高兴，照完了相，就围成一个圈跳起藏舞来。其中一个青年还领导全体唱起歌来：“海涯天角，乌云中升起一轮太阳，光芒万丈，温暖了通天河，唤醒了两岸的人民生产忙，生产忙。”他们说：“马匪步芳统治时，一张牛皮讲好是五块白洋，结果只给两块，货走到半途会有被抢光的危险，因此大家都不敢来做买卖。这次是解放后第一次来作买卖，沿途受到人民政府和驻军的保护，贸易公司并给我们按照每斤羊毛七千五百元的标准价提高三百元收购，一切情形和过去完全相反了，这都是共产党、毛主席解放青海给我们带来的幸福。”他们原来以为货款用于来回盘费及生活费用便差不多了，没想到皮毛在新中国贸易政策下提高了价格，食粮布匹在解放后一年功夫里就这样便宜，“一个牛驮来，八个牛还驮不回去”，可以大大获利而归。他们表示回去一定要给藏民同胞宣传，再组织更多的物资运来交换，特别要把通天河两岸人民多年积存的皮毛等特产分批运送出来，换回他们应用的食粮布匹和必需品，以改善各族人民的生活。在见到青海省赵寿山主席时，他们为表示对人民政府的热爱，特将他们认为最贵重的礼物“哈达”（绒织品）一个献给了赵主席。（金鼎）（附图片）
