Reader's Letter

    Li Xin, manager of the No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Lingling County, Hunan Province (a joint state-private enterprise), frequently beat and scolded workers. When the factory established a trade union preparatory committee last year, Li Xin told the workers, "Being a trade union representative is for fools," suppressing workers from organizing a trade union. Later, when Li Rui, Yang Jinsheng, and Zhu Fashun were elected as persons in charge of the preparatory committee, Manager Li was displeased and arbitrarily appointed his son-in-law, Yan Guangfu, as the director of the trade union preparatory committee. In addition, Li Xin often undermined worker unity, telling the apprentices, "Apprentices are family, so you must work hard and not learn from the masters who are troublemakers; if the masters make trouble, get them out of here. The old masters can find food when they leave, but you won't have any food if you leave!" Apprentices Peng Daidi, Chen Tianyi, Tang Damei, Wu Xiaomao, and others were severely beaten by Li Xin one after another because they didn't do a good job. He also forced female technician He Caifeng to weave twenty bolts of plaid cloth every month, and if she couldn't, he would scold her until she cried and took sick leave to go home. Last year, when the trade union was re-elected, worker Chen Hongfa was elected as the director of the trade union, and Li Xin tried every means to win him over and promoted Chen Hongfa to the position of chief of the engineering section.
    Manager Li's actions have aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the workers. Worker Zhang Dai said, "The workers of the No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory have not been emancipated." Workers generally reflect: "You can't speak your mind; if you do, your job is not secure." Manager Li does not accept the workers' suggestions on production. For example, the reeling machine is not good and often drops yarn, and there is no sizing room, so it is impossible to size yarn on rainy days. The workers demanded that these problems be solved, but the factory refused to accept them. In the first half of January of this year, due to cloudy and rainy weather, it was impossible to size the yarn, and many workers were unable to work on the machines for half a month, resulting in a significant decrease in production. Worker Wang Xueliang could not afford to support his family due to the shutdown and transferred to the Shengli Dyeing and Weaving Factory.
    After hearing about these situations, the county Federation of Trade Unions is now starting to investigate the facts, but they should go deep into the masses of workers and listen to their opinions.

### 湖南零陵县第一染织厂经理李鑫竟打骂工人

    湖南零陵县第一染织厂
　　经理李鑫竟打骂工人
    湖南零陵县第一染织厂（公私合营）经理李鑫经常打骂工人。去年该厂成立工会筹委会时，李鑫即对工人说：“当工会代表是蠢人”，打击工人组织工会。以后李蕊、杨金声、朱发顺三人当选为筹委会负责人时，李经理不高兴，竟擅自指定他的女婿严光福为工会筹委会主任。此外李鑫又经常破坏工人团结，对练习生说：“练习生是自家人，要好好干，不要学师傅一样挑皮；师傅挑皮，就把他们搞出去。老师傅出去有饭吃，你们出去没有饭吃！”练习生彭带娣、陈天宜、唐大梅、伍小毛等因活作得不好，先后遭李鑫痛打。他又强迫女技工何彩凤每月一定要织出二十匹格子布，织不出来就骂，骂得何痛哭流涕，请病假回家去了。去年改选工会时，工友陈洪发当选为工会主任，李鑫就多方拉拢他，提拔陈洪发为工务股长。
    李经理这些行动，已引起工人普遍不满。工友张戴说：“第一染织厂工人没翻身。”工人普遍反映：“讲不得话，讲话的人饭碗就靠不住。”工人对生产上提出的意见，李经理也不采纳。如摇纱机不好，常常掉纱，没有浆纱房，落雨天便无法浆纱；工人要求设法解决这些问题，厂方都不接受。今年一月上半月，因天气阴雨，无法浆纱，许多工人半个月没有上机子工作，生产量显著降低。工友王学良因停工养不起家小，转到胜利染织厂去了。
    该县总工会听到这些情况后，现正着手调查事实真象，但应深入工人群众中，听取他们的意见。
