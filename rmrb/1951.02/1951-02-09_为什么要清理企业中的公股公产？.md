Why Clean Up Public Shares and Public Assets in Enterprises?
    Qian Jiaju

    Since liberation, there have been three different types of enterprises in our country. One type is purely state-owned enterprises invested and operated by the government. Another type is purely private enterprises invested and operated by private individuals. The third type is public-private joint ventures or private enterprises with public shares and public assets. State-owned enterprises and private enterprises do not have problems with property rights and equity. Only the third type is the most complex, and the most disputes occur. Among them, some were originally private enterprises, but the Kuomintang reactionary government or its state economic organs, financial organs, war criminals, traitors, and bureaucratic capital invested in them. After liberation, this part of the shares and property was taken over by our People's Government. Some private enterprises were taken over by the enemy and puppet regime during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the enemy and puppet regime invested funds or added equipment. After the Japanese surrender, they were taken over by the Kuomintang government, and after liberation, we took them over from the Kuomintang. Some should have been returned to private individuals, but the Kuomintang government did not return them; but some should not have been returned, but were illegally returned due to collusion between the business owners and Kuomintang bureaucrats. There were also enterprises invested by bureaucratic capitalists, but some of them were not bureaucratic capitalists; also, some business owners fled overseas because they did not understand our government's policy of protecting national industry and commerce, and were temporarily managed by our government. In short, these enterprises have experienced three eras: the era of enemy and puppet occupation, the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, and the era of our People's Government. The changes in property rights and equity, the increase or decrease in equipment investment, are intricate and all-encompassing. After liberation, some enterprises have been taken over, managed, or supervised by our government, but the public and private property rights and equity have not yet been cleared up. On the other hand, some private enterprises, although they have public assets and public shares, have not yet been taken over and managed by the government, and this public assets and public shares are still concealed by private individuals. This kind of dispute over public and private equity has emerged one after another in the past year. If we cannot clean it up in a timely and proactive manner, it will not only have a bad impact on correcting the relationship between public and private interests, but also be a loss to state property. Because enterprises with private shares, if they are under military control or managed by the government for a long time, will damage the ownership of private property, and even make them doubt whether the People's Government's policy of protecting industry and commerce, and the Eight Articles of Agreement of the People's Liberation Army are really being implemented? But on the other hand, there are many private enterprises with public shares and public assets that have not reported to the government, and the public shares and public assets have not been cleared up, which causes undue losses to state property. Therefore, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has now promulgated the "Measures for Clearing Public Shares and Public Assets in Enterprises," which is very necessary both for correcting the relationship between public and private interests and for protecting state and private property.

    It must be pointed out that the term "enterprise" in these measures only refers to public-private joint ventures and private enterprises with public shares and public assets that have not yet been managed by the government. It does not mean that we are going to conduct a general investigation of all private enterprises. Our method of cleaning up is: for enterprises that have been taken over, managed, or supervised by the government, the taking-over, managing, or supervising agency shall invite other relevant agencies and private shareholder representatives to carry out the cleaning up in accordance with the methods stipulated in these measures. At the same time, private shareholder representatives may also apply to the taking-over, managing, or supervising agency and the local industrial and commercial administrative agency for cleaning up within three months. As for private enterprises with public shares and public assets that have not yet been managed or cleaned up by the government, the business operators of the enterprise shall automatically report the situation of public shares and public assets to the local government and apply for cleaning up. Therefore, the scope of the cleanup includes public-private joint ventures, private property in enterprises currently managed by the government, and state property in enterprises currently managed by private individuals. The government can be said to treat both the public and private parties equally.

    Secondly, the public shares and public assets we want to clean up include three items: (1) the shares and property of the Kuomintang reactionary government and its state economic organs, financial organs, etc. in the enterprise; (2) the shares and property of the former enemy government and its overseas Chinese in the enterprise; (3) the shares and property of war criminals, traitors, bureaucratic capitalists, etc. that have been confiscated in accordance with the law, and other shares and property that should be confiscated and turned over to the public in accordance with the law.

    In addition to the above three items, after liberation, new investments made by the People's Government and state economic organs and enterprise organs in the taken-over and managed enterprises should naturally be converted into public shares and handled together. As for the investment of public-private joint ventures (such as Xinhua Bank, China Industrial Bank, etc.) in another enterprise, except for the investment of China and Communications Banks, which can be regarded as public shares when calculating equity (the ownership still belongs to China and Communications Banks), generally they are not calculated as public shares, and the ownership still belongs to the original investing enterprise. That is to say, we only clean up the parent company of the public-private joint venture, but not the subsidiary company invested by the parent company.

    Regarding the method of cleaning up, it is stipulated that when cleaning up public shares and public assets, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council shall designate the competent authority according to the nature and scale of the enterprise. For enterprises that are national or of special importance, the Central Financial and Economic Committee shall directly designate the competent authority to be responsible for the cleanup; for enterprises that are only of a local nature, the Central Financial and Economic Committee shall entrust the Greater Administrative Region or the Provincial (Municipal) Financial and Economic Committee to designate the competent authority to be responsible for the cleanup. There are three types of competent authorities: one is the business competent authority, which is the relevant ministry, bank, and office of the Central People's Government at the central level, and the relevant department, bank, hall, and bureau at the local level. One is the investment competent authority, namely the Bank of Communications. The third is the industrial and commercial administrative agency, which is the Central Private Enterprise Bureau at the central level and the provincial and municipal industrial and commercial departments and bureaus at the local level. The division of labor among these three agencies is that the business competent authority is responsible for the business guidelines, production and business plan guidance and inspection of public-private joint ventures; the investment competent authority is responsible for the preservation of public shares, the collection and settlement of shareholder dividends, and the inspection of the implementation of financial plans; the industrial and commercial administrative agency is responsible for adjusting public-private relations. The Central Financial and Economic Committee or the Financial and Economic Committee of the Greater Administrative Region may designate a competent authority to be responsible for presiding over the cleanup in accordance with the specific circumstances of each enterprise, and the other two competent authorities shall assist in participating. For example, if an enterprise is particularly closely related to the business department, the business department should be responsible for presiding over it. If it is mainly about the custody of public shares and the collection and settlement of dividend surpluses, the investment department can be responsible for it. If the public-private relationship is more complicated, the industrial and commercial administrative agency shall preside over it. However, whichever agency is responsible for presiding over it, the other two competent authorities shall participate in the meeting as a principle. Only some very small enterprises or enterprises with a small proportion of public shares can be cleaned up independently by the Bank of Communications. Why should three agencies participate instead of one agency cleaning up alone? After liberation, public-private joint ventures with public shares in various places were generally taken over, managed, or supervised by the competent business departments according to the nature of the business. Although this can achieve the purpose of cooperating with the state's economic plan, since there is no unified agency to manage public shares, it is impossible to count how many public shares and public assets there are in the country, which disperses the state's funds. Therefore, the Central Financial and Economic Committee once issued a circular to all localities, stating that the ownership of public shares in all public-private joint ventures belongs to the Central Ministry of Finance and is managed uniformly by the Bank of Communications entrusted by the Central Ministry of Finance. Public shares in public-private joint ventures previously held by the central and local governments shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Secondly, since public and private equity are mixed together, disputes and disputes between public and private interests are inevitable. In order to correct the relationship between public and private interests and mediate public-private disputes, it is more appropriate for the industrial and commercial administrative agency to participate in the cleanup. The reason why these measures stipulate that the cleanup of enterprises should be the responsibility of the business, investment, and industrial and commercial administrative authorities for matters related to business, finance, and public-private relations in the enterprise is for this purpose. In addition, it is also stipulated that the competent authorities of public-private joint ventures should not directly manage public-private joint ventures, but should exercise their management rights through the public shareholder representatives and directors they send through the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors. As for the supervisors, they can naturally exercise their powers independently. Whether they are directors, supervisors, or other business operators from the public or private side, they are responsible to the entire enterprise, not just to the public or private side.

    The second is the provision on "public shareholder representatives, directors, and supervisors." All public shareholder representatives who participate in public-private joint ventures, or public directors and supervisors who participate in old and new boards of directors, shall be drafted by the designated competent authority in conjunction with other relevant competent authorities and submitted to the higher-level financial and economic committee for appointment. The list of public representatives, directors, and supervisors of national or particularly important public shares should be submitted to the Central Financial and Economic Committee for approval and appointment. The list of public representatives, directors, and supervisors of local enterprises may be approved and appointed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Greater Administrative Region, but must be reported to the Central Financial and Economic Committee for record. When there are more than three such public representatives and their directors and supervisors, the participation of the three competent authorities shall generally be the principle. However, for very small enterprises or enterprises with few public shares, public directors and supervisors may not be sent, as long as the Bank of Communications manages the public shares.

    Another key point of these measures is the "cleanup and reorganization procedure." The cleanup plan agreed upon by the public and private parties shall be approved by the higher-level Financial and Economic Committee, and the old board of directors and supervisors shall be reorganized first as a temporary management organization. During the reorganization, in addition to all public representatives being selected and sent by the government in accordance with regulations, private directors and supervisors shall not be changed except for war criminals, traitors, bureaucratic capitalists, and their agents who should be removed from their qualifications as directors and supervisors. After the public and private equity and property rights have been cleared and the investment ratio of both parties has been determined, a shareholders' meeting shall be convened within two months, and private shareholders shall be entitled to participate in accordance with the law. Public representatives shall be selected and sent by the government. The number of public and private directors and supervisors shall generally be distributed by the public and private parties through consultation according to the proportion of public and private equity. Public directors and supervisors shall be selected and sent by the government, and private directors and supervisors shall be freely elected by private shareholders. When the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors discuss issues related to public and private interests, they should try their best to adopt public-private consultation methods to seek fair and reasonable solutions. If the public and private parties encounter matters that cannot be agreed upon, they may report to the higher-level Financial and Economic Committee or the industrial and commercial administrative agency for a ruling. The measures also stipulate that after the old board of directors and supervisors are reorganized, or after the public and private parties jointly form a temporary enterprise management agency to exercise their powers, the military representative system or government takeover, management, or supervision work should be terminated immediately.

    The last key point of these measures is the provision on the "cleanup period." Enterprises that are currently taken over, managed, or supervised by the government should be cleaned up within three months of the promulgation of these measures. Private shareholder representatives may also voluntarily apply to the government for cleanup. As for enterprises that have not been taken over, managed, or supervised by the government, the person in charge should voluntarily report the situation of the public shares and public assets of the enterprise to the government. Those who fail to report within the time limit shall be punished for concealing public property.

    In addition, there are many enterprises that are small in scale or not very important in nature, such as restaurants, bathhouses, and theaters. In the past, many of these enterprises had investments from traitors, war criminals, and bureaucratic capitalists. After liberation, this part of the investment was taken over by us. However, from the perspective of the state, these enterprises really do not need to be public-private joint ventures. These types of enterprises are probably mostly partnerships. Therefore, we also stipulate that the public shares and public assets in partnership enterprises shall be handled in three ways after cleanup, depending on the specific circumstances of the enterprise: (1) those with larger scales shall be reorganized into public-private joint-stock limited companies or joint-stock companies; (2) those with smaller scales shall withdraw public shares and sell them to private individuals, which shall be purely operated by private individuals; (3) if private individuals are unable to take over, the status quo shall be maintained temporarily, and the Bank of Communications shall manage the public shares or entrust the local government to manage them on its behalf. Secondly, public utilities with private shares, such as electric lights and tap water, are stipulated in the supplementary provisions that separate treatment measures shall be formulated according to the degree of importance and the proportion of public and private equity. Because these public utilities are closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, they are slightly different in nature from general private enterprises. Finally, the valuation method when clearing and valuing public shares and public assets shall be handled with reference to the provisions of the "Measures for Revaluing Assets and Adjusting Capital of Private Enterprises" recently promulgated by the Central Financial and Economic Committee.

    Cleaning up public shares and public assets in enterprises is a very complicated task. The changes in property rights and equity in the twelve years since the War of Resistance Against Japan have been too great. The People's Government absolutely respects legitimate private shares and private property. What should be returned must be returned. The government will never covet small profits and want to take advantage of private individuals. However, state property is the property of the people, and private encroachment or concealment will never be allowed. Distinguishing between public and private interests and taking into account all aspects is our determined policy. We hope that the comrades in charge and private capitalists in various places will actively carry out the cleanup of public shares and public assets in accordance with the provisions of these measures, so that this work can be successfully completed.

　　为什么要清理企业中的公股公产？
    千家驹
    解放以后，我国企业总共有三种不同的类型，一类是纯粹由政府投资经营的国营企业，一类是纯粹由私人投资经营的私营企业，还有一类是既有公家投资又有私人投资的公私合营或有公股公产在内的私营企业。国营企业与私营企业都不发生产权股权的问题，惟有第三类，情况最为复杂，发生的纠纷也最多。其中有的原属私营企业，中经国民党反动政府或其国家经济机关、金融机关、战犯、汉奸、官僚资本的投资，解放后这一部分的股份和财产被我人民政府所接收。也有些私营企业，抗战期间曾被敌伪所接管，敌伪曾经投入资金或添加了设备。日寇投降以后被国民党政府所接收，解放后我们再从国民党手中接管过来。有的是应该发还私人而国民党政府没有发还的；但也有的是不应该发还，而由于企业主与国民党官僚相勾结非法发还了的。还有些企业本为官僚资本家所投资，但其中一部分却非官僚资本家；也有企业主因不明了我政府保护民族工商业的政策逃避海外，而由我政府所暂时代管。总之，这些企业经历了三个朝代，即敌伪占领时代，国民党反动统治时代及我人民政府时代。其中产权股权的变化，设备投资的增减，错综复杂，应有尽有。在解放以后，有一部分企业已为我政府所接管、代管或监管，但公私产权股权迄未加以清理。另一方面，也有些私营企业，虽有公产公股在内，尚未经政府接收及参加管理，此项公产公股仍为私人所隐匿。这种公私股权的纠纷，一年以来已迭出不穷，如果我们不能及时并主动的加以清理，不但对于端正公私关系上有不好的影响，而且对于国家财产来说，也是一种损失。因为有私人股份在内的企业，如长期由政府军管或代管下去，就会损害到私人财产的所有权，甚至使他们怀疑到人民政府的保护工商业政策，怀疑到解放军的约法八章，是否真正在执行？但另一方面，又有许多有公股公产在内的私营企业，还没有向政府报告，公股公产部分还没有清理，这就使国家财产受到不应该有的损失。因此现在政务院财政经济委员会颁布了《企业中公股公产清理办法》，无论就端正公私关系，或保护国家及私人财产来说，都是十分必要的。
    必须指出，本办法所称的企业仅仅是指公私合营企业，及有公股公产在内而政府尚未参加管理的私营企业而言，并不是我们对于所有私营企业要来一次清查。我们清理的方式是：已由政府接管代管或监管的企业，应由接管、代管或监管的机关，邀同其他有关机关及私股代表，按照本办法所规定办法进行清理，同时私股代表亦得于三个月内自动向接管、代管或监管机关及地方工商行政机关提出申请清理。至于有公股公产，而尚未经政府参加管理或清理的私营企业，则由该企业的业务执行人自动向地方政府报告公股公产情况，申请清理。所以清理的范围，包括公私合营企业，现由政府管理的企业中的私人财产，和现由私人管理的企业中的国家财产，政府对于公私双方可以说是一视同仁的。
    其次，我们所要清理的公股公产包括三项：（一）国民党反动政府及其国家经济机关、金融机关等在企业中的股份及财产；（二）前敌国政府及其侨民在企业中的股份及财产；（三）业经依法没收的战犯、汉奸、官僚资本家等在企业中的股份及财产，以及其他依法应予没收归公的股份及财产。
    除以上三项外，解放以后，人民政府及国家经济机关、企业机关，在接管、代管的企业中新的投资，自然也应转作公股，合并处理。至于公私合营企业（例如新华银行、中国实业银行等）对另一企业的投资，除了中国、交通两银行的投资在计算股权时得视为公股计算外（所有权仍归中、交两行），一般都不作为公股计算，所有权仍属于原投资企业。就是说我们只清理公私合营企业的母公司，而不清理母公司所投资的子公司。
    关于清理的办法是，规定公股公产进行清理时，由政务院财政经济委员会按照企业性质及规模大小分别指定主管机关。凡属全国性或特殊重要性的企业，由中财委直接指定主管机关负责清理；仅属地方性质的企业，则由中财委委托大行政区或省（市）财委指定主管机关负责清理。所谓主管机关共有三种：一是业务主管机关，在中央为中央人民政府有关部、行、署，在地方为地方有关各部、行、厅、局。一是投资主管机关，即交通银行。三是工商行政机关，在中央为中央私营企业局，在地方为省市工商厅局。这三个机关工作上的分工是业务主管机关负责公私合营企业的业务方针，生产和营业计划的指导及检查；投资主管机关负责公股股票的保存，股东红利的收解及财务计划执行状况的检查；工商行政机关负责调整公私关系。中财委或大行政区财委得按照每一企业的具体情况指定某一主管机关负责主持，其他两主管机关协助参加。例如某一企业如与业务部门关系特别密切的，就应由业务部门负责主持，倘主要是一些公股股权的保管及红利盈余的收解，则可由投资部门负责。如果公私关系比较复杂的，则由工商行政机关主持。但无论是那一个机关负责主持，其他两个主管机关均以会同参加为原则，只有一些规模很小，或公股所占比例很少的企业得由交通银行负责单独清理。为什么要三个机关参加而不由一个机关单独进行清理呢？解放以后，各地有公股在内的公私合营企业，一般都是按照业务的性质，由各主管业务部门接管，代管或监管的，这虽然可以达到配合国家的经济计划的目的，但由于没有一个统一的机关管理公股，全国各地究竟有多少公股公产，就无从统计，这样就分散了国家的资金。因此中财委曾经通令各地，所有公私合营企业，公股的所有权都属于中央财政部，而由中央财政部委托交通银行统一管理。过去由中央及地方政府掌握的公私合营企业中的公股，均应依本办法规定办理移交。其次，既有公私股权参杂一起，一些公私间的争执与纠纷，势所难免，为了要端正公私关系，调解公私纠纷，工商行政机关参加清理，较为合适。本办法所以规定了企业的清理，应由业务、投资、工商行政三个主管机关分别负责企业中有关业务、财务、公私关系等事项，目的即在于此。此外还规定公私合营企业的各主管机关不应当直接去管理公私合营企业，而应当经由所派公股代表及董事，通过股东会及董事会行使其管理权，至于监察人自然可以单独行使职权。不论公方或私方的董监及其他业务执行人，都是对于整个企业负责而不是单独对公方或私方负责的。
    其次是关于“公股代表，董事、监察人”的规定，凡参加公私合营企业的公股股东代表，或参加新旧董事会的公股董监，一律由指定的主管机关会同其他有关主管机关拟具，送上级财委指派。凡属全国性或特殊重要性的公股代表及董监名单，应该送中财委批准任命。凡属地方性企业的公股代表及董、监名单，得由大行政区财委批准任命，但要呈报中财委备案。这种公股代表及其董监在三人以上时，一般以三个主管机关参加为原则，不过规模很小的或公股很少的企业就可以不派公股董监，只要由交通银行把公股股权管理起来就是了。
    本办法的另一要点是关于“清理改组程序”。公私双方商定的清理方案，经上级财委批准后，应先改组旧董事会及监察人，作为临时性的管理机构。改组时除所有公股代表依照规定由政府选派外，私股董监除战犯汉奸官僚资本家及其代理人应撤销其董监资格外，一律不予更动。待公私股权产权清估完毕，双方投资比例确定后，于两个月内召开股东会，私股股东均得依法参加，公股代表由政府选派。公私董监的人数一般应该按照公私股权比例，由公私双方协商分配，公股董监由政府选派，私股董监由私股股东自由选举。当股东会和董事会讨论有关公私问题时，应该尽量采取公私协商方式求得公平合理解决。公私双方如遇有不能成立协议的事项，可以报请上级财委会或工商行政机关裁定。办法中又规定了旧董事会及监察人经改组后，或公私双方合组临时性的企业管理机关行使职权之后，军代表制或政府接管，代管或监管工作应该立即结束。
    本办法最后一个要点是关于“清理期限”的规定。现在由政府接管、代管或监管的企业，都应该于本办法公布三个月内进行清理。私股代表也得自动向政府提出申请清理。至于未经政府接管代管或监管的企业，负责人应该向政府自动报告该企业公股公产的情况，逾期不报者应按隐匿公产加以处罚。
    此外还有许多企业，规模很小或者性质很不重要，例如饭馆、澡塘、戏院之类，这种企业过去多有汉奸、战犯、官僚资本家的投资，解放之后这部分投资就被我们所接收了。但这种企业就国家的立场来说，实在没有公私合营的必要，这类企业大概以合伙居多。所以我们又规定合伙企业中的公股公产于清理之后，得视企业具体情况分三种办法处理：（一）规模较大的，改组为公私合营的有限公司或股份有限公司；（二）规模较小的则撤回公股，卖给私人，纯由私人经营。（三）如果私人无力接收，则暂维现状，由交通银行掌握公股股权或委托地方政府代为管理。其次，有私股在内的公用事业，例如电灯自来水等等，附则中规定得按重要程度及公私股权比例大小，另定处理办法。因为这种公用事业与国计民生有密切的关系，与一般的私营企业性质稍有不同。最后关于清估公股公产时的估价办法，得参照最近中财委所颁布的“私营企业重估财产调整资本办法”的规定办理。
    清理企业中的公股公产是一件很繁杂的工作。自抗战以来这十二年中产权股权的变化太大了，人民政府对于合法的私股私产是绝对尊重的，应该发还的一定发还，政府绝不会贪图小利，想占私人的便宜。但是国家的财产就是人民的财产，也决不允许私人的侵占或隐匿。公私分明，兼筹并顾，是我们决定了方针，希望各地负责同志及私人资本家，都本着本办法的规定积极进行公股公产的清理工作，使这项工作得以顺利完成。
