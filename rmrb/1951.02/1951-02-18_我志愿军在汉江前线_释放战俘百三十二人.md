　　Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Han River Front
　  Releases 132 Prisoners of War
    【Xinhua News Agency, Han River Front, 17th】The Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently released 132 prisoners of war on the Han River front. Among them were 41 American citizens, 5 British citizens, 3 Australian citizens, and 83 of the Li bandit army. These prisoners were captured during the New Year offensive launched by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the beginning of this year. After being captured, they received the lenient treatment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who did not kill, insult, or search their pockets, and were provided with care in terms of life and medical treatment. Before releasing the prisoners of war, the working organs of the Volunteer Army's prisoner management department held a dinner and farewell party for them, and provided them with travel expenses. The released prisoners of war believed that this humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was in stark contrast to the crimes of the American invading army and the Li Seung-man bandit army in massacring prisoners of war. Some prisoners said: After we go back, we will never be cannon fodder for the Wall Street tycoons and Li Seung-man again.

　　我志愿军在汉江前线
　  释放战俘百三十二人
    【新华社汉江前线十七日电】中国人民志愿军最近在汉江前线释放战俘一百三十二人。其中美国籍四十一人、英国籍五人、澳大利亚籍三人、李匪军八十三人。这些俘虏是在本年初朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发起的新年攻势中被俘的。他们被俘以后受到了中国人民志愿军不杀、不辱、不搜腰包的宽大待遇，和生活上医疗上的照顾。志愿军管理俘虏的工作机关在释放战俘前，特为他们举行聚餐和开欢送会，并发给路费。被释放的俘虏们认为中国人民志愿军这种对战俘的人道待遇，是和美国侵略军和李承晚匪军屠杀战俘的罪行恰成一个极鲜明的对照。有的俘虏说：我们回去以后决不再替华尔街大亨们和李承晚当炮灰了。
