　　Emphasizing Creative Labor
　　--Introducing the Worker's Daily report on Chen Zhongfu
　　On the 12th of last month, the Beijing Worker's Daily published a front-page headline about an educator, Mr. Chen Zhongfu, a biology teacher at Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School, "Extracting Tapeworms from Student Feces to Make Specimens for Student Education." It also published a newsletter, "How Did Teacher Chen Make Tapeworm Specimens?" and an editorial praising it as a teaching example that combines theory and practice. The editorial also called on trade union organizations to "not only learn a new teaching spirit and new teaching methods from Mr. Chen Zhongfu's teaching methods, but also learn a method of trade union work that connects with the masses from praising Mr. Chen Zhongfu's teaching spirit and teaching methods." It is very correct that the Worker's Daily attaches great importance to this matter.
　　Because the world is created by labor. We should regularly promote new labor creations and encourage the enthusiasm of laborers to accelerate the progress of our country. Before the success of the revolution, laborers were slaves, labor was not respected by the exploiting classes, and the creations of laborers were never valued or were plundered. But after the success of the revolution, this situation changed. Laborers have become masters of the country, labor is respected by society, and the initiative and creativity of laborers can be freely developed. Therefore, the people's newspapers should regularly publicize all creative labor to encourage the initiative and creativity of laborers. Mr. Chen Zhongfu's deeds are just one example of the thousands of creative efforts of laborers in the new society.
　　Under normal circumstances, using betel nut water to kill tapeworms is not a major scientific contribution, and using specimens for teaching is not a new method. The problem is that the school where Mr. Chen Zhongfu is located has great difficulty in obtaining specimens. Without the necessary specimens, students cannot be effectively educated in biology. Therefore, Mr. Chen Zhongfu never forgets to serve his students. As early as August of the year before last, he began to consider how to use his own hands to solve the current lack of standard instruments in the school. He searched everywhere for various rare animals and plants and made his own specimens by soaking them. By last year, he had collected more than 100 kinds of specimens, large and small. Among all these specimens, the most commendable is the process of making tapeworm specimens. Because in his biology teaching, when he talked about tapeworms, without this kind of specimen explanation, students often doubted how such a large worm of two or three feet long could grow in the human body. For this reason, he personally inspected the feces of more than 70 students and workers for seven or eight months since last spring, and found that two people had tapeworms in their bodies. He used a very simple prescription—betel nut water—to remove the tapeworms from the students and make specimens. Last September, he found a piece of pork with tapeworm larvae cysts and prepared it into a specimen in the same way. In this way, not only was the difficulty of not having specimens solved, but also these vivid and practical examples were used as teaching materials, which achieved significant achievements in teaching. This spirit of overcoming difficulties and working hard is worth greatly promoting. The construction work of the new China has just begun, and there are many difficulties in revolutionary work and construction work, which require thousands of laborers to exert creative labor to overcome these difficulties. It is completely correct to value this effort.
　　The emergence of Mr. Chen Zhongfu's creative labor attitude is inseparable from the establishment of the people's regime. The Worker's Daily report pointed out this point, and promoted patriotism from this aspect. From the example of Mr. Chen Zhongfu, people realize the superiority of the people's democratic system, and thus love their country. This kind of publicity is very meaningful.

### 重视创造性的劳动——介绍工人日报关于陈仲孚的报道

　　重视创造性的劳动
    ——介绍工人日报关于陈仲孚的报道
    上月十二日北京工人日报以一版头条地位发表了一个教育工作者——河北省立北京师范生物教员陈仲孚先生“从学生粪便取下绦虫，制成标本教育学生”的新闻，并发表了“陈老师是怎样做出绦虫标本的？”的通讯，还写了一篇社论来加以表扬，认为是理论与实践相结合的教学范例。该社论并号召工会组织“不但要从陈仲孚先生的教学方法中，学到一种新的教学精神与新的教学方法，而且要从表扬陈仲孚先生的教学精神与教学方法中，学会一种联系群众的工会工作方法。”工人日报对这件事给予很大的重视，是很正确的。
    因为世界是劳动创造的。我们应当经常宣传新的劳动创造，鼓励劳动者创造的热情，以加速我们国家的进步。在革命成功以前，劳动者是奴隶，劳动不被剥削阶级所尊重，劳动者的创造从来不被重视，或者被人掠夺。但在革命成功以后，这种情形改变了。劳动者已成为国家的主人，劳动受到社会的尊重，劳动者的积极性和创造性已有自由发挥的可能。因此，人民的报纸就应当经常宣传一切创造性的劳动，以鼓励劳动者的积极性和创造性。陈仲孚先生的事迹，不过是新社会中的劳动者千万个创造性的努力中的一个例子。
    在通常的情形下，用槟榔水打绦虫，并不是重大科学的贡献，用标本进行教学，也不是新的方法，问题在于陈仲孚先生所在的学校，标本甚为困难，没有必要的标本，在生物学教学上，就不能有效地教育学生，因此陈仲孚先生就时时刻刻不忘为同学服务，他早从前年八月开始，就考虑如何用自己双手来解决目前学校缺乏的标准仪器，他到处搜罗各种难得的动物与植物，由自己浸制成标本，直到去年一共搜集大小标本一百多种。而所有这些标本中，特别值得称赞的，是关于他制造绦虫标本的经过。因为他在生物学的教学中，谈到绦虫时，而没有这种标本说明，因此，同学们常常怀疑人的身体中怎样能生长二三丈长的大虫子。为此，他从去年春天经过七八个月的努力，亲自检查了七十多位同学与工友的粪便，发现了两个人体内生有绦虫，他就用极简便的药方——槟榔水，把绦虫从同学身上打下，并制成标本。去年九月又寻找到一块带有绦虫幼虫囊胞的猪肉，也照样泡制成标本。这样一来，不但解决了没有标本的困难，而且用这些生动实际的事例来作为教材，在教学上获得了重大的成就。这种克服困难，努力工作的精神，是值得大大提倡的。新中国建国工作刚刚开始，革命工作和建设工作中都有很多困难，须要千千万万的劳动者发挥创造性的劳动来克服这些困难。重视这种努力是完全正确的。
    陈仲孚先生的创造性的劳动态度的出现，是和人民政权的成立分不开的。工人日报的报道指出了这一点，就从这一个方面宣传了爱国主义。从陈仲孚先生的例子，使人认识到人民民主制度的优越性，因而热爱自己的国家。这种宣传是很有意义的。
