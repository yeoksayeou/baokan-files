　　Rural Library in Yunjialing, Wu'an County, Hebei
    Yunjialing in the Fifth District of Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, is an old liberated area. After the people's living standards improved, the demand for cultural learning also became urgent. Under the enthusiastic mobilization of village cadres and primary school teacher Hao Maoshan, a rural library was established and officially opened on January 15th. The walls of the library are whitewashed very cleanly. There are reading tables and desks in the center of the room, and the books and newspapers are arranged particularly neatly. When visiting or reading, the masses consciously abide by the rules of the library. People borrowing, returning, reading, and visiting the rural library come and go in an endless stream every day.
    The Yunjialing Rural Library once held a planned exhibition to attract the masses to the library. On the day of the exhibition, more than a thousand men and women visited, and folks from nearby villages also came. After the village head read out the significance of establishing the rural library and the reading system, the masses all expressed their agreement. Many elderly people said, "I've lived my whole life and never seen anything like this." Young people were even more indescribably happy. In the past half month, more than 9,000 people have participated in reading in the village library, including village cadres, militiamen, supply and marketing cooperative staff, and winter school students.
    During the Spring Festival, the Yunjialing Rural Library will hold lectures, invite people to give speeches, and mobilize students to actively participate in recreational activities.

　　河北武安县云家岭的农村图书室
    邯郸专区武安县第五区云家岭，是老解放区，群众生活提高后，学习文化的要求也迫切起来。在村干部及小学教员郝茂善的热情发动下，创立了一所农村图书室，一月十五日正式开幕。图书室的墙壁粉饰得很洁白。室正中设有阅览桌案，书报摆的也格外整齐。群众在参观或者阅读时都能自觉地遵守着图书室的规矩。农村图书室里，每天借书、还书、阅览、参观的群众来往不绝。
    云家岭农村图书室曾有计划地开了一次展览会，吸引群众到图书室来。展览会那天，有一千多个男女群众参观，附近村子里的老乡也赶来了，在村长宣读了成立农村图书室的意义及阅览制度后，群众都表示同意，很多老年人都说：“活了一辈子也没有见到这回事。”年轻人更有说不出的高兴。该村图书室，半月来参加阅读的群众就有九千多名，其中包括：村干部、民兵、供销社职员及冬学学员们等。
    春节期间，云家岭的农村图书室里，将召开讲习会，请人讲演，并且发动学员积极参加文娱活动。
