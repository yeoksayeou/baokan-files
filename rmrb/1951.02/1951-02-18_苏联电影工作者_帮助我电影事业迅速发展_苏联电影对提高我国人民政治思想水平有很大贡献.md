Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: Soviet films and Soviet film workers have given considerable help to the education of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the rapidly developing Chinese people's film industry.

　　In terms of the distribution of Soviet films, after the successful trial production of Soviet translated films with Chinese dialogue, Soviet films were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Chinese audiences. In 1950, the Northeast Film Studio and the Shanghai Film Studio, both affiliated with the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, completed a total of 43 translated films. Among them, films such as "The Great Battle of Stalingrad," "The Fall of Berlin," "They Have a Motherland," "Secret Envoy," "Full of Peach and Plum," and "Lenin in October" created excellent records in their screenings in various places. According to preliminary statistics, approximately 62 million Chinese viewers watched Soviet films in 1950, with over 8 million in December alone. Soviet films have become one of the important materials for our people to learn from the revolutionary struggles and construction work experience of the Soviet people, and have achieved certain results in raising the political and ideological level of our people. Through the translation and production of Soviet films, Chinese film artists have better learned the creation and performance art of Soviet films.

　　In terms of film art, well-known Soviet directors and experts have given our film workers many specific guidance and assistance. The color historical documentary films "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," jointly produced by the Beijing Film Studio, affiliated with the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and the Soviet Central Documentary Film Studio and the Soviet Moscow Gorky Film Studio, were directed by the famous Soviet directors Gerasimov and Varlamov. These two films have achieved great success in terms of both ideology and art. Since the release of "The Victory of the Chinese People," the number of viewers has reached more than 3.31 million in December last year alone. In the process of making these two films, Gerasimov and Varlamov gave many specific help and guidance to the Chinese film workers participating in the production in terms of directing and performance art. They also used their spare time to give many reports on the experience of Soviet film art creation to Chinese film art creators. Bagryubov, the assistant director of "The Fall of Berlin," helped and guided the translation film staff of the Northeast Film Studio to more clearly understand the production methods of translated films, and gave special reports on the creative experience of "The Fall of Berlin" and the experience in Soviet film performance art to the staff of the Northeast Film Studio and the Beijing Film Studio.

　　In terms of film technology, recording expert Glebnev helped and guided the Northeast Film Studio in the re-recording method of translated films, improved the recording technology of translated films, and provided many specific suggestions for the improvement of the newly established music recording studio of the Beijing Film Studio. Photography experts Torshin and Ivanov, and lighting expert Neruskov, also provided valuable assistance to our country's film photography, lighting, and other technologies. In addition, the Soviet Union has done its best to supply film technology equipment and materials, which has solved many difficult problems in the technical equipment of our people's films.

    在苏联电影发行方面，从华语对白的苏联翻译片试制成功后，苏联影片受到广大中国观众热烈地欢迎。一九五○年内中央人民政府文化部电影局所属东北电影制片厂和上海电影制片厂共完成了翻译片四十三部。其中《斯大林格勒大血战》、《攻克柏林》、《他们有祖国》、《秘密使节》、《桃李满天下》、《列宁在十月》等片在各地上映的情形，都创造了优异的纪录。据初步统计，在一九五○年内看到苏联影片的中国观众约达六千二百余万人，在十二月一个月之内就有八百多万人。苏联影片已经成为我国人民学习苏联人民革命斗争和建设工作经验的重要材料之一，并在提高我国人民政治思想水平上已获得一定的成绩。中国电影艺术工作者，通过苏联影片的译制工作，更好地学习了苏联电影的创作和表演艺术。
    在电影艺术方面，苏联著名导演和专家们，都对我们电影工作者进行了许多具体的指导和帮助。中央人民政府文化部电影局所属北京电影制片厂和苏联中央文献电影制片厂、苏联莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂联合摄制的彩色历史纪录片《中国人民的胜利》和《解放了的中国》，就是由苏联著名导演格拉西莫夫和瓦尔拉莫夫担任导演的。这两部影片在思想上和艺术上都获得很大的成就。《中国人民的胜利》上映以来，仅据去年十二月间的统计，观众人数已达三百三十一万余人。在这两部影片的摄制过程中，格拉西莫夫和瓦尔拉莫夫对我国参加摄制的电影工作者在编导上和表演艺术上都进行了许多具体帮助和指导。他们并利用工作余暇，对我国电影艺术创作工作者作了多次有关苏联电影艺术创作经验的报告。《攻克柏林》的副导演巴格留波夫，曾帮助和指导东北电影制片厂的翻译片工作人员更明确地了解翻译片的制作方法、并对东北电影制片厂和北京电影制片厂的工作人员，作了有关“攻克柏林”的创作经验与苏联电影表演艺术上的经验等专题报告。
