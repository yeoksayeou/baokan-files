　　Northeast Had a Fiscal Surplus Last Year
    [Xinhua News Agency] In 1950, Northeast China's fiscal work not only achieved a balance of revenue and expenditure but also had a surplus. The total fiscal revenue of Northeast China in 1950 increased by 18.4 percent compared to the original plan. On the expenditure side, due to the reduction of secondary expenditures, it was 11.1 percent less than the original plan. The improvement of the financial situation in the Northeast region is primarily a result of the rapid increase in industrial and agricultural production, the strengthening of urban-rural exchanges, and the stability of finance and prices. Secondly, the Northeast fiscal departments implemented the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on unifying national financial and economic work, concentrating the financial power scattered in various provinces, cities, and units for planned use, thereby saving many unnecessary expenses. At the same time, on the basis of unified management, revenue work was strengthened, especially regarding urban tax revenue and the income from state-owned enterprises' profits. In addition, over the past year, the financial departments have continuously organized inspections in various areas, discovering and resolving many problems in financial management, thereby reducing a lot of waste.

　　东北去年财政有节余
    【新华社讯】东北一九五零年的财政工作不仅已做到收支平衡，而且还有节余。东北一九五零年全年财政收入较原计划增加了百分之十八点四，支出方面，因紧缩了次要的开支，较原计划节省了百分之十一点一。东北区财政状况的改进，首先是工农业生产的迅速提高，城乡交流的加强和金融物价稳定的结果。其次是东北财政部门贯彻了中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，把分散在各省市各单位的财政力量集中掌握，有计划地使用，因此节省了许多不必要的开支；同时在统一管理的基础上，加强了收入工作，其中特别是关于城市税收与国营企业利润的收入。此外，一年来财政部门不断地组织了各方面的检查，发现并解决了不少财政管理上的问题，因而减少了很多浪费。
