　　Children's Hearts
　　——A Record of Nanjing Children Donating Iron in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　Qiang Jianzhong
　　In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, the children of Nanjing used millions of small hands and millions of small legs to walk through every corner, collecting 40,000 catties of scrap iron to donate to the nation. They requested that this scrap iron be made into artillery shells to defend the border, or made into machines for production.
　　The children wearing red scarves all remember: During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they did not spend a single happy day. At that time, poor children had no books to read; children who went to school were subjected to the bullying of the Chiang Kai-shek-American bandits. From that time on, seeds of hatred were planted in their young hearts.
　　After the liberation of Nanjing, the children turned over a new leaf along with the people. The People's Government is particularly concerned about the younger generation. Children without money can also attend school for free. In school, the teachers are as kind as their own parents. Their own organization - the Young Pioneers - has also been established. The children received the warmth of the people's motherland for the first time.
　　After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the hearts of the children were stirred, and the seeds of hatred generated strength. They demanded to follow their older brothers and sisters in fighting against American imperialism. Last October, the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education issued a call to donate scrap iron. This news spread quickly among the students in various schools like a piece of good news. They said: We must respond to the call, we do not want to suffer the same misfortune as the Korean children.
　　They had heard the story of Soviet Young Pioneers donating scrap iron to make tanks to strike at the German invaders during the Great Patriotic War. Today, they are also bravely taking action, just like the Soviet Young Pioneers.
　　In order to donate scrap iron, the children persuaded their fathers and mothers. Chen Zhensheng, a student at Tiger Bridge Elementary School, had a mother who was initially reluctant to let her child take away a broken pot, but the child pleaded that he could do without a week's worth of snacks. The mother was moved and said, "Take it to school!" Zhang Yufa of Dingjiaji Elementary School also found many broken knives, broken pots and other scrap iron at home, totaling more than 30 catties. Many parents were influenced by the patriotic ideas of their children.
　　Whether in piles of rubble, ruins, hills, mud pits or rivers, the footprints of children were everywhere. Occasionally finding a piece of scrap iron could make them jump for joy for a long time. Students from Xiangpuying Elementary School heard from sanitation workers that there was scrap iron in the wasteland of Fuyilang, so they ran there in a puff of smoke; children from Meitantang Elementary School ran to the East Fort to find rusty steel bones. The children did not know what cold was, what hardship was, and did not even care if their clothes and shoes were torn. Mao Shancai and Kang Sugui of Changle Road Elementary School were busy like this, collecting 369 catties of scrap iron, creating the highest record.
　　The children of ninety elementary schools and eight middle schools played a collective role in the scrap iron collection movement. The children were organized around the Young Pioneers, and they divided the work: some searched, some were responsible for transportation or management. The organizational genius of the children was praised by the teachers.
　　On February 3rd this year, more than 10,000 children held a donation of iron and patriotism conference on the lawn of Nanjing University. Vehicles loaded with scrap iron followed the red flags flying in the wind through the streets. The members of the Young Pioneer team of Daxinggong Elementary School carried a plaque made of more than 1,000 copper coins forming the four characters "Donate Iron and Love the Country", and marched forward with glowing faces; the people who welcomed them on the street were deeply moved, because they brought glory to the people of Nanjing.
　　Twelve-year-old Young Pioneer member Lin Xueyun, on behalf of the city's children, presented the 40,000 catties of scrap iron collected over three months to the government at the conference, saying: "This is to show our love for the motherland and our gratitude to our dear Chairman Mao!"

　　孩子的心
    ——抗美援朝运动中南京少年儿童献铁记
    强剑衷
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，南京的少年儿童们用千万只小手和千万条小腿，走遍各个角落，搜集了四万斤废铁，献给国家。他们要求把这些废铁做成炮弹，保卫边疆，或者造成机器，进行生产。
    戴上红领巾的少年儿童们都记得：国民党反动统治时期，他们没有度过一天快乐的生活。当时，穷苦的小朋友们没有书读；入学的孩子，又受尽了蒋美匪徒的欺凌。幼稚的心灵，从那时起就埋下了仇恨的种子。
    南京解放后，少年儿童和人民一起翻了身。人民政府特别关心年青的一代。没有钱的小朋友也可以免费入学。在学校里，老师们象自己父母一样的亲切。他们自己的组织——少年儿童队也建立了起来。孩子们第一次得到了人民祖国的温暖。
    美帝国主义发动侵朝战争后，稚子之心被激动了，仇恨的种子产生了力量。他们要求跟随大哥大姐们向美帝进行斗争。去年十月，南京市文教局发出捐献废铁的号召。这个消息，就像件喜讯一样，在各校小朋友中间迅速地传布开来。他们说：我们一定响应号召，我们不愿像朝鲜小朋友一样遭受不幸。
    他们听到过苏联少先队员在卫国战争中捐献废铁制造坦克，打击德寇的故事。今天，他们也勇敢地行动起来，像苏联少先队员一样。
    为了捐献废铁，孩子们说服了自己的爸爸和妈妈。老虎桥小学学生陈振升的妈妈最初舍不得把一个破锅让孩子拿去，孩子恳求着说，他可以不要一个星期的点心钱。母亲被感动了，说：“把它捧到学校去吧！”丁家基小学张玉发也在家里找到许多坏刀、破锅等废铁，共有三十多斤。不少父母从孩子身上受到了爱国主义思想的影响。
    无论乱石堆，废墟中，山岗上，泥坑和河塘里，到处都有少年儿童的足迹。偶而拣到的一块废铁，就能使他们雀跃半天。香铺营小学的学生从清道工人那里打听到付衣廊荒场有废铁，就一溜烟地跑去了：煤炭港小学的儿童跑到东炮台去找生锈的钢骨。儿童们不知道什么是冷，什么是苦，甚至衣服、鞋子挂破了也不在乎。长乐路小学的毛善才、康苏贵就是这样不停地奔忙，搜集了三百六十九斤废铁，创造了最高纪录。
    九十个小学、八个中学的少年儿童，在搜集废铁运动中发挥了集体力量，小朋友们组织在少年队员的周围，他们分了工：有的搜寻，有的担任运输或管理。少年儿童的组织天才，使教师们称赞不已。
    今年二月三日，一万多少年儿童在南大草坪举行了献铁爱国大会。一辆辆装满废铁的车子，跟随着迎风飘扬的红旗穿过大街。大行宫小学的少年儿童队队员们抬着用一千多个铜元组成“献铁爱国”四个大字的牌匾，满面红光地迈步前进；夹道欢迎的人们深为感动，因为他们给南京人民带来了光荣。
    十二岁的少年队员林雪芸，在大会上代表全市少年儿童把历时三个月收集来的四万斤废铁献给政府，她说：“这是表示我们对祖国的热爱，对亲爱的毛主席的感谢！”
