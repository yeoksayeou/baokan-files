　　Celebrating the New Year
　　By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

　　With the victory of the Chinese people, I have spent many happy New Years. But this year's New Year—celebrated jointly with the heroic Korean people—is happier, more exciting, and more unforgettable than any New Year in my memory.

　　We arrived here on New Year's Eve. Because at five o'clock that afternoon, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had launched their third attack against the enemy on the vast central front, crossing the 38th parallel that night and fiercely attacking the American-Syngman Rhee bandit troops around Seoul. In order to rush to the front line and report on the heroic deeds of the anti-American warriors in a timely manner, we did not disturb the cadres of the village (里) People's Committee, but quietly stayed in the homes of several Korean villagers, preparing to continue our journey tomorrow night.

　　The next day at noon, as we were discussing how the people of our motherland were celebrating the New Year and guessing the content of the People's Daily's New Year's Day editorial, a Korean farmer in his forties entered the room. After saying "Comrades, you've worked hard" in Chinese, he shook hands with each of us. Many Koreans can speak this sentence in Chinese. He handed us a letter, written in Chinese, inviting us to join the Village People's Committee to celebrate the New Year at three o'clock in the afternoon. Since they already knew we were here, it was inconvenient to refuse, so we happily agreed.

　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, we were led to another mountain village. From afar, we saw more than a dozen Korean comrades waiting at the edge of the village. We quickened our pace and warmly shook hands with them, filled with exceptionally warm feelings. Although we didn't understand Korean and spoke different languages, our sincere friendship was unreservedly exchanged in the enthusiastic handshakes. Afterwards, Comrade Zheng Lücheng also arrived. He is Korean and came to China at a young age. He personally participated in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the four-year People's Liberation War, fighting alongside the Chinese people, and became a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the Party's cultivation, he became an outstanding musician, and his famous "Ode to Yan'an" and "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" are his works. This time, he came to Korea with Ouyang Shanzun, An E, Xin Daming and other literary and art workers to delve into the battlefield, collect materials, and use the weapon of art to strike at the American imperialist aggressors. They are preparing to jointly create a new type of opera about the heroic resistance of the Chinese and Korean people against American imperialist aggression. Before the Chinese People's Volunteers came to Korea, he followed the Korean People's Army, driving the American aggressors to Busan and Daegu. On this journey, he told us many stories about the heroic struggle of the Korean people against the enemy and the situation in Korea. We further expressed the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people through him, so we all call him the "volunteer of the Volunteers."

　　Through the "volunteer of the Volunteers," we learned more from our conversations with the hosts, like old friends, that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party, has been liberated from the poverty of slavery created by Japanese imperialism, implemented land reform, and achieved rapid development in industry and mining. This village—Anheung Village, Dingzhou County, North Pyongan Province—is an agricultural village. Their hard work resulted in an unprecedented bumper harvest last year (1950), with a yield of 2.7 dan of grain per mu. Cheng Changwan, chairman of the Village Committee of the Workers' Party, said: "Our good life has been completely destroyed by the American devils." Like all Korean villages, the American aggressors burned down their dwellings and grain, and killed seven peaceful residents. But no one succumbed to the enemy's brutality. Women carried their children and moved to the mountains, while men took up various weapons and fought the American aggressors day and night.

　　The Korean people's help and support for the Chinese People's Volunteers, and their friendship and love for the Chinese people, cannot be described in words. The Village People's Committee prepared an extremely sumptuous New Year's meal for us. In front of us was placed "Tteok," which Koreans only eat for major ceremonies or festivals. This is glutinous rice that is cooked and then pounded into the shape of Chinese New Year cake, covered with almonds or walnuts, sticky white sugar, and various dishes made of chicken, pork, and beef; there were also Korean spicy dishes. Koreans eat with spoons. The comrades of the Village Committee, afraid that we were not used to it, specially made chopsticks for us. – Having just suffered devastating destruction from the enemy, they still prepared such a lavish feast for us, and such deep affection made us feel very uneasy. We all stood up and toasted General Kim Il-sung, who is leading the heroic Korean people in resisting the common enemy of mankind and achieving great victories. Comrade Cheng Guiru, chairman of the Village People's Committee, returned the salute with the most solemn Korean etiquette and then toasted each of us. Comrade Cheng Changwan, chairman of the Village Committee of the Workers' Party, also toasted our Chairman Mao. Then we toasted together for the common victory and comradeship of the Chinese and Korean people. During the meal, we also received many New Year's cards from the Village People's Committee, various parties, and people's organizations. The New Year's card from the Village Committee of the Workers' Party read: "To the Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers: Wishing you victory in the New Year." The New Year's cards from the Farmers' Alliance Committee and the Homeland Defense Support Association read: "Wishing you health and strength in the New Year." We accepted these congratulations of noble friendship with moved and excited hearts.

　　Because we had to leave this place that night to rush to the front line south of the 38th parallel to fiercely attack the American bandits, our grand meeting had to end early. The comrades with cameras all wanted to capture this close friendship, so they took many photos as a permanent memorial. Before parting, after taking a group photo as a souvenir, the comrades of the Village Committee and various people's organizations escorted us to the edge of the village, repeatedly urging us to visit them again when we returned. We all said: "After driving the American imperialist aggressors out of Korea, we must come here again. At that time, we will drink heartily and celebrate the victory together!"

　　过年
    本报记者　田流
    随着中国人民的胜利，我度过许多快乐的新年。但今年的新年——同英勇的朝鲜人民共同欢度的新年，比记忆中的任何新年都过得更快乐，更兴奋，更使人经久不忘。
    我们是除夕之夜赶到这里的。因为当天下午五时，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军已在中部广阔的战线上，发起了对敌人的三次攻击，当夜便越过了“三八”线，正在汉城周围痛击着美李匪军。我们为了急速地赶到前线，及时报道抗美勇士们的英雄事绩，没有惊动里（村）人民委员会的干部们，便悄悄地在村边的几家朝鲜老乡家住下了，准备明天夜里继续前去。
    次日中午，我们正谈论着祖国人民怎样欢庆新年，猜测着人民日报的元旦社论的内容，一位四十来岁的朝鲜农民走进屋来。他用中国话说过“同志们，辛苦了”之后，便和我们一一握手。朝鲜人民有许多都会用中国话说这句话的。他递给我们一封信，信是用中文写的，邀我们下午三时去里人民委员会共庆新年。既然已知道我们来此，当然不便再加拒绝，就高兴地答应了。
    下午三时，我们被引往别一个山庄。远远的就望见十多位朝鲜同志在村边等候了，我们便紧走几步，怀着异常亲切的情感同他们热烈握手。虽然我们不懂朝鲜话，说着不同的语言，但我们诚挚的友谊，却在热烈的握手中无阻地交流着。随后郑律成同志也赶来了。他是朝鲜人，从小就到中国，八年抗日战争、四年人民解放战争，他都亲身参加过，和中国人民在一起共同战斗，并成为光荣的中国共产党党员。在党的培养下，他成了优秀的音乐家，有名的《延安颂》《中国人民解放军进行曲》就是他的作品。这次他同欧阳山尊、安娥、辛大明等文艺工作者来朝鲜，深入战地，搜集材料，以艺术的武器打击美帝侵略者。他们正准备共同创作关于中朝人民英勇反抗美帝侵略的新型歌剧。在中国人民志愿军未来朝鲜以前，他曾随朝鲜人民军，将美国侵略者打到釜山大邱。这次我们一路行军，他告诉了我们许多有关朝鲜人民英勇同敌斗争的故事和朝鲜的情况。我们通过他更表达了中朝人民的深厚友谊，因此我们都称他为“志愿军的志愿军”。
    通过“志愿军的志愿军”，我们同主人们像老朋友样的交谈中，进一步了解了在金日成首相及劳动党领导下的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，已经从日本帝国主义制造的奴隶的贫困中解放出来，实行了土地改革，工矿业得到了飞速的发展。这个村——平安北道定州郡安兴里，是个农业村。他们的辛勤劳动，使去年（一九五○年）得到了空前的丰收，一亩地收获了二石七斗粮食。劳动党里委员会委员长承昌万说：“我们的好生活，被美国鬼子彻底破坏了。”美国侵略者像对待朝鲜一切乡村一样，烧毁了他们的住室和粮食，杀死了七个和平居民。但没有一个人在敌人的残暴面前屈服，妇女们背着孩子转移到山里去，男人们则拿起各种武器，不分昼夜地打击着美国侵略者。
    朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的帮助和拥护，对中国人民的友谊和热爱是无法以语言形容的。里人民委员会为我们备下了极其丰美的年餐。在我们面前摆开来的有朝鲜人举行大礼或过盛节时才吃的“打糕”。这是将糯米煮熟后，再敲打成中国的年糕状，上面敷有杏仁或核桃仁，黏白糖，有鸡、猪、牛肉作成的各种各样的菜蔬；还有朝鲜的辣菜。朝鲜人民吃饭是用勺子的。里委员会的同志们怕我们不习惯，还专为我们作了筷子。——在刚刚遭受了敌人毁灭性的破坏之后，仍为我们筹备了这样丰盛的筵席，如此丰情盛意使我们感到老大不安。我们一齐站起来，为领导着英勇的朝鲜人民抗击人类公敌并获得伟大胜利的金日成将军干杯致敬。里人民委员长承龟汝同志，以朝鲜最庄重的礼节还礼后，同我们一一碰杯。劳动党里委员会委员长承昌万同志也为我们的毛主席干杯。而后我们共同为中朝人民的共同胜利和战友之谊干杯。席间，我们还接到了好多贺年信，这是里人民委员会、各党派和人民团体送来的。劳动党里委员会的贺信。写着：“中国人民志愿军同志：祝新年胜利。”农民同盟委员会和祖国保卫后援会的贺信则写着：“新年健强祝福。”我们以感动兴奋的心情，接受了这高贵的友谊的祝贺。
    因为我们当天夜里还要离开此地，赶赴正在“三八”线以南痛击美寇的前线去，我们的盛会不得不赶早结束。带着照像机的同志，都要把这亲密无间的友谊摄入镜头，因此拍了许多照，作为永久的纪念。临别时共同摄影留念后，里委员会和各人民团体的同志们直送到村外，一再叮咛相邀，回来时再来看他们。我们都说：“把美帝国主义侵略军赶出朝鲜后，一定要再到这里来，那时要开怀畅饮，共庆胜利！”
