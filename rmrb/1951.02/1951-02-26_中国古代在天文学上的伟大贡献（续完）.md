Great Contributions of Ancient China to Astronomy (Continued)
　　Zhu Kezhen

The full names of the Twenty-Eight Mansions were seen in books of the Qin and Han dynasties, such as *Lüshi Chunqiu*, *Yue Ling* in *Book of Rites*, *Records of the Grand Historian*, and *Huainanzi*, but the *Book of Songs* already contains the names of several constellations such as Fire, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Roof, Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Ox, and Weaver Girl. The Twenty-Eight Mansions were probably already in use in the early Zhou Dynasty. By the mid-Warring States period, Gan Gong of Chu and Shi Shen of Wei wrote *Gan Shi Xing Jing*. The book records the ecliptic degrees and the degrees from the North Pole of one hundred and twenty fixed stars. From these figures, it can be determined that these positions were measured in the mid-Warring States period, that is, around 350-360 BC. The earliest Western star catalog is Ptolemy's star catalog, which was completed in the 2nd century AD, and is a copy of the observations of Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC. It contains the positions of one thousand and twenty fixed stars. Although the number of stars recorded in *Gan Shi Xing Jing* is smaller, the observation date is 200 years earlier, and the accuracy is comparable. By the time of Zhang Heng in the Eastern Han Dynasty, who was contemporary with Ptolemy, he already knew that "there are 124 officials inside and outside the celestial sphere that are always visible, 320 that can be named, totaling 2,500 stars, and the observations of seafarers have not been recorded." Zhang Heng created the theory of the celestial sphere. He made a celestial sphere instrument, established the ecliptic and celestial equator, which intersect at twenty-four degrees. He divided the globe into 365 and a quarter degrees. He established the north and south poles. He arranged the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the sun, the moon, and the five planets, and rotated them with a water clock. The timing of when a star begins to rise, when it reaches its meridian, and when it sets, was completely consistent with reality. Its sophistication was unprecedented both domestically and abroad. Zhang Heng not only had great achievements in astronomy, but he also invented the seismograph. At the same time, he was also a remarkable writer and artist. After his death, Cui Yuan wrote an inscription for him, saying that he "exhausted the principles of heaven and earth through calculation, and his creations rivaled the Creator." Undoubtedly, a person like Zhang Heng would be a rare talent in any era and in any country.

During the two Han Dynasties, there were land routes between our country and the Western Regions. After the Jin Dynasty, sea routes became smooth, and communication with India, Arabia, and Persia became frequent. Therefore, in the second period, from the Six Dynasties to the Tang Dynasty, a period of six hundred years, our cultural exchanges with India and Arabia were very prosperous. We absorbed a lot of experience from India and Arabia in astronomy, but the greatest achievements in astronomy during this period were still our own creations. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Jin (around 330 AD), Yu Xi compared the positions of ancient stars with those of his time and found that they were different, and discovered the precession of the equinoxes, determining that the vernal equinox point would shift westward by one degree on the ecliptic every fifty years. Although this was four hundred and fifty to six hundred years later than Hipparchus' discovery in the West, it was more precise than Hipparchus' estimate of one degree per century. By the early 7th century, Liu Zhuo of the Sui Dynasty determined the precession of the equinoxes to be one degree every seventy-five years, which was very close to the actual value. However, the West still adhered to the old saying of one degree per century at the same time.

In the mid-6th century, Zhang Zixin of the Northern Qi Dynasty, because of fleeing from the chaos of war, went to an island and spent thirty years exclusively measuring the sun, moon, and five planets with a celestial sphere instrument. He discovered the speed of the sun's movement throughout the year and the laws of solar and lunar eclipses. He said, "The sun moves slowly after the vernal equinox and quickly after the autumnal equinox. If the conjunction of the moon and the sun is within the ecliptic, there will be a solar eclipse; if it is outside the ecliptic, there will be no eclipse even if they intersect. If the full moon coincides with the intersection, there will be an eclipse, regardless of whether it is inside or outside." These two inventions of Zhang Zixin were very helpful for predicting solar eclipses. During the reign of Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty, the monk Yi Xing and the craftsman Liang Lingzan made a copper ecliptic sphere to measure the longitude and latitude of stars, and discovered an important fact, that is, compared with the ancient times, the positions of the stars at that time were different, not only the positions on the celestial equator and the degrees of distance from the poles were different due to the precession of the equinoxes, but also the positions on the ecliptic were different. For example, the constellation Jianxing was half a degree north of the ecliptic in ancient times, but was measured to be four and a half degrees north of the ecliptic during the Kaiyuan era. The ecliptic positions of more than ten other stars such as Tianguan, Tianzun, Xuliang, and Changyuan were also different from those in ancient times. If further inferences are made from this, it can be known that the positions of the fixed stars themselves are moving in the sky. This movement can be called the proper motion of stars. However, Yi Xing did not use such a term, he only said, "The degrees of the stars in the ancient calendars and measured by Luo Xiahong of the Han Dynasty and others are different in distance, but the body of the Twenty-Eight Mansions remains unchanged." The proper motion of stars was not discovered in the West until the early 18th century by Halley in England. During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, we also did a major thing in astronomy, that is, measuring the length of one degree of the meridian. The size of the Earth is something that people eagerly want to know. As the saying goes: "Not knowing the height of the sky, or the thickness of the earth." It is also a basic number in astronomy. The ancient Greeks spent a lot of effort studying this issue. Because they had a good foundation in geometry, they were able to obtain relatively accurate results. At the end of the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes in Alexandria, Egypt, measured the height of the sun at noon on the summer solstice, and from this angle and the distance of Alexandria from the Tropic of Cancer, he calculated that the Earth's circumference was 250,000 Egyptian miles, which was only 18% more than the actual value. Although this was quite accurate, it was still an estimate. Since the Han Dynasty, Chinese astronomers have been misled by the idealist school of the *Zhoubi Suanjing*. The *Zhoubi Suanjing* attributed its theory to the Duke of Zhou, believing that the sky was round and the earth was square, and that the shadow of the sundial differed by one inch per thousand miles. From the Han to the Sui Dynasties, no one could overthrow this absurd theory, which affected the progress of our astronomy. Liu Zhuo of the Sui Dynasty was the first to use facts to prove the unreliability of the *Zhoubi's* claim that the shadow differed by one inch per thousand miles. In his memorial to Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, he said: "Now, in the state of Jiaozhou, there is no shadow to the north of the sundial. Counting that it is more than ten thousand miles south of the place where the sun can be seen overhead, it is not actually one inch per thousand miles... Please select a hydraulic engineer and mathematicians to measure several hundred miles of flat land in Henan and Hebei, making sure the north-south direction is accurate. Determine the time with a water clock and level the land with a rope. Measure the shadows on the same day when the seasons change. Obtain the rate of difference, and the distance can be known. Then the shape of the earth will be revealed, and the numbers of celestial phenomena will be knowable." Liu Zhuo's progressive theory was to be implemented by Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, but Emperor Yang did not listen. This matter was put aside for a hundred years. Finally, in the twelfth year of Kaiyuan in the Tang Dynasty (725 AD), Liu Zhuo's proposal was realized. The Tai Shi Jian (Director of the Imperial Observatory) Nan Gongshuo selected flat land in Henan, and used water levels and ropes to measure the distance. Starting from Huazhou north of the Yellow River, passing through Bianzhou, Xuzhou, and reaching Yuzhou. He also measured the latitude of Huazhou, Kaifeng, Fugou, and Shangcai. As a result, it was concluded that the length of one degree of the meridian was 351 li and 80 bu (the Tang Dynasty used 300 bu as one li). This was the world's first actual measurement of the length of the meridian. Although the result was not so accurate, it was a great progress in method. The earliest meridian measurement in the West was carried out by the Muslim king Al-Ma'mun in Mesopotamia in 814 AD, nearly ninety years after Nan Gongshuo's measurement. Although there is no explicit record of this meridian determination in the Tang Dynasty history, the initiator was undoubtedly Yi Xing. Yi Xing's secular surname was Zhang, and his given name was Sui. He was the grandson of Duke Jin of Tan, the governor of Xiangzhou in the early Tang Dynasty. He studied astronomy with the Taoist Yin Chong, and learned Sanskrit calendar from the monk Pujue. However, the Dayan Calendar created by Yi Xing was much better than the Jiu Zhi Calendar of the Indian Gautam Siddha in the early Tang Dynasty. This shows that our ancient astronomers, while absorbing foreign experience, were constantly creating. Yi Xing was also an outstanding talent in the history of astronomy. Ouyang Xiu's *New Book of Tang* did not write a biography for him. Even the biography of Yi Xing in the *Old Book of Tang* is extremely short. This is all because he was an outsider, a monk. Fortunately, we can still see Yi Xing's life's work and doctrines in the astronomical records. The feudal concept of ancient Chinese scholar-officials has buried many true talents.

In the third period, from the Five Dynasties to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, also six hundred years, we continued to make many brilliant contributions to astronomy. The greatest discovery in this period was the application of the compass to navigation. The compass is not usually regarded as an astronomical instrument, but the ancient compass was closely related to astronomy. The mariner's compass at sea has the same function as stars and the sun. The earliest record of the compass's efficacy is found in the writings of an excellent astronomer, Shen Kuo of the Northern Song Dynasty's *Dream Pool Essays*. *Dream Pool Essays* said that the magnetic needle can point south and slightly east, and described four methods of how to make the magnetic needle point south. But it did not mention its application to navigation. Less than twenty-five years after Shen Kuo's death, in the first year of Xuanhe of the Northern Song Dynasty (1119 AD), Zhu Yu wrote *Pingzhou Ketan*, recording the Guangzhou foreign quarter's shipping trade. Among them was the statement "Ship masters...observe the stars at night, observe the sun during the day, and observe the compass in cloudy weather," indicating that the compass was commonly used for navigation at that time. Xia Deren, former professor of Chinese at Columbia University in the United States, mistakenly quoted Zhu Yu's words in *Pingzhou Ketan*, saying that although the compass was discovered in China, the use of the compass for navigation was passed down from Arabia. He misunderstood that all the ships that Chinese merchants traveled on at that time were foreign ships. George Sarton, professor at Harvard University, echoed his statement in *History of Science*, which is a case of misinterpreting information based on limited understanding. They do not know that before the Tang Dynasty, Chinese maritime travelers such as Faxian and Yijing, who went to India to seek Buddhist scriptures, generally traveled on foreign ships. But after the Tang Dynasty, Chinese ships had greatly improved, and the structure of the ships and the technology of navigation were superior to those of Persia and Arabia. Even foreigners traveled on Chinese ships. In the fifth year of Xuanhe, the Northern Song Dynasty wanted to establish friendly relations with Goryeo (Korea), and sent Xu Jing as an envoy to Goryeo, where he stayed for more than a month. After returning to China, he wrote *Xuanhe Fengshi Goryeo Tu Jing*, presented to Emperor Huizong. It vividly described how the floating needle compass was used in storms. Xu Jing was the ambassador sent to Goryeo at that time. He departed from Ningbo, with two Shenzhou ships and six passenger ships. What he recorded was all his personal experiences. The fact that the application of the compass to navigation was a Chinese discovery is undoubtedly certain. The earliest Western books on compass navigation appeared in the early 13th century, about one hundred years after *Pingzhou Ketan* and *Goryeo Tu Jing*.

Shen Kuo was a hard-working scientist with a creative and striving spirit in our history. In order to determine the location of the North Pole in the sky, he spent more than three months, observing every night, drawing more than two hundred diagrams, before realizing that the North Pole was still more than three degrees away from Polaris at that time. Although winter and summer days and nights are all said to be twenty-four hours, they are not all the same length. In winter, the Earth is closer to the perihelion, so it moves faster. In summer, it is closer to the aphelion, so it moves slower. In ancient China, time was measured by clepsydras. In the past, officials in charge of the calendar thought that the water was viscous in winter, so it flowed slowly. In summer, the water flowed more easily, so it flowed faster. It was not until Shen Kuo realized that the speed of the celestial movement was related to this. Shen Kuo advocated abandoning all previous theories about the calendar, determining the months by solar terms, completely making it a solar calendar, regardless of the phases of the moon, and completely removing leap months. He said, "The best way to create a calendar now is to use the twelve solar terms as a year. Let the day of the Beginning of Spring be the first day of the first month of spring, and the Awakening of Insects be the first day of the second month of spring. In this way, the seasons will always be correct." Such a thorough solar calendar is more ideal than the current calendar. The time for farmers to plow in spring, sow in summer, harvest in autumn, and store in winter all depends on the seasons. The calendar created by Shen Kuo is the most suitable for the needs of the common people. The New Year's Day of the current Gregorian calendar has no meaning for human life or for the seasons. Moreover, the months are of unequal lengths, and the arrangement of the seasons has no regularity. This is entirely a system left over from the Roman Empire. But at that time, Shen Kuo's proposal was met with fierce attacks. Twenty years ago, Shaw, the director of the British Meteorological Bureau, had the same plan, but he placed New Year's Day on November 6th of the Gregorian calendar, which is the Chinese Beginning of Winter. He called his calendar the agricultural calendar. Now, the British Meteorological Bureau uses Shaw's agricultural calendar to statistically analyze agricultural climate and production. Shen Kuo said: "My theory of this calendar will especially invite strange anger and abuse, but in the future, there will definitely be people who will use my theory." He did not expect that nine hundred years later, his calendar would be implemented in Britain.

During the Yuan Dynasty, the Chinese territory expanded to Eastern Europe and included the Western Regions. Therefore, during this period, our astronomy and calendar learned a lot from the Western Regions. In the fourth year of Emperor Shizu of Yuan (1267 AD), the Persian astronomer Jamal al-Din presented instruments from the Western Regions and created the Wan Nian Li (Ten Thousand Year Calendar). But soon after, Guo Shoujing created the Shoushi Li (Season-Granting Calendar), using 365.2425 days as a year, which differed from the actual period of the Earth's orbit around the sun by only 26 seconds; the same as the cycle of the Gregorian calendar currently used in the world. But the Shoushi Li was already in use in the eighteenth year of Emperor Shizu of Yuan (1281 AD), while the West did not start issuing the Gregorian calendar until 1582. The Gregorian calendar was three hundred years later than the Shoushi Li. Guo Shoujing also manufactured thirteen kinds of instruments such as the Simplified Instrument, the Instrument for Observing the Pole Star, the Linglong Instrument, and the Celestial Sphere, which were more ingenious and precise than those of his predecessors. The 1947 edition of the *Encyclopedia Britannica* also acknowledges that Guo Shoujing's Simplified Instrument and other instruments were invented three hundred years earlier than similar instruments invented by the Western Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Guo Shoujing also initiated a nationwide survey of latitude. Counting from Goryeo in the east, to Liangzhou, Chengdu, and Kunming in the west, and to Tiele in the north, there were twenty-seven locations, and twenty-two observatories were established. This can be called the most prosperous era of ancient Chinese astronomy.

From Guo Shoujing in the Yuan Dynasty to Xu Guangqi in the late Ming Dynasty, for three hundred years, Chinese astronomy made no progress. This can be seen from Xu Guangqi's memorial on solar eclipses in the fifth year of Chongzhen in the Ming Dynasty. He said: "From the Han to the Sui Dynasties, there were a total of 293 solar eclipses. Of these, 77 were on the last day of the month, 3 were on the day before the last day, and 3 were on the second day of the month. It was that sparse. From the Tang to the Five Dynasties, there were a total of 110 eclipses. Of these, 1 was on the last day of the month, 1 was on the second day of the month, and 1 was on the third day of the month. It was slightly more accurate. During the Song Dynasty with 148 eclipses none were on the last day, it was yet more accurate. Still, there were 13 eclipses that were predicted but did not occur. During the Yuan Dynasty with 45 eclipses, none were on the last day, but there was still 1 that was predicted but did not occur, 1 that occurred but was not predicted, and 1 that was recorded as occurring during the day but actually occurred at night. It is still being followed and used today. How can we avoid this? Shoujing's method has been used for 300 years, and the world commonly attributes it to his surpassing previous generations. The business of high and profound endless matters must be accumulated over generations and times to gradually see clues. Therefore, from the Han Dynasty to the present, 1,500 years, there have been only 13 families who have formulated laws. It takes decades or hundreds of years to compare the skill and ingenuity. It cannot be done by the mind or effort of one person. Shoujing collected the great achievements of the past, added his own meticulous thinking and extensive measurements, so the difference was only four or five quarters of an hour. Compared with previous generations, it was indeed more accurate. If Shoujing were to be reborn in this world and wanted to be more precise, it would be difficult to achieve without painstaking effort and years of dedication."

Predicting solar eclipses has always been regarded as a major event in Chinese dynasties. The advancement of solar eclipse prediction technology can very well represent the advancement of astronomy. Our astronomy has progressed from the Han to the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, but why did it stagnate in the Ming Dynasty, sticking to the old methods? Ruan Yuan of the Qing Dynasty, in his *Chou Ren Zhuan* (Biographies of Astronomers and Mathematicians), commented on the achievements of the Ming Dynasty people: "The scholars and officials of the Ming Dynasty mostly admired emptiness and shallowness." He also said, "The study of mathematics in the Ming Dynasty declined, and few people studied it." Probably the promotion of the imperial examination in the Ming Dynasty, which used eight-legged essays to select talents, caused the general intellectuals to spend their time on mysterious and abstruse eight-legged essays, which was a major reason. Gu Yanwu of the late Ming Dynasty said, "The harm of eight-legged essays is greater than the burning of books," which is not an exaggeration. When the Manchu Qing Dynasty feared the ethnic revolution of the Han people, they used eight-legged essays as a tool to deceive the people. Therefore, throughout the Qing Dynasty, we did not have any creations in astronomy. During the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty, the Italian Christopher Columbus used the compass to discover the New World, which led to the prosperity of industry and commerce in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, indirectly stimulating the rise of modern science. In the era of Xu Guangqi, our astronomy was not much worse than that of the West. Galileo, who was contemporary with Xu Guangqi, discovered the telescope, greatly expanding the scope of astronomers' exploration of the sky, and making our achievements in astronomy fall far behind. However, when we look back at the great creations of Zhang Heng, Yu Xi, Liu Zhuo, Yi Xing, and Shen Kuo before Guo Shoujing, as well as the accumulated labor achievements of thousands of astronomical workers over time, we can be confident that under the leadership of the cultural and educational policies promoted by the People's Government, loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and loving public property, given sufficient time, our astronomy, like other sciences, will surely have more brilliant achievements.

　　中国古代在天文学上的伟大贡献（续完）
　　竺可桢
    二十八宿全部名称，虽到秦汉时代的吕氏春秋，礼记月令，史记天官书，淮南子等书里才看到，可是诗经里已经有火、箕、斗、定、昴、毕、参、牵牛、织女、诸宿之名。大概在周朝初年已经应用二十八宿。到战国中期，楚人甘公、魏人石申，著有甘石星经。书中载有一百二十个恒星黄道度数和距北极的度数，从这些数目，可以断定这位置是战国中叶，即公元前三百五六十年所测定。西方最早的恒星表要算多禄米的恒星表，在公元后二世纪所成，系抄录公历纪元前二世纪希普克斯观测的结果。其中载有一千零二十个恒星的位置。甘石星经所载的星数虽较少，但观测年代却早了二百年，而且精密程度也不相上下。到了东汉和多禄米同时的张衡，已知道“中外之官，常明者百有二十四，可名者三百二十，为星二千五百，而海人之占未存焉”。张衡创浑天学说。作浑天仪，立黄赤二道，相交成二十四度。分全球为三百六十五度四分度之一。立南北二极。布置二十八宿及日月五星，以漏水转之。某星始出，某星方中，某星今没，和实际完全一样。其精巧为以前中外所未有。张衡不但对于天文有很好的成就，他还发明了候风地动仪。同时他也是有数的文学家和艺术家。他死后崔瑗为之撰碑，说他“数术穷天地，制作侔造化”。无疑地像张衡这样人，在任何时代，任何国家，统可成为一个凤毛麟角的人物。
    在两汉的时候，我国和西域诸国陆路上有来往。到了晋朝以后，海路畅通，和印度大食波斯交通频繁。所以在第二个时期从六朝到唐六百年中，我们和印度大食间的文化交流是很盛的。我们天文学从印度大食吸取了不少经验，可是在这个时期天文学上最大的成就，仍是我们自己的创造。在晋成帝时候（公历三百三十年左右）虞喜比较古代星宿位置与当时不同，发现了岁差，定出每五十年春分点在黄道上要西移一度。这虽比西洋希普克斯的发现要迟到四百五六十年，但却比希普克斯的每百年差一度的估计为精密。到七世纪初隋朝刘焯定岁差为七十五年差一度。则与实际已相差极近。但西洋同时尚牢守百年差一度的旧说。
    在六世纪中，北齐的张子信，因为避乱到海岛上，化三十年工夫专以浑仪测候日月五星。发现一年中太阳的行动快慢，和日月蚀的规律。他说“日行在春分后则迟，秋分后则速。合朔月在日道里则日食，若在日道外虽交不亏。月望值交则亏，不问表里”。张子信这两种发明，于预告日蚀大有裨益。到唐明皇时代，僧一行和工人梁令瓒造黄道铜浑仪，以测量星宿的经纬度，发现了一桩重要事实，即把当时的星宿位置和古代相比，不但赤道上位置和离极度数，因为岁差的关系有不同。而且黄道上位置亦有不同。如建星古在黄道北半度，开元时测得在黄道北四度半。其余还有天关、天尊、虚梁、长垣等十余星其黄道位置已统和古代有异。若从此作进一步的推断，可以知道恒星本身在天上的位置在移动。此种移动可称为恒星本动。不过一行并没有用这类名称，他只说“古历星度及汉落下闳等所测，其星距远近不同，但二十八宿之体不变”。恒星本动在西洋到十八世纪初叶英国哈雷才发现的。在唐开元的时候，我们在天文学上还做过一件大事，即是量子午线一度的长短。地球的大小，是人生渴想欲知的一件事。俗语说：“不知天之高，地之厚”。同时也是天文学上一个基本数字。关于这个问题，古代希腊人很费一番心思来研究。因为他们几何学已有很好的根底，所以能得到相当精确的结果。在公历纪元前三世纪末，伊拉托思托尼在埃及亚力山大城，于夏至日中午测量太阳的高度，从这角度和亚力山大城离开北回归线的距离，他便算出地球一周是二十五万埃及里，比实际只多了百分之十八。这虽相当精确，总还是一个估计。我国从汉代以来，天文学家被周髀算经的唯心学派所误。周髀假托周公之说，以为天圆地方，日晷之影，千里差一寸，从汉到隋没有人能推翻这荒谬的理论，影响了我们天文学的进步。隋朝的刘焯是第一个人用事实来证明周髀影千里差一寸之不可靠。他上隋炀帝的书里说：“今交爱之州，表北无影，计无万里南过戴日，是千里一寸，非其实差。………………请一水工并解算术士，取河南北平地之所，可量数百里，南北使正。审时以漏，平地以绳。随气至分，同日度影。得其差率，里即可知。则天地无所匿其形，辰象无所逃其数”。刘焯这种进步的理论要隋炀帝实行，隋炀帝不听。这事搁了一百年，到唐开元十二年，（公历七二五年）刘焯的主张，终于实现了。太史监南宫说择河南平地，以水准绳墨引度距离。从黄河以北的滑州起经汴州，许州，直到豫州。并量了滑州、开封、扶沟、上蔡四个地方的纬度。结果得出子午线一度之长是三百五十一里八十步（唐以三百步为里）。这是世界第一次实测子午线的长度。结果虽并不那么精确，可是在方法上是一个极大进步。西洋最早子午线的测量，是回教王阿尔曼孟于公历八一四年在美索伯达米亚地方举行的，已在南宫说的测量之后几九十年了。这次子午线的测定，唐史虽无明文，但主动者，无疑是一行。一行俗姓张名遂，是唐初襄州都督郯国公谨之孙。曾在道士尹崇那边学天文，并在沙门普寂那边学梵历。但一行创的大衍历，却比唐初印度人瞿昙悉达的九执历高明得多。这可知我们古代天文学家一边吸取外国的经验，一边却在不绝的创造。一行在天文史上亦是一位杰出的人才。欧阳修新唐史竟不为之立传。即旧唐书一行传亦极短略。统是因为他是方外，是一个僧人。幸而在天文志上我们还能看到一行平生的工作和学说，我国古代士大夫这种封建的观念，不知道埋没了多少真才。
    在第三个时期即从五代到元明亦是六百年，我们在天文学上继续有不少光辉的贡献。在这个时期我们最伟大的发现是指南针之应用于航海。普通不把指南针当作一种天文学上的器械，但是古代指南针和天文学很有关系。航海上罗盘却和星宿太阳有一样的功用。讲指南针功效最早的纪录，见之于一位优秀天文家的著作中，即是北宋沈括的梦溪笔谈。笔谈说磁针能指南且微向东，以及四种如何能使磁针指南的方法。但并没讲到应用于航海。沈括死后不到二十五年即北宋宣和元年（公历一一一九年）朱彧作萍州可谈，记广州蕃坊市舶。其中有“舟师……夜则观星，昼则观日，阴晦观指南针”等语，可知那时指南针用以航海已极普通。美国哥伦比亚大学前中文教授夏德著中国古代史，误引朱彧萍州可谈之言，说指南针虽是中国发现，而利用罗盘航海却传自阿拉伯。他误会了那时中国来往商人所坐的船全是外国船。哈佛大学教授乔治沙汤著世界科学史，更附和其说，真所谓一知半解以误传误。他们不知道在唐朝以前中国人海上来往如法显、义净，赴印度求经概坐外国船。但唐以后，中国船已大有进步，船只结构和驾驶技术统在波斯大食之上，即外国人来往亦坐中国船了。宣和五年北宋要和高丽结好，派徐竞出使高丽，留了一个多月。回国后，写宣和奉使高丽图经上陈徽宗。其中很生动地讲到指南浮针如何在风暴中应用着。徐竞是那时派往高丽的大使，他去时从宁波出发，有神舟二只，客舟六只。他所记的尽是亲身经历之谈。指南针应用于航海为中国之发现，乃确无可疑的一桩事。西洋讲罗盘航海最早的书籍见于十三世纪初，在萍州可谈和高丽图经之后约一百年。
    沈括是我们历史上一位勤劳而富于创造精神和奋斗精神的科学工作者。他为了测定天空北极所在，化了三个多月工夫，夜夜观测，画了二百多张图，方知那时北极离开极星尚三度有余。冬夏昼夜虽均称二十四小时，并非长短全同，冬天地球靠近近日点，所以走得快。夏天靠近远日点，所以走得慢。中国古代以刻漏量时间，从前历官以为冬月水涩，所以走得慢。夏月水利，所以走得快，到了沈括才知道是天运有迟速的关系。沈括于历法主张抛弃一切前人之说，以节气定月，彻底为阳历，不管月亮的朔望，把闰月完全去掉。他说“今为术莫若用十二月气为一年。直之立春之日为孟春之一日，惊蛰为仲春之一日，如此则四时之气常正”。这样彻底的一个阳历较现行历法合乎理想。农夫春耕夏种秋收冬藏的时间，统要看季节而定。沈括所创的历是最合老百姓所需要的。现行阳历的元旦，于人生于天时统无任何意义。而且月份的大小参差不齐，季节的按排毫无规律。这完全是罗马皇帝时代遗留下来的一种制度。但在当时，沈括这种主张是很受人的疯狂攻击的。二十年前英国气象局局长萧讷伯有同样的计划，不过他把元旦放在阳历的十一月六号，即中国的立冬节。称其历为农历。到如今英国气象局统计农业气候和生产，是用萧讷伯农历的。沈括说：“予今此历论，尤当取怪怒攻骂，然异时必有用予之说者”。他料想不到九百年以后他的历会在英国行起来了。
    元朝的时候，中国版图扩充到了东欧，把西域各国也包括在内。所以在这时期，我们的天文学和历学又从西域诸国吸取了不少经验。元世祖至元四年波斯人札马鲁丁进西域仪象，并造万年历。但不久郭守敬创立授时历，以三六五·二四二五天为一岁，和实际地球绕太阳一周的周期只差二十六秒；与目前世界所用格里哥莱历一岁周期相同。但授时历在元至元十八年（公历一二八一年）已应用，西洋则到一五八二年才开始颁发。格里哥莱历比授时历要迟三百年。郭守敬又制造了简仪，候极仪，玲珑仪，浑天象等十三种仪器，机巧精密胜过前人。一九四七年版大英百科全书，也承认郭守敬所制简仪等器，早于西洋丹麦天文家太谷氏所发明同样仪器计凡三百年。郭守敬又发起全国测量纬度的大事业。计东起高丽，西至凉州、成都、昆明，北至铁勒，凡二十七个地点，并立了二十二个测候所。这可称为中国古代天文学极盛时代。
    从元郭守敬到明末徐光启三百年间，中国天文学无若何的进步。这可从明崇祯五年徐光启日食奏议中看出来。他说：“日食自汉至隋凡二百九十三。而食于晦日者七十七，晦前一日者三，初二者三，其疏如此。唐至五代凡一百一十。而食于晦者一，初二者一，初三者一，稍密矣。宋凡一百四十八。则无晦日，更密。犹有推食而不食者十三。元凡四十五，亦无晦食，犹有推食而不食者一，食而失推者一，夜食而书昼者一。至加时先后，至四五刻，当其时已然。至今遵用，安能免此。乃守敬之法，三百年来，世共推归，以为度越前代何也。高远无穷之事，必积世累时，乃稍见端倪。故汉至今千五百岁，立法者仅十有三家。盖于数十百年间一较工拙，非一人之心思知力所能黾勉者也。守敬集前古之大成，加以精思广测，故所差仅四五刻。比于前代，洵为密矣。若使守敬复生今世，欲更求精密，计非苦心极力，假以数年恐未易得。”
    预告日食，在中国历代统当作一桩大事。预告日蚀技术的进步，很可以代表天文学的进步。我们天文学从两汉经唐宋元各时代统代有进步，为什么到明朝却会墨守旧法，停顿下来呢？清阮元作畴人传评量明朝人的成就说“明季士大夫率以空疏相尚，”又说“明代算学陵替习之者鲜”。大概明朝提倡科举，以八股文取士，使一般知识分子统把时间化在玄而又玄的八股文上，是一个大原因。明末顾炎武说：“八股之害，甚于焚书”，并不言之过甚。到满清怕汉族的民族革命，更要利用八股文来做欺骗人民的工具，所以终清的一代，我们在天文学上却没有什么创造。在明弘治年间意大利人哥伦布利用指南针发现了新大陆，引起了西洋十六七世纪时代工商业的繁盛，间接刺戟近代科学的兴起。在徐光启时代我们的天文学并不比西洋差多少，和徐光启同时的伽利略发现了天文镜，大大的推广了天文学家天空探视的范围，遂使我们在天文学的成就，望尘莫及。但是我们回顾郭守敬以前张衡、虞喜、刘焯、一行、沈括等的伟大创造以及千万天文工作人员积时累世的劳动成绩，我们很可以自信在人民政府所提倡爱祖国、爱人民，爱劳动，爱科学，爱公物的文教政策领导之下，给以相当的时间，我们的天文学，和旁的科学一样，必会有更灿烂光辉的成就。
