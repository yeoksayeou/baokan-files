　　After this newspaper published the People's Supervision Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government's handling of Beijing Coal and Iron Company manager Lin Jie's violation of policy for personal gain on December 21, 1950, readers Wang Jinlin, Lu Wangzhi, Yu Yi, Chu Yuanxi and others raised different opinions, believing that the People's Supervision Committee's punishment of Lin Jie was too lenient. After these opinions were published in this newspaper or directly forwarded to the People's Supervision Committee, the People's Supervision Committee seriously studied them and, together with relevant departments, invited Lu Wangzhi and others to hold a forum. After discussion, everyone reached a consensus. The People's Supervision Committee of the State Administration Council's respect for the letters from the masses, serious handling of the problems reflected by the masses, and their excellent work style of seeking truth from facts and conducting investigations and research are worthy of study by government organs and all staff at all levels.

　　关于林洁处分问题的读者来信及解决经过（编者按）
    一九五○年十二月二十一日，本报发表了中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会处理北京煤铁公司经理林洁违反政策营私图利的结果后，读者王金林、陆望之、于一、储元熹等即提出不同意见，认为人民监察委员会对林洁的处分过轻。这些意见经本报发表或直接转给人民监察委员会后，人民监察委员会即认真加以研究，并会同有关部门，邀请陆望之等举行座谈会，经过讨论，大家得出了一致的意见。政务院人民监察委员会这种尊重群众来信，认真处理群众反映的问题以及他们所表现的实事求是调查研究的优良作风，值得我们各级政府机关和一切工作人员学习。
