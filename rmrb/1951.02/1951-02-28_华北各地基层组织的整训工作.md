　　The rectification work of the grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in North China, which began in mid-November last year, has achieved great results. As of now, more than 210,000 party members in the five provinces of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been trained. More than 6,900 rural branches in the four provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, Hebei, and Pingyuan have been rectified. In Shanxi Province alone, more than 43,800 party members have received intensive training, and more than 2,500 rural branches have been rectified.

　　The purpose of this rectification of grassroots organizations of the CCP in North China is to improve the political consciousness of party members, overcome commandism, promote democratic work style, consolidate and purify the party organization, and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the branches to meet the needs of the new situation. The rectification is carried out in two steps: The first step – intensive training of party members, generally conducted at the county level, with each branch sending five to eight party members in batches to the county for intensive training, each session lasting about half a month. The training content includes four items: anti-American and patriotic current affairs education, mass line, production policy, and basic knowledge of the Party. Full-time cadres are responsible for the training, and the county party committee takes personal charge. The training methods generally involve explaining and discussing in combination with checking work, based on the ideological situation of the party members. During the process, methods such as enlightening reports, group deliberation, typical speeches, general discussions, answering questions, and summarizing are used to improve the ideological awareness of party members by comparing good and bad examples with vivid examples of real people and events.

　　The ideological and political level of party members who have been trained has been significantly improved. In particular, anti-American and patriotic current affairs education has played a significant role in enhancing the enthusiasm and fighting will of party members. After studying, many party members have gained a clearer understanding of the true face of American imperialism and the great significance of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and the country, and have strengthened their understanding of internationalism and patriotism. They unanimously stated that they would go back and lead the peasant masses to do a good job in production, support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and strengthen national defense. On the issue of work style, after education on the mass line and the mass viewpoint, there has also been a great improvement. The training class in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, used the leadership method of labor model Zhang Zhiquan from Chizhai Village as an example to illustrate the benefits of the mass line leadership method, and another example to illustrate the harm of the coercive command style. Such a comparison of good and bad examples, after enlightenment and discussion, criticized some party members' erroneous ideas such as "tasks cannot be completed without coercion" and "the masses are backward and coercion is necessary," enabling the trained party members to recognize and appreciate the leadership method of the mass line. The work style of the trained party cadres has significantly changed in the autumn tax collection and winter production. In the education on production direction and production policy, the erroneous ideas of some party members, such as "fear of standing out" and unwillingness to participate in and lead mutual aid organizations, have been further eliminated. The basic knowledge education of the Party enabled party members to have a basic understanding of the Party program and constitution.

　　The second step of the rectification work in various places – the rectification of branches – is generally carried out with trained party members as the backbone, led by county and district party cadres to the villages. According to the situation of the branch and the existing problems, the party rectification materials are studied, and the branch party members are educated. At the same time, through checking work, criticism and self-criticism are carried out, achievements are affirmed, errors are criticized, and organizational rectification is carried out on the basis of ideological awakening. Party members who have made mistakes are given punishment according to the principles of the Party and according to different circumstances, after strict procedures. This further purified and consolidated the grassroots organizations of the Party. Because the rectification was carried out on the basis of ideological awakening, and the methods were thorough and steady, the branch party members not only did not fluctuate, but also consciously participated in the party rectification, and were satisfied after the rectification.

　　Before this rectification, various places conducted relatively sufficient preparation and mobilization work. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the provincial and local committees established rectification leading bodies – rectification committees, published "Rectification Bulletins," improved the "Branch Small Newspaper" published by local branches, and exchanged rectification experiences. In addition, a large number of party cadres were trained to be specifically responsible for the rectification work. Chahar Province alone trained more than 700 people. Before the intensive training, methods such as branch secretary joint meetings were adopted to explain the purpose of the rectification, the guiding principles of the intensive training, and the duration of the intensive training to the party members, and to assist the trained party members in arranging their production and housework. Therefore, most of the trained party members had a high learning mood.

### 华北各地基层组织的整训工作

　　华北各地基层组织的整训工作
    去年十一月中旬开始的华北各地中国共产党的基层组织的整训工作，已获很大的成绩。截至目前止，华北五省及内蒙古自治区经过训练的党员已达二十一万余人。晋、察、冀、平原四省已有六千九百多个农村支部经过整顿。仅山西一省经过集训的党员即达四万三千八百余人，并有二千五百余农村支部经过了整顿。
    此次华北各地中共基层组织整训的目的，在于提高党员的政治觉悟，克服命令主义，发扬民主作风，巩固和纯洁党的组织，加强支部的战斗力，以适应新形势的需要。整训分两步进行：第一步——党员集训工作，一般以县为单位，每个支部抽调五个至八个党员分批到县集训，每期约三、五百人，训练时间半月左右。训练内容包括抗美爱国时事教育、群众路线、生产政策和党的基本知识等四项。训练由专职干部负责，县委亲自掌握。训练的方法，一般都是根据党员思想情况，结合检查工作，讲解和讨论结合进行，进行中，通过启发报告、小组酝酿、典型发言、大会讨论、解答和总结等方式，运用好坏典型对比，以真人真事的生动实例来提高党员的思想觉悟。
    已受过训练的党员的思想和政治水平都有显著提高，特别是抗美爱国的时事教育，对提高党员的积极性和战斗意志，起了很大的作用。很多党员经过学习后，更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的真面目和抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大意义，加强了国际主义和爱国主义的理解。他们一致表示：要回去好好地领导农民群众搞好生产工作，支援中国人民解放军和加强国防力量。在工作作风问题上，经过群众路线、群众观点的教育，也有很大的收获。山西榆社县集训班以尺寨村劳动模范张志全的领导方法为例，说明群众路线领导方法的好处，又以另一实例说明强迫命令作风的害处。这样采取好坏典型的对比，经过启发和讨论，批判了某些党员认为“不强迫命令完不成任务”和“群众落后不强迫不行”等错误思想，使受训的党员认识和体会了群众路线的领导方法。已受过训的党员干部，在秋征，冬季生产等工作中，工作作风都有显著转变。在生产方向和生产政策的教育上，进一步肃清了某些党员“怕冒尖”以及不愿参加和领导互助组织等错误思想。党的基本知识教育，使党员对党纲党章有了基本的认识。
    各地整训工作的第二步——支部整顿工作，一般多以受过训的党员为骨干，由县区党员干部随同到村领导进行。根据支部情况和存在的问题，学习整党教材，对支部党员进行教育。同时，通过检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，肯定成绩，批判错误，在思想觉悟的基础上进行组织整顿。对于犯错误的党员，依照党的原则，依据不同的情况，经过严格的手续，分别给予处分。这样使党的基层组织进一步地达到了纯洁和巩固。由于在思想觉悟基础上进行整顿，而且办法周密稳当，支部党员不但没有波动，而且自觉地参加整党，整顿后都感到满意。
    这次整训前各地都进行了较充分的准备与动员工作。中共中央华北局及各省委会、地方委员会都成立了整训领导机构——整训委员会，出版“整训通报”，健全了各地支部出版的“支部小报”，交流整训经验。此外，并训练了大批党员干部，专门负责整训工作。仅察哈尔一省即训练了七百余人。集训前，采取支书联席会等方式，向党员说明整训目的、集训方针、和集训期限，并协助受训党员安置他们的生产和家务，因而多数受训党员的学习情绪都很高。
