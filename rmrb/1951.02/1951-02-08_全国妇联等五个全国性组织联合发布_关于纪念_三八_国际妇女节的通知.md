　　The All-China Women's Federation and Four Other National Organizations Jointly Issue a Notice Regarding the Commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day

　　[This Newspaper] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation have jointly issued a notice regarding the commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day and slogans for the commemoration. The full text of the notice is as follows:

　　Currently, the Chinese people are engaged in a struggle of great historical significance: resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have already inflicted serious blows on U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. A fervent movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has swept across the country, with women actively participating in this movement and supporting the victory at the front. However, the U.S. imperialists not only refuse to cease their aggressive actions in Korea but also slander our country as an "aggressor" and attempt to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan to expand the war of aggression. The Chinese people are fully determined and confident that they can inflict even heavier blows on the imperialists who dare to invade us and achieve even greater victories. Therefore, the central task for people's organizations at all levels in commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day this year should be to continue patriotic and internationalist education among the broad masses of women, expand and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists' plot to rearm Japan, and mobilize women to participate more actively in the various construction undertakings of the motherland (first and foremost, production and construction). At the same time, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea should be combined with the immediate interests and routine work of the masses of women, expand women's unity, maintain the rights women have already gained, and strive for women to achieve greater accomplishments on the road to liberation.

　　The methods of commemoration can be determined based on the specific conditions in each locality and the level of awareness among the masses of women, holding various large and small-scale demonstrations and commemorative meetings, symposiums, etc. Women in areas that have not yet held demonstrations against U.S. aggression and in support of Korea can hold patriotic demonstrations against U.S. aggression and against the rearmament of Japan on "March 8th." Small cities and rural areas can also hold such demonstrations. In areas that have already held such demonstrations or are unable to hold demonstrations for other reasons, lectures should be held as much as possible, or existing mass gatherings such as market fairs and temple fairs should be used to promote the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and to promote "March 8th" International Women's Day. The main content of the above commemorative meetings, symposiums, demonstrations, market fair and temple fair propaganda, etc., should be resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, mobilizing women to participate in formulating patriotic covenants, and opposing the U.S. imperialists' plot to rearm Japan. Where appropriate conditions exist, cooperation with relevant authorities can be undertaken to reward female labor models in various enterprises and other work posts. In order to more broadly mobilize women from all sectors to participate in the commemoration of "March 8th," diverse commemorative methods should be adopted, such as hosting preferential movie screenings, photo exhibitions, tours, garden parties, etc. In the commemorative work of "March 8th," special respect and preferential treatment should be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and the families of young people participating in military cadre schools.

　　When carrying out the "March 8th" commemoration work, people's organizations in various localities should consult together and jointly prepare. From now on, the regular contact between people's organizations should be further strengthened, and women's federations in various localities should take the initiative to invite other people's organizations and other democratic women's organizations to discuss certain divisions of labor and cooperation and regular contact methods for the regular contact and education of women, so as to strengthen the mass foundation of each organization and expand the organization of the masses of women.

　　The commemorative activities of "March 8th" should widely absorb women from all classes, all nationalities, all democratic parties, and all religious beliefs, and special attention should be paid to absorbing family members of employees, housewives, etc., who do not usually participate in social activities, so that "March 8th" truly becomes a festival for the broad masses of women.

    目前，中国人民正在进行着具有重大历史意义的抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争。中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，在朝鲜战场上已给予美帝国主义以严重的打击；全国人民掀起了热火朝天的抗美援朝运动，广大妇女也积极地参加了这一运动，支援了前线的胜利。但是美帝国主义者，不但不肯停止其在朝鲜的侵略行动，反侮蔑我国为“侵略者”，并妄想单独对日本媾和，重新武装日本，以扩大侵略战争。中国人民完全有决心和信心能够给予敢于侵略我们的帝国主义者以更沉重的打击，取得更大的胜利。因此，各级人民团体今年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的中心任务，应在广大妇女群众中继续进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育，扩大深入抗美援朝运动，坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋，动员妇女更积极地参加祖国的各种建设事业（首先是生产建设）。同时应使抗美援朝运动与妇女群众的切身利益及经常工作相结合，扩大妇女的团结，保持妇女已得的权利，争取妇女在解放道路上获得更大的成就。
    纪念的办法，可斟酌各地具体情况与妇女群众的觉悟程度，举行各种大、小规模的示威游行及纪念会、座谈会等。各地妇女凡未举行过抗美援朝游行示威者，可于“三八”节举行抗美援朝反对重新武装日本的爱国游行示威，小城市及农村，亦可举行这种示威游行。已举行过这种示威游行的地方或由于其他原因不能举行示威游行的地方，则尽可能举行讲演会或利用群众原有的集会如集场庙会等，进行抗美援朝及“三八”国际妇女节的宣传。以上纪念会、座谈会、示威游行、集场庙会宣传等，均应以抗美援朝、发动妇女参加订立爱国公约、反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋为主要内容。在具备适当条件的地方，可与有关机关合作，奖励各种企业及其他工作岗位上的女劳动模范，为着能更广泛发动各方面的妇女参加“三八”节的纪念，宜采取多种多样的纪念方式，如举办看电影优待、图片展览、参观、游园会等。在“三八”节的纪念工作中，对革命烈士家属、人民志愿军和人民解放军的家属以及参加军事干部学校的青年的家属，应特别予以尊敬和优待。
    在进行“三八”节的纪念工作时，各地人民团体应共同协商，联合筹备。从此要更加强各人民团体经常的联系，各地妇女联合会更应主动地邀约各人民团体与其他民主妇女团体，对经常联系与教育妇女的工作，商得一定的分工配合与经常联络的办法，以加强各团体的群众基础，扩大妇女群众的组织。
    “三八”节的纪念活动，应当广泛地吸收各阶层、各民族、各民主党派、各种宗教信仰的妇女，并应特别注意吸收平时不大参加社会活动的职工家属、家庭妇女等等，使“三八”节真正成为广大妇女的节日。
