　　Jinzhou Railway Administration Materials Department Dismisses Workers Without Implementing the Trade Union Law Editor:
    The Northeast People's Government Construction Committee, in October of last year, in order to build a major project, needed a large amount of ballast. Therefore, it signed a contract with the Materials Department of the Jinzhou Railway Administration, from November of last year to the end of March of this year, to mine 260,000 cubic meters of ballast. At that time, the various quarrying sites under the Materials Department had only 1,200 workers. In order to complete the order on time, another 1,300 workers were recruited. By mid-January, 150,000 cubic meters of ballast had been mined. However, the Construction Committee failed to implement the original provision of shipping out the ballast at any time. It was not until the Materials Department urged the shipment that the Construction Committee replied by telephone, saying: "We don't need the ballast anymore." At the end of January, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government notified the Materials Department in writing to cancel the order contract, and notified the Materials Department to submit a roster of the stonemasons hired after the order to the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government for processing.
    Due to the above situation, the Materials Department decided to dismiss all the remaining 2,200 quarry workers, except for 300 workers to do the loading work (because the current stockpile of 150,000 cubic meters of ballast will not be used up by the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in one year). However, in handling the dismissal of workers, the department violated government decrees.
    Article 22 of the Trade Union Law stipulates: "When the administrative side or the capitalist dismisses workers or staff, it shall notify the trade union's grassroots committee of the list of the personnel to be dismissed and the reasons for it ten days in advance." However, the Materials Department neither notified the grassroots trade union committees of each quarry of the list of personnel to be dismissed and the reasons in advance; nor did it promptly pay the workers dismissal compensation after announcing the dismissal of workers.
    It should be pointed out that the Materials Department has always not valued the trade unions in the various quarries. Since the organization of trade unions began in the various mountain areas in June of last year, the Materials Department has never implemented the provisions of Article 24 of the Trade Union Law, allocating trade union funds on a monthly basis. Furthermore, it withheld 3% of the total wage amount allocated by the Construction Committee in October of last year for worker's labor insurance. It even attempted to use this labor insurance fund as dismissal compensation. The Jinzhou District Trade Union Directly Subordinate Committee raised objections after learning about this, but the issue had not been resolved as of the 16th of this month.
    Currently, the workers who have been dismissed from the various quarrying sites have not received the dismissal compensation they are entitled to for more than ten days after being dismissed, nor have they been introduced to new jobs. In addition, they have not received labor insurance benefits in the past. A small number of workers have already begun selling their luggage and clothing to maintain their lives. The problem urgently needs to be resolved.

    Editor's Note: If the Jinzhou Railway Administration Materials Department is handling the dismissal of workers and the matter is true, then it is clearly in violation of the Trade Union Law. The Railway Trade Union Jinzhou District Directly Subordinate Committee and the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government Labor Department should represent and safeguard the interests of the working class, demanding and supervising the Materials Department to quickly handle the aftermath of the unemployed workers, appropriately issuing dismissal compensation to the workers; for long-term workers, the Labor Department and the Railway Trade Union Jinzhou District Directly Subordinate Committee should also be responsible for organizing their reemployment.
    According to the reader's letter, the error of the Northeast People's Government Construction Committee lies in not promptly notifying the Materials Department to reduce production based on changes in the project plan, thus causing an excessive accumulation of ballast and the phenomenon of production stoppage. This fact should also be reviewed if it is true.

  Suggest the Government Ban Absurd Propaganda Editor:
    Around the Spring Festival, a "Promotion Chart" has been circulating in the market. It has no publishing address or author's name. The chart is printed with the heads of the Central People's Government and government organizations at all levels as its content. We believe that the "Promotion Chart" is a reflection of the backward ideas of getting promoted and becoming wealthy in the old society, which should not be promoted in the new China; more seriously, this behavior of disrespecting people's leaders and the people's regime is extremely wrong. I hope that the relevant authorities should immediately ban this absurd publication.

    Editor:
    A few days ago, I bought a pack of "Red Knight" cigarettes on the streets of Beijing, which contained a "History of Victory in the Eight-Year War of Resistance," which depicted the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and his accomplices, titled "Chiang as Chairman." Obviously, this is a reactionary propaganda poster. "Red Knight" cigarettes are produced by the Shanghai Yuhua Tobacco Co., Ltd. I suggest that the relevant authorities should immediately prohibit the sale of "Red Knight" cigarettes and investigate the root cause of this reactionary propaganda.

  Trees Along Xixian Highway Damaged Editor:
    On the 16th of this month, on the highway from Wulongji to Xixian in Henan, I saw willow trees along the road being devastated into bare trees without branches or leaves. This year, the government has especially called on everyone to plant more trees along the roads to protect dikes and regulate the climate. However, some of the trees along the highway are being damaged and no one is taking care of them. This bias of only focusing on planting trees without focusing on protection is not right. I hope that local township governments can strengthen the protection of trees.

  Cui Youyi, Communication Work Model of Datong Telecommunications Section, Tianjin Railway Administration
    Cui Youyi, the communication foreman of the Datong Telecommunications Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration, has not had any liability accidents in the year since he served as the station attendant in Baoziwan in January 1950. His earthing and straightening work of telegraph poles is the best among all sections and stations in the Tianjin Bureau. Cui Youyi has now been rated as a meritorious worker at the Tianjin Bureau's telecommunications conference, and as the number one model party member among the eight party branches in the Datong area railway system.
    In 1949, Cui Youyi began to be responsible for the maintenance of pole lines and communication machinery among the three stations of Sandaoying, Xiaqiying, and Taobuqi. There are 321 telegraph poles and 127 kilometers of wires under his jurisdiction. Forty-five percent of this line is mountainous, the lines are complex, and the poles are of varying quality. After understanding these situations, he formulated a plan according to the technical equipment and maintenance materials at the time, and according to the different climates and work focuses, and implemented it step by step. He eliminated large joints, replaced damaged insulators, added nuts, straightened leaning poles, and cleared weeds and earthed the base of telegraph poles, maintaining them without obstacles for eleven months.
    Cui Youyi's achievements are due to the fact that he has learned, under the constant education of the Party, that relying on the masses is the solution. In his work, he also often pays attention to not damaging crops. The farmers near the railway line all said: "Old Cui is really good to us. He helps us, and we help him." Cui Youyi patrols with the militia, obtaining the help of the militia and local people. No theft has occurred on the lines he manages. He also maintains close contact with the engineering section; when he checks the lines, he also keeps an eye on the engineering equipment, and the engineering road maintenance crew also helps him. Once, during heavy rain, a flash flood washed away the ground crossbeam of the telegraph pole next to Bridge No. 413. The engineering section workers discovered it during a road inspection and carefully checked it for him at the time. At the station, he actively engages in joint labor, whether it is passenger guidance, loading and unloading, or other work, as long as he has free time, he helps. In addition, he automatically takes on apprentices at Baoziwan Station, teaching station attendant Shen Weiyi to repair dispatcher magneto telephones and learn to test lines. Now Shen Weiyi's skills are sufficient to be a communication assistant. In the project to improve the Beijing-Baotou communication line, Cui Youyi not only provided information on the line conditions, but also discovered that unreasonable material unit prices were causing waste. The unit price of the original telegraph poles was cheaper than that of leg piles, so some units did not take leg piles and used ten-meter telegraph poles to saw them, a phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes, which was corrected after he pointed it out.
    Under the leadership of Cui Youyi, the work of the Datong Telecommunications Section has undergone new development. Taking the earthing work as a challenge to all work areas in the section, it drove the Yanggao work area to complete the earthing work of 333 telegraph poles between Luowenzao and Wangguanrentun ahead of schedule. The telecommunications work was not affected when a strong wind blew on May 4th of last year. At the staff and worker representative meeting of the entire Beijing-Suiyuan line on June 15th of last year, the Zhangjiakou Branch called on the telecommunications departments to launch the Cui Youyi movement, so that the original phenomenon of "finding people for faults" in each work area was transformed into "people finding faults." After the signal department launched the Cui Youyi movement, no accidents occurred with the signal equipment at the 29 stations under the section's jurisdiction in July. In mid-August, in the Kouquan branch line project, the engineering team learned Cui Youyi's working methods of contacting the masses, cherishing seedlings, and were welcomed by the farmers, who voluntarily delivered water to the engineering team. Now, when the workers of the Datong Telecommunications Section mention Cui Youyi, they all say: "Working with Old Cui is the way to go, no difficulty is a problem." Lai Weiliang

　  锦州铁路管理局材料处解雇工人没有执行工会法编辑同志：
    东北人民政府修建委员会，去年十月间为建筑某重要工程，需要大量石碴。因此与锦州铁路管理局材料处，订立了自去年十一月至本年三月底，开采二十六万立方米石碴的订货合同。当时该材料处所属各采石山场仅有一千二百名工人，为按时完成订货任务，又招收一千三百名工人。至一月中旬，已采出石碴十五万立方米。但修建委员会却未执行随时运出石碴的原规定。直至材料处催运时，修建委员会才用电话回答说：“石碴不要了。”一月末又由辽西省人民政府书面通知材料处取消此项订货合同，并通知材料处将订货后招雇的石工造一名册，送辽西省人民政府处理。
    由于以上情况，材料处决定除留下三百名工人做装车工作外，其余二千二百名采石工人全部解雇（因为目前积存的十五万立方米石碴，锦州路局一年也用不完）。但该处在处理解雇工人的问题上，却违反了政府法令。
    工会法第二十二条规定：“行政方面或资方，解雇工人或职员时，应将拟解雇人员之名单与理由，于十日前通知工会基层委员会。”但材料处事前既没有将拟解雇人员名单和理由通知各石场的工会基层委员会；在宣布解雇工人以后，也没有及时发给工人解雇金。
    应该指出：材料处对各采石场工会一向就不重视。自去年六月各山场开始组织工会以来，材料处从来没有执行工会法第二十四条的规定，按月拨交工会经费。并且扣押了去年十月修建委员会拨付的工资总额百分之三的工人劳保费。此次竟企图以该项劳保经费充作解雇金。锦州区工会直属委员会知道后曾提出反对意见，但问题一直至本月十六日还没有解决。
    现在各采石山场被解雇的工人，因为解雇后十余天既没有得到应得的解雇金，也没有被介绍职业，再加上过去没有实行劳保待遇，少数工人已经开始卖行李、衣服来维持生活，问题急待解决。
    中国铁路工会锦州区委会文教部  于龙年
    编者按：锦州铁路管理局材料处在处理解雇工人的问题上如果事情属实，那显然是违犯工会法的。铁路工会锦州区直属委员会及辽西省人民政府劳动厅应该代表和维护工人阶级的利益，要求并监督该材料处迅速处理失业工人的善后问题，适当地发给工人解雇金；对长年工人，劳动厅和铁路工会锦州区直属委员会并应负责组织其转业。
    根据读者来信反映，东北人民政府修建委员会的错误，在于没有根据工程计划的变动，及时地通知材料处缩减生产，因而造成了石碴存积过多，停止生产的现象。这一事实如果属实也应进行检讨。
  建议政府取缔荒谬宣传品编辑同志：
    春节前后，市面上流行着一种“升官图”，没有出版地址，也没有作者姓名。该图是以中央人民政府各首长和各级政府组织为内容印制的。我们认为：“升官图”是旧社会升官发财落后思想的反映，在新中国是不应该提倡的；更严重的是这种不尊敬人民领袖和人民政权的行为，是极端错误的。我希望有关机关应立即取缔这种荒谬的出版物。
          北京市立六中  郑燕昌编辑同志：
    前几天，我在北京街上购得“红士牌”香烟一包，其中有“抗战八年胜利画史”一张，上面画着人民的公敌蒋介石及其帮凶们的像，题名“蒋任主席”。很显然，这是反动的宣传画片。“红士牌”香烟是上海裕华烟草股份有限公司的出品。我建议有关机关应即禁止“红士牌”香烟的出售，并且要查究这种反动宣传的根源。

  息县公路树木遭破坏编辑同志：
    本月十六日，我在河南乌龙集到息县的公路上，见到沿途的柳树被摧残得成了一棵棵无枝无叶的秃树。今年政府特别号召大家在公路两旁多栽树，以保护堤防与调节气候。可是现在有些公路旁的树木被破坏了没有人管。这种只注重栽树，而不注重保护的偏向，是不对的。希望各地乡政府能加强对树木的保护。

  天津铁路管理局大同电务段通信工作模范崔有义
    天津铁路管理局大同电务段通信工长崔有义，自一九五○年一月担任堡子湾驻站员以来，一年中没有发生任何责任事故。他的电杆培土和整正工作，在天津局各段站作得最好。现崔有义已在天津局电务会议上被评为功臣，在大同地区铁路系统的八个党支部中，被评为第一名模范党员。
    一九四九年崔有义开始担任负责三道营，旗下营和陶卜齐三站间的杆线及通信机械的维修工作。管内有三百二十一根电杆，一百二十七公里的电线。这段线路百分之四十五是山地，线条复杂，线杆好坏不一。他了解这些情况后，按照当时的技术设备和维修材料，根据不同的气候和工作重点订出计划，按照计划逐步进行。他消灭了大接头，更换了破损的磁瓶，补充了螺丝母，扶正了歪杆，整理了拉线和电杆根部除草培土，保持了十一个月没障碍。
    崔有义所以获得这些成绩，是由于他在党的不断教育下，懂得依靠群众就有办法的道理。他在工作中并经常注意，不踏坏庄稼，铁路沿线附近的农民们都说：“老崔对我们真好，他帮助我们，我们也帮助他。”崔有义和民兵一起巡逻，取得民兵和当地群众的帮助，他所管的线路一直没有发生偷盗事件。他与工务段联系也密切；在他查线的时候，顺便留神工务设备，工务道班也帮他的忙。有一次下大雨，山洪把四一三号桥旁电杆的地中横木冲出，工务段工友查道发现后当时替他仔细作了检查。在车站他积极地搞联合劳动，不论是旅客向导、装卸等工作，只要他有空闲时间就帮助做。此外，他在堡子湾车站自动带徒弟，教会站员沈维义修理调度磁石电话机，学试线。现在沈维义的技术已可作一个通信帮工了。在改善京包通信线路工程中，崔有义不但提供了线路情况，而且发现因为材料单价不合理，造成浪费的偏向。原电杆单价比腿桩便宜，所以有些单位不领腿桩，用十公尺的电杆锯制，这种大材小用现象，经他指出后才纠正了。
    在崔有义的带动下，大同电务段的工作有了新的开展。以培土工作向全段各工区挑战，带动了阳高工区，提前完成罗文皂、王官人屯间电杆三三三根培土工作，去年五月四日刮大风时亦未影响通信工作。在去年六月十五日京绥全线职工代表会议上，张家口分局号召电务部门开展崔有义运动，使各工区原有“故障找人”的现象转变为“人找故障”。信号部门开展了崔有义运动之后，七月份该段管内二十九站信号设备未发生事故。八月中，工程队在口泉支线工程中，学习了崔有义的联系群众的工作方法，爱护青苗，受到农民的欢迎，纷纷自动送水给工程队。现在大同电务段的工友们一提起崔有义，都说：“跟老崔工作有办法，什么困难也不成问题。”    来维良
