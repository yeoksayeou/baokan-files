    Cannot Tolerate Thailand's Persecution of Our Overseas Chinese

    To the Editor:
    I am an overseas Chinese who returned from Thailand. Last summer, after returning to the motherland, I studied at the Xinxiang Middle School in Pingyuan Province. On February 3rd, I saw the news in the People's Daily about the Thai reactionary authorities illegally arresting the person in charge of Quanmin Bao (The People's News), and I was very indignant.
    Quanmin Bao is a progressive newspaper published by overseas Chinese in Thailand. It allows overseas Chinese youth in Thailand to understand the situation after the victory of the revolution in the motherland. After learning about the situation in the motherland from Quanmin Bao, I tried to return to the country.
    The patriotic overseas Chinese in Thailand have been persecuted by the Thai reactionary government. They unreasonably arrest and beat us; they do not allow us to study Chinese, forcing us to study Thai; they prohibit the import of our motherland's books and do not allow us to raise our national flag or sing our national anthem. When I stepped on the mainland of the motherland, I was welcomed and encouraged by my compatriots and received preferential treatment and care from the Central People's Government. I deeply felt the warmth of the motherland.
    Now, when I think of the overseas Chinese in Thailand still suffering from all kinds of illegal oppression, I am very angry. I want to tell the Thai reactionary authorities: The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never tolerate such illegal behavior.

### 不能容许泰国迫害我侨民

    不能容许泰国迫害我侨民编辑同志：
    我是从泰国回国的华侨。去年夏天，我回到祖国后，在平原省立新乡中学念书。在二月三日人民日报上，我看到泰国反动当局非法逮捕全民报负责人的消息，非常愤恨。
    全民报是在泰国的华侨所出版的进步报纸，它使在泰国的华侨青年们了解祖国革命胜利后的情况。我从全民报上知道了祖国的情况后，就设法回国来了。
    在泰国的爱国华侨们一直受着泰国反动政府迫害。他们无理逮捕、殴打我们；他们不让我们学习中国文，强迫我们学习泰文；他们禁止我们祖国的书籍入口，不让我们升挂国旗，唱国歌。我踏上祖国的大陆的时候，我受到祖国同胞们的欢迎和鼓励，并且受到中央人民政府的优待和照顾。我深深感到祖国的温暖。
    现在，我想起在泰国的华侨还受着种种非法的压迫，非常愤怒。我要告诉泰国反动当局：站起来了的中国人民对于这种非法行为，是决不能容忍的。
