Title: What Should New Year Picture Artists Pay Attention To?

To the Editor:

I am reflecting here on a noteworthy situation to our New Year picture makers. Generally speaking, in the old liberated areas, the masses mostly like New Year pictures; but if New Year pictures are made too hastily, they will also be opposed by the masses.

For example, before the Spring Festival this year, in De County, Shandong (an old area), farmers did not buy many New Year pictures. I asked several picture sellers, and they all said that New Year pictures did not sell as well as old New Year pictures. I was very surprised at first. Later, around the picture stalls, I heard some farmers talking about New Year pictures. Regarding a New Year picture titled "Freedom of Marriage," they said, "What does this mean? Is a picture with a few people on a piece of paper called a New Year picture?". Regarding "Bumper Cotton Harvest" and "Buy a Big Yellow Ox, No Worries About Production," they said, "What's the point of looking at this? Which family hasn't bought an ox or picked cotton?" I think these opinions are worth paying attention to.

I feel that some New Year pictures are not welcomed by farmers because the artists have not deeply experienced the lives and feelings of the farmers, but only started from a concept, or used the feelings of intellectuals to replace them. Like "Buy a Big Yellow Ox, No Worries About Production," this simple photographic depiction does not give the masses more. Its ideological and artistic qualities are inferior. Here, our New Year picture artists should better understand the thoughts, feelings, and preferences of farmers, and at the same time, elevate their thinking a step further, and educate farmers through the forms that farmers like. For example, when we promote labor mutual aid, we can portray the mutual aid group of labor hero Zhang Fugui. To promote Sino-Soviet friendship, it is better to paint a scene of farmers' labor heroes being welcomed in the Soviet Union than to paint a Chinese person shaking hands with a Soviet friend. Farmers like opera paintings (i.e., exciting scenes from old dramas), and we can also paint the exciting scenes from "The White Haired Girl" and "Liu Hulan." If we paint familiar historical stories such as "Fighting the Fishing Tyrants", "Yue Fei Fighting the Jin", and "Heroes of Liangshan" into New Year pictures, that would of course also be meaningful.

### 新年画作者应注意什么？

　　新年画作者应注意什么？
    编辑同志：
    我在这里对我们的新年画制作者反映一种值得注意的情况。一般的说，在老解放区，群众大多喜爱新年画；但如果新年画制造的太草率，也会遭到群众的反对。
    如今年春节前，在山东德县（是老区），农民买新年画的却不多。我曾问过几个卖画的，他们都说新年画没有旧年画卖得多。我初听很奇怪，后来在画摊周围，我听到一些农民谈论起新年画：对一幅题名《婚姻自由》的年画，他们说：“这是啥意思，一张纸画上几个人这就叫年画？”。对于《棉花丰收》和《买只大黄牛，生产不犯愁》，他们说：“这有啥看头，谁家没买过牛拾过棉花？”我觉得这些意见是值得重视的。
    我觉得有些新年画不为农民欢迎，是因为作者没深入地去体验农民的生活和心情，只是从一个概念出发，或者是用知识分子的心情去代替他们。像《买只大黄牛，生产不犯愁》这种简单的照像似的描写法，没有给群众更多的东西，它所表现的思想性和艺术性都是低劣的。在这里，我们的新年画作者，应该多体会农民的思想、感情和喜好，同时也要把他们的思想提高一步，通过农民所喜爱的形式来教育农民。例如：我们宣传劳动互助，就可以把劳动英雄张富贵的互助组表现出来。宣传中苏友好，与其画一个中国人和一个苏联朋友握手，就不如画农民劳动英雄到苏联受欢迎的场面，来得有力。农民喜欢戏画（即旧剧里面的精彩场面），我们也可以把《白毛女》、《刘胡兰》里的精彩场面画出来。如把《打渔杀家》、《岳飞抗金》、《梁山英雄》等农民熟悉的历史故事，画成年画，那当然也是有意义的。
