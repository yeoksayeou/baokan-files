Explanation by the People's Supervision Committee

Since the People's Daily published the results of this committee's handling of the Lin Jie et al. case of violating policies for private gain on December 21, 1950, some readers have written to the People's Daily, believing that the committee's punishment of Lin Jie was too lenient. This fully demonstrates the people's concern for the government's work and their sense of responsibility to the country and the people.

Lin Jie's mistake occurred in November 1949. After accepting the case in March 1950, the committee sent personnel to investigate and research, and exchanged opinions with the relevant departments many times. After repeated discussions and careful consideration, the case was closed in October 1950, and the handling results were announced on December 21. The case was delayed for a long time, and the committee's introduction to the case was not perfect when it announced the handling results, and some of the wording was not colloquial enough. These are shortcomings in our work. Regarding the severity of the punishment, we have repeatedly studied it after receiving letters from readers and believe that giving Lin Jie a demerit of two major offenses is appropriate. In order to gain a deeper understanding of everyone's opinions and further weigh the issue of Lin Jie's punishment, we also consulted with relevant departments and invited readers Lu Wangzhi, Yu Yi, Chu Yuanxi, and others from Beijing and Zhangjiakou who had written letters to come to the committee for a discussion. As a result of the discussion, everyone agreed with the committee's original opinion on Lin Jie's punishment. The following is a comprehensive description of the various circumstances that the committee considered regarding Lin Jie's mistakes and the opinions discussed at the symposium:

The committee adheres to the spirit of "curing the disease to save the patient" in punishing cadres who violate discipline, combining punishment and education. When investigating specific cases, the severity of the circumstances of each case, the motivation and purpose of the mistake, and especially the extent of the harm caused by the mistake to the country and the people are the main basis. Secondly, we consider the offender's review and understanding of the mistakes made afterward. Then, we give appropriate punishment with reference to cases of similar nature. This approach ensures that the country's laws and disciplines are upheld, so that all staff members are aware of the need for vigilance; at the same time, it gives those who make mistakes an opportunity to correct them.

Lin Jie and others intended to preserve the value of their salaries because prices had not stabilized at that time (August 1949). However, instead of depositing their salaries in the People's Bank with real-value savings, they jointly purchased and hoarded a barrel of paint, thus violating the government's regulations prohibiting government employees from engaging in business. However, the amount of paint hoarded was very small and had no significant impact on the market. Subsequently, Lin Jie violated price policies and purchased flour cheaply for the company's employee cooperative in exchange for lowering the listed price of special raw coal, causing the state to lose 500,000 yuan in coal prices, but he did not benefit personally from this. As for his connivance with Zheng Daqi's illegal buying and selling of cloth and coal, seeking private gain, and violating price policies by lowering listed prices, causing the state to lose another 500,000 yuan, his mistake was even more serious; however, investigation revealed that Lin Jie himself did not participate in the profits. Finally, Lin Jie's attempt to purchase coal for personal profit was stopped when discovered by company employees, his purpose was not achieved, and state assets were not lost. The above are the specific circumstances of Lin Jie's mistakes. In a political sense, Lin Jie committed the error of being unprincipled, undisciplined, violating policies, and seeking enjoyment; however, the degree of harm he caused to society was not great. Therefore, the committee's punishment of giving Lin Jie two major demerits is appropriate.

The most severe administrative punishment is dismissal. Lin Jie's punishment is only second to dismissal. Only when he has made greater achievements and contributions in his work, sufficient to offset the losses to the country and the people caused by his mistakes, can he be explicitly revoked after certain administrative procedures and approvals. Before his original punishment is cancelled, the employee will be dismissed if he commits another major demerit in any position. Therefore, a punishment of two major demerits is quite severe and is sufficient to prompt the person concerned to thoroughly correct his past mistakes and work hard in order to redeem himself. According to investigation, Lin Jie has been able to deeply recognize his mistakes and has made progress in his work since being punished.

Readers' letters suggested that if Lin Jie is a Communist Party member, he should be subjected to further Party discipline. This opinion is correct. The Communist Party is the most disciplined political party, and Communist Party members who make mistakes must be subject to Party discipline. Lin Jie is a Communist Party member, and we have asked the CCP branch of the Ministry of Trade to handle everyone's opinions.

Thanks to the letters from all readers, the committee was able to conduct more in-depth research and consideration on the issue of Lin Jie's punishment, which enabled us to improve our work. In the future, we hope that readers will continue to provide opinions on cases handled by the committee, so that we can do a good job in the people's supervision work with everyone's help.

### 人民监察委员会的说明

　　人民监察委员会的说明
    自一九五○年十二月二十一日人民日报公布本委处理林洁等违反政策营私图利案件结果以后，有些读者致函人民日报，认为本委对林洁的处分过轻。这充分表现了人民对政府工作的关心以及对国家和人民的负责精神。
    林洁的错误发生在一九四九年十一月。本委在一九五○年三月受理该案后，即派员调查研究，并与主管部门多次交换意见；经过反复讨论，慎重考虑，至一九五○年十月结案，十二月二十一日公布处理结果。此案拖延很久，本委在公布处理结果时，对案情介绍不够完善，其中某些词句亦欠通俗，这是我们工作中的缺点。关于处分的轻重问题，在接获读者来信后，我们曾经再三研究，认为给林洁记两大过的处分是恰当的。为了更深入地了解大家的意见，进一步衡量对林洁的处分问题，又会同有关部门，约请北京及张家口的来信读者陆望之、于一、储元熹等来本委举行座谈会。讨论结果，大家都同意本委对林洁原定处分的意见。兹将本委衡量林洁所犯错误的各种情况和座谈会讨论的意见综合叙述如后：
    本委对于干部违犯纪律的处分，本“治病救人”的精神，惩戒与教育结合并用。查处具体案件时，以各该案件的情节轻重，犯错误的动机和目的，特别是所犯错误对国家和人民的危害程度大小为主要根据；其次，视犯案者事后对所犯错误的检讨和认识；然后参照同类性质的案件给以适当处分。这样处理，一方面使国家的法纪得以伸张，使全体工作人员知所警惕；同时又给犯错误的人以改过的机会。
    林洁等因当时（一九四九年八月）物价未趋稳定，意图将其所得薪金保值。但他们不将所得薪金折实存储人民银行，竟合伙购囤颜料一桶，以致违犯了政府工作人员不准经商的规定。不过所囤购的颜料为数甚少，对于市场尚无重大影响。继而林洁又违犯物价政策，以降低特原煤牌价为交换条件，代该公司职工合作社廉价购进面粉，使国家在煤价上损失人民币五十万元，但其本人尚无肥己情事。至于其纵容郑大器违法买卖布匹，煤斤，营私图利，并违犯价格政策，降低牌价，使国家又损失人民币五十万元，其错误更为严重；但查究结果，林洁本人并未参与其中渔利。末次，林洁企图自行购煤图利事，因被公司职员发觉中止，其目的并未实现，国家资财亦无损失。以上是林洁所犯错误的具体情况。在政治意义上，林洁是犯了无原则、无纪律，违犯政策，贪图享受的错误；但其对社会的危害程度不大，因此本委给予林洁记大过二次的处分是适当的。
    最严重的行政处分是撤职。而林洁所受处分仅次于撤职处分。只有其在工作上有较大成绩和贡献，足以抵销其所犯错误给予国家人民的损失时，经过一定的行政组织手续和批准，才能明令撤销。在其原有处分未注销前，该员无论在任何工作岗位上，如因犯错误再记一大过，即行撤职。因此，记大过两次的处分是相当严重的，足以促使当事人痛改前非，努力工作，以便立功赎过。据查，林洁自受处分以来，尚能深切认识错误，工作上亦有进步。
    读者来信提出：林洁如果是共产党员，应该再受党的处分。这个意见是对的。共产党是最有纪律的政党，共产党员犯了错误，一定要受到党的纪律的制裁。林洁是一个共产党员，我们已将大家的意见，请贸易部中共党支部办理。
    由于诸位读者来信，本委对于林洁处分问题能更深刻研究考虑，使我们工作能更提高一步。今后本委处理的案件，仍希读者继续提供意见，以使我们在大家的帮助下，作好人民监察工作。
