Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: Yenching University, which had been receiving American subsidies for 32 years, was taken over by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education on the 12th. The entire faculty and student body of the university held a fervent rally to celebrate.

At the university-wide celebration, President Lu Zhiwei first announced: "From now on, whether in name, in reality, in the source of funding, or in the viewpoints and methods of teaching, Yenching University is completely and permanently a university of the Chinese people." In his speech, Lu Zhiwei also read out the second telegram he received on the 10th from the "United Board for Christian Colleges in China" in New York. This telegram shows that even today, American imperialism is still attempting to achieve its goal of continuing cultural aggression against the Chinese people through deceptive and enticing means. He stated that he would ignore this telegram and handed it over to Minister Ma on the spot. The entire audience immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause.

Next, Minister of Education Ma Xulun spoke, pointing out that the paper tiger of American imperialism has been exposed in the war of aggression against Korea, but the remnants of its cultural aggression in China must be thoroughly eradicated. He hoped that the faculty, students, and staff of Yenching University would work hard to complete this glorious task. Finally, he announced that the Government Administration Council had appointed Lu Zhiwei as the President of Yenching University. He also announced that the Ministry of Education had dispatched Liu Aifeng, Zhou Zhongqi, Gao Erbo, Li Yizhou, and Shen Yifan to form a takeover team, with Liu Aifeng as the team leader, to assist President Lu in handling the takeover matters.

Subsequently, Vice Ministers of Education Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun delivered speeches. Vice Minister Qian first pointed out that Yenching University's return to the embrace of the great People's Motherland is a great joy. He said: Given that Yenching University was long controlled by American imperialist element John Leighton Stuart, all faculty, students, and staff must not only sever economic ties with American imperialism in the future but also ideologically eliminate all the ideological toxins of American imperialism. He hoped that all faculty, students, and staff, regardless of religious belief, would unite under the great banner of patriotism to run a good People's Yenching University. In his speech, Vice Minister Zeng encouraged everyone to strengthen unity within and outside the university, work together, and gradually transform Yenching University into a new type of university.

Guests attending the meeting, Qian Duansheng, representative of the National Committee of the China Education Trade Union, Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University Affairs Committee, Lin Liuru, President of Normal University, and Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, all spoke successively, unanimously congratulating the rebirth of Yenching University. Jiang Yinen, representative of the Yenching University Trade Union, and Xia Ziqiang, representative of the Student Union, unanimously expressed their support for the People's Government's takeover and expressed their determination to strengthen their work and study and strive to eradicate the remnants of American imperialist cultural aggression.

To celebrate the rebirth of Yenching University, the school held various sports performances, recreational activities, and torchlight parades in the afternoon and evening of the same day. (Attached photo)

    该校师生集会庆祝决心肃清美帝文化侵略遗毒
    【新华社十二日讯】接受美国津贴三十二年的燕京大学，已于十二日由中央人民政府教育部接收。该校全体师生热烈地集会庆祝。
    在全校庆祝大会上，校长陆志韦首先宣布：“从今以后，不论在名义上、实际上、经费来源上、教学的观点方法上，燕京大学都完全是并且永久是中国人民的大学了。”陆志韦在讲话中并宣读了他在十日接到纽约“美国在华基督教大学联合托事部”的第二封电报。这封电报说明美帝国主义到今天还以欺骗和利诱的手段，妄想达到它继续对中国人民进行文化侵略的目的。他表示对这个电报置之不理，并当场把电报交给了马部长。全场立即响起了热烈的掌声。
    接着由教育部部长马叙伦讲话，他指出：美帝国主义这只纸老虎在侵略朝鲜的战争中已经被戳穿了，但，它在中国文化侵略的遗毒，还须要彻底地加以肃清。他希望燕京大学师生员工努力完成这个光荣的任务。最后，他宣布政务院任命陆志韦为燕京大学校长。并宣布教育部派刘皑风、周钟岐、高尔柏、力易周、沈一帆等五人组织接收小组，以刘皑风为小组长，协同陆校长办理接收事宜。
    继由教育部副部长钱俊瑞、曾昭抡讲话。钱副部长首先指出，燕京大学回到了伟大的人民祖国的怀抱，是一件莫大的喜事。他说：鉴于燕京大学曾长期受美帝国主义分子司徒雷登把持，全体师生员工今后不但要在经济上和美帝国主义断绝联系，而且要从思想上肃清美帝国主义的一切思想毒素。他希望全体师生员工不分宗教信仰，在伟大的爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，办好人民的燕京大学。曾副部长在讲话时勉励大家加强校内和校外的团结，同心协力，使燕京大学逐步改造为一个新型的大学。
    到会来宾，中国教育工会全国委员会代表钱端升、北京大学校务委员会主席汤用彤、师范大学校长林砺儒、辅仁大学校长陈垣都先后讲话，一致祝贺燕京大学的新生。燕大工会代表蒋荫恩、学生会代表夏自强在讲话时一致表示拥护人民政府的接收，并表示决心加强工作和学习，为肃清美帝国主义文化侵略的遗毒而奋斗。
