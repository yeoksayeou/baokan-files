Xinhua News Agency Report: The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau issued "Instructions on Implementing the CCP Central Committee's Decision on Establishing Propaganda Networks" on January 27th. The instructions require all levels of Party committees to conscientiously study the CCP Central Committee's decision, examine the problems existing in local propaganda work, and formulate specific plans for establishing propaganda networks.

Regarding the development of propagandists, the instructions pointed out: Each county and city should summarize the experience of past pilot projects and prepare for further universal development. The existing propagandists in various places should be reviewed and reorganized according to the conditions stipulated by the CCP Central Committee; regions that have not yet established propagandists should immediately focus on establishing them to create experience before popularizing them comprehensively. The development of propagandists should be combined with various practical tasks, paying attention to absorbing Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists among the masses to participate. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the political quality of propagandists and not to lower their political level by simply pursuing numbers. After the propagandists are established, a regular working system must also be established.

The instructions require local Party committees to immediately establish reporters. The instructions also stipulate that secretaries of Party committees at all levels should serve as reporters, leading by example and driving the entire party to engage in propaganda work.

The instructions emphasized that the key to whether propagandists can play a role lies in the help and guidance of the leading organs. Secretaries of Party committees at all levels must regard leading the work of propagandists as an important political task. Party member cadres in charge of administrative work in factories, mines, government organs, and schools should assist the CCP branches in those institutions in leading the work of propagandists. Propagandists should be given regular work instructions and propaganda materials, and propaganda work meetings should be convened to deploy, inspect, and summarize work. The CCP committees of each province and city should publish regular propaganda handbooks; newspapers should also publish popular propaganda materials. Party committees at all levels should provide oral explanations to propagandists with lower cultural levels and use training classes, propagandist meetings, and teaching stations to help them correctly understand propaganda content and methods.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The CCP Central Committee Central South Bureau issued instructions on implementing the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of People Throughout the Party," requiring the Party organizations throughout the Central South region to strive for its thorough implementation.

The instructions clearly stated the need to establish three types of propaganda organizations and the steps for establishing these organizations:

(1) The reporter system will be established in two steps. First, appropriate personnel should be selected from the secretaries and members of the Party committees of provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, and districts, as well as Party members working in responsible positions in the people's governments at the above levels. These personnel should be approved by the Party committees to form a fixed organization, which, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, will give at least one political report to gatherings and representative meetings of the people (primarily workers and peasants) every two months, in accordance with the central government's decision. The list of reporters at the provincial (municipal) and prefectural levels should be sent to the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau for record by February.

After the above-mentioned reporters have been implemented for a period of time and gained experience, a certain number of Party members suitable for this work can be selected and approved by the Party committees to form a fixed organization. Under the leadership of the Party committees, they will regularly give political reports to the masses of people on behalf of the Party or hold forums for activists among the masses. They will also be required to hold regular meetings to review work, reflect the opinions of the masses, and improve reporting work.

(2) The Party's propagandist system must be gradually established in a planned and leadership-oriented manner in the branches of factories, mines, railways, government organs, schools, and urban street organizations, as well as in the rural branches where land reform has been completed, in accordance with the central government's regulations on the conditions for propagandists. Before June of this year, propagandists must be universally established in the above-mentioned organizations, forming fixed organizations and systems. In areas and organizations where branches have not yet been established, outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and activists among the masses can be recommended by the Communist Youth League Committee or the trade unions and peasant associations. With the approval of the district committee, they will become Party propagandists and conduct propaganda work under the direct leadership of the district committee.

(3) Most areas of the Central South region are newly liberated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to organize non-Party propaganda networks in appropriate forms. Especially during a certain period, in order to complete certain major political tasks, the Party committees at all levels should cooperate with the people's governments, the People's Liberation Army, the democratic parties, the people's organizations, and all sectors to form a huge mass propaganda force under the leadership of a unified propaganda committee to carry out propaganda work so as to penetrate deeply into many unorganized masses. During the work process and after the work is completed, it is essential to firmly grasp the work of developing propagandists. Especially after the work is completed, work inspections should be carried out immediately, and through work summaries and evaluation of achievements, activists in the movement should be discovered and selected. After organizational review and approval by the Party committee, they will become Party propagandists. Currently, in places where the patriotic anti-American aid-Korea movement has already begun, Party propagandists can be discovered and selected according to the above methods, and they can be formed into fixed organizations and systems. Under the leadership of the Party organization, they will conduct regular propaganda work in conjunction with the central work of the local area and the basic tasks of factories, government organs, and schools.

The instructions emphasized that the above three types of propaganda organizations are three inseparable components of the Party's propaganda network. Among them, reporters are its ideological guides, Party propagandists are the core uniting the vast non-Party propaganda forces, and non-Party propaganda forces are the assistants and reserve forces of the Party propagandists. Therefore, all three must cooperate closely and proceed simultaneously, and none should be neglected.

Finally, regarding the leadership of the propaganda network, the instructions require Party committees at all levels to clearly define propaganda tasks and content, and to provide propagandists with regular political leadership. The instructions also require Party committees of all provinces and cities to formulate specific plans for implementing this decision within six months before February 15th and report to the Central Bureau.

　　中共中央华北局暨中南局
　  指示各级党委认真建立宣传网
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中共中央华北局于一月二十七日发出“关于执行中共中央建立宣传网的决定的指示”。指示要求各级党委必须认真地学习中共中央的决定，检查本地宣传工作中所存在的问题，并制定建立宣传网的具体计划。
    关于发展宣传员问题，指示指出：各县、市应总结过去重点试建的经验，准备进一步普遍发展。各地现有的宣传员，应按中共中央所规定的条件予以审查和整理；还没有设立宣传员的地区，应即重点设立，以创造经验，再普及全面。发展宣传员应结合各种实际工作来进行，注意吸收共产党员、青年团员和群众中的积极分子参加。同时，必须注意宣传员的政治质量，不要单纯追求数字而降低了宣传员的政治水平。宣传员设立以后并须建立经常的工作制度。
    指示要求各地党委应即建立报告员。指示并规定各级党委书记应担任报告员，以身作则，带动全党作宣传工作。
    指示着重指出：宣传员能否发挥作用的重要关键在于领导机关的帮助与指导。各级党委书记必须把领导宣传员的工作当作重要政治任务。各地工矿、机关、学校中的行政上负责的党员干部，应协助各该机构中的中共支部领导宣传员工作。对宣传员应经常给以工作指示、宣传资料，召集宣传工作会议，布置、检查和总结工作。各省、市中共党的委员会应出版定期的宣传手册；报纸也应刊载通俗的宣传材料。各级党委对文化水平较低的宣传员，应向他们进行口头讲解，并利用训练班、宣传员会议、传授站等方式，帮助他们正确地了解宣传内容和方法。
    【本报讯】中共中央中南局发出关于执行中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”的指示，要求中南全区党的组织必须为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    指示明确地提出要建立三种宣传组织和建立这些组织的步骤：
    （一）报告员制度分两个步骤建立。首先在省、市、地方、县、区的党委员会的书记与委员以及上述各级人民政府内担任负责工作的党员中挑选适当人员，经党的委员会批准，形成固定组织，有计划地在党委统一领导之下按中央决定每两个月向人民群众（首先是工人、农民）的集会和代表会议至少作一次政治报告。省（市）、地级报告员名单，于二月份内送中南局宣传部备查。
    在上述报告员实行一个时期取得经验以后，可以挑选一定数量的适合于担任此项工作的党员经党的委员会批准。形成固定组织，在党的委员会领导之下，有计划地定期代表党向人民群众作政治报告，或举行群众积极分子座谈会，并规定他们定期举行会议，检查工作，反映群众意见，改进报告工作。
    （二）党的宣传员制度必须在工厂、矿山、铁路、机关、学校及城市街道的支部中和土地改革完成的农村支部中，有领导地有计划地按中央关于宣传员条件的规定逐步建立起来。在本年六月份前，上述组织中必须将宣传员普遍建立，并形成固定组织和制度。凡尚未建立支部的地区和组织，由青年团团委或工会、农会介绍优秀团员和群众中积极分子，经区委批准，成为党的宣传员，在区委直接领导下进行宣传工作。
    （三）中南大部地区是新区，因此组织适当形式的非党宣传网甚为必要。特别在一定时期，为着完成一定的重大政治任务，各级党的委员会应该协同人民政府、人民解放军、各民主党派、各人民团体和各界组成规模巨大的群众性的宣传队伍，在统一的宣传委员会领导之下，开展宣传工作，以便深入到许多尚未组织起来的群众中去。在工作过程当中及工作结束之后，必须抓紧发展宣传员的工作。特别在工作结束后应立即进行工作检查，并通过工作总结和评判成绩，发现与选拔运动中的积极分子，经过党委的组织审查批准，成为党的宣传员，目前业已展开了抗美援朝的爱国主义运动的地方，即可按上述方法发现与挑选党的宣传员，并使其形成固定组织和制度，在党的组织领导下，结合当地中心工作和工厂、机关、学校基本任务，进行经常性的宣传工作。
    指示并着重指出：以上三种宣传组织，是党的宣传网的不可分割的三个组成部分。其中报告员是它的思想上的指导者，党的宣传员则是团结广大非党宣传队伍的核心，而非党宣传队伍则是党的宣传员的助手和后备军。因此，三者都必须密切配合，同时进行，不可偏废。
    最后，对于宣传网的领导，该指示要求各级党委明确规定宣传任务与内容。予宣传员以经常性的政治领导。并要求各省市党委于二月十五日以前订出在半年内实施本决定的具体计划，报告中央局。
