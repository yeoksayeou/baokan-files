　　Fight to the End for World Peace
　　——Endorse the Great Resolutions of the World Peace Council
    The First Session of the World Peace Council successfully concluded in Berlin on the 26th of this month. After discussing the implementation of the Second World Congress program, and the peaceful resolution of the German and Japanese issues, the meeting unanimously adopted ten documents, including "Resolution on the United Nations," "Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact," "Resolution on the Peaceful Resolution of the German Question," "Resolution on the Peaceful Resolution of the Japanese Question," "Resolution on the Unjust Decision of the United Nations to Condemn the People's Republic of China as an 'Aggressor' in Korea," and "Resolution on the Struggle for Peace in Colonial and Dependent Countries." These are new, historic, and great decisions and action programs for the world's peace-loving people to further strive for lasting world peace and shatter the US conspiracy to launch a new war. The World Peace Council solemnly condemned the shameful acts of the United Nations under US manipulation and clearly pointed out the direction of the struggle for peace. It will win the unanimous support of the world's peace-loving people and push the struggle for the cause of peace to a new high tide unprecedented in history on a broader and deeper basis. The Chinese people, who are continuing the great patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and are fighting heroically to stop the US from launching a new war, resolutely support the great resolutions of the World Peace Council and are willing to fight to the end to achieve the goals set by the resolutions.
    The success of the First Session of the World Peace Council was achieved on the basis of the widespread struggle for peace by the world's peace-loving people after the Second World Peace Congress. The Second Peace Congress's call to "never wait for peace, but must strive for peace," as well as the specific recommendations in the "Letter to the United Nations" regarding the realization of universal peace, have motivated millions of new peace supporters around the world to participate in the practical struggle for peace. The righteous actions of the Chinese people in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in their heroic battles, have seriously struck at the US aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war. However, US imperialism, disregarding the fierce opposition of the people of the world, persists in its conspiracy to expand the war, intensifies the armament of Japan and West Germany; and, disregarding the urgent appeals of the Second World Peace Congress, transforms the United Nations into a tool for launching its aggressive wars, and even manipulates the United Nations to brazenly pass a shameful decision slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in order to fulfill its conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.
    The World Peace Council demands that the United Nations respond to the Second World Congress's letter to the United Nations and the various resolutions of this Peace Council, and points out that the United Nations should return to the path stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The Peace Council, representing the opinions of the world's peace-loving people, thoroughly exposes the shameful face of the United Nations as an instrument of aggression.
    For the past five years, the United Nations has completely failed to live up to the hopes of the world's people for maintaining world peace and security, and has abandoned the lofty task stipulated in the United Nations Charter of eliminating and preventing acts of disrupting peace and aggression. In its five sessions, the United Nations has docilely acted as the tool of the US-British imperialist bloc, repeatedly obstructing all Soviet proposals aimed at maintaining world peace and security, illegally passing the establishment of the so-called "Interim Committee on Peace and Security" (Little General Assembly) to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the United Nations, illegally organizing the so-called "Temporary Commission on Korea" and the so-called "United Nations Indonesian Commission" to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea and Indonesia, helping the American and Dutch imperialist aggressors attack the people of Korea and Indonesia, and condoning the aggressive plans of the Atlantic Alliance and other plans aimed at launching a new war by the US-British bloc, carrying out the war of aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations, unreasonably refusing the representatives of the legitimate People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations agencies, and violently rejecting the proposals of the Soviet Union and India and other countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Finally, the United Nations further proved that it not only did not stop the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, but instead passed an extremely unjust and illegal "resolution," shamelessly slandering our great People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in Korea. It completely obeyed the aggressive intentions of US imperialism, and vainly attempted to use this to fool the people and drive them to shed blood for the despicable purpose of obtaining super profits for the imperialists. This shameful decision of the United Nations, as pointed out in the resolution of the World Peace Council, "seriously hinders the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and creates the threat of expanding the war in the Far East, thus also creating the danger of the outbreak of another world war." The World Peace Council represents the will of the world's peace-loving people and demands that the United Nations rescind this resolution, which is very just. Because only by rescinding this illegal decision and convening a meeting of all relevant countries can there be hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The people of the world have every right to demand and urge the United Nations to abide by the interests of world peace and rescind this illegal decision.
    The people of the whole world have seen the United Nations increasingly degenerate and can no longer tolerate it. The people of eighty countries in the world, including member states and non-member states of the United Nations, participated in the World Congress of Defenders of Peace and elected and formed the World Peace Council, heroically undertaking the responsibility for the sacred cause of maintaining world peace. The "Letter to the United Nations" of the Second Peace Congress pointed out: "The World Peace Council bears the lofty task of conforming to the vital interests of the people of all countries and ensuring solid and lasting peace. The World Peace Council will convince all mankind that, despite the difficulties that cannot be underestimated at present, it will certainly accomplish its mission." The World Peace Council, elected by representatives of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, has proven in struggle that it is a powerful organization capable of realizing the human desire for peace. It has become the command post for organized peace-loving humanity to fight for peace, and has won the trust of the people of the world who have lost confidence in the United Nations. The brilliant achievements of this session of the World Peace Council fully demonstrate that it is capable of undertaking the great task of leading the people of the world to defend peace.
    The World Peace Council demands that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, which is the urgent and important task of defending world peace at present. People know that our country, along with the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, bears the primary responsibility for world peace. This is because these five major powers play a special role in international relations. Of course, all countries in the world have a responsibility for peace, but only if these five major powers maintain peace can world peace be reliably guaranteed. This is why the United Nations, at the beginning of its organization, accepted the lessons of the failure of the League of Nations and determined that these five major powers should serve as permanent members of the Security Council and retain the power of veto; this is why the Soviet representative actively proposed the conclusion of a five-power peace pact in the fourth and fifth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.
    The conclusion of a five-power peace pact means world peace and security; the failure to conclude a five-power peace pact means that the world is still in division and confrontation, which breeds the crisis of war. In order to strengthen peace and defend security, the people of the whole world must actively strive for the rapid conclusion of a peace pact by the governments of the five major powers to avoid the threat of a new war. The government of any of the five major powers has no reason to refuse to sign this peace pact. Because any government should state its attitude towards world peace. If the government of any country refuses to participate in the conclusion of this pact, it completely proves that it does not want peace and insists on a war of aggression, and is therefore the enemy of all mankind.
    The struggle to strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact will be a serious and fierce struggle between peace-loving forces and aggressive forces. The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have consistently adhered to the policy of preventing war and maintaining peace, and both governments have more than once expressed their willingness to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries in the world. However, the US, British, and French imperialist aggressive blocs, against the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, vainly attempt to launch a new war. Therefore, the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of the United States, Britain, and France, should actively rise up, widely mobilize the masses to launch a signature campaign for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, thoroughly expose the deception and lies of the war-mongers and the reactionary governments they use against the people, and force them to accept the will of the peace-loving people and conclude a five-power peace pact.
    In the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Japanese issue, the World Peace Council resolutely condemned any attempt to make a separate peace with Japan and the crime of re-militarizing Japan. The resolution calls on the people of Asia and the Pacific region to seize the time to hold a regional conference to peacefully resolve the Japanese issue. Our people firmly support this resolution, and we firmly advocate that the relevant countries, in accordance with this resolution, promptly conclude a peace treaty with Japan, stop the revival of Japanese militarism, and thoroughly smash the plan of the US aggressors to launch a new war. This, like the peaceful resolution of the German issue, is an important step in defending world peace.
    The First Session of the World Peace Council has made extremely great contributions to the world peace movement, pointing out the current direction and goals for the world's peace supporters. We, the Chinese people, are full of confidence and are determined to work with all peace-loving and just people of the world to realize all the resolutions of the World Peace Council, persist in our struggle, thoroughly smash the conspiracy of US imperialism to launch a new war, and defend lasting world peace.

　　为争取世界和平而斗争到底
　　——拥护世界和平理事会的伟大决议
    世界和平理事会第一届会议已于本月二十六日在柏林胜利闭幕了。会议在讨论了关于二届世界和大纲领执行情况、关于以和平方式解决德国和日本问题以后，一致通过了《关于联合国的决议》，《关于缔结和平公约的宣言》，《关于以和平方式解决德国问题的决议》，《关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议》，《关于联合国通过谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的不公正的决定之决议》，《关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议》等十项文件。这是世界爱好和平人民进一步争取世界持久和平、粉碎美国发动新战争阴谋的新的历史性的伟大决定和行动纲领。世界和平理事会严正地斥责了在美国操纵下的联合国的可耻行为，并明确地指出了争取和平斗争的方向。它将赢得世界爱好和平人民一致的拥护与广泛的支持，把保卫和平事业的斗争在更广大与更深入的基础上推进到历史上从未有过的新高潮。在继续展开抗美援朝伟大爱国运动并为制止美国发动新战争而英勇斗争的中国人民，坚决拥护世界和平理事会的伟大决议，愿为实现决议所规定的目标而斗争到底。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议的成功，是在世界第二届和平大会召开后世界爱好和平人民广泛展开争取和平斗争的基础上取得的。二届和平大会“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”的号召，以及《致联合国书》中关于实现普遍和平的具体建议，推动了全世界千百万新的和平拥护者参加了争取和平的实际斗争。中国人民抗美援朝的正义行动，和中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军英勇作战所取得的辉煌胜利，已经严重地打击了美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋。但是美国帝国主义仍然不顾世界人民的激烈反对，坚持它扩大战争的阴谋计划，加紧进行武装日本和西德；并且不顾二届世界和平大会的迫切呼吁，而把联合国变成为它发动侵略战争的工具，甚至操纵联合国悍然通过了诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的可耻决定，以遂其扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    世界和平理事会要求联合国应对二届世界和大致联合国书及本届和平理事会的各项决议表示它的意见，并且指出联合国应该回到联合国宪章所规定的道路上去。和平理事会代表世界爱好和平人民的意见，彻底地揭露了联合国已成为侵略工具的可耻的面目。
    五年来的联合国，完全辜负了世界人民所赋予它的维护世界和平与安全的希望，放弃了联合国宪章所规定给它的消除与制止破坏和平和侵略行为的崇高任务。联合国在其所举行过的五届会议中，驯服地充当美英帝国主义集团的御用机构，屡次阻挠了苏联旨在维护世界和平与安全的一切建议，非法地通过成立所谓“和平安全临时委员会”（小型联大），以破坏联合国的大国一致原则，非法组织所谓“朝鲜临时委员会”和所谓“联合国印尼委员会”，以干涉朝鲜和印尼的内政，帮助美荷帝国主义侵略者对朝鲜和印尼人民的进攻，并且纵容美英集团旨在发动新战争的大西洋联盟等侵略计划，以联合国的名义替美帝国主义进行侵略朝鲜的战争，无理拒绝合法的中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国机构，横暴地否决了苏联及印度等国和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。最后，联合国更证明了它自己不但不制止美国帝国主义的侵略罪行，反而通过了极不公正的非法的“决议”，无耻地诬蔑我伟大的中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”。完全服从了美帝国主义的侵略意图，妄想借此愚弄人民，驱迫他们去为帝国主义者获得超额利润的卑劣目的而流血。联合国的这一可耻决定，正如世界和平理事会决议中所指出的，是“严重地妨碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，并造成扩大远东战争的威胁，因而也造成另一次世界大战爆发的危险。”世界和平理事会代表世界和平人民的意志，要求联合国取消这个决议，是非常正当的。因为只有取消这一非法决定，召开一切有关国家的会议，才有和平解决朝鲜问题的希望。世界人民有充分的权利要求和督促联合国服从世界和平的利益，取消这一非法决定。
    全世界人民看到了联合国日益堕落下去，早已不能忍耐了。包括联合国会员国和非会员国的世界八十个国家的人民，参加了世界保卫和平大会，并选出与组成了世界和平理事会，英勇地将维护世界和平的神圣事业的责任担当起来。在第二届和平大会《致联合国书》中即指出：“世界和平理事会担负着符合各国人民切身利益、确保稳固与持久和平的崇高任务。世界和平理事会将使全人类相信：尽管目前存在着不能过低估计的困难，但它必将完成它的使命。”由亿万和平人民的代表选举出来的世界和平理事会，在斗争中已经证实它是能够实现人类和平意愿的强大组织。它已成为有组织的爱好和平的人类为和平而斗争的司令台，取得了对联合国业已丧失信心的全世界人民的信任。世界和平理事会本届会议的光辉成就，完全表明了它足以担当起领导世界人民保卫和平的伟大任务。
    世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约，这就是当前保卫世界和平的迫切的重要任务。人们知道，我国与苏联及美、英、法等五大国对于世界和平是负有主要责任的。这是因为这五大国在国际关系中起着特别的作用。当然，世界上所有的国家都对和平负有责任，但是，必须是这五个大国维护和平，世界和平才有可靠的保障。这也就是为什么联合国在筹组之初就接受了国际联盟的失败经验，而确定以这五大国担任安全理事会的常任理事且保有否决权的缘故；这也就是为什么苏联代表在联合国第四、五两届大会中都积极提议缔结五大国和平公约的缘故。
    缔结五大国和平公约，就意味着世界和平与安全；不缔结五大国和平公约，则世界仍处于分裂对立，就孕育着战争危机。全世界人民为了加强和平与保卫安全，就必须积极努力，争取五大国政府迅速缔结和平公约，以避免新战争的威胁。五大国的任何一国的政府，没有丝毫的理由拒绝签订这一和平公约。因为任何政府均应表明它对世界和平所抱的态度。无论任何一国的政府拒绝参加缔结这一公约，就完全证明它是不要和平，坚持侵略战争，因而也就是全人类的公敌。
    争取五大国缔结和平公约的斗争，将是爱好和平的力量与侵略势力之间的一场严重的激烈的斗争。中华人民共和国和苏联政府一贯地坚持奉行防止战争和维护和平的政策，并且两国政府都不止一次地表示了愿与世界各国人民和平共处的愿望。但是，美、英、法帝国主义侵略集团则违背世界人民的和平意愿，妄图发动新的战争。因此，全世界各国人民，尤其是美、英、法三国的人民，应该积极奋起，广泛动员群众展开关于缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动，彻底揭露战争贩子及其所利用的反动政府对人民的欺骗谎言，迫使它们接受和平人民的意志，缔结五大国和平公约。
    世界和平理事会在关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议中，坚决谴责了任何与日本单独媾和的企图及使日本重新军事化的罪行。决议号召亚洲和太平洋区的人民，争取时间举行区域会议，以和平方式解决日本问题。我国人民坚决支持这个决议，我们坚决主张各有关国家，按照这个决议，迅速缔结对日和约，制止日本军国主义的复活，彻底地粉碎美国侵略者发动新战争的计划。这与和平解决德国问题同样是保卫世界和平的重要步骤。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议，对世界保卫和平运动做出了极伟大的贡献，它给世界的和平拥护者指出了当前奋斗的方向和目标。我们中国人民充满信心，决与全世界爱好和平正义的人类共同为实现世界和平理事会的全部决议，坚持奋斗，彻底粉碎美帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋，保卫世界的持久和平。
