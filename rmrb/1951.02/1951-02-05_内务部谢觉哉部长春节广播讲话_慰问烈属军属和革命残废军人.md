Minister of Interior Affairs Xie Juezai's Spring Festival Broadcast Speech to the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, 1951. The text of the speech is as follows:

Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers!

The Spring Festival of 1951 is a Spring Festival in which the Chinese people are striving for peace and winning great victories, and it is a Spring Festival in which the Chinese people and the Korean people are winning great victories in resisting American imperialist aggression in the East. On behalf of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country, I extend to you my cordial and warm greetings!

In the past year, after our military victory, we overcame economic and financial difficulties, overcame natural disasters, carried out land reform in the new areas, established democratic systems at all levels, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. At the same time, we basically eliminated bandits, making social order increasingly stable. These victories were achieved under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party, and through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, especially the heroic battles, unyielding spirit, and the great patriotic spirit of your children—the People's Liberation Army and all disabled revolutionary soldiers—over the past few decades, advancing wave upon wave.

American imperialism and its vassal states are not reconciled to their defeat and the victory of the Chinese people. They attempt to undermine the victory of the Chinese people and extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Asian people. They extended their bloody hands to occupy our Taiwan and invade our neighboring country, Korea. This proves that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, and also the enemy of the people of the world. The victorious Chinese people will not allow American imperialism to invade again. The entire Chinese people, in order to defend the security of the motherland and world peace, launched a vigorous movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, defeated MacArthur's so-called "general offensive," and successively liberated the vast cities and villages of the Korean people, such as Pyongyang and Seoul. The failure of American imperialism is doomed, and the Chinese people have made a great contribution to the cause of peace.

Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers! In the Chinese people's liberation cause and in the battles against imperialist aggression, you have contributed your children, husbands, and relatives. They have contributed their blood and health to the cause of the people's revolution. The Chinese people will never forget the martyrs who sacrificed and contributed their precious lives for the revolution. They will be immortal! The Chinese people also always remember the disabled revolutionary soldiers who were gloriously wounded in the revolutionary war and the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who are standing on the front lines of national defense to defend the motherland. Their heroic fighting spirit and lofty revolutionary qualities will always be sincerely loved by the Chinese people. The Chinese people are honored to have such excellent children. The people will always be grateful and respectful for your cultivation, education, and encouragement of them.

Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers! The People's Government and the people always care most intimately about your production and living conditions. In 1950, preferential treatment work throughout the country generally achieved results: five preferential treatment regulations were promulgated; a large number of martyrs' families and soldiers' families were introduced to jobs and organized production in cities; in rural areas, the work of helping with farming and farming on behalf of others was strengthened and launched by the masses; in disaster areas, more attention was paid to the lives of martyrs' families, soldiers' families, and disabled revolutionary soldiers; coupled with the timely and appropriate material assistance from the People's Government, the lives of the vast majority of martyrs' families, soldiers' families, and disabled revolutionary soldiers were no lower than the living standards of the general masses in the local area, but our work still has shortcomings, and individual martyrs' families, soldiers' families, and disabled revolutionary soldiers still have some difficulties. Now, we are urging the people's governments at all levels and calling on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen preferential treatment work, continue to study and improve methods such as introducing employment, organizing production, and farming on behalf of others, and strive to ensure that the lives of every martyr's family, soldier's family, and disabled revolutionary soldier are no lower than the general level of the local masses.

Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers! You are respected by the people of the whole country. When the motherland needs each of us to contribute our strength, you will surely continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition with a high degree of patriotism, play a leading exemplary role in various patriotic movements, guard against arrogance and rashness, unite the masses, jointly do a good job in production and construction, crack down on remaining bandits and secret agents, and encourage your relatives to kill the enemy and perform meritorious services, and strive to consolidate and develop the victory of the people.

　　内务部谢觉哉部长春节广播讲话
    慰问烈属军属和革命残废军人
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长一九五一年春节向革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人广播讲话。讲词如下：亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人同志们！
    一九五一年的春节，是中国人民争取和平赢得伟大胜利的春节，是中国人民和朝鲜人民在东方抵抗美帝国主义侵略赢得伟大胜利的春节。我谨代表中央人民政府政务院和全国人民向你们致以亲切而热烈的慰问！
    在过去的一年中，我们在军事胜利之后，克服了经济与财政的困难，克服了灾荒，开展了新区的土地改革，建立了各级民主制度，巩固了人民民主专政。同时又基本上剿灭了土匪，使社会秩序日益安定。这些胜利是在毛主席、中央人民政府、中国共产党的正确领导下和全国人民的共同努力，特别是你们的子弟——人民解放军和全体革命残废军人几十年来的英勇战斗，不屈不挠，前仆后继的伟大爱国主义精神所创造的。
    美帝国主义及其仆从国家不甘心于他们的失败和中国人民的胜利，他们企图破坏中国人民的胜利，扑灭亚洲人民的革命火焰。他们伸出了血手侵占我国的台湾，侵略我国的邻邦朝鲜。这证明美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，也即是世界人民的敌人。胜利的中国人民是不容许美帝国主义再来侵略的。全中国人民为了保卫祖国安全与世界和平，展开轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已给了美帝国主义以沉痛的打击，击溃了麦克阿瑟的所谓“总攻势”，相继解放朝鲜人民的平壤、汉城等广大城市与乡村，美帝国主义的失败是注定了的，中国人民对和平事业做了伟大的贡献。
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人同志们！你们在中国人民历次的解放事业中，在反帝国主义侵略的战斗中，贡献出自己的儿女、丈夫和亲人，他们为人民革命事业贡献出自己的鲜血与健康，中国人民永不忘记为革命牺牲，贡献出自己宝贵生命的烈士们，他们永垂不朽！中国人民也时刻怀念在革命战争中光荣负伤的革命残废军人和站在国防前线保卫祖国的人民解放军指战员们，他们英勇的战斗精神和崇高的革命品质永远为中国人民所衷心爱戴。中国人民因为有这样优秀的儿女而感到光荣。你们对他们的培养、教育和鼓励，人民也将永远感激与敬爱。
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人同志们！你们的生产和生活情况人民政府与人民始终是最亲切的关怀着。一九五○年全国各地的优抚工作普遍地有了成绩：颁布了五种优抚条例：在城市中介绍了大批烈士家属和军人家属谋得职业，组织了生产；在乡村中，加强和发动了群众的助耕代耕工作；在灾区是更重视了烈士家属和军人家属、革命残废军人的生活；加上人民政府及时的适当的实物补助，使广大烈士家属和军人家属和革命残废军人的生活不低于当地一般群众的生活水平，但我们的工作还有缺点，个别烈士家属和军人家属和革命残废军人还有某些困难。现在，我们督促各级人民政府并号召全国人民继续加强优抚工作，继续研究改进介绍职业与组织生产和代耕等办法，求得每个烈士家属和军人家属及革命残废军人的生活不低于当地群众一般的水平。
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人同志们！你们是受全国人民尊敬的，当祖国需要我们每个人贡献出自己力量的时候，你们一定会以高度爱国主义精神继续发扬光荣的革命传统，在各种爱国运动中起带头的模范作用，戒骄戒躁，团结群众，共同做好生产建设工作，打击残存土匪特务，鼓励自己的亲人杀敌立功，为巩固与发展人民的胜利而奋斗。
