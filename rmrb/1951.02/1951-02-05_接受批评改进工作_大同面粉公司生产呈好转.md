    Response to Criticism from the People's Daily

    Accepting Criticism and Improving Work
    Datong Flour Company's Production Shows Improvement
    To the Editor:
    We have examined the criticism of our factory made by Comrade Zhang Yi in the "Letters from Readers" section of your newspaper on January 11th. During the examination, we found that most of Comrade Zhang's points were correct and very helpful for our factory's future production. We should express our gratitude to Comrade Zhang!
    Indeed, last year's production at our factory had many shortcomings and difficulties because we had not yet fully grasped the essentials of industrial production. However, we are confident in overcoming them. We have made new arrangements for the entire production in 1951. Based on the lessons learned last year, we have decided to hire technicians this year to completely prevent and eliminate accidents. Judging from the over-fulfillment of our task in January, we can guarantee the completion of the annual production target. We will continue to report various production situations to you in the future. As for Comrade Zhang's criticism that the factory lost 125 million yuan in nine months, this is slightly different from the facts, as explained below:
    From April 15th to December (eight and a half months) last year, the total revenue of the factory was 896 million yuan, and the total expenditure was 940 million yuan (including 643 million yuan for the real value difference and interest on bank loans, 141 million yuan for cost differences, and 156 million yuan for depreciation of buildings and machinery and start-up costs). The actual loss was 44 million yuan.
         Datong Flour Company

### 接受批评改进工作  大同面粉公司生产呈好转

    接受批评改进工作        
    大同面粉公司生产呈好转
    编辑同志：
    贵报一月十一日“读者来信”刊载张毅同志对本厂的批评，我们对此已作了检查。在检查中，我们认为张同志所提各节，大部分是对的；对本厂今后生产上的帮助是很大的。我们应该对张同志表示感谢！
    的确，本厂去年的生产，由于我们还没很好地掌握了工业生产的要领，以致产生很多缺点和困难。但我们有信心克服它。在一九五一年我们对整个生产已作了新的布置。并接受去年的经验教训，决定在今年聘请技师，彻底防止和消灭事故。根据一月份超额完成任务的情形来看，全年生产任务是可以保证完成的。今后我们将不断向你们报导各种生产情况。至张同志批评中提到本厂九个月中亏本一亿二千五百万元一节，与事实略有出入，特说明如下：
    本厂从去年四月十五日至十二月八个半月中，生产总收入额为八亿九千六百万元，支出总额为九亿四千万元（包括银行贷款折实差价及利息六亿四千三百万元，成本差异一亿四千一百万元，房屋机器折旧及开办费一亿五千六百万元。），实际损失额为四千四百万元。
