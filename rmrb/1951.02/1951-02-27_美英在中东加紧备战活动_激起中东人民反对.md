Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The US and British imperialists have recently intensified their conspiratorial activities in preparing for war in Middle Eastern countries, arousing strong opposition from the people of all countries.

　　In Syria and Lebanon, a powerful mass movement has emerged against foreign interference in internal affairs and the threat of foreign occupation. According to the Beirut "Oriental Daily" Damascus dispatch, the Syrian President and Prime Minister receive letters every day protesting the transformation of the country into a bridgehead for US-British aggression. These letters resolutely oppose any total or partial foreign occupation, demand struggle to realize the national demands of the Arab people, and denounce those who intend to give foreign countries military bases and pave the way for foreign occupation. To date, more than 20,000 people have signed protest letters in Damascus, Hama, Homs, and other cities. When British Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Land Forces, Robertson, recently traveled to Middle Eastern countries in an attempt to encircle the Middle East into an anti-Soviet Mediterranean group and arrived in Syria, the people of Damascus, despite police attacks, held huge protest demonstrations. Demonstrators shouted slogans against imperialist war preparations in the Middle East. Subsequently, when Robertson arrived in Israel on the 20th, people in the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, held demonstrations to protest. The Israeli Peace League also held a protest demonstration in Tel Aviv on the 21st. Demonstrators in Tel Aviv burned Robertson's portrait in the streets and distributed leaflets calling on the people to rise up in opposition. Progressive public opinion in Israel has also unanimously denounced Robertson's sinister conspiracy. At the same time, progressive Israeli parliamentarians are demanding a debate in parliament on Robertson's visit and are filing charges against the government for holding secret military talks with the US and British war blocs.

　　美英在中东加紧备战活动
　  激起中东人民反对
    【新华社二十五日讯】美英帝国主义最近在中东国家加紧准备战争的阴谋活动，激起了各国人民强烈的反对。
    在叙利亚和黎巴嫩，已经涌起强大的群众运动，反对外国干涉内政和外国占领的威胁。据黎巴嫩“东方报”大马士革消息，叙利亚总统和总理每天都接到抗议把国家变成美英侵略桥头堡的信件，这些信件坚决反对任何全部的或局部的外国占领，要求为实现阿拉伯人民的民族要求而斗争，并责难打算给外国以军事基地并为外国占领开辟道路的那些人们。到目前为止已有两万多人在大马士革、哈马、荷姆斯及其他城市的抗议书上签名。当英国驻中东陆军总司令罗伯逊最近为企图把中东圈入反苏的地中海集团，赴中东各国活动而到达叙利亚时，大马士革人民不顾警察的袭击，举行了巨大的抗议示威。示威者高呼反对帝国主义在中东准备战争的口号。其后，当罗伯逊于二十日抵以色列时，以色列首都特拉维夫和耶路撒冷两地人民分别举行了示威游行，表示抗议。以色列和平联盟并于二十一日在特拉维夫举行了抗议示威。特拉维夫的示威者把罗伯逊的画像在大街上烧毁，并散发传单，号召人民群起反对。以色列的进步舆论也一致痛斥罗伯逊的罪恶阴谋。同时，以色列进步议员们正在议会中要求就罗伯逊的访问举行辩论，并提出控诉政府和美英战争集团举行秘密的军事会谈。
