In the philosophy category are Chairman Mao Zedong's "On Practice," and "The Ancient Chinese Philosopher Lao Tzu and His Doctrine" by the Soviet philosopher Yang Xing Shun, who retranslated Lao Tzu's "Tao Te Ching." In the literary category are Lu Xun's novel "My Old Home" and other short stories and essays, Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Family Village" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," Cao Ming's "Motive Power," Liu Baiyu's "Invincible Three Warriors," and "A Collection of Chinese Short Stories" which includes works by Zhao Shuli and others. In the travelogue category are Simonov's "Fighting China" (in Russian and Ukrainian), Fenogenov's "In New China" (a collection of paintings and texts), Chichitkina's "Liberated China," and Nikitin's "Beijing." In the history category are translations from Chinese of modern and contemporary Chinese history, Yermashev's "Light Shines on China" (from the end of the Ming Dynasty to the present), Karamusha's "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and Nikiforov, Ehrenburg and Yuryev's "The Revolution of the Chinese People" (from the Great Revolution of 1927 to the founding of the People's Republic of China). In addition, the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge has published a series of pamphlets, covering everything from the birth of the Chinese Communist Party to the construction achievements of the People's Republic of China. The Moscow Oriental University, the Oriental Department of Leningrad University, and the History Department of Moscow University have all published outlines and manuals for the study of Chinese language, history, and geography.
