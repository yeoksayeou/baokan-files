　　[Xinhua News Agency report] The China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Jiusan Society, the China National Federation of Natural Science Societies, the China Association for Science and Technology, and people from all over the country have issued statements or held rallies and demonstrations to oppose the United Nations General Assembly's illegal adoption of the US proposal to slander our country and to oppose the US conspiracy to rearm Japan.

　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued two written statements on the 6th, protesting against the US imperialists' manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass a proposal to slander our country and denouncing the US imperialists' conspiracy to arm Japan. The written statement protesting against the US imperialists' slander of our country pointed out: The US imperialists' arrogant proposal, which was brazenly passed by the United Nations despite the wishes of many countries, makes the countries and people who have always fought to defend world peace more clearly recognize that the US imperialists are persisting in their criminal policy of expanding the war of aggression. Therefore, the entire peace and democracy camp will unite and act more closely to resolutely oppose and stop the US imperialists' war of aggression. The written statement opposing the US imperialists' arming of Japan stated: All members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy pledge to be with the people of the whole country, Asia, and the world under the leadership of the Central People's Government to fight to the end to smash the United States' separate peace and rearming of Japan.

　　The Jiusan Society issued a written statement on the 2nd of this month. The statement stated: The US imperialist bandits' manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass a proposal to slander our country shows that the US imperialists have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but are determined to act recklessly to the end and determined to be enemies of the Korean people and the vast number of peace-loving people in the world. Regarding the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the statement stated: The US imperialists' conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan completely violates the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, and the basic policy on Japan after its surrender stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission. We Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate such a perfidious and illegal act. The written statement concluded: The Chinese people, the Korean people, the people of various countries in the Far East, and the peace-loving people of the world must unite closely to oppose the US imperialist bandits' expansion of the war of aggression, arming of Japan, and conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan! We Chinese people must further unite to smash the US aggressors' conspiracy to slander and defame us through the United Nations, strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and actively support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting the US aggressor troops.

　　The China National Federation of Natural Science Societies and the China Association for Science and Technology jointly issued a declaration on the 5th, protesting against the US imperialists' attempt to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan. The declaration said: The US imperialists' arrogant conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan not only violates previous international treaties and disregards the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the Chinese people in defeating Japanese imperialism, but also fully demonstrates the US imperialists' conspiracy to launch a world war. We natural scientists of all China resolutely oppose the US imperialists' arrogant attempt to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan, and fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. We must unite with natural scientists all over the world, especially Japanese natural scientists, to launch a movement against the United States' separate peace with Japan and arming of Japan, and strive to conclude a just and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

　　The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than 1.5 million workers in the Northeast, issued a statement denouncing the US imperialists for manipulating the voting machine in the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass a resolution slandering China, saying: Northeast workers will fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, comfort their families, and step up production competitions to build a strong national defense force and strive to finally defeat the US aggression forces. More than 40,000 workers from more than 20 industrial systems in Shenyang held a rally in the city government square on the morning of the 5th. At the meeting, Zhang Like, chairman of the city federation of trade unions, delivered a speech to the workers, calling on the city's workers to further carry out patriotic production competitions, fully support national defense construction, oppose the US imperialists' slander of our country and arming of Japan, and completely smash the US imperialist aggression to defend peace in Asia and the world. After the meeting passed a message of respect to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers, a demonstration began.

　　Local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the Democratic National Construction Association in Shanghai and the Nanjing Federation of Trade Unions have all issued statements, unanimously denouncing the US imperialists' slander of our country. Preparatory committees of the Anhui South District Federation of Trade Unions, the Anhui South District Women's Federation, and other people's organizations have also issued statements denouncing the US imperialists' aggressive conspiracy.

　　The local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the Democratic National Construction Association in Wuhan jointly issued a statement saying: This absurd and shameless proposal of the US imperialists fully exposes their determination to deliberately expand the war of aggression, proving that they are the deadly enemies of the Chinese and Korean people and the deadly enemies of the peace-loving people in Asia and the world. The Hubei Provincial Farmers Association firmly stated in a written statement: The 20 million farmers in Hubei Province will use practical actions to support and support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

　　Chu Tunan, chairman of the Southwest General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, said: The people of Southwest China will launch a larger anti-American aggression movement to respond to the slander of the US imperialists. Twenty-three representatives of various ethnic groups attending the Second Meeting of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission on behalf of the people of various ethnic minorities in Southwest China held a symposium on the 3rd for this purpose. The people of all walks of life in Chengdu, Sichuan West District, held a demonstration of 15,000 people on the afternoon of the 3rd with incomparable anger. The Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union of Sichuan West and Chengdu, the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Working Committee of the China Democratic League in Southern Sichuan have all issued protest letters or statements.

　　The families of volunteers in Xi'an and Lanzhou who volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the anti-US struggle felt infinite anger at the slander of the US imperialists. The Dihua Branch of the Chinese Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Xinjiang People's Democratic League, the Dihua City Federation of Trade Unions, and 15 other units jointly issued a statement saying: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the 3rd represents the justice and dignity of the entire Chinese people and speaks the words that the entire Chinese people want to say. We, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, express our firm support.
