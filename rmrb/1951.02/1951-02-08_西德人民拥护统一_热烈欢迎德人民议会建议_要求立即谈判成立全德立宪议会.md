Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: TASS reports: The German Democratic Republic's People's Parliament's telegram to the Bonn Federal Parliament, requesting the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly to seek the unification of Germany, has been warmly embraced by the people of West Germany. The Stuttgart newspaper *People's Voice* published an article stating: "It is generally recognized that this action by the People's Parliament proves the seriousness of its intentions. The road is now open. Negotiations should begin. This is the opinion of the people."

The Committee for the Struggle for German Reunification of Waldenburg, Baden, sent a telegram to the Bonn Federal Parliament stating: "The People's Parliament's proposal is so magnanimous that anyone who still loves the country and cherishes the lives of the German people cannot allow the proposal to begin negotiations on the All-German question to be rejected again." The committee also sent a telegram to the Chairman of the People's Parliament of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, stating: "The People's Parliament's statement is universally welcomed in Waldenburg-Baden. This step by the People's Parliament makes a decisive contribution to ensuring world peace and the peaceful reunification of Germany."

Bourgeois newspapers in Stuttgart, Heidelberg, Mannheim and other places have also published the People's Parliament's statement to the Bonn Federal Parliament under striking headlines.

In Düsseldorf (British occupation zone), thousands of residents held protest rallies against Adenauer's rejection of Prime Minister Grotewohl's November 30th proposal, and passed resolutions demanding that Adenauer immediately begin negotiations to establish an All-German Constituent Assembly.
