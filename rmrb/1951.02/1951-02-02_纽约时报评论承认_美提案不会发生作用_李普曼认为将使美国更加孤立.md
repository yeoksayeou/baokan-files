Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st, Electric Dispatch: The "New York Times," in a commentary on the U.S. proposal condemning China as an "aggressor," passed by the U.S. voting machine in the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee this morning, began by stating that this proposal would not work.

The "New York Times" stated that it "cannot expect" this proposal to "end the Korean War," nor can it "resolve the various Far Eastern issues that have not yet been resolved," nor can it "change" the "military and economic situation" of the Chinese People's Government.

In this light, it seems that this proposal is unnecessary. But the "New York Times" has different ideas. The newspaper claimed that this proposal would "see this case through to the end." "That is to say, this proposal once again assures the world that the American leaders are reasonable. Second, this proposal will end the long period of hesitation and equivocation." Here, the "New York Times" is probably referring to the fact that America's allies are unwilling to wholeheartedly and unconditionally support Washington's war policy. But how many active soldiers the United States can find among the countries that voted in favor of this American proposal remains to be seen.

The "New York Times" then assured readers: "The passage of this proposal will boost the morale of the United Nations forces in Korea and legitimize their position in Korea." If it is about boosting morale, then a piece of paper is not enough, and much more needs to be done. As for legitimizing MacArthur's position in Korea, the United States has been insisting for seven months that MacArthur's position in Korea is completely legitimate, so why "legitimize" it again now? The obvious fact is that Washington hopes to "legitimize" its small-scale war in Korea through a major war, and the United States needs to continue the war at any cost. The "New York Times" said it very bluntly: "Finally, the passage of this proposal can greatly reduce the risk of a final settlement."

The "risk" of ending the war is obviously very great, so the American diplomatic and military representatives spent several weeks persuading and intimidating the governments of forty-odd countries to support an undertaking that they knew would be disastrous.

The latest act of intimidation was Senator Connally's statement last weekend. He said that India would no longer be able to obtain American wheat for its starving millions as it had in the past. This was hint enough for those governments that rely on Washington's purse – a point also supported by the less-than-diplomatic private conversations of American embassies in various countries.

The situation now is: the defendant is not present, and the self-appointed judge is about to read the verdict, but the existence of this defendant is not recognized by this judge. This method seems to be a cut above the "lynching" in the American South. Can Mississippi's laws be applied internationally? This is another question that, if it does not cause a headache for the White House, causes many people in Washington to have a headache.

Lippmann, ever since the late J.P. Morgan's head, Lamont, took him around the world to prove to him the sins of liberalism, has never thought for himself, but he wrote last Monday that this proposal not only "estranges us from Britain, but also alienates all our important allies from us, even Canada."

Lippmann wrote: "The pressure of the masses has now erupted in Congress because our people hate the miserable situation of the American army in Korea. Our people feel that since such a war no longer has any hope of victory, and can no longer achieve the goals it was fighting for, but still allows American soldiers to suffer in it, that is intolerable... They naturally and rightly feel that there are some decisive things that they do not know. And they will not know these things. They have the right to expect their government to tell them what this is all about. Yet their government has told them nothing. Day after day passes, and the casualties continue, and young men are drafted to fill their places."

"The proposal has passed, so what now?" This question was asked to Indian representative Rau this morning, and Rau, looking at the American delegation, replied: "It will cause a great deal of trouble."

### 纽约时报评论承认  美提案不会发生作用  李普曼认为将使美国更加孤立

　　纽约时报评论承认
    美提案不会发生作用       
    李普曼认为将使美国更加孤立
    【新华社一日讯】电通社布拉格一月三十一日电：《纽约时报》于评论今晨在联合国大会政治委员会中由美国表决机器所通过的谴责中国为“侵略者”的美国提案时，开始即称：这项提案不会发生作用。
    《纽约时报》称：“不能期望”这项提案“结束朝鲜战争”，也“不能解决尚未得到解决的各种远东问题”，也不能“改变”中国人民政府的“军事和经济的情况”。
    这样看来，似乎是不需要这项提案了。但《纽约时报》却有着不同的想法。该报称：这项提案将使“这案子的处理贯彻到底”。“这就是说，这项提案再一次向全世界保证：美国领袖们是看得出道理来的。第二，这项提案将结束长期的犹豫和支吾。”这里，《纽约时报》大概是指美国的盟友们不愿全心全意地无条件地支持华盛顿的战争政策一事说的。但美国究竟能在投票赞成这项美国提案的各国中找到多少积极的兵士，却还待以后的事实来证明。
    《纽约时报》继而向读者保证：“这项提案的通过，将使在朝鲜的联合国军士气为之一振，并且使他们在朝鲜的地位合法化了。”如说振奋士气，那末，一纸提案是不够的，还需要作许多事。至于使麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的地位合法化，美国七个月以来一向咬定说麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的地位是完全合法的，现在为什么再加以“合法化”呢？明显的事实是：华盛顿希望通过一次大的战争，把它在朝鲜的小规模战争予以“合法化”，并且美国需要不惜任何代价使战争继续下去。《纽约时报》说得很露骨：“最后说一句，这项提案的通过可以大大减少最后解决的风险。”
    终止战争的“风险”显然是非常大的，因此美国的外交和军事代表们花了好几个星期，对四十来个国家的政府进行劝说和恐吓，要它们支持一个它们明知将有灾难的事业。
    最后一次的恐吓行为就是参议员康纳利在上周末的声明。他说，印度将不可能再像过去一样，为其饥饿的千百万人取得美国小麦。对于那些倚靠华盛顿钱袋的政府，这已是一个足够的暗示了——美国驻各国大使馆比较非外交性质的私人谈话也都支持这一点。
    现在的情形是：被告没有在场，而自命的法官要宣读判决书，但是这位被告的存在却是这位法官所不承认的。这种办法似乎比美国南方的“私加刑罚”还要高明一筹。密士失必的法律是否能够搬到国际上来应用呢？这又是一个问题，在华盛顿，这问题如果不使白宫大伤脑筋，却有许多人为这事而大伤脑筋的。
    李普曼自从已故摩根公司的首脑拉蒙特带着他周游世界，向他证明自由主义的罪过之后，从来就不曾为自己打算过，但他上星期一却写道：这个提案不仅“使我们和英国隔膜起来，而且也要使我们全体重要盟友和我们疏远，即使加拿大也在其内”。
    李普曼写道：“群众的压力目前已在国会内爆发了，这是因为我国人民憎恨美军在朝鲜的凄惨的情况而引起的。我国人民觉得，这样一个战争既然再也没有胜利的希望，再也不能达成这次战争所争取的目标，但是还让美国士兵在其中受苦，那是不能容忍的……他们很自然也很正当地觉得，有一些决定性的东西是他们所不知道的。他们也不会知道这些东西的。他们有权利期待他们的政府告诉他们这究竟是什么一回事。然而他们的政府却什么也没有告诉他们。日子一天天地过去，死伤仍然在继续着，年青人被征召来补充他们的缺额。”
    “这个提案是通过了，现在又怎么样呢？”今天早晨有人向印度代表劳氏提出这问题，当时劳氏眼睛看着美国代表团回答说：“将大伤脑筋”。
