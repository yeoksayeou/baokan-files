     Gao Fengge Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment for Bribery
    Judge Li Fengzhi Praised for Rejecting Bribe
To the Editor:
    Li Fengzhi, a judge from the Judicial Section of Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, was recently handling a homicide case in Qilidian, Anyang County. Gao Fengge, the brother of the murderer Gao Fengqi, attempted to bribe Li Fengzhi with 250,000 yuan through a third party. He also invited Li to drink and dine, attempting to have Li Fengzhi "show leniency." Li Fengzhi immediately and sternly refused and reported the matter to his superiors. In addition, he sent a letter home, warning his family to guard against bribery from lawbreakers. The Anyang County People's Government issued a circular to commend Li Fengzhi's excellent qualities as a people's judicial worker and sentenced Gao Fengge, the briber in the case, to one year in prison, confiscating the bribe money.
    Currently, some lawbreakers are still attempting to use despicable bribery to buy off the staff of the People's Government. Therefore, I hope you will publish this letter to raise the vigilance of the People's Government staff and give a warning to lawbreakers who attempt to bribe.

     高凤阁行贿被判徒刑一年
    审判员李凤至拒贿受表扬编辑同志：
    平原省安阳县司法科审判员李凤至，最近审理该县七里店一件凶杀案时，杀人犯高凤启之兄高凤阁，竟托人以二十五万元贿赂李凤至，并邀请李喝酒吃饭，企图叫李凤至“高抬贵手”。李凤至当即严词拒绝，并把这事报告了上级。此外，又寄信通知家中，防备不法者行贿。安阳县人民政府对李凤至这种人民司法工作者的优良品质，特予通报表扬；并判处该案行贿犯高凤阁徒刑一年，没收其贿款。
    在目前，还有一些不法分子企图用卑劣的贿赂手段来收买人民政府的工作人员。因此，我希望你们把这封信登出来，以提高人民政府工作人员的警惕，并给企图行贿的不法分子一个警告。
