　　Northeast Hegang Fifth Mine, Fifth Inclined Shaft
    Improved Coal Mining Method Leads to Accident-Free Year

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Fifth Inclined Shaft of the Fifth Mine of the Hegang Mining Bureau, originally poorly equipped and prone to accidents, has achieved safe production without any casualties in the past year due to strengthened safety measures.

    The Fifth Inclined Shaft is the main shaft of the Fifth Mine, employing four to five hundred workers and achieving a daily output of up to 1,200 tons at its peak. Due to the predatory mining practices of the enemy and puppet regime in the past, which prioritized high output at the expense of worker safety, the engineering equipment in the various faces and tunnels within the mine did not meet standards. Coupled with the unique coal mining methods, accidents occurred frequently. The workers harbored a pervasive "fatalistic" mindset, believing that "mining coal inevitably leads to death." During the safety campaign last year, the mine's leading cadres determined that the key to safe production lay in improving the coal mining methods. However, this initially faced resistance from the workers' conservative thinking. Although the faces and coal mining methods left behind by the enemy and puppet regime posed a risk of injury or death with the slightest carelessness, they were less strenuous and had higher efficiency. The workers were accustomed to them and unwilling to change. Later, through the vigorous propaganda, education and mobilization efforts of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in the mine, the slogan "Rather mine a few tons of coal less than allow a single injury or death" was put forward. A group of workers and cadres were sent to the Xi'an Coal Mine to learn regular retreat mining. After they returned, they carefully publicized and introduced it, which initially dispelled the conservative thinking that resisted change. The mine administration also guaranteed that "even if the task is not completed, wages will still be paid." As a result, the workers tentatively began to reform. The experiment resulted in the completion of the first segmented regular retreat mining face one and face two in the entire mining bureau, laying the foundation for eliminating accidents.

    Simultaneous with the improvement of the coal mining methods, the shaft not only implemented the production management regulations and labor conventions formulated by the mining bureau but also established various systems, implemented a safety responsibility system with dedicated personnel responsible for inspections. Whenever a potential accident hazard was discovered, the workers were immediately evacuated. Every half-month, the problems discovered during the inspection were discussed in seminars, and improvement measures were studied and implemented by the administration on schedule. In addition, to continuously raise the workers' awareness of safe production, in addition to calling on members to heighten their vigilance, the labor union implemented a reward and punishment system. It also used the time between collective work shifts to conduct safety work reports to workers going on and off duty. Each group also used rest time to hold group meetings to exchange views.

    Through such efforts, no deaths occurred in the first quarter of last year. The mine received a bonus from the mining bureau and commendation from the bureau director during the "May Day" holiday. The workers cherished this honor very much, and the honor was maintained until the end of the year. (Zhang Yue, Liang Zhenqiao, Kong Fancheng, Yu Tingji, Tang Gengsu, Du Zhulin)

　　东北鹤岗五矿五斜井
    改进采煤法一年无事故
    【本报讯】原来设备简陋、经常出事故的鹤岗矿务局第五矿第五斜井，由于加强了保安工作，一年来安全生产，没有发生伤亡事故。
    第五斜井是第五矿的主力井，有四、五百个工人，日产量最高时达一千二百吨。由于过去敌伪的掠夺抢采，只求产量高，不顾工人生命安全，矿中各掌子、巷道等工程设备都不合规格，加上采煤方法的特殊，因此经常发生事故，工人中严重存在“听天由命”的思想，认为“要采煤就得死人”。去年开展保安运动时，矿领导干部就研究出了安全生产的关键在于改进采煤法，但一开始是受到了工人保守思想的抗拒。因为敌伪遗留下来的掌子和采煤法虽然稍一不慎便有伤亡危险，但是比较省劲，能率高，工人们作惯了也就不愿改。后来经过矿上党、政、工、团努力宣传教育和发动，提出“宁愿少采几吨煤，不准伤亡一个人”的口号，并派了一批工人和干部到西安煤矿去学习正规回采，回来后仔细宣传介绍，才初步打通了不愿改的保守思想；矿行政上又保证了“即使完不成任务，也照发工资”。这样，工友们才用试验的方式进行改革。试验结果，是完成了全矿务局最先出现的分段正规回采一回二掌子，给消灭事故打下了基础。
    与改进采煤法同时，该井不仅贯彻了矿务局所制订的生产管理规程及劳动公约，并订立了各种制度，施行了安全负责制，有专人负责检查，凡发现有发生事故的可能性地方，马上撤出工作人员。每半月并将检查中所发现的问题座谈讨论，研究出改进办法后由行政掌握按期完成。另外，为不断提高工人对安全生产的觉悟，工会除了号召会员提高警惕外，并实行奖惩制度，又利用集体上下班之间的时间，向上下班工人进行保安工作报告，每个小组也利用休息时间开小组会交换意见。
    经过这样的努力，去年第一季度就没有发生死亡事件，“五一”节得到了矿务局的奖金和局长的嘉奖，工人们十分珍视这个荣誉，一直到年底，荣誉始终被保持了下来。（张钺、梁振乔、孔繁成、喻庭继、唐更苏、杜竹林）
