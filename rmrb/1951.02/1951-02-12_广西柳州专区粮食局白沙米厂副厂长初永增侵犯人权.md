　　Guangxi Liuzhou Special District Grain Bureau Baisha Rice Mill
　  Deputy Director Chu Yongzeng Violates Human Rights
    Editor:
    Administrative leading cadres in the Baisha Rice Mill of the Liuzhou Special District Grain Bureau in Guangxi exhibit serious bureaucratic and warlord styles. They unjustifiably dismissed workers Pu Jiahe and Jie Wenlu and illegally tied up veteran worker Li Yongheng, who had participated in the revolution for many years. The course of events is as follows: Since December of last year, the factory's production tasks have increased. Taking the carrying of grain sacks as an example: in the past, they carried 180 sacks per day, but now it has increased to 240 sacks. The wages are not very reasonable, and the food is even worse. Workers receive three and a half jin of rice per person per day, while administrative cadres receive two and a half jin. They eat together, managed by accountant Fan Renshan and Liang Ping. The workers often eat poorly, and the management personnel do not publicize the food accounts. At the end of last year, they suddenly claimed that the food expenses exceeded the budget by 1,000 jin of rice, which would be shared by everyone. In December of last year, Fan Renshan deducted 300 yuan from the workers' food allowance every day without their consent, claiming it was to buy bowls and pay for medical expenses for sick workers. Jie Wenlu, as the production committee member of the labor union, naturally stepped forward to speak for everyone, demanding that the accounts be made public. Pu Jiahe, because he refused to do personal errands for the deputy director and the accountant, aroused their dissatisfaction. Thus, on January 2nd, they suddenly used the excuse that "these two usually like to say strange things and have too many shortcomings" to forcibly dismiss them, forcing them to leave the factory immediately. Three days after the dismissal, they hired two temporary workers to replace their jobs. Veteran worker Li Yongheng, because he said this fair sentence: "The dismissed workers do not have major problems, the main problem is with the leadership of the factory." The next day (the 14th) at night, when everyone in the factory was asleep, Deputy Director Chu called Li Yongheng to his room to reprimand him. During a few conflicting sentences, Chu Yongzeng personally tied up Li Yongheng. Later, Comrade Li Zheng discovered this and ran to stop it, which ended the matter. The next day, Li Yongheng felt dizzy and unable to eat.
    Now, the Liuzhou General Labor Union and the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau are investigating and handling this matter. We hope to give this director, who arbitrarily violates human rights, a public criticism in the newspaper.

　　广西柳州专区粮食局白沙米厂
　  副厂长初永增侵犯人权
    编辑同志：
    广西柳州专区粮食局白沙米厂行政领导干部，存在着严重的官僚主义和军阀主义作风，无理解雇工人普家和、解文禄，非法捆绑参加革命多年的老工友李永恒。事情经过是这样：该厂自去年十二月份起，生产任务加重，拿抬谷包来说：过去每天抬一八○包，现在增加到二四○包。工资又不很合理，伙食搞的更坏，工人每天每人三斤半米，行政干部二斤半米，合在一块儿起伙，由会计樊仁山和梁平管理，工友们经常吃的很坏，管理人员不公布伙食账目，到去年年底，突然说是伙食多开支了一千斤米，要摊在大伙身上，去年十二月，樊仁山又不经过工人同意，每天扣工人菜金三百元，说是拿来买碗，作为病号的医药费。解文禄是工会的生产委员，当然是挺身出来替大家讲话，要求公布账目。普家和则因为不肯给副厂长和会计作私人事情，引起了他们的不满。于是便在一月二日突然借口“他们两个平时爱说怪话，缺点太多”，强行解雇，迫他们马上离厂。而在解雇后的第三天，便雇用两个临时工人来代替他们的工作。老工友李永恒，因为说了这样一句公正的话：“被解雇的工友没有大问题，主要是厂里的领导有问题。”第二天（十四日）夜里，当全厂的人都入睡的时候，李永恒便被初副厂长叫到他的房里去训斥他，语言间冲突了几句，初增永便亲自动手把李永恒绑起来。后来李政同志发觉跑来制止，才算完事。第二天李永恒就头昏眼花地吃不下饭。
    现在柳州总工会及市人民政府劳动局，正在调查处理这件事。我们希望在报上给这样随便侵犯人权的厂长一个公开批评。
