    Labor Model Liu Yuhou
    Writes About Production and Learning in His Hometown
    To the Editor:
    After returning from Beijing last October, I went to Chang'an County to participate in land reform work. Recently, I received a letter from my hometown, Haojiaqiao Village in Suide, saying that the village's production is doing very well. Last year, the village's yield of fine grains per mu increased by nine sheng and six he compared to the year before. This is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership, so the entire village is very grateful to Chairman Mao. The village wrote a letter to Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Xi Zhongxun wrote a reply to the village. After reading this reply to everyone, the entire village's production enthusiasm has become even higher. My family planted a total of twenty-five qing of land this year, and now the family is busy collecting manure and chopping firewood. The village's winter school and newspaper reading groups are also going very well. There are now forty newspaper reading groups in the village, and young people are learning to read and often listening to newspaper readings. Everyone is confident in maintaining our village's glorious labor tradition.
    Editor, you must be very happy to hear about these situations!
                                          Liu Yuhou

    劳动模范刘玉厚
    来信谈家乡生产和学习编辑同志：
    去年十月从北京回来以后，又到长安县参加土改工作。最近接到家乡绥德郝家桥来信说，全村生产搞得很好，去年全村每亩地比前年多收了细粮九升六合。这是毛主席英明领导的结果，所以全村人民都很感谢毛主席。村里曾给中共中央西北局书记习仲勋同志写了一封信，习仲勋书记又给村里回了一封信。这封回信念给大家听后，全村生产情绪更加高涨起来。我家中今年共种了二十五垧地，现在家中正忙着拾粪，砍柴。全村冬学和读报组也搞得很起劲。现在全村有四十个读报组，青年人都在认字并经常听读报。大家都有信心要保持我们那村的光荣的劳动传统。
    编辑同志，你听了这些情况一定很高兴吧！
                                          刘玉厚
