To the Editor:

The state-owned Xinji Coal Mine in Jiyuan County faces the following problems, which urgently need to be addressed:

    (1) The mine leadership does not study or inspect coal mining engineering and specifications, nor does it clearly instruct workers on the direction of coal mining. As a result, workers dig wherever they see coal after going down the mine, causing the best No. 4 kiln to collapse, resulting in a loss of assets equivalent to 90,000 catties of grain.

    (2) Zhang Jintai, the head of the storage section of the mine, instructs his staff to defraud workers. When receiving grain, the weight on the scale is pulled inward; when dispensing grain, the rope on the scale is pushed outward. According to recent information, this has resulted in the deduction of more than 8,000 catties of grain from public funds and workers' wages.

    (3) The mine does not allocate funds to the trade union as stipulated by the Trade Union Law. The head of the Industry and Commerce Section of the county even believes that "this is a good thing."

    (4) The working hours are too long. Young workers work up to twelve hours a day, and well-repairing and well-digging workers sometimes work up to eighteen hours. Although some improvements have been made after the trade union raised the issue, the problem has not been completely resolved, seriously affecting the workers' health. At the same time, the workers' wage levels for this year have not yet been determined, and the workers' enthusiasm for production is not high.

    (5) Feudal foremen still occupy a dominant position. The only change is that the old title of "Lao Zong" (old boss) has been changed to "Technician," but in reality, they still oppress workers and hinder the progress of work. For example, Chang Xishun, a foreman, spread rumors after returning from a training class organized by the trade union office, saying that the living conditions in the training class were unreasonable and hindering workers from attending.

Editor's Note: The Jiyuan County People's Government and the leadership of the Xinji Coal Mine should immediately and conscientiously investigate the issues raised in Comrade Li Zaiyang's letter and resolve them reasonably.

### 平原省济源县新济煤矿亟应改进

    平原省济源县新济煤矿亟应改进编辑同志：
    济源县公营新济煤矿，存在着下面几个问题，亟待解决：
    （一）矿山领导上对采煤工程、规格，不研究，不检查，也不明确指示工人采煤的方向；以致工人下井后，见煤就刨，使最好的四号窑桶塌落，损失资财折合粮食九万斤。
    （二）该矿保管股长张金太指使股员欺诈工人，在收粮食时，秤锤从外往里拉；出粮食时，由秤的毫绳往外推。据最近知道的，这样克扣了公家和工人工资米八千余斤。
    （三）矿上不按工会法规定拨交工会经费，该县工商科长还以为“这样很好。”
    （四）工作时间过长，青工每天工作时间达十二小时，修井、打井工人还有作到十八小时的。经工会提出后，改善了一些，但仍未彻底解决，严重影响了工人身体健康。同时今年工人的工资额至今还未确定，工人的生产情绪不高。
    （五）封建把头仍占着统治地位，仅仅是把过去“老总”的称呼改为“技术员”，实际上还压迫工人，阻碍工作开展。如把头常喜顺从工会办事处办的训练班学习回来后，散布谣言，说训练班的生活不合理，并阻碍工人前往学习。
                                 平原省总工会筹委会  李再扬
    编者按：对李再扬同志来信所提问题，济源县人民政府及新济煤矿领导上应立即认真检查，予以合理解决。
