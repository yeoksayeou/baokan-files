Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 22nd: TASS, Berlin: The first meeting of the World Peace Council opened in Berlin on the morning of the 21st. The opening meeting was presided over by Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. The presidium consisted of Executive Bureau Vice-Chairmen Fadeyev, Guo Moruo, D'Arboussier, and Executive Bureau members Ehrenburg, Xiao San, Farge, and Lafargue.

In his opening remarks, Nenni first welcomed all members of the Council and those invited to attend, and expressed regret that the Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie, was unable to attend and preside over the opening because the Bonn "government," at the behest of its American masters, refused to issue him a transit visa. On behalf of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and all members of the Council, Nenni expressed his gratitude to the government of the German Democratic Republic, the Mayor of Berlin, and the German Peace Committee for allowing the Council to hold its meeting in Berlin.

Nenni spoke about the importance of the issues the Council will study, especially the issues of Germany and Japan, and emphasized that the work of the meeting must help the people of all countries unite to prevent new wars, to fight against the provocations of militarist elements, and to defend life and peace.

Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Committee and President of Humboldt University in Berlin, spoke, thanking the World Peace Council for holding its meeting in Berlin. Friedrich said: As a representative of the scientific community, my important task is to educate German youth in the spirit of fighting for peace. But just 300 meters from the meeting place of the Council, in West Berlin, tens of thousands of people are being summoned to report to conscription stations. German youth are firmly opposed to German rearmament. Friedrich pointed out that in the German Democratic Republic, all the necessary conditions for the peaceful development of the country are in place. He expressed his belief that the first meeting of the World Peace Council will give new impetus to the peace movement and will adopt resolutions that are eagerly awaited by peace-loving people.

Dr. Schwarz, the Mayor of Berlin, read a congratulatory telegram from the democratic municipal government of Greater Berlin, which stated: The World Peace Council's decision to hold its meeting in the capital of Germany proves that resolving the German issue peacefully in 1951 has not only become the cause of the German people, but also the cause of all people in the world.

At the end of the meeting, the Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, Lafargue, reported on the agenda of the meeting. Lafargue proposed the Executive Bureau's suggestion to establish four committees: the Political Committee, the Organizational Committee, the "Peace" magazine Committee, and the International Peace Prize Committee. The Political Committee will draft decisions on important issues such as the peaceful resolution of the German issue and the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue related to the Korean issue. Lafargue stated: In view of the many suggestions received by the Secretariat and the Executive Bureau, the meeting will discuss the issue of the peaceful struggle in colonial countries, which will also be discussed by the Political Committee. The Organizational Committee will handle the implementation of the tasks stipulated by the Warsaw Congress and the Geneva meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, especially the preparation for holding meetings on economic and cultural issues, which will help establish normal economic and cultural relations between countries around the world. The Organizational Committee will also consider the issue of legislative measures by countries to prohibit war propaganda and the issue of expanding the peace movement. The "Peace" magazine Committee will formulate issues to expand and improve the work of the "Peace" magazine. The International Peace Prize Committee will formulate recommendations on the establishment of an international review panel and will stipulate the procedures for awarding the International Peace Prize in 1951.

At the afternoon meeting on the 21st, Nenni delivered a report on the implementation of the program of the Second World Peace Congress. Those who spoke in the discussion included: the Deputy Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson (England), D'Arboussier (Africa), Dimbowski (Poland), Bouchama (Algeria), and Becher (Germany). The meeting was then adjourned. The meeting continued on the 22nd to discuss Nenni's report.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression sent a congratulatory telegram to the meeting of the World Peace Council. The telegram reads as follows: Chairman Joliot-Curie of the Berlin World Peace Council Meeting:

The meeting of the World Peace Council, convened at this critical moment in the struggle between the forces of peace and war, will have a great impact on mobilizing the people of the world to actively safeguard peace, oppose the United States' insistence on aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and stop the United States from rearming West Germany and Japan. On behalf of the Chinese people, who stand on the front line of defending peace, I extend warm congratulations to the meeting.

    南尼在致开幕辞时，首先欢迎理事会全体理事和被邀请列席的人士，并对于世界和平理事会执行局主席约里奥——居里因波恩“政府”奉其美国主子之命拒绝发给过境签证而未能到会主持开幕表示遗憾。南尼代表世界和平理事会执行局和理事会全体理事为理事会得以在柏林举行而向德意志民主共和国政府、柏林市长及德国和平委员会表示谢意。
    南尼讲述了理事会所将研究的各项问题、特别是德国和日本问题的重要性，并着重指出会议的工作必须帮助各国人民团结起来防止新战争，为反对军国主义分子的挑衅、为保卫生活与和平而斗争。
    德国和平委员会主席、柏林胡包特大学校长腓特烈教授发言，感谢世界和平理事会在柏林举行会议。腓特烈说：我是科学界代表，我的重大任务就是用为争取和平而斗争的精神教育德国青年。但就在距理事会会场三百米的地方，在柏林西部，就有成千成万的人被传到征兵站去报到。德国青年对德国重新武装表示坚决反对。腓特烈指出，在德意志民主共和国里，国家和平发展的一切必要条件都已具备。他表示相信世界和平理事会的第一届会议将使和平运动得到新的推动力，并将通过为爱好和平的人民所热烈期待着的决议。
    柏林市长施瓦兹博士宣读了大柏林市民主市政府的贺电称：世界和平理事会选择在德国首都举行会议，证明在一九五一年以和平方式解决德国问题不仅已经成为德国人民的事业，而且也成为世界一切人民的事业。
    在会议结束时，世界和平理事会秘书长拉斐德报告了会议的议程。拉斐德提出执行局关于成立四个委员会的建议，这四个委员会是：政治委员会、组织委员会、《和平》杂志委员会以及国际和平奖金委员会。政治委员会将起草关于以和平方式解决德国问题、以和平方式解决与朝鲜问题有关的日本问题等重要问题的决定。拉斐德称：鉴于秘书处和执行局接到许多建议，会议将讨论殖民地国家内的和平斗争问题，这个问题也将由政治委员会讨论。组织委员会将处理华沙大会和世界和平理事会执行局日内瓦会议所规定的任务的执行问题，特别是关于筹备举行关于经济与文化问题的会议，这种会议将有助于建立世界各国间正常的经济与文化关系。组织委员会还将考虑各国通过禁止战争宣传的立法措施问题和扩大和平运动的问题。《和平》杂志委员会将拟订扩大并改进《和平》杂志的工作的问题。国际和平奖金委员会将拟订关于设立国际审查团的建议，并将规定在一九五一年颁发国际和平奖金的程序。
