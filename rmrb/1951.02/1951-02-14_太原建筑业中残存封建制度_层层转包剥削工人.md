　　Taiyuan's Construction Industry Retains Feudal System
　　Layered Subcontracting Exploits Workers
    In Taiyuan's construction industry, due to the remnants of layered subcontracting of projects and the feudal foreman system, workers suffer all kinds of cruel exploitation, and national construction and people's property suffer great losses. Therefore, as many as 300 disputes occurred last year.
    Most construction companies in this city have an extremely strong profit-only viewpoint, and consider the task completed as soon as the project is subcontracted. Some administrative cadres in charge have insufficient understanding of the feudal exploitation of the foremen and its hindrance to production, and rely on the foremen instead of relying on the masses of workers. After the construction company contracts the project, instead of recruiting workers, preparing materials, managing, and operating, it extracts an illegal profit and subcontracts the whole project to others. For example, the Xinzhong Civil Engineering Construction Company contracted a 2,000-cubic-meter gravel project from the Water Conservancy Bureau, with a labor price of 150 jin of millet per cubic meter. The company then subcontracted it to foreman Li Yimin at 135 jin and 12 liang per cubic meter, and Li then subcontracted it to small foreman Liu Ziming at 122 jin and 3 liang per cubic meter. Dahua Construction Company contracted the river diversion project of the Water Conservancy Bureau in Qingyuan County at a price of 5 jin of millet per cubic meter of earth. After four layers of subcontracting, the workers received only 2 jin and 12 liang per cubic meter of earth. Such facts are too numerous to mention.
    Although the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Contracting and Subcontracting of Public and Private Construction Projects and the Handling of Labor Disputes in Taiyuan City" in June last year, strictly prohibiting subcontracting, public and private manufacturers still secretly carry out subcontracting projects as before. Some state-owned companies subcontract projects to private manufacturers and temporarily add the name "Engineering Team"; foremen also change the subcontracting method, with several foremen jointly contracting projects, claiming to be labor cooperative teams of labor unions, but in fact they are still feudal exploitation in disguise.
    Due to layered subcontracting, no one is responsible for the project, resulting in shoddy workmanship and inferior materials, and national construction suffers losses. According to the demands of the broad masses of workers, the Construction Trade Union organized and led the workers to resolutely fight against feudal foremen and illegal manufacturers. With the support of the government, the most heinous foremen Zhang Liansheng, Tang Yonggui, and Li Zhensheng have been sent to the court for punishment, and illegal speculative manufacturers such as Huaxing, Huaxin, Xinjin, Limin, Zicheng Rong, and Tongcheng have been banned by the government.
    In order to completely abolish the feudal exploitation system in the construction industry, the Municipal Construction Trade Union began to hold training courses for grassroots cadres in January to strengthen the grassroots organizational forces; the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government also convened a meeting of responsible persons from public and private manufacturers and re-elected the trade association. Currently, workers from state-owned Taiyuan and Xinsheng Construction Companies and private construction companies and manufacturers such as Daye and Huatai are planning to fix a group of long-term workers this year, establish direct business relationships with workers, implement piece-rate wages, and abolish intermediate exploitation to establish a new system.

### 太原建筑业中残存封建制度  层层转包剥削工人

　　太原建筑业中残存封建制度
　  层层转包剥削工人
    太原市建筑业中由于残留着层层转包工程和封建把头制度，工人遭受到种种的残酷剥削，国家建设和人民财产也受到很大的损失。因此，去年一年内发生争议达三百件之多。
    本市大部建筑公司单纯营利观点极为浓厚，只要工程转包出去，任务就算完成。部分行政负责干部对于包工头的封建剥削及其对生产的阻碍认识不足，不是依靠工人群众而是依靠工头。建筑公司包揽到工程后，不是招工备料，管理经营；而是抽取一部非法利润后，原盘转包他人。如新中土木建筑公司由水利局包到两千方石子工程，每方工价一百五十斤小米，该公司又以每方一百三十五斤十二两包给了工头李宜敏，李又以每方一百二十二斤三两包给小工头刘子明。大华建筑公司以每方土五斤小米包到水利局在清源县的引河工程，经过四次转包后，到工人手里每方土就成了二斤十二两。此类事实不胜枚举。
    太原市人民政府虽于去年六月间颁布了“太原市公私建筑工程放工包工管理及劳动争议处理暂行办法”，严禁转包行为。但各公私厂商仍照旧暗中进行转包工程。有的公营公司把工程转包给私营厂商，就临时给加上“工程队”的名义；包工头也多改变了包工方法，几个工头合股包工，声称是劳动组合的劳合班，其实仍旧是换汤不换药的封建剥削行为。
    由于层层转包，致使工程无人负责，偷工减料，粗制滥造，国家建设受到损失。建筑工会根据广大工人要求，组织和领导工人坚决的向封建把头及非法厂商作斗争，在政府的支持下，罪恶较大的把头张连生、唐永贵、李振生已送法院惩办，违法投机厂商，华兴、华新、新晋、利民、自成荣、同成等已被政府取缔。
    为彻底废除建筑工业中的封建剥削制，市建筑工会一月份开始举办了基层干部轮训班，以加强基层组织力量；太原市人民政府也召集了公私厂商负责人会议，并改选了同业公会。现公营太原、新生建筑公司工人及私营大业、华泰等建筑公司及厂商，均计划今年固定一部长期工人，与工人发生直接的经营关系，实行计件工资等办法，废除中间剥削，建立新制度。
