Xinhua News Agency, February 27th dispatch: TASS Berlin dispatch: The First Session of the World Peace Council concluded victoriously on the 26th, after a full day of meetings and the passage of eight important resolutions.

　　At the morning session, World Peace Council member and famous Soviet writer Korneichuk delivered a speech stating that the declaration on concluding a peace pact among the five major powers adopted by the World Peace Council has major historical significance. The current situation requires peace advocates to take decisive action and exert pressure on governments and parliaments of all countries to make them, along with millions of people, demand that the governments of the five major powers hold a meeting this year.

　　American representative Dahl stated in his speech that the movement to collect signatures for peace in the United States has promoted the American people's understanding of their responsibility to the peaceful people of all countries. After returning home from the Warsaw Conference, the American representatives delivered speeches at hundreds of gatherings, reading "A Letter to the United Nations" to millions of people. Currently, the American people's movement against the government's diplomatic policy is growing stronger, and millions of people have begun to express concern about the danger of war and declare that they will fight for peace.

　　The representative of Burma, Ko Htun Zan, angrily denounced the British and American warmongers' attempt to turn Burma into their war base. He emphasized and declared that the peace fighters of Burma are fully determined to prevent Burma from becoming a springboard for aggression against great China. The Asian people, who have suffered from the scourge of Japanese aggressors, resolutely oppose the re-militarization of Japan.

　　World Peace Council member and National Committee member of the Chinese YMCA, Wu Yaozong, stated in his speech that nearly 100,000 Christians in China have now signed the declaration "The Path of Chinese Christianity's Efforts in the Construction of New China." They unanimously hailed the Chinese People's Revolution and are now actively participating in the struggle to defend world peace.

　　Iranian representative, lawyer Eskandari, pointed out in his speech that the democratic forces in the Middle Eastern countries are developing day by day. The decision to recently convene a meeting of peace fighters in the Middle East will greatly help strengthen the struggle to defend peace in this region. Eskandari suggested that the Secretariat of the World Peace Council set up a special agency in the Middle East to promote the peace movement.

　　At the afternoon session, Council member Deschamps (France), on behalf of the current session, read out the resolution on organizational issues to the Organizing Committee. Council member Atal (India) read out the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Executive Bureau Secretary Xiao San (China), on behalf of the Political Committee, read out the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Japanese issue. Council member Dahl (USA) read out the resolution on the United Nations' unjust decision to condemn the People's Republic of China as the "aggressor" in Korea. Executive Bureau Vice-Chairman Dabose (Africa) read out the resolution on the struggle for peace in colonies and dependent countries. Council member Blier (France) read out the resolution on the magazine *Peace*. Executive Bureau Secretary Posari (Brazil) read out the resolution on the International Peace Prize. Council member Vignon (France) read out the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the German issue. All motions were unanimously adopted by all the representatives.

　　Secretary-General of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, Laft, delivered the closing address. He emphasized the importance of the historical documents adopted by the current session of the World Peace Council, stating that these documents have become the basis for the activities of peace fighters around the world. He called on peace fighters around the world to immediately begin implementing the resolution on intensifying the struggle against war, and wished them success in completing these great tasks.

　　The First Session of the World Peace Council hereby declared its victorious conclusion.

　　[This Newspaper] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th: The World Peace Council, at its meeting on the 25th, unanimously passed the World Peace Council's Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact and the Resolution on the United Nations amidst a surge of enthusiasm.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 27th dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin, the World Peace Council continued its meeting on the 25th. The meeting was chaired by Professor Bernal, a British scientist and Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the Council. Executive Bureau Vice-Chairman Nenni declared at the meeting: "The Political Committee of this session has drafted and unanimously adopted several resolutions, which are now submitted to the meeting for review. We will now read the World Peace Council's Declaration on Concluding a Peace Pact and the Resolution on the United Nations, and then conduct discussions and votes." Nenni then read the full text of the declaration in French. It was simultaneously read in Russian, Chinese, English, and German. In pointing out the significance of the declaration, Nenni emphasized: "The main task of peace advocates today is to fight for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. This struggle cannot be completed in a week or a month, and may last for many months. However, if this declaration receives attention, it will help save the world from the danger of a new war and unite all people who do not want war around it."

　　Bernal emphasized in his speech: "This declaration of the World Peace Council puts forward the demand of the people of the world for the major powers to reach an agreement and conclude a peace pact. It will gain the support of a broader section of the people than the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The governments of three of the five major powers even refuse to listen to any questions raised by peace advocates. Therefore, peace fighters in these countries must win over the broad masses of people from all walks of life and demand that their governments hold negotiations among the five major powers. A mass movement larger than the signature collection campaign for the Stockholm Peace Appeal must be organized to collect signatures for this declaration."

　　Secretary-General of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, Laft, declared: "Although the Chairman of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie, cannot directly participate in the work of the meeting, he maintains close contact with the meeting. He fully agrees with the content and form of the declaration, and therefore requests to reserve his right to be the first to sign the declaration." After Laft's announcement, enthusiastic applause immediately resounded in the hall.

    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会第一届会议在二十六日进行整日的会议，通过八项重要决议后，已宣告胜利闭幕。
    在上午的会议上，世界和平理事会理事、苏联名作家考涅楚克发表演说称：世界和平理事会通过的关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言具有重大的历史性意义。目前的局势要求和平拥护者采取决定性的行动，对各国政府和议会施以压力，使它们和千百万人民一道要求五大国政府在本年内举行会议。
    美国代表达尔发言称：美国征集和平签名的运动，已促进美国人民认清了他们对各国和平人民的责任。参加华沙大会的美国代表返国后，曾在数百个集会上发表演说，向数百万人民宣读了“致联合国书”。目前美国人民反对政府外交政策的运动日益发展壮大，千百万人民已开始对战争的危险表示忧虑，并声言为和平而斗争。
    缅甸代表哥腾善怒愤地斥责了英美战争贩子企图将缅甸变成它们的战争基地。他强调宣称缅甸的和平战士有充分决心制止把缅甸变成侵略伟大中国的跳板。遭受过日本侵略者荼毒的亚洲人民坚决反对日本重新军国主义化。
    世界和平理事会理事、中华基督教青年会全国协会委员吴耀宗发表演说称：中国现在已有将近十万基督教徒在“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”的宣言上签了名，他们一致欢呼中国人民革命，现在正积极参加保卫全世界和平的斗争。
    伊朗代表艾斯堪德里律师发言指出：中东各国的民主力量日益发展。关于最近召开中东和平战士会议的决定对于加强这一地区的保卫和平的斗争将有很大帮助。艾斯堪德里建议世界和平理事会秘书处在中东设立一个特别机构，以推动和平运动。
    在下午会议上，理事会理事德香布兰（法）代表本届会议向组织委员会宣读了关于组织问题的决议案，理事阿塔尔（印度）宣读了关于和平解决朝鲜问题的决议案，理事会执行局秘书萧三（中）代表政治委员会宣读了关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议案，理事会理事达尔（美）宣读了关于联合国谴责中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的不公正的决定之决议案，执行局副主席达波赛（非洲）宣读了关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议案，理事布利埃（法）宣读了关于《和平》杂志的决议案，执行局秘书波萨里（巴西）宣读了关于国际和平奖金的决议案，理事维尼耶（法）宣读了以和平方式解决德国问题的决议案。各项议案均分别经全体代表一致通过。
    世界和平理事会执行局秘书长拉斐德致闭幕词。他强调指出世界和平理事会本届会议所通过的各项历史文件的重要性称：这些文件已成为全世界各地和平战士的活动的基础。他号召全世界和平战士们立即开始执行关于加紧反对战争的斗争的决议，并祝他们胜利完成这些伟大的任务。
    世界和平理事会第一届会议至此宣告胜利闭幕。
    【本报讯】据新华社柏林二十七日电：世界和平理事会二十五日会议在高涨的热情中一致通过了世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言和关于联合国的决议。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会于二十五日继续开会，会议由理事会执行局副主席、英国科学家贝尔纳教授主持。执行局副主席南尼在会上宣称：“本届会议的政治委员会已草拟并一致通过了若干决议案，现在分别提交会议审议。现在要宣读世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言和关于联合国的决议，然后进行讨论和表决。”南尼继用法语宣读了宣言的全文，会上同时用俄、华、英、德语予以宣读。南尼在指出宣言的意义时强调称：“当前和平拥护者的主要任务就是为争取缔结五大国和平公约而斗争。这个斗争不是一星期或一个月就能完成的，很可能要持续许多个月。但是，如果这个宣言受到注意，它将有助于把世界从新战争的危险中拯救出来，并把所有不希望战争的人们团结在它的周围。”
    贝尔纳在发言中强调称：“世界和平理事会的这个宣言提出了全世界人民要大国获致协议和缔结和平公约的要求，它将比斯德哥尔摩和平宣言获得更为广大的人民的拥护。五大国中有三个国家的政府甚至拒绝听取和平拥护者所提出的一切问题。因此，这些国家的和平斗士必须把广大的各阶层人民争取过来，要求他们的政府举行五大国谈判。必须组织一个比斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集签名运动还要广大的群众运动来征集这个宣言的签名。”
    世界和平理事会执行局秘书长拉斐德宣称：“世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里虽然不能直接参加会议的工作，但仍与会议保持密切的联系。他完全赞同宣言的内容和形式，因此要求保留他第一个在宣言上签名的权利。”拉斐德宣布后会场上立即响起了热烈的掌声。
