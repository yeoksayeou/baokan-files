　　Soldiers' Laughter
　  ——New China News Agency Han River Frontline Reporter
    The lies broadcast by Tokyo Radio these past two days have become a topic of mockery among the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces at the Han River front. On February 10th, Tokyo Radio lied, saying that Syngman Rhee's forward troops had entered Seoul on the 10th and that shooting battles had occurred within the city. How did the soldiers in the bunkers at the Han River bridgehead react to this ridiculous, massive lie? The soldiers said, "The Americans only looked at Seoul a few times with their binoculars from the other side of the Han River, and they call that entering Seoul."
    It is already spring in Korea, but the thawing of the Han River is later than in previous years, which seems to be a great "help" to the American invading forces who want to come to Seoul. At 10:00 AM on February 11th—twenty-four hours after Tokyo Radio's "entry into Seoul"—there were indeed more than a hundred guys who tried to sneak across the frozen river surface near the Han River Iron Bridge to the north bank. Our soldiers guarding the bridgehead were truly happy, waiting silently. When those fools reached the center of the river surface, all kinds of firearms suddenly opened fire on them. Those guys were shot and lay scattered all over the river surface, some falling into the ice holes, never to come out again. One soldier, looking at the corpses of those beasts lying on the Han River, mocked, "I heard the American soldiers came to Korea to eat Pyongyang's good apples; now let them drink some of the Han River's ice water."
    These brave warriors, who know no fear and fatigue, advanced bravely southward from the mountains of northern Korea, successively crossing the Chongchon River, the Taedong River, and the Imjin River, and arrived at the Han River front. Now, they have been fighting fiercely against the American invading forces for eighteen days and nights. Despite the enemy's aircraft and artillery's frantic bombardment, these fearless soldiers, whenever they have a moment's break during the fierce battle, laugh and talk loudly in the trenches and bunkers. From Suwon to the south bank of the Han River is only twenty-eight kilometers, but the American soldiers advance on average less than two kilometers each day. This is an excellent irony for the American invading forces who like to boast about their "mechanization" and "strong firepower." One soldier mocked, "People say Walker was an incompetent general. I think Ridgway is just as incompetent as Walker, half a catty to eight taels. I never thought that so many incompetent generals still dream of 'conquering the world'!"

### 战士们的嘲笑——新华社汉江前线记者

　　战士们的嘲笑
　  ——新华社汉江前线记者
    这两天东京广播电台撒的谎话，成了汉江前线英勇的中朝人民部队战士们嘲笑的话题。东京广播电台在二月十日撒谎说：李承晚的前哨部队已在十日进入汉城，并在城内发生射击战。在汉江桥头阵地掩蔽部里的战士们，对于这一个可笑的大谎话，是怎样谈论的呢？战士们说：“美国人只是在汉江那边用望远镜望了几眼，这就叫进了汉城了。”
    现在朝鲜已经是春天了，但汉江的解冻比往年来得晚，这对于想到汉城来的美国侵略军似乎是一个很大的“帮忙”。在二月十一日上午十时，——就是东京广播“进入汉城”以后的二十四小时，倒确实是有一百多个家伙想从汉江铁桥附近结冰的江面上偷偷地跑到北岸来。守在桥头堡上的我们的战士们真高兴，一声不响地等着，当那些蠢猪们得意地走到江面中心时，各种火器就突然向他们一齐发射起来。那些家伙被打得横七竖八地躺倒在江面上，有的掉到冰窟窿里去，再也出不来了。一位战士望着那些躺在汉江上的野兽们的尸体，嘲笑着说：“听说美国兵是为了吃平壤的好苹果来到朝鲜的，现在让他们喝点汉江的冰水罢。”
    这些不知道畏惧和疲乏的勇士们，从朝鲜北部的山地，奋勇直前地向南挺进，接连跨越过清川江、大同江、临津江，来到了汉江前线。现在，他们又已经对美国侵略军奋战了十八个昼夜了。尽管敌人的飞机和大炮疯狂轰击，但这些无畏的战士们，只要在激烈的战斗中有一刻空隙，就在战壕里、掩蔽部里大声地谈笑起来。从水原到汉江南岸不过二十八公里，可是美国兵每天前进却平均不到两公里。这对于好自吹嘘“机械化”和“火力强”的美国侵略军，正是绝好的讽刺。一位战士嘲笑说：“人们说瓦克是个草包将军，我看李奇微和瓦克比起来，恰好是半斤对八两。想不到这么些草包将军，还梦想‘征服世界’呢！”
