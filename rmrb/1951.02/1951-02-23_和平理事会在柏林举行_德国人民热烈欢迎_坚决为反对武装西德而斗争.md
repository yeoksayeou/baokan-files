    Determined to Fight Against the Arming of West Germany
    【Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd】The German people warmly welcome the World Peace Council's meeting in Berlin. On the 22nd, all democratic newspapers in Berlin published editorials commenting on the World Peace Council meeting and printed photos of the council members. On the morning of the 21st, a large number of working people in Berlin gathered at the News Building on Friedrichstrasse, the meeting site of the council, to welcome peace fighters from all over the world.
    For a week, the newspapers of the German Democratic Republic have devoted considerable space to reporting on the World Peace Council. The arrival of the Soviet and Chinese delegations attracted great attention. Berlin was filled with a festive atmosphere. At airports, train stations, and on the streets, national flags and huge portraits of members of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council fluttered everywhere. The streets and squares were plastered with slogans depicting white peace doves, reading: "Welcome to the peace delegations from all countries," "Salute to the people of all countries fighting for peace," "Together with the Peace Council, fight to defend peace and against the arming of West Germany." These slogans powerfully expressed the firm will of the seventy million German people to defend peace.

    【新华社柏林二十二日电】德国人民热烈欢迎世界和平理事会在柏林举行会议。二十二日柏林各民主报纸都发表了评论世界和平理事会会议的社论，并刊登了理事们的照片。二十一日清晨，众多柏林的劳动人民聚集在理事会会址的佛莱德里赫街的新闻大厦，欢迎来自世界各地的和平斗士。
    一周来德意志民主共和国各报都以很大篇幅报道了有关世界和平理事会的消息，苏联和中国代表团的到达曾引起了极大的注意。柏林充满了一片节日的欢欣，在飞机场、火车站和街道上，到处飘扬着各国国旗和世界和平理事会执行局委员的巨幅画像。街上和广场上贴遍了绘有白色和平鸽的标语，写着：“欢迎各国和平代表团”、“向为和平而斗争的各国人民致敬”、“与和平理事会一道为保卫和平与反对武装西德而斗争”。这些标语有力地表达了七千万德国人民保卫和平的坚决意志。
