　　Pucheng People's Bank Issues Loans for Draught Animals
　　Due to a lack of animal power in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, farmers are unable to cultivate their land effectively. Based on the instructions of the Provincial People's Government and the higher-level banks, the county's People's Bank branch has been organizing the issuance of loans for draught animals since January of this year. To date, RMB 79.72 million has been loaned out in eleven administrative villages in four districts, benefiting 136 farming households. This has also stimulated private investment of over RMB 9.14 million, enabling the purchase of over 100 head of livestock in total. The loan program is ongoing.
　　The county is about to complete land reform, and many poor peasants and farm laborers have received land and bought livestock, resulting in high enthusiasm for production. Farmer Liu Jilin said, "We poor people have received land, and the People's Government has also given us loans to buy livestock. This spirit of caring for the difficulties of the people truly moves me. I will definitely work hard in production and live up to the expectations of the government."

　　蒲城人民银行发放耕畜贷款
    陕西省蒲城县因畜力缺乏，致使农民不能很好耕作。该县人民银行支行根据省人民政府和上级行的指示，于今年一月有组织地发放耕畜贷款。现已在四个区的十一个行政村中贷出人民币七千九百七十二万元。得到贷款的农民有一百三十六户。同时还带动私资九百一十四万多元，共可购买牲畜百余头。贷款在继续发放。
    该县即将完成土地改革，不少贫农、雇农分得了土地，又买了牲口，生产情绪很高。农民刘吉林说：“咱们穷人分到了土地，人民政府又贷给咱款买牲口，这种体贴人民困难的精神真使我感动。我一定好好生产，不辜负政府的心意。”
