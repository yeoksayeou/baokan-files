　　Carrying out Rural Credit Work

Editor's note: Rural credit work is a good way to organize rural idle funds and solve the difficulties of farmers in production and life. At the same time, it plays a significant role in developing cooperative undertakings, enlivening rural finance, and promoting material exchange. The credit business of cooperatives in various places is currently still in the exploratory and trial stage. The process of the Baijiazhuang Cooperative in Wu'xiang and the Xibaicheng Village Cooperative in Qingyuan carrying out credit work provides preliminary experience on how cooperatives can adapt to the urgent needs of farmers in rural areas and run credit businesses. The common feature of the two cooperatives is strict adherence to credit. Only by strictly adhering to credit can we use facts to dispel the ideological concerns of farmers, and the credit business will develop accordingly.

　　开展农村信贷工作
　　编者按：农村信贷工作，是组织农村游资，解决农民生产和生活中困难的良好办法，同时对发展合作事业，活泼农村金融，以及促进物资交流有着很大作用。各地合作社的信贷业务，目前尚在摸索试办时期，武乡白家庄合作社和清苑西白城村合作社开展信贷工作的过程，提供了合作社在农村中如何适应农民迫切要求，举办信用业务的初步经验。两社的共同特点是严守信用。只有严守信用，才能用事实解除农民的思想顾虑，而信贷业务也就随之发展起来。
