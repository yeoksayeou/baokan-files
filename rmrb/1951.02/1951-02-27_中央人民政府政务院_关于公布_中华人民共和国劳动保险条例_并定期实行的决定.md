The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government

Decision on Promulgating the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" and Implementing Them on Schedule

(Passed at the 73rd Government Administration Council Meeting on February 23, 1951)

In accordance with Article 32 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates "gradually implement the labor insurance system," this Council formulated the "Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" and publicly announced it on October 29, 1950, to solicit opinions from the people of the whole country. Over the past three months, a total of 141 written opinions have been received from trade union organizations, industrial and commercial circles, government agencies, and individuals from all over the country. The regulations have now been revised accordingly. However, since these regulations are still of a key pilot nature, it has been decided that they will still be promulgated and implemented by this Council. In order to implement these regulations, the following decisions are made:

	1. The Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China shall take effect from March 1, 1951. That is, the administrative side or the capitalists of the enterprises shall pay the labor insurance premium starting from March; workers and staff shall receive the labor insurance benefits they are entitled to under these regulations starting from May 1.

	2. All enterprises that should implement labor insurance according to the provisions of these regulations shall, from the date of promulgation of this decision, have their administrative side or capitalists, together with the grassroots trade union committees of each enterprise, apply to the local people's government labor administration organs for registration to implement labor insurance. Those that are difficult to maintain due to special economic difficulties or have not yet officially started operations, and have agreed with the grassroots trade union organization to postpone implementation through consultation between the administrative side or capitalists and the grassroots trade union organization, shall apply to the local people's government labor administration organs for approval and record; if the two parties fail to reach a consensus on whether to implement it, they shall submit it to the local people's government labor administration organs for handling. All of the above procedures shall be completed before March 15, 1951.

	3. The People's Bank of China is designated as the general treasury for collecting and managing labor insurance funds. The detailed measures shall be formulated by the bank in consultation with the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and all branches and sub-branches across the country must be notified to make all preparations before March 10.

	4. The administrative side or capitalists of the enterprises implementing labor insurance shall, in cooperation with the grassroots trade union committees, make all preparations for the implementation of labor insurance in their respective enterprises before the end of April.

	5. The Ministry of Labor of the Central Government shall, in cooperation with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, which shall be promulgated by the Ministry of Labor in early March of this year.

　　中央人民政府政务院
  　关于公布“中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”并定期实行的决定
    （一九五一年二月二十三日政务院第七十三次政务会议通过）
    本院根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三十二条“逐步实行劳动保险制度”的规定，制定“中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案”，于一九五零年十月二十九日公开发表，征求全国人民的意见。三个月以来，共收到全国各地工会组织、工商业界、政府机关及个人寄来的意见书一百四十一件，现已据此将条例修改完毕，但因该条例尚系重点试行性质，故决定仍由本院公布施行。兹为贯彻该条例的执行起见，特作如下决定：
    一、中华人民共和国劳动保险条例从一九五一年三月一日起生效，即企业行政方面或资方应从三月份起缴纳劳动保险金；工人职员从五月一日起领取根据本条例应得的劳动保险费。
    二、凡根据本条例规定应实行劳动保险的各企业，自本决定公布之日起，其行政方面或资方，应会同各该企业工会基层委员会向当地人民政府劳动行政机关申请实行劳动保险的登记。其因经济特殊困难不易维持或尚未正式开工营业，经行政方面或资方与工会基层组织协商同意暂缓实行者，应申请当地人民政府劳动行政机关批准备案；如双方协商对是否实行不能取得一致意见时，应呈请当地人民政府劳动行政机关处理。上述各项手续均限于一九五一年三月十五日以前办理完竣。
    三、指定中国人民银行为代收与保管劳动保险金的总金库，其详细办法由该行与中央人民政府劳动部和中华全国总工会会商制定，并须通知全国各地分行支行于三月十日以前做好一切准备工作。
    四、实行劳动保险各企业的行政方面或资方应协同工会基层委员会，在四月底以前，做好本企业实施劳动保险的各项准备工作。
    五、中央劳动部应协同中华全国总工会，制定劳动保险条例实施细则，于本年三月上旬由劳动部公布之。
