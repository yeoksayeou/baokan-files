Following the timely promulgation of specific measures and methods by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to stabilize prices during the Spring Festival, a phenomenon of comprehensive price stability during the Spring Festival, unseen in more than a decade, appeared throughout the country. According to statistics from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, on February 3rd (the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month), the general price index of six major cities—Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing—rose by only 3.4% compared to the end of December last year. On February 12th (the seventh day of the first lunar month), the general price index of the above six major cities rose by only 3.9% compared to the end of December last year.

　　The streets of the capital were particularly abundant with various New Year goods on the market. The Beijing Native Produce Company purchased various kinds of New Year goods from all over the country for the market. On the one hand, it transported apples from Northeast China, tangerines from Jiangxi, and dried bamboo shoots and ham from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Beijing; on the other hand, it transported Longkou vermicelli from Beijing to the south. The business of various grocery stores was particularly prosperous, with a daily transaction volume of tens of millions of yuan. In order to supply the Spring Festival consumption, the fish merchants of the Xidan Vegetable Market specially raised funds to organize a joint purchasing team to go directly to Baotou to purchase 8,000 jin of Yellow River carp for the market. When the market opened after the Spring Festival, the prices did not change.

　　In Tianjin, the wholesale markets for grain, cotton yarn, and dried and fresh goods have all opened with "red discs," and the retail prices are roughly maintained at the original prices before the festival. State-owned trading companies had already prepared sufficient goods to supply the market before the festival. Because prices did not fluctuate during the holiday, business did not begin until the fourth day of the first lunar month. However, many private department stores, such as World, Wanyi, and Minzhong, opened as early as the second day of the new year in order to do more business due to stable prices, and only rested for one day. Zhongyuan Company, China Department Store Sales Office, Hongfeng, Renchang, and others held discount sales before the festival.

　　In Shanghai, the six major department stores, Yong'an, Xianshi, Daxin, Xinxin, Lihua, and China National Goods, have been extremely busy in recent months. The number of customers who come to buy New Year goods every day is between three and four thousand, or at least one thousand. Most of them are workers, civil servants, and suburban farmers. In the past, British wool and American cosmetics accounted for the largest proportion of New Year goods, but now they are replaced by pieces of cloth from domestic factories, especially local products, socks, and underwear. In Xinxin Company's daily turnover of nearly 100 million yuan, southern goods accounted for half, and the other companies also accounted for 30 to 40%. Because the goods sold are what the people need, the turnover has increased significantly; for example, Yong'an averages 200 million yuan per day, Xinxin 70 to 80 million yuan, and Lihua 40 to 50 million yuan, about double the usual; Daxin and China National Goods Company have also increased by about one and a half times. When the market opened during the Spring Festival, prices were also completely stable.

　　In Nanjing, the Federation of Industry and Commerce held a Spring Festival gathering to celebrate the improvement of industrial and commercial conditions over the past year. Thanks to the price stability last year, industrial and commercial enterprises operating properly have recovered and developed. At the end of 1949, there were 19,344 commercial households in Nanjing; by the end of 1950, it had increased to 19,940 households, including 3,110 newly opened households and 2,514 closed or transferred households. Generally speaking, industrial and commercial sectors in the city, such as cotton cloth, grain, hardware, and new medicines, all made considerable profits last year. According to preliminary statistics of self-reported and actual tax-paying households, the net profit rate of the yarn and cloth industry was 2.8% to 7.4%, the department store industry was about 3%, and the new medicine, kerosene, and cigarette industries were mostly above 4%. For example, a trading company on Zhongshan East Road that sells kerosene had a net profit rate of 16%. The above-mentioned industries mostly use the weighted average method to calculate the price of inventory, so they have basically changed the phenomenon of false profits and actual losses under the erosion of inflation for more than ten years.

　　In Wuhan and other markets in the Central and Southern China, although prices fluctuated slightly, they generally showed stability. Taking Wuhan as an example, in mid-January, rice rose by 3.76%, cotton yarn rose by 0.64%, cotton cloth rose by 3.18%, edible oil rose by 0.48%, table salt fell by 3.03%, and white sugar fell by 6.64% compared with the first ten days of the month; in the last ten days of the month, rice rose by 2.9%, cotton cloth fell by 4.01%, oil and salt rose slightly by about 1%, and cotton yarn continued to be stable compared with the middle ten days of the month. Since February, there have been fewer changes. In other places such as Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, and Liuzhou, since mid-to-late January, except for the low rice prices in Guangzhou and Liuzhou, which were reasonably raised by the grain company's purchases, other major daily necessities have continued to maintain basic stability. The main reasons are: First, trading companies in various regions have accumulated sufficient materials for supply. Many specialized companies canceled their weekly holidays in late January and extended their business hours to New Year's Eve in the lunar calendar to facilitate purchases by the general public. Second, cooperatives cooperated with state-owned trading companies to provide sufficient supplies to their members. Third, under the leadership of local industrial and commercial departments, they have successively implemented price negotiations within the same industry to ensure that prices will not rise. For example, after industry discussions, the price of wheat in Zhengzhou was reduced from 1,200 yuan to 1,150 yuan. Other vegetables, fish, meat, coal, etc. were also sold at evaluated prices with price tags.

　　The industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing implemented the five patriotic covenants with concrete actions. Since February 1st, the prices of various daily necessities have been reduced. For example, the market price of medium white sugar has been reduced from 5,800 yuan per jin to 5,400 yuan. Top-grade flour has been reduced from 2,200 yuan per jin to 1,800 yuan. Cooked rice has been reduced from 19,000 yuan per dou to 17,500 yuan, an average decrease of 11.65%. Pork has been reduced from 2,800 yuan per jin to 2,400 yuan, and wine has been reduced from 3,800 yuan per jin to 3,000 yuan per jin. The prices of other items such as salt, edible oil, and cigarettes have remained unchanged.

　　In Xi'an, workers, citizens, suburban farmers, and public educators who have worked hard for a year have all been able to fairly buy necessities and New Year goods due to stable prices. The price hikes during the Spring Festival that have occurred in the past ten years have been completely changed this year. The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium on January 30th for the vegetable, beef, pork, cigarette, and mountain goods industries. The heads and representatives of each industry unanimously guaranteed that prices would not be raised during the Spring Festival and that supplies would be ample. For example, the pork industry guaranteed that the price would not exceed 5,200 yuan per jin. Therefore, during the Spring Festival, various prices were very stable.

　　With stable prices throughout the country, farmers, whose purchasing power has increased due to the bumper harvest last year, are enthusiastically celebrating the happy Spring Festival and vying to buy New Year goods. Although rural supply and marketing cooperatives in many places prepared a large number of New Year goods early on, they were all sold out. Many private merchants in Zhangjiakou brought New Year goods to the countryside, and each time they were surrounded and bought out by the villagers. The Chahar Provincial State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and Department Store have sold more than 10 billion yuan worth of daily necessities in rural areas. The Shanxi Provincial State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and Department Store have recently allocated more than half of the province's daily consumption of materials to various rural areas; the General Cooperative has also sold a large number of New Year goods and 11,000 bolts of colored cloth. In Neihuang County, Pingyuan Province, more than 4.5 million jin of red dates were sold within a month. 10,000 jin of daylilies were sold in Anyang County. Many farm households in Chahar Province have painted their houses a new color, and some have installed glass in their windows. Many farm households in Xiajiaying Village, Shanyin, which has always been poor, have replaced the rotten mats that have been on the kang for many years with new mats and new cotton wadding this year. The peasants automatically tore off the statues of the God of Wealth, the Kitchen God, and the Bodhisattva that they had provided, and replaced them with portraits of Chairman Mao and New Year pictures. Mongolian herdsmen living far in the grassland area also bought back portraits of Chairman Mao and hung them in their yurts. Farmers and herdsmen in Ulanqab League and Ikezhao League in Suiyuan Province have bought a lot of white wine, boots, Hada (silk scarves for decoration and gifts), tea, and sugar that they like this year. All these show that the happy life of the vast people of the New China is beginning.

　　春节期间各地物价平稳
    在中央人民政府贸易部适时地颁布了春节期间稳定物价的具体措施和办法之后，全国各地出现了十多年来从未有过的春节期间物价全面稳定的现象。据中央人民政府贸易部的统计，二月三日（农历腊月二十七日），天津、上海、汉口、广州、西安、重庆六大城市物价总指数与去年十二月底比较，仅上升百分之三点四。二月十二日（农历正月初七日），上述六大城市的物价总指数与去年十二月底比较，仅升百分之三点九。
    首都的街头上，市面上各类年货特别丰盛。北京土产公司自南北各地采办了各式各样的年货应市。一方面把东北的苹果，江西的密橘，江、浙的笋干、火腿等运来北京，一方面又将北京的龙口粉丝南运。各杂货店的生意都特别兴隆。一天交易额达数千万元。西单菜市各鱼商为了供应春节消费，特地集资组织联购小组直接赴包头购回黄河鲤鱼八千斤应市。春节开盘，物价并无变化。
    在天津，目前粮食、花纱布、干鲜货等批发市场都开出了“红盘”，零售价格与批发价格，大致都保持节前的原价。各国营贸易公司供应市场货物，节前早已准备充足，因休假期中物价没有波动，到农历初四日才开始营业。私营百货业中却有不少商户如世界、万益、民众等商场因物价稳定，为多作生意，仅休息一天，初二即行开市。中原公司、中华百货售品所、宏丰、仁昌等并于节前举行了廉售。
    在上海，著名的永安、先施、大新、新新、丽华和中国国货等六大百货公司，近月来业务极其繁忙，每天上门选购年货的顾客，多则三、四千人，少则也在千人左右，大多数是工人、公务员、郊区农民。过去占年货比重最大的是英国呢绒和美国化装品，现在代之而起的却是一些本国工厂的匹头，特别是土产、袜子和内衣。新新公司一天近一亿元的营业额中，南货就占去了一半，其他各公司也占三、四成不等。由于所售商品是人民所需要的，营业额显著增加；如永安平均每天两亿元，新新七、八千万元，丽华四、五千万元，约比平时增加一倍；其他大新与中国国货公司也增加一倍半左右。春节时开盘，物价也是完全平稳。
    在南京，工商联合会并举行了春节团拜，庆祝一年来工商业情况的好转。由于去年的物价稳定，正当经营的工商业恢复和发展了。在一九四九年底，南京市共有商业一万九千三百四十四户；至一九五○年底，已增为一万九千九百四十户，其中新开三千一百一十户，闭歇转业二千五百一十四户。总的说来，全市工商业诸如棉布、粮食、五金、新药等业去年都获利不少。根据自报实缴户的初步统计，纱布业的纯利率为百分之二·八至百分之七·四，百货业百分之三左右，新药、煤油和卷烟业大都在百分之四以上，如中山东路一家经营煤油的贸易行，纯利率竟达百分之十六。上述各业大都是用加权平均法来计算存货价格的，因此基本上已改变了十几年来在通货膨胀侵蚀下的虚盈实亏的现象。
    在武汉及中南区各地市场，物价虽互有稍微涨落，但一般也呈现着稳定。以武汉为例，一月中旬较上旬大米升百分之三点七六，棉纱升百分之零点六四，棉布升百分之三点一八，食油升百分之零点四八，食盐落百分之三点零三，白糖落百分之六点六四；下旬较中旬大米升百分之二点九，棉布落百分之四点零一，油盐微升百分之一左右，花、纱继续平稳，二月份以来更少变动。其他如广州、长沙、南昌、郑州、柳州等地自一月中、下旬以来，除广州、柳州等地米价偏低，经粮食公司收购合理上提之外，其他主要日用货品，都继续保持基本稳定。主要原因是：首先，各地贸易公司积储了充分的物资从事供应，许多专业公司一月下旬便取消了星期例假，并将营业时间延长至旧历除夕，以便广大群众购买。其次是合作社配合国营贸易公司对社员作了充分的供应。第三，在各地工商部门的领导下，纷纷实行同业议价，保证概不涨价。如郑州小麦价经同业评议后，由一千二百元降低为一千一百五十元，其他蔬菜、鱼、肉、煤等也都实行了评价挂牌出售。
    重庆市工商界，以具体行动贯彻执行了五项爱国公约，自二月一日起将各类日用品价格降低，如中白糖市价由每斤五千八百元降至五千四百元。头号面粉由每斤二千二百元降至一千八百元，上熟米由每斗一万九千元降至一万七千五百元，平均下落百分之十一点六五。猪肉每斤自二千八百元减为二千四百元，酒每斤从三千八百元降低至每斤三千元，其他盐巴、食油、烟卷等物品均保持原价不动。
    在西安，辛勤劳动了一年的工人、市民、市郊农民及公教人员，都因物价稳定，公道地买到生活必需品和年货。过去十余年来的年关物价暴涨，今年是完全改变了。该市工商联于一月三十日召集了蔬菜、牛肉、猪肉、纸烟、山货各行业座谈会，各行业负责人和代表都一致保证春节不提价，大量供应，如猪肉业保证每斤不超过五千二百元。所以在春节期间，各项物价都很平稳。
    全国各地在物价平稳的情况下，因为去年丰收提高了购买力的农民，都热烈地过着快乐的春节，争相购买年货。许多地方的乡村供销合作社虽然很早就筹办了大批的年货，但都出售一空。张家口市很多私商办了年货下乡，每次都被村民包围买完，察省国营花纱布公司和百货公司已在农村售出了价值十多亿元的日用必需品。山西省国营花纱布公司和百货公司，最近拨运各地农村的物资超过全省日常用量的二分之一；合作总社亦售出大批年货和花色布一万一千多匹。平原省内黄县的红枣，一个月内就卖出了四百五十多万斤。安阳县的黄花菜卖出了一万斤。察哈尔省的许多农户把住房粉刷一新，有的窗子装上了玻璃。向来贫困的山阴夏家营村的许多农户，今年都将炕上多年的烂席片换上了新席子和新棉絮，农民们都自动地将所供的财神、灶王、菩萨像撕下，换上了毛主席像和新年画。远居草原地带的蒙族牧民，也都买回了毛主席像挂在蒙古包内。绥远省的乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟等地的农、牧民今年买到很多他们所喜爱的白酒、靴子、哈达（装饰和送礼用的绸绢）、茶和糖等。这些都表现了新中国广大人民的幸福生活正在开始。
