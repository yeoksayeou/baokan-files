　　Leadership Should Be Given to "Crosstalk"
　　Wang Liangcai
    I have recently listened to and watched some "crosstalk" programs on the radio in Tianjin and Beijing, as well as in theater programs in Tianjin. Many of these programs are performed by the most famous crosstalk actors. Generally speaking, the content of these new or reformed programs is relatively progressive, and they have indeed had some good influence on the audience. However, content errors, even very serious ones, continue to appear. I think if they are not corrected, they will inevitably lead to adverse results.
    For example, crosstalk actor Chang Baokun from Tianjin is an artist with a broad mass influence in Tianjin and even Beijing. He is one of the most popular figures among audiences and listeners in theaters, at evening parties, and on the radio. If his performance content contains political errors, the impact on the general audience will not be small. I recently saw him perform a program about "Spring Festival couplets." Its basic idea mainly opposes ordinary people "learning from the masses." According to him, only Chairman Mao can "learn from the masses" because Chairman Mao is a great leader who is "unprecedented and unsurpassed." Apart from him, no one is qualified to "learn from the masses." If anyone dares to "learn from the masses," then they must be a very bad person. Obviously, his view is completely wrong; it is precisely the opposite of Chairman Mao's thought. However, I saw many audience members applauding him enthusiastically, and even more strangely, many cadres were also applauding him enthusiastically. I think the general cadres are probably not affected by his erroneous propaganda, but for the general public, this may have adverse consequences. In addition, on January 5th, I heard Chang Baokun and Zhao Peiru performing crosstalk on a Tianjin radio station. The content was roughly about "character splitting." When they split "桃" (peach) into "木" (wood) and "兆" (omen), Chang Baokun said: "木兆 reads as 桃, Chairman Mao asked Lin Biao, where is Commander-in-Chief Zhu going? To resist America and aid Korea." This is simply unfounded nonsense. In a radio program on Beijing Radio, I also heard the program "Fake Doctor," in which the hero Liu Hulan appeared before the audience as a comical clown. There is no doubt that this is very inappropriate.
    As for the reason for these errors, I think, on the one hand, it is because the political level of some actors has not yet reached the required level, and they themselves cannot politically grasp the content of their performances. In this regard, of course, crosstalk actors still need to continue to work hard to improve themselves in order to avoid errors. On the other hand, I feel that the relevant literary and propaganda organs have not given these crosstalk programs effective political assistance, allowing them to perform freely. The latter reason is probably the main reason for the occurrence of the above errors. Therefore, I believe that the literary leadership organs should conduct appropriate checks on crosstalk programs and provide practical assistance to the programs performed by crosstalk actors.
    In addition, I have the following opinions on crosstalk: "Crosstalk" is originally a simple form of performance. Its characteristics are: 1. Suitable for satire; 2. Simple and flexible in form, suitable for popularization. Under the reactionary regime, crosstalk was often used to satirize the working people. Now, in the people's country, we should and can use this tool to satirize the enemy and appropriately use satirical methods to criticize the backwardness, conservatism, and various erroneous tendencies among our people. If we can correctly grasp this direction, "crosstalk" still has a certain role to play. However, if it is allowed to develop freely in politics, it will be detrimental to the people. Of course, after liberation, the literary authorities and crosstalk actors in various places have generally paid attention to this issue and have made some achievements. The problem is that the literary leadership organs in some places have not regularly provided leadership to this crosstalk program, which has a wide impact on the masses. This should be improved.

### 对“相声”应有领导

　　对“相声”应有领导
　　王量才
    我最近在天津和北京的广播节目中，以及在天津的剧场节目中，听了和看了一些“相声”节目，其中许多节目，都是最著名的相声演员演出的。这些新的或经过改造的节目的内容，一般地说，都是比较进步的，在听众和观众中，也的确发生了一些好影响。但内容错误，甚至于很严重的错误也不断出现。我想如果不加以纠正，必将造成不良的结果。
    比方，天津的相声演员常宝坤是天津甚至于北京有广大群众影响的艺人。他在剧场里、在晚会里、在广播里，都是观众和听众所极端欢迎的人物之一，如果他的演出内容发生政治错误，对一般观众听众的影响不会小。我最近曾看见他表演一个关于“春联”的节目，它的基本思想，主要地反对一般人“向群众学习”。按照他的说法，只有毛主席才可以“向群众学习”，因为毛主席是“前无古人，后无来者”的伟大领袖，除了他以外，任何人都没有资格“向群众学习”，如果有人敢于“向群众学习”，那就必然是很不好的人了。很显然，他这个观点是完全错误的，它恰恰和毛主席的思想相反。但是，我却看到很多观众向他热烈鼓掌，更奇怪的是许多干部也向他热烈鼓掌。我想，一般干部大概不至于受他的错误宣传的影响，但是，对于一般群众，这就可能产生不良的后果。另外，一月五日我曾经从天津一家电台广播中，听到常宝坤和赵佩如二人说相声，内容大致是说“拆字”，说到拆“桃”为“木”“兆”时，常宝坤说：“木兆念个桃，毛主席问林彪，朱总司令那里去？前去抗美援朝。”这简直是毫无根据的乱说。在北京电台的广播节目中，我也曾听到“假博士”的节目，里面把英雄刘胡兰作为一个滑稽小丑角色出现在听众之前。毫无疑问，这是很不应该的。
    至于发生这种错误的原因，我想，一方面是由于有些演员的政治水平还未提高到应有程度，他们自己还不能从政治上掌握自己演出的内容。这一方面，当然还须要相声演员们继续努力提高自己，以避免错误。另一方面，我觉得有关的文艺宣传机关，似乎对于这些相声节目，没有给以政治上切实的帮助，让它们自流地演出。而后一个原因，恐怕应当说是发生上述这样错误的主要原因。因此，我认为文艺领导机关，应当对于相声的节目加以适当的检查，对相声演员们所上演的节目加以切实的帮助。
    此外，我对相声有以下一些意见：“相声”本来是一种简单的演出形式。它的特点是：一、适宜于讽刺；二、形式简便灵活，宜于普及。在反动政权下面，相声经常被利用来讽刺劳动人民，现在，在人民的国家中，我们应当而且可能用这个工具去讽刺敌人，并适当地用讽刺方式批评我们人民中间的落后、保守及各种错误的倾向。如果能正确掌握这个方针，“相声”仍有它一定作用的。但是，如果在政治上任其自流，就会不利于人民。当然，在解放以后，各地文艺主管机关和相声演员们，已一般地注意了这一个问题，而且有了一些成绩。问题在于有些地方的文艺领导机关，还没有经常对于这一个广泛影响群众的相声节目加以领导。这是应当加以改进的。
