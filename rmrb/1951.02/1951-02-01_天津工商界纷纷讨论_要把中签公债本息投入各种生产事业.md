　　Tianjin's business community is actively discussing how to use the principal and interest from winning First Phase People's Victory Discount Bonds to invest in production enterprises. The news of the drawing for the repayment of principal for the First Phase Bonds caused great excitement in Tianjin's business community. The Tianjin branches of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce both held member seminars and seminars for chairmen of various industry associations. At the member seminar of the Tianjin branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Li Zhuchen called on bondholders to invest their First Phase People's Victory Discount Bonds, which had won repayment of principal and interest, into developing production enterprises. Zi Yaohua, manager of Shanghai Bank, further suggested: "It is hoped that this batch of organized funds can be used to establish an investment company to directly support production enterprises." Zhu Jisheng, manager of Renli Company, and Tan Zhiqing, manager of Fuzhong Company, immediately responded, expressing their willingness to invest the principal and interest of their winning bonds into the investment company.

　　At the seminar of the chairmen of 99 industry associations presided over by the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, attendees also unanimously agreed to invest the principal and interest of the winning bonds into production enterprises through an investment company. The Federation of Industry and Commerce also issued a call to the city's business community to collectively invest the principal and interest of the bonds that had won repayment into the investment company on a voluntary basis. Yong Dingchen, Han Yuesen, Ni Shuping, Xu Duanfu, and other gentry from the ten districts of Tianjin who purchased the most First Phase Bonds, also published written opinions in the Progressive Daily, agreeing to invest all the principal and interest from the winning bonds into the investment company, and hoping that wealthy households holding bonds would respond together.

　　天津工商界纷纷讨论
    要把中签公债本息
    投入各种生产事业
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津市工商界正纷纷讨论如何利用第一期人民胜利折实公债中签兑付本息投入生产事业。第一期公债抽签还本消息传津后，天津工商界极为兴奋。民主建国会天津分会、天津市工商联合会都举行了会员座谈会和各行业公会主委座谈会。在民主建国会天津分会会员座谈会上，李烛尘号召公债持有人将第一期中签还本付息的人民胜利折实公债投到发展生产事业上去。上海银行经理资耀华更建议：“希望把这一批有组织的资金，成立投资公司，来直接扶助生产事业。”仁立公司经理朱继圣、扶中公司经理谭志清立起响应，表示愿把个人中签公债本息投入投资公司。
    在天津市工商联合会主持的九十九个行业公会的主委座谈会上，到会者也一致赞成将中签公债的本息，通过投资公司，投向生产事业。工商联合会并为此发出号召，号召全市工商界在自愿的原则下，将此次中签兑付的公债本息，集体投入投资公司。津市十区购买第一期公债分数最多的雍鼎臣、韩悦森、倪叔平、徐端夫等士绅，亦在进步日报发表书面意见，赞成将公债中签兑付的本息全部投入投资公司，并希望持有公债的殷实富户共同响应。
