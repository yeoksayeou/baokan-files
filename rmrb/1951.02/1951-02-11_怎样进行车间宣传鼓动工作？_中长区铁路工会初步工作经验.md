　　How to Carry Out Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Workshops?
    —— Preliminary Work Experience of the Railway Trade Union in the Central and Chang District

            (I) Basic Content of Mobilization Work
    The first task of propaganda and mobilization work in the workshop is to inspire the broad masses of workers with the idea of ​​loving the motherland and hating the enemy. This is the center of all propaganda and mobilization. When we carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses of workers and inspire them to consciously engage in production, we should always run through this content. The second is to publicize the elimination of accidents and to wage a tenacious struggle against accidents. This is an important part of propaganda and mobilization. Because accidents are stubborn enemies in the railway transportation industry, they often seriously threaten the completion of production tasks in various departments. To eliminate accidents, we must first eliminate all kinds of paralyzing thoughts among workers, because paralyzing thoughts are the root of all accidents. To eliminate accidents, we must, in light of the development stage of the work and the ideological situation of the workers, use slogans and slogans familiar to the masses to stimulate the masses to consciously rise up to eliminate accidents with confidence. The first shift (now the second shift) of the Sujiatun Station Dispatching Section often had accidents. The trade union's slogan for this shift was: "Workers of the first shift, whether or not this production competition will be victorious depends on you!" At the summary, the first shift was victorious. To publicize the elimination of accidents, heroic figures must be commended in a timely manner, and good methods for eliminating accidents must be quickly disseminated to promote typical experience to the full. For example, the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot Factory displayed the best finished products on the standard product exhibition stand for everyone to observe. Defective products were greatly reduced. To publicize the elimination of accidents, necessary criticisms must be made of individual major accidents in the blackboard newspapers and all mobilization tools, because it can arouse the vigilance of those who have accidents. For example, the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot used comic strips and jingles to criticize stokers who violated labor discipline.
    The workshop propaganda and mobilization work again is to encourage workers to strive to complete production and financial plans ahead of schedule. What are some ways to do this? First, we must implement the idea of ​​economic accounting. We must seize the key to production, check waste, launch a detailed accounting campaign, and establish the idea of ​​ownership among workers. Second, use scientific production competition charts. Because it can specifically organize workers to compete and achieve comprehensive improvement. Because it has scientific comparative figures, it enables leaders to be aware of the situation, grasp the competition, and promote experience at any time. For example, the Shenyang Locomotive Depot wasted 195 tons and 335 kilograms of coal in August last year. The situation has been different since the establishment of the red and blue comparison table. According to statistics in September last year, the 冖ㄎ6一○一3冖ㄎ locomotive alone saved 16 tons and 700 kilograms of coal. Finally, we must implement new technologies and promote advanced experience. Before implementing any new method, we must expose old conservative ideas and organize demonstrations by advanced backbones, because only in this way can the old method bow its head and the new method be implemented. In the process of promoting new methods, we must promptly correct certain adventurist and hasty tendencies.

            (II) Forms of Mobilization Work and Their Application
    Slogans - Understanding the central link in each movement and operation process, concentrating the thoughts, will, and emotions of the masses, putting forward timely and vivid mobilization slogans targeted at certain situations and key points, and constantly improving the content of slogans, replacing old slogans with new slogans - this is the main key to propaganda and mobilization work. For example, the Mudanjiang Inspection Section's repair shop used to not hand over the cars after finishing work, but waited until dark to hand them over, making it difficult for inspectors. Therefore, the factory, in response to this phenomenon, put forward such a slogan: "Finish one car, hand over one car, don't wait until evening." The quality of the cars repaired by the factory has improved.
    Production Charts - According to the experience of the Dalian Railway Factory, new production charts are a new direction for propaganda and mobilization work. It can specifically organize workers to compete, it can compare the work achievements of each worker (such as saving and waste) with scientific figures, so that workers have a clear understanding, and it implements the idea of ​​economic accounting. It not only has a mobilization effect, but also is a specific organizer of production competitions. Production charts can also enable competition leaders to grasp the competition based on the charts, understand the work of each group and each person in the entire factory at any time, and study the reasons and promote experience.
    The following must be noted when promoting production charts: Production charts should be established according to each different business department, such as "saving coal and oil" for locomotive operations, and "shortening turnover rate" and "station stop time" for station operations, otherwise the mobilization effect of the chart will be lost.
    The content and items of the chart competition must be clear and easy to understand, and there must be a center. And make it permeate a certain amount of political content and artistry, so that the chart has ideological significance.
    Before implementing a certain chart, it must also be studied and discussed with the masses so that the masses know the content and nature of the competition chart and attach importance to it. In this way, the chart can achieve the role of calling and organizing the broad masses of workers. At the same time, we must summarize experience at any time in order to achieve the goal of "competing with each other and improving each other." The promotion of charts should be widespread, and each different unit and group should not be restricted by time, place, and business.
    Advanced Demonstration - The demonstration and mobilization of advanced backbones is a method of mobilization that promotes the whole by promoting a point. It educates the whole with practical typical experience, breaks through obstacles, and achieves complete improvement. For example, when the Songshu Road Maintenance Section began to implement the new road maintenance method, the workers had conservative ideas, disliked the tools being too many, messy, and troublesome, so the new road maintenance method could not be implemented, and the daily progress was only four meters. Later, the Dashiqiao Engineering Section drew outstanding new method operation workers from various road maintenance sections to form a demonstration team to demonstrate in Songshu. As a result, the new road maintenance method was quickly implemented, and eight meters were completed in one day. This demonstration method can be implemented in every specific task.
    Recently, the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot has created a new form of demonstration and mobilization - the championship competition. It focuses on key points and needs of the work, and writes the clear words "Coal Saving Expert" on the red armband. Whoever can meet the conditions for winning the championship in advance can wear this glorious armband. This new form of mobilization can be smoothly promoted in various business departments and can be combined with the promotion of experience.
    There are many forms of demonstration and mobilization, such as advanced production technology report meetings, symposiums, visits, blackboard newspapers with typical introductions, communications, comic strips, etc. These forms can be used flexibly in different situations.

　　怎样进行车间宣传鼓动工作？        
    ——中长区铁路工会初步工作经验
　　冷超
            （一）鼓动工作的基本内容
    车间宣传鼓动工作首先是要启发广大职工热爱祖国仇视敌人的思想。这是一切宣传鼓动的中心。我们在向广大职工进行宣传教育，启发职工自觉地进行生产时，都应该贯穿这一内容。其次是宣传消灭事故、向事故作顽强的斗争。这是宣传鼓动的一个重要内容。因为事故是铁路运输事业中的顽强敌人，它经常严重地威胁着各个部门的生产任务的完成。消灭事故，首先要消灭职工中的各种麻痹思想，因为麻痹思想是一切事故的根源。消灭事故，必须针对工作的发展阶段，针对职工的思想情况，运用群众所熟悉的口号标语，激发群众自觉地起来消灭事故的信心。苏家屯站运转第一班（现为二班）常出事故，工会给这班的口号是：“第一班工友们，这回生产竞赛能否胜利就在于你们了！”总结时，一班获得胜利。宣传消灭事故，必须及时表扬英雄人物，并迅速传播消灭事故的好办法，把典型经验推广到全面。如牡丹江机务段工厂把最好的成品，陈列在标准品展览台上，给大家观摩。废品遂大大减少。宣传消灭事故，必须在黑板报和一切鼓动工具上，对个别重大事故进行必要的批评，因为它能引起发生事故者的警惕。如牡丹江机务段用连环画和顺口溜的形式，批评违犯劳动纪律的司炉。
    车间宣传鼓动工作再次是要鼓舞职工争取提前完成生产财务计划。有些什么办法呢？第一，要贯彻经济核算思想。必须抓住生产中的关键，检查浪费，展开算细账运动，在工人中树立主人翁的思想。第二，运用科学的生产竞赛图表。因为它能具体的组织工人进行竞赛，达到全面提高。因为它有科学的比较数字，使领导者心里有数，掌握竞赛，随时推广经验。如沈阳机务段去年八月份浪费煤达一九五吨零三三五公斤。自建立了红蓝色比较表之后，情况便不同了。据去年九月份统计，仅冖ㄎ６一○一三冖ㄎ机车就省煤十六吨零七百公斤。最后是贯彻新技术，推广先进经验。在实行任何新法之前，必须揭破旧的保守主义思想，组织先进骨干的示范，因为只有如此，旧法才能低头，新法才能贯彻。而在推行新法运动中，必须及时纠正某些冒险主义与操之过急的偏向。
            （二）鼓动工作的形式及其运用
    口号——了解每一个运动和作业过程中的中心环节，集中群众的思想、意志、情绪，针对某些情况和重点，提出及时的生动的鼓动口号，并不断提高口号的内容，以新口号代替旧口号——这是宣传鼓动工作的主要关键。如牡丹江检车段修车厂，过去干完活不交车，到天黑才交车，使验收员为难，于是工厂针对这个现象，提出这样的口号：“干完一辆，交一辆，别等延迟到晚上。”该厂修车的质量就提高了。
    生产图表——根据大连铁路工厂的经验，新的生产图表是宣传鼓动工作的新方向。它能够具体地组织工人进行比赛，它能够把每个工人的工作成绩（如节省与浪费），用科学的数字比较出来，使工人心中有数，并贯彻了经济核算思想。它不但有鼓动作用，而且是生产竞赛的具体组织者。生产图表又能使竞赛的领导者根据图表掌握竞赛，随时了解全厂每个小组、每个人的工作好坏，并研究其原因，推广经验。
    在推广生产图表时必须注意：生产图表要根据每个不同的业务部门建立，如机务是“省煤省油”，站务上是“缩短周转率”、“停站时间”，否则会丧失图表的鼓动作用。
    图表竞赛的内容与项目，必须明了易懂，要有中心。并使其渗透一定的政治内容和艺术性，这样图表才具备了思想性。
    实行某种图表之前，又必须和群众共同研究讨论，使群众知道竞赛表的内容、性质，而且重视它。这样，图表才会达到号召与组织广大职工的作用。同时，要随时总结经验，以便达到“互相比赛，互相提高”的目的。图表的推广应该是广泛的，每个不同的单位、小组均不受时间、地点与业务的限制。
    先进示范——先进骨干的示范鼓动，是以一点推动全面的鼓动方式。它以实际的典型经验教育全体，突破阻碍，达到全部提高。如松树养路工区开始实行新养路法时，工人有保守思想，嫌工具多、零乱、麻烦，新养路法就搞不起来，每天的进度才四公尺。后由大石桥工务段从各养路工区抽调优秀的新法作业职工，组织示范队，到松树示范。结果，新养路法很快地搞起来了，一天进行了八公尺。此种示范方式，可以贯彻到每件具体工作中去。
    最近，牡丹江机务段又创造出新的示范鼓动形式——夺标竞赛。它针对工作重点和需要，在红色的袖标上写着“省煤能手”的鲜明字样。谁能提前具备夺标的条件，谁就能带上这种光荣的袖标。这种新的鼓动形式，在各业务部门都能够顺利推广，并能和推广经验结合起来做。
    示范鼓动的形式很多，如先进生产技术报告会、座谈会、参观、访问、黑板报上典型介绍、通讯、连环画等。这些形式可在不同情况下灵活运用。
