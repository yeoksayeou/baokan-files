　　East China and North China, Northeast Cooperation General Agency Sign Contract to Expand Native Produce Exchange

　　[By Our Newspaper] The East China Cooperative General Agency has signed a business contract for the first quarter of this year with the Northeast and North China Cooperative General Agencies, as well as cooperative societies at all levels within the East China region, to vigorously develop the exchange of various native products and daily necessities.

　　According to the contract, the North China and Northeast Cooperative General Agencies should exchange soybeans, corn, sorghum, etc., with the East China Cooperative General Agency for red sugar, tea, bamboo seedlings, factory cloth, towels, socks, and straw mats of equal value. Contracts signed with cooperative societies in various provinces and cities in the East China region will use a large number of daily necessities to exchange for local native and special products to supply Shanghai's needs. Contractual transactions between the three major administrative regions will play a significant role in shortening commodity circulation and promoting economic prosperity.

　　Over the past year, under the guidance of the principle of "upper-level societies serving lower-level societies," the East China Cooperative General Agency, in addition to independently purchasing materials to meet the needs of Shanghai members and citizens, has also helped lower-level societies sell many local products. The most important of these include edible oil, skin pigs, raw peanuts, vermicelli, and tobacco from Shandong; preserved meats, daylily, alkaline eggs, and peppermint oil from northern Jiangsu; wool, eggs, and moso bamboo from southern Jiangsu; tea, mats, hemp skin from northern Anhui; and sleepers, tung oil, and charcoal from southern Anhui, with a value of nearly 200 billion yuan. The value of goods distributed to the countryside by lower-level societies included socks, towels, soap, matches, kerosene, rubber shoes, cloth, and stationery, totaling approximately 81 billion yuan.

　　Last year, East China saw a rare bumper harvest of agricultural products, and rural sideline production also experienced large-scale development. Local cooperative societies have tried their best to sell local products and then transported the production and living materials urgently needed by local farmers from other places. Therefore, cooperative societies between counties, between counties and provinces, and between provinces have carried out huge and complex exchange work, which has played a significant role in improving the economic lives of farmers and opening up sales channels for industrial products.

　　The volume of agricultural products purchased on behalf of state-owned specialized companies has increased with the development of the cooperative societies themselves. The amount of cotton purchased by the Northern Jiangsu Society accounted for 60% of the total purchased by the local trading company; the amount of silkworm cocoons purchased by the Southern Jiangsu Society accounted for more than 30%; and the amount of tea purchased by the Southern Anhui Society accounted for 40%. The total amount of eggs purchased accounted for nearly 80% of the total purchased by the regional trading company. This fully demonstrates that cooperative societies have played a significant role in assisting state-owned companies in completing their purchasing tasks.

　　After November, in order to further consolidate price stability, various specialized companies once reduced the amount of purchase funds invested. Moreover, private merchants took the opportunity to drive down prices, and the prices of agricultural products in various regions fell one after another, while the members in most areas still had many products that urgently needed to be sold. Therefore, the cooperative societies in Shandong, Zhejiang, and Southern Jiangsu began to handle credit purchase businesses under these circumstances. The cooperative societies in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu were established not long ago and had a slightly weaker foundation, so the scope of credit purchases was also smaller. The Shandong Provincial Society signed a two-month credit purchase contract with the cotton yarn, oil, and native products companies, entrusting the society to purchase 10 million catties of cotton, 26 million catties of raw rice, and 1 million catties of tobacco from members and farmers on behalf of the three companies. The Taian, Wendeng, and Dezhou special district societies also successively handled credit purchases. On the first day of credit purchases in Xiahe Village, Kunlun County, 245 farmers purchased more than 3,700 catties of raw rice on credit. By the end of the year, the Shandong Society had purchased 3 million catties of cotton, 20 million catties of raw rice, and 500,000 catties of tobacco on credit. However, before the implementation of the credit purchase method, due to insufficient publicity, cadres in individual units hurriedly arranged work in order to complete the task quickly. In the Wenshan District of Kunlun County, some farmers reflected: "Seeing how urgent this is, I'm afraid the raw rice price will rise." Some farmers also believed that the method of calculating prices at the listed price upon the expiration of the credit, only listening to increases but not decreases, was that the listed price was controlled by the company, and they were afraid that the price would be suppressed in the future. In addition, the complexity of the procedures also hindered the development of the business to a certain extent.

### 华东与华北、东北合作总社订立合同扩大土产交流

　　华东与华北、东北合作总社订立合同扩大土产交流
    【本报讯】华东合作总社已与东北、华北合作总社及华东区范围内的各级合作社订立今年第一季度的业务合同，大力开展各种土产和日用品的交流业务。
    根据合同规定：华北、东北合作总社应以大豆、玉米、红粮等，向华东合作总社调换同等价值的红糖、茶叶、竹苗、厂布、毛巾、袜子和草席等。与华东区内各省市合作社所签订的合同，将以大量的日用品交换各地土、特产供应上海需要。三大行政区间的合同交易，对缩短商品流通过程、促进经济繁荣将发生很大的作用。
    过去一年来，在“上级社为下级社服务”的方针指导下，华东合作总社除自行对外采购物资以满足上海社员和市民的需要外，并代下级社推销了很多土产。其中最主要的如山东的食油、皮猪、生仁、粉丝、烟叶，苏北的腌腊、金针菜、碱蛋、薄荷油，苏南的羊毛、鸡蛋、毛竹，皖北的茶叶、席子、麻皮，皖南的枕木、桐油和木炭等，价值近二千亿元。通过下级社下乡的百货有袜子、毛巾、肥皂、火柴、火油、胶鞋、布匹和文具等，价值约八一○亿元。
    去年华东区农产品丰收，是十多年来少见的现象，农村副业的经营也有大规模的发展。各地合作社曾将本地的产品尽量设法推销，然后又把当地农民所急需的生产、生活资料从外地运来，因此在县与县、县与省、省与省间的合作社便相互开展了庞大而复杂的交流工作，对改善农民的经济生活，打开工业品销路，都起了很大作用。
    代理国营各专业公司收购的农产品，随着合作社本身业务的发展而日益增大。苏北社代收的棉花量占当地贸易公司收购总额的六成；苏南社代收的蚕茧量占三成多；皖南社代收的茶叶占四成。蛋的收购总量占区贸易公司收购总额的八成弱。足证合作社在协助国营公司完成收购的任务上，已起了很大的作用。
    十一月份以后，各专业公司为进一步巩固物价稳定，一度减少收购资金的投放，又因私商乘机杀价，各地农产品价格相继下跌，而大部地区社员手中仍有很多产品急待脱手。因此山东、浙江、苏南三地合作社便在这一情况下开始办理赊购业务。浙江、苏南合作社建立不久，基础稍差，赊购范围也较小。山东省社则与花纱布、油脂、土产三公司签订了为期两月的赊购合同，由该社代三公司向社员、农民赊购棉花一千万斤，生米二千六百万斤，烟叶一百万斤。泰安、文登、德州三专区社也相继办理赊购。昆仑县小河村开始赊购第一天，就有农民二四五人赊出生米三千七百多斤。到年底止，山东社已赊进的物资，计棉花三百万斤，生米二千万斤，烟叶五○万斤。但在赊购办法实行之前，由于宣传工作做得不够，个别单位的干部为求迅速完成任务，匆忙布置工作，在昆仑县文山区就有农民反映：“看这样急，恐怕生米要涨价啦。”对于赊货到期按牌价计算，听涨不听落的办法，也有农民认为牌价系由公司掌握，怕将来压价；另外，手续的复杂也在一定程度上妨碍了业务的开展。
