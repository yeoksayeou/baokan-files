　　Mathematics is a subject in which the Chinese people excel
    Hua Luogeng
    In the past, imperialists not only economically exploited us and politically enslaved us, turning our country into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state, but also culturally—through their churches, schools, hospitals, and so-called charitable organizations—attacked our national self-esteem and self-confidence. Political aggression is visible and involves bloodshed; economic aggression is felt and causes acute pain. Only cultural aggression, initially disguised in a sweet coat, eventually makes you forget your ancestors and recognize the thief as your father. The brilliance of this aggressive tactic lies in subtly and unconsciously, inadvertently, and imperceptibly leading us to believe that we are backward in everything and inferior to others in all aspects. Undoubtedly, this poison will make us lose our souls and fighting spirit, plunging us into eternal doom.
    In reality, our great motherland and people have had unparalleled achievements of wisdom in human history. Even in the realm of science, which some self-deprecating individuals consider "not our strength," it is not as empty or impoverished as they imagine. If we were to list them in detail, it would exceed the scope of a short article and the author's knowledge. Now, I will only present a few examples from mathematics, which I know a little about. I ask readers to use an objective attitude and fair position to judge and analyze for themselves whether we are the "inferior race" that imperialists claim, or whether "science is our weakness," as some with inferiority complexes or deeply poisoned minds say.
    Before entering the discussion, I must first state that I am not a historian of Chinese mathematics, and my knowledge does not allow me to conduct in-depth research. The purpose of this article is only to remind our compatriots that mathematics is our strength. I have not considered whether the timing of inventions is definitively established or whether the examples are comprehensively representative. At the same time, I am not boasting about the advantages of our nation and considering us superior. I personally believe that both superiority and inferiority complexes are deviations. Only imperialists distinguish between the superiority and inferiority of races to provide a theoretical basis for the exploitation of people by people and the oppression of people by people. It is certainly glorious to make discoveries and make them early, but the fact that a nation did not make discoveries early does not prove their inferiority. Because culture is a reflection of economics and politics. Therefore, it is unfair and biased to measure the wisdom of a nation by the earliness of its inventions.
            (I) The squares of the gou and gu are added together to form the shi of the xian; extracting the square root yields the xian.
    Someone has fancifully suggested: if there are also highly intelligent beings on other planets, and we want to communicate with them, what method can we use to make them understand? Obviously, words and languages are not effective tools. Even pictures are ineffective, because the images of beings there may be different from ours, and our "human form" may be their "strange shape." At the same time, customs may be different, and our "handshake" may be their "fighting pose." Therefore, some people suggest using the mathematical figure on the left as a medium. Of course, what is said above is a joke, but it illustrates that this figure is a reflection of a universal truth. And this figure was created by our ancestors, with a recorded history of more than two thousand years! Of course, this is also the product of the working people, used to determine right angles, calculate areas, and measure heights and depths. Its creation must have been long before it was recorded in books. Our ancient books contain more than just this one special case; they further state: "The squares of the gou and gu are added together to form the shi of the xian; extracting the square root yields the xian." In modern language: "The sum of the squares of the lengths of the two sides enclosing the right angle in a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the side opposite the right angle." This is the theorem that the West admires as "Pythagoras's" theorem. And the description of this theorem is earlier than that of Pythagoras.
            (II) Pi
    Speaking of pi, we also have a glorious history. The record of a circumference of three for a diameter of one is extremely ancient. Liu Hui's (Han Dynasty, around 263 AD) method of exhaustion, not only laid the foundation for calculating pi, but also clarified the basis for calculating lengths and areas in integral calculus. He used broken lines to gradually approach curves and polygons to gradually approach figures enclosed by curves. He calculated pi by successively bisecting from an inscribed hexagon, dodecagon, 24-gon, etc. The value of pi he calculated was 3.1416. In the Song Dynasty (429-500 AD), Zu Chongzhi calculated it more precisely and foreshadowed the budding of asymptotic value theory. For example, he proved that pi was between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, and used 22/7 and 355/113 as the sparse ratio and dense ratio. In modern research on asymptotic fractions, these two fractions are precisely the first two terms of the "best asymptotic fractions" that are spoken of today (the next term is extremely complicated). Zu Chongzhi's dense ratio was more than a thousand years earlier than the German Otto (Otto's record is 1573).
            (III) The Great Extension of Unity
    Also known as "Undetermined Number," "Guigu Calculation," "Separated Wall Calculation," "Qin Wang's Secret Troop Count," "Unknown Total Number of Objects," "Cut Reed Calculation," "Han Xin's Troop Count," etc., and called the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" by European and American scholars.
    The problem states: "Now there is an unknown number of objects. When counted in groups of three, there is a remainder of two; when counted in groups of five, there is a remainder of three; when counted in groups of seven there is a remainder of 2. What is the number of objects?"
    The algorithm rhyme: "Three people walking together, seventy is rare,
                  Five plum blossoms, twenty-one branches,
                Seven children reunite in mid-January,
                  Subtract one hundred and five to know."
    Algorithm: Multiply the remainder of the division by three by seventy, multiply the remainder of the division by five by twenty-one, multiply the remainder of the division by seven by fifteen, add them all together, and subtract multiples of one hundred and five to get the answer. For example: for the previous question, two multiplied by seventy, plus three multiplied by twenty-one, plus two multiplied by fifteen, the total number is two hundred and thirty-three, subtract two hundred and ten, and get twenty-three.
    This problem not only has its high status in history, but even today, if compared with the methods in foreign number theory books, it is not difficult to find that our method still has its advantages. How concrete it is! Simple! And easy to calculate the result!
    This method originated from the Sunzi Suanjing (a book from the Han Dynasty), earlier than Diophantus of Greece. It was developed by Qin Jiushao's Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections (1247), about five hundred years earlier than the European masters Euler (1707-1783), Lagrange (1736-1813), and Gauss (1777-1855). At the same time, Qin Jiushao also invented the Euclidean algorithm.
            (IV) Yang Hui's Source of Square Root Extraction
                          1
                        1  1
                      1  2  1
                    1  3  3  1
                  1  4  6  4  1
                1  5 10 10 5  1
              1  6 15 20 15 6  1
    The construction rule of this triangle is that both sides are 1. Each number in it is the sum of the two numbers on its shoulders. This triangle is the basic algorithm of the binomial theorem. This is what Western scholars call Pascal's (1654) triangle. But according to Western mathematical historians, the earliest inventor was Aplanus, in 1527. But our Yang Hui (1261), Zhu Shijie (1303), and Wu Xinmin (1450) all discovered it more than two hundred years earlier than Aplanus.
            (V) Qin Jiushao's Equation Theory
    Horner's method in higher algebra is the basic method for solving numerical equations. It was invented by Horner in 1819. But if we examine our mathematical history, it is not difficult to find that the principle of this method was already known in "Yigu Genyuan" (around 1080). After the development of Liu Yi and Jia Xian, Qin Jiushao (1247) already had a complete method, 572 years earlier than Horner. Li Zhi (1248) and Zhu Shijie (1299), who continued to use this method, were both more than 500 years earlier than Horner.
    (In ancient times, astronomy and mathematics were inseparable. We also have a glorious history in astronomy, such as Guo Shoujing's precession of the equinoxes, etc., but it is not within the scope of this article.)
    Of course, if we continue to excavate, we will find more, better, and more valuable materials. But we must not shy away from the fact that after the late Yuan Dynasty, our mathematics once stagnated, and even regressed a little. The reason for the stagnation was not because the intelligence of the people declined, but because of changes in the environment, such as the emphasis on martial arts in the Yuan Dynasty and the eight-legged essay examination in the Ming Dynasty. At the same time, the production situation has been stagnating in the feudal society stage, while Europe, after the Renaissance, entered the capitalist society. As a result, their mathematics has advanced by leaps and bounds, creating the current significant difference!
    But this difference is temporary! Not fundamental!
    It is not difficult to annotate these sentences. In ancient times, we entered the civilization stage earlier (referring to the civilization stage mentioned by Engels), so our mathematical development started earlier than in Europe. During the period of European ignorance, we had significant contributions. We may well be proud and encouraged by the great achievements of our ancestors, but we must not be complacent and develop a superior feeling of self-importance. Later, the rise of European capitalism (which also had its progressiveness at the time) promoted the further development of mathematics, while we temporarily appeared backward. Therefore, we do not need to be discouraged by this backward phenomenon and think that everything is inferior to others, thus producing an inferiority complex. Today, if we compare capitalist society with new democratic society, socialist and communist society, the difference between superior and inferior is another era. Therefore, I dare to assert that in the near future, when the new cultural upsurge foreshadowed by Chairman Mao arrives, our mathematics - in fact, the entire science and the entire culture - will advance by leaps and bounds and occupy a particularly important position in the world. The recent situation in the Soviet Union is enough to confirm this! (Attached image)

　　数学是我国人民所擅长的学科
    华罗庚
    从前帝国主义者不但在经济上剥削我们，在政治上奴役我们，使我国变成半殖民地半封建的国家。同时又从文化上——透过他们所办的教会、学校、医院、和所谓慈善机关——来打击我们民族的自尊和自信。政治侵略是看得见的，是要流血的；经济侵略是觉得着的，有切肤之痛的。唯有文化侵略，开始是甜蜜蜜的外衣，结果使你忘却了自己的祖先而认贼作父。这种侵略伎俩的妙处在不知不觉之中，有意无意之间，潜移默化地揽得我们自认为事事落后，凡事不如人。无疑地，这种毒素将使我们忘魂失魄，失却斗志，因而陷入万劫不复的境地。
    实际上我们祖国伟大人民在人类史上，有过无比的睿智的成就，即以若干妄自菲薄的人认为“非我所长”的科学而论，也不如他们所设想的那么空虚，那么贫乏。如果详细地一一列举，当非一篇短文所能尽，也不在笔者的知识范围之内。现在仅就我所略知的数学，提出若干例证。请读者用客观的态度，公正的立场，自己判断，自己分析，看看我们是否如帝国主义者所说的“劣等民族”，是否如若干有自卑感的或中毒已深的人所说的“科学乃我之所短”。
    在未进入讨论之前，我得先声明一下，我不是中国数学史家，我的学识也不容许我做深刻的研讨。本文的目的仅在向国人提示：数学乃我之擅长。至于发明时间的肯定，举例是否依照全面性的范畴，都未顾及。同时我也并非夸耀我民族的优点，而认为高人一筹的，我个人认为优越感和自卑感同是偏差。只有帝国主义者才区别人种的优劣，而为人剥削人、人压迫人的主义做理论基础。有发现的，发现得早的固然是光荣，但没有早日发明的民族，并不足以证明他们的低劣。因为文化是经济及政治的反映。所以如果拿发明的迟早来衡量民族的智慧，那也是不公平的偏颇之论。
            （一）句股各自乘，并之为弦实，开方除之，即弦也。
    有人异想天开地提出：如果其他星球上也有高度智慧的生物，而我们要和他们通消息，用什么方法可以使他们了解？很明显的，文字和语言都不是有效的工具。就是图画也失却效用，因为那儿的生物形象也许和我们不同，我们的“人形”，也许是他那儿的“怪状”。同时习俗也许不同，我们的“举手礼”也许是他们那儿的“开打姿势”。因此有人建议，把左边的数学图形用来做媒介。以上所说当然是一笑话，不过这说明了这图形是一普遍真理的反映。而这图形正是我先民所创造的，见诸纪载的就有二千年以上的历史了！当然这也是劳动人民的产物，用来定直角、算面积、测高深的。其创造当远在纪录于书籍之前。我们古书所载还不仅此一特例，还更进一步地有：“句股各自乘，并之为弦实，开方除之，即弦也。”换成近代语：“直角三角形夹直角两边的长的平方和，等于对直角的边长的平方。”这就是西洋所羡称的“毕达哥拉”氏定理。而这定理的叙述，却较毕氏为早。
            （二）圆周率
    谈到圆周率，我们也有光荣的历史，径一周三的纪载是极古的。汉朝刘徽（纪元二六三时人）的割圆术，不但奠定了计算圆周率的基础，同时他也阐明了积分学上算长度算面积的基础。他用折线逐步地来接近曲线，用多角形来逐渐地接近曲线所包围的图形。他由圆内接六边形，十二边形，二十四边形等；逐步平分。来计算圆周率。他算出的圆周率是三·一四一六。在宋时（纪元四二九——五○○）祖冲之算得更精密并且预示着渐近值论的萌芽，例如他证明圆周率在三·一四一五九二六与三·一四一五九二七之间。并且用２２　７及３５５　１１３做疏率和密率。在近代渐近分数的研讨之下，这两个分数，正是现代所说的“最佳渐近分数”的前二项（下一项异常繁复）。祖冲之的密率较德人奥托早了一千多年（奥托的纪录是一五七三年）。
            （三）大衍求一术
    又名“物不数”、“鬼谷算”、“隔墙算”、“秦王暗点兵”、“物不知总”、“剪管术”、“韩信点兵”等等，欧美学者称为“中国剩余定理”。
    问题叙述：“今有物不知其数，三三数之剩二，五五数之剩三，七七数之剩二，问物几何？”
    算法歌诀：“三人同行七十稀，
                  五树梅花廿一枝，
                七子团圆正月半，
                  除百零五便得知。”
    算法：以三三数之的余数乘七十，五五数之的余数乘二十一，七七数之的余数乘十五，总加之，减去一百○五的倍数即得所求。例如：前设之题：二乘七十，加三乘二十一，再加二乘十五，总数是二百三十三，减去二百一十，得二十三。
    这问题不但在历史上有他的崇高的地位，就是到了今天，如果和外国的数论书籍上的方法相比较，不难发现，我们的方法还是有它的优越性。它是多么地具体！简单！且容易算出结果来！
    这方法肇源于孙子算经（汉时书籍）较希腊丢番都氏为早。光大于秦九韶之数学九章（一二四七年）较欧洲大师欧拉（Euler,1707—1783）拉格朗日（Tagrange,1736—1813）高斯（Ga,uss1777—1855）约早五百年。同时秦九韶也发明了欧几里得算法。
            （四）杨辉开方作法本源
                          １
                        １  １
                      １  ２  １
                    １  ３  ３  １
                  １  ４  ６  ４  １
                １  ５ １０１０ ５  １
              １  ６ １５２０１５ ６  １
    这种三角形之构造法则，两腰都是一。其中每数为其两肩二数之和。此三角形是二项式定理的基本算法。这就是西方学者所称的巴斯噶（Pascal,1654）三角形。但根据西洋数学史家考证，最先发明者是阿批阿奴斯（Aplanus），时在一五二七年。但我国的杨辉（一二六一）朱世杰（一三○三）及吴信民（一四五○）都在阿氏之前，早发现了二百余年。
            （五）秦九韶的方程论
    大代数上的和涅（Horner）氏法是解数值方程氏的基本方法。是和涅氏在一八一九年所发明的。但如果查考一下我们的数学史不难发现在“议古根源”（约一○八○年）早已知道这方法的原理。中间经过刘益、贾宪的发展，到了秦九韶（一二四七）已有了完整的方法，比和涅早了五百七十二年，续用此法的李冶（一二四八）朱世杰（一二九九）都比和涅早了五百多年。
    （在古代天文和数学是不能分开的，我们对天文学也有他光荣的史实，如郭守敬的岁差等等，但不在本文范围之内。）
    当然如果我们继续发掘，我们还会发现更多更好更宝贵的材料。但也不必讳言，在元代末季之后，我们的数学曾经停滞过，甚且退步了些。停滞的原因，并不是因为人民的智力衰退，而是因为环境的改变，元代的崇尚武力，明代的八股取士等等。同时生产情况也一直留滞在封建社会阶段，而欧洲却继文艺复兴之后，转入了资本主义社会，因之他们的数学突飞猛进了，造成了目前的显著的差别！
    但这差别是暂时的！而不是基本性质的！
    注释这几句话是并不困难的。在古代时候，我们进入文明阶段为早（指恩格斯所说的文明阶段），所以我们的数学发展开始得比欧洲为早。在欧洲蒙混时期，我们已有显著的贡献。我们不妨为我们先民的伟大成就而感到光荣和鼓舞，但我们不可引以自满，而产生唯我独尊的优越感。后来欧洲资本主义的崛兴（当时这种制度也有他的进步性），催促了数学进一步的发展，而我们反而暂时显得落后。所以我们也不必要为了这落后现象而自馁地认为凡事不如人，而产生自卑感。今日如果把资本主义社会来和新民主主义社会、社会主义及共产主义社会相比较，则优劣之间又差了一个时代。所以我敢断言：在不久的将来，在毛主席所预示的文化新高潮到来的一天，我们的数学——实则整个的科学，整个的文化，都将突飞猛进，在世界上占一特别重要的地位。苏联的近况，就足以证实这一点！（附图片）
