　　A US Official Stationed in Japan Reveals
　  The US Plot to Arm Japan
　  Dulles and Yoshida Reportedly Discussed Establishing Japanese Army and Restoring War Industry
    Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 21st: According to the Dentsu News Agency, Truman's special envoy Dulles, in his recent meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida in Tokyo, not only discussed the peace treaty with Japan, but also discussed the establishment of a Japanese army, the construction of war industries, and Japan's new military obligations in Asia. The content of these unpublicized Dulles-Yoshida talks was revealed to a Dentsu reporter by an American official in a position of authority in Japan. This person recently came to Manila. He said: Dulles told Yoshida that the United States, "loyal to its old friendship with Japan," considers Japan to be their most important ally in the Far East. According to Dulles, a separate peace treaty to be concluded with Japan would enable Japan to accept a considerable portion of the "responsibility for maintaining order in the Far East and Southeast Asia." Dulles said this included Indochina, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Dulles, on behalf of the United States government, thanked Japan for the assistance it had provided in Korea, saying that Japan was already qualified to participate more actively in the "United Nations police action" in the Far East, mainly in Korea.
    Regarding the revival of Japanese militarism, Dulles told Yoshida that the American draft peace treaty would give Japan the power to establish strong armed forces. Dulles told Yoshida about the US State Department's recommendations on the issue of rearming Japan, as well as similar recommendations from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The content of these recommendations is: at the beginning stage of establishing the Japanese army, the Japanese army must initially be regarded as part of the "United Nations forces" responsible for "Far East defense." A prerequisite is to use the "police reserve force" as the core of future ground forces. At the same time, this force must be supplied with young officers.
    Dulles made it clear to Yoshida that, in addition to measures to recruit soldiers for the new army, the Japanese government must resume as soon as possible the operation of former arsenals capable of supplying the army with the necessary weapons and ammunition, tanks, armored vehicles, light and heavy artillery.
    Aircraft factories are now preparing to manufacture aircraft under American instructions. Shipyards will turn to manufacturing landing craft and auxiliary vessels.
    At the end of the meeting, Dulles expressed his hope that, following the recent meeting in Washington between representatives of the US government and Japanese Bank President Iwanada, concrete agreements could be reached on American financial assistance to enable Japan to carry out military measures and ensure the supply of raw materials for Japan's war industry.

　　驻日美国官员透露
　  美武装日本阴谋内容
　  杜勒斯与吉田曾讨论建立日本陆军及恢复战争工业等问题
    【新华社讯】据电通社马尼拉二十一日讯：杜鲁门的特使杜勒斯不久前在东京与日本首相吉田举行的各次会谈，不仅讨论了对日和约，而且还讨论了建立日本陆军、建设战争工业以及日本在亚洲的新军事义务的问题。这些未曾公布过的杜勒斯、吉田会谈的内容，是一个在日本身居权威地位的美国官员向电通社记者透露的。这个人最近来到马尼拉。他说：杜勒斯告诉吉田说：“忠实于旧时与日本的友谊的”美国，认为日本是他们在远东的最重要的盟友。据杜勒斯的意见，行将与日本缔结的单独和约，能使日本接受相当一部分“维持远东与东南亚的秩序的责任”。杜勒斯说，这包括印度支那、菲律宾与印尼。杜勒斯曾代表美国政府感谢日本在朝鲜所给予的帮助，他说：日本已经有资格更积极地在远东主要是朝鲜参加“联合国警察行动”。
    在恢复日本军国主义方面，杜勒斯对吉田说：美国的和约草案将给日本建立强大的武装部队的权力。杜勒斯把美国国务院对重新武装日本问题的建议以及参谋长联席会议的类似建议告诉了吉田。这些建议的内容是：在建立日本军队的开始阶段，起初必须把日本军队看做担任“远东防御”的“联合国军队”的一部分。一个先决条件是：利用“警察后备队”作为未来的地面部队的核心，同时，必须供给这个部队年青的军官。
    杜勒斯明白对吉田说：除了进行为新军召募兵员的措施以外，日本政府必须尽速恢复能够以必需的武器和军火、坦克、装甲车、轻炮和重炮供给军队的以前的兵工厂，使之重新开工。
    飞机厂现在正在美国指示下准备制造飞机。造船厂将转而制造登陆艇和辅助船只。
    杜勒斯在会谈结束时表示，希望在美国政府代表和日本银行总裁一万田最近在华盛顿举行的会议以后，能够在美国的财政援助方面获致具体的协议，以便使日本能够进行军事措施，同时，使日本战争工业的原料供应得到保证。
