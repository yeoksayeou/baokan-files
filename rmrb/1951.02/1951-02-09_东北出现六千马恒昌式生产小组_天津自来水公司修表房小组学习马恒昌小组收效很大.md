Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 2nd:  Northeast China is actively promoting the advanced experiences of the Ma Hengchang team. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions at the end of last year, 6,536 advanced Ma Hengchang-style production teams have emerged throughout Northeast China.  These teams, in learning from the Ma Hengchang team's experience, have all created outstanding production achievements, setting an example for the broad masses of workers. The Liu Lifu team of the Dalian Shipyard Railway Factory, since learning the Ma Hengchang team's experiences such as the three-person mutual aid group, inspection of the first task, and technical learning meetings, has improved its skills. Last year, it exceeded its monthly target by an average of 43% and has not produced any defective products, earning the glorious title of "Inspection-Exempt Team." The Zhang Wenhan tunneling team in Anshan changed its operating methods and increased production. In October, it exceeded its target by 47%, and in November, it exceeded it by 129%. It completed its entire year's production task in October. The Zhang Jiyun team of the Harbin No. 2 Garment Factory frequently held technical research meetings, carefully studied, and created a new marking method, saving 100,430 square feet of cloth, 196,900 feet of thread, and 110 man-hours in two batches of work. The Cui Guangxuan team of the Nenjiang Match Factory in Heilongjiang established a shift handover system, strengthened unity among workers, and improved technology. In the first quarter, they only exceeded the quota by 76 boxes, but in the second quarter, they exceeded it by 266 boxes. Liu Jinliang, a national labor model from the Fushun Power Plant, after learning from the Ma Hengchang team's experience, used his learning achievements to lead 42 shifts, making them all Ma Hengchang-style model shifts, creating a new record of two months without accidents. The coal consumption rate dropped from 0.95 tons stipulated by the Northeast Electric Power Administration to 0.842 tons.

The advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team was quickly promoted throughout Northeast China, thanks to the trade union organizations' attention and conscientious leadership. Since the advanced working methods of the Ma Hengchang team were discovered, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions summarized its experience and instructed its subordinate trade unions at all levels to vigorously promote it in April last year. At the end of July, it convened the first representative meeting of Ma Hengchang-style teams, promptly exchanging experiences in promotion and learning from various regions. All regions and industrial trade unions in Northeast China attached great importance to the promotion of this experience. For example, the Fuxin Coal Mine Federation of Trade Unions and the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions also successively convened representative meetings of advanced Ma Hengchang-style teams in their respective industries and regions.

[Report from This Newspaper] The Tianjin Water Company Repair Shop team achieved great results in learning from the Ma Hengchang team's experience because it was methodical and combined it with the characteristics of the team. The team began learning from the Ma Hengchang team's experience during the "Red May" production competition last year.  In the past nine months, it has completed its production tasks ahead of schedule every month. Compared with April last year, the average monthly output has increased by one and a half times, the meter stoppage rate has dropped from 10% to 0.8%, and the production cost has been reduced by 7%. The team has now won the glorious title of Model Team of the city.

The workers in the repair shop originally belonged to three units: the municipal water plant and the private Ji'an water plant. After the merger, they were still divided into three teams according to their original affiliations. Due to the different production conditions of the original units, the workers' production skills and experience were also different. Workers at the municipal water plant were more skilled in repairing Carter-style water meters, but the quality was not high; workers at the Ji'an water plant were more accurate in repairing Siemens-style water meters, but the output was very low. The former had preliminary experience in carrying out production competitions, while the latter had never engaged in competitions.  Usually, the three teams did their own thing, and there was little contact between them. When the "Red May" competition began last year, the team workers felt that they would not be able to carry out the competition well if they continued doing things separately.  Upon the recommendation of the trade union deputy director to the administration, the original three teams were dismantled, mixed, and reorganized into two teams.  Under the slogan of "breaking the old concept of 'keeping to oneself'," they first learned the Ma Hengchang team's spirit of unity and overcame technical conservatism.  Thus, they learned from each other and improved together, and production efficiency and product quality also improved.

After the team and individual competition plans were drawn up, the team further learned from the Ma Hengchang team's experience in establishing production progress charts.  Every day, the team leader used loose-leaf paper to record the number of meters repaired by each worker and the quality of the work, and these records were posted on the blackboard newspaper. This method greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for competition. In June, the team also learned from the Ma Hengchang team's experience of production review meetings and established a weekend team meeting system to check the difficulties and shortcomings that occurred in production and study improvement methods.  These team review meetings were very effective. For example, in the first week of July, the team's rework rate increased to one-fourth of the week's output. The team leader raised this issue at the meeting. After review, the main reason was found to be water leakage from the leather money wheels. Xu Qingshan, an experienced technical worker, came up with a method of polishing the leather money wheels with glass powder, which overcame the leakage phenomenon. In the second week, the rework rate was reduced by two-thirds.

At the beginning of August last year, the administration proposed improving quality as the focus of the competition. The repair shop team immediately convened a meeting to discuss how to reduce the meter stoppage rate. According to the characteristics that workers in the team had their own strengths in repairing Carter-style water meters or Siemens-style water meters, it was decided to learn from the Ma Hengchang team's experience of technical mutual assistance. At the beginning, team leader Mu Chengen and worker Yang Xueli first implemented mutual assistance to set an example, and then set up technical mutual aid groups of three or four people. Yang Xueli was an amateur in repairing Siemens-style water meters. It took him almost half a workday to repair one meter. After Mu Chengen helped him change the operating method, his work efficiency doubled. By December, the technical mutual aid group of four people was formally established and learned the "making-a-set" method similar to the assembly line method of the Ma Hengchang team. One water meter was divided into four parts: the outer casing, the water plug, etc., and each person was responsible for repairing one part, which further improved production efficiency. At the same time, the mutual aid group also learned from the Ma Hengchang team's experience and established a finished product inspection system. Before the finished product was handed over to the inspection department, it was first inspected within the group. If it did not meet the standards, it would be repaired immediately, which relatively reduced the phenomenon of rework. The Yang Xueli mutual aid group of the team strictly implemented the inspection system and has not produced a single piece of rework for several consecutive months.

In order to improve technology, the team learned from the Ma Hengchang team's experience and established a technical research meeting during the lunch break. In addition to studying the key points of the work to be done that day, pointing out where problems were likely to occur, and what needed attention, the meeting also solved technical difficulties raised by individuals. Through the technical research meeting, the team has put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals in recent months, of which 16 have been adopted and implemented effectively.

Due to the effectiveness of learning from the Ma Hengchang team's experience, the sense of responsibility of each worker in the team has been greatly improved, and the production responsibility system has a foundation. As of January this year, the team further learned another experience of the Ma Hengchang team and established a division of labor and responsibility system for the storage, cleaning, and maintenance of machines and tools, and formulated 15 labor covenants, including not being late, not leaving early, cherishing tools, and humbly accepting criticism.

　　东北出现六千马恒昌式生产小组        
    天津自来水公司修表房小组学习马恒昌小组收效很大
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北各地积极推广马恒昌小组先进经验，据东北总工会去年年底的不完全统计，全东北已出现六千五百三十六个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。这些小组在学习马恒昌小组经验中，都创造了优异的生产成绩，给广大工人群众作出了榜样。旅大船坞铁路工厂刘立富小组，自从学习了马恒昌小组的三人互助组，检查头一个活，开技术学习会等经验，提高了技术，去年平均每月都超过任务百分之四十三，还没出过废品，荣获“免检小组”的光荣称号。鞍山张文翰掘进小组，改变操作法，提高了产量，十月份超过任务百分之四十七，十一月份超过百分之一百二十九，十月份就完成了全年的生产任务。哈尔滨市第二被服厂张继云小组，经常召开技术研究会，精心钻研，创出新的划样法，两批活节省了十万零四千三百方尺布，十九万六千九百尺线，一百一十个人工。黑龙江嫩江火柴厂崔广轩组建立了交接班制度，加强了工人之间的团结，提高了技术，第一季度他们只超额七十六箱，第二季度就超额了二百六十六箱。抚顺发电厂全国劳动模范刘金良学习马恒昌小组经验后，又以自己学习所得的成绩带动了四十二个班，使他们都成了马恒昌式的模范班，创出了两个月无事故的新纪录，燃煤率由东北电业总局规定的○·九五吨降到○·八四二吨。
    马恒昌小组的先进经验很快地就推广到东北各地，这是工会组织重视并认真领导的结果。自从马恒昌小组的先进工作方法被发现后，东北总工会即总结其经验，并于去年四月指示所属各级工会大力推广，七月末又召集了第一届马恒昌式小组代表会议，及时交流了各地推广学习的经验。东北各地区和产业工会都十分重视这个经验的推广。如阜新煤矿总工会、黑龙江省总工会等也先后召开了该产业及该地区的马恒昌式先进小组代表会议。
    【本报讯】天津市自来水公司修表房小组学习马恒昌小组经验，有步骤又能结合本组特点，所以收效很大。该组于去年红五月开展生产竞赛时，开始学习马恒昌小组经验，九个月来每月都提前完成生产任务，与去年四月份比较，平均每月增加产量一倍半，停表率由百分之十降至百分之零点八，生产成本减低百分之七。该组现已获得全市模范小组的光荣称号。
    修表房的工人原来分属市营水厂及私营济安水厂等三个单位，合并后仍按原属分编为三个小组。由于原来各单位生产情况不同，工人的生产技术和经验也不一样。市营水厂工人修理卡特式水表比较熟练，但质量不高；济安水厂工人修理西门子式水表比较精确，而产量却很低。前者对开展生产竞赛已有初步经验，后者却从来没有搞过竞赛。平日三组各做各的，联系不密切。当去年红五月竞赛开始时，该组工人即感到，像这样各是各的，是不会把竞赛搞好的。经工会副主任向行政方面建议，将原来三个小组拆散，混和起来改成两个小组，在“打破井水不犯河水旧观念”的口号下，首先学习马恒昌小组的团结精神，克服技术上的互相保守。于是彼此互相学习，互相提高，生产效率和产品质量也就随之提高起来。
    当小组与个人的竞赛计划订出后，该组就进一步学习马恒昌小组建立生产进度表的经验，每天由小组长用活页纸将每个工人的修表件数与质量好坏记录下来，并把这些记录在黑板报上公布出来。这个办法大大鼓励了工人们的竞赛热情。六月间，该组又学习马恒昌小组生产检讨会的经验，建立了周末小组会议制度，以检查生产中发生的困难与缺点，并研究改进办法。这样的小组检讨会很有成效，例如七月份第一周，该组返工活增达全周产量的四分之一，小组长在会上提出，经过检讨，找出主要原因是皮钱轮漏水。老技术工人许清山就想办法用玻璃粉磨皮钱轮，克服了漏水现象。第二周返工活就减少了三分之二。
    去年八月初，行政方面提出改进质量为竞赛重点，修表房小组立即召开会议，讨论如何降低停表率。根据组内工人修理卡特式水表或西门子式水表各有特长的特点，便决定学习马恒昌小组技术互助的经验。开始时，先由小组长穆承恩和工人杨学礼两个人实行互助，作个榜样，随后再成立三人或四人的技术互助组。杨学礼修西门子式水表是个外行，每修一只表几乎要用去半个工作日，经穆承恩帮助改变操作方法后，工作效率就提高了一倍。到十二月份，四人一组的技术互助组正式成立，并学习了马恒昌小组类似流水作业法的“做套子活”办法，将一支水表分为表皮、水塞等四个部分，每人负责修理一部，生产效率又提高了一步。同时，互助组还学习马恒昌小组经验建立了成品检验制度，当成品交检验科前，先在组内检验一下，如不合规格就立刻再修，这就相对地减少了返工现象。该组杨学礼互助组即因检验制度执行严格，连续数月未出一件返工活。
    为了改进技术，该组学习马恒昌小组经验，建立了中午休息时间的技术研究会，在会上除了研究当天要作的活的要点，指出什么地方容易出毛病，需要注意外，还解决个人所提技术上的困难问题。通过技术研究会，该组数月来提出的合理化建议有二十余件，其中十六件被采纳实行有效。
    由于学习马恒昌小组经验有成效，该组每个工人的负责精神大为提高，生产责任制已有了基础。至今年一月，该组即进一步学习马恒昌小组的另一经验，建立了机器工具保管、擦洗的分工负责制度，并订出十五条劳动公约，包括不迟到、不早退、爱护工具、虚心接受批评等内容。
