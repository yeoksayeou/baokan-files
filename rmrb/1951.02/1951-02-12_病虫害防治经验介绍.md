　　Introduction to Experiences in Preventing and Controlling Plant Diseases and Insect Pests
　　Editor's Note: The prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests is one of the focal points of discussion at this North China Agricultural Technology Conference. According to surveys, last year in North China, the grain lost due to plant diseases and insect pests was nearly one-tenth of the total harvest. This illustrates the importance of the struggle against natural disasters in old revolutionary base areas after the elimination of the feudal system of exploitation. At this conference, a consensus was reached on the principle of "prevention is better than cure" for the issue of plant disease and insect pest control, and typical experiences from various regions were exchanged. What is published here is a part of these typical experiences.
            Seed Disinfection Work in Chahar
　　In 1950, Chahar Province universally launched a seed disinfection campaign. According to survey results, over 4.88 million mu province-wide underwent seed soaking and seed mixing, with an estimated increase in grain production of over 50 million jin. The planting area of disinfected seeds accounted for 40% of the total planting area of crops such as wheat, naked oats, millet, and sorghum in the province. The number of households using soaking and mixing accounted for 60% of the total number of households in the province.
　　I. Specific Situation of Disinfection Work
　　Seed Soaking: Cai Zhuangzi in Longguan County, Charnan Prefecture, planted 700 mu of naked oats. The annual disease incidence rate was 10% to 30%. In 1949, the disease incidence rate was 30% to 40%. In 1950, the entire village universally used warm water for seed soaking. Except for individual households who had concerns and did not soak the seeds at the standard temperature, the disease incidence rate was still 2% to 10%. Generally, the number of diseased ears of naked oats in households was extremely low, averaging a reduction of over 90% in diseased ears compared to last year, and the village increased its production of naked oats by 224 shi. In Ma Tiao Village, Shuoxian County, Yanbei, out of 214 mu of naked oats, 196 mu were soaked, with diseased ears accounting for less than 1%. For example, farmer Tian Rang's wheat did not develop a single black smut after soaking. In the same plot of land, his brother's wheat developed more than half black smut because it was not soaked.
　　Ceresan Seed Mixing: According to an inspection in Shangdu County, Chabei, Donghuofang Village used 161 jin of Ceresan to mix seeds, planting 4,125 mu of wheat and 1,300 mu of naked oats, and not a single black smut ear occurred. Tianjia Village used Ceresan to mix naked oats seeds, and the disease incidence rate was only 1%, while the unmixed seeds had a disease incidence rate of 20%. In Mantouying, Zhangbei County, Jinxi planted 6 mu of naked oats, using Ceresan to mix seeds for 5 mu, and not a single black smut ear grew; in the other mu without mixing, there were more than 20 black smut ears per hundred plants. In Jiangjia Village, Shangdu, Tang Jin's wheat was mixed with Ceresan, and no black smut ears occurred. His wife stopped him from mixing the naked oats seeds, resulting in a 30% incidence of black smut and a 30% reduction in yield. Later, the couple had a big fight over this. Tunken Team Village also used Ceresan to mix seeds, but because the mixing was uneven, there was still a 2.2% incidence of black smut ears. The average incidence of diseased ears for other unmixed seeds was 21.8%.
　　Liquor Seed Mixing: In Donghuofang, Shangdu, Chabei, 6 to 7.5 liang of 70-proof diluted alcohol was used to mix one da dou of naked oats (the standard should be 9 liang). Seeds mixed well were used to plant 2,600 mu of naked oats, and diseased ears were extremely rare. In Mantouying, Zhangbei County, it was found that the disease incidence rate was 2.5% when 4 liang of diluted alcohol was mixed per da dou of naked oats, 0.7% when 8 liang was mixed, and 0.31% when 9 liang was mixed. There were also cases of mixing 3 liang of liquor, with a disease incidence rate of 10%. In Wucun, Hunyuan County, Yanbei, Wang Jinkui mixed 4 liang of liquor per da dou of naked oats, and the disease incidence rate was 13.8%.
　　Based on the above situation and the feedback from the masses, Ceresan seed mixing is the best. All cases that followed the prescribed amount and were mixed evenly were 100% effective. The next best is warm water seed soaking, which is also 100% effective as long as the temperature and time are accurately controlled, but most people find it difficult to master. According to a survey by Hunyuan Farm, the maximum incidence of diseased ears for soaked seeds was 5%. Diluted 70-proof alcohol can also completely eliminate black smut disease if 9 liang is used per da dou of seeds, but the masses are accustomed to using ordinary liquor (55-proof or even less than 50-proof), and only use 4 to 6 liang per da dou of seeds, resulting in a disease incidence of over 10%. If 9 liang of liquor is used for seed mixing, there are concerns about damaging germination, and liquor is more expensive than Ceresan. Therefore, this year the masses have generally recognized that Ceresan is more effective, cheaper, and easier to use. It is estimated that at least 80,000 jin of Ceresan can be promoted next year.
　　II. Several Key Factors in the Development of Work
　　(1) The completion of land reform throughout the province and the issuance of land certificates have ensured the property rights of the working people, thereby greatly increasing the enthusiasm of farmers for production. There is an urgent need for new production technologies. For example, an old fellow in Baojia Village, Xuanhua, pulled a donkey to the Shalingzi Farm to ask technical cadres, which illustrates the masses' urgent need to improve technology.
　　(2) The leadership clearly proposed that seed soaking and mixing is the primary task in spring planting and promptly carried out publicity and education work. For example, in the winter of 1949, technology was listed as one of the main courses in the training classes for cadres of industry and commerce in counties and districts. Subsequently, at the Provincial Party Representative Conference, the Provincial Production Conference, the Labor Model Conference, people's representative conferences at all levels, and other relevant departmental meetings, detailed explanations and practical experiments were conducted, emphasizing that leading cadres must first learn the technology. In particular, before spring planting, most counties, districts, and villages conducted arrangements and discussions through people's representative conferences, youth representative conferences, women's representative conferences, and teacher conferences, and generally conducted germination tests to dispel the masses' concerns about burning the seeds. Most villages, led by elementary school teachers, organized wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasts, and used technical courses as the teaching content of civil schools and elementary schools at that time to mobilize students to persuade their parents to thoroughly implement the technology of seed soaking and mixing among the masses.
　　(3) Establishment of a unified technical promotion organization. In the spring of 1950, the promotion teams of various farms were transferred to the province and expanded to form the Agricultural and Forestry Technology Promotion Team. During the spring planting period, they assisted various counties in conducting typical demonstrations in key districts and villages, and specifically taught and guided the soaking and mixing techniques. Many villages and villages in the province established village technical groups to supervise and promote the soaking and mixing work of the entire village.
　　(4) The province, prefectures, and counties all dispatched a large number of cadres to form inspection teams, which went deep into the countryside to assist local work and promptly solve problems. For example, before planting wheat in Shanyin County, the county and district leaders were only satisfied with the transmission, deployment, and germination experiments at the people's representative conference. The village cadres and the masses thought, "Let's give it a try this year," so the organizational leadership work did not keep up, resulting in very little wheat seed soaking. After the inspection team arrived, they coordinated with county and district cadres, took charge of areas by small area, and personally helped the masses soak and mix seeds, so the seed disinfection campaign for autumn crops was immediately fully launched. In terms of approach, Party members, League members, activists, and labor models were used as the backbone, and their active leadership and guarantee role promoted the broad masses.
　　(5) The Provincial Department of Agriculture prepared sufficient Ceresan, alcohol, thermometers, and closely cooperated with supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to fully supply the needs of the masses.
　　III. Deviations and Shortcomings That Occurred
　　Without considering the actual situation of the masses, an excessively high demand was put forward to complete 100% soaking and mixing of major crops. Coupled with the simple task-oriented view of some county, district, and village cadres, forced orders occurred in some areas. For example, some villages in Huailai and Yanqing counties in Charnan Prefecture proposed that if seeds were not soaked and mixed, planting would not be allowed, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some village militia members even stood guard at village entrances, preventing people from leaving the village if seeds were not soaked and mixed. Secondly, the technology was not unified, such as inconsistent soaking times and temperatures, leaving subordinates at a loss. The Chabei Supply and Marketing Cooperative changed the price of pesticides three times, confusing the masses and making them unwilling to buy. In addition, some cadres did not learn the technology and used half-baked explanations such as "probably" or "maybe" when publicizing to the masses, because he himself was confused, so he confused the masses as well. Some cadres, although they had learned the technology, were still not sure about its effectiveness. For example, when a cadre in the Ninth District of Shuoxian County was soaking seeds for a farmer, the farmer asked him, "Comrade, what if the seeds are scalded to death?" Because he could not answer, he never dared to ask about seed soaking work again.
            Zhoujiazhuang's Campaign to Eliminate Fire Dragon (Red Spider) in Jinxian County
　　Zhoujiazhuang is a village in the Fifth District of Jinxian County, Hebei Province, with over 400 households, over 2,000 people, and over 7,000 mu of cultivated land, of which cotton fields account for over 5,000 mu.
　　Last July, just as the masses in Jinxian County had finished controlling aphids, fire dragon (red spider) suddenly broke out. At that time, the masses were busy watering millet and turning sweet potato vines, and did not pay attention to prevention and control, so the entire cotton field spread. At that time, Zhoujiazhuang occurred the earliest and was also the most serious, and 40% of the village's cotton fields began to be harmed. At this time, the farm work team promoted the use of paste water to control it, but it encountered continuous cloudy and rainy days and failed to take effect, causing the masses to lose confidence and unanimously believe that it could not be cured.
　　Under this serious situation, cadres at all levels in the county organized a large number of people to quickly invest in this emergency work. The county party secretary personally went to the countryside to inspect and promote it, calling on the masses to use lime sulfur mixture. First, a typical demonstration was made in Cao Tongyi's field at the east entrance of the village, with an effect of over 90%. Immediately afterwards, a technical group meeting was convened to explain the preparation method of sulfur lime water. Medicine was boiled on the spot to learn the technology. Each of the 17 members of the group was assigned a portion of the medicine water and conducted on-site experiments separately. The insecticidal results were all around 80% to 90%. The members of the technical group vigorously carried out publicity and mobilization, and used 2 mu of cotton fields for demonstration, with an effect of 100%. At this time, an enlarged cadre meeting of the village administration was convened, and the slogan "One household not treating, hundreds of households suffer" was put forward. At that time, the 60 sprayers brought by the work team were not enough, and the masses created collective medicine boiling. In 14 days, a total of 420 jin of sulfur was used to control 936 mu of cotton fields. Eight hundred people in the village mastered the technology of controlling fire dragon. In this way, the entire county adopted the sulfur lime water control method, so that the fire dragon did not cause a major disaster.
　　Several Experiences in the Campaign
　　1. Collective Medicine Preparation: It is a good method to concentrate the sulfur lime of each household and use large pots to boil it.
　　2. Exclusive Sale of Prepared Medicine: District and county cadres master a large amount of preparation for the masses to use. In Dongsili Village in the Third District, medicine water was boiled, costs were calculated, and sold to the masses for use. The advantages of these methods are as follows:
　　(1) Save manpower, furniture and fuel.
　　(2) People with more skilled techniques master the medicine preparation, with less deviation and consistent efficacy.
　　(3) Help the elderly, weak, orphans, widows, and the villagers who can't prepare medicine.
　　(4) Expand influence and impart technology.
　　3. Sulfur Lime Water Preparation Standard: The color should be used as the standard for boiling, not time. The best time is when it boils, the water bubbles turn green, and the juice is reddish-brown.
　　4. Dosage: When the cotton is two to three feet high, two people with a sprayer can treat two to three mu per day, and each mu needs 300 to 400 jin of medicine water.
　　5. Mixing Ratio: Two jin of ordinary sulfur, half a jin of quicklime, and eight jin of clean water are boiled into the original solution, which is best diluted with 600 jin of water.
　　General Laws of Fire Dragon Occurrence
　　1. Fire dragons occur more severely in cotton fields close to bean fields.
　　2. Healthy cotton seedlings are less harmful, while weak ones are more harmful.
　　3. Cotton in white soil and yellow sand land is more severe, while black sticky soil is lighter.
            Introducing Several Experimentally Effective Control Methods
　　Cotton Red Spider Control Method:
　　In Zhoujiazhuang, Jinxian County, Hebei Province, the Hebei Provincial Farm called for the use of lime sulfur mixture to control red spiders very successfully. Mixing ratio: one jin of sulfur, half a jin of quicklime, and eight jin of clean water are boiled into the original solution, which is diluted with 600 jin of water. The application rate per mu is 300 to 400 jin.
　　Wheat Red Spider Control Method:
　　I. Chemical control is best with tobacco leaf water and white flour paste water. II. Mechanical control is better with insect removal vehicles and using hoes to push them. III. Coating the wooden board with paste or vegetable oil to stick to them has a 90% effect. IV. Adding one jin of salt to every hundred jin of white flour paste water, the effect reaches 95%. Also, Juye County, Pingyuan Province, uses three-pronged wooden forks to tie a dustpan and push it along the wheat ridge, which is very effective.
　　Flying Locust Capture and Beating Method: In Hualin Village, Zanhuang, Hebei Province, the method of using light to lure and capturing and beating at dawn to eliminate flying locusts is adopted: I. Light Luring Method: Flying locusts are not easy to capture and beat during the day, so it is better to do it at night. Cut a piece of reeds (if there are flying locusts in the reed field), two zhang long and wide, sprinkle wheat straw on it, hang a gasoline lamp high at night, and the surrounding masses drive and beat the locusts to gather on the wheat straw and set it on fire. However, this method is only effective when the temperature is high at night. II. Dawn Capture and Beat Method: In the early morning, the locust wings have dew, and the jumping is sluggish. The surrounding masses start catching and beating at the same time, which can eliminate them.
　　Control of Millet Borer: According to the experimental results of the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, cutting off from the fourth section or above before the millet is tasselled in July has no impact on the millet harvest, because the borers are mostly hidden in the sixth section, and occasionally in the fifth section. According to the experiment of Changzhi Farm, the damaged millet can still grow, tassel, and form full grains after being cut off below one chi (from the root to the leaf heart). In areas where millet borers (heart borers) are harmful, it can be tried and promoted.
　　Control of Rice Leaf Roller:
　　1. Control Method during the Pre-Pregnancy Ear Period: A. Shaking Method: In the morning or evening, use a thick rope. Two people hold one end each and shake back and forth over the rice, causing the rice leaf roller to fall into the water and drown. This method is very effective when the larvae are not grown up. If some kerosene is dripped on the water surface, the effect will be better. However, the water should be changed immediately afterwards to avoid drug damage. B. Wooden Board Beating Method: Use two pieces of wooden board to beat the bract leaves together, killing the larvae pupae hiding in the bract. It is also very effective. Or you can nail two old shoe soles with two wooden handles and hold one in each hand to beat each other along the ridge.
　　2. Control Method during the Tasseling Period: Picking Borer (also known as combing borer): Use an iron fork (manure fork) to pick open the glued rice leaves, letting the rice borer fall into the water and drown. This method is more appropriate during the pupation period.
　　3. Control Method after Tasseling: Picking Method: Use a cloth bag or bamboo basket to pick and put it into the bag or basket immediately, and take it home, which can be used as chicken feed.
　　Cricket Control Method: 1. Use sodium fluosilicate at a ratio of one to twenty-five with mung bean sprouts as poisonous bait to kill mole crickets and crickets, with an effect of 95%. The killing power of poisonous bait made with the same amount of wheat bran and sodium fluosilicate is 80%. 2. Sweep the ground flat in advance, and people drive from all around to the inside, walk slowly, and move hands quickly. Put some firewood in the middle, and burn it with fire after the crickets run in. The effect is significant and easily accepted by the masses.

　　病虫害防治经验介绍
    编者按：植物病虫害防治问题，为本次华北农业技术会议的讨论重点之一。据调查，去年华北各地，因病虫为害而损失的粮食，几达总收获量的十分之一。这说明了老区农村在消灭了封建剥削制度以后，向自然灾害进行斗争的重要性。这次大会对病虫害防治问题，一致通过了防重于治的方针，并交换了各地的典型经验。这里发表的就是这些典型经验的一部分。
            察哈尔的种子消毒工作
    一九五○年，察哈尔省普遍开展了种子消毒运动。据调查结果，全省共有四百八十八万余亩，进行了浸种和拌种，估计增产粮食五千余万斤。消毒种子的播种面积，占全省小麦、莜麦、谷子、高粱等作物播种面积的百分之四十。浸拌种户数，占全省总户数百分之六十。
    一、消毒工作的具体情况
    浸种：察南专区龙关县蔡庄子，种莜麦七百亩，常年发病率在百分之十至三十，一九四九年发病率为百分之三十至四十，一九五○年全村普遍用温汤浸种，除个别户思想有顾虑没按标准温度浸种，发病率仍为百分之二至十外，一般户的莜麦发生病穗极少，平均比去年减少病穗百分之九十以上，全村增产莜麦二百二十四石。雁北朔县马跳庄二百一十四亩莜麦，浸种的一百九十六亩，病穗不到百分之一：如农民田让的麦子，浸种后未发生一棵黑穗，在同样一块地里，他哥哥的麦子因未浸种而发生了一半以上的黑穗。
    赛力散拌种：据察北商都县检查，东伙房村用赛力散一百六十一斤拌种，播种小麦四千一百二十五亩，莜麦一千三百亩，一枝黑穗都未发生。田家村用赛力散拌莜麦，发病率仅为百分之一，而不拌种的发病率为百分之二十。张北县馒头营金喜种六亩莜麦，用赛力散拌种，种了五亩，一棵黑穗未生；另一亩未拌种，在百棵中有二十多棵黑穗。商都蒋家村唐金的小麦用赛力散拌了种，一棵黑穗没发生，莜麦被他的妻子阻挡没进行拌种，发生了百分之三十的黑穗，减产三成。后来，两夫妻为此大吵一场。屯垦队村也是用赛力散拌种，因拌的不匀，仍有百分之二点二的黑穗发生，其他未拌种的发生病穗平均为百分之二十一点八。
    酒拌种：察北商都东伙房用七十度稀释酒精六两至七两五，拌一大斗莜麦（按标准应为九两），有拌好的种子共种莜麦二千六百亩，病穗极少。又在张北县馒头营检查，每大斗莜麦拌四两稀释酒精的发病率为百分之二点五，拌八两的发病率为百分之零点七，拌九两的发病率为百分之零点三一，还有拌三两烧酒的，发病率为百分之十。雁北浑源县武村王靳奎每大斗莜麦拌四两烧酒，发病率为百分之十三点八。
    根据以上情况与各地群众反映，以赛力散拌种为最好，凡按照规定数量且又搅拌均匀的，都是百分之百的有效；其次是温汤浸种，只要准确的掌握了温度与时间，也是百分之百的有效力，不过大多数人不易掌握好。据浑源农场调查，浸过种的，最多发生病穗百分之五，七十度稀释酒精如每大斗种子用九两也能全部把黑穗病消灭，但群众习惯用普通烧酒（五十五度以下甚至有的不到五十度），每大斗种子只用四两到六两，则仍发生病穗百分之十以上，如用九两酒拌种，则有顾虑，怕伤害发芽，且烧酒价格较赛力散贵，故今年群众已公认赛力散效力大又便宜，使用也省事。估计明年至少可推广赛力散八万斤左右。
    二、工作展开的几个关键
    （一）全省土改完成，土地证已经颁发，确保了劳动人民的财权产权，因而农民生产情绪普遍高涨，迫切需要新的生产技术，如宣化保家庄老乡拉着毛驴到沙岭子农场请技术干部，这就是一个说明群众迫切需要改良技术的例子。
    （二）领导上明确提出了浸拌种是春播中的首要任务，并及时进行了宣传教育工作。如一九四九年冬季就开始在县区实业干部训练班上，把技术列为主要课程之一，随后在省党代表会、省生产会议、劳模会、各级人民代表会，以及其他有关部门的会议上，都作了详尽的讲解和实际的试验，强调领导干部首先要学会技术。特别是春播前大部县区村都通过了人民代表会议、青年代表会议、妇女代表会议、教员会，布置讨论，并普遍做了发芽试验，解除了群众怕烧坏种子的顾虑。大部村庄，以小学教员为主，组织墙报、黑板报、屋顶广播，并以技术课程作为民校及小学校当时的教学内容，动员学生说服家长，将浸种拌种的技术，深入的贯彻到群众中去。
    （三）建立统一的技术推广组织，一九五○年春将各农场的推广队调省，扩大成立了农林技术推广队，春播期间协助各县到重点区村进行典型示范，具体传授与指导了浸拌技术。全省不少庄村建立村技术小组，督导与推动了全村浸拌种工作。
    （四）省、专、县均抽出大量干部组成检查组，深入农村协助当地工作，发现问题及时解决。如山阴县播种小麦前，县区领导上只满足于人民代表会上的传达、布置、与发芽试验，村干部与群众思想上是“今年试试看”，因而组织领导工作没赶上去，致小麦浸种很少。检查组到达后，协同县区干部以小区为单位，分片负责，亲自下手帮助群众浸种拌种，因而大秋作物的种子消毒运动，立即全面开展。在进行方式上，采取了以党团员与积极分子及劳动模范为骨干，以其积极带头与保证作用推动了广大群众。
    （五）省农业厅事先准备了足够的赛力散、酒精、温度计，与各级供销合作社密切合作，充分供给了群众的需要。
    三、发生的偏向与缺点
    没有根据群众的实际情况，即提出完成主要作物百分之百浸拌种的过高要求，加以部分县区村干部的单纯任务观点，在某些地区发生了强迫命令的现象，如察南专区怀来、延庆等县部分村庄提出如不浸种拌种，不让播种。引起了群众不满。还有的村民兵在村口站岗，不浸种拌种不让出村。其次为技术上不统一，如浸种时间及温度，前后不一致，使下级无所适从。察北供销社推广农药，曾三次变更价格，使群众摸不着底，不愿购买。另外部分干部因没学会技术，向群众宣传时，用一知半解的“大概”或“可能”等解释方法，因为他自己糊涂，所以把群众也弄糊涂了。还有些干部虽然学会了技术，但思想上还不敢肯定其效果，如朔县九区干部给一户农民浸种时，农民问他：“同志：烫死了种子怎么办？”他因为答复不了，以后再也不敢过问浸种工作了。
            晋县周家庄除治火龙（红蜘蛛）运动
    周家庄是河北省晋县五区的一个村子，全村四百余户，二千余人口，耕地七千余亩，棉田占五千亩以上。
    去年七月，晋县群众把蚜虫刚刚打下去，又忽然发生了火龙（红蜘蛛）。这时群众正在忙于浇谷和翻甘薯蔓，未注意防治，因而全部棉田都蔓延开来。当时周家庄发生最早，而且也最严重，全村百分之四十的棉田开始受害。这时农场工作组，宣传用浆糊水去防治，但又遇连天阴雨，未能见效，使群众失去了信心，一致认为无法救治。
    在这种严重的情况下，全县各级干部组织了大批力量，迅速投入这一紧急工作，县委书记也亲自下乡检查推动，号召群众使用石灰硫磺合剂。首先在村东口曹同义地里作典型示范，效果达百分之九十以上。接着即召开技术小组会，讲解了硫磺石灰水的配制法，当场熬药，学习技术，十七名组员每人分了一部药水，分别进行实地试验，杀虫结果均在百分之八十至百分之九十左右，技术组员即大力进行宣传动员，又用二亩棉田作了示范，效果达百分之百。这时即召开了村行政扩大干部会议，提出“一家不治百家受害”的口号。当时工作组带的六十架喷雾器不够用，群众创造了集体熬药，十四天当中共用了四百二十斤硫磺，防治了九百三十六亩棉田，全村有八百人掌握了防治火龙的技术。这样一来，全县都采用了硫磺石灰水的防治法，使火龙没有酿成巨灾。
    运动中的几点经验
    １、集体配药：把各户的硫磺石灰集中在一起，利用大锅熬制，这个办法是好的。
    ２、专卖成药：由区县干部掌握大量配制，供群众应用。在三区东四里村，熬成药水，计算成本，卖给群众应用。这些方法的好处有以下几点：
    （１）节省人力家具和燃料。
    （２）技术较熟练的人掌握配药，少出偏差，效力一致。
    （３）帮助了老弱孤寡及不会配药的老乡。
    （４）扩大影响传授技术。
    ３、配制硫磺石灰水标准：熬时应以颜色为标准，不应以时间来计算。当沸腾起来，水泡发绿色，汁液呈赭褐色时为最好。
    ４、用药量：在棉花二三尺高时，两人一架喷雾器，一日可治二亩到三亩，每亩需用药水三百到四百斤。
    ５、配合量：以普通硫磺二斤、石灰半斤、清水八斤，熬成原液，对水六百斤，效力为最好。
    火龙发生的一般规律
    １、凡棉田靠近豆子地者，火龙发生就重。
    ２、棉苗健壮者为害较轻，弱者较重。
    ３、白土和黄沙土地的棉花较重，黑黏土地较轻。
            介绍几种试验有效的防治法
    棉花红蜘蛛防治法：
    在河北晋县周家庄，由河北省农场号召用石灰硫磺合剂防治红蜘蛛很成功。配合量：硫磺一斤，生石灰半斤，清水八斤，熬成原液，对水六百斤。每亩施用量三百至四百斤。
    小麦红蜘蛛防治法：
    一、药剂防治以烟叶水，白面浆糊水为佳。二、机械防治以除虫车，用锄头推较好。三、木板上涂浆糊或植物油粘着法效果有百分之九十。四、白面浆糊水每百斤加盐一斤，效力达到百分之九十五。又平原省巨野县用三股木杈缚着簸箕，沿麦垅推行，很有效。
    捕打飞蝗法：在河北省赞皇花林村，采用灯光诱杀和拂晓捕打法消灭飞蝗：一、灯光诱杀法：飞蝗白天不易捕打，夜晚为宜，把苇子割一片，（如苇地有飞蝗时）长宽二丈，撒上麦秸，晚上高悬汽灯，四周群众驱打，使蝗虫集在麦秸上放火烧掉。但此法须在晚上气温高时行之才有效。二、拂晓捕打法：在清晨蝗虫翅有露水，跳跃迟钝，四围群众一齐动手捕捉，即可消灭。
    粟螟虫的防治：据山西省农业试验场试验结果，在七月间谷子未抽穗前，由第四节以上剪去，对谷子收获无影响，因螟虫多藏在第六节，间有在第五节者，又据长治农场试验，被害谷如在高一尺以下者（由根至叶心）剪断后仍能生长抽穗结成饱满粒，在粟螟虫（钻心虫）为害地区，可以试行推广。
    除治稻苞虫：
    １、未孕穗期治法：甲、震动法：在早晨或晚上用一条较粗的绳子，两人各执一头，从稻上来回震动，使稻苞虫落在水中淹死，此法在幼虫未长大时，多作几次，效力很大，如在水面滴些煤油效力更好。但事后应即换水，以免药害。乙、木板拍杀法：用两片木板合拍苞叶，将躲藏在苞内的幼虫蛹压死，也很有效。或用两个旧鞋底子钉上两个木柄，双手各执一个，顺垅互相拍打也可。
    ２、抽穗期治法：挑苞虫（又名梳苞虫）：用铁叉（粪叉）把粘连的稻叶挑开，让稻苞虫掉落水中淹死，此法在化蛹期较为妥善。
    ３、抽穗后的治法：采摘法：用一布袋或竹篮随摘随即放入袋内或篮内，带回家去，可作鸡的饲料。
    蟋蟀的防治法：１、用氟矽酸钠一比二十五与绿豆芽作毒饵，诱杀蝼蛄及蟋蟀，效力在百分之九十五，用同量麦麸和氟矽酸钠制成的毒饵诱杀力为百分之八十。２、预先把地扫平，人从四周围向里赶，走的要慢，手的动作要快，中间放些柴草，待蟋蟀跑进去，用火烧掉，效力显著，群众易接受。
