　　The Governments of the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand
　  Differ on Opinion About Arming Japan
    Dulles' Activities Meet Opposition from Australian People
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch] War-monger Dulles arrived in the Philippines on the 11th from Tokyo. After two days of activities, he flew to Canberra on the 13th and began talks with the Australian and New Zealand governments.

    Dulles' main purpose in going to the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand was to coerce these three countries into complying with the U.S. policy of rearming Japan. As early as January 26, the spokesman for the Dulles mission in Washington revealed: "One of Dulles' most important missions on this trip is to convince Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines that they do not need to fear Japan's rearmament—a natural byproduct of the peace treaty with Japan." While Dulles was active in Japan, news came from various sources that these countries feared the United States' rearming of Japan. The United Press International Washington dispatch on January 26 revealed that senior U.S. officials admitted that Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines "are most afraid that the United States believes that the peace treaty with Japan should not include an attitude prohibiting the rearming of Japan." The agency's London dispatch on February 7 also stated that British officials said that Australia and New Zealand "hold the same fears about Japan's rearmament as France holds about Germany (referring to the U.S. arming of West Germany)." In addition, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines have differences of opinion with the United States on issues such as reparations and the economy with regard to Japan.

    Dulles' conspiratorial activities in Australia have first and foremost met with angry opposition from the Australian people. According to the Dentsu news agency, on the second day after Dulles arrived in Australia (the 14th), the Australian people held an unprecedentedly large demonstration in Sydney. A large group of demonstrators gathered in front of the local U.S. consulate, shouting "Dulles, go home!"

    The ruling groups of Australia and New Zealand, based on their own interests, do not entirely agree with the U.S. policy toward Japan. According to the United Press International Canberra dispatch on the 13th, Australia "has little real enthusiasm for Dulles' plan." According to Dentsu news agency, British "senior authorities" revealed that at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London in January, the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand and other countries suggested not supporting the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan. Australian Prime Minister Menzies and New Zealand Prime Minister Holland declared that the two countries "will not participate in any treaty that does not prevent the restoration of Japan's war potential and limit Japan's despicable trade competition methods such as dumping." As early as November 28 of last year, the Associated Press also revealed that Pacific countries such as Australia and the Philippines advocated "restricting Japanese industry to eliminate the possibility of Japanese industrial organizations, such as those that have been fully restored, becoming a source of commercial competition."

    Even the Philippines, a U.S. puppet state, does not completely submit to the U.S. policy toward Japan. During his stay in the Philippines, Dulles held talks with Philippine puppet President Quirino, Senate Speaker Cuenco, and House Speaker Perez. According to the United Press International Manila dispatch on the 12th, the content of the talks included: "Japan's rearmament, its territorial limits, its United Nations membership, the Philippines' eight billion U.S. dollar compensation claim against Japan, etc." According to the United Press International Manila dispatch on the 14th, the result of the talks was that the Philippine "Foreign Ministry sources" revealed: "There were no clear results." Especially on the issue of compensation, according to Agence France-Presse, "the main opinion in Congress and a large part of the press insist on compensation." Dulles issued a statement on the 12th after meeting with Quirino, openly forcing the Philippines to abandon its claim for compensation from Japan. He said: "The current situation in Japan makes us unable to see any practical way for Japan to obtain these compensations." However, according to Agence France-Presse, "such a political move to abandon the compensation claim will definitely cause extremely bad reactions here." Therefore, it is said that the head of the Philippine puppet government "is trying to find some way to save face."

### 菲、澳、新三国政府  对武装日本意见分歧  杜勒斯的活动受到澳国人民反对

　　菲、澳、新三国政府
　  对武装日本意见分歧        
    杜勒斯的活动受到澳国人民反对
    【新华社十六日讯】战争贩子杜勒斯于十一日自东京抵达菲律宾，活动两天后，已于十三日飞抵堪培拉，开始与澳大利亚和新西兰政府进行会谈。
    杜勒斯到菲律宾、澳大利亚与新西兰三国去的主要目的在于胁迫这三个国家俯从美国重新武装日本的政策。早在一月二十六日，杜勒斯使团在华盛顿的发言人即曾透露：“杜勒斯此行最重要的使命之一，就是要说服澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾，使它们相信它们用不着害怕日本重新武装——这一着是对日媾和后必然的副产品”。当杜勒斯在日本活动的时期，各方传来消息说明：这些国家都恐惧美国重新武装日本。美国合众社华盛顿一月二十六日电透露，美国高级官员承认：澳、新、菲三国“最怕美国认为对日和约不应包括禁止重新武装日本的态度”。该社伦敦二月七日电又说，英国官方人士称：澳大利亚与新西兰对于日本重新武装问题“抱着像法国对于德国（按指美国武装西德）所抱的同样的忧惧”。此外，澳、新、菲三国在对日本的赔偿、经济等问题，也与美国存在着歧见。
    杜勒斯在澳大利亚的阴谋活动，首先遭到该国人民的愤怒的反对。据电通社报道，在杜勒斯抵澳的第二天（十四日），澳大利亚人民在悉尼激昂地举行了规模空前的大示威。大群的示威者聚集在当地美国领事馆门前，高呼“杜勒斯、滚回去！”
    澳大利亚与新西兰的统治集团，基于本身的利害，也不完全赞同美国的对日政策。据合众社堪培拉十三日电透露，澳大利亚“对杜勒斯的计划很少真正的热情”。据电通社称，英国“高级权威人士”透露，在一月间的英联邦总理伦敦会议上，澳大利亚和新西兰等国总理都建议不要支持美国拟订的对日和约草案。澳总理孟席斯和新西兰总理赫兰宣称：该两国“将不参加任何没有防制日本战争潜力的恢复以及限制日本倾销之类的卑鄙贸易竞争手段的和约”。早在去年十一月二十八日，美联社亦曾透露，澳大利亚、菲律宾等太平洋国家主张“限制日本工业，以消灭日本工业组织如经充分恢复成为商业上竞争来源的可能性”。
    甚至菲律宾这样美国的仆从国，对美国的对日政策也不是完全俯首贴耳。杜勒斯在留菲期间，曾与菲傀儡总统季里诺、参院议长库恩柯、众院议长皮利兹等人会谈。据合众社马尼拉十二日电透露，会谈的内容包括：“日本重新武装、它的领土限度、它的联合国会员资格、菲律宾对日本的八十亿美元赔偿要求等”。会谈的结果，据合众社马尼拉十四日讯，菲“外交部方面人士”透露：“没有明确的结果”。特别在赔偿问题上据法新社透露，菲“国会中的主要意见和报界的一大部分都坚持赔偿”。杜勒斯在十二日与季里诺会谈后即发表声明，公开迫使菲律宾放弃对日本的赔偿要求。他说：“现在日本的局势使我们看不出有任何实际的方法由日本取得这些赔偿”。但是，据法新社称，“放弃赔偿要求这种政治举动，一定在此间引起极端不好的反应”。因此，据说菲律宾傀儡政府的首脑“正在企图找一些挽救面子的办法”。
