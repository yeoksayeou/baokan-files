Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd: To promote exchange between urban and rural areas and formulate a purchase and sales plan for 1951, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened a native produce conference—a conference on the purchase and sale of grain, mountain dried and fresh goods—from January 23rd to 30th. Representatives from Tianjin's private wholesale grain, import and export, northern and southern native produce, warehouses, dried and fresh fruit, sugar and grocery, and edible oil industries participated in the conference, as did old merchants from other places who were in Tianjin for procurement, and representatives from relevant government and CCP party departments. The Financial and Economic Committees of the People's Governments of Hebei, Suiyuan, and Pingyuan provinces, and the Shanxi Provincial State-owned Native Produce Company also sent personnel to attend.

The Tianjin Native Produce Conference initially drafted a general management plan for forty-eight important native products for 1951. According to this plan, native products worth nearly ten billion catties of millet will be transported from Tianjin to various places. During the conference, representatives from various industries and purchasing agents from other places exchanged information on the production, sales, and circulation routes of various native products in various regions, initially formulated methods to open up sales channels for seasonal native products, and decided to strive to restore the old markets for various native products in the Northeast region and Shanghai, and to open up new markets in the Guangzhou and Shantou areas. The grain industry also plans to transport surplus grain from the Northwest to cotton-producing areas and disaster areas.

In accordance with the principle of taking both public and private interests into account, the representatives attending the meeting, based on past experience, put forward the management plan for 1951, preparing to cooperate with the state-owned economy to stabilize prices, take care of the interests of production, management, and consumption, concentrate funds, and organize and strengthen joint operation institutions. The conference also decided that each industry should establish a purchase and sales research committee to plan and promote the management of native products.

In addition, the Tianjin Native Produce Conference also discussed the issue of import and export enterprises engaging in both port-to-port trade and the problem of chain management of industrial products and native products in various industries, and put forward some opinions on improving transportation, loans, taxation and other issues.
