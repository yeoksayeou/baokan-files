　　Introduction to the Harbin Municipal Middle School Teachers' Night School
　　Zhang Gang
    The Harbin Middle School Teachers' Cultural Night School was established in early 1950. Its purpose is to improve the professional level of some in-service teachers, so that they can be competent for various teaching tasks in junior high school and grades one and two of senior high school within two or three years.

    The night school temporarily offers two subjects: Chinese Language and Mathematics. The Chinese Language students include Chinese Language teachers and general young administrative cadres; the Mathematics students are mostly Mathematics teachers, with a small number of Physics and Chemistry teachers.

    The curriculum follows the standard of the Chinese Language and Mathematics Specialization (training junior high school teachers, with a two-year study period) of Northeast Normal University, selecting the main subjects to reach graduation level.

    The night school also stipulates certain academic year, semester, examination, promotion, graduation, and leave systems. One academic year is divided into two semesters, with classes held twice a week (two hours each time) for sixteen weeks per semester. There are two examinations per semester. Those who pass are promoted, those who are excellent are rewarded, and those who fail must take a make-up exam or repeat the course. A certificate is issued upon completion of all courses, permitting graduation.

    Teachers can voluntarily sign up to participate in the study, but after signing up, they are not allowed to drop out or take leave casually. Leave must be approved by the principal of the original school, otherwise it will be considered an absence. One absence will deduct one point from the total semester score, and three absences will result in expulsion.

    After a year of trial operation, the school has achieved initial success and gained some experience:

    First, the professional level of the teachers participating in the night school has improved significantly. For example, in the first semester, the Chinese Language Class A studied Grammar and Selected Readings in Literature, and generally, they were able to correctly analyze words, sentences, and the themes of articles. They also had a relatively deep understanding of the artistic and political nature of literature, as well as the relationship between works and writers.

    The progress of the Mathematics subject is even more obvious. In the opening test of the first semester, the average score of Mathematics Class A was 63.4 points, and it reached 82.4 points in the semester examination; the number of students who failed the opening test in Class B accounted for 83.4 percent, with an average score of 36.2 points, and the number of students who failed at the end of the term decreased to 17.6 percent, with an average score increasing to 72 points.

    Second, the teachers participating in the night school also received help and improvement in their work. Chinese Language teachers generally reflected that their ability to correct assignments had improved after studying grammar; and the study of selected readings in literature improved their ability to analyze texts. At the same time, because the Mathematics teachers combined the junior high school mathematics textbooks for explanation, it directly helped their teaching.

    Because the night school can truly help teachers improve their professional level and teaching ability, many teachers consciously squeeze out time to attend night school and can persevere to the end.

    This successful experience proves that teacher night schools can be established in large cities where schools are relatively concentrated (initially, two or three subjects can be offered, and then gradually expanded).

    The reason why the Harbin City Teachers' Night School was able to persist and achieve certain results in the past year of trial operation is mainly due to:

    (1) Clear learning objectives, suitable for the requirements and work needs of teachers. Because the level of middle school teachers in Northeast China varies greatly, some teachers have a lower level and have not received professional training (in middle schools, this group of teachers is quite large). Therefore, this kind of learning is very suitable for their needs. And the schools also urgently require them to improve their professional level and reach the level of graduation from a university specialization. This gives the teachers participating in the study a certain period of effort goals.

    (2) The problem of teachers was solved by using two methods: "teachers teaching teachers" and hiring professors from universities or specialized schools to teach part-time. That is, selecting more excellent members from middle school teachers to serve as night school teachers. At the same time, professors from Changchun Normal University were hired on a contract basis to attend lectures regularly (with appropriate remuneration). In this way, not only is the quality of night school teaching improved, but also the professors have more contact with the actual situation of middle school teachers and the problems in middle school teaching, which is also helpful to them.

    (3) Leadership's attention and specific help. The Harbin Municipal Education Bureau attaches great importance to the work of the night school, with the director of the bureau serving concurrently as the principal of the night school, providing specific leadership and assistance to the night school. And promptly solve the difficulties of lecturers and students, in order to reduce the work of lecturers in the original school, criticize some school leaders for neglecting the work of the night school, affecting the learning of students. Schools that can guarantee students' study time and can help them overcome difficulties are commended. In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau also helps the night school solve administrative expenses and lecturers' allowances.

　　介绍哈尔滨市中学教师夜校
　　张刚
    哈尔滨中学教师文化夜校，系于一九五○年初创立。目的在提高部分在职教师的业务水平，使他们在二、三年内达到胜任初中及高中一、二年级的各种教学工作。
    夜校暂设国文与数学两科：国文科学员一部分是国文教师，另一部分是一般青年行政干部；数学科学员多数是数学教师，一小部分为理化教师。
    课程以东北师范大学国文及数学专修科（培养初中师资，修业两年）为标准，选修其中主要科目，达到毕业水平。
    夜校并规定了一定的学年、学期、考试、升级、毕业、请假等制度。一学年分两学期，每学期上课十六周，每周上课两次（每次两小时）。一学期考试两次，及格者升级，优秀者奖励，不及格者补考或重读。修完全部课程后发给证明书准予毕业。
    教师们可自愿报名参加学习，但报名以后，即不允许随便退学与随便请假。请假时必须经原校校长证明，否则以旷课论，旷课一次扣学期总分一分，旷课三次开除学籍。
    经过一年的试办，该校已初步获得成功，并取得了一些经验：
    首先，参加夜校学习的教师，业务水平有了比较显著的提高。例如第一学期国文甲班学习了文法与文学选读，已普遍能正确地分析词句与文章主题；对于文学的艺术性与政治性，作品与作家等问题，也有了比较深刻的理解。
    数学科的进步更是明显。第一学期开学测验时，数学甲班总平均六三·四分，学期考试时达到八二·四分；乙班开学测验不及格人数占百分之八三·四，总平均三六·二分，期末不及格的减少到百分之一七·六，总平均提高到七二分。
    其次，参加夜校学习的教师，在工作上也获得了帮助与改进。国文教师普遍反映，学习文法以后，批改作业的能力提高了；而文学选读的学习，则提高了他们的分析课文的能力。同时，由于数学科教师结合初中数学教材进行讲解，直接帮助了他们的教学。
    由于夜校真正能帮助教师提高业务水平与教学能力，许多教师都自觉地挤出时间进夜校学习，并能始终坚持不懈。
    这个成功的经验证明：在学校较为集中的大城市，可以开办教师夜校（开始时可办二、三个科，以后逐渐扩大）。
    哈市教师夜校在过去试办的一年中，所以能坚持下来，并获得一定的成绩，主要是由于：
    （一）学习目标明确，适合于教师的要求与工作的需要。因为东北中学教师的水平参差不齐，一部分教师水平较低，没有受过专业训练（在中学里，这部分教师为数不少）。因此，这样学习是非常适合于他们的要求的。而学校也迫切地要求他们提高自己的业务水平，达到大学专修科毕业程度。这就使参加学习的教师有了一定时期的努力目标。
    （二）用“以教师教教师”和聘请大学或专科学校教授兼课的两种办法解决了师资问题。即从中学教员中选拔比较优秀的分子来担任夜校教师。同时又以订合同的方式聘请了长春师范大学教授定期出席授课（给以适当报酬）。这样，不仅使夜校教学质量更加提高，而且使教授们更多接触中学教师的实际情况与中学教学中的问题，对他们也有帮助。
    （三）领导的重视与具体帮助。哈市教育局很重视夜校的工作，由局长兼任夜校校长，对夜校加以具体领导与帮助。并及时解决讲师及学员的困难，为减轻讲师在原校的工作，批评某些学校负责人忽视夜校工作，影响学员学习的现象。对能保证学员学习时间，并能帮助他们克服困难的学校，则给予表扬。此外，市教育局还帮助夜校解决行政费用与讲师的津贴。
