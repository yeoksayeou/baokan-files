　　Forestry Model - Wang Qingheng

　　In Chunsheng Village, Second District, Muling County, Songjiang Province, there is a forest ranger named Wang Qingheng. He was born into a poor family and worked as a swineherd and horseherd from a young age. At the age of sixteen, he started doing manual labor for others, and it wasn't until after liberation that he truly stood up. On November 8, 1948, he honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

　　Since Wang Qingheng was elected as the forest ranger of Chunsheng Village in 1949, the forest area of more than one hundred *li* he was in charge of has remained safe and sound. Therefore, he was elected as a first-class model at the district's summary meeting. Last year, at the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, he was selected as the provincial forestry model to attend the congress. He knows that forests are very important to the country and the people, so he goes everywhere to tell the masses the importance of protecting forests. He said, "We humans cannot do without wood. A person needs a wooden cradle from birth, and a wooden coffin when they die; not to mention building houses, making farm tools, and making furniture." He said, "Areas with forests have guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood, and you can also pick tree ears, grapes, and mushrooms in summer and autumn. The same goes for the country! Without wood, construction cannot be done well." After the masses understood these principles, he organized them according to their production conditions and divided the work to protect the forests cooperatively. He discovered that in the local forest area, some people were making *chuan tiaozi* for the gold mine bureau. In the past, they did not pay much attention to fire, and fires often occurred. Because the personnel were disorganized, he suggested and helped them organize. He discovered that many fires were caused by burning paper during grave sweeping every year, so he persuaded these people to bring shovels, remove the grass in front of the graves, dig small pits, put the paper in the pits to burn, and leave after the fire was extinguished.

　　Wang Qingheng often says that if you want to do a good job, you should lead by example. The forest area of more than one hundred *li* under his management, he must enter the deep mountains for inspection once a week. Sometimes his shoes are worn out, and his clothes are torn, and he has to report the inspection situation to the district government and the forestry bureau when he returns.

　　He is not arrogant or complacent because he was elected as a national model. He said, "What are my methods? Aren't these what the masses told me, and what the Party taught me? What do I have to be proud of! I will always ensure that there are no fires in the forest area I manage, and that no trees are damaged!"

　　护林模范——王清恒
    松江省穆棱县二区纯盛村有一个叫王清恒的护林员。他是一个穷人家的孩子，从小就给人家放猪、放马，十六岁就给人家抗活，一直到解放后他才算翻了身。一九四八年十一月八日他光荣的参加了中国共产党。
    王清恒自一九四九年当选为纯盛村的护林员以后，他所管的一百多里方圆的林区，一直安全无事。因此，他在区的总结会议上当选一等模范，去年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，又被选为省的护林模范而出席了代表会议。他知道森林对国家对人民的关系是很重要的，因此他就到处对群众讲爱护森林的道理。他说：“我们人是缺少不了木头的，人一生下来就得用木头做一个摇车子，老死了还得用木头做个棺材；盖房子、作农具、作家具那更不用说啦。”他说：“有树林子的地方是水旱保收的，到了夏天秋天还可以采木耳、葡萄、蘑菇。国家也是这样！缺了木头就建设不好。”等到群众懂得了这些道理以后，他就把群众根据生产条件组织起来，分工合作防护森林。他发现了该地林区山里有群众给金矿局做串条子的，过去他们对火很不注意，常发生火灾，人员又很乱，他就建议并帮助他们，组织起来。他发现了每年上坟烧纸引火的很多，他就劝说这些上坟的人带着铁锹，到坟前把草除了，并挖小坑，将纸放在坑里烧，等火灭再走。
    王清恒常说，工作要想做好，自己应做在前面。他所管的一百多里方圆的林区，一个礼拜他就要进入深山巡查一次，有时鞋走坏了，衣服也挂破了，回来还得向区政府和林务局汇报检查情况。
    他并不以当选了全国的模范而骄傲自满，他说：“我这点办法还算个啥？这还不是群众告诉我的，还不是党所教给我的，我还有什么骄傲的！我要永远保证我管的这一片森林不发生火灾，不让一棵树木遭到损失！”
