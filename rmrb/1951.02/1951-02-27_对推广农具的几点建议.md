To the Editor:

Last year, Jilin Province encountered many problems in supplying agricultural tools for the spring plowing season. The main reason was a lack of planning, resulting in the blind production of agricultural tools that did not meet the needs of farmers, leading to a backlog of unsold equipment. I believe that the following points should be considered when manufacturing agricultural tools this year:

First, thorough investigations should be conducted in advance to understand the specifications and quantities of agricultural tools needed by local farmers. Then, based on the production capacity of local public and private enterprises, a unified production plan should be made, with division of labor and cooperation, so as to achieve a balance between production and sales.

Second, newly manufactured agricultural tools should first be produced as samples and taken to rural areas for trial use. Farmers should be consulted for their opinions on improving the products, and unified specifications should be established before mass production. For example, the Fumin Iron Factory in Sanchahe, Fuyu County, identified the problems with the plows manufactured last year based on the opinions of the masses and improved them, which was very popular among the farmers.

Third, cooperatives or private merchants in various localities should also pay attention to the specifications, quality, and farmers' needs of local agricultural tools when purchasing them. For example, last year the Dehui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought small hoes for planing stubble from Shenyang, and the Sanchahe branch of the Fuyu County Cooperative bought hoe blades from Changchun, neither of which met the specifications for local use, resulting in their failure to sell. For this reason, cooperatives in various localities should conduct comprehensive surveys and statistics work, formulate plans, and, as far as possible, sign sales and ordering contracts with local public and private enterprises to ensure the timely supply of farmers' needs.

　　对推广农具的几点建议
    编辑同志：
    去年吉林省在供给春耕农具中发生了不少的问题。主要是由于缺乏计划性，盲目地生产不适合农民需要的农具，以致造成农具积压的现象。我想在今年制造农具时应注意：
    第一，事先应当深入调查，了解当地农民所需要农具的规格、数量，然后再根据当地公、私营企业的生产能力，作出统一的生产计划，分工合作，这样就可以达到产销平衡。
    第二，新制造的农具，应首先做出样品，拿到农村中去试用，征求农民对产品的改进意见，作出统一的规格后，再大批制造。像扶余县三岔河扶民铁工厂，根据群众意见，找出了去年制造的铧子的毛病，加以改进，就很受农民的欢迎了。
    第三，各地合作社或私商在采购农具时，亦应注意当地农具的规格，质量和农民的需要等。如去年德惠县供销社由沈阳买来了千斤刨槎子的小镐，扶余县社三岔河分社从长春买回的锄板，都不合当地使用的规格，结果卖不出去。为此，各地合作社应当进行全面调查统计工作，订出计划，并尽可能和当地公、私企业订立推销、订货等合同，以保证及时供应农民的需要。
