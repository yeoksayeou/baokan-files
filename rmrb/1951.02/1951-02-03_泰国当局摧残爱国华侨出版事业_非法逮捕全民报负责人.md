Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, Bangkok Dispatch: According to news from Bangkok, Thailand, Cai Zhihong, the editor-in-chief of the patriotic overseas Chinese newspaper "Quanmin Bao" ("The People's Daily") in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, and Wu Jianzhong, the publisher of the newspaper, were unreasonably arrested by the Thai police on January 31st. The excuse used by the reactionary Thai authorities for the arrest was that "Quanmin Bao" published articles by local overseas Chinese boycotting American goods and refusing to watch American movies. The Thai Ministry of Interior even threatened to deport Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong. "Quanmin Bao" has lodged a strong protest with the Thai government regarding this matter.

　　泰国当局摧残爱国华侨出版事业
    非法逮捕全民报负责人
    【新华社二日讯】据曼谷消息：在泰国首都曼谷的爱国华侨所出版的报纸《全民报》的总编辑蔡志宏及该报出版人吴建中于一月三十一日竟被泰国警察无理逮捕。泰国反动当局进行逮捕的借口是全民报登载了当地华侨抵制美国货和不看美国电影的文章。泰国内政部并扬言要将蔡志宏和吴建中驱逐出境。全民报已就此事向泰国政府提出强烈抗议。
