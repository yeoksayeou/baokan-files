　　Guangdong Shunde Sugar Factory Leaps Forward in the Great Leap
　　Shi Hanrong
            First, Look at the Numbers
    The Guangdong Shunde Sugar Factory, back in the hands of the people for just one year, experienced rapid development in 1950 and became a bright flower among state-owned enterprises in Guangdong! A comparison of a few figures reveals the factory's continuous improvement in production. In the first crushing season after takeover (1949-1950), the average daily crushing volume was 1005.3 metric tons, and the corrected overall recovery rate (an international standard for sugar-making technology) was 79.88 percent, a record never seen before liberation. The current crushing season (1950-1951), which officially started on November 10th last year, saw an average daily crushing volume of 1082.4 metric tons in the first period, and the corrected overall recovery rate reached 81.91 percent. This not only broke the 1949 record but also exceeded the new quality standards set for this crushing season.
            Workers Strive, Machines Renewed
    The factory suffered many disasters in the past, and when it returned to the people, the machinery was dilapidated. After the takeover last year, work immediately resumed. It wasn't until the end of crushing last April that a large-scale repair project could be carried out. The state provided money, the workers contributed ideas, and the Communist Party led the way, resulting in the renovation of many machines!
    The most extensive project was the reconstruction of the large foundation piers of the crushing machines. As early as 1946, the piers had cracks and subsidence, causing the machines to vibrate during operation. The reactionary government only knew how to be corrupt and disregarded production. The engineers at the time were just going through the motions, and all the machinery was installed by foreigners. Some parts (like the governor of the steam engine) had never been disassembled. There was a lack of confidence as to whether they could be reinstalled correctly. The Communist Party inspired the enthusiasm of the working class, giving the workers enough courage to overcome difficulties. They finally dismantled and moved out all the heavy and massive machines of the crushing section, destroyed the old piers, rebuilt new ones with reinforced concrete, and then reinstalled and restored the machines. The whole process took four months and was completed successfully.
    The crushing section had the most problems, and the workers in the crushing section also put forward the most rationalization proposals. A total of fourteen proposals were adopted and proven to contribute to the improvement of production after startup. Some of the more important ones are listed below. The governor of the crushing section's steam engine was out of order, and no one had dared to repair it for more than ten years, considering it a mysterious difficulty that only foreigners could overcome. This year, technician Li Tongci and four others suggested repairing it. The engineers assisted them, and it was finally repaired, increasing its sensitivity by 20 percent compared to before the repair, almost as good as new. In previous years, the cane grab had to be repaired more than once every small period. After technicians Luo Quan and Du Gannan modified its internal parts, it had no problems for nearly a month after startup. The channel steel of the cane conveyor belt of the cane conveying machine had been heavily corroded due to years of rotation and friction. In the past, it was patched with iron sheets, which was inconvenient and prone to problems. New channel steel was not easy to buy. Technician Luo Quan suggested turning the original channel steel over for use, and the effect was exactly the same as new, saving 280 feet of channel steel measuring four and three-quarters inches high and two inches wide. Using waste parts cleared out during inventory, technician Feng Jia of the repair department revived a small generator that had been ineffectively repaired for many years. He also cured the problem of the second turbine generator in the power room "feeling cold" (i.e., vibrating violently) during operation.
    Many difficulties were overcome with collective wisdom. After more than ten years of use, the diameter of the crushing rollers became smaller, reducing crushing efficiency. Two crushing rollers left by the Japanese at the Shitou Sugar Factory are now being modified for use, which will improve crushing efficiency. In previous years, the maximum vacuum of the vacuum pump was 27.5 inches. After repair and replacement of parts, it has increased to 28.5 inches, reaching the general standard of new machines. The heating copper tubes (a total of more than 200) in the three vacuum sugar boiling tanks were leaking, reducing heat transfer efficiency by 10 percent. There was no material to replace them with new tubes. This phenomenon had been discovered for many years, but no solution could be found. After everyone studied it, they came up with a method of welding with gas welding, and the result was excellent. More than 20 days after startup, there was no leakage.
            Improved Product Quality
    The workers used the machines they had repaired to actively produce and strive to overfulfill the task. They closely watched the rotation of the machines and carefully listened to their sounds. If there was any abnormality, they quickly rushed to repair them. In the first period, the newly installed cane juice pump bearing in the large crushing section overheated (due to the lack of tools during installation, it was not installed accurately), causing the motor load to be too large and the rotor to smoke. The workers immediately stopped the machine for repair and fixed it in an hour, which was difficult to do in the past. In order to improve quality, they also worked hard to study all possible improvement methods. For example, recently, molasses was flying out from the sugar screen bottom of the white sugar centrifugal honey separator, increasing invisible losses. Now everyone is paying close attention to this issue, and running to the centrifuge to study it whenever they have free time, hoping to come up with a method to improve it. Military Representative Ye Zequan attached great importance to production, and spent most of his time in the factory. Comrades in the laboratory regularly test the chemical composition of the products at each link, and immediately issue a warning if the standards are not met. Under the consistent efforts of all employees, the production results are getting better and better each period. For example, the average daily crushing volume during the trial crushing period was 999.84 metric tons, and the first period increased to 1082.4 metric tons; the corrected overall recovery rate also increased from 81.06 percent in the trial crushing period to 81.91 percent in the first period. Except for the crushing rate (the percentage of sugar extracted from the sugar content) of 91.29 percent in the first period, which has not yet reached the new standard (92 percent), all other production items have exceeded the standard. The employees unanimously expressed their complete confidence in overfulfilling the task.
            Agricultural Work Closely Cooperates, Providing Conditions for Overproduction
    Implementing the policy of uniting and helping cane farmers and ensuring the supply of raw materials, the Agricultural Affairs Section vigorously carried out planned agricultural loan work. The work team went deep into the cane-growing areas, and with the assistance of district and township governments and farmers' associations, directly distributed four agricultural loans (People's Bank agricultural loans, sugar company fertilizer loans, autumn grain rations loans, and cane-cutting turnover funds) directly to the vast number of poor cane farmers. Following this, all the loan-receiving cane farmers were organized into eighty cane households, and cane household meetings were held to solve many technical problems related to cane delivery. A total of over 49,000 mu of cane-delivery areas were registered, with a total cane delivery volume of 16,837.258 metric tons. Agricultural loans solved the difficulties of cane farmers, increased sugarcane production, made the relationship between the factory and cane farmers closer and more harmonious, and ensured the supply of raw materials. After the start-up, the agricultural affairs work closely paid attention to the coordination of raw material transportation, so as not to cause too little sugarcane to arrive, causing shutdown losses; and not to cause too much to arrive, causing losses in the conversion of cane sugar. When inspecting sugarcane, the decisions of the inspection committee jointly formed by the factory and cane farmer representatives were implemented. Unripe, diseased, insect-infested, muddy, excessively long tail or sugar cane with excessive sugar cane whiskers had to be discounted or not accepted. Therefore, the quality of raw materials has improved this year, with an average of less than 1.67% of foreign matter (first small period). This makes the crushing and refining efficiency during processing improve, providing an important condition for overfulfilling the task.
            Production Increases One Inch, Welfare Increases One Point
    The workers created great labor fruits in the last crushing season. Production increases one inch, welfare increases one point, and they are enjoying generous welfare benefits. The trade union office, the workers' cooperative, and the workers' children's school have all been completed. The children's school is a complete primary school with more than 120 students, and it is said that the equipment is the best among all primary schools in Shunde County. The barbershop of the cooperative uses first-class equipment from Guangzhou City and charges third-class prices. All the workers' dormitories have undergone major repairs, with four to six people per room, with single wooden beds, tables, and stools. In addition, nine buildings (a total of ninety rooms) of workers' family dormitories are under construction. In terms of cultural learning, there is a small library, a workers' school, and workers' study classes. Currently, the workers are, under the mobilization of comrades from the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions stationed in the factory and trade union comrades, conducting current affairs studies.
            Further Political Improvement is Needed
    At present, the progress of the improvement of the workers' political consciousness is not very commensurate with the rapid leap forward in production and welfare. The workers generally have a strong economic point of view or a "bonus" point of view. At present, no one is indeed not working hard on production, but one of the main motivations for maintaining labor enthusiasm is to strive for more bonuses. Therefore, many workers dislike attending large classes, are not active in learning, are not interested in current affairs, and think that production has nothing to do with politics. This is the result of the leadership (including the administration and the trade union) only concentrating its efforts on production and neglecting the political education of the workers in peacetime, which must be brought to the attention of the responsible comrades. Especially in the current upsurge of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, combining production with strengthening current affairs study is one of the important tasks. According to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we should step up the development of patriotic production competitions, give the already highly developed productivity rich revolutionary content, consolidate it, and develop it to a higher degree!

　　广东顺德糖厂在跃进中
　　施汉荣
            先看数字
    回到人民手里刚刚一年的广东顺德糖厂，一九五○年有了快速的发展，成为广东境内国营企业的一朵鲜花！从几个数字的对比，就可以看出该厂的生产在不断提高。接管后第一榨季（一九四九至一九五○）每日平均榨蔗量是一○○五·三公吨，改正总收回率（国际性的制糖技术标准）是百分之七九·八八，是解放前没有过的纪录。本榨季（一九五○至一九五一）于去年十一月十日正式开始后，第一小期每日平均榨蔗量达一○八二·四公吨，改正总收回率达百分之八一·九一；这不但突破了一九四九年的纪录，也超过了本榨季新定的质量标准。
            职工努力，机器翻新
    该厂过去多灾多难，当回到人民手里时，机器已经残破不堪。去年接管后立刻要复工生产，直到去年四月停榨，才有机会进行大规模的修建工程。国家拿出钱，职工动脑筋，共产党领导，就使许多机器翻了新！
    最浩大的工程是榨压机大基墩的重建。早在一九四六年，基墩已有裂痕及下沉现象，开机时机器发生震动。反动政府只知贪污不顾生产，工程师们当时是“做日和尚敲日钟”的，而且全部机器都由外国人安装，有些部分（如蒸汽机的调速器）从来没有人拆过，拆了，能否再安装好呢？没信心。共产党启发了工人阶级的积极性，使职工有克服困难的足够勇气，终于将全压榨部笨重巨大的机器拆下迁出，破坏了旧的基墩，用钢筋三合土重建新的，然后将机器安装复原，前后共四个月，胜利完工。
    压榨部的毛病最多，压榨部的工友所提出的合理化建议也最多，计被采纳又在开机后证实对改进生产有贡献的共有十四种。其中比较重要的有下列这些。压榨部蒸汽机的调速器失灵，十多年来没有人敢去修理，视为只有外国人才能克服的神秘困难。今年技目李同赐等五人建议要修理，工程师协助他们，终于修好，使灵敏度比修理前增加百分之二十，与新的差不多。往年每小期抓蔗机必要修理一次以上，经技目罗全和杜淦年分别改造了它的内部机件之后，开机近一月都没有毛病。输蔗机运蔗带的槽铁，因多年转动摩擦，蚀去甚多，往年用铁片补上，诸多不便，易出毛病，新槽铁又不易买到；技目骆权建议将原槽铁翻转使用，效果与新的完全一样，节省了高四又四分之三英寸阔二英寸的槽铁二百八十英尺。修理部技目冯佳利用清点时清出的废件，使多年来几经修理无效的小型发电机复活；电力房第二座透平发电机开动时“发冷”（即震动得很历害）的毛病，也是他治好的。
    用集体的智慧来克服了的困难很多。压榨辘经十多年使用后，直径变小，压榨效率减低。现将日人遗留在市头糖厂的压榨辘两个，改装使用，提高了压榨效率。往年真空泵最高真空度是二七·五英寸，经修理及换零件后，已增至二八·五英寸，达到了新机器的一般标准。三个真空煮糖罐内的加热铜管（共有二百多条）有渗漏，传热效率减低了百分之十，想换上新管又无材料。此现象已发现多年，都无法解决。经过职工大家研究，想出用气焊的办法来焊接，结果很好，开机后二十多天，都没有渗漏现象。
            提高了产品的质量
    职工们利用自己修好了机器，积极生产，争取超额完成任务。他们密切地注视机器的转动和细心倾听它的音响，一有异样，迅速抢修。在第一小期里，大榨部新装好的蔗汁泵轴承发热（因安装时工具缺乏，装得不够确备），引起马达负荷过大，转子出烟。工友们立刻停机修理，一小时后就修好，这是从前难于做到的。为了提高质量，他们又努力研究一切可能的改进办法，如最近白糖离心分蜜机的糖筛底有糖蜜飞出来，增加无形损失；现大家都密切注意这问题，一有空就跑到离心机旁研究，希望想出办法改进。军事代表叶泽权非常重视生产，他绝大部分的时间都是花在工场里。化验室同志经常检验着每个环节的产品的化学成份，一遇标准不合，立刻提出警告。在全体员工一致努力下，生产成绩一期比一期好，如试榨期每日平均压榨量为九九九·八四公吨，第一小期增至一○八二·四公吨；改正总收回率也从试榨期的百分之八一·○六增至第一小期的百分之八一·九一。除第一小期榨出率（榨出的糖份与含糖份的百分比）百分之九一·二九尚未达新定标准（百分之九十二）外，其余各生产项目都超过标准。职工们一致表示完全有信心超额完成任务。
            农务工作密切配合，提供超额生产的条件
    贯彻着团结、帮助蔗农，保证原料供应的方针，农务科大力进行了有计划的农贷工作。下乡工作队深入所属蔗区，通过区、乡政府及农会的协助，直接将四次贷款（人民银行农贷、糖业公司肥料贷、秋季口粮贷及斩蔗周转金）直接分配到广大贫苦蔗农手中。继将全部受贷蔗农组成八十个蔗户，召开蔗户会议，解决交蔗的许多技术问题。计登记了交蔗总面积共四万九千多亩，交蔗量共一六八三七·二五八公吨。农贷解决了蔗农困难，提高甘蔗产量，使厂与蔗农的关系趋于紧密、融洽，也保证了原料的供应。开机后农务工作密切注意原料运输的配合，不使甘蔗来得太少，引起停机损失；也不使来得太多，引起蔗糖份转化的损失。验收甘蔗时，贯彻厂与蔗农代表合组的监验委员会的决定，未成熟的、病虫害的、带泥多的、蔗尾过长的、蔗须过多的蔗要打折扣或不收。因此，今年原料品质提高，夹杂物平均在百分之一·六七以下（第一小期）。这使加工时的压榨和制炼效率都能提高，为超额完成任务提供了一个重要的条件。
            生产长一寸福利长一分
    职工们在上个榨季中创造了伟大劳动果实。生产长一寸福利长一分，他们正享受着优厚的福利待遇。现工会办公室、职工合作社、工人子弟学校等都已经建筑完成。子弟学校是一间完整的小学，有一百二十多个学生，据说设备是全顺德县小学中最好的。合作社的理发部以广州市特等的设备收丙等的价钱。工人宿舍全部经过大修理，四至六个人一房，有单人独睡木床，有台有凳。另外，九幢（共九十间房）职工家眷宿舍正在建筑中。在文化学习方面有小图书馆，有职工学校及职工学习班。现职工们正在省总工会驻厂同志及工会同志发动下，进行时事学习。
            还要在政治上提高一步
    目前职工政治觉悟提高的进度，与生产和福利的快速跃进比较，显得不很相称。职工们一般存在着浓厚的经济观点或者说“奖金”观点。目前确实没有人不努力生产，但借以维持劳动热忱的主要动机之一，是争取更多的奖金。因此有不少职工讨厌上大课，学习不积极，对时事不感兴趣，认为生产与政治无关。这是领导上（包括行政和工会）平时只集中力量搞生产，疏忽了职工的政治教育的结果，必须引起负责同志的注意。特别在当前抗美援朝保家卫国的热潮中，结合生产加强时事学习是重要工作之一，应该根据全总的号召，加紧展开爱国主义的生产竞赛，给已经高度发挥了的生产力赋以充实的革命内容，巩固它，更高度的发挥它！
