    Farmer Zhang Wensheng Wins Savings Prize and Expands Production
    Zhang Wensheng, a farmer from Yehe Village, Luancheng County, Hebei Province, used his thrift savings of 30,000 yuan to buy prize-winning savings certificates. At the end of last year, he won the first prize, receiving a bonus of 3 million yuan. After receiving the bonus, Zhang Wensheng made a production plan for himself: use 1.2 million yuan to buy a good animal and re-harness the cart that had been stored for many years for transportation; use 1.3 million yuan to buy 2,000 jin of fertilizer to plant ten mu of cotton, estimating that each mu of cotton field can increase cotton production by 300 to 500 jin. This matter has aroused the interest of farmers in nearby villages in saving money.

    农民张文生储蓄得奖扩大生产
    河北省栾城县冶河村农民张文生，将自己节存的三万元买了有奖储蓄券，于去年年底开奖时中了头奖，领得奖金三百万元。张文生领到奖金后，自己做了一个生产计划：用一百二十万元买一头好牲口，把存放多年的大车重新套起来搞运输；用一百三十万元买二千斤肥料种十亩棉花，估计每亩棉田可增产棉花三百到五百斤。这件事，引起了附近各村农民储蓄的兴趣。
