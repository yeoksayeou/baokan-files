    Is the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution a Purely Peasant War?
    To the Editor:
    I saw in the January 11th editorial "Commemorating the Centenary of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution" that "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution is still a purely peasant war." I have a different opinion on this point: In fact, at the time of the Jintian Village Uprising, led by Yang Xiuqing, thousands of charcoal workers were the backbone of the revolutionary ranks. After capturing Wuhan, tens of thousands of boatmen, masons, carpenters, etc., joined. Therefore, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution cannot be said to be a purely peasant war, but rather one in which a considerable number of workers participated and played a significant role.

    Comrade Ni Jianzhong:
    The January 11th editorial in this newspaper, "Commemorating the Centenary of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution," pointed out that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution "is still a purely peasant war." This judgment is correct because the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement was not led by the working class.
    Some people believe that one of the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Eastern King Yang Xiuqing, came from a charcoal worker background, and that many charcoal workers participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution at that time, so they concluded that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was participated in by the working class and played a "leading role." This is not in accordance with the facts.
    First of all, the working class, which is superior to the peasant class in terms of production methods and thus political consciousness, can only be represented and embodied by workers in modern machine industry. These workers are connected with advanced economic forms, that is, large-scale production. Handicraft workers, however, are connected with small-scale production, that is, with backward economic forms. In this respect, handicraft workers are not fundamentally different from peasants. Therefore, if one uses the fact that the revolutionary ranks of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom included handicraft workers and even self-employed handicraftsmen to prove that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement was led by the working class, one is making the mistake of confusing small-scale producers and their employed laborers with industrial workers.
    In addition, according to reliable historical materials, it cannot be said that the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were from handicraft worker backgrounds.
    Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan came from a middle-peasant family (Luo Ergang: Jintian Interview Notes). He had two older brothers. The eldest brother, An King Hong Renfa, who later took charge of the Heavenly Dynasty's administration, was "farming in his hometown"; the second brother, Fu King Hong Renda, was also "helping his father and brothers farm at home" (Luo Ergang: Draft History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Biography 9). His cousin, Xu King Hong Renzheng, claimed: "I am one year older than the Heavenly King. I used to herd cattle at home. Because the house where we worshiped brothers was burned down by a man named Song, I later went to Guangxi with the Heavenly King." (Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Series, Thirteen Types, Second Series, Xu King's Autobiography) This is Hong Xiuquan's family situation. His brothers were either "farming" or "herding cattle," all from peasant backgrounds.
    Eastern King Yang Xiuqing, according to reliable records, was "a native of Jiaying Prefecture, Guangdong, moved to Guangxi, and lived next to Western King Xiao Chaogui, farming together" (Xie Jiehe, *Brief Records of Events in Jinling in the Gui Jia Year*). Other historical materials also say that his "family profession was farming" (Zhang Dejian, *Collected Information on Bandit Activities*). However, later local rumors said that Yang Xiuqing had "worked in planting mountains and burning charcoal" (Ling Shanqing, *Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom*). The so-called "planting mountains" is planting land. Because the area is mountainous and the land is barren, the annual yield from farming is not enough to live on, so charcoal burning was a sideline, which was also a very common phenomenon. He himself was still a poor peasant, not a worker.
    After the Taiping army arrived in Yiyang and Yuezhou, Hunan, they seized many ships and liberated many boatmen. Later, from Yuezhou to Wuhan, and directly to Nanjing, they established a water camp, commanded by Chancellor Tang Zhengcai. After the Taiping army arrived in Nanjing, in order to build the Heavenly King's Palace, Eastern King Yang Xiuqing ordered Qin Rigang and others to recruit construction workers in Hubei and send them back to Tianjing, under the supervision of Bin Fushou (Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Documents). These are all facts.
    However, these workers, whether charcoal workers or boatmen, whether they formally joined later or were of a temporary conscripted nature, were all handicraft workers. As mentioned above, they are fundamentally different from modern industrial workers in politics. Therefore, no matter how many handicraft workers participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary war, it cannot change the nature of this war as a purely peasant war.

### 太平天国革命是不是单纯的农民战争？

　　太平天国革命是不是单纯的农民战争？
    编辑同志：
    我看到一月十一日社论《纪念太平天国革命百周年》文中说：“太平天国革命仍是单纯的农民战争。”我对于这一点有不同的意见：事实上，金田村起义时，以杨秀清为首，数以千计的烧炭工人都是革命队伍的骨干。打下武汉后，又有成万的船工、泥水木工等参加，所以太平天国革命不能说仍是单纯的农民战争，而是有相当数量的工人阶级参加，且起了很大的作用的。
                            平原省人民政府商业厅业务科  倪建中
                                    一九五一年一月十二日
    倪建中同志：
    一月十一日本报《纪念太平天国革命百周年》社论中指出太平天国革命“仍是单纯的农民战争”，这个判断是正确的。因为太平天国的革命运动并没有工人阶级的领导。
    有的人认为太平天国首领之一，东王杨秀清是烧炭工人出身，当时参加太平天国革命的还有很多烧炭工人，因此就断定太平天国革命是由工人阶级参加，并且起了“领导作用”。这是不合事实的。
    首先，在生产方法上从而在政治意识上优于农民阶级的工人阶级，只能以近代机器工业中的工人为代表和主体。这种工人才是与先进的经济形式即大生产联系着的。而手工业工人却是与小生产联系着，就是说，与落后的经济形式联系着。在这一点上手工业工人和农民并没有根本的不同。因此，如果根据太平天国的革命队伍中包含着手工业工人乃至自己占有生产工具的手工业者的事实，来证明太平天国运动是由工人阶级领导，就是犯了把小生产生产者及其所雇佣的劳动者与产业工人相混淆的错误。
    此外，据可靠的史料，也不能说太平天国的领袖们是出身于手工业工人。
    天王洪秀全出身于中农之家（罗尔纲：金田采访记）。他有两个胞兄。后来执掌天朝大政的长兄安王洪仁发，是“居乡耕田”的；次兄福王洪仁达，也是“在家助父兄耕”（罗尔纲：太平天国史稿列传第九）。他的堂兄恤王洪仁政自称：“我比天王大一岁，向在家看牛，因拜兄弟房屋被宋姓烧了，后同天王到广西。”（太平天国丛书十三种第二辑恤王自述）这是洪秀全的家庭情况，他的弟兄们或是“耕田”，或是“看牛”，都是农民出身。
    东王杨秀清，据可靠的记载，是“广东嘉应州人，迁于广西，与西王萧朝贵邻，耦而耕。”（谢介鹤《金陵癸甲记事略》）其他史料也说他“世业农”（张德坚《贼情汇纂》）。但是，后来地方上传说杨秀清曾“以种山烧炭为业”（凌善清《太平天国野史》）。所谓“种山”即是种地。因为当地多山，土地贫瘠，一年种地的出产，不够生活，因此以烧炭为副业，这也是很普通的现象。他本身还是贫农，而不是工人。
    太平军到达湖南益阳和岳州之后，因为卤获了不少船只，解放了许多船工；后来由岳州而武汉，直抵南京，设立水营，由丞相唐正财指挥。太平军到达南京后，为了建筑天王府，经东王杨秀清命令秦日纲等在湖北招集土木工人，送回天京，归宾福寿督管（太平天国文告）。这些都是事实。
    但是这些工人无论是炭工或是船工，无论是后来正式参加的或是属于临时征募的性质，都是手工业工人。如上所说，他们与近代产业工人在政治上是根本不同的。因此不管在太平天国革命战争中有那些手工业工人参加，都不能改变这个战争的单纯的农民战争的性质。
