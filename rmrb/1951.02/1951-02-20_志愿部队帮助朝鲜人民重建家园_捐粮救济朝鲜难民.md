Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is helping Korean refugees rebuild their homes like family members. In some areas of North Pyongan Province and South Hamgyong Province in North Korea, which were severely damaged by the US invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army, many houses were burned down and grain was looted and destroyed, causing residents to fall into a state of hunger and cold. Seeing the deep suffering of the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a grain donation campaign to relieve the affected people. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army saved 800,000 jin of grain from their own rations, which was recently transported to the disaster area and handed over to the local People's Committee for distribution to relieve the victims. The wounded and sick of a certain hospital of the Volunteer Army also donated their surplus grain and clothing to the local refugees. The Korean people who were rescued personally witnessed the People's Volunteer Army overcoming all kinds of difficulties and fighting bravely, liberating them from the slavery of the US and Rhee bandits, and then rescuing them in this most difficult time, and therefore expressed their utmost gratitude.

The People's Volunteer Army also helped the Korean people build new houses from the ruins. A woman named Park Sung-young in a village in South Pyongan Province had her husband killed by the US invading army, and her house was also burned down by the robbers. Eight soldiers of the People's Volunteer Army helped her build two new houses. The People's Volunteer Army stationed in a village in North Pyongan Province helped the villagers build fourteen houses in a week. The Volunteer Army also helped the people in the驻地carry water and clean up their homes during breaks in the battle, which further deepened the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

    捐粮救济朝鲜难民
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民志愿军像亲人一样地帮助朝鲜难民重建自己的家园。在朝鲜北部平安北道和咸镜南道的一些地区，曾迭遭美国侵略军和李承晚伪军的严重破坏，许多房屋被烧毁，粮食也被掠夺糟蹋，因而使居民陷于饥寒交迫的困境。我国人民志愿军看到朝鲜人民的深重灾难，纷纷发动捐粮，救济受难人民。志愿军某部从自己的食粮中节省了八十万斤，已于日前运至灾区，转交当地人民委员会发放，救济灾民。志愿军某部医院的伤病员也将积余的粮食与衣物捐赠当地难民。受到救济的朝鲜人民亲眼看见人民志愿军克服种种困难，英勇作战，把他们从美李匪军的奴役下解放了出来，又在这最困难的时候救济他们，因而表示万分的感激。
    人民志愿军还帮助朝鲜人民从废墟上修建新的房屋。平安南道某村的一位妇女朴成荣，她的丈夫被美国侵略军杀死了，房子也被强盗们烧掉了。人民志愿军的八位战士就帮助她盖了两间新房子。驻在平安北道某村的人民志愿军在一周内帮助村民修盖了十四间房屋。志愿军同时还在战斗间隙中帮助驻地人民担水，收拾家务，更加深了中朝人民的友谊。
