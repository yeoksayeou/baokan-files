    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：日本各工会纷纷表示反对重新武装日本，要求缔结全面和约。据联合通讯社讯：全国官厅工会协议会（即政府机关工作人员的工会）于一月二十五日在东京举行第四次临时大会，通过了要求全面媾和、反对重新武装、保障生活以及加强组织等决议。大会以压倒多数议决发起全面媾和签名运动。在出席大会的十五个工会的一百零五个代表中，有一百人当场签了名。
    日本教职员工会中央委员会于一月二十四、二十五两日举行会议后，发表声明称：该中央委员会“再度确认了五十万教职员的历史任务，决定把一切斗争与要求全面和约及反对重新武装的斗争结合起来”。
    与此同时，国营铁路工会中央委员会战胜了会内分裂分子的反对，决定将“反对重新武装”列入该工会的斗争方针中。
