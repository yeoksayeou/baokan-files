Comrade Chairman! Comrades and Friends!

　　Today, the people of the Soviet Union and China joyfully celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, an excellent historical document marking a new era in the history of relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

　　This day is a festival for all peace-loving people around the world, because the close cooperation between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a guarantee of world peace. Sun Yat-sen, the great democratic revolutionary of China, expressed in his will to the Soviet government: “I hope that the dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed peoples of the world to achieve victory.” Now such a day has arrived.

　　The foundation of the friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China was laid as early as the days of the Great October Socialist Revolution. After the Russian people established Soviet power in their country in 1917, they immediately extended a fraternal hand to their great Chinese neighbor, who was groaning under foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism. In its declarations to the Chinese government on July 25, 1919, and September 27, 1920, the Soviet government abolished all unequal treaties and proposed the conclusion of new treaties based on the recognition of complete equality and independence of China.

　　The Agreement on General Principles for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and the Soviet Union was signed on May 31, 1924. This agreement was the first equal treaty between China and a foreign country. The signing of this agreement opened a serious breach in the entire system of unequal treaties and strengthened the position of national liberation forces in China. The Chinese people, who were struggling against imperialist powers that infringed upon their sovereignty, saw clearly that the Soviet Union was the only force they could rely on in the cause of defending national rights.

　　The Soviet people have always paid close attention to the Chinese revolutionary struggle with warm sympathy and have always been convinced of the victory of the Chinese people. As early as twenty-five years ago, Comrade Stalin predicted: "The strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable. They have not yet fully manifested themselves. In the future, they will be fully manifested. The rulers of the East and the West who do not see these forces and do not give them due estimation will pay the price for it."

　　When the Japanese imperialists launched a widespread military offensive against China in 1937 to completely enslave the Chinese people, the Soviet Union was the only country that supported China. While American monopoly capitalists supplied Japan with military materials and strategic raw materials to carry out a war of aggression in China, the Soviet Union gave China fraternal assistance in its struggle against Japanese aggression. After crushing Hitlerite Germany, the Soviet Union declared war on imperialist Japan, crushed the elite of the Japanese army on the Northeast China battlefield, and forced this long-time enemy of China to surrender.

　　For many years, the peoples of the Soviet Union and China have cherished the desire to unite and strive for peace, democracy, and the happiness of the people, to resist imperialism, and to oppose war. However, the imperialists, especially the bosses of Wall Street, and the successive reactionary governments of China, have done everything possible to prevent the people of our two great countries from uniting, and they have tried their best to isolate the Chinese people from the Soviet Union.

　　The victory of the Chinese people's national liberation struggle under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and the glorious leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, opened up a broad road for cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China for peace and security. The aspirations and expectations of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China for friendship and cooperation were embodied in the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and a number of agreements on economic cooperation between our two countries signed a year ago.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong said when he was about to leave Moscow: "People can see that the unity of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind, and affect the victory of peace and justice in the world." Every provision of this treaty is infused with the desire to consolidate lasting peace by further developing friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and China.

　　The main task of this treaty is to prevent the re-aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive acts. Now, the American imperialists are conducting a separate peace with Japan; under the protection of the American authorities, the reactionaries in Japan are becoming more and more rampant; American imperialism is using all its strength to turn Japan into a strategic bridgehead against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China; finally, Japan has been used as a base for American aggression against Korea and the People's Republic of China; in such a time, how urgent this task is, probably needs no proof.

　　Faced with the increasing aggression in the Far East and the use of Japan as a base for American aggression against Korea and China, the Sino-Soviet Treaty has a particularly important significance, and, undoubtedly, the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, who are firmly united by friendship and alliance, are able to smash any aggression by new would-be world hegemons.

　　According to the treaty, both sides must participate in all international actions aimed at ensuring world peace and security in a spirit of sincere cooperation. In fact, the great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are at the forefront of the struggle, fighting with the people of other countries for peace and against the American and British warmongers. Three hundred and forty million people in both countries have signed the peace declaration.

　　At all international conferences, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries have jointly and consistently exposed the aggressive conspiracies of the American warmongers.

　　In the past year, the two countries have also carried out close cooperation in economic relations in accordance with the treaty, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. This cooperation has promoted the economic development of both the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and has also helped to consolidate the peace and democracy camp.

　　Cultural exchanges between the peoples of our two countries have become regular. In the past year, many Chinese public organizations, artists, trade unionists, and other delegations have visited the Soviet Union. On the other hand, many Soviet delegations have also visited China. The successful production of two outstanding documentary films, "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," is an example of cultural cooperation between our two countries.

　　Molotov said: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed in February, has transformed Sino-Soviet friendship into a great and powerful force in the cause of consolidating world peace, a force that has no parallel in human history, past or present."

　　Only one year has passed, but today no one can deny that this historical foresight has become a reality. The friendship and alliance between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China has become a force that can shatter any conspiracy of the warmongers. No matter how frantically the enemies of peace, democracy, and the imperialist robbers, who attempt to undermine the friendship between the peoples of the two great countries, jump and rage, they will not be able to carry out their despicable and shameless acts.

　　Long live the unbreakable and permanent friendship and cooperation between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world and the best friend of the Chinese people!

### 在首都庆祝中苏同盟条约签订周年纪念大会上  苏联驻华大使罗申的讲话

　　在首都庆祝中苏同盟条约签订周年纪念大会上        
    苏联驻华大使罗申的讲话主席同志！同志和朋友们！
    今天苏联和中国的人民十分欢喜地庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年，这项条约乃是一个绝好的历史性的文件，它标示着苏中两国人民关系史上新的纪元。
    这一天是全世界上所有爱好和平人民的节日，因为苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大人民的亲密合作乃是全世界和平的保证。  中国伟大的民主革命家孙中山曾在致苏联政府的遗书里表示：希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。现在这样的一天已经来到了。
    苏中两国伟大人民的友谊的基础，早在伟大的十月社会主义革命的日子里就已奠定了。俄国人民一九一七年在自己的国家中建立了苏维埃政权以后，立即向呻吟于外国帝国主义和国内封建主义之下的伟大的中国邻人伸出了兄弟之手。苏维埃政府在一九一九年七月二十五日和一九二○年九月二十七日对中国政府的宣言里废除了一切不平等条约并且提议缔结以承认中苏两国完全平等和中国独立为基础的新条约。
    一九二四年五月三十一日签订了中苏解决悬案大纲协定。这一协定乃是中国和外国之间的第一个平等条约：这一协定的签订在不平等条约的整个体系打开了一个严重的裂口，加强了中国国内民族解放力量的地位。向侵犯他们主权的帝国主义列强进行斗争的中国人民，看清了苏联乃是他们在保卫民族权利的事业中能够倚靠的独一无二的力量。
    苏联人民经常怀着热烈的同情心注意中国的革命斗争，并且一向确信中国人民的胜利。远在二十五年以前斯大林同志就曾预言过：“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的。它们现在还没有充分表现出来。在将来它们是会充分表现出来的。看不见这些力量并且不给它们以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要为此付出他们的代价。”
    当一九三七年日本帝国主义者对中国发动广泛的武力进攻、要完全奴役中国人民的时候，苏联是唯一支援中国的国家。正当美国垄断资本家以军用物资和战略上的原料供给日本在中国进行侵略战争的时候，苏联却在中国反抗日本侵略的斗争中给中国以兄弟般的援助。苏联在粉碎希特勒德国之后即对帝国主义的日本宣战，在中国东北战场上击碎了日本军队的精锐，迫使中国的这个宿敌投降了。
    在许多年中，苏中两国人民都怀抱着团结一致争取和平民主和人民幸福、反抗帝国主义、反对战争的想望。但是，帝国主义者，首先是华尔街的老板们以及中国历届反革命政府却无所不为，不容我们两大国人民团结一起，他们极力使中国人民与苏联隔离开来。
    由于英勇的中国共产党和光荣的中国人民领袖毛泽东的领导所得到的中国人民民族解放斗争的胜利，打开了苏中两国人民为了和平与安全的合作大路。苏中两国人民对于友谊与合作的想望和期待在一年前所签订的友好同盟互助条约和关于我们两国之间经济合作的一些协定中体现出来了。
    毛泽东主席在临离莫斯科时说过：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”这一条约的每一条文都灌注着用进一步发展苏中两国友谊与合作的方法来巩固持久和平的渴望。
    这一条约的主要任务就是不许日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。现在，美国帝国主义者正进行单独对日媾和；在美国当局的卵翼下，反动派在日本越来越更嚣张；美帝国主义用尽所有的力量要把日本变作反对苏联和中华人民共和国的战略桥头堡；最后，日本已被利用作美国侵略朝鲜、侵略中华人民共和国的基地；在这样的时候，这个任务是怎样地迫切，大概是无须证明的了。
    面临着在远东的日益增大的侵略和日本被利用作美国侵朝侵华基地，中苏条约便具有了特别重要的意义，而且，无疑的，由友谊和同盟所坚实结合起来的苏联人民和中华人民共和国的人民是能够打破新的图称霸世界者的任何侵略的。
    依照条约，双方必须以忠诚合作的精神参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的的国际行动。实际上苏联与中华人民共和国的伟大人民走在斗争的最前列，和其他各国人民一同争取和平，反抗美英战争贩子。两国已有三万四千万人在和平宣言上签了名。
    在一切国际会议上，苏联、中华人民共和国和一切人民民主国家共同始终不渝地揭露美国战争贩子的侵略阴谋。
    过去一年中，两国也曾依照条约，本着平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的以及不干涉对方内政的原则，在经济关系上进行了紧密的合作。这种合作促进了中华人民共和国和苏联两国的经济发展，也帮助了和平民主阵营的巩固。
    我们两国人民的文化交流已经成为经常的了。在过去一年里，许多中国公众团体、艺术工作者、工会人士等代表团访问了苏联。另一方面，也有许多苏联代表团访问了中国。两部卓越的纪录影片：“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”的摄制成功就是我们两国之间文化合作的实例。
    莫洛托夫说过：“在二月中签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，使中苏友谊在巩固全世界和平的事业上变成为伟大而强大的力量，这个力量在人类历史上过去和现在都没有可以和它比拟的。”
    仅仅过去了一年，但是今天谁也不能否认这种历史上的先见已然成了事实。苏中两国伟大人民的友谊和同盟成了一种力量，它能够打破战争贩子的任何阴谋。无论企图破坏两大国人民友谊的和平民主的仇敌们和帝国主义强盗们怎样暴跳如雷，他们也是施展不了他们卑鄙无耻的行为的。
    苏中两国伟大人民不可破的永久友谊合作万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    全世界劳动者的领袖和导师、中国人民最好的朋友斯大林万岁！
