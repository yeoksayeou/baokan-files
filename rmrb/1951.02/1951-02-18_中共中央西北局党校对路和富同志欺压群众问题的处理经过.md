A response to criticism from the People's Daily

The Handling of Comrade Lu Hefu's Problem of Oppressing the Masses by the Party School of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee
            (Abstracts of letters from the Party School of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee) Editor:
    On October 17, 1950, the People's Daily published a reader's letter entitled "Section Chief Returns Home in an Overbearing Manner, District and Village Cadres are at a Loss," criticizing Comrade Lu Hefu's erroneous behavior. We immediately investigated and dealt with this matter. Now we are informing you of the results of the handling.
    Comrade Lu Hefu was originally the Deputy Section Chief of the Group Teaching Section of the Second Department of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University. He was transferred to the Party School of the Northwest Bureau last June and renamed "Lu Fuhe." It is incorrect to say in the criticism letter that he was the "Section Chief of the Group Teaching Section of the Party School of the Northwest Bureau." The mistakes he committed in his hometown of Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, occurred one month after he came to the Party School to study. Apart from this, all other criticisms in the article are correct.
    One month after Comrade Lu came to the school to study, it was the summer vacation, and he asked for leave to go home to visit relatives. Because he had been away from home for more than ten years, we agreed to his request. During his return home, he listened to the one-sided statements of his brother (the village deputy during the enemy puppet regime), arbitrarily scolded the local district and village cadres, and held lavish banquets, demanding that the masses beat gongs and drums for him to visit and worship his ancestors' graves, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses and damaged the Party's prestige among the masses.
    When we dealt with this issue, in addition to having individual talks with him, we also discussed his problem at the general meeting of the student branch. After the education of the comrades, Lu Hefu realized his mistakes and made a reflection at the branch general meeting; however, he still did not fully understand the nature of the mistakes and their serious consequences. The Party Committee of the Party School of the Northwest Bureau, in addition to continuing to educate him, and with the approval of the higher-level Party Committee, gave him a disciplinary sanction of probation within the Party for half a year.

            (Abstract of a letter from Comrade Lu Hefu) Editor:
    Last August, I returned to my hometown of Hedong Village, Third District, Lingchuan, Shanxi. After listening to the one-sided statement of my brother, Lu Genlei (a household that was struggled against), I thought that the village's handling of my family's problems was biased. When the village cadres Zhang Sangou and Qin Sancheng came to see me, I scolded them indiscriminately. In fact, it was correct that my brother was struggled against because he had served as a puppet village deputy during the enemy puppet period and oppressed the masses. However, I did not think about this aspect, but instead, relying on my "senior qualifications," I became arrogant, opposed the masses, and distorted policies. On August 28th of the same year, in order to show off my power and make a display, I gathered the masses, village cadres, more than 20 people, and beat gongs and drums to visit and worship the graves. In order to retaliate against my personal hatred for my second aunt, I forced my second aunt to cut down dozens of corn stalks in front of my mother's grave, using feudal bully tactics to avenge personal grudges and undermine the policy of our People's Government to reward production.
    Because of my dissatisfaction with the village cadres, I also made irresponsible remarks without principle: the cooperative is a "common meal society," a "eating until it collapses society," and "in a mess." I used this to attack the village cadres and sow discord between the cadres and the masses. This is my serious mistake.
    Although I was born into a poor peasant family and worked as an apprentice for several years when I was young, I have not received a long-term labor training. The feudal ideology of the old society and the petty-bourgeoisie's selfish roots are still very serious. Therefore, for personal gain, I lost the proletariat's position, lost the qualities of a Communist Party member, and committed serious mistakes. I fully accept the criticism of me in the Party newspaper and accept the Party disciplinary sanctions imposed on me by the organization. I will strengthen my study, repent thoroughly, and resolutely serve the Party and the people to the end.
                                     Lu Hefu (now named Lu Fuhe)

### 中共中央西北局党校对路和富同志欺压群众问题的处理经过

　　中共中央西北局党校对路和富同志欺压群众问题的处理经过
            中共中央西北局党校来信摘要编者同志：
    一九五○年十月十七日人民日报发表了标题“科长回乡盛气凌人，区村干部手足无措”的读者来信，对路和富同志的错误行为提出批评，我们即对此事进行了调查处理。今将处理结果告诉你们。
    路和富同志原系西北人民革命大学二部组教科副科长，去年六月间调到西北局党校学习，并更名“路福和”。批评信中说他是“西北局党校组教科长”是不对的。他回山西省陵川县原籍所犯之错误，是他来党校学习一个月以后的事，除此而外，稿中批评各节，是正确的。
    路同志来校学习一月之后，适值暑假，他便要求请假回家探亲。我们因他离家已十余年，便同意了他的要求。他在回籍期间，听他哥哥（敌伪时的村副）一面之词，肆意责骂当地区、村干部，并大设酒筵，要群众为他张锣打鼓登坟祭祖，引起群众不满，损害了党在群众中的威信。
    我们处理这个问题时，除和他进行了个别谈话外，并在学员支部大会上讨论了他的问题。经过同志们的教育，路和富才认识了自己的错误，并在支部大会上作了反省；但他对错误的性质及其严重后果仍认识不足。西北局党校党委会除继续对他进行教育外，并经上级党委批准，予以留党察看半年处分。
                                    中共中央西北局党校
            路和富同志来信摘要编辑同志：
    去年八月间，我回到山西陵川三区河东村原籍。我听了我哥哥路根垒（被斗户）一面之词，就认为村中处理我家中的问题时有偏差。当村干部张三狗、秦三成来看我时，我竟不分皂白，责骂他们。其实我哥哥被斗是正确的，因为他在敌伪时期曾当过伪村副，欺压过群众。可是我没有从这方面去想，只以自己的“老资格”居功自傲，反对群众，歪曲政策。同年八月二十八日，我为了要抖威风，要排场，就集合了群众、村干二十余人，鸣锣击鼓，上坟祭奠。为了报复我对二叔母的私恨，我又强迫我二叔母将我母坟前玉茭数十棵割倒，以封建恶霸作风，报复私仇，破坏我人民政府奖励生产的政策。
    由于我对村干部的不满，我又无原则地乱讲：合作社是“共饭社”、“吃塌社”、“不成样子”。以此来打击村干部，拨挑干部与群众的关系。这是我的严重错误。
    我虽然出身贫农家庭，小时候也曾当过几年工徒，可是没受过较长期的劳动锻炼，旧社会的封建思想和小资产阶级的为个人打算的劣根性，还非常严重。因此，为了个人利益，我就失掉了无产阶级的立场，丧失了共产党员的品质，犯了严重的错误。我完全接受党报对我的批评，接受组织上给我的党纪制裁。我要加强学习，痛改前非，坚决为党为人民服务到底。
                                     路和富（现名路福和）
