Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Overseas Chinese returnees in various places have successively accused Japanese imperialism of torturing overseas Chinese and local people in Southeast Asia in the past, and have strongly protested against the conspiracy of American imperialism to re-arm Japan.

　　In Fuzhou, the Fujian Daily received many letters of accusation from returned overseas Chinese. Huang Shuying, a returnee from Singapore, wrote: "When the Japanese bandits occupied Malaya, they massacred tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Changi, Katong, and Hougang in Singapore alone. They tied the hands of overseas Chinese with iron wires, bound them in groups of dozens, and then used machine guns to strafe them or pushed them into the sea."

　　In Xiamen, Chen Daoping, a returnee from the Philippines, accused: "In the Philippines, the Japanese bandits buried 625 overseas Chinese alive in Shantabawen Lushe in one day. In Iloilo City, more than 300 overseas Chinese were collectively driven to the highway by the Japanese bandits. The men were stabbed to death with bayonets, the women were raped and burned with gasoline, and the children were thrown into the air and then stabbed with bayonets for fun. In Manila, more than 3,000 overseas Chinese and Filipinos were also brutally murdered in this way."

　　In Haikou City, Hainan Island, returned overseas Chinese held a rally on the 13th to oppose the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism. Overseas Chinese who returned from Thailand accused American imperialism of instructing the Thai reactionary government to persecute overseas Chinese, just as the Japanese bandits did before. Lin Mingfei, who had lived in Midong in southern Thailand for more than ten years, after accusing the Japanese bandits of looting overseas Chinese shops and massacring overseas Chinese there, indignantly asked: "Now the United States wants to re-arm the enemy who killed our compatriots ten years ago; can't we see the hideous face of American imperialism clearly enough?"

　　In Guangzhou, more than 200 returned overseas Chinese held a similar rally on the 17th. Chen Miaoling, an overseas Chinese from Indonesia, accused: "During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the Japanese bandits captured my father, uncle, and grand-uncle, and after severe torture, buried them alive. I know they were buried with more than 2,000 other massacred overseas Chinese." Cai Shimin, a returnee from Burma, said: "The Japanese bandits conscripted men in Malaya, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, and escorted them to build a 'death railway' connecting Thailand and Burma; from 1942 to the beginning of 1945, more than 200,000 people of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia died on this railway, many of whom were overseas Chinese." Cai Shimin said: "Overseas Chinese will never forget the deep blood feud of being tortured and massacred by the Japanese bandits!" At the meeting, the returned overseas Chinese unanimously expressed their firm opposition to the fact that American imperialism is now re-arming the Japanese fascist aggressors whose hands are still stained with blood.

    控诉日寇摧残华侨
    抗议美帝国主义重新武装日本
    【新华社二十三日讯】各地归国华侨，纷纷控诉过去日本帝国主义在东南亚各地摧残华侨及当地人民的罪行，对美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋提出强烈的抗议。
    在福州，福建日报收到了很多归国华侨的控诉信。新加坡归侨黄淑英写道：“日寇占领马来亚时，仅在新加坡的漳宜、加东和后港等地，就集体屠杀了上万的华侨。他们用铁丝反绑侨胞们的双手，每几十人捆作一团，然后用机关枪扫射或将他们推入海中。”
    在厦门，菲律宾归侨陈道平控诉说：“在菲律宾，日寇曾在汕巴汶落社一天内活埋了华侨六百二十五人。怡朗市有一次有三百多华侨被日寇集体驱到公路上，男的被用刺刀戳死，女的被强奸后浇上汽油烧死，小孩被抛到空中然后用刺刀迎刺取乐。在马尼拉有三千多名华侨和菲律宾人也被这样残酷地屠杀。”
    在海南岛海口市、归国侨胞于十三日举行了反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的集会。自泰国归来的侨胞指责美帝国主义已像以前日寇一样地指使泰国反动政府迫害华侨。曾在泰国南部密洞居留十多年的林明飞，在控诉了日寇洗劫该地华侨商店、惨杀侨胞的暴行后，愤慨地问道：“现在美国又要把十年前杀过我们同胞的敌人武装起来了；美帝国主义的狰狞面目我们还看不清楚吗？”
    在广州，归国侨胞二百多人于十七日举行了同样的集会。印尼华侨陈妙玲控诉说：“日寇在占领印尼期间，捕去我的父亲和伯父、叔父，经过严刑拷打后又把他们活埋了。我知道他们是和二千多名被惨杀的侨胞埋在一起的。”缅甸归侨蔡时敏说：“日寇曾在马来亚、越南、泰国和缅甸抓丁，押去建筑一条贯通泰国和缅甸的‘死亡铁路’；从一九四二年到一九四五年初，死在这条铁路上的东南亚各族人民有二十多万人，其中有许多是华侨。”蔡时敏说：“华侨永远也不会忘记遭受日寇摧残屠杀的血海深仇！”会上，归国侨胞们对于美帝国主义现在又要重新武装双手血迹未干的日本法西斯侵略者，一致表示坚决反对。
