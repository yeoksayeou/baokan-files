Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 25th: The World Peace Council meeting on the 23rd continued to discuss the report by Councilor Fache, a member of the Executive Bureau, on resolving the issues of Germany and Japan peacefully.

　　In the morning session, the first to speak was Fink, the secretary of the Hamburg dockworkers' union and a representative of Germany. He listed specific examples of West German remilitarization and described the development of the mass movement of the West German people against remilitarization. Fink stated that the German people's desire for peace, their efforts to achieve German unification, and their efforts to establish understanding with the people of all countries have been expressed in resolutions passed at numerous meetings and gatherings. Signatures against remilitarization are being collected in various enterprises in West Germany, and a large-scale movement is underway to support the proposal by German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl and the Republic's People's Chamber to establish an all-German constitutional assembly. Fink concluded by assuring the World Peace Council on behalf of the peace advocates and the Provisional Committee Against Remilitarization in the West German states that the peace fighters in West Germany would do their utmost to maintain peace.

　　Pitcher, the General Secretary of the British Tobacco Workers' Union, followed, stating that the ordinary workers in Britain had realized that the struggle to increase wages, reduce working hours, and improve living conditions was inseparable from the struggle for peace. British workers have come to understand that the Soviet people are living a happy socialist life and are engaged in grand peaceful construction. British workers sincerely hope to establish the most friendly relations with the Soviet people and support the German people's struggle for unification.

　　Soviet Bishops Nikolai of Krutitsy and Kolomna, in his speech, condemned the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea and called for intensified efforts in the struggle for peace.

　　German representative, Professor Herz, a theology professor at Leipzig University, urged all Christians to actively fight to maintain world peace. He pointed out that despite the demarcation of the occupied zones in Germany, the German Evangelical Church is united in defending peace. Herz advocated the immediate implementation of the proposals made by German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl and the Republic's People's Chamber to restore German unity.

　　New Zealand representative, Reverend Chandler, firmly opposed the remilitarization of Japan on behalf of the New Zealand people.

　　Brazilian representative Posari, in his speech on the various treaties that bind the governments of Latin American countries to American imperialism, said that the United States uses this subordinate relationship to pass any resolutions it desires through the United Nations General Assembly. However, the people of Latin America are fighting for peace and freedom. He pointed out that the current primary tasks of the people of Latin American countries are to oppose sending troops to Korea, oppose handing over military bases to foreign countries, oppose supplying raw materials to warmongers, and strive for a United Nations policy that meets the national interests of each Latin American country.

　　Australian representative Street stated that the World Peace Congress must arouse public opinion and demand that the United Nations be restored as an independent organization and fulfill the various functions upon which it was founded.

　　Italian representative Pajetta reported on the struggle of Italian peace fighters against turning Italy into an American military base and stated that the Italian people had found the road to peace and were marching along with us. The fog of lies that separated many people from us has begun to dissipate. The widespread response of the Italian people to Stalin's remarks is a convincing piece of evidence. Pajetta finally urged everyone to fight for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

　　In the afternoon session, Peter Woodard read a letter from Christopher Woodard, a British representative who had attended the Second World Peace Congress, which pointed out that the British people were deeply moved by the paramount issue of peace or war. The British people are fully determined not to allow politicians to plunge them into war again. The idea of arming West Germany seems insane to everyone.

　　French National Assembly member Chamberlan, in his speech, pointed out that the French government's pursuit of a despicable policy closely linked to the adventures of the American imperialists, the defeat of the American aggressor troops in Korea, and the undeniable success of the peace movement have led countless French citizens to believe that severing ties with the North Atlantic Alliance is the most correct way to avoid disaster.

　　Polish representative Professor Infield condemned the criminal acts of American imperialism in invading Korea and Taiwan and pointed out that the United Nations has obviously increasingly become a tool of American aggressive policies. The people of the world will no longer place their hopes for defending peace on the bankrupt United Nations but will place them on their own growing forces for peace.

　　Italian representative Montezzi stated that many middle-class people in Italy were previously unaware of the situation and believed the warmongers' propaganda. However, now these blind people have regained their sight, and many deaf people have regained their hearing. New strata are constantly joining the peace movement among the Italian people. Honest and hardworking laborers have gradually paid attention to the voices of peace advocates.

　　Czechoslovakian representative Professor Gromaka urged the churches of all countries to clearly and unequivocally decide their positions on the Far East issue and the remilitarization of West Germany. They should frankly state who is creating the current tense situation in the Far East, who is preventing the new China, with its 500 million people, from participating in the United Nations, and who has ignored the hopes of the Asian people for many years. At the same time, the churches cannot remain silent on the issue of West German remilitarization.

　　Uruguayan representative, mathematician Macela, described the development of the South American people's movement to defend peace, stating that now, the activities of peace advocates in South America are increasing not only in cities and factories but also in villages where peace committees have not been established. The resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress have played a significant role in this regard.

　　Finnish representative Mairti reported that the Finnish peace movement is breaking through difficulties and developing widely among people of extremely different strata.

　　各国代表在和平理事会上发言
    一致反对武装西德日本
  　谴责美国非法操纵联合国进行侵略
  　呼吁为订立五大国和平公约而斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会二十三日会议继续讨论理事会执行局委员法奇所作关于以和平方式解决德国与日本问题的报告。
    在上午会议上首先发言的是德国代表、汉堡码头工人工会书记芬克，他列举了西德重新军国主义化的具体事例，并叙述了西德人民反对重新军国主义化的群众运动的发展情形。芬克称：德国人民要求和平的愿望、争取德国统一及争取与各国人民建立谅解的努力，已表现在许多次会议和集会上所通过的决议中。西德各企业中正在征集反对重新军国主义化的签名，并且展开了规模广大的运动，以支持德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥与共和国人民议会关于成立全德立宪会议的建议。芬克最后以西德各州的和平拥护者及反对重新军国主义化临时委员会的名义向世界和平理事会会议保证：西德的和平斗士一定要尽最大的努力来维护和平。
    英国烟草工人工会总书记皮契继起发言称：英国的普通工人已了解到争取增加工资、减少工作时间及改善生活状况的斗争，是和争取和平的斗争分不开的。英国工人已经了解苏联人民正过着社会主义的幸福生活而且进行着宏大的和平建设。英国工人非常希望和苏联人民建立最友好的关系，并支持德国人民要求统一的斗争。
    苏联克卢提柴与科罗姆纳主教尼古拉在发言中斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行，并呼吁加紧进行争取和平的斗争。
    德国代表、莱比锡大学神学教授赫兹牧师吁请所有的基督教徒积极为维持世界和平而斗争。他指出：尽管德国存在着占领区的界限，但德国福音教会在保卫和平方面却是一致的。赫兹主张立即实行德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥与共和国人民议会关于恢复德国统一的建议。
    新西兰代表张德勒牧师代表新西兰人民坚决反对日本重新军国主义化。
    巴西代表波萨里在发言中论及拉丁美洲各国政府受美帝国主义约束的各种条约时说：美国就利用这种从属关系来使联合国大会通过美国所希望的一切决议。但是拉丁美洲人民正在为和平与自由而斗争。他指出：为反对派遣军队前往朝鲜、反对把军事基地交给外国、反对以原料供给战争贩子、争取符合每个拉丁美洲国家的民族利益的联合国政策而斗争，是拉丁美洲国家人民当前首要的任务。
    澳大利亚代表斯崔特发言称：世界和平大会必须唤起舆论，要求把联合国恢复为独立的机构，执行其赖以建立的各种职务。
    意大利代表巴也塔报告了意大利和平斗士为反对把意大利变成为美国军事基地而进行的斗争，并称：意大利人民已经找到通向和平的道路，并且正在和我们一道迈进。把许多人和我们隔开的谎言之雾已经开始消散了。意大利人对斯大林的谈话的广泛响应就是一个令人信服的证据。巴也塔最后吁请大家为争取缔结五大国和平公约而斗争。
    在下午会议上，彼得·伍达德宣读了曾出席第二届世界和平大会的英国代表克里斯多夫·伍达德的一封信，其中指出：英国人民已因为和平或战争这个无上重要的问题而感到深深的激动。英国人民具有充分的决心，不让政客们再把他们投入战争。武装西德的这种思想在每一个人看来都是疯狂的。
    法国国民议会议员香贝朗在发言时指出：法国政府奉行与美帝国主义者的冒险政策密切联系的卑劣政策、美国侵略军在朝鲜的溃败、以及和平运动的不容置辩的成功，已使得无数的法国公民认为：与北大西洋联盟的政策断绝关系，才是避免灾祸的最正确的方法。
    波兰代表英费尔德教授斥责了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和台湾的罪恶行动后指出：联合国显然已越来越变成美国侵略政策的工具，全世界人民一定不再把保卫和平的期望寄托在破产了的联合国身上，而是要寄托在自己的日益增长的和平力量。
    意大利代表蒙特齐发言称：意大利的许多中等阶层的人士从前不明了时局，而相信战争贩子的宣传。但是，现在这些盲人都已恢复了他们的视力，许多聋子都已恢复了他们的听觉。在意大利人民中经常有新的阶层参加和平运动。诚实而劳苦的劳动人民已逐渐注意和平拥护者的声音了。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表格罗马卡教授促请各国基督教会在远东问题和西德重新军国主义化问题上必须清晰而且毫不含糊地决定他们的立场，他们应该坦白说明：是谁造成目前远东的紧张局势，是谁阻挠拥有五亿人口的新中国参加联合国，是谁许多年来对亚洲人民的希望置之不理。同时，教会对西德重新军国主义化问题也不能保持缄默。
    乌拉圭代表、数学家马塞拉叙述了南美洲人民保卫和平运动的发展情况称：现在，南美洲的和平拥护者的活动，不但在各城市和工厂，而且也在没有设立和平委员会的村庄中日益增强起来。第二届世界和平大会的决议在这方面起了很大的作用。
    芬兰代表麦尔蒂报告了芬兰和平运动正突破困难，在极不相同的各阶层人民中广泛开展的情形。
