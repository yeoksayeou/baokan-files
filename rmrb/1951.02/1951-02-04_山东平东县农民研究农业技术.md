    Shandong Pingdong County Farmers
    Studying Agricultural Techniques
    To the Editor:
    In mid-to-late December of last year, the Pingdong County People's Government, in coordination with the county's Construction Section, the county farm, and production assistants from the four districts, convened an agricultural technology research meeting in Lenggezhuang, a key township in the Fourth District. A total of 744 male and female farmers from nine villages (including 199 working women) gathered for three days to exchange production experiences and strengthen technical guidance. Everyone was in high spirits and generally made production plans. In the exchange of production experiences, farmers were most interested in fertilizer application methods, good farming practices, and pest and disease control. Zhang Delin from Yuanxi Village said, "What people say is absolutely right. This year, when I planted spring soybeans, I mixed dry ash, kang (heated brick bed) ash, and large circle manure and applied it to the soybean field. The soybeans grew very well, yielding 750 jin per mu. When planting in the autumn, I added ash again, and they grew even better, with large pods and shiny skins. This not only prevented diseases but also eliminated the grubs." Leng Shoujun said, "Our village has adopted the method of using urine to water wheat. Last year, Leng Shouqin used urine to water wheat and harvested 160 jin from 0.7 mu." At the conference, Feng Huichi from Fenggezhuang said, "It's not good to use urine to water peas in the winter. The ones I watered last winter all rotted. The ones I watered this spring only grew vines and no pods." Farmers studied these practical experiences and solved many problems. Everyone felt that this kind of meeting was very meaningful.

    山东平东县农民
    研究农业技术编辑同志：
    山东平东县人民政府于上年十二月中下旬，由县建设科、县农场配合四个区的生产助理员，在四区冷格庄重点乡，召开农业技术研究会，共集中了九个村的男女农民七四四人（内有劳动妇女一九九名），以三天的时间交流了生产经验并加强技术指导，大家情绪都很高涨，普遍订出了生产计划。在交流生产经验中，农民最感兴趣的是肥料的使用法、好的耕作法和病虫害的防除等。院西村张得林说：“人家说的一点也不差，我今年种春地豆子，用的干灰、炕洞土和大圈粪搅起来，上在豆子地里，豆子长的很好，每亩出产七百五十斤。秋天种时我又加上灰，长的更好，豆角大、豆皮发亮。这样不但不生病，还没有地蚕。”冷守均说：“俺村都接受了积尿浇麦子的办法，去年冷守琴使尿浇麦子，七分地打了一百六十斤”。大会交流经验时，逢格庄逢会池说：“冬天不好使尿浇豌豆，我去冬浇的都烂死了，今春浇的光长蔓子不长荚。”农民们研究了这些实际经验，解决了不少问题，大家认为这种会很有意义。
