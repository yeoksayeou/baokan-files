Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, February 21st (TASS): Dulles, Truman's special envoy, held negotiations with Australian Foreign Minister Spender and New Zealand Foreign Minister Doidge in Canberra from February 15th to 18th. According to foreign newspaper reports, these negotiations were conducted in great secrecy. The central issues of the negotiations were the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan, Japanese armament, and Japan's position in the aggressive Pacific alliance being arranged by the United States.

Dulles, who is touring the Pacific countries on a mission from Washington, wants to prepare these countries for the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan, in order to subsequently include Japan in the aggressive Pacific bloc manipulated by the United States.

It can be seen from foreign newspapers that Dulles's task is to eliminate the doubts felt by Australia and New Zealand regarding Japan's re-militarization and the restoration of Japan's war potential.

Judging from the joint communiqué issued as a result of the Canberra negotiations, Dulles, Spender, and Doidge have reached a consensus on the matter of including Japan in the infamous Pacific Pact. The communiqué stated: "The representatives of the three countries have made great contributions not only to a general understanding of the complex issues involved, but also to the solutions."

At the same time, the communiqué also had to admit: "There are some differences in the methods of dealing with the relevant issues."

Australian social figures have expressed anxiety and unease about these negotiations conducted behind the backs of the people. This anxiety is reflected in the bourgeois newspapers and in the statements of certain bourgeois politicians. For example, the Sydney *Sunday Sun* said that while some Americans believe that Japan has become a peace-loving democracy in the past five years, Australia does not consider this view to be truly credible.

Evatt, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the parliamentary opposition, said, referring to the Canberra talks: "We are being asked to consider reaching a possible agreement with a country that was our bitter enemy a few years ago, and to arm it as a guarantee against future aggression. Is this issue not being resolved too lightly?"

These remarks reflect the growing anxiety of the people of the Pacific countries due to the United States' feverish preparations to sign an illegal separate peace treaty with Japan and its intention to use the latter as a tool to realize its adventurous plans in the Far East.

　　杜勒斯与澳、新外长谈判结束
    阴谋使日本加入太平洋侵略公约
    澳社会人士对这种阴谋谈判表示焦虑不安
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社悉尼二十一日讯：杜鲁门的特使杜勒斯与澳大利亚外长斯宾德及新西兰外长多基的谈判，于二月十五日到十八日在堪培拉举行。据外国报纸的报道，这些谈判是在非常秘密中举行的。关于缔结单独的对日和约、日本的军备、以及日本在正由美国布置的侵略性的太平洋联盟中的地位问题，成为谈判的中心。
    奉了华盛顿的使命正在周游太平洋各国的杜勒斯，要使这些国家准备缔结单独的对日和约，以便随后使日本加入美国操纵下的侵略性的太平洋集团。
    从外国报纸中可以看见，杜勒斯的任务便是要消除澳大利亚和新西兰对于日本的重新军国主义化和恢复日本战争潜能所感到的疑虑。
    从作为堪培拉谈判的结果而发表的联合公报来判断，杜勒斯、斯宾德和多基，对于使日本加入臭名远扬的太平洋公约一事，意见已趋于一致。公报中说：“三国代表不仅对于有关的复杂问题的一般的了解上，而且对于解决办法上，都已作了很大的贡献。”
    同时，公报中也不得不承认：“在处理有关问题的方法上，是有些分歧的。”
    澳大利亚社会人士对于瞒着人民进行的这些谈判表示焦虑不安。这种焦虑不安的心理已反映在资产阶级的报纸中和某些资产阶级政治家的谈话中。例如，悉尼的《星期太阳报》说：某些美国人士以为在过去五年间日本已变成了一个爱好和平的民主国家，澳大利亚方面却不认为这种见解是确实可信的。
    议会反对派的工党副领袖伊瓦特，在提及堪培拉会谈时说：“人们要我们考虑与那个在几年前还是我们恶毒的敌人的国家达成可能的协议，并且把它武装起来作为防止未来侵略的一种保证。这个问题不是解决得太轻率了吗？”
    这些言论反映出：由于美国发热昏地准备签订非法的单独对日和约，并准备利用后者作为实现它在远东的冒险计划的工具，太平洋各国的人民已日益感到焦虑不安。
