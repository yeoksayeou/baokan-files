　　Comforting Chinese and Korean Soldiers and Relieving Korean Refugees
    Donation Campaigns Reach a Climax Across Regions
    [Report from this newspaper] Responding to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, people in North China, Central and Southern China, and Northwest China are enthusiastically launching donation campaigns to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces and relieve Korean refugees.
            North China Regions
    Comfort campaigns are rapidly unfolding in Beijing, Tianjin, and other parts of North China. In the capital, teachers, students, and staff at institutions such as Renmin University of China, the Central Academy of Drama, the National No. 1 Midwifery School, the Party School of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the North China People's Revolutionary University, the Beijing Russian Language School, the Winter Training Class of the State-owned Farm of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Meteorological Cadre Training Class of the Meteorological Bureau of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Cadre Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Physician Training Class of Peking University Medical College, the employees of Xinhua Bookstore headquarters, the staff of the nursery of Xinhua News Agency and the forty-six children in its kindergarten, as well as thirty students staying at Yenching University, ninety-six boarding students at the Municipal No. 1 Middle School, and nineteen students on leave from the Huadaogou Student Sanatorium due to lung disease, are enthusiastically donating money and goods. According to incomplete statistics, the above units have donated more than 45 million yuan, and more than 2,000 items including overcoats, blankets, cotton-padded clothes and trousers, sweaters, woolen garments, bedding, shoes and socks, scarves, cotton hats, watches, gold rings, and fountain pens. In addition, there are more than 3,000 jin of millet. The staff and some students of the Party School of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the North China People's Revolutionary University alone (the vast majority of new students have not yet enrolled) donated more than 20,067,900 yuan and 214 pieces of clothing and valuables. A small group of the Central Academy of Drama's orchestra wrote a song, "Raging Tide of the Yalu River," dedicated to the Chinese and Korean People's fighters. The mothers of the faculty and staff of the academy, concerned about the suffering Korean children, donated their own children's cotton clothes. Wang Renting, a student of the Meteorological Cadre Training Class, donated individually an overcoat, a sweater, a woolen garment, and a short cotton-padded coat, as well as scarves, socks, etc., worth about 600,000 yuan. Mai Duoling, a student at Renmin University of China, donated all 400,000 yuan of her dowry given by her father. Yi Xiaomei, a reader from Beijing, sent a letter to this newspaper with a payment of 1 million yuan, entrusting this newspaper to transfer it to the heroic Korean people. In the letter, he said: "This 1 million yuan was left to us by my mother, who passed away not long ago. My mother worked hard all her life to raise us, and she dedicated her children to the Party and the Communist Youth League. She was extremely frugal in her lifetime, saving every penny to leave to us in order to keep us warm. In response to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, I hereby dedicate this money to the Korean mothers and their children to keep them warm. I think, if my mother were alive, she would definitely want me to do this."
    Each workshop team of the Tianjin Railway Administration launched a donation campaign on January 17. Many employees couldn't wait to discuss donation methods and immediately took out their wallets to donate. Less than 100 members of each team of the Transportation Department Branch donated more than 1 million yuan in less than an hour. Other branches also competed to donate, fearing being left behind. Under the leadership of the workers in the evaporation room of the Dagu branch of Tianjin Chemical Plant, all employees of the factory launched a donation campaign. By January 24, a total of 1,300,750 yuan had been donated.
    The donation campaign of industry and commerce circles in Shijiazhuang City to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces and relieve Korean refugees is rapidly entering a climax. As of 9 p.m. on the 22nd of last month, according to incomplete statistics from 24 industries, the amount of donations pledged had exceeded 45 million yuan, and 50 more industries would soon report their figures.
    Industry and commerce circles in Zhaogezhuang, Qitang District, Tangshan, actively donated comfort goods and relief funds. As of January 19, a total of 8,528,000 yuan had been raised.
    The China Coal Mine Workers School in Qinhuangdao established a fundraising committee on January 16. Sun Yanquan, a coal miner working underground in the Xinbo Coal Mine who was studying at the school, said: "I have tasted the bitterness of hunger and cold under the rule of Japanese imperialism. I will not only take off my coat for the Korean brothers to wear, but also guarantee to study culture hard at school, improve my skills, and intensify production to support the front after returning to the mine." Lei Xianghe, a loading and unloading worker at Tanggu Wharf, donated the new cotton trousers that his family had just mailed to him. In less than a day, the entire school donated a total of 3,430,000 yuan and more than 120 pieces of clothing and bedding.
    All the students of the Tianjin Railway Administration Political Training Class in Tong County and the Hebei Provincial Tong County Women's Normal School actively donated money and goods. Eighteen people in the Railway Administration Political Training Class donated 150,000 yuan and many pieces of cotton shoes and clothing. Many students of the Women's Normal School expressed their determination to donate generously. For example, Guo Shuqing donated her only quilt, and all the students in Class C of the Third Grade passed a one- or two-meter saving campaign. The school's comfort and relief campaign is underway.
    On the morning of January 16, all cadres and policemen of the Zhangjiakou Public Security Section saw the newspaper publishing the notice of January 14. After discussion and study of the editorial in the newspaper that day, they immediately launched a donation campaign on the spot. All twenty-three people donated a total of 1,020,000 yuan. They also said: "This little bit of money is intended as a small comfort to the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the suffering people of Korea. In the future, we will actively work and eliminate bandits and special agents with practical actions to support the heroic Chinese and Korean People's soldiers and the Korean people."
    All the employees of Baotou Grain Company donated 1,150,000 yuan in one hour during the study time on the morning of January 20. Without exception, all service personnel considered donating as an honor. In addition to donating 170,000 yuan, the employees of the company's accounting department also proposed to respond to this call with practical work.

In her letter of sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, she said: I donate the 50,000 yuan I prepared for the children to celebrate the Lunar New Year to you. Please enjoy the Spring Festival happily, drive all the American robbers into the sea, avenge the Korean people and avenge my dead husband. All the employees of the Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory where He Zhenzhong, a national model worker who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, worked, in addition to donating 1.2 million yuan and ten dozen towels, unanimously passed a resolution to work overtime voluntarily for half a day every Sunday morning and donate the processing fee to the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers.
