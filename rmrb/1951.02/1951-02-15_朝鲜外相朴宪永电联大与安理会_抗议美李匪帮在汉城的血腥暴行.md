Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 13th: Park Hun-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram on the 10th to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, protesting the bloody atrocities of the American-Syngman Rhee gang in Seoul.

The telegram pointed out: During the temporary occupation of Seoul and its surrounding areas, a total of 43,590 local people were killed or died as a result of torture. More than 75,000 people were arrested, filling all the prisons, factory warehouses, and church basements. According to incomplete statistics, more than 28,800 of these arrested people were killed. In addition, thousands of people starved to death. When the Americans retreated from Seoul, they brought out more than 30,000 people from several prisons and drove them to southern Korea. On the way, they shot and killed more than 10,000 of them.

The telegram continued: In Seoul and its surrounding areas, the American aggressors and their servant, the Syngman Rhee gang, frequently searched for women late at night. Many of them were raped and then brutally murdered. The American bandits revived the barbaric torture of scalping. In Seoul, there were twelve cases of Korean patriots being scalped by American executioners. Before fleeing Seoul, the American aggressors looted the property of the Korean people and did their best to destroy everything they could not take away. Eighty percent of the houses in Seoul were destroyed or burned, and some areas were razed to the ground. The Americans removed machinery from hundreds of factories in Seoul and blew up or burned 785 enterprises. They destroyed all higher education institutions, the buildings, equipment, and libraries of 70 secondary schools and 160 people's schools, and plundered and transported more than 500 historically valuable treasures from the National Museum and the Folk Museum. They also carried out terrible destruction of other museums, and the Science Museum was destroyed and burned to ashes.

The telegram exposed the American-Syngman Rhee gang's forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents in Seoul and its suburbs to the south. These residents were strafed by American aircraft on the way. In the American-occupied areas, many patriotic Korean people were executed without trial, and men between the ages of seventeen and forty were forcibly conscripted into the army.

After listing many specific facts of the atrocities committed by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, the telegram stated: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demands that the atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea under the flag of the United Nations be stopped, and that the war criminals who organized and directed these atrocities be punished.

　　朝鲜外相朴宪永电联大与安理会        
    抗议美李匪帮在汉城的血腥暴行
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于十日致电联合国大会主席与安全理事会主席，抗议美李匪帮在汉城的血腥暴行。
    电文指出：在汉城及其附近地区暂时沦陷期间，当地人民被杀害的和因酷刑致死的共达四万三千五百九十人。被捕的有七万五千余人，挤满了所有的监狱、工厂仓库和教堂的地下室。据不完全的统计，在这些被捕的人们中，有二万八千八百余人被杀害。此外，有数千人被饿死。美国人从汉城溃逃时，他们从几处的狱中共提出三万余人，驱往朝鲜南部。在途中，竟又枪杀了其中的一万余人。
    电文继指出：美国侵略者及其仆从李承晚匪帮在汉城及附近地区，时常在深夜搜捕妇女。其中很多人在被强奸后，又惨遭屠杀。美国匪徒们恢复了剥头皮的野蛮酷刑。在汉城，朝鲜爱国分子被美国刽子手剥去头皮的事件有十二起。美国侵略者在逃出汉城前，大肆掠夺朝鲜人民的财产，尽力破坏他们所不能带走的一切东西。汉城百分之八十的住宅都被破坏或烧毁，若干地区已被夷为平地。美国人从汉城运走数百所工厂的机器，炸毁或烧去七百八十五所企业。他们摧毁了全部高等教育机关、七十所中等学校和一百六十所人民学校的建筑、设备和图书馆，从国立博物馆和民族博物馆掠夺并运走五百多件具有历史价值的宝物。他们对其他博物馆也施行可怕的破坏，科学博物馆已被破坏并被烧成灰烬。
    电文揭露美李匪帮把汉城及其郊区的数十万居民强迫驱向南方。这些居民在路上，却遭到美国飞机的扫射。在美军侵占区内，对许多爱国的朝鲜人民不加审讯即予枪决，从十七岁到四十岁的男子均被强征入伍。
    电文在列举了美、李匪帮暴行的许多具体事实后称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求制止美国侵略者在联合国旗帜下在朝鲜所犯的暴行，并对组织与指导这些暴行的战争罪犯加以惩办。
