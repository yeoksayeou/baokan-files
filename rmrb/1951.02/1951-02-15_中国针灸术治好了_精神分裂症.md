　　Editor's note: Comrade Ma Jianxing's suggestion that our medical community should pay attention to the research and promotion of acupuncture therapy is worthy of attention. He has sent two letters to this newspaper on this issue. We immediately forwarded his first letter to the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government for research. This is his second letter, and we believe it is necessary to publish it to attract widespread attention so that acupuncture therapy, one of the valuable heritages of Chinese medicine, can be systematically researched and promoted.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor:

　　Although I do not understand medicine, I have a firsthand fact that I would like to provide for reference and research to medical workers across the country.

　　Diseases of the nervous system have always been a complex problem, and both Chinese and Western medicine find them difficult to handle. I have a friend named Yang Xiurong, who was originally a student at Yenching University. In August 1947, she dropped out of school due to spinal tuberculosis. In April 1949, after undergoing surgery at Renji Hospital in Shanghai, she was injected with more than 60 doses of streptomycin. The tuberculosis was cured, and she was just able to get out of bed when she was found to have numbness throughout her body, appearing listless all day long. After consultations with many famous doctors in Shanghai, such as Han Fen (Australian), Su Zonghua, and at the Puti Sanatorium and the Red Cross Hospital, she was unanimously diagnosed with "schizophrenia" and deemed "untreatable." The situation worsened. From January to May 1950, she gradually progressed from lying still with her eyes closed all day long, not eating, not speaking, not moving, and even her bowel movements stopped, with only her heart beating and lungs breathing.

　　In a situation of utter hopelessness, in mid-July last year, I sent her to Beijing. I also consulted several neurologists, and the conclusion was "no solution!"

　　Finally, I found Comrade Zhu Lian of the Ministry of Health (Deputy Director of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau). She has been researching Chinese acupuncture for many years and had also cured my father's facial nerve paralysis. In late July, we carried the patient to her dormitory. When she saw this emaciated, corpse-like patient, she immediately asked in detail about the course of the illness. Then, she first checked the patient's blood pressure, heart, and lungs. She said, "The heart itself is not diseased, but the neurotic arrhythmia is very serious." She thought carefully for several minutes and then said, "Before I can be certain of a cure, I must first test with acupuncture." We agreed. So, she first inserted a needle into her abdomen, opened the patient's eyes to observe, and then inserted a needle on each side of the corner of her mouth. Then, she gently pressed the patient's jaw, and the patient's mouth opened. She nodded and said: I can try to treat it, but it will take three to five months of regular acupuncture. The first stage is to enable the patient to have bowel movements automatically, the second stage is to enable the patient to move and eat automatically, and the third stage is to restore speech function. At this time, she asked us to remove the steel-reinforced corset from the patient and told us many nursing methods. After that, Comrade Xu Shiqian, a student of Comrade Zhu Lian, performed the acupuncture. Half a month later, the patient's condition improved day by day. The therapeutic effects of the three stages were gradually realized. Now, not only has the patient's diet and movement returned to normal, but her mental capacity is also slowly recovering. She can play chess, write letters, and keep a diary. Even more surprisingly, her speech function has also begun to recover. This proves that my friend's "schizophrenia" has a definite hope of being completely eliminated, and it is not "hopeless."

　　I raise this issue not to criticize certain Western doctors or experts, but to say that acupuncture is a unique technique in Chinese medicine. As far as I know, Comrade Zhu Lian and Comrade Xu Shiqian have many actual cases on hand. I hope that the Chinese medical community can pay attention to this issue and promote and study it widely.

### 中国针灸术治好了“精神分裂症”

　　中国针灸术治好了“精神分裂症”
    编者按：马健行同志所提出的关于我国医学界应该注意研究与推广针灸医疗法的问题，是值得重视的。他为了这个问题，已两次寄信给本报，我们接到他的第一次信，曾立即转交中央人民政府卫生部研究。这是他的第二封信，我们认为有必要公布出来，引起广泛的注意，使我国医学的宝贵遗产之一——针灸医疗法，能够有系统地被研究与推广起来。
                                                        编辑同志：
    我虽不懂得医学，但我有一个亲见的事实，愿意提供给全国医务工作者参考研究。
    神经系统的疾病，一向是个复杂的问题，中、西医都感到棘手；我有一个朋友叫杨秀容，她原来是燕京大学的学生，一九四七年八月因为患脊椎结核症就辍学了。一九四九年四月间在上海仁济医院施行手术后，又注射了六十多针连霉素，结核症已告痊愈，刚刚可以起床时，竟发现她全身麻木，终日呆若木鸡，经上海许多名医如韩芬（澳籍）、粟宗华及普慈疗养院、红十字会医院等处诊视，一致诊断是“精神分裂症”，认为“无法治疗”，情况愈演愈烈。一九五○年一月到五月间，逐渐由终日闭目静卧、不食、不语、不动，甚至连大小便都停顿了，仅有心脏跳动和肺部呼吸。
    在毫无希望的情况下，于去年七月中旬我把她送到北京，也找过几位神经科大夫，结论是“无办法！”
    最后，找到中央卫生部朱琏同志（妇幼卫生局副局长），他研究中国针灸已有多年的历史，也曾治好过我父亲的颜面神经麻痹。在七月下旬我们把病人抬到她宿舍，当她看到这位骨瘦如柴形若僵尸的病人，她立刻详细问了病的经过，接着就先检查病人的血压和心脏、肺脏等处，她说：“心脏本身倒没病变，就是神经性不正脉很严重。”她慎重地思考了几十分钟又说：“有没有把握治，首先用针刺试验一下。”我们同意了，于是她先在腹部扎进一针，将病人眼睛拨开察观了一下，又在口角两旁各进一针，再轻压病人的下颔，病人的口就张开了，她点了点头说：可以试治，不过要在三个月至五个月的时间内经常的针灸第一阶段达到病人能自动大小便，第二阶段达到病人能动作与自动饮食，第三阶段达到恢复言语机能。这时她要我们把病人身上的钢夹背心去掉，又告诉我们许多护理的方法，此后就由朱琏同志的学生许式谦同志进行针灸。半月以后，病况一天比一天好转了。那三个阶段的治疗效果，逐步地实现。现在病人不仅饮食、行动恢复了正常，而且脑力也慢慢恢复起来，能下棋、写信、记日记了。更可惊奇的是她的言语机能也开始在恢复了。由此证明，我这朋友的“精神分裂症”完全消释是有肯定的希望了，并不是“没办法”。
    我提出这个问题，并不是指责某些西医、专家，而是说，针灸是中国医学上特有的一种技术，据我所知，朱琏同志和许式谦同志手头所存实际病例很多，我希望中国的医学界能注意到这个问题，加以普遍推广与研究。
