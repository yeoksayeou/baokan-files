    Nanchang University Secretary-General Wei Dongming
    Should Not Violate Railway Regulations
To the Editor:
    On January 18th, Wei Dongming, Secretary-General of Nanchang University, traveled on ordinary passenger train No. 159 from Chang to Zhu (Nanchang to Zhuzhou) for business. When the train arrived at Pingxiang Station, he got off the train outside the station. When boarding the train, the ticket inspector at Pingxiang Station wanted to check his ticket, but he refused. After he boarded the train, the ticket inspector went to check his ticket again, but he still ignored him; later, his guard even drew a gun to threaten the ticket inspector. This action, which violated railway regulations, caused the train to be delayed by fifteen minutes.
    Checking passenger tickets is the duty of the people's railway ticket inspectors. Wei Dongming, as a cadre, should understand this. However, he not only violated the people's railway regulations and refused the ticket inspector's request to check his ticket, but also failed to stop his guard's illegal act of threatening people with a gun. This is a serious mistake. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will educate Wei Dongming and ask him to make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

### 南昌大学秘书长魏东明  不应违犯铁道规章

    南昌大学秘书长魏东明
    不应违犯铁道规章编辑同志：
    南昌大学秘书长魏东明在一月十八日因事乘昌株（南昌到株州）普通客车一五九次车外出。在火车到萍乡车站时，他下车到站外。上车时，萍乡站检票员要查票，他不让查。他上车后，检票员又去查票，他仍置之不理；后来，他的警卫员竟拔枪威吓检票员。这种违反铁道规章的行动，造成了该车延误十五分钟的晚点事故。
    检验乘客车票是人民铁道检票员的职责。魏东明身为干部，应该懂得这一点。但他不但违反人民铁道规章，拒绝检票员查票；且又对其警卫员拔枪胁人的不法行动不加制止。这是一个严重的错误。希望有关机关对魏东明进行教育，并让他在报上作公开检讨。
