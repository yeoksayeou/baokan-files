　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from TASS: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 21st and the morning of the 22nd, discussing the report by Mr. Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, on the implementation of the program of the Second Peace Congress. It also heard the report by Mr. Farge, member of the Executive Bureau and Chairman of the French Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom, on the remilitarization of Germany and Japan.

　　At the afternoon session on the 21st, Johnson, the Vice-Dean of Canterbury, England, spoke first, stating that the British people are beginning to understand who is preparing for a new war and what preparations for war will bring to the people of Britain and other European countries. The British people hate a new war, and if they knew the motives of their political leaders and the truth about the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and Korea, their hatred would be a thousand times stronger. Referring to Stalin's remarks to a reporter from Pravda, Johnson declared that war is currently avoidable. However, if we allow ourselves to fall into a web of lies, we may be dragged into war. War becomes possible in an atmosphere of lies, but where truth prevails, peace can be maintained. Johnson concluded by urging peace advocates to work actively to ensure world peace and lay the foundation for the sincere friendship of people of all countries.

　　D'Arboussier, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and representative of Africa, described the implementation of the Second World Peace Congress's resolution on colonies and dependent countries. He emphasized the importance of this issue, saying that these countries have a population of over 800 million, and the imperialists consider them important strategic bases and sources of raw materials. Therefore, the participation of the people of these countries in the struggle for peace is extremely important to the world peace movement. But to achieve this, they must be convinced that only peace can truly satisfy their vital interests. When they rise up against infringements on their rights, against the plundering of their national wealth, and demand national industrialization, they are also fighting for peace. Their struggle for the right to freely express their will is linked to the struggle of people of all countries for peace, and therefore, this struggle needs our support. D'Arboussier continued by saying that the people of these countries are now launching a movement against participating in any war of aggression, a situation that is now characteristic of every colony and dependent country, which is of great importance for expanding the peace movement in these countries. The main task at present is to widely explain that peace is a decisive factor in realizing their right to freely express their will. D'Arboussier finally expressed his confidence that the current meeting will take measures to ensure that the people of colonies and dependent countries can participate more widely and more actively in the struggle to defend peace.

　　Professor Dymbovsky, the Polish representative, reported on the Polish people's solidarity with the German people in their struggle against the rearmament of West Germany, and their sympathy with the German people's desire to resolve the German question peacefully and to unify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis.

　　Bouchama, the Algerian representative, pointed out the rapid growth of the peace movement in colonies and dependent countries. He specifically mentioned the establishment of a peace committee in Egypt, as well as peace demonstrations in Algeria and other countries in North Africa.

　　The famous German poet Becher said that the greatest wish of the German people is peace, and only a peace-loving Germany can unfold happy prospects for its people. Peace is the supreme law of the German nation's survival. Becher said that German intellectuals must recognize that every concession to American interventionist policies in the cultural field is a betrayal. He sharply criticized the West German "Bonn government" for refusing to accept the proposal of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, on German unification, and hoped that the World Peace Council would facilitate the realization of all-German negotiations. Becher emphasized that the scale of the German people's movement for peace and national unity is growing, and requested the Peace Council to support the German people's demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

　　At the morning session on the 22nd, after Cruz, the Philippine representative, spoke, Mr. Kokalis, a member of the World Peace Council and representative of Greece, continued to speak, ruthlessly exposing the conspiracy of the American imperialists to use Greece and Yugoslavia to provoke the people's democratic countries. Kokalis continued to report on the Greek people's struggle for peace, stating that although the Greek royalist fascist government closed down the only newspaper, Democratic News, that published news of the peace movement, the campaign to collect signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal is continuing throughout the country. Peace fighters have launched a campaign in the Greek countryside to publicize the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. Greek patriots sentenced to death and many soldiers in the Greek army have enthusiastically signed the Peace Appeal. Kokalis emphasized that the repressive measures of the royalist fascist government cannot scare the people. Macedonian railway workers have refused to handle war materials transported to the Tito clique, and slogans defending peace are appearing more and more on walls everywhere. The Greek people will stand with the great Soviet people and fulfill their duty to defend peace to the end.

　　Academician Obalin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences exposed the activities of the American, British, and French imperialists in expanding armaments and arming West Germany and Japan, and talked about the Soviet Union's vigorous peace-building efforts. Obalin emphasized that the Second World Peace Congress has pointed out the correct path for the struggle to defend peace, which is to immediately and substantially reduce armaments and prohibit the manufacture and use of any weapons of mass destruction. The people of the whole world, especially the people of Germany and Japan, must not allow the remilitarization of Germany and Japan, and must strive for the rapid realization of the historic resolution of the Warsaw Congress.

　　The meeting continued to hear Farge's report on the remilitarization of Germany and Japan.

　　世界和平理事会会议
　  热烈讨论南尼报告
　  一致表示各国人民决心维护和平反对德国和日本重新军国主义化
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社消息：世界和平理事会在二十一日下午和二十二日上午继续开会，讨论了世界和平理事会执行局副主席南尼所作关于第二届和平大会纲领执行情况的报告，并听取了执行局委员、法国争和平自由战士协会主席法奇所作关于德国与日本重新军国主义化的报告。
    在二十一日下午会议上，英国坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊首先发言称：英国人民正开始了解谁在准备新战争，备战将给英国及其他欧洲国家的人民带来什么。英国人民痛恨新战争，如果他们知道自己的政治领袖们的动机，和关于苏联、东欧、中国及朝鲜的真相，他们的憎恨就会强烈一千倍。约翰逊在谈及斯大林对真理报记者发表的谈话时宣称：目前战争是可以避免的。但是，如果我们让自己堕入谎言的罗网，我们就可能被拖入战争。在谎言的气氛中战争就成为可能，但在真理占优势的地方，和平是能够维护的。约翰逊最后敦促和平拥护者积极工作，以确保世界和平并为世界各国人民的真挚友谊奠定基础。
    世界和平理事会执行局副主席、非洲代表达波赛叙述了第二届世界和平大会关于殖民地和附属国的决议的执行情形。他强调指出这个问题的重要性称：这些国家拥有八亿以上的人口，帝国主义者认为这是它们重要的战略基地和原料的来源地。因此，这些国家的人民参加争取和平的斗争对于世界和平运动极端重要。但要做到这一点，必须使他们相信只有和平才能真正满足他们的切身利益。当他们起来反对侵犯他们的权利、反对掠夺他们国家的财富和要求国家工业化的时候，他们也就是为争取和平而斗争。他们争取自由表达意志的权利的斗争是和各国人民争取和平的斗争联系着的，因此，这一斗争需要我们的支持。达波赛继称：这些国家的人民现在正展开反对参加任何侵略战争的运动，这种情况现在是每个殖民地和附属国的特点，对于在这些国家内扩展和平运动有极大重要性。当前的主要任务是广泛进行解释，说明和平对于实现他们自由表达意志的权利是一个决定性的因素。达波赛最后表示信心说：本届会议将要采取措施，以保证殖民地和附属国人民能够更广泛而且更积极地参加保卫和平事业的斗争。
    波兰代表第姆鲍夫斯基教授报告了波兰人民声援德国人民反对重新武装西德的斗争，同情德国人民要求以和平方式解决德国问题及在和平、民主的基础上统一德国的愿望。
    阿尔及利亚代表布夏马指出了殖民地与附属国的和平运动迅速壮大的情形。他特别说到了埃及建立和平委员会，以及阿尔及利亚和北非其他国家的和平示威。
    德国名诗人贝契尔发言称：德国人民的最大愿望是和平，只有爱好和平的德国才能为它的人民展开幸福的前景。和平是德国民族生存的最高法则。贝契尔说：德国知识分子必须认识到：在文化领域中对于美国干涉主义政策的每一让步都是叛变。他尖锐地批评了西德“波恩政府”拒绝接受德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥关于德国统一的建议，并希望世界和平理事会促成全德谈判的实现。贝契尔强调指出德国人民争取和平与国家统一运动的规模已愈来愈大，并请求和平理事会支持德国人民关于在一九五一年缔结对德和约的要求。
    在二十二日上午会议上，菲律宾代表柯鲁兹发言后，世界和平理事会理事、希腊代表科卡利斯继起发言，无情地揭露了美帝国主义企图利用希腊、南斯拉夫对人民民主国家挑衅的阴谋。科卡利斯继报告希腊人民争取和平的斗争称：尽管希腊保皇法西斯政府封闭了唯一登载和平运动消息的报纸民主报，但是为斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集签名的运动正继续在全国进行着。和平斗士们已在希腊乡村发动了宣传第二届世界和平大会决议的运动。被判处死刑的希腊爱国者以及希腊军队中的许多士兵都在和平宣言上踊跃签名。科卡利斯强调称：保皇法西斯政府的镇压手段是吓不倒人民的。马其顿铁路工人已拒绝处置运交铁托集团的战争物资，各地的墙壁上愈来愈多地出现了保卫和平的口号。希腊人民将与伟大的苏联人民站在一起，把他们保卫和平的职责执行到底。
    苏联科学院院士奥巴林揭露了美、英、法帝国主义者扩张军备和武装西德及日本的活动，并谈及苏联大力进行和平建设的情形。奥巴林强调称：第二届世界和平大会已经为保卫和平的斗争指出了正确的道路，这就是立即大量裁减军备并禁止制造与使用任何大规模毁灭人类的武器。全世界人民首先是德国和日本的人民决不能允许德国和日本重新军国主义化，而且必须力争华沙大会的历史性决议的迅速实现。
    会议继续听取了法奇所作关于德国与日本重新军国主义化的报告。
