Comrade Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and Committee Members:

　　The issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is a matter of great concern to the people of the entire nation. In the past period, because we have not effectively implemented the policy of combining suppression with leniency as stipulated in Article 7 of the Common Program, a tendency towards excessive leniency has occurred in many places, which has aroused dissatisfaction among people of all strata towards the People's Government.

　　The people have criticized us for being "boundlessly lenient" and "having no law of heaven," saying, "They fear neither heaven nor earth, only the Communist Party's leniency," and "The People's Government is good in every way, except for being so polite to bad people, watching them harm the common people, and not standing up for the common people, which is not good." Some workers, filled with righteous indignation, questioned the cadres, saying, "Look! We competed for months, and a special agent destroyed it all with a single fire; if we don't suppress them, we won't compete anymore." Some said, "The government is asleep," "not even distinguishing between friend and foe." Some people said the government was "condoning evil and harming the people," "it doesn't even look like a people's government."

　　The people are fair and intelligent. The people praised the efforts in resisting America and aiding Korea, the land reform, the stabilization of prices and finance, and the urban management and democratic facilities as being very good, but they believed that the treatment of counter-revolutionary elements was too lenient. Indeed, we have not done very well in this regard in the past, and in some places, we did very poorly for a period of time. Especially after the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the problem became even clearer.

　　At that time, the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, bandits, and other remaining counter-revolutionary forces thought that the time for their dream of "World War III, counter-attack on the mainland" had arrived, and that the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek were about to return to restore their rule. They arrogantly tore off their usual masks of "pretending to repent," and emerged from their underground, covert activities to carry out various blatant acts of sabotage, openly attacking the people. Incidents of special agents and bandits plotting to sabotage railway bridges, destroy factories and mines, burn warehouses and assets, openly rob, assassinate cadres, and create disturbances and riots occurred in many places. All political bandits who had not been subjected to rigorous suppression and extermination became more active. Some former reactionary party and special agent members who had long expressed repentance and were willing to submit to control also refused or evaded control in various forms, or even colluded with reactionary organizations again to carry out sabotage activities. At this time, not only were reactionary Taoist sects and gangs spreading rumors and sabotage in various ways, carrying out activities against the People's Government, and not only in the newly liberated areas were some landlords threatening farmers with "decapitation when Chiang Kai-shek comes" to sabotage land reform and prepare to welcome Chiang Kai-shek, but even in the semi-old areas where land reform had already been implemented, some landlords whose "prestige" had not been completely eliminated rose up to carry out retaliation against the farmers, threatening the farmers to return land, grain, livestock, and farm tools, and driving the farmers to move. In some places, counter-revolutionary underground armies were organized to prepare for riots. In some places, the entire families of village cadres were killed. There were instances of more than ten agricultural association cadres being killed at once; there were instances of more than forty agricultural association members being killed in one village; there were instances of entire teams of civilians transporting military supplies for the People's Liberation Army being killed. In Guangxi Province alone, more than 3,000 cadres of the People's Government were killed. And the bandits there had been increasing over the past period because we did not kill or rarely killed the bandit leaders and habitual bandits. As for the production, construction, and various material assets destroyed by counter-revolutionary elements, it is even more difficult to calculate. The arrogance of the special agents and bandits had truly reached an intolerable level.

　　From this, it can be proven that the running dogs of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and their accomplices will never be reconciled to death simply because their rule has been overthrown, but are constantly using every possible means to ferociously attack the people and the People's Government.

　　This proves that boundless leniency is wrong. All incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders and other elements who continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities after liberation must not be treated with leniency, but must be severely suppressed. Those who deserve to be killed should be killed, those who deserve to be imprisoned should be imprisoned, and those who deserve to be controlled should be controlled. There must be no vacillation or condoning of evil. This is clearly stipulated in the Common Program, and it is also what Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us.

　　Since Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government have such a firm and clear policy, why did the tendency of boundless leniency occur? This is because there are many confused ideas among the cadres.

　　First of all, there was arrogance and complacency after the victory, numbness and indifference, thinking that so many troops of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang had been eliminated, the Kuomintang reactionary rule had been overthrown, and what was so great about the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, thus losing vigilance and relaxing suppression.

　　Secondly, some comrades confused the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front with the resolute elimination of counter-revolutionary remnants in the struggle against the enemy. They did not understand that the more thoroughly the counter-revolutionary remnants are eliminated, the fewer the factors that provoke discord and undermine the united front, and therefore the united front becomes more consolidated. At the same time, the more consolidated and widespread the united front, the more isolated the enemy becomes, and the easier it is to eliminate the counter-revolutionary remnants.

　　Some people are afraid that resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries will "cause shock and panic." They have not distinguished who is shocked and who is panicked. Are special agents and bandits shocked and panicked? The purpose of suppression is precisely to eliminate them, they should be shocked, they should be panicked. Isn't that good? What's so scary about that? Are the people shocked and panicked? As long as the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries does not cause indiscriminate beatings and killings, but is both "stable" and "accurate," the people will only applaud and cheer, and will never panic! What they are panicked about is the government's boundless leniency, vacillation, condoning of evil, indulgence of special agents and bandits harming the people, and not standing up for the people.

　　Some people believe that the people have already won and should be benevolent and lenient. Those who say this do not understand that without resolutely eliminating the people's enemies, there would be no victory for the people; without resolutely suppressing the remaining American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, there would be no security for the people and no consolidation of the people's victory. Being benevolent and lenient towards them is being cruel to the people, is treating the great people's revolutionary cause as a child's play, and is being disloyal to the people. The severity of the sentence for criminals should be based on the magnitude of their crimes. If their crimes deserve death, they should be resolutely executed; if their crimes do not deserve death, they should not be killed. For those whose crimes are between deserving death and not deserving death, do not kill them either, only kill those who deserve to be killed and must be killed, important counter-revolutionary elements with solid evidence.

　　Although the occurrence of the tendency of boundless leniency is due to the above-mentioned various confused ideas, as Chairman Mao said, the decisive key lies in leadership.

　　Since the Central People's Government successively issued instructions and tightened leadership last autumn, various localities have quickly corrected the tendency of boundless leniency according to the general policy of combining suppression with leniency, and began to resolutely suppress the most heinous and incorrigible bandit leaders, habitual bandits, despots, special agents, and heads of reactionary secret societies. As a result, the situation quickly changed. The landlords and despots who originally retaliated against the farmers bowed their heads and confessed their crimes to the farmers; the special agents who were originally carrying out sabotage everywhere and acting wildly were either executed or imprisoned; the many originally large groups of political bandits were quickly eliminated, or collapsed and surrendered; even in Fujian, Western Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and other places where the bandit forces were originally the most rampant, the revolutionary order has gradually become consolidated. In short, evil forces have declined, and righteous forces have risen. When various localities resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary activities and executed important bandit leaders, habitual bandits, despots, special agents, and heads of reactionary secret societies, what the masses showed was not panic and shock, but thunderous applause, cheering long live, or setting off firecrackers to celebrate. Wherever the correct policy of the Central People's Government has been implemented, the masses no longer criticize us for "having no law of heaven," but praise "the People's Government has law and heaven," "stands up for the people," praise "the policy of the People's Government is correct, the method is good," "truly looks like a people's government." However, there are still some places where the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities is not resolute enough, showing vacillation and incompetence, continuing to indulge special agents and bandits in evading the law, thus incurring the dissatisfaction of the masses. We believe that these places must quickly thoroughly correct this bias according to the policy of the Central People's Government, and resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities.

　　Now, in order to provide cadres and the masses with legal weapons to suppress counter-revolutionary activities, in order to provide personnel who try counter-revolutionary criminals with sentencing standards, in order to overcome or prevent rightist deviations and leftist deviations in the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, there is a need for a regulation on punishing counter-revolutionaries. Various localities have also universally requested the Central People's Government to quickly promulgate such a regulation. Therefore, the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, based on the principle of Article 7 of the Common Program, drafted the "Draft Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," which has been approved by the 71st Plenary Meeting of the Government Administration Council and is now submitted to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval.

　　This regulation is formulated based on the policy of combining suppression with leniency, that is, "the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced are not questioned, and those who render meritorious service are rewarded." For the main leaders of various counter-revolutionary activities, for the special agents and spies who are incorrigible and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, the principle of severe punishment is adopted; for the coerced elements who are coerced and deceived by counter-revolutionary elements to participate in counter-revolutionary activities, for the elements who participated in counter-revolutionary activities before liberation but whose crimes were not serious, and who have indeed repented after liberation, especially those who have rendered meritorious service to the people, the principle of lenient treatment is adopted.

　　In order to make it easier for cadres to grasp this regulation, we have tried to solve problems and avoid being cumbersome and trivial when drafting it, so it is written relatively concisely and generally.

　　Whether it is appropriate or not, please verify and approve.

　　政务院政治法律委员会彭真副主任
    向中央人民政府委员会关于镇压反革命和惩治反革命条例问题的报告
    主席、副主席、各位委员：
    镇压反革命活动问题，是现在全国人民极关心的一个问题。在过去一个时期内，因为我们还没有切实贯彻共同纲领第七条镇压与宽大相结合的方针，很多地方发生了过分宽大的偏向，曾经引起各阶层人民对人民政府的不满。
    人民责备我们“宽大无边”，“有天无法”，说：“天不怕地不怕，就怕共产党讲宽大”，说：“人民政府什么都好，就是对坏人这样客气，看着坏人残害老百姓，不给老百姓作主，不好”。有的工人义愤填胸地质问干部说：“看！我们竞赛几个月，特务一把火完蛋了；再不镇压，说什么我们也不竞赛了”。有的说：“政府睡着了”，“连敌我都不分”。有的人说政府“姑息养奸，遗害人民”，“简直不像个人民政府的样子”。
    人民群众是公道的，聪明的。人民称赞抗美援朝做得好，土地改革做得好，物价金融稳定得好，城市管理和民主设施都很好，只是认为对于反革命分子过于宽大。的确，在这个问题上，我们过去还没有做得很好，并且有一个时期，有些地方做得很不好。特别是美国帝国主义者发动侵朝战争之后，问题表现得更清楚了。
    那时，美蒋特务匪徒们及其他残余的反革命势力，以为他们梦想的“三次大战，反攻大陆”的时机到了，美蒋就要回来复辟了。他们狂妄地撕破了平日“伪装悔改”的假面具，从地下的隐蔽活动，伸出头来，进行各种露骨的破坏活动，明目张胆地向人民进攻。特务匪徒阴谋破坏铁路桥梁，破坏工厂矿山，烧毁仓库资财，公开抢劫，刺杀干部，骚扰暴乱的事件，在很多地方发生了。凡是没有遭受严厉清剿、镇压的政治土匪，都愈加活跃了。有些早已表示悔改、愿意服从管制的反动党特分子，也以各种形式拒绝或逃避管制，甚至又与反动组织勾通，进行破坏活动了。这时，不但反动道门帮会以各种方式造谣破坏，进行反对人民政府的活动，不但在新解放的地区，有些地主以“蒋介石来了要杀头”来威胁农民，破坏土地改革，筹备欢迎蒋介石，甚至在已经实行土地改革的半老区，有些“威风”没有完全被打掉的地主，也起来向农民实行倒算，威胁农民退还土地、粮食、牲口、农具，赶农民搬家。有些地方，组织了反革命的地下军，准备进行暴动。有些地方，村干部全家被杀。农会干部一次被杀十余人者有之；一村的农会会员被杀四十余人者有之；为人民解放军运输军需粮草的民夫，整队被杀者有之。仅广西一省，人民政府的干部被杀害者，即有三千余人。而那里的土匪在过去一个时期内曾经越剿越多，因为我们不杀或很少杀掉匪首和惯匪。至于生产、建设和各种物质资财被反革命分子破坏的，更是难以数字计算。特务匪徒的猖狂，真是达到难以容忍的程度了。
    从这里可以证明，帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派及其帮凶们，决不因为他们的统治已被打倒，即甘心死亡，而是无时无刻不在利用一切可能，穷凶极恶地向人民和人民政府进攻。
    这证明，宽大无边是错误的。一切怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子和其他在解放后继续进行反革命活动的分子，决不能宽大，必须予以严厉的镇压。该杀者杀，该关者关，该管制者予以管制，决不能优柔寡断，姑息养奸。这是共同纲领所明白规定的，也是毛主席所屡屡指示过我们的。
    毛主席和中央人民政府既有这样坚定明确的方针，为什么又会发生宽大无边的偏向呢？这是因为在干部中存在着许多混乱的思想。
    首先，是在胜利后骄傲轻敌，麻木不仁，以为那样多的蒋介石匪帮的军队已被消灭，国民党反动统治已被打倒，残余的反革命分子还有什么了不起，因而就丧失了警惕，放松了镇压。
    其次，是有些同志，把人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大，和对敌斗争中坚决肃清反革命残余的问题相混淆了。他们不了解，反革命残余肃清得越彻底，挑拨离间、破坏统一战线的因素就越少，因而统一战线就越加巩固。同时，统一战线越巩固，越广泛，敌人就越加孤立，反革命残余就越容易被肃清。
    又有的人，惧怕坚决镇压反革命，会“引起震动和恐慌”。他们没有分清什么人震动，什么人恐慌。特务匪徒震动恐慌吗？镇压的目的，正是要消灭他们，他们应该震动，应该恐慌。这难道不好吗？这有什么可怕？人民震动恐慌吗？人民政府镇压反革命，只要不引起乱打乱杀，既“稳”又“准”，人民只有拍手称快，决不会恐慌！他们恐慌的倒是政府宽大无边，优柔寡断，姑息养奸，纵容特务匪徒残害人民，而不替人民作主。
    有人认为，人民已经胜利了，应该仁慈宽大。说这样话的人不了解：不坚决消灭人民的敌人，就没有人民的胜利；不坚决地将残余的美蒋匪帮这一群豺狼镇压下去，就没有人民的安全和人民胜利的巩固，对于他们的仁慈、宽大，就是对于人民的残酷，就是把伟大的人民革命事业当儿戏，就是对于人民不忠诚。对于罪犯判刑的轻重，应根据其罪恶的大小。如果其罪该杀，即应坚决处刑；如果罪不该杀，即应不杀。对于介乎可杀可不杀之间者，也不要杀，只杀那些该杀和必须杀的人，有确实证据的重要反革命分子。
    宽大无边偏向的发生，虽然是由于上述各种混乱思想，但是正如毛主席所说，决定的关键，还是在于领导。
    自从去年秋季，中央人民政府连续颁发指示和抓紧领导以后，各地很快即根据镇压与宽大相结合的总方针，纠正宽大无边的偏向，对于罪大恶极怙恶不悛的匪首、惯匪、恶霸、特务和反动会门头子开始进行坚决的镇压。于是情况迅速改变了。原来向农民倒算的地主、恶霸，纷纷向农民低头认罪了；原来到处进行破坏，猖狂活动的特务，或被枪决，或被监禁了；原来许多成股的政治土匪，迅速被消灭，或土崩瓦解、缴械投降了；连原来匪势最猖狂的福建、湘西、广西、广东、四川、贵州、云南等地，革命秩序也渐趋巩固了。总之，邪气下降，正气上升了。当着各地坚决镇压反革命活动，枪毙重要匪首、惯匪、恶霸、特务及反动会门头子的时候，群众所表现的不是恐慌和震动，而是掌声如雷，欢呼万岁，或者放鞭炮来庆祝。凡是贯彻了中央人民政府正确方针的地方，群众再不责备我们“有天无法”，而是称赞“人民政府有天有法”，“为民作主”，称赞“人民政府方针对，办法好”，“真像个人民政府的样子”了。但目前仍有些地方对反革命活动的镇压不够坚决，表示优柔寡断，软弱无能，继续纵容特务匪徒逍遥法外，因而招致人民群众的不满。我们认为这些地方必须迅速根据中央人民政府的方针，彻底纠正这种偏向，坚决镇压一切反革命活动。
    现在，为了给予干部和群众以镇压反革命活动的法律武器，为了给予审判反革命罪犯的人员以量刑的标准，为了在坚决镇压反革命活动中克服或防止右的偏向和左的偏向，需要有一个惩治反革命的条例。各地也普遍要求中央人民政府迅速颁布这样的条例。因此，政务院政法委员会根据共同纲领第七条的原则，草拟了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例草案”，业经政务院第七十一次政务会议通过，现在提请中央人民政府委员会审查批准。
    这个条例是根据镇压与宽大相结合，即“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策而制定的。对于各种反革命的首要分子，对于解放后怙恶不悛、继续进行反革命活动的特务间谍分子，是采取从重处理的原则；对于被反革命分子胁迫、欺骗、而参加反革命活动的胁从分子，对于解放前虽曾参加反革命活动，但罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改的分子，特别是已为人民立功的分子，则采取了从宽处理的原则。
    为了使干部容易掌握这个条例，我们在起草的时候，力求能解决问题，又力避庞杂、烦琐，因此写得比较简要概括。
    是否有当，请予核定。
