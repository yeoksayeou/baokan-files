　　Regarding the United Nations Resolution
    The World Peace Council notes that the United Nations has failed to respond to the "Letter to the United Nations" from the Second World Peace Congress, as if the proposals for maintaining peace advocated by the representatives of hundreds of millions of people were irrelevant to it.
    Since the World Peace Congress adopted the "Letter to the United Nations," the United Nations has further disappointed the people's expectations, and the adoption of the resolution condemning China as an "aggressor" has brought the people's disappointment to a climax.
    The United Nations, with its authority, has approved and covered up the systematic killing of nearly one million people in Korea by the American army, including the elderly, women, and children, and has destroyed and burned Korean cities and villages, turning them into rubble.
    The World Peace Council has resolved to send a delegation to the United Nations. The delegation members are: Nenni (Italy), Blum (Belgium), Mrs. Davis (UK), Mrs. Street (Australia), Weil-Curiel (France), Tikhonov (USSR), Wu Yaozong (China), Hruska (Czechoslovakia), D'Arboussier (Africa), Neruda (Chile), General Yala (Mexico), Robeson (USA), Reverend Uphaus (USA), Dr. Atal (India).
    The delegation will be responsible for demanding the United Nations to: (1) Consider the recommendations in the "Letter to the United Nations" from the World Peace Congress and the resolutions passed at this session of the World Peace Council, and express opinions on each item. (2) Restore the task stipulated by the United Nations Charter, that is, the United Nations should serve as a place for governments to reach agreements, rather than as a tool of any dominant group.
    This decision of the World Peace Council will be supported by hundreds of millions of people, who have the right to constantly and vigilantly watch to ensure that high-level international institutions do not betray their mission of safeguarding peace.

　　关于联合国的决议
    世界和平理事会注意到：联合国未能答复第二届世界和平大会的《致联合国书》，仿佛数亿人民的代表所主张的维持和平的建议与它漠不相关一样。
    自从世界和平大会通过《致联合国书》以来，联合国已更进一步地辜负了人民对它的期望，并且由于通过谴责中国为“侵略者”的决议而使人民的失望达于顶点。
    联合国以它的权威批准和掩护美国军队在朝鲜有系统地杀害近一百万人，其中包括老人、妇女和儿童，并且摧毁和焚烧了朝鲜的城市和乡村，使之化为瓦砾。
    世界和平理事会决议派遣代表团到联合国，代表团人员为：南尼（意）、布伦姆（比）、戴维斯夫人（英）、斯崔特夫人（澳大利亚）、魏基利（法）、吉洪诺夫（苏）、吴耀宗（中）、赫鲁玛德卡（捷克）、达波赛（非洲）、尼鲁达（智利）、雅拉将军（墨西哥）、罗伯逊（美）、乌法斯牧师（美）、阿塔尔博士（印度）。
    该代表团将负责向联合国要求：（一）考虑世界和平大会致联合国书中的各项建议以及世界和平理事会本届会议上通过的各项决议，并逐项表示意见。（二）恢复执行联合国宪章所规定的任务，就是说联合国应当作为各国政府之间取得协议的场所，而不应作为任何居统治地位的集团的工具。
    世界和平理事会这一决定将获得千百万人民的支持，他们有权经常警惕地注视，以保证高级的国际机构不致背叛其所负担的保障和平的使命。
