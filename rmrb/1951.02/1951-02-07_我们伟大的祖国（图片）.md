    Our Great Motherland
    This is the parade of railway workers in Beijing after liberation. On this day twenty-eight years ago, the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway were brutally slaughtered by the reactionary rulers of the time for fighting for the democratic rights of the working class; now, the railway workers and other workers across the country, like all other workers, have become the masters of the country. Long live the martyrs who sacrificed in the "February 7th" massacre! Long live the Chinese working class!
