Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: Soviet experts invited to our country have made significant contributions to the industrial construction of Northeast China over the past year. Thanks to the timely assistance of Soviet experts in improving many major production technology issues in various factories, many products have greatly exceeded previous peak production levels. In a certain steel plant, the roof life of a certain open-hearth furnace could only last for a maximum of 57 heats and a minimum of 27 heats in the first half of last year. Coupled with other technical difficulties at the time, the monthly production targets could not be met. After careful research by Soviet experts, many improvement measures were proposed, which increased the roof life to over 100 heats, increased the furnace volume, and shortened the tapping time. The furnace's output in November last year increased by 35% compared to January, surpassing the highest standard during the puppet Manchukuo period. A certain coking plant, also due to the technical guidance of Soviet experts, reduced the coking time from 21 hours per coke output in 1949 to a new record of 16.5 hours per coke output (it was 18 to 20 hours during the puppet Manchukuo period). The coking rate also increased from 66% at the beginning of last year to 68%. In the coal mining industry, the recovery rate of thick coal seams has increased by 20% to 30% due to the suggestions of Soviet experts and the implementation of the new Soviet coal mining method. Some coal mines have also greatly improved labor efficiency and gradually reduced accidents due to mechanized operations and improved ventilation equipment in the pits. In the machinery industry, Soviet experts have made many suggestions for improving the manufacturing methods of important parts such as gears and headstocks, making them durable. In the second half of last year, Soviet machine tool experts demonstrated the "high-speed cutting method," which greatly inspired Chinese workers in improving operating methods. Yang Youde, a lathe operator at State-owned Machine Factory No. 4, created a new record for machining cold steel wheels after learning the "high-speed cutting method." He used to machine one in 90 minutes, but now he can machine one in 4 minutes and 20 seconds, increasing efficiency by 19 times; the quality has also improved from second-class products to first-class products. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the tool section of a certain factory produced taps with 100% quality. The maximum service life of each tap increased from threading 300 holes in the past to 13,000 holes, an increase of more than 42 times, creating an unprecedented record in the factory's tool manufacturing.
    The operation and management of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China have also been greatly improved with the help of Soviet experts. Over the past year, experts have provided many valuable opinions and achieved good results in formulating production plans, determining production responsibility systems, and simplifying statistical reports. For example, after a certain company accepted the Soviet experts' suggestions on establishing a production dispatching room and implementing the work rules for various departments drafted by the Soviet experts, the division of labor and responsibilities became clearer than before. Currently, the company's staff has been reduced by 7,000 compared to the past, but both output and quality have improved. After Soviet experts helped various machine factories implement assembly line operations, the complex manufacturing work could be carried out in an orderly manner. The experts helped the Paper Making Factory of the Light Industry Bureau and other factories implement production charts, which quickly strengthened workshop technical management. For example, the actual production efficiency of the wooden boiler (a large pot for steaming and cooking paper-making raw materials), one of the main equipment of the Shixian Paper Mill, exceeded 44% of its original design capacity due to strengthened technical management; the mechanical operation rate also reached 97%, which many people thought was impossible to achieve, and therefore overfulfilled the production plan every month last year. A certain refractory material factory accepted the Soviet experts' suggestions on improving statistical reports, which enabled the factory director to clearly understand the previous day's production situation and product delivery numbers in just 15 minutes every morning; it was also very easy to find problems in actual work from the reports, and to deal with them and improve the chaotic and passive situation in the past in a timely manner.
    Soviet experts are not only highly skilled but also have profound scientific theories and a proactive and responsible work style. Therefore, many engineers, technicians, and workers sincerely stated that getting along with Soviet experts can bring them unlimited benefits. In the past, some factories and mines had specifically scheduled time to invite Soviet experts to give lessons and report on their experiences, which had excellent results. Recently, in order to enable factories and mines to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has required its subordinate enterprises to adopt more systematic, step-by-step, and planned methods to organize workers to learn from Soviet experts in order to effectively improve the technical and theoretical level of our country's workers.

　　苏联应邀来我国的专家热情帮助东北工业建设
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】我国聘请的苏联专家，一年来对东北工业建设的贡献极大。由于苏联专家们及时帮助各厂改进了许多重大的生产技术问题，许多产品都大大超过以往的最高生产水平。某炼钢厂的某号平炉，去年上半年炉顶寿命最多能用五十七次，少的只用二十七次，又因当时其他方面的技术困难，以致每月的生产任务均不能完成。后经苏联专家的周密研究，提出了许多改进办法，使炉顶的寿命提高到百次以上，并增加了炉的容积，缩短了出钢时间。该炉去年十一月份的产量比一月份提高了百分之三十五，超过了伪满时的最高标准。某炼焦厂亦由于苏联专家的技术指导，使炼焦时间由一九四九年的二十一小时出一次焦，达到现在十六小时半出一次焦的新纪录（伪满时期是十八至二十小时出一次焦），出焦率也由去年初的百分之六十六提高到百分之六十八。在煤矿工业方面，各矿根据苏联专家的建议和实行苏联新式采煤法的结果，厚煤层的回采率提高了百分之二十到三十。部分煤矿并由于作业机械化，改善了坑内通风设备，使劳动效率大大提高，事故逐渐减少。在机械工业方面，苏联专家曾对齿轮、床头等重要零件的制造方法，提出许多改进的建议，使其能经久耐用；去年下半年，苏联工作母机专家表演了“高速切削法”，使中国职工在改进操作方法上得到很大启示。国营机器四厂车工杨有德，学习了“高速切削法”后，即创造出车冷钢轮的新纪录。他过去九十分钟车一个，现在降至四分二十秒车一个，提高效率十九倍；质量亦由二级品提高到一级品。某厂工具科在苏联专家的指导下，做出的丝锥质量达到了百分之百，每个丝锥的最高使用寿命，由过去绞三百个活提高到一万三千个，增加了四十二倍还多，创造了该厂工具制造上的空前纪录。
    东北工矿企业的经营管理工作也因得到苏联专家的帮助而大大提高一步。一年来，不论在制定生产计划、确定生产责任制度、简化统计表报等方面，专家们都提供了许多宝贵意见，并收到良好效果。如某公司接受了苏联专家关于建立生产调度室，并实行了苏联专家所拟定的各部门工作细则后，分工与责任便比以前更为明确。现该公司的工作人员已较过去节省了七千名，但产量和质量反都比前提高。苏联专家在帮助各机器厂实行流水作业法后，使工序复杂的制造工作，得以有条不紊地进行。专家们帮助轻工业管理局造纸等厂实行了生产图表制，使车间技术管理迅速加强。如石岘造纸厂主要设备之一的木釜（蒸煮造纸原料的大锅），即因技术管理加强，使实际生产效率超过原来设计能力的百分之四十四；机械运转率亦发挥到许多人曾认为达不到的百分之九十七的水平，因而去年一年中月月超额完成生产计划。某耐火材料厂接受了苏联专家关于改进统计表报的建议，使厂长每晨只需化一刻钟的时间，即可明晰地了解到前一天的生产状况和产品缴库的数字；并极易从表报上发现实际工作中的问题，及时地加以处理，改进了过去的忙乱和被动的情况。
    苏联专家不但技术高明，而且有高深的科学理论，和积极负责的工作作风，因此许多的工程师、技术人员和工人都恳切地表示：和苏联专家相处能使自己获得无限的教益。过去若干厂矿曾经特地规定了时间，专门邀请苏联专家来上课和报告经验，结果收效极好。最近，东北人民政府工业部为了使各厂矿更进一步学习苏联的先进经验，要求所属企业采取更有系统、有步骤、有计划的方法，组织职工向苏联专家学习，以便有效地提高我国职工的技术与理论水平。
