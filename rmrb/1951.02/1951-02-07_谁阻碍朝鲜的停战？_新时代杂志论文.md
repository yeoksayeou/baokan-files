　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 4th: The fifth issue of *New Era* magazine carries an article entitled "Who is Obstructing the Korean Armistice?" The author, Sergeyeva, lists convincing facts exposing the American imperialists' plans to expand the Korean War. Sergeyeva writes: American politicians try to pose as peace-loving people, clamoring that their efforts are aimed at achieving peace. But in fact, they do not want an armistice in Korea because all their plans, all their calculations, and all their practical measures are aimed at expanding aggression in the Far East. This is precisely the plan that Truman expounded in his State of the Union address to Congress. The plan to re-militarize Japan has the same purpose. The U.S. State Department's proposal to thirty United Nations member states to declare the People's Republic of China an aggressor and to impose economic sanctions and a blockade on it also demonstrates this purpose.

　　Sergeyeva further said: The American people do not support this policy. The broadest sections of the American population firmly demand an end to the shameful Korean War. The American plan to expand aggression in the Far East not only encounters growing mass opposition but also increasingly forces America's North Atlantic bloc partners to stop and consider the consequences of this adventurous policy.

　　谁阻碍朝鲜的停战？
    新时代杂志论文
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志第五期刊载题为《谁阻碍朝鲜的停战？》的论文。作者赛吉耶娃列举令人信服的事实，揭露了美帝国主义的旨在扩大朝鲜战争的计划。赛吉耶娃写道：美国的政客们企图装出和平爱好者的姿态，嚷叫着说：他们的努力以获致和平为目的。但是，事实上，他们不希望朝鲜停战，因为他们的一切计划、一切盘算、一切实际措施都是以扩大在远东的侵略为目的的。这正是杜鲁门在他致国会的《国情》咨文中所阐释的计划。使日本重新军国主义化的计划，其目的也是一样的。美国国务院向三十个联合国会员国提出的要求宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者并对它施行经济制裁及封锁的建议中，也表现出了这个目的。
    赛吉耶娃进一步说：美国人民不支持这个政策。最广大阶层的美国居民坚决要求停止可耻的朝鲜战争。美国扩大侵略远东的计划不仅遭遇到日渐增涨的群众反对，而且越来越迫使美国的北大西洋集团的伙计们停下来考虑这种冒险方针的后果了。
