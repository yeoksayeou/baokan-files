The meeting decided to suggest to Returned Overseas Chinese across the country that they hold protest demonstrations in major cities nationwide on February 21st (Anti-Colonial System Struggle Day) to protest the United States' arming of Japan. The expanded council meeting also issued a proposal stating:

	We Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have personally experienced the pain of the Japanese imperialist rule and destruction, and we have a deeper understanding of the serious threat posed by the collusion between US and Japanese imperialism to our people's motherland. In order to more actively express our opposition to this US imperialist measure of invading our country, to defend world peace, and to further deepen patriotic and internationalist ideological education, the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association calls on Returned Overseas Chinese in various places to simultaneously hold nationwide Returned Overseas Chinese protest demonstrations against US imperialism's arming of Japan on February 21st.

	The proposal calls on Returned Overseas Chinese in various places to greet this great movement with active actions, and puts forward the following suggestions:

	1. In cities with a relatively high concentration of Returned Overseas Chinese, such as Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Jiangmen, Haikou, Wenchang, Meixian, Nanning, Kunming, etc., the Returned Overseas Chinese Association shall be responsible for preparations, in coordination with local democratic parties and people's organizations, and in consultation with relevant authorities, to hold a demonstration rally on February 21st.
	2. During the parade, adopt various forms of publicity to express the anger and protest of Overseas Chinese against US imperialism's invasion of our country and arming of Japan, to express the love of Overseas Chinese for the people's motherland, and the various persecutions suffered by Overseas Chinese overseas.
	3. Through newspapers, magazines, Overseas Chinese township tabloids and broadcasting and other propaganda institutions, combine the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and oppose the arming of Japan to carry out propaganda work.
	4. Based on the specific circumstances of various places, mobilize Returned Overseas Chinese to formulate patriotic covenants,慰劳 the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and慰问 Overseas Chinese overseas.
	5. After receiving the news, Overseas Chinese organizations in various places should actively prepare with a high degree of patriotism. The preparation situation in various places is expected to be notified to the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association before February 18th.

[Reported by this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: 1,425 Overseas Chinese who returned from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other places in mid-January held a meeting on the ship to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country with a high degree of love for the motherland, and jointly donated more than 17.98 million yuan to慰劳 the Chinese People's Volunteers. Rubber plantation worker Li Housheng said when he donated his gold ring: "We have suffered all kinds of persecution from the local reactionary government in Thailand, and now we know that this was directed by US imperialism. Our Overseas Chinese workers must take practical actions to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea and overthrow US imperialism." Overseas Chinese youths Zheng Jianmin and Zeng Qingping decided to return to their motherland to participate in national defense construction after hearing about the enthusiastic participation of the youth of the motherland in various military cadre schools, and they both contributed the cash they brought back. Old Mrs. Chen He, who is nearly 70 years old, donated 100,000 yuan, and she said emotionally: "This is what I have saved through frugality, and I am willing to donate it to buy bullets to fight American devils."

    【新华社十日讯】北京归国华侨联谊会于九日下午召开扩大理事会议。会议决定向全国归国华侨建议于二月二十一日（反殖民制度斗争日）在全国各大城市举行归国华侨抗议美国武装日本示威游行大会。扩大理事会议并发出建议书称：
    我们华侨在东南亚各地，身历日本帝国主义统治摧残的痛苦，更深刻地体验到美日帝国主义勾结对我人民祖国的严重威胁。为了更积极表示反对美帝国主义这一侵略我国的措施、保卫世界和平并进一步深入爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，北京归国华侨联谊会号召各地归国华侨于二月二十一日同时举行全国范围的归国华侨抗议美帝国主义武装日本的示威游行大会。
    建议书号召各地归国侨胞以积极的行动，来迎接这一伟大的运动。并提出以下几项建议：
    一、在归国华侨比较集中的城市，如广州、福州、厦门、汕头、江门、海口、文昌、梅县、南宁、昆明等，由归国华侨联谊会负责筹备，配合当地各民主党派人民团体，并商请各有关机关协助，于二月二十一日举行示威游行大会。
    二、在游行时采取各种宣传方式，表达华侨对美帝国主义侵略我国与武装日本的愤怒与抗议，表达华侨对人民祖国的热爱，以及华侨在海外所遭受的种种迫害。
    三、通过报纸、杂志、侨乡小报和广播等宣传机构，结合抗美援朝、反对武装日本运动，进行宣传工作。
    四、依据各地具体情况，发动归国华侨订立爱国公约，慰劳中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军，并慰问在海外的华侨。
    五、各地华侨团体在接到消息后，应以高度的爱国主义精神积极筹备。各地筹备情况，希于二月十八日前通知北京归国华侨联谊会。
    【本报讯】新华社广州讯：一月中旬由泰国、印尼和马来亚等地乘轮归国的华侨一千四百二十五人，在船上以高度的爱祖国热情，举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大会，并共同捐献了一千七百九十八万多元，慰劳中国人民志愿军。橡胶园工人李后生在捐献他的金戒指时说：“我们在泰国受尽当地反动政府的迫害，现在知道了这是美帝国主义指使的。我们华侨工人要以实际行动支援在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军，打倒美帝国主义。”华侨青年郑剑民和曾青萍是因为听到祖国青年参加各种军事干部学校的热烈情况而决心返回祖国参加国防建设的，他们都献出了带回的现款。年近七十的老太太陈何氏捐出了十万元，她并感动地说：“这是我省吃俭用节余下来的，我愿意捐献出来买子弹打美国鬼子。”
