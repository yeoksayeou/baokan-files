　　The Joy of the People of Lala Kou Village, Qinghai
    Lala Kou Village is a small village in Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province. During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the peasants of this village lived like beasts of burden. They had never seen a doctor and could not afford medicine at all. Death threatened them at any moment.
    The whole country has been liberated. Although Lala Kou Village is an extremely remote mountain village, Chairman Mao and the People's Government are also concerned about it. On January 8th this year, some of the staff of the Seventh Central Anti-Epidemic Brigade came here. This was an unprecedented event in the history of Lala Kou Village. The news spread throughout the entire village immediately. After the comrades of the anti-epidemic team settled down, all the sick people in the village came, and even those who were not sick came to ask questions. The Mongolian man Gong Shu Nan said to the comrades of the anti-epidemic team: "Chairman Mao has the people of our small village in his heart. We have indescribable gratitude in our hearts." A person suffering from chest disease, after effective treatment, said: "When I think of Chairman Mao's concern for us, I don't feel the pain when changing medicine or having surgery."

　　青海拉拉口村人民的喜悦
    拉拉口村是青海省湟源县的一个小村庄。蒋马匪帮统治时期，这村子的农民过着牛马一般的生活，他们没有看见过医生，也根本买不起药，死亡随时都在威胁着他们。
    全国解放了，拉拉口村虽然是一个极其偏僻的小山村，但是毛主席、人民政府也关怀到它了。今年一月八日，中央防疫第七大队的一部分工作人员来到了这里，这是拉拉口村在历史上从未有过的大事，这个消息马上传遍了整个村子。防疫队的同志住下以后，全村有病的人都来了，没有病的也有来问长问短的。蒙民贡树南向防疫队的同志说：“毛主席把我们这小村的人民也放在心上，我们心里真有说不出的感激。”一个患胸病的人，经过有效的治疗，他说：“我一想到毛主席对我们的关心，换药动手术时也不觉痛了。”
