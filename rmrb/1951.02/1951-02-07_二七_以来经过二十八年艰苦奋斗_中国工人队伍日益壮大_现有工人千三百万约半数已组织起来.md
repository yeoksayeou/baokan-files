Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: On the twenty-eighth anniversary of the "February 7th" strike, the ranks of the Chinese working class have grown unprecedentedly, and trade union organizations have also greatly developed. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there are currently 13 million workers in the country (including staff), of which more than 3 million are industrial workers. The number of trade union members nationwide has reached over 5.13 million. At present, in addition to the provincial and municipal trade unions in North China directly under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, three general trade unions have been established in large administrative regions, two offices of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in large administrative regions, forty-seven provincial and municipal general trade unions belonging to large administrative regions (of which eleven are preparatory committees), one hundred and seventy-six municipal general trade unions belonging to provinces (of which thirty are preparatory committees), one thousand six hundred and eighty-four county (town) general trade unions, and one hundred and seventy-three special district trade union offices. In terms of industrial systems, the national committees of seven industrial trade unions, the national preparatory committees of six industrial trade unions, and the national working committees of three industrial trade unions have now been established. Under the unified leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the above-mentioned regional and industrial trade union organizations have become powerful institutions for uniting, organizing, and educating the Chinese working class.
　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese trade union organization has led the broad masses of workers in protracted and unyielding struggles against imperialism and feudalism and has grown stronger with the victorious development of the revolutionary situation. According to the "China Labor Yearbook," in 1930, the total number of workers in twenty-nine cities in nine provinces with relatively developed industries across the country was only more than 1.2 million. The total number of railway workers nationwide was only more than 99,000, but now there are more than 454,000. At present, 2,374 grassroots trade unions have been established on the national railways. By the time of Japan's surrender around 1945, the number of trade union members nationwide was 800,000, but when the People's Liberation Army launched a major counteroffensive in August 1948, it increased to 2.83 million. Since the People's Liberation War achieved a basic victory on a national scale, the number of trade union members nationwide has increased to more than 5 million.

　　“二七”以来经过二十八年艰苦奋斗
    中国工人队伍日益壮大   
    现有工人千三百万约半数已组织起来
    【新华社五日讯】在“二七”大罢工二十八年的现在，中国工人阶级的队伍已空前地壮大起来，工会组织更有了很大发展。据全国总工会的统计，全国现有工人一千三百万（包括职员），其中产业工人占三百余万；全国工会会员已达到五百一十三万以上。目前除华北地区各省市总工会直属全国总工会领导外，全国其他地区已建立了三个大行政区的总工会、两个全国总工会在大行政区的办事处、四十七个大行政区属省市总工会（其中十一个是筹备委员会）、一百七十六个省属市总工会（其中三十个是筹备委员会）、一千六百八十四个县（镇）总工会和一百七十三个专区工会办事处。就产业系统说，现已成立了七个产业工会的全国委员会、六个产业工会的全国筹备委员会和三个产业工会的全国工作委员会。上述地区的和产业的工会组织，在中华全国总工会统一领导下，已成为团结、组织、教育中国工人阶级的强有力的机构。
    中国工会组织在中国共产党领导下，曾领导广大工人群众进行了不屈不挠的长期的反帝反封建斗争，并随着革命形势的胜利发展而壮大。据《中国劳动年鉴》载，一九三○年，在全国工业比较发展的九省二十九个城市中，工人总数仅一百二十万余人。全国铁路工人仅有九万九千余人，而现在却有四十五万四千余人。目前全国铁路已建立了二千三百七十四个基层工会。到一九四五年日本投降前后，全国工会会员是八十万，而一九四八年八月人民解放军大举反攻时，即增达二百八十三万。自人民解放战争在全国范围取得基本胜利迄今，全国工会会员便增至五百余万。
