The Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Ministry published in Pyongyang in 1950 a book in English entitled "Documents and Materials Exposing the Provocateurs of the Korean Civil War." The materials collected in this book are the most powerful evidence of the US imperialists directing the South Korean Syngman Rhee traitorous clique and directly participating in provoking the Korean War.

The book contains twenty-nine documents and materials exposing the war crimes of the US-Syngman Rhee gang. Except for the fifteenth item, which is the confession broadcast of Kim Hyo-seok, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the South Korean puppet government, and the sixteenth item, which is the confession broadcast of Moon Hak-bong, the former advisor to Syngman Rhee, the remaining twenty or so items were seized by the Korean People's Army when it liberated Seoul on June 27th last year from the archives of the "Pseudo-Presidential Palace" of Syngman Rhee and the headquarters of the South Korean pseudo-National Defense Army. Most documents in the book are appended with photographs of the originals.

The first part of the book consists of letters between Syngman Rhee and his "Ambassador to the US" Chang Myon, his "Special Envoy to the United Nations" Cho Pyong-ok, his "American friend" Oliver, and his "Diplomatic Advisor" Yoon Byung-koo. In these documents, which they considered "confidential," they shamelessly discussed conspiracies such as "begging for US aid," "secret treaties," and even advancing into Northeast China. The second part contains strategic maps of the US-Syngman Rhee gang's attack on the North, correspondence between Syngman Rhee and Chang Myon, confessions of US intelligence personnel participating in the Syngman Rhee bandit army's massacre of patriotic people, talks by captured South Korean puppet soldiers, and the South Korean puppet army headquarters' Intelligence Bureau's plan for espionage work in 1950. In this part, there are detailed records of how the US-Syngman Rhee gang systematically and cruelly suppressed democratic patriotic movements and how they launched the civil war. The third part begins with a "confidential" report from the US State Department's Intelligence Bureau on the strategic importance of the Korean Peninsula, as well as secret documents between "Ambassador Chang Myon's" advisor J.J. Williams and Chang Myon, and between them and US Pacific Fleet Commander Radford and Syngman Rhee. As early as June 1949, they had already discussed how the US military would use South Korean ports and land and air bases after the start of the Korean War. The fourth part consists of secret documents between Chang Myon, Dulles, and Syngman Rhee regarding Dulles's provocation of war in Korea. Dulles revealed at a reception hosted by "Ambassador" Chang Myon before going to Korea that "this trip is for military purposes."

The book "Documents and Materials Exposing the Provocateurs of the Korean Civil War" is a compilation of the shameless confessions of war profiteers. They originally thought that these "confidential documents" exchanged in the dark would not be known to the Korean people and the people of the world, but now these are not only known to the people of the world, but will also serve as evidence to accuse them of their crimes of aggression against Korea and our country in the court of human justice.

　　朝鲜外务部出版缴获文件
    揭露美李匪帮挑拨内战罪行
    【本报讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务部于一九五○年在平壤用英文出版了《暴露朝鲜内战挑拨者的文件与资料》一书。这本书中所搜集的资料，是美帝国主义指使南朝鲜李承晚卖国集团并直接参加挑拨朝鲜战争最有力的证据。
    书内共刊载了揭露美李匪帮战争罪行的二十九篇文件与资料，除第十五篇为前南朝鲜傀儡政府内务长官金孝锡及第十六篇为前李承晚顾问文学凤向人民投降的悔罪广播外，余二十余篇均为在李承晚的“伪总统府”档案室内及南朝鲜伪国防军总司令部内由朝鲜人民军于去年六月二十七日解放汉城时缴获者。书内大部文件之末均附有原件摄影。
    书的第一部分，是李承晚与他的“驻美大使”张勉、他的“驻联合国特使”赵炳玉、他的“美国友人”奥利伏、他的“外交顾问”尹炳求等往来的函件。他们在这些自认为“机密”的文件中无耻地讨论着“祈求美援”、“秘密条约”，甚至向我国东北进兵的阴谋。第二部分，刊有美李匪帮进攻北部的战略地图，李承晚与张勉的来往函件，美国情报人员参加李承晚匪军屠杀爱国人民的自供，被俘李伪军的谈话以及南朝鲜伪军总部情报局第三厅关于一九五○年的间谍工作计划。在这一部分里，美李匪帮如何有计划地残酷地镇压民主爱国运动，如何发动内战，都有详尽的记录。第三部分开头为美国国务院情报局关于朝鲜半岛战略重要性的“机密”报告，另有“张勉大使”的顾问Ｊ·Ｊ·威廉姆斯和张勉之间以及他们与美国太平洋海军总司令雷德福及李承晚间往来的密件。他们早在一九四九年六月间即已商讨如何在朝鲜战争开始后由美军利用南朝鲜港口及陆空基地的问题。第四部分为张勉、杜勒斯、李承晚之间有关杜勒斯在朝鲜挑拨战争的来往的密件。杜勒斯于赴朝鲜前在张勉“大使”的招待宴会上即已透露出“此行为军事目的”。
    《暴露朝鲜内战挑拨者的文件与资料》一书，集中了战争贩子的无耻供状。他们原认为这些在黑暗中来往的“机密文件”不会为朝鲜人民和世界人民所知晓，但现在这些不仅为全世界人民所知，而且将作为在人类的正义的法庭上控诉他们侵略朝鲜和我国的罪证了。
