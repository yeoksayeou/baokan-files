The Enshi Special District of Hubei Province before liberation was a paradise for Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists and the landlord class, while the vast majority of people often struggled on the verge of starvation. Poor working people wore a single piece of clothing for two or three generations, and rarely ate oil or salt for seven or eight years. Every year, they spent three to six months relying solely on digging and eating bracken roots (wild plants) to survive. Countless people sold their children or wives, or even starved to death, due to hunger. Li Guizhi, a farmer from Chengping Township in Hefeng County, was forced by poverty to sell her four-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter before liberation. In the Jiantian Township area of Enshi, more than a dozen people starved to death every year.

Southwestern Hubei has five major special products: tung oil, tea, lacquer, hemp, and Chinese gallnuts. Although the output was abundant, they could not be exported under the monopoly of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, which forced many tea gardens and hemp fields to switch to growing opium. The small-scale ethnic industrial and commercial enterprises in the small mountain cities also declined and closed down one after another under the economic aggression of American imperialism and the devastation and exploitation of bureaucratic capital. Twenty-two of the more than one hundred shops in Hefeng City closed down before liberation. Small-scale industries in Enshi, such as Zhushaxi Paper Mill, soap factories, leather factories, and soy sauce factories, were squeezed out by the influx of American goods.

In November 1949, all eight counties in the Enshi Special District—Enshi, Jianshi, Badong, Hefeng, Xuan’en, Lichuan, Xianfeng, and Laifeng—were liberated. In the short year since then, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, everything has undergone tremendous changes. Last spring, a vigorous rent reduction and anti-despot movement was launched in the vast countryside, which initially hit and weakened the feudal forces of the landlord class politically and economically. Farmers legally reduced rent grain from landlords by 30 million catties. From July to August, the People's Government purchased mountain products with 10.5 million catties of grain, and used more than 8 million catties of grain as relief loans and low-priced sales, allowing farmers to survive the famine left by the Kuomintang reactionaries and solve the difficulties of production materials. Farmers' enthusiasm for production was therefore very high, reclaiming wasteland and applying fertilizer, resulting in a bumper harvest in the entire region, with an average yield of more than 70% to 80%. The countryside of Enshi Special District, which has been liberated for more than a year, has since taken on a new look. Farmers have been adding agricultural tools to better develop production. Jiucun Village in Enshi added 20 draught cattle and one horse after last year's autumn harvest, and ten families built 27 new houses together. After the autumn harvest, Feijichang Village added more than 150 agricultural tools. Zhou Guoqi, a farmer in Yaque District, used to have clothes that exposed his back, but this year he has already put on two sets of new cloth shirts and trousers. Sounds of joy and laughter filled every farmer's home.

Under the policy of developing production and connecting urban and rural areas, the special district first established and improved state-owned trading institutions, and successively established four specialized companies, one trading company, eight supply and marketing stores, seventeen branches, one tea purchasing station, and four purchasing teams. In addition, the China Tea Company has set up purchasing stations in Hefeng and Enshi counties. With the expansion of the purchase of mountain products and the allocation of daily necessities, by the end of October last year, a total of 1 million catties of tung oil, 300,000 catties of Chinese gallnuts, 180,000 catties of lacquer, 170,000 catties of hemp, 300,000 catties of magnolia bark (medicinal material), more than 1.3 million catties of tea, and many other mountain products were purchased. At the same time, 1.2 million catties of edible salt, 80,000 bolts of native cloth, 100 warps of foreign yarn, 8,000 bolts of fine cloth, and 8 million catties of grain were promoted. In this way, not only was the sales channel for local products solved and farmers were supplied with daily necessities, but also the scissors difference between industrial products and agricultural products was narrowed. Taking Enshi Chengguan District as an example, industrial products only rose by 50% in one year, but agricultural products increased to 240%. With the sales of mountain products, farmers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, so they are all reorganizing their gardens. For example, farmers in Xinling Township, Badong County, planted more than 10,000 tung trees last year. In Hefeng, 70% of the more than 10,000 mu of tea gardens have been processed and fertilized, and 40% have been weeded and pruned once. Each tea tree can produce an average of 1.5 catties of tea, and the output has doubled compared with previous years.

Along with the recovery of urban and rural trade and the development of agricultural production, the industry and commerce of Enshi Special District have gradually become vibrant, and the market has also become prosperous. There are more than 130 applications for resumption of business in Enshi Chengguan District, and 23 in Hefeng County. More than 20 new shops have been opened in Lichuan County. Jinlongba in Xuan'en County has also opened a rural market. Laifeng has changed its market day from once every five days to once every three days. In the past, Jianshi had a proverb that "production is cold in the quiet summer months," but last year was different. There were often people buying things at the door of every store. At the same time, dispersed capital is gradually moving towards concentration, and has already begun to face the countryside. Qunyihua Cloth Shop in Enshi County is composed of six silk and cloth shops. With the loan assistance from the People's Government, small-scale industries are gradually recovering. The umbrella manufacturing industry in Laifeng and Xuan'en has been newly developed. The paper mill newly established in Enshi has started production, and the sulfur mine in Jianshi has now resumed production.

In the past year, the desolate appearance of the counties in Enshi Special District has been transformed into a vibrant and prosperous scene.

　　湖北恩施的复苏
    鹤鸣
    解放前的湖北恩施专区，是国民党官僚资本家和地主阶级的乐园，而广大人民则经常挣扎在饥饿线上。贫苦劳动人民，一件衣服穿两三代，七、八年中很少吃到油、盐。他们每年都有三个月、半年不等的时间，专靠挖吃蕨根（野生植物）度日，为饥饿而卖子鬻妻、甚至饿死的不知道有多少。鹤峰县成坪乡农民李桂芝，解放前就是为生活所迫，把四岁的男孩子和八岁的女孩子卖掉了；恩施见天乡一带，每年要饿死十几个人。
    鄂西南有桐、茶、漆、麻、棓子五大特产，虽然出产丰富，但在国民党官僚资本的垄断下不能出口，因而使很多茶园、麻田被迫改种了鸦片。微小的山城的民族工商业，也在美帝国主义的经济侵略和官僚资本摧残压榨下，日形萧条而纷纷倒闭。一百多家商店的鹤峰城，解放前停业的有二十二家；恩施朱砂溪纸厂、肥皂厂、皮革、酱油厂等小型工业，都在美货充斥下被挤垮了。
    一九四九年十一月间，恩施专区所属恩施、建始、巴东、鹤峰、宣恩、利川、咸丰、来凤八县全部获得了解放。从那时起的短短一年中，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，一切都在起着巨大的变化。广大农村在去年春天掀起了轰轰烈烈的减租反恶霸运动，从政治上、经济上初步打击与削弱了地主阶级的封建势力，农民依法从地主手中减回租粮三千万斤。七、八月间，人民政府又以一千零五十万斤粮食收购山货，以八百多万斤粮食作为救济贷款和低价出售，使农民得以度过了国民党反动派统治时期留下的荒歉，解决了生产资料的困难。农民生产情绪因此很高，开荒、施肥，使全区获得了丰收，各地平均收成达七、八成以上。解放一年多的恩施专区的农村，从此有了新生的气象。农民纷纷添置农具，以更好地发展生产。恩施九中村去年秋收后就添了二十头耕牛，一匹马，有十家共盖了二十七间新房屋；飞机场村在秋收后，添置了一百五十余件农具；鸦鹊区农民周国琪，过去穿的衣裳露着脊梁，今年已经穿上两套新布衫裤子。喜悦和欢笑的声音，漾溢在每个农家。
    在发展生产、沟通城乡关系的方针下，该专区首先建立与健全了国营贸易机构，先后成立了四个专业公司，一个贸易公司，八个供销商店，十七个分店，一个茶叶收购处，四个收购组。另外，中茶公司在鹤峰、恩施两县均设立了收购处。随着展开了山货的收购和日用品的调剂，截至去年十月底，共收购桐油一百万斤，棓子三十万斤，漆十八万斤，麻十七万斤，厚朴（药材）三十万斤，茶叶一百三十多万斤，及其他山货很多。与此同时，并又推销食盐一百二十万斤，土布八万匹，洋纱一百台，细布八千匹，粮食八百万斤。这样一来，不仅解决了土产品的销路，供给了农民生活必需品，并且缩小了工业产品与农业产品的剪刀差额。以恩施城关区为例：一年中间，工业品仅上涨了百分之五十，农产品却提高到百分之二百四十。山货有了销路，农民生产劲头大大提高，因而都在重整园林。如巴东县信陵乡农民，去年栽桐树一万多棵。鹤峰一万多亩茶园，加工施肥的有十分之七，锄一道草修剪一次的有十分之四，每棵茶树平均可产一斤半茶，产量比往年增加一倍。
    伴随着城乡贸易的恢复与农业生产的发展，恩施专区的工商业也逐渐有了生机，市场也繁荣起来了。申请复业的，恩施城关区有一百三十多家，鹤峰县城有二十三家；利川县新开设商店达二十多家。宣恩县金龙坝也开辟了乡场；来凤由五天一次场期改为三天一次场期；建始过去流行有“清歇六月生产冷落”的谚语，去年却不同了，家家商店门口都经常有买东西的人。同时，分散经营的资本，逐渐走向集中，并且已经开始面对农村。恩施县城的群益花纱布店，就是由六家绸布店组成的。在人民政府贷款扶助下，小型工业也逐步恢复，来凤、宣恩的造伞业，已经得到新的发展；恩施新创办的造纸厂已经开了工；建始的硫磺矿，现已恢复生产。
    恩施专区各县的荒凉面貌，一年以来，已经改变成为生气蓬勃的繁荣景象了。
