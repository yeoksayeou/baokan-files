Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 6th: The rapid growth of the democratic forces of the Japanese people has caused extreme panic among the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. After Yoshida's government's special investigation bureau unreasonably closed the democratic newspaper "Voice of Peace" on January 23rd, it again, on the 4th, with the assistance of a large number of police, extensively searched 424 distribution points of the newspaper and other progressive newspapers across the country, and illegally arrested those whom the bureau considered to be in charge of these distribution points, including regional committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, totaling 382 people. Kyodo News reported that such a large-scale arrest of JCP members and other democrats "is the first time since the war." This large-scale arrest occurred while the U.S. imperialist Dulles was in Tokyo agitating to rearm Japanese militarist forces, fully demonstrating that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are so lacking in confidence in their conspiracy that they delusionally hope to reduce resistance through arrests.

    逮捕日共党员及民主分子三百八十多人
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本人民民主力量的迅速增长，引起了美日反动派的极度恐慌。吉田政府的特务机关特别审查局于一月二十三日无理封闭民主报纸《和平之声》后，又于四日在大批警察的协助下，大肆搜查全国各地的该报及其他进步报纸的发行所四百二十四处，并非法逮捕该局认为是这些发行所的负责人，包括日共各地区委员在内，共达三百八十二人。共同社称：对日共党员及其他民主分子如此大规模的逮捕，“还是战后第一次”。此次大规模的逮捕正发生在美帝国主义分子杜勒斯正在东京活动重新武装日本军国主义势力的时候，充分表明了美日反动派对自己的阴谋如此缺乏信心，以致妄想用逮捕来减少阻力。
