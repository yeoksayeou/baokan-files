The phenomenon of commodity tax evasion is quite serious in Hubei Province. According to the Shadaguan Tax Office of Songzi County, the Fuchengchun Oil Press evaded 8,300 jin of oil tax in the autumn, accounting for 75% of the taxed oil. The Xiaogan County Tax Bureau discovered that the Yu Shaoji Grocery Store had a true account book, and the evaded business volume was seven times the reported business volume. In Yichang City, 76 cases of violations were discovered in one Sunday.

In the tax investigation, various places have found that mobilizing the masses to secretly report has been very effective. For example, when Yichang City was investigating and evaluating the autumn turnover, Fu Yumin, chairman of the New Medicine Industry, attempted to use wine and women to corrupt Ding Yushan, Yang Xieji, Zhou Bolin, and other shop assistants who were inspecting and assessing taxes, in order to achieve the industry's collective underreporting of 175 million yuan in turnover (accounting for 30% of the self-reported amount). However, this failed due to a secret report from the masses. With the assistance of the masses, Huanggang Tuanfeng Town discovered false accounts of five households, including Yu Kang, and the evaded turnover accounted for 53.2% to 114% of the self-reported turnover. In the Southern Goods and other five industries involving 79 households alone, 502 false account books were found.

Organizing active village cadres to establish tax inspection teams in rural areas can also play a certain role. For example, in Zigui County, due to the establishment of tax teams, 779 heads of pigs and sheep, 89 distilleries, and 4 paper mills evading taxes were discovered within half a month. Now, 124 tax collection groups have been established in Zhuxi County, achieving great results.

From the above specific facts, it can be seen that merchants have countless tricks for evading taxes, and they are constantly innovating. In addition to strengthening the work of tax cadres, we must rely closely on the masses to eliminate illegal acts of smuggling and tax evasion.

　　依靠群众检查漏税
    湖北省货物税漏税现象相当严重。据松滋县沙道观税务所查获阜成椿榨坊秋季偷漏油税八千三百斤，占已税油的百分之七十五。孝感县税局查获喻少记杂货铺真账一本，偷漏营业额达自报营业额的七倍。宜昌市在某星期日一天中，即查获违章案件七十六起。
    各地在查税中，发动群众密报收效很大。如宜昌市查评秋季营业额时，新药业理事长傅裕民企图以酒色腐化检查评税的店员丁玉山、杨燮基、周伯麟等人，以达到该业集体瞒报营业额一亿七千五百万元的企图（占自报额的百分之三十），后因群众报密未果。黄冈团风镇经群众协助，查出裕康等五户假账，计偷漏营业额占自报营业额的百分之五十三点二到百分之一百一十四。仅南货等五业七十九户中，就查出五百零二本假账。
    在农村组织积极的村干部建立税务检查小组，也能起一定的作用。如秭归县由于建立了税务小组，在半个月内查出漏税猪羊七百七十九头，槽坊漏税八十九户及纸厂四户。现竹溪县已建立了一二四个税务稽征组，获得很大成绩。
    从以上具体事实看来，商人偷税花样不胜枚举，并且日益翻新，我们除加强税务干部的工作外，必须紧紧依靠群众，才能杜绝走私偷漏税的非法行为。
