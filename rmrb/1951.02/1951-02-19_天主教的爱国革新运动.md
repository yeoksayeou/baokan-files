　　The Patriotic Reform Movement of the Catholic Church
　　Liu Guanghua
    The patriotic reform movement of Catholic believers has begun to develop gradually and extensively from the bottom up over the past two months.

    Following the initial unfolding of the reform movement in Christianity, patriotic Catholics also began to initiate a self-reliance reform movement. At the end of November 1950, Father Wang Liangzuo of Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, and more than 500 other Catholics first published the "Declaration of the Catholic Self-Reliance Reform Movement," calling on Catholics throughout the country to launch a self-reliance reform movement, eliminate pro-American, obsequious-American, and fear-of-American thoughts, rely on their own efforts, and establish a new church that is autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating. Their call quickly received enthusiastic responses from patriotic Catholic believers in various places.

    In the Southwest Region: Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing Diocese, Liu Zongyu, chief secretary of the bishop's office, and 695 others, Wang Wencheng, bishop of the Nanchong Diocese in northern Sichuan, Zong Bingliang, deputy bishop, and 331 others, as well as Catholics in Yingshan, Tongnan, Anyue in northern Sichuan and Yibin and Luxian in southern Sichuan, successively published self-reliance reform declarations in response to the call of the Guangyuan Catholics. The Chongqing Diocese declaration called on Catholics to support the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and completely sever ties with imperialism. The Nanchong Diocese declaration explicitly stated that it would fundamentally transform the Catholic Church in China based on the basic principle of Chinese people propagating the gospel themselves, and expressed its determination to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements within the church who were willing to serve imperialism. The reform declarations of Catholics in other places all proposed that Catholics should strive to strengthen political study, transform themselves, actively participate in productive labor, and overcome all difficulties that the church itself might encounter in the process of reform. As of February 10, seven dioceses and twenty-five cities and counties in the Southwest Region had 7,550 Catholics who had published self-reliance reform declarations and signed the declarations, including 68 priests (presbyters).

    In the North China Region: More than 600 Catholics in Guihua City, led by Ma Dianru and others, published a self-reliance reform declaration on December 9th of last year, pointing out that the vast majority of Chinese Catholics are poor working people who are determined not to be slaves of American imperialism, and will take practical actions to support the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country together with the people of the whole country. Fu Tingwei, deputy bishop of the Suixi Diocese, and priests Sun Zhongxian and Zhou Qizhi jointly published a reform declaration on January 6th, and more than 1,200 Catholics from nearby villages signed it that afternoon. Gao Yiqian, a priest from the Laopingdiquan Church in the Suidong Diocese, and more than 800 other Catholics, as well as Catholics in Baotou City in the Suizhong Diocese, successively published reform declarations. The "Suiyuan Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Promotion Association" was organized in Suiyuan Province, led by Hu Ruhan, Gao Ruoshan, and Zhu Qing, to unify the reform movement of 120,000 Catholics in three dioceses.

    Tian Fengting, deputy bishop of the Zhangjiazhuang Main Church in the Xianxian Diocese of Hebei, published a patriotic reform movement declaration on January 13th, pointing out the fact that imperialism was using churches for espionage activities, and calling on Catholics to participate in the Catholic reform movement and the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Within five days of the declaration being issued, more than 1,200 Catholics had signed it in agreement. Luo Bobin, acting bishop of the Baoding Catholic Church, priests Chen Liang and Han Du, and nuns and Catholics, a total of more than 600 people, issued a declaration in response to the reform movement, opposing Austin's shameless slander.

    Wu Kezhai, former manager of the Yishibao and a leader of the Tianjin Catholic Church, and Zhang Yushi, chairman of the Fahua School, organized a preparatory committee for the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, and issued a declaration denouncing the church, which was being used by imperialism, for hindering China's independence and freedom, and being the Pharisees that Jesus condemned, demanding that the Catholic Church eliminate these dregs. In total, more than 3,400 Catholics in seven areas in the North China Region have signed the reform declaration.

    In the Northwest Region: Han Jizhen, an 80-year-old priest from the Tianshui Diocese in Gansu, Zhao Jingnong, a priest from the Qingshui Church, Huang Letian, the chief priest of the Tianshui Dongguan Main Church, and Wang Wenzhou, a priest from the Mapaoquan Church, and 36 others published the "Declaration of the Tianshui Diocese Responding to the Reform Movement" on January 19th, calling on more than 8,000 Catholics in 20 churches and 53 branch churches in southern Gansu to participate in the movement.

    In the East China Region: Father Wang Keqian, Zhao Wanwen, and more than 120 nuns and Catholics from the Hangzhou Archdiocese formed a reform committee and jointly issued a reform declaration on January 17th, calling on all Catholics in Zhejiang to resolutely sever ties with imperialism, strengthen vigilance, and guard against division.

    In the Central South Region: Father Gong Suya, Wu Huaihui, Liu Qiufen, and 420 Catholics from Shashi, Hubei, jointly issued a declaration on January 21st, supporting the church reform movement. Catholics in Guangzhou City established a temporary working committee to promote self-reliance reform on January 20th, and elected 27 Catholic leaders, including Chen Yixin, deputy bishop of the Guangzhou Diocese, and Father Lian Mingde, as members, and issued a declaration supporting the reform movement. 894 Catholics in Nanchang have signed the reform declaration. The Hainan Diocese formed a preparatory committee for the anti-American reform movement in the Hainan Diocese, composed of nine church leaders, including Father Huang Zhongwen and Han Tiecheng, and held a meeting on January 21st to issue a three-self reform declaration.

    The reform movement spontaneously carried out by the vast number of patriotic Catholics has been warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country and has received the utmost support and encouragement from the people's own government. On January 20th, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council invited more than 40 Catholic leaders from the North China Region to hold a symposium to exchange views on the Catholic reform movement. This meeting was a great encouragement to the Catholic reform movement. Li Junwu, deputy bishop of the Cardinal Bishop's Office, said at the meeting: The policy of freedom of religious belief of the People's Government has been fully proven by the facts of the past year, and we must support and obey the various policies of the People's Government.

    The "Decision on the Policy of Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies" and the "Registration Regulations for Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving Foreign Subsidies and Foreign Investment" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government at the end of December last year have greatly promoted the self-reliance reform movement of Christianity and Catholicism, because the Government Administration Council's decision clearly announced: "Chinese religious groups receiving American subsidies should be transformed into groups completely run by Chinese Catholics, and the government should encourage their self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation movement." After the above two measures of the Government Administration Council were announced, Catholic schools, hospitals, and other institutions in various places, led by Jin Gu and Aurora University (Furen University had been taken over by the government in advance due to unreasonable interference by foreign priests), rushed to register in accordance with the instructions, and successively held denunciations and accusations of the crimes of foreign priests and national Catholic scum.

    These accusations prove that the imperialist elements and their running dogs in the Catholic Church are trying to sabotage the Chinese revolution and the self-reliance reform movement of patriotic Catholics in China. For example, at a teachers and students meeting at Aurora University in Shanghai on January 28th, students revealed and accused Peng Liansan (French), dean of the Law School, of distorting history, describing imperialist aggression against China as voluntary by the Chinese people, provoking Sino-Soviet friendship, drawing national boundaries between Tibet, Xinjiang, and other territories of our country on the map, and using tuition subsidies to induce students not to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and other counter-revolutionary crimes. Students of St. Joseph's Girls' High School in Hankou accused Cai Xiudao, Father Feng, and other scum of oppressing the people and treating students rudely. Catholics in Wuhan reported that Liu Hede, deputy bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hubei, confused anti-imperialism with so-called anti-religion, attempting to provoke Catholics to oppose their motherland and sabotage the Catholic reform movement.

    The Catholic reform movement is developing in the patriotic upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea. The vast number of Catholics in various places are joining the patriotic ranks of the movement to resist America and aid Korea day by day. More than 7,000 Catholics in Chengdu, Luzhou, Nanchong, Jiujiang, Yichang, Shashi, Zhangjiakou, Hainan Island, and other places held anti-American and aid-Korea rallies and demonstrations successively between December last year and January this year. Catholics in the Yan'an Diocese in northern Shaanxi, Changle County in Fujian, and the Taiyuan Diocese held anti-American and aid-Korea symposiums or representative meetings. Catholics in Guiyang, Xuanhua and Shangyi County in Chahar, Taiyuan, and other places successively issued patriotic declarations to resist America and aid Korea. Among them, 4,800 Catholics signed in the Xuanhua, Shangyi, and Taiyuan Dioceses. The 50 nuns of the Zhangjiazhuang Main Church in Xianxian also made a comfort bag and a pair of socks for each of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    In many places, in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and religious reform, Catholics have begun to abandon their previous prejudices and unite with Christians. When religious circles in Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming, Jinan, Xi'an, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Qingdao, and other places held large-scale demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea, Catholics and Christians joined hands under the same banner, shouted patriotic and self-reliant slogans to resist America and aid Korea, and jointly issued various patriotic declarations.

    So far, the patriotic reform movement of the Catholic Church is only beginning to develop, and its scale is not large. It is also necessary to expose and overcome various resistance and sabotage attempts by reactionary elements influenced by imperialism in order to move forward by leaps and bounds. However, the vast majority of the approximately three million Catholics in China are hardworking, poor, and patriotic people, and their patriotic political consciousness is rapidly improving. They are increasingly recognizing the reactionary face of the Vatican and the crimes of using the Chinese Catholic Church for espionage activities. They are determined not to let the Catholic patriotic reform movement fall behind, and their patriotic reform movement is warmly welcomed, supported, and encouraged by the people of the whole country and the People's Government. Because of these, the Catholic patriotic reform movement will surely develop rapidly and achieve victory.

　　天主教的爱国革新运动
　　刘光华
    天主教教徒的爱国革新运动，在过去两个多月以来已开始自下而上地逐渐广泛地发展。
    在基督教的革新运动初步展开之后，天主教的爱国教徒也开始发起自立革新运动。一九五○年十一月底，川北广元县王良佐神父等五百多天主教徒首先发表了《天主教徒自立革新运动宣言》，号召全国各地教友展开自立革新运动，肃清亲美、媚美、恐美的思想，自力更生，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。他们的号召，迅即获得各地天主教爱国信徒们的纷纷响应。
    在西南区：重庆教区代理主教石明亮、主教公署主任秘书刘宗渔等六百九十五人，川北南充教区主教王文成、副主教宗炳亮等三百三十一人，以及川北营山、潼南、安岳及川南宜宾、泸县等地的天主教徒，先后发表自立革新宣言，响应广元教徒的号召。重庆教区的宣言，号召教友拥护人民政协共同纲领，彻底割断与帝国主义的联系。南充教区的宣言明确地表示，将本着中国人自己传教的基本原则来根本改造中国的天主教，并表示要坚决清除教会内甘心为帝国主义服务的反革命分子。其他各地天主教徒的革新宣言都提出了天主教徒应努力加强政治学习，改造自己，积极参加生产劳动，克服教会本身在革新过程中可能遭遇的一切困难。西南区迄二月十日为止已有七个教区，二十五个市县的天主教徒七千五百五十人发表了自立革新宣言和在宣言上签名，其中包括了六十八位神父（司铎）在内。
    在华北区：归绥市的天主教徒六百多人，由马殿如等为首，于去年十二月九日发表自立革新宣言，指出中国天主教徒中绝多数是贫苦的劳动人民，决不甘心做美帝的奴隶，要以实际行动和全国人民一齐来支持抗美援朝保家卫国运动。绥西教区副主教傅亭维，司铎孙仲贤、周其智等联衔在一月六日发表革新宣言，当日下午便有附近各村的教徒一千二百余人签名。绥东教区老平地泉教堂神父高益谦等教徒八百余人，以及绥中教区包头市的天主教徒都先后发表了革新宣言。绥远全省以胡濡汉、高若山、朱清等为首组织了“绥远天主教徒三自爱国促进会”，统一领导三个教区十二万教徒的革新运动。
    河北献县教区张家庄总堂副主教田凤亭等于一月十三日发表爱国革新运动宣言，指出帝国主义假借教堂进行间谍活动的事实，号召教徒一齐参加天主教革新运动和抗美援朝的运动。在宣言发出五日之内，便有一千二百多位教徒签名赞成。保定天主教堂代理主教骆伯宾，司铎陈良、韩度及修女、教徒等六百余人发表宣言响应革新运动，反对奥斯汀的无耻谰言。
    天津天主教领袖前益世报经理吴克斋，法华学校董事长张羽时等组织了天津天主教革新运动促进会筹备会，发表宣言指斥受帝国主义利用的教会阻碍了中国的独立自由，正是耶稣所指责的法利赛人，要求天主教会把这些败类给清除出去。共计华北区已有七个地区的三千四百以上的教徒在革新宣言上签名。
    在西北区：甘肃天水教区的八十岁老司铎韩济真，清水教堂司铎赵经农，天水东关总堂主任司铎黄乐天，马跑泉教堂司铎王文舟等三十六人于一月十九日发表《天水教区响应革新运动宣言》，号召陇南二十座教堂，五十三个分堂的八千多教友参加运动。
    在华东区：杭州总主教区神父王克谦，赵宛文及修女教友一百二十几位成立了革新委员会，于一月十七日联名发表革新宣言，号召全浙教友坚决割断与帝国主义的联系，加强警惕，谨防分化。
    在中南区：湖北沙市神父龚苏亚、吴怀辉、刘秋芬及教徒四百二十人于一月二十一日联名发表宣言，拥护教会革新运动。广州市天主教徒于一月二十日成立促进自力革新临时工作委员会，推选广州教区副主教陈易新、神父连明德等二十七位天主教领袖为委员，发表宣言拥护革新运动。南昌天主教徒已有八百九十四人在革新宣言上签名。海南教区以神父黄中文、韩铁城等九位教会领袖组成海南教区反美革新运动筹备委员会，并于一月二十一日集会发表三自革新宣言。
    天主教爱国的广大教徒所自发地进行的革新运动，受到全国人民的热烈欢迎，并得到人民自己的政府的竭力支持和鼓励。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会于一月二十日邀请华北区天主教领袖四十余人，举行座谈会，交换对天主教革新运动的意见。这个集会对天主教的革新运动是一个极大的鼓舞。会上枢机主教公署副主教李君武说：人民政府信仰自由的政策已由一年来的事实完全证明，我们要拥护和服从人民政府的各项政策。
    中央人民政府政务院于去年十二月底发表的《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》和《接受外国津贴及外资经营之文化教育救济机关及宗教团体登记条例》，对于基督教和天主教的自立革新运动都有很大的促进作用，因为政务院决定中，明确宣布：“接受美国津贴之中国宗教团体，应使之改变为中国教徒完全自办的团体，政府对于他们的自立自养自传运动应予以鼓励。”在政务院上述两项措施公布后，以津沽、震旦大学为首的各地天主教学校医院等机构（辅仁大学已在事先由于受外国教士的无理干涉而经政府接管）都抢先按照指令办理登记，并且纷纷举行对外国教士及国籍天主教败类的罪行的检举和控诉。
    这些控诉证明，天主教会中的帝国主义分子及其走狗，力图破坏中国革命，力图破坏中国天主教爱国教徒的自立革新运动。例如上海震旦大学在一月二十八日的师生大会上，学生们揭露并控诉了法学院长彭廉三（法籍）歪曲史实，把帝国主义侵略中国说成中国人民自愿，挑拨中苏友谊，将地图上西藏、新疆与我国其他领土之间划上国界线，并以补助学费来劝诱学生不参加中国新民主主义青年团等项反革命罪行。汉口圣若瑟女中的学生控诉了蔡修道、凤神父等败类欺压人民，蛮横对待学生等罪恶。武汉天主教徒检举了湖北天主教教区副主教刘和德把反帝国主义与所谓反宗教混为一谈，企图挑拨天主教徒反对祖国，并破坏天主教革新运动的罪恶行为。
    天主教革新运动是在抗美援朝的爱国高潮中发展起来的。各地广大的天主教徒一天天站到抗美援朝运动的爱国行列中来。成都、泸州、南充、九江、宜昌、沙市、张家口、海南岛等地天主教徒共七千余人，于去年十二月和今年一月间先后举行了抗美援朝大会和示威游行。陕北延安教区、福建长乐县、太原教区等地天主教徒分别举行了抗美援朝座谈会或代表会议。贵阳、察哈尔宣化及尚义县、太原等地天主教徒先后发表抗美援朝爱国宣言。其中宣化、尚义、太原教区即有教徒四千八百人签名。献县张家庄总堂的五十名修女每人还做了一个慰问袋和一双袜子献给中国人民志愿军。
    在许多地方的抗美援朝和宗教革新运动中，天主教徒开始捐弃了以往的成见而和基督教徒团结起来了。在北京、武汉、昆明、济南、西安、重庆、杭州、开封、新乡、青岛各地宗教界举行抗美援朝示威大游行时，天主教徒和基督教徒在同一旗帜下携手并进，同声高呼抗美援朝爱国自立的口号，联合发出各种爱国宣言。
    到目前为止，天主教的爱国革新运动，还仅仅是开始发展，其规模还是不大的，还要揭破和克服受帝国主义影响的反动分子的各种阻力和破坏企图，才能大步前进。但是全中国约三百万的天主教徒的绝大多数都是勤劳的、贫苦的、爱国的人民，而且他们的爱国的政治觉悟正在迅速提高，他们正日益认清梵蒂冈教廷的反动面目，利用中国天主教会从事间谍活动的罪恶。他们决不愿意让天主教爱国革新运动落在后面，而他们的爱国革新运动又受着全国人民和人民政府的热烈欢迎、支持和鼓励。因为这些，天主教的爱国革新运动是一定会迅速发展起来，并取得胜利的。
