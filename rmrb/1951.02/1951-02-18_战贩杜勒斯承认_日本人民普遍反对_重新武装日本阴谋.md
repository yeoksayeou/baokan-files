　　War-Profiteer Dulles Admits
　　Japanese People Generally Oppose Conspiracy to Rearm Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 17th] The war-monger Dulles had to admit the fact that the Japanese people universally oppose rearmament. Dulles told reporters in Canberra, the capital of Australia, on the 15th: "In Japan, I received tens of thousands of letters from individuals or groups... All these letters opposed rearmament." He revealed that "some of these letters were resolutions from chambers of commerce, trade unions, religious, and technical groups." Dulles admitted that he had not received a single letter suggesting the rearmament of Japan. The Japanese people are "emotionally ardent advocates of peace."
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 16th] TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th: The stay of the war-monger Dulles in Japan has made the protest movement against the American armament of Japan and against the conclusion of a separate peace treaty even more turbulent. The Japanese democratic newspaper "Go To The Masses" stated that the labor union of Tokyo's Yamato Electric Company unanimously passed a resolution demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupation forces. This union had held a protest strike against Dulles' visit to Japan. The Tokyo branch of the Metal Workers Union also demanded the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and protested against the armament of Japan.
    While Dulles was staying in Tokyo, leaflets and slogans protesting Dulles' activities appeared on the walls of many buildings.

　　战贩杜勒斯承认
　  日本人民普遍反对  重新武装日本阴谋
    【新华社十七日讯】日本人民普遍反对重新武装的事实，就连战争贩子杜勒斯也不得不承认。杜勒斯十五日在澳大利亚首都堪培拉对记者说：“在日本，我接到成千成万的个人或团体的信件……所有这些信都反对重新武装”。他透露：在这些信中，“有若干是商会、工会、宗教和技术团体的决议”。杜勒斯承认：他没有接到一封建议重新武装日本的信。日本人民“在情绪上是热烈主张和平的”。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社十五日电引东京消息：战争贩子杜勒斯在日本的逗留，使得反对美国武装日本与反对缔结单独和约的抗议运动更为汹涌澎湃。日本民主报纸《到群众中去》称，东京山户电气公司工人工会一致通过决议，要求订立全面和约并撤退占领军。这个工会曾举行抗议罢工，反对杜勒斯的访问日本。金属工人联合会东京分会也要求订立全面和约并抗议武装日本。
    当杜勒斯逗留在东京的时候，抗议杜勒斯前来活动的传单与标语，出现在许多建筑物的墙壁上。
