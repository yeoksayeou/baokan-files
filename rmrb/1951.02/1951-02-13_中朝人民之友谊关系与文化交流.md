　　China and Korea share a common border of over a thousand miles and are truly as close as lips and teeth. For two thousand years, the Chinese and Korean nations have been inextricably linked, whether culturally, economically, or militarily. Although in Chinese history, some rulers, to satisfy their ambitions, invaded this neighbor across the river several times, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples has always been maintained, unaffected by the wars of aggression launched by emperors. In the past thirty years, for the sake of national liberation, the people of China and Korea, under the leadership of the working-class parties, have united more closely to fight against the common enemy, the imperialist aggressors. After Japan annexed Korea, many Korean revolutionary patriots came to China to carry out activities. Many resistances based in China also played a certain role. After September 18th Incident, many Korean comrades participated in the early anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Northeast China. In 1936, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established. The predecessors of its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Armies were guerrilla units jointly formed by Chinese and Korean Communists, led by them. General Kim Il-sung, the premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is an outstanding leader of the Korean people's anti-Japanese struggle. The guerrilla division he commanded cooperated with the Chinese people's army in many campaigns. Many Korean comrades shed their blood on Chinese soil in our War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The unity of great internationalism and noble patriotism is manifested everywhere.

　　When US imperialism launched the war of aggression in Korea last June, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the 475 million Chinese people, first warned the US imperialist aggressors, saying: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they allow the imperialists to肆行侵略 against their neighbors and ignore it!" On November 4, the democratic parties issued a joint declaration, which stated more clearly and forcefully: "Historical facts have long told us that the survival of Korea is closely related to the safety of China. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold; if the house is broken, the hall will be in danger. The Chinese people's support for the Korean people's war against US aggression is not only a moral responsibility but also closely related to the vital interests of all our people and is determined by the necessity of self-defense." The people of the whole country widely and enthusiastically demanded to resist US imperialism and support Korea through voluntary actions, and formed the Volunteer Army to cross the Yalu River. The Chinese and Korean peoples, who had been close comrades-in-arms for thirty years, once again fought side by side, quickly defeating the US imperialist invading army and achieving a decisive victory. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wrote many heroic and tragic deeds with their blood. The flesh-and-blood friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples are gloriously and fully manifested! This friendship is not accidental, it has its historical background. A review of the relationship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Korean peoples over the past two thousand years can help us understand the current situation and consolidate the friendship between these two historically related nations.

　　Long before recorded history, the Chinese and Korean peoples already had closely related cultures. Korea has dolmens made of large stacked stones, especially in the southwest, with the same shape as those found on the Liaodong Peninsula and Shandong Peninsula in China. The stone coffins of primitive ancient tombs are also common to Korea and Northeast China. Korea has legends of egg-born ancestors, and the ancient Shang people of China also said that their ancestor was born from his mother swallowing the egg of a black bird. Furthermore, examining the Korean people's clothing, food, and housing, we can also see the connection with the various Chinese ethnic groups. Since the 7th century, Koreans, both men and women, have often worn white clothes, a custom that remains unchanged to this day. And in China, the ancient Fuyu tribe in the Northeast wore white clothes, and the Jurchen people also liked to wear white clothes. It was probably only later that they changed under the influence of the Han people. In terms of food, the main food of Koreans is rice, followed by wheat and millet, which is similar to China. Korean families mostly use earth bricks to build heated platforms, and in winter they light a fire from the pit below. This custom can be traced back to the 7th century, as mentioned in both the Old and New Tang Books of the Goryeo (高麗) biography. The Jurchen also had the same method. "Digging soil for beds, heating the fire below, and sleeping, eating, and living on top." At that time, it was called 'keng' (坑) (also written as 'kang' 炕). Even today, northern China still inherits this name and the custom it represents. These facts all show that before the Chinese and Korean peoples consciously helped each other, they already had a good material foundation for building their long-lasting friendship.

　　The Records of the Grand Historian (史记) records that at the beginning of the Han Dynasty, a man from the Yan state named Wei Man (卫满) "fled", gathering a party of more than a thousand people. He drove out the Korean king Gija (箕准) and declared himself king. He gathered fugitives from Yan and Qi and established his capital in Wanggeom-seong (王险城) (now Pyongyang). By the time of his grandson, he recruited more and more "fugitives" from the Han Dynasty. The so-called "fugitives" were people who could not bear the exploitation of the feudal rulers and fled. Therefore, the northern part of Korea had an early relationship with the oppressed people of China. The site of the Lelang Commandery (乐浪郡) (south bank of the Taedong River in Pyongyang) during the Han Dynasty has unearthed Han tombs, which contain many lacquerware, woodenware, metalware, and other funerary objects. From the inscriptions on the lacquerware, it is known that they were products of Sichuan from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD. The exquisite handicrafts created by the Chinese working people had already spread to Korea two thousand years ago. Yang Xiong's record of dialects, based on very ancient materials, shows that "the area between Yan's northeast, Korea, and the Ye River (冽水)" formed a separate region. From the similarity of dialects, one can imagine that in the Qin and Han dynasties, many immigrants from Yan's northeast must have migrated to Korea.

　　The Chinese people living in Korea have contributed to Korea in politics, culture, and national defense. Let us take the example of the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392). Shuang Ji (双冀), a Zhou dynasty Wusheng Army Jiedushi inspection officer, stayed in Korea due to illness while following an envoy. In 958, he suggested imitating the Tang Dynasty to establish the imperial examination system, testing poetry, fu, odes, and current affairs strategies, as well as medicine, divination, geography, law, calligraphy, and arithmetic, etc. The imperial examination system was implemented for hundreds of years thereafter. Zhou Zhu (周伫) from Wenzhou, Liu Zai (刘载) from Quanzhou, and Hu Zongdan (胡宗旦) from Fuzhou in the Song Dynasty all went to Korea with merchant ships and stayed to become officials. Shen Xiu (慎修) from Kaifeng was knowledgeable and skilled in medicine, and rose to the position of Left Vice Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonies and Deputy Chief Councilor. His son Anzhi (安之) served as a local official and presided over the drafting of diplomatic documents with both the northern and southern sides of China. Chen Wei (陈渭), a Song Dynasty Jinshi, was appointed as a Secretary of the Secretariat due to his literary talent. Xiao Ding (萧鼎), Xiao Qian (萧迁), and Ye Sheng (叶盛) were proficient in music and introduced Song Dynasty music to Korea. Tian Sheng (田盛) was retained in Korea for his good calligraphy skills, and Dong Yang (东养) for his martial arts skills, and they were "given official positions to encourage others to come." Lin Wan (林完) served as the Director of the Imperial Academy and submitted a memorial requesting the prohibition of powerful people from "exploiting and demanding things by relying on their power." He advised the king not to "exhaust the people and cause resentment." Luo Shi (罗世) of the Yuan Dynasty served as the Supreme Commander of Jeolla Province. When Japanese invaders came in more than fifty ships and landed on Haengan Mountain with over a thousand infantry and cavalry, Luo Shi led his troops to surround and attack them from all sides, defeating the invaders greatly. When he was transferred to the Kaesong Prefecture, Japanese invaders attacked Ganghwa several times, but he repelled them all. Later, 500 Japanese ships entered the town of Jinpo, "landing on the shore and dispersing into the prefectures, wantonly burning and looting, with corpses covering the mountains and fields. They transferred grain to their ships, and the rice was discarded on the ground, a foot thick." Luo Shi attacked the Japanese ships with cannons, "the smoke and flames soared into the sky, and the thieves guarding the ships were burned to death," and they fled in defeat. Bian Anlie (边安烈) from Shenyang also participated in the two battles of Haengan Mountain and Jinpo. Later, he assisted Yi Seong-gye in defeating the Japanese at Namwon. When Japanese pirates attacked Danyang County, Anlie defeated them, beheading over eighty heads. He also defeated the Japanese at Andong, beheading over thirty heads. This was at the end of the 14th century, and the Chinese people had already participated in the Korean people's struggle to defend their country against foreign aggression.

　　In addition to the Han people, other fraternal ethnic groups also formed settlements in Korea and lived peacefully with the Korean people. Historically, Koreans often had Khitans "coming to surrender," and the places where the Khitan people lived and cultivated were called Khitan farms. In 1117, Khitans who had surrendered and scattered around Seoul gathered together to play Khitan songs, dances, and miscellaneous plays to welcome the Korean king. The Khitan, Wi Diao (尉貂), is listed in the Goryeo History's biography of filial piety. The Jurchen also often "came to surrender," often forming their own tribes. If "people of the same kind offended each other, they would each follow their native customs." Mongols also stayed in Korea. Qi Changshou (契长寿) of the Uyghur族moved to Korea in the mid-14th century. Qi Changshou once suggested a plan to resist Japanese aggression, believing that the past strategy of clearing the fields was not beneficial to the people. He advocated "building castles according to the number of households, with two to three hundred families as a rate, and setting up officials to guard them. Let them live in houses connected to each other, barely accommodating the crowd. Except for the houses, only leave the grain field... All castle trenches should be high and deep, with towers on top and drawbridges at the gates. Other defensive equipment should be arranged as appropriate. Dig small pits in the shape of 品between the castle trenches, and plant deer antlers to stop traffic... When the grain is ripe, it should be harvested and transported as soon as possible, without delay. If thieves arrive, the young and strong should climb the city walls, and the old and weak should provide food." He also analyzed the situation of the Japanese pirates, saying: "The thieves come and go depending on the tide, not wanting to attack cities and seize land to plan for a long time. They only have looting in mind. Since there is nothing to gain, they will inevitably retreat." His observations and suggestions were very correct, and later the people along the southeast coast of the Ming Dynasty often adopted this method to resist and defeat the Japanese. Unfortunately, it was not adopted at that time. The Qi family has been passed down from generation to generation, and today there are still their descendants in Jeolla Province. From these fragmented materials, we can at least know that many ethnic groups in China have had close relations with the Korean people at different times.

　　Let's take a look at the Korean people who came to China. Some of them formed ethnic minorities within China, living and working in peace and contentment. Some have left their names in Chinese history. Some returned to Korea and played a significant role in cultural exchange. In a nutshell, these Korean people who came to China have promoted the friendly relations between China and Korea in various ways.

　　In 668, 28,000 households of Goguryeo people moved to areas south of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, south of the mountains, and west of the capital. In the mid-9th century, many Koreans lived in coastal areas of Jiangdu, Huai'an, and Donghai counties in Jiangsu, and Muping, Haiyang, Wendeng, and Rongcheng counties in Shandong. At that time, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula, so the places where they lived were called Silla Neighborhoods, with officials in charge of Silla affairs. When Japanese envoys returned to their country, they often hired Silla ships and sailors from the Silla Neighborhoods because their own ships were not strong enough. They probably traveled frequently between the coastal areas of Jiangsu, the Shandong Peninsula, and the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese monk Ennin (圆仁) came to Tang China and met more than a dozen Silla people in Donghai County, who were carrying charcoal from Zhucheng, Shandong, to Huai'an. They led Ennin to stay in a Silla family's house. Ennin hired a Silla carriage while traveling, rode on a Silla charcoal-carrying ship, and received the care of a Silla "translator." The Hokke-in temple built by Silla people is located in Chishan, Wendeng, with twenty-four resident monks and three nuns. 法会are often held in accordance with Silla customs, and sermons and repentances are given in their native language. Ennin went to listen to the sermons on the 14th and 15th days of the first month, and more than two hundred men, women, and children from Silla participated each day. From Ennin's diary, it can be seen that these Korean minorities lived peacefully and happily in China. In 816, there was a famine in Silla, and 170 people crossed the sea to Zhejiang to seek food. This also tells us about the frequent maritime traffic between China and Korea at that time, and the friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Although pirates often plundered the good people of Silla and sold them to China as slaves, in 823 the Tang Dynasty issued an order to prohibit this and sent those already in China back with funds.

　　Around 840, about 150 Silla "hostages" and students stayed in Chang'an. Like the Japanese students at the time, they made great efforts in absorbing Tang Dynasty culture. From the 9th century to the mid-10th century, for about 150 years, about 90 Koreans passed the imperial examinations in China. There was a man named Choi Chiwon (崔致远) who came to Tang China with a merchant ship at the age of twelve and passed the Jinshi examination at the age of eighteen. After returning to Silla, his poetry, prose, and calligraphy had a great influence. During the Five Dynasties, Choi Eonhui (崔彦撝) went to China to study at the age of eighteen and returned to his country at the age of forty-two, becoming a Grand Academician, and young people all studied under him. One of his sons traveled to Jin and then to Khitan, where he was used for his talent. Another studied in Wu and Yue, served as a Secretary, and later returned to his country. In the Song and Yuan dynasties, Korean students continued to come to China to study. At the beginning of the 12th century, five Korean students came to Song China to study. After three years, when Quan Shi (权适) took the examination, his paper was excellent in both writing and meaning, and he was "given the position of first-class贡士." After returning to his country, he served as the Director of the Imperial Academy and continued to devote himself to education. During the Yuan Dynasty, there were more than ten Korean students who came to China to take the examination, such as Lee Saek (李穑), who studied at the Imperial Academy for three years, and his paper was praised by Ouyang Xuan (欧阳玄). After returning to his country, he became the Grand Master of the National Academy (成均馆) (president of the university). "Previously, there were only a few dozen students in the academy. Lee Saek reorganized the school system, sitting in the Minglun Hall every day, teaching scriptures. After the lectures, they discussed and debated tirelessly, and the scholars gathered together, observing and learning from each other." Koreans who stayed in China, such as the Quan family and Gao family in the Tang Dynasty, mostly served as guarding generals. The famous one was Gao Xianzhi (高仙芝), the Jiedushi of the Four Garrisons of Anxi, who was defeated by the Abbasids in Central Asia, and thus the Chinese papermaking technology was introduced to Western Europe through the Arabs. Heukchi Sangji (黑齿常之) from Baekje in southwestern Korea served as the envoy of the Heyuan Army and contributed to the Tang Dynasty's defense against the Tibetan Empire. During the Song Dynasty, Jin Xingcheng (金行成) served as the Assistant Administrator of Anzhou, and Kang Jian (康戬) knew the prefectures of Xia and Yue. During the Qing Dynasty, An Qi (安岐) became rich through business in China, and his collection of calligraphy and paintings is also very important in the modern history of collecting.

　　Buddhism was introduced to Korea through China in the 4th century. Since the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Korean monks have continued to come to China. There are about fifty high-ranking monks who went to Tang China to seek the Dharma. Wonhyo (元晓) and Uisang (义湘) were the main figures who introduced Buddhism from China in the early days, and all sects were established under the influence of Chinese Buddhism. Some Silla monks used China as a bridge, studied and then went to India to seek famous teachers and scriptures. Among them, Hyecho (慧超) traveled west for ten years and died in Wutai Mountain after returning to Tang China. He left behind his travelogue written in Chinese in Central Asia and India. Although it is incomplete, it is still an important document for us to study the history of Central Asia and India today, and it is also an important document in the history of friendly relations between China, Korea, and India! In 1085, Uicheon (义天) entered Song China, and the monks in Bianjing praised him as "a highly talented and knowledgeable scholar, worthy of being a teacher." In 983, China completed the carving of the Tripitaka board. The collection of more than 5,000 volumes of Chinese-translated Buddhist scriptures was more widely circulated in East Asian countries centered on China in the form of printed books. Eight years later, the printed Tripitaka was imported into Korea. Around 1020, Korea began to carve its own Tripitaka board based on the Northern Song edition, which was completed in 1087. The circulation and spread of Buddhism became even more widespread. Uicheon also spent more than twenty years collecting commentaries on Buddhist scriptures from both Song and Liao, totaling more than 4,000 volumes, which were carved and published. This is also a memorable event in the history of Chinese-Korean Buddhist relations!

　　Due to geographical relations, there were often Korean immigrants in the northeastern part of China. During the Yuan Dynasty, there were many Korean residents in Liaoyang, Shenyang, and other places, so the General Administration Office of Liaoyang and Shenyang and other places was established to manage the Korean soldiers and people. In 1369, Emperor Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty said in a letter to the King of Korea: "Recently, people from You and Yan have been moved south to seek food, including 165 Korean people." Fearing that they had "thoughts of their hometown and relatives," he sent Korean eunuchs to escort them back to their country. More than ten years later, Yi Seong-gye also said: "The northern border is connected to the territory of the Jurchen, Dada, Liaoshen... Now their residents often trade with those customs and even marry." This friendly relationship between the Chinese and Korean people has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. By the 1870s, due to frequent disasters, a large number of Korean farmers migrated to Hunchun, Wangqing, Yanji, Helong, and other counties. By the time of Japan's surrender, the total Korean population in the Northeast was more than one million. After the September 18th Incident, the Chinese and Korean people in various parts of the Northeast rose up to resist Japan. In January 1936, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established. Its main leaders were Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, Li Hongguang, Kim Il-sung, and other anti-Japanese heroes of the Chinese and Korean people. Almost half of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Armies were Korean comrades. During the entire War of Resistance Against Japan, tens of thousands of Korean people participated. During the three-year Liberation War, more than 50,000 Korean people participated in the People's Liberation Army. Countless heroes and models have emerged in various positions. After August 15th, hundreds of thousands of people returned to their homeland, and 1.2 million people remained, becoming members of the big family of Chinese ethnic groups. The Northeast fully implemented land reform, and the Korean people equally received land, livestock, and agricultural tools. The enthusiasm for production has been improved, agricultural technology has been improved, the harvest has increased, and the life has been greatly improved. In terms of politics, many people's congresses at all levels in the Northeast have representatives of the Korean ethnic group participating. In the Korean ethnic group's settlement area in Yanbian, there are 357 schools and one university. There is one university, four normal schools, more than 70 middle schools, and more than 1,500 primary schools for the Korean ethnic group in the entire Northeast. There are more than 200,000 students in colleges, middle schools, and primary schools. They use their own language and writing, and publish their own books, newspapers, and magazines. These Korean people work hard and happily, and jointly build a new People's Republic of China with other fraternal ethnic groups. A look back makes us deeply feel that they are ten thousand times happier than their ancestors, the Silla people who lived in China during the Tang Dynasty. As for the Chinese overseas Chinese in Korea, according to statistics in 1936, there were more than 63,000 people. We expect the Korean people to quickly drive away the US imperialism, wipe out the Lee Seung-man gang, and unify the country with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Then, engage in peaceful construction, so that the Chinese people in Korea can also contribute.

　　It is traditionally said that Gija introduced the well-field system to Korea, and it is said that there are well-field relics in Pyongyang, which is not correct. The so-called well-field relics are actually ancient city ruins. The economic relationship between the Chinese and Korean people is not in the so-called well-field, but in the mutually beneficial trade. In 958, the envoy of the Later Zhou Dynasty brought thousands of匹帛 to Korea to buy copper for coining money, and obtained 50,000 jin of copper from Korea. Xu Jing, who was an envoy to Korea at the beginning of the 12th century, recorded that the Korean people "are not good at sericulture, and their silk thread weaving all relies on merchants from Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang." He also said that Koreans like Chinese tea, which is also one of the goods sold by merchants. The large number of merchants from the Song Dynasty who traded in Korea and the frequency of their visits are enough to illustrate the economic mutual assistance between the Chinese and Korean people. Merchants from the Song Dynasty went to Korea in groups of at least dozens of people each time. Now, let's just look at groups of more than 100 people. For example, in 1038, 147 merchants from Mingzhou and Taizhou went together, in 1089 there were 127 merchants from Song, in 1090 there were 150 people, in 1148 there were 330 people, in 1149 there were 105 people, and in 1221 there were 115 people. In the years 1060, 1089, 1102, 1110, etc., three groups of Song merchants went to Korea to trade each year. In 1149, four groups of Song merchants went to Korea successively, with a total of 327 people. Huang Wenjing went twice, and Guo Man, Lin Ning, Lin Qing, and others went three times. During the Song Dynasty, there were hundreds of Chinese in the Korean capital Kaesong, mostly from Fujian, who went with the merchant ships.

　　The Ming Dynasty did not allow foreign countries to purchase weapons and military supplies, but made a special exception for Korea because of "休戚谊关." For example, although the mutual market of weapons was prohibited, in 1476, because Korea requested "ox horns needed for bow materials," the Ministry of War decided to allow the market of 50 bow horns each year. Later, because it was not enough, it doubled. Saltpeter was also a prohibited item, but in the years after 1592, in order to help the Korean people resist the Japanese pirates, the national treasury specially allocated silver to purchase saltpeter, sulfur, gunpowder, and "various military supplies" to supply Korea. In 1605, it was stipulated that when the envoys who congratulated the winter solstice came each year, they would purchase 3,000斛of saltpeter, which would be a permanent example. In 1609, because Korea's annual saltpeter was insufficient, it requested to purchase more in addition to the 3,000斛, depending on how much was needed. The Ming Dynasty also agreed, "From then on, regardless of the usual rules, if requested, it would be approved. The granting of trade in successive sections was not just once or twice." The preferential treatment was not changed until the end of the Ming Dynasty.

　　Korea has also given a lot of economic help to the Chinese people. For example, the Jianzhou Jurchen in the Northeast had early contact with Korea and obtained ironware, plows, cattle, etc. from Korea, which played a great role in the development of their society and economy. Before the Manchu Qing entered the Pass, in 1638, they agreed with Korea, "Because Ningguta is adjacent to Hoeryeong, it is appropriate to trade with each other." The following year, there was also a consultation to Korea saying: "If there are merchants from that country who are willing to come to trade, they can bring various goods to Shengjing (盛京) with all the merchants and let them trade fairly." At this time, the Manchu Qing naturally benefited more from the trade. After entering the Pass, the commercial exchanges between the Chinese and Korean people continued unabated, and the Wanshang (湾商) of Uiju (义州) (Uiju is also called Longwan, hence the name) were famous for trading with China. Records from the end of the 18th century say that Koreans were accustomed to using money at that time, instead of silver, so it all flowed into China through merchants, no less than 100,000 taels a year.

　　Korea has been growing hemp since ancient times. Xu Jing also said, "Their country grows ramie, and people mostly wear cloth. The best quality is called 绝 (?), which is as white as jade, but the width is narrow. The king and nobles all wear it." This unique ramie cloth is most popular among the Chinese people. In the mid-14th century, it was common for the Yuan Dynasty to send people to ask for ramie cloth, and records of Korea giving ramie cloth as gifts. From the memorials of Korea during the Qing Dynasty, it can be seen that no matter how many kinds of precious items Korea gave to China, there was always ramie cloth, and it was always listed as the first color. Although the order may be according to custom, the status of ramie cloth must have been different from other items when this example was first set. The fact that it was always there further illustrates its great need. In the 14th century, there was a Korean king who was fastidious about cleanliness. The history books say that he "spent more than ten pots of various incense for bathing in a month, and no less than sixty pieces of ramie cloth, called hand towels. They were mostly stolen by the eunuchs, and the king did not know." It can be seen that ramie cloth must have been soft and tough, so it was suitable for making bath towels. Until fifty or sixty years ago, the Chinese people still used "Korean cloth" to wash their faces. This is also an example of the economic connection between the Chinese and Korean people.

　　From the cultural exchanges, we can also fully see the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Let's start with the writing and language. The Korean language and Chinese were not originally from the same system, and ancient Korea did not have a writing system to express its own language. The Han Dynasty set up four commanderies in northern Korea, bringing Chinese characters with it. Later, the countries established by the Korean people more or less accepted Chinese culture and used Chinese characters as a tool for expression and record. The ancient tombs of Goguryeo were discovered in Jian County, Liaodong Province, and the brick inscriptions read "May the tomb of the Great King be as stable as a mountain and as solid as a mountain." The Stele of King Gwanggaeto, erected in 414, is also written in Chinese, describing the defeat of the military of Silla倭. But Chinese was not the Korean people's own language and writing after all, so in the mid-7th century, there was the so-called "Idu" (吏读). This is a tool for helping to read Chinese, using the sounds of Chinese characters to represent Korean particles, auxiliary verbs, etc., sandwiched in the middle of Chinese. It is said that "Idu" was made by Seol Chong (薛聪), but in fact, this was formed by many people using it continuously, and it cannot be attributed to any one person. "Idu" is the first important gift that Chinese culture brought to the Korean people, but it still had to be attached to Chinese and could not be used to freely and accurately express their own language, so there was the creation of "Hangul" (谚文). This is a phonetic alphabet jointly researched and created by King Sejong of the Yi Dynasty and Jeong Inji (郑麟趾), Seong Sammun (成三问), Shin Sukju (申叔舟), and others, which was promulgated in 1446 and has been used to this day. Since the 15th century, the Korean people began to write their own language with their own characters. Many Chinese philosophy, history, literature, Buddhism, Taoism, medicine, agriculture, and other books have "vernacular translations" or Hangul translations. The knowledge that was monopolized by the feudal ruling class in the past is now popularized to the masses through "Hangul"! The formulation of this alphabet is also closely related to Chinese culture. According to Korean records, Seong Sammun and Shin Sukju traveled to Liaodong thirteen times to meet Huang Zan (黄瓒), a Hanlin scholar who had been exiled to the area, to study and discuss the Hongwu Zhengyun (洪武正韵). Shin Sukju wrote books such as Vernacular Translations of the Hongwu Zhengyun, and his collection also includes poems to Huang Zan, expressing his admiration. In 1449, Ni Qian (倪谦) was an envoy to Korea, and his diary said that Shin Sukju came to see him every day after dinner, "with books on the table, discussing and correcting phonetic doubts." In a poem to Shin Sukju, he also mentioned "loving to ask about phonetic form and correcting rhyme books." From Shin Sukju's proficiency in Chinese phonology, one can imagine the influence of Chinese phonology and books such as the Hongwu Zhengyun when formulating "Hangul."

　　Although the Korean people created "Hangul," Chinese has a great traditional influence in Korea because of its long history. According to Tang Dynasty records, Korean scholars read books such as the Five Classics, various histories, and the Selections of Refined Literature, and Koreans especially liked Bai Juyi's poems and Zhang Zhuo's articles. Xu Jing of the Song Dynasty recorded what he saw in Korea: "In alleys and lanes, schools and academies are seen every two or three steps. The sons of the people who are not yet married live together and follow teachers to teach scriptures. After they have grown up a little, they choose friends of their own kind and study in temples and Taoist temples. Even soldiers and young children learn from village teachers. How prosperous!" Since Choi Chiwon, the writings of Korean literati, the official documents of the government, and the records of national history have all been written in Chinese. The envoys to China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, even if they did not speak the spoken language, could communicate with the Chinese in very elegant classical Chinese. The wording and spirit of the poems and prose written by many writers were all the same as Chinese works, and sometimes their skills and styles were above those of Chinese writers. Qian Qianyi of the Qing Dynasty compiled the Anthology of Poems from Neighboring Countries, and Zhu Yizun compiled the Comprehensive Collection of Ming Poems, which included many works by Koreans. Even Yi Sun-sin, a national hero who was not famous for his poetry and prose, can be taken as an example of Chinese-Korean cultural exchange in this regard. Here is a short poem he wrote while stationed on Hansan Island to resist the Japanese pirates: "The autumn light in the water country is dim, and the cold geese fly high in flocks. My worried heart tosses and turns at night, and the remnant moon shines on my bow and sword!"

　　Because of the use of a common language, the same scholarship could be studied. Baekje in southwestern Korea sent people to Emperor Wu of Liang to request Buddhist scriptures and doctors to teach the Three Rites and the Mao Poems. Lu Xu went because he had studied the Three Rites since he was young. Chinese books have always been the object of research by the Korean people, so they spared no effort to search for them. Tang Dynasty merchants forged Bai Juyi's poems to make money because they could be worth a lot of money. In 1091, the Song Dynasty sent people to copy books in Korea because Korea had many "good editions." At the beginning of the 12th century, the Linchuan Pavilion had tens of thousands of volumes of books. In 1314, people were sent to Jiangnan to buy back 18,000 volumes of books. In the same year, the Yuan Dynasty sent 17,000 volumes of books collected in the Song Dynasty's Secret Pavilion to the King of Korea. The Ming Dynasty people also recorded that Koreans loved books the most. Each time envoys came to Beijing, regardless of new or old books or novels, those that were lacking in the country, "they would go to the market every day, write down the book list, ask people everywhere, and buy them back at any cost." During the Qing Dynasty, the members of the Korean delegations often became acquainted with Chinese scholars and literati, exchanging books or their own works, making great contributions to cultural exchange. Hong Daeyong (洪大容) and Yan Cheng (严诚) of Qiantang established a deep friendship during a short gathering in Beijing, and their sincerity was touching. The Qing people praised the "Hong-Yan friendship" as a beautiful story. Ryu Deuk-gong (柳得恭) and Park Je-ga (朴齐家) met Ji Yun (纪盷), Ruan Yuan (阮元), Sun Xingyan (孙星衍), Chen Zhan

　　中朝人民之友谊关系与文化交流
    清华大学历史系教授　周一良
            一
    中国和朝鲜有一千多里的共同疆界，名符其实地唇齿相依。两千年来，无论在文化上、经济上或军事上，中华民族和朝鲜民族都是血肉相连息息相关的。虽然在中国的历史上，有些统治者为了满足他们的野心，曾经几次去侵略这一江之隔的邻邦，但中朝人民之间却始终保持着友谊关系，不受帝王们所发动的侵略战争的影响。近三十年来，为了民族解放，中朝两国人民在工人阶级的政党领导之下，更紧密地团结起来，向共同敌人帝国主义侵略者进行斗争。日本吞并朝鲜之后，许多朝鲜革命志士到中国境内来活动。以中国为根据地的许多次反抗，也都起了一定的作用。九一八以后，东北初期抗日游击战有不少朝鲜同志参加。一九三六年东北抗日联军成立，基干队伍的一二三路军的前身，都是中国和朝鲜的共产党人所领导的中朝人民联合组成的游击队。现在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首相金日成将军，是朝鲜人民抗日斗争的卓越的领袖。他所指挥的游击师曾经和中国人民的军队相配合，进行了好多次战役。许许多多朝鲜同志在我们的抗日战争和解放战争中，把血流在中国国土上。伟大的国际主义精神和崇高的爱国主义精神的统一，到处都表现出来。
    去年六月美帝在朝鲜发动侵略战争，周恩来总理便代表四亿七千五百万的中国人民首先警告美帝国主义侵略者说：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略，而置之不理！”十一月四日各民主党派发表联合宣言，更明确而有力地说出：“历史的事实早已告诉我们，朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危是密切关联的。唇亡则齿寒，户破则堂危。中国人民支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争不止是道义上的责任，而且和我国全体人民的切身利害密切地关联着，是为自卫的必要性所决定的。”全国人民广泛地热烈地要求用志愿的行动抗击美帝，支援朝鲜，组成了志愿军渡过鸭绿江。三十年来已经成为亲密战友的中朝人民，又一度并肩作战，很快地击溃美帝侵略军队，取得决定性的胜利。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军用他们的血写下了许多英勇壮烈的事迹，中朝人民血肉相连的友谊与团结光荣地充分地表现出来！这种友谊关系不是偶然的，是有它的历史背景的。我们回顾一下两千年来中朝人民的关系和文化的交流，可以帮助我们认识今天的形势，巩固这两个历史悠久休戚相关的民族的友谊。
            二
    远在有史以前，中国人民和朝鲜人民已经具有密切相关的文化。朝鲜有一种大石块叠起的石棚，西南部尤其多，跟中国辽东半岛山东半岛上所发现的形制相同。原始古坟的石棺也是朝鲜和东北所共有。朝鲜有始祖卵生的传说，而中国古代的商民族也说始祖是母亲吞玄鸟之卵而生。再从朝鲜人民的衣食住来考察，也可以看出和中华各民族的关联。从七世纪以来，朝鲜人不论男女都经常穿白色衣服，这风俗迄今不变。而在中国呢，古代东北的夫余族衣服尚白，女真族也俗好衣白，大约后来受汉族影响才改变。食的方面，朝鲜的主要食粮是米，其次是麦和小米，也跟中国差不多。朝鲜人家大都用土砖砌造坑床，冬天从下面的坑口生火。这个习惯可以追溯到七世纪，两唐书的高丽传中都曾提到。而女真族也有同样的办法。“穿土为床，煴火其下，而寝食起居其上”。当时称为坑（亦作炕）。直到今天，中国北方还沿袭着这个名称和它所代表的习俗。这些事实都说明，中朝人民在有意识地互相帮助之前，他们已经有一个良好的物质生活的基础，来建筑他们历久不渝的友谊。
    史记里记载，汉初燕国人卫满“亡命”，聚党千余人。赶掉朝鲜王箕准，自己称王。聚集燕齐亡命者，建都于王险城（今平壤）。传到他的孙子，招徕汉朝“亡人”越多。所谓“亡命”“亡人”，就是受不了封建统治者的剥削而逃走的人。所以朝鲜北部地方，很早就和中国被压迫的人民发生关系了。汉代乐浪郡（今平壤南大同江南岸）旧址曾经发现汉墓，墓里有许多殉葬的漆器木器金属器等。从漆器的铭文，知道是公元前一世纪到后一世纪四川的出品。中国劳动人民所创造的精致的工艺品，两千年前已经传播到朝鲜。扬雄记录方言，所据材料甚古，而“燕之东北朝鲜冽水之间”自成一区域。由方言之相同，可以想像秦汉时代燕之东北定有许多移民到朝鲜去了。
    居住在朝鲜的中国人们，在政治文化国防各方面都曾对朝鲜有所贡献。我们试举王氏高丽王朝时代（九一八年至一三九二年）为例。后周武胜军节度巡官双冀随封册使到朝鲜，因病留而不返。九五八年建议仿唐朝设立科举制度，试以诗赋颂与时务策，医、卜、地理、律、书、算等等也都列为考试科目。从此科举制度实行了好几百年。宋代温州人周伫、泉州人刘载、福州人胡宗旦等都是随商船到朝鲜，因而留居仕宦。开封人慎修有学识，精医术，官至守司徒左仆射参知政事。他的儿子安之曾任地方官，并且主持起草和中国南北两方面的外交文书。宋进士陈渭因有文艺，被任为秘书校书郎。萧鼎、萧迁，叶盛等三人通晓音律，把宋朝音乐介绍到朝鲜。田盛由于善书札，东养由于有武艺，也都被留在朝鲜，并且“加职秩以劝来者”。林完任国子司业，曾上疏请禁止权贵“挟权恃势，剥削诛求”。劝国王不要“劳民动众、百姓怨咨”。元人罗世任全罗道上元帅。日本侵略者乘船五十余艘来犯，步骑千余登幸安山，罗世率兵四面围攻，把侵略者打得大败。转判开城府事，日本侵略者数次攻江华，都被他击退。后来有一次日船五百艘入镇浦口，“登岸散入州郡，恣行焚掠，尸蔽山野。转谷于其舶，米弃地厚尺”。罗世用火炮进攻倭船，“烟焰涨天，贼守船者烧死殆尽”，于是溃败而逃。沈阳人边安烈也曾参加幸安山镇浦口两次战役。后协助李成桂大破倭人于南原。日人寇丹阳郡，安烈打败他们，斩八十余级。又败日人于安东，斩三十余级。这是十四世纪末叶的事，中国人民已经参加朝鲜人民保卫国家抗御外侮的斗争了。
    汉人之外，其他兄弟民族也曾在朝鲜形成聚落，与朝鲜人民和平相处。历史上可以考见的，朝鲜常有契丹人“来投”，契丹族聚居耕种的地方称为契丹场。一一一七年散居汉城一带的契丹投化人会合起来，奏契丹歌舞杂戏，欢迎朝鲜国王。契丹人尉貂列名于高丽史的孝友传。女真族也常“来投”，往往自成部落。如果“同类自相犯者，各依本俗法”。蒙古人也有留居朝鲜的。畏吾儿族的契氏十四世纪中叶迁入朝鲜。契长寿曾建议抵御日本侵略之计，以为过去清野之策不利于人民。他主张“计户数众寡筑城堡，以二三百家为率，设官守以居之。俾接屋连墙，仅容其众。除屋舍外，止留谷场。……凡城堑高深，上置楼橹，门置钓桥。其余守具随宜布置。城堑之间多掘品字小坑，树鹿角以遏往来。……禾熟则随刈随输，毋使稽缓。设有贼至，则少壮登城，老弱供食。”又分析倭寇情况说：“贼之往来恃潮水为期，非欲攻城略地，以谋久长。特以寇抄为心而已。既无所得，势必还退”。他的观察与建议都极正确，后来明朝东南沿海一带人民抵御日本往往即采取这种办法而制胜。可惜当时未受采纳。契氏世代相传，今天全罗道还有他们的后裔。从这些片段的资料，我们至少可以晓得，中国有许多民族在不同时期中都与朝鲜人民有过亲密的关系。
            三
    我们再看看到中国来的朝鲜人民。他们有的形成中国境内的少数民族，安居乐业。有些人在中国历史上留下了名字。有的又回到朝鲜，在文化交流上起了很大作用。总括一句话，这些来中国的朝鲜人民在不同的方面都促进了中朝的友谊关系。
    六六八年有二万八千户高丽人移居于江淮以南、山南、京西等地。九世纪中叶，今江苏江都、淮安、东海等县，山东牟平、海阳、文登、荣成等县沿海一带地方，多有朝鲜人聚居。当时新罗统一了朝鲜半岛，所以他们住的地方称为新罗坊，设有勾当新罗所和押衙，管理他们的事务。日本遣唐使回国时，常因自己的船舶不够坚牢，雇用新罗坊的新罗船只和水手。大约他们常往来于江苏沿海一带、山东半岛与朝鲜半岛之间。日本和尚圆仁来唐，在东海县遇见十几个新罗人，是从山东诸城载炭到淮安去的。他们引圆仁到新罗人家住宿。圆仁旅行时曾雇新罗人车，乘新罗人运炭船，受新罗“译语”的照顾。文登赤山有新罗人所建佛寺法华院，常住僧二十四人，尼三人。经常依照新罗风俗举行法会，用本国语讲经礼忏。圆仁曾去听正月十四、十五两天的讲经，每天都有二百多男女老少新罗人参加。从圆仁的日记中，可以看出这些朝鲜少数民族是和平而安乐地在中国生活着的。八一六年新罗饥荒，一百七十人渡海到浙东就食。这件事也告诉我们当时中朝两国海上交通的频繁，和中朝人民的友好关系。虽然海贼常掠夺新罗良口卖到中国为奴婢，但八二三年唐朝下令禁止，并且将已在中国者资送回去。
    八四○年左右，曾有新罗“质子”和学生一百五人留居长安。像当时日本的留学生一样，他们在吸收唐朝文化上尽了很大的力量。从九世纪到十世纪中叶约一百五十年间，朝鲜人在中国科举考试及第的约有九十人。有个崔致远，十二岁随商船来唐，十八岁举进士。回新罗之后，诗文和书法都发生很大影响。五代时如崔彦撝十八岁到中国游学，四十二岁才回国，作大学士，青年人都师事他。他的儿子一个游学入晋，转至契丹，以才见用。另一个游学吴越，曾任秘书郎，后还本国。宋元时代也不断有朝鲜学生到中国来读书。十二世纪初五个朝鲜学生入宋就学，三年以后策试时，权适试卷文意俱善，“依贡士第一人出身”。回国作国子祭酒，仍致力于教育事业。元代到中国应举可考者十余人，如李穑，在国子监就学三年，试卷为欧阳玄所激赏。回国作成均馆（大学校）的大司成（校长）。“先是馆生不过数十。穑更定学式，每日坐明伦堂，分经授业。讲毕相与论难忘倦，于是学者坌集，相与观感”。留在中国的朝鲜人如唐代泉氏一家高氏一家，大都作宿卫的将军。著名的如安西四镇节度使高仙芝，在中亚被大食打败，因而中国造纸术通过阿拉伯传入西欧。朝鲜西南的百济国人黑齿常之曾任河源军使，替唐朝防御吐蕃出了不少力。宋代如金行成作安州通判，康戬知峡越二州。清代安岐在中国经商致富，他的书画收藏在近代收藏史上也是很重要的。
    四世纪时佛教便通过中国传入朝鲜。南北朝以来不断有朝鲜僧人到中国来，入唐求法的高僧，史籍可考的就有五十人左右。元晓和义湘是早期从中国输入佛教的主要人物，各宗派也都是在中国佛教影响之下建立的。有些新罗僧人以中国为桥梁，学习之后再到印度访求名师和经论。其中如慧超，西行十年，回唐之后终老于五台山。并且遗留下他用中文所写在中亚和印度的旅行记。虽然已经残缺，依然是我们今天研究中亚印度历史的重要资料，也是中国朝鲜和印度这三个亚洲国家友谊关系史上一个重要文件！一○八五年义天入宋，汴京的僧人推为“高才硕学，堪为师范。”九八三年中国刻成大藏经板。五千余卷的汉译佛教经典的结集，便以印本姿态更广泛地流行于以中国为中心的东亚各国。八年之后，印本大藏经便输入朝鲜。到一○二○年间，朝鲜依据北宋刻本，起始自己雕制大藏经板，一○八七年完成。佛教的流通传播于是更加普遍。义天又花了二十多年功夫，从宋辽两方面搜集佛经的注疏，共得四千余卷，雕板刊行。也是中朝佛教关系史上值得记念的！
    因为地理上的关系，中国东北一带常有朝鲜移民。元时辽阳沈阳等地有不少朝鲜居民，所以设立沈阳等路安抚高丽军民总管府来管理。一三六九年明太祖给朝鲜国王的信说：“比移幽燕之民南来就食，内有高丽民百六十五人。”怕他们有“乡里骨肉之思”，于是派朝鲜宦者护送回国。十余年后，李成桂又说：“北界与女直、达达、辽沈之境相连，……今其居民每与彼俗互市，至结婚姻。”中朝人民这种友好关系数百年来不变。到十九世纪七十年代，由于频年灾荒，大批朝鲜农民移居珲春、汪清、延吉、和龙等县，到日本投降时，全东北的朝鲜人口有一百多万。九一八之后东北各地中朝人民纷纷起来武装抗日，一九三六年一月，在中国共产党领导下，成立东北抗日民主联军。它的主要领导者是杨靖宇、赵尚志、李红光、金日成等中朝人民的抗日英雄。第一二三路军中，几乎半数是朝鲜同志。在全部抗日战争中，先后有十数万朝鲜人民参加。三年的解放战争中，有五万以上朝鲜人民参加了人民解放军。在各种不同的岗位上，出现了无数的英雄模范。八一五以后有几十万人回了祖国，还剩下一百二十万人，成为中国各民族大家庭中的一员。东北全面实行土地改革，朝鲜人民同样地分得土地耕畜农具等。生产情绪提高，农业技术改进，收获量增加，生活大为改善。政治方面，东北各地各界人民代表会议很多有朝鲜民族代表参加。延边朝鲜民族聚居地区，有三百五十七所学校，并有大学一所。全东北共有朝鲜民族的大学校一所，师范学校四所，中学校七十余所，小学校一千五百余所。大中小学生二十余万人。他们通用自己的语言文字，出版自己的书报杂志。这些朝鲜人民刻苦地同时也快乐地工作，和其他兄弟民族共同建设新的中华人民共和国。我们试一回顾，不由得深感他们比他们的祖先唐代住在中国的新罗人要幸福万倍了。至于中国在朝鲜的侨民，据一九三六年统计，有六万三千多人。我们期望朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军帮助之下，很快地赶走美帝，肃清李承晚匪帮，统一全国。然后，从事和平建设，让在朝鲜的中国人民也能尽一份力量。
            四
    朝鲜自古相传箕子传入井田之制，传为平壤有井田遗迹，这是不正确的，所谓井田遗迹实在是古城遗址。中朝人民的经济关系，不在所谓井田，而在互通有无的贸易上。九五八年，后周使人带数千匹帛到朝鲜买铜，以备铸钱，由朝鲜得到铜五万斤。十二世纪初出使朝鲜的徐兢，记载朝鲜人民“不善蚕桑，其丝线织紝皆仰贾人自山东闽浙来。”又说朝鲜人喜欢中国茶，也是商人贩卖的货物之一。宋朝商人到朝鲜贸易的人数之众多和次数之频繁，都足以说明中朝人民经济方面之互助。宋朝商人每次至少是数十人同往朝鲜。现在单看百人以上的团体。如一○三八年有明州台州商一百四十七人一起去，一○八九年有宋商一百二十七人，一○九○年有一百五十人，一一四八年有三百三十人，一一四九年有一百零五人，一二二一年有一百十五人。一○六○年、一○八九年、一一○二年、一一一○年等年份每年都有三个宋朝商人集团先后到朝鲜去贸易。一一四九这一年内有四个宋商集团先后去朝鲜，加起来一共有三百二十七人。前后去过两次的有黄文景，去过三次的有郭满、林宁、林庆等人。宋时朝鲜首都开城有几百中国人，大都是福建人，跟商船去的。
    明朝不许外国来购买兵器和军用物资，但对朝鲜则因“谊关休戚”，特别例外。例如虽禁止外国互市兵器，但一四七六年因朝鲜提出要求“弓材所需牛角”，兵部便议定每年准市弓角五十。后来因为不够用，又增加一倍。焰硝也是禁品，然一五九二年以后的几年间，为要帮助朝鲜人民抵抗倭寇，国库特拨银两，购买硝黄火药以及“各样军火之物”，供给朝鲜。一六○五年规定，每年贺冬至的使臣来时，购买焰硝三千斛，永为常例。一六○九年朝鲜因为年例焰硝不敷用，要求在三千斛之外，视需要多少，另外收买。明朝也同意，“自后不拘常规，有请辄准。节续许贸，非止一再”。优待办法，直到明末不曾改易。
    朝鲜对于中国人民也曾给与不少经济上的帮助。例如东北的建州女真，很早已经和朝鲜接触，并从朝鲜贸易得到铁器耕牛等，在他们社会经济的发展上起了很大作用。满清未入关以前，一六三八年便和朝鲜约定，“因宁古塔与会宁接境，宜两相交易”。第二年又有咨文给朝鲜说：“彼国若有愿来贸易者，可会同众商人带各色货物明来盛京，听其两平贸易”。这时的贸易自然也是满清得益较多。入关以后，中朝人民间的商业往来继续不绝，义州的湾商（义州一称龙湾，故名）便是以跟中国通商而著名的。十八世纪末叶的记载，说当时朝鲜人习惯于用钱，而不用银子，于是都通过商人而流入中国，一年不下十万两。
    朝鲜自古便种麻，徐兢也说“其国自种苎麻，人多衣布。绝品者谓之绝（？），洁白如玉，而窘边幅。王与贵臣皆衣之”。这种特有的苎布最为中国人民所喜用。十四世纪中常见元朝派人求苎布，和朝鲜赠送苎布的记载。从现在所存有清一代朝鲜表文中看来，朝鲜给与中国的珍物无论多少种，每次都有苎布，而且总列为第一色。虽然次序可能是依照惯例，但在初定此例时，苎布的地位定与其他物品不同。每次都有，更说明它的需要之大。十四世纪时朝鲜有一个国王有洁癖，史书说他“一月汤浴之费诸香十余盆，苎布不下六十余匹，名曰手巾。多为内竖所窃，王不之知”。可见苎布定是柔软而有韧性，所以才宜于作洗澡手巾。直到五六十年前，中国人洗脸还用“高丽布”。这也是中国人民经济上与朝鲜联系的一个例子。
            五
    从文化的交流，也可以充分看出中朝人民深厚的友谊关系。先从文字语言说起。朝鲜的语言跟中国本不是一个系统，古代朝鲜没有文字来表达自己的语言。汉朝在朝鲜北部设置四郡，把中国文字也带了去。以后朝鲜人民所建立的国家或多或少地都接受了中国文化，也就利用汉字作表达记述的工具。辽东省辑安县发现高句丽古坟，砖文有“愿太王陵安如山固如岳”字样。四一四年所立广开土王碑也是汉文，叙述击败新罗倭军事。但汉文究竟不是朝鲜人民自己的语言和文字，于是七世纪中叶起始有所谓“吏读”。这是用汉字的音表示朝鲜语的助词助动词等，夹在汉文中间，来帮助读汉文的工具。相传“吏读”为薛聪所作，其实这是许多人陆续沿用而形成的，原不能归功于某一个人。“吏读”是中国文化带给朝鲜人民大众的第一个重要礼物，但它还得附属于汉文，不能够用它自由而确切地表达自己的语言，于是又有“谚文”的产生。这是李氏王朝的世宗和郑麟趾、成三问、申叔舟等人共同研究制成的拼音字母，一四四六年颁布，一直沿用到今天。从十五世纪以后，朝鲜人民起始用自己的文字书写自己的语言。许多汉文哲学、历史、文学、佛教、道教、医药、农学等书籍，都有了“谚解”即谚文译本。过去被封建统治阶级所垄断的知识，现在通过“谚文”而普及于人民大众了！这种字母的制定，也与中国文化有密切关系。据朝鲜记载，成三问、申叔舟为了制造“谚文”，曾经往来辽东十三次，去见谪居当地的翰林学士黄瓒，研究讨论洪武正韵。申叔舟著有洪武正韵译训等书，他的集子还有赠黄瓒的诗，表示景仰。一四四九年倪谦出使朝鲜，日记里说叔舟每日饭后来见他，“具书籍于案，讲校音韵疑义”。送叔舟诗里也提到“爱问形声校韵书”。从申叔舟对中国音韵学的素养，可以想见制定“谚文”时中国的音韵学以及洪武正韵等书的影响了。
    朝鲜人民虽然创制了“谚文”，但汉文在朝鲜因为年代久远，还是有很大的传统势力。据唐代的记载，朝鲜读书人所读的书即有五经诸史文选之类，白居易的诗和张鷟的文章都特别为朝鲜人所喜欢。宋代徐兢记他在朝鲜所看见的状况说：“闾阎陋巷间经馆书社三两相望。其民之子弟未婚者，则群居而从师授经。既稍长，则择友各以其类，讲习于寺观。下逮卒伍童稚，亦从乡先生学。呜呼盛哉！”自崔致远以来，朝鲜文人的著述，官府的公文，国史的记录无不用汉文。明清两代来中国的使人，尽管不通口语，都能用极典雅的文言和中国人笔谈。许多作家所写诗文遣词用字面貌精神无一不与中国作品相同，技巧风格有时在中国作家之上，清代钱谦益编列朝诗集，朱彛尊编明诗综，都收入不少朝鲜人的作品。就连并不以诗文著名的民族英雄李舜臣，都可以作中朝文化交流在这方面的例证。这里是他抵抗倭寇驻军闲山岛时所作一首小诗：“水国秋光暮，惊寒雁阵高。忧心辗转夜，残月照弓刀！”
    由于使用共同的文字，便能研究同样的学术。朝鲜西南部的百济曾派人到梁武帝处请求佛经和讲授三礼、毛诗的博士。陆诩因为少习三礼，应命去过。中国书籍自来是朝鲜人民研讨的对象，因此搜求不遗余力。唐代商人因为白居易的诗能值重金，不惜伪造图利。一○九一年宋朝以朝鲜藏书多“好本”，特来传写。十二世纪初临川阁藏书数万卷。一三一四年派人到江南购回书籍一万八百卷。这一年元朝又将宋朝秘阁所藏书一万七千卷送给朝鲜国王。明朝人记载也说朝鲜人最好书。每次使人们到北京来，无论新旧书籍或小说，凡国内所缺者，“日出市中，各写书目，逢人遍问，不惜重值购归。”清代朝鲜历次使节团中随员常和中国学者文人相结识，互赠书籍或自己的著作，在文化交流上有很大贡献。洪大容和钱唐人严诚在北京短短的聚会，建立了深厚的友谊，精诚相感，清人把“洪严之交”传为美谈。柳得恭朴齐家两人认识了纪盷、阮元、孙星衍、陈鱣、钱东垣、黄丕烈、罗聘等，讨论学术，赠答诗文。柳朴两人的著作被清人辗转抄录刊印。他们的相识或是由人介绍，或在琉璃厂书店里碰到。例如柳得恭和陈鱣便是在书店五柳居订交，于是连日在那里约会谈论。书店的主人们在媾通中朝文化上也很起了作用。又有的朝鲜人不待介绍，直接登门访问。李调元有一段极生动的叙述：“偶有剥啄声，启之则一秀士。丰神朗润，眉如长松，眼烂烂若严下电。戴笠子，衣道衣，不似中国人。问之则目瞪然，不解一语。因以笔代语，始知为朝鲜来中国。”金鲁敬两次奉使到北京，先后结交了吴嵩梁、刘喜海、邓传密、叶志诜等人。第一次他的长子金正喜同行，那时才二十四岁。正喜对中国文学历史等修养很深，会见了当时学术界前辈翁方纲、阮元，以及李鼎元、汪喜孙等，讨论商量，甚被推重。仅仅一个多月的勾留，给他们长远的友谊打下了基础。正喜回国以后始终和中国的学者们通信，翁阮两人的实事求是的学风深切地影响了他。使他致力于朝鲜古代的研究，在朝鲜金石考古学上留下了很好的成绩。
    朝鲜的美术也和中国有很深的关系。大体上朝鲜北部的高句丽受北魏影响最深，西南的百济则跟南朝来往最密，六世纪时从梁朝带回工匠和画师。这说明了百济时代的砖和南京所发现萧梁时的砖上的花纹图案何以那样相似，中国的劳动人民在一千四百年前已经和朝鲜人民携手了！七世纪新罗统一半岛以后，又接受了唐代的艺术，从庆州所存留的各种艺术品很明显地看得出来。朝鲜人的绘画，无论山水、人物、花草、翎毛，都能跟中国人的作品互争短长。朝鲜有不少风俗画家和肖像画家，这种写实的成分是中国绘画里所缺少的。高丽画工常随使人入宋，宋徽宗时朝鲜画家李宁到中国来，画本国礼成江图。徽宗称叹为妙手，让翰林待诏们跟他学画。对于书法的重视也是从古已然。八世纪以来有许多碑是集王羲之、李世民、颜真卿、柳公权的字而刻成的，说明朝鲜人对名家字迹的爱好。朴齐家给孙星衍写大字“问字堂”扁额，一时名士无不夸赞。中国音乐也曾介绍到朝鲜。十一世纪中请宋朝乐工去教授，好几年才回来。以后每次使臣到中国，都派人来跟中国乐工学习。舞乐的歌词、曲调以及演奏次第等等，无不与宋乐相同。我们在今天的朝鲜乐舞里，还似乎嗅到中国古代音乐的气息！
    在医学上，中朝两国的关系也是值得纪念的。唐代医书传入朝鲜。到十一世纪中叶，朝鲜因为“医业须要广习”，所以规定“庶人”只要不是“乐工杂类”，都可应医业考试，借以鼓励。偶遇宋朝医生随商船来朝鲜，常被留住下。一一○三年邀来宋朝医官四人训练医生。一一一八年又有太医局教授等五人来教习，过了两年回国，医学才慢慢普遍起来。以后中国的医书陆续不绝地输入，朝鲜人自己也编了不少医方。最著名的书是十七世纪初许浚的东医宝鉴和胎产集要，曾由中国人重新刊刻流传。明清两朝和日本的医学界都非常重视它。朝鲜人民接受中国文化之后，常常用自己的智慧再加以发扬，许浚的医书便是许多例证中之一。（未完）
