　　Reply to Readers: On the Editing Method of "Our Great Motherland"
    The publication of pictures under the title "Our Great Motherland" has attracted the attention of a broad readership. Many readers have written to us with encouragement, for which we are very grateful. Some readers have asked us why we adopted the current editing method, and we feel it is necessary to respond.
    Precisely because our motherland and people are extremely great, our motherland has a long history and culture from ancient times, our motherland has vast territories in all directions, and our people are engaged in great and complex revolutionary struggles and various construction labors, systematically presenting such rich and comprehensive content cannot be done all at once. Whether editing according to historical sequence, geographical divisions, or political, economic, military, and cultural classifications, we would encounter many difficulties that are temporarily insurmountable, creating many unreasonable deficiencies and inversions. Moreover, even if this editing method were possible now, it would not be suitable for a daily newspaper, because a daily newspaper is not a textbook and must be as closely aligned as possible with current events and seasons.
    Therefore, we currently cannot avoid adopting a mixed and complex editing method. This allows us to have different content every day and every month, making it more lively and vibrant; it also avoids many difficulties. According to readers' requests, when publishing a special collection in the future, we can also re-select and change the arrangement method. Of course, according to this approach, there are still many shortcomings in the current editing, and we hope to receive the enthusiastic help of the broad readership at any time to improve it.

### 关于“我们伟大的祖国”的编辑方法

　　关于“我们伟大的祖国”的编辑方法
    “我们伟大的祖国”图片的刊登，引起广大读者的注意。很多读者来信给我们以鼓励，我们十分感激。有的读者问我们为什么采取现在这样的编辑方法，我们觉得有必要加以答复。
    正因为我们的祖国和人民是极为伟大的，我们的祖国古往今来有悠久的历史和文化，我们的祖国东西南北有广阔的疆土，我国人民又正进行着伟大的复杂的革命斗争和各种建设劳动，所以要有系统地表现这样丰富的全部内容就不是一下子可以做成的事。无论按照历史的先后，或者按照地理的区划，或者按照政治、经济、军事、文化的分类来编辑，都会遇到许多暂时无法克服的困难，造成许多不合理的缺欠和颠倒。此外，这种编辑方法即令现在是可能的，对于日报来说，也有不适宜的地方，因为日报不是教科书，必须尽可能与当前的时事和季节相适应。
    因此，我们目前不能不采取混合的错综的编辑方法。这样每日每月都可以有不同的内容，比较生动活泼；又可以避免很多困难。按照读者的要求，将来刊行专集时，还可以重新选择，改变编排的方法。当然，按照这个方针，目前在编排上也仍然有很多缺点，希望随时得到广大读者的热心帮助，加以改进。
