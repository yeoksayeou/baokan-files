Xinhua News Agency Report: North China Holds Agricultural Technology Conference
　　Conducting a Technical Improvement Movement to Ensure the Completion of Increased Production Tasks
　　[Xinhua News Agency News] The Second North China Agricultural Technology Conference was held in Beijing from January 23rd to February 2nd. This year, on the basis of last year's promotion of agricultural technology, rural areas in North China will further launch a mass-based technical improvement campaign. Improving technology is the urgent demand of farmers in the old liberated areas of North China and is also a critical key to completing this year's grain and cotton production increase targets. The conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the North China Affairs Department. More than 220 attendees included representatives from the agricultural and forestry departments of the people's governments of North China's provinces, provincial and prefectural state farms, pest and disease control stations, and key counties; agricultural experts and technicians from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Beijing Agricultural College, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences; agricultural labor models who have achieved significant results in improving technology; and personnel from relevant departments of the Central People's Government. The conference summarized the achievements and experiences of promoting agricultural technology in North China last year and proposed the task of improving technology and the direction of the technical improvement movement this year.
　　The conference pointed out that the improvement of agricultural technology has gradually become a mass movement in North China. Last year, the promotion of agricultural technology in North China achieved great results in pest and disease control, the selection and promotion of superior varieties, improved cultivation techniques, and farm demonstration work. Under the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" in pest and disease control, farmers in North China have generally understood the benefits of winter plowing, have developed the habit of winter plowing, and can regularly carry out weeding, collecting grain roots, and collecting insect eggs. Last year, 8.37 million farmers in North China captured and killed pests, reducing losses by at least 500 million catties of grain. Warm water soaking of seeds, seed dressing with pesticides, and pesticide spraying have also been gradually promoted. A mass seed selection movement has been launched in many areas of North China. Last year, farmers in North China selected 60 million catties of superior grain seeds themselves. 60% of farm households in Hebei Province have carried out seed selection, and in key counties in the plains, 70% to 80% of farm households have selected seeds. Farmers pay great attention to selecting good disease-resistant seeds, such as the 82 good wheat seeds selected by farmers in the plains last year, 20 of which are resistant to yellow rust. Improved cultivation techniques were an important key to increased production in North China last year. Due to improved cotton planting techniques, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in Hebei Province last year was 32 catties, an increase of more than 5 catties compared to the previous year. In terms of technology promotion, the farms of provinces, prefectures, and counties in North China have generally been able to play their due demonstration and driving role, and the yield of cotton and grain in many farms has exceeded that of local farmers by a large margin. The cotton yield of Handan Farm in Hebei Province was 600 catties per mu, setting a national record. Last year, Shijiazhuang Farm helped farmers in Beidu Village improve their technology, increasing the village's grain production by 500,000 catties.
　　The conference believes that the level of agricultural production in North China has, in some cases, recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in some cases, has come close. Farmers are enthusiastically demanding further improvements in productivity, and their demand for improved technology is very urgent. Over the past year, farmers in North China have been very enthusiastic about studying their own production experience, creating many forms of competition, such as comparing technology, comparing pest control struggles, comparing seed selection, and comparing intensive cultivation, teaching and learning from each other, and making many technical creations. Agricultural science and technology suitable for the masses is universally welcomed by farmers, and seed soaking and dressing have been accepted by the majority of farmers. Using new agricultural tools and carrying out new methods of soil improvement have become new content of mutual aid for many advanced labor mutual aid groups. The conference called for further launching a mass-based technical improvement movement throughout North China this year, calling for "technology to go to the countryside," and requiring further integration of scientific technology and farmers' experience. Government leadership in production should pay attention to summarizing farmers' production experience, scientifically organizing and improving it, and then promoting it to farmers; should pay more attention to improving farmers' cultivation techniques, etc. In terms of pest and disease control, the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" should continue to be implemented, and weeding, egg collection, seed soaking and dressing, etc. should be promoted. Cotton fields should establish a field inspection system, and as soon as pests are found, manpower should be organized to quickly eliminate them, and the use of agents such as red arsenic, cotton oil emulsion, tobacco water, and "666" pesticides should be promoted. In terms of promoting good varieties, blind, long-distance, and large-scale seed transfer should be avoided. The mass seed selection movement should be further launched, and farmers should be encouraged to keep and exchange seeds themselves, and small farms and seed retention fields should be established to conduct small-scale variety trials and propagation.
　　To this end, the conference decided: First, all localities should plan to run technical training classes and compile and print a large number of popular agricultural science reading materials to generally improve the scientific and technological level of rural cadres. The ideological leadership of agricultural technical cadres should be strengthened so that they can establish the viewpoint of serving the people. Second, strengthen the leadership of farms and agricultural professional organizations at all levels. Third, plan to promote mass organizations such as farmers' technical committees, technical groups, and small farms in rural areas, and strengthen their technical leadership. Fourth, through organization, further launch farmers' high-yield competitions and comparison movements, and reward labor models.

　　华北举行农业技术会议
　  开展改良技术运动保证完成增产任务
    【新华社讯】华北区第二届农业技术会议，已于一月二十三日至二月二日在北京举行。今年，华北农村将在去年推广农业技术的基础上，进一步开展一个群众性的技术改良运动。提高技术是华北老区农民的迫切要求，也是完成今年粮棉增产任务的重要关键。这次会议是由中央人民政府农业部和华北事务部两部联合召开的，出席的二百二十余人，有华北各省人民政府农林厅、各省省农场和专署农场、各病虫害防治站、和重点县的代表，有华北农业科学研究所、北京农学院和中国科学院的农业专家和技术人员，有在改良技术方面获有显著成绩的农业劳动模范，以及中央人民政府各有关部门的人员。会议总结了去年华北推广农业技术的成绩和经验，提出了今年提高技术的任务和开展技术改良运动的方针。
    会议指出：改良农业技术在华北已经逐渐形成群众性的运动。去年，华北推广农业技术在防治病虫害、评选和推广优良品种、提高耕作技术和农场示范工作等方面，都有很大的成绩。防治病虫害在“防重于治”的方针下，华北农民已普遍了解冬耕的好处，养成了冬耕的习惯，并能经常进行除草、收拾谷根和采虫卵。去年华北农民捕打害虫的达八百三十七万人，至少减少了五亿斤粮食的损失。温汤浸种、药剂拌种、药剂杀虫也渐推广。群众性的选种运动在华北好些地区都展开了，去年华北农民自选的优良种粮达六千万斤。河北农户进行选种的已有百分之六十，平原重点县的农户，选种的达百分之七、八十。农民选种很注意选抗病的好种，如去年平原农民选出的八十二种好麦种，有二十种能抗黄锈病。耕作技术提高是华北去年增产的一个重要关键。由于提高了植棉技术，河北省的棉田去年每亩平均产皮棉三十二斤，较前年增产五斤以上。在推广技术上，华北各省、专署和县的农场，一般已能起应有的示范推动作用，许多农场的棉花、粮食产量都超过当地农民很多。河北邯郸农场的棉花每亩产六百斤，创全国最高纪录。石家庄农场去年帮助附近北杜村农民改进技术，使该村增产了五十万斤粮食。
    会议认为：华北农业生产水平有的已恢复到抗日战争以前的水平，有的已经接近。农民热烈要求进一步提高生产力，对改良技术的要求很迫切。一年来，华北农民对研究自己的生产经验很热心，创造了比技术、比灭虫斗争、比选种、比精耕细作等许多形式的评比运动，互教互学，技术上有许多创造。适合于群众的农业科学技术为农民普遍所欢迎，浸种拌种已为广大农民所接受。使用新式农具，进行新法改良土壤等，已成为许多先进的劳动互助组的互助新内容。会议号召今年在全华北进一步开展群众性的技术改良运动，号召“技术下乡”，要求进一步把科学技术和农民的经验结合起来。政府领导生产，应注意总结农民的生产经验，加以科学的整理和提高后再去向农民推广；应多注意提高农民的耕作技术等。在防治病虫害方面应继续贯彻“防重于治”的方针，提倡除草、采卵、浸种拌种等，棉田应建立田间检查制度，遇有虫害即组织人力迅速扑灭，并推广使用红砒、棉油乳剂、烟草水、“六六六”等药剂杀虫方法。在推广良种方面应避免盲目作远程的大量的种籽调剂，进一步开展群众选种运动，提倡农家自行留种换种，建立小农场和留种地进行小规模的品种试验和繁殖。
    为此，会议决定：一、各地应有计划地开办技术训练班，并大量编印通俗的农业科学读物，普遍提高农村干部的科学技术水平。并加强对农业技术干部的思想领导，使他们树立为人民服务的观点。二、加强对各级农场和农业专业机构的领导。三、有计划地推广农村中农民的技术委员会、技术小组、小农场等群众组织，并加强对它们的技术领导。四、通过组织起来，进一步开展农民的丰产竞赛和评比运动，并奖励劳动模范。
