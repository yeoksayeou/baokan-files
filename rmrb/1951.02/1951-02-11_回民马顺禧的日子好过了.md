    The Days of Hui Muslim Ma Shunxi are Getting Better
    To the Editor:
    In Caotan Township and Luocun Village, Third District, Kangle County, Gansu Province, there is a Hui Muslim named Ma Shunxi. He is sixty-one years old this year. During the period of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, he worked hard all year round, but he was always unable to get enough to eat or wear warm clothes. His eldest son was seized by the Chiang bandits and forced to become a soldier.
    After the liberation of Kangle, Ma Shunxi heard the People's Government talk about the policy of "getting rich through production and building a family through labor," and he was very happy. He got up early every morning to collect manure and worked in the fields during the day. Last winter, he earned 320,000 yuan from sideline occupations and bought a cow. He also burned a kiln of charcoal and bought more than three zhang of cloth and several jin of cotton. Now Ma Shunxi not only has a new cotton-padded coat, but also a new quilt. When people see Ma Shunxi, they all talk to each other about how the world has become better. Ma Shunxi always says, "This is the benefit that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have brought us."

    回民马顺禧的日子好过了编辑同志：
    甘肃省康乐县第三区草摊乡和落村，有一个回民马顺禧。他今年六十一岁了。在国民党反动统治时期，他终年劳动，但总是吃不饱饭，穿不暖，他的大儿子被蒋匪抓去当了兵。
    康乐解放以后，马顺禧听到了人民政府讲“生产致富，劳动发家”的政策，非常高兴。他每天一早起来拾粪，白天到地里作活。去年冬天，他搞副业赚下了三十二万元，买了一头牛。他又烧了一窑木炭，买回了三丈多布和几斤棉花。现在马顺禧不仅有了新棉袄，而且还有了新被子。人们见了马顺禧，都互相谈论着世道变好了。马顺禧总是这样说：“这是毛主席和共产党给我们带来的好处。”
