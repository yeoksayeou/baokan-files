            I. General Situation and Development of Credit
    Baijiazhuang in Wuxiang, Shanxi, is a relatively small administrative village in the Second District. The entire village includes three natural villages, 140 households, and 527 people (39 are elsewhere). In 1943, most of the houses in the village were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. In the past two years, with the development of production and the path to prosperity, the masses urgently demanded to improve production and build houses. The cooperative in the village gained the support of the masses because it accepted the supply and marketing policy earlier. It now has 489 members from the administrative village and 340 members from other villages, each with one share, each share being five liters of millet, with a total of 41 shi and 4 dou and 5 sheng of millet in shares.
    In the spring of 1950, after the village implemented the annual guidelines and tasks and the specific requirements of the spring plowing movement among the masses, it powerfully inspired the masses to improve production and strive for a prosperous life. How to improve production posed two difficulties for the broad masses: first, there were more than ten bad and old cattle that could not plow the land and needed to be replaced, and eleven households without cattle needed to buy them. To do a good job in spring plowing, it was impossible without increasing or replacing cattle. Second, with the increasing development of production, the masses urgently demanded the necessary construction of building houses and digging cave dwellings. When the masses were unable to satisfy these two pressing needs, more than 20 households proposed selling part of their land to exchange for cattle, buy cattle, and build houses, and 12 households had already sold 27 mu of land to build houses. In this situation, Wang Songliu, the manager of the cooperative, first proposed to the branch secretary to convene a branch general meeting to discuss the demands of the masses and the issue of selling land. At the meeting, everyone jointly recognized that it was right to replace old cattle, increase new cattle, and carry out necessary construction work; however, it was not good to sell a large amount of land to exchange for cattle and build houses. During the discussion, Wang Songliu, the manager of the cooperative, proposed to borrow 10 shi of millet from the Xingtang Credit Department to help the masses solve their current difficulties and prevent major changes in land ownership. This proposal was approved by the branch general meeting. After the meeting, Wang Songliu was responsible for borrowing back 10 shi of millet, which was then lent to five households, who replaced five old cattle, immediately gaining the support of the masses. This was the first step in the development of credit work in Baijiazhuang.
    On this basis, another branch general meeting was held to discuss the importance of credit work, clarifying that the masses would inevitably face some difficult problems in production and life, and that doing a good job in credit work could give the masses an opportunity to recuperate. Finally, the branch and the People's Representatives' Meeting successively made resolutions and, with the approval of higher authorities, established a credit department. After the decision, representatives, party members, and cooperative cadres widely publicized among the masses, introducing the benefits of Xingtang's credit department and the fact that the village had replaced five old cattle to help everyone change their burden. More than 30 households with surplus grain and slightly surplus grain gathered 40 shares (2 dou of millet per share), totaling 8 shi of millet (2% interest per month), and established a credit department (April 1950), which was immediately lent out (3% interest, with guarantors, fixed time, good credit, repayment after wheat harvest), helping six households buy three cattle, replace four cattle, and buy 40 pieces of agricultural tools. This was the second step in the development of credit business in Baijiazhuang.
    After the establishment of the credit department, the cooperative continued to publicize grain storage among the masses, focusing on explaining that grain storage households could benefit, the cooperative guaranteed repayment upon maturity, the fixed time was short, and turning dead surplus grain into active funds was conducive to the development of production. In May, it mobilized 17 households to store 36 shi and 4 dou of wheat, and expanded 150 shares (2 dou of wheat per share), totaling 30 shi of grain, and lent a total of 38 shi from the previous time to 27 households to replace two old cattle, buy five cattle, and also lent out part of the construction loan for building houses. This was the third step in the development of credit in Baijiazhuang.
    After the credit was carried out, the main problem was creditworthiness. When the grain storage matured, the cooperative prepared 15 shi of grain for the grain storage households to collect. But the grain storage households saw that the cooperative had prepared the grain and did not take it. None of the 36 shi and 4 dou was taken away. After the wheat harvest, all the more than 57 shi of grain lent out was returned to the credit department on time with principal and interest, except for one household. This greatly improved the credibility of credit and the confidence of cadres. This was the fourth step in the development of credit in Baijiazhuang.
    After 57 shi of grain were stored in the credit department, the cooperative worried that it would not be able to lend it out. After research by the cooperative and the branch, three ways were found: first, develop sheep herds and develop production; second, solve the difficulties in wheat planting; third, lend to the masses in nearby administrative villages to solve production difficulties. In August and September, the three plans were realized, lending 13 shi of millet to the masses to buy 30 sheep. Twenty shi of millet were lent to the masses in Xiaoxigou Administrative Village (two or three li away from Baijiazhuang) in the Third District to replace nine old cattle. Five shi of millet were lent to the masses in Huozhuang. The remaining grain was lent to the farmers in the village when plowing wheat fields, and three cattle, four donkeys, and a batch of fertilizers were bought. More than 50 shi of stored grain were all lent out again. This was the fifth step in the development of credit in Baijiazhuang. The above is the development process of credit work in Baijiazhuang from March to September.
    After the development of credit, the broad masses, from their personal experience, first realized that credit business turns dead grain into active funds, which is beneficial to both depositors and borrowers, and helps develop production and prosper the economy. Secondly, they realized that credit can help the masses solve difficulties in production, ensure the realization of production plans, ensure that most farmers do not go bankrupt, ensure less land change, and enable difficult households such as An Sanhai and Wang Sanxi in the village to buy cattle without selling land.
            II. Seven Months of Credit Work Experience
    From the credit work of Baijiazhuang in 1950, the following main experiences were explored:
    A. It is necessary to implement a series of ideological mobilization work, step by step to grasp the masses' personal requirements to mobilize and educate farmers, so that farmers understand credit work, which is beneficial to both depositors and borrowers, and establish credit work on the basis of mass consciousness.
    B. The cooperative must strictly abide by credit and ensure repayment upon maturity. When starting to mobilize grain storage, the time should be short, giving grain storage households practical experience and gradually improving credit credibility. The use of loans must start from solving production difficulties and developing production. Necessary procedures such as signing contracts, setting deadlines, and finding guarantors should be done to ensure repayment upon maturity and non-violation of credit, so that credit work can be consolidated through creditworthiness.
    C. Grain storage is free, grain withdrawal is on time, and the loan period is best based on the season. Grasping the season is beneficial to solving production difficulties, developing production, and ensuring creditworthiness. The situation of lending and repayment in seven months is: lending out in spring plowing and repaying in wheat harvest; lending out before autumn and repaying after autumn. In order to support winter production, it is planned to lend out in winter and recover before spring plowing.
    D. After the development of credit business, it is necessary to solve the problem of grain storage outflow, so as to avoid storing more and lending less, accumulating grain and losing interest.
    E. Villages and cooperatives that have developed credit business and credit departments should preferably contact the county cooperative and the bank. When there is grain that cannot be lent out, obtain the support of the county cooperative and the bank so that the county cooperative and the bank can use it for other production to ensure the continued development of credit business.

　　武乡白家庄合作社的信贷工作

            一、一般情况与信贷发展经过
    山西武乡白家庄是二区的一个较小的行政村。全村包括三个自然村，一百四十户，五百二十七口人（三十九人在外）。一九四三年，该村房屋曾大部被日寇破坏。近二年来，在发展生产走上富裕的情况下，群众迫切要求搞好生产，建设房屋。该村合作社因接受供销方针较早，颇得群众拥护。现已有本行政村社员四百八十九人，外村社员三百四十人，每人一股，每股小米五升，股金米共四十一石四斗五升。
    一九五○年春季，该村把全年的方针任务与春耕运动的具体要求在群众中贯彻后，有力地启发了群众提高生产走向生活富裕的要求。如何搞好生产，摆在广大群众面前的有两个困难：一是有十余头坏牛和老牛，不能耕地，需要更换，还有十一户无牛需要购买，要想把春耕工作做好，不增牛、不换牛是不行的。二是在生产日益发展的情况下，群众迫切要求盖房、打窰等必要的建设。群众在这两个迫切要求无法满足的情况下，有二十余户提出卖一部分地换牛、买牛、盖房，并已即有十二户卖地二十七亩修建房屋。在这样情况下，首先由合作社经理王松留向支书提出召开支部大会，讨论群众要求与卖地问题。在会上，大家共同认识到换老牛、增新牛与必要的建设工作，是应该的；但大量地卖地来换牛、盖房，则是不好的现象。讨论中，合作社经理王松留提议向型塘信贷部贷米十石，帮助群众解决当前的困难，使土地不要有大的变动。得到支部大会的同意。会后即由王松留负责贷回小米十石，随即贷给了五户群众，换掉了五头老牛，马上得到群众的拥护。这是白家庄信贷工作发展的第一步。
    在这一基础上又召开了支部大会，讨论了信贷工作的重要性，明白了群众在生产上、生活上，不可避免地要出现若干困难问题，搞好信贷工作，可使群众有个休养生息的机会。最后，支部与人民代表会先后作出决议并经上级批准成立信贷部。决定后，随即由代表、党员和合作社干部在群众中开展广泛宣传，介绍了型塘搞信贷部的好处，与本村换了五头老牛帮助大家换了肩等事实。有余粮和稍有余粮的三十余户，即集了四十股（一股二斗米）共八石米（一斗一月二合利），成立了信用部（一九五○年四月），马上放出去（三合利，有保人，有时间，讲信用，麦收后归还），又帮助了六户买牛三头、换牛四头，买农具四十件。这是白家庄信贷业务发展的第二步。
    信用部成立后，合作社继续在群众中宣传存粮，着重说明存粮户有利可得，合作社保证到期必还，订的时间短，把死余粮变成活资金，有利于发展生产。五月发动了十七户存麦三十六石四斗，又扩股一百五十股（二斗麦子一股），共粮三十石，连前三十八石，贷给二十七户换老牛两头，买牛五头，并放出建设房屋贷款一部。这是白家庄发展信贷的第三步。
    信贷开展后，主要的问题在于信用。存粮到期时，合作社准备了粮食十五石，等存粮户领取。但存粮户看到合作社准备了粮食就都不取了。三十六石四斗，一斗也没人取走。麦收后，放出的五十七石多粮食，除一户外，全部按期连本带利交还了信用部。这就大大提高了信贷威信，提高了干部信心。这是白家庄信贷发展的第四步。
    五十七石粮食，存在信用部后，合作社发生了怕放不出去的顾虑。在合作社与支部研究后，从三方面找出路：第一、发展羊群，发展生产。第二、解决种麦中的困难。第三、贷给附近行政村群众，解决生产困难。八、九月实现了三项计划，贷给群众十三石米，买了羊三十只。贷给三区小西沟行政村（离白家庄二、三里）群众二十石米，换老牛九头。贷给活庄群众五石米。下余在翻麦地时又贷给本村农民，买了三头牛、四头驴，还有肥料一批。五十余石存粮又全部贷出去了。这是白家庄信贷发展的第五步。以上即是白家庄三至九月信贷工作的发展过程。
    信贷发展后，广大群众从切身经验中，首先认识到信贷业务是把死粮变成了活资金，对存贷双方都有利，有助于发展生产，繁荣经济。其次认识到信贷可以帮助群众解决生产中的困难，保证生产计划的实现，保证大多数农民没破了产，保证土地变动少，使本村安三孩、王三西等困难户，买了牛，没有出卖地。
            二、七个月的信贷工作经验
    从白家庄一九五○年的信贷工作中，摸索出了以下的几个主要经验：
    甲、必须贯彻一连串的思想发动工作，一步一步地抓住群众切身要求去发动和教育农民，使农民认识信贷工作，对存贷双方均有利可得，把信贷工作建立在群众自觉的基础上。
    乙、合作社必须严守信用，作到到期必交、必还。开始发动存粮时，时间要短，给存粮户以实际体验，逐步提高信贷威信。对贷者用途必须从解决生产困难与发展生产出发。作到订合同、订期限、找保人等必要手续，保证到期必交，不违信用，使信贷工作从讲信用中去巩固。
    丙、存粮自由，取粮按期，贷粮期限最好根据季节。抓住季节对解决生产困难、发展生产、保证信用均有好处。七个月放还的情况是：春耕放出，麦收交还。秋前放出，秋后交还。为了扶助冬季生产，并计划冬季放出，春耕前收回。
    丁、信贷业务发展后，必须解决存粮出路问题，以免存多放少，积粮赔利。
    戊、发展了信贷业务与信贷部的村社，最好和县社、银行取得联系，在有粮放不出时，取得县社和银行的支持，以便由县社和银行用于其他生产，保证信贷业务的继续开展。
