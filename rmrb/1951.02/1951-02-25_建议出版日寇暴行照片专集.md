  Suggest Publishing a Photo Album of Japanese Imperialist Atrocities
To the Editor:
    The U.S. imperialists' crime of arming Japan has aroused boundless indignation among the people of the whole country. I was reminded of the fourteen years in the Northeast after the "September 18th" Incident. I personally experienced the disasters caused to the Chinese people by the Japanese invaders, and I saw with my own eyes the heinous crimes of these robbers. When I saw the photos of the Japanese invaders in China published in the January 31st issue of the "People's Pictorial," I felt indescribable anger at the atrocities of the Japanese invaders.
    The Chinese people will never forget these blood debts. Now that the United States is going to arm Japan again, the Chinese people are firmly opposed to it. I suggest that the relevant publishing agencies collect these photos, compile and print them into a special collection, so that every Chinese person can more deeply experience the preciousness of peace and freedom, and more strongly hate and strike at our mortal enemy—U.S. imperialism—to defend peace and defend the security of our great motherland.

  建议出版日寇暴行照片专集编辑同志：
    美帝武装日本的罪行，激起了全国人民无比的愤恨。我想起了“九一八”以后的东北十四年。我曾经亲自经历了日寇给中国人民造成的灾难，亲眼看见了强盗们的滔天罪行。我看到人民日报一月三十一日《人民画刊》所发表的日寇侵华照片，对日寇暴行，真有说不出的愤怒。
    这些血债，中国人民是永远不能忘记的。现在美国又要武装日本，中国人民是坚决反对的。我建议有关出版机关搜集这类照片，编选印制成专集，让每一个中国人民更深切地体验到和平与自由的可贵，更坚强地憎恨和打击我们的死敌——美帝国主义，保卫和平，保卫我们伟大的祖国的安全。
