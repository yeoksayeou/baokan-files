    The nationwide Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement currently unfolding is unprecedented in its scale in Chinese history. The following is a very incomplete report based on newspaper materials (mainly regarding gatherings and demonstrations by people from all walks of life):

    I. Workers: From December 9th of last year to February 11th of this year, workers independently held demonstrations and gatherings to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan in 44 cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou, Changxindian, Shenyang, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Qiqihar, Chengde, Dalian, Jinzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuhu, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Liuzhou, Changsha, Hengyang, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Xi'an, Dihua, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Ya'an, and Luzhou. The number of people participating in the gatherings and demonstrations totaled over 630,000. Workers in various regions also launched patriotic production campaigns. As of January 8th, according to incomplete statistics from the four regions of Northeast, North, East, and Central South China, over 1,200 industrial and mining enterprises, with over 1.2 million workers, had joined this movement. Due to the active efforts of workers in various regions, over 200 industrial and mining enterprises nationwide completed or exceeded their annual production plans ahead of schedule last year. In mid-January, with the famous Ma Hengchang group's challenge to workers nationwide, the patriotic production campaign gained new momentum. As of February 13th, 56 factories and mines and 1,380 production groups in various regions had responded to the challenge. In the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, large numbers of outstanding young workers across the country responded enthusiastically to the call of the motherland and actively signed up to apply for military cadre schools. In East China alone, over 20,000 young workers applied.

    II. Peasants: The peasants' patriotic movement is also developing. According to reported news, over 1,000 peasants in Jiayu County, Hubei, over 3,000 peasants in the suburbs of Wuhu City, southern Anhui, over 31,800 peasants in the suburbs of Wuhan City, and over 6,000 peasants in Shimahe Township, Chongqing, successively held patriotic gatherings or demonstrations in January and February. Peasants in the suburbs of Chongqing also formulated patriotic pacts. In addition, peasants in Wuhu in southern Anhui, and Songjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Wuxian, and Kunshan in southern Jiangsu also held Resist America, Aid Korea, and defend the homeland demonstrations in January this year after completing land reform. In the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, peasants across the country have taken actions such as launching production campaigns, ensuring the delivery of good public grain, and actively participating in militia to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea. Tens of thousands of peasants in the Northeast volunteered to sign up for war support work in Korea. In the early part of November last year, the peasants in counties at the foot of Changbai Mountain alone organized 4,200 stretcher teams.
