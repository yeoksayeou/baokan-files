　　The Japanese Communist Party Provisional Central Guidance Department Calls on Democratic Groups to Broadly Launch a Movement Demanding the Conclusion of an Overall Peace Treaty

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 31st] According to a broadcast from Moscow on the 20th: The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a message calling on all democratic political parties, labor unions, farmers' organizations, youth organizations, women's organizations, student organizations, and peace movement organizations to broadly launch a national movement demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty. The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party exposed the conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to prepare for the conclusion of a separate peace treaty in the message, saying: "Their intention to conclude a separate peace treaty is to turn Japan into a new war base and to make the Japanese people cannon fodder for this war."

　　The message pointed out that the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that Japan should conclude an overall peace treaty with all Allied countries, and then expressed support for the Soviet Union's response to the American memorandum on the Japanese peace treaty, and supported the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China. The message said: "The rapid conclusion of an overall peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupying forces are the heartfelt wishes of the Japanese people."

　　The message emphasized that a separate peace is a threat to peace in Asia. This is to completely turn Japan into a colony and hinder Japan's path to independence. We believe that now is the time for all Japanese people to rise up and defend freedom, independence, and peace.

　　The message finally appealed to all organizations and all patriots to launch a broad national movement for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty, and called on the Japanese people to rise up and fight for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty.

　　日共临时中央指导部号召各民主团体      
    广泛展开要求缔结全面和约运动
    【新华社三十一日讯】据莫斯科二十日广播：日本共产党临时中央指导部发表文告，号召各民主政党、工会、农民团体、青年团体、妇女团体、学生团体、以及和平运动组织，广泛地展开一个要求缔结全面和约的全民性运动。日共临时中央指导部在文告中揭露美、日反动派准备缔结单独和约的阴谋称：“他们要缔结单独和约是要把日本作为新的战争基地，要使日本人民作这个战争的炮灰”。
    文告于指出波茨坦协定规定日本应与一切同盟国家缔结全面和约之后，随即表示拥护苏联对美国关于对日和约的备忘录的答复，并拥护中华人民共和国周恩来外长的声明。文告说：“迅速缔结全面和约，撤退占领军，是日本人民衷心愿望的事。”
    文告强调指出：单独媾和是威胁亚洲和平的。这是使日本完全变成殖民地、阻碍日本走向独立的道路。我们认为现在是全体日本人民都必须起来捍卫自由、独立与和平的时候了。
    文告最后向所有的团体、所有的爱国人士呼吁，要为缔结全面和约展开广大的民族运动，并号召日本人民为缔结全面和约起来奋斗。
