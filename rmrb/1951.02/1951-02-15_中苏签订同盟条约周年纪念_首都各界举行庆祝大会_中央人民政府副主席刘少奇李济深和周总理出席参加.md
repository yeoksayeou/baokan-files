    The meeting began with the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech. He said: Today, we are here to warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the most magnificent treaty in human history—the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. We extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Marshal Stalin, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people. He then read the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Mao to Marshal Stalin, the congratulatory telegram from Marshal Stalin to Chairman Mao, and the congratulatory telegram from Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to Ginisov, Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
    Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Wu Xiuquan spoke at the meeting, saying: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance not only represents the lofty principles of the Leninist-Stalinist foreign policy but also opens up a new era of friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The alliance between the powerful Soviet Union and the powerful China is an eternally invincible alliance, a guarantee of world peace, and a guarantee of victory in the struggle against imperialist aggression. (Full text of the speech will be published in tomorrow's newspaper.)
    Next, Soviet Ambassador Roshchin spoke, saying: The main task of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is to prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression or any aggression and disruption of peace caused directly or indirectly by any country colluding with Japan in aggressive actions. Faced with the increasing aggression in the Far East and Japan being used as a base for the US aggression against Korea and China, the Sino-Soviet Treaty carries particularly important significance. The Soviet people and the Chinese people, united by friendship and alliance, can defeat any aspiring hegemonist. The friendship and alliance between the great Soviet people and the Chinese people is a strong force that can crush any aggressive conspiracy of warmongers. (Full text of the speech will be published in tomorrow's newspaper.)
    The meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of excitement and joy. Finally, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the Central Academy of Drama, the Youth Art Theatre, the Youth Women's Technical Troupe, and Soviet friends in Beijing jointly performed music, songs, dances, acrobatics, and other programs.
