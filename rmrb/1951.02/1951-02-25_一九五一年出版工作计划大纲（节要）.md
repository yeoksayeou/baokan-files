　　Outline of the 1951 Publishing Work Plan (Abridged)
    (Approved by the Central People's Government Publishing Administration's Office Meeting on January 5, 1951, and submitted for review and approval
    Amended and approved for implementation by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on February 14, 1951)
            I. General Principles
    1.  In 1951, the publishing work should first and foremost adhere to the "Instructions on Improving and Developing the National Publishing Undertaking" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and earnestly implement the five resolutions of the First National Publishing Conference. The main tasks are to continue implementing the specialization of publishing, distribution, and printing enterprises, adjust the relationship between public and private sectors, eliminate the disorganized and unplanned phenomena in the national publishing undertaking, strengthen organized leadership, and move towards gradual planning. In this process, 1951 should be a decisive year.
    2.  All publishing and distribution work should focus on expanding patriotic, internationalist, anti-imperialist, and anti-aggression propaganda and education as the central political task. Currently, particular emphasis should be placed on strengthening the propaganda against American aggression and for the defense of world peace, and combining it with the actual needs of national defense and economic construction.
    3.  In order to meet the urgent needs of cadre education and worker-peasant-soldier education, we should vigorously supply elementary and intermediate cultural and political textbooks and reading materials, massively supply popular reading materials for people's education centers, and widely launch reading campaigns.
    4.  This year, publishing, distribution, and printing enterprises should generally build upon the achievements already made in 1950, stabilize and consolidate them, and carry out planned and step-by-step reforms to enhance efficiency and save waste. In the Northwest, Southwest, and remote areas, focused development should be carried out to gradually reverse the trend of cultural and publishing undertakings being excessively concentrated in large coastal cities.
            II. Objectives of the Publishing Undertaking
    A. Publishing
    5.  Achieve a 50% increase in the number of new books published throughout the year compared to 1950, and a 100% increase in the number of copies printed. The overall target for the year is to publish 530 million copies of general books, textbooks, and periodicals.
    6.  Complete the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and print a large number of popular editions, hardcover editions, and separate editions.
    7.  Plan and publish Chinese historical geography works, Chinese modern scientific works, Chinese classical literary works, and literary works since the "May Fourth" Movement. Compile and print annotated editions of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun."
    8.  Publish translations of important works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and compile and publish various popular explanatory editions of Marxism-Leninism and books for political study.
    9.  Massively publish popular reading materials, current affairs handbooks, various pictorials, picture albums, comic books, and pictorial magazines that promote patriotism, internationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-aggression.
    10. Organize national translation talent and systematically translate world-renowned academic works.
    11. The People's Publishing House should gradually develop into a professional state-owned political publishing house, and work with local People's Publishing Houses to supply the largest portion of national political and current affairs reading materials.
    12. The People's Education Publishing House should begin revising primary and secondary school textbooks and establish a national unified supply system for primary and secondary school textbooks within this year.
    13. Consolidate and develop existing public publishing houses, especially the Workers' Publishing House and the Youth Publishing House. Establish public or joint public-private literary publishing houses and art publishing houses. Establish and develop local People's Publishing Houses with a focus, and begin preparing for the establishment of ethnic language publishing houses.
    B. Distribution
    14. Distribute the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" massively, universally, and systematically. The state publishing organs should consider providing price subsidies to some government cadres who are unable to afford them.
    15. Improve the distribution of primary and secondary school textbooks so that students across the country can universally and promptly obtain the textbooks they need.
    16. Achieve unified leadership and unified management of Xinhua Bookstores nationwide, making it the main distribution agency for public and private publishing books and periodicals nationwide. Combine it with the joint public-private China Book Distribution Company and national small and medium distribution organizations (and jointly with the postal system, cooperative system, etc.) to form a national book and periodical distribution network.
    17. Gradually establish various forms of distribution stations in rural areas, factories, troops, government agencies, and schools, especially in remote areas, to organize readers and promote reading campaigns. (Omitted below)
