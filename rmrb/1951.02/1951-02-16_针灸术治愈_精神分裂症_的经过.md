The Process of Acupuncture Curing "Schizophrenia"
　　Ma Jianxing

Yesterday, the People's Daily published my letter to the editors – Chinese acupuncture cured "schizophrenia." Many people have come to ask me: What are the details of Yang Xiurong's illness? I think that I am Yang Xiurong's classmate at Yenching University, and I was one of her caregivers when she was ill. Therefore, in order to provide information for the national medical community to study and promote Chinese acupuncture therapy, it is necessary to provide a more detailed introduction to her illness and recovery.

Yang Xiurong is twenty-five years old this year and from Sichuan. She entered Chengdu Yenching University in 1945 and came to Beijing with the school in 1946 after the war. In the summer of 1947, she discovered back pain and dizziness, but as the national student movement was welcoming the liberation war and gradually entering a climax, Yang was one of the active members of the Yenching student movement. Regardless of her illness, she insisted on working. In August, her condition worsened. After examination at Peking University Hospital, it was determined that she had spinal tuberculosis and needed to rest in a plaster bed. The recovery period was difficult to predict.

In January 1948, Chiang Kai-shek's gang extended its clutches to major universities and middle schools across the country. Many students were forced to flee, and the struggle became more acute. The battlefield was approaching the suburbs of the city. Yang Xiurong was originally recuperating at Lu Yongchun Hospital. She returned home. Without transportation, she stayed in Beijing. Without anyone to take care of her, she finally transferred to Shanghai. In April of the same year, she went to the Public Charity Hospital for examination. According to Dr. Tao Naihuang's report, the symptoms had improved greatly, but she still needed to lie down quietly for several months, and a new plaster bed was remade. In June in Shanghai, the weather was extremely hot. Because lying on the plaster bed was very uncomfortable, and coupled with a lack of medical knowledge, she was eager to get out of bed. So she started to sit up and move around in July. In early August, she went to the Public Charity Hospital for examination again. Dr. Tao advised her to lie down again. After examination at Zhongshan Hospital, the same opinion was given. She had to follow the doctor's advice and lie down again.

After this, she occasionally found insomnia, constipation, and wandering thoughts. During this period, the patient often tried to find things to do, such as knitting, reading newspapers, listening to music, and reading novels. But contact with the outside world, apart from through caregivers and occasional visits from one or two friends, could be said to be completely isolated.

In April 1949, she went to Renji Hospital in Shanghai for examination. Dr. Mao Wenxian was in charge and performed spinal fusion surgery. She received 300 cc of blood transfusions before and after the operation and was injected with penicillin. The surgery went well, and the patient was in good spirits. When discharged from the hospital, the doctor instructed that generally, after such an operation, patients could get out of bed after half a year and needed to wear a wire brace to be able to move around.

However, after being discharged from the hospital, insomnia, constipation, dizziness, silence, and wandering thoughts continued unconsciously and developed.

In August, I happened to return to Beijing. Shanghai experienced an unprecedented typhoon disaster. Transportation was cut off, and power was blocked. The patient was sleeping alone in a building and suffered a great mental shock.

In October, the patient was hospitalized again at Renji Hospital for examination, thinking that half a year had passed and the illness must have improved. But the result was that the spinal fusion site had not healed well, and the "blood sedimentation rate" was very high (50MM per hour), so she could not get out of bed. When discharged from the hospital, the doctor suggested that in order to improve the therapeutic effect, she should be injected with streptomycin for six weeks, twice a day.

The economic burden increased, and the feeling of loneliness also increased. The degree of mental confusion and constipation also increased (regularly taking laxatives, having a bowel movement once every three to four days). Streptomycin injections continued.

At the end of December, forty-two bottles of streptomycin were injected, and the wire brace was also made. But according to Dr. Ye of Renji Hospital, "you have to lie down for another two months and see."

A few days later, Dr. Mao Wenxian of Renji Hospital came to see her and told me that she could get up, but she had to continue to inject streptomycin for six weeks (still twice a day). By mid-January, the second streptomycin injection had been changed from twice a day to a concentrated injection once a day (the same amount). After 22 days of injections, the patient experienced a sudden change on the evening of January 9, 1950. The patient stared blankly into the distance, her pulse was 120 beats per minute, she had a slight fever (37.7 degrees Celsius), refused to eat, and did not answer questions. The next day, she was sent to Renji Hospital. After a series of examinations, a spinal fluid sample was taken, and X-rays of the lungs and spine were taken. All the facts showed that the patient's physiological condition was normal, the blood sedimentation rate was lower than before at 35 per hour, and the spinal fusion site was very strong. Finally, Renji Hospital specially invited Dr. Han Fen (Australian) for consultation. After her examination, she believed that it might be pseudocatatonic depression, possibly due to the influence of streptomycin injections (see the hospital's diagnostic medical record issued in 1950). Dr. Han Fen suggested that it is best to get the patient to move around more, contact her family, and get married at the appropriate time. If the situation is not good, "it is a very troublesome problem. Spinal problems promote schizophrenia. To treat schizophrenia, drastic treatment must be used (electrotherapy or insulin injection), and drastic exercise cannot be used for people with spinal problems."

A day or two after being discharged from the hospital, the patient's condition improved slightly. She sat up for half an hour every day, and then gradually increased the activity time and method. Sometimes she said a word or two, but she was indifferent to everything and very passive. Even eating and defecating required persuasion before she would move. At night, thinking she was asleep, I turned on the light and saw her staring wide-eyed. Sometimes she could sing a few songs, play chess. By March, she was able to go up and down stairs, and she even took a ferry to the suburbs for a tour once. But apart from eating, all actions continued to be passive. After contacting various places, I got the consent of Professor Liu Yude of Tongji University to examine the patient. He determined that it was "schizophrenia" and must be treated in the hospital. It is best to send her to the Red Cross Hospital and inject "insulin" for three and a half months, with a 50% chance of recovery. Later, I contacted expert Su Zonghua, and his judgment was the same as Liu's. He suggested not to go to the Red Cross Hospital, but the Puji Sanatorium in Minhang County was more suitable. After some negotiation, it was already mid-April, and the hospital allowed her to be admitted. When sending the patient to Minhang, she broke the silence of more than four months and refused to leave her original bedroom. After being sent there, she lived in a very large room with various mental patients. The iron door was locked outside, and we looked at each other through the window. She still recognized me and burst into tears. When asked again, she remained silent, as if in another world!

Five days later, I received a notice from Puji Sanatorium saying that Yang Xiurong refused to get out of bed and had refused all food and drink for three days. The hospital felt helpless, gave her two injections of cardiac stimulant, and sent her back. After picking her up, she was a little excited for the first two days, acted very quickly, was willing to eat, and play chess. After the third day, she suddenly burst into tears and said, "It's over! It's over!" Just then, a letter came from her family. When I read the letter to her, she became furious, tore up the family letter, and cried non-stop. After that, she lay in bed, closed her eyes, and refused to look, closed her mouth, and refused to eat. She ate once every two or three days, urinated every other day, and had an enema once a week. Gradually, even the enema was ineffective. Her abdomen was full of feces like pebbles, her limbs became thinner day by day, and her breath was dying. I consulted Dr. Su Zonghua again. His answer was roughly: there is no way to think, after a long time, due to insufficient nutrition, it will inevitably lead to pulmonary tuberculosis....

In such a situation, I sent her to Beijing. On the morning of July 20, we arrived at Qianmen Station. The next afternoon, I invited Dr. Wei Yulin to examine her, and then went to the Central People's Hospital to take X-rays. Dr. Zhong Huilan and Dr. Meng also consulted. The conclusion was: although the bone disease is good, she cannot take off the wire brace. As for injecting "insulin" or electrotherapy, the patient cannot afford it. This is completely consistent with the Western medical diagnosis in Shanghai. At this time, my father introduced me to Comrade Zhu Lian (currently the Deputy Director of the Department of Maternal and Child Health of the Central Ministry of Health). From July 24, Comrade Zhu Lian, together with her student Dr. Xu Shiqian, performed the initial diagnosis in the dormitory. At that time, she pricked a few needles, and after returning, the patient was able to drink water. Comrade Zhu Lian then certainly and kindly encouraged us to take care of the patient carefully and patiently. Massage the patient on time and help the patient exercise. After Comrade Zhu Lian looked at the patient's X-rays, she firmly advocated removing the wire brace and said that this disease can be restored to health after a certain period of recuperation.

We dare not completely believe Comrade Zhu Lian's words, but we have to believe them; she is so certain, so full of confidence, so conscientious, and so kind! After that, every three days, Comrade Xu Shiqian braved the summer heat and rode his bike to prick needles for the patient. Within a week, the patient's eating function was restored. In addition to three meals a day, she also ate some fruit, and urination was also normal. Glycerin still had to be injected for bowel movements, but there was no more fecal accumulation. A month later, the patient was able to open her eyes and see things (tears flowed as soon as she opened her eyes at first), and she could also chew food. At the same time, she could also stand up and walk, but she was very timid and afraid of strangers. Her heartbeat was very irregular, and she never opened her mouth to speak or express any opinions. If she was slightly dissatisfied, she would stiffen her whole body, like a wooden man, or her whole body would be soft. Two months later, her limbs gradually recovered, and her weight increased from about eighty pounds to about one hundred pounds.

Now, starting from the end of July last year, Yang Xiurong has undergone a full six months of acupuncture treatment. Just as the writer is writing this text, she is able to sing, write letters, write diaries, watch dramas, movies, play table tennis, play Chinese chess, Go, play cards, and almost speak normally!

　　针灸术治愈“精神分裂症”的经过
　　马健行
    昨天人民日报公布了我给编辑同志的信——中国针灸术治好了“精神分裂症”，很多人都来问我：杨秀容患病的经过详情怎样？我想，我是杨秀容在燕京大学的同学，在她患病时又是护理人之一，为了提供全国医学界对中国针灸医疗法的研究与推广，因此，将她患病与治愈的经过作一较详细的介绍是很必要的。
    杨秀容，今年二十五岁，四川人，一九四五年入成都燕京大学，一九四六年随校复员来北京。一九四七年夏季，发现腰痛头晕，但以全国学运正迎接着解放战争，渐入高潮，杨是燕京学运的积极分子之一，不顾病痛，坚持工作，八月，病况转剧，经北大医院检查，断定系脊椎骨结核，须睡石膏床休养，痊愈时期很难预定。
    一九四八年一月，蒋匪帮的魔掌伸向全国各大、中学，许多同学被迫逃亡，斗争尖锐起来，战场日益逼近城郊。杨秀容原在卢永春医院休养，回家，没有交通条件，留在北京，没有适当照顾的人，最后转移到上海。同年四月，到公济医院检查，据陶乃煌医师的报告说，症状大见好转，但仍须静卧数月，并重制石膏床一具。六月的上海，气候极为炎热，因躺在石膏床上很难受，加以缺乏医学知识，盼望离开病床之心太切，遂于七月间开始起坐行动，八月初，再到公济医院检查，陶医师劝令再躺，并经中山医院检查，也提出同样意见，只好遵照医生意见再躺下去。
    此后，即偶然发现失眠和大便不通，及思绪飘忽现象。在这时期，病者常自己努力找些事情做，如编织、阅报、听音乐、读小说，但同外界的接触除了通过护理人和偶尔一二朋友访谈之外，可以说是完全隔绝了。
    一九四九年四月，到上海仁济医院检查，经毛文贤大夫主治，施行脊椎固定术，手术前后各输血三百公撮，并注射盘尼西林，手术经过良好，病人精神很愉快。出院时医生嘱咐说：一般病人，经过这样手术后，半年才可以起床，并须穿一个钢丝夹背，即可行动。
    但出院后，失眠，大便不通，头晕，沉默，思想飘忽的情况仍不知不觉地继续着而且发展着。
    八月间我适返北京，上海经历了一场空前未有的大风灾，交通断绝，电源阻塞，病者一个人睡在一间楼房里，精神上受到很大刺戟。
    十月，病者再住到仁济医院检查，以为半年已经过去，病必好转，但结果脊椎固定处并未长好，“血沉”很大（每小时五十ＭＭ），不能起床。出院时大夫提出，为了增进疗养效果，应注射连霉素六个星期，每天两次。
    经济上的负担增加了，孤独的感觉也增加着，精神方面的恍惚和大便秘结的程度也增加着（经常服用泻药，三——四天一次大便）。连霉素继续注射着。
    十二月底，连霉素四十二瓶也注射完了，钢丝夹背也做好了，但根据仁济医院叶大夫的意见，“还要再躺两个月看看”。
    几天之后，仁济医院的毛文贤大夫来看她，并且告诉我说她可以起来，但须继续注射连霉素六星期（仍是每天两次）。到了一月中旬，第二次连霉素注射已由一天两次改为一次集中注射（注射量相同），这样注射了二十二天，病者在一九五○年一月九日晚上发生了突然变化。病者漠然凝视远方，脉搏每分钟一百二十次，略有发烧（摄氏三十七度七），不肯饮食，也不回答问题，第二天送到仁济医院，经过了一系列的检查，并抽验了脊髓液，照了肺部和脊椎骨的爱克斯光片子，一切事实都说明病者生理情况很正常，血沉也较前降低为每小时三十五，脊椎骨固定处也长得很牢固。最后仁济医院特约韩芬大夫（澳籍）会诊，她检查后认为可能是假性木僵性忧郁症，可能是由于注射连霉素的影响（见该院于一九五○年发出的诊断病历书）。韩芬大夫建议，最好使病者多活动，与她的家庭接触，在适当的时期结婚，如果情况不好，“是十分麻烦的问题，脊椎骨的毛病促成了精神分裂，要医治精神分裂；必须使用剧烈的医疗，（电疗或注射因苏林）而剧烈地运动，对于脊椎骨有毛病的人是无法使用的。”
    出院后一两天，病人情况略见好转，每天起坐半小时，然后渐渐增加活动时间和方式，有时也说一两句话，但对一切事物漠不关心，非常被动，连吃饭和大小便都要劝才肯动作，夜间以为她睡了，扭开电灯一看，她大瞪着眼睛，有时也能唱几句歌，下下棋，到了三月，已能上下楼梯，并且还有一次乘了轮渡，到郊区去游览，但除了吃饭之外，一切行动仍延续着被动情况。经过各处接洽，得到同济教授刘裕德的同意，给病者作了检查，他断定是“精神分裂症”，必须到医院治疗，最好送红十字会医院，注射“因苏林”三个半月，有百分之五十的希望。后来又向专家粟宗华接洽，他的判断和刘相同，并建议不要入红十字会医院，只有闵行县普慈疗养院比较适宜。经过一番交涉之后，已到四月中旬，该院允许收留。当送病者去闵行时，她竟打破了四个多月的沉寂，拒绝离开原来卧室。送去之后，和各种精神病患者一起住在一个极长大的房子里，室外锁着铁门，隔窗相望，她还认识我，并且潜然泪下，再行问话，仍是沉默不语，恍如隔世！
    五天之后，得普慈疗养院通知，说杨秀容拒绝起床，拒绝一切饮食已有三天，院方已感束手，打了两针强心剂，又送她回来。接出之后，第一、二两天，精神有些兴奋，行动很敏捷，也肯吃饭，下棋。第三天之后，忽然痛哭失声，并说：“完了！完了！”恰好这时她家有信来，读信给她听，她不胜愤激，撕毁家信，痛哭不止，此后竟卧床不起，闭目不视，闭口不食，每隔二、三日进饮食一次，隔日小便一次，大便一周灌肠一次，渐渐地连灌肠也无效，腹内积便如鹅卵累累，肢体日益消瘦，气息奄奄，再度向粟宗华医师询洽，他的回答大意是：无法可想，时日一久，因营养不足，势将引起肺痨……。
    在这样的情况下，我把她送到了北京。七月二十日的早晨到前门车站，第二天下午，即邀到魏玉麟大夫诊视，并到中央人民医院，拍照爱克斯光片，又由钟惠澜大夫、孟大夫会诊，结论是：骨病虽好，尚不能脱去钢丝夹背，至于注射“因苏林”或电疗，更非病者所能担负，这与上海西医诊断完全一致。我的父亲这时介绍我去看朱琏同志（现任中央卫生部妇幼局副局长）。从七月二十四日起，朱琏同志在宿舍里会同她的学生许式谦大夫施行初诊，当时扎了几针，回来之后，病者即能开口饮水。朱琏同志当时就肯定地、亲切地鼓励我们，要细心、耐心地好好护理病者。要按时替病者按摩，帮助病者运动。朱琏同志看了病者的爱克斯光片子后，坚决主张把那个钢丝夹背去掉，并且说这个病症，经过一定时期的调养，是可以恢复健康的。
    我们不敢完全相信朱琏同志的话，又不能不信；她是那样肯定，那样充满信心，那样认真负责，又是那样慈蔼亲切！此后，每隔三天，许式谦同志就冒着盛暑，骑了车子跑来替病者扎针，一个星期之内，就恢复了病者的饮食机能，每日三餐之外，还吃些水果，小便也正常了，大便还要注射甘油，但再无积便现象。一个月之后，病者已能张目视物（最初一睁眼就流泪），并能咀嚼食物，同时也能起立行走，但胆量极小，极怕生人，心脏跳动极不规律，而且绝不张口说话，也不表示任何意见，稍不如意，便全身僵直，像一个木人，或是全身绵软。两个月之后，肢体逐渐恢复，体重由原来八十几磅增加到一百磅左右。
    现在，从去年七月底算起，杨秀容已进行了整整半年的针灸治疗，就正当笔者写这文字的时候，她已能唱歌、写信、写日记、看话剧、电影、打乒乓球、下象棋、围棋、打扑克牌，并且几乎是能够正常地讲话了！
