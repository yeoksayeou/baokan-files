Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 20th: According to TASS, the leadership of the Italian-Soviet Association recently issued a notice stating that in order to widely publicize Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent, the Italian-Soviet Association will launch a campaign in March to promote the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. At that time, 105 lectures and discussions will be held in major Italian cities; many members of delegations from all walks of life who have returned from visits to the Soviet Union will report on their experiences in the Soviet Union, in order to illustrate the will of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union to defend peace. The notice calls on all Italian people to pay attention to Stalin's statement that if the war-mongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, then war may become inevitable, and emphasizes that systematically and widely exposing slanders against the Soviet Union and widely publicizing the Soviet Union's peaceful policies will be one of the main tasks of Italian democratic groups.
    
    Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Berlin, February 21st: Berlin's democratic newspapers continue to focus on Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent. An editorial in the Berliner Zeitung stated that Stalin, in his interview with a Pravda correspondent, "condemned British Prime Minister Attlee's hypocritical lies." The Tribune, the organ of the Free German Trade Union Federation, published the full text of Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent. The newspaper, in an editorial entitled "The People Can Maintain Peace," particularly pointed out: We Germans especially hail Stalin's words of peace. In an editorial commenting on Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent, the National-Zeitung quoted Stalin as saying: "If the peoples of all countries take the cause of maintaining peace into their own hands and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the war-mongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable." The newspaper continued: "Stalin's statement is very important for the German people. Stalin's words are related to every German. Everyone must repeatedly consider these words and act in accordance with these words." An editorial in the Neue Zeit also commented on Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent. The newspaper emphasized the point made by Stalin that "If the peoples of all countries take the cause of maintaining peace into their own hands and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    
    Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Warsaw, February 20th: Polish newspapers continue to comment on Comrade Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent.
    
    An editorial in Żołnierz Wolności (Soldier of Freedom) stated: Comrade Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent is of historical significance. Stalin's talk has made it clear to the broad masses who is guilty of making the current international situation tense, who has plunged the world into the abyss of war, and who has forced European countries to increase huge armaments, the price of which is currently poverty and political oppression, and in the future, the bloodshed of the people of these countries and their families being burned to ashes.
    
    Stalin's reply to Attlee's insistence that the Soviet Union had not demobilized its troops after the war fully exposed the lies of the bourgeoisie and European "socialist" politicians, who intend to use verbal peace to cover up the imperialist policies that the American government forces on them. Mr. Attlee's voice can be heard from the chorus of fabrications and deceptions, and his remarks once again prove that the Social Democrats are willing to become servants of American big capitalists.
    
    Żołnierz Wolności concludes: Stalin's talk is a huge contribution to the defense of peace and a devastating blow to the imperialists.

　　意苏协会号召全意人民
　  普遍宣传斯大林谈话
　  德波报纸继续赞扬斯大林谈话
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十日讯，意苏协会领导机关顷发表通告称：为了普遍宣传斯大林对《真理报》记者的谈话，意苏协会将于三月间展开宣传苏联和平政策的运动。届时，在意大利各大城市中，将举办一百零五次演讲会与讨论会；许多访苏归来的各界代表团人员将在会上报告他们在苏联的见闻，以便说明苏联各族人民保卫和平的意志。通告唤起全体意大利人民注意斯大林所说如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，那么战争就可能变得不可避免的一段话，并着重指出：有系统地广泛揭穿对苏联的诽谤，以及普遍宣传苏联的和平政策，将是意大利民主团体的主要任务之一。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十一日电：柏林的民主报纸继续集中注意于斯大林对真理报记者的谈话。柏林日报社论称，斯大林在与真理报记者的谈话中，“谴责了英国首相艾德礼虚伪的谎言”。自由德国工会联合会机关报论坛报刊载了斯大林对真理报记者谈话的全文。该报在以“人民能够保持和平”为题的社论中特别指出：我们德国人特别欢呼斯大林所讲的和平的话。国民日报在评论斯大林对真理报记者谈话的社论中引述斯大林的话如下：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。”该报继称：“斯大林的这个声明对于德国人民非常重要。斯大林的这些话和每一个德国人都有关系。每个人都必须对这些话反复考虑，并依照这些话去行动。”新时代报的社论也评论斯大林对真理报记者的谈话。该报强调指出斯大林所说的“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固”这一点。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙二十日电：波兰各报继续评论斯大林同志对真理报记者的谈话。
    华沙报社论称：斯大林同志对真理报记者的谈话是具有历史意义的。斯大林的谈话已经使广大群众清楚了谁犯有使现今国际局势紧张的罪过，是谁把世界投入了战争的深渊中，是谁迫使欧洲各国增加庞大的军备，这种军备的代价，在目前是贫困和政治压迫，在将来是这些国家人民的流血和他们的家庭被烧成灰烬。
    斯大林对艾德礼硬说苏联在战后并未将苏联军队复员一事的答复，充分揭穿了资产阶级和欧洲“社会主义”政客们的谎言，他们打算用口头上的和平去掩饰美国政府强迫加于他们的帝国主义政策。从捏造和欺骗的合唱队中可以听到艾德礼先生的声音，他用他的言论再度证明了社会民主党是甘愿变成美国大资本家的仆从的。
    华沙报结语称：斯大林的谈话对保卫和平是一个巨大的贡献，对帝国主义者是一个毁灭性的打击。
