Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, in order to oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, have sent a letter to Japanese youth, the full text of which is as follows:

Japanese young friends:

Recently, U.S. imperialism has suffered a shameful defeat in its war of aggression against Korea, and is therefore stepping up its efforts to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and further arm Japan, attempting to use the remnants of Japanese fascists and war criminals to revive Japanese militarism as a tool for its new war of aggression in Asia, driving Japanese youth and people to serve as cannon fodder for its aggression, and leading Japan to destruction. This sinister plot of U.S. imperialism has aroused serious attention and great anger among the Chinese people. The Chinese people, after enormous sacrifices, finally defeated the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples—Japanese imperialism—and therefore absolutely cannot allow U.S. imperialism to rearm Japan and let it invade China again. We believe that the Japanese youth and people, who have suffered serious disasters brought about by the Japanese imperialist war of aggression, and who have subsequently suffered unreasonable oppression by the U.S. imperialist occupation forces, are absolutely unwilling to be arbitrarily driven by U.S. aggressors, and cannot bear to see Japan once again embark on the destructive path of militarism, but are willing to live in peace with Chinese youth and the Chinese people, unite, and jointly defend lasting peace in Asia and the world. The Japanese Youth Fatherland Front organizations, the Tokyo Youth Organizations Federation, the Socialist Party's youth department, the YMCA, faculty and students of Shinshu University, and other youth democratic organizations, as well as workers of Tsurumi Shipbuilding Company, have all used signatures and other methods to protest against the United States arming Japan and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. This just action is being supported by the people and youth in various parts of Japan. We Chinese youth are willing to work with you to defeat this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and strive for a comprehensive peace treaty and a non-militaristic, democratic Japan. We firmly believe that in the face of the strength of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism will continue to suffer defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 1st: Local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing have issued a joint statement opposing the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan. The statement said: The U.S. imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan not only violates previous international treaties, violates its international obligations, and ignores the great achievements of the Soviet and Chinese peoples in defeating Japanese imperialism, but this activity is also part of the U.S. imperialist plot to launch a world war. We must unite with the people of the world, especially the Japanese people, to launch a movement against the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan and the arming of Japan, and strive for the conclusion of a just and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

The preparatory committee of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also called on more than 200,000 workers in the city to launch a movement against the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan. The call stated: During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the suffering and sacrifices of the Chinese people were extremely heavy. Therefore, the signing of a peace treaty with Japan cannot be without the participation of the Chinese people. We will continue to carry out the patriotic production movement and accelerate the construction of a strong economy and national defense in order to smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression!

    坚决反对美国重新武装日本

    【新华社三十一日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会及中华全国民主青年联合总会为反对美帝国主义对日片面媾和及重新武装日本的阴谋，特致书日本青年，全文如下：日本的青年朋友们：
    最近美帝国主义在亲自出兵侵略朝鲜的战争中，遭到极可耻的失败，因而加紧片面对日和约和进一步武装日本，企图利用日本法西斯残余和战争罪犯，复活日本的军国主义，作为他在亚洲的新侵略战争的工具，驱使日本青年与人民充当其侵略炮灰，将日本引向毁灭。美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋，已引起中国人民严重的注意和极大的愤怒。中国人民经过巨大牺牲才把中日两国人民的共同敌人——日本帝国主义打倒，因之绝不能容许美帝国主义重新武装日本，让它再来侵略中国。我们相信：曾经遭受到日本帝国主义侵略战争所带来的严重灾难，以后又遭受到美帝国主义占领军无理压迫的日本青年和日本人民，绝不愿意为美国侵略者所任意驱使，也决不忍见到日本重新踏上军国主义的毁灭的道路，而会愿意与中国青年和中国人民和平相处，团结起来，共同保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平。日本青年祖国阵线各团体、东京青年团体联合会、社会党的青年部及基督教青年会、信川大学师生以及其他青年民主团体，鹤见造船公司工人，都已用签名和其他方法，抗议美国武装日本，要求缔结全面和约。这一正义行动正在得到日本各地人民和青年的支持。我们中国青年愿意和你们一道为击败美帝国主义这一阴谋，争取全面的和约和非军国主义的民主的日本而奋斗。我们深信，在全世界人民力量的面前，美帝国主义必将继续遭受到失败。

                                  一九五一年一月三十一日
    【新华社重庆一日电】重庆各民主党派地方组织发表联合声明，反对美国单独对日媾和。声明称：美帝对日单独媾和的阴谋，不仅违背历次的国际条约，违背了它所应负担的国际义务，漠视苏联和中国人民击败日本帝国主义的伟大功绩，而且这一活动是美帝国主义企图发动世界战争阴谋的一部分。我们必须联合全世界人民，尤其是日本人民，展开反对美国单独对日媾和与武装日本的运动，争取缔结公正的全面的对日和约。
    重庆市总工会筹委会亦为此号召全市二十余万工人展开反对美国对日单独媾和的运动。号召书称：八年抗日战争，中国人民所受到的苦难，所付出的代价，异常惨重，因此对日和约的签订，就决不能没有中国人民参加。我们将继续开展爱国主义生产运动，加速进行强大的经济与国防建设，以粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋！
