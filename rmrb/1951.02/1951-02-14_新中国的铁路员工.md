　　Railway Employees of New China
    To the Editor:
    I encountered something unforgettable on the people's railway. On January 31st, I took the 京汉 (Jinghan) Railway No. 107 passenger train from Beijing south, and arrived at Matou Station at 6:00 PM on the second day. Because I got off the train to drink water and lost track of time, I missed the train. I felt extremely discouraged at that moment. I had a luggage bag and a cloth umbrella left on the train, and thought it would be difficult to find them. But after I reported the situation to Comrade Qin Ruiguo, the stationmaster of Matou Station, Comrade Qin immediately called Guanglu Station ahead. Stationmaster Lu of Guanglu Station found my luggage bag, but the cloth umbrella was not found. Stationmaster Lu then called Stationmaster Wang of Cixian Station ahead, asking him to look for the cloth umbrella, and as a result, the cloth umbrella was also found. After finding these items of luggage, I was deeply moved by the spirit of serving the people demonstrated by the working comrades of these three stations. Only on the railway managed by the people themselves under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can there be such enthusiastic railway employees serving the passengers. I want to learn from them, and I want to let the broad masses of the people know about this meaningful event through your newspaper.

　　新中国的铁路员工
    编辑同志：
    我在人民的铁路上遇到一件使我永远难忘的事。一月三十一日我自北京乘京汉路一○七次客车南返，第二日下午六时抵达马头站。我因下车喝水误时，掉了车。一时感到无限的沮丧。我有一个行李包及一把布伞留在车上，心想这些东西恐难找回来。但当我把情形向马头站站长秦瑞国同志反映后，秦同志立刻即给我打电话到前面的光禄站。光禄站鲁站长把我的行李包找到，但布伞没有找到。鲁站长又打电话给前面的磁县站王站长，请他找布伞，结果布伞也找到了。找到了这些行李后，我深深地被这三个站的工作同志为人民服务的精神所感动。这只有在中国共产党领导下人民自己管理的铁路，才能够有这样热诚为旅客服务的铁路员工。我要向他们学习，我要把这件有意义的事，通过贵报让广大的人民群众都知道。
