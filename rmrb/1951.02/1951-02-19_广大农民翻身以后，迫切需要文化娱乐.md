    After Emancipation, the Broad Masses of Peasants Urgently Need Cultural Entertainment
    Editor:
    There are very few cultural troupes in the Bohai region of Shandong Province. The peasants, who have been economically emancipated, have a very urgent need for cultural entertainment, but this need is not being met. Some counties have not had a single play in over a year, and peasants travel one or two hundred li to see a performance when they hear of one, which is a great waste of manpower. Cultural and entertainment activities are powerful propaganda weapons, especially in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and the land reform movement. It is very important to use artistic forms to conduct propaganda on current events and policies among the broad masses of peasants in rural areas. Therefore, I suggest that relevant agencies in various localities should widely establish people's cultural troupes, as far as conditions permit, and popularize cultural and recreational activities in rural areas.

### 广大农民翻身以后，迫切需要文化娱乐

    广大农民翻身以后，迫切需要文化娱乐编辑同志：
    山东省渤海地区文工团很少。在经济上翻了身的农民，对于文化娱乐的要求是十分迫切的，但是这种要求却得不到满足。有的县一年多没演过一次剧，农民们听到那里演戏就赶一、二百里去看，这对于人力是很大的浪费。文化娱乐活动是有力的宣传武器，特别是在抗美援朝运动和土地改革运动中，通过文艺形式，深入到广大农村群众中去宣传时事和政策，是很重要的。因此，我建议：各地有关机关在可能条件下，应广泛建立人民文工团，把文娱活动普及到农村中去。
