    Handan Town Organizes Private Merchants to Purchase Local Products
    Handan Town has historically been a distribution center for mountain goods and local products. According to a survey conducted last autumn, the total value of mountain goods and medicinal materials produced annually in fourteen counties, including Wu'an and Shexian, and flowing into the town reached approximately 110 billion yuan. State-owned companies and cooperatives can only purchase about one-third of the total production each year, leaving goods worth about 70 billion yuan that need to be purchased by private merchants. In the past six months, the town has earnestly organized and promoted this work. For example, through symposiums, the government has assisted private merchants in carefully planning purchasing methods, and the People's Bank has provided key support for private mountain goods stores with loans. As a result, the industry has seen significant development in the past six months, increasing from ten mountain goods stores with a total capital of 300 million yuan to eighteen stores with a total capital of 600 million yuan. It is estimated that this will increase to 1 billion yuan by the Spring Festival. Incomplete statistics for December and January alone show that the industry operated 807,000 jin of mountain goods, 126,500 jin of medicinal materials, and 46,400 jin of local products, with a total value of nearly 5 billion yuan. They adopted some of the following methods in the purchasing process:
    (1) In addition to purchasing with cash, they established methods such as purchasing on credit and bartering (this method can play a certain role in material exchange, but good credit should be guaranteed. - Editor), to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. Some private mountain goods stores went to mountainous areas through existing relationships to purchase mountain goods and local products on credit or through barter, converting the price according to the local price at the time, and registering the names of the goods needed by the masses (such as cloth, salt, etc.). The two parties agreed and set a delivery deadline. For example, Tongyi Store has established this relationship with 200 villages in Lin County, purchasing 20,000 jin of peach kernels on credit in the past six months, and buying back 140,000 jin of edible salt, nearly 40 barrels of kerosene, as well as iron pots, cloth, and various daily necessities for the masses; another method is to purchase mountain goods from farmers on credit or through barter, and then implement a guaranteed principal and real price method. This method is most popular with the masses, but private merchants are afraid of price changes and dare not adopt it on a large scale. This trading relationship is extremely beneficial to both private merchants and farmers, but it is currently limited to old relationships such as relatives and friends, and should be expanded into contractual business in the future.
    (2) Develop trust business. Establishing trade relations with out-of-town merchants through letters can directly remit money to entrust the other party to guarantee the purchase of goods and help promote the sale of goods. For example, a private merchant in Hankou purchased goods worth more than 30 million yuan through Tongyi Store in this town by letter. This not only saves expenses but also accelerates capital turnover.
    (3) In addition to organizing general joint sales and joint operations, they also organize joint operations with foreign merchants and small vendors in mountainous areas. The specific division of labor is that merchants in the production area are responsible for purchasing, Handan merchants are responsible for transportation, and foreign merchants are responsible for promotion. For example, Tongtai, Tongyi and other stores, jointly invested with merchants from Hankou, Lin County, Licheng and other places to operate jointly, with clear division of labor in procurement, promotion and transportation.
    (4) Write letters to introduce business conditions, so that foreign merchants can bring funds to cooperate in the acquisition. For example, Tongyi Mountain Goods Store sends an average of more than 50 business information letters to foreign countries every month, and has attracted many merchants from Tianjin, Shanghai, Shijiazhuang, Hankou and other places. This method has enabled a business in Shijiazhuang to purchase 400,000 jin of Chinese prickly ash here.
    (5) Absorb farmers in mountainous areas to invest in kind (mountain goods, local products). With this item alone, each store increased its capital by more than 100 million yuan; in addition, persuade shareholders not to distribute dividends for the time being (dividends can be used as new shares) to accumulate capital.

　　邯郸镇组织私商收购土产
    邯郸镇素为山货土产集散中心，据去秋调查，武安、涉县等十四县年产山货药材流入本镇总值约达一千一百亿元。而国营公司，合作社每年仅能收购总产量的三分之一，尚余货值七百余亿左右，需组织私商收购，半年来该镇曾认真地组织、推动了这一工作。如通过座谈会方式，政府协助私商，周密策划收购办法，人民银行并用贷款对私营山货栈作了重点扶持，故在半年来，该业已有显著发展，由十家山货行共资金三亿元，增为十八家共资金六亿元，至春节时，估计可增至十亿元。仅据十二月、一月两个月不完全统计，该业经营山货八十万七千斤，药材一十二万六千五百斤，土产四万六千四百斤，货品总额近五十亿元。在收购中他们采用了下述的一些办法：
    （一）除以现款收购外，建立了赊购、换购等办法（这种方法在物资交流中是能起到一定作用的，但应保证良好的信用。——编者），以克服资金不足的困难。私营山货栈有的通过旧有关系赴山地赊购换购山货土产，按当地当时价格折款，同时登记群众所需要货物的品名（如布、盐等货），两方协议，订出交货期限。如通益栈与林县二百个村庄均建立了此种关系，半年来赊购桃仁达二万斤，而代群众买回食盐十四万斤，煤油近四十桶，尚有铁锅、布匹及群众生活中的各种用品；另一种方法是赊购换购农民山货后，实行保本保实办法。这种办法群众最为欢迎，但私商因怕物价变化，不敢大量采用。这种交易关系对私商对农民均极有利，但目前仅限于亲友等旧关系，今后应扩展成为合同业务才好。
    （二）开展信托业务。用信件与外地座商建立贸易关系，可直接汇款委托对方保证代购货物和帮助推销货物。如汉口某家私商通过本镇通益栈用信件购货即达三千余万元。这样不仅节省开支，并可加速资金周转。
    （三）除组织一般联销联营外，并与外商及山地小贩组织联营。具体分工办法是产地商人负责收购，邯郸商人负责转运，外商则负责推销。如同泰、通益等栈，与汉口、林县、黎城等地商人集资联营，采购、推销、转运均有明确分工。
    （四）写信介绍商情，使外商携资来此协同收购。如通益山货栈每月平均外寄商情信件达五十余封，曾招到津、沪、石、汉等地客商多家。这种方式已使石市某商号来此收购花椒四十万斤。
    （五）吸收山地农民以实物（山货、土产）入股，仅此一项，各栈即增资金一亿多元；另说服股东暂不分红（可以红利作为新股），以积累资金。
