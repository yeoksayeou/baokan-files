    Heilongjiang Keshan Department Store
    Should Further Improve its Work
    To the Editor:
    Because the Keshan County Department Store does not pay attention to economic accounting and warehousing, it has caused a loss of 600 million yuan (Northeast currency).
    As far as we know: a lot of the department store's stock of rubber shoes, tires, and sacks have been gnawed by rats or rotted due to dampness; a lot of the sugar has also been affected by dampness and has dissolved, making it impossible to sell; kerosene barrels have been broken and are leaking a lot of oil; and intact wooden crates for loading goods have been burned as firewood. In business operations, losses are often caused by selling goods at the wrong price due to carelessness. For example, the provincial company allocated small scissors at a unit price of 230,000 yuan each, but the notification mistakenly stated 23,000 yuan; barber brushes were originally priced at 20,000 yuan each, but were mistakenly priced at 2,000 yuan. The Keshan company also felt that the price was too low and suspected there was an error, but they did not immediately ask for instructions or investigate the market price, and sold them all off to private merchants. Furthermore, the company has three retail stores, but the same goods are not priced uniformly. For example, the children's clothing made of "Dazhong Shuangsha" fabric is sold for 200,000 yuan per piece in some stores, and 210,000 yuan in others. Someone reported this situation to the business section chief, but he said, "I'll check it when I have time!" I think this is an irresponsible attitude towards work and should be criticized.
    In addition, the company lacks planning in its business operations and buys goods blindly, resulting in a large amount of capital being tied up. For example, in the autumn, the company shipped in a large quantity of summer goods, such as straw hats, raincoats, and sandals; in the winter, when farmers had already made cotton clothes, the company shipped in two train cars of cotton from outside, which has been stockpiled and cannot be sold. In such cases, more than 400 million yuan of capital has been tied up, accounting for one-third of the company's total capital.
    The reason for these situations is that the leading cadres have serious bureaucracy, and have not learned or are unwilling to learn the skills of doing business (i.e., economic accounting). Secondly, the system is chaotic, such as the lack of a system for specific responsibilities and inspection work. It is hoped that the Keshan Department Store will earnestly review these matters that damage national economic construction in order to improve its work.

    Editor's note: This newspaper published a criticism of the Keshan Department Store's failure to implement the cash management system on December 15th of last year, and later published the company's letter of self-criticism. Now, the company has caused the loss of a large number of materials due to poor management and storage. We hope that the trade authorities of Heilongjiang Province will conduct a thorough inspection of the work of the Keshan Department Store, and that the company will establish a practical and feasible work system.

### 黑龙江克山百货公司应进一步改进工作

    黑龙江克山百货公司
    应进一步改进工作编辑同志：
    克山县百货公司因为不重视经济核算工作和保管工作，以致造成六亿元（东北币、下同）物资的损失。
    据我们所知道的：该公司库存胶皮鞋、车胎、麻袋多被鼠咬或是因潮湿而腐烂了；食糖亦多受潮溶化，无法售出；煤油桶被人摔破，漏油很多；完好的装货木箱却被当作木柴烧掉。在业务经营上，常因粗枝大叶，造成错价售货的亏损。如：省公司拨给小剪刀每把单价为二十三万元，而通知单误为两万三千元；理发用的胡刷子每把原价为二万元，却误为二千元；克山公司亦觉得价格太低恐有错误，但他们并不立即请示，亦不调查市场价格，即行出售，结果全部被私商买去。又该公司有三个门市部，同样货物却不是统一价格。如大众爽纱小孩衣服，每件有卖二十万元的，也有卖二十一万元的，这种情况，有人反映给业务股长，但他却说：“等我有时间，再去查对一下吧！”我觉得这是对工作不负责的表现，应该给予批评。
    另外该公司业务经营上缺乏计划，盲目购货，以致积压了大批资金。像秋天里，该公司运来了大批夏货，如草帽、雨衣、凉鞋；冬天里农民已经做好棉衣，该公司却从外面运来两车皮棉花，以致长期积压卖不出去。像这样的情况积压的资金有四亿多，占该公司全部资金的三分之一。
    按这些情况的产生是由于领导干部有严重的官僚主义，没有能学会或不愿意学会做生意（即经济核算）的本领，其次是制度的混乱，如没有专责和检查工作的制度。这些损害国家经济建设的事情，希望克山百货公司切实加以检讨，以便改进自己的工作。
                              中共克山县委会宣传部  吴殿坤
    编者按：本报在去年十二月十五日发表了对克山百货公司不执行现金管理制度的批评，不久又刊载了该公司的检讨信件。现在，该公司又因经营和保管不善造成大批物资的损失。我们希望黑龙江省的贸易机关对克山百货公司的工作进行一个彻底的检查，该公司并应建立起切实可行的工作制度。
