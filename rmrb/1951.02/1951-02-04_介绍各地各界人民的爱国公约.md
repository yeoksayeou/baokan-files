Introducing Patriotic Pledges of People from All Walks of Life in Various Regions

Throughout the nationwide patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, defend our homes and defend the country, people from all walks of life have adopted the method of formulating patriotic pledges, combining this movement with their own specific tasks and consolidating the patriotic enthusiasm and understanding of the masses. This is a creation of the people themselves. This method can be universally promoted among people from all walks of life across the country, in every factory, mine, rural area, military unit, school, organization, and all trades and professions. We now present the following categorized examples of patriotic pledges already formulated by people from various regions and sectors as a reference for the widespread promotion of the patriotic pledge movement in various regions.

The ten patriotic action programs for Shanghai workers, adopted by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' expanded committee meeting on December 7th of last year and endorsed by workers in all industries throughout Shanghai, are: (1) All Shanghai workers must take action and participate in the sacred movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes and defend the country, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people with all effective actions, and fight resolutely and bravely to stop the war and defend lasting world peace.
