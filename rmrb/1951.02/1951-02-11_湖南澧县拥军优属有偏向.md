    Hunan Lixian's Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families-of-Revolutionary-Armymen and Martyrs Has Bias

To the Editor:
    Lixian County, Hunan Province, established a Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families Committee on December 19th of last year. On the 20th and 21st, districts and townships also established Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families Committees. After cadres at all levels went deep to mobilize day and night, and on the basis of voluntary participation by the masses, by the 24th, the county had raised 100 million yuan in donations (50% of the total task).
    The Third District's method was as follows: Comrade Han Fengzhou, the district party secretary, attended the district party secretary meeting on the 19th. On the evening of the 20th, he convened a full district cadre meeting to convey the spirit of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs during the New Year period. Subsequently, the Guanyuan Township work team and the Mengjiang Township work team immediately challenged each other. Someone proposed: "In this donation drive, whoever falls behind will be fined two packs of cigarettes, four jin of peanuts, and three jin of sugar." Everyone unanimously approved. That night, the cadres went down to the villages and held meetings overnight, mobilizing individuals. By daybreak (the morning of the 21st), Mengjiang Township, the most backward in the Third District, had completed 1.55 million yuan, exceeding the original task by 550,000 yuan. By the 23rd, the entire district had completed the task of 20 million yuan.
                                            Wang Yuting, Cao Xinmin

    Editor's Note: This letter originally intended to commend Lixian County's work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs; however, it is clear that the methods of the Guanyuan Township and Mengjiang Township work teams in the Third District of Lixian County were wrong. Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families work must be carried out after in-depth explanation and on the basis of voluntary participation by the masses. However, the Guanyuan Township and Mengjiang Township work teams adopted methods of mutual challenge, competition, and cigarette fines, and went down to the villages overnight, demanding the completion of the "task" in a short period of one or two days. In reality, it is impossible to conduct thorough mobilization and achieve mass consciousness and voluntariness. On the contrary, it is very likely to cause dissatisfaction among the masses and become detached from the masses. It is hoped that the Lixian County People's Government will inspect this Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families work and remedy the negative impact caused among the masses.

### 湖南澧县拥军优属有偏向

专栏：读者来信

    湖南澧县拥军优属有偏向编辑同志：
    湖南省澧县在去年十二月十九日成立了拥军优属委员会。二十日、二十一日两天中，各区乡也建立起拥军优属委员会。经过各级干部日夜不停地深入动员，在群众自愿基础上，到二十四日止，全县已劝募捐款一亿元（占总任务百分之五十）。
    三区的作法是这样的：该区区委书记韩凤洲同志在十九日参加了区委书记会议。二十日的晚上，他就召开了全区干部大会，传达了年关拥军优属的精神。接着，官元乡工作组与梦姜乡工作组等当场挑战。有人提出：“这一次劝募工作，谁要落后，就得罚两条纸烟，四斤花生，三斤糖。”大家一致通过。当晚干部们就下乡，连夜召开会议，个别动员。到了天明（二十一日早晨），在三区最落后的梦姜乡就完成了一百五十五万元，超过原定任务五十五万元。到二十三日，全区二千万元的任务全部完成。
                                             王雨亭、曹新民
    编者按：这封信原来是要表扬澧县拥军优属工作的；但是，显然澧县三区官元乡与梦姜乡工作组的作法是错误的。拥军优属工作，必须经过深入解释说明，在群众自愿的基础上展开；官元乡与梦姜乡工作组却采取了互相挑战竞赛、罚纸烟的办法，并连夜下乡，要在一两天短促的时间中完成“任务”，这实际上不可能深入动员，做到群众自觉自愿；相反，很可能引起群众不满，脱离群众。希望澧县人民政府对这次拥军优属工作进行检查，补救在群众中造成的不良影响。
