    Leaders of Taiyuan Railway Factory Separated from the Masses; Production Suffered Serious Losses

    In the past year, the Taiyuan Railway Factory failed to complete its production tasks for seven months. This was mainly due to the factory's leaders not relying on the workers, not valuing their opinions, and not inspiring their enthusiasm, instead relying solely on administrative orders. The main manifestations are as follows: (1) Last year, the factory's employees put forward more than one hundred rationalization proposals regarding production, but the leadership did not study them; instead, they simply ordered workers to work overtime to rush production. In some workshops, workers even had no time for meetings and study because they were rushing to complete tasks. During the renovation of the workshop in October and November last year, construction workers were dismantling wooden frames on the workshop, while workers were still ordered to continue production below. Mechanic Li Jincai believed this was too dangerous and suggested that the factory change the production schedule, but the leadership ignored him. As a result, worker Zhang Xiuwen was killed by a wooden frame falling from above. However, this lesson did not attract the leadership's attention. They only perfunctorily ordered each workshop to cover the frames with canvas and continue working, resulting in a second accident: the frame collapsed, killing three workers, including Zhang Pengnian, and injuring as many as eleven. From January to October last year, a total of 325 workers were injured on the job. (2) The bureaucracy of the leadership is also manifested in the fact that, apart from counting numbers and issuing work orders, they rarely go deep into the field to solve problems. The factory's engineering section still does not know the actual production capacity of each workshop. The production task for the vehicle section in January this year was assigned in December last year, but by January 10th, the forging section had not yet started making parts. At the end of November last year, the factory decided that the locomotive section, riveting section, and machining section would install high cars, but half a month passed without any action; it was not until the beginning of January this year, when new production tasks were assigned, that they began to rush the installation. (3) Not following the mass line. When the factory was evaluating awards and selecting models in July last year, the leadership replaced the mass selection movement with a designated method. In the adjustment of wages, they did not mobilize the masses for democratic evaluation, but only relied on a few cadres to do it, which affected the workers' enthusiasm for production. Because the leadership did not rely on the workers' ideas, the factory's management committee was limited to assigning tasks, and the meeting frequency decreased from once every half month to once a month, and then to once every month and a half, gradually becoming a formality. Worker Yao Gaofu also said: "When the management committee was first established, I had great confidence and put forward four or five rationalization proposals. But I never got a response after one or two times, so I will never make any more suggestions."

    Another reason for not completing the tasks is that the factory is not serious and responsible enough when accepting tasks. For example, when accepting the locomotive overhaul task, it was found that the actual overhaul schedule was larger than the originally planned one, but it was not reported to the higher authorities in a timely manner. Sometimes, even after work has started, the materials and tools are not fully prepared.

    In order to complete the arduous production tasks of 1951, the factory must effectively mobilize and organize the masses, and overcome the purely task-oriented viewpoint that does not rely on the workers and proceeds from subjective wishes.

    Editor's note: The serious consequences of the Taiyuan Railway Factory not relying on the working class in production should arouse the high attention and vigilance of the factory's Party, government, and trade union leaders. One of the fundamental differences between enterprises in a new democratic country and bureaucratic capitalist enterprises is that old capitalist enterprises rely on oppressive methods to force workers to produce, while new democratic enterprises must inspire and rely on the masses of workers to give play to their production enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, the bureaucratic leadership style of the Taiyuan Railway Factory, which disregards workers' health and safety, does not value workers' rationalization proposals, and does not follow the mass line, is intolerable and must be corrected immediately. The factory's superior leading organs should effectively inspect and supervise the factory's work to ensure workers' safe production and the completion of national production tasks.

### 太原铁路工厂领导干部脱离群众生产遭受严重损失

    太原铁路工厂领导干部脱离群众生产遭受严重损失
    太原铁路工厂在去年一年中，有七个月没有完成生产任务。这主要是由于该厂领导干部不依靠工人，不重视工人的意见、启发群众积极性，单纯靠行政命令办事。其主要表现如下：（一）去年全厂职工先后提了一百多项关于生产的合理化建议，可是领导上对此并没有进行研究；却单纯命令工人加班加点去突击生产，有的车间甚至因赶活，工人开会与学习也没有时间。在去年十、十一两月补修工房时，建筑工人在工房上拆木架，仍叫工人继续在下面生产。机工李进财认为这样太危险，建议厂方改变生产时间，但领导上置之不理，结果工人张修文就被工房上面掉下来的木架砸死。但这一教训仍没有引起领导上的重视，只马虎地命令各修房车间遮上帆布继续干活，结果又发生了第二次事故：房架塌毁，砸死了张朋年等三个工人，砸伤的达十一名之多。从去年一月至十月，工人因公受伤的共有三百二十五名。（二）领导上的官僚主义还表现在除了要统计数目字，下达工作命令外，很少深入现场解决问题。工厂工务科到现在还不知道各车间的实际生产能力。车辆所今年一月份的生产任务，在去年十二月就分配下来，但到了一月十日，锻工所还未开始制件。去年十一月底，厂方决定机车所、铆工所、机工所按装高车，可是时间过去了半个月，还未动手；一直到今年一月初，新的生产任务分配下来时，才开始突击安装。（三）不走群众路线。去年七月工厂评奖选模范时，领导上用指定的办法代替了群众的评选运动。在调整工资中，也不发动群众民主评议，仅凭几个干部来搞，这样就影响了群众的生产积极性。由于领导上没有依靠工人的思想，该厂管委会仅限于分配任务，会议期限也由半月一次而一月一次，而一个半月一次了。日渐流于形式。工人姚高福也说：“管委会刚成立时，我信心很大，提了四五条合理化建议。可是一次二次总得不到回答，今后再也不提了。”
    完不成任务的另一原因，是工厂在接受任务时不够认真负责。例如接受机车检修任务时，已发现实际修程较原定的修程大，但也不及时向上级提出。甚至有时已经开始工作，还没有把材料和工具准备齐全。
    为了完成一九五一年繁重的生产任务，该厂必须很好的发动与组织群众，克服那种不依靠工人，从主观愿望出发的单纯任务观点。
          读者  萧文
    编者按：太原铁路工厂不依靠工人阶级，在生产上所产生的严重恶果，应引起该厂党、政、工会领导干部的高度重视和警惕。新民主主义国家企业与官僚资本企业的根本区别之一，就是旧的资本主义企业是靠压迫方法来强制工人进行生产，而新民主主义企业则必须启发和依靠工人群众，发挥他们的生产积极性和创造性。因此，太原铁路工厂不顾工人健康和安全，不重视工人合理化建议，不走群众路线的官僚主义领导作风，是不能容忍的，必须立即纠正。该工厂的上级领导机关对该厂工作应切实检查督促，以保障工人安全生产和国家生产任务的完成。
