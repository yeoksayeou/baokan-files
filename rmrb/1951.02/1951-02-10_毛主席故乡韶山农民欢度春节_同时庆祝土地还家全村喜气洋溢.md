Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 9th: Our correspondent visited Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Chairman Mao's hometown, during the Spring Festival. This township had just completed land reform before the Spring Festival, and all the farmers in the township were immersed in the joy of multiple happy events. The farmers cleaned their villages and farmhouses very thoroughly, and most of the farmers' doors were plastered with bright red Spring Festival couplets. The couplets mostly had new content, such as slogans celebrating land distribution and calling for production. The farmers were all wearing new clothes, and many children were dressed beautifully. The children and young people were jumping and frolicking everywhere, and the song "Go! Follow Mao Zedong!" could be heard everywhere.

The farmers in Shaoshan Township combined the celebration of the Spring Festival with the celebration of the return of land to the farmers, and held a grand celebration meeting on the first day of the Spring Festival. At the same time, twelve conscious and outstanding farmers who had been tested in the land reform movement were accepted as members of the Communist Party by the township's Communist Party branch, and held a solemn oath-taking ceremony to join the Party. On this day, the township was filled with the sound of gongs and drums all day long, and the yangko teams dressed up by the children were celebrating the Spring Festival to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. The cultural troupe and film projection team sent by the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League also arrived in Shaoshan Township during the Spring Festival to perform and show movies for the farmers.

This year, the farmers of Shaoshan Township had a happy and rich Spring Festival. Many poor peasant families slaughtered "New Year's pigs" for the first time this year. Poor peasant Zhou Lihua insisted on inviting reporters to his home for dinner because he had slaughtered a New Year's pig. Another farmer, Su Shaotang, who had been a farmhand for many years, told reporters that in the past, his family had no rice to cook for the Spring Festival, and debt collectors sat in his house demanding payment. Spending the Spring Festival was like going through the gates of hell. Last year, they already had rice to cook and no one was collecting debts. This year is even better. His family has been allocated more than five mu of land, and they bought ten catties of meat and five catties of oil for the Spring Festival, and all five members of the family are wearing new clothes. When the farmers of Shaoshan Township talked about this year's Spring Festival, they all said that it was thanks to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's former residence was also open to visitors, and the manager, Zhang Laohan, led the reporters to visit Chairman Mao's former bedroom and study. Many of Chairman Mao's old friends told reporters about Chairman Mao's past events. Zou Puxun, a farmhand who had studied with Chairman Mao when he was a child, talked the most. He had not seen Chairman Mao for more than twenty years, and he missed him very much when he mentioned him, saying repeatedly, "How wonderful it would be to see Chairman Mao again!"

Now, the Shaoshan Township Farmers' Association and every farmer's family are planning this year's spring ploughing production. They are confident to strive for a more beautiful and happier life that is coming their way. When the reporters left Shaoshan, many farmers enthusiastically instructed: Come back and see us in the autumn, our situation will be even better than it is now.

　　毛主席故乡
    韶山农民欢度春节      
    同时庆祝土地还家全村喜气洋溢
    【新华社长沙九日电】新华社记者在春节中访问了毛主席的故乡湖南湘潭县韶山乡。这个乡在春节前刚完成了土地改革，全乡农民正沉浸在重重喜事的欢乐里。农民们把村子和农舍都打扫得很清洁，农家门前大都贴有鲜红的春联。春联多是新内容，是些庆祝分田和号召生产的标语。农民们都穿着新衣，许多孩子打扮得漂漂亮亮。孩子们、青年们到处跳跳蹦蹦嘻嘻哈哈，到处有“走！跟着毛泽东走！”的歌声。
    韶山乡的农民们把庆祝春节和庆祝土地还家放在一起，在春节第一天举行了一个盛大的庆祝大会。同时，还有十二个觉悟的、在土地改革运动中经过考验的优秀的农民，经该乡共产党支部接受为党员，举行隆重的入党宣誓。这一天该乡整天都响着锣鼓声，孩子们扮的秧歌队，在向革命烈士家属和军人家属贺春节。新民主主义青年团中央文化服务团所派出的文工队和电影放映队，也在春节到了韶山乡，为农民们演戏和放电影。
    今年韶山乡农民的春节过得又快乐又丰富，许多贫农家庭今年第一次杀了“过年猪”。贫农周立华因为杀了过年猪，执意邀请记者上他家吃饭。另一个当了多年长工的农民苏少堂告诉记者说：过去他家春节没米下锅，逼债的在家中坐催，过春节像过鬼门关。去年过春节时已经有米下锅没人逼债了。今年就更好了，他家已经分得了五亩多田，过春节买了十斤肉五斤油，一家五口都穿了新衣。韶山乡农民谈起今年的春节，都说这是托毛主席的福。
    毛主席的故居也为访问者开放了，管理人张老汉领着记者们参观了毛主席当年的卧室和读书的地方。许多毛主席的故友，向记者谈了一些毛主席的往事，一位幼年时和毛主席曾经同学念书的雇农邹普勋谈得最多。他已经二十多年不见毛主席了，提起来非常怀念，连说：“什么时候再见见毛主席多好啊！”
    现在，韶山乡农民协会和每一个农家都在计划今年的春耕生产，他们有信心争取正迎面而来的更美丽和更幸福的生活。当记者离开韶山时，许多农民热情地嘱咐说：秋天再来看看吧，那时候我们的光景会比现在更好。
