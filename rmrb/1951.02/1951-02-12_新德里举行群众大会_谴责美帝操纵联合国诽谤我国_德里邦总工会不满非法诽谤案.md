　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 11th: The Delhi State Committee of the Communist Party of India initiated a mass rally in Gandhi Square, New Delhi, on the 8th, and passed a resolution condemning the United Nations for slandering China as an "aggressor." The meeting declared that the UN resolution was illegal because it was passed without the presence of the rightful representative of the People's Republic of China and under the pressure of the American imperialists. Moreover, as can be seen from the votes of India, the Soviet Union, and other countries, the passage of this resolution also violated the wishes of the majority of the world's people. The conference welcomed the attitude adopted by the Indian government's representative to the United Nations, believing that it was conducive to Asian and world peace. The meeting also called for strengthening friendly ties with New China and the Soviet Union. The meeting further demanded that the People's Republic of China be admitted to the United Nations, that foreign troops withdraw from Korea and Taiwan, and that China's sovereignty over Taiwan be recognized.
　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 11th: At its February 4th meeting, the Delhi State Federation of Trade Unions' Working Committee condemned the United Nations' resolution to slander China as an "aggressor" in Korea. The Working Committee believes that the United States was able to pass this resolution in the United Nations by relying on coercion. The voting situation clearly shows that the majority of the world's people represented in the United Nations are opposed to the American plan. The committee passed a resolution congratulating the Indian representative, Rau, for expressing the anti-imperialist sentiments of the Indian people and opposing the American war plan.
　　The Working Committee also passed a resolution condemning the French government for banning organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the Women's International Democratic Federation, which represent millions of organized workers, youth, and women around the world and guide them in their struggle for national independence and peace. The meeting demanded that the ban be lifted immediately.

　　德里邦总工会不满非法诽谤案
    【新华社新德里十一日电】印度共产党德里邦委员会于八日发起在新德里的甘地广场举行了一次群众大会，并通过决议，谴责联合国诽谤中国为“侵略者”。会议宣称：联合国的决议是非法的，因为决议是在中华人民共和国应有的代表没有出席的情形下，及美帝国主义者的压力之下通过的。而且从印度、苏联与其他各国的投票上可以看出，这个决议的通过也是违反世界大多数人民的愿望的。大会欢迎印度政府派往联合国的代表所采的态度，认为这是有利于亚洲及世界和平的。会议并要求加强与新中国及苏联的友好联系。会议进一步要求接纳中华人民共和国出席联合国，外国军队自朝鲜与台湾撤退，并承认中国对台湾的主权等。
    【新华社新德里十一日电】德里邦总工会工作委员会在二月四日会议上，非难联合国诬蔑中国为对朝鲜的“侵略者”的决议。工作委员会认为美国之所以能在联合国中通过这一决议，是靠了胁迫的力量。表决情形清楚地说明，在联合国中派有代表的世界大多数人民都反对美国的计划。该委员会通过一项决议，祝贺印度代表劳氏表达了印度人民反帝国主义的情绪并且反对美国的战争计划。
    工作委员会又通过一项决议，谴责法国政府禁止代表全世界成百万有组织的工人、青年与妇女并且指导他们为民族独立与和平而奋斗的世界工联、世界民主青联与世界民主妇联等团体。会议要求立即取消该项禁令。
