　　Thailand's Luang Phibunsakdi reactionary government
　  Plots large-scale persecution of overseas Chinese
    [Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 17th] Bangkok News: Since the signing of the US-Thai military agreement last October, the Luang Phibunsakdi reactionary government of Thailand, under the instigation of US imperialism, has intensified its anti-Chinese measures. While the Thai government is persecuting the democratic Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao," it is now actively plotting to implement a so-called "restricted area regulation," attempting to persecute our compatriots on a larger scale and destroy the overseas Chinese industry and commerce, so that US imperialism and Thai bureaucratic capital can arbitrarily plunder the property earned by our Thai compatriots with their blood and sweat for many years. According to this "restricted area regulation" drafted by Thai parliamentarian Nai Thongpoon, the Thai government will designate eighteen provinces as "restricted areas": Bangkok, Thonburi, Lampang, Lopburi, Saraburi, Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, Surin, Roi Et, Ratchaburi, Phetchaburi, Rayong, Prachinburi, Songkhla, Uttaradit, Chiang Mai, and Phitsanulok. "Foreigners" are not allowed to reside, stay, or travel within the "restricted areas." "Foreigners" originally residing in the "restricted areas" must move out within sixty days after the promulgation of the regulation. Among these eighteen provinces, Bangkok and Thonburi are the most concentrated areas of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and the other provinces are also densely populated areas of overseas Chinese. Once this regulation is implemented, the vast number of our compatriots will be displaced and unable to make a living.
    As early as before the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Luang Phibunsakdi had designated seven provinces as restricted areas, and many overseas Chinese were thus ruined. The overseas Chinese in Thailand have fresh memories of the deep and painful wounds of the past. They are extremely indignant at this more vicious new conspiracy of the Luang Phibunsakdi government and are now strongly opposing this conspiracy of persecution by the Thai reactionary government.

　　泰国銮披汶反动政府
　  阴谋大规模迫害华侨
    【新华社十七日讯】曼谷消息：自去年十月美泰军事协定签定后，泰国銮披汶反动政府在美帝国主义指使下，更变本加厉地进行其排华措施。泰国政府与迫害民主华侨报纸《全民报》的同时，现正积极阴谋实施一个所谓“禁区条例”，企图更大规模地迫害我国侨胞，摧残华侨工商业，以便美帝国主义及泰国官僚资本任意掠夺我旅泰侨胞多年以血汗挣得的财产。按照泰国国会议员乃通奔所草拟的这一“禁区条例”，泰国政府将规定京畿府（包括曼谷）、吞武里府、喃邦府、华富里府、北标府、乌隆府、呵叻府、乌汶府、素辇府、黎逸府、叻丕府、佛丕府、罗勇府、巴真府、宋卡府、程逸府、清迈府及彭世洛府十八府为“禁区”。“外侨”不得在“禁区”范围内居住、居留或旅行。原在“禁区”居住的“外侨”，要在该条例颁布后六十天内迁出。在这十八府中，曼谷和吞武里是泰国华侨最集中的地方，其他各府也都是华侨密集的地区。这一条例一旦实施，我广大侨胞势将流离失所，无以为生。
    銮披汶早在一九四一年太平洋战争爆发前，就曾划定过七府为禁区，很多华侨即因此倾家荡产。泰国华侨对过去的深痛巨创，记忆犹新，他们对銮披汶政府这一更加恶毒的新阴谋，极为愤慨，现正极力反对泰国反动政府这一迫害的阴谋。
