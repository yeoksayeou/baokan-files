Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Song Qingling, Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Administration, sent a letter to Japanese democratic parties, mass organizations, and the "Comprehensive Peace and Patriotic Movement Council," expressing firm support for the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S. imperialist scheme to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and arm Japan. The letter is as follows:

To be forwarded to Tokyo:

To the respected peace-loving Japanese friends of the Japanese democratic parties, mass organizations, and the "Comprehensive Peace and Patriotic Movement Council"!

U.S. imperialism has suffered three heavy blows in its adventurous war of aggression against Korea from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. In a vain attempt to salvage its hopeless fate, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its scheme to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and accelerate the arming of Japan. The basic purpose of this U.S. imperialist scheme is to revive the remnants of Japanese militarism and make them serve as a new tool of aggression for U.S. imperialism in Asia. This is a complete violation of the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan of June 19, 1947. This criminal scheme has aroused great anger and resolute opposition from the Chinese and Asian people.

The Chinese people, after a long struggle and painful sacrifices, overthrew the vicious enemy of Japanese imperialism, and then paid a heavy price to overthrow the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism not only created a civil war for the Chinese people, killing millions of Chinese people, but it also consistently participated in or led the imperialist bloc in ruthlessly exploiting, oppressing, and invading China, creating a series of major disasters for China. The Chinese people have worked hard for more than a year to initially heal the war wounds brought about by U.S. imperialism. Therefore, we will never tolerate U.S. imperialism rearming Japan and reviving the reactionary forces in Japan to continue harming the Chinese people. Moreover, this U.S. imperialist scheme attempts to turn Japan into an American colony, force the Japanese working masses to serve as cannon fodder, and lead the Japanese people to destruction!

The Chinese and Japanese people have a long history of cultural exchange, and both peoples love peace and oppose wars of aggression. Therefore, the Japanese people are friends of the Chinese people, but the remnants of Japanese militarism who oppress the Japanese people and betray the interests of the Japanese nation are our mortal enemies, and U.S. imperialism, which colludes with our mortal enemies, is our double mortal enemy. U.S. imperialism is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people and the people of the world to the end. The Chinese and Japanese people should work hand in hand more closely to oppose the common enemy - U.S. imperialism.

Peace-loving Japanese friends! For your safety and survival, for your freedom and independence, for your lasting peace and the lasting peace of mankind, let us unite and, under the correct leadership of the most heroic and revolutionary advanced class, fight to smash the shackles of slavery! Fight against the heinous plan of U.S. imperialism to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, which creates disaster! Resolutely conclude a comprehensive (including the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union) peace treaty in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, so that the Japanese people in dire straits can be liberated as soon as possible.

The 475 million Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, are firmly supporting your just struggle. Your struggle will surely be victorious!

Song Qingling
Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Administration

　　中国人民救济总会主席
    宋庆龄函日本民主党派和团体
    表示坚决支持日本人民反对美国武装日本
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄致函日本各民主党派、群众团体暨“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，表示坚决支持日本人民反对美帝国主义片面对日缔结和约和武装日本的阴谋活动。该函如下：东京转
    日本各民主党派、群众团体暨“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”敬爱的日本爱好和平的朋友们！
    美帝国主义在侵朝的冒险战争中，已遭到朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军三次沉重打击。美帝国主义为了妄想挽救它那无法挽救的命运，因而加紧片面对日缔结和约和加速进行武装日本的阴谋活动，美帝国主义这一阴谋活动的基本目的，是在于复活日本军国主义残余分子，使之充当美帝国主义在亚洲的新侵略工具。这是完全违背了开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告与一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的。这一罪恶的阴谋已引起了中国和亚洲广大人民的极大愤怒和坚决反对。
    中国人民经过了长期的斗争和惨痛的牺牲，才打倒了日本帝国主义这个凶恶的敌人，又付出了重大的代价，才推翻了美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮的血腥统治。美帝国主义不但给中国人民制造了内战，杀死中国数百万人，而且它过去一贯参加或领导帝国主义集团无情剥削、压迫、侵略中国，制造了中国一连串的大灾难。中国人民经过了一年多的努力奋斗，才初步医治了美帝国主义所带来的战争创伤。因此，我们决不能容忍美帝国主义重新武装日本，复活日本的反动势力，继续危害中国人民。并且，美帝国主义这一阴谋活动，是企图变日本为美国殖民地，强迫日本劳苦大众充当其炮灰，引导日本人民走向毁灭！
    中、日两国人民有着悠久的文化交流，两国人民都是酷爱和平反对侵略战争的。因此，日本人民是中国人民的朋友，但是压迫日本人民与出卖日本民族利益的日本军国主义残余分子乃是我们的死对头，和我们的死对头相勾结的美帝国主义乃是我们双料的死对头。美帝国主义存心和中、日人民与世界人民为敌到底。中、日两国人民更应当紧密地携起手来，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    日本爱好和平的朋友们！为了你们的安全与生存，为了你们的自由与独立，为了你们的持久和平与世界人类的持久和平，大家要团结一致，在最英勇最革命的先进阶级的正确领导下，为粉碎奴隶枷锁而斗争！为反对制造灾难的美帝国主义单独对日媾和重新武装日本的罪恶计划而斗争！坚决依据开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和远东委员会对投降后日本的基本政策，迅速缔结全面（包括中华人民共和国与苏联参加）和约，使水深火热中的日本人民早日获得解放。
    中国四亿七千五百万人民，亚洲和全世界所有爱好和平的人民，都在坚强地支持着你们的正义斗争。你们的斗争一定会得到胜利的！
      中国人民救济总会主席  宋庆龄
                一九五一年二月十九日
