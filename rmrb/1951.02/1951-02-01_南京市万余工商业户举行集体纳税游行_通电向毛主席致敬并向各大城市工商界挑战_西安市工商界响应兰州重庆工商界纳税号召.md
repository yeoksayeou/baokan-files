Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th. Over ten thousand industrial and commercial households in Nanjing held a collective parade on the 28th to pay their 1950 autumn business tax. The 28th was the first day of the collection of the autumn business tax in Nanjing last year. The industries that decided to participate in the collective tax payment set off early in the morning, forming a several-mile-long procession to the designated location of the tax bureau to collectively pay their taxes. The procession was welcomed by people from all walks of life along the way, and finally, a celebration meeting was held at the tax bureau. The marchers enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Support the new tax law, complete the new tasks" and "Enthusiastically pay taxes, consolidate national defense." At the celebration meeting, telegrams were passed to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and challenge the industrial and commercial circles in major cities such as Shanghai. The telegram to Chairman Mao said: "We would like to report to you that under your wise leadership, the industrial and commercial circles in Nanjing have overcome the difficulties left by the Kuomintang reactionaries and have initially improved; and have realized the crimes of American imperialism in destroying industry and commerce in the past, and have acted under the banner of patriotism. We are determined to guarantee to you: resolutely support the new tax law, complete the new tasks, and enhance the strength to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, so that American imperialism will tremble before the Chinese people under your leadership!" In the telegram to Shanghai and the industrial and commercial circles in major cities across the country, in addition to reporting the collective tax payment situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Nanjing this time, it also put forward "Quick assessment, quick payment, fairness and reason, and no household missed" as the conditions for the competition.

After the industrial and commercial circles in Nanjing studied current events related to resisting America and aiding Korea, their patriotic enthusiasm generally increased. In addition to paying the winter business tax ahead of schedule last month, they also launched the evaluation work for the autumn business tax in the middle of this month. Because everyone, under the slogan of "serious evaluation, early evaluation, early payment," broke through considerations of personal relationships and mutually supervised and encouraged each other, the business tax, which used to take more than a month to evaluate, was completed in just over ten days through initial evaluation, re-evaluation, and household evaluation, and a wave of collective tax payment was launched. Because all industries were eager to pay collectively and compete for the glorious red flag, the tax revenue collected on the first day of collection reached 91% of the tax payable. Including the thirty-seven industries that have already paid collectively in advance, eighty-six industries have already paid taxes, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of taxpayers.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th. The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce sent a telegram to the industrial and commercial circles in Lanzhou, Chongqing, and major cities across the country on the 25th, responding to the tax payment call from the industrial and commercial circles in Lanzhou and Chongqing. The telegram reported that the evaluation work for the fourth quarter business tax of the previous year in Xi'an has come to an end, and it has been decided to complete the tax revenue collection before the Lunar New Year. Lanzhou completed its 1950 tax revenue collection by the end of last year and sent a letter and telegram to the national industrial and commercial circles at that time, reporting on its tax revenue achievements and calling for active tax payment.

　　南京市万余工商业户举行集体纳税游行
    通电向毛主席致敬并向各大城市工商界挑战
    西安市工商界响应兰州重庆工商界纳税号召
    【新华社南京三十日电】南京市一万工商业户于二十八日举行集体缴纳一九五○年秋季营业税大游行。二十八日为南京市去年秋季营业税开征的第一天，决定参加集体纳税的行业，清早便分头出发，他们汇成了长达数里的队伍，前往税务局指定地点集体缴纳税款。队伍沿途受到各界人民的欢迎，最后到税务局开庆祝大会。游行者热烈地高呼“拥护新税法，完成新任务”，“踊跃纳税，巩固国防”等口号。在庆祝大会上通过了向毛主席致敬和向上海等大城市工商界挑战的电文。给毛主席的致敬电中说：“我们谨向您报告，南京工商界已在您的英明领导下克服了国民党反动派所遗留下来的困难，初步好转；并认识了美帝过去摧残工商业的罪行，在爱国主义旗帜下行动起来。我们决向您保证：坚决拥护新税法，完成新任务，增强抗美援朝保家卫国的力量，让美帝在您领导下的中国人民面前发抖！”在向上海及全国各大城市工商界挑战的电文中，除报告南京市工商界这次集体纳税的情况外，还提出了“评得快、交得快、公平合理、一户不漏”为竞赛的条件。
    南京市工商界经抗美援朝时事学习后，爱国情绪即普遍提高。除在上月提前缴纳了冬季营业税外，又在本月中旬展开了秋季营业税的评议工作。由于大家在“认真评议，早评早交”的口号下，破除了情面，相互督促与鼓励，使一向需一个多月才能评议完成的营业税，仅十多天即全部完成初评、复评、户评等步骤，并展开了集体纳税的热潮。由于各行业都争先集体缴纳，争夺光荣红旗，开征第一天入库税款即达应纳税款的百分之九十一。已经缴纳税款的行业，连同已提前集体缴纳的三十七个行业在内，已有八十六个，占全部纳税户数的百分之九十以上。
    【新华社西安三十日电】西安市工商业联合会于二十五日向兰州、重庆及全国各大城市工商界发出通电，响应兰州、重庆工商界的纳税号召。电文中报告西安市上年第四季度营业税的评议工作已告结束，决定在农历年前完成入库任务。按兰州市于去年年底即已完成一九五○年的税收任务，当时曾向全国工商界发出函电，报告完成税收成绩，号召踊跃纳税。
