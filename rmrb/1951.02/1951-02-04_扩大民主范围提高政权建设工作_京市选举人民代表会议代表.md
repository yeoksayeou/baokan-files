　　Expanding the Scope of Democracy and Enhancing Political Power Construction
    Beijing Elects Representatives to the People's Congress
    [Report from this newspaper] The election of representatives to the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress is underway. As of February 2nd, according to incomplete statistics, 167 representatives to the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress have been elected. These include: representatives of political parties - five representatives from the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, three representatives from the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and three representatives from the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; representatives of people's organizations - 115 representatives from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Student Union, and the Beijing Municipal Branch of the People's Relief Association of China, etc.; representatives of employees of public-owned industrial and mining enterprises - 11 representatives from the Clothing Factory, the Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Beijing Railway Trade Union, and the Retail Company, etc.; representatives of faculty, staff, and students from specialized colleges and universities - six representatives from Normal University, the Russian Language Institute, and the Journalism School, etc.; 24 representatives from districts one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, and nine.
    In order to unify the leadership of this city-wide representative election work, the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress Consultative Committee established a city-wide election committee on January 25th. Since the 27th, each unit has begun to carry out election propaganda work, and then began to conduct elections. In the election process of each unit, generally, an election committee was first established, and a list of candidates was proposed through consultation, and then it was taken to the masses for discussion and deliberation. After the majority of the masses agreed, the election was carried out. In accordance with the resolution of the Fourth Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress on the method of representative production, the representatives of public-owned industrial and mining enterprises, specialized colleges and universities, and some people's organizations were directly elected through the election congress, while the regional representatives and the representatives of other people's organizations were elected through the election representative congress. Due to the expansion of the democratic scope of this election, not only has the broad masses of the people's understanding of the people's democratic system been improved, but also the construction of the people's democratic dictatorship in Beijing will be greatly improved.
    However, some cadres in some units did not pay enough attention to this election work, did not focus on publicizing the significance of expanding the democratic scope of this election, and did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the proposed list of candidates was fully discussed and deliberated by the masses, and hastily carried out the election. The Municipal Election Committee is correcting these phenomena.

　　扩大民主范围提高政权建设工作
    京市选举人民代表会议代表
    【本报讯】京市第三届各界人民代表会议的代表选举工作，正进行中。到二月二日止，据不完全的统计，已选出出席第三届各界人民代表会议的代表一百六十七人。其中包括党派代表中国国民党革命委员会北京市分会代表五人，民主建国会北京市分会代表三人，中国民主促进会北京市分会代表三人；人民团体代表北京市总工会、工商联合会筹委会、学生联合会、人民救济总会北京市分会等代表一百十五人；公营工矿企业职工代表被服厂、农业机械厂、北京区铁路工会、零售公司等代表十一人；专科以上学校教职员工学生代表师范大学、俄文专科学校、新闻专科学校等代表六人。区域代表第一、二、三、四、六、七、八、九等区代表二十四人。
    为了统一领导这次全市的代表选举工作，第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会于一月二十五日成立了全市的选举委员会，各单位自二十七日起，即开始进行选举的宣传工作，随即开始进行选举。在各单位选举过程中，一般的都是先成立了选举委员会，经过协商提出候选人名单，然后拿到群众中去讨论酝酿，经过了大多数群众同意后再进行选举。依照京市第二届第四次各界人民代表会议关于代表产生办法的决议，各公营工矿企业、专科以上学校及一部分人民团体的代表都是通过选举大会直接选出的，区域代表和另一部分人民团体代表，则是经过选举代表大会选出的。由于这次扩大了选举的民主范围，不但提高了广大人民对人民民主制度的认识，同时，也将使京市人民民主专政的政权建设，大大地提高一步。
    但是有些单位的干部对这次的选举工作不够重视，没有着重宣传此次选举扩大民主范围的意义，也没有充分注意使所提出的候选人名单经过群众充分的讨论酝酿，即草率进行选举，市选举委员会针对这些现象，正加以纠正。
