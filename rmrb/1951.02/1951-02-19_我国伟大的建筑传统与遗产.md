　　Our Great Architectural Tradition and Heritage
　　Liang Sicheng
            The Oldest, Longest-Living, and Most Dynamic Architectural System in the World
    Every culture in history has produced its own architecture, flourishing and declining with that culture. Among the world's existing cultures, apart from our neighbor India, whose culture can be considered a roughly contemporary brother, the Chinese nation's culture is the oldest and longest-lived. Our architecture is also the oldest and longest-lived system. In history, other cultures that formed roughly at the same time as Chinese culture, or earlier or later, such as Egypt, Babylon, slightly later ancient Persia, ancient Greece, and even later ancient Rome, have become historical relics. Our Chinese culture, however, has been passed down through generations, vigorously growing and developing for over four thousand years, all in one breath. Today, we inherit an extremely rich legacy, and our new strength is developing and flourishing. On the eve of this high tide of cultural construction, it is necessary for us to re-recognize this great and glorious architectural tradition.
    Since ancient times, we have been constantly building, initially to solve our needs for space for accommodation, work, rest, and travel, to solve the oppression of wind, rain, cold, and heat, and to facilitate our daily life and production labor. However, in an era of high culture, architecture takes on more tasks in terms of spiritual and material aspects. The people of our motherland have grown up in the architectural environment created by ourselves. We will consciously or subconsciously love the traditional types of our architecture and their social significance combined with our lives for thousands of years, such as our streets, residences, villages, courtyards, city buildings, bridges, temples, pagodas, city walls, bell towers, and so on. We will also consciously or intuitively love the objective artistic value of our architecture, such as its magnificence or its simplicity, its craftsmanship and bold structure, or its intimate deployment and simple order. They are the traditions of our nation, matured and improved through generations of labor practice and combined with practical use. It is the collective creation of craftsmen and people of a great nation in their life practice.
    Therefore, a corner tower of our hometown, a few courtyards, a paifang, a street, a row of shops, as well as the bridge in our suburbs, the pagoda in front of the mountain, the ancient tombstone in the village, the short walls and three or five thatched cottages in the village, are all so lovely and meaningful to us. They have all enriched our lives and thoughts, and become the content of emotions inseparable from us.
    Since ancient times, the people of our Chinese nation have constantly loved our architecture. Throughout the dynasties, articles, poems, songs, and novels have continuously had wonderful narrations and descriptions, expressing the beauty of architecture or its closeness to our lives. Many immortal literary works were specially created to praise or commemorate the greatness of our architecture.
    Recently, in the lens of "Liberated China," there are many awe-inspiring, proud, and pleasing buildings, which are so brilliant and splendidly combined with our great natural environment, representing our history, our art, and the glorious culture of our motherland. We love our motherland, and we cannot help but be excited, inspired, and encouraged by them.
    However, it is not enough for us to blindly love our cultural traditions and heritage. We must further understand it. The names of many of our great craftsmen in the era of oppression have not been remembered, and the structural engineering is not detailed in written records. We must now clarify the achievements of our architecture in engineering and art, its development, its advantages, and the reasons for its success, to enrich our understanding of the culture of our motherland. We must also understand how to value and cherish the excellent traditions of our architecture to promote our future new creations that inherit Chinese blood.
            Our Ancestors' Cave Dwellings
    Our great ancestors in the era when Chinese culture first dawned were "cave dwellers." They used the topography and thermal insulation properties of the soil to create caves as places to live. This method was not completely abandoned in the later process of cultural progress, and it was continuously improved. From the Zhoukoudian cave discovered by archaeologists, the bag-shaped caves in Anyang, ... to the prevalent cave dwellings in North China and Northwest China today, all are examples of cave dwellings that have progressed to different levels. Brick-built cave dwellings are already very mature architectural projects.
            Our Ancestors Created the Frame Structure Method – A Great Tradition
    In places where the terrain, geology, and climate are less suitable for cave dwellings, our wise ancestors used natural materials very early – mainly wood, earth, and stone – with slight processing and production, to construct the earliest houses. The basic principles of this structure were probably formed no later than 1400-1500 BC and are still used today. The Book of Poetry and the Book of Changes both mention such houses, which played the role of sheltering from wind and rain. Ancient writing revealed that predecessors especially expressed satisfaction with the shape of the roof like bird wings spreading out, using sentences such as "making temples wing-like" and "like birds flying, like pheasants soaring" to describe the beauty of the roof. Even the later sayings of "flying eaves" and "flying rafters" also indicated the impression of the tile part being "wing-like," giving us the feeling of "admiring the buildings and yearning." Secondly, many of the early writings mentioned wooden structural parts, mostly to support beams and roofs.
    This frame structure roughly means: first, build a platform with earth on the ground; place stone foundations on the platform, and erect wooden pillars; place beams on the pillars, and connect the beams with purlins; then place rafters on the purlins to create a skeleton, just like an animal has a skeleton, to support the weight above. On top of this frame, the main weight is the roof and tiled eaves, and sometimes upper floors and railings are added. The weight of the upper part of the house is completely borne by the frame, and the walls are only used for separation. This makes the doors and windows absolutely free, and their size and presence can be flexibly handled. Therefore, the same frame can be made open on all sides to form a pavilion, or it can be built with walls as a tightly covered warehouse. The doors, windows, walls, and internal partitions of ordinary houses and halls can all be determined according to their special needs.
    From the Yin Ruins tomb palace ruins excavated in Anyang to the Tiananmen Gate, the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and thousands of temples, residences, and farmhouses today, basically this frame structure method is used. Because this structural method can flexibly adapt to various uses, from Vietnam in the south to Heilongjiang in the north, Xinjiang in the west, and Korea and Japan in the east, wherever Chinese culture reaches, this architectural system can meet the various needs of the people in each place under extremely different climates. This frame structure method provides a suitable foundation and favorable conditions for China's future use of steel frames or reinforced concrete structures. We know that the architecture of the European classical system adopts a stone-stacking system. The safety of the walls limited the area of the windows, and the wideness of the windows would weaken the solidity of the load-bearing walls. Only when steel frames and reinforced concrete were applied was this basic contradiction unified, and the difficulty of opening windows was completely overcome. The part and position of the windows in our architecture have always been the same as those required in modern times, because the frame structure has long had flexible conditions.
            Chinese Architecture Has Formulated Its Own Unique "Grammar"
    The architecture of a nation or cultural system, like language, has its own special "grammar" and "vocabulary." Once they are formed, they become the guidelines of methods accepted and followed by everyone. This is the case in language, and it is also the case in architecture. According to immature research, the "grammar" and "vocabulary" of Chinese architecture were formed through such brewing and development.
    After choosing wood, our ancestors gradually understood its characteristics and created the preliminary method of frame structure – the "beam frame" of the Chinese system. After this, experience also made them discover the weaknesses of wood in terms of performance. That is, when the horizontal beams transfer weight to the vertical pillars, extremely strong shear force will occur at the junction, and the beams are prone to breaking there. Therefore, they used a buffering structure to correct this avoidable danger. They used many "斗" (dou, bucket-shaped wooden blocks) and "拱" (gong, arm-shaped short wood) in the shape of buckets, stacking them heavily on the column heads, with the upper layer of arches longer and longer, supporting the beams above, and concentrating their weight layer by layer to the column heads. This structure in the transition part between beams and pillars reduced the shear force and eliminated the crisis of beam breakage. This combination of dou and gong is called "斗拱" (dougong, bracket set) in modern times. As seen in ancient writing, such as 栌 (lu) and 栾 (luan), although we cannot completely point out which type of dougong they were in the early stage, judging from the descriptive terms and sentences, and the pictures on ancient bronzes, this method of structural combination was largely established early on. So it is said to be a kind of "grammar." And 斗 (dou), 拱 (gong), 梁 (liang, beam), 枋 (fang, purlin), 椽 (chuan, rafter), 檩 (lin, ridgepole), 楹柱 (yingzhu, pillar), 棂窗 (lingchuang, lattice window), etc., are also our main "vocabulary."
    No later than the Spring and Autumn Period, dougong were widely used. It can not only support beams and purlins, but also support eaves, and increase the width of the eaves protruding outward. Mencius has the sentence "榱题数尺" (cuī tí shù chǐ), meaning that the eaves protrude far. This structure has also become an extremely beautiful decoration between the beams and under the eaves, which is also unquestionable from the continuous description of it in ancient writing. For physical objects before the Tang Dynasty, the wooden structures on Han Dynasty stone towers and cliff tombs are the most reliable research materials. There are still wooden buildings from the Tang Dynasty preserved to this day, but the main ones still have to borrow images from paintings. It is possible that before the Tang Dynasty, each part of the dougong itself had standardized proportions, but it was not until the Song Dynasty that we were certain of the various standard regulations of the dougong structure. The proportional scale of countless constituent materials in the entire building is calculated based on the width of an arch as a unit of measurement, and by multiples or fractions of it. During the Song Dynasty, the methods of each component, the degree to which natural materials were trimmed and processed into curves, and how mortise and tenon joints were connected were all standardized, forming rules similar to grammar. As for using it on physical objects, it is ever-changing, and it is rare to see two identical structures. Startling examples, such as the three-story pavilion of the Guanyin Pavilion of Dule Temple in Jixian County, and the structure of the Yingxian Wooden Pagoda, which is twenty zhang high, are both wooden structures that are nearly a thousand years old, which will be described in the following architectural relics.
    In this "grammar," various "vocabulary" change with the times, and the "grammar" is also slightly modified, thus determining the characteristics of each era. But basically, Chinese architecture, like Chinese language and writing, is passed down through generations, continuously evolving, reflecting various influences, and absorbing nourishment, without ever being interrupted.
    The internal dougong beam frame and the dougong organization on the upper part of the eaves pillars are the essence of Chinese architectural engineering. Only by observing and analyzing their function and changes can we truly recognize how great our ancestors' achievements were in mastering the performance of materials and the function of structures. As for building simple houses, most working people can erect pillars and beams; the technology is even more widespread due to the simplification of standardization. Beam frames and dougong are unique features of Chinese architecture, and in the craftsman's manuals, this part is called "大木作做法" (dàmù zuò zuòfǎ, major carpentry techniques).
    The "grammar" of Chinese architecture also includes aspects of brick and stone, walls, doors and windows, oil painting, roof tiles, etc. These are called "石作做法" (shí zuò zuòfǎ, stonework techniques), "小木作做法" (xiǎomù zuò zuòfǎ, minor carpentry techniques), "彩画作做法" (cǎihuà zuò zuòfǎ, painting techniques), and "瓦作做法" (wǎ zuò zuòfǎ, roofing techniques).
    The roof belongs to "瓦作做法" (wǎ zuò zuòfǎ, roofing techniques), and it is the most prominent, most important, and incomparably beautiful part of Chinese architecture. However, the curved surface of the tiled slope, the wing-like upturned corners of the eaves, the "flying rafters" in front of the eaves, and the dougong that support the eaves give Chinese architecture a special style and an unparalleled outstanding posture, which are all due to the wooden structure inside, and are the great achievements of our carpenters. Because the curved surface of the slope and the curve of the eaves are gradually built up and raised due to the "举架法" (jǔjià fǎ, raising frame method) in the structure, not due to artificial manipulation or distortion of the wood. Each type of tile on the roof has its own task, and some are structurally necessary parts that are slightly processed and simultaneously become beautiful tile decorations, such as the ridge tile, ridge kiss, hip ridge, and ridge beast.
    Oil painting was originally used to protect wood. In this regard, Chinese craftsmen fully demonstrated their creativity. They dared to use various colors to create gorgeous and complex colored paintings on beams and purlins, but mainly used "cold colors" belonging to the blue-green system and used gold as an embellishment, the so-called "青绿点金" (qīnglǜ diǎnjīn, blue-green with gold accents), in various formats. Pillars and doors and windows were restricted to using only pure vermilion or black paint, so that the directly lit surface of the building and the colorful beams, purlins, and dougong in the shadows under the eaves had more contrasting effects, strengthening the artistic effect under the eaves. The colored painting system fully demonstrates the ingenuity of our craftsmen in using colors.
    Similarly, the practices of other doors and windows, that is, the "小木作" (xiǎomù zuò, minor carpentry) part, and the walls and bases, the "石作" (shí zuò, stonework) part, have also developed strict regulations and endless variations due to accumulated experience, such as the carving of doors and windows, and the carving of stone seats. Each aspect has special achievements. Although there are unavoidable shortcomings in the project, the overall combination of a Chinese building is undoubtedly a highly successful art.
    As for the combination between buildings, that is, the treatment of space, our ancestors showed unparalleled wisdom. Our plane deployment is unmatched by any other architecture. Courtyard organization is our characteristic on the plane. Whether it is a residence, government office, temple, palace, shop, or workshop, it is composed of several main buildings, such as halls and buildings, and attached buildings, such as side rooms, corridors, courtyard gates, and surrounding walls, which are connected to form a courtyard, or several connected courtyards. This courtyard actually organizes part of the outdoor space into the architectural scope. This adapts to the residents' natural requirements for sunlight, air, flowers, and trees, provides more aspects of use in life, and increases the liveliness and function of the building. A single, huge building divides the space inside for use. No matter how many corridors and chambers there are, the inside of the building is isolated and sharply divided from the outside of the building. Those outside feel isolated from the inside, desirable but unattainable, and those inside feel imprisoned, wanting to go out but unable to, making life somewhat unnatural. It was not until recently that European and American architects paid attention to this shortcoming and emphasized the new concept of connecting the inside and outside. For thousands of years, whether rich or poor, houses in villages or cities have all been composed of courtyards. They naturally give us a lot of pleasure in life, and we sometimes do not realize it in our habits. Similarly, in terms of urban deployment, the space treatment in our motherland is different from the European system, mainly in the application of this courtyard. Today, it is very natural for us to turn the courtyards in front of government offices or temples in many towns into squares. The yard in front of public buildings can become a protected lawn area, which is also in line with modern needs.
    Our architecture has various excellent traditions. We must deeply understand these and humbly learn from the past. We must consolidate the advantages of our traditions, carry them forward, and apply them flexibly in future creations, basically preserving our characteristics. Especially after decades of cultural aggression by imperialism, we may have some estrangement from cultural traditions. Today, we must observe and recognize more to experience and enjoy the special glorious fruits of our motherland's culture more richly.
            Wooden Masterpieces Standing for Thousands of Years
    For thousands of years, most of the architecture of the Chinese nation has been wooden. However, due to metabolism, it is now difficult to see complete architectural complexes from the Tang and Song dynasties, and most of what we see are single buildings that remain.
    Although there are still many wooden buildings in China that are more than 500 years old; only thirty or forty places that are more than seven or eight hundred years old have been investigated and studied by architectural historians; except for the corridors and eaves of the Dunhuang Grottoes, there are only two places in North China that are still intact and healthy for about a thousand years. Here, we must first mention the oldest hall among the existing wooden structures.
    Foguang Temple in Mount Wutai  The main hall of Foguang Temple in Doucun Town, Mount Wutai, Shanxi Province, was rebuilt in 857 AD after the destruction of Buddhism during the Huichang period at the end of the Tang Dynasty. It is the oldest existing wooden structure in China. According to the terrain, it stands on a high platform built against the hillside. The column heads have huge dougong, which pick up the eaves outside and support the beam frame inside, fully demonstrating the characteristics of Chinese architecture. It has stood for 1,100 years and is still as complete as ever, proving how scientific and reasonable its structural engineering is, and how precious this building is. There are inscriptions from the time of construction under the beams in the hall, and a small piece of the original murals is still preserved on the walls. All thirty-odd Buddha statues in the hall are the most typical and excellent works of the late Tang Dynasty. In this hall, the four arts of architecture, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture of the Tang Dynasty are preserved at the same time, and the essence is gathered, which is the most important and precious national treasure among cultural relics. There are also two exquisite realistic clay portraits in the hall, one is Ning Gongyu, the female benefactor who funded the construction of the hall, and the other is the Venerable Yuancheng, who was responsible for rebuilding Foguang Temple at that time. The facial expressions are full of realism and are excellent materials for studying the clothing of the late Tang Dynasty. There is a stone pillar in front of the hall steps, engraved with the year of the hall's construction, and the carvings are also very beautiful.
    Dule Temple in Jixian County  The oldest wooden buildings second only to Foguang Temple are the mountain gate and Guanyin Pavilion of Dule Temple in Jixian County, Hebei Province. The architectural complex built in 984 AD still has these gates and pavilions standing opposite each other, nearly a thousand years now. The mountain gate is a smart, single-story small building, while the Guanyin Pavilion is a huge multi-story (actually three stories, including the "pingzuo" (平坐) layer between the two main floors) large pavilion. Inside the pavilion stands a clay statue of the Eleven-Faced Guanyin Bodhisattva, more than six zhang high, which is the largest clay statue in China and the most typical and excellent sculpture of the Liao Dynasty. The pavilion is built around the statue. A "well" is left in the middle, with the pingzuo layer reaching the statue's knees, the upper layer level with the statue's chest, and the "flower crown" on the statue's head touching the octagonal caisson above. To meet this special need, the ingenious craftsmen left this "well" in the center of the pavilion, allowing the statue's body to pass through three floors; therefore, the structure of this pavilion, up and down, inside and out, used more than a dozen different dougong in different positions according to different structural needs. The structure shows a high degree of "organic nature," causing later architects to only be amazed and stunned when they see it. The whole pavilion is majestic and imposing, with double eaves sloping and stretching, and the eaves protruding extremely far. The impression it presents is different from any other pavilions in China.
    Yingxian Wooden Pagoda  The next wooden masterpiece to be mentioned is the wooden pagoda of Fogong Temple in Yingxian County, Chahar. On the plains of the Sanggan River, ten miles away from the county seat of Yingxian County, you can see the majestic wooden pagoda in the city. The pagoda was built in 1056 AD, and it has been nearly 900 years now. This octagonal five-story (actually nine stories, including the pingzuo layer) pagoda is entirely constructed with a wooden skeleton, and the total height, including the iron brake on the top, is more than 66 meters, a full twenty zhang. A total of 57 different dougong are used up and down, inside and out, to suit different structural needs. Before the Tang Dynasty, many pagodas were wooden, but the incense of Buddhism often destroyed them, so they were later mostly changed to brick and stone. Today, the Yingxian Wooden Pagoda has become the only isolated example in China. From this isolated example, we see the Chinese craftsmen's supremely high level of technology in using wood, which deserves our eternal admiration. A Ming Dynasty plaque on the pagoda praises it with the four characters "鬼斧神工" (guǐ fǔ shén gōng, ghostly workmanship), and we feel the same way after seeing it.
                                                (To be continued)

　　我国伟大的建筑传统与遗产
　　梁思成
            世界上最古，最长寿，最有新生力的建筑体系
    历史上每一个民族的文化都产生了它自己的建筑，随着这文化而兴盛衰亡。世界上现存的文化中，除去我们的邻邦印度的文化可算是约略同时诞生的弟兄外，中华民族的文化是最古老，最长寿的。我们的建筑也同样是最古老，最长寿的体系。在历史上，其他与中华文化约略同时，或先或后形成的文化，如埃及，巴比伦，稍后一点的古波斯，古希腊，及更晚的古罗马，都已成为历史陈迹。而我们的中华文化则血脉相承，蓬勃地滋长发展，四千余年，一气呵成。到了今天，我们所承继的是一份极丰富的遗产，而我们的新生力量正在发育兴盛。我们在这文化建设高潮的前夕，好好再认识一下这伟大光辉的建筑传统是必要的。
    我们自古以来就不断的建造，起初是为了解决我们的住宿，工作，休息与行路所需要的空间，解决风雨寒暑对我们的压迫；便利我们日常生活和生产劳动。但在有了高度文化的时代，建筑便担任了精神上，物质上更多方面的任务。我们祖国的人民是在我们自己所创造出来的建筑环境里生长起来的。我们会意识的或潜意识的爱我们建筑的传统型类以及它们和我们数千年来生活相结合的社会意义，如我们的街市，民居，村镇，院落，市楼，桥梁，庙宇，寺塔，城垣，钟楼等等都是。我们也会意识的或直觉的爱我们的建筑客观上的造形艺术价值；如它们的壮丽或它们的朴实，它们的工艺与大胆的结构，或它们的亲切部署与简单的秩序。它们是我们民族经过代代相承，在劳动的实践中和实际使用相结合而成熟，而提高的传统。它是一个伟大民族的工匠和人民在生活实践中集体的创造。
    因此，我们家乡的一角城楼，几处院落，一座牌坊，一条街市，一列店铺，以及我们近郊的桥，山前的塔，村中的古坟石碑，村里的短墙与三五茅屋，对于我们都是那么可爱，那么有意义的。它们都曾丰富过我们的生活和思想，成为与我们不可分离的情感的内容。
    我们中华民族的人民从古以来就不断地热爱着我们的建筑。历代的文章诗赋和歌谣小说里都不断有精彩的叙述与描写，表示建筑的美丽或它同我们生活的密切。有许多不朽的文学作品更是特地为了颂扬或纪念我们建筑的伟大而作的。
    最近在《解放了的中国》的镜头中，就有许多令人肃然起敬，令人骄傲，令人看着就愉快的建筑，那样光辉灿烂的同我国伟大的天然环境结合在一起，代表着我们的历史，我们的艺术，我们祖国光荣的文化。我们热爱我们的祖国，我们就不可能不被它们所激动，所启发，所鼓励。
    但我们光是盲目地爱我们的文化传统与遗产，还是不够的。我们还要进一步的认识它。我们的许多伟大的匠工在被压迫的时代里，名字已不被人记着，结构工程也不详于文字记载。我们现在必须搞清楚我们建筑在工程和艺术方面的成就，它的发展，它的优点与成功的原因，来丰富我们对祖国文化的认识。我们更要懂得怎样去重视和爱护我们建筑的优良传统，以促进我们今后承继中国血统的新创造。
            我们祖先的穴居
    我们伟大的祖先在中华文化初放曙光的时代是“穴居”的。他们利用地形和土质的隔热性能，开出洞穴作为居住的地方。这方法，就在后来文化进步过程中也没有完全舍弃，而且不断地加以改进。从考古家所发现的周口店山洞，安阳的袋形穴，……到今天华北，西北都还普遍的窑洞，都是进步到不同水平的穴居的实例。砖筑的窑洞已是很成熟的建筑工程。
            我们的祖先创造了骨架结构法——一个伟大的传统
    在地形，地质和气候都比较不适宜于穴居的地方，我们智慧的祖先很早就利用天然材料——主要的是木料，土与石——稍微加工制作，构成了最早的房屋。这种结构的基本原则，至迟在公元前一千四五百年间大概就形成了的，一直到今天还沿用着。诗经易经都同样提到这样的屋子，它们起了遮蔽风雨的作用。古文字流露出前人对于屋顶像鸟翼开展的形状特别表示满意，以“作庙翼翼”，“如鸟斯革，如翬斯飞”等句子来形容屋顶的美。一直到后来的“飞甍”“飞檐”的说法也都指示着瓦部“翼翼”的印象，使我们有“瞻栋宇而兴慕”之概。其次，早期文字里提到的很多都是木构部分，大部都是为了承托梁栋和屋顶的结构。
    这个骨架结构大致说来就是：先在地上筑土为台；台上安石础，立木柱；柱上安置梁架，梁架和梁架之间以枋将它们牵联，上面架檩，檩上安椽，作成一个骨架，如动物之有骨架一样，以承托上面的重量。在这构架之上，主要的重量是屋顶与瓦檐，有时也加增上层的楼板和栏杆。柱与柱之间则依照实际的需要，安装门窗。屋上部的重量完全由骨架担负，墙壁只作间隔之用。这样使门窗绝对自由，大小有无，都可以灵活处理。所以同样的立这样一个骨架，可以使它四面开敞，做成凉亭之类，也可以垒砌墙壁作为掩蔽周密的仓库之类。而寻常房屋厅堂的门窗墙壁及内部的间隔等，则都可以按其特殊需要而定。
    从安阳发掘出来的殷墟坟宫遗址，一直到今天的天安门，太和殿，以及千千万万的庙宇民居农舍，基本上都是用这种骨架结构方法的。因为这样的结构方法能灵活适应于各种用途，所以南至越南，北至黑龙江，西至新疆，东至朝鲜，日本，凡是中华文化所及的地区，在极端不同的气候之下，这种建筑系统都能满足每个地方人民的各种不同的需要。这骨架结构的方法实为中国将来的采用钢架或钢筋混凝土的建筑具备了适当的基础和有利条件。我们知道，欧洲古典系统的建筑是采取垒石制度的。墙的安全限制了窗的面积，窗的宽大会削弱了负重墙的坚固。到了应用钢架和钢筋混凝土时，这个基本矛盾才告统一，开窗的困难才彻底克服了。我们建筑上历来窗的部分与位置同近代所需要的相同，就是因为骨架结构早就有了灵活的条件。
            中国建筑制定了自己特有的“文法”
    一个民族或文化体系的建筑，如同语言一样，是有它自己的特殊的“文法”与“语汇”的。它们一旦形成，则成为被大家所接受遵守的方法的纲领。在语言中如此，在建筑中也如此。中国建筑的“文法”和“语汇”据不成熟的研究，是经由这样酝酿发展而形成的。
    我们的祖先在选择了木料之后逐渐了解木料的特长，创始了骨架结构初步方法，——中国系统的“梁架”。在这以后，经验使他们也发现了木料性能上的弱点。那就是当水平的梁枋将重量转移到垂直的立柱时，在交接的地方会发生极强的剪力，那里梁就容易折断。于是他们就使用一种缓冲的结构来纠正这种可以避免的危险。他们用许多斗形木块的“斗”和臂形的短木“拱”，在柱头上重而上，愈上一层的拱就愈长，将上面梁枋托住，把它们重量一层层递减的集中到柱头上来。这个梁柱间过度部分的结构减少了剪力，消除了梁折断的危机。这种斗和拱组合而成的组合物，近代叫做“斗拱”。见于古文字中的，如栌，如栾等等，我们虽不能完全指出它们是斗拱初期的那一型类，但由描写的专词与句子，和古铜器上图画看来，这种结构组合的方法早就大体成立。所以说是一种“文法”。而斗，拱，梁，枋，椽，檩，楹柱，棂窗等，也就是我们主要的“语汇”了。
    至迟在春秋时代，斗拱已很普遍地应用，它不惟可以承托梁枋，而且可以承托出檐，可以增加檐向外挑出的宽度。孟子里就有“榱题数尺”之句，意思说檐头出去之远。这种结构同时也成为梁间檐下极美的装饰，由于古文不断的将它描写看来，也是没有问题的。唐以前实物，以汉代石阙，与崖墓上石刻的木构部分为最可靠的研究资料。唐时木建还有保存到今天的，但主要的还要借图画上的形象。可能在唐以前，斗拱本身各部已有标准化的比例尺度，但要到宋代，我们才确实知道斗拱结构各种标准的规定。全座建筑物中无数构成材料的比例尺度就都以一个拱的宽度作度量单位，以它的倍数或分数来计算的。宋时且把每一构材的做法，把天然材料修整加工到什么程度的曲线，榫卯如何衔接等都规格化了，形成类似文法的规矩。至于在实物上运用起来，却是千变万化，少见有两个相同的结构。惊心动魄的例子，如蓟县独乐寺观音阁三层大阁，和高二十丈的应州木塔的结构，都是近于一千年的木构，当在下文建筑遗物中叙述。
    在这“文法”中各种“语汇”因时代而改变，“文法”亦略更动了，因而决定了各时代的特征。但在基本上，中国建筑同中国语言文字一样，是血脉相承，赓续演变，反映各种影响及所吸取养料，从没有中断过的。
    内部斗拱梁架和檐柱上部斗拱组织是中国建筑工程的精华。由观察分析它们的作用和变化，才真真认识我们祖先在掌握材料的性能，结构的功能上有多么伟大的成绩。至于建造简单的民居，劳动人民多会立柱上梁；技术由于规格化的简便更为普遍。梁架和斗拱都是中国建筑所独具的特征，在工匠的术书中将这部分称它做“大木作做法”。
    中国建筑的“文法”中还包括着关于砖石，墙壁，门窗，油饰，屋瓦等方面。称做“石作做法”“小木作做法”“彩画作做法”和“瓦作做法”等。
    屋顶属于“瓦作做法”，它是中国建筑中最显著，最重要，庄严无比美丽无比的一部分。但瓦坡的曲面，翼状翘起的檐角，檐前部的“飞椽”，和承托出檐的斗拱，给予中国建筑以特殊风格，和无可比拟的杰出姿态的，都是内中木构所使然，是我们木工的绝大功绩。因为坡的曲面，和檐的曲线，都是由于结构中的“举架法”的逐渐垒进升高而成，不是由于矫揉造作，或歪曲木料而来。盖顶的瓦，每一种都有它的任务，有一些是结构上必需部分而略加处理，便同时成为优美的瓦饰。如瓦脊，脊吻，垂脊，脊兽等。
    油饰本是为保护木材而用的。在这方面中国工匠充分的表现出创造性。他们敢于使用各种颜色在梁枋上作妍丽繁复的彩绘，但主要的却用属于青绿系统的“冷色”而以金为点缀，所谓“青绿点金”，各种格式。柱和门窗则限制到只用纯色的朱红或黑色的漆料，这样建筑物直接受光面同檐下阴影中彩绘斑烂的梁枋斗拱更多了反衬的作用，加强了檐下的艺术效果。彩画制度充分地表现了我们匠师使用颜色的聪明。
    其他门窗即“小木作”部分墙壁台基“石作”部分的做法也一样由于积垒的经验有了谨严的规制，也有无穷的变化。如门窗的刻镂，石座的雕饰。各个方面都有特殊的成就。工程上虽也有不可免的缺点，但中国一座建筑物的整体组合，绝无问题的，是高度成功的艺术。
    至于建筑物同建筑物间的组合，即对于空间的处理，我们的祖先更是表现了无比的智慧。我们的平面部署是任何其他建筑所不可及的。院落组织是我们在平面上的特征。无论是住宅、官署、寺院、宫庭、商店、作坊，都是由若干主要建筑物，如殿堂、厅舍，加以附属建筑物，如厢耳，廊庑，院门，围墙等周绕联络而成一院，或若干相连的院落。这种庭院，事实上，是将一部分户外空间组织到建筑范围以内。这样便适应了居住者对于阳光，空气，花木的自然要求，供给生活上更多方面的使用，增加了建筑的活泼和功能。一座单座庞大的建筑物将它内中的空间分划使用，无论是如何的周廊复室，建筑物以内同建筑物以外是隔绝的，断然划分的。在外的觉得同内中隔绝，可望而不可即，在内的觉得像被囚禁，欲出而不得出，使生活有某种程度的不自然。直到最近欧美建筑师才注意这个缺点，才强调内外联系打成一片的新观点。我们数千年来则无论贫富，在村镇或城市的房屋没有不是组成院落的。它们很自然的给了我们生活许多的愉快，而我们在习惯中，有时反不会觉察到。一样在一个城市部署方面，我们祖国的空间处理同欧洲系统的不同，主要也是在这种庭院的应用上。今天我们把许多市镇中衙署或寺观前的庭院改成广场是很自然的。公共建筑物前面的院子，就可以成护卫的草地区，也很合乎近代需要。
    我们的建筑有着种种优良的传统，我们对于这些要深深理解，向过去虚心学习。我们要巩固我们传统的优点，加以发扬光大，在将来创造中灵活运用，基本保存我们的特征。尤其是在被帝国主义文化侵略数十年之后，我们对文化传统或有些隔膜，今天必需多观摩认识，才会更丰富的体验到，享受到我们祖国文化的特殊的光荣的果实。
            千年屹立的木构杰作
    几千年来，中华民族的建筑绝大部分是木构的。但因新陈代谢，现在已很难看到唐宋时代完整的建筑群，所见大多是硕果仅存的单座建筑物。
    国内现存五百年以上的木构建筑虽还不少；七八百年以上，已经为建筑史家所调查研究过的只有三四十处；千年左右的，除去敦煌石窟的廊檐外，在华北的仅有两处依然完整的健在。我们在这里要首先提到现存木构中最古的一个殿。
    五台佛光寺  山西五台山豆村镇佛光寺的大殿是唐末会昌年间毁灭佛法以后，在八五七年重建的。它已是中国现存最古的木构。它依据地形，屹立在靠山坡筑成的高台上。柱头上有雄大的斗拱，在外面挑着屋檐，在内部承托梁架，充分地发挥了中国建筑的特长。它屹立一千一百年，至今完整如初，证明了它的结构工程是如何科学的，合理的，这个建筑如何的珍贵。殿内梁下还有建造时的题字，墙上还保存着一小片原来的壁画，殿内全部三十几尊佛像都是唐末最典型最优秀的作品。在这一座殿中，同时保存着唐代的建筑，书法，绘画，雕塑四种艺术，精华汇粹，实是文物建筑中最重要，最可珍贵的一件国宝。殿内还有两尊精美的泥塑写实肖像，一尊是出资建殿的女施主宁公遇，一尊是当时负责重建佛光寺的愿诚法师，脸部表情富于写实性，且是研究唐末服装的绝好资料。殿阶前有石幢，刻着建殿年月，雕刻也很秀美。
    蓟县独乐寺  次于佛光寺最古的木建筑是河北蓟县独乐寺的山门和观音阁。九八四年建造的建筑群，竟还有这门阁相对屹立，至今将近千年了。山门是一座灵巧的单层小建筑，观音阁却是一座庞大的重层（加上两主层间的“平坐”层，实际上是三层）大阁。阁内立着一尊六丈余高的泥塑十一面观音菩萨立像，是中国最大的泥塑像，是最典型的优秀辽代雕塑。阁是围绕着像建造的。中间留出一个“井”，平坐层达到像膝，上层与像胸平，像头上的“花冠”却顶到上面的八角藻井下。为满足这特殊需要，天才的匠师在阁的中心留出这个“井”，使像身穿过三层楼；这个阁的结构，上下内外，因此便在不同的地位上，按照不同的结构需要，用了十几种不同的斗拱，结构上表现了高度的“有机性”，令后世的建筑师们看见，只有瞠目咋舌的惊叹。全阁雄伟魁梧，重檐坡斜舒展，出檐极远，所呈印象，与国内其他任何楼阁都不相同。
    应县木塔  再次要提到的木构杰作就是察哈尔应县佛宫寺的木塔。在桑乾河的平原上，离应县县城十几里，就可以望见城内巍峨的木塔。塔建于一○五六年，至今也将近九百年了。这座八角五层（连平座层事实上是九层）的塔，全部用木材骨架构成，连顶上的铁刹，总高六十六公尺余，整整二十丈。上下内外共用了五十七种不同的斗拱，以适合结构上不同的需要。唐代以前的佛塔很多是木构的，但佛家的香火往往把它们毁灭，所以后来多改用砖石。到了今天，应县木塔竟成了国内惟一的孤例。由这一座孤例中，我们看到了中国匠师使用木材登峰造极的技术水平，值得我们永远的景仰。塔上一块明代的匾额，用“鬼斧神工”四个字赞扬它，我们看了也有同感。
