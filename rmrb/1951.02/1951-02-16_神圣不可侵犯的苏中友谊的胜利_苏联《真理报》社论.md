The Victory of the Sacred and Inviolable Soviet-Chinese Friendship
    Soviet Newspaper "Pravda" Editorial

    Today marks the first anniversary of the historical Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, signed on February 14, 1950, in Moscow. At the time of the treaty's signing, agreements were also concluded regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou (Port Arthur), and Dalian (Dairen), as well as an agreement on granting a loan to the People's Republic of China. Prior to the signing of these documents of great importance, negotiations were held between the Soviet Union and China. The negotiations took place in an atmosphere of full mutual understanding and profound friendship. Comrade Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, directly participated in these negotiations.

    The peoples of the Soviet Union and China, and all progressive humanity, joyfully commemorate the first anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The thoughts and feelings of the two great peoples are expressed in the congratulatory telegrams exchanged today between Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong.

    Stalin's telegram to Mao Zedong reads: "Comrade Chairman, please accept sincere congratulations from me on the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino- Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. I am deeply convinced that our treaty will always benefit the friendship between the Soviet Union and China and the consolidation of the cause of peace throughout the world."

    Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's telegram to Stalin reads: "On the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, please accept my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to you, the Soviet government, and the people. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has not only provided great assistance to the construction of the new China, but also provided a strong guarantee for opposing aggression and safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world. I hereby wish further development and consolidation of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!"

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance ushered in a new era in the development of friendly relations between the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union. It marks the beginning of a new stage in the development of international relations, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty has transformed the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union into an immensely powerful force for consolidating world peace, a force unprecedented in the entire history of mankind.

    The friendship between the two great peoples was predetermined by the entire course of historical development. The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution gave the entire imperialist system a crushing blow, aroused the Chinese people to pursue a new life, and opened before them the path of struggle for liberation from the double yoke of imperialists and feudal lords for many years.

    The Soviet people have always followed the Chinese people's struggle for liberation with unwavering and deep sympathy. As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people, said: "…Truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we sympathize now and will sympathize in the future with the Chinese revolution, which is fighting to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unify China into a single state."

    China in the past was tightly bound by the web of unequal treaties imposed by imperialism. The Soviet Union's consistent friendly policy towards China showed the Chinese people that there exists another kind of relationship between peoples - a relationship based on equality and mutual respect. The Soviet Union was the first country to sign a treaty with China on an equal basis. This is how the historical ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China were strengthened.

    The crushing of German fascism and Japanese militarism by the peace-loving peoples (in which the Soviet Union played a decisive role) was a prerequisite for the Chinese people's victory over domestic reactionaries and American interventionists. The victory of the Chinese national liberation movement after the October Revolution is a new and most powerful blow to the entire world imperialist system and all the aggressive plots of imperialism in our time.

    Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its long-tested leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved an epoch-making victory and established the People's Republic of China. The Central People's Government, which leads the People's Republic of China, unites the entire China and pursues a policy of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, has proven its ability to safeguard China's national independence and territorial integrity. It was this government that signed the historic Sino-Soviet Treaty.

    The year since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has shown how surprisingly vital this treaty is as the foundation for the flourishing and continuous development of close friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. This year has demonstrated the treaty's great international significance for the cause of peace. The full significance of this treaty becomes even more prominent at a time when the American and British imperialists are frantically stepping up war preparations.

    All the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty are imbued with the spirit of striving for peace and international peaceful cooperation. Its basic task is to prevent Japan or any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in acts of aggression from re-embarking on aggression.

    It is needless to prove that the revival of Japanese militarism and the establishment of a hotbed of imperialist aggression in Japan would seriously endanger peace in the Far East. But everyone knows that this is precisely the goal that the American imperialists are striving to achieve. They are rebuilding the Japanese army and the Japanese arms industry, supporting Japanese revanchists, and preparing to conclude a separate peace with the Japanese reactionaries in order to obstruct the signing of a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with democratic principles.

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty is precisely the opposite of these illegal actions of the American ruling circles. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China strive to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible together with the other Allies in the Second World War. The treaty clearly states: "The two contracting parties declare that they will participate, in a spirit of faithful cooperation, in all international actions aimed at ensuring peace and security throughout the world and will contribute fully to the rapid achievement of this goal." The close and friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the struggle for peace has been fully implemented in accordance with this provision. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has consistently upheld the rights and interests of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and exposed the conspiracy of the American aggressors against the Chinese people. Everyone also knows that the People's Republic of China has consistently supported all proposals of the Soviet Union aimed at consolidating peace and international security.

    Under the current circumstances, the full and great significance of the cooperation between the Soviet Union and China in the struggle for peace is particularly prominent. American and British imperialism are engaged in a frantic arms race and stepping up preparations for a new world war. The American warmongers have moved from preparing for aggression to open acts of aggression. They have launched a bloody war against the Korean people, seized China's island of Taiwan, dispatched the US Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, and are conducting robber-style air raids on Chinese territory.

    The foreign policy line adopted by the American ruling circles clearly shows that American imperialism hopes to further expand aggression in the Far East, first and foremost against the Chinese people. The clearest proof of this is the shameful resolution against the People's Republic of China forced through the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly by the United States with the help of its notorious "voting machine." Similarly, the American imperialists' active assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor of the Chinese people, and the American interventionists' violent interference in the internal affairs of Vietnam and other nations in Asia also prove the above point.

    The struggle of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China for peace has shattered the plans of the imperialist aggressors. The strength of the peace camp is growing and its scope is expanding. Hatred for the American warmongers is constantly growing among peace-loving people. The struggle in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly over the shameful resolution proposed by the American interventionists shows that the People's Republic of China enjoys the sympathy of all peace-loving people, especially the people of Asian countries.

    In the past year, there has been real progress in economic and cultural cooperation between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

    The Soviet Union has transferred all the former barracks property in Beijing to China. In Northeast China and Dalian, the Soviet Union has transferred many industrial enterprises and cultural and educational institutions to the Chinese government. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union has delivered to China valuable equipment worth many millions of rubles for factories, manufacturing plants and power stations, locomotives and carriages and rails for restoring railways, tractors and combines and other agricultural machinery for restoring Chinese agriculture, and extremely important raw materials and materials to ensure the smooth development of China's recovering industry. The Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies, operating on the principle of full equality and mutual benefit, have achieved remarkable results.

    The selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union is an important factor in the restoration of Chinese industry and the entire national economy. With the help and support of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, drawing on the rich experience of the Soviet Union, have made great achievements in restoring and developing their national economy. The industrial production plan for 1950 has been exceeded. The People's Government constantly cares about improving the material well-being of the working people. Following the example of the Soviet Union, the Chinese working people are increasingly widely engaged in production competitions. New management talents are emerging from among workers and peasants.

    Recently, some Chinese delegations visited the Soviet Union, and many Soviet representatives visited China. This friendly exchange of representatives between the two peoples helped the Chinese people to understand the advanced Soviet culture. The Soviet people have also had the opportunity to understand the great Chinese people's outstanding and distinctive creative work. Soviet and Chinese filmmakers have worked together to produce excellent documentary films about China. Soviet films, books and works of art are widely welcomed in China, just as the first Chinese films and works by Chinese writers have become widely known in the Soviet Union.

    The first year of the Sino-Soviet Treaty has shown that it is of great significance for the promotion and consolidation of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and for the cause of peace and security in all countries of the world.

    For the benefit of the people of these two great countries, for the sake of world peace, may the fraternal alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China flourish and last forever!

　　神圣不可侵犯的苏中友谊的胜利
    苏联《真理报》社论
    今天是苏联与中华人民共和国于一九五○年二月十四日在莫斯科签订的历史性的友好同盟互助条约的一周年纪念日。在缔约之时曾同时缔结了关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定以及关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定。在签订这些具有极大重要性的文件之前，苏联与中国曾进行了谈判。谈判是在充分的相互谅解与深切的友好气氛之中进行的。苏联部长会议主席斯大林及中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东直接参加了这次谈判。
    苏、中两国人民和一切进步人类都欢欣鼓舞地纪念中苏条约的一周年。苏、中两国伟大人民的思想与感情表现在今天发表的斯大林同志与毛泽东同志的贺电之中。
    斯大林致毛泽东的贺电称：“值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年之际，主席同志，请接受我衷心的祝贺。我深信我们的条约将始终有利于中苏两国间的友谊和全世界和平事业的巩固。”
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席致斯大林的贺电称：“值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年之际，请接受我对阁下、苏联政府与人民的衷心感谢与祝贺。中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，不但对新中国的建设有了极大的帮助，而且在反对侵略、维护远东及世界和平与安全上提供了强有力的保证。谨此，祝中苏两国的友好合作更进一步的发展与巩固！”
    中苏友好同盟互助条约揭开了中苏两国伟大人民友好关系发展的新纪元。它标志着国际关系发展的新阶段的开端，因为中苏条约把中苏两国人民之间的友谊变成了巩固世界和平的强大无比的力量，整个人类历史上空前未有的力量。
    两国伟大人民的友谊是整个历史发展过程所预先决定的。伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利给了整个帝国主义体系以粉碎性的打击，唤起了中国人民去追求新的生活，并且在他们面前展开了从帝国主义者和封建主多年的双重桎梏下争取解放的斗争道路。
    苏联人民怀着始终不易的深切同情注意中国人民的解放斗争。早在一九二五年，苏联人民的领袖斯大林同志就说过：“………真理和正义完全是在中国革命方面。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命，它正在为了把中国人民从帝国主义羁绊下解放出来并且为了把中国统一成为一个国家而斗争着。”
    中国过去被帝国主义不平等条约的罗网紧紧地束缚着。苏联对中国始终不渝的友好政策向中国人民表明了：在各国人民之间存在着另一种关系——以平等与互相尊重为基础的关系。苏联是第一个在平等的基础上与中国签订条约的国家。苏中两国人民之间的历史的联系就是这样增强起来的。
    爱好和平的各国人民的击溃德国法西斯主义与日本军国主义（苏联在其中起了决定性的作用），是中国人民战胜国内反动派与美国干涉者的先决条件。在十月革命之后，中国民族解放运动的胜利是我们这一时代中对整个世界帝国主义体系及帝国主义一切侵略阴谋的新的最有力的打击。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导下，已经取得了划时代的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。领导中华人民共和国的中央人民政府，团结了整个中国并奉行着对苏联友好合作的政策，已经证明了它能够维护中国的国家独立与领土完整。正是这个政府签订了历史性的中苏条约。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一年来已表现出：这个条约具有多么惊人的、作为苏联与中华人民共和国之间的密切友谊繁荣滋长与不断发展的基础的生命力。这一年显示了这个条约对和平事业的重大国际意义。在美、英帝国主义者正疯狂地加紧战争准备之时，这一条约的全部重大意义就更为有力地突现出来了。
    中苏条约所有的条款都贯穿着为和平与国际和平合作而奋斗的精神。它的基本任务便是不许日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家重新进行侵略。
    无需证明，复活日本军国主义、在日本建立帝国主义侵略的温床，就会严重危及远东和平。可是大家都很知道，这正是美帝国主义者力求达到的目标，他们正在重建日本军队及日本军火工业、支持日本的复仇主义者并且准备与日本反动派单独媾和，以阻挠依照民主的原则签订对日和约。
    中苏条约与美国统治集团的这些非法行动是恰恰相反的。苏联与中华人民共和国力求尽早与第二次世界大战中的其他盟国一起缔结对日和约。条约中说得明白：缔约国双方宣布愿以忠诚的合作的精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量。苏联和中华人民共和国过去曾经而且现在还在积极参加各国人民争取和平、反对帝国主义新战争挑拨者的斗争。条约中有一条规定：“缔约国双方根据巩固和平与普遍安全的利益均将进行彼此协商。”两国在争取和平的斗争中紧密的友好合作已完全按照这一项条款实现了。大家知道：苏联过去曾经而且现在仍然坚持不渝地维护中华人民共和国在联合国中的权益，它揭露美国侵略者对中国人民的阴谋。大家也都知道：中华人民共和国过去曾经而且现在仍然坚持不渝地支持苏联一切旨在巩固和平与国际安全的建议。
    在最近的形势下，苏中两国在争取和平的斗争中协力合作的全部伟大意义显得特别突出。美英帝国主义进行着疯狂的军备竞赛，并且加紧准备新的世界战争。美国战争贩子已从准备侵略进到公开的侵略行为。他们对朝鲜人民发动了血腥战争，夺取了中国的岛屿台湾，派遣美国第七舰队到台湾海峡，并且正在对中国领土进行强盗式的空中袭击。
    美国统治集团所采取的外交政策方针，清楚地说明美帝国主义指望进一步在远东扩大侵略，首先是侵略中国人民。关于这一点，最明白的证据就是美国借助其臭名远扬的“表决机器”强使联合国大会政治委员会通过的反动中华人民共和国的可耻决议。同样，美帝国主义者积极地援助中国人民的叛徒蒋介石，以及美国干涉者强暴地干涉越南及亚洲其他民族的内部事务也证明了上述一点。
    苏中两国人民争取和平的斗争，打破了帝国主义侵略者的计划。和平阵线的力量日益增长，其范围也日益扩大。对美国战争贩子的仇恨，在爱好和平的人民中间不断地增强着。在联合国大会政治委员会内，围绕着美国干涉者所提出的可耻决议开展的斗争表明：中华人民共和国得到一切爱好和平的人民的同情，首先是亚洲各国人民的同情。
    在过去一年中，苏中两国伟大人民之间的经济和文化合作表现了真正的进展。
    苏联已将从前在北京的全部兵营的房产移交给中国。在东北和大连，苏联已将许多工业企业和文化教育机关移交给中国政府。自从中苏条约签订以来，苏联已经运交给中国价值许多百万卢布的用于工厂和制造厂与动力站的贵重设备，供恢复铁路之用的机车及车皮与铁轨、供复与中国农业之用的拖拉机和联合机及其他农业机器、保证恢复中的中国工业顺利发展的极重要的原料与物资。根据充分平等互利的原则经营的中苏股份公司成绩斐然。
    苏联无私的兄弟般的援助乃是恢复中国工业与整个国民经济的重要因素。中国人民在苏联的帮助与支援之下，吸取苏联的丰富经验，在恢复与发展他们的国民经济方面获得了巨大的成就。一九五○年的工业生产计划已经超过了。人民政府经常关怀提高劳动人民的物质福利。中国劳动人民仿效苏联的榜样，正在日益广泛地展开生产竞赛。新的管理人材正从工人与农民当中涌现出来。
    近来曾有一些中国代表团访问苏联，同时也有许多苏联的代表访问中国。两国人民代表的这种友好的往来帮助了中国人民认识先进的苏联文化。苏联人民同样也得到机会认识伟大的中国人民的卓越而富有特色的创造性的工作。苏中两国的电影工作者协同努力摄制了关于中国的优异的记录影片。苏联的影片、书籍和艺术品在中国受到广大的欢迎，正如第一批中国影片和中国作家的作品在苏联已普遍为人所知一样。
    中苏条约生效的一年表明了它对中苏两国人民之间的友谊和合作的促进和巩固、对全世界一切国家的和平与安全事业是有着巨大的意义的。
    为了这两个伟大国家的人民的利益，为了世界和平的利益，祝苏联和中华人民共和国之间的兄弟般的同盟和友谊发扬光大垂于永久！
