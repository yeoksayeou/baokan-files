　　The State Council of the Central People's Government passed the "Decision on Implementing Monetary Management" on December 1, 1950, and the Central Finance and Economics Committee issued the "Instructions on Implementation Measures for Monetary Management and Compilation Methods for Monetary Revenue and Expenditure Plans" on December 25. This is a significant decision in financial and economic work. The fundamental significance of monetary management is that the Central People's Government designates the National Bank as the agency for settlement, credit, and cash management for state-owned and cooperative economies. The National Bank implements capital management for various military units, government agencies, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives to ensure the execution of the financial budget and final accounts system and the implementation of the enterprise economic accounting system, thereby rationally utilizing national financial resources to consolidate the already stable financial situation and rely on the funds concentrated through the implementation of monetary management to support material exchange, thus promoting the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production.
    Monetary management mainly involves two tasks: first, implementing a transfer and clearing system, with the bank centralizing credit; second, implementing cash management.

　　Implementing transfer and clearing, with the bank centralizing credit, is the main content of monetary management. The so-called bank handling clearing means that the capital supply system and commercial credit of public enterprises must be abolished, and replaced with an independent accounting system for enterprises and a centralized credit system for banks. The purpose is to ensure that all revenue and expenditure pass through the bank, to effectively promote and supervise enterprise economic accounting. The State Council decision stipulates that all transactions between military units, government agencies, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives, whether local, inter-city, or international, shall be cleared through the People's Bank of China. No arrears or loans shall occur between the aforementioned units, and credit shall be centralized in the National Bank. This decision is completely correct because without implementing the transfer and clearing method, the following shortcomings cannot be overcome and prevented: First, enterprise accounting is not independent, capital is uncertain, and each enterprise treats the surrender and allocation of cash and materials as tasks. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate profits and losses, and it is easy to cause capital backlog and waste. Moreover, if only cash passes through the bank for cash and material allocation between higher and lower levels, it is difficult for the bank to understand the entire revenue and expenditure situation of the enterprises concerned, and it is also difficult to supervise the credit that has already been extended. Second, if commercial credit between various departments and enterprises exists, and general enterprises only handle cash clearing through the bank or subsequent balance settlements, and various units implement mutual multilateral material allocation, without centralized clearing by the bank, it is difficult to quickly settle accounts and quickly determine creditor and debtor relationships, which can easily lead to capital stagnation due to arrears. Failure to pay off debts on time, or even disputes, often prevents enterprise leaders from concentrating on enterprise management.
    Only by implementing the transfer and clearing system, with independent enterprise accounting, centralized bank credit, and all cash receipts, payments, and material allocations settled through the bank, with the National Bank becoming the general accounting agency for various military units, government agencies, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives, can the above situation be changed. Because: First, after the capital allocation between higher and lower levels is cleared through the bank, they are both creditor-debtor relationships with the bank. In this way, lower-level units must save on capital use and are unwilling to blindly receive more funds. Second, highly concentrated, rapid, and timely bank clearing can quickly settle accounts and avoid arrears. The material allocation between various units will inevitably develop greatly, thereby enlivening commodity circulation and capital turnover. Third, the National Bank, by controlling credit, can grasp the entire revenue and expenditure situation and capital utilization of each enterprise. If an enterprise has a backlog of funds due to poor product quality and sluggish sales, or a backlog of raw materials due to poor management, resulting in insufficient funds, the bank can make suggestions for improving operations when it requests credit. Only when the enterprise's production and sales situation is normal and operations are reasonable will credit be granted. Due to the three favorable conditions of the bank's institutions being universally deep into various factories and mines, being familiar with enterprise revenue and expenditure, and mastering credit power, it can assist the competent authorities and become a powerful assistant in promoting and supervising enterprise economic accounting.
    Implementing a transfer and clearing system and centralizing credit by the National Bank is an important experience of the Soviet State Bank and the main content of Soviet monetary management. When the Soviet Union began its first Five-Year Plan in 1928, state-owned enterprises all implemented economic accounting systems, striving to increase profit income as an important source of socialist construction funds. Comrade Stalin gave precise instructions on credit reform in 1930, saying: "The rational organization of credit business and the correct use of monetary resources are of great significance to the development of the national economy. The party's approach to solving this problem is along two paths: one path is to concentrate all short-term credit in the National Bank, and the other path is to organize non-cash clearing in the socialized sector. In this way, first, the National Bank is transformed into a national agency for registering production and goods distribution; second, a large amount of currency is freed from the scope of circulation. These measures will (and have) put the entire credit business on the right track and make the ruble more consolidated." (Report at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party). This means that the National Bank should take promoting enterprise economic accounting and ensuring the completion of production plans as its main responsibilities by centralizing and distributing working capital. After the Second World War, during the Soviet Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, the Soviet State Bank made promoting the accelerated turnover of funds and realizing economic accounting its main task.
    In China, the Northeast Administrative Region has preliminary experience in this regard. The Northeast implemented cash management in 1949 and a settlement system in 1950, and has already achieved significant results. The Northeast established the General Accounting Bureau in April 1949 as the center for material allocation and cash distribution during the transition period, which extensively developed transfer and clearing, saving cash usage. In January 1950, it was decided to end this transitional institution and change the National Bank to be the center for settlement credit and cash management, while establishing an independent enterprise accounting system. It is expected that the settlement work of all state-owned enterprises and local enterprises can be completed in 1951. According to existing experience, state-owned enterprises welcome the bank signing contracts for handling settlements.

　　At present, the basic conditions for promoting transfer and clearing and centralizing credit by banks nationwide are already mature. Since the Central People's Government implemented cash management, curbed inflation, and adjusted industry and commerce in 1950, the currency has stabilized, and the production and sales work of various factories and mines has been generally planned to some extent. The capital of industrial and mining factories is largely independent, trade companies have laid the foundation for financial management, and the state has begun to require all enterprises to strive to accelerate capital turnover and implement economic accounting. Subjectively, the National Bank has also laid the foundation for monetary management. However, in terms of implementation steps, based on the characteristics that the state-owned economy in Guannei is not as large as in the Northeast and the relationship is not as close as in the Northeast, the National Bank should first handle the transfer and clearing of central-level enterprises, starting with the trade, transportation, finance, and industrial departments with the widest connections. With the gradual establishment of an independent enterprise accounting system, clearing units can be pushed down level by level, and the clearing network can be gradually expanded. For local enterprises, clearing should be carried out selectively first. After the implementation of transfer and clearing, state-owned enterprises must gradually reach the point of abolishing all commercial credit between higher and lower levels and left and right sides. However, a cautious attitude should be adopted towards commercial credit between public and private entities. At present, small commodity production and private capitalism account for a relatively large proportion. Under the leadership of the state economy, commodity turnover between public and private entities still relies on commercial credit and bank credit. Therefore, the National Bank should have appropriate steps in this regard.

　　Another important aspect of monetary management is to strengthen cash management and master the revenue and expenditure plan. The purpose is to reduce cash usage, promote transfer accounting, and plan the regulation of currency circulation. The State Council decision states that the cash usage of military units, government agencies, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives must be planned for revenue and expenditure and approved by the appropriate authorities.

　　Cash management includes two main links: the first is to concentrate cash in the bank, and the second is to plan cash revenue and expenditure. This means first controlling cash, and then controlling the use of cash. According to the "Decision on Implementing Cash Management for State Agencies" promulgated by the State Council on April 7, 1950, the National Bank basically completed the task of concentrating cash in the bank in 1950. However, the work of planning cash revenue and expenditure was carried out later. The focus of cash management in 1951 should be on mastering revenue and expenditure plans. Because the compilation of revenue and expenditure plans is an important guarantee for stabilizing finance. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union completed the system of compiling and auditing revenue and expenditure plans, which made the currency more stable and prevented the possibility of wartime financial fluctuations. The procedure for implementing cash management by the Northeast People's Government was to complete the work of concentrating cash in the bank in 1949, and then promote revenue and expenditure plans in 1950. At present, the laws of revenue and expenditure in the Northeast region can be largely grasped, and the accuracy of revenue and expenditure plans has generally reached 80%. Therefore, prices in the Northeast were able to withstand repeated tests and remain stable throughout 1950. However, in the country as a whole, some enterprises still lack sufficient understanding of compiling revenue and expenditure plans. They have paid too much attention to the convenience of each unit's use of funds and have not compiled realistic revenue and expenditure plans based on the spirit of tight budgeting and saving funds from the perspective of national interests.
    In the process of promoting monetary management, the relationship between the National Bank and various units will undergo significant changes. The New Democratic National Bank for state-owned enterprises, agencies, groups, and troops, is no longer the relationship of free-flowing customers in capitalist society, as the National Bank has been stipulated by State Council decrees to become the general accounting agency for various military units, government agencies, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives, that is, the state's clearing, credit, and cash management agency. All units must recognize that monetary management is not only capital management conducted by the National Bank on behalf of the state, but also a high level of service provided by the National Bank to various units. It is necessary to learn to use the bank, a highly centralized management agency with organizations all over the country, to manage accounts, money, and usage on its behalf. When the National Bank conducts monetary management, it must adhere to national laws and regulations, and work step by step, especially in the specific work of abolishing commercial credit and mastering revenue and expenditure plans. There cannot be a rush. However, the leading organs in various places should treat the State Council's decision on monetary management as a matter of financial discipline to be obeyed.

　　Monetary management is a central link in the current national financial work. It is not only of great importance to the rational use of national financial resources and the consolidation of financial and price stability, but also can concentrate funds, further enliven the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and support the more rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production. Governments at all levels and the people of the whole country should ensure its realization.

### 实施货币管理的重大意义

　　实施货币管理的重大意义
    中央人民政府政务院于一九五○年十二月一日通过了关于实施货币管理的决定，中央财经委员会又于十二月二十五日颁发关于货币管理实施办法及货币收支计划编制办法的指示，这是财经工作上的重大决定。货币管理的基本意义，是中央人民政府规定以国家银行为国营经济和合作经济的清算、信贷与现金管理的机关。国家银行对于各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社实施资金管理，以保证财政预决算制度的执行，及企业经济核算制度的实施，从而合理地使用国家财力，以巩固已经稳定的金融情况并依靠由实行货币管理所集中起来的资金，以扶助物资交流，从而推动工农业生产的恢复和发展。
    货币管理主要是两项工作：一是实行划拨清算制度，由银行集中信贷。二是实行现金管理。
    实行划拨清算，由银行集中信贷，是货币管理的主要内容。所谓银行办理清算，即必须取消公营企业的资金供给制度及其商业信用，而代以企业独立会计制度与银行集中信贷制度，目的在于保证一切收支通过银行，以有效地推动并监督企业经济核算。政务院决定规定：各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社间在本埠、埠际及国际间的一切交易往来，全部通过中国人民银行划拨清算。上述各单位间，不得发生赊欠和借贷，信贷集中于国家银行。这个决定是完全正确的。因为不实行划拨清算办法，就不能克服和防止下述这样一些缺点：第一，企业会计不独立，资金不确定，各企业对于现金及物资的上缴和下拨，均作为任务来处理，因此很难计算损益，也易造成资金积压与浪费。而且上下级之间的现金与物资调拨，如果仅有现金通过银行，银行也不易了解有关企业全部收支情况，对于已经进行的信贷，也很困难发生监督作用。第二，各部门各企业之间的商业信用如果存在，一般企业如仅通过银行办理现金清算，或事后的差额清偿，各单位之间实行相互的多边的物资调拨，在没有银行集中清算的条件下，帐务很难迅速结清，债权债务不能迅速确定，这就很容易造成由于拖欠而来的资金呆滞现象。债权债务不能准期清偿，甚至发生纠纷，往往使企业负责人不得集中全力于企业经营。
    只有实行了划拨清算制度，企业会计独立，银行集中信贷，现金收付与物资调拨全部通过银行结帐，国家银行成为各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的总的帐务会计机关，才能改变上述的情况。因为：第一，上下级之间的资金调拨，经过银行清算之后，彼此对银行都是债权债务关系，这样，下级单位必须节约资金使用，不愿盲目多领资金。第二，高度集中迅速及时的银行清算，可以使帐目迅速结清，避免拖欠现象，各单位之间的物资划拨必将大量发展，因而活跃了商品流通与资金周转。第三，国家银行掌握了信贷，即可以掌握各企业的全部收付情况和资金运用情况。如果某一企业由于产品质量不佳，销路不畅而积压了资金，或是由于经营不善积压了原料，造成资金不足的现象，银行就可以在它请求信贷时对它提出改善经营的意见，只有到企业的生产和销售情况正常，经营合理的时候，才给予信贷。由于银行机构有普遍深入各厂矿企业、熟悉企业收支、掌握信贷力量这三个有利条件，它就能够协助主管部门，成为推动与监督企业经济核算的有力助手。
    实行划拨清算制度，必须建立企业独立的会计制度。现在各地实行的企业金库制度，应逐步取消。企业金库制度对于财经工作的统一管理，曾经发生过重大作用，因为通过了资金的集中管理，实现了物资的统一调拨，以及经营上的比较统一的计划。但是企业金库制度是资金问题上的供给制度，它妨碍经济核算制的推行。因此除少数必需统一计算损益的企业单位如交通部门，可以保留金库制度外，已设的企业金库应即坚决地逐步地取消。正确的企业管理制度应当是：企业会计独立，资金确定，上级核定其生产经营计划与财务计划，银行监督其执行计划和运用资金并适当解决其资金需求。
    实施划拨清算制度，国家银行集中信贷，是苏联国家银行的重要经验，也是苏联货币管理的主要内容。苏联于一九二八年开始第一次五年建设计划时，国家企业均推行经济核算制度，努力增加利润收入，以作为社会主义建设资金的重要来源。斯大林同志于一九三○年对于信用改革作了精确的指示，他说：“信用业务的合理组织，与货币资源的正确运用，对于国民经济之发展，实有严重意义。党在解决这一问题上所行的办法是循着两个途径的：一个途径是集中全部短期信用于国家银行，一个途径是在社会化部门里组织不用现款的清算。这样，第一，国家银行转变为登记生产与物品分配的全国机关；第二，大批货币从流通范围解脱出来。这些办法将使（它们已使）整个信用业务走上正轨，使卢布益趋巩固。”（在联共党第十六次代表大会上的报告）这就是说，国家银行应以集中与分配流动资金，促进企业经济核算，保证完成生产计划为主要职责。第二次世界大战以后，苏联五年经济建设计划中，苏联国家银行即以促进资金的加速周转，实现经济核算为其主要的工作任务。
    在中国，东北大行政区已初步有了这方面的经验。东北于一九四九年实施现金管理，一九五○年实行结算制度，并已经获得了重大成就。东北于一九四九年四月成立总会计局作为过渡时期的物资调拨及现金调配的中心，曾经广泛发展划拨往来，节省了现金使用。一九五○年一月决定结束这一过渡机构，改由国家银行担任结算信贷与现金管理的中心，同时确立企业独立会计制度。预定于一九五一年可以完成全部国家企业及地方企业的结算工作。根据已有的经验，国家企业是欢迎银行签订办理结算的合同的。
    目前，在全国范围内推行划拨清算、由银行集中信贷的制度的基本条件，已经成熟。从一九五○年中央人民政府实施现金管理，制止通货膨胀，调整工商业以来，通货已经稳定，各厂矿企业的生产销售工作大体上已有些计划，工业厂矿资金大部独立，贸易公司已奠定了财务管理的基础，国家开始要求各企业努力加速资金周转，实施经济核算。就主观条件说国家银行亦已初步奠立了货币管理工作的基础。不过，在实行步骤上，应根据关内公营经济不如东北多，关系不如东北之密的特点，国家银行应首先办理中央一级企业的划拨清算，而且从联结面最广的贸易、交通、财政、工业部门开始。随着企业独立会计制度的逐步建立，清算单位可以逐级下推，清算网逐步扩大。对于地方企业暂先有重点地进行清算。实行划拨清算后，公营企业必须逐渐达到取消上下左右全部的商业信用。但对于公与私之间的商业信用，则应采取审慎的态度。目前小商品生产及私人资本主义经济成份比重较大，在国家经济的领导下，公与私之间的商品周转尚有赖商业信用与银行信用，因之国家银行在这一方面应有妥善的步骤。
    货币管理的另一个重要内容，是加强现金管理，掌握收支计划。其目的在于减少现金使用，推行划拨转帐，有计划地调节货币流通。政务院决定：部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的现金使用，必须编造收支计划，并经适当机关的批准。
    现金管理工作，包括两个主要的环节：第一个环节是现金集中银行，第二个环节是现金收支计划化。这即是首先掌握现金，然后掌握现金的使用。根据一九五○年四月七日政务院颁布的《关于实行国家机关的现金管理的决定》，一九五○年的国家银行工作基本上完成了现金集中银行的任务。但是现金收支计划的工作则进行较迟。一九五一年现金管理工作应以掌握收支计划为中心。因为，收支计划的编制，为稳定金融的重要保证。苏联在第二次世界大战以前，完成了收支计划编制与审核的制度，使货币更加稳定，制止了战时金融波动的可能。东北人民政府实行现金管理的程序是，一九四九年完成现金集中银行的工作，一九五○年则推行了收支计划。目前东北地区收支规律大体已经可以掌握，收支计划的准确性一般已达百分之八十。因此东北物价，一九五○年能够屡经考验，而始终保持稳定。不过，在全国，还有部分企业对于编制收支计划的认识十分不足，他们还过多地照顾了各单位用款方便的利益，而没有从国家利益出发，根据紧打紧用节约资金的精神，编造切合实际的收支计划。
    在推行货币管理过程中，国家银行与各单位的关系，将发生显著的变化。新民主主义的国家银行对于国家企业、机关、团体、部队，已经不是资本主义社会中的自由往来的主顾关系，国家银行已经政务院法令规定成为各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的总的帐务会计机关，亦即是国家的清算、信贷与现金管理机关。各单位必须认清货币管理，既是国家银行代表国家进行的资金管理，同时又是国家银行对于各单位的高度的服务。必须学会运用银行这一高度集中而又组织遍及全国的管理机构，代为管帐，管钱，管用。国家银行进行货币管理时，必须坚持国家法令，同时应有步骤地进行工作，尤其在取消商业信用及掌握收支计划的具体工作上，不能有急性病。但是，各地领导机关对于政务院关于货币管理的决定，应当作为财政纪律来服从。
    货币管理是目前国家财政工作中一个中心环节。它不仅对于合理使用国家财力，巩固金融物价的稳定方面有极重大的关系，而且能集中资金，进一步活泼城乡内外物资的交流，扶助工农业生产的更迅速的恢复和发展。各级政府和全国人民都应当保证其实现。
