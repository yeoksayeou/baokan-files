　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The movement against American imperialism rearming Japan has unfolded in many medium-sized cities and some rural areas. People in more than 20 cities, including Harbin, Jilin, Zhangjiakou, Gui Sui, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Kaifeng, Yangzhou, Fuzhou, Nanning, Yichang, Yan'an, Xining, and Luzhou, have successively held demonstrations against the United States rearming Japan. Participants in the marches included people from all walks of life, all ethnic groups, and different occupations and religious beliefs. The masses who have demonstrated in Harbin included workers, literary and art circles, industrial and commercial circles, women's circles, Hui, Mongolian, Korean and other ethnic groups, as well as Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, Taoists and other religious believers. Women in Fuzhou, Jilin, Yichang, Xinxiang and other cities have held separate demonstrations. More than 20,000 women in Fuzhou participated in the demonstrations, including female workers, female students, female teachers, female medical workers, female artists, female Christians, nuns, female monks, housewives, and farmers from the suburbs. 150,000 people from all walks of life in Jinan held a demonstration rally on February 18. At the meeting, a telegram was sent to warn the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan. More than 500 representatives attending the Shandong Provincial Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers also participated in the parade as a team. 40,000 workers held high the banner of opposing the United States rearming Japan. When the parade passed the "May 3rd" street intersection (this was the street burned down by Japanese bandits during the May 3rd Massacre in 1928), the emotions of the masses became even more激愤, and people who had personally suffered persecution by Japanese bandits took to the streets to accuse the Japanese bandits of their atrocities. Prior to the demonstrations, women's circles, youth circles, industrial and commercial circles, opera circles, and religious circles in the city also held separate meetings, issuing telegrams and statements opposing the United States arming Japan.
    Workers in Qiqihar, Chengdu, and Kunming; women in Fuzhou, Xinxiang, Yichang, Nanning and other cities; family members of martyrs, soldiers and working cadres in Qingdao; Hui people in Kaifeng, Huaiyang, Ningling, Qiqihar and other cities; Christians in Nanning; and industrial and commercial circles in Xining have all signed patriotic pacts in the demonstrations accusing Japanese bandits of their atrocities and opposing the United States rearming Japan. Workers in Zhangjiakou, Wuhu, Shantou and other places also guaranteed to enrich national defense with practical actions and oppose American aggression during the demonstrations. All the representatives of the North Jiangsu Textile Industry Conference, rickshaw pullers in Wuxi, all the representatives of the first Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, women's circles in Xinxiang, and Christians in Nanning, have all written letters to Japanese workers, farmers, women, and Christians, telling them not to be cannon fodder for American war-mongers in wars of aggression. All the people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in the North Sichuan District jointly wrote a letter to the Japan National Peace and Patriotic Movement Association, expressing their determination to jointly oppose the US imperialist aggression crimes that endanger the interests of the Chinese and Japanese people. People's organizations in the West Sichuan District have written letters warning the reactionary Japanese government.
    Family members of those who died in Hunan's Changde, Zhejiang's Ningbo and Quzhou during the Anti-Japanese War due to the spread of plague bacteria by Japanese bandits, as well as farmers in many urban suburbs and some areas, also held accusation meetings and demonstrations. On November 4, 1941, Japanese planes dropped a large number of grains and cotton contaminated with plague bacteria in Changde City. In that year, more than 400 people in the city died of plague. The plague also spread to neighboring counties such as Taoyuan and Linli. Recently, when the people of Changde learned that the United States was preparing to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, they were all extremely angry. On the 16th, more than 1,000 family members of the victims in the city held an accusation meeting. More than 3,000 farmers in the suburbs of Harbin painfully recalled the past fourteen years of life as cattle and horses under the rule of Japanese bandits at the accusation meeting, unanimously expressing that they would never allow the United States to rearm Japan. More than 7,000 farmers in the suburbs of Kaifeng who participated in the demonstration carried sickles, hoes, and led cattle. They said that they would take practical actions to vigorously develop agricultural production and increase economic strength to oppose the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. More than 15,000 farmers of all ethnic groups in the suburbs of Guiyang have successively held demonstrations. More than 30 farmers in Xindian Village, the 14th district of the suburbs of Beijing, said at a current affairs forum held on January 30 that they would do more publicity and improve production to oppose the United States rearming Japan. After more than 1,200 middle and primary school teachers from the winter vacation lecture hall in the Luzhou Special Zone of Southern Sichuan returned to their original places after completing their studies, the movement against the United States rearming Japan in the vast rural areas of the district quickly unfolded. Farmers in some villages in Changsha, Changde, Hengyang, Yueyang, Xiangtan, Hengshan in Hunan Province, Chengdu, Wenjiang, Huayang in Western Sichuan, Quzhou in Zhejiang Province, Jingxing County in Hebei Province and Xuanhua County in Southern Chahar also held meetings to accuse Japanese bandits of their atrocities and launched a mass movement against the United States rearming Japan.
