　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 31st: According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency, U.S. official representatives told the governments of Syria and Lebanon that if the two governments do not support the U.S. proposal in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly accusing China of being an "aggressor," the U.S. government would feel compelled to reconsider "the question of U.S. relations with the two countries." The Telecommunications Agency pointed out that this threat reflects the methods used behind the scenes in the vote on the evening of the 30th at Lake Success, which is worthy of attention. This threat was made by the U.S. Ambassador to Syria, James H. Keeley, Jr., and the Ambassador to Lebanon, Lowell Pinkerton, to the respective governments.
