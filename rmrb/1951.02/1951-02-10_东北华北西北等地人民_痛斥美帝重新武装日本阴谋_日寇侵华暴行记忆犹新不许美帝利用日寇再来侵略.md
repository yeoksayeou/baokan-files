People's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Northeast, North China, and other places have strongly condemned the American imperialist aggressive plot to step up the separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan.

Northeast

　　The Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Northeast Student Federation, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have all issued statements separately. The statement of the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation said: We will never forget the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in massacring and persecuting women and children in Northeast China in the past.

North China

　　More than 3,000 Mongol and Hui people from the Tumote Banner and the Hui Autonomous Region of Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, held a demonstration parade on the 3rd to resist the United States' aggression against Korea, oppose the United States' arming of Japan, and oppose the United States' manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass resolutions slandering our country as an "aggressor." All the lamas from the Seven Great Zhaos and Eight Small Zhaos in Guisui City and 150 Ahongs from the eight mosques in the Hui Autonomous Region also participated. A meeting was held before the parade. At the meeting, Rong Xiang (Mongol), Deputy Director of the Suiyuan Nationalities Affairs Committee, Zhang Zhuoqing (Hui), Ban Jinren, a representative of the Mongolian people, Zhang Kuan, a representative of the Hui people, Dawa, a representative of the lamas, and Yang Wanlv, the chief imam of the mosque, spoke successively. They unanimously expressed their extreme anger at the US imperialists' rearming of Japan and their manipulation of the UN General Assembly to illegally pass a slanderous case against the Chinese people. They called on people from all over the country to unite more closely and strive to stop the US imperialists' plan to expand the war of aggression. The statement issued by the business community of Zhangjiakou City stated: We, the industrialists and businessmen of Zhangjiakou, suffered from eight years of Japanese rule, and our national industry and commerce were almost completely destroyed. This painful experience is still fresh in our minds, and we will never allow Japanese militarists to make a comeback. If the US imperialists are willing to be enemies of the people of the world and conspire to arm Japan, they will only accelerate their own demise. Our Zhangjiakou industrial and commercial circles are determined to further carry out the movement to resist the US and aid Korea, thoroughly practice the four patriotic conventions, and take practical actions to fight back against the US imperialist conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. In addition, people's organizations and democratic parties in Chahar Province have also issued statements on this issue.

Northwest

　　People from all ethnic groups in the Northwest region have also issued statements or opinions. Anni Hurjakulin, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Democratic League, and others have published written opinions in newspapers opposing the United States' arming of Japan. The principals of 87 secondary schools in Gansu Province jointly issued a statement on January 30, pointing out that the Chinese people, who have suffered from the trampling of Japanese imperialism, absolutely cannot tolerate the American imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japan. The statement called on teachers and students of secondary schools in Gansu Province to unite, strengthen their work and study, and actively participate in the movement to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and relieve the Korean people.
　　More than 2,500 members of the Xinjiang People's Democratic League in Dihua City, Xinjiang Province, and Ahongs and Mullahs from 45 Islamic mosques in the city held a demonstration parade on the morning of the 3rd to oppose the American imperialists' separate peace treaty with Japan. As the parade passed through the streets, citizens of all ethnic groups angrily shouted slogans such as "Oppose the US imperialists' separate peace treaty with Japan" and "Oppose the US imperialists' rearming of Japan."

East China

　　The people of Nanjing from all walks of life, who were once massacred by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, indignantly opposed the shameless conspiracy of American imperialism to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. Lu Hao Ran's wife, Lu Li Shi, an employee of the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau, said: In 1937, Japanese devils stabbed me more than 30 times because of an attempted rape, and my unborn child also had a miscarriage. The deep blood feud has not yet been settled, and American imperialism wants to support Japan to ruin us again. I want to avenge my unborn child and myself and resolutely oppose the American imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan. Chen Shiru, a teacher at Erbanqiao Elementary School who was once captured by the Japanese invaders from the Nanjing Refugee Zone and collectively shot with machine guns but was not killed, pointed to his broken left leg and said angrily: The Japanese robbers did not kill me, and now the United States wants to support Japan to kill the Chinese people again. We will never allow it. Ma Wenxian, a worker at the Nanjing Power Plant who witnessed the Japanese invaders shooting thousands of our compatriots at Meitan Port in Nanjing, said: The Japanese devils once brutally massacred our compatriots, and the American imperialists dared to disregard the Chinese people's deep blood feud and rearm Japan. We must settle this blood debt with the American imperialists.
　　The Nanjing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression held a symposium on February 2 to oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan. People from all walks of life who attended the meeting all angrily stated that the people of Nanjing, who suffered from the Japanese massacre, resolutely opposed this shameless conspiracy of American imperialism. The city will vigorously launch a propaganda campaign against the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan and take practical actions to continue to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and consolidate national defense construction to smash the American imperialist aggression plan.
　　People's organizations such as the Nanjing Federation of Trade Unions, the Nanjing Office of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, and the Nanjing Municipal Farmers' Association have also successively issued written statements opposing the American imperialists' conspiracy of a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan.
　　People's organizations and democratic parties in Shandong, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Anhui have successively issued statements.

Southwest

　　Families of martyrs in the Anti-Japanese War and families of compatriots who suffered from indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft in Chengdu, Wenjiang, and Huayang counties in Western Sichuan have successively gathered to angrily denounce the past atrocities of Japanese imperialism and expressed their determination not to allow American imperialism to rearm Japan for aggression.
