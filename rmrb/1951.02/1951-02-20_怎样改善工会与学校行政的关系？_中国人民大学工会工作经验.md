How to Improve the Relationship Between the Trade Union and the School Administration?

In the schools of a New Democratic country, the basic interests of the trade union and the administration are consistent. The school's goal is to better complete the school's educational plan, which is also the most fundamental interest of the faculty and staff. Therefore, the Trade Union of Renmin University regards organizing and educating all faculty and staff, giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and ensuring the completion of the school's educational plan as its central task. The administration relies on the trade union organization to give play to the power of the masses to complete the teaching tasks. Therefore, the relationship between the Trade Union of Renmin University and the administration is basically consistent and close.

In order to ensure the completion of the school's education plan, the trade union launched a revolutionary competition movement during the National Day last year, calling on faculty and staff to work through competition methods. Over the past three months, great achievements have been made, which has played a good role in completing teaching and administrative tasks. For example, in the process of the competition, the Department of Diplomacy considered its work plan more carefully and used manpower more scientifically, overfulfilling the originally stipulated work tasks. Faculty members of the Department of Factory Management created specimen models, which were of great help to teaching and saved the country more than 7,000 catties of millet. A teacher in the Statistics Teaching and Research Office took the initiative to improve teaching methods in the competition, so that the students' examination results decreased from 30 percent failing to only one person failing (although this is related to the students' efforts, the improvement of teaching methods also has a great relationship). After the competition, the mimeograph group of the Research Department increased the typing efficiency by 37 percent, and the flour mill increased the output by 35 to 75 percent during the competition summary, and the quality has also been significantly improved. Members have given more play to their enthusiasm and creativity through the competition, and improved their professional level; the prestige of the trade union has also been improved accordingly. The achievements of the revolutionary competition prove that the revolutionary competition is an advanced working method for the trade union to mobilize the masses and ensure the completion of teaching and administrative tasks. This makes the trade union a reliable pillar of the administration.

The administration cherishes the trade union, helps the trade union, and relies on the trade union. At the beginning of the establishment of the trade union, the president strongly supported it, and the administration allocated 40,000 to 50,000 catties of millet as the trade union's welfare fund, and handed over the school's film projector and all the props of the cultural troupe to the trade union for use, and provided the trade union's spare-time school, supply and marketing cooperative office, club, film group with sufficient housing, furniture and equipment, and equipped with certain cadres, so that the work of the trade union could be carried out smoothly. The chairman of the trade union participated in the school committee and reported on the issue of the revolutionary competition; the administrative meeting discussed the revolutionary competition movement launched by the trade union as an important agenda item. The president and other administrative comrades also support the trade union, care about the trade union, and rely on the trade union organization to contact the masses and mobilize the masses, so that they can complete and exceed the work tasks stipulated by the administration on a broad mass basis.
            II

Although the basic interests of the trade union and the administration are consistent, there may sometimes be certain contradictions in some daily interests. The trade union should stand on the position of the members, actively make suggestions and put forward opinions to the administration on behalf of the workers, so that the reasonable demands of the workers can be realized; the administration should welcome the suggestions of the trade union and listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind. Thanks to the help of the trade union, the shortcomings of the work of individual departments have been improved and the work has been improved. For example, many salaried members requested to pay their salaries in advance at the end of the old lunar year, and the trade union took the initiative to make suggestions to the school's accounting department and asked the Ministry of Education for instructions, and the salaries were paid in advance as a result. For example, the winter clothes made by the school this year were not well made, and the chairman of the trade union reflected the opinions of the members to the president, and the administrative leaders asked the responsible department to check the work and promised to make the clothes better next time. The trade union also took the initiative to collect opinions and make suggestions to the administration on issues such as housing, food, hygiene, and member welfare. This protects the reasonable interests of the workers and helps improve administrative work.

However, some employees do not yet understand the nature and tasks of the trade union, and simply demand welfare when joining the trade union and make excessive demands on the administration. The trade union patiently persuades and educates the members to realize that the purely welfare-oriented viewpoint is wrong. This makes the relationship between the administration and the workers more harmonious.
            III

Our administration and trade union have a basically close relationship, and the trade union has done some work in protecting the reasonable interests of the workers. However, there are still shortcomings, such as the phenomenon that the administration and the trade union are not separated, and what the trade union should do is done by the administration; the trade union sometimes replaces the administrative work, and does not pay enough attention to the daily reasonable demands of the workers, and has not systematically made suggestions to the administration. The trade union has not taken the initiative to actively participate in some administrative meetings related to the lives of workers.

More than a year of work experience tells us that to fundamentally improve the relationship between the administration and the trade union, the trade union must first face the teaching, mobilize the masses, and actively ensure the completion of the school's education plan; and the administration should cherish the trade union, rely on the trade union, and regard the trade union organization as its strong pillar. Only in this way can the relationship between the administration and the trade union be closer. There are sometimes contradictions between workers and the administration on certain specific issues. Therefore, for some phenomena in the administration that ignore the interests of the workers, the trade union should stand on the position of the members and make reasonable suggestions to the administration on behalf of the workers. Only in this way can the reasonable and legitimate demands of the workers be protected and realized, and can the administration be helped to improve its work.

　　怎样改善工会与学校行政的关系？       
    ——中国人民大学工会工作经验
　　中国教育工会人民大学委员会
            一
    在新民主主义国家的学校里，工会与行政的基本利益是一致的。更好的完成学校的教育计划是学校的目的，也就是教职员工最根本的利益。所以人民大学工会把组织教育全校教职员工，发挥积极性和创造性，保证学校教育计划的完成作为自己的中心任务。而行政则依靠工会组织，发挥群众的力量来完成教学任务。所以人民大学工会与行政的关系基本上是一致的、密切的。
    工会为了保证学校教育计划的完成，在去年国庆节时发动了革命竞赛运动，号召教职员工用比赛方法进行工作。三个多月以来获得很大成绩，在完成教学与行政任务上起了很好的作用。如外交系在竞赛过程中更周密地考虑了自己的工作计划，更科学地使用人力，超额完成了原来规定的工作任务。工厂管理系教员，创造标本模型，对教学有很大帮助，并为国家节省小米七千多斤。统计教研室一位教员在竞赛中主动地改进教学方法，使学员考试成绩由百分之三十不及格减少到只有一个人不及格（这虽与学生努力有关系，但教学方法的改进亦有很大的关系）。研究部油印小组在竞赛后打字效率增加了百分之三十七，面粉厂在竞赛总结时产量提高了百分之三十五至百分之七十五，质的方面也有显著提高。会员通过竞赛更加发挥了积极性和创造性，提高了自己的业务水平；工会威信也随之提高。革命竞赛的成绩证明，革命竞赛是工会发动群众，保证完成教学行政任务的一种先进的工作方法。这样就使工会成为行政的可靠的支柱。
    行政爱护工会，帮助工会，依靠工会。在工会成立之初，校长大力支持，由行政上拨出四、五万斤小米作为工会福利基金，把学校的电影机和文工团的全部道具交给工会使用，给工会业余学校、供应社办公室、俱乐部、电影组以充分的房屋家具设备，并给配备一定的干部，使工会工作得以顺利开展。工会主席参加校委会，在会上报告革命竞赛的问题；行政会议则把工会所发动的革命竞赛运动作为重要议程来进行讨论。校长及其他行政负责同志也支持工会，关心工会，依靠工会组织联系群众，发动群众，因而，就能在广泛的群众基础上完成了并超过了行政上规定的工作任务。
            二
    工会与行政基本利益虽然一致，但在某些日常利益上有时还会产生一定的矛盾。工会应站在会员的立场上，代表职工积极地向行政建议，提出意见，使职工的合理要求得以实现；而行政方面则要欢迎工会的建议，虚心听取群众的意见。由于工会的帮助，改进了个别部门工作的缺点，提高了工作。如在旧历年关许多薪金制的会员要求提前发薪，工会就主动地向学校会计部门提出建议，并向教育部请示，结果提前发了薪金。又如学校今年的冬服作得不好，工会主席把会员的意见反映给校长，行政领导上就叫负责部门检查了这个工作，并保证下一次把衣服作得更好。还有住房、伙食、卫生、会员福利等问题，工会也主动地收集意见向行政上建议。这样就保护了职工合理的利益，也帮助改进了行政工作。
    但是也有一些职工还不太了解工会的性质和任务，参加工会时单纯要求福利，向行政上提出过高的要求。工会即耐心的说服教育，使会员认识到单纯福利观点的不对。这样就使行政与职工之间的关系更加融洽了。
            三
    我们的行政与工会的关系基本上是密切的，工会在保护职工合理利益上是作了一些工作。但还有缺点，如发生行政与工会不分的现象，应该工会做的由行政做了；工会有时也代替了行政工作，对于职工日常合理的要求关心不够，没有有系统地向行政上建议。对于有关职工生活方面的一些行政会议，工会还没有主动积极地去参加。
    一年多来的工作体验告诉我们：要从根本上搞好行政与工会关系，首先就要工会面向教学，发动群众，积极地去保证学校教育计划的完成；而行政上则应爱护工会，依靠工会，把工会组织作为自己的有力支柱。只有这样，行政与工会关系才能更加密切。职工与行政之间在某些具体问题上有时是有矛盾的。因此，对于行政上某些忽视职工利益的现象，工会应站在会员的立场上代表职工向行政上提出合理的建议。只有这样，才能保护与实现职工的合理而正当的要求，才能帮助行政上改进工作。
