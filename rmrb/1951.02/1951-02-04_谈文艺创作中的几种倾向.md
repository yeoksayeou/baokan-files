　　On Several Tendencies in Literary and Artistic Creation
　　Ruan Zhangjing

　　In the past year, I have intermittently read literary journals and other literary works from Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar, totaling more than 500 pieces and nearly two million words. To a considerable extent, these works reflect the new social life of the people in North China during the transition from victory in the war and the end of land reform to peaceful construction. Many promising, talented, and closely connected with the masses young authors have emerged in our literary and artistic garden.

　　New themes have appeared in many better works. Some of the more prominent works reflecting the lives of workers include the drama "Not a Cicada" by Wei Lianzhen, a railway worker in Shijiazhuang; the novel "An Unexpected Thing" by Chen Zhiming in Shanxi (the inaugural issue of "Shanxi Literature"); and the novel "Unity is Strength" by Zhang Peihong (Volume 1, Issue 2 of "Shanxi Literature"). Works reflecting the new life in rural North China include the novel "New Things Done in a New Way" by Gu Yu (Issue 5 of "Hebei Literature"); the short story "Spring and Autumn Picture" by Li Shuwei (the inaugural issue of "Shanxi Literature"); the novel "Surplus Grain" by Li Fangli and Wang Yunbo (Volume 1, Issue 6 of "Pingyuan"); and the short poems by Qin Yi, a 52-year-old farmer from Lin County, Pingyuan (Volume 2, Issue 4 of "Pingyuan"), and so on. These themes no longer dwell only on reflecting past suffering, but focus on depicting how to happily build a happy motherland today. Most of these works are written by new young authors, and although some are not perfect, it should be admitted that these works reflect real life fairly truthfully and have a certain educational significance.

　　Generally speaking, there are not enough works with high ideological and artistic quality. We still have some problems in our creation, and the people are asking us to change this situation.

　　　　The So-Called "Propaganda in Disguise" and "Not Satisfying Thirst"

　　Some of our works are not good at elucidating the Party and the country's policies from the real life of the people, but rather use the appearance of a few characters to conceptually explain the policies. Some dramas or current affairs political poems have too many political nouns and terms, rarely express the real emotions and language of the people, and lack profound persuasiveness. Therefore, the masses criticize them as "propaganda in disguise" and feel that they are "not satisfying thirst."

　　Our country's policies are in line with the greatest interests of all the people. There are many problems in real life, and the masses ask us to answer them correctly. As long as we delve into real life, deeply understand the inner demands of the masses, and guide the masses' actions with policy ideas, the masses will accept them and will not feel that they are "propaganda in disguise." Unfortunately, some of our works show that the authors are not familiar with life and do not know the people's thoughts and demands. Not only that, but the authors sometimes do not understand the policies either. For example, some works oppose all exploitation in general terms. Land reform has been completed in most parts of North China, social life is stable, and the people are enthusiastically demanding production and prosperity, demanding improved technology, and demanding organization under new production conditions. This is the inner demand of the broad masses, who demand leadership and correct answers. However, many of our authors cannot correctly observe new things and cannot deeply understand the real demands of the masses, and are still writing works like "The Suffering of Peasants." No wonder the peasants say: "Always complaining and pouring out bitterness, who hasn't had a period of bitterness in the past?" They feel tired of it. Several works about organizing labor still remain in the primitive state of overcoming the lack of labor and animal power many years ago, and do not know that today's organization of labor has more abundant new content, such as requiring improved technology, the use of new agricultural tools, scientific methods to eliminate pests, and the development of production, and therefore cannot arouse the interest of the masses.

　　It is undeniable that some of our works have not paid enough attention to the new issues that the masses are urgently concerned about. The people are eager for more works with a certain level of height, a serious creative attitude, and full of realistic combat significance. The people are not satisfied when we only come out to "respond to the occasion" when the realistic struggle is unavoidable, and hastily and perfunctorily put together "Defending Peace," "Production and Prosperity," and "Production for Self-Relief." The creative attitude of "filling the gaps" and "better than nothing" must be overcome. Of course, works depicting the great struggle scenes of the past, and pointing out the prospects for a better future, especially works depicting revolutionary war, are still very much needed. But we cannot therefore create behind closed doors, and we should always maintain close contact with life. However, some of our works of this kind are also written very hastily, and the revolutionary people's fighting spirit and mass language are not full enough. This also shows that our past contact with life was not close. If we are divorced from the realistic struggle today, we will not be able to understand today in the future. Being divorced from reality means not being able to understand history.

　　　　"Hoeing the Ground, Wielding the Sledgehammer" and "Small Family"

　　After watching our plays, the farmers in the old liberated areas said: "All we see is hoeing the ground, what's the point?" After listening to the choral evening, the workers in the factory said: "In the workshop, the machines are roaring all day long, and watching the plays and listening to the songs is also the sound of machines roaring, sigh!" I think we should accept this criticism. Many works on production only write about the production process and figures, like an achievement report, and cannot excavate the real activities of life and thought, which is a common shortcoming. Writing about the countryside should not just be about holding production meetings, making plans, reclaiming wasteland, and hoeing the ground; writing about workers should not just be about machine rooms and wielding sledgehammers. Artistic works are not exterior photography, but rather depict people's lives and write about people's thoughts and attitudes towards things. If the work lacks ideological criticism, the ideology is low, the educational significance is less, and it cannot move the reader (audience); if the work lacks artistic processing, it is only a record of the exterior appearance of life, and cannot make people like to watch it. Literary and artistic works cannot be ordered to be finished with a hard head, but should be made so that people cannot help but watch them.

　　Writing about the new happy life of the people is very necessary. However, the works in various places too often feature "Young Couples Making Plans," "Husband and Wife Competition," "Husband and Wife Arguing," etc. Most of them insert a joke in the work, make a fun, amuse, and finally turn from anger to joy, sing a few words of gratitude to the leader, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, and then feel satisfied. Locking such a broad new social life in a small producer's small family is also one of the manifestations of the lack of ideology in the work. The new happy family life should be written, but the writer's task should also be to guide the masses to a higher and better ideal life, and needs to educate the farmers with advanced class ideas. However, the ideas in these works are exactly the same as the ideas of some backward elements in the current rural revolutionary ranks: "Thirty mu of land and an ox, wife and children on a warm kang." "The world is peaceful, there is no fate to revolt," satisfied with the narrow family happiness, forgetting the great task entrusted to our entire people by the motherland. Lacking a positive fighting will, this can only guide people to "retreat," and cannot encourage people to move forward.

　　"The people have gone through a long period of war and tension, and now we should give the people happiness," this sentence is often heard in the discussion of creative issues this year. If we use this to improve the level of thought and art, and overcome formalism and the old ways, it is positive; if we misuse it to pursue purely personal pleasure and vulgar humor, it is negative. New realism should be full of fresh and pleasant humor, full of innocent smiles, and full of unlimited optimism about life. The forward-looking humor naturally arises from vivid life, and has a principled difference from artificial and vulgar gimmicks.

　　Our people are a diligent, brave, and intelligent nation. We should describe these noble virtues. The working people of North China, like giants in mythology, have made great contributions in the cause of liberation of the motherland. We want to write about them, to write about the new people of our people's motherland, so we are not allowed to write them dirty! However, there are still a few works that have not paid attention to this point. Often in order to make a joke, the healthy theme is soiled. For example, there is a poem about rural new life that is written very well, but the last sentence says: "The old couple talked more and more happily, and the old man felt a little itchy on his body. He hurriedly took off his cotton-padded jacket and called out to his wife, 'I'll catch the lice, you scratch my back for me.'" This is inappropriate. The comrades in our editorial department should help the new authors work, help them revise, or offer suggestions, which will reduce these mistakes. As for the "small feet" of women, this scar that the dark ages had left on some of our sisters had long since healed. But there are still a few works that mention it. One of them focuses on writing on a hero. There is a work that is written very well, but in order to portray the protagonist's conservative thinking, the author put a small braid on his head. These are all wrong.

　　　　"The Old Ways" and "Rigid Forms"

　　Opening up the literary books, periodicals and newspapers from the past five years to this year, we can see many works that are not very different, such as "New Year's Greetings," "Four Daughters (or Ten Daughters) Praising Their Husbands," "Literacy Cards," "Transformation of the Loafer," "Persuading the Lazy Man," "Glorious Flowers," etc. There are also songs praising new heroes, and the ending must be an award ceremony with red flowers, and after hearing the opening gong and drums, we know how it will end. In poems praising the new era, there are too many "Red Flowers," "Sun," "Red Flag," "Victory," "Forward," "Long Live," "Gongs and Drums," "Add Oil, Work Hard," "Alas, Oh, Cough, Ho," etc. The great era of the people is advancing by leaps and bounds, the struggle life of the people is vast and boundless, and the language of the people is rich and beautiful, but the emotions and vocabulary we express in our works are too monotonous and narrow. It is not to say that these things should not be written, and that words such as "Red Flag" and "Long Live" cannot be used, but they should be written when necessary according to the people's life feelings.

　　In many storytelling lyrics, the beginning must be a section of "West River Moon," or "The string is pulled and wails, the folks and comrades sit on both sides," "Leaving aside the idle words, let's get down to business, strike the clapperboard to open the formal announcement," and then from east to west, from heaven to earth, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, a long set of outlines and introductions of "not saying this" and "not mentioning that," wasting efforts and only returning to the main topic after half a day. In each article, I don't know how many "listen to the heart," "make the words clear," "express the details," "for that matter," "the ground is smooth," "the reason is clear"; and there are also strange words and tunes such as "dark sorrow and misery" and "the courtyard faces the sun." It is a pity to bury the fresh and lively life content in an ancient tomb. Some are too accommodating to the old forms, and apply old clichés without criticism, writing the female worker models in the factory as "two curved eyebrows like autumn moon," "lips like cinnabar and teeth like jade," and some write "walking like willows encountering the wind," etc., putting the new working women into ancient picture frames to be appreciated as morbid beauties. Writing about our soldiers is: wearing a hat on their heads, what leather shoes on their feet, wearing what clothes on their bodies, and a cowhide battle belt around their waists, etc., almost like the twenty-eight constellations in magical novels. It is inappropriate to write about the heroes of our People's Republic like this. We must learn the traditional forms of the people, respect national heritage, but we should create with new life ideas and language, break through it, throw away the parts that have already become rigid, and turn it into a vibrant, fighting, youthful form.

　　Any work cannot be done well without using the brain. Creation requires hard use of the brain and requires hard work to become familiar with life. Skill comes from the refinement and processing of life. It is convenient but low-level to use ready-made forms to copy and imitate. Literary and artistic works are to be created, not imitated. Don't be afraid if the creation is not good at the beginning and is a bit childish. Everyone's growth has a naive period. What is terrible is that everything is the same and there is no progress.

　　We are all learning to write, and it is not surprising that the above-mentioned shortcomings occur. As long as we know them, we can overcome them. The people are eagerly awaiting the emergence of good works that can "satisfy thirst." The people need us to work, and the Party and the government are concerned about and helping us. Our work needs to be improved a step further.

　　谈文艺创作中的几种倾向
    阮章竞
    一年来，我断断续续地读过河北、山西、平原、察哈尔的文艺刊物和一些别的文艺作品，约五百余篇，将近二百万言。这些作品，在相当程度上，反映了华北人民由战争胜利、土地改革结束转入和平建设时期新的社会生活面貌。我们的文艺园地上出现了很多有希望的、有才能的、密切联系群众的年青作者。
    新的主题，已在许多较好的作品中出现。反映工人生活比较突出的有石家庄铁路工人魏连珍的剧本《不是蝉》，山西陈志铭的小说《一件意外的事情》（《山西文艺》创刊号），张培洪的小说《团结就是力量》（《山西文艺》一卷二期）。反映华北农村新的生活的有谷峪的小说《新事新办》（《河北文艺》五期），李束为的短篇小说《春秋图》（《山西文艺》创刊号），李方立、王云波的小说《余粮》（《平原》一卷六期），平原林县五十二岁的老农民板人秦易的短诗（《平原》二卷四期）等。这些主题，已不是只停留于反映过去的痛苦，而是着重地描写今天如何愉快地建设幸福的祖国。这些作品绝大部分是新的青年作者写的，有的虽然写得并不完美，但应该承认，这些作品都是相当真实地反映了现实生活，具有一定教育意义的。
    从总的情况来说，有较高的思想性艺术性的作品还不够多。我们在创作上还存在一些问题，人民在要求我们改变这种状况。
            所谓“化装宣传”与“不解渴”
    我们的某些作品，还不善于从人民的真实生活中，去阐明党与国家的政策，而是借某几个人物的外形，概念地去讲解政策。有些戏剧或时事政治诗，政治名词术语太多，很少表现人民的真实情绪和语言，缺乏深刻的说服力，因之群众评它为“化装宣传”，感到“不解渴”。
    我们国家的政策是符合全体人民的最大利益的。现实生活面前摆着很多问题，群众要求我们正确地解答，只要深入现实生活，深知群众的内在要求，以政策思想指导群众行动，群众是会接受的，而不致感到是在“化装宣传”。可惜我们有些作品，表现作者是不熟悉生活，不熟知人民的思想和要求的。不但如此，作者有时也并不了解政策，如有些作品笼统地反对一切剥削。华北绝大部分地区土改完成，社会生活安定，人民热烈地要求生产发家，要求提高技术，要求在新的生产条件下组织起来。这是广大群众的内在要求，群众要求领导，要求正确的回答。但我们的许多作者不会正确地观察新鲜事物，不会深刻地了解群众真实要求，还在写《农民苦》之类的作品。难怪农民说：“老是诉苦倒苦水，谁过去没有段苦？”觉得腻了。有几篇写组织劳动力的作品，仍停留在多少年前克服劳力畜力不足的原始状况，不知道今天的劳动力的组织已有了更丰富的新内容，如要求改良技术，运用新农具，科学方法除害虫，发展生产等，因而引不起群众的兴趣。
    不可否认，我们有的作品对群众所迫切关心的新问题，仍未给以足够的注意。人民渴望更多的有一定高度水平、创作态度严肃、充满现实战斗意义的作品出现。人民不满意当现实斗争逼得无法，我们才出来“应景”一番，潦潦草草，马马虎虎地凑上个《保卫和平》、《生产发家》、《生产自救》。“补补空白”，“有比无好”的创作态度必须克服。当然，描写过去的伟大斗争场面，而对更好的将来指出远景的作品，特别是描写革命战争的作品，还是十分需要的。但不能因此而关起门来创作，应当经常和生活保持密切的接触。然而我们有几篇这类的作品，也写得很草率，革命人民的战斗气息和群众语言都不够饱满。这也说明我们过去和生活联系是不密切的。今天如果再脱离现实斗争，将来也不能了解今天。脱离现实，是不能理解历史的。
            “锄地、抡铁锤”、“小家庭”
    老区的农民看罢我们的戏后说：“看见的净是锄地，有什么意思？”工厂的工人听罢歌咏晚会说：“在车间成天机器轰隆隆响，看戏听唱歌也是机器轰隆隆响，唉！”我以为，我们应该接受这个批评。很多写生产的作品，只是写生产过程和数目字，像篇成绩报告书，不能发掘到生活思想的真实活动，是一般的缺点。写农村的不应该只是开生产会，订计划，开荒锄地；写工人的不应该只是机器房，抡铁锤。艺术作品不是外形摄影，而是描写人的生活，写人对事物的思想和态度。作品没有思想批判，思想性就低，教育意义就少，不能感动读者（观众）；作品没有艺术加工，只是生活外形的记录，不能使人喜欢看。文艺作品，是不能命令人硬着头皮看完的，应该是使人不能不看才好。
    写人民新的愉快生活，非常必要。但各地的作品，太多地出现《小俩口订计划》，《夫妻竞赛》、《夫妻顶嘴》等等。绝大多数在作品中插上个笑话，闹个玩儿，逗个乐儿，最后是转嗔为喜，歌唱几句感谢领袖、感谢共产党和人民政府，就算心满意足了。把如此广阔的新社会生活，锁在一个小生产者的小家庭里，这也是作品缺乏思想性的表现之一。新的家庭幸福生活，应该写，但作家的任务，还应当引导群众走向更高有美好前途的理想生活上去，需要以先进的阶级思想教育农民。而这些作品的思想，恰和目前某些农村革命队伍中的落后分子的思想“三十亩土地一头牛，老婆孩子热炕头”同出一辙。“天下太平，无命可革了”，满足于狭小的天伦之乐，忘记了祖国交给我们全体人民的伟大任务。缺乏积极的战斗意志，这便只能引导人们“退坡”，而不能鼓舞人们前进。
    “人民经过长期战争的紧张生活，现在应该给人民以愉快”，今年在创作问题讨论中，常听到这句话。如果以此去提高思想水平与艺术水平，克服形式主义，老一套，就是积极的；如果错用它去追求纯粹个人的享乐和庸俗的滑稽，那就是消极的。新现实主义应该是充满新鲜愉快的风趣，充满天真的笑容，对生活充满无限的乐观。前进的诙谐，是从活生生的生活中，自然而然地产生的，和矫揉造作的庸俗噱头有原则的区别。
    我国人民是一个勤劳勇敢，智慧的民族。我们应该描写这些高尚的美德。华北的劳动人民，在祖国的解放事业中，像神话上的巨人似地，尽了伟大的贡献。我们要写他们，写我们人民祖国的新人，因此我们是不许可把他们写脏的！但还有少数作品，还未注意到这一点。常常为了逗个乐，结果把健康主题弄脏了。如有一篇写农村新生活的诗作，写得很好，但最后写道：“老俩口越谈越高兴，老头觉得身上有点刺痒。急忙脱下大棉袄，开言叫声孩子他娘，我拿拿虱子你替我挠挠后脊梁。”这就是不适当的。我们编辑部的同志们，应该帮助新的作者工作，帮他们改改，或提出意见，就会减少这些过失。关于妇女的“小脚”，这个已经死去的黑暗时代加在我们一些姊妹身上的创伤，早已脱痂了。但有几篇作品还在提它。有一篇是着重地写在一个英雄身上。有一篇作品，写得很好，但作者为刻划主人公的保守思想，在他的头上出现一小根辫子。这些都是错误的。
            “老一套”与“僵化的形式”
    翻开近五年到今年的文艺书刊报章，看见不少的什么《拜年》、《四女（或十女）夸夫》、《识字牌》、《二流子转变》、《劝懒汉》、《光荣花》等等区别不大的作品。还有歌颂新英雄，最后必定是受奖大会戴红花，听了开台锣鼓，就知道将是如何煞尾收科。赞美新时代的诗歌中，过多的是《红花》、《太阳》、《红旗》、《胜利》、《前进》、《万岁》、《锣儿鼓儿》、《加油，努力》、《唉噢咳嗬》等等。人民的大时代在突飞猛进，人民的斗争生活广阔无边，人民的语言丰富美丽，但我们在作品上表现的情绪和词汇，太单调狭小了。不是说这些东西不应该写，“红旗”“万岁”等字不可以用，而是应该根据人民的生活感情，写在必要的时候。
    许多说唱词上，开头一定是段《西江月》，或“弦子一拉嗡嗡响，老乡同志们坐两旁”，“撇开闲言书归正，打起鼓板开正封”，接着从东到西，从天到地，古今中外，“不说这”“不表那”的一大套提纲引子，枉费周章，半天才书归正传。每篇不知多少“听心间”、“把话明”、“表其详”、“为那桩”、“地溜平”、“明理端”；还有类似“暗愁惨”、“院当阳”等衰老腐朽的奇言怪调。把新鲜活泼的生活内容，埋在一座古坟里去，这是很可惜的。有的过于迁就旧形式，不加批判地套用陈旧的词句，把工厂的女工模范，写成“两道眉弯秋月样”，“唇如丹朱牙赛玉”，还有的写“走路像杨柳遇见了风”等等，把新的劳动妇女，装进古画框子里去作病态美人来欣赏。写我们的战士是：头戴一顶什么帽，什么皮鞋脚上登，身上穿着什么装，牛皮战带系腰中等等，几乎是神奇小说里的二十八宿。把我们人民共和国的英雄这样来写是不恰当的。要学习人民的传统形式，要尊贵民族遗产，但应以新的生活思想语言去创造，突破它，扔掉已经僵死的部分，把它变为充满朝气的，战斗的青春的形式。
    任何一件工作，不用脑子是做不好的。创作是需要艰苦地用脑子，是需要艰苦地去熟悉生活。技巧是从生活中提炼加工来的，用现成的形式去套，摹仿，是方便，但是低级的。文艺作品是要创作，不是要摹仿，开头创作得不好，幼稚点，不要怕，每个人的成长都有个幼稚时期。可怕的是千篇一律，没有进步。
    我们都是在学习写作，发生上述的缺点并不奇怪，只要我们知道了，就能克服。人民在热烈期待能“解渴”的好作品产生。人民需要我们工作，党和政府都在关心帮助我们，我们的工作需要提高一步。
