　　Under the leadership of the Party, do a good job in the Youth League's publicity work to the people
　　——Editorial of "China Youth" No. 57——
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing a Publicity Network for the Masses of the People Throughout the Party" on January 1. This decision is an extremely important step in strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. The Youth League committees at all levels should convey this to all Youth League members and the broad masses of young people. The propaganda departments of the League at all levels should conduct serious study and discussion.
    Facts have proved that making the publicity work for the people extensive and in-depth, and opening up the minds of the masses, will enable seemingly difficult tasks to be completed smoothly. Conversely, if publicity work is neglected and the masses do not understand the significance of the work, even tasks that seem easy to complete will result in coercion and formalism. However, the view that publicity work for the people is only the work of a few people and is temporary also exists in the organizations of the Youth League. The attitude of not valuing and not being serious about publicity work still exists in the minds of some cadres. This has resulted in insufficient and poor publicity work in many places. The ideological confusion that appeared in some places in the early stages of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement was inseparable from the lack of publicity work. Although, at present, many local League organizations of the Youth League attach importance to publicity work and have already achieved results in their work, first of all, due to the view within the League that this work is the temporary work of a few people, due to the failure to establish a necessary and perfect system for carrying out publicity work to the people and young people, and the lack of systematic leadership and management of publicity work, as a result, the publicity to the people and young people is only carried out in a blitzkrieg manner and cannot be carried out regularly. The Central Committee of the Youth League issued the "Provisional Outline of the Work of the Youth League Propagandists" in August last year, which took a step forward in establishing an internal education system of the League. However, the propagandists established according to this outline are mainly responsible for educating League members on the basic knowledge of the League and elementary political education. Although the "Provisional Outline of the Work of the Youth League Propagandists" also stipulates that propagandists should publicize current affairs and policies to young people inside and outside the League, in fact, most of the propagandists in the areas where propagandists have been established have only carried out education on the League's program and constitution to League members. In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, the expansion of current affairs publicity resulted in the regular education of League members being affected. Because propagandists bear both education and publicity work, and because of the different contents of these two types of work, propagandists often suffer from the phenomenon of losing sight of the other in their work. Secondly, because of the lack of unified management and leadership of publicity work for the people in each production unit, the phenomenon of overlapping and waste in the League's publicity work with the Party's, administrative, and trade union's publicity work has occurred, that is, the publicity of the same central work task or current affairs policy is organized separately by the Party, government, trade union, and the League, and the maximum effect of division of labor and cooperation cannot be achieved. These problems that existed in the publicity work of the Youth League in the past period should be resolved from the issuance of this resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The phenomenon of underestimating and neglecting publicity work must be stopped; the view that it is the temporary work of a few people must be corrected; a regular and necessary system must be established; the division of labor of the various publicity work forces must be determined. This will greatly improve the strength and effect of our publicity work. In this way, the propagandists established by the Youth League for the purpose of establishing regular League education, and in order to avoid confusion with the name of the propagandists established by the Party to establish a publicity network, will be renamed study counselors in the future; they should take the education of League members on the basic knowledge of the League and elementary political education as their main task, while the task of publicizing to the people, that is, publicizing the policies and tasks of the Party and the People's Government and current affairs to the people, shall be uniformly undertaken by the Party's publicity network. In this way, the Youth League's publicity work for the people will be carried out regularly under the direct leadership of the Party, and will be greatly strengthened because it is directly led by the Party.
    However, if some League organizations believe that in this way, the Youth League can reduce its responsibility in the future publicity work for the people, then this idea is obviously wrong. The Youth League is a close assistant and reserve force of the Communist Party of China, and it must become a model for leading the broad masses of young people to actively implement the Party's decisions. In the "Decision on Establishing a Publicity Network for the Masses of the People Throughout the Party" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it is clearly stipulated that each branch secretary and branch committee member of the Youth League and Youth League members who have regular work contacts with the people (such as trade union cadres, cooperative cadres, district and village cadres, school teachers, staff of people's education halls, wall newspaper editors, etc.) should serve as propagandists established by the Party branch. All Youth League members must recognize that this is a glorious task assigned to Youth League members by the Communist Party of China. All League member cadres who are qualified to serve as propagandists should actively and enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee. After being appointed as propagandists, they must conscientiously and responsibly do this work well.
    In the future, the regular business of Youth League members in serving as propagandists (such as publicity guidelines, content, training of propagandists, summary of experiences, etc.) should be led by the Party branch to which they belong. Their specific division of labor is also stipulated by the Party branch propagandist meeting. The task of publicizing to the people stipulated by the Party branch should be the first task to be completed by each Youth League member serving as a propagandist. However, the publicity of the resolutions, instructions, work tasks of the Youth League's higher-level organizations, the personal problems and ideological cultivation of young people, and the significance of youth commemorative festivals to Youth League members and the broad masses of young people should also be listed as one of the work tasks of Youth League members serving as propagandists. Naturally, the specific work tasks in this regard can be stipulated by the Youth League branch according to the specific circumstances at the time and place, and carried out after being agreed by the Party branch committee. As for youth issues that need to be publicized not only to young people but also to the entire people, the Youth League branch can suggest to the Party branch or propagandist meeting to be listed as one of the publicity contents of all propagandists. The Youth League organization must regularly check and supervise whether the League member cadres serving as propagandists have well completed the task of publicizing to the people. And assist the Party organization in providing propagandists with popular publicity materials. In the new areas where the Party organization has not been universally established, the League organization should increase its responsibility for publicizing to the people. (As for production units where the Party has not yet been established, if a publicity network is established, the responsibility for leadership can be entrusted and designated by the higher-level Party committee.)
    The broad masses of young people welcome the publicity work carried out by the Youth League members' propagandists, especially the direct speeches made to them by the League leaders. The Youth League leaders should regularly and directly publicize and explain the current affairs, policies, work tasks, and work experience to the masses of young people in a systematic way. The secretaries and members of the Youth League provincial, municipal, local, county, and district committees should make at least one political report to the gatherings and representative meetings of urban and rural young people (first of all, workers and peasants) every two months. The topics and main points of these reports should be stipulated or approved by the League committees at all levels to which they belong, and the results of the reports should be reported to the Party and League committees at all levels. The League committees at all levels should regularly study how to ensure that this work can be carried out correctly and continuously improved, and select appropriate reports for publication in the League newspapers and periodicals.
    As pointed out in the People's Daily editorial: Comrade Mao Zedong constantly opposed the view of underestimating publicity work. Comrade Stalin also pointed out that publicity work "is always one of the main tools of the Party." Let all our Youth League members and League cadres strive to implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Party, further strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, and further exert the great task of the Youth League to unite and educate the younger generation.

### 在党的领导下作好青年团对人民群众的宣传工作  《中国青年》第五十七期社论

　　在党的领导下作好青年团对人民群众的宣传工作       
    ——《中国青年》第五十七期社论——
    中共中央在一月一日发布了《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》。这一决定，是为了密切党和群众联系的一个极重要的步骤。青年团各级团委应向全体青年团员和广大青年群众进行传达。团的各级宣传部门应进行认真的研究和讨论。
    事实证明把对人民群众的宣传工作作得广泛而深入，打通了群众思想，就会使看来似乎困难的任务，能够顺利完成。相反，如果忽视了宣传工作，群众不明了工作的意义，就会使看来似乎容易完成的任务，也发生强迫命令和形式主义。可是，把对人民群众的宣传，当做只是一部分人的和临时性的工作，这一观点在青年团的组织中也是存在着的。对待宣传工作不重视不认真的态度也还在一部分干部思想中存在。这就使得许多地方宣传工作做得不够和不好。在抗美援朝运动初期某些地方呈现出的思想上的某些混乱，是和宣传工作的缺少分不开的。虽然，目前青年团有许多地方团的组织重视了宣传工作，并且已经在工作中收得了效果，但首先，由于团内存在着把这一工作当作一部分人的临时性工作的观点，由于没有建立向人民群众与青年群众进行宣传工作的必要的完善的制度，缺少对宣传工作的有系统的领导和管理，结果也使向人民群众与青年群众的宣传只有突击式的工作而不能经常进行。团中央在去年八月发布了《青年团宣传员工作暂行纲要》，在建立团内教育制度方面向前推进了一步，但是，根据这一纲要所设立的宣传员，主要任务是向团员进行关于团的基本知识教育和初级政治教育。虽然《青年团宣传员工作暂行纲要》也规定了宣传员要向团内外青年进行时事、政策的宣传，但实际上业经设立宣传员的地区，极大部分的宣传员只进行了对团员的团纲团章的教育。在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，由于要扩大时事宣传，结果又使团员的经常教育受到影响。由于宣传员同时负担了教育和宣传工作，又由于这两种工作内容的不同，因此常使得宣传员在自己的工作中发生了顾此失彼的现象。其次，由于对人民群众的宣传工作在每一生产单位中缺少统一的管理和领导，就发生了团的宣传工作，与党的、行政的、工会等的宣传工作重叠浪费现象，即同一内容的中心工作任务或时事政策的宣传，党、政、工、团分头组织报告和宣传，而不能收到分工合作的最大效果。过去一个时期青年团宣传工作中所存在的这些问题，都应该从中共中央这一决议的发布而获得了解决。轻视忽视宣传工作的现象必须停止；把它当做一部分人临时工作的观点必须纠正；经常的必要的制度必须建立；各部分宣传工作力量的分工必须确定。这就会使我们的宣传工作力量和效果，大大提高一步。这样，青年团为了建立经常的团的教育而设立的宣传员，为了避免与党建立宣传网而设立的宣传员名称相混淆，今后改称为学习辅导员；他们应把对团员进行团的基本知识及初级政治教育作为自己主要的任务，而把对人民群众进行宣传的任务，即对人民群众进行关于党和人民政府政策任务的宣传和时事的宣传，统一由党的宣传网担任。这样，青年团对人民群众的宣传工作，将进一步在党的直接领导下经常进行，并将因为得到党的直接领导而大为加强。
    可是，如果有的团的组织，认为这样一来，青年团在今后的对人民群众的宣传工作中，就可以减轻了自己的责任，那么这种想法，显然是不对的。青年团是中国共产党的亲密助手和后备军，它必须成为带动广大青年积极执行党的决定的模范。在中共中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》中，明确规定了青年团的每个支部书记、支部委员和与人民群众有经常工作联系的青年团员（例如工会干部、合作社干部、区村干部、学校教师、民众教育馆的职员、墙报编辑等）都应当担任党支部所设立的宣传员。全体青年团员必须认识这是中国共产党分配给青年团员的光荣任务。凡具备担任宣传员条件的团员干部，都应积极踊跃响应党中央的号召。在被任命为宣传员之后，他们必须认真负责把这一工作做好。
    今后青年团员在担任宣传员工作方面的经常业务（如宣传方针、内容，宣传员的训练，经验总结等）应当由所属的党的支部领导。他们的具体分工也由党支部宣传员会议规定。党支部所规定的对人民群众宣传的任务，应该是每个担任宣传员的青年团员的首先要完成的任务。但对青年团员和广大青年群众宣传青年团上级组织的决议、指示、工作任务、青年切身问题与思想修养、青年纪念节日的意义等，也应列为担任宣传员的青年团员的工作任务之一。自然，这一方面的具体工作任务，可由青年团支部按当时当地具体情况规定，并由党支部委员会同意后进行。至于，有必要不只对青年群众而且要对全体人民群众进行宣传的青年问题，可由青年团的支部向党的支部或宣传员会议建议，列为全体宣传员的宣传内容之一。青年团的组织，必须经常检查督促担任宣传员的团员干部，是否很好地完成了向人民群众的宣传任务。并协助党组织供给宣传员通俗的宣传资料。在党的组织尚未普遍建立的新区，团的组织更应该加重自己在对人民群众宣传的责任。（至于尚未建党的生产单位，如建立了宣传网，其领导责任可请上级党委委托和指定。）
    广大青年群众很欢迎青年团员的宣传员对他们进行的宣传工作，特别是欢迎团的负责人向他们直接讲话。青年团的负责人应该经常地直接地向青年群众作关于时事、政策、工作任务、工作经验的有系统的宣传解释。青年团省、市、地方、县、区委员会的书记和委员，均应于每两个月向城乡青年群众（首先是工农群众）的集会和代表会议作至少一次的政治报告。这些报告的题目和内容要点应由所属的团的各级委员会规定或批准，报告的结果应向党和团的各级委员会报告。各级团的委员会应经常研究如何使这一工作能正确进行与不断地改善，并选择适当的报告在团报团刊上公布。
    正如人民日报社论所指出的：毛泽东同志不断反对轻视宣传工作的观点。斯大林同志也指出过：宣传工作“随时随地都是党的主要工具之一”。让我们全体青年团员和团的干部，努力执行党中央的决定，更加密切党和人民群众的联系，更加发挥青年团的团结教育青年一代的伟大任务。
