Seriously and Accurately Create Images of Soldiers

　　Hou Jinjing

　　Last December, the Political Department Cultural Troupe of the North China Military Region Artillery performed the opera "Grip the Gun Tightly" at the Capital's Anti-American Aid-Korea Art and Literature Observation Evening. Although it was inevitably a bit rough due to the short rehearsal time, its theme was sharp, and some of the plot points were moving. Performing this play in the midst of the army's enthusiastic Anti-American Aid-Korea movement was timely.

　　However, after the performance, comrades from cultural and artistic circles in the capital raised many opinions. Everyone thought that some actors distorted the image of soldiers, bringing the backward and ignorant elements that existed among the old peasants – elements that are rapidly changing among today's peasants – onto the stage uncritically and without selection. In particular, some actors exaggerated the act of spitting. This not only failed to express the essence of a People's Liberation Army soldier's life but also made the soldiers appear to lack political and cultural cultivation. The comrades of the Artillery Political Department Cultural Troupe humbly listened to these opinions, studied and examined them, and unanimously believed that this tendency was harmful and should be overcome.

　　This tendency existed, more or less, in other cultural troupes in the North China Military Region.

　　We often portray cadres, heroes, and advanced elements as being dry and weak, while portraying ordinary soldiers as having vulgar tastes, low-level language, and a lack of education. Especially when dealing with characters who still have shortcomings in their thinking, the shortcomings are exaggerated to the point of being detached from the basis of real life, making them seem unlike characters nurtured and grown up in the army. Before conducting detailed descriptions in the creative and performance process, the vivid and concrete life that emerges in the minds of the authors, actors, and directors is often the side of the farmer-born soldiers' ignorance and laxity that has been overcome and is being overcome; while the new and noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army that are growing and moving forward often become dim and conceptual in their minds. Lacking an in-depth understanding of the progressive side, and often favoring the backward side in their thinking, thinking it is vivid and interesting, they highlight and exaggerate it.

　　If you pay attention to looking for them, it is not difficult to find many specific examples: such as cooks, these figures who play an important role in the material guarantee of the army's combat and training. They are hardworking, simple, and willing to bear hardships. Some older cooks have humorous and funny characters. They care about the soldiers, and the soldiers respect them. However, when they are portrayed on stage, they often emphasize dirtiness (apron, face, hands), low political awareness, and become the object of jokes and teasing by the soldiers. When the North China Military Region Cultural Troupe performed "Growing Up in Battle," the actors seemed to focus on this aspect, while weakening the aspect of being brave enough to go to the battlefield and caring for the soldiers like an old father, as stipulated in the script (the script itself also has shortcomings). The laughable elements exceeded the elements that make people respect them, and the excellent qualities were covered up by slapstick.

　　The drama "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn," jointly performed by the North China Air Force Political Department Cultural Troupe and the North China Military Region Cultural Troupe, also had many similar examples: At night, the district squad lives in a village. A sentry wanted to smoke, so he left his post and deliberately made up a fake situation, waking everyone up to ask for tobacco. This exaggerates guerrilla habits, distorts life, and harms the character. In the last scene, an old woman gives eggs to comfort the soldiers. The soldiers cannot accept them because they have to abide by the discipline of the masses, but at the same time, they emphasize that they want to eat them so much that their saliva is about to drip, turning the consciousness and seriousness of discipline into a child's play. Everyone's body is itchy. In order to describe the abundance of lice, they show all kinds of scratching and catching methods. When breaking through the encirclement, they carry towels on their bodies, but take off their single hats to wipe their sweat, damaging the soldiers' heroic, firm, and decisive qualities... Some of these were corrected in later performances, but the understanding is still not enough, and some have not been recognized, so they have not been corrected.

　　The Tianjin Garrison Political Department Cultural Troupe created and performed "Vigilance," which describes how to transform a squad leader's bureaucratic style and improve vigilance against counter-revolutionaries. In order to portray the squad leader's shortcomings, they emphasized that the soldiers kept nagging and making noise because they had opinions until the squad leader recognized and changed his shortcomings. In order to highlight the shortcomings in leadership, they uncritically described the style of extreme democratization, reducing the work's reality and making the subsequent transformation of the entire class's unity and progress lack strength. The author and actors probably have not yet had a deep understanding of this point.

　　In other cultural troupes' creations and performances, things that exist, such as: vulgar tastes (when family members come, everyone makes nasty jokes), low-level language, especially some terrible idioms; describing heroes who would rather die than surrender, there must be a series of dirty curses in front of the enemy; descriptions that contradict the regularized relationship between officers and soldiers in the army (two soldiers searched for a long time to find the squad leader, the author described: "Calling the squad leader, what a pain in the ass, the two of us ran our legs off to find you, you head of garlic.") Such tendencies are everywhere, and indeed there are still some authors who do not think that these are bad tendencies that should be eliminated, and even feel complacent, boasting about it as rich life experience.

　　Where is the harm of these tendencies? Let us first review Zhdanov's "Report on the 'Star' and 'Leningrad' Magazines" in September 1946. He said:

　　Expressing these new and noble qualities of the Soviet people; expressing our people, not only their present, but also looking forward to their future; helping to illuminate the road forward like a searchlight – this is the task of every conscientious Soviet writer. The writer cannot be the tail of events, he should march in the vanguard of the people, pointing out the path of their development. Using socialist methods as a guide, conscientiously and carefully studying our reality, striving to penetrate deeper into the essence of our development process, the writer will surely educate the people and arm them ideologically. Praising the beautiful emotions and qualities of the Soviet people, showing them the tomorrow ahead... the younger generation should be educated to be firm, vigorous, unafraid of obstacles, welcoming these obstacles and being good at overcoming them. Our people should be educated and highly ideological people, and their cultural and moral demands and interests should be very high.

　　These teachings are of utmost importance to us. The task of literature and art is to express the new and noble qualities of the people, and to make the people more educated, more aware, and have "high cultural and moral demands and hobbies." But we have not yet removed the decaying dregs from our creative performances. Things that are being overcome or have even been overcome in the army are emphasized and promoted in our creative performances; the class consciousness of the troops has been improved and is becoming increasingly regularized, but we do not relax our one-sided portrayal of guerrilla habits, the lack of seriousness in implementing discipline, and a certain degree of extreme democratization; the cultural literacy of the troops is rapidly improving, and their social knowledge is enriched, but we do not relax our one-sided performance of ignorance, narrowness, and the habits and customs of small producers; the spirit of new heroism has been highly developed in the army, which is the noble character of proletarian collectivism, and the soldiers are washing away the influence of the morality and habits of the landlord class like washing away mud, vulgar and low-level tastes and hobbies, but we sometimes inevitably one-sidedly exaggerate these aspects that are about to be eliminated. Even if it is to reflect the historical situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan - the People's Liberation War, we should understand that it is not writing history for the sake of writing history, but continuing the past and opening up the future through recalling the glory of history, in order to benefit the construction of the troops today. Therefore, we should also not show those historical dregs and traces of lack of glory.

　　Many of our authors and actors do not fully understand that literature and art, in addition to being politically and ideologically beneficial to the people and the troops, should also be beneficial to the people and the troops in terms of moral cultivation. The heroes and new figures we portray should not only be made to move people with their deeds, but also focus on describing new elements in language and details, so that the characters are more prominent and more fleshed out, and have a greater infectious power on the audience, at least they should not damage the heroes and new figures due to incorrect expression of language and details. However, we often insert some unhealthy, low-level taste language and behavior, inducing the audience to laugh loudly, and do not analyze the audience's various reactions in the theater from the perspective of ideological function, cheaply satisfying the so-called theatrical effect, catering to certain backward factors in the audience's tastes and habits that have not been eliminated. Some people even think that this kind of depiction is to strengthen the drama, to highlight the character, and to make the performance realistic... In fact, this is the remaining poison of formalism, and it is a bad tendency that violates the realistic creative method.

　　Why does the tendency of not being able to create the image of soldiers seriously and accurately arise? The main reason is that the class viewpoint of the authors and actors is not clear enough, the attitude and view of the soldiers are not correct enough, and the correct artistic thinking and style have not been completely and solidly established. Therefore, abandoning the essential and pursuing the superficial cannot solve the problem.

　　As mentioned earlier, those one-sided performances of ignorance and vulgar low-level phenomena are not only due to the low political level and insufficient life experience of the authors and actors, but also express an unclear position. The vast majority of our soldiers are of peasant origin. They were subjected to feudal class oppression for a long time in old China, resulting in low cultural levels, narrow vision, and emotional tastes that were influenced by feudal consciousness. However, after they underwent land reform, joined the army, received Marxist-Leninist education, and experienced the test of war, they have undergone great changes in their thinking, style, and cultural accomplishment. The influence of the old society has only left remnants, and they are gradually disappearing remnants. If our authors and actors cannot see their main aspects, but first see their shortcomings, and do not adopt the attitude of kindly educating and helping them, but instead regard these remaining weaknesses as interesting, and exaggerate them in their works or performances as embellishments of character creation, even if the main description is the new appearance of the characters, they cannot be determined to abandon the above details. No matter what, it cannot be said that the class viewpoint of these authors and actors is not clear enough. Here we should also review Chairman Mao's teachings to us:

　　...Along with the standpoint comes our specific attitude towards various specific things. For example, praise? Or expose? This is a matter of attitude. ...As for the masses of the people, the labor and struggle of the people, the people's army, and the people's political parties, we should of course praise them. The people also have shortcomings, and many people in the proletariat still retain the ideas of the petty bourgeoisie. Peasants and the petty bourgeoisie both have backward ideas, which are the burden on their shoulders in the struggle. We should educate them patiently for a long time and help them get rid of the burden on their backs so that they can move forward with great strides. They have already transformed themselves or are transforming themselves in the struggle. Our literature and art should describe this transformation process, and should not only see one side and wrongly ridicule them, or even be hostile to them. What we write should be to unite them, to make them progress, to make them work together with one heart and one mind, to fight forward, to remove backward things, and to promote revolutionary things, and not the opposite. (Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art)

　　Another reason is that they have not studied the principles and lines of army building enough, and they do not have a very clear understanding of the current work of the army. Therefore, the phenomena of both good and bad being mixed together occur in the works, making those detailed descriptions that are harmful to the current work damage or weaken the theme of the work.

　　From the perspective of the author's and actor's artistic cultivation, appreciation taste, and aesthetic point of view, they have not completely broken away from the artistic influence of the bourgeoisie and the feudal class. Exaggerating details that are irrelevant to the theme, emphasizing certain "drama," not considering whether it is harmful to the theme and characters; passively catering to the tastes of a small number of backward audiences, not actively improving the audience's appreciation level, mechanically imitating life without analyzing, concentrating, and refining; some authors and actors have low cultural literacy and have not criticized their old emotional tastes; they cannot more deeply explore and express the spiritual state and inner struggle process of the characters, so they have to resort to external forms. This kind of creative method and aesthetic viewpoint is also what urgently needs to be overcome in our performing arts.

　　Let us strive to create the image of soldiers seriously and accurately, to create new heroic images, and to exert a stronger fighting force in literary and artistic work!

　　严肃准确地创造战士形象
    侯金镜
    去年十二月中，华北军区炮兵部队政治部文工团在首都抗美援朝文艺作品观摩晚会上，演出了《握紧手中枪》歌剧，虽然由于排演时间短促，不免有些粗糙，不过它的主题思想是尖锐的，有些情节是动人的，在全军热烈展开的抗美援朝的运动中间，演出这个剧本是适合时宜的。
    但是演出以后，首都文化界和文艺界的同志们提出了许多意见，大家都以为有些演员歪曲了战士的形象，把存在于旧日农民中间的落后、愚昧的因素——在今天农民中间已在迅速改变着的因素，无批判地不加选择地搬到舞台上来，尤其是有的演员极力夸张了吐痰的动作，这样不但不能从本质方面去表现一个人民解放军战士的生活，而且反而把战士表现得缺乏政治素养和文化素养。炮政文工团的同志们虚心地听取了这些意见，并且进行了研究和检查，一致认为这样的倾向是有害的，应该加以克服。
    这一倾向在华北部队其它各个文工团队中间，也是或多或少地存在着的。
    我们表现干部、英雄及先进分子常常干瘪无力。而表现一般的战士却常常是趣味庸俗、语言低级、缺乏教养。尤其是处理思想上还存在有缺点的人物，把缺点夸张到离开了现实生活的基础，不像是在部队里薰陶成长起来的人物。创作演出过程中进行细节描写以前，在作者、演员、导演的脑子里涌现出来的生动而具体的生活，常常是农民出身的战士那种已经克服了和正在克服着的愚昧和散漫的一面；而正在生长，正在向前进步着的人民解放军新的高贵的品德，在他们脑子里则往往成为暗淡无光，十分概念。对进步面既缺乏深入地体会了解，而在思想上又常常偏爱落后面，以为生动有趣，就突出而且夸张地表现出来。
    如果注意来寻找，是不难发现许多具体例子的：如炊事员，这些对部队战斗和训练的物质保证起着重要作用的人物，他们艰苦、朴素、任劳任怨，有些年岁较大的炊事员，他们有着诙谐的富有风趣的性格，他们关心战士，战士也尊敬他们。但是在舞台上表现他们的时候，却常常是强调肮脏（围裙、脸上、手上），政治觉悟低，成为战士们打趣取笑的对象。《战斗里成长》里的老齐，在华北军区文工团演出的时候，演员似乎就着重表现这一方面，而对剧本里面规定的勇于上战场，像老父亲一样关心战士的方面，就被削弱了（剧本本身也是有缺点的）。可笑的成分超过了使人尊敬的成分，优秀的品质被插科打诨遮盖了。
    华北空军政治部文工团和华北军区文工团联合演出的《冲破黎明前的黑暗》一剧中，也有不少同样的例子：区小队晚上住在一个村子里，有一个放哨的战士想吸烟了，就离开了自己的岗位，故意闹了个假情况，把大家弄醒要烟叶，这是夸张了游击习气，歪曲了生活，损害了人物；最后一场老大娘将鸡蛋慰劳战士们，战士们因为要遵守群众纪律不能接受，可是同时又强调了极其想吃，口水都要滴下来的样子，结果把纪律观念的自觉性和严肃性变成了儿戏；大家身上发痒，为了描写虱子之多，就表现各种各样的搔痒，各种各样的捉法；突围出来的时候，身上带着手巾，却把单帽拿下来擦汗，损害了战士们英勇、坚定、果敢的素质……，有一些在后来几次演出中改正了，但是认识还很不够，有的还没有认识，因此也没有改正。
    天津警备政治部文工团创作演出的《警惕》，描写如何转变一个班长的官僚主义作风和提高对反革命分子的警惕性。为了刻划班长的缺点，就强调了战士因为有意见就哓哓不休，吵吵嚷嚷一直到班长认识、改变了缺点。为了突出领导上的缺点，就不加批评地描写了极端民主化的作风，减轻了作品的现实性，使后来全班的团结进步的转变缺乏力量。这一点，作者和演员恐怕也还没有深刻的认识。
    在其他文工团队创作演出中间，存在着的，如：庸俗的趣味（家属来了，大家恶劣地开玩笑），语言的低级，尤其是有些恶劣不堪的歇后语；描写宁死不屈的英雄，在敌人面前一定要有一连串肮脏的咒骂；与部队正规化的官兵关系相抵触的描写（两个战士找了半天才把班长找到，作者描写道：“叫班长，真操蛋，我俩跑断腿，才找到你这头蒜。”）这样的倾向比比皆是，而且的确也还有些作者并不以为这些都是应该肃清的不良倾向，甚至于还沾沾自喜，把它当做生活丰富来炫耀。
    这些倾向的危害性在什么地方？让我们先温习一下日丹诺夫在一九四六年九月“关于‘星’与‘列宁格勒’两杂志的报告”吧。他说：
    表现苏联人这些新的崇高的品质；表现我们的人民，但不只是他们的今天，也要展望他们的明天；帮助像探照灯一样照亮前进的道路，——这就是每个有良心的苏联作家的任务。作家不能作事变的尾巴，他应当在人民先进行列中行进，给人民指出他们发展的道路。以社会主义的方法为指针，有良心地和仔细地研究我们的现实，力图更深地透入我们发展过程的本质，作家就一定会教育人民，在思想上武装人民。表扬苏联人美好的情感和品质，展示他们前面的明天，……年青的一代应当教育成坚定不移、生气勃勃、不怕阻碍、迎接这些阻碍并善于克服它们。我们的人们应当是有教养的和有崇高思想的人，而且文化和道德的要求与兴趣都应当很高。
    这些教导对我们是有着极其重要的意义的。文学艺术的任务是要表现人民的新的崇高的品质，而且使人民变得更有教养，觉悟更高，有着“高度的文化的道德的要求与爱好”。而我们却还没有从自己的创作演出中清除腐朽的渣滓。部队中正在克服甚至已经克服了的东西，我们的创作演出中间却加以强调和发扬；部队的阶级觉悟提高了，日益正规化，我们却不放松地片面描写游击习气，执行纪律缺乏严肃性，某种程度的极端民主化；部队的文化素养飞速的提高着，社会知识丰富了，而我们却不放松地片面表现愚昧、狭隘，小生产者的作风和习惯；部队高度地发扬了新英雄主义的精神，这是无产阶级的集体主义的高贵的品德，战士们正在像冲洗污泥般地去掉地主阶级的道德和习惯的影响，庸俗低级的趣味与爱好，而我们有时却不免片面地夸张这些即将被肃清的一方面。即使是反映抗日战争——人民解放战争的历史情况也罢，也应该懂得不是为写历史而写历史，而是通过回忆历史的光荣，继往开来，以有利于今天部队的建设。因而同样不应该表现那些历史上的渣滓，缺乏光彩的陈迹。
    我们有许多作者和演员还不完全懂得文学艺术，除了在政治思想上有益于人民，有益于部队以外，还要在品德教养上有益于人民，有益于部队。我们所刻划的英雄和新的人物不仅是使其事迹感动人，而且在言语和细节上也应着力描写新的因素，使人物更突出，更有血肉，对观众有更大的感染力量，至少也不应当因为语言和细节的不正确表现损害了英雄和新的人物。但是我们却常常插入些不健康的低级趣味语言和行为，逗引观众轰然一笑，对观众在剧场中的各种反映不从思想作用上加以分析，廉价地满足于所谓剧场效果，迁就观众中在趣味和习惯方面某些没有被肃清的落后因素。甚至有些人以为这样的描写就是加强戏剧性，就是人物性格的突出，表现的逼真……实际上，这便是形式主义的遗毒，是违反现实主义创作方法的不良倾向。
    为什么会产生不能严肃准确地创造战士形象的倾向呢？主要的还是在于作者和演员的阶级观点不够明确，对战士的态度和看法不够端正，正确的艺术思想和作风没有完全巩固地树立起来。因此，舍本逐末，是不能解决问题的。
    如前面所举的那些片面地表现愚昧与庸俗低级的现象，这不只是作者，演员政治水平不高，生活体验不够，而也是表现了立场不明确。我们的战士绝大多数都是农民出身的，他们在旧中国长时期经受着封建阶级压迫，造成了文化水平低下，眼光狭窄，感情趣味上也受着封建意识的影响，但是在他们经过土地改革，参加了部队，受到马列主义的教育，经过了战争的考验，他们在思想作风和文化素养上都有了很大的改变，旧社会给予他们的影响，就只剩下了残余，而且是逐渐消失着的残余。如果我们的作者和演员不能看到他们主要方面，而首先看到了他们的缺点，又不是采取善意地教育帮助他们的态度，相反地却把这些残存的弱点当做有趣，在作品或表演中间加以夸张，成为人物创造的点缀，即或是主要的描写了人物的新面貌，但却不能决心舍弃了上述的细节，无论怎样，也不能不说这一些作者和演员的阶级观点是不够十分明确的。在这里我们还应该重温一下毛主席对我们的教导：
    ……随着立场，就发生我们对于各种具体事物所采取的具体态度。譬如说，歌颂呢？还是暴露呢？这就是态度问题。……至于对人民群众，对人民的劳动和斗争，对人民的军队，人民的政党，我们当然应该赞扬。人民也有缺点的，无产阶级中还有许多人保留着小资产阶级的思想。农民与小资产阶级都有落后的思想，这些就是他们在斗争中的负担，我们应该长期地耐心地教育他们，帮助他们摆脱其背上的包袱，使他们能够大踏步前进。他们在斗争中已经改造或正在改造自己，我们的文艺应该描写他们的这个改造过程，而不应该只看到片面就去错误地讥笑他们，甚至敌视他们。我们所写的东西，应该是使他们团结，使他们进步，使他们同心同德，向前奋斗，去掉落后的东西，发扬革命的东西，而决不是相反。（延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）
    还有一个原因，是对建军原则建军路线的学习不够，对部队当前工作也了解得不十分清楚，不能够区分那些是应该加以扶持和发扬的，那些是应该改变和克服的。于是在作品里就发生糟粕与精华杂然并陈的现象，使那些对当前工作有害的细节描写，损害了或是削弱了作品的主题。
    从作者、演员的艺术修养、欣赏趣味和审美观点上来看，还没有从资产阶级和封建阶级的艺术影响中完全摆脱出来。夸张与主题无关的细节，强调某些“戏剧性”，不考虑对主题与人物有没有损害；消极地迎合少数落后观众的趣味，不从积极方面来提高观众的欣赏水平，机械地模仿生活，而不加以分析、集中和提炼；有些作者和演员的文化素养不高，对自己旧的感情趣味也没有加以批判；不能更深入地发掘与表现人物的精神状态、内心斗争过程，就不得不求助于外形。这样的创作方法与审美观点亦正是在我们的表演艺术中亟需克服的。
    严肃准确地创造战士的形象，为创作新的英雄的形象，为发挥文艺工作更强烈的战斗力量而努力吧！
