　　Southwest Military and Administrative Committee Closes Second Meeting
    Resolves to Basically Complete Land Reform Work This Year
    [By Our Own Correspondent] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Second Plenary Meeting of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, lasting five days, successfully concluded on the 29th of last month.
    This meeting focused on discussing the plan to basically complete land reform work in the Southwest Region in 1951. The meeting unanimously agreed that some areas in the Southwest already have the conditions, and some areas are developing the conditions, to implement land reform, and that it is entirely possible to basically complete land reform work in the entire region in 1951. Currently, the situation in the Southwest Region is: bandits throughout the region, except in remote mountainous areas, have been basically eliminated. Since the launch of the social reform movement of rent reduction, etc., in the entire region last November, more than ten million peasants have joined peasant associations, three million peasant activists have been trained and participated in peasant representative meetings, and a million young and middle-aged peasants have joined militia organizations. Peasants who have initially turned themselves over through the rent reduction movement have already made land reform demands to the People's Government; in areas with mixed ethnic groups, ethnic minorities have also made land reform demands.
    Four administrative regions, including East Sichuan, have each selected several villages in counties where rent reduction has been completed to conduct pilot land reform work. The land reform experiment in Sancha Township, Dayi County, West Sichuan Region, has been completed with good results.
    The meeting believes that due to the success of the land reform experimental work, it is absolutely necessary and possible to accelerate the implementation of land reform in the entire region. In areas with mixed ethnic groups, the meeting decided that the demands for rent reduction and land reform put forward by ethnic minorities should be respected. In places where ethnic autonomous regions or joint ethnic governments have been established, ethnic minority people should be permitted to implement rent reduction or land reform after the vast majority agree and the local people's representative meeting approves.
    The meeting approved the seven work tasks for the Southwest Region in 1951: (1) Expand and deepen the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country; (2) Advance into Tibet and consolidate national defense; (3) Accelerate the completion of land reform work; (4) Continue to stabilize prices and develop industry, commerce, and agriculture; (5) Continue to suppress counter-revolutionary activities and protect state secrets; (6) Strengthen cultural and educational work and organize learning movements; (7) Further consolidate unity and strengthen the people's democratic united front.

　　西南军政委员会第二次会议闭幕
    决议今年基本完成土改工作
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西南军政委员会第二次全体会议历时五日，已于上月二十九日圆满闭幕。
    这次会议着重讨论了西南区在一九五一年基本上完成土地改革工作的计划。会议一致认为：西南有些地区已经具备和有些地区正在具备实行土地改革的条件，全区在一九五一年基本上完成土地改革工作是完全可能的。目前，西南区的情况是：全区土匪除边缘山区外，业已基本肃清。自去年十一月全区展开减租等社会改革运动以来，已有一千万以上的农民加入了农民协会，三百万农民积极分子受过训练和参加过农民代表会议，百万青壮年农民参加了民兵组织。经过减租运动初步翻身的农民们，已向人民政府提出了土地改革的要求；在民族杂居的地区，少数民族也提出了土地改革的要求。
    川东等四个行政区，已各在减租完毕的县份，选择若干乡村试办土地改革工作。川西区大邑县三岔乡土地改革实验已经完毕，成绩良好。
    会议认为：由于土地改革实验工作的成功，加速实行全区土地改革是完全必需和可能的。在民族杂居地区，会议决定：应尊重少数民族所提出的减租和土地改革的要求。在民族自治区或各民族联合政府已经成立的地方，少数民族人民绝大多数赞成并经当地人民代表会议通过后，准许实行减租或土地改革。
    会议通过了西南区一九五一年的七项工作任务是：（一）扩大与深入抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动；（二）进军西藏，巩固国防；（三）加速完成土地改革工作；（四）继续稳定物价，发展工商业和农业；（五）继续镇压反革命活动，保守国家机密；（六）加强文教工作，组织学习运动；（七）进一步巩固团结，加强人民民主统一战线。
