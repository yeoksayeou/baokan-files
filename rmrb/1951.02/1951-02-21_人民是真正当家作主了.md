　　"The People Are Truly Masters of Their Own House"
    To the Editor:
    In January 1951, we wrote to the People's Daily, offering our opinions on the Central People's Supervisory Committee's handling of the Lin Jie policy violation case.

    On January 28th, we received a letter from the Central People's Supervisory Committee, inviting Yu Yi to represent us at a symposium. At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Muyao, Director of the First Bureau of the Central People's Supervisory Committee, explained and reviewed the handling of the case and certain inappropriate aspects of the draft wording. He listened to our opinions with an open mind and patiently explained things to us. After Comrade Yu Yi returned, he told us about the spirit of the meeting, which gave us a clear understanding of the Central People's Supervisory Committee's handling of the Lin Jie case.

    This incident made us realize even more deeply that the People's Government truly serves the people and that the people are truly masters of their own house.

    To the Editor: From today onwards, we must pay more attention to the various tasks of the country, provide various opinions with a positive and responsible attitude, and build our great motherland.

　　“人民是真正当家作主了”
    编辑同志：
    一九五一年一月份，我们曾写信给人民日报，对中央人民监察委员会处理林洁违犯政策案提出意见：
    一月二十八日，我们就收到中央人民监察委员会来函，邀请于一代表我们参加座谈会。在会议上中央人民监察委员会第一厅厅长张慕尧同志对处理此案经过及拟稿文字上某些不恰当的地方，进行了说明和检讨，虚心地听取我们的意见，耐心地向我们解释。于一同志回来后，把会议精神告诉我们，使我们对中央人民监察委员会对林洁案的处理有了明确的认识。
    这件事情，使我们更深刻地认识到，人民政府是真正给人民办事的，人民是真正当家做主人了。
    编辑同志：从今天起，我们一定要更加关心国家的各项工作，以积极负责的态度提供各种意见，来建设我们的伟大祖国。
