Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Seoul, 1st— Our frontline reporter reports: After suffering three successive and devastating blows on the Korean battlefield at the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the U.S. aggressor troops still persist in their military adventurism in Korea. While the U.S. government forces a majority of the member states of the United Nations to reject peaceful negotiations, the U.S. aggressor troops have once again assembled their remnant forces of more than nine divisions and are advancing north along the Suwon-to-Seoul railway. These more than nine divisions are: the U.S. aggressor army's 9th Corps' 25th Division, 2nd Division, British 27th Brigade, remnants of the Turkish Brigade, U.S. 1st Corps' 1st Cavalry Division, 24th Division, British 29th Brigade, Greek troops, and the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 1st and 6th Divisions, totaling more than 100,000 troops. From January 25th to 31st, the U.S. aggressor troops, under the cover of hundreds of aircraft, thousands of artillery pieces, and hundreds of tanks, launched fierce attacks on the bridgehead positions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the south bank of the Han River. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who have achieved great victories in the three campaigns, are extremely high in morale and are putting up a stubborn resistance. Although the scale of the U.S. aggressor troops' offensive is very large, their progress is minimal under the heroic resistance of the Korean and Chinese fighters fighting shoulder to shoulder. In the past seven days, the enemy has only captured our outpost positions.
In order to conceal its offensive deployment and scale, the U.S. aggressor troops have publicly reported their main attack direction as "reconnaissance activities," while at the same time vigorously publicizing the "battle results" of the U.S. 10th Corps and the Rhee puppet army's 1st and 3rd Corps' movements in the Wonju and Jecheon areas. This foolish and despicable conspiracy has been completely seen through by our army.
According to prisoners of war, before the launch of this offensive, MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea, personally went to Daegu to make deployments, and then went to Suwon on January 28th to supervise the battle. Although this warmonger has suffered three defeats in a row, it seems that he has not learned any lessons from the failures. If one were to ask what the outcome of this offensive by the U.S. aggressor troops will be, people can find the answer in the outcome of the "Christmas General Offensive" launched by MacArthur last year.

　　侵朝美军坚持军事冒险
    纠合残部再度北犯       
    所谓“停战”阴谋真相毕露
    【新华社汉城前线一日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上遭到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军接连三次的惨重打击后，仍坚持其对于朝鲜的军事冒险。在美国政府强迫联合国的多数会员国拒绝和平谈判的同时，美国侵略军又纠合其残部九个多师，沿水原至汉城铁路向北进犯。这九个多师就是：美国侵略军第九兵团之第二十五师、第二师、英军二十七旅、土耳其旅残部，美第一兵团之骑一师、二十四师、英二十九旅、希腊部队及李承晚伪军第一、第六两师共十余万人。自一月二十五日到三十一日止，美国侵略军每日以数百架飞机、数千门大炮和数百辆坦克掩护，向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在汉江南岸的桥头阵地猛犯。取得三次战役伟大胜利的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，士气极为旺盛，奋起顽强抗击。美国侵略军进攻规模虽然很大，但在朝中战士并肩英勇的抵抗下，进展极微。敌人在过去七天中仅占取了我前哨阵地。
    美国侵略军为掩盖其进攻部署及规模，将其主攻方向公开报道为“侦察活动”，同时又大肆宣传美军第十兵团及李伪军第一、第三兵团在原州、堤川一线蠢动之“战果”。此种愚笨而可耻的阴谋，已完全为我军所洞察。
    据俘虏供称：此次进攻发起前，侵朝美军总司令麦克阿瑟曾亲至大邱部署，继又于一月二十八日亲赴水原督战。这个战争贩子虽然接连吃了三次败仗，可是看起来并没有从失败中得到什么教训。若要问美国侵略军此次进攻的结果如何？人们可以从去年麦克阿瑟所发动的“圣诞节总攻势”的结果中找到答案。
