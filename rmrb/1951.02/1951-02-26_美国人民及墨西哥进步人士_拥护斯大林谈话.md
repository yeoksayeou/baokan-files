　　American People and Mexican Progressives
　  Endorse Stalin's Remarks
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 23rd, TASS dispatch: Stalin's interview with a Pravda reporter has been met with enthusiastic response and support from the broad masses of the American people.
    The Detroit Workers' Daily reported that reporters from several newspapers visited residents in a certain district of the city. The reporters asked residents: "What are your opinions on Stalin's statement that war is not inevitable, and that Americans should withdraw from Korea and hold peace talks?" Everyone interviewed by the reporters welcomed Stalin's words and expressed their desire for peace. The newspaper quoted many typical statements: "We must withdraw from Korea. It's best to hold a meeting and start peace talks." "We all need peace. I think all foreign troops should leave Korea. We must resolve all differences through negotiations." "I think Korea is none of our business... We have no reason to intrude into that place, and we have no reason to send our children to make meaningless sacrifices." In their conversations with reporters, Detroit residents protested against the aggressive foreign policy of the American reactionary groups, and pointed out that big business tycoons regard war as a way to make a fortune.
    A Workers' Daily reporter reported from High Point, North Carolina, that 150 residents of the state—representatives from religious, business, and labor union circles—sent an open letter to Truman on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The writers of the letter also asked the U.S. government to support the International Committee of the Red Cross's appeal for an international agreement banning atomic and bacteriological weapons and means of mass destruction.
    The Workers' Daily also reported widespread support from the American people for the "Peace Petition to Washington" scheduled for March 1st. The American Peace Crusade organization said that thousands of groups and individuals inquired about the information they needed regarding the peace petition.
    American newspapers published many facts illustrating the increasing number of people protesting against the militarization of the United States, especially protesting against inciting war psychology in schools.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a Teletype News Agency Mexico City, February 23rd dispatch: Stalin's remarks have resonated among Mexican progressives. General Yala, former Minister of the Navy, participant in drafting the Mexican Constitution, and former representative of President Cárdenas at the Warsaw World Peace Congress, told our reporter: "The enemies of peace and the Mexican newspapers are trying to distort the truth, saying that Stalin insulted Mexico. However, it is a fact that Latin America voted in the United Nations to declare China an aggressor. Stalin's statement merely points out the current situation within the United Nations, pointing out that the United States has turned it into a tool for implementing its war policy."
    Former Minister of Education and Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bounton, said: "The most noteworthy point in the talk is: Stalin emphasized that the Soviet Union is not preparing for war. The economic plans carried out by the Soviet Union and the fair reports from the Soviet Union all prove that the Soviet people are committed to peace work. I believe Stalin's talk is helpful to peace. First, because it gives many people information that the American and British news agencies never publish; second, because it shows that the crisis of aggression does not come from the Soviet Union."
    The famous painter Siqueiros said: "The actions of the representatives of the Latin American countries in the United Nations are like those of people who have sold their souls to the devil. I believe what Stalin said is correct."

　　美国人民及墨西哥进步人士
　  拥护斯大林谈话
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：斯大林对真理报记者的谈话得到了广大美国人民的热烈响应与拥护。
    工人日报底特律消息称：若干报纸的记者曾访问该城某区的居民。记者们问居民：“你对于斯大林所说战争并不是不可避免的以及美国人应自朝鲜撤退与举行和平谈判这些话有什么意见？”凡是经记者访问过的人们都欢迎斯大林的这些话，并且表示对和平的愿望。该报引述了许多典型的话：“我们必须自朝鲜撤退。最好举行一个会议，开始进行和平谈判”。“我们都需要和平。我认为，一切外国军队应该离开朝鲜。我们必须经由谈判来解决一切分歧的意见”。“我认为朝鲜是与我们不相干的事……。我们没有理由闯入那个地方，我们也没有理由叫我们的孩子们去作无谓的牺牲”。底特律居民在对记者们谈话时对美国反动集团的侵略外交政策表示抗议，并指出：大企业家们把战争视为大发横财的门路。
    工人日报记者自北卡罗来纳州海邦发来的报道说，该州有一百五十个居民——宗教界、商界及工会方面的代表——就和平解决朝鲜问题给了杜鲁门一封公开信。写这封信的人们也要求美国政府支持红十字会国际委员会的呼吁，缔结关于禁止原子与细菌武器以及大规模毁灭性手段的国际协定。
    工人日报也报道了美国人民对定于三月一日“到华盛顿去的和平请愿”的广泛支持。美国和平十字军组织说，成千的团体与个人询问他们所需要的关于和平请愿的消息。
    美国报纸登载了许多事实说明抗议美国军国主义化的人越来越多了，他们尤其抗议在学校中煽动战争心理。
    【新华社讯】据电通社墨西哥二十三日讯：斯大林的谈话在墨西哥进步人士中激起了共鸣。曾任海军部长、参加起草墨西哥宪法、并曾代表前任总统卡德纳斯参加华沙世界保卫和平大会的雅拉将军对本社记者说：“和平的敌人和墨西哥的报纸，正力图颠倒是非，说斯大林侮辱了墨西哥。但是，拉丁美洲在联合国中投票宣布中国为侵略者是事实，斯大林的声明不过是指出联合国内的目前情形，指出美国已经把它变成执行战争政策的一个工具而已。”
    前任教育部长及驻苏大使邦顿说：“谈话中最引人注意的一点是：斯大林着重指出苏联并不在备战。苏联所进行的经济计划以及来自苏联的公正报道都证明：苏联人民在致力于和平工作。我相信斯大林的谈话有助于和平。第一，因为它使许许多多的人获得了美英通讯社素来不发表的消息；第二，因为它表明侵略的危机并非来自苏联。”
    著名画家西圭罗斯说：“拉丁美洲各国驻联合国的代表们的行动，就像已把灵魂出卖给恶魔的人一样。我相信斯大林说的话是正确的。”
