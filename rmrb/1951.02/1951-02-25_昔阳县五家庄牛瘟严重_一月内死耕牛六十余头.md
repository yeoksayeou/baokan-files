    Serious Cattle Plague in Wujiadzhuang, Xiyang County
    Over Sixty Head of Cattle Die in One Month
    Recently, a serious cattle plague has broken out in some areas of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, causing great losses to rural productivity. Li Zhuanzai, a farmer from Wujiazhunag Village, Sixth District of the county, bought three head of cattle from Heshun County before the Spring Festival in preparation for spring plowing. However, several days after returning to the village, one head died from the plague. At the time, it did not attract attention, and it quickly spread throughout the village. After it was discovered, local veterinarians were organized to treat the cattle, but with little effect. Out of the village's seventy-seven head of cattle, over sixty died in just over twenty days. According to the veterinarian's examination, only four head of cattle were not infected with the cattle plague. Similar symptoms have also begun to spread in the Xingdangu Village area of the First District of the county.
    The Xiyang County People's Government has now organized veterinarians to carry out prevention and treatment. It has been decided to implement strict isolation and blockade of villages with infected cattle and cattle plague to prevent transmission; and to mobilize the masses to carry out livestock epidemic prevention to protect livestock safety.
              Xiyang County People's Government Jin Qing
    Editor's Note: Since the beginning of spring, all localities are actively preparing for spring plowing. The huge losses caused by the spread of cattle plague in Wujiazhunag Village, Xiyang County, should serve as a serious warning to all localities. People's governments in all localities should pay attention to helping farmers carry out epidemic prevention for livestock.

    昔阳县五家庄牛瘟严重
    一月内死耕牛六十余头
    山西省昔阳县近月来，在部分地区发生了严重的牛瘟，致使农村生产力遭受极大损失。该县六区五家庄村农民李专财，春节前到和顺县买了三头牛、准备春耕。但是回村后数日即因得瘟病死掉一头。当时未引起注意，很快就传染到全村。经发现后，组织当地兽医进行治疗，收效甚微。全村七十七头耕牛，在二十多天中即死去六十余头。据兽医检查结果，只有四头牛没有传染上牛瘟。同样病症在该县一区邢单谷村一带亦开始蔓延。
    昔阳县人民政府现已组织了兽医进行预防和治疗。决定对有疫牛和牛瘟的村子实行严格隔离和封锁，以免传染；并发动群众进行牲畜防疫，保护牲畜的安全。
              昔阳县人民政府  进卿
    编者按：入春以来，各地正积极准备进行春耕。昔阳县五家庄村因牛瘟传染而造成的巨大损失，各地实应严重警惕。各地人民政府应注意帮助农民对牲畜进行防疫。
