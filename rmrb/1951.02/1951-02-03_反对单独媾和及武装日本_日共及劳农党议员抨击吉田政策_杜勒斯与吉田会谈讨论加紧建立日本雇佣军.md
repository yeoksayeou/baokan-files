　　Opposition to Separate Peace and Arming Japan
    Japanese Communist Party and Labor-Farmer Party Members Criticize Yoshida's Policies
    Dulles and Yoshida Discuss Intensifying the Establishment of Japanese Mercenaries
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's policy address on January 26th in the Diet, advocating a separate peace treaty, was attacked by members of democratic parties. According to a report from the Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, January 31st: Japanese Communist Party member Kanichi Kawakami, in a recent interpellation of Yoshida's policy address, declared: The majority of the Japanese people oppose a separate peace treaty and rearmament. He pointed out: Japan's budget has been used for the construction of military equipment; former war factories, in violation of the Potsdam Declaration, are producing large quantities of war materials; and the National Police Reserve Force is strengthening its equipment and learning to use American rocket launchers. Kawakami warned the Yoshida government "not to pull chestnuts out of the fire for imperialism." Because Kawakami made such a righteous interpellation, the Japanese Diet, controlled by Yoshida's Liberal Party with a majority of seats, decided to send Kawakami to the disciplinary committee, attempting to deprive him of his legitimate seat.
    Japanese Labor-Farmer Party member Hisao Kuroda, in his recent interpellation, also called for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty. Kuroda said: The rumored American plan for a Japanese peace treaty, regarding the determination of territory and the stationing of troops after the signing of the peace treaty, violates the agreements of the Cairo and Potsdam Conferences. He also said: "A comprehensive peace treaty including China and the Soviet Union is the only way for Japan to obtain independence and a peaceful life." He emphasized that the Asian liberation movement will inevitably win victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. He concluded by warning the Yoshida government not to turn Japan into a military base for aggressors.
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 1st] TASS reported from Tokyo on January 31st: Dulles is in Tokyo holding separate peace treaty talks with the Japanese government. Dulles, in his meeting with Yoshida on January 29th, presented the "principles" for concluding a peace treaty with Japan. According to Tokyo Radio, the Dulles-Yoshida talks were "entirely for a frank exchange of views between the two sides." After the two men met, MacArthur received them.
    Yoshida's speech in the Diet and numerous officially-sanctioned reports in Japanese newspapers and radio stations indicate that Dulles' trip to Tokyo, prompted by the crushing defeat of the American invading forces in Korea, aims to intensify the establishment of a Japanese mercenary army in the Far East. Tokyo Radio, in summarizing the results of Dulles' five-day stay in Tokyo, pointed out that Truman's special envoy said: If Japan automatically helps the "United Nations," the United States will do everything possible to ensure Japan's "security" and the consolidation of its civil administration. It is now universally known that the American imperialists are planning to carry out their predatory plans under the banner of the United Nations, as they have done in Korea. Therefore, Dulles has openly admitted in his talks that the United States intends to intensify the rearmament of Japan and use Japan to carry out American aggression in Asia. A separate peace treaty between the United States and Japan will help to implement Washington's plans, which are hostile to the cause of peace.
    Japanese militarists are applauding all the evil plans and conspiracies of the American imperialists. American puppet Yoshida, in his address to the Diet on January 26th, declared that the Japanese government "is re-examining the system of police and maritime security organizations in accordance with the current domestic and international situation." However, Yoshida admitted that the plans for re-militarization and Japan's participation on the side of the American aggressors in Korea are unpopular among the broad masses of the Japanese people, and he warned his colleagues: "When talking about rearmament, we should be careful."
    Apparently, Yoshida was thinking of his talks with Dulles when he made a suggestive statement, pointing out that Japan had reached a time when "it will play an important role in the struggle against communist aggression." In order to curry favor with the American warmongers, the leaders of the Japanese revanchists have expressed enthusiasm for the prospect of joining the American-led imperialist camp.
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd] Warmonger Dulles continues to discuss intensifying the rearmament of Japan and related issues with the Japanese reactionary group. Following the talks on January 29th, Dulles met with Yoshida again on January 31st. According to United Press International, this meeting "further clarified the issues raised in the first meeting." On the same day, Dulles also met with National Democratic Party representatives Yoshizo Tomabechi (chairman of the party's Supreme Committee) and Saburo Chiba (secretary-general of the party), listening to their statements "on issues such as rearmament, restoration of old territories, and security after the peace treaty." Dulles met with Japanese Social Democratic Party Chairman Saburo Suzuki and Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma on February 1st. According to Reuters, Suzuki and Asanuma stated that the party demanded a comprehensive peace treaty, opposed rearmament, and opposed the occupation of bases in Japan. Prior to this, Dulles had visited British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Gascoigne, on January 29th, "exchanging comprehensive views on the peace treaty issue." Dulles openly stated at the "America-Japan Society" on February 2nd that his activities were mainly to rearm Japan to serve as an instrument of American aggression. He said: "The peace treaty we want to conclude will enable Japan to have the opportunity to protect the integrity of the full sovereignty that the peace treaty will restore with its own strength, and to have the opportunity to participate in collective security against direct aggression."

　　反对单独媾和及武装日本
    日共及劳农党议员抨击吉田政策     
    杜勒斯与吉田会谈讨论加紧建立日本雇佣军
    【新华社二日讯】日本首相吉田茂于一月二十六日在国会发表的鼓吹单独媾和的施政演说，遭到民主政党议员的抨击。据电通社东京一月三十一日讯：日本共产党议员川上贯一在最近质询吉田的施政演说时宣称：大多数的日本人民反对单独和约和重新武装。他指出：日本的预算已被用于建设军备；以前的战争工厂违犯波茨坦公告的规定，正在生产大批战争物资；国家警察后备队在加强装备，并学习使用美国的火箭炮。川上贯一警告吉田政府“不要为帝国主义火中取栗”。因为川上贯一发表了这样正义的质询，由吉田的自由党操纵多数议席的日本国会，竟决定将川上贯一送交惩罚委员会，企图剥夺他合法的议席。
    日本劳农党议员黑田寿男，在他最近的质询中也呼吁缔结全面和约。黑田寿男说：传闻中的美国关于日本和约的计划，在领土的决定与和约签订后驻军这一方面，是违犯开罗和波茨坦会议的协定的。他又说：“包括中国和苏联在内的全面和约，是使日本获得独立及和平生活的唯一的道路。”他着重指出：亚洲的解放运动在反帝国主义斗争中必然会赢得胜利。他在结语中警告吉田政府不要把日本变为侵略者的军事基地。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社一月三十一日电引东京消息：杜勒斯正在东京和日本政府进行单独媾和会谈。杜勒斯在一月二十九日和吉田会谈时，曾提出缔结对日和约的《原则》。据东京电台广播，杜勒斯、吉田的会谈，“完全是为了双方坦白地交换意见”。两人会谈之后，麦克阿瑟就接见了他们。
    吉田在议会中的演说以及日本报纸和电台的许多经官方授意的报道表明：因美国侵略军在朝鲜遭受惨败而引起的杜勒斯的东京之行，其目的是在远东加紧建立一支日本雇佣军。东京电台在综述杜勒斯在东京逗留五天的结果时指出：杜鲁门的这个专使曾说：如果日本自动帮助“联合国”的话，美国将尽一切努力保证日本的“安全”和它的民政当局的巩固。现在举世皆知：美帝国主义者正在打算在联合国旗帜之下执行其掠夺的计划，一如他们在朝鲜所做的那样。因此，杜勒斯在他的谈话中已坦白承认美国打算加紧重新武装日本，并利用日本进行美国在亚洲的侵略活动。美国和日本缔结单独和约，将会有助于执行华盛顿的这些与和平事业为敌的计划。
    日本军国主义者对于美帝国主义者的一切罪恶的计划和阴谋都是拍手欢迎的。美国傀儡吉田于一月二十六日在议会致词时曾宣称：日本政府“正按照目前的国内与国际局势来重新审查警察与海上保安组织的制度”。不过，吉田承认：重新军国主义化与日本参加在朝鲜的美国侵略者一方的计划，在日本广大人民群众中间是不得民心的，他警告他的同僚说：“在谈论重新武装的时候，应当小心谨慎。”
    显然，吉田脑子里想到他与杜勒斯的会谈，他作了一个具有暗示性的声明，指出日本已到了“它将在反对共产主义侵略的斗争中起重要作用”的时候。为了谄媚美国战争贩子们，日本复仇主义者的首领们对参加以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的前途已经表示热心了。
    【新华社二日讯】战争贩子杜勒斯继续与日本反动集团讨论加紧重新武装日本及其有关问题。继一月二十九日的会谈之后，杜勒斯又于一月三十一日与吉田再度会谈。据合众社透露，这次会谈曾“进一步解释了第一次会议中所提出的各项问题”。同日，杜勒斯并曾与国民民主党的代表苫米地义三（该党最高委员会主席）、千叶三郎（该党干事长）等五人会谈，听取他们申述“关于重新武装、恢复旧有领土及和约后的安全等问题的意见”。杜勒斯于二月一日与日本社会民主党主席铃木三郎与总书记浅沼稻次郎会谈。据路透社称，铃木和浅沼声明该党要求全面和约、反对重新武装、反对在日占有基地。在此以前，杜勒斯又曾于一月二十九日访问英国驻日代表团团长盖斯考尼，“对和约问题交换了全盘的意见”。杜勒斯在二日“美日协会”上露骨地表明，他的活动主要是重新武装日本以充当美国的侵略工具。他说：“我们所想订立的和约是将使日本能有机会以它自己的力量保护和约所将恢复的充分主权的完整，能有机会参加集体安全以反抗直接的侵略”。
