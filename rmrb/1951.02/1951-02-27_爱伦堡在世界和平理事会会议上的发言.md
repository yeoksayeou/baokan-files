Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 24th: The full text of Ehrenburg's speech at the afternoon session of the World Peace Council on February 22nd is as follows:

　　We left Warsaw with satisfaction, seeing that our strength had grown, that the people would not be unknowingly manipulated by a handful of demons or madmen, and that the noble institution for defending life—the World Peace Council—had been established. Three months have passed. Our joy at the growth of the peace movement is not misplaced. The voices of honest Americans are increasing and becoming stronger, warning their compatriots of the dangerous gamble their rulers are undertaking. However, the stronger the movement for peace becomes, the more frantic the hateful gamble becomes. The awakening of reason and conscience has terrified the warmongers, and they have become even more frantic. The situation in Korea is their preview. Failure has not sobered them. Those who shamelessly demand in broad daylight the bombing of China, the use of atomic bombs, and the initiation of a third world war are not lunatics in an asylum, but members of a representative body of a great nation. They are prepared not only to drive their own youth but also the flower of Europe onto the battlefield. They are buying human flesh and blood on the world market, just as their ancestors once bought wool or mineral seedlings.

　　The international organization that was established thanks to the perseverance of the Soviet people, the heroism of European guerrillas, and the great efforts of ordinary people in Britain and the United States, an organization to which people all over the world placed their hopes five years ago, has now been turned by them into a stage in the backwoods, with audiences consisting of simple-minded people from Mississippi or Oklahoma. We see some people crossing oceans with evil conspiracies and permeating a distant foreign land with the blood of children, yet they are shouting: "Help! We are being attacked!" One might think that children from American schools traveled to Korea and were abused by insidious masters. One might think that the Chinese occupied San Francisco and dropped bombs on Texas. One might think that the Yalu River flows through Michigan, and unarmed American girls were attacked by brutal Chinese while resting on its banks. This is not a joke, it is hateful. The warmongers are trying to cover the blood-stained dagger with a piece of blue cloth.

　　They are preparing unprecedented massacres, with nothing in sight: they are planting mines on bridges in Germany, recruiting pitiful demons from Colombia, they are testing atomic bombs in Nevada, and testing the loyalty of their European vassals in Brussels. They put on sheep's clothing, and frightened Chile or the Netherlands hastily write their signatures, letting the murderers of people run amok.

　　The chairman of the fascist German Imperial Party recently said in Braunschweig: "The primary responsibility of the German people is to restore the honor of the SS. General MacArthur's troops destroyed entire villages along with women and children, so now no one has the right to condemn us anymore." Yes, the American warmongers have revived Hitler's deeds. Seeing this, who would be surprised that they are trying to revive Hitler's army!

　　The fate of this country, in whose capital we are meeting, is not only a source of concern for Germans, but the eyes of the whole world are focused on Germany. This can be explained by geography: before us is a country located in the very center of Europe, arbitrarily divided into two parts. Beyond its borders are two worlds, whose peaceful coexistence is not recognized by the war instigators, and half of this country has become a bridgehead for military operations. The reason why the people of the whole world are concerned about the future of Germany can also be explained by history: Germany has repeatedly interfered in the fate of other countries, and its soldiers have repeatedly crossed foreign borders. People often ask: "What will the Germans do in the future?" or ask: "What to do with the Germans?" People everywhere recognize that if Germany is pulled into a military alliance, the danger of war will increase. People also recognize that if Germany does not participate in such an alliance, then war instigators will have to think carefully before moving from threats to firing the fatal first shot.

　　Some may ask me why I speak of Germany in general terms. Yes, there are two different Germanys. Of course, I know that those who lead the German Democratic Republic are different from those who declared Bonn the capital of the second Germany. I know that while the Berlin Parliament is passing laws to protect peace, the Bonn government ministers are negotiating to bring West Germany into a military alliance. But if I seem to ignore temporary borders when I speak of the fate of Germany, it is only because I cannot separate the fate of the country from the fate of the people.

　　The residents of Frankfurt on the Main and the residents of Frankfurt on the Oder have experienced the same times of prosperity and decline, created the same precious things, committed the same mistakes, and lived a common life. These people were not born yesterday, and they did not learn yesterday that they are unified. Germany, like every country where social contradictions still exist, has internal dividing lines; this line is not along the Elbe River, nor along any other river, it exists in every city, it separates Mr. Krupp's villa from his workers' homes. But are there not also two Frances - one signing military pacts and the other demanding peace? ... Forgive me, I am not speaking of the fate of Frankfurt on the Main, nor of the fate of Frankfurt on the Oder, but of the fate of Germany.

　　We have heard the arguments of diplomats, the disputes of lawyers on issues of international law, and the debates of politicians. I am not a diplomat, nor a lawyer, nor a politician. I would like to look at the German problem as someone who has experienced everything that my contemporaries have experienced. I want to speak bluntly and directly, discarding the pleasantries - pleasantries are often more rude than the truth. The question of the future of Germany is a complex and thorny problem, it is a tangled mass stuck to an unhealed wound. Here you can see the fate of German teenagers, who grew up amidst air raid sirens and ruins, amidst torn "Greater German" maps and ration cards for meager bread, amidst foreign soldiers and local bandits, amidst talk of canned food and atomic bombs. Here you can also see the fates of Germans of different ages and social standing, who tasted the shameful leftovers that the Third Reich gave them, and who, after realizing the irreparability of the collapse, have stood up and begun to work honestly, use their minds, and fight for fraternal friendship and humanity. The tangled mass I speak of also includes the fate of other nations who have experienced Nazi invasion - the fate of the French, the Czechs, etc., the fate of millions of men and women in the Soviet Union, the fate of people who have built or are building new homes on ruins, the fate of widows, orphans, and mothers who have already cried their eyes out, the fate of people who have learned what the death camps and torture chambers of the German secret police are, and the fate of their comrades and their relatives, the fate of those soldiers who did not forget at the time and will not forget their life experiences. On the tangled mass of the unhealed wound are the fates of many men and women of different nationalities who, during the war, linked their lives to the heroic resistance against fascism. The war between the Nazi aggressors and the peoples of Europe was neither a duel of warriors, nor a conflict of two dynasties or two trusts. Diplomats, lawyers, and politicians may consider whether restoring Hitler's army is legal or appropriate. But the people have a conscience; this conscience is shouting: "Never allow it!"

　　An American commander-in-chief, who recently visited Germany in search of a batch of human flesh, is rushing to revive Hitler's army in spirit. If it is considered justified to revive it, then it is inevitable that the heroism, self-sacrifice, and sacred indignation of the partisans of Belarus, Poland, and France should be cursed. For them, as for all honest people in Europe, the war against the Nazi aggressors was not only a patriotic duty, but also to uphold the ideals of all mankind. Those who set fire to Korean cities with gasoline bombs, those who slaughter the elderly and infants in that unfortunate country, can naturally re-support those who once destroyed tens of thousands of Soviet villages, those who once ravaged Lidice and Oradour, and those who once participated in the work of the Auschwitz crematoria. But honest people all over the world will never call the murderers of children soldiers. When General Eisenhower arrived in Germany, he said: Now is the time to forget the past. It sounds very noble if people do not think carefully about the meaning of this sentence. But if you think about it carefully, you will know that it is evil. No one has ever blamed the Russians for holding grudges. We do not bear old grudges. Our people have extended their hands to welcome those Germans who have embarked on the path of peaceful and honest life. But we are not forgetful people - we have not forgotten. To leave behind what fascism did in Europe is not only to betray our beloved dead, but also to betray our children. Memory is a noble gift, it is the dividing line between humans and worms. To leave behind the crimes committed by Hitler's army is not only to betray the French and Poles, but also to betray Europe and even the world. I do not think that forgetting can help the German people, on the contrary, forgetting is also dangerous and tragic for the German people. For Germany, restoring Hitler's army means repeating the terrible path from January 1933 to May 1945. Leaving the past behind means coming again, first with a military demonstration, and then entering a military grave; it means occupying other people's towns, and then witnessing the destruction of their own cities. What the German people hope to restore is not the generals of the "Wehrmacht", but their own good reputation; what they hope to restore is not the SS, but the honest and peaceful workers of Germany; what they hope to restore is not the divisions of the Stormtroopers, but their cities, schools, libraries, and museums.

　　American newspapers want to convince mindless people that the restored German army will not be like Hitler's army. But who will put this new army together? It is the group of people who led Hitler's soldiers to commit crimes one after another. General Hans Speidel is the closest advisor to the Americans. He commanded the Italian Eighth Army in Stalingrad, and he leveled hundreds of villages in Ukraine. Working with him is another Hitlerite, General Heusinger, who also participated in the attack on the Soviet Union. Where was the plan to restore the German army, which was approved by the Americans, drawn up? It was drafted in Landsberg Prison. Until recently, war criminals convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal were held there. With the approval of the Americans, General Hans Speidel called his brother, Wilhelm Speidel, who was convicted of brutally massacring Greeks, to draft the plan to restore the German Wehrmacht. So their army was born in prison. The main promoters of this plan are convicted people, former murderers of children and murderers of people.

　　The army they are restoring is conceived in the underground fascist groups of SS officers. There, there is General Manteuffel, the former commander of "Greater Germany", there are SS men Peake-Blenchshit, Frank Gricksch, Major General Rommel, and Doles and Kidler of the German Imperial Socialist Party, as well as the so-called "New Führer" Loritz. The atmosphere there is the atmosphere of the Munich tavern, the place where the person who turned thousands of towns into scorched earth, the person cursed by all the mothers in the world, began his activities.

　　The underground fascist groups have already reappeared. It is speaking to American recruiters with an arrogance of self-praise.

　　General Eberbach demanded the immediate restoration of Nazi honor, saying: "We are not soldiers of evil, we have also fought against the Communists." Because of this sentence, McCloy issued an order to pardon war criminals. Perhaps tomorrow we will see the convicted Nazi SS wearing American medals on their chests. This will not surprise anyone. How can MacArthur condemn Hitler's arsonists? How can the Ku Klux Klan, who lynch black people, blame the Nazi SS who killed millions of Jews? How can Mr. Truman, who advocates organizing an anti-communist crusade, not take off his hat to his predecessors in steel helmets?

　　Krupp, who helped Hitler become Hitler and made money from every bullet and every corpse, and who was sentenced to twelve years in prison and confiscation of property three years ago, has now been released. All of his property has been returned to him. Yesterday he was a war criminal, and today he is the first arms manufacturer. The warmongers are now unscrupulous, and they are neither ashamed of Franco's embrace, nor of the outstretched hand of the Nazi SS, nor of Krupp's guns.

　　How can General Eisenhower, who once condemned Nazi crimes in his own book, now be so intimately with them? This American is not a restrained person, theory is theory, and practice is practice. The Americans, who are planning another war, have prepared everything - mobilization plans, general staff, atomic bombs, canned food, special reporters, etc.; they only lack one thing - soldiers. They have dragged the Turks and Greeks, the Dutch and French, the Colombians and British to Korea. Now they are looking for soldiers to fight Russia. They have not forgotten the situation at the end of 1944, when the German divisions, although weakened by the fighting on the Eastern Front, still inflicted a blow on Eisenhower's army in the Ardennes. They want to buy first-class cannon fodder in Germany, and I say this with certainty, not based on mere speculation, but based on the open remarks of talkative Americans. Not long ago, Senator Johnson suggested recruiting a foreign legion of one million soldiers, mainly Germans. He bluntly said that this could save the lives of one million American youth, and his colleague Senator Lodge argued that it should not be one million, but two million.

　　They are taking in immigrants from Silesia, Pomerania, and the Sudetenland in warehouses and barracks, telling them: "You will soon be able to recover your lost territory."

　　What do the people involved think about this? I am not talking about the Germans who are now building a new life and fighting for peace and human harmony with all honest people. I am now talking about the Germans who have been poisoned by the Nazis and who still believed in Hitler until the last moment, and who broke up with Hitler not because he launched a criminal war, but because he failed in this war. Are these people willing to listen to the American recruiters? I don't think so: their calculations are as shameless as their American partners. They are indifferent to the promises made by the Americans, not because the Americans are preparing an abhorrent war of conquest, but because they doubt whether the Americans can win such a war. They remember that the Americans have always been accustomed to driving others to fight, while they sit back and divide the spoils. Hitler's soldiers who have been to Russia know that the war that some Americans are planning will be extremely fierce, and they would rather fight "in the American way." Silesians or Pomeranians, even those who have been poisoned by fascism, generously replied to the Americans: "Since you are the most powerful country, it is best for you to take the lead. As for us, we will come later to recover our land."...

　　Needless to say, the revival of the Nazi army has aroused great anger among the German working people who have already recognized the despicable nature of fascism. In the German Democratic Republic, the angry voices of the German people are loudly echoing, and in West Germany, despite all the prohibitions, clamor, and persecution, this voice can also be heard. If the occupiers promised to hold a plebiscite - asking whether to restore the German Wehrmacht - I am convinced that nine out of ten Germans would answer "no."

　　The restoration of the German army in any form, and the activities of restoring the German war industry currently being carried out in West Germany, have angered peace-loving people all over the world. Needless to say, the American newspapers believe that only the Communists oppose the rearmament of Germany. This is a recent lie. Marin, one of the oldest members of the French Parliament, is not a Communist, nor a Socialist, he is right-leaning. Members of the British Parliament, Fletcher and Millich, are not Communists, they are members of the ruling party. The writer Thomas Mann is not a Communist. The famous Swiss theologian Barth is not a Communist. British Minister Dalton is not a Communist. The former Minister of the Interior of the Bonn government, Heinemann, is not a Communist. Pastor Niemöller is not a Communist. All these people with different ideas have expressed their opposition to arming Germany. They understand: The revival of the German Wehrmacht may soon lead to a tragic end. Our noble institution - the World Peace Council, the only international institution with genuine representatives of the people of all countries, must unite against the movement for German re-militarization, because this movement opposes a measure that would lead to war in Europe and is therefore not only illegal but also criminal.

　　In the terrible gamble of those who long for war, Germany must be neither a player nor a manipulated card. We must not allow the restoration of the German army and war industry. The German people must be given the opportunity to restore Germany, to work peacefully, and to contribute their strength to the world cultural treasury to which they have contributed in the past. It is not our business to unite people with all kinds of different opinions, to compare the internal systems of the two parts of Germany, their social structures, their laws and ideas. In one of these two halves of Germany, young people see the road to harmonious coexistence and international unity, while in the other half, revenge, hatred, and war are being promoted. But we should say and have a responsibility to say: As long as Germany is divided into two parts, the tinder of Europe will accumulate, and a single American cigarette butt will be enough to spark a raging fire. The World Peace Council must demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with a peacefully unified Germany. This will be a step towards peace, while building a German army, strengthening the occupying forces in Germany, and delaying this unnatural division will inevitably lead to disaster.

　　Those who are planning a new war are paying particular attention to Europe. It is here, on our ancient and glorious continent, that the massacre they crave will take place. American Senator Fulbright said: We will help Europeans by destroying European cities. Only cannibals can say such words, people who cannot understand how many centuries of labor and energy it takes to build Paris, Rome, and London. To all those who cherish the ancient culture of Europe, all those who do not regard the Uffizi Gallery and the Louvre, Kyiv, Sofia and Chartres, Prague University and Oxford University, Krakow and Cologne as targets for bombing, but as the living flesh and blood of their beloved homeland of the human spirit, I appeal: do not allow this misfortune to happen!

　　Our people want peace. Not long ago I went to some areas of the Volga, where hydropower stations are being built, and small trees are being planted to change the climate. That old man who planted a one-year-old oak tree, that mother who nurtured her first child who had just turned one year old, I think they are witnesses to our country's great love for peace. We know that the Soviet government, loyal to the wishes of the people, has proposed to the major powers to conclude a peace treaty. Can the mad gamble launched by that group of greedy and irresponsible guys darken the tomorrow of mankind? Can we, who have been sent here by the people who are anxious day and night, allow this unprecedented misfortune to happen? No, we must stop the war, we are saying this at a moment full of tragedy and at the same time full of hope.

### 爱伦堡在世界和平理事会会议上的发言

　　爱伦堡在世界和平理事会会议上的发言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十四日电：爱伦堡在世界和平理事会二十二日下午的会议上的发言全文如下：
    我们曾怀着满意的心情离开了华沙，我们看到，我们的力量已经增长，人民将不会茫然不觉地为一小撮恶魔或疯子所摆布，崇高的保卫生命的机构，——世界和平理事会——已经成立了。三个月已经过去。我们为和平运动的增长而欣慰，这种欣慰并没有错。正直的美国人的呼声在越来越增加，也愈来愈坚强；他们警告他们的同胞，注意他们的统治者正在进行的危险赌博。但是，争取和平的运动愈壮大，可憎的赌博也就愈疯狂。理性和良心的觉醒使战争煽动者大为恐慌，他们更加忙乱起来了。朝鲜的情形就是他们的预演。失败并没有使他们清醒。那些在光天化日之下恬不知耻地要求轰炸中国，要求使用原子弹，还要求发动第三次世界大战的人，并不是疯人院里的疯子，而是一个大国代议机构里的议员。他们不仅准备把自己的青年而且也准备把欧洲的精华驱上屠场。他们在世界市场上购买人的血肉，正像他们的祖先从前购买羊毛或矿苗一样。
    由于苏联人民的毅力、欧洲游击队的英勇、英国和美国普通人民的巨大努力才得以成立的国际机构，这个在五年前全世界人民都寄以期望的机构，现在已被他们变成了穷乡僻壤的戏台，观众都是些从密西西比或俄克拉荷马来的头脑简单的人。我们看到，一些人怀着邪恶的阴谋远渡重洋，并使一个辽远的异国土地渗透了孩子们的鲜血，但他们却在高叫：“救命呀！人家在攻打我们了！”人们或许会以为，美国学校里的孩子们游历到了朝鲜，而受到了心肠阴险的主人恶待。人们或许会以为，中国人攻占了旧金山，并在得克萨斯州投下了炸弹。人们或许会以为，鸭绿江是流贯在密执安州，手无寸铁的美国女孩正在这河岸上休息，而被凶残的中国人袭击。这并不是什么开玩笑，这是可憎恶的。战争煽动者力图用蓝色的布片来遮掩那染满了鲜血的匕首。
    他们在准备着空前未有的杀戮，什么也不放在眼下：他们在德国的桥梁上埋下地雷，招募哥伦比亚的可怜的恶魔，他们在内华达州试验原子弹，在布鲁塞尔试验他们欧洲家臣的忠诚，他们披起羊皮，而吓破了胆的智利或荷兰就赶紧写上它们的签字，让屠杀人民的家伙胡作非为。
    法西斯的德意志帝国党的主席最近在不伦瑞克说：“德国人民的首要责任就是恢复党卫军的荣誉。麦克阿瑟将军的队伍把整个整个的乡村连着妇女小孩一起毁掉，因此现在再也没有人能有权利斥责我们了。”是的，美国战争煽动者已复活了希特勒的业绩。看到了这一点，对于他们力图复活希特勒军队，谁还会感到惊异呢！
    我们正聚集在它的首都开会的这个国家的命运不只是德国人的忧虑的根源，全世界人民的目光都集中在德国。这可以用地理环境来解释：在我们面前是一个位于欧洲正中心、被武断地分割成两部分的国家。在它的疆界之外是两个世界，这两个世界的和平共存，战争挑拨者是不承认的，而这个国家的一半已变成军事行动的桥头堡了。人们也可以用历史来解释全世界人民关心德国前途的原因：德国曾屡次干涉其他国家人民的命运，它的士兵曾一再越过外国的疆界。人们常常问道：“德国人将来会做些甚么？”或者问道：“对德国人怎么办？”不管甚么地方的人民都认识到，如果德国被拉进军事联盟的话，战争的危险就会增加。人民同时也认识到，如果德国不参加这种联盟的话，那么战争挑拨者在没有从威胁进而开致命的第一枪以前，他们就会好生考虑。
    有人也许会问我，为什么我笼统地说德国。是呀，有两个德国彼此各不相同。当然，我知道领导德意志民主共和国的人是不同于宣布波恩城为第二德国的首都的人的。我知道，在柏林议会正在通过保卫和平法案的时候，波恩政府部长正在进行使西德参加军事联盟的谈判。但是如果在我说到德国的命运时好像忽略暂时的边界的话，那只是因为我不能把国家的命运和人民的命运分开。
    美因河上的法兰克福的居民和奥得河上的法兰克福的居民曾经历过同样的盛衰的时代，创造过同样珍贵的东西，犯过同样的错误，度过共同的生活。这些人民不是昨天才诞生的，他们也不是昨天才知道他们是统一的。德国好像每一个仍存在着社会矛盾的国家一样，有着内部分界线；这一界线不是沿易比河，也不是沿其他某一个河流，它存在于每一个城市，它分隔着克虏伯先生的别墅和他的工人的住家。但是，不是也有两个法国——一个签订军事公约，而另一个要求和平么？………恕我所说的不是美因河上的法兰克福的命运，也不是奥得河上的法兰克福的命运，而是德国的命运。
    我们曾听过外交家们的争论，法律家们关于国际法问题的争吵以及政治家们的辩论。我不是外交家，也不是法律家，也不是政治家。我愿意作为一个曾经历过和我同时代的人所经历的一切的人来看待德国问题。我要抛开客套而直截了当地说话——客套常常是比真话来得无礼的。德国前途问题是一个错综复杂的伤脑筋的问题，它是粘在没有治好的创伤上的一团乱毛。在这里，你可以看到德国少年的命运，这些少年是在空袭警报和废墟中长大的，在撕破了的“大日耳曼”地图和配购少许面包的配给证中长大的，是在外国士兵和本地强盗当中长大的，是在关于罐头食品和原子弹的谈论中长大的。在这里，你也可以看到各种年龄不同、社会地位不同的德国人的命运，他们曾尝过第三帝国送给他们的可耻的残羹，他们在认识到垮台的不可救药的程度以后，已经站立起来，开始诚实地工作，动脑筋，并为争取兄弟的友爱和人道而奋斗了。我所说的那一团乱毛也还包括曾经历过纳粹入侵的其他民族的命运——法国人、捷克人等民族的命运，苏联千百万男女的命运，已经或正在废墟上建立起新的家园的人民的命运，已经连眼睛都哭了出来的寡妇、孤儿、母亲们的命运，已经懂得什么是德国秘密警察的死亡营和刑讯室的人民以及他们的同志和他们的亲戚的命运，那些当时没有忘记而且将来也不会忘记他们生活经历的士兵们的命运。在没有治好的创伤上的一团乱毛上的是曾经在战时把自己的生活与对法西斯主义的英雄抵抗联结在一起的不同民族的许多男女们的命运。纳粹侵略者与欧洲各国人民间的战争既不是武士们的决斗，也不是两个朝代或两个托辣斯的冲突。外交家、法律家和政治家可能考虑恢复希特勒军队是否合法或是否适宜。但是人民是有良心的；这个良心在呼喊：“绝不许恢复！”
    为了找寻一批人肉而最近访问过德国的一个美国总司令急忙要使希特勒军队在精神上复活。如果认为这种复活是正当的话，那末势必就该诅咒白俄罗斯、波兰和法国的游击队员们的英雄主义、自我牺牲和神圣的义愤了。对他们说来，正如对欧洲一切正直的人们一样，反对纳粹侵略者的战争不仅是爱国的义务，并且也是为了维护全人类的理想。用汽油弹放火焚烧朝鲜城市的人、在那个不幸的国家里杀戮老人和婴孩的人，自然可以重新扶植那些曾经毁灭成千成万的苏联村庄、那些曾经蹂躏过利台斯和奥拉多尔以及那些曾经参加过奥斯维齐姆烧人场工作的人们。但是全世界正直的人民决不会把屠杀儿童的人叫做兵士的。艾森豪威尔将军到达德国的时候曾经说：现在是忘记过去的时候了。如果人们不把这句话的意义细细思索一番，它听来像很高尚似的。但是如果把它细细想一想，就知道它是罪恶的。谁也不曾责备说俄国人怀恨旧仇。我们是不念旧恶的。我国人民已经伸出双手对那些走上了和平诚实生活的道路的德国人表示欢迎。但是我们并不是健忘的人——我们并没有忘记。把法西斯在欧洲的所作所为抛在脑后，不仅是出卖我们所敬爱的死者，也是出卖我们的孩子。记忆是一种高贵的天赋，它是人类与虫豸的分界线。把希特勒军所犯的罪行抛在脑后，不仅是出卖法国人和波兰人，也是出卖欧洲以至全世界。我不以为忘怀能够帮助德国人民，正相反，忘怀对于德国人民也是危险的，悲惨的。恢复希特勒军队，对于德国来说，就是重蹈一九三三年一月至一九四五年五月的可怖的覆辙。把过去抛在脑后，就是再来一遍，首先是作军事示威，然后就走入军事坟墓；就是去强占别国的城镇，以后再目睹自己的城市毁灭。德国人民所希望恢复的不是“国防军”将领，而是他们自己的好名声；他们所希望恢复的不是党卫军，而是德国正直而和平的劳动者；他们所希望恢复的不是冲锋队的师团，而是他们的城市，学校，图书馆和博物馆。
    美国报纸想要使没有脑筋的人相信恢复起来的德国军队不会像希特勒军队。但是谁来把这支新的军队拚凑起来呢？是那批曾经率领着希特勒的士兵接二连三地犯罪的人。汉斯·斯派达尔将军是美国人的最亲信的顾问。他曾在斯大林格勒指挥意大利的第八军，他曾把乌克兰的几百个村庄夷为平地。与他一同工作的还有一个希特勒分子豪辛格将军，他也曾参加对苏联的进攻。美国人所核准的恢复德国军队的计划是在什么地方拟定的呢？是在兰斯堡监狱里拟订的。直到最近为止，被纽伦堡法庭判了罪的战犯都是关在那里的。汉斯·斯派达尔将军经美国人同意后，就叫他的因残酷屠杀希腊人而被判罪的兄弟威廉·斯派达尔草拟恢复德国国防军的计划。所以他们的军队是在牢狱里产生的。这个计划的主要推动者是被定罪了的人，是从前屠杀儿童和屠杀人民的凶手。
    他们正在恢复的军队是在党卫军军官的地下法西斯集团中孕育的。在那里，有前“大德意志”司令官曼陀菲尔将军，有党卫军军人培克——布连吓西特、夫朗克格里克什，有罗米尔少将以及德意志帝国社会党的多尔斯和基德勒，还有所谓“新元首”洛里茨。那里的气氛是慕尼黑酒店的气氛，这慕尼黑酒店就是那个把千百座城镇化为焦土的人、那个被世界上所有的母亲们诅咒的人开始他的活动的地方。
    地下法西斯集团已经又出头露面了。它以骄矜自夸的气概在与美国的招兵人员说话了。
    艾柏巴赫将军要求立即恢复纳粹的荣誉，他说：“我们并不是恶魔的兵士，我们也和共产党打过仗。”因为这句话，麦克洛埃就签发了赦免战争罪犯的命令。也许明天我们就会看见曾被定罪的纳粹党卫军胸间戴上美国的勋章。这将不会使任何人惊讶。麦克阿瑟怎么能斥责希特勒的纵火凶徒呢？对黑人施以私刑的三Ｋ党徒怎么能责备杀害数百万犹太人的纳粹党卫军呢？主张组织反共十字军的杜鲁门先生，怎么能不在他的老前辈们的钢盔之前脱帽致敬呢？
    曾经帮助希特勒成为希特勒，从每一颗子弹、每一具尸体上赚钱的、三年前被判处十二年徒刑并没收财产的克虏伯，现在已被释放了。他的全部财产都已归还他。昨天他还是战争罪犯，而今天他却是第一个军火制造人了。战争的煽动者现在已经毫无忌惮了，他们既不以佛朗哥的拥抱、不以纳粹党卫军所伸出来的手为羞，也不以克虏伯的枪炮为耻。
    曾在自己所著的书中斥责纳粹罪行的艾森豪威尔将军，怎么在目前又会同他们亲慝地在一起呢？这一个美国人不是拘谨的人，理论是理论，实际是实际。正在策划另一次战争的美国人，已经准备好了一切——动员计划、参谋总部、原子弹、罐头食品、特派记者等；他们只缺一样东西——兵士。他们已把土耳其人和希腊人、荷兰人和法国人、哥伦比亚人和英国人拖到朝鲜去。现在他们又在寻找兵士来和俄国作战。他们没有忘记一九四四年年底的情形，那时德军各师虽已因东线作战而削弱了，但却仍使艾森豪威尔的军队在阿登地区遭受了打击。他们想在德国买头等的炮灰，我肯定地这样说，并不是根据凭空的臆测，而是根据健谈的美国人的公开言论。不多久以前，参议员约翰逊曾建议征募一支一百万兵员的外籍兵团，主要是德国人。他直言不讳地说这可以保全一百万美国青年的生命，他的同僚参议员洛奇辩驳说：要募的不是一百万，而是两百万。
    他们把由西里西亚、波美拉尼亚和苏台德省出去的移民收留在仓库和营房里，向他们说：“你们不久就可以收复失地了。”
    与这有关的人民对这种事怎么看法呢？我所说的不是现在正在建设新生活并与所有正直的人民一道为和平与人类的和睦相处而斗争的德国人。我现在所说的德国人是中了纳粹的毒，直到最后一刻还在信仰希特勒，他们所以和希特勒分了手并不是因为他发动了罪恶的战争，而是因为他在这场战争中失败了的那些德国人。这些人是不是情愿听从美国招兵人员的说话呢？我想不会：他们的盘算是和他们的美国同伙一样无耻的。他们对美国所答应的诺言很冷淡，并不是因为美国人在准备令人憎恶的征服战争，而是他们怀疑美国人是不是能够赢得这样一场战争。他们记得美国人向来是惯于驱使别人打仗，而自己坐地分赃的。到过俄国的希特勒士兵知道，某些美国人正在策划的那个战争会是异常激烈的，他们倒愿意“按美国的方式”去打。西里西亚人或者波美拉尼亚人，甚至是那些中了法西斯毒素的人，都慷慨大方地回答美国人说：“你们既然是一个最强大的国家，最好是你们去打头阵。至于我们呢，我们将随后来收复我们的土地。”……
    纳粹军队的复活使那些已经认识法西斯主义的卑鄙本质的德国劳苦人民大为忿怒，难道那还须多说吗？在德意志民主共和国中，德国人民愤怒的呼声嘹亮地回响着，而在西德，尽管有一切禁令、叫嚣和迫害，也可以听到这种呼声。假如占领者答应举行一次民意测验——问要不要恢复德国国防军——，我深信德国人十个里头有九个会回答说“不要”。
    以任何形式恢复德国军队、目前正在西德实行的恢复德国战争工业的活动，已激怒了全世界各国爱好和平的人民。不用说，美国的报纸认为只有共产党人反对德国的重新武装。这是最近捏造的一种谎言。法国一位最老的议员马林并不是一个共产党人，也不是一个社会党人，他是右倾的人。英国议会的议员弗莱彻和米立希都不是共产党人，他们是执政党的党员。作家托玛斯·曼并不是一个共产党人。瑞士著名神学家巴特并不是共产党人。英国大臣达尔顿并不是共产党人。波恩政府的前内长海尼曼并不是共产党人。牧师尼穆勒并不是共产党人。所有这些想法不同的人们，都表示反对武装德国。他们懂得：德国国防军的复活可能很快就招致悲惨的结局。我们的崇高的机构——世界和平理事会，唯一拥有各国人民的真正代表人物的国际机构，必须团结反对德国重新军国主义化的运动，因为这个运动反对一种会在欧洲招致战争因而不仅不合法而且是罪恶的措施。
    在那些渴望战争的人们的可怖赌博中，德国必须既不是玩牌的人，也不是被玩弄的牌。我们决不能容许恢复德国军队和战争工业。必须使德国人民有机会去恢复德国，去和平地劳作，去给他们从前曾经有过贡献的世界文化宝库贡献他们的力量。我们团结具有各种不同见解的人们，把德国两部分的内部制度，它们的社会结构，它们的法律和思想加以比较，并不是我们的事情。在这两半个德国中的一个里，青年人看到了通往和睦相处与国际团结的道路，而在另一半，却在宣扬复仇、憎恨和战争。但是我们应该说而且有责任要说：只要德国一天还被分割为两部分，欧洲的火种就会累积起来，只消一个美国烟屁股就能够爆发熊熊的火焰。世界和平理事会必须要求与和平统一的德国缔结和约。这将是迈向和平的一个步骤，而建立德国军队，加强在德国的占领军，拖延这种不自然的分裂状态就不可避免地会引向灾难。
    那些正在策划新战争的人们特别频繁地在注视欧洲。就是在这里，在我们这个古老而光荣的大陆上，将要发生他们所渴求的大屠杀。美国参议员福尔布莱特说：我们将以毁灭欧洲的城市来帮助欧洲人。这种话只有吃人生番才说得出口，这种人无法了解建设巴黎、罗马和伦敦需要多少世纪的劳动和精力。向所有珍视欧洲古代文化的人们，所有不把尤费齐博物院和卢佛宫、基辅、索非亚和夏尔特，布拉格大学和牛津大学，克拉科和科隆看作存心轰炸的目标，而是看作他们所珍爱的人类精神故乡的活生生的血与肉的人们，我呼吁：不要容许这种不幸发生！
    我国人民希望和平。不久前我曾去到伏尔加一些地区，在那里，水电站正在兴建，为了改变气候正在栽植小树。种了一棵一年的橡树的那位老人，那个抚育着她刚满一岁的第一个孩子的母亲，我想，他们就是我国对和平的伟大的爱的见证人。我们知道，忠于人民的愿望的苏联政府向各大国提出了缔结和平公约的建议。那群贪婪不负责任的家伙所发动的疯狂赌博能够使人类的明天黑暗吗？我们这些被日夜在焦虑的人民派到这里来的人难道能容许这种空前的不幸发生吗？不能，我们一定要制止战争，我们是在一个充满着悲剧同时又充满着希望的时刻说这句话的。
