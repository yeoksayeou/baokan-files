　　Several Problems in the Current Purchase-on-Credit Work
　　Wang Yueyi
Since the cooperative societies in Shandong, Chahar, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi and other provinces started purchase-on-credit work in some areas at the end of last year, they have achieved initial results in Shandong, Chahar, and other provinces, and gained some experience in key pilot projects, which are welcomed by cooperative members. According to incomplete statistics, Shandong has purchased over 10 million jin of peanuts and 270,000 jin of cotton on credit, and Shanxi has purchased over 61,000 jin of cotton and hemp on credit. The purchase-on-credit and storage work in Chahar has begun to be promoted. The National Federation of Cooperatives convened a reporting meeting of business cadres from the above-mentioned regions in Beijing on January 31. Based on the experience of key pilot projects in various regions, purchase-on-credit indeed solves a big problem for farmers in selling their products, but farmers still have great concerns about purchase-on-credit, such as some members worrying: "A good account is not as good as bad cash, it's easy to buy on credit but difficult to get the money back," thinking that it is more convenient to keep it themselves than to sell it to the cooperative, and some members think it is a disguised form of expanding shares.

Therefore, in areas where the credit foundation of cooperative societies is relatively poor, when carrying out this work, the significance of purchase-on-credit should first be explained clearly to the Party and government cadres in the villages, and in-depth publicity and explanation should be carried out through the village cadres, specifically explaining the benefits of purchase-on-credit to the members, and that the cooperative society will definitely guarantee repayment, and even propose using public grain as collateral. It should also be emphasized that the cooperative is equal to the members' warehouse, easy to access, and specific methods can be proposed according to the situation.

Secondly, the cooperative should guarantee capital preservation and value maintenance, calculate interest on a monthly basis, allow lump-sum deposit and partial withdrawal, listen to price increases but not price drops, and guarantee timely supply of goods at reasonable prices when repaying, in order to protect the interests of the members. For example, in Yaobao Village, Wanquan County, Chahar Province, the village's Party and government cadres first mobilized, followed by the cooperative purchasing corn and sorghum from members on credit. When repaying with oat flour, it was 30 yuan per jin lower than the market price (750 yuan for private merchants, 720 yuan for the cooperative), which dispelled the members' concerns and won their support. The members said: "This method is very good, the cooperative is doing good things for us, and will not let us suffer losses, so there is no need to use public grain as collateral." After the members experienced actual benefits and their thinking was straightened out, Yan Faying's family deposited ten shi of sorghum and five shi of corn, and Yan Guoxiang deposited four shi of sorghum, and Zhao Zongrong deposited three shi of corn. In five days, 1,074 members deposited 142 shi and four sheng of miscellaneous grains on credit. Another example is the Guozhuang Township Cooperative in Wuqiao County, Shandong, where from January 10th to 13th, members purchased 26,020 jin of cotton on credit in order to exchange for the millet, corn, bean cake, etc. they needed.

However, according to reports from Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Chahar, and Suiyuan, the purchase-on-credit work has not yet been fully launched. The following problems still exist in the minds of leading cadres:

First of all, cooperative societies in various provinces have not paid enough attention to the purchase-on-credit business, and have only roughly deployed it. In the process of carrying out the purchase-on-credit work, they have failed to develop according to the actual situation and solve difficult problems in a timely manner. For example, some cadres believe that purchase-on-credit is to solve the problem of insufficient funds for state-owned trading companies to purchase, and since state-owned companies have already carried out large-scale purchases of certain agricultural products, purchase-on-credit is no longer needed; some believe that the market price of some major agricultural products is close to equilibrium, or the market price is higher than the listed price, and the difficulty for members to sell is no longer present. These understandings mistakenly regard purchase-on-credit as a temporary task for state-owned trading companies, not a regular and inherent task for cooperative societies, so they cannot carry out extensive and in-depth publicity work among the members, resulting in the purchase-on-credit work not being able to be widely carried out.

Secondly, in some areas, the combination of cooperative societies and state-owned trading companies is not close enough. For example, some cannot get the guarantee from state-owned trading companies for the goods needed to repay members, or cannot combine the supply business with the purchase-on-credit business, resulting in the purchase-on-credit failing to proceed.

After the research of the reporting meeting, the following issues were clarified:

I. Rural cooperative members generally do not like to sell their surplus products for money, but prefer to exchange them for the things they need, not only to exchange for living materials, but also mostly to exchange for spring production materials. As long as the cooperative society can timely supply members with production materials and living materials of high quality and low price, purchase-on-credit is entirely possible. For example, in Handan Prefecture, the market price of cotton is 200 yuan higher than the listed price at the time of purchase-on-credit, but the cooperative society supplies members with bean cake at only 550 yuan, while the market price of bean cake is 650 yuan. Although 200 yuan less is given to the masses for the purchase-on-credit of cotton, each jin of cotton exchanged for bean cake gives the members more than 1,000 yuan of real benefit. If the accounts are carefully calculated in this way, the members will be willing to sell their cotton to the cooperative society at the listed price, rather than selling it for a higher price for money.

II. Purchase-on-credit work is a long-term credit work of the cooperative society for its members. It is one of the best methods to promote the sale of members' products and supply members with production materials and living materials in the case of insufficient operating funds of the state and the cooperative society. It is wrong to ignore this purpose and emphasize the interests of any one party.

III. Purchase-on-credit after the Spring Festival is more difficult than in autumn and winter. However, the conditions for purchase-on-credit still exist. Farmers need a large supply of production materials, and at the same time, due to the busy farming season, the number of things that farmers need the cooperative society to handle on their behalf in production has increased. Therefore, the purchase-on-credit work still has wide conditions for development. The key lies in whether the cooperative society can grasp and guarantee the supply of production materials for the spring plowing of farmers.

IV. Purchase-on-credit is a difficult and complex mass work, and must be closely integrated with the Party, government, and people's organizations. The basic reason for the difficulties currently encountered in purchase-on-credit is that the cooperative society has not yet established a high degree of credit among the masses. Therefore, at the beginning of the purchase-on-credit work, we should adhere to the principle of "rather less, but better", carefully summarize experience, promote experience, and lay a good foundation for rural credit work.

This report clarified the above understanding and improved confidence. On the basis of past progress, the purchase-on-credit business will be further developed.

### 目前赊购工作中的几个问题

　　目前赊购工作中的几个问题
　　王越毅
    山东、察哈尔、河北、平原、山西等省合作社自去年底在若干地区开展赊购工作以来，在山东、察哈尔等省已获初步成绩，并在重点试办中取得些经验，受到社员欢迎。据不完全统计，山东已赊入花生米一千余万斤，棉花二十七万斤，山西赊入棉麻六万一千余斤，察哈尔赊购存实工作已开始推广。全国合作社联合总社于一月三十一日在京召集上述地区业务干部举行赊购工作汇报，根据各地区重点试办的经验，赊购固然为农民推销产品解决很大问题，但是农民对赊购还存有很大的顾虑，如有的社员顾虑：“好账不如赖现钱，赊账容易要账难”，认为赊给合作社，不如自己存着方便，有的社员认为是变相扩股。
    因此，在合作社信用基础较差的地区，在进行这一工作时，首先要把赊购意义向村的党政干部解释清楚，通过村干部进行深入的宣传解释，具体地说明赊购对社员的利益，以及合作社一定保证偿还，以至提出可以公粮作抵押。并要着重说明合作社等于社员的仓库，取用方便，且可根据情况，提出具体办法。
    其次，合作社应保本保值，按月计息，整存零取，听涨不听落，偿还时保证及时供给物品，物美价廉，以保障社员的利益。如察省万全县腰堡村，首先由村的党政干部动员，继之是合作社赊入社员玉米，红粮，偿还莜面时，以每斤低于市价三十元（私商七五○，社价七二○元），解除了社员顾虑，取得了社员拥护。社员们说：“这个办法可不错，合作社是为咱们办好事的，不让咱们吃亏，不要公粮作抵押。”社员经过实际利益的体验，思想搞通了，该村阎发英一户即存入高粱十石，玉米五石，阎国祥存高粱四石，赵宗荣存玉米三石，在五天中，即有一千零七十四名社员，赊存杂粮一百四十二石四升。又如山东吴桥县郭庄乡社，由一月十日开始到十三日，社员赊入棉花二万六千零二十斤，以便换回他们需要的谷子、玉米、豆饼等。
    但从山西、河北、平原、山东、察哈尔、绥远各地汇报看来，赊购工作尚未全面展开，在领导干部的思想上，还存着以下问题：
    首先是各省合作社对赊购业务未予以十分重视，仅粗略地布置下去，在赊购工作进行中，未能根据实际情况发展，及时解决困难问题。如有的干部认为赊购是为解决国营贸易公司收购资金的不足，国营公司既已对某些农产品进行大量收购，赊购即不需要了；有的认为，有些主要农产品，牌市价已接近平衡，或者市价高于牌价，社员的推销困难已不存在。这些认识是把赊购误认为是为了国营贸易公司的临时性的工作，不是合作社的经常性的本职工作，因此就不能在社员群众中，进行广泛深入的宣传工作，致使赊购工作不能广泛地开展起来。
    其次，有的地区，合作社和国营贸易公司结合不够密切，如有的得不到国营贸易公司对偿还社员需要物品的保证，或者不能把供给业务和赊购业务结合起来，致使赊购未能进行。
    经过汇报会议的研究，明确了以下的问题：
    一、农村社员要推销的多余产品，一般不喜欢卖钱，喜欢换回自己需要的东西，不仅是为了换回生活资料，且大部分是为了换回春季的生产资料，只要合作社能够及时供给社员以物美价廉的生产资料和生活资料，赊购是完全可能的。如邯郸专区棉花市价高于赊购时的牌价二百元，但合作社供给社员豆饼仅五百五十元，而市场上豆饼则为六百五十元，虽在赊购棉花上少给群众二百元，但每斤棉花换的豆饼，则给社员群众千余元实惠，如果这样细算账，社员的棉花就会愿意按牌价赊给合作社，不愿意高价地卖钱了。
    二、赊购工作是合作社对社员的长期的信用工作，是在国家和合作社经营资金不足情况下，为了推销社员产品，供给社员生产资料和生活资料的最好方法之一，如果忽略了这个目的，强调任何一方面的利益都是不对的。
    三、春节后的赊购，较之秋冬是困难了。但赊购条件仍然存在，农民需要大批生产资料的供给，同时由于农忙，农民在生产上需要合作社代办的事情增多了，因此赊购工作仍然有广泛开展的条件。关键在于合作社能不能抓住和保证供给农民春耕的生产资料。
    四、赊购是艰巨复杂的群众工作，必须和党、政、民各部门密切结合。目前赊购所遭遇的困难，基本原因是合作社在群众中尚未树立起高度的信用。因此，在赊购工作的开始，应本着“宁肯少些，但要好些”的原则，认真地总结经验，推广经验，给农村信用工作打下良好的基础。
    这次汇报明确了以上认识，提高了信心，在过去进行的基础上，赊购业务将会得到进一步的开展。
