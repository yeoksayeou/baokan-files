To the Editor:

    During this year's Spring Festival, agricultural technology promoters from the Funing County Farm in Hebei Province mobilized experienced farmers and primary school teachers to form a propaganda team to promote agricultural production technology in thirteen nearby villages. Approximately 2,500 farmers in total attended the lectures in various villages.

    The propaganda team pre-prepared various clapper talks and speaking outlines, and also brought along wall charts of crop diseases and insect pests, as well as physical objects such as pesticides and sprayers. Upon arriving at each village, they would carry out propaganda in places easily accessible to villagers, sometimes combining it with Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities. The propaganda focused on explaining cotton planting techniques and preventing and controlling common local diseases and insect pests. During the performances, demonstrations were given on seed soaking, seed mixing, and the production of lime-tobacco water and lime-sulfur mixture. After the promoters finished speaking, they distributed mimeographed drafts to literate farmers, asking them to continue the propaganda and promotion. The farmers welcomed this kind of propaganda very much.

　　抚宁县农场组织宣传小组到附近农村宣传农业技术
    编辑同志：
    今年春节期间，河北抚宁县农场的农业技术推广员，动员老农及小学教员等组成了宣传小组，到附近十三个乡村宣传农业生产技术，各村听讲的农民共约二千五百余人。
    宣传组预先编好了各种快板、讲话提纲，并携带了农作物病虫害挂图及农药、喷雾器等实物，每到一村，即在村民易于集中的地方展开宣传，有时就和春节文化娱乐活动结合进行。宣传内容，以讲解种棉技术及防治当地常见的病虫害为主。在演唱时并作了浸种、拌种和制造石灰烟草水、石灰硫磺合剂的示范。推广员讲完以后，又把油印的底稿发给识字的农民，请他们继续宣传推广。农民对这种宣传非常欢迎。
