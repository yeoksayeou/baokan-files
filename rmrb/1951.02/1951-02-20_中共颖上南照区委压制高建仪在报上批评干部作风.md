　　The CPC Ying Shang Nan Zhao District Committee Suppresses Gao Jianyi's Criticism of Cadre Work Style in the Newspaper
    Editor's Note: This letter was published in the Anhui Daily on February 10th. This kind of suppression of criticism not only exists in Nan Zhao District, but also in some other places. Therefore, the original letter is reprinted and a short commentary is published, hoping that the party committees at all levels will pay attention to this. All localities should conscientiously implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. Comrade Editor:
    On January 11th, the reader's forum of the Anhui Daily published an article entitled "Zhang Liangfu and Others Secretly Exchange Relief Clothing for the Needy. Please Handle This Matter Quickly Through the Relevant Authorities in Ying Shang County." On the 14th, Zhang Liangfu, a Civil Affairs Officer in Nan Zhao District of the county, cursed loudly after seeing the newspaper, "Who the hell wrote this?" "Who is the 'Red Light' (author) who wrote the article?" He had not calmed down yet, and wanted to go to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy an illustrated magazine to ease his mood. Coincidentally, as Zhang Liangfu walked into the bookstore, he heard someone reading the "Zhang Liangfu and Others Secretly Exchange..." in the newspaper. So he quietly slipped back to the district. But then he encountered a woman who came to file a lawsuit, and said to him intentionally or unintentionally, "Officer Zhang is even in the newspaper!" This was truly "adding fuel to the fire," and Zhang Liangfu was so angry that he cursed for two days in a row. On the 16th, when Zhang Liangfu learned that the author was Gao Jianyi, he went "knocking on his door" in a menacing manner to question him. Gao Jianyi was so frightened that he dared not admit it, so Zhang Liangfu cursed even more vigorously, and made a false show of force, saying, "Red Light is probably a Kuomintang bandit!" This frightened Gao Jianyi so much that he dared not see him again.
    Fu Tongbo, the secretary of the CPC Nan Zhao District Committee, also believed that the author had committed a serious error of lacking organization and discipline. This was looking down on the district committee - can't the district committee solve these "minor matters"? Otherwise, it could be submitted to the county party committee. He should not "secretly" write articles and "report bad things" to the newspaper. The district committee secretary then questioned the propaganda officer, "Where did the paper come from?" "Who did you give it to?" "Did the county party committee propaganda department give you the paper to write these things?" and demanded that the propaganda officer take responsibility. After discovering the author's name, the district committee convened a meeting on the 17th to specifically study this issue. Fu Tongbo's opinion was: "Those who exchanged relief clothing for the needy were certainly wrong, but the author was also wrong." The reason was that Gao Jianyi should not have changed his name to write the article; even more so, he should not have submitted the article on his own without going through the district committee, which led to "lack of unity among cadres" (?), "affected the mood of cadres" (?), and "affected production and disaster relief work" (?). In this situation, the author Gao Jianyi was forced to make a self-criticism, but when he explained that the Anhui Daily correspondent discipline had a provision that "criticism of parties concerned, persons in charge, and leading organs can be made without going through the parties concerned," Fu Tongbo still did not believe it. On the one hand, he flipped through the newspaper to find it, and on the other hand, he wrote a letter to ask the newspaper. He also personally called the county party committee (the district propaganda officer had already asked and replied "yes," but the district committee secretary still did not believe it) until the county party committee said: "This is a decision of the Central Committee of the Party, that is, to enable the people who are in charge to supervise the cadres and manage their own affairs well. This is legal and should be done." And pointed out that their suppression of criticism of the author was wrong. In this way, when the meeting continued on the 18th, District Committee Secretary Fu Tongbo only then made a self-criticism of insufficient leadership inspection. Zhang Liangfu, the Civil Affairs Officer who exchanged relief clothing, Chen Wenjie, the deputy leader of the militia brigade, Liu Guoxing, the public security officer, and others also made self-criticisms one after another. Xu Xinmin, the construction officer who managed the relief supplies, also voluntarily reported that he had secretly hidden a coat and a pair of shoes. Everyone initially realized from an ideological point of view that the life-saving clothes donated enthusiastically by compatriots all over the country to their fellow sufferers in disaster areas were actually being stolen and exchanged for personal gain. This was a selfish act that lacked a mass perspective and violated the interests of the masses. The meeting decided that "the exchanged clothes, those that have already been distributed will be counted as distributed, and all the exchanged relief clothes will be taken off and distributed to the disaster victims." The district committee also expressed its attitude to the author, saying: The criticism of the author at the meeting on the 17th was unfounded and wrong. But they also said: "If there are any problems in the future, they should be raised in person, and don't 'report bad things' to the newspaper, otherwise people won't know how our district is doing?!"
    We feel that the handling of this matter by the Nan Zhao District Committee, under the instructions of the CPC Ying Shang County Committee, has basically reversed the erroneous attitude towards criticism, and only under the correct leadership of the Communist Party can this victory be achieved. But we still have a lot of questions that are not clear.
    Should we write articles in the future when we encounter such things? Is writing articles like this considered "reporting bad things"? Is stealing and exchanging disaster relief clothing a minor matter? Will launching criticism among comrades affect the unity, work and morale of cadres? If the production and disaster relief work in Nan Zhao District is not done well, should Gao Jianyi be responsible? Is it right for District Committee Secretary Fu Tongbo to be afraid of people seeing the shortcomings in his work? From Gao Jianyi's "I will not write articles anymore!" performance of self-criticism, is this a sign that criticism is being suppressed, and what kind of evil consequences will it bring? Is it right for Zhang Liangfu and others to scold people after being criticized?

### 中共颖上南照区委压制高建仪在报上批评干部作风

　　中共颖上南照区委压制高建仪在报上批评干部作风
    编者按：这封信发表在二月十日皖北日报上。这种压制批评的现象，不仅南照区存在，并且在另外一些地方也存在着，故特将原信加以转载并发表短评，希望各级党委对此普遍加以注意。各地均应认真贯彻中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定。编辑同志：
    一月十一日皖北日报读者园地栏刊载了《张良辅等偷换救济寒衣，请颍上县有关机关迅速处理》一文，十四日，该县南照区民政区员张良辅看到报后，便拍桌大骂“那个××的写的？”“写稿‘的赤光’（作者）是那一个？”他气还未息，想去新华书店买本画刊解解闷。可巧，张良辅走进书店门，听见有人正在读报上的“张良辅等偷换……”于是他一声不响地溜回区来，可是又碰到一个来打官司的妇女，有意无意地向他说“张区员还上报呢！”这真是“火上加油”，把张良辅气得一连骂了两天。十六日，当张良辅知道了写稿人是高建仪时，竟然气势汹汹地“寻上门”去责问，高建仪吓得不敢承认，于是张良辅就越是骂得起劲，并虚张声势的说：“赤光大概是国民党的吃拿队（土匪）！”这就吓得高建仪再不敢见他。
    中共南照区区委书记傅同波，也认为写稿人犯了严重的无组织、无纪律错误，这是瞧不起区委——这些“小事”区委还能解决不了吗？不然也可提交县委，不该“偷偷”地写稿向报社“告黑状”。区委书记就追问宣教干事“稿纸从那里来的？”“给那些人的？”“县委宣传部给稿纸，就叫写这些东西吗？”并要宣教干事负责任。在追出写稿人名字后，十七日，区委便召开会议专门研究这个问题。傅同波的意见是：“换救济寒衣的人当然不对，写稿人也是不对。”理由是高建仪不该改名字写稿；更不该不通过区委便自行投稿，致使“干部不团结”（？）“影响干部情绪”（？）“影响生产救灾工作”（？）写稿人高建仪在这种情况下，也就被迫作了检讨，但他说明了皖北日报通讯员纪律上有“批评当事人、负责人与领导机关，可不通过当事人”一条规定时，傅同波还不相信，一方面翻报纸找，又要写信问报社；一面亲自打电话问县委（区宣教干事已问过，回答“可以”，但区委书记仍不信），直至县委说：“这是党中央的决定，也就是要使当家的人民监督干部，办好自己事情的方法，这是合法的，应该的。”并指出他们打击批评写稿人是错误的。这样，十八日继续开会时，区委书记傅同波才检讨了领导上的检查不够，换救济寒衣的民政区员张良辅，民兵大队副陈文杰，公安干事刘国兴等也才相继检讨，管理救济物资的建设区员徐新民偷藏一件大衣、一双鞋子，也自动报告出来。大家从思想上初步认识到全国各地同胞从千万里外，热情地捐赠给灾区同胞的救命衣服，竟为个人着想，而偷换起来，这是没有群众观点的自私行为，是违反群众利益的，会议决定“换下来的衣服，已发下去的就算了，所换得的救济衣服一律脱下发给灾民。”区委也对写稿人表明态度说：十七日会上对写稿人的批评，是无根据的，错误的。但却又说：“以后再有问题，应当当面提出，不要到报社‘告状’，不然人家不知道咱区工作怎搞的？！”
    我们感到南照区委对这件事情的处理，在中共颍上县委的指示下，基本上已扭转了对待批评的错误态度，也只有在共产党的正确领导下，才能取得这个胜利。但我们还有一大堆问题不够明确。
    到底以后遇到这类事情该不该写稿？这样写稿算不算是“告黑状”？偷换救灾寒衣是不是小事情？同志间展开批评会不会影响干部团结、工作和情绪？如果南照区生产救灾工作搞不好，高建仪该不该负责？区委书记傅同波的怕人家看到自己工作中的缺点对吗？从高建仪检讨的“我以后不再写稿啦！”的表现中看，这样是不是批评遭受压制，会得到家说什么恶果？张良辅等被批评后骂人对不对？
