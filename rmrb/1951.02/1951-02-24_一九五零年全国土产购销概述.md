　　Overview of National Native Produce Purchase and Sales in 1950
　　Kang Weizhong
　　Vigorously purchasing and selling native products, enhancing farmers' purchasing power, and stimulating urban-rural trade, thereby promoting the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, is the most important link in the current economic work. The People's Government attaches great importance to this work. The local branches of the China Native Produce Company under the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government steadily relied on cooperatives and united private merchants in 1950 to carry out the purchase and sale of native products, and have achieved certain results.
　　China's output of native products and specialties is very rich, distributed in a wide range of regions, with about two thousand varieties, accounting for a large proportion of farmers' total income. Taking the Southwest Region as an example, native produce income accounts for 35% to 40% of agricultural income; the native produce income of Inner Mongolia is equal to the total value of agricultural income. According to a survey of twelve typical villages in North China, the income from native products and sideline occupations accounted for 28% of the total annual agricultural income before the war. The total value of native products in the Northeast accounts for more than 26% of the total value of agricultural production. If the output of national native products is estimated, the proportion is equivalent to about 30% of the total value of farmers' production.
　　In the past year, the People's Government, through the trade departments, carried out vigorous native produce purchase and sales work. According to incomplete statistics, the native produce company purchased more than 370 million catties of native products and put in more than 825 billion yuan in currency during the year. This has played a significant role in stimulating the rural economy, increasing farmers' purchasing power, and supplying industrial and agricultural production materials. At the same time, most of the operations were conducted through cooperatives, providing them with powerful conditions for development and growth.
　　The increase in the amount of purchase is inseparable from vigorous promotion. There are two sales channels for native products: one is to adjust domestic needs; the other is to export for foreign exchange. Last year, in terms of domestic adjustment, local native produce companies completed a total of more than 190 million catties, enabling a smooth exchange of native products between regions through promotion. For example, the total amount of six kinds of native products such as tobacco leaves, stibnite, gypsum, sugar, rosin, and star anise from Central South transported to North China totaled 3.5 million catties; the amount of four kinds of products transported to the Northeast, including rough-edged paper, hemp, melon seeds, and peach kernels, reached more than 3.59 million catties; on the other hand, the amount of goods transported into Central South from other regions included five kinds of products from North China, such as anemarrhena, radix rehmanniae, and bean vermicelli, totaling 250,000 catties, Sichuan lovage and pickled mustard tuber from the Southwest totaling 400,000 catties, and Chinese angelica, licorice, and notopterygium from the Northwest totaling 100,000 catties. In addition, there were large quantities of native products transported and sold by private merchants. In terms of organizing exports for foreign exchange, according to statistics from the native produce company, the total export of native products exceeded 100 million catties. The commodities exported by the native produce company were mainly bauxite, peach kernels, cinnamon, and handicrafts.
　　Due to the strengthening of urban-rural and domestic-foreign exchanges, and the revitalization of the market, not only was the production of industry and agriculture supported, but also the purchasing power of farmers was increased, and the lives of the masses were improved. According to a typical survey by the Hubei Provincial Native Produce Company in the Central South Region, the purchasing power in the Xiaogan Special District has increased by 25% after the export of native products; in the Daye Special District, a hemp-producing area, in 1949, a family of eight only bought one bolt of cloth for the whole year and ate only two and a half catties of salt per month. In 1950, they could buy four bolts of cloth for the whole year and eat three and a half to four catties of salt per month. At the same time, through the purchase and sale of native products, the living standards of the people in the Northwest and Southwest minority areas have also been improved. According to a survey by the Northwest Native Produce Company, Qinghai Province had already solved the clothing problem for 16% of the province's population last year, enabling people who were previously unable to eat their fill and keep warm to obtain adequate food and clothing. More importantly, by combining the purchase of native products with disaster relief work, last year in five disaster areas including northern Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu, a total of 16 million catties of 25 kinds of products such as tobacco leaves and medicinal materials were purchased, as well as more than 80 million feet of native cloth and 30 million reed mats, with a total currency investment of more than 130 billion yuan, which can be converted into 200 million catties of corn at the market price at that time, which can solve the full month's living problems for about 4 million people.
　　Last year's native produce operations proved that the key to native produce work lies in promotion. Because only active promotion can open up sales channels for native products, and only then can we expand capital and strengthen the power of purchase and sales. For example, before May last year, because the local native produce companies were not clear about the point that "promotion is the key," native products were piled up everywhere, affecting the turnover of funds. According to statistics, the funds tied up at that time were equivalent to more than 22% of the total amount invested throughout the year. This greatly affected the purchase, and some farmers even discarded some native products on the ground. However, since the National Native Produce Managers Conference in April, the policy of vigorous promotion was clarified, and the purchase and sale of native products was fully launched. Various places have also created many methods in promoting native products. These methods are: First, investigate local needs, and purchase according to sales volume. For example, the Jiangxi Native Produce Company purchased 140,000 catties of Jiangxi gypsum, 30,000 catties of Shandong red dates, 10,000 catties of Longkou bean vermicelli, 20,000 catties of Wuzhao dates from Pingyuan Province, and daylily, salted meat, and other categories according to the needs of the province. This method not only avoided blind purchase and sale and the accumulation of funds, but also actively opened up sales channels for native products. At the same time, we widely contact relevant departments to open up new sales channels and restore old sales channels. For example, after contacting the Yanjing and Renmin printing factories, the Beijing Native Produce Company learned that the two factories needed 7 to 8 tons of Guangdong rosin and alum per month. Another example is that Jiangxi tangerines had a bumper harvest last year, but suffered from the inability to sell them. Later, they were transported to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for trial sales, and the results were in short supply. The cool mats and umbrellas in East China were popularized in rural areas after trial sales in North China. In addition, various places have mutually established consignment business. For example, the Beijing Native Produce Company signed a consignment contract for lard and honey with the Tianjin office of the Northeast Trade Department. As a result, 20,000 catties of lard and 5,000 catties of honey were sold in half a month. After that, contracts were continued to be signed to vigorously promote sales.
　　Secondly, due to the characteristics of the large number of native products, complex varieties, vast areas, and decentralized production, the purchase and sale of native products must unite and use various forces. When organizing various forces, we must rely on cooperatives and unite private merchants. The method of establishing purchase and sales relationships between state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives in various places through contract systems is successful. According to statistics from North China from October to December last year, native products purchased through cooperatives accounted for 36.87% of the total purchase volume in the region. In terms of uniting private merchants, the experience of various places proves that: First, we should hold native product conferences or various forms of symposiums to dispel the concerns of private merchants, and sign material exchange contracts at the conferences. For example, the Anyang Special District in Pingyuan Province signed more than 1,300 trade contracts at one time after the meeting, which promoted the exchange of materials. The second is to organize private merchants to jointly purchase and sell, concentrate funds, and exert greater power. For example, the Guangdong Native Produce Company organized private merchants to jointly operate, which quickly promoted the sales of local rosin and cinnamon, thereby revitalizing the market. Third, state-owned trading companies appropriately reduce the scope of operations and encourage private merchants to freely purchase and sell. For this reason, the East China Native Produce Company reduced the original operations of more than 100 kinds of native products to 60 or 70 kinds; the Henan Native Produce Company transferred the businesses of monkey head, deer antler, cattail mats, and cattail fans, which were originally planned to be operated, to private merchants; and the Nanjing Native Produce Company closed 28 edible oil sales agencies and transferred the retail business to private merchants. In addition, private merchants are given consideration and convenience in terms of prices, taxes, loans, and transportation. Due to the consideration and unity of private merchants in all aspects, this has brought into play the power of private merchants. According to statistics on the proportion of transaction volume of 11 kinds of native products such as sulfur, medicinal materials, mountain goods, and stibnite in the market last year, private merchants accounted for more than 56%, and the transaction volume of straw braid accounted for more than 24%. According to statistics from the Central South State-owned Native Produce Company last year, the public and private sectors invested more than 157.84 billion yuan in the purchase of 17 kinds of native products such as tobacco leaves, rosin, stibnite, and gallnuts in the region, of which the proportion of private merchants' operations accounted for more than 89%. This proves that only by uniting private merchants can the purchase and sale of native products be done well.
　　Finally, grasping the purchase and sale prices of native products is the key to vigorously promoting native products, and it is also the most effective way to guide production. The characteristics of native products are that they are bulky, highly seasonal, and some native products are produced in remote rural areas or deep mountains and forests, and transportation conditions are difficult. Therefore, it is not only necessary to take care of the interests of the production, transportation, and sales parties, but more importantly, to take care of the interests of the transporters. Experience has proven that when the control of prices is biased, it is impossible to unite private merchants or satisfy farmers. For example, last year, the Northeast Native Produce Company purchased eggs for 4,500 yuan each (Northeast currency), which was more than double the production cost. As a result, due to market changes, the price fell to 2,300 yuan. At that time, private merchants did not purchase due to the high price, but the company lost a lot of money, and the farmers were still dissatisfied. On the other hand, when the Southwest Native Produce Company purchased gallnuts, it conducted a detailed investigation of production costs and market needs, and stipulated reasonable list prices. As a result, the public and private sectors purchased more than 80,000 dans, and private merchants accounted for 40% of the total purchase volume.
　　The basic link in grasping prices lies in correctly stipulating the price differences between regions to encourage private merchants to transport and sell over long distances. The purchase price of Wuzhao dates in Jinan, Shandong was 1,500 yuan, and the selling price in Shanghai was 2,000 yuan, which allowed private merchants to obtain reasonable profits and actively opened up the sales channels for Wuzhao dates. Conversely, when the Northeast Native Produce Company purchased eggs, although it determined the price differences between provinces, it ignored the price differences between railway lines and non-railway lines, and between cities and villages. As a result, it lost the role of leading and uniting private merchants from the price policy, which affected the sales of eggs.
　　Correct price policies can stimulate or restrict the production of native products, and improve the quality and specifications of native products. In the past year, good experiences have been gained in this regard, and painful consequences have also occurred, which deserve the attention of all places.

　　一九五零年全国土产购销概述
　　康伟中
    大力购销土产，增强农民购买力，活跃城乡贸易，从而推动工农业生产的恢复和发展，是当前经济工作中的最重要的一环。人民政府对这一工作是极为重视的。中央人民政府贸易部所属中国土产公司各地分支机构，在一九五○年曾稳步地依靠合作社和团结私商，进行土产的购销工作，并已获得了一定的成绩。
    我国土产和特产的产量非常丰富，分布地区很广，品种约有两千余种，占农民收入总值的比重很大。以西南区为例，土产收入占农业收入的百分之三十五至四十；内蒙古的土产收入和农业收入的总值相等。据华北十二个典型村的调查，土产、副业的收入，战前占农业全年收入的百分之二十八。东北土产的总值，占农业生产总值百分之二十六强。如以全国土产的产量估计，所占比重相当于农民生产总值的百分之三十左右。
    过去一年，人民政府通过贸易部门曾进行了大力购销土产工作。据不完全统计，一年来土产公司共收购土产品三亿七千余万斤，投放货币八千二百五十余亿元。这对活跃农村经济、提高农民购买力，以及对供给工农业生产资料上，均起了很大作用。同时在经营中大部分通过合作社，使合作社获得了发展与壮大的有力条件。
    收购量的增大是与大力推销分不开的。土产的销路有二：一是在国内调剂需要；二是出口换取外汇。去年在国内调剂方面，各地土产公司总计完成了一亿九千余万斤，通过推销而使地区与地区之间的土产达到畅旺的交流。如中南的土产烟叶、信石、石膏、糖、松香、大茴香等六种土产运销华北的总计在三百五十万斤；运销东北的计有毛边纸、麻、瓜子、桃仁四种达三百五十九万余斤；另一方面，从其他区运进中南的，计有华北的知母、生地、粉丝等五种二十五万斤，西南的川芎、榨菜共四十万斤，西北的当归、甘草、羌活计十万斤。此外，还有经过私商运销的大量土产。在组织出口换取外汇方面。据土产公司统计，出口土产总计一亿余斤。经土产公司输出的商品，是以矾土、桃仁、桂皮、手工业品等为主。
    由于加强了城乡、内外的交流，活跃了市场，不仅扶植了工农业的生产，而且提高了农民的购买力，改善了群众的生活。据中南区湖北省土产公司的典型调查，孝感专区的购买力在土产外销后，已经提高百分之二十五；产麻区的大冶专区的农民，在一九四九年，八口之家全年只买布一匹，每月吃盐两斤半，一九五○年全年可买布四匹，每月可吃盐三斤半到四斤。同时通过土产的购销，使西北与西南少数民族地区人民生活水平也提高了。据西北土产公司调查，青海省去年已经解决了全省人口百分之十六的穿衣问题，使从前吃不饱、穿不暖的人民，能够获得温饱。同时更重要的，通过收购土产结合了救灾工作，去年在皖北、湖北、河南、河北、苏北等五个灾区，统计收购烟叶、药材等二十五种达一千六百万斤，另有土布八千余万尺，芦席三千万条，共投放货币达一千三百余亿元，按当时市价折算可购玉米两亿斤，约可解决四百万人的全月生活问题。
    去年的土产经营中，证明土产工作的关键在于推销。因为只有积极推销才能打开土产销路，也才能扩大资金，壮大购销的力量。如去年五月份以前，由于各地土产公司对于“推销是关键”这点认识不清，因而各地土产堆积，影响到资金周转，据统计当时积压的资金相当于全年投放总量的百分之二十二还多。这就大大影响了收购，使农民有些土产甚或弃置于地。但自四月全国土产经理会议以后，明确了大力推销的方针，土产购销才全面展开。各地在推销土产中也创造了很多办法。这些办法是：首先，调查当地需要，量销为购。如江西土产公司根据该省需要，收购了江西石膏十四万斤，山东红枣三万斤，龙口粉丝一万斤，平原省乌枣两万斤，及金针菜、咸肉等类。这种办法既避免了盲目购销，积压资金，也主动地打开了土产销路。同时，广泛地与有关部门联系，打开新销路，恢复旧销路。如北京市土产公司与燕京、人民两印刷厂联系后，才了解该两厂每月需要广东松香、明矾各七、八吨。又如江西蜜桔去年产量丰收，苦于无法销售，后运到北京、天津等地试销，结果供不应求。华东的凉席、雨伞，试销华北后，普及农村。另外，各地互相订立代销业务，如北京土产公司与东北贸易部驻津办事处，订立猪油、蜂蜜代销合同，结果半月内销猪油两万斤，蜂蜜五千斤。其后继续订立合同，大力推销。
    其次，由于土产数量多，种类复杂，地区辽阔，生产分散等特点，所以土产购销必须团结与运用各种力量。在组织各种力量时，必须依靠合作社和团结私商。国营贸易机构通过合同制与各地合作社建立购销关系的办法是成功的。据去年华北十至十二月份的统计，通过合作社收购的土产占该区总收购量的百分之三十六点八七。在团结私商方面，各地的经验证明：首先应召开土产会议或各种形式座谈会，解除私商顾虑，并在会议上订立物资交流合同。如平原安阳专区经过会议，一次即订立了贸易合同一千三百余件，促进了物资的交流。第二是组织私商联购联销，集中资金，发挥了更大的力量。如广东土产公司组织私商联营，使当地的松香、桂皮很快地推销出去，从而活跃了市场。第三，国营贸易公司适当缩小经营范围，鼓励私商自由购销。华东区土产公司为此将原经营百余种的土产减少到六、七十种；河南土产公司将原计划经营的猴头、鹿茸、蒲席、蒲扇等业务让予私商经营；南京土产公司撤销二十八家食油代销店，将零售业务让与私商。此外，在价格上、税收上、贷款和运输上都予私商以照顾和方便。由于各方面照顾和团结了私商，这就发挥了私商的力量。据去年在市场购销硫磺、药材、山货、信石等十一种土产成交量比重的统计，私商占百分之五十六强，草帽辫成交量占百分之二十四强。又据中南区国营土产公司去年统计，该区在收购烟叶、松香、信石、五蓓子等十七种土产中，公私共投放货币达一万五千七百八十四亿元以上，其中私商经营的比重占百分之八十九强。由此证明，唯有团结私商才能把土产购销工作搞好。
    最后，掌握土产购销价格，是大力推销土产的关键，同时也是指导生产的最有效的办法。土产的特点是笨重，季节性大，加以有些土产产于偏僻的农村，或深山野林中，运输条件困难。因此，不仅照顾产、运、销三方利益，而更重要的要照顾到贩运者的利益。经验证明，凡掌握价格有了偏向时，既团结不了私商，也使农民不满。如去年东北土产公司收购鸡蛋每个四千五百元（东北币），超过生产成本一倍之多，结果因市场变化，价格落到二千三百元。当时私商因价高不收购，公司却赔钱很多，而农民还表示不满意。另一方面，西南土产公司在收购五蓓子时，详细调查了生产成本和市场需要，规定出合理的牌价，结果公私收购八万余担，而私商占收购总量的百分之四十。
    掌握价格的基本环节是在于正确地规定出地区间的差价，以鼓励私商长途运销。山东济南乌枣收价一千五百元，运到上海售价二千元，使私商获得合理利润，积极地打开了乌枣的销路。相反地，东北土产公司收购鸡蛋时，虽然确定了省与省之间差价，但忽略了铁路沿线与非沿线之间、城市与乡村之间的差价，结果就失去了从价格政策上领导和团结私商的作用，影响了鸡蛋的销路。
    正确的价格政策，且能刺激或限制土产的生产，并提高土产的品质、规格。过去一年中，在这方面取得了良好的经验，也产生过惨痛的恶果，值得各地注意。
