　　Great Anniversary of Sino-Soviet Friendship
　　Li Jishen
    February 14, 1950, was the great day on which the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou (Port Arthur), and Dalian (Dairen), and the Sino-Soviet Agreement on a Credit to the People's Republic of China. On this day last year, the people of China and the people of our great friendly nation, the Soviet Union, celebrated this major political and moral achievement in the history of Sino-Soviet diplomacy with unparalleled joy. This year on this day, our two countries' people should celebrate and praise the consolidation and development of this brotherly friendship with even greater joy and enthusiasm. In particular, we Chinese people feel that, thanks to the Soviet Union's friendship, cooperation, and assistance, we have not only consolidated the achievements of the people's revolution, but also, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, have courageously, rapidly, and systematically carried out the construction of all aspects of the new China. In just one short year, everything has shown remarkable progress and achieved tremendous results. Therefore, on this historically significant anniversary, we feel even more compelled to express our infinite admiration and gratitude to the great leader of the Soviet people, Marshal Stalin, to the correct foreign policy of the Soviet government, and to the sincere and reliable friendship of the Soviet people.
    The main content of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is to unite the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union to jointly resist aggression and ensure world peace and security as its highest goals. Therefore, Article 1 of the treaty makes this clear and forceful provision: "Both Contracting Parties undertake jointly to endeavor to take all necessary measures with the object of preventing a repetition of aggression on the part of Japan or any other state that may unite with Japan directly, or indirectly, in acts of aggression. In the event of one of the Contracting Parties being attacked by Japan or states allied with it, and thus being involved in a state of war, other contracting party will immediately extend military and other assistance with all the means at its disposal. Both Parties also declare their readiness to participate, in a spirit of sincere cooperation, in all international action aimed at ensuring peace and security throughout the world and will contribute their full share to the promptest achievement of that object." At the same time, in order to express the sincere and seamless Sino-Soviet friendship and alliance, Articles 3 and 4 of the treaty further clarify: "Neither of the Contracting Parties shall conclude any alliance directed againist the other Contracting Party or take part in any coalition or in any action or measure directed against the other Contracting Party." "The two Contracting Parties will consult with each other in regard to all important international questions affecting the common interests of China and the Soviet Union, guided by the interests of consolidating peace and universal security." All these clauses demonstrate that the Sino-Soviet alliance is a brotherly alliance. Because of this brotherly alliance, it not only helped the People's Republic of China greatly strengthen its anti-imperialist struggle and enhance its international status and prestige, but also greatly encouraged the people of all Asian colonies and semi-colonies, as well as the oppressed people all over the world, to rise up and wage a comprehensive, heroic, and fierce struggle against imperialist aggressors for their own national liberation and for lasting world peace and universal human security. Therefore, on this great day when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the other two related agreements were signed, the oppressed people of all Asia and the peace-loving people of the world expressed great joy and heartfelt congratulations.
    In the past year, the victories achieved by the Chinese people in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and the results achieved in diplomatic struggles in the United Nations have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this great treaty, and at the same time, they have demonstrated that our most reliable friend, the Soviet people, has faithfully implemented this great treaty by showing brotherly love. In the past year, the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the economic and cultural fields have also had many factual and successful manifestations in accordance with the provisions of the treaty and agreements. In particular, the recent announcement in newspapers and publications that the Soviet government has already transferred to the People's Republic of China without compensation all the property it obtained from Japanese owners in the Northeast, as well as the property in the former Beijing barracks, etc. This friendly, generous, and extremely fair measure further proves the sanctity of the spirit and letter of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related agreements, and smashes all the conspiracies and slanders of the imperialist warmongers to sow discord between the two countries; on the other hand, it is precisely enough to greatly advance the unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    As we celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the two related agreements, in addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the sincere friendship of our great ally, the Soviet people, all Chinese people should further recognize today's international situation, distinguish between enemies and friends, and distinguish between right and wrong. American imperialism is a destroyer of world peace and a great enemy that is invading the People's Republic of China. It wants to arm Japan, threaten China's security, support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, obstruct the liberation of Taiwan, and slander our country as an "aggressor" in the United Nations. All of these fully reveal that the American imperialist aggressors and the Chinese people are irreconcilable and cannot coexist in the world; on the other hand, the Soviet Union's consistent friendly attitude and behavior towards the Chinese people in history, as well as the tremendous assistance to the Chinese people under the Sino-Soviet alliance in the past year, stand in stark contrast to the hideous face and brutal actions of American imperialism's hatred of the Chinese people. In addition, we must recognize that the power of the Sino-Soviet alliance is the power of the unity of 700 million people, an invincible force capable of defeating all imperialists and guaranteeing lasting world peace and universal human security.
    Finally, let us shout:
    Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance!
    Long live the unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　中苏友好的伟大纪念日
　　李济深
    一九五○年二月十四日为中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟签订中苏友好同盟互助条约和中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口与大连的协定，以及中苏关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定的伟大日子。在去年的今天，全中国人民和伟大友邦苏联的人民，是用无比的愉快心情来庆祝中苏外交史上这一重大政治和道义上的辉煌成就。今年此日，我们两国人民对于这兄弟般友谊的巩固与发展，更加要欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝、来歌颂。特别是我们中国人民感觉到，由于苏联的友谊合作与帮助，使我们不仅巩固了人民革命胜利的成果，而且在毛主席和中国共产党领导下有勇气地、飞跃地、有计划地进行了新中国各方面的建设。短短一年中，一切一切表现了显著的进步，获得了巨大的成绩。因此，我们在这具有历史意义的纪念日，更觉得要对苏联人民的伟大领袖斯大林大元帅和苏联政府的正确外交政策以及苏联人民真挚可靠的友情，表示无限的钦佩和感激。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约主要内容：是团结中苏两个伟大国家的人民，共同反抗侵略，确保世界和平与安全为其最高目的。因此，在盟约第一条即作了这样明确而有力的规定：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。双方并宣布，愿以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量。”同时为了表示中苏友好同盟的真诚无间，盟约第三和第四条又加以明确规定：“缔约国双方均不缔结反对对方的任何同盟，并不参加反对对方的任何集团及任何行动或措施。”“缔约国双方根据巩固和平与普遍安全的利益，对有关中苏两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题，均将进行彼此协商。”这一切条款都说明了中苏同盟乃是兄弟的同盟，由于有了这种兄弟同盟，不仅帮助了中华人民共和国大大地加强了反帝斗争的力量，提高了它在国际间的地位与威望，而且大大地鼓舞了全亚洲各殖民地和半殖民地的人民以及全世界被压迫的人民都起来为自己民族的解放以及为全世界的持久和平与人类普遍安全而向帝国主义侵略者作全面的英勇的激烈斗争。所以在中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他两个有关协定签订的这一伟大日子，全亚洲被压迫的人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都表示了极大的欢欣与衷心祝贺。
    在过去一年中，中国人民在反抗美帝国主义的侵略斗争上所获得的胜利和在联合国中外交斗争上所获得的成果，都很明显地说明了是由于这伟大盟约所发生的效力，同时也就是说明了我们最可靠的朋友——苏联人民表现了兄弟般的友爱来忠实地执行了这一伟大盟约。在过去一年中，中苏两国关于在经济和文化上的互助合作，也都按照盟约和协定的规定，有了很多事实和成绩的表现，特别是最近报纸刊物上所公布的苏联政府业已无偿地向中华人民共和国移交了它在东北自日本所有者手中所获得的全部财产以及在过去北京兵营的房产等。这一友好慷慨又极其公道的措施，更证明了中苏友好盟约和有关协定的精神和文字的神圣，粉碎了帝国主义战争贩子们一切挑拨离间中苏两国感情的阴谋与诽谤；另一方面，正足使中苏两国间人民的团结与友爱要大大地向前推进一步。
    我们在庆祝中苏友好盟约和两个有关协定签订的第一周年纪念日，除了对伟大盟邦——苏联人民的真挚友情表示衷心感谢外，全中国人民应进一步地认识今天的国际形势，分清敌友，明辨是非。美帝国主义是世界和平破坏者，是侵略中华人民共和国的大敌人。它要武装日本，威胁中国的安全；扶助蒋匪帮，阻碍台湾的解放；并在联合国诬蔑我国为“侵略者”。所有这些，都充分表露了美帝国主义侵略者和中国人民是势不两立，无法共存于天地间；而另一方面，苏联对中国人民在历史上一贯的友爱的态度与行为，以及一年来在中苏同盟下对中国人民的巨大帮助，这与美帝仇视中国人民的狰狞面目及残暴行动，恰成强烈的对照。此外我们更要认清：中苏同盟力量是七万万人团结的力量，是不可战胜的力量，足可击败一切帝国主义者，来保障世界的持久和平和人类的普遍安全。
    最后让我们高呼：
    中苏友好同盟万岁！
    中苏两大民族团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
