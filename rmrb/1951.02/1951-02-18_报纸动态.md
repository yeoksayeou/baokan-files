Newspaper Updates

            Articles on "On Practice"
    Since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical work "On Practice," in addition to the articles broadcast by the Xinhua News Agency, local newspapers have published the following articles by their own staff or readers on this topic: Changjiang Daily published three short essays by Ma Tieding on January 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, each over a thousand characters long, entitled "After Reading On Practice," with the subtitles: "Without Entering the Tiger's Den, How Can One Catch the Cubs?", "Earnestly Study Revolutionary Theory," and "Investigation and Research." Chahar Daily published an article by Li Zhongying entitled "Gains and Insights from Studying Chairman Mao's 'On Practice'" in its special "Study" section on January 31st. Jiangsheng Daily (Xiamen) published an article by Nian Feng entitled "Studying 'On Practice' to Improve Work Summaries" in its "Study Life" column on February 3rd.
    Publishing insights from studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work and elaborating on its profound content from various perspectives is of great significance.

            Should Be More Cautious
    Chongqing Dagongbao published a "Summary of Studying 'On Practice'" on February 5th in response to readers' requests, listing some questions and references.
    It is the responsibility of newspapers to help the people study "On Practice" by various methods, but Chongqing Dagongbao's "Summary" has significant shortcomings. Some of the questions are inappropriate. For example: "How to connect dialectical materialism, materialist dialectics, historical materialism, and methodology when studying 'On Practice'?" Are dialectical materialism and materialist dialectics two different things? What is the significance of listing methodology separately from dialectical materialism and historical materialism? "On Practice" itself is the thought of materialist dialectics, so how can it be said to be "connected"? What is the use of such questions other than causing confusion among readers?
    In addition, the eleven "references" listed at the end of the article include five philosophical works ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of words, such as "Basic Problems of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" compiled by Bogu, which cannot be read by anyone in a short period of time. Such introductions are therefore unnecessary.
    The editors expressed due caution when publishing this summary—hoping to receive corrections, but it would have been better to be more cautious and correct those errors that could be corrected before publishing.

            Pay Attention to Letters from the Working People
    Northeast Daily published a notice from the Northeast People's Government on February 3rd on the first page, instructing its subordinate departments to improve the handling of letters from the people. The notice pointed out that some agencies "do not carefully read letters from the masses and solve problems, but mostly forward them as usual, and even some important letters are shelved and left unresolved for a long time." Therefore, the Northeast People's Government stipulated that handling letters from the people should be listed as a business in the secretarial work of each department, bureau, provincial, and municipal government, and appropriate personnel should be designated to be responsible for it. A serious and responsible attitude should be adopted towards letters from the masses. Systems should be established to regulate the methods and procedures for registration, transfer, urging, and inspection, and efforts should be made to reply in a timely manner to prevent backlog. The handling of letters must have results and must be notified to the sender, and reported to the head of the department on a monthly basis, and major events should be reported to the Northeast People's Government. The notice also stipulated: "In handling letters from the people, we should maintain regular contact with the social service department of the Northeast Daily and the departments of local newspapers that handle letters from the masses to obtain assistance."
    It is necessary to once again remind all levels of agencies and newspapers to pay attention to the work of readers' letters. New Hunan Daily published a criticism of the casual handling of readers' letters by the Hengyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ninth District Government of Hengyang County on February 5th, showing that some agencies still have an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards the voices of the working people. Various methods should be adopted—including criticism from public opinion and administrative methods—to fight to overcome this shortcoming.
    At the same time, newspapers should take all measures to strengthen the work of readers' letters. Shanxi Daily published various letters from readers on the entire first page on February 12th, and reprinted the Pravda editorial: "Treat Letters from Workers with Caution," requiring all departments to learn from it. Doing so is meaningful.

　　报纸动态
            关于《实践论》的文章
    毛泽东同志的理论著作《实践论》发表以后，各地报纸除了发表经新华社播出的几篇论文之外，发表自己或读者的这一类文章的已有以下几种：长江日报一月二十一日、二十二日、二十三日马铁丁著的三篇一千多字的思想杂谈，《读实践论之后》，题目是：“不入虎穴、焉得虎子”，《认真学习革命理论》和《调查研究》。察哈尔日报一月三十一日在专刊《学习》中发表了李钟英著的《学习毛主席〈实践论〉的收获和心得》。江声报（厦门）二月三日在学习生活栏中发表了年丰著的《学习〈实践论〉做好工作总结》。
    发表学习毛主席这一光辉著作的心得，从各方面将它的深湛的内容加以阐发，是有很大的意义的。
            应该更慎重一些
    重庆大公报二月五日适应读者的要求在报纸上发表了一个《学习〈实践论〉的提要》，列举了一些问题和参考文献。
    用各种方法帮助人民学习《实践论》是报纸应该担负的责任，但重庆大公报的《提要》却有很大的缺点，其中有的题目是不妥当的。例如：“学习《实践论》时怎样去联系辩证唯物论，唯物辩证法，历史唯物主义，思想方法论？”辩证唯物论和唯物辩证法难道是两个东西么？把思想方法论与辩证唯物论和历史唯物主义分别列出有什么意义？《实践论》本身就是唯物辩证法的思想，怎么能说是“联系”？这样的问题除了引起读者的混乱以外，又有什么作用？
    此外，在文末列举的十一种“参考文献”中，包括了五部十余万字直至数十万字的哲学著作，如博古编译的《辩证唯物论与历史唯物论基本问题》等，不是任何人能在较短时期内读得完的。这样的介绍也就没有什么必要了。
    编者在发表这个提要时，表示了应有的慎重——希望得到指正，但如果更慎重一些，在发表之前改正那些可以改正的错误，那就更好了。
            重视劳动人民的来信
    东北日报在二月三日第一版上刊登了东北人民政府指示所属部门改进处理人民群众来信工作的通知。通知中指出，有些机关“不认真阅读群众来信和解决问题，多是照例转送，甚至一些重要信件被搁置起来，无人负责，久悬不决。”因此，东北人民政府规定，应该把处理人民群众来信列为各部、局，各省、市政府秘书工作中的一项业务，要指定适当人员负责，对群众来信要采取认真负责严肃的态度来处理。要建立制度，规定登记、转办和催办检查的办法和手续，争取及时办复，防止积压。来信的处理要有结果，并须告知本人，同时按月向本部门负责人汇报，重大事件应报告东北人民政府。通知中并规定：“在处理人民群众来信工作中，应和东北日报社会服务部及各地报社之处理群众来信部门经常联系，取得协助。”
    再一次提醒各级机关和报社重视读者来信的工作是必要的。新湖南报二月五日发表了对中共衡阳县委会和衡阳县第九区政府轻率处理读者来信的批评，显示有些机关对待劳动人民的呼声还有着不可容忍的官僚主义态度，应该采取各种方法——包括舆论的批评和行政的方法，为克服这一缺点而斗争。
    同时，报纸也应该采取一切办法加强读者来信工作，山西日报二月十二日以第一版的全部篇幅发表了读者的各种来信，并转载真理报社论：《慎重对待劳动者来信》，要求各部门学习。这样做是有意义的。
