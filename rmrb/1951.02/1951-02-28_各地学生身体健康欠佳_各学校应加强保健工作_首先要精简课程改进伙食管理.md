　　Poor Health of Students in Various Regions
    Schools Should Strengthen Healthcare Work
  　Starting with Streamlining Curriculum and Improving Food Management
    [This newspaper dispatch] The widespread phenomenon of poor student health nationwide warrants serious attention. The primary cause of this phenomenon lies in the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang reactionaries only knew how to squeeze the people for their wealth, completely disregarding the people's health and failing to care for the health of young students. They even deliberately increased students' workloads to numb their minds, preventing them from thinking about political issues and participating in patriotic and anti-imperialist activities. Before liberation, students at Shanghai Jiao Tong University circulated a saying: "First year, buy candles; second year, buy glasses; third year, buy sputum cups; fourth year, buy coffins." The widespread phenomenon of poor student health was created under such circumstances.
    Today, the physical condition of general students remains extremely weak. For example, when 1,200 students from Nanjing University participated in military cadre school training, they underwent physical examinations, and only eight were completely free of disease. In Taiyuan City, only forty-two students were qualified, and only four were completely free of disease. In terms of primary school students, according to a survey in June last year, only 2,600 out of more than 20,000 primary school students in Fuzhou City were healthy. The remaining 80% were either unhealthy or ill, including more than 2,700 suffering from malnutrition, and most had trachoma, dental caries, swollen tonsils, and lymph nodes. According to a checkup in Beijing last September, 83% of more than 58,000 primary school students were unhealthy, with trachoma accounting for 40%, and skin diseases and dental caries each accounting for 30%. In Beijing and Shanghai, students with lung diseases accounted for 5% to 11% of the total student population. During the summer vacation last year, more than 40 graduates from Shanghai Jiao Tong University were unable to be assigned jobs due to lung diseases. Many students in various schools in Beijing also suffer from lung diseases. This situation seriously affects students' studies.
    Because teachers and students in New China actively demand progress and proactively request more teaching and learning, they neglect students' health. In universities, the general student's study time is 50 hours, and science, engineering, and medical colleges even exceed 50 hours. Because of the heavy workload, students have no choice but to burn the midnight oil. Some students at Chongqing Southwest Industrial College sleep in the laboratory. Some high school students study for about 60 hours a week, unable to finish the assignments left by teachers every day, and lack sufficient rest and sleep. As a student from Beijing No. 4 Middle School said, "At night, when I study, my brain is like a rotten egg, unable to absorb anything."
    Students' daily lives are irregular, and general schools do not pay enough attention to physical education courses. The physical education in some schools is still aimed at cultivating a few athletes. Insufficient attention is paid to environmental hygiene. Physical examinations are not strict enough when students enter school. Some students with infectious diseases enter the school, and appropriate isolation measures are not taken. The sanitary facilities in general schools are extremely poor, the air in the classrooms is not circulating, and teacups are shared. Many schools do not pay enough attention to food management, resulting in poor food quality. In Shanghai, some schools have porridge for one meal and dry rice for two meals a day, and in addition to vegetables, they can often eat some meat. However, some schools eat two meals of porridge and one meal of dry rice every day. Some schools in Kunming do not eat meat even once a month, while schools in Chongqing can eat meat once a week. This situation illustrates the importance of food management.
    Over the past year, the student health issue has attracted attention from all sides. The Central Ministry of Education has paid attention to streamlining the curriculum, and last spring, it called for spring plowing and production to improve food. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Health Bureau have organized school health committees. The first East China Higher Education Conference also specifically discussed the student health issue. The healthcare work in some schools has improved. In order to effectively and gradually solve this problem, schools at all levels and all educational workers must regularly pay attention to the amount of curriculum and homework, pay attention to students' daily lives, extracurricular activities, recreational and sports activities, strengthen food management, and improve the sanitary environment. Students should not only have rich knowledge but also possess strong physiques so that they can complete their tasks in national defense construction and economic construction.

### 各地学生身体健康欠佳  各学校应加强保健工作　首先要精简课程改进伙食管理

　　各地学生身体健康欠佳
    各学校应加强保健工作
  　首先要精简课程改进伙食管理
    【本报讯】目前全国学生不健康的现象，值得严重注意。产生这一现象的主要原因在于过去国民党反动派的长期统治。国民党反动派只知从人民身上搜括脂膏，绝不顾及人民的健康，不关心青年学生的健康，甚至为了麻痹学生思想，故意加重学生功课，使他们不能思考政治问题，不能参加爱国反帝的活动。解放以前，上海交通大学同学中流传着这样的话：“第一年买蜡烛，第二年买眼镜，第三年买痰盂，第四年买棺材。”学生不健康的普遍现象便是在这样的情况下造成的。
    今天一般学生的体质仍极衰弱。如南京大学同学一二○○人在参加军干校运动中曾举行了身体检查，完全无疾病的仅有八人；太原市学生合格的只有四十二人，完全无疾病者仅有四人。在小学生方面，据去年六月调查，福州全市两万多小学生中健康的只有二千六百多人，其余百分之八十的小学生都是不够健康或有病的，其中营养不良的有二千七百余人，大部分有砂眼、龋齿、桃扁腺及淋巴腺肿大等病。据去年九月北京市的检查，在五万八千余小学生中，百分之八十三是不健康的，其中砂眼占百分之四十，皮肤病和龋齿各占百分之三十。北京、上海两地患肺病的学生占全体学生的百分之五至十一。上海交大在去年暑期有四十多个毕业生因肺病无法分配工作。北京市各校学生患肺病的也不少。这种情况严重地影响了学生的学习。
    新中国的教师学生因为积极要求进步，主动地要求多教多学，以致忽略了学生的健康。大学里一般同学学习时间是五十小时，理工医学院还要超过五十小时。因为功课重，学生不得不开夜车。重庆西南工业专科学校有的同学在实验室内睡觉。高中学生有的每周学习时间六十小时左右，每天作不完教师留下的作业，休息不够，睡眠不足。如北京市立四中一同学说：“晚上自习脑子像坏了的鸡蛋一样，什么也装不进去。”
    学生日常生活不规律，一般学校对体育课程不够重视。有的学校的体育仍然是为了培养少数选手。环境卫生注意不够。学生入学时，体格检查不严。有的患传染病的学生进到学校里来，又没有进行适当的隔离工作。一般学校卫生设备极差，教室里空气不流通，茶杯公用。很多学校对伙食管理重视不够以致伙食很差。上海各校有的每天一顿稀饭，二顿干饭，蔬菜之外，还常常可以吃到一些肉类，但有的学校每天吃两顿稀饭一顿干饭。昆明有些学校一月吃不上一次肉，重庆的学校每星期可吃到一次肉。这种情况说明了伙食管理的重要。
    一年来学生健康问题已引起各方面的注意。中央教育部已注意精简课程，去年春季曾号召进行春耕生产，以改善伙食。北京市文教局与卫生局组织了学校卫生委员会。华东区第一次高等教育会议也特别讨论了学生健康问题。有些学校的保健工作有了改进。为了有效地逐步解决这一问题，各级学校及全体教育工作人员必须经常注意课程及作业的分量，注意学生的日常生活，课外活动，文娱体育活动，加强伙食管理，改善卫生环境。学生不但要有丰富的知识，而且要具备强健的体格，这样才能完成他们在国防建设和经济建设中的任务。
