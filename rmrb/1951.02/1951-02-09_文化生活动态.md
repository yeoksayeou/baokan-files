There are a total of 32 Russian language night schools in the Northeast region, with 11,000 students. Students in advanced classes have more than two years of Russian language foundation.

Russian language broadcast lectures have also been held in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanxi.

The Russian language tutoring class sponsored by the Xinjiang Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, including people from various ethnic minorities, had 90 students graduate in its first session.

Students with good grades have been able to read simple books and newspapers and engage in ordinary conversations.
