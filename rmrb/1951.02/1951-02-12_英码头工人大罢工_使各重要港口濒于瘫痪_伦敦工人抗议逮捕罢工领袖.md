Xinhua News Agency, London, 11th: Amidst rising living costs, dockworkers in major British port cities such as Liverpool, Birkenhead, Manchester, and London have successively launched large-scale strikes demanding wage increases since February 2nd. As of the 10th, the total number of striking workers has reached over 20,000. More than 200 ships in various ports have been forced to halt operations as a result, bringing the ports to the brink of paralysis. The strike initially broke out in the ports of Liverpool and Birkenhead on the evening of the 2nd. By the 5th, dockworkers in London had risen in response. The strikers organized and carried out their struggle autonomously, without the approval of the right-wing trade union leadership. The British Labour government, on the 9th, fabricated the charge of "conspiring to incite dockworkers to participate in illegal strikes" and arrested seven leaders of the London striking workers. The head of the reactionary Transport and General Workers' Union, Deakin, also took the opportunity to sabotage the strike under the pretext of "Communist instigation." However, the workers responded to the persecution by the Labour government and the scabs with even more determined actions. According to an Agence France-Presse report from London on the 9th, the number of London dockworkers participating in the strike was "rapidly increasing every hour," with the number of strikers in London alone increasing from 7,000 on the evening of the 9th to over 10,000 on the 10th. Reuters also acknowledged: "After the arrest of seven strike leaders, the striking workers firmly supported the strike... mainly to protest the government's legal measures." According to a Dentsu report, when the London court tried the seven arrested strike leaders on the morning of the 9th, many strikers marched through the city of London and gathered in front of the court to hold a protest demonstration. They held up signs reading "Stop this injustice!" and sang "The Internationale" to welcome the arrested strike leaders whom the court had to release on bail under mass pressure.

　　英码头工人大罢工

    伦敦工人抗议逮捕罢工领袖
    【新华社十一日讯】伦敦讯：在生活费用高涨的情况下，英国利物浦、柏肯黑德、曼彻斯特及伦敦等重要港口城市自二月二日起先后爆发了码头工人要求增加工资的大罢工。至十日止，罢工工人总数已达两万余人。各个港口中二百余只轮船已因此停驶，各港口濒于瘫痪。这次罢工首先是二日晚间在利物浦与柏肯黑德两港口爆发的。至五日，伦敦码头工人起而响应。罢工者并没有得到右翼工会领导机构的批准而自动组织起来进行斗争。英国工党政府竟于九日捏造了“阴谋煽动码头工人参加非法罢工”的罪名，逮捕了七名伦敦罢工工人的领袖；而反动的运输与各业工人工会的头目狄金也借口“共产党鼓动”，力图破坏罢工；然而，工人们用更坚决的行动来回答工党政府和工贼的迫害。据法新社伦敦九日消息，伦敦码头工人参加罢工的人数“每小时都在迅速增加”，伦敦一地参加罢工者已由九日晚的七千人增至十日的一万人以上。路透社亦承认：“在七个罢工领袖被拘捕以后，罢工工人们就坚决地支持罢工，……主要是为了抗议政府的法律措施”。据电通社报道，当伦敦法庭于九日晨审讯七名被捕的罢工领袖时，有许多罢工者在伦敦城内游行，并齐集在法庭门前举行抗议示威。他们高举着“停止这个不义的行为！”的标语牌，并高唱《红旗歌》，迎接那些在群众压力下法庭不得不批准保释的被捕的罢工领袖们。
