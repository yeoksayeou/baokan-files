    Soviet Experts Help Me Restore and Build Heavy Industry
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] In the past year, Soviet experts have been of great help to the restoration and construction of China's heavy industry. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts, most factories and mines have exceeded the production level of the Japanese puppet regime. By the end of 1950, the iron smelting furnaces in various places had all exceeded their original design capacity. Among them, the 250-ton iron smelting furnace in Shijingshan had created a record of 376 tons, and the 50-ton iron smelting furnace in Taiyuan had created a record of 106 tons. In terms of steelmaking, the Taiyuan Martin furnace adopted the hot charging method based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, which reduced the smelting time per furnace from 10 hours and 42 minutes to 5 hours and 55 minutes last year. This year, due to the adoption of the Soviet experts' air blowing smelting method, the smelting time per furnace was further reduced to 4 hours and 54 minutes. Last year, the Tianjin Martin furnace adopted the hot repair method of Soviet experts, reducing the furnace repair time from 180 hours to 60 hours, increasing efficiency by two times. Under the technical guidance of Soviet experts, the carbonization time of some coke ovens in Northeast China has generally been shortened from 24 hours to 18 hours, and some even to 16 hours, greatly increasing the coking rate.

    With the help of Soviet experts, many factories and mining equipment that were severely damaged during the war or abandoned for many years have overcome many difficulties and been restored. For example, a zinc smelting plant in a certain place was originally built by the Japanese puppet regime according to American design. It gathered thirty or forty Japanese experts and technicians to conduct experiments and research, but the result was a complete failure, and it had to be changed to a sulfuric acid plant. Last year, under the guidance of Soviet experts, it began to be restored, and zinc began to be produced in just half a year. The equipment for rolling steel rails in a steel plant in Chongqing has been abandoned for more than ten years, but with the help of Soviet experts, it has begun to roll heavy steel rails for the first time in China, enabling the Sichuan people's forty-year-old dream of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to begin.

    Soviet experts have also introduced many advanced enterprise management methods to improve our enterprise management. For example, they helped the state-owned heavy industry department establish planning agencies at all levels, began to use planning forms, and scientifically manage production; they helped establish statistical agencies, so that the central heavy industry department could grasp the production situation of steel plants across the country within 24 hours. For example, some factories and mines in Northeast China, with the help of Soviet experts, formulated detailed rules for each department and began to implement a responsibility system; they established a production dispatching room, which greatly promoted production. Many machine factories have implemented the "assembly line method" with the help of Soviet experts, greatly improving production efficiency.

    The serious, responsible, and tireless working spirit of Soviet experts has left a very deep impression on all our employees and has become a role model for them to learn from. For example, when a Soviet expert worked in Northeast China, he often got up in the middle of the night and braved the severe cold to climb to the top of the iron smelting furnace to check for problems. During the first hot repair of the Tianjin Martin furnace, Soviet experts personally guided the process and did not leave the workshop or sleep for two days and two nights.

### 苏联专家帮我恢复建设重工业

　　中苏两国人民的伟大友谊
    苏联专家帮我恢复建设重工业
    【新华社十三日讯】一年来苏联专家对我国重工业的恢复与建设工作帮助很大。由于苏联专家的帮助，大部分厂矿已突破日伪时期的生产水平。截至一九五零年年底，各地炼铁炉且均已突破原设计能力，其中石景山二百五十吨炼铁炉已创造三百七十六吨的纪录，太原五十吨炼铁炉已创造一百零六吨的纪录。炼钢方面，太原马丁炉接受苏联专家建议，采用热装法，曾于去年将每炉冶炼时间由十时四十二分缩短到五时五十五分；今年又因采用苏联专家的吹风熔炼法，使每炉冶炼时间再度降至四时五十四分。天津马丁炉去年采用苏联专家的热修法，修炉时间由一百八十小时减至六十小时，提高效率两倍。在苏联专家的技术指导下，东北若干炼焦炉的炭化时间，一般的已由二十四小时缩短到十八小时，有的甚至缩短到十六小时，大大提高了成焦率。
    在若干战时被严重破坏或弃置多年不用的厂矿设备，经苏联专家帮助，更克服了许多困难而恢复起来。例如某地炼锌厂，原是日伪根据美国设计建立起来的，集中了三四十个日本专家和技术人员，进行试验研究，结果完全失败，不得不改为硫酸厂。去年，在苏联专家的指导下，着手恢复，仅仅半年的时间便开始出锌了。重庆某钢厂轧制钢轨的设备已废置不用达十余年，但是经过苏联专家的帮助，已开始在国内第一次轧制重型钢轨，使四川人民仰望了四十年的成渝铁路得以动手修筑。
    苏联专家并介绍了许多先进的企业管理方法，改善了我国的企业管理。如帮助国营重工业部门建立各级计划机构，开始使用计划表格，科学地管理生产；帮助建立统计机构，使中央重工业部能够在二十四小时之内掌握全国各钢铁厂的生产情况。又如东北的某些厂矿，在苏联专家的帮助下拟定了各部门的工作细则，开始实行责任制度；建立了生产调度室，对生产起了很大的推动作用。许多机器厂在苏联专家帮助之下实行了“流水作业法”，大大地提高了生产效率。
    苏联专家认真、负责以及不辞辛劳的工作精神，已在我国全体职工中留下了极深刻的印象，并成为职工们学习的榜样。例如某苏联专家在东北工作时，经常半夜起床冒着严寒爬到炼铁炉顶上检查毛病。天津马丁炉第一次热修时，苏联专家亲自指导，曾两天两夜没有离开车间，没有睡觉。
