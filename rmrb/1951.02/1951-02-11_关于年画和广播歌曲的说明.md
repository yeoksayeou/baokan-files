    Explanations Regarding New Year Pictures and Broadcast Songs
    To the Editor:
    In the "Reader's Letters" section of the February 4th "People's Literature and Art," Comrade Wang Huadong's letter suggested that New Year pictures should include simple explanations to make it easier for readers to understand the content of the pictures. This suggestion is correct, and we will do so when printing New Year pictures in the future. In the past, the old New Year pictures did not have explanations, which had become a habit, so the new New Year pictures did not include explanations either. However, most of the old New Year pictures were of general subjects or historical events familiar to the masses, so readers could understand them without explanations. Now, the new New Year pictures mostly depict specific events or recently occurred events (of course, all are relatively typical events), and it is indeed necessary to add simple explanations to help the masses understand.

    Comrade Wang Huadong suggested in the previous issue of this publication that when broadcasting songs on the radio, the lyrics should be read aloud before broadcasting to help listeners understand the lyrics; when broadcasting operas, in addition to reading the lyrics, a brief explanation of the plot could also be provided. We believe this suggestion is good. The Central People's Broadcasting Station has decided that starting next week (that is, starting from the 11th of this month), when broadcasting new or relatively new songs, and songs with lyrics that are difficult to understand, the lyrics will be read aloud first; when broadcasting operas, if the lyrics can be understood, we also plan to read the lyrics before broadcasting. As for explaining the plot, we are already doing that.
    We do not advocate reading the lyrics before broadcasting every song, because this is unnecessary and may annoy listeners. We also do not plan to introduce the lyrics when broadcasting Peking Opera records, because most of these records have been popular for many years and the lyrics are not easy to understand. Even if they are read aloud, they will not be helpful to those unfamiliar with Peking Opera.

### 关于年画和广播歌曲的说明

专栏：读者来信

    关于年画和广播歌曲的说明编辑同志：
    二月四日《人民文艺》上“读者来信”栏内发表了王化东同志的来信，要求年画要附加简单说明，更便于读者了解画的内容。这个意见是正确的，我们将于今后印年画时这样做。过去印的旧年画上面都没有说明，已经成为一种习惯，所以新的年画上面也就不印说明，但是旧年画多半是一般性的题材，或者是历史上为群众所熟悉的事件，不加说明读者也可以了解。现在新的年画多半画的是一个具体事件或者是新近发生的事件（当然都是比较典型的事件），确实有必要附加简单的说明，以帮助群众了解。
                                            人民美术出版社编辑同志：
    王化东同志在上期本刊建议广播电台广播歌曲时，为了使听众听懂歌词，在广播前把词念一遍；广播戏曲时，除了念词，还可以简单地说明情节。我们认为这个建议是好的。中央人民广播电台决定从下星期起（就是从本月十一号起），在播送新的或是较新的，以及歌词不容易听懂的歌曲时，先念一遍歌词；在播送戏曲时，如果唱词可以听懂，也准备在播送之前，把词念一遍。至于说明情节，现在已经这样做了。
    我们不主张在播送每一歌曲之前都要先念唱词，因为这是没有必要的，还会引起听众的厌烦。在播送京剧唱片时，也不准备介绍唱词，因为这些唱片绝大多数已流行多年，唱词也不通俗，即使念了，对那些不熟悉京剧的人，也不会有什么帮助。
