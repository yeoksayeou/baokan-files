    Question: What kind of organization is the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association? What is its work?
    Answer: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a broad united front mass organization aimed at enhancing and consolidating the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and promoting the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations. Its National Headquarters was established in October 1949. Its daily basic work is to systematically guide the broad masses of members and non-members to deeply understand and learn from the Soviet Union through various means such as lectures, gatherings, publications, films, photo exhibitions, and Russian language teaching.
    Question: What is the organizational structure of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association?
    Answer: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has a National Headquarters, with branches in major administrative regions, provinces, cities, and counties, and sub-branches in local grassroots units (such as factories, government offices, schools, and rural areas). Currently, three major administrative regions (Northeast, Central-South, Southwest), twenty-three provinces, six administrative areas, thirteen municipalities directly under the Central or major administrative regions, and sixty-five cities under the jurisdiction of provinces or administrative areas have established branches. According to statistics from last November, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has 3,313,799 members nationwide. The organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Northeast and North China has gradually expanded from cities to vast rural areas.
    Question: What are the requirements for joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association? What procedures are required?
    Answer: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a broad united front mass organization. Therefore, all Chinese people who enjoy civil rights, as long as they agree with the aims of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, are willing to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship, and learn from the Soviet Union, regardless of class, party affiliation, religious belief, or gender, can join as members. There are two types of members: individual members and group members. Individual members can apply for membership to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization in their unit (government office, factory, school, street, rural area) and sign the membership application form (if there is no Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization in the unit, contact the local city or county Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to initiate organization). Units of the People's Liberation Army join as group members and do not recruit individual members. Trade unions, farmers' associations, youth, women's, and student organizations, as well as cultural, educational, and scientific organizations, can also join as group members at their grassroots level (such as government offices, factories, schools, and rural areas), but must be discussed and approved by the members of the group through a written resolution before applying for membership.
