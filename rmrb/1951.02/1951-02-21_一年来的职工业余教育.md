One Year of Employee Continuing Education

I. Overview

Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and with the vigorous promotion of governments, trade unions, and relevant organizations at all levels, as well as the active efforts of all working comrades, employee continuing education nationwide has made great progress in the past year. According to incomplete statistics from December 1950, out of 11,592,005 employees nationwide, 1,473,636 had participated in continuing education, accounting for 8.66% of the total number of employees, an increase of 215,474 people compared to the 789,262 participants at the time of the First National Conference on Worker-Peasant Education in September 1950. Industrial workers constitute the majority of the students. For example, in Zhangjiakou City, out of a total of 6,842 employees participating in learning, industrial workers accounted for 85%. In Beijing (according to statistics from September 1950), industrial workers accounted for 64.9% of all enrolled employees.

According to statistics from December 1950, the number of employee enrollments in major administrative regions is as follows:

According to statistics from September 1950, the number of employee enrollments in several major cities is as follows:
    Region      Total Number of Employees       Number of Employee Enrollees      Percentage of City Employees  Remarks
    Shanghai    1,032,756                     73,543                         7.12
    Tianjin        324,000                     40,361                         12.46         According to Dec. 1950 stats,
                      the number of enrollees
                      is already 71,754
    Beijing        330,818                     32,704                         9.89          According to Dec. 1950 stats,
                      the number of enrollees
                      is already 47,000
    Luda           118,164                     45,641                         38.63
    Wuhan          230,000                     22,713                         9.88
    Xi'an            67,700                     2,015                         2.97
    Total          2,103,438                   216,977                        10.31
The above figures indicate that the development of employee continuing education is uneven across different regions. This is mainly due to the different times of liberation in various places, and the varying quality of the work foundation and conditions. Even within the same region or city, the development is uneven due to the above reasons, as well as the importance attached by leadership and the level of subjective effort of cadres. For example, in the North China region, according to statistics from July 1950, the number of enrolled employees in Hebei Province accounted for 10.65% of all employees, while in Suiyuan Province it was only 2.04%. There is also uneven development between industries. For example, according to statistics from Northeast China in September 1950, the number of participants in the railway system accounted for about 50% of all employees, while in the coal mining system it was less than 20%. Taking only Luda as an example, the literacy campaign has been underway for nearly two years, and in some factories the number of enrollees has reached over 90% of all employees (with all illiterate workers enrolled), but in some factories the number of enrolled employees is only about 30%.

In terms of learning organization forms, employees' cultural education can be divided into two types: centralized continuing education schools and decentralized literacy classes/groups (such as workshop learning). Centralized continuing education schools can be further divided into several types: those run by a single large factory, mine, enterprise, or organization; those jointly run by several neighboring factories, mines, enterprises, or organizations; and those attached to schools or cultural centers at various levels. Classes are generally divided into ordinary classes, intermediate classes, and advanced classes, which include different levels ranging from literacy to high school graduation.

As for employee cultural textbooks, since 1949, regions such as major cities like Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Luda, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Harbin, the Northeast Administrative Region, and Henan Province have compiled a set of textbooks. At the national level, there are the elementary and intermediate textbooks for employee continuing education published by the Workers' Publishing House. The above textbooks were edited by the propaganda departments of the Party committees or the cultural and educational departments of the government in conjunction with the cultural and educational departments of the trade unions, or by organizing a group of primary and secondary school teachers to edit them during vacations, or by established specialized editorial institutions (such as in the Northeast). The editing methods include: (1) self-compilation; (2) selecting materials from newspapers and periodicals for compilation; (3) deleting and streamlining existing textbooks; (4) reprinting textbooks from other regions for temporary use. Most of the textbooks that have been compiled are for use in elementary classes at the elementary school level (Chinese language, arithmetic), followed by intermediate class textbooks at the higher elementary school level (including Chinese language, arithmetic, general knowledge), and advanced class textbooks at the middle school level, which generally use streamlined versions of middle school or worker-peasant accelerated middle school textbooks. Beijing once selected a loose-leaf anthology for use in advanced class Chinese language courses. In short, although elementary and intermediate cultural textbooks have been available since 1949, initially meeting the needs of employee education, they are not yet fully complete in quantity or high enough in quality.

Political and ideological education has been carried out in various places since liberation and has not been interrupted for the past year. Generally, large lectures (regular or irregular) are held to explain current events and current tasks, combined with the problems of employee thinking and production. Teaching materials are mostly taken from newspapers or special reports are made by specialized personnel, supplemented by other forms of publicity and education activities. In the past stage of political enlightenment education, various places generally conducted lectures on the laws of social development, as well as worker class education, political education, trade union organization, and internationalism education. This has played a significant role in raising employees' political awareness, establishing new labor attitudes, and developing cultural and technical learning on this basis. Political and ideological education after enlightenment is developing in the direction of in-depth and systematic learning; and since the US imperialist aggression against Korea, various places have universally carried out current affairs education to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Through this study, a patriotic production competition has been universally launched. Beijing workers proposed "Adhere to work, obey organization," and employees in other regions also expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect the country and defend our homes.

Technical education has also developed in the past year. The most common way is to improve operational skills through "master-apprentice contracts" and on-site learning; at the same time, higher-level technical theory learning is carried out through continuing technical schools and technical lectures. Technical textbooks are compiled by each enterprise according to the nature and work of each enterprise.

II. Achievements and Gains

The main achievements and gains of employee continuing education in the past year are reflected in the following aspects:

(1) Clarified the guiding principles of employee continuing education and established a unified leadership organization. In April 1950, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a symposium on employee continuing education in nine major cities, and preliminary exchanges of views were made on a number of major issues. On June 1, the State Council issued the "Instructions on Carrying out Employee Continuing Education," which, based on the current situation, clearly stipulated the guiding principle of focusing on cultural learning and emphasizing literacy education. In September, the Ministry of Education of the Central Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the First National Conference on Worker-Peasant Education, which further formulated implementation measures for employee continuing education and organizational regulations for employee continuing education committees at all levels; this has a decisive effect on the correct and widespread development of future work.

(2) Improved the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. After learning, employees' political awareness has been generally improved. They generally understand the principle of "labor creates the world" and have established the idea that the working class is the leading class and the master of the house. In international issues, they have also distinguished the two major camps and clarified the meaning of "leaning to one side." On the basis of political awareness, new labor attitudes have been established, and a high degree of enthusiasm and work initiative has been demonstrated in the recovery and development of production. The following are just a few examples from many: For example, from January to April 1950, the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Luda completed 117.20% of the spinning task and 112% of the weaving task; in terms of quality, first-class products accounted for 97%, and third-class products accounted for only 0.07%; in terms of cost, it was also reduced by 4%. Also, Liu Xiaohei of Tianjin Steel Plant and Wang Jiazong of Cotton Textile Factory No. 5 are not only learning models but also production models.

(3) Employees have gained preliminary literacy skills. After learning, the vast number of employees has begun to be able to use the written tool to acquire cultural and scientific knowledge and improve political understanding. In the words of the workers themselves, they have "truly opened their eyes." In the literacy learning general inspection in Luda in August 1950, a total of 8,686 employees in the whole district participated in the graduation examination, and 6,891 passed the graduation, accounting for 79.50% of the number of examinees. Among them, the Jinzhou Textile Factory has had 1,050 people complete the task of learning 1,200 characters from March 1949 to June 1950. According to materials from various places, generally illiterate workers can learn about 300-400 characters in three or four months, and after five or six months of learning, they can almost all write notes, read notices, keep accounts, and some can even write simple wall newspaper articles. Individually, such as Liu Meilan, a young female worker in Luda, a special literacy model, learned 2,000 characters in one year and can now write work reports.

(4) Improved the production technology level of employees. Cultural and political learning has created conditions and enthusiasm for the vast number of employees to study technology and improve technology. There are countless examples of improving production technology through learning. For example, students of the Tianjin Tram Company's continuing school understood the principle of air pumps from the explanation of atmospheric pressure; workers of Renli Woolen Mill could calculate the length of the belt according to the diameter of the pulley when installing pulley belts after learning the circumference. For example, the Workers' Continuing School of Fushun Mining College, with a total of 279 students, created 478 new production records in more than a year; especially worth mentioning is that the China Changchun Railway cultivated eight female drivers and stokers, including Tian Guiying. This is an unprecedented initiative in China, and it has opened up a glorious road for women in New China to participate in heavy industry construction.

(5) A large number of worker cadres have been trained. In conjunction with the organizational education of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, from 1947 to the end of 1949, the Northeast region alone trained tens of thousands of worker cadres. For example, a mining area in Jixi trained more than 1,200 cadres above the pit and section chief level and above the trade union committee level; Harbin City trained more than 3,800 cadres above the level of trade union branch director and enterprise management and political power cadres. For example, one district of Shijiazhuang City trained and promoted 335 cadres in 1950 through learning. Xie Shishan, a worker at the Luda Ice Factory, was able to read simple technical books due to his literacy, and his technical level gradually improved. He constantly put forward rationalization proposals and was promoted to deputy factory director in October 1949.

The achievements and gains of employee continuing education in the past year are the main aspects. However, there have been or still exist some shortcomings and problems, such as some regions' leadership is not paying enough attention or the implementation policy is not clear enough, the government, trade unions and other relevant departments cannot fully exert the effectiveness of "unified leadership, division of labor and cooperation," and many miners still cannot get a guarantee of learning time. There is a lack of teachers in quantity and quality, a lack of unified and appropriate teaching materials, and there are difficulties in funding or uneven distribution and a lack of comprehensive planning for use, etc. These have affected the development of the work to a certain extent. However, at the First National Conference on Worker-Peasant Education in September 1950, these problems were mostly reached a consensus on the understanding, and the way to solve them has been opened.

III. Experiences on Several Major Issues

In the past year, employee continuing education has created many experiences under the joint efforts of leaders and cadres at all levels and the broad masses of employees. The following is a brief description of the experiences on several major issues:

(1) The general law of development of employee continuing education is to transform from political enlightenment education to cultural education as the main focus, and appropriately combine political and technical education.

In the early days of liberation, it was very necessary to conduct a period of political enlightenment education in a widespread and concentrated manner. This is a historical task of transitioning from the old society to the new society and transforming the basic political understanding of workers who were deceived and blinded by the old society. However, when employees have a basic understanding of major issues such as the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the working class and the bourgeoisie, the peasant class and the landlord class, the Soviet Union and US imperialism, and trade union organizations have been established, and the recovery or development of production has been brought into line, it is necessary to gradually transform to cultural learning as the main focus, appropriately combining political and technical education. If it still remains in the stage of political enlightenment education, employees' interest in learning will be reduced, which will affect the further development of employee continuing education. If a worker does not have the ability to read, write and calculate initially, it is impossible to systematically improve his political and technical level. The content and teaching methods of cultural education must also fully express and relate to the actual life of employees and the current political struggle tasks. The interim implementation measures for employee continuing education passed by the Worker-Peasant Education Conference in 1950 are a summary of this experience. The general principle is: to learn culture in fixed spare time, to learn technology through the production process (mainly operational technology), and political education is carried out outside of cultural learning time through special reports, lectures, current affairs learning, various meetings, mobilization work, commemorative days and entertainment activities, etc.; employees with a considerable level of education can specially organize higher-level political classes and technical classes to carry out political and technical learning systematically.

(2) Arousing the attention of factory and mining administrative leaders, improving the leadership organization, and doing a good job of mobilization are three important links in carrying out employee continuing education.

Whether factory and mine administrative leaders attach importance to it is the key to whether the work of employee continuing education can be carried out smoothly. First of all, efforts must be made to make factory and mine administrative leaders have sufficient understanding of the great political significance of employee continuing education, and fully understand that strengthening worker education and improving worker culture is a necessary condition for consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship, establishing a strong national defense force and economic strength; it is also the personal requirement of the broad masses of employees. Only by attaching importance to and helping workers' learning in many ways can the enthusiasm of workers in production be enlightened, and it is possible to improve technology, improve labor productivity, and be more conducive to production. For example, the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Luda and the Dalian Match Factory, etc., have achieved great results in the literacy campaign due to the importance attached by the leadership and the guarantee and assistance in learning time and equipment (the plan is to eliminate illiteracy in the whole factory within two years), and the production tasks can also be completed smoothly.

To improve the leadership organization, it is necessary to implement the principle of "government leadership, relying on trade unions, and uniting relevant parties." Establish a truly worthy employee continuing education committee, and earnestly realize "unified leadership, division of labor and cooperation," overcome departmentalism, and correct the bias of paternalistic style or mutual shirking of responsibility. Employee education is a mass learning movement of an amateur nature. If the Party, government, trade union, and league do not conscientiously take responsibility, divide labor and be responsible under a unified plan, keep pace and maintain close contact, but only like symposiums or joint meetings, they will attend if they have time, and will not attend if they are not happy, without preparing or considering in advance, and only express some opinions temporarily, it is impossible to do this work well. The facts of the past year prove that the areas that have correctly implemented and implemented this policy have done a good job; the areas where the implementation is not serious or there are deviations have suffered a certain degree of loss in the work.

Since employee continuing education is a mass learning movement, it is necessary to do a good job of mobilization, first mobilize employees, and then add arduous and meticulous organizational work, and pay attention to continuous mobilization to consolidate and develop their learning emotions. Workers learning culture is a cultural emancipation of workers, and it is their own business. They must rely on the workers themselves to do it. If the workers themselves have not realized the importance of learning culture and lack the consciousness and enthusiasm for learning, they will never be able to do it well, let alone persevere. In the past year, various places have aroused workers' learning consciousness by complaining about the bitterness of culture, encouraged learning by using dramas, songs, wall newspapers, etc., and selected learning models by the masses. These are all successful ways to encourage workers' learning emotions. On the contrary, if the leadership has good motives, but does not patiently carry out in-depth mobilization work, and the methods are simple and the orders are issued from top to bottom, the work can be barely started for a while, but it is difficult to consolidate and last.

(3) The organizational form of learning must adapt to the production and living conditions of the masses, be flexibly applied, and at the same time must have a certain teaching plan and work system.

Local experiences have proved that the determination of the organizational form of learning must be based on two principles: first, the organizational form of learning must adapt to the production and living conditions of the workers; and second, no matter what form, there must be a certain teaching plan and work system. This takes into account the needs and possibilities of the workers, and also takes into account the actual effectiveness of teaching. The centralized form generally has good teaching results, but it has limitations (restrictions on teachers, school buildings, equipment, etc.); therefore, although it is the main form, it should not be the only form. The decentralized form can make full use of all conditions, adapt to people, time and place, and make workers feel simple and easy to implement; this point is generally under-recognized at present, and there is a phenomenon of neglect, which should be paid attention to.

However, decentralized learning must also have a teaching plan and a necessary work system; that is to say, there must be unified leadership, supervision, inspection, help, instructions, and summaries. Precisely because it is decentralized, it is even more necessary to grasp it tightly. Otherwise, it is easy to flow freely and cannot maintain the planning and regularity of learning; therefore, it will reduce the learning effect, reduce the learning emotions, and even lose the confidence in learning. It is best to conduct centralized mobilization and convey teaching plans, inspect work, summarize experiences, hold tests, commend achievements, and introduce good models or learning experiences on a regular basis. Experience has proved that this has a great effect on the encouragement of learning emotions and the improvement of learning effects.

(4) Mobilizing teachers among factory and mine employees is the basic direction for solving the problem of teachers for employee education.

Experience in the past year has proved that mobilizing teachers among factory and mine employees is a good way to solve the problem of teachers; at the same time, without a certain number of qualified full-time teachers, it is difficult to run worker continuing schools well. In the early stage of carrying out the literacy campaign in the Luda area, workers were mobilized to hold a cultural complaint conference, inviting employees to participate, which not only stimulated the workers' learning awareness and enthusiasm, but also deeply moved the employees, who believed that helping workers to become literate and learn culture was their glorious responsibility. At that time, many employees signed up, and later they were officially hired by the leadership. The characteristics of this kind of teacher are that they are familiar with the workers' lives, thoughts and production situation; they are conscious, active and enthusiastic. Employees who serve as teachers make workers and employees have a teacher-student relationship in addition to their work relationship, which can close the ties between them and strengthen friendship and unity. At the same time, while employees are educating workers, they will naturally learn from workers their excellent qualities and styles, which can promote their own progress. Teaching and learning promote each other, which is of great benefit to employees.

The main shortcomings of these volunteer teachers are: lack of teaching experience, and the general cultural level is not high. Therefore, how to cultivate and improve them is an important issue. Localities have accumulated a lot of experience in this regard: such as (1) holding teacher training classes that are separated from production or amateur, and providing short-term education in business, politics or culture to different targets according to different situations and requirements. (2) Implementing a collective lesson preparation system and holding regular teaching seminars to summarize teaching experience. (3) Holding teacher-student seminars, absorbing workers' opinions, and exchanging teaching experiences. (4) Establishing a commendation and reward system, giving honorary or material rewards to those who are enthusiastic about teaching and have achievements, or giving them certain subsidies.

In addition, allowing a small number of full-time teachers to participate in trade union work and become familiar with the workers' lives and production situation also has a great effect on improving full-time teachers and strengthening their teaching business.

(5) Guaranteeing learning time and properly solving the problem of funding are important conditions for carrying out employee continuing education.

Workers' learning time often cannot be fully guaranteed, which is the most important practical problem encountered first in carrying out employee continuing education. This problem is related to leadership thinking, production tasks, labor organization, and the work of all aspects of the Party, government, trade union, and league, and is a concentrated expression of various contradictions, which is quite complex. However, the facts prove that the proper solution to this problem is an important condition for carrying out and consolidating workers' learning, otherwise everything will fall through. For example, in some factories and mines in Pingyuan Province, workers' production time once even reached twelve hours, which seriously affected or even fundamentally hindered the holding of employee continuing education. For example, a cotton textile factory in Tianjin added one hour of overtime (eleven hours) every day in March last year. Workers were too tired and had no time to study, which affected the continuing school to the point of collapse. Local experiences have proved that the longer the working hours, the more the productivity is relatively reduced, and the more the cost is increased. In addition, due to the lack of comprehensive planning for the arrangement of work by the Party, government, trade union, and league systems, or too many meetings and activities, or complex labor organization (such as frequent shift work), the learning time is greatly affected. The leaders of these systems should fully consider, comprehensively study, and adapt or adjust the labor organization in accordance with the principle of not affecting production and the health of employees, reasonably allocate spare time, streamline meeting activities, and stipulate unified study days, etc., in order to effectively solve the problem, otherwise employee learning will not be consolidated.

The main problems with funding at present are "uneven distribution" and a lack of comprehensive planning for use. As long as the administrative side or the capitalists can allocate cultural and educational funds to the trade union in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law, and the trade union organization can seriously use them in accordance with the methods published by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the municipal employee continuing education committees can comprehensively consider the overall plan as a unit of the city, make appropriate adjustments, and the government can provide certain necessary subsidies, the problem of funding for employee continuing education can generally be solved.

(6) Employees' continuing cultural education should have unified (not according to enterprise industry), language teaching laws-based, and pay attention to the characteristics of adult teaching materials.

Experience in the past year has proved that workers in different enterprise industries only need to closely link the commonly used words in their production and daily life in the textbooks when they first become literate to help them remember and facilitate application; but the commonly used words in each enterprise industry are limited, and the purpose of workers' cultural learning is to master the written tool and systematically improve their cultural and knowledge level, and they cannot and should not be trapped in the narrow scope of the daily application of the enterprise or industry itself. Therefore, the higher the cultural level of employees, the smaller the difference between enterprise industries in teaching materials. This shows that the cultural education teaching materials for employees should be basically unified. Supplementary teaching materials can be compiled separately for the special needs of each enterprise industry. Those who advocate that workers' learning must be combined with practice, and can "learn and use immediately" to consolidate their learning emotions; each enterprise industry has different production situations, so teaching materials must be compiled separately to facilitate combining with practice. This reason is not comprehensive and sufficient.

Experience in the past year has also proved that literacy cultural teaching materials should be based on the laws of language teaching. The correct understanding of "culture combined with politics" should be to strictly require the correctness of the position and viewpoints in the textbooks, and fully permeate the content of political and ideological in the textbooks, and should not require the cultural teaching materials to include systematic political knowledge. Because cultural learning and political learning are the relationship between tools and purposes, only by laying a cultural foundation can it be systematically improved in politics, so improving culture itself is a political task. When editing literacy cultural teaching materials, if we cannot base on language and simply heap up political slogans and nouns, and think that speaking more politics in language is the combination of culture and politics, so that cultural textbooks become political textbooks, and cultural classes form political classes, it is actually a bias.

Experience has also proved that the literacy and cultural teaching materials for employees must pay attention to the characteristics of adults. In the teaching materials, on the one hand, attention must be paid to mastering the principle of being simple and easy to understand, and gradually enlightening their interest in knowledge. There is no need to repeatedly explain the things that adults are already familiar with; on the other hand, attention must be paid to taking care of their poor memory. For example, literacy teaching materials must pay attention to the average number of new words in each lesson and the number of times a single word appears repeatedly; for example, in the part of arithmetic integer four operations, because adults already have the ability to do mental arithmetic, the explanation should be concise, and the words in the example questions should not be too many.

　　一年来的职工业余教育
  　一、概况
    全国职工业余教育，在中央人民政府、中华全国总工会的正确领导下，在各级政府、工会及有关机关团体的大力推行和全体工作同志的积极努力下，一年来有了很大开展。据一九五○年十二月份不完整的统计，全国一千一百五十九万二千零五名职工中，已有一百万四千七百三十六人参加了业余学习，占职工总数百分之八·六六，较一九五○年九月全国第一次工农教育会议时参加学习人数七十八万九千二百六十二人已增加二十一万五千四百七十四人。学员中以产业工人占大多数。如张家口市参加学习的职工共六千八百四十二人，产业工人就占了百分之八十五。北京（据一九五○年九月份统计）产业工人参加学习的占全体入学职工的百分之六四·九。
    根据一九五○年十二月份统计，各大行政区职工入学人数如下表：
    据一九五○年九月份统计，几个主要城市的职工入学人数如下：
    地区      职工总数           职工入学人数    占全市职    备注工的百分比
    上海    一、○三二、七五六   七三、五四三    七·一二
    天津        三二四、○○○   四○、三六一  一二·四六   据一九五○年
          十二月统计入
          学人数已为七
          一、七五四人
    北京        三三○、八一八   三二、七○四      九·八九 据一九五○年
          十二月统计入
          学人数已为四
          七、○○○人
    旅大        一一八、一六四   四五、六四一    三八·六三
    武汉        二三○、○○○   二二、七一三      九·八八
    西安          六七、七○○     二、○一五      二·九七
    总计    二、一○三、四三八 二一六、九七七    一○·三一
    以上数字说明了职工业余教育在各地区的发展是不平衡的。这主要是由于各地解放有先后，工作基础及条件有好坏。即在同一地区或同一城市中，也因以上原因及领导重视与否和干部主观努力程度，而有发展不平衡现象。如华北区，据一九五○年七月份统计，河北省入学职工人数占全体职工百分之一○·六五，而绥远省则仅占百分之二·○四。又在产业与产业之间，也是发展不平衡的。如东北据一九五○年九月份统计，铁路系统，参加学习人数占全体职工的百分之五十左右，而煤矿系统则不到百分之二十。单就旅大一地来看，识字运动开展已近二年，有的工厂入学人数已占全体职工百分之九十以上（文盲工人全部入学），但有的工厂入学职工还仅仅是百分之三十左右。
    职工的文化教育，在学习组织形式上可分为集中的业余学校与分散的识字班、组（如车间学习）二种。集中的业余学校，又可分为大厂矿企业或机关团体一个单位所举办的，邻近几个厂矿企业或机关团体联合举办的及各级学校或文化馆所附设的几种类型。班别一般分为普通班、中级班和高级班，这三种班级包括由识字到中学毕业程度的不同班次。
    至于职工文化教材，一九四九年以来，各地区如京、津、沪、旅大、沈阳、太原、哈尔滨等大城市、东北大行政区及河南省等地都已编出一套。属于全国方面的，则有工人出版社发行的职工业余教育初、中级教材。以上各区教材，有的是由党委宣传部门或政府文教部门与工会文教部门负责编辑的，有的则是组织一批中、小学教员利用假期编辑的，有的是由已建立的专门编辑机构（如东北）编辑的。在编辑方法上有：（一）自己编写；（二）就报刊上选材料编写；（三）删改精减现有教材；（四）翻印其他地区教材暂供应用。现已编出的教材大多是相当初小水平之初级班使用的（国语、算术），其次为相当高小水平的中级班教材（包括国语、算术、常识），相当中学水平高级班教材，一般都用中学或工农速成中学教材加以精简。北京曾选过活页文选，供高级班国文课用。总之，一九四九年以来虽已有了初级、中级文化教材，初步解决了职工教育的需要，但数量上还不全备，质量上也不够高。
    政治思想教育，各地在解放后就展开了，一年来从没有间断过。一般采取上大课（定期或不定期），讲解时事及当前任务，结合职工思想与生产中的问题进行。教材多取材于报纸或有专人作专题报告，并辅以其他形式的宣传教育活动。在过去政治启蒙教育阶段，各地一般都进行了社会发展规律的讲授，以及工人阶级教育、政治教育、工会组织和国际主义教育。这对于提高职工的政治觉悟，建立新的劳动态度，以及在此基础上而展开文化，技术学习都起了极大的作用。启蒙后的政治思想教育正向着深入与有系统的学习方向发展；而自美帝侵略朝鲜以来，各地普遍开展了抗美援朝的时事教育，通过这一学习，普遍掀起了爱国主义的生产竞赛。北京工人提出“坚持工作，服从组织”，其他地区的职工也纷纷表示，愿以自己全部力量贡献于抗美援朝、保家卫国的斗争。
    技术教育，一年来也有发展。最普遍的是通过“师徒合同”，现场学习等方式，提高操作技术；同时也利用业余技术学校、技术讲座等方式，进行较高一级的技术理论学习。技术教材因各企业性质与工作不同，皆由各企业自行编写。
  二、成绩与收获
    一年来职工业余教育的主要成绩与收获，表现在以下几个方面：
    （一）明确了职工业余教育的方针，建立了统一的领导组织。一九五○年四月，中华全国总工会召开了九大城市职工业余教育座谈会，对若干重大问题都初步的交换了意见。六月一日，政务院发布了“开展职工业余教育的指示”，根据当前情况，明确规定了以文化学习为主，以识字教育为重点的方针。九月，中央教育部、中华全国总工会联合召开第一次全国工农教育会议，更进一步拟定了有关职工业余教育的实施办法，和各级职工业余教育委员会的组织条例；这对今后工作的正确与广泛的开展具有决定性的作用。
    （二）提高了广大职工的政治觉悟和生产积极性。经过学习，职工的政治觉悟已普遍提高。他们一般的了解到“劳动创造世界”的道理，树立了工人是领导阶级、当家作主的思想。而在国际问题上也分清了二大阵营，明确了“一边倒”的意义。在政治觉悟的基础上，建立了新的劳动态度，在恢复与发展生产中间，表现出高度热情与工作的积极性。下面就是许多实例中的几个例子：如旅大金州纺织厂，从一九五○年一月至四月共完成纺纱任务百分之一一七·二○，完成织布任务百分之一一二；在质的方面，一等品占百分之九十七，三等品仅占百分之○·○七；在成本方面也降低了百分之四。又如天津制钢厂的刘小黑，和棉纺五厂的王家宗，不仅是学习模范同时也是生产模范。
    （三）职工获得了初步读写的能力。经过学习，广大职工已开始能使用取得文化科学知识，提高政治认识的文字工具。用工人自己的话说，是“真正睁开了眼睛”。旅大在一九五○年八月识字学习大检查中，全区参加毕业会考的职工共计八千六百八十六人，及格毕业的六千八百九十一人，占参加考试人数百分之七九·五○。其中金州纺织厂从一九四九年三月到一九五○年六月，已有一千零五十人完成了识一千二百字的任务。根据各地材料，一般文盲工人在三四个月期间，都能学会三四百字左右，学习五六个月，差不多都能写便条、看通知、记账，有的并能写出简单的壁报稿。个别的如旅大特等识字模范青年女工刘梅兰，一年内学会两千字，已能写工作报告。
    （四）提高了职工的生产技术水平。文化、政治的学习，为广大职工创造了研究技术，提高技术的条件与热情。经过学习，提高生产技术的实例是不胜枚举的。如天津电车公司业余学校学员从大气压的讲解里懂得了气泵的原理；仁立毛呢厂工人在学完圆周后，按装滑轮皮带时，就能根据滑轮直径计算皮带长短。又如抚顺矿专工人业余学校，学员共二百七十九人，在一年多就创造了四百七十八次生产新纪录；尤其值得特别提出的，是中长铁路培养了田桂英等八名女司机、司炉。这在中国是一件空前的创举，它为新中国妇女参加重工业建设开辟了光辉的道路。
    （五）大量培养了工人干部。配合共产党、青年团的组织教育，从一九四七年至一九四九年年底，只东北区就培养了数万工人干部。如鸡西一个矿区就培养了坑、股长以上和工会委员以上干部一千二百余人；哈尔滨市培养了工会分会主任以上干部及企业管理、政权干部三千八百多人。又如石家庄市的一个区，经过学习，一九五○年内就培养与提拔了三百三十五名干部。旅大制冰厂工人谢世山，由于识了字，能看浅近的技术书籍，技术水平逐步提高，不断提出合理化建议，于一九四九年十月已被提升为分厂长。
    一年来的职工业余教育，成绩与收获是主要的。但也存在过或仍然存在着一些缺点和问题，如有些地区领导上尚不够重视或实施方针还不够明确，政府、工会及各有关部门还不能充分发挥“统一领导、分工合作”的效能，不少厂矿工人还得不到学习时间的保证。教师量少质低，缺乏统一与适当的教材，在经费上还存在困难或多寡不均及缺乏使用的全面计划性等等现象。这些都在一定程度上影响了工作的开展。但在一九五○年九月第一次全国工农教育会议上，这些问题大都达到了认识上的一致，已打开了解决的途径。
  三、对于几个主要问题的体会
    一年来的职工业余教育，在各级领导和干部及广大职工群众的共同努力下，已经创造了许多经验。兹就对几个主要问题的体会简述如下：
        （一）由政治启蒙教育，转为以文化教育为主，并适当地结合政治、
    技术教育，是职工业余教育的一般发展规律。
    解放初期，普遍集中地进行一定时期的政治启蒙教育，是非常必要的。这是由旧社会过渡到新社会，转变受旧社会欺骗蒙蔽的工人基本政治认识的历史任务。但是，当职工已对共产党与国民党反动派、工人阶级与资产阶级、农民阶级与地主阶级、苏联与美帝国主义等重大问题有了基本认识，工会组织已建立，生产的恢复或发展已纳入正轨时，就必须适时地逐步地转为以文化学习为主，适当结合政治、技术教育。如仍停留在政治启蒙教育阶段，职工的学习兴趣就会降低，就将影响职工业余教育的进一步发展。一个工人，如果没有初步读写算能力，要有系统地提高其政治、技术水平是不可能的。而文化教育的内容和教学方法，也必须充分地表达和联系职工的实际生活和当前的政治斗争任务。一九五○年工农教育会议所通过的职工业余教育暂行实施办法，正是总结了这条经验。一般的原则是：在固定的业余时间内学文化，通过生产过程学技术（以操作技术为主），而政治教育则在文化学习时间以外，通过专题报告，讲座、时事学习，各种会议、动员工作、纪念日及文娱活动等进行；已有相当文化程度的职工，可以专门组织较高一级的政治班、技术班，有系统地进行政治、技术学习。
        （二）引起厂矿行政领导的重视，健全领导机构，作好动员工作，是
    开展职工业余教育的三个重要环节。
    厂矿行政领导重视与否，是职工业余教育工作能否顺利开展的关键。首先须努力使厂矿行政领导对职工业余教育的重大政治意义有足够认识，充分了解加强工人教育，提高工人文化是巩固与发展人民民主专政、建立强大国防力量和经济力量的必要条件；也是广大职工群众的切身要求。只有重视与多方帮助工人的学习，才能启发工人生产的积极性，才有可能改进技术提高劳动生产率，才更有利于生产。例如旅大金州纺织厂、大连火柴厂等单位，由于领导上重视，在学习时间，设备等方面给以保证和帮助，识字运动已获得很大的成绩（计划二年内即可消灭全厂文盲），而生产任务也能顺利完成。
    健全领导机构，必须贯彻“政府领导、依靠工会，联合有关方面”的原则。成立真正名符其实的职工业余教育委员会，切实实现“统一领导、分工合作”，克服本位主义，纠正包办作风或互相推卸责任的偏向。职工教育是一种业余性质的群众学习运动，如果党政工团不认真地负起责任、在统一计划下分工负责、齐一步调并保持密切联系，而只是像座谈会或联席会似的有工夫就到，不高兴就不出席，事先不准备、不考虑，临时发表些意见，就决不可能做好这一工作。一年来的事实证明：凡是正确执行与贯彻了这个方针的地区，工作就做得好；凡是执行不认真或发生偏差的地区，工作上就受到一定程度的损失。
    由于职工业余教育是一种群众性的学习运动，因此必须做好动员工作，首先把职工发动起来，而后加以艰苦细密的组织工作，并注意不断地进行动员，以巩固与发展其学习情绪。工人学文化是工人文化上的翻身，是工人自己的事情，必须依靠工人自己去做。如果工人自己还没有体会到学文化的重要，缺乏学习的自觉性与积极性，就决不能做好，更不能坚持下去。一年来各地通过文化诉苦，唤起工人学习觉悟，运用戏剧、歌咏、壁报等鼓励学习，由群众推选学习模范等，都是鼓舞工人学习情绪的成功方式。他如工人自订学习公约，研讨学习方法，自行聘请教师，修理校舍等，都是进行深入动员的良好结果。相反的如领导上动机虽好，但却不耐心地进行深入动员工作，方式简单，自上而下的命令，工作一时也可以勉强搞起来，但决难巩固与持久。
        （三）学习的组织形式必须适应群众的生产与生活条件，灵活应用，
    同时又必须有一定的教学计划与工作制度。
    各地经验证明：学习组织形式的确定，必须根据两条原则，第一是学习组织形式要适应工人的生产与生活条件；第二不论何种形式都要有一定的教学计划与工作制度。这是既照顾到工人的需要与可能，又要照顾到教学的实效。集中形式一般的教学效果好，但有局限性（教员、校舍、设备等条件的限制）；因此虽是主要的形式，但不应是唯一的形式。分散形式，可充分利用一切条件、因人、因时、因地制宜，使工人感觉简便易行；此点目前一般的认识不足，有忽视现象，应引起注意。
    但分散形式的学习也必须有教学计划，有必要的工作制度；也就是说必须有统一的领导，有督促、有检查、有帮助、有指示、有总结。正因为分散、所以更须抓紧。否则就易自流、不能保持学习的计划性与经常性；因此就会减少学习效果，降低学习情绪，甚至丧失学习信心。最好能定期集中进行动员与传达教学计划，检查工作，总结经验，举行测验、表扬成绩，介绍好的典型或学习经验等。经验证明，这对学习情绪的鼓舞，学习效果的提高，是有极大作用的。
        （四）在厂矿职员中动员教师，是解决职工教育师资问题的基本方向。
    一年来的经验证明：在厂矿职员中动员教师是解决师资问题的好办法；同时如果没有一定数量质量的专职教员，也难于把工人业余学校办好。旅大地区在开展识字运动初期，发动工人举行文化诉苦大会，邀请职员参加，不仅激发了工人的学习觉悟与热情，也使职员们深受感动，认为帮助工人识字学文化，是自己义不容辞的光荣责任。当时有许多职员纷纷报名，以后由领导上正式聘请。这种教师的特点，是熟习工人的生活、思想和生产情况；自觉、积极、热心。职员兼任教师使工人与职员在工作关系之外又出现了一种师生关系，可以密切彼此联系，加强友爱团结。同时职员一方面教育工人，一方面也就自然地向工人学习其优秀品质与作风，可以推动自己进步。教学相长，这对职员也有很大好处。
    这些义务教师的主要缺点是：教学经验差，一般的文化水平也不高。因此，如何加以培养和提高是个重要问题。各地在这方面已有不少经验：如（一）举办脱离生产的或业余的师资训练班，针对不同情况与要求，分别对象给以业务上，政治上或文化上的短期教育。（二）实行集体备课制度，定期举行教学研究会，总结教学经验。（三）举行师生座谈会，吸收工人意见，交换教学心得。（四）订立表扬奖励制度，对教学热心并有成绩者给予名誉的或物质的奖励，或给以一定的津贴。
    此外，使少数专任教师参与工会工作，熟习工人的生活及生产情况，对于提高专职教师，加强他们的教学业务也有很大作用。
        （五）保证学习时间，适当解决经费问题是开展职工业余教育的重要
    条件。
    工人学习时间常常不能得到充分保证，是开展职工业余教育首先碰到的一个最重要的实际问题。这个问题关联着领导思想、生产任务、劳动组织、和党政工团各方面的工作，是各种矛盾集中的表现，相当复杂。但事实证明：这个问题的适当解决，是开展与巩固职工学习的重要条件，否则一切将会落空。例如平原省有些厂矿，工人生产时间曾经甚至达到十二小时，严重影响甚至根本妨碍了职工业余教育的举办。又如天津某棉纺厂，去年三月曾每日加点一小时（十一小时），工人因疲劳过度，无暇学习，影响业余学校几至垮台。各地经验证明：工时愈长，生产率也愈相对降低，成本也愈增加。此外，由于党政工团各系统对于布置工作缺乏全面的通盘计划，或会议活动过多，或劳动组织复杂（如经常倒班），以致学习时间受到极大影响。这些，各系统领导上，都应充分考虑，全面研究，本着不影响生产和职工健康的原则，适应或调整劳动组织，合理的支配业余时间，精简会议活动，规定统一的学习日等，以求切实解决，否则职工学习是不会巩固的。
    目前经费的主要问题是“多寡不均”及缺乏使用的全面的计划性。只要行政方面或资方能按工会法的规定拨交工会文教费，工会组织又能认真按照中华全国总工会所公布的办法使用，各市级职工业余教育委员会能以市为单位切实地全面考虑通盘计划，作适当调剂，政府又予以一定的必要的补助，则职工业余教育的经费问题一般的是可以解决的。
        （六）职工的业余文化教育应有统一的（不是按企业行业的）、以语
    文教学规律为主的、并注意成人特点的教材。
    一年来经验证明：不同企业行业的工人只在初识字时，课文须密切联系其生产及其日常生活中的常用字，以帮助记忆并便于应用；但各企业行业之专门常用字有限，而工人文化学习的目的是掌握文字工具，并有系统地提高文化及知识水平，不能也不应该陷于狭隘的企业或行业本身日常应用的范围内。故职工的文化程度愈提高，各企业行业在教材上的区别愈小，这就是说明职工的文化教育教材基本上应是统一的。至各企业行业特殊需要可另编补充教材。那种主张工人学习必须与实际结合，能“即学即用”，才能巩固其学习情绪；各企业行业生产情况不同，因此须各编教材，以便于结合实际。这种理由是不够全面与充分的。
    一年来的经验也证明：识字文化教材应以语文教学规律为主。对“文化结合政治”的正确了解应该是在课文中严格要求立场、观点的正确，在课文中充分渗透着政治思想内容，不应该要求文化教材中包括着系统的政治知识。因为文化学习与政治学习是工具与目的的关系，只有打下文化基础才能在政治上有系统地提高，所以提高文化本身就是一项政治任务。编辑识字文化教材，如不能以语文为主而单纯地将政治口号名词，生硬堆砌，认为语文中多讲政治，就是文化与政治结合，以致把文化课本变成政治课本，上文化课形成上政治课，实是一种偏向。
    经验也证明：职工识字学文化的教材，必须注意成人的特点。在教材中，一方面须注意掌握深入浅出的原则，逐步启发其对知识之兴趣，对成人已熟知的事务不必反复讲述；另方面须注意照顾其记忆差。如识字教材必须注意各课生字数目的平均及单字重复出现的次数；又如算术整数四则部分，因成人已有心算能力，说明应该简要，例题中的文字切忌多。
