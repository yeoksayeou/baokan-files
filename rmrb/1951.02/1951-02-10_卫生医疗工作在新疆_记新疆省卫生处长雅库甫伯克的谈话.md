Healthcare Work in Xinjiang
    —An Interview with Yaqup Bek, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Health Department
    Ye Qun

    I. The Legacy of Disease and Disaster from the Kuomintang Reactionaries

    Xinjiang Province is one of the regions in our country where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. Before liberation, as a result of the Kuomintang reactionary government's brutal plunder, healthcare was extremely backward, and various diseases spread, severely destroying the health of our fraternal nationalities. Taking venereal disease and smallpox as examples, according to the investigation by the Central Delegation last autumn: venereal disease patients accounted for about 50 percent of the Mongol population, and some materials even reached more than 90 percent. For example, in a certain representative conference, 32 out of 33 representatives had venereal disease. Among women suffering from venereal disease, the number of infertile women was generally higher than the number of fertile women, and the death rate of children after birth was higher than the survival rate. Therefore, in areas where venereal disease was more serious, the population decreased year by year. For example, in Gongha County in the Ili region, there were 10,000 households more than 20 years ago, but only 3,000 households were left at the time of liberation. The main reason was that the spread of venereal disease affected the reproduction of the population. The harm of smallpox was also very serious in the local area. After spring every year, the cries of mothers whose children had died could be heard everywhere in the smallpox prevalent areas. It is estimated that the mortality rate of children under the age of three in Xinjiang Province reached 70 percent, most of whom died of smallpox. In addition, measles, acute gastroenteritis, neonatal tetanus, malaria, thyroid disease, and infectious diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery were also very common. Due to economic and cultural backwardness, the vast majority of people could not get reasonable treatment after getting sick. Women generally used old methods of delivery during childbirth. In pastoral areas, everyone even thought that childbirth was a "dirty" thing. When a woman was about to give birth, she had to go to the wild, and she could not go home until she cleaned up after giving birth. Due to unsanitary delivery, many babies contracted neonatal tetanus and died young.

    These disease disasters are inseparable from the policies of oppression and plunder of ethnic minorities by the reactionary ruling class since the Qing Dynasty. Not to mention the distant past, since Sheng Shicai openly betrayed the people of Xinjiang in 1942 and the Kuomintang reactionary government re-entered Xinjiang, not only did they fail to take any effective prevention and control measures against the people's diseases, but they also destroyed the healthcare that the local people had begun to create with the help of the Soviet Union. For example, in a relatively well-equipped hospital in Kashgar, after the "院长" (dean) Huang Jianong sent by the Kuomintang reactionary government took office, the equipment in the hospital became less and less under his open corruption and secret theft. When the "院长" had almost stolen all the hospital's assets, he "left without saying goodbye."

    II. People's Health Care After Liberation

    In September 1949, with the victorious situation at home and abroad and the ardent expectations of the people across the country, the entire territory of Xinjiang Province was peacefully liberated. In December, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government was established, and the Provincial Health Department was also established. At that time, the medical and health situation in the province was as follows: the organization of medical institutions in the Ili, Ta, and A three districts (after the liberation of the whole province, the people of the three districts automatically canceled the name of "autonomy"), which began to get rid of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in 1944 and officially declared autonomy in 1947, was relatively sound. Since 1945, a lot of work has been done in preventing and treating epidemic diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria, and in training intermediate medical and nursing cadres and other medical education work. The hospitals in other districts and their subordinate hospitals, which had just been liberated from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, generally had problems such as unsound organization, simple equipment, and lack of formal medical rules. The service concept of the staff was also extremely unclear. In response to this situation, the Provincial Health Department decided to carry out treatment and epidemic prevention work in the first half of 1950, while focusing on reorganizing the organization and initially replenishing equipment. Hygiene departments were successively established in various districts to establish regular leadership relationships and various systems between higher and lower levels. The government allocated 3.9 million catties of millet in difficult economic circumstances as funding for healthcare. Three hundred beds were equipped successively, and an X-ray room was established. In order to take care of the local poor people, the central government allocated 1.5 million catties of millet to Xinjiang as a special fund for free medical care for ethnic minorities at the beginning of winter. From December, it was stipulated that 245 out of more than 700 beds in the province were free beds. For counties that had not established medical institutions, the nearby district hospitals were designated to take care of medical services. Political studies were universally carried out in institutions at all levels to establish the idea of serving the people. After such a series of measures, the political awareness of cadres was generally improved, and the past chaotic phenomena were gradually cleared up in terms of organization, and work began to get on the right track.

    Due to the gradual improvement of institutions, business has also been carried out. According to statistics from January to September last year: more than 334,500 people were treated as outpatients, and more than 13,600 were hospitalized. In terms of epidemic prevention, when smallpox occurred in the north and south of Xinjiang in early 1950, the Provincial Health Department immediately sent cadres to the affected areas with vaccines to mobilize various forces to establish epidemic prevention committees and organize epidemic prevention teams and epidemic prevention groups, and cooperated with the local garrison troops to carry out vaccination work. A total of one million people were vaccinated before and after, of which residents accounted for more than 85 percent, effectively curbing the spread of smallpox. Such a large-scale vaccination campaign was the first in the history of Xinjiang Province. In other areas, treatment or prevention was also carried out in a timely manner for epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, typhoid fever, cholera, etc. that had occurred or might occur. This is one of the factors that enabled the masses in the province to increase production after liberation.

    In the entire process of treatment and epidemic prevention, in order to improve the masses' medical and health knowledge at the same time, various places widely conducted publicity and education on medical and health knowledge to the masses through broadcasting, lectures, and poster propaganda at some public gatherings. In the Uighur and Kazakh versions of the Xinjiang Daily, the prevention and treatment methods of some common infectious diseases were regularly introduced.

    In mid-September last year, the Central Delegation headed by Shen Junru arrived in Xinjiang with the Central People's Government's care for the fraternal nationalities. Some of the delegation members who did healthcare work accompanied the sub-delegations and successively visited hospitals in eight districts including Yanqi, Aksu, Kashgar, Shache, Hotan, and Ili, and four county health centers, held three symposiums, and learned about and studied the local health situation, providing a lot of valuable information for carrying out healthcare in the future. The delegation brought some medicines and equipment to the fraternal nationalities, including 3 million units of oil-based penicillin, sulfa tablets, microscopes, rubber gloves, and medical books. More than 2,700 bottles of oil-based penicillin are being injected into pregnant women with venereal disease with emphasis.

    III. The Plan for 1951

    Xinjiang Province is the largest province in our country, equivalent to the total area of 16 Zhejiang provinces, but the foundation of healthcare here is very weak. At present, there are 12 hospitals in the province, with 735 beds, distributed in Dihua and the locations of the other nine special districts; there are five pharmacies and 51 health centers (stations), with a total of 462 medical and nursing cadres, of which only 15 are senior doctors. After liberation, these institutions have been partially improved and adjusted, but compared with the needs, they are still far from enough, and continuous efforts are needed to gradually improve them. This year, the central government allocated 9.7 million catties of millet for healthcare (including free medical care), which will greatly help the development and promotion of epidemic prevention, medical treatment, and medical education this year.

    According to the principle of "prevention first, serving workers and peasants, uniting Chinese and Western medicine" determined at the National Health Conference last year and the current conditions in Xinjiang Province, the work to be carried out in 1951 is as follows: 1. Vigorously carry out epidemic prevention work. First of all, for seasonal diseases that are fast-spreading and harmful, such as smallpox, the province plans to vaccinate one million people with cowpox this year. As for various social chronic infectious diseases and endemic diseases, these are gradually formed under many factors, and it is impossible to eradicate them in a short period of time. Therefore, we must first conduct practical investigations, study the source of the disease, and implement effective prevention and treatment within the possible scope. 2. Promote healthcare work and establish healthcare institutions at the district and county levels. The focus of healthcare work is maternal and child healthcare, because the health of the mother will directly affect the growth of the next generation. In order to gradually carry out this work, various healthcare units will reduce or exempt delivery fees according to the actual situation, train midwives, transform old midwives, and cooperate with medical institutions to provide free treatment for pregnant women with venereal disease. In addition, this year we plan to formulate hygiene regulations for public places, factories, cities, schools, and other places to initially improve environmental hygiene. 3. Strengthen medical and health education, and continue to train intermediate medical and nursing cadres. Xinjiang Province now has one intermediate medical school and one medical training class, with a total of 332 students. In addition to continuing to strengthen leadership and assistance to these two schools this year, we plan to train 40 nurses, 20 laboratory technicians, and 40 midwives, with a duration of six months to eight months. For general Chinese medicine practitioners who have medical knowledge and prestige among the masses, we will help them improve their professional level and political awareness, and unite them to participate in some medical and epidemic prevention work.

    In addition, in order to make scientific healthcare accepted by the masses, medical and nursing departments must cooperate with local governments, consult with relevant authorities, and use various popular and easy-to-understand materials to carry out extensive publicity and education to enlighten the masses' understanding of scientific medical knowledge. 4. Further consolidate existing institutions. According to the current conditions, we will first improve the equipment of hospitals in Ili, Kashgar, and Dihua, so that they can both take care of necessary treatment and flexibly guide the business of county health centers and help solve difficulties in treatment technology. For some counties that are far away from the special area and have no medical institutions, in addition to focusing on establishing county health centers and universally establishing county health stations this year, we also plan to take mobile medical treatment and mobilize local medical personnel to solve some of the difficulties in those areas.

　　卫生医疗工作在新疆       
    ——记新疆省卫生处长雅库甫伯克的谈话
    叶群
            一、国民党反动派遗留下来的疾病灾难
    新疆省是我国少数民族聚居地区之一。解放前，由于国民党反动政府残酷掠夺的结果，卫生事业极落后，各种疾病蔓延，严重地摧毁着兄弟民族的健康。以性病、天花来说，据去秋中央访问团的调查：性病患者在蒙古族同胞中占人口的百分之五十左右，个别材料竟达百分之九十以上。如某次代表会，三十三个代表中，有三十二个有性病。在患性病的妇女中，一般不生育的比能生育的多，出生后的孩子死的又比活的多，因此在性病较严重的地区，人口逐年减少。如伊犁专区的巩哈县，二十多年前有一万户人家，到解放时，只剩了三千户。其主要原因是性病蔓延影响人口繁殖的结果。天花的危害在当地亦很严重，每年春天一过，天花盛行区便到处出现死了孩子的母亲的哭声。据估计：在新疆省三岁以下孩子的死亡率达百分之七十，其中多数死于天花。此外，麻疹或急性肠胃病、脐风、疟疾、甲状腺病以及伤寒、痢疾等传染病亦很普遍。由于经济、文化落后，绝大多数人在病后都不能得到合理的治疗。妇女临产普遍袭用老法接生。在游牧区，大家更认为生产是“肮脏”的事，产妇临产时，必须到野外去，产后收拾好才能回家。由于接产不消毒，不少婴孩染上脐风而夭折。
    这些疾病灾难，和清季以来反动统治阶级对少数民族压迫、掠夺的政策是分不开的。远的不说，从一九四二年盛世才公开背叛新疆人民，国民党反动政府再度入新以后，他们非但没有对人民的疾病作任何有效的防治措施，反将当地人民在苏联帮助下开始创立起来的卫生事业也破坏了。例如在喀什一个设备比较好的医院，自国民党反动政府派去的“院长”黄家农到任后，在他公开贪污和秘密盗窃下，医院里的设备一天少一天，到医院资产给他盗窃得差不多时，这位“院长”便“不辞而别了。”
            二、解放后的人民保健事业
    一九四九年九月，在国内外胜利形势和全国人民的热切期望下，新疆省全境和平解放。十二月间，新疆省人民政府成立，省卫生处也建立了。当时全省的医药卫生情况是这样：一九四四年开始摆脱国民党反动统治，在一九四七年正式宣布自治的伊、塔、阿三区（全省解放后，三区人民自动将“自治”名字取消），医疗机构的组织较健全。一九四五年以来，先后做了许多预防天花、班疹伤寒、白喉等流行病的工作和培养中级医护干部等医学教育工作。其他几个刚从国民党反动政府统治下解放的专区及所属的医院，则普遍存在组织不健全、设备简陋、没有正规的医疗规则等现象，工作人员的服务观念亦极不明确。针对这一情况，省卫生处决定在一九五○年上半年一边进行治疗防疫工作，同时把工作重点放在整顿组织、初步充实设备等方面。各专区先后成立卫生科，建立上下级经常的领导关系和各种制度。政府在困难的经济情况下，拨出了小米三百九十万斤充作卫生事业经费，先后装备了三百张病床，成立了一个爱克司光室，为照顾当地的贫困群众，冬初中央拨发少数民族医疗免费专款一百五十万斤小米给新疆，从十二月份开始规定在全省七百多张病床中，有二百四十五张是免费病床。对没有设立医疗机构的县，则指定靠近的专区医院兼管医疗业务，在各级机构中，都普遍开展了政治学习，确立为人民服务的思想。经过这样一连串的措施后，干部政治觉悟普遍提高，在组织方面也逐渐地扫清了过去的混乱现象，工作开始步上正轨。
    由于机构逐步健全，业务方面也有了开展。据去年一月到九月的统计：门诊治疗三十三万四千五百多人，住院的一万三千六百多人。在防疫方面，一九五○年初南北疆发生天花时，省卫生处即派干部携带痘苗往发病地区发动各种力量成立防疫委员会，组织防疫队、防疫组，配合当地驻军，开展种痘工作，前后共接种一百万人，其中居民占百分之八十五以上，有效地制止了天花的蔓延。像这样大规模的种痘运动，在新疆省历史上还是第一次。在其他地区，对已发生或可能发生的流行性脑脊髓膜炎、白喉、伤寒、霍乱等也及时地进行了治疗或预防。这是该省在解放后群众所以能增产的因素之一。
    在整个治疗防疫工作过程中，为了能同时提高群众的医药卫生常识，各地在某些公共集会通过广播、演讲、挂图宣传等方式，对群众广泛地进行医药卫生常识的宣传教育工作，在维文版和哈文版的新疆日报上，定期介绍某些较普遍的传染病的预防和治疗方法。
    去年九月中旬，以沈钧儒为首的中央访问团带着中央人民政府对兄弟民族的关怀到达了新疆。其中部分做卫生工作的团员随同分团，先后访问了焉耆、阿克苏、喀什、莎车、和阗、伊犁等八个专区的医院和四个县卫生院，举行了三次座谈会，了解和研究当地的卫生情况，对开展今后卫生事业提供了很多宝贵资料。访问团带去一部分送给兄弟民族的药品器材，包括三百万单位的油质盘尼西林、磺胺片以及显微镜、橡皮手套、医学书籍等。其中二千七百多瓶油质盘尼西林正在有重点地给有性病的孕妇注射。
            三、一九五一年的计划
    新疆省是我国最大的一个省，相当于十六个浙江省面积的总和，但这里的卫生工作基础很薄弱。目前全省有十二个医院，七百三十五张病床，分布在迪化及其他九个专署所在地；有五个药房、五十一个卫生院（所），医护干部共四百六十二人，其中高级医师仅十五人。解放后，这些机构虽已得到部分改进和调整，但跟需要比较起来，还差得很远，需要不断努力来逐步改善。一九五一年中央拨发卫生事业费九百七十万斤小米（包括医疗免费在内），这对今年防疫医疗、医学教育的发展与推动，将有很大的帮助。
    根据去年全国卫生会议所决定的“预防为主、面向工农、团结中西医”的方针及新疆省目前的条件，一九五一年将进行的工作如下：一、大力开展防疫工作，首先是对传染快、危害性大的时令病如天花等，今年全省准备接种牛痘一百万人。至于各种社会性慢性传染病与地方病，这是在许多因素下逐渐形成的，在短时期内杜绝还不可能。因此，在目前首先进行实际调查，研究病源，在可能范围内施行有效防治。二、推进卫生保健工作，建立专区和县一级的保健机构。保健工作的重点是妇幼保健，因为母亲的健康与否将直接影响下一代的成长。为了使这一工作能逐步开展，各保健单位将按实际情形减费或免费接产，训练助产士，改造旧产婆，并配合医疗机构免费治疗孕妇的性病。此外，今年准备拟定公共场所、工厂、城市、学校等地方卫生条例，初步改善环境卫生。三、加强医药卫生的教育工作，继续培养中级医护干部。新疆省现在有一个中级医药学校和一个医学专修班，共有学生三百三十二人。今年除继续加强对这两个学校的领导与帮助外，准备再训练护士四十名、化验员二十名、助产士四十名，时间是六个月到八个月。对于一般具有医学常识、在群众中有威信的中医，则帮助他们提高业务水平和政治认识，团结他们参加若干医疗及防疫工作。
    此外，为使科学的卫生工作能为群众所接受，医护部门必须配合当地地方政府，商同有关机关，利用各种通俗易懂的材料进行广泛的宣传教育，启发群众对科学的医学常识的认识。四、进一步整顿现有机构。根据目前条件，先将伊犁、喀什、迪化等地的医院设备改进一步，使能既可照顾必要的治疗，又能机动地指导各县卫生院的业务，帮助解决治疗技术上的困难。某些离专区较远而又无医疗机构的县，今年除有重点的建立县卫生院、普设县卫生所外，并准备同时采取巡回医疗和发动地方医务人员来解决那些地区的部分困难。
