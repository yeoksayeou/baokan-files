　　Strengthen the Publicity of Mountain Protection and Afforestation
    Editor:
    On February 7th, when I passed through Changping County (Hebei Province) on my way back to Taolin Village, I saw a fire on the mountain north of Taolin Village. The "fire dragon" was six or seven li long. The wild grass and trees on the mountain were burning and crackling, which was really heartbreaking. However, such a big fire was not being put out by anyone. I asked the local farmers why they didn't go to fight the fire. One of them replied, "This kind of thing has happened often in the past, and no one has ever gone to put it out." This shows that the People's Government's policy of protecting mountains and forests is not being publicized enough in the Taolin Village area of Changping. This is a loss and should be brought to the attention of the local People's Government.

### 加强护山育林的宣传

　　加强护山育林的宣传
    编辑同志：
    二月七日我路过昌平县（河北省）城回桃林村的时候，看见桃林村北面的山上起了火，“火龙”有六、七里路长，山上的野草和树木烧得格格作响，实是令人痛心。但是，这样大的火灾竟没有人去施救，我问当地农民为什么不去救火，其中一位回答我说：“这样的事过去常有，谁也没有去救过。”由此可见人民政府护山育林的政策在昌平桃林村一带是宣传得不够的。这是一项损失，应该引起当地人民政府的注意。
