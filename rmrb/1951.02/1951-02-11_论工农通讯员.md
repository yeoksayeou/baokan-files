　　On Worker and Peasant Correspondents
　　By Kalinin

　　I. Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Worker Correspondents of the *Gudok* Newspaper (Excerpts)

　　Approaching the Life Habits of Workers

　　I would like to talk about the tasks that worker correspondents and newspaper leaders should undertake at present. Everything here has a fashion. The fashion here is to describe the bad aspects of the New Economic Policy, the evils of speculators during the NEP period, etc.

　　I think the time has come for newspapers to also take on the task of fully serving the lives and needs of workers. If it's a transportation newspaper, it should not only report on the technical demands of transport workers, but also on their lives at home, their demands on schools, department stores, certain shops, cooperatives, and all public institutions that workers use. It is precisely the reporting on the demands and needs of workers that is comparatively poor.

　　For example, if I walk into a shop or department store, I should be well received, my purchases should be properly wrapped, I should be treated attentively, and I shouldn't have to wait too long. If this is not the case, if the demands of workers are not paid attention to, then clearly, the interests of workers are being harmed, and therefore the press should report on these things.

　　Should Not Be Written Like This

　　Not long ago, *Pravda* published an article by Larin on the issue of raising rents, at a time when there were plans to increase rents.

　　Larin looked at this issue very simply: rents should be increased for speculators during the NEP period, but reduced for workers.

　　I read Larin's article and found nothing new in it. I probably could have read such an article during the war, in our underground leaflets; I could probably have found many paragraphs there that could replace Larin's article.

　　Now, such articles can be seen in all languages—French, English, almost everywhere—because there is nothing concrete in them, because they only contain the naked principle that workers should pay less rent. But if Larin had truly studied the issue of housing, then he should have proposed: how to practically guarantee housing for workers, and what material conditions the state should have for this.

　　Therefore, I think many young worker correspondents easily fall into this rut. Any correspondent is like this. He can find many shortcomings in the work of transportation staff, from the head of the railway to the ordinary worker. But does this mean it can be written in the same way as Comrade Larin wrote? I don't think so, because that is just picking on the easy targets.

　　What Should a Worker Correspondent Be Like?

　　You also feel that there are two kinds of people in general life, one who strives to find the truth in every issue and then fights for this truth. Of course, sometimes he fights not for the truth but for a mistake, but in fact he is looking for the truth, and often suffers blows for going to the truth despite difficulties.

　　The other kind of person goes with the flow, just shouting out what everyone is dissatisfied with as early as possible. Here you are not in danger, because everyone is shouting about the same thing. I would like worker correspondents to become the first type of person, each of whom has his own truth and also defends it. It is possible that this truth is sometimes contrary to the general trend. The more independently a worker correspondent studies each issue he raises in the press, the more valuable he is as a worker correspondent, and the more valuable he is as a person, in my opinion. But, undoubtedly, this is also associated with unpleasant things in life—that is the first point; the second—is associated with the worker correspondent independently and carefully studying each issue. I think that this road, no matter how difficult it is, is still the best road. When such a correspondent wants to write about the topic discussed by Comrade Larin, he should ask himself this question: what material conditions does the state need to have in order to guarantee housing for workers? The correspondent should first know that our housing fund is being reduced on a large scale, and the living space is decreasing day by day. The correspondent should study what are the main and fundamental reasons for reducing the housing fund, and what funds are used to make this housing fund. When looking at this issue in this way, then it is found that protecting workers at present does not lie in saying some general empty words, but in carefully weighing what to use to help this demand...

　　II. On What to Write and How to Write

　　In the previous issues of the *Peasant Newspaper*, I answered many letters from peasants that had common significance. My answer brought in a large number of letters again.

　　On the one hand, this should be gratifying, because it marks that the countryside is living an active political life, that peasants pay attention to the *Peasant Newspaper*, and not only to its articles, but also fully participate in the construction of the Soviet state through the newspaper themselves, striving to play a role in the shortcomings of the local government. This trend should be helped unconditionally, and it should be helped to strengthen the ties, strengthen the relationship between the newspaper and its colleagues and the masses of peasant readers, because it is not only beneficial to the peasants, but also beneficial to the newspaper colleagues who directly understand the needs of the peasants through the *Peasant Newspaper*. The countryside will be closer and dearer to them, and the process of changes in life habits that are happening in the countryside will also be clearer.

　　On the other hand, the source of letters is so large, and the strength of individual people is so weak, that it is impossible not to say to answer, but even to read them. Of course, you can let experienced people who can choose worthy letters to read these letters first. I have tried this in this regard, but the result cannot yet be estimated for this experience. But in any case—the classification of letters is one of the most difficult tasks of the service agency.

　　The best way—is to read directly; but, as I said, what happened to me in this regard is the same as what happened to the watermill in early spring: the water flow flooded the entire watermill, the water was higher than the dam, such a large amount of water not only slid over the millstone, but also completely stopped the work of the watermill. These reasons make me pay attention to the seriousness of the so-called communication work of the letter-writing correspondents, what is reported in the newspaper about what is being done in the countryside, and what is being done in the location of the letter-writers.

　　The letter written to the newspaper, although it is written with my name, is no longer a private letter, a private complaint, but a document: its author wants to use his letter as a political action, to draw social attention to the bad things he knows, to expose the roots of the bad things, and to often provide appropriate methods for treating the bad things.

　　There is no question that you cannot only write about the bad phenomena in life. Only writing about bad phenomena—is to point out one aspect of life, or even one side of a three-dimensional triangle, but one aspect cannot draw the concept of the whole thing. Only after understanding the whole picture can you get a complete concept.

　　But just as the letters sent to me make me feel so difficult to handle, so too is it difficult for correspondents to report on local life fully and comprehensively, because he cannot become an expert in various events.

　　Most correspondents delimit for themselves a certain range of issues that they can report on. It should be said directly that letters written by people who are familiar with their own affairs are rarely not used; if they are not directly published, then their ideas, and sometimes even their forms, will be quoted by literary people in their own works and by speakers in their speeches.

　　Therefore, if the letter writer wants (and what writer can not think like this) that his letter will not be rejected and thrown into the editorial department's wastepaper basket, which is characterized by being able to accommodate a large amount of paper, he must know well what he is going to write about. You should know that the connection between the editorial department and its readers is insufficient, for example, the connection between a professor and his audience—the newspaper can be said to be a large parliament or a meeting that is held regularly, and the people who participate in this meeting are learning for themselves and also teaching others to learn. The questions raised by the letter-writing correspondent are not like those raised by a student to his teacher, but sometimes the author of the letter uses his question to make his reader—the editorial department—consider it.

　　The reason I say these things is that you should write about things that have serious reasons to promote writing, and before writing, you must think about it yourself, and it is best to discuss it with others: whether this issue is worth discussing with people who are too busy to deal with it. When it is decided or has already been decided that you must write, you should write well, at least try to write better. It is best to copy it several times, delete the superfluous words, write clearly what is unclear, and try to correct all grammatical errors in the letter so that it is clear and as beautiful as possible.

　　Regarding this point, I have heard thousands of objections: we are not worth copying the letters several times! It is not our fault that we write badly—what beauty is needed here? It is good even if we can write our own thoughts in crooked handwriting. Why must we write well, just because we write badly: if everyone wrote well, then I wouldn't have to say to write well. If someone admits that his letter has great significance, that he wants to use this letter to do a great social work, then he will not be stingy with the time to copy it, nor will he be stingy with the time to have preliminary discussions with others.

　　Then, we have full confidence that this letter will not be discarded, and taking a step back, this letter will leave an impression in the correspondent's mind.

　　论工农通讯员
　　加里宁
    一、在《汽笛报》第一次全苏工人通讯员代表大会上的讲话（摘要）
    接近工人的生活习惯
    我想谈一谈目前工人通讯员和报纸领导者应当担负那些任务。在我们这里一切都有一种时尚。在我们这里的时尚——就是描写新经济政策的坏的一方面，新经济政策时期投机商人的坏处等。
    我觉得现在已到了报纸应该也把充分服务于工人的生活和要求的任务担负起来的时候了。如果这是一个运输报纸，那么它不仅应当报道运输工人对技术的要求，而且也应报道他们在家庭中的生活，他们对学校、大商店、某种店铺、合作社和一切有工人的公共机关的要求。恰恰是对工人的要求和需要的报道比较差一些。
    比如说，如果我走进了某一个店铺或大商店里，那么我就应当好好地受到招待，替我包好我们买的东西，要注意地对待我，不要使我等得太久。如果不是这样，如果对工人的要求不加注意，那么很明显的，工人的利益就被损害了，因此报刊应当报道这些事情。
    不应当这样写
    不久以前在《真理报》上发表了拉林关于提高房租问题的一篇文章，当时正打算要增加房租。
    拉林把这个问题看得很简单：新经济政策时期对投机商人应当提高房租，不过对工人应当减轻。
    我读了拉林的文章，没有发现一点新的东西。这种文章，大概在战前，在我们的地下传单上，我还能够把它读下去；大概在那里还能找到可以代替拉林这篇文章的许多段落。
    现在，在一切语言上——法文、英文，几乎到处都能看到这种文章，因为其中一点具体的东西也没有，因为其中只有工人应当少付房租的赤裸裸的原则。但是拉林如果真正地研究了关于住宅的问题，那么他应当提出：如何不是在口头上而是在实际上保证工人的住宅，国家为此应当具有什么样的物质条件。
    因此，我觉得许多年轻的工人通讯员很容易落入这个窠臼。任何通讯员都是如此。他能够在运输工作人员的工作中找出许多缺点，从铁路首长起到普通工人为止。但是这是不是说可以这样写，如同拉林同志所写的一样呢？我以为不然，因为这只是捡便宜。
    工人通讯员应当是怎样的？
    你们也感到一般生活中有两种人，一种人在每一个问题上都努力于寻找真理，并且以后也为这一真理而斗争。当然，有时他不是为真理而是为错误而斗争，但是事实上他是在找寻真理，并且为了不顾困难走向真理而常常遭到打击。
    另一种人是顺着潮流走的，只是把为大家所不满的事情及早地喊叫了出来。这里你是没有危险的，因为所有的人都在喊叫这一件事。我愿工人通讯员都成为第一类人，其中每一个人都有自己的真理，并且还要保卫它。可能这个真理有时候是与总潮流相反对的。工人通讯员越能独立地研究他在报刊上提出的每一个问题，照我看来，他作为工人通讯员也越有价值，作为一个人也越有价值。但是，无疑地，这也是与生活不愉快相关联着的——这是第一点；第二——是与工人通讯员独立地仔细地研究每一个问题相关联的。我觉得，这条道路，不论它如何的困难，它仍然是一条最好的道路。这种通讯员想写拉林同志所论述的题目的时候，应当向自己提出这样问题：国家要保证工人的住宅需要具有怎样的物质条件呢？通讯员应当首先知道，我们的住宅基金大规模地缩减，住宅面积日益减小。通讯员应当研究什么是缩减住宅基金的主要的、基本的原因，用什么资金来作这个住宅基金。当这样来看这一问题的时候，那么发现，目前保护工人不在于说一些一般的空话，而在于好好地衡量一下用什么来帮助这一要求………
    （原载苏联《汽笛报》第二十五期，一九二五年一月三十一日。）
            二、论写什么和怎样写
    在前几期的《农民报》上，我回答了许多有着共同意义的农民的来信。我的回答又引来了大批的来信。
    从一方面来说，这一点应当是令人高兴的，因为它标志着：农村过着积极的政治生活，农民注意《农民报》，而且不只注意它的论文，还自己通过报纸充分地参加了苏维埃国家的建设，努力对地方政权的缺点方面起作用。对这种趋势无条件地应当帮助，应当帮助加强联系，加强报纸及其同人与农民读者群众的关系，因为它不只对农民是有益处的，而且对通过《农民报》直接了解农民需要的报纸同人是有益的。农村对他们将更接近些、亲近些，农村中所发生的生活习惯的改变过程也将清楚一些。
    另一方面，信件的来源是这样大，而个别人的力量又是这样弱，以至于不要说回答，就连读都失掉了可能性。当然，可以让会选择值得读的信的有经验的人先读这些来信。我在这方面曾尝试过，但其结果还不能估计出这个经验。但是不论如何——来信的分类是服务机关的最困难的工作之一。
    最好的方法——是直接读书；但是，如同我所说的，在这方面对我发生的结果如同对春初的水磨所发生的结果一样：水流把整个的水磨都淹了，水比堤还高，这样大量的水不只滑过磨盘，而且完全停止了水磨的工作。这些原因使我注意来信的通讯员所谓通讯工作的严肃性，报纸上报道农村中在作什么，来信者所在地在作什么。
    写给报纸的信件，虽然写上了我的名字，但已经不是私人的来信，私人的控诉，而是一种文件：它的作者想用自己的来信作为政治行动，使社会注意他所知道的坏事，暴露出坏事的根源，并时常提供医治坏事的适当方法。
    没有问题，不能只写生活的坏现象。只写坏现象——就是指出生活的一个方面，甚至是立体三角的一面，然而一个方面不能得出物整体的概念。只有在了解全面以后才能得到完整的概念。
    但是写给我的来信使我感觉多么难以处理，同样通讯员也是难于充分和全面地报道地方生活，因为他不可能成为各种事件的内行。
    每个通讯员大半都给自己划定他所能报道的问题的一定范围。应当直接地说，凡熟悉本身事务的人所写来的信，很少不用，如果它们不直接被发表的话，那么它们的思想，而且有时连形式都会被文学家引用在自己的作品中和被演说家引用到自己的讲词里。
    因此，如果来信作者要想（而什么样的作者能不这样想）他的来信不会不被采用、不被抛到以能够容纳大量纸头为特点的编辑部的字纸篓里的话，就必须很好地知道他所要写的对象。要知道编辑部与自己的读者的联系不足，例如，教授与自己的听众的联系那样，——报纸可以说是一个大型的议会或是一个经常开会的会议，参加这个会议的人们，自己学习着，自己还教别人学习。来信的通讯员所提出的问题不是像学生向自己的教员所提出的一样，而有时来信的作者是用他的问题来使自己的读者——编辑部加以考虑。
    我之所以说这些，即应当写有推动写作的严肃原因的东西，在写以前必须自己先好好地想过，最好是与别人讨论一下：这个问题是否值得与忙得不可开交的人去讨论。当决定或已经决定了必须写，就应当好好地写，起码要努力写得好一些。最好抄写它几遍，把多余的话删掉，把不清楚的写清楚，努力修改信中的一切文法错误，使得它成为清楚的，并且尽可能是漂亮的。
    关于这一点，我听到过成千次的反对：我们不值得把信件抄写几遍！写得不好也不怪我们——这里要什么漂亮，即使能用歪歪斜斜的字体写出自己的思想也是好的。为什么一定要好好地写，就是因为写得不好：如果都写得好好地，那么我也就不必说要好好地写了。如果某人承认他的信具有很大的意义，他要用这封信做一件大的社会工作，那么他就不会吝惜时间去抄写，也不会吝惜时间去与别人进行初步的讨论。
    那么，我们有充分的信心说，这封信将不会被抛弃，退一步说，这封信在通讯员的头脑中会留下印象的。
                      （原载苏联《农民报》第四十期，一九二四年。）
