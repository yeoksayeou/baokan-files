    Changchun Trust Company's Urban-Rural Trading Department
    Does a Good Job in Farm Implement Production and Sales
    Editor:
    The Changchun Trust Company's Urban-Rural Trading Department has organized urban-rural exchanges effectively, supplying farmers with quality and affordable farm implements, and supporting and improving the production of farm implements. To this end, the company first conducted a survey of farm implement production in Changchun, and in mid-January, in cooperation with the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, held a forum for woodworking farm implement businesses, harness businesses, cart manufacturing businesses, and iron industries. After repeated consultations and based on past experience in promoting farm implements, the following measures were established for organizing farm implement production and sales: (1) Enter into sales and ordering contracts with farm implement manufacturers. Through contracts, the company solved the problems of lack of funds and raw materials for these businesses by ordering goods, providing advances, and acquiring inventory. The contract also stipulated that products of poor quality or unsuitable for farmers' needs could be returned or exchanged. The company has now acquired more than 10,000 pieces of various farm implements such as hoe blades, horse muzzles, iron shovels, and corn threshers, which are sold to farmers through county cooperatives. In order to help wooden farm implements and harness manufacturers solve the problem of raw materials, the company went to the places of origin of wood and leather to purchase them. (2) Strengthen ties with county and district cooperatives, and organize promotion and survey teams to go to the countryside. The company's urban-rural trading department sends out a farm implement price list every ten days to introduce the production of farm implements in Changchun, so as to process orders in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the needs of cooperatives in various places. (3) Assign dedicated personnel to inspect the quality of farm implements. Inspection personnel should go deep into factories, and based on the needs of farmers, help various manufacturing industries improve technical conditions and production methods. For example, last year farmers reported that the hoe blades produced in Changchun were very good, but the "nose" was not easy to use. Now improvement suggestions have been made to the hoe blade furnace, and the workers have made a guarantee to make the hoe blade nose stronger than last year. Special and timely inspections should be carried out for large orders of farm implements to prevent quality and specifications from not meeting requirements, which would affect promotion and use.

    长春信托公司城乡交易部
    农具产销工作作得好编辑同志：
    长春信托公司城乡交易部曾以有效的办法组织城乡交流，供给农民质好价廉的农具，并扶助和改进了农具业的生产。为此，该公司曾首先对长春市的农具生产情况进行了调查，并于一月中旬配合市工商局召开了木农具业、马具业、大车制造业、铁工业的座谈会。经过一再磋商，及根据过去推销农具的经验，对组织农具的生产及销售订出了以下办法：（一）与农具制造业订立代销及订货合同。通过合同，该公司以向各业主订货、垫款及收购存货等，解决了他们缺乏资金及原料的困难。合同并规定产品质量不好或不适合农民需要的可以退换。现该公司已收购了锄板、马兜嘴、铁锹、苞米脱粒机等各种农具一万余件，通过各县合作社，销售给农民。该公司为帮助木农具及马具制造业解决原料的困难，并赴木材、皮革出产地着手收购。（二）加强对县区合作社联系，组织推销调查小组下乡，该公司城乡交易部每隔十天发出一次农具价格表，介绍长春市农具生产情况，以根据各地合作社的需要有计划有步骤地进行加工订货。（三）设专人检查农具质量。使检查人员深入工厂，根据农民要求，帮助各制造业改进技术条件与生产方法。像去年农民反映长春出产的锄板很好，而“掉鼻子”不好使，现已与锄板炉提出改进意见，工人们已提出保证要把锄板掉鼻子打的比去年结实。对订立大批农具应特别进行及时的检查，以防止质量规格不符而影响推销与使用。
