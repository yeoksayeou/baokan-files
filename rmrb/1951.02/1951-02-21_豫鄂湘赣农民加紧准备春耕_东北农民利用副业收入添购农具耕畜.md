　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th: After the Spring Festival, preparations for spring planting have intensified in rural areas of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. Land reform is underway in most areas of the four provinces, and land reform has been completed in some villages. The production enthusiasm of farmers in various places has significantly increased. This year's spring planting preparations are generally better than in the past. In the paddy fields of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, most areas underwent winter plowing and irrigation last winter. In Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi, counties have removed rice roots from rice paddies to prevent rice borers, with 260,000 farmers participating in the root removal. From last winter to this spring, farmers have accumulated more fertilizer than in previous years. In Hunan and Jiangxi, many lime kilns have been restored because farmers want to buy lime for fertilizing their fields. Farmers in various places are also collecting manure, digging pond mud, and sweeping up leaves and weeds more than in previous years. Miao Wu Village in Changde County, Hunan, has accumulated more than one-third of the village's fertilization amount in previous years, but the farmers in the village still feel that it is not enough and are still working hard to collect manure and create fertilizer. Zhao Guanying Village in Baofeng County, Henan, has accumulated 17,000 carts of fertilizer, which can provide one more cart per mu of land than last year. Farmers in Yiyang County, Jiangxi, have accumulated about 100 dan of fertilizer per household this year. Farmers are also enthusiastic about repairing water conservancy facilities. According to statistics from Changsha, Liuyang, and Xiangtan counties in Hunan, 8,000 ponds have been repaired. Farmers in Banqiao and two other townships in Hengyang and Huilong Township in Xiangtan repaired 237 ponds in less than half a month. Many farmers who have newly received land have bought farm animals and tools. Farmers in the Seventh District of Jiujiang County, Jiangxi, recently purchased more than 50 cattle and more than 300 farm tools. Chengxi Township in Wugang County and Yaobei Township in Chaling County, Hunan, have also recently purchased more than 40 cattle and some farm tools. Farmers in areas where land reform has been completed are making many production plans.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th: Farmers in most rural areas of Northeast China, who have gained huge incomes from developing winter sideline production, are adding carts and horses, and purchasing agricultural implements, in preparation for expanding agricultural production this year with favorable material conditions. According to statistics from 41 counties in the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong, farmers' sideline income totaled 1.3 trillion Northeast currency. As of the end of last year, farmers' sideline income in ten counties of Rehe Province totaled 2,800 tons of grain. Most of the farmers in the above-mentioned areas have used their sideline income to add carts and horses and purchase farm tools. According to a survey of Panshi, Qianguo Banner, and Shulan counties in Jilin Province alone, farmers have used their sideline income to buy 320 carts and more than 1,300 head of livestock. Farmers in Kuandian County, Liaodong, bought 400 head of livestock with their sideline income in two months. Chagou Village in the county added more than 30 new carts. Incomplete statistics from ten counties in Heilongjiang show that 751 carts have been purchased. In addition to buying 368 carts and 423 head of livestock with the income from sideline production, farmers in Zhaoyuan County in the province have also purchased more than 10,600 various agricultural implements.
