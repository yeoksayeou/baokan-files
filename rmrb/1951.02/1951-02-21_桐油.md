　　Tung Oil

　　Tung oil is a native product in China that is linked to millions of farmers. Especially in the south, its importance in farmers' lives can be seen in the saying, "Plant a thousand tung trees, and you'll never be poor in your life."

　　Tung oil was often the top export item in China's foreign trade in the past. In terms of production, it accounted for over 95% of the world's annual output in the past, and now it still accounts for about 80%.

　　Tung oil is extracted from the fruit of the tung tree. The tung tree is a deciduous tree that resembles the Chinese parasol tree. It is highly adaptable to planting, especially in hilly and mountainous areas; however, it is most susceptible to cold. There are five types of tung trees. The type produced in China is the "Three-Year Tung." As the saying goes, "In the first year, it's a stick; in the second year, it's a branch; in the third year, you can pick tung seeds." Hence, it is called Three-Year Tung. The second type is the "Thousand-Year Tung," because this type of tung tree has a longer lifespan (wild ones can live for hundreds of years). The Three-Year Tung is widely distributed in China, between 22 and 33 degrees north latitude and 100 and 120 degrees east longitude, wherever the winter temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius. The Thousand-Year Tung is less cold-resistant and only grows in warmer areas south of the Yangtze River. The provinces with the most tung trees are Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Hubei, Yunnan, and Guizhou, followed by Guangxi and Guangdong, and fewer in Fujian, Anhui, Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. Sichuan and Hunan have the highest output. The oil quality is best in Sichuan; it was awarded a special prize at the Canadian Oil Quality Competition in 1929.

　　Tung oil has a wide range of uses; in the past, it was used in over 850 industrial applications. Tung oil has many characteristics that other oils do not possess; the most significant is its strong adhesion. Because its juice contains unsaturated fatty acids, it easily absorbs oxygen and combines with it to form solid oxides, thus having a protective effect. It also has the functions of preventing corrosion, moisture, insect damage, and cracking. Therefore, exposed parts of ships, airplanes, and submarines must be coated with tung oil paint. In addition, it has important uses in the manufacture of ink, oilcloth, refining kerosene and gasoline, electrical insulation, and the paper industry.

　　Tung oil is an export commodity with relatively high profits. Therefore, in 1936, when Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi occupied Guangxi, they established the Guangxi Trade Office to monopolize the purchase of tung oil at fixed prices in order to exploit the people; they also forced the people to plant tung trees to plunder huge profits. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, bureaucratic capitalists used their political and transportation advantages to quickly drive private merchants out of the market. Subsequently, the Kuomintang Finance Ministry, under the puppet government, intensified its efforts by ordering the Fuxing Company to monopolize the purchase and sale, trying its best to suppress the purchase price. Due to reduced sales channels and excessively low prices (at the lowest, the selling price of one dan of tung oil could only buy one shi of rice), the people even chopped down the tung trees they had painstakingly cultivated for firewood. Even more severely, the Kuomintang bandits cruelly exploited the people by using the monopolized purchase and sale method. For example, Article 12 of the monopolized sales method stipulated: "If tung farmers' pressing mills store tung fruits, tung seeds, or tung kernels, and are suspected of hoarding, the Fuxing Company may order them to press the oil and sell it to the Fuxing Company within a specified period." As a result, the poor tung farmers suffered even more severe oppression. Also, Article 16 stated: "After the confiscation of private oil... half of the oil price obtained shall be used as a reward, with informants receiving three-tenths of the total, and the seizing agency receiving two-tenths." This was simply treating the tung farmers as thieves. Later, in December 1941, because the southwest highway could not be opened to traffic, the Kuomintang reactionaries felt unable to transport the oil and canceled the monopolized purchase and sale method that exploited the people.

　　After liberation, under the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, and promoting domestic and foreign trade, the People's Government encouraged and assisted private merchants in exporting tung oil. For example, last year, the estimated export volume reached about 90% of the average of the highest export period in the past (1933-1937). At the same time, under the direction of uniting private merchants and advancing together, monopolized sales were not implemented. In the second quarter of last year, due to individual illegal private merchants undercutting prices by subsidizing foreign exchange, foreign prices declined. At that time, some people suggested that the People's Government implement monopolized sales, but the government, adhering to the policy of considering both public and private interests, did not implement monopolized sales, but actively sought ways to cooperate with private merchants to overcome the difficulties and strive for the initiative in international market prices.

　　Tung oil production in China is still a semi-natural production undertaking, so its precise production cost is difficult to calculate. However, from rough calculations and past experience, if one city dan of tung oil can maintain the price of three shi of white rice, tung farmers will have the interest to produce it. Last year, state-owned oil and fat institutions have been taking care of the interests of farmers, and the purchase price in each region has generally been maintained at around 500 jin of rice per dan. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries used this native product to make money for themselves and buy guns to fight the people; after liberation, the people use this native product to exchange for rice, cloth, and buy agricultural tools, so that the farmers in the tung oil producing areas have benefited. This is a stark contrast between different eras. In the future, due to its wide range of uses and under the correct policies of the country, after uniting private merchants and working together, the sales of tung oil in China will not be a problem.

### 桐油

　　桐油
    桐油在我国是关联着千百万农民的一项土产。特别是在南方，从流传着的“家种千株桐，一世永不穷”的俗语中，可以看出它在农民生活中的地位。
    桐油在我国出口贸易中，过去经常列在首位。而在生产方面，过去占世界年产量的百分之九十五以上，现在亦达百分之八十左右。
    桐油是由油桐树的果实中炼榨出来的。油桐树是一种落叶乔木，形似梧桐，种植适应力极强，以丘陵山地为最宜；但最怕寒冷。油桐可以分为五种。我国所产的是“三年桐”。民谚说：“一年是条棒，两年是条义，三年就有桐子摘。”所以称为三年桐。其次是“千年桐”。因为这种桐树寿命较长久（野生的可活数百年）。我国油桐分布区域甚广，自北纬二百二十度至三百三十度，东经一百度至一百二十度之间，凡冬季温度在摄氏二十度以上的地方，均宜种植三年桐。千年桐耐寒性较差，仅生长在长江以南较暖的地方。各省植桐最多的是四川、湖南、浙江、湖北、云南、贵州，其次是广西、广东，较少的是福建、安徽、陕西、河南、江西、江苏。产量以四川、湖南最多。油质以四川最好，一九二九年加拿大油质比赛大会上曾列为特等。
    桐油的用途很广，过去曾经应用于八百五十余种工业方面。桐油有许多为其他油类所不及的特点，最显著的是粘着力强；因其质汁中含不饱和脂肪酸，极易吸收氧气与之化合为固体氧化物，故有保护物质的作用；又能防腐、防潮、防虫伤、防止破裂的功能，所以，船只、飞机、潜水艇的暴露部分，都要涂上桐油涂料。此外，如在制造油墨、油布，提炼煤油、汽油，电器绝缘，制纸工业等方面，都有重要的用途。
    桐油是出口物品之一，较有利益。因此，一九三六年，李宗仁、白崇禧盘踞广西的时候，为搜刮人民，设立了广西贸易处，专事限价收购桐油；并迫令老百姓植桐，掠夺厚利。抗战时，官僚资本家更利用政治上及运输上的优越条件，将私商很快地逐出市场。嗣后，更变本加厉地由伪财政部明令复兴公司统购统销，尽力压价收购，老百姓在销路缩减、售价过低的情况下（最低时一担桐油售价仅可得米一石），曾将自己辛勤培植的桐树砍伐当柴烧。更厉害的是，国民党匪帮利用统购统销办法残酷搜刮人民。如统销办法第十二条规定：“桐农榨坊存储桐果、桐子、桐仁，如查有囤积嫌疑，得由复兴公司规定期限勒令榨油售予复兴公司”。因而贫苦的桐农更遭受了严重的压榨。又如第十六条：“私油没收后……以所得油价半数充奖，有眼线者给予眼线全部十分之三，缉获机关十分之二”，这简直是把桐农当成了盗贼。后至一九四一年十二月，因西南公路不能通车，国民党反动派感到无法运输，才取消了搜刮人民的统购统销的办法。
    解放后，人民政府在公私兼顾、内外交流的方针下，鼓励协助私商外销。如以去年为例，输出量估计约达过去输出最高时期（一九三三——一九三七）平均数的百分之九十。同时，在团结私商、共同前进的方向下，并未实行统销。在去年第二季中，因个别不法私商，以贴补外汇方法低抛，致国外价格垂萎。当时，有人曾建议人民政府统销，但政府亦因贯彻公私兼顾政策，并未实行统销，而积极设法并与私商团结协作，度过了难关，并争取到在国际市场价格上的主动。
    桐油的生产在我国尚是一种半自然状态的生产事业，所以它的精确生产成本是很难计算的。但从粗略的计算，以及过去的经验上看，如一市担桐油能维持三石白米的价格，则桐农是有生产兴趣的。去年，国营油脂机构，就一直照顾着农民的利益，一般是各区收购的价格，每担都能维持到五百斤米左右。过去国民党反动派利用这种土产赚钱自肥，买枪炮打人民；解放后，老百姓用这种土产收入换米、换布、买农具，使桐油产地的农民得到了利益。这是不同时代的鲜明对比。今后我国的桐油，由于用途的广大，在国家的正确政策下，经过团结私商共同努力，销路是不成问题的。
