　　Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Workers
    Write Letter to Chairman Mao
    Commemorating "February 7th" and Reporting on Railway Construction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] On the eve of "February 7th," all the workers of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the construction of the railway. In their letter to Chairman Mao on February 5th, the railway workers said: In the past six months, from June of last year to now, we have victoriously completed 5.07 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, built 34 bridges and culverts, 11 tunnels, and laid 83 kilometers of railway tracks. Currently, eight brand-new locomotives have been installed and are running back and forth on the 83-kilometer line. During the railway construction, the workers' enthusiasm for labor continued to grow, and labor efficiency increased daily. Initially, they could only lay 300 to 400 meters of track per day, but recently this has increased to 4 kilometers and 80 meters. The letter stated: This railway was built entirely by the power of the Chinese people themselves, and we must build it to the very best, so that those who do not believe in the construction capabilities of Chinese workers can see. The letter mentioned that they have recently launched a patriotic production competition to resist America and aid Korea, determined to inherit the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" struggle, and strive to complete the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule.

    纪念“二七”报告修筑铁路情况
    【新华社重庆七日电】成渝铁路全体职工“二七”前夕写信给毛主席，报告该路修筑情况。该路职工在二月五日给毛主席的信中说：从去年六月到现在的半年多里，我们已胜利地完成了五百零七万公方的土石工程，建筑了三十四座桥梁涵洞、十一座隧道，铺好了八十三公里的铁轨。目前已装好八部崭新的机车，在八十三公里的路线上来往行驶。在筑路工程中，工人劳动热情不断增长，劳动效率逐日提高，开始时每天只能铺轨三、四百公尺，最近已提高到四公里零八十公尺。信中说：这条铁路是完全靠中国人民自己的力量修的，我们一定要把它修得顶好，让那些不相信中国工人建设能力的人们看看。信中说到他们最近已展开了抗美援朝的爱国主义生产竞赛，决继承“二七”斗争的光荣传统，为提前完成成渝路的修建而努力。
