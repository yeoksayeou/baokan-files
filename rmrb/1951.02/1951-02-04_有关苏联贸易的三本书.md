　　*Soviet Trade* succinctly explains the essence of Soviet trade and its role in the socialist national economy, and demonstrates the superiority of socialist trade. From the very beginning of Soviet trade, it has possessed a new socialist character and content. Soviet trade differs from the trade of capitalist countries. Due to the planned management of the socialist national economy, Soviet trade is also planned. The commercial trade of the Soviet Union aims to reduce the cost of goods as much as possible, minimize commercial expenses, and accelerate the circulation of goods to meet the ever-increasing consumer demands of the broad society. Based on the socialist public ownership, Soviet commerce naturally does not have the contradiction between production and consumption, nor the threat of product stagnation. Commodity production is not for the pursuit of profit, but to improve the material and cultural level of the working people in a planned and step-by-step manner. In addition to the above, the book also provides a concise introduction to the forms of Soviet trade, such as state-owned trade, cooperative trade, and collective farm trade.
　　*Soviet Foreign Trade* is a section translated from the Soviet Encyclopedia, which clearly illustrates the characteristics and role of Soviet foreign trade in various historical stages. The Soviet economy is socialist, therefore Soviet foreign trade must be uniformly managed by the state. This characteristic of Soviet foreign trade gives it powerful strength and plays a significant role. It is not conducted blindly in pursuit of profit, but serves the needs of the current national economy and is determined according to the national economic plan. Therefore, it has different foreign trade policies for different economic tasks in various historical stages. Soviet trade policy is also a part of Soviet foreign policy, and it is an important means of revolutionary mutual assistance with people's democratic countries, as well as economic and political struggle with capitalist countries.
　　*Soviet Consumer Cooperatives* introduces the nature of Soviet cooperatives and their development and role in various stages of socialist construction. Lenin once stated: "Consumer cooperatives are a combination of workers and peasants to obtain and distribute the goods they need." The consumer cooperative under the socialist system is fundamentally different from the fragile cooperative organizations of capitalism. Cooperatives under the capitalist system cannot resist the capitalists' attack on the working people. The book points out that after the victory of the great October Revolution, Soviet cooperatives have been fully developed and have organized the commodity combination between urban and rural areas, thereby consolidating the alliance of workers and peasants. At the same time, the consumer cooperative is also a school for educating farmers, from which farmers can learn the civilization of cities and industries, and the methods of collective management. In short, Soviet consumer cooperatives use various methods to meet the needs of the urban and rural working people and promote the vigorous prosperity of socialism. (Ding Chuanxin)

    《苏联的贸易》简明扼要地说明了苏联贸易的本质及其在社会主义国民经济中所起的作用，并说明社会主义贸易的优越性。从苏维埃贸易产生之日起，它就具有社会主义的新的性质和新的内容。苏维埃贸易不同于资本主义国家的贸易，由于社会主义的国民经济管理计划化，苏维埃贸易也是具有计划性的。苏联的商业贸易，就是为了极力减轻商品成本，极力减少商业费用，加速商品的流通过程，以满足广大社会日渐增加的商品消费的。立足于社会主义公有制基础上的苏联商业，当然不会有生产与消费的矛盾，没有产品滞销的威胁，商品生产不是为追求利润，而是有计划有步骤的提高劳动人民的物质文化水平。除上述之外，本书对于苏维埃贸易的形式，诸如国营贸易、合作社贸易和集体农场贸易，也作了简明的介绍。
    《苏联的对外贸易》是译自苏联大百科全书中的一节，很明确地说明了苏联各历史阶段的对外贸易的特征和所起的作用。苏联经济是社会主义的，因而苏联的对外贸易必然地要由国家来统一经营。苏联对外贸易的这一特色，使它具有强大的力量和发挥重大的作用。它不是为追求利润盲目进行，而是服务于当前国民经济的需要，依据全国经济计划来决定的，因而在各个历史阶段的不同的经济任务上，也就有着不同的对外贸易方针。苏联贸易政策，也是苏联外交政策的一部分，是和人民民主国家进行革命的互助，以及和资本主义国家进行经济斗争、政治斗争的重要手段之一。
    《苏联的消费合作社》这本小册子，简明地介绍了苏联合作社的性质和它在社会主义建设各阶段中的发展及其作用。列宁曾说明：“消费合作社，就是工人和农民为取得并分配他们所必需的物品而成立的一种组合。”社会主义制度下的消费合作社，根本不同于资本主义的脆弱的合作组织。资本主义制度下的合作社丝毫不能抵抗资本家对劳动人民的进攻。本书指出：在伟大的十月革命胜利之后，苏联合作社就得到了充分的发展，并且组织了城市和乡村间的商品结合，从而巩固了工农的联盟。同时消费合作社也是教育农民的一所学校，农民可以从此学习到城市和工业的文明，和集体经营的方法。总之苏联消费合作社，用种种的办法来满足城市、乡村劳动人民的需要，并且促进了社会主义蓬勃的繁荣。（丁传信）
