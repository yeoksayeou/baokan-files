Jinan Railway Bureau Jinan Station
	Should Improve Cargo Consignment Procedures

	I went to Jinan last December to buy goods. After I bought the goods and packed them into sacks, I sent them to the station for consignment. I arrived at the station at 3:00 PM and didn't complete the procedures until 9:00 PM. I thought it was an isolated incident, so I didn't pay much attention to it. On January 25th of this year, I went to Jinan again to purchase goods, and after packing them, I went to the station for consignment. I arrived at the station at 3:15 PM. At that time, the goods going north were already lined up in one and a half rows (in Jinan, goods are delivered to the north, south, and east, each forming a row). However, around 5:10 PM, the comrades handling the procedures went to eat, and they had not returned by 6:15 PM. By this time, the goods going north had lined up in five rows. I had to catch the slow train to Tianjin at 8:05 PM, so I couldn't wait and had to haul the goods to the freight yard. While I was waiting to consign the goods, I asked the person next to me, "Is it common to wait like this here?" He replied, "This is a common occurrence." This is too much of a waste of the consignor's time. I suggest that Jinan Station should find ways to improve the consignment procedures, or like Beijing Station, accept consignments as soon as they arrive, to avoid consignors waiting for a long time. I think the service spirit of the working comrades at Jinan Station is far inferior to that of Beijing Station, and I hope for improvement.

### 济南铁路管理局济南车站  应改善货物托运手续

　　济南铁路管理局济南车站
　  应改善货物托运手续
    编辑同志：
    我于去年十二月间到济南买货，货买齐了装上麻袋即送往车站托运。到站的时间是下午三点，等到九点才办完手续。我以为这是偶然现象，所以也未注意。今年一月二十五日又至济南购货，包装好了又往车站托运。到站的时间是下午三点一刻，这时往北去的货已经排成一行半了（济南交货分往北去、南去、东去各排成行）。但等到五点十分左右，办手续的同志们吃饭去了，六点十五分还没回来。这时往北去的已经排成五行了。我要坐八点零五分的慢车到天津，等不了，所以又将货拉到货栈上去。当我在等着托运时，问旁边的人：“这里常这样等着吗？”他回答：“这是常有的事。”这样对托运人的时间是太浪费了。我建议济南车站应设法改善交件手续，或者像北京站那样随到随交，以免托运人久候。我看济南车站工作同志的服务精神，远不如北京站的好，亦希望改进。
