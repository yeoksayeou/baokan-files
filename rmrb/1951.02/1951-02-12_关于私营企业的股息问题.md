　　On the Question of Dividends for Private Enterprises
    Editor:
    The People's Daily's January 17th editorial, "The Correct Path for the Development of Private Enterprises," pointed out that dividends for private enterprises can reach an annual interest rate of 8%. However, the current annual interest rate for bank deposits is around 20%. Under the rule of average profit rates, this difference in profit cannot exist for long, and the capital of private industry and commerce will inevitably flow into banks. Therefore, I doubt what benefit such dividends have for the development of private enterprises. Please explain.

    Comrade Cao Zhengang: The reason why bank deposit interest rates are not used as the standard for dividends is that bank deposit interest rates are determined according to market supply and demand of funds and are subject to change. The dividends of enterprises should generally be stipulated in the articles of association. If they are set too high, it will cause difficulties for the enterprise operators and affect the development of the enterprise itself, which is clearly detrimental to investors. Moreover, the main purpose of investors is to receive dividends. If it is only to obtain interest, it is of course more stable and reliable to deposit in a bank.

　　关于私营企业的股息问题
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月十七日社论“私营企业正确发展的途径”中指出：私营企业的股息可达年息百分之八。但目前银行存款年息则为百分之二十上下，在利润率的平均法则支配下，这种利润的差异是不可能长期存在的，私营工商业的资本必然流入银行。因此我怀疑这样的股息，对发展私营企业有什么好处，请解答。
                                                中共定县地委  曹振刚
    曹振刚同志：为什么不以银行存款利率作为股息的标准，是因为银行存款利率系根据市场资金供求情况决定的，时有变动。而企业的股息一般应于章程中订定，如果规定得太高，会使企业经营者发生困难，同时影响到企业本身的发展，这对投资人显有不利。且投资人的主要目的是在于分红，如果仅仅为了取得股息，那当然不如存入银行稳当可靠了。
