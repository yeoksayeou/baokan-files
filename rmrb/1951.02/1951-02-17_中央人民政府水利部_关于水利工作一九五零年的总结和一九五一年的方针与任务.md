Summary of Water Conservancy Work in 1950 and Guidelines and Tasks for 1951
(Approved by the 67th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on January 12, 1951)

A. Summary of Work in 1950

The water conservancy work in 1950 was carried out on the basis of long-term neglect of river channels nationwide, dilapidated dikes, incomplete basic data, the absence of complete management plans for most rivers, and the weak water conservancy institutions at all levels, coupled with the people's urgent demand for water management after the severe floods of 1949. Therefore, due to the short time and heavy tasks, most of the work involved temporary projects alongside surveying and research. The management of most rivers aimed to achieve specific goals and provide conditional and limited guarantees. Although the management of a few rivers had started to incorporate fundamental solutions, it could not be completed within a year. This was the basic situation of our work in 1950.

Over the past year, there have been achievements and shortcomings.

In terms of river works, the total amount of earthwork completed nationwide, including in the newly liberated areas and by the people in repairing dikes, reached over 419 million cubic meters, with the active participation of more than 320,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, resulting in significant achievements. With such massive projects, most of the over 42,000 kilometers of dikes nationwide were reinforced, and important hazardous sections were strengthened with dams and revetments. Many of the projects in 1950 had the nature of work relief, mobilizing 4.69 million civilian workers nationwide, enabling over 10 million people in disaster areas, including their families, to overcome the famine. Due to the increased political awareness of the people after liberation, the average work efficiency in various regions has improved compared to the past. The quality of the projects has generally improved, with many regions meeting the required standards, and even areas without the habit of manual ramming have laid a preliminary foundation. In terms of construction leadership, some regions experienced errors and deviations in the early stages of construction, resulting in certain losses and waste. After review and correction, most regions have gained and created excellent experiences.

In terms of irrigation, the projects invested or loaned by the central government have increased the irrigated area by 3,711,487 mu. In addition, the renovation of old canals and small-scale private projects have benefited over 13 million mu. Larger projects, such as the Luohui Canal in Shaanxi, which had been delayed for 18 years without formal water release, irrigated 100,000 mu of farmland in 1950. In Xinjiang, the completion of large and small irrigation projects has increased the area of paddy fields by 860,000 mu. In terms of canal management, most regions have overthrown the old rules of water use controlled by feudal forces in the past and have begun to establish a democratic management system. For example, in Shaanxi, the irrigation area of each canal has been expanded by 250,000 mu due to improved management methods.

In terms of the effectiveness of flood control, except for the Huai River basin in Henan and northern Anhui, which suffered disasters due to excessive rainfall, most rivers and regions were able to complete their tasks according to the guaranteed standards, playing an important role in ensuring agricultural production and protecting the lives and property of the people along the rivers. For example, although the floods in the Yellow River in 1950 were not large, they did not cause any problems after the last flood surge during the withdrawal period. The flood control project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River basin, the Xin沂 River project in northern Jiangsu, and the downstream regulation project of the Chaobai River in North China all withstood the floods of 1950 and had a significant effect in reducing water disasters. The flood control of the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, East China, bore the enormous floods of the Huai River without breaches. Although the rivers in Hebei Province could not accommodate larger floods due to narrow river channels, and some breaches still occurred, the efforts of the leadership and the masses in rescue and timely plugging and drainage reduced the disaster and increased the wheat planting area. Other small and medium-sized rivers in other regions generally avoided or mitigated flood disasters through strengthened dikes and manual protection.

As for the floods in the Huai River in 1950, the main reason was that the floods were too large, far exceeding the capacity of the existing river channels and dikes and the effectiveness of manual protection. The nine years of sedimentation in the Yellow River after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the dikes at Huayuankou in 1938 was also an important cause of this flood. During the Water Conservancy Joint Conference in 1949, the river channel topography of the Huai River had undergone great changes due to the impact of the Yellow River floods, and the previous plans were no longer applicable. It was impossible to propose a comprehensive management plan at that time, so it was only temporarily decided to repair the main dikes according to the flood level of 1931 and to carry out partial dredging. However, according to the measured records and calculations, although the total flood volume during the flood season in 1950 was less than in 1931, the flood peak above Zhengyangguan was higher than in 1931 due to the concentrated rainfall and high riverbed. According to the measured and calculated results, if there were no breaches, the flow rate at Zhengyangguan would be 13,150 cubic meters per second, and at Bengbu it would be 15,800 cubic meters per second, while the channel capacity of the above two places was only 6,000 cubic meters per second and 8,400 cubic meters per second, respectively. Therefore, after the flood overflowed and breached the dikes, the water level at Zhengyangguan still exceeded the highest water level in 1931 by 0.69 meters, and Bengbu also exceeded it by 0.98 meters. It was impossible to propose a management plan for such a once-in-decades super flood at the Water Conservancy Joint Conference in 1949, and it was also impossible to complete such a huge project within half a year in terms of time, manpower, and financial resources. However, during the flood period, individual dike sections above Zhengyangguan, such as Wang Jieliu, collapsed before reaching the guaranteed standard, which should be deeply reviewed by the competent authorities, and these errors cannot be covered up by the subsequent excessive floods.

In terms of hydrology, surveying, and planning research, although there were insufficient cadres, much work was still carried out. In terms of hydrology, 365 hydrological stations and 589 water level stations were added nationwide, and the sorting of hydrological data is also being carried out systematically. In terms of surveying and research, in addition to carrying out work in coordination with the engineering design of 1950, systematic surveying and planning of some major rivers has also been carried out.

The above are the main achievements of our work in 1950. The main reasons why we were able to achieve these achievements were the leadership of the local Party and government organs and the support of the people across the country. In addition, the relevant departments also gave great help.

On the other hand, there are still some serious shortcomings in our leadership and work that must be overcome.

First, there were too many projects, and the key points were not well grasped. Some regions had the idea of ​​rebuilding everything, only thinking that doing more projects would benefit the people, but not realizing that if the projects were not done well, it would only waste manpower and materials, and instead cause losses to the people. Some plans were too large, exceeding the possibility of manpower and material resources. Some were based on the plans of the enemy and puppets without careful research and revision. Some only carried out work without a comprehensive and specific engineering plan. Many projects were roughly planned and revised again and again, such as the aforementioned Chaobai River project in North China and the Daoyi project in northern Jiangsu. Although they were successfully completed, they caused great passivity in the construction process. Some projects could actually be postponed (such as the Huaiyin Ship Lock Hui Lock project). Some projects have suffered losses because the technical strength cannot keep up, the plans are imperfect, or construction is carried out without a plan.

Second, insufficient investigation and research and insufficient systematic inspection prevented us from discovering problems and correcting errors in a timely manner. For example, the levee repair plan of the Longhe South Dike in the Yongding River Pan-Flood Area, which was handled by the North China Engineering Bureau, did not take into account the changes in the river situation at the Lianggezhuang outlet. Although it was close at hand, we did not conduct actual inspections and did not discover and correct the shortcomings of this plan in time, which also had a great impact on the breach of the Yongding River Pan-Flood Area in 1950. In other cases, such as the levee restoration project in individual areas, some did not study in detail how much flood could come and how large the river channel capacity was to determine the specific direction of management. They only repaired the original dike without knowing how much flood it could defend. Whether these rivers have suffered disasters in 1950 or not, they need to be studied and improved in the future.

Third, inaccurate calculation of project benefits caused waste. The decision of many projects was not based on a comparison of the calculation of engineering costs and project benefits, or even exaggerated the favorable conditions and ignored the possible difficulties, resulting in project waste. For example, the Ancixian County Chengbei Diversion Channel Project in the Yongding River Pan-Flood Area roughly estimated that it could protect and liberate more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields, and built dikes with frozen soil in the severe winter. As a result, the benefits were minimal, and the diversion channel was silted up during the flood season, wasting more than 400,000 catties of labor and grain. In addition, the Zhengnan Huai Dike, Renhuai Zhiduange Dike, and Shouxihuai Dike in northern Anhui were all intended to drain lake water and increase cultivated land. With water on both sides, building dikes on accumulated silt not only led to failure and waste, but also violated the principle of river management by competing with the lake for land.

Fourth, insufficient preparation before construction and lack of detailed and thorough organization and management during construction caused losses to the project. This shortcoming was almost universal in the early stages of construction in various regions except for a few areas. Although it was corrected, there were still recurring incidents. For example, during the winter repair in East China, Hongze and Wuwei counties in northern Anhui were not adequately prepared with housing, food, tools, and materials. After the migrant workers went to the dikes, they ate without working, and some left after eating because they had no houses to live in, wasting 1 million catties of grain. For example, during the mobilization of migrant workers in the Chaobai River New Channel Project in North China, no checks were made, and some old and weak people came who could not work. In addition, the migrant workers returned home due to rain, resulting in a total loss of 1 million catties of rice. In addition, there was a lot of waste in the transportation, storage, and use of materials.

Fifth, the financial organizations of work institutions at all levels are not sound, and individual areas have the idea of "emphasizing engineering and neglecting financial grain" or "not accounting after completing tasks". They cannot seriously implement the budget and final accounting system and the special funds for special purposes system, and freely transfer construction funds, resulting in financial chaos, increased waste, and contributing to the tendency of various places not to report plans and blindly start construction.

The above are the main shortcomings in our work in 1950.

B. Guidelines and Tasks for Work in 1951

Water conservancy work in 1951 has the following characteristics: First, consolidating national defense has become the current primary task. To obey this general policy, although water conservancy construction is closely related to the restoration and development of agricultural production, greater economy must still be exercised in the use of funds to maximize the effectiveness of certain funds. Second, in terms of water conservancy construction, because fundamental management has not yet been carried out, compared with the maximum flow of each river and the existing defense force, many major rivers still face the threat of severe floods. In terms of fundamental management research, some rivers have relatively mature plans, while others lack reasonable plans and need to continue research. In terms of work institutions, although they are roughly scaled, the number of technical cadres cannot meet the needs of the work. The development of irrigation is also lagging behind the urgent needs. Some areas do not have economical and reasonable use of existing channels.

Based on the above characteristics, the guiding principles for the work in 1951 are: in terms of flood control, general rivers should carry out key annual repairs and strict flood control, requiring that ordinary floods do not cause disasters; rivers with greater flood threats should vigorously strengthen dikes and protective works, striving to defend against higher floods; at the same time, according to needs and technical possibilities, key fundamental management projects of major rivers should be carried out. In terms of drainage, areas with severe waterlogging should be regarded as key points, vigorously promoted, and the masses should be encouraged and organized to carry out small-scale drainage projects. In terms of irrigation, equal importance should be attached to expansion and restoration, and equal importance should be attached to engineering and management. The projects that have been started should continue to be completed, the management of channels should be universally strengthened, and water should be used economically, with the aim of expanding the irrigated area on the existing basis. At the same time, key projects that are most needed and have obvious benefits should be selected. In terms of fundamental management research, systematic preparatory work should continue based on the engineering needs of flood control and drought prevention. As for the work of river channel regulation, etc., it should be carried out selectively according to economic strength and actual needs.

According to the above policy, the main projects of water conservancy to be carried out in 1951 are listed as follows:

(1) The Huai River System

Upper Reaches: Complete the Hongwangpo and other low-lying area flood storage and partial control works, and coordinate the flood storage project to partially regulate the Hong River, Ru River, Ying River, Shuangji River, and other river channels. Focus on Shangqiu, Chenliu, and Huaiyang special districts to carry out ditch projects and build culverts at the ditch mouths of major tributaries. In mountainous areas, focus on promoting soil and water conservation, and in hilly areas, promote pond projects, requiring completion before the flood season in 1951. Including natural flood storage in low-lying areas, strive to achieve a flood storage task of 2 billion cubic meters. Reservoirs in mountain valleys will be prepared and construction will begin selectively in winter.

Middle Reaches: The flood storage project in lakes and low-lying areas requires the completion of more than 4 billion cubic meters of effective flood storage. It should also be coordinated with the flood storage project to repair dikes and partially retreat them to accommodate the upstream flood volume. The main dikes on the north bank of the Huai River, the east dike of the Ying River, the tributary dikes of the Wo River, and the enclosing dikes of the Bengbu and Huainan mining areas, which ensure the wheat and autumn harvests, should be safe to defend the maximum flood flow as the standard. Other dike works should also be taken into account as a whole, and the standard of repair should be determined by studying the sections in accordance with the principle of small interests obeying large interests. As for river channel dredging, the main stream should first dredge the shallow section of Zhengyangguan, and the tributaries should focus on the Sui River and Xifei River, and coordinate the ditch projects to first solve the drainage needs of the wheat season in the basin of the two tributaries. In addition, the river mouths of the Qian River, Tian River, and Dongfei River should also be dredged, and the mouths of rivers such as Ming, Ci, and Gu should be stabilized. We should organize the masses to manage and repair the existing ponds in the counties.

Lower Reaches: The seaward waterway must continue to be studied and fully prepared for construction after the flood season in 1951. At present, the focus should be on strengthening the dikes of the Liyun River, renovating the dike slopes according to the flood level standard of 1931, strengthening the dangerous works, repairing the Guihai Dam, and clearing the obstacles in the waterways entering the Yangtze River and the Guihai port.

After the completion of the above projects, Henan and northern Anhui can achieve no disasters in small rains and fewer disasters in heavy rains. In northern Jiangsu, when the discharge of the three rivers does not exceed 8,500 cubic meters per second, the Lixiahe area can be kept safe. In severe and unavoidable situations, the Guihai Dam must still be opened to avoid breaches in the Yunhe Dike.

(2) The North China Water System

The management of the North China water system in recent years is temporarily determined to focus on the Yongding River, Chaobai River, and Daqing River. The Yongding River has begun to build the Guanting Reservoir and regulate the downstream river channel. The Chaobai River will complete the downstream regulation project as soon as possible and prepare for the upstream reservoir project. The Daqing River will find ways to store water upstream, and the downstream will complete the independent seaward flood diversion channel.

Engineering plan for 1951: The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River should complete the basic drilling work while promoting the necessary construction preparation work. The dikes and river channels below Lugou Bridge and in the Anci Pan-Flood Area should be appropriately regulated to lower the downstream flood level and ensure railway safety. The downstream regulation project of the Chaobai River should continue the work of 1950, including the dredging of the flood discharge channel below Huangzhuangwa. The dredging of the Qinglongwan River can reduce and avoid flood disasters in the counties along the Chaobai and Jiyun Rivers when the Chaobai River flood does not exceed 3,000 cubic meters per second, and ensure the wheat production in most areas. The Daqing River's independent seaward flood diversion channel will start to build the ship lock control gate at the intersection of the new flood diversion channel and the Grand Canal, Ziya River, and the basic project of the operating gate at the upper mouth of the flood diversion channel. The entire project will be completed before the flood season in 1953.

Drainage work in North China is also very important. In 1951, drainage works will be carried out in the area south of the Daqing River in Hebei Province, and in Pingyuan Province, the Zhao Wang River, Zhu River, and the Wei River near Xinxiang will be dredged. The above can protect about 3 million mu of farmland. General drainage work relies on local governments to mobilize the masses to carry out on their own.

The dikes of the Yongding, Ziya, Daqing, Grand Canal, North Canal, and Jiyun Rivers in Hebei Province should still be reinforced and consolidated to resist ordinary floods. The right bank of the Ziya and Grand Canal near Yangliuqing should be especially strengthened to ensure the safety of Tianjin. The west dike of the Grand Canal in Pingyuan Province, as well as the Jinxiangling Dike and the river head dike of Nanyang Lake, should also be regulated and strengthened.

The Jingu Waterway and Dagu sand of the Haihe River, which are used for silt discharge during the flood season in the upper reaches, should be dredged regularly to maintain the navigable channel to the sea and help the discharge of floods.

The fundamental solution to the North China water system depends on upstream reservoirs and soil and water conservation work. Due to limited manpower and financial resources, most of the projects in 1951 are still of a stopgap nature. Fundamental projects cannot be carried out on a large scale. However, the surveying and research work of the reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Chaobai River and the Daqing River should still be promoted, and soil and water conservation work should be tried out in the Yongding River and Daqing River basins to establish the foundation for fundamental solutions.

(3) The Yellow River

Within the next few years, the Yellow River should still strengthen bank protection and dike works, survey and prepare for the reservoir project between Tongguan and Mengjin, build tributary flood control and sediment retention reservoirs, and actively carry out soil and water conservation work in the main and tributary basins in conjunction with agricultural and forestry plans.

The focus of the work in 1951 is on regulating the downstream river channel and repairing and protecting dikes, including reinforcing the main dike, strengthening bank protection, blocking tributaries and connecting rivers, and consolidating beaches and rectifying dangerous areas, with the standard of discharging larger floods than in 1949. The dam sites of the three reservoirs in Tongguan, Sanmenxia, and Wangjiatan will be surveyed and drilled. Regarding soil and water conservation, the focus should first be on trying out the management of mountain streams and gullies in the Jing River basin. The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Project should continue to be promoted and completed before the flood season in 1953. The telecommunications and transportation equipment related to flood control and emergency rescue should be appropriately strengthened. The irrigation works in the Ningxia and Suiyuan areas in the upper reaches must also be actively prepared.

(4) The Yangtze River

The management of the Yangtze River in recent years focuses on regulating and controlling the lakes along the river to control the water level and flow. The flood control works of the Jingjiang River should be regarded as the key point. The focus of the Han River is on the regulation of the downstream channel and the construction of flood control reservoirs in the upper reaches.

In 1951, the main dikes of the Yangtze River and the main dikes of the Han River should be appropriately repaired and protected to ensure that no breaches occur at the same flood level as in 1949. The Jingjiang River Dike must be regarded as the key point and strengthened. The capacity of the Jingjiang River cannot safely carry the maximum flood volume of the Sichuan River. Flood diversion and storage plans should be surveyed and studied, and preparation work should be promoted. The Datong Lake flood storage reclamation area was generally completed in 1950. In 1951, the drainage channel should be improved to facilitate the discharge of inland water. Culverts should be selectively built at the intersection of inland rivers and the Yangtze River channel on both sides and at the outlets of drainage ditches inside the dikes to resist the invasion of the Yangtze River floods and facilitate the discharge of rainwater, with the aim of improving the production of 5 million mu of farmland. In addition to flood control and tide prevention projects, the downstream should study the regulation of river channels, beach protection, and dike protection. As for the upstream, the sources of floods, channel regulation, and multi-objective working conditions should be studied. The river channels of Yichang-Chongqing section, Hechuan-Chongqing section of Jialing River, and Leshan-Yibin section of Minjiang River should be partially regulated. The gate dams of Qijiang channelization should also be repaired to facilitate storage and discharge and achieve shipping benefits. Small-scale interception and water storage works should be tried out in the upper reaches of each tributary to lay the foundation for future promotion of soil and water conservation work.

(5) The Pearl River

Within the next few years, the Pearl River system should consolidate the dike system on the basis of existing dikes and weirs, build culverts selectively, shorten the defense line, strengthen the main dike, and actively carry out basic surveying and planning work, preparing to develop towards the middle and upper reaches.

The goal for 1951 is to consolidate the dikes of the East River, West River, and North River and ensure that ordinary flood levels do not cause disasters. During the flood season, efforts should be made to ensure that the highest flood level on record does not cause disasters. The same is true for other waterways in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, such as the Han River, Jian River, and Long River. The waterways such as Chencunli and Jiaowei near Guangzhou should be dredged to facilitate navigation. Culverts along the river should be built selectively to control discharge. Basic surveying work should also be actively strengthened for fundamental solutions.

(6) The Yi River and Shu River

The new river channel project of the downstream Yi River in northern Jiangsu was generally completed in 1950. In 1951, regulation should be coordinated in Shandong Province, and the new dike should be strengthened and the river channel improved in northern Jiangsu to safely discharge a flood volume of 3,200 cubic meters per second. The main drainage inland rivers such as the Liutang River, Guli River, Boyang River, and Wutu River on both sides of the Xinyi River should be dredged to relieve the rain and waterlogging disasters of 2.6 million mu of farmland. The new flood diversion channel project of the Shu River should continue the work of 1950. However, due to limited financial resources, only part of the stone works of the diversion channel and the dike works of the downstream Sha River can be completed in 1951. All the dike works of the upstream Shu River and the middle reaches of the Sha River will be completed, and efforts will be made to build the main culvert projects within the established funds to ensure that all projects are completed before the flood season in 1952.

(7) Other Rivers in East China and Central South China and Seawalls in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

The dike works of rivers in East China provinces, such as the Min River in Fujian, the Cao'e River in Zhejiang, and the Su River, Xiaoqing River, Daqing River, Bailang River, and North Canal in Shandong, should also be repaired to resist ordinary floods. The main dikes of the Dongjing River, Dongting Lake water system, and Poyang Lake water system in Central South China should also strive to ensure that no breaches occur at the same flood level as in 1949.

In 1951, the seawalls in southern Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang should continue to be repaired and focus on strengthening the pile stone dam sections and beach protection works to protect the coastal agricultural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The seawalls in Zhejiang are more severely damaged. Due to the impact of the tidal head of the Qiantang River, the design of the seawalls is also more complicated. Surveying and research and experimental work should be emphasized at the same time to achieve a fundamental solution.

(8) The Northeast Region

The management of the Liao River and Songhua River, the two major water systems in Northeast China, should focus on the Liao River water system in the next few years, especially the fundamental management project of the Raoyang River. The reservoir projects of the Hun River and the Taizi River should also be started. In 1951, the downstream of the Raoyang River should repair old dikes, complete new dikes, and build gates. The Dahuo Fang Reservoir on the Hun River should begin to make the necessary construction preparations. In addition to water management projects, the irrigation works of the East Liao River, Chahayang, and Panshan Farm should be promoted. Other projects will be funded and organized by the provinces themselves.

(9) Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

The water conservancy in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region focuses on the West Liao River water system. In 1951, the dikes and dangerous works should be strengthened on the existing basis to ensure that the dikes do not breach at the maximum flood level in 1949. For the fundamental management projects that take into account both flood control and irrigation, efforts should be made to survey and study the Shimenzi Reservoir on the Laoha River, a tributary in the upper reaches. In addition, various flood control, drainage, and siltation works in the Yalu River of the Hulunbuir League and the Taoer River of the Anxi League in the Songhua River system can be carried out selectively as needed. The work of sand prevention and soil conservation in the Xilamulun River basin of the West Liao River can also be tried out as appropriate.

(10) Flood Control and Drainage Projects in Northwest and Southwest Regions

Northwest Region: In 1951, Huaxian and Huayin counties in Shaanxi Province and the Hexi region in Ningxia should carry out drainage projects and selectively try out gully management and pond water storage.

Southwest Region: Flood control projects such as the Nanpan River and Panlong River in Yunnan and the Anning River in Xikang must be carried out as appropriate.

(11) Irrigation Projects Financed by Loans

Irrigation projects financed by loans focus on the Northwest Region. Due to the special terrain or the distribution of rainfall that does not match the agricultural season, other regions should also selectively carry out projects to ensure or increase agricultural production, including 10 projects such as the Houtao Huangyang Gate and Xiahe irrigation projects in the North China Region, 16 projects such as the Luohui Canal renovation and Hongyanchi Reservoir project in the Northwest Region, 6 projects such as the Binggang expansion irrigation project in the East China Region, 13 projects such as the Songpu District irrigation project in the Central South Region, and 13 projects such as the Siliyan weir renovation project in the Southwest Region. After the completion of all the projects, the preliminary estimate of the benefited land in 1951 is about 4,757,000 mu.

(12) Surveying and Hydrology

Basic work such as surveying hydrology experiments should be coordinated with the management direction of each river and the needs of the projects carried out in 1951, and teams should be organized to set up stations and focus on promotion. In 1951, we will first devote ourselves to enriching and adjusting the existing teams and stations, and expand them appropriately as financial resources permit. Regarding the plan for organizing teams and setting up stations, each basin and each province has a preliminary plan, which still needs to be carefully considered and decided in accordance with the above principles and the possibility of funding.

In order to realize the above guidelines and plans, it is necessary to truly grasp the key points in the work. Strengthen planning and design work and improve the plan review system. Strengthen the organization and leadership in the construction process and stipulate a unified system for migrant workers' wages. Improve the financial institutions and strengthen the financial work. The leadership relationship, division of labor and cooperation of water conservancy institutions at all levels should also be studied and improved.

In addition, regarding the issue of cadre training, because water conservancy work has been greatly expanded and there is an extreme shortage of technical cadres, a preliminary plan for training cadres has been formulated in 1951, which still needs to be carried out in coordination with the education department. (Attached picture)

Yi River and Shu River: In 1950, a new Yi River channel was opened and dikes were built on both sides for 800 li according to the principle of separate management of Yi and Shu. The second and third phases of the Shu River project were carried out. The two rivers completed a total of more than 45 million cubic meters of earthwork, which basically guaranteed the flood discharge during the flood season and reduced the historical disasters in northern Jiangsu. In 1951, the Yi River project will continue to be regulated and the inland rivers along the Xinyi River will be dredged to relieve the rain and waterlogging disasters of 2.6 million mu of farmland. The fourth phase of the Shu River project was completed on December 25 last year.

Liao River: In 1950, more than 54 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed for flood control and drainage, ensuring that 8.4 million mu of the 12 million mu flooded in 1949 were not affected by water disasters. In 1951, the focus is on strengthening the Raoyang River downstream by repairing dikes and building gates. The Hun River (see 12) and Taizi River (see 13) reservoir projects are being prepared.

North China Water System (including Daqing River, Ziya River, North Canal, Chaobai River, Yongding River): In 1950, the main projects were dike restoration, danger repair, and dredging, with a total of more than 27 million cubic meters of earthwork, reducing half of the 33 million mu flooded in 1949. In 1951, the downstream river channel of the Yongding River will be regulated, and the preparation work for the Guanting Reservoir (see 10) will continue. The Daqing River will start the flood diversion channel project (see 11) entering the sea through Duliu Town. The Haihe River will maintain the navigable channel to the sea, and the dikes of other rivers will be reinforced and consolidated. Drainage work will also be strengthened.

Yellow River: In 1950, the main projects were dike restoration and danger repair projects, with a total of more than 10 million cubic meters of earthwork and 350,000 cubic meters of stone work. More than 380,000 people were organized into emergency rescue teams during the flood season, thus overcoming the floods and preventing disasters. In 1951, the focus will still be on regulating the downstream river channel and repairing and protecting dikes, and promoting the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Project (see 5). The middle reaches will conduct drilling at the reservoir dam site (see 6). The upper reaches will plan the Ningxia-Suiyuan large irrigation area project (see 7), and try out the management of mountain streams and gullies in the Jing River in Shaanxi (see 8) to maintain soil and water in the upper reaches.

Yangtze River: In 1950, the main projects were dike restoration, Datong Lake (see 1) flood storage reclamation, and remote dike siltation (see 2), with a total of more than 130 million cubic meters of earthwork. After the flood season, the Yangtze River was basically free of disasters. In 1951, the upstream focuses on regulating the navigable channel, the middle reaches focus on consolidating the Jingjiang Dike (see 3), improving the Datong Lake drainage channel, and promoting the Han River Niapan Mountain Reservoir (see 4) project. The downstream will pay attention to flood control, tide prevention, beach protection, and dike protection projects.

Chaobai River: In 1950, the main projects were opening up a new downstream river channel (see 9), excavating a diversion river, repairing flood discharge gates, and river mouth gates. Earthwork alone amounted to more than 10 million cubic meters. During the flood season, the new river channel discharged water, ensuring that 3 million mu of farmland in the Jiyun River basin (see 14) were not affected by water disasters. This year, the downstream regulation project will continue, including dredging river channels and diversion rivers, so that when the Chaobai River flood flow does not exceed 3,000 cubic meters per second, flood disasters along the Chaobai and Jiyun Rivers will be reduced.

Huai River: The 1950 project mainly focused on dike restoration and dredging, with a total of more than 8 million cubic meters of earthwork. Due to the particularly large floods last year, and after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the dikes at Huayuankou in 1938, the Huai River water system was disrupted, causing serious water disasters in the middle and upper reaches. The downstream was heavily protected, ensuring a bumper harvest of 15 million mu of farmland in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the State Council made a decision to fundamentally manage the Huai River. In 1951, we will focus on both storage and discharge, building reservoirs to store more than 7 billion cubic meters of water in the middle and upper reaches, and regulate the river channel. The downstream will consolidate the Grand Canal dikes, increase the flood discharge capacity, and prepare to open up a seaward waterway. After the completion of this year's project, Henan and northern Anhui can reduce disasters; northern Jiangsu can guarantee the safety of the Lixiahe area when the discharge of the three rivers does not exceed 8,500 cubic meters per second.

General Explanation: 1950 was the first year of comprehensive water conservancy work. In this year, 4.69 million migrant workers were mobilized, and more than 320,000 military workers participated. In terms of river works, earthwork alone reached more than 419 million cubic meters. Most of the more than 42,000 kilometers of dikes across the country have been reinforced, and important hazardous sections have been repaired with dams and dikes. In terms of irrigation, the area of paddy fields has increased by more than 3.71 million mu, and the renovation of old canals and small-scale private projects has benefited more than 13 million mu. The above river defense and irrigation projects have provided an extremely important guarantee for the bumper harvest in most parts of the country in 1950.

    关于水利工作一九五零年的总结和一九五一年的方针与任务
    （一九五一年一月十二日政务院第六十七次政务会议批准）
    甲、一九五零年工作总结
    一九五零年的水利工作是在这样的基础上进行的，即全国河道长期失治，堤防残破不堪，各项基本资料残缺不全，多数河流都没有而且也不可能有完整的治理计划，各级水利机构也不健全，而在一九四九年严重水灾之后，全国人民治水的要求又异常迫切。因此，时间短促，任务繁重，绝大多数只能是一面进行临时性的工程，一面勘测研究。绝大多数河流的治理是设定一定的目标，做有条件有限度的保证。少数河流虽然已经开始带有治本性质的治理，也非一年所能完成。这便是我们一九五○年工作的基本情况。
    一年来的工作，有成绩，也有缺点。
    就河工方面来说，全国完成土工总数，包括新解放区和民修堤防在内，计达四亿一千九百余万立方公尺，其中并有人民解放军三十二万余人积极参加，造成很大的成绩。有了这样巨大的工程，全国四万二千余公里的堤防，绝大部分进行了培修，重要险工地段，并加修了坝埽。一九五零年的多数工程，带有以工代赈的性质，全国动员民工四百六十九万人，连同养活家属，共使灾区人民一千余万人度过了灾荒。由于解放以后，人民政治觉悟的提高，各地平均工作效率，比过去均有提高。工程质量一般都比过去提高，不少地区做到了要求的标准，部分无行夯打硪习惯的地区，也打下了初步基础。在施工的领导方面，部分地区在施工初期发生过错误偏向，造成一定的损失浪费，经过检讨纠正，多数地区都取得并创造了优良的经验。
    就灌溉方面来说，中央投资或贷款举办的工程，共增加灌溉面积三、七一一、四八七亩。另有整修旧渠及民营小型工程，受益一千三百余万亩。其中较大的工程，如陕西洛惠渠过去拖延十八年未能正式放水，一九五零年已有十万亩农田得到灌溉。新疆完成大小灌溉工程，共增加水田面积八十六万亩。在渠道管理方面，多数地区都推翻了过去封建势力把持用水旧规，开始建立民主的管理制度。如陕西各渠由于改进管理办法，较原来灌溉面积扩大二十五万亩。
    就防汛的成效来说，除淮河流域的河南、皖北因雨水过大成灾以外，多数河流和多数地区都能依照保证的标准完成了任务，对保障农产和保护沿河人民生命财产的安全，起了重要的作用。比如黄河，一九五零年的洪水虽然不大，但是经过撤防时期最后一次洪涨，未发生问题。长江中游和珠江流域，苏北新沂河工程，华北潮白河下游整理工程，经过汛期考验，都战胜了一九五零年的洪水，对减轻水灾发生了显著的效用。华东区苏北运河的防汛，承泄淮河巨大的洪水未生溃决。河北省各河虽因河槽狭窄，不能承泄较大的洪水，仍然发生部分溃决，但是由于领导与群众的努力抢救，并及时进行堵口排水，减轻了灾情，增加了种麦面积。其他地区的中小河道，一般皆由堤防加强和人力抢护，避免或减轻了洪水的灾害。
    至于一九五零年淮河的水灾，主要原因是洪水过大，大大超过了现有河道堤防所能容泄及人力抢护所能奏效的限度。而一九三八年蒋匪花园口掘堤以后，经过黄河九年的淤垫，也是造成这一水灾的重要原因。一九四九年水利联席会议时，由于淮河受黄泛的影响，河道地形发生很大的变化，过去的计划已不适用，一时又不可能提出全面的治理计划，所以只临时决定主要堤防以一九三一年洪水位为标准，加以修复，同时进行部分的疏浚。可是一九五零年的洪水，根据实测的纪录和推算的结果，洪水期洪水总量虽不及一九三一年，但因雨量集中和河床淤高，正阳关以上洪峰之高，则尚超过一九三一年。根据实测和推算的结果，假如没有决口，正阳关流量为一三、一五○秒公方，蚌埠为一五、八○○秒公方，而上述两地的河槽容量则不过六、○○○秒公方及八、四○○秒公方，所以洪水漫堤决口以后，正阳关水位仍超过一九三一年最高水位○·六九公尺，蚌埠也超过○·九八公尺。对付这样几十年一遇的特大洪水，在一九四九年水利联席会议时，不可能提出治理的计划，同时就时间人力财力的条件说，半年之内也不可能完成这样巨大的工程。不过在洪水期间，有正阳关以上王截流等处个别堤段，未达保证标准即行溃决，这在主管机关是应该深刻检讨的，不能因为后来的洪水过大，便掩盖了这些错误。
    在水文，测验和规划研究方面，虽然干部不足，但仍进行了许多工作。水文方面，全国增设水文站三六五站，水位站五八九站，水文资料的整理，也在有系统地进行。勘测研究方面，除配合一九五零年的工程设计进行工作以外，并对一些主要河流进行了治本的勘测规划。
    以上是我们一九五零年工作的主要成绩。我们所以能够获得这些成绩，主要的是各地党政机关的领导和全国人民的支持，此外，各有关部门也给了很大的帮助。
    另一方面，我们在领导和工作当中，也还存在一些严重缺点，必须加以克服。
    第一、是工程贪多，没有很好地掌握重点。部分地区存在着百废俱兴的思想，只想到多做工程对人民有好处，却没有想到工程若做不好，将徒然浪费人力物力，反而造成人民的损失。有的计划过大，超过人力物力的可能。有的根据敌伪时代的计划，没有仔细研究修正。有的只进行工作，没有全盘的具体的工程计划。有许多工程，计划粗略，一改再改，如前述的华北潮白河工程及苏北导沂工程，虽然胜利完成，但在施工过程中都造成很大被动。有的工程实际可以缓办（如淮阴船闸惠闸工程）。有的工程，因为技术力量配合不上，计划不完善，或未做计划即行施工，都使工作受到损失。
    第二、调查研究不足，有系统地检查又做得不够，所以也不能及时发现问题，纠正错误。如华北工程局所办永定河泛区龙河南堤的修堤计划，没有照顾梁各庄口门河势的变化，虽然近在咫尺，我们也没有实际检查，没有及时发现和纠正这个计划的缺点，这对于一九五零年永定河泛区决口，也很有影响。其他如个别地区的复堤工程，有的没有详细研究洪水可能有多少来量，河槽有多大容量，以决定治理的具体方针，只就原有堤防加以修复，不晓得能够防御多大的洪水。不论这些河流一九五零年是否曾经发生灾害，以后都需研究改进。
    第三、不精确计算工程效益，造成浪费。许多工程的决定，没有根据工费开支与工程效益的计算比较，甚至夸大有利的条件，忽略可能发生的困难，以致工程浪费。如永定河泛区安次县城北分水道工程，粗略估计可保护并脱出麦田二十余万亩，在隆冬之际以冻土筑堤，结果效益极微，分水道亦于汛期淤平，浪费工粮四十余万斤。又如皖北的正南淮堤，任淮支段下格堤，寿西淮堤等，则都是打算排出湖水，增加耕地，两岸皆水，筑堤于积淤之上，不但招致失败，造成浪费，同时与湖争田，也违反了治河的原则。
    第四、施工前准备不足，施工中组织管理工作不细致，不周密，以致工程遭受损失。这一缺点除少数地区外，各地在开工初期，差不多普遍出现；虽经纠正，但仍有重复发生的事。如华东冬修的时候，皖北泗洪、无为等县住房、食粮、工具、物资均准备不充分，民工上堤后，吃饭不做工，有的因为没有房子住，吃完饭就走，粮食浪费达一百万斤。又如华北潮白河新河道工程，三个专区动员民工时不加检查，来了一些老弱，不能工作，再加民工因雨回家，总共亦有一百万斤米的损失。另外在料物的运输保管和使用方面，也有不少浪费。
    第五、各级工作机构的财务组织不健全，并有个别地区存在着“重工程、轻财粮”，或“完成任务不算账”的思想，不能认真执行预决算制度与专款专用制度，自由挪移工款，致使财务混乱，浪费增多，并助长了各地不报计划、盲目动工的偏向。
    以上便是一九五零年我们工作中的主要缺点。
    乙、一九五一年工作的方针与任务
    一九五一年水利工作，有下列特点：第一、巩固国防成为当前首要任务，服从这个总的方针，水利建设虽与恢复发展农业生产密切相关，但在经费使用方面仍须更大樽节，务使一定的经费，发挥最大的效用。第二、在水利建设方面，因为尚未进行根本的治理，按各河的最大流量和现有防御力量比较，许多主要河流，仍然存在着严重洪水的威胁。在治本研究方面，有的河流有了比较成熟的规划，有的还缺乏合理的规划，需要继续研究。在工作机构方面，虽然已经粗具规模，但是技术干部的数量仍不能配合工作的需要。灌溉事业的发展，亦落后于迫切的需要。有些地区现有的渠道，还没有得到经济的合理的利用。
    根据以上的特点，一九五一年的工作方针，在防洪方面：一般河流，应行重点岁修及严密防汛，要求遇普通洪水不致成灾；洪水威胁较大的河流，应大力加强堤防与护险工事。争取防御较高的洪水；同时，根据需要和技术的可能，有重点地举办主要河流的治本工程。在排水方面：内涝严重地区，应视为重点，大力推进，并提倡与组织群众进行小型排水工程。在灌溉方面：应该是扩充与恢复并重，工程与管理并重，继续完成已经开始的工程，普遍加强渠道管理工作，经济用水，期在现有的基础上扩充灌溉面积，同时选择重点，举办需要最切、效益较著的工程。在治本研究方面：应根据防洪防旱的工程需要，继续进行有系统的准备工作。至于整理河道等项工作，则按经济力量与实际需要，择要举办。
    根据以上方针，一九五一年举办的水利事业的主要项目，分列如下：
    （一）淮河水系
    上游  完成赧王坡等洼地蓄洪及部分操纵工事，配合蓄洪工程，局部整理洪河、汝河、颍河、双洎河及其他河道。并以商邱、陈留、淮阳三专区为重点，举办沟洫工程，在主要支流沟口修建涵闸。山区重点推行水土保持，邱陵区推行塘堰工程，要求一九五一年汛前完成。上游连同洼地自然蓄洪在内，争取达成二十亿公方的蓄洪任务。山谷水库，则着手准备，冬季择要兴工。
    中游  湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，要求完成有效蓄洪量四十亿公方以上。并应配合蓄洪工程，修复堤防，局部退建，以承泄上游洪水来量。凡确保麦秋两收之淮河北岸干堤、颍河东堤、涡河支堤以及蚌埠、淮南矿区圈堤，应以防御最大洪水流量为标准，确保安全。其他堤工，亦应统筹兼顾，按照小利服从大利之原则，分段研究，确定其修复标准。至于河道疏浚，干流应首先疏通正阳关浅段，支流则以濉河、西淝河为重点，并配合举办沟洫工程，首先解决该两支河流域以内麦作时期的排水需要。此外，另应疏浚芡河、天河、东淝河等河口，并对洺、茨、谷等河施?跃植渴杩＃?嘁愿慕?鞲玫厍?笞魇逼诘呐潘??勘辍?
    下游  入海水道须继续研究，充分准备，一九五一年汛后动工。目前，应以加强里运河堤防为重点，根据一九三一年洪水位标准，整修堤坡，加强险工，修理归海坝，疏通入江水道及归海港道障碍。
    以上各项工程完成以后，河南、皖北可以做到小雨无灾，大雨少灾，苏北方面，在三河泄量不超过八、五○○秒公方，江淮不并涨的情况下，里下河地区可保安全。在严重情况万不得已时，仍须开放归海坝，以免运堤决口。
    （二）华北水系
    华北水系最近几年的治理，暂定以永定河、潮白河、大清河为主要施工对象。永定河开始建筑官厅水库，并整理下游河槽。潮白河尽先完成下游整理工程，准备上游水库工程。大清河上游设法蓄水，下游完成独流入海减河。
    一九五一年工程计划：永定河官厅水库，应完成基础钻探工作，同时推进必要的施工准备工作。芦沟桥以下及安次泛区，应适当整理堤防及河槽，以降低下游洪水位并保障铁路安全。潮白河下游整理工程，应继续一九五零年工作，包括黄庄洼以下泄水河道的浚挖等青龙湾河的疏浚，当潮白河洪水不超过三千秒公方时，可以减免潮白、蓟运河沿岸各县洪水灾害，并保障大部地区的麦作。大清河独流入海减河，开始建筑新减河与南运河、子牙河交会地点的船闸节制闸，举办南运河局部改道工程以及减河上口操纵闸的基础工程等，至于全部工程则当在一九五三年汛前完成。
    华北区排水工作也很重要，一九五一年在河北省举办大清河以南地区的排水工事，平原省则疏浚赵王河、洙水河及新乡附近的卫河。以上共可保护农田约三百万亩。一般排水工作依靠地方政府发动群众，自行举办。
    河北省永定、子牙、大清、南运、北运、蓟运等河流的堤防，仍应培修巩固原有的断面，以御普通洪水，对于杨柳青一带子牙、南运两河右岸尤应特予加强，以保障天津市的安全。平原省之南运西堤以及金线岭堤、南阳湖入湖河头堤防，亦须加以整理加强。
    海河上游汛期放淤之津沽水道及大沽沙，应经常浚挖，以保持通海航道，兼助洪水之宣泄。
    华北水系的根治，端赖上游水库与水土保持工作。一九五一年的工程，因限于人力、财力、仍大部属于治标性质，治本工事，不能大量开展；但对于潮白河及大清河上游的水库，仍应推进勘测研究工作，并在永定河大清河流域，试办水土保持工作，以树立治本之基础。
    （三）黄河
    黄河在最近几年以内，仍应加强护岸及堤防工事，勘测和准备潼关孟津间的水库工程，修建支流拦洪拦沙水库，并结合农林计划，积极进行干支流域的水土保持工作。
    一九五一年工作，以整理下游河槽及修护堤防为重点，包括培修大堤、加强护岸、堵支塞串、固滩整险等工事，以宣泄较一九四九年更大洪水为标准。对于潼关、三门峡、王家滩三处水库坝址，进行勘测钻探工作。关于水土保持，应先重点试办泾河流域山溪沟壑的治理。关于引黄灌溉济卫工程，应继续推进，期于一九五三年汛前完成。对于防汛抢险有关的电讯交通设备，应适当加强。上游宁绥地区的灌溉工事，也须积极准备。
    （四）长江
    长江最近几年的治理，侧重于整理并操纵沿江湖泊，以控制江水水位及流量，荆江的防洪工事尤应作为重点。汉水则着重下游水道的整理和上游拦洪水库的修建。
    一九五一年长江干堤及汉水主要堤防，应加适当修护，保证一九四九年同样洪水位不生溃决。荆江大堤尤须视为重点，予以加强。荆江容量不能安全承泄川江最大洪水来量，应测勘研究分洪蓄洪方案，并推进准备工作。汉水碾盘山水库，应完成坝址钻探以及必要的测勘研究工作。大通湖蓄洪垦区一九五零年已大体完成，一九五一年应改进排水道，以利内水宣泄。长江两岸内河与江槽交汇之处及堤内排水沟渠出口，应择要建筑涵闸，以抗江洪内侵，兼利雨水排宣，期能改进五○○万亩农田之生产。下游除防洪防潮工程外，应研究整理河道、保滩护堤等工作。至于上游应研究洪水来源、航道整理及多目标工作条件。宜渝段、嘉陵江合川重庆段以及岷江乐山至宜宾之河槽，均应局部整理，綦江渠化闸坝亦须重点修理，以利蓄泄，并收航运效益。各支流上游，试办小型截流及蓄水工事，以为日后推广水土保持工作的基础。
    （五）珠江
    珠江水系在最近几年以内，应就现有堤围的基础，整理堤系、酌建涵闸、缩短防线、加强干堤，并积极进行基本测验规划工作，准备向中上游发展。
    一九五一年以巩固东江、西江、北江堤防，保证普通洪水位不致成灾为目标。汛期中，应争取有纪录以来最高洪水位不致成灾。粤桂两省境内其他水道，如韩江、鉴江、龙江等亦然。广州附近的陈村沥窖等水道，应重点浚治，以利航行。沿江涵闸，应择要修建，以便操纵排泄。对于治本问题，也应积极加强基本测验工作。
    （六）沂河沭河
    苏北境沂河下游新河道工程已于一九五零年大体完成，一九五一年在山东境内应配合整治，在苏北亦须加强新堤，改进河槽，以期安全宣泄三、二○○秒公方的洪水量。新沂河两岸，应疏浚六塘河、古涟河、泊阳河、五图河等主要排水内河，以解除二六○万亩农田的雨水涝灾。沭河分洪新道工程，应继续一九五零年的工作，但因限于财力，一九五一年只能部分完成引河石工及沙河下游堤防工程，全部完成沭河上游与沙河中游堤防工程，并在既定经费内争取建筑主要涵洞工程，以期一九五二年汛前全部完工。
    （七）华东中南区其他河流及江浙海塘
    华东区各省河流，如福建之闽江、浙江之曹娥江、山东之濉河、小清河、大清河、白浪河、北运河等堤防工事，亦应整修，以御普通洪水。中南区如东荆河、洞庭湖水系，鄱阳湖水系之主要堤防，也应争取一九四九年同样洪水不生溃决。
    苏南、上海市以及浙江之海塘，一九五一年应继续修复并重点加强桩石塘断面和海滩掩护工事，以保障江浙滨海农区。浙江海塘，残破较烈，因钱塘江的潮头影响，海塘设计亦较复杂，应同时着重测勘研究与试验工作，借图根治。
    （八）东北区
    东北区辽河松花江两大水系的治理，最近几年以内，应以辽河水系为主，尤以绕阳河治本工程为重点。并应开始浑河、太子河水库工程。一九五一年绕阳河下游应培修旧堤、完成新堤并建筑闸门。浑河大火房水库，应开始作必要的各项施工准备。治水工程以外，应推进东辽河、查哈阳及盘山农场的灌溉工事。其他工程由各省自行筹款主办。
    （九）内蒙自治区
    内蒙自治区的水利事业，以西辽河水系为重点。一九五一年应在现有基础上重点加强堤防、险工，保证一九四九年最大洪水位大堤不生溃决。为兼顾防洪与灌溉的治本工程，应争取测勘研究上游支流老哈河的石门子水库。此外，松花江水系呼纳盟之雅鲁河、安兴盟之洮儿河等水道之防洪排水淤灌各项工事，可量力择要办理，西辽河西拉木伦河流域以内的防沙保土工作，亦可酌量试办。
    （十）西北及西南区防洪排水工程
    西北区：一九五一年陕西省华县华阴及宁夏河西区，应举办排水工程，并择地试办沟壑治理及陂塘蓄水。
    西南区：云南之南盘江、蟠龙江、西康之安宁河等防洪工程，须酌量举办。
    （十一）贷款举办的灌溉工程
    贷款举办的灌溉工程以西北区为重点。其他区域因地形特殊，或雨量分布不合农业季节，为保障或增加农产，亦应择要举办，计华北区后套黄杨闸及潇河灌溉工程等十处，西北区洛惠渠整修及红雁池水库工程等十六处，华东区柄港扩充灌溉工程等六处，中南区松蒲区灌溉工程等十三处，西南区四联堰整修工程等十三处，全部工程完成以后，一九五一年受益田地初步估计约达四百七十五万七千市亩。
    （十二）测勘水文
    测勘水文试验等基本工作，应配合各河流治理方针以及一九五一年举办工程的需要，组队设站，重点推进。一九五一年首先致力于已有队站的充实调整，并按财力许可酌量扩充。关于组队设站计划，各流域各省区均已有初步方案，尚须按照上述原则及经费的可能，详细考虑再行决定。
    为了实现上述方针计划在工作中必须确实掌握重点。加强规划设计工作，并改进计划审核制度。加强施工中的组织领导，并对民工工资规定统一的制度。健全财务机构，加强财务工作。各级水利机构的领导关系，分工配合，亦应研究改进。
    此外，关于干部培育问题，因为水利工作大量展开，技术干部极端缺乏，一九五一年已订立了培育干部的初步计划，尚须与教育部门配合进行。（附图片）    沂河、沭河：一九五○年根据沂、沭分治方针开辟新沂河道，两岸筑堤八百里。沭河进行了二、三期工程。两河共作土方四千五百余万公方，基本保证了汛期洪水宣泄，减轻了苏北地区历史性灾害。一九五一年继续整理沂河工程并疏浚新沂河沿岸内河，解除二百六十万亩农田的雨水涝灾，沭河四期工程，并已于去年十二月二十五日完工。
  辽河：一九五○年防洪排水共做土方五千四百余公方，保证了一九四九年被淹一千二百余万亩中的八百四十万亩未受水灾。一九五一年着重绕阳河下游培修堤防及闸门修建，西辽河加强堤防等工程。筹备浑河（见12） 、太子河（见13）等水库工程。
  华北水系（包括大清河、子牙河、北运河、潮白河、永定河）：一九五○年主要工程为复堤修险疏浚等，共做土方两千七百余万公方，减少一九四九年被淹面积三千三百余万亩的二分之一。一九五一年整理永定河下游河道继续进行官厅水库（见10）准备工作，大清河开始举办经独流镇入海的减河工程（见11），海河保持通海航道，其他各河培修巩固原有堤防。并加强排水工作。
  黄河：一九五○年主要工程为复堤修险工程，共做土方一千余万公方，石方三十五万公方，汛期组织抢险队三十八万余人，因而战胜了洪水，未生灾害。一九五一年仍以整理下游河槽及堤防修护为重点，并推进引黄灌溉济卫工程（见5），中游进行水库坝址钻探（见6），上游规划宁绥大灌溉区工程
  （见7），并试办陕西泾河山溪（见8）沟壑治理以保持上游水土。
  长江：一九五○年主要工程项目为复堤，大通湖（见1）蓄洪垦殖及遥堤放淤（见2）等工程，共做土方一亿三千余公方，经过汛期洪水考验，基本上未生水灾。一九五一年上游着重整理航道，中游以巩固荆江大堤（见3）为重点，并改进大通湖排水道，推进汉水碾盘山水库（见4）工作，下游则注意防洪防潮，保滩护堤工程。
  潮白河：一九五○年主要工程为新辟下游河道（见9）开挖引河修泄水闸、引河口门等工程，只土工即做一千余万公方，汛期新河道放水，保证了蓟运河流域（见14）内三百万亩农田未受水灾。今年继续下游整理工程，包括浚挖河道、疏浚减河等工程，使潮白河洪水流量不超过三千秒公方时减免潮白、蓟运两河沿岸洪水为灾。淮河：一九五○年工程，以复堤疏浚为主，共做土方八百余万公方，由于去年洪水特大，且蒋匪于一九三八年在花园口决堤后，打乱了淮河水系，致中上游造成严重水灾；下游经大力抢护，保证了苏北里下河地区一千五百余万亩农田的丰收。根据毛主席指示，政务院做了根治淮河的决定。一九五一年本蓄泄兼顾的方针，中上游修建水库蓄水七十余亿公方，并整理河槽。下游巩固运河堤防，增加泄水能量，并筹辟入海水道。今年工程完成后，河南、皖北可以缩小灾害；苏北在三河泄量不超过八千五百秒公方时，保证里下河地区安全。
  总说明：一九五○年是水利工作全面展开的第一个年度，在这一年中，动员了民工四六九万人，并有军工三十二万余人参加，河工方面，只做土工即达四亿一千九百余万立方公尺，全国四万二千余公里的堤防，绝大部分都进行了培修，重要险工地段，并加修了坝埽。在灌溉方面，共增加水田三百七十一万余亩，整修旧渠及民营小型工程受益一千三百余万亩。由于进行了以上河防灌溉工程，对一九五○年全国大部地区的丰收提供了一个极端重要的保证。
  珠江：一九五○年复堤工程，共做土方五百余万公方，保证了围堤所保护的农田四百二十余万亩，未闹水灾。一九五一年以巩固西江、北江、东江堤防为主，保证普遍洪水位不成灾，争取有记录以来最高洪水位不致成灾。
  江浙海塘：一九五○年修补残缺择要加强后，未生水灾。一九五一年继续修复并重点加强保护江浙沿海一带人民的生命财产。
