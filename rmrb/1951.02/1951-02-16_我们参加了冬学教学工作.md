　　We Participated in Winter School Teaching Work
　　Zhang Dianjing
　　The agricultural university is located in the suburbs of Beijing, so the students have more opportunities to interact with farmers. Last winter, we participated in the winter school work.
　　In the beginning, only a small number of students were willing to do this work. Later, after the student union's call and the mobilization of political instructor Comrade Liu Lian, the students all understood that this was a glorious work and reported to participate one after another. Many students from provinces such as Sichuan and Guangdong also participated, even though they did not speak the northern dialect well. We went to the countryside at 5:00 PM every day and did not return to school until 8:00 PM. Regardless of wind or rain, we never interrupted, which moved many villagers. The villagers automatically ran to attend classes every night.
　　The winter schools were distributed over a wide area, and we often had to walk four or five li, and the farthest had to run nine or ten li. Sometimes, when students were sick, they had to ask others to substitute.
　　When winter school first started, the students encountered many difficulties. For example, the students included old and young, and they often laughed and made noise in class, or smoked dry tobacco, or went to warm themselves by the fire, so it was difficult to maintain order, and it was particularly difficult for the teachers to lecture. After the students' explanation and persuasion, everyone understood why they should attend winter school, so they all obeyed the order. Some winter schools also established learning systems, stipulating that talking and smoking were not allowed in class.
　　The students' cultural levels were uneven, which caused us many difficulties in teaching. So we divided the students into classes according to their different levels. When learning the national language, the students often only paid attention to new words and ignored the content of the text. We then extracted some questions from the text and studied them together with them. For example, there was a lesson in the textbook called "Chairman Mao Meets Farmers," and we asked: Why did Chairman Mao meet farmers? Why does Chairman Mao love farmers? The same was true when teaching arithmetic. We tried our best to combine practical problems. Farmers near Lugou Bridge grow a lot of cabbage. When we were teaching multiplication, we came up with the following question: One catty of cabbage costs 200 yuan. If you sell 260 catties of vegetables in a day, how much is your income?
　　When we first approached the farmers, we didn't know how to talk to them. Later, in their spare time, the students often studied crop issues with them and occasionally talked about family matters. As a result, everyone became familiar with each other and established close relationships. They told us how they had been oppressed by the landlords and deceived by the Yiguandao. They took out peanuts and melon seeds for the students to eat; the students helped them make production plans and helped them review the text. When we finished teaching every evening, they were always reluctant to let us return to school.
　　During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the students went to the countryside several times to publicize and help the students rehearse plays, so that they deepened their hatred of American imperialism. When the government banned Yiguandao, the students also seized the time to publicize the policies of the People's Government to everyone. We also told them the stories of revolutionary heroes and taught them to sing and do the yangko dance. The students sometimes raised some political questions and asked us to explain them.
　　During the Spring Festival, the winter schools in each village held examinations, and the results were very good. Learning models were selected, and a get-together was held in the first part of Agricultural University at 8:00 PM on the 8th of this month, and the model students were rewarded on the spot. They assured everyone that they would continue to work hard in the future and never fall behind!

　　我们参加了冬学教学工作
    张殿京
    农业大学的校址设在北京的郊外，同学们和农民的接触机会比较多。去年冬天，我们参加了冬学工作。
    开始时，只有小部分同学愿意做这个工作，后来，经过了学生会的号召和政治教员刘炼同志的动员，同学们都明白了这是一件光荣的工作，纷纷报告参加。很多来自四川、广东等省的同学，虽然北方话说得不好，也参加了。我们每天下午五点钟下乡，一直到八时才回校，无论刮风下雨，从未间断过，感动了许多老乡。老乡们每天晚上都自动地跑来上课。
    冬学分布的地区很广，我们往往要走四、五里路，最远的要跑九、十里路。有时，同学们病了，也要请别人去代课。
    冬学刚开始时，同学们曾遇到了很多的困难。如学员中有老的少的，上课时常常笑闹，或者抽旱烟，或者去烤火，因而秩序很难维持，教员讲课时就特别费力。经过同学们的解释和劝导，大家明白了为什么要上冬学，于是都遵守了秩序。有的冬学还订立了学习制度，规定上课时不许谈话，不许抽烟。
    学员的文化程度是高低不齐的，使我们在教学时遇到了不少的困难。我们于是根据学员们的不同程度分了班。而在学习国语时，学员们往往只注意生字，忽视课文的内容。我们便从课文中找出一些问题，和他们共同研究。例如课本中有一课“毛主席接见农民”，我们便问：为什么毛主席要接见农民？为什么毛主席爱农民？上算术课时也是如此，我们尽可能的结合了实际问题。芦沟桥附近的农民多种白菜，我们在讲乘法时便出了这样的题目：一斤白菜是二百元，你一天卖了二百六十斤菜，收入多少？
    我们在最初接近农民时，都不知道如何和他们谈话。后来，同学们在闲暇时，常常和他们在一起研究作物问题，偶而谈些家常。于是，大家都熟悉了，相互间建立起亲密的感情。他们就告诉我们，以前如何受地主的压迫，如何受一贯道的欺骗。他们拿出花生、瓜子给同学们吃；同学们则帮助他们订生产计划，帮助他们复习课文。当我们每天晚间教完课时，他们总是恋恋不舍地不让我们回校。
    在抗美援朝运动中，同学们曾数次下乡宣传，帮助学员们排剧，使他们加深了对美帝的仇恨。政府取缔一贯道时，同学们也抓紧时间向大家宣传了人民政府的政策。我们也给他们讲革命英雄的事迹，教他们唱歌、扭秧歌。学员们有时也提出一些政治上的问题，要求我们解释。
    在春节时，各村的冬学都举行了考试，成绩很好。并选出学习模范，于本月八日晚八时在农大大一部举行了一个联欢会，当场奖励了模范学员。他们向大家保证，以后要继续努力，永不掉队！
