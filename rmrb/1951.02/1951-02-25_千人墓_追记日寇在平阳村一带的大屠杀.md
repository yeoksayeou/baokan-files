　　The Thousand-Person Tomb
    ——Remembering the Massacre by Japanese Invaders in the Pingyang Village Area
    Han Ying
    In August of the lunar calendar in 1943, just as crops were about to ripen, the Japanese invaders entrenched in North China launched a three-month-long autumn "mopping-up" operation against the anti-Japanese base area of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. Fuping County was the heart of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region; Pingyang Village was one of the killing fields of this Japanese "mopping-up" operation. Under the direct command of the murderous demon Arai, five thousand Japanese invaders committed a horrifying massacre here.

    Pingyang Village is located east of Fuping City, with the Pingyang River winding through the east of the village, fertile fields, and surrounding forests. The streets within the village were wide and level, with numerous shops, making it a large market town in Fuping. At that time, Pingyang Village was the economic center of the surrounding villages.

    On August 21st of the lunar calendar, the Japanese invaders began their invasion of the Pingyang Village area. The enemy's plan was a two-pronged attack to completely destroy the people and property in this area. In advance, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the local people carried out a scorched earth policy. On the 23rd, the enemy concentrated three hundred people to search the South Mountain of Pingyang. They surrounded a four-li-long mountain gully, gathered sixty-two farmers in the gully, set up machine guns around them, forced them down the mountain, and locked them together. The next day, over a thousand enemies jointly attacked Deer Camel Mountain, capturing forty-five people. Yang Zhen’s entire family of three, big and small, was killed on the spot. Yang Zhen’s wife’s head was smashed with stones by the Japanese invaders. Zhang Xiaoduo, Yang Zhen's niece, was picked up by the Japanese invaders and thrown from the top of the mountain to her death. Zhang Weisheng's sister-in-law resisted rape and was disemboweled by the enemy; her five-month-old fetus flowed to the ground along with her intestines. On the same day, another group of enemies scurried to Yangshu Gully, where they slowly sliced to death Meng Lianshu's sixty-five-year-old mother and threw her body into the fire. Bai Diange's wife was disemboweled and died, and her one-year-old infant crawled on her mother's body looking for milk, becoming covered in blood.

    The enemy's burning and killing became increasingly cruel. During the raid on Hanjiayu, they bloodily washed over ten villages including Gelao and Beishuiyu along the way. An old farmer, Li Hai, who was hiding in the reeds, was buried alive in the ground; Li Qinglin was half-decapitated and thrown into the water. In Pingyang Village, twenty-one young people were taken to the roof and killed, and blood flowed from the eaves' waterways filling the courtyard. Li Xiaogeng from Tumen Village, refusing to lead the enemy, had his heart and liver dug out, fried in oil, and eaten. ...

    The Japanese invaders' brutal humiliation of women was even more unheard of. Of the two hundred and fifty women captured in Shantouzui Village, three were raped and then lured to the top of the mountain, pushed off the high cliff, and fell to their deaths. A twelve-year-old girl was gang-raped by seven soldiers. Sixteen women and children captured in the Laotouz Wo and Xiaoshimen areas were driven into earthen caves by the Japanese invaders and smoked to death alive with fire. The enemy threw a pregnant young woman into a coffin, cut open the flesh on her chest with a knife, tore open her abdomen, took out her heart, and picked out the fetus, with blood flowing all over the bottom of the coffin. While carrying out this inhuman massacre, the Japanese invaders forced more than twenty naked women to "observe." During the "mopping-up" operation, many of the captured women suffered the enemy's ravages.

    However, the unarmed people did not succumb to the Japanese invaders' lasciviousness! After being captured, Han Xiaogeng, a shepherd in Shantouzui Village, was interrogated by the enemy, who attempted to find out the whereabouts of our army and the fortified property. Han Xiaogeng cursed them vehemently. As the enemy was about to stab him to death, he suddenly turned around and picked up a stone, hitting an enemy in the head, and the enemy's corpse rolled down the hillside. After Liu Yaomei, the director of the Women's Salvation Association of Luoyu Village, was captured, she remained steadfast and unyielding. The enemy repeatedly threatened and enticed her, but still could not get any secrets from her. In the end, she died heroically.

    After the November "mopping-up" operation ended, more than four hundred and sixty corpses were left in the five killing fields of Pingyang Village; more than three hundred bodies were left in the streets; more than twenty female corpses lay horizontally in a courtyard in the village, their heads thrown aside, in chaos; nearly a hundred corpses were in the seventeen sweet potato cellars north of the village, most of whom were women without clothes; a row of thirty-six bodies were on the field east of the village. The blood of the dead stained the streets and walls red. The once prosperous town became a desolate and miserable scene.

    In this "mopping-up" operation, the people in the Pingyang Village area directly killed by the enemy numbered seven hundred and fifty-two, eighty-nine died from torture, and one hundred and twelve were taken away. Including the more than two hundred people killed in Jiajiakou, a total of more than one thousand one hundred people were sacrificed. More than five thousand two hundred houses were burned. More than one hundred and eighty thousand catties of grain, more than one thousand two hundred livestock, and more than four thousand pieces of clothing were looted....

    In order to commemorate the people who sacrificed in this "mopping-up" operation, to let their descendants forever remember the blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders, and to avenge them, the local people established the "Thousand-Person Tomb." A stone stele stands in front of the "Thousand-Person Tomb," with the following inscription:

    "In the autumn of 1943, the Japanese invaders gathered an army of forty thousand, lasting three months, to carry out an extermination mopping-up operation against our North Yue District. Fuping was the center of the mopping-up operation, and the Pingyang area was the focus of the struggle. The enemy's Arai unit was an extremely evil group of beasts, ripping open the wombs of pregnant women and feasting on the flesh of living people, creating the world-shocking Pingyang massacre, slaughtering more than seven hundred of our compatriots."

    The blood and tears of the people in the Pingyang Village area have just been wiped away, the tragic history of the "Thousand-Person Tomb" is still fresh in people's memories, and today, American imperialism is rearming Japanese fascism. We must demand repayment of our blood debt from American imperialism! (Attached picture)

    After being captured, Liu Yaomei, the director of the Women's Salvation Association of Luoyu Village, Fuping County, resolutely refused to be raped by the Japanese invaders and was brutally dismembered. The horrific state of her head being cut off and a large piece of flesh being gouged out of her leg.

　　千人墓
    ——追记日寇在平阳村一带的大屠杀
    韩英
    一九四三年夏历八月，正是庄稼将熟的季节。盘踞在华北的日寇，用兵四万，对晋察冀边区抗日根据地开始了长达三个月的秋季“大扫荡”。阜平县是晋察冀边区的腹地；平阳村就是这次日寇“大扫荡”的杀人场之一。在杀人魔王荒井的直接指挥下的五千日寇，在这里制造了惨绝人寰的大血案。
    平阳村位于阜平城东，平阳河自村东蜿蜒流过，肥田沃土，林木环布。村内街道平宽，商店林立，为阜平一大集镇。当时，平阳村是附近各村人民的经济生活中心。
    夏历八月二十一日，日寇开始了向平阳村一带的进犯。敌人的计划是两路合击，彻底毁灭这一带的人民和财物。事先，当地人民在共产党领导下，进行了空室清野。二十三日，敌人集中了三百人搜索平阳南山，他们包围了四里长的一条山沟，把沟里的六十二名农民赶在一起，四周架起机枪，逼下山来，锁在一起。次日，敌人千余合击鹿驼山，捉住了四十五人。当场杀死了杨祯家的大小三口。杨祯的妻子被日寇用石头将脑袋砸烂。杨祯的外甥女张小多，被日寇抱起从山顶投到山下摔死。张卫生的弟媳，抗拒强奸，被敌人剥开了肚皮死去；五个月的胎儿也随着母亲的肚肠流到地上。就在这同一天，另股敌人窜到杨树沟，用刀将孟连书的六十五岁的老母零刮致死，又将其尸体投进火里。白殿阁的妻子被剖腹死后，她的周岁婴儿在母亲身上爬来爬去找奶吃，滚得满身是血。
    敌人的烧杀愈来愈残酷。在奔袭韩家峪时，沿途血洗了葛老、北水峪等十村。藏在苇地里的老农民李海，被活埋在地里；李青林被割掉了半个脖子之后扔到水里。在平阳村，二十一个青年被架到房顶杀死，鲜血从房檐的水道流满了院子。土门村的李小更，宁死不给敌人带路，敌人把他的心肝挖出，油炒了吃掉。……
    日寇对妇女的残暴污辱，更是闻所未闻。山头嘴村被捕的二百五十名妇女，其中三人被奸污后，又诱至山顶，推下高崖摔死。一个十二岁的女孩子，被七个兽兵轮奸。在老头子窝、小石门一带被捕的十六名妇女、儿童，曾被日寇赶进土洞，用烟火活活熏死。敌人把一个怀孕的少妇，扔进棺材里，用刀剥开她胸前的皮肉，撕开膛，摘出心，挑出了胎儿，血流满了棺材底。日寇在进行这一毫无人性的惨杀时，并强迫二十多个裸体妇女来“参观”。在“扫荡”中，凡被捕的妇女，很多人都遭受了敌人的蹂躏。
    但是，徒手的人民也并没有屈服在日寇的淫威之下！山头嘴村放羊工人韩小更被捕后，敌人企图从他身上探听出我军的下落及坚壁的财物。韩小更破口大骂。敌人正要将他刺死，他猛一转身顺手拣起一块石头，打中了一个敌人的头颅，敌人的死尸滚下山坡。罗峪村妇救会主任刘耀梅被捕后，坚贞不屈，敌人再三威胁利诱，仍然没有从她口里得到丝毫秘密。最后她壮烈牺牲。
    十一月“大扫荡”结束后，平阳村的五个杀人场上遗留着四百六十多具死尸；街里丢着三百多具；村内一个院子里横躺着二十多具女尸，她们的头都抛在一边，混乱了；村北十七个红薯窖里有尸近百具，其中妇女都没有穿衣服；村东场上一排三十六具。死者的鲜血染红了街道，染红了墙壁。往日繁荣的镇市变成了一片荒凉凄惨景象。
    在这次“扫荡”中，平阳村一带人民被敌直接杀死者达七百五十二人，酷刑致死者八十九人，抓走一百一十二人，连同贾家口被杀死的二百多人，此次共牺牲一千一百余人。被烧房屋五千二百余间。被抢走粮食十八万余斤，牲口一千二百余头、衣物四千余件……。
    当地人民为了纪念在这次“扫荡”中牺牲的人民，为了让子孙们永远记住日寇欠下的这笔血债，并为他们复仇，公立了“千人墓”。“千人墓”前立有石碑，碑文如下：
    “一九四三年秋，日寇集兵四万，历时三月，对我北岳区进行剿灭扫荡。阜平为扫荡之中心，平阳一带为斗争之焦点。敌人荒井部队为极恶兽兵，破孕妇之腹，餐生人之肉，造成举世骇闻之平阳惨案，屠杀我同胞达七百余名。”
    平阳村一带人民的血迹眼泪刚刚擦干，“千人墓”的惨史人们记忆犹新，今日，美帝又在武装日本法西斯，我们的血债，要向美帝讨还！（附图片）
    阜平县罗峪村妇救会主任刘耀梅被俘后，严拒日寇奸污，惨遭碎尸。她的头被砍断，腿上的肉被剜去一大块之惨状。
