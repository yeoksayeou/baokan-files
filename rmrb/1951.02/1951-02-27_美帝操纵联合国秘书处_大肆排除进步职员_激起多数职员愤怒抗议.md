　　Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: According to a TASS dispatch: The United Nations Secretariat, under the control of the U.S. State Department, is massively dismissing staff members with progressive ideas in order to turn the Secretariat into a purely American organ.

　　These measures, which violate the United Nations Charter, have aroused indignation and protest from the majority of staff. Recently, seventy staff members have been dismissed from the United Nations Secretariat. Three leaders of the "United Nations Staff Association," an organization of Secretariat employees, who actively resisted the reactionary policies of the United Nations bureaucracy, have also been dismissed.

　　The "United Nations Staff Association," representing three thousand five hundred staff members of various nationalities in the Secretariat, has therefore passed a resolution demanding that Lie immediately reinstate the seventy dismissed staff members. The Association also accused him of dismissing three progressive leaders of the Association. In addition, nine hundred Secretariat staff members held a protest meeting against the unfair dismissals and the actions of Lie and other American lackeys in intimidating Secretariat staff.

    【新华社二十六日讯】综合塔斯社讯：在美国国务院控制下的联合国秘书处，正大肆排除具有进步思想的职员，以便把秘书处变为纯粹的美国机关。
    这些违反联合国宪章的措施，已激起了多数职员的愤慨与抗议。最近以来，联合国秘书处有七十名职员被解职。秘书处职员组织的“联合国职员协会”中的三位积极抗拒联合国官僚的反动政策的领袖，也被解职。
    代表秘书处三千五百名各种国籍职员的“联合国职员协会”，为此已通过一项决议，要求赖伊立即将七十名解职的职员复职。该协会并指责他将协会中三位进步领袖解职的措施。此外，九百名秘书处职员曾举行抗议大会，反对这种不公正的解职以及赖伊等美国奴仆恫吓秘书处职员的举动。
