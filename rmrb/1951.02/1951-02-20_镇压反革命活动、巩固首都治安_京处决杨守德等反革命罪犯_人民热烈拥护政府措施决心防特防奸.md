　　Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities, Consolidate Capital Security
    Beijing Executes Counter-Revolutionary Criminals Including Yang Shoude
    People Enthusiastically Support Government Measures, Determined to Prevent Spies and Traitors

    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities and consolidate the security of the capital, the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission sentenced 27 die-hard Kuomintang secret agents and 31 ringleaders of reactionary secret societies such as Yiguandao to death on the 18th of this month, and executed them by firing squad on the same day.

    The executed counter-revolutionary criminals were all Kuomintang secret agents guilty of heinous crimes. Some infiltrated the capital to establish counter-revolutionary secret service organizations in an attempt to subvert the People's Government; some refused to register, concealed firearms, and continued to lie dormant to carry out sabotage activities; some were key Kuomintang secret agents who had consistently massacred the people; and some were bandits who had betrayed the revolution and actively engaged in anti-people activities. Among them, the bandit Yang Shoude, in July 1949, accepted an appointment from the Kuomintang "Ministry of National Defense" in Guangzhou, serving as the Kuomintang "Commander of the Ji-Re-Cha Border Region Advance Column and Director of the Administrative Office." Colluding with bandits Tang Boyin and Liu Ruohui, he carried a radio station and a large amount of operating expenses, infiltrating the capital in 1949 to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. He also developed secret service organizations in Hengyang, Changsha, Beijing, and other places, attempting to establish fake township and town governments, organize armed bandits, and plot riots. Kuomintang secret agents Fu Shuping and Su Menghua were dispatched by the Kuomintang "Ministry of National Defense" and infiltrated Beijing in January of this year, attempting to steal intelligence. Xie Juecheng, a key Kuomintang secret agent, had long served as an executioner who massacred the people after joining the Kuomintang secret service organization in 1932. In 1936, the bandit personally led secret agents to assist the Kuomintang ringleader Dai Li in detaining General Yang Hucheng and his wife. After the liberation of Shanghai, the bandit refused to register and infiltrated Beijing to continue carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. The traitor and secret agent Li Yongming relied on the power of the Japanese invaders in 1944 and personally killed five of our army's cadres and civilians.

    The executed ringleaders of reactionary secret societies included the heads of reactionary organizations such as Yiguandao, Jiugongdao, Zhengzidao, and Mingdaohui. They were all counter-revolutionary criminals who had colluded with the enemy and puppets, killed revolutionary cadres, oppressed the masses, and raped women during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, committing numerous crimes. After liberation, these criminals remained unrepentant and continued to engage in activities against the people, spreading rumors, sabotaging land reform, resisting government decrees, plotting to preserve reactionary organizations, waiting for an opportunity to stir up trouble, and preventing followers from confessing and registering with the government. Among them, the four bandits Wang Weizhong, Wang Xunchen, Wang Weishan, and Mi Guoquan were known as the "Three Wangs and One Mi" in Yiguandao. In the past, they specialized in colluding with major traitors and secret agents such as Wang Yitang and Ma Hansan to do evil and harm the people. They, along with criminals Hou Shantian and Chen Mingyuan, were so-called "Eight Representatives" of Yiguandao. Others, such as Ren Yantang, were also close confidants of Zhang Wufu, the chief of Yiguandao in Beijing.

    These die-hard counter-revolutionary criminals who were resolutely hostile to the people were sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission in accordance with the facts of their crimes and at the strong request of the broad masses of the people in Beijing.

    [Reported by this newspaper] On the 18th of this month, the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission executed 58 Kuomintang secret agents and ringleaders of reactionary secret societies who were guilty of heinous crimes, which was enthusiastically supported by the broad masses.

    Workers, peasants, students, and ordinary citizens in Beijing unanimously believed that the government did well and did the right thing. Only by severely suppressing these counter-revolutionary elements can the people live a good life. Hu Guangzheng, a worker at the Lanxinzai store, said: "Now is the time for resisting America and aiding Korea, and for preventing spies and traitors. Killing these guys is good for us!" Guo Wenxuan, a farmer in Dongyingfang in the northern suburbs, said: "Those who should be lenient should be treated with leniency, and those who should be suppressed should be suppressed. It is not enough to be lenient. The People's Government must execute people like them!" Zhao Shoutian, a farmer, said: "The Yiguandao leaders who were shot used to deceive people and spread rumors. Today, they are shot, so that the counter-revolutionaries also know that the People's Government is not afraid to kill people!" Li Shiming, a poor resident of No. 9, Southwest Avenue, Nanyuan, said: "This is a truly People's Government! The people demanded that Liu Yuying, a Yiguandao 'point master,' be executed in Nanyuan, and he was really shot. This is really satisfying! It also vented the anger of the deceived followers!" Ma Shixi, a senior three student at the Affiliated High School of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "Some secret agents were released in the past, but they did not know how to repent, so I felt that the People's Government was too lenient. Now it is right to shoot them."

    This wise measure by the government aroused even greater hatred among people from all walks of life towards Kuomintang secret agents and ringleaders of reactionary secret societies, and they have been actively denouncing their crimes. Wang Shichang of Qiliji Village said: "I heard that the secret agent Li Yongming was shot, so I made a special trip to see it. Many people in our village have been harmed by him. I will definitely report to the village head when I go back and publicize it to the masses. Today's government really eliminated a scourge for the people." Workers at the Qinghe Woolen Mill said: "The number of people killed by the traitor and secret agent Li Yongming is no less than a hundred. During the Japanese occupation, he was a secret agent of the '1418' unit, nicknamed 'King of Hell.' The Kuomintang arrested him and then released him. Only the Communist Party truly eliminates harm for the people!" Yin Luozhi, an employee of the Photographic Industry Association of the Eighth District, said: "I have visited the exhibition of Yiguandao crimes in Zhongshan Park. Its crimes are all displayed there, which is really hateful. Today, the People's Government has shot all the Yiguandao leaders who committed heinous crimes, which is really satisfying!"

    After the execution of these counter-revolutionary criminals, the vigilance of the masses has been raised, and they have proposed to assist the government in preventing spies and traitors. A group of workers at Beijing Railway Station and workers at the Zhonghua Restaurant all said: "In the future, our workers should assist the government in eliminating these anti-people guys." Among the 27 secret agents who were shot, Han Fengcai and Zhang Nian, two secret agents, had hidden in the Yipinxian Bathhouse to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. More than 50 workers at the bathhouse were very angry when they saw these scoundrels appear in the cloakroom. They said: "These bastards are simply trying to smash our rice bowls." They held a special discussion meeting on the evening of the 19th to discuss how to raise vigilance and prevent spies and traitors. (Attached pictures)

　　镇压反革命活动、巩固首都治安
    京处决杨守德等反革命罪犯   
    人民热烈拥护政府措施决心防特防奸
    【本报讯】北京市军事管制委员会军法处为严厉镇压反革命活动，巩固首都治安，于本月十八日将怙恶不悛的蒋匪特务二十七名及一贯道等反动会道门首恶三十一名判处死刑，并于当日执行枪决。
    伏法的反革命罪犯均系罪恶重大的蒋匪特务，有的潜入首都，建立反革命特务组织，企图颠覆人民政府；有的拒不登记，隐匿枪枝，继续潜伏进行破坏活动；有的系一贯屠杀人民的蒋匪首要特务分子；有的系叛变革命，积极从事反人民活动的匪徒。其中如匪犯杨守德，于一九四九年七月，在广州接受匪“国防部”任命，充匪“冀热察边区挺进纵队司令兼行署主任”，勾结匪徒唐伯寅、刘若蕙携带电台及大量活动经费，于一九四九年潜入首都，进行反革命活动，并曾在衡阳、长沙、北京等地发展特务组织，妄图建立伪乡、镇政权，组织武装匪徒，阴谋暴乱。“军统”特务傅叔平、苏梦华受匪“国防部”派遣，于今年一月潜来北京，企图窃取情报。“军统”首要特务谢厥成，自一九三二年参加匪“军统”特务组织后，长期充当屠杀人民的刽子手。一九三六年，该匪亲率特务，协助匪首戴笠扣押杨虎城将军及其夫人。上海解放后，该匪拒不登记，潜来北京继续进行反革命活动。汉奸、特务李永明于一九四四年凭借日寇势力，先后亲手杀害我军干部和群众五人。
    伏法的反动会道门首恶，包括反动的一贯道、九宫道、正字道、明道会等反动会门头子，均系在日寇、国民党统治期间，与敌伪勾结作恶，杀害革命工作干部，欺压群众，强奸妇女，罪行累累的反革命罪犯。解放后，该犯等仍怙恶不悛，继续进行反对人民的活动，散布谣言，破坏土地改革，抗拒政府法令，阴谋保存反动组织，伺机蠢动，并阻止道徒向政府坦白登记。其中如王维忠、王勋臣、王维山和米国权四匪在一贯道中称“三王一米”，过去专门勾结大汉奸和特务分子王揖唐、马汉三之流，为非作恶，残害人民，并与侯善田、陈明源等犯同为一贯道的所谓“八大代表”。其他如任延堂等也都是北京一贯道首恶张五福的亲信爪牙。
    这些怙恶不悛，坚决与人民为敌的反革命罪犯，在京市广大人民纷纷控诉下，已为北京市军事管制委员会军法处根据该犯等犯罪事实，依法处以极刑。（柯夫）
    【本报讯】本月十八日，北京市军事管制委员会军法处枪决五十八名罪大恶极的蒋匪特务和反动会道门头子后，获得广大群众的热烈拥护。
    北京的工人、农民、学生及一般市民，一致认为政府这样做得好，做得对，这些反革命分子只有予以严厉镇压，人民才能过好日子。兰馨斋店员工人扈光政说：“现在正是抗美援朝，防奸防特的时候，把这些家伙毙了才对我们有利！”北郊东营房农民郭文轩说：“该宽大的就宽大，该镇压的就镇压，光宽大也不行，人民政府对他们这样的就得崩！”农民赵寿田说：“枪毙的一贯道头子过去净骗人、造谣，今天枪毙了，让反革命也知道人民政府不是不敢毙人！”南苑西南大道九号贫民李世明说：“这才是名符其实的人民政府呢！人民要求把一贯道点传师刘毓英拉到南苑枪毙，就真枪毙了，这才大快人心哪！也给受骗道徒们出了气啦！”辅仁大学附中高三学生马世习说：“过去有的特务被释放，但他们并不知悔改，所以我感到人民政府太宽大，现在枪毙真应该。”
    政府这一英明措施，更激起了各界人民对蒋匪特务和反动会道门头子的无限愤恨，纷纷控诉他们的罪行。七里集村王世昌说：“我听见枪毙了特务李永明，我特意跑来看看，过去我们村里的人受他害的很多，我回去一定向村长报告，向群众宣传，今天的政府真给人民除了害。”清河制呢厂工人们说：“汉奸、特务李永明杀害的人命，不下百人，在日本时，他是‘一四一八’部队的特务，外号叫‘阎王爷’，国民党抓住他又放了，只有共产党才真给人民除害！”八区照像业同业公会职员殷骆之说：“我参观过中山公园的一贯道罪证展览，它的罪恶都摆在那里，真是可恨，今天人民政府把一贯道罪大恶极的头子都枪毙了，真是痛快！”
    枪毙了这些反革命罪犯之后，提高了群众的警惕，他们纷纷提出要协助政府防奸防特。北京车站一群工人和中华饭店的工人都说：“以后我们工人应该协助政府，肃清这些反人民的家伙。”枪毙的二十七个特务里，韩凤才和张年两个特务曾在一品香澡堂里隐蔽，进行反革命活动。该处五十多个工人看见柜上出了这些败类，都非常气愤。他们说：“这些小子简直要砸咱们的饭碗。”他们在十九日晚特别举行了座谈会，讨论如何提高警惕，防奸防特。（附图片）
