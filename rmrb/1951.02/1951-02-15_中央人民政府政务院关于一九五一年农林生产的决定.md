　　Central People's Government Administration Council
　  Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951
    (Adopted at the 70th Political Affairs Meeting of the Government Administration Council on February 2, 1951)
            (1)
    The agricultural and forestry production increase plan for 1950 has been victoriously completed. National grain production increased by 10.8 percent compared to 1949, cotton production increased by 58.9 percent, and other special products and livestock also saw significant increases. In 1951, it is necessary to increase grain production even further and provide a more sufficient supply of industrial raw materials. It is required to increase national grain production by 7.1 percent on the basis of 1950; increase cotton production by 36.9 percent; increase jute for sack production by 69.1 percent; increase flue-cured tobacco leaf production by 324.8 percent; increase black tea and green brick tea production by 35.1 percent; increase domestic silkworm cocoon production by 14.9 percent; increase tussah silkworm cocoon production by 56.8 percent; increase oilseed production by 9.7 percent; increase sugar crop production by 29.1 percent; increase aquatic product production by 20.8 percent; afforest 2.2 million mu; cultivate 56,000 mu of tree seedlings; and close hillsides for afforestation on 8 million mu. Other draft animals, livestock, special products, and sideline occupations should be developed as much as possible according to local conditions.

    In order to better complete the agricultural and forestry production increase plan for 1951, in addition to requiring all localities to pay attention to the seasons and not violate agricultural timing in production work, different requirements should be put forward for different regions. That is, in the old liberated areas that have completed land reform, except for disaster areas and areas with severe war damage, production is generally required to exceed pre-war levels, to organize, improve technology, and promote household, village, and mutual aid group plans with emphasis, and to carry out appraisal and bumper harvest campaigns. In areas where land reform was implemented last winter and this spring, production is required to approach pre-war levels. In areas where only rent reduction has been implemented and land reform has not yet been implemented, production is required to exceed the level of 1950. In mountainous areas, it is necessary to establish the long-term construction view of "relying on the mountains for sustenance," protect and cultivate mountains and forests, consolidate mountain gullies, build terraced fields, and develop sideline production, so that impoverished mountainous areas gradually move towards prosperity. In areas suffering from floods and droughts, continue to implement the policy of self-reliance through production, and effectively help disaster victims solve difficulties in production.
            (2)
    To ensure the victorious completion of the agricultural and forestry production increase in 1951, governments at all levels must implement the following agricultural and forestry production policies.

    1. In the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, resolutely protect the land property that the people have obtained from infringement. In the newly liberated areas, immediately determine land ownership and issue land certificates after land reform is completed. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out and only rent reduction has been implemented, resolutely protect the right of whoever cultivates to harvest and the tenant farming rights of farmers.

    2. Implement a rational burden of agricultural tax policy. Those who exceed the normal annual yield due to good management, diligent cultivation, and improved technology will not have their public grain burden increased for the exceeding portion; those whose yield is less than the normal annual yield due to negligent cultivation will not have their public grain reduced. Those whose yield significantly exceeds the general production level of the local area and is recognized by the public through democratic appraisal, the People's Government may give material or honorary rewards to launch mass labor model movements and mass production competitions. All cadres who have made significant achievements in leading production should also be rewarded. Transform landlords who do not engage in production and lazy good-for-nothings. Landlords and old-style rich peasants in the old liberated areas who obey government decrees and work diligently after land reform, landlords for five consecutive years and rich peasants for three consecutive years or more, may have their class status changed with the approval of the county people's government through the village people's congress.

    3. Labor mutual aid groups should receive various rewards and preferential treatment from the People's Government—they should enjoy the priority of national loans, technical guidance, improved varieties, agricultural machinery, and new agricultural implements, as well as the priority of national trade agencies in marketing agricultural and sideline products and supplying means of production. Temporary hiring of short-term labor among farmers can be encouraged. The existence of the rich peasant economy and the freedom to hire labor are allowed.

    4. Implement a price policy that rewards the production of major industrial raw material crops, ensuring a reasonable ratio of cotton to grain, tobacco to grain, and hemp to grain, and guaranteeing procurement and marketing. Implement superior quality, superior price, low quality, low price, and fair and reasonable pricing according to grade, and prohibit suppressing grades for procurement. Promote contract systems and advance purchase and credit purchase methods for agricultural products. Agricultural burdens of cotton and tobacco farmers can be collected once in the autumn, and public grain can be paid with cotton and tobacco.

    5. Implement mountain and forest management. Strictly prohibit burning mountains and indiscriminate felling, delineate firewood and grazing areas, launch tree planting and fruit planting, and promote cooperative afforestation. In order to maintain water and soil, digging up tree roots and grass roots should also be prohibited in different regions. The People's Government should give material or honorary rewards to those who have made significant achievements in protecting and cultivating mountains and forests and planting trees. Public barren mountains and wasteland should be encouraged for mass contracting for afforestation. After afforestation, forest rights belong to the afforestation.

    6. Reward the construction of water conservancy projects. For increased production due to the construction of water conservancy projects, the portion of increased production due to mass self-funded cooperation will not have its normal annual yield revised or public grain burden increased for five years. The portion of increased production due to state-funded construction will not have its normal annual yield revised or public grain burden increased for three years. Reclaiming raw wasteland is exempt from public grain for three to five years, but opening mountain wasteland and steep slopes is absolutely prohibited. Already opened mountain wasteland must be built into terraced fields. It should be repeatedly explained to cadres and the masses that opening mountain wasteland and steep slopes is harmful to everyone. "Opening wasteland in the mountains, disaster in the plains," cannot be promoted.

    7. Protect the interests of livestock raisers. Reward livestock breeding, improve the social status of breeding livestock households, and provide support. Launch a livestock epidemic prevention campaign and promote livestock insurance.

    8. Encourage farmers to invest in expanding reproduction. Promote mutual aid savings clubs and credit cooperatives. Promote free lending, which must be borrowed and repaid. Appropriately use state investment and loans. The People's Government should provide convenience and guarantees for private investment in developing agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and private lending to help farmers develop production.

    9. In some closed areas where grain production is large but cannot be transported for sale (such as northern Shaanxi and certain provinces in the southwest), in addition to promoting the planting of crops such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp according to local conditions and planning, under the conditions that they can be transported for sale, raising pigs, cattle, and horses and distilling alcohol with government approval should also be promoted so that farmers can obtain the price of increased grain production.

    10. Strictly prohibit all sabotage activities by landlords, secret agents, and reactionary societies. If there is unwarranted abandonment of land, slaughtering of draft animals, destruction of agricultural implements, felling of trees, or demolition of buildings, the People's Government should severely punish them.
            (3)
    Based on the experience of leading agricultural and forestry production in 1950, the following points are put forward for agricultural and forestry production in 1951, and it is hoped that governments at all levels will pay attention to them.

    It is necessary to continue to implement the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao that "organizing is the only way to change from poor to rich." Oppose the view of some people who believe that "organizing is only a way to solve the shortage of labor; in the case of a surplus of labor, people can independently produce and become rich, and labor mutual aid groups should dissolve themselves." On the contrary, labor mutual aid can not only overcome the difficulty of labor shortage, but also further achieve the purpose of improving production. Voluntary combination, equivalent exchange, and democratic management are the fundamental principles of organizing and must be observed. It is necessary to combine with improving technology and sideline production to enrich and improve the content of labor mutual aid. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trading agencies signing purchase and sale contracts with mutual aid groups is the best way to support production and must be promoted. Cooperatives and state-owned trading agencies must unite private merchants to organize the marketing of local products nationwide and establish wholesale and retail stores for local products everywhere. In some old liberated areas in North China, Northeast China, and Shandong, grain storage righteous granaries (i.e., public accumulation funds) have appeared in labor mutual aid groups, and should be appropriately promoted according to the specific circumstances of each locality. New liberated areas can also be appropriately organized based on the original mutual aid habits of the local masses and according to the principles of voluntariness and equivalence, but forced orders must be opposed.

    It is necessary to lead the broad masses of farmers in fighting against various disasters, so as not to reduce production or reduce production less. Carry out river management, dike repair, ditch digging, pond digging, well drilling, water wheeling, and prevent and control pests such as locusts, borers, and aphids, and diseases such as black smut and jaundice, close mountains for afforestation, and build water source forests, bank protection forests, and windbreak and sand fixation forests.

    It is necessary to strive to increase the production volume per unit area, which is an important key to agricultural production increase. In 1950, the level of farming across the country has been significantly improved. All localities should promote farmers' deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, more weeding, increased fertilization, seed selection, and seed soaking through effective methods such as electing labor models, production exhibitions, technical research conferences, and comparing crops and harvests, in order to improve and improve agricultural technology, and conscientiously summarize farmers' experience for research and promotion.

    It is necessary to vigorously carry out flood control work and strive to avoid disasters in the event of general floods. In areas where water accumulation causes disasters, the masses should be vigorously organized to carry out drainage work in order to be able to sow this year. Universally strengthen and improve channel management and use water economically. Encourage and organize the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects as much as possible and use all possible water sources for irrigation.

    Ensuring the completion of the sown area and harvest volume of cotton, tobacco, and hemp is an extremely important task for agricultural production increase in 1951. Governments at all levels must make detailed plans to ensure the completion of tasks based on the planned figures allocated by the central government and higher levels and the specific circumstances of each locality, and do so with leadership. How to allocate the sown area and how to prepare seeds should all be carefully calculated and planned. In order to increase the production volume per unit area of cotton, tobacco, and hemp, attention must also be paid to timely irrigation and drainage, fertilizer supply, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

    In the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, the people's governments at the county, district, and village levels should concentrate their efforts on agricultural production, do a good job in increasing agricultural production, and the cadres who lead the work must also strive to learn farming knowledge in order to effectively lead farmers in production. In areas where land reform is currently underway, every effort should be made to end land reform before spring plowing; even if it cannot be ended as scheduled, efforts should be made to bring it to a close. Land reform that has not yet begun should not be started for the time being so that it can quickly turn to leading agricultural production without delaying farming time and strive for a bumper harvest this year. After the tense work of spring plowing is completed, land reform or rent reduction and deposit refunds should be carried out during the agricultural slack season. At the same time, agricultural production should not be harmed.
            (4)
    The task of increasing agricultural and forestry production in 1951 is significant. But it is being carried out on the basis of land reform being completed or being completed in most parts of the country, that is to say, in areas with approximately 300 million people, and under the conditions of a national bumper harvest in 1950, improved farmer production capacity, and further social order tending to stabilize in the newly liberated areas where bandit suppression and anti-hegemony victories have been achieved. All of this has created more favorable conditions for restoring and developing production than in 1950. Governments at all levels must attach importance to agricultural and forestry production increase work, correctly implement various agricultural and forestry production policies, and strengthen leadership in order to fully complete the agricultural and forestry production increase task in 1951.

　　中央人民政府政务院
　  关于一九五一年农林生产的决定
    （一九五一年二月二日政务院第七十次政务会议通过）
            （一）
    一九五○年农林增产计划已经胜利地完成了。全国粮食较一九四九年增产百分之一十点八，皮棉增产百分之五十八点九，其他特产、家畜等亦均有显著增加。一九五一年须增产更多的粮食和供给更为充分的工业原料。要求在一九五○年的基础上全国增产粮食百分之七点一；增产棉花百分之三十六点九；增产麻袋用麻百分之六十九点一；增产烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八；增产红茶及青砖茶百分之三十五点一；增产家蚕茧百分之十四点九；增产柞蚕茧百分之五十六点八；增产油原料百分之九点七；增产糖原料百分之二十九点一；增产水产百分之二十点八；并造林二百二十万亩；育树苗五万六千亩；封山育林八百万亩。其他耕畜家畜特产和副业视当地具体条件，尽可能地加以发展。
    为了更好地完成一九五一年的农林增产计划，除要求各地在生产工作上必须注意季节不违农时外，对不同地区应提出不同的要求。即在已经完成土地改革的老解放区，除灾区和战争破坏严重的地区外，普遍要求生产超过战前水平，组织起来，提高技术，有重点地推行按户按村按互助组计划，开展评比和丰产运动。在去冬和今春实行土地改革的地区，要求接近战前生产水平。在只实行减租而尚未实行土地改革的地区，要求生产超过一九五○年的水平。在山地要求树立“吃山养山”长期建设的观点，保护并培育山林，扎山沟，修梯田，开展副业生产，使贫困的山区逐渐走向富裕。在水旱灾区继续贯彻生产自救的方针，切实帮助灾民解决生产中的困难。
            （二）
    为保证一九五一年农林增产的胜利完成，各级人民政府须贯彻以下各项农林生产政策。
    一、土地改革已经完成的老解放区，切实保护人民已得的土地财产，不受侵犯。新解放区在土地改革完成后，立即确定地权，颁发土地证。在尚未进行土地改革而只实行减租的地区，切实保障谁种谁收和农民的佃耕权。
    二、贯彻合理负担的农业税收政策，对因善于经营、勤劳耕作和改良技术而超过常年应产量者，其超过部分不增加公粮负担；因怠于耕作，其产量不及常年应产量者，其应纳公粮不予减少。其产量显著超过当地一般生产水平经过民主评议为众所公认者，人民政府得给以物质的或名誉的奖励，开展群众性的劳模运动和群众性的生产竞赛。所有干部领导生产有显著成绩者，亦应给以奖励。改造不事生产的地主和好吃懒做的懒汉二流子。老解放区的地主和旧式富农，在土地改革以后，服从政府法令，勤于劳动，地主连续五年、富农连续三年以上者，经乡村人民代表大会通过，县人民政府批准，得改变其成份。
    三、劳动互助组，应受到人民政府的各种奖励和优待——得享受国家贷款、技术指导、优良品种、农用药械和新式农具的优先权，以及国家贸易机关推销农业和副业产品、供给生产资料的优先权。农民相互间临时雇佣短工，可予提倡。允许富农经济存在，雇佣劳动自由。
    四、执行奖励主要工业原料作物生产的价格政策，保证棉粮、烟粮和麻粮的合理比价，保证收购和运销。实行优级优价、低级低价、公平合理地按级给价，禁止压低等级收购。推行对农产品的合同制度和预购赊购办法。棉农及烟农的农业负担得于秋后一次征收，并得以棉、烟抵交公粮。
    五、实行山林管理。严禁烧山和滥伐，划定樵牧区域，发动植树种果，推行合作造林。为了保持水土，还应分别不同地区，禁挖树根草根。对保护培育山林和植树造林有显著成绩者，人民政府应给以物质的或名誉的奖励。公有荒山荒地，鼓励群众承领造林，造林后，林权归造林者所有。
    六、奖励兴修水利，因兴修水利而提高产量，属于群众自己出资合作兴办者，其产量提高部分五年以内不改订常年应产量，亦不增加公粮负担，属于国家出资兴办者，其产量提高部分，三年以内不改订常年应产量，亦不增加公粮负担。垦种生荒免纳公粮三年至五年，但绝对禁止开山荒和陡坡。已开之山荒，必须修成梯田。应反复向干部和群众说明，开山荒和陡坡，是有害全体的，“山地开荒、平原遭殃”，是决不能够提倡的。
    七、保障牲畜喂养者的利益。奖励繁殖牲畜，提高经营种畜户的社会地位，并予以扶持。开展家畜防疫运动，并推行牲畜保险。
    八、鼓励农民投资扩大再生产。提倡互助打会，信用合作。提倡自由借贷，必须有借有还。恰当地使用国家投资和贷款。凡为发展农林水利事业的私人投资和帮助农民发展生产的私人借贷，人民政府应给以方便和保障。
    九、在某些闭塞地区，粮食产量较大而无法运出销售者（例如陕北及西南某些省区），除应根据当地可能条件有计划地适当地提倡种植棉、烟、麻等作物外，在可能运出销售的条件下，还应提倡养猪养牛养马及经过政府批准进行烧酒，使农民获得粮食增产的代价。
    十、严禁地主、特务、反动会门的一切破坏行为，如有无故荒芜土地、宰杀耕畜、破坏农具、砍伐树木、拆毁建筑物者，人民政府应给以严厉惩处。
            （三）
    根据一九五○年领导农林生产的经验，对一九五一年农林生产提出如下各点，望各级人民政府加以注意。
    必须继续贯彻毛主席所指示的“组织起来，是由穷变富的必由之路”的方向。反对某些人认为“组织起来，只不过是解决劳动力不足的一个办法而已；在劳动力已有剩余的情况下，人们已能单独生产致富，劳动互助组应该自行解体”的说法。恰恰相反，劳动互助不但可以克服劳动力不足的困难，而且可以进一步达到提高生产的目的。自愿结合、等价交换和民主管理，是组织起来的根本原则，必须遵守。必须结合提高技术、结合副业生产以充实并提高劳动互助的内容。农村供销合作社和国营贸易机关与互助组订立购销合同，是扶助生产的最好办法，必须提倡。合作社和国营贸易机关必须团结私商在全国范围内组织土产品的推销，到处设立土产品的批发和零售店。在华北、东北和山东的某些老解放区，已经出现在劳动互助组中的积谷义仓（即公积金），应视各地具体情况，适当加以提倡。新解放区也可以在当地群众原有的互助习惯的基础上，根据自愿等价原则，加以适当地组织，但须反对强迫命令。
    必须领导广大农民群众和各种灾害作斗争，不减产或少减产。进行治河修堤、开渠挖塘、打井车水，防治蝗、螟、蚜等虫害和黑穗、黄疸等病害，封山育林，营造水源林、护岸林、防风沙林。
    必须努力提高单位面积的生产量，这是农业增产的重要关键。一九五○年全国耕作水平已有显著提高，各地应在这一基础上，通过选举劳动模范、生产展览会、技术研究会和比庄稼、比收成等有效办法，推动农民深耕细作、多锄、增肥、选种、浸种，以改进和提高农业技术，认真地总结农民经验，加以研究推广。
    必须大力进行防洪工作，争取在一般洪水的情况下不致成灾。积水成灾的地区，应大力组织群众进行排水工作，以期今年能够下种。普遍加强和改善渠道管理工作，经济用水。提倡并组织群众尽量兴修小型水利，把一切可能利用的水源都用到灌溉上来。
    保证棉、烟、麻播种面积和收获量的完成，是一九五一年农业增产极为重要的一项任务。各级人民政府均须根据中央和上级所分配的计划数字和各地的具体情况，作出保证完成任务的详细计划，有领导地去做。播种面积如何分配，种籽如何准备，都应有周密的计算和计划。为了提高棉、烟、麻单位面积的生产量，还必须注意及时灌溉排水，供给肥料和防治病虫害的药械。
    在土地改革已经完成的老解放区，县、区、村三级人民政府应集中全力面向农业生产，把农业增产的工作做好，做领导工作的干部并须努力学习耕作知识，以便有效地领导农民进行生产。现正在进行土地改革的地区，应尽可能地争取在春耕以前结束土地改革；即使不能如期结束者，亦应力求告一段落。凡土地改革尚未开始者，则暂时不要开始，以便能迅速地不误农时地集中全力转入领导农业生产，争取今年丰收。在春耕紧张工作完成以后，应利用农忙间隙进行土地改革或减租退押工作，同时，应不妨害农业生产。
            （四）
    一九五一年的农林增产任务是重大的。但他是在全国大部地区，也就是说约有三万万人口的地区已经完成了或正在完成着土地改革的基础上进行的，是在一九五○年全国丰收、农民生产能力提高、新解放区剿匪反霸胜利和社会秩序进一步地趋于安定的条件下进行的。这一切，为恢复和发展生产，创造了较一九五○年更为有利的条件。各级人民政府必须重视农林增产工作，正确贯彻各项农林生产政策，加强领导，以期完满地完成一九五一年的农林增产任务。
