Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The American invading army has been frenziedly massacring Chinese residents in Korea and plundering their property during the invasion of Korea. After the American invading army scurried into the cities of Hamhung and Hungnam on October 17th of last year, they arrested a large number of our overseas Chinese compatriots and subjected them to torture. Zhang Zuxi, the vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese United Association of Hamhung City, was arrested and suffered three electric shocks and beatings. Finally, he was hacked to death by American invaders with an axe. His entire family of six, from his eighty-year-old mother to his two-year-old child, also perished. Xu Yunchang, an overseas Chinese, was dragged from his sickbed and shot by the American army. Among the twenty-five overseas Chinese compatriots arrested in Hungnam City, six farmers who made a living by growing vegetable gardens were stripped naked and burned alive. Xu Zhenshan, who ran a business, was shot and killed by the American army in the middle of the night for no reason.

In November, six American soldiers broke into the International Hotel, which had been run by overseas Chinese compatriots for more than forty years, smashed utensils, looted property, tortured the manager Wang Xinyan, and forcibly demanded women from him. After their beastly behavior failed, they shot and killed Wang Xinyan. Liu Weiji, the manager of the Hua Xian Cafeteria, was also killed in the same situation with his head smashed. Six shop assistants were severely injured by torture, and all their family property was looted. Wang Shutang, an old man who grew vegetable gardens in Shabuli, was beaten to death in the garden by the beasts because he refused to let the American army take his daughter. The sixty-year-old man, Chi Zhisheng, was forced to transport pigs and chickens stolen by bandits. Because he walked slowly, he was beaten to death on the road.

On December 12th, when the American bandits finally fled from North Korea by sea, they arrested more than 400 male and female overseas Chinese and drove them to the seaside. More than a hundred young people and women were taken onto bandit ships. The American bandits set fire to the shops and houses of the overseas Chinese, so that many old people who did not have time to escape were burned alive. An overseas Chinese compatriot named Zhang Shutang was shot and killed in the fire while braving the flames to rescue his elderly father. A dozen overseas Chinese compatriots who refused to board the bandit ship were shot at the dock.

The repeated and frenzied massacres of our overseas Chinese compatriots by the American invading army have aroused great indignation among the overseas Chinese in Korea. They are actively supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, together with the Korean people, to avenge the murdered overseas Chinese compatriots and the Korean people.

　　侵朝美军滔天罪行
    疯狂虐杀我在朝侨民
    【新华社八日讯】美国侵略军在侵朝战争中疯狂虐杀我国居留在朝鲜的侨民，并掠夺其财产。去年十月十七日，美国侵略军窜入咸兴、兴南两市后，曾大批逮捕了我国侨胞，并施以毒刑拷打。华侨联合会咸兴市副委员长张祖熙被捕后，遭受了三次电刑和拷打，最后被美国侵略者用斧头砍杀。其全家六口，从八十岁老母，到两岁幼儿，也一同遭难。华侨徐云昌，被美军从病床上拖去枪杀。在兴南市被捕的二十五名侨胞中，有六个靠种菜园营生的农民被剥光衣服，活活烧死。经营商业的徐振山，半夜里被美军无辜枪杀。
    十一月间，有六个美国兵闯入侨胞经营四十余年的国际饭店，砸毁用具，搜掠财物，拷打经理王信言并向他强索女人，在兽行不遂后便举枪打死了王信言。华鲜食堂经理刘维基，也是在同样情况下被击破头部惨死的，六个店员被拷打重伤，全部家产被抢光。在沙堡里种菜园的王树堂，因拒绝美军向他强索女儿，被野兽们打死在菜园里。六十岁的老汉迟至胜，被逼运送匪徒抢来的猪鸡，由于走的慢，被打死在路上。
    十二月十二日，当美国强盗们在北朝鲜最后从海上逃走时，逮捕了四百多男女华侨，把他们驱逐到海边去。其中百余青年和妇女被押上匪舰。美国强盗们纵火焚烧了华侨的店铺房屋，以致许多来不及逃走的老人被活活烧死。一个名叫张树堂的侨胞冒火抢救老父，也被打死在火里。十数个拒绝登匪舰的侨胞，被枪杀在码头上。
    美国侵略军迭次疯狂的虐杀我国侨胞的罪行，已激起留朝侨胞的莫大激愤，他们正和朝鲜人民一道，积极支援我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，为被害侨胞及朝鲜人民复仇。
