　　Solemn Oath
　　People of Beituan Village, Ding County, Oppose American Rearmament of Japan
　　When the news of American imperialism rearming Japan and plotting a new war reached the vast rural areas of Hebei, the people of Beituan Village in Ding County, who had waged a heroic tunnel warfare against the Japanese invaders, immediately launched a bloody and tearful accusation and angry protest!
　　Although nine years have passed, no villager will forget the horrific massacre of 1942. Like thousands of unyielding villages behind enemy lines at the time, the people of Beituan Village, located close to the Shahe River, joined ten neighboring villages to launch a joint village tunnel war to counter the Japanese invaders' "May 1st Great Sweep." Relying on the tunnels, they cleverly repelled several enemy attacks. Enraged, the Japanese invaders, on May 27th, gathered more than two thousand Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Anping, Wuji, and other places, personally commanded by "Major General Nagakami," to launch an encirclement and annihilation battle against this anti-Japanese fortress village. Under the strong resistance of the militia and the people of nearby villages, the battle lasted from dawn until afternoon, repelling more than ten enemy charges, with the enemy leaving behind more than two hundred corpses. However, the Japanese invaders finally forced their way into the village with superior force. The heroic people unanimously shouted, "Brothers, fight! It's worth dying for one, and a bargain to die for two!" Young men and bearded old men, armed with kitchen knives and dung forks, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Like wounded beasts, the Japanese invaders resorted to inhumane means against these unyielding people—releasing poison gas into the tunnels, causing more than seven hundred heroic people to be tragically poisoned, including many women and children.
　　A catastrophe wiped out more than thirty households in this village of over two hundred households, with every family losing loved ones. The well in Zhu Gende's courtyard was filled with corpses, and blood overflowed outside the gate; Li Huamin's father was tied with hand grenades by the Japanese invaders, detonated, and blown to pieces, his blood stains still remaining on the wall of his house to this day... But the massacre did not frighten the people. After the enemy retreated, the survivors buried the dead, and more than one hundred young men immediately joined the Vanguard Detachment of the Eighth Route Army and plunged into the heart of the enemy to fight.
　　When the reporter visited the village, it was just after the fifth day of the first lunar month, and the whole village was still filled with the joy of the Spring Festival. The militia and young people were playing basketball on the wide playground, while the girls, wives, and children were happily dressing up and singing, preparing to perform in the village on the Lantern Festival. On the ruins burned down by the enemy in the west of the village, seven sunny brick houses have been built, where more than one hundred peasant children from the village are studying and learning to read, many of whom are newborns after the catastrophe. At the southeast entrance of the village where the enemy used to break in, people have built a memorial tower for the relatives who died in the "May 27th" incident. On the stone railings and steles in front of the tower, various heroic images of the people fighting the enemy hand-to-hand and stabbing Japanese devils to death are carved, along with the names of the victims. Many families in the village have colorful lanterns hanging on their gates and bright red Spring Festival couplets posted. One couplet reads: "Oppose the American imperialist aggressor, the chief culprit, and build a democratic and happy family." Indeed, this is the heartfelt desire of all the villagers. After several years of effort, the village's production has surpassed the pre-war level, with every family having enough to eat and wear, and the number of livestock has increased by twenty-two heads compared to before the war, with thirty-five new waterwheels added. In the northwest sandy wasteland of the village, willow forests like walls have been cultivated, and the wounds of the village have healed. People are starting to build a happy life on the ruins. But the scars in people's memories are still vivid. When they heard the news that the United States was rearming Japan, people were furious and shouted in unison: "We must never let those bloody days return!"
　　On the evening of February 16th, a half-moon illuminated this angry village. All the villagers, men, women, old and young, gathered at the memorial tower, facing the graves of their dead relatives, to hold a bloody and tearful accusation and a solemn oath. Among those present were widows who had lost their husbands, orphans who had lost their parents, and many people with scars. Some people still had bullets that had been shot into their muscles by the Japanese invaders and had not been taken out. Everyone had an incalculable blood debt with the Japanese invaders. Widow Wang Jinrui, whose entire family of eleven was killed, leaving only herself, tearfully recounted the tragic death of her family. She roared angrily, "If the Japanese devils come again, I will bite them a few times!" Widow Wang Heidan, who lost her husband and father-in-law, held her only orphan and wept about the tragic death of her relatives who were stabbed to death with bayonets by the Japanese devils. Her tears dripped on the child's head, and she cried and said, "Remember! Your father and grandfather died so tragically!" Li Mishen, a militiaman who had been wounded by the Japanese invaders, said, "My family just had a child. To protect our children, we must resolutely oppose the United States rearming Japan!" The whole venue was filled with sorrowful sobs. Li Huamin, a member of the Chinese Communist Party in the village, stood up, clenched his fist, and said, "Fellow villagers! We must use practical actions to protest the American's evil conspiracy. I propose a few things, and everyone will follow me in swearing an oath to our dead relatives!" Hundreds of arms, like a forest, stood up. The faint moonlight illuminated countless angry faces and firm fists, and a tragic voice rang out from the edge of the village:
　　"Resolutely oppose the United States rearming Japan and actively carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!"
　　"All the villagers unite closely and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities!"
　　"Step up spring plowing and actively support the Chinese People's Volunteers!"
　　"Do not listen to the enemy's rumors!"
　　"Abide by government laws and regulations, do a good job of substitute farming, and ensure that not a single mu of land belonging to military families is left uncultivated!"

　　庄严的宣誓
　  定县北疃村人民反对美国重新武装日本
    当美帝国主义重新武装日本、阴谋发动新战争的消息传到河北广大农村后，曾和日寇进行过壮烈的地道战斗争的定县北疃村人民，立即展开了血泪的控诉和愤怒的抗议！
    时间虽然过去了九年，村民谁也不会忘记一九四二年那个惨绝人寰的大屠杀。正像当时敌后千万个不屈的村庄一样，紧靠沙河畔的北疃村人民，联结附近十个村，展开联村地道战，对付日寇的“五一大扫荡”。他们依靠地道，机智地打退了敌人数次进攻。恼羞成怒的日寇，五月二十七日集结了盘踞安平、无极等地的两千多日伪军，由“永上少将”亲自指挥，向这个抗日堡垒村展开了包围歼灭战。在民兵与附近各村人民坚强抵抗下，战斗从拂晓直到下午，击退了敌人十多次冲锋，敌人丢下二百多具尸体。但日寇终以优势的力量压进了村子。英雄的人民一致高呼着：“兄弟爷们拚呀！拚死一个够本，拚死两个赚一个！”壮年小伙子和有胡子的老头拿着菜刀粪杈，一齐和敌人展开了肉搏战。日寇像受伤了的野兽似的对这些不屈的人们，最后采用了惨无人道的手段——向地道放毒气，七百余英勇的人民惨遭毒害，其中有不少妇女和儿童。
    一场浩劫使这个二百多户的村子死绝了三十多户，家家都有亲人丧失。朱根德院内的井被填满尸体，血水溢在大门外；李化民的父亲，被日寇用手榴弹捆在身上拉了线，炸得血肉横飞，至今他家墙上还留着血印……。但屠杀并没吓倒人民，敌人退走后，活着的掩埋了死掉的，一百多个青年小伙子，立即结队参加了八路军的挺进支队，插到敌人的心脏里去战斗。
    记者访问该村时，正是阴历正月初五刚过，全村还充盈着春节的欢乐。民兵和青年们正在宽阔的操场上赛篮球，姑娘媳妇孩子们兴高彩烈地化装扭唱，准备元宵节出村上演。村西敌人烧毁的废墟上，盖起了七间向阳的大砖房，全村有一百多个农民的孩子在这里念书识字，这些孩子有不少是劫后新生的。在过去敌人突进来的村东南口，人们为“五、二七”死难的亲人，修建了一座纪念塔，塔前石栏石碑上，雕刻着人民与敌肉搏、刺死鬼子的各种英雄形象与死难者的名字。村里不少人家的大门上挂着彩色灯笼、贴着鲜红的春联，有一幅对联写着：“反对美帝侵略罪魁，建设民主幸福家庭。”真的，这是全村人民的心声。经过几年的努力，全村生产已超过战前，家家足吃足穿，牲口较战前增加二十二头，水车新增三十五辆。村西北沙荒地带，培植起围墙似的柳林，村子的创伤已经痊愈了，人们在废墟上开始建立起幸福的生活。但人们记忆中的创痕依旧鲜明，当他们一听说美国重新武装日本的消息时，人们愤怒了，一致呼喊出：“决不能让那血腥的日子重来！”
    二月十六日晚，半圆的月亮照着这个愤怒的村落，全村男女老幼齐集在纪念塔边，面对死难亲人的坟茔，举行血泪的控诉与庄严的宣誓。到场的有失去丈夫的寡妇，丧了父母的孤儿，不少人带着伤疤，有的人肌肉里还带着被日寇打进去还未取出来的枪弹，每个人都与日寇有一笔算不清的血泪仇。全家十一口被残杀只剩下自己一个的寡妇老婆王金瑞，哭诉着一家惨死的情形，她怒吼地说：“鬼子再来我就咬他几口！”失去了丈夫与公爹的寡妇王黑旦老婆，拉着她唯一的孤儿，哭诉鬼子用刺刀挑死他亲人的惨状，她眼泪滴在孩子的头上，痛哭失声的说：“记着！你爹你爷死的好惨啊！”曾被日寇杀伤的民兵李米深说：“我家才添个小孩，为保卫孩子，我们要坚决反对美国再武装日本！”全场充满了悲愤的抽咽声。该村中共党员李化民站起来握着拳头说：“乡亲们！我们要用实际行动抗议美国的罪恶阴谋。我提出几条，大家跟着我向死去的亲人宣誓！”几百条臂膀，丛林一般地竖起来，淡淡的月光照着无数个愤怒的脸和坚实的拳头，村边响起了悲壮的声音：
    “坚决反对美国重新武装日本，积极开展抗美援朝运动！”
    “全村人民紧密团结，坚决镇压反革命活动！”
    “加紧春耕，积极支援中国人民志愿军！”
    “不听信敌人的谣言！”
    “遵守政府法令，作好代耕工作，保证军属不荒一亩地！”
