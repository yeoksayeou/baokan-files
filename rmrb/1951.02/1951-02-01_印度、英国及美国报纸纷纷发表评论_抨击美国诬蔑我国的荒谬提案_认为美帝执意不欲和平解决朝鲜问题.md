Xinhua News Agency, 31st -- Many Indian newspapers believe that the US government is determined not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Hindustan Times stated: "The United Nations proposed a ceasefire agreement as a prerequisite for negotiations to resolve the Korean War. China's response was that such an agreement could be part of the negotiations. Recently, China suggested agreeing to a limited-time ceasefire during the first meeting of the proposed seven-nation conference." The newspaper believes that negotiations are thus possible. The newspaper said, "If the United States really wants to disregard China's proposal, then it will not be beneficial to the cause of peace."

The National Herald, commenting on the recent debates in the UN Political Committee, said: "The recent discussions in the UN Political Committee give the impression that China wants peace while the United States does not. If the United States wants to correct this impression, then it must come up with more convincing reasons, and not just the kind of reasons it has been putting forward in insisting on passing its proposal to condemn China as an aggressor, at a time when there is still an opportunity to achieve a glorious peace by showing some patience."

The Sentinel, referring to the US government's belief that their proposal to smear China as an "aggressor" could be passed by the UN voting machine, said: "But the problem is too serious to be solved by voting, because what is at stake is nothing less than the future of humanity. If the United States insists on winning, then it will only win a victory that is not worth the cost."

Xinhua News Agency, 31st -- Many British newspapers and individuals are very dissatisfied with the US's efforts to have the UN pass a proposal smearing our country as an "aggressor." The Yorkshire Post complained that the US is "strangely abandoning the opportunity for negotiations without careful consideration." The Manchester Guardian accused the US of having "a large presence" of "simply acting according to emotions and prejudices."

The Sunday Times is dissatisfied with the US's refusal to negotiate the Taiwan issue and the Korean War issue together. The newspaper said, "President Truman's own policy has linked the neutralization of Taiwan with the Korean War." The newspaper said, "Therefore, the aim of diplomacy is to end the Korean War and the dispute over Taiwan together. This goal has no hope of being achieved if the major issues that are interdependent are not included in one negotiation."

The Observer listed a recent public opinion poll conducted in the United States, saying: This poll showed that 57 percent of Americans support China's admission to the United Nations. "Under these circumstances, we should not be misled by the picture of the American people being preoccupied with pursuing war and ignoring the demands of their allies." The newspaper advocated that Western countries should revise their policies based on the new situation. The Reynold News said: "The current attempt to label China as an aggressor and impose sanctions on it is an attempt to seek powers that the United Nations does not currently possess." The newspaper commented on the US's accusation that China "is trying to break into the United Nations" by saying that this accusation "does not solve any problems. The founding of the United States was also achieved through fighting, and the United States doing so was a good thing for the world." The newspaper said, "The question is: to accommodate the Asian revolutionary movement, which is as significant as the American colonial revolution, into the international family, rather than first plunging humanity into war and suffering devastation."

An Agence France-Presse reporter mentioned the opinion of well-informed sources in London, saying: "In Britain's view, the US's request to take measures unfavorable to China carries the risk of causing sanctions against China, which may be both ineffective and dangerous."

Former Secretary of the British Information Bureau, Terry, expressed this dissatisfaction in a speech to the "English-Speaking Union" in New York on the 25th. He said, "I do feel there is a real danger." "Britain and the Asian countries of the Commonwealth have some doubts on this point." He expressed his fear that the United States would cause an Asian war, the consequences of which would be "a disaster" for Britain and the Commonwealth countries, because Britain and the Commonwealth countries are "more vulnerable in Asia than the United States."

An article broadcast by the British Information Service on the 29th, "British Policy in the Far East Crisis," also pointed out: "The British government fears that the issue of condemning Communist China, especially the issue of imposing sanctions, may contribute to the division of the United Nations. It is particularly important that this may alienate the free countries of Asia from the free countries of the West. Such a division is obviously particularly unfavorable to Britain, because Britain has close federal ties with India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and it is deeply concerned about the future of Southeast Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, 31st -- New York News: The American Worker's Daily has continuously published editorials criticizing the US government for insisting on its absurd proposal in the UN Political and Security Committee to smear China as an "aggressor." The newspaper's editorial on January 18 stated: "The US government is attempting to obstruct the peace that many countries are seeking in the United Nations. It refuses to recognize China as a sovereign independent country and refuses to treat China as an equal member in any negotiations." The editorial said: The US government's intention is very clear. "Acheson assured some senators who were afraid of achieving peace in Korea that he never intended to negotiate with China, nor did he intend to return Taiwan to China, or even to reach an agreement on ending the Korean War. They are not seeking peace; this could not be clearer."

The newspaper's editorial on January 19 also said: A sovereign independent country like China can never accept the US's ceasefire proposal. "China is independent and powerful. It cannot be manipulated at will like a colony or a Marshall Plan dependency. This is known throughout Asia."

### 印度、英国及美国报纸纷纷发表评论  抨击美国诬蔑我国的荒谬提案  认为美帝执意不欲和平解决朝鲜问题

　　印度、英国及美国报纸纷纷发表评论
    抨击美国诬蔑我国的荒谬提案       
    认为美帝执意不欲和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社三十一日讯】印度许多报纸认为，美国政府正执意不要和平解决朝鲜问题。印度斯坦时报称：“联合国提议以停火协议作为解决朝鲜战争谈判的先决条件，中国的答复是此种协议可以作为谈判的一部分，最近中国又建议在拟议中的七国会议举行第一次会议时可以同意作有限度时间的停火。该报认为，这样一来，谈判是可以举行的。该报说：“假若美国真要不顾中国的建议，那么这对和平事业是没有用处的。”
    国民先驱报于评论联合国政治委员会最近的辩论说：“最近联合国政委会的讨论给人一种印象，即：中国要和平而美国不要和平。如果美国想矫正这个印象，那末在这表现出一些耐心就仍有机会获得光荣的和平的时候，它就得拿出更有力的道理来，而不仅是它在坚持通过它的谴责中国为侵略者的提案时所拿出的那种道理。”
    仙酒市场报在谈到美国政府方面以为他们诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的提案能够得到联合国表决机器通过时说：“但是问题太严重了，不是表决得了的，因为悬在那里的不是别的，而是人类的前途。如果美国坚持取得胜利，那它将赢得的只是一个得不偿失的胜利。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】英国许多报纸和若干人士对美国竭力使联合国通过诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的提案一举甚为不满。约克郡邮报抱怨说：美国“不经慎重考虑而即抛弃谈判的机会，真是怪事”。“曼彻斯特卫报”指责美国“大量存在”着“单纯地依照感情和偏见行事”。
    “星期日泰晤士报”不满美国拒绝把台湾问题与朝鲜战争问题一并谈判解决。该报说：“杜鲁门总统自己的政策已把中立台湾与朝鲜战争连在一起了。”该报说：“因此外交方面的目的乃是将朝鲜战争和关于台湾的纠纷一并结束。如果不将互相依附的主要问题列入一次谈判中，这个目标就没有达成的希望。”
    “观察家报”列述最近在美国所举行的一次民意测验说：这次民意测验表明，美国人民百分之五十七赞成容纳中国进入联合国。“在这种情况之下，我们就不应该被那幅描绘美国人民专心追求战争而不理睬盟国要求的图画所迷惑”。该报主张西方国家应该根据新的情况修改方针。“雷诺新闻”说：“目前指中国为侵略者并对之施以制裁的企图，乃是想要企求于联合国现在所未具有的权力”。该报评论美国指责中国“正试图打进联合国”时说，这种指责“是解决不了任何问题的。美国的立国也是打出来的，而美国这样做了，对于世界乃是一件好事”。该报说：“问题是：把与美洲殖民地革命同样有意义的亚洲革命运动容纳到国际大家庭中，而不是首先使人类堕入战争而遭受洗劫”。
    法新社记者提及伦敦消息灵通人士的意见说：“在英国看来，美国要求采取不利中国的措施有促使对中国施行制裁的危险，而这种制裁，可能是既无效果而又有危险的。”
    前任英国新闻局长秘书特里二十五日在纽约“英语民族协会”上演说中道出了这种不满的缘由。他说：“我确实感到有一个真正危险。”“英国及英联邦亚洲各国在这一点上有所疑惧”。他表示恐惧美国会引起亚洲大战，而其结果对英国和英联邦来说是“一种灾难”，因为英国与英联邦各国“在亚洲较美国尤为脆弱”。
    英国新闻处二十九日广播的《英国在远东危机中的政策》一文亦指出：“英国政府害怕：谴责共产党中国的问题，特别是施行制裁的问题，可能会促成联合国的分裂。尤其重要的是这可能使亚洲的自由国家背离西方的自由国家。这样的分裂显然是对英国特别不利的，因为英国和印度，巴基斯坦及锡兰之间有着联邦纽带紧密连系着，它对于东南亚的前途是深切地关怀着的。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】纽约讯：美国工人日报连续发表社论，抨击美国政府坚持其在联合国政治安全委员会上提出的诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的荒谬提案。该报一月十八日的社论说：“美国政府企图阻挠许多国家在联合国中所寻求的和平。它拒绝承认中国为主权独立的国家，拒绝在任何谈判中视中国为平等的一员。”社论说：美国政府的意图是很明显的。“艾奇逊曾向一部分害怕达成朝鲜和平的参议员保证说：他从来不打算和中国开谈判，也不打算把台湾归还中国，甚至不准备在停止朝鲜战争的问题上取得协议。他们并不祈求和平，这是再明白不过的。”
    该报一月十九日社论又说：像中国这样一个主权独立的国家绝不能接受美国的停火建议。“中国是独立和强大的。它不能像殖民地或马歇尔计划附庸国那样，任人随意摆布。这是全亚洲都知道的”。
