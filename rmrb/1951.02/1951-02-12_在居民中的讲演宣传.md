　　Lectures and Propaganda Among Residents
　　Su·Sobolev
    Lectures play a significant role in the Bolshevik Party's ideological and political work among the masses. Lectures are one of the most important methods of propagating Marxism-Leninism, and a method of communist education for laborers and of struggling against capitalist remnants in people's consciousness. Lectures enhance the political and labor enthusiasm of communist builders, arm them with scientific knowledge, and broaden their cultural horizons.

    The possibilities for conducting lecture propaganda among Soviet residents are exceptionally great. This is because illiteracy has long been eliminated in our country, and all our people are studying; the doors of primary and secondary schools, specialized schools, and higher education institutions are open to laborers. The ranks of millions of new Soviet intellectuals, cultivated by the Party and the Soviet government, are flesh and blood with the people, loyally serving the people's interests and regarding the dissemination of knowledge to the masses as their important responsibility. The Soviet state possesses the world's largest network of cultural and educational institutions: cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, museums. All of these can be used to conduct large-scale lecture propaganda that attracts the entire adult population.

    Lecture propaganda among laborers in the Soviet Union is carried out by state and social organizations, with the Party bearing the responsibility for local leadership—combining the efforts of various organizations engaged in lecture propaganda to move towards the same goal.

    The All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, founded in 1947 on the recommendation of a number of scholars, plays a significant role in lecture propaganda. The Society has over 130,000 formal members and over 113,000 candidate members; more than 1,800 organizations are collective members. The Society has launched extensive lecture propaganda among residents. Lecture bureaus attached to the Cultural and Educational Affairs Committees in republics, provinces, and districts, as well as lecture groups organized by the Communist Youth League and trade unions, are also carrying out a large amount of work.

    Recently, agricultural propaganda administrations have been established in the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms, and the Ministry of Cotton Production in the Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, border regions, and provinces. The task of these administrations is to organize planned and systematic mass agricultural propaganda, one of the forms of which is lecture work.

    Party organizations directly conduct enormous lecture work among the masses. A vast number of Party activists serve as lecturers, and many Party committees frequently organize lecturers and reporters to go from the provincial center to the countryside.

    Giving lectures and political reports in factories, collective farms, and electoral districts—is the responsibility of Party workers and an important component of the entire Party's political work. However, as facts indicate, some Party leaders rarely give political reports or lectures to laborers, nor do they pay attention to lecture propaganda. This illustrates the incorrect working style of these leaders, who have forgotten the Party's political work.

    The widely distributed lecture propaganda organs unite a huge cultural force. Their role in the communist education of laborers grows day by day under the constant leadership of the Party. It is very important that the leaders of local lecture propaganda organizations are politically mature and cultured people, and that unlearned people are not allowed to engage in this great cause. Party committees must ensure that they are good at utilizing various forms and methods of lecture propaganda.

    Some Party committees are often satisfied with the large numbers of lectures given in the province, city, or district, and do not carefully analyze what is hidden behind these numbers. At the same time, lecturers often only go to districts closer to the provincial center, while in remote districts, they are still rare guests; some residents do not have enough opportunities to hear lectures. For example, lecture propaganda is still very weak in the Grozny, Ulyanovsk, Bryansk, and Velikiye Luki provinces.

    Locally, there are all possibilities to expand lecture propaganda more widely. It should be pointed out that the lecture bureaus that have emerged in recent years in many enterprises, state farms, machine tractor stations, and collective farms are of particular importance. The very fact that lecture bureaus have been established proves the growth of residents' cultural and technical level, and proves the masses' desire for political and scientific knowledge. The establishment of lecture bureaus is possible because many intellectual cadres have grown up locally who can meet the various cultural needs of laborers. For example, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine has put forward the task of establishing a lecture bureau in every village with appropriate rural intellectual cadres.

    There are now about 50,000 lecture bureau organizations nationwide. But it is not enough to only see the organization of lecture bureaus. They need constant help and systematic cooperation. The responsibility of Party committees is to ensure that organizations conducting lecture propaganda provide lecturers with lecture topics, provide rural lecturers with methodological assistance, and popularize the working experience of lecturers. They should also be concerned with ensuring that lecture bureaus have appropriate reference books and reference materials.

    To effectively lead lecture propaganda—means to delve into the topics of lectures, supervise their quality, and make them profound in content and easy to accept in form. As we advance towards communism, the cultural needs of Soviet people, who are extraordinarily concerned about the Bolshevik Party's and the Soviet government's domestic and foreign policies and various scientific, technological, and cultural issues, are also growing. One of the important tasks of Party organizations is to ensure that lecture propaganda can fully meet these requirements, and ensure that the topics of lectures reflect the various needs of the masses.

    The propaganda of Marxism-Leninism knowledge requires special attention. Millions of people in our country are studying Marxism-Leninism theory. Party, state, and social organizations, in order to meet the needs of laborers, have organized lectures on the history and theory of Bolshevism, which explain the superiority of the Soviet social and state system and the policies of the Bolshevik Party, as well as the lives and activities of the great revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin. Lectures on the lives and activities of Lenin and Stalin have great cognitive and educational significance. Studying the history and theory of Bolshevism and the biographies of Bolshevik Party leaders can help Soviet people understand the laws of political struggle, the laws of communist construction, and cultivate in the masses the highly valued qualities of ardent Soviet patriots.

    The policies of the Bolshevik Party, which form the basis of life in the Soviet system, determine the direction and content of lecture propaganda. When explaining the Party's policies and depicting the prospects of communism, lecturers should focus primarily on cultivating Soviet patriotism. The propaganda of Soviet patriotism will further enhance the ideological level of Soviet people, consolidate their belief in the final victory of our cause, and strengthen their enthusiasm in the struggle to build a communist society. Not only should specialized lectures on this topic do so, but all other topics of lectures should also be permeated with the ideas of Soviet patriotism.

    Lectures on the great communist construction—on the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, on the opening of the Turkmen Main Canal, and the South Ukraine and North Crimean Canals—have great utility. They arouse in Soviet people a pride in their motherland, which is confidently embarking on the road of communist construction, and arouse in them a fervent desire to further increase the glory and power of the motherland through creative labor. Recently, workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals have been given lectures such as "The Great Construction of Communism," "The National Economic Significance of the Great Communist Construction," "The Role of the Great Stalin Construction in Creating the Material and Technical Base of Communism," and others. The propaganda of the great Stalin construction is an important task for all organizations engaged in lecture work.

    The issue of the Party's economic policy should occupy a prominent place in lecture work. Lectures explaining the importance of the struggle for profitability in industrial enterprises, the struggle to increase labor productivity, conserve materials, and strive to improve product quality, and lectures pointing out the great economic and political significance of innovators and the experience of mass socialist competition as the driving force for communist construction, all promote the growth of laborers' production enthusiasm. It is important for lectures to arm laborers with knowledge of socialist enterprise cost savings, such as methods to reduce product prices, economic accounting systems, and the circulation of funds.

    Lectures—an important method of propagating scientific achievements and advanced experiences in agriculture. Soviet scholars lecture in collective farms and state farms, explaining to collective farmers and state farm workers the scientific basis of agriculture and animal husbandry, introducing them to the latest achievements in agricultural biology, and pointing out to them the specific paths to increase harvests and livestock prosperity. Lectures promoting the latest achievements of advanced socialist agriculture can help adopt the experience of innovators. The lecture bureau established by the branch of the Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge in the Ukhtom District of the Moscow Province demonstrates a good example of agricultural propaganda. It organized a cycle of lectures on the scientific basis of Michurin, crop production, and animal production. Prominent Soviet scholars also participated in the lecture work along with local intellectuals. The cycle of lectures was also supplemented by film screenings, experiments, and question-and-answer sessions. The Michurin doctrine lectures conducted by the twelve lecture bureaus in the district gave collective farmers great help.

    In the struggle against capitalist remnants in people's consciousness, lectures play a great role. Lectures on the Party's ideological work, on the socialist attitude towards labor, on communist morality, on opposing cosmopolitanism and opposing adulation of foreign things, enhance the socialist consciousness of laborers and educate them in the communist ideological spirit.

    In the current situation, the propaganda of natural science knowledge is of particular importance. This propaganda can promote the further rise of the cultural level of the broad masses of laborers, promote the overcoming of capitalist remnants in people's consciousness, and promote the overcoming of superstition and prejudice. Now, in many republics and provinces, the propaganda of scientific atheism has become more active; there are also more lectures on natural science topics: such as the occurrence and development of life on earth, the origin of humans, and the origin and life of animals and plants. Laborers have expressed great interest in lectures that reveal the class essence of religious views and the harm of religious ideas. However, all organizations engaged in lecture propaganda are far from meeting the demand for lectures on topics for scientific atheists. Natural science propaganda should be expanded more widely, while paying attention to improving the ideological and theoretical level of this propaganda.

    Soviet people are extremely interested in the heroic history of the various nationalities of our motherland and their cultural achievements. Lectures on these topics should occupy an important place in lecture work.

    Due to the preparations for the elections to the Supreme Soviets of the various Union and Autonomous Republics, there are huge tasks before the organizations engaged in lecture propaganda. Much experience has been accumulated in lecture work among voters. At various polling stations, lectures are given that reveal the achievements of communist construction and explain the Stalin Constitution and the election law. In the Leningrad Province, the following lecture topics were given to voters: "Comrade Stalin—the Creator of the World's Most Democratic Constitution," "The Party of Lenin and Stalin—the Inspirer and Organizer of the Soviet People in the Struggle for the Victory of Communism," "The Great Construction of Communism—Striking Evidence of the Power of Soviet Society," "Comrade Stalin—the Inspirer and Organizer of the Crushing of the German Fascist Army near Leningrad," and so on. Here, a province-wide discussion meeting of the Party Committee lecturers was held, and participants received guidance on the tasks of conducting mass political work among voters. The Party Provincial Committee dispatched a large number of lecturers to various districts to report on the election campaign. Due to the elections to the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, many other Party Provincial Committees also dispatched many lecturers and reporters to the districts.

    In many provinces, lecture bureaus and branches of the Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge actively participated in the election campaign. They formulated lecture topic catalogs and lecture notes for distribution to various districts, assigned lecturers to various electoral districts, and organized Society members to give lectures to voters in the countryside.

    In places where there is no systematic supervision by the Party, lecture work plans are often filled with accidental and secondary topics, losing their purposefulness. This situation is especially evident in the lecture work among rural residents in several western provinces of Ukraine. The farmers in these provinces have embarked on a new path of collective farm development relatively recently and pay particular attention to various issues of collective farm construction. However, these needs are far from being met. In some western provinces of Ukraine, there are very few lecture meetings for leaders of collective farms. In major villages, there are also very few lectures on the Bolshevik Party's land policy, agricultural collectivization, and the socialist transformation of cities and rural areas in the western provinces of the Ukrainian Republic. The Stalin Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter is also not promoted enough.

    In lecture propaganda, it is very important to consider the various interests and needs of laborers and to treat different strata of residents differently. In many places, lectures on Soviet pedagogy were organized for parents. Lecture groups of the Communist Youth League specifically organized lecture meetings for young people.

    The demands of laborers on organizations conducting lecture work are constantly growing. In many cases, general lectures can no longer satisfy the audience, and they demand to study this or that issue in depth. In order to meet the needs of the masses, branches of the Society and lecture bureaus have organized cycles of lectures on the most different issues. In many cities (Moscow, Leningrad, Gorky, Kuibyshev, etc.), lectures are held on the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, etc. In some provinces, cycles of lectures on Michurin biology have been held.

    Cycle lectures are very popular; it would be best to conduct them everywhere.

    The supervision of the ideological content of lectures is the most important task of Party leadership in lecture propaganda. Only under the Party's systematic supervision can the high ideological and theoretical level of lectures be guaranteed, and can shortcomings in this regard be eliminated.

    For example, lectures on international issues. Soviet people who support the cause of peace show a special interest in the international situation. Organizations engaged in lecture propaganda have done a lot of work in meeting the requirements of Soviet people with good international issue lectures. However, sometimes these lectures on these topics are superficial and often a simple list of facts and events. In some lectures, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of international relations and their development prospects, and the role and significance of the Soviet Union in resolving international issues is not expressed enough. In lectures on international issues, it is particularly important to emphasize the intensification of contradictions in the imperialist camp, the strength of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp, and the influence and authority of the main leading force of the anti-imperialist camp—the Soviet Union.

    By strengthening the supervision of the quality of lecturers' work on international issues and organizing to provide them with capable assistance, the Party Committee can eliminate shortcomings in lectures.

    The level of lectures is mainly determined by the composition of the lecturers. To fight for the high quality of lectures—means to first correctly select and systematically educate lecture cadres. Strict attention should be paid to the work of the branches of the Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, to improve the role of each branch in the struggle for the quality of lectures, to organize truly critical discussions of lecture notes, and to not allow liberalism to arise in evaluations. The experience of the propaganda departments of some Provincial Committees in organizing critical discussions of lecture notes is worth treasuring.

    In many provinces, Party Committees have held discussion meetings of lecturers on various topics. If the work of these discussion meetings is organized correctly, it will show a great impact in improving the ideological and theoretical level of lectures. In the discussion meetings, it is extremely important to ensure that there is a lively discussion and analysis of a certain lecture and to exchange working experiences. As an example, the Republic Lecturers' Discussion Meeting held in Latvia discussed a speech on the topic "Soviet Democracy and Its Superiority over Bourgeois Democracy." The participants of the discussion meeting made many valuable comments on the content of the lecture and the form of explanation of the material. In addition, at the lecturers' discussion meeting, they should also report to them the most important resolutions of the Party and the government and the economic and political tasks before the Party organization.

    The discussion of lecture propaganda issues in the Party Committee has a serious impact on the quality of lectures. In 1950, these issues were discussed at a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Azerbaijan. The plenary session revealed some serious shortcomings in the organization and content of lecture work and pointed out a broad program for improvement. The question of the situation of lecture work was then discussed in the Provincial Committees, most Municipal Committees, and District Committees in the Republic. The Party organizations in Ukraine also systematically engage in the content and organization of lecture work among the masses, especially in the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, and Odessa Provinces. The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine has repeatedly discussed ways to improve lecture work among the masses.

    However, many Party organizations still have not delved into the essence of lecture propaganda and do not strive for the high quality of lectures. For example, lecture propaganda is not well organized in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Republic has not organized the supervision of lecture quality in the Republic Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge. Branches of the Society rarely convene lecturers, lecture notes are not discussed, and people with little accomplishment are often found to give lectures. The supervision of lecture quality in the Lviv Province is also unsatisfactory. At the meeting of lecturers of the Lviv Branch of the Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, the analysis and discussion of lecture notes is often formalistic and lacks good criticism.

    Some Party Committees replace the systematic supervision of the quality of lecture propaganda with imagined campaign methods. For example, the Tomsk Provincial Committee of the Party often proposes to conduct a competition for the best lecture. This empty and poisonous idea has nothing in common with the methods of true Bolshevik leadership of mass political work. The responsibility of the Party Committee is to ensure that every lecture can fully fulfill the task of the communist education of laborers, and ensure that every lecture is scientific, clear in content, and easy to be accepted in form. To achieve this goal, one cannot use the illusory method of similar competition, but must give persistent attention to the ideological and political education and methodological training of propaganda cadres, and establish the Party's systematic supervision of the quality of lecture propaganda.

    The form of the lecture cannot be neglected, but unfortunately, this often happens to us. Being good at utilizing facts in local life can help the effectiveness of the lecture. Examples and literary images can make the lecture lively. It is very beneficial to discuss not only the content of the lecture at the discussion meeting of lecturers, but also to consider the form and methods of lecture work. It is very important to collect and summarize the response to the lecture, and to make the lecturers consider the opinions and advice of the audience.

    Lecture propaganda—is a fighting part of ideological work. Party organizations should do all the necessary work to improve the level of lecture propaganda to be able to assume the requirements put forward by the Bolshevik Party.

　　在居民中的讲演宣传
　　苏·索勃列夫
    布尔什维克党在群众之间的思想政治工作中，讲演具有重大的意义。讲演是宣传马列主义的最重要方法之一，是劳动者共产主义教育和与人们意识中的资本主义残余做斗争的方法。讲演提高着共产主义建设者的政治积极性和劳动积极性，并以科学知识武装他们，扩大他们的文化眼界。
    在苏联居民之间从事讲演宣传的可能性异常巨大。因为在我国早已铲除了文盲，我们的全体人民都在学习；中小学校、专科学校和高等学院的门，在劳动者的面前敞开着。由党和苏维埃政府所培养出来的数以百万计的新的苏联知识分子的队伍，与人民血肉相连，忠诚地服务于人民的利益并认为把知识传播到群众中去是自己的重要责任。苏维埃国家拥有世界上最广大的文化教育机关网：文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆、博物馆。所有这一切都可用以进行大规模的、吸引全部成年居民的讲演宣传。
    在劳动者之间的讲演宣传，在苏联是由国家的和社会的组织来进行的，党在地方上领导的责任——就是把从事讲演宣传的各组织的努力结合起来使步向同一的目的。
    在讲演宣传中起着显著作用的是全苏政治及科学知识普及协会，这协会是一九四七年依据一些学者的建议而创立的。协会拥有十三万以上正式会员，十一万三千多候补会员；有一千八百多个组织是集体会员。协会在居民之间展开了广泛的讲演宣传。在共和国、省和区中的文化教育事业委员会之下所附设的讲演局，共青团和职工会组织的讲演者团体也进行着大量工作。
    近来，在苏联农业部、国营农场部和棉产部下在加盟共和国、自治共和国、边区和省中，设立了农业宣传管理局。这些管理局的任务，就是组织有计划地、有系统地群众农业宣传，其形式之一就是讲演工作。
    各党组织在群众中直接地进行巨大的讲演工作。广大的党的积极分子来做讲演人，许多党委会经常组织讲演人和报告人，从省中心下到农村去。
    在工厂、集体农场和选举区做讲演和政治报告—一是党的工作人员的责任，是全体党的政治工作的一个重要组成部分。然而，如事实所指出，一些党的领导者很少向劳动者做政治报告或讲演，也并不注视讲演宣传。这就说明了这些领导者的不正确的工作作风，他们忘却了党的政治工作。
    广泛分布的讲演宣传机关，团结着巨大的文化力量。他们在劳动者的共产主义教育中的作用，在党的时时领导条件下，一天天增长起来。很重要的一件事，是使地方上讲演宣传组织的领导人是政治上成熟的、有文化的人，不要使不学无术的人从事这一伟大事业。党委会要保证善于利用讲演宣传的各种形式和方法。
    在某些党委会中时时满意于省、市或区中所做过的讲演的庞大数字，并不肯仔细分析这些数字的背后隐藏着什么。同时，讲演人常常是只到距省中心较近的各区中去，而在遥远的区中，他们仍旧是稀客；有一些居民所能听到的讲演则完全不够。例如，在哥罗兹尼、乌里扬诺夫、布凉斯基、维利科路克诸省中，讲演宣传仍然是很薄弱的。
    在地方上，有一切可能更加广泛地展开讲演宣传。应该指出，近年来在许多企业、国营农场、机器拖拉机站和集体农场中涌现出来的讲演局，尤其具有重大的作用。设立讲演局的事实本身，就证明了居民文化技术水平的增长，证明了群众对政治及科学知识的渴望。设立讲演局之成为可能，就因为在地方上生长了许多能够满足劳动者各种文化需要的知识分子干部。例如，乌克兰共产党（布）中央委员会就曾提出这样的任务：在每一个具有适当的农村知识分子干部的村庄中，建立讲演局。
    全国现在已有约五万讲演局的组织。但只看到讲演局的组织是不行的。它们需要时时帮助和有系统的协力。党委会的责任，就是注意使进行讲演宣传的组织给讲演者订出讲演题目，给农村讲演者以方法的帮助，普及讲演者的工作经验。也应该关心到保证讲演局有适当的参考书和参考文件。
    切实地领导讲演宣传—就是说要深入讲演的题目，监督它们的质量，使它们达到内容深刻、形式上容易接受。由于我们向共产主义前进的程度，异常关怀布尔什维克党和苏联政府内外政策及各种科学、技术和文化问题的苏维埃人的文化需要也增长着。党组织的重要任务之一，就是要保证讲演宣传能完全满足这些要求，保证使讲演的题材反映出群众的各方面需要。
    马列主义知识的宣传，需要特殊注意。我国数百万人都正在学习马列主义理论。党的、国家的和社会的组织为了满足劳动者需要，组织了关于布尔什维主义历史和理论的讲演，这些讲演是解释苏维埃社会及国家制度的优越性和布尔什维克党的政策的，同时也有关于革命的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林的生活和活动的。关于列宁和斯大林的生活和活动的讲演具有重大的认识和教育意义。研究布尔什维主义的历史和理论，研究布尔什维克党领袖的传记，可以帮助苏联人们认识政治斗争的法则，认识共产主义建设的法则，在群众中培养热情的苏联爱国者的高度的珍贵品质。
    组成苏维埃制度生活基础的布尔什维克党的政策，确定着讲演宣传的方向和内容。讲演者们在解释党的政策时，在描绘共产主义远景时，应该把主要的注意放在培养苏维埃的爱国主义方面。苏维埃爱国主义的宣传，会更加提高苏维埃人的思想水平，巩固他们对我们事业的最后胜利的信念，加强他们在争取建设共产主义社会斗争中的积极性。不仅是这个题目的专题讲演如此，而且一切其他题目的讲演，也应该贯穿着苏维埃爱国主义的思想。
    关于伟大的共产主义建设——关于在伏尔加河和第聂泊河上建设水电站，关于开凿土库曼大运河，南乌克兰和北克里米运河的讲演，都有巨大的效用。它们引起苏维埃人对自己充满信心走上共产主义建设道路的祖国感到骄傲，引起他们以创造性劳动更加增大祖国的光荣和威力的热烈企望。近来给工人、集体农民和知识分子做了以下的讲演：如《共产主义的伟大建设》，《共产主义伟大建筑的国民经济意义》，《伟大的斯大林建筑在创造共产主义物质、技术基础中的作用》及其他。伟大的斯大林建筑的宣传，是进行讲演工作的各组织的重要任务。
    党的经济政策问题，应该在讲演工作中占显著的地位。解释争取工业企业赢利斗争、争取提高劳动生产率、节约材料和争取改善产品质量的重要性的讲演，指出革新者和作为共产主义建设动力的群众社会主义竞赛经验的巨大经济政治意义的讲演，都促进劳动者生产积极性的增长。讲演以社会主义企业节约问题的知识武装劳动者，是很重要的，例如谈到减低产品价格的方法、经济核算制、资金的流转等问题。
    讲演——宣传农业中科学成就和先进经验的重要方法。苏联学者在集体农场和国营农场中讲演，给集体农民和国营农场的工作者解释农业和牧畜的科学基础，介绍给他们农业生物学中的最新成就，指给他们提高收获量和牲畜繁荣的具体道路。推广社会主义农业先进者的最新成就的讲演，可以帮助采用革新者的经验。莫斯科省乌赫托姆区，由政治和科学普及协会分会建立的讲演局，表示出很好的农业宣传的范例。它组织了关于米邱林科学基础、植物生产和畜产的循环讲演。苏联著名学者也和当地知识分子一同参加讲演工作。循环讲演时还以放映电影、实验和问题解答来辅助。在区中的十二个讲演局进行的米邱林学说讲演，给了集体农民巨大的帮助。
    在与人们意识中的资本主义残余斗争中，讲演的作用是很大的。关于党的思想工作问题，关于对劳动的社会主义态度问题，关于共产主义道德，关于反对世界主义和反对对外国事物的阿谀的讲演，提高了劳动者的社会主义意识，以共产主义的思想精神教育了他们。
    在现今的情况下，自然科学知识的宣传，具有特殊重要的意义。这种宣传可以促进广大劳动者文化水平的进一步高涨，促进克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，促进克服迷信和偏见。现在，在许多共和国和省中，科学无神论的宣传已有些活跃起来；自然科学题目的讲演也多些了：如关于大地上生活的发生和发展，关于人的产生，动植物的产生和生活。劳动者对于揭发宗教见解的阶级本质和宗教思想的毒害的讲演，表示了巨大的兴趣。但是全体从事讲演宣传的组织，远不能满足对科学无神论者的题目的讲演要求。应该更广泛地展开自然科学宣传，同时要注意提高这种宣传的思想理论水平。
    苏维埃人对我们祖国各民族英勇的历史和他们的文化成就，异常有兴趣。这些题目的讲演，应该在讲演工作中占有重要地位。
    由于准备各加盟共和国和自治共和国的最高苏维埃选举，所以在进行讲演宣传的组织面前有着巨大的任务。在选民中的讲演工作已积蓄了不少经验。在各选举站，做一些揭示共产主义建设成就、解释斯大林宪法和选举法的讲演。在列宁格勒省为选民做了以下这些题目的讲演：《斯大林同志——世界上最民主的宪法的创造者》，《列宁、斯大林的党——苏联人民在争取共产主义胜利斗争中的鼓舞者和组织者》，《共产主义的伟大建设——苏维埃社会威力的显著证据》，《斯大林同志——粉碎列宁格勒附近德国法西斯军队的鼓舞者和组织者》等等。这里进行了党委会讲演者的全省讨论会，参加者都得到关于在选民之间进行群众政治工作的任务的指导。党的省委会派了大批讲演者到各区去做关于选举运动的报告。由于加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃的选举，其他许多党的省委会也派了许多讲演者和报告者到区中去。
    在许多省中，讲演局和政治及科学知识普及协会分会都积极参加了选举运动。它们制订出讲题目录和讲稿分送各区，分派讲演者到各选区，组织协会会员到农村给选民讲演。
    在没有党的有系统的监督的地方，讲演工作计划就时常充满着一些偶然的、次要的题材，失掉了目的性。这种情形尤其是在乌克兰西部几省的农村居民之间的讲演工作，表现得更明显。这些省份中的农民，走上新的、集体农场的发展道路还比较不久，对集体农场建设的各种问题特别注意。然而这些需要却远不能得到满足。乌克兰西部一些省中，很少举办给集体农场领导干部的讲演会。在各大村庄中，也很少关于布尔什维克党土地政策、农业集体化、乌克兰共和国西部各省城市及农村社会主义改造的讲演。关于斯大林的农业劳动组合章程，也宣传得不够。
    在讲演宣传中，考虑劳动者各方面的兴趣和需要，有区别地对待各不同阶层的居民，都是很重要的。在许多地方为父母们组织了关于苏联教育学问题的讲演。青年团委员会的讲演者团体专门给青年们组织了讲演会。
    劳动者对进行讲演工作组织的要求，不断增长着。在许多情况下，一般的讲演已经不能满足听众了，他们要求深刻地研究这一个或那一个问题。为了适应群众的需要，协会的分会和讲演局组织了最不同的各问题的循环讲演。在许多城市（莫斯科、列宁格勒、高尔基、古比雪夫等），举办着关于联共（布）历史、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、政治经济学、马列主义的美学等讲演。在某些省中，举办了关于米邱林生物学的循环讲演。
    循环讲演是很流行的；最好各地都进行才好。
    对于讲演的思想内容的监督，是党领导讲演宣传最重要的一件事。只有在党的有步骤的监督之下，才能保证讲演的高度思想理论水平，才能铲除这方面的缺点。
    例如，关于国际问题的讲演。拥护和平事业的苏维埃人，对国际情况表现有特殊的兴趣。从事讲演宣传的组织，在以很好的国际问题讲演满足苏维埃人的要求方面，做了不少的工作。但是，有时这些题目的讲演是浮表的，常常是事实和事件的简单罗列。在某些讲演中，缺乏对国际关系及其发展远景的深刻分析，对苏联在解决国际问题方面的作用和意义也表示得不够。在关于国际问题的讲演中，特别重要地是强调指出帝国主义阵营矛盾的尖锐化，指出和平、民主与社会主义阵营的强大以及反帝阵营的主要领导力量——苏联的影响和权威。
    加强对国际问题讲演者工作质量的监督并组织给他们以有权能的帮助，党委会就能铲除讲演中的缺点。
    讲演的水平，主要决定于讲演者的成份。为讲演的高等质量而斗争——就是说首先要正确地选择并有系统地教育讲演干部。对政治和科学知识普及协会分会的工作，应该寄与严格的注意，提高各分会在争取讲演质量斗争中的作用，组织对讲演稿真正批评性质的讨论，在评价中不容许产生自由主义。某些省委会宣传鼓动部，在组织对讲演稿的批评讨论方面的经验，是值得珍贵的。
    在许多省份中，党委会都举办了各种题目的讲演者的讨论会。这些讨论会的工作如果组织得正确，那么在提高讲演的思想理论水平方面，就会表现出巨大的影响。在讨论会中，对某一讲演保证有热烈的讨论和分析，交换工作经验，均是异常重要的。可以举在拉脱维亚举办的共和国讲演者讨论会为例，会上讨论的是以《苏维埃民主及其较资产阶级民主的优越性》为题的演说。讨论会的参加者关于讲演的内容和材料讲解的形式都提出了许多宝贵的意见。此外在讲演者的讨论会上，也要报告给他们党和政府最重要的决议和党组织面前的经济政治任务。
    在党委会中，讲演宣传问题的讨论，给讲演质量以严重的影响。一九五○年，这些问题曾在阿塞尔拜疆共产党（布）中央委员会的一次全会中讨论过。全会揭露出讲演工作的组织及内容中的一些严重缺点并指出改善的广泛纲领。关于讲演工作情况问题，随即在共和国中各省委会、大多数市委会及区委会中展开讨论。乌克兰的党组织，也有系统地从事讲演工作的内容及组织问题，尤其是在基辅、维尼茨、奥得萨各省。乌克兰共产党（布）中央，曾屡次讨论了改善群众中讲演工作的方法。
    然而许多党组织还仍然没有深入讲演宣传的实质，不争取讲演的高等质量。例如在卡查赫苏维埃社会主义共和国讲演宣传就组织得不好，该共和国没有组织对共和国政治及科学普及协会中的讲演质量的监督。协会分会很少召集讲演者，讲演稿也不讨论，时常找一些很少素养的人来做讲演。在里沃夫省对讲演质量的监督也是不能令人满意，在政治和科学知识普及协会里沃夫分会讲演者的会议上，讲演稿的分析和讨论常是形式上的，没有很好的批评。
    有一些党委会以想出来的运动方式来代替对讲演宣传的质量的系统监督。例如，党的托姆斯基省委会常会提出进行竞赛最好的讲演。这种空洞的有毒的想法，和真正的布尔什维克的领导群众政治工作的方法，没有丝毫相同之处。党委会的责任，是保证每一讲演能充分负起劳动者共产主义教育的任务，保证每一讲演是科学的，内容明确，形式容易被接受的。欲达到这一目的，是不能用类似竞赛的空想的方法，而要对宣传员干部的思想政治教育和方法培养上给以坚持的注意的工作，并建立党对讲演宣传质量的系统监督。
    不能轻视讲演的形式，可惜我们还时常发生这种情形，善于利用地方生活中的事实，能够帮助讲演的效力。例子和文学中的形象可以使讲演生动活泼起来。在讲演者的讨论会上一方面讨论讲演的内容，同时也考虑形式和讲演工作的方法问题，是很有益处的。收集并总结对于讲演的反应，使讲演者考虑到听众的意见和劝告，是非常重要的。
    讲演宣传——是思想工作的一个战斗部分。党组织应做一切必须的工作，以使讲演宣传水平提高到能负起布尔什维克党所提出的要求。（君强译自苏联《布尔什维克》杂志一九五○年第二十四期）
