Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 17th:

The spokesman for the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army recently issued a statement regarding the barbaric atrocities of the U.S. invading army in massacring captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and innocent Korean people in Jungseori, Gacheon County, South Pyongan Province, Korea. The statement said: When troops of the U.S. invading army's Second Division fled from Jungseori, Gacheon County, at 4:00 PM on December 1st of last year, they collectively and cruelly murdered 31 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and 35 innocent Korean people with machine guns. All those killed had paper tags reading "Prisoner of War" hung on their chests. This is yet another atrocity committed by the U.S. military in Korea after countless inhumane crimes.

The spokesman continued: The act of killing prisoners of war is not only unpardonable by humanity and justice but is also expressly prohibited by international law.

This atrocity of the U.S. military once again exposes the inhumane nature and disregard for international law of U.S. imperialism. Linking this crime with the U.S. military's continued bombing, burning, and killing in Korea, it is not difficult to conclude that the war waged by the U.S. military in Korea is an aggressive war attempting to turn Korea into a colony. They treat the people of Korea and other invaded countries as objects that can be slaughtered at will. When the war of aggression fails due to the tenacious resistance of the people, a sense of terror arises among the aggressors. This emotion drives them to adopt desperate and brutal acts. Similar situations occurred when the Hitler gang and Japanese aggressors faced their final destruction.

The spokesman then addressed the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' treatment of prisoners of war: Our army adopts a humane and lenient policy towards all prisoners of war. We do not beat, scold, kill, or insult their dignity, and we never search their personal belongings. Even in the most difficult supply situations, we provide prisoners of war with the same food as our own troops and treat the wounded and sick. We have also decided to release some prisoners of war. Last November, we released the first batch of 103 American prisoners of war. News agencies around the world have reported this. Our army's policy towards prisoners of war is determined by the just and anti-aggression nature of the war we are waging. We clearly know that the soldiers of the U.S. military and the Lee Seung-man army do not need war. They are merely forced to act as tools of aggression due to the oppression of American financial groups and warlords. The culprits who launched the war are not them but a small group of monopoly capitalists and warlords on Wall Street. The soldiers themselves are also oppressed. Our anti-aggression war is not only for the independence and liberation of Korea but also to save those oppressed soldiers and all humanity from the disaster of war.

The spokesman concluded: The Hitler gang and Japanese aggressors could not escape the responsibility for the crimes they committed. The American aggressors who have committed the above or other crimes will also receive the punishment they deserve. All the crimes committed by the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man gang have been registered and are continuing to be investigated. The people must demand blood debts from the heads of these criminals.

　　美军残杀朝鲜人民和我志愿军被俘人员        
    朝人民军总部发言人痛予谴责        
    美李匪帮罪行正登记调查中，罪犯头子定受严惩。
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令部发言人最近就美国侵略军在朝鲜平安南道价川郡中西里杀害朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军被俘人员的野蛮暴行，发表声明称：美国侵略军第二师所属部队于去年十二月一日午后四时，从价川郡中西里逃窜时，曾以机枪将中国人民志愿军的被俘人员三十一名与无辜的朝鲜人民三十五名集体惨杀。在那些被杀害的人们的胸前都挂有“战争俘虏”的纸片。这是侵朝美军犯了无数次非人道罪行之后的又一次暴行。
    发言人继称：杀害战俘的行为不仅为人道和正义所不能宽恕，而且为国际公法明文所禁止。
    美军的这种暴行，再一次地暴露了美帝国主义残无人道、漠视国际公法的事实。把这种罪行与美军在朝鲜继续施行的滥炸烧杀等罪状联系起来，我们就不难得出结论：即美军在朝鲜进行的战争，是企图将朝鲜变成殖民地的一种侵略战争。他们把朝鲜与其他被侵略国家的人民当成可以任意屠杀的对象。当侵略战争因遭到人民的顽强抵抗而失败时，侵略者中就产生了一种恐怖的情绪。这情绪更使他们采用了绝望的残暴行为。在希特勒匪帮与日本侵略者面临最后灭亡时，曾经发生过类似的情形。
    发言人继就朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军对待战俘的情形称：我军对一切战争俘虏采取人道的宽大政策。不打，不骂，不杀，不侮辱人格，而且从不搜查属于私人的物品。即使在供给最困难的情形下，也以与我军同样的食物给与战俘，并为伤、病者治疗。同时决定对部分战俘予以释放。去年十一月，曾释放了第一批美国战俘一百零三名。各国通讯社对此都曾报道。我军这种对待战俘的政策，是由于我们所从事的战争的正义和反侵略的性质而决定的。我们清楚地知道：美军和李承晚军队的士兵绝不需要战争。他们不过是因受美国财阀和军阀压迫而被迫充当侵略工具而已。发动战争的罪魁并不是他们，而是华尔街的一小撮独占资本家和军阀。士兵本身也是被压迫者。我们的反侵略战争不仅是为了朝鲜的独立、解放，同时也是为了使那些被压迫的士兵和全人类免于战争的灾难。
    发言人最后称：希特勒匪帮与日本侵略者并不能逃避因他们所犯的罪行而应负的责任。犯有上述或其他罪行的美国侵略者，也将受到应受的惩罚。美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮所犯的一切罪行已予登记，并在继续调查中。人民必须向这些罪犯的头子们讨还血债。
