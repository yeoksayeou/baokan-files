    The Invincible Soviet Army
    The Soviet Army is an invincible army in the world. Stalin pointed out that the Soviet army has three characteristics: it is an army of liberated workers and peasants, an army defending the freedom and independence of the Soviet nationalities, and an army cultivated with the spirit of internationalism. The Soviet army, with these characteristics, has a high degree of political consciousness, knows why it fights, and has a strong rear and countless friends and allies all over the world. This guarantees that this army will become an invincible force.
    The Soviet army was born and grew up in combat. On February 23, 1918, the young Red Army of workers and peasants in Petrograd defeated the German imperialist interventionists near Pskov and Narva. In order to commemorate this battle, this day was designated as the Soviet Army Day. From 1918 to 1920, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Red Army, with its high degree of heroism, repelled the intervention armies of fourteen capitalist countries and the reactionary White bandit army at home. This new type of army grew stronger in combat and became an unshakable force defending socialist peaceful construction.
    In the era of peaceful construction, the Soviet Union's national strength grew at an unprecedented rate. During the three five-year plans from 1928 to 1941, the Soviet Union had become a powerful country with advanced industry and prosperous socialist agriculture. By the eve of the Great Patriotic War, the total output of Soviet heavy industry had exceeded the pre-revolutionary industrial level by 11.7 times, the machine manufacturing and metal processing industry by more than 41 times, and the non-ferrous metals by more than 82 times. On this basis, the Soviet Union's defense forces underwent a fundamental technical transformation. From 1930 to 1939, the number of Soviet tanks increased by 43 times, aircraft by 6.5 times, artillery by 7 times, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns by 70 times, machine guns by 5.5 times, and naval tonnage increased by 2.3 times. Under Stalin's education, new military cadres continued to emerge. At this time, the Soviet army was already a modern army with high combat quality, excellent commanders, and full technical equipment.
    In July 1938, Japanese imperialists invaded the Soviet Union at Zhanggufeng. In May 1939, the Japanese invaders again attempted to attack the Mongolian People's Republic in the Nomonhan area in an attempt to invade the Soviet Union. Both were met with strong blows by the Soviet army, and the war ended with the shameful defeat of the invaders.
    In June 1941, fascist Germany perfidiously launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union thus began the Great Patriotic War. During the four-year war, the Soviet army achieved world-shaking feats and won a historic and great victory in the stages of defense, counter-offensive, and defeat of the enemy.
    At the beginning of the war, Hitler concentrated a superior force of 170 divisions and brazenly invaded the heartland of the European part of the Soviet Union. In its active defense, the Soviet army made the German invaders pay a heavy price in casualties. In the first two months of the war alone, the German invaders lost 2 million soldiers, 8,000 tanks, 10,000 artillery pieces, and 7,200 aircraft. By the beginning of November 1941, the German invaders had suffered 4.5 million casualties. In the first stage of the war, that is, the period up to the autumn of 1942, the active defense of the Soviet army had completely shattered the fascist "blitzkrieg" tactics.
    In the winter of 1942, the Soviet army launched a great counter-offensive after months of great defense in Stalingrad, encircling and annihilating 22 elite tank divisions of the German invaders, totaling 330,000 people. In 1943, the Soviet army advanced another 1,700 kilometers in the autumn and winter offensives, completely destroying the German invaders' defense system along the entire Dnieper River, and by November had liberated more than two-thirds of the occupied territory.
    In the battles of 1944, the Soviet army gave the invaders ten powerful blows, annihilating 120 divisions of the German invaders and their vassal state armies, pushing the war beyond the borders. In this year, the Soviet army not only completely liberated Ukraine and Crimea, but also liberated most of the territories of Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia.
    In January 1945, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive on a vast front of 1,200 kilometers from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains, with 150 divisions and a large number of artillery and air force, successively destroying the German invaders' East Prussia, the central line of defense from the Vistula River to Berlin, and all the fortifications of the Danube defense line, liberating Warsaw, Budapest, and Vienna. On April 16, the Soviet army launched an attack with 6,300 new heavy tanks, 41,000 artillery pieces and mortars, and 8,400 aircraft, capturing Berlin in one fell swoop and destroying the fascist nest.
    On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union fulfilled its treaty with the Allied countries and declared war on Japanese fascism. The Soviet army swiftly destroyed the elite Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism with thunderous force. From August 9 to September 9, a total of 674,000 Japanese troops were eliminated.
    In total, the Soviet army eliminated more than 12 million German and Japanese troops in the anti-fascist war.
    The victory of the Soviet army brilliantly proved the inevitable victory of the just war, and also proved that the Soviet Union had the military strength to determine the war. The victory of the Soviet army saved human civilization and its future from fascist disaster, which is an immortal contribution of the Soviet armed forces to human history.
    In the post-war years, the Soviet army dedicated itself to the noble cause of defending peace, vigilantly guarding against the war-mongers' conspiracy to incite a new war. After the successful completion of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan, its national strength was further enhanced. In 1950, the total industrial output had exceeded the 1940 level by more than 70 percent. The strength of the Soviet army has become a reliable guarantee for world peace.

### 举世无敌的苏联军队

　　举世无敌的苏联军队
    苏联军队是一支举世无敌的军队。斯大林曾指出苏军有三个特点：它是解放了的工农的军队，是保卫苏联各民族的自由与独立的军队，是用国际主义精神培养起来的军队。具有这些特点的苏联军队，有着高度的政治觉悟，知道为何作战，并且拥有坚强的后方和全世界无数的朋友和同盟者，这就保证了这支军队成为不可战胜的力量。
    苏联军队是从战斗里诞生和成长起来的。一九一八年二月二十三日，彼得格勒年青的工农红军在普斯可夫和纳尔瓦附近击败德帝国主义干涉者，为了纪念这一战役，就把这个日子定为苏联建军节。从一九一八年到一九二○年，在列宁和斯大林的领导下，红军以高度的英雄主义击退了十四个资本主义国家的干涉军和国内反动的白匪军。这支新型的军队就在战斗中壮大起来，成为捍卫社会主义和平建设的不可动摇的力量。
    在和平建设年代，苏联国力以空前的速度增长着。在从一九二八年到一九四一年的三届五年计划期间，苏联已变成了一个具有先进的工业和繁荣的社会主义农业的强国。到卫国战争前夕，苏联重工业的总产量超过了革命前工业水平的十一点七倍，机器制造业和金属加工业超过四十一倍，辗金属超过八十二倍。在这样的基础上，苏联的国防力量进行了技术上的根本改造，从一九三○年到一九三九年的期间，苏军的坦克增加了四十三倍，飞机六倍半，大炮七倍，战防炮和反坦克枪七十倍，机枪五倍半，海军吨位增加二点三倍。在斯大林的教育下新的军事干部不断涌现出来，这时苏军已是一支具有高度战斗质量，有着卓越的指挥人员和充分的技术装备的现代化军队了。
    一九三八年七月日本帝国主义者在张鼓峰进犯苏联，一九三九年五月间日寇又在诺门坎地区企图进攻蒙古人民共和国以进犯苏联，都遭到苏军的强大打击，战争都以侵略者可耻的失败收场。
    一九四一年六月，法西斯德国背信弃义地向苏联发动了突然性的进攻，苏联由此开始了伟大的保卫祖国的战争。在四年战争期间，苏军从防御、反攻到击溃敌人的诸阶段上，造成了震惊世界的赫赫战绩，获得了历史性的伟大胜利。
    战争开始时，希特勒曾集中了一百七十个师的优势兵力，蠢然进犯到苏联欧洲部分的腹地。苏军在积极的防御中使德寇付出了重大的伤亡代价。仅在战争的头两月中，德寇即损失了兵员二百万人，坦克八千辆，大炮一万门，飞机七千二百架。到一九四一年十一月初，德寇已伤亡了四百五十万人。在战争的第一阶段，即到一九四二年秋季为止的时期，苏军的积极防御已完全粉碎了法西斯的“闪击”战术。
    一九四二年冬，苏军在斯大林格勒进行了历时数月的伟大的保卫战后进入大反攻，一举包围全歼德寇二十二个精锐的坦克师共三十三万人。在一九四三年，苏军在秋季和冬季攻势中又前进了一千七百公里，彻底摧毁了德寇在整个第聂伯河的防御体系，到十一月间便解放了三分之二以上沦陷的国土。
    在一九四四年的历次战役中，苏军给了侵略者十次强大的打击，歼灭德寇及其附庸国军队一百二十个师，将战争推到国境以外去。这一年苏军不仅完全解放了乌克兰和克里米亚，并且解放了捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利和南斯拉夫的大部国土。
    一九四五年一月，苏军在由波罗的海到喀尔巴阡山的一千二百公里的广阔战线上，以一百五十个师和大量的炮兵和空军展开了大攻势，接连摧毁了德寇东普鲁士、从维斯杜拉河到柏林的中央防线和多瑙河防线的一切坚固工事，解放了华沙、布达佩斯和维也纳。四月十六日，苏军以六千三百辆新型重坦克、四万一千门大炮和迫击炮以及八千四百架飞机投入战斗，一举攻克柏林，摧毁了法西斯的巢穴。
    一九四五年八月九日，苏联履行同盟国的条约，对日本法西斯宣战。苏军以雷霆万钧之势，迅速摧毁了日本帝国主义的精锐的关东军。从八月九日到九月九日，共消灭日军六十七万四千人。
    总计苏军在反法西斯战争中共消灭德日军队在一千二百万人以上。
    苏军的胜利辉煌地证明了正义战争的必然胜利，也证明了苏联具有决定战争的军事力量。苏军的胜利挽救了人类的文明及其未来免于法西斯灾难，这是苏联武装力量对人类历史的不朽贡献。
    在战后年代，苏联军队把自己奉献给崇高的捍卫和平的事业，警惕着战争贩子煽起新战争的阴谋。苏联战后五年计划胜利完成后，国力更为增强了，一九五○年工业总产量已超过一九四○年水平的百分之七十以上。苏联军队的强大已成为世界和平的可靠的保障。
