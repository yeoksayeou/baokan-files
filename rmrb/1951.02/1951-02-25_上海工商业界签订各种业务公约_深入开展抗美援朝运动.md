Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 23rd: The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country Movement in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles has entered a new stage. Various industry associations are signing various business pacts based on the unified patriotic covenant, combined with the characteristics of their respective industries. The various industries dealing with essential daily necessities guarantee in their signed pacts that they will earnestly abide by the market transaction system. The covenant signed by the cotton textile industry mainly focuses on resolutely implementing the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on the unified purchase of cotton yarn, prohibiting false purchases and hoarding for speculation. Violators will be punished by suspending yarn allocation and suspending membership rights for a certain period. Industries engaged in processing orders for state-owned enterprises or government agencies and military units focus on completing tasks on schedule and ensuring no shoddy workmanship in their signed covenants. The hotel industry stipulates in its covenant that it will assist public security organs in preventing espionage and suppressing theft. Various industries have also included content in their covenants to guarantee the completion of tax payment tasks, according to their respective circumstances. Industries with serious tax evasion problems adopt "correct declaration of business volume" as a code of conduct; industries with conditions to implement an invoice system stipulate in their covenants that they will implement a unified invoice system. Some industries' business covenants stipulate the promotion of domestic goods and the rejection of American goods. For example, the covenants of the electrical equipment and shipbuilding industries, which have always relied on foreign raw materials, stipulate: "Do not use American goods for which domestic substitutes are already available." This promotes factories manufacturing these goods to actively improve the quality of finished products. Many industries stipulate in their business covenants the abolition of old, feudalistic malpractices and the promotion of honest business practices. This promotes business reforms in these industries. For example, the fruit and local produce industry had been brewing the issue of abolishing foreign commissions for half a year without a solution, but it was successfully achieved after signing the covenant. This is beneficial to the exchange of native products. Furthermore, industries such as wool yarn, native cloth, and Western clothing often have long-standing habits such as changing brands and names, and shortening sizes. These habits have decreased after signing the covenant.

The implementation of business covenants by Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles has been underway for more than a month. As of now, 210 of the city's 274 trade associations have signed business covenants. More than a month of experience has proven that promoting business covenants is an effective way to further promote the practice of patriotic covenants. Currently, activists in individual industries have been able to grasp the covenant as a tool for uniting and educating their peers. For example, the machine industry and handkerchief weaving industry have held meetings to review violations such as shoddy workmanship and tax evasion that have occurred within their respective industries.

The experience of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles in implementing business covenants for more than a month has also proven that the greater the effect of a covenant, the better it is to combine the specific tasks and characteristics of the industry. For example, in terms of guaranteeing tax payment and clearing tax arrears, as of the end of January, about 86 percent of the old tax arrears of the city's industrial and commercial taxes before May last year have been cleared, and new arrears after May account for only 0.87 percent of the taxes paid into the treasury.

Recently, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce will launch an inspection of the implementation of the covenants by the industries that have signed them, so as to appropriately revise the covenants that are not appropriately drafted. At the same time, the committee will continue to promote the universal signing of business covenants by industries that have not yet signed them, so as to enable the city's industrial and commercial households to take universal action and practice patriotic covenants.

　　上海工商业界签订各种业务公约
    深入开展抗美援朝运动
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海市工商界抗美援朝保家卫国运动已进入一个新阶段，各行业公会正根据统一的爱国公约结合本业业务的特点签订各种业务公约。主要民生日用品各业在所订公约中保证切实遵守市场交易制度。棉纺业所订公约以坚决执行中央人民政府政务院统购棉纱的决定为主要内容，不许冒名套购，囤积居奇，违约者给予停止配纱及停止享受会员权利若干时期的处分。为国营企业或机关、部队作加工定货活的各业，所订公约以如期完成任务及保证不偷工减料为重点。旅馆业在公约中规定了要协助公安机关防特缉盗。各行业也根据各自不同情况在公约中规定了保证完成纳税任务的内容。偷漏税较严重的行业以“正确申报营业额”为守则；有条件实行发票制的行业就在公约上规定要实行统一的发票制。有些行业的业务公约规定了提倡国货，拒用美货的条文。如过去一向依赖国外原料的电工器材、造船工业等行业的公约中便规定：“不用已有国货代用品的美货”。这就推动了制造这些货品的工厂要积极提高成品质量。许多行业在业务公约中规定取消旧的带有封建性的陋规，提倡诚实经营。这就推动了这些行业的业务改革。如水果地货业对取消外佣问题已酝酿半年而没有解决，但在这次订约后就顺利实现了。这对土产交流是有利的。再如绒线、土布、西服业等行业常有改牌换名、缩短尺码等积习。订约后这些积习已经减少。
    上海市工商界推行业务公约已有一个多月。截至目前为止，全市二百七十四个同业公会中已有二百一十个签订了业务公约。一个多月的经验证明，推行业务公约是进一步推动实践爱国公约的有效办法。目前个别行业的积极分子已能掌握公约，作为对同业进行团结教育的工具。如机器工业、手帕织造业等都曾开会检讨本业内发生的偷工减料、逃税等违约事件。
    上海市工商界一个多月来执行业务公约的经验也证明：凡所订公约能很好结合本业具体任务与特点的收效便大。如在保证纳税和清缴欠税方面，截至一月底止，全市工商业税去年五月以前的旧欠已清缴了约百分之八十六，五月以后新欠只占已纳库税款的百分之零点八七。
    最近上海市工商业联合会筹备会将发动已订约的各行业检查执行公约的情况，以便适当修正订得不适当的公约。同时，该会将继续推动尚未订约的行业普遍签订业务公约，以便使全市工商业户普遍行动起来，实践爱国公约。
