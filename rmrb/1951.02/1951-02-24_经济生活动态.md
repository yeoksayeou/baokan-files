The First Batch of Land Reform Completed in Guanzhong Area, Shaanxi

    The first phase of land reform in 824 villages in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, which began in October last year and ended in mid-January this year, has been completed successively. According to statistics from 448 of these villages, 55% of the poor and hired peasants and a small number of middle peasants who lacked land or had little land were allocated land. Each poor and hired peasant was able to receive an average of more than 1.3 mu of land. Including the original land, each person now possesses an average of 1.5 to 2 mu of land, equivalent to 75% of the average land possessed by each peasant in the local area. Considering the situation in Guanzhong, where there is little land and a dense population, and the land is scattered, the peasants' land requirements have been appropriately met. Now, the second phase of land reform in the Guanzhong area has begun in late January. A total of more than 1,270 villages need to implement land reform, which is a larger scale than the previous one. It is estimated that it will be completed in March.

Guangdong Completes Autumn Grain Collection and Transitions to Land Reform

    Since the autumn grain collection in Guangdong Province began in November last year, the central grain task of the annual agricultural tax was completed by January 5 this year. Among them, the Yuezhong Special Zone had the best performance, completing 103.66% (including local surcharges). The South China Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held the Second Guangdong Land Reform Conference from January 11 to 21, discussing the specific implementation plan for land reform, adopting "steady acceleration" as the guiding principle for land reform in Guangdong Province, and striving to complete land reform in most areas before the spring plowing so that all efforts can be turned to spring plowing production.

Gao Guantou Sets This Year's Production Increase Plan

    Gao Guantou, a famous agricultural labor model in Shenxian County, Hebei, has become even more enthusiastic about production since attending the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. While summarizing his production achievements and experiences last year, he formulated this year's production increase plan. This year, he plans to increase grain production by 5,000 jin and plant five more mu of cotton fields than last year. He is also preparing to lead the mutual aid group to finalize this year's production plan soon. Under his leadership, more than 40 old farmers in Dashujiazhuang Village, Shenxian County, Hebei, have formulated production increase plans.

Suxian and Lingbi Select Huai River Harnessing Models

    After the winter Huai River harnessing project came to an end, Suxian, Lingbi and other places successively held model evaluation meetings last month. In Suxian, 32 people, including Li Lingxin and Liu Jiyu, were named heroes in harnessing the Huai River. Du Zhenyu of Lingbi was elected as a first-class model, Li Chunguo, Cui Sibao, and Zhao Qihou were elected as second-class models, and Zhang Zhongping, Shen Guanghui, Chai Jiasheng, and Chen Tan were elected as third-class models. These heroes and models were selected from all aspects of the Huai River harnessing project.

Spring Afforestation Begins in Various Parts of Central and South China

    This year, the Central and South China region will focus on building sand-fixing forests in the Yellow River flooded area in eastern Henan Province and water source forests in the upper reaches of the Huai River for afforestation. Secondly, afforestation will also be carried out in a planned manner this year along the major rivers such as the Hanshui River basin, the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi Province, the Yuanjiang River in Hunan Province, and the Dongjiang River in Guangdong Province. At present, 300,000 jin of various types of tree seeds have been prepared in various parts of the Central and South China region. Recently, the weather has gradually warmed up and the land has begun to thaw. Under the assistance and technical guidance of local forestry institutions and forest farms, local farmers have begun afforestation. Farmers in Weishi County, Henan, have now built seven sand-fixing forest networks and planted more than 70,000 trees. Farmers in Suixian County have also planted 250,000 trees.
