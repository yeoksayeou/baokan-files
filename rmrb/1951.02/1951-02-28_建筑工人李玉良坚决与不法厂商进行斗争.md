　　Construction Worker Li Yuliang Resolutely Fights Against Illegal Manufacturers
    Editor:
    Li Yuliang, a member of the 10th Branch of the Beijing Construction Workers' Union, is conscientious and responsible in protecting the people's property, demonstrating the excellent qualities of the working class.
    Last July, Li Yuliang was hired as a temporary carpenter by the Beijing Private Jianxing Construction Factory. When the factory contracted to repair the doors and windows of the houses at Jing'er Hutong owned by the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, Li Yuliang discovered that the contractor was ordering workers to secretly saw off the pads and purlins of the houses. Li Yuliang resolutely opposed this theft and destruction, and immediately criticized the factory manager, Zhang Guirong. Zhang Guirong completely ignored him and continued to order workers to secretly saw wood, and hid the sawn timber. Li Yuliang then reported the matter to the 10th District Union Office. At the same time, the illegal manufacturer Zhang Guirong, seeing that Li Yuliang was very determined, transferred him to another job in order to continue the theft. Two days later, Li Yuliang was dismissed.
    Although Li Yuliang was dismissed, he did not stop fighting against Zhang Guirong's illegal act of destroying state property. He again reported the matter to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions through the District Union Office. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions investigated the matter and suggested that the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters handle it. However, Wang Anjiu, the deputy section chief of the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters, was ideologically paralyzed and did not pay attention to it. Later, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, together with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, conducted another investigation and informed the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters of the investigation and handling opinions on October 24, but the team delayed and was perfunctory after accepting the opinions, and did not handle it in a timely manner.
    Seeing that the matter had been delayed for five months without results, Li Yuliang wrote letters to the Central People's Supervisory Committee and the People's Daily in early December. The People's Daily published his letter on December 23. The Central People's Supervisory Committee also dealt with the matter, and finally, on January 22, the illegal manufacturer Zhang Guirong was sentenced to five years in prison by the Beijing People's Court after trial, and was ordered to pay 20 million yuan in compensation for the loss of destroyed building timber.
    Li Yuliang insisted on principles and carried out unremitting struggle against illegal acts that harmed the interests of the people. With the support of the trade union and the People's Government, he finally achieved victory and the illegal contractor received the punishment he deserved. Li Yuliang's high degree of responsibility to the people's cause is worthy of our study. At the same time, the Beijing People's Court decided when sentencing Zhang Guirong that the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters should extract a portion of Zhang Guirong's compensation as a reward for Li Yuliang, which is also entirely appropriate; however, the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters has not yet fulfilled this obligation. I think the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters has consistently demonstrated an intolerable bureaucratic attitude in dealing with this issue; compared with the worker Li Yuliang's responsible attitude towards the people's cause, they should consciously conduct a review.

### 建筑工人李玉良坚决与不法厂商进行斗争

　　建筑工人李玉良坚决与不法厂商进行斗争
    编辑同志：
    北京市建筑业工会第十区分会会员建筑工人李玉良，认真负责保护人民财产，表现了工人阶级的优良品质。
    去年七月，李玉良被北京私营建兴营造厂雇作临时木工。当该厂包修中央人民政府卫生部防疫总队所有本市井儿胡同房屋的门窗时，李玉良发现该包工商人令工人偷锯房上的垫板和檩方。李玉良坚决反对这种偷盗破坏行为，即向该厂经理张贵荣提出批评。而张贵荣完全不理，继续令工人偷锯木料，并将已锯下的拉回藏匿起来。李玉良遂又将此事报告给十区工会办事处。同时，不法厂商张贵荣见李玉良心意十分坚决，就把他调到别处工作，以便于继续进行偷盗。两天后，李玉良复遭到解雇。
    李玉良虽被解雇，对张贵荣这种非法破坏国家财产的罪恶行为，并未中止斗争。他又经过区工会办事处把这事反映到市总工会。市总工会对此事作了调查，并建议防疫总队进行处理。而防疫总队副科长王安九思想麻痹，对此不加重视。后经北京市人民政府劳动局会同市总工会再度调查，并在十月二十四日把调查情况及处理意见告知防疫总队，但该队在接受意见后，仍拖延马虎，不及时处理。
    李玉良见此事拖延了五个月未有结果，十二月上旬，他又分别写信给中央人民监察委员会和人民日报。人民日报于十二月二十三日发表了他的信。中央人民监察委员会也对此事进行了处理，终将不法厂商张贵荣于一月二十二日经北京市人民法院审理后，判处徒刑五年，并赔偿破坏建筑木料损失费二千万元。
    李玉良坚持原则和损害人民利益的违法行为进行不懈的斗争，在工会和人民政府的支持下，终于得到胜利，而使不法包工商受到了应有的惩罚。李玉良这种高度对人民事业负责的精神，是值得我们学习的。同时，北京市人民法院在判决张贵荣案件时，曾决定防疫总队应从张贵荣的赔款中提出一部分，作为对李玉良的奖励，这也是完全应该的；但防疫总队至今仍未履行此项义务，我觉得防疫总队在对待这一问题上，始终表现了令人难以容忍的官僚主义态度；这和工人李玉良对人民事业的负责态度相比之下，他们应该自觉地进行检讨。
