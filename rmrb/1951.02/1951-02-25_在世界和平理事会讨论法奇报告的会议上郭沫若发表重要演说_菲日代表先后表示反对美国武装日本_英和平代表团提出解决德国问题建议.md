Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 24th: According to TASS, the World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd, chaired by World Peace Council Executive Bureau Vice-Chairman D'Arboussier. The meeting discussed the report by World Peace Council Executive Bureau member Farge on the remilitarization of Germany and Japan.

	British Quaker Pitby spoke as a guest, saying, "I have been deeply impressed by the participants' sincere preparation to dispel the clouds hanging over humanity with concerted efforts and their willingness to cooperate with all those who wholeheartedly want to achieve this goal."

	Hungarian Reformed Church Bishop Janos then spoke, saying that the Hungarian people regard the World Peace Council as the defender of the freedom, independence, and peace of all nations, and they are ready to accept the World Peace Council's instructions on new tasks. After the Warsaw Congress, the Hungarian delegates returned home and reported on the work and resolutions of the congress in more than seventy cities. Janos then pointed out that even after the Warsaw Peace Congress made its recommendations, the United Nations had intensified its transformation into a tool of imperialism. The Hungarian people and all peace-loving people in the world deeply regret this. The United Nations itself has destroyed all the hopes that the people of all countries had placed in it since its establishment, which only makes peace-loving people turn their hopes to the World Peace Council. Janos, on behalf of the Hungarian people, said: I ask the World Peace Council to continue its work without hesitation in order to strengthen and develop peaceful cooperation between all countries. Thanks to the clear and profound statement by Marshal Stalin, the movement to defend peace has become even stronger.

	Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council Executive Bureau, then delivered a lengthy speech, which was welcomed by delegates from various countries.

	Those who spoke at the afternoon meeting also included Japanese Professor Ikuo Oyama, Spanish writer Bergamin, and Soviet writer Ehrenburg.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 24th: At the World Peace Council meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, and Japanese representative Ikuo Oyama delivered speeches successively, which were warmly welcomed by delegates from various countries.

	Guo Moruo's speech lasted forty minutes, and the hall resounded with stormy applause. The "People's Pictorial," "Chinese Workers' Pictorial," and other pictures brought by the Chinese delegation for distribution to the delegates were treasured by the delegates from various countries. Many delegates were proud to wear badges with Chairman Mao's image on their chests.

	Japanese representative Ikuo Oyama delivered a speech on behalf of the Japanese people, saying, "I overcame many difficulties to come here as the first Japanese to participate in an international democratic conference. This fact shows the Japanese people's determination to resolutely struggle against US imperialism's restoration of Japanese militarism." Oyama Ikuo recounted the situation of the United States remilitarizing and colonizing Japan and the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence. He then said: "We, the Japanese people, believe that there are ways to solve the Japanese problem peacefully, namely: First, to promptly conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan based on the Potsdam Proclamation, the Cairo Declaration, and the Yalta Agreement, and it must have the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China; Second, to withdraw all occupying forces from Japan within a certain period after the signing of such a treaty; Third, to abolish the ban on Japan's development of a peaceful economy, eliminate its war potential, and abolish the ban on Japan's trade with the Soviet Union, China, and Korea; Fourth, to denounce all activities preparing to conclude an aggressive Pacific Pact."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd: At the World Peace Council meeting held on the morning of the 22nd, Philippine representative Cruz delivered a speech opposing US imperialism's rearmament of Japan and expressed the Philippine people's firm will to defend peace. Cruz said: Imperialism—mainly US imperialism—can only seize huge profits in the plunder of war, so they are always afraid of lasting peace. The Philippine people are extremely angry about the crimes of US imperialism in Korea, which surpassed the crimes of Japanese militarists and German fascists during World War II. The Philippines' economy is now subordinate to the US war plan, and the Philippines has been used as a US war base for aggression against Asia. However, although the United States uses intimidation to try to drag the Philippine people into a devastating war, the Philippine people love peace and cherish their national dignity. They have begun to realize that whether they can be saved depends entirely on themselves. Cruz continued: The US's restoration of Japanese militarism is precisely coordinated with its conspiracy to restore German fascism. Rearming Japan means making Japan a fortress for US imperialism's aggression against Asia. The vast Philippine people, like their Asian brothers, have expressed righteous anger at this imperialist conspiracy. Except for a small number of traitors headed by Quirino, the entire Philippine people firmly oppose the imperialist policy toward Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: According to TASS, London, February 22nd: The representatives of the Executive Committee of the British National Peace Committee, who are now in Berlin attending the World Peace Council, have been authorized by the committee to submit the following proposals for consideration and adoption by the World Peace Council: First, the Council should submit all issues related to the rearmament of Germany to the people of the world; Second, the Council should put forward concrete proposals for the peaceful resolution of all outstanding differences on the German question, not only based solely on the conditions put forward by the occupying powers, but also in free and open consultation and discussion with people from all walks of life in Germany; Third, a movement should be launched and an organization established to promote mutual visits and cultural exchanges between the people of Germany and other European countries, especially the people of Germany and Britain. The representatives of the British Peace Committee stated: "We further believe that a peaceful solution to the German question is only possible by changing the current decision to rearm Germany. We call on all peace-loving people to redouble their efforts to force members of parliament and social leaders to support the opposition to German militarization. The British Peace Committee has organized this movement in almost every locality."

　　在世界和平理事会讨论法奇报告的会议上
    郭沫若发表重要演说
    菲日代表先后表示反对美国武装日本
    英和平代表团提出解决德国问题建议
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会于二十二日下午继续开会，由世界和平理事会执行局副主席达波赛担任主席，讨论了世界和平理事会执行局委员法奇所作关于德国与日本重新军国主义化的报告。
    英国教友派教徒毕德以来宾资格发言称：“与会者诚意地准备以一致的努力拨散笼罩在人类头上的乌云，并愿意和一切全心全意想达到这一目标的人士合作，已给我以极为深刻的印象。”
    匈牙利改革教会主教雅诺斯继起发言称：匈牙利人民认为世界和平理事会是各国人民的自由独立与和平的捍卫者，他们准备接受世界和平理事会关于新任务的指示。在华沙大会之后，匈牙利代表团员返国后曾在七十多个城市报告了大会的工作与决议。雅诺斯继而指出：甚至在华沙和平大会作出建议之后，联合国仍变本加厉地变成帝国主义的工具。匈牙利人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民对此深感痛心。联合国自己毁灭了各国人民自它成立以来对它所抱有的一切希望，这只有更使爱好和平的各国人民把他们的希望转而寄托于世界和平理事会。雅诺斯代表匈牙利人民说：我要求世界和平理事会毫不犹豫地继续它的工作，以便加强和发展一切国家之间的和平合作。由于斯大林大元帅的明确而深刻的声明，保卫和平运动已变得更加强大了。
    中国代表团团长、世界和平理事会执行局副主席郭沫若继起发表了长篇演说，受到各国代表的欢迎。
    在下午会议中发言的尚有日本名教授大山郁夫，西班牙作家柏加曼，苏联作家爱伦堡。
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】在世界和平理事会二十二日下午会议上，中国代表团团长郭沫若、日本代表大山郁夫相继发表演说，受到各国代表的热烈欢迎。
    郭沫若的讲演历时四十分钟，会场上不断响起了暴风雨般的掌声。中国代表团携来分送各代表的《人民画报》、《中国工人画刊》及其他图片，均为各国代表所珍爱。许多代表都以胸前佩有毛主席纪念章为荣。
    日本代表大山郁夫代表日本人民发表演说称：“我克服了许多的困难，作为第一个参加国际民主会议的日本人来到这里，这个事实表明了日本人民对美帝国主义恢复日本军国主义进行坚决斗争的决心。”大山郁夫历述美国使日本重新军国主义化和殖民地化的情形及日本人民争取和平与独立的斗争后称：“我们日本人民相信有办法以和平方式解决日本问题，那就是：第一、迅速根据波茨坦公告、开罗宣言和雅尔达协议缔结全面对日和约，而且一定要有苏联和中华人民共和国参加；第二、在签订这样的和约以后的一定时期内自日本撤退一切占领军；第三、撤消禁止日本发展和平经济的禁令，取消它的战争潜力，撤消禁止日本与苏联、中国和朝鲜进行贸易的禁令；第四、斥责一切准备缔结侵略性太平洋公约的活动。”
    【新华社柏林二十三日电】在二十二日上午举行的世界和平理事会会议上，菲律宾代表柯鲁兹发表演说反对美帝国主义重新武装日本并表达了菲律宾人民保卫和平的坚决意志。柯鲁兹说：帝国主义——主要是美帝国主义只有在战争的掠夺中才能攫取巨额利润，所以它们总是害怕持久的和平。美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行胜过第二次世界大战期间日本军国主义者与德国法西斯的罪行，菲律宾人民对此极感愤怒。现在菲律宾的经济已从属于美国的战争计划，菲律宾已被用作美国进行侵略亚洲的战争基地。但是，尽管美国施用恫吓手段企图把菲律宾人民拖向毁灭人类的大战之中，菲律宾人民是爱好和平并且珍视自己的民族尊严的。他们已开始认识到他们之能否得救，完全取决于他们自己。柯鲁兹继称：美国恢复日本军国主义正是与它恢复德国法西斯主义的阴谋相配合的。重新武装日本就是使日本成为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的堡垒。广大的菲律宾人民正像他们的亚洲兄弟们一样，已对帝国主义的这种阴谋表示了正义的愤怒。除了以季里诺为首的一小撮卖国贼之外，全菲律宾人民坚决反对帝国主义的对日政策。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十二日讯：现在柏林出席世界和平理事会的英国全国和平委员会执行委员会的代表，经该委员会授权提出下列提案请世界和平理事会考虑采纳：第一，理事会应把一切与重新武装德国有关的问题提交全世界的人民；第二，理事会应就和平解决目前在德国问题上一切悬而未决的分歧点提出具体建议，不仅单纯地根据占领国家所提出的条件，而且应与德国各阶层人民作自由公开的协商和讨论；第三，应发起一个运动并成立一个组织，以促进德国和欧洲其他国家的人民，特别是德国和英国人民之间的互相访问与文化交流。英国和平委员会的代表声明称：“我们进一步认为：以和平方式解决德国问题，只有改变目前的重新武装德国的决定才有可能。我们号召一切爱好和平的人们加倍努力，迫使议员与社会领袖支持反对德国军国主义化，英国和平委员会已在几乎每一个地方组织了这个运动。”
