Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 19th: According to a report in the New York Worker's Daily on the 18th, the American Peace Crusade—an organization initiated by leaders in the American scientific and literary communities, Protestant bishops, and Black leaders—which will hold a grand peace petition in Washington on March 1st, will soon hold a peace vote. The ballot will pose only one question: "Do you favor withdrawing our troops from Korea and living in peace with China?" According to the initiators, the petition representatives will send these ballots to Truman and members of Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: TASS, New York, February 20th dispatch: Although the American authorities are employing fascist means of repression against peace fighters, the American peace movement is still growing stronger.

According to the Worker's Daily, the Gannett newspaper trust conducted a survey among readers in several towns in New York State and Illinois. The vast majority of readers in all locations favored the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. For example: Newburgh was 79 percent, Rochester was 80 percent, Binghamton was 86 percent, and Danville was 94 percent.

The Worker's Daily also stated that various progressive groups in the United States and the broad masses of the American people support the American Peace Crusade Committee, established by prominent progressives, which will organize a peace petition to Washington on March 1st. Many progressive groups—the Women's Peace Committee, the Black People's Committee to Defend Peace and Unity, the New York Veterans League, the New York Labor Peace Conference Committee, and many local branches of various unions—have announced their readiness to participate in this petition.

According to the Worker's Daily: Peace fighters held a rally in Seattle to defend peace. The meeting was attended by 250 representatives from religious groups and other organizations. The meeting passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, immediate negotiations between the major powers, the cessation of American interference in Taiwan, the withdrawal of American support for all "unpopular and anti-democratic regimes," and the admission of representatives of the Central People's Government of China to the United Nations. The people who attended the meeting also emphasized that the United Nations must be "an instrument of peace rather than an instrument of war."

    【新华社讯】布拉格十九日电：据纽约工人日报十八日报道，将于三月一日在华盛顿举行盛大和平请愿的美国和平十字军——由美国科学界和文学界领导人物、新教主教和黑人领袖发起的组织——不久将举办一次和平投票。票上只提出一个问题：“你赞成把我们的军队从朝鲜撤回并和中国和平相处吗？”据发起人说，请愿代表将把这种票送给杜鲁门和国会议员。
    【新华社二十二日讯】综合塔斯社纽约二十日消息：虽然美国当局对和平斗士横施法西斯式的镇压手段，但美国的和平运动仍在日益壮大。
    据工人日报报道，加奈特报业托辣斯曾在纽约州和伊利诺斯州若干城镇的读者中作了一次调查。各地读者中主张美军撤出朝鲜的占极大多数。例如：纽堡为百分之七十九、罗彻斯特为百分之八十、宾汉顿为百分之八十六、丹维尔为百分之九十四。
    工人日报又称，美国各进步团体和美国各界广大人民都支持著名进步人士所成立的美国和平十字军委员会，该委员会将于三月一日组织赴华盛顿的和平请愿。许多进步团体——妇女和平委员会、黑人保卫和平统一委员会、纽约退伍军人联盟、纽约劳工和平大会委员会及各工会的许多地方分会，都宣布它们准备参加这一请愿。
    又据工人日报报道：和平战士在西雅图举行了一次保卫和平的集会。参加集会的有代表宗教团体及其他团体的二百五十名代表。会议通过决议，要求自朝鲜撤退美军，立即在大国间进行谈判，停止美国对台湾的干涉，撤回美国对一切“不得人心的及反民主的政权”的支持，允许中国中央人民政府的代表参加联合国。参加集会的人们并强调联合国必须是“和平的工具而不是战争的工具”。
