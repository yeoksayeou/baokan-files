　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th: More than 1,200 townships in the Central and Southern China region have completed land reform, and more than 6,800 townships are in the process of land reform, totaling one-third of the areas (more than 24,000 townships) scheduled to complete land reform this spring.

　　In Jiangxi Province alone, in areas where land reform has been completed, farmers have received approximately 200 million catties of grain, over 140,000 houses, over 30,000 head of cattle, and over 500,000 pieces of farm implements, in addition to the land they were allocated. During the movement, the power of the rural people grew rapidly. Currently, the number of members of the Peasants' Association in Jiangxi Province has exceeded 2 million, and the militia has reached hundreds of thousands. During the movement, the militia confiscated more than 2,000 firearms from bandits and landlords who had hidden them. Many hidden bandits and secret agents were also exposed by the peasants during the land reform movement. For example, peasants in Chengguan District, Wufeng County, Hubei, exposed a secret agent hidden in the area who claimed to be the "County Magistrate of Songzi County."

　　People's courts in various parts of Central and Southern China supported the just demands of the broad masses of peasants and punished lawless landlords who stubbornly resisted land reform, playing a role in promoting the land reform movement. For example, after the People's Court of Huaiyang County, Henan, sentenced the landlord Lei Yuejing to imprisonment according to the law for destroying houses and property and ordered him to compensate the peasants for their losses, two other lawless landlords in the area automatically admitted their mistakes and compensated for the things they had destroyed. After the People's Court of Shangcheng County, Henan, executed the lawless landlord Zhang Houchuan, who murdered revolutionary cadres, other lawless landlords in the area immediately expressed remorse. However, in the struggle against lawless landlords in many areas, some did not fully utilize the people's courts, and some did not use them at all. The Central and Southern China Land Reform Committee has instructed all localities to pay attention to correcting this deviation.

### 中南千余乡完成土改  农村人民力量迅速增长

　　中南千余乡完成土改
　  农村人民力量迅速增长
    【新华社汉口十日电】中南区各省已有一千二百多个乡完成了土地改革，六千八百多个乡正在进行土地改革，合计占今春将完成土地改革地区（二万四千多个乡）的三分之一。
    仅江西省已完成土地改革的地区，农民除获得应分配的土地外，并获得了粮食约二亿斤，房屋十四万多间，耕牛三万多头和农具五十多万件。运动中，农村人民力量迅速增长，目前江西省农民协会会员已超过二百万，民兵已达数十万人。民兵在运动中共收缴了匪枪和地主暗藏的枪支二千多支。许多隐藏的土匪特务，在土地改革的运动中也被农民检举出来。如湖北五峰县城关区农民，就检举出一个隐藏在该地的号称“松滋县县长”的特务分子。
    中南各地的人民法庭，支持广大农民的正义要求，惩办顽抗土地改革的不法地主，对土地改革运动起了推动作用。如河南淮阳县人民法庭，把破坏房屋、财产的地主雷月敬依法判处徒刑，并责令他赔偿农民的损失后，当地另外两个不法地主，就自动承认了错误，赔偿了已破坏的东西。河南商城县人民法庭枪毙杀害革命干部的不法地主张厚传后，该地其他不法地主立即表示悔过。但许多地区在反对不法地主的斗争中，有的未充分运用人民法庭，有的根本未予运用。这个偏向，中南土地改革委员会已指示各地注意纠正。
