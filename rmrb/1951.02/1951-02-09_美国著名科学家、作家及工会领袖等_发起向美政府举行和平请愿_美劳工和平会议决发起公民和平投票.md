Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 8th: A New York dispatch: According to a report in the New York Worker on February 1st, sixty-five prominent American scientists, writers, Black leaders, labor movement activists, and Christian leaders have jointly launched the "American Peace Crusade." They have issued an appeal calling for a peace petition to be held in Washington on March 1st, so that members of the US Congress and the President may know "the peaceful will of all Americans—regardless of belief, color, profession, and political opinion." The appeal states: It is expected that more than three thousand representatives will participate in this petition.

The appeal calls for the withdrawal of American troops from Korea and an end to the war in the Far East, stating: "We firmly believe that the crisis in Asia can be resolved by abandoning the attempt to ignore the People's Republic of China and recognizing its right to be represented in the United Nations as the sole government of China today. But even before taking these steps, we must abandon the fruitless conflict in Korea and the actions that are destroying Korea and the Korean people."

Among the initiators of the American Peace Crusade and the peace petition are: Thomas Mann, winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature; Linus Pauling, former President of the American Chemical Society and head of the Chemistry Department at the California Institute of Technology; W.E.B. Du Bois, the famous Black sociologist and historian; Bishop Alleyne; Travis, Treasurer of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers; Dr. Brown, President of Palmer College; Dr. Morrison, Professor of Cornell University and nuclear physicist; Woolf, Justice of the Utah Supreme Court; Dagwell, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Oregon; Robertson; Demeo, Vice President of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America; Poertner, former professor of philosophy at Yenching University; Bryson, President of the National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: TASS, New York, February 4th: According to the Worker, the National Committee of the American Labor Peace Conference recently held an enlarged meeting in Chicago, attended by sixty-six delegates from eight states.

Mrs. Dowell, Liaison of the Chicago Committee of the American Labor Peace Conference, suggested establishing permanent peace groups in enterprises to link the struggle for peace with the struggle against actions damaging the economic rights of workers. The committee has decided to establish such groups.

Collins, a representative attending the Second World Peace Congress, reported on the work and resolutions of the Congress.

The National Committee also decided to hold citizen votes on the issue of defending peace throughout the country, organize meetings to hear reports from representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress, and immediately establish labor peace committees in another ten cities. The National Committee also decided to support the appeal of sixty-five prominent American figures to organize a "peace march" to Washington on March 1st.

The National Committee also sent a telegram to Truman, demanding that he resolve all international disputes through peaceful means and protesting the government's decision to freeze wages.
