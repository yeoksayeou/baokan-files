　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th: New York dispatch: After the US imperialist aggressor army suffered defeat in Korea, it is now engaged in a conspiracy to preserve the remnants of the Li Chengwan bandit gang and wait for an opportunity to rise again. It is reported that the US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Rusk, recently provided the State Department with a report on US policy in the Far East. Rusk argued that even if the United States cannot completely occupy Korea, it cannot abandon its continued support for the Li Chengwan puppet government. Rusk suggested to the US State Department that the United States should withdraw the Li Chengwan government and the remnants of the Li puppet army to the Japanese islands, and continue to provide them with the necessary funding and military assistance, for use in the United States launching another war of aggression against other regions of Asia in the future. According to people close to the US State Department, Rusk's proposal was discussed at a recent meeting attended by Truman, Marshall, Acheson, Bradley, and Snyder.

　　美帝又一阴谋计划
    企图把李承晚匪帮安置在日本      
    以备将来发动侵略战争时使用
    【新华社三十日讯】纽约讯：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的军队遭受失败后，现在又从事着一项保存李承晚残余匪军伺机再起的阴谋计划。据悉，美国远东助理国务卿鲁斯克最近曾经向国务院提供了一项有关美国在远东政策的报告书。鲁斯克主张：美国即或不能完全侵占朝鲜，也不能放弃对李承晚傀儡政府的继续支持。鲁斯克向美国国务院建议：美国应该撤退李承晚政府及李伪军残部到日本岛，并继续给以必要的经费及军火援助，以备美国将来对亚洲其他区域再度发动侵略战争时使用。据接近美国务院的人士透露：鲁斯克的这项建议，已在不久前有杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、布莱德雷和斯奈德出席的会议上讨论过。
