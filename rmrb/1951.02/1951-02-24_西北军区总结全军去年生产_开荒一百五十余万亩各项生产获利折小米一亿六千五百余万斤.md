　　Northwest Military Region Summarizes the Army's Production Last Year
　　Reclaimed Over 1.5 Million Mu of Land, Various Productions Yielding Profits Equivalent to 165.65 Million Jin of Millet
　　[This newspaper's report] The First Field Army of the Northwest Military Region convened a production meeting in mid-January. At the meeting, Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, made a preliminary summary of the army's production work in 1950 and pointed out the production policy for 1951. In 1950, the First Field Army, with a spirit of hard struggle, implemented Chairman Mao's decision on troops participating in production and achieved great results. According to preliminary statistics, all kinds of production in the army, excluding costs and consumption, produced a total value equivalent to 165,660,000 jin of millet. In terms of agricultural production, the army reclaimed a total of more than 1.5 million mu of land, and after deducting various disaster losses and cost consumption, the income was equivalent to more than 91,316,800 jin of millet. In terms of engineering construction, the army built a total of 1,566 large and small canals with a total length of 2,462,358 meters, irrigating a total area of 2,034,644 mu; constructed 7,688,515 cubic meters of earthwork for railway projects; and built 939 kilometers of major highway trunk lines. In addition, two reservoirs, 190 sluice gates, more than 11,000 houses, and other projects such as highway bridges were also built. In terms of sideline production, the army has a total of 1,752 cooperatives, factories, and workshops. 11,953 cattle, more than 220,000 sheep, more than 27,500 pigs, and more than 370,000 trees were planted.
　　The First Field Army's labor production over the past year has not only created wealth for the country and enhanced construction, but also has great significance for the troops themselves and the local people. First of all, the lives of the troops have been improved. The vegetables grown by the troops themselves cannot be eaten, and each person can eat an average of three or four jin of meat per month. The food in some units' large kitchens is close to the level of medium kitchens, and the production dividends of general commanders and fighters are generally more than 100,000 yuan, and some have reached 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Secondly, it has enhanced the troops' labor perspective. In particular, the education received by uprising troops, old personnel, and young intellectuals who have not been involved in the revolution for long is even greater. Again, it has promoted mass production and united the masses. The troops have reaped a bumper harvest because of their active production, which has stimulated and improved the production enthusiasm of the masses. In addition, the troops hunt wild animals in the mountains and open canals in the plains, so that the masses can concentrate on production and obtain irrigation convenience. For example, in Hexi, Gansu, the local people's harvests have been guaranteed because the troops opened canals, and the people said with emotion: "Whenever we pick up the rice bowl, we think of the People's Liberation Army." At the same time, because the troops carry out production themselves, the burden on the people is relatively reduced. For example, the troops stationed in Xinjiang have mostly been able to produce for self-sufficiency.
　　This year's production policy is to improve the lives of the troops, under the premise of strengthening national defense construction.
　　At the meeting, all units discussed the summary report and this year's production policy, and formulated a production plan for 1951.

　　西北军区总结全军去年生产
　　开荒一百五十余万亩各项生产获利折小米一亿六千五百余万斤
    【本报讯】西北军区第一野战军于一月中旬召开生产会议。会上军区副司令员张宗逊对一九五零年全军的生产工作作了初步总结，并指出了一九五一年的生产方针。一九五零年第一野战军以艰苦奋斗的精神，执行了毛主席关于部队参加生产的决定，获得了很大成绩。据初步统计，全军各种生产，除成本及消耗以外，共生产价值折合小米一亿六千五百六十六万斤。在农业生产方面，全军共开荒地一百五十余万亩，除去各种灾害损失及成本消耗，收益共折合小米九千一百三十一万六千八百余斤。在工程建筑方面，全军共修筑大小水渠一千五百六十六条，全长二百四十六万二千三百五十八公尺，可灌溉地总面积有二百零三万四千六百四十四亩；建筑铁道工程土石方共七百六十八万八千五百十五公方；修筑公路主要干线九百三十九公里。此外，并修筑了水库两个，水闸一百九十个，房屋一万一千余间及公路桥梁等其他工程。在副业生产方面，计全军有合作社、工厂、作坊共一千七百五十二个。养牛一万一千九百五十三头，羊二十二万余只，猪二万七千五百余头并植树三十七万余株。
    第一野战军一年来的劳动生产，不仅替国家创造了财富，增强了建设，对部队本身和当地人民更有着巨大的意义。首先，部队的生活得到了改善。部队自己种的青菜吃不完，平均每人每月可以吃到三、四斤肉，有些单位大灶生活接近了中灶水平，一般指战员的生产分红均在十万元以上，有一部分并达到三、四十万元。其次，增强了部队的劳动观点。特别是起义部队、旧人员及参加革命不久的知识青年所受的教育更大。再次，推动了群众的生产并团结了群众。部队因为积极生产而得到了丰收，这就激发并提高了群众的生产情绪。此外，部队在山区打野兽，平地开水渠，使群众能够安心生产，并得到了灌溉的便利。如甘肃河西因部队开了水渠，使当地群众的收成有了保证，老百姓都感动地说：“端起饭碗就想起了人民解放军。”同时，因为部队自己动手进行生产，相对地便减轻了人民的负担。如新疆的驻军，大部分已能够生产自给。
    今年的生产方针，是在加强国防建设的前提下，以改善部队生活为主。
    会上，各单位对总结报告与今年生产方针进行了讨论，并订出了一九五一年的生产计划。
