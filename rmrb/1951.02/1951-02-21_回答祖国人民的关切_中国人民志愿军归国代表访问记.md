　　Answering the Concerns of the Motherland's People
    —A Visit with Returning Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    The Chinese people are constantly concerned about the People's Volunteer Army fighting abroad, and about the enormous contributions they have made in supporting the Korean front. At a rally where a returning representative of the Volunteer Army was invited to give a speech to thousands of middle and primary school students in Beijing, a young girl wrote on a piece of paper with enthusiasm and naiveté, "Have you received the gloves and comfort bags we sewed?" The Volunteer Army representative immediately replied to the entire audience, "Thank you all, we have received them. The Volunteer Army soldiers are wearing your gloves and are even more bravely annihilating the enemy!" His words were immediately drowned out by thunderous applause and cheers. The little girl's words express the feelings of hundreds of millions of Chinese people with deep affection.
    The returning representatives of the Volunteer Army told reporters that the enormous support of the people of the whole country is an extremely important factor in enabling the Volunteer Army warriors to defeat the enemy and advance bravely. From the Chongchon River to the Han River front, the Volunteer Army has received four large amounts of comfort materials. Each time, it aroused the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters to love their motherland even more and further strengthened their determination to defend the security of the motherland.
    After the Battle of Unsan, the Volunteer Army heard on the radio that the Northeast People's Volunteer Organization had volunteered to support the front with more than 30,000 stretchers. This inspiring news spread like wildfire throughout every trench on the front, causing the entire unit to boil over. The soldiers enthusiastically cheered: 475 million people are supporting us! Every company wrote letters to their superiors, requesting the most arduous tasks.
    About seven or eight days later, in the middle of the night, the troops marched south through heavy wind and snow. On the road near Pyongyang, they discovered a column of people who also looked like snowmen, interspersed with many "sleds" (transport tools in Northeast China and Korea) dragging heavy materials. A member of the Volunteer Army greeted them by asking for directions: "Yo bao!" (Korean for "Hey!"). Unexpectedly, the other party replied in Chinese, "We are not 'Yo bao'." It turned out that they were the volunteer stretcher teams from various parts of Northeast China, who had brought a portion of comfort materials to the Volunteer Army. The two teams were immediately a sensation, and cheers erupted in the ranks, and even the most silent people usually sang happily. This was the first time the Volunteer Army had seen people from the motherland after going abroad. This kind of intimate feeling will never be forgotten by everyone who experienced it at the time.
    The Volunteer Army received valuable gifts from the people of the motherland—fried noodles and pork. The fried noodles are made of wheat mixed with a small amount of sesame, soybeans, and peanuts, which are finely ground into flour after being skillfully fried. Some are sweet, some are salty, and they are delicious. The soldiers affectionately called them "sent by the motherland." When chasing the enemy at high speed, this is the best field ration. One Volunteer Army soldier ate it while saying to his partner: "This fried noodles may have been made and sent to us by my mother."
    In another march, a unit of the Volunteer Army received a large number of comfort items, which greatly encouraged the fighting will of the troops. A Volunteer Army platoon leader gratefully said to his superior, "The people of the motherland are supporting us like this. I am determined to strive to return home wearing a hero's medal!" This feeling is extremely common in the Volunteer Army.
    On November 30, the Volunteer Army listened to the broadcast of Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of our country, making a speech at the United Nations Security Council to condemn the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan. The leaders of a Volunteer Army unit personally held a meeting to convey this historic speech. The returning representative of the Volunteer Army told reporters: "Everyone felt that we were supporting Representative Wu; at the same time, we felt that the people of the whole world were supporting us behind us." The Volunteer Army soldiers, who love their motherland, were so excited that some even shed tears when they heard the representatives of the great Chinese people speaking to the world in a righteous and confident manner for the first time. "The era in which imperialism is allowed to invade but the people are not allowed to resist is over. The Chinese people are fully confident of repelling all imperialists who dare to invade China." This sentence has become a strong force to encourage the Volunteer Army soldiers to move forward more bravely.
    After the New Year's offensive, the following heroic story circulated in the troops: A soldier in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army pointed to a mountain on the south bank of the Imjin River to his comrades when the battle started and said, "The people of the whole world are watching us. Today, we will achieve merit on this mountain; if we sacrifice gloriously, it must also be on this mountain." He rushed forward bravely at the front of the assault team and was seriously injured on the beachhead position. He fainted. The troops rushed past him. After he woke up, he looked up at the mountain, picked up his gun, stood up, and continued to rush forward. Others only thought he had a minor injury. He fainted again halfway up the mountain, woke up, looked again at the mountain that was in fierce battle, and climbed up the mountain again. He fainted once more in the middle. Finally, he and his comrades successfully captured the commanding heights of this high ground. At this time, he asked half-consciously, "Where is this?" The soldiers beside him told him, "This is the mountain." He smiled and said, "Oh, I've reached the mountain!" After saying that, he fell to the ground and sacrificed gloriously.
    Throughout the front, radios and the Beijing People's Daily and Northeast Daily became the best bridges for the soldiers to connect spiritually with the motherland. Volunteer Army leaders listed listening to the motherland's broadcasts as one of the important work items. After each listening, they immediately copied it and distributed it to various companies, so that the soldiers could hold meetings from time to time to discuss the current situation. The newspapers of the motherland were transported by special vehicles. Every time they arrived, they were snapped up. Everyone read them carefully word by word and sentence by sentence. They missed everything about the motherland. They felt extremely excited about the vigorous anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement of the people of the motherland and the progress of every construction project in the motherland. On the distant front lines, they used one victory after another as gifts to celebrate the New Year and Spring Festival with the people of the motherland.
    Every commander and fighter of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and protecting the motherland, deeply appreciates the great love of the people of the motherland for them. The people of the motherland are also constantly concerned about their volunteer anti-U.S. aggression and aid-Korea and defending the motherland children. This deep and noble feeling is an invincible force, which, together with the great power of the Korean people, will eventually defeat the American aggressors.

　　回答祖国人民的关切
    —中国人民志愿军归国代表访问记
    中国人民无时无刻不在关心着在国外作战的人民志愿军，关心着自己支援朝鲜前线所作的巨大贡献。在一位志愿军归国代表应邀向北京市数千中、小学生作讲演的大会上，一位幼小的女学生在一张纸条上写着热情、天真的问话：“我们缝的手套、慰问袋你们收到了吗？”志愿军代表马上向全场答道：“谢谢大家，收到了，志愿军战士们正戴着你们的手套，更勇敢地歼灭着敌人！”他的话立即给春雷似的掌声与欢呼淹没了。那位小女学生的话，深情贯注地表达了全中国亿万人民的心情。
    志愿军归国代表告诉记者：全国人民巨大的支援，是使志愿军勇士们击败敌人、奋勇前进的极其重要的因素。从清川江到汉江前线，志愿军前后已经收到四次大量的慰劳物资。每一次都使志愿军指战员更加激发起对自己祖国的热爱，更加坚定了捍卫祖国安全的决心。
    云山战役后，志愿军从收音机里听到东北人民志愿组织三万余副担架志愿支援前方的消息。这个振奋人心的消息风快地传遍了前线上的每一个战壕里，使整个部队沸腾了。战士们热情地欢呼：四亿七千五百万人民都在支援着我们！每个连队都写信给上级，要求最艰巨的任务。
    约在七、八天后的一个下半夜，部队冒着大风雪向南进军。在走近平壤附近的路上，他们发现一列也像一个个雪人儿似的队伍，中间还夹杂着许多拖着沉重的物资的“爬犁”（东北、朝鲜一带的运输工具）。志愿军中先有人打招呼问路：“吆包！”（朝鲜语“喂！”的意思）想不到对方却用中国话回答说：“我们不是‘吆包’。”原来他们就是来自东北各地的志愿担架队，已经给志愿军带来了一部分慰劳物资。这两支队伍顿时轰动了，行列中爆发了欢呼，连平时最沉默的人也高兴地歌唱起来。这是志愿军出国后第一次看到从祖国来的人，这种亲切的情感，是当时每一个亲历其境的人所永远遗忘不了的。
    志愿军收到了祖国人民的珍贵的礼物——炒面和猪肉。炒面是用麦子搀着少量芝麻、黄豆、花生妙熟后磨为粉面精工制成的，有甜的，有咸的，美味可口。战士们爱昵地说是“祖国送来的”。在高速度地追击敌人时，这是最好的战地给养。有一位志愿军战士一边吃一边和他的伙伴说：“这妙面也许是我母亲给我们做了送来的。”
    在另一次行军中，志愿军某部，领到了大批慰劳品，这些可贵的礼物使部队的战斗意志得到极大的鼓舞。有一位志愿军的排长感激地对上级说：“祖国人民这样支援我们，我下决心争取戴着英雄奖章回国去！”这种心情在志愿军中是极其普遍的。
    十一月三十日，志愿军收听到我国特派代表伍修权在联合国安全理事会上发言控诉美国武装侵略台湾的广播。志愿军某部首长亲自集会传达了这个历史性的发言。志愿军归国代表告诉记者：“我们每个人都觉得自己在给伍代表撑腰；同时又觉得全世界人民在后面给我们撑腰。”热爱祖国的志愿军战士们听到伟大的中国人民的代表第一次对全世界理直气壮地说了话，有人竟兴奋得流下泪来。“只准帝国主义侵略，不准人民反抗的时代已经过去了。中国人民完全有信心打退敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义者。”这句话成为鼓舞志愿军战士们更加英勇地前进的坚强力量。
    在新年攻势结束后，部队中传诵着这样一个英雄的故事：志愿军某部一个战士，他在战斗发起时指着临津江南岸的一座山头对他的战友说：“全世界人民在看着咱们。今天，立功，在这个山头上；光荣牺牲，也一定在这个山头上。”他勇猛地冲在突击队的前面，在滩头阵地上负了重伤，他晕倒了。部队在他身旁冲了过去。他苏醒过来后，抬头望了望山头，拿着枪站起来，继续向前冲去。别人只当他挂了轻花。他在山腰中又晕倒了，醒来后又望了望正在激战着的山头，又爬起来向山上冲去。中间他又晕倒了一次。最后，他终于与他的战友们一起攻下了这个高地的制高点。这时，他半昏迷地问：“这是那里？”身旁的战士告诉他：“这就是山头。”他露出了笑容说：“噢，我到了山头了！”说完，就倒在地上光荣牺牲了。
    在整个前线，收音机和北京人民日报、东北日报成了战士们在精神上与祖国联结在一起的最好的桥梁。志愿军领导干部把收听祖国广播列为重要工作项目之一，每次收听后立即缮写出来，分发到各个连队去，使战士们能不时开会讨论时局。祖国的报纸是用专车负责运输的。每次一到，抢借一空。每个人都逐句逐字地细读。他们怀念着祖国的每一件事。他们对祖国人民的蓬勃的抗美援朝爱国运动，对祖国的每一项建设的进展，感到莫大兴奋。他们在遥远的前线，用一个接一个的胜利，作为祝贺祖国人民欢度新年和春节的礼物。
    为抗美援朝、保家卫国而战斗着的中国人民志愿军的每一个指挥员和战斗员们，深深感谢祖国人民对他们的伟大的热爱。祖国人民也无时无刻不在关心着自己的志愿抗美援朝保家卫国的子弟兵。这种深厚高尚的感情，是一股无敌的力量，与朝鲜人民的伟大的力量加在一起，必将最后击败美国侵略者。
