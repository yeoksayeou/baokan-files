	The atrocities of the Thai reactionary government against overseas Chinese
	Our compatriots residing in Thailand have suffered persecution and humiliation from the Thai reactionary government over the years. They have been deprived of the freedom of business, residence, education, and speech, and have been subjected to large-scale massacres and arrests by the Thai reactionary government on several occasions. Recently, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government has further used fascist means to deal with overseas Chinese in Thailand. On January 31 this year, the Thai reactionary government, on the pretext that "Quanmin Bao" (全民报) published articles about local overseas Chinese boycotting American goods and not watching American movies, unreasonably arrested Cai Zhihong, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, and Wu Jianzhong, the publisher. The Thai Ministry of Interior also threatened to deport Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong. "Quanmin Bao" has lodged a strong protest with the Thai reactionary government about this matter. Local overseas Chinese are all indignant about this incident, and have gone to the newspaper to express their condolences and protest to the Thai reactionary government.
	The fascist dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram, took advantage of his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Army to launch a coup on June 24, 1932, and seized power. Since then, he has colluded with imperialists to brutally suppress the Thai people and persecute overseas Chinese in Thailand. During World War II, Luang Phibunsongkhram became a running dog of Japanese imperialism, relying on the power of the Japanese bandits to attack domestic democratic forces and overseas Chinese in Thailand.
	However, after World War II, American power increasingly infiltrated Thailand. In order to find a proxy in Thailand, the American imperialists brazenly not only did not try and punish Luang Phibunsongkhram, the chief war criminal of Thailand and an accomplice of Japanese fascism, but released him from prison in March 1946, and helped him launch a "coup" in November 1947 to establish the Luang Phibunsongkhram fascist regime that relied on the United States.
	The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government has consistently pursued an anti-Chinese policy. During the Pacific War, under the protection of Japanese imperialism, the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government advocated "Greater Thai Nationalism" and actively rejected and persecuted overseas Chinese in Thailand.
	After Luang Phibunsongkhram regained power with the support of the United States in 1947, his anti-Chinese atrocities intensified. Luang Phibunsongkhram's anti-Chinese atrocities were instigated by the United States and carried out in cooperation with Kuomintang bandit secret agents. The five million overseas Chinese in Thailand have suffered greatly under the crazy persecution of imperialists and their running dogs.
	The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government barbarously violated the personal freedom of overseas Chinese. Thai detectives and secret agents entered the residences and shops of overseas Chinese at any time, and arbitrarily arrested and tortured them on trumped-up charges such as "dangerous elements" and "pro-communist." On June 15, 1948, the Thai reactionary government, with the help of Kuomintang bandits, arrested 341 overseas Chinese in one fell swoop. From June 1949, the Thai police authorities also used so-called "foreigner identity cards" and "household registration surveys" to control the movement of overseas Chinese, and established concentration camps to detain overseas Chinese. In October 1949, when the Central People's Government of China was established, overseas Chinese in Thailand prepared to celebrate in order to express their love for the new China. However, the Thai police authorities, under the instruction of the United States, stopped them and unreasonably arrested more than a thousand overseas Chinese and imprisoned them in Bangkok Grand Prison. The imprisoned overseas Chinese were subjected to torture and beatings, and more than ten people were beaten to death or poisoned. At the beginning of last year, Fang Jingnan and four other representatives of more than a thousand suffering overseas Chinese wrote to Chairman Mao, calling for rescue. Last October, nine overseas Chinese living in Yala Province in southern Thailand were arrested for the so-called "propaganda of communism." These tyrannical acts of the Thai reactionary government fully demonstrate its hostility towards the Chinese people.
	The Thai reactionary government, according to the "Regulations on Expulsion of Overseas Chinese," arbitrarily expelled overseas Chinese on the grounds of "suspicious behavior" and "unnecessary residents." Last September, 51 overseas Chinese were unreasonably deported back to China because of "purchasing Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds" and "unnecessary residence." Along with the 51 overseas Chinese who were deported back to China, there were also more than 700 overseas Chinese workers, farmers, teachers, students, and small businessmen living in Thailand, most of whom were forced to return to China because they could not bear the oppression and plunder of the Thai reactionary government and could not make a living. In December 1950, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government sent a running dog member of parliament, Nai Thongpun, to the Thai Lower House to propose a "restricted area regulation" covering 18 provinces. The regulation stipulated that all foreigners in the restricted area, together with all their movable and immovable property, must move out within 60 days after the demarcation of the restricted area. Thonburi Province, the most densely populated area of overseas Chinese, was also included. If the regulation were implemented, many overseas Chinese would be ruined and have nowhere to live.
	In the economic field, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government formulated a series of so-called "occupational security regulations" to undermine the industry and commerce operated by overseas Chinese. In August 1948, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government ordered the prohibition of foreigners from operating 11 kinds of factories, such as winemaking, sugar making, tofu, rice noodles, matches, leather, silk making, glass, and glue boiling; and 90 percent of the above-mentioned industries were operated by overseas Chinese. In February 1949, it was announced that ten occupations, such as hairdressing, making Buddha statues, tricycles, and fashion, were not allowed to be operated by overseas Chinese, causing more than 100,000 overseas Chinese to lose their jobs. In May of the same year, it was announced that eight kinds of small businesses, such as rubber and soda, were not allowed to be operated by overseas Chinese. At the same time, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government ordered the eight kinds of factories in Bangkok to move out of the urban area within a time limit. The vegetable gardens, fish ponds, chicken farms, and pig farms operated by overseas Chinese in the suburbs of Bangkok were also ordered to be relocated or demolished by the Thai authorities. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese were thus plunged into bankruptcy and could not make a living.
	The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government barbarously deprived overseas Chinese of their freedom of culture and education, and wantonly destroyed overseas Chinese schools. The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government sealed up overseas Chinese schools on the grounds of "accepting illegal teachers," "lack of Thai language teaching hours," and "spreading political doctrines that endanger Thailand." By the end of 1950, only 310 of the original 1,000-plus Thai overseas Chinese schools remained. According to the regulations of the Thai reactionary government's Ministry of Education, the surviving overseas Chinese schools were restricted to teaching Chinese for only one and a half to two hours a day. At the same time, each school must have a Thai principal, and each grade must have a Thai homeroom teacher. History, geography, arithmetic, singing, sports, and other courses must also be taught by Thais. Due to the reactionary measures of the Thai reactionary government, more than 3,000 overseas Chinese teachers lost their jobs, and more than 200,000 children were out of school.
	At the same time, the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government has stepped up its destruction of progressive overseas Chinese newspapers. At the beginning of 1949, the Thai reactionary government searched "Quanmin Bao" twice without reason, and arrested four employees. In April of the same year, it also implemented press censorship on "Zhenhua Bao," "Quanmin Bao," and "Minzhu Xinwen," and forced "Zhenhua Bao" to cease publication. Recently, it blatantly arrested two persons in charge of "Quanmin Bao."
	The five million overseas Chinese in Thailand have suffered political and economic persecution from the Thai reactionary government. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government not only ignored the interests of overseas Chinese, but also colluded with the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government to persecute overseas Chinese. Today, the Chinese people have victoriously stood up. The Chinese people will never allow the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese to be violated or persecuted in any way. The Chinese people have enough strength to strike at those who provoke them.

### 泰国反动政府迫害华侨的暴行

　　泰国反动政府迫害华侨的暴行
    我国旅泰侨胞，历年来曾遭受了泰国反动政府的迫害与凌辱。他们被剥夺了营业、居住、教育言论的自由，并曾数度遭受过泰国反动政府的大规模屠杀与拘捕等事件。而近来，銮披汶政府更进一步地使用法西斯手段对付旅泰华侨。今年一月三十一日，泰国反动政府借口《全民报》登载了当地华侨抵制美国货和不看美国电影的文章，将该报总编辑蔡志宏及该报出版人吴建中无理逮捕。泰国内政部并扬言要将蔡志宏及吴建中驱逐出境。全民报已就此事向泰国反动政府提出强烈抗议。当地侨胞对此事件无不激愤，纷纷前往该报慰问，并向泰国反动政府提出抗议。
    法西斯独裁者，銮披汶自从一九三二年“六、二四”利用他任陆军总司令职务之便，发动政变，窃取政权后，即和帝国主义者们勾结，血腥地镇压泰国人民，并大肆迫害旅泰华侨。在二次世界大战期间，銮披汶则做了日本帝国主义者的走狗，凭借日本强盗的声势，向国内民主势力和旅泰华侨开刀。
    但是，二次大战后，美国势力日益侵入泰国，美帝国主义者为了在泰国找出一个代理人，竟悍然地，不但不对銮披汶这个日本法西斯的帮凶泰国头号战犯进行审讯惩处，而竟于一九四六年三月把他从监狱中释放出来，并帮助他于一九四七年十一月发动“政变”，建立起投靠美帝的銮披汶法西斯政权。
    銮披汶反动政府一贯地执行着排华政策。在太平洋战争期间，銮披汶反动政府在日本帝国主义的卵翼下，倡导“大泰族主义”，更积极排斥和迫害旅泰华侨。
    一九四七年銮披汶在美帝的扶持下重新篡夺政权之后，排华暴行，日益加剧。銮披汶的排华暴行，是得到美帝的指使，同时并得到国民党匪帮特务分子的合作。旅泰五百万华侨在帝国主义者及其走狗们的疯狂迫害下受尽了苦难。
    銮披汶反动政府野蛮地侵犯了华侨身体的自由。泰国的警探特务，随时进入华侨的住宅和商店，以“危险分子”和“亲共”等莫须有的罪名，任意予以逮捕和拷打。一九四八年六月十五日，泰国反动政府在国民党匪特的帮助下，曾一次逮捕了华侨三百四十一名。一九四九年六月起，泰国警察当局又以所谓“外侨随身证”及“调查户口登记”措施，管制华侨行动，并设立集中村，拘禁华侨。一九四九年十月我中央人民政府成立，泰国华侨为了表示对新中国的热爱，纷纷准备庆祝。但泰国警察当局遵照美帝的指使，竟予以制止，并将千余名华侨无理逮捕，囚入曼谷大监狱中。被囚禁的华侨受尽酷刑毒打，并有十余人被打死或被毒毙。去年初，千余受难华侨代表方泾南等五人曾上书毛主席呼吁营救。去年十月居于泰国南部耶拉省的九名华侨，因为所谓“宣传共产主义”的罪名而被捕。泰国反动政府这些横暴行为，充分说明它对中国人民的敌视。
    泰国反动政府根据“驱逐华侨出境条例”随时借口“形迹可疑”、“不必要居民”等莫须有的罪名将华侨驱逐出境。去年九月间即有五十一名侨胞被无理遣送回国，原因是因为“购买胜利折实公债”和“不需要居住”。与五十一名被驱逐回国侨胞同时归国者，尚有旅居泰国的华侨工人、农民、教师、学生、小商人等七百余人，他们大部分是因不堪受泰国反动政府的压迫、掠夺、无法生活而被迫返国的。一九五○年十二月銮披汶政府派走狗议员乃通奔向泰下院提出范围达十八府的“禁区条例”，该条例规定所有禁区外侨连同其一切动产与不动产在禁区划定后六十天内一律迁出。华侨最密集地区吞武里府也在内，如果该条例付诸实施，则很多华侨势将倾家荡产，无处安身。
    在经济方面，銮披汶政府制订了一系列的所谓“职业保障条例”，摧残华侨经营的工商业。一九四八年八月，銮披汶政府下令禁止外侨经营制酒、制糖、豆腐、米粉、火柴、皮革、制丝、玻璃及熬胶等十一种工厂；而上述工业中有百分之九十是华侨经营的。一九四九年二月，又宣布理发、制造佛像、三轮车、时装等十种职业，不许华侨经营，而使十万余华侨失业。同年五月，又宣布树胶、汽水等八种小商业不准华侨经营。同时，銮披汶政府又下令曼谷八种场坊，限期迁出市区。华侨在曼谷市郊经营的菜园、鱼池、养鸡场、养猪场等，亦被泰国当局下令迁移或拆毁。数十万华侨因而陷于破产，无法生活的困境。
    銮披汶反动政府野蛮地剥夺华侨的文化教育自由，对华侨学校横加摧残。銮披汶反动政府借“收容非法教师执教”、“教授泰文钟点见缺”及“传播危害泰国的政治主义”等“罪名”大肆查封华侨学校。截至一九五○年底，原有的一千多所泰国华侨学校，仅剩了三百一十所。而幸存的侨校，根据泰国反动政府教育部的规定，限制侨校每天只能教一小时半至两小时的中文。同时，各校必须设泰籍校长，每级必须设泰籍级任。史地、算术、唱歌、体育等课程也必须由泰人任教。由于泰国反动政府的反动措施，致令三千余华侨教师失业，二十余万儿童失学。
    同时，銮披汶反动政府对进步华侨报纸，备加摧残。一九四九年初，泰反动政府，无故搜查《全民报》两次，并捕去职员四人，同年四月间，又对《真话报》、《全民报》与《民主新闻》实施新闻检查，并强迫《真话报》停刊，最近又悍然逮捕了全民报两负责人。
    旅泰的五百万华侨受尽了泰国反动政府的政治与经济迫害。过去国民党反动政府不单是漠视侨胞的利益，同时，又勾结銮披汶反动政府共同迫害华侨。而今天，中国人民已经胜利地站起来了。中国人民决不允许海外华侨的正当权益遭到任何的侵犯和迫害。中国人民有足够的力量给挑拨者以打击。
