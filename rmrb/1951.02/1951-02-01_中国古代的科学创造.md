　　Ancient Chinese Scientific Creations
　　Professor Qian Weichang, Tsinghua University
    Our great motherland possesses an outstanding and rich historical legacy. For thousands of years, our ancestors have toiled continuously on this vast East Asian continent, creating and battling nature. Through diligent and enduring labor, and brilliant scientific inventions, they left us, the 475 million descendants, this fertile and beautiful land and incomparably glorious history. Every Chinese person is proud of our country and proud of our country's history. We love our great motherland, and we love our motherland's glorious history even more. We will certainly inherit the excellent traditions of our ancestors and, through continuous labor and creation, make our beautiful motherland even more beautiful and our glorious history even more glorious.
    Now, let us respectfully recount the brilliant creations of our ancestors in their struggle with nature on this land.
    For thousands of years, our ancestors have primarily engaged in agricultural labor. The vast fertile land in our country today, which provides us with food and clothing, is not accidental, but the result of the continuous struggle between the Chinese people and nature over thousands of years. This long struggle includes the glorious history of collecting wild beasts and birds, raising them into domestic animals; collecting wild plants and cultivating them into grains; and continuously battling floods. In this history of fighting against nature, there have been many great and outstanding scientists, engineers, and inventors, who have gloriously created and accumulated many scientific experiences for the people to enrich their lives.
    Very early on, the Chinese people began to grow rice and gradually improved the scientific methods of cultivating rice. To this day, our farmers have excellent methods of selecting seeds and very scientific farming experience. Chinese silk is one of the greatest inventions of the Chinese people in utilizing and transforming nature. The Chinese people also cultivated wild legumes from very early on, making them our people's most nutritious food. The variety of vegetables in our country is also the greatest in the world. To this day, the main foods in European and American countries are only meat, fish, wheat, and a few vegetables. However, our food variety is abundant, adding infinite content to our lives. In these agricultural inventions, many great names are passed down in folklore, such as mythical inventors like Shennong, Fuxi, and Leizu. The appearance of these inventors dates back to four or five thousand years ago. Although many of them only left symbolic names, perhaps representing a clan, and there is insufficient accurate historical data for verification, the people constantly remember these brilliant inventions and creations closely related to their lives, and their respect and love for them is not diminished by the historical obscurity.
    To ensure the harvest of agricultural production, water conservancy projects are the central issue of our ancestors' scientific labor. Our ancestors had to fight floods, mainly the Yellow River, and build large-scale irrigation projects. To conduct shipping in vast areas, our ancestors also built large-scale canal and water transport networks. In these great projects and constructions, countless outstanding engineers emerged, accumulating incomparably rich scientific experience.
    The most admired water conservancy engineer in legend is Yu. At that time, the Yellow River in North China did not have the waterways it has today. The water source flowing eastward from Kunlun converged into the largest volume, forming a flood situation where "the flood was滔滔, and the world was submerged." High ground and mountains were divided by water into pieces of continents and islands. Under the control of this natural force, it was not easy for our ancestors to carry out flood control work with the lower productivity at that time. Legend has it that Yu learned from the failure of his predecessor Gun in controlling water, followed the nature of the water, guided it according to the situation, and led the people to work for nine consecutive years (approximately from 2286 to 2278 BC), gradually restraining the water flow and determining the river channel of the Yellow River flowing into the sea for the first time in Chinese history. Yu's flood control work covered the whole country. His selfless enthusiasm for work, passing his home three times in nine years without entering, demonstrated the excellent national tradition of serving the people.
    Yu's flood control work initially overcame the serious flood disaster, laying the foundation for our nation to live and reproduce on this land. However, the Yellow River carried a large amount of sand from the upper reaches and flowed down rapidly. When it reached the lower reaches, people diverted the river water to irrigate fields, slowing down the river flow, so that the exit to the sea gradually silted up. As a result, floods would occur from time to time when the water rose. This situation continued until the time of Wang Mang (9-22 AD), when Zhang Rong, a resident of Chang'an, scientifically pointed out the relationship between water flow velocity and sand siltation. This scientific conclusion became the basic principle for later famous water conservancy engineers such as Wang Jing (Emperor Ming of Han, 69 AD), Jia Lu (Emperor Taiding of Jin, 1351 AD), Pan Jixun (Jiajing of Ming, 1565 AD), and Jin Fu (Kangxi of Qing, 1677 AD) in governing the Yellow River. Based on this principle, they created the method of "building dikes to restrain water and using water to attack sand" for water management. While resolutely implementing this principle, these engineers overcame many engineering difficulties, mobilized tens of thousands of people, and completed many great projects of building canals and dikes. These great engineers were closely integrated with the people who participated in the construction. Pan Jixun worked with the masses when the project was urgent, encouraging everyone and strengthening their working spirit, so that the river project turned danger into safety. During their work, they also had to publicize the principles of river management to the masses from time to time, and they also scientifically summarized the experience of the work. For example, Ouyang Xuan, Jia Lu's companion, wrote a book called "Zhi Zheng River Defense Records" (1360 AD), which described the content of various water conservancy projects such as dike management and beach management in great detail and systematically, making it the first systematic water conservancy engineering work of mankind.
    Since our country has such a vast territory, inland water transport is a very important matter. Our ancestors, with hard work, have dug countless canals and waterways across the country for four thousand years. For example, Wu Yuan of the State of Wu in the Spring and Autumn Period (495 BC) took Taihu Lake as the center and led the people to dig the canal network in the Yangtze River Delta. Even today, after continuous dredging and repairs, it is still enjoyed by the people. For example, Shi Lu of Qin Shihuang (215 BC) dug the Ling Canal in the east of Xing'an County, Hunan, connecting the water and land transportation of Hunan and Guangxi. Near Xing'an County, the terrain is high, and the Xiang River and the Li River originate here. The Xiang River flows north, and the Li River flows south, but they are not connected. Shi Lu scientifically used water power to dig the Ling Canal, which is sixty miles long and has thirty-six gates, using the method of accumulating graded water gates, connecting north-south navigation. We feel unparalleled pride in having such a genius invention in such an early era. This canal was dredged and widened during the time of Ma Yuan, the end of the Ming Dynasty, and has made outstanding contributions to north-south transportation.
    Since our country has developed agriculture, the achievements of irrigation projects are of course too numerous to write about. We will now present a more famous irrigation water conservancy project to illustrate the greatness of our ancestors. During the reign of King Hui of Qin, Li Bing, the governor of Shu, and his son Erlang, dug Lidui southwest of Guan County, Sichuan, diverting water into inner and outer rivers, and built the nationally famous Dujiangyan at the water diversion point to regulate water flow. This project irrigated the fields in more than a dozen counties near Chengdu, turning Chengdu into the "Land of Abundance." After this project was completed with difficulty, the principles of regulating water flow were scientifically summarized, and the six characters "Dig the beach deep, build the weir low" were carved on the stone. This scientific conclusion is highly valued by later generations. The local people, in order to love this great engineer, built a shrine in Dujiangyan to commemorate him, which is the famous Erlang Temple. Every year on April 1st, when the weir is opened, a grand ceremony is held.
    Our water conservancy projects serve agriculture, and our mathematical development also serves agriculture. The outstanding Chinese people invented and adopted the decimal system and the "Nine-Nine" multiplication table very early (legend says it was invented by Fuxi). This song has been used to this day without a single word being changed. Between the Spring and Autumn and Qin and Han Dynasties, in order to calculate the size of fields, the amount of taxes, and the transportation and management of grain, the famous "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art" (approximately 450 AD) and "Zhoubi Suanjing" (approximately 100 BC) were created. In these two books, the genius creations of outstanding Chinese mathematicians of this era, such as Zhang Cang (200 BC), Geng Shouchang (50 BC), Xu Shang, and Du Zhong (20-30 BC), are summarized. They have already used simple fractions, multivariate first-order equations, binary quadratic equations, arithmetic progressions and other algebraic problems, and geometric problems such as the value of pi being equal to three, and the Pythagorean theorem of a right triangle being "gou three, gu four, xian five." Later, the genius mathematician Zhao Junqing used geometry to prove the famous theorem that the square of the gou plus the square of the gu equals the square of the xian. The earliest proof of this theorem in other countries was by the Indian Bhaskara Acharya (approximately 1150 AD), more than a thousand years later than Zhao Junqing. Our mathematicians have also been at the forefront of the world in the calculation of pi. Liu Xin of the Han Dynasty (around the beginning of the Common Era) calculated it to be 3.1547; Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) obtained "square root of ten"; Liu Hui (263 AD) obtained 3.14. Zhang Heng's value of pi was obtained much earlier than abroad. The same value is found in the works of the famous Indian mathematician Romanagata (approximately 600 AD) and in later Arabic arithmetic books (approximately 800 AD). Liu Hui's algorithm for pi was based on the progressive algorithm of dividing the circumference into six equal parts, twelve equal parts, and twenty-four equal parts, which already contained the progressive concept of "inscribed polygons approaching a circle." Our algorithm for pi reached its climax with Zu Chongzhi (429-500 AD). The value of pi obtained by Zu Chongzhi was 355/113, and this value was not discovered in the West until the German Otto (1573). Zu Chongzhi's son Zu Gengzhi was also an excellent mathematician. He used geometric methods to obtain the correct relationship between the volume of a sphere and its diameter. Our advanced mathematicians have also made brilliant contributions in algebra. For example, Qin Jiushao's "Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections" (1247 AD) on the root-finding method of high-order equations was more than 500 years earlier than the same invention by Ruffini (1804 AD) and Horner (1819 AD) in the West. Zhu Shijie's "Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns" (1303 AD) on the theory of multivariate polynomials, and "Introduction to Mathematical Studies" (1299 AD) on the theory of series, etc., are all very outstanding scientific contributions. The proposing and solving of these arithmetic problems are closely related to important practical problems such as building dikes, dams, bridges, and buildings.
    Our ancestors paid great attention to the calendar in order to ensure the timely progress of agricultural affairs. To calculate an accurate calendar, detailed astronomical observations and records of astronomical history are required. There have been countless excellent astronomers and calendar makers in our history. There have been countless discoveries and creations of observation techniques. Our ancestors' astronomy and calendar have always been ahead of those of Western countries, and only gradually lagged behind after Copernicus invented the heliocentric theory and Galileo invented the telescope around the 16th century. However, our ancestors left mankind with rich scientific observation records, such as records of Halley's Comet. The world's earliest record is the comet recorded in the Zuo Zhuan in the fourteenth year of Duke Wen of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period (611 BC). Since then, from the seventh year of Qin Shihuang until the second year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty, there have been a total of twenty-nine records (appearing more than once every seventy-six years), each with detailed and accurate records. This comet was discovered in the West by Halley in 1682. Another example is the record of sunspots, which is also very detailed. There have been more than 1,900 years of records since Emperor Cheng of Han. These records are of very important value for the scientific research of sunspots. In the West, this phenomenon was not discovered until the 17th century after the telescope was applied. Other records such as meteors and guest stars are also the richest and most reliable records in human astronomical knowledge.
    Our ancestors also had very excellent performances in mechanics. The appearance of the world's first car was also on the land of our beloved motherland. Legend has it that Xi Zhong made a horse-drawn carriage during the time of Yu, which was 4,000 years ago. In 231 AD, Zhuge Liang created wooden oxen and flowing horses to overcome the difficulty of transporting grain on small mountain roads. It is said to be the commonly seen wheelbarrow, commonly known as Jiangzhou cart. Jiangzhou County is in Sichuan, and Zhuge Liang probably made these carts there at that time. These creations were far earlier than those in the West and relieved our people of a lot of hard work and corvee. Our shipbuilding engineering also has glorious achievements in history. The most famous is the five-toothed giant ship built by Yang Su in the Sui Dynasty. It had five floors, was more than a hundred feet high, and could accommodate more than 800 people. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty sent envoys to the West (1405 AD) and built a fleet of 62 large ships. Each ship was 44 zhang long and 18 zhang wide, and could accommodate more than 4,000 soldiers. Zheng He's mission went as far as across the Indian Ocean and to the coast of East Africa. These great navigation feats were eighty or ninety years earlier than the era of Columbus.
    Our ancestors invented textile machinery very early. The creation of silk reeling machines and looms probably coincided with the development of the silk industry, at least 4,000 years ago. After continuous improvement, textile machinery became more advanced and complex year by year. By around 1300 AD, China's textile industry was unparalleled in the world. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Chinese textiles were still the main commodities in Europe. Here, we must mention an excellent female engineer, the wife of Chen Baoguang of Julu during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han (86-74 BC). She created a jacquard machine for weaving figured silk, with one machine using 120 threads and being able to weave one bolt of silk in sixty days. This jacquard machine was the basis for many later weaving machines.
    Our ancestors also made great contributions to the ordnance industry. We probably invented gunpowder in the 12th century. During the reign of Emperor Aizong of Jin, guns loaded with gunpowder were used to defeat the Yuan soldiers. Also, during the Jin-Yuan war in Kaifeng, both sides used artillery. Later, during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1398 AD), Yuan prince Timur Wang Samar Khan used artillery in the Western Regions and was powerful for some time. Europeans who served as soldiers under him took firearms back, and it was then that they were introduced to Europe.
    Our ancestors invented important fuels for mankind. We knew how to use charcoal 4,000 years ago, which is said to have been invented by Zhurong. The Geography of the Former Han Book mentioned the use of coal, which was around 200 BC at that time. During the same period, combustible petroleum was also discovered in the areas of present-day Yanchang in northern Shaanxi and Jiuquan in Gansu. However, the use of coal in Europe was after the 12th century, probably knowledge brought back by Marco Polo. Natural gas was also first discovered in Xufu, Sichuan by us (Qin Shihuang era), but it was not known how to use it without the danger of explosion. Later, in the notes of the Song people, there was a saying of using bamboo pipes to extract it for boiling salt, overcoming the difficulty of explosion. The period of using natural gas as fuel was probably before the 12th century, which was the same era as when the Russians discovered the sacred fire in Baku. It was several centuries earlier than when the British began to use it for lighting in 1668.
    Our country has always had rich cultural classics to record the history of the growth and development of this great nation. In the very early days, bamboo slips were mostly used, and later silk, but silk was too expensive and slips too heavy, and it was not the best medium for transmitting culture after all. It was not until Cai Lun of the Eastern Han Dynasty (105 AD) overcame this difficulty and designed to use bark, hemp heads, rags, and fishing nets to make pulp into paper. However, transmitting culture in this way still required mutual copying, and could not be widely promoted. In the Sui Dynasty (around 593 AD), our ancestors invented the technology of woodblock printing. After this technology became popular, it was improved very finely in the Song Dynasty. Around the time of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty (1041-1048 AD), the genius Bi Sheng invented movable type printing. At that time, clay type or tile type was used; later, lead type and tin type were used. Wang Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty began to use wood type; during the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty and the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, copper type was used. At that time (1662-1721 AD), the method of making characters and typesetting was very perfect. These genius inventions and creations of our ancestors were far ahead of all countries in the world. For example, other countries had paper around 793 AD in Persia, 900 AD in Egypt, 1189 AD in France, and 1276 AD in Italy. Looking at the development of these eras and regions, the fact that paper was transmitted from China in the East to countries around the world is probably not wrong. Western printing technology was also far behind China. The period when the West first had woodblock books was probably from 1418 to 1440 AD, which was three or four hundred years later than us. The West had movable type in 1763, which was seven hundred years later than us.
    Our motherland has a rich historical heritage and incomparably brilliant scientific creations. These historical facts cannot be written or spoken completely in a few thousand words. Just what has been said is enough to prove the historical glory and greatness of China. "The Chinese people have often been at the forefront of world culture for thousands of years, and only fell behind Europeans in the last hundred years." The reasons for this backwardness are nothing more than the aggression and brutal oppression of China by capitalist and imperialist countries, and the corruption, ignorance, and abetting of the reactionary ruling class. Today, we have liberated ourselves. The fact that the great Chinese working people are combined with Marxism-Leninism enables the Chinese people to quickly understand their own strength and wisdom. We proudly inherit this brilliant heritage. We love this great motherland with a history of five thousand years. We will forever labor endlessly and create continuously on this land to enrich our bright future.

　　中国古代的科学创造
    清华大学教授  钱伟长
    我们伟大的祖国，有着优秀的丰富的历史遗产。我们的祖先们数千年来，在这广大的东亚大陆上，不断地劳动着，创造着，与自然搏斗着，以刻苦耐劳的劳动生活，光辉优秀的科学创造，为我们四亿七千五百万子孙，留下了这样一份沃富美丽的江山和光荣无比的历史。我们每一个中国人民，都为我们的祖国骄傲，为我们祖国的历史骄傲。我们热爱我们伟大的祖国，更热爱我们祖国的光荣历史，我们一定能继承祖先们的优秀传统，以不断的劳动和不断的创造，来使美丽的祖国更美丽，使光荣的历史更光荣。
    现在让我们崇敬地综合叙述一下祖先们在这片土地上和自然搏斗的光辉创造。
    我们的祖先，数千年来，一直主要地从事于农业劳动，今天在祖国的领土上，有着广大的肥田沃地，供给我们以衣食，并不是偶然的，而是中国人民数千年来和自然不断搏斗的结果。这场长期的搏斗，包括着收集野兽飞禽，饲养成家畜；收集山野植物，栽培成谷物；不断和洪水搏斗等光荣的历史。在这种与自然搏斗的历史里，有许多伟大和优秀的科学家、工程师和发明家，他们光荣地创造着，为人民累积了许多科学经验，来丰富人民的生活。
    在很早的时候，中国人民便已开始种稻，并逐步地改进培植稻谷的科学方法，到现在为止，我们农民有优秀的选种方法和非常科学的农事经验。中国的蚕丝是中国人民利用自然、改造自然的最伟大的发明之一。中国人民也从很早的时候起，便培养着野生的豆类食物，成为我们人民的最营养的食物。我国的菜蔬种类之多，也为全世界之冠。到今天为止，欧美各国的主要食物只有肉类、鱼类、麦和少数的菜蔬。但是我们的食物种类繁多，为我们的生活增加了无限的内容。在这些农事的发明里，民间传说着许多伟大的名字，如神农、伏羲、嫘祖等神话似的发明家，这些发明家的出现，早在四五千年以前，虽然他们很多只是留下了象征性的名字，也许他们是代表一个氏族，并无足够的正确史料供查考；但是，人民不断怀念着这些光辉的发明，和跟人民生活密切联系地创造，并不因为历史的模糊不清，而减少了对他们的尊敬和热爱。
    为了保证农业生产的收获，水利工程是我们祖先科学劳动的中心问题。我们的祖先要和洪水搏斗，主要的是和黄河搏斗；并且要大量地建设灌溉工程。为了在广大的地区进行航运，我们的祖先也大规模地建设着运河和漕运的网路。在这伟大的工程和建设里，更涌现出无数优秀的工程师，累积了丰富无比的科学经验。
    在传说上人民所最拥戴的水利工程师是禹。当时黄河在华北各区还没有像今日这种的水道，由昆仑东流的水源，汇成最大的水量，形成“洪水滔滔，天下沉积”的洪水泛滥的局面，高地和山陵被水分划成一块块的洲陆和岛屿似的。在这种自然力支配下，我们的祖先以当时较低的生产力，来进行克服水患的治水工作，实在不是容易的事情。传说禹接受了前人鲧治水失败的教训，顺着水性，因势疏导，领导着人民，一连工作九年（约在公元前二二八六年到二二七八年），逐渐约束了水流，在中国历史上第一回确定了黄河出海的河道。禹的治水工作遍及全国，他那忘我的工作热忱，九年中三过家门而不入，表现了为人民服务的优秀民族传统。
    禹的治水工作，初步地克服了严重的水患，为我国民族打下了在这片土地上生息繁殖的基础，但是黄河从上游带着大量的沙粒疾行而下，到了下游，人民都引河水灌田，使河流慢下来，以至入海的出口，渐渐淤塞，于是一到水涨，就不时溢出，造成水患。这样的情形，一直到王莽时（公元九年至二二年），有位长安人民张戎科学地指出了水流流速与沙淤的关系。这个科学的结论，为以后有名的水利工程师王景（汉明帝，公元六九年）、贾鲁（金泰定，公元一三五一年）、潘季驯（明嘉靖，公元一五六五年）、靳辅（清康熙，公元一六七七年）等治河的基本原则。他们根据这个原则，创造了“筑堤束水，借水攻沙”的治水方法。这些工程师们在坚决地执行这个原则时，克服了不少工程上的困难，发动着万千百的人民群众，完成了不少伟大的修渠筑堤工程。这些伟大的工程师们在施工时，都和参加的人民密切地结合着；潘季驯在工事紧急时，带着背疽和群众一起工作，鼓励着大家，坚定了工作的情绪，使河工转危为安。他们在工作时，还要时时把治河的道理向群众宣传，他们也科学地总结了工作的经验；如贾鲁的同伴欧阳玄，便写了一本“至正河防记”（公元一三六○年），很详细而有系统地叙述着治堤、治埽等各种水利工程的内容，为人类第一本有系统的水利工程著作。
    我国既有这样广大的领土，内陆水运是非常重要的事情，我们的祖先，以辛勤的劳动，四千年来，在全国范围内，开凿了无数的运河和航道。譬如春秋时代吴国的伍员（公元前四九五年）便以太湖为中心，领导着人民，开凿了长江下游三角洲的运河网。一直到今天，在不断地疏浚修补后，还是为人民享用着。譬如秦始皇时的史禄（公元前二一五年），在湖南兴安县东面，开凿灵渠，沟通了湖南、广西的水路交通；在兴安县附近，地势较高，有湘江和漓江发源在这里，湘江北流，漓江南流，但是并不接头；史禄科学地利用水力，以累级加水闸的办法，开凿灵渠，长六十里，设三十六道闸，沟通了南北航运。在这样早的年代有这样天才的发明，我们感觉得无上的骄傲。这个渠道，在马援时期，明叶末年等，都曾浚修加宽，在南北交通上，有着优越的贡献。
    我国既有发达的农业，灌溉工程的成就当然也是写不胜写的。我们现在提出一个比较著名的灌溉水利工程，来说明我们祖先的伟大。秦惠王时，蜀太守李冰和他的儿子二郎，于四川灌县西南凿了离堆，引水分流内外两江，在分水地点，做了一个全国闻名的都江堰，调节水流。这个工程，灌溉了成都附近十几县的田畴。使成都变成了“天府之国”。这个工程在万难中施工完成之后，科学地总结了调节水流的原则，在石上刻了“深淘滩，低作堰”六个大字。这个科学的结论颇为后人珍视。当地人民为了热爱着这位伟大的工程师，在都江堰立祠纪念，便是有名的二郎庙。现在每年四月一日开堰时，都举行隆重的典礼。
    我们的水利工程是服务于农业的，我们的数学发展也是服务于农业的。优秀的中国人民，在很早的年代（传说是伏羲氏），便发明和选用了十进制的数字，和“九九”乘法歌诀。这歌诀一直到现在，还在一字不错地沿用着。在春秋秦汉之间，为计算田亩的大小、赋税的多寡、和粮食的运输管理，创作了有名的“九章算术”（大概在公元四五十年间）和“周髀算经”（公元前一○○年间）。在这两本书里，总结着这一时代优秀的中国算学家如张苍（公元前二○○年）、耿寿昌（公元前五○年）、许商、杜忠（公元前二三十年）等的天才创造。他们已经运用着单分数、多元一次方程式、二元二次方程式、等差级数等代数问题，和圆周率等于三、正三角形的勾三股四弦五等几何问题。以后天才的数学家赵君卿，用几何证明了正三角形的勾方加股方等于弦方的有名定律。这个定律的证明，在其他各国最早的是印度人巴斯卡剌·阿刻雅（公元一一五○年），比赵君卿晚了一千多年。我国的数学家们，在圆周率的算法上，也走在世界的前列。汉刘歆（公元前后）算出来是三·一五四七；张衡（公元七八——一三九年）得“开方十”；刘徽（公元二六三年）得三·一四。张衡的圆周率，比国外早得很多，在印度的名数学家罗门加塔（公元六○○年左右）的著作中，和此后的亚拉伯算书（公元八○○年左右）中见到同一的数值。刘徽的圆周率算法是根据将圆周六等分、十二等分、二十四等分等渐近算法算得的，已包含着“内接多边形极限成圆”的进步观念。我国的圆周率算法，到祖冲之（公元四二九——五○○）达到了高潮，祖冲之得到的圆周率是一一三分之三五五，这个数值在西洋一直到德人渥脱（一五七三年）才被发现。祖冲之的儿子祖暅之也是一位优秀的算学家，他用几何的方法，求得了圆球体积和直径的正确关系。我国的先进数学家，在代数上也有着辉煌的贡献。如秦九韶所著“数书九章”（公元一二四七年），对于高次方程式之求根法，较西洋鲁飞尼（公元一八○四年）及和涅（公元一八一九年）的同一发明，早了五百多年。朱世杰所著“四元玉鉴”（公元一三○三年）关于多元式的理论，及“算学启蒙”（一二九九年）关于级数论等理论，都是非常卓越的科学贡献。这些算学问题的提出和获得解答，都密切连系着作堤、作坝、造桥、建筑等重要的实际问题。
    我们的祖先为了要保证农事的如期进行，所以对于历法也非常注意。为了要推算正确的历法，便需详密的星象观测，和天文史的记载。我们的历史上有着无数优秀的天文家和历法家。有着无数的发现和观测术的创造。我们祖先的天文历法，一直在西洋各国的前面，到十六世纪前后哥白尼发明了行星绕日，伽利略发明了望远镜，才渐渐落后。但是我们的祖先为人类留下了丰富的科学观测纪录，如哈雷彗星之纪录。世界最早的纪录是春秋鲁文公十四年（公元前六一一年）七月左传所载的彗星。此后自秦始皇七年起一直到清宣统二年共二十九次（每七十六年多出现一次），每次都有详尽确实的记载，这个彗星在西洋是哈雷在一六八二年才发现的。又如日斑的纪录，也极详尽。自汉成帝起已有一千九百多年的记载，这些记载，对于日斑的科学研究，有着非常重要的价值。而在西洋，到十七世纪应用望远镜后，才发现这个现象。其他如流星、客星等纪录，在人类的天文知识上，也是最丰富和最可靠的纪录。
    我们的祖先在机械方面，也有着非常优秀的表现。世界上第一辆车的出现，也是在我们所热爱的祖国的土地上。传说禹时奚仲作马车，这是四千年以前的事。诸葛亮在公元二三一年，为了克服山地小路运粮的困难，而创造了木牛流马。据说就是现在常见的独轮车，俗称江州车子，四川有江州县，大概当时诸葛亮在那里制造了这些车子。这些创造远在西洋之先，为我国人民解除了不少辛劳和苦役。我们的造船工程在历史上也有着光辉的成绩。最著名的，如隋代杨素制造的五牙大舰，有五层楼，高百余尺，可以容纳八百余人。明朝的郑和，通使西洋（公元一四○五年），一共造了六十二艘大船的舰队。每艘长四十四丈，宽十八丈，容将士四千多人。郑和的使节一直远越印度洋，直抵东菲海岸。这些伟大的航海事迹，比哥伦布的时代，还早着八九十年。
    我们的祖先很早便发明了纺织的机械。缫车和机杼的创造，大概和蚕业发展同时，最少也有四千年了。以后在不断的改进下，纺织的机械，便一年比一年进步和复杂。到公元一千三百年左右，中国的纺织工业，是世界无匹的。在明末清初的时候，中国的纺织品，还是欧洲的主要商品。在这里，我们必需要提出一位优秀的女工程师，汉昭帝时（公元前八六——七四年）巨鹿人陈宝光的妻子，她创造了一架织花绫的提花机，一机用一百二十条线，六十天便可以织成一匹。这种提花机便是以后许多布机的张本。
    我们的祖先在兵工上也有伟大的贡献。我们大概在十二世纪内发明了火药。金哀宗时，用装放火药的枪，击溃了元兵；又金元在开封交战时，双方都用了火炮；此后在明洪武年间（公元一三六八——一三九八年）元驸马铁木儿王撒马儿罕在西域一带利用火炮，强盛了一些时候。欧洲人在他部下当兵的，带了火器回去，才传到了欧洲。
    我们的祖先为人类发明了重要燃料。我们在四千年前便懂得用炭，相传是祝融发明的。前汉书地理志内便提到了用煤的事情，那时在公元前二○○年左右。同时期在现在的陕北延长和甘肃酒泉一带，也发现了可燃的石油。但是煤在欧洲的引用，是十二世纪以后的事，大概是马哥孛罗带回去的知识。天然煤气也是我们在四川叙府首先发现的（秦始皇时代），当时不知道怎样用它，才可以不生爆炸的危险。以后在宋人的笔记上，才有用竹管接出煮盐的说法，克服了爆炸的困难。而用天然煤气为燃料的时期，大概在十二世纪以前，这和俄国人在巴库地方，发现圣火，在同一时代。比英国在一六六八年，才开始用以供点灯之用，又早几个世纪了。
    我国一直有着丰富的文化典籍，来记载这个伟大民族的生长和发展的历史。在很早的时候，多用竹简，以后用缣帛，但是缣太贵，简太重，终究不是传递文化的最好媒介。一直到东汉蔡伦（公元一○五年）才克服了这种困难，设计用树皮、麻头、破布及鱼网做浆成纸。但是这样传递文化还要互相抄录，并不能普及推广。在隋代（公元五九三年间），我们的祖先发明了雕板印刷的技术。这种技术开始通行后，到宋代便改进得非常精美了。大约在宋仁宗时代（公元一○四一——一○四八年间），天才的毕升，发明了活字板印刷。那时用胶泥字或瓦字；以后改用铅字、锡字，元朝王祯开始用木字；明朝弘治年间及清朝康熙年间更用铜字。那时（公元一六六二——一七二一年）制字排版的方法，已很完美。我们祖先这些天才的发明和创造，都远在世界各国之先。如他国有纸的时期，大约波斯在公元七九三年，埃及在公元九○○年，法国在公元一一八九年，意大利在公元一二七六年，看这些年代和地域的发展，纸是从东方中国传到世界各国的事实，大概是不会错误的。西洋的印刷术，亦远在中国的后面，大概西洋初有木版书的时期是公元一四一八到一四四○年，和我们差了三四百年；西洋有活字版，是在一七六三年，又比我们晚了七百年。
    我们祖国有着丰富的历史遗产，有着光辉无比的科学创造。这些史实，不是几千字所能写得尽、说得完的。就所说的这一些，已足以证明历史上中国的光辉伟大。“中国人民在几千年中经常居于世界文化的前列，只是在近一百多年间才落于欧洲人之后。”造成这种落后的原因，不外是资本主义和帝国主义国家对中国的侵略和残酷的压迫，和反动统治阶级的腐朽无知和助纣为虐。今天，我们已经解放了自己，伟大的中国劳动人民与马克思列宁主义相结合的事实，使中国人民迅速地了解了自己的力量和智慧。我们骄傲地继承着这笔光辉的遗产，我们热爱着这个有五千年历史的伟大祖国，我们将永远在这片土地上无休止地劳动，和不断地创造，来丰富我们光明的前途。
