　　Production, Martial Arts, and Cultural Learning
　  ——Letter from Lu'cheng County (Shanxi) Militia Hero Huang Xiaodan
    Comrade Editor:

    Since returning from the meeting in Beijing, I have mainly focused on the following three tasks. Now I am writing to you to report on my work and the achievements I have made.

    (1) Organized the militia to engage in winter production, earning seventy dan, five dou, and five sheng of grain. At the beginning of winter production, to overcome the masses' idea of idleness in winter, a militia meeting for the whole village was held (attended by 130 people), where a production plan was discussed and specifically formulated. Our village militia organized an adobe brick-making team, a cotton ginning and batting team, and an oil pressing team. They also contracted to build kilns and transport coal. In addition, we organized two blacksmiths to make iron tools, adding ninety-six agricultural implements. Under the influence of the militia, the masses in the whole village also enthusiastically participated in winter production.

    (2) Led the winter training of the militia, combining production and martial arts. After accepting the winter training task, I first worked with the village militia cadres to study and develop a winter training plan. Then, I convened a meeting of young militia members to implement the winter training work. We used examples of sabotage activities by reactionary Daoist sects in various places to educate everyone. We explained that if we do not step up martial arts training, maintain public security, and strictly guard against sabotage by counter-revolutionaries, our lives will still not be good. In this way, we inspired everyone's awareness of martial arts training. Our village militia, with four squads, took turns practicing martial arts by production team; and we also gathered for a large-scale practice once a month. This not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient weapons, but also allowed us to combine it with winter production. Through this winter's martial arts training, every militiaman learned shooting skills.

    (3) Organized cultural learning. When I was in Beijing for the meeting, I made a plan: I myself would learn two new characters a day, and learn to write simple letters and reports this winter; and I would organize the masses to run winter schools well. After returning from the meeting, I proposed to all the militiamen in the village: "We have three tasks this winter: production, martial arts, and cultural learning. These three tasks are very important, and we cannot do without any of them." Everyone agreed with my opinion and enthusiastically engaged in cultural learning. All 168 young people and militiamen in the village participated in winter school and completed the learning plan.

　　生产、练武、学文化
　  ——山西潞城民兵英雄黄小旦来信
    编辑同志：
    我从北京开会回来以后，主要作了以下三项工作。现在我把工作情况和得到的成绩告诉你们。
    （一）组织民兵进行冬季生产，赚米七十石五斗五升。冬季生产将开始时，为克服群众的冬闲思想，召开了全村民兵会议（参加会议者一百三十人），讨论并具体订出生产计划。我村民兵组织了捣土坯小组，轧花、弹花和油坊小组，还包工打窑房、运煤。此外，我们还组织了两个铁匠打铁，添置农具九十六件。全村群众在民兵的影响下，也都热烈地参加了冬季生产。
    （二）领导民兵冬训，并使生产和练武结合。我接受冬训任务后，便和本村民兵干部先研究出冬训计划，然后又召开了青年民兵会议，贯彻冬训工作。我们用各地反动道门破坏活动的实例来教育大家。说明如果我们不加紧练武，维护治安，严防反革命分子破坏，我们的光景还是过不好。这样，启发了大家的练武自觉。我们全村民兵四个小队，以生产小组为单位，轮流练武；每月还集合起来大练一次。这样既克服了武器不够用的困难，又能结合进行冬季生产。经过今冬练武，全村民兵个个学会了射击技术。
    （三）组织文化学习。我在北京开会时，就订出计划：我自己一天要学会两个生字，在今冬学会写简单的信和报告；并组织群众办好冬学。开会回来，我就向全村民兵提出：“我们今冬有三件工作：生产、练武、学文化。这三件工作都很重要，缺少那一件也不行。”大家都同意我的意见，热烈进行文化学习。全村青年及民兵一百六十八人，全部参加了冬学，并完成了学习计划。
