            Paper National Flags Should Cease Printing and Sales
    Mr. Xuan Jiaren's letter raises concerns about the hanging and sale of paper national flags, stating: "There is a tradition in our country of hanging paper 'national flags' in public places, which I believe is not good. First, according to past customs, paper national flags are a kind of decoration, and are mostly hung at private wedding celebrations and entertainment venues. This is disrespectful to the national flags of our country and friendly countries. Second, putting the national flags of our country, the Soviet Union, and the new democratic countries together with the national flags of imperialist countries is not only meaningless, but will also create a bad influence among the people, making it difficult to distinguish between friends and enemies. Third, paper national flags have no practical use other than as decorations, because truly international gatherings, in addition to hanging larger cloth national flags of the relevant countries, do not use paper national flags. Therefore, for this kind of decoration that only has disadvantages and no practical use, I suggest that it should no longer be printed and sold. Secondly, in addition to paper national flags, many stationery stores also print and sell larger national flags of various countries, and the colors and patterns of these national flags often do not meet the prescribed standards, which is also very inappropriate. I believe that in addition to prohibiting the printing and sale of paper national flags, the printing of national flags of various countries should be subject to review by a certain agency to show solemnity."
    Editor's Note: We completely agree with this opinion; at the same time, as far as we know, the General Administration of Publications has notified the local news and publication bureaus (offices) to inform the publishing institutions and sales stores to stop printing and selling paper national flags. Regarding the printing standards and review methods for national flags of various countries, we also hope that the relevant administrative departments will formulate and announce them as soon as possible.
            An Error in "Hong Xiuquan"
    Mr. Ma Xueliang wrote, saying: "I occasionally browsed a comic book published by Wende Bookstore: "Hong Xiuquan," which is a very beneficial book for children, but on page 44, the Yao ethnic group is still written as '猺民' (Yao Min), which is a very serious mistake (at least an oversight). I suggest that Wende Bookstore quickly correct this error in this book, and I also hope that all publishers will pay attention to it."
    Editor's Note: Mr. Ma's suggestion deserves the widespread attention of publishers. We hope that in all publications, not only in content but also in naming, respect will be given to fraternal ethnic groups.
            Cixi's Photos Should Not Be Sold as Scenery Pictures
    Mr. Ren Jun wrote: "In places such as the Summer Palace in Beijing, in the sale of photos of famous scenic spots in Beijing, the photos of 'Empress Dowager Cixi' are actually sold as 'scenic spots', which is very inappropriate. Empress Dowager Cixi was the head of the stubborn faction in the corrupt and dim Qing Dynasty who held real power, one of the representatives of the feudal ruling class, and also one of the foreign slaves who repeatedly kowtowed to imperialism, ceded land for peace, and was actually a tool for imperialism to exploit and oppress the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. The vast number of Chinese working people will not miss her. We should not let such an enemy who cruelly exploited the Chinese people 'be passed down to future generations'. We hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to correcting this."

            纸制万国旗应该停止印售
    宣教仁先生来信对纸制万国旗的悬挂和印售提出意见，说：“我国向有在公共场所悬挂纸制‘万国旗’的风气，我以为这种风气是不好的。第一，按照过去习惯，纸制万国旗是一种点缀品，悬挂地点多为私人婚庆喜事和娱乐场所，这样对本国和友好国家的国旗是不够尊重的。第二，把我国、苏联和新民主主义国家的国旗与帝国主义国家的国旗挂在一起，不但毫无意义，而且会在人民群众中造成敌友不分的不良影响。第三，纸制万国旗除了作为点缀品外，并没有实际的用处，因为真正国际性的集会，除了悬挂有关国家的较大型的布质国旗，并不用纸制的万国旗。因此，对于这种只有害处而没有实际用处的点缀品，我建议不应再行印售。其次，除了纸质的万国旗外，也有许多文具店印制和出售较大型的各国国旗的，这些国旗的颜色和图案往往不合规定标准，这也是很不妥当的。我以为除了禁止印售纸制万国旗外，对于各国国旗的印制应该经过一定机关予以审定，以昭郑重。”                             
    编者按：我们完全同意这一意见；同时，据我们知道，关于纸制万国旗，已由出版总署通知各地新闻出版局（处）转告各出版机构及销售商店停止印制和出售。关于各国国旗的印制标准和审定办法，也希望有关行政部门从速规定，予以公布。
            《洪秀全》中的一个错误
    马学良先生来信，说：“我偶尔翻阅了文德书局出版的一本连环画：《洪秀全》，是对于儿童的一本很有益的小书，但书中四四页还将傜民族写作‘猺民’，是一个很严重的错误（至少是一个疏忽）。我建议文德书局赶快把这本书的这一错误改正，同时希望各出版家也予以注意。”                  
    编者按：马先生的建议值得出版者普遍注意，希望在一切出版物中，不只在内容上，而且在称谓上尊重兄弟民族。
            慈禧照片不应当作风景片卖
    任俊先生来信：“北京颐和园等地，在销售北京名胜、风景区照片中，竟把‘慈禧太后’的照片，也当做‘名胜’来销售，这是很不妥当的。慈禧太后是腐败昏黯的满清皇朝掌握着实权的顽固派的魁首，是封建统治阶级代表之一，也是屡次向帝国主义屈膝献媚、割地求和的洋奴之一，并实际上是帝国主义搜括压榨中国人民血汗的工具。广大的中国劳动人民不会怀念她的。对于这样一个残酷剥削过中国人民的敌人，我们是不应该去让她‘流传芳世’的。希望有关方面注意纠正。”
