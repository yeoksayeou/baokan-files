    These medical workers have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism in their applications, resolutely requesting permission to work on the Korean front. The Guanxian Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society said in a telegram to the head office: "All applicants are full of enthusiasm, and it is inconvenient to make a selection, so all are reported to the head office for review." Eighteen applicants from the Changzhou and Luoyang Branches have already come to Beijing to await approval.
    This wave of enthusiasm for enrollment is continuing to rise across the country. After being reviewed and approved by the Chinese Red Cross Society, the medical workers who have already applied will be notified to come to Beijing for centralized organization into the "Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team" to go to work in Korea. To facilitate the enrollment procedures for medical workers in various places, the Chinese Red Cross Society stipulates: those near a Red Cross branch may apply to the branch nearby; those working in an institution must obtain a letter of introduction with administrative consent; those not working in an institution must obtain a certificate from a local medical workers' organization or a government above the district level.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Medical workers of the Guangzhou Red Cross Society Branch enthusiastically responded to the call of the Red Cross Society and formed two volunteer medical teams to Korea. The two teams left Guangzhou on the 22nd to go to Beijing and then depart for the Korean front. The two teams were led by Zeng Cijun and Huang Chaohan, respectively. The team members included five doctors, as well as laboratory technicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other personnel, totaling 26 people.
