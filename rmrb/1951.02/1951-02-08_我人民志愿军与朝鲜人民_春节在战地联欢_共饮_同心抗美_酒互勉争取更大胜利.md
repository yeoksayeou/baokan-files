　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting on the Korean front is celebrating the victorious Spring Festival of 1951 with the Korean people in the battlefield. The songs of "The East is Red" and "General Kim Il-sung" have enlivened many Korean mountain villages. Slogans plastered all over the streets and roads cheer the great leaders of the Chinese and Korean people, cheer the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people, and call on people to strive for greater victory.
    Before the Spring Festival, the political organs at all levels of the Volunteer Army issued instructions in advance, teaching the soldiers to cherish the interests of the Korean people, respect the customs and habits of the Korean people, and carry out mass discipline inspections. The exemplary actions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers have won universal praise from the Korean people. They call the Volunteer Army "Yangban" army. This honorable title commonly used by the Korean people means that the Volunteer Army is not only a brave and good fighting army, but also a well-disciplined army.
    Everywhere the Volunteer Army is stationed, you can see the Chinese Volunteer Army soldiers and Korean residents celebrating like family. The Volunteer Army cordially invites the landlords and resident government cadres to share "United Against America" wine. The Korean people also send their precious rice cakes to the tables of the Chinese Volunteer Army soldiers. Villagers in a certain area specially erected two tall pine archways and presented the Volunteer Army with a silk banner with the words: "Glory Belongs to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" Kim Kwan-bok, chairman of the People's Committee of a certain village, said gratefully: "We can spend this reunion year, this victorious year, all thanks to the contributions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades. With the help of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese people, we will definitely liberate our motherland." The Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers said to the Korean residents: "Spring is coming, we will wipe out more enemies." The Chinese and Korean people, full of combat friendship, are embracing the coming new victory with boundless confidence, just like the warmth brought by the Spring Festival.

　　我人民志愿军与朝鲜人民
    春节在战地联欢       
    共饮“同心抗美”酒互勉争取更大胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】战斗在朝鲜前线的我国人民志愿部队，正在战地与朝鲜人民欢庆一九五一年胜利的春节。“东方红”和“金日成将军”的歌声，使许多朝鲜山村活跃了起来。贴满街头和路边的标语，都欢呼着中朝人民伟大的领袖，欢呼着中朝人民伟大的胜利，召唤着人们为争取更大的胜利而奋斗。
    在春节之前，志愿军各级政治机关就预先发布了指示，教导战士们爱护朝鲜人民的利益，尊重朝鲜人民的风俗习惯，进行群众纪律检查等项工作。中国人民志愿军战士们的模范行动，获得了朝鲜人民的普遍赞扬。他们把志愿军称为“两班”军，这个朝鲜人民惯用的尊贵的称呼，是说志愿军既是英勇善战的军队，又是纪律严明的军队。
    走过志愿军的每一处驻地，都可以看到中国志愿军战士与朝鲜居民亲如家人的联欢。志愿军亲切的邀请房东和驻地政府干部共饮“同心抗美”酒。朝鲜人民也把自己珍贵的年糕送到中国志愿军战士的餐桌上。某部驻地村民特别扎起两座高大的松彩门，并送给志愿军一个绸制的横幅，上面写着：“光荣属于中国人民志愿军！”某村人民委员长金官卜感激的说：“我们今年能过这个团圆年，胜利年，全靠中国人民志愿军同志们的功劳，有了中国人民志愿军和中国人民的帮助，我们一定能解放我们的祖国。”中国人民志愿军战士们向朝鲜居民说：“春天来了，我们要歼灭更多的敌人。”充满战斗友谊的中朝人民，正像春节带来的温暖一样，抱着无限信心，迎接正在到来的新的胜利。
