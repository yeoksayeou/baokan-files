Xinhua News Agency, 30th—The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Student Federation, issued the following statement today in opposition to the US imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a treaty with Japan and rearm Japan:
　　Recently, US imperialism suffered a shameful and painful defeat in its war of aggression against Korea, and as a result, it is intensifying its plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and further arm Japan. The basic purpose of this US imperialist plot is to rearm Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and make it serve as a new tool of US imperialism for aggression in Asia. This is a complete violation of international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement. This heinous plot has aroused great anger and resolute opposition from Chinese youth and the Chinese people. We Chinese youth and the Chinese people remember very clearly that we defeated the most ferocious enemy, Japanese imperialism, through a long struggle and extremely heavy sacrifices. Therefore, we will never tolerate the United States rearming Japan, reviving Japan's aggressive forces, and continuing to harm the Chinese people. At the same time, this US plot attempts to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder for its aggression and attempts to lead Japan to destruction. Japanese youth and the Japanese people have risen up one after another, protesting the crimes of the United States and demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty through signatures and other forms of struggle, demonstrating their righteous desire to live in peace with Chinese youth and the Chinese people and their unwillingness to repeat the old path of Japanese militarism. It must be pointed out that after the disastrous defeat of US imperialism in the Korean War of aggression, it attempted to salvage its defeat with the shameful plan of rearming Japan. This not only further exposed its determination to be the enemy of the Asian people, but also exposed its outwardly strong but inwardly weak and embarrassed state in the face of the power of the people of the world. The perverse actions of the US imperialists will inevitably be met with a more painful defeat than the one in Korea. We Chinese youth are closely watching the evil plot of the United States to unilaterally conclude a treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, and are fighting to unite the youth and people of Eastern countries and Japan to strive for a comprehensive and just treaty and a non-militaristic democratic Japan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st—More than 2,500 traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, nurses, and professors and students from medical schools in Nanchang held a patriotic demonstration parade on the 29th to resist US aggression and aid Korea and oppose US imperialism's rearming of Japan. Hong Minggui, chairman of the Jiangxi Branch of the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Action Committee of Medical Workers in Central and Southern China, reported at the meeting, calling on medical workers throughout the province to resolutely oppose US imperialism's rearming of Japan, and to further carry out the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea movement, and be prepared to participate in the actual work of anti-aggression at any time. More than 70 doctors and nurses who have signed up to join the medical team to Korea, led by Wang Zigan, an 71-year-old medical professor, participated in the parade wearing white surgical gowns. Doctors from the Catholic-run Nanchang St. Louis Hospital and the Christian-run Nanchang Hospital, as well as female students from the affiliated nursing class, also participated in the parade.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 31st—More than 1,500 faculty, students, and staff from twelve church middle and primary schools in Wuhu held a patriotic anti-American demonstration parade on the afternoon of the 29th. The procession was led by portraits of Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and leaders of people from all over the world. Faculty, students, and staff from various schools held red flags and slogan cartoons, shouting slogans such as "Resolutely support the decision of the Government Administration Council," "Thoroughly eliminate the influence of US imperialist cultural aggression," and "Oppose the US imperialist conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a treaty with Japan." The parade was warmly welcomed by the citizens along the way.

　　反对美帝对日片面媾和及武装日本
    我三大青年组织严正声明   
    南昌医药界和芜湖教会学校师生示威游行
    【新华社三十日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会，为反对美帝国主义对日片面媾和及重新武装日本的阴谋，本日发表声明如下：
    最近美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中，遭到可耻而惨痛的失败，因而加紧片面对日缔结和约和进一步武装日本的阴谋活动。美帝国主义这一阴谋活动的基本目的，是在于重新武装日本，复活日本的军国主义，使之充当美帝国主义在亚洲的新的侵略工具。这是完全违背了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔塔协定等国际协议的。这一罪恶的阴谋，已引起中国青年和中国人民的极大愤怒和坚决反对。我们中国青年和中国人民还很清楚地记得，我们以长期的斗争和极重大的牺牲才打倒了日本帝国主义这个最凶恶的敌人，因此我们决不能容忍美国重新武装日本，复活日本的侵略势力，继续危害中国人民。同时，美国这一阴谋活动是企图将日本人民充当其侵略炮灰，企图引导日本走向毁灭。日本青年与日本人民已经纷纷奋起，以签名和其它方式的斗争，抗议美国的罪行，并要求缔结全面和约，表现了他们愿意与中国青年和中国人民和平相处，绝不愿意重复日本军国主义老路的正义愿望。必须指出，美帝国主义在朝鲜侵略战争中惨败之后，企图用重新武装日本的可耻计划来挽救自己的失败，这不但更加暴露了它与亚洲人民为敌的决心，同时也更加暴露了它在全世界人民力量面前的外强中干的狼狈状况。美帝国主义者的倒行逆施，等待着它的必将是比在朝鲜失败更惨痛的失败。我们中国青年正与全国人民一道，正在密切注视着美国企图对日片面媾和及重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋，并为团结东方各国和日本的青年与人民，争取全面的公正的和约和非军国主义的民主的日本而奋斗。
    【新华社南昌三十一日电】南昌市二千五百多名中西医师、护士和医学校的教授、学生于二十九日举行抗美援朝、反对美帝重新武装日本的爱国示威游行大会。中南医务工作者抗美援朝行动委员会江西分会主席洪明贵在会上报告，号召全省医务工作者坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，并将更进一步开展抗美援朝运动，准备随时参加反侵略的实际工作。已报名参加赴朝医疗队的七十余位医师、护士，由七十一岁的医学老教授王子玕带领，穿着白色手术服参加游行。天主教办的南昌圣类思医院、基督教办的南昌医院的医师和附属护士班的女学生也都参加了游行。
    【新华社芜湖三十一日电】芜湖市十二个教会中、小学校师生员工一千五百余人于二十九日下午举行反美爱国示威大游行。大队以毛主席、斯大林大元帅及世界各国人民领袖像为前导，各校师生员工都手执着红旗和标语漫画牌，沿途高呼：“坚决拥护政务院决定”，“彻底肃清美帝国主义文化侵略影响”，“反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和阴谋”等口号。游行队伍沿途受到市民们热烈欢迎。
