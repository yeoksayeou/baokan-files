Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 3rd: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion on the Soviet Union's accusation of U.S. aggression against China on the afternoon of February 2nd. Although the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, had made a statement to the Political Committee on November 27th, providing detailed evidence to support the Soviet Union's accusation, the United States still forced the debate to be illegally suspended for more than two months.

The Chairman of the Political Committee, U Than Ni, stated at the beginning of the meeting: The Political Committee will simultaneously discuss the Soviet Union's accusation of U.S. aggression against China and a related agenda item – the Soviet Union's accusation of the U.S. Air Force bombing Chinese territory.

The debate began with a statement by the U.S. representative, Austin, who attempted to refute the arguments made by Vyshinsky in his speech on November 27, 1950. He attempted to deny the aggressive and plundering nature of the U.S. armed forces' invasion of Taiwan, deny the U.S. blockade of Taiwan, and insisted that "commercial vessels still freely come and go to Formosa." He also attempted to deny Vyshinsky's other accusations regarding U.S. economic aggression against China.

Regarding Vyshinsky's accusation that the U.S. Air Force systematically appeared in Chinese airspace in the China-North Korea border area, Austin did not deny any of the eighty-three violations listed by the Soviet Union. He offered no defense or explanation for the sixty-one violations of the airspace of the People's Republic of China, saying that these violations were "reconnaissance." Austin concluded by firmly advocating the withdrawal of the accusations against the United States.

The next speaker, Soviet representative Tsarapkin, declared: Because the United States is trying its best to cover up its aggression against China, it is urgently important for the Political Committee to pass the proposal put forward by the Soviet representative on November 27, 1950. The proposal points out that the U.S. invasion of Taiwan and naval blockade constitute acts of aggression, and requests the Security Council to take necessary steps to ensure that the United States immediately ceases its aggression against China. Tsarapkin, in asking for support for the Soviet proposal, emphasized that the United Nations Charter stipulates that all member states shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. He said: U.S. interference in China's territorial integrity, coupled with the threat of armed aggression against China's only legitimate government, is a threat to peace and security. Tsarapkin then exposed the absurdity of the so-called "friendly relations" between the United States and China, as claimed by U.S. representatives Dulles and Austin, as proven historically. In a detailed historical review of U.S. policy toward China, Tsarapkin pointed out that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the United States has been trying to gain control over China in order to completely subjugate China to U.S. monopoly capital. Tsarapkin also refuted Austin's slander that the Soviet Union was trying to gain control over Manchuria. Tsarapkin, in requesting the adoption of the Soviet proposal, said: The United Nations should not tolerate a situation in which a member state of the United Nations—the United States—occupies a part of the territory of another member state of the United Nations. Tsarapkin pointed out that his remarks only referred to one of the two agenda items merged by the Chairman, and he would speak separately later on the other item—the U.S. Air Force bombing China. The Political Committee then announced an adjournment and will reconvene on the afternoon of February 6.

　　联大政委会二日会议
    讨论苏联控诉美国侵略我国案
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二月二日下午继续讨论苏联控诉美国侵略中国案。虽然苏联代表团长维辛斯基曾于十一月二十七日向政治委员会提出声明，详尽地证实了苏联的控诉，然而美国仍迫使辩论非法中止达两个多月。
    政委会主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹在会议开始时说：政委会将同时讨论苏联控诉美国侵略中国案和有连带关系的一项议程——苏联控诉美国空军轰炸中国领土案。
    辩论以美国代表奥斯汀的声明开始，他在这篇声明中企图驳复维辛斯基在一九五○年十一月二十七日的演说中提出的论点。他企图抵赖美国武装部队侵入台湾的侵略掠夺性质，抵赖美国有封锁台湾的情事，硬说“商业船只仍然往自由地来于福摩萨”。他还企图抵赖维辛斯基关于美国对中国进行经济侵略的其他控诉。
    在谈到维辛斯基提出的对于美国空军有计划地出现在中、朝边界地区的中国领空一事的控诉时，奥斯汀并不否认苏联所列举的八十三次侵犯中的任何一次。他对于六十一次侵犯中华人民共和国领空的事件并没有提出任何辩护或解释，他说，这许多次侵犯都是“侦察性的”。奥斯汀在结语中坚决主张撤销对美国的控诉案。
    下一发言者苏联代表查拉普金宣称：由于美国竭力掩饰它对中国的侵略，政委会通过苏联代表在一九五○年十一月二十七日提出的提案实有迫切的重要意义。该提案指出美国侵入台湾和海军封锁构成侵略行为，并要求安理会采取必要步骤，以保证美国立即停止它对中国的侵略。查拉普金在要求大家支持苏联提案时强调说：联合国宪章规定所有会员国不得以武力威胁或使用武力侵害任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。他说：美国对中国领土完整的干涉，加之对中国的唯一合法政府施用武装侵略的威胁，是对和平与安全的威胁。查拉普金接着揭露美国代表杜勒斯和奥斯汀所称美国和中国之间的“友好关系”在历史方面已得到证明的荒谬谰言。查拉普金在对美国对华政策作详细的历史的检讨时指出：在整个十九世纪和二十世纪中，美国一直在力图取得对中国的统治，以便使中国完全屈服于美国垄断资本之下。查拉普金也驳斥奥斯汀所称苏联力图取得对满洲的统治的谰言。查拉普金在要求通过苏联提案时说：联合国不应当容忍联合国的一个会员国——美国——占领另一个联合国会员国的一部分领土这样一种情况。查拉普金指出，他这番话只说到主席所合并的两项议程中的一项，他以后还要就其他一项——美国空军轰炸中国——单独发言。政委会接着宣布休会，二月六日下午复会。
