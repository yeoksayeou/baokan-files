    Turned-Over Peasants in Lingtian, Suichuan and Other Places Help Peasants in Jinggang Mountain with Production
    To the Editor:
    The land reform in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, is proceeding smoothly. Influenced by the revolutionary spirit of Jinggang Mountain, the peasants of Suichuan have come to understand the principle that "peasants all over the world are one family" through actual struggle. Seeing that the peasants in Jinggang Mountain had suffered from the Kuomintang's severe devastation for a long time, resulting in poverty, the peasants in Lingtian District of the county took out 3.5 million yuan (RMB), 2,100 jin of grain, and two head of cattle from the fruit distribution to help the peasants in Jinggang Mountain restore production. When the peasants of Bizhou Township in the ninth district held a meeting, they also decided to give the money from rent reduction and deposit refunds to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in Jinggang Mountain to buy farm tools and livestock.

    遂川灵田等地翻身农民
    帮助井冈山农民生产编辑同志：
    江西遂川县的土地改革，在顺利地进行着。受着井冈山革命精神影响的遂川农民，经过实际斗争，更加懂得了“天下农民是一家”的道理。该县灵田区农民因为看到井冈山的农民长期遭受到国民党的严重摧残以致生活贫困的情形，他们在分配果实时就拿出了人民币三百五十万元，谷子二千一百斤，耕牛两头，帮助井冈山农民恢复生产。九区碧洲乡的农民开会时，也决定将减租退押得来的钱，送给井冈山烈属、军属买农具和牲畜。
