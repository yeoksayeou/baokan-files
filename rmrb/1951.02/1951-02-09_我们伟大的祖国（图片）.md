    Our Great Motherland
    The Temple of Heaven in Beijing was built in 1420. Every year, feudal emperors came here during the winter solstice to pray for a good harvest. The Altar of Prayer for Good Harvests is the main part of the Temple of Heaven. It is built of white stone and exquisitely carved. The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests on the altar is a circular, three-tiered high hall, covered with blue glazed tiles. In the hall, large beams are interwoven with square wood, carved with patterns, and colored like algae, called "caisson." This is a very sophisticated architectural art.

    北京的天坛建筑于一四二○年，封建帝王每年冬至节到这里祈求五谷丰登。这个祈谷坛是天坛的主要部分，用白石砌成，雕琢精美。坛上祈年殿是圆形的三层高殿，上盖青琉璃瓦，殿中大栋间，用方木交织，刻着花纹，施以彩色，和水藻一般，名叫“藻井”。这是非常精巧的建筑艺术。
