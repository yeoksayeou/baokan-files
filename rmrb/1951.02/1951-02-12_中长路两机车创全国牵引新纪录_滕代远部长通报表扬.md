　　Mid-Long Railway Two Locomotives Set New National Traction Record
　  Minister Teng Daiyuan Issues Commendation

    [Our Dispatch] The "Youth" and "1157" locomotives of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Mid-Long Railway have successively set new national locomotive over-axle records by pulling 4,174 tons and 4,343 tons respectively. Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways issued a circular to all railway bureaus and railway engineering bureaus across the country on January 19 to commend them.

    On December 25 last year, during the patriotic over-axle competition, the "Youth" locomotive pulled 93 freight cars weighing 4,174 tons from Daguantun to Sujiatun. This not only exceeded the standard traction weight of locomotives in Northeast China by more than double, setting a new national record, but also arrived safely three minutes ahead of schedule, saving 561 catties of coal. Subsequently, on New Year's Day this year, the "1157" locomotive created a new record by pulling 4,343 tons.

    The emergence of the two locomotives' new over-axle records is inseparable from Comrade Na Xianggui, an excellent guiding driver from Sujiatun. In previous production competitions, Comrade Na Xianggui always took the lead in promoting the movement and creating many new working methods and systems. From January to November last year, the entire locomotive crew of the "Sujiatun Model Locomotive Team" he organized safely traveled 743,400 kilometers, prevented 34 serious accidents, saved 1,567 tons of coal, and saved 4,865 liters of oil. It also exceeded the axle weight by 170,517 tons. During this over-axle campaign, some crew members initially felt dissatisfied and lacked confidence in increasing the specified traction by 200 tons. Comrade Na Xianggui personally drove the "1092" locomotive and pioneered a new record of pulling 2,200 tons, exceeding the specified traction by more than double. After this successful demonstration, crews spontaneously launched a wave of over-axle competitions. Every month, more than 100 trains exceeded their axle weight, with the entire section averaging 30,000 tons over axle, making the Sujiatun section the section with the most over-axle tonnage within the Mid-Long Railway Bureau. In particular, at the end of 1950, the "Youth" and "1157" large freight locomotives emerged as over-axle experts, creating the latest national records.

    In his circular, Minister Teng specifically mentioned the five key points proposed by the well-known labor model Li Yong regarding over-axle operations, and requested all bureaus to study and adopt them. The five key points are: 1. Pay attention to the strength of the drawbar. 2. Pay attention to starting and stopping. 3. Pay attention to braking and releasing. 4. Pay attention to the length of the sidings at each station. 5. It should be universally implemented.

### 中长路两机车创全国牵引新纪录  滕代远部长通报表扬

　　中长路两机车创全国牵引新纪录
　  滕代远部长通报表扬
    【本报讯】中长路苏家屯机务段“青年号”及“一一五七号”二台机车，先后以牵引四千一百七十四吨及四千三百四十三吨创全国机车超轴新纪录，铁道部滕代远部长特于一月十九日通令全国各路局及各铁路工程局予以表扬。
    去年十二月二十五日，在爱国主义的超轴竞赛运动中，“青年号”由大官屯开到苏家屯时牵引货车九十三辆，计重四千一百七十四吨，不仅超过了东北机车标准牵引重量一倍以上，创造了全国新纪录，而且提前三分钟安全到达，节省了五百六十一斤煤。继之“一一五七号”又在今年元旦日以牵引四千三百四十三吨创造了更新的纪录。
    二台机车超轴新纪录的出现是与苏家屯优秀的指导司机那相贵同志不可分的。历次的生产竞赛中，那相贵同志总是带头推动运动开展，并创造了许多新的工作方法和制度。去年一月至十一月，他领导他所组织起来的“苏家屯模范机车队”全体机车包乘组安全行走了七十四万三千四百公里，防止了三十四件恶性事故，省煤一千五百六十七吨，省油四千八百六十五立（等于公升），并超轴十七万零五百十七吨。这次超轴运动中，开始有些乘务员对规定牵引定数提高二百吨感到不满和没有信心，那相贵同志就亲自驾驶“一○九二号”机车，首创牵引二千二百吨超过牵引定数一倍以上的新纪录。在这次示范成功后，各组乘务员都自动掀起了超轴竞赛的热潮，每月都有一百多个列车超轴，全段平均超轴三万吨，使得苏家屯段成为中长局管内超轴最多的一段。特别是一九五○年底，更出现了大型货运机车“青年号”、“一一五七号”两包乘组超轴能手，创造了全国最新纪录。
    滕部长在通令中特别提出了著名劳动模范李永建议关于超轴应注意的五项要点，要求各局研究采纳。五要点是：一、注意车钩强度。二、注意起车停车。三、注意制动和缓解。四、注意各站股道长。五、要能普遍实行。
