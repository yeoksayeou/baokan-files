　　"No Man's Land" and "Human Cage"
    ——Recalling the Bloody Atrocities of the Japanese Aggressors' "Concentrated Relocation of Villages"
    Chen Ji

　　In the spring of 1942, the invading Japanese aggressors began "concentrated relocation of villages." Along the Great Wall, stretching over 700 *li* from Gubeikou to Shanhaiguan, in an area spanning fifty to sixty *li* north and south, and covering approximately 42,000 square *li*, the Japanese aggressors forced every Chinese person who had grown up there to relocate to areas designated by the Japanese. The enemy adopted a "kill all, burn all, loot all" policy, attempting to create an unprecedentedly brutal "no man's land" in this vast area in order to maintain their fascist rule.

　　The heroic people of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region responded to the enemy with resolute struggle. Simultaneously with the enemy's "concentrated relocation of villages," the local people's resistance against the Japanese aggressors also began. In this area, the enemy conducted "sweeps" and searches every day, killing people, burning houses, and taking livestock in the ravines and on the mountaintops. Every village designated within the "no man's land" suffered nearly ten instances of burning and killing by the enemy. Majiagou in eastern Hebei, comprising only four small villages, endured fourteen enemy "sweeps." The people of Majiagou were unyielding, hiding in ditches and caves, enduring hunger and cold as they struggled with the enemy. When the enemy left, they built thatched huts on the destroyed ruins; when the enemy burned the huts again, the fearless people rebuilt them, only to have them burned again.... After countless such cruel struggles, the people of Majiagou eventually moved into mountain caves to continue their struggle. The enemy built碉堡 (blockhouses) on every mountain peak, firing incessantly at the slightest glimpse of a person. No "figures" could be seen in Majiagou, but the people hidden in the caves of Majiagou were still fighting. The enemy unleashed countless police dogs to search for traces of people; the enemy also insidiously hid, pretending to have left Majiagou, and then brutally slaughtered people when they emerged from the caves. The people in the caves had no choice but to continue hiding, daring not to light fires or make any noise. Mothers did not allow their children to leave their breasts; when some children cried, mothers, fearing that the enemy would hear, had to tearfully strangle their children to protect the safety of the people inside the cave. People had no clothes to wear, with several people sharing a single pair of pants; they had no food, so they had to secretly gather wild vegetables, grasses, and tree leaves outside the cave to stave off hunger. One woman, carrying her child on her back, went out of the cave to look for wild vegetables and was captured by the enemy not far away. She was held down by fifteen enemies and gang-raped, with the child resting beside her. The enemy asked her, "Where are they?" She did not answer. The enemy cut off her left nipple with a knife, and the bloody nipple landed on the child, who clutched it tightly, crying out in fear, "Mom...". The enemy turned around and hacked the child to death. Of Majiagou's seventy households, a large majority were killed, beaten to death, burned to death, or raped to death by the enemy. The Chinese people in the so-called "no man's land" were thus being destroyed by the enemy. At that time, the beloved wilderness of the motherland became a tragic hell on earth.

　　The people who were driven by the enemy into designated areas to live became like cattle and sheep. They were confined in areas surrounded by strict guard, unable to contact the outside world, unable to communicate with villages nearby, unable to cultivate land more than ten *li* away. The people living here called this place the "human cage." The "human cage" had a tight network of enemy secret agents who formulated bloody regulations such as "thought criminals," "political criminals," "adultery criminals," and "transportation criminals." All men who could bear arms were incorporated into the "self-defense corps," patrolling for the enemy every night, unable to sleep. The members of the "self-defense corps" were also members of the "diligent service" team, each member having to spend fifteen to twenty days each month doing "diligent service" for the enemy: building blockhouses, constructing fortifications, laying railroad tracks, and building roads for cars; sometimes they were even sent to the Northeast for hard labor. Before the labor was completed, they would already be exhausted to death. The enemy established various taxation items to exploit the "human cage." The income of the people in the "human cage" was not enough to pay taxes, and they lived off the enemy's rations, which were three *chi* of cloth per person per year, nine *liang* of flour every six months, and one and a half *jin* of salt every two months. There was nothing else. Everyone's face was pale from hunger, and they lived by digging up wild vegetables and grasses every day.

　　The women in the "human cage" suffered even more devastation. They had to "run the cage" every day: getting up in the morning, leaving their children behind, and gathering outside the cage to run along the perimeter; those who could not run fast were beaten; those who did not run were considered to have committed a crime. Every week, there was also a "mountain running" "training." The enemy gathered them at the foot of the mountain and ordered them to run to the top of the mountain. When they were about to reach the top, the enemy suddenly fired their guns to startle the women for amusement. If someone could not run to the top, they would be considered a "thought criminal" and killed. The enemy raping women became an "open and legal" affair. Those who tried to avoid rape, those who refused rape, were "bandits accomplices" and were brutally murdered by the enemy. The people in the "human cage" will always remember the enemy's "general inspection," during which the enemy massacred a large number of innocent people.

　　Today, the people of the "no man's land" are healing their wounds, and they have not yet had time to settle this blood debt, but they have already heard the news of American imperialism rearming Japan. Their irrepressible flames of anger will turn the vicious conspiracy of American imperialism to ashes. (Attached Image)

　　“无人区”和“人圈”
    ——回忆日寇“集家并村”的血腥暴行
    陈迹
    一九四二年春天，侵华日寇开始“集家并村”。从古北口到山海关绵延七百余里的长城两侧，在南北五六十里、面积约四万二千平方里的地区，日寇迫使每个从小就生长在这里的中国人民，集中到日寇指定的地区居住。敌寇采取了“三光政策”，企图在这广大地区制造人类史上空前残暴的“无人区”，以便维持其法西斯统治。
    英勇的晋察冀边区人民，以坚决的斗争回答了敌人。与敌人“集家并村”同时，当地人民的反抗日寇的斗争也开始了。敌人在这个地区，每天进行着“扫荡”和搜索，在山沟里、山顶上，见人就杀，见房就烧，见牲口就牵走。被划在“无人区”的每个村庄，都受了敌人近十次的烧杀。冀东马尾沟只有四个小村，受了敌人十四次“扫荡”。马尾沟的人民是不屈服的，他们隐蔽在水沟里，土谷里，忍饥挨饿地和敌人周旋。敌人走了，他们就在被毁的废墟上，搭起茅屋；敌人又把茅屋焚毁；无畏的人民又把它搭起来，又被焚毁……。经过这样无数次的残酷斗争，马尾沟人民遂转移到山洞里，继续坚持斗争。敌人在每个山头都筑起碉堡，只要发见一个人影，就不停地开枪射击。马尾沟看不见“人影”了，但是马尾沟山洞里隐蔽着的人们仍然战斗着。敌人放出无数条警犬，到处搜寻人迹；敌人还阴险地暗藏起来，假装离开了马尾沟，等到人们走出山洞，就残暴地砍杀。山洞里的人们只好继续隐蔽着，他们不敢生烟火，不敢发出一点声响，母亲不让孩子离开奶头，有的孩子哭了，母亲怕敌人听见，只好含着眼泪，把孩子捏死，来保护洞内人们的安全。人们没有衣穿，几个人轮穿着一条裤子；没有粮食，只好偷偷地在洞外拾些野菜、野草和树叶充饥。有个妇女，背着孩子出洞寻找野菜，刚走出不远就被敌人捉去了。她被十五个敌人按在地上轮奸，孩子靠在她的身旁。敌人问她：“他们在那里？”她不回答。敌人用刀割掉她的左乳头，血淋淋的乳头落在孩子身上，孩子紧握着乳头，惊惧地哭喊着：“妈……”。敌人回手把孩子砍死。马尾沟七十户人家，被敌人杀死、打死、烧死和奸死了一大半。所谓“无人区”的中国人民就这样被敌人摧毁着。那时，可爱的祖国原野成了悲惨的人间地狱。
    被敌人赶进指定地区居住的人们成了牛羊。他们被关在一片片的警戒森严的地方，不能和外界接触，不能和近在咫尺的村庄来往，不能种十里以外的土地。居住在这里的人们都叫这块地方是：“人圈”。“人圈”里有着严密的敌特组织，他们制订了“思想犯”、“政治犯”、“通奸犯”、“运输犯”等血腥条例。凡是能拿枪的男人，都被编入“自卫团”，每晚替敌人巡查，不能睡眠。“自卫团”的人又是“勤劳奉公”队的队员，每个队员每月都要抽出十五天到二十天的时间，替敌人“勤劳奉公”：修炮楼、筑堡垒、铺火车道、修汽车路，有时还被派到东北去做苦工。劳役还没有做完，他们就已经累死了。敌人立下各种税收名目，来压榨“人圈”。“人圈”里的人民所有的收入都不够纳税，他们靠着敌人的配给过活，每年配给每人三尺布，半年配给九两面，两个月配给一斤半盐。此外，什么也没有了。每个人的脸都饿得发青，天天挖掘野菜、野草过活。
    “人圈”里的妇女，受着更多的摧残。她们每天要“跑人圈”：早晨起来，丢下孩子，集合在圈外，沿圈跑步；跑不快的，要挨打；不跑的，就算犯了罪。每个礼拜，还有一次“跑山”的“训练”。敌人把她们集中在山脚下，命令她们跑上山顶。等她们快到山顶时，敌人突然鸣枪，以惊恐妇女取笑。假如有的跑不上山顶，就算“思想犯”，被杀死。敌人奸污妇女，竟成了“公开合法”的事。脱避奸污的，拒绝奸污的，就是“通匪犯”，惨遭敌人的杀害。“人圈”里的人们永远记得敌人的“大检举”，敌人曾借此大批屠杀无辜人民。
    今天“无人区”人民正在医治着伤痕，他们还没有来得及清算这笔血债，却又听到了美帝国主义重新武装日本的消息，他们不可抑止的愤怒的火焰，将把美帝国主义的毒恶阴谋化成灰烬。（附图片）
