　　“Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship!”
　　By our reporter, Li Zhuang

　　“Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship!” This slogan, visible everywhere in the thoroughfares and back alleys, on city walls and in remote areas of Korea, is a new phenomenon that I felt keenly upon my second entry into Korea. It existed in the past, but it is even more prevalent now, leaving a very strong impression. This is not just an ordinary slogan, but a noble spirit, a pure hope, and a vivid reality. The peoples of China and Korea shake hands, laugh, and celebrate together everywhere in Korea. Fighting side by side to win victories is a grand celebration. Holding various symposiums, discussing experiences, and chatting about everyday life is a small celebration. The Chinese people, through their just volunteer actions, have received lofty respect in Korea, and as a member of the Chinese people, I have personally experienced this glory.

　　One, A Joyful New Year's Day

　　We spent New Year's Day of 1951 in Xinxingli, near Dingzhou, during our march. The Americans had once invaded Dingzhou, but were later driven out by our Chinese People's Volunteers. Many Korean village cadres in Xinxingli had been captured and imprisoned in Dingzhou prison. During the Second Campaign, they were liberated by our Chinese People's Volunteers. Therefore, their feelings for the Volunteers are twofold. First, China and Korea have both suffered from American aggression, and the Volunteers and the People's Army fight side by side, striking at a common enemy, and are close comrades-in-arms. Second, the Volunteers rescued them, adding another layer of friendship.

　　The weather was clear on New Year's Day, and the warm sunshine shone on the liberated land of Korea. We – a group of Chinese cultural workers – were invited to the office of the Village People's Committee to celebrate the victorious New Year's Day of 1951. Guests sat on the floor. Cheng Guiru, the Chairman of the Village People's Committee, wearing bleached Korean clothing, greeted his guests. The table was set with yellow rice wine and rice cakes brewed by Korean farmers.

　　The host gave a speech, concise and profound. "Today we are meeting to celebrate our victory and to thank the Volunteers for their assistance," he said humbly. "Therefore, we have prepared some simple wine to express our respect." The guests and hosts repeatedly toasted "The Friendship and Victory of the Chinese and Korean People!" Enemy planes constantly passing overhead seemed so insignificant at this moment that no one paid them any attention.

　　Later, in Seoul, a People's Army officer wrote to us in pencil: "Words cannot express the myriad of emotions." This is true. I have repeatedly experienced the profound meaning of this sentence. Before the symposium ended, the host brought four letters of appreciation, "Dedicated to the Chinese People's Volunteers Comrades." The Village People's Committee, the Village Branch of the Workers' Party, the Village Branch of the Farmers' Alliance, and the Village Branch of the Patriotic Anti-Enemy Support Association each presented a letter. The center of the letter paper was written with large brush strokes, such as "Defeat American Imperialism" and "Victory is Certain," in a format very similar to our banners of merit.

　　All the cadres of Xinxingli, on behalf of all the villagers, "Wish the Volunteer Comrades Victory and Health." The Chairmen of the Village Branches of the Democratic Party and the Green Friends Party also came to express their gratitude to the volunteer troops on behalf of all the party members in the village. They asked us to convey their sentiments to our people and the Volunteers, saying, "On New Year's Day of 1951, the Korean people extend their New Year's greetings to the Chinese people." We are willing to do so, willing to bring honor to the people of the motherland.

　　Two, An Evening Chat in Pyongyang

　　On the evening of the 10th, a symposium was held in the basement of the Propaganda Department of the Pyongyang People's Government, attended by Korean and Chinese cultural workers in Pyongyang. Kim Wu-sung, the Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, hosted the meeting. More than twenty people from both sides participated. Candles were lit on the table, and the room was filled with the smoke of damp firewood. The Americans destroyed Pyongyang, causing great difficulties, but Pyongyang continued to carry out its work.

　　In 1951, symposiums were held everywhere in Korea. Korean comrades wanted to understand China, and Chinese comrades wanted to understand Korea. The symposium was a good way to understand each other, and this desire for understanding is a manifestation of friendship.

　　Deputy Minister Kim Wu-sung detailed the situation of Korean cultural and artistic work during the war. He said that, like China, their cultural and artistic work also served the just war. After the war began, they organized more than 130 performing arts teams (cultural work troupes) to work on the front lines and in the rear; mobilized more than 40 writers to go to the front lines, live and fight with the soldiers, and wrote many articles, which were published in many newspapers and magazines under the title of "Warfront Library"; the film industry has completed documentary films such as "Accusation of American Imperialist Atrocities," "Just War," and "War Report." Before the enemy landed in Incheon, Korea had 30 kinds of newspapers and 31 kinds of magazines. When the People's Army implemented a strategic retreat, most newspapers and magazines temporarily suspended publication, and are now gradually resuming. The Workers' Party's organ newspaper, "Rodong Sinmun," has always insisted on publication.

　　Deputy Minister Kim thanked the Chinese people for their help to the Korean people, and hoped that Chinese cultural workers would provide more suggestions for Korean cultural work.

　　We sincerely admired the great fighting spirit of the Korean cultural workers in the Patriotic War, and we wanted to learn from them. Therefore, we also introduced the situation of China's anti-American and aid-Korea movement, hoping to get valuable criticisms and opinions. The Korean comrades listened and said, "Sosemida, Sosemida" (Very good, very good).

　　At the end of the symposium, everyone bid farewell, and made appointments: "See you in Busan, Jeju Island."

　　Three, A Celebration in Seoul

　　On the evening of the 21st, the Seoul City Party Committee of the Workers' Party held a reception to welcome Chinese cultural workers to Seoul. The heads of the Seoul City Party Committee, the People's Committee, the Democratic Women's General League, the Democratic Youth League, and the Seoul Liberation Daily all came. Li Taebing, the Deputy Organization Minister of the Seoul City Party Committee, who had just returned from guerrilla warfare in the distant Nakdong River, participated in this grand event with a face full of dust.

　　The venue was in a house that American planes could not find. The venue was decorated with the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin. The strong light of the carbide lamps shone on the faces of the happy people.

　　We can't remember all the kind words. Kim Dong-seon, the Secretary-General of the City People's Committee, said, "I hope you will convey Seoul's gratitude to the Chinese people to the Chinese people. Seoul has been victorious. The enemy has turned the victorious Seoul into a desolate desert, which we are very pained by. But with the help of the Soviet and Chinese peoples, we are determined to build a new Seoul, more beautiful and grand." Li Won-cho, the chief writer of the Liberation Daily, said, "The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is very long. But it has never been as close as it is today. In the past, we jointly resisted Japan, and today we jointly resist the United States. We must be victorious. All the Korean people unanimously thank the Chinese Volunteers and hope you will convey this voice to China." Hyun Ki-mu, the Chairman of the Women's League, said, "Korean women, past, present, and future, are doing their best to help the Chinese Volunteer Forces, cooking, boiling water, washing clothes... When we see the suffering Korean women, we think of the happy Chinese women. May the Chinese and Korean women always be friendly, and may Korean women be as happy as Chinese women in the near future." Go Kun, the Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Youth League, said, "I have had several pen talks with the young comrades in the Volunteers. We firmly believe that our struggle will be victorious. The Chinese youth cultivated by Chairman Mao and the Korean youth cultivated by Premier Kim Il-sung will always be invincible."

　　The Korean comrades' concern for China's anti-American and aid-Korea movement is simply indescribable. We were invited to introduce the situation of our people's anti-American and aid-Korea movement, and even though there were omissions, it aroused the strong interest of the Korean comrades. The activities of workers, farmers, troops, industrialists and businessmen, literary and artistic circles, news circles, and film circles were all mentioned. The Korean comrades listened and asked about the most meaningful details.

　　Four, Friendship is Born from Struggle

　　We know that achieving victory is not easy. Therefore, this friendship that guarantees victory is the most precious. We know that friendship is not only built at symposiums, but more importantly, it is born on the battlefield where we fight side by side. In the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, many Korean comrades participated in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, in the far rear of the enemy, eating chaff and vegetables together, shedding fresh blood, and finally planting our five-star red flag on the victorious Hainan Island. If our five-star red flag is dyed with the blood of martyrs, then we will never forget that there is the blood of Korean comrades among them. On the icy and snowy "38th Parallel," Korean farmers described to us the scene of our People's Volunteer Forces crossing the Imjin River. The Americans and puppet troops had built solid fortifications south of the Imjin River. According to the soldiers, the Imjin River was half ice and half water, making it the most difficult to wade through. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Volunteer soldiers, wearing cotton-padded clothes, braved enemy fire and jumped into the river, which was waist-deep. In ten minutes, they reached the other side of the river, and the cotton-padded trousers had turned into ice buckets. The soldiers continued to charge. The cotton-padded trousers broke at the knees, and the lower part was completely exposed. The soldiers continued to charge. The Volunteers achieved amazing victories under conditions far beyond what ordinary people could imagine, and were praised as "divine soldiers" by the elderly Korean farmers.

　　We saw several Korean People's Army soldiers on the streets of Seoul lifting a political instructor of the Chinese People's Volunteers into the air.

　　Anyone who thinks this friendship is easily obtained is wrong. We must not only defeat the enemy's destruction and atrocities, but also break the enemy's provocation and deception. General Li Quanwu, who participated in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Northeast China at the age of seventeen, said, "After the 'September 18th Incident,' the Japanese implemented a despicable policy in Northeast China: provoking Koreans to kill Chinese, and provoking Chinese to kill Koreans. However, under Japanese rule, the Chinese organized anti-Japanese guerrillas, and the Koreans also organized anti-Japanese guerrillas. Everyone was a close comrade-in-arms." The Americans are more vicious than the Japanese. They have destroyed the mountains and rivers of Korea and slaughtered the people of Korea, but they shamelessly propagate: "The Chinese army is very barbaric, gouging out eyes and cutting off breasts." However, the Koreans are very clear about the Volunteers' performance in Korea. Kim Tae-yeon, an old worker at No. 67 Cheonlandong (Street), Seodaemun District, Seoul, said, "The gunfire had just ended, and I heard someone knocking on the door, and I was very flustered. Two Volunteers came in. They spoke with their hands and gestures, and their faces were smiling. We smoked cigarettes together, as if the nephews who had left home had returned. They asked for directions with a pen, saluted, and left. With just that smile, you know they are well-educated people."

　　Our Volunteers are well-educated people, people with military, political, and cultural education. Therefore, we can win victories and establish brilliant achievements in Korea.

### “朝中亲善万岁！”

　　“朝中亲善万岁！”
    本报记者　李庄
    “朝中亲善万岁！”这幅遍布朝鲜通衢陋巷、城头僻壤的标语，是我第二次进入朝鲜后，首先感触到的一种新东西。它过去就有，现在更多，给人的印象十分强烈。这不是一张普通的标语，而是一种崇高的精神，纯正的希望，活生生的现实。中朝两国人民在朝鲜到处握手，到处谈笑，到处联欢。并肩一起打胜仗，这是大联欢。召开各种座谈会，谈经验、话家常，这是小联欢。中国人民以自己的正义的志愿行动，在朝鲜受到了崇高的敬重，作为中国人民的一分子，我也亲身体会到了这一种光荣。
            一、愉快的元旦
    我们在行军途中，在定州附近的新兴里，度过一九五一年的元旦。美国人一度侵入定州，后来，被我国人民志愿军打跑了。新兴里许多朝鲜村干部曾被俘，关到定州监狱里，在第二次战役期间，他们被我国人民志愿军所解放。因此，他们对志愿军的情谊是双重的。第一、中朝两国同受美国侵略，志愿军和人民军并肩作战，系打击共同的敌人，彼此是密切的战友。第二、志愿军拯救了他们，又多一层友情。
    元旦天气晴明，温暖的阳光普照着解放后的朝鲜大地。我们——一群中国的文化工作者被邀请到里人民委员会的办公室中，迎接胜利的一九五一年元旦。宾主席地而坐。里人民委员长承龟汝穿着漂白的朝鲜服装，招待他的客人。桌子上摆着朝鲜农民自酿的黄酒和年糕。
    主人致词，词简意深。“今天开会，庆祝我们的胜利，感谢志愿军的援助，”他谦逊地说：“所以聊备薄酒，表示敬意。”宾主一再为“中朝人民的友谊与胜利干杯！”不断掠空而过的敌机，此时显得这样渺小，大家都没有去看他。
    以后在汉城，一个人民军军官用铅笔对我们写道：“言语不通，情感万千。”这是真的。我几次三番地体会到这句话的深意。座谈会结束之前，主人拿来四封慰问信，“献给中国人民志愿军同志们”。里人民委员会、劳动党里支部、农民同盟里支部、祖国抗敌后援会里分会各送一封。信纸中央写着“打败美帝”、“胜利必成”等毛笔大字，其形式很像我国的锦旗。
    新兴里全体干部，代表全村人民，“祝志愿军同志们胜利和健康”。民主党、青友党里支部委员长也赶了来，代表该党全村党员，感谢志愿部队。他们请我们把这番心意告诉我国人民和志愿军，就说：“在一九五一年元旦，朝鲜人民给中国人民贺岁。”我们愿意这样作，愿意把荣誉带给祖国的人民。
            二、平壤一夕谈
    十日夜间，在平壤人民政府宣传省的地下室中，举行了一个朝中在平（壤）文化工作者座谈会。宣传省金午星副相作主人。双方共有二十余人参加。桌子上点着蜡烛，屋子里飘着湿柴的烟气。美国人破坏了平壤，给平壤造成巨大的困难，但是，平壤继续进行着自己的工作。
    一九五一年，朝鲜到处举行座谈会。朝鲜同志想了解中国，中国同志想了解朝鲜，座谈会是互相了解的好形式，这种了解的要求，就是友谊的表现。
    金午星副相详细介绍了战争期间朝鲜文化艺术工作的状况。他说，和中国一样，他们的文化艺术工作也是为正义战争服务的。战争开始后，他们组织了一百三十多个演艺队（文工团）到前线和后方工作；动员了四十多名作家到前方，和战士一起生活、战斗，写了许多文章，以“战线文库”为题，发表在许多报纸、刊物上；电影界已经完成《控诉美帝暴行》、《正义战争》、《战报》等纪录影片。敌人在仁川登陆前，朝鲜共有三十种报纸，三十一种刊物。人民军实行战略撤退时，大部分报纸、杂志暂时停刊，现正陆续恢复。劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》，则是始终坚持出版的。
    金副相感谢中国人民对于朝鲜人民的帮助，希望中国文化工作者对朝鲜的文化工作多多提供意见。
    我们衷心赞佩朝鲜文化工作者在卫国战争中的伟大的战斗精神，我们要向他们学习。因此，我们也把我国文化界抗美援朝的情况介绍了一番，希望得到宝贵的批评和意见。朝鲜同志边听边说：“梭斯米达，梭斯米达”（很好，很好）。
    座谈会结束，大家珍重道别，互相约会：“在釜山、济州岛见面”。
            三、汉城交欢
    二十一日夜间，劳动党汉城市党部举行招待会，欢迎到汉城的中国文化工作者。汉城市党部、人民委员会、民主妇女总同盟、民主青年同盟、汉城解放日报的负责人都来了。刚从遥远的洛东江打游击回来的汉城市党部副组织部长李泰炳，带着满面风尘，参加这一盛会。
    会场设在一个美国飞机找不到的房子里。会场中挂着朝、中、苏国旗和金日成首相、毛泽东主席、斯大林大元帅的画像。电石灯的强光照在愉快的人们的脸上。
    亲切的语言，让我们记不胜记。市人民委员会秘书长金东璇说：“希望诸位把汉城对中国人民的感谢，传给中国人民。汉城胜利了。敌人把胜利的汉城变成荒凉的沙漠，我们非常痛心。但在苏联人民与中国人民帮助之下，我们有决心建设一个新汉城，更美丽，更宏大。”解放日报主笔李源朝说：“中朝人民友谊甚长。但像今天这样亲密，却是过去所没有的。过去我们共同抗日，今天我们共同抗美，我们一定要胜利。全朝鲜人民一致感谢中国志愿军，希望诸位把这种声音传到中国去。”女盟委员长玄其武说：“朝鲜妇女过去、现在和将来，都是尽自己一切力量，帮助中国志愿部队的，作饭、烧水、洗衣服……我们看到苦难的朝鲜妇女，就想起幸福的中国妇女，愿中朝妇女永远亲善，愿在不久的将来，朝鲜妇女和中国妇女一样的幸福。”民青副委员长高昆说：“我和志愿军中的青年同志作过几次笔谈，我们坚信我们的斗争一定胜利。毛主席培养的中国青年和金日成首相培养的朝鲜青年，永远是不可被战胜的。”
    朝鲜同志对我国抗美援朝运动的关心，简直无法形容。我们被邀请介绍我国人民抗美援朝的情况，即使挂一漏万，也引起朝鲜同志浓厚的兴趣。工人的、农民的、部队的、工商界的、文艺界的、新闻界的、电影界的活动，都谈到了一些。朝鲜同志一面听着，一面追问其中最有意义的细节。
            四、友谊是从斗争中产生的
    我们知道：取得胜利并不容易。因此，这种保证胜利的友谊就是最应珍贵的。我们知道：友谊不只建筑在座谈会上，更重要的是产生于并肩作战的战场上。在抗日战争的艰苦岁月里，多少朝鲜同志参加了八路军和新四军，在敌人深远的后方，一起吃糠咽菜、流鲜血，最后把我国的五星红旗，插到胜利的海南岛上。如果说我国的五星红旗是用烈士的鲜血染成的，那么，我们永远不会忘记其中有朝鲜同志的鲜血。在冰天雪地的“三八线”上，朝鲜农民曾向我们描述我国人民志愿部队强渡临津江的情景。美国人和伪军在临津江南设有坚固工事，临津江半冰半水，据战士们说：这是最难涉渡的。志愿军的战士在炮火掩护下，穿着棉衣，冒着敌火，跳入水深及腹的江中。十分钟打到江的对岸，棉裤已变成冰桶子。战士们继续冲锋。棉裤在膝盖部分折断了，下部完全裸露出来。战士们继续冲锋。志愿军在远非常人所能想像的困难条件下取得惊人的胜利，被上年纪的朝鲜农民誉为“神兵”。
    我们看见，在汉城街头，几个朝鲜人民军战士把中国人民志愿军一个指导员举在空中。
    谁要以为这种友谊是轻易得来的，那就错了。我们不只要战败敌人的摧毁和虐杀，还要打破敌人的挑拨和欺骗。十七岁就在我国东北参加抗日游击战争的李权武将军说：“九一八”事变后，日本人在东北实行一种可恶的政策：挑拨朝鲜人杀中国人，又挑拨中国人杀朝鲜人。但是，在日本人统治下，中国人组织了抗日游击队，朝鲜人也组织了抗日游击队，大家都是亲密的战友。美国人比日本人更狠毒，他们破坏了朝鲜的河山，杀戮了朝鲜的人民，却厚颜无耻地宣传：“中国军队十分野蛮，挖眼睛割奶子。”但是，志愿军在朝鲜的表现，朝鲜人是很清楚的。汉城西大门区天蓝洞（街）六十七号老工人金太炎说：“枪声刚刚结束，我听到有人叫门，心里很慌张。进来两个志愿军。他们用手和姿式讲话，脸是微笑的。我们在一起抽烟，好像离家的侄子回来了。他们用笔问了问路，行了个礼，走了。就凭那么一笑，你就知道他们是有教养的人。”
    我们的志愿军是有教养的人，是有军事的、政治的、文化的教养的人。因此，我们才能赢得胜利。才能在朝鲜建立光辉的业绩。
