Drawing the National Flag Should Strictly Adhere to Regulations
    Editor:
    The method for drawing the national flag, the size of the five stars, and their distances, have been clearly stipulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. However, I have found that some people drawing the national flag do not follow the regulations. Last spring, the certificates of merit issued by the Linzi Cultural and Entertainment Committee, the certificates of merit issued by the Linzi County government to the river-digging workers last autumn, and the graduation certificates of many schools in Shandong, etc., all had the national flag drawn incorrectly. The large star was drawn too small, the small stars were drawn too large, and the distances were either too close or too far. Recently, in the propaganda paintings printed by the Preparatory Committee of the East China General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Imperialist Aggression, such as "The Sino-Soviet Alliance is Invincible Under Heaven" and "Raise Vigilance, Defend the Motherland, and Do Not Let American Imperialism Occupy One Inch of Our Land," the national flags also committed the above-mentioned errors. This is a very unserious style, and it is hoped that those who draw the national flag will pay attention.

　　绘制国旗应严守规定
    编辑同志：
    国旗的绘制办法，五个星的大小及距离，中国人民政治协商会议已做了明确的规定。但是，我发现有些绘制国旗的人却不按规定办事。去年春临淄文化娱乐委员会颁发的奖状，临淄县政府去年秋发给挖河民工的奖状及山东不少学校的毕业证书等，都把国旗画错了，大星画小了，小星画大了，距离也有过近过远的现象。最近中国人民保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略委员会华东总分会筹委会印制的宣传画中，如“中苏同盟无敌于天下”及“提高警惕，保卫祖国，不让美帝占我一寸土地”两画内的国旗，也都犯了上述的错误。这是很不严肃的作风，希望绘制国旗的人能够注意。
