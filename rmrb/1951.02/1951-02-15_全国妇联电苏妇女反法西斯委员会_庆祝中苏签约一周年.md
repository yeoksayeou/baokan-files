　　The All-China Women's Federation Cables the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee
　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram to the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee to celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The telegram is as follows:

Chairman Popkova:

　　On the occasion of the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union, please accept our sincere greetings. This treaty has made a great contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. At a time when American imperialism is attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, vainly trying to rearm Japan and expand its war of aggression, its significance is even greater. We are convinced that the close unity between the people and women of China and the Soviet Union is the decisive force for consolidating the victory of the world peace and democracy camp and defeating the aggression of American imperialism.

　　全国妇联电苏妇女反法西斯委员会
　  庆祝中苏签约一周年
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订周年纪念，特致电苏联妇女反法西斯委员会。电文如下：波波娃主席：
    兹值中苏友好同盟互助条约签订周年纪念，特电致意。这一条约对保卫远东和世界和平作了伟大的贡献。正当美帝国主义企图单独对日媾和、妄想重新武装日本、扩大侵略战争的时候，其意义更为重大。我们深信中苏两国人民与妇女的亲密团结，是巩固世界和平民主阵营的胜利和击败美帝国主义侵略的决定力量。
                                    中华全国民主妇女联合会
                                                二月十三日
