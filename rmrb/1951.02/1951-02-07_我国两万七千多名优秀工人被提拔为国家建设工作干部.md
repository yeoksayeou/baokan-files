Xinhua News Agency, 5th—In the new China, a large number of outstanding workers have become important cadres in national construction. According to statistics from Northeast China, North China, Shandong and other places alone, a total of 10,646 workers have been promoted to work in trade unions, government organs, and other organizations at all levels, and 17,107 have been promoted to cadres in various technical and management departments. The railway system alone promoted 2,386 people to cadres last year. In the Northeast, from the complete liberation to the end of last year, 441 workers have been promoted to factory directors, 484 to section chiefs, and 2,247 to technicians. Many old workers from the "February 7th" strike have been promoted to leading cadres at all levels. For example, Liang Yongfu, the director of the Yangquan branch of the Zhengtai Railway Trade Union during the "February 7th" strike, has been elected as an alternate member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and is the chairman of the Taiyuan District Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union. Su Guangfu, a well-known labor model among railway workers in the Zhengzhou area, has been elected as a member of the city's People's Government and is the deputy director of the city's Labor Bureau. After liberation, some outstanding workers who emerged in production labor have also been promoted. For example, Zhao Guoyou, a national model worker and lathe operator from the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant, and Li Yong, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the banner of national locomotives, have been appointed as the deputy director of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the vice chairman of the National Railway Trade Union, respectively.

　　The promotion of a large number of outstanding workers to cadres has greatly encouraged the working masses. They have become more aware that the working class is truly the master of the country, and they also feel that the responsibility of being the master of their own affairs is great, so they work even harder. For example, after workers Liu Yingyuan and Wang Wenbin became the director and deputy director of the Shijingshan Power Plant, the power generation has reached the highest record since the plant was built, and accidents were basically eliminated in the middle of last year.

　　In addition to training workers as cadres in their work, the state and trade unions have also established many schools for them to improve their political, cultural, and technical levels. For example, advanced workers and revolutionary cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds account for more than half of the more than 3,000 students at the Renmin University of China. Last winter, the National Advanced Industrial School specially added four worker classes. At present, there are 24 worker-peasant quick literacy middle schools in various places, of which industrial workers account for more than a quarter. There are 52 trade union cadre schools and various professional training courses organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and local trade unions, with more than 41,000 students. More than 700,000 workers across the country are participating in worker spare-time schools.

　　我国两万七千多名优秀工人被提拔为国家建设工作干部
    【新华社五日讯】在人民新中国大批优秀工人已成为国家建设工作中的重要干部。仅据东北、华北、山东等地统计，工人被提拔到各级工会、政权机关和其他机关工作的共有一万零六百四十六人，被提拔为各种技术和管理部门干部的有一万七千一百零七人。铁路系统在去年一年中就提拔了二千三百八十六人作干部。东北自全部解放到去年年底为止，工人被提拔当厂长的已有四百四十一人，当科长的有四百八十四人，当技师的有二千二百四十七人。不少“二七”时的老工人已被提拔为各级领导干部。如“二七”时正太铁路总工会阳泉分会的主任梁永福已被选为全国总工会候补委员，并任中国铁路工会太原区委员会的主席。郑州区铁路工人中的著名劳动模范苏广福，已被选为该市人民政府委员，并任该市劳动局副局长。解放后，在生产劳动中涌现的优秀工人也有一部分被提拔起来。如全国著名劳动模范、沈阳机器三厂车工赵国有、全国机车的旗帜“毛泽东号”司机长李永，已分任全国总工会生产部副部长和全国铁路工会副主席。
    大批优秀工人的被提升为干部，使工人群众受到了很大的鼓励。他们更加体会到工人阶级真正是国家的主人翁，也感觉到当家作主人的责任重大，因而更加努力工作。如石景山发电厂由工人刘英源和王文斌当了正副厂长以后，发电量已达到建厂以来的最高纪录，并在去年中基本上消灭了事故。
    除了在工作中培养工人作干部以外，国家和工会还特别为他们办了许多学校，来提高他们的政治、文化和技术水平，如中国人民大学三千多学员中先进工人和工农出身的革命干部就占一半以上。去冬国立高级工业学校特别增设了四个工人班。目前各地工农速成中学已有二十四所，其中产业工人占四分之一以上。全国总工会和各地工会举办的工会干部学校和各种专业训练班有五十二个，学员四万一千多人。全国各地参加工人业余学校学习的工人达七十万以上。
