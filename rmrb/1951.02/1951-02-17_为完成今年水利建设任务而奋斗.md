　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government approved the report of the Ministry of Water Conservancy on the Summary of Water Conservancy Work in 1950 and the Guidelines and Tasks for 1951 on January 12th. This report affirmed the achievements of national water conservancy work in 1950, and pointed out the shortcomings, errors, and major experiences and lessons learned in the work. In 1951, with the continued aggression of US imperialism against Taiwan and Korea, consolidating national defense became the primary task of the country. However, because water conservancy construction is a career closely related to the restoration and development of agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives, the Central People's Government still decided to allocate more funds than in 1950 for water conservancy. The total amount of water conservancy funds in 1950 exceeded the highest annual total water conservancy investment during the Kuomintang reactionary rule by many times, and the investment in water conservancy in 1951 increased by 80% compared with the investment in 1950. When imperialist countries are preparing for wars of aggression, forcing their people to tighten their belts and using cannons instead of butter, our government is investing such huge forces in the construction of people's water conservancy. This vividly illustrates the different nature of the people's own government and the reactionary governments of imperialist countries!
    According to the report of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the water conservancy work in 1950 completed huge projects, established the preliminary foundation for national water conservancy construction, and reduced last year's floods. This achievement is very significant. However, there are also some shortcomings that must and can be overcome. Among them, the main problems are insufficient investigation and research, and insufficient planning, which have caused serious losses and waste in the project. In order to effectively use the huge amount of water conservancy construction funds in 1951 and ensure the completion of the water conservancy construction tasks, the leading organs in relevant areas and water conservancy organs at all levels must address these shortcomings and earnestly study methods for improvement.
    The first issue to be paid attention to in this year's water conservancy projects is to strengthen investigation and research, and planning and design work. The method is mainly to effectively implement the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government that engineering and financial plans will not be reported, and construction funds will not be allocated without the approval of a certain higher level, in order to overcome blindness in the project. As mentioned above, losses and waste were the main shortcomings in water conservancy work in 1950, and the biggest reason for causing losses and waste was insufficient investigation and research, rough plans, and immature preparation work. If the planning of water conservancy projects is improper, the expected effect will not occur. If the plan is rough and the plan is changed temporarily, or even if it can be completed, it is very uneconomical, which will inevitably cause great waste. Therefore, water conservancy leading organs at all levels must first grasp the most important link of engineering design. In order to overcome blindness in the work, water conservancy organs in various places must, for the management of each river, focus on the characteristics of each river, and first have a longer-term overall plan for the main problems related to benefiting and eliminating harm in the upper and lower reaches and in the tributaries. Then select key points and implement construction in stages and steps. In this way, starting from the overall situation and working systematically and step by step, we can distinguish the priorities and move forward steadily to gradually solve all the problems. As for the specific implementation of the project, we must first do a good job in surveying and measuring work, and make a comprehensive, objective and calm analysis and comparison based on the engineering effect, service life, and engineering cost expenditure. If necessary, several comparison plans can be formulated to study and determine the most economical and effective plan. At the same time, full estimates should also be made for cadre allocation, mobilization of civilian labor, and supply of materials and machinery to ensure the smooth progress of the project. When carrying out engineering design, on the one hand, we must oppose the tendency to exaggerate economic benefits and ignore difficult conditions. At the same time, we must also oppose the delaying tactic of not conducting investigation and research, but only shouting that there is insufficient data. In the initial stage of implementing this strict planning and design system, some areas may feel difficulty for a while because they are not familiar with this detailed and precise work system. Leading organs at all levels must organize forces to conduct specific inspections and assistance. The departments in charge of planning and design of higher-level leading organs must also regularly dispatch personnel to systematically understand the water conservancy situation and difficult problems in various regions, and guide the work based on the results of on-site inspections. Water conservancy leading organs should resolutely prevent leadership methods that are divorced from reality and are purely formalistic on paper, because this leadership method can easily cause danger to water conservancy projects.
    After the project plan is established, correct organization and leadership is the second basic link in water conservancy projects. Under the current conditions, most of our water conservancy projects are mass projects. Mobilizing and organizing millions of people to participate in water conservancy projects is the most arduous and complex task, and it is also an important key to the success or failure of the project and whether there are losses and waste. To do this work well, according to the situation in 1950, there are the following important experiences: (1) Regarding the mobilization and leadership of civilian workers. Most areas of the country rely on local administrative cadres, so the unification of the leading thinking of the water conservancy organs and the local administrative organs during the construction is the primary condition for the smooth completion of the task. Therefore, before the start of the project, water conservancy organs at all levels must hold various meetings systematically from top to bottom with the relevant administrative organs to fully exchange views on specific issues such as the project plan, project benefits, the requirements for the mobilization of civilian workers, and wage treatment, and reach a consensus. It is necessary to prevent the occurrence of various deviations from the beginning of the mobilization of civilian workers. (2) Before construction starts, it is necessary to do a good job in various preparations related to the project, such as setting lines and engineering standards, cadre allocation, food and accommodation for civilian workers, site layout, and tool allocation. All these preparations must be inspected on-site. (3) Regarding the organization of civilian workers. According to the size of the labor force, under the administrative leadership, free combination, and at the same time strictly implementing the method of paying wages according to the amount of work completed, is the best organizational method to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of civilian workers and improve work efficiency. At the same time, there should be an appropriate ratio between civilian workers and cadres who lead them to ensure the smooth progress of the work. It is necessary to study and stipulate precise and simple procedures for matters such as checking the amount of work and issuing grain to reduce miscellaneous work. These are all issues that must be paid attention to. (4) Equal emphasis on quality and efficiency is the guiding principle that administrative cadres and technical cadres must jointly grasp, and it is necessary to arouse the conscious efforts of civilian workers through propaganda and education. After the lives and emotions of the civilian workers are generally stable, various competitions can be appropriately launched to stimulate labor enthusiasm, but it is necessary to take care of the health of the civilian workers. The direction of the competition should focus on improving the collective work efficiency, and should focus on improving work methods and tools to generally improve work efficiency and prevent the tendency of individual desperate efforts. (5) Before construction, ideological education for administrative and technical cadres, transmission and learning of methods for checking the amount of work and issuing grain; after construction starts, education for civilian workers, promotion of the spirit of democratic management, and protection of the health of civilian workers should all be regarded as important work.
    In order to effectively organize and lead, correctly determining the wage system for civilian workers is a major key. In the water conservancy projects in 1950, the wages of civilian workers implemented in various places were inconsistent in terms of both high and low levels and methods. Some adopted piece-rate wages, and some still followed the old conscription method and adopted daily wages. Even in terms of daily wages, the systems used and calculation methods were not unified. As a result, there was an unequal phenomenon in the same area, which greatly affected the emotions of the civilian workers. For this issue, there are two basic viewpoints that must be clarified. First, the civilian workers used in water conservancy projects generally have the nature of semi-voluntary labor. Because the purpose of water conservancy projects is generally to directly protect the people's own fields and houses, or to directly increase the income of agricultural products. Therefore, water conservancy projects have always been undertakings that are either run by the people or jointly run by the government and the people. At present, the civilian workers mobilized to participate in water conservancy projects in various places, regardless of what method is adopted, also have the nature of semi-voluntary labor, which is different from general wages. The second point is that from the perspective of stimulating the emotions of civilian workers and improving work efficiency, all those who follow the old conscription system and adopt the method of issuing grain on a daily basis generally do not perform well, while those who adopt the piece-rate wage method and pay according to the amount of work completed, regardless of the price per unit, have improved efficiency. However, in some areas, some deviations have occurred because the calculation of the price per unit is not appropriate, and the differences in soil quality and the difficulty of the project have not been appropriately distinguished. Based on these important experiences, the report of the Ministry of Water Conservancy approved by the Government Administration Council proposes a civilian worker wage system that combines voluntary labor and piece-rate payment, requiring consistent implementation across the country. According to this system, on the one hand, it still has the nature of semi-voluntary labor, and the wages are lower, but it can ensure that as long as a civilian worker does the normal amount of work, it is enough to eat and can compensate for the wear and tear of clothing and tools. On the other hand, the piece-rate wage method is still adopted, and more work leads to more pay, in order to improve work efficiency. This method can not only save a portion of the construction costs, but also allow for more projects to be done outside of key projects to appropriately take care of the urgent needs of the people in various places, and at the same time protect the lives of civilian workers, so that there is no deficit or not enough to eat. According to the results of the recent winter repair project in northern Anhui, because the efficiency reached an average of two cubic meters per person per day, most civilian workers can also get some surplus grain. However, when implementing the above decision, all localities must strengthen propaganda and education on the mobilization of civilian workers, absolutely avoid coercion and orders, and must prevent phenomena such as increased apportionments due to lower wages. At the same time, it is necessary to effectively improve the leadership of civilian workers and reduce various miscellaneous tasks and unwarranted waste to protect the legitimate interests of civilian workers.
    At present, agricultural production still accounts for the largest proportion in the entire system of our national construction. Carrying out water conservancy work and preventing possible floods is one of the main guarantees for increasing agricultural production at present. Now the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has approved the water conservancy work plan proposed by the Ministry of Water Conservancy, and all projects will be launched one after another after February this year. It is hoped that the staff of the governments, parties, and people's organizations in the relevant areas will mobilize and strive to complete this huge task.

### 为完成今年水利建设任务而奋斗

　　为完成今年水利建设任务而奋斗
    一月十二日政务院政务会议，批准了中央人民政府水利部关于一九五○年水利工作总结和一九五一年的方针与任务的报告。这个报告肯定了一九五○年全国水利工作的成绩，并指出在工作中所曾发生的缺点、错误，和主要的经验教训。一九五一年在美帝继续侵略台湾、朝鲜的情况下，巩固国防成为国家当前首要的任务，可是因为水利建设是和恢复发展农业生产与改善人民生活密切相关的事业，中央人民政府仍然决定拨出比一九五○年更大的经费，用于水利事业。一九五○年水利事业费的总额，超过国民党反动统治时期最高年度的水利投资总额许多倍，一九五一年水利事业的投资又比一九五○年投资增加百分之八十。在帝国主义国家为了准备侵略战争，强迫它的人民束紧裤带，用大炮代牛油的时候，我们的政府却用这样巨大的力量，投资于人民水利的建设事业，这鲜明地说明了，人民自己的政府，和帝国主义国家的反动政府，具有何等不同的性质！
    根据水利部的报告，一九五○年的水利工作，完成了巨大的工程，建立了全国水利建设的初步基础，并减轻了去年的水灾，这个成绩是很大的。但是其中也存在一些必须而且能够加以克服的缺点。其中，主要是调查研究不足，计划性不足，因而造成工程上严重的损失和浪费的现象。为了有效地运用一九五一年这样巨量的水利建设经费，保证完成水利建设的任务，有关地区的领导机关和各级水利机关，必须针对这些缺点，切实研究改进的方法。
    今年水利工程上首先应注意的问题，是加强调查研究和规划设计工作。其方法，主要是切实执行中央人民政府政务院不报工程和财务计划，不经一定上级批准不拨工款的决定，以克服工程上的盲目性。如上所述，损失浪费曾经是一九五○年水利工作中主要的缺点，而造成损失浪费的最大的原因，又在于调查研究不足，计划粗略，准备工作不够成熟等。水利工程如果规划失当，即不能发生预期的效用，如果计划粗略，临时改变计划。或者虽能完工，但甚不经济，这必然造成很大浪费。所以各级水利领导机关，必须首先掌握工程设计这个最重要的环节。为了克服工作中的盲目性，各地水利机关对于各个河流的治理，都必须针对各个河流的特性，对上下游和本支流中有关兴利除害的主要问题，先有个较长远的通盘规划，然后选择重点，有步骤地分期施工，这样从全局着眼，有系统有步骤地工作，我们才能分别轻重缓急，稳步前进，以逐渐解决全部的问题。至于具体工程的进行，又要首先做好查勘测量工作，根据工程效用，使用年限，和工费支出，做出全面的客观的冷静的分析比较，必要时并可订立几个比较计划，以研究确定最经济而有效的计划。同时对于干部配备，民力动员，和材料机械的供给等计划，也要充分估计，以保证工程的顺利进行。在进行工程设计时，一方面要反对夸大经济效益，忽视困难条件的偏向，同时也要反对那种不进行调查研究，却空喊资料不足的拖延等待的作风。在施行这个严格的规划设计制度的初期，可能有部分地区，由于不熟悉这种细密精确的工作制度，因而一时感觉困难，各级领导机关必须组织力量进行具体的检查与帮助。高级领导机关主持规划设计的部门，并须经常派遣人员，有系统地了解各地区水利情况和困难问题，多根据实地考察所得来指导工作，水利领导机关应坚决防止脱离实际的纸面的形式主义的领导方法，因为这种领导方法很容易使水利工程发生危险。
    工程计划确立之后，正确地进行组织领导就是水利工程中第二个基本环节。在目前的条件下，我们的水利工程，多数还是群众性的工程，动员和组织千百万群众参加水利工程是最艰巨而复杂的任务，也是工程成败和有无损失浪费的一个重要关键。要做好这一工作，根据一九五○年的情况，有下面几条重要的经验：（一）关于民工的动员和领导。全国多数地区是依靠当地地方行政干部的，所以在施工当中水利机关与当地地方行政机关的领导思想的统一，是顺利完成任务的首要的条件。因此，在工程开始之前，各级水利机关必须和有关的行政机关，自上而下地，系统地开好各种会议，把工程计划，工程效益，民工动员的要求和工资待遇等具体问题，充分交换意见，并取得一致。必须从民工动员开始便要防止各种偏向的发生。（二）开工以前，必须做好各项有关工程的准备工作，如定线和工程标准，干部配备，民工食宿，工地布置和工具配备等。所有这一些准备，均必须进行现地检查。（三）关于民工的组织。依照劳力大小，在行政领导之下，自由组合，同时严格执行按方给资的办法，是激发民工劳动热情，提高工作效率最好的组织方式。同时，民工与领导民工的干部，要有适当的比例，以保证工作的顺利推动。对于收方发粮等事务，要研究规定精确而简便的手续，以减少杂工，这都是必须注意的问题。（四）质量与效率并重，是行政干部与技术干部必须共同掌握的方针，并且要通过宣传教育，唤起民工自觉的努力。在民工生活情绪大体安定之后，可以适当发动各项竞赛，以激发劳动热忱，但是必须照顾民工的健康。竞赛的方向，应该着重于提高集体的工作效率，应该着重于改良工作方法和工具，以普遍提高工作效率，防止个人的拚命主义的偏向。（五）施工以前行政与技术干部的思想教育，收方发粮方法的传习；开工以后，对民工的教育，民主管理精神的发扬，以及对于民工健康的保护等，都应视为重要工作。
    为了有效地进行组织领导，正确地确定民工工资制度，是一个主要关键。一九五○年水利工程中，各地所实行的民工工资，高低既不一致，方法也不相同。有的采取计件工资，有的仍然沿袭征工的办法，采取计日工资。即以日工而论，所用的制度和计算的方法亦不统一。结果同一地区便有苦乐不均的现象，这就很影响民工的情绪。对于这一个问题，有两个基本观点必须要弄清楚。第一，水利工程所用民工，大体带半义务劳动的性质。因为水利工程的目的，大抵是直接保护人民自己的田园庐舍，或直接增加农产的收益。所以历来水利工程多系民办或民办公助的事业。目前我们各地水利事业动员参加的民工，无论采取什么方式，亦都带有半义务劳动的性质，与一般的工资不同。第二点，就激发民工情绪，提高工作效率方面来看，凡属沿袭旧日征工制度的习惯，采取计日发粮的，成绩大都不好，而采取计件工资方式，按方给资的，无论方价高低，效率均有提高。不过有部分地区，因为对于方价的计算不恰当，没有适当分别土质的不同和工程的难易，因而发生一些偏差。根据这些重要的经验，政务院所批准的水利部的报告，提出一种结合义务劳动与计件给值的民工工资制度，要求全国一致施行。依照这个制度，一方面仍然带有半义务劳动的性质，工资较低，可是却能保证一个民工只要做到普通的工作数量，即可够吃，并可补偿衣服工具的损耗。另一面，仍然采取计件工资的方式，多做多得，以便提高工作的效率。这个办法，不但可以节省一部分工款，可在重点工程以外，多做一些工程，以适当照顾各地人民迫切的需要，同时亦可保障民工生活，不至发生亏累或不够吃的事情。据最近皖北冬修工程试行的结果，因为效率达到平均每人每日两公方，多数民工并可得到一部分余粮。不过在执行上述决定时，各地对民工动员，必须加强宣传教育，绝对避免强迫命令，并且必须防止因为工资较低因而增加摊派等等的现象，同时要切实改善民工领导，减少各种杂工和不应有的浪费，以保障民工应得的利益。
    目前农业生产在我们国家建设的整个系统中，还占着最大的比重。进行水利工作，防止可能发生的水灾，又是目前农产增收的主要保证之一。现在中央人民政府政务院已经批准水利部所提的水利工作计划，全部工程在今年二月以后，即将陆续展开。希望有关各地的政府、党和人民团体的工作人员动员起来，为完成这个巨大的任务而奋斗。
