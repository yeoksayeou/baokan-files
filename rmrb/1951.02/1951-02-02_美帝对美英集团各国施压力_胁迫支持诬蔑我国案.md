　　US Imperialism Pressures Its Allies in the US-British Bloc
    Coercing Support for Slandering China

    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] Since January 22nd, in order to get the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to pass its slanderous proposal accusing our country of aggression, US imperialism has ferociously exerted pressure on many countries, coercing them to support the US proposal in an attempt to cover up the increasingly obvious divisions within the imperialist camp.

    Immediately following the failure of the US to coerce the Political Committee into quickly passing this slanderous proposal (the Associated Press called it "the most miserable failure in the five-year history of the United Nations"), the newspapers of the US monopoly capitalists immediately launched into a barrage of curses and threats against countries such as Britain, France, and India. The Washington Daily Post said on the 24th: "It is a disgrace to the United States that the US proposal was delayed by the votes of Britain, France, Canada, India, and the Asian bloc." The newspaper angrily cursed: "These countries, which consider themselves our friends, are all ungrateful people. Britain's vote against... shows that Anglo-American friendship is difficult to recognize." The Washington Post rebuked Britain on the 25th for "making a serious mistake" and threatened: "The growing gap between the United States and Britain regarding the appropriate policy for dealing with Communist China is bound to cause serious rethinking on both sides of the Atlantic." The New York Daily Mirror on the 25th even burst into abuse: "We cannot allow the cunning, scheming, and smooth-talking British to manipulate us and completely isolate us." The newspaper shamelessly threatened the US with withdrawing from the United Nations, saying: The United States should withdraw from "this hellish platform of the United Nations. We cannot allow Indians and Arabs to dominate us. We do not want the honor and dignity of our country to be gambled away by some recently emerging cowardly countries who want to gain a little power." The largest US broadcasting company, Columbia Broadcasting Corporation's foreign affairs reporter—Wall Street's mouthpiece, Sevareid, said in a broadcast on the 29th: "We must have reached an absurd stage. A company of soldiers has sat down, thinking that this war is a battle between their battalion commander and the enemy, and they should persuade both sides to abandon the idea of fighting."

    The US Congress also made a great fanfare, exercising pressure. Following the House of Representatives' passage on January 19 of a resolution demanding "swift action" by the United Nations on the US proposal, the Senate also passed a resolution on the 23rd to have the United Nations slander our country as an "aggressor" and declared that it would obstruct our country's entry into the United Nations. Even the Associated Press had to admit that "many people see the actions of Congress as outrageous and consider it an open exertion of pressure on international organizations." Then, US President Truman personally stepped forward on the 24th and issued a statement at a press conference, declaring that the US government "firmly supports" Austin's proposal in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee, threatening all countries that "they must make their own decisions on this issue," blatantly coercing countries to support the US proposal. Scripps-Howard newspaper reporters even quoted senior US government officials as saying that Truman had "scolded Attlee" and threatened: "If Churchill were to govern in Britain again, he (referring to Truman) would have no difficulty in getting his plan to deal with Communist China accepted."

    Most importantly, the US conducted intensive diplomatic activities behind the scenes, exerting violent pressure on various countries. The US representative to the United Nations, Gross, hastily summoned British representative Jebb on the 23rd to discuss the matter. US Ambassador to Britain Gifford paid a special visit to British Prime Minister Attlee on the 25th. According to Agence France-Presse, Gifford threatened Britain at the time that if Britain did not support the US proposal, the US Congress might weaken its economic support for Britain. During this period, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th: British Ambassador to the US Franks was summoned to the US State Department almost every day.

    While using open intimidation, US imperialism also greatly employed its tricks of bribery. It used promises of reinforcing French aggression troops in Vietnam and helping the French government overcome its financial deficit to buy off French Prime Minister Pleven, who had run to Washington to seek help from Truman.

    The US government carried out similar coercion and bribery activities towards other countries that did not agree with the US's insistence on going its own way.

    Despite the US using all these shameless intimidation, coercion, and bribery tactics, making the US slanderous proposal barely pass in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the 30th, the US only obtained the fewest votes of approval in its voting record in the United Nations. This blatant rape cannot eliminate the widening divisions exposed between the United States and its servant countries in the passage of this incident.

　　美帝对美英集团各国施压力
    胁迫支持诬蔑我国案
    【新华社一日讯】自从一月二十二日以来，美帝国主义为了使联合国大会政治委员会通过其所提诬蔑我国为侵略者的诽谤案，曾穷凶极恶地对许多国家施行压力，胁迫它们支持美国提案，力图掩饰帝国主义阵营内部的已趋表面化的分裂。
    紧接着美国胁迫政委会迅速通过这一诽谤案失败（美联社曾称做“联合国五年历史中最惨的一次失败”）以后，美国垄断资本家的报纸立即对英、法、印度等国大肆咒骂和恫吓。华盛顿每日邮报二十四日说：“美国提案竟因英、法、加、印及亚洲集团投票而延搁，真是美国的奇耻大辱。”该报恼羞成怒地痛骂：“这些自认为我们友人的国家都是忘恩负义者流，英国投票反对……表现了英美友谊难予承认。”华盛顿邮报二十五日斥责英国“犯了严重的错误”，并威胁说：“美国和英国关于对付共产党中国的适当方针上所持意见之间的日益增大的鸿沟，势必造成大西洋两方进行慎重的三思。”纽约每日镜报二十五日更破口大骂道：“我们不能允许狡猾、诡计多端和圆滑的英国人用手腕玩弄我们，使我们完全孤立。”该报无赖地以美国退出联合国相恫吓说：美国应该撤出“联合国这个地狱的讲坛，我们不能让印度人和阿拉伯人来支配我们。我们不要让我们国家的荣誉与尊严在心想争得一点权力的一些最近才抛头露面的懦怯的国家所进行的赌博中成为赌注。”美国最大的广播公司哥伦比亚广播公司外交记者——华尔街的代言人西佛莱德在二十九日的广播中说：“我们一定已经到了一个荒谬的阶段。一营兵当中竟有若干士兵坐下来了，他们心里想这次战争是他们的营长与敌人之间的战斗，他们应该说服两方都丢弃作战的念头才好。”
    美国国会也大张旗鼓，行使压力。参议院继众议院在一月十九日通过要求联合国对美国提案“迅速行动”的决议以后，亦于二十三日通过决议，要联合国诬蔑我国为“侵略者”，并宣称阻挠我国进入联合国。这种举动，连美联社也不得不承认：“有很多人看到国会的行动会很愤慨，会认为这是对国际组织公开施以压力。”接着，美国总统杜鲁门又于二十四日也亲自出马，在记者招待会上发表声明，宣称美国政府“坚决支持”奥斯汀在联大政委会提出的提案，要胁各国“对这一问题必须作出自己的决定”，露骨地胁迫各国支持美国提案。斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸记者甚至引美国政府高级人士谈话说，杜鲁门曾“呵斥艾德礼”，并威胁说：“如果邱吉尔再度在英国执政，他（按指杜鲁门）将毫无困难地使他的对付共产党中国的计划得到接受。”
    最重要的，是美国在幕后进行了紧张的外交活动，对各国施以狂暴的压力。美国驻联合国代表葛罗斯，二十三日即匆匆召英国代表杰伯就此事进行会谈。美驻英大使吉福特曾于二十五日特别访问英国首相艾德礼。据法新社透露，吉福特当时威胁英国：如果英国不支持美国提案，美国国会可能削弱对英国经济的支持。在这一期间，据美联社华盛顿二十六日电透露：英国驻美大使佛朗克斯几乎每天都被召赴美国国务院。
    美帝国主义在使用公开的恫吓同时，还大施其利诱伎俩。它用增援法国在越南的侵略军队、帮助法国政府克服其财政赤字等诺言，来收买跑到华盛顿向杜鲁门求救的法国总理普利文。
    对于其他不赞成美国一意孤行的国家，美国政府都进行了类似的胁迫和收买活动。
    尽管美国用尽这一切无耻的恫吓、胁迫和利诱，使美国的诽谤案在三十日联大政委会上勉强通过，但是美国所获得的只是它在联合国投票记录中最少的同意票。这种公然的强奸丝毫也不能消弥美国及其仆从国家之间在通过这次事件中暴露出来的日趋扩大的分裂。
