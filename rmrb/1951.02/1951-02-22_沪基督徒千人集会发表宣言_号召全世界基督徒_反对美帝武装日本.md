Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th -- The Shanghai Christian Organizations' Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland and Defend the Country held a meeting on the 19th to oppose the United States rearming Japan. More than a thousand Christians attended. Wu Gaozi, Chairman of the National Christian Council of China, presided over the meeting. The meeting adopted the "Declaration of Shanghai Christians Against the United States Arming Japan." The full text of the declaration is as follows:

We, the Christians of Shanghai, resolutely oppose the United States' conspiracy to rearm Japan. The United States is rearming Japan in order to invade China and the Soviet Union and to undermine world peace. From the perspective of Christian doctrine, this crime of the United States should be condemned. We call on Christians in China, Asia, and the world, including Christians in the United States, to resolutely oppose the United States rearming Japan.

It is clearly the United States that is invading Korea, but it has manipulated the United Nations to illegally slander the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and our People's Republic of China as "aggressors." This trick of the United States in reversing right and wrong cannot deceive the people of the world. The people of the world know that the United States is the culprit in launching the war of aggression. Jesus Christ said, "Woe to you, hypocritical Pharisees!" The reactionary rulers of the United States have said all the nice things in the world, but have done all the bad things in the world, just like the Pharisees mentioned in the Bible. We must resolutely oppose this group of wolves in sheep's clothing.

We Chinese Christians must respond to the United States' slander against us and its conspiracy to arm Japan with practical actions. We must resolutely sever ties with imperialism and strive to establish a church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. We must expand and deepen the patriotic movement within the church. We must do a good job in registering with the government. We must thoroughly eliminate the remnants of American imperialism in the church.

During the "January 28th" Incident, Japanese imperialists brutally murdered the pastor and six members of the Hongde Church in Shanghai. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialists imprisoned many of our fellow Christians, including Mr. Zhao Zichen; they also slaughtered many of our fellow Christians and destroyed many of our churches. We must accuse Japanese imperialism of its cruelty towards our Chinese churches and Christians; we must resolutely oppose the United States rearming Japan.

The atrocities of the United States have aroused the public outrage of the people of the world. The Bible says, "The wages of sin is death." US imperialism has committed many injustices, invading Korea, massacring innocent people, slandering our China's righteous actions; and now, after the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, it is openly rearming Japan, undermining Asian peace, and seriously threatening world peace. The result will inevitably be the demise of US imperialism itself.

Believers in Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, all over the world! Rise up and take decisive action to oppose this US imperialism that is undermining world peace and launching wars of aggression!

　　沪基督徒千人集会发表宣言
    号召全世界基督徒反对美帝武装日本
    【新华社上海二十日电】上海市基督教团体抗美援朝保家卫国委员会于十九日举行反对美国重新武装日本大会，出席基督徒千余人。大会由中华全国基督教协进会主任委员吴高梓主持。大会通过了“上海市基督徒反对美国武装日本宣言”。宣言全文如下：
    我们全上海的基督徒要坚决反对美国重新武装日本的阴谋。美国重新武装日本，为的是要侵略中国、苏联，并破坏世界的和平。从基督教教义来看，美国这一个罪行是应该受到谴责的。我们要号召全中国、全亚洲、全世界的基督徒，包括美国的基督徒在内，来坚决反对美国重新武装日本。
    明明是美国侵略朝鲜，而它却操纵了联合国非法地诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与我们中华人民共和国为“侵略者”。美国这种颠倒是非的伎俩是欺骗不了世界人民的。全世界人民都知道美国是发动侵略战争的罪魁。耶稣基督曾说：“你们假冒为善的法利赛人有祸了。”美国的反动统治者说尽了天下好话，却做尽了天下坏事，与圣经上所说的法利赛人一般无二，我们要坚决反对这一群披着羊皮的豺狼。
    我们中国基督徒要以实际的行动来答复美国诬蔑我们与武装日本的阴谋。我们要坚决割断与帝国主义的关系，努力建立自治、自养、自传的教会。我们要在教会内扩大并深入地推进爱国主义运动。我们要办好向政府登记的工作。我们要彻底肃清教会里面美帝国主义的遗毒。
    日本帝国主义者曾在“一二八”时期残杀了上海鸿德堂的牧师与六位教友。在抗战时期，日本帝国主义者监禁了我们很多的教友，赵紫宸先生便是其中的一位；也屠杀了我们很多的教友，更破坏了我们不少的教堂。我们要控诉日本帝国主义对我们中国教会与基督徒的残害；我们要坚决反对美国重新武装日本。
    美国的暴行已经激起全世界人民的公愤。圣经上说：“罪的代价就是死。”美帝国主义多行不义，对朝鲜进行侵略，屠杀无辜人民，对我们中国的正义行动加以诬蔑；现在又在侵略朝鲜战争失败之后，明目张胆地重新武装日本，破坏亚洲和平，并严重地威胁世界和平，其结果，必然是美帝国主义本身的灭亡。
    全世界信奉和平之君耶稣基督的信徒们！快起来用坚决的行动反对这破坏世界和平发动侵略战争的美帝国主义！
  上海市基督教团体抗美援朝保家卫国委员会
        一九五一年二月十九日
