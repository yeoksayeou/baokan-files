The China National Grain Corporation Holds Storage Meeting
Summarizing Last Year's Work Experience and Arranging This Year's Storage Work

　　[Report from this newspaper] The China National Grain Corporation held a national grain storage meeting in Beijing on January 22nd to summarize and exchange experiences in grain storage work in 1950, and to study and arrange grain storage tasks for 1951, striving to prevent a single grain from spoiling in 1951.

　　In 1950, the grain stored in warehouses of the National Grain Corporation did not suffer serious losses due to frequent turning, airing, and sun-drying. The meeting concluded that: (1) The emphasis placed on grain storage work by leaders at all levels of the Grain Corporation in 1950, and their personal involvement, was the main key to storing grain well. (2) Due to a lack of experience last year, the turning, airing, and sun-drying of grain wasted a great deal of manpower and financial resources. Grain with high moisture content was dried multiple times, increasing commodity circulation costs. In 1951, efforts should be made to dry grain in one go to save manpower and financial resources. (3) Uniting and educating workers, and leveraging the strength of the masses, is a prerequisite for storing grain well. Only by organizing workers and forming a mass grain protection movement can the goal of preventing grain spoilage be achieved. (4) Close cooperation with local governments is essential to doing a good job in grain storage. (5) The exemplary role of model workers in creating solutions has a great impact on grain protection work. For example, Comrade Yu Jusheng of the East China Grain Corporation worked actively and responsibly, carrying out his work with a selfless spirit of hard work and dedication. He actively studied and created a poisonous gas fumigation method to kill insects, saving more than 1.1 million packages of grain. Comrade Yu Jusheng's exemplary action greatly promoted grain protection work in various warehouses in Shanghai. (6) The system of division of responsibility for grain storage is an effective way to strengthen cadres' sense of responsibility, improve work efficiency, and ensure that grain does not spoil.

　　The meeting also pointed out that the tasks for 1951 are greater. The current inventory of grain is twice as large as last year, and the national grain moisture content is generally higher than last year. For example, the moisture content in coarse grain areas is as high as 18%, while in fine grain areas (rice) it is as high as 20%, and generally between 16% and 18%. Therefore, the overall requirement is to do a good job in storage and strive to prevent a single grain from spoiling. Specific requirements are: to carry out turning and sun-drying in a planned way, strengthen economic accounting, and prevent waste. Reduce grain moisture content according to regulations, carry out grain consolidation work, improve grain quality, and gradually achieve commodity standardization. It is also necessary to unite and rely on the worker masses to carry out a mass grain protection movement, establish grain protection organizations, strictly establish various systems (such as inspection, reporting, and summarizing), summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner, and launch work competition campaigns.

　　中国粮食公司举行保管会议
    总结去年工作经验布置今年保管工作
    【本报讯】中国粮食公司于一月二十二日在北京举行全国粮食保管会议，总结与交流了一九五○年粮食保管工作经验和研究、布置了一九五一年粮食保管任务，争取在一九五一年不霉坏一粒粮食。
    一九五○年全国粮食公司仓库中保管的粮食由于经常翻倒晾晒，尚未遭受严重的损失。会议认为：（一）一九五○年粮食公司各级领导重视粮食保管工作，并亲自动手，是存好粮食的主要关键。（二）去年由于经验缺乏，翻倒晾晒粮食中，浪费了很大的人力、财力，水份大的粮食分成了数次晒干，加大了商品流转费。一九五一年应作到一次晒干，以节省人力、财力。（三）团结教育工人，发挥群众力量，是保管好粮食的先决条件。只有把工人组织起来，形成群众性的护粮运动，才能达到不坏粮食的目的。（四）必须与当地政府密切结合，才能作好粮食保管工作。（五）通过模范工作者的带头作用，创造办法，对护粮工作有很大作用。如华东区粮食公司于菊生同志积极负责，以任劳任怨的忘我精神进行工作，积极钻研，创造了毒气薰蒸法，进行杀虫，挽救了一百一十余万包粮食。于菊生同志这一模范行动，对上海各仓库的护粮工作，起了很大的推动作用。（六）粮食保管的分工负责制，是加强干部责任心，提高工作效率，保证粮食不坏的有效办法之一。
    会议又指出：一九五一年的任务加大了，现在库存粮食数字比去年加大了一倍，粮食水份全国普遍比去年高，如粗粮区水份高者达百分之十八，细粮区（大米）高者达百分之二十，一般的在百分之十六至十八。因此，总的要求是做好保管工作，争取不坏一粒粮食；具体要求是：有计划地进行翻晒，加强经济核算，防止浪费。按规定降低粮食水份，开展粮食整装工作，提高粮食质量，逐渐达到商品规格化。并应团结与依靠工人群众，开展群众性的护粮运动。建立护粮组织；严格地树立各种制度（如检查、报告、总结），及时总结，交流经验，和开展工作竞赛运动。（中国粮食公司储运处）
