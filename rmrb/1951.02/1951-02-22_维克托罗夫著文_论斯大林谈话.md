Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th: True Light commentator Viktorov, in his international review entitled "The Road to Peace," commented on Stalin's talk, stating: The attention of the people of all countries in the world is focused on the talk given by Stalin to a reporter from True Light. Peace-loving people of all countries, progressive humanity, all those who have not been poisoned by the malicious propaganda of imperialism and can still soberly and objectively assess the development of today's situation, those who have not lost their conscience due to the desire for profit and the acquisition of money, all believe that Stalin's talk is another extremely convincing proof of the Soviet Union's peace policy, an extremely important document for defending peace, and a program of struggle to strive for peace and oppose the imperialists who are instigating another world war.

Viktorov pointed out that countless commentaries on Stalin's talk have particularly emphasized Stalin's historically significant statement that a world war cannot be considered inevitable at present, which is not accidental. Stalin's remarks clearly point out the road to peace and the methods to guarantee peace, and therefore have attracted even more attention. The front of peace is strong and great. The Soviet Union defends peace and is the head of the peace and democracy camp. The working people of the people's democratic countries, all those in capitalist countries who bravely participate in the peace movement, are fighting for peace, and the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are taking up arms to defend the cause of peace. Viktorov then said: Imperialist aggressors are trying to obstruct the peace movement. They use all means, sparing no lies and slanders to deceive the people, and use fraudulent means to drag them into another world war that the American ruling clique is arranging. Stalin's talk exposed the warmongers and their fabricated defamatory propaganda, and drew a clear line between the forces of peace and the forces of aggression.

Viktorov revealed: The ruling cliques of the United States, Britain, and other aggressive countries and their profiteering newspapers use despicable tricks to divert people's attention from the major issues raised in Stalin's talk. The strength of the blow suffered by the lying propaganda of imperialism can be seen from their despicable tricks. The statements hastily prepared by the British Foreign Office and the US State Department are characterized not by what these "documents" say, but by what they do not say. The British Foreign Office did not answer the following questions: Why did the British government reject the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations for the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, China, and France to immediately conclude a peace treaty? Why did the British government reject the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately begin disarmament and immediately ban atomic weapons? Why does the British government persecute peace advocates? Why is the peace conference prohibited from being held in Britain? Can the movement to defend peace threaten Britain's security? Anyone who wants to find answers to these questions in the US State Department's statement will be in vain. The statements of the British Foreign Office and the US State Department once again prove that the American and British ruling cliques are trying in every possible way to deceive their people, trap them in a web of lies, in order to impose a policy of arms race on them and drag them into another world war. In particular, from the indisputable facts that the US-British bloc is engaged in an arms race, carrying out bloody aggression against the Korean people and the People's Republic of China, and turning the United Nations into a tool for US imperialism, these statements clearly confirm how correct and thorough Stalin's analysis of the international situation is. The official statements of the American and British ruling cliques are clearly completely false.

Viktorov wrote in conclusion that Stalin's talk to the True Light reporter has aroused the broadest masses of the people and raised the vigilance of the people of all countries against the conspiracies of the warmongers. The powerful peace front will more closely unite its ranks and redouble its efforts to fight for peace and against the imperialist war-mongers.

　　维克托罗夫著文  论斯大林谈话
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：真理报评论家维克托罗夫在其国际述评中以“到达和平的道路”为题，评论斯大林的谈话称：世界上一切国家的人民的注意力，都集中在斯大林对真理报记者所发表的谈话上。爱好和平的各国人民，进步人类，一切没有被帝国主义的恶毒宣传所毒害而仍能清醒地并客观地估计今天的事态发展的人们，没有因为贪得利润与攫取金钱的欲望而丧失天良的人们，全都认为斯大林的谈话是苏联和平政策的又一次极其令人信服的证明，是保卫和平的极重要的文献，是争取和平反对煽动另一次世界战争的帝国主义者的斗争纲领。
    维克托罗夫指出，数不清的关于斯大林谈话的评论，都特别强调斯大林关于目前不能认为世界战争不可避免的具有历史意义的一段话，这并不是偶然的。斯大林的言论清楚地指出到达和平的道路及保证和平的方法，因此更加受到注目。和平的阵线是强大的和伟大的。苏联捍卫着和平，它是和平与民主阵营的首脑。人民民主国家的劳动人民、资本主义国家中一切英勇参加和平运动的人们，正在为和平而斗争，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士们，正在拿起武器保卫和平事业。维克托罗夫接着说：帝国主义侵略者企图阻挠和平运动。他们使用了一切手段，不惜以谎言和诬蔑来欺骗人民，并用欺诈手段把他们拖入美国统治集团正在安排的另一次世界战争。斯大林的谈话揭穿了战争贩子以及他们虚构的诽谤宣传，并在和平力量和侵略力量间划出了明确的分界线。
    维克托罗夫揭露：美国、英国以及其他侵略国家的统治集团和它们的唯利是图的报纸，使用卑鄙诡计来转移人们对斯大林谈话中所提出的各项大问题的注意力。帝国主义的说谎宣传所遭到的打击的力量，可以从它们这种卑鄙的诡计看出来。英国外交部和美国国务院所匆忙准备的声明的特点，不在于这些“文件”中所说的话，而在于它们所没有说的话。英国外交部没有答复下列问题：为什么英国政府拒绝了苏联在联合国提出的关于苏、英、美、中、法立即缔结和平公约的建议呢？为什么英国政府拒绝了苏联关于立即开始裁减军备及立即禁止原子武器的建议呢？为什么英国政府迫害和平拥护者呢？为什么禁止和平大会在英国召开？难道保卫和平的运动能威胁英国的安全吗？谁要想在美国国务院的声明中寻找对于这些问题的答复，那是徒然的。英国外交部和美国国务院的声明，再次证明美国和英国统治集团力图千方百计地来欺骗他们的人民，用谎言的罗网陷害他们，以便把军备竞赛政策强加于他们身上，并把他们拖入另一次世界战争。特别是从美英集团进行军备竞赛，对朝鲜人民和中华人民共和国进行血腥侵略，以及把联合国变成美帝国主义服务的工具这些不可争辩的事实来看，这些声明明显地证实斯大林对国际局势的分析是如何正确和透彻。美国和英国统治集团的正式声明分明是完全虚妄的。
    维克托罗夫在结语中写道，斯大林对真理报记者的谈话已经唤起了最广大的人民群众，唤起了并提高了各国人民对战争贩子的阴谋的警觉。强大的和平阵线将更加紧密地团结自己的队伍，加倍努力为争取和平、反对帝国主义战争制造者而斗争。
