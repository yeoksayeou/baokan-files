The Central Ministry of Justice Reviews Ideological Deviations of Judicial Cadres in Last Year's Rectification Movement
    Corrects Errors in One-Sided Emphasis on Education and Rehabilitation of Criminals
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Central People's Government Ministry of Justice, in its rectification movement last year, examined its judicial work over the past year and discovered many problems and deviations. In the past year, the Ministry has made considerable achievements in abolishing the old judicial system, establishing a new people's judicial system, clearing away the influence of old laws, and establishing the policy viewpoints of people's justice, due to the conscientious implementation of Article 17 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. However, due to the policy thinking deviations and a certain degree of empiricism among the Party member cadres working in the judicial departments, many deviations were manifested in the work.

    First, it neglected to supervise the judicial organs at all levels to conscientiously implement the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It did not ask or hear about the "boundless leniency" deviations that occurred in various places, nor did it feel its seriousness. In the past revolutionary war period, because the judicial organs were not sound enough, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was mainly carried out by the public security departments, so that some judicial cadres still lack the concept of "suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the first task of judicial work" in their thinking, mistakenly believing that the judicial organs mainly handle general civil and criminal cases, and invisibly abandon their responsibility of cooperating with public security, procuratorial and other departments to vigorously suppress counter-revolutionary activities.

    Secondly, in handling criminal cases of general criminals, instead of combining punishment and education, it unilaterally emphasized "education." Many judicial cadres mistakenly believed that the handling of criminal cases should be "education-oriented and punishment-supplemented"; the handling of civil cases should be "mediation-oriented and trial-supplemented"; especially in prison management, instead of combining punishment and control with education and rehabilitation, they unilaterally implemented the policy of "education and rehabilitation." Since the establishment of the Central Ministry of Justice, it has not only failed to criticize this erroneous thinking in replying to reports from various places, inspecting work in various places, and training cadres from various places, but has instead spread this erroneous thinking. After the prisoner riot in Jinzhou at the beginning of last year, although the slogan "Prison is a tool of the dictatorship" was put forward, it was not implemented until the judicial conference due to insufficient ideological understanding. Therefore, in the past year, except for some areas that still inherited the old prison style and abused, beat, and mistreated prisoners, most of them unilaterally regarded prisons as "schools," "factories," or "medical institutions" for curing diseases and saving people, rather than state punishment organs for criminals. Many places do not call prisons prisons, but "prisoner rehabilitation centers" or "education centers," and do not call prisoners prisoners, but "introspection members," or even "classmates." Some prisons, in order to "become self-sufficient in production," let prisoners out to engage in production indiscriminately, losing the role of punishment and education. Some, in order to encourage prisoners to produce, excessively improved the living conditions of prisoners, causing dissatisfaction among the working people; or abused commutation and parole, damaging the seriousness of the law. Some even advocated "democratic management" and "relying on prisoners," abandoning the leadership and control of prisons. Others, due to ideological paralysis and lax control, resulted in many prisons escaping, even rioting. For example, in the prison in Mei County, Shaanxi, a riot occurred, and 32 prisoners escaped, including 11 counter-revolutionaries, seizing 32 guns and 5 machine guns, killing and wounding 2 of our personnel each. Therefore, the masses blamed the prison for "not being secure."

    Thirdly, they rarely seriously study and summarize the materials and experiences reported from below, thus forming blindness in their work. For example, for a long time, they paid too much attention to issues such as judicial staffing, prisoner rations, and funding, but did not grasp the supervision of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; did not grasp the ideological construction of the judicial departments and the task of training cadres.

    The most fundamental reason for the above deviations is that some cadres have insufficient understanding that the courts, prisons, the army, and the police are all weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. In analyzing the role of the people's judicial work, they overemphasize its educational significance and indiscriminately stick to the "benevolent government" thinking of "winning hearts and minds" and "education is omnipotent." Secondly, they underestimated the activities of counter-revolutionaries. After the victory of the revolution, they lacked sufficient vigilance against the unrepentant counter-revolutionaries who generally moved from open to secret activities. Some cadres even developed a sense of complacency, so that when "boundless leniency" deviations occurred in various places, they failed to point them out and correct them in time. In the past year, although the Ministry has done some inspection work, it has not listed "investigation and research" as one of the important tasks, and has not taken it as the basis for formulating policies and determining tasks. Precisely because they did not study and comprehensively analyze the situation below well, they could not discover problems in time, make decisions, and implement strong policy guidance.

    In order to correct the above deviations, the Ministry has decided that in the future, in addition to strengthening cadres' policy viewpoints and investigation and research, it will also determine the current key tasks of the Ministry of Justice: First, to strengthen ideological construction and supervise the people's courts in various places to implement the central judicial policies; second, to train cadres, run national on-the-job judicial cadre training classes (experience has proved that this is a good way to train cadres and lead work in various places) and the New Law Research Institute, and help with legal education in various universities, in order to carry out the task of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　中央司法部在去年整风运动中  检讨司法干部思想偏向         
    纠正对罪犯片面强调教育改造的错误
    【本报讯】中央人民政府司法部在去年的整风运动中，检查了一年来的司法工作，发现不少问题和偏差。该部一年中由于认真执行了人民政协共同纲领第十七条的规定，在废除旧司法制度，建立新的人民司法制度，廓清旧法律影响，建立人民司法的政策观点上，已作出相当成绩。但由于在司法部门中工作的党员干部政策思想有偏向和某种程度的经验主义，以致在工作中表现了不少偏差。
    首先是忽略了督导各级司法机关认真执行镇压反革命的政策，对各地发生“宽大无边”偏向不问不闻，亦不感觉其严重性。在过去革命战争时期，由于司法机关不够健全，镇压反革命工作主要在公安部门执行，致使有些司法干部至今在思想上还缺乏“镇压反革命是司法工作的第一位任务”的观念，错误地认为司法机关主要是受理一般民刑案件，无形中放弃了与公安、检察等部门通力合作，有力地镇压反革命活动的职责。
    其次，在处理一般犯罪分子的刑事案件中，不是惩罚与教育相结合，而是片面地强调“教育”。许多司法干部错误地认为处理刑事案件要以“教育为主、惩罚为辅”；处理民事案件要以“调解为主、审判为辅”；特别在监狱管理上，不是以惩罚管制与教育改造相结合，而是片面地执行着“教育改造”的方针。中央司法部成立以来，在批复各地报告、视察各地工作与调训各地干部中，不但没有批判这种错误思想，反而传播了这种错误思想。去年初锦州发生犯人暴乱事件后，虽曾提出“监狱是专政的工具”的口号；但由于思想认识不够明确，直到司法会议之前，均未贯彻下去。故一年中，除有部分地区仍因袭旧监狱作风，对犯人滥施打骂和虐待外，一般都片面地把监狱视为“学校”、“工厂”或治病救人的“医疗机关”，而不是国家对犯罪分子的惩罚机关。有很多地方不把监狱叫做监狱，而叫做“犯人改造院”或“教育所”，不叫犯人做犯人而称为“反省员”，甚至称“同学”。有的监所为了要“生产自给”，便把犯人放出去乱搞生产，丧失惩罚与教育的作用。有的为了鼓舞犯人生产，过分地改善犯人生活，引起了劳动人民的不满；或滥予减刑、假释，损害了法纪的严肃性。有的甚至提倡“民主管理”和“依靠犯人”，放弃了监所的领导和管制。还有的由于思想麻痹、管制松懈，致有不少监狱发生犯人逃亡，甚至暴乱事件。如陕西郿县监所发生暴乱，逃走犯人三十二名，内有反革命分子十一名，夺去枪枝三十二支，机枪五挺，击毙和击伤我人员各二人。因之，群众责备监狱“监而不牢”。
    其三，对下面报告来的材料和经验，很少认真研究与总结，因而形成工作上的盲目性。譬如长时间曾过多的去注意司法编制、囚粮及经费等问题，而没有抓紧对镇压反革命工作的督导；没有抓紧司法部门的思想建设与培养干部的任务。
    产生以上偏差的最基本的原因，是某些干部对法庭、监狱、军队与警察同是人民民主专政的武器认识不足。在分析人民司法工作的作用中，过分强调其教育意义，无区别地墨守着“攻心为上”与“教育万能”的“仁政”思想。其次是对反革命的活动估计不足，在革命胜利之后，对一般由公开转入秘密的怙恶不悛的反革命分子，缺乏足够的警惕性，甚至有些干部滋长了太平观念，致在各地发生“宽大无边”的偏向时，未能即时加以指出和纠正。一年来该部虽曾作了一些视察工作，但未将“调查研究”列为重要任务之一，并没有把它作为制定政策、确定任务的基础。正由于没有很好研究、综合下面情况，因而也不能及时发现问题，做出决定，实行有力的政策指导。
    为了纠正上述偏差，该部决在今后除加强干部的政策观点与调查研究外，并确定目前司法部的工作重点：一是加强思想建设，并督导各地人民法院对中央司法政策的执行；二是培养干部，办好全国在职的司法干部轮训班（经验证明：这是训练干部，领导各地工作的好方式）及新法学研究院，并帮助各大学的法律教育，以便执行坚决镇压反革命的任务。
