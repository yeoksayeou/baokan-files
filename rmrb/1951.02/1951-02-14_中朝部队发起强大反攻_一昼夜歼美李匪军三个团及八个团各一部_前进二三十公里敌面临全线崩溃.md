　　Xinhua News Agency, Han River Front, Thirteenth Urgent Dispatch: The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a powerful counterattack against the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army south of the Han River on the night of the 11th of this month. In one day and night, by the evening of the 12th, our armies bravely attacked and advanced twenty to thirty kilometers, and basically annihilated a total of three regiments—the 10th, 16th, and 20th—of the Syngman Rhee bandit army’s 8th Division in the area more than ten kilometers west of Hoengseong. At the same time, we also annihilated parts of the 22nd and 23rd Regiments of the Syngman Rhee bandit army’s 3rd Division, and the 27th, 35th, and 36th Regiments of the 5th Division, as well as parts of the 9th, 38th Regiments of the American invading army’s 2nd Division and the 17th Regiment of the 7th Division. Now our army is advancing south with overwhelming force.
　　Since the 25th of last month, the invading armies of the United States, Britain, Turkey, and others, as well as the Syngman Rhee bandit army, have concentrated more than 200,000 of their main forces and frantically invaded our Han River south bank positions from Hoengseong in the east to the coast of Incheon in the west. After eighteen days and nights of tenacious resistance by our army, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Now that our army has launched a counterattack, the enemy is facing total collapse.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Han River Front, Thirteenth Dispatch: Before launching the counterattack, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers heavily damaged the invading army on the Han River's south bank in front of Seoul. On the 10th of this month, a unit of our army killed or wounded more than a hundred invading enemy soldiers in a bridgehead on the south bank of the Han River. Our front-line units destroyed a total of thirteen enemy tanks and shot down two enemy planes in combat on this day. In the battle at the Bongeunsa Temple bridgehead, a certain artillery unit of our artillery accurately fired and hit the enemy's dense formation, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and covered our infantry's attack, thus winning commendation from the higher authorities. On the morning of the 11th, a certain unit of our front line completely annihilated more than a hundred enemies who attempted to steal across the river near the Han River Railway Bridge. On this day, our front-line units again destroyed five enemy tanks and shot down one enemy plane on the Han River's south bank front line.
