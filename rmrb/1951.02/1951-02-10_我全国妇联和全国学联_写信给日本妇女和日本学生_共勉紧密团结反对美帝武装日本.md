Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in order to oppose the US imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, has sent a letter to Japanese women. The full text is as follows:

Japanese sisters:

US imperialism has suffered serious blows from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war of aggression against Korea. In order to save its precarious fate, US imperialism is still continuing its aggression plan and is stepping up its unilateral peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan. The purpose of this sinister plot is to make Japan a US military base and to make the broad masses of the Japanese people act as their cannon fodder for aggression. Therefore, this conspiracy is threatening the interests of the people of the Far East and the interests of the Japanese people.

The brutal and cowardly US imperialism has always used the armies of its vassal states as shields in the war of aggression against Korea. Many of the armies of these vassal states and the US aggressor troops have been annihilated or captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. We believe that the Japanese people and women are definitely unwilling to have their husbands and sons act as vassal troops to serve the US imperialist aggression.

The people and women of China and Japan have both suffered from the disasters of US imperialist war of aggression. We should join hands to oppose our common enemy—US imperialism and its aggression plan.

We Chinese women have always sympathized with and supported the great struggle of the Japanese people and women against US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. We have always insisted on the rapid conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and, according to the Potsdam Proclamation, to thoroughly eliminate the forces of Japanese militarism, so that Japan can become a democratic country.

Japanese sisters! For the safety of your husbands and sons, for a peaceful and happy life, rise up and join the entire Japanese people in opposing the US sinister plan to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, and drive US imperialism out of Japan!

The Chinese people, all the people of Asia, and the people of the world support you. Your struggle will surely be victorious.

                                 All-China Democratic Women's Federation

[Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The All-China Students' Federation wrote a letter to Japanese students on the 3rd, opposing the United States' rearmament of Japan. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the National Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, transferred to all students in Japan:

We Chinese students are angrily watching the conspiracies that the US imperialists have recently intensified in your country. In recent years, the US imperialists have been stubbornly turning Japan into a colony and military base, completely tearing up all international agreements on democratizing Japan and concluding a fair and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, thereby seriously violating the interests of the Japanese people and the people of the world. Now, after suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea, the US imperialists are even more hurriedly conducting a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan in order to drive Japanese youth to serve as cannon fodder for the US war of aggression. In October of last year, US Brigadier General Roberts openly declared in Los Angeles: "Why can't we use Filipinos or Japanese to fight? We only need to give them five US dollars a month and a bowl of rice a day. No food is given if they don't fight!" Also in mid-December of the same year, MacArthur Headquarters secretly ordered the Japanese government to rebuild the land, sea, and air forces led by Americans in order to prepare for a desperate offensive against the people of Asia on behalf of the US aggressors. Obviously, this crime will first cause great disasters to Japanese youth students and people; at the same time, it will definitely arouse the firm and unanimous opposition of the people of all Asia, especially the 475 million Chinese people!

Japanese students! In the past, you have carried out many heroic struggles, exposing the hideous face of US imperialism and powerfully attacking its conspiracy to enslave the Japanese people. We firmly believe that you will definitely join the Japanese people in the future to more firmly carry out the struggle against the unilateral conclusion of a peace treaty and the rearmament of Japan. Let us unite closely with the people and young students of Eastern countries and strive for a comprehensive and just peace treaty and a non-militarist democratic Japan! There is no doubt that justice belongs to us and not to our common enemy, the US imperialists. Its complete failure on the Chinese mainland and its disastrous defeat in Korea have fully proved that the US imperialists are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and can be completely defeated. It will definitely suffer even greater failures in the future.

                            All-China Students' Federation, February 3rd

　　我全国妇联和全国学联
    写信给日本妇女和日本学生           
    共勉紧密团结反对美帝武装日本
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为反对美帝国主义对日片面媾和及重新武装日本的阴谋，特致书日本妇女。全文如下：日本姊妹们：
    美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中已遭到朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的严重打击。为了挽救其垂危的命运，美帝国主义仍在继续坚持其侵略计划，并加紧进行对日单独媾和、重新武装日本。这一罪恶阴谋的目的，就是使日本成为美国的军事基地，使广大日本人民充当他们的侵略炮灰。因此，这个阴谋正威胁着远东人民的利益，也威胁着日本人民的利益。
    残暴又懦怯的美帝国主义，在侵朝战争中，一直以附庸国家的军队作挡箭牌。这些附庸国家的军队和美国侵略军队很多被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军歼灭了，有的当了俘虏。我们相信，日本人民和妇女是决不愿意自己的丈夫和儿子充当附庸军，为美帝国主义的侵略行为服务的。
    中日两国人民和妇女都曾经遭受过美帝国主义侵略战争的灾难，我们应当携起手来，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义及其侵略计划。
    我们中国妇女一向是同情并支持日本人民和妇女反抗美帝国主义和日本反动派的伟大斗争的。我们一贯坚持主张迅速缔结全面对日和约，根据波茨坦公告，彻底肃清日本军国主义势力，使得日本成为一个民主化的国家。
    日本姊妹们！为了你们丈夫儿子的安全，为了和平安乐的生活，起来和全日本人民一道，反对美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本的罪恶计划，把美帝国主义赶出日本去！
    中国人民、全亚洲以及全世界人民都是支持你们的。你们的斗争一定会胜利。
                                 中华全国民主妇女联合会
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中华全国学生联合会为反对美国重新武装日本，于三日写信给日本学生。该信全文如下：全日本学生自治会联合总会转日本全国同学们：
    我们中国学生正愤怒地注视着美帝国主义者最近在你们国土上加紧进行的阴谋活动。近年来，美帝国主义者一意孤行地使日本殖民地化和军事基地化，彻底地撕毁了所有关于使日本民主化和早日缔结公正的全面的对日和约的国际协议，因而严重地违背了日本人民和世界人民的利益。现在，美帝国主义者在朝鲜遭到惨败以后，更加急急忙忙地进行单独缔结对日和约，重新武装日本，以便驱使日本青年充当美国侵略战争的炮灰。去年十月，美国军官罗伯茨准将就曾在洛杉矶公然宣称：“为什么我们不能利用菲律宾人或日本人作战呢？我们只要每月给他们五块美金，每天一碗大米饭就够了。不作战就不给饭吃！”又在同年十二月中，麦克阿瑟总部曾密令日本政府重建以美国人为领导的陆、海、空军，以便准备替美国侵略者向亚洲人民进行绝望的进攻。显然，这种罪行首先要使日本青年学生和人民身受极大的灾害；同时一定要引起全亚洲人民，首先是四亿七千五百万中国人民坚决一致的反对！
    日本的同学们！过去你们曾经进行过多次英勇的斗争，揭露了美帝国主义的狰狞面目，有力地打击了它企图奴役日本人民的阴谋。我们深信：你们今后一定会和日本人民一道，更加坚定地开展反对片面缔结和约和武装日本的斗争。让我们与东方各国的人民和青年学生紧密地团结起来，为争取全面的公正的和约和非军国主义的民主的日本而奋斗！毫无疑问，正义属于我们而不属于我们共同的敌人美帝国主义者，它在中国大陆上的彻底的失败和在朝鲜的惨败已充分证明：美帝国主义者是外强中干的，是完全可以打败的，它今后一定还要遭到更大的失败。
