　　Suggestion to Strengthen Train Propaganda Work
    Editor:
    A few days ago, I took the Jinghan Railway train home and saw that the propaganda work on the train was done very well. For example, holding passenger representative forums, publicizing current affairs to passengers and soliciting opinions on the train, etc.; when passing the Yellow River Iron Bridge, the propagandist explained the importance of the Yellow River Iron Bridge to the passengers; the train staff were also busy promoting various books and newspapers, serving the passengers. These things gave me a strong impression: the people's railway industry has made rapid progress.
    At the same time, I have the following suggestions for propaganda work on the train:
    First, when passing through places with historical sites, scenic spots, or famous cities along the railway line, these scenic spots and historical sites should be introduced to strengthen the patriotic ideological education of passengers. For example, on the Jinghan Railway, the capital of the motherland, Beijing, can be introduced, explaining the progress of various construction works in Beijing after liberation. When passing the Yellow River Iron Bridge, it can be explained how the Chiang Kai-shek bandits destroyed the iron bridge when they fled, and how the People's Government repaired the iron bridge. On the Jing Sui Railway, the Chinese engineer Zhan Tianyou can be introduced... This will greatly help to inspire the people's patriotic enthusiasm. It is also suggested that relevant authorities compile these things into propaganda manuals or make them into records to help train propagandists carry out propaganda.
    Second, I saw that the comrades on the train used the form of "Lianhualao" (a type of folk performance) to sing the railway regulations to the passengers, which was very popular and effective. I think the government's policies and laws, such as the Land Reform Law, the Marriage Law, and the Trade Union Law, can also be publicized through forms that the masses like to hear and see, which will have a very good effect. Because passengers have nothing to do during the journey, they will listen to these introductions very carefully.

### 建议加强列车宣传工作

　　建议加强列车宣传工作
    编辑同志：
    前些天，我乘京汉路火车回家，看见列车上的宣传工作做得非常好。例如：开旅客代表座谈会，向乘客宣传时事及征求对列车的意见等；在路过黄河铁桥时，宣传员更向旅客说明黄河铁桥的重要性；列车工作人员又忙碌着推销各种书报，为乘客服务。这些事情给我一个强烈的印象：人民的铁道事业有了飞速地进展。
    同时，我对于列车上的宣传工作，有如下建议：
    第一，通过铁路沿线有古迹、名胜的地方或著名城市时，应对这些名胜、古迹等加以介绍，以加强对旅客的爱国主义思想教育。如在京汉路上，可介绍祖国的首都——北京，说明解放后北京的各种建设工作的进展情况。路经黄河铁桥时，可说明蒋匪临逃时怎样把铁桥炸毁，人民政府如何把铁桥修复等。在京绥路上，则可以介绍中国的工程师詹天佑……，这样，对于启发人民的爱国热情，是有很大帮助的。并建议有关机关将这些东西编成宣传手册，或制成唱片，帮助列车宣传员进行宣传。
    第二，我见到列车上的同志把铁道规章用“莲花落”的形式编唱给旅客听，很受欢迎，效果也很大。我觉得也可以通过群众喜闻乐见的形式，宣传政府的政策、法令，如土地改革法、婚姻法、工会法等，这样会收到很好的效果的。因为旅客在旅途中没有事情可做，会很用心听这些介绍的。
