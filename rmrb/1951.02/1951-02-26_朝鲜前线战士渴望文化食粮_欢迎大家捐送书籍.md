　　Frontline Korean Warriors Yearn for Cultural Food – Donations of Books Welcomed
　　To the Editors:
　　Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers on the Korean front are extremely eager for cultural reading materials sent from the motherland. To meet the needs of the soldiers, last December we volunteered to go to Korea to deliver cultural food and immediately brought new books worth 600 million yuan (Northeast currency); in late January, another batch of new books was shipped from Shenyang. With the help of the Volunteer Army Propaganda Department, we launched a mobile exhibition and lending service. In the Fourth Company of a certain regiment, eighty new books were borrowed at once. Soldiers were unwilling to put down their books even while eating, reading as they ate; at night, soldiers read collectively under the dim light of oil lamps. When the soldiers learned that we were moving to a new location, they repeatedly pleaded with us, unanimously requesting, "Comrades of the mobile bookstore—library, please don't leave! Stay with our company forever!" The comrades of the engineering company urged, "Why don't you come to our company!"
　　Soldiers particularly love to read Soviet novels depicting war, such as "Days and Nights" and "How the Steel Was Tempered." Soldiers also greatly enjoy comic strips with new content. After our comrades introduced the book "The Female Hero Who Grew Up in Hardship," thirteen soldiers read the book and spontaneously organized discussions. We and the soldiers were delighted to hear that the Xinhua Bookstore is collecting books nationwide to send to the Korean front. Based on our experience, we would like to offer a suggestion to comrades who are preparing to donate books: in the selection of books, soldiers greatly love heroic stories, revolutionary stories, new ballads, clappers, rhymes, songs, etc.; they especially like works about themselves. In addition, we also hope that national literary and art workers and translators can, according to the soldiers' requests, continuously supply the People's Publishing House with new creations or translations, so that they can be published in large quantities to supply the Volunteer Army with cultural food.
　　All Comrades of the Mobile Branch Library of the Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore

### 朝鲜前线战士渴望文化食粮  欢迎大家捐送书籍

　　朝鲜前线战士渴望文化食粮
    欢迎大家捐送书籍
    编辑同志：
    我们的人民志愿军战士，在朝鲜前线异常渴望祖国送去的文化读物。为满足战士们的要求，去年十二月我们自愿赴朝输送文化食粮，当即带去价值六亿元（东北币）的新书；一月下旬，又由沈阳运去新书一批。在志愿军宣传部帮助下，我们就展开了巡回展览借阅工作。在某团四连，一次即借出新书八十本。战士们吃饭都不肯把书搁下，一边吃，一边看；夜里，战士们就在暗淡的油灯下集体阅读。当战士们知道我们要转移地址时，他们一再挽留，一致要求“随军书店——图书室的同志，你们不要走啦！永远在我们连里吧！”工兵连的同志却又催促说：“你们怎么不到我们连里去呢！”
    战士们非常爱读描写战争的苏联小说，如《日日夜夜》、《钢铁是怎样练成的》等。新内容的连环图画，战士们也十分喜欢。《在坚苦中长成的女英雄》一书经过我们工作同志介绍之后，阅读该书的就有十三个战士，并且自动的组织了讨论。听说新华书店已在全国范围内募集书籍运送朝鲜前线，我们和战士们听了都很高兴。根据我们的体会，愿对准备捐送书籍的同志们提一点建议：在书的选择上，战士们很喜爱英雄故事、革命故事、新的鼓词、快板、顺口溜、歌曲等；更欢喜描写他们自己有关的作品。此外，我们并希望全国文艺工作者、翻译家们，能根据战士的要求，源源不断地供给人民出版社新的创作或译本，以便大量出版，供应志愿部队文化食粮。
