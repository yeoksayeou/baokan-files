　　Qingyuan County Government Should Inspect Preferential Treatment Work
    Family of Military Personnel Experiencing Difficulties, Unit Sent Four Letters, But They Were Ignored.
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a revolutionary soldier, currently stationed with my unit in Hami, Xinjiang.
    My home is in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province (The letter did not specify the district or village. - Editor). There are only three elderly people over sixty years old at home, and my father is also ill; therefore, the family's life is very difficult. I asked the Political Department of my division to write to the Qingyuan County People's Government, asking them to understand my family's actual situation and provide appropriate preferential treatment. The Political Department sent four letters continuously at the end of 1949 and in 1950, but the Qingyuan County People's Government and the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have never responded.
    Based on letters from my family, the Qingyuan County People's Government has still not given my family preferential treatment according to the actual situation. I believe that the Qingyuan County People's Government's attitude of ignoring the problems of revolutionary soldiers' families is wrong. I hope you will urge them to correct it.
                                                   Li Ruilin
    Editor's Note: If Comrade Li Ruilin's reflections are true, the Qingyuan County People's Government should examine its work attitude and the progress of preferential treatment work.

　　清苑县府应检查优抚工作        
    军属生活困难，部队四次去信，竟置之不理。
    编辑同志：
    我是一个革命军人，目前部队驻在新疆哈密。
    我的家在河北省清苑县（来信未写明区名、村名。——编者）。家里只有三个六十岁以上的老人，我父亲还有病；因此，家里生活很困难。我曾请我师政治部写信给清苑县人民政府，请他们了解我家的实况，并给予适当优待。政治部在一九四九年末及一九五○年连续去信四次，但是清苑县人民政府和中共清苑县委会却始终没有任何答复。
    根据我家里来信看，清苑县人民政府对我家仍没有按照实际情况给以优待。我认为，清苑县人民政府对革命军人家庭问题采取置之不理的态度是不对的。希望你们督促他们改正。
                                                   李瑞林
    编者按：如果李瑞林同志反映的情况属实，清苑县人民政府应该检查自己的工作态度和优抚工作进行的情况。
