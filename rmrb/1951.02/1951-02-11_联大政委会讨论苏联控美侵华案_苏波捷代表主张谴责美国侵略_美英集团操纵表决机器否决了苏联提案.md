Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 9th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held meetings on February 6th and 7th.

　　The February 6th meeting continued the discussion of the Soviet Union's accusation of American aggression against China. At the beginning of the meeting, Political Committee Chairman U Than Htut announced the reply telegram from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, protesting the United States' conspiracy and tricks to suddenly resume discussion of the item, preventing Chinese representatives from attending the discussion in New York. In his reply telegram, Minister Zhou Enlai requested that his reply telegram and the speech of Chinese representative Wu Hsiu-chuan, which he was unable to deliver at the Political Committee, be read at the Political Committee meeting and distributed as official documents of the United Nations. U Than Htut proposed to distribute Wu Hsiu-chuan's speech as an official document without reading it at the Political Committee meeting.

　　Polish representative Katz-Suchy emphasized the significance of this document and formally proposed that the speech should be read. Soviet representative Tsarapkin also supported Zhou Enlai's request, proposing that both documents be read and distributed.

　　Chairman U Than Htut said that merely distributing the documents would be sufficient. Katz-Suchy replied that merely distributing the documents would not be sufficient because Wu Hsiu-chuan's speech could only be included in the record of the Political Committee if it was read at the Political Committee meeting. The Ukrainian representative supported this argument, emphasizing that the US delegation's conspiracy had prevented Chinese representatives from attending the meeting.

　　However, the Political Committee adopted the chairman's ruling with 39 votes in favor and seven abstentions, meaning only to distribute Wu Hsiu-chuan's speech. Katz-Suchy said that this ruling did not preclude the possibility of reading the document. The chairman again put the question to a vote, and the Political Committee rejected the suggestion to read the document with 32 votes against six (16 abstentions).

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin spoke. He emphasized that the number of times American aircraft violated Chinese airspace and the fact that large numbers of aircraft were involved in these actions made the US's excuse that this was due to pilot "errors" untenable.

　　Tsarapkin continued that the violation of Chinese airspace and the seizure of Taiwan were two links in the same chain, proving the US's plan to expand its aggression to China. In this way, the US ruling clique was repeating the acts of aggression committed by the Japanese imperialists. Like the Japanese, the US imperialists first invaded Korea and seized Taiwan. The US was imitating the provocations of the Japanese imperialists in Northeast China, even using the same excuse as the Japanese, saying that the US provocations were "accidental incidents." This arrogant and shameless act of aggression by the United States has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people.

　　Tsarapkin then made a statement on the second item now under discussion, the accusation of the US Air Force violating Chinese airspace, bombing and strafing Chinese territory, and shelling Chinese ships. Tsarapkin began by mentioning Zhou Enlai's telegrams of August 27th and 30th, 1950, which described the US violations of Chinese territory and the killing of Chinese people, and demanded that the United Nations fulfill its responsibilities, condemn this US act of aggression, and take measures to prevent the possibility of repeating this act of aggression in the future. Tsarapkin reminded everyone that the Soviet Union had submitted the People's Republic of China's accusation to the Security Council, but the US-British bloc in the Security Council had obstructed the discussion of this accusation, preventing representatives of the People's Republic of China from participating, and obstructing the passage of the Soviet proposal that the Security Council should condemn the US act of aggression. The Soviet delegation believed that the United Nations should not ignore US aggression against China. Because in the course of this aggression, the United States blatantly violated the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits the use of force or the threat of force to undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. Therefore, the Soviet delegation put forward a proposal which cited the telegram of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, stipulating that the United Nations General Assembly condemn the illegal actions of the US government, and hold the US government fully responsible for these actions, for the losses suffered by the People's Republic of China as a result of these actions, and for any consequences that may arise. The proposal also suggested that the Security Council immediately take all necessary measures in accordance with Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter to stop the US government's actions to undermine Chinese sovereignty and cause losses to the People's Republic of China and its peaceful residents.

　　Afterwards, Nationalist Jiang Tingfu spoke, arbitrarily claiming that the Soviet accusation was unfounded.

　　Belarusian representative Svetsov then exposed the absurd statement by US representative Austin denying US aggression against China. Svetsov declared that Belarus supported the Soviet proposal calling for the Security Council to take measures to stop US aggression against China.

　　Polish representative Katz-Suchy said that the accusation made by the People's Republic of China was so righteous and forceful that the clumsy rebuttal put forward by Austin could not overturn the Chinese accusation. This issue is of great significance not only because it is related to the blatant aggression against the People's Republic of China, but also because this aggression is the first step in an attempt to restore the rule of the Nationalist clique over 475 million Chinese people and the rule of US imperialists over a quarter of the world's population. After emphasizing that this issue arose as a result of Truman's order to occupy Taiwan, Katz-Suchy listed materials proving that the decision to occupy Taiwan was made before the Korean War broke out. He recounted that in early 1950, Hoover, Taft, and others issued calls for the United States to "protect" Taiwan. At that time, Truman and Acheson replied that Taiwan was part of China. Katz-Suchy said that Austin's attempt to explain Truman and Acheson's broken promises with the Korean War was a failure, because New York Times and New York Herald Tribune reporters made it clear that the question of changing US policy towards Taiwan was a major issue discussed at the meeting held in Tokyo by MacArthur, Dulles, Johnson, and Bradley, which ended on June 25, 1950. As New York Times reporter Reston reported, even if the Korean War had not broken out, the question of changing policy towards Taiwan would have been raised to Truman.

　　Katz-Suchy said that despite the US's high-sounding claims of peaceful intentions, we must agree with MacArthur's view that the United States is trying to make Taiwan an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" that can be used for planned attacks against mainland China.

　　Katz-Suchy then pointed out that the US actions against Taiwan were taken before the Security Council made its illegal decision regarding Korea. In this way, the United States presented the Security Council with a fait accompli. The statements of Truman and Austin acknowledge that China is still in a state of civil war. Thus, the US action is a direct intervention in China's civil war with armed forces, which is a deliberate violation of the United Nations Charter.

　　Katz-Suchy then discussed the US bombing of Chinese territory. He said that Poland fully agrees with the People's Republic of China that these acts must be condemned, not only because they are barbaric and criminal, but also because if they are not condemned, these acts will encourage the US's attempt to dominate all of China. For decades, the US has been gradually moving towards this goal, but never as fanatically as now.

　　Katz-Suchy reviewed the history of US expansion in the Far East. He said that the US attitude has been exposed by the following facts: although it provided China with $1.5 billion in aid during China's eight-year war of resistance against Japan, it gave Chiang Kai-shek several times that amount in aid to fight against the people's liberation movement in the four years after Japan's surrender. These efforts on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek failed because Chiang Kai-shek did not have the support of the Chinese people. Despite its failures, the United States has not abandoned its plan to control China. These plans are part of the task that US imperialism has set for itself to destroy the national liberation movement in Asia.

　　Katz-Suchy pointed out that therefore the US is trying to support the colonial rule of Britain and France in Asia, and is trying to destroy the People's Republic of China.

　　Katz-Suchy contrasted the attitude of the United States with that of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out that the People's Republic of China, in accordance with its firm policy of peace, has made every effort to achieve a fair and rapid resolution. The People's Republic of China's action in bringing the facts of US aggression before the United Nations is a very important action for the cause of world peace. In conclusion, Katz-Suchy called on the United Nations to condemn US aggression.

　　At the morning meeting on the 7th, Czechoslovak representative Nosek said that the Czechoslovak delegation firmly rejected the US response to the Soviet accusation, believing that this response completely disregarded the nature of the problem and attempted to divert the attention of the peace-loving people of the world from the fact that the US's unwarranted aggression directly threatens the safety of the Chinese people and other peoples of Asia, thereby endangering world peace. Nosek contrasted the Soviet Union's friendly cooperation with China with the aggressive conspiracies of the ruling groups of the United States and other monopoly capitalist-controlled countries against China. Nosek said that the resolution forced through by the United States in the General Assembly is an eloquent example of its so-called "friendship" towards China. The United States insisted on passing this resolution in order to incite war against China. It was for the same purpose that the United States seized Taiwan. Nosek then explained the history of the US's attempts to monopolize the Chinese market through the combined pressure of economic power, gunboat diplomacy, and diplomacy. Nosek recounted the decisive role that US aid to Japan played in Japan's war of attempting to conquer China. He pointed out that after World War II, the United States tried to replace Japan as the main exploiter of China, and when this attempt failed, it resorted to direct military intervention. Nosek then emphasized that the United States' seizure of Taiwan abandoned solemn international agreements. This stems directly from the post-war policies of the US ruling groups. They believe that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement are already "outdated" because they hinder the US's plans to rearm Japan and West Germany in order to achieve the aggressive goals of US imperialism. In conclusion, Nosek urged the adoption of the two Soviet proposals calling on the Security Council to take action to compel the US to cease its acts of aggression against China.

　　Ukrainian representative Demchenko also similarly emphasized that the US's response to the accusations presented by Vyshinsky and Chinese representative Wu Hsiu-chuan with irrefutable facts was weak and powerless. Demchenko said that according to well-known standards of international law, it is undeniable that the United States has committed a crime of aggression, because it is invading Taiwan, it is blockading Taiwan with its navy, it is armedly interfering in China's internal affairs, and it is systematically violating Chinese airspace by bombing and strafing Chinese territory with the US Air Force. Despite US representative Austin's denial of interference in China's internal affairs, it is undeniable that the US has provided the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique with $6 billion in military aid in the past five years, and is still continuing to actively aid the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to incomplete materials, in the first nine months of 1950, the United States and Canada sent hundreds of aircraft and 700 tanks to Chiang Kai-shek. Demchenko also spoke of the military cooperation agreement between Chiang Kai-shek and MacArthur. In conclusion, Demchenko pointed out that the United Nations must take action, in accordance with the Soviet proposal, to stop US aggression against China.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin then responded to the statement made by US representative Austin on February 2nd. He pointed out that although Austin cited Truman's and the US Joint Chiefs of Staff's orders regarding Taiwan in an attempt to refute the accusation of US aggression, the specific instructions given to the US Seventh Fleet in these documents have already proven this accusation. Tsarapkin emphasized that the US plan to seize Taiwan was completed long before the Korean War. The occupation of Taiwan is an act of aggression by the United States, and it and the US aggression against Korea are two separate events, although they occurred simultaneously.

　　Tsarapkin then ridiculed the sophistry of US representative Austin, who said that MacArthur sent a mission to Taiwan to ensure the security of that region. Tsarapkin emphasized that no one gave the United States or its Far East governor MacArthur the right to defend the security of Taiwan; this right belongs only to its rightful owner - the Chinese people.

　　Tsarapkin continued that now, since US aggression threatens to expand to the whole of Asia if it is not stopped, it is even more important to stop US aggression. Tsarapkin concluded that the United Nations must fulfill its responsibilities and take steps to stop US aggression in the Far East. Therefore, the Soviet delegation insists on passing its proposals, because these proposals can fully resolve the situation arising from US aggression.

　　The chairman then announced the end of the general debate.

　　The Political Committee then rejected the Soviet proposal regarding US invasion and aggression through the naval blockade of Taiwan with five votes in favor (Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia), and 49 votes against. Three abstained (Yugoslavia, Burma, and Indonesia). The Political Committee also rejected the Soviet proposal regarding US aggression against Chinese airspace with five votes in favor (Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia) and 50 votes against. Two abstained (Yugoslavia and Afghanistan).

　　The Political Committee continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. British representative Jebb proposed at the beginning of the meeting to postpone the debate on the so-called "Formosa question" originally proposed by the United States. Jebb said that postponement was appropriate because it was impossible to reach a "firm decision" while the situation in the Far East was "unresolved."

　　US representative Austin agreed with Jebb's opinion, but emphasized that the United States wanted the item to remain on the agenda.

　　Soviet representative Tsarapkin said that the Soviet delegation opposed retaining this item, just as it opposed including the so-called "Formosa question" on the agenda, because it violated the Charter and was an insult to the Chinese people. Therefore, the Soviet delegation will vote against Jebb's proposal.

　　The Political Committee then adopted Jebb's proposal with 38 votes in favor, five votes against, and eight abstentions. The representatives of the Soviet Union and Belarus explained that they voted against it because the so-called "status of Formosa issue" did not exist and China's sovereignty over the region had been fully recognized by solemn agreements. Syrian representative El-Khouri said that he abstained because the proposal was too ambiguous.

　　The chairman of the Political Committee then proposed that the Political Committee adjourn.

　　Polish representative Katz-Suchy read out the notice issued by the United Nations Secretariat to Chinese staff members within the United Nations organization, requiring them to "must" obey the order of the US Treasury Department that all Chinese people holding more than $1,000 must report to the US Treasury Department. Katz-Suchy protested this notice, pointing out that it violated the extraterritorial rights of United Nations staff, and he questioned under whose order the Secretariat issued the above notice. Chairman U Than Htut said that he could not give an explanation, but he would notify the Secretary-General of the Polish representative's "doubts."

　　Before adjourning the Political Committee, U Than Htut said that the Political Committee would reconvene when the two committees working in accordance with the General Assembly's recent resolution on so-called Chinese "aggression" had prepared their reports.

　　联大政委会讨论苏联控美侵华案        
    苏波捷代表主张谴责美国侵略        
    美英集团操纵表决机器否决了苏联提案
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会二月六、七日举行会议。
    六日会议继续讨论苏联所提出的控诉美国侵略中国案。会议开始时，政委会主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹宣布中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来抗议美国进行阴谋诡计使政委会突然恢复讨论该项议案，以致中国代表不能前来纽约参加讨论的复电。周恩来部长在其复电中要求在政委会会议上宣读他的复电及中国代表伍修权未能在政委会发表的发言稿，并作为联合会正式文件散发。乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹提议把伍修权的发言稿作为正式文件散发，而不在政委会会议上宣读。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪着重指出这个文件的意义，并正式提议此项发言稿应予宣读。苏联代表查拉普金也支持周恩来的要求，提议宣读并散发这两个文件。
    主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹又说，仅仅散发就够了。卡茨·苏琪回答他说，仅仅散发是不够的，因为伍修权的发言稿只有在政委会会议上宣读的情况下才能被列入政委会的记录中。乌克兰代表支持这种论据，并强调指出，美国代表团的阴谋阻碍了中国代表出席会议。
    但是政委会以三十九票赞成、七票弃权通过主席的裁决，即仅仅散发伍修权的发言稿。卡茨·苏琪说，这一裁决并未使上述文件没有了宣读的可能。主席又再度把这个问题付诸表决，结果政委会以三十二票对六票（十六票弃权）否决了主张宣读这个文件的建议。
    苏联代表查拉普金发言。他着重指出，美国飞机侵犯中国领空的次数与大批飞机参与此种行动的事实，已使美国的所谓这是由于飞行员的“错误”的狡辩不能成立。
    查拉普金继称，侵犯中国领空以及强占台湾两件事乃是一条锁链上的两环，它们证明了美国企图把侵略扩大到中国的计划。这样，美国统治集团是在重演日本帝国主义者所做过的侵略行为。像日本人一样，美帝国主义者首先便入侵朝鲜并强占台湾。美国并在东北仿效着日本帝国主义的挑衅，甚至借口也和日本人一样，说什么美国的挑衅乃是“偶然事件”。美国这种横暴无耻的侵略行为已经激起中国人民的极大愤慨。
    查拉普金然后就现在同时讨论的两项议案中的第二个控诉美国空军侵犯中国领空、轰炸与扫射中国领土及炮轰中国船只案发表声明。查拉普金提到周恩来一九五○年八月二十七日和三十日的电报开始，这两封电报叙述美国侵犯中国领土和杀害中国人民的情形，并要求联合国履行其职责，谴责美国此项侵略行动，采取措施制止将来重演此项侵略行动的可能性。查拉普金提醒大家注意，苏联曾将中华人民共和国的控诉提交安全理事会，但是美英集团在安理会中曾阻挠这一控诉案的讨论，不让中华人民共和国代表参加，并阻碍通过苏联所提出的安理会应该谴责美国侵略行动的提案。苏联代表团认为，联合国不应该对美国侵略中国置之不理。因为在这种侵略的过程中，美国明目张胆地破坏了联合国宪章的基本原则，即禁止使用武力和以武力相威胁来破坏任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。因此，苏联代表团提出提案，其中引述中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的电报，规定联合国大会谴责美国政府的非法行动，并要美国政府对这些行动，对由于这些行动而使中华人民共和国遭受的损失及其可能引起的任何后果负完全责任。提案中并建议，安理会立即依据联合国宪章第十一条第二款之规定，采取一切必要的措施，来制止美国政府破坏中国主权以及使中华人民共和国和中国和平居民蒙受损失的一切非法行动。
    其后，国民党徒蒋廷黻发言，他武断地把苏联的控诉说成好像没有根据的。
    白俄罗斯代表史维佐夫接着揭露美国代表奥斯汀否认美国侵略中国的荒谬声明。史维佐夫宣称，白俄罗斯支持苏联要求安理会为制止美国侵略中国而采取措施的提案。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪发言说，中华人民共和国所提出的控诉是如此义正词严；奥斯汀所提出的那样拙劣的反驳是推翻不了中国的控诉的。这一问题之所以具有重大意义，不仅是因为它与公然侵略中华人民共和国有关，而且是因为这种侵略乃是企图恢复国民党集团对四亿七千五百万中国人民的统治，恢复美国帝国主义者对地球上四分之一居民的统治的第一步。卡茨·苏琪在着重指出这一问题是由于杜鲁门下令占领台湾的结果而产生的以后，列举材料证明占领台湾的决定是在朝鲜战争发生之前采取的。他追述道，在一九五○年初，胡佛、塔夫脱和其他的人即发出叫嚣，要美国“保护”台湾。当时杜鲁门和艾奇逊答复说台湾是中国的一部分。卡茨·苏琪说，奥斯汀企图以朝鲜战争解释杜鲁门和艾奇逊的食言是失败了，因为纽约时报和纽约先驱论坛报记者们说得很清楚，美国改变对台湾的政策问题是麦克阿瑟、杜勒斯、詹逊和布莱德雷在东京举行的会议上讨论过的大问题，而这个会议是在一九五○年六月二十五日结束，正如纽约时报记者莱斯顿所报道的，即使朝鲜战争不曾爆发，关于改变对台湾的政策的问题也会向杜鲁门提出。
    卡茨·苏琪说，尽管美国高喊具有和平的意向，我们必须同意麦克阿瑟的意见，就是美国力图使台湾成为可以用来对中国大陆进行计划中的进攻的“不沉的航空母舰”。
    卡茨·苏琪继即指出，美国对台湾的行动是在安理会作出关于朝鲜的非法决定以前采取的。这样，美国使安理会面对一个既成事实。杜鲁门和奥斯汀的声明承认，中国仍处于内战的状态。如此说来，美国的行动就是直接以武装部队干涉中国的内战，这是蓄意违反联合国宪章。
    卡茨·苏琪继而论及美国轰炸中国领土。他说，波兰充分同意中华人民共和国的意见：这些行为必须予以谴责，不但因为这些行为是野蛮的和罪恶的，并且因为如果不予以谴责，这些行为就会鼓励美国意图独霸全中国的企图。数十年来，美国一直逐步向这个目标前进，然而从来没有像现在那么狂热。
    卡茨·苏琪回顾了美国在远东的扩张活动的历史。他说，美国的态度已被下列事实揭穿：虽然它在中国八年抗日战争中给予中国十五亿元援助，然而在日本投降后四年之中，它给了蒋介石数倍于此数的援助来与人民解放运动作战。这些为蒋介石着想的努力失败了，因为蒋介石没有中国人民的支持。美国尽管失败，仍没有放弃力图控制中国的计划。这些计划是美帝国主义要摧毁亚洲民族解放运动而为自己规定的任务的一部分。
    卡茨·苏琪指出，因此美国力图支持英国与法国在亚洲的殖民地统治，并力图灭亡中华人民共和国。
    卡茨·苏琪把美国的态度与中华人民共和国的态度加以对照。他指出：中华人民共和国一直按照它的坚定的和平政策，竭尽努力以求获致公平迅速的解决。中华人民共和国把美国侵略的事实提到联合国面前来，对世界和平事业是一件很重要的行动。卡茨·苏琪在结语时要求联合国谴责美国侵略。
    七日上午会议上，捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决斥责美国对苏联控诉的回答，认为这一回答是将问题的性质完全置之不顾，并企图转移世界爱好和平的人民对于美国的无端侵略、直接威胁中国人民及亚洲其他人民的安全并从而危及世界和平这一事实的注意力。诺塞克把苏联对中国的友好合作态度与美国及其他垄断资本控制的国家的统治集团对中国的侵略阴谋加以对比。诺塞克说，美国强迫大会通过的决议是它对中国所谓“友好”的雄辩性的例证。美国坚持通过这一决议是为了煽起对中国的战争。美国正是为了同一目的夺取了台湾。诺塞克继而说明美国企图用经济力量、炮舰与外交三者的联合压力来独霸中国市场的历史。诺塞克追述美国在日本企图征服中国的战争中对日本的援助所起的决定作用。他指出，在第二次世界大战以后，美国力图代替日本而为中国的主要剥削者，而当这一企图失败时，便诉诸直接的军事干涉。诺塞克继而强调指出，美国攫取台湾，废弃了庄严的国际协定。这直接渊源于美国统治集团战后的政策。他们认为开罗宣言与波茨坦协定已经“过时”，因为这妨害美国重新武装日本与西德，以达到美帝国主义的侵略的目的计划。诺塞克在结语中敦促通过苏联所提出的要求安理会采取行动促使美国停止对中国侵略行动的两项提案。
    乌克兰代表杰姆琴科也同样强调指出：美国对于维辛斯基和中国代表伍修权以不可驳斥的事实加以说明的控诉所作答复是软弱无力。杰姆琴科说，根据大家都知道的国际法标准，无可否认，美国是犯了侵略的罪行，因为它侵略台湾，它以海军封锁台湾，武装干涉中国内政，并以美国空军轰炸与扫射中国领土来有计划地侵犯中国领空。尽管美国代表奥斯汀否认干涉中国内政，但是美国过去五年间以六十亿美元的军事援助给予破产的蒋介石集团，而且目前还在继续积极援助蒋介石集团，则是无法否认的。根据不完全的材料，在一九五○年的头九个月中，美国与加拿大曾以数百架飞机与七百辆坦克送给蒋介石。杰姆琴科还谈到蒋介石与麦克阿瑟所订的军事合作协定。杰姆琴科在结语时指出，联合国必须依照苏联所提出的提案，以行动制止美国对中国侵略。
    苏联代表查拉普金继而答复美国代表奥斯汀在二月二日所作的声明。他指出，虽然奥斯汀引述了杜鲁门和美国联合参谋总部关于台湾的命令，试图反驳对美国侵略的控诉，但是，这些文件中给予美国第七舰队的具体指令，已经证明了这个控诉。查拉普金着重指出：美国攫取台湾的计划是在朝鲜战争很久以前就已完成了的。占领台湾是美国的一个侵略行动，它与美国侵略朝鲜是两件事，虽然是同时进行的。
    查拉普金继而讥讽美国代表奥斯汀的诡辩，奥斯汀说麦克阿瑟派遣使团到台湾去是为了保证那个区域的安全。查拉普金强调指出，并没有人给美国或其远东总督麦克阿瑟以保卫台湾安全的权利，这种权利只属于其合法的所有者——中国人民。
    查拉普金继称，现在，由于美国的侵略若不加制止就有扩大到整个亚洲之势，所以制止美国的侵略更加重要。查拉普金结语时称，联合国必须尽其职责，采取步骤，以制止美国在远东的侵略。因此，苏联代表团坚持通过它的提案，因为这些提案可以充分解决由于美国侵略而产生的局势。
    主席至此宣布一般辩论结束。
    政委会于是以五票（苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克）赞成、四十九票反对，否决了苏联所提出的关于美国侵入并以海军封锁台湾而实行侵略的提案。三票弃权（南斯拉夫、缅甸与印尼）。政委会又以五票（苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克）赞成、五十票反对，否决了苏联所提出的关于美国侵略中国领空的提案。二票弃权（南斯拉夫与阿富汗）。
    政委会在七日下午继续举行会议。英国代表杰伯在会议开始时提议延期辩论原来由美国提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”。杰伯说，由于在远东局势“未获解决”时不可能得出“坚定的决定”，所以延期是适宜的。
    美国代表奥斯汀同意杰伯的意见，但是强调说，美国要这个议案保留在议程上。
    苏联代表查拉普金说，苏联代表团反对保留这一议案，正如反对把所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程一样，因为它违反宪章并且是对中国人民的侮辱。因此，苏联代表团将投票反对杰伯的提议。
    政委会接着以三十八票对五票及八票弃权通过杰伯的提议。苏联和白俄罗斯代表解释说，他们所以投票反对，是由于所谓“福摩萨地位问题”并不存在，中国对该地区的主权已为庄严的协定所充分承认。叙利亚代表埃尔——古里说，他弃权是因为这个提议太含糊。
    政委会主席继即提议政委会休会。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪宣读了联合国秘书处向联合国组织内中国籍职员所发布的通告，要他们“必须”服从美国财政部关于所有持有一千美元以上的中国人应向美国财政部报告的命令。卡茨·苏琪抗议这个通告，指出它违反联合国职员的治外法权，他并质问秘书处根据谁的命令发布上述通告。主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹说，他不能够予以解释，但他将把波兰代表的“怀疑”通知秘书长。
    乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹在政委会休会前说，当按照大会最近关于所谓中国“侵略”的决议而工作的两个委员会准备好它们的报告时，政委会将再行开会。
