Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Reply from the Daming Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    To the Editor:
    Following the criticism in the People's Daily on January 25th regarding our county's Supply and Marketing Cooperative's straw braid factory, we immediately conducted a thorough review from top to bottom.

    The establishment of this factory was originally intended for two purposes: (1) Weaving straw braids is a major sideline production for farmers in our county during the spring and winter seasons. After the Japanese invasion, the sales of straw braids stagnated. Therefore, opening up the market for straw braids is a universal demand of the farmers. (2) In July 1949, Daming suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, and locusts, making life very difficult for the farmers, especially in the Daming urban area where the factory was located, where people's livelihoods were even more insecure. It was under these circumstances that the county's Supply and Marketing Cooperative opened the straw braid factory to help the masses overcome the famine. However, in September 1950, following a notice from the higher-level cooperative, we began to handle all shutdown matters. At that time, because some inventory had not yet been sold, it was only formally shut down in January of this year. We are now planning to transfer the factory's business to the local native products company for operation.

    If there is anything inappropriate in the above response, we hope that you will continue to send letters of correction to improve our work and policy level.
                  Daming County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei Province

### 大名供销社的答复

　　大名供销社的答复
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月二十五日对我县供销社草帽辫工厂提出批评后，我们即从上到下的作了检查。
    当时建立该厂有两个意图：（一）编织草帽辫为我县农民春冬两季的主要副业生产。日寇入侵后，草帽辫销路即行停滞，因此现在打开草帽辫的销路是农民的普遍要求。（二）一九四九年七月该场建立时，大名遭受水、旱、蝗虫等灾害，农民生活十分困难，特别是该厂所在的大名城关区，人民生活更无保证。就在这种情况下，县供销社开办了草帽辫工厂，以协助群众度荒。但在一九五○年九月间，我们根据上级社的通知即着手办理一切停工事宜；当时因为有些存货尚未售出，所以到今年一月才正式停办。现在我们正在计划把该厂业务移交当地土产公司负责经营。
    以上答复如有不妥当的地方，希继续来信指正，以利提高我们的工作与政策水平。
              河北省大名县供销社
