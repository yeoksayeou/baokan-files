　　Ordinary People
　　Ding Fan, Dai Qingyu
　　Airplanes were circling overhead, and Lao Xie and I sat in the room, not moving, talking; I was completely captivated by the story he was telling...

　　The story is as follows: One night last November, it was very dark, and you couldn't see anyone across from you, only the stars in the sky were twinkling. The car was moving forward on the snowy road, stopping every once in a while after driving for a bit to turn off the headlights and listen for enemy planes. Some of the wounded soldiers in the car were already asleep, and some were gritting their teeth, enduring the pain of their wounds and the invasion of the cold wind, but no one complained.

　　Comrade Wei Guohua, who was responsible for taking care of the wounded soldiers, hadn't had a good rest for several nights. To reduce the suffering of the wounded during transportation, he tried everything to care for and comfort them: finding warm rooms, boiling hot water. Some seriously wounded soldiers couldn't move, so he had to personally feed them and help them with their bowel movements. He was as caring as an old mother, but he was just a young man in his twenties.

　　Since accepting this task, Wei Guohua had been especially careful because the road was long, there were many wounded soldiers, few people to help, and enemy planes were very active. Although planes had buzzed overhead several times in the first half of the night, nothing had gone wrong, but he was always on alert. He looked at his watch, it was already past two o'clock. Usually, he would have stopped the car by this time, but today he still had to travel a long distance. The wheels crunched forward on the snow, and the snoring of the wounded soldiers came from beside him from time to time. He didn't dare to doze off, constantly rubbing his bloodshot eyes with his hands, taking deep breaths of cold air, and moisturizing his tired throat to cheer himself up.

　　Suddenly, the car in front stopped. It turned out that a river was blocking the way. The bridge was very narrow, and the car couldn't pass. They had to go through the water. But the ice in the river had been broken by the passing cars, and it would be very dangerous if the car carried people through the water. Everyone had to get off and cross the bridge before getting back in the car. Comrade Wei Guohua personally inspected the bridge. It was dark, and there were only two pieces of wood lying across it, completely covered with ice. It was slippery to step on, and it was very dangerous to carry the wounded soldiers across the bridge. The river water was gurgling under the bridge, and the starlight was reflected on the icy river, appearing cold and eerie. But seeing that it was almost dawn and there was no place to hide the cars, they would suffer even greater losses if they encountered enemy planes. To save the wounded soldiers, they had to get across no matter what. Thinking of this, he took off his cotton shoes without hesitation, rolled up his trouser legs, and called on everyone, saying: "Comrades, the time to earn merit has come. Communist Party members must set an example." Then he carried a seriously wounded soldier on his back and waded across the swift icy river.

　　In the deep night of November, the river water was so cold! The ice on the riverbank and the snow on the shore were like sharp knives stabbing into his skin. When the water splashed on his trouser legs, it immediately froze into small ice cubes. His legs were already numb, but to save the wounded soldiers, he forgot everything, his heart burning with ardent class feelings and a fiery fighting will, crossing the icy river again and again…

　　In this way, our hero Comrade Wei Guohua was not only not intimidated by difficulties, but on the contrary, inspired by his great spirit of self-sacrifice and courageous and heroic actions, the lightly wounded soldiers were all moved to tears and insisted on slowly climbing across the bridge. And other working comrades also took off their shoes and started to act one after another, and as a result, they quickly carried more than forty wounded and sick soldiers across the river.

　　……………………

　　Another time, it was when transferring the wounded and sick soldiers from Xichuan to the rear by train. During the day, when hiding in a certain cave, because the cave was small and there were many people, plus the coal smoke from the train filled the cave and couldn't get out, a soldier was suffocated by the coal smoke in his sleep. After Comrade Wei Guohua discovered this, he immediately ran over, carried him out of the thick black smoke, placed him in a cool place, and hurriedly revived him with cold water, allowing him to gradually regain consciousness. But then he found that there were five other people in the cave who had also been smoked unconscious. Comrade Wei Guohua immediately stood up, disregarding his fatigue, took the lead, and mobilized several people to go into the cave to rescue them together. After finding them, seeing that their breathing was about to stop, they hurriedly carried them outside to rescue them with cold water. After more than two hours, they slowly woke up. At this time, Comrade Wei Guohua, due to entering and exiting the cave twice, was also dizzy from the smoke and very tired. He was just about to rest when he suddenly found that more than twenty of the wounded soldiers he was escorting had also been smoked unconscious on the train. He disregarded everything, wiped the tears that had been choked out by the smoke, endured the dizziness, and ran quickly into the cave with staggering steps. Other comrades also ran in with him, going back and forth several times, rescuing the people, and the rescuers themselves were also poisoned. Comrade Wei Guohua insisted on encouraging everyone, saying:

　　"Comrades, we must now do everything for the wounded and sick soldiers who have shed blood for us! We can't just watch them sacrifice themselves!" He dipped the towels in water and handed them to everyone to wrap around their mouths in preparation for mutual rescue, and then rushed into the cave to rescue them. One, two, three... more than twenty wounded soldiers were completely rescued by them, and emergency methods were used to get all personnel out of danger. But at this time, Comrade Wei Guohua fainted due to poisoning. The rescued wounded soldiers hurriedly surrounded him to take care of him and said with emotion and tears: "If it weren't for Comrade Wei, we would have all been suffocated to death." But the rescued Wei Guohua smiled as he lay on the ground and said: "This is my responsibility, I should do this. If it weren't for everyone's help, I wouldn't have been able to do it myself." From his hoarse voice that had been choked by the smoke, he revealed joy, revealed victory, revealed a strong force that could never be conquered by any difficulty - the Bolshevik's fighting tenacity.

    飞机在头顶上不断地盘旋，老谢和我坐在屋子里一动不动地在谈着；我完全被他所讲的故事吸引住了……。
    事情是这样的，去年十一月某日的夜里，天很黑，对面不见人，只有天上的星星眨着眼。汽车在雪路上前进着，走一会儿就闭上车灯停一下，听听是否有敌机。车上的伤员有的已经睡着了，有的在咬着牙忍耐着伤口的疼痛及寒风的侵袭，可是却没有一个人叫苦。
    负责照顾伤员的魏国华同志，已经有好几宿没有好好休息了。为了使伤员在转运途中减少痛苦，他想尽了一切办法来照护和安慰他们：找暖房、烧热水，有的重伤员不能动，要他亲自去喂饭，还要帮助接大小便。每到一个地方，必须先把伤员安置好，自己才放心，问饱问暖的简直像个老妈妈，其实他只是一个二十多岁的青年小伙子。
    魏国华自从接受这次任务以来，自己特别小心，因为路远，伤员多，人手少，加上敌机活动的又厉害，虽然上半夜飞机在头上嗡嗡了好几次，没有出什么错，可是自己总是在警惕着。他看了一下手表，已经两点多了。往常这时候已经收车了，但今天还要赶一段路。车轮子压在雪地上刷刷地前进着，伤员的鼾睡声不时从身旁传过来。他不敢打盹，不断用手揉擦着熬红了的眼睛，深深地吸着冷空气，冰润一下累干了的嗓子，以振奋一下精神。
    突然，前面的车子停住了，原来是一条河挡住了去路。桥很窄，车子过不去，必须从水里走。可是河里的冰已经被来往的车子压坏了，如果车要载着人从水里过，那是很危险的。大家只好下来从桥上过去再坐车。魏国华同志亲自看了一下桥，黑呼呼地只有两根木头横在那儿，上边全冻上冰，一踩溜滑，背着伤员过桥是十分危险的。桥下河水哗哗地流着，星光倒映在冰河上，显得冷气森森逼人。但眼看着天快要亮了，车子又没有隐蔽的地方，要是碰上敌机一定会遭受更大损失。为了救护伤员，无论怎样也得过去。他想到这儿，便毫不犹疑地脱下自己的棉鞋，卷起裤腿，并号召大家说：“同志们，争取立功的时候到了，共产党员要以身作则。”接着他就背起重伤员从急流的冰河上趟过去。
    在十一月天的深夜里，河水是多么冷啊，河沿上的冰，岸上的雪，简直像尖刀似的刺进了他的皮肤里。水溅到裤腿上，立刻冻成小冰块儿。他的两条腿已经麻木了，可是为了救护伤员，他忘掉了一切，心里燃烧着炽烈的阶级感情和火热的斗争意志，一次又一次的从冰河上走过去、又趟过来……。
    就这样，我们的英雄魏国华同志不仅没有叫困难吓倒，相反的在他伟大的自我牺牲精神和果敢英勇的行动感召下，轻伤员都感动得一面流着眼泪一面坚持着慢慢从桥上爬过去。而其他工作同志也都相继脱下了鞋子行动起来，结果很快的把四十多个伤病员背过河去。
    ……………………
    又一次，那是从熙川坐火车往后面转送伤病员。白天在某山洞里躲避时，因为洞小人多，加上火车煤烟充满山洞里出不来，结果一个战士在睡梦中被煤烟熏昏过去了。魏国华同志发现后，立刻跑过去，从浓浓的黑烟里把他背出来，放在清凉地方，忙以冷水复面施行急救，使他渐渐清醒过来。可是这时他又发现洞里还有五个人也都被烟熏过去了。魏国华同志马上站起来，不顾疲累，带着头，并动员了几个人，一起跑到洞里去救护。找到以后，眼看着他们呼吸就要断绝了，忙背到外面用凉水急救。经过两个多钟头，他们才慢慢醒过来。这时魏国华同志由于两次出入山洞，也被烟熏得发昏，身体也很疲乏，正想休息。忽然发现自己护送的伤员有二十多名也在火车上被烟熏过去了。他便不顾一切的擦了一下被烟呛出来的眼泪，忍着头昏，迈着踉跄的步子飞快跑进山洞去，其他同志也随他跑进去，一连往返几次，救护的人自己也都中了毒，魏国华同志坚持鼓励大家说：
    “同志们，我们现在要一切为了曾为我们流过血的伤病员；不能眼看着他们牺牲啊！”并把手巾沾上水交给大伙儿包在嘴上，以备互相救治，又忙钻进山洞里去救护。一个、两个、三个……二十多个伤员完全被他们抢救了出来，并用急救方法使全部人员脱险。可是这时，魏国华同志却因为中毒而昏倒了。被救醒的伤员忙围上去照护他，并感动的流着眼泪说：“要不是魏同志，我们早就都熏死了。”但是被救醒的魏国华同志却躺在地上微笑着说：“这是我的责任，我应该这样。要不是大家动手，我自己也不行呵。”从他那已经被呛得嘶哑的声音里，露出了愉快，露出了胜利，露出了永远不能被任何困难所征服的坚强力量——布尔什维克的战斗的顽强性。  一九五一、二、四
