　　A Powerful Alliance
　　A. Maresiev
    Editor's Note: The author of this article, A. Maresiev, is a world-renowned Soviet pilot who was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The Soviet novel "The Real Man" and the film "Steel Will" (also known as "The Legless Flying General") describe his heroic achievements.

    It has been a year since the signing of the historic Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
    During this year, the friendship between our two great nations has become even stronger, and this friendship has become a powerful force in the struggle for world peace.
    From the Danube to the shores of the Pacific, from the Arctic Ocean to the South China Sea, our two great nations—the Soviet nation and the Chinese nation—stand shoulder to shoulder like brothers to defend peace. No force can shake this powerful alliance!
    Dear Chinese friends! We Soviet people are watching the victories of your country with great love and attention. I remember how the Soviet delegates at the Second World Peace Congress listened with great joy to the Chinese comrades' reports on the peaceful construction work of the people in building a new democratic China. We also learned of your anxiety about the fate of your revitalized motherland, because its security is being threatened by American imperialists. Truman and MacArthur's attempts to enslave your people are the same as what Hitler once tried to do to the Soviet people. But their estimations will fail just as the estimations of the German fascists and Japanese aggressors failed. People who fight for justice, for the freedom and independence of their own country, are invincible!
    I wept with joy at the victorious battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, who are fighting and shedding blood against the foreign invaders who invaded the fraternal Korean people and threatened China's security. I understand the heroism of your soldiers. When the Hitlerite bandits surged into our country, the Soviet people also spared no effort to defend the independence of their socialist motherland.
    In the early days of the Great Patriotic War, I lost both legs. But could I quietly rest and wait for others to end the war? I couldn't do that while there were still fascist bandits on my land. With great willpower, I forced myself to learn to use artificial legs and got back into the cockpit of a fighter plane. After that, I shot down eleven fascist planes, for which the Soviet government awarded me the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
    When you feel love for your people, for your country, and extreme hatred for the enemy, you will not hesitate to give your life. Tens of thousands of soldiers and officers in our glorious army have become heroes because they love their people and hate the enemies of their country.
    The Chinese people have finally stood tall. We Soviet people firmly believe that the Chinese people will never again allow anyone to destroy their peaceful cities and villages with impunity, and will never again allow anyone to disrupt the happy creative labor of hundreds of millions of free people.
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, I sincerely wish you—Chinese friends—every success in building a new democratic China.

　　强大的联盟
　　Ａ·马列西也夫
    编者按：本文作者Ａ·马列西也夫是举世闻名的苏联飞行员，曾荣获苏联英雄的称号，苏联小说《真正的人》和影片《钢铁意志》（“又名无脚飞将军”），即是描述他的英勇业绩的。                   
    自从苏联与中华人民共和国两大国家之间签订友好、同盟、互助条约这一历史性的日子起，已经一年过去了。
    在这一年中间，我们两大民族之间的友谊是更为巩固了，而这个友谊，在争取全世界和平的斗争中已成为强大的力量了。
    从多脑河到太平洋岸，从北冰洋到南中国海，我们两大民族——苏维埃民族和中华民族，像亲兄弟般的肩并肩地起来保卫了和平，任何力量都不能摇撼这个强大的联盟！
    亲爱的中国朋友们！我们苏维埃人都以极大的热爱和注意，瞩望着贵国的胜利。我记得，在第二届世界和平大会上，苏联代表们是如何兴高彩烈地倾听了中国同志们关于你们建设新民主主义中国的人民的和平建设劳动。我们同时也了解到你们对于自己复兴的祖国命运的焦虑，因为她的安全正受着美国帝国主义者的威胁。杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟妄想奴役你们人民，这是和希特勒曾对苏联人民所试图过的作为是一样的。但是，他们的估计会像德国法西斯及日本侵略者的估计一样地落空的。为了正义事业、为了自己祖国的自由和独立而战斗的人民是不可战胜的！
    在和进犯兄弟般的朝鲜人民并威胁着中国安全的外国强盗们进行斗争而不惜牺牲流血的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的战斗胜利，使我狂欢得流泪。我是了解你们战士们的英雄气概的。当希特勒匪帮汹涌地涌进我国时，苏联人民在维护自己社会主义祖国的独立而进行斗争时，也曾毫不吝惜自己的生命。
    在卫国战争的初期，我曾失去了两腿。但我能去静静地休养并等待别人来结束这个战争吗？当我的土地上还有着法西斯强盗的时候，我是做不到这一点的。我以极大的意志上的努力，强迫自己学会了运用假脚，而再度坐上了驱逐机的驾驶台。此后，我曾击落了十一架法西斯飞机，为了这个，苏维埃政府以苏联英雄的称号授给了我。
    当你对于自己的人民、对于自己的祖国感觉到热爱，而对于敌人感觉到极端痛恨的时候，你就不会怜惜献出自己的生命。我们光荣军队中数万士兵军官都已成了英雄，因为他们热爱自己人民和痛恨自己祖国的敌人。
    中国人民终于挺起了胸膛。我们苏维埃人民坚决相信：中国人民是永远不会再允许任何人来破坏自己的和平城市及乡村而不受处罚，不会再允许任何人来扰乱亿万自由人民的快乐的创造性劳动的。
    值兹友好条约签订一周年之际，我衷心希望你们——中国朋友们——在建设新民主主义中国中的一切成就。
