　　 I. U.S. Imperialism is Intensifying the Rearmament of Japan

    U.S. President Truman recently sent his special representative, Dulles, to Japan to conduct activities for a separate peace treaty with Japan, the purpose of which is to rearm Japan on a large scale.

    In the memorandum on the Japanese peace treaty submitted by U.S. State Department Advisor Dulles to Soviet Representative to the Security Council Malik on October 26 last year, the U.S. government stated: "Japan's equipment and the U.S. or other armies have a continuing responsibility to cooperate in maintaining international peace and security in the Japanese region." In a further memorandum from the U.S. government to the Soviet government on December 28 regarding the Japanese peace treaty, it was even more bluntly stated: "Japan should participate with the United States and other countries in individual and collective defense measures as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, particularly Article 51." This means that Japan is to become a tool of U.S. aggression, its territory a U.S. base of aggression, its people U.S. cannon fodder, and all its equipment used for U.S. aggressive wars.

    U.S. occupation commander in Japan, MacArthur, openly advocated revising the provision in the Japanese Constitution that renounces war in his New Year's "Message to the Japanese People." MacArthur accused the provision in the Japanese Constitution that "renounces war as an instrument of national policy" as being "overly cautious" and wanted the Japanese people to replace the principle of "renouncing war" with the "irresistible law of self-preservation" and the principle of "gathering strength to repel violence." The so-called "law of self-preservation" and "gathering strength" are actually aimed at restoring Japan's militarist power.

    In fact, the United States has already begun to arm Japan. Under MacArthur's orders, Japan has established a police force of 125,000 and a "police reserve force" of 75,000. The so-called "police reserve force" is actually a disguised organization of the new Japanese army. A January 14 dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Tokyo also stated: "These 75,000 reserve police are, in reality, the military backbone of the future Japanese armed forces. In terms of organization and training, they are soldiers, not police." In addition, the Japanese navy is also being rebuilt under the name of the "Maritime Safety Agency," and Japanese air force personnel are also being trained by the United States.

    However, because the United States has failed in its war of aggression against Korea and its weakness of insufficient military strength has become more exposed, it feels that arming Japan secretly and partially in this way can no longer meet the needs of its war of aggression. Therefore, it wants to rearm Japan on an even larger scale.

            II. We Must Resolutely Oppose the U.S. Rearmament of Japan

    Rearming Japan is an important preparatory step by U.S. imperialism in preparing to expand its war of aggression. Many U.S. war-mongers and reactionary newspapers have openly stated that in order to launch a new and larger-scale war, attack China, the Soviet Union, and other countries, and dominate the world, it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of the United States. In the West, West Germany must be armed, and in the East, Japan must be armed, to serve as the United States' reliance in future wars. Therefore, the U.S. action of rearming Japan seriously threatens China's security and peace in the Far East.

    The U.S. rearmament of Japan, with China as its primary target of aggression in the East, is a complete violation of the interests of the Chinese people. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japanese imperialism has been invading China. It is the Chinese people's most important and most ferocious enemy. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, Japanese imperialism occupied our country's Northeast provinces. In particular, after the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a large-scale armed invasion of China, causing unprecedented catastrophe to our country. Vast territories were ravaged by Japanese invaders, tens of millions of compatriots died under the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, and hundreds of cities and tens of thousands of villages were burned by the Japanese invaders. More than ten million people across the country, mainly the old, weak, women, and children, as well as young and strong men who were captured, died. The loss of public and private property throughout the country totaled approximately 50 billion U.S. dollars. The Chinese people, after eight years of heroic resistance, and at the cost of countless bloodshed and sacrifices, finally defeated Japanese imperialism and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now the United States wants to rearm Japan, support the revival of Japanese militarism, and invade China together. This is naturally absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    The U.S. rearmament of Japan, making Japan a tool of aggression, is also contrary to the interests of the vast majority of the Japanese people. Because the United States is turning Japan into a U.S. colony, using Japanese people as cannon fodder. The result of the U.S. doing this will be to keep Japan in a long-term state of hostility with the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, push Japan onto the path of war, and prevent the Japanese people from living a peaceful life. It will also cause Japan to lose the opportunity to develop peaceful trade with China and other Asian countries, cut off the raw materials for Japan's industrial production, deprive its products of markets, and prevent its peaceful economy from ever recovering. In this way, the lives of the Japanese people will become more and more difficult. The Japanese imperialists' own past experience has already proven that the path of aggression is impassable. U.S. imperialism is now suffering defeat in its war of aggression against Korea. If Japan obeys the United States, it will sink deeper and deeper into becoming an inextricable U.S. colony, eventually leading to its own destruction.

    The U.S. rearmament of Japan also harms the interests of the people of other Asian countries and Australia. Most Asian countries have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression. Korea suffered under Japanese slavery for more than 50 years. During World War II, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaya were all ravaged by Japanese imperialism, and India, Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand were also threatened by Japanese imperialism. If Japan is rearmed, the people of Asian countries will be in danger of suffering new disasters again. The people of Asian countries have fresh memories of the bloody crimes of Japanese imperialism and certainly cannot allow the United States to revive the forces of Japanese militarism.

    The U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan are illegal acts that completely violate international agreements and the Japanese Constitution. The "Declaration by United Nations," signed in 1942 by 26 countries including Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, stipulated: "Each government undertakes to cooperate with the governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies." The Potsdam Conference in July 1945 and the Moscow Conference in December of the same year stipulated the principle that the preparation of a peace treaty with enemy countries must be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the major powers. The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that Japan must be completely disarmed. The decision passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947, clearly stipulated that Japan must not possess land, sea, or air forces. Chapter II of the new Japanese Constitution promulgated in November 1946 and implemented in May 1947 (titled "Renunciation of War") also clearly stipulated in Article 9: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized." China is the country with the closest relationship with Japan and the one that fought the longest and made the greatest sacrifices in the war against Japan. The Soviet Union is the decisive force that finally defeated Japan. The United States is now tearing up international agreements, violating the Japanese Constitution, setting aside China and the Soviet Union, and attempting to make a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan, uniting with yesterday's enemy to carry out aggression. This is, of course, not permitted by the people of China and the Soviet Union.

            III. How to Launch a Struggle Against the U.S. Armament of Japan?

    The people of the whole country should immediately launch a strong mass movement against the U.S. rearmament of Japan and strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. This movement is part of the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and should be carried out in conjunction with the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. People in all regions can express their firm will to oppose the U.S. armament of Japan by holding rallies, parades, and issuing declarations; and they can also hold accusation meetings to accuse Japanese imperialism of its crimes of aggression against China. Newspapers and radio stations in various regions should systematically conduct propaganda against the U.S. armament of Japan, and at the same time, they should expose the facts that U.S. imperialism has consistently helped Japan to invade China in the past. Propaganda organs in various regions should compile popular propaganda materials against the U.S. armament of Japan for propagandists to use to propagandize among the masses.

    We should unite with the Japanese people to jointly oppose the U.S. conspiracy to rearm Japan. People in all regions can write letters and send telegrams to Japanese social organizations, Japanese political parties, the Japanese parliament, and Japanese newspapers in an organized manner, telling them that the interests of the Chinese people and the Japanese people are consistent. The U.S. rearmament of Japan is very harmful to the Japanese people. The only way for the Japanese people to save themselves today is to oppose the U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan, strive for a comprehensive and just peace treaty, maintain friendly relations with the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, and seek a peaceful and democratic Japan. The Japanese people should unite with the people of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries to oppose the Yoshida reactionary government's collusion with U.S. imperialism to sell out Japanese interests, force the Japanese people to act as U.S. cannon fodder, and turn Japan into a base for wars of aggression. The United States cannot and will not help the Japanese people. Today, it is China that can help the Japanese people. If the Japanese reactionary government dares to accept the U.S. rearmament plan, then Japan will inevitably be driven to a dead end because of Chinese resistance and opposition. At the same time, people in all regions can also send telegrams and write letters to the Far Eastern Commission, MacArthur, and the Japanese Yoshida government, protesting the U.S.'s sinister conspiracy to violate international agreements. In the letters and telegrams to MacArthur and the Yoshida government, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries should be warned that if they make a separate peace treaty, setting aside China and the Soviet Union, and lead Japan onto the path of armament and war, they will bear all the consequences.

    We should unite with the people of other Asian countries to jointly oppose the U.S. conspiracy to rearm Japan. People in all regions can send circular telegrams and write letters to the people of Asian countries (telegrams and letters to Japan and other Asian countries should be carried out in an organized manner by people's organizations), explaining that the Chinese people share weal and woe with the people of Asian countries and that their interests are consistent. Opposing the U.S. rearmament of Japan is the most important thing for the people of Asia at present. This is not only related to China's security, but also to peace in Asia and to the vital interests of the people of all Asian countries. Therefore, the people of all peace-loving Asian countries should actively participate in this struggle.

　　在全国展开反对美国重新武装日本的斗争
    王宗一
            一  美帝国主义正在加紧重新武装日本
    美国总统杜鲁门最近派了他的特别代表杜勒斯到日本，进行片面对日媾和的活动，其目的是要大规模地重新武装日本。
    去年十月二十六日美国务院顾问杜勒斯递交苏联驻安理会代表马立克的美国政府关于对日和约的备忘录中曾说：“日本的设备与美国的或其他军队之间有继续合作以维持日本地区的国际和平与安全的责任。”十二月二十八日美国政府致苏联政府的又一关于对日和约的备忘录中更露骨地说：“日本理应和美国及其他国家一道参加联合国宪章特别是第五十一条所规定的个别和集体防御措置。”这就是说，日本要成为美国的侵略工具，它的国土变成美国的侵略基地，它的人民充当美国的炮灰，它的一切设备都要为美国侵略战争之用。
    美国驻日占领军司令麦克阿瑟曾在他的新年“致日本人民书”中公开鼓吹修改日本宪法中废弃战争的规定。麦克阿瑟指责日本宪法中“废弃以战争作为推行国策的工具”的规定是“过于审慎”，而要日本人民以“不可抵抗的自保的法则”和“聚集力量以击退暴力”的原则去代替“废弃战争”的原则。所谓“自保法则”和“聚集力量”，实际上就是要恢复日本的军国主义力量。
    事实上，美国早已在开始武装日本。在麦克阿瑟命令下，日本已建立起十二万五千名警察部队和七万五千名的“警察后备队”。所谓“警察后备队”实际上就是日本新陆军的变相组织。匪中央社东京一月十四日电也说：“这七万五千名的后备警察实在说来便是未来日本武装部队的军事骨干，无论在组织方面或在训练方面他们都是军人而不是警察。”此外，日本的海军也在“海上保安厅”的名义下重建中，日本的空军人员也在由美国加以训练。
    但是美国现在因为侵略朝鲜战争失败，兵力不足的弱点更加暴露，感到这样偷偷摸摸地、部分地武装日本，已经不能满足侵略战争的需要，所以它想更大规模地重新武装日本。
            二  我们必须坚决反对美国重新武装日本
    重新武装日本，是美帝国主义准备扩大侵略战争的一个重要准备步骤。美国许多战争贩子和反动报纸曾经公开地说过，要发动新的更大规模的战争，进攻中国、苏联和其他国家，独霸全世界，光靠美国的力量是不行的，在西方必须武装西德，在东方必须武装日本，以作为美国在未来战争中的依靠。所以美国重新武装日本的行动严重地威胁着中国的安全与远东的和平。
    美国重新武装日本，以中国作为在东方的首要的侵略对象，是完全违反中国人民的利益的。自一八九四年甲午战争以来，日本帝国主义一直侵略中国，它是中国人民最主要最凶恶的敌人。一九三一年“九一八”事变以后，日本帝国主义侵占了我国的东北数省。特别是一九三七年“七七”事变以后，日本帝国主义更对中国实行了大规模的武装侵略，使我国遭受空前浩劫，广大的国土被日寇蹂躏，成千万同胞死于日寇的铁蹄之下，成百个城市成万个乡村被日寇焚毁。全国人民，主要是老弱妇孺和被抓去的青年壮丁死亡在一千万人以上，全国公私财产损失共约五百亿美元。中国人民经过了八年英勇抗战，花了无数流血牺牲的代价，才打败了日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的胜利。现在美国要重新武装日本，扶植日本军国主义复活，一同来侵略中国，这自然是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    美国重新武装日本，使日本成为侵略工具，也是违背日本绝大多数人民利益的。因为美国是把日本变为美国的殖民地，利用日本人作炮灰。美国这样作的结果，会使日本与中苏两大国继续长期地处于敌对状态，把日本推上战争的道路，使日本人民不能过和平的生活。它还会使日本丧失与中国及其他亚洲国家发展和平贸易的机会，使日本的工业生产的原料断绝，产品没有市场，和平经济永远不能恢复，这样，日本人民的生活一天比一天更加恶劣。日本帝国主义自己过去的经验，已经证明了侵略的路是走不通的。美帝国主义现在在侵略朝鲜的战争中也遭受了失败。日本如果听从美国摆布，将使自己愈陷愈深地沦为难以解脱的美国殖民地，最后使自己毁灭。
    美国重新武装日本，也是危害亚洲其他国家和澳洲人民的利益的。亚洲大多数国家都曾遭受过日本帝国主义的侵略。朝鲜遭受日本的奴役达五十多年之久。在第二次世界大战中，越南、缅甸、印尼、泰国、菲律宾和马来亚都遭受过日本帝国主义的蹂躏，印度、锡兰、澳洲和纽西兰也受到日本帝国主义的威胁。如果日本被再武装起来，亚洲各国人民就有再遭受新的灾祸的危险。亚洲各国人民对于日本帝国主义血迹斑斑的罪行记忆犹新，当然不能允许美国再来复活日本的军国主义势力。
    美国片面对日媾和，重新武装日本，是完全违背国际协议和日本宪法的非法行为。一九四二年由英、美、中、苏等二十六个国家签署的“反法西斯联合宣言”曾规定：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定或和约。”一九四五年七月波茨坦会议及同年十二月莫斯科会议又规定了对敌国媾和必须由大国外长会议准备的原则。波茨坦公告规定了必须完全解除日本武装。一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会通过的决定又明确规定日本不得保有陆、海、空军。一九四六年十一月公布一九四七年五月开始实施之日本新宪法第二章（该章题名《放弃战争》）第九条也曾明白规定：“日本国民诚实希望以正义与秩序为基调之国际和平，所谓国权发动之战争与武力之威吓及行使，永久予以放弃，不作为解决国际纷争之手段。为达到前项目的计，不保持陆海空军及其他战力，不承认国家之交战权。”中国是与日本关系最密切并且是对日作战最久、牺牲最大的国家，苏联是最后击败日本的决定力量。美国现在竟来撕毁国际协议，违反日本宪法，撇开中苏两国，想片面对日媾和，重新武装日本，联合昨日的敌国进行侵略，当然是中苏两国人民所不能允许的。
            三  怎样展开反对美国武装日本的斗争？
    全国人民应该立即展开一个反对美国重新武装日本、争取全面对日和约的强有力的群众运动。这一运动是抗美援朝运动的一部分，应该和抗美援朝运动结合起来进行。各地人民可用举行集会、游行、发表宣言等办法来表示反对美国武装日本的坚强意志；并可举行控诉会，控诉日本帝国主义侵略中国的罪行。各地报纸、广播电台应有系统地进行反对美国武装日本的宣传，同时并应揭露美帝国主义过去一贯助日侵华的事实。各地宣传机关应编写一些反对美国武装日本的通俗宣传材料，供宣传员向人民群众作宣传之用。
    应该联合日本人民共同反对美国重新武装日本的阴谋。各地人民可以有组织地向日本社会团体、日本政党、日本议会、日本报纸写信，打电报，告诉他们：中国人民与日本人民的利益是一致的。美国重新武装日本对日本人民有很大的危害性，今天日本人民唯一自救的道路，就是反对美国片面对日媾和和重新武装日本，争取全面的公正的和约，与中苏两大国家保持友善关系，谋求一个和平民主的日本。日本人民应该与中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民联合起来，反对吉田反动政府与美国帝国主义勾结，出卖日本利益，强迫日本人民充当美国炮灰，把日本变成侵略战争基地的阴谋。美国是不能也不会扶助日本人民的，今天能够扶助日本人民的是中国。如果日本反动政府敢于接受美国重新武装的计划，那么日本必将因受到中国的抵制和反对而走上绝路。同时，各地人民也可打电报，写信给远东委员会、麦克阿瑟和日本的吉田政府，抗议美国违背国际协议的罪恶的阴谋。在给麦克阿瑟和吉田政府的信和电报中，应当警告美日反动派，如果撇开中苏两国，片面媾和，使日本走上武装和战争的道路，它们将担负一切后果。
    应该联合亚洲其他国家的人民共同反对美国重新武装日本的阴谋。各地人民可以通电和写信给亚洲各国人民（给日本和亚洲其他国家打电报和写信，都应由人民团体有组织地进行），说明中国人民与亚洲各国人民祸福与共，利害一致。反对美国重新武装日本是亚洲人民当前的最重要事情。这不仅关系中国安全，也关系着亚洲和平，关系着亚洲各国人民的切身利益。因此，一切爱好和平的亚洲各国的人民都应该积极参加到这个斗争中来。
