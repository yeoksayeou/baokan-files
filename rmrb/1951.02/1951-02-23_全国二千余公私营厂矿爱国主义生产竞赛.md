Nationwide Patriotic Production Competition in Over Two Thousand Public and Private Factories and Mines
　　Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Under the battle cry of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and defend our country, and through the initiatives of model workers Li Yong, Zhao Guoyou, and Zhang Zifu, the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the promotion of trade union organizations at all levels, a widespread patriotic production competition has been launched among workers across the country.
    From the Northeast to Hainan Island, which was liberated just over half a year ago, and from Shanghai and Qingdao to Dihua, 2,065 public and private factories and mines across the country have launched competitions. Incomplete statistics from only six provinces, four municipalities, and the railway system show that 1,662,396 people are participating in the competition. In the Northeast, there are 715,492 participants, and 70 percent of railway workers are involved in the competition.
    This patriotic competition was launched on the basis of the broad masses of workers’ high patriotic enthusiasm and after ideological education. Many workers spontaneously shouted the slogan "Machines are weapons, factories are battlefields," and a wave of competition swept from the bottom up. Therefore, the breadth of the competition is unprecedented. Not only workers are participating, but also technicians, staff, medical personnel, canteen staff, childcare workers, and even family members are involved in this great movement. Not only state-owned enterprises, but also private enterprises, not only factories and mines, but also financial and trade departments, stores, and workshops have launched competitions. In the competition, many factories and mines, based on the specific conditions of their units, put forward more specific requirements and formulated competition conditions, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of treating empty slogans as competition conditions.
    In the competition, the broad masses of workers have demonstrated high labor enthusiasm and wisdom, and therefore have achieved great results in production. Last year, more than 180 state-owned industrial and mining enterprises across the country completed or exceeded their annual plans ahead of schedule, and many new national records emerged. More importantly, the competition has strengthened the unity between workers and technicians, combining labor and technology, which has led to the emergence of technical improvements and rationalization proposals, greatly improving labor productivity. For example, Jiang Wanshou of the Shenyang Clothing Factory improved operating methods, increasing the factory's productivity fourfold. Technicians and workers at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant cooperated to create a sector pressure die, increasing work efficiency by 239 times. Zhou Baichen, a technician at the No. 53 Factory, combined with workers to improve the copper material pressing mold, saving more than two tons of copper material per month. Li Gaotian, a technician in Sujiatun, created a cutting machine, increasing efficiency by 80 times. Wang Hailian and Wang Xuebo of the Northwest Ordnance Repair Plant No. 3 improved tools, increasing efficiency by 20 times. Various mechanical plants in the Northeast learned the Soviet method of high-speed metal cutting, increasing cutting efficiency by one to ten times. This method of combining labor and technology to improve labor productivity has pointed out a clear direction for the continued development of labor competition in the future. In the competition, a large number of advanced producers and advanced production teams emerged. For example, Shenyang alone had 3,583 advanced producers (including 362 female workers), 480 advanced production teams, and 71 advanced sections, offices, and rooms. The railway workers in the Northeast, standing at the forefront of national defense, witnessed the heroic deeds of Li Shuyou, Yi Changgeng, Wang Jingbin (female), Yu Lihong, Zhang Faqing, Dong Lu, and others who insisted on working despite the dangers of bombing and strafing. These advanced figures and advanced teams have set an example for the broad masses of workers and have become the backbone of the competition.
    After the Ma Hengchang team challenged workers across the country, it immediately received a widespread response. As of February 21st, 1,383 units had accepted the challenge. This widespread, spontaneous Ma Hengchang team competition movement will raise the patriotic competition to a higher level, consolidate the existing competition achievements, and become the basic form and method of organizing labor competition, allowing labor competition to move forward steadily and continuously.
    However, there are still some basic shortcomings in the current patriotic production competition: First, neglecting the regularity of the competition and forming a rush tide is still an important defect in the current competition movement. Second, the competition still has a great deal of blindness. The conditions in many factories and mines are generalized, there are more top-down calls than bottom-up mobilizations, and the conditions have not been discussed by the workers, resulting in formalism. Third, the reward problem has not been properly resolved, making the competition lack material guarantees. Fourth, the grassroots trade union organizations are not sound, the organization and leadership of the competition are weak, and some administrative and trade union cadres even adopt intolerable bureaucratic attitudes. For example, the Guangzhou Steel No. 2 Factory believes that the competition spontaneously initiated by workers is "illegal," and the trade union of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory held the workers' challenge letter for ten days. Many units are not strengthening trade union work and promoting trade union organizations to realize leadership over the competition, but instead are taking over and doing everything themselves, even abandoning trade union organizations and forming competition committees, thus failing to exert greater organizational role and weakening leadership over the competition.
    Therefore, strengthening patriotic ideological education for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers, organizing widespread labor competitions on the basis of mass consciousness, formulating practical competition conditions, determining clear goals, strengthening the inspection of the competition, carrying out rationalization proposal work to combine labor and technology, avoiding simply increasing labor intensity, paying attention to improving business management, establishing a responsibility system and economic accounting system, correctly solving the reward problem, and improving trade union organizations to strengthen leadership over the competition through trade union organizations are important issues for making the competition a regular and lasting working method. In particular, attention should be paid to developing the Ma Hengchang team competition movement to develop the patriotic competition further.

　　全国二千余公私营厂矿爱国主义生产竞赛
    中华全国总工会生产部
    全国工人在抗美援朝保家卫国的战斗口号下，经过劳动模范李永、赵国有、张子富的发起，中华全国总工会的号召和各级工会组织的推动，广泛地掀起了爱国主义生产竞赛。
    从东北至解放仅半年多的海南岛，从上海、青岛至迪化，全国已有二千零六十五个公私营厂矿单位展开了竞赛。仅就六省四市和铁路系统的不完全统计，参加竞赛的就有一百六十六万二千三百九十六人。东北有七十一万五千四百九十二人，铁路职工有百分之七十都参加了竞赛。
    这次爱国主义竞赛是在广大工人群众高度爱国热忱的基础上，经过了时事教育而发动的。许多工人自发地喊出了“机器就是武器，工厂就是战场”的口号，自下而上地掀起了竞赛的热潮。因此，竞赛的广泛性为过去从来所没有，不仅工人参加，而且技术人员、职员、医务人员、食堂人员、保育员甚至连家属都卷入了这伟大的运动；不仅公营企业，而且包括私营企业，不仅工厂矿山，而且包括金融贸易部门、商店、作坊也展开了竞赛。竞赛中许多厂矿根据了本单位的具体情况，提出了较具体的要求，制订了竞赛条件，基本上改变了过去将空洞口号当作竞赛条件的现象。
    在竞赛中，广大工人群众发挥了高度的劳动热情和智慧，因此，在生产上获得了巨大的成绩。去年全国国营工矿企业有一百八十多单位提前或超额完成了全年计划，并出现了许多全国性的新纪录。尤其重要的是，在竞赛中加强了工人与技术人员的团结，使劳动与技术相结合，因而技术改进与合理化建议纷纷出现，大大提高了劳动生产率。如沈阳被服厂姜万寿改进操作方法，全厂生产力提高四倍。沈阳机器三厂技术员和工人合作创造了扇形压力?子，提高了工作效率二百三十九倍。五三厂技术员周柏臣与工人结合改进压铜料模子，每月节省铜料两吨多。苏家屯技术员李高田创造了切断机，提高了效率八十倍。西北修械三厂王海莲、王学薄改进工具，提高效率二十倍。东北各机械厂学习了苏联金属快速切削法，提高了切削效率一倍至十余倍。这种将劳动与技术相结合以提高劳动生产率的方法，给今后劳动竞赛的继续发展，指出了明确的方向。在竞赛中，涌现了大批先进生产者和先进生产小组。如沈阳就出现了三千五百八十三名（内有女工三百六十二名）先进生产者、四百八十个先进生产小组和七十一个先进科、股、室。站在国防最前线的东北铁路工人，在轰炸扫射下，出现了不顾危险坚持工作的李树有、伊长更、王静彬（女）、于立洪、张发庆、董禄等的英勇事迹。这些先进人物和先进小组给广大工人群众做出了榜样，成为竞赛中的骨干。
    当马恒昌小组向全国工人挑战后，立即得到广泛的响应，截至二月二十一日为止，已有一千三百八十三个单位应战。这种广泛的群众自发的马恒昌小组竞赛运动，将使爱国主义竞赛提高一步，将使已有的竞赛成绩巩固下来，也将成为劳动竞赛的基本形式与组织劳动竞赛的基本方法，并使劳动竞赛经常持久地稳步前进。
    但是，目前爱国主义生产竞赛中仍存在着一些基本缺点：第一，忽视竞赛的经常性，形成突击浪潮，还是当前竞赛运动的重要缺陷。第二，竞赛仍带有很大的盲目性，许多厂矿单位的条件一般化，自上而下的号召多于自下而上的发动，条件未经过工人群众讨论，结果成为形式主义。第三，奖励问题尚未适当解决，使竞赛缺乏物质保证。第四，工会基层组织不健全，对竞赛组织领导薄弱，甚至有的行政和工会干部采取令人不能容忍的官僚主义态度。如广州钢二厂认为工人自动搞起的竞赛“不合法”，太原晋生纺织厂工会把工人的挑战书一压就是十天。许多单位还不是从加强工会工作，推动工会组织去实现对竞赛的领导，而是包办代替，乃至抛开工会组织，另组织竞赛委员会，因而不能发挥更大的组织作用，削弱了对竞赛的领导。
    因此，加强抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育，激发工人群众的爱国热忱，在群众自觉的基础上组织广泛的劳动竞赛；制定切实可行的竞赛条件，确定明确目标；加强竞赛的检查；开展合理化建议工作，使劳动与技术结合，避免单纯加强劳动强度；注意改善经营管理，建立专责制与经济核算制；正确的解决奖励问题；健全工会组织，通过工会组织以加强对竞赛的领导，是目前使竞赛成为经常持久的工作方法的重要问题。特别是应注意开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动，使爱国主义竞赛更深入一步地发展。
