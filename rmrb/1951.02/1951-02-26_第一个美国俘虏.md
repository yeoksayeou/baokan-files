　　The First American Prisoner
　　Lin Hong
    Liles, the top advisor of the Second Regiment of the Li Seung-man bandit gang's pseudo-Sixth Division, was the first American prisoner captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield. Dou Shaoyi, a representative of the Volunteers who had just returned from the front lines in Korea, interrogated Liles. As an eyewitness, he described to me Liles's disgraceful appearance after being captured.
    In late October of last year, the American invading army crossed the 38th parallel and frantically advanced towards the Yalu River. The arrogance of the American and Li bandits was extremely high. Chiu Chi, the commander of the American invading army's 24th Division, arrogantly declared when ordering the division to advance towards the Chinese border overnight: "It would be strange indeed if we don't reach the Yalu River tomorrow." The South Korean puppet Li Seung-man also said that he would plant his Taegeukgi (the South Korean pseudo-national flag) on Mount Paektu (the highest peak of Changbai Mountain in our Northeast territory). At this time, the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea, undertaking the sacred duty of resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting our homes and defending our country. A unit of the Volunteers advanced south along Beizhen, reaching Fuxingdong near Wenjing on October 24th, where they suddenly encountered the advance troops of the American and Li bandit army's pseudo-Sixth Division, Second Regiment, Third Battalion. Our army, with swift and courageous actions, encircled the enemy from different directions. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, they completely annihilated the enemy, achieving the first victory in entering Korea to fight. From the mouths of the captured Li pseudo-soldiers, our army learned that there was also an American advisor in this regiment. Before going abroad to fight, the soldiers really wanted to see what the cruel and incorrigible American invading army actually looked like. Since an American prisoner had been captured, everyone was very happy and immediately checked all the prisoners. But there was no American. So the Volunteer troops began searching the mountains. After more than a day, this American officer still hadn't been found. Everyone thought that this guy must have escaped already.
    At dawn on the 26th, a soldier on guard duty on the mountain suddenly heard rustling sounds in the bushes. He was very surprised, and holding his gun, he went forward to take a look. It turned out to be a person. This was the American Major Advisor Liles. His face and hands were covered with blood from being scratched by branches and thorns. His thin, yellow hair and his face and hands covered in yellow hair were mixed with a lot of yellow soil. He stood trembling in front of the soldiers.
    Dou Shaoyi and several other comrades from the Volunteers sat calmly on the kang (heated brick bed). The soldiers brought Liles in. Dou Shaoyi said: "Completely beyond our expectations, this guy knelt down on both knees as soon as he entered the door. Seeing this ugly appearance of his, we were both angry and amused. So this is what the American invading army, who thought they were 'invincible', actually looked like!"
    "The United Nations should have let China participate long ago. This time I came to Korea, not only did others object, but even my wife was making a fuss about divorcing me." Liles said to himself like this as soon as he entered the door, before the Volunteer comrades even had time to ask him anything.
    This guy hadn't eaten for several days. Due to hunger and panic, he was still trembling constantly. He said these helpless words, obviously wanting to show that he was innocent and begging for the Volunteer comrades' forgiveness. This was a complete expression of a thief with a guilty conscience. The Volunteer comrades very gently invited him to sit down, and then asked him:
    "Why did the American army come to invade Korea?"
    "To liberate the Korean people and help them establish a democratic and free country."
    The Volunteer comrades were very angry and immediately pushed open the door and windows, pointing to the Korean villages and forests that were burning fiercely after being bombed by American planes, and said:
    "Is this your American-style liberation?"
    "I was wrong!" In the face of this ironclad fact, Liles could not quibble.
    "Why is America occupying our country's Taiwan?" The Volunteer comrades continued to ask.
    "Because Taiwan is related to the security of our America, it is within our national defense line."
    "If China draws San Francisco or Honolulu within its own national defense line, do you think this is an invasion?"
    "I was wrong again!"
    Through a translator, the Volunteer comrades explained to Liles our army's policy towards prisoners: guaranteeing his personal safety, not insulting his dignity, and allowing him to communicate with his family. Liles looked incredulous upon hearing this. Comrade Dou Shaoyi took out a pack of American-made Camel cigarettes and handed him a few. Liles asked in great surprise: "Where did you get these cigarettes?" The comrades smiled and said: "You sent them to us!" Liles took the cigarettes, looked at Comrade Dou Shaoyi, and then at the other comrades, still expressing doubt. The Volunteer comrades, knowing that he had been hungry for several days, asked the orderly to bring him some biscuits. When he took the biscuits, a smile appeared on his face. While eating the biscuits like a wolf, and smoking the cigarettes, he kept saying: "Thank you, thank you! I really didn't expect you Chinese People's Volunteers to be so good!"
    Especially interesting was that the Volunteer comrades discovered that Liles was wearing a copper tag around his neck and asked him: "What is this for?"
    "This is a dog tag," Liles replied.
    Every American soldier wears such a tag around his neck. If someone is killed in battle, as long as the tag is brought back, the American army will know the person's name and his detailed situation. "Dog"—this is what this American Major Officer, Liles, who had once been an instructor at West Point Military Academy, himself said.

### 第一个美国俘虏

　　第一个美国俘虏
　　林洪
    李承晚匪帮伪六师第二联队的最高顾问赖乐斯（Liles），是中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上捉到的第一个美国俘虏。刚从朝鲜前线归来的志愿军代表窦少义，曾审问过赖乐斯。他以目击者的资格，向我描述了赖乐斯被俘后的丑相。
    去年十月下旬，美国侵略军越过三八线，疯狂向鸭绿江边进攻。美李匪帮的气焰十分高涨。美国侵略军第二十四师师长邱奇，在命令该师连夜向中国边境推进的时候，狂妄地宣称：“如果我们明天到不了鸭绿江，那才真是怪事。”南朝鲜傀儡李承晚也说，要把它的太极旗（南朝鲜伪国旗）插到白头山上（我国东北境内长白山的最高峰）。我国人民志愿军于此时进入朝鲜，担负起抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣义务。志愿军某部沿北镇向南进军，于十月二十四日到达温井附近的复兴洞，突与美李匪军的先头部队伪六师第二联队第三大队遭遇。我军以勇猛神速的动作，分路包抄敌人；经过三、四个钟点的激烈战斗，全部歼灭了敌人，取得入朝作战的首次胜利。从李伪军俘虏的口中，我军知道这个联队里还有一个美国顾问。战士们出国参战以前，就很想看看残忍成性的美国侵略军究竟是个什么样子。既然捉到了美国俘虏，大家都非常高兴，立刻检查所有的俘虏。却不见有美国人。于是志愿军部队开始搜山。经过一天多的时间，仍然没有找到这个美国军官。大家想这个家伙一定早逃走了。
    二十六日拂晓，在山头上担任警戒的一位战士，突然听见草丛里传来嚓嚓的响声。他非常惊奇，端着枪上前一看，原来是一个人。这就是美国少校顾问赖乐斯。他的脸上和手上满是被树枝荆棘划破了的血痕，黄而稀的头发和满脸满手的黄毛上夹带着许多黄土，站在战士们的面前不断发抖。
    窦少义和志愿军的其他几个同志，安详地坐在炕上。战士们把赖乐斯带进来了。窦少义说：“完全出乎我们的意外，这家伙一进门就双膝向我们跪下了。看见他这一幅丑相，心里真是又是气，又是笑。原来自以为‘不可一世’的美国侵略军就是这个样子！”
    “联合国早就应该让中国参加。我这次来朝鲜，不但别人反对，连老婆也闹着要和我离婚。”赖乐斯刚进门，志愿军同志们还没有来得及发问，他就自言自语地这样说。
    这家伙已经几天没有吃饭了，由于饥饿和惊慌，还在不断地发抖。他说出这样几句无可奈何的话，显然是想表明自己无罪，哀求志愿军同志们的宽恕。这是十足的作贼心虚的表现。志愿军同志很温和地招呼他坐下，然后问他：
    “美国军队为什么要来侵略朝鲜？”
    “为了解放朝鲜人民，帮助他们建立民主自由的国家。”
    志愿军同志非常气愤，立刻推开门和窗，指着刚被美机轰炸后正熊熊燃烧着的朝鲜的村庄和树林，说：
    “这就是你们美国式的解放吗？”
    “我说错了！”在这铁一般的事实面前，赖乐斯无法狡赖。
    “美国为什么要侵占我国的台湾？”志愿军同志继续发问。
    “因为台湾关系着我们美国的安全，它处在我国的国防线以内。”
    “假若中国把旧金山或檀香山划在自己的国防线以内，你觉得这是不是侵略？”
    “我又说错了！”
    志愿军同志通过翻译，向赖乐斯说明了我军对待俘虏的政策：保证他的生命安全，不侮辱他的人格，并允许他和家里通信。赖乐斯听了，露出不相信的神情。窦少义同志拿出一包美国造的骆驼牌香烟，递给他几枝。赖乐斯非常惊奇地问道：“这香烟你们是那儿来的？”同志们笑着说：“这是你们给我们送来的！”赖乐斯接过香烟，看看窦少义同志，又看看其他几位同志，仍然表示疑惑。志愿军同志们因为知道他已经饿了几天，便叫勤务员拿一些饼干给他。当他接过饼干的时候，脸上露出了笑容。一面如狼似虎地吃着饼干，吸着香烟，一面连说：“谢谢，谢谢！我真想不到你们中国人民志愿军这样好！”
    特别有趣的是，志愿军同志们发现赖乐斯胸前挂着一个铜牌，就问他：“这是干什么用的？”
    “这是狗牌”赖乐斯回答说。
    每个美国士兵的胸前都挂着这样一个牌子。若是有人在战斗中牺牲，只要拿回这个牌子，美军部队就会知道这个人的姓名和他的详细情形。“狗”，——这是这位美国少校军官，曾经作过西点军校的教官的赖乐斯，自己这样说的。
