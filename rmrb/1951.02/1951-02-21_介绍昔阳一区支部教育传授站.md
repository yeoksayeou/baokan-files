　　Editor's note: According to the current situation of rural branches, it is urgent to strengthen the party's ideological education to improve the ideological and political level of rural party members. However, there are indeed some difficulties in carrying out this work at present. The most important of these is that the party committees have few people and many things to do, especially the lack of cultivated branch education personnel. Therefore, the experience of the Xiyang First District Branch Education Transmission Station is worthy of attention.
　　The reason why the Xiyang First District Party Committee has done a good job in running the branch education transmission station is mainly that the district party committee can recognize the importance of this work ideologically and personally lead and organize this work; secondly, the content of the lectures is in line with actual needs, solving some ideological problems that party members urgently need to solve, and thus has been welcomed by party members.
　　Most of the CCP branches in the villages of the First District of Xiyang County were established after 1945. In the past few years, these branches have realized their leading role in various practical struggles, and all party members have been tempered in these struggles. However, because the branches have been in various struggle environments since their establishment, there has been no time to conduct systematic basic knowledge education for party members. Therefore, a considerable number of party members know very little about the basic knowledge of the party, which hinders the continued improvement of their awareness and the performance of their work. Many branches have asked the district party committee to provide systematic party education. The district party committee also felt that this was an urgent task in the work of the party. However, there are some difficulties in carrying out this work. For example, the district committee has very few cadres, and their cultural and political level is not high. It is impossible to give lectures to all branches universally. After studying this situation in early November last year, the district party committee decided that Comrade Zhang Xidan, the secretary of the district party committee, should be responsible for trying to build a branch education transmission station near the residence of the district party committee. After more than a month of experimentation, the results were very good, and it was realized that this was one of the important methods for conducting branch education. Therefore, since December last year, the district has universally established such transmission stations throughout the district. The district's seventy-seven branches are divided into seven transmission stations: Chengguan, Beizhangcheng, Yanjiawo, Wujiapin, Bazhou, and Liangzhuang.
　　In terms of leadership, the district party secretary, propaganda member, and cultural officer are the main leaders, and seven party members with higher political levels among the primary school teachers are absorbed to form the district's branch education transmission committee, which is under the unified leadership of the district committee and is responsible for carrying out work. The transmission time is to convene the education committee members of each village branch to transmit once a month (once every seven days during party rectification). Each time, try to solve one problem and make it purposeful to transmit. Before the transmission, the transmitter first goes deep into a branch to understand the ideological situation of party members and prepare. Then, based on the party member textbooks and branch teaching materials issued by the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, combined with the ideological situation of the branch party members, a positive explanation is given. After the explanation, a discussion is organized, and everyone is guided to conduct self-examination in connection with their own thoughts. When there are problems, answers are given. The branch education transmission station also often contacts the district's branch education transmission committee. In this way, on the one hand, they can get timely help from the leadership, and on the other hand, they can report the situation of the transmission work below to the leadership in time, so that the leadership's help to each transmission station is more practical. For example, the leaders often use the common problems raised by the various transmission stations as the content of the next transmission.
　　In more than two months, the First District Branch Education Transmission Station has conducted basic knowledge education for party members; the specific questions raised by party members have also been answered in a timely manner. Party members have a very full enthusiasm for learning, and branch teachers have a high interest in transmission. For example, the Yanzhuang transmission station (including eleven branches) initially used the evening time for transmission. Later, everyone felt that the time was too short to solve the problem, and they automatically requested to change it to half a day during the day. Another example is Jinshipo and Hedong branches of Wujiapin Station. Because there are few literate people in the branch and the educational level of the branch education committee members is low, they are afraid that one person will not remember it, so they automatically came with more people. Party members who knew a few words were vying to participate in the study. The learning enthusiasm of ordinary party members has also been consistent. When studying, they arrange their own production properly and are always unwilling to miss a study session for nothing. This kind of study has indeed solved many problems. For example, after studying the production reward policy, it solved the muddled thinking among party members that "they dare not let the masses freely buy and sell land." After studying the basic knowledge of the party, the Hedong branch clearly understood the rights and obligations of party members; especially after studying the conditions of party members, they were all surprised and said: "Oh! It's not easy to be a party member. We only knew that party members should actively work and take the lead." At the same time, it corrected the erroneous idea of some party members that "joining the party is just attending a few more meetings." The Liangzhuang branch has a total of twenty-two party members. Originally, four party members did not do any work at all, and three party members took a passive and perfunctory attitude towards work. After studying at the transmission station, the ideological awareness of party members has been significantly improved, and their work has become more active and responsible.
　　After the establishment of the branch education transmission station, it not only educated party members, but also greatly helped the district party committee leadership, and learned a lot of things through the transmission station itself.

### 介绍昔阳一区支部教育传授站

　　介绍昔阳一区支部教育传授站
    编者按：按照目前农村支部情况，急需加强党的思想教育，以提高农村党员的思想水平与政治水平。但是目前在进行这一工作时，确实存在一些困难，其中最主要的是党委人少事多，特别是缺乏有修养的支部教育人员。因此昔阳一区支部教育传授站的经验，是值得重视的。
    昔阳一区区委所以办好了支部教育传授站，主要是区委能够从思想上认识这一工作的重要性，亲自领导与组织这一工作；其次，讲课内容切合实际需要，解决了党员思想上迫切需要解决的一些思想问题，因而受到了党员的欢迎。
    山西昔阳县一区各村中共支部，大部分是在一九四五年以后建立起来的。几年来，这些支部在各种实际斗争中，都实现了自己的领导作用，而全体党员也在这些斗争中得到了锻炼。但是也因为支部建立之后，一直处在各种斗争环境中，没有时间对党员进行系统的党的基本知识教育。因此有相当一部分党员，对于党的基本知识了解的很少，这就妨碍了他们觉悟程度的继续提高与做好自己的工作。许多支部要求区委给予有系统的党的教育。区委也感到这是党的工作中一个迫切的任务。可是要进行这一工作，是存在着一些困难的。例如区委会干部很少，文化、政治水平也不高，如果普遍的去给各支部上课，是不可能的。去年十一月初，区委研究了这种情况后，决定由区委书记张喜旦同志负责，在区委驻地附近试建支部教育传授站。经过一个多月的实验，成绩很好，并体会到这是进行支部教育的重要方法之一。于是该区自去年十二月开始，即在全区普遍建立了这样的传授站。全区七十七个支部，分设了城关、北掌城、阎家窝、武家坪、巴洲、梁庄等七个传授站。
    在领导上，以区委书记、宣传委员、文化干事为主，并吸收了小学教员中七个政治水平较高的党员，组成区的支部教育传授委员会，在区委会的统一领导下，分工负责进行工作。传授时间，每月召集各村支部教育委员传授一次（整党时七日一次），每次尽可能解决一个问题，作到有目的的去传授。传授之前，先由传授人深入一个支部，了解党员思想情况，进行准备。然后依据中共中央华北局和中共山西省委印发的党员课本、支部教材，结合支部党员思想情况，进行正面讲解。讲解后组织讨论，并引导大家联系自己思想进行检查，有问题时，进行解答。支部教育传授站又经常与区的支部教育传授委员会取得联系。这样，一方面可以及时的得到领导上的帮助，另一方面随时将下面传授工作的情况及时反映给领导上，使领导上对于各个传授站的帮助更加切合实际。例如领导上常把各个传授站普遍提出的问题，做为下一次传授的内容。
    一区支部教育传授站在两个多月中，对党员进行了党的基本知识教育；党员提出的具体问题，也及时地做了解答。党员学习情绪非常饱满，支部教员传授兴趣也很高。如阎庄传授站（包括十一个支部）开始是利用晚上时间进行传授，后来大家感到时间太短，不解决问题，自动要求改为白天半天。又如武家坪站的金石坡、河东等支部，因支部中识字的人少，支部教育委员文化程度又低，只怕一人记不住，就自动的多来了几个人。稍识几个字的党员，都争着要参加学习。一般党员的学习情绪也始终如一，到学习时，把自己的生产安排得妥妥当当，总不肯白白误过一次学习。这种学习，确实解决了不少问题，例如在学习了生产奖励政策后，解决了党员中“不敢让群众自由买卖土地”的糊涂思想。河东支部学习了党的基本知识，明确了解了党员的权利与义务；特别是学习了党员的条件之后，都惊奇的说：“啊呀！当个党员可是不简单呀，咱原来只知道党员是积极工作起带头作用就可以了。”同时纠正了某些党员以为“入党就是多开几个会”的错误观念。梁庄支部共有二十二个党员，原来有四个党员根本不做工作，三个党员对工作采取消极应付的态度。经过在传授站的学习后，党员的思想觉悟便有了显著的提高，工作也积极负责了。
    支部教育传授站建立起来后，不但教育了党员，而且对区委领导也有很大的帮助，通过传授站自己也学习了不少东西。
