　　Beijing Construction Bureau's Reply Regarding Road Repair
    Editor:
    We have seen Comrade Wan Peizhi's suggestion in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on January 24th, regarding "the government should regularly inspect and repair roads." Upon investigation, the roads around the south entrance of Baimiao Hutong on the old Xingbu Street were constructed when the weather was gradually turning cold. The asphalt poured on the gravel could not penetrate and bond properly. After discovering this situation, our bureau immediately stopped continuing the construction of asphalt roads and changed the Wo Fo Si (Temple of the Sleeping Buddha) Street to a gravel road. The last part of the road constructed before the work was stopped has some localized damage, which has been repaired with gravel. We will thoroughly repair it with asphalt after the weather warms up. This was due to negligence on the part of our bureau's construction department, which resulted in losses to the work. Comrade Wan Peizhi's letter pointing out our bureau's shortcomings is of great help to our work, and we express our sincere gratitude.
            Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau

### 京市建设局对修补马路的答复

　　京市建设局对修补马路的答复
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月二十四日“读者来信专页”所刊万佩之同志对“政府应经常检查并补修马路”的建议看到了。查旧刑部街白庙胡同南口左右马路，因施工时天气已渐寒冷，沥青浇在石碴上不能渗入，并且不能粘结。本局发现这种情形后，即停止继续修筑沥青路，将卧佛寺街改修为石碴路。在未停止以前所修的最后一部分，现有局部破坏情形，已用石碴补修完竣。等到天暖后再用沥青彻底补修。这是本局施工部门疏忽大意，致使工作遭受损失。万佩之同志来信指出本局缺点，对我们工作的帮助很大，特此感谢。
            北京市人民政府建设局
