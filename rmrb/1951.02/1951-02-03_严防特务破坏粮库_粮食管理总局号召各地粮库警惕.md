Strictly Prevent Special Agents from Sabotaging Grain Depots
General Administration of Grain Management Calls on Grain Depots in Various Locations to be Vigilant

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, have successively set fires to grain depots and murdered our staff in Baoding and Tongxian in Hebei, Liyang, Jiangyin, Suzhou, and Jiangning in Southern Jiangsu, in an attempt to sabotage. With the Spring Festival approaching, the General Administration of Grain Management specifically calls on staff at grain depots in various locations to raise their vigilance, adhere to the implementation of duty and inspection systems, improve the organization of grain protection and fire prevention, strengthen security, and maintain strict precautions to prevent special agents and bad elements from taking the opportunity to sabotage.

1.  Grain depots at all levels should, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government in December of last year regarding adjusting measures for protecting public grain warehouses, proactively contact local public security forces and militia, and in conjunction with the employees of each warehouse, jointly organize duty and patrol teams, rotating day and night inside and outside the warehouse. At the same time, they should leverage the mass strength of the grain protection committee and neighborhood groups.

2.  Grain depots in densely populated areas should pay attention to understanding suspicious individuals near the warehouses. They should also educate the masses in advance, prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers near the warehouses.

3.  A thorough inspection of fire prevention equipment inside the warehouses must be conducted. If there is any damage or deficiency, it should be immediately supplemented. Rural warehouses generally must have water storage and sandbag facilities.

[Another Report] Grain depots in land reform areas have successively discovered incidents of arson and sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and bad elements. For example, a fire broke out at the Huaihua County Trading Company Grain Depot in the Central-South District, burning down seventeen warehouse rooms and causing a loss of over ten thousand catties of grain. A fire at the Suining General Warehouse resulted in the loss of over four thousand catties of public grain. The Zhijiang County warehouse caught fire three times, and the Huang County warehouse twice. In addition, similar incidents occurred in Qianyang, Shupu, and Fuling and Shizhu counties in Eastern Sichuan. Except for the warehouse and 20,000 catties of public grain burned down in Shizhu County, the causes of which have not been ascertained, it has been determined that the rest were organized acts of sabotage by unlawful landlords and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. Furthermore, incidents of large landlords using arsenic to poison three of our staff, as well as oxen and pigs, occurred in Chenxi County in the Central-South District and Fuling County in Eastern Sichuan. To protect national property and the safety of our staff, grain depots at all levels and local cadres at all levels should heighten their vigilance and strengthen security work.

　　严防特务破坏粮库
    粮食管理总局号召各地粮库警惕
    【本报讯】抗美援朝运动展开以来，蒋匪特务在美帝指使下，先后在河北保定、通县、苏南溧阳、江阴、苏州、江宁等地粮库，纵火烧粮及戕害我工作人员，阴谋破坏。目前春节即届，粮食管理总局特号召各地粮库的工作人员，提起高度警惕，坚持贯彻值勤、检查制度，健全护粮防火组织，加强警卫，严密防范，防止特务和坏分子乘机破坏。
    一、各级粮库应根据上年十二月中央人民政府公安、财政两部对调整保护公粮仓库办法的指示主动地联系当地公安部队、民兵，结合各该仓库员工，共同组织值班、巡逻小组，分别昼夜在库内外轮流值勤。同时并发挥护粮委员会及四邻小组的群众力量。
    二、在人烟较稠密地区的粮库，应注意了解靠近仓库四周的可疑分子。并事先向群众宣传，禁止在仓库附近燃放鞭炮。
    三、切实检查库内的防火设备，如有损坏或不足，应即加以补充；农村仓库一般须有贮水及沙包设备。
    【又讯】土地改革地区的粮库，先后发现有被蒋匪特务和坏分子放火破坏的事件。如中南区怀化县贸易公司粮库起火，烧毁库房十七间，损失粮食万余斤；绥宁总仓库失火损失公粮四千余斤；芷江县仓库起火三次，晃县二次；此外，黔阳、淑浦以及川东的涪陵、石柱等县均发生同样事件。以上除石柱县被烧毁仓库及公粮二万斤未查明原因外，其余已查明均为不法地主与蒋匪特务有组织的破坏行为。又中南区辰溪、川东涪陵等县还发生大地主用砒霜毒死我工作人员三人及耕牛、猪等谋害事件。为保护国家财产及我工作人员生命的安全，各级粮库及各级地方干部均应提高警惕，加强保卫工作。
