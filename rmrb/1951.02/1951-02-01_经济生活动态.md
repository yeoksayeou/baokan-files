            Southern Native Products Sell Well in Tianjin
    Private businesses in Tianjin are actively preparing for the New Year and vigorously promoting native products from various parts of southern China. Fresh fruits such as sugarcane from Fujian and Guangdong, oranges (including thirteen kinds of oranges like Guang oranges and Chao oranges), Tian Tai tangerines and Golden Coin tangerines from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as southern red and white sugar, porcelain from Jiangxi, bamboo chopsticks from Ningbo, and star anise from Guangzhou, have been successively transported to Tianjin and are already appearing on the market, selling quite well.
            Xi'an Industrial and Commercial Circles Begin Revaluing Assets
    The Xi'an Municipal Industrial and Commercial Property Revaluation Review Committee was established on January 15th. Most industry associations in the city have held mobilization meetings, and twenty-nine industries have conducted group discussions. The Federation of Industry and Commerce is now organizing various industry associations to establish "Property Revaluation Promotion Groups" to specifically promote the revaluation of assets and capital adjustment in their respective industries.
            Problems with Grain Collection in Yiwu County, Liaoxi
    When deploying the collection of cotton grain in Yiwu County, Liaoxi, in November last year, no investigation and research were conducted, and the task was simply assigned. As a result, the phenomenon of equal distribution occurred in some areas, requiring both cotton growers and non-cotton growers to pay public grain cotton. For example, in Hailiangtun Village, only one hundred out of four hundred households grew cotton, but every household had to pay public grain cotton. The supply of cotton could not meet the demand, and the price was high, which invisibly increased the burden on the vast number of non-cotton growers, causing them to suffer losses. This kind of error that damages the interests of the broad masses of people due to a purely task-oriented perspective in work must be immediately brought to attention and corrected.
            Hebei Province Cooperatives Actively Transfer Spring Plowing Materials
    In order to prepare spring plowing materials, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative is actively transferring 106 million catties of soybean cake, 2.34 million catties of fertilizer powder, and 1.5 million catties of bamboo brooms. These materials will be rationed and sold in February and March according to the needs of the members.
            Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee Holds Training Classes
    The "Land Reform" class, one of the three training classes held by the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, has seen over four hundred unemployed workers who graduated and went to work in northern Anhui and other places since last October, earning high praise from local farmers. Several even won first-class and special-class merits in land reform evaluations. On January 20th of this year, the committee launched six more training classes in driving, machinery and electrical engineering, chemical engineering, accounting, labor administration, and career transition, expecting to absorb 3,000 unemployed workers for studies. The study period is from two months to one year, and registration is now open.
            Land of War Criminals Like Ma Bufang to be Returned to Peasants
    According to preliminary statistics, the land of war criminals Ma Bufang, Ma Buqing, and Ma Hongkui in the Linxia District of Gansu Province amounts to about 12,000 mu. Recently, the District Commissioner's Office decided, with the approval of the Provincial People's Government, to distribute this land fairly and reasonably to landless and land-poor peasants under the principle of national unity and development of production. In order to do a good job in this work, the CPC District Committee and the Commissioner's Office transferred 140 cadres to specifically organize a work team, which, after studying, went to various counties in the district on the 7th of this month to carry out the work.

            辽西义乌县征粮工作有问题
    辽西义乌县去年十一月间布置征收棉花公粮时，不加调查研究，即将任务布置下去，因此有的地区产生了平均摊派的现象，使植棉户与非植棉户一律交纳公粮棉。如海粮屯村四百户中只一百户种棉花，但每户都需交纳公粮棉，棉花供不应求，价格就高，广大非植棉户无形中加重了负担，吃亏不少。此种因工作中的单纯任务观点而损害广大人民利益的错误，必须立即引起注意，加以改正。
