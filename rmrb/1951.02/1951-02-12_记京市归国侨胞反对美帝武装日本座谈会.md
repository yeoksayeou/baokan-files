　　Record of Beijing Overseas Chinese's Symposium Against American Imperialism's Arming of Japan
　　Zhu Bo
    From 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM on February 2nd, at a symposium convened by the Beijing Overseas Chinese Association, over twenty returned overseas Chinese, including Li Tiemin, Fei Zhendong, Hong Sisi, Wang Jinding, Lu Cheng, and Wu Ruiying, expressed their extreme anger towards American imperialism's scheme to unilaterally make peace with and rearm Japan. They recalled the persecution they personally suffered from the Japanese invaders in the past and launched accusations against the crimes of the Japanese invaders. Lu Cheng, the former chairman of the All-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions, who was unreasonably expelled from Malaya by the British imperial authorities, recounted the atrocities of the Japanese invaders against overseas Chinese in Malaya. The Japanese invaders occupied Malaya for a total of three years and eight months, during which Malaya became a world of blood and tears. When the Japanese invaders attacked Malaya, he was working in a factory. At dawn in February 1942, the first Japanese bomb fell near the factory. In those few minutes, more than thirty overseas Chinese lost their lives. He excitedly said, "This blood debt has not yet been repaid, and many Japanese war criminals who massacred the people are still at large under the cover of American imperialism. American imperialism is attempting to abandon the people of China and the Soviet Union, make peace with Japan alone, and rearm Japan, wanting the Japanese invaders to make a comeback. The workers and all working people of Malaya will never forget the persecution they suffered from the Japanese invaders in the past. They will definitely join hands with the people of the whole country, the people of all of Asia, and the Japanese people to fight against the common enemy, American imperialism!" The overseas Chinese youth Lin Guiying recounted the crime of the Japanese invaders massacring her entire family of sixteen people. One night in March 1942, the Japanese troops stationed in Johor, Malaya, tied up her grandmother, father, stepmother, eight young siblings, aunt, cousin, workers, secretary, and other sixteen people, and looted all of her family's property. Later, she heard that they and more than two hundred other overseas Chinese were driven by the Japanese invaders to a forest near Batu Pahat and were all massacred. At that time, Lin Guiying and her mother lived in another house and were spared. She said, "When I hear the words 'Japanese invaders,' I think of the hatred of my entire family being massacred. If American imperialism rearms Japan, it will destroy many happy families. I believe that every overseas Chinese with a family will never allow American imperialism to arm Japan."
    Wu Ruiying returned from Southeast Asia last year. Her husband, Guo Houjue, was a famous Esperantist who was killed by the Japanese invaders in Sumatra in 1942. At this symposium, she spoke with tears in her eyes, choking with sobs, "It has been nearly ten years since my husband was killed by the Japanese invaders. In these long years, I have never forgotten my hatred for the Japanese invaders. Because the words 'Japanese invaders' stimulate me too much. Now that American imperialism wants to rearm Japan, we Chinese people must not tolerate it. I will do everything in my power to oppose this American conspiracy!" Hong Sisi, the manager of Nanyang Daily, said, "The blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders to the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia cannot be counted. When you mention the Japanese invaders, no overseas Chinese does not hate them. Today, American imperialism wants to rearm Japan, which will inevitably be fiercely opposed by more than ten million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia."
    Shi Xiyong, an overseas Chinese from Pontianak, Indonesia, said, "The Japanese invaders killed more than two thousand people in Pontianak, which has a population of only 20,000, most of whom were our overseas Chinese. My father was also one of those who were massacred at that time. More than two thousand people died for no reason. At that time, we all thought that they had been sent by the Japanese invaders to other areas to work as coolies. It was not until after the surrender of the Japanese invaders that many human bones and many rotten corpses were found in the small garden of the governor's office and at the airport that people knew the whereabouts of their relatives. Today, American imperialism's rearming of Japan is aimed at using the Japanese as its tool for massacring overseas Chinese and all peace-loving people. But the awakened millions of overseas Chinese already have their own powerful motherland and will no longer allow American imperialism to trample on them. American imperialism will definitely be badly battered." Yu Shuying, an overseas Chinese youth who returned from the Philippines, sadly recalled the past persecution of overseas Chinese and local people in the Philippines by the Japanese invaders. She said, "American imperialism's rearming of Japan reminds me of the painful life under the rule of the Japanese invaders in the past. We must never repeat the suffering of the past. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines will definitely resolutely oppose this shameless conspiracy of American imperialism."

　　记京市归国侨胞反对美帝武装日本座谈会
　　朱波
    二月二日上午九时到下午四时，在北京市归国华侨联谊会召集的座谈会上，归国侨胞李铁民、费振东、洪丝丝、汪金丁、芦成、吴瑞英等二十余人，对美帝国主义对日片面媾和及重新武装日本的阴谋，表示了极大的愤怒。他们回忆起过去亲身所遭受的日寇的迫害，展开了对日寇罪恶的控诉。遭受马来亚英帝当局无理驱逐出境的马来亚各民族各业总工会前主席芦成，诉说了日寇在马来亚迫害华侨的暴行。日寇占领马来亚共计三年又八个月，在这期间，马来亚变成了血和泪的世界。日寇进攻马来亚时，他正在一个工厂里做工，一九四二年二月的一个拂晓，日寇的飞机把第一颗炸弹丢在工厂附近。就在这数分钟内，有三十多个侨胞牺牲了生命。他激动地说：“这一笔血债还没有讨回，很多屠杀人民的日本战犯，在美帝掩护下还逍遥法外；美帝却又企图抛开中、苏两国人民，单独对日媾和，重新武装日本，想要日寇卷土重来。马来亚的工人及一切劳动人民，绝不会忘记过去日寇对他们的迫害。他们一定会和全国人民、全亚洲人民，以及日本人民拉起手来，向共同的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争！”华侨青年林桂英，诉说了日寇屠杀她全家十六口人的罪行。那是一九四二年三月间的一个夜里，驻马来亚柔佛州的日军，把她祖母、父亲、庶母、八个年幼的弟、妹和姑母、表弟及工人、书记等十六人捆走，并劫去了她家的全部财产。后来她才听说他们和另外二百多个侨胞，被日寇赶到吧都巴附近的一个森林里，全部残杀了。当时，林桂英和她母亲住在另外一所宅子里，得以免遭毒手。她说：“我听到‘日寇’两个字，就想起了我全家被屠杀的仇恨。如果美帝重新武装日本，将会使很多幸福的家庭被毁灭。我相信每个有家庭的华侨，绝不会容许美帝武装日本。”
    吴瑞英是去年从南洋回来的。她的丈夫郭后觉是著名的世界语学家，一九四二年在苏门答腊遭日寇杀害。在这次座谈会上，她眼睛里含着泪水，哽咽着诉说道，“我丈夫被日寇害死已经将近十个年头了。在这漫长的岁月里，我从没有一天忘记对日寇的仇恨。因为‘日寇’这两个字对我的刺激太大了。现在美帝又要武装日本，我们中国人民决不能容忍。我要尽一切力量反对美国这种阴谋！”南侨日报经理洪丝丝说：“日寇欠南洋华侨的血债是没有办法统计的。提起日寇，没有一个华侨不痛恨的。今天美帝要武装日本，必将遭到南洋一千多万华侨的激烈反对。”
    来自印尼坤甸的华侨史习勇说：“日寇在只有两万人口的坤甸，杀死了两千多人，其中大部分是我们的侨胞。我父亲也是当时被屠杀的一个。这两千多人死得不明不白。那时，我们都以为被日寇送到其它地区作苦工去了。直到日寇投降后，在总督府的小花园内和飞机场里，发现了很多人骨和许多已腐烂的尸体，人们才知道了自己亲人的下落。今天美帝重新武装日本，目的就是把日本人作为它屠杀华侨以及一切和平人民的工具。但是觉悟了的千百万华侨，已经有了自己的强大的祖国，再也不容许美帝践踏。美帝一定会碰得头破血流。”从菲律宾回来的华侨青年俞淑英，沉痛地回忆了过去日寇对菲律宾华侨及当地人民的迫害。她说：“美帝国主义重新武装日本，使我想起过去日寇统治下的痛苦的生活。我们决不能再重复过去的苦难生活。菲律宾的华侨一定会坚决反对美帝这一无耻的阴谋。”
