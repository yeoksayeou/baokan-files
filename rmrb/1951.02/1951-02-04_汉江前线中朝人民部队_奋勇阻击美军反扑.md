Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 3rd: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Han River front are bravely fighting against the northward advance of the American invading army. A certain unit, in an area twenty miles deep north of Suwon and Yongin, is repulsing the repeated offensives of the American invading army. In the four days from January 28th to 31st, the advancing American troops suffered over 700 casualties. During these four days, the invading army launched dozens of joint land and air attacks on this area every day. However, the warriors of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army crushed these offensives. They stood firm on the smoke-filled positions. After losing some advanced outposts during the day, the People's Volunteer Army immediately organized counterattacks at night and recaptured them. In the night counterattacks on January 27th and 28th, the People's Volunteer Army twice stormed into the city of Suwon. A certain unit also penetrated the highway south of the city, killing and wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers. In another night counterattack, the Volunteer Army annihilated an American command post, killing and wounding about 100 enemy soldiers, destroying four jeeps and five ammunition-laden trucks, and capturing the command post's radio.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 3rd: Our front-line reporter reports: The First Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with fewer troops defeating more, fiercely annihilated the American invading army advancing from Jinchuan towards our Yangjiri position east of Suwon. On January 22nd, more than 200 American invading troops, traveling in fifteen cars and six jeeps, under the cover of seventeen tanks, advanced from the Jinchuan area towards the position of the First Platoon of a certain unit of our Volunteer Army in the Yangjiri area. The enemy launched four assaults in succession, firing more than 100 artillery shells continuously at the position, and bombing in turn with more than ten aircraft. However, the position of the First Platoon of our Volunteer Army remained unshaken. In the four-hour fierce battle, a total of more than 30 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, one enemy jeep was destroyed, and one light machine gun and three automatic rifles and carbines were captured. In this battle, the First Platoon of our defending troops not only held the position, but also suffered only one death and two injuries, creating a casualty ratio of ten to one between the enemy and the Volunteer Army, and therefore won a commendation from the leaders of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army.

　　汉江前线中朝人民部队
    奋勇阻击美军反扑
    【新华社汉城三日电】本社前线记者报道：在汉江前线的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军正奋勇抗击北犯的美国侵略军。某部在水原、龙仁以北二十里纵深的地区，阻击着美国侵略军的轮番进攻，在一月二十八日至三十一日的四天中，使进犯美军伤亡达七百余人。在这四天中，侵略军每天白天都向这个地区进行数十次陆、空军的联合进攻。但是，中国人民志愿军某部的勇士们粉碎了这些进攻。屹然坚守在硝烟弥漫的阵地上，某些前哨阵地在白天失去后，人民志愿军立即在晚间组织反击，将它们夺回。在一月二十七、二十八两日夜间举行的反击中，人民志愿军曾两度攻入水原城。某部并深入到城南公路线上，共毙伤敌军六十余人。在另一次夜间反击中，志愿军歼灭了美军的一个指挥所，毙伤敌军约百名，击毁吉普车四辆和满载弹药的卡车五辆，并缴获了该指挥所的电台。
    【新华社汉城三日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军某部第一排，以少胜多，痛歼在水原以东由镇川向我阳智里阵地进犯的美国侵略军。一月二十二日，美国侵略军二百余人，分乘汽车十五辆和吉普车六辆，在十七辆坦克掩护下由镇川方面向阳智里一带我志愿军某部第一排阵地进犯。敌人先后发起四次冲锋，连续向阵地发射炮弹百余发，并以十余架飞机轮番轰炸。但我志愿军第一排阵地屹然未动。在四小时激战中，计毙伤敌三十余人，击毁敌吉普车一辆，并缴获轻机枪一挺及自动步枪与卡宾枪三支。在这次战斗中，我守军第一排不仅守住了阵地，而且仅阵亡一人、伤二人，创造了敌军与志愿军伤亡十与一的比例，因而荣获志愿军某部首长的通令嘉奖。
