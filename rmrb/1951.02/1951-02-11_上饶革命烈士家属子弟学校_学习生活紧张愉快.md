　　Tense and Happy Study Life
　　[By Our Reporter] The students of the Shangrao Revolutionary Martyr's Family Children's School in Jiangxi Province are living a tense and happy study life under the kind care of the motherland.

　　The Shangrao Revolutionary Martyr's Family Children's School is a cultural supplementary school established by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government after the liberation of Jiangxi Province to cultivate the children of revolutionary martyrs in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi border area during the land revolution period. There are now more than four hundred students in the school. When they first entered the school, more than half of the students were illiterate or knew very few characters, some of whom were over twenty years old. The school divided them into twelve classes for education according to their age and cultural level, and the teachers provided individual tutoring after class. Now the students' cultural level has been significantly improved. Of the students who were originally illiterate, 65 percent now know 500 to 1,000 characters; the students who are doing well are now reading textbooks for the second year of junior high school. Fang Sheng, the nephew of the late General Fang Zhimin (his father was a guerrilla captain of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army), was twenty-five years old when he entered the school, and he did not know a single character at that time. Now he knows about a thousand characters.

　　The students' political awareness has also been significantly improved over the past year, and 56 students have joined the New Democratic Youth League. Last year, all the students saved the pocket money given to them by the school and collectively bought public bonds. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, they enthusiastically donated comfort money to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　上饶革命烈士家属子弟学校
　  学习生活紧张愉快
    【本报讯】江西省上饶革命烈士家属子弟学校的学生在祖国亲切的抚育下，过着紧张愉快的学习生活。
    上饶革命烈士家属子弟学校是江西省解放后，该省人民政府为培养土地革命时期闽浙赣边区革命烈士子弟所设立的文化补习学校。现在全校有四百多个学生。在刚入学时，有一半以上的学生不识字或识字很少，其中有的年龄已在二十岁以上。学校根据他们的年龄和文化水平，编成了十二个班级进行教育，教师们并在课后加以个别辅导。现在学生们的文化水平已有显著提高。原来不识字的学生已有百分之六十五识了五百字到一千字；成绩好的现在已在读初中二年级的课本。先烈方志敏将军的侄子方圣（他父亲是中国工农红军的一个游击队队长），入校时已二十五岁，那时他一字不识，现在已识了一千个字左右。
    学生们的政治认识一年来也有了显著的提高，全校已有五十六人参加了新民主主义青年团。去年全校学生把学校发给他们的生活零用费节省下来集体买了公债。在抗美援朝运动中，他们并热情地捐献慰问金慰问中国人民志愿军。
