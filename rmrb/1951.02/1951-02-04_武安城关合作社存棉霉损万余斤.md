    Wu'an Chengguan Cooperative
    More Than Ten Thousand Jin of Stored Cotton Spoiled

    Comrade Editor:
    Last year, the Wu'an Chengguan Cooperative acted as an agent for state-owned stores in purchasing cotton. Due to the lack of thorough planning by the cooperative's leadership for this huge task, and insufficient preparation for warehouse storage, the cotton was piled up haphazardly in the yard after being purchased, resulting in 98,470 jin of cotton being exposed to rain. In the most severe cases of spoilage, the cotton seeds germinated to a length of more than an inch; generally, all of it was generating heat. According to losses, 12,974 jin of *Gossypium hirsutum* 2B Grade 4 cotton was downgraded to Grade 5 after spoilage, 3,572 jin were downgraded to Grade 7, and 1,300 jin were downgraded to Grade 8, totaling 17,846 jin of downgraded cotton, resulting in a loss equivalent to 3,294 jin of millet.

    The Wu'an County People's Government Supervisory Committee discovered this situation and immediately went to the cooperative with the Industry and Commerce Section to investigate the cause of the loss. The branch director, Zhang Kuilu, and He Dating, were given demerits for their careless and lax work style and their lack of a high sense of responsibility for state property. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and the Cotton Policy Guidance Office repeatedly urged and inspected the cotton warehouse, but they should also bear some responsibility because they did not personally inspect the site.

    武安城关合作社
    存棉霉损万余斤编辑同志：
    去年武安城关合作分社为国营商店代购棉花，由于该社领导上对此巨大任务缺乏周密的计划，仓库保管工作准备不足，致使收购后无处存放，随便在院内堆积，结果，使九万八千四百七十斤棉花遭受雨淋。霉烂最厉害的，棉籽发芽达一寸多长，一般的都已发热。按损失的是斯籽棉二Ｂ丙四棉，霉烂后降低为丙五者为一万二千九百七十四斤，降为丙七者为三千五百七十二斤，降到丙八者为一千三百斤，总共降级棉花一万七千八百四十六斤，受损失折小米三千二百九十四斤。
    此种情况已经武安县人民政府监察委员会发觉，当即协同工商科亲到该社检查损失原因。该分社主任张奎鲁、贺大庭对工作粗枝大叶，麻痹松懈，缺乏对国家资财高度负责的精神，已予以记过处分。县供销社、花纱布公司、棉政指导处虽曾一再督促检查棉库，但由于他们自己都未临现场检查，亦应负一定责任。
