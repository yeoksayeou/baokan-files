　　US Railroad Strike Continues to Expand
    Xinhua News Agency, February 7th: Despite the Truman administration's declaration that the railway strike constitutes "a threat to national security," the American railway strike continues to expand. According to Reuters, as of the 4th, the strike had spread to fifty railways, encompassing one hundred large and small railway cities across the country. The strike has brought more production sectors to a standstill and threatens the ammunition supply for the American forces invading Korea. The total number of workers idled, including those in the steel, automobile, and other industries, has increased to 160,000. Due to the halt in railway freight, the munitions originally scheduled for delivery to the invading Korean troops are stuck in the arsenals and cannot be transported. A Chicago Army spokesman stated that if the strike is not resolved quickly, the American forces invading Korea will also face an ammunition panic. The US government is making every effort to spread propaganda claiming that the strike endangers "national security" and the "war effort," slandering the striking workers' actions to improve their working conditions by exercising their right to strike. At the same time, the US authorities are also instigating strikebreakers to launch a back-to-work movement. However, as of the 5th, the strike is still ongoing.

　　美铁路罢工继续扩大
    【新华社七日讯】在杜鲁门政府宣布铁路罢工是“对国家安全的威胁”之后，美国铁路罢工仍继续扩大。据路透社消息，截四日止，罢工已蔓延五十条铁路、扩及全国一百座大小铁路城市。罢工已使更多的生产部门陷于停顿，并威胁了侵朝美军的弹药接济。包括钢铁、汽车及其他工业的停工工人，总数已增加到十六万人。由于铁路货运的停顿，原定运给侵朝军队的军火，被阻于兵工厂中无法运出。芝加哥陆军方面发言人表示，罢工若不能迅即得到解决，侵朝美军的弹药也将发生恐慌。美国政府正竭力散布所谓罢工危害“国家安全”和“战争努力”之类宣传，污蔑罢工工人为改善劳动条件而使用其罢工权利的行动；同时，美国当局还通过工贼策动复工运动。但迄五日止，罢工仍在坚持中。
