　　[本报讯] Various democratic parties and people from all walks of life have issued statements supporting Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement on February 2nd and opposing the United Nations General Assembly's illegal passage of the U.S. imperialist's motion to slander our country. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a statement saying: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, representing all comrades of the Democratic Revolutionary Committee, expresses its anger at the U.S. imperialists' manipulation of the United Nations to pass a so-called resolution condemning China and slandering China as an aggressor! We express our support for the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on February 2nd! The statement pointed out: After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. government rejected our proposal to end the Korean War and related issues in the Far East through negotiations, rejected the twelve-nation proposal to convene a seven-nation conference, and disregarded the opinions of many countries with peaceful aspirations participating in the United Nations, openly proposing a brutal and unreasonable slander against China. This behavior only shows that it opposes peace, insists on war, and has no repentance, and will not give up until its demise. The statement said: Since the U.S. imperialists insist on aggression and expanding the war, the Chinese people have no choice but to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, expand the unity of international forces, and resolutely struggle until its aggressive atrocities are completely crushed! A spokesperson for the China Democratic League issued a written statement on the General Assembly's illegal passage of a resolution slandering China, pointing out that there is a saying in China: "The thief cries, 'Stop thief!'" This sentence fully explains the reason why the U.S. imperialists want to use despicable and shameless means to slander our country. The spokesperson said: Today, to deal with this "dog" that is barking wildly by the U.S. imperialists, we can only strengthen our sacred movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and give it severe blows and sanctions. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a statement on the 4th stating: Due to this illegal, defamatory, invalid, fact-distorting, absurd, and shameless proposal by U.S. imperialism, all the Chinese people, the people of Asia, and the peace-loving people of the world have a deeper understanding of the hideous faces of the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices who want war and aggression. The statement stated: The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party resolutely supports Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement representing the will of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the peace-loving people of the world, and will further deepen and universally carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and fight to the end to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea and China. The statement issued by the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' proposal to slander China is to expand the war of aggression against Korea, destroy world peace, and achieve its goal of dominating the world. The statement said: We fully support and resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and call on all railway workers to more universally carry out patriotic production competitions. The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement condemning the U.S. imperialists' shameless slander against China, stating that our capital's industrialists and businessmen will not only resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, but will also unite more closely under the banner of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, contribute all our strength, and resolutely support our volunteers aiding Korea and the Korean People's Army to liberate all of Korea from the aggressors. In addition, members of the Beijing Agricultural University Trade Union issued a statement, and Baiman Girls' High School issued a declaration, all unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement.
　　The Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and eight other organizations jointly issued a statement on the 4th stating: The U.S. imperialists' illegal defamatory behavior fully proves that it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and it also proves that the content of its manipulation of the "majority" is becoming more and more empty. All of this has further strengthened our determination and confidence that we can defeat the aggressors.
　　The statement from the Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions and seventeen other organizations pointed out: The U.S. imperialists' perverse actions are a concrete manifestation of isolation and despair.
　　Peng Kang, president of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, pointed out: The U.S. imperialists' slander cannot affect the Chinese people's determination to oppose American aggression in the slightest. He cited the example of the Shandong people donating 520 million yuan in a short period of time to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, saying: This fully demonstrates the Shandong people's determination and strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Yi Lihui, chairman of the Fujian Shipping Company Trade Union, said: The U.S. Seventh Fleet has invaded our territory Taiwan. The aggressor is precisely U.S. imperialism itself.

    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会山东分会会长彭康指出：美帝国主义的谰言丝毫不能影响中国人民反对美国侵略的决心。他就山东人民为慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在短短时间内捐献五亿二千万元的事例说：这充分表现了山东人民抗美援朝的决心和力量。福建轮船公司工会主席伊立惠说：美国的第七舰队侵略了我国领土台湾，侵略者正是美帝国主义自己。
