　　Chahar Province Longyan Iron Mine Pangjiabao Mine

　　Reversal of Work Results in Twelve Billion Yuan Loss

　　Due to the lack of investigation and research by the leaders of the Pangjiabao Mine, a subsidiary of the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua, Chahar Province, in the construction of civil engineering projects, rework and waste occurred, resulting in a loss of over 12.1634 billion yuan in state assets.

　　The houses built by the Pangjiabao Mine during the Japanese occupation were all built with substandard materials and had very unstable foundations. However, the mine leaders did not study this situation and blindly carried out restoration and construction, so that shortly after the station and warehouse were built, it was discovered that the walls were already crooked, and the gable walls and front walls had cracks more than an inch wide. Later, the entire gable wall and part of the front wall had to be demolished and new piles built to temporarily solve the problem of unstable foundations. The second dormitory of Pangjiabao is too close to the revetment, and its durability can only reach six-tenths of the expected service life at most. In July last year, cracks appeared in the gable wall of the repair shop, resulting in the demolition of the gable wall and the construction of a new foundation.

　　Liu Yi, deputy director of the mine's construction committee, said: "I've been working with my head down for a year, and I'm all confused!" Some engineers also admitted: "It's like taking a fleeting glance at the site, there's no investigation or research to speak of." For example, 1.2 million brick blanks were made during the Japanese occupation, and at least five years had passed by last year. Although they looked perfect on the surface, they had already lost their adhesiveness. The mine leaders neither investigated nor researched, and rashly decided to fire these blanks in order to save money. As a result, most of the blanks were burned into powdered bricks. According to the mine's estimate, more than 720,000 bricks were lost, and the quality of the "block bricks" that had been fired was also very poor. When planning to build 500 earth cave dwellings, rough estimates were used to replace construction plans. There were extreme errors in the design of soil conditions, earth cave angles, distances, etc.; the construction time did not take into account climate changes and flood control facilities. As a result, many of the earth caves collapsed as soon as they were dug. The collapse of individual newly built earth caves has killed and injured workers. The excavation project has been 86 percent completed, and only 25 earth caves are currently used as "warehouses," while the rest have been destroyed or closed. This engineering waste amounts to more than 350,000 jin of rice.

　　The phenomenon of no one being responsible in the process of civil engineering construction at the mine is extremely serious. Although the dispersed work sites increased many difficulties in management, the lack of responsibility for engineering plans, finished product inspection, and material storage was the direct cause of waste. For example, when building earth caves, the work was contracted to local farmers. At the beginning, there was no fixed supervisor, so it happened that they only cared about pursuing quantity and did not pay attention to quality at all. Although collapses occurred continuously, the mine leaders did not pay enough attention to them, resulting in such serious waste. During the rainy season last year, many materials were washed away or damaged by floods. In May, 16.9 tons of lime was washed away in one instance. Due to the lack of flood control channel facilities and substandard foundations, the foundations of some projects at the mine were sunk by rain, resulting in serious rework and waste. It is hoped that the mine leaders will carefully examine and improve their work.

### 察省龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场  反工损失十二亿元

　　察省龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场
　  反工损失十二亿元
    察省宣化龙烟铁矿所属庞家堡矿场，在土木工程的修建过程中，由于该矿领导上没有调查研究，造成反工浪费，使国家财富损失达十二亿一千六百三十四万余元。
    庞家堡矿在日寇统治时期所建筑的房屋，都是偷工减料，地基很不稳固的。但该矿领导上对这一情况不加研究，盲目地进行恢复和建设，以致车站、仓库盖好不久，便发现墙已歪了，山墙和前墙裂了一寸多宽的缝。后来只得把全部山墙和部分的前墙拆毁，从新打桩建筑，才算暂时解决了地基不稳的毛病。庞家堡第二宿舍离护坡的距离过近，耐久年限最多仅能达到预计使用年限的十分之六。去年七月间，修理厂的山墙发生裂缝，结果把山墙拆毁，另打地基从新建筑。
    该矿建筑委员会副主任刘毅说：“作了一年的闷头工作，都弄糊涂了！”有的工程师也承认：“到现场走马观花似的，说不上什么调查研究。”如在日寇统治时期打的一百二十万块砖坯，到去年最少也经过了五年之久，从表面上看虽然完好无缺，但早已失去了粘结性，该矿领导上既没调查也没研究，就冒然地决定烧这些坯，为的是省钱，结果大部分的坯被烧成粉砖，据该矿估计：损失七十二万多块砖，已烧成的“块砖”，其质量也很坏。当计划修建五百间土窑洞时，用轮廓的估计，代替施工计划。对于土质情况、土窑角度、距离等的设计上都有极大的错误；修建时间没注意气候的变化及防洪的设备。因此，许多的土窑刚刚挖好就塌毁了。个别新建土窑的塌毁，曾经砸死和砸伤过工人。挖窑工程已经完成百分之八十六，现仅用二十五个土窑作为“仓库”，其他都被毁坏或封闭。这一笔工程浪费，即达三十五万余斤米。
    该矿土木建筑过程中的无人负责现象是异常严重的。虽然工作现场分散，增加了管理上的许多困难，但工程计划、成品检验和材料保管上的无人负责，却是直接造成浪费的原因。例如修建土窑时，包给当地农民做，开始时没有一个固定的监工人员，因此，就发生了只顾追求数量，而根本不注意质量。塌毁现象虽连续发生，但该矿领导上没有高度重视，以致造成如此严重的浪费恶果。去年雨季，把许多材料被洪水冲走或损毁。五月间，一次冲走白灰十六点九吨。由于没有防洪水道设备和地基不合规格，该矿部分工程的地基，致被雨水冲陷，又造成严重的翻工浪费现象。希望该矿领导干部认真检查，并改进工作。
