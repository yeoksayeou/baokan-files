A brief Discussion on the Creation of Songs Praising Chairman Mao
Zhou Weizhi

　　It is a glorious but also arduous task to use poetry and songs to praise the people's leader Chairman Mao, to depict the heroic image of the leader, and to express the people's infinite respect and deep feelings for the leader. "The East is Red," composed by Shaanxi farmers, has become a popular mass song nationwide; after liberation, the working class and other working people have also written many poems full of pure emotion to express their love for their leader. Last year's National Day celebration saw various ethnic groups bringing many songs praising Chairman Mao. Our poets and musicians have also written many songs praising Chairman Mao, some of which have become popular among the masses. However, there are still some issues in the songs praising Chairman Mao that should be seriously and carefully considered.

　　I have read over twenty songs praising Chairman Mao, some of which were created by the masses themselves. The most common phrases in these songs are "Great Savior," "Benefactor," "Like Parents," or "The North Star," "Helped us turn ourselves over," "Following him," and "Remembering the source when drinking water," etc. Only a few songs mention the power of the people. Although these songs reflect the masses' sincere love and gratitude for Chairman Mao, they do not fully reflect the correct relationship between the leader and the masses, or they do not reflect it appropriately enough. The greatness of the leader relies on his sincere belief in the masses, relying on the masses, and being good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses and leveraging the power of the masses. Therefore, he can lead the masses to victory in extremely difficult and complex struggles. Sun Wanfu, a folk poet from northern Shaanxi, once used the two sentences, "High-rise buildings rise from the ground, dragons coil and tigers crouch on the top of high mountains" to praise Chairman Mao. "Coiled dragons and crouching tigers" must rely on "high mountains," and "high-rise buildings" must be built from "the ground." In this way, he correctly expressed the relationship between the leader and the masses, rather than portraying the leader as a "superman" and a "savior."

　　Many songs praising Chairman Mao still fail to fully express the masses' sincere enthusiasm for loving the leader and the power to inspire people to move forward. We demand to praise our Chairman Mao with the most enthusiastic, the most intimate, and the most emotional language and music. The expression of this emotion stems from the author's deep feeling of the supreme importance of the people's revolutionary cause. He intimately experiences the happiness and joy brought by victory, and personally sees how people have become so intelligent, brave, and creative in the new life, thus uncontrollably generating an impulse, an urgent desire to praise his leader. This is a true outpouring of emotion, an unreserved expression, wanting to praise the new life in front of the leader and among the broad masses of the people, to express one's inner joy and sincere gratitude, and to express one's lofty respect and love for the leader. Therefore, its mood is healthy and happy, full of upward spirit. It is a true paean, not the kind of frivolous, superficial, and pretentious "popular song," nor the kind of rigid "ceremonial music." Unfortunately, some of our songs have quite a few shortcomings.

　　For example, "Song of Mao Zedong," with lyrics by Zhang Chunqiao and music by Lu Su. Although the lyrics emphasize Chairman Mao's fortitude and fighting spirit, and his leadership role in the revolution, the image he chooses is a "sea swallow" in a storm, in "boundless darkness and misty night." It lacks a powerful depiction of the great leader and the rapidly developing power of the people. In addition, the melody is too bland, and the emotions are melancholic, especially: which is even more sentimental. Some people believe that its tone is influenced by religious hymns, and this is not without reason. Although this song was created ten years ago, it was welcomed by some young intellectuals in the newly liberated cities, but from the perspective of the overall thoughts and feelings, it is very far from the people now.

　　Some songs have empty words and lack enthusiasm. For example, in a narrative song called "Singing Chairman Mao" (lyrics by Damin and Zhu Meng, music by Geng Jie and Yi Ming), the author begins by writing about how China has the Communist Party, the Communist Party is like the sun, and Chairman Mao is like parents. Then, it writes about how Chairman Mao led the people to oppose imperialism and feudalism, organized the Red Army to make revolution in Jinggang Mountain, smashed five encirclements, and later went on the Long March, went north to resist Japan, established the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, went deep behind enemy lines, and defeated the Japanese devils. Later, the Liberation War was carried out, the farmers carried out land reform and engaged in production, and turned themselves into masters. It sings all the way to "The army and the people unite to eliminate the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, the whole of China is liberated, and happiness will last forever." In a total of seven paragraphs of lyrics, there is very little emotional description, which is not vivid. Another word is even more flatly written: "Mao Zedong, you are so good, the Communist Party, you are leading, your team can fight, your comrades are highly skilled, love the people is really thoughtful, defeat the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and make contributions, we have you Mao Zedong, life is getting better and better!" Such sentences can hardly be regarded as lyrics, how can they be moving? Another bad tendency is to use a very superficial and undignified tone to praise the people's leader, such as: "Northwest Farmers Sing Praising Chairman Mao," lyrics by Wei Feng and music by Gui Bin. The whole tone is also not enthusiastic and weak. The first few sentences are similar to the labor songs of northern Shaanxi, and the mood is very depressed, especially: etc., which is even more frivolous and ridiculous. It is inappropriate to use such music to praise Chairman Mao. Another example is in Lu Na's "People Sing Four Times," each verse adds five "Long Ge Long", some as long as twenty beats, such as: It sounds glib and undignified.

　　There is also a song "Singing Chairman Mao", each verse has five "that" - "The sun that comes out and shines in all directions, China that has the Communist Party. Hey, the Communist Party, like the sun. That Chairman Mao is like parents. Hey, he gives the people ideas, that is busy day and night. Hey, with Mao Zedong, China has hope." The composer seems to be seeking a lively tune, but he did not consider what a bad influence it has on a solemn eulogy to add so many "that"!

　　I think the mood of the paean should be enthusiastic, and it can also be written lively, with a mass style, but it is definitely not to use a glib tone, use some old tastes to replace the people's feelings of praising their leader, and spread this unhealthy, superficial tone among the people. Although the above inappropriate expression methods are not necessarily caused by an unserious creative attitude, at least in terms of emotional grasp and creative methods, it is worthy of review. This also includes the question of how to correctly use folk music tunes. In folk songs, sometimes some interjections such as "Ai Hai Yo" (some are used as exclamations) and empty words such as "that" are added, some are to express the voice of labor, or are produced due to the linguistic taste of folk songs and the lack of auxiliary melodies; if we write lyrics praising the leader today and also use these things, then it is wrong. In the past, some people even used a very bad little tune from Shanxi to sing "Chairman Mao is the sun," which made people feel very uncomfortable. Although there are many healthy and bright tunes in folk songs, and many majestic and powerful songs are also produced in collective labor, since folk songs generally originate from rural areas in the feudal era, the thoughts and feelings are, in any case, very different from the new life. Using it to express the new people's feelings for their leader has great limitations. Therefore, when we use the melody of folk songs to express new thoughts and feelings, if we do not select and develop it, we will not be able to achieve our creative purpose. Especially when writing songs for the masses to sing praising the leader, greater development is needed. Even when writing lyrical solos and duets, if old folk songs are selected, they should also be transformed according to new feelings. Absolutely no unprincipled use of those inappropriate, backward, and unhealthy folk song tunes.

　　Creating songs praising Chairman Mao is not an easy task. We need to better understand the people's feelings for the leader, be good at choosing a certain aspect, a certain corner to depict the relationship between the leader and the people, and the people's love for the leader. Originally, it is impossible to put a lot of things into a short lyric and music, we do not need to write about many things, detailing the development of history. The most important requirements are profound thoughts and full emotions, vivid language and powerful tunes. We do not necessarily have to write large choruses and large instrumental pieces, we can also write unison singing, duets, small solos, small instrumental pieces, etc., and do not have to force uniformity. What is particularly needed at present is unison singing songs praising Chairman Mao that can be sung by the broad masses.

　　July 1st this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Writing more and better songs praising Chairman Mao is a good gift to the great people's political party and the people's leader. I think we should bravely shoulder this task, learn more, think more, write more, and we will definitely be able to produce powerful, ideological songs that can fully express the sincere and profound feelings between the masses and the leader.

　　略谈歌颂毛主席的歌曲创作
　　周巍峙
    用诗和歌曲来歌颂和赞美人民的领袖毛主席，描绘领袖的英雄形象，表达人民对领袖无限的尊敬与深厚的感情，这是很光荣的但也是很艰巨的任务。陕北农民所作的《东方红》，已成为全国流行的群众歌曲；解放后的工人群众及其它劳动人民也写了许多充满纯真感情的诗歌来抒发对于自己领袖的挚爱。去年国庆节，各兄弟民族更带来了许多歌颂毛主席的歌曲节目。我们的诗人和音乐家也写了不少歌颂毛主席的歌曲，这些歌曲有的已在广大群众中流行。但在歌颂毛主席的歌曲当中，也还存在一些问题，应该严肃地认真地加以考虑。
    我看了二十几个歌颂毛主席的歌曲，有的是群众自己的创作，在这些歌曲里最常见的词句是“大救星”、“恩人”、“像爹娘”，或者“北斗星”、“帮助咱们把身翻”、“跟着他”，以及“饮水要思源”等等，仅仅有少数歌子提到人民的力量。这些歌曲虽然反映了群众对毛主席衷心的敬爱与感激，却没有充分反映出领袖与群众之间的正确的关系，或者反映得还不够恰当。领袖的伟大就依靠于他是真诚地相信群众，依靠群众，善于集中群众的智慧，发挥群众的力量，因此他才能领导群众在十分艰巨与复杂的斗争中赢得胜利。陕北民间的诗人孙万福曾用：“高楼大厦平地起，蟠龙卧虎高山顶”这两句话歌颂毛主席，“蟠龙卧虎”要依靠“高山”，“高楼大厦”要从“平地”建起。这样他就把领袖与群众的关系正确地表现出来了。而不是把领袖写成了“超人”与“救世主”。
    许多歌颂毛主席的歌曲还不能完满地表达群众敬爱领袖的真挚的热情。与鼓舞人们前进的力量。我们要求用最热烈，最亲切，最富于情感的语言与音乐歌颂我们的毛主席。这种情感的发挥是由于作者深刻地感觉到人民革命事业的至高无上。他十分亲切地体会到胜利所带来的幸福与快乐，亲眼看到人们在新的生活中都变得那样的聪明、勇敢，富于创造精神，因而不可抑止地产生一种冲动，一种急切要求歌颂自己领袖的冲动。这是真情流露，毫无拘束地倾吐，要在领袖面前，在广大人民中间歌颂新的生活，畅述自己内心的欣喜与真诚的感激，表达自己对领袖的崇高敬爱。因此它的情绪是健康愉快，充满向上精神的。它是真正的颂歌，绝不是那种轻佻肤浅，矫揉做作的“流行歌曲”，也不是那种呆板的“仪式音乐”。可惜，我们的某些歌曲却存在着很不少的缺点。
    如由张春桥作词，卢肃作曲的“毛泽东之歌”。词中虽也着重说明了毛主席刚毅的战斗精神，以及他在革命中的领导作用，但他所选取的形象是暴风雨中的“海燕”，是“黑暗无边，夜雾茫茫”。对伟大领袖与迅速发展的人民力量缺乏有力的描绘。加上曲调过于平淡，情感沉郁，特别是：则更带有感伤的成份。有人认为它的情调受了宗教赞美诗的影响，这不是没有原因的。虽然这个歌曲是十年前的创作，在新解放的城市中，也曾为一部分青年知识分子所欢迎，但从整个思想情感来看，却和现在人民的距离很远了。
    有的歌曲是词句空洞，缺乏热情。如《歌唱毛主席》的一首叙事歌中（大民、朱孟词，耿介、怡明曲），作者从中国有了共产党，共产党像太阳，毛主席像爹娘写起，接着就写毛主席如何领导人民反帝反封建，组织红军在井冈山闹革命，粉碎五次围攻，后来经过万里长征，北上抗日，建立陕甘宁边区，深入敌后，打得鬼子投了降，后来又进行解放战争，农民们实行土改闹生产，翻身作主人，一直唱到“军民团结消灭贼老蒋，全中国解放，幸福永无疆”，总共七段词中，感情的描写极少，很不生动。另一词更是平板地写着：“毛泽东你真好，共产党你呀领导，你的呀队伍能呀打仗，你的呀同志本呀领高，爱人民真周到，打败蒋匪立呀功劳，咱们呀有你毛呀泽东，日子呀越过越呀是好！”像这样句子，简直不能算做歌词，怎么能感动人呢？另一种不好的倾向是用一种非常肤浅的与不庄重的情调来歌颂人民的领袖，如：魏风作词，贵彬作曲的《西北农民歌颂毛主席》一歌，整个情调也是不热烈的和无力的。开头几句和陕北民歌揽工歌相似，情绪很沉闷，特别是：等句，更显得轻浮与滑稽。用这样的乐曲来歌颂毛主席是不相称的。又如吕呐作的《人民四唱》里，每段歌词，加了五个“龙格龙”，有的竟长到二十拍，如：听起来觉得油腔滑调，十分不庄严。
    还有《歌唱毛主席》一歌，每段词中有五个“那个”——“太阳那个出来哎照四方，中国那个有了共产党。哎，共产党啊，像太阳。那个毛主席那个像爹娘。哎，他给人民出主张，那个辛苦日夜忙。哎有了毛泽东中国就有了希望。”作曲者似乎为了求得曲调活泼，竟没考虑到加了这许多“那个”，对一个庄严的颂词起着怎样坏的影响！
    我想，颂歌的情绪应该热烈也可以写得活泼，具有群众风格，但绝不是要用油腔滑调的口吻，用一些旧的趣味来代替人民歌颂自己领袖的情感，在人民群众中传布这种不健康的，肤浅的情调。上述不适当的表现方法虽不一定都是由于创作态度不严肃所造成，但至少在情感掌握与创作方法上是值得加以检讨的。这里面还包括了对民歌曲调如何正确运用的问题。在民歌中有时加了一些“哎嗨哟”的语助词（有些是作感叹词）以及“那个”一类的虚字，有的是为了表现劳动的呼声，或者是由于民歌的语言趣味与补助曲调的不足而产生；在今天我们写歌颂领袖的歌词，也搬用这些东西，那就错了。过去甚至有人用山西的一种很坏的小调配上“毛主席是太阳”来唱，听起来使人十分难受。民歌中虽有不少健康的、明快的曲调，在集体劳动中还产生许多雄壮有力的歌声，但是一般民歌既产生于封建时代的农村，思想情感无论如何都和新的生活有很大距离。用它来表现新的人民对自己领袖的情感，它的局限性是很大的。因此当我们采用民歌的旋律，来表现新的思想情感，如果不加以选择和发展，将无法达到我们的创作目的。特别是写群众唱的歌颂领袖的歌曲时，需要更大的发展。就是写抒情的独唱、对唱时，如果选用旧的民歌，也要根据新的感情，加以改造。对于那些不合适的、落后的、不健康的民歌曲调，绝不能无原则地搬用。
    创作歌颂毛主席的歌曲本不是一件轻而易举的工作，我们需要更好地去理解人民对领袖的情感，善于选择某一侧面，某一角落来描绘领袖与人民的关系，人民热爱领袖的情绪。本来在一首短短的歌词与乐曲不可能装进很多的东西去，我们不必写到许多事物，详述历史的发展。最主要的要求是深刻的思想与饱满的情感，生动的语言与有力的曲调。我们不一定都写大合唱，大器乐曲，也可以写成齐唱、对唱、与小的独唱，小型器乐曲等，不必强求一律。目前特别需要的是广大群众能唱的歌颂毛主席的齐唱歌曲。
    今年七月一日是中国共产党三十周年纪念日，多写些更好的歌颂毛主席的歌曲，正是献给伟大的人民政党与人民领袖的好礼物。我想我们应当勇敢担负起这一任务，更多地学习，更多地思索，更多地写作，一定能够产生有力量、富有思想性，能够充分表达群众与领袖间诚挚深厚的情感的歌曲。（附歌曲）
