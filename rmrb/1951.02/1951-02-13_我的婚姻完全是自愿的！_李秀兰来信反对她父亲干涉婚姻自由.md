　　“My Marriage Is Entirely Voluntary!”        
    Li Xiulan Writes to Oppose Her Father's Interference in Marital Freedom
    To the Editor:
    I am a female worker at the Taiyuan Textile Factory, and I am nineteen years old this year. At work, I developed feelings for Comrade Zhang Bin. After a period of mutual understanding during our courtship, we are willing to join hands on the revolutionary road and become a revolutionary couple. However, my father does not agree with our union. I have repeatedly explained and persuaded him, but to no avail. On the evening of January 11th, he even threatened me, demanding that I break off relations with Zhang Bin, or he would strangle me with a rope. At the time, I was afraid that he would really harm me, so I pretended to agree. The next day, for my own safety and to break free from the shackles of the feudal family, I fled the family. With the support of the trade union, Comrade Zhang Bin and I, in accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Law, got married on January 15th. After we got married, my father was still not convinced and could not shake off his feudal ideas. He even fabricated facts to slander Comrade Zhang Bin, saying that he had deceived and seduced me. My father has filed four lawsuits against Comrade Zhang Bin. Under these circumstances, I want to express my attitude. My marriage is entirely voluntary, and no one has deceived or seduced me. I am a woman of the new society, I understand the Marriage Law, and I want to strive for the social status that women in New China deserve.
    I believe that my father should not fabricate facts and arbitrarily falsely accuse Comrade Zhang Bin; nor should he threaten his daughter to break off relations with Comrade Zhang Bin. I firmly oppose my father's feudal ideas of insisting on arranged marriage. I hope you will publish my letter in the newspaper to educate my father so that he can change his feudal ideas.

　　“我的婚姻完全是自愿的！”        
    李秀兰来信反对她父亲干涉婚姻自由
    编辑同志：
    我是太原织造厂的女工，今年十九岁。在工作中，我与张斌同志发生了感情。我们经过恋爱期间的互相了解，愿意在革命的道路上携手并进，结为革命夫妇。但是，我父亲不同意我们俩结合。我再三向他进行解释说服，但仍无效。他在一月十一日晚上竟威吓我，要我与张斌断绝关系，否则就用麻绳把我勒死。我当时怕他真的害我，就假装答应了。次日，我为了我的生命安全和摆脱封建家庭的锁链，即逃出家庭。在工会的支持下，我和张斌同志根据婚姻法的规定，在一月十五日结了婚。我俩结婚后，我父亲还是不服气，打不通封建思想。他竟捏造事实，污蔑张斌同志，说他欺骗、引诱了我。我父亲曾先后把张斌同志告了四状。在这个情况下，我要表明我的态度。我的婚姻完全是自愿的，别人并没有欺骗我、引诱我。我是新社会的妇女，我懂得婚姻法，并且要争取新中国妇女应有的社会地位。
    我认为我的父亲不应该捏造事实，任意诬告张斌同志；更不应该威吓女儿与张斌同志断绝关系。对于我父亲这种坚持包办婚姻的封建思想，我坚决反对。希望你们把我的信公布在报上，以教育我的父亲，使他能够改变他的封建思想。
                                            李秀兰  二月二日
