    February 23rd is Soviet Red Army Day. As the forces of the world peace and democracy camp grow stronger day by day, understanding the power of the Soviet Red Army can give us more confidence; learning from the Soviet experience in building the army can further help our national defense construction. The above two books are recently translated and published, and both are worth recommending, especially "On Soviet Military Science," which is written very concisely and profoundly. These two books have different focuses. Here is an introduction to each of them.

    First, let's introduce "On Soviet Military Science," originally titled "On the Superiority of Soviet Military Science Compared to Bourgeois Military Science." The entire book is only 23,000 words, yet it manages to be neither too shallow for specialized readers nor too deep for general readers. It can be roughly divided into three parts: from the beginning to page 16 discusses the essence of Soviet military science, from page 17 to page 45 exposes the weakness of bourgeois military science, and from page 46 to the end discusses the correct relationship between military science and military art.

    The author's two most basic judgments on the essence of Soviet military science precisely correspond to the two basic points indicated by Chairman Mao in "On Practice," namely: 1. Military science is tested and developed through practice and experience; 2. Military science has class nature and party spirit. Regarding the first point, the book only makes the most general explanation: "To correctly understand the essence of military science in our time, we must first clarify the role of the broad masses of people in war and establish military art based on their role." (page 8) The author mainly explains in detail the class nature of military science: "The social phenomenon of war is inherent in class society," and war is politics conducted by violent means. Therefore, "any military theory is a class theory," and the degree of power of military science "is determined by which class the armed forces serve the interests of." (page 7)

    Then the author analyzes that modern warfare is conducted by the people of various countries, so "if we want to correctly understand the essence of modern military science, we must first understand the great role of the broad masses of people in modern warfare, and understand the significance of the people's own interests in this war" (page 7). "True military science cannot but take into account the people's attitude towards the purpose of the war, and cannot but take into account the important significance of the people's willingness to contribute all their energy and their entire lives to achieve victory."

    The author points out that the bourgeoisie cannot accept this basic law of military science because the wars prepared by imperialism are unjust, aggressive, and do not conform to the interests of the people. Thus, they "formulate forms and methods of conducting war that rely as little as possible on the masses of the people. This tendency of bourgeois military theory to contradict the principles of modern military science itself cannot be successful in fighting against strong enemies, because these forms and methods rarely or do not at all conform to the conditions and nature of warfare in the machine age." (page 9) Naturally, it cannot be said that bourgeois military theory cannot formulate forms and methods of armed struggle using the power of modern equipment, but according to the experience of World War II, "it has been proven that bourgeois military science cannot sufficiently utilize the military and economic forces created by the level of modern productivity and military technology... How the combat capability of the armed forces is, whether the armed forces are good at maximizing the full power of modern combat weapons and tools, and whether the rear area on which the armed forces rely is solid, is now more than ever determined by the social system of the country and whether the purpose of the war conforms to the interests of the people." The inherent and internal social and economic contradictions of the capitalist system prevent it from fully utilizing military and economic forces, and this "cannot be eliminated as long as the bourgeois system exists. The reactionary imperialist essence of the decadent bourgeois ideology of modern imperialist countries, especially the United States, deprives their military theories of scientific basis and makes them unable to conform to the nature and qualities of the war in the machine age." (page 11)

    Thus, the author points out: "Soviet military science, in its essence, is partisan, and it has become a progressive military science because it serves the interests of the Soviet socialist country and the most progressive social system... Soviet military science, in the most just war—in the war of the Soviet socialist country against imperialist aggressors, formulates and determines the path to victory." (page 13) "Comrade Stalin created Soviet military science based on Marxism-Leninism. The starting point of this military science must not only study the methods and tools of modern warfare, campaign, and battle, but also be based on a correct understanding of economic and spiritual potential, and based on the thorough utilization of the economic power of the Soviet socialist country, the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and the indomitable will to defeat imperialist aggressors." (page 15) "...Soviet military science is the only military science that starts from a correct understanding of the role and consciousness of not only the military but also the economic and spiritual potential in modern warfare, and starts from a correct understanding of the essence of those material and spiritual factors that determine the development and outcome of war." (page 16) That is to say, Soviet military science, proletarian military science, and military science of people's democratic countries are the only military sciences that can stand on the great and abundant strength of the liberated people. This kind of military science is invincible in the world.

    The author exposes the essence of bourgeois military theory, one is the idealistic "commander-only" theory, and the other is the mechanistic "weapon-only" theory. Imperialists want to escape the people's aversion to and resistance to unjust wars, so they try to seek a permanent and unchanging "science" of victory. Since this "science" cannot be found in the correct laws of war, they have to blindly pursue it in operational forms, which are Clausewitz's "genius of command theory," Schlieffen's "Cannae tactics" (i.e., tactics of encircling the enemy with flanking maneuvers), Douhet's "air power wins" theory, the Nazi-fascist "blitzkrieg" tactics, and the American imperialist's "atomic warfare" delirium. The author sharply mocks the absurdity and powerlessness of these military ideas that have been separated from political issues. The author also points out: Although the lessons of history have made bourgeois military theorists understand the importance of economic and spiritual strength, they cannot analyze it from the social system, let alone solve it. Therefore, they can only explore in industrial technology organization and deceptive "morale" theories, which cannot change the fundamental inferiority of bourgeois military science. The author also quoted Lenin's words to ridicule how the bourgeoisie cannot use its own economic and military power: "As long as the issue involves the private property of capitalists and landlords, they forget everything they have ever said about loving the motherland and independence." (page 30)

    Military science and military art are different. The bourgeoisie believes that military science is nothing more than the forms and methods of military action, simply put, how to fight, which is actually military art rather than military science. Stalin pointed out that military science should also include the issue of the country's economic and spiritual strength. Therefore, to understand military science, one must not only know how to judge the enemy and our situation in direct combat, so as to determine the forms and methods of direct military action, but also must know and estimate the economic and spiritual strength of one's own country and the enemy's country. Soviet military art stands on this military science, so it can correctly strive to use the economic and spiritual strength of its own country, choose forms and methods in direct military action that are suitable for exerting this economic strength and spiritual strength, and can clearly utilize the enemy's economic and spiritual weaknesses. All of these are impossible for the bourgeoisie to do, and it is also impossible to do.

    Secondly, let me introduce "The Red Army - Army of Liberators." This book mainly explains the justice of the Red Army. The entire book has 35,000 words. Pages 1 to 26 analyze the great strength of the Red Army and its sources. Pages 27 to 42 describe the historical development of the Red Army. Pages 42 to 49 point out that the Red Army is an army of equality and unity of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Pages 49 to 58 analyze the spiritual qualities of the Red Army. Pages 59 and below explain how the Red Army absorbed the outstanding military traditions in Soviet history.

    The author first correctly emphasizes that the patriotism of the Soviet people is the main reason for the victory of the historical significance of the Red Army: "The Soviet people and their Red Army, who have shamelessly fulfilled their patriotic duties, played a decisive role in defeating fascist Germany and its allies." (page 3) The author also quoted the following passage from Stalin to illustrate this point: "The great sacrifices we have made for the freedom and independence of the motherland, the immeasurable poverty and suffering suffered by our people in the war, and the tense work dedicated to the motherland by the rear and the front have not been in vain, but have won complete victory over the enemy." (page 2)

    The victory of the Soviet anti-fascist war is of immeasurable value for ensuring lasting world peace. On the day of the victory over Hitler's Germany, Stalin clearly predicted this: "From now on, we can think that our country has eliminated the threat of German aggression from the West and Japanese aggression from the East. The peace that all countries in the world have long awaited has arrived." (page 3) "From then on, the great banner of national freedom and peace among nations will flutter over the skies of Europe." (page 2)

    This book analyzes how Hitler seized almost all of the productive forces, wealth and strategic raw materials of almost all of Europe, how he used the manpower of almost all of Europe and his own millions of well-trained fascist troops to launch an all-out attack on the Soviet state. However, the enemy completely failed, and the greatest force that could be gathered in imperialist history was completely defeated. People see that today's imperialists want to gather even a much smaller force in the dilapidated capitalist Europe is impossible.

    The defeat of Hitler's Germany means the fundamental failure of imperialist military theory, because this proves that: "What plays a decisive role in war is not those secondary factors such as sudden unexpected attacks, but the factors that always play a role: the consolidation of the rear, the morale of the army, the number and quality of divisions, the equipment of the army, and the organizational ability of the command personnel." (page 8) In this regard, the superiority of the Soviet military is incomparable to capitalist countries. The author briefly explained the origin of this advantage: "The invincible power of the Red Army has its deepest foundation in the history of our country's development in the past decade. The strength of the Red Army is the result of the birth of our new system—the Soviet system. The Red Army is the army of the most advanced, most progressive and most consolidated country in the world—the Soviet socialist country." (page 27)

    The author emphasizes that the Red Army is the people's army, and the bravery and wisdom of the Red Army is the crystallization of the bravery and wisdom of the broad masses of the people, just like a strong and brave person, whose strength is the result of the full use of all physiological and spiritual strength. "The unity and solidarity of the people and the Red Army is a great and invincible force. The Soviet people and the Red Army, inspired by a goal and guided by a will, are invincible." (page 34) Emphasizing the support of the broad masses of the people for the Red Army, emphasizing the concerted efforts of the front and the rear, the regular army and the guerrillas, emphasizing that the victory of the military front depends on the victory of the economic front, emphasizing that the Red Army can cultivate countless talented generals and brave soldiers from the broad masses of the people, this is a great and important reason for Soviet military science. On the contrary, the imperialist army is only the result of deceptive activities of a few conspirators. It is like a hemiplegic patient, who can only rely on some organs to carry out activities.

    Neither of these two books touches on the specific issues of conducting war. Readers who want to further study the strategic and tactical thinking of the Red Army can read some previously published books: "Soviet Military Science" translated by Yu Hong and published by Shidai Publishing House in January 1950, and "Tactical Principles of Mobile Warfare" translated by Wang Ziye and published by Xinhua Bookstore, both of which analyze actual combat experience. As for the history of Soviet army building, the book "A Brief History of the Soviet Army" published by Northeast Xinhua Bookstore is quite detailed and profound. Several important articles by Voroshilov should be read: his article "Stalin and the Construction of the Red Army" is included in "Learning from Stalin" published by Guanghua Publishing House, and the article "The Genius Commander of the Great Patriotic War" is included in "A Collection of Articles Celebrating Stalin's 70th Birthday" published by Xinhua Bookstore. Stalin's "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union" is the most important reading for studying this issue.

　　介绍两本苏联军事书
　　长冬
    《论苏联军事科学》恩·弗·普霍夫斯基少将著葆和甫译作家书屋一九五○年十二月初版  四二开本  基价二元九角
    《红军—解放者的军队》  费多谢也夫著  邹文奎译  人民出版社一九五一年一月初版  三二开本  定价二○○元                   
    二月二十三日是苏联红军节。当此世界和平民主阵营力量日益强大的时候，认识苏联红军的威力，能够给我们更多的信心；学习苏联建军的经验，更能够帮助我们的国防建设。上面两本是最近翻译出版的书，都值得推荐，特别是《论苏联军事科学》，写得非常精练深刻。这两本书内容各有重点，这里来分别作一介绍。
    先介绍《论苏联军事科学》，原书名为《论苏维埃军事科学比较资产阶级军事科学的优越性》。全书只二万三千字，却做到给专门读者读不嫌浅，给一般读者读不嫌深的地步。大体可分作三段，由文首至十六页是讨论苏联军事科学的本质的，一七页至四五页揭露资产阶级军事学的软弱无力，四六页至结束讨论军事科学与军事艺术的正确的关系。
    作者对苏联军事科学本质所下的两个最基本的判断，恰符合毛主席《实践论》中所指示的两个基本点，这就是：一、军事科学是由实践跟经验来考验、发展的；二、军事科学是有阶级性的、党性的。关于第一点，本书仅作了最一般的阐释：“要想正确地了解我们这个时代的军事科学的本质，这就首先要弄清楚广大人民群众在战争中的作用问题，并且根据他们的这种作用而建立军事艺术。”（书八页）作者主要是详细说明了军事科学的阶级性：“战争这种社会现象，是阶级社会所固有的东西”，战争是用暴力手段进行的政治。因此，“任何一种军事理论都是阶级理论”，军事科学的威力程度，“是以武装部队为那一个阶级的利益服务而定的”。（书七页）
    然后作者分析现代的战争是由各国人民进行的，所以，“若想正确地了解现代军事科学的本质，这就是先要了解广大人民群众在现代战争中的巨大作用，了解人民自己的利益在这种战争中的意义”（书七页）。“真正的军事科学不能不估计到人民对战争目的所抱态度、不能不估计到人民为了达成胜利愿意供献全部精力和整个生命之重要意义”。
    作者指出资产阶级无法接受这种军事科学的基本规律，因为帝国主义所准备进行的战争是非正义的、侵略的、不符合人民利益的。于是，它们“就制订尽量少依靠于人民群众的进行战争的形式与方法。资产阶级军事理论的这种与现代军事科学原则本身相矛盾的趋向，在对强敌作战上是不能获得成功的，因为这种形式与方法，很少甚或根本不符合于机器时代战争的条件与性质的。”（书九页）自然，不能说资产阶级军事理论不能制定使用现代器材威力的武装斗争形式与方法，但是根据第二次世界大战的经验，“证明了资产阶级的军事科学，不能相当充分地去利用那些现代生产力与军事技术发展的水平所创造出来的军事上及经济上的力量……。武装部队战斗能力如何，武装部队是否善于尽量利用现代斗争武器及工具的全部威力，以及武装部队所倚靠的后方是否巩固，这在现在尤其甚于任何时期，是要以该国的社会制度，要以战争目的是否符合人民利益而定。”资本主义制度固有的、内在的社会及经济的矛盾，使它不能充分利用军事及经济力量，这，“只要还存在着资产阶级制度，就是不能消灭的。现代帝国主义国家，首先是美国，其腐朽的资产阶级意识形态之反动的帝国主义的本质，使他们的军事理论剥掉科学上的根据，使这种理论不能符合于机器时代战争的素质与性质。”（书十一页）
    于是作者指出：“苏维埃的军事科学，在其本质上既是党性的，也就成了进步的军事科学，这因为它是为苏维埃社会主义国家的利益，为最进步的社会制度的利益而服务的。……苏维埃的军事科学，在最正义的战争中——在苏维埃社会主义国家对帝国主义侵略者的战争中，制定着并确定着制胜的途径。”（书十三页）“斯大林同志基于马列主义创建了苏维埃的军事科学，这种军事科学的出发点，不仅必须研究现代进行战争、战役与会战之方法与工具，而且也要基于正确地了解经济及精神的潜力，基于彻底利用苏维埃社会主义国家的经济力量，苏维埃人民精神上政治上的统一性，以及对于战胜帝国主义侵略者之不屈不挠的意志。”（书十五页）“……苏维埃的军事科学是唯一出发于正确了解现代战争中的不仅军事的而且是经济与精神的潜力之作用与意识的、出发于正确了解那些决定战争发展与结局的物质与精神因素之本质的军事科学。”（书十六页）这就是说，苏维埃军事科学，无产阶级军事科学，人民民主国家的军事科学，是唯一能够立足于那解放了的人民的伟大充沛力量之上的军事科学，这种军事科学，是无敌于天下的。
    作者揭露资产阶级军事理论的实质，其一是唯统帅论的唯心主义，其二是唯武器论的机械主义。帝国主义者想逃避开人民对于非正义战争的厌恶和反抗，就企图去寻求一种永恒不变的制胜“科学”，这种“科学”既不能从战争的正确规律中去找，就只好在作战形式上去盲目追求，这就是克劳塞维茨的“统帅天才论”，史里芬的“堪尼战术论”（即以侧翼机动包围敌人的战术），杜黑的“空军制胜论”，德日意法西斯的“闪电”战术，以及美帝国主义的“原子战争”呓语。作者尖锐地嘲笑了这些脱离开了政治问题的军事思想的荒谬与无力。作者也指出：虽然历史的教训使资产阶级军事理论家懂得经济和精神力量的重要性，但他们不能从社会制度上来分析，更不能加以解决，因此只能在工业技术组织及欺骗性的“士气”理论上去探讨，而这是不能改变资产阶级军事科学的根本劣势的。作者又引了列宁的话，来嘲笑资产阶级如何不能运用本身的经济力量和军事力量：“只要问题一涉及资本家及地主的私有财产，那他们就忘却一切自己曾经说过的关于热爱祖国及独立的话了。”（书三○页）
    军事科学和军事艺术是不同的。资产阶级认为军事科学不过是军事行动的形式与方法，简单地说，就是怎样打仗，这其实是军事艺术而不是军事科学。斯大林指出，军事科学还应包括国家的经济及精神力量的问题。因此，要认识军事科学，不仅要知道判断直接作战中的敌我情况，从而决定直接军事行动的形式与方法，而且还必须知道和估计到本国和敌国的经济和精神力量。苏维埃军事艺术，立足于这种军事科学之上，因此就能够正确地争取使用本国经济的和精神的力量，选择适合于发挥这种经济力量和精神力量的直接军事行动中的形式和方法，并且能够明确地利用敌人的经济的和精神的弱点。所有这些，都是资产阶级无法做到，而且也不可能做到的。
    其次，介绍《红军——解放者的军队》。本书主要在说明红军的正义性。全书三万五千字，由首页至二六页分析红军的伟大力量及其来源，二七至四二页说明红军的历史发展，四二至四九页指出红军是苏联各族人民的平等和团结的军队，四九至五八页分析红军的精神特质，五九页以下说明红军如何吸收苏联历史上的优秀军事传统。
    作者首先正确地强调苏联人民的爱国主义是造成红军历史意义的胜利的主要原因：“毫无愧色的完成了自己的爱国天职的苏联人民和他们的红军，在战胜法西斯德国及其同盟者当中，起了决定的作用。”（书三页）作者又引了斯大林的下面一段话来说明这点：“我们为了祖国的自由与独立所作的巨大牺牲，我国人民在战争过程中所遭受的无可估量的穷困与痛苦，后方与前线奉献给祖国的紧张工作，并没有落空，而是因之博得对敌人的完全胜利。”（书二页）
    苏联反法西斯战争的胜利对于保证世界持久和平，是有着无可估量的价值的。在刚刚战胜希特勒德国之日，斯大林就明确地预示了这一点：“从现在起，我们能够认为我国已解除了西方德国侵略与东方日本侵略的威胁了。全世界各国长久期待的和平已经到来了。”（书三页）“此后，各民族自由与各民族间和平的伟大旗帜，将飘扬于欧洲的上空。”（书二页）
    本书分析了希特勒如何攫取了几乎整个欧洲所有的生产力、财富和战略原料，如何利用几乎整个欧洲的人力以及其本国的久经训练的数百万法西斯军队，倾巢向苏维埃国家进攻。然而敌人完全失败了，这个在帝国主义历史中所可能集聚起来的最大的力量，是彻底被打垮了。人们看到，今天的帝国主义者，要想在残破的资本主义的欧洲集聚即使规模要小得多的力量，也是不可能了。
    希特勒德国的失败，是意味着帝国主义军事理论的根本失败，因为这证明了：在战争中“起决定作用的，不是那些附属的突然的不意袭击之类的因素，而是经常起作用的因素：后方的巩固，军队的士气，师的数量和质量，军队的装备，指挥人员的组织能力。”（书八页）在这方面，苏联军事的优势，是资本主义国家所无法比较的。作者简括地说明了这种优势的由来：“红军的战胜一切的力量，在最近十年以来的我国发展史中，是有其最深刻的基础的。红军的强大，乃是我国新制度——苏维埃制度诞生的结果。红军是世界上最先进、最进步和最巩固的国家——苏维埃社会主义国家的军队。”（书二七页）
    作者强调了红军是人民的军队，红军的勇敢和智慧是广大人民的勇敢和智慧的结晶，好像一个强壮勇武的人，他的力量是全部生理的、精神的力量充分运用的结果。“人民和红军的一致和团结，乃是伟大的、不可被克服的力量。为一个目标所鼓舞、被一个意志所指导的苏维埃人民和红军，乃是不可被战胜的。”（书三四页）强调广大人民对红军的支援，强调前线和后方、正规军与游击队的一致的努力，强调军事战线的胜利依靠经济战线的胜利，强调红军能从广大人民群众中培养出无数天才的将领和勇敢的战士，这是苏联军事科学的伟大的重要原因。相反，帝国主义的军队，只是少数阴谋家欺骗性活动的结果，它好像一个半身不遂的病人，只能依赖部分器官进行活动。
    这两本书都没有接触到进行战争的具体问题，读者要深入研究红军的战略战术思想，可以阅读以前出版的一些书：于洪译、时代出版社一九五○年一月出版的《苏联的军事科学》和王子野译、新华书店出版的《运动战的战术原则》，都是分析实战经验的。关于苏联建军史的，东北新华书店出版的《苏军简史》一书，颇为详明深刻。伏罗希洛夫有几篇重要文章应该一读：他的《斯大林与红军建设》一文编入光华出版社出版的《向斯大林学习》一书中，《伟大卫国战争的天才统帅》一文编入新华书店出版的《庆祝斯大林七十寿辰文集》一书中。斯大林的《论苏联伟大卫国战争》，更是研究这个问题的最主要的读物。
