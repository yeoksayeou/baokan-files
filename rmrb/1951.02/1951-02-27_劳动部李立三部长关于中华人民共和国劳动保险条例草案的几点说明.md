Premier, esteemed members:

　　The draft of the Labor Insurance Regulations has been in the drafting process for nearly a year. First, the drafting committee, composed of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, drafted a preliminary draft based on Article 32 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the demands and opinions of workers across the country, and the actual conditions of current factories and enterprises. After that, it convened relevant agencies and trade union organizations to conduct repeated research, and after more than twenty revisions, it was made into a formal draft and submitted to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for review. After obtaining their consent, it was submitted to the Government Administration Council for review. The 56th Government Affairs Conference on October 27, 1950, discussed and preliminarily approved it, and decided to publish the draft in newspapers to solicit opinions from the people across the country. Over the past three months, trade union organizations, workers, management agencies of factories and enterprises, the business community, people's organizations, and labor administrative agencies at all levels across the country have launched heated discussions. As of the end of January, a total of 141 written opinions have been received from various regions. All these written opinions, in addition to proposing revisions to individual articles, unanimously expressed support for the spirit and basic principles of the entire regulation. Workers across the country warmly welcomed it, feeling that when the country's financial and economic situation has just begun to improve, the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea is underway, and various difficulties have not been completely overcome, the implementation of labor insurance provides certain subsidies, pensions, and relief for the most painful and unsolvable problems in workers' lives, such as birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability, demonstrating how much the People's Government cares about the suffering and difficulties of workers. Some workers said at discussion meetings: "Factories have always only provided for the young, not the old. When you are young and strong, they want you to work. When you are old and unable to work, they tell you to get lost. Where has there ever been a case of receiving a pension every year when you get old?" Some workers, based on their own experience, said: "My father was a laborer on the railway and was crushed to death by a train. We couldn't afford a coffin. My mother took me to the bureau to kowtow and beg, and only then did we get a few wooden planks to make a coffin. There was not even half a cent of compensation." A female worker said: "I worked for five years, entered and left the factory four times. I was fired after giving birth, and came back after the child died. Now, when I give birth, I have eight weeks of leave with full pay, and there is also a maternity subsidy. I never even dreamed of such a thing." Indeed, when workers compare their past lives with the current labor insurance regulations, they shout slogans such as "Long live the People's Government!" and "Chairman Mao is truly our savior!" This is entirely natural. This also illustrates the enormous political significance of the promulgation of this regulation.
　　The opinions put forward by various regions have been carefully studied, and many good suggestions have been adopted into the revised draft. Many suggestions to increase various labor insurance benefits, if appropriate, have been adopted. Some suggestions were too high, and some, although generally reasonable, are currently difficult or impossible to achieve due to the economic situation and must wait until China's economy has further developed before they can be implemented. In addition, some suggestions to lower several labor insurance benefits cannot be adopted because they would harm the necessary guarantees for workers' lives. Now, I will make a brief explanation of several relatively important issues:

　One. Regarding the Scope of Application

　　Article 1 of the draft stipulates that the objects of labor insurance include all employed laborers. However, given the current economic conditions and the lack of experience in such a major and complex task, we can only adopt a key pilot approach for now, starting with factories and mines with more than 100 workers and staff, and several industrial sectors with nationally unified administrative management agencies and relatively sound industrial trade union organizations. Because factories with more than 100 people have relatively sound administrative and trade union organizations, they are easier to organize and manage. Although the number of factories is less than those with fewer than 100 people, the number of people included is several times greater. Taking Shanghai as an example, among the city's sixteen industries, there are a total of 5,315 factories with a total of 415,596 people, of which factories with more than 100 people account for only 14 percent, while the number of employees accounts for more than 80 percent of the total (333,400 people). At the same time, the draft regulations stipulate that enterprises not within the scope of Article 2 can still stipulate it in the collective contract in accordance with the principles of the draft if the administrative side or the capital side and the trade union organization both agree to implement labor insurance through consultation. We deeply know that the lives of workers in small factories and shops are even more difficult and in greater need of protection, but because they are too scattered and disorganized, it is really impossible to quickly and effectively organize them and implement labor insurance. After a certain period, when large factories and enterprises have achieved results and gained experience, and trade union organizations have become sound, then it can be gradually extended to these small factories and enterprises. As for the public education personnel of government administrative agencies and educational institutions, as well as other institutional personnel not included in the scope of Article 2, they are also in urgent need of labor insurance, but based on the current national financial situation and the urgent task of concentrating financial resources on national defense construction, it is necessary to temporarily not implement it, and it can be gradually implemented after the national financial and economic situation continues to improve in the future. This is also completely in line with the spirit of Article 32 of the Common Program, which stipulates the gradual implementation of the labor insurance system. In addition, the original draft Article 2, paragraph B, regarding the scope of application, included banks. After careful research, it was felt that during the current pilot period, it should be limited to industrial and mining transportation enterprises for the time being, because the workers and staff in industrial and mining transportation enterprises work harder and have lower wages than the workers and staff in banks, and they are in greater need of labor insurance, so the word "banks" in paragraph B has been crossed out. We ask the workers and staff in banks to wait a little longer, and when it is gradually extended in the future, they will of course enjoy the same benefits as the trade, tax, and other agency staff.
    Another opinion advocates learning from the Northeast and first implementing it in state-owned enterprises and then extending it to private enterprises. However, because the situation in the interior is different from that in the Northeast, in many areas, the proportion of private enterprises is greater than that of public enterprises, and there are many large enterprises with a large number of employees. If it is implemented only in public enterprises, it is obviously unfair.

　Two. Collection and Use of Labor Insurance Funds

　　The draft stipulates that all expenses of labor insurance shall be borne by the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprise implementing labor insurance, and workers and staff shall not pay any fees. This is completely different from the methods of capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, labor insurance is based on the so-called capitalist principle of "sharing risks," and all or most of the expenses are borne by the workers and staff themselves, which actually becomes a means of intensifying the exploitation of the working class. For example, the United States extracted 4.3 billion US dollars in insurance premiums from workers from 1939 to 1946, but only paid out more than 800 million US dollars to workers. The remaining tens of billions of US dollars have become funds for banks to turn around and make profits, which is the best proof.
    The draft stipulates that labor insurance expenses are divided into two parts: one part is paid directly by the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprise, and the other part is allocated by the administrative side or the capital side at 3 percent of the total wage bill to the trade union organization for handling. The main reason for this provision is to promote the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprise to pay attention to labor protection work. Because the amount of medical expenses and sick leave wages depends on the quality of the enterprise's safety and health work, stipulating that these expenses are directly paid by the enterprise will require the enterprise to care about the health of workers and actively strengthen safety and health equipment in order to reduce this expense. This will also provide powerful assistance to the trade union in its struggle to reduce the injury and illness rates of workers and staff.
　　Of the 3 percent labor insurance fund, 70 percent is earmarked for paying for labor insurance benefits enjoyed by employees, and 30 percent is used as a general fund for the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to coordinate collective labor insurance programs. According to the experience of the Northeast over the past year, collective labor insurance programs have played a significant role in preventing employee disease and death and in encouraging employee production enthusiasm. However, each collective labor insurance program requires a large amount of funding, which cannot be undertaken by each enterprise alone, so the All-China Federation of Trade Unions must concentrate its efforts to coordinate.

　Three. Labor Insurance Benefits

　　The standard for paying labor insurance benefits is mainly based on the actual needs and minimum living guarantee of workers, with the goal of "protecting the physical health of employed laborers and alleviating special difficulties in their lives" as much as possible. For example, disability compensation is based on the actual impact on life after disability to determine the amount of disability compensation, and dependent relatives' compensation is based on the number of dependent relatives to determine the amount, and the payment of sickness allowance has no time limit. These are obvious examples. This is completely different from the so-called insurance in capitalist countries. The standards and conditions for receiving insurance benefits in capitalist countries are entirely determined according to the principle of "commercial transactions." For example, if a worker loses an eye or a leg, compensation is given according to the prescribed price, regardless of the actual needs of the worker. For example, to receive sickness insurance benefits, it depends on the amount of insurance premiums paid by the insured to determine the amount, and even stipulates that those who have not paid insurance premiums for a certain number of years will not receive insurance benefits.
　　On the other hand, from the perspective of the current overall national situation, not only have economic difficulties not been completely overcome, but the People's Liberation War has not yet completely ended, and millions of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the majority of civil servants in state organs are still living an extremely difficult supply system or low-salary system life. Therefore, the labor insurance benefits for workers and staff in industrial and mining transportation enterprises cannot and should not be set too high. The various standards stipulated in the current draft are naturally lower than the labor insurance standards in the Soviet Union or other new democratic countries, but they are still higher than those in capitalist countries compared. For example, taking the much-hyped so-called "cradle to grave" social security system of 1948 in the United Kingdom as an example, its sickness allowance is 26 shillings per week. According to the statistics of 1949, the average income of British workers was 117 shillings and six pence per week, so the sickness allowance of 26 shillings per week is only 22 percent of the wage, which is more than half less than our stipulated maximum.
　　In addition to the principle of guaranteeing the minimum living needs of workers, labor insurance benefits also take into account the need to develop production. For example, sickness insurance provides different benefits based on the length of service in the enterprise. For example, old-age insurance stipulates that only those who have been employed in the enterprise for more than ten years can enjoy it. This is to reduce worker turnover and enable workers to work in a factory for a long time, accumulate experience, and improve production technology and skills, which is of great significance for improving production and increasing production. For example, labor models who have made special contributions to the enterprise are given more favorable treatment to encourage workers' enthusiasm for labor, which is also very beneficial to the development of production. At the same time, combat heroes who are transferred to work in enterprises are given the same excellent treatment as labor models. This is the due reward of the people's country for those who have contributed to the revolution.
　　In addition, the draft stipulates that the labor insurance benefits enjoyed by workers who have not joined the trade union will be lower than those of trade union members. This is to encourage workers to actively participate in the trade union in order to promote the rapid development of trade union organizations and make the trade union a strong pillar of the People's Government. In order to encourage the people to organize, give organized masses more preferential treatment, and make China a rapidly organized country, this is completely in line with the principles of new democracy and the spirit of the Common Program.

　Four. Implementation and Supervision of Labor Insurance

　　The draft stipulates that labor insurance business is implemented by the trade union and supervised by the government labor administrative agency. Because the trade union is the organization of the workers themselves, it is most able to take care of the lives of workers. At the same time, labor insurance is a very complex task, and to do this work well, we must rely on the direct participation and supervision of the masses. Therefore, it is most appropriate for the trade union to undertake it. In capitalist countries, labor insurance work is mainly handled by bureaucratic agencies or semi-commercial agencies established by the government, which often employs a large number of bureaucrats of the ruling class. According to calculations in Britain and the United States, this expense accounts for 15 to 20 percent of the total insurance premiums, which is actually an exploitation of the insured. Handling by trade union organizations can greatly save this expense. However, trade union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots trade union organizations, should deeply understand that running labor insurance is a very complex and arduous task, a huge organizational work. They must carefully study specific methods, carry out thorough preparations, and pay special attention to publicity and explanation to the masses in order to obtain the help and supervision of the masses in order to do this work well. If they are careless, do not make thorough plans, do not strictly follow the regulations, and arbitrarily spend labor insurance funds, or even engage in corruption and waste, as is currently the case in individual factories, then a cause that was originally enthusiastically supported by the broad masses will backfire and cause dissatisfaction among the broad masses of workers. This is what trade union organizations at all levels should pay serious attention to. Personnel at all levels handling labor insurance business must treat their business with the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and being selfless.
　　The draft stipulates that the labor administrative agencies of the people's governments at all levels are the supervisory agencies for labor insurance business. In order to supervise and help the trade union do a good job in labor insurance, implement the regulations, and regularly check whether the administrative side or the capital side of the enterprise and the trade union organization are handling matters in accordance with the regulations, and promptly discover and solve problems, is an important condition for the smooth progress of the labor insurance business. Labor administrative agencies at all levels must earnestly fulfill this important responsibility.

　　　※　　　　※　　　※
　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class began to fight for the implementation of labor insurance as early as the labor legislation movement held in 1922. In the nearly thirty years of heroic struggle, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we finally united the people of the whole country and carried out unyielding and arduous struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved victory on a national scale, and established a people's regime led by the working class. Only then did we obtain the necessary conditions for the implementation of national labor insurance. Therefore, the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations is undoubtedly a major revolutionary victory achieved by the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, and it is something worthy of enthusiastic celebration by all working people.

　　In the Northeast, after the implementation of labor insurance in public enterprises, the difficulties of employees' birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability have been properly taken care of, and their enthusiasm for production has doubled, playing a significant role in the recovery and development of production. This shows that the implementation of labor insurance is not only beneficial to the working class but also beneficial to all the people. We request that the Government Affairs Council of the Central People's Government formally approve this Labor Insurance Regulation. We believe that the promulgation and implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulation will inevitably further enhance the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people to fight for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect the country and defend our homes, and to fight for building a strong national defense force and a strong economic force.

　　劳动部李立三部长关于中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案的几点说明
    总理、各位委员：
    劳动保险条例草案经过将近一年时间的起草过程，首先由中央人民政府劳动部与中华全国总工会组成的起草委员会根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三十二条的规定及全国各地职工的要求与意见和目前工厂企业的实际情况，拟定初步草案之后，召集有关机关及工会组织进行反复研究，修改了二十余次之多，才作成正式草案，送请中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会及政务院财政经济委员会审查，得到同意后，才提交政务院审核。一九五零年十月二十七日第五十六次政务会议作了讨论，初步通过，并决定将草案先在报上发表，征求全国人民的意见。三个月来，全国各地工会组织、工人群众、工厂企业的管理机关、工商界、人民团体及各级人民政府劳动行政机关都展开了热烈的讨论，截至一月底止，共收到各地寄来的意见书一百四十一件。所有这些意见书，除对个别条文提出修改意见外，对整个条例的精神和基本原则的办法都一致表示拥护。各地工人群众更是非常热烈欢迎，觉得当国家财政经济状况刚刚开始好转，抗美援朝的斗争正在开展，各种困难尚未完全克服的时候，就举办劳动保险，使工人生活中最感痛苦而无法解决的生、老、病、死、伤、残等问题都获得了一定的补助、抚恤和救济，可见人民政府是如何关心工人的疾苦和困难。有些工人在讨论会议上发言说：“从来工厂都是养少不养老，年轻力壮，要你干活，老了干不动了就叫你滚蛋，那里有过老了每年发给养老金的事。”有的工人根据自己的经验说：“我的父亲在铁路上当小工，被火车压死了，买不起棺材，母亲带着我到局里叩头求告，才求得几块木板做棺材，半个钱的抚恤也没有。”有一个女工说：“我做了五年工，四次出厂进厂，生了孩子滚蛋，孩子死了再来。现在生了孩子有八星期假期，照发工资，还有生育补助费，真是做梦也没有梦到的事。”真的，工人们把他们过去的生活，与现在的劳动保险条例对照起来的时候，就喊着人民政府万岁，毛主席真是我们的救星的口号，完全是很自然的。这也就说明这个条例的颁布有如何巨大的政治意义。
    各地对条例所提出的意见，经过了仔细研究，有许多好的建议，已采纳到修正草案中。有不少主张提高各项劳动保险待遇的建议，提得恰当的都已经采纳了，有些提得太高，有些虽然一般合理，却是目前经济情况所难以做到或不能做到的，而必须等待将来中国经济有了进一步的发展之后才能实行。另外有些主张降低几项劳动保险待遇的建议，又因要损害到工人生活的必要保障，所以也不能采纳。现在提出几个比较重要的问题，作一简单的说明：
　一、关于适用范围
    草案第一条规定劳动保险的对象，是包括所有雇佣劳动者。但依目前经济条件，及对这种重大复杂工作缺乏经验的情况，目前只能采取重点试行办法，先从工人职员人数在百人以上的工厂矿场及有全国统一的行政管理机构与比较健全的产业工会组织的几个产业部门着手试办。因为百人以上工厂，无论行政与工会组织都比较健全，比较容易举办，容易管理。工厂的数目，虽比百人以下的少，但包括的人数却多了几倍。以上海为例，在全市十六个行业中，共有工厂五三一五家，共计四一五五九六人，其中百人以上的工厂只占百分之十四，而职工人数却占总数百分之八十以上（三三三、四○○人）。同时条例草案上规定了不属于第二条范围的企业，如果行政方面或资方与工会组织双方协商，同意实行劳动保险，仍然可以按照草案的原则，在集体合同内规定之。我们深深知道小工厂商店的工人生活更苦，更需要保障，但因为过于分散、零乱，实在无法迅速有效地组织起来，实施劳动保险。过了一定时期，各大工厂企业举办有了成绩，取得了经验，工会组织又已健全起来，那时即可逐渐推广到这些小工厂企业中去。至于政府行政机关、教育机关的公教人员以及未包括在第二条范围内的其他机关人员对于劳动保险也是迫切需要的，但根据目前国家财政状况，及需要集中财力进行国防建设的紧迫任务，只好暂不实行，俟将来国家财政经济状况继续好转以后，当可逐渐实行。这也是与共同纲领第三十二条规定逐步实行劳动保险制度的精神，完全符合的。此外，在原来草案第二条乙款关于适用范围中，包括有银行在内，经过仔细研究后，觉得在目前试行时期，应暂以工矿交通企业为限，因工矿交通企业中的职工比之银行的职工，工作重些，工资低些，需要劳动保险，也就更迫切些，所以将乙款中的银行二字勾去了。请求银行中的工人职员，再等待一些时候，俟将来逐渐推广时，当然可与贸易、税务及其他机关工作人员同样享受。
    另有一种意见，主张仿照东北办法，先从国营企业试办，然后推广到私营企业。但由于关内情况与东北不同，在许多地区，私营企业的比重都大过公营企业，而且其中有不少雇佣工人很多的大企业，如果单在公营企业中实行，显然是不公平的。
　二、劳动保险金的征集与使用
    草案规定劳动保险的各项费用，全部由实行劳动保险的企业行政方面或资方负担，工人职员不缴纳任何费用，这与资本主义国家的办法是完全不同的。在资本主义国家中的劳动保险根据所谓“分担危险”的资本主义原则，全部或大部费用均由工人职员自己负担，实际成为加重剥削工人阶级的手段。例如美国从一九三九年至一九四六年从工人身上抽取了四十三万万美元的保险金，而支付给工人的只有八万万多美元，余下几十万万美元都成了银行周转谋利的资金，便是最好的证明。
    草案规定劳动保险费用，划分为两部分，一部分由企业行政方面或资方直接支付，一部分由行政方面或资方按全部工资总额百分之三拨交经费给工会组织办理。这样规定的主要理由，是为了促使企业行政方面或资方重视劳动保护工作。因为医药费和病伤假期工资等费用支出数额的多寡，是由企业对于安全卫生工作办理的好坏来决定的，把这些费用规定由企业直接开支，企业为了减少这笔支出，就必须关心工人的健康，积极加强安全卫生设备。从而使工会在为减少工人与职员的伤病率的斗争上，也得到了有力的帮助。
    在百分之三的劳动保险金中，除划出百分之七十作为支付职工个人享受劳动保险待遇之用外，百分之三十作为总基金，由中华全国总工会统筹举办集体劳动保险事业。根据东北一年来的经验，集体劳动保险事业在预防职工的疾病死亡上，在鼓舞职工的生产热情上，都起了重大的作用。但每个集体劳动保险事业，都需要花费很大的资金，不是每一个企业所能单独举办的，所以必须由全国总工会集中力量来统筹举办。
　三、劳动保险待遇
    劳动保险待遇支付的标准，主要是从工人的实际需要与最低生活保障出发，以尽可能作到“保护雇佣劳动者的身体健康，并减轻其生活中的特殊困难”为目的。如残废抚恤费系根据残废后对生活的实际影响，来决定残废抚恤费的数额，供养直系亲属抚恤费是根据被供养直系亲属的人数而决定数额的多寡，疾病补助费的支付，并无时间限制，这些都是明显的例子。这与资本主义国家的所谓保险，完全不同。资本主义国家保险待遇的标准，领取待遇的条件，是完全根据“商业交易”原则来确定的，例如工人瞎了一只眼睛或丢了一只腿，按规定的价格，给予赔偿，丝毫不管工人的实际需要。例如领取疾病保险费，要看保险人缴纳保险金的多寡来决定数额，甚至规定缴纳保险金未满一定年限者，不发保险费。
    另一方面，从目前整个国家情况看来，不仅经济困难，尚未完全克服，而且人民解放战争尚未完全结束，几百万人民解放军指挥员和战斗员，与国家机关的多数公务人员还过着异常艰苦的供给制或低薪制生活，因此对于工矿交通企业中职工的劳动保险待遇，不可能，也不应当定得太高。现在草案中规定的各项标准较之苏联或其他新民主主义国家的劳动保险标准，自然要低些，但与资本主义国家相较，则还是要比他们高。例如就英国大吹大擂的所谓“自摇篮至坟墓”的一九四八年社会安全制度而论，其疾病补助金为每周二十六先令，根据一九四九年统计，英国工人的平均收入每周为一一七先令六辨士，那么每周二十六先令的疾病补助金只有工资的百分之二十二，比我们规定的最高额少了一倍以上。
    劳动保险待遇，除根据保障工人最低生活需要的原则外，同时也照顾到发展生产的需要。如疾病保险按本企业工龄长短而规定不同的待遇。如养老保险，规定必须有本企业工龄十年以上者，始能享受，这是为了减少工人流动性，使工人长期在一个工厂中工作，累积经验，提高生产技术与熟练程度，这是对改进生产、提高生产有非常重大意义的。又如对企业有特殊贡献的劳动模范，给予较优的待遇，以鼓励工人的劳动热情，这也是对发展生产非常有利的。同时对于转入企业工作的战斗英雄，给与劳动模范同样优异待遇，这是人民国家对于革命有功的人应有的酬答。
    此外草案规定，没有加入工会的工人所享受的某几项劳动保险待遇，要比工会会员低些，这是为了鼓励工人积极参加工会，以推动工会组织迅速发展，使工会成为人民政府的坚强支柱。为了鼓励人民组织起来，给有组织的群众以比较优异的待遇，使中国迅速成为有组织的国家，这是完全符合于新民主主义的原则与共同纲领的精神的。
　四、劳动保险的执行与监督
    劳动保险业务，草案规定由工会执行，由政府劳动行政机关监督。因为工会是工人群众自己的组织，它是最能照顾工人生活的。同时劳动保险是相当复杂的工作，要做好这个工作，必须依靠群众的直接参加和监督。因此由工会担任最为适宜。在资本主义国家中，劳动保险工作，主要是由政府设立的官僚机关或半营业的机关来办理，经常豢养着大批统治阶级的官僚，这一笔费用，根据英美的计算，要占去保险金总额百分之十五至二十之多，这实际是对被保险者的剥削。由工会组织办理，便可大大节省这笔费用。但各级工会组织，特别是工会基层组织，应当深切了解，举办劳动保险是一个非常复杂而繁重的任务，是一个巨大的组织工作，必须细心研究具体作法，进行周密的准备工作，特别注意对群众的宣传解释，以取得群众的帮助和监督，才能把这一工作做好。如果粗枝大叶，不作周密的计划，不切实按条例办事，而任意开支劳动保险经费，甚至发生贪污浪费，如现在个别工厂已有的现象，那么，本来一件为广大群众所热烈拥护的事业，会适得其反，引起广大工人群众的不满。这是各级工会组织应当严重注意的。各级办理劳动保险事业的人员必须有全心全意为人民服务和大公无私的精神来对待自己的业务。
    草案规定各级人民政府劳动行政机关为劳动保险业务的监督机关，政府为了监督和帮助工会做好劳动保险工作，贯彻条例的执行，经常检查企业行政方面或资方与工会组织，是否都按照条例的规定办理，及时地发现问题、解决问题，是使劳动保险事业顺利进行的重要条件。各级劳动行政机关必须切实履行这个重大的责任。
    ※　　    ※　　  ※
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下，远在一九二二年举行劳动立法运动的时候就开始为争取实行劳动保险而奋斗。在将近三十年英勇斗争的过程中，由于获得了毛主席的英明领导，才终于团结了全国人民，与帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行百折不挠的坚苦斗争，取得了全国范围的胜利，建立了以工人阶级为领导的人民政权，这才获得了实行全国劳动保险的必要条件。所以劳动保险条例的颁布，无疑的是中国工人阶级与全国人民所获得的一个重大的革命胜利果实，是值得全体劳动人民热烈庆祝的事。
    在东北，公营企业实行劳动保险以后，由于职工的生、老、病、死、伤、残等困难问题都得到了适当的照顾，他们的生产热情也就加倍提高，在生产的恢复和发展上，起了重大的推进作用。这就说明，实行劳动保险，不仅对工人阶级有利，而且对于全体人民也有利。我们请求中央人民政府政务院政务会议正式通过这个劳动保险条例，相信劳动保险条例的公布施行，必然会更进一步地提高广大劳动人民的积极性，为抗美援朝保家卫国而斗争，为建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量而斗争。
