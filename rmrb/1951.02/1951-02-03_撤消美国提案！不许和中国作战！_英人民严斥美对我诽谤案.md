Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: The London Workers Daily reported that the Britain-China Friendship Association and the British Peace Committee issued statements on the 1st, calling on the British people to rise up against the British government's act of capitulation in supporting the U.S. slander case against China in the United Nations.

The Britain-China Friendship Association stated: "We believe that the government's retreat to support the U.S. proposal to condemn China as an aggressor means expanding hostile actions against China. We call on all groups and members who have joined this association to immediately protest to the Prime Minister and their respective elected members of Parliament." The British Peace Committee, in a similar appeal, asked everyone to pay attention to the serious warning from Indian representative Rau, who said: Because of this action against China, "the world is heading towards disaster."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: The London Workers Daily published an editorial on the 1st stating: "The British government's vote in favor of the U.S. proposal to condemn China as an 'aggressor' is a step that will eliminate the possibility of resolving the Korean issue through peaceful negotiations. Ignoring the Chinese People's Government's clear warning that condemning China as an aggressor would undermine hopes for a peaceful resolution, the British government spinelessly succumbed to the pressure exerted by the U.S. on this issue; this encourages the U.S. to frantically move towards war against China."

The newspaper stated: "As the General Assembly violates the Charter and passes this proposal, the U.S. will disregard the Security Council and continue to work towards sanctions and eventual war."

The newspaper pointed out: "No British person should harbor any illusions about the seriousness of the situation that has now been created."

The newspaper pointed out: "This is not a matter of moral concern" because "the United Nations has no moral standing on the Korean issue." "What facilitated this decision was merely shameless, arrogant American blackmail." "The American proposal is not only opposed by the Soviet Union, but also by India and Burma. This proposal has not received the support of any Asian country. It is opposed by the majority of mankind."

The newspaper concluded by issuing a call to the people: "Everyone who opposes war with China, now is the time to act! Repeal the U.S. proposal! Do not support American lunatics! No war with China! Immediately resolve the issue through negotiations in accordance with the methods proposed by India, China, and the Soviet Union!"

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: TASS, London, February 2nd: The Times received a letter from thirty-one staff members of the University of Birmingham, which stated: "Many British people support a policy of negotiation on the Korean issue, rather than advocating sanctions. They demand that the government reach a compromise agreement on this issue, as well as on the issue of German rearmament and the Four-Power Conference."

The Times also received a letter from professors and lecturers at Oxford University, who wrote: "If we rearm Germany, we will be openly disregarding the Potsdam Agreement. Such action would subject us to blame for being more concerned with establishing a so-called 'situation of strength' than with maintaining respect for diplomatic moral standards."

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: TASS, London, January 27th: British newspapers, in commenting on the discussion of the Korean issue in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, pointed out the intensification of Anglo-American contradictions.

The New Statesman wrote: Currently, in Anglo-American relations, "there is a most serious rift." In discussing Attlee's statement in the House of Commons on the China issue, the journal fully agreed with the speech, except for Attlee's expression that Britain was prepared to accept the part of the American proposal that condemned China. The journal also stated that no matter how great the danger, abandoning wisdom in order to express false unity with the Americans would lead to disaster. The Daily Herald, the News Chronicle, the Daily Express, and the Daily Mail all published brief reports from American newspapers reflecting the dissatisfaction of American imperialists with Britain's position on the Korean issue and on the issue of the People's Republic of China. The Workers Daily pointed out that all American newspapers have put forward a united front, attempting to intimidate and force Britain to obey the United States on the China issue.

The pro-American Daily Mail declared in an editorial: "The split between Britain and the United States is deepening day by day."

　　撤消美国提案！不许和中国作战！        
    英人民严斥美对我诽谤案
    【新华社布拉格二日电】伦敦工人日报消息：英中友好协会与英国和平委员会于一日分别发表声明，号召英国人民奋起反对英国政府在联合国内支持美国诽谤中国案的投降行为。
    英中友好协会在其声明中称：“我们认为政府退而支持美国谴责中国为侵略者的提案，意味着扩大对中国的敌对行为。我们号召一切加入本协会的团体及其成员立即向首相和他们各自选举的议员提出抗议”。英国和平委员会在类似的呼吁书中要求大家注意印度代表劳氏的严重的警告，劳氏说：由于对中国采取这个行动，“世界在正走向灾难”。
    【新华社布拉格二日电】伦敦工人日报一日发表社论称：“英国政府投票赞成美国所提谴责中国为‘侵略者’的提案，就是采取了一个步骤，这个步骤将会打消以和平谈判方式解决朝鲜问题的可能性。英国政府不顾中国人民政府明白地警告谴责中国为侵略者将破坏和平解决的希望，毫无骨气地屈服于美国在这个问题上所施行的压力；这就鼓励了美国疯狂地走向对中国进行战争。”
    该报称：“随着大会违反宪章而集会通过了这个提案，美国将置安全理事会于不顾，继续致力于进行制裁和最后的战争。”
    该报指出：“任何一个英国人都不应当对现已造成的局势的严重性存有任何幻想。”
    该报指出：“这不是对道义的关怀”，因为“在朝鲜问题上联合国没有道义上的地位”。“促成这个决定的东西只是无耻的骄横的美国式的敲诈”。“美国的提案不但受到苏联的反对，而且受到印度和缅甸的反对。这个提案没有得到任何一个亚洲国家的支持。它受到大多数人类的反对。”
    该报在结语中向人民发出号召：“每一个反对和中国作战的人，现在是必须行动的时候了！撤销美国的提案！不要支持美国疯子！不许和中国作战！立即按照印度、中国和苏联提出的办法以谈判方式解决问题！”
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦二日讯：泰晤士报接到伯明罕大学三十一位职员的来信，信中说：“许许多多的英国人民在朝鲜问题上都支持谈判的政策，而不主张用制裁的办法。他们要求政府在这个问题以及德国重新武装与四国会议问题上取得妥协的协议”。
    泰晤士报也接到牛津大学教授与讲师的来信，他们写道：“假若我们重新武装德国，我们就是公然不顾波茨坦协定。这样的行动就会使我们受到责备，说我们关心建立所谓‘实力的情势’甚于保持对外交上的道德标准的尊重”。
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦一月二十七日讯：英国报纸在评论联合国大会政治委员会对朝鲜问题的讨论时，指出英美矛盾的尖锐化。
    《论坛》周刊写道：目前，在英美关系上“存在着最严重的裂痕”。在论及艾德礼在下院就中国问题所作的声明时，该刊除了对艾德礼表示英国准备接受美国提案中谴责中国的部分以外，完全赞同这一演说。该刊并称，无论危险怎样大，为了与美国人表示虚伪的一致，而放弃智慧，是会招致灾难的，《每日先驱报》、《新闻纪事报》、《每日快报》、《每日邮报》都刊载美国报纸上反映美帝国主义者对英国在朝鲜问题上和在对中华人民共和国问题上所持立场表示不满的简讯。《工人日报》指出，所有美国各报纸都提出统一阵线，力图恫吓并迫使英国在中国问题上服从美国。
    亲美的《每日邮报》在社论中宣称：“英美之间的分裂一天天加深了”。
