　　Great Heritage, Infinitely Bright Future
　  A Record of the Symposium of Natural Science Workers Convened by the China Democratic League
　　Luo Zimei
    On February 4th, the Culture and Education Committee of the headquarters of the China Democratic League and the Culture and Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Branch jointly hosted Professor Zhao Zhongyao, who had recently returned to China, and invited natural scientists Hua Luogeng, Pei Wenzhong, Yang Zhongjian, Zhang Jingyue, Hu Xiansu, Zhou Peiyuan, Huang Ziqing, Yuan Hanqing, and Zhou Tingru to participate. Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, and Zhou Jianren of the China Democratic League also attended the meeting. At the meeting, a symposium was held on the theme of "Review and Prospect of Natural Science in China."

    Mr. Zhao Zhongyao spoke first. He said, "From now on, I am determined to work hard and learn humbly in the revolutionary construction of the motherland." Professor Huang Ziqing of the Department of Chemistry of Tsinghua University and paleontologist and former President of Northwest University, Mr. Yang Zhongjian, pointed out that ancient Chinese alchemy, the so-called "Azure Dragon" and "White Tiger," were actually pseudonyms for sulfur and mercury (quicksilver). Winemaking fermentation, fireworks, rocket launchers, and porcelain were all ancient Chinese inventions. Other things such as ancient Song Dynasty block-printed books, printing... were also great contributions of our ancestors in science. They believed that Chinese natural scientists should collect more information in these areas and compile a history textbook of Chinese science.

    Professor Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University and Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said, "Ancient Chinese science had brilliant achievements in mathematics. For example, Liu Hui of the Han Dynasty used the method of cutting circles to obtain a value of pi of 3.1416. Later, Zu Chongzhi calculated even more precise differences beyond five decimal places, using 22/7 and 355/113 as the approximate and precise ratios, and further calculated the upper and lower limits, showing how rational numbers approach irrational numbers." Mr. Hua said that we must not only research and verify the treasures of ancient Chinese science, but also study them in depth.

    Professor Zhang Jingyue of the Department of Botany of Peking University introduced the research on ancient Chinese agricultural biology. Methods such as intensive cultivation with crop rotation, the use of legume fertilizers, and grafting trees and transplanting flowers, such as grafting plums onto wintergreen and peaches onto persimmons, were ingenious and transformed nature. Former Director of the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute and current professor at the Normal University, Hu Xiansu, pointed out that we can discover materials about Chinese scientific knowledge from the notes and essays of many ancient celebrities. For example, the "Mengxi Bitan" of the Song Dynasty recorded that Shao Kangjie (Yong) believed that "fossils" might have been caused by changes in climate. In addition, historical records show that Su Dongpo knew how to cultivate "seedless loquats," Mozi understood the principles of gliders, and Wang Mang discovered the circulatory system, all of which prove the authenticity of ancient Chinese scientific knowledge. Mr. Zhou Tingru pointed out that the book Yu Gong is very rich in knowledge about mountains, rivers, and soil in terms of natural geography. In addition, the Lingqu water conservancy project and the discovery of the Jinsha River source were great contributions of ancient China.

    Famous archaeologist Pei Wenzhong said: China has a vast land and abundant resources, and a long history and culture. Our ancestors had very rich labor experience. Not to mention the Great Wall of China, ancient Chinese architecture such as the Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei and the wooden pagoda in Jehol are also national treasures of China. Although there was no theory of mechanics at that time, the architectural principles were in line with science. These brilliant and great scientific achievements have inspired our patriotism to love our motherland, love our people, and love science.

    Speaking of the achievements of modern Chinese scientists, Yuan Hanqing, Director of the Science Popularization Bureau, said: Although modern Chinese scientists have been shackled and oppressed by imperialism and feudal forces for decades, they have still been able to bury themselves in research. The discovery of Peking Man and the Metasequoia glyptostroboides in Wanxian, Sichuan, are great achievements in the modern history of Chinese science. Mr. Yuan Hanqing, Hu Xiansu, Huang Ziqing, Yang Zhongjian and others unanimously advocated systematically introducing the achievements of modern Chinese scientists to young people to enhance their confidence in natural science research.

    Professor Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Tsinghua University, expressed his views on the combination of patriotism and natural science. He believes that reliable historical facts should be used as teaching materials in middle school textbooks to cultivate and stimulate young people's patriotic enthusiasm. Universities in China should strengthen the research and collation of the history of Chinese science. Mr. Yuan Hanqing expressed his views on how to enrich the teaching content of patriotism. He believes that we should actively cultivate and promote the virtue of loving science based on the Common Program. In terms of teaching technology, we should uniformly stipulate scientific terms and nouns; in terms of science popularization, we should regularly conduct lectures on scientific knowledge. Combining science popularization with patriotic education can enable the broad masses of people to truly master the weapons of science.

    Professor Zhang Jingyue believes that to combine scientific research with patriotism, science must be localized, that is, science must be popularized and massified. Only in this way can science take root and bear fruit in Chinese soil. Mr. Zhang advocated the promotion of planting beautiful plants such as ginkgo trees. Ginkgo trees are vigorous plants, both beautiful and medicinal, and are China's unique ancient trees. "Old and vigorous" symbolizes the characteristics of the Chinese nation.

    Professor Hu Xiansu believes that the compilation of Chinese economic plants and the preservation of newly discovered plants in China such as Metasequoia are necessary.

    Mr. Pei Wenzhong said: We should explore the scientific knowledge of Chinese history, and make accurate evaluations and criticisms. Modern Chinese scientific research has made achievements, but it is not enough. We should not be complacent, nor should we have a sense of inferiority.

    Professor Pan Guangdan said: The notes and essays of Chinese literati in the past, such as the Baopuzi, are relatively reliable reference materials for exploring the history of Chinese science. However, we should avoid far-fetched associations and resorting to conjecture. We should adhere to a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, neither exaggerating nor diminishing.

    Finally, Professor Zeng Zhaolun, Provost of Peking University, thanked the scientists present on behalf of the China Democratic League. He said excitedly: The development of Chinese science will enter a new stage, and the scientific workers of New China have an infinitely bright future.

　　伟大的遗产，无限光明的发展前途
　  记民盟召开的自然科学工作者座谈会
　　罗自梅
    二月四日，中国民主同盟总部文教委员会与北京市支部文教委员会联合招待新近返国的赵忠尧教授，并邀请自然科学工作者华罗庚、裴文中、杨钟健、张景钺、胡先骕、周培源、黄子卿、袁翰青、周廷儒等参加。民盟张东荪、曾昭抡、潘光旦、周建人等都到会参加。会上，以《中国自然科学的回顾与前瞻》为题举行了座谈。
    赵忠尧先生首先发言。他说：“今后我决心要在祖国革命建设中，努力工作，虚心学习。”清华大学化学系黄子卿教授与古生物学家前西北大学校长杨钟健先生指出：中国古代的炼金术，即所谓“青龙”“白虎”，实际上就是硫磺与汞（水银）的化名。造酒发酵、烟火、火箭筒、瓷器等都是中国古代的发明。其他如宋刻古版书、印刷术……也是我们古代在科学上的伟大贡献。他俩认为中国自然科学工作者应在这些方面多多搜集资料，编纂中国科学的历史教程。
    清华大学教授、中国科学院数学研究所所长华罗庚先生说：“中国古代科学在数学方面是有光辉成绩的。如汉朝刘徽的割圆术即曾求得圆周率为三·一四一六；后来祖冲之又求出在小数五位以上精密的差距，以２２／７与３５５／１１３为疏率与密率，而且进一步求出上限与下限，有理数怎样接近无理数。”华先生说，我们一方面对中国古代科学的宝藏必须考据，另一方面更应深入地加以研究。
    北京大学植物系张景钺教授介绍了关于中国古代农业生物学的研究。如深耕细作的轮耕制、豆类肥料之利用，接树移花的方法如梅接冬青、桃接柿等，都巧夺天工，改造了自然。前静生生物调查所所长、现师范大学胡先骕教授指出：从古代许多名人札记随笔中，我们能随时发现关于中国科学知识的材料，如宋代《梦生笔谈》中，即曾记叙邵康节（雍）认定“化石”可能系因气候的改变所致。此外，在历史记载中，苏东坡对‘无核枇杷’的种植，墨子懂得滑翔机原理，以及王莽对血液循环系统的发现，都能证明古代中国科学知识的真实性。周廷儒先生就自然地理方面，指出禹贡一书关于山川、河流、土壤的知识非常丰富。又如灵渠水利建设，金沙江水源的发现，都是中国古代伟大的贡献。
    名考古学家裴文中说：中国地大物博，历史与文化悠久，我们的先祖有着非常丰富的劳动经验。古代中国的建筑，万里长城固不必说，即河北赵州桥，热河木塔等建筑物，也是中国的国宝。那时虽然还没有力学理论，而建筑原理却是合乎科学的。这些光辉伟大的科学成就，激发了我们爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学的爱国主义精神。
    谈到现代中国科学家的成就，科学普及局局长袁翰青先生说：现代中国的科学工作者，几十年来虽在帝国主义和封建势力的束缚与压迫下，仍能埋头研究，如北京猿人和四川万县水杉的发现都是中国近代科学史上伟大的成就。袁翰青、胡先骕、黄子卿、杨钟健诸先生一致主张把中国现代科学家的成就，有系统的介绍给青年，提高他们对自然科学研究的信心。
    清华大学教务长周培源教授，就爱国主义与自然科学相结合的问题发表意见。他认为在中学课本中，应以可靠史实作为教材，以培养与激发青年的爱国热情。国内各大学应加强中国科学史的研究与整理工作。袁翰青先生则就怎样充实爱国主义的教学内容发表了意见。他认为我们应根据共同纲领积极培养与发扬爱科学的美德。在教学技术方面，我们应统一规定科学上的术语名词；在科学普及方面，我们应经常进行有关科学知识的讲演。科学普及与爱国主义教育相结合，才能使广大人民真正掌握科学的武器。
    张景钺教授认为，要使科学研究与爱国主义相结合，必须使科学乡土化，就是使科学普及、大众化。这样才能使科学在中国土壤上生根结果。张先生主张推广种植如白果树一类的美好植物。白果树是富有活力的植物，既美丽，又可以治病，是中国唯一的古树。“古老而有活力”正象征着中国民族的特性。
    胡先骕教授认为，中国经济植物的编纂和中国新发现植物如水杉等的保存，都是必要的。
    裴文中先生说：我们应该发掘中国历史的科学知识，加以确切的评价与批判。近代中国科学研究是有成绩的，但还不够。我们不应该自满，也不应有自卑的心理。
    潘光旦教授说：中国过去文人的笔记、随笔如抱朴子之类，都是发掘中国科学历史的比较可靠的参考材料。但是，我们应避免牵强附会而流于臆断。我们应本实事求是的科学态度，不夸大也不缩小。
    最后，北京大学教务长曾昭抡教授代表民盟向到会的各位科学家表示感谢。他兴奋地说：中国科学发展将进入新的阶段，新中国的科学工作者，有着无限光明的前途。
