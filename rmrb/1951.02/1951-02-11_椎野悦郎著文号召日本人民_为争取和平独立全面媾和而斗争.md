Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The January issue of the Japanese Communist Party magazine "New World" published an article by Shino Etsuro, Chairman of the Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, entitled "Welcoming the New Year of Striving for Peace and Independence."

　　Shino first pointed out that the great cause accomplished by the people in the twentieth century is unprecedented in history. In particular, the victory of the people of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China has made the first half of the twentieth century unparalleled in history. Because of this victory, the strength of the people has surpassed that of the reactionary ruling class.

　　After criticizing the American interventionists for invading Korea and China's Taiwan and violating China's airspace, Shino exposed the United States' conspiracy to invade the Chinese mainland using Korea and Taiwan as springboards. He said: The result of the Chinese people organizing volunteer troops to support the Korean people shattered the interventionists' invasion plan. However, the interventionists have not abandoned their plan. The people of the world must further unite to overthrow the warmongers.

　　Shino continued: Colonizing and turning Japan into a military base is a consistent policy of reactionary forces at home and abroad. When the war of intervention in Korea began, this policy was carried out even more blatantly. Japan's main factories have become arsenals for this war of intervention. Shipyards are being used to rearm warships injured in the war of intervention. Sailors are being mobilized for military supply transportation work. Even the unemployed are being deceived and sent to Korea to be used in the war of intervention. These things are being carried out in combination with the colonial rule of the Japanese people. Under the name of assisting the United Nations, Japanese workers are being forced to work under conditions that completely disregard basic human rights. Workers live a slave life of low wages and intensified labor. Farmers' harvests are being requisitioned under the pretext of being sent to the Korean front. Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators are going bankrupt due to the ever-increasing taxes from the war budget.

　　Shino further pointed out that this oppression by reactionary forces at home and abroad is not only imposed on the lives of the people. The current Diet, which is in session, has also completely lost its autonomy and has become a tool for colonizing and turning Japan into a military base. In order to strengthen this rule, they have also released war criminals and joined their ranks. At the same time, they have deprived patriots who oppose war and defend peace of their freedom. The separate peace treaty they are planning is nothing more than a trick to take advantage of the Japanese people's hope for peace and to legitimize their ambition to colonize and turn Japan into a military base.

　　Shino emphasized that in Japan, the struggle for peace and the struggle for national independence are inextricably linked. We must fight for both goals of peace and national independence. 1951 is a year for all the people to unite for peace and independence.

　　Shino finally called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to become active members of the people's movement for a comprehensive peace treaty for peace and independence, and to fight to mobilize tens of millions of people to participate in this movement.

　　椎野悦郎著文号召日本人民
　  为争取和平独立全面媾和而斗争
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本共产党杂志《新世界》一月号，刊载日共临时中央指导部主席椎野悦郎所作题为《迎争取和平与独立的新的一年》的论文。
    椎野首先指出：人民在二十世纪所完成的伟大事业，是历史上空前的。特别是苏联、东欧以及中国人民的胜利，使二十世纪上半叶在历史上无上光辉。由于这个胜利，人民的力量已经超过了反动统治阶级的力量。
    椎野在指责美国干涉者侵略朝鲜和中国的台湾并侵犯中国领空后，揭露了美国妄图以朝鲜和台湾为跳板侵略中国大陆的阴谋。他说：中国人民组织志愿军支援朝鲜人民的结果，粉碎了干涉者的侵略计划。但是，干涉者并未放弃他们的计划。世界人民要进一步团结起来，打倒战争贩子。
    椎野继称：使日本殖民地化和军事基地化，是国内外反动势力的一贯政策。当干涉朝鲜的战争开始后，这种政策更是露骨地进行着。日本的主要工厂成了进行这一干涉战争的兵工厂。造船厂被用于重新武装在干涉战争中受伤的舰艇。船员被动员为军需运输工作。甚至失业者也被欺骗送往朝鲜，被用于干涉战争。这些事情是和对日本人民的殖民地统治相结合而进行的。在协助联合国的名义下，日本工人被驱使在完全忽视基本人权的条件下劳动。工人过着工资低微、劳动强化的奴隶生活。农民的收获物在送往朝鲜前线的借口下被征收殆尽。中小工商业者，由于日益增加的战争预算的课税，正在破产。
    椎野进一步指出：国内外反动势力的这种压迫，不仅加在人民的生活中。现在正在开会的国会，也完全丧失了自主性，成了使日本殖民地化与军事基地化的工具。他们为了加强这种统治，还释放了战争罪犯，加入他们的阵营。与此同时，他们剥夺了反对战争，保卫和平的爱国者的自由。他们所计划的单独媾和，不过是想利用日本人民对媾和的希望，乘机使这种殖民地化与军事基地化的野心合法化的把戏而已。
    椎野强调指出：在日本，争取和平的斗争与争取民族独立的斗争，两者有着不可分离的关系。我们为了和平与民族独立这两个目的，必须斗争。一九五一年是全体人民为了和平与独立团结起来的一年。
    椎野最后号召日本共产党全体党员成为争取和平与独立的全面媾和的人民运动中的积极分子，并为动员成千万的人民参加这一运动而斗争。
