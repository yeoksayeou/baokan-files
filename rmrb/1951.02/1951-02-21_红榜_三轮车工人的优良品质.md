　　Red List: The Fine Qualities of a Tricycle Worker
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a staff member of Beijing Normal University. On the morning of January 31st, I went to work from my residence at Lao Qianju in Dongcheng, and during the trip, I carelessly lost my watch. I didn't realize it until I got to the office, and I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. I returned home in frustration at noon. After lunch, a tricycle worker named Zhang Deming (who lives at No. 20 Paozihe) knocked on my door, saying that he had found a watch on his tricycle, searched extensively for the owner but couldn't find them, and finally found my home. I was deeply moved by his actions, and I think Zhang Deming's fine qualities are worthy of praise.
    Since liberation, everyone has undergone no small changes, especially the working class, whose political consciousness has significantly improved. I deeply feel that this era has brought us a new life.

　　红榜  三轮车工人的优良品质
    编辑同志：
    我是北京师范大学的一个工作人员。一月三十一日清晨，我自东城老钱局住处赴学校上班，途中不慎，将手表失落。至办公室才发现，遍寻不着。中午懊丧回家。吃过午饭，忽有三轮车工人张德明（家住泡子河二十号）叩门，说在车上发现手表一个，遍寻不得失主，最后才找到我家。我深深地为他这种行动所感动，我觉得张德明这种优良品质是值得表扬的。
    自解放以后，每个人都起了不小的变化，尤其是工人阶级，政治觉悟显著提高。我深深感到这个时代给我们带来了新的生活。
