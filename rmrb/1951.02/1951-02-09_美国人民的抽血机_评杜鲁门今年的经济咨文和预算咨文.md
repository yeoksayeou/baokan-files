　　The American People's Blood-Drawing Machine
　　——A Review of Truman's Economic and Budget Messages This Year
　　Bao Chang
　　In mid-January, Truman submitted his annual economic and budget messages to Congress.

　　If in last year's message, Truman was still lamenting the economic crisis of 1949, this year's message is entirely about strengthening his exploitation of the American people in order to expand the military and prepare for war, and to push the American economy further into the abyss of inflation.

　　What can be seen from Truman's economic and budget messages this year?

　　First of all, we see a massive military expansion plan. In his "Budget Message," Truman pointed out that the total budget appropriation for the 1951-52 fiscal year is 94.5 billion yuan, of which direct military expenditure is approximately 48.9 billion yuan, and this does not include various items of indirect military expenditure. Adding the more than 50 billion yuan in military expenditure for the 1950-51 fiscal year, the military expenditure for these two years has already exceeded 100 billion US dollars. However, Truman also demanded in his "Economic Message" that the military appropriation for these two years be increased to "over 140 billion US dollars"?!

　　Truman demands such a huge military expenditure, but completely disregards the life and death of the American people. According to experts, manufacturing one bomber can build 325 independent houses; manufacturing one aircraft carrier can support 100,000 college students for five years. Scientist Curie further calculated that manufacturing one cruiser can build ten academies of sciences and maintain their work for one hundred years. If 100 billion US dollars were used to solve the American people's livelihood problems, 14 million independent houses could be built. At present, 15 million households in the United States live in slums, and these houses could almost completely solve the problem.

　　Truman formulated such a large-scale military buildup plan that pushes the people into the abyss of poverty, but he turns around and asks the people for money. The message openly confesses that the United States will encounter "the danger of inflation." Moreover, he shamelessly warns the people that military appropriations require the sacrifice of the people: "Great sacrifices must be made for many years to come – even down to economizing on towels and tablecloths." Especially the workers, he said: "Workers must make sacrifices... They must accept wage restrictions and wage controls aimed at preventing wage increases (wages can only be increased when more goods are produced)."

　　In fact, since the start of the war of aggression against Korea, inflation in the United States has been increasing day by day. Prices continue to rise. The Madi Price Index was 395 on June 20 last year, 474.2 on September 20, and further increased to 487.6 on December 8. In half a year, American prices have risen by about 15 to 24 percent. Among them, food prices have risen by 20 percent since the end of June.

　　Wages have not increased much, only about 7 percent in half a year. Compared with rising prices, real wages have actually decreased. Since the Korean War, real wages have decreased by 35.6 percent. Farmers' income also decreased by 7 to 11 percent last year. A large number of unemployed people still exist. According to official materials, even in August after the Korean War, there were still 2.5 million unemployed people. In mid-November, more than 186,000 people registered for unemployment relief every week.

　　The combination of "inflation" and "wage control" is essentially a further reduction in the living standards of the working people, which can be seen from the following examples. According to the Wall Street Journal on May 8 last year, the sales of bread in several states in the first few months of last year decreased by 20 percent compared with the same period in 1949. According to the conservative estimate of the US Department of Labor, from the time the United States began its aggression against Korea to mid-December last year, the cost of living had risen by 4.8 percent, which is 78.4 percent higher than before the war. Food prices rose by 5.3 percent, clothing by 6.2 percent, furniture by 10.6 percent, and rent by 1.5 percent. According to a report from the US Census Bureau last year, more than 57 percent of families in the United States had income less than expenditure in 1949, and this situation worsened in 1950. Please see, everyone: Truman is still asking the American people to "sacrifice" under such circumstances!

　　In addition to "inflation" and "wage control," the next step is to reduce the "expenditure on education, health and other public utilities" in the budget. In fact, in the 1950 fiscal year budget, military expenditure has reached 80 percent, while expenditure on social security, health, housing, education and labor only accounts for 8 percent. But Truman ignores this situation: there are 20 million illiterate adults and 6 million out-of-school children in the United States. Moreover, in terms of health, according to a report by Oscar R. Ewing, former director of the Federal Security Agency two years ago: "Less than 20 percent of the American people can afford the medical expenses they need, and about half of the families – those with an income of 3,000 US dollars or less – find it extremely difficult to pay even for daily medical expenses." Here, Truman has poured every penny he can scrape from the people into cannons.

　　A more direct method of oppressing the people is to increase taxes. Truman urged Congress in his message to "greatly increase taxes." He said: "The new tax increases currently needed must increase the burden on all existing sources of taxation." He asked the American people: "We must work harder, reduce consumption, and abandon improvements in farms, businesses, and home equipment."

　　Taxes have already increased a lot this year. On September 22 last year, the US Congress passed the "Tax Increase Act," increasing taxes by 4.5 billion US dollars. The increased tax amount is mainly imposed on the working people. The new tax rate increases their personal income tax by 20 to 21 percent. In the 81st Congress, which closed on January 2 this year, a 3.4 billion "excess profits tax" bill was also passed. According to statistics, the tax revenue for the 1950 fiscal year was eight times that of 1938. The "Tax Increase Act" has become Truman's blood-drawing machine for the working people, causing great pain to the people. Even a bourgeois economist admits that most Americans cannot purchase urgently needed clothing, food and other necessities because they must pay one-third to one-half of their income to the federal government and local administrative authorities to pay taxes.

　　In contrast, the monopoly capitalists have made a fortune. According to official US materials, last year's profits will reach a new record of 23.5 billion US dollars, twice that of 1944, or more than four times that of 1939. In the second quarter of last year, the profits of 321 large companies increased by 46.5 percent compared with the same quarter in 1949. Moreover, Truman is planning to expand the Air Force from 48 groups to 69 groups. It is estimated that in the first year of the expansion plan, the government orders of aircraft companies can reach more than 8 billion US dollars.

　　In short, from Truman's economic message, it is not difficult for us to see that the American warmongers are doing their best to try to lead the entire American national economy to a war economy, in order to implement aggression to get rid of the increasingly severe economic crisis. The American working people have paid extremely great sacrifices, but the monopoly capitalists have seized countless gold dollars. Moreover, the American imperialist aggressors vainly attempt to burn the flames of war to the people of the world. However, the plans of all war conspirators will not achieve their goals. What lies before them is not the world hegemony they fantasize about, but the strong opposition of the people all over the world, and the thorough failure of the imperialist system, leading to its final collapse.

　　美国人民的抽血机
    ——评杜鲁门今年的经济咨文和预算咨文
    鲍昌
    杜鲁门在一月中旬向国会提出了每年一度的经济咨文和预算咨文。
    如果说，在去年的咨文里，杜鲁门还在为一九四九年的经济危机而哀鸣；那么，今年的咨文就完全是为了扩军备战而加强其对美国人民的榨取，并把美国经济进一步推向通货膨胀的深渊中去。
    从杜鲁门今年的经济与预算咨文里，可以看到些什么呢？
    首先，我们就看到一个庞大的扩军计划。杜鲁门在“预算咨文”中指出：一九五一——五二会计年度的预算拨款总计为九百四十五亿元，其中直接军费约四百八十九亿元，这还不包括间接军事费用的各种项目。加上一九五○——五一会计年度的五百多亿军费，于是，这两个年度的军费就已经超过一千亿美元以上了。可是，杜鲁门在“经济咨文”中还要求这两个年度的军事拨款提到“一千四百亿美元”以上呢？！
    杜鲁门要求这样庞大的军费，但是却完全不管美国人民的死活。据专家统计：制造一架轰炸机可以建筑三二五所独立住宅；制造一艘航空母舰可以供养十万个大学生五年花用。科学家居里更统计出：制造一艘巡洋舰可以建筑十个科学院，并维持其工作一百年。一千亿美元如果拿来解决美国人的生活问题，就可以建筑一千四百万所独立住宅。目前，全美国有一千五百万户住在贫民窟里，这些房子就差不多可以完全解决问题。
    杜鲁门制订出这么大的把人民推向贫困深渊的军备计划，却还反手向人民要钱。咨文里公开招认：美国将遇到“通货膨胀的危险”。并且，他无耻地警告人民：军事拨款需要人民的牺牲：“今后多少年都须作巨大牺牲——直到省用毛巾和桌布。”特别是工人，他说：“工人们必须有所牺牲……他们必须接受旨在阻止工资增加（只有生产了更多的货物时，才能提高工资）的工资限制与工资管制。”
    实际上，从侵朝战争开始后，美国通货膨胀早就日甚一日了。物价不断高涨，马迪氏物价指数，在去年六月二十日为三九五，九月二十日即涨至四七四·二，到十二月八日更涨至四八七·六。半年来，美国物价上涨约达百分之十五至二十四。其中食品价格从六月底上涨了百分之二十。
    工资却未增加多少，半年来仅增加百分之七。和上涨的物价相比，实际工资反而减少，从朝鲜战争以来实际工资降低百分之三十五点六。去年的农民收入也少了百分之七至十一。失业人数仍大量存在，据官方材料：即使在朝鲜战争以后的八月份，失业人数仍有二百五十万人。在十一月中，每星期失业登记救济者超过十八万六千人。
    “通货膨胀”与“工资管制”的双管齐下，实质上就是进一步压低劳动人民的生活水准，这从下面的几个例子就可看出。据去年五月八日《华尔街日报》声称：去年年初几个月若干州的面包出售额较一九四九年同期减少了百分之二十。又据美国劳工部的保守估计，从美国开始侵略朝鲜到去年十二月中，生活费用已上升了百分之四点八，比战前已高出百分之七十八点四。食物价格上涨了百分之五点三，衣着百分之六点二，家具百分之十点六，房租百分之一点五。又据去年美户口调查局报告：一九四九年全美已有百分之五十七以上家庭入不敷出，这一情况到一九五○年更坏。大家请看：杜鲁门在这样情况下，还要求美国人民“牺牲”哩！
    除了“通货膨胀”与“限制工资”外，进一步就是减少预算中的“教育、卫生及其他公共事业的经费”。实际上，一九五○年会计年度的预算中，军费已达百分之八十，而关于社会安全、卫生、房屋、教育与劳工的支出只占百分之八。可是杜鲁门就不理会这个情况：在美国的成年文盲有两千万人，失学儿童六百万人。并且，在卫生方面，据前年联邦安全局局长阿斯加·艾文报告：“美国人民能付得起他们必需的医药费还不到百分之二十，约有半数的家庭——有三千美元或不到三千美元收入者——即使能够支付日常医药费，也感到异常困难。”在这里，杜鲁门已把他从人民身上所能刮下的每一块钱，都灌到大炮里头去了。
    压榨人民更直接的方法就是增税。杜鲁门在咨文中促请国会“大大增加赋税”。他说：“目前所需要的新的增税，必定使现在一切税源加重。”他要求美国人民：“我们必须更努力工作，减少消费，放弃在农场、企业与家庭设备等方面的改善。”
    今年的税已经增加不少了。去年九月二十二日，美国会通过“增税法案”，增税四十五亿美元，增加的税额主要是加在劳动人民身上，新税率使他们的个人所得税增加百分之二十至二十一。在今年一月二日闭幕的第八十一届国会中，又通过了三十四亿的“过份所得税”法案。据统计：一九五○年会计年度的税收为一九三八年的八倍。“增税法案”成为杜鲁门对劳动人民的抽血机，给予人民莫大的痛苦。就连一个资产阶级经济学家也承认：多数的美国人不能购买急需的衣服、食物和其他必需品。因为他们必须把三分之一到二分之一的收入交付联邦政府及地方行政当局，以完纳课税。
    与此相反，独占资本家却发了大财。据美国官方材料估计：去年利润将达二百三十五亿的新纪录，为一九四四年的两倍，或一九三九年的四倍还多。去年第二季，三百二十一家大公司的利润较一九四九年同季增加百分之四六·五。并且，杜鲁门正拟把空军由四十八个大队扩充到六十九个大队。估计在第一年的扩充计划中，飞机公司的政府订货即可达到八十多亿美元。
    总之，从杜鲁门的经济咨文中，我们不难看到：美国的战争贩子们正竭尽力量企图把全美国的国民经济引向战争经济，为的是实行侵略以解脱日益深重的经济危机。美国的劳动人民已经付出了极大的牺牲，独占资本家们却攫取了无数的金元。并且，美帝国主义侵略者妄想把战争的火焰烧向全世界的人民。但是，一切战争阴谋者的计划是达不到目的的。摆在他们面前的：不是他们所幻想的世界霸权，而是全世界人民的坚强反对，和帝国主义制度遭到彻底的失败，以至走向最后的崩溃。
