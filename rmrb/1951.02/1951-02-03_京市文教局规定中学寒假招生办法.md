[This report is from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Education recently stipulated the "Enrollment Methods and Precautions for Municipal Middle Schools During Winter Vacation," and issued an order to all schools for implementation. The enrollment methods stipulate: The enrollment targets are out-of-school youth and transfer students from other places to Beijing. Students currently enrolled in schools in this city will not be accepted unless they have been approved by their original school and issued a transfer certificate. Regarding enrollment grades, municipal middle schools will not enroll students in any grade of junior high school. For senior high school grades, generally, enrollment will also not occur, except in special circumstances that have been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education. Classes with too few students can be combined according to the actual situation (merging classes of the same grade in the school, or merging with classes of the same grade in nearby municipal middle schools). For private middle schools, those with more than fifty students in the first and second grades of senior and junior high school should not enroll more students; those with fewer than fifty students may enroll appropriately; the third grades of senior and junior high school will generally not enroll students, except for individual cases that have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education. In order to unify the start and graduation system of municipal secondary schools, there will be no spring semester starting classes. However, if municipal and private middle schools have the conditions (such as vacant classrooms, teachers, etc.), they can enroll junior preparatory classes (remedial courses for higher elementary school; those who pass the examination after the summer semester can be promoted to the first grade of junior high school). Schools wishing to enroll such classes must report to the Municipal Bureau of Education in advance and obtain approval before enrollment. Existing auditors in each school should be regarded as non-enrolled students. The schools should allow them to apply to their desired schools with their original academic credentials in order to obtain formal student status. Vacancies in the worker-peasant children's classes of municipal middle schools and the municipal middle school classes attached to individual private middle schools will be filled by the Municipal Bureau of Education in conjunction with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions with out-of-school worker-peasant children. Private middle schools can set their own enrollment dates; municipal middle schools must enroll students after the Spring Festival and before the start of the next semester (February 16th). The dates of the entrance examinations will be uniformly stipulated by the Bureau of Education to avoid duplicate admissions of candidates. Regarding the precautions for enrollment, the regulations are: When students register, only those who have a formal transfer certificate after verification and whose grade to be applied for matches the grade on their certificate are allowed to register; students who are required to submit a transfer certificate after the examination or who are required to apply with equivalent academic qualifications are not allowed to register. In order to take care of out-of-school students, certificates with non-matching grades can be handled according to the following principles: A. Students applying for the second grade of senior or junior high school whose academic certificate differs from the grade to be applied for by one semester are allowed to register. B. Students applying for the first grade of senior or junior high school who hold a junior high school or higher elementary school graduation certificate issued before 1949 are allowed to register. All students who have graduated from higher elementary school can apply for the first grade of the preparatory class. (Wang Ming)
