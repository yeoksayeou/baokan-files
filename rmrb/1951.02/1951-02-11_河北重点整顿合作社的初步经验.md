Preliminary Experiences in Key Rectification of Cooperatives in Hebei

The work of key rectification of cooperatives in Hebei Province has been successful. Over the past two months, 90% of the 251 grassroots cooperatives that have undergone rectification have embarked on the correct path of serving their members.

Starting with improving business operations to meet the current needs of members is one of the important experiences of key cooperative rectification in Hebei Province. According to a survey of 140 rectified cooperatives: 73 first improved their business operations before rectifying their organization; 61 combined the two; all 134 cooperatives were successfully rectified. The remaining six cooperatives failed because they only rectified their organization. The successful method of cooperative rectification starts with meeting the current needs of members. Cooperatives in cotton-producing areas promote and sell members' cotton and supply members with needed grain and fuel coal; cooperatives in mountainous areas promote and sell mountain products and medicinal materials and supply grain, cloth, and kerosene; cooperatives in disaster areas promote and sell members' sideline products and supply their raw materials. Taking the rectification of Gongzhuang Village Cooperative in Luan County as an example, they first solved the difficulty of sluggish sales of agricultural product—mulberry bark—for the vast number of members. After discussing with the Bayi Paper Mill and Qian'an Paper Mill, they established a long-term supply relationship for mulberry bark, finding a way out for the mulberry bark accumulated in recent years. The cooperative also signed a contract with the county cooperative to promote and sell 7,000 catties of members' peanuts and supply members with 20,000 catties of commonly used white sorghum rice. After such business rectification, the prestige of Gongzhuang Village Cooperative among members and the masses greatly increased, and 600 non-members joined the cooperative in three days.

While grassroots cooperatives are improving business operations to serve members, higher-level cooperatives must also implement the principle of serving lower-level cooperatives. For example, in the rectification of Dachugoukou Joint Village Cooperative in Fuping County, the Fuping County General Cooperative helped sell more than 6,000 catties of members' medicinal materials and 1,000 catties of hemp seeds and helped supply members with 3,800 catties of edible salt and 4,500 catties of corn, which ensured the smooth completion of the cooperative's rectification work and the development of 382 new members.

According to Hebei Province's experience, higher-level cooperatives' support for lower-level cooperatives must be timely and frequent and must not stop after rectification. Otherwise, even grassroots cooperatives that have been rectified and are on the right track cannot consolidate their rectification results. For example, Weishanzhuang Joint Village Cooperative in Daxing County once increased its turnover from 600,000 yuan per market to 1.7 million yuan after being rectified with the support of the county cooperative. However, after the rectification, the Daxing County General Cooperative did not continue to support the joint village cooperative in business operations. When members urgently needed coal and corn, the county cooperative did not help solve the problem but instead misappropriated 3,000 catties from the cooperative's 5,000-catties corn share capital, making the cooperative unable to meet the needs of its members in business operations. Therefore, it relapsed into a slump, and its turnover dropped to about 640,000 yuan per market.

In order to support lower-level cooperatives, higher-level cooperatives must first overcome capitalist business thinking and methods like grassroots cooperatives and stop pursuing profits in the free market. To this end, 46 county cooperatives in Hebei Province have abolished their retail departments and concentrated their efforts on purchasing and selling operations to help grassroots cooperatives meet the needs of their members. Facts have proved that higher-level cooperatives themselves can cover their own expenses only with the handling fees for agency purchasing and sales resulting from the development of grassroots cooperative business operations, without relying on retail departments to make money. Secondly, after the business relationship between higher and lower-level cooperatives becomes close, profit distribution becomes an important issue. Hengshui Special District has stipulated the following maximum gross profit margins for cooperatives at all levels: 3% for the special district cooperative, 5% for the county cooperative, and 8% for the village cooperative. This "less at the top, more at the bottom" regulation is the proper way to support lower-level cooperatives. The special district also stipulates that the price of goods sold to members must be lower than the market price to implement the spirit of grassroots cooperatives serving their members. In addition, some higher and lower-level cooperatives have implemented a rationing system and a contract system, which have also helped grassroots cooperatives in their rectification work in business operations.

After improving business operations, the key rectification work of cooperatives in Hebei Province then rectifies the organization and implements the principle of democratic cooperative management. In the rectification of the organization, members generally voluntarily combine to form member groups, elect group leaders and member representatives, and then convene member representative meetings to elect directors and supervisors, approve the cooperative's constitution, establish various systems, determine cooperative affairs cadres and their treatment, and formulate business plans. After this, accounts are regularly publicized, and member representative meetings and board of directors meetings are held to summarize and check business operations. Because business operations have been improved and are geared towards members, members have benefited and become concerned about the cooperative, making it easier to do a good job in rectifying the organization. After the organization is rectified, the relationship between the cooperative and its members is closer, so it is easier to mobilize members to develop business operations. After the rectification of Beicang Joint Village Cooperative in Tianjin County, it proposed increasing share capital in order to meet the needs of the growing business. Within one day, it received new share capital amounting to one-third of the original share capital. Although this area is a severely affected disaster area, members happily said: "The cooperative is our own, and the cadres are elected by our own hands, how can we not support it."

At present, some of these cooperatives in Hebei Province, which have been rectified in business operations and organization and are on the right track, have developed new members and expanded their share capital. According to statistics from 128 grassroots cooperatives: after rectification, the average increase in members is 22.4%, the increase in share capital is 27%, and the turnover has also increased significantly.

### 河北重点整顿合作社的初步经验

　　河北重点整顿合作社的初步经验
    河北省重点整顿合作社的工作已经成功，两个多月来经过整顿的二百五十一个基层合作社，百分之九十都走上了为社员服务的正确经营道路。
    从改进业务满足社员当前需要入手，是河北省重点整社的重要经验之一。根据一百四十个整顿过的合作社的调查：有七十三个是先改进业务，再整顿组织；有六十一个是两者结合进行；这一百三十四个合作社都整顿成功了。其余六个合作社是单纯整顿组织，结果遭到失败。成功的整社方法是从满足社员当前需要入手，在产棉区的合作社推销社员棉花，供给社员需要的粮食和燃煤；在山区的合作社推销山货、药材，供给粮食、布匹和煤油；在灾区的合作社就推销社员副业产品，供给其原料。以滦县龚庄村社的整顿为例，他们首先着手解决了广大社员农产品——桑皮的滞销困难，和八一造纸厂、迁安造纸厂商谈后，建立了长期供给桑皮的关系，使近几年来积存的桑皮，找到了出路。该社又与县社订立了合同，推销了社员花生七千斤，供给社员惯用的白高粱米两万斤。在业务上如此整顿之后，龚庄村合作社在社员及群众中的威信大大提高，三天中就有六百名非社员入了社。
    与基层社改进业务面向社员的同时，上级社亦必须贯彻为下级社服务的方针。如阜平县大车沟口联村社在整社中，由于阜平县总社帮助推销了该社社员的药材六千多斤，大麻子一千斤，又帮助供给该社社员食盐三千八百斤，玉米四千五百斤，使该社整顿工作顺利完成，并发展了社员三百八十二人。
    根据河北省的经验，上级社对基层社的支持必须及时而且经常，不能在整顿过后便停止支持，否则，即便已经整顿后走上了正轨的基层社也不能巩固它的整社成果。如大兴县魏善庄联村社，在县社支持下经过整顿后营业额一度由一个集六十万元递增至一百七十万元。但在整顿之后，大兴县总社没有在业务上继续支持该联村社，在该社社员急需煤和玉米时，县社没有帮助解决，反而从该社五千斤玉米的股金中挪用了三千斤，使该社在业务上不能满足社员的需要，因此重新陷入不景气状态，营业额又降至一集六十四万元左右。
    上级社为了支持下级社，必须首先与基层社一样克服资本主义经营思想与经营方式，停止在自由市场作追求利润的活动。为此，河北省已有四十六个县社取消了门市部，集中力量进行采购、推销业务，帮助基层社满足社员需要。事实证明，上级社本身因基层社业务的开展，仅代购、代销的手续费，即可供其本身开支，不必依赖门市部赚钱来维持。其次，上、下级社业务关系密切后，利润分配便成为重要问题。衡水专区曾规定了各级合作社的最高毛利额如下：专区社百分之三，县社百分之五，村社百分之八。这种“上少下多”的规定，正是支持下级社的应有作法。该专区并规定：货物卖到社员手里，必须保证低于市价，贯彻基层社为社员服务的精神。此外，有些上、下级社间，实行了配售制和合同制，也在业务上帮助了基层社从事整顿工作。
    河北省重点整社工作，继改进业务之后，接着便整顿组织，贯彻民主办社的方针。在整顿组织中，一般都由社员自愿结合编定社员小组，选出组长与社员代表，然后召开社员代表会议，选举理监事，通过社章、订立各种制度，确定社务干部及其待遇，并制定业务计划。此后并定期公布账目，召开社员代表会和理监事会，总结检查业务。因为改进了业务，面向社员之后，社员得到了利益，对合作社便关心起来，整顿组织工作便容易做好。整顿了组织之后，合作社与社员的关系密切了，因此，动员社员来发展业务便比较容易。天津县北仓联村社在整顿后，为适应业务日益开展的需要，提出增加股金的要求。一天内就收到了为原有股金三分之一的新增股金。虽然这个地区是重灾区，但社员们高兴地说：“合作社是自己的，干部是亲手选的，哪能不支持。”
    目前河北省这些在业务上和组织上经过整顿后，走上正轨的合作社，有的已发展了社员，扩大了股金。据一百二十八个基层社的统计：整顿后平均增加社员百分之二十二点四，增加股金百分之二十七，营业额也显著提高。
