　　Cotton Farmers in Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, See Rising Living Standards
    Editor:
    The lives of the people in Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, have improved. In 1950, the whole village planted 5,147 mu of cotton, reaching 70 percent of the village's total cultivated land area. A total of 988,000 jin of cotton was harvested, which could be exchanged for more than 2.9 million jin of millet. After deducting food, clothing, and public grain, most farmers in the village had some surplus.
    After the farmers had a surplus from production, they first increased their capital in terms of production. Before the land reform, there were 140 waterwheels in the whole village of Zhoujiazhuang, but now there are 207. Old and weak livestock have been gradually eliminated, and strong livestock have gradually increased. In 1950, the whole village bought and exchanged a total of 129 head of livestock. Now that spring is approaching, the farmers of Zhoujiazhuang are organizing and repairing the irrigation wells, accumulating fertilizer, and the whole village has accumulated about 14,000 cartloads of earth fertilizer and bought 320,000 jin of soybean cake. People are happily preparing for the great production of 1951.
    The lives of the farmers in Zhoujiazhuang have seen a significant rise since the autumn of 1950. Some rich and middle-peasant families have been able to eat white flour and meat since the cotton harvest last autumn. During the winter, most families had stoves. In 1950, the whole village bought a total of more than 3,800 zhang of foreign cloth. Young women wore colorful sweaters, and children wore cloaks. In Zhoujiazhuang, these are all new things in history.

　　晋县周家庄棉农生活上升
    编辑同志：
    晋县周家庄人民的生活上升了。一九五○年全村共种棉花五一四七亩，达到全村耕地总面积的百分之七十。共收获棉花九十八万八千斤，可换回小米二百九十多万斤。除了吃用和缴公粮，村中一般农民都有了一些剩余。
    农民们生产有了剩余以后，首先在生产方面增加了资金。土地改革前，周家庄全村有水车一百四十辆，现在已增加到二百零七辆。老弱牲口被逐渐淘汰，健壮的牲畜逐渐增多。一九五○年，全村买进与换进牲口共一百二十九头。现在春天来临，周家庄的农民，正在整理浇地的水井，积肥，全村已积了约一万四千车土粪，买妥了三十二万斤豆饼。人们正欢天喜地准备着一九五一年的大生产。
    周家庄农民的生活，在一九五○年秋后有了显著的上升。一部分富、中农家庭，自去年秋天棉花收获后，常常可以吃到白面和肉类。过冬的时候，一般家庭都有了火炉。一九五○年全村买进洋布共有三千八百多丈，青年妇女们有穿着带色彩的毛衣的，小孩子们之间，也有穿起大氅的。在周家庄来说，这都是历史上的新事物。
