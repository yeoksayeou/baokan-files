　　The incident of the YingShang NanZhao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party suppressing criticism once again proves that implementing the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals throughout the Party requires arduous ideological struggle. It was clear that cadres had stolen winter clothing, but the NanZhao District Committee defended this vile and shameful behavior. It was clear that the criticism from Gao Jianyi could promote work, but the NanZhao District Committee regarded it as a destructive act that would "cause disunity among cadres," "affect cadre morale," and "affect production and disaster relief work." Although the NanZhao District Committee later made a self-criticism due to the instructions of the County Committee, it did not truly recognize its mistakes, and finally demanded of the critic: "If there are any problems in the future, they should be raised face-to-face, and not 'sue' to the newspaper, otherwise people will not know how our district work is done?!"

　　This makes it clear that the main reason why the NanZhao District Committee suppressed criticism was not only because they had not seen the Central Committee's decision on this issue (of course, it is also a serious problem that a District Committee does not know such an important decision of the Central Committee, and it is worth a serious inspection), nor was it only because they did not sufficiently understand the theft of winter clothing, but because they were unwilling for people to say that their work had shortcomings and mistakes, and thus protected their cadres without principle.

　　With this attitude to treat the shortcomings and errors in one's own work, it is impossible to understand the spirit of the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and it is impossible to understand that this kind of criticism and self-criticism is the most effective way to educate cadres.

　　We believe that the local Party committee should bravely admit the shortcomings and errors in their work, and set out effective methods for improvement; secondly, they should use this to educate cadres and party members, resolutely oppose the unwillingness of some party members and cadres to listen to the voices of the masses, not considering opinions from below, and being satisfied with their own complacency in their work.

　　Therefore, leading organs in various places should pay great attention to criticism from the masses, and local Party newspapers should welcome readers to submit such criticism manuscripts. It must be known that welcoming readers to make criticisms that are beneficial to the country's work on a regular basis is very beneficial to the people's cause.

### 反对压制批评，坚持自我批评

　　反对压制批评，坚持自我批评
    中共颍上南照区委压制批评的事件，再一次证明了要在全党实行中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定是需要一番艰苦的思想斗争。明明是干部偷换了寒衣，但南照区委却为此种恶劣可耻的行为进行辩护；明明对高建仪的这个批评可以推动工作前进，但南照区委把它当成一种“使干部不团结”、“影响干部情绪”、“影响生产救灾工作”的破坏行为。后来虽然南照区委因为县委的指示作了检讨，实际上并未真正认识自己的错误，最后仍要求批评者：“以后再有问题，应当当面提出，不要到报社‘告状’，不然人家不知道咱区工作怎搞的？！”
    这就很明白，南照区委所以压制批评，主要的不仅是因为有没有见到过中央关于这一问题的决定（当然一个区委对中央这样重要的决定都不知道，也是一个严重的问题，值得认真进行检查的），也不仅是因为他们对偷换寒衣认识不足，而是不愿意人家说自己工作有缺点有错误，因而无原则地袒护了自己的干部。
    以这种态度来对待自己工作中的缺点与错误，也就无法来领会中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定的精神，也就无法来了解这种批评和自我批评，是教育干部最有效的办法。
    我们认为当地党委应该勇敢地承认自己工作缺点和错误，并定出有效的改进的办法；其次并应以此来教育干部党员，坚决反对某些党员干部的不愿倾听群众呼声，不考虑自下面来的意见，而满足于自己工作的骄傲自满情绪。
    因此各地领导机关应当十分重视来自群众的批评，各地党报均应欢迎读者投寄此类批评稿件。必须知道，欢迎读者经常作有利于国家工作的批评，对人民事业是十分有利的。
