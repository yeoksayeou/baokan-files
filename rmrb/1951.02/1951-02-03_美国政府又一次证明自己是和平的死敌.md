The US imperialists used all their power to coerce their puppet states, and on January 30th at the UN Political and Security Committee and February 1st at the UN General Assembly, they passed, with a reluctant majority, their so-called proposal to "condemn Communist China as an aggressor in Korea." The entire Chinese people, all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, will express extreme indignation at the US imperialists' act of inverting black and white and unreasonably slandering China; at the same time, they will have a further understanding of the true face of US imperialism.

The US proposal tells the people of the world: US imperialism is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but continues to adhere to its policy of war and aggression. Since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea on June 25, 1950, and then invaded Taiwan, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated: resolving the Korean issue through peaceful negotiations based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the settlement of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves. On August 20 and 24, 1950, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government sent two telegrams to the Chairman of the UN Security Council, Malik, and later sent multiple telegrams to the UN Security Council, constantly proposing the withdrawal of US and other countries' troops from Korea, the withdrawal of US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to restore peace in the Far East and the world. On November 28, our representative Wu Xiuquan formally proposed to the Security Council to take effective measures immediately to completely withdraw the US government's armed aggression forces from Taiwan; and to withdraw all US and other foreign troops from Korea, with Korean internal affairs to be resolved by the North and South Korean people themselves, in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. After the US invading forces in Korea suffered heavy blows, and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army liberated Seoul, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, in his reply on January 17th to Abella, Chairman of the First Committee (i.e., the Political and Security Committee) of the UN General Assembly, reiterated the consistent position of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and proposed holding a seven-nation conference on the basis of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and resolving Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves, to negotiate a quick end to the Korean War and related issues in the Far East. On the 22nd of the same month, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in its reply to several inquiries from Indian Ambassador to China Panikkar regarding Foreign Minister Zhou's reply on January 17th, further clarified our attitude towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, pointing out that as long as the principle of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea is accepted and implemented, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will be responsible for persuading the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to return to their country, and propose two steps for ending the Korean War and peacefully mediating the Korean issue. This is the consistent position of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries firmly advocate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This position is also supported by the people of India and other Asian and Arab countries, as well as peace-loving people in European and American capitalist countries. The attitude of the United States, however, is the opposite. The United States has repeatedly delayed or even brazenly vetoed the proposals of China and the Soviet Union for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the UN Security Council, and US Secretary of State Acheson even issued a statement on January 17th, before the UN First Committee had announced the official translation of our reply, rejecting the peace proposal we put forward. The US House of Representatives and the Senate respectively passed and announced the so-called resolution "Communist China as an aggressor in Korea" on January 19th and 23rd. Its unreasonable attitude of resisting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was even considered "unexpected" by the reactionary US news agency United Press. Aren't these ironclad facts the most powerful proof that the United States is deliberately expanding the war and determined to be the enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, the Asian people, and the people of the world?

Although the UN Political and Security Committee passed the proposal to slander our country as an aggressor under the pressure of the United States, the process of discussing this slander case shows that the camp of US imperialism is not more consolidated because of this, but more divided, and US imperialism is more isolated. The US imperialist policy of insisting on war and aggression has clearly aroused the opposition of more people around the world. Moreover, its situation of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak has made the governments of some countries that have always followed the United States increasingly shaken and fearful. China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries' opposition to the US policy of aggression and war has been consistent. Now the majority of public opinion in India and some public opinion in Britain have also openly opposed US policy. The Hindustan Times said: "If the United States really wants to disregard China's proposals, then this is not helpful to the cause of peace." The National Herald said: "The recent discussions in the UN Political Committee give the impression that China wants peace and the United States does not want peace." The British Manchester Guardian accused the United States of "massively" existing "simply acting according to emotions and prejudices." "Reynold's News" said: "The current attempt to designate China as an aggressor and impose sanctions on it is a delusion seeking power that the United Nations does not currently possess." Representatives of many Asian and Arab countries also publicly criticized US policy at the UN Political and Security Committee. Indian representative Rau's opposition to the US proposal is well known. Egyptian representative Fawzi believed that the US proposal "seriously undermined and may close the remaining hope for a peaceful solution" (United Press). A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US proposal of endangering world peace. This situation has begun to be reflected in the "majority" manipulated by the United States in the United Nations. On January 30, although the US proposal was passed with a "majority" of forty-four votes, India and Burma voted against it along with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus. That is to say, countries representing more than 300 million people stood on the opposition side of the United States on the issue of opposing the US slander of China as an aggressor. At the time of the vote, there were also abstentions from countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia, and Egypt, which means that, in addition to the above-mentioned opponents, there were also Asian and African countries representing more than 100 million people who did not support the United States in this struggle. Therefore, in reality, the content of the "majority" manipulated by the United States has become increasingly empty.

The reason why the US government proposal is opposed by the majority of people around the world is that the content of this proposal is extremely absurd. Who is the aggressor in the Korean War, does it need to be explained? Is it the Korean people who went to the United States to carry out armed aggression, or threatened the security of the United States because they invaded the United States' neighbor? Or is it the US aggressive army that crossed the ocean of five thousand miles to carry out armed aggression in Korea and threatened China's security? Have any Chinese armed forces occupied the US Hawaiian Islands? Or has the US Seventh Fleet and its military personnel occupied China's territory Taiwan and controlled the Taiwan Strait? Is it the Chinese people or the Korean people who have created a no-man's land in the United States and destroyed peaceful towns and villages? Or are the US aggressive troops and planes arbitrarily slaughtering the Korean people in Korea and bombing and strafing the Chinese border? Who has made the Korean people separated from their wives and children, enduring hunger and cold in the severe cold of minus forty degrees? Who has helped the Korean people liberate their own land and gradually restore peaceful life? Who is hated by the Korean people to the bone, vowing to never coexist with them? Who has shown the great friendship of internationalism to the Korean people and is loved by the Korean people? Is it the peace-loving people of the world, including the American people, who oppose the US government's aggression against Korea? Or is it the people of the world who oppose the Chinese people's assistance to the Korean people? The discerning eyes of the people of the world can see clearly, and the absurd and shameless proposal of the US government to attempt to reverse black and white cannot change the truth of the facts, but only make the people of the world more aware of the brutality and shamelessness of US imperialism.

The US government's slanderous proposal cannot delay the victory of the Chinese people's voluntary action to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homeland. It will not gain anything except to more deeply expose the aggressive ambitions of the United States, and thus make the United States more isolated. Even the reactionary US New York Times, after the US proposal was passed, commented with extreme frustration on January 31: This proposal will not work. Because it "cannot be expected" to "end the Korean War," "cannot solve the various Far East problems that have not yet been resolved," nor can it "change" the "military and economic situation" of the Chinese People's Government.

In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Chinese people have never had any illusions about US imperialism, and have always relied on their own strength to oppose US imperialism's aggression. Since US imperialism is determined to continue its aggression, the task of the Chinese people is to carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea more deeply and universally, and to unite international friends more widely, to fight to the end to completely smash US imperialism's aggression against Korea and China.

### 美国政府又一次证明自己是和平的死敌

　　美国政府又一次证明自己是和平的死敌
    美帝国主义用了一切力量胁迫其仆从国家，在一月三十日的联合国政治与安全委员会及二月一日的联合国大会上，以勉强的多数，通过了它所提出的所谓“谴责共产党中国为在朝鲜的侵略者”的提案。全中国人民，全亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民，对于美帝国主义这种颠倒黑白、横蛮无理地诬蔑中国的行为，会表示万分的愤慨；同时，也将因此对于美帝国主义的真正面目有了进一步的认识。
    美国提案向全世界人民表示：美帝国主义是不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题，而继续坚持其战争和侵略政策的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府自美国于一九五○年六月二十五日发动侵略朝鲜的战争接着就侵略台湾以来，一直就主张：在一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上，用和平谈判的方法解决朝鲜问题的。一九五○年八月二十日及二十四日我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来致联合国安全理事会主席马立克的两次电报，及以后多次致联合国安全理事会的电报，都不断提出美国及其他国家的军队撤出朝鲜、美国武装力量撤出台湾及台湾海峡以恢复远东与世界的和平的主张。十一月二十八日，我国代表伍修权曾正式向安理会提出建议，主张立即采取有效措施，使美国政府自台湾完全撤出它的武装侵略力量；并使美国及其他外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政由南北朝鲜人民自己解决，以和平处理朝鲜问题。在美国侵朝军队连遭痛击，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队光复汉城以后，我外交部部长周恩来又于本年一月十七日在对联合国大会第一委员会（即政治与安全委员会）主席阿彼拉兹所要求的先停战后谈判的复电中，申明中华人民共和国中央人民政府和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，并建议在从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上举行七国会议，以谈判迅速结束朝鲜战争及远东有关问题。在同月的二十二日，我外交部在对印度驻华大使潘尼迦所提关于周外长一月十七日复电中几点询问的答复中，更进一步阐明了我国对和平解决朝鲜问题的态度，指出只要一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的原则被接受后，并付诸实施，中华人民共和国中央人民政府将负责劝说中国人民志愿部队回到本国，并提出停止朝鲜战争与和平调处朝鲜问题的两个步骤。这就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张。苏联及各人民民主国家，都坚决主张朝鲜问题的和平解决。这种主张也同时为印度与其他亚洲和阿剌伯多数国家的人民及欧美资本主义各国爱好和平的人民所赞成。而美国的态度，则与此相反。美国不但在联合国安理会中，一再拖延或竟悍然否决中苏两国和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，而且美国国务卿艾奇逊竟在一月十七日当联合国第一委员会尚未公布我国复电的正式译文的时候，便发表声明，拒绝接受我国所提的和平建议。美国众议院和参议院于一月十九日和二十三日分别通过和宣布了所谓“共产党中国为在朝鲜的侵略者”的决议。其抗拒和平解决朝鲜问题的蛮横无理态度，连美国反动的通讯社合众社也认为“出人意料”。这些铁的事实，不是最有力地证明美国是蓄意扩大战争，决心与中朝人民、亚洲人民及世界人民为敌吗？
    联合国政治与安全委员会虽然在美国的压力下通过了诬蔑我国为侵略者的提案，但讨论这个诬蔑案的过程表示：美帝国主义的阵营不是因此更加巩固了，而是更加分裂了，美帝国主义是更加孤立了。美帝国主义坚持战争、坚持侵略的政策，很显然已引起全世界更多的人民的反对。而且它那种外强中干的状况，已使若干一向追随美国的国家的政府，日益动摇和恐惧。中国、苏联及人民民主国家之反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策是一贯的。现在印度的多数舆论以及英国的某些舆论也已公开反对美国政策了。印度斯坦时报说：“假若美国真要不顾中国的建议，那末这对和平事业是没有用处的。”国民先驱报说：“最近联合国政委会的讨论给人一种印象，即：中国要和平而美国不要和平。”英国曼彻斯特卫报指责美国“大量存在”着“单纯地依照感情和偏见行事”。“雷诺新闻”说：“目前指中国为侵略者并对之施以制裁的企图，乃是妄想企求于联合国现在所未具有的权力。”许多亚洲及阿剌伯国家的代表在联合国政委会上也公开批评美国的政策。印度代表劳氏之反对美国提案，是人所共见的。埃及代表法齐认为美国提案“严重地破坏了并可能封闭了和平解决的残余希望”（合众社）。印尼外交部的发言人指责美国提案危害世界和平。这种情况，已经开始反映在美国在联合国所操纵的“多数”上。一月三十日，美国提案虽然以四十四票的“多数”通过了，但印度和缅甸却与苏联、波兰、捷克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯五国一道投了反对票。这就是说，又有代表三亿以上的人口的国家，在反对美国诬蔑中国为侵略者的问题上，站在美国的反对方面了。表决时，还有巴基斯坦、印尼、埃及等国的弃权，就是说，在上述反对者之外，还有代表一亿以上人口的亚、非国家，在这一个斗争中，不支持美国了。因此，从实际上讲来，美国所操纵的“多数”的内容，已经愈来愈空虚了。
    美国政府提案之所以受到全世界大多数人民的反对，因为这一提案的内容是极端荒谬的。在朝鲜战争中究竟谁是侵略者，难道还用说明吗？是朝鲜人民到美国去实行武装侵略，或者因为侵略了美国的邻国而威胁到美国的安全呢？还是美国的侵略军队越过五千英里的大洋而到朝鲜实行武装侵略并威胁了中国的安全呢？是中国的任何武装力量侵占了美国的夏威夷呢？还是美国的第七舰队及其军事人员侵占了中国的领土台湾并控制了台湾海峡呢？是中国人民或朝鲜人民在美国造成了无人区并毁灭了和平的城镇与乡村呢？还是美国的侵略军队和飞机在朝鲜任意屠杀朝鲜人民并轰炸和扫射了中国的边境呢？是谁使得朝鲜人民妻离子散，在零下四十度严寒中忍受着饥寒？是谁帮助了朝鲜人民解放了他们自己的国土并在逐步恢复和平生活呢？是谁为朝鲜人民所切齿痛恨，誓与之不共戴天？是谁对朝鲜人民表现了国际主义的伟大友情，并为朝鲜人民所热爱呢？是世界爱好和平的人民包括美国人民在内反对美国政府侵略朝鲜呢？还是世界人民反对中国人民对于朝鲜人民的援助呢？世界人民的雪亮的眼睛是看得清清楚楚的，美国政府企图颠倒黑白的荒谬无耻的提案绝不能改变事实的真象，只有使全世界人民更加认识美国帝国主义之残暴无耻而已。
    美国政府的诬蔑提案丝毫不能延缓中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动的胜利，它除掉更深刻地暴露美国的侵略野心，因而也就更加使美国孤立外，不会有任何收获。连美国反动的纽约时报在美国提案通过后于一月三十一日也异常沮丧地发表评论说：这次提案不会发生作用。因为既“不能期望”它“结束朝鲜战争”，“不能解决尚未得到解决的各种远东问题”，也不能“改变”中国人民政府的“军事和经济的情况”。
    中国人民在抗美援朝运动中，从来对于美帝国主义就不存任何幻想，从来就是依靠自己的力量，以反对美帝国主义的侵略。美帝国主义既然决心侵略下去，中国人民的任务，就在于更深入更普遍地开展抗美援朝运动，更广泛地团结国际友人，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义对朝鲜、对中国的侵略而奋斗到底。
