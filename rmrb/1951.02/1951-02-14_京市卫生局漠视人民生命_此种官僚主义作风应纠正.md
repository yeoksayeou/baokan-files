　　Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Disregards People's Lives
　  This Bureaucratic Work Style Should Be Corrected
    Editor:
    The Municipal Health Bureau has shown an insufficiently responsible attitude towards the lives of the people. The matter transpired as follows: On January 25th, sixteen residents of Li Shiming's household in Xihongmen, Nanjiao, suffered poisoning from accidentally consuming poison. The Nanjiao Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, after learning of this before 4:30 PM that day, immediately requested Doctor Zhu from the Nanyuan Medical Cooperative to provide treatment, and simultaneously contacted the Municipal Health Bureau requesting them to send someone quickly to provide treatment. We first called the Second Section of the Health Bureau, who told us to call the Section Chief's office. When we called the Section Chief's office, they in turn told us to call the Epidemic Prevention Team. By the time we called the Epidemic Prevention Team, it was already after 5 o'clock. Doctor Zhang Ruqin of the Epidemic Prevention Team, after speaking with us, told us to find the Nanyuan Clinic. We explained to him that the Nanyuan Medical Cooperative had few personnel and poor equipment and could not solve the problem. He then told us to find the Nanyuan Health Center. We said, "The Health Center has no telephone and no fast means of transportation, and it is 25 *li* from Xihongmen. We fear that this delay will endanger lives." Doctor Zhang said, "Then you contact the Second Section of the Health Bureau!" We replied, "We have already contacted them, and the Second Section told us to find you." Upon hearing this, Doctor Zhang, having no other option, said, "You wait! I will talk to the Second Section and call you back if there is a solution." By 5:30 PM, Doctor Zhang called to say, "Someone has been dispatched by car." Only then did we breathe a sigh of relief. However, by 6 o'clock, the Epidemic Prevention Team had not yet arrived (Nanyuan is about 30 *li* from the Municipal Health Bureau), and by this time one person had already died. At 6:40 PM, when we called to urge them, Team Leader Li of the team said, "The medical team left ten minutes ago." They didn't arrive until 7:10 PM, by which time the condition of the remaining fifteen people was already extremely critical.
    We feel that the Health Bureau's delaying, evasive, indifferent attitude towards people's lives, and its bureaucratic approach to work, are very wrong and should be examined and corrected.
                                      Beijing Municipal Nanjiao Public Security Branch

    Editor's Note: The Municipal Health Bureau should correct this bureaucratic work style and further improve its working methods, establish a clear division of labor and responsibility system, so that when similar medical tasks arrive, there will be no more mutual shunting and harmful delays.

### 京市卫生局漠视人民生命  此种官僚主义作风应纠正

　　京市卫生局漠视人民生命
　  此种官僚主义作风应纠正
    编辑同志：
    本市卫生局对人民生命表现了不够负责的态度，事情经过是这样的：一月二十五日，南郊西红门住户李世明家有十六人因误吃毒药中毒。市公安局南郊分局于当日下午四时半以前得知后，即一面请南苑医药合作社朱大夫前往救治，一面与市卫生局联系请其速派人前往救治。我们先给卫生局二科打电话，他们让叫科长室，给科长室打电话时又让叫防疫队，等我们再给防疫队打电话时，已经是五点多了。经该防疫队张如琴大夫接谈，让我们找南苑诊疗所。我们向他说明南苑医药合作社人员少，设备差，不能解决问题。他又叫找南苑卫生所。我们说：“卫生所没电话，又无快的交通工具，距西红门有二十五里，恐耽误了有生命危险。”张大夫说：“那么你和卫生局二科联系吧！”我们回答：“已联系过，二科叫找你们。”张大夫一听没办法了才说：“你们等着吧！我和二科谈去，有办法了给你们打电话。”到五点半钟张大夫来电话说：“已派人坐汽车去了。”我们这才松了一口气。但是，到了六点防疫队还没到（南苑距市卫生局约三十里），这时已有一个人死了。六点四十分我们打电话催时，该队李队长说：“医疗队已走了十分钟。”直到七点十分才到，其余十五人病情已经十分危险。
    我们觉得卫生局这种拖延、支吾、对人民生命漠不关心的态度及工作中的官僚主义，是非常不对的，应该检查纠正。
                                      北京市南郊公安分局
    编者按：市卫生局应该纠正这种官僚主义的工作作风，并进一步改进工作方法，建立明确的分工负责制度，使类似医疗任务到来时，不致再有互相推脱，误事害人的现象发生。
