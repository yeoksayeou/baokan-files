Shanghai Certain Private Copper Smelting Factories
Adding Phosphorus to Copper Wire Production
Seriously Endangering the Development of the Electrical Industry

Editor:

Recently, certain private copper smelting factories in Shanghai, in order to increase the toughness of copper wire to facilitate sales and profits, have been adding phosphorus during the casting of copper ingots. This has reduced the conductivity of the copper wire, affecting the performance of various electrical appliances made with this phosphorus-containing wire, and seriously damaging the interests of the nation.

Since the liberation of the entire country, the need for electrical wire has been increasing daily, and foreign imports have decreased. Therefore, the copper smelted and the wire drawn by the Chinese people themselves have played a significant role in the nation's construction. Currently, the manufacturing of domestic copper wire involves both electrolytic refining, with a chemical composition reaching 99.9%, and fire refining without electrolysis, resulting in a chemical composition of only 98%. However, some private copper smelting factories, because the oxygen content in electrolytic copper cannot be completely removed, making the wire brittle and prone to breaking during drawing and winding, add a small amount of phosphorus during the casting of copper ingots after the electrolytic copper is made. The purpose is to remove oxygen, giving the finished wire a certain degree of toughness. But copper wire is most sensitive to phosphorus. If it contains 0.07% phosphorus, the conductivity of the copper wire will drop from 100% to 60%. If it contains 0.15% phosphorus, the conductivity will decrease to 42%. Several factories manufacturing electric motors and electrical switches have purchased phosphorus-containing copper wire on the market, resulting in reduced conductivity, excessively high temperatures, and significant energy loss in the finished products. Furthermore, because the phosphorus is not added evenly, the resistance of different sections of the wire varies, causing the finished products to fail inspection and resulting in significant losses. A certain electrical appliance factory in East China purchased a batch of copper wire in Shanghai to make transformers, but the copper wire contained phosphorus, resulting in losses of over ten billion yuan. What's worse, phosphorus-containing copper wire cannot be completely purified by remelting it, because dephosphorization is an extremely complex process in metallurgy. China produces very little copper, and there is not much scrap copper in circulation among the people. It is truly an unforgivable waste of resources for private manufacturers to add phosphorus in such an absurd way during copper smelting. The Electrical Industry Division of the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department has taken notice of this: they have warned all copper smelting and wire manufacturing factories not to repeat these harmful acts in the future. At the same time, they hope that all agencies and factories purchasing electrical wire must require manufacturers to provide guarantees that no phosphorus has been added, and must test the conductivity of the copper wire. The conductivity of hard copper wire should reach 96% to be considered合格 (qualified); the conductivity of annealed soft copper wire should reach 98% to be considered 合格 (qualified). We hope that the industrial departments of all major administrative regions will pay attention to this issue and investigate and eliminate these firms that destroy national wealth.

Editor's Note: The act of certain manufacturers in Shanghai adding phosphorus to copper ingots will seriously affect the interests of the nation, which is intolerable. Please, East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department, thoroughly investigate this matter, and we hope that the broad masses of workers and staff can report these illegal manufacturers so as to eradicate this destructive behavior.

Model Military Family Member Song Deyang

Song Deyang, a military family member from Hongcaopao Village, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, worked as a hired laborer for over twenty years. Before land reform, he had no house or land. After the Communist Party came, he was allocated 16.8 mu of land. Three years of production have made his family's life quite prosperous. His younger brother joined the Chinese People's Navy. Song Deyang was elected as a military family representative by the military families in the village. He made a plan for the whole family's production. He said, "Eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, it's poor planning that makes you poor."

Song Deyang's family has seven members (including his brother in the army): his wife is forty-nine years old, his eldest son is twelve years old, his youngest son is seven years old, and his daughter is sixteen years old. No one in the family is idle. Adults do adult work, and children do children's work. His wife and daughter weave mats, working late into the night (11 pm), weaving one and a half mats each day. His daughter attends winter school for two hours each day, learning two characters each night. The family guarantees to weave 180 mats during the entire winter (four months), and they have already woven 100 mats. By the lunar new year, they will weave another 20 mats, earning 28.8 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below). After deducting the cost of raw materials, they will earn 14.4 million yuan.

Song Deyang goes out to "string" reeds for others, earning 60,000 yuan per day. Besides stringing his own reeds at home in the evening, he also helps the family weave mats. During the entire winter, he can earn 7.2 million yuan, bringing the family's total income to 21.6 million yuan. The eldest son and second son are also not idle during the winter vacation, going out to collect manure every day. In this way, the whole family, men, women, old, and young, work together and vigorously engage in sideline production. What will they do with the money earned from sideline production? Song Deyang said, "I love cows because they collect a lot of manure and can work. Without livestock, the land cannot be cultivated well. If we raise livestock, we will raise dairy cows. A dairy cow gives birth to a dairy cow, and in three years we will have five cows!" Therefore, he plans to use over ten million yuan to buy a large cow. Because they are busy stringing reeds and weaving mats, they have not yet gathered enough firewood. He plans to not rest during the New Year, and after the second day of the lunar new year, he will go to the pond to gather firewood to gather enough firewood for the whole year.

He plans the following for agricultural production next year: 10.8 mu of land (including 4 mu of low-lying land). He will plant wheat on the 4 mu of low-lying land. An early harvest brings early benefits, and he can also harvest two "zha" (harvest one "zha" of beans). He will plant one mu of kenaf. If he takes care of it well, one mu can be worth two mu of farmland. He will plant "Zuanxin Hong" sorghum (heavier weight, 40 jin per "dou," with high oil content) on the remaining 5.8 mu of land. He has prepared 200 jin of wheat seeds and 50 jin of sorghum seeds. Both the wheat seeds and sorghum seeds have been tested to ensure they can germinate. He also plans to disinfect them with copper sulfate and mix them with blood meal because doing so will prevent the crops from developing smut and ensure the seedlings grow vigorously, resulting in a higher grain yield.

Song Deyang has high prestige in the village. Since his production plan spread in the village, the masses nodded and said, "His plan is not false at all. He says it and he can do it. We all have to learn from him!"

Peasants Welcome New Year Pictures

The market in Zunhua County before the Spring Festival is very different from previous years.

This is a county town located more than twenty li from the Great Wall. Mountain products and local products from villages hundreds of li outside the Great Wall are transported here for distribution. This year is a year of bumper harvest, and there are even more people going to the market. One very prominent feeling I have at the market is that in previous years, the most vendors at the December market were selling New Year's paper (Kitchen God, Door Gods). According to statistics from 1943, there were over a hundred vendors selling New Year's paper at the December market. But this year, there are only thirty-two, and most of them are old and dilapidated stock. In previous years, the price of New Year's paper always rose market after market, but this year it has been falling market after market. The reason is that very few people are buying them. For example, at the January 11th market, there were sixteen vendors selling New Year's paper, but they didn't sell a single one all day. Wang Jinlu, a peasant from Dongbeihe Village, said, "My family worshiped the Kitchen God and the God of Wealth for twenty years, but they never made us rich. Only when the Communist Party came and we were given land, and we stepped up production, did we finally have enough to eat and wear." There are fewer vendors selling New Year's paper, and more vendors selling New Year's pictures. Fourteen of them used to sell New Year's paper and have now switched professions. The New Year's pictures featuring the great portrait of Chairman Mao are the most popular. Secondly, the "Tractor" painted by Li Qi of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House is also being snapped up by the peasants. They point to the tractor and say, "When will our village be able to use this thing?" The vendor selling New Year's pictures replies, "With the leadership of Chairman Mao, there's nothing to worry about." The local Xinhua Bookstore has sold more than 3,200 New Year's pictures in the past half month.

Shanxi Changzhi Beipo Village, Cooperative Establishes Prestige

Beipo Village in the fifth district of Changzhi is a small mountain village with 138 households. Most of the village is mountainous, and each person has an average of only 2.69 mu of land. In a good year, each person can harvest about two "shi" of coarse grains, which is not even enough to eat. Therefore, most of the peasants make a living by making nails, transporting goods, and working in coal mines to supplement their income. There is a cooperative in the village, which in the past focused on profit and had a poor relationship with the masses. The nails that the masses made still had to be taken to Yin City, fifteen li away, to sell, and then they had to bring back the items they needed. The reorganization of the society began in early October of last year, focusing on how to adapt to the production needs of the masses, promote the products of the masses, supply the raw materials of the masses, and solve the production difficulties of the masses. As many households in the village make iron nails, the cooperative first signed an iron industry contract with the Yin City Trading Company, taking back bar iron to supply to the masses. The masses make good nails and hand them over to the supply and marketing cooperative. They can exchange them for iron, salt, cloth, oil, or cash. At first, the masses were prejudiced against the cooperative because of their past impressions, thinking that this was "trapping people," so they were still willing to go to Yin City to sell their nails themselves. However, the supply and marketing cooperative can exchange one "jin" of nails for 3.12 "jin" of iron, while the peasants themselves can only exchange it for 3.5 "jin" in Yin City, and they also have to lose a day's work. Slowly, they all believed that the supply and marketing cooperative was really serving the masses. From October 15th to the end of December, the cooperative supplied the village's 42 iron furnace households with 4,880 "jin" of bar iron and sold 2,580 "jin" of nails. The selling price of each "jin" of nails is 3,200 yuan. 2,580 "jin" of nails are worth 8,256,000 yuan in total. After deducting the iron price of 4,163,200 yuan, the masses gained a profit of 4,093,800 yuan. Now the cooperative has established prestige among the masses. Some people say: "If I don't have salt at home, I can exchange four "liang" of nails for it. If I don't have flour, I can exchange it for flour. If I don't have oil, I can exchange it for oil. If I want cloth, I can get cloth. It's really convenient!" The blacksmith Song Liu said: "If it weren't for the supply and marketing cooperative selling things for me every month, I would have made eighteen "jin" fewer nails this month. Buying food in the city costs at least three "sheng" of rice every day!"

Ren Qianhu's Agricultural and Sideline Production - Letter from Labor Model Ren Zhan'ao

Editor:

In the nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, the cadres and masses of our village (Ren Qianhu Village) are determined to do a good job in production to strengthen our economic construction and national defense construction. Now I will report on the work in our village to you:

(1) The winter production of our village is mainly making straw bags. There are more than 50 straw bag machines in the village, and the daily output of straw bags is 150. Each is worth 3 "jin" of millet, and making straw bags every day can bring in 450 "jin" of millet. The second is accumulating fertilizer. As of December 29th, we have accumulated more than 400,000 "jin" of fertilizer; transportation earns 6,300 "jin" of millet; picking firewood earns 18,700 "jin" of millet.

(2) In terms of mutual aid teams, all 132 households in our village, 123 male laborers, and 149 female laborers have joined the mutual aid teams. A total of 28 teams have been freely formed. Now the mutual aid teams in our village are working very enthusiastically. For example, Ren Weiyuan's team of six households bought a horse; Zhang Wenfang's team of two households bought a horse; Ren Dengge's team of three households bought two donkeys; everyone is actively preparing to welcome the 1951 great production competition. In the future, we will do everything we can to drive the mutual aid organizations in neighboring villages to make our mutual aid more consolidated.

(3) For this year's spring plowing, all 132 households in the village plan to plant 150 mu of wheat and 220 mu of dehydrated late wheat land, totaling 370 mu of wheat. Each mu will be fertilized with 1,000 "jin" of fertilizer. The seed problem has now been completely solved by various sideline occupations, and there is no need for government seed loans. In addition, the Technical Research Committee of our village has researched a method of mixing wheat seeds with lard. Because the dehydrated land is late, manure cannot be delivered in advance, so we have to use the oil mixing seed method. This method is fast and saves money, and the seedlings that emerge are black and lush, and can also reduce common diseases. We have achieved great results.

Sincerely,

Respectfully!

    上海某些私营炼铜厂
    制铜线时搀入磷质
    严重危害电业建设
    编辑同志：
    最近上海某些私营的炼铜工厂，为了增加铜线的韧性，便于出售牟利，竟在浇制铜锭时加进磷质，因而降低了电线的导电率，影响到用这种含磷电线制成的各种电器的性能，严重地损害了国家利益。
    自全国解放以来，电线的需要日益增大，国外来货又减少，因此中国人民自己炼的铜和拉制的电线，在国家的建设事业上起了很大的作用。现在国内铜线的制造，一部分经过电解，化学成分达到九九点九，一部只用火炼，不经过电解，化学成分只达九八。但目前有些私营炼铜工厂，为了电解铜里面氧的成分提不干净，线的性质脆，拉线和绕曲时容易断，即在做成电解铜之后，在浇制铜锭时加入少数的磷，目的在去氧，使制成的电线获得一定的韧性。但铜线最怕含磷，如含有万分之七的磷，铜线的导电率就要从百分之百降到百分之六十，如含有万分之十五的磷，铜线的导电率就要降低到百分之四二。现在有好几家制造电动机及电器开关的工厂，因为在市上买到含磷的铜线，制成成品后导电率降低，温度特高，耗损很大。又因磷加的不匀，各段电线的电阻不一，制成的成品检验不合格，受了极大的损失。华东某电器厂在上海买了一批铜线，准备做变压器，但因为铜线含磷，损失达十余亿元。更糟糕的是，含磷的铜线，如回炉熔化，也不能将磷除净，因为去磷在冶金方面是一种极复杂的过程。我国产铜甚少，存在民间的废铜也不多，私营厂商竟在炼铜时这样荒谬地加用磷素，真是糟蹋资源至不可宽恕的地步。现在华东军政委员会工业部电器工业处对此已引起注意：一面警告各炼铜制线厂今后不要再做这些坏事；同时希望各购买电线的机关和工厂，在购料时必须要求制造厂提供不搀磷的保证，并一定要检验铜线的导电率。凡硬铜线的导电率以达百分之九六为合格；经过韧炼的软铜线的导电率以达百分之九十八为合格。我们希望各大行政区的工业部，必须同时注意并检查取缔这种破坏国家财富的厂商。
                       中央人民政府重工业部新闻报导组
    编者按：上海某些厂商在铜锭中搀磷的行为，将严重地影响国家的利益，这是使人不能容忍的。请华东军政委员会工业部彻查这件事，并希望广大的工人职员能对这些不法厂商进行检举，以便根绝此种破坏性的行为。

            模范军属宋德阳
    辽东营口县红草泡村军属宋德阳，过去抗了二十余年大活，土地改革前房无一间、地无一垅，共产党来后他分得了十六亩八分地，三年来的生产，使家庭生活已变得相当的富裕了。弟弟参加了中国人民海军。宋德阳被村里的军属们选为军属代表。他把全家的生产做了个计划，他说：“吃不穷、穿不穷、计划不到才受穷。”
    宋德阳全家七口人（连参军的弟弟在内），老婆四十九岁，大儿子十二岁，小儿子七岁，女儿十六岁，全家没有一个闲人。大人干大人的活，小孩干小孩的活。老婆和女儿织席子，每晚掌灯织到小半夜（十一时），每天织出丈席一张半。女儿每天上两个钟头冬学，一天晚上学会两个字，全家在整个冬季里（四个月）保证织出丈席一百八十张，现已织出一百张，到阴历年还要织出二十张，能收入两千八百八十万元（东北币，下同），除去原料钱，赚一千四百四十万元。
    宋德阳出外给人家“串”苇子，一天能赚六万元，除晚上在家串自己的苇子外，还帮助家里织席子，在整个冬季里能赚钱七百二十万元，计全家能收入两千一百六十万元。大儿子与二儿子在寒假期间也不闲着，每天出外面拣粪，这样全家男女老少齐动手，大力搞副业，副业生产赚来钱留着做什么呢？宋德阳说：“我就喜爱牛，因为采粪多，能干活，没有牲口地就种不好，要养活就养活乳牛，乳牛下乳牛，三年就五个头！”因此他准备用一千多万元买一头大牛。由于忙于串苇子和织席子，所以到现在柴火还没打够；他计划过年也不歇着，过了初二就下塘打柴火，把全年的柴火打够。
    来年的农业生产他这样计划：十亩八分地（洼地四亩），四亩洼地种小麦，早收早得济，还能收两楂（收一楂豆子），种一亩地洋麻，侍弄得好，一亩能顶二亩大田。其余五亩八分地种“钻心红”高粱（分量较重，一斗四十斤，出米油性大），已准备好二百斤麦种，五○斤高粱种，麦种和高粱种都是经过试验能发芽的，他还准备用王铜消毒，用血粉拌种，因为这样做庄稼不出乌米，小苗长的旺，能够多打粮食。
    宋德阳在村中威信很高，自从他的生产计划在村中传开后，群众点头说：“人家计划一点也不假，说了就能作到，咱们大家得跟人家学！”

            农民欢迎新年画
    遵化县城在春节前的集市，比往年大不相同了。
    这是一座距长城二十余里的县城。长城外百余里村的山货、土产都运到此地集散。今年是丰收年，赶集人更多了。在集上给我一个很突出的感觉是往年腊月集上卖年纸（灶王、门神）的最多，根据一九四三年统计，腊月集上卖年纸的有百余家；但在今年腊月集上，却只有三十二家，其中且多是破旧不堪的陈货。往年年纸的价格总是集集上涨，但今年则是逐集跌价。原因是买的人很少。像在一月十一日集上有十六家卖年纸的，他们整天一张也没有卖出去。东?河庄农民王进禄说：“我家供二十年灶王、财神也没发过财，只有共产党来了，分得了土地，加紧生产，现在才有吃、有穿。”卖年纸的少了，卖新年画的可多了。其中有十四家是过去卖年纸的转业户。新年画以有伟大的毛主席像最受人欢迎。其次是人民美术出版社的李琦画“拖拉机”也被农民抢着买。他们指着拖拉机说：“咱村啥时能使用这家伙？”卖年画的回答说：“有毛主席的领导还用发愁。”当地新华书店在半个月来卖出了新年画三千二百多张。

            山西长治北坡村  合作社树立起威信
    长治五区北坡村是一个一百三十八户的小山庄，该村大部是山地，每人平均只有二亩六分九厘地，遇到好年景，每人可收粗粮二石左右，连吃也不够。所以农民大部是以打钉子，搞运输，下煤窑赚钱来补助生活。村里有个合作社，过去专以营利为目的，和群众关系不大好，群众打下的钉子还得亲自跑十五里路远的荫城去卖，再捎回自己需用的物品。去年十月上旬开始整社，以如何适应群众生产需要，推销群众产品，供给群众原料，解决群众的生产困难为主。按该村打铁钉户很多，合作社就先和荫城贸易公司订了铁业合同，取回条铁供给群众，群众打好钉子，交到供销社，想换铁，换盐、换布、换油或要现钱都可以。最先群众思想上因对合作社有成见，以为这是在“套人”，所以有钉子还是愿自己到荫城去卖，但供销社一斤钉子可换三斤十二两铁，农民自己到荫城才换上三斤半，还得误一天工，这样慢慢地才都相信了供销社，实在是替群众服务。从十月十五号至十二月底统计二月半时间，该社共供给全村四十二户铁炉条铁四千八百八十斤，代销出钉子二千五百八十斤。每斤钉子售价三千二百元，二千五百八十斤钉子共值八百二十五万六千元，除去铁价四百一十六万三千二百元外，群众共得利四百九十三万零八百元。现在合作社已在群众中建立了威信。有人说：“家里没盐吃，取上四两钉子就换上了，没面就换面，没油换油，要布就有布，这可真方便呀！”铁匠松刘说：“要不是供销社每月代我出卖东西，这个月就得少打十八斤钉子。在城里买吃的，每天最少也得三升米呢！”

            任千户的农副业生产——劳动模范任占鳌来信
    编辑同志：
    在全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，我村（任千户村）的干部和群众决心努力搞好生产，以加强我们的经济建设和国防建设。现在我把我们村里的工作向你们报告一下：
    （一）我村的冬季生产，是以打草袋为主。全村现有草袋机五十多架，每天草袋的产量为一百五十个，每个价值小米三斤，每天打草袋可以收入小米四百五十斤。其次是积肥，截至十二月二十九日，共积肥四十余万斤；搞运输赚小米六千三百斤；拾柴赚小米一万八千七百斤。
    （二）在互助组方面，我村一百三十二户人家，一百二十三个男劳动力，一百四十九个女劳动力，都参加了互助组。共自由结合起来二十八个小组。现在我村的互助组干的特别起劲，如任维远组共六户，买马一匹；张文芳组二户，买马一匹；任登阁组三户，买驴两头；大家都在积极准备迎接一九五一年的大生产竞赛。今后我们要尽一切的力量来带动邻村的互助组织，把我们的互助更加巩固起来。
    （三）今年的春耕，全村一百三十二户人家，准备种麦子一百五十亩，脱水晚麦地二百二十亩，总计种麦三百七十亩。每亩上肥一千斤，种子问题现在由各种各样副业已全部解决了，不用政府的贷种。另外，我村技术研究委员会，研究了一种猪油拌麦种方法，因脱水地晚不能提前送粪，只得使油拌种方法。这个办法又快又省钱，苗芽出来时候又黑又茂盛，还能减去一般的瘟病，我们已获得很大的效果。
        此致
    敬礼！
                      河北宁河县任千户村  任占鳌
