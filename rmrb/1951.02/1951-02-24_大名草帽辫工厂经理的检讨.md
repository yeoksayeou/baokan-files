Response to Criticism and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　The Self-Criticism of the Manager of the Daming Straw Braid Factory

　　To the Editors:

　　After seeing the criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 25th, "The Bureaucratic Work Style of the Manager of the Daming Straw Braid Factory in Hebei Urgently Needs Correction," we conducted a self-examination of our thinking. We sincerely accept the Party newspaper's criticism of us and are determined to correct this irresponsible attitude towards state property and the people in our future work. We now report the results of our self-examination to you:

　　I. We have both been working for twelve or thirteen years, but we have not yet truly established the idea of serving the people. Therefore, we often act like "old timers," displaying pride and complacency in our actions, with an undemocratic work style and insincere attitude. For example, when union cadres make reasonable suggestions regarding production, we do not accept them with a humble attitude. In our hearts, we always think: What do you union cadres amount to?! We often ignore the opinions of workers or union cadres.

　　II. Due to our existing bureaucratic work style, we are unable and unwilling to mobilize workers to participate in the management of the factory, and we mistakenly believe that the supply and marketing cooperative's engagement in production is a "bestowal" and "relief" to the workers. Of course, we cannot even talk about caring for the welfare of the workers. The obstruction of union cadres from attending worker training classes is indeed true. Now we realize that this is an infringement of the workers' political rights and a matter of principle.

　　III. Because we have consistently failed to study diligently, spending all day circling around administrative work, we fundamentally do not understand the management of the factory. We have not studied documents on factory management or the laws and policies promulgated by the government, such as the Trade Union Law. In general, we have incorrect work styles and attitudes in our leadership, resembling those of capitalists towards workers.

　　The above is our self-criticism. We hope the editors will publish it. If you think it is not profound enough, we hope you will point it out for further self-examination.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　大名草帽辫工厂经理的检讨
    编辑同志：
    我们见到人民日报一月二十五日“读者来信”栏刊载“河北大名草帽辫工厂经理官僚主义作风亟应纠正”的批评后，进行了思想检查，诚心接受党报对我们的批评，并决心在今后工作中纠正这种对国家财产和对人民不负责任的态度。现在把检查结果报告给你们：
    一、我们参加工作都已经有十二三年了，但还没有真正树立为人民服务的思想，因此常常摆“老资格”，在行动上表现骄傲自满，作风不民主，态度不老实。如工会干部对生产提出合理的建议时，我们不是用虚心的态度来接受，心里总认为：你们工会干部算什么？！往往对工人或工会干部的意见置之不理。
    二、由于我们存在的官僚主义作风，所以不会也不愿意发动工人参加工厂的管理工作，而错误地认为供销社搞生产是对工人的“恩赐”与“救济”。这当然也就谈不到关心工人的福利事业了。阻挠工会干部去职工训练班学习的事情确实是有的，现在我们认识到这是侵犯工人的政治权利，是原则性的错误。
    三、由于我们一贯不大学习，成天在事务工作上打圈子，对工厂的管理工作就根本不懂。对关于管理工厂的文件，政府颁布的工会法等法令政策，就没有学习过。总的说来，我们在领导工作上存在资本家对待工人的不正确的作风和态度。
    以上是我们的检讨，望编辑同志予以发表，如认为不够深刻的地方，希指出再次检讨。
            大名县供销社草帽辫工厂经理  陈秀祥、边书田
