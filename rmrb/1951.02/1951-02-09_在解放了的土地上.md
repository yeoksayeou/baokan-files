　　On Liberated Land
　　·Ding Fan·

　　The sun had just peeked over the eastern mountains, and the pale morning mist still lingered on the mountaintops. The small pine trees on the western hillside looked especially green in the morning sun, and the yellow oaks beside the valley shone with a golden light. The white snow on the rice paddies, the ice shavings by the streams... and the slate-like blue flagstones embedded in the low wooden houses, all glittered brightly. We were captivated by this beautiful and peaceful scene, breathing freely and comfortably in this newly liberated land. If it weren't for the war, it would feel like traveling to a beautiful paradise.

　　Village Chairman Li Hexian and I, along with an interpreter, Old Liu, walked along the winding stream at the foot of the mountain towards Michengdong. This small village of twelve households nestled at the foot of the northern mountains had just been abandoned by the enemy. Li Hexian had only returned yesterday from Manpo, and today he had already begun working.

　　Finding houses, finding people, delivering letters, borrowing grain...

　　We came to this newly liberated place, unfamiliar with the geography and unable to understand the language, so there were many difficulties. But Li Hexian spared no effort to run errands for us, helping us find warm floors, assigning people to cook and fetch water... We really didn't know how to thank him.

　　On the way, I asked him about his return.

　　He had retreated to Manpo with the People's Army two months earlier, along with several young lads. They fought like soldiers and did odd jobs... Until the counter-offensive, he returned victoriously to his hometown with the People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers. But his home had been destroyed by the American devils and the Li Seung-man bandit army. The house had no roof, and the yard was piled with charred pieces of clothing and burnt planks. He frowned, his eyes flashing with hatred, and after looking at the home he had built with his own hands, he sighed and quietly walked away.

　　I followed beside him, not knowing how to comfort him. In truth, we were not outsiders. In the just war against our common enemy—American imperialism and its running dog Li Seung-man—we had become brothers.

　　"I had expected this long ago. As long as I have two hands left, we can rebuild it in the future..." He waved his strong arms at me and said.

　　This Korean people's warrior, tempered in the war, reminded me of the victorious and liberated Korean people, who would build many beautiful buildings and factories on their own land, from his prominent cheekbones and twitching facial muscles…

　　He went to the nearby villages in turn every day, actively gathering Labor Party members and the masses to discuss how to restore the political power and support the front lines. In a short period of time, they did a lot of work, such as comforting the families of victims, raising grain locally to support the front lines, writing slogans to celebrate the victory, and setting up signposts... They also decided to send villagers to the highway to set up a temporary traffic station to receive passing troops. Labor Party member Zheng Shunjiu was the first to volunteer.

　　One evening, before it was dark, he took me to a large cave to check the air-raid shelter. At that time, the people hiding inside still didn't know that the American devils had been driven away by us. When we bent down and entered the cave, in the light of the pine torches, dozens of women, children, and old people looked at us with surprise. Old Li and the interpreter, Old Liu, explained to them:

　　"We are the Chinese People's Volunteers, here to help you fight the American devils and liberate you..."

　　Old Liu explained kindly in Korean, afraid they wouldn't understand, and Old Li also chattered for a long time.

　　Only then did they restrain their surprised looks and gradually gather around us.

　　"Is it okay to go out now?..." An old woman asked the interpreter, Old Liu, with great concern. From her anxious face, one could see how cruelly and inhumanely the enemy had ravaged them!

　　"Don't worry! Grandma, the American devils have been driven away by us..."

　　She breathed a long sigh of relief, as if exhaling many days of torment and disaster, and said, "Thank God, it's finally good!"

　　She bowed repeatedly to thank us. A joyful smile had appeared on her gray face.

　　Almost all the houses in the village were burned down. The grain buried underground had also been robbed or burned by the enemy. Before fleeing, the American and Li bandits threatened and deceived them, saying: "You must follow us quickly, otherwise, when the Chinese come, they will kill you all. When you get to South Korea, you will eat rice and wear leather shoes..."

　　Although the simple and kind Korean people had been subjected to all kinds of temptations and threats from the enemy, they had long recognized who was the enemy and who was the friend.

　　Now, they dug out the grain buried under the stones, cooked it into rice, and treated us as warmly as if we were their children returning from a long journey.

　　The village has changed. It has become so new, so happy, and so full of vitality. Adults and children are as happy as if they are celebrating a festival. The people in the cave have all returned to participate in various support-the-front activities and are preparing for next year's production. Cui Shengshi's family has already begun to turn over their own compost, and the women are also tidying up their looms and cotton, and using wooden sticks to make cotton rolls one by one; the whirring of spinning wheels can be heard everywhere on the street.

　　After dinner, this is the most active time for the whole village. Children run around the streets, some go to the mountains to drag branches, and some sit on small wooden carts and play ice skating. Little Jin Yupei sang "Arirang" (a Korean folk song) in front of the door again, and the girls also danced Korean folk dances with the children and sang "Ode to General Kim Il-sung." The singing vibrated through the valley and echoed in the newly liberated village of Michengdong.

　　When our Comrade × showed him (her) the Korean rice pounding dance and laundry dance that the Chinese Yanbian Cultural Troupe had performed in Beijing, he (her) was extremely happy. The old people grinned and laughed, the young people applauded enthusiastically, and the little dolls playfully took the rice pounding sticks and stuffed them into Comrade ×'s hands, earnestly asking him: "Again, one more time..."

　　These peaceful and hardworking Korean people love their labor and the art of expressing these laboring lives so dearly, and they are also fighting to the end for these happy lives.

　　The moon climbed over the top of the mountain, shining brightly on the few slogans written in Chinese on the west wall -

　　"Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!"

　　"Long live the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!"

　　……………

　　This symbolizes that the people of China and Korea are uniting more closely, more intimately, and more powerfully in the common war against American imperialist aggression.

　　On this newly liberated land, everything is full of new atmosphere. Victory songs are echoing everywhere. Beside the distant rice paddies, Korean soldiers are singing "The People's Army March." The industrious and brave Korean people will use their own hands to rebuild their homeland that has been trampled by the enemy, and use their own sweat to wash away the land that has been stained by beasts; at the same time, they must use combat guns to resolutely defend their beautiful home and fertile rice paddies.

### 在解放了的土地上

　　在解放了的土地上
    ·丁帆·
    太阳刚从东山上钻出来，灰白色的晨雾还隐约地留在山顶。西山坡上的小松树，迎着朝阳显得格外翠绿，峡谷旁的黄柞也透射出金黄色的光辉。稻田上的白雪、溪水边的冰屑……还有嵌在矮木房上像鳞片似的青石板，都闪耀着亮晶晶的光芒。我们神往着这美丽和平的景象，舒畅自由地呼吸在这新解放了的土地上，如果不是在战时，简直像旅行到一所幽美的乐园。
    里委员长（即村长）李鹤仙和我，还有一个翻译老刘，一共三个人，顺着山角下弯弯的溪水走向米城洞去。这个靠着北山根住有十二户人家的小村子，敌人刚刚逃走，李鹤仙是昨天才由满浦赶回来，而今天他已经开始工作。
    找房子、找人、送信、借粮……
    我们来到这新解放的地方，地理不熟，语言也不懂，困难是很多的。但李鹤仙却毫不辞劳苦为我们奔走，帮我们找了暖炕，分配人做饭烧水……我们真不知道怎样去感谢他。
    在路上的时候，我曾问他回来的情形。
    他是在两个月以前随着人民军撤退到满浦的，同行的还有好几个青年小伙子。他们一面像军队一样去战斗，一面做些零碎事务工作。…直到反攻，他又随着人民军与我国人民志愿部队胜利地回到故乡。但是家已经被美国鬼子与李承晚匪军毁坏得破烂不堪了。房子没有了屋顶，院子里堆满了烧剩下的破衣片和焦木板。他紧皱着眉头，眼睛里露出仇恨的火焰，看着这所曾经由自己亲手建筑起来的家，叹了口气便轻轻地走开了。
    我跟在他身旁，不知怎样来安慰他才好。说真的，我们不是外人，在反对我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的正义战争中，我们已经变成了亲兄弟。
    “这是我早就预料到的。只要留下两只手，等将来我们再盖好的……”在我面前，他挥动着粗壮的胳膊向我说。
    这个在战争中锻炼出来的朝鲜人民战士，从他那突出的颧骨和脸上抽动着的筋肉，我仿佛看见了胜利解放了的朝鲜人民，将要从自己的土地上建造起许多美丽的楼房和工厂……
    他每天轮流地去附近的几个村子，积极召集劳动党员和群众，商量如何恢复政权工作和支援前线。在很短时间里，他们做了许多工作，如慰问受难家属，就地筹粮支援前线，写标语庆祝胜利，埋设指路牌……并决定村里人到公路上去，设一临时交通站，招待来往军队。劳动党员郑顺久首先报名参加。
    一天晚上，天还没有黑，他带我到一个大山洞里去察看防空的地方。当时在那里面躲避的人们还不知道美国鬼子兵已被我们打跑了。当我们弯着腰走进山洞时，在点着松明的亮光里，几十个妇女、小孩、老人用惊奇的眼光看着我们。老李和翻译老刘向他们解释说：
    “我们是中国人民志愿军，是来帮助你们打美国鬼子和解放你们的……”
    老刘用朝鲜话亲切地解说着，深怕他们听不懂，而老李也嘀哩嘟噜讲了半天。
    他（她）们才收敛起惊异的眼光，渐渐向我们围拢来。
    “这会儿出去不要紧吗？……”一个老太婆很担心地问翻译老刘。从她那付焦愁的脸上，可以看到敌人对她们的蹂躏是多么的残酷和没人性！
    “放心吧！老大娘，美国鬼子都叫咱们打跑了……。”
    她长长吁了一口气，好像吐出许多天以来的折磨和灾难似的，她说：“老天爷，这回总算好啦！”
    她连连弯着身子向我们致谢。在她那灰暗的脸上已经露出了欢喜的笑容。
    村里的房子差不多都烧光了。埋在地下的粮食也都被敌人抢走或烧掉了。美、李匪军在逃跑以前，还在威胁欺骗她们说：“你们赶快随我们走，要不，等中国人来了都会把你们杀光。到了南朝鲜给你们吃大米，穿皮鞋……”
    纯朴善良的朝鲜人民，虽然受了敌人的百般引诱和威胁，可是他（她）们，早就认清了谁是敌人谁是朋友。
    如今，他（她）们把埋在石头下面的粮食掘出来煮成饭，像照护自己由远路回来的孩子一样，亲热地招待我们吃。
    村里变样了。变得那么新、那么愉快、那么有生气。大人小孩都像办喜事一样地高兴，山洞里的人们也都回来参加各种支前工作，并准备来年生产。崔胜石家里已经开始翻弄自己的土粪，女人们也在整理织布机和棉花，并用木棒槎成一篓一篓棉卷儿；街上到处都可以听到吱吱的纺线声。
    晚饭后，这是全村人最活动的时候，孩子们满街飞跑，有的到山上去拖树枝，有的坐在小木车上在溜冰玩。金玉佩小娃娃又在门前唱起了“阿里郎”（朝鲜民歌），少女们也和孩子在一起跳着朝鲜土风舞，唱着“金日成将军颂”的歌子，歌声震荡着山谷，也响澈了新解放的小村庄——米城洞。
    当我们的×同志，模仿中国延边文工团曾在北京演出过的朝鲜舂米舞与洗衣舞给他（她）们看的时候，他（她）们简直是喜欢极了。老人们咧着嘴大笑，青年们热烈地鼓掌，小娃娃们顽皮地拿着捣米木棒，直往×同志手里塞，恳切地要求他：“再来一次，再来一次……”
    这些和平勤劳的朝鲜人民，他（她）们是那样挚爱自己的劳动和表现这些劳动生活的艺术，他们也正为着这些幸福生活斗争到底。
    月亮从山顶上爬过来，很显明地照在西墙上面贴着的几条用中国字写成的标语——
    “中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”
    “中国人民与朝鲜人民的深厚友谊万岁！”
    ……………
    这象征着中朝两国人民，在共同反对美帝国主义侵略战争中团结的更紧、更亲密，更有力量。
    在这新解放的土地上，一切都充满着新的气象。遍地响起胜利的歌声。在远远的稻田旁，朝鲜战士们在唱着“人民军进行曲”。勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民，将要用自己的手来修建曾经被敌人践踏过的故乡，用自己的汗来洗清曾经被野兽沾污过的土地；同时，更要用战斗的枪枝，坚决保卫着自己的美好家园和丰饶的稻田。
