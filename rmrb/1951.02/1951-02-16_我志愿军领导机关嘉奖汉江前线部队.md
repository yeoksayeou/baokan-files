Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th: The leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently issued a circular to commend units that achieved brilliant results in the heroic battles on the Han River front. During the powerful counter-offensive launched by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the evening of the 11th, two units of the Volunteer Army, southwest of Hongcheon and east of Yongdu-ri, courageously and decisively destroyed enemy positions in the two locations. They then rapidly advanced more than 30 kilometers, directly inserting themselves into the area northwest and north of Hoengseong, and captured Bicheoksan, Gwangdae, Daenam, Buksan, and other places, cutting off the escape route of the American invading army and the puppet Rhee army north of Hoengseong. According to preliminary statistics, the two units have captured approximately 3,500 enemy soldiers in this operation. These two units have been commended for their achievements.

Also commended was a certain unit that recently tenaciously resisted the enemy north of Icheon, on the south bank of the Han River. This unit fought fiercely with the enemy for eighteen days and nights, repelling round after round of joint attacks by the enemy's land and air forces day and night, and constantly launching counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the 10th of this month, the U.S. invading army's 1st Cavalry Division, with two regiments, under the cover of 40 tanks, more than 30 aircraft, and intense artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on the unit's position in four directions. After a day of fierce fighting, the U.S. forces were defeated and forced to retreat in disarray, with more than 500 men killed or wounded by the Volunteer Army unit.

After defending a key position on the south bank of the Han River against intense enemy artillery fire for two days and nights, the 2nd Battalion and 8th Company of a certain unit temporarily withdrew from the position. That night, the battalion organized 26 warriors and launched a sudden and courageous counterattack against the enemy, driving an enemy battalion out of the position. They killed, wounded, or captured more than 30 enemy soldiers, and seized seven light and heavy machine guns, ten carbines, one rocket launcher, and five radios. These two units were also commended by the Volunteer Army leadership.

　　我志愿军领导机关嘉奖汉江前线部队
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关顷通报嘉奖在汉江前线英勇作战中获得辉煌战果的部队。在中朝人民军队在十一日晚发起的强大反攻中，志愿军某两部队在洪川西南及龙头里以东，勇猛果敢地摧毁了两地的敌人阵地，随即迅速推进三十多公里，直插到横城西北及以北地区，攻占了碧鹤山、广田、台南、北山等地，将横城以北的美国侵略军及李伪军的逃路截断。据初步统计，该两部队在这次作战中已俘掳敌军约三千五百名。该两部队已因而荣获表扬。
    获得表扬的部队，还有最近在汉江南岸利川以北顽强抗击敌军的某部。该部与敌军激战十八昼夜，击退敌陆、空军不分昼夜的轮番联合猛扑，并不断举行反击，予敌重大杀伤。本月十日，美国侵略军骑兵第一师曾以两个团的兵力，在四十辆坦克、三十多架飞机和猛烈炮火的掩护下，分四路向该部阵地猛攻，经终日激战，被我该部志愿军毙伤五百多人，终于狼狈溃退。
    某部第二营和第八连，冒敌人猛烈炮火，坚守汉江南岸某主要阵地两昼夜后，暂时撤离阵地；当晚，该营组织二十六名勇士，突然向敌勇猛反击，将敌一个营逐出阵地，计毙伤俘敌三十多名，并缴获轻重机枪七挺，卡宾枪十枝，火箭筒一个，报话机五部，这两个部队也受到了志愿军领导机关的表扬。
