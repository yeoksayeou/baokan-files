Xinhua News Agency, 13th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article on the 11th discussing how the United States is turning Japan into its war appendage. The author of the article, Nikolsky, stated: In their manic plan to dominate the world, the US imperialists have designated Japan as their military base and a supplier of cannon fodder. After launching aggression against Korea and China, they are openly engaged in rebuilding Japan's war machine. Most important to the US imperialists is Japan's cannon fodder – soldiers. Since the US invasion of Korea, the establishment of a regular Japanese army has been proceeding with particular speed. MacArthur ordered Japan to establish a "Police Reserve Force" of 75,000 men. In order to build a huge Japanese army, MacArthur's headquarters later suggested tripling the number of the "Police Reserve Force". Fifty military training centers have been established throughout Japan to train large numbers of personnel for this force.

The author pointed out that MacArthur is trying to insert former regular Japanese soldiers into the current Japanese army, especially in command positions. It is precisely for this purpose that he has opened prison doors wide and illegally released a large number of key war criminals.

MacArthur is using Japanese troops to fight against the Korean people. The United States has already recruited old, unrepentant Japanese Bushido elements to fight in Korea under the command of Japanese and American officers.

However, the US imperialists' attempt to rebuild the Japanese invading army and drag Japan completely into military adventures has met with resolute opposition from the Japanese people.

The Japanese people do not want to repeat the national catastrophe they once suffered due to the will of the Japanese militarists. Therefore, they are opposing the transformation of Japan into a war accomplice of the US imperialists with increasing energy.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 13th dispatch: "Voice of Vietnam" published a commentary condemning the US imperialists' ongoing conspiracy to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan as "a shameless violation of the international agreements that stipulated the democratization of Japan and the convening of a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom to draft a peace treaty with Japan."

The commentary pointed out that this conspiracy of the reactionary elements in the United States "is a direct threat to all peace-loving people – especially the people of the Soviet Union, China, and Southeast Asian countries." The commentary emphasized that the people of the Far East, who have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression, will forever remember the terrible crimes committed by the Japanese bandits. They cannot ignore the serious danger posed by the existence of a rearmed and remilitarized Japan under the control of the gold-dollar imperialists. The Vietnamese people, who will never forget the suffering under Japanese occupation, fully understand this threat, especially because the aggressive camp is planning to send Japanese soldiers to Vietnam to fight against the Vietnamese people in order to prolong the days of French colonialism.

The commentary continued: The Japanese people will also not ignore that in the terrible massacre that Wall Street wants and is already preparing for, the reactionary Yoshida government and its American masters have prepared them to be cannon fodder. The Japanese people are fighting with all their strength against the US monopolists who are enslaving their country and against the treacherous actions of their reactionary leaders. The wave of persecution launched by the Yoshida government against progressive elements proves that the imperialists have seen the Japanese people's movement as a force to be reckoned with.

### 共青真理报、越南之声发表评论  反对美帝武装日本

　　共青真理报、越南之声发表评论
　  反对美帝武装日本
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：共青真理报十一日在一篇文章中，讨论美国如何在把日本变成它的战争附庸。该文作者尼科拉斯基称：美帝国主义者在他们独霸世界的神经错乱的计划中，指定日本充当他们的军事基地和炮灰的供给者。他们在对朝鲜和中国发动了侵略之后，就公开地从事重建日本战争机器。对美国帝国主义者最重要的是日本的炮灰——兵士。自美国侵略朝鲜后，成立日本正规军就在特别加速地进行，麦克阿瑟命令日本成立一支七万五千人的“警察后备队”。为了建立庞大的日本陆军，麦克阿瑟总部后来又建议把“警察后备队”的人数增加到三倍。日本全国已设立了五十个军事训练中心来训练该队的大批人员。
    作者指出：麦克阿瑟正企图把从前的日本正规军人安插到现在的日本军队里，特别是安置在指挥的位置上。恰恰是为了这个目的，他大开牢门，非法释放了大批首要战犯。
    麦克阿瑟正利用日军对朝鲜人民作战，美国业已征召了旧创未愈的日本武士道分子，在日本与美国军官的指挥下在朝鲜作战。
    然而，美帝国主义者重建日本侵略军并企图把日本完全拖进军事冒险的作法，碰到了日本人民的坚决反对。
    日本人民不愿重演他们一度因日本黩武军国主义者的意志而遭受的国家浩劫，因此，他们正在以日益增长的精力反对把日本变成美帝国主义者的战争帮凶。
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社北越十三日讯：越南之声发表评论，谴责美帝国主义者正在进行的与日本签订单独和约和重新武装日本的阴谋活动，是“无耻地违犯了规定日本民主化并召开苏、中、美、英四强会议草拟对日和约的国际协定”。
    评论指出：美国反动分子的这一阴谋活动，“是对一切爱好和平的人民——首先是对苏联、中国和东南亚各国的人民——的直接威胁。”评论强调宣称：远东的人民曾经身受日本帝国主义的侵略，并将永远记住日本强盗所犯的恐怖罪行，他们不能漠视在金元帝国主义操纵下重新武装和重新军国主义化的日本的存在所构成的严重危险。永远不会忘记在日本占领下所受的痛苦的越南人民完全晓得这种威胁，特别是因为侵略阵营正在计划派遣日本军人去越南与越南人民作战，以延长法国殖民主义的日子。
    评论继称：日本人民也不会漠视：在华尔街所要的并已在准备中的恐怖大屠杀中，反动的吉田政府和它的美国主子们预备好了让他们去充当炮灰。日本人民正在以全力进行斗争，反对美国垄断资本家奴役他们的国家并反对他们的反动领袖们的卖国行为。吉田政府对进步分子发动的迫害浪潮证明：帝国主义者已经看到了日本人民运动是一支不可忽视的力量。
