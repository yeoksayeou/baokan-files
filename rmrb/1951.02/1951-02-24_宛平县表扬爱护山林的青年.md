　　Wanping County Commends Young People Who Love and Protect the Forests
    Comrade Editor:
    There is a fine forest on Songyu Mountain near Datai Village in the Third District of Wanping County, Hebei Province. On the evening of February 1st, a fire suddenly broke out in the forest, and the raging flames illuminated the entire mountain. Sun Yuqing, a member of the Youth League branch in Datai Village, was the first to discover it. He thought, although these trees are privately owned, they are all the assets of our motherland. Therefore, while reporting to the local People's Government, he mobilized 26 young people from the village to put out the fire, and finally extinguished the blaze.
    On February 7th, a fire broke out again in the Xiaolingdao Mountain forest near Qingshuijian Village in Wanping County. Li Wenkuan, a young farmer from the village, discovered the fire and immediately mobilized thirteen young people, including An Shiyuan, to go up the mountain to put it out. As a result, the fire, which was fanned by the wind, was also extinguished by them.
    Now, the Wanping County People's Government, in addition to investigating the cause of these two fires, has commended these young people who are enthusiastically protecting the forests of the motherland.

　　宛平县表扬爱护山林的青年
    编辑同志：
    河北省宛平县三区大台村附近的松玉山上，有一片很好的树林。二月一日晚，忽然山林着火，熊熊的火光，把一片大山照得通红。大台村的青年团支部委员孙玉清首先发现了，他想，这些树木虽然属于私人所有，但是，这全是我们祖国的资财。因此，他一面报告当地人民政府，一面就动员了全村二十六个青年去施救，终于把这次大火扑灭了。
    二月七日，宛平县清水涧村附近的小岭道山林又起了大火。该村青年农民李文宽发现后，立刻发动了安士元等十三个青年上山施救，结果，顺风席卷的大火，也被他们扑灭了。
    现在宛平县人民政府，除了追查这两次起火原因外，并表扬了这些热心爱护祖国山林的青年。
