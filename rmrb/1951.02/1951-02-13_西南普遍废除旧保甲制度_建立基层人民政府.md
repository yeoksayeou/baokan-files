Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th—The rural areas of the Southwest Region have universally abolished the old Baojia system and established district and township people's political power organs, further consolidating the basic-level people's democratic dictatorship. With the exception of a few marginal areas, the two administrative regions of northern Sichuan and western Sichuan have established district and township political power. In Yunnan Province, more than 160 districts and more than 6,800 villages in the Pu'er and Lijiang Special Zones have established people's democratic political power. In Guizhou Province, 3,000 villages have established people's governments. In Danzhai County, Guizhou Province, an area with a mixed ethnic population, five townships and forty-two villages have established political power, and half of the villages elected Miao compatriots as village chiefs. The rural political power organizations in the eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and western Kang provinces are also being universally established. The establishment of rural political power organizations in various places is based on the fact that the political consciousness of farmers has been raised in the process of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent, and they have demanded the abolition of the old Baojia system. Farmers in northern Sichuan put forward the slogan "The people do the people's affairs, establish a new rural political power." According to the requirements of the farmers, the county and district people's governments in various places explicitly abolished the old Baojia system, convened meetings of farmer representatives, and carefully elected the township chiefs, village chiefs, and committee members that they loved. The farmers of Huayuan Village, Ba County, eastern Sichuan, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao saying: "We have elected the people we love, and they will lead us to build a beautiful Huayuan Village."

The establishment of rural political power organs has further consolidated the basic-level people's democratic dictatorship and enabled various tasks to be carried out smoothly. Under the leadership of the newly elected township people's government, the farmers of Maojia Township in Anyue County, northern Sichuan, completed the task of transporting 150,000 jin of public grain to Tongnan County within two days. The farmers of Luojiatun in Bijie County, Guizhou Province, actively reported the black land concealed by the landlords, which enabled the village to overfulfill its public grain task last autumn and send the grain to the warehouse within two days; in the suppression of bandits, they also seized seven long and short guns, and won the honorary title of "Model Village for Suppressing Bandits and Collecting Grain."

Most of the cadres working in rural political power are activists elected by the masses, and because they come from the masses, they have closer ties between the government and the people. After Yang Bochang, a Miao compatriot from Nibaxiang Township, Anshun County, Guizhou Province, was elected as the township chief, the Miao people in the area believed that this was an unprecedented honor for the Miao people and expressed their firm support for their government. Long Laotaipo from Shiyancun Village, Wanxian County, eastern Sichuan, said: "In the past, we were worried and scared when the Bao chief came to our door, but now we welcome the village chief with joy." Her words summarized the new relationship between the government and the people.

　　西南普遍废除旧保甲制度
　  建立基层人民政府
    【新华社重庆十一日电】西南区各地农村已普遍废除旧保甲制度，建立了区、乡人民政权机关，进一步巩固了基层人民民主专政。川北、川西两个行政区除少数边缘地区外，均已建立了区、乡政权。云南省普洱、丽江两专区已有一百六十多个区和六千八百多个村建立了人民民主政权。贵州省已有三千个村成立了人民政府。该省丹寨县民族杂居地区已建立了五个乡和四十二村的政权，其中有半数的村庄选举苗族同胞为村长。川东、川南两行政区和西康省的农村政权机构也在普遍建立中。各地农村政权组织，是在清剿土匪、反对恶霸和减租运动中农民政治觉悟提高、纷纷要求废除旧保甲制度的基础上建立的。川北区农民就提出了“人民的事人民干，建立乡村新政权”的口号。各地县、区人民政府根据农民的要求，明令废除了旧保甲制度，并召开农民代表会议，由农民慎重推选了自己爱戴的乡长、村长和委员。川东区巴县花园村的农民写信告诉毛主席说：“我们已选出自己爱戴的人了，他将领导我们建设美好的花园村。”
    农村政权机构的建立，进一步巩固了基层人民民主专政，使各项工作顺利展开。川北区安岳县毛家乡农民在新选的乡人民政府领导下，两天内便完成了运输公粮十五万斤到潼南县的任务。贵州毕节县罗家屯农民积极检举地主隐瞒的黑地，使该屯去年秋季公粮任务超额完成，并在两天内送粮入库；在清剿土匪中又缴获长短枪七枝，获得了“剿匪征粮模范村”的光荣称号。
    农村政权工作干部多数是群众推选出来的积极分子，由于他们从群众中来，更密切了政府与人民的联系。贵州安顺县泥坝乡苗族同胞杨伯昌当选为乡长后，该地苗族人民认为这是苗族从未有过的光荣，纷纷表示要坚决拥护自己的政府。川东区万县石堰村龙老太婆说：“过去保长一登门便提心吊胆，现在村长来了，我们欢欢喜喜迎接。”她的话概括了政府与人民间的新的关系。
