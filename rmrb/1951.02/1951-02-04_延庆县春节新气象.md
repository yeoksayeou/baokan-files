To the Editor:

The 130,000 people of Yanqing County, Chahar Province, are now joyously preparing to welcome the Spring Festival of 1951. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, Yanqing County's production in 1950 has recovered to pre-war levels. People whose lives are gradually improving are preparing to celebrate their production achievements during the Spring Festival and to promote resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country. Currently, the county's drama troupes, Yangko teams, and both new and old artists are rehearsing. Elementary schools have already started their winter vacation, and the students' Yangko teams have gone to the countryside to spread the word.

The happier people are, the more they remember their leader, Chairman Mao. Zhang Ran, a provincial model worker representative, was a superstitious person in the old society. Every Spring Festival, he couldn't afford anything, but he had to buy a "Kitchen God." This year, he will not buy a "Kitchen God." This Spring Festival, Zhang Ran bought a finely printed portrait of Chairman Mao and even had it framed with glass. He told his neighbors: Chairman Mao brought me land and houses; with land and houses, I have a good life.

Many villagers no longer buy old almanacs, but instead buy calendars printed with Chairman Mao's image. The peasants hope to see Chairman Mao's image every day.

The business of selling Spring Festival couplets is also very good now. The couplets most loved by workers and peasants are "The Communist Party is the great savior, Chairman Mao is the great benefactor" and "Resist America, aid Korea, defend the country, increase production and labor to get rich," etc.

With Chairman Mao, there are joyful festivals. When the holidays arrive, people especially remember their beloved Chairman Mao.

    延庆县春节新气象编辑同志：
    察哈尔省延庆县的十三万人民，现在正欢天喜地准备迎接一九五一年的春节。在毛主席的英明领导之下，延庆县一九五零年的生产已恢复到战前的水平。生活逐渐上升起来的人们，他们准备在春节时庆祝自己的生产成就并宣传抗美援朝保家卫国。现在全县的剧团、秧歌队，新旧艺人们都在进行着排演，小学已经放寒假了，学生们的秧歌队，已经下乡宣传去了。
    人们越是快乐，就越是忘不了自己的领袖毛主席。全省的劳动模范代表张然，在旧社会他是一个迷信的人，每到过春节时，什么都买不起，但是“灶老爷”是不能不买的。今年他不再买“灶老爷”了。今年过春节，张然买了一张精印的毛主席像，并且还配了一个玻璃框子。他告诉邻人说：毛主席带给我土地和房子；有了土地和房子，就有了好日子。
    不少乡村的农民，都不再买旧的宪书，而买了印有毛主席像的日历。农民们希望天天能够看见毛主席的像。
    现在买卖春联的生意也很好，工人、农民最喜爱的春联是“共产党大救星，毛主席大恩人”，“抗美援朝保家卫国，增加生产劳动致富”等。
    有了毛主席，就有了愉快的节日，一到节日，人们就分外地想起亲爱的毛主席。
