Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Chinese working class, inheriting the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" struggle against imperialism, is playing a great role in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country. Workers have made brilliant contributions to rapidly strengthening the country's economic power. When U.S. imperialism extended the flames of its war of aggression against Korea to our country's doorstep, when U.S. planes constantly bombed and strafed our northeastern territory, and when the United States occupied our Taiwan, workers across the country were extremely indignant, expressing their determination to "regard the factory as the battlefield," producing one more finished product to increase the strength to strike against U.S. imperialism. Zhao Guoyou, a well-known national model worker, and his team in the lathe department issued a challenge letter to workers in Northeast China on October 25th of last year to launch a patriotic production emulation campaign. A patriotic production emulation campaign quickly unfolded first in the Northeast, the front line of national defense. After the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a declaration on November 6th, calling on the working class across the country to launch a movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, this patriotic production emulation campaign, along with the current affairs study movement, spread like wildfire across the country. By the beginning of January, according to incomplete statistics from the four regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South, more than 1,200 industrial and mining enterprises and more than 1.2 million workers had joined this movement. Among them, railway and electricity workers accounted for more than 70 percent of their total number. By January of this year, the patriotic production emulation campaign in East China and Central South had expanded from large cities to medium and small cities, from state-owned enterprises to private enterprises, and from large-scale industries to small handicrafts. In the patriotic production emulation campaign, workers and staff fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for labor and creation, improved production tools, improved operating methods, and improved labor organization, thereby greatly increasing production efficiency. For example, Jiang Wanshou, chief of the engineering section of the Northeast No. 1 Clothing Factory, reasonably improved labor organization, which increased the factory's output by 62 percent in December of last year, enabling the increased production tasks to be completed on schedule. Another example is Zhang Huaiyu and Zhang Naiyu, foundry workers at the Jinan Railway Factory, who improved production tools, increasing output tenfold compared to before the start of the emulation campaign. When the Northeast state-owned industry ended the third quarter of last year, one-third of the annual task had not been completed, but after the patriotic production emulation campaign was launched in the fourth quarter, the total value of production exceeded the original plan by 1.8 percent. Workers in state-owned and private cotton textile factories across the country overfulfilled the task of increasing production by 20 yarn counts in the emulation campaign, with state-owned cotton textile factories overfulfilling it by 116 percent.

In mid-January, with the challenge issued by the Ma Hengchang group to workers across the country, the patriotic production emulation campaign gained new development. As of February 6th, 604 units in various regions had responded to the challenge. The development of this production team emulation movement has deepened the production emulation.

Chinese workers have not only demonstrated great strength in building a strong economic power but also demonstrated heroic spirit in building a strong national defense force. A large number of outstanding young workers have responded to the call of the motherland and signed up to join military cadre schools. In Beijing, more than 1,000 young workers signed up in three days, and in Shanghai, more than 8,000 signed up in four days. Young workers in major cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Qingdao also signed up very enthusiastically. They expressed their determination to master modern combat technology so that our country, in addition to the army, will also become a world-class power in the air force, navy, and other special forces. The workers who remained at their production posts also expressed their determination to replace the work of these soldiers and make the patriotic production emulation campaign even better.

In order to help the Korean people and comfort the Chinese and Korean People's troops, in addition to the 500 million yuan allocated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the Korean Professional League, workers in various regions donated huge amounts of condolence money despite still living an arduous life. For example, railway workers donated, according to incomplete statistics, more than 16 million yuan by December 16th of last year; textile workers donated 1.28 million yuan by November 3rd of last year. Medical workers in various regions formed volunteer surgical teams and medical teams to aid Korea and work on the Korean front. According to statistics, a total of six teams with more than 900 people were formed in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, Central South, and other places.

### 工人阶级走在抗美援朝的前列

　　工人阶级走在抗美援朝的前列
    【新华社六日讯】中国工人阶级继承“二七”反对帝国主义斗争的光荣传统，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中发挥着伟大的作用。工人们为了迅速加强祖国的经济力量已作了辉煌的贡献。当美帝国主义把侵略朝鲜的战火延烧到我国大门，美机不断地轰炸扫射我东北领土，美国侵占我国台湾的时候，全国工人愤激万分，纷纷表示“将工厂作为战场”，多生产一件成品，多增加一份打击美帝国主义的力量。著名全国劳动模范赵国有所在的车工部在去年十月二十五日向东北工人发出了开展爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战书。一个爱国主义生产竞赛就首先在国防前线的东北地区迅速开展起来。到十一月六日，全国总工会发表宣言，号召全国工人阶级开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动之后，这一爱国主义生产竞赛运动就随着时事学习运动，如火如荼地普及全国。到一月初，据东北、华北、华东、中南四个地区的不完全统计，已有一千二百多个工矿企业单位，一百二十多万工人投入这一运动。其中铁路、电业工人则占其总数的百分之七十以上。到今年一月，华东和中南区的爱国主义生产竞赛已由大城市扩展到中小城市，由公营企业扩展到私营企业，由大工业扩展到小手工业。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，工人职员们充分发挥劳动创造的热情，改良生产工具，改进操作方法，改善劳动组织，因而使生产效率大为提高。例如东北被服一厂工务科科长姜万寿合理地改进劳动组织，使去年十二月份该厂产量提高百分之六十二，使增加的生产任务按期完成。又如济南铁路工厂铸工张怀玉和张乃玉改良生产工具，使产量比开展竞赛前提高了十倍。东北国营工业在去年第三季结束时，全年任务还差三分之一没有完成，但经过第四季中开展了爱国主义生产竞赛，生产总值竟超过百分之一点八完成原计划。全国公私营棉纺织厂工人，在竞赛中超额完成增产二十支纱的任务，其中国营棉纺厂竟超额百分之一百一十六。
    一月中旬，随着马恒昌小组向全国工人的挑战，爱国主义生产竞赛又获得了新的发展。到二月六日为止，各地应战的单位已达六百零四个。这一生产小组竞赛运动的开展，使生产竞赛更加深入。
    中国工人不仅在建设强大经济力量上表现了伟大力量，而且在建设强大国防力量上表现了英雄的气概。大批优秀的青年工人已响应祖国的召唤，报名参加了军事干部学校。报名的青年工人，在北京市，三天中就有一千多名，在上海市，四天中就有八千多名。沈阳、天津、武汉、青岛等各大城市青年工人报名都非常踊跃。他们表示决心掌握现代化作战技术，使我国除陆军以外，还要在空军、海军及其他特种兵方面成为世界上的头等强国。留在生产岗位上的工人们也表示决心代替这些参军的工人的工作，把爱国主义生产竞赛搞得更好。
    为了帮助朝鲜人民和慰劳中朝人民部队，除中华全国总工会拨出五亿元交朝鲜职业总同盟外，各地工人尽管自己仍过着刻苦的生活，但仍捐献了巨额的慰问金。例如：铁路工人捐献的，据不完全统计，到去年十二月十六日止，有一千六百多万元；纺织工人捐献的，到去年十一月三日止，有一百二十八万元。各地医务工作者则曾组成抗美援朝志愿手术队和医疗队到朝鲜战地工作。据统计，北京、天津、沈阳、南京、中南等地共组成六个队，九百多人。
