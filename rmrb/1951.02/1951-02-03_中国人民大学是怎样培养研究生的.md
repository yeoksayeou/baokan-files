How Renmin University of China Trains Graduate Students
    Zhang Tengxiao Zhou Ming

    In order to cultivate a large number of teachers and experts in a planned and step-by-step manner, Renmin University of China transferred 220 cadres and students with high political and cultural levels from the university last year, and absorbed more than 100 progressive professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from universities and colleges across the country as graduate students. Under the leadership of each teaching and research office, they conduct independent research work according to the plan. At present, there are 41 research offices in the school, and after half a year of efforts, a lot of experience has been gained.

    The study period for graduate students is tentatively set at two years based on current needs. Due to special reasons, the study period for some off-campus researchers is shortened to one year, and they will return to work in universities and colleges across the country after the study period expires.

    Many of the graduate students of Renmin University have received higher education, and some have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles. Therefore, the main purpose of educating them is to further improve their political theory and master and be proficient in a certain scientific knowledge and skill. Therefore, the characteristics of the courses are relatively concentrated and refined. The compulsory courses in the first year are political economy, Marxism-Leninism, Russian, and a general theoretical subject related to the business; the second year is specialized business study, and the specific subjects vary according to the different businesses of each teaching and research office, generally two to four subjects. In order to truly cultivate professional talents, in addition to the compulsory business subjects, other elective subjects are not progressing at the same pace for each graduate student. Instead, the importance, quantity, and order of the courses are determined according to their major. This makes it possible to be proficient in one's own major and take care of all aspects of knowledge necessary for the major.

    Our two-year or one-year graduate courses differ in weight and depth, but the arrangements for political theory and professional courses are equally important. At the beginning of the study, a few graduate students only wanted to study specialized business and ignored the study of political theory, especially some researchers from outside the school, which was even more serious. They believe that it is possible to be proficient in business without a political and theoretical foundation. Facts have proved that this idea is completely wrong. They do not understand that the basic difference between new and old education is whether there is political theory and the concept of serving the people. They do not understand that without profound political and theoretical knowledge, it is impossible to truly master and be proficient in their own profession. Take law as an example, if you do not understand the correct relationship between law and political economy, it is impossible to correctly deal with legal issues. Take economics again, if you do not understand or have a systematic understanding of the principles of Marxist-Leninist political economy, it is also impossible to improve your professional level.

    The teaching process for graduate students is generally the same as that for students. Lectures, seminars, internships, experiments, visits, production internships, and tutoring are equally applicable to graduate students. However, in this teaching process, graduate students have improved a step compared to students. During the lectures, the main focus is on a thorough elaboration of the basic theories. Reference books are assigned, mainly the original works of Marxism-Leninism, for graduate students to conduct independent research. The research requires attention to systematicness, and uncentered and disorganized learning phenomena are not allowed. During seminars, students mainly conduct prepared and focused systematic discussions under the direct leadership of teachers. Although there are speaking outlines, there is no emphasis on concise and systematic written reports. Graduate students, however, are different. Before conducting discussions, they must have the above-mentioned written reports, which are checked by professors before being reported to everyone. After extensive and in-depth discussions and debates, the professor finally criticizes and draws conclusions. Regarding business matters, each semester must have its own independent research, and the research results and experiences are written into a paper. This paper, from content to writing, must undergo in-depth research by oneself. At the same time, each graduate student must give at least one special lecture on this business aspect at the meeting of the professional teaching and research office each semester. In the second academic year, scientific research work will be carried out, and there will be scientific research reports from graduate students at the annual scientific discussion meeting held by the school. Graduate students attach great importance to production internships. They not only go to enterprises and institutions for internships, but also conduct teaching internships, because they will all be scientific educators in the future. Production internships are to apply the scientific theories that have been learned to practice, so as to make their theories more solid, richer, and richer. From the entire learning process of graduate students, the main emphasis is on developing the spirit of independent research. Each graduate student has his own independent two-year study plan and research plan, including the study and scientific research work in their entire learning process. In addition to twelve to fifteen hours of lectures and seminars each week, the rest of the time is for independent research. However, their research work is not explored by themselves, but under the direct guidance of professors, with planned and organized research. All professors must guide the direction to be followed in their research work, and help solve the specific difficulties that occur in the research process.

    In the teaching process, we pay attention to guiding graduate students to pay attention to China's actual situation at any time (especially in seminar studies), so that we can combine theory with practice and enrich and consolidate the study of theory. In coordination with the study of theory, the graduate students of the law department of our department have visited the Beijing People's Court. At that time, the question of whether a criminal should be sentenced to death caused heated debates, which made our theory closer to reality and enriched our theory.

    According to this learning method, we have achieved great results this semester. The first is to increase confidence in learning. When the education plan was first announced, some people felt that the workload was heavy and worried about not being able to complete the learning tasks. However, after several months of study, especially after everyone made their own specific plans, their confidence was enhanced. Not only did they overcome the difficulties in studying the original works of Marx and Lenin, but they also gradually became interested. For example, when reading the first chapter of Capital, many people said they could not understand it, and even had a certain degree of fear of difficulties. However, thanks to the leadership's close attention and the Soviet professor's active and patient help, this difficulty was gradually overcome. According to the semester exams, 48% of the Marxism-Leninism grades were "Excellent," 32% were "Good," 18% were "Medium" (passing), and 2% were "Poor" (failing). According to the usual research assignment grades for political economy, "Excellent" accounted for 13%, "Good" accounted for 80%, "Medium" (passing) accounted for 6%, and "Poor" (failing) accounted for 1%. According to learning checks in Russian, "Excellent" and "Good" accounted for 77%, "Medium" (passing) accounted for 13%, and "Poor" (failing) accounted for 10%.

　　中国人民大学是怎样培养研究生的
    张腾霄　周铭
    中国人民大学为了有计划有步骤地培养大批教员和专家，去年在校内抽调政治文化水平较高的干部和学生二百二十名，并吸收全国各地大学院校进步教授和讲师助教一百余人，作为研究生，在各教研室领导下按照计划进行独立研究工作。现全校共有四十一个研究室，经半年来的努力，已取得不少经验。
    研究生的学习期限，根据目前的需要，暂定为两年。部分校外研究人员由于特殊的原因，学习期限缩短为一年，学习期满后，仍回到各地大学院校工作。
    人民大学的研究生，由于很多均已经受过高等教育，有的并经过长期革命斗争的锻炼，因而对他们进行教育，主要目的是进一步提高政治理论，掌握与精通某一门科学知识技能，因此，课程的特点是比较集中与精炼的。第一年必修科目为政治经济学、马列主义、俄文和一门有关业务的一般理论科目；第二年为专门业务学习，具体科目随各教研室的不同业务而定，一般是二门至四门。为了真正造就专业的人材，除了业务必修科目之外，其他选修科目对于每一个研究生说来，并不是齐头并进的。而是根据他们的专业来决定课程的轻重，多寡与先后次序。这样既有可能精通自己的专业，又照顾了本专业所必需的各方面的知识。
    我们两年或一年的研究生课程的分量与深度虽有所不同，但对政治理论与专业课程的安排都是并重的。开始学习时，少数研究生只想学习专门业务，忽视政治理论的学习，特别是部分校外来的研究人员则表现更为严重。认为学习业务没有政治理论基础亦可精通。事实证明这种思想是完全错误的。他们不了解有无政治理论和为人民服务的观点，是新旧教育基本的区别。不了解没有高深的政治理论知识，真正想精通与掌握自己的专业是不可能的。拿法律来说罢，如果不了解法律与政治经济的正确关系，便不可能正确处理法律的问题。再拿经济来说，如果对于马列主义政治经济学原理都不了解或没有系统的了解，同样是无法提高自己的业务水平的。
    研究生的教学过程和学生大体上是一致的。讲授、习明纳尔、实习、实验、参观、生产实习和辅导，对于研究生同样是适用的。但是在这个教学过程中，研究生比较学生是提高了一步。在进行讲授的时候，主要是对于基本理论给以透彻的发挥。并指定参考书，主要是马列主义的原著，由研究生进行独立的研究。研究时要求注意系统性，不允许无中心和零乱的学习现象。在进行习明纳尔学习时，学生主要是在教员直接领导下进行有准备的有重点的系统地讨论，虽有发言提纲，但不强调精辟的系统的文字报告。而研究生则不然，在进行讨论之前，必须有上述的文字报告，这种报告并经过教授检查，然后向大家报告。经过广泛深入的讨论与争辩，最后才由教授批判，做结论。关于业务方面，每学期都要有自己独立的研究，并把研究结果和心得作一次论文，这一论文，从内容到文字都要经过自己深入的研究。同时每个研究生每学期在该专业教研室的会议上至少还要做一次关于本业务方面的专题讲演。第二学年要进行科学研究工作，在学校每年举行的科学讨论会中，要有研究生的科学研究报告。关于生产实习，研究生是十分重视的，不但要到企业机关去实习，而且还要进行教学的实习，因为他们将来都是科学教育工作者。生产实习是要把已学习到的科学理论带到实际中去应用，以使自己的理论更巩固、更充实、更丰富。从研究生的全部学习过程看来，主要是发挥独立研究的精神。每个研究生都有自己两年独立的学习计划和研究计划，包括他们全部学习过程中的学习和科学研究的工作。他们每周除讲授与习明纳尔等十二——十五小时外，其他都是独立进行研究的时间。不过他们的研究工作不是由自己摸索，而是要在教授直接指导下，有计划、有组织的研究。所有教授都要为他们指导研究工作所应遵循的方向，并帮助解决在研究过程中所发生的具体的困难。
    在教学过程中，我们注意引导研究生随时注意中国的实际（特别是习明纳尔的学习），这样既能结合实际，又能充实和巩固理论的学习，在配合着理论的学习，我们法律系各教研室研究生曾到北京市人民法院进行参观，当时是一件刑事犯应不应死刑的问题，曾引起大家热烈的争论，这样便能使我们的理论与实际更接近，又能丰富我们的理论。
    根据这样的学习方法，在这一学期，我们收到了很大的成绩。首先是提高了学习的信心，当开始宣布教育计划时，有的人感到分量重，担心完不成学习任务，但经过几个月的学习，特别是每个人订出自己的具体计划后，信心便增强了，不仅克服了攻读马列原著的困难，并且逐渐感到了兴趣。譬如开始读资本论第一章时，有不少的人说读不懂，甚至有某种程度的畏难心理。但是由于领导上抓得紧和苏联教授的积极耐心的帮助，便逐渐克服了这种困难。根据学期考试，马列主义成绩列为“优”等的占百分之四十八，列为“良”等的占百分之三十二，“中”等（及格）占百分之十八，“劣”等（不及格）占百分之二。政治经济学根据平时研究作业的成绩，“优”等占百分之十三，“良”等占百分之八十，“中”等（及格）占百分之六，“劣”等（不及格）占百分之一。俄文根据学习检查，“优”“良”两等占百分之七十七，“中”等（及格）占百分之十三，“劣”等（不及格）占百分之十。
