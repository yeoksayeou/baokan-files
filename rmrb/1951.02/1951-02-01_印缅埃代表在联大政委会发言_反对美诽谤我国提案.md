Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 30th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee met on the morning of January 29th to continue discussing the Korean question.

Shortly after the meeting began, the Arab and Asian countries group put forward their newly revised proposal regarding holding a seven-nation conference to seek a basis for resolving the Korean question and other Far Eastern issues. The new proposal stated that the participants in this conference "shall agree at the first meeting on appropriate measures for a ceasefire in Korea, and after such measures have been implemented, shall continue to give further consideration."

Danish representative Borberg spoke first, shortly before distributing the twelve-nation amended proposal. He said he supported the U.S. proposal.

Dutch representative van Heuven Goedhart spoke next. He said that if the twelve-nation proposal were put to a vote, his delegation would abstain.

Representatives from Belgium, the Dominican Republic, and Liberia supported the U.S. proposal.

French representative Lacoste similarly surrendered to the unreasonable demands of the U.S. ruling clique to condemn the government of the People's Republic of China. He also supported the amendment distributed by the Lebanese delegation at the meeting. This amendment added the following supplement to the section of the U.S. proposal stipulating the establishment of a committee composed of members of the Collective Measures Committee responsible for studying collective measures: "It goes without saying that if the Conciliation Committee (which the U.S. proposal stipulates should be composed of the President of the United Nations General Assembly and two others designated by him) reports satisfactory progress in its work, the Committee (referring to the aforementioned ad hoc committee) shall have the right to postpone submitting its report."

Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu attacked Indian representative Rau and other representatives' efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean question. The morning session adjourned at this point.

At the afternoon session, the first to speak was Lebanese representative Malik. He formally put forward the aforementioned amendment to the U.S. proposal. Malik also proposed another amendment, revising the preamble of the U.S. proposal. In conclusion, Malik asked the U.S. not to engage in procedural debates and to agree to vote on the twelve-nation proposal first.

Next, Burmese representative Barrington spoke. He said that Burma could not support the U.S. proposal. The Burmese delegation believes that declaring the government of the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" is an oversimplification of the problem. Barrington further said that the Chinese government has expressed its willingness to negotiate. It seems that the representatives who support the U.S. proposal are "eager to close" the "door" to negotiations. Furthermore, Burma has serious doubts about the U.S. proposal due to the spirit pervading it. Barrington pointed out that Burma is a member of the Collective Measures Committee, and if the U.S. proposal is adopted, a committee will be created from this committee to study collective measures. However, the Burmese representative feels that it is inappropriate for Burma to participate in this committee because Burma does not support the U.S. proposal. Therefore, if the U.S. proposal is adopted, the Burmese delegation will reserve the right to state its position. Icelandic representative Thor Thors supported the U.S. proposal and opposed the twelve-nation proposal.

Subsequently, the next speaker, Indian representative Rau, commented on the various criticisms of the proposal of the twelve Asian and Arab countries. Rau pointed out that the amendments made to the twelve-nation proposal were to address criticisms that it did not guarantee priority consideration of ceasefire requirements. Regarding the criticism that the twelve-nation proposal did not declare China an "aggressor," Rau reiterated that India does not believe that China's actions in Korea were out of aggressive intentions, but rather may have been due to fears felt regarding the integrity of China's territory.

Rau also said that, moreover, the issue of aggression is not as simple as it initially appears. Rau pointed out that condemning the government of the People's Republic of China in one move implies recognition. He said that he did not understand how the majority of the United Nations, since it does not recognize it, could vote to condemn it. Rau said that since some people have said in their speeches that passing the U.S. proposal does not close the door to negotiations, he felt it necessary to state that the Indian government has received the most authoritative notice that passing a proposal condemning China will eliminate the possibility of a peaceful resolution. Rau also said that to condemn first and then suggest negotiations "shows that we are not serious about either condemnation or negotiation."

The Norwegian representative supported the U.S. proposal.

Egyptian representative Fawzi endorsed Rau's argument that the possibility of a peaceful resolution still exists. Fawzi pointed out that the U.S. delegation's assertion that the U.S. proposal is completely consistent with the twelve-nation proposal, but then refuses to support the twelve-nation proposal, is self-contradictory. Fawzi said: "Unfortunately, not only the position of the U.S. delegation, but also the positions of several other delegations are illogical. These other delegations acknowledge that peaceful methods have not been exhausted, but have adopted an attitude that runs counter to the goal of a peaceful resolution to the problem and first trying all peaceful methods in accordance with the United Nations Charter before taking other measures." Fawzi also said that the sponsors of the twelve-nation proposal believe that: "Apart from negotiations between the parties concerned, any method is obviously insufficient."

Australian representative Shaw said he could not support the twelve-nation proposal. The Colombian representative also supported the U.S. proposal and opposed the twelve-nation proposal.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy suggested adjournment because he had not received instructions regarding the revised twelve-nation proposal. Chairman U Than Nyunt put this question to a vote, and the Political Committee rejected the proposal to adjourn. Katz-Suchy then requested to speak on January 30th.

The Mexican representative supported the U.S. proposal.

Syrian representative El-Khouri advocated reconciliation. He also emphasized that the U.S. proposal would not promote a resolution to the problem. The U.S. proposal will not only fail to resolve the conflict, but will also expand the war. Syria will not support any such proposal. El-Khouri asked: Why should the United Nations expand the war simply because it cannot stop the war? He urged all representatives who oppose the twelve-nation proposal to reconsider their attitude.

The Political Committee then adjourned. The next meeting will be held on the 30th.

### 印缅埃代表在联大政委会发言  反对美诽谤我国提案

　　印缅埃代表在联大政委会发言
    反对美诽谤我国提案
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：联合国大会政治委员会一月二十九日上午开会，继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    开会不久，阿拉伯及亚洲各国集团即提出他们新近加以修正的关于举行七国会议以寻求解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的基础的提案新提案称：这一会议的参与者“将于首次会议中商定在朝鲜停火的适当办法，并在这种办法付诸实施后，再继续作进一步的考虑”。
    丹麦代表波尔堡在分发十二国的修正提案之前不久首先发言。他说他支持美国的提案。
    荷兰代表巴鲁塞克继起发言。他说，如果十二国提案付诸表决，他的代表团将弃权。
    比利时、多米尼加共和国与利比里亚等国代表支持美国提案。
    法国代表拉哥斯特同样向美国统治集团所提出的谴责中华人民共和国政府的无理要求投降。他同时支持黎巴嫩代表团在会议上散发的修正案。这一修正案对美国提案中规定建立一个由集体措施委员会委员组成的委员会负责研究集体措施一节提出下列补充：“如果斡旋委员会（这是美国提案规定由联合国大会主席与他所指定的另外两人组成的）报告其工作有令人满意的进展，则委员会（指上项特设委员会）有权延迟提出报告，这一点自不待言。”
    国民党分子蒋廷黻攻击印度代表劳氏及其他代表求取和平解决朝鲜问题的努力。上午会议至此休会。
    在下午会议上，第一个发言的是黎巴嫩代表麦里克。他正式对美国提案提出了上面已说过的修正案。麦里克并提出另一修正案，修改美国提案的序言。麦里克在结语中要美国不要从事程序问题的争辩而同意首先表决十二国提案。
    接着缅甸代表巴林顿发言。他说，缅甸不能支持美国提案。缅甸代表团认为：宣布中华人民共和国政府为“侵略者”，是把问题太简单化了。巴林顿进一步说：中国政府已经表示愿意进行谈判。看来，支持美国提案的代表们“急于要关闭”谈判之“门”。此外，缅甸由于贯穿在美国提案中的精神而对该提案怀有严重怀疑。巴林顿指出：缅甸是集体措施委员会的委员，如果美国提案获得通过，将由这个委员会中再产生一个委员会来研究集体措施。但是，缅甸代表感到缅甸参加这个委员会是不适当的，因为缅甸并不支持美国的提案。所以，如果美国提案获得通过，缅甸代表团将保留声明其态度的权利，冰岛代表陶氏支持美国提案，反对十二国提案。
    继而次一发言者印度代表劳氏评论了对于十二个亚洲和阿拉伯国家的提案的各种批评。劳氏指出，十二国提案中所作的修正是为了应付关于它并不保证优先考虑停火要求的批评。关于对十二国提案并不宣布中国为“侵略者”的批评，劳氏重申：印度并不认为中国在朝鲜的行动是出诸侵略的意图的，而认为这可能是出于在中国领土之完整方面所感到的恐惧。
    劳氏并说：况且，侵略问题并不是像初看起来那么简单。劳氏指出，谴责中华人民共和国政府一举意味着承认。他说，他不懂联合国的大多数既然并不承认它，怎么能够投票谴责它。劳氏说，既然有些人在说话中表示如像通过美国提案并不关闭谈判之门，他觉得必须声明，印度政府已获得最权威的通知，即通过谴责中国的提案就将消除和平解决的可能性。劳氏并说，始而谴责，继而建议谈判，这就“表明我们对谴责或谈判都不是认真的”。
    挪威代表支持美国的提案。
    埃及代表法齐拥护劳氏的论点，即和平解决的可能性仍然存在。法齐指出，美国代表团断言美国提案与十二国提案完全一致，但又拒绝支持十二国提案，自相矛盾。法齐说：“不幸，不仅仅是美国代表团的立场而且其他若干代表团的立场也是不合逻辑。这些其他代表团承认和平方法尚未用尽，但又采取了一种与和平解决问题以及先按照联合国宪章试尽一切和平方法然后再采取其他措施的目标背道而驰的态度。”法齐又说，十二国提案的提案国认为：“除了有关方面进行谈判外，任何办法都是显然不够的。”
    澳大利亚代表尚恩说，他不能支持十二国提案。哥伦比亚代表也支持美国提案，反对十二国提案。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪建议休会，因为他未接到有关修正过的十二国提案的指示。主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹将这个问题提付表决，政委会否决了休会的提议。卡茨·苏琪接着要求在一月三十日发言。
    墨西哥代表拥护美国提案。
    叙利亚代表埃尔——古里主张和解。他并且强调说，美国提案将不能促进问题的解决。美国提案不但不能解决冲突，并且会扩大战争。叙利亚将不支持任何这样的提案。埃尔——古里问道：为什么联合国仅仅因为不能使战争停止而就要扩大战争呢？他力促一切反对十二国提案的代表们重新考虑他们的态度。
    政委会继即休会。下次会议将在三十日举行。
