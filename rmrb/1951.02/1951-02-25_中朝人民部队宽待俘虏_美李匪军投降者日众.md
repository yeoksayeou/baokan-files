Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 23rd: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's policy of treating prisoners of war generously has had a significant impact on the enemy forces. The phenomenon of American invading troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet army soldiers surrendering to the Korean and Chinese People's forces is becoming more and more common. During the counterattack by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Hengcheng area on the Han River front, when encountering small groups of enemy troops or stragglers, a blockade and encirclement, combined with shouting and waving military caps, often led to their surrender. One battalion of a certain Volunteer Army unit combined combat with political disintegration work, capturing over a thousand enemy soldiers in two days while suffering only fourteen casualties and expending only a few hundred rounds of ammunition. Non-combatant personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's forces often use gestures to beckon enemy stragglers to surrender. While a staff member of a certain Volunteer Army unit was inspecting captured materials on the battlefield, two African-American soldiers from the United States Army voluntarily surrendered to him. A certain Volunteer Army unit once escorted over eight hundred prisoners to the rear with a small number of troops, crossing ten miles of mountains at night, and not a single prisoner fell behind.

　　中朝人民部队宽待俘虏
    美李匪军投降者日众
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军宽待俘虏的政策，已对敌军发生了显著影响。美国侵略军和李承晚伪军士兵向朝、中人民部队投降的现象已经愈来愈多。中国人民志愿军在汉江前线横城地区的反攻中，遇到小股敌军或散兵，一加阻击包围，常常可以用喊话或摇动军帽使他们投降。志愿军某部一营在作战中结合政治瓦解工作，两天中俘敌一千余人，而自己仅伤亡十四人，消耗子弹数百发。朝、中人民部队的非战斗人员常常用手势把敌军散兵招来投降。志愿军某工作人员在战地清查缴获物资时，就有两名美国黑人士兵自动向他投降。志愿军某部一次以少数部队押送八百多名俘虏到后方去，夜间翻越十里路的大山，一个俘虏也没有掉队。
