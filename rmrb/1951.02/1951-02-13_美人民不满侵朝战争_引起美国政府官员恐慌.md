　　American People Dissatisfied with the Korean War
　  引起美国政府官员恐慌
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th — As the United States' aggressive policy in Korea suffers disastrous defeats and faces its end, the American people are increasingly skeptical and dissatisfied with the Truman government's use of deceptive propaganda to continue driving American youth to their deaths in Korea. According to a dispatch from Washington by Associated Press reporter Scheldow on the 4th, this situation has caused "considerable concern among certain people in Washington—especially in the State Department." They fear that despite Truman and Acheson's desperate advocacy for the need to continue the aggressive war in Korea, "the government's current policy on the Korean issue is not fully understood by the people, and therefore the government lacks a large amount of support that it could get." Scheldow admitted: "Officials say that the results of opinion polls and letters written to members of Congress prove that: 1. Many people do not understand the purpose of the Korean War; 2. Many people are demanding the withdrawal of United Nations forces. This remains a problem that the government has not solved." In this situation, Wall Street strategists are troubled by the question of how to stir up aggressive war sentiment.

　　美人民不满侵朝战争
　  引起美国政府官员恐慌
    【新华社十二日讯】在美国侵略朝鲜政策遭到惨败而面临末路的情况下，美国人民对杜鲁门政府利用欺骗宣传继续驱使美国青年到朝鲜去送死的行为已日益感到怀疑和不满。据美联社记者薛多威四日自华盛顿发出的电讯透露，这种情况已引起“华盛顿某些人士——特别是在国务院中——的相当的忧虑”。他们恐惧：尽管杜鲁门——艾奇逊拚命鼓吹美国继续侵略朝鲜战争的必要，但是“政府目前对朝鲜问题的政策却并没有被人们所充分了解，因此政府就缺少可以得到的大量支持”。薛多威供认：“官员们对舆论调查的结果以及人们写给国会议员的信件据说证明了：一、许多人不了解朝鲜战争的目的；二、许多人要求撤退联合国部队。这仍是政府尚未解决的问题。”在这种情形下，华尔街的策士们正在为应如何煽起侵略战争情绪这个问题而苦恼。
