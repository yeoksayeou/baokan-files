Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 16th: Qamdo dispatch: The newly liberated Qamdo area of western Xikang Province held its first People's Representative Conference from December 27th of last year to January 2nd of this year. This was an unprecedented conference in the history of the Tibetan people in the Qamdo area. The Qamdo area includes thirty-three dzongs (equivalent to counties) west of the Jinsha River and on both banks of the Lancang River. The 151 representatives attending the meeting included Tusi, headmen, senior lamas, herdsmen, merchants, farmers, and military cadres.

　　The conference elected Wang Qimei, Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qamdo, Bangda Doji, Tibetan member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, Pingcuo Wangjie, Qamdo Living Buddha Pabala Losang Longduo Hutuktu, Chaya County Living Buddha Luodeng Xirao Hutuktu, former Tibetan Kangding Border Envoy Apé, Degé County Tusi Jiangyang Baimu (female), and the glorious uprising former Tibetan Army ninth generation Bengesang Wangtang, and others as the presidium. The conference first listened to reports by Wang Qimei and Apé. In his report, Wang Qimei reiterated the People's Liberation Army's policy on entering Tibet, saying: "The People's Liberation Army resolutely protects the lives and property of all monks and lay people in Tibet, protects the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief, and protects all lama temples." Apé described his personal experience in his report: I have observed the words and deeds of the People's Liberation Army very carefully. I fully understand that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, no matter what they do, are acting entirely in accordance with the will of the people and striving to improve the people's lives. The conference held a heated discussion on the two reports. The representatives all expressed their sincere support for the Central People's Government's various policies for the liberation of Tibet. During the conference, whenever Chairman Mao's wise leadership in leading the Tibetan people to get rid of imperialist oppression and achieve a great turnaround was mentioned, the venue immediately resounded with thunderous applause.

　　The conference focused on discussing how to implement the Central People's Government's established national policy of peacefully resolving the Tibet issue. This was a matter of great concern to the representatives. They spoke enthusiastically and unanimously agreed that striving for a peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue is most in line with the interests of the Tibetan people. The conference resolved to establish the Qamdo Area Monks and Lay People Preparatory Committee for Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and issued a letter of signature for striving for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The conference also discussed in detail the issues of the political power organization, economic and cultural work, etc. in the Qamdo area, and established the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee to uniformly lead all work in the area. Finally, the conference passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and a telegram of greetings to the commanders and fighters on the Kangding-Tibet front. The congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao stated: We resolutely support the Common Program and the Central People's Government's policy of peacefully liberating Tibet, and warmly hope that all Tibetan people will quickly return to the big family of the motherland and create our free and happy lives.

　　The broad masses of Tibetan people in the Qamdo area have expressed their utmost support for this conference. The people of Chaya County, three hundred li away, spontaneously organized a dance troupe and rushed to Qamdo three days before the meeting to celebrate. The representatives also expressed their great satisfaction with the success of the conference. Living Buddha Paqu of Leiwuqi said: "Our nation has a new life of freedom and happiness today, and we should be grateful to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao." The people of Qamdo held a grand rally on January 3 to celebrate the success of the conference and the establishment of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee. At the meeting, Pingcuo Wangjie, Deputy Director of the Liberation Committee, called on the Tibetan people to unite as one, strive to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating the Tibetan people, and drive the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism out of Tibet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 16th: Qamdo dispatch: The Xikang Province Qamdo Area Monks and Lay People Preparatory Committee for Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was established on December 31st of last year at the first People's Representative Conference in the Qamdo area. Former Tibetan Kangding Border Envoy Apé was appointed as the director of the committee. The committee issued a letter of signature on January 1st of this year to strive for the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

　　The letter of signature wrote: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are concerned about the Tibetan compatriots, and specially sent the People's Liberation Army to enter Kangding-Tibet to help the Tibetan compatriots liberate themselves from imperialist oppression. Now the Qamdo area has been liberated, and the Qamdo Area People's Representative Conference has been convened, and the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee has been established. The Tibetan representatives at the meeting warmly hope that the Lhasa authorities will sincerely send representatives to conduct peace talks. This is the wish of all Tibetan people. We have proven from all the facts that the Central People's Government ordered the People's Liberation Army to march into Tibet entirely to help the Tibetan people expel the British and American imperialist forces from Tibet and consolidate national defense, and not to oppress the Tibetan people. In particular, the Central People's Government recognizes the Dalai Lama's political status, respects freedom of religious belief, protects all the property of the Lama temples, and officials who have stood on the side of the people in the past will continue to be employed as usual. None of these measures are unacceptable to the Lhasa authorities. In the event that they are too deeply blinded by imperialism and are not easy to understand for a while, in order to unify the motherland, unite all nationalities, and strive for the success of peaceful liberation, we will not stop until we achieve the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The first to sign the letter of signature were Qamdo Living Buddha Pabala Losang Longduo Hutuktu and Chaya County Living Buddha Luodeng Xirao Hutuktu. The representatives attending the first People's Representative Conference in the Qamdo area all signed the letter of signature.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 16th: Qamdo dispatch: The Xikang Province Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee was established on January 1st at the first People's Representative Conference in the Qamdo area. The Southwest Military and Political Committee appointed Wang Qimei as the director, Qamdo Living Buddha Pabala Losang Longduo Hutuktu, former Tibetan Kangding Border Envoy Apé, Chaya County Living Buddha Luodeng Xirao Hutuktu, Southwest Military and Political Committee member Bangda Doji, Xikang Province Degé County Tusi Jiangyang Baimu (female), Pingcuo Wangjie, Hui Yiran, and uprising Tibetan Army ninth generation Bengesang Wangtang as deputy directors, and Zhang Xilangji, Weisár Kenzen, Xia Zhongyuan, Ka Gu Zhugu, Losang Jicun, and others as ninety-five members. The establishment of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee marks the beginning of the autonomous life of the Tibetan people west of the Jinsha River under the leadership of the Central People's Government.

　　西康昌都地区举行首届人民代表会议        
    成立争取和平解放西藏工委会
    【新华社重庆十六日电】昌都讯：新解放的西康省西部昌都地区，于去年十二月二十七日至今年一月二日举行了第一届人民代表会议。这是昌都地区藏族人民史无前例的会议。昌都地区包括金沙江以西、澜沧江两岸的三十三宗（相当于县）。出席会议的代表有土司、头人、大喇嘛、牧民、商民、农民及部队干部等一百五十一人。
    会议选出中国人民解放军驻昌都部队副政治委员王其梅、西南军政委员会藏族委员邦达多吉、凭错旺阶、昌都活佛怕巴拉洛桑龙多呼图克图、察雅县活佛罗登协绕呼图克图、前西藏康藏边使阿沛、德格县土司降央白母（女）和光荣起义的前藏军第九代本格桑旺堂等九人为主席团。会议首先听取了王其梅和阿沛的报告。王其梅在报告中重申人民解放军的入藏政策说：“人民解放军坚决保护西藏全体僧俗人民的生命财产，保护西藏人民的宗教信仰自由，保护一切喇嘛寺庙。”阿沛在报告中叙述他的亲身体验说：我十分谨慎地观察过解放军的言行。我完全明白了共产党和人民解放军无论办什么事，都是完全按照人民的意志，为改善人民的生活而奋斗的。会议对两个报告展开了热烈讨论。代表们对中央人民政府解放西藏的各种政策，都表示衷心拥护。会议中每提到毛主席英明领导藏族人民摆脱帝国主义压迫而大翻身的时候，会场立即响起不绝的掌声。
    会议着重讨论了如何贯彻中央人民政府和平解决西藏的既定国策。这是代表们极关心的问题。他们踊跃发言，一致认为：争取和平解决西藏最符合西藏人民的利益。会议决议成立昌都地区僧俗人民争取和平解放西藏工作委员会，并发出为争取和平解放西藏的签名书。会议还详细讨论了昌都地区的政权组织及经济、文化工作等问题，并成立了昌都地区人民解放委员会，统一领导全区各项工作。会议最后通过了向毛主席致敬电和致电慰问康藏前线指战员。向毛主席致敬电称：我们坚决拥护共同纲领和中央人民政府和平解放西藏的方针和政策，热烈希望全藏族人民迅速回到祖国大家庭来，创造我们自由幸福的生活。
    昌都地区广大藏族人民，对这次会议都极表拥护。三百里外的察雅县人民自动组织了一个跳舞队，在开会前三天就赶到昌都来庆贺。代表们对这次会议的成功也极表满意。类乌齐活佛怕屈说：“我们的民族，今天有了自由幸福的新生活，我们应当感激中国共产党和毛主席。”昌都人民为庆祝这次会议的成功和昌都地区人民解放委员会的成立，曾于一月三日举行盛大集会庆祝。会上，解放委员会副主任凭错旺阶号召藏族人民一致团结起来，努力支援人民解放军解放西藏人民，把英、美帝国主义的侵略势力赶出西藏。
    【新华社重庆十六日电】昌都讯：西康省昌都地区僧俗人民争取和平解放西藏工作委员会已于去年十二月三十一日在昌都地区第一届人民代表会议上成立，由前西藏康藏边使阿沛任该委员会主任。该会于本年一月一日发出为争取和平解放西藏签名书。
    签名书写道：中央人民政府毛泽东主席和中国人民解放军朱德总司令关怀藏族同胞，特派遣人民解放军进入康藏，帮助藏族同胞从帝国主义压迫下解放出来。现在昌都地区已经获得解放，并召开了昌都地区人民代表会议，同时成立了昌都地区人民解放委员会。会上的藏族代表热烈希望拉萨当局真诚地派代表前来进行和谈。此为全体藏族人民的愿望。我们从所有的事实中得到证明：中央人民政府命令人民解放军进军西藏，完全是为了帮助藏族人民驱逐英、美帝国主义势力出西藏，巩固国防，而不是来压迫西藏人民的。特别是中央人民政府承认达赖活佛在政治上的权位，尊重宗教信仰自由，保护喇嘛寺的一切财产，过去官员一经站到人民方面来仍照常供职，这些措施没有一件为拉萨当局所不能接受。万一他们受帝国主义蒙蔽太深，一时不易了解，我们为了祖国的统一，各民族的团结，争取和平解放的成功，不达到和平解放西藏，决不停止。首先在签名书上签名的是昌都活佛怕巴拉洛桑龙多呼图克图、察雅县活佛罗登协绕呼图克图。出席昌都地区第一届人民代表会议的代表，都在签名书上签了名。
    【新华社重庆十六日电】昌都讯：西康省昌都地区人民解放委员会已于一月一日在昌都地区第一届人民代表会议上成立。西南军政委员会任命王其梅为主任，昌都活佛怕巴拉洛桑龙多呼图克图、前西藏康藏边使阿沛、察雅县活佛罗登协绕呼图克图、西南军政委员会委员邦达多吉、西康省德格县土司降央白母（女）、凭错旺阶、惠毅然、起义藏军第九代本格桑旺堂为副主任，张西郎吉、威萨尔兼曾、夏仲远、喀固朱古、洛桑吉村等九十五人为委员。昌都地区人民解放委员会的成立，标志着金沙江以西藏族人民在中央人民政府领导下自治生活的开始。
