　　The Home of Li Tianfu, a Soldier of the Fourth Field Army

　　A few days before the Lunar New Year's Eve, I visited the home of Li Tianfu, a soldier of the Fourth Field Army, in Mengying Village, Xinxiang. As soon as I entered the gate, I felt the atmosphere of the New Year. The courtyard was swept very clean. A young woman was dyeing cloth in the yard. After I explained my purpose, she led me into the house.

　　The room was beautifully decorated: on the wall hung a revolutionary soldier certificate framed with glass mirrors, and New Year's cards from the mayor of Xinxiang; the lacquered table gleamed, and on it were neatly arranged inkstones, brushes, winter school textbooks, and newly bought New Year pictures; the most eye-catching thing was the labor model certificate. Just as I was about to say something, Tianfu's mother—this old lady in her sixties, dressed in black cloth and wearing a black velvet hat, with a ruddy face and a smile—stood up and pointed to the certificate, saying, "Are you looking at the certificate? This was earned by Tianfu's family. Her name is Miao Xiuying, and she was elected as a labor model by the masses and even attended the provincial labor model conference! She was given prizes and a silver medal (badge). As her mother-in-law, I am really happy!"

　　Speaking of Miao Xiuying, the neighbors all praised her: capable and filial. Her family farms six mu and eight fen of land. Except for the plowing and sowing done by the village, all the other work is done by Xiuying herself. She said, "It's not that I can't do it, why bother the village?" Because she is diligent in labor, the grain she harvests is enough for the two of them to eat. Last year, all six mu of land were planted with wheat and fertilized with eight cartloads of manure; and there was a good snowfall, so a good harvest is expected this year. Xiuying is not only good at production but also an active learner. She has now recognized more than 700 characters and can correspond with her husband. Last winter, she was selected as a learning model in the whole village, and the stationery on the table is the prize she received. Last year, she joined the Communist Youth League, and this year she was elected as a member of the women's representative meeting of the whole village. This eighteen-year-old young person has become a person loved by the masses.

　　The mother is very clear about all this, so she loves and cares for her daughter-in-law very much. When Xiuying goes out to attend meetings, she cooks meals for her; if she returns late, she goes to look for her herself. The old lady said, "The New Year is coming, and young people like to wear good clothes. I bought her seven chi of blue broadcloth to make a jacket, and the trousers are made of cloth woven by herself. Now it is being dyed. A new black trousers and blue jacket look very good!"

　　Speaking of the government's and the masses' care for military dependents, the old lady smiled. She said, "It's very good. No matter what meeting is held, we are invited to the upper seats. During the wheat harvest, we are invited to eat in the city and watch movies. Although the substitute farming is not very good yet, our area has been liberated for less than two years, so it's not bad; besides, with my daughter-in-law, she can manage the work in the fields."

　　Xiuying finished dyeing the cloth and came into the house to get something. Her mother-in-law said to her, "Write a letter to Tianfu, tell him that he doesn't need to worry about the family, and tell him to work hard there and protect our country well; tell him about your being a labor model and send him a picture of you wearing the silver medal!" Xiuying readily agreed and added, "I'm also challenging him!" Saying that, she ran out, as if she was a little embarrassed.

　　When I was far away from her house, I still heard the song "The sun in the liberated area is red and red...", this was sung by Xiuying.

　　四野战士李天福的家
    旧历除夕的前几天，我去新乡孟营村拜访了第四野战军战士李天福的家。刚进大门，便感到一种新年的气息。院子打扫得很干净。一个年青的妇女正在院里染布，当说明来意后，她把我领进屋里。
    屋里摆设得很漂亮：墙上挂着用玻璃镜镶了的革命军人证明书，新乡市长的贺年片；油漆桌子闪闪发光，桌上摆着整齐的墨盒、笔、冬学课本，还有刚买来的年画；最引人注意的是那张劳动模范奖状。我刚想说什么，天福的母亲——这位六十多岁的老人家，身着黑色的布衣，戴着黑绒帽子，红润润的脸上浮着微笑，她站起来指着奖状说：“你看的是奖状吗？这是俺天福家得的。她叫苗秀英，被群众选为劳动模范了，还参加省劳动模范大会哩！发给了奖品，银牌（奖章）。我当娘的心里可真高兴！”
    提起苗秀英来，邻居个个夸奖：又能干活，又孝顺。她家种着六亩八分地，除村里给耕、耩外，其他活全由秀英自己干。她说：“咱不是干不了，麻烦村里干什么？”因为她勤于劳动，打的粮食，足够娘俩个吃用。去年六亩多地全种上了麦子，上了八大车粪；又下了好雪，今年丰收有望。秀英不光生产好，学习也是积极分子。现在已认到七百多字，能和丈夫通信了。去年冬天她被选为全村的学习模范，桌上摆着的那些文具，就是得的奖品。她在去年已加入了青年团，今年又被选为全村妇女代表会的委员。这个十八岁的青年人，已成为群众爱戴的人物了。
    对于这些，当娘的心里很明白，因此对儿媳妇又疼又爱。秀英出去开会，她就做好饭等她；回来的晚了，就亲自去找。老人家说：“年到了，年青的爱穿好的，我给她买了七尺蓝洋布作了个褂子，裤子是自己织的布，现在才染，黑裤蓝褂一身新，多好！”
    谈起政府和群众对军属的照顾来，老大娘笑了。她说：“可好，无论开什么会，都是把咱请到上席。过麦时还请到城里吃饭，看电影。代耕虽然还不十分好，咱这里解放还不到两年，总算不错；再说，有俺儿媳妇，地里的活作得过来。”
    秀英染完布，进屋拿东西。她娘向她说：“给天福写封信吧，就说家里不用他挂念，叫他在那里好好干，好好保护咱国家；把你当劳动模范的事告诉他，你戴着银牌照的像也给他寄一张！”秀英满口答应，并加上了一句：“我还向他挑战哩！”说着便跑了出去，好像有些不好意思。
    当离开她家很远时，我还听到“解放区的太阳是红又红……”的歌声，这是秀英唱的。
