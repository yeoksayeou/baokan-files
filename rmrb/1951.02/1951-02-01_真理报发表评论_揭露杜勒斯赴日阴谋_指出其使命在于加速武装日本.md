Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: *Pravda* observer, Terentyev, wrote in a commentary on Dulles' arrival in Japan: The hasty dispatch of Dulles to Japan comes after the failure of the adventure in Korea. The US imperialists are unwilling to abandon their aggressive plans, and are trying to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism to the greatest extent, to establish a Japanese aggressive army, and to rearm Japan. Dulles' mission is to speed up these things to the greatest extent and force Japan to rearm. Because the US imperialists believe that the Japanese Zaibatsu and militarists are the main pillars and allies for realizing the US's adventurous attempt to invade the Asian people.

    American newspapers spread official lies, saying that Dulles' mission is to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Such a statement may only be intended to deceive naive simpletons, because the world knows that it is actually the US that stubbornly undermines the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan within the purview of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The intention of the US imperialists is not to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, but to collude with the Japanese reactionaries, and to legitimize this collusion by concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan. They are even prepared to allow Japan to sign such a separate peace treaty with other countries of the US-British bloc, as long as the US is given priority in stationing occupation troops in Japan, and the US in fact maintains its occupation rule. With the help of such tricks, the bosses of Wall Street intend: first, to prevent the conclusion of a real peace treaty with Japan, because such a treaty would demilitarize and democratize Japan in accordance with existing international agreements; second, to maintain their control over their Japanese "partner," which is currently making increasing demands; and third, to maintain their superior position in Japan compared to other countries of the US-British bloc.

    Dulles's arrival in Tokyo will gradually prove that while preparing for military adventures in Europe, the US imperialists are also trying to ignite the flames of war in the Far East in order to retaliate for their failure in Korea.

　　真理报发表评论
    揭露杜勒斯赴日阴谋
    指出其使命在于加速武装日本
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：真理报观察家捷连特耶夫在评论杜勒斯抵日时写道：急忙派遣杜勒斯前往日本，是随着在朝鲜的冒险遭到失败之后而来的。美帝国主义者不愿放弃自己的侵略计划，力图最大限度地加速复活日本军国主义，建立日本侵略军队，重新武装日本。杜勒斯的使命，就在于最大限度地加快这些事情进行的速度，强使日本重新武装起来。因为美帝国主义者认为日本财阀和军国主义者，是实现美国冒险侵略亚洲人民的图谋的主要支柱和同盟者。
    美国报纸散布官方谎言，说什么杜勒斯的使命在于加速缔订对日和约。这样的说法或许只是打算欺骗天真的简单人罢了，因为举世深知，实际上正是美国顽固地破坏了外长会议权限内的对日和约的准备工作。美帝国主义者的用意不在于缔结全面的对日和约，而是在于与日本反动派进行共谋，并以缔结对日单独和约的方法使这种共谋合法化。他们甚至也准备容许日本与美英集团其他各国签订这样的单独和约，只要给美国以在日本驻留占领军的优先权，并且使美国在事实上仍然保持占领统治的话。借助这样的诡计，华尔街的头子们打算：第一，不许缔结真正的对日和约，因为这种和约就要根据现行国际协定使日本非军国主义化和民主化；第二，保持自己对日本“伙伴”的控制，这个“伙伴”在目前便提出了日益增大的要求；第三，保持自己在日本比美英集团其他各国优越的地位。
    杜勒斯之抵达东京，将逐步证明：美帝国主义者与它在欧洲准备军事冒险的同时，并力图在远东燃起战争的火焰，这样来为自己在朝鲜的失败进行报复。
