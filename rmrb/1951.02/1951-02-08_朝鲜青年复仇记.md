A Korean Youth's Revenge
By our reporter Tan Wenrui

The following story unfolded as the American invading forces were routed near Changjin Lake by the combined forces of the Chinese and Korean people.

In a bunker on a Chinese People's Volunteer Army position near Gutuli, a young Korean soldier who had defected from the U.S. 7th Infantry Division brought in three disheveled American prisoners. Pointing at them, he said, "Yesterday they were my superiors and comrades, now they are my prisoners."

This patriotic Korean youth, named Li Shunzhi, was twenty-seven years old. He recounted, with deep sorrow, his experience of being driven, humiliated, and his subsequent resistance and revenge: He was a fisherman from a fishing village near Busan in southern Korea. He and his brother supported their paralyzed father, who was over sixty years old, by fishing. Under the oppression and bullying of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, life became unbearable. Two years ago, his brother, Li Shunze, and several other young fishermen fled "north," leaving the burden of supporting the entire family on Li Shunzhi's shoulders. One night in August 1950, two Syngman Rhee puppet policemen, under the pretext of checking household registrations, forced the illiterate Li Shunzhi to put his fingerprint on a roster and then took him away without explanation. In Busan, he was locked up with other innocent young people who had suffered the same fate. Two days later, they were taken by ship to Japan along with over a thousand others.

In Japan, they underwent twenty-five days of training, with American and Japanese personnel as instructors. During those twenty-five days, they spent four days learning to shoot, and the rest of the time was spent practicing cooking for the Americans and saluting them. After the training, they were assigned to different American units. Li Shunzhi became a private in the field artillery company of the 7th Battalion, 21st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Infantry Division. After a "landing exercise" in Yokohama, they were transported back to Korea.

Li Shunzhi angrily described the abuse they suffered at the hands of the American officers and soldiers: "We received no pay, wore old and torn American uniforms, ate the leftovers and scraps of the American soldiers, and worked as their orderlies, carrying things during marches and hauling ammunition during battles. Korean soldiers were not allowed to talk to each other, or they would be beaten and starved. The American soldiers were afraid of death and the cold, so they made us stand guard. Once, four American devils raped a Korean woman in a small village, and they ordered me to stand guard at the door..." As he said this, hatred shone in Li Shunzhi's eyes. He often thought of sacrificing his own life to kill a few American beasts to avenge himself and the people of his homeland. He said, "At that time, I really wished I could slaughter these sons of bitches!"

The U.S. 7th Infantry Division suffered a crushing defeat at Changjin Lake at the hands of the Chinese and Korean People's Army. Li Shunzhi felt an unspeakable joy watching the disgraceful plight of these American soldiers who were usually so arrogant and aggressive. As these beasts fled south from Gutuli, they scattered in all directions and were completely routed. An American officer and two soldiers from Li Shunzhi's company abandoned their artillery pieces and forced him to flee with them into the mountains, making him lead the way back to their unit. They hid in a cave for two days, suffering from cold and hunger. On the evening of the third day, the three Americans could no longer endure it. They ordered Li Shunzhi to go down the mountain to find food. Li Shunzhi, seeing his opportunity, pretended to be afraid to go down the mountain unless he could take a carbine with him. The American officer had no choice but to agree. As soon as Li Shunzhi had the gun in his hand, he immediately pointed it at the three American bandits, who were so frightened that they knelt down and begged for mercy. Li Shunzhi then escorted them down the mountain to find the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. On the way, he encountered a sentry of the Volunteer Army and was taken to this bunker.

After recounting his story of revenge, the Korean youth clenched his fist and said excitedly, "Let me take this American carbine I brought and join the People's Army to fight the American devils with you!" Then, he said cheerfully and excitedly, "I will meet my brother on the battlefield. I believe he is now fighting the American devils in the People's Army!"

Li Shunzhi has now been honorably approved to join the People's Army.

　　朝鲜青年复仇记
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    当美国侵略军在长津湖畔遭受中朝人民部队的追歼而狼狈溃逃的时候，发生了这样一个故事。
    在古土里附近中国人民志愿军阵地上的一个掩蔽部里，一位从美国侵略军第七师中跑来投诚的朝鲜青年士兵，带来了三个狼狈不堪的美国俘虏。他指着他们说：“昨天他们是我的上司和同伙，现在已成为我的俘虏了。”
    这个朝鲜的爱国青年名叫李顺植，二十七岁。他沉痛地叙述了他的被驱使被侮辱和反抗复仇的经过：他是朝鲜南部釜山附近一个渔村的渔民，兄弟俩靠打鱼为生，养活一个六十多岁半身瘫痪的老父。在李承晚伪政府的压榨欺凌下，日子过不下去了，哥哥李顺泽在两年前和另外几个青年渔民跑到“北边”去了，全家的生活担子就落在李顺植一个人身上。一九五○年八月的一个晚上，两个李承晚伪警以调查户口为名，强迫不识字的李顺植在一本名册上打下了手印，就不容分说地把他绑走了。到了釜山，他和其他有着同样不幸遭遇的无辜青年人关在一起。过了两天，他们一千多人被押上船开到日本去。
    在日本，他们受了二十五天的训练，教练都由美国人和日本人担任。在二十五天中学了四天射击，其余的时间就是练习给美国人做饭、向美国人行礼。训练完毕后，他们都被分别编入美国军队中，李顺植成了美军第七师第二十一团第七营野炮连的下等兵。他们曾到横滨去作了一次“登陆演习”，即被运回朝鲜。
    李顺植愤慨地叙述了美国官兵对他们虐待的情形说：“我们是没有薪饷的，穿的是美国兵穿旧穿破了的军服，吃的是美国兵吃剩和不吃的东西，工作是给他们当勤务，行军时扛东西，作战时搬炮弹。朝鲜籍士兵不准互相交谈，否则就要挨打罚饿。美国兵怕死怕冷，就要我们站岗。有一次四个美国鬼子在一个小村庄中强奸一个朝鲜女人，却要我在门口放哨……”说到这里，李顺植眼睛中放射出仇恨的光芒。他时常想拚掉自己的一条命去杀掉几个美国禽兽来为自己和他祖国人民复仇。他说：“当时我真恨不得宰了这几个狗杂种！”
    美军第七师在长津湖畔遭到了中朝人民军的痛击。李顺植眼看着这些平日耀武扬威的美国兵的狼狈相，心中有说不出的高兴。这些野兽们从古土里南逃时，已经东窜西散溃不成军。李顺植所属的那个连的一个美国军官和两个士兵丢下了大炮，强迫他一同逃上山去，他们逼着李顺植领路逃回他们的部队中去。在一个山洞里，他们躲了两天，又冻又饿。第三天的傍晚，三个美国人再也受不住了。他们命令李顺植下山去找食物，李顺植一想机会来了，他故意表示害怕下山，除非让他带着卡宾枪下去。那个美国军官不得已而同意了。枪一到了李顺植手里，他立即用枪口指着这三个美国强盗，那三个家伙吓得跪着求饶。李顺植于是就把他们押下山来找人民军和中国人民志愿军，在路上他碰见了志愿军的一位哨兵，就被带到这个掩蔽部里来。
    这个朝鲜青年叙述完了他复仇的经过后，握紧了拳头，激动地说：“让我拿着我带来的这支美国卡宾枪参加人民军，和你们一起去打美国鬼子吧！”接着，他愉快而兴奋地说：“我会在战场上遇见我的哥哥，我相信他现在会在人民军中打美国鬼子！”
    现在李顺植已经光荣地被批准参加了人民军。
