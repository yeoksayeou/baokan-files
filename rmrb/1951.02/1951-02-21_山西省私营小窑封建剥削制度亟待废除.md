Title: The Feudal Exploitation System in Private Small Coal Kilns in Shanxi Province Urgently Needs to Be Abolished

To the Editor:

　　More than 80% of the 3,017 mine entrances in Shanxi Province, which has coalfields in 50 of its 92 counties, are privately or cooperatively run small kilns.

　　These small kilns are typically operated in the spring and winter and closed in the summer and fall. The workers are also mostly seasonal.

　　In terms of management, there is a lack of long-term planning, with the sole aim of making money. Coal is extracted wherever it is found, regardless of safety. In addition, there is a lack of technical guidance (although some kilns have so-called "technicians," these "technicians" also rarely go down the mine). Accidents causing injuries and deaths occur frequently. For example, in Luoyukou, Yangqu, a collapse buried twelve workers in the coal tunnel. The ventilation equipment in the Houguan pit of the Jiu Yuan Gou in Xishan, Taiyuan is poor, and even a match cannot be lit inside the kiln. Due to chaotic mining in the Yitang Chengyi Kiln, the kiln collapsed, causing fifty workers to lose their jobs, and the country's excellent coalfields also suffered serious damage.

　　In terms of management, these small kiln owners still use feudal methods of exploitation to treat workers. Beating and scolding workers, extending working hours, increasing labor intensity, deducting and delaying wages, illegal dismissals, and super-economic exploitation are common occurrences. In the sixteen small kilns in Xishan, Taiyuan, a "big shift system" is still in place, with working hours as long as twenty-one hours. The phenomenon of wage arrears is also very serious, with some owing wages for two months, the most owing workers 25,000 jin of rice, and the least owing 5,000 jin of rice. In addition to exploiting workers in production, they also exploit them by selling rice, flour, and steamed buns. For example, the Jinmin kiln owner sells lamp oil to workers at a price of half a jin of rice per two liang, which is 40% higher than the market price. In addition, the capitalists use the threat of work stoppages to achieve their cruel exploitation of workers, and the Yitang kiln owner has had six work stoppages. As for the phenomenon of arbitrarily beating and scolding workers, it is even more common.

　　Small kiln workers still have no guarantee for their birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, or disability. For example, the Zifanggou kiln only gives injured workers two jin of rice a day and nothing else; some kilns do not even give half a jin of rice, and medical expenses are out of the question. After liberation, small kiln workers still live an inhuman life.

　　The mining methods are extremely backward and unsafe. Because the roadways are too low, underground transportation often requires crawling. Most of the mines are inclined shafts with angles ranging from forty to fifty degrees, and the steps are too narrow, allowing only half a foot to be placed. If one accidentally loses their footing, they will fall and be crushed along with the coal. At the same time, the employment of child labor under the age of fifteen is still a very common phenomenon in small kilns.

　　Although the Shanxi Provincial Government has done a lot of work in managing private coal kilns, it is still not enough. To date, most small kilns have not been registered with the government, and there is no question of enterprise management or democratic management.

　　Editor's Note: The feudal and backward phenomena existing in private small kilns in Shanxi Province should attract the attention of relevant departments.

　　We suggest that the Shanxi Provincial Government conduct strict inspections based on the spirit of the "Provisional Management Measures for Public and Private Coal Mines," "Provisional Handling Measures for Earth Kiln Coal Mines," and "Key Points for Safety Production Management of Public and Private Coal Mines" drafted and promulgated by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry on December 1 last year, eliminate unreasonable phenomena, and conscientiously implement the laws and regulations stipulated by the Central People's Government. Local trade unions and labor bureaus should also appropriately improve the working conditions of child labor and protect their health according to the specific situation.

### 山西省私营小窑封建剥削制度亟待废除

　　山西省私营小窑封建剥削制度亟待废除编辑同志：
    山西全省九十二个县有五十个县有煤田。全省共有三、○一七个井口，其中百分之八十以上是私营及合作经营的小窑。
    这些小窑的特点是多在春冬两季生产，夏秋歇业；工人也多是季节性的工人。
    在经营上缺乏长期建设观点，只图赚钱。见煤就采，不管安全；再加缺乏技术指导（有些窑虽有所谓“技术人员”，这些“技术人员”也是经常不下井），伤亡事故接连发生。比如：阳曲罗峪口一次塌陷，十二个工人被压在煤洞中。太原西山九院沟后关坑下通风设备不良，窑内连火柴都燃不着。义棠成义窑由于乱开采的结果，将窑挖塌，五十个工人因而失业，祖国良好的煤田，也遭受着严重的破坏。
    在管理上，这些小窑窑主仍然沿用着封建的剥削方法，来对待工人。打骂工人，延长工时，增加劳动强度，克扣及拖欠工资，非法解雇，及超经济的剥削等是屡见不鲜的事。在太原西山十六座小窑中，还实行着“大班制”，工作时间有长达二十一小时者。拖欠工资的现象也非常严重，有两个月没发工资的，最多的欠工人工资二五、○○○斤米，最少的也欠五、○○○斤米。除从生产上剥削工人外，还以卖米、面、蒸馍来进行剥削。如晋民窑主卖给工人灯油，每两合半斤米，高于市价百分之四十。此外，资方并利用停工的威胁来达到其残酷剥削工人的目的，义棠窑主就发生过六次停工事件。至于随便打骂工人的现象，更是普遍。
    小窑工人的生、老、病、死、伤、残至今没有一点保障。如子房沟窑对公伤工人，除每天给二斤米外啥也不管；有的窑甚至连半斤米也不给，医药费根本谈不上。解放后的小窑工人，仍过着非人的生活。
    在采煤方法上，是极端落后，极不安全。因巷道太低，井下运输往往是匍匐前进。井多半是四十至五十度不等的斜井，台阶过窄，只能踏半只脚，如不慎失足，连人带煤一块跌下去，就跌得粉碎。同时小窑雇用十五岁以下的童工，还是很普遍的现象。
    山西省政府对私营煤窑的管理虽作了不少工作，但仍是不够。至今大部小窑还没经政府备案，根本谈不到企业化的经营，民主化的管理。
                                                读者  段宏源
    编者按：山西省私营小窑所存在的封建落后现象，应引起有关部门的重视。
    我们建议山西省政府应根据中央燃料工业部于去年十二月一日，颁发的《公私营煤矿暂行管理办法》、《土窑煤矿暂行处理办法》、《公私营煤矿安全生产管理要点》等草案的精神，进行严格检查，取消不合理的现象，认真执行中央人民政府规定的法令。当地工会及劳动局并应根据具体情况，适当改善童工的劳动条件，保护童工健康。
