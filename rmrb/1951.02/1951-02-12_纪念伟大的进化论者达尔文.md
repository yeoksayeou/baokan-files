　　Commemorating the Great Evolutionist Darwin
　　Zhou Jianren
    Charles Darwin (hereinafter referred to as Darwin) was born on February 12, 1809, in Shrewsbury, England. He devoted his life to natural science and wrote many books. Besides travelogues, autobiographies, and other articles, his works include: *On the Origin of Species* (first edition, November 24, 1859), *On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects* (1862), *The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication* (1868), *The Descent of Man* (1871), *The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals* (1872), *Insectivorous Plants* (1875), *The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants* (1875), *The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom* (1876), *The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species* (1877), *The Power of Movement in Plants* (1880), *The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms* (1881).

    Before Darwin, although some individuals had published articles (works) on evolution, such as Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck, they were not opposed by opponents with the same animosity as Darwin was. At the same time, the idea of individual creation of species, the so-called "special creation" theory, had not been completely shattered and still retained considerable influence and remained in the minds of many people. It was not until the publication of Darwin's *On the Origin of Species* that this anti-scientific idea was completely smashed. When this work was published, the founders of Marxism immediately welcomed it, and young people supported it. Only some backward people and those in religious circles felt fear and opposed it with all their might. This was because Darwin's work was particularly substantial, giving a powerful blow to the metaphysical worldview. Engels mentioned this situation in *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*.

    In *On the Origin of Species*, Darwin used powerful language to directly and vigorously attack the "special creation" theory. By correctly placing biological science on a scientific basis, he left no room for non-scientific worldviews. He explained that there is a close relationship between organisms; the rise and fall of one organism can affect other organisms; the relationship between them is like a net, pulling one thread affects the whole. He also explained that within an individual, various parts are also closely related, for example, animals with long legs often have long heads. This relationship is called correlation. What seemed particularly important at the time was that he used abundant materials and repeated discussions to clarify that various organisms were not created individually, but evolved from common ancestors. Even what the world often calls amazing, such as the instinct of bees to build nests, was discussed. He cited other types of bees similar to honeybees that can build very simple nests, clarifying that this ingenious nest-building instinct also evolved gradually. He discussed the distribution of fossils found in rocks and the geographical distribution of organisms, strengthening the "theory of descent," which is the opposite of the "special creation" theory. It explains that various organisms have origins. It explains that various organisms are the products of history, and this is Darwin's great achievement.

    However, in *On the Origin of Species*, Darwin only explained the general principles of biological evolution and did not discuss the origin of a specific organism in detail. Regarding the fact that humans evolved from animals, namely apes, although he had thought about it very "maturely," he only mentioned a few words in the concluding chapter, saying that for the future, he had seen more important and broader paths for exploration, that human intelligence is gradually acquired, and this will inevitably provide many explanations for the origin and history of humans. Some people who narrate Darwin's life events believe that at this time, Darwin was already very clear about the origin of humans, but because he was a prudent fighter, he was afraid that the time was not right, and immediately saying it would be detrimental to promoting the theory of evolution ( *The Descent of Man* was published twelve years later). However, once he placed biological science on a truly scientific basis, he gave a severe blow to the superstition of God creating all things and creating humans. The opposition, with terrified hearts, shouted the slogan "Save souls, overthrow evolution," but it was completely useless. Victory ultimately belonged to the side of science. Darwin, based on a historical perspective, gave a scientific explanation of the origin of organisms, breaking the metaphysical worldview. This achievement is great. Therefore, the founders of Marxism gave his theory a very high evaluation. When Engels delivered a speech at Marx's tomb, he said, "Just as Darwin discovered the law of development of the organic world, Marx discovered the law of development of human history." Engels praised him for "discovering the law of development of the organic world." Modern authors generally associate the theory of evolution (biological evolution) with Darwin's name, and there is a reason for this. The opposition shouting "Overthrow evolution" refers to Darwin's theory of evolution. They also acknowledge that the scientific theory of evolution was pioneered by Darwin.

    The importance and greatness of Darwin's theory of evolution have been explained above, but at the same time, it must be pointed out that his theory is not entirely correct and contains shortcomings and errors. First, his theory mixed in the ideas of Malthus' *Essay on the Principle of Population*. According to Darwin himself, "In August 1838, after fifteen months of systematic research, I happened to pick up *Population* to read as a pastime..." However, as a result, he was influenced by it and introduced the concept of "struggle for existence" into his book *On the Origin of Species*. He said: Organisms reproduce excessively, and the struggle for existence is inevitable. However, Darwin himself seemed to feel that this was not very appropriate at the time, so he began by stating: "I use this term in a broad and metaphorical sense, including the dependence of one organism on another, and more importantly (this is the most important), not only the survival of the individual, but also the success of leaving offspring." But his thinking influenced by *Essay on the Principle of Population* was often used by imperialists or the big bourgeoisie.

    Second, is the denial of mutations in the biological world. Darwin firmly believed that "nature makes no leaps." This was mentioned several times in *On the Origin of Species*. He believed that organisms change gradually. As everyone knows, gradual change without mutation certainly exists, such as language as pointed out by Stalin, but the variations of organisms do have mutations, as explained by Lysenko recently. We can also say that some mutations, such as crossing from A to B, may go through a process similar to gradual change, but when essential differences occur after this process, it becomes a mutation. But Darwin regarded all as gradual change.

    The idea that humans evolved from apes is a major event in science. It is naturally particularly noticeable in Christian countries. One can see this by looking at the actions of Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford, England, famous for his keen sophistry, who presided over the British Association for the Advancement of Science and wanted to defeat Darwin. Wilberforce was a person who completely did not understand science. He knew he was incapable and is said to have invited some women to help him. After he babbled for a while, Darwin himself was not present, and only his believer Huxley answered a few sentences. As a result, Wilberforce was defeated miserably, and Mrs. Brewster fainted, ending in this way.

    Speaking of Darwin's theory of human origin, it also has shortcomings. He neglected the role of the labor process of human ancestors in creating true humans. If this point is not mentioned, how humans could have differentiated from apes cannot be fully explained. This extremely important process was detailed in Engels' immortal essay *The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man*.

    Darwin's theory has been given the name Darwinism by later generations. Subsequently, so-called neo-Darwinism appeared, with the German Weismann as the representative of this school. However, he did not supplement or develop Darwin's theory, but only distorted it. Before long, people knew that so-called neo-Darwinism was actually anti-Darwinism.

    In fact, what enriched, developed, and corrected Darwin's theory was not neo-Darwinism, but the Soviet Union's Michurin and Lysenko's *Creative Darwinism*. The work of Michurin and Lysenko cleared away Weismann's doctrine of the continuity of the germ plasm, eliminated Morgan's theory of heredity related to Weismann's "doctrine," and discarded Darwin's errors, supplementing or correcting the shortcomings of Darwin's theory.

    Here, a point can be mentioned to illustrate. The premise of Darwin's explanation that new species can arise from old species lies in determining that every kind of organism is capable of change, that is, organisms have variability. But what kind of nature is the variability of organisms, or how does variability arise? Darwin believed that living conditions could cause organisms to change, or in other words, variations are acquired from life. As for the question of how the nature of this change can be inherited by the next generation when living conditions affect the individual organism and the organism changes, Darwin had a hypothesis: He imagined that each cell of the organism could produce a subtle substance invisible to the naked eye, which could divide and multiply, scatter outside the produced cell, and travel to other parts of the body. Finally, they travel to the reproductive cells and gather in these cells. Through the action of these invisible micro-points traveling in various parts of the body, the effect of external influences can be transmitted to the reproductive cells, and when these reproductive cells develop into new individuals, they inherit the nature of the change to the next generation. Darwin wrote this hypothesis in his *The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication*. Darwin's hypothesis is different from Morgan's theory of heredity. But he only said that there is a close relationship between the individual organism and living conditions, but he did not explain exactly how the relationship is. Lysenko explained it in detail.

    Lysenko believes that the organism and the environment (living conditions) are a unity. Everything that the organism needs is taken from the outside world. When these substances are in the outside world, they are external things. Once they are ingested into the organism and assimilated into the substances that make up the organism, they become internal things. (After the internal things decompose, such as being excreted from the body, they become external things again. The process of organisms absorbing substances, forming the body, and decomposing and excreting is called metabolism.) As for which substances a certain organism needs to ingest and what degree of light, heat, etc. is needed, they are all different. This is because various organisms have various different types of metabolism. If the environment changes, the type of metabolism of the organism will change accordingly within a certain range. The nature of the organism will also change.

    Chairman Mao once said in the report on rectifying the style of study, the style of the Party, and the style of writing: "From ancient times to the present, there are only two types of knowledge in the world: one is called the knowledge of the struggle for production; the other is called the knowledge of class struggle, and national struggle is also included in it." The knowledge of natural science (biology is one of its departments) belongs to the knowledge of the struggle for production. Darwin's hypothesis intends to explain that the changes caused by living conditions to the organism can be inherited by later generations. However, when breeders select seeds, they still need to carefully select the already occurred variations of individuals, cultivate them, and develop the desired traits. Lysenko discovered that various types of metabolism (that is, the heredity of various organisms) can change with living conditions. Therefore, as long as living conditions are changed, the nature of organisms can be transformed. Truth is useful. By mastering this natural scientific truth, one can control a part of nature, that is, the variability of organisms, and be able to transform species. Lysenko has used this natural scientific knowledge to increase agricultural production. Scientific truth is not decoration, not fantasy, but a sharp weapon. People who master it can overcome difficulties and defeat stubborn enemies.

　　纪念伟大的进化论者达尔文
　　周建人
    查理士·达尔文（以下单称达尔文）生于一八零九年二月十二日的英国士鲁兹巴利。他一生做着自然科学的工作，写了不少书。除却游记、自传及其他文章外，他的著作还有：《物种的起源》（一八五九年十一月二十四日初版），《阿吉司兰花的虫媒受精法》（一八六二年），《培养下的动植物的变异》（一八六八年），《人的由来》（一八七一年），《人及动物的表情》（一八七二年），《食虫植物》（一八七五年），《攀缘植物的运动及习性》（一八七五年），《自花受精及他花受精的效果》（一八七六年），《同种植物上各异的花》（一八七七年），《植物的运动能力》（一八八○年），《经过曲蟮的活动，植物壤土的形成》（一八八一年）。
    达尔文以前，虽然已有若干人发表过进化论的文章（著作），如蒲封，依拉司慕司·达尔文，拉马克等等。但是他们没有被反对派像仇视达尔文的仇视；同时，物种个别创造出来的所谓“特创说”的思想也还没有被完全击破，它还有相当的势力，还残留在不少人的思想里。直到达尔文的《物种的起源》出版后，才把这种反科学的思想打得粉碎。当这著作出版的时候，马克思主义的创立者立刻表示欢迎，青年人亦表示拥护，只有若干落后的及宗教界的人们则觉得恐惧，反对不遗余力。这是因为达尔文的这著作，内容特别充实，给了形而上学的世界观以有力的打击的原故。这一情形，恩格斯在《社会主义从空想到科学》里便曾讲到的。
    达尔文在《物种的起源》里用有力的辞句，正面地竭力打击了《特创说》，而且由于他把生物科学正确地放置在科学的基础上，这就使得非科学的世界观无地容纳。他说明生物之间有密切的联系；一种生物的盛衰变化能影响到别种的生物；其间的关系犹如一张网，拉动一线，牵动全部。他又说明个体里，各部分也是大有关系的，例如腿长的动物常有长头，这种关系，称之为相关作用。在当时看起来尤其重要的是：他用丰富的材料与反复的讨论，阐明各种生物都不是个别创造出来，是从有种祖先变化过来的。便是世人常常称为很可惊奇的，如蜜蜂造窠的本能，也加以讨论。他举出与蜜蜂同类的别种蜂，它们能造很简单的窠，阐明这种巧妙的造窠本能，也是逐步进化而来。他讨论了留存在岩石中的化石的分布与生物的地理分布，加强了《由来说》，《由来说》是与《特创说》相反对的学说，它说明各种生物都有由来。说明各种生物都是历史的产物，这是达尔文的大功绩。
    但达尔文在《物种的起源》里只说明了生物进化的一般的道理，没有详细讨论某一种生物的起源。对于人种由动物即猿猴类进化而来的事实，他虽然已想得很“成熟”，却只在末章结论里说到几句，说对于未来，他已看到有更重要的供探究的广大道路，人的智能是逐渐获得的，这对于人的起源及人的历史方面必能给予很多的阐明。有的传述达尔文的生平事迹的人，认为这时候达尔文对于人种由来，实已很明了，只因他是一个稳健的战斗者，恐时候不到，立即说出来，反于推行进化说不利云云（《人类的由来》十二年后才出版）。但是他把生物科学一旦安放在真正科学的基础上，就给予上帝造万物与造人的迷信一个严重的打击。反对派怀着恐怖的心情，呼出“拯救心灵，打倒进化论”的口号，但完全没有用处，胜利终究属于科学这方面。达尔文根据历史的看法，把生物的来源给予科学的说明，打破形而上学的宇宙观，这一功绩是很大的。因此马克思主义的创始人给他的学说很高的评价。恩格斯在马克思的墓前发表演说时，有“像达尔文发现了生物界的发展法则一样，马克思发现了人类的发展法则”的话。恩格斯表扬他“发见生物界的发展法则”的荣誉。近代的作者们，说起进化论（生物进化论），一般与达尔文之名相连结，是有理由的。反对派喊“打倒进化论”，便是指达尔文的进化论，他们也承认科学的进化论为达尔文所首创。
    前面已说明达尔文的进化说的重要与伟大，但同时必须指出：他的学说并不是全部正确，又包含着缺点与错误。第一，他的学说里混进了马尔萨斯《人口论》的思想。据达尔文自己所说，“一八三八年的八月间，开始作系统地研究十五个月后，我偶尔拿《人口论》来读着玩，……”结果却受了它的影响，把“生存斗争”的概念引导进他的《物种起源》这书里。他说：生物的生殖过繁，生存斗争不可免。可是达尔文自己当时似乎也感觉到不大妥当，所以他开始便声明道：“我把这名辞是作广义与比喻的意思用的，包括一种生物依靠他种生物，更包括（这是最重要的）不只是个体的存活，并留下的子孙的成功。”但是他受《人口论》的影响的思想，终于常被帝国主义者或大资产阶级所利用。
    第二，是生物界中突变的被否认。达尔文深信“自然界中无飞跃”。《物种的起源》里曾说到数次。他认为生物是逐渐变化的。大家知道：渐变而无突变的事情固然也有，例如斯大林所指出的语言，但生物的变异却实有突变，如最近李森科所说明。我们又可以说：有些突变，如从甲渡过到乙，中间会经过近似于渐变的过程，可是经过这一过程后，发生本质上的不同时，就成了突变。但达尔文则一概看作渐变了。
    说人类从猿猴类进化来的这一件事，在科学上是一件大事情。在信基督教的国家自然是特别引人注意的。只要看了英国牛津的以灵敏狡辩著名的主教威伯福士主持英国科学促进会，想打倒达尔文这一行动便可以知道。威伯福士是一个完全不懂科学的人，他自知无能，传说邀了若干女人去助威。他自己胡说了一通之后，达尔文自己没有到场，只由他的信者赫胥黎回答了几句，结果威伯福士惨败，部卢师脱太太昏倒，这样下场。
    讲到达尔文的人种由来说，也是有缺点的，他忽略了人类远祖的劳动过程对于造成真正人类的作用。如果不提到这一点，人类如何能从猿类分化出来是不可能充分说明的。这一段极重要的过程，恩格斯的不朽的论文《在从猿到人的转变中，劳动所起的作用》里曾详细地指明了。
    达尔文的学说，后人曾给予达尔文主义的称号。接着，有所谓新达尔文主义出现，德国的维斯曼是这一派的代表；但他没有把达尔文学说补充或发展，只有把它歪曲；没有多少时候，人们便知道所谓新达尔文主义，实际上是反达尔文主义的。
    实际上使达尔文学说丰富，发展，与订正的不是新达尔文主义，而是苏联的米邱林、李森科的《创造性的达尔文主义》。米邱林与李森科的劳作，扫清了新达尔文主义者维斯曼所坚持的种质一系连续的学说，肃清了与维斯曼《学说》相关连的摩尔根的遗传说，并且摒弃了达尔文的错误，补足或订正了达尔文学说的缺点。
    这里可以提一点来加以说明。达尔文说明新种能够从旧种产生的前提，在于确定每种生物都能够变化，即生物具有变异性。但是生物的变异性究竟是怎样的性质，或怎样产生变异的呢？达尔文是相信生活条件能使生物发生变化的，或者说从生活中获得变异。至于生活条件影响到生物个体，生物体发生了变化，如何能使这变化的性质遗传于下一代的一问题，达尔文曾有过一个假设：他设想生物体的各个细胞能产生出一种目不能见的微细的物质，能分裂增多，散出产生的细胞之外，游行到身体的别部分。最后游行到生殖细胞里，遂汇集在这细胞之中。经过这种看不见的微点能游行于身体各部的作用，能将外界的影响的效果传达到生殖细胞中间，这生殖细胞发育为新的个体时，遂把变化的性质遗传于后一代了。达尔文把这假设写在他的《家养下的动植物的变异》里。达尔文的这一假设，与摩尔根的遗传说是不同的。但他只说到生物个体与生活条件有密切的关系，至于关系究竟如何，并没有说明。李森科却详细说明了。
    李森科认为生物体与环境（生活条件）是统一体，生物体所需要的一切物质无不取自外界，当这些物质在外界之时，是为外在之物，一旦摄取进生物体内，同化为构成生物体的物质时，便成为内在之物了。（内在之物分解后，如又排泄体外，则又成为外在之物。生物吸收物质，构成体质，与分解排出，称为代谢作用。）至于某一种生物需要摄取哪些物质及需要何等程度的光线、热度等则各种不同。因为各种生物有各种不同的代谢作用型之故。如果环境发生变化，在一定程度内，生物的代谢作用型会跟着发生变化。生物体的性质也就发生变化。
    毛主席在整顿学风党风文风的报告里曾经说过：“从古至今世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识；一门叫做阶级斗争知识，民族斗争知识也包括在里面。”自然科学的知识（生物学是其中的一部门）是属于生产斗争知识。达尔文的假设，意图说明生物体因生活条件所起的变化能遗传于后代，但是育种家选种的时候，还是需要细心地选择个体的已发生的变异，把它培养起来，使所需要的性质发展。李森科发见各种代谢作用型（即各种生物的遗传性），能随生活条件变化，因此只要变更生活条件，就能改造生物的性质。真理是有用处的，掌握了这一自然科学的真理，便能控制自然的一部分，即生物的变异性，能够改造物种了。李森科曾运用这种自然科学知识增加了农业生产品。科学真理不是装饰，不是空想，是犀利的武器，人们掌握了它，可以克服困难，战胜顽敌。
