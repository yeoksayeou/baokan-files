　　Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Korea, February 12th: A front-line reporter for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army reported on February 11th that the US, British, Turkish and other invading forces, along with the Li Seung-man bandit army, concentrated more than 200,000 of their main forces and have been frantically attacking our positions south of Seoul on the Han River and along the lines of Chipyeong-ri and Sangrong-bong (30 li northwest of Hoengseong) since January 25th. After 18 days and nights of heroic and tenacious resistance by our army, enemy corpses litter the fields, and they have suffered heavy casualties, resulting in exceptionally slow progress. At present, the basic positions on the south bank of the Han River are still in our hands, standing firm and unmoved. The morale of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army is growing stronger with each battle, and they are preparing for a full-scale counteroffensive to completely shatter the enemy's foolish invasion.

    【新华社朝鲜北部某地十二日电】中国人民志愿军前线记者二月十一日报道称：美、英、土等侵略军及李承晚匪军，集中其主力二十余万，自一月二十五日起至今日止，向我汉城江南及砥平里、上荣峰（横城西北三十里）线阵地疯狂进犯。经我军十八昼夜的英勇顽强抗击，敌军横尸遍野，伤亡惨重，其进展异常缓慢。现汉江南岸基本阵地仍在我手，屹然未动。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军士气愈抗愈盛，正准备全线反攻，彻底粉碎敌人的愚蠢进犯。
