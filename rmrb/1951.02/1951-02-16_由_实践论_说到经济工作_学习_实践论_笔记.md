　　From "On Practice" to Economic Work
　  ——Notes on Studying "On Practice"
　　Wang Xuewen
            (1)
    New Democratic economic construction is the practice of economic work in the People's Republic of China. This practice is carried out under the leadership of Mao Zedong's economic thought. Mao Zedong's economic thought is Marxist-Leninist economic thought, is the Sinicized Marxist-Leninist economic thought, is the thought that combines Marxist-Leninist economic thought with China's economic reality to lead China's New Democratic economic construction.
    Marxist theory is the theory formed when the modern proletariat, accompanied by the tremendous productive force of large-scale industry, transformed from a class in itself into a class for itself. It is a scientific summary of various revolutionary struggles, a truth discovered through practice, and verified and developed through practice. With the development of revolutionary struggles, Marxism developed into Leninism, and Marxist-Leninist theory continued to develop with the development of various revolutionary struggles. Due to the development of the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people, there was a need for theoretical weapons and the ability to master theoretical weapons. This theory is a theory that "applies to all corners of the world," and therefore is applicable to the practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist economic thought is also applicable to China's New Democratic economic construction in the process of Chinese revolutionary practice.
    This is the specific application of Marxist-Leninist economic thought to China's revolutionary construction, and it is also the development of Marxist-Leninist economic thought, and one of the important achievements in the process of the Chinese revolutionary movement. We know that China's New Democratic economic construction is closely and inseparably linked to the Sinicization of Marxist-Leninist economic thought. In the continuous interaction between the practice of China's New Democratic economic construction and the Sinicized Marxist-Leninist economic thought over many years (theory becomes practice, and practice produces theory), it is constantly moving forward (theory promotes practice, improves practice, and practice improves and develops theory) and is closely unified (the process of close integration and unity between theory and practice). This proves the correctness and development of the Sinicized Marxist-Leninist economic thought, and proves that the practice of New Democratic economic construction is a practice under the leadership of scientific economic thought, which can be developed and achieve significant results. Therefore, the practice and guiding thought of New Democratic economic construction, especially the guiding economic thought, are inseparable from Comrade Mao Zedong's correct thought and brilliant leadership.
            (2)
    Comrade Mao Zedong's economic thought has its philosophical theoretical basis, namely dialectical materialism and historical materialism. "On Practice" is Comrade Mao Zedong's systematic written expression of the epistemological theory of dialectical materialism.
    In "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong first tells us that "production activity is the most basic practical activity, and it is the thing that determines all other activities. Man's knowledge mainly depends on material production activity, gradually understanding natural phenomena, the nature of nature, the laws of nature, the relationship between man and nature; and through production activity, he also gradually understands, to varying degrees, the certain interrelationships between people."
    According to this instruction, our economic workers and economic theory workers must recognize the importance of production and regard production as the basic part of economic work. All economic work should be based on and centered on production, serve the general policy of developing production, and implement the general policy of developing production into the work of our own departments. Economic work departments other than production are not unrelated to production, nor can they be unrelated, but need to have close links with production in their work, coordinating with production to promote production. Only when the basic work of production is done well can other economic work have a foundation. At the same time, when other economic work coordinates with production to promote production, it can enable production to proceed smoothly and develop effectively, and do a good job in its own department. "Production activity is the most basic practical activity, and it is the thing that determines all other activities." This basic principle exists objectively and functions in the economic work process, regardless of whether we recognize it or how well we recognize it. Only when our economic workers correctly and deeply understand this basic principle and consciously apply it to actual work can we do a good job in economic work.
    Therefore, the standard for judging the quality of economic work is, in the production sector, to see whether it can play the role of "the most basic practical activity, determining all other activities" in economic work, and whether other economic departments can play the role of coordinating with production to promote production and develop production for the production sector. Therefore, it can also be judged how well economic workers understand, grasp, and apply this basic principle.
    Production, as Comrade Stalin said, has two aspects, two necessary factors: one is the productive forces, that is, "the relationship of people to objects and the forces of nature" ("these objects and forces of nature are used to produce material materials"); the other is the relations of production, that is, "the relations of people to each other in the production process." Production is also "the embodiment of the unity of productive forces and relations of production in the process of material production" (History of the CPSU(B), Chapter 4, Section 2). Simply put, production is composed of two necessary factors, productive forces and relations of production, and is also the movement of the combination and unity of these two necessary factors.
    Our economic workers, especially production workers, must recognize the relationship between people and nature in production, in the production process, its nature and laws, and at the same time, they must recognize the relationship between people in production, in the production process, its nature and laws. Only by understanding production from the combined and unified movement of the two necessary factors of production can we specifically and deeply understand it. The correctness and depth of our understanding and mastery of this aspect become the standard for judging the quality of our understanding and work.
            (3)
    Comrade Mao Zedong tells us that practice is the basic source of our knowledge, formation, and development, "A person's knowledge is nothing more than two parts: direct knowledge and indirect experience." According to this instruction, our economic workers cannot be satisfied with their own work experience, let alone satisfied with book knowledge. They must accumulate more experience in their own work (this is important), and must absorb and accept the experience of others; they should not only pay attention to the experience of one period, but also need long-term experience; not only current experience, but also past experience; not only pay attention to the experience of one department and one region, but also pay attention to the experience of other departments and other regions; not only the experience of China, but also the experience of foreign countries; not only pay attention to successful experience, but also pay attention to the lessons of failure. Only in this way can we enrich ourselves and enrich ourselves in work experience.
    Comrade Mao Zedong also tells us that not all empirical knowledge is reliable. We "in the process of practice, at the beginning only see the phenomena of various things in the process, see the one-sidedness of various things, and see the external connections between various things." This belongs to perceptual knowledge. We must also "from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge" in order to understand "the whole, essential, and internal connections of things."
    According to this instruction, our economic workers should not be satisfied with their own perceptual knowledge at work, and should know that perceptual knowledge is only a low-level stage of understanding, and only a one-sided understanding of the expression phenomenon. We must always pay attention to grasping and applying materialist dialectics and Marxist-Leninist economic theory to summarize our economic work experience. Attention should be paid to the process and results of economic work resolutions, decisions, instructions, work plans, arrangements, and execution. The results of practice should become one of the important items in the work summary, and the standard for judging the quality of the work. We can concentrate, accumulate, and scientifically summarize work experience, "discard the dross and select the essence, eliminate the false and retain the true, proceed from this to that, and from the outside to the inside," we can more correctly, thoroughly, and deeply understand our practice, distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, supplement our work deficiencies, and revise our work errors. Of course, it is not easy to comprehensively and essentially recognize complex, intricate, and ever-changing financial and economic phenomena in internal connections, nor can it be achieved by all economic workers in a short period of time. Especially since the nationwide construction of New Democratic economy has only just begun, its development depends on future work promotion and work progress. It is of course difficult, and even impossible, for us to immediately recognize the overall situation of the practice of New Democratic economic construction now (not only to see the phenomenon but also to see the essence, not only to see the external connection, but also to see the internal connection and laws). However, comprehensive, essential, and internal connection to understand the economic work practice is the requirement of the senior leaders for our economic work practice, we must work towards this direction, in order to avoid the mistake of looking at problems and handling problems superficially and one-sidedly.
    New Democratic economic theory, like other Marxist-Leninist theories, comes from practice and must return to practice. By summarizing certain economic laws from the long-term and large-scale practice of New Democratic economic construction, we can further and more comprehensively understand certain economic work practices.
    In our future practice, we can use these economic laws and handle them according to these economic laws, which will make it easier to promote the practice of our economic work.
    Economic laws objectively exist in economic phenomena and play their due role in economic phenomena. These economic laws can be recognized by us. The result of the recognition of these objective economic laws forms a certain economic principle. However, its recognition requires certain conditions and a certain process. In the process of work practice, when the objective conditions are not yet mature and the subjective understanding has not yet been improved, when we cannot recognize certain economic laws, we will be blindly subject to the control of certain economic laws, and may blindly play a certain neutralizing, obstructive, or even destructive role in economic work. The magnitude and depth of its neutralization, obstruction, and destructive effect depends on the size and depth of the scope of our economic work practice that violates them. When the objective conditions are quite mature and we have reached the point where we can recognize certain economic laws, we can consciously and plannedly use and control these economic laws to serve the economic work of the New Democracy within this scope, and prevent its blind neutralization, obstruction, and destructive effects. The more comprehensive and profound our understanding of the economic work situation and economic laws, the more we can strengthen the leadership and control of economic work when we apply these economic laws in practice, the greater our struggle against economic spontaneity, blindness, and other obstacles, and our practice can proceed more smoothly and effectively according to the plan and achieve results.
            (4)
    Comrade Mao Zedong tells us, "The practice of objective process," "due to internal contradictions and struggles, are moving forward and developing forward, and people's cognitive movement should also follow the movement and development." According to this instruction, our economic workers must recognize that when the New Democratic economy advances from a lower stage to a higher stage, work must be carried out in response to changes in the specific economic work practice.
    When we are in a war and rural divided environment, we need to grasp the characteristics and movement laws of the wartime rural economy. When we enter the cities from the countryside and are in a time when the war is basically over, we need to grasp the current national economic situation, characteristics, and movement laws. Not only must we grasp the laws of agricultural economic movement, but also the laws of urban economic movement, and pay attention to the laws of urban and rural material exchange and domestic and foreign material exchange, as well as the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests, and both labor and capital.
    When we are in the countryside, there are state-owned economies, cooperative economies, and individual economies, mainly self-sufficient economies. Although there is a commodity economy, it is not very developed. Now that we have entered the cities, there is a more developed commodity economy and other economies centered on and based on it.
    Through our practice, some of these economies have changed the relations of production and also changed the nature of the economy; some new relations of production and new economies have been established; some economies have declined (unfavorable to the national economy and people's livelihood). The above three types of economies have also changed, added new content, and there are also state capitalism and private capitalism economies. Because of the change in the relations of production, the economic structure has also changed, and the general laws of economic movement are completely different from the general laws of economic movement in the old China dominated by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Although there are still some common points between the current New Democratic economy and the old Chinese economy, such as the existence of rural self-sufficient economies and the relatively developed urban commodity economy, the important thing is not these common points, but the particularity of these economies and the differences in the general laws of economic movement. The New Democratic economy is not only completely different from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy, but the higher stage of the New Democratic economy is also different from the lower stage, so its economic movement laws are also different.
    The characteristic of New Democratic economic theory lies in recognizing the characteristics of these economies and the special laws of economic movement. In our practice, we need to formulate methods in response to the characteristics of these economies, and consciously apply the special laws of these economies. We must recognize that the New Democratic economy is an economy that transitions to the socialist economy, and the laws of New Democratic economic movement are different from the laws of socialist economic movement. In the New Democratic economy, we must also recognize that the five types of economy each have their own characteristics of movement laws. These five economic forms and their movement laws with their own characteristics interact with each other and influence each other to form the general trend and general law of the current stage of New Democratic economic movement. If we can more correctly, thoroughly, and deeply recognize and grasp the various economic conditions, movement laws, and development trends and general laws of the New Democracy, we can carry out our economic work more freely, and therefore more smoothly and effectively, in the practice process.
    Every process of the New Democratic economy moving from a lower stage to a higher stage requires us to grasp the overall economic situation and its movement laws, gradually strengthen the leadership of the state-owned economy over other economies, strengthen the planning of the New Democratic economy, improve the productivity of New China, move from an agricultural country to an industrial country (the industrialization of the New China economy), and strengthen and consolidate the construction of national defense, industry, transportation, and other aspects.
    This requires us to actively engage in the practice of economic work, and at the same time, with the progress of New Democratic economic construction, improve our understanding of the practice of economic work. We must pay attention to the fact that not only should economic thought not lag behind the practice of economic work, but also our economic work thought must play a promoting and leading role in the process of work practice. Because our New Democratic economy is a planned economy, and with the progress of New Democratic economic construction, this planning will not only not weaken, but will also be strengthened. The planned economy, and the economy that needs to be strengthened, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, cannot lead to its goals if it "cannot see the whole of the objective process, lacks a clear direction, and has no grand future." On the contrary, only by seeing the whole of the various economic processes of the New Democracy, grasping the clear economic work guidelines, using economic forces and economic laws, and carrying out work in a planned and step-by-step manner toward a grand future can we effectively shoulder the responsibility of leadership. Of course, our various levels of economic workers cannot completely push this responsibility to the senior leadership, and they must also have this understanding and share part of the responsibility. Only in this way can our economic guidelines and policies be correctly implemented.
            (5)
    Obviously, when it comes to the above issues, the study of theory becomes important. Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" is one of the best teaching materials for our theoretical study, giving us correct, profound, and valuable guidance in epistemology and methodology. This is the basic theory of social science, and also the basic viewpoints and methods related to all economic problems. Whether the basic viewpoints and methods are correct is the fundamental difference between Marxist-Leninist theory and non-Marxist-Leninist so-called "theory," and the fundamental distinction between science and non-science. Marxist-Leninist theory and non-Marxist-Leninist so-called "theory" not only have major differences in various issues, but also have fundamental differences in epistemology and methodology. As for the "left" and right opportunists who claim to be Marxists and Leninists, although they also use certain Marxist-Leninist words in various forms, their basic viewpoints and methods are non-Marxist-Leninist, so their entire argument is also wrong. That is to say, all wrong so-called theories are related to their basic viewpoints and methods. If the basic viewpoints and methods are wrong, all views based on these basic viewpoints and methods cannot be correct. The same is true for economic thought. If it is the viewpoint and method of the unity of subjective and objective, the unity of knowledge and practice, it is Marxist-Leninist and scientific. If it is the viewpoint and method of "the separation of subjective and objective, the separation of knowledge and practice," it is non-Marxist-Leninist and wrong.
    Mao Zedong's economic thought (or economic theory) is closely and inseparably linked and unified with its basic viewpoints and methods. Our study of "On Practice" is precisely to understand Mao Zedong Thought from the basic aspects, first of all, the economic thought related to our work.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" has scientific, correct, thorough, and profound thoughts, developmental and forward-looking viewpoints, and the revolutionary and fighting spirit of the Party, with valuable and rich content. If we study hard, delve deeply, and can grasp the spirit and essence of this work, and apply its viewpoints and methods to our work, it will have good results for promoting work and improving work efficiency.

　　由“实践论”说到经济工作
　  ——学习“实践论”笔记
　　王学文
            （一）
    新民主主义的经济建设，是中华人民共和国经济工作的实践。这种实践是在毛泽东经济思想领导之下进行的。毛泽东经济思想是马列主义的经济思想，是中国化的马列主义经济思想，是马列主义经济思想与中国经济实际情况相结合而领导中国新民主主义经济建设的思想。
    马克思主义的理论是伴随巨大生产力——大工业而出现的近代无产阶级由自在的阶级成为自为的阶级时形成的理论，是各种革命斗争经验的科学的总结，是通过实践而发现，又通过实践而证实与发展的真理。随着革命斗争的发展，马克思主义发展为列宁主义，并且马列主义的理论又随着各种革命斗争的发展而向前发展。由于中国工人阶级及广大人民的革命斗争的发展，需要理论武器并且能够掌握理论武器，这种理论是“放之四海而皆准”的理论，故能对于中国革命斗争的实践适用。因而马列主义的经济思想在中国革命实践过程中对于中国新民主主义经济建设也同样的适用。
    这是马列主义经济思想对中国革命建设的具体运用，同时也是马列主义经济思想的发展，并且是在中国革命运动过程中重要成果之一。我们知道，中国新民主主义经济建设与马列主义经济思想的中国化有密切不可分离的联系。在中国新民主主义经济建设的实践与中国化的马列主义经济思想长年间不断的交互作用过程中（理论变为实践，实践又产生理论），不断向前发展（理论推动实践提高实践，实践又提高发展理论）与密切统一过程（理论与实践密切结合密切统一过程）中，证明中国化的马列主义经济思想的正确与发展，并证明了新民主主义经济建设的实践，是科学的经济思想领导下的实践，能够得到发展和获得显著的成果。因此新民主主义经济建设的实践与领导思想，尤其是经济的领导思想，是与毛泽东同志的正确的思想和英明的领导不可分离的。
            （二）
    毛泽东同志的经济思想有它的哲学的理论基础，即辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。“实践论”就是毛泽东同志以有系统的文字表现出来的、辩证唯物论的认识论。
    在“实践论”中，毛泽东同志首先告诉我们，“生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然的现象，自然的性质，自然的规律性，人与自然的关系；而且经过生产活动，也在各种不同程度上逐渐地认识了人与人的一定的相互关系。”
    根据这个指示，我们经济工作者和经济理论工作者要认识生产的重要性，要把生产当作经济工作的基本部分。一切经济工作以生产为基础为中心，要为发展生产的总方针而服务，要把发展生产的总方针贯彻到自己部门工作中去。生产以外的经济工作部门，不是与生产无关，也不是可以无关，而需要在工作上与生产有密切的关联，配合生产推动生产。只有生产这一基本工作做好之后，其他经济工作才有基础，同时其他经济工作配合生产推动生产的时候，才能使生产顺利进行有效地发展，并且作好自己部门的工作。“生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。”这一基本原则，是不管我们认识与否以及认识程度如何，是在经济工作过程中客观地存在着作用着，只有我们经济工作者正确地深刻地认识这一基本原则，有意识地运用这一基本原则贯彻到实际工作中去，才能使我们经济工作做得好。
    因此，判断经济工作好坏的标准，在生产部门要看在经济工作中是否能起“最基本的实践活动，决定其他一切活动”的作用，其他经济部门对于生产部门是否能起配合生产推动生产发展生产的作用。因此也可以判断经济工作者对于这一基本原则的认识掌握与运用的程度如何。
    生产，如斯大林同志所说，有两个方面，两个必要因素：一个是生产力，即“人们对于物件和自然界力量的关系”（“这些物件和自然界力量是被利用生产物质资料的”）；一个是生产关系，即“人们彼此在生产过程中的关系”。生产又是生产力与生产关系“在物质资料生产过程中的统一之体现”（联共党史，第四章，第二节）。简单说来，生产是由生产力与生产关系两个必要因素构成的，又是这两个必要因素结合统一的运动。
    我们经济工作者，尤其是生产工作者必须在生产中，生产过程中认识人们对于自然界的关系，其性质和规律性，同时要在生产中，生产过程中认识人与人间的关系，其性质和规律性。只有从生产两个必要因素结合统一运动来认识生产才能具体的深入的认识。我们对于这方面的认识与掌握的正确与否以及程度的深浅成为判断我们的认识与工作好坏高低的标准。
            （三）
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，实践是我们知识产生、形成和发展的基本来源，“一个人的知识，不外直接知识和间接经验两个部分”。我们的经济工作者根据这种指示，不能以自己的工作经验为满足，更不能以书本知识为满足，必须在自己工作中多多积蓄经验（这是重要的），并且要吸取和接受他人的经验；不单注意一个时期的经验，并且须要长时期的经验；不只现在的经验，还要过去的经验；不单注意一部门一地区的经验，还要注意其他部门其他地区的经验；不只是中国的经验，还要外国的经验；不只注意成功的经验，还要注意失败的教训。这样才能在工作经验上充实自己，丰富自己。
    毛泽东同志同时告诉我们，经验的知识，不都是可靠的。我们“在实践过程中，开始只是看到过程中各个事物的现象方面，看到各个事物的片面，看到各个事物之间的外部联系”。这是属于感性的知识。我们还必须“从感性的认识到理性的认识”，才能认识“事物的全体的、本质的、内部联系的东西”。
    我们经济工作者根据这种指示，不要以自己工作上的感性知识为满足，要知道感性知识还只是低级阶段的认识，还只是表现现象片面的认识。必须经常注意掌握运用唯物辩证法与马列主义的经济理论，总结我们经济工作的经验。要注意经济工作的决议、决定、指示、工作计划布置和执行的过程及结果。实践的结果应成为工作总结重要项目之一，并判断工作好坏的标准。我们能够将工作经验集中积蓄加以科学的总结，“去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里的改造”，就能够比较正确地周到地深刻地认识我们的实践，辨别是非好歹，补充我们工作上的缺陷，修改我们工作上的错误。当然全面地本质地在内在的联系上认识复杂错综变化多端的财经现象是不容易的事，也不是一切经济工作者短时期内所能做到的。尤其是新民主主义经济全国建设才开始不久，其推移发展有待于今后的工作推动与工作进行，我们现在马上要认识新民主主义经济建设实践的全面情况（不只看现象还看本质，不只看外的联系，还要看内的联系与规律）与具体发展（发展的具体情况与具体步骤），当然是困难的，甚至有的是不可能的。但是全面地本质地在内在的联系上认识经济工作实践是高级领导方面对于我们经济工作实践上的要求，我们要向这方面努力，以避免表面地片面地看问题与处理问题的错误。
    新民主主义经济理论，如其他马列主义理论一样，是从实际中来又要回到实际中去。从新民主主义经济建设长期大量实践总结中得到某些经济规律，我们就能进一步比较全面地深入的认识了某些经济工作的实践。
    我们今后实践过程中可以利用这些经济规律，按照这些经济规律办理，更便于推动我们经济工作的实践。
    经济规律客观地存在于经济现象之中，在经济现象中起着其应有的作用。这种经济规律是可以被我们认识的。这种客观经济规律被认识的结果就形成为一定的经济原理。但其被认识，需要一定的条件并需要经过一定的过程。在工作实践过程中，当客观条件还未成熟，主观认识还未提高，我们对于某些经济规律还不能够认识的时候，就要盲目地受某些经济规律的支配，而对于经济工作就可能盲目地起着一定对消、阻碍以至破坏作用。其对消、阻碍、破坏作用的大小深浅要看我们经济工作实践违背它们的范围大小与程度深浅而定。当客观条件已经相当成熟，我们达到能够认识某些经济规律的时候，在这个范围内我们就能够在实践过程中有意识有计划地利用和控制这些经济规律为新民主主义的经济工作服务，而防止其盲目性的对消、阻碍、以及破坏作用。我们对于经济工作情况经济规律的认识愈能比较全面比较深刻，我们在实践过程中运用这些经济规律，就对经济工作的领导与掌握愈能加强，我们对经济上自发性盲目性以及其他的阻碍的斗争力量也愈大，我们的实践就能够比较按照计划方案顺利地进行，并获得效果。
            （四）
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，“客观过程的实践”“由于内部的矛盾与斗争，都是向前推移，向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应该跟着推移与发展”。根据这个指示，我们经济工作者要认识到新民主主义经济由低级阶段进到高级阶段的时候，必须针对具体经济工作实践情况的变化来进行工作。
    我们处于战争与农村被分割的环境的时候，我们需要掌握战时农村经济的特点与其运动规律。我们由农村进到城市并处在战争基本结束的时候，我们就需要掌握现在全国经济情况、特点与其运动规律。不单要掌握农业经济运动规律，还要掌握城市经济运动规律，并且要注意城乡物资交流与内外物资交流等等的规律以及公私兼顾劳资两利等等政策。
    我们处在农村的时候，有国营经济，合作经济与个体经济，主要是半自给自足经济的环境，虽有商品经济存在，也是不甚发展的。我们现在进到城市以后，又有比较发展的商品经济和以此为中心为基础的其他经济。
    这些经济，经过我们的实践，有的改变了生产关系，也改变了经济的性质；有的新的生产关系，新的经济建立起来了；有的经济没落了（不利于国计民生的）。上述三种经济也发生了变化，增加了新的内容，并且又有国家资本主义与私人资本主义经济。因为生产关系的改变，经济结构也起了变化，经济运动总规律就完全不同于帝国主义封建主义与官僚资本主义支配下的旧中国经济运动总规律。虽然现在的新民主主义经济与旧中国经济之间还有些共同点，如农村半自给自足经济存在与城市商品经济相当发达等等，但重要的不在于这些共同点，而在于这些经济的特殊性，经济运动总规律的不同。新民主主义经济不单完全不同于半殖民地半封建经济，就是新民主主义经济较高级阶段也不同于低级阶段，因而其经济的运动规律也有不同。
    新民主主义经济理论的特点，就在于认识这些经济的特点与经济运动的特殊规律。我们在实践过程中需要针对这些经济的特点定出办法，有意识地运用这些经济的特殊规律。我们要认识新民主主义经济是向社会主义经济过渡的经济，而新民主主义经济运动规律又不同于社会主义经济运动规律。在新民主主义经济之中，我们又要认识五种经济各带有其自己特点的运动规律。这五种经济形式及其带有自己特点的运动规律互相交错互相影响形成新民主主义经济现阶段经济运动的总趋势和总规律。我们如果能够比较正确地周到地深刻地认识与掌握新民主主义各种经济情况，运动规律及其发展的总趋势和总规律，我们就能够在实践过程中比较自由地、因此也就比较顺利地有效地进行我们经济工作。
    我们新民主主义经济由低级阶段向高级阶段推移的每一过程，都需要我们掌握全盘经济情况与其运动规律，次第加强国营经济对于其他经济的领导，加强新民主主义经济的计划性，提高新中国的生产力，由农业国走向工业国（新中国经济的工业化），并加强与巩固国防工业交通事业等等方面的建设。
    这一方面需要我们积极努力从事经济工作的实践，同时需要随着新民主主义经济建设的进行，提高我们对于经济工作实践的认识。我们要注意，不单经济思想不要落后于经济工作的实践，同时我们的经济工作思想还要在工作实践过程中起推动领导作用。因为我们新民主主义经济是具有计划性的经济，并且随着新民主主义经济建设的进行，这种计划性不单不减弱，还要加强。计划性的经济，并且需要加强的计划性的经济，正如毛泽东同志所说，如果“不能通观客观过程的全体，缺欠明确的方针，没有远大的前途”，就不能领导以达到其目的。相反地只有通观新民主主义各种经济过程的全体，掌握明确的经济工作方针，运用经济的力量与经济规律，有计划有步骤地进行工作向远大的前途前进的，才能有效地担负领导的责任。当然，我们的各级各种经济工作者，不能把这种责任完全推到高级领导方面，自身也要有这种认识，分担一部分的责任，只有这样，才能把我们的经济方针与政策正确地贯彻下去。
            （五）
    很明显，说到上述等等问题，理论的学习就重要了。毛泽东同志的“实践论”是我们理论学习的最好教材之一，在认识论、思想方法上给我们以正确的深刻的宝贵的指导。这是社会科学的基本理论，也是关联一切经济问题的基本观点与方法。基本观点与方法的正确与否，是马列主义理论与非马列主义的所谓“理论”的根本区别，是科学与非科学的根本分别。马列主义理论与非马列主义的所谓“理论”不只在各个问题上有重大的分歧，并且在认识论与方法上也有根本的差别。至于自称马列主义者的“左”右机会主义者虽然也以种种形式使用马列主义某些辞句，但其基本观点与方法是非马列主义的，因而其整个论调也是错误的。这就是说，一切错误的所谓理论都是与其基本观点与方法有关，基本的观点与方法既错，以此基本观点与方法为基础的全部见解也不能正确的。经济思想也是同样的情形，如果是主观和客观统一，认识和实践统一的观点与方法，就是马列主义的科学的。如果是“主观和客观相分裂，认识和实践相分裂”的观点与方法，是非马列主义的，错误的。
    毛泽东经济思想（或经济理论）与其基本观点和方法是密切不可分离的联系着统一着。我们学习“实践论”正是从基本方面来了解毛泽东思想，首先是与我们工作有关的经济思想。
    毛泽东同志的“实践论”具有科学的正确周到深刻的思想，发展的远见的观点，并具有党的革命的战斗的精神，内容宝贵丰富。如果我们努力学习，深入钻研，能够掌握这一著作的精神与实质，运用其观点与方法到我们工作中去，对于工作推动与工作效率的提高是有好的结果的。
