How to Organize Learning for Rural Teachers?
    Li Yang Li Ying

    Editor's Note: Currently, the learning problem of rural teachers is an important issue in various regions. This issue is one of the main topics of the First Session of the Second National Committee of the National Educational Workers' Union. This article proposes several specific methods for organizing teachers' learning based on the practical experience of Yuxian County, Chahar Province, which is worth referring to in other regions.

    Among the more than one million education workers nationwide, nearly 600,000 are scattered in vast rural areas, where learning conditions are very poor. Only larger schools can subscribe to a local newspaper in conjunction with the village office. Smaller schools rarely see newspapers and magazines throughout the year, and new books are even harder to come by. They all urgently demand learning.

    Generally speaking, the cultural level of rural primary school teachers is very low. For example, in the Yanbei region, teachers with a higher primary school education level account for 62 percent. In some areas, the cultural level of primary school teachers is even lower. A female teacher in the Second School of the First District of Yuxian County, Chahar Province, had only three years of schooling. When teaching arithmetic, she not only used compound numbers but also added decimal points. When teaching Chinese, she made three mistakes in five characters written on the blackboard; and in a test paper of less than 500 characters, she made twenty-three mistakes. A teacher at the attached primary school of the Xiheying Normal School wrote in a letter inviting parents to the school for a discussion: "Please do not fail to come!" Many people do not understand simple grammar, punctuation, and fraction algorithms.

    Therefore, improving the quality of teachers and organizing rural primary school teachers' learning has become the top priority for running rural primary schools well. Based on the results of our exploration and experimentation in Yuxian County, Chahar Province, over the past two months, the following methods can be used to organize teachers' learning.

    First, organize a professional communication network

    How to organize it? The entire county uses the County Normal School as the main station, and each district can establish a sub-station in places with complete primary schools. In grassroots committees without complete primary or higher primary schools, contact nearby sub-stations with complete primary or higher primary schools. Central schools below the district level establish communication groups. In this way, when there is a problem, the group first discusses and answers it. If it cannot be answered, it is submitted to the sub-station, main station, province, or Beijing for a solution. In this way, a county-wide professional communication network is organized. When schools have other necessary matters, they can also use the communication network to reflect problems or transmit information. This plays a significant role in helping teachers learn, connecting with each other, and facilitating communication between higher and lower levels.

    The organizational system of the main station: The principal of the Normal School serves as the station director, and the director of teaching serves as the deputy station director. Under it are: the Social Science Group (composed of teachers of politics, education, history, and geography, responsible for answering questions on current affairs, theory, education, and history and geography); the Chinese Language Group (composed of Chinese language teachers, responsible for answering questions on Chinese language); the Mathematics, Physics, and Natural Science Group (composed of mathematics, physics, and biology teachers, responsible for answering questions on physics, chemistry, arithmetic, and nature); the Music, Physical Education, Art, and Craft Group (composed of music, physical education, art, and craft teachers, responsible for answering questions on music, gymnastics, fine arts, and crafts); and the General Affairs and Documentation Group. In addition, a system of numbering, filing, receiving, dispatching, and registering has been established.

    How do sub-stations and groups carry out their work? Rural primary school teachers are relatively busy, and due to economic difficulties, they do not have money to buy stamps. We can organize older students as messengers between villages; on market days, we can entrust villagers to take questions to the sub-station, and after they are answered, we still ask the villagers to bring them back. For villages that are far away, we can divide the nearby villages into east and west lines according to local conditions. When passing on messages, we can mark the corners of the question paper with the words "Whoever can answer, please answer" to ask others to answer quickly. For complex problems, we can organically combine with transmission stations, and have them send special personnel to the questioner to provide answers.

    Second, spare-time study classes

    Spare-time study classes have the following three organizational forms:

    First, a form that combines individual learning and collective learning. This learning method is applicable to areas where villages are relatively dense. Under the leadership of the trade union, teachers are organized to study Chinese, arithmetic, and current affairs. Regular tests are held. And a strict system of leave, reporting, and inspection is established. Those who perform well should be encouraged, and those who perform poorly should be criticized. Second, the form of selecting courses to attend classes. Among the 21 members of the grassroots committee of Xiheying Normal School, 11 are staff members with low levels of education. Therefore, they adopted the method of attending classes, overcoming the shortcomings of not being able to persist in after-school learning (because the teachers are too busy after class to teach them on time). The selected subjects are Chinese, education, algebra, etc. And regulations on attending classes on time, requesting leave, submitting homework, and taking exams have been stipulated. The average score of the exams in the second semester of 1950 was above 70 points. In this way, they study for one hour during the day and use the time for learning culture in the evening to make up for their daily work, which does not affect their daily work. Third, the form of learning whatever is needed. For example, the central group of Shuibei Village in the Third District of Yuxian County includes a total of ten village schools, most of which are complex classes with four grades in one class. Some schools are planning to add senior grades next year. Therefore, the complex teaching method for more than four groups and the fraction teaching method for senior primary schools must be resolved immediately. Therefore, according to the principle of learning whatever is needed and learning whatever is taught, we study collectively for two and a half hours every Saturday afternoon (one hour for current affairs, one hour for fractions, and half an hour for complex teaching methods), do homework after class, and correct it collectively in the next Saturday's study. The masses are very satisfied with the above three types of spare-time learning, which are based on different situations, and the results are also great. However, issues such as learning materials, lecturers, and progress need to be further studied and resolved.

    Third, mobile libraries

    The experience of Yuxian County tells us that the organization of mobile libraries plays a certain role in helping everyone learn. We can adopt a free borrowing method, circulating regularly. For example, the First District of the county organized a mobile library by district (relatively concentrated, the farthest is no more than five li), with 172 books. It is divided into seven groups, each with more than 20 books. Attached are a book list and an opinion book. Readers can submit questions they do not understand to the professional communication network for answers. It circulates once a week. The Eleventh District divides the books into four groups according to the four member groups, circulating once a month. In order to protect the books and prevent loss or damage, each mobile library can establish borrowing rules. The sources of the books: each school purchases them with surplus office expenses; or purchases them with surplus production, such as the Chenggao Primary School in Yuxian County, where teachers and students purchase books with 50 percent of their production income; or they are donated by teachers.

　　怎样组织农村教师学习？
    李扬  李应
    编者按：目前各地农村教师的学习问题是一个重要的问题。此次全国教育工会第一届第二次全国委员会全体会议把它作为主要议题之一。本文根据察南蔚县的实际经验提出组织教师学习的若干具体办法，值得其他各地参考。
    在全国一百多万教育工作者中，差不多有六十万人散处在广大农村里，学习的条件很差。只有规模较大的学校才能和村公所合订一份地方报纸；规模小的学校，常年看不到报纸和杂志，新的书籍更不容易得到。他们都迫切地要求着学习。
    一般地说，农村小学教师的文化水平很低。例如雁北高小程度的教师占百分之六十二。某些地区的小学教师的文化水平更低，察南蔚县一区二校的一个女教员只读过三年书，教算术时既用了复名数，还加上小数点；教国语时在黑板上写五个字就错了三个；在不足五百字的试卷内就错了二十三个字。西合营师范附小教员在邀请学生家长来校谈话的信上写道：“请你勿必来！”很多人不懂简单文法，标点符号和分数算法。
    因此，提高教师的质量，组织农村小学教师学习，便成为目前办好农村小学的头等重要工作。经过两个多月来我们在察南蔚县摸索试验的结果，可用以下几种办法组织教师学习。
    第一，组织业务通讯网
    怎样组织呢？全县以县立师范学校为总站，各区凡有完小的地方可建立分站。在没有完小、高小地区的基层委员会，便和附近有完小、高小的分站取得联系。区以下中心学校成立通讯小组。这样，有问题时就先由小组讨论解答，不能解答时就提到分站、总站、省、北京，请求解答。如此便组织了全县的业务通讯网。各学校有其他必要事情时，也可利用通讯网把问题反映上去或传达下来。这在帮助教师学习，彼此联系与上下贯通上，都起了很大的作用。
    总站的组织系统：站长由师范学校校长担任，教导主任则担任副站长。下设社会科学组（由政治、教育、史地教员组成，负责解答有关时事、理论、教育及史地方面的问题）、语文组（由国文教员组成，负责解答国文方面的问题）、数理自然组（由数理生物教员组成，负责解答物理、化学、算术、自然等方面的问题）、音体美工组（由音乐、体育、美工教员组成，负责解答音乐、体操、美术、工艺等方面的问题）、总务和文书组。此外，并建立了编号、归档、收发与登记等制度。
    分站与小组间怎样展开工作？农村小学教师的工作比较忙，而且由于经济困难，没有钱买邮票。我们可以组织年龄较大的学生作村与村的传递人；逢集时可托老乡把问题捎到分站，解答以后仍请老乡捎回。距离远的村子，可根据当地具体情况把附近的子庄分成东西两线，传递时可在问题纸的角上标上“谁能解答便请解答”的字样，请别人迅速解答。还有复杂的问题，可和传授站有机的结合起来，由他们派专人到提问人那里去给以解答。
    第二，业余学习班
    业余学习班有以下三种组织形式：
    首先是个人学习与集体学习相结合的形式。这种学习方式可适用于村子比较稠密的地区。在工会领导下组织教师进行国文、算术及时事等学习。定期举行测验。并建立严格的请假、汇报、检查等制度。对成绩好的应给予鼓励，成绩差的则给以批评。其次是选科随堂听课的形式。西合营师范学校基层委员会二十一个委员中有十一个职员，文化程度都不高，于是采取了随堂听课的办法，克服了不能坚持课后学习的缺点（因课后教员太忙，不能按时为他们上课）。选学的科目有国语、教育、代数等。并规定了按时上课、请假、交作业、考试等制度。一九五○年下学期考试成绩平均在七十分以上。这样，他们在白天学习一小时，晚上利用学习文化的时间补做日间的工作，并没有影响自己的日常工作。第三是用什么学什么的形式。如蔚县三区水北村中心组共包括村校十处，多为四个年级一班的复式班。某些学校明年准备增设高级组。因此，四组以上的复式教学法、高小的分数教学法必须即时解决。于是，根据用什么学什么，教什么学什么的原则，每星期六下午集体学习两小时半（时事一小时、分数一小时、复式教学法半小时），课后自己做作业，在下一个星期六的学习中集体订正。对以上根据不同情况的三种业余学习，群众都很满意，成绩也很大。不过学习材料、讲师、进度等问题，还待进一步的研究和解决。
    第三，流动图书馆
    蔚县的经验告诉我们，流动图书馆的组织在帮助大家学习上起了一定的作用。我们可以采取自由借阅的方式，定期流动。例如该县一区以区为单位组织了流动图书馆（比较集中，最远的不过五里），现有图书一百七十二册。分成七组，每组二十余册。附有书目与意见簿。读者可把不懂的问题，提交业务通讯网解答。每周流动一次。十一区则把书籍按四个会员小组分成四组，每月流动一次。为了保护书籍，防止遗失损坏，各流动图书馆可订立借阅规则。书籍的来源：各校用办公费节余购买；或用生产盈余购买，如蔚县城高小师生以生产所得的百分之五十购买图书；或由教员捐赠。
