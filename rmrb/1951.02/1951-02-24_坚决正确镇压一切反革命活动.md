　　Resolutely and Correctly Suppress All Counter-Revolutionary Activities
　　Minister of Justice of the Central People's Government Shī Liáng
　　The Central People's Government has promulgated the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," which is a major event in consolidating the people's democratic cause. Judicial cadres at all levels should immediately pay serious attention to studying and implementing it.

　　According to the summary reports of the people's judicial organs in thirty-two regions regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries (including three from the Great Administrative Regions, nineteen from Provincial Courts, three from Provincial Branch Courts, six from Municipal Courts, and one from County Courts), it has been proven that counter-revolutionaries are attempting to endanger the people's democratic regime and the people's democratic cause through various means, such as organizing armed rebellions, stealing intelligence, robbery and murder, sabotaging economic construction, spreading rumors and confusing the public, and undermining land reform. The people of the whole country, especially our judicial workers, should be highly vigilant. In the past, people's judicial organs at all levels have dealt blows and suppressed counter-revolutionary activities in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and have achieved some success; however, upon review, there is regret that there was "insufficient suppression and excessive leniency." The main deviations were: Cases that should have been handled were not handled. For example, in Aohan Banner, Rehe Province, a certain national special agent secretly developed a reactionary organization in the village and spread rumors to undermine production. The court casually released him on the grounds that "the criminal is of middle peasant status and there is nothing to it." Secondly, cases that should have been severely dealt with were given light sentences. For example, Wu Zhankui in Dingbian, Northern Shaanxi, had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than twenty years, killing six of our senior cadres, oppressing the people, and committing numerous evils, causing the masses to hate him to the bone, but the court sentenced him to only ten years in prison on the grounds that "the criminal is already sixty years old, about to die, and the criminal facts all occurred before liberation." Thirdly, cases were handled slowly. Courts often delayed handling counter-revolutionary cases, and the more serious the case, the longer it was delayed, with some cases being delayed for one or two years without being concluded, resulting in the loss of the effect of timely suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Furthermore, management was lax, with prison work unilaterally emphasizing education and transformation, regarding prisons as schools and factories. Prisoners could manage prisoners, and prisoners were not given the necessary control, creating loopholes for counter-revolutionary prisoners to escape or riot.

　　Why did these deviations occur? How should we further overcome these deviations and correctly implement the central government's policy of combining suppression with leniency to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities? According to the inspection summaries of people's courts in various places, I believe it is necessary to clarify the following issues.

　　First of all, some judicial workers have an insufficient understanding that both the court and the prison are tools of the people's democratic dictatorship, and do not understand that for the enemies of the people, they are "not 'benevolent' things"; at the same time, there is some underestimation of the enemy, thinking that the revolution has been victorious and that a few special agents can still do anything. They do not pay attention to Stalin's teaching that "the more the power of the state grows, the more fiercely the remnants of the dying class will resist"; they do not pay attention to Chairman Mao's repeated warnings that after the open, visible, and armed enemies are overthrown, the hidden, invisible, and unarmed enemies still exist, and that "they will inevitably fight us to the death."

　　Secondly, in the minds of some cadres, there are confused concepts about the issues of suppression and leniency, punishment and education. The complete policy of "combining suppression and leniency" towards counter-revolutionary elements is understood in a fragmented way, with "suppression" being equated with "killing" and "leniency" being equated with "ignoring." As a result, the principle of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded" is also grasped with deviations. It is mechanically believed that there is only one ringleader in a case or a place; the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, even if their crimes are heinous, are not considered ringleaders. It is believed that "the coerced are not to be questioned" means that they are not to be managed at all, and the "coerced" are confused with "accomplices" and even "co-conspirators," and can be generally "not questioned"; "meritorious service" is not distinguished between true and false, and even confessing mistakes truthfully and being falsely active in prison are considered "meritorious service" and should be rewarded. Based on this wrong understanding, the sentencing in the trial work loses its standard and generally leans towards leniency. Even after the State Council and the Supreme People's Court issued the "Instructions on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities," the spirit of the four sentencing standards indicated therein was still not fully implemented. In prison policy, prisoners are equated with the people, and prison cadres serve prisoners with the spirit of serving the people, unilaterally emphasizing the education and transformation of prisoners, and neglecting that the task of the prison is more importantly control, and that control itself is a kind of punishment. As a result, the deviation of "lax management" criticized by the masses has arisen. This deviation is related to the idea of unilaterally emphasizing "the omnipotence of education" and the "benevolent administration" thought that even the most heinous counter-revolutionary ringleaders should be "killed as little as possible" without principle.

　　We must remember Lenin's teaching that "leniency towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people." Therefore, "for counter-revolutionary elements, the first thing is suppression. Only suppression can make them confess their crimes, and only after they confess their crimes can we talk about leniency." "Leniency can only be combined with suppression" (State Council "Instructions on Strengthening People's Judicial Work"). It is absolutely impermissible to separate "suppression" and "leniency." "Suppression" does not necessarily mean killing (killing is of course the most severe suppression), but also includes punishments such as imprisonment; "leniency" is not complete disregard, but after the counter-revolutionary elements confess their crimes, the people's judicial organs can consider the circumstances and give lighter, reduced, or exempted punishment. We must correctly grasp the principle of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded." There is not necessarily only one "ringleader" in a case, and the secondary evil must also be punished. As for how many ringleaders and secondary evil there are in a case, it should be judged according to the severity of their counter-revolutionary circumstances. "The coerced" refers to those who, under the coercion of counter-revolutionary forces, lost their freedom of will and had to do something for the counter-revolutionaries; "meritorious service" refers to those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service. Therefore, "leniency" is conditional and has limits, as clearly stipulated in Article 14 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries": "Those who 'may be given lighter, reduced, or exempted punishment at discretion' must be: '(1) Those who voluntarily surrender to the People's Government and sincerely confess their crimes; (2) Those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes before or after exposing or reporting; (3) Those who are coerced or deceived by counter-revolutionary elements and are indeed not voluntary; (4) Those whose counter-revolutionary crimes before liberation were not significant, and who have indeed repented and severed ties with counter-revolutionary organizations after liberation.'"

　　Similarly, for criminals imprisoned in prisons, they "must be given punishment. Only punishment can make them confess their crimes, and only after they confess their crimes can we talk about education and transformation. Education can only be combined with punishment. It is wrong to unilaterally emphasize 'education and transformation.' It is also necessary to correct neglecting education and transformation work after punishing and confessing" (State Council "Instructions on Strengthening People's Judicial Work"). However, punishment and control and education and transformation are not equally important in quantity, nor are they mutually separated or sequential. Rather, education and transformation work is carried out on prisoners under the major premise of punishment and control. Therefore, the punishment of prisoners is not only deprivation of their freedom by imprisonment, but also compulsory labor, so that they can understand in the transformation of labor that this is the deserved crime and establish a labor perspective in order to start anew. In terms of thought, they must be given education to know and confess their crimes, so that they can "thoroughly correct their past mistakes." In short, the imprisonment, compulsory labor, and education of prisoners are all aimed at making prisoners realize that national laws and disciplines cannot be violated, feel the error of crime, and thoroughly reform themselves.

　　Third, some cadres still have a "Six Laws viewpoint" in their minds and often give light sentences to important counter-revolutionary cases. The reasons are as follows: "The prisoner is young or old," "Although blood debts are numerous, he is willing to confess," "Although he is the mastermind, he did not take action," "Although the crime is heinous, he is not the mastermind," "Although the crime is heinous, he has fled or has not fled," "Past deeds are not investigated," "Conspiracy to sabotage is an attempted crime," "It is a crime within the scope of duty," "He shows obedience after being arrested," "First offense," "Although blood debts are numerous, he had relations with the revolutionary side in the past," "Although there is a counter-revolutionary purpose, his organization is not the orthodox organization of bandits and special agents," "Although the bandits and special agents killed people, it was out of self-defense," and so on.

　　Among them, there is also the so-called "attempted" theory, that is, they talk a lot about "completed and attempted" for counter-revolutionary activities, saying that the lurking and waiting for rebellion of counter-revolutionary elements is "attempted," as if it must be until the enemy overthrows the people's democratic regime, kills people, sets fires, or completes the sabotage of the people's democratic cause, then it is called "completed" and should be "guilty of unpardonable crimes"; otherwise, the counter-revolutionary has not "attempted" to undermine the revolution, so it should be called "attempted" and should be tolerated. Obviously, this is confusing the completed and attempted of ordinary criminal offenders with counter-revolutionary offenders. It should be understood that anyone who joins a counter-revolutionary organization and has a counter-revolutionary purpose has counter-revolutionary behavior and should be convicted of counter-revolution, and should no longer be called "attempted." The so-called "leniency for confession" or "obedience after arrest should be lenient" is also incorrect. In general, if counter-revolutionary elements sincerely confess their crimes and repent and rehabilitate, we should give them discretionary leniency, but we cannot completely confuse sincere and voluntary confession with confession in court. This is a manifestation of the old judicial personnel's credulity in confessions or only looking at the surface and neglecting investigation and research, and not distinguishing between the "confession" and "obedience" of prisoners after being arrested and the completely voluntary and conscious confession and obedience. At the same time, it must be recognized that the "confession" and "obedience" of counter-revolutionary elements are sometimes not entirely reliable, and trial staff and prison staff cannot be deceived by the false confession and false obedience of cunning criminals without vigilance. If the punishment can be reduced because it is "a crime within the scope of duty," or "just executing a counter-revolutionary order," or "just issuing a counter-revolutionary order," it is tantamount to admitting that all counter-revolutionary duties, orders, etc. are legal. Some people regard the killing of people by counter-revolutionary criminals who resist arrest as a forgivable act of self-defense and call it "legitimate defense," which is even more lacking in position, tantamount to condoning counter-revolutionary elements to resist the People's Government and admitting that bandits and special agents have the freedom to counter-revolution, while the government or the people have no right to pursue and arrest them. There are also those who give light sentences to bandits and special agents who have been educated and released by me and continue to commit evil, thinking that the government has forgiven him once or twice, and should always give him unconditional and unlimited leniency, without considering that unlimited leniency to an unrepentant counter-revolutionary element will cause great harm to the people. As for simply forgiving counter-revolutionary criminals from their age, origin, or any social reason, it is also a confused, indiscriminate "thinking for the defendant" viewpoint, and I do not know that the actual harm suffered by the people cannot be reduced by this at all. In short, all of this is not considering consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and the result is objectively helping the counter-revolution. We must thoroughly liquidate these extremely wrong viewpoints and correctly judge the nature of the crime and determine the punishment in accordance with the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." In the implementation, we must truly understand and grasp the spirit of this major regulation. Do not execute it mechanically. If you encounter counter-revolutionary behavior that is not fully stipulated in the regulations, it should be handled in accordance with Article 16 of the regulations, that is, "Other criminals who commit crimes for the purpose of counter-revolution that are not stipulated in these regulations may be punished by analogy with similar crimes in these regulations." We must resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and truly protect the interests of the people.

　　Finally, when trying counter-revolutionary cases, we must prevent carelessness and acting rashly. All judgments must go through careful investigation and research, and oppose the bad style of not paying attention to evidence and trusting confessions or "forcing, obtaining, and believing confessions," so as to achieve not letting go of bad people, nor mistakenly falling into the enemy's plot to retaliate against good people, and making the judgment conform to the policy. Similarly, for convicted criminals, if there is a major error in the judgment, after being accused by the prosecuting agency, the masses are dissatisfied, or they find it themselves, they should be retried and resentenced in accordance with the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," and should not make mistakes again. However, we should not conduct a retrial and resentencing of all concluded counter-revolutionary cases. At present, we should concentrate our efforts on handling unresolved counter-revolutionary criminals and resolutely fight against those who are still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. Let me repeat Chairman Mao's warning again: Counter-revolutionaries will never willingly die! I hope that all comrades in the people's judicial work across the country will carefully study the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," work together to implement this major regulation, and strive to complete the glorious historical task of "suppressing reactionaries, protecting the people," and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　坚决正确镇压一切反革命活动
    中央人民政府司法部长  史良
    中央人民政府颁布了“惩治反革命条例”，这是巩固人民民主事业的一件大事。各级司法干部应即认真注意研究贯彻。
    根据三十二个地区人民司法机关关于镇压反革命的总结报告（计大行政区三、省院十九、省分院三、市院六、县院一）都证明：反革命用组织武装暴乱，窃取情报、抢劫杀害、破坏经建、造谣惑众、破坏土改等方式，无孔不入地在企图危害人民民主政权及人民民主事业，应高度提起全国人民，尤其是我们司法工作者的警惕性。各级人民司法机关为了巩固人民民主专政，过去对反革命活动，虽曾予以打击和镇压，并获得了些成绩；但检讨起来却有“镇压不足，宽大有余”之憾，其主要偏向是：该办的不办，比方热河熬汉旗某国特在村中秘密发展反动组织，并造谣破坏生产，法院以“该犯系中农成份，没啥”而马虎释放。其次，是该严办的又判的轻，比方陕北定边武占奎虽反革命达二十余年，曾杀害我高级干部六人，欺压人民，作恶多端，群众恨之入骨，法院却以“该犯年已六十，行将入木，并以犯罪事实均在解放以前，而处徒刑十年”。其三，是办的慢，即法院常将反革命案拖延不办，越是案情重大者越是拖延得久，有拖至一、二年未结者，致失去及时镇压反革命的效果。再有，是管的松，即监狱工作中片面强调教育改造，视监狱为学校、为工厂，犯人可以管犯人，不给犯人以应有的管制，给反革命犯造成逃跑或暴动的空隙。
    为什么产生这些偏向呢？应如何进一步克服这些偏向和正确贯彻中央镇压与宽大相结合的政策，坚决镇压反革命活动呢？根据各地人民法院的检查总结，我认为对下列问题有指明的必要。
    首先是由于有些司法工作者对法庭与监狱都是人民民主专政的工具这一点认识不足，不了解对于人民的敌人，它们“不是什么‘仁慈’的东西”；同时存在一些轻敌的思想，以为革命胜利了，几个特务还能干得了什么，不注意斯大林所教导我们的“国家威力越增长，垂死阶级余孽的抵抗也就愈猛烈”；不注意毛主席再三告诫我们的：在公开的、有形的、拿枪的敌人被打倒之后，隐蔽的、无形的、不拿枪的敌人依然存在，而且“必然的要和我们作拚死的斗争”。
    其次，由于在有些干部思想中对镇压与宽大，惩罚与教育问题上存在着糊涂观念，把对于反革命分子“镇压与宽大相结合”的完整政策割裂地了解为“镇压”就是“杀”，“宽大”就是“不管”，因而对于“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”原则的掌握亦有偏差，机械地以为一案或一地的首恶只有一个；其余的反革命分子，纵然罪恶滔天，也都不算首恶。以为“胁从不问”即是根本不管，而把“胁从”与“从犯”甚至“共犯”混同一起，可以概予“不问”；“立功”也不区别立的是真功与假功，有把坦白认错，据实招供和在监狱中的假积极也就认为是“立功”应予奖励。基于这样错误的认识，便在审判工作的量刑上失去了准绳，一般地是偏向于宽纵，甚至在政务院和最高人民法院发布了“关于镇压反革命活动的指示”后，对于其中所指示的四条量刑标准的精神仍是贯彻不够。在狱政政策上则把犯人与人民群众混同，监狱干部拿为群众服务的精神去为犯人服务，片面强调对于犯人的教育改造，忽视监狱的任务更重要的是管制，并且管制本身就是一种惩罚，于是便产生了群众所批评的“监而不牢”偏向。而这种偏向又是与片面地强调“教育万能”的思想以及无原则地对于穷凶极恶的反革命首恶分子，也主张“少杀为原则”的“仁政”思想相联系着的。
    必须记住列宁所教导我们的“对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍”，因此，“对反革命分子来说，首先是镇压，只有镇压才能使他们服罪，只有在他们服罪之后，才能谈到宽大”。“宽大只能结合着镇压来进行”，（政务院“加强人民司法工作的指示”）决不可把“镇压”与“宽大”割裂开来看，“镇压”不一定只是杀（杀当然是最严厉的镇压），也还包括着徒刑等惩罚；“宽大”也不是完全不管，而是在反革命分子服罪之后，人民司法机关得斟酌情形，予以从轻，减轻或免予处刑。我们必须正确地掌握“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的原则，“首恶”在一案中不一定只有一个，次恶也一定要办，至于一案中有几个首恶与次恶，则应按其反革命情节的轻重来判断；“胁从”指在反革命势力胁迫之下，失去了意志自由，不得不给反革命做点事情而言；“立功”是指真诚悔过立功者而言，所以“宽大”是有条件的是有边的，正如“惩治反革命条例”第十四条所明白规定的“得酌情从轻，减轻或免予处刑”者必须是：“（一）自动向人民政府真诚自首悔过者；（二）在揭发、检举前或以后真诚悔过立功赎罪者；（三）被反革命分子胁迫、欺骗，确非自愿者；（四）解放前反革命罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改并与反革命组织断绝联系者。”
    同样地，对于监禁在监狱里的罪犯，也“必须给以惩罚，只有惩罚才能使他们认罪，只有在他们认罪之后，才能谈到教育改造。教育只能结合着惩罚来进行，片面地强调“教育改造”是不对的，在惩罚认罪之后，忽视教育改造工作，也是必须纠正的”（政务院“加强人民司法工作的指示”）。但惩罚管制与教育改造，在分量上既不是半斤八两等量齐观，在关系上也不是互相割裂的或先后阶段的关系，而是在惩罚管制的大前题下对于犯人进行教育改造工作。所以，对于犯人的惩罚，单是以监禁来剥夺其自由还不够，还必须强制其劳动，使之在劳动的改造中认识这是应得之罪，并建立劳动观点，以便重新做人；在思想上则必须给以知罪、认罪的教育，使其“痛改前非”。总之，对于犯人的监禁、强制劳动与教育都是在使犯人认识国家法纪之不容破坏，感受犯罪之错误后，彻底改过自新。
    第三，有些干部思想中尚存在“六法观点”，常常对重要反革命案件判得轻，其理由有如下之多：“犯人年轻或年老”，“虽血债累累，但尚肯坦白”，“虽系主谋，但未动手”，“虽罪大恶极，但非主谋”，“虽罪大恶极，但已畏罪逃走或未逃走”，“既往不究”，“阴谋破坏是未遂罪”，“是职务内的犯罪”，“逮捕后表现服从”，“初犯”，“虽然血债累累，但过去与革命方面曾有过关系”，“虽有反革命目的，其组织尚非匪特之正统组织”，“虽系匪特杀人，但系出于自卫”等等。
    其中更有所谓“未遂”论，即对于反革命活动还大谈其“已遂与未遂”，说反革命分子的潜伏和待机暴乱是“未遂”，似乎必须等到敌人推翻了人民民主政权、杀了人、放了火或完成了破坏了人民民主事业，那末才叫做“已遂”，才应“罪不容诛”；否则反革命既未遂其搞垮革命之“目的”便应叫“未遂”，便应予以宽容。显然，这是把普通刑事犯与反革命犯的既遂未遂混为一谈。应该了解：凡参加了反革命组织，有了反革命目的，即有了反革命行为，即应以反革命定罪，而不应再叫“未遂”。所谓“坦白就宽大”或“逮捕后表现服从应宽大”，也是不正确的，一般的反革命分子，如若真诚坦白悔过自新，我们应给予酌情宽大，但不能把真诚自觉坦白与法庭上的招供完全混为一谈，这是旧司法人员轻信口供或光看表面而忽视调查研究的一种表现，没有把犯人被捕后的“坦白”“服从”与完全出于自动自觉的坦白，服从区别开来。同时，必须认清：反革命分子的“坦白”与“服从”，有时是不尽可靠的，审判工作人员与监狱工作人员不能毫无警惕地为狡猾罪犯的假坦白假服从所迷惑。如因是“职务内的犯罪”，或“只是执行反革命命令”，或“只是发出反革命命令”便可减轻其刑，这无异于承认一切反革命的职务、命令等等都是合法的。有的把反革命犯的拒捕杀人，视为可原谅的自卫行为称为“正当防卫”更是毫无立场，无异放纵反革命分子反抗人民政府，承认匪特有反革命的自由，而政府或人民却无追捕之权。还有的对于曾经我教育释放而又继续作恶的匪特予以轻判，以为政府曾对他宽恕过一两次，便应该永远对他无条件无止境的宽大，而不考虑到对一个怙恶不悛的反革命分子宽纵无底，将会给人民造成莫大的危害。至于单纯从反革命罪犯的年龄、出身，或什么社会原因予以原谅，也是一种糊涂的、不分敌我的“替被告着想”的观点，不知人民所受的实际危害丝毫不能因此而减轻。总之，这一切都不是为巩固人民民主专政着想，其结果是客观上帮助了反革命。我们必须彻底清算这些极端错误的观点，并正确的按照“惩治反革命条例”去判辨罪质，决定罪刑，在执行中必须切实领会和掌握这一重大条例的精神。万勿机械的执行，如遇条例上未尽规定的反革命行为，应按该条例第十六条办理，即“以反革命为目的之其他罪犯未经本条例规定者，得比照本条例类似之罪处刑”，务期对于一切反革命活动给予坚决镇压，对于人民利益给予确实保障。
    最后，在审理反革命案件时，必须防止粗枝大叶，草率从事。一切判决必须经过周密的调查研究，反对不重证据轻信口供或“逼、供、信”的不良作风，以达到不放松坏人，也不误中敌人反噬好人的奸计，而使判决合乎政策；同样地，对已决罪犯，如果在判决上有重大错误，经检举机关控告，群众不满或自己发觉者，均应根据“惩治反革命条例”重审改判，不得将错就错。但不应对所有已决反革命案犯都进行一次翻案改判。目前我们应集中力量处理未决的反革命犯并对尚在进行反革命活动的分子进行坚决的斗争。让我再将毛主席的告诫重复一遍：反革命决不会自甘死亡的！希望全国人民司法工作同志好好研究“惩治反革命条例”，一致努力为执行这一重大条例，为完成“镇压反动，保护人民”，巩固人民民主专政的光荣的历史任务而奋斗。
