　　Certain Tendencies in the Creation of Songs for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Sun Shen
    In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, music workers have created over a thousand songs, which have played an important role in stimulating and inspiring the patriotic sentiments of the masses. However, because many songwriters lack sufficient experience and understanding of the new real life and the new feelings of the masses, and lack the ability to generalize and refine, and some even replace the real feelings of the masses with their own subjective imaginations, their works inevitably become generalized and fail to deeply move people.
    First, the musical language is not well integrated with the content of the lyrics. For example, in "Smash the Dog Legs of the Invaders" (lyrics and music by Ma Lin, published in "Selected Creative Songs" Volume 2, edited by the Shanghai Branch of the Musicians Association), the first two lines – according to the requirements of the lyrics, it should be full of indignant emotions, but the musical language used by the author is so light; especially the staccato notes in "Truman," "Learn from Japan," and "Come to Annex," further strengthen this impression. As a result, the musical emotion and the content of the lyrics are so far apart that they even contradict each other. This is mainly because the author lacks a high degree of hatred for the gangster behavior of American imperialism in invading Korea and attempting to launch a war of aggression, or lacks the artistic ability to express this hatred. Perhaps the author thought that such a jumping rhythm was precisely a description of American imperialism's delusion? This idea is obviously inappropriate. Because any ideological content can only be expressed through the intrinsic emotions of the melody, not through the pursuit of rhythmic form.
    Similarly, the songs "Support Korea and Defend Peace" (lyrics by Lü Jin, music by Liu Xuechang, published in "Selected Songs from Southern Jiangsu," edited by the Southern Jiangsu Federation of Literary and Art Circles) and "Everyone Go to Military Cadre School" (lyrics and music by Yao Mu, published in "Selected Creative Songs" Volume 4, edited by the Shanghai Branch of the Musicians Association) also rely on the use of pure compositional techniques and lack the expression of sincere emotions: the lyrics of these two songs are relatively conceptual, which may naturally affect the creation of the music to a certain extent. If we only analyze from the perspective of the melodies, the structural forms of these two songs seem to be quite complete, especially the former, the melody gradually rises from a low point and also expands, reaching a certain emotion. But this emotion is old and artificial, formed by relying on pure compositional techniques, and not a true expression of the new feelings of the Chinese people who have stood up. Therefore, the works appear pale and without flesh and blood.
    Starting from this artificial emotion, it is impossible to produce fresh and lively musical images. Therefore, another common characteristic is inevitably formed, that is, using a relatively effortless method, constructing the melody with a series of broken chord variations. For example, the melody of "Support Korea and Defend Peace" uses two chords – the tonic chord and the dominant seventh chord; the melody of "Everyone Go to Military Cadre School" uses three chords – the tonic chord, the dominant chord, and the subdominant chord. Naturally, we do not object to the use of chord progressions in melodies. This kind of progression is sometimes very necessary and very effective, but it should be at necessary times. If the use of chord progressions is only to cover up the poverty of language, like these two songs, then it becomes a meaningless accumulation of notes.
    The melody of Lu Huabai's "Welcoming Heroes" (a section from "Heroes Medley," published in "People's Music" Issue 3, edited by the National Musicians Association) has this characteristic even more. The entire song is almost entirely composed of the four notes 6135. From the perspective of rhythm, there seems to be change and contrast, but how monotonous and lacking in enthusiasm it sounds!
    It is very possible that these authors believe that such a melody progression is a popular and easy-to-sing mass song. They do not understand the issue from the essence of how to experience the life of the masses and how to grasp the feelings of the masses, but only look at the issue formally, which is obviously incorrect. Comrade Khrennikov, Secretary of the Soviet Composers' Association, has a passage in his essay "The Present Day of Music Criticism and Its Tasks," which is very useful to us. He said:
    "...Most composers have too simple a view of artistic simplicity. They only pursue a work that is easily accepted by the public, neglecting the importance of refining musical images. And we know that true simplicity in art cannot be achieved by the easiest method, passively utilizing modern popular music or past musical expressions as one's own musical techniques and images.
    "When pursuing musical simplicity and easy understanding, composers should never forget that the path to simplicity lies in a deep, organic experience of the selected theme and content, and in a full grasp of realistic techniques."
    Isn't this the right prescription for our above-mentioned creative methods?
    Secondly, there is the abuse of folk tunes. The treasure trove of folk music is worthy of our cherishing and absorption, and there is no doubt about this. Moreover, we have indeed made many achievements in this regard. Comrade Xian Xinghai's many works, such as "Yellow River Cantata," "Production Cantata," etc., are concrete examples. But absorbing heritage should be critically and organically, and must also be properly processed and given new life. Because old folk songs and ditties are produced on the basis of the old society, they have good and healthy aspects, but they also have bad and harmful things. If we do not pay due attention to this point when using folk music materials, we will inevitably produce the opposite effect. Comrade Shu Mo's "America is Such a Country" (original lyrics by Zang Kejia, published in the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland" song collection, Volume 2, edited by the Hangzhou Musicians Association) is such an example—
    This tune is adapted from the ditty "Playing Dominoes." The beginning of the song is marked with the expression marks "contemptuously, hatefully." Obviously, the author attempts to use this tune to express the masses' feelings of contempt, hatred, and indignation towards American imperialism, but the fact is that it failed. Because a flirtatious ditty melody like "Playing Dominoes" can never express the feelings of the Chinese people today resisting American imperialist aggression. On the contrary, it has a frivolous and ridiculous feeling. For lyrics such as "A poisonous snake of aggression, just wants to swallow people," the musical language created by the author is actually a jumping rhythm and a harmonious melody. Can this be an accurate portrayal of the image of American imperialism? Such a musical language cannot inspire the masses' hatred of America. In addition, the two filler words "aiyo" before the repeated sentence (not in the original lyrics, presumably added by the composer) also appear vulgar here. Perhaps the author only wanted to retain the original form of the song, with no other intention, but it is too prominent, thus weakening the seriousness of the theme. Comrade Shu Mo has had satisfactory achievements in the use of folk music materials in the past, such as "Cooperation Between the Army and the People" and "You Bad Thing," which are both better works, but the tune "America is Such a Country" is not good.
    The above-mentioned phenomena are tendencies worthy of close attention in this song creation. In order to make musical creation more deeply express the life of our era, which is full of fighting enthusiasm, and lead people towards a more magnificent tomorrow, our composers must more deeply understand the heart of this great era and express it in a more concentrated and refined way. This is the primary task of our music workers at present.
    The output of our song creation is quite fast and large. If we can take a step further in quality, then it will generate greater power to inspire the people to actively engage in the construction of the new society and enhance the belief in defending world peace.

　　抗美援朝歌曲创作中的某些倾向
    孙慎
    音乐工作者在抗美援朝运动中，创作了千首以上的歌曲，对于激发与鼓舞群众爱国主义的情绪，起了重要的作用。但是由于许多歌曲作者，对新的现实生活，新的群众感情，还缺少足够的体验和理解，还缺乏概括和提炼的能力，有的甚至仅以自己主观的想像代替了真实的群众感情，因而他们的作品就不免流于一般化，感人不深。
    首先是音乐语言与歌词内容没有很好地结合起来。如《砸断进犯者的狗腿》（马琳词曲，载《创作歌选》二集，音协上海分会编）的头上两句——根据歌词内容的要求，它应该是充满愤激的情绪的，但作者所采用的音乐语言却是那样的轻快；特别是“杜鲁门”、“学日本”、“来并吞”这些地方的顿音，更加强了这一印象。以致曲调情绪与歌词内容，离开那样远，甚至发生矛盾。这主要由于作者对于美帝侵略朝鲜并妄想发动侵略战争的强盗行为缺乏高度的憎恨，或缺乏表现这种憎恨的艺术能力。也许作者以为这样一种跳跃的节奏不正是美帝妄想的描述么？这个想法显然是不妥的。因为任何思想内容只有通过曲调内在情绪才能表现出来，而不是从节奏形式的追求上所能达到。
    又如“支援朝鲜保卫和平”（绿津词，刘雪厂曲。载苏南活页歌选，苏南文联编）及“大家到军事干校去”（姚牧词曲。载创作歌选四集，音协上海分会编）两歌，也是依靠单纯作曲技巧的运用，而缺乏真挚情感的表现：这两首歌词都是比较概念化的，自然也可能在一定程度上影响乐曲的创作。我们若只从曲调方面加以分析，则这两首歌曲的结构形式，似乎都是相当完整的，特别是前一首，曲调由低处逐渐高昂，也有伸展，达成一定的情绪。但这种情绪是旧的，并且是人为的，是依靠单纯的作曲技巧所形成，不是真实的表现了站起来的中国人民的新的感情。因之，作品显得苍白，没有血肉。
    从这种人为的情绪出发，是不可能产生新鲜活泼的音乐形象来的。因此，不可避免地形成另一个共同的特点，即用比较省力的办法，以一连串和弦的分解变化构成曲调。如《支援朝鲜保卫和平》的曲调进行使用了两个和弦——主和弦和属七和弦；《大家都到军干校去》的曲调进行使用了三个和弦，——主和弦，属和弦，下属和弦。自然我们并不反对曲调中使用和弦进行，这种进行，有时是很需要，而且很有效果的，但这应该是在必要的时候。如果使用和弦进行仅仅是为了掩饰语言的贫乏，像这两首歌曲那样，这就成了无意义的音符堆砌了。
    陆华柏作的《迎英雄》（《英雄联唱》中的一段，载人民音乐第三期，全国音协编）的曲调，更具有这一种特点，全曲几乎全用６１３５四个音构成从节奏上来看，似乎也有变化，对比，但唱起来是多么单调和缺乏热情！
    很有可能这些作者以为这样一种曲调进行才是通俗易唱的群众歌曲，他们不从如何体验群众生活，如何把握群众感情这一本质上来理解问题，而仅仅形式地来看问题，显然是不对的。苏维埃作曲家协会秘书长赫连尼可夫同志在论“音乐批评的今日和它的任务”中，有一段话，对我们是很有用处的，他说：
    “……大多数的作曲家对艺术的单纯性的看法太简单了，他们只追求一件作品被大众容易接受，忽视了对于音乐形象精炼工作的重要性。而我们知道，艺术里真正的单纯性，不能用最不费力的方法，消极地利用近代的通俗音乐或过去的音乐表现手法来作自己的音乐手法和形象。
    “当追求音乐的单纯和容易了解时，作曲家无论如何不应该忘掉走向单纯的道路，是在对选定的题材、内容具有深刻地，有机地体验过的感情，和对于现实主义技术的全部掌握。”
    这不正是给我们上面的创作方法所下的对症良药么？
    其次，是滥用民间曲调。民间音乐的宝藏，值得我们珍视，吸收，这是丝毫也不能怀疑的。而且我们在这方面确已作出许多成绩，星海同志的许多作品如《黄河大合唱》、《生产大合唱》等等就是具体的例子。但吸收遗产，应该是批判地、有机地，并且还必须经过适当的加工，赋予新的生命。因为旧的民歌小调是产生在旧的社会基础上，它有好的健康的一面，但其中也有坏的有害的东西。如果我们在运用民间音乐的素材时，不在这一点上引起应有的注意，便必然会产生相反的效果。舒模同志的《美国是这样的国家》（臧克家原词。发表在杭州音协编的《抗美援朝保家卫国》歌集之二）便是这样的一个例子—
    这首曲调是从小调《打牙牌》改编的。曲首标有“蔑视地、仇视地”的表情记号，显然作者是企图用这个曲调来表现群众对美帝蔑视、仇视和愤恨的感情的，但事实是失败了。因为像《打牙牌》那样的调情的小调旋律，绝不可能表现今天中国人民反抗美帝侵略的感情。相反地，倒有轻佻、可笑之感。对于“一条侵略的毒蛇，只想把人来吞下”那样的歌词，作者所创造的音乐语言，竟是跳跃的节奏，与和悦的曲调，这能是美帝形象的正确刻划么？这样的音乐语言是不可能激发群众仇美的感情来的。此外，重复句前面的“哎哟”两个衬字（原词没有，想是曲作者所加），在这里也显得庸俗。可能作者只是为了保有原曲的那种形式，别无用意，但它是太突出了，因而削弱了主题的严肃性。舒模同志过去在运用民歌素材上曾经有过令人满意的成绩，《军民合作》，《你这个坏东西》都是较好的作品，但《美国是这样的国家》这个曲子却是不好的。
    上述现象，是这次歌曲创作中值得严加注意的倾向。为了使音乐创作更能深入的表现出我们这一充满着战斗的热力的时代生活，引向人们朝着更壮丽的明天前进，我们的作曲家就必须更深地体察这一大时代的心声，并更加集中提炼地把它表现出来，这就是我们音乐工作者目前首要的任务。
    我们歌曲创作的产量是相当快而且多的，如果再能在质上提高一步，那么，对于鼓舞人民积极从事于新社会的建设，与增强保卫世界和平的信念，便将产生出更大的力量。
