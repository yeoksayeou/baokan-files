　　Cadre Ge Feng Loses Stance, Shields Landlord
　　Has Been Detained by Competent Authority and Resolved to Punish Severely
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Zhejiang Daily on January 11th: Ge Feng, secretary of the headquarters of the Air Force Preparatory Corps of East China, has been detained by the corps for impersonating the name of the corps, threatening cadres and the masses, attempting to shield the landlord's relatives, and sabotaging land reform.
　　Ge Feng is from Liucun, Zhuangqiao Township, Zhuangqiao District, Cixi County, Zhejiang Province. His third uncle, Ge Wen'an (also known as Ge Zhizong), is an unlawful landlord in Liucun. His family of seven lived off the exploitative income of more than 220 mu of public land that he had seized. During the period of the enemy and puppet regime, he relied on the power of Zhang Zaiyang, the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, and Xie Wenda, the commander of the 10th Division of the puppet Peace Army, to repeatedly seize the land and property of the masses. Ge Haiyun in Liucun had a piece of cemetery land seized by him; in addition to the furniture in Ge Zhida's house being seized by Ge Wen'an, he was also illegally detained for half a year. After liberation, Ge Wen'an still did not repent, and only reported more than 60 mu of the total public land he had seized, in an attempt to evade burdens. In this land reform, Ge Wen'an deliberately messed up the land deeds of the Ge's Ancestral Hall, making it impossible for the peasants to figure out the exact number of land of the ancestral hall. At the same time, he refused to hand over the land deeds of the Xiaxian public land and the three-generation sacrificial land occupied by him, in an attempt to sabotage the land reform. The masses in the village hated Ge Wen'an's crimes of seizing public land and bullying people by virtue of his power. They accused him and demanded that the people's government punish him according to the law. The local people's court, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 1, of the "Regulations on Punishing Unlawful Landlords" of the East China Military and Political Committee, detained Ge Wen'an in preparation for punishing him according to the law.
　　After Ge Feng learned about this, instead of supporting the peasants' just actions in the land reform, he used his revolutionary work post to send four letters in succession on December 5th, 11th, and 12th last year to the Zhuangqiao District Government, the Township Government, the Work Team, and the Village Government, two of which were stolen and affixed with the official seal, impersonating the name of the Air Force Preparatory Corps of East China, in an attempt to intimidate the local cadres and the masses to achieve his shameful purpose of shielding the illegal landlord Ge Wen'an. The letter slandered that the cadres' detention of Ge Wen'an "is really unreasonable," and asked, "I don't know what law he has violated," and demanded "immediate release," "otherwise we will go to the county or provincial government to resolve it," etc. Under his intimidation, the local masses were once panicked and dared not boldly fight against the landlord class.
　　After receiving the report from the Ningbo Special District Farmers Association, the Zhejiang Provincial Farmers Association published an open letter to the Headquarters of the Air Force Preparatory Corps of East China, severely criticizing the behavior of Ge Feng, the secretary of the corps, for protecting the landlord's relatives and intimidating cadres and the masses. The letter stated that Ge Feng's behavior was standing on the side of the landlord, shielding illegal landlords, and resisting the illegal behavior of the peasants. This behavior violated the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers observing the laws and decrees of the people's government. The letter also analyzed the specific situation of the landlord Ge Wen'an in accordance with the provisions of the 15th question of the "Decision on Dividing Rural Class Components" of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and believed that Ge Wen'an's various criminal actions should be punished by the people. After learning about this, the Headquarters of the Air Force Preparatory Corps of East China immediately conducted an inspection of Ge Feng's illegal act of stealing the official seal and shielding the landlord's relatives, and sincerely conducted self-criticism to the Zhejiang Provincial Farmers Association, expressing their admiration for their highly responsible spirit. The corps guaranteed to use the serious lessons of this incident to conduct in-depth land reform education for all personnel, and guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur in the future; and immediately detained Ge Feng, the secretary of the corps, who shielded the landlord and violated discipline and law, and prepared to give him strict disciplinary action.
　　When the Zhejiang Daily published this news, it also published an editorial entitled "Those Who Protect and Shield Landlords Should Be Sanctioned by Law and Discipline." The news and editorial of the Zhejiang Daily were reprinted in full by the Shanghai Liberation Daily on January 23.

　　干部葛风丧失立场包庇地主
    已被主管机关扣押决予严惩
    【本报讯】据一月十一日浙江日报消息：华东空军预科总队司令部秘书葛风，因为假冒该部名义，威胁干部和群众，企图包庇地主亲属，破坏土地改革，已被该部扣押。
    葛风是浙江省慈溪县庄桥区庄桥乡六村人，他的三伯父葛文安（又名葛志纵），是六村的不法地主。全家七口人，依靠霸占公堂田二百二十余亩的剥削收入为生。在敌伪统治时期，他曾依仗伪浙江省长张载阳及伪和平军第十师师长谢文达的势力，屡次霸占群众土地财产。六村葛海云被他霸占墓地一块；葛志大除家中家具被葛文安霸占外，还被他非法扣押半年。解放后，葛文安仍不知改悔，把霸占的全部公堂土地，仅报六十余亩，企图逃避负担。此次土地改革中，葛文安又故意将葛氏宗祠的地契搞乱，使农民无法弄清该宗祠土地确实数目；同时抗不缴出其霸占的公堂霞先公及三代祭祀田的地契，企图破坏土地改革。该村群众对葛文安霸占公堂田，仗势欺人的罪行，恨之入骨，纷纷控告，要求人民政府法办。当地人民法庭根据华东军政委员会“惩办不法地主条例”第五条一款的规定，乃将葛文安扣押，准备依法惩办。
    葛风得知后，非但不支持农民土地改革的正义行动，反而利用他的革命工作岗位，在去年十二月五日、十一日、十二日接连发出信件四份，分致庄桥区政府、乡政府、工作队和村政府，其中有两份盗用公章，假冒华东空军预科总队司令部名义，企图恫吓该地干部和群众，来达到他包庇非法地主葛文安的可耻的目的。信里诬蔑干部扣押葛文安“实无道理”，责问“不知犯了何法”，要求“立即释放”，“否则我们到县或省政府去解决”等语。当地群众在其恐吓下，曾经恐慌起来，不敢大胆地向地主阶级进行斗争。
    浙江省农民协会接获宁波专区农民协会报告后，就发表了一封致华东空军预科总队司令部的公开信，对该部秘书葛风袒护地主亲属、威吓干部群众的行为，作了严厉的批评。信里说：葛风的行为，是站在地主立场上，包庇不法地主，对抗农民的违法行为。这种行为，违反了革命军人遵守人民政府法令的光荣传统。该信并依据中央人民政府政务院关于划分农村阶级成份决定乙项第十五个问题的规定，对地主葛文安的具体情况进行了分析，认为葛文安的种种罪恶行动，完全应该受到人民的惩办。华东空军预科总队司令部在知道这事以后，立即对葛风盗用公章，包庇地主亲属的违法行为进行了检查，并对浙江省农民协会诚恳地进行了自我批评，对他们高度负责的精神表示钦敬。该部保证以这一事件的严重教训，对全体人员进行深入的土地改革教育，保证以后不发生类似事件；并立即将包庇地主违犯法纪的该部秘书葛风扣押，准备给以严格的纪律处分。
    浙江日报在发表这个新闻时，又发表了一篇社论，题目是“袒护包庇地主者，应受法纪的制裁”。浙江日报的新闻和社论，上海解放日报在一月二十三日曾全文转载。
