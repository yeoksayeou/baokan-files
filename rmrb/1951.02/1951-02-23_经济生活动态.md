Economic Life Dynamics
  Agricultural Production in Baicheng County, Heilongjiang Province, Recovers to Pre-War Peak Level
    After three years of the Great Production Movement following land reform, agricultural production in rural Baicheng County, Heilongjiang Province, has recovered to its peak level of 1943 before the Northeast was liberated. According to a survey of three typical villages in the county – Shengli Village, Xinfa Village, and Xinli Village – the advanced Shengli Village's production level in 1949 exceeded that of 1943 by 13 percent. The relatively backward Xinli Village has recovered to over 95 percent of the 1943 level, and Xinfa Village has just recovered to the 1943 level. Farmers have more surplus grain, their living standards have improved, and their purchasing power has significantly increased. The three villages have a total of 87 households with surplus grain, with the largest holding 25 shi. Last year, middle peasants in Xinfa Village used 35 to 50 chi of cloth per person, while poor peasants used 25 to 30 chi, exceeding the pre-liberation level of middle peasants. The number of draught animals and farm tools has also greatly increased. After the land reform, most women participated in agricultural labor, increasing the rural labor force. Each laborer is now responsible for cultivating an average of only 2.2 to 3.9 hectares of land. As a result, cultivation is much more refined than before liberation. In 1943, an average of 18 workdays were spent per hectare, while in 1950, it was 29 workdays.
  Capital Professors' Central-South Land Reform Visiting Group Arrives in Hunan for Observation
    The Central-South China Land Reform Visiting Group, organized by professors from universities in the capital such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, arrived in Changsha on the 13th, comprising 18 members. On the 16th, the group, accompanied by Zhu Fan, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Culture and Education, went to Hengshan County to observe the land reform work being carried out there.
  49 Factories in Jinan Participate in Production Competition
    Since the launch of the patriotic production competition in Jinan City in November last year, statistics up to early January this year show that 49 public and private enterprises and factories in the city, with over 21,600 employees, have joined the movement.
    Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Naiyu, and Zhang Zhenru, workers at the Railway Factory's foundry, improved tools and working methods during the competition, increasing the daily output of Type B brake shoes from 15 boxes to 160 boxes, setting a new national record. The Shandong Tobacco and Alcohol Company's printing plant improved the efficiency of its gelatin printing machine from an average daily output of 19,000 impressions to 24,000 impressions, setting a new city record. Other factories have also achieved excellent results in improving production tools and methods, thereby increasing production efficiency.
  Cooperatives in Central-South China Organize the Exchange of Local Products
    Cooperatives in various parts of the Central-South region have begun to take on the task of organizing the exchange of local and mountain products. Henan, Wuhan, and other places have already made achievements. To organize and promote this work, the Central-South Cooperative Affairs Administration held a second regional business meeting in mid-January. At the meeting, the provinces agreed on mutual ordering methods and signed the first quarter's exchange contracts for local and mountain products. The main materials exchanged are: Central-South Cooperative Warehouses ordering machine-milled rice, tung oil, umbrellas, brown sugar, tree ear fungus, local cloth, wheat, soybeans, and other local and special products from cooperatives in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces; Wuhan City Cooperative ordering native paper and brown sugar from Hunan and Jiangxi, and also ordering granulated white sugar from Guangdong Province Cooperative jointly with Hubei Province Cooperative; Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Cooperatives ordering peanut oil from Henan Province Cooperative Warehouse, while Hubei Province and Wuhan City Cooperatives are ordering sesame oil from the same; Jiangxi Province Cooperative and Hubei Province Cooperative are exchanging paper and gypsum with each other, and the difference is settled in currency.
