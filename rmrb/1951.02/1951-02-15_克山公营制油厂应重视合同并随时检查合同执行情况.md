To the Editor:
　　Keshan Public Oil Factory, due to its careless and irresponsible work, and its failure to value and thoroughly inspect the implementation of contracts by both parties, has caused losses to state property. Last October, the factory signed processing contracts with two private oil shops, Tongxingyuan and Tonghexing, whereby the public oil factory would supply soybeans and the private oil shops would press them into bean cakes. According to the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Processing and Ordering between Public and Private Sectors in the Northeast Region," contracts should be registered with the county's Industry and Commerce Section; however, the public oil factory violated this regulation. The content of the contract it signed was also not specific or clear, and after the contract was signed, it was considered a done deal, with no knowledge of how much was processed each day or whether it could be completed on time. For example, in December, Tongxingyuan claimed to have 290,000 jin of bean cakes in stock, but in reality, the oil shop only had over 180,000 jin. Contracts were not settled upon expiration; for example, the contract signed in December expired more than twenty days ago, and the bean cakes are still stored at the private merchant's location. This gave the private oil shop an opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and they even used 110,000 jin of bean cakes urgently needed by the state for outward sales, profiting from the transaction. It was not until January 21st, when the public oil factory needed bean cakes, that Tongxingyuan oil shop could not deliver them, and the public oil factory then discovered the problem.
　　We believe that the public oil factory, as a state economic department, is not concerned about state and people's property, which has led to great losses, and should conduct a thorough self-criticism and correction.

### 克山公营制油厂应重视合同并随时检查合同执行情况

  　克山公营制油厂应重视合同并随时检查合同执行情况编辑同志：
    克山公营制油厂由于工作马虎不负责，不重视、不深入检查双方对合同的执行情况，使国家财产遭受损失。在去年十月份该厂与同兴源、同和兴两家私人油房订了加工合同，由公营制油厂供给大豆，由私营油房榨成豆饼。按“东北区公私间加工订货管理暂行办法”规定，订合同时应到县工商科登记备案；但该公营油厂违反了这一规定。其所订合同内容，也不具体、不明确，并且订完合同就万事大吉，对一天加工多少，到期能否完成都不知道。如十二月份同兴源说他们库存豆饼二十九万斤，但实际该油房只存十八万多斤。合同到期不结清，如十二月份订的合同已过期二十多天，豆饼还在私商那里存着，这样就使私人油房有机可乘，竟动用国家急用豆饼十一万斤，向外城出卖，从中渔利。到一月二十一日公营油厂要豆饼时，同兴源油房交不出来，这时该公营油厂才发觉这个问题。
    我们认为公营油厂是国家经济部门，对国家人民财产不关心，以至受了很大损失，应很好检讨改正。
