Is it Honorable to be a People's Teacher?
Zhang Ruxin, President of Northeast Normal University

Why are there still so many people unwilling to become people's teachers? The reasons for this are of course varied, but generally speaking, the most common problem is the understanding of the different status and roles of teachers in the old and new societies.

In the old society, except for a very few upper-class reactionary leaders, most teachers, especially those at the middle and lower levels, had no status and were looked down upon. The general social opinion was that being a teacher was the least promising social profession. In terms of待遇, most teachers were poorly paid, lived a hard life, truly unable to eat when hungry or clothe themselves when cold, with no security in life. In terms of地位, they had no political status at all. Many people would rather join the army, enter government offices, do business, or become engineers, lawyers, or doctors, than become teachers. The saying "Having two dou of grain at home, don't be a children's king" precisely represented this thinking. Therefore, in the old society, very few people went to normal schools. Most young people preferred to go to ordinary schools rather than apply to normal schools, which in the eyes of society were specifically set up for "poor children." Even those who entered normal schools were not all willing to do so. An educational researcher named Zheng Hexiang investigated the admission motives of more than 5,000 normal school students under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Less than 30% of them hoped to become primary school teachers, while the others were there because they could spend less money, or they failed to pass the entrance exams for other schools, or they were just temporarily transitioning and would see what happened in the future. This means that they entered normal schools because they had no other choice. In the old society, very few people truly wanted to be teachers and engage in education for a lifetime, and even these people did not receive respect and love from the government, especially those people's democratic educators who wholeheartedly served the working people and their children, such as the great Mr. Tao Xingzhi, who were even more unreasonably oppressed and persecuted by the reactionary ruling group.

Why did teachers have no status in the old society? This is a matter of social system. In the past, China was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial (partially colonial) society, ruled by imperialism, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie. Under this social system, the wealthy and powerful were the aforementioned reactionary ruling groups, while the oppressed and exploited working people, ordinary intellectual workers, and lower-level staff had no social status whatsoever. Labor was generally recognized as a shameful and painful burden, while exploitation, oppression, fraud, and other selfish behaviors, as well as a life of extravagance and parasitism, were considered noble and promising. This was the morality of old China, and also the morality of all old societies built on the exploitation of man by man (such as capitalist countries).

However, in countries where the people have been liberated, the opposite is true. For example, in socialist Soviet Union, the working people have been completely liberated from all exploitation and oppression and have become the masters of the country. A brand new economy, politics, and culture have replaced the old economy, politics, and culture. Therefore, moral concepts have also completely changed. Labor itself has become a "glorious cause, a cause of honor, a cause of valor and a cause of heroism" (Stalin), while exploitation, oppression, fraud, and other selfish behaviors, as well as a life of extravagance and parasitism, are considered shameful, vulgar, and immoral.

In this context, the status of people's teachers engaged in the cultural construction of the new society has also completely changed. People's teachers are no longer oppressed slaves, but "an indispensable part of the great labor army" building a new socialist life (Stalin's congratulatory message to the First All-Union Teachers' Congress). Here, people's teachers are respected by society, their material treatment is improving day by day, and outstanding teachers are often rewarded by the government (the government awards them various glorious medals and decorations, and makes films about the activities of the most outstanding figures among them to educate the people). Many teachers are elected as representatives to local Soviets, and even representatives to the Supreme Soviet. In short, the Soviet government and people's respect and care for teachers for the past thirty-three years has truly realized what Lenin said after the October Revolution: "In our country, the people's teachers should also be elevated to a noble position that has never been reached and is impossible to reach in bourgeois society."

In our China, the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has been overthrown, and a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has been established. New moral concepts are also taking shape. Since the working people are the mainstay of our country and the basic driving force for the construction of new China, labor has become a glorious, courageous, and heroic cause. Consequently, the cause of people's teachers, as a part of the working people and serving the working people, has also become a glorious, courageous, and heroic cause. Because to build a new China, it is necessary to improve the culture of the masses, and people's teachers are shouldering an extremely important task in this regard. Therefore, Chairman Mao pointed out long before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War: "In order to establish a new democratic, independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous China, a large number of people's educators, teachers, people's scientists, engineers, technicians, doctors, journalists, writers, literary figures, artists, and ordinary cultural workers are needed, with the spirit of 'serving the people' and 'integrating with the people,' to engage in arduous work. All these intellectuals, as long as they have made achievements in serving the people, should be respected by the government and society, and regarded as valuable assets of the country and society" ("On Coalition Government"). In fact, in the past, in the liberated areas, many outstanding teachers had been commended by the government, such as primary school teachers Tao Duanyu and Xia Taoran, who were outstanding representatives. As for the lives and待遇 of teachers, although the People's Government has continuously improved them, because our entire country is still in the initial stage of construction and the people's living standards are still very low, people's teachers cannot but live a relatively hard and simple life like the people. This phenomenon of "sharing weal and woe with the people" is precisely the virtue that cadres serving the people should have.

People's teachers in new China shoulder completely different tasks from those in old China. Here, they are not oppressed slaves, not serving the ruling class, but are a part of the people, serving the broad masses of the people. People's teachers are propagators of scientific truth, engineers who enlighten the wisdom of the people. They must instill rich scientific knowledge in the younger generation and eliminate the ideological influence of the feudal comprador bourgeoisie in their minds, and establish the idea of serving the people. They must educate the younger generation to become people with noble morals who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, and love science, so that they can become conscious and active participants and builders of the new democratic society. Therefore, the task of people's teachers is extremely serious, responsible, and glorious. Our judgment of whether a certain job is glorious is based on whether it is needed by the people and whether it is beneficial to the people. This is the only standard and yardstick for scientifically judging problems.

Some people may feel that: people should do great things and achieve great achievements in the world. The correct understanding of this issue should be: building a new China is a great cause, an unprecedented cause for our nation for thousands of years, but this cause cannot be completed without efforts from all sides. In this sense, any revolutionary work is an indispensable part of this great cause. The cause of people's teachers is also a part of this great cause, because it cultivates the younger generation, improves the culture of the masses, and thus promotes the construction of the entire new China. As for whether one can achieve great achievements, that depends on everyone's efforts. In the new society, all undertakings that are beneficial to the people, whether military, economic, political, or cultural and educational, are glorious undertakings, heroic undertakings. Anyone, as long as he serves the people wholeheartedly and honestly, and humbly learns and constantly enriches and improves himself in his work, can make good achievements and be praised by the people. The reason why the people praise such people is because they are not selfish, do not care about personal gains and losses, but are realistic, work hard, and contribute all their wisdom and ability to the cause of the people. Conversely, anyone who despises concrete revolutionary work and only talks about "doing great things and achieving great achievements," or participates in revolutionary work only for personal fame and status, and is concerned about personal gains and losses, but is not realistic and works hard, then he can never have any achievements, nor will he be praised by the people.

In his very meaningful article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao put forward a basic principle of the new morality of serving the people, which is: "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is shown in his boundless sense of responsibility in his work and his boundless warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people…Now everyone commemorates him, but his spirit touches people so deeply, we must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness, starting from this point, we can become people who are of great benefit to the people. A man's ability may be great or small, but with this spirit alone, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from vulgar tastes, a person who is beneficial to the people."

Here, I want to draw everyone's special attention: Although Chairman Mao's article is only a little over a thousand words, its meaning is extremely profound. I hope everyone will read and study it carefully, and use it as a compass for their outlook on life and morality. The essence of this article, I will say it again now, is: as long as you honestly and wholeheartedly serve the people, no matter what work you do, no matter how great or small your ability is, you are a noble person, a moral person, a person who is beneficial to the people. This is true of people's teachers, and it is true of all revolutionary work.

### 做一个人民教师是否光荣？

　　做一个人民教师是否光荣？
    东北师范大学校长  张如心
    为什么一直到现在还有好些人不愿意做一个人民教师呢？这里的原因当然是多种多样的，但是一般地说来，比较普遍存在着的问题首先是对于教师在新旧社会中不同的地位和作用的认识问题。
    在旧社会的教师除了极少数的上层反动的头子以外，一般的特别是中下级教师是没有地位的，是受人轻蔑的。社会上一般的舆论认为教师是最没有出息的社会职业。讲待遇，大多数教师待遇微薄，生活清苦，真是饥不可食，寒不可衣，生活上没有保障；讲地位，政治上完全没有地位。许多人宁愿去搞军队、进衙门、做生意或者当工程师、律师、医生，而不愿意当教员，所谓“家有二斗粮，不当孩子王”这一句俗语正是代表了这种思想。所以在旧社会进师范学校读书的人很少，一般的青年都愿意进普通学校而不乐意去投考师范学校，后者在社会人士的眼光中是专为“贫寒子弟”设立的。就是进了师范学校读书的人也不都是心甘愿意的。有一位教育研究工作者名叫郑鹤翔调查了国民党反动统治下五千多名师范学校学生的入学动机，其中希望当小学教员的还不到百分之三十，其他都是因为来此可以少花钱或者考别的学校没有考上，或者是暂时过渡一下将来再看。这就是说他们进师范学校读书都是因为没有别的出路的结果。在旧社会真正愿意一辈子当教师干教育的人很少很少，而这些人在当时的条件下也得不到政府的尊重和爱戴，尤其是那些全心全意为劳动人民及其子弟服务的人民民主教育家，如伟大的陶行知先生，则更遭到反动统治集团无理的压迫和摧残。
    教师在旧社会为什么没有地位呢？这是一个社会制度问题。中国过去是半封建半殖民地（部分的是殖民地）社会，统治这一社会的是帝国主义、封建势力和官僚买办资产阶级，在这一社会制度下有钱有势的是上述这些反动的统治集团，至若被压迫被剥削的劳动人民与普通的脑力劳动者及下层职员则没有任何社会地位。劳动这一件事情在当时被公认为是耻辱和痛苦的负担，而剥削、压迫、欺诈等损人利己的行为与骄奢淫逸的寄生生活则倒是高尚的有出息的。这就是旧中国的道德，也是一切建筑在人剥削人的旧社会（如资本主义国家）的道德。
    但是，在人民已经获得解放的国家便完全相反。例如在社会主义的苏联，劳动人民已经从一切剥削压迫之下彻底解放出来并成为国家的主人翁，一种崭新的经济、政治、文化代替了旧的经济、政治、文化。因此道德观念也完全改变了。劳动本身已变成了“光荣的事业，荣耀的事业，勇敢的事业和英雄的事业”（斯大林），而剥削、压迫、欺诈等损人利己的行为以及骄奢淫逸的寄生生活则反而认为是可耻的、下流的、不道德的事情。
    在这种情况下，从事于新社会文化建设事业的人民教师的地位也完全改变了。人民教师已不是被压迫的奴仆，而是建设社会主义新生活的“伟大劳动队伍最不可缺少的一部分”（斯大林给苏联第一次教师代表大会的祝词）。在这里人民教师受到了社会上的尊重，他们的物质待遇一天天的提高，优秀的教师经常得到政府的奖励（政府发给他们各种光荣的勋章和奖章，把他们中间最优秀人物的活动拍成电影以教育人民），不少的教师被选举为地方苏维埃的代表，以至最高苏维埃的代表。总之三十三年来的苏联政府和人民对教师的尊重与关怀，真正地实现了列宁在十月革命以后所说的话：“在我国也应当把人民教师提升到资产阶级社会中从未达到，不可能达到的那样高尚的地位。”
    在我们中国，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治已被推倒、以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家已经建立起来。新的道德观念也正在形成中。由于劳动人民是我们国家的主体与新中国建设的基本动力，因此，劳动已成为光荣的、勇敢的和英雄的事业，随之而来作为劳动人民的一部分并为劳动人民服务的人民教师的事业也就成为光荣的勇敢的和英雄的事业。因为要建设新中国就必须提高人民大众的文化，而人民教师在这一方面正担负着极重要的任务。所以毛主席远在抗战胜利以前，就已经指出：“为着建立新民主主义的独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的中国，需要大批的人民的教育家、教师、人民的科学家、工程师、技师、医生、新闻工作者、著作家、文学家、艺术家与普通文化工作者，以“为人民服务”“和人民打成一片”的精神，从事艰巨的工作。一切这些知识分子，只要是在为人民服务中著有成绩的，应受到政府与社会的尊重，把他们看作国家与社会的宝贵财富”（《论联合政府》）。事实上过去在解放区就已经有不少的优秀教师受过政府的表扬，如小学教师陶端予、夏陶然便是其中杰出的代表。至若教师的生活、待遇，虽然人民政府曾不断地加以改善，但是由于目前我们整个国家还处在建国的初期，人民生活水平还很低，因此人民教师就不能不与人民同样过着比较艰苦朴素的生活，这种“与人民同甘苦”的现象，也正是为人民服务的干部应有的美德。
    人民教师在新中国担负着与在旧中国完全不同的任务。他在这里不是被压迫的奴仆，不是为统治阶级服务，而是人民中的一分子，他是为着广大的人民服务的。人民教师是科学真理的宣传者，是启发人民智慧的工程师，他要在培养青年的一代中带给他们以丰富的科学知识并肃清他们头脑中封建买办资产阶级的思想影响，树立为人民服务的思想。他们要把青年一代教育成具有爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学的高尚道德的人物，使他们能够成为新民主主义社会的自觉的积极的参加者和建设者。因此人民教师的任务是异常严肃的、负责的、和光荣的。我们判断某一项工作是否光荣就是要看它对于人民是否需要，是否有利，这是科学地判断问题的唯一标准和尺度。
    有些人也许觉得：人生在世界上应该做大事成大业。关于这一问题正确的理解应该是这样：建设新中国是伟大的事业，是我们的民族几千年来空前未有的大事业，但是这一事业没有各方面的努力是不可能完成的，在这一意义上不论那一项革命工作，都是这一伟大事业不可缺少的部分。人民教师的事业也是这一伟大事业的一部分，因为它培养青年的一代，提高人民大众的文化因而就促进了整个新中国的建设。至若是否能成大业，那是要靠大家努力。在新社会里一切有利于人民的事业，不论是军事、经济、政治、文教，都是光荣的事业，英雄的事业。任何一个人，只要他忠心耿耿老老实实地为人民服务，并在工作中虚心地学习和不断地充实自己与提高自己，那他就可以作出很好的成绩并得到人民的赞扬，而人民之所以赞扬这种人，就是因为他不自私自利，不计较个人得失，而实事求是，埋头苦干，把自己全部智慧、能力贡献给人民的事业。反过来说，任何一个人如果轻视革命的具体工作而只是空口讲“做大事成大业”或者参加革命工作只是从个人名誉地位出发，斤斤于计较个人的得失，而不实事求是埋头苦干，那末他就绝对不可能有任何的成就，也不会得到人民的赞扬。
    毛主席在他的《学习白求恩》这一篇很有意义的文章中曾经提出了为人民服务的新道德的一条基本原则，这就是：“白求恩同志毫无利己专门利人的精神表现在他对工作的极端负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱……现在大家纪念他，可是他的精神感人之深，我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神，从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益人民的人。”
    我在这里要特别提起大家注意：毛主席这一篇文章虽然只是短短一千多字，但是它的意思是异常深长的，希望大家好好地把它阅读钻研一番，并且把它作为自己的人生观、道德观的指南针。这篇文章的精神实质，我现在再说一遍，这就是：只要老老实实全心全意为人民服务，不论做那一项工作，不管他的能力大小，都是高尚的人，有道德的人，有益于人民的人。人民教师是如此，一切革命工作也都是如此。
