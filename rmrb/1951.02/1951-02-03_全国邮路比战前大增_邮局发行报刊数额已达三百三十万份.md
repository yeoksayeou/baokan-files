Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: In 1950, the national postal routes had developed to over 900,000 kilometers, an increase of 60 percent compared to 1937. There are more than 55,000 postal bureaus and offices distributed throughout the country. Excluding the large number of military posts, according to statistics, the number of letters received and sent nationwide in October of last year reached more than 71 percent of the average monthly number of letters sent in 1936. That month, an average of eleven letters were sent per hundred people nationwide, with Shanghai averaging one hundred and eighty letters per hundred people and Beijing averaging one hundred and sixteen letters per hundred people.

Beginning in March of last year, the post office began unprecedented nationwide newspaper and magazine distribution work. To date, the number of newspapers and magazines distributed by the post office has reached 243, accounting for 45 percent of the types of newspapers and magazines nationwide; the number of copies distributed has reached more than 3.3 million, accounting for 69 percent of the number of newspapers and magazines published nationwide. The post office's distribution of newspapers and magazines has not only saved the newspaper offices the cost of establishing distribution organizations but also enabled newspapers and magazines to be widely distributed to the broad masses of the people, allowing some remote counties and vast rural areas that previously could not see newspapers and magazines to now see newspapers. The post office has also accelerated the speed of newspaper distribution. For example, the average speed of the People's Daily being sent to all parts of the country is seven and a half days, with the average speed in the North China region being only one and a half days. In Wuhan, newspapers can be delivered to readers throughout the city within one hour of printing, which is three or four times faster than before.

　　全国邮路比战前大增
    邮局发行报刊数额已达三百三十万份
    【新华社三十一日讯】一九五○年全国邮路已发展至九十余万公里，比一九三七年增加了百分之六十。在分布全国的邮路上，有五万五千多个局所。除数量很大的军邮外，据统计，去年十月份全国收寄信件已达一九三六年每月平均寄发信件数的百分之七十一强。该月平均全国每一百个人寄了十一封信，其中上海每百人合一百八十封信，北京每百人合一百一十六封。
    去年三月开始，邮局开办了前所未有的全国范围的报刊发行工作。到目前为止，由邮局发行的报刊已达二百四十三种，占全国报刊种类的百分之四十五；发行数达三百三十多万份，占全国报刊出版份数的百分之六十九。邮局发行报刊既为报社节省了发行机构，又使报刊广泛地散发到广大的人民群众中去，使过去看不到报刊的某些偏僻县份和广大农村都看到了报纸。邮局并加快了报纸发行的速度。如人民日报发往全国各地的平均速度是七天半，其中华北区平均速度仅一天半。武汉市报纸印出后一小时内就可送到全市读者手上，比从前快了三、四倍。
