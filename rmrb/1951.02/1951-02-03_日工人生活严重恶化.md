Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: New York dispatch: According to a Tokyo dispatch from the New York Worker Daily, under the American occupation policy of indulging trusts, the lives of the Japanese people have been reduced to that of a colony.

　　The exploitation of Japanese workers can be seen in the Mitaka factory belonging to the Fuji Industries Trust near Tokyo. The average wage in the factory is 4,000 to 5,000 yen per person per month, and the highest wage is 8,000 to 9,000 yen. However, the official price of a set of men's clothing is 6,000 to 7,000 yen. A shirt costs more than 1,000 yen. These workers have to pay an average of 700 yen in taxes each month. Therefore, a worker supporting a family of three or four is bound to borrow 2,000 to 3,000 yen each month; a worker with a large family is bound to borrow 5,000 to 6,000 yen. According to surveys, every ordinary worker in the Mitaka factory is in debt of about 10,000 yen. The interest on loans is very high. One worker had to borrow 70,000 yen because his mother had been ill for a long time; he felt that he would never be able to repay the debt in his lifetime. The officially stipulated monthly ration of food is only enough to eat for about ten days. To get extra food, you have to buy it on the black market, but workers cannot afford the high prices manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, many workers leave home early on Sundays to work in the countryside for a day in exchange for a small amount of rice or wheat. Even with this extra work, most families only eat two insufficient meals a day. The living conditions of the workers at the Mitaka factory are also extremely poor, and their families generally only have one dilapidated house. Many houses are leaking and cannot be repaired.

　　The dispatch points out that this situation is not unique to the workers at the Mitaka factory; the situation of the entire Japanese working class is almost the same.

### 日工人生活严重恶化

　　日工人生活严重恶化
    【新华社布拉格二日电】纽约讯：据纽约工人日报的东京通讯称：在放纵托辣斯的美国占领政策下，日本人民的生活已经降低到殖民地的生活了。
    日本工人被剥削的情形，可以在东京近郊富士产业托辣斯所属的三鹰工厂里看得出来。该厂平均工资是每月每人四千到五千日元，最高的工资是八千到九千日元。但是，一套男人衣服的官价就要六千到七千日元。一件衬衣值一千多日元。这些工人每月平均要纳税七百日元。因此，维持一个三四口之家的工人，每月势必借贷两三千日元；家庭人口多的工人，势必借贷五六千日元。据调查表明，三鹰工厂的每一个普通工人都负有一万日元左右的债。贷款的利息是很高的。有一个工人因为他母亲病了很久，不得不借七万日元的债；他认为他一辈子也还不清这笔债了。官方规定的一个月的口粮，只够吃十天左右。要额外的食粮就得从黑市上买，但是工人出不起暗中操纵的奸商抬高的价格。因此，许多工人星期日一清早就离家到乡下去做一天工，以换取少许稻米或小麦。即使做这种额外的工作，大多数家庭每天只吃两餐不饱的饭。三鹰工厂工人的住的条件也极恶劣，他们的家庭一般只有一间东倒西歪的房屋。许多房屋都漏雨，已无法修理。
    通讯指出：这种情况不只是三鹰工厂工人所特有的，整个日本工人阶级的情况差不多都是如此。
