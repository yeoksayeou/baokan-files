　　Last Year's National Petroleum Industry Achieved Remarkable Results in Key Recovery Efforts
    [By Our Correspondent] In 1950, the national petroleum industry was restored with a focus on key areas. The annual crude oil production exceeded the original plan by 13 percent, an increase of 35 percent compared to 1949. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, the gasoline production rate (i.e., the ratio of gasoline refined from crude oil) increased from 36 percent in 1949 to 49 percent in 1950, resulting in a 17 percent increase in total gasoline production in 1950 compared to 1949. In terms of exploration, in 1950, over 3,000 square kilometers of geological surveys and over 800 square kilometers of key surveys were completed, and a number of new oil fields were discovered. In 1950, the Ministry of Fuel Industries also trained more than 600 technical personnel for the petroleum industry, preparing for large-scale construction. Due to overcoming many material and technical difficulties, and with the help of Soviet experts, many abandoned wells were revived last year.

　　去年全国石油工业重点恢复成就显著
    【本报讯】一九五○年全国石油工业已有重点地恢复起来。全年原油产量超过原计划百分之十三，比一九四九年增加了百分之三十五。由于全体职工的努力，汽油生产率（即自原油中炼出汽油的比率）已由一九四九年的百分之三十六提高到一九五○年的百分之四十九，因而一九五○年汽油总产量比一九四九年增加了百分之十七。在探勘方面，一九五○年完成了三千多平方公里的地质调查和八百多平方公里的重点勘测，发现了若干新的油田。一九五○年，燃料工业部还培养了六百余名石油工业的技术人员，为大规模的建设作了准备。由于克服了许多器材上和技术上的困难，同时得到苏联专家的帮助，许多废井去年已复活起来。
