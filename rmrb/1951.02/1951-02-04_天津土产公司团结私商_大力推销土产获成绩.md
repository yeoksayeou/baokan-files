　　Tianjin Native Produce Company Unites Private Merchants
    Vigorously Promotes Native Produce and Achieves Success
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Last year in the second half of the year, the Tianjin Native Produce Company played a certain role in uniting private merchants to vigorously promote native produce, and gained some experience.
    In order to actively open up sales channels for native produce, in addition to strengthening the organization of export business, the company focused on the operation of industrial raw materials and consumer goods. Among them, the sale of native produce industrial raw materials alone accounted for 68 percent of the company's domestic sales volume in the past six months. Among them, sulfur, natural alkali, alum, tobacco leaves, asbestos, gypsum, white hemp, rosin and other eight commodities totaled more than five million jin in sales. The increase in sales enabled previously stockpiled stale and slow-moving goods to find a market. For example, medicinal materials were previously sluggish, but by October of last year, the sale of Astragalus to Zhengzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou and other places reached 150,000 jin, which was unprecedented in recent years. Chinese prickly ash had been sluggish for the past few years, but after the company took the initiative to open up sales channels to the Northeast and other places, the supply was insufficient to meet demand. In order to meet the needs of citizens' consumption, a large number of pickled mustard tubers, bamboo goods and Jiangxi oranges were transported from the Southwest and East China, which were quite popular with citizens.
    In order to expand the sales channels for native produce, it is also very important for state-owned native produce companies to take care of private merchants in terms of management and prices. In order to facilitate the wholesale of medicinal materials by various drug merchants in the city, the Native Produce Company moved its medicinal materials department to the commercial district of medicinal materials, and as a result, the number of merchants dealing with the medicinal materials department increased from less than 50 to more than 270. In order to promote the export of peach kernels, straw braid and medicinal materials, small groups were formed jointly with private merchants to carry out promotion. In terms of price control, all kinds of native produce took into account the reasonable profits of production, transportation and sales. Moreover, the company reduced its original 100-plus kinds of commodities to 42, which further encouraged the operating confidence of private merchants.
    The company's experience in operating native produce in the past six months has proved that actively understanding the needs of all parties for native produce can expand sales channels. Because understanding the needs of native produce in advance can strengthen planning, thereby avoiding the accumulation of funds. For example, the company adopted the method of transporting as much prickly ash and other commodities as it sold, making the use of funds flexible; on the contrary, in the past, blind operation of rhubarb, yam, radix scrophulariae and other native products resulted in accumulation and sluggish sales. At the same time, it is also very important to grasp the seasonality of native produce and appropriate selling prices and quality. For example, honeysuckle and other goods transported from East China and Central South could not be sold because they missed the season; Xu Chang tobacco leaves were difficult to promote due to high purchase prices and poor quality.

　　天津土产公司团结私商
    大力推销土产获成绩
    【本报讯】天津市土产公司去年下半年在团结私商大力推销土产上，曾起了一定作用，并取得了一些经验。
    该公司为积极打开土产销路，除加强组织出口业务外，并着重工业原料和消费品的经营。其中，仅经售土产工业原料，即占该公司半年来国内销售总量的百分之六十八。其中硫磺、天然碱、明矾、烟叶、石棉、石膏、白麻、松香等八种商品，共销售五百余万斤。由于销售量增加，使过去积压的陈货、冷货都找到了销路。如药材过去滞销，但至去年十月份，销往郑州、汉口、广州、汕头等地的黄耆即达十五万斤，为近数年来所未有。花椒过去几年来都滞销，该公司主动向东北等地打开销路后，亦感供不应求。为适应市民消费的需要，曾由西南、华东运来大批的榨菜、竹货及江西橘子等，颇得市民欢迎。
    为扩大土产销路，国营土产公司从经营和价格上照顾私商也是很重要的。为便利市内各药商批发药材，土产公司将所属药材部迁入药商业区内，结果药材部的往来商户，由原来不足五十户增至二百七十余户。为推广桃仁、草帽辫及药材的出口，分别联合私商组成小组，进行推销。在价格掌握上，各种土产均照顾产、运、销三方面合理利润。并且该公司由原经营商品百余种缩小到四十二种，更加鼓励了私商的经营信心。
    半年来，该公司经营土产的经验证明：主动了解各方面土产的需要，才能扩大销路。因为事先了解土产的需要，才能加强计划性，从而避免了资金的积压。如该公司运销花椒等商品，采取销多少运多少的办法，使资金使用灵活；相反，过去盲目经营大黄、山药、元参等土产，结果积压、滞销。同时，掌握土产的季节性和适当的售价与质量也很重要。如华东、中南运来的银花等，即因错过了季节而销不出去；许昌烟叶因来货价高、质量次，推销也感困难。
