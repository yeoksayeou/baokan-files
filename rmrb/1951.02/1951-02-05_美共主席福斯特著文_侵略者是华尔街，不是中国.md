Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 4th: The New York Daily Worker published an essay by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, on January 26th, entitled "The Aggressor is Wall Street, Not China." The article stated in part: Even a cursory examination of the situation in the Far East makes it clear that it is the United States government, not the People's China, that is guilty of military aggression. Even excluding the original American acts of aggression in Korea, the United States has carried out a series of other acts of aggression that have clearly damaged China and undermined its territorial integrity. The first of these acts of aggression was the seizure of the island of Taiwan, which has belonged to China for many centuries.

Long before the Chinese People's Volunteers appeared in Korea, the U.S. Air Force had repeatedly bombed Chinese villages north of the Yalu River; this action constituted a second premeditated act of aggression. The U.S. government says that these bombings were accidental, due to pilots not knowing clearly the territory they were bombing; but, on the contrary, the bombings were clearly pre-planned to intimidate the Chinese people. Imagine the kind of rebuke and retaliatory action the United States would take if Chinese pilots bombed even one American village!

The third unprovoked act of aggression by American imperialism against China occurred when MacArthur's army rushed north of the 38th parallel to occupy territory along the Manchurian border. The Chinese people were fully justified in viewing this vigorous advance as a direct threat to their country. For wasn't the United States precisely at that time seizing China's Taiwan and repeatedly bombing Chinese villages? Is it not a well-known fact that MacArthur—a close ally and supporter of Chiang Kai-shek—was then plotting to rekindle civil war in China?

The Chinese people—especially because they have seen the many aggressions that the United States has committed against them—had no choice but to take steps to defend their threatened national interests. It is in this justified context that large numbers of Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the border and shared weal and woe with the Korean army. To call this act aggression after the Chinese people have suffered various provocations and damages from the United States is to turn right and wrong upside down and confuse black and white.

The American conspiracy to have the United Nations condemn China as an aggressor, thereby laying the foundation for capitalists to launch an all-out war against China at an early date, is the greatest of all American aggressions against the People's China. But carrying out this malicious aggression has proven not to be an easy task. The people of Europe and Asia are absolutely unwilling to be dragged into an Asian war, a prelude to a third world war, solely for the purpose of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for Wall Street.

### 美共主席福斯特著文“侵略者是华尔街，不是中国”

　　美共主席福斯特著文
    “侵略者是华尔街，不是中国”
    【新华社布拉格四日电】纽约工人日报一月二十六日刊登美国共产党主席福斯特所作的论文，题为“侵略者是华尔街，不是中国”。该文略称：即使粗粗地研究一下远东局势，也可以清楚地看出：犯有军事侵略之罪的是美国政府，而不是人民中国。即使不算原来美国在朝鲜的侵略行为，美国也进行了一连串的其他侵略行为，这些侵略行为显然损害了中国，并破坏了中国的领土完整。其中第一次侵略就是攫取了许多世纪以来都是属于中国的台湾岛。
    远在中国人民志愿军在朝鲜出现以前，美国空军已屡次轰炸鸭绿江以北的中国村庄；这种行为构成了第二次处心积虑的侵略。美国政府说，这种轰炸是偶然的，是由于飞行人员没有弄清楚他们所轰炸的领土；但是，相反地，这种轰炸显然是经过事先筹划用以恫吓中国人民的。试想中国飞行员只要轰炸美国的一个村庄，美国会进行怎样的斥责和采取怎样的报复行动呢！
    美帝国主义者对中国的第三次无端侵略，发生在麦克阿瑟的军队在他向三八线以北猛冲以占领沿满洲边界的领土的时候。中国人民完全有理由认为这种猛烈的推进是对他们的国家的直接威胁。因为美国难道不正就是在那时攫取了中国的台湾岛并一再轰炸中国的村庄吗？麦克阿瑟——蒋介石的亲密的盟友和支持者——当时确实是在阴谋策划重新在中国掀起内战，这难道不是人所共知的事实吗？
    中国人民——特别因为他们看到美国对他们进行的许多侵略——除了采取步骤保卫他们的受到威胁的国家利益以外，没有别的路可走。正是在这种有道理的情况下，大批中国人民志愿军越过疆界和朝鲜军队共当患难。在中国人民遭受美国的各种挑衅和损害以后还把这种行为称做侵略，这是颠倒是非，混淆黑白。
    美国使联合国谴责中国为侵略者从而为资本家早日对中国发动全力的战争奠定基础的阴谋，是美国对人民中国的一切侵略中的最大的侵略。但是进行这种恶毒的侵略已经证明不是一件轻而易举的事了。欧洲和亚洲的人民决不愿完全为了给华尔街火中取栗而向被拖进第三次世界大战的前奏的亚洲战争里去。
