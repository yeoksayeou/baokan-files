The meeting began with a report by Park Heon-yeong, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Supreme Command of the People's Army, on the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. He detailed the glorious path the Korean People's Army had taken in the past three years, especially the heroic dedication and unwavering perseverance it had demonstrated in the Fatherland Liberation War against the American imperialist aggressors and their running dog, the traitorous Syngman Rhee bandit gang. He pointed out that under the leadership of General Kim Il Sung, the wise leader of the Korean people, and the Korean Workers' Party, and with the support of all the Korean people, the People's Army had developed into a powerful force in just three years, effectively fulfilling the glorious mission of defending the independence of the motherland and the freedom and happiness of the people. Today, the People's Army is fighting side by side with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army to pursue and annihilate the enemy. He called on all the Korean people to strive for the final victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War and to make unremitting efforts to strengthen the front lines and consolidate the rear.

After the report, Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myung-hee, on behalf of the Cabinet of the Republic and the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and Park Jeong-ae, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, delivered congratulatory speeches successively. Then, amid warm applause from the audience, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took the stage to deliver a congratulatory speech. He first extended warm congratulations and respect to the Korean People's Army and Supreme Commander General Kim Il Sung on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Army. He then said, "The Korean People's Army has shown unparalleled heroism and tenacity in the war against the American aggressors and the Korean traitorous Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and has won the support and assistance of the people of the world." He pointed out, "The Chinese people and the Korean people are closely related and interdependent. In order to defeat our common enemy – American imperialism – our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side and have already achieved great victories. In the future, we must unite even more closely with the Korean People's Army and fight together to eliminate the American aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and to liberate the whole of Korea. We firmly believe that the unity of the Korean and Chinese people is an invincible force. The aggressive ambitions of American imperialism will inevitably be thoroughly defeated." Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted messages of respect to General Kim Il Sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin amid warm applause.
