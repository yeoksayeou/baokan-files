　　Xinjiang's Economic and Cultural Construction Receives Great Assistance from the Soviet Union
    [Xinhua News Agency] Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance a year ago, Xinjiang Province, which borders the Soviet Union, has received much friendly assistance from the Soviet Union in its economic and cultural construction.

    With the help of the Soviet Union, Xinjiang Province's foreign trade has been restored and greatly developed over the past year. Farmers and herdsmen sold large quantities of local products such as cattle, sheep, sheepskins, wool, sheep casings, camel hair, and animal skins, directly earning the equivalent of 156 billion yuan in Renminbi. The lives of farmers and herdsmen, who had been impoverished for many years, have now improved initially. Many herdsmen who had worn sheepskin coats year-round now have sewn new clothes and have enough sugar and tea. At the same time, through the export of local products, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have exchanged for industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, medical equipment, and transportation vehicles from the Soviet Union, which has helped the development of industry and agriculture in Xinjiang. In order to completely eradicate the serious locust plagues that have plagued Xinjiang for many years, the Soviet government, at the invitation of the Chinese government, sent a locust control investigation team headed by Chulman in August of last year. They conducted more than two months of investigation and research in the locust plague areas of Xinjiang and formulated specific steps and methods for eradicating locusts. They also held a short-term training class in Dihua, training more than 50 locust control cadres in Xinjiang, which greatly helped to eradicate the locust plagues in Xinjiang. The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Ferrous and Rare Metals Company and the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company combines advanced Soviet technology with Xinjiang's boundless resources, which plays a significant role in Xinjiang's economic construction and national defense construction.

    In terms of culture, the Soviet Union published approximately 500,000 copies of books in Russian, Chinese, Uyghur, and Kazakh, including various works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism," and more than 2 million copies of newspapers, magazines, and pictures in various languages to meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In addition, the Soviet side also printed 1,284,000 copies of primary school textbooks in Russian, Chinese, Uyghur, and Kazakh for the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, so that the new generation of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang can quickly receive New Democratic education. Soviet films with high educational significance have also been screened throughout Xinjiang through local cinemas and projection teams. The Soviet literary and art workers delegation that visited Xinjiang in November of last year performed a total of 66 shows throughout Xinjiang, with an audience of more than 370,000 people. They also introduced the achievements and experiences of the various ethnic groups in Soviet Central Asia in culture and art through lectures, which greatly encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to build cultural undertakings. The Xinjiang branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which has more than 30,000 members, has received a large number of film projectors, radios, musical instruments, gramophones, slide projectors, and books, pictures, newspapers, and magazines donated by the Soviet Union over the past year. The association's photo exhibition introducing the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet Union attracted an audience of 140,000 people.

　　新疆经济文化建设得到苏联很大帮助
    【新华社讯】中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一年来，在我国与苏联接壤的新疆省在经济、文化事业建设方面，得到了苏联很多友谊的帮助。
    新疆省的对外贸易去年一年来在苏联的帮助下，得到了恢复和很大发展。农牧民销出牛、羊、羊皮、羊毛、羊肠、驼毛及兽皮等大批土产，直接收入折合人民币一千五百六十亿元；多年来生活穷苦的农牧民，现在初步改善了生活。许多长年穿着光板皮袄的牧民缝了新衣，有了足够的糖和茶。同时，经过土产外销，新疆各族人民又从苏联换得工业设备、农业机械、医药器材和交通工具，帮助了新疆工农业的发展。为了彻底扑灭新疆历年来严重的蝗虫灾害，苏联政府应中国政府的邀请，于去年八月派来以楚尔曼为首的扑蝗考察团，在新疆蝗灾区进行了两月余的调查研究工作，制定了扑灭蝗虫的具体步骤和方法；并在迪化举办短期训练班，培养了新疆扑蝗干部五十余人，对扑灭新疆的蝗虫灾害，给了很大帮助。中苏有色金属及稀有金属公司与中苏石油公司的成立，使苏联的先进技术与新疆的无限富藏结合起来，对新疆的经济建设与国防建设都起着极大的作用。
    在文化方面，苏联以俄、汉、维吾尔、哈萨克四种文字出版了约五十万册书籍，包括马恩列斯各种著作及毛主席的《论人民民主专政》、刘少奇副主席的《论国际主义与民族主义》及各种文字的报纸杂志图片二百余万份，供应新疆各族人民的需要。此外，苏联方面并代新疆省人民政府印制了一百二十八万四千册俄汉维哈四种文字的小学课本，使新疆各民族新的一代能迅速接受新民主主义的教育。具有高度教育意义的苏联影片，亦经过各地电影院、放映队，在全疆各地放映。去年十一月间来新疆访问的苏联文艺工作者代表团，在全疆各地共演出六十六场，观众达三十七万余人，并以讲座方式介绍了苏联中亚各民族在文化艺术上的成就和经验，给新疆各族人民建设文化事业极大鼓舞。拥有三万多会员的中苏友好协会新疆分会，一年来收到苏联赠送的大批电影放映机、收音机、乐器、留声机、幻灯放映机及书籍、图片、报纸、杂志等。该会主办的介绍苏联三十三周年的照片展览，观众达十四万人。
