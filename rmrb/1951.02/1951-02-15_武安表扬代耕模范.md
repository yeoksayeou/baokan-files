    Wu'an Commends Model Substitute Farmers
    In Wu'an County, Hebei Province, during the 1950s work of substitute farming, many model villages and model groups who loved the families of martyrs and military personnel were discovered. In the nine districts, villages like Xijun, Beiguo, and Hongmen built 850 embankments for the families of martyrs and military personnel. Xijun village alone accumulated 3,500 loads of fertilizer for them. In Junhe village in the first district and Shuangyu Song village in the second district, the land of the families of martyrs and military personnel saw increased yields because of the good substitute farming. In Shierzhuang village in the eighth district, Ren Fuzhen farmed land for a military family, doing it earlier and better than she farmed her own land, and ensuring that fertilization and weeding met standards, guaranteeing the yield of the military family's land. The Sun Fenggui substitute farming group in Xijun village ensured three "mores" when substitute farming for military families: more tilling, more weeding, and more fertilizing, thus improving the living standards of the military families they assisted.
    These model villages and model individuals, who are enthusiastically substitute farming for the families of martyrs and military personnel, are worthy of commendation and worthy of learning from everywhere. Wu'an County has issued a circular to commend them.

    武安表扬代耕模范
    河北省武安县，一九五○年代耕工作中，发现了不少热爱烈属军属的代耕模范村和模范小组。该县九区西峻、北果、红门等八个村，代烈属军属垒堰八百五十处，西峻一村代烈属军属积肥三千五百驮。一区均河村，二区双玉宋村，烈属军属的地都因为代耕的好，而增加了产量。八区史二庄任富珍代军属耕地，比自己的地耕得早，耕得好，而且施肥、锄草都够标准，保证了军属土地的产量。西峻村孙风贵代耕小组，在对军属代耕时，保证做到了耕、锄、上粪三多，受代耕的军属生活因之上升。
    这些热心为烈属军属代耕的模范村和模范人物，是值得表扬并值得各地学习的，对此，武安县曾通报表扬。
