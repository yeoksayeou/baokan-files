　　Neglecting Improvements in Production Conditions
    Qingdao Knitting Factory Experiences a Sharp Increase in Defective Products
    The state-owned Qingdao Knitting Factory, in the midst of the patriotic production campaign, has neglected product quality, leading to a sharp increase in defective products recently. Looking at the figures: in September of last year, defective products accounted for only 8.66 percent, increasing to 11.07 percent in October, continuing to rise to 15 percent in December, and then skyrocketing to 20.7 percent in January of this year. Defective products are mainly manifested in oil stains, dirt, dropped stitches, small button losses, uneven colors, and exposed fluff.

    The reasons for the increase in defective products are as follows:

    (1) The factory leadership does not care about production and does not understand the production situation. When the weather turned cold in winter, the heating equipment in the workshops was not improved in time. When the machine oil froze, the machines could not turn smoothly, and there were more oil stains on the materials. Before the Spring Festival, the leadership was busy with cultural and recreational activities and did not educate everyone in time to eliminate defective products. Although the chairman of the trade union had raised opinions to the administration, the administration did not improve in time, and the trade union did not supervise further.

    (2) Poor raw material supply. The needles used for knitting are of very poor quality. Some needles are already unusable in private factories. Dropped stitches are caused by poor needles. Some yarns are of very poor quality; because they are uneven in thickness, they cannot pass through the needle holes, resulting in small button losses. Due to insufficient fuel, the temperature in the drying room is low, and as a result, the materials have to be dried in the open air. The intrusion of coal ash and dust makes it easy to get the products dirty.

    (3) The standards for defective products are not clearly defined. The inspection is not strict. Those responsible for inspecting defective products often think, "This small problem doesn't matter," and often let them pass easily.

    Now the factory leadership has begun to pay attention to this issue, and the Party, government, and trade union are holding meetings to study how to eliminate defective products.

### 不注意改善生产条件  青岛针织厂次品激增

　　不注意改善生产条件
    青岛针织厂次品激增
    国营青岛针织厂，在爱国主义生产竞赛中，忽视产品质量，以致近来次等品激剧增加。从数字上来看：去年九月份次等品仅占百分之八点六六，十月份增为百分之十一点零七，十二月份继续增为百分之十五，今年一月份竟激剧上升至百分之二十点七。次等品主要是表现在油迹、脏污、滑针、小掉扣、色不匀、露毛等方面。
    造成次等品的原因有下列几点：
    （一）工厂领导上不关心生产，对生产情况不了解。入冬天气寒冷，但没有及早改善工场暖气设备。机油冻了，机器转不动，料子上的油迹就多起来。在春节前，领导上又忙着搞文化娱乐活动，没有及时教育大家消灭次等品。工会主席虽曾向行政提出过意见，但行政上没有及时改进，工会也没有再加以督促。
    （二）原料供应差。针织用的针，质量很坏，有些针是在私人厂子里都已经不能用了的。滑针就是由于针不好而产生的。有的纱质量很差，因为粗细不匀，通不过针孔，结果就要出小掉扣。由于燃料不足，烘房温度低，结果料子只好露天晒，煤灰、风尘的侵袭，产品很容易就弄脏了。
    （三）次等品标准订的不明确。在检查时又不严格。负责检查次等品的人，常存在：“这点小毛病不要紧”，往往轻易放过去。
    现在工厂领导上已开始重视这一问题，党政工正开会研究消灭次品。
