    Cotton Mills That Violate the Government's
    Unified Cotton Yarn Purchase Decision Should Be Thoroughly Investigated

To the Editor:

    The Central Financial and Economic Commission's decision to implement the unified purchase of cotton yarn, issued on January 4th, is of great significance for supplying the people with clothing and stabilizing prices. The people and the textile industry across the country have unanimously and enthusiastically supported it. However, some individual cotton mills are not complying with government decrees and are still privately selling cotton yarn on the market. For example, the Liuzhou sales office of the Hunan Textile Factory sold six pieces of 14-count Pagoda yarn in the Liuzhou market on January 19th; and the Hunan Anjiang Cotton Mill also sold cotton yarn in the Changde market on January 17th. This kind of illegal behavior should be publicly criticized. I also suggest that local industrial and commercial authorities should thoroughly investigate similar illegal behaviors to implement government decrees.

    应彻查不遵守政府
    统购棉纱决定的纱厂编辑同志：
    一月四日中央财委会颁布统购棉纱的决定，对于供给人民衣着和稳定物价有重大意义，全国人民和纺织界无不一致的热烈拥护。但有个别的纱厂，不遵守政府法令，仍然在市场上私行销售棉纱。如湖南纺织厂柳州推销处于一月十九日在柳州市场卖出十四支宝塔纱六件；又如湖南安江纱厂于一月十七日在常德市场也卖出棉纱。这种违法行为，应该公开检讨。我并建议各地工商机关，应予彻查类似这样违法行为，以贯彻政府法令。
