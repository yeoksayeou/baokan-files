　　At the UPU Executive Council Meeting
　  U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy Fails Again

    【Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 12th】Cairo dispatch: At the joint meeting of the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union and the International Air Transport Association held in Cairo, the American representative, disregarding the resolution passed at the opening of the meeting recognizing the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese representative to attend the meeting, on February 1st, using the excuse that the United Nations had illegally passed a resolution slandering our country as an "aggressor," once again demanded the deprivation of the seat of our People's Republic of China.

    By the 5th day of the meeting, the Czechoslovak representative proposed that the American proposal not be discussed and that the seat of the People's Republic of China should be maintained. After a secret vote, the meeting passed the Czechoslovak proposal by a majority. The American conspiracy once again suffered a shameful defeat.

　　在万国邮联执委会议上
　  美帝阴谋又告失败
    【新华社十二日讯】开罗消息：在开罗举行的万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会与国际航空运输协会的联席会议上，美国代表竟不顾会议在开幕时即已通过承认我中华人民共和国为出席会议的唯一合法的中国代表的决议，而又于二月一日借口联合国已非法通过诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的决议，再度要求剥夺我中华人民共和国的席位。
    至五日会议时，捷克斯洛伐克代表提议不讨论美国的提案，中华人民共和国代表的席位应予保持。会议经秘密投票后，以大多数通过了捷克斯洛伐克的提议。美国的阴谋再度遭到了可耻的失败。
