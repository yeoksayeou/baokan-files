　　Resolutely Oppose the American Aggression Conspiracy of Re-arming Japan
    Demonstrations and Parades by 240,000 People from All Walks of Life in Chongqing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 22nd] More than 240,000 workers, residents, women, and religious figures in Chongqing City held demonstrations and parades respectively to oppose the American imperialist conspiracy to re-arm Japan. More than 70,000 workers in the city held a demonstration parade on the 20th. Participants included workers from railways, seamen, municipal administration, transportation, postal and telecommunications, shop assistants, and other industries. They all held high patriotic covenants, pledges, and protest letters written in large characters. Among the parading crowds were many model workers and workers who had suffered persecution by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Zhang Xianyi, a representative of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, called on workers at the parade rally to further launch patriotic production competitions. Fifteen trade unions in the city jointly telegraphed their worker brothers in Asian countries, calling on the Asian working class to unite and fight to the end to completely oppose the American imperialist aggression conspiracy.
    More than 120,000 urban residents held a similar demonstration parade on the 19th. In the parade ranks were housewives holding children, and old men and women in their fifties and sixties. Residents who had suffered heavy losses in the frenzied bombing by the Japanese invaders held up shocking pictures of the Japanese bombing and shouted to avenge their dead relatives. Sun Deyuan, a woman whose right hand was blown off in the Japanese bombing on May 3, 1939, raised the flag against the United States' rearmament of Japan with her left hand. Deputy Mayor Hu Zi'ang called on the parading citizens at a rally to continue to participate in large and small gatherings in various streets after the meeting to carry out in-depth patriotic propaganda and education.
    More than 50,000 women from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Chongqing City held demonstration parades in separate districts on the 18th. Participants included female workers, female students, female cadres from military and government agencies, and housewives. Among them, 150 Hui women wore white prayer caps with the red inscription "Long Live the Unity of All Brotherly Nationalities" in Arabic script. The parade in the urban area was reviewed by Deputy Mayor Cao Diqiu and Liao Suhua, director of the Southwest Women's Work Committee. On the 17th, 1,400 patriotic Catholics and Christians in Chongqing City also held a rally and demonstration parade against the United States' rearmament of Japan. Chen Chonggui, president of the Chongqing Theological Seminary, and Chen Guangpu, a priest of the Ruose Church of Catholicism, unanimously stated in their speeches at the meeting that Christians and Catholics will definitely join the people of the whole country to resolutely oppose the American aggression conspiracy to re-arm Japan.
