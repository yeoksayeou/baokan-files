　　The Great Year of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance
　  -- Written for the Soviet "Pravda"
　　Zhou Enlai
    Today marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Because this treaty has enormous world historical significance, the Chinese people regard this day as one of the most memorable days.
    The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a fraternal alliance against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace. China and the Soviet Union are the two most powerful countries in the world, and possess seven hundred million united people. Their forming a solid alliance makes them an invincible force in the world. The formation of this force not only greatly strengthens the advantage of the world peace and democracy camp, but also seriously strikes the imperialist bloc’s policy of aggression and war in the East.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance stipulates that the two contracting parties guarantee to jointly strive to take all necessary measures to prevent the resurgence of aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other country directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in acts of aggression. The treaty stipulates that the two contracting parties will fully contribute their strength to ensuring world peace and security, and will consult with each other on all major international issues concerning the common interests of China and the Soviet Union, based on the interests of consolidating peace and universal security. Over the past year, these provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance have not only had a significant impact on the great cause of opposing imperialist aggression in the East and defending peace in the Far East and the world, but will also have an even more significant impact in the future.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance also stipulates that the two contracting parties guarantee to jointly achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, after mutual agreement and with other Allied nations during the Second World War. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, are eager to conclude a joint peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, but the basis for the treaty must be fully in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan agreed upon and passed by the Far Eastern Commission countries on June 19, 1947. We believe that only a peace treaty with Japan based on these international agreements can democratize Japan, eliminate Japan's aggressive forces and prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, and develop Japan's peaceful industries, which will benefit the improvement of the lives of the Japanese people. A democratized Japan without the collusion and control of internal and external aggressive forces will be conducive to peace and security in Asia. However, the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism does not think so. They are not reconciled to the failure of their policy of aggression in the East, and are conspiring to conduct a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearming Japan, and attempting to use Japanese territory as a base and the Japanese people as cannon fodder in order to continue and expand their heinous acts of aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and interference in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. This conspiracy by US imperialism violates all international agreements and overturns the basis for a joint peace treaty with Japan, which is what the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance firmly opposes, and is also what the Asian people, including the Japanese people, firmly oppose. It can be asserted that if US imperialism persists in its own way, it will eventually end in failure.
    The more the Sino-Soviet alliance is hated by a very small number of imperialist plunderers, the more it is supported by the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving and justice-loving people in the world, and therefore the more consolidated it becomes.
    In the past year, our great friendly nation has sincerely and faithfully fulfilled the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its related agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, the agreement on loans to the People's Republic of China, and other agreements on Sino-Soviet economic cooperation and trade, and has given the Chinese people generous assistance, greatly helping our country's economic recovery and development. The Chinese people warmly thank Marshal Stalin and the Soviet government for this great friendship. No matter how violently the imperialist aggressors rage, the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is becoming closer day by day. There is no doubt that the fraternal friendship of the great people of China and the Soviet Union, who account for one-third of mankind, for the purpose of peace and progress, will bring unlimited youthful hope to the world threatened by imperialist war plans.
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Marshal Stalin!
    Long live the great Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!

　　中苏友好同盟伟大的一年
　  ——为苏联《真理报》作
　　周恩来
    今天，是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的一周年。由于这个条约具有巨大的世界历史意义，中国人民把这一天看作最值得纪念的日子之一。
    中苏两国的伟大同盟，是反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的兄弟同盟。中苏两国是世界上两个强大国家，并拥有七万万团结一致的人民，他们结为坚固的同盟，就成为世界上不可战胜的力量。这个力量的结成，不仅大大地加强了世界和平民主阵营的优势，并且使帝国主义集团在东方的侵略政策和战争政策遭受严重的打击。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约规定：缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。条约中规定：缔约国双方将为确保世界和平与安全充分贡献其力量，并根据巩固和平与普遍安全的利益，对有关中苏两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题，均将进行彼此协商。一年以来，中苏友好同盟互助条约的这些规定，不但已经在反对帝国主义在东方的侵略及保卫远东和世界和平的伟大事业中产生了重大的影响，而且必将在今后产生更为重大的影响。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约并规定：缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。中国人民与苏联人民一样亟愿尽速订立共同对日和约，但和约的基础，必须完全依照开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会各国所同意通过的对投降后日本之基本政策。我们认为：只有以这些国际协定为基础的对日和约，才能使日本民主化，才能清除日本的侵略势力而防止日本帝国主义的再起，才能发展日本的和平工业而有利于日本人民生活的改善。一个没有内外侵略势力勾结和控制的民主化的日本，才能有利于亚洲的和平与安全。但是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团却不是这样想法。他们不甘心于对东方侵略政策的失败，正在阴谋进行对日片面媾和，重新武装日本，企图以日本国土为基地，以日本人民为炮灰，好继续和扩大其侵略朝鲜、台湾，干涉越南、东南亚的罪恶行为。美帝国主义这一阴谋，破坏了一切国际协定，推翻了共同对日和约的基础，正是中苏友好同盟互助条约所坚决反对的，也是亚洲人民连日本人民在内所坚决反对的。可以断言：美帝国主义如果一意孤行，最后必将归于失败。
    中苏同盟愈加被为数极少的帝国主义掠夺者们所痛恨，就愈加为中苏两国人民和全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人民所拥护，因而就愈加巩固起来了。
    过去一年中，我们伟大的友邦热诚地忠实地履行了中苏友好同盟互助条约及其有关的关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定以及其他关于中苏两国经济合作和贸易协定，给了中国人民以慷慨的援助，大大地帮助了我国经济的恢复和发展。中国人民热烈感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联政府的这种伟大友谊。不管帝国主义侵略者如何暴跳如雷，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，是一天比一天亲密了。毫无疑问，占全人类三分之一的中苏伟大人民以和平和进步为目的的兄弟友谊，将给被帝国主义战争计划所威胁的世界，带来无限的青春的希望。
    毛主席万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
    伟大的中苏友好合作万岁！
