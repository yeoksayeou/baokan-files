　　The Joint State-Private Baoxing Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan Fails to Learn from Last Year's Lessons; Second Shaft Completely Destroyed

　　The joint state-private Baoxing Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan, Chahar Province, failed to learn adequately from the gas explosion accident last June. Leading cadres still harbor serious bureaucratism and complacency, resulting in another serious incident less than half a year later in which the second shaft was completely destroyed, causing irreparable losses to state property.

　　Last June, due to the serious complacency of the mine's leading cadres regarding safety work, a gas explosion occurred in the ninth ventilation opening of the fourth group tunneling area of the second shaft, killing five workers and injuring six. For this, the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, with the approval of the Government Administration Council, gave disciplinary actions to the personnel responsible for this dereliction of duty. However, this bloody lesson did not arouse serious vigilance among the mine's leading cadres. On December 17th of last year, the mine's new manager, Tian Zemin, said optimistically at the third employee representative conference: "The new stone gate connecting the vehicle lane has been opened, and we will no longer be threatened by natural fire in the future." But at 9:00 PM that same day, security guard Li Wenxiang discovered an open flame of about three feet in size on the wind sleeve above the tenth to eleventh lane. At that time, coal engineer Chen Wanquan (who was an experienced miner of more than twenty years) immediately suggested to pit manager Zhang Yucheng that "underground production should be stopped, and all efforts should be concentrated on building firewalls above and below the open flame to block the fire." However, pit manager Zhang Yucheng thought the open flame in the wind sleeve was "not serious" and decided: "Building the firewall should not affect production. If it can't be blocked in this shift, it can be blocked in the next shift." Mine engineer Wang Zimei also said, "This fire is not serious." Therefore, they only used mud to block the fire at first, which proved ineffective. The leading cadres also decided that in addition to extracting twenty-three workers (from the repair team and the extraction team) to carry out fire blocking work, other production would continue as normal. As a result, due to the shortage of manpower and the amount of work, firewalls could not be built simultaneously above and below the open flame. Furthermore, they made the wrong decision to use a four-horsepower blower to blow air upwards into the upwind channel (this measure aroused the firm opposition of some cadres and workers, but the leading cadres ignored it), causing the fire to spread and the underground to be filled with thick smoke. All production and fire blocking work were forced to stop. When workers Meng Xiangyun and Kong Yixiang told manager Tian Zemin about this situation, he optimistically said, "There is no problem." As a result, the fire grew bigger and bigger. Finally, although workers went down into the pit several times to try to block the fire, it was ineffective. On December 28th, the fire closed the pit mouth of the second shaft, and even the two newly drilled 230-meter-long stone gate connecting vehicle lanes were completely destroyed (all mechanical equipment such as electric motors, transformers, water pumps, winches, coal cars, high-voltage lines, water pipes, and air pipes underground, as well as artificially excavated pits, were destroyed), with losses valued at more than 2.3 billion yuan. It also resulted in a reduction of about 70% in the daily output of the entire mine. At the same time, the 3.5 million tons of bituminous coal buried in the lower part of the pit can never be mined. The mine's leading cadres have not yet paid serious attention to the above serious incident, nor have they conducted a deep self-criticism. It is hoped that the relevant departments will promptly conduct an inspection and deal with it.

　　Suggest Manufacturing Enough Plasma to Supply Injured Soldiers Fighting in Korea
　　Editor:
　　From the New China News Agency's February 1st dispatch, I read that Dr. Zhang, a doctor of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, transfused his own blood to Kim Chang-bo, a wounded soldier of the Korean People's Army; and that Korean nurse Choi Cai-ok transfused blood to Zhang Huaguo, a wounded soldier of the Chinese Volunteer Army. Due to the blood transfusions, the injuries of these two soldiers improved, and their lives were saved. This news made me feel that working in a battlefield area with temperatures of minus forty degrees, constantly risking one's life in gunfire, is already arduous enough; and yet, when saving the dying and healing the wounded, one must draw one's own blood to transfuse to others. This selfless spirit of sacrifice and noble character deeply moved me. Why don't we have a large supply of plasma to supply to the wounded soldiers on the Korean front? Plasma is made directly from human fresh blood. We should have an organization that manufactures plasma. We who remain in the rear should enthusiastically donate blood and manufacture it into plasma so that every wounded comrade at the front can receive an adequate supply at any time.
　　I suggest that the relevant authorities establish a plasma manufacturing plant. I think there must be many people who are willing to donate blood, very enthusiastically. I would like to be the first to express my willingness to donate 500 cc of fresh blood from my body immediately.

　　Gas Poisoning Accidents Occur Continuously in the Dormitories of Pangjiabao Mining Bureau
　　Editor:
　　In the dormitories of the Pangjiabao Mining Bureau in Xuanhua, gas poisoning accidents have occurred continuously five times from November of last year to the end of January of this year. Two workers and seven family members died; more than 200 people were injured.
　　The occurrence of these tragic accidents is mainly because the construction of houses last year was rushed, there were few supervisors, and most of the houses were not up to standard. More than 90% of the heated brick beds were padded with wet soil, with only a layer of red bricks covering the surface as a bed surface, and only a five-inch-high smoke passage, making it difficult for gas to escape. In addition, the leaders of the mine did not pay enough attention to winter prevention. Although air vents were installed, air holes were made under the doors, and a night watch team was organized, the problem was not completely solved. Some measures were even inappropriate. Take the air vents installed on the windows, for example, all of them were slanted with the opening facing downwards, so that the gas could not return and escape after rising; seven or eight air holes with a diameter of half an inch were made under the doors, but the smoke only gradually rises, so these air holes are also ineffective.
　　Although the weather is gradually warming up, Pangjiabao is located in the northern border region and still needs to use coal fire to maintain warmth for a relatively long period of time. It is hoped that the leaders of the mine will learn from these bloody lessons and prevent similar accidents from happening again.

　　Tiananmen Square and the National Emblem Should Not Be Abused
　　Editor:
　　I saw in the window of the shoe retail department of the Dalanshilar Hutong that there was a panoramic view of Tiananmen Square, with a portrait of Chairman Mao and the national emblem painted on the gate tower, and a large leather shoe placed on each arch bridge in front of Tiananmen Square. I think this arrangement is very inappropriate. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tiananmen Square has become a symbol of the infinite magnificence and strength of the new China. It is clearly inappropriate to use its image casually to decorate advertising windows to attract customers. In particular, there are regulations on the use of the national emblem, which cannot be used casually or have its image arbitrarily modified.

  下花园公私合营宝兴煤矿未接受去年教训  二坑被全部烧毁
    察哈尔省下花园公私合营宝兴煤矿，由于没有很好接受去年六月间瓦斯爆炸事故的教训，领导干部仍存在着严重的官僚主义和麻痹思想，以致不到半年，又发生了二坑被全部烧毁的严重事件，使国家财产遭受了无法弥补的损失。
    去年六月间，该矿领导干部由于对保安工作存在着严重的麻痹思想，曾造成该矿二坑坑下四组掘进区第九通风口瓦斯爆炸事件，炸死工人五名，伤六名。为此，中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会曾对这次失职人员，经政务院批准，分别给以处分。但这一血的教训，并未能引起该矿领导干部的严重警惕，去年十二月十七日该矿新经理田泽民在第三次职工代表大会上盲目乐观地说：“新石门串车道打通了，以后再不会受自然火的威胁了”。但同日下午九时，保安员李文祥就在十道巷至十一道巷之间的风袖顶上发现有三尺左右的明火。当时值班煤师陈万全（是二十余年的老矿工，有较丰富的灭火经验），即向坑长张玉成提出“应当停止坑下生产，集中全力在明火处上下部一齐砌堵火墙堵火”的建议，而坑长张玉成则认为风袖的明火“不要紧”，遂决定：“砌火墙不能影响生产，这班堵不完下班堵”。矿师王子美也说：“这火不算严重”。因此，开始仅以泥堵火，结果无效。领导干部还决定除抽出二十三名工人（保修组和回采组）进行堵火工作外，其他仍照常生产。结果因人少事多，在明火处不能上下同时砌堵火墙，加上错误决定在下部用四马力吹风机往上部逆风道吹风（此一措施，曾引起一部分干部和工人的坚决反对，但领导干部并未理睬），致使火势蔓延，坑下充满了浓烟，全部生产与堵火工作被迫停止，当工人孟祥云、孔义祥将此情况告诉给经理田泽民时，他还乐观地说：“不成问题”。结果，火势越来越大，最后，虽经工人几次下坑抢堵，但已无效。十二月二十八日，大火遂将二坑坑口封闭，连新凿的两条二百三十米长的石门串车道在内，全部被烧毁（坑下的电动机、变压器、抽水机、卷扬机、煤车、高压线、水管、风管等机械设备及人工开凿坑等全部烧毁），计损失价值达二十三亿余元。并使全矿每日减产百分之七十左右。同时该坑下部所埋藏的三百五十万吨烟煤也永远不能回采。对上述严重事件，该矿领导干部尚未引起严重注意，亦未进行深刻检讨，望有关部门迅即进行检查和处理。

　  建议制造足够的血浆供应在朝鲜作战的受伤战士编辑同志：
    从报载新华社二月一日电讯中，读到朝鲜前线我国人民志愿军的医生张大夫，将自己的血输给朝鲜人民军受伤勇士金昌步；又有朝鲜护士崔彩玉，输血给我国志愿军受伤战士张华国。由于输血，使这两位战士的伤势好转，生命获救。这电讯使我感到：在零下四十度的地区从事战地工作，成天在枪林弹雨中出生入死，工作已经够艰苦了；而还要在救死扶伤之际，将自己的血抽出来输给别人。这种忘我的牺牲精神和高贵品质，深深感动了我。为什么我们没有大批血浆供应给在朝鲜前线受伤的勇士们？血浆是直接用人体的鲜血制造的，我们应该有一个制造血浆的机构。我们留在后方的人，应该踊跃输血，制造成血浆，使前方每一个受伤的同志们，能够随时得到充分的供应。
    我建议有关机关设立血浆制造所。我想志愿输血的人一定很多，很踊跃，我首先表示愿意立刻献出我身体内的鲜血五百西西。

  　庞家堡采矿所宿舍连续发生煤气熏人事故编辑同志：
    宣化庞家堡采矿所宿舍，自去年十一月到今年一月底止，连续发生五次煤气熏死人事故。死工人二名，家属七名；熏伤者达二百多名。
    这些惨痛事故的发生，主要是因为去年建筑房屋时工程日期急促，监工人员少，房屋大部不合规格。火炕百分之九十以上是用湿土垫的，上面只盖一层红砖作炕面，仅有五寸高的通烟道，煤气不易出去。再加上该矿领导上对冬防重视不够，虽曾安上风斗、门下打风孔，组织打更队，但问题没有得到彻底解决。甚至有些措施是不当的，就拿按在窗上的风斗来说，都是口朝下斜，结果煤气上升后仍不能回转出去；门下打了七、八个直径二分之一英寸大的风孔，但煤烟气体只有逐渐上升，这些风孔也不起作用。
    现在天气虽然日渐暖和，但庞家堡是处于塞北地带，还需要较长一个时期以煤火来维持温暖。希望该矿领导，接受这些血的教训，防止再度发生类似事故。          读者  鞠承华  朱国泰
  不应滥用天安门及国徽图案编辑同志：
    我看见大栅栏胡同鞋联门市部的橱窗里，布置着天安门的全景，门楼上画着毛主席的像及国徽等，在天安门前的每一拱桥上放了一只大皮鞋。我认为这样布置很不妥当。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，天安门已成为新中国无限壮丽、强大的象征，随便用它的图案来布置招揽顾客的广告橱窗，显然是不应该的。尤其是国徽的使用已有规定，不能随便使用或将它的图案任加描绘。
