To the Editor:

　　Smuggling activities in South China have a history, but the smuggling of gauze was even more serious last year. According to estimates by the Guangdong Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, approximately 9,000 bales of cotton yarn and 350,000 bolts of cotton cloth were smuggled out in 1950. The reasons for rampant smuggling are: (1) Since the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in June last year, prices in imperialist countries have generally risen, while prices in our country have remained stable, resulting in a large disparity in gauze prices at home and abroad, making it profitable for smugglers. (2) After the outbreak of the Korean War, there was a shortage of gauze in foreign markets, and imperialist countries systematically organized some speculative merchants to try to purchase goods in the Guangzhou and other markets and smuggle them out. (3) Some capitalists, attempting to disperse or escape capital, used smuggling to escape capital export.

　　The destination of smuggling is Hong Kong, and the smuggling locations are scattered in towns along the more than 2,000 kilometers of coastline in Guangdong. Since the strengthening of anti-smuggling work, large-scale smuggling has disappeared, but they have disintegrated into smaller groups to carry out activities.

　　The bad consequences of gauze smuggling are, first of all, disrupting the price of gauze in the domestic market; secondly, affecting the country's production and sales plans, causing an imbalance between supply and demand. Therefore, we must eradicate this smuggling phenomenon.

　　华南纱布走私现象严重
    编辑同志：
    华南的走私活动是有历史性的，而去年纱布的走私却更为严重。据广东省花纱布公司的估计，在一九五○年中，私运出口的棉纱约九千件，棉布约三十五万匹。走私猖獗的原因有：（一）自去年六月美帝发动侵朝战争以后，帝国主义国家物价普遍上涨，而我国物价则始终保持稳定，因而国内外纱布价格悬殊很大，使走私者有重利可图。（二）朝鲜战争发生后，国外市场纱布缺乏，帝国主义国家有计划的组织一些投机商人，设法在广州等地市场套购，偷运出口。（三）部分资本家，企图分散或逃避资金，利用走私将资金逃避出口。
    走私的目的地在香港，而走私的地方则分散在广东沿海二千余公里上的城镇。自缉私工作加强以后，大帮的走私虽已匿迹，但是他们却化整为零进行活动。
    纱布走私的恶果，首先是扰乱了国内纱布市场的价格；其次是影响到国家的产销计划，使供求失去平衡。因此我们必须根绝这种走私现象。
