　　Self-Criticism Regarding Failure to Execute Contract

　　To the Editors:

　　The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 3rd published a criticism from the Zhangjiakou Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Company regarding our office's failure to supply lump coal according to the contract. This is helping our office to promote business improvement work, and we sincerely welcome it. We have conducted an inspection of this matter and found that there are indeed many shortcomings in our work regarding the execution of the contract.

　　Last year, we signed a contract with the Coal Construction Company for 80,000 tons of lump coal. Later, due to the Datong Mining Bureau's trial implementation of new coal mining methods, lump coal production decreased. At the same time, a collapse accident occurred in the Wajinwan mine, and the Xing'ergou mine (the mine with the highest lump coal production) stopped mining. Therefore, on October 31st, our office, the company, and the Datong Mining Bureau held a consultation and signed another method for 20,000 tons of lump coal to remedy the shortcomings of the first contract. Not long after the implementation of this method, the main mining area of ​​Langergou, which produced more lump coal, collapsed again, and production continued to decline, so it was not possible to deliver the goods as required. Although this was caused by changes in production methods and production accidents, our understanding of the need to strictly execute contracts was vague. We mistakenly believed that the inability to complete the task was due to objective reasons; since we are all our own people, according to past practice, we could supply more if there was more coal and less if there was less. Therefore, although the Majiliang mine had 10,000 tons of lump coal in stock, it was not transported due to the difficulty of the road during the rainy season and the excessive transportation costs. All of this is because we did not realize the importance of strictly executing contracts; we did not realize that strictly executing contracts is an important key to ensuring the completion of the operational and financial plans of both parties who signed the contract.

　　On November 24th, a contract was signed with the company to deliver 10,000 tons of coal from the Majiliang Small Kiln Coal Mine (7,000 tons of lump coal and 3,000 tons of nut coal). By the end of December, the company had transported a total of 6,605 tons of coal, of which only 341 tons were nut coal. Judging from the above figures, we owed 736 tons of lump coal and 2,659 tons of nut coal. However, as of the end of December, the kiln still had a total of more than 9,000 tons of coal in stock. The reasons for not executing the contract included the fact that the road was not repaired, the vehicles were crowded, and transportation was difficult. However, the company's unwillingness to transport more nut coal was also one of the reasons.

　　In short, the main reason for the repeated failure to fulfill the contract is that our attitude towards the execution of the contract is not serious enough, and we did not realize that the contract is the main method to ensure the operational business plan. When signing the contract, we were not cautious enough and did not estimate the various problems that exist and may occur in a coal mine like Datong that has just resumed production. In promoting products, we did not regularly exchange information with the production side at any time, and solve problems in a timely manner. These are all things we should pay attention to in the future. In addition to accepting this lesson, we have reported the remaining problems of these contracts to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government will negotiate a solution with the China Coal Industry Company of the Ministry of Trade.

### 燃料工业部经理司大同办事处关于不执行所订合同的检讨

　　关于不执行所订合同的检讨       
    编辑同志：
    一月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了中国煤业建筑公司张家口分公司对本处不能按照合同供应块煤的批评，这是帮助本处推动业务改进工作，我们竭诚欢迎。我们对此已进行了检查，发现我们在执行合同中，工作上确存有很多缺点。
    去年我们和煤建公司签订八万吨块煤合同，后因大同矿务局试行新采煤方法，块煤生产减少，同时挖金湾矿井发生塌陷事故，杏儿沟矿井（产块煤最多的井）停止开采，因此十月三十一日本处与该公司及大同矿务局进行协议，另签一个二万吨块煤的办法，以补救第一个合同的缺点。执行这个办法不久，产块煤较多的狼儿沟主要回采区又塌顶，产量继续减少，因此又不能按规定交货。这虽然是由于生产方式改变和生产事故所造成的，但我们对于必须严格执行合同，在认识上是模糊的。错误地认为：不能完成任务，是客观原因；同是自己人，照过去惯例煤多了可以多供应，少了可以少供应。所以，马脊梁矿虽然存有块煤一万吨，但因雨季道路难走，拉运脚费过大，便未运搬。这都是因为没有认识到严格执行合同的重要性；没有认识到严格执行合同是保证订合同者双方经营计划与财政计划完成的一个重要关键。
    十一月二十四日，与该公司签订了一万吨马脊梁小窰煤矿场交货的合同（块煤七千吨，籽炭三千吨），至十二月底，该公司共运出煤六千六百零五吨，其中籽炭仅运了三四一吨。从上面数字看，我们欠交块煤七三六吨，籽炭二六五九吨。但截至十二月底，该窰场尚存煤共计九千余吨。未执行合同的原因，除路未修好、车辆拥挤、运输困难外，但该公司不愿多拉籽炭，亦是原因之一。
    总之，屡次不能履行合同的主要原因，是由于我们对执行合同的态度不够严肃，没有认识到合同是保障经营业务计划的主要方法。在签订合同时，也不够慎重，没有估计到像大同这样一个刚恢复生产的煤矿，存在与可能发生的各种问题。我们在推销产品上，没有随时与生产方面经常交换情况，一遇问题及时解决。这些都是值得我们今后注意的。我们除了接受这次的教训外，关于这几个合同遗留的问题，已报告中央人民政府燃料工业部，由中央人民政府燃料工业部与贸易部中国煤业公司协商解决办法。
