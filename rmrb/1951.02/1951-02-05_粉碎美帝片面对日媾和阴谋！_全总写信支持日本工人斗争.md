Xinhua News Agency, 4th — The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) has written a letter to Japanese workers, supporting their struggle against the United States' unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Japanese working men and women,

At a time when US imperialism is being defeated miserably in Korea by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, US President Truman has dispatched war-monger Dulles to Japan on January 25th to carry out so-called peace treaty conspiracies. Its purpose is to use a unilateral treaty with Japan to rearm Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and make Japan serve as a tool of US imperialism's aggression in Asia, in order to realize its world hegemony plan. This malicious conspiracy has aroused the most resolute and severe opposition from the people of the world!

The United States' attempt to carry out a unilateral peace treaty with Japan and its delusion of excluding China and the Soviet Union is a complete violation of all international agreements on Japan since World War II. This is a threat to the security of China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving countries in Asia, as well as Japan itself! This is a destruction of world peace!

Today, Japan has been dragged by US imperialism to the crossroads of war and peace. If Japan makes a separate peace with the United States, it will be reduced to a colony of US imperialism, and it will mean that Japan is hostile to the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, which is of course a dead end. At the same time, in economic terms, if Japan is hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, it will inevitably fall into a desperate situation with no way out. Therefore, the most important historical task currently facing the Japanese working class and the Japanese people is to oppose unilateral peace and rearmament, strive for a comprehensive and just treaty, and strive for friendly cooperation between Japan and the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union.

As we write this letter, we have already seen that 3,000 Japanese worker brothers at the Tsurumi Shipbuilding Company have bravely launched a struggle to demand the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive treaty, oppose the rearmament of Japan, demand national independence, and defend peace! We firmly believe that the Japanese working class, with its glorious tradition of struggle, will, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, unite the people of the whole country to smash the conspiracy of US imperialism!

We, the Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people, care about the fate of the Japanese people as much as we care about our own. We have always advocated the conclusion of a comprehensive and just treaty with Japan and opposed the rearmament of Japan, in order to restore the peaceful life of the Japanese people as soon as possible, and we will carry out a resolute struggle for this purpose!

The unity of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the unity of all the people of Asia, will surely smash the conspiracy of US imperialism. The path of historical development has been determined: the future of Japan belongs to the Japanese people; the fate of Asia must be decided by the people of Asia themselves. The US imperialism's attempt to create wars and dominate the world will surely suffer a shameful and miserable defeat like Hitler.

Wishing you victory in your struggle!

### 粉碎美帝片面对日媾和阴谋！  全总写信支持日本工人斗争

　　粉碎美帝片面对日媾和阴谋！
    全总写信支持日本工人斗争
    【新华社四日讯】中华全国总工会写信给日本工人，支持他们反对美国片面对日媾和和重新武装日本的斗争。原信如下：亲爱的日本男女工友们：
    正当美帝国主义在朝鲜被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队打得惨败的时候，美国总统杜鲁门就派遣战争贩子杜勒斯，在一月二十五日到日本进行所谓对日媾和的阴谋活动。其目的是想利用片面对日和约来重新武装日本，复活日本的军国主义，使日本充当美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略工具，以便实现它的世界霸权计划。这种恶毒的阴谋已经引起全世界人民最坚决最严厉的反对！
    美国企图进行片面对日媾和、妄想排斥中苏两国的阴谋，这是完全违反自第二次世界大战以来关于对日的一切国际协定。这是危害中国、苏联和亚洲各爱好和平国家以及日本本身的安全！这是破坏世界和平！
    今天，日本已经被美帝国主义拖上了战争与和平的十字路口。如果日本对美国单独媾和，就会沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，就是表示日本与中华人民共和国和苏联为敌，这当然是一条死路。同时在经济方面，日本如果和中国、苏联与亚洲人民为敌，必定陷于绝境，一筹莫展。所以在日本工人阶级和日本人民面前，目前最重大的历史任务，就是反对片面媾和和重新武装，争取全面的公正的和约，争取日本和中苏两大国的友好合作。
    我们写这封信的时候，已经看到日本鹤见造船公司三千日本工人兄弟们，为了要求立即缔结全面和约，反对重新武装日本，要求民族独立并保卫和平而英勇地展开斗争了！我们深信有着光荣的斗争传统的日本工人阶级，必能在日本共产党领导下，团结全国人民粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋！
    我们中国工人阶级、全中国人民关心日本人民的命运，就像关心自己的命运一样。我们从来就主张缔结全面的公正的对日和约，反对重新武装日本，以便尽早恢复日本人民的和平生活，并为此目的进行坚决的奋斗！
    中日两国人民的团结，全亚洲人民的团结，必能粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。历史发展的道路已经确定了：日本的未来是属于日本人民的；亚洲的命运要由亚洲人民自己决定。美帝国主义企图制造战争，霸占全世界的勾当一定会像希特勒一样遭受可耻的惨败。              预祝
    你们斗争的胜利！
                      中华全国总工会  一九五一年一月三十日
