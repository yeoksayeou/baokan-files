To our respected Chairman Mao:

We, the entire staff of the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, since the enthusiastic launch of the patriotic production competition last winter, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, the technical guidance from Soviet friends, and the collective spirit of the employees, with close connections between various departments, have not only successfully overfulfilled the production task for 1950, but also continuously created five new records in smelting time and three new records in output from January 1st to 7th this year. This smelting time is one hour and one minute shorter than last year's highest record, and the daily output exceeds last year's highest record by 4.9 percent. The creation of these new records brings us infinite courage and strength. We confidently assure you that we will resolutely eliminate shortcomings in our work, complete the new tasks assigned to us by the state in 1951, and contribute all our strength to world peace and the prosperity of our motherland.
        We wish you
    Good health
　Labor models Wang Guiying, Wang Dianying, and Ma Shoujin, and all the staff of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant

Respected Chairman Mao:

Let us report to you a great piece of good news from our factory:

The ××-ton open-hearth furnace of the Shanghai Steel Company No. 1 Plant has been smelting continuously since its major overhaul in June 1950, and the furnace age has reached over 400 heats. This is an unprecedented new record.

We are not complacent about this record. We assure you that we will create even higher records. We will resolutely respond to your call, exert all our strength in production, and strive to build a strong national defense and economic power.
        We wish you
    Good health
　　　  All staff of the Shanghai Steel Company No. 1 Plant
