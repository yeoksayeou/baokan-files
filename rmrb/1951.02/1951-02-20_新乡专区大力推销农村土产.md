　　Xinxiang Special District Vigorously Promotes Rural Native Products
    The Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province has achieved considerable success in organizing commodity exchange. Most of the local products in the district have been sold, the relationship between public and private sectors has been further coordinated, and the commercial network has gradually recovered and been established. As a result, the market is prosperous and the purchasing power of farmers has increased. After selling their local products, farmers have increased their income significantly and have purchased agricultural tools and livestock in preparation for this year's spring production. Major local products in the district have found sales channels. According to statistics from early January, out of thirty-two types of local products with a total value of 182.0 billion yuan, approximately 113.9 billion yuan worth had been sold, accounting for 62% of the total production. Among the thirty-two types of local products, seventeen types, including bricks and tiles, sulfur, bamboo products, plowshares, and bean cakes, had sales exceeding 80%; nine types, including vats, vegetable oil, lime, and peanuts, had sales exceeding 66%; and six types, including stone pencils, ginger, and homespun cloth, had relatively slow sales. However, the inventory of Bo'ai ginger has been reduced to less than one million jin due to active promotion. High-quality homespun cloth also sells quickly. Farmers' purchasing power has greatly increased after selling their local products in large quantities. For example, Guitun Village in Bo'ai County purchased a car after participating in the transportation of local products. Farmers in Gu Village in the Fifth District of Huixian County used their income from transportation, milling and other side businesses, plus some surplus grain from agricultural income, to purchase twelve head of livestock. Farmers' purchasing power for daily necessities has also increased due to the promotion of local products. According to statistics from the Mulandi store market in Wuzhi, the Spring Festival supply alone required 80,000 jin of salt, 50,000 jin of sesame oil, 500 bolts of foreign cloth, 300,000 jin of coal, and 10,000 jin of pork and mutton, and 10,000 jin of candles. According to tax bureau statistics, the amount of pork, mutton, and other meats slaughtered and sold in the entire special district increased by 66% in September, October, and November of 1950 compared to the same period in 1949. These figures not only show that farmers' lives have improved after selling local products, but also indicate that vigorous promotion of local products will lay a good material foundation for agricultural production this year.
    The promotion of local products has revitalized the rural economy in the district, which has also boosted the urban markets. The number of industrial and commercial households in Wuzhi, Huixian, Yuanyang, Jixian, and Bo'ai counties increased by 303 from November to December last year. Thirty-seven new firms were established to promote local products. The commercial network is also gradually recovering and being established, and trade relations have been established with major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. For example, the Baiquan Pharmacy in Huixian County had fixed business contacts with twenty-seven merchants in seven cities, including Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou. Now, it has increased to thirty-six. At the same time, public and private commercial enterprises have cooperated to promote local products, thereby experiencing the correctness of "division of labor and cooperation, each getting what they deserve" under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Banks provided 1.2 billion yuan in loans to support the promotion of local products, of which private merchants and private firms received one-third of the loans. This has made the relationship between the public and private sectors more coordinated in practice.
    The district has adopted the following measures in promoting local products, which are worth promoting in various places.
    First, from top to bottom, emphasize and universally mobilize industrial and commercial circles and the masses to actively open up sales channels. The province, special district, and counties held several meetings of industrial and commercial representatives and local product promotion meetings, which not only dispelled private merchants' concerns in implementing policies, but also reversed cadres' underestimation of this work. In the specific organization of local product promotion, in addition to state-owned trading companies and cooperatives conducting organized promotion, the decentralized and mass promotion work was emphasized, given the particularly dispersed nature of local products. Of the local products that have been promoted in the district, 82% were promoted by the masses in a decentralized manner. The opening of sales channels also mainly relied on the masses. For example, Lu Shenggong Tobacco Shop, a private merchant in Bo'ai, sent water pipes and advertisements to Shandong, Zhoucun, and Lijin, and after establishing relationships, sales increased from 4,000 jin per month to 15,000 jin per month. The stone pencils of Xiaoweiying were originally unsalable. After Zhang Yinhai and two others, the director of the village cooperative, made 300 standard stone pencils and promoted them in Zhengzhou, Jinan, Xingtai, and Xuzhou, they were immediately sold out because they improved their reputation.
    Second, pay attention to contract management. Experience has proven that the development of contract management is an effective way to overcome blind production and blind promotion and achieve "production based on sales." Through contract management, state-owned and public-private joint ventures, public and private enterprises, production, transportation, and sales, etc., are organized and closely integrated. The counties in the district have recently signed 110 agreements.
    Third, pay attention to opening up sales channels in other places, but also cannot ignore domestic exchanges. According to statistics from Jiyuan, twenty-seven types of export goods were worth 9.4 billion yuan, and twenty-two types of domestic goods were worth 3.9 billion yuan. Of the 2.94 million bolts of homespun cloth in the district, more than 2.25 million bolts were used and sold domestically, and only 680,000 bolts were exported. The exchange of goods between domestic and foreign places has been strengthened.
    Fourth, carrying out credit work is a good way to absorb idle funds, overcome financial difficulties, and drive private lending. After farmers have a surplus of harvest, they are also required to deposit surplus grain and funds into credit departments, banks, and supply and marketing cooperatives. Credit departments have been organized and piloted in more than ten villages in Jiyuan, Qinyang, Wenxian, Xiuwu, and Huixian counties. The six village credit departments piloted by the bank in the three counties of Ji, Qin, and Hui alone absorbed deposits from 303 households, totaling 62,094 jin of grain such as wheat and corn, and 786,200 yuan in RMB; loans were issued to 98 households, totaling 44,114 jin of grain and 1,457,500 yuan in RMB. According to statistics from Xunzhang Village in Jiyuan alone, 15,572 jin of grain and 437,500 yuan were loaned out, which farmers used to purchase two cotton ginning machines and seven head of livestock. In addition, three households engaged in weaving wicker products, two flour mills, two iron and woodworking artisans, and thirteen transporters were supported. After the development of credit and private lending, it can make peddlers more flexible, which has a considerable effect on promoting commodity exchange.

　　新乡专区大力推销农村土产
    平原省新乡专区大部地区组织物资交流工作已有相当成绩。该区土产已大部销出，公私关系得到进一步协调，商业网也已逐渐恢复和建立，因而市场繁荣，农民购买力增加。各地农民在卖出土产后，增加了大宗收入，纷纷购置农具、牲口，准备今年春耕大生产。该区大宗主要土产品均已找到销路。据一月上旬统计，三十二种土产品，总值一、八二○余亿元，已销出约值一、一三九亿元，占总产量百分之六十二。三十二种土产品中，已销出百分之八十以上的，有砖瓦、硫磺、竹货、犁面、豆饼等十七种；已销出百分之六十六以上的有缸、植物油、石灰、花生等九种；比较滞销的是石笔、生姜、土布等六种。但博爱生姜，由于积极组织推销，现存货已不上百万斤。土布质量好的，销售也很快。农民在大批出售了土产之后，购买力大大提高了。如博爱县贵屯村参加土产运输之后，购买汽车一辆。辉县五区固村，农民以运输、粉房等副业收入，加上农业收入的一部余粮，添购了十二头牲口。农民的生活资料的购买力，也因土产推销而提高。据武陟木栾店市场统计，仅春节供应就需准备食盐八万斤，香油五万斤，洋布五百匹，煤三十万斤，猪羊肉一万斤，蜡烛一万斤。另据税局统计，全专区一九五○年九、十、十一三个月，较一九四九年同一时期宰杀出卖猪羊等肉类增加百分之六十六。上述数字，不仅说明农民在推销出土产以后生活得以改善，也可以看出大力推销土产，将为今年农业生产，奠定很好的物质基础。
    该区由于土产推销，活跃了农村经济，因而也繁荣了城镇市场。武陟、辉县、原阳、汲县、博爱五县工商户，从去年十一月到十二月增加了三○三户。为了推销土产，新增行栈三十七户。商业网也在逐渐恢复与建立，先后与京、津、沪、穗等大城市建立了交易关系。如辉县百泉药行，原与沪、汉、穗、津、成都、西安、郑州等七个城市的二十七家商人有固定商业联系，现已增至三十六家。同时，因为公私营商业共同配合进行土产推销工作，从而体验到在国营经济领导下“分工合作，各得其所”的正确性。银行扶助土产推销贷出十二亿元，其中私商及私人行栈贷到款数达三分之一。这就在实际工作中，使公私关系更加协调。
    该区在土产推销工作中，采取了以下几项办法，值得各地推广。
    首先，自上而下地重视与普遍发动工商界和群众积极打开销路。省、专、县举行了数次工商代表会及土产推销会议，不仅在贯彻政策上解除了私商顾虑，而且也扭转了干部轻视这一工作的观念。而在具体组织土产推销中，除国营贸易公司，合作社有组织地进行推销外，根据土产特别分散的特点，重视了分散的，群众性的推销工作。该区已推销的土产中，有百分之八十二是群众分散推销的。销路的打开，主要也是依靠群众。如博爱私商路盛公烟房，向山东、周村、利津等地寄水烟、发广告、打通关系后，由过去月销四、○○○斤增到现在月销一五、○○○斤。校尉营石笔，原来滞销，经过该村村社主任张银海等三人制出标准石笔三百把，到郑州、济南、邢台、徐州等地推销，因为提高了信誉，立即销光。
    第二、重视合同经营工作。经验证明，合同经营的开展，是克服盲目生产，盲目推销，达到“以销定产”的有效办法。通过合同经营，使国营与公私合营，公营与私营，产、运、销等各方面，有组织地密切结合了起来。该区各县最近已订立协议达一一○件。
    第三、注意打开外地销路，但也不可忽视内地交流。据济源统计，二十七种外销物资，价值九十四亿元，二十二种内销物资，价值三十九亿元。全区二九四万匹土布，内地自用及自销在二二五万匹以上，外销数仅为六十八万匹。现内外地物资交流工作，均有所加强。
    第四、开展信贷工作，是吸收游资，克服资金困难，带动私人借贷的很好方法。在农民丰收有余之后，亦要求把余粮余款存入信用部，银行及供销社，在济源、沁阳、温县、修武、辉县等县十余村，组织与试办了信用部。仅银行在济、沁、辉三县试办的六个村信用部，即吸收了三○三户存款，计存入麦子、玉米等粮食六二、○九四斤，人民币七八六、二○○元；放给九十八户，计粮食四四、一一四斤，人民币一、四五七、五○○元。仅济源训掌一村统计，贷出粮食一五、五七二斤，款四三七、五○○元，农民用以购买弹花车二辆，牲口七头。另扶植编荆货的三家，粉房二座、铁木匠二户，贩运十三户等。信贷及私人借贷开展之后，即可使担挑贩运者周转灵活，对推动物资交流，有相当作用。（新乡专署）
