　　The Significance of the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party
　　By Móricz Erik, Minister of Justice of Hungary, Member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party

　　The Hungarian Working People's Party, the Hungarian communists, and all the working people of Hungary are preparing for a great event. The Party's Second Congress will open on February 24th. The Congress will summarize the work since the last Congress and point out the future tasks to achieve socialism.
　　This is the fifth congress convened by the Hungarian communists. The first and second congresses (referring to the congresses of the Hungarian Communist Party - translator) were held during the oppressed period under the Horthy regime. At that time, the Hungarian communists could only struggle underground against this oppressive, anti-people regime. These two congresses, in the darkest years of oppression, pointed out the path for the Hungarian workers and all the Hungarian working people, and instilled new strength into the working people's struggle for freedom against fascist tyranny.
　　After the Soviet Union liberated Hungary, the Hungarian Communist Party—now a legally existing party—held a decisive position in the country's construction and leadership. The third congress was held at this time. At this congress, the party issued the slogan: "We are building the country for the working people, not for the capitalists!"
　　The Hungarian working people followed the instructions of this congress, and under the leadership of Comrade Rákosi, struggled to eliminate the damage of the war, implement a planned economy, and mobilize the broad masses of working people to unite and struggle to achieve this goal. Less than two years after the congress, as a result of the tireless work of the Hungarian communists, the fragmentation within the Hungarian working class came to an end, and the united party of the Hungarian working people, the Hungarian Working People's Party, was established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. Since the unification congress—the First Congress of the Working People's Party—the Hungarian workers have been cooperating with the peasants and working together to double their efforts to achieve their goals.
　　The current congress is being held in a different environment from the previous congresses. The characteristic of the current international situation is the strengthening of the aggressive ambitions of the imperialists and their vassals, and the continuous growth of the strength of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union. In this struggle, the responsibilities of the Hungarian people and their leading party have increased. In the world's struggle for peace and freedom, they must accept this test with their work, vigilance, and combat readiness. They must embody Comrade Rákosi's words, that "Hungary is not a gap in the peace front, but a strong fortress." As a result of the development of domestic construction after liberation, the position of the Hungarian communists in the country, as well as the entire life of Hungary, has changed. The Hungary of landlords and gentlemen and the country of "millions of beggars" (rural proletarians) has become a people's democratic country that is building socialism, a people's republic with the Hungarian Working People's Party as its leading force. This party is the force that has led the Hungarian people to victory in the past few years. It has used the experience of the Soviet Bolshevik Party, as well as the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, to point out the way to solve problems and difficulties, and how to defeat the attacks of enemies at home and abroad in the past few years. As a result of these struggles, the Hungarian people have come to believe that this party is their most qualified leader. Today, all the working people and social strata of Hungary have confidence, love, loyalty, and reverence for the party, because they can see from their own experience that under the leadership of the party and Comrade Rákosi, they are confidently moving towards ever-increasing material and cultural prosperity to achieve socialism. The upcoming congress will gather the best of the Hungarian communists and the Hungarian people. It must solve several tasks in order to point out the way forward. The Hungarian working people expect the congress to answer and solve many problems arising from the development of people's democracy and the construction of socialism. They also expect the congress to point out new tasks in the coming years.
　　The main issues are the implementation of the first five-year plan, strengthening the Hungarian people's struggle for peace, and intensifying the connection between party members and non-party members. The Hungarian people understand the importance of this congress, and they are preparing for the congress as if they are welcoming a great festival for the whole nation.
　　The meetings to elect delegates to the congress have already been held throughout the country. These election meetings and party meetings in rural and urban areas were conducted in a warm atmosphere, with full unity among the working people, and with the spirit of unity between party members and non-party members.
　　An important part of the preparation for the congress is being carried out in the workplace. The Hungarian working people are willing to show that they firmly support the party, and they completely regard their own goals as one with the party's goals. At the same time, they also regard the party's congress as their own festival. But they also recognize the fact that only by increasing production and working better, and by raising their awareness and ideological level, can they successfully strive for the party's goals—socialism and peace, and only in this way can they show their loyalty and love for the party.
　　Therefore, the daily life of the working people is combined with the preparation and celebration of the congress. In order to pay tribute to the congress, the workers of the Hofman factory in Budapest launched a competition to create new and better work standards. Soon, the whole country responded to this action, and the working class and intellectuals accepted this challenge with equal enthusiasm. The Central Committee of our party discussed this competition, approved it, and encouraged our working people to expand this movement. One guarantee after another to participate in the competition was submitted, all determined to complete the five-year plan in the shortest possible time, to accelerate the construction of socialism in agriculture, to save raw materials and time, and to improve work. In the party, in social work, sports, art, education, and literature departments, important guarantees have been put forward. The competition will culminate in the "Congress Week" held during the Congress. At that time, like the several commemorative weeks held in honor of Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday and in tribute to the Korean people's struggle for freedom, the Hungarian people will celebrate the Congress with a week of especially enthusiastic work.
　　The preparations for the congress are intensifying, and it is even more deeply felt the love and gratitude of our people for our great liberator, the Soviet Union, and the great leader of the working people of the world—Comrade Stalin. In the lives of the working people, this love and gratitude is a living reality, and it is constantly strengthened by the constant friendly assistance, guidance, and support of the Soviet Union. In this great time, our people recall with special gratitude that the reconstruction of our country, the completion or even over-completion of the five-year plan, is primarily due to the constant support of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has provided suggestions and guidance, sent experts, and allowed various Hungarian delegations to study in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is always ready to help our people rebuild our country and build socialism.
　　The most important purpose of preparing for the congress is to strengthen the struggle for peace, to strengthen our militant unity with friendly people's democratic countries, and to strengthen the militant unity with the working class struggling in capitalist and colonial countries and with the tens of millions of people around the world who are fighting against the imperialist aggression ambitions for peace and freedom.
　　The imperialists' arms race and open incitement of a new war have made our people increasingly believe that expanding the peace struggle is necessary, strengthening our people's determination and vigilance, and hatred for the enemy. The feelings of proletarian internationalism are becoming increasingly abundant among our people. The Hungarian people understand more clearly than ever the current responsibilities of the peace struggle and are prepared to accept it. Understanding the seriousness of the situation, the Hungarian people are paying attention to international events, the fact that the Soviet Union is striving for peace, the heroic struggle of the Korean people, and the development of the struggle waged by the peace camp. They are also paying attention to the subversive activities of the enemy, whether it is the masterminds of the Tito bandits who endanger our borders, or the hateful attacks of their Washington bosses.
　　While preparing for the Congress, our working people are paying special attention to Comrade Rákosi—Stalin's first Hungarian student—whose life and work are a model of communist consciousness and loyalty, and who is leading the party and the Hungarian people with deep wisdom.
　　These are the thoughts of the Hungarian people in preparing to welcome the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party. They know that this congress will be a sign of a major step forward in the struggle to build socialism and defend peace.

　　匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会的意义
    匈牙利司法部部长匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员莫尔那尔·埃里克作
    匈牙利劳动人民党，匈牙利共产主义者们以及匈牙利全国劳动人民，正在准备一个伟大事件。党的第二次大会将于二月二十四日揭幕，大会将总结上次大会以后的工作，并指明今后的任务，以达到社会主义。
    这是匈牙利共产主义者们第五次集合起来所开的大会。第一第二两次大会（按指匈牙利共产党大会——译）是在霍尔梯政权下被压迫的时期中举行的，其时匈牙利共产主义者们只能够在地下向这压迫性的、反人民的政权作斗争。这两次大会在被压迫的最黑暗的年代中，给匈牙利工人及全体匈牙利劳动人民指出了道路，并且给劳动人民为自由而向法西斯暴政进行的斗争，灌输了新的力量。
    苏联解放匈牙利之后，匈牙利共产党——现在已是合法存在的党——在本国的建设及领导方面，占有决定性的地位，第三次大会是在这时候举行的。在这次大会上，党发布了这个口号：“我们正在为劳动人民而不是为资本家们建设国家！”
    匈牙利劳动人民遵循了这次大会的指示，在拉科西同志的领导之下，进行了斗争，清除战争破坏，实行计划经济，发动广大劳动人民团结起来为达到这一目的而斗争。大会后不满两年，由于匈牙利共产主义者们不知疲倦地工作的结果，匈牙利劳动阶级内部的分散现象即告结束，并且匈牙利劳动人民的统一的政党，即匈牙利劳动人民党，就在马克思主义列宁主义的基础上成立起来了。自从统一大会——劳动人民党的第一次大会——以来，匈牙利工人一直与农民合作，一致加倍努力地奋斗，以实现它的目标。
    现在召开的大会，其环境是与前几次大会不同的。目前国际形势的特点，是帝国主义者及其附庸们侵略野心的加强，和苏联领导的和平阵营力量的不断增长。在这个斗争中，匈牙利人民和他们的领导政党的责任加重了。在全世界争取和平与自由的斗争中，他们必须以他们的工作、警惕及战斗准备，来接受这个考验。他们必须体现拉科西同志的话，即“匈牙利不是和平战线上的缺口，而是一个坚强堡垒。”由于解放之后国内建设发展的结果，匈牙利共产主义者在国内的地位，以及匈牙利的全部生活，都有了改变。地主绅士们的匈牙利和“百万乞丐”（农村无产者）之国，已经变成了一个正在建造社会主义的人民民主国家，一个以匈牙利劳动人民党为其领导力量的人民共和国。这个党是在过去数年中领导匈牙利人民获得胜利的力量，它运用了苏联布尔塞维克党的经验，以及列宁和斯大林的教诲，在过去数年中指出了如何解决问题和困难、如何击退国内国外敌人进攻的道路。由于这些斗争之后的结果，匈牙利人民已经相信，这个党是他们最有资格的领导者。今天匈牙利全国劳动人民和社会各阶层，都对党怀着信心和热爱、忠诚和虔敬，因为他们可以从自己的经验中看到，在党和拉科西同志的领导之下，他们正在有把握地迈向永远在增长中的物质与文化的繁荣，以实现社会主义。目前即将举行的大会，将集合匈牙利共产主义者和匈牙利人民中的最优秀分子，它必须解决若干任务，以便指出今后前进的道路。匈牙利劳动人民预期大会将解答并解决从人民民主的发展及社会主义的建造中产生出来的许多问题。他们同时也期望大会将指明今后数年中的新任务。
    主要的各问题就是实现第一个五年计划，加强匈牙利人民争取和平的斗争，以及加紧党员与非党员之间的连系。匈牙利人民了解这次大会的重要意义，他们正在如同迎接全民族的伟大节日一样地准备大会。
    选举大会代表的会议，已经在全国举行了。这些选举会议和乡村及城市的党会议，是在热烈的气氛中，在劳动人民充分团结、党员与非党人民一致的精神之下进行的。
    大会的准备工作中的一个重要部分，是在工作岗位上进行的。匈牙利的劳动人民愿意表现出他们是坚定地拥护党的，他们完全把自己和党的目标视为一体，同时他们也把党的大会看作他们自己的节日。但是他们同时也认识这个事实：只有增加生产量和工作得更好，提高觉悟程度和思想水平，他们才能够顺利地争取到党的目标——社会主义与和平，也只有这样才能够表现他们对党的忠诚和热爱。
    因此，劳动人民的日常生活便与大会的筹备和庆祝结合起来了。为了向大会致敬，布达佩斯霍夫汉工厂的工人发起了一个竞赛运动，要创造新的和更好的工作标准。不久，全国响应了这个行动，工人阶级和知识分子都以同样的热情接受了这个挑战。我们党的中央委员会讨论了这竞赛运动，批准了它，并且鼓励我们的劳动人民扩展这一运动。参加竞赛运动的保证书一份紧接着一份递进来，都决心尽可能以最短时间来完成五年计划；加速建设农业方面的社会主义；节省原料和时间与改善工作。在党内，在社会工作、运动、艺术、教育以及文学各部门，都提出了重要的保证。竞赛运动将在大会期内举行的“大会周”达到高潮，在那时候，类如在斯大林同志七十寿辰和向朝鲜人民争取自由的战斗致敬时举行的几个纪念周一样，匈牙利人民将用一个星期的特别热烈工作来庆祝大会。
    大会的筹备正在加紧进行之中，并且更令人体会到我国人民对于我们伟大的解放者，苏联和全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖——斯大林同志的热爱和感激。在劳动人民的生活中，这种热爱和感激是一个活生生的现实，并且因苏联的经常的友谊的协助、指导和支援而日益加强着。在这伟大的时节，我国人民以特别感激的心情来回想到，我国的重建，五年计划的完成甚至超额完成，首先是由于苏联的经常支援，苏联提出了建议和指导，派遣了专家，并且允许匈牙利各种代表团在苏联学习，苏联随时准备着帮助我国人民重建我国和建设社会主义。
    筹备大会最重要的用意，是加强争取和平的斗争，加强我们和友好的人民民主国家之间的战斗团结，加强和资本主义及殖民地国家中正在斗争的工人阶级以及全世界成千成万正在与帝国主义侵略野心作战以争取和平和自由的人们之间的战斗团结。
    帝国主义的备战和公开煽动一个新的战争，使我国人民日益相信扩大和平斗争是必要的，加强了我国人民的决心和警惕性以及对敌人的憎恨。无产阶级国际主义的感情在我国人民之中日益充沛，匈牙利人民比从前更明确地了解当前和平斗争的责任并且准备接受它。洞悉形势的严重性，匈牙利人民注视着国际事件，苏联努力和平的事实，英勇的朝鲜人民的战斗以及和平阵营所进行的斗争的发展。他们也为自己注意着敌人的颠覆性活动，不论这是危及我国边境的铁托匪徒的主使者，还是他们的华盛顿老板们的可恨的攻击。
    在筹备大会的时候，我们劳动人民以特别的热爱注视着斯大林的第一个匈牙利学生拉科西同志——他的生活和工作，是共产主义者觉悟和忠诚的榜样，他正在以深刻的智慧领导着党和匈牙利人民。
    这些就是匈牙利人民在准备迎接匈牙利劳动人民党第二次大会的思想，他们知道，这次大会将是建设社会主义和保卫和平的斗争向前迈进一大步的标志。
