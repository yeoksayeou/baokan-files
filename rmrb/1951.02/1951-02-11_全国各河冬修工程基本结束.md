Xinhua News Agency Report: Winter repair projects on rivers across the country have largely concluded, with the exception of dredging work and surveying in the Huai River basin, and flood control projects in the Pearl River basin of South China, which are continuing. Since the beginning of winter last year, various regions have utilized the agricultural off-season to carry out winter repair projects on various rivers. The main purpose of these projects is to resolve some of the conflicts between this year's spring repair projects and spring plowing production. This winter repair project mobilized more than 1.8 million laborers. Due to the thorough preparation work carried out by various regions before construction, and the labor competitions carried out by the vast number of laborers during construction, the winter repair projects on various rivers progressed rapidly. Now, the laborers on various rivers have completed the winter repair tasks in a timely manner.

On the Huai River, the entire earthwork for the Laowangpo and Wu Songhu depression storage projects in the upper reaches has been completed, as well as most of the earthwork for the Jiaoting Lake and Tong Lake storage projects, and partial dredging and dike closure and restoration projects on the tributaries of the Ru River, Bailu River, Zhu River, Sa River, and Dugong River. Partial dike restoration projects in the middle reaches of the Huai River and its tributaries, and the embankment reinforcement projects of the Grand Canal have also been completed. Dredging projects in the middle reaches of various rivers, the waterway to the sea in the lower reaches, and the surveying work of the reservoir sites in the upper reaches are still ongoing.

In Hebei Province, the regulation project of the lower reaches of the Chaobai River and the annual maintenance projects of the Yongding, Daqing, Ziya, and Jiyun Rivers were completed as early as the end of November last year, completing a total of 2.6 million cubic meters of earthwork.

On the Yellow River, the four provinces along the Yellow River, including Suiyuan, Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong, have reinforced more than 2.84 million cubic meters of earth on the Yellow River dikes.

Shandong Province has completed the fourth phase of the Daoshu River project, and a portion of the Shu River floodwaters can be discharged into the sea through the new river channel this summer.

In northern Jiangsu, the excavation of the main channel of the New Yi River and the regulation of the drainage channels on both sides of the New Yi River have been completed. In addition, the regulation projects of dikes and culverts in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are nearing completion, and flood control projects in the Pearl River basin are continuing.
