　　A Respectful Response to Criticisms of Textbooks from All Quarters
　　People's Education Publishing House

    Regarding criticisms and corrections of the middle and primary school Chinese, history, and geography textbooks for the autumn of 1950, the ones we have seen fall into the following categories:

    The first category consists of articles published in newspapers and magazines, including twenty-two in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, two each in the Guangming Daily, New Education, and Northeast Education, and one each in the People's Daily, Yangtze Daily, Songjiang Education, and Hunan Teacher, for a total of thirty-two articles.

    The second category consists of thirty-two pieces of correspondence written to the "Book Review" section of the *People's Daily* in response to our advertisement soliciting opinions on textbooks.

    The third category consists of twenty-three pieces of criticism sent directly to us so far.

    We sincerely express our gratitude to all the comrades who wrote articles and letters. Our work has been rough, and thanks to the help of our comrades, we have been able to correct and improve some aspects, for which we are grateful. Students are reading textbooks that are far from perfect, and thanks to the help of our comrades, we have been able to reduce that distance to a greater or lesser extent, for which we are especially grateful. We have few people and cannot write to the comrades early. In addition to expressing our gratitude, we will explain in detail how we accept criticism, what different opinions we have, and where our capabilities fall short. Now, let us first make a general statement in this article, hoping that all comrades can see this article and appreciate our difficulties.

    For the sake of clarity, we will discuss Chinese, history, and geography separately.

            First, let's talk about Chinese textbooks.

    A total of thirty-eight articles of criticism on Chinese textbooks have been seen, which can be answered separately from the middle school and primary school perspectives.

    After liberation, most areas adopted two sets of Chinese textbooks for middle schools: one set was *Junior Middle School Chinese* edited by Wang Shishan and *Senior Middle School Chinese* edited by Zhou Jing et al., published by Xinhua Bookstore; the other set was *Junior Middle School Chinese Textbook* edited by Song Yunbin et al. and *Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook* edited by Zhou Zumo et al., published by Xinhua Bookstore. The latter set was gradually published from the autumn of 1950 to the spring of 1951, while the former set will no longer be published from the spring of 1951 onwards. Therefore, we will only address the opinions regarding the latter set.

    According to the analysis of comrades' opinions, there are roughly the following aspects: the selection of teaching materials, the arrangement of teaching materials, the annotations, and the prompts to help teaching.

    The selection of teaching materials is the main task of editing Chinese textbooks. Whether it is well-compiled depends on whether the selection is appropriate or not. The standard for selection requires, on the one hand, that the content be rich and that the task of ideological and political education be completed through the content; on the other hand, that the expression form be perfect and that the task of Chinese language education be completed through the expression form. We have identified this standard, but the results we have achieved may not fully meet the standard, and what we see and what we do cannot be completely consistent. The "Notes" column in the *Ta Kung Pao* once pointed out that the selection of materials for the *Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook* is better in the first volume, worse in the third volume, and even worse in the fifth volume. Some people have also suggested that the selection of materials for the *Junior Middle School Chinese Textbook*, such as "Qu Yuan" in the second volume and "Silkworm and Ant" in the third volume, is not very appropriate. For example, in "Yu Lai Did Not Die" in the first volume of senior high school, Mr. Liu San pointed out many shortcomings in the writing of this article, which is not a work that should be selected. These opinions are very valuable, and we are willing to accept them. We must adjust them when we recompile them in the future. Now, in order to supply them in time, we do not have time to recompile them except for making some necessary corrections. We hope that teachers will analyze and criticize those unsuitable selections when teaching them, so that students will still benefit from them.

    Whether translated articles should be included in Chinese textbooks, and if so, how much should they account for, is a question that has also been raised. Mr. Jun Jian and Mr. Lu Danlin pointed out that the amount of translated articles is too much, and some translations are poorly translated, with obscure words and sentences, and advocated that they should not be selected too much. Mr. Xuan Chang believes that translated articles should be selected, from which foreign vocabulary, grammar and precise expressions can be absorbed. We believe that these two aspects can be complementary. As far as the proportion of translations in the teaching materials is concerned, we have indeed selected more, and some translations are not entirely suitable as model essays in terms of wording.

    Regarding the selection of classical Chinese texts for reading, opinions vary greatly. Some say that senior high school should not teach classical Chinese at all, while others say that it should not be taught from the second grade, but from the first grade; some complain that we have selected too much, while others complain that we have selected too little. We believe that shallow classical Chinese texts should still be selected for reading in senior high school. The purpose of selecting them is "to enable students to clearly understand the similarities and differences between classical Chinese and modern spoken language, and to develop the preliminary ability to read classical Chinese reference books" (*General Ideas for Editing Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook*). Of course, the length of the selection should not be too long, and the text should not be too deep. We feel that some of the classical Chinese texts we have selected are too classical, such as "Battle at Lang" and "Three Poems by Du Fu" (Volume 5).

    It is not easy to select articles suitable for Chinese teaching materials. We do not know much, have not seen widely, and lack the ability to identify. We hope that teachers will give us more help.

    We have not done well in the arrangement of teaching materials. In addition to the fact that the depth of the selected articles is not entirely suitable for the level of each grade, the main problem is that the order and unit coordination cannot be completely satisfactory. Mr. Wang Shimin suggested that "each semester's teaching materials should assume a center of gravity and be selected in a planned and systematic way." We have carefully studied this opinion and believe that this approach is basically correct. However, there cannot be only one center of gravity. Because the teaching materials of the same semester must take into account the diversity of content and style, we can only make the teaching materials in a book belong to several units. The selected articles in each unit should illuminate and corroborate each other, and there should be connections between the units. The teaching materials in the former part should lead to the teaching materials in the latter part. We should strive for association and organization in "diversity" so that it does not become a collection of loose-leaf selections. We have not reached this standard. As for how to clearly define the focus of each book, how to connect each book with each other, and how to proceed step by step, we have considered it, but it is not yet mature and we cannot think clearly. We earnestly hope to get instructions from all parties.

    In terms of annotations, we have done a rough job (the *Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook* has not been annotated because it was rushed to be published in time). We have not been careful enough in distinguishing which should be annotated and which should not be annotated. We have not been thoughtful enough about which should be annotated in detail and which can be annotated briefly. These should be corrected when we recompile them in the future. There is an item in the annotation that introduces the author. We have no way to investigate some authors, so we have to omit them. Teachers have written to inquire about this. We believe that except for writers who are engaged in writing, a relatively detailed introduction should be given. For other authors, even if we do not know their experience, it does not hinder the teaching. We do not know if this opinion is correct.

    Why should a certain article be studied, what should be paid attention to when studying that article, and what should be gained are all things that teachers must master. In order to help teachers grasp these issues, we have attached "Thinking, Discussion, and Exercises" materials after each selected article in the *Junior Middle School Chinese Textbook* (the *Senior Middle School Chinese Textbook* has not yet done this). Because of separate editing and rushing to publish, these materials appear scattered, fragmented, and without a consistent system when viewed as a whole set. Some have not pointed out the important points, and some have been too broad and rambling. These shortcomings should be corrected in the future. There is no systematic arrangement of grammar tips. Mr. Jing Di of Wenquan Middle School in Beijing has raised his opinions to us. Regarding grammar teaching, we believe that it is easier to achieve results by compiling separate teaching materials for it, and we are currently considering it.

    Most areas use the *Elementary School Chinese* and *High School Chinese* edited by Liu Songtao et al., published by Huabei Xinhua Bookstore, as the primary school Chinese textbooks. This set of textbooks was published in March 1948, and was later revised several times by the Textbook Compilation and Review Committee of the Education Department of the Huabei People's Government and the Compilation and Review Bureau of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration. During the revision, some places corrected individual errors, and some places replaced some materials. The work was very fragmented. In order to accommodate the relationship between new words, some places were inevitably far-fetched. Therefore, several revisions did not make a comprehensive consideration from the spirit, style, and materials of the whole book. This set of textbooks has many shortcomings.

    This set of textbooks focuses on rural life. The reason is that this set of books was originally for schools in the Huabei Liberated Area (Beijing was not yet liberated at the time of the first edition). In order to combine with reality, more rural teaching materials were taken. Later, urban schools also adopted it, and it was felt that it was not entirely suitable. Teachers and students in urban areas found it difficult to understand many vocabularies, nouns, and living habits in teaching. At the same time, the language used for writing is not only northern dialect, but also many dialects and slang that are popular in a narrow area. Schools in North China and Northwest China have fewer problems with these dialects and slang, but schools in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China have no way to explain them, which creates a major obstacle to teaching. We have received many letters asking how to annotate these dialects and slang.

    For these two issues—teaching materials focus on rural life and obscure dialects and slang—we are working hard to solve them in the revision of the textbooks for the autumn semester of 1951. On the one hand, we will eliminate some regional materials that only belong to the situation of individual rural areas and replace them with more general materials. We will delete obscure dialects and slang, and add annotations to those that cannot be deleted.

    The arrangement of teaching materials in primary school Chinese textbooks must be combined with the time and seasons in some places in order to connect with reality. This set of books is arranged for the beginning of the spring semester. Schools that start in the fall semester feel that there are difficulties in teaching. When teaching about National Day celebrations and Children's Day, they cannot be coordinated with festival activities, and changes in nature cannot be taught in the appropriate seasons, giving students the conditions for practical observation. Among the opinions we have received, many have raised this issue. To solve this problem, we can only compile two sets of textbooks to meet the different needs of schools starting in the spring and autumn semesters. We have such a proposal: we want to revise this set of books for schools starting in the spring semester, and revise the set originally published by Shanghai United Publishing House for schools starting in the autumn semester. This proposal is being submitted to the Central Ministry of Education for instructions.

    In addition, some comrades have raised opinions on inappropriate selection of materials, such as the unclear themes of "A Seed" and "Mr. Dongguo and the Wolf", and that "The Red Army Arrived at Yangjiawa" and "The Characters on the Donkey's Face" are not suitable for primary school teaching materials. Some comrades have also pointed out that the introduction of new words is reversed, omitted, or repeated. We have copied and stored them by volume and category for reference and basis during revision.

    Many comrades have also pointed out errors in the texts and punctuation of primary and secondary school Chinese textbooks. We will correct these errors in the reprint.

            Secondly, let's talk about history textbooks.

    Among the opinions on textbooks we have seen and received, a total of thirty-six articles are about history, of which twenty-nine are about national history. Everyone's attention to national history teaching materials is due to the fact that our published history teaching materials have many shortcomings and errors, and also reflects everyone's love for national history. Everyone's opinions can be divided into three aspects: belonging to viewpoints and methods, belonging to materials, and belonging to writing techniques.

    In terms of viewpoints, many comrades pointed out that our textbooks are written according to the viewpoint of historical materialism and according to the laws of social development. We did have such intentions when compiling them. However, our cultivation of historical materialism is not enough, and we cannot fully grasp historical materials, so that there are many serious errors in viewpoints in our teaching materials.

    Mr. Li Houze pointed out that our primary school history teaching materials do not implement patriotism education enough. He said: "We should awaken children's love for heroes by telling the specific historical facts of great peasant leaders and national heroes in Chinese history, and then cultivate children's noble qualities of patriotism. We all know that children's respect for heroes is particularly strong and true, and children especially like to read and listen to biographies and stories of heroes of the motherland. Therefore, teaching the great deeds of national heroes makes children's understanding and memory of history more effective than simply narrating the social situation at that time and a bunch of historical facts. For example, when talking about foreign insults in the Song Dynasty, we should focus on the story of Yue Fei and point out that Yue Fei's failure was due to the surrender and betrayal of the country by the ruling class, big bureaucrats, and big landlords, so that children can clearly understand Yue Fei's love and the shamelessness and crimes of the ruling class." He also sternly pointed out that we forgot the "anti-imperialist struggle of the Sanyuanli Pingying Group" when talking about the Opium War, which is a major mistake. The teachers in Guangzhou also pointed out that in the third volume of primary school history, "there is not much description of the atrocities of American imperialism against China," and "when talking about the failure of the Taiping Army, it was not pointed out that the Qing government colluded with the forces of imperialism." Mr. Zhang Yunhe said when criticizing our *Senior Middle School Chinese History* for lacking ideological materials: "There are many excellent sciences, literature, arts, and philosophies in Chinese history... Senior high school students need to understand the cultural progress in their history." These opinions are all correct. In our history teaching materials, the face of Chinese historical development is not fully and vividly depicted with great events, great figures, and great creations in Chinese history, in order to stimulate students' patriotism. This is the first ideological error that should be pointed out.

    Mr. Zhang Yunhe also pointed out that our middle school history teaching materials do not have "systematic explanations of the ethnic groups of the past dynasties," and "when talking about the relationship between ethnic groups, it is not easy to connect them together." "Many strange ethnic names are only mentioned in each chapter, but the origin and relationship of each ethnic group are not mentioned, making it difficult for readers to figure out, as if these ethnic groups appeared suddenly." Mr. Niu Weiding and Mr. Zhang Yunhe made the same criticism, pointing out that our history teaching materials cannot enable students to "correctly understand the history of all Chinese ethnic groups and their interrelationships." He also said, "There are many ethnic discriminations and prejudices in past Chinese classics." If they are quoted without criticism, it is "easy to fall into the quagmire of great ethnic consciousness and narrow ethnic consciousness." In his article *Muhammad's Sword*, Mr. Ma Jian more sternly pointed out the inappropriate narration in the *Junior Middle School Foreign History Textbook*. These opinions are also correct. Our national history teaching materials have too few descriptions of the history of various ethnic groups.

    Mr. Niu Weiding criticized us for not making good use of Chinese historical facts to illustrate the various stages of Chinese historical development, and "not giving due attention to the productive forces that play a decisive role in social development." Mr. Zhang Yunhe pointed out: "History textbooks should focus on historical events and figures, and regard social economic conditions and systems as the basic driving force of historical development, and narrate them in occasions related to historical events. In this way, we can understand the progress of all aspects of society. It is not possible to achieve teaching goals by narrating social and economic conditions in a flat and static way." He checked the *Senior Middle School Chinese History* with this standard and said: "The upper volume has two volumes and fifty-two sections, almost more than half of which are analyzed social and institutional. Six of the eight sections in the Spring and Autumn History, four of the six sections in the Warring States History, and five of the seven sections in the Southern and Northern Dynasties History are about society and institutions." Mr. Xiao Guozhen pointed out when criticizing the *Junior Middle School Chinese History Textbook* that there are too few specific historical facts in the book, and too many abstract narratives and conclusions. "For example, in the third paragraph of the twelfth section 'Another Peasant Uprising and Another Han Dynasty', 'The Struggle within the Ruling Class' talks about the struggle between foreign relatives and eunuchs (page 40). In the narrative of the long struggle of one hundred years, no facts are mentioned, only a formula of the cyclical struggle between foreign relatives and eunuchs is explained. In the first paragraph of the twenty-third section 'The Decline of Tang and the Re-Split of China and the Invasion of Foreign Ethnic Groups (Middle)', 'The Internal Struggle of the Central Government' is only four short lines, which are used to explain the origin of the eunuchs' acquisition of military power and the situation of the eunuchs' abolition and the party struggle of the ministers (page 75). As a result, there is not a single sentence that students will understand without detailed explanation." Mr. Chen Xunnian also pointed out when criticizing the same book that "the key to the transition from one historical stage or one dynasty to another is too brief in some places." After Mr. Zhang Yunhe made a statistic of the sentences mentioning the year in the *Senior Middle School Chinese History Volume*, he said: "The above excerpts 31 examples, and roughly all the sentences mentioning the year in this book are excerpted. In addition to the AD year at the beginning of each chapter indicating a certain dynasty and a certain time, there are only a few thirty places in a history textbook indicating the year." "The whole book does not take the AD calendar as a clue, sometimes AD, sometimes era name, sometimes a certain emperor's year, especially the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, AD, the Zhou Tianzi's year, the Lu History Chronicle, and the years of the vassal states of Qin and Song are mixed together, blurring the years of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States." These opinions pointed out a serious shortcoming in the writing method of our history teaching materials. We cannot narrate history in a vivid and interesting way. We have not narrated the most important historical facts clearly, have not narrated history with the characteristics of historical figures, and have not seriously told historical events in chronological order.

    Regarding material errors, such as historical facts, years, people, place names, and numbers, we have made many corrections thanks to the corrections from all parties within the possible scope. In this regard, the enthusiasm and concern of all comrades is especially worthy of our gratitude. Some teachers listed the errors one by one and proposed corrections, and some teachers made detailed textual research on a person's name, place name, and number, and put forward valuable information. Due to space limitations, we cannot explain them one by one.

    There are also many criticisms from all parties on the text of history teaching materials. Mr. Xiao Guozhen criticized the text of the *Junior Middle School Chinese History Textbook* as "difficult and dry, more difficult to read than Chinese." Mr. Jiang Guanwu criticized the *Senior Middle School Chinese History* as "stiff in sentence structure, simply an ancient Chinese writing style." Mr. Liu Baishan criticized the *High School History Textbook* as "too deep in writing and dry in narrative." The students' response to middle and primary school history teaching materials is "more difficult to understand than Chinese." The reason why the text is difficult to read, in addition to the problem of the text itself, Mr. Xiao pointed out: "The content included in an extremely short lesson is too much, and the explanation has to be brief. In order to save words, it will naturally become difficult." Mr. Li Jiaji further pointed out that the *Senior Middle School Chinese History* is a abridged version of the *A Brief History of China*, and the *Junior Middle School Chinese History Textbook* is a summary of the *A Brief History of China*. The first two volumes of the *High School History Textbook* can be said to be the most tightly abridged version of the *A Brief History of China*, and the latter two volumes are a chronicle of major events in modern Chinese history. The lower the level of the school, the more compressed the content of the history textbook used, and the more difficult it is to understand the text. Many teachers pointed out that there are too few charts and graphs in our history teaching materials, which is not easy to arouse students' interest. This opinion is also worth noting.

    None of the existing history teaching materials are satisfactory. We are planning to rewrite or revise them. However, the work of rewriting and revising cannot be completed all at once. Before the new teaching materials come out, the old teaching materials still need to be used, because there are no other teaching materials to choose from at present. No matter how many errors and shortcomings this set of history teaching materials has, it is much better than the old history teaching materials, because it does attempt to write from the perspective of historical materialism, and it does reflect some of the real situation of Chinese history.

            Finally, let's talk about geography textbooks.

    A total of thirteen articles of criticism on geography textbooks have been seen, which can be roughly summarized into the following aspects: about thought, about the order of teaching materials, about illustrations, and about material errors.

    Opinions on viewpoints are mainly concentrated on the *High School Geography Textbook*. Mr. Bu Yi pointed out that in our *High School Geography* Volume 4, when talking about the United States, "we should not quote statistical materials from I don't know how many years ago to promote the strong productivity of American imperialism to children, which objectively leads to bad consequences." "Exaggerating the material civilization of the United States cannot correctly help elementary school students improve their confidence in the growing strength of the peace and democracy camp." When talking about the countries in South America, it only said that Argentina is a major obstacle to the democratic and peaceful road in South America, without pointing out that the biggest enemy of the South American people is American imperialism. "When mentioning the struggle of the Vietnamese people against French imperialism, it only said in a hollow way that 'the Vietnamese people are struggling', without specifically pointing out that the Vietnamese people have liberated 90% of the territory." He criticized our description of the prosperity of Shanghai after it was opened as a commercial port: "This passage is so calm and so bland, without showing the fact that Shanghai has been deformed under the cruel aggression of imperialism for a hundred years." Mr. Shen Zuohan criticized the *Junior Middle School National Geography Textbook* and said: "Within two or three years, about two-thirds of the country will carry out land reform. This is a great and arduous national task. Chairman Mao once said that this is a basic condition for fundamentally improving our financial and economic situation. In geography textbooks, when talking about the Northeast and North China, it is natural to talk about the role of land reform in improving the industrial construction of the Northeast and North China, the living standards of the people, the development of culture and education, and the financial work and economic situation of the government. But this book does not mention it at all (only in the last chapter with a sentence), which can not be said to be a defect." These criticisms show that our geography teaching materials do not pay enough attention to ideological and political education, and we should seriously pay attention to it in the future.

    In the past, physical geography was taught in the second semester of the third year of high school. We believe that students have learned general geography and regional geography in senior elementary school and junior high school. Next, comprehensively learning the basic knowledge of physical geography should improve the learning of national geography and foreign geography on this basis, so we arranged physical geography in the first semester of the first year of high school. Regarding this arrangement, we have received two different opinions. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education suggested: "Some schools believe that the physical geography of the first year of high school is generally too complicated. Students lack a three-dimensional concept, and it is difficult to feel practical in the teaching process, but students do not gain much. Physical geography seems to be more suitable for teaching after the second year of high school." Mr. Qu Jiazhang suggested: "Regarding the issue of teaching physical geography in the first year of high school, some friends said that in terms of the current stage of teachers, this arrangement is not feasible in many schools. This is probably because the editors imagined that the current geography teachers are all graduates of the university geography department or the history and geography department, so that the objective facts are ignored. We should know that there are still many laymen among middle school geography teachers!" However, the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Education put forward a different opinion: "The arrangement of high school geography teaching materials: teaching physical geography in the first semester of the first year of high school, national geography in the second semester and the second year, and world geography in the third year. We think this order is very scientific." We arranged physical geography in the first semester of the first year of high school based only on the conclusions obtained from discussions with colleagues and a few teachers. We did not solicit the opinions of more geography teachers. The new curriculum standards are being drafted. Which stage is the most suitable for arranging physical geography will have to be left to the new curriculum standards to solve.

    The various parties also raised opinions on the fact that the high school geography teaching materials are not arranged in the order of large administrative regions. Mr. Bu Yi said: "The division of large administrative regions is a major event in the democratic construction of the new China, and Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an, in addition to their original importance, should be added to the name of the capital of the large administrative region... For example, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have not established provincial people's governments, but are divided into four administrative offices equivalent to provinces: Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Northern Anhui. In this way, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Wuhu, and Hefei have become the first cities in the administrative region." This kind of textbook is based on the old liberated area textbooks. Because we wanted to save trouble, we did not adjust the textbooks as a whole, so this shortcoming was formed.

    Many opinions were also raised on the illustrations. Mr. Shen Zuohan criticized the *Junior Middle School National Geography Textbook* and said: "The map pages are too small to see clearly. In addition, the mountains are too thick and complicated, and the provincial boundaries are not obvious enough, which cannot make students clear at a glance or easily obtain a comprehensive and clear impression." In addition to pointing out some omissions in the illustrations in our high school geography, Mr. Ji Tongyao also gave a general criticism: "Not clear enough." The illustrations in the geography textbook are an important tool for conducting geography teaching. The illustrations in our teaching materials should be improved.

    Regarding the errors in the materials in our geography textbooks, we have corrected many places in time due to the careful instructions of all parties. It is especially worth mentioning that Mr. Yi Yiqu, in addition to listing some opinions and sending them directly to us, also sent opinions to *Book Review*. Such enthusiasm moved us.

    Of course, the biggest problem in geography teaching materials is that we have too few newly compiled textbooks. The textbooks used in the second year of junior high school and the third year of high school are not newly compiled by us. So far, there are no suitable replacement teaching materials to choose from for the second year of high school.

    As a textbook publisher, the most severe criticism we have received is that textbooks cannot be supplied in time. Some textbooks often cannot reach students long after school starts, especially in remote areas in the southwest and northwest. Some places have to wait until the semester is about to end before they are shipped, and some places are still using the teaching materials of the Kuomintang ruling era. Because of the untimely supply, teachers blame us, students blame us, and students' parents blame us. They blame us for being incompetent and irresponsible. For these accusations, we don’t need to explain our difficulties too much. We are willing to repay the supervision of all parties with doubled efforts, and are willing to do our best to gradually reduce the accusations of all parties.

    Editor's note: The *Book Review* of this newspaper published an announcement in the 15th and 16th issues of the *Book Review* to solicit opinions on middle and primary school textbooks, requesting teachers and other educators from all over the country to criticize and discuss these newly compiled and revised textbooks, so as to provide a basis for future improvements. After the announcement was published, a total of thirty-two pieces of correspondence were successively received. These articles should have been published in the *Book Review* earlier, but they were delayed because they were forwarded to the "People's Education Publishing House" (which was reorganized from the First Department of the Publishing Administration, the Huabei United Publishing House, and the Shanghai United Publishing House) for reference. Since January of this year, the two supplements, *Book Review* and *News Work*, have been merged into *Book and Newspaper Review*, and the nature has changed. It is impossible to publish the above-mentioned correspondence for a while. Now, the "People's Education Publishing House" has made a general response to the criticisms and opinions of all parties in this issue. In the future, we will still select and publish some of the more representative opinions. Those that cannot be published will be answered and thanked individually by the "People's Education Publishing House" at a later date. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and apologies to the enthusiastic friends who have contributed from all over the country.

　　敬答各方面对于教科书的批评
　　人民教育出版社
    对于一九五○年秋季的中小学语文、历史、地理教科书的批评和指正，经我们看到的，有以下几类。
    第一类是登载在报纸和杂志上的，计有上海大公报二十二篇，光明日报、新教育、东北教育各两篇，人民日报、长江日报、松江教育、湖南教师各一篇，共三十二篇。
    第二类是我们在《人民日报》的《图书评论》刊载了征求批评教科书的意见的启事之后，各方面写给《图书评论》的，共收到三十二件。
    第三类是直接把批评的意见寄给我们的，到现在为止，共收到二十三件。
    对于所有写文章写信的同志们，我们诚恳的表示感激。我们的工作做得粗疏，由于同志们的帮助，得以纠正一些，改善一些，这应当感激。学生们读的是些距离完善还远的教科书，由于同志们的帮助，得以或多或少的减少那个距离，这尤其应当感激。我们人手少，不能够赶早给同志们去信，除了表示感激而外，再把我们怎样接受批评，怎样另有意见，怎样心有余而力不足，详详细细的说一番。现在先在这篇文章里总说一说，希望同志们都能看到这篇文章，并且能鉴谅我们的不得已。
    为求头绪清楚起见，我们分语文、历史、地理三个方面来说。
            先说语文教科书。
    对于语文教科书的批评文字，共看到三十八篇，可分中学与小学两方面来分别答复。
    解放以后，大部分地区采用的中学语文教科书有两套：一套是新华书店出版的王食山编的《初中国文》和周静等编的《高中国文》，一套是新华书店出版的宋云彬等编的《初中语文课本》和周祖谟等编的《高中语文课本》。后一套从一九五○年的秋季到一九五一年的春季陆续出齐，前一套从一九五一年春季起不再出版。因此，我们单就关于后一套的意见来说。
    按同志们的意见分析起来，大约有以下几方面：关于教材的选择的，关于教材的排列的，关于注释的，关于帮助教学进行的提示的。
    教材的选择是编辑语文教科书的主要工作，编得好不好，就看选得适当不适当。选材的标准，一方面要求内容充实，通过内容来完成思想政治教育的任务，一方面要求表达形式完美，通过表达形式来完成语文教育的任务。我们认定了这个标准，做出来的成绩可不尽合标准，见到的和做到的不能够完全一致。《大公报》的《笔谈》上就曾经提出来说：《高中语文课本》的选材，第一册比较好，第三册差些，第五册更差。《初中语文课本》的选材，也有人提出，如第二册的《屈原》，第三册的《蚕和蚂蚁》，都不十分适当。又如高中第一册的《雨来没有死》，刘三先生就指出这篇文章写作上的许多缺点，不是应该入选的作品。这些意见很宝贵，我们愿意接受，将来重编的时候一定要调整。现在为了供应及时，除了做一些必要的订正之外，还来不及重编。希望教师们在讲授那些不很适合的选文的时候，加以分析，加以批判，那么学生们还是会受益的。
    在语文课本里，翻译文章是否应该入选，如果可以选，分量应该占多少，也有人提出这样的问题来。君健、陆丹林两位先生就提出译文分量太多，而且有些译文译笔欠佳，词句费解，主张不宜多选。玄常先生认为译文应该选，从译文中可以吸收外国的语汇、语法和精密的表现方法。我们认为这两方面的意见是可以互相补充的。就译文在教材中所占的分量说，我们选的译文确实多了一些，而且有的译文就文字上说，并不完全适合作范文。
    关于选读文言，各方面的意见颇不一致。有的说高中根本不应该教文言，有的又说不应该从二年级教起，应该从一年级教起；有的嫌我们选得太多，有的又嫌选得太少。我们认为浅近的文言，高中还是应该选读一些，选读的目的“在使学生明确地了解文言跟现代口语的异同，养成阅读文言参考书的初步能力”（《高中语文课本》编辑大意）。当然选的篇幅不能过多，而且文字也不能过深。我们感到我们选的文言有些太古典了些，如《战于郎》跟《杜诗三首》（第五册）。
    选择适于做语文教材的文章是不容易的。我们知道的不多，见到的不广，鉴别力又不够，希望教师们多多给我们帮助。
    教材的排列，我们也没有做好。除了选文的深浅不尽适合各年级的程度以外，主要的是先后次序、单元配合不能完全惬当。王世民先生提出“每一个学期的教材要假定一个重心，有计划有系统地来选”。这个意见，我们仔细研究过，认为这样做法基本上是对的。但是重心不可能只有一个。因为同一个学期的教材，要照顾到内容和文体的多样性，只能做到一册里的教材分隶几个单元，每个单元之中的选文要互相发明，互相参证，各个单元之间又要有联系，能从前一部分的教材引发后一部分的教材，在“多样”中力求有关联，有组织，不至于成为活叶文选的汇订本。这个标准，我们没有达到。至于怎样明定每一册的重点，各册之间怎样相互联络，循序渐进，我们是考虑到的，但是没有成熟，还不能想得明确。我们恳切地希望得到各方的指示。
    在注释方面，我们做得粗略（《高中语文课本》更因为赶着及时出版，还没有加注释）。哪些应该加注，哪些不必加，辨别得不够仔细。哪些应该详注，哪些略注就可以了，也考虑得不够周到。关于这些，将来重编的时候都应该订正。注释里有作者介绍一项，有些作者我们没法查考，只好从略。教师们就有写信来询问的。我们认为除了专门从事著述的作家应该比较详尽的介绍以外，对于其他的作者即使不知道他的经历，在教学进行上并没有多大妨碍。这个意见，不知道对不对。
    为什么要学习某一篇文章，学习那篇文章应该注意些什么，应该得到些什么，都是教师必须掌握的。为了帮助教师掌握这些问题，我们在《初中语文课本》每篇选文之后附有《思考、讨论、练习》的材料（《高中语文课本》还没有做）。由于分册编辑，赶着出版，所以就全套看起来，这些材料就见得散漫，零碎，没有一贯的系统。有的没有把重要的地方给指出来，有的牵涉太广，不免支蔓。这些缺点，将来都要订正。关于语法的提示，没有系统的编排，北京温泉中学景地先生曾经向我们提出意见。对于语法教学，我们认为需要另编教材来进行，才容易收到效果，现在正在考虑中。
    小学语文课本，大部分地区是采用华北新华书店出版刘松涛等编的《初小国语》和《高小国语》。这一套教科书是一九四八年三月出版的，后来经过华北人民政府教育部教科书编审委员会跟中央人民政府出版总署编审局加以好几次的修订。修订的时候，有的地方是订正个别的错误，有的地方是调换一部分材料，工作做得很枝节；又为着迁就生字搭配的关系，有的地方就不免牵强。因此，几次的修订都没有从全书的精神上体例上材料上来作全盘的考虑。这一套教科书的缺点是很多的。
    这一套教科书取材偏重农村生活。原因是这套书最初是供华北解放区学校用的（初版时北京尚未解放），为着结合实际，多取乡村的教材。后来城市的学校也采用，就感到不尽适合，好些词汇、名物、生活习惯，城市的教师和学生教学上都感到难于了解。同时，编写用的语言不仅是北方话，而且有许多流行区域较狭的方言土语。华北西北的学校对这些方言土语问题还小，华东、中南、西南区的学校就没法解释，造成教学进行上的大障碍。我们就曾经收到过好些来询问这些方言土语怎样诠注的信。
    对于这两个问题——教材偏重乡村生活，生僻的方言土语，我们在供应一九五一年秋季开学用的课本的修订上，正在努力求得解决。一方面把一些区域性很强的仅属于个别农村情况的材料加以淘汰，另换比较一般性的材料，生僻的方言土语加以删除，不能删除的加上注解。
    小学语文课本的教材排列，为着联系实际，有些地方必须跟时间节令相配合。这一套书是就春季始业来排列教材的。秋季始业的学校采用，就感到教学上的困难，国庆纪念、儿童节等，教学的时候不能配合节日的活动，自然界的变化不能在适当的季节进行教学，给学生以实际观察的条件。我们接到的意见当中，提出这个问题来的也很多。要解决这个问题，惟有分编两套课本来适应春季始业跟秋季始业的不同需要。我们有这样的拟议：想把这一套书修订后专供春季始业的学校用，另外把原来上海联合出版社出版的一套加以修订，专供秋季始业的学校用。这个拟议，正向中央教育部提出，请求指示。
    此外还有一些同志提出关于选材不当的意见，如《一粒种子》《东郭先生和狼》等主题不明确，《红军到了杨家洼》《驴脸上的字》等不宜于作小学教材，又有一些同志替我们指出生字的提出有前后倒置的，有遗漏或重复的，我们都分册分类抄存，用作修订时的参考和依据。
    许多同志还指出了中小学语文课本上文字、标点上的错误，这些错误我们在重版时均要改正。
            其次说历史教科书。
    在我们看到的收到的对于教科书的意见中，关于历史方面的共三十六篇，其中有二十九篇是关于本国史的。大家这样的注意本国历史教材，一方面固然由于我们出版的历史教材缺点多，错误多，一方面也表现了大家对本国历史的热爱。大家的意见可以分为三个方面，属于观点和方法的，属于材料的，属于写作技术的。
    在观点方面，许多同志指出，我们的课本是按照唯物史观的观点写的，按照社会发展的规律写的。我们在编写时也确实有这样的存心。但是我们历史唯物论的修养不够，我们对史料不能全面掌握，以致我们的教材中有了不少严重的观点上的错误。
    李厚泽先生指出我们小学历史教材对爱国主义教育贯彻得不够。他说：“我们应该通过讲述中国历史上的伟大农民领袖、民族英雄的具体史实来唤起儿童对英雄的热爱，进而培养儿童们爱国主义的高贵品质。我们都清楚：儿童对英雄的敬爱是特别强烈而真实的，儿童对祖国英雄的传记、故事是特别喜欢阅读和倾听的。所以通过讲授民族英雄的伟大事迹使儿童对历史的了解和记忆比平铺直叙当时社会情况和一堆史实来得更有教育效果。例如讲宋代的外侮，我们就应该以岳飞的故事为中心来论述，指出岳飞的失败是由于统治阶级大官僚大地主的投降卖国，使儿童们对岳飞挚爱，对统治阶级的无耻和罪恶认识得更清楚。”他还严正地指出，我们讲鸦片战争，“把三元里平英团人民反帝的斗争忘记了”，是一个重大的错误。广州市的教师们更指出，小学历史第三册中，“对美帝侵略中国暴行的材料叙述得不多”，“在讲述太平军失败时，没有指出是由于满清政府勾结了帝国主义势力”。张允和先生在批评我们的《高中中国历史》中没有意识形态方面的材料时说：“中国历史上有许多优良的科学、文学、艺术、哲学，……高中同学，需要了解自己的历史上文化进展的情况。”这些意见都是正确的。在我们的历史教材中，没有充分以中国历史上的伟大事变、伟大人物、伟大创造来具体生动地刻画出中国历史发展的面貌，以激发学生的爱国热忱，这是首先应该指出来的观点上的错误。
    张允和先生又指出，我们的中学历史教材中对于“历代各民族没有系统的说明”，“讲到各民族的关系，不容易叫人连系得起来”，“在各章节中只说到许多奇怪的民族名字，而没有说出各民族的渊源和关系，使读者摸不清头绪，好象这些民族是突然出现的”。牛维鼎先生与张允和先生提出同样的批评，他指出我们的历史教材不能够使学生“正确地了解中国各兄弟民族的历史及其相互关系”，他并且说，“中国过去的典籍记载，存在着很多民族歧视和偏见”，如果不批判的来引用，就“很容易陷入大民族意识及狭隘的民族意识的泥潭”。马坚先生在他的《穆罕默德的宝剑》一文中，更严正地指出《初中外国历史课本》叙述得不恰当之处。这些意见，也都是正确的。我们的本国历史教材，对于各兄弟民族的历史叙述得实在太少了。
    牛维鼎先生批评我们没有很好的运用中国史实来说明中国历史发展的各个阶段，“对于在社会发展上起决定作用的生产力，没有给以应有的注意。”张允和先生指出：“历史教科书应以历史事件、人物为主，把社会经济情况和制度等等问题作为历史发展的基本动力，在和历史事件相关联的场合来讲述。这样才可以了解社会各方面的进展。不是平面的静止的讲述社会经济状况就能够达成教学目标的。”他以这个标准来检查了一下《高中中国历史》说：“上册两编共五十二节，几乎一半以上是分析社会与制度的。春秋史中八节有六节，战国史中六节有四节，南北朝史中七节有五节是讲述社会与制度的。”萧果忱先生在批评《初中中国历史课本》时指出书中具体史实说得太少，抽象的叙述和结论太多。“如第十二节‘另一个农民起义和另一个汉朝’的第三段‘统治阶级内部的斗争’中讲外戚与宦官的斗争（页四○），在一百年的长期斗争的叙述中，竟没有提到一点事实，只说明了一个外戚太监循环斗争的公式。第二十三节‘唐的衰亡与中国再分裂及外族侵入（中）’的第一段‘中央政府的内争’，仅仅短短四行，用它说明太监得到兵权的由来，宦官废立和大臣们党争的情形（页七五），结果没有一句不经详细解释学生就会明白的话。”陈旭年先生在批评同书时也指出，“从一个历史阶段或一个王朝到另一个历史阶段和王朝的转变关键，有些地方写得太简略”。张允和先生把《高中中国历史上册》中讲到年代的句子作了一个统计之后，说：“以上摘录了三十一例，此书中讲到年代的句子大致都节录了下来。除了每章前面的公元年代表明某朝某时外，一本历史教科书只有三十几处表明年代是不够的。”“全书没有拿公元纪年作为线索，一会儿公元，一会儿年号，一会儿某帝几年，尤其春秋战国，公元，周天子几年，鲁史纪年，又有秦宋诸侯的纪年，把春秋战国列国的年代混淆在一处。”这些意见指出了我们的历史教材的写作方法上的一个严重缺点，我们不能用生动有趣的方式来叙述历史，没有把最重要的史实叙述清楚，没有以历史人物的特点来叙述历史，没有认真按照历史年代的次序讲述历史事件。
    属于材料方面的错误的，如史实、年代、人民、地名、数字等，承各方面指正很多，我们已在可能范围内加以改正。在这方面，各位同志的热心与关怀是特别值得我们感谢的。有的先生逐一开列错误，并提出改正意见，有的先生为了一个人名、地名、数字作了详细的考证，提出了宝贵的资料。因限于篇幅，恕我们不能一一说明了。
    对于历史教材的文字，各方批评也很多。萧果忱先生批评《初中中国历史课本》文字“艰深干燥，比国文还难读”，姜观吾先生批评《高中中国历史》“句法生硬，简直是古文笔法”，刘拜山先生批评《高小历史课本》“文字太深，叙述枯燥”。中小学历史教材在学生方面的反映是“比国文还难懂”。文字难读的原因，除了文字本身的问题以外，萧先生指出：“在一课极简短的课文中，包括的内容太多，说明就不得不简，为了节省文字，自然就要艰深起来。”李家骥先生更指出，《高中中国历史》是《中国通史简编》的缩本，《初中中国历史课本》则是《中国通史简编》的提要。《高小历史课本》的前两册，更可以说是《中国通史简编》缩得最紧的缩本，后两册则是中国近代史的大事记。程度愈低的学校所用的历史课本内容愈压缩，文字当然就愈不容易懂。许多教师指出我们的历史教材中各种图表太少，不易启发学生的兴趣，这个意见也是值得重视的。
    现有的历史教材，没有一本是令人满意的，我们正计划重编或修改。但是重编与修改的工作，不是一下子可以完成的，在新教材没有出来以前，旧的教材仍然需要采用，因为在当前再没有另外的教材可以选用了。这套历史教材的错误和缺点再多，可是比旧历史教材总好得多，因为它究竟是企图用唯物史观的观点写的，它究竟反映了中国历史的一些真实情况。
            最后说地理教科书。
    对于地理教科书的批评，共看到十三篇文章，大致可归纳成以下几个方面：关于思想的，关于教材编排次序的，关于插图的，关于材料错误的。
    关于观点方面的意见，主要的集中在《高小地理课本》上。卜一先生指出我们的《高小地理》第四册，讲美国“不应该引用不晓得几年以前的统计材料，向小孩子宣传美国帝国主义生产力的强大，客观上招致不良的后果”。“夸张了美国的物质文明，就不能正确的帮助小学生提高对和平民主阵营力量日趋强大的信心”。在讲述南美洲各国时，只说阿根廷是南美民主和平道路上的一个大障碍，没有指明南美人民的最大敌人正是美帝国主义。“提到越南人民反对法帝国主义的斗争，只是空洞的说‘越南人民正在斗争’，没有具体指出越南人民已经解放了百分之九十的国土。”他批评我们对上海辟为商埠后的繁荣时的叙述说：“这一段叙述，是那么冷静，那么平淡，丝毫没有表现上海一百年来在帝国主义残酷的侵略下畸形发展起来的事实。”沈作汉先生对于《初中本国地理课本》批评说：“在两三年之内，约占全国三分之二以上的地区将先后进行土地改革。这是全国性的一个伟大的艰巨工作，毛主席曾说这是使我们的财政经济状况根本好转的一个基本条件。在地理课本中，讲述东北与华北的时候，很自然的可以谈到土地改革对东北与华北的工业建设、人民生活水准的提高，文化、教育的发展，以及政府财政工作与经济状况的好转所起的作用。但这本书上竟没有提到（只在最后一章带上一句），不能不说是一个缺陷。”这些批评表现了我们的地理教材在进行思想政治教育上注意得太不够，以后我们该严重的注意。
    在过去，自然地理安排在高中三年级下期讲授。我们认为学生在高级小学和初级中学已经学了一般地理和区域地理，接下去综合学习自然地理的基本知识，该可以在这个基础上把本国地理和外国地理的学习提高一步，所以就把自然地理安排在高中一年上期了。关于这样编排，我们得到了两种不同的意见。北京市文教局提出的意见说：“有个别学校认为高一的自然地理，一般说来内容太繁。学生缺乏立体观念，在教学过程中实感费力，学生收益却不多。自然地理似宜到高二以后再讲。”屈家璋先生提出的意见说：“关于高一上讲自然地理的问题。朋友接谈间，有些人认为就现在阶段的师资看，这样安排在有不少学校是行不通的。这大概由于编者心目中所想象的现在的地理教师，都是大学地理系或者史地系毕业的，以致把客观的事实忽视了。应该知道现在中学地理教师还有很多是外行呀！”但是沈阳市教育局却提出了不同的意见：“高中地理教材的排列：在高中一年级上期讲自然地理，下期和二年级讲本国地理，三年级讲世界地理，这种顺序，我们认为很科学。”我们把自然地理安排在高一上期，仅凭了同人和少数教师讨论得到的结论，的确没有征求过更多的地理教师的意见。新的课程标准正在拟议中，自然地理到底安排在哪一阶段最合适，只好留待新的课程标准去解决。
    高小地理教材没有按大行政区的次序排列，各方面也提出了意见。卜一先生说：“大行政区的划分是新中国民主建政的一件大事，而上海、武汉、重庆、西安等地除了原有的重要性之外，应加上大行政区首府的名义。……又如江苏、安徽两省，现在都没有设立省人民政府，而划分为相当于省的苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北四个行政公署。这样，无锡、扬州、芜湖、合肥就成了行政区的首邑。”这一种课本是根据以前老解放区的课本改的，因为我们图省事，没有把课文全盘调动，以致形成了这个缺点。
    对于插图提的意见也很多。沈作汉先生批评《初中本国地理课本》说：“地图版面太小，不容易看清楚，再加上山脉划得太粗、太复杂，省界也太不明显，不能使学生一目了然，也不易获得全面的清晰的印象。”嵇同耀先生除了指出我们高小地理附图中的一些疏忽之处以外，并给了一个概括的批评：“不够清晰”。地理教本的附图中，是进行地理教学中的一种重要工具，我们的教材中的插图，还应该力求改进。
    对于我们的地理课本中的材料的错误，由于各方的细心指示，有许多处我们已及时改正了。这中间特别值得提出的是易宜曲先生，他除了表列了一些意见直接寄给我们之外，又向《书报评论》寄了意见。这样的热忱，使我们感动。
    当然，地理教材中最大的问题还是我们新编成的课本太少。现在初二和高三用的课本，都不是我们新编的。高二到现在为止还没有适当的代用教材可选。
    作为教科书的出版者来说，我们受到的最严厉的批评是教科书不能及时供应。有些教科书，往往在开学很久还不能达到学生手里，特别是在西南与西北的偏僻地区，有的地方要到学期快终了方才运到，个别地方还在用国民党统治时代的教材。为了供应不及时，教师责难我们，学生责难我们，学生的家长责难我们，他们责难我们无能，责难我们不负责任。对于这些责难，我们用不着拿我们的困难来多加解释，我们愿意以加倍的努力来答谢各方的督促，愿意尽我们最大的可能来逐步减少各方的责难。
    编者按：本报前《图书评论》两周刊于第十五、十六两期中，连续刊登为征求对中小学教科书批评意见启事，请求各地教师及其他教育工作者对这些新编和改订的课本加以批评和讨论，借供以后改进的依据。启事刊出以后，陆续收到稿件共计三十二件。这些文章，早应在《图书评论》择要发表，后来因为转送给“人民教育出版社”（该社是由出版总署编审局第一处、华北联合出版社、上海联合出版社改组成功的）参考，以致延搁了下来。从本年一月起，《图书评论》与《新闻工作》两种副刊合并为《书报评论》，性质有所变更，对于上述稿件一时无法刊出。现在先由“人民教育出版社”对各方面的批评和意见，在本期里作了一个总的答复。以后仍当选择较有代表性的意见刊登一部分。未能刊出的，稍缓当由“人民教育出版社”个别答复并致谢。最后谨向各地热心投稿的朋友们致衷心的感谢与歉意。
