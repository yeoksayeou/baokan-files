    Opposing Incorrect Literary Criticism
    To the Editor:
    I was deeply moved by Mr. Lao She's article "Talking About the Play 'Fang Pearl'" in the 31st issue of the Literary Gazette.

    Mr. Lao She's play is basically an excellent work, but it also has obvious shortcomings. These shortcomings are caused by incorrect literary criticism.

    Mr. Lao She's article states that his original plan for the play was to write it in four acts. The first three acts would depict Fang Pearl, an artist who was trampled on and had no way out in the old society, and the group of people around her. The last act would depict her ecstasy after liberation, "teaching her to see the light and become a typical character." As a result of "friends' advice," the plan was changed. After the third act, many new problems encountered by the artists were suddenly raised, including the issue of going to the countryside, which Comrade Zhong Dianfei had criticized. The original fourth act was reluctantly stretched into two acts. "Thus, there was inconsistency between the beginning and the end. When the play closed, there was no overall, natural, and powerful effect, which disappointed the audience."

    Mr. Lao She selected a correct theme, was full of political and artistic enthusiasm, fully familiar with the characters and environment in the play, and had sufficient dramatic talent to express this "typical character in a typical environment." However, he failed to fully achieve his wishes and left two important shortcomings in the work, which he himself justly pointed out. Why did all this happen? How can it be remedied? What is the lesson to be learned? We should not let these questions go.

    The previous issue of "People's Literature" republished the resolution of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1925 on literary policy, which is beneficial to the development of correct literary criticism in our country. But in fact, simply publishing resolutions, no matter how many, will not automatically solve any problems. We should use these resolutions to examine and improve our own work. The resolution states:

    "The Party should adopt the following position towards proletarian writers: to help their growth by all means, to support them and their organizations in every way, and at the same time to prevent the most harmful phenomenon of Communist affectation from appearing among them by all means. Precisely because they are regarded as the future ideological leaders of Soviet literature, the Party should fight by all means against the frivolous and contemptuous attitude towards the old cultural heritage and literary experts."

    "Communist criticism should avoid using a commanding tone in literature. This criticism can only be deeply educational when it relies on the superiority of its own ideas. Marxist criticism should drive out arrogant, half-baked, and smug Communist affectation from its ranks. Marxist criticism should set itself the slogan of 'learning' and should combat all nonsense and drivel among its ranks."

    "The Party should eradicate by all means attempts at arbitrary and incompetent administrative interference in literary affairs." These guidelines are so close to us today! We also need the same guidelines. Then, let us look at the story of the "Fang Pearl" play from this perspective. Among Mr. Lao She's friends, are there also people who are putting on Communist airs as mentioned here? Should they conduct a self-examination as a result of this document's reminder? I believe that only when this kind of self-examination occurs can it prove that the publication of such documents has repercussions and meaning.

    Moreover, even from the point of view of responsibility (the main point is of course not to investigate responsibility), I also believe that since Mr. Lao She has already written his self-criticism, then the critics who enthusiastically advised Mr. Lao She to change his creative plan, who believed that writers cannot create typical characters based on reasonable imagination, who believed that a play must raise and solve problems unrelated to the theme, and who believed that the political nature of a work must be proportional to the length of its tail, should also answer his questions: Whose opinion was wrong, and why was it wrong?

    I believe that discussing such widely representative issues will definitely help establish the correct literary criticism that we urgently need.

### 反对不正确的文艺批评

专栏：读者来信

    反对不正确的文艺批评编辑同志：
    我读了文艺报第三十一期老舍先生的“谈方珍珠剧本”一文，受到很大的感动。
    老舍先生的这个剧本，基本上是一个优秀的作品，但是也有显然的缺点。这个缺点是不正确的文艺批评所造成的。
    老舍先生的文章说，他写这个剧本的原来的计划，是全剧共写四幕，前三幕写在旧社会被蹂躏得毫无出路的艺人方珍珠和她周围的一群人，后一幕写她在解放后的狂喜，“教她见到光明，成为典型的人物”。结果因为“友人们嘱告”，改变了计划，在第三幕以后突然提出许多艺人们所遇到的新问题，包括钟惦棐同志所指摘过的到农村去的问题。原定的第四幕勉强拉成了两幕。“于是，前后不一致，至全剧闭幕时，没有一个总的，自然的，有力的效果，使观众失望”。
    老舍先生既然选定了一个正确的主题，又充满了政治的和艺术的热情，又充分熟悉这个戏剧中的人物和环境，又有表现这个“典型环境中的典型性格”的充分戏剧才能，但是结果却没有能够充分地如愿以偿，在作品中留下了作者自己所公正地指出的两个重要缺点。这一切是为什么发生的呢？怎样补救呢？教训在那里呢？这些问题，我们不应当放过。
    上一期的“人民文艺”，重新发表了俄国共产党中央一九二五年关于文艺政策的决议，这对于我们发展正确的文艺批评是有益处的。但是在事实上，仅仅发表无论多少决议，是不会自动地解决任何问题的。我们应当利用这些决议来检查和改善我们自己的工作。这个决议说：
    “对于无产阶级作家，党应当采取这样的立场：以一切方法帮助他们的成长，并用各种办法支持他们和他们的组织，同时还应当用一切手段防止他们中间摆共产党员架子这种最有害的现象的出现。正因为把他们看作苏维埃文学将来的思想领导者，所以党应当以一切方法与那些对旧文化遗产和文艺专门家的轻率和蔑视的态度作斗争。”
    “共产主义批评应当在文学上避免使用命令的语气。这种批评只有以自己思想的优越性为依靠的时候，才能具有深刻的教育意义。马克思主义批评应当从自己中间驱除狂妄的、半通的和神气十足的共产党员架子。马克思主义批评应当给自己提出‘学习’这个口号，并且应当打击自己中间的一切废话和胡说。”
    “党应当用一切办法根除对文学事业的专横的和不胜任的行政干涉的尝试。”这些方针，对于我们今天是多么亲切啊！我们也需要同样的方针。那么，用这个观点来看看“方珍珠”剧本的故事吧。在老舍先生的友人们中间，是不是也有这里所提的摆共产党员架子的人们呢？他们是不是应当由于这个文件的提醒而进行一种检讨呢？我以为，只有出现了这种检讨，才能证明发表这类文件是有反响的，有意义的。
    而且，甚至单从责任上说（主要点当然不在研究责任），我也以为，老舍先生既已写出了他的自我检讨，那么，曾经热心地劝告老舍先生改变创作计划，认为作家不可以根据合理的想象创造典型人物，认为一个剧本必须提出和解决与主题无关的问题，认为一个作品的政治性必须与尾巴的长短成比例的批评者们，也就应当来答复他的问题：究竟是谁的意见错了，和为什么错了。
    我相信，讨论这样的有广泛代表性的问题，一定会帮助建立我们所迫切需要的正确的文艺批评。
