　　A New Upsurge in the Patriotic Production Emulation Campaign
　　——Production Teams Across the Country Respond to the Challenge of the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Team
　　Qiao Yuzhou
　　To ensure that the patriotic production emulation campaign is sustained regularly, the famous Ma Hengchang advanced production team of the Northeast No. 5 Machine Factory put forward five conditions in January to challenge workers in factories and mines across the country. The five conditions guarantee: 1. Unite with technical personnel, strengthen technical learning, improve operating methods, achieve a quality standard of over 90%, and complete tasks ahead of schedule. 2. Masters guarantee to raise all apprentices to 60% of the general technical level; apprentices guarantee to cherish machines, organize tools, and not affect the master's starting the machine on time. 3. Abide by labor discipline, stick to work posts, and ensure that attendance rates do not decrease before and after the Spring Festival. 4. Strengthen the work of four preventions (fire prevention, theft prevention, accident prevention, and sabotage prevention), guarantee the safety of all machines and personnel in the team, cherish public property, and overcome waste. 5. Strengthen current affairs study, raise political awareness, and do a good job of propaganda and mobilization. This challenge from the Ma Hengchang team has quickly received enthusiastic responses from the broad masses of workers across the country. As a result, the patriotic production emulation campaign launched in various parts of the country since last winter has entered a new climax.

　　On January 17, the Workers' Daily, the organ of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, published the news of the Ma Hengchang advanced production team challenging workers across the country. On the same day, the newspaper also published a commentary, calling on workers across the country to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang advanced production team. The next day, some production teams in factories in the capital responded to the challenge one after another under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Subsequently, the national committees or preparatory committees of the Chinese machinery manufacturing, textile, postal and telecommunications, railway, and chemical industry trade unions, as well as the trade unions of Northeast, Central South, Northwest and other provinces and cities, successively issued calls to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang production team. According to statistics from reports received from various places as of the 6th, more than 20 industrial and mining enterprises and more than 600 production teams (workshops, sections, divisions, offices) in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xi'an, and various enterprises and mines, have participated in the response. The representatives attending the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers have actively led the masses to participate in the competition movement. Labor models such as Li Shuhe, Wei Zhenhua, Li Zhaozhen, Zhao Naibin, Sun Lianwang, Ma Wanshui, Liu Jiuxue, Qu Fuming, Jia Dingxun, Zhang Zifu, Wang Yazhou, Liu Fenjiang, Wang Zhaoda, Zhang Fengxiang, Qiu Yeheng, Deng Wenyi, Jin Yusheng, Huang Xirui, and Dai Jinheng, as well as the nationally famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive and the various teams of the "Zhao Guoyou Lathe Section," have successively led the teams and groups in their factories to challenge the Ma Hengchang production team. All the technical personnel of the 13th Factory of the Northeast Mechanical Bureau and the accounting section team of the Tianjin Hengda Flour Mill have also participated in the competition. While responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang advanced production team, some teams have also issued challenges to workers in the same industry or region. The water meter team of the Beijing Waterworks Company, the Fengtai Train Section, the Jin Sheng team of the Beijing Post Office's opening section, the long-distance station of the Zhengzhou Telecommunications Bureau, the steel rolling branch of the Fushun Steel Plant, and the ore smelting workshop of the Shenyang Smelting Plant have all issued challenges to workers in their respective industries across the country. The Wang Yongxiang Ironworking Team of Hunan and the Tian Yupuxiao Team of Songjiang have respectively challenged workers in their respective regions.

　　In order to overcome the shortcomings existing in the previous production emulation campaign, such as imbalance, temporary rushes, and the generalization of competition conditions, employees in various places have begun to propose responses to the challenge based on specific circumstances and with reference to the conditions of the Ma Hengchang production team. On January 26, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions specifically requested in a notice issued to its affiliated trade unions: factories and mines that have not launched or have not launched the competition well in the past should take this opportunity to quickly mobilize all workers to respond to the challenge and pay attention to planning and organization to avoid the bias of temporary rushes; factories and mines that have already launched the competition should deepen and consolidate existing achievements, organize workers to discuss and formulate practical plans to solve key problems in workshop production; organize employees to discuss strengthening the work of four preventions during the Spring Festival, etc. The Northwest Regional Federation of Trade Unions specifically requested its affiliated trade unions at all levels to go deep into workshops and teams, specifically help workers formulate practical and feasible response conditions, and specifically organize workers to learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team in the response, so as to create a large number of Ma Hengchang-style teams in the Northwest region. In the conditions proposed by employees in factories in the Central South region, they generally formulated conditions such as improving quality, reducing waste, and ensuring safe production to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team, based on their shortcomings such as low quality, many defective products, and many accidents.

　　Many employees in various places have excitedly and cautiously participated in this competition. Li Guodong, a worker in the typesetting section of the Jinan Xinhua Printing Factory, said: "The Ma Hengchang team is our elder brother, and we should learn from him and respond to his challenge." The Guo Wencheng team of the Machine Tool Department of the Fourth Factory of the Municipal Industrial Bureau discussed four times when proposing the response, and seriously studied the short commentary "Responding to the Challenge of the Ma Hengchang Team" in the Beijing Workers' Daily. They linked the existing high scrap rate and the problem of disunity within the team with the unity of the Ma Hengchang team to make a review and improve the relationship between workmates and between masters and apprentices within the team. Many other teams have also formulated their own response plans in the same way with reference to the conditions of the Ma Hengchang team.

　　At present, the competition movement launched by the Ma Hengchang team is continuing to be carried out enthusiastically in various places. In order to make this movement more extensive, in-depth, and regularly sustained, some shortcomings existing in the response in some places should be paid attention to and overcome. According to existing materials, these shortcomings are mainly: some factories have proposed common conditions for the entire factory to respond to the challenge, but there are no specific plans for teams or individuals to ensure the realization of these conditions; some teams have too many, too high, or generalized conditions; the response has not been combined with learning the working methods of the Ma Hengchang team, etc. Everyone knows that carrying out the Ma Hengchang team competition movement is a very important matter. Through such a national-scale competition of advanced production teams, not only can the patriotic production competition movement be more in-depth, extensive, and sustained, but it is also a major way to do a good job in the grassroots team and workshop work of the trade union. Therefore, better mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of workers to formulate their own practical and feasible response conditions is an important task for trade union comrades in various places.

　　爱国主义生产竞赛运动的新高涨      
    ——各地生产小组向马恒昌先进生产小组应战
    乔雨舟
    为使爱国主义的生产竞赛经常地坚持下去，著名的东北第五机器厂马恒昌先进生产小组于一月提出了五项条件，向全国各厂矿工人进行挑战。五项条件保证：一、团结技术人员，加强技术学习，改进操作方法，质量达到标准的百分之九十以上，提前完成任务。二、师傅保证把所有的徒工提高到一般技术水平的百分之六十；徒工保证爱护机器，整理工具，不影响师傅到点开车。三、遵守劳动纪律，坚守工作岗位，保证春节前后出勤率不降低。四、加强四防工作，保证全组机器和人员的安全；爱护公物，克服浪费。五、加强时事学习，提高政治觉悟，做好宣传鼓动工作。马恒昌小组的这一挑战，迅速地获得了各地广大工人群众的热烈响应。由此，使去年冬季以来在全国各地开展的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，进入了一个新的高潮。
    一月十七日，中华全国总工会机关报工人日报刊载了马恒昌先进生产小组向全国工人挑战的消息。同日该报并发表评论，号召全国工人向马恒昌先进生产小组应战。第二天，首都各厂部分生产小组就在市总工会领导下纷纷应战。接着，中国机器制造业、纺织、邮电、铁路、化学等产业工会全国委员会或筹备委员会及东北、中南、西北和各地省、市工会，均相继发出了向马恒昌生产小组应战的号召。现在，据截至六日止所收到的各地报道统计，参加应战的已有京、津、沈、汉、穗、西安等各大城市和各地企业矿山的二十余个工矿企业单位和六百余个生产小组（车间、科、股、室）出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表们都积极地带动群众参加了竞赛运动。李书和、魏振华、李兆珍、赵乃斌、孙连旺、马万水、刘九学、曲福明、贾鼎勋、张子富、王亚洲、刘芬江、王兆达、张凤翔、仇业衡、邓文益、金玉声、黄熙瑞、戴金恒等劳动模范及全国著名的“毛泽东号”机车、“赵国有车工部”各小组，均先后带动所在工厂的班、组，先后向马恒昌生产小组应战。东北机械局十三厂全体技术人员和天津恒大面粉厂会计课小组也参加了竞赛。有些小组在向马恒昌先进生产小组应战的同时，并向同一产业或地区的工人提出了挑战。北京自来水公司水表组、丰台列车段、北京邮局开筒班金声小组、郑州电讯局长途台、抚顺制钢厂轧钢分厂、沈阳冶炼厂熔矿股车间等单位的工人，均向全国各该业工人提出了挑战。湖南王永祥铁工班、松江田玉璞小组等则分别向各该地区工人挑战。
    为着克服前此生产竞赛运动中所存在的不平衡、突击一时和竞赛条件的一般化等缺点，各地职工一开始就依据具体情况，参照马恒昌生产小组的条件提出应战。一月二十六日东北总工会在向所属工会发出通知时，具体要求：过去没有很好发动或根本未发动竞赛的工厂矿山，应即趁此着手迅速发动全体工人起来应战，并要注意到计划性与组织性，避免突击一时的偏向；已在开展竞赛的工厂矿山，则应深入巩固已有成绩，组织工人讨论和制订切合实际的计划，来解决车间生产上的关键问题；组织职工讨论在春节期间加强四防工作等。西北区总工会则特别要求所属各级工会干部深入车间和小组，具体帮助工人们制订切实可行的应战条件，并具体组织工人在应战中学习马恒昌小组的先进经验，以大量地创造西北区的马恒昌式小组。中南区各工厂职工所提条件中，一般都根据其质量低、废品多和事故多等缺点，订出提高质量、减少废品和安全生产等条件，向马恒昌小组应战。
    各地许多职工都兴奋地慎重地参加这一次的竞赛。济南新华印刷厂打版股李国栋小组的工友说：“马恒昌小组是咱们的老大哥，咱应当向他学习，向他应战。”该市工业局四厂机工部郭文成小组在提出应战时曾讨论了四次，并认真地学习了北京工人日报“向马恒昌小组应战”的短评。他们根据现有报废率较高及组内不团结问题和马恒昌小组的团结情形联系起来作了检讨，改善了组内工友间、师徒间的关系。其他许多小组也同样地参照马恒昌小组的条件，制订出了自己的应战计划。
    目前，马恒昌小组发动的这个竞赛运动正在各地继续热烈开展。为了把这一运动更广泛、深入并经常地坚持下去，现在某些地方应战中所存在的一些缺点，即应注意克服。根据现有材料，这些缺点主要的是：有些工厂全厂提出了共同条件应战，而没有小组或个人的具体计划来保证这些条件实现；有些小组的条件太多、过高或一般化；没有把应战和学习马恒昌小组工作方法结合起来等。大家知道：开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动，是一件非常重要的事情。通过这样一个全国规模的先进生产小组的竞赛，不仅使爱国主义的生产竞赛运动能更深入、广泛并坚持下去，而且也是搞好工会基层小组和车间工作的主要方式。因此，更好地发动和组织广大工人群众制订出自己实际可行的应战条件，是各地工会工作同志们的一项重要的工作任务。
