　　Supplementary Notice from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Regarding the Commemoration of the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day to Trade Unions at All Levels

　　In order to commemorate our great and militant "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and three other organizations have jointly issued a notice. In addition to carrying out commemorations based on the general spirit and methods of the notice, the following supplementary points are made by the Federation regarding key propaganda points and the rewarding of outstanding female workers, female staff members, and model family members of workers and staff:

　I. The following points should be emphasized in propaganda:

　　(1) Combined with the current situation and the specific facts in local production, conduct patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education among the broad masses of female workers and family members of workers and staff. Expose the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its aggressive war, resolutely oppose US imperialism's rearming of Japan, and oppose US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan. By lodging accusations against the crimes of rape, arson, and murder committed by Japan when it invaded China in the past, arouse the masses to deepen their hatred of US imperialism and its accomplice, the Japanese war criminals. Publicize the unity and victory of the people of China and Korea, the failure of the US aggressive war in Korea, and the contradictions within imperialism. We should have full confidence and determination to continue to destroy any aggressive plans of imperialism. Continue to deeply mobilize female workers and family members of workers and staff to actively participate in the patriotic movement and patriotic production campaigns.

　　(2) Publicize the improved political and economic status of female workers and family members of workers and staff under the people's government led by the Communist Party. The Common Program stipulates: protect the special interests of female workers; protect the health of mothers, infants, and children. The body search system, which insulted the working class, especially female workers, has been abolished. State-owned factories and mines have taken the lead in implementing equal pay for equal work for men and women, gradually improving the lives of female workers, especially the care for mothers and infants. In 286 factory nurseries and kindergartens in 29 industrial cities across the country, more than 11,960 children have received reasonable care. Female workers have begun to move into new technical positions. Some female workers have participated in administrative and production management. At the grassroots level, some family members of workers and staff have served as neighborhood chiefs and group leaders. Trade unions have also organized family members of workers and staff to study culture and politics, participate in social activities, and participate in factory production mobilization meetings, worker representative meetings, and model selection meetings. All of this shows that the working class has become the masters of the country.

　　(3) Publicize the active participation of female workers in the patriotic production campaign to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and the role played by family members of workers and staff in the campaign. Use concrete examples to illustrate the boundless patriotic enthusiasm shown by female workers and family members of workers and staff in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. For example, textile workers overfulfilled the 1950 production task and received national bonuses. The "March 8th" locomotive crew, headed by Tian Guiying, was approved as a "Iron Ox" team and challenged the entire section with 100,000 kilometers of safe driving. Female drivers An Guiye and Zhang Shuxian from the Lushun-Dalian Automobile Company volunteered to go to Korea to undertake transportation work, going to the forefront of the battle. Female workers at the Yuandian Metal Machinery Factory created unprecedented records in production. Female telephone operators from the Andong Railway Bureau and Telegraph Bureau persisted in their work and completed their tasks under enemy bombing. In the patriotic competition, family members of workers and staff made guarantees that workers would go to work, eat, and rest on time, and guaranteed that they would not hold back, nor listen to rumors. Family members of workers and staff also challenged each other or couples challenged each other, signing contracts, etc., encouraging the workers' enthusiasm for production. For example, after the family members of workers and staff of the Lushun-Dalian Steel Plant issued a challenge, the attendance rate of workers increased from 85 percent to 93 percent.

　　Publicize female workers and family members of workers and staff actively supporting the front lines, writing letters of condolence, making comfort bags, raising donations, organizing volunteer rescue teams, participating in worker pickets, strengthening fire prevention, anti-special agent, anti-theft, and air defense work, as well as the family members of workers and staff completing the cotton padding work for military cotton clothing, encouraging their husbands, sons and daughters to join the Chinese People's Volunteers, military cadre schools, etc.; and promoting the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, solving the practical difficulties of the family members of workers and staff, such as helping women in childbirth, patients, and taking care of children in rotation or by exchanging labor.

　　(4) Publicize female workers learning from the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang team, and many model teams have emerged. For example, the Sun Guilan team in Tianjin, the Yuan Guihua team in Lushun-Dalian, etc. In the future, we must make even greater efforts to learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang team, strengthen unity and mutual assistance, exchange experiences, study business, improve technology, carefully plan, pay attention to the lives and health of workers and staff, create more Ma Hengchang-style female worker teams, and transform the patriotic production campaign into a daily working and living style for the broad masses of female workers.

　II. Award Outstanding Female Workers and Select Model Family Members of Workers and Staff (Combined with local specific conditions, awards can be given by basic-level trade unions, industrial systems, or cities).

　　(1) Significance of the Award:

　　Through the method of awards, activists can be discovered, production enthusiasm can be encouraged, and existing achievements can be consolidated; the model actions of female workers and family members of workers and staff themselves can be used to educate and improve the masses, with the advanced leading the backward. Actively improve the technical, political, and cultural levels of female workers and family members of workers and staff in order to play a greater role in the patriotic production campaign, and further improve the work of female workers and family members of workers and staff.

　　Starting from the existing level, cultivate outstanding female workers and model family members of workers and staff; from attaching importance to their achievements, gradually cultivate them into comprehensive labor models, and prepare to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day and strive to attend this year's Labor Model Representative Conference.

　　(2) Methods:

　　A. According to the magnitude of the achievements, give collectives and individuals spiritual or material rewards. Rewards should be combined with education in collectivism.

　　B. Rewards should be appropriate, and commendations should be widespread. Discover and cultivate talents in many ways, and establish good role models in all aspects. Full preparations should be made in advance to make the masses understand the significance of rewarding outstanding female workers and model family members of workers and staff; and the opinions of the masses should be heard in the selection process.

　　C. Attention should be paid to collectivity and persistence to avoid doing a separate set of things, or becoming a temporary crash job. Various methods should be used to consolidate and develop existing achievements, and expand and deepen the patriotic production campaign.

　　D. Due to the uneven development of the work of family members of workers and staff and the different specific work carried out in various places, it is impossible to have a unified standard for evaluating model family members of workers and staff. Whatever work has been carried out, evaluate model family members for that work. However, the focus should be on evaluating models for patriotic support for the front, doing a good job in household affairs, and assisting workers and staff in completing production tasks. In addition, models can be produced in learning, unity, and mutual assistance. In areas with a weak work foundation, active family members of workers and staff can be commended without conducting model evaluations.

　　E. This work should be carried out by the local female workers' departments in coordination with the trade unions to formulate specific implementation plans. The trade union will be responsible for implementation, and administrative support and the assistance of the Democratic Women's Federation should be obtained. The issue of funding will be resolved through consultations with relevant parties based on the specific situation.

　　Finally, on March 8, the cultural palaces and clubs in major cities can be opened to female workers and female staff for one day, and some pictures and materials on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and on maternal and child health can be prepared for display and exhibition at that time.

　　中华全国总工会关于纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节给各级工会的补充通知
    为纪念我们伟大的战斗的“三八”国际劳动妇女节，中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国总工会等五团体，已发出联合通知。各地工会除根据该通知的总的精神、办法进行纪念外，关于宣传要点及奖励优秀女工、女职员、职工家属模范等事项，本会特作如下补充：
　一、应着重下列各点进行宣传
    （一）结合目前形势及各地生产中的具体事实，在广大女工及职工家属群众中进行爱国主义与国际主义的宣传教育。揭露美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和。把过去日本侵略中国时奸淫烧杀的罪行，以控诉方式，引起群众加深对美帝国主义和他的帮凶日本战争罪犯的仇恨。宣传中朝两国人民的团结和胜利，美国在朝鲜侵略战争的失败及帝国主义内部的矛盾，我们应当完全有信心和决心来继续摧毁帝国主义的任何侵略计划。继续深入动员女工及职工家属群众，积极地参加爱国运动和爱国主义生产竞赛。
    （二）宣传在共产党所领导的人民政权下，女工和职工家属的政治经济地位已提高。共同纲领规定：保护女工的特殊利益；保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。侮辱工人阶级特别是女工群众的搜身制度已经废除了。国营厂矿首先实行了男女同工同酬，逐步地改善了女工的生活，特别是对于母亲和婴儿的照顾。在全国二十九个工业城市的二百八十六处工厂托儿所及幼稚园中，有一万一千九百六十多个孩子得到了合理的照顾。女工开始走向新的技术岗位。部分女工参加了行政和生产管理工作。在基层政权中，部分职工家属担任了闾长、组长。工会并组织职工家属学习文化、政治、参加社会活动，参加工厂的生产动员大会、职工代表会、评选模范大会等。这一切都说明工人阶级作了国家的主人。
    （三）宣传女工积极参加抗美援朝的爱国主义生产竞赛，和职工家属在竞赛中所起的作用。用具体例子说明各地女工和职工家属在抗美援朝运动中表现了无限的爱国热情。例如纺织工人超额完成了一九五○年的生产任务，得到国家奖金。以田桂英为首的“三八”号机车乘务员被批准为铁牛队员，并以安全行车十万公里向全段挑战。旅大汽车公司女司机安桂叶、张淑贤志愿赴朝，担任运输工作，走向战斗的最前线。远电金属机械厂女工在生产中创造了空前纪录。安东铁路局和报话局的女电话员在敌机轰炸下，坚持工作，完成任务。在爱国主义竞赛中，职工家属提出保证职工按时上班、吃饭、休息；并保证不扯腿，不听信谣言。职工家属间并互相挑战或夫妇互相挑战、订合同等，鼓励了职工生产情绪。如旅大钢铁厂职工家属提出挑战后，工友出勤率由百分之八十五提高到百分之九十三。
    宣传女工和职工家属积极支援前线，写慰问信，制慰问袋，募捐，组织志愿救护队，参加工人纠察队，加强防火、防特、特盗、防空工作以及职工家属完成军棉衣的絮行工作，鼓励丈夫，儿女参加中国人民志愿军、军事干部学校等；并发扬友爱互助精神，解决职工家属中的切身困难，如帮助产妇、病人，轮流、变工带孩子等。
    （四）宣传女工学习马恒昌小组的先进生产经验，出现了很多模范小组。例如天津的孙桂兰小组、旅大的袁桂花小组等。今后更要加一把力，学习马恒昌小组的经验，加强团结互助、交流经验、钻研业务、提高技术、精心计划、注意职工生活健康，创造更多的马恒昌式的女工小组，把爱国主义生产竞赛，变成广大女工群众日常的劳动方式和生活方式。
　二、奖励优秀女工及评选模范职工家属（结合各地具体情况，可
        按基层工会、产业系统或市为单位进行奖励）。
    （一）奖励的意义：
    通过奖励这一办法可以发现积极分子，鼓励生产热情，巩固已有成绩；以女工及职工家属群众自己的模范行动来教育、提高群众，由先进的带动落后的。积极提高女工和职工家属的技术、政治、文化水平，以便在爱国主义生产竞赛中发挥更大的作用，并把女工和职工家属工作更提高一步。
    从现有水平出发，培养优秀女工、模范职工家属；从重视其一点成就，逐渐培养成为全面的劳动模范，并准备迎接“五一”劳动节，争取出席今年的劳动模范代表会议。
    （二）办法：
    甲、根据成绩的大小，给集体和个人以精神的或物质的奖励，奖励时要结合集体主义的教育。
    乙、奖励要适当，表扬要广泛。多方面发现与培养人才，树立各方面的好榜样。事先应有充分准备，使群众了解奖励优秀女工、模范职工家属的意义；并应在选择过程中多听取群众的意见。
    丙、应注意集体性和持久性，避免单独的搞一套，或成为临时的突击工作。要以各种方法巩固和发展已有成绩，扩大深入爱国主义生产竞赛。
    丁、由于职工家属工作发展的不平衡，各地进行的具体工作又不一样，因此，评选职工家属模范不可能有统一的标准，已开展什么工作，就评选什么模范。但应以评选爱国支前、搞好家务、协助职工完成生产任务的模范为主。此外，在学习、团结互助等工作中，都可产生模范。工作基础薄弱地区，可表扬积极的职工家属，不进行评选模范。
    戊、此项工作应由各地女工部协同工会制订具体进行计划。由工会主持执行，并要取得行政支持和民主妇女联合会的协助。经费问题看具体情况，与有关方面协商解决。
    最后，三月八日，各大城市的文化宫、俱乐部可为女工、女职员开放一天，并准备一些抗美援朝和妇婴卫生的图片、资料等，届时陈列展览。
