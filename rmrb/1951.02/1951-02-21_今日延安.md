　　Today's Yan'an
  (I)
    Yan'an – the cradle of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, was originally a mountain city described as "mountains embracing Yan city, the city leaning against the mountains, with the Yan River winding along the city's edge." The streets within the city were wide and straight, and the houses were orderly. Outside the city, the tall pagoda on Pagoda Hill overlooked the entire city. In 1938, due to the frantic bombing by Japanese invaders, the houses in the city were reduced to rubble. The unyielding people of Yan'an rebuilt a new market in the south gate of Yan'an and in the ravines. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of Yan'an launched a large-scale production campaign, turning barren mountains into fertile fields, and people lived a life of abundance.
    In March 1947, the Hu Zongnan bandits occupied Yan'an, and the entire county suffered severe damage. Seventeen and a half townships (out of a total of fifty-one townships in the county at the time) became "no-man's-lands." The people of Yan'an were heroic; they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army and, after a year and a month of fighting, defeated the numerically superior Hu Zongnan bandits. However, when they returned home, they found desolation everywhere. The villages visited by the enemy were left without even a chicken. Twenty-six percent of the population was starving, and diseases were widespread. At this time, Chairman Mao sent a telegram instructing that Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, from 1936 to 1948, had been the location of the CPC Central Committee and the general rear area of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. The people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had made great contributions to the people of the whole country. He hoped that the people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region would continue to unite as one, quickly restore the wounds of war, and develop economic and cultural construction.
    The cadres and people of Yan'an felt infinite glory and excitement at Chairman Mao's concerned instructions. They reprinted it, posted it on the walls, studied it, and took it as a guide for action.
  (II)
    After Yan'an was liberated, the county people's government immediately established the Yan'an County Disaster Relief Committee, and each village also established disaster relief teams, calling on the people to help each other and carry out production. The people's government also allocated grain for disaster relief, ensuring that no one starved to death.
    In order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions, the Yan'an County Committee of the CPC and the Yan'an County People's Government put forward the slogan "Production is the overriding central task" to the 86,000 people of the county. The brave, hardworking, and highly politically conscious people of Yan'an enthusiastically responded to this call. When cave dwellings lacked doors and windows, they used Artemisia and sorghum stalks to weave coverings to resist the cold wind; when there was no grain, they ate bran and wild vegetables; when there were no hoes or plows, they collected broken pots and iron scraps destroyed by the Hu bandits to forge and manufacture them; when manpower and animal power were insufficient, they organized labor exchange, with young people taking the lead and women also going to the fields. In this way, the people of Yan'an spent the first year after the war (1948), restoring 80% of the original cultivated land area. The famous labor hero Yang Buhao recalled this period of arduous struggle, saying: "At that time, we eliminated a bunch of enemies. When we returned to the village, the common people couldn't even eat black bean stalks or corn stalks, and the Hu bandits had taken all the bedding! We had to eat bran and wild vegetables and still produce, and we made it through!"
    In 1949 and 1950, cadres at all levels in Yan'an again went all out to lead the masses in quickly restoring production. They not only led the masses in production but also personally assisted farmers in hoeing and carrying manure. In addition, each person had to hand in 80 or 90 catties (old scale) of grain as a production task in order to reduce the burden on the masses. During the summer hoeing last year, 75.6% of the male labor force and 39% of the female labor force in the county participated in labor exchange. The income from women's weaving (last year, 6,300 women participated in weaving, producing more than 39,400 zhang of cloth) and the sale of mountain products solved last year's spring famine.
  (III)
    After three years of hard work, Yan'an has basically recovered from the wounds of war. Except for livestock, the cultivated land area has been restored to the level of 1947, and people's lives have greatly improved. In Yang Buhao Township, which recovered quickly, each person was able to sew a new set of clothes and eat a meal of wheat food every two days last year.
    After the autumn harvest last year, Yan'an saw "three more" things: more people building houses and kilns and replacing old doors and windows; more people buying printed cloth; and more people getting married. Many villages are renovating houses. For example, in Shen Changlin Township, the famous labor hero, more than ten houses were built and forty earth-brick-stone kilns were renovated, and more than one hundred families replaced their doors and windows. Nearly a hundred tile-roofed houses have been built on the ruins of the old city of Yan'an, and three inns and one factory have begun operations. The machines of the Yufeng Cotton Textile Factory are humming in the old city. The Yan'an Veterinary Station has also begun construction, and three hundred merchants have applied for registration and are preparing to build houses.
    Many shops in the new market in the south gate of Yan'an are renovating their fronts and expanding their business. Last September, the number of merchants in the city increased from 399 to 779 (excluding peddlers and small merchants). Some merchants, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds, adopted joint operations, such as the Xinhua Department Store and the Huashenghe United Store, and their business is thriving.
  (IV)
    The people of Yan'an are very concerned about major events at home and abroad. In addition to relying on winter schools, cultural centers, and blackboards, they mainly rely on literacy groups and reading groups to understand the current situation. There are now twelve literacy groups and twenty-two reading groups in the county. Women in Yan'an City, Panlong, and other places who participated in literacy groups have learned to recognize five hundred characters after a year of study and can keep accounts and write notes. Young people in the Nian Zhuang reading group, who were originally illiterate, can now recognize more than eighty characters. They wrote a letter to the "Yan'an Daily" saying: "Our reading group is all young people. We learned from the newspaper that American imperialist planes bombed the Korean people and flew over our Northeast airspace, strafing and bombing the Chinese people, and invading our Taiwan. We wish we could take one step to Korea, 'the old Wang beats the dog, all at once', to help the Korean people clean up the bad seed of American imperialism."
    Many farmers, after hearing the news from the newspapers through the reading groups, expressed their desire to actively pay grain, strengthen militia training, and complete and exceed production plans in order to resist the United States and aid Korea with practical actions. They not only hate American imperialism but also despise it. This can be seen from a quick-rhyme poem on the blackboard.
    The poem reads: "Chicken legs, paper waist, American imperialism is like a skinny wolf. It wants to bite but has no strength, it will surely be wiped out." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　今日延安
  （一）
    延安——中国人民解放斗争的摇篮，原来是座“山抱延城城依山，城边延水逐山湾”的山城。城内街道宽直，房屋整齐。城外宝塔山上的高塔，俯视全城。一九三八年由于日寇的疯狂轰炸，城内房屋尽成瓦砾。不屈的延安人民就在延安南关和山沟里另建了新的市场。在毛主席领导下，延安人民开展了大生产运动，使贫瘠的山地变成了肥沃的良田，人们都过着丰衣足食的日子。
    一九四七年三月，胡宗南匪徒侵占了延安，全县遭受了严重的破坏，有十七个半乡（当时全县共五十一乡）成为“无人区”。延安人民是英勇的，他们配合人民解放军，经一年零一个月的战斗，打败了优势的胡宗南匪徒。但是，当他们回到家里的时候，满目荒凉。敌人到过的村庄，连一只鸡也没留下，百分之二十六的人陷于饥饿之中，疾病广泛地流行着。这时，毛主席来了电报指示说：延安和陕甘宁边区，从一九三六年到一九四八年曾经是中共中央所在地，曾经是中国人民解放斗争的总后方，延安和陕甘宁边区的人民，对全国人民是有伟大贡献的。我希望延安和陕甘宁边区的人民继续团结一致，迅速恢复战争的创伤，发展经济建设和文化建设。
    延安的干部和人民，对毛主席这一关切的指示，感到无限的光荣和兴奋。他们把它翻印出来，贴在墙上，进行学习，把它当作行动的指针。
  （二）
    延安光复后，县人民政府立即成立了延安县救灾委员会，各村也成立了救灾小组，号召人民互助互济，开展生产。人民政府又拨粮救灾，保证了没饿死一个人。
    为了执行毛主席的指示，中共延安县委员会和延安县人民政府向全县八万六千人提出“生产为压倒一切的中心工作”的口号。勇敢而勤劳的有高度政治觉悟的延安人民，热烈响应了这个号召。窰洞没有门窗，就用黄蒿和高粱杆编织起来抵御寒风；没有粮食，就吃糠菜；没有鐝头犁铧，就收集被胡匪破坏的烂锅铁片来烧打制造；人力畜力不够，就组织变工，年青的带头，妇女也下地。就这样，延安人民度过战后第一年（一九四八年），恢复了原有耕地面积的百分之八十。著名劳动英雄杨步浩回忆这一段艰苦斗争情形说：“那时候我们把敌人消灭了一个利洒。回到庄上，老百姓连黑豆槎槎、玉米槎槎也吃不上，铺盖也叫胡儿子拾掇光啦！我们吃糠格蛋还要生产，撑过来啦！”
    一九四九年和一九五○年，延安各级干部又以全力领导人民群众迅速恢复生产。他们不仅领导群众生产，亲自协助农民锄地，担大粪，而且每人还要交八、九十斤（老秤）粮食的生产任务，以减轻群众的负担。去年夏锄中，全县百分之七十五点六的男劳动力和百分之三十九的女劳动力参加了变工。妇女纺织（去年有六千三百妇女参加纺织，共织布三万九千四百多丈）和山货外销所得，解决了去年的春荒。
  （三）
    经过三年的努力，延安基本上恢复了战争的创伤。除牲畜外，耕地面积已恢复到一九四七年的水平，人民生活已大大好转。恢复得快的杨步浩乡，去年平均每人能缝一套新衣，两天能吃一顿面食了。
    去年秋收以后，延安出现了“三多”：盖房打窰换新门窗的多；购买花布的多；结婚的多。许多村庄都在整修房屋，如著名劳动英雄申长林乡去年盖房十余间，修盖土砖石窰四十孔，一百多家换了新门窗。延安旧城的废墟上已盖了近百间瓦房，有三家客栈和一家工厂开始营业。裕丰棉织厂的机器在旧城里响起来了。延安兽医站也开始动工修房，三百户商民已申请登记，正准备建筑房屋。
    延安南关新市场的许多商店，正大修门面，扩充营业。去年九月全市商户由三百九十九家增到七百七十九家（摊贩、小商在外）。部分商户为克服资金不足的困难，采用合股经营，如新华百货商店，华盛和联合商店等，营业情况都日益兴旺。
  （四）
    延安人民非常关心国内外的大事。他们除了依靠冬学、文化馆、黑板报外，主要依靠识字组和读报组了解时局。现在全县有十二个识字组和二十二个读报组。延安市、蟠龙等地参加识字组的妇女，经过一年的学习有的已认识五百个字，能够记账开便条了。埝庄青年读报组中原来是文盲的，现在也能认八十多字了。他们给《延安报》写了一封信说：“我们读报组都是年青人，从报纸上知道了美帝国主义飞机轰炸朝鲜人民，又飞到咱东北上空，扫射和轰炸中国人民，侵略咱们的台湾。我们恨不得一步跨到朝鲜，来个“老王打狗、一齐下手”，帮助朝鲜人民拾掇美帝国主义那坏种。”
    许多农民经过读报组听到报纸的消息后，都表示要踊跃纳粮、加强民兵训练，完成并超过生产计划，以实际行动抗美援朝。他们不仅仇视美帝国主义，而且蔑视美帝国主义。这从黑板报上的一首快板诗便可以看出来。
    这首诗写道：“麻杆腿，纸糊的腰，美帝活像一只瘦干了的狼。它想咬人没力量，一定被人消灭光。”（新华社）
