Our Great Motherland
    Mount Tai, the eastern peak of China's famous Five Great Mountains, is located in Tai'an County, Shandong Province, and rises 1,545 meters above sea level, with a circumference of 160 miles. This is a scenic view of Duisong Hill, one of the mountain's famous attractions. This pine tree is called "Independent Official Pine," also known as "Recluse Pine." Legend has it that it has been growing for more than 2,000 years. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang toured Mount Tai, he named it "Official Pine."
