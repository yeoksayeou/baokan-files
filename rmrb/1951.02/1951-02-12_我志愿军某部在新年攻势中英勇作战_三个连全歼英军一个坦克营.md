　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 11th: Frontline reporters report: In the New Year offensive, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army created a brilliant victory of defeating the many with the few, completely annihilating a British mercenary army's heavy tank battalion. Three companies of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, using only explosive packs, hand grenades, demolition tubes, and other light weapons, quickly and completely annihilated the Royal Heavy Tank Battalion of the British 29th Brigade. A total of more than 300 British soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, and 31 tanks equipped with 105mm howitzers, 1 armored vehicle, and 24 tractor trucks were seized and destroyed.

　　On January 2nd, as the American invading army fled south in a panic from Seoul, they ordered the Royal Heavy Tank Battalion of the 29th Brigade and other British troops to remain in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul, to cover their retreat. On January 2nd and 3rd, the Volunteer Army crushed the British army's desperate counterattacks, occupied important strongholds around Uijeongbu, and surrounded the Royal Heavy Tank Battalion. On the evening of the 3rd, three companies of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army launched a fierce attack on the battalion. The Fifth Company alone seized and destroyed 12 tanks and 1 armored vehicle in one night.

　　At 10:00 PM on the 3rd, the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army occupied Bureomidae on the Uijeongbu-Seoul highway, and immediately deployed a 150-meter-wide frontal position along the highway. At 10:20 PM, a British armored vehicle drove in from the north. The Volunteer Army, lying in wait, fired fiercely from the side with machine gun fire. The armored vehicle swerved sharply, darted off the highway, and crashed into a haystack beside the road, becoming trapped and quickly destroyed. The Volunteer Army soldiers suppressed the enemy infantry behind the vehicle with machine gun fire and immediately launched a charge, while shouting in English. The enemies raised their hands in surrender.

　　Five minutes later, three enemy tanks slowly approached, spewing fire. Soldier Liu Fengchun first climbed forward and stuffed an explosive pack into the tracks of the first tank, but it did not explode. Yang Houzhao followed up, but also failed. Machine gun squad leader Li Guanglu quickly put down his machine gun, picked up two demolition tubes, and rushed up to destroy the tracks of the third tank. The tank shook and stopped moving. Then, the other two tanks were blown up by other soldiers one after another. In this first battle, the Volunteer Army suffered no casualties.

　　Five minutes later, three more tanks arrived. Deputy Platoon Leader Chen Wangui climbed onto the first tank with four hand grenades. He found a small hole 20 centimeters wide in the top cover and threw two hand grenades into it, destroying the tank. Next, Li Guanglu successfully destroyed the second tank. Soldier Peng Deyu, carrying a demolition tube, went to blow up the third tank, but was shot and wounded by an enemy who crawled out of the tank turret. Peng Deyu gritted his teeth and cursed: "Let's fight to the death!" Wounded, he followed the tank for more than ten meters and, with all his strength, stuffed the demolition tube between the tracks. With a loud bang, the tank was destroyed. Peng Deyu returned victoriously to his position.

　　The enemy's third batch of three tanks charged again. The enemies sat outside the tanks, concentrating all kinds of firepower to strafe the Volunteer Army. The Volunteer Army first used machine guns to eliminate the enemies outside the tanks. Then, the grenadiers jumped onto the tanks, tapped the turrets with hand grenades, and ordered the enemies to surrender. Seeing that their struggle was ineffective, the enemies in the tanks had no choice but to stick their heads out of the turrets. All three tanks surrendered. It took great effort for the Volunteer Army soldiers to drag these British soldiers out of the tanks.

　　Although the enemy's last three tanks attempted to struggle, they could not escape their doom. The battle of Bureomidae ended victoriously.

　　The enemies of the battalion who fled in other directions were also annihilated by the Volunteer Army. The British Royal Heavy Tank Battalion, as an accomplice to American imperialism's aggression against Korea, met a shameful end under the iron fists of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　我志愿军某部在新年攻势中英勇作战        
    三个连全歼英军一个坦克营
    【新华社朝鲜前线十一日电】前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军在新年攻势中，曾创造了以少胜多、全歼英国帮凶军一个重坦克营的光辉战绩。志愿军某部的三个连，仅用炸药包、手榴弹、爆破筒及其他轻武器，就迅速地全部歼灭了英军第二十九旅的重坦克营。总计毙、伤、俘英军三百多人，缴获和击毁装有一○五公厘榴弹炮的坦克三十一辆，装甲车一辆，牵引汽车二十四辆。
    一月二日，美国侵略军由汉城狼狈南逃，却命令第二十九旅的皇家重坦克营及其他英军部队留在汉城北面的议政府掩护他们撤退。一月二、三两日，志愿军击溃英军的拚死反扑，占领了议政府周围的重要据点，将皇家重坦克营予以包围。三日晚上，志愿军某部的三个连对该营发起猛攻。其中的第五连在一晚之间，就缴获和击毁了坦克十二辆、装甲车一辆。
    三日晚十点钟，志愿军某部第五连占领了由议政府通汉城公路上的佛弥地，随即沿公路布置了一条一百五十公尺的宽正面的阵地。十点二十分，从北面开来一辆英军的装甲车。严阵以待的志愿军用机枪火力从侧面猛烈射击，装甲车猛一掉头，窜下了公路，闯进路旁的一个稻草堆里，进退不得，随即被击毁了。志愿军战士们用机枪压制住了车后面的敌人步兵，随即发起冲锋，同时用英语喊话。敌人纷纷举手投降。
    五分钟以后，敌人的三辆坦克喷吐着炮火缓缓开来。战士刘凤椿首先爬上前去，把炸药包塞到第一辆坦克的履带中，但是没有炸响。杨厚昭接着上去，也没有成功。机枪副班长李广录连忙放下机枪，抱起两个爆破筒赶上去炸毁了第三辆坦克的履带，坦克抖了一下就不动弹了。接着另外两辆坦克也被其他战士先后炸毁。在这第一场战斗中，志愿军无一伤亡。
    五分钟之后，又来了三辆坦克。副排长陈万贵带着四颗手榴弹爬上第一辆坦克，摸到顶盖上有个二十公分宽的小孔，他就从孔里塞进去两个手榴弹，把坦克炸毁了。接着，李广录顺利地炸毁了第二辆坦克。战士彭德玉抱着一个爆破筒去炸第三辆坦克，被从坦克炮塔里钻出来的一个敌人用枪打伤了。彭德玉咬咬牙骂道：“拚一个你死我活吧！”他带着伤跟着坦克追了十多公尺远，用尽全身力气，把爆破筒塞到履带中间去；一声巨响，坦克炸毁了。彭德玉胜利地回到了自己阵地上。
    敌人第三批三辆坦克又冲上来了。敌人坐在坦克外面，集中各种火器向志愿军扫射。志愿军首先用机枪消灭了坦克外面的敌人，接着，掷弹手们跳上坦克，用手榴弹敲打炮塔，命令敌人投降。坦克里的敌人眼看挣扎无效，只好从炮塔里钻出头来，三辆坦克全部投降。志愿军战士们费了很大力气，才把这些英国兵从坦克里拖了出来。
    敌人最后的三辆坦克虽然妄图挣扎，但是都没逃脱毁灭的命运。佛弥地的战斗就这样胜利地结束了。
    由其他方向逃窜的该营敌人，也同样地被志愿军歼灭了。作为美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的帮凶的英国皇家重坦克营，就这样在英勇的中国人民志愿军的铁拳下面，遭到了可耻的灭亡。
