　　Introduction to O. B. Lepeshinskaya
　　Wang Fan
　　Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya, Stalin Prize winner and Doctor of Biological Sciences, who has made great contributions to biology, is now eighty years old. She began her scientific work after the age of fifty; before that, she was a revolutionary.
　　She was born in 1871 in Palmi (now Molotov City) into a wealthy family. Her original surname was Protopopova. As a child, she was an active girl who preferred playing with the children of servants rather than enjoying the glittering family environment. When she was a teenager, she expressed dissatisfaction with the inequality between masters and servants in the family. Especially when she visited a coal mine owned by her mother at the age of sixteen, the inhuman lives of the workers left a very deep impression on her. At that time, she resolved to study medicine so that she could treat the poor without pay in the future.
　　After graduating from middle school, she went to St. Petersburg to study medicine. At that time, St. Petersburg was a center of revolution. She quickly joined the activities of revolutionary young students. She joined a Marxist group, studied revolutionary theory, and listened to Lenin's speeches, which greatly improved her understanding. She began to understand that simply treating the poor was not enough; it was necessary to overthrow the system of human oppression and exploitation. Because she was enthusiastically engaged in revolutionary activities, she broke with her family and severed ties with them. She began to live a very poor life, studying on the one hand and making a living on the other.
　　In December 1895, she received her first revolutionary task: to contact a Mr. Lepeshinsky who had been arrested. According to the laws of Tsarist Russia, arrestees had the right to meet with their mothers, sisters, and fiancées. She impersonated Lepeshinsky's fiancée. This contact was very important for the revolutionary organization, because Lepeshinsky was arrested with Lenin at that time. During the meeting, he asked her to take out the things Lenin wrote in prison. She loved Lepeshinsky, and love grew between them because of their revolutionary work. They later married and changed their surname to Lepeshinskaya.
　　After that, Lepeshinsky was sentenced to exile in Siberia, and she followed him there. There, she took care of Lepeshinsky and other exiles. They wandered in Siberia, and later met Lenin in exile and lived with him. In 1900, after the expiration of the exile period, Lenin, Lepeshinsky and his wife, and others left Siberia. According to Lenin's plan, the Lepeshinsky couple should live in Pskov, but Lepeshinskaya was eager to obtain higher medical education, so she went to Switzerland and entered university. In this place, she met Plekhanov, and she actively threw herself into political activities. On the one hand, she struggled with serious material poverty, which caused her previous tuberculosis to recur. Her husband went to Switzerland to take her back to Pskov.
　　Then, her husband Lepeshinsky was arrested again and exiled to Siberia again, and she followed him to Siberia again. This time, under the strict surveillance of the Tsarist police, she helped Lepeshinsky escape from his exile. Subsequently, she herself also fled Siberia and met her husband in St. Petersburg, and went to Geneva together. Here, she was entrusted to take care of the expelled Bolsheviks. She organized a cafeteria with more than 100 people eating, and she only used one dishwasher. On the other hand, she was still studying at the university.
　　In 1905, due to amnesty, the exiled people returned to Russia. The Lepeshinsky couple also returned to China. Lepeshinskaya entered the Moscow Medical College. She had excellent academic performance. After graduating from medical school in 1915, she served as a doctor at a station near Moscow and began to carry out propaganda work among railway workers.
　　After the October Revolution, Lepeshinskaya devoted all her energy to the construction of the Soviet state. She worked in the People's Education Committee, and she repeatedly completed the most important tasks of the party. She organized the first tuberculosis sanatorium in the Soviet Union and actively participated in the preparation of the University and Medical College in Tashkent.
　　It was not until 1921 that she had the opportunity to approach scientific research. At this time, she was an assistant lecturer in the histology department of Moscow University. However, even here, she still used almost all her strength to carry out political and ideological struggles. Because at that time there was a group of reactionary professors in Moscow University who were hostile to her. In 1926, she transferred to the Timiryazev Institute of Biology, organized a histology laboratory, and began independent research work. Now she leads the Cytology Laboratory of the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences.
　　Although Lepeshinskaya is already eighty years old, she is still very energetic. The hard and intense activities in the past, the poor life, and the three times she suffered from tuberculosis in her life, have not been able to destroy this outstanding person. Even in 1934, when she was 63 years old, she participated in the "Labor Defense of the Motherland" sports test, and she passed everything, swimming 50 meters with a grenade in her hand. Now, she is still very active, often gives reports, and engages in huge scientific research work.

　　奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的介绍
　　王繁
    在生物学上作出伟大贡献的，斯大林奖金获奖人，生物科学博士奥尔迦·保利索夫娜·勒柏辛斯卡娅（ольга　Борисовна
　лепешинская）今年已经八十岁了。她从事于科学工作是在五十岁以后，在此以前，她是一个革命者。
    她于一八七一年生于帕尔米（今莫洛托夫城）的一个富有的家庭中。原姓普洛托波波娃。她在小的时候，是一个喜好活动的女孩子，她宁肯和仆人的孩子们在一块玩而不喜欢浮华的家庭环境。当她少年的时候，就对家庭中主人与仆人间的不平等表示不满，特别是在她十六岁时，她参观了她母亲所有的一处煤矿，那里工人们的非人生活，给她非常深的印象，那时她立志要学医，以便将来不取报酬地为穷人治病。
    在中学毕业后，她到了彼得堡学医。那时彼得堡是一个革命的中心。她很快就参加了革命的青年学生们的活动。她加入了马克思主义小组，学习了革命的理论，听了列宁的讲话，因而在认识上有了很大的进步。她开始明白单给穷人治病是非常不够的，必须推翻这种人压迫人，人剥削人的制度。由于她热烈地从事革命活动，她就和家庭闹翻了，和家庭断绝了关系，她开始过极为穷苦的生活，一方面读书，一方面又要谋生。
    一八九五年十二月，她接到了头一个革命的任务去和被捕的一位勒柏辛斯基联系。依照帝俄的法律，被捕者是有权同母亲、姐妹和未婚妻见面的，她就冒充了勒柏辛斯基的未婚妻。这一条联系对于革命组织是非常重要的，因为那时勒柏辛斯基是和列宁一道被捕的，他在会面时，就把列宁在狱中所写的东西，托她带出来。她爱勒柏辛斯基，两人由革命工作而生爱情，以后就结婚，并改姓勒柏辛斯卡娅。
    之后，勒柏辛斯基被判决流放到西伯利亚，她亦随之前往。在那儿，她照顾着勒柏辛斯基和其他的流刑犯人。他们在西伯利亚流徙着，后来又遇到了流放中的列宁，就和列宁住在一起。一九○○年流放期满，列宁和勒柏辛斯基夫妇及其他的人离开了西伯利亚。按照列宁的计划，勒柏辛斯基夫妇应当住到普斯科夫，但是勒柏辛斯卡娅急欲求得高等医学教育，她就到了瑞士入了大学。在这个地方，她遇到了普列汉诺夫，她又积极地投身于政治活动，一方面又和严重的物质上的穷困作斗争，以致她原患过的肺痨病复发。她丈夫到瑞士去把她接回到普斯科夫。
    接着，他的丈夫勒柏辛斯基又一次被捕，又一次流放到西伯利亚，她又随着到了西伯利亚。这一次，在沙皇宪警的严密监视下，她帮助勒柏辛斯基从流刑地逃走。随后，她自己也逃离了西伯利亚，并在彼得堡和自己丈夫相遇，一起到了日内瓦。在这儿，她受托照顾那些被逐的布尔什维克。她组织起一个食堂，有一百多人吃饭，她只用了一个洗食具的女工，另一方面，她还读着大学。
    一九○五年，由于赦免的关系，被放逐的人们就都回到了俄国。勒柏辛斯基夫妇也回国了。勒柏辛斯卡娅入了莫斯科医学院。她学习成绩极好。一九一五年在医学院毕业，她充当了莫斯科近郊车站的医生，并开始在铁路工人中间进行宣传鼓动工作。
    十月革命以后，勒柏辛斯卡娅尽自己全副精力于苏维埃国家建设。她在人民教育委员部工作，她屡屡完成党的最重大的任务，她曾组织了全苏第一所肺痨施疗所，曾积极参加了塔什干的大学和医学院的筹设工作。
    到一九二一年，她方才有机会接近于科学研究。这时，她是莫斯科大学组织学讲座的助讲。然而，就在这里，她还是几乎用全力进行政治的和思想的斗争。因为那时莫斯科大学里有着一批反动的教授，敌视她。一九二六年，她转到季米里亚采夫生物学院，组织了一个组织学实验室，开始进行独立的研究工作。现在她领导着苏联医药科学院实验生物学研究院的细胞学实验室。
    勒柏辛斯卡娅虽然已经八十岁了，但她精力仍然极健旺。以往艰苦的紧张的活动，穷困的生活，以及她一生中三次生肺痨病，都没有能摧垮这个卓越的人。甚而在一九三四年她已六十三岁的时候，她参加“劳动卫国制”体育测验，还样样及格，她手中拿着手榴弹游泳五十米。现在，她仍然是极爱活动，时常作报告，并从事巨大的科学研究工作。
