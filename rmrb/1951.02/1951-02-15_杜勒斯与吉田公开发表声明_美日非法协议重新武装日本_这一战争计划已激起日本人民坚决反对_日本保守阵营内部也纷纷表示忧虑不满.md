Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: Tokyo News: Dulles, Truman’s “special representative” and a war-monger who arrived in Tokyo on January 25th, has been conducting activities in Japan for more than ten days, plotting the re-armament of Japan. After reaching a tacit agreement with the reactionary Yoshida government, he left Japan on the 11th and flew to Manila to carry out activities there.

Dulles issued a statement the day before he left Japan (the 10th), openly admitting that the US and Japanese reactionaries had already agreed to re-arm Japan and make it an American tool of aggression. In his statement, Dulles said that during his two weeks in Japan, he and the Japanese reactionaries discussed: "1. Principles previously discussed with the Allied countries that may be embodied in the peace treaty. 2. The future security of Japan. 3. The economic problems Japan will encounter after restoring its sovereignty. 4. The development of cultural ties between the American and Japanese people." Dulles also said: "A 'understanding' has been reached on all these issues."

Dulles bluntly stated that the so-called Japanese "security" issue is actually: the continued occupation of Japan by the US military and the re-armament of Japan, and the signing of a "US-Japan military alliance" based on the principles of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, making Japan the main accomplice of the United States in the Far East. Dulles said: The Japanese government "welcomes the United States' willingness to consider sympathetically the suggestion of stationing armed forces in and near Japan." "We have also discussed interim security measures between the United States and Japan, and in this regard, we have pointed out all areas of a specific nature of regional or collective security" by the participating members "continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance."

On the same day, Yoshida also issued a statement, shamelessly repeating the contents of Dulles' statement, confessing his crime of betraying the interests of the Japanese people.

This conspiracy plan by the US and Japanese reactionaries to harness Japan to the American war machine has aroused firm opposition from the Japanese people, and has even caused concern and opposition within the conservative camp. After Dulles and Yoshida issued their statements, Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, expressed dissatisfaction. He attacked Yoshida for arbitrarily making "promises to the Dulles mission: that Japan will re-arm itself after the peace treaty is signed." He said: "This issue needs to be seriously considered by the Japanese people." The Socialist Party also sent a letter to Dulles on the 10th, reiterating the party's position of advocating an overall peace treaty and opposing re-armament. The letter said: "Concluding a unilateral military agreement only with a specific country (referring to the United States) will instead expand the crisis of war and may make it impossible for Japan to achieve an overall peace treaty"; "Re-armament will not only not play a role in Japan's real security guarantee, but also will not contribute to world and Asian peace."

The largest bourgeois newspaper in Japan, the "Asahi Shimbun," also expressed dissatisfaction with the Yoshida government's behavior in an editorial on the 11th. The newspaper said: "Security measures after the conclusion of the peace treaty are a major issue for Japan and should be discussed and decided by all the people, not by a few government leaders." Another conservative Japanese newspaper, the "Mainichi Shimbun," with a circulation of more than 3 million copies, also believes that "bilateral or regional security measures" are "inappropriate." The newspaper worries that this approach "may cause countries that have not concluded a peace treaty with Japan to develop a hostile attitude." These facts reflect how unpopular the US-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy is.

　　杜勒斯与吉田公开发表声明
　  美日非法协议重新武装日本       
    这一战争计划已激起日本人民坚决反对
    日本保守阵营内部也纷纷表示忧虑不满
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：于一月二十五日抵达东京的杜鲁门的“特别代表”、战争贩子杜勒斯，在日本进行了十多天关于策划重新武装日本的活动，并与吉田反动政府获得默契后，已于十一日离开日本，飞抵马尼拉进行活动。
    杜勒斯在离日的前一天（十日）曾发表声明，公开承认美、日反动派业已协议重新武装日本使之充当美国的侵略工具。杜勒斯在声明中说：他在日本两个多星期与日本反动派讨论了：“一、先前曾与盟国讨论过的可能体现在和约中的原则。二、日本将来的安全问题。三、日本在恢复主权后遇到的经济问题。四、美日人民之间文化联系的发展。”杜勒斯并说：“在所有这些问题上已达到‘谅解’”。
    杜勒斯露骨地表示，所谓日本“安全”问题，实际上是：美军继续占领日本和重新武装日本，并根据侵略性的北大西洋公约的原则签订“美日军事同盟”，使日本充当美国在远东主要的侵略帮手。杜勒斯说：日本政府“欢迎美国愿以同情的态度考虑在日本境内及附近驻扎武装部队的建议”。“我们也曾讨论过美国与日本之间的临时安全措施，这方面我们已经指出一切具有确切性质的区域的或集体的安全措施”，由参加的各分子“继续不断的和有效的自助与互助。”
    在同一天，吉田也发表了一个声明，无耻地重复着杜勒斯声明的内容。自供了出卖日本人民利益的罪状。
    美、日反动派这一将日本套上美国战车的阴谋计划，激起日本人民的坚决反对，甚至在保守阵营内部也引起了忧虑以至反对。杜勒斯与吉田的声明发表后，社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎即表示不满。他攻击吉田擅自“对杜勒斯使团提出的诺言：在和约签订以后，日本将自行重新武装”。他说：“这个问题需要日本人民加以郑重的考虑。”社会党并曾于十日致函杜勒斯，再度说明该党主张全面媾和，反对重新武装。该函说：“只与特定国（按指美国）缔结片面的军事协定，反而会扩大战争的危机，有使日本不可能全面媾和之虑”；“重新武装对日本的真正的安全保障不但不起作用，且不能有助于世界及亚洲的和平。”
    日本最大的资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》在十一日的社论中，也不满吉田政府的行为。该报说：“和约缔结后之安全措施，乃日本之重大问题，应由全体人民商讨决定，而不应由少数政府领袖作主。”另一销数三百余万份的保守的日本报纸《每日新闻》也认为“双边或区域安全措施”“不当”。该报忧虑这种办法“可能使未与日本缔结和约的国家发生敌视态度”。这些事实反映出美日反动派的密谋是如何不得人心。
