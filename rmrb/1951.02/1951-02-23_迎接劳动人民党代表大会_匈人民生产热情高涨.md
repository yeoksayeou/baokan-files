    Hungarian People's Production Enthusiasm Soars
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] To greet the opening of the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Hungarian Stakhanovites have achieved great success in the first week of the socialist competition. Modula Sandor, a Stakhanovite and cutoff worker at the Rakosi United Factory, completed 880 percent of his work plan using new working methods on a cutoff machine. Youth League member Kereges Antal, a polishing worker, produced multiple patterns with a single spindle, completing 869 percent of his work plan. New Stakhanovites have emerged, surpassing the old Stakhanovites. In the Kispest City Textile Factory, thirty-six female textile workers increased the number of looms they operated simultaneously from twelve to fourteen each on the first day of the first week of the competition. Workers at the Hungarian Weaving Factory have exceeded their production quota, producing an extra 83,000 meters of fabric. Workers at the Csepel Island Automobile Factory completed their task for the opening of the Party Congress in the first week, producing twenty-four trucks. Mining team leader Vasas Ferencz increased coal excavation from eight carloads to twenty carloads. Representatives from fraternal parties, including Mongolia and Korea, have come to Budapest to attend the meeting, adding much prestige to the Hungarian capital.
