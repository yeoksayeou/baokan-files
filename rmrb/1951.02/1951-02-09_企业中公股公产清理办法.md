　　22. If there are indeed public shares and public assets in private enterprises that have not been reported to the government, the business executors of the enterprise shall report the public shares and public assets to the local government and apply for clearing within three months after the promulgation of these measures; those who fail to report within the deadline may be punished in accordance with the law.

　　　　　　F. Supplementary Provisions
