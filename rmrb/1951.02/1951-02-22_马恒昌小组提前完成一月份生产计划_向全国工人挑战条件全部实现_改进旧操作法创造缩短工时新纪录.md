Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: The Ma Hengchang Group has achieved all five challenge conditions they proposed to workers nationwide in January. 1. The group produced a total of 1,020 precision products in January without a single reject, achieving 100% quality and completing the plan five days ahead of schedule. 2. During the midday technical research sessions, workers studied together and became familiar with the use of Soviet-style lathes and areas requiring attention, and improved old operating methods, creating new records for shortening working hours. For example, the time it took Wang Zhanxue and Yi Kuiyuan to machine a lifting nut was reduced by about 30% compared to the fastest previous record. 3. Based on the past tradition of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and mutual assistance, the relationship between teachers and apprentices within the group has become even closer. Thanks to the teachers' enthusiastic guidance and the apprentices' willingness to learn, within just half a month, apprentices who were previously unable to produce independently have become familiar with the structure of Soviet-style lathes and can operate simple tasks on the lathe. Apprentices who were previously able to produce independently have now further mastered techniques such as polishing small shafts, arranging screws, and machining internal threads. Apprentices respect their teachers and cherish the machines, oiling them twice a day and staying ten minutes late after work to wipe them down. All tools in the group are assigned to specific individuals and neatly placed in toolboxes for the teachers to use at any time, never delaying the teachers' production. 4. The group's attendance rate in January reached 100%, with no one taking leave or being absent. 5. Conduct timely current affairs education to enhance workers' political awareness. In January, the group used blackboards to publicize the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan to the workers. Under the group's leadership, more than ninety workers in the entire workshop signed their names to protest this crime by the American and Japanese reactionaries against the Japanese working class. Starting from January 30th, the group established two reading groups to read newspapers and discuss current affairs issues from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM every day.

When summarizing their work in January, the Ma Hengchang Group further realized that to do a good job in production, it is necessary to unite technical personnel and staff, care about workers' lives, and do a good job in the work of the trade union group. Therefore, they decided to focus on doing three things well in February: 1. Further unite technical personnel and staff, and invite technician Zhou Yunzhang to give special lectures on the theoretical knowledge of high-speed cutting methods in his spare time. When the high-speed cutting method is trialed in February, invite the head of the planning section, the director of the manufacturing plant, and relevant technical personnel to provide technical guidance to ensure the smooth success of the high-speed cutting method trial. 2. Rationally allocate manpower, use machines, assign tasks, improve operating methods, and research special tools. 3. Promote the workers' class friendship and collectivism spirit, do a good job in mutual assistance, solve the individual workers’ living difficulties; assist the trade union to do a good job in family work, organize workers’ families to engage in sideline production; mobilize employees to actively participate in cooperatives, and enjoy material distribution benefits.

　　马恒昌小组提前完成一月份生产计划
    向全国工人挑战条件全部实现
    改进旧操作法创造缩短工时新纪录
    【新华社二十日讯】马恒昌小组已在一月份实现了他们向全国工人提出的五个挑战条件。一、一月份全组共作一千零二十件精密产品，没出一个废活，质量达到百分之百，并提前五天完成计划。二、在中午的技术研究会上，经过大家互相研究，工人们熟悉了苏联式车床的使用方法和应注意的地方，并改进了旧的操作法，创造了缩短工时的新纪录。如王占学、依奎元二人车一个升降螺母的时间，已比过去最快的纪录又缩短了约百分之三十。三、在过去尊师爱徒，团结互助的基础上，组内师徒关系更加密切。由于师傅热心带领，徒弟虚心学习，仅半个月时间，以前不能独立生产的徒工，已经熟悉了苏式车床的构造，并能上车床作简单活；以前能够独立生产的徒工，现在又进一步掌握了光小轴，排螺丝，车里螺等技术。徒工都能尊敬师傅，爱护机器，每天都在车上浇两次油，下班后晚走十分钟擦车子。组内一切工具，都有专人负责，整整齐齐地摆在工具箱内，随时供师傅使用，从来没有耽误过师傅生产。四、一月份全组出勤率达百分之百，没有一个请假或旷工的。五、及时进行时事教育，提高工人政治觉悟。一月份该组曾利用黑板报向工人进行了日本“松川事件”的宣传。在该组带头下，全车间九十多个工人都签了名，抗议美日反动派这一迫害日本工人阶级的罪行。从一月三十日起，该组成立了两个读报组，在每天下午七点到七点半读报和讨论时事问题。
    马恒昌小组在总结一月份工作时，进一步认识到要搞好生产，必须团结技术人员、职员，关心工人生活，搞好工会小组工作。因此他们决定要在二月份有重点地作好三件工作：一、进一步团结技术人员、职员，聘请技术员周蕴章在业余专门讲授高速度切削法的理论知识。二月份试行高速度切削法时，聘请计划科长、制造厂主任及有关技术人员作技术指导，使高速度切削法的试行顺利成功。二、合理地调配人力、使用机器、分配任务，改进操作方法，研究特殊工具。三、发扬工人阶级友爱和集体主义精神，做好互助工作，解决个别工人生活困难；协助工会做好家属工作，组织工人家属搞副业生产；发动职工积极参加合作社，享受物资配售待遇。
