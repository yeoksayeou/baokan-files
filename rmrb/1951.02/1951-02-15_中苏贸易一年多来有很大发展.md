Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Lin Haiyun, Director of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, told our reporter that Sino-Soviet trade has developed greatly over the past year. This is one of the important factors for the rapid recovery of our country's production.

    Sino-Soviet trade specifically demonstrates the solid unity and mutual assistance between the two countries, as well as the great friendship of the Soviet Union in enthusiastically helping China's economic construction. Through Sino-Soviet trade, our country has purchased a large number of valuable industrial equipment, transportation equipment, and agricultural machinery "blocked" and "prohibited from exporting to China" by imperialist countries. At the same time, our country supplies the Soviet people with agricultural and sideline products such as soybeans, silk, tea, and wool, which has reversed the long-term sluggish sales of these products in our country, and thus greatly increased the income of our people.

    In the process of Sino-Soviet trade, in order to help the Chinese people restore production, the Soviet government has also tried to increase its domestic consumption and purchased large quantities from our country for many goods that they could have self-supplied without importing. For example, local products such as fish and apples from Northeast China were sold to the Soviet Union in large quantities last year. On the other hand, for various commodities that our country temporarily and specifically needed, the Soviet Union tried its best to supply them even if they were outside the scope of the Sino-Soviet trade contract. For example, last autumn, the Soviet Union transferred a large amount of sugar from its Far East region to sell to our country, helping our country stabilize sugar prices.

    In Sino-Soviet trade, all commodity prices are negotiated based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and the exchange rates between the two sides are fixed, completely free from the impact of price fluctuations in the capitalist world market caused by the imperialist countries' war preparations. In terms of imported goods, the prices of Soviet goods are on average 20% to 30% cheaper than those in the US and British markets. Among them, important industrial equipment urgently needed by our country, such as some machine tools, are even about 30% to 60% cheaper than those in the US and British markets, which helps our country reduce industrial production costs. On the other hand, the prices of various goods exported from our country to the Soviet Union are also extremely reasonable, which is fundamentally different from the situation in which American and British capitalists force down prices and buy from us, thus enabling our government to purchase from farmers at reasonable prices and increase farmers' income. Taking four native products exported to the Soviet Union, such as peanut oil, soybeans, Xining wool, and tea, as examples, the average market price in Tianjin in June last year (converted into millet) was 128.5% higher than the average price in January 1948 during the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

    Due to the development of Sino-Soviet trade, our country's trade position in the world has rapidly improved; therefore, our country's trade with capitalist countries has also begun to be in an active position. At the same time, the imperialist economic blockade against us has instead increased their own difficulties. Under the conditions of the increasingly equal and mutually beneficial international trade between the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, our country will have more confidence to further restore and develop our country's production in accordance with the principle of self-reliance.

    中苏贸易一年多来有很大发展
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府贸易部国外贸易司林海云司长向本社记者发表谈话称：中苏贸易一年多以来已有很大的发展。这是我国生产事业得以迅速恢复的重要因素之一。
    中苏贸易具体地显示了两国间巩固的团结和互助以及苏联热烈帮助我国经济建设的伟大友谊。通过中苏贸易，我国从苏联购置了为帝国主义国家“封锁”、“禁止输华”的大批宝贵的工业设备、交通器材和农业机械；同时，我国以大豆、蚕丝、茶叶、羊毛等农、副业产品供给苏联人民，转变了我国这些产品长久滞销的局面，因而也就大大地增加了我国人民的收入。
    在中苏贸易过程中，苏联政府为帮助我国人民恢复生产，对于他们本可自给而无须进口的许多货物，也都设法增加其国内消费量，向我国大量购买。例如我东北的鱼产、苹果等土产，去年都曾大宗地卖给苏联。另一方面，对于我国临时特殊需要的各种商品，虽在中苏贸易合同的规定范围以外，苏联也都尽量供给。例如去年秋季，苏联曾从其远东地区调拨大量食糖卖给我国，帮助我国稳定糖价。
    在中苏贸易中，所有商品价格都是根据平等、互惠的原则议定的，并把双方比价固定，完全摆脱了资本主义世界市场因帝国主义国家备战所引起的物价波动的影响。在进口货物方面，苏联各货价格平均比美、英市价便宜百分之二、三十，其中为我国所亟需的重要工业设备如有些工作母机等，更比美、英市价便宜百分之三十到六十左右，这样就帮助我国减低了工业生产成本。另一方面，我国向苏联输出各货的价格也极为合理，根本不同于美、英资本家对我压价套买的情况，因而使得我国政府能以合理价格向农民收购，增加了农民的收入。以花生油、大豆、西宁羊毛、茶叶等对苏输出的四种土产为例，去年六月份天津平均市价（折合小米计算，下同）要比国民党反动统治时代一九四八年一月平均价提高百分之一百二十八点五。
    由于中苏贸易的发展，我国在世界上的贸易地位已经迅速提高；因而我国对资本主义国家的贸易也已开始处于主动地位。和这同时帝国主义对我的经济封锁却反而增加了他们自己的困难。在日益增加的苏联和各人民民主国家的平等互惠的国际贸易的条件下，我国将更有信心，进一步地按自力更生的原则，恢复和发展我国的生产。
