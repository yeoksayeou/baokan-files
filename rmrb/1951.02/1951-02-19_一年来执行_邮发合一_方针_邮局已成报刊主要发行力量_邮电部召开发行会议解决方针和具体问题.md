　　Having Implemented the "Unified Postal and Distribution System" for the Past Year
　　Post Offices Have Become the Main Force for Newspaper and Magazine Distribution
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Convened a Distribution Meeting to Resolve Principles and Specific Issues
    [Reported by this newspaper] The National Newspaper Management Conference in December 1949 and the National Postal Conference in January 1950 resolved to implement the principle of "Unified Postal and Distribution System." Since its implementation, the People's Post Office's distribution work has greatly advanced in the past year. The number of newspapers distributed increased from 73 to 140, and the number of copies distributed per issue increased from over 790,000 to 2.18 million, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of newspapers published nationwide. The number of periodicals distributed increased from over 30 to 122, with each issue reaching over 900,000 copies. The total number of books distributed as agents (Current Affairs Handbook, textbooks, popular readings, etc.) throughout the year was over 5.4 million copies. In 1950, due to the firm implementation of the "Unified Postal and Distribution System" principle, post offices have become the most fundamental and major distribution force nationwide. There are currently 55,449 post offices and branches nationwide, with postal routes totaling 925,536 li. All newspapers and magazines distributed by post offices can be distributed to any place with a post office nationwide, and readers can subscribe to various newspapers and periodicals issued in any region of the country at their local post office. The distribution speed has also greatly improved compared to the past. In Wuhan, it used to take 34 hours for newspapers to be delivered by the newspaper office itself, but after distribution by the post office, it can be distributed within one hour. The Dongsi Pailou Post Office in Beijing distributes 1,188 copies of this newspaper; before the "Unified Postal and Distribution System," it took three hours to complete the delivery, but after the "Unified Postal and Distribution System," it only takes half an hour. In the vast rural areas, newspapers in Jiangxi Province can be delivered from the county to the village within three days in 92% of the cases. In Shandong Province, newspapers arrive in the district in one day, in the township in two days, and in the village in three days. After the "Unified Postal and Distribution System," the number of newspapers and magazines has been increasing day by day. The circulation of this newspaper has increased from 90,000 copies in April 1950 to 190,000 copies in December, an increase of more than doubled. As for weekly magazines, "Outlook" has increased from 40,000 copies to 68,000 copies, and "New Children's Newspaper" has increased from 37,000 copies to 166,000 copies. At the same time, post offices in various places have universally opened newspaper and magazine subscription and sales offices and guaranteed the income of newspaper fees for newspaper and magazine publishers. They have also strengthened the management of private sales agencies and enhanced the prestige of the People's newspapers. The new achievements of the post office's distribution work in the past year have not only facilitated and satisfied the vast number of readers' demand for cultural nourishment, but also created conditions for the "planned distribution" of newspapers and magazines. The national newspaper and magazine distribution network, which is beginning to be organized with the post office as the center, has gradually penetrated into government agencies, troops, organizations, schools, factories, as well as remote villages and distant border areas. In order to better carry out the work of "Unified Postal and Distribution System," clarify the distribution principles and policies, and discuss and resolve some specific issues existing between newspaper offices and post offices after the "Unified Postal and Distribution System," the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications specially convened a national distribution work conference on February 15th, which will last for half a month. The conference will study the above-mentioned issues in detail to further improve the distribution work.

　　一年来执行“邮发合一”方针
　  邮局已成报刊主要发行力量     
    邮电部召开发行会议解决方针和具体问题
    【本报讯】一九四九年十二月全国报纸经理会议、一九五○年一月全国邮政会议决议了“邮发合一”的方针，执行以来，一年中人民邮局的发行工作大大地推进了一步。发行报纸由七十三种增到一百四十种，发行份数由每期发行七十九万多份增到二百十八万份，占全国报纸出版份数百分之七十以上；发行期刊由三十多种增到一百二十二种，每期发行份数已达到了九十多万份；代理图书（时事手册、教科书、通俗读物等）全年共五百四十多万册。一九五○年由于坚持贯彻了“邮发合一”的方针，邮局已经形成了全国范围内的最基本的最主要的发行力量。全国现有五万五千四百四十九个局所，邮路计达九十二万五千五百三十六里，凡是邮局所发行的报刊，可以发行到全国一切有邮局的地方，读者也可至当地邮局订阅到全国任何地区所发行的各种报纸和刊物。发行速度也较之过去大为提高，武汉的报纸过去由报社自己送要三十四小时，邮局发行后一小时就能分送完毕；北京东四牌楼邮局发行本报一千一百八十八份，“邮发合一”前三小时送完，“邮发合一”后，半小时就能送完；在广大农村里，江西省从县到村，百分之九十二在三天以内可以送到；山东省的报纸一天到区，两天到乡，三天到村。“邮发合一”后，报刊的份数是日益上升的，本报从一九五○年四月的九万份增到十二月的十九万份，即增加了一倍多；周刊方面，“展望”从四万份增到六万八千份，新少年报从三万七千份增到十六万六千份。同时各地邮局普遍开办了报刊订销局和保证了报刊社的报费收入。并对私营代销处加强了管理，提高了人民报纸的威信。一年来邮局发行工作的新的成就，不仅便利和满足了广大读者对文化食粮的要求，而且也为报刊“计划发行”创造了条件。以邮局为中心，开始组织着的全国性的报刊发行网，已逐渐深入到机关、部队、团体、学校、工厂，以及偏僻的乡村和遥远的边疆。为了更好地开展“邮发合一”的工作，明确发行的方针和政策，讨论解决报社和邮局双方在“邮发合一”后存在的一些具体问题，邮电部特于二月十五日召开全国发行工作会议，为期半月，将详细研究上述诸问题，把发行工作更提高一步。
