Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 22nd: Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, delivered a report at the afternoon session of the World Peace Council on February 21st regarding the implementation of the program of the Second World Peace Congress. Nenni stated: The World Peace Council meeting is opening in Berlin three months after the conclusion of the Warsaw Congress. The World Peace Council must first discuss the implementation or impending implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. These resolutions, especially the letter to the United Nations, have received enthusiastic responses from public opinion worldwide. The Council Secretariat sent the letter to the United Nations to the President of the United Nations Security Council, the representative of the People's Republic of China, the permanent members of the Security Council, the heads of delegations, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Secretariat also sent this document to heads of state, all international trade union organizations, and local churches.

　　National peace committees have taken substantial measures. France launched a campaign to collect signatures on a declaration against the rearmament of Germany and initiated a campaign to write to mayors demanding that they condemn French rearmament. In Italy, the Peace Council published a letter to mayors and city councils, sent letters to priests and Italian emigrants in the United States, and wrote an open letter to Italian parliamentarians. The activities of the Italian Peace Council have led to widespread support from various sectors of society, even parliament, for the convening of a five-nation conference to resolve the Far East issue and a four-nation conference to address the German question. In Germany (the German Democratic Republic and West Germany), many pamphlets and leaflets have been published to widely publicize the resolutions of the Warsaw Congress, especially those concerning the reunification of Germany and the eradication of German militarism. In the United Kingdom, a signature campaign was conducted under the auspices of the London Peace Committee, and conferences were held to defend world peace and oppose the rearmament of Germany. Committees for the struggle against the rearmament of Germany have been established in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the United States, sixty-five prominent figures, including Thomas Mann, Pauling, Morrison, Dahl, Fast, Robertson, and Dr. Du Bois, initiated the organization of the American Peace Crusade, a part of which is the peace petition delegation scheduled to go to Washington on March 1st. In Brazil and Argentina, a two-week nationwide anti-war campaign was conducted from January 1st to January 16th. One of the most important measures that should be mentioned is the establishment of the Franco-Belgian alliance against the rearmament of Germany, and agreements have also been concluded between French and German trade unions for this purpose.

　　Generally speaking, thanks to the success of the Warsaw Congress and the publication of the letter to the United Nations, our movement has achieved considerable development in all countries of the world, although it still encounters obstacles of misunderstanding in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries, and even persecution in Spain, Yugoslavia, and many countries in Latin America.

　　In the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and China, the letter to the United Nations has received widespread publicity and discussion, and has been endorsed by the entire population of these countries. It can be said that it has become the basis for government policy and the activities of broad people's organizations. In accordance with the fifth recommendation of the letter to the United Nations, the parliaments of Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Albania have all promulgated laws for the defense of peace. In Cuba, Italy, and Uruguay, laws for the defense of peace will also be submitted to parliament for discussion.

　　Throughout Asia and a considerable part of Africa, the letter to the United Nations has been widely received among the people oppressed by the shackles of colonialism and who are openly struggling against imperialism, because the colonial and semi-colonial peoples know that their liberation in the future is closely linked to the struggle against a new imperialist war.

　　Our World Peace Council will receive many reports on other measures sufficient to prove the scale of the worldwide peace movement.

　　However, we have never made the absurd claim that we are the only defenders of peace, although we firmly believe that our peace movement is the most solid and consistent. When our Executive Bureau met in Geneva in January, it established contact for the first time with the "World Government Movement," learned of the great significance of the British "Peace with China" movement, which united a considerable number of members of the British Labour Party. Our Executive Bureau also learned of the possibility of expanding the movement organized by the "Peace Policy Committee" in the United States, learned of the activeness of the churches, and learned of the scale of the neutrality movement in France, Italy, and other countries, which, in the event of war, would be used by American and British imperialism as strategic bases and barriers.

　　We now have a great possibility of cooperating with all these movements, as long as these movements do not - for example, like certain neutrality movements - deviate from the resolutions on specific issues of defending peace, and do not deviate from the obligation to fight against warmongers and realize practical peace resolutions. Uniting these movements, guiding them in accordance with the principles of specific decisions and specific actions, and linking them with the masses of the people - this is one of the central tasks of our Council. Because if we do not carry out persistent daily activities, then the "Letter to the United Nations" will no longer be an effective peace charter and a source of ever-changing and expanding activities.

　　The "Letter to the United Nations," which was drafted and adopted three months ago, still retains its relevance. None of the recommendations made in the "Letter to the United Nations" have been accepted by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. This fact itself shows how far we are from the goals we have set, and how far we are from resolving the bloody conflict that is being waged in parts of the world and may plunge all mankind into a new war.

　　What is the situation today?

　　First, the Korean War continues. When the Second World Peace Congress met in Warsaw, it seemed that the American intervention in Korea would soon end in victory. The Korean People's Army, exhausted by a long and unequal battle, was retreating. Later, under the combined pressure of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers (the Chinese People's Volunteers took action when the American army and Chiang Kai-shek colluded and attacked the Chinese border with undisguised provocation and aggression), MacArthur's army suffered a serious setback.

　　The Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations have not prescribed any solution to the conflict. The Chinese delegation was invited to Lake Success by the Political Committee of the United Nations, but had to leave the United States because the American delegation stubbornly refused to include the issue of American interference in Taiwan (Formosa) on the agenda, and no measures could be taken. The United Nations, following the will of the White House and the American Senate, unhesitatingly passed an unjust resolution declaring China an "aggressor" at its meeting on February 1, worsening the situation. In doing so, the United Nations denied China's right to defend its own borders, while at the same time recognizing America's right to fight for its "survival and security" (President Truman's words) five thousand miles from its shores.

　　In Vietnam, just as in Korea, the war continues because there is no institution that can enforce a cessation of military action and resort to mediation.

　　Thus, the United Nations is increasingly exposing its inability to fulfill the lofty task entrusted to it by the people, that is, its inability to ensure peace and tranquility throughout the world. Our congress in Warsaw pointed out that a conference of the five major powers - the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China - concerned with the Far East issue is the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the current differences. However, not only has the five-nation conference not been held, but China has once again been deprived of the right to participate in the United Nations. In addition, all efforts by India and the Arab countries to bring opposing opinions closer together have failed because American militarists are unwilling to reconcile. The rulers of America openly declare that they only trust in force, although their force has suffered a crushing defeat in Korea.

　　Second, the arms expansion movement continues. In the seventh recommendation of the "Letter to the United Nations," the Warsaw World Peace Congress recommended that the major powers simultaneously and gradually reduce all active military forces - army, air force, and navy - by one-third to one-half between 1951 and 1952. At the same time, the congress pointed out how measures to control the prohibition of atomic weapons could be implemented. The Soviet delegation submitted these recommendations to the United Nations, but they were rejected. Since then, the arms expansion movement has intensified.

　　American hysteria has reached such a degree that a state of emergency was declared on December 15th of last year. This is the most serious thing that can be imagined in peacetime. The military budget reaches $41.8 billion, not including funds allocated to the Atomic Energy Commission.

　　Britain, allowing itself to be dragged down the road taken by the United States, has allocated an initial sum of £3.6 billion for rearmament; and after Attlee's meeting with Truman in Washington, the military expenditure increased to £4.7 billion. The Labour ministers themselves admit that this has caused a reduction in civilian production and endangered the economy of the entire country and the living standards of the people.

　　France, burdened with the heavy burden of the Vietnam War, is not only burdened with a military budget of 750 billion francs, but also with a budget that is about to reach 1 trillion francs. All of this is disproportionate to France's strength and resources.

　　In Italy, the standard of living of the people is the lowest in Europe; on January 1, 2,122,024 people were unemployed (this indicates an increase of 328,193 unemployed people compared to the previous month). At present, parliament is discussing additional military appropriations of approximately 250 billion lire.

　　Other countries in the North Atlantic group are proceeding with the arms expansion movement at the same rate. Without a complete change in America's war policy, the arms expansion movement will not stop. Every expenditure gives rise to new expenditures. Taking a step forward along the path of organizing a "unified army" commanded by Eisenhower (as decided by the sixth meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council) requires taking another step forward. This path leads either to economic collapse, or to war, or to both, or, most likely, to a long period of neither peace nor war, a period that will create particularly favorable conditions for various adventures, including fascist and Nazi-style adventures.

　　Third, the United States is arming Japan and Germany. It disregards not only the dangers emphasized by our congress, but also the resistance encountered by the act of arming Japan in Asia and Australia, and the resistance encountered by the act of arming Germany in Europe and on German soil.

　　Our Peace Council must discuss this issue on the basis of a special report. At present, it is enough to emphasize one point: it is clear from Eisenhower's statement to the 82nd American Congress that postponing the arming of Germany is of strategic importance. The intention is to eliminate the suspicion and anxiety of countries bordering Germany and to prepare for war. They declare that it is possible to arm Germans without arming Germany. This is simply hypocrisy.

　　The truth is that arming Germany under the pretext of defending Europe against an imaginary Soviet aggression will lead to war.

　　Fourth, the American policy of creating situations and resolutions by relying on strength is the cause of the situation in the Far East and Central Europe. This policy was once again confirmed by the following words of Mr. Acheson, the leader of American diplomacy. He said: Negotiations with the Soviet Union can only be conducted after a situation of strength has been created. At present, the United States is trying to create such a situation in Yugoslavia (on the pretext that Yugoslavia may be attacked by its neighbors), in the eastern part of the Mediterranean, and in the Middle East and Near East. The travels of American politicians (Bohlen to Belgrade and Rome, Finley to Angola, Hickok to Istanbul), the recent meetings of American diplomats in Middle Eastern and Near Eastern countries, including Pakistan (American military leaders also participated in this meeting), the exercises of the American and British navies in the Mediterranean, and the new policy towards France (these things all happened at the same time) - all of these prove that America is currently engaged in creating this region where strength can be exerted, including Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, as well as Israel, Lebanon, North Africa, and Sicily. The intention is to create a direct threat to the security of the Soviet Union and to place the oil center of the Caucasus and the mining and industrial areas of Ukraine under the attack of the atomic air force.

　　Thus, the governments of the United States and the North Atlantic Group countries, by not adopting the recommendations of our World Peace Congress, are constantly aggravating the situation in the four locations in the world that have already created tension, and are turning the United Nations into a pro-American organization that serves the American policy of aggression. However, our World Peace Council will once again firmly affirm, repeating Stalin's words: War is not inevitable.

　　At present, the militarist camp has fallen apart due to the increasingly sharp contradictions within the Atlantic alliance. It can be said that the arms expansion movement will disarm Western Europe, because it will cause economic and political collapse, first in the weakest countries, and then throughout the group. The number of armaments is insufficient to wage war, and even less sufficient to win it. One of the giants of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Schuster of Milan - infamous in the past for sheltering fascists, and equally infamous today for his hatred of peace fighters - recently said: "It is useless to prepare weapons and soldiers to defend the country in the event of war when two million unemployed are left unattended, because these people will join the Fifth Column against us tomorrow."

　　On the other hand, Eisenhower, after returning to the United States from Europe, was also able to recognize how far the obligations undertaken by governments are from the will of the people. He said in the American Congress that the decisive factor in a possible war is emotion. He even had to admit how "hypocritical and foolish" it was to deny the "almost defeatist pessimism" that exists in many social strata in Europe.

　　In addition, the kind of rhetoric used to slander us, the nonsense in the declarations of representatives of the imperialist camp (Truman, Hoover, Taft, Attlee, Plevin, Adenauer, etc., who only have hatred in common, and whose opinions are not truly consistent), and the measures of suppression and division that they have had to take, all emphasize the fragility of the policy of the North Atlantic Group.

　　Eisenhower toured Europe, especially Italy and France, behind police posts. France has taken measures to prohibit the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating within French territory. The Italian government once wanted to bring the Italian Peace Council to trial. When the people held demonstrations protesting the American general's stay in Rome, three peace fighters were shot and killed.

　　In New York, the propaganda station of the peace fighters has been dissolved, and its members will be tried as criminals. In the struggle against peace fighters, American blacks are subjected to more persecution. The strike of American railway workers and the strike of British dockworkers have aroused the emergency measures and anger of the imperialists. They are trying to build an iron curtain in every country to cut off our connection with a portion of the people most susceptible to official propaganda. However, we have established contact with honest people of various inclinations who, like us, do not want war. The warmongers cannot help but arouse the shock of public opinion and the movement of people who defend freedom, labor, and bread by rearming and preparing for war. Because of these insurmountable contradictions, their situation is very difficult. This shock of public opinion and this people's movement have instead made them lose everything they hoped to gain. Recently, we have seen the fraternization of the leaders of the North Atlantic Group with Franco and German Hitlerites, and their defense of Tito. Therefore, they have exposed themselves in front of the honest people who are still deceived by their solemn declarations of defending freedom, independence, and Western civilization. The first meeting of the World Peace Council recognized the gradual deterioration of the situation, and recognized that peace is at its most critical juncture, and that a sinister hand can strangle it at any time. In Europe, our meeting place, Berlin, is where the danger of war is most evident.

　　But we should not underestimate the opportunity to stop the actions that are heading straight for war and the abyss - these opportunities are great. We should not underestimate the growing strength of the world peace movement. Our Council is a manifestation of this strength. The peace program we formulated in Warsaw, contained in the "Letter to the United Nations," is more effective than ever before. Our World Peace Council must study methods of promoting this program and ensuring its adoption. We must always be true to one thing: peace - this is a hard struggle, as long as we conduct a brave, persevering, and unyielding struggle to guide the will of the people of all countries who love peace to oppose the evils of imperialist war, this struggle will be won.

　　Finally, based on recent events, the tasks of the first meeting of our World Peace Council can be defined as follows:

　　(1) To expose the disintegration and bankruptcy of the United Nations in the face of world opinion, from now on the United Nations is only a tool of the American policy of force, provocation, and aggression, and it must be restored to its original mission.

　　(2) To resolutely and decisively condemn the declaration of China as an aggressor, because China is defending its own survival, is defending against the conspiracies of MacArthur and his ally Chiang Kai-shek, and is defending the right of the people of Asian countries to be masters in their own homes.

　　(3) To strive for the convening of a meeting of representatives of the five major powers to resolve the conflict in the Far East, and to strive for the convening of a meeting of representatives of the four major powers to reunify Germany and eradicate militarism.

　　(4) To organize a worldwide propaganda campaign to explain the truth and expose the false pretexts on which the American policy of force is based, which is the insistence that the North Atlantic Alliance is defending the world and Europe from the threat of Soviet "aggression."

　　(5) To organize national and international resistance movements to resist the arms expansion movement and its consequences, which are: the transformation of peacetime industry into a wartime system, the decline of large-scale public undertakings of public importance that benefit all the people, and the declining living standards of the masses.

　　The World Peace Council, with its unity and unwavering struggle, will surely gain the trust of the people of all countries that the United Nations has lost, and will complete its supreme task - to consolidate peace and rid mankind of the scourge of a third world war.

　　在世界和平理事会会议上
    南尼报告二届和大纲领执行情况
    提出本届理事会议巩固和平的五项任务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十二日电：世界和平理事会执行局副主席南尼在世界和平理事会二十一日下午会议上发表了关于第二届世界和平大会纲领执行情况的报告。南尼称：世界和平理事会会议在华沙大会闭幕后三个月在柏林开幕了。世界和平理事会首先必须讨论第二届世界和平大会的决议实行或即将实行的情况。这些决议特别是致联合国书获得了全世界舆论的热烈响应。理事会秘书处曾以致联合国书分别送达联合国安全理事会主席、中华人民共和国代表、安全理事会各常任理事国、各国代表团团长及联合国秘书长。秘书处并将这一文件送交各国元首、一切国际工会组织及各地教会。
    各国和平委员会已纷纷采取了规模相当大的措施。法国发动了征集在反对武装德国宣言上签名的运动，并发起致书要求各市长指责法国重整军备的运动。在意大利，和平理事会曾发表告各市长及市议会书，曾致函教士以及侨居美国的意大利侨民，并写公开信给意大利的议员。意大利和平理事会的活动已使广大的各界人士甚至议会都起来支持召开解决远东问题的五国会议和处理德国问题的四国会议。在德国（德意志民主共和国和西德），为广泛宣传华沙大会的决议，尤其是关于重新统一德国与肃清德国军国主义问题的决议，出版了许多小册子和传单。在英国，在伦敦和平委员会的主持下进行了征集签名运动，并举行了保卫世界和平及反对武装德国的会议。在比利时和荷兰建立了反对武装德国的斗争委员会。在美国，六十五个名流，其中包括托玛斯·曼、包林、摩里逊、达尔、法斯特、罗伯逊及杜波依斯博士等人，发起组织美国和平十字军，其中的一部分就是定于三月一日到华盛顿去的和平请愿队。在巴西和阿根廷，从一月一日至一月十六日，曾进行为期两周的全国性的反对战争的运动。应该提到的具有最重要意义的措施之一是建立了反对重新武装德国的法比联盟，而且法国与德国工会之间也为这个目的缔结了协定。
    大致说来，由于华沙大会的胜利和致联合国书的发表，我们的运动已在世界一切国家内获得了相当大的发展，尽管它在美国、英国及斯堪的纳维亚各国仍然遭遇到缺乏了解的障碍，并且在西班牙、南斯拉夫和拉丁美洲许多国家甚至还遭受到迫害。
    在苏联，在人民民主国家和中国，致联合国书获得了广泛的宣传与讨论，并且获得这些国家中全体人民的赞同。可以说它已成为政府的政策与广大的人民团体的活动的基础。依照致联合国书第五项建议，匈牙利、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、波兰和阿尔巴尼亚各国议会均已颁布了保卫和平法案。在古巴、意大利和乌拉圭，保卫和平法案也将提交议会讨论。
    在整个亚洲和非洲的相当大的地区内，致联合国书在受殖民地枷锁压迫和正在公开与帝国主义斗争的人民中间得到广泛的响应，因为殖民地与半殖民地人民知道：今后他们的解放是与反对新的帝国主义战争的斗争紧密地联结在一起了。
    我们的世界和平理事会将会接到关于其他足以证明全世界和平运动之规模的措施的许多报告。
    然而我们从没有提出荒谬的说法，认为我们是唯一的和平保卫者，虽然我们深信我们的和平运动是最坚实、最一贯的。我们的执行局一月间在日内瓦开会时，第一次与“世界政府运动”建立了联系，知道了英国的“对中国和平”运动的巨大的意义，这个运动团结了相当一部分英国工党的党员。我们的执行局也知道了扩大美国的“和平政策委员会”所组织的运动的可能性，知道了教会的积极性，也知道了法国、意大利和其他一些国家中要求中立的运动的规模，如果发生战争，这些国家会被美英帝国主义当作战略基地和屏障。
    我们现在有很大的可能和这一切运动实行合作，只要这些运动并不——举例来说，像某些中立运动那样——背离关于保卫和平的具体问题的决议，不背离向战争贩子进行斗争，实现切实可行的和平决议的义务。团结这种种运动，遵照具体决定和具体行动的方针指导它们，把它们和人民群众联系起来——这就是我们理事会的中心任务之一。因为如果不进行坚持的日常活动，那末“致联合国书”将不再成为有效的和平宪章和日新月异、不断扩大的活动的源泉。
    三个月以前拟定和通过的“致联合国书”仍保有它的现实性。“致联合国书”中所提出的各项建议，没有一项被安全理事会或联合国大会所接受。这个事实本身就表明我们离开我们所确定的目标究竟有多远，我们离开已在世界的部分地区进行的可能把全人类投入新战争的血腥冲突的解决究竟有多远。
    今天的情况是怎样呢？
    第一，朝鲜战争还在继续。当第二届世界和平大会在华沙开会时，美国对朝鲜的干涉似乎不久就要胜利结束。当时被长久的实力悬殊的战斗弄得筋疲力倦的朝鲜人民军正在撤退。后来在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军（中国人民志愿军在美国军队和蒋介石狼狈为奸、怀着难以掩饰的挑衅和侵略的目的进攻到中国边界时采取了行动）的联合的压力下，麦克阿瑟的军队遭受了严重的挫折。
    安全理事会和联合国大会都没有规定出任何解决冲突的办法。中国代表团应联合国政治委员会之邀到成功湖，但由于美国代表团顽固地拒绝把美国干涉台湾（福摩萨）问题列入议程，不能采取任何措施，因而不得不离开美国。联合国遵奉白宫和美国参院的意志，毫不犹豫地在二月一日的会议上通过了宣布中国为“侵略者”的不公正的决定而使形势恶化，这样，联合国就否认了中国保卫本国边界的权利，而同时却承认美国有权在离它的海岸五千英里远的地方为它的“生存与安全”（杜鲁门总统的话）而斗争。
    在越南，正像在朝鲜一样，由于没有一个能够强制军事行动中止而诉诸调停的机构，战争仍在继续之中。
    这样，联合国愈益暴露了它没有能力完成人民授予它的崇高任务，这就是说，它没有能力确保全世界的安宁与和平。我们在华沙举行的大会指出，与远东问题有关的五大国——美、法、苏、英、中华人民共和国——会议是走向和平解决目前分歧的第一步。然而，不但五国会议没有举行，而且中国再度被剥夺了参加联合国的权利。此外，印度与阿拉伯国家使相反的意见趋于接近的一切努力，都因为美国的军国主义分子不肯调和而以失败告终。美国的统治者公开宣称，他们只信赖武力，虽然他们的武力已在朝鲜遭到了惨败。
    第二，扩张军备运动仍在继续。华沙世界和平大会在“致联合国书”的第七项建议中建议各大国在一九五一年至一九五二年期间，按比例同时逐渐裁减一切现役军队——陆军、空军和海军——，从三分之一到二分之一。同时，大会指出了用什么方法能够实现管制禁止原子武器的措施。苏联代表团把这些建议提交联合国，然而却遭到拒绝。此后，扩张军备运动又加紧了。
    美国的歇斯底里已经到了这样的程度，以至于在去年十二月十五日宣布了紧急状态。这种事情是在和平时期可以设想的一切事情中最严重的事情。军事预算达到四百一十八亿美元，其中还不包括拨给原子能委员会的款项。
    让自己被拖上美国所走的道路的英国，拨出第一批款项三十六亿英镑供重整军备之用；而在艾德礼到华盛顿与杜鲁门会晤之后，军费就增加到四十七亿英镑。工党大臣们自己也承认这造成民用生产的减少，并使整个国家的经济和人民的生活水平遭到危险的后果。
    法国担负着越南战争的重担，不仅如此，还担负着七千五百亿法郎军事预算的重担，并且这个预算即将到达一万亿法郎。所有这一切都是与法国的力量和资财不相称的。
    在意大利，人民的生活水平是欧洲最低的；在一月一日，有二百一十二万二千零二十四人失业（这表示失业人数较前一个月增加了三十二万八千一百九十三人）。而目前议会却正在讨论追加军事拨款约二千五百亿里拉。
    北大西洋集团的其他国家正以同样的速度进行扩张军备运动。美国的战争政策不彻底改变，扩张军备的运动是不会停止的。每一项开支都引起新的开支。沿着组织以艾森豪威尔为统帅（这是由北大西洋公约理事会第六次会议所决定的）的“统一军队”的道路前进一步就需要再前进一步。这一条道路不是导向经济崩溃，就是导向战争，或是导向二者兼而有之的局面，或者，最可能的是，导向一个既无和平又无战争的悠长的时期，这样的一个时期将为各种冒险，包括法西斯及纳粹式的冒险，创造特别有利的条件。
    第三，美国正在武装日本与德国。它不但不顾我们的大会所强调指出的危险，而且不顾武装日本的行为在亚洲及澳洲所遭遇到的抵抗以及武装德国的行为在欧洲及德国本土所遭遇到的抵抗。
    我们的和平理事会一定要根据专门的报告来讨论这个问题。在目前，只要强调指出一点就够了：从艾森豪威尔在八十二届美国国会发表的声明中可以清楚地看出，延期武装德国是有其策略上的重要性的。用意就是在于消除与德国毗邻的各国的猜疑与焦虑，并且准备作战。他们声言：武装德国人而不武装德国是可能的。这简直是虚伪。
    借口保卫欧洲，防范臆造的苏联的侵略而武装德国，就会导向战争，这是真理。
    第四，美国创造凭借实力的形势与定局的政策，是造成远东与中欧所发生的局势的原因。这个政策再度为美国外交领袖艾奇逊先生下面的话所证实。他说：只有在创造了实力的形势后才能和苏联进行谈判。目前，美国力图在南斯拉夫（借口是南斯拉夫可能遭到它的邻国的攻击）、在地中海的东部和中东及近东创造这种形势。美国政治家们的旅行（波金斯到贝尔格莱德和罗马，芬立脱到安哥拉，麦克希到伊斯坦堡），美国在中东近东各国包括巴基斯坦在内的外交家最近举行的会议（美国军事首长也参加了这个会议），美英海军在地中海的演习，以及对法国的新政策（这些事情都同时发生）——所有这些都证明：目前美国正从事于创造这种可以施用实力的地区，包括南斯拉夫、希腊、土耳其以及以色列、黎巴嫩、北非及西西里。用意就是创造对苏联安全的直接威胁，并把高加索的石油中心及乌克兰的采矿及工业地区置于原子空军的袭击之下。
    这样，美国及北大西洋集团各国的政府由于不采用我们的世界和平大会的建议，正在不断地使世界上四个目前已造成了紧张状态的地点的局势进一步严重化，并把联合国变成为美国侵略政策服务的亲美的组织。可是，我们世界和平理事会将再度坚决肯定，重述斯大林的话：战争不是不可避免的。
    目前，由于大西洋联盟的矛盾日益尖锐化，军国主义者的阵营已四分五裂。可以说，扩张军备运动将解除西欧的武装，因为这将造成经济与政治的崩溃，首先是在最弱小的国家，后来将遍及整个集团。军备的数量是不足以进行战争的，要赢得战争更是不够。天主教教会巨头之一、米兰枢机主教许斯特——过去因为庇护法西斯分子而臭名远扬，目前因为仇视和平战士而同样臭名昭彰——最近说：“当二百万的失业者被弃置不顾的时候，来准备武器和兵士以备战争发生时保卫国家是没有用的，因为这些人明天就会参加第五纵队反对我们。”
    在另一方面，艾森豪威尔自欧洲回国之后，也能够认识到各国政府所承担的义务与人民的意志是相去得多么远。他在美国国会上说，在可能发生的战争中决定的因素是情绪。他甚至不得不承认，否认欧洲许多社会阶层中存在着的“近乎失败主义的悲观情绪”是多么的“虚伪和愚蠢”。
    此外，用来诬蔑我们的那种论调，帝国主义阵营的代表们（杜鲁门、胡佛、塔夫脱、艾德礼、普利文、阿登纳等只有憎恨是共同的，他们的意见并没有做到真正一致）声明中的那种胡言乱语，他们不得不采取的镇压与分化措施，这些都着重表现了北大西洋集团政策的脆弱。
    艾森豪威尔躲在警察的岗哨后面巡游欧洲，特别是意大利和法国。法国采取了措施，禁止世界工联、国际民主妇联、世界民主青联在法国国境内活动。意大利政府一度要把意大利和平理事会交付审讯。在人民举行抗议美国将军逗留罗马的示威时，有三个和平战士被开枪杀害了。
    在纽约，和平战士的宣传站已被解散，它的成员将作为犯人而受审。在对和平战士进行的斗争中，美国的黑人受到更多的迫害。美国铁路工人的罢工和英国码头工人的罢工引起了帝国主义者的紧急措施和愤怒。他们企图在每个国家中建立一种铁幕，以割断我们和一部分最易受官方宣传所影响的人们之间的联系。但是，我们还是与那些像我们一样不希望战争的有各种倾向的正直人民建立了联系。战争贩子们要重整军备和准备战争就不能不引起舆论的震动和保卫自由、劳动和面包的人民运动。由于这些不可克服的矛盾，他们的处境是很困难的。这种舆论的震动和这种人民运动反而使他们失去了他们希望得到的一切东西。近来我们看见了北大西洋集团的领袖们与佛朗哥及德国希特勒分子的亲善，和他们为铁托进行辩护。因此，他们就在仍被他们的保卫自由、独立和西方文明的郑重声明所欺骗的正直人民面前暴露了自己。世界和平理事会的第一届会议认识到局势的逐渐恶化，认识到和平已处在最危急的关头，罪恶的手随时可以把它扼杀。在欧洲，我们的会议地点柏林就是战争的危险表现得最明显的地方。
    但是我们不应过低估计制止径直奔向战争和深渊的行动的机会——这些机会是很大的。我们不应过低估计世界和平运动的日渐增长的力量。我们的理事会就是这种力量的表现。我们在华沙制定的包含在“致联合国书”中的和平纲领比以前任何时候都更加有效。我们的世界和平理事会必须研究宣传这个纲领并使这一纲领得到采纳的方法。我们必须永远忠于一件事：和平——这是一个艰苦的斗争，只要进行勇猛、坚忍、不屈不挠的斗争，以引导各国人民爱好和平的意志去反对帝国主义战争的罪恶，就会赢得这一斗争。
    最后，根据最近的事件，我们世界和平理事会第一届会议的任务可以确定如下：
    （一）在世界舆论面前揭露联合国的分崩离析和破产，从此以后联合国只不过是美国的武力、挑衅和侵略政策的工具而已，必须使之恢复它原来的任务。
    （二）坚决果敢地谴责宣布中国为侵略者，因为中国是在保卫它自己生存，是在防御麦克阿瑟及其同盟者蒋介石的阴谋，并且是在保卫亚洲各国人民做自己家中主人的权利。
    （三）争取召开五大国代表会议以解决远东的冲突，争取召开四大国代表会议以使德国重新统一与肃清军国主义。
    （四）组织世界规模的宣传运动，以阐释真相与揭发美国武力政策所依据的虚伪口实，这种口实就是硬说北大西洋联盟是保卫世界及欧洲使其不受苏联“侵略”的威胁。
    （五）组织全国与国际规模的抵抗运动，抵抗扩张军备运动与其后果，这些后果是：把和平时期工业改行战时体制，使具有公众重要性而有利于全体人民的大规模公共事业每况愈下，使群众的生活水准日益下降。
    世界和平理事会以其团结一致、始终不渝的斗争必能获得联合国所丧失的各国人民的信任，并完成它的最高任务——巩固和平，为人类驱除第三次世界大战的恶魔。
