Seeing Our People's Country Through the Redemption of Principal and Interest on Public Bonds
    Xiao Yincai

    The first lottery for the redemption of principal on the 1950 First Phase People's Victory Parity Bonds was held publicly in the people's capital on the 1st. All principal of bonds drawn in this lottery and the interest due this time will be paid out by local People's Banks starting March 31st. The 1950 First Phase People's Victory Parity Bonds, totaling 100 million shares, were issued starting January 5th, 1950. By late March, in less than three months, the sales task had been basically and successfully completed, with some areas even exceeding their quotas. Overseas Chinese were very active in purchasing bonds, all of which demonstrated the patriotic spirit of the people throughout the country and overseas Chinese. Some shortcomings occurred in the process of promoting bond sales in various places, which have since been corrected. The issuance of the People's Victory Parity Bonds played an important role in tightening currency, making up for fiscal deficits, and helping to stabilize finance and prices.

    The issuance and successful completion of the 1950 First Phase People's Victory Parity Bonds, as well as the timely implementation of lottery redemption of principal and interest, also reflect the superiority of the Chinese people's democratic regime from this aspect. This superiority is manifested in the fact that the issuance of public bonds is entirely for the benefit of the people and relies on and leads the people to complete this task; it is manifested in the fact that this government is the most responsible and most efficient government in Chinese history.

    Looking back at the issuance of public bonds one year after their issuance, we can more clearly see that the purpose of the Central People's Government in issuing the People's Victory Parity Bonds was entirely for the people. Because in the winter of 1949 and the beginning of 1950, the national finances had not yet been balanced, and finance and prices had not yet been stabilized. In 1950, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure still had a deficit of 18.7%. In order to avoid inflation and protect the interests of the people, the People's Government decided to issue 200 million shares of public bonds, accounting for 7.2% of the state's expenditure, and later, in order to take care of the people's economic capabilities, only 100 million shares were issued. Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his report on the price problem and the issuance of public bonds on December 2, 1949: "The role of this kind of public bond lies in making up for part of the fiscal deficit. It is also a burden for the people to purchase public bonds under the current difficult economic circumstances. But this burden is better than the loss caused by the increase in the issuance of banknotes and the fall in currency prices. Because as a result of the fall in currency prices, the value of the falling part is completely lost. The public bonds purchased are a burden at the moment, but they can ultimately be repaid with principal and interest, which is not a loss. If the result of issuing public bonds to reduce the deficit improves the currency value and price situation next year compared to this year, it will not only benefit the working people who live on wages and the military, government, public, and teaching staff, but it will also benefit the normal operation of industry and commerce. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of all the people, issuing public bonds is better than issuing more banknotes." Facts have proved that the issuance of parity bonds has achieved obvious results in stopping inflation and stabilizing finance and prices. At that time, there was also another purpose opposite to this in issuing public bonds, and another method opposite to this, which was the public bond policy implemented by the Kuomintang government, which the Chinese people were very familiar with and deeply hated. The public bonds wantonly issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries, totaling more than 60 types in the more than 20 years of its rule in China, were aimed not only at harming the people politically, but also at plundering the people economically. In 1938, "Gold Public Bonds" (in denominations of 10,000 yuan and pounds) were issued, and in 1940, so-called "Construction Gold Public Bonds" (also in denominations of 10,000 yuan and pounds) were issued, and in 1942, so-called "Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bonds" were issued, all of which were actually inflation. Because most of these public bonds were directly given to pseudo-banks as "guaranteed reserves" and a large number of banknotes were issued, they were not used to tighten currency. Therefore, the more public bonds, the more inflation, and the more price fluctuations, which harmed the broad masses of people. Not only that, the four major families not only made a fortune in inflation, but also gained great benefits from the preferential discounts on public bonds, increasing their exploitation of the people. And the funds for repaying the principal and interest of these public bonds were entirely the blood and sweat of the broad masses of people.

    Due to the different purposes of issuing public bonds, the People's Government is very considerate in protecting the interests of bond purchasers. First of all, it stipulates that physical objects are used as the standard of calculation, and interest is also calculated according to physical objects. This prevents bondholders from being affected by changes in currency value that would impact the original value of the principal and interest of the public bonds. And it stipulates that they will be fully repaid in five years. As stated in the instructions of the State Council on December 30, 1949: "Equivalent to fixed-term savings." Issuing this kind of parity and principal-protected public bond, which is equivalent to "fixed-term savings," can only be done by the people's own regime.

    Now, the first lottery for the redemption of principal on the People's Victory Parity Bonds has been realized. This is sufficient proof that the People's Government is responsible, efficient, and consistent in its words and deeds. In order to take care of the interests of bondholders, the Central People's Government has also made reasonable provisions in the measures for the redemption of principal and interest on the People's Victory Parity Bonds, such as the date and method of lottery redemption, payment, conversion, and exemption from interest income tax. First of all, the deadline for payment of principal and interest has been relaxed. The original regulations for these parity bonds, from 1951 to 1955, stipulated that the payment of principal and interest should begin on March 31st of each year. In order to prevent bondholders from suffering losses due to inconvenience in payment, it is specifically stipulated that the lottery will be held 60 days before the start of each year's principal and interest payment, i.e., February 1st of each year, and the payment date will be extended to September 30th. All principal and interest that should have been paid this time but were not collected can be extended to the next payment period until September 30, 1955. If the principal and interest have not been paid in any of the periods, they can be extended to March 31, 1956. Secondly, the lottery method is fair and reasonable. The serial numbers of these parity bonds issued this time are one hundred consecutive numbers each, and the last two digits must be from "01" to "00". Therefore, each number represents one percent of the parity bonds issued, and each number represents the bonds with the same last two digits of the number. When conducting the lottery, according to this rule, one hundred lottery tickets from "01" to "00" were made and placed in ten lottery tubes in sequence for the lottery. This time, 10% of the principal will be redeemed, that is, one lottery ticket will be drawn in each tube, so that all ten groups of numbers will have the opportunity to win. This method can achieve fairness and rationality in determining the order of repayment. Thirdly, it is also stipulated that interest income tax will be exempted, the principal and interest of bonds will be collected and paid on behalf of others, and postage and remittance fees will be exempted.

    The people's country cares for the people in all aspects. The people should also care for their own country in all aspects. All bondholders who have won the lottery for the redemption of principal and interest should use the principal and interest they have received for legitimate causes, and the industrial and commercial sectors should invest the principal and interest they have obtained in production undertakings. At the symposium of the directors of the 99 industry associations under the auspices of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, it was unanimously agreed that the principal and interest of the bonds won in the lottery should be invested in production undertakings through investment companies. The Federation of Industry and Commerce has issued a call, calling on the city's industrial and commercial sectors to invest the principal and interest of the bonds paid out in the investment company on a voluntary basis. This is a manifestation of patriotism, and it should be promoted in various places in the industrial and commercial sectors.

　　从公债还本付息来看我们人民的国家
    萧银才
    一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债的首次还本抽签，已于一日在人民首都公开举行，所有这次中签债券的本金和这次到期的利息，都在三月三十一日起由各地人民银行兑付。一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债一万万分，从一九五○年一月五日开始发行，至三月下旬，不到三个月的时间，已经基本上胜利完成了推销任务，有的地区且有超过。海外侨胞对购买公债甚为积极，这均表现了全国人民和海外侨胞的爱国主义的精神。各地在推销公债的过程中，曾发生一些缺点，以后也都改正了。这次人民胜利折实公债的发行，对于紧缩通货、弥补财政赤字、帮助金融物价的稳定上，是起了重要作用的。
    一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债发行及其胜利完成，以及此次按期实行抽签还本付息，也从这一个方面反映了中国人民民主政权的优越性。这个优越性表现在发行公债是完全为了人民的利益，而又依靠与领导人民来完成这一任务；表现在这个政府是中国历史上最负责和最有效能的政府。
    在发行公债一年之后来回顾公债发行的经过，更可以清楚地看到中央人民政府发行人民胜利折实公债之目的，完全是为了人民。因为一九四九年冬和一九五○年初，国家财政还未平衡，金融物价还未稳定，一九五○年国家的财政收支状况是尚有赤字百分之十八点七，人民政府为了避免通货膨胀，以保护人民的利益，因而决定发行占国家支出百分之七点二的二万万分公债，其后又为照顾人民的经济能力，仅发行了一万万分。中央人民政府政务院陈云副总理于一九四九年十二月二日，对于物价问题与发行公债的报告中，曾经指出：“这种公债的作用，在于弥补财政赤字的一部分，人民购买公债，在全国经济困难情况下，也是一种负担。但是这种负担，比起因增发钞票，币价下跌所受的损失说来，是比较好的。因为币价下跌的结果，其下跌部分的币值，是全部损失了的，购买了的公债，在一时算来是负担，但是究竟可以还本付息，不是一种损失。如果发行公债缩小赤字的结果，使明年的币值与物价情况比今年改善，则非但对全国工资生活的劳动人民，和军政公教人员有好处，而且，对于工商业的正常经营，也是有益的。所以从全体人民的利益说来，发行公债比之多发钞票要好些。”事实证明：折实公债的发行，对于停止通货膨胀，以稳定金融物价这一问题上，是收到明显的效果的。当时，发行公债还有另外一种与此相反的目的，和一种与此相反的方法，那就是中国人民十分熟悉和十分痛恨的国民党政府所实行的公债政策。国民党反动派所滥发的公债，在它统治中国的二十余年中，共达六十余种，其目的，不但在政治上是为了残害人民，在经济上也是对人民实行掠夺的。一九三八年发行了“金公债”（万元、英镑票额的公债），一九四○年发行了所谓“建设金公债”（也是万元、英镑票额的公债），一九四二年发行了所谓“同盟胜利美金公债”实际上都是通货膨胀。因为这些公债大多是直接交给伪四行作为“保证准备”而大量发行钞票，不是用来紧缩通货。因此，公债愈多，通货也愈膨胀，物价更波动，这就为害了广大人民。不仅如此，四大家族不但在通货膨胀中发财，而且在公债的优厚的折扣上得了极大的利益，加重其对于人民的剥削。而这些公债偿还本息的款项，却完全是广大人民的血汗。
    由于发行公债的目的不同，人民政府对于保障购买公债人的利益是十分周到的。首先就是规定了以实物为计算的标准，利息也是照实物计算。这就使持有债券人不致因币值变动而影响到公债本息的原来价值。而且规定了分五年完全偿还。正如政务院一九四九年十二月三十日的指示所说：“等于定期储蓄。”发行这种相当于“定期储蓄”的折实保本公债，是只有人民自己的政权才能办得到的。
    现在，人民胜利折实公债的首次抽签还本，已经实现了。这足以证明人民政府是负责任、有效率、言行一致的。中央人民政府为了照顾债券持有人的利益，又在人民胜利折实公债还本付息办法中，又在抽签还本，以及付息的日期、方法、兑付、转兑和免征利息所得税等项中，作了合理的规定。首先是放宽了兑付本息的期限。这次折实公债自一九五一年起至一九五五年止，原规定为每年三月三十一日开始兑付本息。为了使持有债券人不致因兑付不便而蒙受损失，特规定每年于还本付息开始前六十天，即每年二月一日，举行抽签，并将兑付日期延长至九月三十日止。凡是本次应兑未取的本息，还能展延到下期兑付期内领取，至一九五五年九月三十日止。如果各次本息都没有兑取的，能再延长到一九五六年三月三十一日。其次，抽签方法公平合理。这次发行的折实公债号码，每一百张连号，其末尾两字一定是从“○一”到“○○”。因此，每一号就代表了发行的折实公债的百分之一，每一号就代表了号码末尾两字相同的债券。抽中的号码，无论债券面额大小，只要是末尾两字相同，都是中签。执行抽签时，依此规律，制定了由“○一”到“○○”的一百支签，分装在十个签筒里面，依次抽签。这次还本百分之十，即在每筒抽签一支，使十组号码都能有中签的机会。这种办法，对于确定偿还次序的先后，自能达到公平和合理。第三，并规定了免纳利息所得税、代收代付债券本息、以及免收邮费和汇费等。
    人民的国家，在一切方面都爱护人民。人民也就应当从一切方面爱护自己的国家。一切中签还本付息的债券持有人，应当把所兑取的公债本息用到正当的事业上去，工商界更应将所得本息投资于生产事业。天津市工商联合会主持的九十九个行业公会的主任委员的座谈会上，已一致赞成将中签公债的本息，通过投资公司，投向生产事业。工商联合会已发出号召，号召全市工商界在自愿原则下，将所兑付的公债本息投入投资公司。这正是爱国精神的表现，各地工商界应加以推广。
