Introducing Primary Schools Run by the Government with Private Assistance
    Li Yang, Lang Jiehua
    (1) Why Implement Government-Run with Private Assistance?
    After the land reform, the economic lives of peasants have generally improved, and the enthusiasm for learning culture has been increasing day by day. According to recent statistics, the six provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and Rehe in Northeast China, and the suburbs of Shenyang City, have a total of 2,858 village schools run by peasants, with 200,568 students. In the four counties of Daixian, Ningwu, Yangqu, and Jingle in Shanxi, the masses have self-organized 141 schools with 2,410 students. Shuoxian County in Chahar Province has 87 private primary schools. Huanggang, Hubei has 1,200 private schools (student numbers missing); Wuchang has 155 in twelve townships, with 2,179 students; Xiangyang Prefecture increased 1,388 publicly-aided private primary schools in the first half of 1950, with 65,926 students. In Taian, Shandong, Xintian, Hunan, Anhui, Pingyuan, southern Anhui, and other places, there are also primary schools run by the masses.
    This shows that the broad masses of the people urgently demand that their children be able to attend schools. If we cannot meet their demands, we will surely become detached from the masses. Therefore, government-run with private assistance is worth vigorously promoting everywhere.
    On the other hand, China's current financial situation is still relatively difficult, and it is not possible to universally and substantially establish schools to meet the demands of the broad masses of the people. Implementing government-run with private assistance can rely on the masses to solve the problem of financial difficulties and guarantee the livelihood of teachers. Generally speaking, rural primary schools can charge students a little tuition. Junior primary schools should charge no more than five catties of rice per person per semester, and senior primary schools should charge no more than ten catties of rice per person per semester. However, poor students may be exempted from tuition with the consent of the village government. But we must strictly prevent forced orders and apportionments.
    The results of experiments in Wutai and Yuci in Shanxi, and Chahar Province have proved that this method is good and feasible.
    (2) How to Carry Out This Work?
    First, run the schools well. The work experience of Wutai, Yuci, and Yuxian has proved that the main key to implementing government-run with private assistance is to run the schools well. Because only in this way will the masses voluntarily contribute rice and money to help the schools. For example, Comrade Zhou Yuan, a teacher in Liuhekou, Yuxian, teaches well, and the masses automatically solved his difficulties in life. But it must be pointed out that the purpose of government-run with private assistance is by no means simply to relieve teachers, but to run schools well and teach students well.
    Second, visit parents, solicit their opinions on the school as much as possible, and explain to them the significance of government-run with private assistance to nurture ideas. Teachers should humbly accept everyone's opinions and strive to correct their shortcomings. If the school is run well, the parents will be more satisfied.
    Third, get the cadres and teachers to understand. Because some cadres and teachers do not have a sufficient understanding of this issue in their thinking, and even have resistance to it. For example, some cadres think, what can teachers do? Why give them a raise? What about the teachers? They are afraid it won't work; afraid that students won't be able to pay for the rice and won't come to school; afraid that the amount of rice paid will be too little to solve the problem. Therefore, everyone hopes that the government will increase their salaries and not rely on the masses to solve the problem. This is all because they do not believe in the masses and underestimate the power of the masses.
    Fourth, we can carry out mobilization and persuasion work through the People's Congress to arouse everyone's attention to this issue. Because the People's Congress is the organ of public opinion of the people of the whole village, and the representatives are all people with prestige among the masses.
    Finally, set up a parents' committee. The experimental work in Wutai, Yuci, and Yuxian counties has proved that the parents' committee is the best organizational form for improving schools, closely linking schools and parents, and it is also the action agency for government-run with private assistance. The parents' committee can play a great role in mobilizing the masses to contribute rice and persuading some backward parents. It can also play a significant role in helping teachers improve their teaching. The parents' committee should generally consist of three to five people (larger villages can increase to seven to nine people), and select an active parent as the chairman. The regular work of the parents' committee is generally to: reflect parents' opinions on the school; participate in relevant meetings such as school affairs meetings and teaching meetings; convey the school's opinions to the parents; frequently mobilize children to enroll; and mobilize parents to pay tuition.
    (3) The Benefits of Government-Run with Private Assistance
    Government-run with private assistance can appropriately improve the treatment of teachers and stabilize their work morale. In the experiment in three different types of villages in Wutai County, junior primary schools charge five catties of rice per person per semester, with reductions or exemptions for the poor. This increases each teacher's income by 24 to 42 catties of millet per month. In Yuci County, each teacher's income increased by an average of 50 catties of millet per month. Teachers in Xixinzhuang, Yuxian, can receive a subsidy of 40 catties of rice per month, and the village allocates eight mu of public land to the school (cultivated by the village on behalf of the school).
    Government-run with private assistance can change teachers' teaching attitudes and improve their work enthusiasm. Due to the lack of effort of teacher Duan Chunlai at Nansangquan Reincarnation Primary School in Wutai County, only one student remained, and the masses were very dissatisfied with him. Later, he heard that Hugancun had implemented government-run with private assistance, and he felt very uncomfortable. He was determined to run the school well. Through his efforts, the number of enrolled children increased to ten, and he promoted the villagers to run private schools.
    Government-run with private assistance can improve the relationship between the masses and the school, so that everyone regards running the school as their own business. The parents in Dajian'an Village, Wutai, said, "The comrades in the work team helped us run the school well, it really is a good thing for us!" After her daughter's school improved, Xu Xianfu's daughter studied harder. Her mother boasted about him everywhere.
    Government-run with private assistance has been successfully tested in three places. We must promote it so that it can achieve greater development in the vast rural areas.

　　介绍实行公办民助的小学
    李扬  郎洁华
    （一）为什么要实行公办民助？
    土地改革以后，农民经济生活普遍上升，要求学习文化的热潮日益高涨。据最近统计，东北的辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江、热河等六省和沈阳市郊共有农民兴办的村学二千八百五十八所，学生二十万零五千六百八十六名。山西代县、宁武、阳曲、静乐等四县群众自办的学校有一百四十一所，学生二千四百零十人。察哈尔省朔县有民办小学八十七所。湖北黄冈有民办学校一千二百所（缺学生人数）；武昌十二个乡镇有一百五十五所，学生二千一百七十九人；襄阳专署一九五○年上半年增加了民办公助小学一千三百八十八所，学生六万五千九百二十六人。山东泰安、湖南新田、安徽、平原、皖南等地，都有群众自办的小学。
    这说明了广大的人民迫切要求他们的子女能够进入学校读书，如果我们不能满足他们的要求，我们就一定会脱离群众。因此，公办民助是值得各地大力提倡的。
    另一方面，目前中国的财政情况还比较困难，还不可能普遍、大量地设立学校，来满足广大人民的要求。实行公办民助，就可以依靠群众，解决经费困难问题，并保证教师的生活。一般地说，乡村小学可向学生收一点学费，初小每期每人最多不超过五斤米，高小每期每人最多不超过十斤米，但贫苦学生，经村政府同意，得免收学费。但我们必须严格防止强迫命令和摊派的现象。
    山西五台、榆次及察哈尔省的试验结果，证明了这一办法是好的、行得通的。
    （二）怎样进行这一工作？
    首先要办好学校。五台、榆次、蔚县的工作经验证明，要实行公办民助，主要关键是办好学校。因为只有这样群众才会自愿地出米出钱帮助学校。如蔚县柳河口教师周元同志教书教得好，群众自动给他解决了生活上的困难问题。但必须指出，公办民助的目的决不是单纯的救济教师，而是为了办好学校、教好学生。
    其次，要访问家长，多多征求他们对学校的意见，并向他们说明公办民助的意义，进行酝酿。教师应虚心的接受大家的意见，努力改正缺点。学校办好了，家长也就更满意了。
    再次，要搞通干部和教员的思想。因为某些干部和教师在思想上对这个问题认识不足，甚至有抗拒思想。如有的干部认为，教师会干啥？为什么要加薪？教师方面呢？怕行不通；怕学生缴不起米不来上学；怕缴的米少解决不了问题。因此，大家都希望政府加薪，不去依靠群众来解决问题。这都是由于他们不相信群众，低估了群众的力量的缘故。
    第四，我们可以通过人民代表会来做动员说服工作，引起大家对这个问题的重视。因为人代会是全村人民的民意机关，而代表们又都是在群众中有威信的人物。
    最后是成立家长委员会。五台、榆次、蔚县三县的试验工作证明，家长委员会是改进学校、使学校和家长密切结合起来的最好的组织形式，也是公办民助的行动机构。家长委员会在发动群众出米、说服部分落后家长上，能起很大的作用。在帮助教师改进教学上也能起不小的作用。家长委员会一般以三人至五人为宜（较大的村庄可增加至七人到九人），选一积极的家长任主任委员。家长委员会的经常工作一般是：反映家长对学校的意见；参加有关的会议如校务会议和教导会议；向各家长传达学校的意见；经常动员儿童入学；动员家长出学费。
    （三）公办民助的好处
    公办民助，可以适当的提高教师的待遇，安定教师的工作情绪。五台县三个不同类型的村庄，在试验中，初小每期每人收学米五斤，贫穷的减免。这使每个教师每月增加二十四斤到四十二斤小米的收入。榆次县每个教师每月平均增加五十斤小米。蔚县西辛庄教师，每月可得到补助米四十斤，并由村中给学校拨了公田八亩（由村中代耕）。
    公办民助，可以转变教师的教学态度，提高教师的工作热情。五台县南桑泉轮回小学由于教师段春来工作不努力，只剩下了一个学生，群众对他都很不满意。后来他听到虎汉村实行了公办民助，心里很难受，决心要把学校办好。经过他的努力，入学儿童增至十名，并推动全村的老乡来办民校。
    公办民助，可以改进群众与学校的关系，使大家把办学当做自己的事情。五台大建安村家长们都说：“工作组同志帮助我们把学校办好，真是给我们办了一件好事！”老乡徐先福的女儿，在学校办好之后，读书更努力了。她的母亲就到处夸耀他。
    公办民助已在三个地方试验成功了。我们要加以提倡，使它在广大的农村中得到更大的发展。
