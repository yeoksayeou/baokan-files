    New Year Pictures and Broadcast Songs Should Have Explanations

    To the drafters and publishers of New Year pictures, I have a request: that necessary textual explanations be added beneath each New Year picture. Currently, only a few words are marked below or above the New Year pictures, which often fails to allow people to fully understand the content of the picture. A picture depicting the lives of the masses in area A may not be understood by the masses in area B. A picture depicting the lives of one group of masses may not be understood by another group of masses. For example, a picture titled "Chairman Mao is Coming" should briefly explain that this depicts the scene in January 1950 when Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, returning from the Soviet Union, visited a station in Northeast China and were welcomed by the workers. Similarly, a picture titled "Minority Nationalities Present Gifts to Chairman Mao" should specify when and where this event took place, which nationalities and individuals presented the gifts, and who else was with Chairman Mao to receive them. A painting published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, attributed to Huang Jun, doesn't even have a title; only the slogan "Learn from the Mao Zedong Locomotive" and "We must strive for model worker innovations and new plans" (this sentence is grammatically awkward) is written in the picture. Such a painting, I fear, would be difficult for anyone in rural areas to understand. I also believe that good paintings should not rely on "inscriptions" to exist, but New Year pictures and some story paintings, propaganda posters, and caricatures seem to be exceptions. Furthermore, this kind of explanation is different from the inscriptions of old Chinese paintings; it does not hinder the independence of the painting but is merely an additional popular explanation for a painting that already has an independent standing. Without this explanation, the masses will not easily fully understand the meaning of the painting, and the popular educational effect of the painting will be greatly diminished. Therefore, I suggest that each New Year picture should have a simple explanation.

    In addition, I also suggest that radio stations, when broadcasting songs, should read the lyrics aloud before broadcasting the song in order to make it easier for listeners to understand the lyrics. The reason is similar to what I said above about New Year pictures. Understanding the lyrics makes listening more interesting and facilitates the popularization of the song. When broadcasting operas, in addition to reciting the lyrics, a brief explanation of the plot can also be provided. Of course, there is no need for this procedure for lyrics that listeners are most familiar with and that are most clearly pronounced, but I think this is necessary in most cases.

    Editor's Note: Starting with this issue, we have decided to add a "Reader's Letters" column to this publication to publish readers' various criticisms, suggestions, and inquiries regarding current literary and artistic work. These letters will be answered either by this publication or by someone specially invited by this publication to answer them.

    A reader's letter published in this issue raises a very important issue for the literary and artistic circles, namely, opposing the naturalistic (anti-idealistic) tendency in literary and artistic criticism, and the tendency of formalism that starts from concepts and does not recognize the integrity of works of art. This kind of incorrect criticism often destroys the political power of works under the pretext of political reasons. We hope that this sharp criticism can arouse widespread discussion and concrete results.

    Comrade Wang Huadong's letter is to be answered separately by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Press and Publications Administration Broadcasting Bureau.

### 年画和广播歌曲要有说明

专栏：读者来信

    年画和广播歌曲要有说明编辑同志：
    对于新年画的绘制者和出版者，我有一个要求，就是在每一幅年画下面加上必要的文字说明。现在年画的下面或上面，只标着几个字，常常不能使人领会画的全部内容。描写甲地群众生活的画，乙地群众不一定能看懂。描写这部分群众生活的画，另一部分群众也不一定能看懂。例如题着“毛主席来了”的一幅画，就应该简单地说明这是一九五○年一月毛主席同周总理从苏联回来在东北一个车站参观受到工人们欢迎的情形。又如题为“少数民族向毛主席献礼”的一幅，应该写明这是什么时候什么地方的事，献礼的是些什么民族的什么人，和毛主席在一起受礼的又是些什么人。人民美术出版社出版的有一幅署名黄均的画，连题目也没有，只在画里的标语上写着“向毛泽东号看齐”，“我们要争取劳模发明新计划”（这句话文理欠通）。这样一幅画，在农村中怕很难有人知道是怎么回事。我也相信好的绘画本不应该依赖“题词”而存在，但一来年画和有些故事画宣传画讽刺画似乎又当别论，二来这种说明也与旧时中国画的题词的作用不同，它并不妨害绘画的独立性，而只是对于具有独立地位的绘画的一种外加的通俗解说。没有这种解说，群众就不容易完全领会画的意思，画的通俗教育作用也就大受损失了。因此我建议在每幅年画上要有简单的说明。
    此外，我还建议广播电台广播歌曲时，为了使听众听懂歌词，在广播之前把词念一遍。理由和上面关于年画所说的差不多。懂得了歌词，听起来才有意思，而且才便于歌曲的普及。广播戏曲时除了念词，还可以简单地说明情节。当然听众最熟悉的和字音最明了的歌词无须费这道手续，但是我想在多数的情形下这是需要的。

    编者按：从本期起，我们决定在本刊添设读者来信一栏，发表读者对于当前文艺工作的各种批评、建议和询问。这些来信，或者由本刊答复，或者由本刊请专人答复。
    本期所发表的一读者的来信，向文艺界提出了一个十分重要的问题，即反对文艺批评中的自然主义（反理想主义）倾向，从概念出发和不承认艺术品的完整性的公式主义倾向。这种不正确的批评往往借口政治理由而破坏了作品的政治力量。我们希望这个尖锐的指摘能够引起广泛的讨论和确实的结果。
    王化东同志的来信，请人民美术出版社和新闻总署广播事业局分别答复。
