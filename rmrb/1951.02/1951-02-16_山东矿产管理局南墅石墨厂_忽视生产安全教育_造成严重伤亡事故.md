　　Shandong Mining Bureau Nanshu Graphite Factory
　  Disregards Production Safety Education
　  Causing Serious Casualties
    Editor:
    The leading cadres of the Nanshu Graphite Factory of the Shandong Mining Bureau neglect safety in production, and the facilities for protecting the lives of workers are very inadequate, resulting in continuous casualties.
    In August of last year, a wheel on the factory's grinding mill was placed in the wrong position during repairs. The leading cadres of the factory failed to detect this. After starting the machine, the belt was put on but soon fell off. The worker watching the mill, Feng Jifu, went to hang the belt, and his sleeve was caught in the belt, resulting in his right arm being broken. After the accident, the cadres were still apathetic, did not learn from this lesson, and did not educate the workers or improve the equipment in a timely manner. As a result, another casualty accident occurred on January 8 this year: The belt guide wheel of the grinding mill was covered with wet ore sand and froze, causing the belt to become too large and fall off several times. The management cadres did not seriously find the cause, and carelessly believed that the belt was loose, so they took the belt down and chopped off more than an inch. After it was reconnected, the worker Deng Jisheng was caught in the belt when he went to hang it and died on the spot.
    The continuous occurrence of these tragic casualties shows that the factory's leading cadres do not conduct thorough inspections of the machine's equipment conditions on a regular basis, and cannot detect many problems in a timely manner, and use this to guide and improve workers' operating skills to prevent accidents. At the same time, the factory's safety production education for employees is very inadequate on weekdays. The instructions and circulars on safety production issued by higher authorities are rarely used to organize employees to discuss and study for a certain period of time. There are many belts in the workshop, but the workers do not understand the common sense of how to hang the belts, and accidents are of course easy to occur. At present, the factory's leading cadres have made a review of this in addition to requesting disciplinary action from the higher authorities.

### 山东矿产管理局南墅石墨厂  忽视生产安全教育  造成严重伤亡事故

　　山东矿产管理局南墅石墨厂
  　忽视生产安全教育
　  造成严重伤亡事故
    编辑同志：
    山东矿产管理局南墅石墨厂领导干部忽视安全生产工作，对有关保护职工生命安全的设施做的很不够，以致连续发生伤亡事故。
    去年八月间，该厂碾子粉碎机上有一个轮子在修理时放错了位置，该厂领导干部没有检查出来，开车后，皮带挂上去不久又掉下来；看碾磨机工人封吉福，上去挂皮带时，衣袖被皮带卷进去，结果将右胳膊卷断。事故发生后，干部对此仍麻木不仁，没有记取这一教训，及时向工人进行教育和改进设备。结果在今年一月八日又发生了伤亡事故：碾磨机的皮带诱导轮，沾了湿矿砂上冻，皮带?大，连续掉下数次。管理干部并没有认真找出原因，粗枝大叶地认为是皮带松，将皮带拿下来剁去一英寸多长。接好后，工人邓吉生上去挂时，被皮带卷进去，当场身亡。
    连续发生这些惨痛的伤亡事故，说明工厂的领导干部平日对机器的设备情况检查不深入，对许多问题不能及时发觉，并以此来指导提高工人的操作技术，防止事故发生。同时该厂平日对职工的安全生产教育非常不够，上级发下的关于安全生产的指示及通令等，很少拿出一定时间来组织职工讨论、学习。工作间里皮带很多，但工人对怎样挂皮带的常识都不了解，事故当然就容易产生。现该厂领导干部对此除作检讨外，已呈请上级给予处分。
