　　The Annihilation of the "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion"
　　Li Zhuang Chao Qi
　　Let those British parliamentarians argue to their hearts' content in Parliament! The "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion" of the 29th Brigade of the British Commonwealth, which Attlee sent to Korea as an accomplice to the U.S. military, was annihilated by our Chinese People's Volunteer Army; this is the inevitable end for all invaders and accomplices.

　　After the U.S. military's "38th Parallel Defense Line" was breached by our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, the U.S. military in Seoul fled south in disarray. In order to save their own lives, the U.S. military ordered the rifle regiment of the 29th Brigade of the British Commonwealth and the "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion" to provide cover in Uijeongbu. On January 2nd, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army received the order to "attack and advance towards Goyang." Goyang is located on the highway from Uijeongbu to Seoul, sixty miles from each. Occupying Goyang would allow the Volunteer Army to strike the flanks and rear of Seoul and cut off the British army's retreat from Uijeongbu.
　　Two miles north of Goyang is a small village called Byeokje-ri, which was guarded by a battalion of the 34th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Division. Two companies of a unit of the Volunteer Army launched a fierce attack on Byeokje-ri, capturing 28 U.S. soldiers in twenty minutes of fighting. The remaining enemy, abandoning the British, fled back to Seoul. As a result, the British accomplice army, which had been sent by the U.S. commander to Uijeongbu to provide cover for the retreat, was completely isolated and fell into the Volunteer Army's net.
　　After occupying Goyang, the Volunteer Army immediately launched an attack on the Sinyu-ri heights southeast of Goyang. The Sinyu-ri heights are located west of the Uijeongbu-Seoul highway, 200 meters high, and were entrenched by a British battalion, which was the only support for the British "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion." At dawn on the 3rd, two companies of a unit of the Volunteer Army launched a fierce attack on this high ground and completely occupied it in half an hour. The enemy fled so quickly that they did not even have time to remove the signal panels for liaison aircraft.
　　For the entire day of the 3rd, explosions shook the Sinyu-ri heights. More than a thousand British soldiers from Uijeongbu, in coordination with the British soldiers who had fled down from the heights, and with the support of more than two hundred artillery pieces, repeatedly counterattacked the heights. In order to seize the signal panels for liaison aircraft, the enemy launched five attacks, all of which were repelled by the soldiers of a certain company of the Volunteer Army guarding the heights. The only remaining military cadre in this company was a deputy platoon leader, who persisted until dark—persisted until victory.
　　The front lines of the Volunteer Army positions were littered with the corpses of British soldiers. The soldiers put on British helmets, took control of the signal panels for liaison aircraft, and directed American planes to bombard the British troops around the heights. The soldiers said, "Watching the enemy bomb the enemy is really the happiest thing."
　　The Volunteer Army knew that Britain did not have many heavy tank battalions; the British soldiers knew even better that they did not have many heavy tank battalions; therefore, the battle for the heights was exceptionally fierce and savage. As a result of the battle, we were victorious. All the important strongholds around Uijeongbu had been occupied by us; the fate of the "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion" had now been decided.
　  ×　    ×　      ×
　　Three infantry companies of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated a British heavy tank battalion, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 300 British soldiers, and capturing or destroying 31 tanks, 1 armored vehicle, and 24 tractors and trucks. The infantry companies used explosives, demolition charges, rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades to defeat heavy tanks equipped with 105mm howitzers.
　　The Fifth Company alone captured or destroyed 12 tanks and 1 armored vehicle in one night; in addition to those killed, they captured 32 British soldiers alive, including a major commander.
　　The soldiers of the Fifth Company came from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, Liaodong, and Henan, that is, from half of China. None of these soldiers had ever fought tanks before. "This thing, dark and ugly, makes weird noises, shoots cannons, and spits fire. At first, we were a little hesitant. But," the soldiers said, "when we thought that we were the Volunteer Army, volunteers representing all the Chinese people to help our Korean brothers fight the invaders, we became brave. With this courage, we can destroy any tank and defeat any invader!" This is the bold statement of the Chinese people. The soldiers' firm confidence and righteous spirit are a reliable guarantee for victory in the anti-aggression war.
　　On the night of the 3rd, these three companies launched a fierce attack on the tank battalion. At 10 p.m., the Fifth Company occupied the Boryeomijae position. Boryeomijae is located beside the highway between Uijeongbu and Seoul, south of the Sinyu-ri heights, seven miles northwest of Goyang and thirty miles southeast of Seoul. Boryeomijae is a small valley, with the Uijeongbu-Seoul highway running through it. The highway is about one meter above the ground, and the sides of the road are vertical, so tanks cannot cross the road horizontally. To the east of the highway are mountains, and to the west are hills. There is a river ditch running east-west, and the highway crosses it via a bridge. Now the bridge has been destroyed. Boryeomijae is located near the bridge, and it is a small village.
　　The Fifth Company deployed three platoons along the highway, forming a front of 150 meters wide, concentrating firepower near the bridge. That night, the area around Boryeomijae was earth-shattering. The destroyed tanks emitted raging fires, and the flares dropped by enemy planes hung in the air, illuminating the battlefield as bright as day. The flamethrowers of the enemy tanks spewed out blood-red flames, and the star shells drew long lines of various colors. The Volunteer Army's explosive packs and hand grenades burst out with dazzling sparks, and the red lines of fire from machine guns spun around the tanks. Amidst the bursts of explosives and demolition charges, in the midst of the bugle calls, shouts of killing, and English slogans calling on the enemy to surrender, the enemy surrendered one after another.
　　At 10:20 p.m. that night, a British armored anti-tank vehicle came from the north. Soldier Wang Xinyuan set up his machine gun on the left side of the bridge, five or six meters from the highway, let the anti-tank vehicle pass the front, and concentrated his fire on the side of the vehicle. The anti-tank vehicle panicked, turned sharply, and plunged down the highway. The gun barrel on the vehicle crashed into a haystack beside the road, making it impossible to move forward or backward. The enemy fired various light weapons at the Volunteer Army, but they were immediately suppressed by the Volunteer Army's machine gun fire. The infantry advanced rapidly towards the enemy from all directions. Under the starlight, the bayonets gleamed. Soldier Li Weijing thought, "I've learned the slogans for persuading surrender, I don't know if they'll work, I'll try it today." So he shouted loudly at the enemy: "Ha Hallo! don't act! (Hey, don't move!)" "Lift! hands! (Hands up!)" The enemy was very obedient, and four people raised their hands almost at the same time, one of whom was a major commander.
　　Five minutes later, three tanks came from the north. The tanks crawled hesitantly and slowly like snails. The star shells on the first tank were fired so that the sky was completely red, and the second and third tanks were spitting out blood-red flames. They seemed very fierce, but on this night battlefield, they could not exert any of their power. They dared not turn on the lights, and could not see anything; their drivers were dazed by the motor noise and could not hear anything. The Volunteer Army soldiers said: "They are both deaf and blind." When they encountered the fearless Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they immediately turned into "bears."
　　Soldier Liu Fengqi was the first to climb up and stuff an explosive pack into the tracks of the first tank, but the explosive did not go off. Yang Houzhao, to the right of Liu Fengqi, was the second to climb up and put a demolition charge on the tracks of the tank, but it also did not detonate. Seeing that the enemy was about to run away, machine gun squad deputy leader Li Guanglu put down his machine gun, picked up two demolition charges, ran up to the third tank, and stuffed the demolition charges between the tracks. With a loud bang, the tank jumped and then stopped moving. Zhou Shijie and Chen Zijie successively destroyed the remaining two tanks, and the first battle ended victoriously, with no casualties for the Volunteer Army.
　　Five minutes later, three more tanks came. Third platoon deputy Chen Chungui, carrying four hand grenades, went around to the left side of the first tank, grabbed the iron railing on the tracks with his hand, and agilely jumped onto the protective plate. He felt a small hole of about twenty centimeters on the top cover, saw a faint light leaking out from inside, and heard the enemy talking inside. Chen Chungui was so happy that he broke out in a sweat, and quickly stuffed in two hand grenades. The tank exploded from the inside, and flames rose more than two zhang high. Li Guanglu successfully destroyed the second one. Peng Deyu's encounter was not so smooth, and he fought with the third tank for a long time.
　　At this time, several enemy planes were flying low and circling in the sky over the battlefield. The bombs and machine guns hit more than two hundred meters away from the soldiers, which was not a threat; it was just that the continuous flares were really annoying. Peng Deyu disregarded everything, rushed to the front of the third tank, and tried to stuff a demolition charge into the middle of the tracks. The tank was moving, and it was impossible to stuff it in for a while. The enemy on the tank discovered Peng Deyu, and suddenly a person emerged from the turret and shot at him with a revolver. Peng Deyu found that his buttocks were on fire and his neck was numb. When he touched it with his hand, it was sticky, and it turned out that he had been grazed. "My mission is not yet complete," he thought, and gritted his teeth and cursed: "To hell with it, it's you die or I live!" He mustered his energy to chase the tank, chased it for more than ten meters, and used all his strength to stuff the demolition charge into the middle of the tracks. A ball of fire rose before his eyes, and he heard a huge explosion, and the tank was destroyed. He cursed fiercely for the last time, dragged his wounded body, and returned victoriously to his position.
　　The battlefield was now white-hot. Everywhere was flames, everywhere was the sound of shooting and explosions. The enemy discovered that this was the main position of the Volunteer Army, and most of the people sat outside the tanks, concentrating all kinds of firepower and shooting at the Volunteer Army soldiers. The Fifth Company reorganized its firepower, concentrated all its machine guns, and attacked the enemy outside the tanks, first sweeping them away. Grenadiers calmly climbed onto the tanks, tapped on the turrets with hand grenades, and shouted loudly for the enemy to surrender. This group of enemies was very obedient, and the turret opened slightly, first two hands came out, and then a head. The soldiers struggled to pull these British soldiers out. They were already scared silly, and the hands they raised never came down. If you didn't pull him, he couldn't get out by himself. After the British soldiers, a foreign dog crawled out of the third tank. The foreign dog dragged its tail and also seemed weak. What did this British dog come to Korea for? The British soldiers seemed to regard fighting as a pleasant game, a pleasant trip. They were wrong. 1951 was not 1840, the era of imperialist rampage had long passed.
　　The enemy on the last three tanks had tried to make a desperate struggle. They blindly fired in all directions with all their firepower. Howitzers, heavy machine guns, carbines, pistols, and flamethrowers formed a tight network of fire around the tanks. Chen Chungui climbed to within five or six meters of the first tank and threw a hand grenade, and the enemies on the protective plate immediately fell to the ground in disarray. Chen Chungui immediately jumped onto the tank and tapped the turret with a hand grenade. Within a minute, the enemy did not move at all, which meant that they did not want to surrender. Chen Chungui very skillfully found the small hole on the top cover and stuffed in two hand grenades. The tank was blown up half a foot high, almost knocking him down. Li Weijing climbed to the side of another tank, first clearing the enemy on the protective plate with hand grenades, and then he was about to climb up. Suddenly, an enemy poked his head out of the turret and shot at him with a carbine. Li Weijing grabbed the gun body and pulled hard. The enemy suddenly let go, and the tank took the opportunity to start, but this tank was not able to escape either. It ran less than a hundred meters before being destroyed by friendly forces.
　  ×　    ×　    ×
　　The battle of Boryeomijae ended victoriously. Our soldiers had "gotten to the bottom of it." Li Guanglu said: "We used the battle of Boryeomijae to tell the imperialists that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with!" Indeed, the fate of these British tanks will also be the fate of the American warmongers. The battle of Boryeomijae also told the invading soldiers still on the Korean battlefield: they should learn from the British soldiers on the eighth, ninth, and tenth tanks; raising their hands to surrender is the only way to survive. Don't learn from the fools on the other tanks; blind resistance will surely lead to death.

　　“皇家重坦克营”的覆灭
　　李庄　超祺
    让那些英国议员们在议会中尽情地争吵吧！艾德礼送到朝鲜做美军的帮凶的“大英联邦二十九旅皇家重坦克营”，是被我国人民志愿军歼灭了；这是一切侵略者和帮凶者必然的下场。
　  ×　      ×　      ×
    美军“三八防线”被我国志愿军和朝鲜人民军突破之后，汉城美军就狼狈南逃。美军为了自己逃命，命令英联邦二十九旅来复枪团和“皇家重坦克营”在议政府担任掩护。一月二日，中国人民志愿军某部接到了“向高阳攻击前进”的命令。高阳就在议政府到汉城的公路线上，距两地各六十里。志愿军占领高阳，既可拊汉城侧背，又可断议政府英军退路。
    高阳以北二里处有一小村，名碧蹄里，由美军二十五师三十四团一个营据守。志愿军某部两个连猛攻碧蹄里，战二十分钟，俘美军二十八人，残敌丢下英军抱头窜回汉城。于是，被美军司令官派在议政府担任掩护撤退任务的英国帮凶军队就完全孤立，落入志愿军的天罗地网中了。
    志愿军占领高阳后，随即向高阳东南仙游里高地进攻。仙游里高地在议政府至汉城公路以西，高二百公尺，英军一营掘壕据守此地，这是英国“皇家重坦克营”的唯一后援。三日拂晓，志愿军某部两个连猛攻这个高地，半小时完全占领。敌人跑得如此之快，以致联络飞机的信号板都未及搬走。
    三日整整一天，爆炸声震撼仙游里高地。议政府英军千余人，配合从高地逃下去的英军，并用两百多门大炮配合，轮番向高地反扑。敌人为了抢夺联络飞机的信号板，发动了五次进攻，都被扼守高地的志愿军某连战士击退。这个连的军事干部最后只剩下一个副排长，仍然坚持到天黑，——坚持到胜利。
    志愿军阵地前沿，躺满英军的尸体。战士们戴上英军的钢盔，掌握着联络飞机的信号板，指挥美国飞机，猛炸高地周围的英军。战士们说：“眼看着敌人打敌人，真是顶高兴的事。”
    志愿军知道，英国并没有好多重坦克营；英国兵更知道，他们并没有好多重坦克营；因此，争夺高地的战斗表现得空前激烈与凶猛。战斗的结果，我们胜利了。议政府周围的重要据点都已被我们占领；“皇家重坦克营”的命运此时已被决定了。
　      ×　    ×　      ×
    中国人民志愿军某部三个步兵连，歼灭了英国一个重坦克营，毙伤俘英军三百余人，缴获、击毁坦克三十一辆、装甲车一辆、牵引车及汽车二十四辆。步兵连用炸药、爆破筒、步枪、机枪和手榴弹打败装有一○五榴弹炮的重坦克。
    只第五连一个连，一个晚上就缴获、击毁了坦克十二辆、装甲车一辆；除了打死者外，生俘英军少校队长以下三十二人。
    第五连的战士们，来自四川、云南、广东、广西、浙江、江西、湖北、山东、河北、辽东、河南，就是说，来自半个中国。这些战士过去都没有打过坦克。“这家伙，黑鸦鸦地，哇哇怪叫，又打炮，又喷火，开始心里都有些含糊。可是，”战士们说：“想到我们是志愿军，是代表全中国人民的志愿来帮助朝鲜弟兄们打击侵略者的，气就壮了。凭着这股气，我们可以击毁任何坦克，打败任何侵略者！”这是中国人民的豪语。战士们坚强的信心和浩然的正气，是反侵略战争胜利的可靠的保证。
    三日晚上，这三个连对坦克营发起了猛攻。夜十时，五连占领佛弥地阵地。佛弥地在议政府、汉城间的公路旁，在仙游里高地以南，西北距高阳七里，东南距汉城三十里。佛弥地附近是一个小小的谷地，议政府通汉城公路横贯其中，公路高出地面约一公尺，路侧壁直，坦克不能越路横行。公路东为大山、西为丘陵，东西有一河沟，公路架桥而过。现在桥已破坏了。佛弥地在桥的附近，是个小小的村庄。
    五连把三个排沿公路布置成一百五十公尺宽正面的阵地，火力集中桥的附近。这一夜，佛弥地附近惊天动地。被击毁的坦克发出熊熊大火，敌机投下的照明弹悬在空中，把战场照得明如白昼。敌军坦克的放射器喷出血红的火焰，星光弹划着各色的长线。志愿军的炸药包和手榴弹迸出耀眼的火花，机枪的红色火线围着坦克乱转。在炸药和爆破筒阵阵响声中，在冲锋号、喊杀声和召唤敌人投降的英语口号声中，敌人纷纷投降。
    当夜十时二十分，从北面开来一辆英军的装甲战防车。战士王新元把机枪架在桥的左侧、距公路五、六米处，让过战防车的正面，以集中连发向车侧猛烈射击。战防车慌了，猛一掉头，窜下公路，车上的炮身恰恰闯进路旁一个稻草堆中，一时进退不得。敌人以各种轻火器向志愿军射击，立刻被志愿军的机枪火力完全制伏。步兵从四面八方向敌人急进。在繁星照耀之下，刺刀闪闪发光。战士李为经想：“学过劝降的口号，不知道灵不灵，今天试试看。”他就大声向敌人叫起来：“Ha Hallo!don’t act!（喂，不要动！）”“Lift !hands!（举手！）”敌人非常听话，四个人几乎同一时间举起手来，其中有一个少校队长。
    五分钟后，由北面开来了三辆坦克。坦克像蜗牛一样犹豫而缓慢地爬着。第一辆坦克上的星光弹打得满天通红，第二、三辆喷着血红的火焰。样子似乎很凶，但是，在这夜间的战场上，它什么威风也施展不开了。它不敢开灯，什么也看不见；它的驾驶员被马达吵得发蒙，什么也听不见。志愿军战士们说：“它是又聋又瞎。”再遇到无畏的中国人民志愿军，立刻变成了“狗熊”。
    战士刘凤岐第一个爬上去，把炸药包塞到第一辆坦克的履带内，炸药没有响。在刘凤岐右侧的杨厚昭第二个爬上去，把爆破筒放在坦克的履带上，也没有炸着。眼看敌人要跑了。机枪班副班长李广录放下机枪，拿起两个爆破筒，跑步赶上第三辆坦克，把爆破筒塞到履带中间，轰然一声，坦克跳了一下，再也不动了。周士杰、陈子连接连炸毁了其余的两辆，首战胜利结束，志愿军无一伤亡。
    五分钟后，又来了三辆坦克。三排副陈春贵带着四颗手榴弹，绕到第一辆的左侧方，用手抓住履带上的铁栏杆，敏捷地跳到护板上。他摸到顶盖上有个二十公分左右的小孔，看见孔内漏出微光，听到敌人在里面哇啦哇啦地说话。陈春贵乐得出了一头汗，连忙塞进两个手榴弹，坦克从里面炸开，火焰腾起两丈多高。李广录顺利地炸毁第二辆。彭德玉的遭遇不够顺利，一个人和第三辆坦克打了好半天。
    这时候，几架敌机在战场上空低飞盘旋，炸弹、机枪打在战士们二百公尺以外，倒没有什么威胁；只是接二连三的照明弹，照得人实在讨厌。彭德玉不顾一切，冲到第三辆坦克跟前，用力向履带中间塞爆破筒。坦克正在行进，一时塞不进去。坦克上的敌人发现了彭德玉，突然从炮塔中冒出一人，用左轮枪向他射击。彭德玉发现自己的屁股冒火，脖子发麻，用手一摸，黏糊糊的，原来是挂花了。“我的任务还没有完成呢。”他想了一想，咬牙骂道：“管他妈的，你死我活！”他鼓起精力追坦克，赶了十几公尺远，用尽平生气力，把爆破筒塞进履带中间。他的眼前升起一团烈火，只听一声巨大的爆炸声，坦克毁了。他最后狠狠地骂了一声，拖着受伤的身子，胜利地返回自己的阵地。
    这时候的战场已经白热化了。到处是火焰，到处是射击、爆炸的声音。敌人发现这是志愿军的主阵地，大部分人坐到坦克外面，集中各种火器，向志愿军战士们射击。五连重新组织了火力，集中全部机枪，猛击坦克外面的敌人，先把他们扫光。掷弹手从容不迫地爬到坦克上，用手榴弹敲打坦克的炮塔，大声喊叫敌人投降。这批敌人非常听话，炮塔轻轻打开，先出来两只手，后出来一个头。战士们费尽气力，把这些英国兵拉出来。他们已经吓傻了，举起的手始终没有放下，你不拉他，他自己是钻不出来的。在第三辆坦克中，继英国兵之后，爬出一只洋狗，洋狗拖着尾巴，也显得有气无力。这只英国狗跑到朝鲜来干什么呢？英国兵似乎把打仗看作一种惬意的游戏，愉快的旅行，他们错了。一九五一年不是一八四○年，帝国主义横行的时代早已过去了。
    最后三辆坦克上的敌人，曾经企图进行绝望的挣扎。他们以全部火力，向四周盲目射击。榴弹炮、重机枪、卡宾枪、手枪、火焰喷射器，在坦克周围筑成一道严密的火网。陈春贵爬到距第一辆坦克五、六米处，投出一颗手榴弹，护板上的敌人立刻七歪八倒地滚到地上。陈春贵立即跳上坦克，用手榴弹敲打炮塔。一分钟内，敌人毫无动静，这就是说，他们还不想投降。陈春贵非常熟练地摸到了顶盖上的小孔，塞进两颗手榴弹。坦克被炸得跳起半尺高，几乎把他摔下来。李为经爬到另一辆坦克旁边，先用手榴弹扫清护板上的敌人，接着就要往上爬。突然，一个敌人从炮塔中探出身来，用卡宾枪向他射击。李为经抓住枪身，用力拖。敌人突然松了手，坦克乘机开动了，可是，这辆坦克也没有能逃脱，它跑了不到一百公尺，就被友军炸毁了。
　      ×　    ×　    ×
    佛弥地战斗胜利结束了。我们的战士们“摸住底了”。李广录说：“我们用佛弥地战斗告诉帝国主义者们，中国人民不是好惹的！”真的，这些英国坦克的下场，也将是美国战争贩子们的下场。佛弥地战斗也告诉了还在朝鲜战场上的侵略军士兵们：应该学习第八、第九、第十辆坦克上的英国兵；举手投降，才是生路。不要学习其余的坦克上的傻子；盲目抵抗，一定死亡。
