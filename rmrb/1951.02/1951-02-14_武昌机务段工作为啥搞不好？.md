　　Why is the Work of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot Not Being Done Well?
    Editor:
    The work of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot of the Hengyang Railway Bureau has been very poor since June of last year. The entire depot's efforts to achieve safe kilometer runs have collapsed three times in a row. Model locomotives have also broken down three times. The Factory Management Committee exists in name only. Repair tasks either involve working overtime or "going hungry" (falling behind). The number of train accidents is increasing day by day. Fuel is wasted greatly; in October and November of last year alone, over 1,100 tons of coal were wasted. Patriotic production competitions have also not been launched. The reasons for this situation are mainly: (1) Administrative leadership does not understand how to rely on the masses to engage in production; production leadership lacks planning, and when there is a plan, it is not thoroughly implemented; they do not go deep into the field, and when they occasionally do, they only verbally call for production. Last August, when the "738" locomotive underwent a Class A inspection, it was delayed for a long time due to waiting for materials. In the end, the workers had to voluntarily extend their working hours by two hours each day. (2) Union cadres do not have a clear position. They do not understand that facing production is the central task of union work; sometimes they help the administration to cry about difficulties, and sometimes they are in opposition to the administration. They cannot stand on the side of the workers to speak for them; the workers' demands, whether reasonable or unreasonable, are always perfunctory, and what can be done is not resolved in a timely manner. Workers need a toolbox and masks, etc., which require repeated requests and urging, and sometimes they still cannot get them. Workers feel that if these small things are difficult to handle, then there is no need to mention big things. Because the union cannot represent the interests of the workers, the workers do not rely on the union. (3) There is a lack of reward and punishment systems, which makes workers feel that doing more is superfluous. For example, cadres get raises when they are promoted, but workers do not get raises when they are promoted, which makes workers feel that "the benefits still go to the cadres." The fact is this: Depot Chief Su Shilong got a raise of several tens of points when he was promoted, but when artisans Zhang Debiao and Peng Yaoqing were promoted to decoration foreman, their original salaries remained unchanged, which affected the workers' enthusiasm. For example, the responsibility for the depot's "contracted operation, contracted inspection, and contracted repair" system is not clear. When an accident occurs, everyone shirks responsibility, and no one is ever found to be responsible, so everyone is always asked to share the blame a little. These situations continued until December of last year, when, after everyone made suggestions, cadres at all levels held meetings to conduct self-criticism. Now the situation has improved somewhat.

    Editor's Note: Why is the work of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot being done so poorly? The basic reason is that the administrative leaders have not truly established the idea of relying on the working class, and the policy of democratic management has not been realized; and the union work is seriously divorced from the masses, and the union cadres are not good at adhering to the correct position and neglect the labor protection and welfare issues that workers urgently need to solve and are able to solve.
    Therefore, the key to improving work is, first of all, to require the Party, government, and union leaders to establish the idea of relying on the working class through in-depth work inspections and to further establish and improve the democratic management system and launch a rationalization proposal campaign. Only by giving play to the workers' enthusiasm as masters of the country and enabling the workers to truly participate in the management of people's enterprises can the work gradually improve.

### 武昌机务段工作为啥搞不好？

　　武昌机务段工作为啥搞不好？
    编辑同志：
    衡阳铁路局武昌机务段，自去年六月以来，工作搞得很坏。全段争取的安全公里运行，连接垮了三次。模范机车先后也垮了三台。工厂管理委员会流于形式。检修任务不是加班加点，就是“拉饥荒”。行车事故一天比一天多。燃料浪费很大，光去年十、十一两月就费煤一千一百余吨。爱国主义生产竞赛也没有展开。造成这种情况的原因，主要是：（一）行政领导上不懂得依靠群众搞生产；对生产领导无计划，有计划也没有彻底实行；平时不深入现场，偶尔到了现场也只是口头上喊生产。去年八月份“七三八”机车甲检时，因等料耽误了很长时间，最后工友们只好自动每天延长两个钟头。（二）工会干部立场不明确。不懂得面向生产是工会工作的中心任务，有时帮着行政喊困难，有时又和行政闹对立。不能站在工人方面代表工人说话，工人的要求不管合理不合理总是敷衍，做得到的也不及时解决。工人要一个工具箱和口罩之类，都要三讨四催，有时还领不下来。工人认为这点小事都难得办，大事就不用提了。由于工会不能代表工人的利益，所以工人也不依靠工会。（三）缺乏奖惩制度，使工人认为多干也是多余的。比如：干部们升职就加薪，工人升职却不加薪，使工人们感到“有好处还不是干部的”。事实是这样：段长苏世隆升职加了几十分，而工匠张德标、彭耀卿升为装修工长后，还是原薪不动，这就影响了工人积极性的发挥。再如：该段包乘、包检、包修制责任都不明确，出了事故就张推李卸，从来没有检查出来，总是叫大家分担一点。这些情况一直到去年十二月，经过大伙提意见，各级干部才开会检讨，现在情况是好转一些。
                                                     曾宪邦
    编者按：武昌机务段的工作为什么搞得很坏？基本原因是行政领导干部没有真正树立依靠工人阶级的思想，民主管理的方针没有实现；而工会工作又严重的脱离群众，工会干部不善于坚持正确的立场，忽视工人迫切需要解决与可能解决的劳保福利问题。
    因此，改进工作的关键，首先要求党、政、工领导上通过深刻的工作检查，认真树立依靠工人阶级的思想，并进一步建立与健全民主管理制度，开展合理化建议运动。只有发挥了工人当家作主的积极性，并使工人真正的参加了人民企业的管理，工作才会逐步好转。
