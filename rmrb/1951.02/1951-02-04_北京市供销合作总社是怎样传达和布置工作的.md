　　How the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Communicates and Deploys Work
　　Wang Chun

　　In late January, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative spent ten days conveying the decision of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives on implementing rationing and the provisional rationing measures for the first quarter, deploying rationing work, and selecting cooperatives qualified to enjoy rationing preferences. The implementation of the rationing measures was carried out in four steps: First, the Municipal Cooperative convened a cadre conference to conduct ideological mobilization and implement policies and decision-making steps; second, each grassroots cooperative convened a meeting of directors and supervisors and a meeting of representatives to convey the policies to the members; third, inspection and evaluation; fourth, convening a evaluation and summing-up meeting, announcing the evaluation results, issuing rationing certificates, and adopting a covenant.

　　One, Convening a cadre conference to convey rationing policies and stipulate implementation steps.

　　This cadre conference was convened by the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, and presided over by Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee, and Peng Cheng, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Participants included not only the directors and supervisors of grassroots cooperatives in factories, government agencies, and schools, but also representatives from the Party, administrative, trade union, and student union representatives of various units, totaling more than 170 units. The meeting clearly pointed out the following three points: 1. Rationing work is an important measure of the state's policy of supporting cooperatives. Doing a good job in rationing can enable members to obtain inexpensive goods, promote the development and consolidation of cooperatives, and strengthen the planning of state-owned trade and cooperative trade, and expand the organized consumer market. 2. The rationing method is not just a distribution method for rationed goods, but also an important document for putting cooperatives on the right track, and an implementation program for rectifying organizations through business. 3. Implementing rationing must be combined with rectifying organizations, and the provisions of Article 4 of the interim measures must be strictly implemented, and work must be inspected according to this standard.

　　The meeting also emphasized that it is necessary to raise awareness of rationing. Rationing is not simply about asking the higher authorities for rationed goods, but about how to rectify the cooperative, starting from the long-term interests of the members, so that the members can enjoy the preferential treatment of rationing. The meeting corrected the attitudes and incorrect views of a few cooperative cadres who were afraid of trouble, feared that rationing would make less money, and disliked the low preferential rates, and did not care about the interests of the members.

　　The specific implementation steps stipulated at the meeting were: widespread dissemination and focused pilot projects. First, consumer cooperatives in factories, government agencies, and schools. Rural cooperatives will not be implemented in January, but will be specifically deployed in February.

　　Two, Grassroots cooperatives convene meetings of directors and supervisors and meetings of members' representatives to convey and discuss the rationing decision and review and summarize work.

　　Grassroots cooperatives convened meetings of directors and supervisors and meetings of members' representatives to convey the spirit of the conference and the rationing decision, and review work according to Article 4 of the rationing measures. Within a week after the conference, 96 cooperatives convened meetings of directors and supervisors, and 90 cooperatives convened meetings of members' representatives. At the meeting of members' representatives, the cooperative first reported its work to the members, and then everyone launched a discussion. The members raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the rationing work, the operation of the cooperative, and the service spirit of the cadres. The most important thing was to enable the members' representatives to have a further understanding of the cooperative's policies. For example, the representative of the Telecommunications Bureau said: "In the past, we only regarded the cooperative as a shop, and we knew too little about the cooperative's policies, and the publicity was not enough." Professor Huang of the Normal University said: "Running a cooperative cannot rely on just one or two cadres, it can only be good if everyone runs it together." Wang Sheng, a worker member of the Telecommunications Bureau, said at the meeting of members' representatives: "In the past, Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries made us unable to eat enough and keep warm. Today, we workers are our own masters, our lives have improved, and the country is giving us preferential treatment to our cooperatives, further ensuring our lives. We guarantee to publicize to the members, do a good job in the cooperative, and strive to enjoy rationing."

　　Representatives from the administrative, Party, and trade union of each unit also participated in these meetings, demonstrating everyone's concern for the cooperative, improving the work enthusiasm of the cooperative cadres, and strengthening the determination to serve.

　　Three, Summarize work, conduct mutual inspection, and finalize evaluations in three stages.

　　In the selection work, three-level evaluation is the most important link. The method of evaluation is to grasp the standards stipulated by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and summarize work. First, self-inspection, then everyone puts forward opinions and questions, launches analysis and discussion, from bottom to top, implements three-level evaluation. The first level of evaluation is carried out through mutual aid groups. Each grassroots cooperative has organized 22 mutual aid groups for business needs and mutual exchange of experience. This time, these groups were used as the basis for evaluation. Only 16 smaller cooperatives in the city did not participate. After this evaluation, a total of 54 candidate cooperatives were evaluated in the first-level evaluation among the 160 factories, government agencies, and school cooperatives in the city. The second level of evaluation is carried out through the meeting of mutual aid group leaders. The leaders of each mutual aid group report the results and conditions of the evaluation of their group to everyone, and then conduct review and discussion in four groups. As a result of this discussion, only eight of these 54 cooperatives remained. The third level of evaluation is the responsibility of the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee is composed of representatives from the Municipal Cooperative, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and seven people elected from the group leaders. Based on the results of the evaluation by the group leaders' meeting, a review is conducted, and the Shijingshan Power Plant, the General Administration of Publications, the Qingguan Bureau, and the Hui Nationality College are evaluated as meeting the conditions.

　　In the evaluation process, the unification and concretization of standards is very important. At the beginning of this evaluation, due to insufficient preparation, the evaluation was carried out in general according to the four standards in the rationing method. Because it was not specific, the standards of each group were inconsistent, and the evaluation results were also inconsistent. At the same time, some difficulties were also encountered in the evaluation. Some said: Do we measure each cooperative with the "ruler" of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, or the "municipal ruler," or the ruler of the group? Everyone felt at a loss. Each group first discussed the four standards, and summarized the four conditions into three central spirits: The first is the issue of business routes and service objects; the second and third are the central issue of economic accounting; the fourth is the issue of democracy and mass (member) base. Generally, the groups take the first and fourth articles as the main conditions, and the conditions are made more specific. For example, the concretization of the first article is: whether there is a plan, whether the plan is made by the cadres themselves, or formulated from the bottom up after investigation, the percentage of completion of the plan, whether there are cold and unpopular goods, the variety of goods, the degree of satisfaction of members' needs, the percentage of recovery of wages, and whether there is business with non-members. The concretization of the fourth article is: whether there is a board of directors, whether there are regular meetings, whether the meetings have resolutions, whether there are records, and what is the effect. Although there are specific standards, they cannot be mechanically applied in the evaluation. The main thing is to look at its actual effect. For example, the council of the Tsinghua University Cooperative is very sound, and the board of supervisors can also hold meetings on time, but they have not actually taken stock of the goods in terms of goods handling, so they failed to be selected. In the self-criticism of the cooperative and everyone's opinions, it was pointed out that this is not only that those in charge of the goods were not responsible, but also that the board of supervisors did not truly play a supervisory role, requiring them to take stock on time.

　　In addition, it is extremely important to adhere to principles, promote democracy, and launch criticism and self-criticism in the evaluation. The standard of evaluation must be based on the standards stipulated in the rationing method in principle, and cannot be relaxed. In the evaluation, each group grasped the spirit of self-criticism. For example, the Telecommunications Bureau Cooperative, the Tsinghua University Cooperative, the Clothing Factory Cooperative, and the People's Bank of China Headquarters Cooperative all focused on self-criticism. Some cooperatives asked to record the shortcomings when summarizing in the group for future inspection and improvement. In the evaluation, it is not simply to find faults, but to point out the shortcomings and analyze the reasons for the shortcomings, so that everyone can more clearly realize that the undemocratic style is the fundamental shortcoming of the cooperative. In the evaluation, everyone was serious and earnest. For example, the Cooperative of the Heavy Industry School, one of the four cooperatives that were finally evaluated, was very good in everything, but the board of supervisors did not play its due role, so it could not enjoy rationing in January. The director of the board of supervisors of the cooperative said: "We used to think that our cooperative was good, but when we looked in the mirror, we exposed our faults. This will help us quickly embark on the road to consolidation!"

　　However, in the initial evaluation, some groups also had deviations such as too wide a scale, simply finding faults, simply comparing, pulling you down if I can't be evaluated, exaggerating achievements, and being untruthful. These deviations have been corrected in a timely manner in the group evaluation.

　　Four, Convene a evaluation and summing-up meeting, announce the results, issue rationing certificates, and adopt a rationing covenant.

　　The evaluation and summing-up meeting was attended by the directors and supervisors of each cooperative. The General Evaluation Committee announced the process and results of the evaluation, and the advantages and disadvantages of the preliminary evaluation cooperatives, the secondary evaluation cooperatives, and the tertiary evaluation cooperatives were listed for everyone's reference.

　　At the meeting, the representatives of the cooperatives that were selected and several cooperatives that failed to be selected all spoke, and expressed their determination to resolutely correct the shortcomings, implement the spirit of serving the members, and do a good job in the cooperative.

　　After the meeting, rationing certificates were issued and a rationing covenant was adopted. The rationing certificates were collected by the directors of each cooperative on the spot. They also collected signature books, which were signed jointly by the directors and supervisors. The rationing covenant was formulated in accordance with Article 9 of the interim measures and passed by everyone after obtaining their consent. The original text of the covenant: (1) The rationing certificate shall not be transferred to others. (2) Do not falsely report the number of members and fraudulently purchase under false names. (3) Guarantee that the rationed goods are allocated to the members. (4) Ensure that the rationed goods are "accurate in weight, full in measure, and sufficient in size." (5) Rationed goods shall not be increased or decreased in quantity, adulterated, made damp, or replaced with inferior goods. (6) Rationed goods shall be sold at the prescribed price and shall never be changed without authorization. (7) The rationed goods shall be distributed equally in strict accordance with the regulations, without speculation, trickery, or favoritism.

　　Five, Several experiences.

　　1. The overall implementation of policies and mobilization work is not enough, and there has been no good joint research with various departments in advance. In order to remedy this shortcoming, after the Spring Festival, we plan to work with the trade union to convene a labor insurance department meeting to specifically discuss the issues of running factory cooperatives well and doing a good job in rationing. In addition, in order to implement the cooperative policy in government agencies and schools and study how to run cooperatives well, we plan to convene a separate meeting of administrative representatives of government agencies and student union representatives of schools to discuss these issues.

　　2. The standards for evaluation should be specifically stipulated in advance, but the conditions should not be mechanically matched. The spirit and essence of each condition should be understood, and work should be inspected and improved according to this standard to prevent the deviation of assembling conditions, matching conditions, and rushing conditions (some cooperatives, in order to strive for rationing, do not inspect work, but match conditions, and if the conditions are not enough, they assemble conditions and try to strive for rationing. What's more, some cooperatives have no democratic organization at all, and elect overnight after holding a conference), and strengthen the understanding that rationing must be closely combined with rectifying cooperatives.

　　3. The evaluation work mainly adopts self-reporting, and then everyone evaluates. The evaluation mainly focuses on analysis, not only finding shortcomings, but more importantly, analyzing the reasons for the shortcomings. It avoids the deviation of pure evaluation and achieves the effectiveness of inspection work. In this way, the cooperatives being evaluated do not feel that everyone is finding their faults, and they can more clearly recognize the shortcomings in their work. Some cadres said: "An analysis makes me more aware of the shortcomings of my cooperative." The evaluation work must be combined with self-criticism, inspection work, and analysis, so as to find the direction and content of rectifying cooperatives in the future.

　　4. Through the bottom-up evaluation and inspection, some shortcomings in the leadership of the general cooperative were discovered. For example: When implementing the cessation of retail transactions for non-members, some issues were not clearly stated and the instructions were not unified. Some supervisors said: "The instructor only looks for the cadres of the cooperative, never us. We don't know what we should do." Through the evaluation, we further understand the situation of the grassroots cooperatives and lay the foundation for rectifying the cooperatives in the future.

　　5. Rectifying cooperatives must be closely combined with business, and the operation of business must be implemented through organization. Rationing is inseparable from rectifying organization and developing democracy.

　　6. After the implementation of rationing, the business of cooperatives will inevitably gradually become planned. In order to adapt to this new task, the organizational form, structure, and work style of cooperatives should be improved as necessary.

　　北京市供销合作总社是怎样传达和布置工作的
    王纯
    北京市合作总社在一月下旬，以十天的时间，传达全国合作总社关于实行配售的决定和第一季度配售暂行办法，并布置配售工作，甄选具备享受配售优待的合作社。在贯彻实行配售办法中采取了四个步骤：一、由市总社召开干部大会，进行思想动员贯彻政策和决定工作步骤；二、各基层社召开理监事会和代表会，把政策贯彻到社员中去；三、进行检查工作和评判；四，召开评判总结大会，宣布评判结果，发配售证并通过公约。
            一、召开干部大会，传达配售政策，规定实施步骤。
    这次干部大会是由北京市财经委员会召集，并由财委副主任程宏毅和市工商局长彭城亲临主持，参加大会的不仅有全市工厂、机关、学校基层社的理监事主任，而且有各单位党、行政、工会和学生会的代表，共一百七十多单位。在会上明白指出下述三点：１、配售工作是国家扶助合作社政策的重要措施，办好配售可以使社员得到廉价物品，可以促进合作社的发展和巩固，可以加强国营贸易和合作贸易的计划性，扩大有组织的消费市场。２、配售办法不只是配售物品的分配办法，而且是使合作社纳入正轨的重要文件，是通过业务、整顿组织的实施纲要。３、实行配售要与整顿组织相结合，必须严格执行暂行办法第四条的规定，并根据这个标准检查工作。
    会上又着重地指出了，必须提高对配售的认识，配售不是单纯的向上级要配售物品，而是如何把合作社整顿好，从社员长期利益出发，使社员能享受配售的优待。会议并指出全面贯彻政策，提高干部认识，是实行配售巩固合作社的重要关键。会议纠正了少数合作社干部怕麻烦，怕配售赚钱少嫌优待率低等对社员利益不关心的态度，和不正确的看法。
    会议上规定的具体实施步骤是：普遍传达，重点试办。首先是工厂、机关、学校消费社。农村社一月份暂不实行，二月份具体布置。
   二、基层社召开理监事会和社员代表会，传达讨论配售决定，检查总结工作。
    基层社召开理监事会和社员代表大会，传达大会精神及配售的决定，根据配售办法第四条检查工作。在大会召开后一星期中就有九十六社召开了理监事会，九十个社召开了社员代表大会。在社员代表大会上，先由合作社向社员报告工作，然后大家展开讨论，社员们对配售工作、合作社的经营及干部的服务精神等提出很多批评和建议。最主要的是使社员代表对合作社的政策有了进一步的认识。如电信局的代表说：“过去我们只把合作社当成铺子，对合作社的政策知道的太少，宣传的也不够。”师范大学黄教授说：“办合作社只凭一两个干部不行，非大家起来办才能好。”电信局工人社员王升在社员代表大会上说：“过去，日本帝国主义和国民党反动派，使得我们吃不饱，穿不暖，今天我们工人自己当了主人，生活改善了，国家又来优待我们合作社，更进一步使我们生活有保证，我们保证向社员宣传，把合作社搞好，争取享受配售。”
    这些会议中并有各单位的行政，党、工会的代表参加，表现了大家对合作社的关心，提高了合作社干部的工作情绪，加强了服务的决心。
            三、总结工作，互相检查，三评定案。
    在甄选工作中，三级评定是最重要的一个环节。评定的办法是掌握全国总社规定的标准，检查总结工作。首先自我检查，然后大家提出意见和问题，展开分析讨论，自下而上，实行三评定案。第一级评判是通过互助小组进行的。各基层社为了业务的需要和互相交流经验，曾组织了二十二个互助小组。这次就以这些小组为基础进行评判。全市合作社中只有十六个较小的社没有参加。经过这次评定，全市一六○个工厂、机关、学校社在一级评议中共评出候评社五十四个。第二级评定是通过互助组长会议，由各互助组长将本组评判结果及条件，向大家报告，然后分四个小组进行审查讨论，这五十四个合作社，经过这次讨论的结果，只剩下八个。第三级评定是由评判委员会负责进行。评判委员会由市总社、市总工会、市财委会和全国总社派代表，并由组长中推选七人共同组成。根据组长会议评判的结果，再进行审查，结果评定石景山发电厂、出版总署、清管局、回民学院，四个合作社符合条件。
    在评判过程中，标准的统一和具体化，是很重要的。这次评判开始时因准备不够，只是一般地根据配售办法中的四个标准进行评定。因为没有具体化，所以各组标准不一，评判结果也不一致。同时在评判中也遇到一些困难。有的说：我们衡量每个合作社是用全国总社的“尺子”，还是“市尺”，或是小组的尺子呢？大家有无所适从的感觉。各小组在进行中首先都讨论了四个标准，将四个条件归纳为三个中心精神：第一条是经营路线和服务对象问题；第二、三条中心是经济核算制；第四条是民主和群众（社员）基础问题。一般的小组皆以第一条和第四条为主要条件，并且将条件更具体化了。例如第一条的具体化是：有无计划，计划是干部自己做的，还是自下而上经过调查而制定的，完成计划程度的百分比，有无冷背货，货品种类如何，满足社员需要程度，收回工资百分比是多少，有无非社员生意等。第四条的具体化是：有无理监事会，是否有定期会议，会议有无决议，有无记录，效果如何等。虽然有了具体标准，但在评判当中也不能机械搬用，主要是看其实际效果，例如清华大学合作社理事会很健全，监事会也能按期开会，但就是在货品处理上没有实际盘货，因而落选。在该社的自我批评和大家的意见中，指出这不只是管货品的没有负责任，也是监事会没有真正起了监督作用，令其按时盘货。
    此外，在评判中坚持原则，发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，也是极其重要的。评判的标准必须以配售办法规定的标准为原则，不能放宽。在评判中各组都掌握了自我批评的精神，例如电信局社，清华大学社，被服总厂社，人民银行总行社，都是以自我批评为主。有的合作社在小组做总结时，要求将缺点记录上，以便下次检查、改进，在评判中不是单纯地找毛病，而是指出缺点，并分析缺点产生的原因，使大家比较明确的认识到不民主作风是合作社的根本缺点。在评判中，大家都严肃认真，如最后被评下的四个合作社中的重工业学校社，一切都很好，就是监事会没有起到应有作用，因而一月份不能享受配售。该社监事主任说：“我们过去认为我们的合作社不错，但在镜子下一照即露出毛病来了，这样就帮助我们迅速走上巩固的道路！”
    但在开始评判中，有的小组也发生了尺度太宽、单找毛病、单纯比较，我评不上也得把你拉下来、夸大成绩和不真实等偏向，这些偏向在小组评判中已及时纠正。
     四、召开评判总结大会，宣布结果，发配售证，通过配售公约。
    评判总结大会有各社理事及监事主任参加，由总评委会宣布评判的经过和结果，并将初评社、二评社及三评社的优点和缺点列榜公布。供大家参阅。
    在会上被评选上的及若干落选的合作社的代表都讲了话，并表明坚决纠正缺点贯彻为社员服务精神，把合作社办好。
    会后发配售证和通过配售公约。配售证由各社理事主任当场领取。并领取签字书，由理监事主任共同签字。配售公约是根据暂行办法第九条制订的取得大家同意后表决通过。公约的原文：（１）配售证不得转让他人。（２）不虚报社员人数，假名套购。（３）保证配售物品一定配给社员。（４）配售品必须保证做到“秤平、斗满、尺码足”。（５）配售品不得增减定量、掺杂、使潮或以劣货顶替。（６）配售品按照规定价格出售，绝不擅自更改。（７）配售品分量，坚决按照规定平均分配，不投机、不取巧，不作私情。
            五、几点经验。
    一、全面贯彻政策和动员工作做的不够，事先没有很好地与各部门共同研究。为了补救这个缺点，过春节后，准备协同工会召开劳保部会议，专门讨论办好工厂合作社及作好配售工作等问题。另外，为了在机关和学校中贯彻合作社政策，并研究如何办好合作社，准备单独召开机关行政代表及学校学生会代表会议，讨论这些问题。
    二、评判的标准应事先具体规定，但不能机械地对条件，应当领会每一条件的精神和实质，并根据此标准来检查、改进工作，防止凑条件、对条件、突击条件的偏向（有的合作社为了争取配售，不是检查工作，而是对条件，条件不够时，就凑条件，设法争取配售。更有的合作社根本没有民主组织，开过大会后即连夜选举），加强配售要密切结合整顿合作社的认识。
    三、评判工作主要采取自报，然后大家评判。评判主要着重分析，不但找出缺点，更主要的是分析缺点产生的原因。避免了单纯的评判的偏向，收到检查工作的效用。这样被评判的社，也不感觉是大家找他的毛病，对自己工作中的缺点能认识得更明确，有的干部说：“一分析，使我更明白自己合作社缺点的所在”。评判工作必须以自我批评结合检查工作和分析，这样才能找出今后整顿合作社的方向和内容。
    四、经过自下而上的评判检查，发现了总社领导中的若干缺点。例如：执行停止非社员零售交易时，有些问题讲的不明确，指示不统一，有的监事说：“指导员只找合作社的干部，从来不找我们，应当做什么，我们也不知道”。通过评判，进一步了解了基层社的情况，打下今后整顿合作社的基础。
    五、整社必须密切结合业务进行，业务的经营要通过组织来贯彻。配售与整顿组织、开展民主是分不开的。
    六、实施配售后，合作社的业务必然逐渐走上计划性，为了适应这一新的任务，合作社的组织形式、机构、工作作风，应加以必要的改进。
