　　The editor of "People's Literature and Art" asked me to write an article on sorting out and developing Chinese dance. This is a big topic, and I am not familiar enough with Chinese dance to do more than express some thoughts.

　　Chinese dance is very rich and has a long history. Both folk and classical dances are very beautiful. However, Chinese dance is mostly combined with opera, such as Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, and has not developed into an independent art form. This time I came to China, on the one hand, to enrich Korean dance by studying Chinese dance, and on the other hand, to help the Chinese dance community complete the work of sorting out Chinese dance. Because in the ancient Tang Dynasty of China and the Goguryeo era of Korea, the dance exchange between China and Korea was very prosperous. I am willing to do my part in further exchanging Chinese and Korean dance experiences. I am fortunate to have received help from the predecessors of Chinese Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera. At the same time, I have had experience in sorting out various basic movements of Korean dance and Southern dance (in the past, Korean and Oriental dances did not have basic training). I think I can achieve some results.

　　The work of sorting out Chinese classical dance can be roughly divided into two stages. Chinese classical traditional dance art is a rich and precious heritage left to us by our ancestors, and we need to inherit and carry it forward well. The material of traditional dance is very rich, but a set of basic movements has not yet been sorted out. Therefore, the first stage should focus on capturing the most typical, beautiful, heroic, and unique representative movements and dance postures in classical dance. This capture work should preserve its original characteristics as much as possible, abandon some unnecessary movements, and then slightly improve and process the original movements as needed. For example, make the original weak movements powerful; make the imperfect ones more beautiful; and add technology to the technically deficient ones. Movement is related to expression. In terms of expression, we should learn some beautiful movements from Peking Opera that express emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and exaggerate these movements even more, because for dance, body expression is very important. Some expressions in Peking Opera have relatively small movements, such as movements of sadness and happiness. If we want to dance these, we must exaggerate the original movements in Peking Opera, and regularize and rhythmize the body's expressions and movements. If we can achieve this, then the movements can become true dance art movements.

　　The characters in Chinese Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera are very rich. For easier mastery, they can be classified. Female characters can be divided into Qingyi, Huadan, Wudan, etc.; male characters can be divided into Xiaosheng, Wusheng, Hualian, Wuchou, etc. The typical movements of each type of character should be analyzed and synthesized.

　　It is very important to analyze the movements of various types of characters, from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, from simple to complex. Taking the walking movements of Qingyi and Huadan as an example, it is about how to gradually complicate the single walking movement. Walking forward, walking diagonally, walking horizontally, and then combining hand movements, turning movements, sitting movements, etc. Divide them into sequential order and arrange them into the first movement, the second movement... The sorting and analysis of these movements must go through selection and abandonment, and then study the problem of how to apply them, that is, how to put several movements together, add your own understanding, enrich it emotionally, and develop it in movement, so as to express a certain intention. This is the same as how application problems in arithmetic are applied. We must master various single movements and also understand the method of application in order to achieve the purpose of creation.

　　The first stage of capture work is easy to achieve results, but the second stage of creation work is difficult and long-term, and requires continuous effort. The history of Korean dance has been interrupted, and dance art has been buried by feudal forces and Japanese imperialism. Many classical forms of dance have been lost. I have gradually revived, sorted out, and developed them into new styles of classical dance works. For example, Sword Dance, Drum Dance, and Fan Dance are all original classical dance forms. Also, Long Drum Dance, Mask Dance, etc. were originally peasant dance forms. After I reorganized, restored, and developed them, they became stage art works. I have also sorted out a set of basic movements with rich Korean national characteristics from these movements. I have also created many new works, such as: "Breaking Through the Waves", "Childlike Innocence", etc. These works did not exist before. They were all created from materials collected from life, just as poets collect materials and refine the people's thoughts and feelings into poems. It is very difficult to combine traditional dance art forms with the new life and new characters of reality, to become a new content, a new form, and at the same time an art with its own national characteristics. I myself have been working hard for this art career for more than 20 years. The second stage of sorting out Chinese classical dance is also the same. We need to express the new characters of the new era. These characters no longer walk like stepping in Peking Opera, so we also need new techniques to express them, which requires the creation of new movements. This cannot be achieved overnight. It requires long-term research and experimentation, and can only be completed through the accumulation of experience. It requires today's dance art workers, including the predecessors of Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, and new dance workers, to work together to create a new Chinese dance art with new content, new forms, and at the same time rich in national characteristics and style.

　　For the creation of new dance art, I think that on the one hand, we should extract materials from Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera. For example, the Wusheng in Peking Opera is very expressive and has very skillful techniques. But it is not an independent dance art. Therefore, there is no layout, no climax, and some movements do not have a clear purpose. We can absorb its rich techniques to express a certain meaning, such as using the movements of Wusheng to express the battle of a certain historical hero. There is a layout, there are ups and downs, there is a climax, and there is an ending. In this way, it can become an independent dance art work. Furthermore, styling and diversifying sword dance, flower gun, and silk dance can also become independent dance works on the stage. This makes dance art independent from Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera.

　　On the other hand, we must absorb materials from folk dance. Waist drum, Yangko, and Taiping drum are peasant art works. These art forms are very rich and healthy, but the techniques are relatively simple and rough. We should preserve its simple rural flavor, and at the same time enrich and improve it technically, stylize it, and make it an independent dance work on the stage. This is how I sorted out the Korean folk "Long Drum Dance" and "Mask Dance".

　　Furthermore, we must obtain materials from real life and create. For example, the works I created, such as "Breaking Through the Waves", "Childlike Innocence", and "Chailang and the Virgin", all obtained new characters' emotions and new events from real life, and used Korean national-style dance techniques to express them. For example, An Shengji is now creating "The Lover of the Chinese Volunteer Army", "Little Guerrilla Girl", and "Horseback Battle", all of which reflect the new characters and new emotions in the Korean patriotic war, and reflect the characters and events of the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.

　　Expressing the new characters in real life is not enough with purely oriental techniques and movements. Because the emotions of the oriental people are more hidden and deep, and the expressive forms of the movements are also more subtle and beautiful. The emotions of Westerners are more unrestrained and enthusiastic, and the expressive forms of the movements are more intense, large and powerful. Therefore, we also need to learn Western techniques and methods of expression to make our movements more powerful and suitable for expressing new combat lives and characters. It is wrong to merely imitate Western techniques. We should digest Western techniques well and make them our own flesh and blood, adapt to our own needs, and express our own lives and emotions. At the same time, we must pay attention to a very important issue, that is, we must have our own national characteristics, our own national inherent breath, and our own national style. This is a very important issue, and it is also a difficult issue to deal with. This requires continuous efforts and experiments to achieve.

　　China's traditional dance art is very rich. In the past two years, the growth of new dance art has also been very fast. How to better create dance art that is rich in national form and expresses new characters and new events is something that requires our joint long-term efforts to study. I am only making a suggestion and assisting. The main thing still depends on the predecessors of Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera, famous actors, folk artists, and new dance art workers to work together. In a great country like China, with a long history and a rich art treasure house, as long as you go to any museum or scenic spot to see, you will feel how rich our ancestors left us with. Today, our construction and achievements do not know how many times they will exceed our ancestors. This is a great era. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, these great achievements will surely be realized at super speed. Dance art is only a small part of the cultural sea, but with the development of politics, economy and culture, it will surely move forward steadily. Today's sowing foreshadows a brilliant harvest.

### 中国舞蹈艺术的将来

　　中国舞蹈艺术的将来
　　崔承喜
    《人民文艺》的编者要我写一篇关于整理与发展中国舞蹈的文章。这个题目很大，我对于中国舞蹈还不够熟悉，只能发表一点感想。
    中国舞蹈很丰富，历史很悠久，无论是民间的、古典的，都非常优美。但中国舞蹈大都和戏曲，如京戏、昆曲等结合在一起，没有发展成为一种独立的艺术。我这回来中国，一面借助研究中国舞蹈来丰富朝鲜舞蹈，一面帮助中国舞蹈界来完成整理中国舞蹈的工作。因为在中国古代的唐朝和朝鲜的高句丽的时代，中朝两国的舞蹈交流是很盛的。我愿在进一步交流中朝舞蹈经验上尽我的一份力量。我幸运地获得了中国京剧昆曲的先辈们帮助，同时我自己曾有过整理朝鲜舞南方舞等各种基本动作的经验（过去的朝鲜和东方的舞蹈都是没有基本训练的），我想可以收到一些成果。
    对于中国古典舞的整理工作，大致可以分两个阶段来进行。中国古典传统舞蹈艺术是祖先给我们留下的丰富而宝贵的遗产，需要我们很好地来继承和发扬。传统舞蹈的素材是很丰富的，可是还没有整理出来一套基本动作。因此第一阶段应该着重在摄取古典舞中最典型的、优美的、英武的、有它独特性的代表动作和舞姿。这个摄取工作，一方面要尽量保存它原来的特性，一方面要抛弃一些不必要的动作，并再根据需要，把原有的动作稍加提高和加工。譬如，原来软弱的，使它有力；不够美好的，使它更美好；技术不够的，再增加技术。动作是和表情有关的。在表情方面，我们要学习京剧里的一些表达喜怒哀乐等表情的美好的动作，更要把这些动作夸大起来，因为对于舞蹈，身体的表情是很重要的。京剧里的某些表情，动作比较小，例如悲哀和高兴的动作。如果要把它舞蹈化起来，必须把原来京剧里的动作更夸大一点，把身体的表情动作加以规律化，节奏化。如果能够达到这点，那末动作就能成为真正的舞蹈艺术的动作。
    中国京剧昆曲中的人物是非常丰富的，为了更易于掌握起见，可以把它分类。女性的可以分青衣、花旦、武旦等；男性的可以分小生、武生、花脸、武丑等。应该把各类人物的典型动作，加以分析和综合。
    把各类人物的动作加以分析是很重要的，要由浅而深，由易而难，由简而繁。拿青衣花旦的步行动作来说，就是怎样把单一的步行动作逐渐复杂化。向前步行，斜的步行，横的步行，再合上手的动作，转的动作，坐的动作等等。分成先后秩序，排成第一动作，第二动作……。这些动作的整理和分析都要经过选择和扬弃，然后再研究如何应用的问题，即是如何把几个动作放在一起，再加上自己的理解，在感情上充实它，动作上发展它，这样来表现某一个意图，这与算术的应用题怎样应用是一样的。我们掌握了各种单一的动作，还必须懂得应用的方法，这样才能达到创作的目的。
    第一阶段摄取工作是容易收到成效的，第二阶段的创作工作却是艰苦的，长期的，需要不断努力的。朝鲜的舞蹈历史曾经间断，舞蹈艺术被封建势力和日本帝国主义的压迫埋没了，有许多古典形式的舞蹈都失传了。我把它逐渐复兴起来，整理起来，发展成新样式的古典舞蹈作品，如剑舞、鼓舞、扇舞等都是原来有的古典舞蹈形式。又如长鼓舞、假面舞等原来都是农民的舞蹈形式，经过我把它重新整理恢复发展起来，成为舞台艺术作品。又从这些动作中整理出来一套富有朝鲜民族特征的基本动作。我也创作了许多新的作品，如：《冲破浪涛》、《童心》等等。这些作品都是从前没有的，都是从生活中收集材料创作成的，这正如诗人收集材料把人民的思想感情提炼出来写成诗是一样的。要把传统的舞蹈艺术形式和现实的新生活、新人物结合起来，成为新内容、新形式、同时富有自己民族特点的艺术，这个工作是很不容易的。我自己二十多年来一直为这个艺术事业努力着。整理中国古典舞的第二阶段也是如此。需要表现新时代的新人物，这些人物的走路不再象京剧里的迈步子一样，因此也需要有新的技术来表现，这样就需要创作新的动作。这不是一朝一夕所能成功的，需要长期研究试验，靠经验的积累才能完成。需要我们今天的舞蹈艺术工作者，包括京剧、昆曲的先辈，新舞蹈工作者，大家一起努力，才能创造新内容、新形式，同时又富有民族特点和气派的新的中国舞蹈艺术。
    对于新舞蹈艺术的创造，我想一方面要从昆曲、京剧里去摄取材料。例如京剧里的武生，是很有表现力的，技术很巧妙。但并不是独立的舞蹈艺术。因此没有布局，没有高潮，有些动作没有明确的目的性。我们可以吸取它丰富的技术来表现某一个意义，如用武生的动作来表现历史上的某一英雄人物的战斗。有布局，有起伏，有高潮，有结局。这样就可以成为一个独立的舞蹈艺术作品。再如把舞剑、花枪、舞绸子等加以风格化，多样化，也可以成为舞台上的独立的舞蹈作品。这样就使得舞蹈艺术从京戏昆曲里边独立出来。
    另一方面要从民间舞蹈中去吸取材料。腰鼓、秧歌、太平鼓等是农民的艺术作品。这些艺术形式很丰富，很健康，可是技术比较简单、粗糙。我们应该保存它朴素的乡土味道，同时又要从技术上来丰富它，提高它，将它样式化，成为舞台上独立的舞蹈作品。我整理朝鲜民间的“长鼓舞”、“假面舞”等，就是这样做法的。
    再一方面我们必须从现实的生活中去取得材料，进行创作。譬如说我创作的《冲破浪涛》、《童心》、《柴郎与处女》等作品都是从现实生活中，取得新的人物的感情，新的事件，用朝鲜民族形式的舞蹈技术来表现的。再如现在安圣姬正在创作的《中国志愿部队的爱人》、《游击队小姑娘》、《骑马战》等，都是反映朝鲜的爱国战争中的新人物、新感情，反映中朝人民友谊合作，抗美援朝的人物和事件的。
    表现现实生活中的新人物，纯粹靠东方的技术和动作是不够的。因为东方的人民，感情比较隐藏、深沉，动作的表现形式，也比较细微、优美。西洋人的感情比较奔放、热烈，动作的表现形式比较强烈，大而有力。因此我们也需要学习西洋的技术和表现方法，使得我们的动作更加有力，适宜于表现新的战斗的生活和人物。学习西洋技术仅仅模仿是不对的，应该把西洋的技术经过自己很好的消化，成为自己的血肉，适应自己的需求，表现自己的生活、感情。同时还要注意一个很重要的问题，即一定要有自己民族的特点，自己民族固有的气息，自己民族的风格。这是非常重要的问题，也是一个不容易处理的问题，这是需要不断地努力和实验才能达到的。
    中国的传统舞蹈艺术是非常丰富的。这两年来新舞蹈艺术的成长也非常快。如何更好地来创造富有民族形式，表现新人物、新事件的舞蹈艺术，这是需要我们共同长期努力研究的。我只是作一个建议和协助，主要的还是靠昆曲、京剧的先辈、名演员、民间艺术家和新舞蹈艺术工作者来共同努力。象中国这样一个伟大的国家，有悠久的历史，丰富的艺术宝库，只要随便到那个博物馆或名胜古迹去看看，就觉得我们的祖先给我们留下多么丰富的产业，今天我们的建设和成就不知道会超过祖先多少倍。这是一个伟大的时代。在毛主席的领导下，这些伟大的成就一定会超速度地实现。舞蹈艺术在文化大海中不过是小小的一部分，可是随着政治、经济、文化的发展，一定也会健步向前。今天的播种，预兆着辉煌的收获。
