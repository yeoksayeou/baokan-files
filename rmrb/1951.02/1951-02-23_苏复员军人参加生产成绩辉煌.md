Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd: According to TASS Moscow, February 21st, millions of Soviet demobilized soldiers who are engaged in peaceful labor in factories, collective farms, and cultural institutions have achieved brilliant successes on the production front. Nesterov, a steelworker in a factory in Dnepropetrovsk, overfulfilled his steel production quota by 450 tons in February. Siromyatnikov, former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Naval Artillery, completed a thesis at the Ural Industrial Research Institute on the accelerated combustion of pulverized fuel in improved furnaces, making outstanding contributions to this technological process. Makarov, who was awarded the Order of the Red Star during the war, is now leading the famous high-yielding field work team of the Budyonny Collective Farm in the Kharkov region. In the Kharkov region, thirty-two demobilized soldiers have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their outstanding production achievements. Many demobilized soldiers are now celebrating Soviet Army Day with their new achievements. In the factories of Moscow, thousands of work teams have launched the Stakhanovite work shift movement to celebrate Soviet Army Day. Demobilized soldiers working in the Moscow Foundry have greatly increased labor productivity and improved product quality. Many demobilized soldiers have produced 50 to 100 percent more than the quota.
