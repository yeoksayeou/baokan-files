Import 2 million meters of cloth to provide clothing and bedding to disaster victims free of charge. Distribute 30,000 tons of grain to disaster victims who cannot sustain themselves and farmers who have no grain, to ensure they obtain the means of subsistence and enable them to participate in agricultural production. Rapidly restore medical institutions in each province and city and establish mobile medical stations in rural areas to provide free medical assistance to disaster victims. Exempt or reduce various taxes payable by disaster victims in war zones.
    Guaranteeing the 1951 spring planting: Land belonging to national traitors or other uncultivated land should be given priority to farmers with little land or disaster victims willing to engage in agricultural production. Plan to expand the cultivated area of early crops to meet the wartime need for grain. Help farmers solve the difficulties of seed and insufficient livestock during the spring planting season. Mobilize workers, staff, and their families, as well as rear service troops, to assist farmers in spring planting.

    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁二十五日颁布关于在祖国解放战争时期安定人民生活的办法的决定。
    决定称：朝鲜人民在伟大的祖国解放战争中发挥了无上的英勇精神和献身精神。朝鲜的和平城市与乡村，因为美国强盗的野蛮轰炸，遭到了严重的破坏。被破坏的工厂、矿山、企业所和住宅达六十一万余所。损失家畜达战前数目的百分之六十以上。共和国内阁为了迅速救济在祖国解放战争中遭到重大损失的战区灾民，安定人民的生活，兹特决定：
    救济战区灾民并安定其生活：给予因战争灾难而失去住所的人民重建或修葺住宅时所需要的一切帮助。借给战区每户灾民为期三年的二万元贷款。输入布匹二百万公尺，以衣物和被褥无偿供给灾民。以粮食三万吨分发给无法生活的灾民和没有粮食的农民，保证他们获得生活资料并使他们能够参加农业生产。尽速在各道各城市恢复医疗机关并在农村设立医疗巡回站，给予灾民免费医疗的援助。免征或减收战区灾民应缴的各种赋税。
    保障一九五一年的春耕：凡属民族叛徒的土地或其他无人耕种的土地应优先分给少地的农民或愿意从事农业生产的灾民耕种。计划扩大早期作物的耕种面积，以应战时对于粮食的需要。帮助农民解决种籽和春耕时期畜力不足的困难。动员工人、职员和他们的家属，以及后方部队，协助农民进行春耕。
