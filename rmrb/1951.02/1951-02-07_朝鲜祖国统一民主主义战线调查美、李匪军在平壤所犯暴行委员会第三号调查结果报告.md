The Committee for Investigating the Atrocities Committed by the American and Li Bandit Troops in Pyongyang, of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front

Following a preliminary investigation by the investigation committee into the atrocities committed by the American and Li bandit troops in Pyongyang, the following facts have been established: During their occupation of Pyongyang for approximately one and a half months, the American aggressors and the Li Seung-man bandit troops committed unprecedented atrocities, flagrantly disregarding international law and the most basic principles of human morality. Their behavior resembled that of medieval barbarians in a conquered country. The Americans and Li Seung-man bandit troops collectively massacred peaceful residents, raped and humiliated women, plundered people's property, and destroyed industrial facilities, municipal services, cultural institutions, and residences. They harbored a fanatical hatred for the Korean people and were determined to turn the ancient capital of Korea, the fortress of the Korean democratic movement – the city of Pyongyang – into scorched earth.

I. Terror Against Residents, Rape of Women, and Other Atrocities

During the temporary occupation of Pyongyang by the American and Li bandit troops, many innocent and peaceful residents were massacred. They imprisoned, beat, shot, and hanged personnel from the People's Government organs, members of democratic parties and social organizations, especially members of the Workers' Party. At the same time, they arrested the family members of these individuals—the elderly, weak, women, and children—also imprisoning them, subjecting them to torture, and killing them.

As a result of these crimes committed by the American and Li bandit troops during their occupation of Pyongyang, over 15,000 residents were killed. They arrested over 4,000 patriots and democrats, imprisoning them in Pyongyang Prison, where over 2,000 were shot in the prison execution grounds. Twenty-six air raid shelters, three water wells, and three reservoirs were filled with their corpses. Furthermore, when the People's Army troops arrived in Pyongyang, they found eighty-six corpses in the prison execution grounds that the American and Li executioners had not had time to remove.

On December 4th, as the American and Li bandit troops fled in disarray, they used machine guns to fire through the window openings of the prison cells, killing many of the detainees.

Before retreating from Pyongyang, the American and Li bandit troops did their utmost to spread panic among the residents, disseminating absurd rumors that the Chinese Communist troops were about to arrive and would kill every last resident of Pyongyang, and that Pyongyang would be bombarded with atomic bombs, etc.

They used intimidation and threats to force residents to relocate to the south bank of the Daedong River, claiming that anyone who did not evacuate the city would be regarded as a "red" element and suppressed.

Intimidated residents—men and women—began to cross the Daedong River on December 3rd and 4th via bridges, or by sitting on boats, barrels, or wooden planks. However, as a large group of residents was crossing the bridge, the retreating American and Li bandit troops blew up the bridge. At the same time, numerous American jet aircraft used machine guns to strafe the crowds on the banks and those crossing the river.

In this way, the American and Li bandit troops massacred approximately 4,000 completely innocent Pyongyang residents on December 3rd and 4th. Witnesses said that on December 4th, the Daedong River was filled with corpses, and the blood of the dead turned the river red.

The American and Li bandit troops, on the pretext that Korean patriotic elements were using air raid shelters as bases for their resistance, forced residents to fill the air raid shelters with earth and killed those hiding inside. A total of 328 residents' corpses were found in eight air raid shelters in the western district of Pyongyang, killed in this manner.

Every day, without court trials, residents accused of "sympathizing with the communists" were shot. Among those killed in this way were citizen Li Wen, residing at No. 56 Xue Shui Li (transliteration), Pyongyang City; Cui Chengqin (transliteration), a teacher instructing illiterate students in District 10, Xue Shui Li (transliteration), Pyongyang City; citizen Han Haocheng (transliteration), residing in Xicheng Li, Pyongyang City; Wen Xiangtai (transliteration), a teacher at the Pyongyang Industrial Vocational School, and many others.

During their occupation of Pyongyang, the American and Li bandit troops raped a large number of women.

Only a few examples are cited:

On October 25th, the enemy, threatening her with a pistol, raped Park Qiu-ok, only eighteen years old, residing in Shang Shui Li, Pyongyang.

In the office of the Daehan Youth Corps in Ganxing Yi Li, Americans raped two housewives and a young girl, and also raped the wife of citizen Park Minghao.

Li Dongyan's wife (thirty-two years old), residing in Dongchang Li, Pyongyang, was gang-raped by five Americans. Choi Heung-seok's (transliteration) wife was gang-raped by two American soldiers. Even Li Chongkun's fifty-four-year-old wife was gang-raped by two Americans.

Citizen Zhao Chengnuo, residing at No. 4 Shangxing Li, was arrested, and three days later, three American soldiers went to rape his wife. American troops arrested many wives of patriotic individuals and imprisoned them in Yuancun Li and Si Dong Er Li, where they were constantly violated day and night.

The American and Li bandit troops flagrantly violated the Geneva Conventions regarding prisoners of war and the wounded, mistreating and killing captured People's Army soldiers. For example, American troops shot approximately seventy captured People's Army soldiers in Qifo Li, eastern district of Pyongyang City, and shot fifty people in Youli (transliteration) Er Li. Prisoners of war held at the original site of the Pyongyang Textile Factory were forced to spend nights in the open air in the cold November weather. The wounded and sick received no medical treatment, and many of them died as a result.

II. Destruction of Industrial Equipment, Buildings, and Cultural Institutions.

After temporarily occupying Pyongyang, the American and Li bandit troops' engineering special forces destroyed and burned industrial enterprises and buildings in Pyongyang City when they withdrew from the city.

Before retreating from Pyongyang, the American and Li bandit troops destroyed all the equipment of the Pyongyang Chemical Factory and burned down the factory buildings and dormitories. The equipment and buildings of the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the East Pyongyang Machine Manufacturing Factory, the Si Dong Coking Plant and its power station, the Pyongyang Towel Factory, the Pyongyang Underwear Factory, the Pyongyang Sugar Refinery, the Pyongyang Light Bulb Factory, the Record Manufacturing Factory, the Needle Manufacturing Factory, the Pyongyang Cigarette Factory, the Longshan Chemical Factory, the Pyongyang Central Department Store, etc., which had survived the bombing, were completely destroyed.

The American and Li bandit troops completely destroyed Kim Il-sung University, Russian Language University, Normal University, Postal Specialized School, Industrial University, Central Party School of the Workers' Party, First Senior High School, Second Senior High School, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth Junior High Schools, Second Girls' Senior High School, Fifth Girls' Junior High School, Fourteenth, Nineteenth, Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth Elementary Schools, all built by the people of the northern part of the Republic with their own hands. Teaching reference books and furniture were either doused with gasoline and burned or used as fuel.

They also bombed and burned down the Central Hospital, the National Art Theater, the editorial department of the "Labor News" newspaper, and other cultural institutions.

The American and Li bandits set fire to hundreds of thousands of volumes of books from the National Central Library, the Kim Il-sung University Library, other agency libraries, bookstores, and private libraries; they destroyed the Pyongyang Museum, smashed the exhibits there, destroyed many historical monuments, such as the tombstones of the Lelang period, Bubbyeongnu Pavilion, one of the eight ancient sites of Korea, and stole the gold trim from the Buddha statues in Yongmyong Temple.

The American aggressors also bombed and destroyed the main water pipes and reservoirs supplying drinking water to 400,000 Pyongyang residents, the power station supplying electricity to Pyongyang City, completely destroyed the railway bridges and pedestrian bridges across the Daedong River, and the city's tram network.

The American and Li bandit troops destroyed the buildings of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Cabinet, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the official residence of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, the Pyongyang Telecommunications Bureau, the Central Bank, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, and other large buildings.

III. Plundering People's Property

During their occupation of Pyongyang, the American and Li bandit troops not only robbed state organs, enterprises, warehouses, and warehouses of the Consumers' Cooperative Federation, but also robbed private warehouses, enterprises, and residents' homes.

The families of those arrested by the American and Li bandit troops were all evicted from their homes, and all their property was stolen by the bandit troops.

Drunken American soldiers often broke into residents' homes to rob the most valuable items. For example, American soldiers who broke into the home of Jin Genlian in Dongchang Li, Pyongyang City, stole two gold rings from his wife's hand; another American soldier who broke into the home of Jin Desan in Ganxing Li stole a watch, and an American soldier who broke into the home of Shen Rongjiu in Shangxing Li stole forty bags of rice, a pig, a sewing machine, three blankets, and a thousand bundles of firewood and other property; from the homes of Zhao Shimin, Jin Luanjun, Quan Xuande, Wu Longyi, Zhang Jishan, and Park Jishan in Ganxing Li, the Li Seung-man bandit troops stole a total of one hundred and fifty-eight bags of rice, six pigs, two oxen, and more than two hundred pyeong (unit of area) of vegetables; American soldiers who broke into the home of Quan Fengyun, a rice mill in Zhengping Li, southern district, beat the owner of the residence and stole gold and other valuables worth 70 million won (Korean currency).

In Qifoli Village, the American and Li bandit troops stole six oxen, seventy pigs, and two hundred chickens.

The atrocities committed by the American and Li bandit troops have aroused great anger among the Korean people towards the aggressors and their Korean accomplices, the Li Seung-man bandit gang.

The investigation committee brings the above facts to the attention of the Korean people and world public opinion and firmly believes that all peace-loving people in the world will condemn these atrocities committed by foreign aggressors and Korean reactionaries under the banner of the United Nations.

　　朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查美、李匪军在平壤       
    所犯暴行委员会第三号调查结果报告
    经调查委员会初步调查美、李匪军在平壤所犯暴行的结果，确定了下列事实：美国侵略者和李承晚匪军在占领平壤约一个半月中，犯下了空前未有的暴行，悍然蔑视国际法和人类道德最基本的原则。他们的行为像中世纪的野蛮人在被他们征服的国家中的行为一样。美国人和李承晚匪军集体屠杀和平居民，强奸并侮辱妇女，劫掠人民财产；破坏工业设备、市政事业、文化机关以及住宅等。他们疯狂地仇恨朝鲜人民，决心把朝鲜的古都，朝鲜民主运动的堡垒——平壤城化为焦土。
    一、用恐怖反对居民，强奸妇女及其他暴行
    在美、李匪军暂时占领平壤期间，屠杀了许多无辜的和平居民。他们将人民政府机关的工作人员，民主党派及社会组织的成员，首先便是劳动党党员，投入监狱，殴打，枪杀，绞死，同时，逮捕这些人员的家属——老弱妇孺，将他们也投入监狱，严刑拷打并加以杀害。
    由于美、李匪军在占领平壤期间此等罪行的结果，有一万五千多个居民被杀死。他们逮捕了四千多个爱国者和民主人士，把他们囚禁在平壤监狱内，其中有两千多人在监狱刑场上被枪毙了。二十六个防空壕和三口水井，三个蓄水池都填满了这些人的尸体。此外，人民军部队到达平壤时，还在监狱刑场上找到美、李刽子手来不及移去的八十六具尸体。
    十二月四日，美、李匪军在慌乱地逃跑时，用机枪从牢房的窗洞中扫射死了许多被羁押的人。
    在退出平壤以前，美、李匪军极力在居民之中散播恐慌，传布荒诞无稽的谣言，说中国共产党军队即将到达，他们将把平壤居民杀得一个不留，平壤将被投以原子弹等等。
    他们用吓诈威胁的手段，强迫居民迁到大同江南岸去。并声称：谁要是不撤出城市者便被目为“赤色”分子，并予以镇压。
    受到恐吓的居民——男男女女，在十二月三日、四日开始大规模地从桥上，或者，坐在船上，木桶上，木板上渡过大同江。但是当大群居民正在过桥时，败退的美、李匪军就把桥炸断了。同时许多美国喷气飞机又用机枪向岸上和正在渡江的人群扫射。
    在十二月三、四两天，美、李匪军就这样屠杀了约四千个绝对无辜的平壤居民。目睹者说：十二月四日，大同江上浮满了死尸，死者的血使江水染成了红色。
    美、李匪军借口朝鲜爱国分子利用防空壕作为自己反抗美、李匪军的基地，强使居民用土填塞防空壕，并将躲在防空壕里的人杀死。在平壤西区的八个防空壕里发现了被此种方法杀死的居民尸体共达三百二十八具。
    每天，都不经法庭审讯，枪杀着被控以：“同情共产党”罪名的居民，像这样被杀害的有住在平壤市雪水里（译音）五十六号住宅的公民李文，住在平壤市雪水里（译音）十区的教授文盲学生的教员崔成勤（译音），住在平壤市西城里的公民韩镐成（译音），平壤工业专科学校教员文相泰（译音）及其他许多人。
    美、李匪军在占领平壤期间曾强奸了大批妇女。
    只引证几个例子：
    十月二十五日，敌人用手枪威胁着，强奸了住在平壤上水里，年仅十八岁的朴秋玉。
    在甘兴一里大韩青年团的办公室里，美国人强奸了两个家庭主妇和一个少女，并强奸了公民朴明镐的妻子。
    李东岩的妻子（三十二岁），住平壤东昌里被五个美国人轮奸。崔兴石（译音）的妻子被两个美国兵轮奸。连李崇坤五十四岁的妻子，也被两个美国人轮奸。
    住于上兴里四号的公民赵承诺被逮捕，过了三天，三个美国兵去强奸了他的妻子。美国军队逮捕了许多爱国志士的妻子，把她们关在源泉里及寺洞二里，昼夜不息地蹂躏她们。
    美、李匪军悍然破坏关于战俘与伤兵的日内瓦公约，虐待和杀害被俘的人民军战士。例如，美国军队曾在平壤城东区七佛里枪杀了约七十名被俘的人民军战士，又在尤里（译音）二里枪杀了五十人。被囚于平壤纺织厂原址上的战俘们，在寒冷的十一月的天气里还在露天过夜，伤号和病号没有得到任何医药治疗，他们之中许多人因而死去。
    二、破坏工业设备，建筑物及文化机关。
    在暂时占领平壤之后，美、李匪军工兵特种部队于撤出此城时，炸坏并烧毁了平壤市内的工业企业、建筑物。
    在退出平壤以前，美、李匪军破坏了平壤化学工厂的一切设备，烧毁了工厂厂房同宿舍，在轰炸中残存下来的平壤纺织工厂，东平壤机器制造工厂、寺洞炼炭厂及其发电站、平壤毛巾厂、平壤卫生衣制造厂、平壤制糖厂、平壤灯泡制造厂、唱片制造厂、制针厂、平壤制烟厂、龙山化学工厂平壤中央百货商店等等的设备同房屋都被彻底破坏了。
    美、李匪军完全破坏了共和国北部人民亲手建筑起来的金日成大学、俄语大学、师范大学、邮政专门学校、工业大学、劳动党中央党校、第一高级中学、第二高级中学、第二、第三、第四、第五、第十初级中学，第二女子高级中学校、第五女子初级中学校、第十四、十九、三十八、三十九小学，教学参考书和家具或被浇以汽油焚毁或被用作燃料。
    他们同时也炸坏、烧毁了中央医院、国立艺术剧院、平壤儿童宫、《劳动新闻》报社编辑部及其他文化机关。
    美、李匪帮将国立中央图书馆、金日成大学图书馆，其他机关图书馆、书店及私人图书馆的几十万卷藏书付诸一炬；他们破坏了平壤博物馆打碎了那里的陈列品，销毁了许多历史纪念物：例如乐浪时代的墓碑，朝鲜八大古迹之一的浮碧楼，抢去了永明寺中佛像的金边。
    美国侵略者并炸毁和破坏了供给四十万平壤居民饮水的自来水总管和贮水池，供给平壤城电气的电力站，彻底破坏了横跨大同江的火车铁桥与人行桥，以及该城的电车路线网。
    美、李匪军破坏了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会内阁、内务部、司法部的建筑物，平壤市人民委员会内务部部长的官邸、平壤电讯电话局、中央银行、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会，北朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会及其他的大建筑物。
    三、劫掠人民财产
    美、李匪军在占领平壤时不仅抢劫国家机关、企业、仓库及消费合作社联合会仓库中的财物，而且也抢劫私人仓库、企业及居民住宅中的财物。
    为美、李匪军逮捕的人员的家属一律被赶出住屋，他们所有的财产也被匪军抢去。
    喝醉酒的美国兵经常闯入居民住宅抢劫最贵重的东西。例如闯入平壤城东昌里金根连家里的美国兵抢去了他妻子手上的两个金戒指；另一个闯入甘兴里金德三家里的美国兵抢去了表，闯入上兴里沈容九家的美国兵抢去了四十包大米，一只猪，一架缝纫机三床毯子和一千把窝炬及其他财产；从甘兴里赵时民、金鸾俊、全玄德、吴龙益、张基善及朴基善的家中，李承晚匪军一共抢去了一百五十八包大米、六只猪、两只牡牛、和二百多坪地的蔬菜；闯入南区正平里碾米场全凤云家中的美国兵，殴打了这个住宅的主人，抢去了价值七千万元（朝鲜币）的黄金和其他贵重东西。
    在七佛里村，美、李匪军抢去了六只牡牛，七十只猪、两百只鸡。
    美、李匪军所犯的暴行，引起了朝鲜人民对侵略者及其朝鲜帮凶李承晚匪帮的极大愤怒。
    调查委员会将上述事实提起朝鲜人民及世界舆论的注意，并坚信世界上一切爱好和平的人民一定会谴责外国侵略者及朝鲜反动派在联合国旗帜下所犯的这种暴行。
                                      一九五○年十二月二十六日
