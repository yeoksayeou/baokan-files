To the Editor:

　　The article "Wafangdian Locomotive Depot Repair Shop Leadership Lacks Production Planning, Overtime Work Makes Workers Sick," published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" page on January 24, 1951, is completely accurate. We sincerely accept Comrade Mingming's criticism and offer the following self-criticism:

　　The mistake of causing workers to become sick due to overtime work in our depot in December 1950 was mainly due to the lack of scientific planning by the leading cadres. According to the fixed number of personnel in our depot in December, we could complete the cleaning and inspection of 18 locomotives. However, the leading cadres did not consider the actual situation and added the task of cleaning and inspecting eight more locomotives. At the same time, our depot is a cleaning and inspection repair depot and should not perform major overhauls. At that time, due to the heavy transportation workload and insufficient locomotive turnover, the depot chief and the assistant depot chief for maintenance convened relevant workshop-level cadres and above to study the matter. They then blindly requested approval from the bureau to perform a major overhaul on locomotive No. 290 ourselves, without going through democratic discussions with the workers or accepting the task based on our actual capabilities. At the same time, the leading cadres failed to effectively mobilize the staff and workers to discuss scientific methods for improving production; they simply ordered the workers to work overtime. The most serious issue was that on December 15, there were five locomotives undergoing maintenance simultaneously. They also failed to come up with timely solutions to such a heavy workload. All of this is enough to demonstrate that our leading cadres suffer from serious subjectivism and bureaucratic work styles, detached from reality and the masses. In addition, in the transportation system, the crews for 18 locomotives were used to complete the tasks of 26 locomotives. Due to insufficient personnel, the contracted crew system became a mixed rotation system, weakening the protection of the locomotives. Furthermore, the quality of locomotive maintenance was poor, which caused a sharp increase in accidents. In December alone, there were 12 responsibility accidents, causing unnecessary and enormous losses to people's property and greatly harming the health of the workers. In particular, our trade union cadres lost the due position of the trade union and failed to seriously protect the interests of the workers. They only one-sidedly recognized that the trade union should ensure the completion of production tasks, while turning a blind eye to the phenomenon of overtime work seriously harming the workers' health, resulting in losses of both people and property. This mistake of only caring about production and not caring about the workers' health has seriously taught us a lesson.

　　The Dalian Branch of the Changchun Railway recently sent a work team to help us review our past mistakes, determine new methods, specifically solve the problem of staff shortage due to excessive workload, reallocate cadres, and rectify labor discipline. Now, the phenomenon of blind overtime work has been completely corrected, the quality of locomotive cleaning and inspection has been greatly improved, and responsibility accidents have been reduced by 90 percent.

### 中长路瓦房店机务段工会  对生产缺乏计划加班加点的检讨

　　中长路瓦房店机务段工会
    对生产缺乏计划加班加点的检讨
    编辑同志：
    一九五一年一月二十四日贵报读者来信专页所载《瓦房店机务段修理厂领导生产缺乏计划加班加点累病工人》一稿，完全属实。我们诚恳接受明明同志的批评，并作如下检讨：
    我段在一九五○年十二月份造成加班加点累病工人的错误，主要是由于领导干部对工作缺乏科学的计划。我段十二月份按定员人数，可完成十八台机车的洗检任务。但领导干部不考虑实际情况，又增加了八台机车的任务。同时，我段是洗检修理段，不应作甲检修理。当时因运输业务繁忙，机车周转不暇，如去他段进行甲检，恐延误日期影响机车运用，段长与检修助理段长召集了有关工长级以上干部参加研究后，即盲目请局批准，冂二九○号机车自行甲检，并未经过工人民主讨论及根据实际力量来接受任务。同时领导干部又未能很好地发动职工，讨论提高生产的科学办法；只是简单地命令工人加班加点。最严重的是，在十二月十五日一天同时就有五台机车检修，如此繁重任务，也未能及时想办法解决。这都足以说明我们领导干部存在着严重的脱离实际，脱离群众的主观主义与官僚主义作风。另外在运输系统，则以十八台车的乘务人员来完成二十六台机车的任务。由于人员不足，就使包乘制变成了混杂轮乘制，减弱了对机车的保护。再加以机车检修质量不好，因此造成事故大增，十二月份仅责任事故就出了十二件，使人民财产受到不应有的巨大损失，职工的身体也受到很大损害。特别是我们工会干部，失去了工会应有的立场，未能认真保护职工的利益，只是片面的认识到工会应该保证生产任务的完成；对于加班加点严重损害工人健康的现象，却熟视无睹，结果是人财两伤。这种只顾生产，不顾工人健康的错误，已严重地教训了我们。
    中长路大连分局，不久前曾派来工作组，帮助我们检讨了过去的错误，定出新的办法，并具体解决了活多人少的缺员问题，重新调配了干部，整顿了劳动纪律。现在，盲目加班加点的现象已完全纠正，机车洗检质量已大为提高，责任事故已减少了百分之九十。
