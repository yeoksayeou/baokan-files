Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th: Regarding the issue of convening a conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement to eliminate German militarism, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, the United States, and Great Britain again on December 30, 1950. On January 23 of this year, the governments of France, the United States, and Great Britain sent similar replies to the Soviet government. The replies from the three governments reiterated that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference should "negotiate all issues that may threaten world peace" instead of "merely discussing issues related to Austria and Germany." The replies requested the Soviet government to clarify whether it agreed to discuss issues other than those related to Germany and Austria, but did not specify what these issues were. The replies reiterated that the Prague Declaration of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other eight countries on the German issue "cannot be accepted as the limit or basis for the Four-Power talks," and insisted that "the current tension is not caused by the German issue." The replies suggested holding a preparatory meeting of the four countries' representatives in Paris, but maintained that the preparatory meeting should "study the issues mentioned above in order to find a basis for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that can be accepted by all parties, and submit appropriate agendas to their governments."

On February 5th, the Soviet government sent a note to the French government regarding the aforementioned replies, and also sent notes with similar content to the governments of the United States and Great Britain. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on February 7th, the Soviet government's note to the French government stated:

	I. The implementation of the Potsdam Agreement's decision to eliminate German militarism and to eliminate differences in the attitudes of the four powers on this issue is of utmost importance in alleviating the current international tension, and undoubtedly will greatly promote the improvement of relations between France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United States, and Great Britain in New York in September 1950, and the measures subsequently taken by the three governments, are indeed aimed at rebuilding a regular German army in West Germany and greatly expanding armaments in Europe and the United States, thereby causing more panic among the people who have just suffered the hardships and disasters of the Second World War. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government proposed as early as November 3rd of last year to convene a foreign ministers conference to discuss the issue of eliminating German militarism. Since the French government, as well as the British and American governments, also declared their hope for a lasting improvement in the relations between France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and their hope to eliminate the causes of the current international tension, the Soviet government believes that under these circumstances, there is no reason to delay the convening of the foreign ministers conference any longer.

	II. Following the New York meeting of the three foreign ministers which raised the issue of rebuilding German armed forces and restoring West German war industries, the governments of France, the United States, and Great Britain have been engaged in extensive negotiations with the Adenauer government in Bonn for more than a month. Eisenhower's negotiations with the Adenauer government on incorporating the re-established German army into the so-called "unified army," and the current appointment of Eisenhower as the supreme commander of this armed force, are completely inconsistent with the official statements of wanting peace. Extreme militarists and revanchists, yesterday's servants of Hitler, are raising their heads in West Germany. In several countries in Europe and the United States, arms expansion and the arms race are being carried out very actively. These facts greatly increase the tension in the international situation and the concerns of various countries. Not only has the elimination of German militarism not been realized, but on the contrary, measures are being implemented in West Germany to restore the German regular army and war industries, as well as many other measures to accelerate preparations for a new war. If this situation continues, the foreign ministers conference will obviously face a fait accompli. The Soviet government has stated that it adopts a negative attitude towards this policy of fait accompli. This policy may be in line with the purposes of certain aggressive blocs, but the Soviet government must call attention to the intolerability of the situation that has occurred.

	III. The French government stated in its note that it believes it is necessary to request clarification on certain issues mentioned in the previous note from the Soviet Union, especially whether the Soviet government agrees to discuss other issues besides the issue of eliminating German militarism, although this time the French government did not specifically mention what those issues are. The Soviet government believes that it is also possible to discuss other issues at the foreign ministers conference, but it must be remembered that these issues should be discussed by the foreign ministers conference in accordance with the composition and procedures stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France.

	Regarding the French government's statement that it cannot accept the Prague Declaration as the basis for discussion, the Soviet government has explained its attitude on this issue in its note of December 30, 1950. Naturally, the Soviet government's starting point is that all participating countries in the foreign ministers conference have equal rights to submit any proposals related to issues that the conference has agreed to consider to the foreign ministers conference for discussion.

	IV. The Soviet government's attitude on the issue raised by the French government in its note of January 23 regarding the tasks of the preparatory meeting of the four countries' representatives was also explained in its note of December 30, 1950. The Soviet government believes that the preparatory meeting of the representatives of France, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union should be limited to drafting the agenda, which includes determining the order of the issues to be discussed. Therefore, the task of the preliminary meeting should not include discussing the substance of the various issues included in the agenda.

	V. The Soviet government does not object to holding a preparatory meeting of the four countries' representatives in Paris.

　　关于召开四国外长会议问题
    苏联政府再度照会法美英政府
    【新华社八日讯】莫斯科讯：苏联政府于一九五○年十二月三十日曾就召开苏、美、英、法四国外长会议，讨论关于履行波茨坦协定以肃清德国军国主义的问题再度照会法、美、英三国政府。今年一月二十三日，法、美、英三国政府以内容相似的复文送致苏联政府。三国政府的复文重复主张四国外长会议应“谈判一切可能威胁全世界和平的问题”，而不是“仅仅要讨论与奥地利和德国有关的问题”。复文请求苏联政府阐释是否同意讨论除了与德国和奥地利有关的问题之外的其他问题，但是，并未说明这些问题是指那些问题。复文再度声明，苏、波、捷等八国关于德国问题的布拉格声明，“不能被接受为四强会谈的限度或基础”，并且硬说：“目前的紧张局势并不是因为德国问题而引起的”。复文建议在巴黎举行四国代表的预备会议，但主张预备会议应“研究上面指出的问题，以期觅致能够共同接受的四国外长会议的基础，并向他们的政府提出适当的议程”。
    二月五日，苏联政府就上述复文照会法国政府，又以内容相似的照会送致美、英两国政府。据塔斯社莫斯科七日电，苏联政府致法国政府的照会称：
    一、履行波茨坦协定关于肃清德国军国主义的决定与消除四国在这一问题上的态度的分歧，对于减轻目前国际紧张局势具有最大的重要性，而且，无疑地会大大促进法、英、美、苏之间关系的改善。但是，法、美、英外长于一九五○年九月在纽约举行的会议以及嗣后三国政府所采取的措施，其目的，确实在于在西德重建正规的德国军队并在欧洲和美国大事扩张军备，以致在那些刚刚遭受过第二次世界大战的苦难和灾害的人民中间引起更多的惊恐。正是为了这个缘故，苏联政府早在去年十一月三日，就建议召开外长会议，讨论肃清德国军国主义的问题。由于法国政府以及英国和美国政府也声明希望法、英、美、苏之间的关系能有持久的改善，并希望消除造成目前国际紧张局势的原因，苏联政府认为在这种情况下，再延迟召开外长会议，是毫无理由的。
    二、继纽约三国外长会议提出了重建德国武装部队和恢复西德战争工业的问题之后，法、美、英三国政府与阿登纳的波恩政府之间，进行广泛的谈判已有一个多月之久。艾森豪威尔与阿登纳政府谈判关于把重新建立起来的德国军队并入所谓“统一军队”，以及恰在目前任命艾森豪威尔为这支武装部队最高统帅一事，是和关于希望和平的官方声明完全不相符合的。极端的军国主义分子与复仇主义分子，昨日的希特勒的仆从们，正在西德抬头。在欧洲若干国家和美国，扩军和军备竞赛都正在非常积极地进行。这种事实，大大增加了国际局势的紧张与各国的忧虑。肃清德国的军国主义不仅还没有实现，而且相反，在西德正在实施着恢复德国正规军及战争工业的措施，以及其他许多加速新战争准备的措施。如果这种局势继续下去，则外长会议显然将会面临既成事实。苏联政府已经声明，它对这种既成事实政策采取否定态度。这种政策可能符合于某些侵略集团的目的，但是，苏联政府不得不唤起注意已发生的局势的不可容忍。
    三、法国政府在其照会中说，它认为有必要要求阐释苏联以前的照会中所提到的某些问题，特别是苏联政府除了肃清德国军国主义的问题以外，是否同意还讨论其他的问题，虽然这一次法国政府也没有明确地谈到是指的那些问题。苏联政府认为在外长会议上讨论其他的问题也是可能的，但要记住，这些问题应由外长会议按照苏、美、英、法四国波茨坦协定所规定的组成与程序予以讨论。
    关于法国政府所称不能接受布拉格声明作为讨论的基础，苏联政府已在一九五○年十二月三十日的照会中说明了它对这个问题的态度。很自然地，苏联政府的出发点是：外长会议的所有与会国都有平等的权利，将任何有关会议已同意考虑的问题的建议，提交外长会议讨论。
    四、法国政府在一月二十三日的照会中提出有关四国代表预备会议的任务的问题，苏联政府在这个问题上的态度，也在一九五○年十二月三十日的照会中有所说明。苏联政府认为，法、美、英、苏四国代表的预备会议，应该限于草拟议程，其中包括拟定所要讨论的问题的次序。因此，初步会议的任务不应包括讨论列入议程的各项问题的实质。
    五、苏联政府并不反对在巴黎举行四国代表预备会议。
