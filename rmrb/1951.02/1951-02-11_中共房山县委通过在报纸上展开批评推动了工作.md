　　The CPC Fangshan County Committee Promoted Work by Launching Criticism in Newspapers
　　Song Guangkuan, Xin Tuo
    Last April, after the Party Central Committee published the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," the Fangshan County Committee of Hebei Province immediately launched this work.

    The Fangshan County Committee first discussed this decision. Leading party member cadres from various departments were included in the discussion. Subsequently, a report was made at an expanded cadre meeting throughout the county. The County Committee also entrusted the County Committee Propaganda Department with specific leadership of this work.

    In implementing the spirit of this decision, the County Committee paid attention to dispelling cadres' fears of criticism, fear of trouble, fear of losing prestige by being criticized, fear of retaliation, and fear of bad elements taking advantage. The way to resolve these ideological concerns was mainly to mobilize cadres to study documents in connection with practical work. Comrade Du Enlin, the county magistrate of the county (and a member of the County Committee), was criticized by the People's Daily and the Hebei Daily for neglecting tax collection work. After studying the matter, the County Committee decided that Comrade Du Enlin should conduct a self-criticism at the expanded cadre meeting throughout the county. This was of great educational significance to the cadres throughout the county. Many cadres were enlightened and said, "Even the county magistrate is not afraid of criticism, what are we afraid of? It's right to correct mistakes after being criticized." Many cadres realized, "In the past, in the environment of struggle against the enemy, we were not afraid to sacrifice our lives for the people and the Party, so what are we afraid of now when it comes to criticism?!"

    The Fangshan County Committee also consciously paid attention to implementing the spirit of this decision in practical work.

    On July 11th last year, the Tongxian Special District approved 60,000 catties of relief grain to the seriously affected Sixth District of the county. The Finance Section of the County Government prepared the allocation certificate on the 15th, and the next day handed the letter notifying the Sixth District to collect grain from the county granary to the post office. It was only a distance of ninety li, but the post office held it up for ten days before delivering the grain collection notice to the Sixth District. This caused the disaster victims who had no food and no strength to carry out summer hoeing to receive relief grain eight days late, thus affecting the summer hoeing. In addition, the post office had also delayed meeting notices, affecting cadres' attendance at meetings. More serious was the problem of holding up newspapers. The post office received the newspapers the day after they were published, but Zhenjiangying and other villages, seventy li away from the county seat, did not see the newspapers until eight to ten days later. In July last year, the Sixth Joint Village in the Third District only saw four copies of the Hebei Daily. These problems were written into a letter of criticism by the County Committee correspondent and published in the Hebei Daily. The Fangshan County Committee supported this criticism and criticized the Party Group of the post office, helping them make a self-criticism, which was sent to the Hebei Daily. The post office also examined many other problems in the self-criticism. The Hebei Daily published the self-criticism of Comrade Dong Jingyu, the director of the post office. The Fangshan County Committee also sent people to help the Party Group of the post office to make a specific plan for improving work, and as a result, the post office's work took on a new look. This fact educated all the cadres in Fangshan, and many cadres reflected, "Launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is a magic weapon for promoting work. The post office improved its work after being criticized, and we can now see the newspapers on time."

    On the October 26th issue of the Hebei Daily last year, a report by correspondents Wang Xingyuan and others on the Fangshan County People's Court's handling of counter-attacks by landlords was published. Because the sentences were too light, the newspaper editors added a note suggesting that the Fangshan People's Court should re-sentence. This correct suggestion was ignored by the Fangshan County People's Court for a month. The County Committee sent people to urge the Party Group of the County Government to handle it three times, but no results were obtained. The County Committee Propaganda Department immediately notified all Party organizations in the county of this incident, so that the Party Group of the County Government re-processed it through administration according to the newspaper's opinion. This not only improved the work, but also educated all Party members and cadres that they must pay attention to the criticism and suggestions in the newspapers.

    In order to implement the spirit of this decision in the villages, the County Committee sent people to assist the District Committee to conduct education on opposing commandism and the mass line to the Party members of Beizheng Village, which usually had a more serious style of commandism. The District Committee first conducted a self-criticism, and inspired Party members to conduct self-criticism. The self-criticism of Comrade Huang Deyuan, the secretary of the branch, was published in the Hebei Daily on August 16th. After Huang Deyuan's relatives and friends saw the newspaper, they secretly found Huang Deyuan and said, "Why don't you hide? You're in the newspaper, saying you tie people up, beat people, and force orders." Huang Deyuan smiled and explained to them, "The newspaper published it to prevent these mistakes from being made elsewhere, and I will correct my mistakes after my personal self-criticism!" When the county held a people's representative meeting, the County Committee convened a meeting of Party members among the representatives, and Huang Deyuan reported on this matter. Many branch leaders asked the county and district committees to help them conduct self-criticisms.

    Because the Fangshan County Party Organization consciously implemented the central government's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" according to the actual situation, it brought into play the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people. From May to September last year, in addition to the letters sent directly by the masses to various newspapers, the County Committee also directly received 104 letters from the masses (including inquiries and criticisms). The County Committee correctly handled these letters. In addition to forwarding policy-related letters to the newspapers, the remaining individual issues were handled and answered by the relevant departments. Anonymous letters have gradually decreased in the letters received, proving that the masses have begun to get rid of their worries. On the other hand, it also prompted cadres to strengthen their policy learning, and their work gradually became more in-depth and cautious.

### 中共房山县委通过在报纸上展开批评推动了工作

　　中共房山县委通过在报纸上展开批评推动了工作
　　宋广宽、辛拓
    去年四月，党中央公布“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”后，河北省房山县委会立刻开展了这一工作。
    房山县委会首先讨论了这一决定。讨论时并吸收了各部门的党员负责干部参加；随后又在全县扩大干部会上作了报告。县委并把这一工作委托给县委宣传部具体领导。
    在贯彻这一决定精神中，县委注意了解除干部中的怕批评、怕麻烦、怕受批评丧失威信、怕报复、怕坏分子钻空子等思想。解决这些思想顾虑的办法，主要是发动干部联系实际学习文件。该县县长杜恩霖同志（县委委员）曾因为轻视税收工作，受到了人民日报及河北日报的批评。县委会研究结果，决定要杜恩霖同志在全县扩大干部会议上进行自我检讨。这对全县党员干部有很大教育意义。很多干部得到启示说：“县长都不怕批评，咱们有什么怕的，批评了改正那就对了。”不少干部认识到：“过去在对敌斗争的环境中，咱们为了人民为了党，连性命都不怕牺牲，现在又有什么怕批评的呢？！”
    房山县委并有意识的注意从实际工作中，贯彻这一决定精神。
    去年七月十一日，通县专署批准给该县重灾区六区六万斤救济粮，县府财政科十五日开好拨付证，第二天把通知六区来县粮库领粮的信交给邮局。只有九十里地的路程，但是邮局却积压了十天才把领粮通知送到六区。这样使无口粮而无力进行夏锄的灾民，晚得了八天救济粮，因而影响了夏锄。此外邮局还有过因积压开会的通知，影响了干部参加会议的事情。更严重的是积压报纸的问题。邮局在报纸出版的第二天就收到报纸了，而离县城七十里地的镇江营等村，却需要八到十天后才见到报纸。三区六合庄去年七月份只见到四份河北日报。这些问题被县委通讯干事写成批评信发表在河北日报上，房山县委支持了这一批评，并向邮局党组提出批评，帮助他们作了检讨送到河北日报。邮局在检讨中，还检查出好多问题。河北日报上发表了邮局局长董景玉同志的自我检讨，房山县委又派人帮助邮局党组作了改进工作的具体计划，结果邮局工作面貌一新。这个事实教育了房山全体干部，不少干部反映：“在报纸上展开批评和自我批评是推动工作的法宝，邮局受了批评，改进了工作，咱们也能按时看到报纸了。”
    去年十月二十六日的河北日报上，发表了通讯员王兴元等关于房山县人民法院处理地主反攻案件的报道，因为处刑太轻，报社编辑同志加上了按语，建议房山人民法院重新判处。这一正确的建议被房山县人民法院置之不理达一月之久；县委派人三次督促县府党组处理，也未获结果。县委宣传部即向全县党组织通报了这一事件，使县府党组重新根据报纸意见通过行政进行处理。这样不仅改进了工作，也教育了全党党员干部必须重视报纸上的批评与建议。
    为了把这一决定精神贯彻到村，县委派人协助区委，到平常存有命令主义作风较严重的北郑村，对支部党员进行了反对命令主义及群众路线的教育。并首先由区委作了自我检讨，启发党员作自我批评。支部书记黄德元同志的检讨，发表在八月十六日的河北日报上。黄德元的亲戚朋友见到报纸后，都暗暗的找到黄德元说：“你还不躲躲，报纸上都登了你了，说你捆人打人强迫命令。”黄德元笑着向他们解释说：“报纸上登了是为了不叫别处再犯这些错误，我个人检讨了以后还要改正错误呢！”趁着县里开人民代表会时，县委召集了代表中的党员会议，黄德元报告了这件事。不少支部负责同志都要求县、区委去帮助他们进行检讨。
    由于房山县党组织根据实际情况有意识的贯彻执行了中央“在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评”的决定，发挥了广大干部、群众的政治热情。自去年五月到九月，除群众直接寄到各报社的信件在外，县委还直接收到群众投书（包括询问事项与批评）一百零四件。县委正确的处理了这些来信，除把带有政策性的信件转交报社外，其余个别问题均交有关部门解决和答复。来信中匿名信已逐渐减少，证明群众已开始去掉顾虑。另一方面，也促使了干部加强自己的政策学习，工作逐渐走向深入、慎重。
