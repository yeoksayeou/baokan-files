　　Suggestion: Do Not Overuse Abbreviations
    Editor:
    In our work, we often use many nouns, such as "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country," which are already concise. However, some comrades often abbreviate these nouns further, to the point where the meaning becomes unclear and difficult for everyone to understand, which is very bad. In a report, I saw the sentence "It is necessary to unfold 'abolish-establish' work." I really didn't understand what this work referred to. After careful study, I realized that it meant: "Abolish the old baojia system and establish a new regime." The comrade who wrote the report initially abbreviated this noun as "abolish baojia establish government," and then further abbreviated it to "abolish-establish" work. This really makes no sense. For example, our general cadres do not participate in family production, and their living expenses are provided by the public. This is customarily called "separating from production." However, some comrades write: "Most of our cadres are 'separated-production'," which is incomprehensible. Some comrades also abbreviates "Support the government and cherish the people, support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers movement" as "double-support movement," which loses the specific content. Our methods for dealing with rumors include "explaining, refuting, pursuing, and handling." "Explaining" refers to publicizing current events and policies, but in a news item in the Jinan Dazhong Daily on January 6th, "Yantai Holds People's Representative Conference," it said: "It is necessary to actively 'explain, refute, pursue, and handle' rumors." Using the word "explain" in conjunction with "rumors" is completely wrong. I hope that everyone will no longer casually use these ambiguous abbreviations.

### 建议不要滥用简词

　　建议不要滥用简词
    编辑同志：
    我们工作中常用许多名词，如“抗美援朝，保家卫国”等，本来就是简单扼要的。但有些同志常常将这些名词再省略一次，以至含义不清，使大家看不懂，这是很不好的。我在一个报告中见到有“要展开‘废建’工作”一句，我实在不懂这是指的什么工作，仔细研究，才知道是：“废除旧保甲，建立新政权”。写报告的同志第一次曾把这个名词省略成：“废保建政”以后更省略成“废建”工作了，这实在是没有道理的。又如：我们一般干部都不参加家中的生产，生活由公家供给，习惯上叫做：“脱离生产”。但有的同志写道：“我们的干部大部都是‘脱产’的”，这就不知是怎么一回事了。也有同志把“拥政爱民，拥军优属运动”再简为“双拥运动”，这样就失去了具体内容。我们对待谣言的办法有“讲、驳、追、办”四种，讲是指宣传时事和政策，但一月六日济南大众日报“烟台召开各界人民代表会议”一条新闻中说：“要积极‘讲、驳、追、办’谣言”这“讲”字连着“谣言”一起用，就十分错误了。我希望大家再不要随便用这些含意不清的简词。
