Xinhua News Agency, February 24th dispatch: Summarized TASS reports: Newspapers in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria continue to comment on Stalin's interview with a Pravda reporter. The February 20th editorial of the Polish newspaper *Warsaw Daily* pointed out: Stalin's speech is a great contribution to defending peace and a devastating blow to imperialists. On February 21st, *Scânteia*, the organ of the Romanian Workers' Party, published an editorial titled *A Brilliant Program of Action for Defending Peace*, stating: What the great Stalin said, that war is not inevitable, is of very great significance to all mankind. *Scânteia* called on all honest people to follow Stalin's brilliant instructions and disseminate them as widely as possible among the working people, because these instructions illuminate the path to new victories in the struggle to defend peace.

On February 21st, *Rabotnichesko Delo*, the organ of the Bulgarian Communist Party, commented: While the imperialist camp is stepping up its preparations for war, the great Stalin, with brilliant clarity and insight, pointed out a way out of the current tense international situation. The newspaper *Otechestven Front* wrote: For the people who defend peace, Comrade Stalin's words are a program of action and a source of strength. In order to attract more people to participate in the struggle to defend peace, it is necessary to carry out extensive explanatory work among people of all strata. On February 20th, *Izgrev* commented: Stalin's speech clearly and correctly pointed out the source of the threat to peace and how to avoid this threat. *Trud*, in an article titled *The Voice of World Conscience*, stated: Stalin has very clearly determined the outcome of the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of aggression. American imperialism is very wrong to think that the docile majority they have in the United Nations represents the people of the world. The camp of peace unites all peoples, and they will do everything in their power to fight against war instigators and defend peace and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th dispatch: According to a Vietnam News Agency report: "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast a commentary on February 22nd discussing Marshal Stalin's interview with a Pravda reporter. The commentary pointed out: Stalin's speech pointed out a correct path for mankind. The commentary stated: Stalin's speech further strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in striving for peace; it reminded the people of all countries that the Soviet Union, the world's most powerful country, unswervingly supports the cause of peace and constantly brings great strength to maintaining peace. The commentary concluded: The Vietnamese people are determined to eliminate the French imperialists and defeat the American interventionists on Vietnamese territory in order to liberate their motherland. The Vietnamese people have learned from the example of the heroic Chinese and Korean people and will fight even harder in order to win greater victories in 1951.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS London, February 23rd: The *Daily Worker* reported that the British-Soviet Friendship Society has printed Stalin's interview with a Pravda reporter in its entirety as a pamphlet for distribution.

Matthew, Assistant General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, said: "Stalin's speech is of historic importance in the struggle for peace. The press and government propagandists, fearing the impact Stalin's words will have on those who read the full text of the interview, are doing their best to conceal and distort the meaning of these words."

　　斯大林谈话是行动纲领
　  应在人民中广泛传播
　  波、罗、保、越报纸拥护斯大林谈话
    【新华社二十四日讯】综合塔斯社消息：波、罗、保三国报纸继续评论斯大林对真理报记者的谈话。二十日波兰《华沙报》的社论指出：斯大林的谈话是对保卫和平的巨大贡献，是对帝国主义者的毁灭性的打击。二十一日罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》以《天才的保卫和平的行动纲领》为题发表社论称：伟大的斯大林所说的战争并不是不可避免，对全人类具有非常重大的意义。《火花报》号召一切诚实的人们遵照斯大林的天才的指示，尽可能广泛地在劳动人民中间加以传播，因为这些指示照明了在保卫和平的斗争中走向新的胜利的道路。
    二十一日保加利亚共产党机关报《工人事业报》评称：当帝国主义阵营正加紧准备战争的时候，伟大的斯大林以天才的明确性和洞察力给目前紧张的国际形势指出了一条出路。《祖国阵线》报写道：对于保卫和平的人民，斯大林同志的话是行动的纲领和力量的源泉。为了吸引更多的人民参加保卫和平的斗争，就必须在各阶层人民中间展开广泛的解释工作。二十日《伊兹格列夫报》评称：斯大林的谈话明晰而正确地指出了和平的威胁的根源，以及怎样才能避免这种威胁。《劳动报》在以《世界良心的呼声》为题的文章中称：斯大林已很清楚地确定了和平势力与侵略势力斗争的结果。美帝国主义极为错误地以为他们在联合国组织中所拥有的温驯的多数代表着全世界人民。和平阵营团结着各族人民，他们将竭尽全力为反对战争挑拨者，维护和平、民主而斗争。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台二十二日发表广播评论，论斯大林大元帅对真理报记者的谈话。评论指出：斯大林的谈话给人类指出了一条正确的道路。评论称：斯大林的谈话进一步加强了世界各国人民对争取和平的信心；它提醒各国人民：世界最强大的国家苏联，毫不动摇地拥护和平事业，并且经常地拿出巨大力量来维护和平。评论末称：越南人民已下决心要在越南领土上消灭法帝国主义者并击败美国干涉者，以解放自己的祖国。越南人民学习了英勇的中国和朝鲜人民的榜样，将更奋力作战，以便在一九五一年赢得更大的胜利。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦二十三日电：工人日报报道，英苏友好协会将斯大林对真理报记者的谈话全文刊印成小册子散发。
    英国共产党助理总书记马修斯说：“斯大林的谈话在争取和平的斗争中是具有历史重要性的。报界和政府宣传人员因为害怕斯大林的话将对那些阅读到谈话全文的人们发生影响，所以尽力掩盖与歪曲这些话的意义。”
