    World Federation of Trade Unions Issues Special Statement
    Condemning Illegal Decision by French Government
    All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions Chairman Kuznetsov Sends Telegram to French Government and United Nations Protesting

[Xinhua News Agency, February 4th] (TASS, Paris dispatch): The World Federation of Trade Unions issued the following special statement from Milan, Italy, on February 3rd regarding the French government's unreasonable prohibition of the World Federation of Trade Unions' activities in France:

    "The President and General Secretary and Secretaries of the World Federation of Trade Unions have held a meeting to consider the situation created after the French Minister of Interior ordered the prohibition of the World Federation of Trade Unions headquarters being located in France. The World Federation of Trade Unions is an international organization established according to the free will of trade union organizations from sixty-four countries, and no government is qualified to prohibit its activities. The World Federation of Trade Unions hereby declares on behalf of the universal opinion of the working people of the world that the Federation will continue to carry out the tasks determined at its founding in Paris in 1945.

    In order to realize social progress and welfare, strengthen mutual assistance and international solidarity among the working people, strengthen the friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries regardless of race, political views, and religious beliefs, and to maintain world peace, the world trade union organization of the working people is more important than ever before.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions does not recognize the French government's decision as legal. The World Federation of Trade Unions enjoys legal status with the United Nations, and this decision by the French government violates France's international obligations. Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions has decided to file a complaint with the qualified judicial institutions against the French government's decision.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convene a meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Warsaw on February 17th and 18th, and the Executive Bureau is the competent body to select the temporary headquarters of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions extends its sincere thanks to the French General Confederation of Labor and all the working people and people of France for the hospitality and assistance given to the World Federation of Trade Unions. The World Federation of Trade Unions also asks all trade union organizations to note that until the Executive Bureau makes a decision on the location of the headquarters, all correspondence should be sent to the President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, at Corso de Italia, Rome."

[Xinhua News Agency, February 4th] (TASS, Moscow, February 4th): Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to French President Auriol and Prime Minister Pleven, protesting the French government's decision to prohibit the headquarters of the World Federation of Trade Unions from being located in Paris. The telegram pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions' choice of Paris as its headquarters in 1945 was a sign of respect for the democratic traditions of the freedom-loving French people. The French government's decision brutally violates the democratic rights of the working people and the United Nations Charter. The All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions firmly demands that the French government revoke this unreasonable decision. Kuznetsov also sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, stating that the World Federation of Trade Unions is a Grade A consultative body of the United Nations, and the United Nations should guarantee its freedom of activity and demand that the French government revoke its decision that violates the United Nations Charter.

　　世界工联发表特别声明
    控诉法国政府非法决定       
    全苏工会主席库兹涅佐夫电法政府及联合国抗议
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界工会联合会于三日就法国政府无理禁止世界工联在法国活动事，自意大利的米兰发出特别声明如下：
    “世界工会联合会主席和总书记与书记曾举行会议，考虑了法国政府内政部长下令禁止世界工联总部设在法国的决定后所造成的形势。世界工联是根据六十四国工会组织的自由意志而成立的国际组织，任何政府都没有资格禁止它的活动。世界工联兹代表全世界劳动人民普遍的意见声明：本会将继续执行一九四五年在巴黎成立时所确定的任务。
    为了实现社会进步与福利，加强劳动人民的互助与国际团结，加强各国不分种族、政治主张与宗教信仰的人民的友好与合作，为了维持世界和平，劳动人民的世界工会组织比以往任何时候都更具有重要性。
    世界工联不承认法国政府的决定是合法的。世界工联享有联合国的合法地位，法国政府的这一决定是违反了法国所担负的国际义务。因此世界工联决定向合格的司法机构控诉法国政府的决定。
    世界工联已决定于二月十七、十八两日在华沙召开世界工联执行局会议，执行局是选择世界工联临时总部所在地的合格机关。世界工联书记处特对法国总工会和法国全体劳动者和人民所给予世界工联的款待和帮助，致恳切的谢意。世界工联并请各工会组织注意：在执行局对总部所在地未作决定之前，一切函件均寄交世界工联主席、意大利总工会总书记维多里奥，地址为罗马，科尔索·德意大利亚。”
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：全苏工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫致电法国总统阿里奥尔和总理普利文，抗议法国政府禁止世界工联总部设在巴黎的决定。电文指出，一九四五年世界工联选择在巴黎设立总部，是对爱好自由的法国人民的民主传统的尊敬。法国政府的决定粗暴地违反了劳动人民的民主权利和联合国宪章，全苏工会中央理事会坚决要求法国政府取消这一无理决定。库兹涅佐夫同时致电联合国秘书长赖伊称：世界工联是联合国的甲级谘询团体，联合国应保障其活动的自由，并要求法国政府取消它的违反联合国宪章的决定。
