　　Strive to Fulfill This Year's Agricultural and Forestry Production Tasks
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has issued instructions on agricultural and forestry production for 1951, setting targets for increased agricultural and forestry production and outlining the policies to be implemented to achieve these targets. This is of great significance to the current national economic construction.
    In 1950, both agricultural and forestry production achieved remarkable results. The production of grain and cotton exceeded the original plan, and significant progress was also made in afforestation. These achievements ensured the food and clothing needs of the people nationwide, supplied raw materials for industry, fundamentally reversed the decades-long dependence on imports for grain and cotton, increased farmers' purchasing power, expanded the capacity for agricultural reproduction, and revitalized the urban economy, providing favorable conditions for the recovery of industry and commerce nationwide. These achievements are an important foundation for the initial improvement of the national financial and economic situation.
    What was the main key to the success of agricultural production last year? In addition to the old liberated areas with a population of 160 million, where land reform had already been implemented, the implementation of rent reduction policies in the newly liberated areas, which generally increased farmers' enthusiasm for production, the launch of bandit suppression and anti-hegemony work in the new areas, which stabilized social order in the countryside, and the favorable weather conditions in more than half of the country, the economic and financial measures taken by the People's Government also played a significant role. These measures were: first, vigorously assisting farmers in water conservancy construction, pest and disease control, and prevention of livestock epidemics to overcome natural disasters; second, organizing and guiding farmers to improve farming techniques and increase agricultural productivity; third, developing and improving labor mutual aid organizations; and fourth, promulgating and implementing a series of policies to protect and reward agricultural production. For example, in terms of burden policy, it was stipulated that if production exceeded the required amount due to diligent farming and improved technology, the burden would not be increased; labor models were rewarded, and production was encouraged; in the new areas, the principle of "whoever plants, harvests" was implemented to protect the fruits of labor. In terms of agricultural financial policy, a large amount of agricultural loans was issued, focusing on helping poor farmers to carry out production and supporting the development of special products. Among this series of policies to protect and reward production, the most significant for agricultural production was the setting of reasonable in-kind price ratios for industrial raw material crops, as well as the government's policy of purchasing agricultural products. The price ratio between cotton and grain and between hemp and grain issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council in the spring of last year greatly encouraged farmers' production enthusiasm because it guaranteed their profits. The trade departments of the People's Government, under a reasonable price policy, extensively carried out purchasing work, minimizing the "scissors difference" between agricultural and industrial products as much as possible, fundamentally changing the phenomenon of sharp declines in agricultural product prices after the autumn harvest for many years. At the same time, cooperatives in various places not only cooperated with this purchasing work, but also promoted contracts with farmers in advance, eliminating farmers' concerns about production. All of this should be regarded as the most important encouragement for increasing agricultural production. The production of cotton last year, both in terms of sown area and actual yield, exceeded the original plan by more than 10 percent, which is the most powerful proof. The government's instructions on forest protection have also yielded obvious results.
    Agricultural and forestry production in 1951 has the foundation of the national agricultural harvest in 1950, the high tide of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and the completion of land reform in the new areas with a population of 130 million as favorable conditions. Therefore, the tasks of increasing grain production, increasing industrial raw material production, and afforestation, especially increasing the production of cotton, hemp, and tobacco, as stipulated in the State Council's instructions, are entirely achievable. In order to implement the spirit of the instructions and ensure the completion of the tasks, people's governments at all levels should pay attention to the following four requirements.
    First, China's current agricultural production, including handicrafts, accounts for about 90 percent of the entire national economy and plays a decisive role in the national economy. Therefore, local governments at all levels must take leading agricultural production as the central task throughout the year, and promote other work through this central link. As pointed out in the instructions, in the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, the people's governments at the county, district, and village levels are required to concentrate all their efforts on agricultural production; in areas where land reform is underway, efforts should be made to complete land reform before spring plowing so as to shift to full leadership of agricultural production without delaying the farming season; areas where land reform cannot be completed before spring plowing should also strive to bring it to a conclusion so as to concentrate efforts on leading spring plowing production and completing the sowing task. Land reform must not be delayed or affected due to land reform. Past experience has shown that not only in the old areas where land reform has been implemented is agricultural production the urgent demand of the broad masses, and other work must be promoted through this central link; but also the broad masses of farmers in the new areas urgently demand to improve production due to difficult living conditions, so other work can only be promoted and achieve twice the result with half the effort when combined with production. Any idea that ignores agricultural production, that leading agricultural production is only a matter for a few business departments, or that "farmers can produce and do not need leadership" is wrong and must be resolutely corrected.
    Second, the various production policies stipulated in the State Council's instructions are an important guarantee for mobilizing and consolidating farmers' enthusiasm for production. People's governments at all levels must conscientiously study them and conduct detailed propaganda and explanations to the masses repeatedly through various organizations (such as mass organizations, etc.), various meetings (such as people's representative conferences, cadre meetings, mass rallies, etc.), and various methods (such as proclamations, speeches, pictures, slogans, entertainment, etc.), so that they are known to every household and turn policies into the opinions and actions of the masses. The implementation of these policies should be constantly checked, models should be commended, deviations should be corrected, and the masses should be educated in this way. Propaganda work is an important weapon to ensure production, and we must be good at using this weapon to eliminate various ideological concerns of the masses and enable them to concentrate on production.
    Third, as indicated in the State Council's instructions, the important links for increasing agricultural production lie in organizing, overcoming natural disasters, improving production technology, building water conservancy projects, and increasing the production of cotton, tobacco, and hemp. For these, we must not only make general appeals, but also make specific arrangements. The experience of 1950 tells us that: first, at present, our agriculture is a decentralized small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, only by mobilizing and organizing the strength of the broad masses of farmers can we realize the improvement and development of agricultural and forestry undertakings. The state's disaster prevention facilities, technological improvements, and the use of investment and loans must meet the requirements of the broad masses and be conducive to promoting mass production, so as not to become a waste. In the past, some agricultural and forestry workers had a wrong understanding, that is, they often measured the scope of agricultural and forestry work from the size of the undertakings they controlled. They separated the undertakings they controlled from the production of the masses of farmers. They did not understand that the agricultural and forestry undertakings directly run by the government at present are only for demonstrating to farmers; these works have their importance in helping agricultural and forestry production specifically, but more important is the leadership and organizational role for the broad masses of farmers in terms of policies and methods. Therefore, it is certainly good to have more such demonstrative undertakings. If it is limited by funding or manpower, then having fewer does not mean that we do not pay attention to agricultural and forestry production. Although the investment and loans for agricultural and forestry undertakings in 1951 have been slightly reduced compared with 1950, the amount is still huge, and it should be used well and with emphasis, so that it can play a huge role in driving mass production. The experience of 1950 also proves that technological improvement must be based on the experience and conditions of the masses. Today, the production enthusiasm of the masses of farmers is amazing, and the work of technological improvement has gained an unprecedentedly favorable foundation. However, agricultural and forestry production is affected by various natural and social conditions, and farmers have their own production experience. Only by understanding the production conditions of the masses and summarizing the production experience of the masses can new technologies be promoted smoothly and effectively. Without this foundation, it will be impossible to make technology a weapon that the masses are willing to use. Our agricultural and forestry workers must conscientiously understand and master new production technologies, combine technology with the experience of the masses, so as to promote the production of the masses. In 1951, nearly 300 million people in the country will complete land reform. If local cadres only pay attention to general political leadership and do not learn production, they will not be able to meet the demands of the masses, and even will not be able to lead the masses well, which we must pay serious attention to.
    Fourth, agricultural and forestry production is a huge undertaking that plays a decisive role in the entire national economy, and it is also a very arduous and complex task. This cannot be completed solely by individual business departments. We must make good use of the power of all relevant departments and organize the power of all relevant departments to work together to complete this huge task. For example, the huge task of mobilizing and organizing farmers must be carried out jointly by various departments of the Party and government and people's organizations; for example, loan work must be done well by combining agricultural and forestry, banking, cooperative and other departments. For example, to ensure the rational transportation and sales of agricultural and forestry products and to ensure the price ratio of industrial raw material products, it is necessary to combine trade, cooperation, transportation, agricultural and forestry and other departments to achieve results. People's governments at all levels should regard combining the power of all relevant departments as an important key to leading agricultural and forestry production increase. All relevant business departments must also take the initiative to organically combine their work with the overall task, so as to "coordinate from the contact in work to the coordination in organization and system," overcome the phenomenon of mutual irrelevance and doing their own way, so as to victoriously complete the arduous agricultural and forestry production tasks.
    The task of agricultural and forestry production in 1951 is huge, but we have favorable conditions to successfully complete this task. Now that the spring plowing season is approaching, it is hoped that governments at all levels will quickly follow the instructions of the State Council, make specific arrangements, vigorously carry out mass production movements, and strive to completely complete this year's production tasks.

### 为完成今年农林生产任务而奋斗

　　为完成今年农林生产任务而奋斗
    中央人民政府政务院已发布了一九五一年农林生产的指示，规定了农林增产的目标，指出了为完成这些目标所应贯彻的各项政策。这在目前国家经济建设中，是有重要意义的。
    一九五○年农业和林业生产都有显著的成绩，粮食、棉花的生产超过了原定计划，植树造林也有相当成绩。这些成就，保证了全国人民衣食的需要，供应了工业原料，基本上扭转了几十年来粮食、棉花依赖入口的形势，提高了农民的购买力，扩大了农业再生产的能力，活跃了城市经济，使全国工商业得到了有利的恢复的条件。这些成就，是全国财政经济状况初步好转的重要基础。
    去年农业生产所以能有这样的成就，其主要关键是什么呢？除了一亿六千万人口的老解放区，已经实行了土地改革，新解放区贯彻了减租政策，因而普遍地提高了农民的生产热忱，新区剿匪反霸工作的展开，安定了农村的社会秩序，以及全国一半以上的地区风调雨顺等原因而外，人民政府在经济财政方面的措施，也有很大的作用。这些措施是：第一，大力帮助农民兴修水利，防治病虫害，防治牲畜疫病等，以克服自然灾害；第二，组织并指导农民改良耕作技术，提高农业生产力；第三，发展和提高了劳动互助组织；第四，颁布并实行了一系列的保护和奖励农业生产的政策。如在负担政策方面，规定由于勤劳耕作改良技术因而生产量超过应产时量，不增加其负担；如奖励劳动模范，鼓励生产；在新区实行谁种谁收，保护劳动成果。又如在农业金融政策方面，发放大量农贷，有重点地帮助贫苦农民进行生产，并扶助特产的发展。在这一系列的保护和奖励生产的政策中，对于农业生产最有重大效果的，莫过于对于工业原料作物规定合理的实物比价，以及政府对于农产品的收购的政策。政务院财政经济委员会于去年春间发布的棉粮与麻粮的比价，因为保证了农民的利润，大大地鼓舞了农民生产情绪。人民政府的贸易部门，在合理的价格政策下，广泛地展开了收购工作，尽可能地缩小农产品与工业品的剪刀差，基本上改变了多少年来秋收后农产品暴跌的现象，同时各地合作社不但配合这种收购工作，而且事先推行对农民的合同制，解除了农民生产上的顾虑。这一切，应当看作对于增加农业生产的最重要的鼓励。如去年棉花的生产，无论就播种的面积和实际的产量而言，都超过原定计划百分之十以上，就是最有力的证明。政府的护林指示，也收到了明显的效果。
    一九五一年的农林生产，有一九五○年全国农业丰收的基础，抗美援朝运动的高潮和一亿三千万人口的新区完成土地改革等有利的条件。因此，政务院指示中所规定的增产粮食，增产工业原料，植树造林，特别是增产棉、麻、烟的任务，是完全可以完成的。为了贯彻指示的精神，保证任务的完成，各级人民政府应当注意下述四项要求。
    第一、中国目前农业生产，包括手工业在内，约占整个国民经济百分之九十，对全国国民经济起着决定性的作用。因此，各级地方政府必须把领导农业生产作为贯串全年的中心任务，通过这一中心环节去推动其他工作。如指示中所指出的，在土地改革已经完成的老解放区，要求县、区、村三级人民政府集中全力面向农业生产；正在进行土地改革的地区，应尽可能争取在春耕前结束土地改革，以便不误农时地转入全力领导农业生产；其不能在春耕以前结束土地改革的地区，亦应力求告一段落，以便集中力量，领导春耕生产，完成播种任务，决不能因土地改革而贻误或影响春耕生产。待春耕紧张工作完成后，可在农忙间隙时间继续进行土改工作。过去经验证明，不仅已经实行土地改革的老区，农业生产是广大群众的迫切要求，必须通过这一中心环节才好推动其他工作；而且广大新区的农民，也因生活困难迫切要求搞好生产，因而其他工作只有结合生产，才能推行，才能事半功倍。任何忽视农业生产的观念，认为领导农业生产只是少数业务部门的事，或认为“农民会生产，用不着领导”的观点，都是错误的，必须坚决地予以纠正。
    第二、政务院指示中所规定的各项生产政策，是发动和巩固农民生产积极性的重要保证，各级人民政府，必须认真研究，并通过各种组织（如群众团体等），各种会议（如各界代表会、干部会、群众大会等），各种方式（如布告、讲演、图画、标语、游艺等），向群众三番五次地进行详尽的宣传与解释，做到家喻户晓，把政策变成群众的意见和群众的行动。对于这些政策的执行，应当不断地进行检查，表扬模范，纠正偏差，并以此来教育群众。宣传工作是保证生产的重要武器，必须善于运用这个武器，扫除群众各种思想顾虑，使之能安心生产。
    第三、在政务院的指示中已经指明，农业增产的重要环节在于组织起来，克服自然灾害，提高生产技术，兴修水利，以及对于棉、烟、麻的增产。对于这些，必须不仅作一般性的号召，还要作具体的布置。一九五○年的工作经验告诉我们：首先，在目前，我们的农业是分散的小农经济，因此，只有发动和组织了广大农民的力量，才能实现农林事业的改进与发展。国家的防灾设施，技术改进，以及投资和贷款的使用，必须适合广大群众的要求，有利于促进群众的生产，才不致成为浪费。过去有些农林工作者有一种错误的认识，就是对于农林工作的范围，每每从自己所掌握的事业的大小去衡量。他们把自己所掌握的事业与农民群众的生产分割开了。他们没有了解目前政府所直接举办的农林事业，只是为了对农民进行示范工作；这些工作对农林生产的具体帮助固然有它的重要性，但更重要的是对广大农民在政策上方法上的领导和组织作用。因此，这类示范性的事业多一点固然很好，假若由于经费或人力的限制，那末少一点也不等于不重视农林生产的工作。一九五一年农林事业的投资和贷款，虽较一九五○年略有紧缩，但数目还是巨大的，应当很好地有重点地使用，使能发挥带动群众生产的巨大作用。一九五○年的经验又证明：改进技术必须根据群众的经验和条件。今天，农民群众的生产热忱是惊人的，技术改进工作已得到了空前的有利的基础。但是农林生产要受各种自然和社会条件的影响，农民又各有自己的生产经验。只有了解群众的生产条件，总结群众的生产经验，才能使新技术顺利而有效地推广。离开了这个基础，便无法把技术成为群众乐于使用的武器。我们农林工作者必须认真地了解和掌握新的生产技术，把技术与群众经验结合起来，以推动群众的生产。一九五一年全国将有近三万万人口的地区完成土地改革，如果地方干部仅仅注意一般的政治领导，而不学会生产，就不能满足群众要求，甚至就不能很好地领导群众，这是我们必须严重注意的。
    第四、农林生产是对整个国民经济起决定作用的巨大事业，同时也是一个非常艰巨而复杂的任务，这不是个别的业务部门所能单独完成的，必须很好地运用一切有关部门的力量，把一切有关部门的力量组织起来共同为完成这一巨大任务而努力。如发动和组织农民这一巨大工作，就必须由党、政各部门以及人民团体配合起来共同努力；又如贷款工作，必须由农林、银行、合作等部门结合起来，才能做好。又如保证农林产品合理的运销，保证工业原料产品的比价，更要把贸易、合作、交通、农林等部门结合起来才能收到效果。各级人民政府，应该把结合各有关部门的力量，作为领导农林增产的重要关键，各有关的业务部门，也必须主动地把自己的工作和总的任务有机的结合起来，做到“从工作上的联系到组织上和制度上的配合”，克服互不关联各行其是的现象，以胜利地完成艰巨的农林生产任务。
    一九五一年的农林生产任务是巨大的，但我们有胜利完成这一任务的有利条件。现在春耕季节，即将到来，希望各级政府很快地遵照政务院指示，进行具体布置，大力开展群众生产运动，为彻底完成今年的生产任务而奋斗。
