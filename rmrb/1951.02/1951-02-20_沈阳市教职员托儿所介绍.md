　　Introduction to the Shenyang Municipal Staff and Workers Nursery
　　Chinese Education Union, Shenyang Municipal Committee
    There are currently eight staff and worker nurseries in Shenyang, accommodating 34 children from newborns to six years old. This not only solves the problem of childcare for female teachers but also improves their work efficiency.

    Before the establishment of the nurseries, mothers faced many difficulties in their work, study, and life, resulting in low work efficiency and frequent absences. Consequently, having children was a source of worry.

    How were the nurseries established? There were many difficulties, such as a lack of housing, funding, and equipment. However, after discussing with the administration, we obtained everyone's help, overcame the difficulties, and finally established the nurseries.

    How were the difficulties overcome?

    Firstly, regarding the housing problem. The housing in the primary schools was already insufficient, but in order to solve the nursery problem, we had to find every possible way to adjust. Nanchang Primary School mobilized the comrades living in the dormitories to move to the basement to free up the dormitories for use as a nursery. Chen Shulin, the principal of Kaiming Primary School, vacated his own house to serve as a nursery.

    Secondly, regarding the equipment problem. The equipment was very simple, with only a few small wooden beds made. The school subsidized some of the wood, and everyone donated a portion. The manual labor was generally done by the male comrades themselves, and some were hired to do it. The nannies' wages were subsidized by the administration or donated by everyone. Nanchang Primary School spent only 700,000 Northeast currency (approximately 70,000 RMB) to open a nursery that could accommodate six children.

    Thirdly, regarding the funding problem. The main expense was the salaries of the caregivers (the highest was ninety points, and the lowest was seventy points). After discussing with the administration, the school agreed to subsidize seventy points (paid from the school cooperative's profits), and the rest was borne by the children's mothers (the highest paying ten points). The administration subsidized the coal for heating. The school clinic was responsible for the children's medical care and the nursery's hygiene work.

    As for other technical issues, the Municipal Women's Federation helped to solve them.

    In order to gain more experience and promote it to other regions, we are now focusing our efforts on running the Nanchang Primary School nursery well. We plan to expand to twenty to thirty nurseries this year.

　　沈阳市教职员托儿所介绍
　　中国教育工会沈阳市委员会
    沈阳市现有教职员托儿所八处收容初生至六岁的儿童三十四名。这不但为女教师们解决了带孩子的问题，而且也提高了她们的工作效率。
    在托儿所成立以前，母亲们在工作、学习、生活上都感到很多的困难，工作效率不高，经常有缺勤的现象；因此，有了孩子就发愁。
    托儿所怎样办起来的呢？困难是很多的，例如没有房子，缺乏经费，设备不足等等。但是经过和行政上商量以后，取得了大家的帮助，克服了困难，终于把托儿所办起来了。
    困难是怎样克服的呢？
    首先说房子问题。各小学的房子都是不够用的，但为了解决托儿所的问题，又不能不想尽一切办法来调剂。南昌完小动员住宿同志搬到地下室去住，把宿舍空出来作了托儿所。开明完小陈书麟校长则把自己家住的房子腾出来作了托儿所。
    其次说设备问题。设备都很简单，只作了几张小木床。木料除由校方补助一部分外，并发动大家捐助了一部分。手工一般是男同志自己动手，有的是雇人作的。褓姆的工资由行政补助，或由大家捐赠。南昌完小开办了可容六个孩子的托儿所，只化了东北币七十万元（约合人民币七万余元）。
    再说经费问题。主要开支是保育员的工薪（最高的是九十分，最低的为七十分）。经过和行政商量以后，校方同意补助七十分（由学校合作社盈利中支付），其余则由孩子的母亲负担（最高的出十分）。烧煤则由行政上补助。幼儿的医疗及托儿的所卫生工作，由学校卫生室负责。
    至于其他一些技术上的问题，由市妇联帮助解决。
    为了取得更多的经验，以便推广到其他地区，现正集中力量办好南昌完小托儿所。并准备在今年发展到二十至三十个托儿所。
