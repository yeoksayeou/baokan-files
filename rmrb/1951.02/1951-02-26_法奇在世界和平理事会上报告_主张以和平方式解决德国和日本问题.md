Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd:

　　Yves Fauché delivered a report on the peaceful resolution of the German and Japanese issues at the morning session of the World Peace Council on the 22nd. Fauché stated: "As we embark on discussing this issue today, we can say that we must consider all the activities included in the 'Letter to the United Nations' from the Second World Peace Congress, and we can say: recalling all our activities, recalling the activities of the peoples of all countries united by the Pleyel Congress (Note: The First World Congress for the Defense of Peace was held in the Pleyel Hall in Paris) at all stages and in all aspects of these activities, we should note the following facts: the first explosion of an atomic projector occurred on July 16, 1945, the day before the opening of the Potsdam Conference, in the Alamo area (New Mexico); the first atomic bomb in wartime was dropped by American pilots on the undefended cities of Japan on August 6, 1945, two days before the Soviet army launched an offensive against Japan in accordance with the military agreement concluded with the Allied countries.

　　Messrs. Cousins and Finletter asserted to the readers of the American magazine (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Volume II, Page 7): the manufacture of the first atomic bomb gave the United States a decisive force in its relations with Russia after the end of World War II (I am quoting these two American scientists here).

　　Possessing atomic weapons is a temptation for American rulers, tempting them to abandon the hopes that President Roosevelt expressed on behalf of the American people in his last speech, when he loudly declared that he was convinced that peace was possible on the basis of concerted efforts worldwide.

　　World War II had just ended, and we were forced to notice a second fact: when it was necessary to peacefully resolve post-war problems, the agreements established between the Allied countries during the war were immediately broken. The peoples of all countries began to feel doubtful, because one of the Allied countries actually criticized the conclusive evidence of the agreements it had signed itself."

　　Fauché then reminded the attendees how the agreements were planned, and in these agreements, the Allied countries had stipulated all the prerequisites for achieving lasting peace. In this regard, he quoted the second article of the United Nations Declaration signed by 26 countries on January 1, 1942, the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the Yalta Agreement signed in February 1945, the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender of July 26, 1945, the sixth article of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender of August 14, 1945, the Far Eastern Commission's decision on the basic policies for Japan after surrender on June 19, 1947, and the Potsdam Agreement of July 17 – August 2, 1945.

　　Fauché also recounted the contents of the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty signed on May 26, 1942, the Quebec Declaration of September 1944, the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance of December 10, 1944, and the Yalta Agreement signed by the three major powers in February 1945.

　　Fauché continued: "What are the characteristics of these agreements? They determined the responsibility of Germany and Japan for the war; they laid the foundation for unity in peacetime, and for the sake of the safety of the peoples of all countries, wartime unity should be continued; they clearly declared that Germany and Japan must be disarmed both militarily and industrially. Intertwined with these solemn obligations are others: some obligations stipulated in the form of treaties, which charged those countries that had been ravaged by Nazism and Fascism to unite for the same vigilance.

　　The treaties, agreements and obligations we have pointed out could have become a starting point for cooperation between the peoples of all countries, and cooperation between the Allied countries. These Allied countries, having adopted the decision to disarm Germany and Japan, could have resolutely embarked on the path of universal disarmament, or established a state that could guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the political systems and peoples of all countries under any circumstances.

　　After reading the full text of those treaties and agreements signed by the Allied countries, one cannot help but notice that, in practice, the application of these provisions runs counter to the instructions and definitions they contain.

　　Because of this, two serious consequences of failing to fulfill the undertaken obligations have created the danger of war. These two consequences are: the Washington government's restoration of Japan and Germany as industrial and military strongholds, and thus the restoration of two regions conducive to war provocation; the Washington government's abandonment of the obligations it signed to guarantee, treating the signed treaties as waste paper, and therefore it is responsible for the formation of a situation that hinders the restoration of peace due to suspicion, jealousy, fear, and distrust.

　　How and why did this fundamental change in American policy manifest itself in fact in less than five years, frightening the peoples of all countries who understood its great danger? With the extensive participation of American businessmen and capitalists, alliances of banking and industry have been established in West Germany and Japan. McCloy's appointment as the American High Commissioner to Germany was preceded by the appointment of Mr. McCloy, nominated by Chase Bank, as the Chairman of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Whoever obtained the position of High Commissioner could manipulate the new policy of international investment that had to be disguised in the past with arguments such as "free enterprise." Therefore, when Mr. McCloy took this position, he replaced Morgenthau's colleague, Mena. Morgenthau advocated dissolving Germany's industrial cartels.

　　We also found the same industrialists in an American organization called the Holding Company Reorganization Committee. They restored the zaibatsu in Japan (those companies that enjoyed particularly extensive privileges in imperialist Japan due to the implementation of the plan planned by Tanaka Giichi to implement conquest) in order to ensure financial and political control over industry, production, and transportation not only in Japan, but also in China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam, with the assistance of large company systems.

　　Once this American-Japanese company was established, MacArthur canceled the right to strike, a right he called a fatal weapon that could not be tolerated in the current unfortunate situation.

　　In the same year, after canceling the policy of dissolving German cartels, the Humphrey Committee decided to restore the operation of 167 factories that should have been dismantled, including the Thyssen factory, which exclusively produced two million tons of steel.

　　In the Far East and Europe, every event representing a new stage on the road to war is related to activities of financial conquest.

　　When Adenauer demanded a revision of the Oder-Neisse border, we should recall that Harriman, the European implementer of the Marshall Plan, and his financial group had invested $200 million in the mines of Silesia before 1939. At the same time, he was a partner of the now-released war criminal Flick in this industry. When Krupp was released and regained ownership of his factories, we should recall that his cousin is an American citizen named Charles Krupp von Bohlen, who served as a special envoy under the American ambassador to Paris for three years, and has just been appointed as a White House advisor as an expert on Russian issues.

　　At a time when Nazis—the past executioners who slaughtered the peoples of various European countries—were being released one after another and employed according to their respective specialties, in Japan, the cases of 21,000 people who had been purged for serving as the criminal accomplices of Tojo were also being re-examined. The decision to restore political power to those forces in Japan and Germany that had been war forces has a completely dangerous similarity. The arming of the police in Germany by the Bonn government echoes the arming of the police in Japan. Schumacher's appeal for the United States to send American divisions to Germany echoes Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida's statement requesting additional U.S. troops stationed in Japan. There are 1,507 factories in the Ruhr and Rhine engaged in military production. Correspondingly, there are 320 aircraft manufacturing plants and 178 munitions factories in Japan. The ports of Bordeaux and Hamburg have become bases for unloading war materials shipped to Germany, while the anchorages of the naval ports of Kobe and Yokosuka have become American naval bases.

　　It can be seen that, contrary to the treaties, the facts that have occurred in Germany and Japan are re-cartelization, re-Nazification, and re-militarization.

　　The truth, like lightning, exposes the road to war preparations by piercing through the dense clouds of deceitful lies from time to time.

　　On June 25, 1947, Mr. Acheson stated in the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives that the U.S. government believes that restoring Germany's production is the basis for a plan that Europe can formulate in accordance with Marshall's recommendations. This forecast was later supplemented by the explanation contained in the speech by Canadian Minister Pearson, who added that the Atlantic Pact is not an ordinary Maginot Line, but a starting point from which to attack evil forces.

　　General Clay took even more decisive steps, after explaining in advance that the Atlantic Pact would ensure peace, even if it had to use force.

　　Finally, Mr. Truman went a step further in elaborating on the use of force to establish peace. He said: If it is necessary to use the atomic bomb to maintain world peace, he would use it without hesitation."

　　Fauché continued, "It should be noted that the plans of the American industrialists who aim to dominate need Nazism in order to oppress the peoples of various countries, force them to remain silent, and turn them into the deaf and blind when the exposure of the truth is most frightening.

　　We understand that Nazism knows how to conspire to create the Reichstag fire, that is, how to fabricate "covert aggression."

　　Now, in February 1951, we know that the various political forces that are still scattered can quickly restore the unity of Nazism in West Germany when the Anglo-Saxon occupiers are determined to do so.

　　Indeed, can't all those parties representing the German right-wing factions find someone to unite them when the Anglo-Saxon occupiers are determined to do so? Former Nazi SS head Westarp and Otto Abetz's advisor Krüger are both in the Socialist Reich Party. The initiator of the Homeland League, Vittinghoffen, believes that a new war is inevitable, and he asked the American High Commissioner to disband various democratic organizations in West Germany. The "German Group" already has its Reich leader. His name is Messner. He demanded the arming of Germany in Koburg with the following words: "The Americans would be very happy to have SS divisions."

　　Germans are attending this session of the World Peace Council with us here! As a Frenchman who has not recovered from being invaded, as a resistance movement fighter who once fought against the German Nazi army and aroused the people to resist Nazi oppression, I greatly admire the task that has fallen on your shoulders. I know everything you have to bear—as for us, we cannot erase the memories in our hearts (it is impossible to erase them, and we still need these memories)—in order to break the organizations that Nazism is using to revive and gradually gain power.

　　We can no longer say that there are two Germanies. We, together with all the forces for peace in the West and the East, must believe that a drama of decisive importance to mankind is being staged in your territory. No matter where we come from, we bear the same responsibility in this drama as you do. Your history proves that the struggle for unity is justified, and the characteristic of Germany in 1951 is the struggle for unity.

　　Will this unity be achieved in an atmosphere of disarmament and freedom, or in an atmosphere of rearmament and Nazism? This requires us, all those attending this session of the World Peace Council, to provide a satisfactory answer to the world.

　　What is the situation at the beginning of this year? The "Richmond Times-Dispatch" (published in Richmond, USA) on January 2, 1951, neither harboring any illusions nor misusing the word "defense," clearly pointed out the characteristics of this situation, saying: It is truly a mockery of fate that we fought Germany and Japan on the side of Soviet Russia, and now we are preparing to arm Germany and Japan to fight Russia."

　　Fauché pointed out that this preparation is being intensified. We all know this. Although they cannot hide the serious difficulties they have encountered in trying to find people in Europe, they admit that they intend to move quickly.

　　Why has the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a four-power conference to discuss the issue of eradicating militarism in Germany since November 3, 1950, not received a satisfactory response until now? They dare not say "disagree" because the peoples of all countries are acting, because peace fighters are arousing more and more people to participate in activities every day; because everyone knows that the reason why people are carrying out these activities is because people are indignantly aware that someone is shamelessly trying to plunge the world into war and trying to refuse any negotiations. They are delaying. For this purpose, the Atlantic governments proposed convening a preparatory meeting of foreign ministers' assistants. Once this request was made, Moscow immediately agreed within the same week. Later, they began to look for other excuses. Paris, London, and Washington replied: "We don't want to use Prague's proposal as the basis for negotiations." Moscow replied: "We can each put forward our own proposals."

　　So what other excuses will they fabricate to put the negotiations on hold?

　　Fauché went on to declare: We have never experienced so clearly at every moment as we do now that the peoples of all countries who have taken the fate of peace into their own hands have launched a great struggle. The struggle is going on everywhere. People are very uneasy, and we often do not know that the struggle is also going on in those groups that are quite distant from us, and it is as open and unwavering as our struggle. Therefore, the American expansion policy has encountered increasingly resolute opposition in Asia and Europe.

　　The Pacific Pact is a pact intended to play a similar role in the Far East to the Atlantic Pact. The plan for this pact has indeed encountered a crisis. The conference of representatives of the "British Commonwealth" has revealed the anxiety caused by arming Japan in Asia. Neither India nor Indonesia wants this pact. New Zealand Prime Minister Holland ran to Washington to express his anxiety. Australian newspapers pointed out that the Pacific Pact is not necessary to ensure Australia's security. MacArthur's defeat in Korea has discredited the Pentagon.

　　In this situation, due to the expression of annoyance and evasion from all sides, the United States wants to accelerate the decision in order to subdue the so-called Pacific Alliance, or rather, to pre-emptively use the fortress of rearmed Japan, that is, to "override" the weaker partners.

　　Washington is preparing to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan.

　　How will the "British Commonwealth" react? Will they succumb to the will of those Americans who disregard the treaties and are unwilling to invite the Soviet Union and People's China to participate in the Asian peace conference? At the "Commonwealth" Prime Ministers' Conference held on January 4, 1951, was it not decided that all countries that participated in the last war must participate in the discussion of the peace treaty with Japan, including People's China and the Soviet Union? Isn't the stubborn attitude shown by the Washington government in its efforts to make unjust accusations against People's China another manifestation of wanting to prevent China, and thus the Soviet Union, from participating in this discussion in Asia? Because the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on February 14, 1950, stipulates that the two contracting parties guarantee, with each other's consent, to jointly obtain the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan with the other Allied countries during the Second World War in the shortest possible time.

　　The purpose of raising these questions is to clearly show how events are developing. The defenses made by Washington for itself have failed one after another. In the United Nations, the false majority that seemed to support Austin disappeared cautiously once the national leaders of various countries understood the true political situation and made contact with their people.

　　Despite the noise at Lake Success, America's isolation in the world is deepening day by day. ... At this stage, the Washington government no longer uses tricks. It is opening up colonies. It is turning Japan into a colony in the same way that it wants to turn Germany into a colony, for the sake of the strong war economies of these two countries, for the sake of their geographical and strategic positions, and for the sake of the manpower reserves of Japan and Germany, believing that this manpower reserve can provide excellent soldiers.

　　Yesterday it was still possible to rely on the myth of "union." Today they are still talking about the myth of "unity." Finally, they have reached the idea of mobilizing mercenaries. …

　　… How can the governments of Belgium, Britain, and France fail to see that Bonn Germany has not been interested in agreeing to incorporate German troops into the European army since the Brussels Conference, because Washington only requires one thing: to regard the German army as an elite military formation and serve as the vanguard of the Atlantic army?

　　If it is assigned to undertake this mission, then why should Adenauer's Germany agree to supply coal and coking coal to France? Why did Federal Council Speaker Ellers not say to Altenburg that, in order to win this deal, the same measures taken to recover Heligoland Island must be taken on the largest scale? If the Allied High Commissioners have actually refused to allow the international regulatory agency to start operating, then why should the industrialists in the Ruhr hesitate to adopt a dumping policy when selling steel?

　　In Brussels, the constables of the alliance have been appointed and given the right to implement armaments, and this is being done secretly through those affiliated committees that are under American supervision.

　　While psychological and political preparations are being made for arming West Germany, deliberate attacks are also being launched against Czechoslovakia and Poland at the same time, and these attacks are carried out according to a plan that is completely the same as the plan implemented in the years before Hitler's aggression. This is of great significance.

　　The note that Czechoslovakia sent to the governments of Western countries on February 7 revealed the existing similarities between the current policy and the policy pursued in 1938 and 1939."

　　Fauché said, "Now is the perfect time to convene an international conference to oppose the arming of West Germany. This conference will enable those people to express their common will, who were very distant from each other yesterday, but who have united today, in order to condemn the arming of West Germany and solemnly urge the major powers to hold a four-country conference as soon as possible with a definite purpose that no one should evade again, which is: to eradicate German militarism.

　　This is the specific proposal that I am ordered to make to the first session of the World Peace Council on behalf of your executive bureau, on behalf of the Belgian-French Alliance, and on behalf of the French Peace Movement, and in accordance with the agreement we signed in Prague with our Polish friends. Countries that share common borders with Germany are preparing referendums, and these countries must call their governments' attention to the need to respect the agreements signed on behalf of the people. Belgium is holding a referendum, and France is also holding a national vote, which has enabled us to collect 3.5 million signatures since the beginning of this year from our compatriots who oppose the arming of Germany.

　　In Germany, the constitutions of many states give citizens the right to refuse military service, and it requires a two-thirds majority vote of the electorate to abolish this provision. Essen has just held an important meeting. The attendees of this meeting included lawyers, professors, pastors of the Reformed Church and the Evangelical Church, Catholic priests, social democrats holding positions in the party, chairmen of union factory committees, farmers, and youth. This meeting issued a declaration, which is a clear proof of the keen insight and courage of the publishers, which all of us here should praise. The will of the meeting was unanimously expressed. The declaration is as follows: "We are extremely concerned about the future of our people, and therefore urge all political parties, trade unions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church, individuals, groups, and committees to support these demands submitted to the federal government. Each of us vows to work hard for the holding of a referendum. We want to establish referendum preparation committees in the cities and villages of our state, composed of male and female citizens who share our ideas. In order to guide the people's movement against military preparations, we have elected a preparation committee against remilitarization composed of representatives of peace-loving people from all walks of life.

　　If the Germans exercise their democratic rights to decide their own destiny, to decide whether it is war or peace, and to express their opposition to remilitarization through a referendum, then a barrier can be built on the road to the Third World War, and peace will be preserved. Only in this way can the peaceful and happy future of our people be guaranteed."

　　If we promote the expression of this will, if we support this call, and strengthen the peace forces rising in Germany with our own efforts, then we can say that in 1951, in Essen, in the heart of the industrial Rhineland, the weapons of peace finally began to be forged.

　　Just three months ago, at the Warsaw Conference, we jointly came up with these words as the second recommendation of our letter to the United Nations: "We resolutely condemn all acts and measures that violate the international agreements prohibiting the remilitarization of Germany and Japan. These attempts and measures constitute a serious threat to the cause of peace. We firmly demand the conclusion of peace treaties with a unified, demilitarized Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from the two countries."

　　This letter to the United Nations is the new key to achieving peace."

　　法奇在世界和平理事会上报告
  　主张以和平方式解决德国和日本问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十三日电：依维斯·法奇在世界和平理事会二十二日上午会议上发表了关于以和平方式解决德国与日本问题的报告。法奇称：“当我们今天着手来讨论这个问题的时候，我们可以说，我们必须考虑在第二届世界和平大会‘致联合国书’中所包括的一切活动，并且我们可以说：回想起我们的一切活动，回想起由普列叶尔大会（按第一届世界保卫和平大会举行于巴黎普列叶尔大厅）所团结的各国人民在这些活动的各阶段和各方面的活动时，我们应该注意下列的事实：原子投射器的第一次爆炸是在一九四五年七月十六日，即波茨坦会议开会的前一日，在阿拉摩地方（新墨西哥州）发生的；战时的第一颗原子弹是在一九四五年八月六日，即在苏军依照和盟国缔结的军事协定对日本发动进攻的前两日，美国飞机驾驶员丢在日本的不设防城市上的。
    克森斯和芬莱特两位先生向美国杂志（原子弹科学家公报第二卷第七页）的读者们断言：制造第一颗原子弹使得美国在打完第二次世界大战之后，（我在这里是引用这两位美国科学家的话）对俄国的关系上有了决定性的力量。
    拥有原子武器，对于美国统治者们是一种诱惑，引诱他们抛弃罗斯福总统在他最后一次演说中代表美国人民所陈述的希望，当时他曾大声宣布：他深信：在全世界一致努力的基础上，和平是有可能的。
    第二次世界大战刚刚结束，我们就被迫注意到第二件事实：在需要和平解决战后问题的时候，盟国间战时成立的协定就马上被破坏了。各国人民开始感到疑虑，因为盟国之一对于他自己曾经签过字的证据确凿的协定竟加以非议了。”
    法奇继而提醒与会者，协定是怎样规划的，在这些协定里面，同盟国家曾经规定了达到持久和平的一切先决条件。在这一方面，他摘引了一九四二年一月一日二十六个国家签署的联合国宣言第二款，一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言，一九四五年二月签订的雅尔塔协定，一九四五年七月二十六日的告日本人民书，一九四五年八月十四日日本投降书第六款，一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会对于投降后之日本的基本政策的决议，一九四五年七月十七日——八月二日的波茨坦协定。
    法奇并追述一九四二年五月二十六日签订的英苏互助条约，一九四四年九月的魁北克宣言，一九四四年十二月十日的法苏同盟互助条约，一九四五年二月三大国签订的雅尔塔协定等的内容。
    法奇继称：“这些协定的特色是什么呢？它们确定了德国和日本对战争应负的责任；它们奠定了和平时期团结的基础，为了各国人民的安全，应该把战时的团结继续下去；它们明白的宣布：德国和日本在军事和工业两方面都必需解除武装。和这些庄严的义务交织在一起的，还有其它：一些以条约的形式规定了的义务，这些条约责成那些曾经受纳粹主义和法西斯主义蹂躏的国家为了同样的警惕而团结起来。
    我们所指出的那些条约，协定和义务，本可以成为有利于各国人民的合作，同盟国间的合作的一个出发点，这些盟国既已采取了解除德日两国的武装的决定，本可以坚决地走上普遍裁军的途径，或者建立在任何情况下可以保证各国政制和各国人民能够和平共存的状态。
    人们在读过盟国签订的那些条约和协定的全文以后，不禁注意到：在实际上，这些条文的运用，却与它们所包含的指示和界说背道而驰。
    因为这个缘故，没有履行所承担的义务的两个严重后果造成了战争的危险，这两个后果就是：华盛顿政府恢复日本和德国这两个工业和军事的据点，因而也就恢复了两个有利于战争挑衅的地区；华盛顿政府背弃它所签字保证的义务，把签订的条约当成废纸，因此它也就对怀疑、猜忌、恐惧与不信任的心理妨碍恢复和平的那种局势的形成负有责任。
    美国政策的这种基本的改变，怎么样而且为什么在不到五年的时期内就在事实上表现出来，使了解其重大危险的各国人民感到惊恐呢？在美国商人和资本家广泛参加之下，西德和日本都已成立了银行界和工业界的联盟。麦克洛埃之被委任为美国驻德高级专员，事前的准备工作就是任命大通银行所提名的这个麦克洛埃先生担任国际复兴与开发银行的董事长。高级专员这个位置是谁取得了它可以操纵过去必须用“自由企业”之类的论据作为伪装的国际投资的新政策的。因此，麦克洛埃先生在担任这一个位置时，是把摩根索的同僚梅那驱逐出去之后取而代之。摩根索是主张解散德国工业的卡特尔的。
    我们在叫做持股公司整理委员会的一个美国组织中也发现相同的那些实业家，他们恢复日本的财阀（由于田中义一的计划中所规划的实行征服的主张而在帝国主义日本享有特别广泛的特权的那些公司），以便借大公司系统的协助，不但在日本，而且在中国，在菲律宾，在印度尼西亚和越南，确保对工业，对生产和运输在财政和政治两方面的控制。
    一当这一个美日公司成立以后，麦克阿瑟就取消了罢工的权利，这种权利被他称为在目前不幸的局面下不能容许的一种致命的武器。
    同一年，亨弗莱委员会在取消了解散德国卡特尔的政策以后，又决定将应该拆除的一百六十七所工厂恢复开工，其中包括独家生产二百万吨钢的蒂森工厂。
    在远东和欧洲，代表走上战争道路的新阶段的每一事件，都和财政征服的活动有关系。
    当阿登纳要求修改奥得——尼斯河疆界的时候，我们应该回想到马歇尔计划欧洲执行人哈里曼和他的金融集团在一九三九年以前曾经在西里西亚的矿场投资两亿美元，同时在这一个实业中他是现已开释的战犯佛利克的伙东。当克虏伯被释而又恢复了他的工厂的所有权时，我们应该回想到他的表兄弟是美国的公民，名字叫做查尔士·克虏伯·冯·波伦，在美国驻巴黎大使下面作过三年的特派公使，刚刚以俄国问题专家的资格被任命为白宫的顾问。
    在纳粹分子——过去屠杀欧洲各国人民的刽子手们被纷纷开释并各按照其特长而被任用的时候，在日本，因为曾经充当东条的犯罪作恶的走狗而被整肃的二万一千人的案子也重新审查了。使日本和德国国内曾是战争势力的那些势力重握政权的决定，有着十足的、非常危险的类似之处。在波恩政府的德国给警察以武装跟在日本给警察以武装互相呼应。舒马赫要求美国派美国师团到德国而发出的呼吁，跟日本首相吉田要求增派驻日美军的声明互相呼应。在鲁尔和莱因有一千五百零七个工厂从事军事生产，和这相当，在日本也有三百二十家飞机制造厂和一百七十八家军火工厂。波尔多港和汉堡港，变成了起卸运往德国去的作战物资的根据地，而神户和横须贺军港碇泊所也变成了美国海军基地。
    由此可见，和条约恰好相反，在德日两国发生的事实却是，重新卡特尔化、重新纳粹化、重新军国主义化。
    真情实况象闪电一样，时时穿过诳语谎言的密云而曝露出战争准备的道路。
    一九四七年六月二十五日，艾奇逊先生在美国众议院拨款委员会中声明说：美国政府认为恢复德国的生产是欧洲可以依照马歇尔的建议而拟订的一种计划的基础。这种预告后来更由加拿大阁员皮尔逊的演说中所包含的解释加以补充，皮尔逊补充说：大西洋公约并不是寻常的马奇诺防线，而是一个出发点，可以从那儿进攻恶势力。
    克莱将军则采取了更有决定性的步骤，事先他曾作如下的解释说：大西洋公约将确保和平，即使不得不使用武力也在所不顾。
    最后，杜鲁门先生在阐述凭借武力以奠定和平方面又更进了一步。他说：倘若为了维持世界和平而必须使用原子弹的话，他会毫不迟疑地使用它。”
    法奇继续说：“应该注意到，志在称霸的美国工业家们的计划，需要纳粹主义，以便压迫各国人民，迫使他们缄默，当真相的暴露最可害怕的时候就使他们变成聋子和瞎子。
    我们明白，纳粹主义知道怎么样阴谋制造国会纵火案，就是说，怎么样捏造“隐蔽的侵略”。
    现在，一九五一年二月，我们知道，依然分散的各种政治势力，联合起来就可以很迅速地在西德恢复纳粹主义的统一。
    实在的，所有那些代表德国右翼派别的政党，当盎格鲁撒克逊占领者决意那么干的时候，难道找不出一个人来把他们联合起来吗？前纳粹党卫军头子威斯达普，跟奥托·阿贝兹的顾问克鲁格尔都在社会帝国党中。祖国联盟党发起人费腾汉塞尔认为新战争必不可免，他要求美国高级专员解散西德的各种民主组织。“日耳曼集团”已有它的帝国元首。他的名字叫做美斯纳。他曾在科堡地方用下面的话来要求把德国武装起来，他说：“美国人会很高兴有纳粹党卫军师团。”
    德国人在这儿跟我们一起出席世界和平理事会的这一届会议！作为一个被侵略之后还不曾恢复元气的法国人，作为一个曾经对德国纳粹军队作战，并且唤起人民反对纳粹压迫的抵抗运动战士，我非常感佩已经落在你们身上的任务。我深知你们不得不承担的一切——至于我们，也不能磨灭我们心中的记忆（这是不可能磨灭的，何况我们还需要这些记忆）——以便打破纳粹主义正在借以复活并逐渐得势的那些组织。
    我们不能够再说什么两个德国了。我们跟西方和东方的一切和平力量在一起，必须认为：在你们的领土上正在演出对人类具有决定性的戏剧，不管我们是从什么地方来的，我们在这个戏剧中都负着和你们同样大的责任。你们的历史证明了为统一而奋斗是正当的，一九五一年德国的特点便是为统一而奋斗。
    这种统一将是在解除军备和自由的空气中达成呢，还是在重整军备和纳粹主义的空气中达成呢？这就要我们，要所有出席世界和平理事会本届会议的人大家来提出可以使全世界满意的解答。
    今年年初的形势怎样呢？一九五一年一月二日“时代快邮报”（在美国里士满城发行）既不抱什么幻想，也不滥用“防卫”这个字眼，清清楚楚地指出这种形势的特点说：那真是命运的嘲弄，我们站在苏俄一边对德国及日本打过仗之后，现在却准备把德国和日本武装起来去打俄国了。”
    法奇指出：这种准备正在加紧进行。这一点我们大家都知道。虽然他们隐瞒不了他们在欧洲设法找人的时候，遭到了严重困难，他们自承打算赶快动作起来。
    为什么自从一九五○年十一月三日以来，直到现在苏联提议召开四强会议讨论为德国肃清军国主义问题的建议始终没有得到满意的答复呢？他们不敢说一声“不同意”，因为各国人民在行动着，因为和平斗士们天天唤起越来越多的人民参加活动；因为大家知道，人民之所以进行这种活动是因为人民愤慨地知道有人厚颜无耻地力图把世界投入战争之中，并且力图拒绝任何谈判。他们是在拖延时间。为了这个目的，大西洋各国政府就提议召开外长助理的预备会议。这种要求一经提出，莫斯科立即在同一个星期内就表示同意。后来，他们又开始寻找一些别的借口。巴黎、伦敦和华盛顿回答说：“我们不想采用布拉格的建议作为谈判的基础。”莫斯科答复说：“我们每一个人都可提出自己的建议。”
    那么他们再捏造出别的什么借口来把谈判搁置起来呢？
    法奇进而宣称：我们从来不曾像现在这么清楚地时时刻刻体验到已将和平的命运掌握在自己手中的各国人民已经发动了伟大的斗争。到处都在进行斗争。人民非常不安，而我们常常不知道，在跟我们颇为疏远的那些集团中，也在进行着斗争，而且与我们的斗争同样的光明磊落而坚忍不拔，所以美国的扩张政策在亚洲和欧洲都遭遇到日益增长的断然的反对。
    太平洋公约是要在远东发挥与大西洋公约类似的作用的一个公约，关于这个公约的计划的确是遇到了危机。“大英联邦”各国代表会议已透露出由于武装日本而在亚洲引起的焦虑。无论印度或印尼都不要这个公约。新西兰总理赫兰跑到华盛顿去申诉他的焦虑。澳大利亚报纸指出：太平洋公约并不是确保澳大利亚的安全所必需的。麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的挫败已使五角大楼的威信扫地。
    在这种情况下，由于各方面表示烦恼与推诿，美国想要加速决定，以便制服所谓太平洋联盟，或者说，用重新武装日本这个要塞来先发制人，也就是要“凌驾”弱小的伙计。
    华盛顿正在进行准备签订单独的对日和约。
    “大英联邦”各国将如何反应呢？它们将屈从那些无视条约而不愿邀请苏联和人民中国参加亚洲和平会议的美国人的意志吗？在一九五一年一月四日举行的“联邦”总理会议上，难道不曾决定，凡是参加上一次大战的一切国家必须参加讨论对日和约，人民中国和苏联也包括在内吗？华盛顿政府竭力要提出对人民中国不公正的谴责，它所表现的顽固不化的态度难道不是想阻止中国、从而阻止苏联参加亚洲的这个讨论的另一表现吗？因为苏联与中华人民共和国在一九五○年二月十四日签订的友好同盟互助条约中规定，缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能最短期间共同取得对日和约的缔结。
    提出这些问题的意思就是要清楚地表明事件是在怎样发展的。华盛顿为自己所作的强辩一个接一个地失败了。在联合国中似乎支持奥斯汀的虚伪的多数，一当各个国家的国家领袖明白了真实的政治情势并且与他们的人民有了接触的时候，就小心审慎地消失了。
    尽管在成功湖喧嚣不已，美国在世界上的孤立却一天一天地加甚了。……在现阶段，华盛顿政府不再利用诡计。它在开拓殖民地。它在用它想把德国变为殖民地的那种方法来将日本变为殖民地，为的是这两个国家的强大的战争经济，为的是它们地理的与战略的地位，为的是日本和德国的人力后备，以为这种人力后备能够提供出色的兵士。
    昨天还可能依仗关于“联合”的神话。今天依然在谈论着关于“团结”的神话。最后，他们达到了关于动员雇佣兵的主张。……
    ……比利时、英国和法国的政府怎么会看不到，波恩德国自从布鲁塞尔会议之后对于同意把德国军队编入欧洲军队一事不感兴趣，因为华盛顿只要求一件事：把德国军队视为精锐的军事编队而充当大西洋军队的前锋？
    如果分派它担负这一种使命，那么，阿登纳的德国为什么应该同意以煤和焦煤供给法国呢？联邦议会议长艾勒斯为什么不对奥尔顿堡说，为了赢得这场买卖，必须以最大的规模来采取为收复黑尔郭兰岛而采取的同样的措施呢？如果盟国高级专员们已经实际上拒绝了国际管制机构开始活动的话，那么，鲁尔的工业家们为什么还要迟疑不在售钢的时候采取倾销政策呢？
    在布鲁塞尔，联盟的宪兵已被任命并且被赋予了实行武装起来的权利，而且是秘密地经由那些已在美国人监督之下的附属委员会来进行的。
    为了武装西德而在心理上与政治上进行准备的时候同时故意对捷克斯洛伐克和波兰加以攻击，而这种攻击又是按照一项与希特勒侵略以前几年所实行的计划完全相同的计划进行的，这一点，意味很是深长。
    捷克斯洛伐克二月七日向西方国家政府提出的照会中揭露了目前的政策与一九三八年和一九三九年奉行的政策之间现有的相似之处。”
    法奇说：“现在正是召开国际会议来反对武装西德的大好时机，这个会议将使那些人士可以表示共同的意志，他们之间昨天还有很大的距离，而今天已经团结起来，为了谴责武装西德并且郑重地敦促各大国怀着一个谁也不应再事规避的确定的目的而早日举行四国会议，这个目的就是：肃清德国军国主义。
    这就是我奉命代表你们的执行局、代表法比联盟、而且代表法国和平运动、同时根据我们在布拉格与我们的波兰朋友签订的协定而向世界和平理事会第一届会议提出的具体建议。与德国有着共同疆界的各国正在筹备公民投票，这些国家不得不唤起它们的政府注意必须尊重代表人民所签订的协定。比利时正在举行公民投票，法国也在举行全国投票，这次投票使我们自本年年初以来就征集了三百五十万份由我国反对武装德国的同胞们签名的票。
    在德国，许多州的宪法使公民有权拒绝服军役，而要取消这一条又需要选民三分之二的多数票。埃森刚刚举行了一次重要的会议。出席这次会议的有律师、教授、改革派教会和福音教会的牧师、天主教神父、在党内担任职务的社会党员、工会工厂委员会的主席、农民和青年。这个会议发表了一项宣言，这宣言乃是发表人的眼光敏锐与勇敢的明证，我们这儿所有的人都应该加以赞扬。会议的意志被一致表示出来。这个宣言如下：“我们极为关心我国人民的未来，因此敦促所有的政党、工会、天主教会和福音教会、个人、各团体与各委员会支持这些向联邦政府提出的要求。我们每一个人都发誓尽力为举行公民投票而工作。我们要在我们这一州的各城市与乡村建立公民投票筹备委员会，由那些跟我们有同样想法的男女公民组成。为了指导反对军事准备的人民运动，我们已经选出了一个由各阶层爱好和平人民的代表组成的反对重新军国主义化筹备委员会。
    如果德国人履行他们的民主权利来自己决定自己的命运、来决定是战争还是和平、并通过公民投票来表示他们反对重新军国主义化，那么，就可以在走向第三次世界大战的道路上筑起一道障壁，和平将得以保全。只有这样，我国人民的和平与幸福的未来才能得到保证。”
    倘使我们促成表示这种意志，倘使我们支持这个号召，用我们自己的努力来加强在德国兴起的和平力量，那么我们就可以说，一九五一年在工业的莱因州的心脏埃森，终于开始铸造和平的武器了。
    恰恰在三个月以前，在华沙大会上，我们曾共同想出了这几句话作为我们致联合国书的第二项建议：“我们坚决斥责一切违反禁止德国和日本重新军事化的国际协定的举动与措施。这些企图与措施构成对和平事业的严重威胁。我们坚决要求与统一的、非军事化的德国和日本缔结和约，并从该两国撤退占领军。”
    这个致联合国书是获致和平的新锁钥。”
