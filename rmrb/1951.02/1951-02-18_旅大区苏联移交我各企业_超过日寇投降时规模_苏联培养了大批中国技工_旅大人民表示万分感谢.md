Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 15th: The factories and enterprises in the Lüda area, formerly under Soviet temporary administration or leased by the Soviet side, which were unconditionally transferred to our country by the Soviet government, greatly exceeded the scale at the time of the Japanese surrender. Before the transfer, not only were the equipment of the factories and enterprises expanded, but the Soviet side also cultivated a large number of Chinese technical personnel, making important preparations for normal production after the transfer.

Due to the Soviet Union's efforts in management during the period of trusteeship and lease, the equipment of various enterprises was expanded, and the industrial production of the Lüda area developed rapidly. The former Sino-Soviet joint venture, the Far East Electric Power Company, expanded from the twelve factories it had at the beginning of liberation to twenty-one, the number of workers increased four and a half times, and the types of products increased from the original dozen or so to more than a hundred. In addition to the installation of most of the new-style machines in a newly built mechanical factory, the scale of other equipment increased by 200% compared with the initial stage of the factory's construction, the number of workers also increased by 463%, and the total output value increased by 439%. The production efficiency of the Dalian Shipbuilding and Repair Yard also increased 36 times compared with the initial stage of production recovery after the Japanese surrender.

The Soviet Union's achievement in cultivating a large number of Chinese technical personnel is of particular significance to our country's economic construction. According to the statistics of only three production units, more than 4,650 technical personnel were trained. Before liberation, the Dalian Locomotive Depot did not have a single Chinese train driver. Within a year or two after liberation, all driver jobs were replaced by newly trained Chinese drivers. The Soviet section chief of the locomotive depot, Lisov, personally trained six female train drivers and three female stokers. During the Japanese rule, Chinese workers at Dalian Port were completely coolies. After liberation, with the help and training of the Soviet Union, this group of workers has become skilled managers and technicians. Zhu Wanjun, a worker at the shipyard, has been trained and promoted to the director of technicians.

The people of the Lüda area expressed their utmost gratitude for this great friendly assistance from the Soviet Union. Wang Leshan, a worker at the Dalian Shipbuilding and Repair Yard, said on the eve of the anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "At the beginning of liberation, the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang blockaded Lüda. The Soviet Union transported materials and food from home to help us overcome the blockade and restore production. Now that the factory has expanded, production has developed, and the Soviet Union has transferred the factory to us. We should not only be deeply grateful to them, but more importantly, manage the factory better, so that we can live up to the Soviet people." The Dalian Petroleum Company was in the process of transfer during the New Year. The Soviet comrades worked as usual during the three-day holiday. Many workers were greatly moved. They said: People are so responsible when they hand over the factory to us. We should really learn from them.

　　旅大区苏联移交我各企业
　  超过日寇投降时规模        
    苏联培养了大批中国技工
　  旅大人民表示万分感谢
    【新华社大连十五日电】由苏联政府无偿地移交我国的旅大地区的原由苏方临时代管或租用的工厂企业，大大超过了日寇投降时的规模。在移交以前，不但工厂企业的设备扩大了，而且苏联方面大量地培养了中国技术人员，为移交后的照常生产作了重要准备。
    由于苏联在代管和租用期间的努力经营，扩大了各种企业设备，旅大地区的工业生产迅速地发展了。原中苏合营的远东电业公司，由解放初所属的十二个工厂扩大到二十一个，工人增加了四倍半，产品种类亦由原来的十几种增加到百余种。新建的某机械厂除装设了大部新式机器外，其他设备的规模较建厂初期增加了百分之二百，工人亦增加了百分之四百六十三，生产总值提高了百分之四百三十九。大连造船修船厂的生产效率也比日寇投降后恢复生产初期提高了三十六倍。
    苏联大批培养中国技术人员的成就，对于我国的经济建设价值尤其重大。仅以三个生产单位统计，培养出的技术人员即有四千六百五十余名。大连机务段解放前没有一名中国火车司机，解放后一两年内，所有司机工作均由新培养出的中国司机代替。该机务段苏联段长李索夫并亲手培养出六名女火车司机和三名女司炉。在日寇统治时代，大连海港中国工人完全是杂工。解放后这批工人在苏联的帮助和培养下，已成为熟练的管理人员、技术人员。修船厂的工人朱万俊已被培养和提拔为技师主任。
    旅大地区人民对苏联这种伟大友谊援助，表示万分感谢。大连修船造船厂工人王乐山在庆祝中苏友好同盟条约一周年的前夕说：“在刚解放的时候，美蒋匪帮对旅大进行封锁，苏联从国内运来材料、粮食，帮助我们战胜封锁，恢复生产。现在工厂扩大了，生产发展了，苏联便把工厂移交给我们。我们不但应深深地感激他们，而且更重要的是把工厂管理得更好，这才能对得起苏联人民。”大连石油公司在移交中正逢新年，苏联同志在三天假期中照常上班。许多工人大为感动。他们说：人家把工厂交给我们时都这样负责。我们真应当好好学习。
