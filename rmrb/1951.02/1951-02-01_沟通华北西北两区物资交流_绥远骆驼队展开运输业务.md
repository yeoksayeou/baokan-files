　　Connecting Material Exchange Between North and Northwest China
    Suiyuan Camel Teams Launch Transportation Business
    [Our Newspaper] The Suiyuan Camel Team of the Gui Sui Hui People's Production and Supply Cooperative in Suiyuan Province, a means of transportation for promoting material exchange in the Northwest region, now has more than two thousand camels and a Suiyuan Camel Transport Liaison Group. It undertakes various consignment sales and purchases, carrying industrial products to rural areas and various parts of the Northwest, and transporting pastoral products from the Northwest to Gui Sui and Tianjin, assisting in the development of trade between North and Northwest China.
    This organized camel team was divided into three parts, active in the grasslands of North China and the deserts of the Northwest. In May of last year, 517 camels in 13 groups went to Wuchuan, Wulanhua, Dalate, Taolin and other places to purchase wheat on consignment, carrying 326 bolts of homespun cloth, bricks of tea, matches, towels, sneakers, etc. When this task was completed, they loaded a large number of daily necessities and went to Yulin to purchase fur. A batch going to Inner Mongolia carried silk belts, Mongolian boots, duffel bags, brick tea, homespun cloth, city cloth, etc., to Bailingdi and Siziwang Banner to exchange for Mongolians’ old felt, livestock, fur, etc. In February of last year, the Hui People's Production and Supply Cooperative also organized more than 120 camels to Liangzhou and Dihua, Hami, returning to Suiyuan at the end of June. It is said that they carried 160 boxes of about 3,800 bricks of tea (one-third sold in Jiuquan, Gansu, and the rest sold in Hami, Xinjiang). After being stationed in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces for three months, they exchanged for 20,000 jin of wool, 7,000 jin of camel hair, and more than 5,000 old sheepskins and returned. Brick tea and daily necessities were in short supply in Gansu and Xinjiang, and large quantities of fur and medicinal materials could not be sold. This trip by the camel team not only made a lot of profit in trade, but also played a connecting role in the material exchange in the Northwest. The second batch of camel teams of the cooperative departed in mid-November last year, carrying a large number of goods to Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Qinghai and other places for trade.
    The Suiyuan Camel Team was the main force of transportation in the area twenty years ago, with a considerable scale of 200,000 camels. Later, it was destroyed by the Xinjiang warlord Ma Zhongying and declined. After liberation, thanks to the support of the people's government through loans and other methods, it gradually recovered. Two-thirds of the more than 3,000 camels in Gui Sui City have been organized. If the public security along the way can be consolidated, the role of the camel team will be further brought into play.        (Feng Ren)

　　沟通华北西北两区物资交流
    绥远骆驼队展开运输业务
    【本报讯】开展西北区物资交流的运输工具——绥远省归绥回民生产供应社的绥远骆驼队，现拥有二千多头骆驼和一个绥远驼运联络组。承办各种代销代购和载负工业品分赴农村和西北各地，运输西北的牧产品到归绥和天津，协助开展华北与西北的贸易。
    这支有组织的骆驼队曾分成三部分，活跃在华北的草原地带和西北的沙漠上。去年五月份，曾有五百一十七头骆驼分十三个组至武川、乌兰花、达拉特、陶林等地代为收购小麦，去时运出土布三百二十六匹，和砖茶、火柴、毛巾、球鞋等。在这项任务完成后，又驮上大量日用品，往榆林收购皮毛。去内蒙的一批载有绸腰带、蒙古靴子、褡裢、砖茶、土布、市布，赴百灵地和四子王旗一带准备换取蒙民的乱毡子、牲畜、皮毛等。去年二月，回民生产供应社还曾组织了一百二十多骆驼去凉州和迪化、哈密，至六月底返绥。据称：载去一百六十箱约三千八百余块砖茶（三分之一销于甘肃酒泉，其余销于新疆的哈密）。在甘、新二省放场三月后，换取羊毛二万斤，驼毛七千斤，老羊皮五千多张返回。甘、新等地砖茶及日用百货供不应求，而大宗皮毛、药材出产亦无法推销，该驼队此行不但在交易上获利很多，而且对西北物资交流起了沟通作用。该社第二批驼队已于去年十一月中旬出发，运了大批货物，分赴甘、新、宁、青各地进行贸易。
    绥远骆驼队二十年以前，曾为该地运输的主力，阵容相当浩大，共有二十万头。后为新疆军阀马仲英摧残因而衰落。解放后，由于人民政府用贷款等方法的扶植，渐行恢复，归绥市三千多头骆驼已经组织起来了三分之二。沿途治安如能巩固，则骆驼队的作用，将会更大地得到发挥。        （逢人）
