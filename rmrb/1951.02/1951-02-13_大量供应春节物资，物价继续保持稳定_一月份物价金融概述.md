　　Large Supply of Spring Festival Goods, Prices Continue to Remain Stable
    ——Overview of Prices and Finance in January
　　Yang Fangxun
    January was just before the Spring Festival in 1951. Under the Central People's Government's policy of consolidating financial stability and stabilizing prices, and with the large supply of materials by state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants in various regions, prices continued to remain stable. According to the price index of six major cities compiled by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the end of January 1951 increased by 3.3 percent compared to the end of December 1950. The slight increase in prices was mainly the result of state-owned trading companies proactively adjusting the listed prices of certain commodities in order to maintain the rationality of price policies. For example, the listed prices of cotton cloth and cotton were slightly increased.
    The main characteristic of prices before the Spring Festival was the general increase in the volume of transactions for various New Year goods. This is a reflection of last year's bumper harvest and the increased purchasing power of farmers. For example, in Shijiazhuang, the transaction volume of colored cloth was 458 bolts on January 9th, and 1,301 bolts on January 16th, an increase of more than two times. The Dongxiaoshi branch of the Beijing Department Store was crowded with customers every day. The sales amount in mid-January increased three times compared to early January. The department store sold sugar, socks, towels, sneakers, paints, etc.
    The stability of prices in January was achieved through the following efforts:
    First, state-owned trading companies prepared a large amount of materials to supply the market. On January 12th, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government issued an instruction to vigorously stabilize Spring Festival prices. It stipulated: "The policy for stabilizing prices during the Spring Festival is to resolutely stabilize market wholesale prices at the current listed price level, and to stabilize retail prices as much as possible, in order to lay the foundation for stabilizing prices when the market opens after the Spring Festival." "Major cities should immediately check the reserves and deployment of major materials to ensure a large supply to the market." Trade companies in various regions have made great efforts to implement the instructions for stabilizing Spring Festival prices. For example, the price of sugar in Xi'an once soared due to the shortage of goods from the trade company. On January 26th, the listed price of white sugar was 5,600 yuan per catty, and the market price rose to 8,300 yuan, 48 percent higher than the listed price. On the 27th, a large batch of spot goods from state-owned companies arrived, and were supplied without restriction at the listed price of 5,600 yuan. The market price immediately fell to 6,000 yuan on the same day. Another example is the price of yarn in Shenyang in late January, which rose due to merchants from other places grabbing goods off the market. On January 25th, the market price was 2.5 million Northeast currency per bundle. When the market opened on the 26th, private merchants shouted for 2.66 million. After the trust company supplied a large amount of goods without restriction at 2.38 million yuan to all parties, the market price fell back to 2.45 million yuan. In short, the state-owned trading companies prepared sufficient materials and supplied them in large quantities, which is the basic factor for price stability.
    Second, various regions organized the exchange of local products, which increased the quantity of New Year goods on the market. For example, although the demand for Chinese cabbage in Beijing increased during the Spring Festival, a large amount of Chinese cabbage was transported to Beijing from Yutian County, keeping the price of field-grown cabbage stable at between 350 yuan and 400 yuan.
    Third, local governments organized private merchants to jointly stabilize Spring Festival prices. In Hankou, private merchants were organized through the Federation of Industry and Commerce to formulate a convention to not raise prices. Industries such as grain, vegetables, and meat held meetings to stipulate that all goods should be sold at marked prices. The prices on the day of the meeting were taken as the standard, allowing for decreases but not increases. In the paper industry in Chongqing, some merchants attempted to raise prices in the market on January 23rd. After the industry's guild discovered this, it immediately reported it to the relevant government departments, and jointly dumped a large amount of paper on the market, keeping paper prices stable.
    Due to stable prices, the financial market also showed a stable state. Deposits and loans from both state-owned banks and private banks increased. Loans increased because of the active exchange of goods and merchants needed more funds. Therefore, the loan balance of private banks in seven major cities on January 20th increased by 31 percent compared to the end of last December. In addition, the price of securities rose and the price of gold and silver fell, indicating that floating capital was invested in beneficial production undertakings, reducing speculation and profiteering.

　　大量供应春节物资，物价继续保持稳定      
    ——一月份物价金融概述
　　杨方勋
    一月份是处在一九五一年春节前夕，在中央人民政府巩固金融稳定物价的方针下，经各地国营贸易公司、合作社和私商的大量供应物资，物价继续保持稳定状态。据中央人民政府贸易部所编六大城市物价指数来看，一九五一年一月底与一九五○年十二月底比较上升百分之三点三。物价微升的原因，主要是国营贸易公司为了保持价格政策的合理，将某些商品牌价主动调整的结果。如纱布与棉花牌价，均略加提高。
    春节前物价的主要特点是，各种年货的成交量普遍增加。这是去年丰收、农民购买力提高的表现。如石家庄色布的成交量，一月九日是四百五十八匹，十六日是一千三百零一匹，增加二倍多。北京市百货公司东晓市门市部每日顾客络绎不绝，一月中旬的售货额较一月上旬增加三倍，出售的百货有食糖、袜子、毛巾、球鞋、颜料等。
    一月份物价的稳定，是由下列几方面努力获得的：
    第一、国营贸易公司准备大量物资，供应市场。一月十二日，中央人民政府贸易部发出了大力稳定春节物价的指示。其中规定：“稳定春节期间物价的方针为：在目前牌价水平上，坚决稳定市场批发价格，并尽量稳定零售价格，为春节以后开市时稳定物价打下基础。”“各大中城市应即检查主要物资储备及调运、部署情况，保证大量供应市场”。各地贸易公司均为实现稳定春节物价的指示作了很大努力。如西安食糖曾一度因贸易公司货缺而暴涨，一月二十六日白糖每斤牌价五千六百元，市价即涨至八千三百元，高出牌价百分之四十八，二十七日国营公司大批现货运到，按五千六百元牌价无限制供应，当日市价即落至六千元。又如沈阳纱价在一月下旬曾因外地客商在场外抓货，影响市价上升，一月二十五日每捆市价东北币二百五十万元，二十六日开盘时私商曾高喊为二百六十六万，经信托公司不分对象按二百三十八万元不限数量大量供应，使市价回落至二百四十五万元。总之，国营贸易公司准备了充分的物资大量供应，是物价稳定的基本因素。
    第二、各地组织土产交流，使市场年货数量增多。如北京市的白菜，虽然春节需要增多，但由玉田县组织大量白菜运京，使伏地白菜价格，始终平稳在三百五十元至四百元之间。
    第三、各地政府组织私商，共同稳定春节物价。汉口市通过工商联合会，组织私商制定公约，互不涨价。粮食、蔬菜、肉类等行业均开会规定，一律明码售货。并以开会日的价格为标准，许落不许涨。重庆市纸张业中，有部分行商曾于一月二十三日企图在市场抬价，该业同业公会发觉后，马上报告政府有关部门，并联合同业各户，在市场大量抛售，使纸价始终保持平稳。
    由于物价平稳，金融市场也呈现了稳定状态。国家银行与私营行庄的存放款均有增加。放款因物资交流活跃，商人用款较多，所以七大城市的私营行庄，一月二十日的放款余额，较去年十二月底即增加百分之三十一。此外，证券价格上升，金银价格下落，表现了游资投向有利的生产事业，而减少了投机倒把。
