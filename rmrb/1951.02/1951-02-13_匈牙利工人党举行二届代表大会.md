    [Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 11th] According to TASS, the Hungarian Workers' Party is scheduled to convene its Second National Congress on the 24th. Party organizations in various provinces and cities have successively held representative conferences to elect delegates to attend the congress and review their work. In their speeches at the representative conferences, the secretaries of local party committees all pointed out the great significance of holding the Second Party Congress in the current international situation. The issues discussed at the representative conferences included: the consolidation of the Party, Party building, cadre work, and propaganda and mobilization work. Attendees pointed out that the work of recruiting party members has greatly improved recently.
    The conferences also paid attention to the labor emulation drive, which has become widespread across the country and has achieved great results. They also reviewed the advantages and disadvantages in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the work of local People's Representative Conferences (referring to local organs of power). At the Party Representative Conference held in Szolnok, Deputy General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party, Gerő, emphasized that the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of the agricultural cooperative movement are the Party's central tasks in the near future. At the same time, local party organizations should pay more attention to the work of the People's Representative Conferences and provide them with multifaceted assistance.
