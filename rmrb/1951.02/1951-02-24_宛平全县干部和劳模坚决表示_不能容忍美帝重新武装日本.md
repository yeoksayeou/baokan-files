　　Wanping County Cadres and Model Workers Firmly Declare
    Cannot Tolerate US Imperialism's Re-arming of Japan
    [Report from this newspaper] The news of the US imperialist plot to re-arm Japan has reached the mountainous areas of Wanping County, arousing great indignation among the people of all walks of life there. On February 18, county, district, and village cadres and labor models who attended the enlarged meeting of cadres of Wanping County discussed the US imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan and passed a letter of accusation to the people of the world, accusing the Japanese寇 of their atrocities in Wanping. The letter of accusation states:
    On July 7, 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression against China at the Lugou Bridge in Wanping County, and immediately occupied the entire Wanping County, establishing a stronghold every fifteen Chinese miles within the territory. The people of all villages were forced to repair roads and build bunkers for the Japanese寇 every day, or do other hard labor. The people were unable to carry out production, most of the land was abandoned, and they had no food or clothing. During the eight years, the Japanese寇 killed more than 1,000 peaceful residents in Wanping County. Forty-two farmers in Wangjiashan Village were locked in a room by the Japanese寇 and burned alive. Tan De of Dongzhaizhai Village was strangled with iron wire. Li Yongzhen, Zhang Dama, and other six people in Chiyan Village were cut into eight pieces by the Japanese寇 with knives. Many women—from fourteen-year-old girls to old ladies in their sixties—were raped by the Japanese寇. Of the 185 villages in the county, 142 were burned down, some villages as many as seven times. Over the past eight years, a large number of livestock have been robbed and killed by the Japanese寇. According to incomplete statistics, there were 3,568 cattle, 2,134 donkeys, 2,305 mules and horses, 52,000 sheep, 12,500 pigs, 36,100 chickens, and 850 swarms of bees. Jinjitai Village originally had 70 mules, more than 110 donkeys, 70 cattle, and more than 1,800 sheep. After being looted by the Japanese寇, only one mule, eight donkeys, fifteen cattle, and two hundred sheep remained. The grain, clothing, and furniture burned and looted in the county totaled 68.9 million catties of millet. The Japanese寇 pushed the people of Wanping into extreme poverty. Every village in Wanping County still bears the scars of being ravaged.
    However, the people of Wanping did not yield. In 1938, the Chinese people's savior—the Eighth Route Army led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao—arrived here and, after uniting with the Communists who had been fighting there, led the people of Wanping in an indomitable and heroic struggle against Japanese imperialism. The people of Wanping provided public grain and war service, and vigorously supported the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the eight years, 2,426 people in the county joined the People's Liberation Army, and 1,476 people participated in local work: 670 people gloriously sacrificed their last drop of blood in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and 850 honorary soldiers with glorious scars are now participating in production at home. Finally, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, with the concerted efforts of the people across the country, and with the help of our great ally, the Soviet Union, we defeated Japanese imperialism!
    Now, after suffering a shameful defeat in the war of aggression against 朝鲜, US imperialism has stepped up its conspiracy to arm Japan. The purpose of US imperialism in arming Japan is to use Japan as a pawn for aggression in Asia. The people of Wanping see this very clearly. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made a statement on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan as early as December 4 last year, and we express our firm support. The Chinese people, who suffered great sacrifices in the War of Resistance Against Japan, cannot tolerate the evil act of US imperialism in arming Japan!
    Like all the Chinese people, the people of Wanping love peace and justice. Fifty-three percent of the people in our county have signed the Peace Declaration. Last year, our county suffered severe floods, and the people's lives were relatively difficult. However, after US imperialism launched the war of aggression against 朝鲜, the staff and masses of our county still donated a large amount of grain and funds to aid 朝鲜 refugees. Up to now, 6,179 catties of grain and 4,846,600 yuan have been donated, and donations are continuing.
    In the future, all the people of our county will strive to improve production, do a good job in current affairs propaganda, rectify the work of tilling land on behalf of others, eliminate bandits, special agents and reactionary secret societies, and do our best to support the Chinese and 朝鲜 People's troops. We are determined to use these practical actions as a counterattack against the US imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan!

### 宛平全县干部和劳模坚决表示  不能容忍美帝重新武装日本

　　宛平全县干部和劳模坚决表示
    不能容忍美帝重新武装日本
    【本报讯】美帝国主义阴谋重新武装日本的消息传到宛平县山区，引起了当地各界人民的极大愤恨。二月十八日，参加宛平全县干部扩大会议的县、区、村干部暨劳动模范，对美帝武装日本的阴谋进行了讨论并通过向全世界人民控诉日寇在宛平的暴行的控诉书。控诉书称：
    一九三七年七月七日，日本帝国主义在宛平县境内芦沟桥畔发动了向中国全面侵略的战争，并即侵占了宛平全县，在境内每隔十五华里设一据点。各村人民终日被迫去为日寇修路，筑碉堡，或做其他苦工。人民无法进行生产，大部土地荒废，衣食无着。八年中，日寇在宛平县杀死了一千余名和平居民。王家山村的四十二名农民，被日寇锁在一间屋子里活活烧死。东斋堂村谭德被用铁丝绞死。翅雁村李永珍、张大马等六人被日寇用刀大卸八块。妇女们——由十四岁的女孩子到六十多岁的老太太，有不少人都遭受到日寇的奸淫。全县一百八十五个村庄，被烧毁一百四十二个，有的村庄被烧七次之多。八年来，被日寇抢走和杀死了大批牲畜。据不完全的统计，计有牛三千五百六十八头，驴二千一百三十四头，骡马二千三百零五匹，羊五万二千只，猪一万二千五百口，鸡三万六千一百只，蜂八百五十群。金鸡台村原有骡子七十匹，驴一百一十余头，牛七十头，羊一千八百多只，被日寇抢掠后，只剩下一匹骡子，八头毛驴，十五头牛，二百只羊。全县被烧毁及抢走的粮食、衣服、家具，共折合小米达六千八百九十万斤。日寇将宛平人民推入极端贫困的境地。宛平县境内每个村庄到现在仍然带着被蹂躏的伤痕。
    但是，宛平人民并没有屈服，一九三八年，中国人民的救星——共产党、毛主席所领导的八路军到达了这里，与坚持该地斗争的共产党员会合后，即领导宛平人民向日本帝国主义进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。宛平人民出公粮，出战勤，大力支援了抗日战争。八年中，全县有二千四百二十六人参加了子弟兵，有一千四百七十六人参加了地方工作：六百七十人在抗日战争中流尽了最后一滴血光荣牺牲了，八百五十名带着光荣伤痕的荣誉军人现在在家参加生产。终于，在毛主席的英明领导下，在全国各地人民一致努力下，在我们伟大友邦苏联的帮助下，我们战胜了日本帝国主义！
    现在，美帝国主义在侵朝战争中遭到可耻的失败之后，加紧了武装日本的阴谋活动，美帝国主义武装日本的目的是想把日本做为侵略亚洲的爪牙，这一点，我们宛平人民看得非常清楚。我国周恩来外长早在去年十二月四日就作了关于对日和约问题的声明，我们表示坚决拥护。在抗日战争中遭受重大牺牲的中国人民，是不能容忍美帝武装日本的罪恶行为的！
    宛平人民和全中国人民一样，热爱和平，热爱正义。我县百分之五十三的人民曾在和平宣言上签了名。去年，我县遭受了严重的水灾，人民生活比较困难。但在美帝发起侵朝战争之后，我县工作人员与群众仍然捐输了大批粮食、款项救济朝鲜难民。截至目前为止，已捐出粮食六千一百七十九斤，款四百八十四万六千六百元，且正继续捐献中。
    今后，我县全体人民将努力提高生产，做好时事宣传，整顿好代耕工作，肃清匪特及反动会道门，尽力支援中朝人民部队。我们决以这些实际行动，作为对美帝武装日本阴谋的回击！
