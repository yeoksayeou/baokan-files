　　The Great Construction of New China - Radically Curing the Huai River
　　By our reporter Gu Weijin

　　The Huai River flood is a historical disaster. But now that it's in the hands of the people's government, we will not only fundamentally eliminate this historical disaster, but also begin long-term beneficial projects.
　　　　Our October 15, 1950, editorial
　　　　  
　I. The Huai River Basin is a Fertile Area
　　The Huai River originates in the Tongbai Mountains of Henan Province, and now flows into the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal in eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. There are many tributaries on both sides, including the Hong River, Ying River, Fei River, Qian River, Wo River, Hui River, Tuo River, Sui River, Shi River, Pai River, and Chi River. There are also many lakes in the Huai River basin, including Hongze Lake, Gaoyou Lake, Baoying Lake, Chengdong Lake, Chengxi Lake, Tangduo Lake, Daijia Lake, Mengjia Lake, Jiaogang Lake, and Jiangjia Lake. The Huai River, together with the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, the Yi River, and the Shu River, constitutes the Huai River Basin. The entire area covers the southern parts of Shandong and Henan provinces, and the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, covering approximately 280,000 square kilometers. It has a population of 58 million and 180 million mu of cultivated land.

　　The Huai River Basin is very rich in products. It is rich in rice, wheat, beans, sorghum, corn, peanuts, sesame, cotton, medicinal materials, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. Furthermore, "Lu'an Famous Tea," "Huaiyuan Pomegranates," "Dangshan Famous Pears," "Huainan Coal Mines," and "Huai River Silver Fish" are famous throughout the country. In the summer, the North Huai Plain is a sea of green wheat. The yield of wheat is amazing. Each mu yields about 200 jin, and in the fields along the river bends (i.e., where the river turns), the yield per mu reaches 300 to 400 jin. Miscellaneous grains such as sesame and beans also yield 200 to 300 jin per mu. The common people say, "One harvest feeds us for several years." "Harvest the river bend and feed half the sky; harvest the river bend, and red-tasseled hats cover the sky (red-tasseled hats refer to the covers of open-air granaries)." The local people often praise the richness of their homeland. For example, they say, "Golden Pan Village, Silver Bo Gang (belonging to Jiashan County), Daliu Lane that will never be poor for ten thousand years (belonging to Sihong County)." - And, "Walk a thousand, walk ten thousand, nothing beats the banks of the Huai River."

　　The Huai River Basin is indeed a fertile area.

　II. The Yellow River Seizing the Huai River, the Huai Disaster Brings Tragic Encounters to the People

　　From the fifth year of Shaoxi during the reign of Emperor Guangzong of the Song Dynasty (1194 AD) to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and even during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the Yellow River breached its banks several times, invading south into the Huai River. The Huai River water system became silted up by the sediment of the Yellow River, the path to the sea was blocked, and the waterways to the Yangtze River were not smooth. Under these circumstances, the Huai River water system developed the problem of water accumulating and being difficult to discharge, resulting in major disasters in heavy rain and minor disasters in light rain. The Huai River flood became increasingly severe.

　　The local people suffered extremely tragic encounters during the years of disaster. A farmer representative from Wuhe County in northern Anhui recalled the great flood of 1931: "At that time, only the landlords in our village had boats. Three silver dollars bought a life, and those without money couldn't get on the boat." He personally witnessed Liu Qiyun from the same village, who didn't have money to board the boat, pushing his crying eight-year-old daughter into the water first, and then his whole family jumped into the water to commit suicide. Huang Dongchen, a farmer representative from Datong Township in Fuyang County, said, "That flood was truly suffering a fate that even dogs wouldn't endure. We all fled to the top of the dam, suffering from cold and hunger. I don't know how many dead people were buried on the dam. At night, bandits came by boat to rob grain, and during the day, the Kuomintang sent troops to search every household for 'public grain.' It was impossible to distinguish between officials and bandits. Our village barely survived by fishing and shrimp until the frost fell and the water receded. We wanted to wade through the mud to plant wheat, but the Kuomintang came to conscript soldiers again. The township wanted three, and the bao wanted seven. There was nowhere to hide. My younger brother was so anxious that he sprinkled lime into his eyes, blinding himself." In the Yellow River flooded area, when the flood came, people and snakes were driven to the trees together, and people and snakes engaged in a brutal struggle in the trees, resulting in people being bitten to death by snakes. After the flood, when people returned to their homes, everything was gone. But at this time, landlords and bullies exploited farmers with high-interest loans of "one to seven" (i.e., borrowing one dou of grain and repaying seven dou of grain).

　III. The Reactionary Ruling Class Uses the Pretext of Governing the Huai River to Carry Out Deception and Plunder

　　The long-term Huai River disaster brought extremely tragic encounters to the people. However, the reactionary rulers never took it as a serious matter; on the contrary, they used the pretext of governing the Huai River to carry out deception and plunder. By 1912, the warlords occupying the Huai River basin, under the guise of governing the Huai River, obtained foreign loans as capital for fighting civil wars. In 1929, the reactionary Kuomintang government established the "Huai River Guidance Committee," with Chiang Kai-shek concurrently serving as chairman, and formulated a set of engineering plans for guiding the Huai River, seemingly to truly govern the Huai River. In reality, they were plundering the people's blood and sweat. For example, in 1934, Chen Guofu (the pseudo-vice chairman of the Huai River Guidance Committee and pseudo-chairman of Jiangsu Province) issued 20 million yuan of water conservancy bonds in Jiangsu Province, using less than 10 million yuan for Huai River guidance expenses, and embezzling the rest to open a bank for himself. The Huai River Guidance Committee, under the control of the four major families, embezzled and wasted the funds for guiding the Huai River, and finally abandoned the work of guiding the Huai River.

　　In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek breached the dikes at Huayuankou and released floodwaters, submerging 17 million mu of farmland and leaving more than 6.1 million people struggling in the vast waters. Moreover, from then on, the Huai River water system was completely disrupted, suffering disasters every year, and the broad masses of people were in the depths of suffering.

　IV. The People's Government Truly Serves the People and Radically Cures the Huai River

　　After the Huai River Basin was liberated and the people seized power, the era of disregarding the Huai River disaster was ended. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, governing the Huai River was regarded as the fundamental link in eliminating the floods in the Central Plains. Therefore, the Central People's Government has formulated a wise policy and plan for radically curing the Huai River. This policy and plan are fundamentally different from the partial Huai River governance plans of the past reactionary ruling class (i.e., limited to dredging the flood in northern Jiangsu). It establishes a unified Huai River governance organization, the Huai River Governance Committee, to lead the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu to cooperate and govern the Huai River together; implement comprehensive planning for storage and discharge in the upper, middle, and lower reaches; focus on storage in the upper reaches (Henan), build reservoirs, and promote soil and water conservation. - In the middle reaches (northern Anhui), storage and discharge are equally emphasized. In the lower reaches (northern Jiangsu), the waterways to the Yangtze River are reorganized to facilitate drainage. The implementation of this policy and plan can fundamentally eliminate the Huai River flood and take care of drought prevention and water conservancy. This will open up unlimited beautiful prospects for agricultural production and shipping.

　　To implement this policy and plan, a large-scale project is needed. According to rough estimates, the earthwork alone requires more than 200 million cubic meters, and many technically demanding projects need to be carried out. The completion of the entire project will take three to five years.

　　This year - 1951 - is the first year of radically curing the Huai River. The People's Government has decided to focus on Huai River governance in the country's water conservancy work. Investing 500,000 tons of rice as funds for Huai River governance, mobilizing 3 million migrant workers to work on the dikes. Carrying out key flood storage projects in the upper reaches, as well as dredging and dike restoration projects. After completing these projects, this year can turn major disasters in heavy rain and minor disasters in light rain into minor disasters in heavy rain and no disasters in light rain. The historically disaster-stricken Huai River will gradually reduce disasters starting this year.

　V. Radically Curing the Huai River, Causing the People of the Huai River Basin to Join in a Wave of Jubilation

　　The feudal dynasties, feudal warlords, and the reactionary Kuomintang government had no way to govern the Huai River. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang relied on "Huai River governance" to plunder the people, and in 1938, they breached the dikes and released floodwaters, exacerbating the Huai River flood. Now, the Central People's Government has only been established for more than a year, and the national financial and economic situation has not yet fundamentally improved, but it has undertaken the arduous task of radically curing the Huai River, which the people have long yearned for. This is a great miracle created by the Mao Zedong era! This is the superiority of the new democratic system of the victorious New China!

　　When the news of the People's Government radically curing the Huai River - which will open up a great and happy future for the entire historical era of the people's survival in the Huai River Basin - reached the Huai River Basin, how jubilant were the tens of millions of people! Here and there, they are enthusiastically supporting Chairman Mao's instruction to radically cure the Huai River. The masses in the Yellow River flooded area said, "The Yellow River flooded us for eight or nine years, the farmland was destroyed, the houses were destroyed, and there was no way to survive. This time, Chairman Mao is determined to govern the Huai River, which is saving us from death." The masses in various parts of northern Anhui said, "In the past, there was no end to the disasters, but now Chairman Mao has come up with an idea to eliminate this great disaster (i.e., the Huai River flood), which has never happened in any dynasty. Our children and grandchildren will have good days in the future." Some people abolished the Kitchen God they had worshiped for many years and hung up Chairman Mao's portrait. They said, "We have worshiped the Kitchen God for a lifetime, but we have not spent a single good day. Chairman Mao has come, and our good days have come." People are vying to sign up to join the Huai River governance army and are actively preparing everything to go to the dikes. Some people sold local products to purchase river management tools; others who could not afford river management tools used old soil cannons, spears, and knives, and bells from temples to make river management tools.

　　Radically curing the Huai River, this news that the broad masses of people have longed for for a long time, has revitalized the people in the Huai River region, who were depressed by the heavy drought, as if they had seen the spring sun.

　VI. The 800,000-Strong Huai River Governance Army Unveils the Prelude to the Struggle Against Natural Disasters

　　November and December of last year were unforgettable days.

　　In the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River, from the Tongbai Mountains in Henan Province in the west to northern Jiangsu in the east, within this basin area of more than 200,000 square kilometers, there were 800,000 Huai River governance troops from the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, thousands of water conservancy experts and technical engineering personnel, and tens of thousands of vehicles and ships, who advanced to the Huai River area one after another, day and night. This is the winter repair project for radically curing the Huai River that people have long yearned for.

　　The cold wind howled on the river, the river was frozen with ice, and the ground was frozen. The winter repair project was arduous. However, this heroic Huai River governance army fought against difficulties with perseverance. In order to dredge, they jumped into the icy river to dig mud; in order to obtain soil to restore the dikes, they came up with a method of breaking the ice to get soil. In the area where new river channels were being opened, some sections often had a layer of sandstone conglomerate more than one meter thick (i.e., a combination of sand and stones of varying sizes), which was particularly hard in winter. Tools were damaged again and again, but the river management warriors were not discouraged. "Mountains are opened by people," they repaired their tools and continued the arduous project. In the area where new river channels were being opened, sometimes water would gush out after digging less than seven or eight inches of soil. So they ignored the biting cold wind and went into the water to dig dragon ditches (i.e., digging ditches horizontally and vertically to divert the water). At night, when they returned to their residences - the small sheds along the river - the cold wind and rain and snow often attacked the sheds. However, they gritted their teeth and endured the long, cold winter nights.

　　Why could they, this heroic Huai River governance army, fight against difficulties so tenaciously? This is because: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they had fought against the Japanese invaders under the leadership of the Communist Party and the New Fourth Army. During the Liberation War, they had fought against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army under the leadership of the People's Liberation Army. After the Huai River Basin was liberated, they had carried out struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing bullies, reducing rent, and producing to save themselves from disaster under the leadership of the People's Government. These struggles have given them great training, making them deeply realize that only by following the Communist Party and the People's Government can they have a victorious tomorrow. Now, when they are fighting again under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government to eliminate this historical natural disaster, they recall the past and yearn for a victorious tomorrow, how can they not be filled with confidence and be motivated to fight to overcome difficulties!

　　In the days of fighting against difficulties, whether it was dredging, dike restoration, or river opening, they achieved many results. The main one was creating high labor efficiency. For example, the Zhu Huaibin migrant worker class in Jingtou District, Wuhe County, northern Anhui, averaged nearly three cubic meters of earthwork per person per day (the general achievement is around two cubic meters). In Yingshang County, the highest earthwork efficiency per person per day for all migrant workers in the county reached 4.7 cubic meters, and the lowest also reached 2.1 cubic meters. The migrant workers in Yingshang County created tools for digging fine mud and slope rulers, which also improved work efficiency. The ramming workers in Wuhe County even created a method of using stone rollers for ramming, which improved the work efficiency of the ramming workers by two times compared to the original use of stone chips for ramming. The embankments compacted by the stone roller ramming are also more solid than before. In improving work efficiency, they generally can meet the standards of the project.

　　The achievements of the winter repair have made the Huai River governance project initially take shape: In the upper reaches (Henan), the flood storage projects in the two depressions of Laowangpo and Wu Songhu have been completed. The flood storage projects in the two depressions of Tonghu and Jiaotinghu have also been carried out with key construction. In addition, the dredging and dike restoration projects of the Ying River, Ru River, Bailu River, Zhu River, Guan River, and Du River in the area have also been completed according to plan. In the middle reaches (northern Anhui), according to statistics from the four special zones of Sixian, Fuyang, Lu'an, and Chuxian, and the two cities of Huainan and Bengbu, a total of 10.88 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed in dredging and dike restoration. In the lower reaches (northern Jiangsu), the Grand Canal embankment has completed 1.27 million cubic meters of embankment reinforcement and increasing the height.

　　Now, the winter repair project has come to an end. People are welcoming the large-scale spring repair project with renewed efforts.

　　新中国的伟大建设——根治淮河
    本报记者  古维进
    淮河的水灾，是一个历史性的灾害。但是到了人民政权手中，我们不但要根本消灭这个历史性的灾害，并且即将开始长期的兴利工程。
　　　  本报一九五○年十月十五日社论
　　　　  
　一、淮河流域，是一片丰饶的地区
    淮河发源于河南省桐柏山，现在，经豫东、皖北、苏北合运河流入长江。全长一千一百五十八公里。两岸的支流很多，有洪、颍、淝、芡、涡、浍、沱、濉、史、渒、池等河。淮河流域的湖泊也很多，有洪泽湖、高邮湖、宝应湖、城东湖、城西湖、唐垛湖、戴家湖、孟家湖、焦岗湖、姜家湖等。淮河合苏北段运河、沂水、沭河三水系构成淮河流域。全域面积占鲁、豫两省的南部，苏、皖两省的北部，约有二十八万平方公里。有五千八百万人口，有一亿八千万亩耕地。
    淮河流域的物产是非常丰饶的。盛产米、麦、豆、高粱、玉蜀黍、花生、芝麻、棉花、药材、烟草、果蔬等。而“六安名茶”、“怀远石榴”、“砀山名梨”、“淮南煤矿”、“淮河银鱼”更是驰名全国。在夏季，在淮北平原，是一片碧绿的麦海。小麦的产量非常惊人。每亩地约产二百斤，在河湾一带的地里（即大河转弯的地方），每亩地的产量达三、四百斤。杂粮如芝麻、豆类等，每亩地亦产二、三百斤。老百姓都说：“收一季，吃几年。”“收了大河湾，养活半个天；收了大河湾，红缨帽子遮了天（红缨帽子指露天仓廪的盖子）。”当地人民经常在赞扬自己家园的富庶。如说：“金潘村，银泊岗（属嘉山县），万年穷不了的大柳巷（属泗洪县）。”——又说：“走千走万，不如淮河两岸。”
    淮河流域，的确是一片丰饶的地区。
　二、黄河夺淮，淮患给人民带来悲惨的遭遇
    自宋光宗绍熙五年（公历一一九四年），至元、明、清以至蒋介石统治时期，黄河数度决口，南侵入淮，淮河水系便给黄水的泥沙淤塞，入海的道路不通，入江的水道不畅。在此种情况下，淮河水系已形成积水难泄，大雨大灾，小雨小灾的毛病。淮河的水灾便愈闹愈大了。
    当地人民在灾难的岁月里，受到极其悲惨的遭遇。皖北五河县农民代表回忆一九三一年的大水灾说：“那时候，俺村只有地主家有船。三块光洋买条命，没钱的就莫上船。”他亲眼看见同村的刘起云没有钱上船，就把哭喊的八岁闺女先推下水去，然后一家子跳水自杀。阜阳县大同乡农民代表黄栋臣说：“那次大水，真是狗不受的罪都受尽啦。大伙逃到坝顶上，受冻挨饿。坝上也不知埋了多少死人。夜里，土匪乘船来抢粮食，白天，国民党派兵来挨家搜缴‘公粮’。也分不出谁官谁匪。俺庄打鱼捞虾好容易熬到霜降水下去，想涉浠泥糊种麦，那知国民党又来抓丁了。乡里要三个，保里要七个。躲到那也不中。俺老弟急的就拿石灰把眼撒瞎了。”在黄泛区，当大水来时，人和蛇一齐被赶到树上，人和蛇在树上展开残酷的斗争，结果人被蛇咬死了。当水灾过后，人们回到自己的家园，什么都没有了。但是这时地主恶霸却用“一比七”的高利贷（即借一斗粮还七斗粮）剥削农民。
　三、反动统治阶级借口治淮，实行欺骗和掠夺
    长期的淮患，给人民带来极其悲惨的遭遇。但是反动统治者从来不把它当作一回事情；相反，却以治淮为名，干着欺骗、掠夺的勾当。到了一九一二年，盘踞淮河流域的军阀，则以治淮为名，取得对外借款作为打内战的资本。一九二九年，国民党反动政府成立“导淮委员会”，蒋介石兼任委员长，拟订出导淮的一套工程计划，似乎真要治理淮河。实际上则进行掠夺人民的血汗。如一九三四年，陈逆果夫（伪导淮委员会副委员长兼任伪江苏省主席）在江苏省发行水利公债二千万元，仅以不及一千万元为导淮经费，其余全部贪污，为私人开办了银行。导淮委员会就在四大家族的把持下，把导淮的经费贪污浪费干净，最后把导淮的工作丢在九霄云外。
    一九三八年，蒋介石在花园口掘堤放水，淹没了一千七百万亩田地，使六百一十余万人民挣扎在汪洋大水中。而且，从此以后，淮河水系全被打乱，年年遭灾，广大人民处在苦难的深渊里面。
　四、人民政权，真正为人民服务，根治淮河
    淮河流域解放，人民掌握政权之后，结束了过去所有一切漠视淮患的时代。在英明的毛主席领导下，把治淮当作消灭中原一带人民水灾的根本环节。因此，中央人民政府已制订出一个英明的根治淮河的方针和计划。这个方针和计划，和过去反动统治阶级局部治淮的计划（即仅限于苏北疏导洪水）有根本的区别。它建立统一的治淮组织即治淮委员会，领导豫、皖、苏三省互相配合共同治淮；实行上中下游蓄泄兼筹；在上游（河南）以蓄为主，兴建水库，推行水土保持。——在中游（皖北），蓄泄并重。在下游（苏北），则整理入江的水道，以利宣泄。这个方针和计划的实施，已能做到根本消除淮河的水患，又能做到照顾防旱与兴办水利。这对于农业生产和航运将开辟着无限美好的远景。
    为了实现这个方针和计划，需要进行一个规模巨大的工程。据粗略统计，仅土方一项即需要二亿公方以上，还要举办不少技术性较高的工程。全部工程的完成。需要三年至五年的时间。
    今年——一九五一年——是根治淮河的第一个年头。人民政府决定全国水利工作以治淮为重点。投资五十万吨大米为治淮的经费，动员三百万民工上堤。在上游进行重点蓄洪工程，及疏浚复堤等工程。完成这些工程后，今年可以做到把大雨大灾，小雨小灾，变成大雨小灾，小雨无灾。历史上多灾多难的淮河，将从今年开始逐渐减轻灾害。
　五、根治淮河，使淮河流域人民卷入欢欣鼓舞的浪潮
    封建皇朝、封建军阀和国民党反动政府，没有治淮的办法，蒋匪四大家族更依靠“治淮”搜刮人民，一九三八年且掘堤放水，加重了淮河的水灾。现在，中央人民政府仅成立一年多，国家财政经济情况尚未基本好转，就担负起人民渴望已久的根治淮河的艰巨任务。这是毛泽东时代创造的伟大的奇迹。这是胜利了的新中国的新民主主义制度的优越！
    当人民政府根治淮河的消息——这个将给淮河流域人民生存的整个历史时代，开展着伟大的幸福的前途——传到淮河流域的时候，数千万人民多么欢欣鼓舞呵！这里那里都在热烈地拥护毛主席根治淮河的指示。黄泛区的群众说：“黄水把俺们淹了八、九年，田地给冲坏了，房屋给冲毁了，眼看就没有活的路子。这回毛主席决心治淮，算把俺们从死里救出来了。”皖北各地的群众说：“从前受灾难没得个底，现在毛主席出主意消灭这个大灾难（即淮患），真是那一个朝代都没有的事情。咱们子子孙孙往后都有好日子过了。”有的人废除供奉多年的灶王，挂上了毛主席的像片。他们说：“把灶王供奉一辈子，没有度过一天好日子。毛主席来，俺们的好日子跟着来了。”人们争相报名投入治淮大军，并且积极准备上堤的一切。有的人卖掉土产购置治河工具；有的人购置不起治河工具，把旧有的土炮、矛刀及庙上的钟等制造治河工具。
    根治淮河，这个广大人民响往已久的消息，业已把被沉重的灾荒压得死气沉沉的淮域人民，如同看见春天的太阳那样，活跃起来了。
　六、八十万治淮大军，向着自然灾害展开斗争的序幕
    去年十一、十二月间，这是一个难忘的日子。
    在淮河上下，西自河南省的桐柏山区，东至苏北，在这二十余万平方公里的流域面积内，有着豫、皖、苏三省的八十万治淮大军，数以千计的水利专家和技术工程人员，以及上万的车辆和船只，先先后后、日日夜夜地向着淮河一带前进。这就是人们向往已久的根治淮河的冬修工程。
    寒风在河上怒号，河里结着冰块，地面冻起来了。冬修的工程是艰苦的。但是，这支英勇的治淮大军，以坚韧不拔的精神和困难作斗争。为了疏浚，他们跳进冰河里挖泥；为了取土复堤，他们想出破冻取土的办法。在开辟新河道的地带，有的工段，常有一公尺多厚的砂礓层（即大小不一的砂石的结合体），在冬日里特别显得坚硬。工具一次又一次地被损坏，但是治河的勇士并不灰心。“山是人开的”，他们修好工具，继续进行艰苦的工程。在开辟新河道的地带里，有时也会遇见挖土不到七、八公寸，下面冒出水来。于是他们不顾刺骨的寒风，下水挖龙沟（即横直挖沟把水引走）。晚上，当他们回到自己的住处——那河沿的矮小的工棚时，寒风和雨雪时常向工棚袭击。但是，他们咬紧牙关挨过漫长的严寒的冬夜。
    他们，这支英勇的治淮大军，所以能这样坚韧地和困难作斗争，是什么原因呢？这就是：当抗日战争期间，他们曾经在共产党和新四军领导下，和日寇作斗争。当解放战争期间，他们曾经在人民解放军领导下，和蒋匪军作过斗争。当淮河流域解放，他们曾经在人民政府领导下，进行清匪、反霸、减租、生产救灾等斗争。这些斗争，给了他们很大的锻炼，使他们深刻认识到只有跟着共产党和人民政府走，才能有胜利的明天。现在，当他们又在共产党和人民政府领导下，为消灭这个历史性的自然灾害，进行又一次斗争的时候，他们回想着过去，向往着胜利的明天，他们怎么不充满信心地振奋起来为克服困难而战斗呢！
    在和困难斗争的日子里，不管疏浚、复堤、开河，他们都获得许多成绩。其中主要的就是创造高度的劳动效率。如皖北五河县井头区朱怀斌民工班，平均每人每天挖土近三公方（一般成绩是两公方左右）。颍上县全县民工每人每天挖土效率最高的达四点七公方，最低的也达二点一公方。颍上县民工创造了挖细泥工具及坡度尺，也提高了工作效率。五河县硪工更创造了使用石磙硪的办法，使硪工工作效率较原来使用石片硪时提高了两倍。经石磙硪压实的堤防也较前巩固。他们在提高工作效率中，一般都能做到合乎工程的标准。
    冬修的成绩，使治淮工程初具规模：在上游（河南），已将老王坡及吴宋湖两处洼地的蓄洪工程全部完成。童湖、蛟停湖两处洼地的蓄洪工程，也进行了重点施工。另外，该地的颍河、汝河、白露河、竹河、灌河、杜河等的疏浚复堤工程，亦已按计划完成。在中游（皖北），据宿县、阜阳、六安、滁县四个专区及淮南、蚌埠两市统计，在疏浚和复堤当中，共完成一千零八十八万方土。在下游（苏北），运河河堤已完成一百二十七万方土的培修与加戗工程。
    现在，冬修工程已告结束。人们正以再接再励的精神，迎接规模宏大的春修工程。
