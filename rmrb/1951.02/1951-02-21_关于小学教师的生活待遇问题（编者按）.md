　　The letters from Shandong Weifang, Shanxi Jiexiu, and Hebei Sanhe published in today's newspaper regarding the living conditions of primary school teachers raise the demands of primary school teachers in various regions. According to surveys: the salary income of primary school teachers (mainly in rural areas) in areas such as Pingyuan, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong is not only less than that of all other wage earners, but the vast majority is even lower than the benefits of general public mess halls. Furthermore, the method of paying salaries in kind often involves issuing bad grain, frequent short weighting, arrears, or converting the grain into cash at the lowest grain price, making it impossible for primary school teachers to maintain a minimum standard of living and to work with peace of mind, seriously affecting the development of primary school education. To this end, we suggest that local areas consider implementing the following measures: (1) Appropriately increase the wages of rural primary school teachers whose wages are too low; the standard should generally not be lower than the full benefits of public mess hall cadres; (2) If some areas cannot reach this salary standard due to a shortage of local grain, public-private partnerships, public assistance for private schools, and rewarding private schools can be adopted to solve the funding problem; (3) In order to guarantee the actual wages of primary school teachers, local areas should convert the wage grain into currency at the local average price for public employees. The method currently implemented in Hebei Province of issuing 45 catties of grain per month and paying the remainder in cash at the market price can also be promoted.
　　
	Jiexiu Primary School Teachers Request to Convert Wage Grain Price to Currency

　　Editor:

　　After the liberation of Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, the salaries of primary school teachers were uniformly paid in grain by the government. This played a significant role in ensuring the livelihood of teachers during periods of price fluctuations. However, at present, the cumbersome procedures for receiving and distributing wage grain and losses due to weight discrepancies have increased the burden on teachers and delayed teaching work. For example, rural teachers must go to the city once a month to receive grain collectively by unit, and after each person separates it, they must transport it to the market for sale, which takes at least three days. After several turnovers, each teacher's grain, calculated at 150 catties, may lose 12 or 13 catties. In particular, the simultaneous entry of grain from teachers across the county into the market has led to a decline in grain prices. For example, ordinary rice can be sold for 750 yuan per catty, while "teacher's rice" can only be sold for 570 yuan, which invisibly reduces the treatment of teachers and increases the burden on teachers' lives and thoughts.

　　We, on behalf of all the teachers in the county, suggest to the government that it should issue cash to primary school teachers on a monthly basis according to the discount method, in the same way as departments, public industrial and mining enterprises. This will not only overcome the difficulties and losses in receiving and distributing salary grain, but also will not affect teaching work.

　　Weifang Primary School Teachers Request to Increase Wage Grain Price

　　Editor:

　　I would like to tell you about some situations regarding the lives of primary school teachers:

　　The salaries of primary school teachers in Weifang City, Shandong Province are calculated in millet, with an average monthly salary of about 200 catties of millet per person. The salary grain for January was issued at 700 yuan per catty, and the highest salary that can be issued is about 150,000 yuan. However, the families of colleagues generally have four to six members, and the most have nine members. It is quite difficult to maintain life on salary income.

　　However, all people in the city except primary school teachers are paid according to the financial grain price of 1,050 yuan. Although these situations have been repeatedly reported to the trade union, there have been no results.

　　Colleagues can appreciate the current financial difficulties of the government and do not demand improved treatment, because this will affect the country's expenditure. However, we believe that the living problems of primary school teachers should also be appropriately resolved, otherwise it will affect our teaching work. With best regards.

　　Sanhe County Uses Small Beans to Convert Grain for Salaries, Primary School Teachers Suffer Too Much

　　Editor:

　　I think teachers should be specialized, but most teachers in our county lack or do not have this kind of ideological preparation at all. After careful understanding, their low work enthusiasm is also related to the low treatment of primary school teachers. For example, the salary grain issued to teachers by the grain depot in January was issued by converting 1.2 catties of small beans into 1 catty of millet, while the market price of millet was 1,000 yuan per catty, but the price of small beans was less than 700 yuan per catty, and 1.2 catties of small beans was not worth 800 yuan. A junior primary school teacher's monthly salary grain is about 150 catties, but the small beans received are not even equivalent to 120 catties of millet. This difference cannot be considered small for primary school teachers. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the work enthusiasm of teachers.

### 关于小学教师的生活待遇问题（编者按）

　　关于小学教师的生活待遇问题（编者按）
    今天本报所发表的山东潍坊、山西介休、河北三河等地关于小学教师待遇问题的来信，提出了当前各地小学教师的要求。据调查：平原、苏北、河北、山西、山东等地小学（主要是乡村）教员的工资收入情况，不但比一切工资收入者都少，而且绝大多数比一般供给制的大灶待遇还低。在薪资米的支付办法上，又多发坏粮，经常发生短秤、拖欠或按最低粮价折款等现象，使小学教师无法维持最低生活水平，不能安心工作，严重地影响了小学教育的开展。为此，我们建议各地可以考虑执行以下的办法：（一）对于乡村小学教师的工资待遇过低者应适当提高，其标准一般不应低于大灶供给制干部的全部待遇；（二）某些地区如因地方粮少不能达到这个发薪标准时，可采用公办民助，民办公助及奖励私办学校以解决经费问题；（三）为了保证小学教师的实际工资，各地应按当地一般公教人员之工资米折价改发货币。目前河北省实行的每月发四十五斤米的口粮，余按市价折款发给的办法也可推行。
　　介休小学教师要求按工资米价改发货币
    编辑同志：
    山西省介休县解放后，小学教师的薪资由政府统筹发米。这在物价波动时期，对保证教师生活起到了很大的作用。但目前却因领发工资米手续麻烦及脱秤等损失，增加了教师负担，且耽误教学工作。如农村教师每月进城按单位集体领粮一次，各人分开后，再运到市场出售，每次起码得耽误三两天时间。经过三翻四倒，每份教师粮以一百五十斤计算，即可能脱秤十二、三斤。特别是全县教师粮同时上市，致使米价低落，如普通米每斤可卖七百五十元，而“教师米”却只能售五百七十元，无形中减低了教师待遇，增加了教师生活与思想上的负担。
    我们代表全县教师向政府建议，应该依照机关、公营工矿企业部门每月按折价办法，一视同仁地发款给小学教师。这样不仅克服了领发薪米中的困难和损失，而且可以不影响教学工作。

　　潍坊小学教师要求提高工资米价
    编辑同志：
    我想告诉你关于小学教师生活方面的一些情况：
    山东潍坊市小学教师的工资是按小米计算，每人平均月薪二百斤米左右。一月份薪粮是按七百元一斤发给，工资最高的可发款十五万元左右。但同仁们的家庭负担一般是四至六口人，最多的有九口人，靠薪资收入维持生活是相当困难的。
    可是，全市除小学教员外，都按财政米价一、○五○元发薪，这些情况虽一再向工会反映，但没有任何结果。
    同仁们都能体会到目前政府的财经困难，不要求改善待遇，因为这样就要影响国家的开支。但我们认为小学教师的生活问题也应适当解决，否则将影响到我们的教学工作。此致敬礼

　　三河县以小豆折米发薪小学教师吃亏太大
    编辑同志：
    我想教师是应该专业化的，但我县绝大部分教员却缺乏或根本没有这种思想准备。经我仔细了解，他们工作情绪不高与小学教师待遇过低也有些关系。如一月份粮库发给教员的薪米，是以小豆一斤二两折合小米一斤发给的，而市价小米每斤为一千元，但小豆每斤价不到七百元，一斤二两小豆值不了八百元。一个初小教员每月薪资米是一百五十斤左右，而所领得的小豆还合不到一百二十斤小米，这个差额对于小学教员来说不能算小。如果经常这样下去，必然会影响到教师同志们的工作情绪。
