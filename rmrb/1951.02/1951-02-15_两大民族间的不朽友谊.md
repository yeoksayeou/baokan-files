　　The Immortal Friendship Between Two Great Nations
　　C· Gerasimov, Famous Soviet Film Director and Stalin Prize Winner

　　The signing of the historic Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been over a year. This treaty marks a new era in the development of friendship between our two great nations.

　　This friendship was left to us by Lenin. The Soviet people, faithful to Lenin's behests, are victoriously building a communist society under the leadership of the great Stalin. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its long-tested leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, forever free from the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, are building a new and powerful China.

　　Our great friendship, growing day by day, further strengthens the camp of peace and justice. From Moscow to Beijing there are millions of miles, but our two great nations are advancing shoulder to shoulder in the same ranks of defending peace, its standard-bearer is the great Stalin. The majority of mankind is advancing in this rank, and no matter how rampant Truman, Churchill, and other running dogs of Wall Street and the City of London are, they cannot extinguish the powerful and irresistible movement towards peace.

　　Dear Chinese friends! We watch your success with intense affection. We celebrate the success of the People's Republic of China together with the Chinese workers who have tasted the joy of free labor for the first time, with the Chinese farmers who are cultivating their own land for the first time, and with the intellectuals who are dedicating all their strength to the happiness of the free people. We are proud of the brilliant victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who stand shoulder to shoulder with their Korean brothers in defending the independence of Korea and the security of their own country, and in defending the great and noble cause of peace throughout the world.

　　We rejoice in the close cooperation between our two great nations in the political, economic, and cultural fields. As a film director, I would like to emphasize the obvious example of cooperation in the cultural field, namely the jointly produced documentary "Liberated China". This film has been warmly welcomed by Soviet audiences. I would like to take this opportunity to greet my Chinese colleagues.

　　Our two great nations have common loves and hates. We love peaceful and constructive labor and hate those war instigators who commit despicable crimes in Korea and occupy Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Soviet people believe that historical justice will surely prevail, and that the Chinese people will completely liberate their country from the hands of imperialist murderers and robbers.

　　We believe that the Chinese people, relying on the support of the entire camp of peace and democracy, and first of all on the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, will achieve many new successes in the cause of political, economic and cultural construction.

　　May the immortal friendship of our two great nations last forever and be consolidated!

　　两大民族间的不朽友谊
    苏联著名电影导演斯大林奖金获奖人　C·格拉西莫夫
    历史性的中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订已经过了一年了。这一条约标志着我们两大民族友谊发展的新时代。
    列宁遗留给我们这一友谊。忠实于列宁遗嘱的苏维埃人民，在伟大的斯大林领导下胜利地建设着共产主义社会。在中国共产党及其久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导下，永远摆脱了帝国主义及封建主义的压迫的中国人民，建设着新的强大的中国。
    我们的与日俱增的伟大友谊，更巩固了和平、正义的阵营。从莫斯科到北京有千万里路，但我们两大民族却在同一保卫和平的行列中并肩前进，它的旗手是伟大的斯大林。大多数的人类在这个行列中前进着，不论杜鲁门、邱吉尔以及华尔街和伦敦城区的其他走狗们怎样猖獗，他们不能消灭走向和平的强大而不可抗拒的运动。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！我们紧张地亲切地注视着你们的成功。我们和第一次领会了自由劳动的快乐的中国工人在一起，和第一次耕种着自己的土地的中国农民在一起，和将自己的全部力量奉献给自由人民的幸福的知识分子在一起欢庆中华人民共和国的成功。我们为中国人民志愿军的显赫胜利而骄傲，他们和朝鲜兄弟们肩并肩地保卫着朝鲜的独立和自己祖国的安全，并保卫了全世界伟大的崇高的和平事业。
    我们为我们两大民族在政治上、经济上、文化上的紧密合作而喜悦。作为电影导演的我，想强调指出那一文化领域内合作的明显例子，即共同制作的文献片《解放了的中国》。这部影片受到苏维埃观众的热烈欢迎。我要趁此问候我的中国同事们。
    我们两大民族有共同的爱和恨。我们热爱和平建设性的劳动并仇恨那些在朝鲜制造卑劣罪行和侵占自古以来就是中国领土的台湾的战争挑拨者。苏维埃人民相信，历史正义定会胜利，而中国人民将使自己的国家自帝国主义杀人犯与强盗手中完全解放出来。
    我们相信，中国人民，依靠着整个和平民主阵营的支持，首先是苏联的兄弟般的、无私的帮助，将在政治的、经济的和文化的建设事业上获得许多新的成功。
    祝我们两大民族的不朽友谊永存与巩固！
