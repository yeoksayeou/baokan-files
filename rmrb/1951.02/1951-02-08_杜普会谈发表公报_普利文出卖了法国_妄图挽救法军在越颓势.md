　　The Dupa-Truman Talks Issue Communiqué
    Pleven Betrays France
    Attempting to Salvage the Declining French Army in Vietnam
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 4th] French Prime Minister Pleven and US President Truman held talks in Washington on January 29th and 30th. The main purpose of Pleven's visit to the United States was to beg for American "aid" to salvage the declining French invasion army in Vietnam.
    The official communiqué issued after the talks showed that the French ruling clique, in order to get Truman to agree to increase and expedite the shipment of military aid to Vietnam to assist the French colonial army, has further betrayed France. Under Truman's pressure, Pleven has announced his complete agreement with the United States to continue its war of aggression against Korea; announced his agreement that West Germany should join the North Atlantic aggressive military bloc established single-handedly by American imperialism; he promised to conclude the Schuman Plan treaty as soon as possible, completely selling out the coal and steel industries of France and West Germany to the United States; and promised "never to lose any opportunity to step up rearmament."
    However, despite the communiqué's repeated emphasis on "agreement" between the United States and France, the New York Herald Tribune, according to a United Press dispatch from New York on the 30th, revealed that "many differences exist between the two countries." Despite the communiqué being full of promises, it did little to help solve practical difficulties. Even on the Vietnam issue, according to United Press, because the United States is "deeply involved in the Korean and Chinese situations," and is exhausted, "it is now apparently unable to bear the burden of another major conflict." The bleak prospects for the French war of aggression in Vietnam have forced a United Press reporter to lament: "France is waging a war in the Far East that is difficult to win." As for the issue of West Germany joining the North Atlantic aggressive army, the New York Herald Tribune admitted that it "remains a thorny issue"; and American warmongers' fear of the French people's powerful forces "hindering defense (should be read as aggression) efforts" cannot even be concealed by United Press.

### 杜普会谈发表公报  普利文出卖了法国  妄图挽救法军在越颓势

　　杜普会谈发表公报
    普利文出卖了法国     
    妄图挽救法军在越颓势
    【新华社四日讯】法国总理普利文和美国总统杜鲁门于一月二十九、三十两日在华盛顿举行会谈。普利文这次赴美的主要目的，是乞求美国的“援助”以挽救在越南的法国侵略军的颓势。
    会谈结束后发表的官方公报显示：法国统治集团为了求得杜鲁门答应增加并加速运送军援物资赴越南援助法国殖民军，已进一步地出卖了法国。在杜鲁门的压力下，普利文已宣布完全同意美国继续进行对朝鲜的侵略战争；宣布同意西德参加美帝国主义一手建立的北大西洋侵略军事集团；他答应早日缔结把法国和西德的煤、钢工业完全出卖给美国的舒曼计划条约；并答应“决不失去任何机会来加紧重整军备”。
    然而，尽管公报一再强调美、法两国“意见一致”，据合众社纽约三十日讯，纽约先驱论坛报却透露了“两国间存在着许多分歧”。尽管公报上诺言满纸，但是，对解决实际困难却没有什么帮助。就是在越南问题上，据合众社透露，也因美国“深深卷入朝鲜和中国局势中”，精疲力竭，“现在显然不能够再承担一次大冲突的负担”了。法国在越南的侵略战争的黯淡前景，合众社记者也不得不悲叹道：“法国正在远东进行一场难以取胜的战争。”至于使西德参加北大西洋侵略军的问题，纽约先驱论坛报承认：“仍然是棘手的问题”；而美国战争贩子对法国人民强大的力量“妨碍国防（应读为侵略）努力”的恐惧，连合众社也无法掩饰。
