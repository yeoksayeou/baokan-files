Xinhua News Agency, Cairo: Su Younong, the representative of China attending the joint meeting of the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union and the International Air Transport Association, issued a statement at the meeting on January 25, refuting the obstruction of the Chinese representative's attendance by the US representative.

Su Younong's statement was supported by the representatives of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. After debate, the meeting passed a resolution recognizing the Chinese representative as the sole legitimate representative of China at this meeting. The so-called "representative" of the Kuomintang reactionaries was expelled from the venue. The US conspiracy suffered a shameful defeat.

When severely criticizing the US proposal, Su Younong said: "This fact once again points out that a small group of representatives of US monopoly capitalists who stubbornly insist on being hostile to the 475 million Chinese people are stubbornly attempting to prevent the People's Republic of China from obtaining a legitimate position in all international organizations, and to obstruct the cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the above-mentioned organizations, even in a purely technical organization like the Universal Postal Union, where the issue of the People's Republic of China's right to representation has already been resolved. As early as before the Montreux meeting of the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, telegraphed the Secretary-General of the Committee on May 5, 1950, stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people, and the so-called 'representative' of the Kuomintang reactionaries is no longer qualified to participate in any meeting of the Universal Postal Union and must be expelled from the Universal Postal Union. This existing fact and this reasonable request have been officially recognized by the resolution of the Montreux meeting, and have also been affirmed by the facts that the representative of the People's Republic of China was invited to attend the above-mentioned meeting and that the Kuomintang reactionaries were expelled from the venue. After the Montreux meeting, the postal authorities of the People's Republic of China, at the request of the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union and with the approval of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, accepted the International Postal Convention. This fact further solidified the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Universal Postal Union."

Su Younong then rebuked the United Nations General Assembly resolution of December 14, 1950, cited by the US representative as an excuse, saying: "As for the resolution on the representation of member states adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1950, it is itself illegal because this resolution violates the principles of respecting the political independence and autonomy of all countries stipulated in the United Nations Charter. In fact, the passage of the above-mentioned resolution was the result of the illegal manipulation of the US delegation, so it is illegal and invalid. Furthermore, this resolution was illegally passed without the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China and after the People's Republic of China had established formal relations with the Universal Postal Union. This meeting has nothing to discuss regarding this resolution at all and should not be influenced by these political conspiracies."

Su Younong finally solemnly declared: "The delegation of the People's Republic of China insists that the so-called issue of Chinese representation simply does not exist. The representative of the People's Republic of China is the only representative qualified to represent China at this meeting and all other meetings of the Universal Postal Union."

　　苏幼农在万国邮联执委会上痛斥美帝阻我出席阴谋
    【新华社讯】开罗消息：我国出席万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会与国际航空运输协会的联席会议的代表苏幼农，曾在该会议的一月二十五日会议上发表声明，驳斥美国代表阻挠我国代表出席会议。
    苏幼农的声明获得苏联及捷克斯洛伐克代表的支持。会议经辩论后通过承认我国代表为本届会议中的唯一合法的中国代表。而国民党反动派残余集团的所谓“代表”就被驱逐出会场。美国的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。
    苏幼农于严斥美国提案时说：“这一事实再一次地指明了：一小撮坚持与四亿七千五百万中国人民为敌的美国独占资本家的代表们，固执地企图阻挠中华人民共和国在所有国际组织中取得合法的地位，并阻挠中华人民共和国与上述组织之间的合作，甚至于在像万国邮政联盟这样一个纯技术性的机构中也是如此，而中华人民共和国在这一机构里的代表权问题却是早已解决了的。早在万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会蒙特罗会议之前，中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来于一九五○年五月五日致电委员会秘书长称：中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，中国国民党反动派残余集团的所谓“代表”，现在已没有参加万国邮政联盟任何会议的资格，必须将其从万国邮政联盟中驱逐出去。这一存在的事实和这一合理的要求，已为蒙特罗会议的决议所正式承认，并且也为中华人民共和国代表被邀出席上述会议以及国民党反动派残余集团当场被驱逐出去的这些事实所肯定。蒙特罗会议后，中华人民共和国邮政当局应万国邮政联盟国际局之请，并经中华人民共和国中央人民政府批准，已接受了国际邮政公约。这一事实更加固定了中华人民共和国和万国邮政联盟之间的关系。”
    苏幼农继而斥责美国代表引为借口的联合国大会一九五○年十二月十四日的决议案称：“至于一九五○年十二月十四日联合国大会所通过的关于会员国代表权的决议，本身即是非法的，因为这个决议违反了联合国宪章中所规定的尊重各国的政治独立与自主的原则。事实上，上述决议的通过是美国代表团非法操纵的结果，因此它是非法和无效的。此外，这个决议是在没有中华人民共和国代表的参加下、和在中华人民共和国已与万国邮政联盟建立正式关系之后所非法通过的。本会对于这个决议根本没有什么可以讨论的，并且不应为这些政治阴谋所影响。”
    苏幼农最后严正宣称：“中华人民共和国代表团坚持所谓中国代表权的问题根本不存在，中华人民共和国的代表是唯一有资格代表中国出席这次会议以及一切其他万国邮政联盟会议的代表。”
