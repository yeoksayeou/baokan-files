　　Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League
　　Trial Implementation of the Study Counselor System
    [Report from this newspaper] Since June of last year, the Northeast Committee of the New Democratic Youth League has been piloting the study counselor (formerly known as propagandist) system. According to preliminary statistics, Youth League committees in various parts of Northeast China now have 2,730 study counselors. The work in factories is better in Shenyang. All state-owned and public factories in Shenyang have universally established study counselors, totaling 330, who have given more than 300 Youth League lessons. The Northeast Railway Bureau Youth League Committee has begun to systematically conduct propaganda and education for Youth League members. The "Talks on the Youth League Constitution" have generally been given five or more sessions, with more than 16,600 Youth League members participating. In rural areas, the Youth League committees of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi provinces have successively established teaching station systems. According to statistics from 18 counties in Heilongjiang Province, 134 teaching stations have been established, with a total of 1,376 study counselors, who have generally given three to seven Youth League lessons. In addition to piloting study counselors in some factories and suburban rural areas, Harbin has also established a system in six important agencies where study counselors give Youth League lessons on a regular basis.
    This regular and systematic education has played a significant role in improving the political consciousness of Youth League members and youth, enhancing the organizational nature and discipline of Youth League members, and improving the organizational life of the Youth League; thereby powerfully promoting the current central work.
    The candidates for study counselors in various places are determined by the Youth League general branch or branch and approved by the higher-level Youth League committee. The working method of study counselors is generally to develop an outline based on the lecture outline issued by the higher level, combined with the actual situation of the Youth League members in the local area, such as cultural, political level, and ideological situation, and give lectures and organize discussions for the Youth League members. The study counselors work under the leadership of the Youth League committee to which they belong. In addition to discussing and determining various study systems, such as roll call, discussion, and examination, the Youth League branch also assists the study counselors in improving the content of the lectures and the teaching methods.

　　青年团东北委员会
　　试建学习辅导员制
    【本报讯】新民主主义青年团东北委员会，自去年六月试建学习辅导员（以前名宣传员）制度以来，据初步统计，东北各地青年团委员会现已有学习辅导员二千七百三十人。在工厂中以沈阳市作的较好。沈阳市各国营和公营工厂都已普遍建立了学习辅导员，共计三百三十名，已讲授团课三百多次。东北铁路局青年团委员会已开始有系统地对青年团员进行宣传教育。《团章讲话》一般的已讲了五节以上，参加听讲的青年团员有一万六千六百余人。在农村中，青年团黑龙江、松江、辽东、辽西等省委员会都先后建立了传授站制度。据黑龙江省十八个县的统计，已建立起一百三十四个传授站，共有学习辅导员一千三百七十六名，一般的已讲过三次到七次团课。哈尔滨市除在一部分工厂和郊区农村中试建学习辅导员外，并在六个重要机关中建立了以定期由学习辅导员上团课的制度。
    这种经常的有系统的教育，对提高团员和青年的政治觉悟，增强团员的组织性和纪律性，改善团的组织生活等方面都起了很大的作用；从而有力地推动了当前的中心工作。
    各地学习辅导员人选都由青年团总支部或支部确定，并经上级青年团委员会批准。学习辅导员的工作方法一般是根据上级发的讲课提纲，结合当地团员的实际情形，如文化、政治水平、思想情况等，编出提纲，给团员讲课与组织讨论。学习辅导员都是在所属青年团委员会的领导下进行工作的。青年团支部除经过讨论定出各种学习制度，如点名、讨论、考试等外，并协助学习辅导员改进讲课的内容和教学的方式、方法等。
