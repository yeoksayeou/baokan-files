Propagandist Work

　　How Propagandist Yang Chunhua Overcame Difficulties
    Bai Tianming
    In May 1950, the Jixi Coal Mine District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party notified all branches: "Select outstanding party members who have connections with the masses to be propagandists, to publicize the party's policies and encourage the production enthusiasm of the workers." The secretary of the Didao Pit branch, while looking at the notice, immediately thought of one person – Yang Chunhua, the statistician who had started the workers' spare-time cultural studies and had recently been selected as a first-class model worker in the entire mining area.
    After Yang Chunhua became a propagandist, he thought his job was just to write blackboard newspapers. He regularly put out a blackboard newspaper every week as usual. But the number of people who read the blackboard newspaper was the same as before, only a few scattered individuals.
    One afternoon, the coal pit suddenly "collapsed," and all the coal mining equipment was buried inside. When the pit leader heard about this, he immediately put down his work to rescue it; but after the pit leader went down the pit and asked everyone to help, no one paid attention and just kept their heads down to dig coal. It turned out that the workers were paid by the piece, and no one wanted to lose work and earn less money. The pit leader, in a fit of pique, worked alone for two hours. When the pit leader came out of the pit, covered in sweat, he walked into the office and saw Yang Chunhua. He didn't even bother to wipe his sweat and began to complain: "You spend all day writing blackboard newspapers and publicizing, what's the use?! The workers only know how to dig more coal to earn more money. If you can promote coal production, then you'll be considered capable!" An old worker next to him chimed in: "The workers are like mutes eating dumplings, they know what's in their hearts; beating and scolding didn't work during the puppet Manchukuo period, and now further encouragement is useless!"
    After work, Yang Chunhua didn't even write the blackboard newspaper, and rushed back to his dormitory, taking two steps at a time. The pit leader's words and the old worker's words kept swirling in his ears. He thought to himself: If the administration doesn't pay attention and the workers don't support it, won't it collapse if I continue like this? If things get bad, I might as well just stop and let whoever wants to do it do it. But under the encouragement of the branch secretary and other comrades, he had to reluctantly put out the blackboard newspaper on time.
    One evening, Yang Chunhua took out the big gold star fountain pen that the bureau had awarded him, which he had been reluctant to use, from the drawer. Picking up the pen, he remembered how excited he was when he received the award, and how even more pleased he was when he saw his model deeds published in the newspaper, so happy that he couldn't even sleep. After receiving the award, he had indeed worked even harder. But thinking about his work these past few days, he really felt ashamed. Suddenly, he also thought: If the rewards were added to the workers, wouldn't they be even more enthusiastic about production?! He was determined to improve his working methods. But what else should a propagandist do besides writing blackboard newspapers? He didn't know, so he had to read newspapers from various places every day to find other people's propaganda experiences. One day, Yang Chunhua suddenly saw a news item in the newspaper praising the propaganda and mobilization work of the Changchun Tram Factory. He read it from beginning to end, but was very disappointed after reading it, there were too few specific materials in the article! Yang Chunhua immediately wrote a letter to the Changchun Tram Factory to ask. The next day, as luck would have it, he had something to go home for, so he took the opportunity to detour to Changchun to ask the tram factory for advice. The comrades at the Changchun Tram Factory enthusiastically told Yang Chunhua four experiences: (1) Carry out propaganda based on the psychology of the workers; (2) When starting propaganda work, give more praise and less criticism to the masses; (3) Use your own brain more and think of new methods anytime, anywhere; (4) Strengthen education for backward workers. Yang Chunhua cherished these experiences as if they were treasures, and repeatedly muttered them to himself along the way.
    After Yang Chunhua came back, he tried to make the blackboard newspaper attract more readers. At first, he drew flowers around the blackboard newspaper, but the number of people who read it was still as small as before. Yang Chunhua thought that maybe everyone was unhappy to read the criticism articles. So the blackboard newspaper only published news of high output and good attendance of a certain group... news of praise. After a few more issues, the number of readers still didn't increase. Yang Chunhua thought again: This must be because it's published every seven days, and the workers feel that the time is too long. He immediately shortened the blackboard newspaper to once every five days; but the situation still hadn't improved. It was changed to once every three days, once a day, but not only did the number of people not increase, but it actually decreased more and more. Yang Chunhua simply changed the blackboard newspaper to two or three issues a day. In this way, he firmly believed that the content was novel and the workers would definitely be willing to read it. But on the contrary, not even a shadow of a person could be seen in front of the blackboard newspaper, and some workers even didn't even turn their heads when passing by. This wasn't right, that wasn't right, and Yang Chunhua was completely puzzled, unable to figure it out at all. At this time, he remembered the experience of the Changchun Tram Factory. Taking advantage of dinner, he talked to a worker who often read the blackboard newspaper. The worker said: "Who wants to drink the northwest wind outside in the cold weather?" Only then did Yang Chunhua understand that it was already October (last year), and the workers ran as fast as they could when going to and from work, wanting to get into the house to warm up by the fire as soon as possible. Who would want to stand in the cold and read the blackboard newspaper?! So he decided to change the blackboard newspaper to a wall newspaper, and use a large piece of white paper to paste it in the shift change room.
    As a result, the situation improved, and every day there were always forty or fifty people reading the wall newspaper during the three shifts. But there were hundreds of workers in one pit, and dozens of people reading the wall newspaper was still too few. As soon as it was time for the workers to change shifts, Yang Chunhua would go to the wall newspaper to observe carefully. He found that the people who read the wall newspaper were always those few people. He was very puzzled, so he went to ask the workers again. Yang Chunhua walked into the shift change room, just in time for the payment of wages, and all the workers were there. He shouted to everyone: "Now the wall newspaper is written on paper, everyone come and see it!" The workers were not interested in his words, and no one answered. He shouted a few more times, and a worker finally said: "We are uneducated, we can't read a single word, isn't it a waste of time for a blind man to light a lamp to go to the wall newspaper!"
    Yang Chunhua suddenly realized, and immediately thought: "The workers don't know how to read, but they can always understand pictures." The next day, he turned the wall newspaper into a picture newspaper. Since the wall newspaper was changed to a picture newspaper, there were always crowds of people in front of the picture newspaper when it was time to change shifts; those who came late and were short all stood on chairs to watch; those who couldn't read urged those who could to explain. Sometimes if the picture newspaper was changed a little slowly, the workers would urge Yang Chunhua: "Aren't you going to change to a new one?"
    "Change to a new one" made Yang Chunhua embarrassed again: Where could he find so many patterns to change after a long time? It just so happened that a worker sent a report form, and when Yang Chunhua saw that the output was too low, he casually encouraged the worker: "You have to work harder!" The worker said: "You can't catch up even if you're on a plane!" These words reminded him, and he immediately drew a plane, a car, and a rickshaw, and wrote the names of the groups with high output below the plane, and the names of the groups with low output below the rickshaw. After the workers saw the picture, no one wanted to pull the rickshaw, they all wanted to ride in the plane, so each group started to compete...
    Because of the competition, many workers were injured by coal but did not stop working. When Yang Chunhua saw that each group was only concerned with production and neglected safety work, accidents were bound to happen if they continued like this. He promptly drew a comic strip, with all the matters needing attention drawn in separate panels, and posted a slogan: "No matter how much your output increases, any accident will erase all your previous achievements." After the workers read it, they all automatically followed the operating procedures.
    As soon as the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement began, Yang Chunhua immediately composed a quick rhyme:
        Truman  is a real bastard
        Came to Korea  to make trouble
        The Volunteer Army  went to join the war
        Beat him till his flag fell and his soldiers scattered
        Comrades  work harder
        Produce more coal to stand up to bombs
    The workers recited the quick rhyme, and the more they dug coal, the more energetic they became. But there were still a small number of backward workers who did not actively participate in the competition. Yang Chunhua used an enlightening approach and drew a picture of a conference to reward labor models. In the picture, advanced workers wore glorious flowers and sat on the rostrum; backward workers stood under the stage with their heads down, and gave it a name called "Think of a Way." After the backward workers saw the picture, they saw that they were standing under the stage, which was really embarrassing. So they all "thought of a way" to increase production, and all the workers in the pit participated in the competition.
    As soon as the backward workers made progress, Yang Chunhua immediately praised them to consolidate their achievements. The worker Yang Ciyun, who had been consistently backward for three years, suddenly increased his output to the first in the entire pit during the competition. Yang Chunhua immediately composed a quick rhyme and posted it:
        Yang Ciyun  is really good  一心要得大红旗 Wants to get the big red flag with all his heart
        Last month  was not active  Passed the time muddleheadedly
        Not angry  not anxious  闹脾气 Made a fuss all day long
        This month challenged the right enemy  He's the first in the entire pit in the first ten days
        Don't look down on him for being backward before  Now you have to learn from him
    From October to the end of the year (last year), the workers' energy was like a hemp rope, the tighter it was twisted. The production task exceeded 50 percent on average every month. Yang Chunhua's propaganda and mobilization work played a significant role here. The pit leader said to him when he saw him: "Really great! You finally promoted the coal production." But Yang Chunhua was not satisfied, and continued to study his work tirelessly, determined to do his work even better.

　　宣传员杨春华怎样克服困难
    白天明
    中共鸡西煤矿区委员会在一九五○年五月间，通知各支部：“选择与群众有联系的、优秀的党员作宣传员，宣传党的政策，鼓励职工群众的生产热情。”滴道坑支部书记一面看着通知，一面就想起一个人来——曾经把工人业余文化学习搞起来，最近又被评选为全矿区一等模范的统计员杨春华。
    杨春华当了宣传员，他以为自己的工作就是写写黑板报。他就照例地每周出一期黑板报。但是看黑板报的人和往常一样，稀稀落落只有几个。
    一天下午，煤坑突然“冒了顶”（塌了），采煤的设备全被压在里面。坑长听到这情况马上放下工作去抢救；可是坑长下坑之后，喊大家帮忙，大家都不理，低着头只顾刨煤。原来工人们是按件计资的，谁也不愿意误工少挣钱。坑长一赌气，一个人干了两个钟头。坑长从坑里出来，满身冒着热气走进了办公室，正好看见了杨春华，他连汗也不顾擦，就埋怨起来：“你成天写黑板报、宣传顶啥用？！工人只知道刨煤多挣钱，你若是宣传出煤来才算有本事！”旁边一个老工人也接上说：“工人是哑叭吃饺子，心里有数；伪满时打骂都不顶用，现在再鼓动也是白搭！”
    下了班后，杨春华连黑板报也没写，一步变成两步地跑回了宿舍。坑长的话、老工人的话，一直在他耳边转。他心里想：行政上不重视，工人们不拥护，若总是这样干下去还不垮台？如果闹不好，不如干脆住手，谁愿意干谁干。可是在支部书记及其他同志的鼓动下，他又不得不勉强地按期出黑板报。
    一天晚上，杨春华把局里奖给他的一直舍不得使的大金星钢笔从抽屉里翻出来。拿起笔，他想起发奖时自己兴奋得不知所措，后来见到报上登出自己的模范事迹，更高兴得连觉也睡不着。受奖以后，自己工作确实也更加卖劲了。但是想到这几天的工作，心里实在觉得抱愧。忽然，他又联想到：如果把奖励加在工人头上，他们不是也会更起劲的生产吗？！他决心要改进自己的工作方法。但是宣传员除了写黑板报以外，还应当作些什么呢？他却又不知道了，只得每天翻看各地的报纸，找别人的宣传经验。有一天，杨春华突然看到报上登了一条表扬长春电车厂宣传鼓动工作的消息。他从头看到尾，看完之后却很失望，文章里面具体材料太少了！杨春华马上就给长春电车厂写信去问。第二天，可巧他有事要回家，他就趁机绕道到长春向电车厂去请教。长春电车厂的同志热情地告诉杨春华四条经验：（一）根据工人心理进行宣传；（二）开始做宣传工作时，对群众要多表扬少批评；（三）自己多用脑子，随时随地想新办法；（四）对落后的工人，要加强教育。杨春华如获至宝，一路上自己反复地叨念着。
    杨春华回来后，就想办法使黑板报能吸引更多的读者。开始他在黑板报的周围画上了花，可是看的人仍然和往常一样少。杨春华想可能登了批评稿子，大家不高兴看。于是黑板报上只登某小组产量高、出勤好……表扬的消息。又出了几期之后，看的人仍不见增加。杨春华又想：这一定是因为七天出一期，工人感到时间长。他马上把黑板报缩短为五天一期；可是情况还没改进。又改成三天一期，一天一期，人不但不增加，反而越来越减少了。杨春华索性把黑板报改为一天出两期、三期。这样，他满以为内容新颖，工人一定愿意看。但是恰恰相反，黑板报前连个人影也见不到，甚至有的工人从旁走过时，头都不歪。这也不是，那也不是，可把杨春华装进闷葫芦里去了，一点也摸不着头脑。这时，他想起了长春电车厂的经验。趁着吃晚饭，他找了一个经常看黑板报的工人谈起来。工人说：“大冷的天，谁愿意在外边喝西北风？”杨春华这才明白，现在（说话的时候）已经是十月（去年）了，工人上下班都飞跑，想早点进屋烤火，谁还挨冷看黑板报呢？！于是他决定把黑板报改为墙报，用一张大白纸贴在换班的屋里。
    这样一来，情况好转了，每天三班总有四、五十个人看墙报。但是一个坑口就有好几百工人，几十人看墙报还是太少。杨春华一到工人换班时，就去墙报旁边留心观察。他发现：看墙报的总是那几个人。他很纳闷，就再去问工人。杨春华走到交班屋里，正赶上发工薪，工人全来齐了。他就向大家大喊：“现在墙报是用纸写的，大家快来看啊！”工人对他的话不感兴趣，没有一个人回答。他接着又喊了几声，一个工人才说：“咱们大老粗，两眼漆黑，斗大的字不识一石，去看墙报还不是瞎子点灯白费蜡！”
    杨春华恍然大悟，马上想到：“工人不识字，画总能看得懂。”第二天，他就把墙报变成画报。自从墙报换成画报，一到换班的时候，画报前总是挤得满满的人；来晚的，个小的，都站在椅子上看；不识字的催着识字的给讲。有时画报换的慢一点，工人就去催问杨春华：“还不换新的？”
    “换新的”又使杨春华为了难：日久天长那里有许多花样可变？也巧，一个工人送来表报，杨春华一看产量太少，顺口鼓励那工人一句：“要加劲干哪！”工人说：“坐飞机也赶不上！”这句话提醒了他，马上就画了个飞机、汽车、人力车，再把产量多的班写到飞机下面，少的写到人力车下面。工人看见画后，谁也不愿意拉人力车，都想坐飞机，于是各班挑起战来……
    因为挑了战，许多工人被煤砸伤了也不歇工。杨春华一看各班只顾生产忽略了安全工作，继续下去一定要出事故。他就及时地画了一张连环画，需要注意的事项都分幅画出来，又贴上一副标语：“不论你产量怎样提高，发生事故前功一笔勾消。”工人看了之后，都自动地按着操作规程去作了。
    抗美援朝运动一开始，杨春华马上编了一首快板：
        杜鲁门  真混蛋
        到朝鲜  来捣乱
        志愿军  去参战
        打他旗倒兵又散
        同志们  加油干
        多出煤炭顶炸弹
    工人们念着快板，刨起煤来越干越起劲。可是还有一小部分落后的工人没积极参加竞赛。杨春华就用启发的方式，画了一幅奖励劳动模范大会的画。画上先进工人带着光荣花，坐在主席台上；落后的工人低着头站在台下，并起了个名字叫“想办法”。画贴出来后，落后工人一看，就是自己站在台下，真丢人。于是都纷纷“想办法”提高生产，全坑工人都参加了竞赛。
    落后的工人一有进步，杨春华马上就进行表扬以巩固他们的成绩。工人杨慈云，三年来一贯落后，竞赛时产量突然提高到全坑第一，杨春华马上编了一首快板贴出去：
        杨慈云  真不赖  一心要得大红旗
        上个月  不积极  稀理糊涂过了去
        不上火  不着急  成天成日闹脾气
        本月挑战对了敌  上旬全坑他第一
        别看从前落了后  现在还得向他来学习
    从十月到年底（去年），工人的劲头像股麻绳，越拧越紧。生产任务平均每月超过百分之五十。杨春华的宣传鼓动工作，在这里起了很大作用。坑长一见他就说：“真行！倒底把煤给宣传出来了。”可是杨春华没有满足，仍然不停歇地研究着他的工作，一心想把工作搞得更好。
