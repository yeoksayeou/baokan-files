　　National Agricultural Work Conference Opens in Beijing
　　Minister Li Shucheng proposes: This year, grain production should increase by 7.1%, cotton by 36.9%, and flue-cured tobacco leaves by 324.8%.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on the 14th of this month. The focus of this conference is to summarize and exchange work experiences from 1950, with emphasis on studying various measures to launch a large-scale production movement this year and to restore and develop agricultural production, and to specifically arrange the 1951 national agricultural production plan.
　　Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his opening speech: Last year, national agricultural production achieved great results, which was due to the correct leadership of governments at all levels and the active labor of the broad masses of peasants. Last year, national grain output increased by 10.8% compared to 1949, ginned cotton increased by 58.9%, and other special products such as hemp and tea also completed or exceeded the original plan. The above harvests have reversed the declining trend of my country's agricultural production since the Anti-Japanese War and have begun to lay the foundation for the development and improvement of my country's agriculture.
　　Minister Li continued: Agricultural production in 1951 needs to increase the production of more grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials. This year, the country needs to increase grain production by 7.1% on the basis of 1950, increase cotton production by 36.9%, and increase flue-cured tobacco leaves by 324.8%. Specific increase plans have also been formulated for other teas, tobacco leaves, etc.
　　After analyzing the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, Minister Li especially pointed out: In order to complete this year's major task of increasing agricultural production, this conference must clarify the approach to the work in 1951 and study and solve the following issues: First, how to mobilize the broad masses of peasants to launch a large-scale production movement; such as implementing production policies, organizing, carrying out mass technical improvement movements, and promoting labor models to conduct evaluations and competitions. Secondly, discuss various measures to develop agricultural production, such as farmland water conservancy, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, popularization of improved varieties, and promotion of agricultural tools. Finally, we will study and solve the organizational and leadership problems in agricultural production, including leadership ideology, organizational structure, and leadership relations.
　　In the past few days, representatives from various regions have exchanged successful experiences and provided specific opinions on issues such as implementing production policies, organizing labor mutual assistance, leading the masses to improve agricultural technology, and overcoming natural disasters during their reports at the meeting, which further strengthened the representatives' confidence in completing this year's task of increasing grain, cotton, and special crop production.
　　The conference was attended by 114 representatives from the agricultural and forestry departments of major administrative regions, the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces, and relevant departments of the Central People's Government; the meeting is expected to last ten days.

　　全国农业工作会议在京开幕        
    李书城部长提出：今年要增产粮食百分之七点一，棉花百分之三十六点九，烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八。
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府农业部召开的全国农业工作会议已于本月十四日在北京开幕。这次会议的中心是总结交流一九五○年的工作经验，着重研究开展今年大规模生产运动，和恢复发展农业生产的各项措施，具体布置一九五一年全国农业生产计划。
    中央人民政府农业部李书城部长在开幕词中指出：去年全国农业生产已获得伟大成绩，这是由于各级人民政府正确领导和广大农民群众积极劳动的结果。去年全国粮食产量较一九四九年增产百分之一十点八，皮棉增产百分之五十八点九，其他麻类、茶叶等特产也完成或超过了原订计划。上述收获，已扭转了抗战以来我国农业生产的下降趋势，并开始奠定了我国农业发展与提高的基础。
    李部长继提出：一九五一年的农业生产，需要增产更多的粮食、棉花和其他工业原料，今年全国要在一九五○年的基础上增产粮食百分之七点一，增产棉花百分之三十六点九，增产烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八，其他茶叶，烟叶等也拟定了具体的增产计划。
    李部长在分析了今年农业生产的有利条件后，特别指出：为了完成今年农业增产重大任务，这次会议必须明确一九五一年工作的做法，研究和解决如下几个问题：首先，如何发动广大农民，开展大规模的生产运动；如贯彻生产政策，组织起来，开展群众性的提高技术运动，以及推动劳动模范进行评比竞赛等。其次，讨论发展农业生产的各项措施，如农田水利，防治病虫害，畜牧兽医，普及良种和农具推广等。最后是研究解决农业生产中的组织和领导问题，包括领导思想、组织机构和领导关系等。
    连日会上，各地与会代表在汇报中，对贯彻生产政策，组织劳动互助，领导群众改良农业技术，克服自然灾害等问题，广泛地交换了成功的经验，提供了具体的意见，更加强了代表们完成今年粮棉与特产作物增产任务的信心。
    出席这次会议的有各大行政区农林部、各省农林厅和中央人民政府各有关部门等代表一一四人；会期预计十天。
