Domestic Art and Literature News

　　Since coming to Beijing in November of last year, Korean renowned dancer Choi Seung-hee has collaborated with Mei Lanfang, Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, and others to record and organize the basic movements of Qingyi, Huadan, Xiaosheng, and water sleeves in Chinese Peking Opera. She also plans to continue recording and organizing the basic movements of Wusheng, Wudan, and various dances using spears and sticks in Peking Opera, as well as the basic movements of waist drums and Yangko dances.
　　Recently, the Central Academy of Drama has established a Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Class, personally led by Choi Seung-hee. The purpose is to organize classical and folk dances of China and create people's dance art with rich Oriental national characteristics. This is a very meaningful task.
　　In addition, Choi Seung-hee and her daughter, Ahn Sung-hee, are preparing to create a dance drama with the theme of friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea.
　　The recent issues of *Saying and Singing* have published some works worthy of recommendation to readers. For example, the short story *Forever Will Not Forget You* by Bao Shen in the twelfth issue vividly depicts the story of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and an old Korean man in the fight against Japan. The short story *Old Zhao Tou is Back* by Meng Lang in the thirteenth issue tells the story of how a demobilized soldier returned to his hometown in Northeast China. The soldier sees the tremendous changes that have taken place in the coal mine where he used to work, and the miners are working actively and happily. The picture of the people's happy life and the painful memories of past persecution by the enemy and puppets show a strong contrast in the novel. *Living Person Pond* by Chen Dengke was serialized in the tenth to eleventh issues. This is an excellent novella. Although it still has some shortcomings, it is attractive as a whole, with rich content and full of emotion. It vividly depicts the battle of a village on the Subei Fuhuai Highway during the Liberation War. The close relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the people is reflected in this work in an extremely moving way.
　　The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Drama Observation Preliminary Competition, which lasted for sixteen days from December 23 last year to January 8 this year, had sixty-three performances, of which forty-four were created by the workers themselves, and more than half received favorable reviews. *Mass Art* Volume 5, Issue 3 of Shanghai (Special Issue on Shanghai Workers' Drama Observation Performance and Radio Performance) made a simple introduction to the excellent dramas selected in the preliminary round: *The Factory is the Battlefield* (drama, performed by State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 10), *Old Wang's Victory* (drama, performed by State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 15), *Change* (Yue Opera, performed by Pacific Weaving Factory), *On the Yalu River* (Huai Opera, performed by State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 1), *Mobilize* (drama, performed by East China Tax Printing Factory), and other twenty-two plays. Most of these works are combined with the current political task of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea. They show the creativity of the working class in literature and art, which should be valued and cultivated.

　　国内文艺动态
    朝鲜名舞蹈家崔承喜自去年十一月来京后，和梅兰芳、韩世昌、白云生等合作，已完成了纪录并整理中国京剧中的青衣、花旦、小生、水袖等舞蹈的基本动作，还准备继续纪录并整理武生、武旦以及京剧中各种用枪棍来舞蹈的基本动作，腰鼓和秧歌的基本动作等。
    最近中央戏剧学院已附设一崔承喜舞蹈研究班，由崔承喜亲自主持，目的在整理中国古典与民间的舞蹈，创造富有东方民族色彩的人民舞蹈艺术。这是一件极有意义的工作。
    另外，崔承喜及其女安圣姬等正准备创作一个以中朝人民友谊合作抗美援朝为主题的舞剧。
    《说说唱唱》最近几期发表了一些值得向读者推荐的作品。如第十二期中葆深作的短篇《永远不会忘记你》，生动地描写了东北抗日民主联军与一个朝鲜老汉的抗日故事。第十三期中孟浪作的短篇《老赵头回来了》，是叙述一个复员战士怎样回到他的故乡东北去的故事。那战士看到他过去曾经作过工的煤矿已经发生了巨大的变化，矿工们积极而愉快地劳动着。人民的幸福的生活的图景和过去受敌伪迫害的痛苦的记忆，在小说中显示了强烈的对比。第十期到第十一期连载了陈登科作的《活人塘》。这是一个出色的中篇小说，虽然它还有一些缺点，但整个说来它是吸引人的，内容充实，情绪饱满。它生动地描写了苏北阜淮公路上的一个村庄在解放战争中的战斗经过。解放军与人民的血肉相连的密切关系，在这作品中，获得了极其动人的反映。
    上海市工人戏剧观摩预赛，自去年十二月二十三日起至今年一月八日止，共十六天，六十三个演出节目中有四十四个是工人自己的创作，半数以上获得了好评。上海《群众文艺》五卷三期（上海工人戏剧观摩演出及广播表演特刊）对初选的优秀戏剧：《工厂就是战场》（话剧，国营棉纺织厂十厂演出）、《老王的胜利》（话剧，国营棉纺织厂十五厂演出）、《变》（越剧，太平洋织造厂演出）、《鸭绿江上》（淮剧，国营棉纺织厂一厂演出）、《动员起来》（话剧，华东税印厂演出）等二十二个戏作了简单的评介，这些作品多半是与当前的抗美援朝的政治任务相结合的。它们显示了工人阶级在文艺上的创造力，这种创造力是应当加以重视和培植的。
