	Third, On the Tasks of Rural Correspondents

	Comrades, it is very difficult to say something to the peasant correspondents, to give them some suggestions, because I think the work of peasant correspondents is particularly difficult. The question is who writes what. I think it is much easier to write about dance parties, diplomatic receptions, and conferences than to write about an ordinary rural event or a simple new phenomenon occurring in the countryside.

	Both diplomatic receptions and descriptions of rural events are difficult, but I think the latter is even more difficult than diplomatic receptions. There is a certain format here, and the description itself is simpler: So-and-so said something at such-and-such time... It is much more difficult to describe rural events. It should be made interesting to read, not dry and tasteless, but to the point. It should attract those who read it, not just skimming through the communication,... but be attracted by its vivid content.

	The correspondent himself should think thoroughly about what he wants to write. I have tried to write (I have written a lot of communications myself), and where you write simply—without emotion—it turns out very badly. It's hard. Only force yourself. Therefore, when you write a communication, you will feel that it will be dry. Whoever reads it will immediately feel that it is dry, this is a characteristic. It seems like there are many sentences in it, written not badly, but the reader still just skims through it. In order to write it well, the correspondent himself should be stirred by the desire to write, but of course, this cannot be done every time. Therefore, only those events that seriously attract the correspondent can be written.

	This is the first.

	I will only talk about my own opinions on the difficulties encountered when writing communications. Second, others will feel that at first glance... it seems very simple to go to the countryside and immediately write about houses, people, and all phenomena. But when you start, you will find how difficult it is. It is impossible to express a person's face in a few words. This requires rich emotion. But it also requires rich knowledge. Being a correspondent is not such a simple thing. Just pick it up—and write it out like flowing water. This cannot be done, you should learn a lot of things. Every communication, especially a long communication, must have life visible in it, but life must be seen in the human world. Therefore, if I write about forests, trees, household utensils, if all of these are written, you put a person in it here, and make him participate in the activity, make him think, do, feel, full of emotion (I am not talking about personal emotions, but common emotions). How to write characters into the communication is the most difficult question. When I write communications, I feel that the most difficult thing is to write characters into it. First, you must understand him, second, you must at least use two or three sentences to describe him. When we read Pushkin and Turgenev's works, we feel how easy it is! Pick it up and write it out. But when you write it yourself, you will find how difficult it is to use ten sentences to make the reader see a living person. But when you write it, if you don't describe him, then his actions become impossible. You should write in two or three sentences in such a way that the reader can grasp the character you are writing about, and what this person is doing. When you do this, then you will find that this is probably not an easy thing. However, writing communications requires doing many things and receiving much training. This profession—is one of the most difficult professions. No expert is required to have such skills as a correspondent is required to have. I say, as I feel, what is required of a correspondent first—is to make him good at feeling the emotions of the peasants he writes about.

	For example, if a correspondent wants to write about the demands of the peasants, then it must make it—this demand, attract him. If he writes about any event, he must have a close feeling for these events. This has already become part of future achievements. If it feels that he himself is closely concerned about these events, this will also be expressed in the communication.

	The second aspect of this question is that the correspondent should know the object he is writing about. It is very difficult to write about unfamiliar things. There is neither vocabulary nor anything to say—the result is a lot of empty talk. And our readers now require not to write empty talk, now you should, if you write about peasants, you should know what he is like. If you know him, then it will be easy to write. But the most important and main thing is that the correspondent should be proficient in the national language. I have read a lot of books, no less than any intellectual, and have also read the best classical works, I still feel that my national language is not good enough—so when I write, I feel that there are too few words. ... Good national language plays a great role, so correspondents are required to have a good understanding of the national language. ... In fact, a correspondent should be a creator, ... should have wisdom, he should thoroughly understand things, but only understanding is not enough, he should study more, so I think writing about rural life does not mean that he does not need to study.

	I pointed out at the beginning that it is easy to write about urban officialdom events, doing such things does not require special learning at all, but writing about rural life requires special learning. By learning, I do not mean that you should go to university, you should learn mathematics, etc. By learning, I mean that he (the correspondent) should be good at critically treating every question, he can analyze it from all aspects, he should have general common sense, not that he should be a mathematics expert. Sometimes even a mathematics expert is an utter layman in other things. Correspondents are required to be learned in all aspects, to have knowledge, to be able to see general phenomena from a small individual phenomenon. For example, when you come to the countryside—there are many events in the countryside... then you should make your work not be dry and tasteless, you should be good at choosing, on the one hand, it is a fact with universality, so that the facts written are not special facts, so that, when you are narrating it, other peasants read it and know that what the correspondent is writing here is what they are doing there every day. At the same time, this writing should seem that the correspondent has pointed out some fresh things in this life. If you only repeat life superficially, then what you repeat seems like old things. Obviously, people don't do anything new every day, people eat today, and they still eat tomorrow, the process of eating is the same every day, but in fact this process is not the same at all. Is your eating today the same as yesterday? Or is tomorrow—like today? Of course not, today's life—this is not yesterday's life, otherwise people would not change, people should be the same, we grow first, then age to death. People are not static for a second in life. Therefore, if we write about life, then the communication must not make people feel that it points out old things. Grasping life—this is the most difficult thing for a correspondent.

	It should be written about things that exist in life, for example, now you go to the street and see life on the street, you should grasp this life and write it on paper. Then when you try to write it on paper, it is not life, but wood, because you have not expressed it in the process, in the movement, but it seems that you have expressed it in a fixed place, you are writing about a dead body, not human life.

	This is the most difficult problem facing correspondents. I think, this wisdom—the wisdom of being good at describing life—it exists in human nature, it is not created by people, when people write something, the result is often as if he has killed life, as if it has stopped. Therefore, when life cannot be grasped, the communication is always a boring thing, although you write it very beautifully. …………

	Sometimes I see a ten-line communication, I think, this person was excited and boiling when he wrote ten lines, and you feel it between the lines, and you are surprised when you read this communication: "Look, how excited this young man is." This is the task of the correspondent. I personally think that a correspondent, when he has sacred wisdom, and if a wise correspondent describes peasant affairs, it will be read even in the most fashionable and gorgeous living room—life is attractive, no matter where it is. There is no special peasant creation. Some people say that peasants need a special language, sweet and greasy. This is nonsense. Peasants like ordinary, good, normal national language. And normal national language comes from studying national language, therefore, all correspondents should study national language well. I can say that I have read a lot of books. I am now in the highest position in the country, if someone asks me what I lack, I will say that my national language is too bad, I always feel that I know too little national language. So the task of every correspondent—is to study national language. Many people think that when he studies national language, he will lose the peasant language. This is not right. Peasants speak Russian like other people. On the contrary, whoever's national language is not good will not speak the peasant language.

	Please read the best Russian classical works. For example, Pushkin, it seems that this writer is writing for the "upper class." Or—Turgenev. Please read his "Hunter's Notes" or any of his novels. You will find how simple and understandable his language is; you read such a novel to a simple rural old woman, she will understand it very well. Therefore, you should not treat peasants hypocritically. When peasants feel that you are treating him hypocritically, then you have ruined yourself. When a person deliberately simplifies the language and says: Look, the audience in front of me is not highly conscious, then he has already ruined himself by half. On the contrary, when you speak, you know that the audience is no more stupid than yourself, then what you say is understandable to everyone, and it can be seen that you are talking to them as if you are talking to people of equal common sense, culture, and spirit, so that the peasants feel that talking to him is like talking to an equal person. If the peasants feel that there is falsehood in the words, then the peasants will not read such a communication under any circumstances.

	This is what I think is the most important thing. I deliberately repeated it many times but I did it on purpose. In order to emphasize that the most important thing is that the correspondent must be a person who is good at feeling the bad phenomena they want to write about. I myself have found that if you are excited when you are speaking, and if the events you are talking about attract you yourself, then even if you have a lot of audience and you don't speak well, the audience will still listen to you with special attention. And sometimes, you speak like a gramophone, but the audience will sigh, sneeze, etc. If the audience's situation is like this, then the reader will also find falsehood in the communication. The reader is the strictest evaluator, so whoever picks up a pen to write should know: Does he have the desire to write? Second, he should know the object he is writing about. We still don't know whether he has put his feelings into it. This wisdom is beyond our control. If he squeezes out a communication, and if the reader finds it is not true, then he will lose his prestige. …

　　论工农通讯员（续完）

            三、论农村通讯员的任务
    同志们，向农民的通讯员说一些什么，给他们一些什么建议是很困难的，因为我觉得农民的通讯员的工作是特别困难的。问题在于什么人写什么东西。我觉得写跳舞晚会、外交接见、大会，要比写一件普通农村事件或在农村中发生的简单的新现象要容易得多。
    无论是外交接见或是农村事件的描写都是困难的，但是我觉得后者比外交接见还要困难些。这里有一定的形式而且描写的本身也简单些：某人在什么时候说了些什么什么……描写农村的事件要困难得多。应当使它读起来是有趣味的，不是干燥无味的，而是一针见血的。应当使得读过它的人，不只是走马看花地把通讯溜了一下，……而是为它的生动的内容所吸引。
    通讯员自己应当把他要写的东西想透彻。我曾经试着写过（我自己也写过不少的通讯），在你写得简单——没有感情——的地方，写出来就很坏。难哩。只有强迫自己。因此当你写通讯的时候，你就会感觉到，它将是干巴巴的。谁读了它谁就马上会觉得它干巴巴，这是一个特点。里面好像有许多句子，写得也不坏，但是读者仍旧只是溜过去了。为了把它写好，通讯员自己应当为他想写作的欲望所激动，但是当然不是每一回都可以作到这样。因此只有严重地吸引了通讯员的那些事件才能写。
    这是第一。
    我只谈一谈我自己关于写通讯时所遇到的困难的意见。第二，别人会感觉到，乍一看起来……到了农村，马上写出房屋、人物及所有现象，好像是很简单的。而当你一开始时，就会发现这是多么困难。不可能用三言两语把一个人的面貌表达出来。这里需要有丰富的感情。但也需要丰富的知识。作一个通讯员不是那么简单的事情。就这样，拿起来——就像流水似地写出来了。这是办不到的，应当学习很多东西。每一篇通讯，尤其是长篇通讯，必须在里面看得到生活，然而生活是要到人间去看的。因此如果我写森林、树木、家庭用具，如果所有这些都写进去的话，你在这里面放进一个人，而且使他也参加了活动，使他想着，作着，感觉着，充满着感情（我不是说个人的感情，而是共同的感情）。怎样把人物写进通讯里面去，这是一个最难的问题。当我写通讯时，我感觉到，最困难的是把人物写进去。第一要了解他，第二至少要用两三句话来描写他。当我们读普式庚和屠格涅夫的作品的时候，我们觉得这是多么容易呵！拿起来就写出来了。但是当你自己来写的时候，就会发现，用十句话来使读者见到一个活生生的人物，该多么困难。但是当你写起来，如果你不描写他的话，那么他的动作也成为不可能的了。你应当用两三句话这样来写，使读者能捉摸你所写的人物，和这个人在作什么。当你这样作的时候，那么你就会发现，这大概不是件容易的事了。然而写通讯要求作许多事情，受许多训练。这个职业——是最难的职业之一。对任何专家也不要求这样的技巧如同对一个通讯员所要求的一样。我说，照我所感觉的，第一向通讯员要求什么——就是使他善于感受他所写的那些农民的感情。
    例如，如果通讯员要写农民的要求，那么就要使得它——这一要求，吸引住他。如果他写什么事件，他必须对这些事件有亲切的感受。这已经成为未来成绩的一部分。如果它感觉到，他自己亲切地关心这些事件，这也将表现在通讯里面。
    这个问题的第二方面是通讯员应当知道他所写的对象。写不熟悉的事情，是很困难的。既没有语汇，也没有什么可说，——结果是空话连篇。而我们的读者现在要求不写空话，现在应当，如果你写农民的话，你就要知道他是个什么样子。要是你知道他，那么写起来也就容易了。但是最重要的和最主要的是通讯员要通晓国文。我读过的书很多，不比任何一个知识分子读得少，也读过最好的古典著作，我仍旧感到我国文不好，——于是我写起来就感觉到，语汇太少了。……国文好，有很大的作用，所以要求通讯员要很好地懂得国文。……实际上，一个通讯员应当是一个创造者，……应当有智慧，他应当把事情领会透彻，但是只有领会还是不够的，他应当多多学习，因此我想写农村生活决不是说他不要学习。
    我在一开头就指出写城市官场事件是容易的，作这样的事情，完全不必要有特别的学问，但是写农村生活，就必需有特别的学问。我之所谓学问不是指你们应当上大学，你们应当学数学等等。我之所谓学问是指他（通讯员）应当善于批判地对待每一个问题，他能够从各方面分析它，他应当具备一般的常识，而不是说他应当是一位数学专家。有时候即使是数学专家，对别的事物也是正牌的外行。通讯员被要求在各方面都有学问，有知识，能够从一种不大的个别的现象概见一般的现象。例如当你来到乡村里，——在乡村里有许多事件的……那你就应当使你的作品不致于枯燥无味，就应当善于选择，一方面它是带有普遍性的事实，使得所写的事实不是特殊的事实，这样，如果你在叙述它的时候，别的农民读了就知道通讯员在这里所写的是他们那里每天在作的事情。同时这一写作看来应当是通讯员指出了这个生活中的某些新鲜事物。如果你只有从表面上来把生活加以重复的话，那么你所重复的便好像是旧的事物。显然地，人们每天都不会作什么新鲜事情，人们今天吃饭，明天还是吃饭，吃饭的程序每天都是一样的，但是实际上这个程序完全不是一样的。难道你今天吃饭和昨天一样吗？或者是明天——如同今天一样吗？当然，不是的，今天的生活——这不是昨天的生活，否则人就没有变化了，人应当是一样的，我们先是生长，然后衰老以至死亡。人在生活中没有一秒钟是静止的。因此，如果我们写生活，那么在通讯中必须不使人感觉它所指出的是旧的事物。抓住生活——这对于通讯员是最困难的事情。
    应当写在生活中存在着的事情，例如，现在你走上大街并且在大街上看到了生活，就应当抓住这个生活并且把它写到纸上来。于是当你试着把它写到纸上来的时候，却不是生活，而是木头，因为你没有把它在过程中、在运动中表现出来，而好像是把它固定在一个地方上表现出来的，你写的是死体，而不是人的生活。
    这就是通讯员所面对着的最困难的问题。我想，这种智慧——善于描写生活的智慧，——它是在人的天性中存在着的，不是由人创造的，当人们写作什么的时候，结果常常好像是他把生活死化了，好像是它停顿了。因此，当不能抓到生活的时候，通讯便老是乏味的东西，虽然你写得很美。…………
    有时我看到一篇十行的通讯，我想，这个人在写十行的时候，自己激动过，沸腾过，在字里行间也这样感觉到，你读这篇通讯的时候也感到惊奇：“你看，这小伙子是怎样在激动着呵。”这就是通讯员的任务。我个人想，一个通讯员，当他具有神圣的智慧的时候，而且如果具有智慧的通讯员描写农民的事情时，就是在最时髦的、最华丽的客厅里也会读它的，——生活都是吸引人的，无论它是在什么地方。特殊的农民的创造是没有的。某些人说，农民需要有特殊的语言，发甜的、腻腻的。这是瞎说。农民喜欢普通的、好的、正常的国文。而正常的国文要从研究国文得来，因此，所有的通讯员应当好好地研究国文。我可以说，我自己读过很多书。我现在位居国家最高职位，如果有人问我，我缺少什么，我将说，我的国文太不行了，我总是觉得我懂得国文太少了。所以每个通讯员的任务——是研究国文。许多人想，当他研究国文的时候，他将丢掉农民的语言。这是不对的。农民说俄国话也像其他人一样。相反地，谁的国文不太好，谁就不会说农民的话。
    请读一读最优秀的俄国古典著作罢。例如普式庚，好像这位作家是为“上层社会”写作的。或者是——屠格涅夫。请读一读他的《猎人日记》或他的任何一本小说罢。你会发现，他的语言是多么简单，并且多么好懂；你把这样的小说读给纯朴的农村老太婆听，她将很好地懂得它。因此不应当虚伪地对待农民。当农民感到你虚伪地对待他的时候，那么你已经断送自己。当一个人故意地把语言简单化，说：你看，在我面前的听众的觉悟是不高的，那么他就已经把自己断送了一半。相反地，当你讲话的时候，你知道听众并不比自己更笨一些，那么所讲的对任何人都全是好懂的，并且可以看出，你同他们谈话是与常识、文化、精神相等的人在说话一样，以致使农民感觉到与他谈话如同与一个同等的人谈话一样。如果农民一感觉到话中有假，那么这样的通讯在任何情况下农民也不会读它。
    这就是我所认为最主要的事情。我故意地重复了许多次但是我是故意这样作的。以便着重说明最主要的在于通讯员必须是一个善于感受他们要写的那些不良现象的人。我自己发现，如果你在说话的时候，自己也激动了，而且如果你所讲的事件也吸引了你自己的话，那么即使你的听众很多，而你又讲得不好，但是听众仍旧会特别注意地来听你。而有时候，你讲话像一部留声机一样，但是听众会唉声叹气、打喷嚏等等。如果听众的情况是这样的话，那么读者在通讯中也将会发现虚伪。读者是最严格的评价者，因此谁拿起笔来写作，就应当知道：他有没有写作的愿望？第二，他应当知道他所写的对象。我们还不知道，他把感情放进去了没有。这种智慧是在我们依赖以外的。如果他硬挤出一篇通讯来，而且如果读者发现它是不确实的话，那么他将失去自己的威信。……
