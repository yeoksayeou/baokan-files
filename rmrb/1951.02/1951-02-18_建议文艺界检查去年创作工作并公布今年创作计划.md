    Suggest the Literary and Art Circles Examine Last Year's Creative Work and Announce This Year's Creative Plans
    To the Editor:
    In early 1950, publications such as "People's Literature" and "Northeast Literature and Art" published creative plans for 1950 from literary and art workers in various regions, collected by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, respectively. According to the plan, readers across the country would see at least hundreds of thousands of words of new works. This is valuable and is something readers eagerly anticipate.
    When I saw in the 1950 production communique that several production departments had exceeded their planned tasks, I thought that the literary and art circles should also make a timely summary. I suggest that relevant departments (such as the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles) should examine the creative plans of writers that have been collected: how much has been completed, how much has been exceeded, what is the quality, and publish the results publicly. This will not only urge literary and art workers forward but also attract more people to pay attention to literary and artistic creation activities.
    In addition, I hope to see the creative plans of literary and art workers for this year. I hope relevant units will undertake this work and publish it in books and periodicals.

### 建议文艺界检查去年创作工作并公布今年创作计划

专栏：读者来信

    建议文艺界检查去年创作工作并公布今年创作计划编辑同志：
    一九五○年年初，《人民文学》、《东北文艺》等刊物曾分别发表由全国文联及东北文联等所征集的各地文艺工作者一九五○年创作计划。按照计划估计，全国读者将会见到至少几十万字的新作品。这是可宝贵的，也是被读者们寄予热烈的期望的。
    当我看到一九五○年生产公报上，若干生产部门超过任务完成计划的时候，就想到文艺界也应该作一个及时的总结。我建议有关部门（如全国文联）应就所曾征集的作家创作计划进行检查：完成多少，超额多少，质量如何，并予以公开发表。这样，不但可以督促文艺工作者，并且可以吸引更多的人关心文艺创作活动。
    另外，我希望看到本年度文艺工作者们的创作计划。希望有关单位从事这一工作，并在书刊上发表。
                                                   阿丛
