　　Several Problems in the Establishment of Propaganda Networks by the District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in the Five Districts of Beijing
    中共北京五区区委会
    When the work of establishing propaganda networks was first started, some Party members and Youth League members in the five districts of Beijing showed a poor understanding of the Central Committee's decision to establish propaganda networks. For example, they said: Since all Party members are doing propaganda work, why is it necessary to establish propagandists? Wasn't it good to do propaganda work according to each system before?! Establishing a propaganda network is good, but what if it affects work and study? Due to insufficient understanding, some problems occurred in some branches during the establishment of the propaganda network.

    In the selection of propagandists, some Party branches understood that propagandists "should have the necessary political awareness" to mean that they should have a very high level of political awareness. Therefore, they believed that none of the Party members in their branch were qualified to be propagandists. However, other branches selected 14-year-old junior high school students or people who did not have good connections with the masses as propagandists. Some branch committee members and administrative leaders were unwilling to be propagandists, emphasizing that they were busy with work and it was best not to have additional responsibilities. In response to the above situation, the district committee pointed out to the branches: The work of establishing propaganda networks should be carried out cautiously, and a solid foundation should be laid, but do not "close the door"; the Central Committee's decision should be carefully studied and accurately understood. At the same time, it was also pointed out that the work of propagandists is not contradictory to their own administrative work, but consistent. The reason why propaganda work affected their own work in the past was because propaganda work was not carried out regularly, and sometimes it was done in a rush, which affected some regular work. This phenomenon shows that propaganda work in the past was far from sufficient. If every Party member regards propaganda as their bounden duty and carries out propaganda in conjunction with their own work, it will not only not affect their own work, but will also be conducive to the completion of their own work tasks. Thanks to the timely guidance of the district committee, the branches that are establishing propaganda networks are very careful in reviewing propagandists, so the approval is also very smooth.

    The methods of reviewing propagandists in each branch are: discussion and approval by the branch committee; the branch committee proposes a list, and the branch general meeting approves it; a joint meeting of the branch committee and group leaders approves it; or the Party branch committee or Youth League branch committee proposes a list, which is then discussed and approved by the Party branch committee. The Fifth District Committee believes that the last method is better among these methods. But no matter which method is adopted, the branch committee must adopt a serious and responsible attitude to review and approve it before submitting it to the district committee for approval.

    Initially, after the propagandists of each branch were approved by the district committee, some branches promptly announced the list of propagandists to the masses, while others delayed it for a long time before announcing it; some school branches emphasized that it was winter vacation and they would announce it when school started. When each branch announced the list of propagandists, some carefully explained the significance and role of the propagandists in conjunction with the announcement of the list, which made both the propagandists and the masses pay attention to this work. However, some school branches simply posted a list of propagandists, without explaining anything to the masses, so many students did not understand what the propagandists were doing; some thought that organizing propagandists during the winter vacation was to carry out propaganda to the citizens; the propagandists themselves did not know whether the propagandists were long-term or short-term. In fact, after the propagandists are approved, the list should be announced to the masses as soon as possible and explained clearly. Because announcing the list of propagandists as early as possible is to enable the propagandists to accept the supervision of the masses from the beginning of their work, and to promote the propagandists to carry out work among the masses better; at the same time, it enables the masses to know where the Party's propagandists are, and where to go if they have questions, so as to better strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses. Therefore, the announcement of the list of propagandists should be regarded as a test for the branch committee to select propagandists and for the propagandists themselves, and also as a lesson for the masses. In this way, the announcement of the list of propagandists should not be sloppy, but should be done solemnly, like the method adopted by the Fifth District Federation of Trade Unions Office: Before announcing the list of propagandists, the Party小组 had a special discussion on the issue of establishing propagandists and announcing the list, so that everyone had a correct understanding of this. After that, the list of propagandists was announced in the name of the branch at the meeting of all cadres; at the same time, the administrative leader explained to everyone the meaning of establishing propagandists and announcing the list, the tasks of the propagandists, and what attitude everyone should have towards the propagandists. This approach is very necessary. The Fifth District Committee also promptly spread this experience to the branches. Recently, some branches have been very cautious in announcing the list of propagandists, and the masses have responded very well.

    After the propagandists are approved, the branch should immediately formulate a work plan for the propagandists and various necessary systems according to the plan of the higher authorities, but the plans of some branches are too generalized. Each branch should formulate practical plans according to its own specific situation, and adhere to the meeting, reporting, learning, and inspection systems to ensure that the work plan is completed on schedule.

　　中共北京市五区区委建立宣传网工作中的几个问题
    中共北京五区区委会
    在开始进行建立宣传网工作时，北京市五区有的党员与团员，表现出对中央建立宣传网的决定的认识还很差，如说：既然党员都作宣传工作，为什么还要建立宣传员呢？以前按各系统作宣传工作，不是也很好吗？！建立宣传网很好，但影响了工作和学习怎样办？由于认识不足，因此在建立宣传网过程中有的支部发生了一些问题。
    在挑选宣传员中，有一部分党支部把宣传员“应当具有必要的政治觉悟”，了解成要政治觉悟很高，因此认为自己支部的党员，都没有作宣传员的资格。但是另有些支部却把十四岁的初中学生或与群众联系不好的人也挑选为宣传员。还有的支部委员与行政负责同志不愿作宣传员，强调工作忙，最好不兼职。根据以上情况，区委向各支部指出：建立宣传网的工作要慎重进行，基础要打好，但也不要“关门”；对中央的决定应认真学习，妥确的了解。同时又指出：宣传员工作与本身行政工作并不矛盾，而是一致的。过去所以宣传工作影响了本身工作，是因为宣传工作进行得不经常，有时突击一下以致影响了一些经常工作，这种现象，正说明过去宣传工作作得十分不够，如果每个党员都把宣传当作自己的天职，结合自己工作进行宣传，不但不会影响本身工作，并有利于自己工作任务的完成。由于区委指导的及时，正在建立宣传网的支部，对审查宣传员作得都很慎重，因此批准时也很顺利。
    各支部审查宣传员的方式有：支委会讨论通过的；支委会提出名单，支部大会通过的；支委与小组长联席会通过的；还有党支委或团支委提出名单，再经党支委会讨论通过。五区区委认为在这几种方式中，最后一种好些。但无论采用那一种方式，支委会必须采取认真负责的态度审查通过，再交区委批准。
    起初，各支部的宣传员经区委批准后，有的支部及时向群众公布了宣传员的名单，有的支部就拖延了好久，才向群众公布；有的学校支部强调放寒假了，开学再公布。在各支部公布宣传员名单时，有的配合公布名单，慎重的说明了宣传员的意义与作用，结果使宣传员与群众都很重视这一工作。但有的学校支部只是简单的贴一张宣传员名单就算公布了，没有向群众进行交待，结果很多同学不了解宣传员是作什么的；有的认为放寒假了，组织宣传员是向市民进行宣传的；宣传员本身也不知道宣传员是长期的还是短期的。事实上，宣传员被批准后，应该早向群众公布，交待清楚。因为及早公布宣传员名单，是使宣传员一开始工作就能够接受群众的监督，促使宣传员更好的在群众中进行工作；同时使群众知道党的宣传员所在，有问题有地方去问，更好的加强党与群众的联系。因此应把公布宣传员名单认为是对支部委员会挑选宣传员及宣传员本人的一次考验，也是给群众上一次课。这样公布宣传员名单就不得草率，应郑重其事，像五区工会办事处采取的办法就好：公布宣传员名单前，党小组曾把建立宣传员与公布名单问题专门进行了讨论，使大家对此有了正确的认识。此后即在全体干部会上，以支部名义公布宣传员名单；同时行政负责同志向大家说明建立宣传员与公布名单的义意、宣传员的任务、大家对宣传员应抱什么态度。这种作法是十分必要的。五区区委也及时向各支部传播了这一经验。近来有的支部公布宣传员名单就很慎重，群众反映很好。
    宣传员批准后，支部应根据上级计划，马上订出宣传员工作计划及各种必要制度，但有些支部的计划却流于一般化。各支部应根据自己具体情况订出切实的计划，并要坚持执行会议、汇报、学习、检查等制度，以保证工作计划按期完成。
