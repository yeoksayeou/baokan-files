On February 23rd, the cadres of the Changxindian Railway Factory Trade Union announced the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" to the workers. The workers were all delighted upon hearing this. Because they had suffered persecution from traitorous special agents, they knew how deep was the pain inflicted upon the people.

During the period of Japanese寇 and Kuomintang rule, there was a heinous traitor and special agent in Changxindian named Wang Yujie, nicknamed "Living Yama," and the people called him "Lord Wang" to his face. In July 1942, Wang became a police officer in the Japanese寇 police section, specializing in monitoring, informing, arresting, and persecuting workers. Twelve workers, including Tan Fu, Li Yonggui, Zhai Xiangyun, and Ma Yongfu, were brutally murdered by Wang匪; two civilians were personally buried alive by Wang匪 on the northwest slope of the Longche workshop and devoured by dogs; more than 500 workers were detained and transferred to Japan for forced labor by Wang匪 and other traitorous special agents, many of whom died of illness or were buried at sea. Li Wenyu, a worker at the Changxindian Railway Factory, was one of those who suffered from Wang匪's poison.

In the winter of 1944, under the extremely cruel exploitation of the Japanese寇, the workers of the railway factory were all emaciated from hunger. Li Wenyu left the factory and made a living by running errands between Beiping and Shijiazhuang. Although he worked hard and didn't earn much money, he still had to give some to the Japanese寇's lackeys—the special agents of the police section. Once, Li Wenyu refused to give money to the police section and fought with a special agent. On the fourth day after this incident, at three o'clock in the afternoon, Li Wenyu was sleeping at home when Wang Yujie and a Japanese special agent and a Chinese special agent walked in, pointed a gun at Li Wenyu, and asked him to go to the police section. Li Wenyu was baffled and didn't know what crime he had committed; but he had no choice but to follow them. As soon as he went out, Wang匪 ordered someone to handcuff him. When he arrived at the police section, Wang匪 insisted that Li Wenyu had stolen something from the factory and demanded that he confess truthfully. Li Wenyu said, "God knows! What have I stolen? What do I have to confess?" Wang匪 angrily ordered someone to strip him naked and beat him severely with belts and wooden sticks. At that time, it was common to hear about the Japanese寇 and traitorous special agents persecuting Chinese people. Once arrested, after being severely beaten, they were either buried alive or fed to foreign dogs. Li Wenyu hardened his heart and thought, "I'm going to risk my life anyway!" The special agents beat him until his skin was torn and his flesh was bruised, but he still didn't say a word. Li Wenyu's feet were then tied to a sloping bench, his hands were tied behind his back, Wang匪 sat on his stomach, the Japanese special agent grabbed his hair and pressed his head down forcefully, and a wet towel was placed over his mouth and nostrils, and someone poured cold water directly onto the towel with a rubber tube. The cold water permeated through the towel and quickly penetrated into the respiratory system and oral cavity. Within a few minutes, Li Wenyu became drowsy and passed out. When he woke up, countless small icicles were结着 on his hair. The methods of the Japanese寇 and traitorous special agents were so vicious!

Li Wenyu stayed in the police section for a total of five days, was severely beaten three times, and had cold water poured on him five times, each time passing out. Later, the Japanese寇 sent Li Wenyu to a concentration camp in Shijiazhuang. Although it was already the harsh winter, he was still wearing only a single layer of clothing and was barefoot. He didn't get enough to eat every day and had to run several times, and at night he slept head to head with his fellow sufferers on the ground. Later, he was transferred to the Tanggu concentration camp and then went to Japan to work as a coal miner, until he returned after Japan surrendered.

Li Wenyu returned to his motherland with a belly full of resentment, thinking that the War of Resistance had been won and he could finally take revenge; but who would have thought that Wang Yujie had transformed himself into a Kuomintang special agent, and the workers were still being oppressed. Li Wenyu had no choice but to endure in silence.

Even more tragic than Li Wenyu's experience was that of Ma Yongfu, the son of old worker Ma Xiang, who was killed by Wang匪. One New Year's five years ago, Ma Yongfu owed someone a few dollars because of gambling and couldn't repay them, so he was reported to the police section. Wang Yujie thought this was a good opportunity to make a fortune, so he used the tactic of "the thief crying 'stop thief!'" to accuse Ma Yongfu of being a "special agent," arrested him, and demanded that Ma Xiang pay money to redeem his son. At that time, the workers' lives were very hard, and they couldn't even get enough to eat, let alone come up with money; at the same time, Ma Xiang thought: it's just gambling for the New Year, it's not a violation of any "law," and he'll be out in a few days. He didn't pay too much attention to it. Who knew that Ma Yongfu was subjected to torture by the bandits and then taken to Yongle to be shot. Ma Xiang ran to Yongle crying, but didn't even see his son's body. They only had this one son, and his mother was driven mad for several months, and from then on suffered from an incurable disease. Ma Xiang's family of eight relied on the two of them, father and son, to earn a living. Since Ma Yongfu's death, the family's income had decreased, and the family's life became even more unsustainable. The couple had no choice but to send their three underage daughters to others as child brides with tears in their eyes, and Ma Yongfu's wife also remarried with her granddaughter. The family was scattered from then on.

After the liberation of Beijing, Li Wenyu was elected by everyone as a member of the factory's trade union, and often met with cadres, and often heard them say that they would seek welfare for the workers. Li Wenyu was very happy in his heart, thinking that the opportunity for revenge had arrived, so he told the factory leaders about himself and other workers being devastated by Wang匪. Because many people had reported Wang Yujie, the Military Control Commission of the Beijing Municipal Military Control Committee accepted everyone's request, and after detailed investigation, sentenced Wang匪 to death according to law. The execution site was also chosen near the Changxindian Railway Factory according to the workers' request. Many people went to see it that day, and Li Wenyu, Ma Xiang, and his wife all went to see it in person. Old man Ma Xiang said afterwards: "Thanks to the People's Government for making the decision for us, this long-standing grievance of mine has finally been vented; my mood that day was even more refreshing than eating an ice cream stick on a hot day!"

Li Wenyu was also very happy that day. He once said to people that since Wang匪 was executed, he had a deeper understanding of the Communist Party and the People's Government. He made a request to the Party organization, and after approval, gloriously joined the Communist Party. He felt that the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government were reasonable and justified, and should have been done long ago. As long as these regulations are implemented well, the people will live and work in peace and contentment.

　　向汉奸特务王玉杰讨还了血债
    林洪
    二月二十三日，长辛店铁路工厂工会的干部向工人们宣读了中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，工人们听了，个个喜形于色。因为他们曾经遭受过汉奸特务的迫害，知道他们所加于人民的痛苦是多么深重。
    在日寇和国民党统治时期，长辛店有一个罪大恶极的汉奸特务王玉杰，外号“活阎王”，老百姓见面都称他“王爷”。一九四二年七月，王匪充当了日寇警务段的警务手，专门监视、告密、逮捕和残害工人。先后被王匪惨杀的工友有谭福、李永贵、翟香云、马永福等十二人；两个市民被王匪亲手活埋于龙车房西北坡，被狗吞食；五百多工人被王匪和其他汉奸特务扣押转送日本服苦役，其中病死及葬身鱼腹者甚多。长辛店铁路工厂工人李文友，就是曾经遭受王匪毒害的一个人。
    一九四四年冬天，在日寇极为残酷的压榨下，铁路工厂的工友们一个个饿得面黄肌瘦。李文友脱离了工厂，专靠在北平和石家庄之间跑买卖为生。虽然辛辛苦苦地赚不了多少钱，但还要拿出一部分来给日寇的狗腿子——警务段的特务们。有一次，李文友因不愿送钱给警务段，和一个特务打了架。这件事发生后的第四天下午三点钟，李文友正在家里睡觉，突然，王玉杰和一个日本特务、一个中国特务走进来，用枪指着李文友，要他到警务段去一趟。李文友莫明其妙，不知道自己犯了什么罪；但也没有办法，只好跟着他们去了。刚一出门，王匪就叫人把手铐给他带上。到了警务段，王匪硬说李文友偷了工厂的东西，要他从实招来。李文友说：“天知道！我偷了什么东西？我有什么可招的？”王匪怒气冲冲地叫人把他的衣服剥光，皮带，木棍，一顿乱打。那时，日寇和汉奸特务残害中国人的事时有所闻，只要一被捉去，遭毒打后，不是活埋，就是喂洋狗。李文友把心一横，心里想：“反正老子把这条命拚出去了！”特务们把他打得皮开肉烂，他仍然没有说出一句话。李文友的双脚又被缚在一条斜面的板凳上，双手被反缚着，王匪坐在他的肚子上，日本特务用力抓着他的头发，死命地捺着头，嘴和鼻孔上放了一条湿毛巾，有人拿着橡皮管子直往毛巾上灌凉水。凉水透过毛巾，很快就渗透到呼吸系统和口腔里，没有几分钟，李文友就昏昏沉沉地死过去了。当他苏醒过来的时候，头发上结着无数条小小的冰棍。日寇和汉奸特务的手段就是这么毒辣！
    李文友一共在警务段住了五天，挨过三次毒打，被灌过五次凉水，每次都昏死过去。后来，日寇把李文友送到石家庄集中营，虽然已是严寒的冬天，身上仍穿着一件单衣，赤着脚。每天吃不饱，还要跑步好几次，晚上和难友们头对头地挤着睡在地下。以后他又被转送到塘沽集中营，然后到日本去作挖煤的苦役，直到日本投降后才回来。
    李文友带着满腹的愤恨回到祖国，心想抗战胜利了，这一下可以报仇了；但那里想得到，王玉杰摇身一变，又成了国民党的特务，工人仍然受着压迫。李文友只好忍气吞声地过下去。
    比李文友的遭遇更为悲惨的，还有老工友马祥的儿子马永福，他是被王匪活活害死的。五年前的一个新年，马永福因为赌博欠了别人几个钱，无法偿还，被人告到警务段。王玉杰认为这是大发横财的好机会，就用“贼喊捉贼”的手法，给马永福按上“特务”的罪名，把他捉去了，要马祥拿钱去赎儿子。那时工人的生活很苦，连饭都吃不饱，那里还拿得出钱来；同时马祥心里想：过新年要耍钱，又没犯什么“王法”，过几天就会出来的。他没有太注意这件事。那知道马永福被匪徒施以酷刑后，就弄到永乐去枪毙了。马祥哭哭啼啼地跑到永乐去，连儿子的尸首都没有看见。他们夫妻两人就只有这一个儿子，他母亲气得发了几个月疯，而且从此得下了不治之病。马祥全家共八口人，就指望着父子两人挣钱过活。自从马永福死后，家里减少了收入，全家生活更是无法维持。夫妻两人只好含着眼泪把三个未成年的女儿送给别人作童养媳，马永福的妻子也带着孙女改嫁别人。一家人从此东离西散。
    北京解放后，李文友被大家选为厂里的工会委员，时常和干部见面，常听见他们说要为工人谋福利。李文友心里很高兴，心想这下报仇的机会到了，就把自己和其他工友受王匪摧残的事向厂里的负责人讲了。因为告发王玉杰的人很多，北京市军事管制委员会军法处接受大家的请求，经详细调查后，依法将王匪判处死刑。执刑的地点，也根据工人们的要求，选择在长辛店铁路工厂的附近。那一天去看的人很多，李文友、马祥和老伴都亲自跑去看。马祥老汉后来说：“多亏人民政府替我们作主，我多年来的这口怨气才吐出来；我那天的心情真比大热天吃了一根冰棍还要痛快！”
    那天李文友也很高兴，他曾经对人说，从王匪被处决以后，他对共产党和人民政府有了更深刻的认识。他向党的组织提出请求，经过批准，光荣地加入了共产党。他觉得中央人民政府颁布的惩治反革命条例，合情合理，而且早就应该这样作。只要这个条例执行得好，人民就安居乐业了。
