Stalin's talk with a Pravda correspondent on the 16th of this month provided a thorough exposure of the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressor bloc manipulating the United Nations, and made a significant appeal to peace-loving humanity. This talk warmly supported the great and just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, and pointed out to the world the imperialists' new war plans and the path to preventing a new war.

The imperialist bloc, headed by the United States, is now continuing its aggression against Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, actively preparing for new wars, and actively engaging in conspiracies to rearm Japan and West Germany, while also slandering and vilifying the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It is clear that American and British imperialism is turning black into white, deceiving the people, and attempting to drag them into war. Stalin's talk first thoroughly exposed the tricks of the American and British aggressor forces in deceiving the people.

The method used by the American and British aggressor forces to deceive the people now is to portray their war policy as a "peace policy," their aggression as "defense," and the Soviet Union's genuine peace policy as a "war policy," and to depict the sacred self-defense actions of the Chinese and Korean people as "aggression." As Stalin said, this is an unconscionable act. Anyone who has not lost all conscience cannot say that China is engaging in aggression and the Soviet Union is preparing for war.

Why must the imperialist aggressor bloc so unscrupulously turn black into white? As Stalin put it well, "They need war in order to obtain super-profits, in order to plunder other countries. These are the wealthy men whose property is counted in millions and billions; they regard war as a profitable business that produces huge profits." Not only are the aggressive forces in the United States, Britain, and France like this, but landlords and merchants in twenty Latin American countries also hope day and night for the outbreak of war in Asia and Europe in order to sell goods to the belligerent countries at extremely high prices. Therefore, this small group of war-mongers is actually a group of blood-drinking beasts. In order to carry out aggression, this group of beasts cannot but deceive the masses and cannot but turn black into white.

American imperialism controls the United Nations, manipulates the majority within it, and since June 1950, has used the United Nations, originally intended to maintain peace, to cover up the heinous armed aggression launched by American imperialism against Korea and China. Since that time, the "United Nations" has openly embarked on the road to war. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries have striven to restore the United Nations' own standing by peacefully resolving the Korean issue and admitting the People's Republic of China into the United Nations organization. However, the imperialist aggressor bloc not only refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue but even forced the United Nations to pass the absurd American proposal falsely accusing our country of "aggression." This has made the United Nations "increasingly a tool of war, a tool for launching another world war," becoming "an American organization that caters to the needs of American aggressors," and "no longer a worldwide organization of equal rights for all countries." Thus, the United Nations has forfeited its moral authority, and its end can only be a tragic disintegration.

Do the American, British, and French aggressive forces and their servants really have free rein to do whatever they want by being so unscrupulous and reckless?

No! Stalin called on peace-loving people all over the world to unite and rise up to defeat the vicious plans of the imperialist bloc, and determined the future of the imperialist aggressors' defeat from the struggle in Korea.

Regarding the war in Korea, he affirmed that if the United States and Britain do not accept the peaceful proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, then they are bound to fail. He pointed out that the key issue is their low morale. Morale is the primary factor in the victory or defeat of war, and an army without morale cannot win in war. This point is now already known by many American and British officers and soldiers on the Korean battlefield, as well as many commentators in the United States and Britain.

Obviously, it is unnecessary to prove that if the imperialist bloc still cannot learn a lesson from this and dares to launch a new world war, then the laws of the Korean battlefield today will inevitably become the laws of a new world war. This means that imperialism is bound to find its own grave in the new war it provokes.

Mad challengers can provoke war, but here, the challengers are not the stronger forces, but merely a group of mad gamblers. The people of the world desire peace. The world peace and democracy camp, which is stronger than the imperialist bloc, is working to prevent new wars and also has the possibility of preventing new wars. The key here is the struggle of the people of all countries against the bloody plans and deceptive propaganda of the war-mongers. As long as the people of all countries uphold peace, the war-mongers will lose the gambling tools they can temporarily use. Therefore, Stalin correctly pointed out: "Precisely for this reason, the broad movement for the maintenance of peace, as a means of exposing the criminal machinations of the war-mongers, is now of paramount significance."

The Chinese people fully recognize the importance of Stalin's call. The Chinese people are now standing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people, the Korean people, and the people of all people's democratic countries on the forefront of the struggle for world peace. The heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, and the enthusiastic Resist America, Aid Korea movement throughout China, are the Chinese people's great contribution to world peace. We should intensify our support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, intensify the Resist America, Aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace struggle throughout China, and intensify cooperation with the peace movements of the people of Asian countries and the people of all countries in the world. We should build our great motherland into a great fortress that will forever be victorious against imperialist aggression.

### 斯大林的谈话指出了制止新战争的道路

　　斯大林的谈话指出了制止新战争的道路
    斯大林在本月十六日对真理报记者的谈话，对于操纵着联合国的帝国主义侵略集团的阴谋作了极透彻的揭露，对于爱好和平的人类作了重大的号召。这一个谈话，热烈地援助了中国人民和朝鲜人民的伟大正义斗争，并且向全世界指出了帝国主义的新战争计划和制止新战争的道路。
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团，现在正在继续侵略朝鲜和中国领土台湾，正在积极准备新的战争，积极进行重新武装日本和西德的阴谋，并为此而肆行诽谤和诬蔑中华人民共和国和苏联。很显然，美英帝国主义正在颠倒黑白，欺骗人民，企图把人民拖入战争。斯大林的谈话首先彻底地揭露了美英侵略势力欺骗人民的诡计。
    美英侵略势力现在欺骗人民的方法是：把它们的战争政策说成了“和平政策”，把它们的侵略政策说成了“防御”，而把苏联的真正的和平政策说成“战争政策”，中国人民和朝鲜人民神圣的自卫行动说成了“侵略”。诚如斯大林所说，这是一种丧尽天良的行为。任何没有丧尽天良的人，都不能说中国在实行侵略，苏联在准备战争。
    为什么帝国主义侵略集团一定要丧尽天良地颠倒黑白呢？斯大林说得好，“他们需要战争以便获得超额利润，以便劫掠其他国家。这些人就是那些财产以百万和亿万计的豪富们，他们认为战争是产生巨大利润的有利可图的事情。”不仅在美国、英国及法国的侵略势力是如此，拉丁美洲二十个国家内的地主商人们也成天盼望着亚洲和欧洲爆发战争，以便以极高的价格，向交战各国出售货物。因此，这一小群战争贩子，实际上是一群喝人血的野兽。这群野兽为了肆行侵略，就不能不欺骗人民群众，就不能不颠倒黑白。
    美帝国主义控制着联合国，操纵着联合国里面的多数，从一九五○年六月起，就用原以保持和平为目的的联合国，来掩护美帝国主义对朝鲜和中国所发起的穷凶极恶的武装侵略。从那个时候起，“联合国”已经公然走上战争的道路。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家曾经力图使联合国用和平解决朝鲜问题和吸收中华人民共和国参加联合国组织的方法，来挽回它自己的地位。但是帝国主义侵略集团不但拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，而且竟然强迫联合国通过美国反诬我国“侵略”的荒谬提案。这样，就使联合国“日益变成战争的工具，发动另一次世界战争的工具”，成为“迎合美国侵略者需要的美国组织”，而“不再是各国权利平等的世界性组织了”。这样，联合国就断送了它的道义的权威，而其结局只能是悲惨的分崩离析了。
    美、英、法侵略势力及其仆从们这样丧尽天良，胡作非为，是不是它们真的可以为所欲为呢？
    不是的！斯大林号召全世界爱好和平的人民一致奋起来战胜帝国主义集团的凶恶计划，并且从朝鲜的斗争中断定了帝国主义侵略者的失败前途。
    对朝鲜的战争，他肯定地说，如果美国和英国不接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的和平建议，那么，它们就必然要失败。他指出关键问题在于它们的士气不高。士气是战争胜败的第一个因素，没有士气的军队，是不能在战争中取得胜利的。这一点，在朝鲜战场上的许多美英官兵以及美英国内的许多评论家现在也已经知道了。
    显然用不着证明：如果帝国主义集团仍然不能由此得到教训，敢于发动新的世界战争，那么，今天朝鲜战场上的规律，就必然成为新的世界战争中的规律。这就是说，帝国主义必然在它自己所挑起的新的战争中找到自己的坟墓。
    疯狂的挑战者可以挑起战争，但是在这里，挑战的人们并不是力量较强的人们，而只是一群发了疯的赌徒。全世界人民是愿意和平的。力量大于帝国主义集团的世界和平民主阵营，正在努力制止新的战争，也有可能制止新的战争。这里的关键，是世界各国人民反对战争贩子血腥计划和欺骗宣传的奋斗。只要世界各国人民坚持和平，战争贩子们就失去了他们所能暂时利用的赌具。所以斯大林正确地指出：“就是因为这个缘故，广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”
    中国人民充分认识斯大林号召的重要性。中国人民现在正在和苏联人民、和朝鲜人民、和各人民民主国家人民并肩站在为世界和平而奋斗的最前线。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线的英勇作战，全中国人民的热烈的抗美援朝运动，是中国人民对于世界和平的伟大贡献。我们应当加紧支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，加紧在全中国展开抗美援朝、反对武装日本和保卫世界和平的斗争，加紧对亚洲各国人民和世界各国人民保卫和平运动的合作。我们应当把我们的伟大祖国，造成为反对帝国主义侵略的永远胜利的伟大堡垒。
