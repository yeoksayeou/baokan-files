Response to Criticism from the People's Daily

　　Datong Municipal People's Government Mining and Labor Bureaus
　　Self-Criticism Regarding the Unreasonable System at the Wajinwan Coal Mine
　　Our bureau's Wajinwan Mine still retains old and unreasonable systems, which we failed to correct in time. Comrade Zhang Dahe brought this to our attention, enabling us to make improvements. This is something we greatly welcome. After reading Comrade Zhang's opinions published in the People's Daily on December 5th, we immediately sent our bureau's engineer, Comrade An Maohua, to the mine for a thorough investigation. We now present the results of the investigation and offer a profound self-criticism as follows:
    (1) The mine does indeed use the old scale to measure coal. Their reason is that the workers are accustomed to the old scale and are not very familiar with the new scale. Therefore, due to following old habits, they did not correct it in time. Although this is said to be taking care of the workers' convenience, it is ultimately not as reasonable as using the new scale to measure coal. Although workers may not be accustomed to it at first, if detailed explanations and persuasion are given, they will naturally understand. The main problem is that there was no intention to reform in thinking, but merely perfunctory compliance.
    As for selling coal, it is the task of the supply bureau and is also based on converting 1680 jin (old scale) into one ton. However, according to our understanding, the supply bureau sells coal in tons as the unit of calculation. If it is sold retail, it is of course also converted from jin to tons.
    (2) The method of estimating weight is not to use a scale, but to rely entirely on the coal receiver's eyes. The standard is calculated by "zao," with each "zao" being 120 jin of the old scale, and each "zao" is further divided into ten "li," with one "li" being 12 jin of the old scale. Carrying 120 jin of coal on one's back is counted as one "zao." If 130 jin is carried, it is rounded up to one "zao" and one "li." Conversely, if only 129 jin is carried, it is only counted as one "zao." Although most workers are happy to continue using this method of estimation to avoid the time and effort of weighing, the coal receiver's eyes are ultimately not as accurate as a scale, and there are often instances of overestimation and underestimation. Individual cases of acting on personal feelings without principle must be corrected. The mine has been ordered to implement weighing from January 1, 1951 (a weighing scale has already been prepared), with accurate weighing, and when summarizing the number of jin carried by each person each time at the end of the shift, any fractions should be rounded to the nearest whole number to ensure fairness.
    (3) In the past, the employees who estimated weight did indeed have some undesirable work styles, which caused dissatisfaction among some workers. This was mainly due to the lack of supervision by the mine's leadership on a daily basis. The mine has now been instructed to conduct strict education for employees with undesirable work styles and to order that all coal be weighed to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
    (4) Since coal areas vary in distance, wages should naturally differ. However, the mine does not differentiate between distance, and wages are still paid the same. Although it is said that workers take turns to exchange coal-carrying areas tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to make adjustments, the number of people on duty each day varies, which is ultimately unreasonable. The mine has been instructed to calculate and pay wages separately according to the distance of the coal areas and to designate which worker carries coal from which area to ensure fairness. However, due to special circumstances, the labor brigade still adopts the method of rotating and exchanging coal areas for adjustment.
    Based on the above self-criticism, in general, our bureau has not paid enough attention to the management of small kilns in the past and has not taken adequate care. When we took over the coal kilns from the enemy, we also took over some old habits, which we failed to correct in time. In the future, we will strengthen the management of small kilns, gradually improve them, and hope that Comrade Zhang Dahe and other workers will offer more opinions, which we will sincerely accept and use as a basis for correction.

### 大同市人民政府矿务、劳动两局  关于挖金湾煤矿存在不合理制度的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　大同市人民政府矿务、劳动两局      
    关于挖金湾煤矿存在不合理制度的检讨
    本局挖金湾矿尚残留旧有不合理的制度，我们没有及时纠正，承张大合同志给我们提出来，使我们有所改进。这是我们极端欢迎的。我们自读到十二月五日人民日报刊载张同志所提的意见后，当即派本局工程师安茂华同志到挖矿作彻底的调查，兹特将调查所得的结果，作深刻的检讨如下：
    （一）该矿确实是用老秤收煤，他们的理由是工人习惯于用老秤，对于新秤不甚了解，所以因沿旧习，致未及时改正。这虽说是照顾了工人的便利，但究不如以新秤收煤合理。工人一时虽有些不习惯，如果经过详细解释与说服，自然可以明了，主要是在思想上没有打算改革，而只是因循敷衍。
    至于卖煤，是供应局的任务，也是以一六八○斤（老秤）折合一吨，不过据我们了解，供应局卖煤是以吨为计算单位的，如果零卖当然亦以斤折合为吨。
    （二）估秤办法，是不用秤，全凭收煤员眼睛看，其标准是以遭计算，每遭为一二○斤老秤，每遭又为十厘，一厘为老秤十二斤，背一二○斤老秤的煤即算一遭，若背到一三○斤即上进为一遭一厘，反之若只背一二九斤的，也就只算为一遭了。这种估秤的办法，虽有多数工人为避免过秤费时费事乐于沿用，但是收煤员的眼睛究竟不如秤准，常有估高估低之弊。个别人无原则地动私人感情，亟应纠正。已令该矿自一九五一年一月一日起，实行过秤过磅（现已备磅秤一台）有一得一，收班总结每人每次所背斤数时，如有零尾按四舍五入计算，以期合理。
    （三）估秤的职工，以往确实有些不良的作风，引起一些工人不满，主要是该矿领导方面平日失察所致，现已饬该矿对于作风不良的职工，进行严格教育，并令一律过秤，以防将来再有类似事件发生。
    （四）煤区既有远近不同，工资自应互异，但是该矿不分远近，工资仍然一样发，虽说是今明日轮流互换背煤区域，借资调剂，但每日到班的人数不同，究属不合理。已由该矿按煤区远近分别计发工资，并划定某工人背某区的煤，以昭公允，但劳动大队因情况特殊，仍采用轮流互换煤区办法调剂。
    根据以上检讨，总的说来，我局对小窰的管理以往未加重视，照顾不周，从敌人的手里把煤窑接收过来时，同时也把旧的习惯接来了一些，未能及时纠正。今后我们要加强小窰管理，逐步改善，并望张大合同志及其他工友同志们，多提意见，我们当竭诚接受，借资改正。
