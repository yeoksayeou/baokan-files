　　American Imperialism Attempts to Re-arm Japan
    People of Beijing, Shanghai, and Other Places Angrily Protest
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Sichuan have successively issued statements or held rallies and parades to oppose the US attempt to re-arm Japan and its plot to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan.
    The Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and the Christian Churches and Organizations Branch, issued a declaration opposing the American imperialists' re-arming of Japan, stating: "The Chinese people have suffered greatly from the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression, and our Christian churches have also suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism. We firmly oppose the American imperialists' sinister plot to arm Japan and will never allow Japanese militarism to be revived. On the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, we firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of December 4th last year. We call on Christians across the country to continue to carry out the movement to defend world peace and oppose American aggression, and to do everything possible to expose the American imperialists' evil plot to arm Japan, and to fight to defend peace in Asia and the world."
    The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated that all members of the party are determined to fight alongside the people of the whole country to smash this conspiracy of American imperialism. The statement of the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League stated: Any separate peace treaty with Japan that does not include China and the Soviet Union will endanger peace in Asia and will never be tolerated or accepted by our Chinese people. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League stated: We, the people of Taiwan, have not only suffered deeply from the aggression of Japanese imperialism, but also suffer today from the aggression of American imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Therefore, we cannot tolerate such illegal actions by American imperialism. The statements of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee all expressed their determination to continue to carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea with all their strength, and to resolutely smash the American imperialist plot to support the Japanese reactionaries.
    The Guangzhou literary and art circles held a demonstration parade on the 3rd to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the American re-arming of Japan. More than 6,000 professional and amateur writers, artists, dramatists, musicians, dancers, film workers, and teachers and students of art schools from the city participated in the conference. The conference was held at 1 p.m. in the square in front of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. A demonstration parade was held after the meeting.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, the Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, and other organizations issued statements opposing the American imperialist plot to arm Japan. The workers of the Guangdong Cement Factory bitterly recalled the heinous crimes of the Japanese invaders during the occupation period and their personal tragic experiences. Sun Linye, an old technician, was captured by Japanese invaders in Dushan during the War of Resistance, his wife was frightened to death by artillery fire, and his children disappeared, ruining his family. He angrily said: We will never allow American imperialism to support the Japanese bandits to come and spoil us again.
    The statement of the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression stated: During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Northern Jiangsu region alone lost more than 325,000 people, of whom more than 185,300 were killed by Japanese invaders. In addition, more than 3 million houses were destroyed, and more than 60 million dan of grain and 360,000 head of cattle were lost. Today, American imperialism brazenly violates international agreements and ignores the great sacrifices of the Chinese people in defeating the Japanese invaders, and is actively arming the Japanese invaders, attempting to carry out aggression. The Chinese people can never allow this. The statement of the Northern Jiangsu Democratic Women's Federation stated: The Japanese aggressors caused countless women in our country to lose their husbands, and countless children to lose their parents. The bloody crimes are still fresh in our minds, and we will never allow American imperialism to do this. The Northern Jiangsu Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Farmers' Association, the Northern Jiangsu Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, and other organizations also issued statements expressing their opposition.
    The people of Luzhou and Leshan in Southern Sichuan, who had suffered from the crazy bombing of Japanese planes during the War of Resistance Against Japan, successively held rallies to oppose the American imperialist plot to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and to arm Japan. Workers, peasants, and industrialists and businessmen in Luzhou held a protest meeting on January 29. Seventy percent of the industrial and commercial households in Leshan City were destroyed by Japanese planes. The city also held a protest meeting on the 30th. The attendees unanimously stated that they would resolutely abide by the patriotic convention, actively pay taxes, and donate money to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers, and use practical actions to smash the American imperialist aggression conspiracy.
