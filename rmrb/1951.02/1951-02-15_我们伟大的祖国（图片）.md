    Our Great Motherland
    Today is the anniversary of the death of Gu Yanwu, a famous patriotic thinker of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties in our country. Gu Yanwu was born in 1613 and died on February 15, 1682. He left his hometown of Kunshan, Jiangsu, and traveled to many parts of the country, conducting extensive investigations and research on military affairs, politics, economics, social systems, history, geography, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and wrote books based on them. He advocated a spirit of creation and a pragmatic attitude, shouted "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," and actually participated in the people's struggle against the oppression of the Qing Dynasty at that time.

    我们伟大的祖国
    今天是我国明末清初著名的爱国主义思想家顾炎武的忌辰。顾炎武生于一六一三年，死于一六八二年二月十五日。他曾离开家乡江苏崑山，游历国内许多地方，对于军事、政治、经济、社会制度和历史、地理、农林、水利等进行广泛的调查研究，并据以写成著作。他提倡创造精神和求实态度，高呼“天下兴亡匹夫有责”，并实际参加了当时的反对清朝压迫的人民斗争。
