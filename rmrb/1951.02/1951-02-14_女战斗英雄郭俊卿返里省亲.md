　　Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing Returns Home to Visit Relatives
　　Zhu Cheng
　　Before the Spring Festival, female combat hero Guo Junqing returned to her hometown, which she had been away from for five years - Balin Left Banner (i.e., Lindong County) in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia. The elders of the entire village and the masses from surrounding villages rushed to visit and express their regards.

　　In Guo Junqing's eyes, her hometown has changed greatly, and the biggest change is that her family has completely escaped the begging life of the past and is living a comfortable life. During the land reform in 1948, her family was allocated two houses, twenty-four mu of land, and two cows. Last year's harvest was good, so this year they slaughtered a pig for the Spring Festival and milled a lot of flour. The whole family is wearing neat cotton clothes. This is completely different from the scene before liberation, when her family was so poor that they only had one pot and a small basket. In winter, Guo Junqing's mother wore thin, torn clothes to grind flour and cook millet porridge for the children!

　　Another thing that made Guo Junqing feel excited and happy was that, over the years, her mother, under the education and assistance of the local Communist Party organization and the People's Government, and relying on her own hard work and frugality, has become a good military family member unanimously praised by the whole village. She can do everything herself with her son, so as to reduce the burden on the government. Although there was a poor harvest the year before last and not enough grain to eat last year, she did not completely rely on government care. In addition to cultivating her own land, she also helped neighboring families with weeding, which not only helped them get through the summer famine but also earned two sets of unlined clothes. The local People's Government is very concerned about the Guo family. The district head visits Guo's house every time he comes to the village to see if they have any difficulties. For this reason, Guo Junqing personally went to the district People's Government to express her gratitude after returning home.

　　Guo Junqing received a warm welcome and hospitality from the People's Governments and the masses along the way during this trip home to visit her relatives. On January 28, when she passed through Chengde, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial People's Government, the Women's Federation, and more than a dozen other units held a grand reception and sent a special car to escort her. She received the same warm reception in Chifeng, Wudan, and other places. When she arrived in Balin Left Banner, the county head personally led government personnel to her residence to express their regards. Wherever Guo Junqing went, there was an endless stream of young students and women who came to visit her.

　　女战斗英雄郭俊卿返里省亲
　　朱成
    春节前夕，女战斗英雄郭俊卿返回了分别五年的故乡——内蒙昭乌达盟巴林左旗（即林东县）。全村的父老和周围村庄的群众，都惊喜地赶来探望和慰问。
    家乡在郭俊卿的眼里已经大大变了样，而变化最大的是她家已完全摆脱了过去讨乞的生活，过着安乐的日子。在一九四八年的土地改革中，她家曾分到两间房子，二十四亩地和两头牛。去年收成较好，今年春节就杀了一口猪，磨了许多面，全家都穿上了整齐的棉衣裳。这和解放以前她家穷的只有一口锅和一只小筐，冬天郭俊卿的母亲穿着破单衣去推磨，给孩子们煮谷沫子粥喝的情景是完全不同了！
    使郭俊卿感到兴奋愉快的另外一件事就是数年来她的母亲在当地共产党组织和人民政府的教育帮助下，凭着自己的勤劳节俭，已成为全村一致赞扬的好军人家属。她事事都能自己带着儿子干，以减轻政府的负担。虽然前年欠收，去年粮不够吃，但她也未完全依赖政府照顾。她除了种好自己的地外，并帮助旁的人家拔草，不但度过了夏荒，还挣下两身单衣。当地区人民政府对郭家是很关心的，区长每次到该村来都要亲到郭家看看有什么困难。为此，郭俊卿回家后曾亲到区人民政府致谢。
    郭俊卿此次返里省亲，沿途曾受到各地人民政府和群众的热烈欢迎和招待。一月二十八日她路经承德时，热河省中国共产党省委会、省人民政府、妇联等十余单位曾召开了盛大的招待晚会，并派专车相送。在赤峰、乌丹等地她也都受到了同样热烈地招待。当她抵达巴林左旗时，县长曾亲率政府人员前往住地慰问。郭俊卿每到一地，前来访问的青年学生和妇女总是络绎不绝。
