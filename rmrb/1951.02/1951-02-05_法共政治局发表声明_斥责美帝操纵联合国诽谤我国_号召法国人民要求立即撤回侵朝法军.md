Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 4th: The Central Politburo of the French Communist Party issued a statement on February 2nd, denouncing the United Nations General Assembly for illegally passing a slander case against China instigated by US imperialism. The full text of the statement is as follows:

"The Central Politburo of the French Communist Party condemns the slanderous attitude of the majority of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, who, under the orders of the aggressors who are invading the Korean people - the American imperialists - have launched a new provocation against the People's Republic of China.

"The Washington rulers, who decided to continue and expand the war in Korea, are against the withdrawal of foreign troops; they are unwilling to let the Koreans solve their own affairs, they oppose the resolution of the Taiwan issue and oppose the People's China attending the United Nations.

The Central Politburo of the French Communist Party condemns Plevin's shameful kowtowing to the American masters, asking them to prolong the Korean War and thereby establish a base to facilitate its expansion in other countries in the Far East, mainly in Vietnam, which has increasingly turned into a base for war against China.

In such a situation that shows the danger of war is becoming more and more serious, and at the same time reflects the great resistance of the people of all countries, the Central Politburo of the French Communist Party calls on the French working masses to unite and fight to complete the following two tasks: First, condemn the American imperialists as aggressors in the invasion of Korea, and force the immediate withdrawal of the French navy and army sent to Korea; Second, demand immediate peace in Vietnam and the withdrawal of the expeditionary force."

　　法共政治局发表声明
    斥责美帝操纵联合国诽谤我国           
    号召法国人民要求立即撤回侵朝法军
    【新华社布拉格四日电】法国共产党中央政治局于二月二日发表一项声明，斥责在联合国大会非法通过美帝国主义诬蔑中国的诽谤案，声明全文如下：
    “法国共产党中央政治局斥责联合国大会政治委员会多数派的诽谤态度，他们在侵略朝鲜人民的侵略者——美帝国主义的命令下，对中华人民共和国发动了新的挑衅。
    “决定在朝鲜继续战争并扩大战争的华盛顿统治者们，是反对撤退外国军队的；他们不愿让朝鲜人自己解决他们自己的事情，他们反对解决台湾问题并反对人民中国出席联合国。
    法共中央政治局斥责普利文可耻地卑躬屈膝要求美国主子们延长朝鲜战争，并借此建立便利其在远东其他国家扩张的基地，主要地是在已日益转变为对中国作战基地的越南。
    在这样一种显示战争危险益趋严重而同时又反映着各国人民伟大反抗的情况下，法共中央政治局号召法国劳动大众为争取完成下列两项任务团结起来进行斗争：一、斥责美帝国主义者为侵略朝鲜的侵略者，并迫使法国派往朝鲜的海军和陆军立即撤回；二、要求立刻给越南以和平并撤回远征军。”
