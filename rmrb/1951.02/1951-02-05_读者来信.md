    Tianjin Railway Bureau Tianjin Station: Mei Zhongsan's Shunting Team Achieves Six Months Without Accidents

    The Mei Zhongsan shunting team at Tianjin Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau gloriously completed 50,263 shunting operations without any accidents from August 1, 1950, to January 22, 1951, setting a new record for the entire bureau.

    Mei Zhongsan's shunting team is responsible for the dismantling and marshalling of all arriving and departing trains on the down line in the Tianjin Station's operational activities. Their No. 201 shunting engine is also the busiest locomotive. On the down line's twelve tracks, half are downhill and half are curved, and the lighting equipment is inadequate. Under these circumstances, they were able to achieve such results mainly due to: (1) Mei Zhongsan displayed a high degree of responsibility, understanding the condition of the vehicles before starting work. Before starting operations, he consulted with the driver based on his understanding of the situation and pointed out precautions based on the different situations each day. He established various communication methods in his work. For example, during nighttime operations, to prevent signal lights from being extinguished by the wind or difficult to see in the fog, he used a whistle instead of signals. When encountering goods loaded with dangerous or fragile items, he followed self-developed day and night signal display methods to prompt the driver to pay attention and prevent collisions. (2) In operation, they strictly followed regulations. Each time a vehicle was shunted, they conscientiously performed call and response after displaying signals. They diligently practiced the "three no-gos" (no go if the signal is incorrect, no go if the line is not clear, no go if communication is incomplete), the "four diligences" (diligent eyes, diligent mouth, diligent legs, diligent hands), and the "five attentions" (attention to the position of the vehicles, attention to handbrakes, attention to air hoses, attention to couplers, attention to dangerous goods vehicles), and therefore never caused accidents due to misreading signals or presuming the movement of the train. (3) They humbly learned from the experience of youth shunting teams, strengthened joint labor and clear division of labor, and assigned dedicated personnel to disconnect air hoses and uncouple. The stoker on the locomotive was regularly assigned to help observe the route and identify signals. In addition, they were brave in criticism and self-criticism. For example, when colliding with vehicles during shunting or using excessive force during shunting, even if no accident occurred, all workers would take the initiative to review the incident after work.

    As the patriotic production competition deepens, today, the workers of Mei Zhongsan's shunting team have unanimously and firmly stated: they will continue to complete 80,000 shunting operations without accidents on this basis and challenge all shunting teams across the railway to strengthen transportation capacity.

            Expedite the Implementation of Purchasing and Bartering on Credit

    Editor:

    I read the letter "Cotton Farmers Welcome Purchasing and Bartering on Credit" by Comrade Liu Chunyi of the Xinji Branch of the Huasha Cloth Company, published in the Reader's Letters column on January 26, and I truly believe this is a method supported by the farmers. This is taking care of the interests of the farmers. It fully demonstrates the people's government's meticulous concern for the farmers.

    In the past, farmers were exploited everywhere. After finally achieving a good harvest, they were disheartened by the blows from purchasing merchants. This is the so-called "cheap grain hurts farmers." If they don't sell, they can't buy the items they urgently need, so such a harvest is equivalent to a poor harvest. Even if slightly better-off middle-income households can wait for higher market prices before selling, how many are there? I believe the government's implementation of purchasing and bartering on credit does not cause farmers to suffer losses in any way, so I hope this method will be implemented universally as soon as possible, and it will definitely achieve great results. However, the cooperative in this city only arranged credit purchasing for individual producing villages for peanuts, without taking into account the need for every village to sell urgently. For example, in Siwangfu Village in the suburbs of Beijing, more than a dozen households that planted peanuts last year have not yet sold them, and everyone is very anxious. I hope the relevant departments will pay attention to this to meet the needs of the farmers.

     Turned-Over Farmers in Wangping Village Prepare to Comfort Families of Martyrs and Soldiers During the Spring Festival

    Editor:

    Our Wangping Village in Wanping Third District was originally a very poor little village. More than one hundred households had a total of only nine hundred acres of land, with an average of only two acres of sloping land per person. During the Kuomintang era, people never had enough to eat, and their clothes could not cover their bodies. Now the people of Wangping Village have turned over, and the harvest from the fields is gradually increasing. This year, the whole village also organized a small coal mine cooperative. One hundred and fifteen of the one hundred and sixteen households in the village participated in this cooperative, and the lives of the people in the village are gradually improving. When the farmers think of their own lives, they think of the revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and also of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.

    There are twelve families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in Wangping Village, six of whom have relatively difficult lives. In order to express their respect to the families of martyrs and soldiers, the farmers of the whole village have already bought a bag of white flour, one hundred catties of cabbage, and six thousand catties of coal to send to these families of martyrs and soldiers. The farmers have also prepared entertainment programs to visit the families of martyrs and soldiers during the Spring Festival.
                                                             Shi Xirong

        Prevent the Private Slaughter of Oxen

    Editor:

    With the Spring Festival approaching, the amount of beef in the market towns of Weixian County, Hebei Province, is increasing daily, and the private slaughter of oxen is occurring every day. According to reports from the masses, many oxen are being slaughtered in the counties of Pingyuan, Nanle, Neihuang, and Anyang, which border Weixian County. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities in these counties pay attention to inspection.

        Cattle Deaths Occur in Huangchuan, Henan, and Other Places

    Editor:

    During the recent snow, the phenomenon of plowing cattle being frozen and starved to death was common in various parts of the Huangchuan Prefecture, Henan Province. In Dongpu Township, Zhuhe District, Luoshan County, three plowing cattle and one calf were frozen to death. Three plowing cattle were frozen to death in the Langgan District. The phenomenon of cattle deaths was quite common in the second, fifth, eighth, and ninth districts of Gushi County. Among them, 70 head have already died in the Luoji District. Thirty-nine head died in Yudain, Huangchuan. Farmers in the Xuezi District of Huangchuan (severely affected area) lacked fodder and believed that selling meat and hides after the death of the cattle would earn more money than selling live cattle. Therefore, they did not take good care of the plowing cattle. More than 20 head also starved to death during the recent snowfall.

    The Huangchuan Prefecture has now instructed all counties to educate farmers on protecting plowing cattle, promptly conduct thorough inspections of the issuance of fodder loans and their effects, and urge farmers to stack more grass in the cattle sheds, diligently remove manure, and feed more cottonseed cake or fried cottonseed flour.

        Important Insecticidal Plant "Pyrethrum"

    Editor:

    The article "Develop Domestic Agricultural Drugs" in the People's Daily on January 22 mentioned an important insecticidal plant, "pyrethrum." Now I would like to briefly introduce "pyrethrum." "Pyrethrum" is not a novel plant in China, but in the past, the reactionary government did not care about the harvest of farmers. The planting and use of pyrethrum for agricultural pest control has never been promoted. After liberation, the Xingtai Farm began trial planting. The advantages of "pyrethrum" are that it is rapid in effect and harmless to humans and animals. General sandy soils in North China can all be cultivated. It is best to promote it in fruit tree areas, cotton-producing areas, and vegetable areas. The Xingtai Farm already has simple finished products, such as pyrethrum insecticidal powder, leachate, mosquito coils, and bedbug medicine. Emulsions are being tested. "Pyrethrum" has good effects on killing pear star caterpillars, pear inchworms on fruit trees, flea beetles on vegetables, rice stem borers on rice crops, cutworms on millet, cotton aphids, and spider mites. In the autumn of 1950, it was used to treat 250 mu of flea beetles in Xingtai Chengguan, proving that not only the flowers of pyrethrum have insecticidal power, but also the leaves of pyrethrum can kill insects (six taels of leaf powder mixed with 30 catties of water can kill cotton aphids).

        Farmers in the Suburbs of Nanchong City, Northern Sichuan, Launch a Cultural Learning Craze

    Editor:

    After the struggles of rent reduction, bandit suppression, and anti-hegemony in the rural suburbs of Nanchong City, Northern Sichuan, the lives of the turned-over farmers have improved, and they are all eager to learn culture. At present, cultural learning has been widely launched in the 25 villages in the suburbs, and many people, both men and women, young and old, have joined the learning craze. Blackboards have become common, and there are blackboard facilities in village offices and roadsides. New messages are changed every day. In addition to excerpts from the Northern Sichuan Daily and the Northern Sichuan Farmers' Daily, most of them are local news. Blackboards are very popular among the masses, and they have become an indispensable learning ground for farmers. Night schools are also very common. There are 4,667 students in the 72 night schools in the suburbs of Nanchong City. Each student has a copy of the "Farmers' Three-Character Classic." Every evening, students from night schools in various villages gather from scattered places. Each village night school maintains more than a hundred people, and they study happily every night without being absent. In order to learn better, many villages are divided into groups and integrate learning with production. For example, the eight learning groups of the second bao of Wufeng Township are also production groups. After every three nights of study, they convene all the students to check the learning of each group to encourage each other. The Farmers' Association attaches great importance to everyone's learning and holds a symposium of group leaders and small teachers every five days to check and arrange learning. This makes everyone's learning enthusiasm higher. Many villages have created new learning methods. They use literacy cards to help memory, writing the words learned each day on them and changing them after they can read and write. Almost all night school students in Wufeng Township have a literacy card, and they carry literacy cards with them at all times to study. When they return home in the evening, they hang them on the wall, and farmers take them to the fields.

    The farmers in the suburbs of Nanchong City have realized the importance of learning culture. Among them, popular reading materials on rent reduction and deposit refunds, the Land Reform Law, and the Marriage Law have become important things to study. Some village Farmers' Association offices have opened reading rooms for books and newspapers to improve the masses' awareness and cultural level in all aspects. At present, this learning craze is being carried out enthusiastically.

    天津铁路管理局天津车站  梅仲三调车组半年无事故
    天津铁路管理局天津车站梅仲三调车组，自去年八月一日到一月二十二日，光荣完成五万零二百六十三钩无事故，创全局最高纪录。
    梅仲三调车组在天津站运转业务中，担任下行线全部到发车的解体和编组，他的二○一号调车机也是全部作业最忙的一台机车。在下行十二股道中，一半是下坡道，一半是弯道，照明设备又不足。在这样的情况下，他能够获得了这样的成绩，主要是由于：（一）梅仲三发挥了高度的负责精神，上班前先行了解车辆情形。开始作业时就根据了解情况，与司机交换意见。并根据每日不同情况提示注意事项。在工作中订出各种联系方法。如在夜间作业时，为了防止信号灯被风刮灭或夜里有雾不易辨认，就以口笛代替信号。遇有装载危险品或易碎品时，按照自行制定白天与夜间信号显示方法，促使司机注意，防止发生冲撞事故。（二）在作业中，严格遵守规章。车辆每次甩挂时，在显示信号后，必认真实行呼唤应答。他们励行三不走（信号不对不走，线路不开通不走，联络不彻底不走）、四勤（眼勤、嘴勤、腿勤、手勤）和五注意（注意车辆停留位置，注意手闸、注意风管、注意连结器、注意危险品车辆），因此从未因误认信号或臆测行车而造成事故。（三）他们虚心学习了青年调车组的经验，加强了联合劳动和明确分工，指定专人摘风管、摘钩，机车上经常指定司炉帮助了望进路和辨认信号。此外他们勇于批评与自我批评，例如调车时冲撞车辆或溜放时用力过猛等，虽未发生事故，但下班后全体工友必主动检讨。
    在目前爱国主义生产竞赛日益深入，今天，梅仲三调车组的工友们，一致坚决表示：要在这个基础上，保证继续完成八万钩无事故，并向全路的调车组挑战，增强运输力量。

            赶快实行赊购换购办法
    编辑同志：
    我见到了一月二十六日读者来信栏发表花纱布公司辛集支公司刘纯一同志的“棉农欢迎赊购换购”一信，我确实相信这是为农民所拥护的办法。这是照顾农民的利益。充分表现了人民政府对农民的关心是无微不至了。
    过去的农民是处处受剥削，好容易赶上个丰年，却被收购商人打击得垂头丧气，这就是所谓“谷贱伤农”。不卖吧，买不回自己所急需的物品，这样的丰收还是等于歉收。即使稍能存放的中农户等到行市高些再卖，但这有几户呢？政府实行赊购换购办法我认为是毫不使农民吃亏，因此我希望这办法赶快普遍实行，一定会收到很大效果。但本市合作社，收买花生，只对个别出产村落布置了赊购工作，未照顾到每村都有急需出售的要求。如京郊四王府村去年种花生的十余户，到现在还没有卖出，大家都很着急。希望有关部门予以注意，以满足农民的要求。

     王平村翻身农民准备在春节慰问烈军属
    编辑同志：
    我们宛平三区王平村，原来是一个很贫穷的小村。一百多户人家，一共只有九百多亩地，每人平均只有二亩坡坡地。国民党在时，人民从来没有吃饱过饭，衣服也遮不住身子。现在王平村人民翻了身，地里收成渐渐多了，今年全村还组织了一个小煤窑合作社，全村一百一十六户人家，一百一十五户参加了这个合作社，全村人民生活是渐渐好起来了。农民们想起自己的日子，就想起了革命烈士和革命军人，也想起了革命烈士家属和革命军人家属。
    王平村共有十二户革命烈士和革命军人家属，其中并有六户生活上是比较困难的。全村农民为了向烈军属表示敬爱，已经买了白面一袋，白菜一百斤，煤六千斤，送给这些烈军属，农民们并准备了游艺节目，以便在春节时去向烈军属们拜节。

        防止私杀耕牛
    编辑同志：
    春节来了。河北魏县各集镇牛肉日增，私杀耕牛的事连日发生。据群众反映与魏县交界的平原南乐、内黄、安阳等县杀牛的很多。因此我建议这几个县的有关机关注意检查。       河北魏县读者  史英波
        河南潢川等地发生死牛现象
    编辑同志：
    新年下雪期间，河南潢川专署各地，普遍发现耕牛被冻饿生病致死的现象。罗山竹河区东铺乡冻死耕牛三头，小牛一头。栏杆区冻死耕牛三头。固始二、五、八、九区死牛现象相当普遍。其中罗集区已死七十头。潢川余店死三十九头。潢川踅子区（重灾区）农民缺乏草料，并认为牛死后卖肉、卖皮比活牛还要多卖些钱，因而对耕牛的照顾不够周到，此次下雪期间，也饿死二十头以上。
    潢川专署现已指示各县对农民进行保护耕牛的教育，并迅速深入检查饲料贷款发放情形及其作用，督促农民在牛栏屋内多堆草，勤除牛粪，多喂棉子饼或炒好的棉子粉。              刘学章  李知平  潘传正
        重要杀虫植物“除虫菊”
    编辑同志：
    一月二十二日人民日报上“发展国产农用药物”一文中，曾谈到一种重要的杀虫植物“除虫菊”，现在我想简单地介绍一下“除虫菊”。“除虫菊”在我国并不是一种新奇植物，但过去反动政府不关心农民的收获，除虫菊的种植与用于农业杀虫也一直没有被提倡。解放后邢台农场开始试种。“除虫菊”的优点是效力迅速，人畜无害，华北一般砂质土壤全可以栽培。最好在果树区、产棉区、蔬菜区推广。邢台农场现已有简单的制成品，如除虫菊杀虫粉、浸出液、蚊香、臭虫药等，乳剂正试制中。“除虫菊”对于灭杀果树上的梨星毛虫、梨尺蠖、蔬菜上的猿叶虫、稻作物的稻苞虫、谷子上的夜盗虫、棉蚜虫和红蜘蛛等效果均佳。一九五○年秋天，曾在邢台城关试治猿叶虫二百五十亩，证明除虫菊不仅它的花有杀虫力，而且除虫菊的叶子也能杀虫（叶粉六两配水三十斤可以治死棉蚜）。                            邢台农场  张福民
        川北南充市郊区农民掀起学习文化热潮
    编辑同志：
    川北南充市郊区农村经过减租、清匪、反霸等斗争后，翻身农民生活改善了，都迫切要求学习文化。目前市郊二十五个村中普遍展开了文化学习，男女老少很多人都投入了学习的热潮。黑板报已经普遍地办起来了，村里办公处和路旁都有黑板报的设备，每天换一次新消息，除了摘录川北日报与川北农民报的内容外，大部分是登本地的新闻。黑板报很受群众欢迎，它已成为农民不可缺少的学习园地了。夜校也是很普遍，南充市郊区七十二处夜校中有学员四千六百六十七人，每个学员都有一本农民三字经，每天黄昏，各村夜校的学员都从住得很分散的地方集拢来，各村夜校人数都保持百余人，每天晚上都愉快地学习着，从不旷课。为了学习得更好，不少村都分了小组，并且使学习与生产结合，如舞凤乡第二保的八个学习小组同时也就是生产小组。他们每学习三晚上，就召集全体学员检查各小组的学习情况，以此互相督促。农民协会很重视大家的学习，每五天召开一次小组长及小先生座谈会，检查与布置学习。这样使得大家的学习情绪更高了。不少村创造了新的学习方法，他们利用识字牌帮助记忆。把每天学的字写在上面，会读、会写之后再换生字。舞凤乡差不多夜校学员们都有一个识字牌，他们随时都带着识字牌进行学习，晚上回到家里挂到墙上，农民到田里去也都带上。
    南充市郊的农民们，已经认识了学习文化的重要，在他们中间，有关减租退押、土地改革法、婚姻法等通俗读物，已成为学习的重要东西。有些村农协办公处都开设了书报阅览室，从各方面提高群众的觉悟和文化水平。目前，这种学习热潮正在热烈开展着。
