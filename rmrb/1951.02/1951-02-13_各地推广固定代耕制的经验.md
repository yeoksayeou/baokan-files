　　Experiences in Promoting Fixed Contract Farming Systems in Various Regions
　　Lin Hong
    Substituting for military families in farming is a complex and meticulous mass organizational task. In addition to strengthening leadership and conducting widespread and in-depth propaganda and education among the broad masses of cadres, making them aware of the importance of preferential treatment work and actively helping military families solve their difficulties, the quality of the substitute farming system is also an important issue. In the early stages of implementing substitute farming in various regions, the method of temporary dispatch of labor was generally adopted. Years of practice have proven that this method lacks fixed and unified standards for determining the number of mu of land, labor days, and the allocation of labor and animal power that the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers (hereinafter referred to as military families) should enjoy for substitute farming. It is difficult to achieve fairness and reasonableness, and temporary dispatch of labor adds many troubles to village cadres and easily affects the production plans of substitute farming households. Many military families and the masses are dissatisfied with this method, calling it "random conscription." Because this method has more disadvantages than advantages, various new forms of substitute farming have been created in recent years, such as contract farming, contract grain system, fixed substitute farming system, contract system, contract labor system, and subletting system. These methods are all better than the dispatch system, marking a step forward in substitute farming work.

    Although these new substitute farming methods have various different names, they have one thing in common: targeting the shortcomings of temporary dispatch of labor and fixing the substitute farming targets. We can call these methods fixed substitute farming systems. Generally speaking, this fixed substitute farming system has two forms, one called large-scale contract farming and the other is small-scale contract farming. The so-called large-scale contract farming is to first determine the number of mu of land that military families should enjoy for substitute farming. The method is for military families to self-report, the masses to evaluate, and the village people's congress to approve. Then, the land that one or several military families should enjoy for substitute farming is fixed for one household or one mutual aid team to contract. The village government negotiates with the military families and contractors to jointly agree on the number of labor days required for the substitute farming land and the output to be paid, which is approved by the village people's congress. The seeds and fertilizers required for the substitute farming land are the responsibility of the households enjoying the substitute farming. The types of crops to be planted on the substitute farming land are agreed upon by both parties. If the military family is unable to provide fertilizer, the contractor can help them accumulate fertilizer, which is calculated into the substitute farming labor. The contractor pays the grain to the military family in installments according to the agreed amount (to be discussed separately in case of reduced production due to irresistible disasters). All by-products of the substitute farming land, such as sorghum stalks and rice straw, also belong to the households enjoying the substitute farming. If the contractor is lazy in farming and the grain produced does not reach the agreed amount, they shall find their own way to compensate; however, if more grain is produced due to diligent farming, it belongs to the contractor. If the contractor is willing to hand over the extra production to the military family, they should be allowed to do so at their own discretion. As for the extra labor and animal labor that the contractor spends on cultivating the military family's land, it shall be borne equally by all the labor and animal power in the village that are obliged to perform substitute farming, and the compensation shall be made in labor or grain. The so-called small-scale contract farming is the same as the large-scale contract farming, the only difference being that it only fixes the substitute farming targets, the substitute farming land (in Chahar Province, there is another type of small-scale contract farming that does not fix the land), and the number of labor days required. The households enjoying substitute farming request labor from the substitute farmers according to the needs of cultivation. In addition to reducing many troubles for village cadres, this fixed substitute farming system has two main advantages: first, the substitute farming targets are fixed (large-scale contract farming also guarantees the output of the military family's land), so that the military family's land is not easily abandoned and their lives can be guaranteed to a certain extent; second, it strengthens the sense of responsibility of the substitute farmers, prompting them to cultivate intensively and increase the output of the substitute farming land, while at the same time not hindering the cultivation of their own land. Because the substitute farming land or the number of substitute farming labor days is determined in advance, they can be carried out according to their own plans when cultivating their own land and substituting for military families, avoiding the phenomenon of temporary dispatch of labor, perfunctory performance, and waste of human and animal power. However, large-scale contract farming also has shortcomings, namely, it can easily foster the dependency mentality of military families. Therefore, this method is suitable for military families with no labor force; if the military family still has some labor force and can manage agricultural production on their own, it is best to adopt small-scale contract farming.

    This fixed substitute farming system has been widely implemented in the old liberated areas and some new liberated areas in North China, Northeast China, Shandong, and Northwest China. In 1950, six counties in Shandong Province, including Penglai, Huangxian, and Qidong, reorganized the substitute farming work in 3,089 villages, of which 94.5% of the reorganized villages were fixed to households (small-scale contract farming), and 1.5% implemented the "contract system" (large-scale contract farming). In Songjiang Province in 1949, the area of contracted land (large-scale contract farming) was more than 96,000 mu, accounting for 33% of the total land owned by military families in the province. In Rehe Province in 1950, the area of contracted land accounted for 45.9% of the number of mu that should be substituted. In Hebei Province, 1,709 villages in counties such as Julu, Xingtai, Baixiang, Xinhe, Pingxiang, Longyao, Ningjin, and Huairou implemented fixed contract farming, accounting for 80.4% of the total number of villages in the above counties. In most counties in the Chahar South District of Chahar Province, the output of substitute farming land has almost reached the general level of the local area, and even exceeded it, thus providing a strong guarantee for the lives of poor military families. This achievement was most evident in 1950, fully proving that it is a better form of substitute farming work. In villages across the country that have already undergone land reform and have a relatively solid foundation, this system can be widely promoted. In many areas of Shanxi Province, the output of substitute farming land has exceeded the original contracted output. For example, the third district of Wuxiang exceeded the output by more than 270 dan of grain, and one village in Licheng exceeded the output by more than 13 dan of grain. In Erdonghuang Village, the fourth district of Wudan County, Rehe Province, a total of 222.5 mu of land was contracted to military families, with a planned total output of more than 15,000 jin, but the actual output was more than 22,000 jin.

    Although the fixed contract farming system is far superior to the dispatch system, attention must be paid to the following issues in order to achieve the desired results. First, when determining the number of mu of land and labor days that the whole village should enjoy for substitute farming and statistically allocating the labor and animal power participating in substitute farming, it must be fair and reasonable, and labor must be organized according to the production season. Only when military families and the masses do not suffer losses can the enthusiasm of both parties be brought into play and the spirit of the fixed substitute farming system can be correctly implemented. Second, the evaluation of the output of large-scale contract farming land should be based on the grade of the land and other specific conditions, and it must be comparable to the normal output of the same grade of land in the local area, and the consent of the military families and contractors should be obtained. Both contracting and output evaluation should be based on voluntariness, and all forms of coercion and commandism must be avoided. As for the period of output evaluation, it can be done before spring plowing or after autumn harvest. Third, the fixed substitute farming system saves village cadres a lot of trouble, but it would be a mistake to think that once the fixed substitute farming system is implemented, it can be left unattended, and it will still fail. Therefore, strengthening the supervision of village cadres is an important issue in promoting the fixed substitute farming system.

### 各地推广固定代耕制的经验

　　各地推广固定代耕制的经验
　　林洪
    代耕是一件复杂细致的群众组织工作，除应加强领导并在广大干部群众中进行普遍深入的宣传教育，使其认识优抚工作的重要意义，主动帮助军属解决困难外，代耕制度的优劣也是一个重要问题。各地在实行代耕的初期，一般采用临时派工的办法。多年来实行的结果证明，这种办法在确定烈、军、工属（以下简称军属）应享受代耕地的亩数，工数和摊派应代耕的劳畜力上，没有固定统一的标准，很难作到公平合理，而且临时派工，增加村干部许多麻烦，容易影响代耕户的生产计划。许多地方的军属和群众对这种办法都不满意，称之为“乱点兵”。因为这一办法的弊多利少，近年来各地已创造了许多种新的代耕形式，如包耕制、包粮制、固定代耕制、包干制、包工制和转租制等。这些办法都比派工制好，使代耕工作提高了一步。
    尽管这些新的代耕办法有着各种不同的名称，但却有一个相同之处，就是针对临时派工的缺点，把代耕对象固定下来了。我们可以称这些办法叫固定代耕制。一般说来，这种固定代耕制有两种形式，一种叫大包耕制，另一种是小包耕制。所谓大包耕制，是首先确定军属应享受代耕的土地亩数，办法是军属自报，群众评议，村人民代表大会通过。然后将一户或数户军属应享受代耕的土地，固定给一户或一个互助组承包，由村政府与军属和承包者商量，共同议定代耕土地所需工数和应缴纳的产量，经村人民代表大会通过。代耕土地所需的种子、肥料，均由享受代耕户负责。代耕土地种植何种作物，由双方自行协议。若军属无力拿出肥料，可由承包者助其积肥，折工计算入代耕工中。承包者按约定的数目，向军属分期缴粮（遇有不可抗拒的灾害而减产者另议）。代耕土地的一切副产物，如秫秸、稻草等，亦归享受代耕户所有。若承包者懒于耕作，所产粮食没有达到约定数，由其自行设法补偿；但因勤于耕作而多产粮食，则归承包人所有。若承包者愿将多产部分交给军属，应听其自便。至于承包者耕种军属土地所多出的人工畜工，则由全村应服代耕义务的劳畜力平均负担，以工或以粮抵偿。所谓小包耕制，办法和大包耕制相同，惟一的区别，是只固定代耕对象、代耕地（察哈尔省另有一种小包耕不固定地）和所需工数，由享受代耕户视耕作需要，向代耕者要工代耕。这种固定代耕制除去减少村干部许多麻烦外，还有两个主要优点：一、代耕对象固定（大包耕还保证了军属土地的产量），这样就使军属的土地不容易荒废，生活能够获得一定保障；二、加强了代耕者的责任心，促使其精耕细作，提高代耕土地的产量，同时又不妨碍代耕者自己土地的耕种。因为代耕地或代耕的工数是事前确定了的，在耕种自己的土地和代耕军属的土地时，都可以按照自己的计划进行，避免了临时派工，敷衍塞责，浪费人畜力的现象。不过，大包耕制也有缺点，就是容易助长军属的依赖心理，因此，这种办法适宜于毫无劳动力的军属；若军属尚有部分劳力，能够自己经管农业生产，最好采用小包耕制。
    这种固定代耕制，已在华北、东北、山东和西北等老区及部分新区普遍实行。山东省蓬莱、黄县、栖东等六县一九五○年整理了三○八九个村的代耕工作，其中固定到户（小包耕）的占已整理村庄的百分之九十四点五，实行“包干制”（大包耕）的占百分之一点五。松江省一九四九年包耕（大包耕）的土地有九万六千多亩，占全省军属所有土地的百分之三十三。热河省一九五○年包耕的土地，占应代耕数的百分之四十五点九。河北省巨鹿、邢台、柏乡、新河、平乡、隆尧、宁晋、怀柔等县，实行固定包耕的有一七○九个村，占上述各县总村数的百分之八十点四。察哈尔省察南区多数县份，代耕地的产量差不多都达到当地的一般水平，甚至还有超过的，因而使贫苦军属的生活得到有力保证。这一成绩以一九五○年表现得最明显，充分证明它是代耕工作中较好的一种形式。在全国业已经过土地改革，工作较有基础的村庄，这一制度都可以普遍推广。山西省许多地区的代耕地，都超过了原包产量，如武乡第三区就超产了二百七十多石粮食，黎城一个村超过了十三石多粮食。热河省乌丹县四区二东荒村，共给军属包耕土地二百二十二亩五分，原定总产量一万五千多斤，实际打了二万二千多斤。
    固定包耕制虽然远较派工制优越，但必须注意下面几个问题，才能收到预期的效果。第一、在确定全村应享代耕地亩、工数和统计分配参加代耕的劳畜力时，必须作到公平合理，并要按生产季节进行齐工。只有作到军属和群众都不吃亏，才能发挥双方的积极性，正确贯彻固定代耕制的精神。第二、大包耕土地产量的评定，应依土地的等级和其他具体条件为标准，必须作到与当地同级土地的常年产量不相上下，并应征得军属和承包者的同意。无论承包和评定产量，都应建筑在自愿的基础上，切忌任何形式的强迫命令。至于评产的时期，春耕前或秋收后都可以。第三、固定代耕制为村干部省去许多麻烦，但若错误地认为一经实行固定代耕制，就可以放任不管，仍会遭到失败。因此，加强村干部的检查督促，是推行固定代耕制中的一个重要问题。
