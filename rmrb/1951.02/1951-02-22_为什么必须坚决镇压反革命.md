Why We Must Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries

The "Regulations of the People's Republic of China for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" have been adopted by the 11th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The implementation of these regulations will greatly consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship.

As everyone has seen, the counter-revolutionary forces fundamentally defeated by the Chinese people are not reconciled to their demise. The bandits, secret agents, despots, reactionary secret societies, and other counter-revolutionary elements lurking on the mainland of China are still doing everything possible to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. These counter-revolutionary elements are still dreaming of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang "counter-attacking the mainland." They are still engaged in robbery, murder, sabotage of production, and even so-called "mainland guerrilla warfare." Such rampant counter-revolutionary activity cannot be tolerated by any revolutionary people.

The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not a measure of expediency, but a fundamental political task that a people's democratic state must complete responsibly to the people. In explaining the task of the people's democratic dictatorship, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people... under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, unite, form their own state, elect their own government, and exercise dictatorship over the running dogs of imperialism, that is, the landlord class and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who represent these classes, exercise dictatorship and dictatorship, suppress these people, and only allow them to behave properly and not allow them to talk nonsense or act recklessly. If they want to talk nonsense or act recklessly, they will be banned immediately and punished. ...Why do we have to do this? Everyone is very clear. If we don't do this, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish." (On People's Democratic Dictatorship) Mao Zedong's instruction, from the perspective of the unbridled activities of counter-revolutionary elements in the past period, seems even more correct. It can be said that wherever counter-revolutionary activity exists, the power of the people's democratic state is either destroyed or simply does not exist. Isn't that the case? If in a certain place, bandits and despots can blatantly murder farmers, members of peasant associations, and cadres, can arbitrarily rob the people of their property, and burn the people's houses, production tools, and products, while the people have no recourse, then what power does the people's democratic state have here? If this situation is allowed to exist, how can it be said that the people's revolution has been successfully completed? Of course not. On June 6th of last year, at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong again emphasized: "The Kuomintang reactionaries have adopted the method of bandit guerrilla warfare in some areas of the mainland, inciting a part of the backward elements to fight the people's government. The Kuomintang reactionaries have also organized many secret agents to oppose the people's government, spread rumors among the people, and attempt to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and the people's government, and attempt to alienate the unity and cooperation of all nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations. The agents have also carried out activities to sabotage the people's economic undertakings, and have adopted assassination methods against the Communist Party and the people's government personnel, and collected intelligence for imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries." Therefore, he instructed us: "We must resolutely eliminate all bandits, secret agents, despots, and other counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people." This is necessary to protect the people's interests and the people's state power from being destroyed, otherwise it would not be a people's democratic dictatorship, and the result would be a terrorist dictatorship of counter-revolutionary bandits, despots, and secret agents.

Some comrades do not understand that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a necessary completion of the people's democratic revolution, and they actually believe that even the incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements should be given "benevolent government" after the victory of the revolution. They seem to have forgotten that it was the result of the bloodshed and sacrifice of countless martyrs that enabled our people to overthrow the feudal, comprador, fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang reactionary regime and establish the revolutionary regime of the people's democratic dictatorship. This is the vast majority of the oppressed people rising up to oppress the small number of oppressors who have long oppressed the people. The state power has thus changed from the original organ of a small number of oppressors to today's organ of the vast majority of the people oppressing a small number of oppressors. Our people's revolutionary object is that small group of counter-revolutionary forces, namely the imperialists, feudalists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and their accomplices. Revolution and counter-revolution cannot coexist. The people have already given leniency to all those who are determined to break away from the counter-revolutionary camp and turn around to serve the people. The line between revolution and counter-revolution is now becoming clearer. The incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements who continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities will not willingly die themselves, so they must be thoroughly revolutionized, and they must never be allowed to revolutionize the people. All incorrigible bandits, secret agents, despots, landlords, and other counter-revolutionary elements have oppressed and humiliated countless good people in the past. Under their bloody clutches, countless people have been ruined and died unjustly. Now the people have turned over and are building their own beautiful life. How can we tolerate these counter-revolutionary elements continuing to disturb the people and make it impossible for them to live in peace?! Obviously, "mercy" towards these incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements is the greatest unkindness towards the people. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago in his "On People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We will never exercise benevolence towards the reactionaries and the reactionary acts of the reactionary classes. We only exercise benevolence within the people, and not towards the reactionaries and the reactionary acts of the reactionary classes outside the people." Our people's state and people's government must resolutely defend the interests of the people's revolution, and therefore must exercise dictatorship over the enemies of the people, and must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities.

The liberated Chinese people must not only strive to defend the interests already gained by the people's revolution, but also strive for production and construction, develop the people's national defense, economic, and cultural undertakings, and strive to realize the people's higher interests. However, the implementation of large-scale construction undertakings requires certain conditions. If these conditions are lacking, we must first strive to create these conditions. There are many conditions necessary for production and construction, one of the most important of which is to eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage the people's construction undertakings. Many painful experiences have proved that if we do not eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, we cannot or will have great difficulty in carrying out construction. Some of our enterprises, although through the active efforts of cadres and workers, improved production management, and launched revolutionary competitions, have made great achievements; however, because they are politically careless and factory security work is not strict, counter-revolutionary elements have taken advantage of the loopholes to carry out sabotage and destruction, so that the results of the labor and production of many cadres and workers for a long period of time are lost in one fell swoop. The Beijing Tram Company's crash production for several months the year before last was burned down by secret agents, who destroyed more than fifty trams in one fire, which is a recent example. Some of our comrades only see the side of revolutionary victory, only see the side of their own work achievements, and ignore the struggle against the sabotage and destruction activities of counter-revolutionary elements. They believe that revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people are the vast majority, and counter-revolutionary elements are only a very small number, so there is no need to be afraid of the sabotage and destruction of counter-revolutionary elements. This kind of understanding is very wrong. In his report to the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on March 3, 1937, Stalin criticized similar erroneous views.

Stalin pointed out: "The number of saboteurs is negligible, and there are millions who support the Bolsheviks, which is of course true, but it must not be said that the saboteurs cannot cause very serious damage to our cause. In order to carry out sabotage, it does not require a large number of people. In order to build the Dnieper Project, it requires tens of thousands of workers, but to destroy this project, perhaps at most only dozens of people are needed. In order to win a battle, it requires several armies of the Red Army, but in order to destroy this victory on the front line, it only requires a few spies in a certain army headquarters, or even in a certain division headquarters, who can steal the battle plan and hand it over to the enemy. To build a large railway bridge requires thousands of people, but to blow up this bridge, it only takes a few people. Examples like this are endless." This should arouse the high vigilance of all our cadres and the masses of the people. We must never blindly comfort ourselves and relax the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; but we should fully realize that only by eliminating counter-revolutionary elements can we have the possibility of carrying out large-scale construction. If it is said that the current counter-revolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated, therefore, large-scale economic construction cannot be carried out smoothly; then, we should strive to create conditions and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries as one of the necessary preparatory work for large-scale construction.

The struggle against counter-revolutionary elements is quite long-term and complex. It cannot be imagined that it can be decisively "accomplished in one battle" in one morning. Our country's people stand up with great heroic posture, and can develop so rapidly and victoriously in the political, military, economic, and cultural fronts, and win unprecedented reputation in the world. On the one hand, this will further enhance and consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm of our people, and further enhance the friendship and unity of our people and the people of all countries in the world who love peace and democracy; but on the other hand, the counter-revolutionary forces of the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who have been defeated by our people's revolution, will inevitably attack and destroy us more desperately in their final struggle near their death. From this, it is not difficult to understand why there are still sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements within our great country, which is loved by the vast majority of our people.

Has the social basis of the current counter-revolutionary elements been completely eradicated? No. Land reform has not yet been carried out in many areas of the country, and the landlord class and other feudal forces still exist; in some places, although the feudal forces have been overthrown, they are still trying to retaliate. The remnant bandit gang of the Kuomintang reactionaries is still occupying Taiwan temporarily, and is constantly preparing to "land." More importantly, the imperialist forces of aggression have not yet been eliminated in the world. They are constantly extending their spears of aggression and bloody claws of revenge towards us; they are also constantly instigating the desire for revenge among the feudal forces within our country. In the people's democratic dictatorship, all the counter-revolutionary elements who used to rely on the imperialist and Kuomintang bandit gang's counter-revolutionary rule and oppress the people for a living cannot arbitrarily bully the people and run rampant, and they are not determined to transform themselves and start a new life; these people are still delusional about restoring their past lives and continuing to maintain all kinds of connections with the counter-revolutionary forces and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Comrade Mao Zedong told us long ago in his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "All these counter-revolutionary activities are instigated by imperialism, especially American imperialism. These bandits, secret agents, and spies are all running dogs of imperialism." Therefore, on the issue of fighting against counter-revolutionaries, we should be highly vigilant. As long as the imperialists who oppose the Chinese people continue to exist, the counter-revolutionary activities within our country will continue to occur. In the report by Stalin mentioned earlier, he warned the comrades of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "There are still many countries—bourgeois countries—that continue to live a capitalist life and surround the Soviet Union, waiting for an opportunity to invade it, smash it, or at least damage its power and weaken it. Our comrades have forgotten this basic fact, not knowing that it is precisely this fact that determines the basis of the mutual relationship between capitalist encirclement and the Soviet Union." He cited facts to illustrate how France in the Napoleonic era, and Tsarist Russia, Germany, Austria, and Britain, each sent their own detectives, assassins, military saboteurs, and murderers to other countries to carry out assassinations, sabotage, and espionage activities. He also cited facts to illustrate that the situation was the same between France, Britain, Germany, Japan, and the United States on the eve of World War II. Then he said: "May I ask, why should bourgeois countries treat the Soviet socialist state more gently and friendly than they treat their own bourgeois countries of the same kind? Why should the detectives, assassins, military saboteurs, and murderers they send to the Soviet rear be fewer than the detectives, assassins, military saboteurs, and murderers they send to the bourgeois countries of the same kind? Where did this conclusion come from? From a Marxist point of view, it would probably be more correct to make the opposite assumption, that is, shouldn't it be assumed that the assassins, detectives, military saboteurs, and murderers sent to the Soviet Union by bourgeois countries are two or three times more than those they send to the rear of any bourgeois country? As long as the capitalist encirclement remains, is it not obvious that there will continue to be assassins, detectives, military saboteurs, and murderers sent by foreign intelligence agencies in our rear to engage in activities?" Stalin's incisive analysis is equally applicable in principle to the situation our country is in today.

This tells us that the complete elimination of counter-revolutionary elements cannot be achieved in a very short period of time, and it should be sufficiently estimated that this is a long and arduous struggle. We should estimate that if we do not adopt a resolute and thorough approach in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, then, in the process of our country's future construction and development, the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries will be difficult to avoid. This is just as Stalin said to the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) comrades: "The greater our future progress and the more our achievements, the greater the hatred of the remnants of the exploiting classes that have been defeated for us, and they will be more determined to adopt more violent forms of struggle, more intensified to harm the Soviet state, and they will more use the most risky and desperate means of struggle to make a final struggle. It should be noted that the remnants of the classes that have been defeated in the Soviet Union are not isolated and helpless, and they receive direct assistance from enemies outside the Soviet Union. It is wrong to think that the scope of class struggle is limited to the territory of the Soviet Union. The front line of class struggle within the Soviet Union is simultaneously connected to the capitalist countries that surround us. The remnants of the classes that have been defeated are not unaware of this. Precisely because they know this, they will continue their risky and desperate attacks in the future." However, the people of our China, accepting the experience of the Soviet Union, should have confidence that as long as we adopt a resolute suppression policy, the activities of counter-revolutionaries will gradually decrease and eventually be eliminated.

Now we have the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" that meet the requirements of the vast majority of the people, which can guarantee the correct implementation of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries with leadership throughout the country in the future. Article 7 of the Common Program stipulates: "The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary principal elements who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For general reactionaries... if they continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely sanctioned." The Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries are precisely a concretization of this program. According to this regulation, not only can it prevent and correct all right-leaning or left-leaning deviations in the handling of counter-revolutionary cases, but also can guarantee the resolute elimination of all bandits, secret agents, despots, landlords, and other counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people, continue to complete the task of our country's people's democratic revolution, prepare the necessary conditions for our country's large-scale construction work in the future, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and protect the long-term interests of our people.

### 为什么必须坚决镇压反革命

　　为什么必须坚决镇压反革命
    “中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，已经中央人民政府委员会第十一次会议通过。这个条例的实施，将使我国人民民主专政大大地巩固起来。
    大家已经看到，为中国人民所根本打败了的反革命势力，并不甘心死亡。潜伏在我国大陆的土匪、特务、恶霸、反动的会道门和其他反革命分子，还在千方百计地进行反革命活动。这些反革命分子还在梦想着美国帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮来“反攻大陆”。他们还在抢劫杀人，破坏生产，甚至进行所谓“大陆游击”。这种猖狂的反革命活动，是任何一个革命的人民所决不能容忍的。
    镇压反革命，这不是什么一种权宜的措施，而是人民民主国家所必须对人民负责完成的根本政治任务。毛泽东同志在解释人民民主专政的任务时说：“人民……在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下，团结起来，组成自己的国家，选举自己的政府，向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。……为什么理由要这样做？大家很清楚。不这样，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。”（论人民民主专政）毛泽东同志的这个指示，从过去一个时期中反革命分子的放肆活动来看，更加显得正确了。可以说：凡是反革命活动存在的地方，就是人民民主国家权力被破坏或简直不存在的地方。事实难道不是如此吗？如果在一个地方，土匪恶霸可以明目张胆地杀害农民、农会会员和干部，可以任意地抢劫人民的财物，烧毁人民的房屋、生产工具和生产品，而人民无计可施，那么，这里还有什么人民民主国家的权力呢？这种情况如果听其存在，怎么能够说人民革命已经胜利完成了呢？当然不能。去年六月六日，在中国共产党第七届第三次中央全体会议上，毛泽东同志又曾着重指出：“国民党反动派在大陆若干地区内采取了土匪游击战争的方式，煽动了一部分落后分子，和人民政府作斗争。国民党反动派又组织许多秘密的特务分子和间谍分子反对人民政府，在人民中散布谣言，企图破坏共产党和人民政府的威信，企图离间各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结和合作。特务和间谍们又进行了破坏人民经济事业的活动，对于共产党和人民政府的工作人员采取暗杀手段，为帝国主义和国民党反动派收集情报。”因此，他指示我们：“必须坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。”这是保卫人民利益和人民国家权力不受破坏所必需的，非如此就不是人民民主专政，其结果就将成为反革命土匪恶霸特务的恐怖专政了。
    有一些同志不懂得镇压反革命是人民民主革命必要的完成，而竟然认为在革命胜利之后，对于怙恶不悛的反革命分子也要施以“仁政”。他们似乎忘记了由于无数先烈流血牺牲的结果，才使我国人民推翻了封建买办法西斯专政的国民党反动政权，建立了人民民主专政的革命政权。这就是广大被压迫的人民起来，压迫过去长期压迫人民的少数压迫者。国家政权就是这样从原来少数压迫者的机关，变成为今天最大多数人民压迫少数压迫者的机关。我们人民的革命对象，就是帝国主义封建主义国民党反动派及其帮凶们那一小撮反革命势力。革命和反革命是不能两立的。人民对于一切决心脱离反革命阵营，回过头来为人民服务的，都已经给予宽大了。革命和反革命的界限，现在愈加分明了。现在继续进行反革命活动的怙恶不悛的反革命分子，既不会自己甘心死亡，就必须彻底革掉它们的命，决不能容许它们来革掉人民的命。一切怙恶不悛的土匪、特务、恶霸地主等反革命分子，过去压迫凌辱了无数善良的人民，在他们血腥的魔爪下，曾不知有多少人民家破人亡，衔冤不白；现在人民翻身了，正在建设人民自己的美好的生活，难道还能够容忍这一些反革命分子继续来扰害人民，使人民不得安生吗！？很显然，对于这些怙恶不悛的反革命分子的“仁慈”，就是对于人民的最大的不仁。毛泽东同志在《论人民民主专政》一文中早已说过：“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为。”我们人民的国家和人民的政府是必须坚决保卫人民革命的利益的，因此也就必须对人民的敌人实行专政，就必须对反革命活动实行坚决的镇压。
    解放了的中国人民不但要努力保卫人民革命所已得的利益，而且还要努力于生产建设，发展人民的国防、经济和文化事业，争取实现人民更高的利益。但是，大规模建设事业的进行要有一定的条件，如果缺乏这些条件，就必须首先努力创造这些条件。生产建设所必需的条件有许多，其中很重要的一个条件，就是要消灭破坏人民建设事业的反革命分子。有许多惨痛的经验已经证明，如果不消灭反革命分子，我们就不能或者很困难进行建设。我们有些企业，虽然经过干部和工人群众积极努力，改善生产管理，开展革命竞赛，做出了很大的成绩；但是，因为在政治上麻痹大意，工厂保卫工作不严密，使反革命分子有隙可乘，实行暗害与破坏，就使得许多干部和工人群众很长时期劳动生产的结果损失于一旦。北京电车公司前年突击生产几个月，却被特务分子一把火烧毁了五十几辆电车，就是一个眼前的例子。我们有的同志只看到革命胜利的一面，只看到自己工作成绩的一面，而忽略了对反革命分子的暗害与破坏行为作斗争。他们认为革命干部和革命人民是最大多数，反革命分子只是极少数，因此就可以不必害怕反革命分子的暗害与破坏。这种认识是非常错误的。一九三七年三月三日斯大林在联共中央全会上的报告中就曾批评过类似这样的错误观点。
    斯大林指出：“暗害分子的人屈指可数，而拥护布尔塞维克的人却有千百万，这当然是对的，可是，决不能因此就说，暗害分子不能给我们的事业以极严重的损害。为要实行捣乱，实行暗害，并不需要大批的人。为要建筑第聂伯尔工程，是需要成千成万的工人，但要炸毁这一工程，也许至多只需要几十个人。为要打胜仗，是需要几军的红军，但为要在前线上破坏这一胜利，却只要在某个军部，甚至于只要在某个师部内有几个能偷出作战计划而交与敌军的侦探就够了。为要建筑大的铁路桥梁，需要数千人，但要炸毁这桥梁，却只需要几个人就够了。像这样的例子是举不胜举的。”这就应该引起我们所有的干部和人民群众的高度警惕，我们决不要盲目地安慰自己，放松了镇压反革命的工作；而应该充分认识惟有消灭了反革命分子，我们才有进行大规模建设的可能。如果说，目前反革命分子还没有完全被消灭，因此，大规模的经济建设还不可能顺利进行；那末，我们就应该努力创造条件，坚决镇压反革命，作为大规模建设的必要准备工作之一。
    和反革命分子作斗争，是相当长期的和复杂的，不能想像在一个早上就可以干脆地“毕其功于一役”。我们国家的人民以伟大的雄姿站起来，在政治、军事、经济、文化各个战线上能够这样迅速地胜利发展，在全世界博得空前未有的声誉，这在一方面会更加提高与巩固我国人民的爱国热情，更加增强我国人民与世界爱好和平民主的各国人民的友谊团结；但在另一方面，被我国人民革命所打败了的帝国主义和国民党匪帮的反革命势力，必然要在他们临近死亡的最后挣扎中，更加绝望地向我们进攻与破坏。从这里也不难了解，为什么在我们广大人民所热爱的伟大国家的内部，还会有反革命分子的破坏活动。
    目前反革命分子的社会基础是不是已经被彻底铲除了呢？没有。土地改革在全国有许多地区还没有进行，地主阶级及其他封建势力仍然存在；有的地方，封建势力虽然已经被压倒了，但是它们还企图报复。国民党反动派残余匪帮，暂时还占据着台湾，不断地准备“登陆”。更重要的是帝国主义侵略势力在世界上还未被消灭。他们时时刻刻都在向我们伸出侵略的矛头和报复的血爪；他们也时时刻刻在怂恿着我国内部封建势力进行报复的欲望。过去所有依赖帝国主义和国民党匪帮的反革命统治、以压迫人民为生的反革命分子，在人民民主专政的国家中，既不能任意鱼肉人民、横行霸道，又没有决心改造自己、重新做人；这些人就仍然在妄想恢复过去的生活，继续与反革命势力保持千丝万缕的联系，进行反革命的活动。毛泽东同志在中共七届三中全会的报告中，早已告诉我们：“所有这些反革命活动，都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动。这些土匪、特务和间谍，都是帝国主义的走狗。”因此，在与反革命进行斗争的这一个问题上，我们应该高度地警惕。只要反对中国人民的帝国主义者继续存在一天，我们国内的反革命活动也就会继续发生。在前面所举的斯大林的报告中，他曾警告苏联共产党的同志们说：“还有许多国家——资产阶级国家，还继续过着资本主义的生活，并包围着苏联，时刻等待时机，以便实行侵犯它，打碎它，或者至少是要损害它的势力而削弱它。我们的同志竟忘记了这个基本事实，殊不知，恰是这事实决定着资本主义包围与苏联相互关系之基础。”他列举事实，说明拿破仑时代的法国，和帝俄、德国、奥国、英国之间，怎样各自派遣自己的侦探、暗害者、军事破坏工作者和杀人凶手到别国去进行谋刺、破坏和间谍活动。他又列举事实，说明第二次世界大战的前夜，在法国、英国、德国、日本和美国之间，情形也是如此。然后他说：“试问，资产阶级国家对待苏维埃社会主义国家，为什么应当比它们对待自己同类的资产阶级国家的态度柔和而友善些呢？它们派到苏联后方来的侦探、暗害者、军事破坏工作者以及杀人凶手，为什么应当比它们派到自己同类的资产阶级国家中去的侦探、暗害者、军事破坏工作者以及杀人凶手少些呢？这是从那里得来的结论呢？从马克思主义的观点看来，作相反的推测恐怕要比较更正确罢，就是说，岂不是应当认为，资产阶级国家所派到苏联来的暗害者、侦探、军事破坏工作者以及杀人凶手，要比它们派到任何一个资产阶级国家后方去的还多两倍三倍吗？只要资本主义的包围依然存在，则在我国后方便将继续有被外国侦探机关派来的暗害者、侦探、军事破坏工作者及杀人凶手从事活动，这岂不是显而易见吗？”斯大林的这个精辟的分析，对于我们的国家今天所处的情况是同样在原则上适合的。
    这就告诉了我们，要彻底消灭反革命分子，并不是很短的时间所能达到的，而应该足够地估计到这是相当长期的艰苦的斗争。我们应该估计到，如果我们在镇压反革命的斗争中，不采取坚决彻底的方针，那末，在我国今后建设发展的过程中，反革命的破坏就将难于避免。这又正如斯大林对联共同志们所说的：“我们今后的进展愈大，成绩愈多，则已被击破的剥削阶级之残余对我们的仇恨亦更甚，他们将更加决意采用更激烈的斗争方式，更其加紧损害苏维埃国家，他们将更利用最冒险拼命的斗争手段以作最后的挣扎。应当注意到，在苏联已被击破的阶级之残余，不是孤立无援的，他们从苏联境外的敌人方面得到直接的援助。如果以为阶级斗争的范围只限于苏联境内，那是错误的。苏联境内之阶级斗争战线，是同时连接到包围我们的资本主义国家内的。关于这一点，已被击破的阶级之残余，是不能不知道的。正因为他们知道这一点，他们今后也将继续其冒险拼命的袭击。”但是，我们中国的人民接受苏联的经验，应该有信心，只要我们采取坚决镇压的方针，反革命的活动就会日益减少，最后归于消灭。
    现在我们有了适应广大人民要求的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，这就可以保证今后在全国范围内有领导地贯彻实行正确的镇压反革命的政策。共同纲领第七条规定：“中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子……假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”惩治反革命条例，正是这一条纲领的具体化。根据这个条例，不但可以防止与纠正在处理反革命案件中的一切右的或左的偏向，而且可以保证坚决肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸地主及其他反革命分子，继续完成我国人民民主革命的任务，为我国今后大规模的建设工作准备必要的条件，以巩固人民民主专政，保卫我国人民长远的利益。
