　　Economic Life Trends
            Chongqing State-Owned Factories and Mines Improve Workers' Welfare
    In the past year, state-owned factories and mines in Chongqing spent over 12 billion yuan in cash on workers' welfare. According to statistics from just eight factories, more than 3,960 new workers' dormitories were built. Some workers who originally lived on boats on the river now have stable housing. In the past year, medical and health facilities in various factories and mines have also been greatly improved. Workers' medical expenses have increased from 5 jin of rice per person per month to 8 jin. Factories and mines without doctors have added doctors, and workers who need glasses and masks have been given them. Due to the improvement of medical and health conditions, the number of patients in each factory has decreased from 12% to 4%, and the number of absenteeism has decreased from 30% to 7%.
            Guizhou Province Completes 1950 Tax Revenue Task
    Guizhou Province successfully completed its 1950 tax revenue task by the end of last November. As of the end of June last year, tax revenue was only one-quarter of the annual target. After July, due to the victorious development of the anti-banditry situation in the province, transportation was unimpeded, which promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and various tax sources and collection areas expanded accordingly. At present, 75 tax bureaus and 143 tax offices have been established throughout the province. In the cities, various appraisal committees, tax research associations, and taxpayer groups of industrial and commercial households have been established. In the rural areas, there are anti-smuggling teams composed of farmers, and market management committees have been established in various market towns. Through the promotion and assistance of the above-mentioned organizations, the annual tax revenue task was quickly completed.
            Tong County District Largely Completes Land Reform Concluding Work
    In Hebei's Tong County District, 1,676 villages had completed the concluding work of land reform by the end of January—resolving the remaining issues of land reform and issuing land certificates. It is estimated that more than 300 villages will be fully completed by around February 20. A total of 865 cadres participated in this work. In this work, more than 7,000 rural party members were trained, which greatly helped the smooth progress of the work. Pinggu, Sanhe, Shunyi, Tongxian and other counties carried out a river mud digging campaign in the concluding work of land reform, digging nearly 2 million loads of mud, and built more than 1,600 new toilets.
