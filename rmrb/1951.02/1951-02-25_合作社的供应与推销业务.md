Cooperative's Supply and Marketing Business
    Zhou Jun
    Changing the "All-in-One Supply and Marketing" Method of Operation
    In the past year, cooperative economies have seen significant development nationwide due to support from governments at all levels and state-owned enterprises. As of the end of last September, there were already 25 million members. This massive people's economic organization is continuously developing and expanding. After consolidation, the capitalist management thinking at all levels of the cooperative is gradually being eliminated, methods have been changed, and the principle of upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives serving members has been implemented. Especially after the implementation of the quota system in the future, which will bring cooperatives into a standardized system, the relationship between members and cooperatives will become closer. The main part of their economic life – the marketing of agricultural and sideline products and the supply of production materials and daily necessities – will rely on the cooperative entirely or mostly for resolution. As a result, the commodities operated by cooperatives have increased, and the tasks have become more onerous. In order to complete the tasks entrusted by the members, and to supply the members with production materials and daily necessities cheaply and in a timely manner, and to sell agricultural and sideline products reasonably and quickly to meet the economic needs of the members, a new business operation method adapted to the task is necessary. If the "integrated operation" and "all-in-one supply and marketing" form is still implemented in business, it will not be able to cope with the increasingly complex situation of the business. In order to adapt to this development and learn from the Soviet experience, it is very necessary to divide the past comprehensive business into separate supply and marketing operations. The so-called supply business is to supply members with production materials and daily necessities from top to bottom. The marketing business is to organize the sales of agricultural and sideline products and raw materials produced by farmers (members) from bottom to top.
    What are the benefits of operating supply and marketing separately? Because there are specialized institutions for marketing and supply, they can be responsible for research and planning separately according to the requirements of the members, and implement separate use of funds. This not only enables the members' agricultural and sideline products to be sold quickly at reasonable prices, and living and production materials to be supplied cheaply and in a timely manner, truly meeting the requirements of the members, but also makes it easier to complete the task of purchasing native products and raw materials on behalf of the state. Phenomena such as blind supply and marketing, backlog of funds, uncoordinated supply and marketing, and lack of mutual care produced by "all-in-one supply and marketing" can be avoided. In addition, the separation of supply and marketing also creates convenient conditions for implementing economic accounting and rational operation. For example, some cooperatives have a total of 1.3 billion yuan in funds, and the purchase of cotton from members accounts for 1.1 billion yuan. The members' demand for production and living materials cannot be met, which greatly affects the supply business to the members. Conversely, funds can be used reasonably and separately to meet the requirements of the members.
    According to the experience of the cooperatives in the Northeast provinces during this period, it is believed that after the separation of supply and marketing, the scope of business is clearer than before, which is convenient for operation, and gradually changes the chaotic phenomenon in the past business; it is also easier to grasp the business situation and materials of the lower-level cooperatives.
  Shortcomings in the Supply Business of Cooperatives and Methods for Improvement
    The task of the supply business of cooperatives is not only to supply members with production and living materials in a planned manner, and to supply industrial and agricultural products cheaply and in a timely manner to consumers and producers (members), but also to actively stimulate production, influence production, and produce according to the needs of consumers, to achieve planned production. At the same time, link individual consumers, change the free market into an organized market, and widely carry out internal commerce of cooperatives between cities and rural areas, between counties, and between provinces, and establish a vertical and horizontal cooperative trade network, so as to powerfully cooperate with the major tasks of national economic construction.
    Although cooperative enterprises have made great progress in the past year and have played a certain role in production, disaster relief, and organization of urban and rural trade, there are still serious shortcomings in the supply business, such as chasing the market, blind operation, not starting from the needs of members, only thinking from the preferences of cadres, and not operating according to the season. As a result, some cooperatives operate coal, not starting from the needs of the members, but focusing on the difference in prices between the producing area and the selling area, ordering coal from the mine and supplying it to the free market. Some cooperatives blindly ordered woolen sweaters, and as a result, the lower-level cooperatives did not need much, and more than a thousand pieces were backlogged and could not be sold for several months. Some rural cooperatives went to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of consumer goods such as razor blades, razor holders, lunch boxes, women's zipper shoes, high-heeled shoes, dance socks, and baby diapers, etc. Because they were not suitable for the needs of farmers, they had to be transported to Tianjin for resale. Some cooperatives transported cool mats after the beginning of autumn, and because the season had passed, they were stored for a long time. There are also umbrellas transported in sacks, with the paint worn off, making them difficult to sell. This seriously hindered the normal development of cooperatives and rational operation.
    How should the supply business of cooperatives be done? It should be changed from blind operation to planned supply. In the past year, some cooperatives have had the phenomenon of blind operation in trade work, such as making plans based on estimates, planning to supply a certain number of goods based on the total population needs of the province, or following the purchase of a certain commodity by local merchants. To change this practice, the first thing is to strengthen the investigation and statistics work of the grassroots cooperatives. This is the key to planned supply. Grassroots cooperatives should use member representative meetings or member group meetings to investigate the actual needs of each member every month, every season (such as the sowing season, Spring Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, etc.) or throughout the year for the types, quantities, brands, specifications, and delivery dates of production materials and daily necessities. The grassroots cooperatives should comprehensively compile statistics, and under the circumstances that they can do what they can and the production area is nearby, they can organize "joint purchases" and "credit purchases." For example, if members need edible oil, fertilizer, etc., and there is an oil mill nearby, the grassroots cooperative can organize members to pay in advance to purchase and distribute; or sign a contract or agreement with the oil mill, take the goods first, distribute them when they arrive, and collect money to pay the bill. This method saves funds and can quickly solve the requirements of the members. In addition, for local commodities, grassroots cooperatives can purchase and supply them themselves. For commodities that the grassroots cooperatives cannot supply, they should formulate plans (including commodity types, brands, local market prices, delivery dates, etc.) on a monthly, quarterly, or seasonal basis and submit them to the county joint cooperative for resolution. After receiving the retail plans of all the grassroots cooperatives in the county, the county joint cooperative will comprehensively compile statistics and resolve them according to the above methods. The county cannot solve the problems, submit them to the province, and the parts that the provincial and large administrative region joint cooperatives cannot supply are submitted to the national general cooperative for resolution. In this way, retail plans are made from bottom to top, and then supplied from top to bottom according to quality, quantity, and plan, supplemented by the "level-by-level ordering system," and blind operation can be avoided.
    While implementing planned operation, cooperatives should also pay attention to issues such as commodity transportation, storage, and cost. The first is to deliver goods directly to reduce transportation costs. In order to achieve cheap supply and give members material benefits, it is necessary to implement direct supply, reduce unnecessary links in the commodity circulation process, and send goods directly from the production site to the consumers, thereby reducing costs. Last spring, the Hebei and Pingyuan provincial cooperatives transported grain from Tianjin according to plan to areas close to consumers, reducing the number of circulation levels and saving a lot of freight and reducing commodity costs. For example, the commodities allocated by the National General Cooperative to the lower-level cooperatives are directly sent to the county cooperative warehouses or the wholesale stations set up in cooperation with the provincial cooperatives according to the plan, and the county cooperatives distribute them to the villages according to the plans of the grassroots cooperatives, and then distribute them to the members according to the quantity. This statistical distribution method is a progressive system in the supply work of cooperatives and should be conscientiously implemented and promoted.
    The second is to carefully store goods. The storage of goods has a great relationship with the development of supply work. Among the leading cadres of many cooperatives, the storage of cash is more important than the storage of goods, which has caused losses due to neglecting the storage of goods. To overcome this shortcoming, the first thing is that the leading cadres should attach importance to this work ideologically, and appoint special personnel to regularly check the fire prevention, rain prevention, and anti-theft equipment in the warehouse, the storage date of the goods, and the technical storage methods. The storage personnel must study the nature, characteristics, shelf life, and moisture content of each commodity, and check them in rotation to identify the goods, pay attention to insect eating and rat bites, sun and wind, and ensure that the goods do not deteriorate.
    The third is to promote democracy and stipulate the quota profits of cooperatives at all levels in order to widely absorb the opinions of members, improve the funding of supply work, and give members more benefits. In the distribution of profits, in the past, the regional difference in the purchase of goods from afar or the benefits of processing orders were mostly exclusive to the upper-level cooperatives; the goods arrived in the hands of the members, some were slightly lower, and some were equal to the market price. This does not conform to the spirit of "buying consumer goods and production materials at cheap prices" and "making members truly get material benefits," and has increased some difficulties in the supply work and affected the relationship between members and cooperatives. If the principle of "less at the top and more at the bottom" can be adopted to determine the quota profits of cooperatives at all levels, it will be of great help to the development of supply work.
  Shortcomings in the Marketing Business of Cooperatives and Methods for Improvement
    The marketing business of cooperatives is as important as the supply business. In rural areas where land reform is completed and the large-scale production movement is launched, the urgent demand of farmers (members) is to quickly sell their agricultural and sideline products at reasonable prices in order to invest in agricultural production or exchange them for daily necessities. Strengthening the marketing of agricultural and sideline products by cooperatives at all levels has become a major task at present. Because only by finding a market for the members' products and increasing their purchasing power can the agricultural production increase plan be realized, the life can be improved, and the market for industrial products can be consolidated and expanded. This is the key to enlivening urban and rural trade.
    At present, there are some problems in the marketing business of cooperatives. Cooperatives at all levels have made great achievements in marketing native products, but many shortcomings have also occurred. The first is blind acquisition, regardless of sales. Simply starting from meeting the temporary requirements of a few members, ignoring the greater interests of the majority of members, forming a one-sided mass viewpoint in the procurement work. For example, some special and county cooperatives blindly acquire anemarrhena, cork, and mountain goods, etc., regardless of sales, and cannot sell them for a long time, holding up funds and unable to continue serving the members. Some special zone cooperatives collected saltpeter and blindly transported it to the Northeast, and could not sell it after storing it for a year. Similar blind operation is relatively common. The second is to engage in marketing starting from profit, not from solving more problems for the members. For example, some provincial cooperatives sell medicinal materials in Tianjin. When there is a market, they do not sell because they are waiting for the market and want to wait for the price to rise. Later, the price falls and they cannot sell, which affects the marketing task. When some cooperatives exchange native products with friendly zones, they strive for high prices to make more money, which affects the rapid marketing. The third is the lack of management skills and basic commercial knowledge, resulting in losses of materials. For example, some cooperatives transport sulfur without packaging, resulting in great losses; some use coal trucks to transport pork, which turns black after being transported. These blind marketing phenomena seriously hinder the progress of the marketing business of cooperatives and affect the marketing of agricultural and sideline products and native products of the members.
    How to carry out the marketing business? The first is to "determine purchases based on sales" under the spirit of actively marketing native products and finding new markets for them. Correctly grasp the situation of the members' native products, find a good sales market, and then purchase them. Rural grassroots cooperatives should compile statistics on the types, quantities, qualities, and specifications of agricultural and sideline products and native products to be sold by members by season or year, and report them to the county cooperative. For native products that are locally regulated, the county cooperative will uniformly find sales markets, sign contracts, and then organize grassroots cooperatives to directly deliver goods according to the contract. If the county cooperative cannot sell them, it will report to the provincial cooperative. After the provincial cooperative finds a good sales market and signs a contract, it will organize the county cooperative to directly deliver goods. If the provincial cooperative cannot solve it, it will report to the higher-level cooperative to find a sales market and sign a contract, and then arrange purchases according to the contract and deliver goods on a regular basis. This bottom-up statistics and sales-based purchase method is an effective way to overcome blind operation. At the same time, it can avoid detours in the goods and reduce the number of circulation levels, thereby reducing circulation costs. The second is to hold "entrusted sales." After the native products are found in the market, the members will first take out the native products, sign a contract, write a guarantee, and pay for the goods after the native products are sold. If there is a surplus, a part can be returned. Or implement consignment sales, after the goods are sold, pay in batches according to the quantity, and the cooperative draws a certain handling fee. This method saves funds and can sell native products. It is one of the effective ways to develop the marketing business. In the trial implementation of this method by cooperatives at all levels, they should ensure credit, and make public the profits and losses to the members. The third is to process, rectify, and formulate trademarks according to the needs of domestic and foreign markets, so that the commodities are standardized, so as to consolidate and expand the market. For example, grass mats, sulfur, medicinal materials, pockets, soybean oil, and mountain goods, etc., after processing, unify the quality, fix the standard, and indicate the trademark, gradually open the market and expand sales. The native cloth in Hebei Province has basically solved the sales problem by adopting this method. Some cooperatives transported cool mats to Tianjin, which were not easy to sell. After the merchants bought them and processed, rectified, and printed trademarks on them, not only did the price increase, but they were also easy to sell.
    In addition, close contact with friendly zone cooperatives and public and private enterprises, widely opening up sales markets, adopting methods such as "exchange purchases, pre-purchases, credit purchases, joint operations," and organizing transportation and establishing warehouses have a certain relationship with the development of marketing work.

　　合作社的供应与推销业务
    周钧
    转变“供销一揽子”的经营方法
    一年来的合作社经济，由于各级人民政府的扶助及国营经济的支持，在全国范围内，有着巨大的发展，截至去年九月底止，已有社员二千五百万人。这种巨大的群众经济组织，正在不断地发展、扩大。经过整社，逐渐肃清各级社的资本主义经营思想，改变了作法，贯彻了上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务的方针。特别是今后推行配售制、使合作社纳入正规后，社员对合作社的关系将更密切。他们的经济生活中的主要部分——农副产品的推销及生产资料、日用必需品的供给，也就依靠合作社全部或大部来解决。这样一来，合作社经营的商品增加了，任务也繁重了。为了完成社员所交付的任务，作到廉价而应时地供应社员生产资料及生活必需品，合理地迅速地推销农副产品，以满足社员的经济生活，必须有一个新的适应任务的业务经营方法。如在业务上仍实行“综合经营”“供销一揽子”的形式，是不能应付业务日益复杂化的局面的。为了适应这种发展，并吸取苏联的经验，将过去的综合业务，分为供应与推销分别经营的方法，是十分必要的。所谓供应业务就是自上而下地供给社员生产资料与日用必需品。而推销业务就是将农民（社员）所生产的农副产品、原料，自下而上地组织销售。
    供应和推销业务分开经营有什么好处呢？由于推销与供给设有专门机构，就能够根据社员的要求，分别负责研究、计划，施行分别使用资金，不仅使社员的农副产品得以迅速地以合理的比价推销，生活和生产资料廉价而及时地供给，切实地满足社员要求，而且在代替国家收购土产、原料时也容易完成。“供销一揽子”经营所产生的盲目供销、积压资金，供销不协调，彼此不照顾等现象，自可避免。此外，供应、推销的分开，对实行经济核算，合理经营，也创造了便利的条件。如有的合作社共有资金十三亿元，收购社员棉花即占去十一亿元，社员要求生产和生活资料，就不能解决，这就大大影响了对社员的供给业务。反之，即可合理地分别使用资金，满足社员的要求。
    根据东北各省社这一时期的体验，认为供应、推销分开后，业务范围较前清楚，便于经营，逐渐转变了过去业务上的紊乱现象；对于下层社的业务情况及材料，也容易掌握了。
  合作社供应业务中的缺点和改进的方法
    合作社供应业务的任务，不仅是有计划地供给社员生产和生活资料，以及把工农业产品廉价而及时地供给到消费者、生产者（社员）手中，而且更积极的是，刺激生产，影响生产，根据消费者的需要而生产，达到生产计划化。同时，联结个体的消费者，变自由市场为有组织的市场，使城市与农村之间，县与县之间，省与省之间，广泛地开展合作社内部的商业，建立纵横的合作社贸易网，以便有力地配合国家经济建设的重大任务。
    合作社企业，虽然在一年来有了很大的发展，并在生产救灾、组织城乡贸易上，起了一定的作用；但在供应业务上，还存在着严重的缺点，如追逐市场，盲目经营，不从社员需要出发，只从干部喜爱着想，不按季节经营等，因而发生了有的社经营煤炭，不从社员需要出发，而从产地和销地的差价大小着眼，在矿厂订煤，供给自由市场。有的社盲目的订购绒衣，结果下级社需要不多，积压了千余件，几个月销不出去。有的农村社到上海采购大批消费品如刀片、刀架、饭盒、女拉链鞋、高跟鞋、跳舞袜子、小孩尿布等，因不适合农民需要，只有运津转售。有的社却在立秋后运来凉席，因已过季节，长期存放。也有用麻袋装运雨伞，磨掉油漆，难于出售。这样，就严重地障碍了合作社的正轨发展和经营合理化。
    合作社的供应业务应该怎样做呢？应该是变盲目经营为计划供给。去年若干合作社在贸易工作上曾有凭估计定计划，根据全省总人口需用商品数，计划供给若干，或是见到当地商人采购某一种商品，而合作社也去追随采办的盲目经营现象，转变这一作法，首要是：加强基层社的调查统计工作。这是计划供给的关键。基层社要利用社员代表会或社员小组会，调查每个社员每月每个季节（如播种季节、春节、中秋节等）或全年的实际需要的生产资料及日用必需品的种类、数量、牌号、规格、到货日期等。基层社加以综合统计，在本身力所能及、产地临近的情形下，可以组织“联购”“赊购”。例如社员需要食油、肥料等，在附近即有油厂，基层社即可组织社员，预付货款，购回分配；或与油厂订好合同或协议，先取货，货到现分，凑款还账。这种办法，既省资金，又可迅速解决社员的要求。另外如地方性的商品，基层社可以自行采办供给。在基层社无力供给的商品，按月按季或按节令，制订计划（包括商品种类、牌号、当地市价、交货日期等）交县联社解决。县联合社接到全县基层社的零售计划后，综合统计，亦根据以上办法，予以解决。县不能解决的交省，省及大行政区联社不能供给的部分，交由全国总社解决。这样自下而上地制出零售计划，再由上而下地按质按量按计划供给，再辅之以“逐级定货制”，盲目经营自可避免。
    合作社在施行计划经营的同时还要注意商品的运输、保管、成本等问题。第一是直线送达商品，降低运输成本。为要作到廉价供给，给社员以物质实惠，即须实行直线供给，减少商品的流通过程中不必要的环节，使商品从生产场所直接送达消费者面前，从而降低成本。去年春季，河北、平原省社运粮，从天津按计划分运到接近消费者地区，减少了流转层次，节省了大量的运费，减低了商品成本。如全国总社拨给下级社的商品，协同省社按计划直发县社仓库，或发所设批发站，县社按基层社计划分发各村，然后按量对社员进行分配。这种统计分配的方法，是合作社供应工作中进步的制度，应认真贯彻推广。
    其次是认真保管商品。商品的保管对供应工作的开展关系很大。在许多合作社的领导干部中，对现金的保管重于商品的保管，因而造成因轻视商品保管而蒙受损失的现象。克服这一缺点，首要是领导干部应从思想上重视这一工作，指定专人经常检查仓库的防火、防雨、防盗设备，商品存放日期，保管技术方法等。保管人员则必须钻研每种商品的性质、特点、保存期、含潮量，轮流抽查，鉴别货色，注意虫吃鼠咬，日晒风吹，保证商品不变质。
    第三是发扬民主，规定各级社的定额利润，以达到广泛吸取社员意见，改进供应工作经费和较多的给社员以利益。在利润的分配上，过去有些地区的合作社远途采购商品的地区差额，或加工定货的好处，大部归上级社独有；商品到社员手中，有的稍低一点，有的与市价相等。这是不符合“廉价的买到消费品和生产资料”，“使社员真正得到物质的实惠”的精神，并使供应工作增加了若干困难，以及影响到社员与合作社的关系。如能采取“上少下多”的原则，确定各级社的定额利润，对供应工作的开展有很大的帮助。
  合作社推销业务中的缺点和改进的方法
    合作社的推销业务，和供应业务是同等重要的。在完成土地改革、开展大生产运动的农村中，农民（社员）的迫切要求，是将自己的农副产品迅速地以合理比价推销出去，以便投资于农业生产，或换回生活必需品。各级社加强农副产品的推销，就成了目前的重大任务。因为只有给社员将产品找到销路，提高其购买力，农业增产计划才能实现，生活才能改善，工业品的市场才能巩固与扩大。这是活跃城乡贸易的关键。
    目前合作社在推销业务上是存在有若干问题的。各级社推销土产是有很大成绩，但也发生了许多缺点。首先是不问销路如何，盲目收购。单纯从满足少数社员临时的要求出发，忽视多数社员更大的利益，形成采购工作上的片面的群众观点。如有的专、县社，不管销路，盲目收购知母、黄柏及山货等，长期卖不掉、压住资金，不能继续为社员服务。有的专区社，收了火硝、盲目运往东北，存了一年销不出去。类似这样盲目经营，是较为普遍的。其次是搞推销从盈利出发，不是从多给社员解决问题着想。如有的省社在津推销药材，有销路时，因等行市和妄想等待价涨不卖，后来落价卖不出去，影响推销任务。有的社以土产与友区交换时，力争高价多赚钱，影响了迅速推销。再次是缺乏经营技术及起码的商业知识，致使物资受到损失。如有的社运硫磺不包装，损失很大；有的用煤车装猪肉，运到后已变成黑肉。这些盲目推销的现象，严重地妨碍了合作社推销业务的进行，影响了社员农副产品、土产品的推销。
    如何开展推销业务呢？第一是在积极推销土产品，为其寻找新的市场精神下，“以销定购”。正确地掌握社员土产情况，找好销路，再行收购。农村基层社按季节或年度分别统计社员要出售的农、副产品、土产品的种类、数量、质量、规格，报告县社。属于地方性调剂的土产，县社统一找销路，订合同，再组织基层社按合同直接交货。县社不能推销的，汇报省社，省社找好销路、订立合同后，再组织县社直接交货。省社不能解决的，报请上级社找销路、订合同，然后按合同布置收购，定期交货。这种自下而上的统计，按销定购的作法，是克服盲目经营的有效办法。同时可以避免商品走弯路，减少了流转层次，从而减低流转费用。第二是举办“委托推销”。土产找到市场后，先由社员拿出土产，订好契约，写下保证，卖出土产再付货款。如有盈余，还可返还一部。或者实行代销，货物卖出后，按数量分批付款，合作社抽一定的手续费。这种办法，既省资金，又能把土产推销出去。是开展推销业务的有效办法之一。各级社在试行这一办法中，应作到保证信用，盈亏开支向社员公开。第三是根据国内外市场需要，进行加工、整庄、制定商标，使商品规格化，以巩固与扩大市场。如草席、硫磺、药材、口袋、豆油、山货等，经过加工，统一质量，固定标准注明商标，逐渐打开市场，扩大销路。河北省的土布，采取这种办法，基本上解决了销路问题。有的社运津凉席不好销，商人买去加工、整庄印上商标后，不仅价格提高，同时也便于销售。
    此外，密切与友区社及公私企业联系，广泛地开辟销路，采用“换购、预购、赊购、联营”等办法及组织运输、建立堆栈等，都与推销工作的开展有着一定的关系。
