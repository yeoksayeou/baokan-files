　　People from All Circles in Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, Extend Spring Festival Greetings to Families of Heroes
Editor:
    During the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, the family of Comrade Liu Sihu, the famous national combat hero, received cordial greetings from people from all circles in Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province.
    On February 4th, the hero's home was as lively as if a grand celebration were taking place. The comfort team and Yangko team organized by the people of Fengzhen County, led by District Chief Qin, carrying red flags and beating drums and gongs, presented flowers, flags, and gifts of sympathy to the hero's mother, Old Lady Liu, and the hero's fiancée, and hung the glorious plaque of "Home of a Hero" at his home.
    The hero Liu Sihu's fifty-six-year-old mother and young fiancée, wearing brand-new clothes and large red flowers pinned to their chests, felt boundless glory and pride that their son and loved one had become heroes defending the motherland. They both welcomed the comfort team with smiles on their faces. Old Lady Liu also told everyone that she would definitely write to her son, telling him about the preferential treatment the family had received from the government and the people, and encouraging him to make more contributions and resolutely defend our great motherland.
    The people love the people's heroes. The hero's mother, Old Lady Liu, has always been cared for and respected by the local government and people from all walks of life. Every year during important festivals, the local people automatically extend greetings and pay tribute to this glorious old woman; the government also regularly provides preferential grain and helps her solve life's difficulties in a timely manner. The wise Old Lady Liu is also a skilled worker, and she often does needlework for others. In 1950 alone, she made more than twenty pairs of shoes and sewed more than ten leather jackets.

　　绥远丰镇县各界人民春节慰问英雄家属
    编辑同志：
    在春节拥军优属运动中，著名的全国战斗英雄刘四虎同志的家属，受到了绥远省丰镇县各界人民的亲切慰问。
    二月四日这一天，英雄的家里像办大喜事一样热闹。丰镇县各界人民所组织的慰问队、秧歌队、打着红旗、敲着锣鼓，在秦区长领导下，向英雄的母亲刘老大娘及英雄的未婚妻献花、献旗、献慰问品，并在他家挂起了“英雄之家”的光荣匾。
    英雄刘四虎的五十六岁的母亲和年青的未婚妻，身上穿着崭新的衣服，胸前挂着大朵红花，为自己儿子、爱人成了保卫祖国的英雄而感到无限的光荣和骄傲。她们娘俩个满脸带笑地欢迎着慰问队。刘老大娘并且向大家表示：她一定给儿子去信，告诉家里受到政府和人民优待的情形，鼓励儿子更多地立功，坚决捍卫我们伟大的祖国。
    人民的英雄人人爱。英雄的母亲刘老太太一向受着当地政府及各界人民的关怀与敬爱。每年各重要的节日，当地人民都自动向这位光荣老人慰问、致敬；政府平时亦发给优待粮，及时帮助她解决生活困难。贤明的刘老太太并且是一个劳动能手，她经常替人做针线活。在一九五○年一年内她就做了二十余双鞋子，缝了皮袄十多件。
