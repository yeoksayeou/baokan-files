　　New Discoveries in Soviet Biological Science
　　——The Theory of "Living Matter"
　　Ao·Bo·Le baixinsijiaya
　　Editor's Note: Soviet biologist Professor Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has made important discoveries regarding the origin of cells. This article provides a popular explanation of Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's new discoveries and their significance for biology and science as a whole. The author, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya, is a researcher in the cytology laboratory led by Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya.
    It is well known that at the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences conference in August 1948, the reactionary idealist essence of the genetic "theories" of formal geneticists was exposed, and the advanced Michurin doctrine achieved victory. Michurin biology raised some questions about the development of organisms in a new way.
    However, until recently, biology still retained large areas where idealist and mechanistic theories nested. The science of cells (cytology) is such an area.
    The discovery of the cell as one of the basic organizational forms of living matter (живая материя) was one of the greatest discoveries in biology in the first half of the last century, and one of the factors that triggered a revolution in natural science. Schleiden and Schwann are considered the founders of cell theory, and they were the first to establish the doctrine of cells on a scientific basis. In the 1830s, Schleiden and Schwann used the method of "in vivo observation" (метод ПрижизненнЫх набпюдениЙ) to create a theory that cells developed from non-cellular, unstructured masses. However, due to the underdeveloped research techniques at that time, they were unable to consolidate their views on cell formation, and by the second half of the nineteenth century, Schleiden and Schwann's theories were completely strangled by the scientifically and politically reactionary cell theory of the German scholar Virchow.
    Virchow's "theory" argued that cells can only be formed from cells by division, that the cell is the only and simplest unit of life, and that there is nothing alive outside the cell. The problem was posed so mechanically that the organism was seen as a simple sum of cells, and therefore, all normal physiological processes and pathological changes in the organism were explained as changes occurring only within the cells themselves.
    Virchow's "theory" is a collection of metaphysical and reactionary dogmas. It has dominated biology and medicine for a hundred years and has long hindered the scientific solution of the most important biological problems. It hindered the exploration of issues related to the evolution of living matter and the forms that living matter possessed in the pre-cellular state. This theory completely disregarded the issue of the development of "living matter" (живое вешество), that is, the origin of life on Earth. Virchow limited biological research to the cell, and they did not examine living matter at this stage of development: when living matter only had a slight degree of specialization, and thus, it was very possible to find the general laws of biology and discover a way for one kind of living matter to change into another. Virchow's theory greatly limited the possibility of research in the fields of biology and medicine. It not only had a detrimental effect on the development of cell theory, but also became the foundation for the reactionary theories of formal geneticists Weismann, Mendel, Morgan, and their supporters.
    Virchow's cell "theory" is in complete contradiction with the basic tenets of Marx and Lenin's theory on the development process of all natural phenomena, and Soviet scholars have subjected it to relentless criticism. Soviet biologist Professor Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has made a great contribution in exposing this pseudo-scientific theory.
    Since 1933, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has been stubbornly studying the problem of the origin and development of cells. She has staunchly defended and adhered to principled scientific viewpoints, resisting the attacks of modern biologists who have not yet abandoned Virchow's principles.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's many years of work have achieved great results. She has proven the fallacy of Virchow's dogma with irrefutable experimental evidence. These research results have been described by Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya in her scientific masterpiece "The Origin of Cells from Living Matter and the Role of Living Matter in the Organism." The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union awarded Professor Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya the First Class Stalin Prize for this work.
    In her scientific writings, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya proved that Virchow's dogmas: "cells can only be produced from cells," "the organism is the sum of cells," and "there is no life outside the cell" – are all untenable. She established cell theory on a truly materialistic foundation, and opened up completely new prospects for the creative thinking of scholars in the field of medicine and in the field of biology – the science of life.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has conducted experimental research on the origin and development of cells on various biological materials. She studied the initial stages of development of several types of higher animals, studied adult individuals of animals with simpler tissues, and the recovery process in organism tissues.
    When studying the age changes (возрастнЫе изменения) of the cell membrane, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya discovered in the blood of tadpoles the entire picture of various transitional stages from yolk spheres without cell structure to true blood cells. This observation suggested to her a hypothesis, that is, that cells do not necessarily have to be produced only by division from similar mother cells, but can also develop from living matter of a lower level of organization and without cell structure, in this case, from the so-called yolk spheres, which were previously only considered nutrients in the development of the organism.
    In order to confirm this hypothesis, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya applied the latest achievements of scientific experimental technology to conduct many research studies on various objects where she assumed the existence of "living matter," that is, a substance without cell structure but containing protein and capable of metabolism and development. Eggs, fish roe, and frog eggs were her initial research objects.
    Prior to these studies, scholars believed that the protein and yolk surrounding the embryonic cells in the egg were merely stored nutrients required by the embryo and did not possess any vital characteristics. When studying the development of bird eggs, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya focused her attention on the yolk, because in the blood of tadpoles, transitional forms from yolk spheres to blood cells had been discovered.
    Observations of the development of yolk spheres at different stages of chicken egg development began with the study of yolk masses in the subgerminal cavity filled with liquid. In these yolk spheres, no traces of nuclear substance (ядерное вещество) possessed by any normal cell were seen.
    As the chicken embryo developed under incubator conditions, regularly repeating changes were found in similar yolk spheres. In the center of the yolk sphere, a space filled with fine particles appeared. The center of this particle was figuratively called the "protoplasmic nucleus." During further artificial incubation of the chicken embryo, a homogeneous vesicle appeared in place of the "protoplasmic nucleus," with ray-like filaments radiating around it. Under high magnification, it can be found that these filaments are composed of many tiny protoplasmic particles, which sometimes fuse together. After special treatment of this sphere, it can be seen that there is no true nucleus inside. However, at the next stage of development, the central body will transform into a true, clearly visible nucleus. Thus, we have the structure of a true cell. And finally, with further artificial incubation, we see spheres undergoing various stages of "indirect division," which is unique to the cells of complex organisms.
    All these pictures of the development of cells from yolk spheres were observed on serial sections of chicken egg specimens, which were stained to reveal the structures when cells were unformed and when cells were formed. In addition, this process of cell development from yolk spheres was also observed in another way, namely, by the "culture method," that is, by studying in an artificial environment outside the embryo. At the same time, with the help of a micro-cinematography camera, the developmental process of "spherical cells" was recorded.
    At the very beginning of the yolk sphere culture, they are scattered throughout the field of view, extremely uniform and similar, and sparkling. After two hours, they become opaque and granular. In many spheres, the particles make irregular, so-called "Brownian" motion. Sometimes amoeboid movement is seen in these spheres. Simultaneously with amoeboid movement, particles also move in the spheres, concentrating towards the center and scattering into rays around a forming, bright vesicle. After a series of developmental stages, a young cell is formed, and finally, it becomes a cell capable of indirect division.
    Whether observed in vivo by the culture method or observed from prepared specimen materials, the pictures are the same, which is the best verification for the same phenomenon discovered by various research methods.
    The next fate of the newly formed cells has also been investigated. Initially, there is still some distance between them, but later, they approach each other to form normal "embryonic leaflets," thereby forming the embryo. The yolk spheres distributed between the two embryonic leaflets and therefore in different situations develop differently. They do not form individual cells, but become entire cell masses, which are "blood islands" (КровяноЙ Островок). "Blood islands" then develop into blood-filled blood vessels. This process has also been studied for yolk spheres in culture. In such cultures, blood islands at various stages of development can be observed after one day. When studying the development of yolk spheres attached to the blood vessel wall, it has been observed that the particles in the spheres become larger and larger from the periphery to the center of the sphere. Obviously, as more and more hemoglobin accumulates, the yolk spheres begin to turn red. Cells grown from large particles appear in the most mature yolk spheres, which have become very large and gradually approach the color of blood, much like nascent red blood cells. These cells permeate into the blood vessels and flow along these blood vessels in the plasma as normal red blood cells.
    After these experiments, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya engaged in the study of the initial stages of egg cell development, the so-called egg cell, which is the cell from which an entire complex organism will later develop. She took artificially fertilized sturgeon (Севрюга) roe for observation. Originally, the egg cells of sturgeon and several other animals go through a stage without a nucleus in their development. Observations of such cells showed that these egg cells also go through the same stages as cells grown from yolk spheres.
    All these experiments prove that cells can be formed from some kind of simpler structure without cell structure.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya was not satisfied with this. She decided to study the development of living matter and the process of its constitutive morphology in living protoplasm, which is separated from the cells of the organism. For this, she chose the most appropriate research material, the "hydra," a creature that is on the one hand at a very low stage of development, and on the other hand, has a very strong regenerative power.
    In order to study living matter, hydras were mechanically destroyed until the individual cells were destroyed. The living matter extracted from the cells was then subjected to a fine operation to remove the possibility of any cells that had not yet been destroyed or individual parts thereof falling into the culture medium. In this way, when the culture was raised, the field of view revealed under the microscope was very clear in the culture medium. But after only one hour, many pinhead-sized spots appeared in the field of view, which gradually grew into many round protein spheres. These things have no significant internal structure. These are the so-called "colloidal condensates" (Коа церватЫ). When stained with methylene blue, the "colloidal condensates" behave like living material: that is, in their normal state, they are not stained, and they can only be stained when dried. In an environment without "nutrients," under unsuitable conditions, the development of colloidal condensates is very poor. They die without reaching maturity. However, the situation is completely different when some nutrients are added to it. These nutrients are extracted from copepods, which hydras feed on in their natural environment. In this environment, colloidal condensates develop into cells after one day. Before dividing, the cells appear very active, and further, due to continuous reproduction, they become a sphere stage (morula) composed of thirty to thirty-five cells. All the above processes were also photographed by a micro-cinematography camera.
    These observations made Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya consider a very important question, which has great practical significance for medicine, that is, the question of cell regeneration and the role of living matter in the process of wound healing. In any trauma, not only is the integrity of the tissue destroyed, but the integrity of the cells themselves is also destroyed. Living matter is separated from them, just as living matter is separated when the cells of the hydra are destroyed. In the study of wound healing, the close relationship between bleeding and the speed of wound healing has been determined: the living matter formed in the bleeding part is the original material for the development of new cells.
    Based on these observations, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya proposed the use of blood to treat wounds in 1940.
    In recent years, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has expanded and deepened the research on the problem of cell generation from living matter and the research on living matter itself.
    Researchers at Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's laboratory also discovered in 1945, when studying living matter, a capability of living matter, that is, to interact with various chemical substances to produce synthetic crystals, which they called biocrystals (БиокристаппЫ). These biocrystals are an intermediate form between true crystals and organisms. They may be a transitional stage from cells to crystals, or vice versa, from crystals to cells. The researchers in the laboratory have achieved the transition from cells to crystals. They not only crystallized bacteria, but also crystallized the entire organisms of ciliates.
    In the work of forming cells from bird egg proteins, the researchers in the laboratory also pointed out the regular process of forming cells from crystalline corpuscles, that is, biocrystals. They understood the entire development process from the generation of biocrystals in proteins to the completion of cells capable of dividing. With further development, these cells become complex, morula-like spheres, becoming a whole mass of cells.
    In the process of cell formation from proteins, the developing chicken eggs not only showed morphological changes in structure, but also discovered complex changes and development in the chemical properties of living matter. For example, in the various stages of unformed cells, nucleic acids appear and accumulate in biological structures, and the existence of nucleic acids is a characteristic of cell components that can metabolize.
    Engels said: "Life is a form of existence of protein bodies."
    Everything that happens within the biological development of living matter itself also happens basically in proteins, because protein is the main component of living matter. In addition to proteins, many other substances also participate in this development process, the most important of which are nucleic acids. Everyone knows that nucleic acids are related to the processes of cell growth and division.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya has repeatedly confirmed in her many experiments that nucleic acids have a huge effect on the development and life activities of living matter. For example, she pointed out the fixed regularity in the development of colloidal condensates. Only those colloidal condensates in which nucleic acids can be found grow and develop. However, their specific role in biological processes is still an unresolved issue.
    In the next step, when researchers in the laboratory studied the phenomena that occur when proteins and nucleic acids interact, they discovered that nucleic acid molecules straighten out curled protein molecules. This phenomenon cannot but affect the strengthening of metabolism and the ability to produce new protein molecules (synthetic proteins) in living matter. In addition, it was also found that when nucleic acids accumulate to a sufficient amount in homogeneous, unstructured living matter, the process of structure formation can be observed, that is, the process of forming the nucleus, chromosomes, cell membrane, etc. from living matter. It seems that when living matter develops into cells, there must be an accumulation of nucleic acids, and the accumulation of nucleic acids promotes metabolism, produces synthetic proteins, and produces the structure of cells.
    The work of the researchers in the cytology laboratory on the development of single-celled organisms is also of great interest. Their research has confirmed Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's conclusion that life does not begin with cells, but begins with living matter of a lower level of organization than cell structure, and this living matter is "living matter." They have proven with a large amount of material that amoebas and ciliates not only reproduce by division, but also by throwing out tiny particles, and each tiny particle develops into a new individual. This unique method of reproduction is interesting because it explains why protozoa reproduce so quickly. This high-speed reproduction can be observed under certain conditions, especially when metabolites accumulate in the culture.
    Many experiments in the cytology laboratory have proven that the cells of complex organisms can also reproduce in a similar way. These works are pursuing the cause of the sudden and rapid occurrence of new growths in the organism, such as the problem of malignant tumors, from another perspective.
    Researchers in the laboratory also discovered the following phenomenon: under the influence of external environmental changes, amoebas will throw out offspring in various stages of development from their bodies. These offspring repeat the old morphology of the parent amoeba and all develop into grown amoebas. In this way, because it is possible to obtain more primitive forms, we can transform certain types of protozoa into other types under changing external conditions, and realize the variation of lower biological types artificially under the observation of researchers.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya refuted Virchow's basic thesis, that cells are only produced by cells and that there is no life outside the cell, with her many studies. Therefore, it is natural that she also refuted his dogma that the organism is the sum of cells. She proved that development does not begin with cells, but begins with tissues of simpler cell-free structures than cells. In individual development, the organism not only repeats the cell stage of living matter development in terms of species variation morphology, but also repeats the stage when living matter still remains in the pre-cell development period. She proved that cells are not only produced by cell division, but also by the regeneration of living matter. The organism is not the sum of many cells, but a complex system composed not only of cells, but also of living matter. The organism is a unified whole, in which the parts fully obey the whole, and at the same time, the whole also obeys the parts, and finally, they both obey the external environment.
    In this way, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's research work refutes Virchow's old mechanistic cell theory and replaces it with a new, truly materialistic cell theory. The morphology of cells is no longer recognized as an immutable, fixed, homogeneous type of living matter, following a neat chain in a continuous series of generations. They are relatively stable forms of living matter organized in cells, but when the environment changes, such cells cease to exist. They decompose into many extremely small, viable particles, which can re-develop into cells under suitable conditions. Movement, variation, and the mutual restraint of phenomena in living matter are important principles that biological processes follow. In this way, Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's work has enriched science with many new facts about the origin and development of life.
    The achievements of Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's labor are of great significance to many departments of biology and medicine. Her research work enables us to solve the problems of the occurrence and development of malignant tumors, the regeneration of body elements, and the recovery of organs more smoothly, as well as fight against many kinds of diseases.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's works enrich the natural historical foundation of the materialistic world view. They are of particularly great significance for deepening the dialectical materialistic viewpoint on the morphological development of organisms.
    Just as the bourgeois pseudo-science is busy making vicious plans to destroy hundreds of millions of people and is busy preparing for atomic and germ warfare, Soviet scholars are studying the solemn process of life development and delving into the issue of how science can actively intervene in natural development.
    Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya's discovery is an eloquent proof of the powerful surge of Soviet science, which, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great scientific master Comrade Stalin, is contributing all its strength to increasing the happiness of the Soviet people and building communism in the Soviet Union.

　　苏联生物科学的新发现
　  ——关于“活质”的学说
　　奥·波·勒柏辛斯卡娅
    编者按：苏联生物学家奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在细胞起源问题上有重要的发现。这一篇文章通俗地解说了奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅这个新发现及其对于生物学以及整个科学的意义。作者奥·波·勒柏辛斯卡娅是奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅所主持的细胞学实验室里的一位研究员。
    大家都知道，在一九四八年八月全苏列宁农业科学院的会议上，曾经揭穿了形式遗传学者们的遗传“理论”之反动唯心本质，先进的米丘林学说获得了胜利。米丘林生物学以新的方式提出了有机体发展的一些问题。
    但是直到最近，在生物学中，仍还保留着大块大块的地方，由那些唯心论的和机械论的理论营巢筑穴。关于细胞的科学（细胞学）就是这样的一块地方。
    作为有生命物质（живая　материя）基本组织形态之一的细胞的发现，乃是上世纪前半纪生物学上最伟大的一个发现，乃是促成自然科学革命的因素之一。施莱登和施旺被称作是细胞理论的创始者，他们最早把关于细胞的学说建立在科学基础之上。在上一世纪的三十年代，施莱登和施旺使用活时观察法（метод　ПрижизненнЫх　набпюдениЙ），创造了细胞是由非细胞的、无结构的块体发展而来的理论。但是，由于那时候研究的技术尚不发达，他们就没有能够巩固自己的对于细胞形成的观点，而到十九世纪后半纪，施莱登和施旺的学说就完全被科学上和政治上的反动派，德国学者微耳和的细胞理论所绞杀了。
    微耳和的“理论”，主张细胞只能以分裂的方法由细胞形成，细胞是唯一的、最简单的生命单位，在细胞以外没有任何活的东西。问题被如此机械地提出，结果有机体就被看成了细胞的简单总和，从而，有机体中一切正常的生理过程和病理变化，就被解释成为只是细胞本身内发生的变化了。
    微耳和的“理论”是形而上学的反动的教条的总和，它在生物学中和医学中统治了一百年，曾经长久地阻滞着最重要的生物学问题的科学解决。它妨碍了探讨那些与研究有生命物质的进化有关的问题，以及有生命物质在前细胞状况中具有的那些形态。这一理论将“活质”（живое　вешество）发展的问题，也就是地球上生命起源的问题，全然置之不顾。微耳和将生物学的研究，局限于细胞这一点上，他们就没有考察在这样发展阶段上的有生命物质，这就是：当有生命物质只有轻微程度的特殊化，从而，非常可能找到一般生物的规律性和发见一种有生命物质改变为另外一种的道路的时候。微耳和的理论非常限制在生物学和医学领域内作研究的可能性，它不仅给与细胞学说的发展以有害的影响，而且成为形式遗传学者魏斯曼、孟德尔、摩尔根以及他们的拥护者们的反动学说的基础了。
    微耳和的细胞“学说”，是和马克思、列宁关于一切自然现象发展过程的学说的基本论题完全抵触的，苏维埃学者们曾予以无情的批评。苏维埃生物学者奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅教授在揭露这一伪科学的学说上，有着伟大的功劳。
    从一九三三年起，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅就开始倔强地研究细胞的起源与发展的问题了，她坚强地保卫着和固守着科学的原则性的观点，抵抗那些尚未放弃微耳和原理的现代生物学者们的攻击。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅许多年来的工作获得了巨大的成绩，她以不容置辩的实验的证据，证明了微耳和教条的谬误，这些研究结果，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅已叙述在她的科学巨著《细胞起源于活质及活质在有机体内的作用》一书中。苏联部长会议为这一著述授与奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅教授一级斯大林奖金。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在自己的科学著述中，证明了微耳和的教条：“细胞只能从细胞产生”，“有机体是细胞的总和”，“细胞以外没有生命”——都是不能成立的。她把细胞学说建立到真正唯物论的基础之上，而为医学的领域中以及关于生命的科学——生物学的领域中的学者们的创造性思想，打开了全新的前途。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅曾在各种不同的生物材料上进行关于细胞的起源和发展问题的实验研究。她研究了若干种高等动物发育的最初阶段，研究了组织比较简单的动物成龄个体和有机体组织中的恢复过程。
    在研究细胞膜的年龄变化（возрастнЫе　изменения），时奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在蝌蚪的血液中发现了从没有细胞结构的卵黄球，到真正血球之间各过渡阶段的全貌。这种观察暗示给她一种假设，这就是说，细胞并不一定只能由同类的母细胞以分裂的方法产生，而是还可以由组织更低级的、没有细胞结构的有生命物质发展成，在这个场合下，就是由所谓卵黄球发展成，这些卵黄球的形成体，过去只认为是有机体发育中的一种养料。
    为了证实这一假说，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅应用科学实验技术的最新成就，在各种各样她假定存在有“活质”的对象上，进行了许多研究的工作，而所谓“活质”，这就是一种没有细胞结构而其构成中有蛋白质并能够新陈代谢和发展的物质。鸡蛋、鱼子、青蛙卵是她最初研究的对象。
    在这些研究以前，学者们都认为在卵中围绕着胚胎细胞的蛋白和卵黄只是胚胎所需用的贮藏的养料，是不具有任何生命特性的。奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在研究鸟卵的发育时，曾集中注意力于卵黄，因为在蝌蚪的血液中，曾发现了从卵黄球到血球的过渡形态。
    在鸡蛋发育各不同阶段上观察卵黄球的发展，是从研究那些在充满液体的胚下空腔中的卵黄团开始的。在这些卵黄球中，未曾看到任何正常细胞所具有的核质（ядерное　вещество）的形迹。
    随着鸡胚胎在孵卵器孵化条件下发育的程度，在相似的卵黄球中发现了规律地重复着的变化。在卵黄球的中心，出现了一个被细颗粒充满的空间。这种颗粒的中心被譬喻地称作“原形质核”。在鸡胚胎更进一步地人工孵化时，代替“原形质核”，而出现了一个同质的小泡，周围放射出去的像光线一样的线体。经高倍放大时，可以发现这些线体是由许多微小的原形质颗粒构成的，这些颗粒有时互相溶合。这种球体经专门的处理后，可以看到在它里面还没有真正的细胞核。然而到了发育的下一阶段，中心小体便会转变成为真正的显明可见的细胞核。这样我们便有了真正的细胞的结构。而最后，当更进一步的人工孵化时，我们便看到进行着各不同阶段“间接分裂”的球体，而“间接分裂”，乃是复杂的有机体的细胞所特有的。
    所有这些由卵黄球发育成细胞的图景，都是由联列切制鸡蛋标本片上观察到的，这些标本片并经过染色来显出细胞未形成和细胞已形成时的构造。除此以外，这种由卵黄球发育成细胞的过程，也曾用另一种方法观察到，就是以“培养法”，即在胚胎以外的人造环境中来研究。同时，还借显微电影摄影机的帮助，而对“球体细胞”的发育过程作了记载。
    在卵黄球培养刚刚开始时，它们散布于整个视野，极为均匀相似并发闪光。过了两小时后，就变得不透明而呈颗粒状。在许多球体中，颗粒作无规则的，所谓“勃朗”运动。在这些球体中有时看到有阿米巴运动。和阿米巴运动同时，在球体中颗粒亦发生运动，向中心集中并围绕着一个成形中的发亮小泡散成光线状。再经过一系列的发展阶段，就形成了一个年青的细胞，而最后，就成为一个能够间接分裂的细胞了。
    无论是以培养方法在活时观察到的或是从制成标本片材料上观察到的图景，都是同样的，这就是对于那些以各种不同研究方法所发现的同样现象的最好检查。
    新形成的细胞的下一步命运，也曾被考察。起初它们相互之间还显有若干距离，后来，它们就互相靠近，形成正常的“胚胎小叶”，从而进行胚的构成。分布在两个胚胎小叶之间因而处在不同情况下的卵黄球，发展便又不同，它们不形成个别的细胞，而成为整个的细胞团，就是“血小岛”（КровяноЙ　Островок）。“血小岛”再发育成为充满血液的血管。这一过程，对于在培养中的卵黄球也研究过，在这样培养中，经过一昼夜时间，可以观察到在各不同发展阶段上的血小岛。当研究贴附于血管壁的卵黄球的发展时，曾经观察到球体内的颗粒由球体周边到中心愈来愈大。显然是因为其中的血色素积蓄渐多，卵黄球开始变为红色。由变得很大，而且颜色也渐渐与血液的颜色接近，发育最成熟的卵黄球里分生出由大形颗粒长成的细胞，很像初生的红血球细胞。这些细胞渗透入血管，沿着这些血管在血浆中流着正常的红血球。
    在这些实验之后，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅又从事了卵细胞发展最初阶段的研究，所谓卵细胞，这就是以后要由之发育成一整个复杂有机体的细胞。她曾经取经过人工受精的鲟鱼（Севрюга）鱼子来作观察。原来，鲟鱼和其他若干动物的卵细胞在自己发育中要经过的一个没有核的阶段。对于这种细胞所作的观察，表明了这种卵细胞也要经过同从卵黄球长成细胞一样的阶段。
    所有这一切实验都证明着细胞可以由某种没有细胞结构的、比较简单的构成物形成。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅并未满足于此，她决定研究活质的发展及其在活的原形质中的构成形态的过程，而这种原形质是从有机体的细胞中分离出来的。为此，她选择了最恰当的研究材料“水螅”，这一种生物，一方面是处在非常低的发展阶段上，另一方面，具有非常强的再生力。
    为了研究活质，将水螅用机械的方法破坏到各个别的细胞都破坏了为止。从细胞提出来的活质再经过一次精细的操作，以除去任何还没有被破坏的细胞或其个别部分落入培养基中的可能。这样一来，当培养体养下之后，在培养基中，显微镜下所露出了的视野是非常清澈的。但仅仅经过一小时，视野中便出现了许多针尖般大小的小点，这些小点逐渐长大，长成为许多圆的蛋白质球。这些东西没有显著的内部构造，这就是所谓“胶状凝结体”（Коа　церватЫ）。用镁蓝来染色时，“胶状凝结体”表现得有如活的材料一样：即在自己的正常状况中，它们是不染色的，而在干燥时才能染色。在没有“营养”物质的环境中，在不适宜的条件下，胶状凝结体的发育是很坏的，未达成熟的形态，它们就死去了。然而在给它增加一些养料的条件下，情形就完全不同了，这些养料是从桡脚类动物抽出来的，水螅在天然环境下便是以这种动物为食的。在这种环境下，经过一昼夜，胶状凝结体就发育形成到细胞的地步了。在临分裂之前，细胞呈现得非常活动，而在进一步，由于不停的繁殖，它们就变成为一个由三十至三十五个细胞组成的球期（桑椹期）。所有以上的全部过程也都由显微电影摄影机照下来了。
    这些观察使奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅考虑到一个非常重要的问题，这个问题对于医学具有巨大的实用意义，这就是关于细胞的再生及活质在创伤痊愈过程中所起作用的问题。在任何创伤时，都不仅是组织的完整性被破坏，而且细胞本身的完整性亦被破坏了，从它们那里就分离出活质，这正如同水螅的细胞被破坏时分离出活质一样。在研究创伤痊愈的过程中，曾确定了出血和创伤痊愈速度间之密切关系：出血部分所形成的活质，就是新细胞发育的原始材料。
    根据这些观察，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在一九四○年提出用血液来治疗创伤。
    最近几年，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅进行了扩展和加深对于细胞由活质发生问题的研究工作以及对于活质本身的研究工作。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅实验室的研究员们还在一九四五年研究活质时便发现了有生命物质的一种能力，这就是与各种不同的化学物互相作用，而产生合成的晶体，他们称这些晶体为生物结晶体（БиокристаппЫ）。这些生物结晶体是介乎真正的结晶体和生物体间的一种中间形态，它们可能是从细胞到结晶体的过渡阶段，也可能相反，是从结晶体到细胞的过渡阶段。实验室的研究员们已经作到了从细胞到结晶体的过渡，他们不仅使细菌结晶，而且使纤毛虫类的整个有机体结晶。
    在研究由鸟卵蛋白质形成细胞的工作中，实验室的研究员们又指出了由结晶小体，即生物结晶体形成细胞的正规过程。从在蛋白质中产生生物结晶体的全部发展过程起，到完成了能够分裂的细胞为止他们都弄明白了。到更进一步的发育时，这些细胞就变为复杂的、类似桑椹期的球体，成为一整团的细胞。
    在由蛋白质形成细胞的过程中，在发育中的鸡卵不仅在构造上发现了形态上的变化，而且就活质的化学性质方面来看，也发觉有了复杂的变化及发展。例如，在未成细胞的各阶段上，在生物的构造中，有核酸出现并积蓄着，而核酸的存在，则是那能够新陈代谢的细胞组成体的特点。
    恩格斯说过：“生命——这就是蛋白体存在的一种形态”。
    在活质的生物学发展上，其本身内所发生的一切，基本上也都在蛋白质中发生，因为蛋白质是活质的主要组成部分。除蛋白质外，还有许多其他的物质也参与这一发展的过程，其中最重要的就是核酸。大家都知道，核酸是和细胞生长及分裂的过程有关的。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅在自己的许多实验中，曾经屡次确认核酸在有生命物质的发展与生活活动中有巨大的作用。例如，她曾指出胶状凝结体发展中的固定规律性。只是那些里面可以发现核酸存在的胶状凝结体，才生长和发展。但是，它们在生物过程中的具体作用如何，则还是一个悬而未决的问题。
    在下一步，实验室的研究员们在研究蛋白质和核酸间互相作用所发生的现象时，发现了核酸分子会使卷曲的蛋白质分子伸直。这种现象不能不影响新陈代谢的强化以及在活质中出现形成新的蛋白质分子（合成蛋白质）的能力。此外，还发现在同质无结构的活质中积累核酸达到充分数量时，可以观察到结构形成的过程，就是由活质形成细胞核、染色体、细胞膜等等的过程。这样看来，当活质发展为细胞时，其中必须有核酸的积蓄，由于积蓄核酸的结果，促进了新陈代谢，产生合成的蛋白质，出现了细胞的构造。
    细胞学实验室研究员们关于单细胞生物发展研究的工作也给人莫大的兴趣。他们的研究都证实了奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的结论，这就是生命并不是开始于细胞，而是始于较细胞结构更为低级的有生命物质，这种有生命物质就是“活质”。他们根据大量的材料证明阿米巴和纤毛虫不仅以分裂的方法繁殖，而且还借抛出微小颗粒的方法繁殖，每一微小颗粒都发展形成新的个体。这一种独特的繁殖法之所以有趣，是因为它说明了原生物繁殖得特别快的原因，这种高速的繁殖可以在某种条件下观察到，尤其是当培养中积累着代谢的产物时。
    细胞学实验室的许多实验证明了复杂的有机体的细胞都可能以类此方法进行繁殖，这些工作是从另外一个角度来追求关于有机体内突然急骤发生新生长物的原因，如恶性毒瘤发生的问题。
    实验室的研究员们还发现了下面的现象，这就是：在外部条件改变的影响下，阿米巴会从自己的身体抛出各种发育阶段的雏体。这些雏体重复着上代阿米巴的旧形态，一律发育成为长成的阿米巴。这样一来，由于能得到较原始的形态，就使我们能够在改变外部条件之下，把某些种原生物转变为另外的种类，并在研究者的观察下，以人工方法实现低级生物品类的变异。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅既以自己的许多研究驳倒了微耳和的基本论题，这就是细胞仅由细胞产生以及细胞外无任何生命等说法，因而很自然地，她也驳倒了他的所谓有机体是细胞的总和这一教条。她证明了发展不是开始于细胞，而是开始于比细胞更简单的无细胞结构的组织，在个体发展中，有机体在种变形态上不仅重复着活质发展的细胞阶段，并且重复着活质还停留在前细胞发展期间的那一阶段。她证明了细胞不仅以细胞分裂的方法而产生，并以由活质重新形成的方法来产生，有机体并不是许多细胞的总和，而是一个不单由细胞，并且由活质所组成的复杂体系，有机体是一个统一的整体，其中的各部分充分依从于整体，同时整体亦依从各部分，最后，它们一道又依从于外界的环境。
    这样一来，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的研究工作就驳倒了微耳和的陈旧的机械论的细胞理论，而代之以新的真正唯物的细胞理论。细胞的形态已经不复再被认作有生命物质存在的一种一成不变的、固定的、同一类型的、在不断的一连串的世代里依循着一根整齐链条的形态了。它们是组织在细胞中的活质的相当稳定的形态，但是当环境改变时，这样子的细胞便停止存在了，它们分解为许多极小的有生活能力的微粒，这些微粒在适宜的条件下能够重新发展成为细胞。有生命物质中的运动、变异和现象之互相制约——这就是生物过程所依照进行的重要原则。这样，奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的工作，就以许多关于生命的起源和发展的新事实，充实了科学。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅劳动的成果对于生物学及医学的许多部门都具有重大的意义。她的研究工作使我们更顺利的解决了恶性毒瘤的产生和发展的问题，体素的再生以及器官的恢复问题，以及与许多种疾病作斗争。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的著作充实了唯物论宇宙观的自然历史基础。它们对于加深有机体形态发展的辩证唯物观点有特别重大的意义。
    正当资产阶级的伪科学在忙于作毁灭亿万人民的凶恶的计划，忙于准备原子战争和细菌战争的时候，苏维埃的学者们则在研究着生命发展的庄严过程，钻研着科学如何积极地干预自然发展的问题。
    奥·博·勒柏辛斯卡娅的发现——是苏维埃科学强大高涨的雄辩的证明，苏维埃科学正在布尔什维克党和伟大的科学巨匠斯大林同志领导之下，为增进苏维埃人民的幸福，为在苏联建设共产主义而贡献出一切力量。
