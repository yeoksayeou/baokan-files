    Our Great Motherland
    China was one of the earliest countries to develop astronomy, and has the most complete historical records of astronomical phenomena. This is one of the ancient Chinese astronomical instruments handed down from history -- the armillary sphere. It can be used to determine the orientation of stars and observe the laws of celestial motion. This armillary sphere was manufactured during the Zhengtong reign of the Ming Dynasty (around 1440 AD) and is now kept by the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    我们伟大的祖国
    我国天文学发达最早，历史上关于天文的记录也最完备。这是我国古代相传的天文仪器之一——浑天仪。它可以测定星辰的方位，观察天体运行的规律。这个浑天仪，是明朝正统年间所制造的（约当公历一四四○年左右），现由中国科学院所属南京紫金山天文台保管着。
