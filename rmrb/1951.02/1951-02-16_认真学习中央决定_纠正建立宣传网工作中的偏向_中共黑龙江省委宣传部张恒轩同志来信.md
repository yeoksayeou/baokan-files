　　Conscientiously Study the Central Decision and Correct Deviations in Establishing Propaganda Network Work
    ——Letter from Comrade Zhang Hengxuan, Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

To the Editors:

    The Party committees at all levels here have begun to attach importance to the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network. The county committees of Tailai, Zhaodong, Baicheng, Zhaoyuan, and Kedong, as well as the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee, have convened meetings of district committee secretaries, propaganda committee members, and branch secretaries to discuss and formulate specific measures for implementing this decision; and have reviewed the propaganda work of the past seven months. Other counties have also conducted inspections in one district or one village in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's decision. Reports from Party committees at all levels to the provincial Party committee show that the province's propaganda network has indeed taken initial shape and has promoted the industrial and agricultural production movement and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. However, due to insufficient study of the Central Committee's decision by Party committees at all levels, the following problems still exist:

    First, some Party committee members have not deeply studied and researched the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and some Party committees have not even read this decision at all. Therefore, some Party committees still regard propaganda work as the work of propaganda cadres, and even believe that this work is "dispensable." Director Liu of the Bei'an Postal and Telecommunications Bureau is like this. He not only does not help the propagandists in his own agency, but also told the general branch: "Our agency cannot do this work." The secretary of the Zhaodong Seventh District Committee said: "We are very busy now, we can put the work of establishing a propaganda network to a time when we are less busy." When Hao Hongxiang, a propagandist in Mingsheng Village, Dedu, asked branch secretary Liu Hongxiang for instructions on propaganda work, Liu Hongxiang said: "Do whatever you want. Isn't this just formalism! What's the use? Propaganda alone cannot complete the task." Many factory propagandists in the short-term branch secretary and propagandist training class convened by the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee reflected: "Although our workshops and branches have propaganda organizations, the general branch and enterprise Party committee do not lead, and the factory director does not care, so propaganda work has not been carried out." These phenomena fully illustrate that some Party committees still do not have a sufficient understanding of the correct instruction in the Central Committee's decision that "propaganda workers are an important bridge for the Party to connect with the people." Therefore, Party committees at all levels urgently need to restudy the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, understand the spirit and essence of this decision; and in the study, carry out criticism and self-criticism, correct some erroneous ideas about the work of establishing a propaganda network, and quickly establish the Party's propaganda network.

    Second, the work of establishing propaganda networks in some areas is very perfunctory, and propaganda workers have not been developed in accordance with the Central Committee's decision. Of the seventy-one branches and five hundred and sixty-seven propagandists in Kedong County, although fifty-nine villages and four hundred and seventy-nine propagandists meet the requirements of the Central Committee's decision and have played some role; according to what is already known, there are still twelve villages and eighty-eight propagandists who do not meet the requirements of the Central Committee. Among them, three villages and twenty propagandists were elected by mass meetings, one village and eight propagandists were fabricated by the branch secretary, and some were approved by the branch and the district committee, but the propagandists themselves were not aware of it. The branch secretary of Kesukeli Village, Suiling, registered thirty members who delivered public grain as propagandists. He also said: "These people are all good, otherwise, how could the people have chosen them?!" The main reason for these phenomena is that these county and district committees have not carried out this work seriously and earnestly, and there is a simple task-oriented viewpoint. Therefore, in addition to raising the Party committee's understanding of the work of propaganda workers in order to implement the Central Committee's decision; we must also conduct in-depth inspection and appropriate reorganization of the province's propaganda work, carefully select propaganda workers in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee; and ensure that the branch approves and the higher-level Party organization approves.

    Third, although some Party committees have paid attention to the development of some propaganda workers, they have not paid attention to the training and education of propaganda workers. There are also individual Party committees that mistakenly use propaganda workers as administrative cadres. This makes it impossible for the Party's propaganda work to be carried out quickly, and even some mistakes have occurred in propaganda, which greatly hinders the implementation of the Party and government's policies. Although a certain district in Taonan has also established a propaganda and teaching station and stipulated a lecturing system; in reality, no one is doing practical work. When the lecturing date arrives, the district committees push each other, saying: "There is nothing to talk about even if we go, let's forget it!" The branch secretary of Zhenchai Village, Ninth District, Zhaodong, said: "The war service mobilization is over, the victory news of the recovery of Hancheng has also been publicized, the Yangko dance has also been performed, there is nothing to publicize, let's forget it!" Therefore, the propaganda content of some propagandists is "the same old stuff." Gao Hailong, a propagandist in the Third District of Dedu, publicized the news of the victory of the Second Battle of Korea for twenty days, and the masses said: "Our ears are tired of hearing it!" The Tailai urban district committee does not pay attention to the leadership of propaganda workers at ordinary times. Whenever an urgent task arrives, it finds the propaganda workers and assigns them a certain amount of tasks that must be completed. This gives the masses a bad impression: "Propaganda workers are here to ask for tasks, not to publicize." This bad phenomenon seriously affects the Party's propaganda work, and Party committees at all levels should immediately make effective improvements.

    Party committees at all levels should gradually establish systems for propaganda worker work conferences, reports, inspections, and reporters, regularly provide propaganda workers with popular propaganda materials, establish propaganda and teaching stations; and periodically impart propaganda content to raise the working level of propaganda workers to the level required by the Central Committee.

### 认真学习中央决定  纠正建立宣传网工作中的偏向——中共黑龙江省委宣传部张恒轩同志来信

　　认真学习中央决定  纠正建立宣传网工作中的偏向       
    ——中共黑龙江省委宣传部张恒轩同志来信编辑同志：
    我们这里各级党委已开始重视中央关于建立宣传网的决定。太来、肇东、白城、肇源、克东等县委及齐齐哈尔市市委，均已召开了区委书记、宣传委员与支部书记会议，讨论与制定了执行这一决定的具体办法；并对过去七个月的宣传工作作了检查。其他县也根据中央决定的精神在一个区或一个村进行了检查。从各级党委向省委的报告中看到全省宣传网，确已初具规模，并已推动了工、农业生产运动与抗美援朝运动。但是也因各级党委对中央决定研究不够，还存在以下几个问题：
    第一、有一部分党委委员，还没有深入地学习与研究中央关于建立宣传网的决定，甚至还有根本没有阅读过这一决定的党委。因此，有的党委把宣传工作仍当作是宣传干部的工作，甚至认为这一工作“可有可无”。北安邮电局刘局长就是如此，不但对本机关的宣传员工作不予帮助，并且向总支提出：“我们机关不能做这个工作。”肇东七区区委书记说：“现在工作很忙，可以把建立宣传网的工作放到闲时候去作。”德都民兴村宣传员郝洪祥向支书刘洪祥请示宣传工作时，刘洪祥说：“你怎样搞就怎样搞吧，这玩艺还不是形式主义！有啥用，光宣传也不能完成任务。”齐齐哈尔市市委召开的短期支部书记、宣传员训练班中，许多工厂的宣传员反映：“虽然我们车间支部都有宣传组织，但是总支、企业党委都不领导，厂长也不管，所以宣传工作没有展开。”以上这些现象，充分地说明了现在仍有一些党委对中央决定中所指出的“宣传员是党联系人民群众的重要桥梁”这一正确指示认识不足。因此，目前各级党委急需重新学习中央关于建立宣传网的决定，领会这一决定的精神与实质；并在学习中，展开批评与自我批评，纠正对建立宣传网工作的一些错误观念，迅速建立起党的宣传网来。
    第二、有些地区的建立宣传网的工作是十分潦草的，并没有按照中央决定来发展宣传员。克东县七十一个支部，五百六十七名宣传员中，固然有五十九个村，四百七十九名宣传员是符合中央决定中要求的，并已起到了一些作用；但据已知道的尚有十二个村八十八名宣传员是不合乎中央要求的，其中有三个村，二十名宣传员是群众大会选举的，有一个村八名宣传员是支部书记假造的名单，还有些是支部已通过，区委也已批准，而宣传员本人还不知道的。绥棱克苏克里村支部书记把三十名送公粮的委员，都登记为宣传员。他还说：“这些人都不错，不然老百姓能挑选他吗？！”所以产生这些现象，主要是这些县区委没有严肃的认真的来进行这一工作，存在单纯的任务观点。因此目前除了提高党委对宣传员工作的认识，以贯彻中央决定外；还应对全省宣传工作进行深入的检查与适当的整理，按照中央所规定的条件，认真的选择宣传员；并确实做到支部通过高一级党组织批准。
    第三、有些党委虽然已注意发展了一部分宣传员，但还未注意到对宣传员的培养与教育工作。也还有个别党委错误地把宣传员当作行政干部使用。这样就使党的宣传员工作不能迅速展开，甚至在宣传中发生了一些错误，因此大大的妨碍了党与政府政策的贯彻。洮南某区虽然也建立了宣传传授站，规定了讲授制度；实际上，并没有人去作实际工作，到了讲授日期，区委互相推托说：“去了没啥讲的，算了吧！”肇东九区榛柴村支部书记说：“战勤动员也完啦，汉城光复的胜利消息也宣传了，秧歌也扭了，没什么宣传了，算了吧！”因此有些宣传员的宣传内容是“老一套”，德都三区宣传员高海龙，把朝鲜二次战役胜利的消息，宣传了二十天，群众都说：“耳朵都听厌啦！”太来城区区委，平时不注意宣传员的领导工作，在每次紧急任务到来时，就把宣传员找来分配给必须完成的一定数量的任务。这样给群众一个坏印象：“宣传员是来要任务的，不是宣传的。”这种恶劣现象严重的影响了党的宣传员工作，各级党委应当立即作有效的改进。
    各级党委应该逐步的建立起宣传员工作会议、汇报、检查以及报告员等制度，经常的供给宣传员通俗的宣传资料，建立宣传传授站；按期的传授宣传内容，把宣传员的工作水平提高到中央所要求的水平上来。
