Reactions to People's Daily Criticism
    Regarding the Violation of Cooperative Policy by Xinhua Shoe Factory of Shijiazhuang Shoe Production Cooperative

  I. Excerpts from a Letter from Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative:
    To the Editors:
    We believe that the criticism made by Comrade Guo Muwen in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 19th, regarding the Shijiazhuang Xinhua Shoe Factory (production cooperative) violating cooperative policy by hiring a large number of workers, leading to wage disputes, is correct. We express our gratitude to Comrade Guo. Our self-criticism is detailed below:

    (1) We did not uphold the principle of adhering to policy sufficiently. Although we initially refused to provide a guarantee when Xinhua Shoe Factory and the Shoe United Cooperative requested it, we ultimately carelessly did so. Moreover, we failed to promptly report the loss event at Xinhua Shoe Factory to the higher-level cooperative and the government. This fully demonstrates our lack of organization and discipline.

    (2) The loss of over 90 million yuan at Xinhua Shoe Factory was certainly due to the factory's focus on profitability. However, our leadership work was not thorough enough, leading Xinhua Shoe Factory to hire workers without principle in order to complete tasks, violating the principles of the cooperative. We should bear the main responsibility.

    (3) We were not aware of Xinhua Shoe Factory's recruitment of workers in Zhengzhou beforehand. After the workers were recruited and returned, we only gave verbal criticism, simply believing that "completing the task" was most important, and did not emphasize that it was wrong for a production cooperative to hire workers. We also did not make specific arrangements on how to absorb workers into the cooperative.

    (4) Although we are in a leadership position, we only made verbal arrangements and lacked supervision and inspection. When it was discovered that Xinhua Shoe Factory was losing money, the general cooperative only instructed the Shoe United Cooperative to take over the tasks of Xinhua Shoe Factory, but Xinhua Shoe Factory did not transfer the tasks to the Shoe United Cooperative, and the general cooperative did not supervise or inspect. This laissez-faire attitude towards work and irresponsible attitude towards lower-level cooperatives is also worthy of our self-criticism.

    (5) We lacked knowledge of shoemaking and did not pay enough attention to contracts. We only believed what Xinhua Shoe Factory said but did not help them correctly assess potential problems.

    In summary, due to our bureaucratic leadership, lack of thoroughness in our work, lack of specific assistance and supervision for lower-level cooperatives, insufficient study of the Cooperative Law, and failure to properly grasp policies, we tolerated the large-scale hiring of workers by lower-level cooperatives, violating the principles of the cooperative. These should all be taken as lessons.

              Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei Province

  II. Excerpts from a Letter from Shijiazhuang Shoe Production Cooperative:
    To the Editors:
    As cooperatives across the country are actively rectifying their businesses, our Xinhua Shoe Factory, under our jurisdiction, has suffered losses and labor disputes due to operations that violate cooperative policies. We should conduct a deep self-criticism for this. The Shoe United Cooperative and Xinhua Shoe Factory are nominally in a leadership relationship, but in reality, we did not firmly grasp leadership, leading to this error. When Xinhua Shoe Factory requested the city cooperative's guarantee to order shoe contracts, Section Chief Yan of the general cooperative instructed that hiring temporary shoe workers violated cooperative policy and firmly refused to provide a guarantee. However, we still did not recognize this error and repeatedly requested the general cooperative to provide a guarantee for us. After the shoe contracts were signed, we did not play a leading or supervisory role. This is a manifestation of our irresponsibility towards work and irresponsibility towards superiors and subordinates. Later, when we discovered that Xinhua Shoe Factory was incurring significant losses, we did not provide concrete assistance to help them find solutions. After the general cooperative learned that Xinhua Shoe Factory was incurring losses, it repeatedly ordered our cooperative to take over Xinhua Shoe Factory's work, but we did not implement this and did not report to higher levels. This is our serious mistake. We accept this lesson and guarantee that we will not repeat this mistake in the future. We will definitely obey leadership and do our job well.

            Wang Fulian, Director of Shijiazhuang Shoe Production United Cooperative

  III. Excerpts from a Letter from Xinhua Shoe Factory:
    To the Editors:
    Comrade Guo Muwen's criticism of our factory for violating cooperative policy, hiring a large number of workers, and thus causing wage disputes is correct. We now make the following self-criticism:

    (1) Our understanding of cooperative policy was vague. Therefore, when the cooperative experienced operational difficulties last year, we did not think of solutions in accordance with the principles of the cooperative. Instead, we sought to solve the livelihood difficulties of cooperative members by contracting orders, recruiting workers, and pursuing profits.

    (2) In order to complete tasks, we recruited workers in Zhengzhou in the name of the city general cooperative without the permission of the city general cooperative and signed a contract with the Zhengzhou Labor Bureau. This is a concrete manifestation of our lack of organization and discipline.

    (3) After the workers completed the shoe-making task, we did not implement the wage contract and pay the workers' wages on time, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. On the one hand, this was because our losses were too great to pay; but at the same time, the fact that we did not pay enough attention to the contract is also true.

            Wang Qi, Director of Shijiazhuang Xinhua Production Cooperative Shoe Factory

### 对人民日报批评的反应  关于石家庄鞋业生产合作社新华鞋厂违反合作社政策的问题

　　对人民日报批评的反应
    关于石家庄鞋业生产合作社新华鞋厂违反合作社政策的问题
  一、石家庄供销社来信摘要编辑同志：
    一月十九日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊载郭慕文同志对石市新华鞋厂（生产合作社）违反合作社政策大批雇用工人，以致发生工资纠纷的批评，我们认为是正确的。我们对郭同志表示感谢。兹将我们的检讨分述如下：
    （一）我们坚持政策的原则性不够。在新华鞋厂及鞋联社要求我们作保时，起初我们虽然拒绝了，可是最后依然马虎地作了保。及至新华鞋厂发生赔亏事件后，也不及时向上级社及政府报告。充分表现了我们的无组织无纪律。
    （二）这次新华鞋厂赔亏达九千多万元，这固然是由于该厂营利观点作祟，但我们领导工作不深入，以致新华鞋厂为了完成任务，无原则地招雇工人，违背了合作社的原则，我们应负主要责任。
    （三）新华鞋厂去郑州招收工人，事先我们并不知道。招工人回来后，我们仅给予口头批评，单纯认为“完成任务”要紧，没有重视生产，合作社雇用工人是不对的。对如何吸收工人入社等问题，也未作具体布置。
    （四）我们虽然处于领导地位，但单纯口头布置，缺少督促检查。在发现新华鞋厂亏累时，总社仅指示鞋联社去接新华鞋厂的任务，但新华鞋厂并没有把任务移交鞋联社，总社也不督促检查。这种对工作放任自流，对下级社不负责任的态度，也值得我们检讨。
    （五）我们缺乏制鞋的知识，对合同又不重视。只相信新华鞋厂的话，但并没有帮助他们正确估计可能发生的问题。
    总之，由于我们领导上的官僚主义，工作不深入，缺少对下级社具体帮助和督促检查，对合作社法学习不够，不能很好掌握政策，容忍下级社大批雇用工人，违反了合作社的原则，这些都应引为教训。
              河北省石家庄市供销合作社
  二、石家庄鞋业生产合作社来信摘要编辑同志：
    在全国合作社正积极整顿业务的今天，我社所辖新华鞋厂却因经营违反了合作政策，以致亏累和发生劳资纠纷。对此我社是应该进行深刻检讨的。鞋联社和新华鞋厂名义上是领导关系，而实际上我们并没有抓紧领导，以致造成了此次的错误。当新华鞋厂到市合作总社请求打保订做鞋合同时，总社阎科长曾指示：招临时鞋工是违反合作政策的。并坚决不允打保。但我们还没有认识这一错误，一再要求总社给我们作保。在订立做鞋合同后，我们并没有起领导、监督作用，这是我们对工作不负责任，对上下级不负责任的表现。后来发现新华鞋厂亏累甚巨时，我们没有具体帮助他们想法解决。总社知道新华鞋厂亏累之后，曾三令五申派我社接替新华鞋厂工作，但我们没有执行，更未向上级报告。这是我们的严重错误。我们接受这次的教训，保证今后不再蹈此覆辙，一定服从领导，将工作搞好。
            石家庄市鞋业生产联合社主任  王富连
  三、新华鞋厂来信摘要编辑同志：
    郭慕文同志对我社违反合作社政策、大批雇用工人，以致发生工资纠纷的批评是正确的。现在我们检讨如下：
    （一）我们对合作社的政策认识模糊，所以去年合作社经营困难时，我们并不按照合作社的方针去想办法，却以包揽定货、招收工人，追逐利润，企图以此解决社员生活的困难。
    （二）为了完成任务，没有经过市总社的许可，就用市总社的名义到郑州招收工人，在郑州劳动局订立合同。这是我们无组织无纪律的具体表现。
    （三）在工人完成了做鞋任务后，我们没有执行工资合同，按时支付工人工资，使工人不满。这一方面固然是由于我们亏累太大，无法开支；但同时我们对合同不够重视也是事实。
            石家庄市新华生产合作鞋厂主任  王琦
