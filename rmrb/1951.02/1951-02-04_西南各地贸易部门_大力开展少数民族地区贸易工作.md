Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Trade departments in Southwest China are vigorously carrying out trade work in various ethnic minority areas. The Xikang Provincial Trade Company has made the communication of Kang-Tibet trade its top priority. In addition to actively supporting the production of tea, a daily necessity for Tibetans, in areas such as Ya'an, it is also vigorously purchasing local products from Tibetan areas. From June to the end of December last year, it has shipped 300,000 packages of tea (each package weighing 16 "jin" on the balance) to the Tibetan areas. The output of local products such as wool, musk, and borax from the Tibetan areas has also reached 150 tons. The Kang-Tibet trade, which had long been paralyzed, has been reactivated.
    The trade work in ethnic minority areas of Yunnan Province has also been gradually launched. The state-owned Wuding Special District Trade Branch has established seven fixed purchasing and sales teams and three mobile teams in the Yi and Miao ethnic groups in Wuding and Luquan counties since August last year. It adopts the method of taking turns to catch up with the market to carry out purchasing and sales work. The state-owned Yiliang Trade Branch also helped the Axi ethnic group in the West Mountain District organize supply and marketing cooperatives. In Lijiang County in northwestern Yunnan, state-owned trade institutions have also overcome transportation difficulties and transported a large amount of salt to the Lisu, Nu, and other ethnic people living in the Nujiang River Valley. The Pu'er Special District has also set up six salt storage stations at the ferry crossings on both sides of the Lancang River to regularly supply and sell salt.
    Since September last year, the Guizhou Provincial State-owned Trade Company has steadily launched trade work in various ethnic minority areas with the victory of suppressing bandits. At present, 250 trade groups have been established in the Dushan Special District, where ethnic minorities and Han people live together. These groups are widely engaged in purchasing and sales work, and through farmers' associations in various districts and townships, they organize ethnic minorities to transport and sell salt and purchase local products on a commission basis. As of the end of December last year, Dushan District alone had purchased more than 7,900 dan of tung oil.
    The state-owned trade companies in western Sichuan, northern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan have also established institutions in ethnic minority areas in their respective regions. The People's Governments of northern Sichuan and western Sichuan have built two main roads from Pingwu to Jiangyou and from Maoxian to Guanxian to facilitate foreign trade in various ethnic minority areas. The state-owned trade company in southern Sichuan also actively encourages and organizes private merchants to buy and sell goods in the Leibo and Mabian ethnic minority areas.
    State-owned trade companies in various places give special consideration to ethnic minorities in terms of sales and purchase prices. The Xikang State-owned Trade Company has increased the exchange ratio of wool to tea to eight packages of tea for every dan of wool. Before the Anti-Japanese War, every dan of wool could only be exchanged for six packages of tea, and during the Anti-Japanese War, it fell to three packages. This not only enabled ethnic minorities to gain more benefits, but also made the wool from the west bank of the Jinsha River flow continuously to Kangding.
    The gradual development of trade companies in various places has found a way out for the local products that have been unsalable in ethnic minority areas for many years. For example, the 90 households of Lisu people in Zhawo Village, Jiangbei Town, Yuanmou County, Yunnan Province, exchanged 3,500 pieces of native cloth with their local linen last year due to the marketable product. In addition to wearing it themselves, each family still has one or two pieces of native cloth in stock.
    With the development of trade work, the relationship between ethnic minorities and Han people is also beginning to change. Ethnic minorities who had been hiding in the mountains all year round before liberation are now flocking to cities to sell goods. Since November last year, the number of ethnic minorities from Lixian, Maoxian, Songpan and other places in western Sichuan Administrative Region to Chengdu to buy and sell goods has gradually increased. Some people come from as far away as Gansu and Xinjiang to purchase Chengdu's famous specialty - brocade.
    Now, trade departments in various places are actively recruiting and training a large number of ethnic minority trade cadres in order to further develop trade work in ethnic minority areas.

### 西南各地贸易部门  大力开展少数民族地区贸易工作

    大力开展少数民族地区贸易工作
    【新华社讯】西南各地贸易部门正大力开展各少数民族地区的贸易工作。西康省贸易公司将沟通康藏贸易列为首要工作，除在雅安等地积极扶植藏民日常生活必需的茶叶生产外，并大力收购藏民地区的土产。自去年六月至十二月底，先后运往藏区的茶叶已达三十万包（每包合十六斤天平秤）。从藏区运出的羊毛、麝香、硼砂等土产亦达一百五十吨。长期陷于瘫痪状态的康藏贸易又重新活跃起来。
    云南各少数民族地区的贸易工作也已逐步展开。国营武定专区贸易分公司自去年八月份起，先后在武定、禄劝两县彝、苗族中建立了七个固定采购推销小组和三个流动小组，采取轮流赶集办法进行收购与推销工作。国营宜良贸易分公司并帮助西山区阿西族组织了供销合作社。在云南西北部的丽江县，国营贸易机构也曾克服交通困难，运送大批食盐到怒江峡谷地带居住的傈僳、怒子等族人民中去。普洱专区并在澜沧江两岸渡口设立六个存盐站，经常供销食盐。
    贵州省国营贸易公司自去年九月份以后，随着剿匪的胜利，即稳步展开各少数民族地区的贸易工作。目前少数民族与汉族杂居的独山专区已建立二百五十个贸易组，广泛展开收购与推销工作，同时并通过各区、乡农民协会，以代销代购方式组织少数民族运销食盐和收购土产。截至去年十二月底止，独山区仅桐油一项即收购七千九百多担。
    川西、川北、川南国营贸易公司也分别在各该区少数民族聚居地区设立了机构。川北、川西人民政府为畅通各少数民族地区对外贸易，特修筑平武到江油、茂县到灌县两条大道。川南国营贸易公司并积极鼓励与组织私商到雷波、马边少数民族地区买卖货物。
    各地国营贸易公司在推销和收购的价格上都对各少数民族特别照顾。西康国营贸易公司将羊毛和茶叶的交换比价提高到每担羊毛换茶叶八包，而抗日战争前每担羊毛仅换茶叶六包，抗日战争期间更跌至三包。这样不仅使少数民族人民得到更多利益，且使金沙江西岸羊毛源源运来康定。
    各地贸易公司业务的日渐开展，使各少数民族地区多年滞销的土产找到了出路。如云南元谋县江北镇杂窝村的九十户傈僳人民去年因土产麻布有了销路，全村仅用麻布一项即换回三千五百件土布，除每人穿用外，现每家都还存有一两件土布。
    随着贸易工作的开展，各少数民族与汉族的关系也在开始改变。解放前一年四季躲在深山的各少数民族，现在纷纷赶来城市贩卖货物。自去年十一月份起川西行政区的理县、茂县、松潘等地少数民族到成都买卖货物的便日渐增多。有的远自甘肃、新疆等地来采购成都著名的特产——锦绣。
    现在各地贸易部门正积极吸收并训练大批少数民族贸易干部，以便进一步开展少数民族地区的贸易工作。
