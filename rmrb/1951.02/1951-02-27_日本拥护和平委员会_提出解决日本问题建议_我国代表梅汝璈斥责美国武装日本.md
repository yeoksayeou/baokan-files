　　Japan Peace Protection Committee
　  Proposes Solutions to the Japanese Problem
　　Chinese Representative Mei Ru'ao Accuses the US of Arming Japan

    【Xinhua News Agency, February 26th】Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Peace Protection Committee has put forward the following proposals for consideration and adoption by the World Peace Council, which is currently meeting in Berlin: First, the Council should call on the people of the world to demand the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan based on the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, and to oppose the arming of Japan; Second, the Council should call on peace advocates around the world to urge the Allied governments to strictly fulfill the obligations of the Potsdam Proclamation, because Japanese militarism and fascism are being revived in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation; Third, the Council should send representatives to reside in Japan.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 26th】At the morning session of the World Peace Council on the 24th, Mr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese representative and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, delivered a speech, denouncing the United States for rearming Japan, saying: During the Tokyo trial of Japanese war criminals, we spent more than seven months listening to testimonies and sworn statements proving the various atrocities committed by the Japanese invading army. The heinous Nanjing Massacre was the most prominent example. Now, the U.S. government is trying to restore the entire Japanese invading army that committed these heinous crimes. I believe that not only the Chinese people and the Asian people are determined to oppose the remilitarization of Japan, but also all peace-loving people in the world will resolutely unite and work together to crush the shameful conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.
    Mei Ru'ao continued to talk about the necessity to prohibit new war propaganda, saying: We all know that new war propaganda is prevalent in the United States. The location of the United Nations, New York, has become the center of new war propaganda. Mei Ru'ao emphasized: For the sake of the people of the world, we must resolutely oppose new war propaganda. We must demand that the governments and parliaments of all countries promptly enact laws to prohibit any form of new war propaganda and severely punish all war-mongers.

　　日本拥护和平委员会
　  提出解决日本问题建议
　　我国代表梅汝璈斥责美国武装日本
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社二十二日电，东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会提出下列建议，请正在柏林举行会议的世界和平理事会考虑采纳：第一、理事会应号召全世界人民要求根据波茨坦公告及其他国际协定，缔结全面、公正的对日和约，并反对武装日本；第二、理事会应号召全世界和平拥护者促使盟国政府严格履行波茨坦公告的义务，因为日本的军国主义和法西斯主义正在违反波茨坦公告的情形下复活起来；第三，理事会应派代表驻在日本。
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】在世界和平理事会二十四日上午会议上，中国代表、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈博士发表演说，斥责美国重新武装日本称：在东京审讯日本战犯的时候，我们曾费了七个多月的时间来听取证明日本侵略军各种暴行的许多证言和宣誓陈述。罪恶昭彰的南京大屠杀便是最显著的例子。现在，美国政府正力图恢复犯过这些滔天罪行的整个日本侵略军。我相信不仅中国人民与亚洲人民决心反对日本的重新军国主义化，而且全世界爱好和平的人民也将坚决地团结起来，共同努力粉碎美帝国主义的可耻阴谋。
    梅汝璈继谈到必须禁止新战争宣传时说：我们都知道，新战争宣传盛行于美国。联合国的所在地纽约已成了新战争宣传的中心。梅汝璈强调称：为了全世界的人民，我们必须坚决反对新战争宣传。我们必须要求一切国家的政府与议会迅速制订法律，禁止任何形式的新战争宣传，并严惩一切战争贩子。
