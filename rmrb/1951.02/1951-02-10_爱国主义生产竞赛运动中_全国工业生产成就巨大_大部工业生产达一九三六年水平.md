　　In the Patriotic Production Emulation Drive
    National Industrial Production Achievements are Enormous
    Most Industrial Production Reaches the 1936 Level
    [From Our Newspaper] In the tense patriotic production emulation drive, workers across the country, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, have victoriously completed the 1950 industrial production plan one after another, and have entered 1951 full of confidence. Most industrial production has already reached the 1936 level. Steel, textiles, and other industries have even exceeded it.
    The 1950 industrial production plan was completed while overcoming the difficulties brought about by war and old China's industry, as well as the serious threat of American imperialist aggression. After the establishment of the Central People's Government in 1949, it convened professional meetings of various major industries one after another in accordance with the policy of restoring and developing industrial production outlined in the Common Program, and formulated plans for the restoration and adjustment of various industrial productions. It also invested 23.9 percent of all fiscal expenditures into economic construction. Thus, coupled with the efforts of the broad masses of workers, in addition to restoring railway traffic to more than 22,000 kilometers by the end of last year, the focus of the country's state-owned industries achieved tremendous success in restoration last year.
    The Northeast is an important industrial base in our country. In 1950, workers in the Northeast completed and exceeded last year's annual production tasks under the threat of American imperialist aggression. The total value of industrial production increased by 100.15 percent compared to 1949. The equipment capacity (production capacity, excluding unfinished projects) of 34 major industrial products at the end of 1950 increased compared with the equipment capacity at the end of 1949. The output of gold and silver ore reached 982.4, almost nine times as much. The smallest increase, such as ammonium sulfate, was also 103.9.
    State-owned industrial production in North China has also been largely completed. Various major industrial productions in Tianjin have completed last year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded it. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth increased by 37 percent and 42 percent respectively compared to the previous year, setting a new record in the history of Tianjin's public textile industry. Nine major industrial products in Shanxi also completed their annual production tasks one month to one and a half months ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by an average of 13.294 percent, and the annual output also increased by about one time compared to the previous year. State-owned factories and mines in Beijing and the provinces and cities of Pingyuan, Chahar, and Hebei have also largely completed their annual production plans.
    East China is a region where industry is relatively concentrated in our country. Over the past year, it has completed its annual production tasks in the struggle against imperialist blockade and sabotage. Various major products of factories and mines in Shanghai and Nanjing under the East China Industrial Department completed their tasks ahead of schedule in December last year. Eighteen products such as iron sulfide, steel ingots, and cast steel exceeded the plan. Among them, transformers, electromagnetic wires, and dry batteries all exceeded the plan by more than 30 percent.
    Central and South China's industry was severely damaged under the long-term reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and industrial production fell by about 50 percent or more. The People's Government adopted the correct policy of restoring the original industrial and handicraft production as a priority, and seeking development on the basis of restoration, and organized and led the broad masses of workers to carry out restoration work. Therefore, by the end of November last year, many major industrial products had exceeded the plan. Pure tungsten ore exceeded the plan by 9.2 percent, pure antimony exceeded by 25.6 percent, refined tin exceeded by 47.8 percent, and manganese ore, ordinary steel, electric motors, transformers, etc. all exceeded the plan. The annual delivery task of non-ferrous metals such as tungsten, antimony, and tin was nearly completed by the end of October.
    State-owned industries in the Northwest and Southwest regions have also achieved considerable success in restoration and transformation last year. The main products of cotton yarn and machinery industry in the Northwest region have completed the plan, and cotton yarn has exceeded the plan by 4 percent. Others such as cotton cloth, coal, and electricity are also close to completion. In the Southwest region, more than ten factories such as Chongqing's 29th Factory and 50th Factory, and Gejiu Tin Mine in Yunnan, have also completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.
    All these achievements in industrial production are inseparable from the correct leadership of the People's Government, the efforts of the working class throughout the country, and the help of Soviet experts. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits have tried their best to undermine our industrial production and construction work, but these attempts by the enemy have been shattered. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and trade union organizations, workers across the country have participated in the management of factories and mines, and actively improved production through creation, invention, and technological improvement. Some machines that used to rely on foreign imports can now be made by ourselves, and past production records have been broken. In some industrial and mining enterprises, economic accounting systems have also been implemented to lay the foundation for accumulating capital and developing production for the country. Soviet experts have also dedicated their experience accumulated in more than 30 years of socialist construction to help the restoration of Chinese industry with the lofty fraternal friendship for the Chinese people.

　　爱国主义生产竞赛运动中
    全国工业生产成就巨大      
    大部工业生产达一九三六年水平
    【本报讯】在紧张的爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，全国工人在中央人民政府的领导下，已胜利地先后完成了一九五○年工业生产计划，满怀信心地进入了一九五一年。大部工业生产业已达到一九三六年水平。钢铁、纺织等并有超过。
    一九五○年工业生产计划，是在克服战争和旧中国工业所给予的困难，以及美帝国主义侵略的严重威胁下完成的。一九四九年，中央人民政府成立后，即依据共同纲领恢复和发展工业生产的方针，连续召开了各种主要工业的专业会议，制订了各项工业生产的恢复和调整计划。并以全部财政开支的百分之二十三·九投入了经济建设。这样，加上广大工人的努力，除使全国铁路在去年底恢复通车达二万二千余公里外，并使去年全国国营工业的重点恢复获得了巨大成绩。
    东北是我国重要的工业基地。一九五○年东北工人在美帝国主义侵略的威胁下完成并超过了去年全年的生产任务。工业生产总值已较一九四九年增加了百分之一○○·一五。三十四种主要工业产品一九五○年底的设备能力（生产能力，不包括未完成工程）和一九四九年底的设备能力相比，均有增加。金银原矿达到了九八二·四，几达九倍。最少如硫酸铔也为一○三·九。
    华北国营工业生产也已大部完成。天津的各种主要工业生产都提前并超额完成了去年生产计划。棉纱和棉布较前年增加了百分之三十七和百分之四十二，创津市公营纺织业有史以来的新纪录。山西九种主要工业产品亦均提前一月至一个半月完成了全年生产任务，平均超过了百分之一三·二九四，年产量亦较前年增加一倍左右。北京市及平原、察哈尔、河北等省、市营厂矿，也大都完成了全年生产计划。
    华东是我国工业较为集中的地区，一年来在与帝国主义的封锁、破坏进行斗争中完成了全年生产任务。华东工业部所属沪、宁各厂矿的各种主要产品在去年十二月即先后提前完成。硫化铁、钢锭、铸钢等十八种产品均超过了计划。其中变压器、电磁线、干电池等都超过计划百分之三十以上。
    中南工业在蒋介石匪帮长期反动统治下曾遭受到严重破坏，工业生产下降约百分之五十以上。人民政府采取了尽先恢复原有工业和手工业生产，并在恢复基础上求得发展的正确方针，组织、领导了广大工人群众进行恢复工作。因此，在去年十一月底许多主要工业产品即已超过计划。净钨砂超过了计划的百分之九·二，纯锑超过了百分之二五·六，精锡超过百分之四七·八，锰砂、普通钢材、电动机、变压器等均超额完成。有色金属之钨锑锡的全年交货任务十月底即接近完成。
    西北、西南两区国营工业在去年的恢复改造中也获得了不少成绩。西北区的棉纱及机器工业的主要产品已完成计划，棉纱并超额百分之四。其他如棉布、煤、电等也接近完成。西南区如重庆市二十九厂、五十厂等十余工厂和云南个旧锡矿等，也均提前完成了全年生产任务。
    工业生产方面的所有这些成就，是和人民政府的正确领导与全国工人阶级的努力以及苏联专家的帮助分不开的。美帝国主义和蒋介石残匪曾处心积虑地来破坏我们工业的生产建设工作，但是敌人的这些企图都被粉碎了。全国工人在中央人民政府、中国共产党与工会组织的领导下，参加了工矿管理，并以创造发明、改进技术来积极地提高生产。过去一些依赖国外进口的机器现在已能自造，过去的生产纪录已被打破。在一部分工矿企业中，并开始实行了经济核算制来为国家积累资本和发展生产打下了基础。苏联专家们也以对中国人民崇高的兄弟友谊，献出了他们三十多年来建设社会主义中聚积的经验，来帮助中国工业的恢复。
