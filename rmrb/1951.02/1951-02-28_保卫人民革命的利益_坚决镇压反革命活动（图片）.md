Defend the Interests of the People's Revolution, Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities

    In January 1951, Li Xiutian, a saboteur at the Shijingshan Power Plant, continuously sabotaged power equipment four times within five hours. However, each time he was discovered and immediately stopped by the security team (from left to right: team leader Chu Youcai, team members Song Wenying, Zhang Limin) organized by the plant's workers, who reported it to their superiors, thus solving the case.
    Li Xiutian, a saboteur from Shijingshan, hid a pistol with five bullets in the corner of his home, which was found by comrades from the Security Section of the Shijingshan Power Plant.
    Li Xiutian deliberately opened the water gate of the high-pressure furnace's large water tank, attempting to cause the boiler to explode due to water leakage.
    At 6:30 PM on September 19, 1949, Cao Jinhe, a saboteur at the Shijingshan Power Plant, placed a hand grenade next to the 10,000 KW transformer, attempting to destroy the transformer, but he was apprehended.
    This is after the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea, Yiguandao attempted to coordinate internally and externally, even making American and Kuomintang flags, preparing to welcome American aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek bandits.
    The leaders of Yiguandao extorted gold under the guise of "merit money" and "paying off debts," placing it in specially made cement bricks, with the quantity marked on the surface of the brick. This is a part of the seized gold bricks.
    Yiguandao, a counter-revolutionary and anti-people feudal superstitious organization, under the manipulation of its reactionary leaders, has always colluded with Japanese invaders, traitors, and American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents to carry out various criminal activities of betraying the country and endangering the people. These Canadian pistols, various bullets, silver coins, documents, and a sword given by Chiang Kai-shek are all ironclad evidence of Yiguandao's collusion with Japanese puppets, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and American imperialists to carry out counter-revolutionary and anti-people crimes.
    On September 19, 1950, at the Baoding Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, counter-revolutionary elements were discovered placing a large stone between the wheels of our train, attempting to sabotage railway transportation.
    On September 30, 1950, on the tracks near the North Gate Tower of the Baoding Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, a large stone weighing about 60 kilograms was discovered, placed there by special agents attempting to derail the train and disrupt transportation.
    These counter-revolutionary sabotage activities were all instigated by American imperialism behind the scenes. The picture shows two American special agents dispatched by the US imperialists to China, planning the massacre of the Chinese people with Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent leader Mao Sen (right is bandit leader Mao Sen).
    In addition to carrying out special agent activities in China, American imperialism also uses the notorious rumor-mongering company "Voice of America" to spread slander. In November 1950, Zhou Zuowei, an intelligence special agent for "Voice of America" who was lurking in Shanghai, was apprehended, and three intelligence manuscripts transferred from the "American Consulate General" to "Voice of America" and a twelve-tube shortwave radio used to listen to "Voice of America" spreading rumors were seized.
    On July 11, 1950, the Public Security Bureau of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government and the Public Security Bureau of Benxi City uncovered the "Third Branch of the China International Third Party," an American-Chiang Kai-shek special agent spy organization lurking in Shenyang to gather intelligence and attempt to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "landing and takeover," including the bandit leader Li Ji and 18 others. The picture shows the forged and stolen seals of various agencies and leaders.
    The bandit Yang Shoude sneaked into the capital in 1949 to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After being apprehended in December 1950, detailed military maps were found in the lining of his suitcase.
    Chiang Kai-shek's official seal and a table of organization for the column and battalion were found in the soles of Yang Shoude's leather shoes.
    These are the badges of various Northeast agencies stolen by bandits like Li Ji.
    Feng Qizeng, a key accomplice of Dai Li, the dead special agent leader, sneaked into Shanghai after the liberation of Zhoushan to arrange various conspiracies and sabotage work. He was arrested only ten days after arriving in Shanghai. The picture shows the guns used by Feng Qizeng and others in counter-revolutionary activities.

    保卫人民革命的利益  坚决镇压反革命活动
     一九五一年一月石景山发电厂破坏分子李秀田在五小时内连续破坏发电设备达四次之多，但均为该厂工人组织的安全组（自左至右）组长褚有才、组员宋文英、张立民发现，立即制止并报告上级，因而破案。
    石景山破坏分子李秀田隐藏手枪一枝子弹五发于他家中的墙角下，被石景山发电厂保安科同志搜出。
    李秀田故意将高压炉大水箱水门打开，企图使锅炉因水漏尽而爆炸。
    一九四九年九月十九日下午六时半石景山发电厂破坏分子曹金和将手榴弹一枚放在一万KW变压器旁，企图破坏变压器，结果被我破获。
    这是在美国侵略朝鲜战事发生后，一贯道妄图里应外合，竟制了美国国旗和国民党党旗，准备欢迎美国侵略者和蒋匪帮。
    一贯道的头子们借“功德费”、“了冤欠”等名目敲诈来的黄金，放在特制的洋灰砖里，在砖面上注明数量。这是起获金砖之一部。
    反革命、反人民的封建迷信组织一贯道，在其反动首领操纵下，一向与日寇、汉奸及美蒋特务勾结，进行各种出卖国家、危害人民的罪恶活动。这些加拿大手枪、各种子弹、银圆、文件和蒋介石送的佩剑，都是一贯道与日伪、蒋匪及美帝国主义相勾结，进行反革命、反人民罪行的铁证之一部。
    一九五○年九月十九日京汉路保定站，发现反革命分子在我列车车轮之间按置大石头一块，企图破坏铁路交通。
    一九五○年九月三十日京汉路保定站北闸楼附近的路轨上，发现特务置放一块重约六十公斤的大石头一块，企图颠覆列车，破坏运输。
    这些反革命的破坏活动，都是由美帝国主义在背后策动的。图为由美帝派遣来华的两个美国特务，正在和蒋匪帮特务头子毛森计划屠杀中国人民的勾当（右为匪首毛森）。
    美帝国主义除了在中国进行特务活动外，还利用臭名昭彰的造谣公司“美国之音”进行诬蔑。一九五○年十一月潜伏在上海的“美国之音”情报特务周祚伟被我破获，并抄出由“美国总领事馆”转交“美国之音”的情报底稿三件及用以收听“美国之音”散布谣言的十二灯短波收音机一只。
    一九五○年七月十一日沈阳市人民政府公安局与本溪市公安局破获潜伏沈市刺探情报、妄图配合蒋匪所谓“登陆接收”之美蒋特务间谍组织“中国国际第三党第三支局”匪首李季等十九名。图为伪造和窍取的各机关和首长的印鉴。
    匪犯杨守德于一九四九年潜入首都，进行反革命活动，一九五○年十二月被破获后，在皮箱的夹层中搜出精密的军用地图。
    从杨匪守德皮鞋底内搜出蒋匪的官章及纵队大队编制表。
    这是李季等匪窃取的东北各机关证章。
    死了的特务头子戴笠手下的首要帮凶封匪企曾，于舟山解放后潜来上海，布置各项阴谋及破坏工作，抵沪仅十日即被我逮捕落网。图为封匪企曾等进行反革命活动的枪枝。
