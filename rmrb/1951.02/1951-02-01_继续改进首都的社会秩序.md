Continuing to Improve Social Order in the Capital
    Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau

    Since the liberation of Beijing two years ago, under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and with the active assistance of the broad masses of citizens, the people's public security work has achieved considerable success: destroying the enemy's original counter-revolutionary organizations; thwarting counter-revolutionary sabotage activities; defeating the largest and most reactionary feudal secret society—Yiguandao; basically eliminating bandit activities; severely cracking down on feudal hooligan organizations such as "loubao" (pickpockets), "houche" (railway platform gangs), and "luoche" (market gangs); reducing losses from accidents and fires; establishing a strong people's public security apparatus; safeguarding production and construction; and protecting the safety of the capital's people and their property. A solid social order has been established in the capital.

    What are the specific achievements of our public security work, and what tasks remain for the future? I will describe them below:

            I. On the Work of Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries

    After the liberation of Beijing, although the tangible enemies were eliminated, the intangible enemies still existed. On the one hand, the original enemies were carrying out planned subversion, and on the other hand, the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang continuously sent new spies and special agents to infiltrate the capital. They used various counter-revolutionary social foundations as cover to carry out various sabotage activities, such as collecting intelligence, stealing state secrets; organizing armed rebellions, plotting to subvert the People's Government; arson and explosions, sabotaging production and construction; posing as democratic parties to undermine the united front; printing counterfeit money to disrupt finance; armed robbery; spreading rumors; and writing reactionary slogans, etc.

    The People's Public Security Organs have dealt many blows to these special agents and counter-revolutionary elements. First, in the early stages of entering the city, the enemy's original counter-revolutionary organizations were arrested and registered according to their organizational systems, giving them a devastating blow. Strengthening investigation, arrest and case solving with regard to current activities. In the past two years, many US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent espionage cases have been solved, and many criminals who should be arrested have been arrested. The situation in this regard has been publicized in the past, so I will not repeat it here.

    We dealt with counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the policy of "combining suppression with leniency," that is, "the ringleaders must be dealt with severely, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." First of all, those who held weapons, gathered crowds for rebellion, aimed to overthrow the revolution, killed public officials and people, destroyed and looted state and people's property, stole state secrets, organized espionage and assassination agencies, die-hard special agents and habitual bandits, and the ringleaders who colluded to harbor counter-revolutionary elements were sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment in accordance with the law. Other important special agents and counter-revolutionary elements were sentenced to imprisonment in accordance with the law and subjected to labor reform. General special agents and counter-revolutionary party and league members above the district branch level were placed under control after they registered.

    Many past facts have proved that feudal secret societies are the social foundation of counter-revolution. In particular, Yiguandao, colluded with the enemy to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and has long been hated by the broad masses of citizens. At the request of the broad masses of people, it was explicitly banned at the end of 1950, more than 200 leading members were arrested, more than 5,000 members above the Sancai level were registered, and most of the general followers have awakened after propaganda and education, and have retired from the Dao in large numbers, and asked to return their property. Currently, more than 170,000 people have declared their withdrawal from the Dao. This work is still in progress.

    From the above work, we can see that the People's Public Security Organs are not weak and powerless against counter-revolutionaries. It has the strength and determination to suppress the sabotage activities of all counter-revolutionary elements and crush all counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Doing so is absolutely necessary. It is precisely because of this that the capital of the people and the smooth progress of various production and construction tasks have been protected.

    Before the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is finally eliminated, they will not relax their sabotage of the people's capital. After the old organizations are destroyed, they will inevitably send new special agents to Beijing to carry out sabotage activities, just as in the past. Their activities will be more concealed and more skillful, and there are still some weaknesses in our work, especially the suppression of these elements is not enough, the suppression is not timely, and the combination of specialized agencies and the anti-espionage and anti-special forces work of the broad masses is not close enough. Therefore, the struggle against US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and other counter-revolutionary elements in the future will still be a very complex and tense task. We must improve our skills in fighting against the enemy, rely closely on the masses, and follow the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference which states that "all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other die-hard counter-revolutionary ringleaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause shall be severely punished." Only in this way can all special agents and counter-revolutionary elements be finally and completely eliminated. Only after the special agents and counter-revolutionary elements are eliminated can the social security of the capital be finally guaranteed.

            II. On the Work of Fighting Against Sabotage Elements

    As a result of the enemy's long-term reactionary rule, the broad masses of the people were impoverished and unemployed. Some of them became bandits, hooligans, and thieves; some made a living by improper occupations, such as beggars, prostitutes, and opium and gambling offenders. Since liberation, although many people have changed to legitimate occupations with the education and help of the People's Government, some have not yet awakened and continue to engage in activities that disturb the people. For example, bandit activities were very rampant in the early stages of entering the city, with robberies in broad daylight occurring several times a day; some even beat to death and injured victims and people's police; the loss of people's property in 1949 alone amounted to 1.8 billion yuan. Hooligans such as "loubao," "luoche," and "houche" openly extorted and blackmailed passengers in hotels, stations, markets, and other areas, suppressed legitimate workers, and even conspired to smash the luggage room of the station. Beggars gathered in the streets, forcibly demanding and maliciously begging. More than 400 brothels and more than 1,200 prostitutes became a place to hide dirt and filth. Drug trafficking and gambling were carried out openly, seriously hindering social security.

    In the past two years, in the struggle against these sabotage elements and bad elements, a total of 670 robbery cases have been solved, 806 bandits have been arrested, and stolen goods worth approximately 132,725 jin of millet have been recovered in the second half of 1950 alone; 185 hooligans such as "loubao," "luoche," and "houche" have been arrested; 8,750 thieves have been arrested; 1,809 beggars have been taken in; brothels have been closed; and 3,134 opium and gambling offenders have been arrested.

    Due to the above work, remarkable results have been achieved. Currently, bandit activities have been largely eliminated, and robbery cases have been reduced from dozens a day to one or two a month; the activities of hooligans have been greatly reduced, and they dare not engage in extortion and blackmail openly; and there are no more public prostitutes. However, there are still a few hooligans in various industries and schools who fight, insult women, and theft has not decreased, and the loss of people's property is still large.

    In the future, bandits should be completely eliminated; hooligans should continue to be cracked down; professional thieves should be arrested and subjected to long-term labor reform.

            III. On the Work of Fighting Against Disasters

    Urban population is concentrated, buildings are densely packed, and there are many vehicles, making it easy for traffic accidents, fires, explosions, and other disasters to occur. Therefore, fighting against disasters is an important task of urban public security work. In transportation work, we have rectified stalls, concentrating more than 40,000 stalls scattered on the streets into 13 markets; doubled the number of traffic posts; registered vehicles; examined drivers; revised traffic rules, and carried out publicity and education to the broad masses of people. In the past two years, although the population and vehicles have gradually increased, traffic order has gradually improved. In 1950, traffic accidents decreased by 52% compared with 1949. The number of casualties decreased by 46%. In fire prevention work, we have adopted the principle of prevention first. We have carried out fire prevention publicity and organization work among the broad masses; increased fire-fighting equipment and fire-fighting personnel, and improved fire-fighting technology. Generally, we can arrive at the scene within one or two minutes. The number of disasters in 1950 decreased by 3% compared with 1949. In the work of controlling manufacturers of flammable and explosive materials, although management measures have been promulgated, the enforcement was not strict, and an explosion occurred at the Fuhua Firecracker Factory outside Chaoyangmen in June last year, causing significant losses to people's property. In order to avoid the recurrence of such incidents, all manufacturers of explosive and flammable materials have been ordered to move to the wild, which has now been completed.

    According to the experience of the past two years, traffic accidents are most often caused by military vehicles and official vehicles. In the future, we must strengthen the education of automobile drivers of government agencies and troops. The number of fires has not decreased, so we should strengthen the fire prevention work of the broad masses of citizens and continue to inspect stoves, chimneys, and old wires to reduce the occurrence of fires.

            IV. On Safeguarding Production and Construction

    Production and construction is a very important task for our country, and that is why the enemy tries every possible means to sabotage this aspect. In order to safeguard the capital's production and construction, in the past two years we have arrested and registered counter-revolutionary elements hiding inside the production departments; assisted various departments in establishing many mass safety organizations and various safety and confidentiality systems; and carried out anti-espionage and anti-special forces education for the broad masses of employees, greatly improving their vigilance and giving rise to many factory protection activists. For example, Li Xiutian, a special agent of the Shijingshan Power Plant, colluded with backward elements to sabotage the machine four times in one night, and all were discovered and stopped by safety team members. Chen Boshan and other workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory actively checked machines, stoves, doors, and windows after get off work every day. The above facts show that the broad masses of employees have improved their awareness after education since liberation and have begun to protect their factories with the attitude of masters. Due to the above measures, the gaps in counter-revolutionary sabotage have been eliminated. Since October 1949, although enemy special agents have attempted to sabotage our production and construction several times, they have not succeeded due to strict precautions. At the same time, liability accidents have also decreased compared with the past. The loss of the Chengzi Mine in Mentougou in the second half of last year decreased by 60% compared with the first half of the year. The safety team of the Power Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has united 70% of the workers to participate in factory protection, so there have been no accidents for 200 days.

    But we cannot become complacent because of these achievements. In the future, the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements in the production and construction departments is still a serious task. Currently, there are still some hidden saboteurs in the production departments, and we have also found that many enemy special agents are using our weaknesses to get inside and seek legality. Our investigation and research work is still very shallow, and the truth of many incidents that have occurred has not yet been clarified.

    In order to safeguard economic construction work and prevent sabotage by enemy special agents, in the future, we must further combine specialized security organizations with the broad masses of employees and implement security work among the broad masses of employees. Experience has shown that as long as the broad masses of employees are vigilant, any hidden counter-revolutionary saboteurs can be discovered. Secondly, security work must be combined with production. The idea of simply paying attention to production and ignoring security work, or abstractly talking about security work without combining it with production, is wrong. Third, we must strengthen regular investigation and research work, discover the enemy in a timely manner, and not give the enemy a chance to hide and sabotage.

            V. Building People's Police

    The People's Police are one of the main tools of our people's democratic dictatorship. Like the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police, they belong to the people's armed forces. In the past two years, we have completely smashed the reactionary old police apparatus that oppressed the people and established a people's own public security apparatus that implements dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries and democracy over the people. First of all, a group of leading cadres from the old liberated areas who have been tested and are loyal to the people's cause were put into the ranks of the People's Police, so that the People's Police had strong and reliable leadership. In the past two years, they have gradually become familiar with the situation in the city and have gained some experience in urban public security work. Secondly, we have absorbed a group of outstanding elements from urban workers and revolutionary intellectuals into the ranks of the People's Police, giving the People's Police fresh blood. They have generally shown positive enthusiasm in their work, made rapid progress, and are welcomed by the people. Finally, we conducted strict reviews of the existing personnel and dealt with them separately. Most of those who were retained and educated have turned to the people's side and have played a certain role in maintaining urban security. Experience has proved that the policy adopted by the People's Government to retain them and educate and transform them is correct and necessary. It is precisely because of the fundamental change in the organizational situation that it is possible to complete the above-mentioned tasks of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, severely cracking down on sabotage elements, reducing disasters, and safeguarding production and construction. The work of the past two years has proved that the current People's Police are capable of effectively completing their tasks. After the organizational discipline inspection in the spring of last year and the rectification and study in the autumn, the relationship between the People's Police and the people has become closer. On the one hand, the People's Police care about the people's interests. In the past two years, two of them sacrificed their precious lives and six were injured in the struggle against bandits. When putting out fires, two firefighters were killed and five were injured. When heavy rain caused disasters last summer, houses collapsed everywhere, and many People's Police rescued the people's property day and night, reducing losses for many people. On the other hand, the people also care for and support the People's Police, such as frequently reporting counter-revolutionary and sabotage elements to the People's Police, assisting the People's Police in capturing bandits, and often making many valuable criticisms and suggestions to the police stations, which proves that the people are concerned about the work of the People's Police. The people have been able to recognize from their personal experience that the People's Police serve the revolutionary classes and protect the interests of the majority of the people, which is essentially different from the old police who oppressed the people in the past.

    In order to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, eliminate all sabotage elements, and improve social order in the capital, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the People's Police and build a People's Police team with a high degree of political awareness and familiarity with their work. At present, the quality of the People's Police is not high enough and cannot keep up with the objective requirements. First of all, their political awareness is not high enough, and some people do not have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and they waver in the face of difficulties and serious struggles. Secondly, there are still some impurities in the organization and work style. A small number of dissidents have infiltrated the People's Police team, and there are still some bad work styles such as coercion and command, arrogant attitudes, and showing authority to the people. Although it is individual, it is serious. Third, their business skills are not proficient enough, and they work a lot of time but their efficiency is not very high. Therefore, in the future, it is extremely necessary to strengthen the People's Police team, improve the old, absorb and train the new, and transform the old. Establish a solid political viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly in the People's Police, purge individual counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the People's Police team, as well as those who hold stubborn reactionary ideas and strong Kuomintang work styles and still do not change after repeated education, eliminate all bad work styles that are divorced from the masses, and cultivate a new work style of hard work and loyal service to the people, put the People's Police completely under the supervision of the people, improve their business skills, and complete various public security tasks more quickly and effectively.

    In the past, the broad masses of the city have made great contributions to assisting in the completion of various public security tasks. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks here. In the future, in order to continue to improve social order in the capital, in addition to the efforts of public security personnel themselves, we hope that the broad masses of citizens will pay more attention to and help complete various public security tasks. The task of public security work is to protect the interests of the people, and it must also rely on the people to complete the task. Let us unite with the broad masses of citizens and strive to defeat all enemies and improve social order in the capital.

　　继续改进首都的社会秩序
    北京市人民政府公安局副局长  冯基平
    北京解放两年以来，人民公安工作在中央人民政府及毛主席的英明领导下，在广大市民的积极协助下，获得了不少成就：摧毁了敌人原有的各种反革命组织；粉碎了反革命的阴谋破坏活动；打垮了组织最大最反动的封建道会门——一贯道；基本上消灭了盗匪的活动；严重的打击了搂包、猴车、锣车等封建流氓组织；减少了车祸、火灾等灾害的损失；建设了强有力的人民的公安机构；保卫了生产建设，保卫了首都人民生命财产的安全，首都的社会秩序已经巩固的建立起来了。
    我们在公安工作上各项具体工作的成就是什么，今后还有那些任务，作以下叙述：
            一、关于镇压反革命的工作
    北京解放后，有形的敌人虽被消灭，但无形的敌人却依然存在。一方面是原有的敌人进行有计划的潜伏，另一方面美蒋匪帮不断从外地派遣新的间谍特务潜入首都；他们利用各种反革命的社会基础作掩护，进行了各种破坏活动。如搜集情报，窃取国家机密；组织武装叛乱，阴谋颠覆人民政府；纵火爆炸，破坏生产建设；冒充民主党派，破坏统一战线；印制假钞，扰乱金融，持枪行抢，制造谣言，书写反动标语等等。
    人民公安机关对这些特务反革命分子曾给予了不少的打击。首先在入城初期，将敌人原有的各种反革命组织按其组织系统分别进行了逮捕登记，给予了摧毁性的打击；对现行活动的，加强了侦捕破案。两年来曾破获了许多美蒋特务间谍案件，逮捕了应该逮捕的许多人犯。关于这方面的情况过去已经都公布过了，不再重复去讲。
    对反革命分子，我们依照“镇压与宽大相结合”即“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，分别加以处理。首先对那些手持武器，聚众叛乱，以反革命为目的，杀害公职人员及人民，破坏抢劫国家及人民财物，偷窃国家机密，组织间谍暗杀机关，怙恶不悛的特务惯匪，勾结窝藏反革命分子中的首恶分子，依法处以死刑或长期徒刑。对另外一些重要的特务反革命分子，依法判处徒刑后实行劳动改造。对一般特务及区分部委员以上的反动党团分子在他们登记以后加以管制。
    过去的许多事实证明封建道门是反革命的社会基础。特别是一贯道，勾结敌人进行反革命活动，早为广大市民所痛恨，在广大人民的要求下，于一九五○年底明令取缔，逮捕首要分子二百余名，登记三才以上的分子五千余名，一般道徒经过宣传教育，大部均已省悟，纷纷退道，并要求退回财物，目前声明退道者已有十七万余名。这一工作尚在进行中。
    从以上的工作中可以看到人民公安机关对反革命不是软弱无力的，它有力量和决心镇压一切反革命分子的破坏活动，粉碎一切反革命的阴谋。这样做是完全必要的，正因为这样做了，所以才保卫了人民的首都及各项生产建设工作的顺利进行。
    在美蒋匪帮没有被最后消灭以前，他们是不会放松对人民首都的破坏的；在旧的组织被摧毁以后，他们还必然像过去一样派遣新的特务来京进行破坏活动。其活动方式将会更加隐蔽更加技巧，而我们工作中还存在着某些弱点，特别是对这些分子镇压不够，与镇压不及时，专门机关与广大群众的反奸肃特工作结合的还不密切。故今后同美蒋特务和其他反革命分子的斗争仍然是一个十分复杂十分紧张的工作，必须提高我们对敌斗争的技能，紧紧的依靠群众，按照人民政协共同纲领第七条的规定“严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”。只有这样才能够最后彻底消灭一切特务反革命分子，只有特务反革命分子消灭以后，首都的社会安全才能得到最后的保障。
            二、关于同破坏分子作斗争的工作
    由于敌人长期反动统治的结果，造成广大人民的贫困与失业；其中有的沦为盗匪、流氓、小偷；有的靠不正当职业为生，如乞丐、妓女、烟赌犯等。解放以来，虽有不少人在人民政府的教育帮助下，改从正当职业；但还有一部分仍未觉悟，继续进行扰害人民的活动。如在入城初期盗匪活动甚为猖獗，白昼行抢，一日数起；甚而打死打伤事主及人民警察；人民财产损失仅在一九四九年即达十八亿元之多。搂包、锣车、猴车等流氓分子，在旅店、车站、市场等地区，公开对旅客敲诈勒索，压迫正当工人，甚至阴谋砸毁车站行李房。乞丐聚集街头，强索恶讨。妓院四百余户，妓女一千二百余人，成为藏污纳垢之所。贩毒、赌博公开进行，严重的妨害了社会治安。
    两年以来在与这些破坏分子、不良分子的斗争上，共破获六百七十起抢劫案，逮捕盗匪八百零六名，仅一九五○年后半年追回约值小米十三万二千七百二十五斤的赃物；逮捕搂包、锣车、猴车等流氓分子一百八十五名；抓捕小偷八千七百五十名；收容乞丐一千八百零九名；封闭了妓院；逮捕烟赌犯三千一百三十四名。
    由于上述工作的进行，已收到了显著的效果；目前盗匪活动已大体肃清，抢劫案由每日十数起减少到每月一、二起；流氓分子的活动已大为减少，不敢再明目张胆的进行敲诈勒索；公开妓女已经没有了。但是在各种行业及学校中，仍存在着少数流氓分子，打架斗殴，侮辱妇女；偷窃事件并未减少，人民财产的损失仍然很多。
    今后应彻底肃清盗匪；继续打击流氓分子；抓捕职业小偷，长期劳动改造。
            三、关于同灾害作斗争的工作
    城市人口集中，建筑林立，车辆众多，易有车祸、火灾、爆炸等灾害发生。故与灾害斗争为城市公安工作一项重要任务。在交通工作上，我们曾整顿了摊贩，将四万多散布在街头的摊贩集中于十三个市场；增设了一倍以上的交通岗位；登记了车辆；考试了司机；修改了交通规则，对广大人民群众进行了宣传教育。两年以来，虽然人口车辆逐渐增多，但交通秩序已逐渐改善；一九五○年车祸较一九四九年减少了百分之五十二。伤亡人数减少百分之四十六。在防火工作上，我们采取了以预防为主的方针。在广大群众中进行了防火宣传与组织的工作；增设了消防器材与消防人员，提高了消防技术，一般的在一两分钟以内即能到达现场，一九五○年的成灾数字较一九四九年减少了百分之三。在管制易燃物、爆炸物的厂商工作上，虽然颁布了管理办法，但因执行不严，去年六月，朝阳门外辅华火药厂曾发生了爆炸事件，使人民财产遭受了重大损失。为避免再度发生这类事件，曾限令所有爆炸物、易燃物厂商迁移在野外，现已全部完成。
    根据两年来的经验，交通肇事以军车、公用车为最多，今后必须加强对机关部队汽车司机的教育。火灾的发生次数仍未减少，应加强广大市民的防火工作，继续检查炉灶、烟筒及破旧电线，以减少火灾的发生。
            四、关于保卫生产建设
    生产建设是我们国家十分重要的工作，正因为如此，所以敌人才千方百计的向着这个方面进行破坏。为保卫首都的生产建设，两年来我们逮捕与登记管制了隐藏在生产部门内部的反革命分子；协助各部门建立了许多群众性的安全组织及各种安全保密制度；并对广大职工进行了防奸反特教育，大大提高了他们的警惕性，涌现出许多护厂积极分子。如石景山发电厂特务分子李秀田勾结落后分子一夜破坏机器四次，均被安全组员发觉制止；华北农业机器厂工人陈博山等，每天下班后主动检查机器、火炉、门窗等。以上事实说明解放后广大职工经过教育觉悟提高了，开始以主人翁的态度保护自己的工厂。由于以上的措施，杜绝了反革命的破坏空隙，自从一九四九年十月以来，敌特分子虽然几次企图破坏我生产建设，但由于防范谨严，未能得逞；同时责任事故也较以往减少了。门头沟城子矿去年后半年损失比前半年减少百分之六十，石景山钢铁厂动力部安全组因为团结了百分之七十的工人参加护厂，因此已有二百天未发生任何事故。
    但我们不能因为有了这些成就而产生松懈麻痹，今后在生产建设部门中与反革命分子进行斗争，仍然是一个严重的任务，目前在生产部门内还有一些潜伏的阴谋破坏分子，我们也发现有很多敌特分子利用我们的弱点，钻进内部，求得合法。而我们的调查研究工作还很不深入，许多已发生的事件尚未查清真象。
    为了保卫经济建设工作，防止敌特破坏，今后必须更进一步把专门保卫组织与广大员工相结合起来，将保卫工作贯彻到广大员工中去。经验证明，只要广大员工警惕起来，任何隐藏的反革命破坏分子都是可以被发现出来的。其次是保卫工作必须与生产相结合，单纯注意生产而忽视保卫工作，或抽象的谈保卫工作而不与生产结合起来的思想都是错误的。第三必须加强经常的调查研究工作，及时的发现敌人，不给敌人隐藏破坏的机会。
            五、建设人民警察
    人民警察是我们人民民主专政的国家政权的主要工具之一，它和人民解放军，人民公安部队一样，同是属于人民的武力，两年来，我们彻底打碎了压迫人民的反动的旧的警察机构，建立了对反革命实行专政对人民实行民主的人民自己的公安机构。首先投入了一批由老区来的经过考验忠实于人民事业的领导骨干到人民警察队伍中来，使人民警察有了坚强的可靠的领导，两年来他们逐渐的熟悉了城市的情况，有了一些城市公安工作的经验。其次，我们从城市工人，革命知识分子中吸收了一批优秀的分子到人民警察队伍中来，使人民警察有了新鲜的血液，他们在工作中普遍的表现积极热情，进步很快，为人民所欢迎。最后对旧有人员进行严格的审查，分别处理，留用下来的经过改造教育，大部分均已转到人民方面来，对维护城市治安起了一定的作用，经验证明了人民政府所采取的留用他们并加以教育改造的政策是正确的与必要的。正由于组织情况的根本改变，所以才能够完成以上所讲坚决镇压反革命，严厉打击破坏分子，减少灾害，保卫生产建设各项任务。过去两年来的工作证明现在的人民警察是能够有效的完成任务的。人民警察经过去年春季组织纪律检查与秋季的整风学习，与人民群众的关系更加密切了，一方面民警关心人民利益，两年来在与盗匪斗争中曾有二名牺牲了自己宝贵的生命，六名受伤，在扑救火灾时曾有消防警二人牺牲，五人受伤，去年夏天霪雨成灾时，到处房屋倒塌，许多民警不分昼夜，抢救群众财物，使许多人民减少了损失；另方面人民对民警也是爱护与支持的，如经常向民警检举反革命及破坏分子，协助民警捕捉盗匪，常向派出所提出许多宝贵的批评与建议，足证人民对民警的工作是关心的。人民从切身的体验中已能认清了人民警察是为各革命阶级服务的，是保护大多数人民利益的，与过去压迫人民的旧警察有本质的不同。
    为了坚决镇压反革命，肃清一切破坏分子，改进首都的社会秩序，今后还必须加强人民警察的工作，建设一支有高度政治觉悟熟悉业务的人民警察队伍，目前人民警察的质量不够高，还赶不上客观的要求，首先是他们的政治觉悟不够高，个别的人没有全心全意为人民服务的思想，在困难关头与严重斗争的时候就动摇了，其次在组织上及作风上还有若干不纯，在人民警察队伍中有少数异己分子混入，强迫命令，态度蛮横，向人民耍权威等恶劣作风仍有存在，虽是个别的但是严重的。第三、业务技术不够熟练，工作时间很多而效率不十分高，因此今后极须加强人民警察的队伍，提高老的，吸收和培养新的，改造旧的。在人民警察中建立起巩固的全心全意为人民服务的政治观点，清洗个别隐藏在人民警察队伍中的反革命分子，以及抱着顽固的反动思想及浓厚国民党作风经再三教育仍旧不改的分子，肃清一切脱离群众的坏作风，养成艰苦奋斗忠心为人民服务的新作风，将人民警察完全置于人民的监督之下，提高业务技术，更加迅速和有效的完成各项公安工作的任务。
    过去本市广大群众对协助完成各项公安任务上供献了很大的力量，我们在这里表示衷心的感谢，今后为了继续改进首都的社会秩序，除了公安人员本身努力提高外，希望广大市民更多的关心与帮助各项公安任务的完成。公安工作的任务是保护人民的利益，同时也必须依靠人民才能完成任务，让我们与广大市民团结一起，为战胜一切敌人改进首都社会秩序而奋斗。
