　　Reduction of Fuping Primary Schools Causes Public Dissatisfaction
    Suggestions for the Government to Implement a Public-Private Partnership Method
    I recently returned to my hometown (Fuping County, Hebei Province). Because I worked in education in this county for two years, I paid close attention to it. As far as I know, in the past year, due to the particularly difficult local finances, the number of primary schools in the county has been reduced by almost one-third (some of which were merged, but most were cancelled), and many higher primary schools have also been closed. As a result, the vast majority of farmers' children have not only lost the opportunity to enter higher primary school, but even the opportunity to enter primary school. This has caused dissatisfaction among many farmers.
    I have the following opinions on this issue for reference:
    First, according to the spirit of public-private partnership, if the local government is really unable to uniformly solve all education funds, it can mobilize the masses to raise funds for education. As long as this method is explained to the masses well, the masses are not only willing but also have the power to solve the problem of their children's schooling.
    Second, in highly dispersed mountainous areas, mixed primary schools for adults and children can be established in combination with farmer education.
    Third, in addition to concentrating efforts to run regular complete primary schools or senior classes in major market towns, non-regular senior classes or senior groups should be supplemented in more remote areas. This approach is very necessary for mountainous areas with poor land, poor people, and high dispersion.
    Fourth, education work, especially education work in mountainous areas, is indeed an arduous and glorious task. Therefore, in addition to providing as much care as possible to the majority of primary school teachers under economically permissible conditions, we must strengthen unity and education politically to enable them to establish the concept of serving the people's education, in order to overcome the current phenomenon that some teachers are not at ease with rural education work and are flowing to cities.

    Editor's note: Comrade Fan Guoguang's opinions on developing education in mountainous areas and the public-private partnership method of running schools are worthy of promotion in the current situation of relatively difficult national economy. However, the public-private partnership method must adhere to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. Government education departments should provide good assistance. It is not allowed to force the masses to run schools through disguised apportionment or orders; nor should we ignore the demands of the masses who are enthusiastic about running schools.

### 阜平小学减少引起群众不满  建议政府实行民办公助办法

　　阜平小学减少引起群众不满
    建议政府实行民办公助办法
    我最近回家乡（河北省阜平县）一次。因为我曾在本县做过二年教育工作，所以对此就比较留心。据我了解，本县近一年来，由于地方经费特别困难，小学几乎减少了三分之一（其中除部分合并外，大部是取消了），高小也停办了不少。这样，广大农民子弟不但失去了入高小的机会，甚至入小学的机会也没有了。因此引起不少农民的不满。
    对于这个问题我有如下的意见，提供参考：
    第一，根据民办公助的精神，当地政府如果实在无力统一解决全部教育经费，可发动群众集资兴学。只要很好的向群众说明这个办法，群众不但愿意而且是有力量来解决自己子弟入学问题的。
    第二，在高度分散的山地可结合农民教育设立成年与儿童的混合小学。
    第三，除应集中力量办好主要集镇的正规完小或高级班外，在比较偏僻的地方，应该辅之以非正规的高级班或高级组。这种作法对于地瘠民贫、高度分散的山地是十分需要的。
    第四，教育工作尤其是山地的教育工作，的确是一个艰苦而又光荣的任务。因此，对广大小学教员，除在经济条件许可的情况下，应尽量予以照顾外，必须在政治上加强团结教育，使其建立为人民教育事业服务的观点，以克服目前部分教员不安心农村教育工作，而向城市流动的现象。
                                中共石家庄地委宣传部  范国光
    编者按：范国光同志对于开展山地教育工作所提的意见及民办公助的办学方法，在目前国家经济比较困难的情况下，是值得提倡的。但是，民办公助的办法，必须坚持群众自愿的原则。政府教育部门应给以很好的帮助。既不容许以变象的摊派、命令的方式来强迫群众办学；也不应该对热心办学的群众要求漠视不管。
