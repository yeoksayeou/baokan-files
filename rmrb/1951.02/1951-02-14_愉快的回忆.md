　　Pleasant Memories
    P. Dubrovina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic
    The entire Soviet people will commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the treaty between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Every Soviet person is filled with blessings, love, and respect for their friend—the Chinese people.
    I am fortunate to have been in China during the days when the Chinese people celebrated their victories. I recall the mass rallies attended by tens of millions of people, the festive parades, and the joyous meetings we had with our Chinese friends—workers, peasants, intellectuals, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. This was almost a year and a half ago, but the clear impressions left by what I witnessed have not faded, and I believe they will never fade. On this significant day of the first anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, I see again those Chinese children gathered in a school in Tianjin, eager to learn about the work of the Soviet Young Pioneers and to discuss the establishment of their own children's organizations. I remember these children with their passionate eyes, singing the national anthem of the free People's Republic of China.
    I remember the 350,000-strong rally to defend peace held in Tianjin. How righteously and powerfully the call for peace was voiced from the rostrum of the conference! How happy we were to realize that such a powerful force was on the same front as us, the Soviet Union, fighting for peace against warmongers!
    I remember the mass rally held by Chinese peasants in Bagou Village near Beijing, who movingly presented us with many gifts for Comrade Stalin—exquisitely embroidered white tablecloths made by their own hands, large plates filled with peanuts, lotus roots, and shoes skillfully woven from straw.
    I recall the meeting with the soldiers of the Third Field Army in Shanghai, and I also recall those heroes—soldiers and officers—who gave us the combat medal for the People's Liberation Army's crossing of the Yangtze River as a lasting memento.
    I remember the many meetings with Chinese teachers, and I also remember their questions, which demonstrated their great interest in the experience of Soviet cultural construction and their eagerness to take this experience into account in the construction of the new China.
    The Soviet people are watching with respect and joy the democratic reforms in China and the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are bravely fighting shoulder to shoulder with their brothers—the courageous Korean people.
    Interest in the life of free China is growing in our Soviet Union—Chinese films are being shown in the Soviet Union, the works of Chinese writers are being translated into Russian and printed in large quantities, chapters on China in general school and university textbooks are being expanded, and Chinese exhibitions and performances by Chinese actors in the Soviet Union are achieving great success. And the more deeply we know the Chinese people, the more intimate our indestructible friendship and feelings of mutual understanding become.
    Long live the consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship! Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people! Long live Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the greatest leader of all mankind!

　　愉快的回忆
    俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义联邦共和国教育部副部长　Π·杜伯洛维娜
    全体苏维埃人民将纪念苏联与中华人民共和国间签订条约的一周年纪念日。每一个苏维埃人，心中都充满着对于自己的朋友——中国人民的祝福、热爱和尊敬。
    我很幸运，我曾在中国人民庆祝他们所取得的胜利的日子里，到过中国。我回想起有千万人参加的群众大会，回想起节日的游行，回想起我们同中国朋友们——工人、农民、知识分子、人民解放军战士们的人山人海的欢愉的会见。这是差不多一年半以前的事了，但是，我所目睹留下的清晰印象却并没有消逝，而且我相信它是永远不会消逝的。在中苏条约一周年的意义重大的日子里，我重又看到那些中国儿童们，他们为了要知道苏联少先队的工作，要谈说建设他们自己的儿童组织，而集合在天津的一所学校里。我记得这些有着热情的眼睛、唱着自由的中华人民共和国国歌的孩子们。
    我记得在天津举行的有三十五万人参加的保卫和平的大会。当时从大会讲台上是如何正直地、有力地发出了和平号召啊！当意识到有这样一支强大的力量和我们苏联在一条战线上共同进行争取和平反对战争挑拨者的斗争时，我们是多么高兴啊！
    我记得北京近郊巴沟村中国农民所举行的群众大会，这些农民令人感动地交给我们许多赠给斯大林同志的礼物——他们亲手精致刺绣的白桌布、装满花生的大盘子、莲藕以及用稻草精巧编成的鞋子。
    我回忆起在上海和第三野战军战士们的相会，我也回忆起那些英雄们——战士们和军官们，他们将中国人民解放军强渡长江的战斗奖章赠给我们作永久的纪念。
    我记得和中国教师们的多次相会，我也记得他们的问题，这些问题证明着他们对于苏联文化建设的经验有着巨大的兴趣，并热望在新中国建设中顾及到这种经验。
    苏维埃人民正怀着尊敬和欢欣，注视着中国的民主改革，注视着中国人民志愿军的英雄作为，他们正在和自己的弟兄——勇敢的朝鲜人民英勇地并肩作战。
    我们苏联国内对于自由中国的生活的兴趣在日益增长——在苏联放映着中国电影，中国作家的作品被译成俄文并大量印行，一般学校和高等学校教科书中论及中国的篇章都加扩充，在苏联的中国的展览会和中国演员们的演出都获得巨大的成功。而我们认识中国人民愈是深刻，我们的不朽友谊和互相了解的感情就愈是亲切。
    中苏友好巩固万岁！中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！中国人民最好的朋友，苏维埃人民及全人类最伟大的领袖斯大林同志万岁！
