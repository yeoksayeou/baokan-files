Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: The People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region, on the 19th of this month, in Haizi, north of the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province and at the intersection of Gansu and Qinghai Provinces, captured the American imperialist armed agent and bandit leader Osman, who was deeply hated by the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest. In this battle, the People's Liberation Army captured over a hundred of Osman's accomplices, including Jialabo.

Osman was a Kazakh, a rogue and habitual bandit from the Keloyi tribe in Fuyun County, Altay Prefecture, Xinjiang Province. In 1946, Osman joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and was appointed as a member of the pseudo-Xinjiang Provincial Government and Commissioner of Altay Prefecture. Subsequently, with the support of Song Xilian, the Kuomintang Xinjiang Garrison Commander, Osman openly attacked the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay districts, opposing the revolutionary war waged by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for liberation. In July 1948, Osman in Dihua accepted the leadership of Mark Lynam, a spy and former U.S. Vice-Consul in Dihua, and colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's agents Janim Khan, Aisa, and Emin. In September 1949, after the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, Mark Lynam supplied Osman with gold, guns, ammunition, and other materials, ordering him to continue the unrest. After March last year, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang carried out repeated suppression and political disintegration work against Osman's bandits in the vast area of 2,000 li from Changji in the west to Zhenxi in the east, from Hami in the south to Beitashan in the north. They successively won over 20,000 Kazakh people who had been coerced by Osman and others, and captured the bandit leader Janim Khan alive. Osman and another bandit leader, Yaolebos, escaped with only 200 remaining bandits, fleeing to the Qilian Mountains on the border of Gansu and Qinghai, and continued their anti-people criminal activities. However, under the heroic encirclement and suppression by our bandit suppression troops and the support of the people of all ethnic groups, Osman was finally captured.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The People's Court of Dihua Municipal People's Government held a public trial on the 4th of this month, sentenced the American imperialist armed spy Janim Khan to death, and executed him by firing squad on the same day.

　　西北我军生擒匪首乌斯满
    迪化举行公审枪决贾尼木汗
    【新华社兰州电】人民解放军西北军区某部，于本月十九日在青海省柴达木盆地以北、甘青两省交界的海子，一举生擒为西北各民族人民痛恨入骨的美帝国主义武装特务乌斯满匪首。是役人民解放军活捉乌匪帮凶加拉伯以下百余人。
    乌斯满匪首为哈萨克族人，是新疆省阿山区富蕴县克洛依部落的流氓惯匪。一九四六年乌匪投靠蒋介石匪帮并被委任为伪新疆省府委员兼阿山区专员。随后，乌匪即在国民党新疆警备总司令宋匪希濂的支持下，公开进攻伊犁、塔城、阿山三区，反对新疆各民族人民为求解放而进行的革命战争。一九四八年七月，乌匪在迪化接受了前美国驻迪化副领事间谍分子马克南的领导，和蒋匪特务贾尼木汗、艾沙、伊敏等匪结伙。一九四九年九月，新疆和平解放后，马克南又接济了乌匪黄金、枪枝、弹药等，令其继续骚乱。去年三月以后，驻新疆的人民解放军在西起昌吉、东至镇西、南起哈密、北至北塔山的两千华里的广大地区内，对乌斯满股匪进行了反复清剿与政治瓦解的工作，先后争取了被乌匪等胁走的两万哈萨克族人民来归，并活捉了匪首贾尼木汗。乌匪与另一匪首尧乐博斯仅率残匪二百人漏网脱逃，窜至甘肃青海交界的祁连山中，继续进行反人民的罪恶活动。但在我剿匪部队英勇的围剿和各民族人民的支援下，乌匪终于就擒。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：迪化市人民政府人民法庭于本月四日举行公审，判处美帝国主义武装间谍分子贾尼木汗死刑，并于同日执行枪决。
