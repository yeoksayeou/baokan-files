    The basic task of the Association in 1951 is to further strengthen and develop the work and organization of the Association on the basis of the work done last year; to promptly refute the enemy's reactionary propaganda against the Soviet Union and undermining Sino-Soviet friendship and unity, to raise the Chinese people's understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship, and to fundamentally clarify the various doubts in the minds of the masses regarding Sino-Soviet relations; at the same time, to further promote the exchange of wisdom and experience between the people of China and the Soviet Union, to advance the construction of our country, and to further enhance the great fighting friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend world peace.
    Based on the above tasks, the following main tasks are planned for 1951:
