　　American Youth Refuse to Be Cannon Fodder
　  Over Seven Thousand Dodge the Draft
    【Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 25th】According to a report by Electric News Agency, New York, February 22nd: A large number of American youths are evading military service, refusing to serve as cannon fodder for aggression. To this end, the U.S. government has had to order a nationwide search for those conscripted youths who have not reported. U.S. Deputy Attorney General, Kennethston, has issued summonses from Los Angeles, California, and will arrest 116 people in Southern California alone. The government is extremely secretive about the number of draft dodgers, but it is estimated that the total number is about 7,500. Kennethston revealed that many young people falsely claim to be homosexual to seek exemption from service, and many others have crossed the border and fled to Mexico. The Chicago Draft Board in Illinois reported that in November of last year alone, 1,056 people evaded military service.
    A twenty-five-year-old engineer in Los Angeles, Koqu Ning, said that he would rather sit in jail for four years than serve in a war he could not accept. He listed three conditions in court under which he would be willing to serve, saying: "We must be absolutely and undoubtedly fighting for freedom, justice and humanity, without any form of private or national secret motives for profit. We must have completely sincerely and truly exhausted all possible peaceful means and continue to keep the door open to peace. We must truly be in a situation of being attacked." He said: Because these conditions are not met, "therefore, I must now oppose military service, otherwise, I would be violating my conscience, betraying my religious beliefs and democratic ideals, and betraying my American compatriots."

　　美国青年拒绝当炮灰
　  逃避兵役的约达七千多人
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社纽约二十二日讯：美国青年大批逃避兵役，拒绝充当侵略炮灰。为此，美国政府已不得不下令在全国搜捕那些没有报到的被征青年。美国司法部副部长肯尼斯顿已自加利福尼亚州洛杉矶发出传票，单单在该州南部就要拘捕一百一十六人。政府对逃避兵役的人数保守极端秘密，但据估计总数约达七千五百人。肯尼斯顿透露：许多青年人伪称同性恋爱而要求免役，还有许多人越过边界逃到墨西哥去了。伊利诺斯州芝加哥的征兵处报告，仅在去年十一月一个月，逃避兵役的就有一千零五十六人。
    洛杉矶一个二十五岁的工程师科区宁表示，他宁愿坐四年监牢，也不愿在他所不能接受的战争中服役。他在法庭上列举了他愿意服役的三个条件说：“我们必须是绝对地毫无疑问地为自由、正义与人道而战，没有任何形式的私人或国家从中取利的秘密动机。我们必须完全诚意地真正试尽了一切可能的和平办法而且继续敞开着和平之门。我们必须是真正处在被进攻的情况下。”他说：因为这些条件不具备，“所以，我现在必须反对兵役，否则，我就是违背了我的良心，背叛我的宗教信仰和民主思想，也就是对不起我的美国同胞”。
