　　We Will Not Allow the Dark Days to Return
　  ——A Chinese Overseas Condemnation of U.S. Imperialism Arming Japan
　　Wang Jinding
    A little over a month ago, a female overseas Chinese student came to see me. She was very excited and said that she had been approved to join a military cadre school and might be leaving in a day or two to study the navy. My understanding of this student was not extensive. In Singapore, I only knew that she was a progressive student. After arriving in Beijing, she entered school, hoping to contribute to the future cultural construction of New China. However, now she is leaving school to join the army. So I asked her about her motivation for joining the army. When I mentioned her family, she seemed reluctant to say much, only briefly mentioning that her father had disappeared during the "Great Inspection" by the Japanese fascists in Singapore in 1942, and now only her mother was left at home, living a very miserable life.
    We were silent for a long time, and an uncontrollable grief and indignation made me recall the dark period of the Japanese fascist occupation of Malaya and Indonesia. Although the exact number of overseas Chinese who were killed in that inspection is not yet known, the figure of around 100,000 is considered relatively credible. Most of them were collectively tied up and taken to the seaside, where they were sacrificed in a burst of gunfire from the enemy. And during the trial of war criminals at the Victoria Memorial Hall, I also heard a victimized compatriot accuse the enemy of forcing them to dig their own graves and burying themselves alive.
    I heard that a female classmate I knew well disguised herself in men's clothing at that time because she was worried about being insulted by the enemy, but as a result, she was discovered by the enemy, who stripped her of all her clothes and forced her to kneel on the main road of Beach Road. After that, this female classmate went into the jungle and joined the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army.
    I cannot forget the fires that burned in the Little Slope area when it was bombed by enemy planes, and the heart-wrenching cries of mothers and children who were fleeing for their lives in that fire. However, after the bombing and massacre, almost all the assets of the overseas Chinese in Malaya were plundered by the Japanese bandits under the name of "contributions." It is well known that the rubber produced in Malaya and Indonesia accounts for about 80% of the world's total output, but at that time it was difficult for people to buy even a bicycle tire. In some villages in eastern and western Sumatra that I passed through, most farmers even had difficulty wearing a pair of shorts in 1944. People initially wore sacks, then used so-called "bark cloth" to wrap themselves, and finally even bark cloth became too expensive to buy. No matches, no soap, no nails, no paper, this area, usually known as blessed by nature, was plundered by the Japanese fascists until it had nothing left. Schools were banned unless they were opened to educate children to accept enslavement. Many outstanding intellectuals suffered brutal persecution. I remember an Indonesian female teacher telling me that her husband was imprisoned in a concentration camp, her daughter escaped to an unknown location, and she herself was driven out of her home by the Japanese military police. She did not leave the city where she lived, and she still passed by her own door every day. The curtains that she had personally hung were still fluttering in the wind; but sitting at the table by the window, drinking alcohol, were those Japanese bandits. She said that the persecution of Indonesians was so varied and indescribable that it was especially difficult to ask Indonesians like her not to oppose Japanese fascism.
    The fate of oppressed nations is the same. And what excites me the most is that I knew that our excellent sons and daughters of overseas Chinese who were unwilling to be slaves entered the primitive wilderness, took up weapons, organized their own armies, and carried out a resolute struggle against Japanese fascism.
    Linking all these memories to the female classmate with a painful experience sitting in front of me, it is easy for me to understand why she joined the army.
    "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" Her face, which usually showed a smile, looked very serious when she said this. We parted, and I sent her out the door. I felt as if her fading figure was slowly growing bigger in front of my eyes. The sky was so clear, and the sun shone on the wide road, making people feel like going forward. I looked at the dazzling city tower of Di'anmen, and the clear blue sky behind Jingshan. In this great, free people's capital, while we are engaged in building sewers and widening roads, the U.S. imperialists are pouring tens of thousands of tons of bombs and gasoline on the peaceful towns and villages of Korea, turning them into ruins. What I can never forget is the procession of tens of thousands of children in white shirts and red scarves passing through Tiananmen Square on National Day last year. When they passed in front of their great and wise leader, they all raised the pigeons and flowers in their hands and shouted, "Defend peace, oppose wars of aggression." Yes, the people of China, like the people of the world, need peace because we have a future, because we want to build our motherland more prosperous, more beautiful, and more cultured.
    We love our motherland because we are a country with a long history and culture. No country in the world has suffered feudal oppression as long as we have, and no country can have as many farmers as we do who have turned themselves around. We have driven out the imperialists who have been trampling on our heads for a hundred years, and we will never allow the dark days of the past to return.

### 我们不允许黑暗日子重新回头——一个华侨为反对美帝武装日本的控诉

　　我们不允许黑暗日子重新回头
　  ——一个华侨为反对美帝武装日本的控诉
　　汪金丁
    一个多月以前，一位华侨女同学跑来看我，她非常兴奋地说是已经被批准参加军事干部学校，可能就在一两天之内离开，是准备学习海军去的。我对这位同学的了解，本来不多，在新加坡时，只知道她是个进步的同学，到北京后，她进了学校，是想在新中国未来的文化建设上成为一个有所贡献的人材。然而，现在她却离开学校参军去了。我于是问到她参军的动机，谈起她的家庭，她仿佛不想多说什么，只简单提到一九四二年日本法西斯占领新加坡的“大检证”时，她的父亲便一去不返，家里现在只剩下母亲，生活相当凄苦。
    我们相对沉默了好久，有一种难以抑制的悲愤，使我回想到日本法西斯占领马来亚和印尼的黑暗时期。那次被检遇害的华侨，虽然现在还没有确实的数目，但是十万左右，却是比较可信的。他们大多是被集体地绑到海边，在敌人的一阵乱枪声中牺牲的。而在维多利亚纪念堂上审讯战犯的时候，我还听到过一位被难的侨胞，控诉敌人是怎样强迫他们自己掘坑，活埋自己。
    我曾听说是我相熟的一位女同学，那时因为耽心受到敌人的侮辱而穿着男装，可是结果被敌人发现，就把她全身的衣服剥掉，强迫跪在美芝纬的大马路上。那以后，这位女同学走进山芭参加马来亚的人民抗日军去了。
    我不能忘记小坡一带被敌机轰炸时焚烧起来的大火，以及在那大火中逃避无路的母亲们和孩子们的震人心魄的哭喊。然而轰炸和屠杀过去了，跟着的是马来亚华侨所有的资产又在“奉纳金”的名义之下，几乎全部被日本强盗劫掠而去。人所共知，马来亚和印尼出产的树胶，约占全世界产量的百分之八十，然而人们当时却难买到一条脚踏车的外带。我所经过的苏门答腊东部和西部的一些乡村，那里大多数的农民到一九四四年连穿一条短裤也是很困难的了，人们起先是穿麻袋，过后是用所谓“树皮布”裹身，最后连树皮布也贵得买不起了。没有火柴，没有肥皂，没有钉子，没有纸，这个平时称为得天独厚的地区，却被日本法西斯掠夺到一无所有。学校被封禁，除非开起来让孩子们接受奴化的教育。许多优秀的文化人遭遇到野蛮的迫害。我记得有位印尼的女教师和我谈起，她的丈夫被关进集中营，女儿逃避到不知去向，而她自己也被日本宪兵赶出了家。她并没有离开自己所住的城市，每天她还从自己的家门口经过，那曾由她亲手挂起的窗帷，依旧随风飘动；但是坐在窗下桌旁饮酒的，却是那些日本强盗。她说印尼人被迫害的情况是形形色色说不尽的，因而要叫像她一样的印尼人不反对日本法西斯，也就特别困难了。
    被压迫民族的命运是一样的。而我最感兴奋的，是我曾知道我们那些不愿做奴隶的华侨优秀儿女，他们走进了原始蛮荒的森林，拿起了武器，组织了自己的军队，向日本法西斯进行坚决的斗争。
    把这一切的回忆联系到坐在我面前的这位有着惨痛遭遇的女同学，对于她为什么参军，我是很容易体会出来的。
    “血债必须用同物偿还！”她那常是流露着微笑的面孔，在说这话时显得很严肃。我们分手了，我把她送出大门。我仿佛觉得她那渐去渐远的影子，在我眼前慢慢大起来。天是那样的晴朗，阳光照在宽阔的马路上，使人感到一往无前。我望着地安门耀眼的城楼，望着景山后面一碧如洗的晴空，在这伟大的自由的人民的首都，当我们正在从事修筑下水道和加宽马路的时候，美帝国主义者却把几万吨炸弹和汽油，倾倒在朝鲜的和平城镇与乡村，把那里变成了废墟。我永久不能忘记的是：在去年国庆日走过天安门前的那些穿白衫、系红领巾的成千成万的儿童的队伍，当他们走过自己伟大英明的领袖的面前时，一齐举起了手中的鸽子和鲜花，他们高呼着保卫和平、反对侵略战争。是的，全中国的人民正像全世界的人民一样需要和平，因为我们有前途，因为我们要把自己的祖国建设得更富裕、更美丽、更有文化。
    我们热爱自己的祖国，因为我们是一个有着悠久的历史和文化的国家，全世界没有一个国家受封建的压迫像我们忍受的那么久，没有一个国家能像我们有那么多人口的农民翻了身，我们已经把一百年来踏在我们头上的帝国主义赶走了，我们决不允许过去的黑暗的日子重新回头。
