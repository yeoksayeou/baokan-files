　　Victorious Meeting
    A Record of the Meeting Between Our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean Guerrillas
　　Ma Ji
    One night in December of last year, at three o'clock, a battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers, braving heavy wind and snow, advanced towards the 38th parallel in Kangwon Province, central Korea, and entered a village to bivouac. Suddenly, five Korean youths ran out of the village. As soon as they discovered that it was the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they rushed forward and cheered, lifting several soldiers up. They pointed at themselves and said, "We are the Kim Il-sung Guerrillas." At this time, almost all the men, women, and children in the village poured out. Chinese and Korean People's soldiers shook hands and embraced each other, shouting "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Kim Il-sung!" in the dark. The guerrillas and villagers busily brushed the snowflakes off the soldiers, and without any explanation, ushered them into their houses.
    The political instructor of the guerrilla unit began to communicate in writing with the deputy battalion commander of our Chinese People's Volunteers. The instructor wrote: "You eat, we'll cook." The deputy battalion commander replied: "You are short of food, we will cook for ourselves." After reading this, the instructor wrote "No, no, no" three times on the paper. Even as they were communicating in writing, the guerrillas had already started cooking for the Volunteers, and the Volunteer soldiers could not stop them.
    After the meal, the Korean male and female guerrillas took out their own cotton-padded clothes and quilts for the soldiers to sleep under. Both sides offered and declined, deferring to each other for a long time. After the soldiers lay down to sleep, the cotton-padded clothes and quilts were all piled on them. The soldiers deeply felt the boundless warmth of the Korean comrades.
    The next afternoon, the remote little village was filled with singing and laughter. Chinese and Korean People's soldiers sat together in groups of three or five, taking turns singing Chinese and Korean songs.
    In the evening, the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers held a joint celebration, introducing each other to the revolutionary struggles of the two peoples. The commander of the guerrilla unit said excitedly: "Our guerrilla unit will soon be inserted into the enemy's heartland again. We will tell the people in the southern enemy-occupied areas about the Chinese People's Volunteers helping us to strike at the American bandits." The guerrillas sang their team song heroically: "We are fighting in the far rear of the enemy, we can't eat well, we can't dress well, and there is a possibility of sacrifice every day. But we are not discouraged! We have the leadership of Kim Il-sung, the battle must be victorious; we must fight to the end for the revolution! When we are sacrificed, ... please cover us with the red flag of the Party."
    The Korean comrades' firm fighting spirit inspired the Volunteer soldiers. They enthusiastically signed up to join the assault team attacking the enemy's defense line, determined to answer the Korean people's love with even greater victories.

　　胜利会师
    记我志愿军与朝鲜游击队的会见
　　马骥
    去年十二月某夜三点钟，在朝鲜中部江原道冒着大风雪向三十八度线挺进的志愿军某营，进入一个村庄宿营。忽然从村中跑出来五个朝鲜青年，他们一发现来的是中国人民志愿部队，就一拥而上，欢呼着把几个战士抬了起来。他们指着自己说：“我们是金日成游击队”。这时全村的男女老少几乎都涌出来了。中朝人民战士们互相握手、拥抱，在黑夜里高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“金日成万岁！”游击队员们、老乡们忙着替战士们拍去身上的雪花，不由分说地把他们拥进屋子里去。
    游击队的政治指导员和我国人民志愿军的副营长开始笔谈。指导员写道：“你们吃饭，我们做。”副营长答复他说：“你们粮食缺，我们自己做。”指导员看了，在纸上连写了三个“不行”。而就在他们笔谈的时候，游击队员们早就开始替志愿军做饭了，志愿军战士们怎么也拦不住他们。
    饭后，朝鲜男女游击队员们又拿出自己的棉衣、被子来，让战士们盖着睡觉。双方送来推去，谦让了好久。战士们倒头睡下后，棉衣、棉被又都堆在身上了。战士们深深感受到了朝鲜同志们的无限温暖。
    第二天下午，这个偏僻的小村庄里，到处是歌声和笑声。中朝人民战士三个五个地围坐在一起，轮流着唱中国歌和朝鲜歌。
    晚上，中朝人民战士又举行了联欢晚会，互相介绍了两国人民的革命斗争事迹。游击队的司令员激动地说：“我们游击队马上又要向敌人心脏地区插进去，我们要把中国人民志愿军帮助我们打击美国强盗的事迹，告诉南部敌占区的人民。”游击队员们雄壮地唱起了他们的队歌：“我们在敌人的远后方作战，吃不上，穿不上，每天都有牺牲的可能。但是，我们毫不沮丧！我们有金日成的领导，战斗一定要胜利；我们要为革命而斗争到底！在我们牺牲的时候，……请把党的红旗覆盖在我们身上。”
    朝鲜同志们的坚强斗志，激励着志愿军战士们。他们热烈的报名参加攻击敌人防线的突击队，决心以更大的胜利来回答朝鲜人民的热爱。
