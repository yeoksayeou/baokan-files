　　Credit of the Xibaicheng Village Cooperative
　　Li Yi
　　Xibaicheng Village in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, has 134 households with 754 people, 184 male laborers, and 136 female laborers. It has 2417 mu of cultivated land, with paddy fields accounting for 70 percent. There are 44 waterwheels, 54 large brick wells, and 116 head of draught animals, and 42 households have flour mills. Most farmers live by farming, with yam and wheat as the main crops. The masses live a relatively prosperous life, but are very simple. Some farmers, not long after their liberation, lacked savings and could not withstand the attack of disasters. After the land reform, rural borrowing relations stagnated, and the masses felt unable to solve urgent needs such as purchasing fertilizers, farm tools, livestock, as well as weddings, funerals and illnesses. Therefore, the masses reflected that "there is no way to borrow," and demanded to develop credit.

　　The village cooperative was established in 1949, focusing on supply and marketing business at the time, with only 279 members. Because there were few members and small funds, it could not operate independently, so it invested its shares in the county cooperative, becoming a distribution unit. In July last year, the cooperative carried out re-election on a democratic basis, withdrew its shares from the county cooperative, operated independently, and established a credit department in February under the leadership of the county supply and marketing cooperative, according to the urgent needs of farmers, to be responsible for organizing and leading rural credit and helping farmers solve specific difficulties in production and life.

　　At the beginning of promoting credit business, the masses had some ideological concerns and expressed doubts about the government's policy of guaranteeing free lending. Although the credit department was established, no one was willing to deposit anything. After analysis: there were mainly the following concerns: fear of being labeled as rich and being struggled against, fear of depositing good things and getting bad things back, fear of losing money, fear of depositing easily but taking out with difficulty.

　　Based on this situation, the county cooperative first held repeated discussions through the branch and the village government to explain the benefits of credit, explaining that depositors earn interest and borrowers benefit; and studied the questions raised by everyone. According to everyone's opinions, the business charter for credit business was determined. Because the contents of the charter were clearly stipulated, and after publicity and explanation, the worries of the peasant masses gradually disappeared. Started with free lending among the masses, and gradually turned to the credit business of the cooperative.

　　Extensive publicity was carried out in accordance with the credit business charter, and the party members and cadres played a leading role, mobilizing their close farmers to lend grain, and the credit business of the village cooperative gradually developed. For example, Zhang Yucheng, the director of the village cooperative, first lent 12 shi of wheat from his aunt to eight households including Liu Yintang, and also mobilized his brother to lend out 2 shi and 9 dou of corn. Lending relations began to occur between households. At this time, the village cadres widely publicized "deposit real things, guarantee capital and value, with an interest rate of 2% per month." After the wheat harvest, because it was the season of more deposits and fewer loans, a four-month fixed deposit with a monthly interest rate of 2.5% was also stipulated. After the wheat harvest, middle peasant Liu Zhankui deposited grain worth 407 jin of fertilizer, withdrew it when planting wheat, and also received interest of 50 jin of bean cake. From then on, the role and credit of credit were recognized by the masses, and the number of people depositing grain also increased.

　　The village cooperative has 104 depositors, with grain deposits worth 30,283,075 yuan. After the wheat harvest alone, 37 households deposited more than 10,000 jin of wheat. There are 448 borrowing households, with a total loan of grain worth 93,267,971 yuan. In the past six months, due to the cooperative's lending of grain, the village has increased fertilizer by more than 60,000 jin. Forty-five households have solved the difficulty of grain shortage in the spring famine through free lending, and other households have greatly benefited in production and life. Due to the active credit business in the village, it has also driven credit work in nine villages including Sun, Li, Ma Sanluohou, and Haozhuang. Last year, the village had a bumper harvest, with more deposits and fewer loans. It is planned to contact the county cooperative to lend to the flood-stricken areas and recover the wheat by the wheat harvest.

　　The development of credit in Xibaicheng Village in the past six months proves that developing credit work and enlivening rural finance is the urgent demand of the current farmers. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to solving the following problems. The first is that farmers have great concerns about free lending. To dispel concerns, we must start from the following three aspects: 1. Persuade party members to lead the masses and comprehensively promote it through the party branch. 2. The masses have a bad impression of the old cooperatives and always adopt a tentative attitude towards the establishment of new cooperatives. Therefore, cooperatives must have clear accounts, strictly abide by credit; cadres must have a correct work style, and educate the masses to expand credit business with the actual interests of the members. 3. When carrying out credit work, be sure to pay attention to cultivating cadres supported by the members of the community. The success of the Baicheng Village Cooperative in concurrently running credit business is inseparable from the impartial enthusiasm of the deputy directors Zhang Chunhua and Zhang Yucheng and their responsible spirit to the masses.

　　Second, according to the current rural situation, it is better for supply and marketing cooperatives to concurrently operate credit business. Because farmers mostly deposit cotton and grain, and their expenses are mostly fertilizers, tools or necessities, it is difficult to meet the needs of both depositors and borrowers if they are not converted through supply and marketing business. Credit business and supply and marketing business must be combined.

　　Third, at present, rural credit is prone to imbalance between depositors and borrowers due to different economic conditions in different regions and seasonal differences. This imbalance cannot be solved by a single village. The county cooperative must strengthen the leadership of credit business and transfer materials in a timely manner to reduce the expenditure of empty interest. At the same time, seek help from the bank to meet the requirements of the members.

　　Fourth, when carrying out rural credit, the interest rate should be properly stipulated. The interest rate should generally be lower than the average interest rate of private lending and higher than the interest rate of special loans from banks. At the beginning, let the masses boldly discuss and set the interest rate themselves. The village community flexibly controlling the credit interest rate is an important link in the development of credit business.

### 西白城村社的信贷

　　西白城村社的信贷
　　李毅
    河北清苑县西白城村有一三四户、七五四人，男劳动力一八四人，女劳动力一三六人，耕地二四一七亩，水田占百分之七十。有水车四十四辆，大砖井五十四眼，耕畜一一六头，粉房四十二户。大部农民靠种地生活，农产以山药、小麦为主，群众生活较富裕，但很朴素。有些农民翻身不久，缺乏积蓄，经不起灾难的袭击。土地改革后农村借贷关系陷于停顿，群众对购买肥料、农具、牲畜以及婚丧嫁娶疾病等急需，感到无法解决。因此，群众反映“拆借无门”，要求开展信贷。
    该村合作社于一九四九年建立，当时以供销业务为主，社员仅二七九名。因社员少，资金小，自己不能独立经营，所以将股金入到县社，成了分配单位。该社于去年七月在民主的基础上，实行了改选，从县社抽回股金，单独经营，并根据农民迫切要求，于二月在县供销社领导下，成立了信用部，负责组织领导农村信贷，帮助农民解决生产和生活上的具体困难。
    在推行信贷业务之初，群众有若干思想顾虑，对政府保障自由借贷的政策表示怀疑。信用部虽成立起来，但谁也不愿存东西。经分析：主要有以下几种顾虑：怕落富名被斗争、怕存好的还坏的、怕赔本、怕存进易取出难。
    根据这一情况，县社首先通过支部、村政权反复座谈，说明信贷的好处，讲明存者生息，贷者有利；并对大家提出的问题作了研究。根据大家意见，确定信贷业务经营章程。由于章程内容规定分明，再经过宣传解释，农民群众的顾虑便渐渐消除。先由群众自由借贷开始，渐渐转向为合作社的信贷业务。
    根据信贷业务章程进行广泛宣传，党员、干部又起了带头作用，动员自己相好的农户贷粮，该村社信贷业务就逐渐开展起来。如村社主任张玉臣首先将他婶母的十二石麦子贷给刘银棠等八户，还动员自己的哥哥，把放着的二石九斗玉米放出去。户与户开始发生了借贷关系。这时村干部又广泛宣传“存款存实，保本保值，一月二分利”。麦收后因系存多贷少的季节，又规定了四个月定期存款，月息二分五。中农刘占奎麦收后存入粮食折肥四百零七斤，到种麦时支了出来，又得了五十斤豆饼的利息。从此，信贷的作用和信用，被群众所认识，存粮的人也就增加了。
    该村社有存户一○四户，存粮折款三○二八三○七五元，只麦收后，就有三十七户存麦一万多斤。借粮户四四八户，共贷粮款折九三二六七九七一元。半年来，由于合作社贷粮，全村增肥六万余斤。四十五户通过自由借贷，解决了春荒缺粮困难，其余各户，在生产和生活上都得到很大好处。由于该村信贷业务的活跃，带动了孙、李、马三罗候、郝庄等九个村也开展了信贷工作。去年该村丰收，存多贷少，计划与县社接洽，出贷到水灾区，至麦收时收回麦子。
    半年来，西白城村开展信贷中证明：开展信贷工作，活跃农村金融，是当前农民的迫切要求。但是，还须注意以下几个问题的解决。第一是农民对自由借贷有很大的顾虑。要解除顾虑，就要从以下三个方面着手：１、通过党的支部说服党员带动群众，全面推广。２、群众对旧合作社的印象坏，对成立新合作社也总是抱着试探态度。因此合作社必须帐目清楚，严守信用；干部作风正派，用社员实际利益，教育群众扩大信用业务。３、开展信贷工作时，一定要注意培养社员群众拥护的干部。白城村社兼办信贷成功，是和正副主任张春华、张玉臣的公正热心以及对群众负责的精神分不开的。
    第二，根据现时农村情况，供销社兼营信用业务较好。因为农民存的多是棉、粮，支出又多是肥料、工具或必需品，如不通过供销业务转换，难以满足存贷双方需要。信贷业务与供销业务必须结合起来。
    第三，现时农村信贷因各地区不同的经济情况，与季节性的差异，因此很容易产生存贷双方不平衡的现象。这一不平衡的现象，单靠一村举办是不能解决问题的，县社必须加强信贷业务领导，及时调转物资，以减少空头利息的开支。同时求得银行的帮助，以满足社员的要求。
    第四，开展农村信贷，要把利率规定得当。利率一般应低于私人借贷的平均利率，高于银行的专款出贷利率。在开始时，要大胆让群众自己议订利率。村社机动掌握信贷利率，是信贷业务开展的重要环节。
