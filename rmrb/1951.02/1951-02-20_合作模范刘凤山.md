    Cooperation Model Liu Fengshan
    Comrade Liu Fengshan is the director of the New Rural Cooperative in Beixing District, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. Because he wholeheartedly serves the members and manages the cooperative well, he was honorably elected as a representative of Heilongjiang Province to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. After he returned from the meeting in Beijing, the village cooperative had new improvements.
    Liu Fengshan's cooperative can hold member congresses and board of directors/supervisors meetings on schedule. Last year, two member congresses were held to report the accounts to the members, listen to the members' opinions on the cooperative, and formulate the cooperative's general work guidelines and plans. The board of directors/supervisors of the cooperative holds a meeting once a month during the busy farming season and twice a month during the slack farming season, focusing on inspecting work and solving specific problems, and formulating short-term supply and marketing plans.
    The cooperative plays a significant role in supporting members' agricultural production. For example, many members lacked seeds during the spring plowing season, and the cooperative solved the problem of seed shortages for the masses. In the past two years, the village cooperative has supplied the masses with 23,769 jin of seeds. In winter, Liu Fengshan planned to prepare a large amount of fertilizer, so that most of the more than 200 hectares of land in the village received cheap fertilizer from the cooperative. Most of the farm tools in the village are supplied by the cooperative. Last spring, the cooperative collected more than 2,000 jin of scrap iron from the whole village and exchanged it for plowshares to supply to the members, and supplied all the parts for new farm tools; during summer hoeing, it supplied hoe blades, hoe hooks, hoe handles, weeding hoes, straw hats, etc.; in autumn, it supplied fork handles, brooms, files, sickles, etc. Last year, the county suffered from drought and crop yields were reduced. Liu Fengshan immediately mobilized the members to engage in sideline production. Last autumn, more than 70 women in the village were organized to earn more than seven shi of grain in seven days. In addition, 56 people were mobilized to weave mats, 34 people to hunt, and 55 people to collect firewood. Throughout the winter, the cooperative sold 267.45 million yuan (Northeast currency) worth of sideline products for its members, which could buy more than 377 shi of grain. He also solved the problem of selling some products by having members sign exchange contracts with each other.
    Because Liu Fengshan led the village cooperative to achieve such good results, it was awarded the honorary title of "Model Banner of Rural Supply and Marketing Work."

    合作模范刘凤山
    刘凤山同志是黑龙江省克山县北兴区新农村合作社的主任。由于他全心全意为社员服务，办好了合作社，光荣地当选为黑龙江省出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。他从北京开会回去后，该村合作社又有了新的改进。
    刘凤山合作社能按期召开社员大会和理监事会。去年开了两次社员大会，向社员报告了帐目，并听取了社员对合作社的意见，订出了合作社总的工作方针和计划。该社理监事会在农忙时每月召开一次，农闲时每月要开两次，着重在检查工作和解决某些具体问题，并订出短期供销计划。
    该社在扶助社员农业生产上起的作用是很大的。如春耕时许多社员缺籽种，合作社即解决群众缺乏种子的问题，两年来该村合作社供给群众籽种二万三千七百六十九斤。冬季刘凤山有计划地准备了大批肥料，使全村二百多垧地大半得到了合作社的廉价肥料。全村大部分农具是由合作社供给的。去年春天合作社收了全村二千多斤碎铁，换回犁铧供给社员，并供应了新农具的一切零件；到夏锄时又供给锄板、锄钩、锄杠、扒锄、草帽等；秋季则供给叉把、扫帚、铣、镰刀等。去年该县遭了旱灾，庄稼减收，刘凤山立即发动社员搞副业生产。去年秋季组织了全村七十多名妇女，在七天工夫里赚了七石多粮食。另外发动了五十六人编席，三十四人打猎，五十五人打柴。在整个冬季里，该社共给社员推销了二亿六千七百四十五万元（东北币）的副业产品，能买三七七石多粮食。他在社员互相间订立交换合同，这也解决了一些产品的推销问题。
    由于刘凤山领导该村合作社有这样好的成绩，因之得到“农村供销工作的模范旗帜”的光荣称号。  中共克山县委会宣传部  吴殿坤
