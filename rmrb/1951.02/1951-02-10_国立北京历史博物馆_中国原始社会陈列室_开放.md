    "Chinese Primitive Society Exhibition Hall" Opens
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The National Beijing History Museum's "Chinese Primitive Society Exhibition Hall" officially opened on the 2nd of this month in the East Wing of the Meridian Gate. This exhibition hall is the first part of the museum's planned exhibition on the history of Chinese social development; the remaining parts are currently in preparation.
    The exhibition hall is arranged according to the history of social development, using archaeological artifacts and employing dioramas, models, and paintings for representation. It allows the audience to understand how our ancestors in primitive society overcame nature through productive struggle, using labor to create the world.
    The exhibition is divided into two major stages: the Paleolithic Age and the Neolithic Age.
    The Paleolithic Age is divided into three stages based on currently discovered materials: the "Peking Man" - "Chinese Ape-Man" of 500,000 years ago, the "Ordos Man" of 200,000 years ago, and the "Upper Cave Man" of 100,000 years ago.
    The Neolithic Age is arranged according to modes of production and their superstructure, including stone tools which were the main production tools, pottery representing the culture of the time, scenes of hunting and fishing, animal husbandry, farming, and textiles, as well as family organization, chieftain elections, artistic beliefs, and so on.
    From these displays, one can see the division of labor between farming and animal husbandry. At the same time, due to the development of productive forces and the increasing surplus production, not only did ideological forms such as art and culture gradually become enriched, but also private property gradually emerged, ultimately leading to the budding of classes.

　　国立北京历史博物馆
    “中国原始社会陈列室”开放
    【本报讯】国立北京历史博物馆“中国原始社会陈列室”，已于本月二日在午门该馆东朝房正式开放。该陈列室是该馆所计划的中国社会发展史陈列的第一部分，其余各部分正在筹备中。
    该陈列室依照社会发展史，根据考古学上的实物，用布景箱、模型、绘画来表现。使观众能认识到我们的祖先在原始社会的生产斗争，如何克服自然，用劳动来创造世界。
    该室陈列分旧石器时代与新石器时代两大阶段。
    旧石器时代依据今日所发现的材料，分五十万年前的“中国猿人”——“北京人”，二十万年前的“河套人”和十万年前的“山顶洞人”三个阶段。
    新石器时代，按生产方式及其上层建筑陈列：计有主要生产工具的石器、代表当时文化的陶器、渔猎、牧畜、农耕、纺织等，以及家属组织、酋长选举、艺术迷信等场面。
    从这些陈列中，可以看出农耕与牧畜的分工。同时，由于生产力的发展，剩余生产的日增，不仅艺术文化等意识形态日渐丰富起来，而且私有财产也逐渐产生，最后进到阶级的萌芽。
