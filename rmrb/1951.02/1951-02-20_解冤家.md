　　Resolving Grievances
    By our reporter accompanying the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, Shen Shi

    Before liberation, Yi compatriots in the Greater Liangshan area competed to buy guns and ammunition, fighting each other and seizing children. Only eight months after liberation, people in the Greater Liangshan area have signed unity pacts, with enemies voluntarily inviting their former foes for drinks, willing to resolve old grudges. Various branches have proposed launching a "resolving grievances" competition.

    The Kuomintang bandit gang's reactionary policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" caused mutual killings between different branches of the Yi people, even within the same clan. The Wazha family, distributed in the dense forest area, with the Wazha Yilu branch and the Wazha Nielie branch, were mortal enemies. The most famous Luohong family in the Yi area, the Luohong Chaer branch, was constantly fighting internally. A large branch often had more than a dozen enemy branches. The Baqi family around Zhaojue City had enemies including the Ma family in Zhuhai, over 20 li from Zhaojue, the Ma family in Kaibaizi, over 40 li from Zhaojue, the Ma family in Luoluogou (about 100 li from Zhaojue) and Xuanshengba (60 li from Xichang), as well as the Wazha family in the dense forest area, the Ahou, Sugua, and Alu families in Niuniuba, and the Guji and Luohong families.

    How did the Kuomintang reactionaries directly attack the Yi people and provoke the tragedy of internal strife among the Yi people? Let's look at the following facts.

    In 1939, Kuomintang bandit troops stationed in the dense forest area upstream of the Zhaojue River in the Greater Liangshan area, in order to control the Yi people and massively purchase opium in the Greater Liangshan area, deliberately tricked more than 20 Black and White Yi people from the Zhuhai Ma family to Xichang for "training." Because the Zhuhai Ma family and the Baqi family near Zhaojue City were enemies, when the Black and White Yi people of the Ma family passed through Zhaojue City on their way to Xichang for "training," the Kuomintang bandit gang deliberately asked the headman of the Baqi family, Wahe Moshi, and others to greet them. Wahe Moshi was furious. When the Black and White Yi people of the Ma family entered Zhaojue, they blocked the city gate, killing two Black Yi people and three White Yi people of the Ma family. The Kuomintang bandits then took the opportunity to transfer a machine gun platoon and an infantry company from Xichang, and incited the Wazha family, the Ahou family, the Ashuo family, the Ma family in Erwubaizi and Sikaibaizi, and the Li'ai family in Lanba, to jointly besiege the Baqi Miche branch, Baqi Puche branch, and Baqi Azuo branch in Xiaohaizi. They burned down all the houses of the Miche branch, ordered the Baqi family to hand over the headmen of three branches, and took four Black Yi people from the Baqi family to Xichang as hostages. As a result, the Baqi family paid the Ma family 4,800 taels of silver for the lives of five Black and White Yi people.

    In September 1940, the Kuomintang bandit army forcibly collected grain in the Zhaojue area. The Baqi and Ashuo families could not resist the grain levy. After the conflict, the Kuomintang bandit army killed six Black and White Yi people from the Baqi family. They also instigated the Ma family, Ahou family, Sugua family, Wazha family, and Nuomi family to surround the Zhaojue dam, burn down all the houses of eight of the ten branches of the Baqi family, and confiscate all the land. The Baqi Miche branch originally had more than 200 cattle and horses, more than 200 sheep, and an average of about 30 shi of grain per household. After two incidents, the houses were burned twice, the cattle, sheep, and grain were all looted, and eleven Black and White Yi people were killed. The Miche branch originally had 14 Black Yi households and more than 100 White Yi households; after this suppression, only 12 Black Yi households and 80 White Yi households remained.

    Because there was a custom of fighting grievances among the Yi people, enemies could not pass through the territory of their opponents. For example, the Baqi family, who lived around Zhaojue City, wanted to go to Xichang and had to pass through Sanwanhe, Sikaibaizi, Lanba, Luoluogou, and Xuanshengba. However, the Ma family and Ashuo family in Sanwanhe, the Ma family in Sikaibaizi, the Ma family and Li'ai family in Lanba, and the Ma family in Luoluogou and Xuanshengba were all enemies of the Baqi family. Therefore, people from the Baqi family could only be confined to the small area around Zhaojue City year-round, and few had ever been to Xichang. The Alu family, distributed near the Meigu River, more than 140 li from Zhaojue, had never been to Zhaojue. When Alu Naqie of the Alu family first came to Zhaojue to contact the Liangshan Working Group of the People's Government after Zhaojue was liberated, he hired five protectors to pass through the territory of his enemies, the Wupo, Zhuhai Ma, and Baqi families. The Ahou family in Niuniuba had also never been to Zhaojue. His family was related to the Nuomi family in the Sanwanhe area. In the early days of liberation, Ahou Guge of the Ahou family wanted to visit the Nuomi family, and he hired three protectors to pass through the areas under the jurisdiction of his enemies, the Baqi and Wazha families. The Baqi family and the Zhuhai Ma family were only separated by a mountain ridge, which was the old place where the two families fought. For many years, the Ma family did not dare to cross this mountain ridge to go to Zhaojue.

    Fighting grievances caused heavy casualties and countless losses of cattle, sheep, houses, and grain. At the same time, a large amount of land was also left barren. The Enchi Jiatuo area in Sanwanhe was a large area of fertile land, originally belonging to the An Tusi; after the An Tusi died without an heir, the Ashuo family planted it. Deng Xouting, a big local tyrant in Mianning, encouraged the Nuomi family to unite with the Wazha family to occupy this land. The Kuomintang bandit army supported the Ashuo family, wanting to take back this land, but was strongly resisted by the Wazha and Nuomi families and never succeeded. As a result, neither side dared to cultivate it.

    The Liangshan area is full of bare mountains, with very few forests. This is certainly related to the fact that the Yi people still follow the primitive method of "slash-and-burn" cultivation, but the large-scale felling of trees to avoid attacks from enemies is also an important reason. The Yi people, fearing attacks from enemies hiding in the forests while herding sheep or cultivating, cut down all the trees around the village. In this way, even if enemies came to attack, they could be discovered from a long distance away.

    The houses of the Yi people have no windows, and grain, livestock, and people all live in the same room. Can they open a few windows? But with windows, enemies would shoot at sleeping people through the windows at night. Can they separate pigs, cattle, and people? But in the middle of the night, enemies would sneak in, dig a big hole under the wall, and lead away the pigs and cattle, sometimes without being noticed.

    The custom of fighting grievances made the Yi people live in constant fear. They did not dare to boldly herd sheep, did not dare to sleep peacefully, and often had to be armed and vigilant. The Kuomintang bandit gang took advantage of this fighting of grievances to make a large profit by trading opium for guns and ammunition. The more guns and ammunition that flowed in, the more popular the custom of fighting grievances became. After the liberation of Greater Liangshan, the Liangshan Working Group, led by Zhou Quanjie, arrived in Zhaojue, Zhuhai, Sanwanhe, and other places to carry out work. They gathered residents for discussions, publicized the ethnic policies of the People's Government, and explained the harm of fighting grievances. They analyzed that the main reason for fighting grievances was the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the victims were the Yi compatriots, while those who made a fortune were the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Yi compatriots were deeply moved by the hard-working style and kind and humble attitude of the working comrades. When the working comrades mediated disputes between enemies, they did not accept any remuneration, and painstakingly persuaded both sides not to remember old hatreds and not to settle old scores. The Yi compatriots compared this with the fact that in the past, Kuomintang reactionary bureaucrats "mediated" disputes between enemies, and whoever sent more silver had the right to do so; while the comrades of the working group distinguished right from wrong, fairly mediated and handled the disputes, and the disputes could be properly resolved without sending a single bit of silver. In this way, they understood that the custom of fighting grievances in the past was entirely created by the Kuomintang reactionaries; and they understood that the People's Government was truly working for them and truly hoped that they would unite. After the Yi compatriots understood these principles, the incidents of fighting grievances gradually decreased, and the incidents of kidnapping and seizing children also rarely occurred. They began to herd sheep and harvest crops in peace, and they could sleep boldly. In the past, they competed to buy guns, and an ordinary rifle cost as much as 500 taels of silver; now, no guns or ammunition flowed into the Liangshan area from outside, and the price of a gun was reduced to 100 taels of silver, and still no one wanted it.

    Starting on January 13, the Liangshan Working Group convened a three-day forum in Zhaojue for representatives of various Yi branches in the Greater Liangshan area. The Central Visiting Group, led by Director Liu Geping, also rushed to participate. The headmen and Tumu of various Black Yi branches who attended the meeting traveled for seven or eight days from Tiandiba, Dengchang, and other places on the Yunnan border near the Jinsha River. The representatives who attended the forum were warmly received and welcomed, and were also respected by people from all walks of life in Zhaojue. They were photographed and given flowers. Director Liu Geping conveyed the concern of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and Chairman Liu Bocheng of the Southwest Military and Political Committee for the Yi people, and called on the Yi people to unite internally. The representatives were deeply moved.

    At the forum, a mediation committee was established, and a unity pact for all Yi compatriots in the Greater Liangshan area was drawn up. The pact stipulates: (1) Cases before liberation will generally not be settled, and past grievances will be written off to rebuild a happy life of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation. (2) Fighting grievances and mutually encroaching on land, seizing people, stealing, seizing children, and mutually cursing and other divisive behaviors are prohibited. (3) If disputes occur, relatives and family members should be informed to mediate; if they still cannot be resolved, the mediation committee should mediate; if they cannot be resolved, they should be sent to the People's Government for handling according to law. Acts such as mutual retaliation, vendettas, and assassinations are prohibited. (4) If incidents such as murder, encroachment, seizure, and theft occur, in addition to mediation by relatives, family members, and the mediation committee, they should be handled by the People's Government according to law.

    Because the representatives of the various branches recognized the ethnic policies of the People's Government and personally experienced Chairman Mao's concern for the Yi people, many branches voluntarily invited their enemies to drink, and reconciled with each other. Baqi Wulie, Baqi Aguo, Baqi Jiha, and others of the Baqi family invited Sugua Riha of the Sugua family, their enemy, to drink, and the old grudges between the two families were written off from then on. Wazha Natie of the Wazha family was willing to reconcile with the Ma family and resolve the disputes that had lasted for more than 20 years. The Baqi family specially invited Ma Wuda of the Zhuhai Ma family to their home for a drink, and both families were willing to reconcile.

    Er'ou Yida, a Black Yi Tumu from Lanba, said: "In the past, we competed in buying bullets, buying guns, and fighting grievances; from now on, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will use unity competitions and production competitions to repay Chairman Mao's kindness."

　　解冤家
    本报随中央西南各民族访问团记者　沈石
    解放前的大凉山区，彝族同胞都争着购买枪枝、弹药，相互打冤家、抢娃子。解放后仅八个月的大凉山区，大家却订立了团结公约，冤家自动请冤家喝酒，愿意消释旧仇。各支头间则提出：要展开“解冤家”竞赛。
    国民党匪帮“以夷制夷”的反动政策，造成彝族这一支头和那一支头间，甚至同宗族内部的相互仇杀。分布在林密地一带的瓦渣家，瓦渣伊卢支和瓦渣涅烈支便是死对头。彝区最著名的罗洪家，罗洪查耳党支内部，就是你打我，我打你。一个大的支头，它的冤家往往多到十几个支头。昭觉城周围的八齐家，它的冤家有离昭觉二十余里竹核地方的马家，离昭觉四十余里开坝子的马家，倮倮沟（距昭觉百里左右）、玄生坝（距西昌六十里）的马家，还有林密地的瓦渣家，牛牛坝的阿侯家、苏呷家、阿卢家，以及古基家、罗洪家等。
    国民党反动派是怎样直接攻打彝民和怎样挑起彝族内部自相残杀的悲剧呢？请看一看以下的事实吧。
    一九三九年，驻在大凉山区昭觉河上游林密地的国民党匪军，为了羁縻彝民，好在大凉山地区大量收购鸦片，故意哄骗竹核马家的二十多个黑彝和白彝到西昌“受训”。因为竹核马家和昭觉城附近的八齐家是冤家，当马家到西昌“受训”的黑、白彝经过昭觉城时，国民党匪帮，便故意叫八齐家的头人瓦核莫施等来迎接。瓦核莫施气极了，等到马家的黑、白彝进了昭觉，便堵住城门，打死马家黑彝二人，白彝三人。国民党匪徒便趁机从西昌调来一个机枪排，一个步兵连，并煽动瓦渣家、阿侯家、阿硕家、二五坝子和四开坝子的马家、滥坝的李埃家，一同围攻小海子的八齐米磋支、八齐蒲车支、八齐阿左支。烧毁米磋支全部房屋，勒令八齐家交出三支头人，并将八齐家四个黑彝抓到西昌，作为人质。结果八齐家赔了马家五名黑、白彝的命钱四千八百两银子。
    一九四○年九月，国民党匪军在昭觉一带强迫征粮。八齐家和阿硕家都抗不上粮。冲突发生后，国民党匪军打死八齐家黑、白彝六人。并挑拨马家、阿侯家、苏呷家、瓦渣家、糯米家，围住昭觉坝子，烧毁八齐家十个支头中八个支头的全部房屋，并没收全部土地。八齐家米磋支原有牛、马二百余头，羊二百余只，粮食每户平均有三十石左右。经过先后两次事件，房屋两次被烧，牛、羊、粮食全部被劫，死黑、白彝十一人。米磋支原有黑彝十四户，白彝百余户；经过这次镇压，黑彝只剩下十二户，白彝减到八十户。
    由于彝族内部存在着打冤家的风气，冤家和冤家，谁也不能通过对方所属的地区。如住在昭觉城周围的八齐家，想要从昭觉去西昌，得经过三湾河、四开坝子、滥坝、倮倮沟、玄生坝等地。但是，三湾河的马家、阿硕家，四开坝子的马家，滥坝的马家，李埃家，倮倮沟，玄生坝的马家，都是八齐家的冤家，因此，八齐家的人，只有终年困守在昭觉城周围的狭小地带内，很少有人到过西昌。分布在离昭觉一百四十余里美姑河附近的阿卢家，它家的人，从来没有到过昭觉。昭觉刚解放时，阿卢家的阿卢那且第一次来昭觉，向人民政府凉山工作团接头时，找了五个保头，才得通过他家的冤家——乌坡家、竹核马家和八齐家所属的地界。牛牛坝的阿侯家，也从来没有人到过昭觉。他家和三湾河一带的糯米家是亲戚，解放初期，阿侯家的阿侯姑格要去探望糯米家，找了三个保头，才能通过冤家八齐家和瓦渣家的管辖地带。八齐家和竹核马家，只隔一道山梁，这道山梁，就是两家打冤家的老地方，多年来，马家的人不敢越过这道山梁，前往昭觉。
    打冤家一方面造成惨重的人命死伤和牛羊、房屋、粮食等不可胜计的损失，同时土地也因而大量地荒芜了。三湾河恩赤加托地方是一大片肥沃的土地，原先属于安土司；安土司绝嗣以后，由阿硕家种上。冕宁大恶霸邓匪秀廷怂恿糯米家联合瓦渣家，占据了这块土地。国民党匪军便支持阿硕家，想要夺回这块土地，遭到瓦渣家和糯米家的强烈抵抗，始终没有拿下。结果弄得双方谁也不敢耕种。
    凉山地区到处是光秃秃的荒山，森林极少。这固然与彝族人民至今还沿袭着原始的“刀耕火种”的耕种方法有关系，但是，为了避免冤家的袭击而大量砍伐树木也是重要原因之一。彝族人民惟恐在牧羊或耕种时，遭到隐藏在林子里的冤家的暗中袭击，便砍光村子四周的树木。这样一来，即使有冤家来攻打，老远老远地就可以被发现了。
    彝民的房屋，没有窗户，粮食、牲口和人，都在一间屋子里。他们是不是可以开它几个窗口呢？但是，有了窗口，冤家会在黑夜里，从窗口向熟睡的人们射击。他们是不是可以将猪、牛与人隔开呢？但是，半夜里冤家会偷偷地摸来，在墙根下挖上一个大洞，牵走了猪牛，有时是很难发觉的。
    打冤家的风气，使彝族人民惶惶不可终日。他们不敢放胆地牧羊，不敢安心地睡觉，经常要武装戒备着。而国民党匪帮，便利用这种打冤家，大做其用枪枝、弹药套取鸦片的生意。枪弹流进来的越多，打冤家的风气也就更加流行了。  大凉山解放后，由周全杰领导的凉山工作团到达昭觉、竹核、三湾河等地展开工作。他们召集居民座谈，宣传人民政府的民族政策，说明打冤家的害处。分析打冤家的原因主要是国民党反动派挑起的，而结果受害的却是彝胞，发财的只是国民党反动派。彝族同胞看到工作同志的艰苦作风及和蔼、谦虚的态度，深受感动。工作同志调解冤家纠纷时，不受任何报酬，苦口婆心地劝说双方不要记旧仇，不再算老账。彝胞们对照了过去国民党反动官僚“调停”冤家纠纷的事实，那就是那方的银子越送得多，那方就有道理；而工作团的同志却分清是非，公允地调解处理，而且不要送一丝一毫银子，纠纷就可以得到适当解决。这样，使他们明白了过去打冤家的风气完全是国民党反动派所制造的；更使他们明了了人民政府真正是替他们办事的，真正是希望他们团结的。在彝胞们明了了这些道理后，打冤家的事件就逐渐地减少了，掳人、抢娃子的事件也很少发生了。他们开始安心地牧羊、收获，而且可以放胆地睡觉了。过去他们争着购买枪枝，一枝普通的步枪，价钱高到白银五百两；现在，根本没有枪弹从外地流到凉山区来，枪价却减到一百两银子还没有人要。
    一月十三日起，凉山工作团在昭觉召集大凉山区彝族各支头代表，开了三天的座谈会，刘格平团长领导的中央访问团也赶去参加。出席会议的黑彝各支头的头人和土目，有的跋涉七、八天路程，从云南边境靠近金沙江的天地坝，灯厂等地赶来。出席座谈会的代表，受到了热情地招待和欢迎，也受到昭觉各界人民的尊敬，给他们照像，给他们戴花。刘格平团长传达了中央人民政府毛主席、西南军政委员会刘伯承主席对彝族人民的关怀之意，并号召彝族内部团结，代表们极受感动。
    在座谈会上成立了调解委员会，订出了全凉山区彝胞的团结公约。公约规定：（一）解放前的案件，一般不算旧账，把过去的冤仇一笔勾销，重新建设团结、互助、友爱、合作的幸福生活。（二）禁止打冤家及相互侵占土地、抢人、偷盗、抢娃子，以及相互诅咒等不团结行为。（三）如有纠纷发生，告诉亲戚、家门调解；如仍不能解决，再经调解委员会调解；如解决不了，送人民政府依法处理。禁止相互报复、仇杀、暗杀等不法行为。（四）如有杀人、侵占、抢人、偷盗等事件发生，除先由亲戚、家门、调解委员会调解外，并经过人民政府依法处理。
    由于各支头代表认识了人民政府的民族政策，亲身体会到毛主席对彝族人民的关怀，许多支头都自动地请冤家喝酒，相互和解。八齐家的八齐五烈、八齐阿果、八齐吉哈等请他们的冤家苏呷家苏呷日哈喝酒，两家旧仇从此勾销。瓦渣家的瓦渣那铁愿意和马家和解相持二十余年的纠纷。八齐家特地请竹核马家的马五达到他们家去喝酒，两家都愿意和好起来。
    滥坝的黑彝土目尔欧以达说：“过去我们是买子弹、买枪枝、打冤家竞赛；今后，在毛主席领导下，我们要用团结竞赛，生产竞赛，来报答毛主席的恩惠。”
