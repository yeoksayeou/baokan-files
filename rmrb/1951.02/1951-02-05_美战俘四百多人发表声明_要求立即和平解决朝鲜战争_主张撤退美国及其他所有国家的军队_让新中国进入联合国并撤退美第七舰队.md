Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, 3rd—Over four hundred American prisoners of war in a certain POW camp here jointly issued a statement to the American people at home and the American soldiers still engaged in the Korean War. They confessed their participation in this sinful war of aggression and called for an end to the war so they could return home soon.

　　The statement reads in part: We have gained some iron lessons in this war; we hope to tell the people at home and our comrades who are still fighting what we are thinking now.

　　Why were we sent across five thousand miles of ocean to participate in a war that has nothing to do with ourselves or our loved ones? This war has brought destruction to a country that is rebuilding after years of oppression. We have seen the results of indiscriminate bombing of cities and villages. We have seen civilians killed, and homeless, hungry women and children wandering on the roads. We have seen our comrades die on the battlefield, in the freezing cold, without even suitable clothing for this climate, without proper burial.

　　We are ashamed of Americans' participation in this meaningless war. It drags America down and brings resentment and contempt from the Asian people. It will take many years to erase the stain of our actions. And it will take many years to rebuild what we and other troops have destroyed in Korea in these few months. We feel acutely that we are collectively responsible for all the pain caused.

　　For big American businesses, war means profits from contracts for planes, tanks, uniforms, artillery, munitions, and other materials. But for us soldiers, war means pain, desolation, and loss of life, and for the people at home, war means broken families, increased taxes, and suffering.

　　We have now seen through the deception of this "police action." We are particularly disgusted by the order to cross the 38th parallel and the empty promises that we would return home after Thanksgiving and then after Christmas.

　　We should never have meddled here in the first place. We Americans once had a civil war of our own; we would have been angry if any other country had interfered. We resent being used to do such a thing. Regarding the fabricated news that the People's Army cruelly treats our soldiers, we have this to say: We have received the best treatment from the Chinese and Koreans since we were captured.

　　We advocate: (1) Withdraw the troops of the United States and all other countries and leave Korea to the Koreans. End this foolish war. (2) Let New China occupy its rightful place in the United Nations. Our country should recognize this New China. It is a great nation. We should withdraw the Seventh Fleet from the Chinese seas to prevent more wars. (3) We call for immediate action to prevent American lives from being sacrificed any further. Stop this meaningless war. We demand an immediate peaceful resolution. Let us go home as soon as possible.

　　The statement was signed by American POWs Philip Elson (number AF13158602), Benny L. Pete (number RA38082522), Albert C. Belhome (number RA13296992), and more than four hundred others.

　　美战俘四百多人发表声明
    要求立即和平解决朝鲜战争         
    主张撤退美国及其他所有国家的军队        
    让新中国进入联合国并撤退美第七舰队
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地三日电】这里某战俘营的四百多个美军战俘联名向美国国内人民和还在进行侵朝战争的美军士兵发表一个声明，忏悔他们自己参加了这个罪恶的侵略战争，并呼吁停止这个战争，让他们早日回家。
    声明略称：我们已在这个战争中获得了若干铁的教训；我们希望能够向国内的人民和仍旧在打仗的我们的伙伴们说一说我们现在所想的是什么。
    为什么要派我们远渡五千英里的重洋，到这里来参加一个与我们自己或我们所亲爱的人毫不相干的战争呢？这个战争给一个在受了好多年的压迫以后正在进行建设的国家带来了毁灭。我们看到对城市和村庄大肆滥炸的结果。我们看到老百姓被杀死，无家可归的饥饿的妇女儿童漂泊在路上。我们看到我们的伙伴们在战场上、在冰天雪地中死去，甚至连适合这种气候的衣服也没有，连适当的埋葬都没有。
    我们对于美国人参加这个毫无意义的战争觉得很惭愧。它把美国拖下去而带来的却是亚洲人民对我们的愤恨与蔑视。要消除我们行动的污点需要好多年的时光。而要重建我们和其他的军队在这几个月中所破坏的朝鲜也要好多年。我们痛切地感到，对于所造成的一切痛苦，我们是要集体负责的。
    对于美国的大企业说来，战争意味着从飞机、坦克、军服合同、大炮、军火和其他物资中取得利润。但是对于我们兵士们说来，战争却意味着惨痛、凄凉和牺牲生命，而对国内的人民说来，战争意味着家破人亡，捐高税涨和痛苦。
    我们现在已从这个“警察行动”的欺骗中看明白了。我们对于越过三八线的命令和首先答应我们在感恩节以后又答应在圣诞节回国的空洞诺言特别觉得厌恶。
    我们早就不应该在这里管闲事。我们美国自己曾经有过内战；任何别的国家出来干涉，我们一定会表示愤怒的。我们对于被利用来做这样一种事甚觉愤恨。对于传说人民军残酷地对待我们的兵士的虚构的消息，我们有这样的话要说：我们自从被俘以来从中国人和朝鲜人方面获得了最好的待遇。
    我们主张：（一）撤退美国和其他所有国家的军队，把朝鲜交给朝鲜人。结束这个愚笨的战争。（二）让新中国在联合国中占有它的正当地位。我们的国家应该承认这个新中国。它是一个伟大的民族。我们应该从中国的海面上撤退第七舰队以防发生更多的战事。（三）我们呼吁立即做些事情使美国人的生命不会再遭到牺牲。停止这个毫无意义的战争。我们要求立即和平解决。让我们尽可能早些回家。
    在这个声明上签名的有美军战俘菲列浦·埃隆生（号码ＡＦ一三一五八六○二），倍尼·Ｌ·皮台（号码ＲＡ三八○八二五二二），阿尔培特·Ｃ·贝尔荷梅（号码ＲＡ一三二九六九九二）等四百多人。
