Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The Council meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which began on January 31st in Berlin, has the following four main agenda items: (1) Implementing the resolutions of the World Peace Congress; (2) Strengthening the united action of the international women's movement; (3) Expanding the movement to protect children; (4) Admitting new members.

　　When Madam Krupskaya, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda, she pointed out that the main task of the Women's International Democratic Federation at present is to absorb millions of women to participate in the movement to defend peace. Madam Krupskaya called for a struggle to stop the wars of aggression in Korea and Vietnam. She said: It is not enough to merely condemn the crimes of the imperialists; it is necessary to prevent the transportation of troops and weapons to these countries. She emphasized the struggle of the people of all countries against the imperialists' arming of Germany and Japan, and expressed her conviction that the forces of peace and democracy will surely triumph. The Council held a heated discussion on this report from the 1st to the 3rd.

　　At the meeting on the 3rd, Danish women's representative Olson delivered a report on the second item on the agenda. On the 4th, Italian representative Longo delivered a report on expanding the movement to protect children, pointing out that children in capitalist countries live in poverty and hunger as a result of war preparations. In Greece, thousands of children are imprisoned in concentration camps, and in Korea, one-third of those killed by American aggression are children. At present, it is extremely necessary for women in all countries to expand the movement to protect children. The discussion concluded on the 5th. That evening, the Council attended a reception hosted by Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

　　The Council passed a resolution strongly protesting the French government's ban on the Women's International Democratic Federation's activities in France.

　　在国际妇联理事会议上
    古久里夫人发表报告       
    号召制止侵略朝鲜和越南的战争
    【新华社六日讯】柏林消息：一月三十一日开始在柏林举行的国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议，主要议程有下列四项：（一）贯彻世界和平大会决议；（二）加强国际妇女运动的一致行动；（三）扩大保卫儿童运动；（四）吸收新会员。
    国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人就议程第一项发表报告时指出：国际民主妇联当前的主要任务是吸收千百万妇女参加保卫和平的运动。古久里夫人号召为制止在朝鲜和越南的侵略战争而斗争。她说：仅仅谴责帝国主义者的罪行是不够的，必须阻止把军队和武器运到这些国家去。她强调指出各国人民反对帝国主义者武装德国和日本的斗争，并表示确信和平、民主的力量必然胜利。从一日到三日，理事会热烈讨论了这一报告。
    在三日的会议上，丹麦妇女代表奥尔逊就议程的第二项发表报告。四日，意大利代表朗戈发表了关于扩大保卫儿童运动的报告，她指出：资本主义国家的儿童由于备战的结果在贫穷饥饿中生活。在希腊有成千的儿童囚在集中营内，在朝鲜由于美国侵略而被杀死的人中有三分之一是儿童。目前各国妇女扩大保卫儿童的运动极为必要。讨论至五日始告结束。当晚理事会出席了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的招待会。
    理事会通过了决议，严正抗议法国政府禁止国际民主妇联在法国活动。
