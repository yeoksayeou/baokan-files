Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: The Thai government, under the instigation of American imperialism, illegally arrested the person in charge of the newspaper "Quanmin Bao" (All People's News), published by patriotic overseas Chinese, and is plotting further large-scale persecution of overseas Chinese. In response, the spokesperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government issued the following statement:

Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and the Thai government signed aggressive economic and military agreements with the United States, the Thai government has more openly obeyed American imperialism, further persecuted our overseas Chinese in Thailand, and antagonized the Chinese people.

Recently, the Thai government, using the excuse that "Quanmin Bao," published by patriotic overseas Chinese in Bangkok, published news of the local overseas Chinese anti-American patriotic movement, illegally arrested Cai Zhihong, the editor-in-chief of "Quanmin Bao," and Wu Jianzhong, the publisher of the newspaper, and declared that they would be deported. "Quanmin Bao" has always advocated defending world and Far Eastern peace, promoting friendship between the Chinese and Thai people, and resolutely safeguarding the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and is deeply loved by the local overseas Chinese. However, the Thai government has continuously threatened and persecuted it. In January of this year, the Thai government unreasonably confiscated a calendar published by "Quanmin Bao" with the national flag of the People's Republic of China printed on it. This behavior of the Thai government fully demonstrates its hostility towards the Chinese people.

Prior to this, the Thai government had already unreasonably closed hundreds of overseas Chinese schools, devastated overseas Chinese industry and commerce, and expelled our overseas Chinese; recently, it has also conspired to expand and re-enact the "restricted area" system of vicious anti-Chinese discrimination from 1941. According to the "Restricted Area Ordinance" that has been submitted to the Thai parliament, eighteen provinces in Thailand with a high concentration of overseas Chinese will be designated as "restricted areas," and the numerous overseas Chinese residing in the "restricted areas" will be forced to move out. Once this ordinance is implemented, our vast number of overseas Chinese will be displaced and unable to make a living.

Our overseas Chinese in Thailand are now righteously demanding that the Thai government release the illegally arrested persons in charge of "Quanmin Bao" and guarantee freedom of speech and other legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. The people of our country and all fair-minded people support these legitimate and reasonable demands.

We express our stern protest against the Thai government's increasingly outrageous and brutal acts of destroying the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. We firmly demand that the Thai government immediately release the persons in charge of "Quanmin Bao," stop all illegal measures to persecute overseas Chinese, and guarantee all legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

　　我中央人民政府侨委会发言人发表谈话        
    严正抗议泰国政府迫害华侨
    坚决要求立即释放《全民报》负责人，保障华侨正当权益，停止一切迫害华侨的非法措施。
    【新华社十六日讯】泰国政府在美帝国主义指使下，非法逮捕我爱国侨胞出版的报纸《全民报》负责人，并阴谋进一步大规模迫害华侨。为此，我中央人民政府华侨事务委员会发言人特发表谈话如下：
    自从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，泰国政府与美国订立了侵略性的经济、军事协定后，泰国政府即更公开地听命美帝国主义，进一步迫害我旅泰侨胞，与中国人民为敌。
    最近，泰国政府借口我爱国侨胞在曼谷出版的《全民报》刊登了当地华侨反美爱国运动的新闻，非法逮捕《全民报》的总编辑蔡志宏及该报出版人吴建中，并声言要将他们驱逐出境。《全民报》一向主张保卫世界与远东和平，促进中、泰人民的友谊，严正维护华侨权益，深受当地侨胞爱护。但泰国政府却不断加以威胁和迫害。今年一月，泰国政府曾无理没收《全民报》出版的印有中华人民共和国国旗的日历。泰国政府这种行为，充分表明了它对中国人民的敌视。
    泰国政府在此以前已无理封闭我数百所华侨学校，摧残我华侨工商业，驱逐我侨胞；最近，又阴谋扩大重演其一九四一年恶毒的排华的“禁区”制度。按照已在泰国国会中提出的“禁区条例”，华侨密集的泰国十八个府将被划为“禁区”，居住在“禁区”内的众多华侨，悉将被迫迁出。这一条例一旦实施，我广大侨胞势将流离失所。无以为生。
    我旅泰侨胞现正据理要求泰国政府释放被非法逮捕的《全民报》负责人，保障华侨言论自由及其他正当权益。我国人民及一切公正人士都支持这些正当的合理的要求。
    我们对于泰国政府变本加厉摧残华侨正当权益的横暴行为，表示严正的抗议。我们坚决要求泰国政府立即释放《全民报》的负责人，停止一切迫害华侨的非法措施，保障华侨的一切正当权益。
