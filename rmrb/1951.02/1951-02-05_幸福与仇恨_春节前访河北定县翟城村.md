　　Happiness and Hatred
    ——Visiting Zhaicheng Village, Ding County, Hebei Before the Spring Festival
    Jian Wei, Xiu Xue
    Although there are still a few days before the Spring Festival, as soon as you enter Zhaicheng Village, it feels like the Spring Festival is just around the corner. Groups of children are jumping and singing in the streets, some eagerly wearing their new colorful clothes and hats. All the mills and grinders in the village are turning non-stop day and night, and every family is busy preparing rice and flour for steaming New Year cakes and making dumplings. Late at night, the windows of many homes are still lit, and women are rushing to make new clothes overnight. Young wives and unmarried girls, in addition to milling and sewing, also take on roles in the village drama troupe. The sound of gongs and drums is constantly heard on the streets. The village drama troupe, with nearly a hundred members, is rehearsing a new play to be performed during the Spring Festival.
    Almost every family in this village of more than five hundred households has bought a lot of New Year goods. The peasants' demand for New Year goods has greatly exceeded the supply and marketing cooperative's expectations. As soon as the twelfth lunar month began, the village supply and marketing cooperative prepared a large amount of New Year goods. In addition to coal and salt, they also prepared a large amount of red dates, white wine, porcelain pots, and tea bowls. In addition, they specially transported a thousand catties of high-quality vermicelli from Shanxi. These goods were sold out soon after they arrived at the cooperative. Four thousand catties of red dates were far from meeting the needs of the cooperative members, because they needed to steam a lot of New Year cakes. Old middle peasant Mi Yaotang bought an entire bolt of foreign cloth, and all eight members of his family made new clothes.
    Mi Laoyou, who had worked for the landlord since he was thirteen, wandered for thirty years, and finally returned to the village with a load of broken belongings, excitedly led reporters to visit his newly built, spacious, and bright five-room new house. This was built on the house foundation he received during the land reform. New white cotton cloth curtains hang on the door, and the house is full of sunshine. Mi Laoyou's wife is rushing to make new blue cotton clothes for the two children.
    The peasants of Zhaicheng Village understand that this happy and beautiful life has been exchanged for blood and labor. Everyone in the village, adults and children, knows "June 2nd" (lunar calendar) - this thrilling and bloody day. That was ten years ago, on June 2, 1940 (lunar calendar), when the Japanese devils suddenly surrounded the village, gathered hundreds of men, women, and children in a large courtyard, set up machine guns opposite them, and forced them to ask who were the anti-Japanese cadres. The unyielding people did not say a word. The beasts started the machine guns, and the crowd immediately fell in piles of blood! After repeated sweeps, fifty-five people had died and three were seriously injured. When the machine gun was started for the third time, a quick-witted peasant stood up, pointed to the pile of corpses and said to the "translator": "This is the anti-Japanese village chief!" "That is the chairman of the peasant association!" This is how the survivors were preserved.
    The people of Zhaicheng Village, who have gone through catastrophe and suffering, have a stronger desire to build their own beautiful lives. Their indignation and anger at the US imperialist aggression against Korea and the conspiracy to rearm Japan is indescribable. Now, the people of the whole village are specially making honorable red lanterns and couplets for the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in the village, and the women are helping some elderly families of revolutionary soldiers to sew new clothes. They are even more concerned about the People's Volunteers fighting on the ice and snow front in Korea. The village has prepared a large number of condolences and letters of condolences. Zhang Zengpu, who lost his old father in the "June 2" massacre and whose left leg was pierced by Japanese bullets, stroked the still aching scar and said: "I understand everything in my heart. Today's situation has been exchanged for blood and flesh. As long as the higher authorities give an order, we will go no matter if it is water or fire."

　　幸福与仇恨
    ——春节前访河北定县翟城村
    建伟　修学
    虽然离春节还有几天，但是一走进翟城村，就好像春节明天就要来临的样子。街头上成群的孩子跳着、唱着，有的急不能待地早把花衣新帽穿戴上。全村所有的碾、磨，日夜不停地转动着，家家都忙着准备蒸年糕、包饺子的米面。深夜，不少家的窗户还闪着灯光，妇女们正在连夜赶做新衣裳。年青的媳妇和未婚的姑娘，除碾磨缝衣之外，不少还担任着村剧团的角色。街道上不时传来锣鼓声，拥有近百个团员的村剧团，正在赶排将在春节上演的新剧。
    这个五百多户的村子，差不多家家都买了不少年货。农民们对年货的需要竟大大超过供销社的预计。一入腊月，村供销社就筹办了大批年货，除煤炭、食盐之外，还办了大批红枣、白酒、瓷壶、茶碗等，此外还特地从山西运来了一千斤上等粉条。这些货物到社不久就被购买一空。四千斤红枣，远不够社员的要求，因为他们要蒸大量的年糕。老中农米耀堂，买了一整匹洋布，一家八口人全做了新衣服。
    从十三岁就给地主扛活，颠沛流浪三十年最后担着一担烂家当回到村来的米老友，兴奋地引着记者到他刚刚盖成的宽敞明亮的五间新屋内参观。这是他在土地改革中分的房基上盖成的。房门上挂着新白洋布门帘，屋内阳光充沛，米老友的媳妇正在给两个孩子赶做蓝洋布新棉衣。
    翟城村的农民们懂得这样幸福、美好的生活，是用血和劳动换来的。全村大人、娃娃，没有一个人不知道“六月初二”（农历）——这个惊心动魄的血腥的日子。那是十年前，一九四○年的六月二日（农历），日本鬼子突然包围了村庄，把数百男女老幼集在一个大院里，对面架起机枪，逼问谁是抗日干部。不屈的人们谁也不发一言，野兽们开动了机枪，人群立即成堆地倒在血泊里！这样反复扫射了两次，已经有五十五个人死掉，三个人重伤。机关枪第三次开动时，一个急中生智的农民，站起来指着尸堆向“翻译官”说：“这个是抗日村长！”“那个是农会主席！”这样才把残余的人保全了下来。
    经过浩劫与苦难的翟城村人民，对于建设自己美好的生活更怀着强烈的愿望。他们对美帝国主义侵朝及重新武装日本的阴谋的愤慨与激怒是没法形容的。现在，全村人民正在给本村的烈士家属和革命军人家属们特制了光荣红灯和对联，妇女们则帮助一些年老的革命军人家属缝制新衣。他们更惦记在朝鲜冰雪前线作战的人民志愿军，村中现已准备好大批慰问品和慰问信。曾在“六、二”惨案中丧失老父、被日寇子弹穿透左腿的张增朴，抚摸着至今仍发疼的伤疤说：“我心里什么都明白，今天的光景是血肉换来的，只要上级号召一声，不管水里火里咱都马上去。”
