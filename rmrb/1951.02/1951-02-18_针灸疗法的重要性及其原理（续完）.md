   IV. Why Can Acupuncture Cure Diseases?

Using acupuncture to treat diseases, whether it is piercing nerves with needles, bloodletting needles, skin needles, thread embedding (inserting a thread into the skin at acupoints, hanging copper coins to promote suppuration), or fire needles (heating the needle red and inserting it), whether it is non-scarring moxibustion or scarring moxibustion, suppurative moxibustion, it can cure diseases mainly because it stimulates and adjusts the body's internal nerve regulation and control functions.

Why can stimulating and adjusting nerve function cure diseases? This needs to be explained briefly from the beginning:

The human body is a large collective of hundreds of millions of living cells. These living cells have a very strict division of labor and organization; divided into digestion, respiration, excretion, circulation, movement, reproduction and other departments. These departments are unified and regulated by nerves. Therefore, the various departments can cooperate with each other and produce adaptive changes in response to different situations. For example, when it is hot, the blood vessels on the body surface dilate and sweat, so that the body temperature can be quickly dissipated, preventing the body temperature from rising. When it is cold, the opposite happens: the blood vessels on the body surface contract, the sweat pores close tightly, and the hairs stand on end, so that the body temperature is reduced to avoid lowering the body temperature. Also, during strenuous exercise, the heartbeat and breathing naturally speed up, stimulating the blood to transport a large amount of nutrients and oxygen to the muscles to supply muscle consumption. When sleeping, the opposite is true: breathing and heartbeat are slower than usual, so that the body's nutrient consumption can be saved. This change is directed and regulated by nerves. This is a phenomenon in which the normal functioning of the nervous system can ensure normal physiological changes throughout the body.

If the body is damaged, when the nervous system functions well, it can cause a stress response in the body, resist this damage, and repair the body. For example, if there is a wound on the body, white blood cells that devour bacteria in the body will quickly increase, the blood vessels near the wound will dilate, and a large number of white blood cells will flock to the wound to devour the cells that died due to the injury and the bacteria that invaded from the wound. At the same time, nutrients and stimulants brought by the plasma seep out in large quantities from the microvessels, supplying the needs of the cells near the wound, and promoting them to speed up growth, reproduce new cells, and grow granulation tissue to fill the wound. The nature and quantity of the leakage of nutrients and stimulants from the microvessels are controlled by the cells at the seepage outlet, and that cell is dominated by nerves. The nerves perceive differently the occurrence and subsequent development changes of the wound, and can give different adjustments. When the wound is healed and the nerve's perception is normal, the repair work will naturally stop.

After bacteria enter the body, if they release toxins to resist the phagocytosis of white blood cells, the nerves perceive it and immediately cause a stress response, the body temperature rises, and the activity of the bacteria is restricted. At the same time, the production of white blood cells increases, and some even cause vomiting and diarrhea at the same time. This has the effect of removing spoiled food in the stomach or food that the body cannot bear.

Under the command of the nerves, the body also has a powerful "compensatory effect." For example, if one kidney is removed, the other kidney will enlarge twice its original size because the workload has increased stimulating the nerves.

Therefore, if a person's nerves are healthy and can well command the body's anti-disease, repair, and compensation functions, most of the external aggressions can be eliminated and the body's health restored. Of course, this stress response of the nerves must also rely on other conditions of the body and be subject to certain restrictions by other conditions. For example, it must have sufficient physical strength to be dispatched; the changes in the damaged part must also be at a stage where it has not reached an irreversible degree. The nerves themselves are also affected by other conditions of the body, and the whole body is weak, and it is difficult for it to be uniquely healthy. In particular, mental depression, worry, and fear have a significant impact on it. Some people who are lovelorn even develop serious gastrointestinal diseases, and can recover suddenly after love is restored. It is even more common for people who are chronically depressed to have poor metabolism in the body, resulting in weakness throughout the body.

If the nerve is damaged and its function is abnormal, the lesions caused in the body are also very different due to the nature and location of the damage. Such as local inflammation, suppuration, ulceration, systemic discomfort, chills, fever, and so on.

This damage can be caused by mechanical methods (such as damaging the trigeminal nerve of a rabbit, which can cause corneal ulcers), or by excessive stimulation of cold and heat, lack of vitamins, stimulation of drugs, or stimulation of bacterial toxins.

Sometimes, because the stress response measures are carried out excessively, it can also cause damage to the body. For example, vomiting and diarrhea in cholera can cause the body to lose too much water, leading to death. More severe dry cholera is caused by the paralysis of nerve function, and people die before vomiting and diarrhea can even occur.

Some external stimuli are not serious, but because the nerve is hypersensitive, causing excessive stress changes, it has also become a disease. For example, some people get lacquer sores when they come into contact with the smell of lacquer; smelling certain pollen, or using a small amount of certain drugs or eating certain foods, can also cause a serious illness.

Throughout history, treatment methods, whether using drugs or physical therapy, some eliminate external causes (such as sterilization), and many adjust nerve function (such as the sweating effect of aspirin, and digitalis for treating heart failure). As for vaccination, it can be regarded as an exercise for the nerve function, so that when it encounters the stimulation of a certain toxin in the future, it can direct the antibody-producing tissue to produce effective antibodies.

In the past, for the treatment of many diseases, although it was actually adjusting nerve function, in terms of understanding, this treatment route was not taken seriously. Many diseases cured in this way were given other explanations. Or it is given a formalistic name and regarded as an explanation. Although some therapies have been corroborated by obvious facts and cannot but be admitted to be the effect of adjusting nerves, this has never been used as a scientific way to find treatment methods, so most of the therapies in this area are still derived from experience.

In the past, the reason why this treatment route was ignored in theory was that the basic theory of past medicine—cellular pathology—did not pay enough attention to the role of nerves in the body; it was believed that any pathological phenomenon was caused by certain stimuli (such as bacterial toxins, or chemical and physical stimuli) that damaged cells. Therefore, pathology mainly studies various degenerations of cells and tissues (such as fatty degeneration, protein degeneration, glass degeneration, inflammation, abscesses, ulcers, etc.), and believes that these changes are direct reactions of cells to stimuli. This is a one-sided, fragmented view that only looks at the phenomenon and not the essence.

In our opinion, the disease process is the process by which various tissues of the body, under the command of the nerves, jointly fight against external aggressions and repair themselves. This includes the damage and repair of nerve function; and the tissue damage caused by disordered command when nerve function is damaged. When this kind of nerve disorder reaches a serious level, it will lead to the failure of the entire struggle, and the result is death.

Acupuncture therapy does not directly confront external causes, and therefore does not focus on direct treatment of the affected tissue, but stimulates and adjusts nerve function to achieve the purpose of treating diseases. Therefore, acupuncture can often remove two symptoms in different directions using the same acupoint (such as "can cause sweating when there is no sweat, and stop sweating when there is sweat"). In the early stage of inflammation, when white blood cells need to increase, but cannot increase smoothly, acupuncture can increase them; conversely, in the later stage of inflammation, acupuncture at the same acupoints can also make white blood cells decrease normally, and the inflammatory exudate can be quickly absorbed.

Many vitamin deficiency diseases are actually not caused by a complete lack of vitamins in the food, but because the body's ability to absorb that vitamin is not strong. This weakening of absorption function is often due to some dysfunction of the nerves related to it. Therefore, for many of these diseases, not giving foods that are particularly rich in vitamins, but performing acupuncture, can also have a great effect. For the same reason, acupuncture can also be effective for some diseases with endocrine gland secretion disorders.

Acupuncture's excitement and sedation of nerves is also stimulating the nerve's own repair, adjustment, and compensation functions. Therefore, if there is no continued influence of external causes, acupuncture has an excellent effect on the excitement and sedation of nerves. In the past, diseases for which no definite external cause could be found were often attributed to heredity, and there were not many ways to treat them, such as certain gastric ulcers, epilepsy, syncope, etc., and acupuncture can also have a greater effect.

The excitement of nerves stimulated by acupuncture often radiates to a large area, and adjustment effects occur in a large area. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of acupuncture is often not limited to the vicinity of the acupoint and along the nerve pathway, but can affect a very far and wide area. Such as stimulating the toes can affect the head. Therefore, stimulating an acupoint is not specifically for treating one disease, but for adjusting the nerve function of that related part, and can have more or less effect on diseases of the related part.

As for suppurative moxibustion, thread embedding, which creates sterile suppuration on the skin, and the therapeutic principles of bloodletting therapy, large bloodletting therapy (as well as cupping and scraping to cause subcutaneous congestion), are also the stimulation of nerve adjustment and stress response functions. Because the body suffers from this kind of injury, the nerve's stress response function will be greatly excited. In the past, there were also autologous blood therapy methods of injecting one's own blood into the muscles, and methods of injecting sterile milk, which could achieve a certain therapeutic effect. Soviet medical scientists have even created "tissue therapy," such as transplanting skin that has been frozen for a long time on ulcers, or cutting a small piece on the skin, lifting it up, making it close to death, thereby stimulating the nerve's regulatory function. This is basically the same principle as suppurative moxibustion and thread embedding.

Soviet medical scientists, starting from the stimulation of nerve regulation function, also created "brain massage" to stimulate the spinal cord by drawing spinal fluid and indirectly stimulating the brain; and "spinal block" to stimulate the nerve ganglia beside the spine with anesthetics. It has a great effect on many diseases.

Therefore, acupuncture therapy is not only reasonable, but also, from the perspective of new medical concepts, it is of great research value. It can provide rich materials for the research of new neuropathology, and after scientific research, it may be combined with other therapies to exert greater effects and enrich and supplement modern medicine. In this research, our Chinese medical community has more convenient opportunities. Therefore, further research on the principles and techniques of acupuncture therapy should be a glorious task for our Chinese medical community.

            V. The Purpose of Acupuncture

The purposes of acupuncture in treating diseases are divided into three types: inhibition, excitation, and induction.

    (1) Inhibition Method (also known as Sedation Method).

The so-called inhibition method is to give a persistent strong stimulus to inhibit, relieve, contract, and stop when life functions such as muscles, nerves, secretion, and blood are hyperactive. For example: due to hyperactivity of sensory nerve function, causing allergies and pain, and because of excitation of motor nerve function, causing spasm and twitching, give it a relieving effect. When blood vessels dilate, it can be adjusted to make them contract. To achieve this goal, one or several needles (the needles can be thicker) can be used to pierce several acupoints, and strong and persistent stimulation can be given using the pounding technique and multiple lying needles.

    (2) Excitation Method

Completely opposite to the inhibition method, some diseases are caused by weakening of life functions, and methods are used to give weak or moderate stimuli to produce a promoting effect. For example: numbness and paralysis of sensory nerves and motor nerves are adjusted. Paralysis of autonomic nerves is restored to normal. Weak stimulation can incite life functions, and moderate stimulation can awaken vigorous life functions. This method uses slightly thinner needles, and the needle technique is light twisting and not much lying needles, giving weak and short stimulation.

    (3) Induction Method

The so-called induction method is to acupuncture at a part far from the affected part, so that the nerves in that part are excited and the blood vessels are dilated, to induce the blood and disease products in the affected part to heal the disease. For example: for deep inflammation, congestion, and blood stasis, acupuncture is given on the surface or in remote parts. For example, for cerebral congestion, the sensory nerves of the limbs are stimulated, causing a reflex action, so that the nerves that constrict the blood vessels in the brain can exert their function to expel the cerebral congestion. In this method, the needle technique is to twist and lie down repeatedly.

The inhibition method, excitation method, and induction method are also to achieve inhibition, excitation, and induction effects. Acupuncture is divided into direct stimulation and indirect stimulation. Directly stimulating the nerves and muscles of the affected area can achieve the therapeutic purpose; giving a shallow stimulus to the skin and the ends of the sensory nerves is indirect stimulation (reflex action), which can also achieve the purpose. However, because the part where the reflex action is manifested can reach a wider range than local stimulation, it is better than direct stimulation for certain diseases.

            VI. Techniques and the Issue of "Tonification and Purgation"

The same acupoint nerve, due to the severity, duration, and twisting direction of the stimulation, has different effects. How do we make the stimulation just right? As mentioned earlier, to achieve a calming effect, we use strong and persistent stimulation; to achieve an excitatory effect, we use slight and short stimulation. This has not fully explained the technique, and there are many subtle points that need to be further studied. Ancient acupuncture books call this issue "tonification, purgation, following and welcoming." "Welcoming" also means purgation, and "following" also means tonification. They attach great importance to "tonifying deficiency and purging excess": "If the qi is not correct, and the pulse does not jump, it needs to be tonified. When the qi is strong, it needs to be purged." Saying that a deficiency state needs to be tonified is equivalent to what we say as persistent heavy stimulation. Saying that a state of excess needs to be purged is equivalent to short and light stimulation. However, it is believed that there is a kind of "qi" in the human body, and that "qi" is directed by "spirit" (qi is the messenger of the spirit), and blood is directed by "qi" (the one who moves blood is qi, and qi is the teacher of blood). "Spirit" is the thing that generates thought, and actions are caused by thought. They believe that it is "spirit" that causes "qi" to reach the limbs, causing movement. This is something that ancient people did not know about the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, and they imagined it based on experience. They believed that the different effects of acupuncture were due to purging or tonifying qi. Based on experience and imagination, they created various methods of tonifying and purging qi. The things that are groped out of experience are generally useful and can also be explained scientifically; the things with a large component of imagination generally have no effect. For example, the technique of purgation, "tight lifting and slow pressing" and "one in and three out," all indicate that the stimulation should be light, which is correct. As for twisting, twisting six times and pausing for a while is purgation, because "six" is an "yin number" (in the past, even numbers were regarded as yin numbers, and odd numbers were regarded as yang numbers). It is also said that when removing the needle, remove the needle quickly and shake the needle hole to make it bigger, and do not rub it to close it, so that "evil qi" can be purged. The so-called "quickly remove the needle surface and do not close the hole" is difficult to believe and does not seem to have any effect in reality.

It is said on the method of tonification that "slow lifting and tight pressing," "three in and one out," and "accumulating and picking to the right, accumulating and picking to the left" all refer to heavy stimulation, which can be said to make sense. As for performing the "number of ninety-nine" (twisting the needle nine times each time) and slowly removing the needle, and making the needle hole small, the so-called "gradually removing the needle surface and quickly closing the hole," although it is also correct, saying that the "number of ninety-nine" can "tonify," and that "quickly closing the hole" is to prevent "qi" from running away, etc., are equally difficult to believe. Some acupuncturists have also experienced that "the number of tonification and purgation does not depend on the duration or quantity, but on the severity of the disease," and the improvement of the disease is the criterion.

As for the direction of needle rotation, some ancient books believe that when needling the left side of the body, twisting from right to left is tonification, and twisting from left to right is purgation; needling the right side is the opposite, the so-called "tonify with forward rotation, and purge with reverse rotation." Some also believe that this is not necessary. This is because left and right rotation often show different effects, but acupoints on the same line that are very close to each other do not necessarily have the same effect every time when twisting in the same direction. Because the needle tip sometimes pricks on the left side of the nerve and sometimes on the right side, the effect of twisting in the same direction on the nerve cannot be the same, so it is impossible to make rigid regulations.

So, what should we do? This mainly relies on constantly asking about the patient's feelings and observing the changes in the disease. For example, if the spasms and pain are reduced when rotating more to the left, and vice versa, then rotate more to the left. The specific degree of stimulation is also considered in this way. Some require the patient to feel comfortable and light, so try according to this standard to see how to turn and how to pound to make the patient most comfortable. For example, to treat a male patient with facial nerve spasm, needling the Sibai acupoint on the side of the spasm, when turning to the left, the right eye and corner of the mouth twitched more severely; when turning to the right, the twitching stopped. So, after turning slightly to the right, the needle was left in place. After twenty minutes, the needle was turned to the right and removed, and he recovered immediately. In addition, for another male with the same disease, when the Sibai acupoint was needled, it spasmed more when turned to the right, and stopped immediately when turned to the left. However, the spasms could not be overcome when the circle was turned too large; only a very slight twist to the left stopped the spasms. Until the needle was removed, the method of slight leftward rotation was used, and the disease also disappeared immediately. There was also a female patient whose left facial nerve spasmed, and the symptom was twitching of the upper and lower eyelids of the left eye, which sometimes interfered with seeing things. Repeated acupuncture around the eye socket could stop the twitching, but it returned to normal after the needle was removed. Later, acupuncture at acupoints such as Sanyinjiao and Diji to regulate menstruation improved the facial twitching somewhat. If a certain part of the patient needs to feel sore and tired during acupuncture, remove the needle when it is sore and tired (see the epistaxis patient in the treatment section on eye, nose, and ear diseases).

What if there is no obvious reaction? The severity of the stimulation can be derived from experience, and the direction of twisting should generally be more to the left and more to the right, which is the so-called "even tonification and even purgation." While paying attention to the technique, we must also pay attention to whether the selected acupoints are effective for the disease. For example, an old gentleman suffered from stomach disease for many years. During acupuncture treatment, the pain stopped, he did not suffer from insomnia at night, and his appetite and digestion were very good. He was needled once a day or every other day, and the acupoints were needled on the waist, back, abdomen, and limbs in rotation. According to the records, he felt the best after needling Zusanli, Weishu, and Geshu acupoints each time, especially after needling and moxibustion at Weishu, Geshu, and Zhongwan acupoints. Later, he was given acupuncture and moxibustion more often at these acupoints that were particularly effective for him.

　　针灸疗法的重要性及其原理（续完）
　　朱琏
            四  针灸为什么能治病
    用针灸术治病，不论是刺神经的针与出血针，或皮肤针、串线针（在穴位的皮肤上，串入一线，坠以铜钱，促使化脓）、火针（将针烧红刺入），也不论是无瘢痕灸或有瘢痕灸、化脓灸，它所以能治病，主要是由于激发和调整身体内部神经的调节和管制的机能。
    为什么激发和调整了神经的机能就能把病治好呢？这得概略的从头说起：
    人体是多少万万个活细胞的大集体。这些活细胞之间，有很严密的分工和组织；分有消化、呼吸、排泄、循环、运动、生殖等部门。这些部门都由神经来统一管理和调节。所以平时各部门之间，能互相配合，遇到各种不同的情况，能产生适应的变化。譬如热的时候，体表的血管就扩张，出汗，使体温很快放散，免得体温上升。冷的时候则相反，体表的血管收缩，汗孔闭紧，寒毛竖起，使体温减少放散，免得体温降低。又如剧烈运动的时候，心跳、呼吸自然加快，鼓动血液，运送大量的养料、氧气到肌肉里，供给肌肉的消耗。睡觉的时候则相反，呼吸、心跳都比平时减缓，身体内的养料消耗就能节省。这种变化，都是由神经来指挥调节的。这是神经系统机能正常，能够保证全身正常的生理变化的现象。
    身体如果受了损害，神经系统机能健全时，就能在身体内引起一种应变的变化，抵抗这种损害，把身体修复起来。譬如身上有了破伤，身体里面吞食细菌的白血球就很快增多，伤口附近的血管扩张，白血球大量拥到伤口附近，吞食因伤致死了的细胞，和从伤口侵入的细菌。同时血浆带来的养料和刺激素，大量的从微血管中渗出，供给伤口附近细胞的需要，并促使它加紧生长，生殖新的细胞，长出肉芽，把伤口长满。微血管中养料和刺激素的渗出，其性质和数量，都受渗出口的细胞管制，而那种细胞，则又是受神经支配的。伤口的产生以及以后的发展变化，神经的感受不同，就能给以不同的调节。伤口平复，神经的感受正常了，修复工作也就很自然的停止了。
    细菌进入身体以后，若是放出毒素来抵抗白血球的吞食，神经感受到了，马上就引起应变的变化，体温上升，细菌的活动即受到限制，同时白血球产量增加，有的还同时引起吐泻，这有排除肠胃里变坏了的食物，或是身体负担不了的食物的作用。
    在神经指挥之下，身体内还有强大的“代偿作用”。比如肾脏割掉一个，另一肾脏就会因为工作加重，刺激神经，神经立即在那一部分，引起应变的变化，使那部分的微血管渗出大量养料和刺激素，使那个肾脏长大一倍。心脏瓣膜发炎、结疤以后，闭锁不全，每次搏动射出的血液不够，心搏加快，负担加重，心脏也会因而长大。
    所以人体的神经健全，能很好的来指挥身体内的抗病、修复、代偿的机能时，外因的侵害大都能被消灭，恢复身体的健康。当然，神经的这种应变作用，还得依靠身体的其他条件，并受其他条件的一定限制。比如它要有足够的体力可供调度；受损害的局部，其变化还要在未到不可恢复的程度。神经本身，也受身体其他条件的影响，整个身体衰弱，它也难独特的健康。尤其是精神的抑郁、烦忧、恐惧，对它的影响更是显著，有些失恋的人，竟然发生严重的肠胃病，爱情一恢复，又可以霍然而愈。一般长期忧郁的人，体内新陈代谢不畅旺，因而全身疲弱，这更是常见的事。
    神经有了损害，机能不正常时，由于损害的性质、部位的不同，在身上引起的病变也很不同。如局部的发炎、化脓、溃疡，全身的违和、发冷、发热等等。
    这种损害，可以由机械的方法造成（如损伤兔子的三叉神经，能引起角膜溃疡），也可由冷热的过度刺激、维他命的缺乏、药品的刺激，或细菌毒素的刺激造成。
    有时由于应变的措施进行得过度，也能引起对身体的伤害。如霍乱的吐泻，就可以使身体过度的损失水份，以致死亡。更严重的干性霍乱，由于神经机能被麻痹了，连吐泻都来不及发生，人就死了。
    有些外因的刺激并不严重，可是由于神经的感应过敏，引起了过度的应变变化，也曾成为疾病。如有些人沾到漆的气味就生漆疮；嗅到某种花粉，或用到少量的某种药品或吃到某种食物，也会大病一场。
    历来治病的方法，不论是用药物或理学疗法，有些是祛除外因（如杀菌），也有很多是对神经机能的调整（如阿司匹灵的发汗，毛地黄的治心脏衰弱）。至于疫苗的接种，则可看成对于神经机能的锻炼，使它以后遇到某种毒素的刺激，能指挥产生抗体的组织，产生有效的抗体。
    过去对于许多病的治疗，虽说实际上是调整神经机能，但是认识上却对这种治疗途径，极不重视。许多经过这样治愈的病，被作了另外的解释。或是给定一个形式主义的名称，就当做解释。部分的疗法虽被明显的事实所佐证，不能不承认是调整神经的功效，但是这总没有被作为一个科学地寻找治疗方法的道路，所以这方面的疗法，大都还是由经验得来。
    过去在学理上的所以忽视这个治疗途径，是由于过去医学的基础理论——细胞病理学，对于神经在身体内的作用重视不够；认为任何病理现象，都是由于某些刺激（如细菌毒素，或化学的、物理的刺激），使细胞损害了的缘故。因此病理学中，主要研究的是细胞组织的各种变性（如脂肪变性、蛋白变性、玻璃变性、炎症、脓疡、溃疡等等），认为这些变化，都是细胞直接对刺激的反应。这是片面的、割裂的，只看现象，不看本质的看法。
    在我们看来，疾病的过程，是身体各部组织在神经指挥之下，共同和外来侵害斗争、修复自己的过程。这里面包括神经机能的被损害与修复；以及神经机能被损害时，指挥紊乱造成的组织破坏。这种神经的紊乱到了严重的程度，就会引起整个斗争的失败，结果是死亡。
    针灸疗法，不是直接以外因为对手，因而也不着重对患部组织直接的治疗，而是激发与调整神经机能，以达到治病的目的。所以针灸用同样的穴位，常常能去掉两种方向不同的病征（如“无汗能发，有汗则止”）。在炎症初期，白血球需要增多，而不能顺利增多时，针灸以后，就能增多；反之，到了炎症后期，针灸同样的穴位，又能使白血球正常地减少，炎症的渗出物便能很快的吸收。
    有许多维他命缺乏病，实际上并不是由于食物里面完全缺乏了维他命之故，而是由于体内吸收那种维他命的机能不强的缘故。这种吸收机能的减弱，又常常是由于与它相关的神经的机能有些失常所致。因此，对于许多这类的病，不给以维他命特别丰富的食物，但行针灸，也能收到很大效果。依同样理由，有好些内分泌腺分泌失常的病，针灸也能收效。
    针灸对神经的兴奋、镇静，同时也是激发神经对本身的修复、调整、代偿机能。所以如果没有外因的继续影响，针灸对于神经的兴奋与镇静，效果极好。过去对于找不出确实外因的病，常常归因于遗传，没有好多办法医治，如某些胃溃疡、癫痫、失心风等等，针灸也能收到较大的效果。
    神经受到针灸的刺激，兴奋的传布常常放散到很大的范围，在很大的范围内，发生调整作用。所以针灸的治效，常不限于穴位附近和神经径路的沿线，而可以影响很远很广。如刺脚趾，可以影响到头部。因此刺激一个穴位功效也不是专治一种病，而是调整那个有关部位的神经机能，对有关部位的疾病，都能发生或多或少的效果。
    至于化脓灸、串线针，在皮肤上造成无菌的化脓，以及出血疗法，大放血疗法（以及拔火罐、刮痧造成皮下郁血）的治疗原理，也是对于神经调整、应变机能的激发。因为身体受了这类损伤，神经的这种应变的机能是会大大兴奋起来的。过去也就有将自己的血液注入肌肉的自血疗法，和注入无菌的牛奶的疗法，都能达到一定的治疗功效。苏联医学者更创造了“组织疗法”，如在溃疡上面移植冰藏了很久的皮肤，或在皮肤上切起小小一片，把它翘起，使它接近死亡，从而刺激神经的调节机能。这和化脓灸、串线针的原理，基本上是一样的。
    苏联医学者从激发神经调节机能着眼，还创造了抽脊髓液来刺激脊髓、间接刺激大脑的“大脑按摩术”；用麻醉剂刺激脊椎旁面神经节的“脊椎封锁术”。对很多疾病收效很大。
    所以针灸疗法，不但是有道理的，而且按新的医学观点看来，它是极有研究价值的。它能对新的神经病理学的研究，提供丰富的材料，它在科学研究以后，还可能与其他疗法结合，发挥更大的效果，丰富与充实现代的医学。在这种研究中，我们中国的医学界是有着更便利的机会的。所以对于针灸疗法的原理与技术之进一步研究，应该是我们中国医学界的一个光荣任务。
            五  针治的目的
    针治的目的在治病上分为三种，即制止、兴奋、诱导。
    （１）制止法（又名镇静法）。
    所谓制止法，就是因生活机能如肌肉、神经、分泌、血液等发生亢进，给以持久的强刺激，达到镇静、缓解、收缩、制止的目的。例如：由于知觉神经机能亢进，发生过敏，产生疼痛，又因为运动神经机能的兴奋、发生痉挛、搐搦，给它一种缓解作用。血管发生扩张，它可以调整使它收缩。为达此目的，可用一针或几针（针可以粗些）刺几个穴位，用捣术与多卧针，给以强的持久的刺激。
    （２）兴奋法
    与制止法完全相反，有些疾病是由于生活机能减弱，给以弱刺激或中等度的刺激，发生催进作用的方法。例如：知觉神经运动神经的钝麻、麻痹，给它调整。内脏神经麻痹，使它恢复常态。弱刺激可以煽动生活机能，中等刺激可以唤起生活机能旺盛。此法用针稍细，针法是轻度的捻转，不多卧针。给以弱的短促的刺激。
    （３）诱导法
    所说诱导法，是在距离患部较远的部位针刺，使那部分神经兴奋，血管扩张，来诱导患部的血液及病的产物来治好疾病。例如：对深部的炎症、充血、郁血，在表面或在远隔部位给以针刺。如对脑充血，在四肢末端给该部知觉神经刺激，发生反射作用，使管脑的血管收缩的神经，发挥它的机能，来驱逐脑的充血。此法的针法，捻卧反复进行。
    制止法，兴奋法，诱导法，也就是要达到制止作用、兴奋作用、诱导作用。刺针就分为直接刺激与间接刺激两种。给患部的神经肌肉直接刺激可达治疗目的；给皮肤和知觉神经的末端以浅的刺激，就是间接刺激（反射作用），也能达目的。但因反射作用所显的部位，比局部刺激可达广泛的范围，所以对某些疾病比直接刺激好。
            六  手法与“补泻”问题
    同一个穴位的神经，因刺激的轻重、久暂、捻动的方向，发生的作用就不相同。我们如何使刺激恰到好处，前面已经说过，要达镇静作用，就用强烈、持久的刺激；要达兴奋作用，就用轻微、短暂的刺激。这并没有把手法说完全，还有许多细微的地方要继续研究。古针灸书上，把这个问题，叫做“补泻迎随”，迎也就是泻的意思，随也就是补。他们非常重视“补虚泻实”：“不正之气、不跳之脉，需补。气旺之时，需泻。”说虚状要补，就相当于我们说的持久的重刺激。实状要泻，就相当于短暂的轻刺激。不过认为人体里面有一种“气”，认为“气”由“神”指挥（气为神之使），血由“气”指挥（行血者气、气为血之师），“神”是发生思想的东西，由思想引起动作，他们就认为是“神”使“气”到了肢体上，引起运动。这是古时不知道中枢神经，末梢神经，凭经验感觉空想出来的东西。他们认为针的不同作用，是由于泻了气、或补了气。凭经验又凭空想创造了各种补气、泻气的方法。凭经验摸索出来的，一般的有用，也好用科学道理解释；空想成份大的，一般没有什么作用。比如说泻的手法，“紧提慢按”“一进三退”，都说明刺激要轻，是对的。至于说捻转，每捻六下，停一会，是泻，因为“六”是“阴数”（过去把双数看成阴数，单数看成阳数）。又说，出针时，快些出针，把针眼摇大一点，不揉闭它，以便“邪气”泻出来，所谓“疾出针面，不闭其孔”，这就很难令人听信，实际上也不见有什么作用。
    补法上说要“提慢紧按”“三进一退”“向右攒剔，向左攒剔”，都是说的重刺激，可以说得通。至于要行“九九之数”（捻针每次九下）慢慢出针，针孔要小，所谓“渐出针面，疾闭其孔”，这虽说也对，但是“九九之数”就可“补”，“疾闭其孔”为的是不让“气”跑了等等，同样是很难令人听信。有些针灸家也经验到了，“补泻手数，不在久暂多寡，而在病情轻重”，以病的好转为定。
    至于转针的方向，古书上有的认为针身体左边，从右向左捻转，就是补，从左向右转就是泻；针右边则相反，所谓“补以顺转，泻以逆转”。有的又认为不必这样。这是由于左、右转，常常表现出不同的作用，但距离很近同一条线上的穴位，同一方向捻转，并不一定每次都有相同作用。因为针尖有时刺在神精的左侧，有时刺在右侧，同一方向的捻转，对神经的影响不能相同，所以想作死板规定，就不可能。
    那末，又怎么办呢？这主要靠不断地询问病人的感觉，观察疾病的变化。如多向左转，痉挛、疼痛就减轻，相反就沉重，那么就多向左转。刺激的具体程度也是这样来斟酌的。有的是要病人觉的舒适、轻快，就照这标准去试，看如何转、如何捣动病人最舒适，就如何去做。例如治某男性患者颜面神经痉挛，针痉挛侧的四白穴，向左转时，右眼与口角抽动得更厉害，向右转时，就停止抽动，于是向右转稍行针后，即卧针，经过二十分钟，又向右转退针，立刻痊愈。另外有一同样病的男性，针四白穴，向右转就更痉挛，向左转即停止，但圈子转得大时，也不能克服痉挛，只有向左极轻微的捻动才停止痉挛，直到退针都用轻微左转的方法，病也立即消失了。又有女性患者，是左侧颜面神经痉挛，表现的症状是左眼上下睑抽动，有时妨碍看东西，反复针刺眼圈周围的穴，针刺时可停止抽动，退针后又如常，以后针刺三阴交、地机等穴调理月经，颜面抽动就见好些。如需要病人在针刺的某部分酸困，就在酸困时出针（阅治疗篇中眼鼻耳疾病之衄血患者）。
    如果不能得到明显反应时又怎么办呢？刺激的轻重，可以由经验得来，捻转方向就以向左向右一般多，所谓“平补平泻”为宜。在注意手法的同时，还得注意所取的穴位，是否对该病有效。例如有一位老先生患胃病多年，在针灸治疗期间，停止疼痛，夜间不失眠，食欲与消化都很好，每日或隔一日针一次，取穴是在腰背部腹部四肢轮翻的针，前后共二十余日，根据记录，每次以针足三里、胃俞、膈俞等穴后，精神最好，尤以针后在胃俞、膈俞、中脘等穴用灸更好，以后就多给他针灸这些对他特别见效的穴位。
