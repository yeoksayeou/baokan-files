Korean Correspondence

　　The Third Blow
　　Collective writing by frontline reporters and correspondents of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    On December 30, 1950, the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced to the world: "The Korean People's Army units and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units continue to attack on all fronts and have driven the enemy out of the territory north of the 38th Parallel." The American invading forces and the Li Seung-man puppet army, which had suffered two heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people's armies on the Unsan battlefield and the banks of the Chongchon River, suddenly fantasized about using the "38th Parallel" as a defense line to save their disastrous fate in their moment of panic. So, while shouting "ceasefire and peace talks," they formed a defense line more than 400 li wide on the front and 140 li deep with eight tattered puppet army divisions and four American and British divisions.

    The enemy pinned all their hopes on holding the "38th Parallel." The American invaders and their puppet Li Seung-man once shouted at the time: "The 38th Parallel is the lifeline!" They ordered their mercenaries to "use their corpses as positions and coexist with the positions." However, under the hammer of the powerful third strike—the New Year Offensive—by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the 38th Parallel defense line, which the enemy regarded as their "lifeline," collapsed across the board in just a few hours.

            I. Marching Southward to the "38th Parallel"

    On New Year's Eve, countless Chinese and Korean people's counter-attacking armies marched rapidly towards the 38th Parallel, treading on solid ice and deep snow. Infantry, artillery, transport teams, and stretcher teams, a rolling stream of people crowded the large and small roads, and the crossings of various rivers became bustling markets. The rattling of car engines, the rumbling of artillery wheels, and the shouting of people and horses mixed day and night on the river surface and roads.

    This was a great historical march. On both sides of the Chongchon River, in every corner of this land, the soldiers had heard the cries of the suffering people, asking them to "continue to advance until the last enemy is eliminated." The soldiers cherished the heartfelt letters of comfort from the people of Northeast China in their pockets, wishing them "to win even greater victories! Bury the American invaders on the Korean Peninsula!" The soldiers understood that these words meant that they were required to avenge the dead and not allow the enemy to bring the disaster of Korea to any land in the motherland and the world. Filled with such fighting enthusiasm, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese and Korean People's Army braved the unprecedented wind and snow in Korea in recent years. After more than ten days of long-distance night marches, the vanguard approached the "38th Parallel."

            II. A Historic Battle

    At dusk on New Year's Eve, the attacking troops of the Chinese and Korean People's Army entered the more than one-hundred-li front-line position facing the enemy, and countless artillery pieces were ready for battle, and a fierce battle was about to begin.

    At five o'clock, countless green signal flares rose into the sky over the position - this was the signal for the liberation of the people of South Korea. Suddenly, a burst of red light brought a heaven-shaking and earth-splitting roar, and a swarm of shells stormed the enemy's artillery positions and flew towards the enemy's fortifications. The earth trembled in a chorus of explosions and the roar of shells leaving the artillery. After a few minutes, the enemy's artillery no longer made a sound. Then a red signal flare rose in the front, indicating that the infantry had already broken through the enemy's forward positions and requested extended shooting. The gunners quickly fired the shells to the enemy's depth, and in a moment, the red signal flares rose again in the distance.

    Countless sharp arrows, serving as frontal assaults, plunged straight into the enemy's positions under the cover of artillery fire. They crossed the Imjin River, Hantan River, Gukmangbong and other lines of natural barriers that the enemy had strongly fortified almost at the same time. The "Steel Company" of a certain volunteer army unit, which was famous for its tenacious fighting in previous battles, was one of the first companies to break through the Imjin River. The assault team bravely jumped into the cold current floating with ice floes, and they set up machine guns on the ice to shoot at the enemy. The "Anti-Tank Hero Platoon," which had won glorious titles on the Chongchon River front, was ordered to clear the bunker groups on the front and open up the way forward for the entire battalion. Jin Kezhi, the platoon leader of the hero platoon, a farmer from Hulin County, Songjiang Province, who has now become an excellent commander, led the commando team to the front of the bunker, and two rows of gable-shaped barbed wire blocked the way. The enemy in the bunker threw grenades outwards, and machine gun bullets flew from both sides like splashing water. He ordered the machine gun shooters to resolutely block the enemy's firepower. When the enemy's machine gun was just suppressed, fighter Wang Baolin grabbed a bazooka from someone else and ran forward. In this tense moment, he skillfully pressed the bazooka, and with a loud noise, a gap was blown in the barbed wire, and Jin Kezhi quickly led the fighters to rush up. At this time, the heroic blaster Wang Baolin sacrificed on the road of the assault; Gao Fenglai, a member of the Communist Party of China and a soldier, also fell in the brave charge! He refused the medic's rescue, and he took out one hundred Korean won from his pocket - that was the consolation money given to the volunteer army by the Korean people: "I can no longer work for the Party, this is the last Party membership fee."

    The warriors who were advancing were all ignited with the anger of revenge. Machine gun shooter Cui Tongsheng rushed to the first bunker, put the machine gun on the bunker cover and fired at the second bunker. Platoon leader Jin Kezhi and the fighters jumped into the traffic trench and fought a bunker-by-bunker battle. The enemy was frightened by this fierce attack and fled in panic. In just ten minutes, they cleared two rows of barbed wire and three bunkers. The follow-up troops passed through their breakthrough like a tide.

    The battle quickly developed into a hill-by-hill battle. A company of a certain volunteer army unit, after crossing the Hantan River at night, captured seventeen hills in seven hours from 9:00 pm to 4:00 am, and seized twelve recoilless guns, anti-aircraft guns and other weapons. This kind of battle is very difficult, requiring sparse formation and abundant physical strength. The warriors cleverly avoided the enemy's artillery fire, landmines, barbed wire, and layers of deer villages piled up with felled trees. They climbed step by step from steep cliffs, grabbing bushes and thorns and pine trees growing under the cliffs, and stepping on rocks. The first to climb tied the prepared rope to the tree so that the followers could climb the rope more quickly, and the warriors arrived at the top of the mountain one after another. The enemy could not imagine that anyone could pass through such steep cliffs and layers of defense, and when the muzzles of the warriors were already pointing at the enemy's heads, they were still shooting at the distant intersection.

    On this night, after the 38th Parallel, which was the first to bear the brunt, was first broken through, the Li Seung-man puppet army was beaten at every turn and fled in panic. At the same time, the American invading forces in the so-called second line of defense - the area of Munsan, Chuncheon, and Uijeongbu - and the American and British invading forces in the so-called third line of defense - the Han River line, also turned around and fled south. The enemy's so-called depth defense line thus disintegrated.

            III. Driving the American Invaders out of the Entirety of Korea

    When the New Year's Day sun dyed the peaks on the 38th Parallel red, the pursuit began.

    "Forward! Towards Seoul!" "Forward! Eliminate the last enemy!" The crowd of people all over the mountains and plains appeared on the land of southern Korea. The mountain was as steep as the ridge of a fish, and the road was so small that it could only accommodate one foot. The melted snow was frozen with a layer of thin ice. The biting cold wind blew through the soldiers' sweat-soaked cotton clothes. When they were hungry, they didn't have time to cook. Everyone opened their dry food bags, grabbed a handful of snow, ate a bite of dry food, and gnawed a bite of snow, while eating and advancing. Everyone who participated in this march will always remember: Every step was difficult, but every step was heading towards victory. They transformed the difficulties into hatred for American imperialism, and they felt the greatest pleasure in seeing the vast number of victims regain the light of day from the claws of the enslavers.

    On January 4, the vanguard troops liberated Seoul. Thousands of troops crossed the Han River and continued to pursue and annihilate the enemy.

　　第三次打击
　  随我国人民志愿军前线记者与通讯员集体写作
    一九五○年十二月三十日，朝鲜人民军总司令部公告世界：“朝鲜人民军部队与中国人民志愿军部队一道在各战线上继续进攻，并已将敌军驱逐出三八线以北的领土。”曾经在云山战场与清川江边受到中、朝人民军队两次沉重打击的美国侵略军和李承晚伪军，在惊魂甫定之际，忽然幻想以“三八线”作为挽救其惨败命运的防线。于是一面高喊“停火和谈”，一面以八个破烂不堪的伪军师团和四个美、英师组成了正面宽四百余里，纵深一百四十里的防御阵地。
    敌人把一切希望寄托在“三八线”的固守，美国侵略者及其傀儡李承晚曾在当时喊出：“三八线就是生命线！”命令其雇佣兵们“以尸体做阵地，与阵地共存亡。”但是在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军强大的第三次打击——新年攻势的锤击下，仅历数小时，敌军视为“生命线”的三八线防线即全线崩溃了。
            一、向“三八线”南进军
    新年前夕，无数支中朝人民反攻大军，踏着坚冰深雪向三八线疾进。步兵、炮兵、运输队、担架队，滚滚人流拥满了大小道路，各条河流的渡口变成闹市。汽车马达的轧轧声，炮车铁轮的隆隆声，人马的嘶嚷，连日彻夜地交杂在江面与道路上。
    这是历史的大进军，在清川江两岸，在这块土地上的每一个角落，战士们听过受难的人民的哭诉，要求他们“继续前进，直至消灭最后一个敌人。”战士们的口袋里珍贵地装着东北人民期望殷切的慰问信，预祝他们“再取得更大的胜利！把美国侵略军埋葬在朝鲜半岛上！”战士们懂得这些话，那就是要求他们为死难者复仇，要求他们不许敌人把朝鲜的灾难带到祖国与世界的任何一块土地上去。中、朝人民军指战员们充满着这样的战斗热情，冒着朝鲜数年来所未有过的大风雪，经十多天的长途夜奔，前锋迫近了“三八线”。
            二、一场历史的战斗
    除夕黄昏，中朝人民军的攻击部队进入了与敌对峙的百余里正面阵地，无数门大炮已严阵以待，一场激烈的战斗即将揭幕。
    五点，阵地上空升起无数颗绿色的信号弹——这是南朝鲜人民解放的信号。顿时，一片闪动着红光带来一阵天崩地裂似的轰响，成群的炮弹风暴似地直压敌炮阵地，飞向敌人工事，土地在响成一片的爆炸声和炮弹出口的轰鸣中颤动了。几分钟后，敌人的大炮不再作声了。接着前方升起了红色的信号弹，这标志着步兵早已突破敌人前沿阵地，要求延伸射击。炮手们赶紧把炮弹向敌纵深射去，片刻，红色的信号弹又已在远处升起。
    担任正面突击的无数个锐利的箭头，在炮火的掩护下直插敌阵。他们几乎在同一个时间越过了临津江、汉滩川、国望峰等一线曾经为敌强固设防的天然屏障。在历次战役中以战斗顽强闻名的志愿军某部“钢铁连”，是最先突破临津江的连队之一，突击队员们奋勇跃入了飘浮着冰块的寒流，他们把机枪架在冰上向敌人射击。在清川江战线上获得光荣称号的“反坦克英雄排”奉命肃清正面的地堡群，给全营打开前进道路。一位松江省虎林县的农民，而现在已成为出色的指挥员的英雄排排长金克志，带着尖刀班已进到地堡前沿，两道屋脊形铁丝网挡住了去路。地堡里的敌人向外丢着手榴弹，机枪子弹泼水似地从两侧飞来。他命令机枪射手坚决封锁住敌人火力。当敌人的机枪刚刚被压住，战士王保林从别人手里抢过爆破筒就向前跑去。在这紧张的一瞬间，他以巧妙的动作按好了爆破筒，一声巨响，铁丝网炸开了一个缺口，金克志迅速率领战士冲了上去。这时，英雄的爆破手王保林在冲锋道路上牺牲了；中国共产党党员、战士高凤来也在勇猛直冲中倒下了！他拒绝了卫生员对他的救护，他从袋里掏出一百元朝鲜币——那是朝鲜人民送给志愿军的慰问金：“我不能再为党工作了，这是最后的一次党费。”
    正在前进中的勇士们个个燃起了复仇的怒火。机枪射手崔同生冲上第一个地堡，就把机枪架在地堡盖上向第二个地堡猛射，排长金克志与战士们纷纷跳下交通沟进行逐堡争夺战，敌人给这一猛袭吓得狼狈而逃。前后十分钟，他们肃清了两道铁丝网，三个地堡。后续部队潮涌一般通过了他们的突破口。
    战斗很快发展成为逐山争夺战。志愿军某部一个连队在夜渡汉滩川后，从晚上九点钟打到清晨四时，七小时内攻下十七个山头，缴获无后座力炮、机关炮等十二门。这种战斗是十分艰巨的，需要疏散的队形以及充沛的体力。勇士们机智地避开敌人的炮击、地雷、铁丝网与用砍倒的大树堆起来的层层鹿砦，他们从陡削的悬崖峭壁上，抓着灌木荆棘和山崖下长出的松树，蹬着岩石逐步攀登。先登上者把预先准备好的绳子拴在树上，使后续者能更迅速地缘绳攀登，勇士们源源到达了山顶。敌人无法想像有人能通过这样陡峭的山崖和层层防御冲上来的，当勇士们的枪口已经指向敌人的脑袋时，他们却还在朝着远方的路口射击。
    就在这一夜，首当其冲的三八线最先被突破后，李承晚伪军节节挨打，望风溃逃。与此同时，远在所谓第二道防线——汶山、春川、议政府一带的美国侵略军，以及什么第三道防线——汉江一线的美、英侵略军，也转身向南逃命。敌人的所谓纵深防线，就这样土崩瓦解了。
            三、把美国侵略者赶出全朝鲜
    当元旦的朝阳染红了三八线上的群峰时，追击开始了。
    “前进！向着汉城！”“前进！消灭最后一个敌人！”漫山遍野的人流涌现在朝鲜南部的土地上了。山陡得像鱼脊背，路小得只能放一只脚，融化了的积雪上面又冻了一层薄冰。凛冽的寒风，吹透了战士们汗湿的棉衣。肚子饿了，来不及做饭，大家解开干粮袋，又顺手抓起一捧雪，吃一口干粮，啃一口雪，一边吃一边前进。每一个参加在这个进军行列里的人们会永远记住：每一步的足迹都是艰苦的，但是每一步的足迹都在走向胜利，他们把困难化成对美帝国主义的仇恨，他们见到广大受难者从奴役者兽爪下重见天日而感到最大的愉快。
    一月四日，前锋部队光复汉城。千军万马渡过汉江，继续追歼敌人。
                                                （新华社十日讯）
