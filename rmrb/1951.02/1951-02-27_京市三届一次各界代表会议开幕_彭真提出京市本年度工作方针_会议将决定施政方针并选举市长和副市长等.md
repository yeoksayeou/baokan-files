【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】The Beijing Third Session of the First People's Representatives Conference opened at 2:00 PM on the 26th. 487 representatives attended the meeting, and guests included Luo Longji, a member of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and four others.

Vice Mayor Wu Han first reported on the election work of the representatives to the Third Session of the Beijing People's Representatives Conference. The report pointed out that the total number of representatives to this session is 519, of which 431 representatives were elected directly or indirectly, accounting for approximately 83% of the total number of representatives. This is a step forward compared to the first and second sessions of the People's Representatives Conference in terms of enriching the democratic form and content.

After Vice Mayor Wu's report, the meeting approved the list of the Presidium of the Conference and the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-Generals, as well as the agenda of the conference. The executive chairmen of yesterday's meeting were: Gu Qizong, Wu Han, Li Guorui, Liang Sicheng, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Shu Sheyu, Peng Zhen, Fu Huating, and nine others (in order of the number of strokes in their surnames).

Chairman Peng Zhen of the Presidium delivered the opening speech, which was warmly welcomed by the representatives. Chairman Peng Zhen first explained that the tasks of this session of the People's Representatives Conference are to listen to the work report of the Municipal People's Government; to decide on the policy guidelines for this year; and to elect the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and members of the Municipal People's Government for this session. Then, he put forward the work guidelines for Beijing for this year for discussion by the conference.

Among them, in the political aspect, it is necessary to continue to popularize and deepen the anti-American and aid-Korea anti-imperialist movement; to further eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces such as imperialists, secret agents, and feudal despots; to further advance democratic construction, and elect the People's Governments of the suburban districts and village People's Governments. In the economic aspect, further reorganize industry, face the countryside, strengthen urban-rural trade, and improve agricultural production. In cultural and educational work, it is necessary to improve primary and secondary school education, develop spare-time schools and literacy classes, and develop spare-time technical education, while paying attention to the health care of workers and students. In municipal construction, carry out the construction and maintenance of roads and sewers, and expand the water supply area and epidemic prevention work under the principle of spending less money and doing more things. In addition, it is also necessary to use various methods to solve the housing problems of citizens, strive to build 15,000 to 20,000 houses, and continue to add clinics by combining public and private efforts.

Subsequently, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the work of the Beijing Municipal People's Government in 1950. Vice Mayor Zhang's report included five aspects: political power construction and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, culture, education and health, municipal construction, and preferential treatment and relief for the unemployed. After briefly describing the progress of the above tasks, he pointed out that the work plan for 1950 that we proposed has been completed, and in many respects, it has been exceeded. This is the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; and it is also the result of the unity and joint efforts of the broad masses of the people and us. The experience of Beijing's construction over the past year has once again proved the superiority of the people's democratic system. The people's democratic system is a system that truly conforms to the interests of the people and has a high degree of administrative efficiency. However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in our work. For this reason, we focused on inspecting our work and conducting a comprehensive rectification campaign last year. The experience of the rectification campaign proves that in our revolutionary ranks, criticism and self-criticism are the best weapons to promote our progress. The rectification campaign, which combines regular work with summarizing work, should become a working system for us.

Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, made a report to the conference on the "Final Accounts of Beijing's Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure for 1950." He said: The implementation of the city's fiscal revenue and expenditure budget for 1950 was good and achieved results. We not only realized the guidelines proposed and adopted at the Second Session of the Second Municipal People's Representatives Conference, and ensured the completion of the work plan for 1950, but also achieved a surplus. However, there are also shortcomings, mainly that the budget and final accounting system is not sound enough, and the audit system is not strict enough, so there have been shortcomings such as the misappropriation of individual items and the withdrawal of funds without budget approval, which should be reviewed and corrected.

Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Beijing in the two years since liberation. He cited facts to show that as a result of the unremitting and sharp struggle against counter-revolutionaries in the past two years, counter-revolutionaries have been severely hit, and the revolutionary order in Beijing has been stabilized. However, Beijing is the capital of the Chinese people, and therefore has become the main target for various conspiracies and sabotage by enemies at home and abroad. Since the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea last year, many bandits and secret agents have actually believed that "the time has come" and vainly attempted to "make a comeback," intensifying their counter-revolutionary activities. Therefore, in order to consolidate the revolutionary order of the capital, it is necessary to severely punish the unrepentant counter-revolutionaries and those who continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries promulgated by the Central People's Government. It is hoped that the people's representatives from all walks of life and the people of the city will fully support the People's Government and complete this arduous and important task.

Yesterday's meeting approved the list of the Government Work Report Review Committee, the list of the Proposal Review Committee, the election method of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee, and the list of 14 election supervisors. The meeting also discussed the number of members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee, and finally approved that the Presidium of the Conference and the delegations should jointly negotiate and decide on the list of candidates for the members of the consultation committee.

Today, the conference is adjourned for group discussions.

　　京市三届一次各界代表会议开幕
　　彭真提出京市本年度工作方针
　　会议将决定施政方针并选举市长和副市长等
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议在二十六日下午二时开幕，出席代表四百八十七人，来宾有中央人民政府政务院政务委员罗隆基等五人。
    首由吴晗副市长报告北京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表的选举工作。报告指出：本届会议代表总数为五百十九名，其中由直接选举和间接选举产生的代表有四百三十一名，约占代表总数的百分之八十三。这比第一、第二两届代表会议，在民主形式和内容的充实方面又向前迈进了一步。
    吴副市长报告后，会议通过大会主席团及正、副秘书长名单和大会议事日程。昨日会议执行主席为：古奇踪、吴晗、李国瑞、梁思成、张奚若、许德珩、舒舍予、彭真、傅华亭等九人（依姓氏笔划为序）。
    大会主席团彭真主席致开幕词，受到代表们热烈的欢迎。彭真主席首先说明：本届代表会议的任务是听取市人民政府工作的报告；决定本年度的施政方针；选举本届的市长、副市长和市人民政府委员。接着，他提出北京市本年度的工作方针，供大会讨论。
    其中，在政治方面要继续普及和深入抗美援朝的反帝运动；进一步肃清帝国主义、特务和封建恶霸等反革命残余；把民主建政再推进一步，选举城郊各区的区人民政府和村人民政府。在经济方面进一步改组工业，面向农村，加强城乡贸易，提高农业生产。在文教工作上要提高中小学教育，开展业余学校和识字班，并发展业余技术教育，同时注意工人和学生的保健工作。在市政建设上，在少用钱多办事的原则下进行修建和保养道路、下水道，并扩大自来水供水区域及防疫等工作。此外，还要用各种方法解决市民住房问题，为建筑一万五千间至两万间房屋而斗争，并采用公私合力的方法，继续增设诊疗所。
    继由张友渔副市长报告北京市人民政府一九五○年度的工作，张副市长的报告包括政权建设和镇压反革命、恢复与发展工农业生产、文教卫生、市政建设以及优抚与救济失业等五个方面。他简要地叙述了上面各项工作进行的情况之后，指出：我们所提出的一九五○年度工作计划是完成了，并且，在许多方面还超过了。这是毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党北京市委员会对我们正确领导的结果；也是广大人民和我们团结一致，共同奋斗的结果。一年来，北京市建设的经验，再度证明了人民民主制度的优越。人民民主制度是真正符合于人民利益，具有高度行政效率的制度。但是另一方面，在我们的工作当中，也还存在着许多缺点。为此，我们在去年曾有重点地检查了工作和进行全面整风。整风的经验证明，在我们革命的队伍中，批评和自我批评是推动我们前进的最好武器。定期的和总结工作结合起来的整风，应当成为我们的一种工作制度。
    市财经委员会程宏毅副主任向大会作“关于一九五○年度北京市财政收支决算的报告”，他说：一九五○年度本市财政收支预算执行的情况是良好的，是有成绩的。我们不仅实现了在第二届第二次市各界人民代表会议上所提出与通过的方针，保证了一九五○年度工作计划的完成，并且，还做到了有结余。但是缺点也是有的，主要是预、决算制度不够健全，审计制度也还不够严格，因而曾发生个别科目流用和预算未经批准即动支款项等缺点，这是应该检讨与纠正的。
    北京市人民政府公安局冯基平副局长报告北京市解放两年来镇压反革命的工作。他列举事实说明：由于两年来同反革命分子进行不懈怠的尖锐斗争的结果，已经给予反革命分子以严重的打击，安定了北京的革命秩序。但是，北京是中国人民的首都，因此成为国内外敌人进行各种阴谋破坏的主要目标。去年美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，不少匪特分子竟认为“时机已至”，妄图“卷土重来”，变本加厉地进行反革命活动。因此，为了巩固首都的革命秩序，必须按照中央人民政府发布的惩治反革命条例，对怙恶不悛的反革命分子，及在解放后仍然继续进行反革命活动的分子加以严厉的制裁。希望各界人民代表和全市人民全力支持人民政府，完成这项艰巨重大的任务。
    昨日会议通过了政府工作报告审查委员会名单、提案审查委员会名单、北京市人民政府委员会选举办法和十四位选举监票人的名单。会议并讨论了北京市人民政府委员会委员名额问题，最后通过连同协商委员会委员候选名单一并授权大会主席团与各代表团共同协商决定。
    今日大会休会，进行分组讨论。
