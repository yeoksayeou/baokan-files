　　The Caijiagou District Village Cooperative in Fuyu County
　　Should Strengthen the Supervisory Role of Members
    In Caijiagou District, Fuyu County, Jilin Province, some village cooperative cadres privately use cooperative funds for personal business and profit, lacking the spirit of serving the members. Cui Yongjiu, the director of the Progressive Village Cooperative, and the village chief privately used 8 million yuan of cooperative funds to open a sugar workshop. Wang Mengzhou, the director of the Victory Village Cooperative, took advantage of his position to seek personal gain. When he learned that the state could not purchase a large amount of grain, he quickly sold his and other cadres' surplus grain to the state first. Some village cooperatives have become the village cadres' banks, and they can borrow cooperative funds at will. One village borrowed more than 7 million yuan from the cooperative for wartime service, which was not repaid for more than a month, affecting the cooperative's capital turnover.
    The reason for these shortcomings is the failure to implement effective supervision of the cooperative by the members. The cooperative rarely convenes members' meetings to report work to the members; at the same time, the district leaders also lack in-depth inspection of the cooperative. After discovering these shortcomings, the district cooperative has begun to pay attention to correcting them.

### 扶馀县蔡家沟区村合作社应加强社员群众监督作用

　　扶馀县蔡家沟区村合作社
　　应加强社员群众监督作用
    吉林省扶馀县蔡家沟区有些村合作社干部私自动用社款，个人经商谋利，缺乏为社员群众服务的精神。进步村合作社主任崔永久和村长私自动用合作社资金八百万元开糖坊。胜利村合作社主任王孟周利用工作方便，图谋个人利益。当他得知国家不能大量收购粮食的消息后，就赶紧把自己和其他干部的余粮抢先卖给国家。有些村的合作社成了村干部的银行，他们可以随便借用社款。某村因出战勤，借去合作社资金七百多万元，拖欠了一个多月也没还清，影响了该社资金的周转。
    产生这些缺点的原因，是由于未能实行社员群众对合作社有效的监督，合作社很少召开社员大会，向社员报告工作；同时区的领导上对合作社也缺乏深入的检查。区合作社在发现这些缺点后，已开始注意纠正。
