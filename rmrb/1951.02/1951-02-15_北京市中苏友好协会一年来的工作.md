The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established in October 1949. As Comrade Peng Zhen said at the inaugural meeting: "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has an incomparably profound material and spiritual foundation. The interests of the two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the people of the two countries, and the spirit of 'serving the working people' and 'striving for the greatest interests of the greatest number of people' are completely consistent. Friendship built on this foundation is solid and unshakable." Therefore, after the establishment of the Friendship Association, grassroots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association were quickly established in factories, enterprises, mines, government agencies, schools, streets, and some villages in Beijing, and the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was vigorously launched.

In the past year, the number of Friendship Association members has grown to 207,225. Among them, 60,785 are workers, accounting for 29.4 percent; 43,140 are students, accounting for 20.8 percent; 41,877 are staff members, accounting for 20.2 percent; 21,752 are farmers, accounting for 10.5 percent; 13,587 are military police, accounting for 6.6 percent; 8,546 are industrial and commercial figures, accounting for 4.1 percent; 8,142 are teachers, accounting for 3.9 percent; and 9,396 are others, accounting for 4.5 percent. The number and composition of people participating in the Friendship Association is so broad that it has made the Friendship Association the largest mass organization in Beijing.

In order to carry out widespread and regular propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship, we produced and distributed membership cards, formed eighty-eight schools into nineteen service stations, gradually established service stations in factories, government agencies, and districts, and trained a group of amateur cadres to carry out the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, branch associations, and sub-branches.

Since 1950, we have taken propaganda services as the daily basic work of the Friendship Association, focusing our manpower and material resources mainly on this aspect, and gradually developing film screenings, Russian radio broadcasts, photo exhibitions, publications, lectures, and library reading activities.

(1) Film Screenings: In January 1950, the Association organized two film projection teams to screen Soviet films in factories, suburbs, schools, government agencies, troops, the Labor People's Cultural Palace, and various districts in the city in a planned and mobile manner. Sometimes, in coordination with central tasks (such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea), relevant films were shown. Over the past year, a total of 732 films have been screened, with an audience of 1,121,020 people.

(2) Photo Exhibitions: Starting in March 1950, we began translating, editing, and beautifying the photos donated by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. A large-scale exhibition was held at the Labor People's Cultural Palace on May 1st, and these photos were broken down into smaller units and exhibited in various units in a mobile manner. In order to solve the serious shortage of photos, we organized the picture newspaper clipping exhibition work of the sub-branches, distributing 600 copies of each issue of Soviet pictorials to the sub-branches, and mobilizing members at all levels of the sub-branches to carry out clipping, copying, and exhibition work. Since September, the Association has added photography and photo reproduction work. In the past four months, 1,061 photos have been taken and produced. In total, the Association has held 337 large-scale and mobile exhibitions in the past eight months, with an audience of more than 458,000 people.

(3) Lectures: In March 1950, the Friendship Association hosted or co-hosted 88 lectures with the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, with scholars, professors, and experts from China and the Soviet Union giving special reports. The cumulative number of listeners was more than 81,500. Some sub-branch cadres relayed the lectures to their own units after listening to them, or used wall newspapers to publish summaries to expand publicity.

(4) Translation and Publication: Since April, in the past eight months, in addition to translating Soviet photos, we have also translated, compiled, and drawn the following books and periodicals: The published ones include "Chronicle of Sino-Soviet Events," "Collection of Lectures on Soviet Introduction" Volume 1 and Volume 2, "Citizens of the Soviet State" (selection of one-act plays), "A Year of Unprecedented Development of Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Broadcast Russian Lectures" elementary and intermediate textbooks, and other 18 kinds of series, as well as "Beijing Friendship Association" newspaper 8 issues, "Soviet Information" 3 issues. The translated and compiled but not yet published ones include "Modern Chinese History" Volume 2 (written by Yefimov) and other 6 kinds.

(5) Broadcast Russian Lectures: In order to meet the needs of the masses to learn Russian in order to learn from the Soviet Union and enhance Sino-Soviet friendship, the Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station have jointly run broadcast Russian lectures since December 1949. Initially, more than 12,000 people participated in the study, and people as far away as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Jingu, and Baoding listened to and studied. By the end of the first phase, only 2,400 people in the city had persisted in completing the study. This is a great achievement. More than 4,800 students have now registered for the second phase of Russian lectures.

(6) Library Reading: With the help of the Bureau of Culture and Education, the Association established 16 Friendship Association reading rooms in July last year, with one distributed in each district inside and outside the city. Each reading room has 500 books and periodicals. Since September, the Association has also launched mobile libraries to provide lending services to sub-branches. Many Friendship Associations have also established small reading rooms, allocating funds from membership fees to purchase books and issuing relevant books and periodicals on a long-term basis.

(7) Mass Rallies: Mass rallies play a great educational role in enhancing the internationalist spirit of the masses and enhancing Sino-Soviet friendship. The larger ones include the following four: 1. Welcoming and seeing off the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation. 2. Celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin. 3. Celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. 4. Celebrating the October Revolution Day.

In addition to the above work, with the help of the cinema and publishing industries, each member enjoys preferential discounts on purchasing books and watching movies with their membership card. In order to enhance the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, we have helped, translated, and conveyed correspondence between the people of the two countries.

In addition, in the movement to defend world peace and resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the Friendship Association, together with the people's organizations and the municipal government of Beijing, jointly launched and organized the peace signature campaign. The Friendship Association specifically proposed to carry out publicity work among the vast unorganized masses, and the general branches in each district led the peace signatures of the citizens in each district. In mid-May, the signature campaign began to be active in urban and suburban areas. Throughout the entire campaign, the Friendship Association's sub-branches at all levels generally played an active role in promoting the campaign. In particular, the general branch in the Second District not only went deep into the streets and alleys of the district to widely publicize and mobilize signatures, but also went to Longevity Hill outside the city, various parks in the city, and various districts to mobilize the masses to sign. Female heroes who defended world peace, such as Ren Shuhua, Gao Yuquan, and Zhang Yangshi, emerged. These female heroes are all ordinary housewives, some illiterate, some with very little literacy. After joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, their awareness increased, and they were enthusiastic about the affairs of the country and the masses, so they were able to have extraordinary courage to go to the public to carry out publicity work. By the end of the signature work in early September, the number of signatures in the city exceeded 1.8 million, accounting for 90 percent of the city's population.

After U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, in order to enable the vast number of members to understand the current situation and the tasks of the people of the whole country, the Friendship Association held six large current affairs report meetings, which enhanced the patriotism and internationalism of the vast number of members in the movement and promoted the work of the Friendship Association's sub-branches.

In the past year, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has done the above work, which is of great significance for consolidating and developing Sino-Soviet friendly relations. We believe that in 1951, with the close concern and love of the people of the whole city, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will achieve closer ties and cooperation with various people's organizations, making the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union more solid and developed.

　　北京市中苏友好协会一年来的工作
　　曾平
    北京市中苏友协成立于一九四九年十月。正如彭真同志在成立大会上所说的：“中苏两国人民的友谊是有着无比深厚的物质基础和精神基础的。中苏两个国家和两国人民的利害及‘为劳动人民服务’、‘为最大多数人民的最大利益而奋斗’的精神是完全一致的，建筑在这种基础上的友谊，是巩固而不可动摇的。”因此在友协成立之后，北京市各工厂、企业、矿山、机关、学校、街道及部分乡村很快就建立了中苏友好协会的基层组织，中苏友好协会的工作便蓬勃地展开了。
    在过去一年中，友协会员发展到二○七、二二五人。其中工人六○、七八五人，占百分之二十九·四；学生四三、一四○人，占百分之二○·八；职员四一、八七七人，占百分之二○·二；农民二一、七五二人，占百分之十·五；军警一三、五八七人，占百分之六·六；工商界八、五四六人，占百分之四·一；教员八、一四二人，占百分之三·九；其他九、三九六人，占百分之四·五。参加友协的人数和成分是这样广泛，使友协成为北京市最大的群众团体。
    为了普遍而经常的进行中苏友好的宣传教育，我们制发了会员证，把八十八个学校组成了十九个服务站，在工厂、机关和各区也逐步建立了服务站，并培养了一批业余干部，来进行中苏友好协会、分会、支会的工作。
    从一九五○年起，我们以宣传服务为友协的日常基本工作，把人力物力主要放在这方面，逐步开展了电影、俄文广播、图片、出版、讲座、图书阅览等工作。
    （一）放映电影：一九五○年一月本会组织了两个电影放映队，在工厂、郊区、学校、机关、部队、劳动人民文化宫及城内各区有计划的流动放映苏联影片，有时配合中心工作（如抗美援朝）放映有关的影片，一年来共计放映了七三二场电影，观众达一、一二一、○二○人。
    （二）图片展览：一九五○年三月开始，我们将苏联对外文化协会赠送的照片，着手进行翻译编辑，粘贴美化等工作，五一节在劳动人民文化宫举办了一次大型展览，并将这些图片化整为零流动到各单位去展览。为了解决图片的严重缺乏现象，我们组织支会的画报剪贴展览工作，把每期苏联画报分发支会六百册，由各级支会发动会员来进行剪贴、缮写和展览工作。九月份起本会又增添了摄影和翻洗图片的工作，四个月来已摄制了照片一、○六一张。总计八个月来本会共举办了大型展览和流动展览三三七次，观众达四十五万八千余人。
    （三）讲演会：一九五○年三月，友协主办或与苏联对外文化协会等合办，举行了八十八次讲演会，由中苏两国的学者、教授、专家作专题报告。听众人数累计八万一千五百余人。一些支会干部在听讲后并在本单位进行传达，或利用壁报公布摘要，以扩大宣传。
    （四）翻译和出版：从四月份开始，八个月来除翻译苏联图片之外，还翻译、编写、绘制了下列书刊：已出版的有《中苏大事日志》、《苏联介绍演讲集》第一辑和第二辑、《苏维埃国家公民》（独幕剧选）、《中苏友好空前发展的一年》、《广播俄语讲座》初级和中级教材等十八种丛书，及《北京友协》报八期、《苏联资料》三期。已译编尚未出版的有《中国近代史》下卷（叶菲莫夫著）等六种。
    （五）广播俄语讲座：为了满足群众学习俄语以便学习苏联，增进中苏友谊的要求，友协与北京市人民广播电台自一九四九年十二月合办广播俄语讲座。最初参加学习的有一万二千余人，远达石家庄、唐山、津沽、保定等地都有人收听学习。直到第一期结束时，仅本市仍有二千四百人坚持学完。这是很大的成绩。第二期俄语讲座现已登记的学员有四千八百多人。
    （六）图书阅览：本会于去年七月起在文教局帮助下，设立了十六个友协阅览室，城内外每区都分布一个。每一个阅览室有五百本书刊。九月份起本会又举办了流动图书，供给支会借阅。不少友协也建立了小型的阅览室，由本会从会费中拨款购书，并长期发给有关书刊。
    （七）群众性的集会：群众性集会在提高群众国际主义精神和增进中苏友好方面，都有很大的教育作用。其中较大的有以下四次：一、欢迎与欢送苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团。二、庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰。三、庆祝中苏新约签定。四、庆祝十月革命节。
    除了上述工作外，友协在影院业和出版业的帮助下，使每个会员得到凭本人会员证享受购书和看电影的优待折扣。为了增进中苏两国人民之间的友谊，我们帮助、翻译和传达了两国人民之间的通信。
    此外在保卫世界和平与抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，友协曾联合北京市的各人民团体和市政府共同发动和组织和平签名运动，友协特别提出了向广大的无组织群众进行宣传工作，并由各区总支会领导各区市民的和平签名。五月中签名运动开始在城市和郊区活跃起来，在整个运动过程中，友协的各级支会一般的都起了积极的推动作用，特别是第二区的总支会不但深入本区的各个街道胡同广泛宣传动员签名，而且还到城外万寿山，城内各公园，各区去动员群众签名。涌现出像任淑华、高玉权、张杨氏等保卫世界和平的女英雄。这些女英雄都是普通的家庭妇女，有的不识字，有的识很少的字，参加了中苏友协以后，觉悟提高，热心关切国家和群众的事情，所以能有非凡的勇气跑到大庭广众中去进行宣传工作。到九月初结束签名工作，本市签名人数超过一百八十万人，占全市人口百分之九十。
    在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争后，友协为了使广大会员认识当前形势和全国人民的任务，前后举办了六次大的时事报告会，使广大会员在运动中提高了爱国主义和国际主义的精神，推动了友协支会的工作。
    过去一年来，北京市中苏友好协会做了上述的工作，这些工作对于巩固和发展中苏友好关系是有极大意义的。我们相信，一九五一年在全市人民的密切关心、爱护下，京市中苏友协将与各人民团体取得更密切的连系与配合，使中苏两国人民的友好合作更加巩固与发展。
