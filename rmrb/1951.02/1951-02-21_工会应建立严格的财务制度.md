　　Trade Unions Should Establish Strict Financial Systems
    To the Editor:
    In the course of auditing trade union membership dues and funds, we have discovered serious chaos in the financial affairs of many factory and industry trade unions. I am providing two examples, hoping you will publish them to draw attention to this issue:
    (1) The Third District Youth Printing Factory Trade Union in Beijing has not established a strict system for the safekeeping and use of union membership dues, cultural and educational funds, and labor insurance funds. They deposited the money with the administrative accountant, and any trade union committee member could get money by writing a note and stamping it with the trade union seal (which was not managed by a designated person). The monthly income and expenditure of membership dues were neither budgeted nor finalized according to the regulations of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, nor were they reported to the workers, so errors often occurred in the use of membership dues and funds, and even corruption occurred. For example, because there was no set method for using the labor insurance fund, workers could borrow it at will, borrowing a total of 3 million yuan. Once, a trade union committee member even took 1.22 million yuan from the labor insurance fund to buy waist drums. Min Cunpu, a cultural and educational committee member, squandered money and embezzled more than 400,000 yuan, and most workers demanded that he be sent to court.
    (2) Zhao Baoxiang, the organization committee member of the Third Branch of the Beijing Construction Industry Trade Union, was in charge of membership dues. Sometimes he did not issue receipts for collecting membership dues; several receipts for paying membership dues to the higher-level trade union were also lost; income and expenditure were not clearly accounted for, and it was impossible to report to the masses. The audit revealed a difference of 2.67 million yuan between income and expenditure, of which Zhao Baoxiang himself embezzled more than 1.6 million yuan, and he arbitrarily lent more than 950,000 yuan to members. Now the Third District Office has urged Zhao to repay more than 2.1 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan still outstanding, and is urging him to continue repayment.

    Editor's Note: The financial chaos in some factory trade unions in the Third District of Beijing is mainly due to trade union cadres not paying attention to financial work, and the trade unions not establishing strict financial systems internally. Therefore, higher-level trade unions should supervise these trade unions to immediately conduct financial audits and inspections, educate trade union cadres to pay attention to financial work, and thereby establish strict financial systems.

### 工会应建立严格的财务制度

　　工会应建立严格的财务制度
    编辑同志：
    我们在清理工会会费和工会经费工作中，发现不少工厂、行业的工会在财务工作上存在严重的混乱现象。现在举出两个例子，希望你们发表，以引起大家对这个问题的重视：
    （一）北京市三区青年印刷厂工会对工会会费、文教费和劳保金的保管和使用，没有建立严格的制度。他们把钱存在行政会计那里，任何工会委员开个条，盖上工会的章（这章也没专人掌管），就可领钱。每月会费收支情况既不按市总工会的规定造预算、决算，也不向工人群众报告，所以会费和经费的使用常闹错误，甚至发生贪污现象。如劳保金，因为没有一定的使用办法，工人可以随便借用。总共借出三百余万元。有一次，工会委员竟从劳保金中取出一百二十二万去买腰鼓。文教委员闵存朴胡吃乱花，连续贪污四十多万，多数工人都要求把他送法院。
    （二）京市建筑业工会三分会，会费由组织委员赵宝祥经管。他收会费有时不开收据；向上级工会缴纳会费的单据，也丢了好几张；收入支出都没有清楚的账目，无法向群众报告。清理结果，发现收支差额达二百六十七万，其中赵宝祥本人贪污了一百六十多万，由他经手随便借给会员九十五万多。现在三区办事处已督促赵偿还二百一十几万，尚欠五十万，正督促他继续偿还。
                                  北京市总工会三区办事处一干部
    编者按：北京三区某些工厂工会存在财务混乱现象，主要是由于工会干部不重视财务工作，工会内部没有建立严格的财务制度。因此，上级工会应监督这些工会立即进行财务清理检查，教育工会干部重视财务工作，从而建立严格的财务制度。
