Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 16th: The first Miao autonomous government in Guizhou Province – the Miao Autonomous Region People’s Government of Kaili District, Lushan County – was formally established on January 28th. On January 25th, the autonomous region convened a people's representative conference composed mainly of Miao people and representatives of various ethnic groups to listen to and discuss the work report of the district people's government and its future work tasks. Over the past year, through suppressing bandits and special agents, and carrying out grain requisition work, the masses have gained preliminary awareness and organization, and many activists and cadres who are supported and loved by the masses have emerged. This conference acted on behalf of the people's congress, elected Gu Huaian (Miao nationality) as the head of the autonomous region people's government, and a total of thirteen members, including nine Miao people.

During the meeting, representatives of various ethnic groups from neighboring counties and districts of the autonomous region were sent to the meeting to offer their congratulations. At the celebration meeting held in the district, people from various townships performed various songs and dances.

The Miao Autonomous Region People's Government of Kaili District was established with the direct help and guidance of the Third Branch of the Central People's Government's Southwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation. The district has a population of over 40,000, with the Miao people accounting for 88% of the total population of the district.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th: Thanks to the correct implementation of ethnic policies by the People's Government, the lives of the Yi and Han people living in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains on the border of Sichuan and Kang have gradually improved, and the relationship between the two ethnic groups has become increasingly harmonious.

Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government's Great Han chauvinists, the Yi and Han people living in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains lived a very hard life, and it was difficult to exchange goods. The estrangement between the two ethnic groups was extremely deep, and the Yi people did not dare to go down the mountains freely. Since October last year, the local People's Government has vigorously carried out trade work. The Leshan Special District Department Store supplied the local people with 120,000 jin of edible oil, 190,000 jin of salt, and 4 million chi of native cloth. The local products company also purchased 75,000 jin of gallnuts, 90,000 jin of tung oil, 39,000 jin of cattle and sheep skins, as well as dried fruits and herbs. As a result of the large-scale exchange of goods and developed transactions, Ebian County has changed the market day from every three days to every two days since October last year. In Pingshan County, there were less than 100 merchants in July last year, but by October, it had increased to 250. In order to solve the problem of food shortages for the Yi people, the South Sichuan People's Administrative Office lent them 130,000 jin of grain. Maban and Ebian counties have convened Yi representatives' conferences, and six Yi representatives attended the first South Sichuan People's Representative Conference.

Under the influence of the correct ethnic policies of the People's Government, the Yi people in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains have eliminated their previous concerns about not daring to go down the mountains. They organized visiting groups twice in August and December last year to visit factories and schools in Chongqing, Leshan, Zigong, and Luxian. The representatives of the visiting group, Afen Shuangxi and Gan Eryi, gratefully said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we were bullied and killed. Now we can live equally with the people of all ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland. This is the result of Chairman Mao leading the people of all ethnic groups to make revolution and destroy the reactionary government." Mu Gan'er, the leader of the Hazidianmugen'er branch of the Yi ethnic group in Ebian County, was misled by the deceptive propaganda of the Kuomintang remnants. After the liberation of the county, he led more than 300 Yi compatriots from the entire branch to flee to the Lesser Liang Mountains. They spent six months in the deep mountains in a painful life lacking oil, salt, and cloth. Finally, under the correct ethnic policies of the People's Government, they were persuaded to return to Ebian County and live a life of peace and contentment.

　　贵州省炉山县凯里区成立苗族人民自治区政府        
    大小凉山区彝汉人民日趋和睦
    【新华社贵阳十六日电】贵州省第一个苗族人民的自治政府——炉山县凯里区苗族自治区人民政府已于一月二十八日正式成立。该自治区于一月二十五日召开了全区以苗族为主的各民族人民代表会议，听取和讨论了该区人民政府的工作报告和今后的工作任务。一年来，该区经过肃清土匪、特务和征粮工作，群众已有了初步的觉悟和组织，涌现出了许多为群众所拥护和爱戴的积极分子和干部。此次会议代行了人民代表大会职权，选出自治区人民政府区长顾怀安（苗族）及委员共十三人，其中苗族九人。
    会议期间，该自治区邻近各县、区的各民族人民均派代表到会祝贺。在该区举行的庆祝大会上，各乡人民曾表演各种歌舞。
    凯里区苗族自治区人民政府，是在中央人民政府西南各民族访问团第三分团的直接帮助与指导下成立的。该区共有人口四万余人，苗族人民占全区总人口的百分之八十八。
    【新华社重庆十六日电】由于人民政府正确地执行了民族政策，使居住在川康边境大小凉山区的彝族、汉族人民的生活日渐改善，两族人民间的关系也日趋和睦。
    在国民党反动政府大汉族主义者统治下，住在大小凉山区的彝族、汉族人民生活很苦，物资不易交流。两族人民间隔阂极深，彝胞不敢自由下山。从去年十月以来，该地人民政府大力进行了贸易工作，乐山专区百货公司即以十二万斤食油，十九万斤食盐和四百万尺土布供应该地人民需要；土产公司并在该地收购了七万五千斤五棓子、九万斤桐油、三万九千斤牛、羊皮及干果、药草等土产。由于大量物资交流和交易发达的结果，峨边县自去年十月份起，每次场集已从三日改为二日，屏山县去年七月时，商家不足一百户，至十月份已增至二百五十户。为解决彝胞食粮的困难，川南人民行政公署曾贷给他们粮食十三万斤。马边、峨边等县已召开了彝族代表会议，并有六位彝族代表出席了川南首届各界人民代表会议。
    在人民政府正确的民族政策影响下，大小凉山区的彝族人民，消除了以往不敢出山的顾虑，曾于去年八月及十二月两次组织参观团，先后参观了重庆、乐山、自贡、泸县等地的工厂和学校。参观团的代表阿分双喜、甘二怡等感激地说：“在国民党反动派统治时期，我们被人欺侮和残杀，现在我们能和各民族人民平等地生活在祖国的大家庭里，这是毛主席领导各民族人民革命，摧毁反动政府的结果。”峨边县彝族哈子点木干尔支首领木干尔，因为误受国民党残匪的欺骗宣传，曾在该县解放后，率领全支三百余名彝胞逃至小凉山。他们在深山中度过六个月缺油、缺盐、缺布的痛苦生活，终于在人民政府正确的民族政策争取下迁回峨边县，过着安居乐业的生活。
