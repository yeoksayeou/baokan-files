　　Land Reform Movement Unfolds in Over 20,000 Townships in East China

　　[Xinhua News Agency] The land reform movement in the vast rural areas of East China has been unfolding vigorously. Throughout the region, 22,757 townships (villages) have already completed or are in the process of carrying out land reform. Since November of last year, provinces and regions have successively conveyed the resolutions of the East China Second Land Reform Typical Experiment Experience Summary Conference, calling for "boldly mobilizing the masses and boldly launching the movement," and criticizing the phenomena of insufficient mass mobilization and some cadres taking over everything in certain regions. After this, the peasants in various places were widely mobilized, and millions of peasants launched reasoned struggles against the landlord class. They spontaneously rose up to control unlawful landlords, prohibiting them from speaking and acting recklessly. At the same time, local people's courts, based on the demands of the peasants, successively arrested unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries with major crimes and criminal evidence, and punished them according to the law. This measure greatly supported and encouraged the peasants and promoted the land reform movement.

　　Villages that have completed land reform everywhere present a new atmosphere. The political consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been raised. For example, peasants in Songjiang Special District, Southern Jiangsu, under the slogan of "Consolidating National Defense, Defending Emancipation," enthusiastically paid public grain. The entire district overfulfilled the autumn tax collection task in less than half a month. The people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside has also been further strengthened. After land reform in Jiangdu County, Northern Jiangsu, the membership of peasant associations quickly grew from 50,000 to 220,000. According to statistics from six districts including Fangcun District of PiSui County (south of the Longhai Railway, a newly established county from parts of the original Pi County and Suining County), a total of 2,900 village cadres were promoted during the land reform movement, and several hundred staff members with impure class backgrounds, impure work styles, and dissatisfaction from the masses were replaced, further transforming and enriching the grassroots government. After Bazi and other five townships in the first district of Licheng County, Shandong, finished distributing land, the people's representative conferences of each township immediately exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress and seriously elected the township people's government committees. In some old areas of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, at the end of land reform and the issuance of land certificates, peasants were mobilized to adjust land, and the problem of a few wrongly classified class components in the past was resolved. After the issuance of land certificates, the peasants were relieved, and unanimously believed: "With the issuance of land certificates, the land is rooted, and production is more vigorous."

　　Once land reform is completed in all new and old rural areas, the peasants immediately formulate plans for increased production and actively add farm implements and draught cattle to prepare for spring ploughing. Peasants in various places are now rehearsing new dramas, preparing to celebrate the first Spring Festival after the return of the land.

　　华东两万余乡展开土改运动
    【新华社讯】华东广大农村的土地改革运动，已经轰轰烈烈地展开了。全区已经完成和正在进行土地改革的已有二万二千七百五十七个乡（村）。自去年十一月以来，各省区先后传达了华东第二次土地改革典型试验经验总结会议的决议，号召“放手发动群众，大胆展开运动”，并批判了某些地区发动群众不够充分和若干干部包办代替的现象之后，各地农民就被广泛地发动起来了；千百万农民对地主阶级展开了说理斗争。他们自动起来管制不法地主，不准他们乱说乱动。同时，各地人民法庭也根据农民要求，先后将罪恶大的、有犯罪证据的不法地主和反革命分子加以逮捕，分别地依法惩处了他们。这一措施，大大支持和鼓舞了农民，推进了土地改革运动。
    已经完成了土地改革的乡村，到处呈现着一片新的气象。广大农民的政治觉悟提高了。如苏南松江专区农民，在“巩固国防，保卫翻身”的口号下，踊跃缴纳公粮。全区不到半个月，就超额完成了秋征任务。农村人民民主专政也进一步加强了。苏北江都县土地改革后，农民协会会员很快从五万人发展到二十二万人。据邳睢县（陇海路南，原邳县、睢宁各一部的新设县）房村区等六个区的统计，土地改革运动中共提拔了二千九百个乡村干部，撤换了几百个成份不纯、作风不纯、为群众所不满的工作人员，进一步改造和充实了基层政权。山东历城县第一区坝子等五个乡分完土地后，各乡的人民代表会议立即代行了人民代表大会的职权，认真选举了乡人民政府委员会。山东、苏北部分老区，在结束土地改革，发土地证中，发动农民调剂了土地，并解决了过去少数错订成份的问题。颁发土地证后，农民都放宽了心，一致认为：“发了土地证，土地扎了根，生产更有劲了。”
    所有新、老区农村一经完成土地改革，农民们都立即订了增产的计划，并积极添置农具耕牛，准备春耕。各地农民，现在正在排演新剧，准备欢度土地回家后的第一个春节。
