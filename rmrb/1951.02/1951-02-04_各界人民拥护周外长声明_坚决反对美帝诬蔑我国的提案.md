(Report from our newspaper) The United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States government, illegally passed a proposal by the United States to slander our country, arousing boundless anger among people from all walks of life, and unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement regarding this defamatory case. A spokesperson for the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement on the US imperialist proposal to slander our country, saying: All members of our China Democratic National Construction Association resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's righteous and stern statement. Our national industrial and commercial circles can now further recognize that US imperialism is an unforgivable deadly enemy of the Chinese people! We should further support the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, thoroughly implement the Patriotic Compact, increase production, stabilize prices, and expand consolation and relief work. We must also especially heighten our vigilance against the US imperialist conspiracy of aggression, fundamentally eliminate the thought of compromise and peace with US imperialism, and be determined to thoroughly defeat US imperialism before we are done! The September 3rd Society issued a written statement saying: We sincerely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. We absolutely cannot tolerate the US imperialist robbers' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression and undermine peace in Asia and the world. We must call on the people of the world to unite and completely smash all the aggressive plans of US imperialism. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a statement, expressing its full support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and firmly protesting against the US imperialist attempt to distort the facts and slander our country. The statement said: We literary and art workers, together with the people of the whole country, will act more resolutely in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and shatter the aggression of US imperialism. The person in charge of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement, representing all the workers in Beijing, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and calling on all workers in the city to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. The Beijing Postal District Trade Union held a temporary committee meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd for this purpose, passed a resolution, representing more than 4,000 postal workers in the district, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, denouncing the unreasonable measures of US imperialism, and calling on grassroots trade unions to organize employee forums to discuss Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Professor Qian Duansheng, Dean of the Law School of Peking University, believes that since launching the war of aggression against Korea, US imperialism has long disregarded any provisions of the United Nations Charter, and expressed his warm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Cheng Xianze, chairman of the student union of the university, said: The students of Peking University fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement; we are fully capable of smashing the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its aggression. Students from the Second and Third Mechanical Engineering Departments, Geology Department, and Sociology Department of Tsinghua University all discussed Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The student union of Beijing Normal University issued a protest letter on behalf of all students. On the 3rd, Fu Jen Catholic University was electing representatives to attend the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality. After seeing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement published in this newspaper, they immediately read it aloud. All the teachers and students present were extremely indignant at the proposal to slander our country and unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. President Chen Yuan declared on the spot: "We resolutely oppose the US imperialist manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass a motion to slander us!" All teachers, students and staff of the school issued a declaration supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Students from the Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College studied Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement, and some classes held discussions. All the students of the school passed a declaration denouncing the US imperialism's deliberate expansion of the war of aggression. Teachers and students of Hebei High School believe that no matter what tricks US imperialism plays, it will absolutely not be able to stop the just action of our people to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the determination of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose aggression.
