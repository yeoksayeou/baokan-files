    Stop Indiscriminately Assigning Corvée Labor to the Masses
    To the Editor:
    On January 27th, three cadres from the Third District of Ji County (Hebei Province), Geng Boxiang, Zhang Zhimian, and Wang Fengxiu, went to Hengshui County to attend a meeting. The three of them ordered the peasants of the district to provide a large cart to send their luggage to the Ji County Committee. Then, they each rode their bicycles to the County Committee. The cart came from Dongmeng Village in the Third District (about forty *li* from Ji County). The cart only carried three pieces of luggage, taking most of the day, and arriving in the city at eight or nine o'clock at night. After the cart driver arrived at the County Committee, he didn't know who to hand the things over to. Only after Comrade Liu from the Ji County Youth League Committee inquired, did someone store the things and lead him to the County Committee for dinner. Because no one took care of his accommodation, the cart driver had to spend the night in the shed in front of the office building. He said unhappily: "Why did we make such a big effort for just these few quilts? It would have been better to carry them here!"
    We believe that Geng Boxiang and the other two comrades should and could have brought their luggage to the city themselves by bicycle. For these three pieces of light luggage, they dispatched a large cart, wasting two days of the carter's time on muddy roads where the snow had not yet melted. This is a waste of manpower and a lack of mass perspective. We hope that Comrade Geng Boxiang and the other two comrades will make a profound self-criticism of this and strengthen their mass perspective in their practical work.

### 要禁止向群众乱派差

    要禁止向群众乱派差编辑同志：
    一月二十七日，我县（河北省冀县）三区干部耿伯翔、张治绵、王凤修三人到衡水县去开会，他们三人叫区里老百姓出了一辆大车，把行李送到冀县委员会，然后各自骑着自行车来到县委会。这辆大车是三区东孟村的（距冀县城里四十来里路）。车上只拉着三件行李，费了多半天时间，到夜晚八、九点钟，才到达城里。赶车人到县委会后，也不知道把东西交给谁。后经冀县团委会刘同志询问后，才把东西收存起来，领他到县委会吃了晚饭。赶车人因无人照管住宿问题，只好在机关门前的厂棚里住了一夜。他不高兴地说：“只有这几床被子费了这么大劲干什么？还不如给他们扛了来呢！”
    我们认为耿伯翔等三个同志是应该而且能够自己用自行车把行李带到城里来的。他们为了这三个轻便的行李，就派一辆大车，使车夫在积雪未干泥泞难走的道路上，浪费了两天时间。这是浪费民力，缺乏群众观点的行为。希望耿伯翔等三同志对此作深刻检讨，并在实际工作中加强群众观点。
