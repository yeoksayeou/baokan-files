Tissue Therapy (Biogenic Stimulator Therapy)
　　Feilatov
Editor's Note: Tissue therapy is a major invention in the Soviet medical field and has been around for sixteen years. Tissue therapy has significant value in both medical applications and theoretical research on life phenomena. It is based on the principle that when the tissues of a biological organism encounter extremely unfavorable conditions for their survival, but not to the point of death, it will cause a strong biochemical change and produce a substance to strive to maintain its life. This substance is called "biogenic stimulator." Relying on the power of this substance, many kinds of diseases can be treated. During the Soviet Patriotic War, tissue therapy was widely used. Now, more than 150 cities and villages in the Soviet Union are promoting this medical method.
    In the progressive medical circles of people all over the world, tissue therapy has attracted great attention from medical researchers and physicians. Many places are seriously studying and promoting this therapy, and have achieved significant results. Here, we should draw the serious attention of our Chinese medical circles. Although a few people in our country's medical circles have already conducted research and application of tissue therapy, it is clear that it has not been seriously and comprehensively promoted. This conservative phenomenon should not exist in our country today. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to make every effort to advocate this new scientific invention.
    The author of this popular article is Feilatov, the inventor of tissue therapy. He was born in 1875 and is a 75-year-old medical scientist. He is an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and an academician of the All-Union Academy of Medical Sciences. Due to his great scientific inventions and outstanding contributions, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded him the title of Hero of Socialist Labor on his 75th birthday last July, and awarded him the Order of Lenin and the Gold "Hammer and Sickle" Medal. Prior to this, Feilatov had honorably received the Stalin Prize, the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and the Order of the Patriotic War.
    Tissue therapy, in essence, is a new medical treatment method. I proposed it in 1933, which started from the study of the problem of corneal transplantation from cadaver eyes. I should explain the detailed process of the development of tissue therapy in the past, because those facts are the basis of the modern tissue therapy that I am now recommending.
    I first determined that when tissues and organs are separated from the human or animal body, or similarly, when plant leaves are separated from the plant, and placed in conditions that are unfavorable to their survival but not fatal, biochemical changes occur. This change produces special substances that maintain the tissue's life mechanism and are accumulated in the tissues and organs. If this substance is placed in diseased tissues, they show extremely strong therapeutic effects.
    I call these substances generated in still living tissues biogenic stimulator (exciter). A more effective condition for human or animal tissues to generate biogenic stimulators is to preserve them at low temperatures (about 3 to 4 degrees above zero) for several days and nights. The development conditions for biogenic stimulators in green leafy plants (aloe, agave, plantain, beet, etc.) are to keep them in the dark for about twelve days and nights. As is well known, due to chlorophyll and sunlight, leaves can carry out carbon assimilation using carbon dioxide as a raw material. In the dark, the progress of metabolism is disrupted, leading to the biochemical changes and stimulator creation as indicated above.
    Tissues taken from the patient as biogenic stimulator treatment (such as his skin); tissues taken from others or corpses (such as skin left over from surgery, placenta); or tissues and organs taken from horned livestock, rabbits, and other animals can become a source of biogenic stimulators. Usually, the epidermis, muscles, or testicles of the lips or inner thighs are taken from animals. I published a paper on this method of using animal tissues in 1938, and it has been applied in the Filatov Eye Hospital in Ukraine for many years. Many papers and books describing this method in detail were published by the Ministry of Health of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1946.
    Tissues that have grown biogenic stimulators under the above conditions are surgically placed in a subcutaneous pocket (cut the patient's skin with a knife all the way to the subcutaneous tissue, and then use a knife to separate the skin from the subcutaneous tissue to make it into a bag shape - translator), preferably after perfect local anesthesia for the patient, and placed on the left side of his chest. After the wound is sutured, the stimulator will enter the organism from the tissue, stimulate the internal anti-inflammatory and regenerative processes, and help its recovery.
    As early as 1942, Dr. Skrozhinsky and I pointed out that biogenic stimulators are heat-resistant. After an hour at a high temperature of 120 degrees in a closed autoclave, they do not lose their ability, but even strengthen their effectiveness. Therefore, tissues containing a large amount of biogenic stimulators must be sterilized in a closed autoclave on the day of the operation; tissues must be transplanted into the patient's subcutaneous pocket in this way. Using unsterilized materials is dangerous, as it may cause internal infections. The initial examination of the giver of tissues for treatment (human or animal) cannot completely guarantee that infection will not occur. Therefore, unsterilized tissues cannot be used in human treatment.
    From the materials preserved under the above conditions, water immersion solutions can be prepared and given to patients for subcutaneous injection. The general method for preparing the extract is to grind the material in a mortar with 5-10 times the amount of water; the resulting porridge-like substance is allowed to stand for 2 hours at room temperature, heated to boiling for 1-2 minutes, and filtered through filter paper. Then heat it again and pour it into ampoules that have been sterilized in a high-pressure sterilizer at a high temperature of 120 degrees for 1 hour.
    In addition to their tissues and extracts, biological fluids (such as human or animal blood and cerebrospinal fluid) or organs (such as the lens and vitreous body of human or animal eyes) obtained from refrigerated corpses can also be used for therapeutic purposes. The subcutaneous injection dose of water extract of refrigerated tissue for adults is 0.5-1.0 C.C. per day.
    Tissue therapy can be performed by transplantation or injection. In the first case, if the disease is chronic, transplantation should be performed several times, usually once a month. In the second case, each course of treatment includes 30-40 injections. This course is repeated four to six times. During the treatment process, I combine injections and transplantation. For certain types of pulmonary tuberculosis and laryngeal tuberculosis, subcutaneous injections of the extract should be used in the smallest amount (0.1 C.C.), and transplantation surgery is best avoided.
    Tissue therapy can be combined with other treatments, such as antibacterial agents (such as sulfonamides, penicillin), vitamins (I like to use vitamin B1 to treat optic atrophy), physical methods, insulin method (for diabetes), mineral spring therapy, etc.
    The therapy with stored tissues has positive effects on many eye diseases, such as blepharitis, various keratitis, various choroiditis, optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, myopic chorioretinitis, trachoma, etc.
    Optic atrophy, a serious disease that can lead to blindness, receives significant therapeutic effects from tissue therapy, stopping the development of the disease and improving vision. I can give an example of the success of tissue therapy, such as the nurse Π, who suffered from optic atrophy due to injury and could not see anything for six months. Tissue therapy restored her eyesight to a working capacity. According to observations of more than a thousand cases of optic atrophy, it fully shows that tissue therapy has an excellent therapeutic effect on this disease.
    Tissue therapy has the most significant effect in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a serious eye disease. Tissue therapy in these cases treats patients, especially in the early stages of the disease, which may allow patients to fully restore their ability to work. Unfortunately, many doctors still announce to patients that their disease is incurable and do not perform tissue therapy for them. However, according to our observation of more than 500 cases, it proves that the treatment of this disease has the possibility of a fortunate outcome.
    More than a thousand cases of myopic retinal disease using tissue therapy have confirmed that it is not only possible to stop the development of the disease, but also to greatly improve the patient's vision.
    There is no need to elaborate on other eye diseases. In short, it should be noted that tissue therapy is a very powerful treatment method for ophthalmologists.
    Tissue therapy is also successful in the treatment of non-eye diseases. Lupus vulgaris that has not been cured by ordinary methods for many years can be treated with tissue therapy, according to many cases and long-term observations. Tissue therapy has brilliant results for various ulcers (including gastric ulcers). According to observations, particularly significant results are obtained with this method of treating Oriental boils (Пендинская　язва, Pendinsk ulcer). One hundred percent of patients are quickly cured, and there are no scars on the surface. Even a patient with 93 ulcers throughout the body was completely cured in a very short period of time. However, many doctors have not noticed such a powerful treatment method as tissue therapy in these cases.
    Tissue therapy can alleviate leprosy, heal many years of ulcers, painful neuritis, unbearable tinea, etc. Tissue therapy is extremely effective for reducing swelling of various tumors, especially esophageal stricture and urethral tumors after burns.
    Tissue therapy has also achieved great success in the treatment of gynecological diseases. This has been confirmed by observations of hundreds of experts.
    The use of tissue therapy is also very effective for bronchial asthma. Due to the use of tissue therapy, many patients who have had asthma attacks for many years have been cured.
    Tissue therapy has also achieved great success in the treatment of skin diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, eczema, scleroderma, as well as traumatic and ordinary epilepsy, various joint diseases, spondylitis, neuritis, early-onset dementia, gangrene; for malnutrition after dysentery in children, etc.; regarding typhus, tissue therapy can also alleviate brain symptoms. There are many other diseases for which tissue therapy has also proven to be the best method.
    During the Great Patriotic War, tissue therapy was widely used to treat the wounded. In 1941, we began to apply it very successfully in the Biqigorsky and Tashkent hospitals.
    Tissue therapy has once again been proven by me and my successors that it should not be silent in medicine. Obviously, tissue therapy cannot cure every patient's disease, but it can cure many patients' diseases and can almost benefit everyone. Biogenic stimulators do not act on microorganisms, but on the entire organism, improving its physiological mechanisms and affecting its metabolism. The nervous system also plays a significant role in biogenic stimulator therapy, just like its treatment for other organs.
    The discovery of tissue therapy can also be applied in veterinary medicine. In addition, biogenic stimulators can strengthen the evolution of plants.
    For clinical and laboratory research on tissue therapy, a hypothesis is necessary, which can be summarized in the following basic principles:
    When the surrounding environment makes the life mechanism of animal and plant tissues (especially leaves) separated from the organism difficult, then under these influences, it produces biochemical changes and generates a substance (biogenic stimulator) to maintain their biochemical life mechanism. Therefore, biogenic stimulators are generated by the entire living organism under adverse conditions that are not fatal; this has been confirmed by the laboratory of Professor Blagoveshchensky and my research institute (according to trauma, ultraviolet rays and X-rays, as well as poisoning, etc.). Ready-made biogenic stimulators can be found where the struggle for survival is taking place in nature. Thus, we can find them in the sludge of estuaries (which contains animal and plant microorganisms), in the leaves of autumn plants, in black soil, and in fermented lake mud.
    Adding biogenic stimulators strengthens the activity of yeast. Therefore, the increase in yeast activity in the biological body indicates the presence of biogenic stimulators.
    The research on biochemical biogenic stimulators was mostly done by Professor Blagoveshchensky and his students Chikalov, Toryuvikova, etc., as well as by my co-workers - Xie Shchelinkova, Yu Soyeva and Bibela.
    Biogenic stimulators are generated by living organisms under the influence of powerful but non-lethal adverse environments, which is a common law of all living things in nature. Therefore, biogenic stimulators are not the product of dead organisms, but the product of living tissues fighting for survival.
    Many biological, physiological and pathological phenomena can be explained from the perspective of biogenic stimulators.
    This article is intended to give readers a brief understanding of tissue therapy, and to avoid misunderstandings about its principles as it gradually improves and progresses.
    More detailed details about tissue therapy are recorded in my book "Corneal Transplantation and Tissue Therapy." (Medical Book Publishing House, published in 1945; Ukrainian text, published by Ukrainian Medical Book Publishing House in 1948), and also published in various magazines (such as "Doctor's Business," "Clinical Medicine," "Surgery," etc.).
    Tissue therapy has been widely promoted in the Soviet Union for sixteen years. We know that more than 150 villages and large cities are using this method. However, it cannot easily penetrate into the lives of all provincial medical workers. This hinders some doctors who have not accepted the new theory of tissue therapy, and hinders its progress in all clinical hospitals.
    The Soviet government pays close attention to the development of our domestic science and gives it help and support. The Ministry of Health of the entire Soviet Union, the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic support tissue therapy in every possible way. The Ministry of Health of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic also announced in 1948 that tissue therapy was a subject of the republic and established a special committee to study it. Now, the manufacturing plan for tissue therapy agents is being widely implemented in the Soviet Union.
    I have no doubt that tissue therapy will become a treasure of Soviet medicine, and all its activities are to serve the people.

专栏：

　　组织疗法（生物原刺激素治疗法）
　　费拉托夫
    编者按：组织疗法是苏联医学界的一个重大的发明，至今已有十六年的历史了。组织疗法无论在医疗的应用上和生命现象的理论研究上都有重大的价值。它根据一种原理，即生物有机体的组织，遇到对它的生存极为不利但还未至于死亡的恶劣情况下，就会引起一种生物化学性的强烈变化，而产生一种物质，来努力维持它的生命。这种物质被称为“生物原刺激素”。依靠这种物质的力量，可以治疗很多样的疾病。在苏联卫国战争时期，组织疗法应用得很广。现在苏联已有一百五十个以上的城市和乡村正推广着这种医疗法。
    在世界各国人民的进步医学界中，组织疗法引起了医学者和医师们极大的注意。许多地方认真地研究着，推行着这种疗法，并且得到显著的成效。在这里，我们应该提起我们中国医学界的严重注意。我国医学界虽也已经有少数人进行了组织疗法的研究和应用，但是显然还没有认真地加以尽可能的推广。这种保守的现象在今天的我国不应该存在。因此，我们认为有尽力提倡这种科学的新发明的必要。
    这篇通俗文章的作者就是组织疗法的发明者费拉托夫。他生于一八七五年，是七十五岁的老医学家。他是苏联乌克兰共和国科学院院士，全苏医药科学院院士。由于他的巨大科学发明和卓越的功绩，苏联最高苏维埃主席团于去年七月，在他的七十五岁诞辰，授给他以社会主义劳动英雄的称号，并授予列宁勋章和金质“镰锤”奖章。在此以前，费拉托夫已经光荣地获得了斯大林奖金、列宁勋章、劳动红旗勋章和卫国战争勋章。
    组织疗法，本质上是新的医学上的治疗方法，是我在一九三三年提出的，它是由于研究从尸体眼睛里取得的角膜的移植问题开始的。对于过去的组织疗法发展的详细经过我应该加以说明，因为那些事实是我现在所推荐的现代组织疗法的基础。
    我首先确定了：组织和器官，从人体或动物体中分离开来，或者同样的，植物的叶子从植物体分离开来，而放在对它们生存不利的但是还不至于杀死它们的情况下的时候，就发生生物化学性的改变。这种改变产生了维持组织生命机构的特殊物质而在组织和器官中被积累着。如果这种物质放到有病的组织里去，它们表示出效力极强的治疗作用。
    这些在依然是生活着的组织中生成的物质，我称它们为生物原刺激素（兴奋素）。人体组织或动物组织生成生物原刺激素的比较有效的条件是将它们在低温下（约零上三至四度）保存几昼夜。绿叶植物（芦荟、龙舌兰、车前、甜菜等等）生物原刺激素的发展条件是将它们在黑暗处保存约十二昼夜。如所周知，由于叶绿素和日光，叶子能以炭酸气为材料而进行炭素同化作用。在黑暗里，新陈代谢作用的进行被破坏，而引向如上所指出的生物化学性的改变和刺激素的造成。
    从病人身上取来的作为生物原刺激素治疗的组织（如他的皮肤）；从别人或尸体取来的组织（如外科手术剩余的皮肤，胎盘）；或从有角家畜、家兔及其他动物取来的组织和器官，都能成为生物原刺激素的泉源。普通从动物身上取的是嘴唇或腿部内侧的表皮、肌肉或睾丸。这种使用动物组织的方法，我已在一九三八年有论文发表了，并且多年来在乌克兰费拉托夫眼病院里应用着。关于这种方法记述较详的许多篇论文和书籍已于一九四六年由乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国保健部予以出版。
    由于上述的情况下而滋生了生物原刺激素的组织，经过外科手术的方法放到皮下囊里（用刀切开病人的皮肤，一直切到皮下组织，再用刀将皮肤与皮下组织剥离而使呈袋形——译者），最好是给病人作完善的局部麻醉而放在他胸部的左边。在伤口缝合之后，刺激素将由组织进入有机体，激动起他内部的消炎和新生的过程，并将助长其复原的作用。
    早在一九四二年，史柯罗金斯基博士和我即已指出生物原刺激素有抗热性，在密闭高压器中，一二○度的高温下，经过一小时以后，它们也并不因此丧失自己的能力，反而甚至加强了效力。因此，含有大量生物原刺激素的组织，必须于开刀之日放在密闭高压器中消毒；必须以这种方式把组织移植到病人的皮下囊里。使用未消毒过的材料是危险的，因为它可能引起内部的传染。作治疗用的组织的给予者（人或是动物）的开头的检查不能完全保证不发生传染。所以未经消毒的组织不能使用在人的治疗上。
    从上述条件下保存着的材料，可以制造水浸液而给病人作皮下注射。制备抽出液的一般的方式是把材料放在加有五——一○倍量的水的乳钵中研细；所得的粥糊状物，在室温下经过二小时，加热煮沸一到二分钟，经过滤纸过滤。然后再加热，把它倾入在高压消毒器中以一二○度高温消毒一小时的安瓿里。
    除去它们中的组织和抽出液之外，为了治疗的目的还可以用一些从冷藏的尸体取得的生物性液体（如人或动物的血液和脊髓液）或器官（如人或动物的眼的水晶体、玻璃体）。冷藏组织的水抽出液成人每天皮下注射量是○·五——一·○C．C．。
    组织治疗可以移植或注射的方式来进行，在第一种情形，如果病是慢性的，那么移植要做好几次，一般是每月一次。而第二种情形，每个疗程包括三○——四○次注射。这种疗程重复四到六次。在治疗过程中我是把注射和移植结合起来进行的。对于某些种肺结核和喉结核，抽出液的皮下注射要用最小量（○·一C．C．），而移植的手术最好不要做。
    组织治疗法可以与其他的治疗方法联合起来，例如制菌剂（如磺胺剂、青霉素），维他命（我喜欢采用维他命Ｂ1，治疗视神经萎缩症），物理方法，胰岛素法（治糖尿病），矿泉治疗法等等。
    经过储藏的组织的疗法对于许多眼病有正面的效果，例如，眼睑边缘炎症，各种角膜炎，各种脉络膜炎，视神经萎缩，网膜色素变性，近视性的脉络膜网膜炎，沙眼等等。
    视神经萎缩，这一重症，可能招致失明，而组织治疗法给予显著的治疗效果，停止了病状发展，提高了视力。我可以举一个由组织疗法得到成效的例子，如看护Π，她因受伤而患了视神经萎缩症，六个月里看不见东西，组织疗法使她恢复了有工作能力的视力。根据一千个以上视神经萎缩症病例的观察，充分表示了组织疗法对于这一病症有极好的治疗效果。
    组织疗法对于网膜色素变性这一严重的眼病的医治有最显著的效用。组织疗法在这些情况下医治病人，尤其是在病的初期阶段，可能使病人完全恢复劳动能力。可惜的是，许多医生到现在还向病人宣布说他们的病是不能医治的，而不为他们实行组织疗法。然而根据我们五百个以上病例的观察，证明这病的治疗是有幸运结果的可能性的。
    近视性的网膜病使用组织疗法的一千以上的病例，肯定了不但可能停止病的发展，而且还能大大的改善病人的视力。
    其他的眼病也无需赘述，总之应该注意的是组织疗法是眼科医师极有力的治疗方法。
    组织疗法对于非眼病的治疗也是成功的。没有以普通方法治愈的多年的狼疮，根据许多病例和长期的观察是可以使用组织疗法治疗的。组织疗法对于种种的溃疡（胃溃疡亦然）有着光辉的结果。根据观察，特别显著的结果是用这方法医治东方疖（Пендинская　язва，Pendinsk　ulcer）。百分之百的病人很快被治好，而且表面没有疤痕。甚至于对一个全身有九十三处溃疡的病人，在很短期中也完全治好了。可是许多医生在这些情况下并不曾注意到像组织疗法这样强有力的治疗方法。
    组织疗法能减轻癞病，医好多年的溃疡，痛苦的神经发炎，难以忍受的癣等等。组织疗法对于各种肿疡的消肿是极有效的，特别是烫伤后食道的狭窄和尿道肿疡。
    组织疗法关于妇科病的治疗亦同样的有极大的成就。这是数百个专家的观察所证实了的。
    使用组织疗法对支气管喘息病亦甚有效。由于使用组织疗法，许多病人发作多年的喘息医好了。
    组织疗法对于治疗皮肤病亦有大成就，例如：红斑狼疮、湿疹、皮肤硬化症，以及创伤性和普通性的癫痫病、各种关节病、脊椎炎、神经炎、早发性痴呆症、坏疽病，儿童患赤痢后营养不良等；关于斑疹伤寒，组织疗法也能减轻脑部的症状。还有许多别的病症，组织疗法亦表现出是最好的方法。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，为治疗负伤者，组织疗法是广泛地使用着的。一九四一年在毕启戈尔斯基和塔什干病院中，我们开始很成功地应用它。
    组织疗法再一次地为我与我的承继者证明了，它在医学中不应默默无闻。显然的，并不是组织疗法能医好每一个病人的病，而是能医好许多病人的病，并且差不多能给每个人好处。生物原刺激素不是对微生物，而是对整个有机体起作用，提高它的生理机构，影响它的代谢作用。神经系统在生物原刺激素治疗下亦起着显著的作用，就像它对于其他器官的治疗一样。
    组织疗法发现亦可在兽医学方面应用。此外，生物原刺激素能加强植物的演发。
    为了临床和实验室的研究组织疗法，臆说是必需的，这种臆说可以归纳在下列基本原理中：
    从有机体内分离出来的动物和植物的组织（尤其是叶子）当周围环境使它们生命机构受到困难的时候，那么在这些影响下，它就生产了生物化学性的改变，而生成一种物质（生物原刺激素），来维持它们生物化学性的生命机构。所以生物原刺激素是整个活的有机体处于不良情况，但是还不致于杀死它们的环境影响下开始生成的；这是由柏拉格维士称斯基教授和我的研究所的实验室中证实的（根据创伤、紫外线和Ｘ光，以及中毒等情形）。在自然界进行着生存斗争的地方能找到现成的生物原刺激素。这样，我们在河口的污泥中（其中含有动物性和植物性的微生物），在秋天的植物的叶子里，在黑土里，在发酵的湖泥里这些地方都找得到它们。
    加入生物原刺激素，酵母的活动就加强了。所以生物体内酵母作用的增高即表示有生物原刺激素存在。
    生物化学性生物原刺激素的研究，大部分工作是柏拉格维士称斯基教授和他的学生契卡洛、托余维柯娃等人，同样的也是由我的共同工作者们——谢士切林柯娃、余索叶娃和比别拉进行的。
    生物原刺激素是由于强有力但并非致死的恶劣环境影响下，活的有机体生成的，那是自然界中所有生物的共同规律。所以生物原刺激素不是死的有机体的产品，而是为生存而斗争的活的组织的产物。
    以生物原刺激素的观点可以得到许多生物学、生理学和病理学上的现象的解释。
    这篇文字意在给予读者们关于组织疗法的一个简明的了解。并且正在它逐渐改善进步的时候，不致于对它的原理发生误会。
    关于组织疗法比较详细的情节都记载在我写的“角膜移植与组织疗法”的书里。（医学书籍出版局，一九四五年出版；乌克兰文本，一九四八年乌克兰医学书籍出版局出版），也有发表在各种杂志上的（如《医生事业》、《临床医学》、《外科医术》等等）。
    组织疗法在苏联十六年中广泛地被推广了。我们知道的是有一五○个以上的村落和大城市正应用着这种方法。但是它并不能够很容易地渗入到所有外省的医务工作者的生活里去。而这就阻碍了部分的医生，他们没有接受新的组织疗法的学理，妨碍了在一切临床病院和医院中它的进步。
    苏维埃政府留心地注意我们国内科学的发展，给与它帮助和支持。全苏联、俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国和乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的保健部以各种可能做到的方法支持组织疗法。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国保健部在一九四八年还宣布组织疗法是共和国的课题，并且设立了研究它的专门委员会。现在在苏联广泛的实施着组织治疗药剂的制造方案。
    我不怀疑组织疗法之成为苏联医学的宝藏，它的一切活动是为了服务于人民。
