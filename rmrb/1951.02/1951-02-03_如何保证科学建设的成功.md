　　How to Guarantee the Success of Scientific Construction
　　Director of the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Hua Luogeng
　　Editor's note: This is an article published by Mr. Hua Luogeng in the first issue of the second volume of "Science Bulletin." In this article, he raised the issue of the work attitude of scientific workers, that is, how scientific workers should carry out selfless labor for the construction of the people's motherland and establish labor discipline; how to adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and develop criticism and self-criticism; how to overcome sectarianism, strengthen and consolidate the unity of the people's scientific workers, and strive to cultivate new scientific talents and absorb new scientific knowledge. Correctly solving these problems is necessary for the sound development of China's scientific work.
　　Recently, while studying the works of the revolutionary teacher Lenin, I especially loved reading his remarks around 1920, feeling extraordinarily intimate, as if this historical giant was lecturing us face to face, educating us earnestly. At that time, the Soviet Union had just been liberated from the siege, and the armed aggression launched by capitalists all over the world to besiege the Soviets was crushed by the armed forces of the heroic Soviet people, and the country gradually moved towards the road of industrial construction; this situation is very similar to that of our country today. No wonder that thirty years later, these speeches and proclamations are still as intimate and important to us as they were then. What he warned and pointed out is like instruction given directly, teaching us earnestly. Let me first quote a passage from Lenin's article on labor discipline at the beginning of 1920:
　　"Why did we defeat Yudenich, Kolchak, and Denikin, who were helped by capitalists all over the world? Why are we firmly convinced that we can now overcome economic sabotage and restore agriculture and industry? We defeated the landlords and capitalists because the Red Army soldiers and workers and peasants knew that they were fighting for their own vital cause. We defeated them because the entire working class and the best elements among all the peasants displayed unprecedented heroism and built miraculous feats in this war against the exploiters. They endured unprecedented hardships, were willing to sacrifice themselves, and ruthlessly eliminated all selfish and cowardly elements. Now we believe that we can defeat economic sabotage because the entire working class and the best elements among all the peasants are rising up with the same firm will, the same heroic spirit, and the same consciousness to fight. When millions of laborers are united as one and follow the excellent elements of their class, then victory will be guaranteed."
　　It is embarrassing to say that the revolution has been victorious throughout the country, and we scientific workers are now the working class. But if we calmly think about it, we will not find it difficult to discover that we have rarely shown "heroic miracles" in the revolutionary struggle. We have not endured unprecedented hardships for the revolution in the past, let alone self-sacrifice. To be more frank, we are mostly scientific workers from bourgeois or petty-bourgeois backgrounds, but now we are the working class. If we do not show the heroism that the working class should have in the process of national construction, work hard—self-sacrificing work, and no longer abandon the concepts of aloofness and selfishness, we are really sorry for the revolutionary martyrs who shed blood for the revolution, and sorry for the workers and peasants who support us with hard work. In the future, we will be eliminated and purged like human dregs.
　　Today, our slogan should be: Observe labor discipline. Our specific action guideline is to be selfless and not to evade difficult work. If victory requires us to sacrifice, we should "heroically go to justice and generously go to difficulties" to accept this due self-sacrifice.
　　To ensure labor discipline, we must carry out regular objective criticism and self-criticism, especially since most of us come from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie, and unfortunately have been subjected to long-term propaganda and education by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and have been educated in capitalist countries to varying degrees. If we are not vigilant at all times, and are negligent or paralyzed for a while, we will unconsciously go astray. Only criticism and self-criticism can guarantee the correctness of our actions. At the same time, due to the inferior roots of the petty bourgeoisie, the so-called "celebrity faction" and "scholar habits" are produced—these can really be called aliases for "those who do not observe labor discipline." People with this habit often write articles and do research when they are interested, but do not regard work as labor—essential labor every day. The only reliable tool to correct this mistake is criticism and self-criticism.
　　We cannot deny that, at the present stage, there may be some so-called "objective" difficulties in carrying out criticism. It seems that the "face problem" has deep-rooted habits in our country (especially among the so-called "literati") and thousands of years of history. We, who have understood certain businesses but do not have a deep enough political awareness, frankly and publicly review ourselves, not only can not achieve the expected results, but sometimes will turn "surface" into "underground," and turn "open struggle" into "underground struggle," so as to hinder the development of legitimate business.
　　But we cannot stop eating because of choking. On the one hand, we should start learning, hoping to thoroughly understand the purpose of serving the new society, abandon our more or less, seemingly absent, bourgeois consciousness, and cultivate the proletarian point of view as a guarantee for accepting criticism. But on the other hand, we may as well put forward some principled common problems for preliminary review, so that those who suffer from this disease can consciously save themselves. Of course, the following are only some temporary thoughts, and the author himself is also a patient of several diseases.
　　Let's start with what is related to our business:
　　1. Are we working hard enough on our current business? In the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, because we were employees, exploited, and oppressed, if we deliberately or unintentionally slackened off, it would have a negative effect. But today, a new China has emerged, and we are working hard for our own country. The new morality does not allow us to have the slightest intention of this kind—even unconscious performance is not allowed. We must deeply realize that many workers and peasants are working hard for us for our "millet."
　　2. Is our understanding of business profound enough? The author believes that what we require of scientific workers now is not only to be proficient in their job, but also to roughly know the nature of some jobs related to their position. For example, if we run a certain factory, of course, if our output is not enough, it will affect the production of other departments, but sometimes it is not enough, but it is not well coordinated, which will also waste materials. In short, we must specifically know the position of our work in the overall situation when we are responsible for a business. Although we are working hard in our position, we should also pay attention to the overall situation, pay attention to how to cooperate with others, and we must help others.
　　3. In the process of work, errors and deviations are possible for us scientific workers. A Western proverb says: "Only the dumb never say the wrong thing." Admitting mistakes is not a fault, but not admitting mistakes is a fault. All great scientists have the grace to admit mistakes, and everyone knows how to estimate the value of admitting mistakes. Therefore, we should dare to admit mistakes, even if admitting mistakes will affect our "scientific expert" title or the lofty position we have obtained, we should not hesitate. In other words, admitting mistakes will only improve your prestige among the masses. Truth—is the goal that scientists strive for all their lives. If we cannot dare to accept the truth and admit mistakes, it will fundamentally shake our position.
　　4. The combination of theory and application, many of our friends have committed localism and never consider the questions raised by others. In the era of reactionary rule, most theoretical scientists were unwilling to "condescend" to use their precious time to answer questions for practical departments. This isolated phenomenon should be absolutely corrected. Theoretical scientific workers should wholeheartedly help applied scientific workers solve the problems they raise, and applied scientific workers should sometimes wholeheartedly provide experimental proof for the results or predictions obtained by theorists.
　　The above is about the matters that individuals should pay attention to. For comrades who have scientific administrative work, the task is even greater. In addition to the above, I think we should also deeply review whether we have committed the following problems.
　　1. Is sectarianism at work? This is even more important in today's great era, because in the past, most scientists came from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and in the new democratic society, the vast majority of workers and peasants have begun to receive universal education. Soon, thousands of young scientific reserve troops will be added. If we do not properly arrange the cultivation of young scientific and technical personnel and cannot start from a fair perspective, it will be quite difficult to create a large number of talents in the future, which will affect the growth of our scientific seedlings.
　　2. The war criminal Hu Shi is a representative of a bad trend after the May Fourth Movement. He used his friends' relationship to collude with each other in the reactionary government at all times to replace everything. This bad trend hindered the progress of science. The most obvious example is that Fu Sinian's doing as the director of the Institute of History and Language of the Pseudo-Central Research Institute was not because of his academic contribution, but because he was a private party of Hu Shi.
　　3. Are working comrades and experts respected enough? In the past scientific circles, it is undeniable that a serious patriarchal style was committed in some departments. The department in the university was a family with the head of the department as the parent, the research institute was a family with the director as the parent, and the factory was a family with the director as the parent. All leaders led everything in the style of "parents." This is an unreasonable phenomenon that affects the entire work spirit and emotions. In fact, responsible comrades should deeply understand that the main thing to do a good job is to rely on the strength of the masses. Leaders should go deep into the masses, deeply understand the ideological situation of each "expert" and even each researcher, and all work should be carried out according to their specific situation.
　　4. Is our work development biased? We should not reject contact with some other departments because of the limitation of our own knowledge. Scholars often regard their own research as the center of the world. This is still excusable. Because decades of effort and focused in-depth research can easily lead to the illusion of self-centeredness. But if we are responsible for leadership, we should reject such mistakes, because China is a big country, and every department needs talents. We hope that everyone can give full play to their talents, and in the future, there will be people working in every branch of science. Do not abandon it because of your own small circle of views.
　　5. Is it out of touch with the overall situation of modern development? To determine a policy, we should have the knowledge of the entire development of this department—not the knowledge of hearing and seeing, but the more in-depth knowledge, so that we can determine policies, cultivate new people, and guide new directions. If we find our own shortcomings, we should immediately give up the responsible position and learn as soon as possible.
　　We should be happy because we have the workers and peasants as the "reservoir" of successors to our work. This incomparably great power also makes us more motivated to move forward. If the development of the times overtakes us, we should willingly accept their leadership. We must not—and cannot be obstacles to the times. If we unfortunately conflict with the progress of the times. Please listen to the slogan that Lenin shouted:
　　"Down with the selfish and self-interested, down with those who are self-seeking and speculative and want to escape work, down with those who are afraid to endure the necessary sacrifices for victory."
　　Here, I sincerely and enthusiastically encourage comrades who are enthusiastic about scientific work to always be loyal to the people's science. Finally, I want to shout even louder, long live labor discipline!

### 如何保证科学建设的成功

　　如何保证科学建设的成功
    中国科学院数学研究所所长  华罗庚
    编者按：这是华罗庚先生在《科学通报》第二卷第一期所发表的一篇文章。他在这篇文章中提出了关于科学工作者的工作态度的问题，这就是科学工作者应该怎样为人民祖国的建设事业而进行忘我的劳动，建立劳动纪律；怎样坚持真理，修正错误，展开批评与自我批评；怎样克服宗派主义，加强与巩固人民的科学工作者的团结，努力培养新的科学人才和吸收新的科学知识等问题。正确地解决这些问题，对于中国的科学工作的健全发展，是必要的。
    最近学习革命导师列宁的著作，我特别爱读他在一九二○年前后的言论，感觉得异常亲切，就好像这历史巨人，正面对着我们在演讲，在谆谆地教育我们。那时候苏联刚从围攻中解放出来，全世界资本主义者所发动来围攻苏维埃的武装侵略，被苏联英勇人民的武装力量所粉碎，国家逐渐走向工业建设的道路；这种情况和今天的我国，极相类似。无怪乎三十年后的今天，这些演讲和文告，对我们还是一样的亲切，一样的重要。他所告诫的和所指出的事情，就如耳提面命，对着我们谆谆地教导一般。我先来引一段在一九二○年初列宁在论劳动纪律一文中所说的：
    “为什么我们竟战胜了获有全世界资本家帮助的尤登尼奇、高尔察克和邓尼金呢？为什么我们坚信我们现在定能战胜经济破坏，定能恢复农业和工业呢？我们之所以战胜了地主资本家，是因为红军兵士和工农都知道他们是为自己的切身事业而奋斗。我们之所以战胜了，是因为整个工人阶级和全体农民中的优秀人物都在这次反剥削者的战争中表现了空前的英勇精神，建树了神勇奇迹。忍受了空前的困苦，甘愿自我牺牲，无情地排除了一切自私自利和贪生怕死的分子。现在我们之所以相信我们定能战胜经济破坏，是因为整个工人阶级和全体农民中的优秀人物，都用同样坚定的意志，同样英勇的精神并同样自觉地起来奋斗，当千百万劳动者团结得像一个人一样，跟随本阶级的优秀人物前进，那时胜利也就会有了保证。”
    说来惭愧，革命在全国范围内已获得胜利，我们科学工作者现在是工人阶级了。可是我们平心静气的思考一下，我们不难发现，我们很少在革命斗争中表现了“神勇奇迹”，我们过去并没有为了革命而忍受了空前困苦，更谈不到自我牺牲。更坦白些说，我们大都是资产阶级或小资产阶级出身的科学工作者，但现在我们是工人阶级了，如果我们不在建国过程中表现出工人阶级应有的英勇，努力工作——自我牺牲的工作，再不抛弃孤高自赏和自私自利的观念，我们实在对不起为革命流血的先烈们，对不起胼手砥足养活我们的工农大众，将来我们会如人类渣滓一般被淘汰，被肃清的。
    今天，我们的口号应当是：遵守劳动纪律，我们的具体行动的指针是大公无私的，不逃避艰难的工作，如果为了胜利而必须我们牺牲，我们就应当“英勇赴义，慷慨赴难”，去接受这应有的自我牺牲。
    对于劳动纪律的确保，我们必须展开经常的客观的批评和自我批评，特别是我们这一班人是大部分出身自资产阶级或小资产阶级，不幸而受过长期的国民党反动派的宣传和教育，而且或多或少地受了资本主义国家的教育的人们，如果我们不时刻警惕，一时疏忽或麻痹，我们就会下意识地走错了道路。惟有批评和自我批评，才能保证我们行动的正确性。同时由于小资产阶级的劣根性，产生了所谓“名士派”、“学者习气”——这实在都可以叫做不遵守“劳动纪律者”的别名。有这种习气的人，常是兴之所至，写些文章，做些研究，而不把工作当做劳动——天天不可少的劳动。纠正这种错误，唯一可靠的工具就是批评和自我批评。
    我们不能否认，就现阶段说来，进行批评可能有某些所谓“客观”的困难。好像“面子问题”吧，在我国就有根深蒂固的习气（尤其是在所谓“士大夫”之间）和成千年的历史，我们这批虽已了解某种业务，但政治觉悟不够深入的人，率直地公开检讨自己，不但不能获得预期的效果，甚且有时会化“表面”为“地下”，把“明争”变为“暗斗”，以致妨碍了正当业务的发展。
    但我们不能因噎废食。我们应当一方面开始学习，希望能彻底地了解为新的社会服务的目的，抛弃我们或有或无，若有若无的资产阶级的意识，培养成无产阶级的观点，来作为接受批评的保证。但另一方面，我们不妨提出几点原则性的通病，作初步的检讨，使患有此种疾病者可以自觉地自救。当然以下所提的仅仅是一时所想到的，同时作者自己也是若干种病的患者。
    先从和我们业务有关的说起：
    １、我们对当前业务工作的努力够不够呢？在国民党反动派统治时代因为我们是被雇佣者，是被剥削者，是被压迫者，如果我们有意无意之间怠工疏忽是有其消极作用的，但今天新中国产生了，我们为了自己的国家在努力工作，新的道德不允许我们再有丝毫如此的存心，——甚至连下意识的表现也是不许可的。我们要深刻地认识，为了我们的“小米”有不少工农大众在为我们辛苦地劳动着。
    ２、对业务的了解够深刻否？作者认为我们所要求现在的科学工作者不但能精通他的岗位工作，并且应当约略知道他本位附近所联系着的一些工作的性质。举例来说如果我们举办某种工厂，固然我们出品不够会影响到其他部门的生产，但有时不是不够，而是没有配合好，也会浪费材料的。总之我们负责一种业务，必须具体地知道我们这工作在全盘中所占的地位，对本位虽是努力工作，但也应当注意全面，注意如何配合他人并且必须去帮助他人。
    ３、我们科学工作者，在工作过程中，错误和偏差是可能发生的，西谚说：“天下唯有哑子，从来没有说错过话”。承认错误不是过失，不承认错误才是过失。大科学家谁都有承认错误的雅量，谁都知道如何估计承认错误的价值。所以我们应当勇于承认错误，就是承认会影响到我们所获有的“科学专家”的台衔或已得的崇高的地位，也应当在所不惜，换句话说，承认错误，只会提高你在群众的威信。真理——是科学家所终身致力的目的。如果我们不能勇于接受真理，承认错误，那将使我们的立场基本动摇。
    ４、理论和应用结合，我们很多朋友犯了本位主义，从来不考虑别人所提出的问题，在反动派统治的时代大部分的理论科学家，不肯“纾尊降贵”用他们宝贵的时间，为实用部门解答问题。这种孤立的现象应当绝对纠正过来，理论科学工作者应当全心全力的帮助应用科学工作者解决他们所提出的问题，而应用科学工作者，有时也应当全心全力地为理论家所得出的结果或预测举出实验的证明。
    以上所说是关于个人所应注意的事项，对于另有科学行政工作的同志则任务更大，在上列所举的以外，我认为还应当深刻检讨，我们是否犯了下列诸项的毛病。
    １、是否有宗派主义在作祟，这对今天的大时代更为重要，因为以往的科学家大都出身自资产阶级及小资产阶级，而在新民主主义的社会里，极大多数的工农大众，已开始普遍受到教育，不久将大量地增添千千万万年青的科学后备军，如果我们对培养青年科学技术人员，不妥善布置，不能从公正方面入手，将来对大批人才的造就，发生相当的困难，而影响了我们科学幼苗的长成。
    ２、战犯胡适是五四以后一种坏风气的代表，他在反动政府中无时无刻不利用朋友的关系朋比为奸，来代替一切，这种坏风气阻碍了科学的进展，最明显的一例：是傅斯年之做伪中央研究院的历史语言所所长，就不是因为他对学术贡献的缘故，是他系胡适的私党而己。
    ３、对工作同志及专家够尊重否？以往的科学界，无可讳言地在若干部门犯了一个严重家长作风的错误，大学里的系是以系主任为家长的家，研究所是以所长为家长的家，工厂则以厂长为家长的家，一切领导人物以“家长”的作风来领导一切，这是不合理的现象，影响了整个工作精神和情绪。实在，负责同志应当深切了解要工作做得好，主要是依靠群众的力量，领导者要深入群众，深切了解每个“专家”的甚至每个研究人员的思想情况，一切的工作，应根据他们的具体情况而进行。
    ４、我们工作发展是否有偏向？我们不应当因为限于自己学识的关系而拒绝和若干其他部门的联系，学者们往往把自己的研究视为天地的中心。这还是有可原谅的。因为几十年的努力专心深入的研讨，很容易引入自我中心的错觉。但如果负责领导，则我们应当戒绝这样的错误，因为中国是一个大国，每一部门都需要人才，我们希望每个人都能尽其才，将来每门科学的分支，都有人工作着。不可因为自己小圈子的观点而偏废。
    ５、是否和近代发展的整个情况脱节？要确定一个政策，就应当有这一部门，整个发展的知识——不是以耳代目的知识而是较深入的知识，如此才可以确定政策、培养新人、指导新方向，如果我们一旦发现了自己不够的所在，我们就应当立刻放弃负责的地位而从速学习。
    我们应当庆幸，因为有了工农大众做我们工作的后继者的“蓄水湖”。这无比的伟大力量也使我们应当更奋发前进。如果时代的发展赶过了我们，我们应当心服情愿的接受他们的领导。我们切不可——同时也不能做时代的阻碍物，如果我们不幸和时代的进展起了冲突。请听列宁所高呼过的口号：
    “打倒自私自利分子，打倒那些专图私利和投机专想逃避工作的分子，打倒那些害怕为了胜利而忍受必要牺牲的分子”。
    在这里我虔诚地与热忱于科学工作的同志，互相勉励，永远矢忠于人民的科学，最后我更要高呼，劳动纪律万岁！
                              （一九五○年五月下旬于北京）
