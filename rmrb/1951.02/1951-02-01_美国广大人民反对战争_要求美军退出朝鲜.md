　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st: The New York correspondent of the London Worker's Daily reported on the 26th that almost two out of every three Americans believe that American troops should withdraw from Korea. This fact was only known after the Gallup Poll recently released the results of its public opinion poll on the Korean War. For the past three weeks, news from towns and cities in all 48 states across the United States has said that ordinary American people are already tired of the Korean War and they are demanding a comprehensive peaceful resolution. This public opinion poll has confirmed this news.
    In the Gallup poll, 66 percent of those surveyed said: "We should withdraw our troops from Korea as soon as possible."
    Furthermore, according to the New York Worker's Daily of the 23rd, a survey conducted by the "West Virginian Gazette" in Fairmont, the mining center of West Virginia, from January 17th to 19th, proved that the majority of residents favored the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea. On the first day, the result was 48 percent in favor of withdrawing from Korea, the second day it was 67 percent, and by the third day, the newspaper was unwilling to publish the figures.

　　美国广大人民反对战争
    要求美军退出朝鲜
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】伦敦工人日报纽约特派记者二十六日报道：几乎每三个美国人当中就有两个认为美国军队应该退出朝鲜。这个事实，是盖洛普民意测验所最近一次关于朝鲜战争的民意测验结果公布之后，人们才晓得的。过去三个星期以来，从美国全国四十八州各城镇来的消息就说，一般的美国老百姓已对朝鲜战争感到厌烦了，他们要求全面的和平解决。这次的民意测验，证实了这种消息。
    在盖洛普测验中，被询问的人有百分之六十六都说：“我们应该尽快把我们的军队撤出朝鲜。”
    又据二十三日的纽约工人日报载称，一月十七日到十九日“西弗吉尼亚人报”在西弗吉尼亚州的矿业中心斐尔芒举行了测验，结果证明大部分居民赞成美军撤出朝鲜。在第一天，结果是百分之四十八赞成退出朝鲜，第二天是百分之六十七，到了第三天，该报竟不愿发表数字了。
