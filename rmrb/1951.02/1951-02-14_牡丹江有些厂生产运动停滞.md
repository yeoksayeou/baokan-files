　　Production Stagnation in Some Factories in Mudanjiang

Since the launch of the patriotic production campaign in Mudanjiang City, many factories have seen increases in output, quality, and attendance rates compared to before. However, due to the lack of thoroughness on the part of the leadership in some factories, insufficient propaganda and mobilization efforts, and inadequate inspection work, the campaign has stagnated, worker morale is low, and production has suffered. In December of last year, the average output of a weaving machine at the Mudanjiang Textile Factory was 4.6 to 4.7 yards, but by mid-January of this year, the output had dropped to 3.7 to 3.8 yards; the quality decreased from 0.125 pounds to 0.4 pounds. The quality of fine spinning is also not as good as in December, with more neps, slubs, and empty spindles. At the same time, the attendance rate has also decreased. Since the launch of the patriotic production campaign at the Songjiang Paper Mill in late November, nearly two months have passed, and the leadership has not conducted a single inspection. The competition conditions that everyone originally set were very vague, such as "strengthening internal solidarity among employees" and "promoting enthusiasm and creativity," but the leadership is satisfied with these superficial slogans. When workers discover problems with the pulverizer in their actual work and suggest repairs to the administration, the administrative leaders do not give it serious consideration or adopt it. At the beginning of the competition, the workers at the Leather Factory were very motivated, and they voluntarily arrived at the factory ten minutes early to work. In the initial period, there were no rejects, and the quality of the leather improved; employees inspected each other during shift changes and studied technology once a day. However, due to the lack of inspection and encouragement from the leadership, these systems and methods can no longer be maintained in many cases. The advanced group studying Ma Hengchang's experience has also become a formality. The leading comrades do not correct this in a timely manner, but instead want to wait until after the Spring Festival before re-launching the campaign with renewed vigor. The result of doing this will inevitably lead to abnormal fluctuations in production.

### 牡丹江有些厂生产运动停滞

　　牡丹江有些厂生产运动停滞
    牡丹江市各工厂自开展爱国主义生产竞赛以来，很多工厂的产量、质量和出勤率均比前提高了。但由于部分工厂领导不深入，未很好进行宣传鼓动与检查工作，致使运动停滞不前，工人情绪低落，生产受到损失。牡丹江纺织厂在去年十二月平均一台织机的产量是四码六、七，至今年一月中旬，产量降低为三码七、八；质量从零点一二五磅降到零点四磅。精纺的质量也不如十二月份好，疙疸、棒棉、空锭子也都增多了。同时，出勤率也降低了。松江造纸厂自十一月下旬展开爱国主义生产竞赛以来，迄今将近两个月，领导上未进行过一次检查。原来大家订的竞赛条件就很空洞，如什么“加强职工内部大团结”、“发扬积极性与创造性”等，而领导上却满足于这些表面口号。当工人在实际工作中发现粉碎机有毛病，并向行政建议检修时，行政领导干部却不予很好的考虑和采纳。制革厂在竞赛开始时，工人劲头很大，他们自动提前十分钟到工厂干活。最初一个时期，一件废品也没有，皮子质量提高；交接班时职工都互相检查，每天研究一次技术。但由于领导上缺少检查和鼓励，现在这些制度和办法多不能坚持。学习马恒昌经验的先进小组也流于形式。领导同志对此不及时纠正，反要等过春节后，再重打旗鼓重开张。这样作的结果，就一定会造成生产中忽高忽低的不正常现象。
