　　Remembering General Kim Chaek
    Chuān Ruò
    On October 25, 1950, after I followed the Chinese People's Volunteers into northern Korea, I met General Kim Chaek, the frontline commander of the Korean People's Army, in a certain place. I never expected that this first meeting would be the last!
    Those were the most tense days. The American invading army had crossed the 38th parallel and was frantically attacking North Korea, approaching the border of our great motherland—the Yalu River. The entire Korean people and the People's Army were engaged in heroic and arduous resistance. Our volunteer forces rushed to aid day and night with indignation.
    One clear morning, the sun shone on the earth. The villages, houses, cars, and straw stacks that were bombed and burned by enemy planes yesterday were still burning, and the stench of burning filled the air. The hateful enemy fighter planes were making strange noises and began to circle.
    Comrade Kim Jun-seong, the artillery chief of staff of a certain brigade of the People's Army, personally led me into the city. He walked calmly and said to me, "This is the only complete city I have seen, but I don't know if it can survive today!" Before he finished speaking, the enemy planes opened fire on this peaceful city. A patch of green vegetable field was instantly turned black. The North Korean Farmers Bank Building was hit by a huge bomb, the beams were broken, and the roof collapsed. The doors, windows, and glass were shattered and flew dozens of steps away. Children cried, holding their parents who had been bombed to death, their bodies covered in blood. Dozens of tongues of fire rose in the city, spewing smoke into the sky. Government personnel at all levels, braving the enemy's bombing, all joined the fire brigade. They had no water hoses, each person took a long rake to pull down the nearby houses that had not been burned, in order to prevent the fire from spreading. They were brave enough to wet their clothes and go in and out of the smoke and fire. What a tragic scene!
    It was at this time that I met General Kim Chaek. He did not leave the city, nor did he enter the air-raid shelter. His great will made him forget that enemy planes were bombing wildly. His huge physique, dressed in a neat uniform and high boots, without a military cap, showed that he had begun to bald. He stood by the fire, glaring at the burning of his motherland's city by enemy planes. He ordered all guard units to join the fire fighting.
    The frontline command was so tense and orderly that no one stopped working even in the midst of bomb explosions. General Kim Chaek took my hand and led me into his office, and we began to talk.
    "We are often fighting with fire. Now there is not a single intact city in the whole country! This is the 'civilization' of the Americans in Korea."
    "The policy of the Americans and the Lee Seung-man gang is terror, massacre, and arson..."
    After he listed several heroic stories of the People's Army's operations, he said resolutely: "The enemy is really brutal! Our troops are really brave! This is the characteristic of the Korean battlefield." Then he said: "No matter how brutal the enemy is, as long as there is one person left in Korea, we will fight to the end; we will not forget the pain of 36 years of national subjugation, and the liberated Korean people must not surrender to the invaders!"
    After he introduced the current enemy situation, I asked a few questions, and he answered them all frankly. Because I was anxious to follow the troops forward, I hurriedly said goodbye to him. He held my hand tightly and sent me out of the door. "Dear Comrade! You represent the Chinese people's iron will to defend peace and help the Korean people resist the aggressors. On behalf of the 30 million Korean people, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers! And will never forget! We are determined to fight side by side and advance shoulder to shoulder: until the American aggressors are defeated!" As he spoke, he held my hand tightly. I looked at him and suddenly found that his eyes, which were red from working all night and lack of sleep, were filled with tears.

　　忆金策将军
    川若
    一九五○年十月二十五日，我随着我国人民志愿军进入朝鲜北部之后在某地会见了朝鲜人民军前线司令金策将军，想不到这最初的会见，竟成为最后的会见了！
    那是最紧张的日子，美国侵略军已越过三八线，向北朝鲜疯狂进攻，并且逼近我伟大祖国的边境——鸭绿江畔，全朝鲜人民和人民军进行着英勇艰苦的抗战，我志愿军各部以怒不可遏的姿态星夜驰援。
    一个清朗的早晨，太阳普照着大地，昨天被敌机炸烧的村镇、屋舍、汽车、稻草堆，还在继续燃烧着，到处弥漫着焦臭的恶味，而可恶的敌战斗机群，又在发着怪声，开始盘旋起来。
    人民军某旅团炮兵参谋长金俊成同志，亲自把我领进市内，他一边镇静地走着，一边对我说：“这是我所见到的唯一完整的城市了，但不知它能不能熬过今天！”话犹未了，果然敌机向这和平的城市开火了，一片碧绿的青菜地，顿时变成焦黑；北朝鲜农民银行大厦，被一个巨弹命中，悬梁被炸断，屋顶倾坍下来，门窗和玻璃，被炸得稀碎，并飞在数十步之外。孩子们抱着被炸死的父母号泣，鲜血滚满全身。城内腾起数十只火舌，向着天空喷射烟雾。各级政府人员，冒着敌机轰炸，一齐参加了救火队。他们没有水龙，每人拿一根长挠勾，把附近没有烧着的房子拉倒，以防大火蔓延，他们勇敢到把衣服打湿，出入于烟火之中，这是多么悲壮的场面啊！？
    就在这时候，我见到金策将军。他没有离开这城市，也没有进防空洞，伟大的意志，使他忘记了敌机正在狂炸。他那巨大的体魄，穿着整齐的制服和高靴，没有戴军帽，可以看出他已开始秃顶。他站在烟火旁，怒视着祖国的城市被敌机炸烧。他命令所有警卫部队都参加救火。
    前线司令部是这样紧张和有秩序，就在炸弹爆炸声中，也没有一个人停止工作。金策将军牵着我的手，进到他的办公室内，我们开始了谈话。
    “我们经常是和火搏斗的，现在全国已经找不出一个完好的城市了！这就是美国人在朝鲜的文明。”
    “美国人和李承晚匪帮的政策，就是恐怖、屠杀和焚烧……”
    他列举了几个人民军作战的英雄故事以后，坚决地说：“敌人真残暴啊！我们的部队真勇敢啊！这就是朝鲜战场的特点。”接着又说：“不管敌人如何残暴，只要朝鲜还有一个人，就要作战到底的；三十六年的亡国惨痛，我们不会忘记，解放了的朝鲜人民，决不能向侵略者屈服！”
    他介绍了当前的敌情后，我提出几个问题，他却爽快地一一作了答复。我因急于随部队前进，匆匆向他告别。他紧握着我的手，一直送到门外。“亲爱的同志！你们代表中国人民保卫和平的钢铁意志，援助朝鲜人民抵抗侵略者，这种伟大的国际主义精神，我代表三千万朝鲜人民，向中国人民志愿军表示衷心的感谢！并且永世不忘！我们决计携手作战，并肩前进：直到打倒美国侵略者！”他一面说着，一面紧握着我的手，我注视着他，忽然发现他那因为连夜工作以致睡眠不足而发红的眼睛涌出一股一股的热泪。
