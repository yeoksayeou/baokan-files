　　Overcoming the Bad Habit of Strange Cheers
　　Dong Juxian
    This New Year, I watched Xin Fengxia perform in "The True Story of Ah Q." Because I was sitting in the last row, I particularly felt how important the relationship between the stage and the audience is during a theatrical performance. Before "The True Story of Ah Q," there was "Harmonious Family" (Killing the Dog to Advise Her Husband). Because the content and form of this play had not yet broken away from the old conventions, the noisy, laughing, and cheering sounds from the audience were constant. People sitting in the back row had to use a lot of effort to hear what was being sung on stage! When Xin Fengxia, playing Xianglin's Wife, first appeared, the situation in the theater did not change. It wasn't until Xianglin's Wife was later tricked into marrying He Laoliu, and she refused, breaking her head on the table during the wedding ceremony, that the development of the plot captivated the audience.
    The audience actually listened to Xianglin's Wife's long aria very quietly! And from then on, the audience was basically stable. Only in two other places, because she overemphasized the changes in the final cadences, and in performing He Laoliu's death, nestling her face against his and hugging him in her arms, stroking his legs and stretching his feet, did the audience's emotions fluctuate again.
    This made me think: no matter what kind of audience, they can be persuaded by a good play. According to the analysis of insiders in the opera circle, in the past, there were as many as seven or eight categories of audience members who cheered in the theater, some who only listened to the singing, some who only watched the acting, and some who had no interest in either singing or acting, only looking at the actors' appearance. For many years, the tastes of these audiences have powerfully influenced and controlled the stage. Some obscene, vulgar, and low-level singing styles and performances have largely been developed by some actors in order to cater to the tastes of backward audiences. Xin Fengxia's excessive movements and unnatural changes in some final cadences when performing Xianglin's Wife and He Laoliu's death can all be seen as traces of this.
    To overcome the bad habit of strange cheers in the theater, I think there are two basic keys: one is the actor's awareness. If the actor can earnestly engage in artistic creation and seriously express the content of a play, as Xin Fengxia has begun to achieve in Xianglin's Wife, strange cheers will naturally disappear. Actors cannot measure the quality of their performance by cheers. Cheng Changgeng, a famous Qing Dynasty actor, advocated that no one should cheer during his performance, not even princes, ministers, or the emperor. His view was this: "My play is good, there is no need for applause, let alone wild shouting. If everyone's voices are mixed up, even if I sing well, you will not be able to hear it; if everyone is quiet, I can sing (alone)." (Material from "Qing Dynasty Yandu Liyuan Historical Materials") This shows that the traditional Chinese opera art also opposed strange cheers. The second is the audience's moral issue. Because watching a play is a collective art appreciation, one person may think the singing is good, another may think the acting is good, and others may think the makeup is good. Each person's cultivation and taste are different, so the appreciation obtained is also different. If everyone were to shout loudly and wildly when they were satisfied, others would not be able to engage in artistic appreciation. Therefore, strange cheers are a very impolite behavior. Especially when watching operas or plays, a person's laughter or sudden applause will affect the entire theater. If the actor's performance art is really praised by the audience, then it is best to applaud after his performance, which is not only natural but also reasonable.

### 克服怪声叫好的恶习

　　克服怪声叫好的恶习
　　董聚贤
    新年看新凤霞演出《祥林嫂》，由于坐在最后一排，所以特别感到在一次戏曲演出中台上台下的关系是多么重要。在《祥林嫂》这个戏之前，是《和睦家庭》（杀狗劝夫），由于这个戏的内容和形式上都还没有脱离旧的圈套，所以台下闹嚷、嘻笑、叫好的声音一直不断。坐在后排的人，简直要用很大的力气才能听出台上在唱什么！新凤霞扮的祥林嫂，开始出台时，场里的情况并没有改变。直等到祥林嫂后来被骗嫁给贺老六，她不答应，拜堂时在桌上碰破了头后，剧情的发展才把观众攫住。
    观众居然很安静地把祥林嫂有一段很长的唱词听完了！而且自此之后，观众便基本上稳定下来。只是在另两个地方，由于她过于着重了尾腔的变化，和表演贺老六死时，跟他脸儿相偎，并搂在怀里抹腿舒脚的情形，观众的情绪才又浮动起来。
    从这里使我想到：无论什么观众，都是可以被好戏说服的。根据戏曲界内行人的分析，从前观众在剧场中叫好的，竟有七类八派之多，有专听唱工的，有专看作工的，也有对唱工作工都没有兴趣，只看演员长相的。许多年来，这些观众的趣味有力地影响着和左右着台上。某些淫荡猥亵、低级无聊的唱腔和表演，大体上都是因为某些演员为了要迎合落后观众的趣味，而慢慢发展起来的。新凤霞这次在表演祥林嫂和贺老六死时那种过火的动作以及某些尾腔不自然的变化，都可以看出这种痕迹。
    要在剧场中克服怪声叫好的恶习气，我以为有两个基本的关键：一个是演员的觉悟。演员能够认真从事一种艺术的创造，严肃地来表达一个戏的内容，如象新凤霞在祥林嫂中所开始达到的那样，怪声叫好自然便不会有了。演员自己表演好坏，不能从叫好来衡量，清代名伶程长庚，就曾主张在他表演时就不要有任何人叫好，连王公大臣皇帝在内。他的看法是这样：“我的戏好，无须喝彩，更不要狂叫。大家的声音一繁杂，我即使唱得好，你们也听不见；大家都安静，我便可以独自叫天（唱）了。”（材料见《清代燕都梨园史料》）足见中国旧剧艺术传统上也是反对怪声叫好的。第二是观众的道德问题。因为看戏是一种集体艺术的欣赏，一个人觉得唱得好，另一个人觉得作得好，其他的人觉得化装好，各人修养趣味不同，欣赏所得也就不同。每人到了称心得意的时候，要都大声狂叫起来，其他的人就无法进行艺术欣赏了。因此，怪声叫好是一种很不礼貌的行为。尤其是在看歌剧话剧，一个人的嘻笑或突然鼓掌，将会使整个剧场受到影响。演员的表演艺术，如果真的被观众所称赞，那么最好是在他表演结束之后，报之以掌声，这不但是自然的，而且是合理的。
