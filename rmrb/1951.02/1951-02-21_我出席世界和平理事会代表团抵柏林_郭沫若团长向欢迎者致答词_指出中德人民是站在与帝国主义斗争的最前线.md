Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council, led by Guo Moruo, arrived in Berlin on the 19th from Moscow to attend the Council meeting to be held in Berlin on the 21st. Those who welcomed them at the airport included Mr. Swig, representative of the German Peace Committee, Professor Havermann, President of the University of Berlin and Chairman of the Berlin Peace Committee, Professor Nayas, Director of the German Academy of Sciences, and Mrs. Tzeisel, representative of the government of the German Democratic Republic, Mrs. Fabisi, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education, and many others. General Ji Pengfei, head of our country's diplomatic mission to the German Democratic Republic, and members of the mission also welcomed them at the airport. Swig and other representatives delivered welcoming speeches respectively. Leader Guo Moruo delivered the following reply: Dear friends:

　　The Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council feels very happy and excited to be able to come to Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, today.

　　The Chinese people will never forget the great historical day of October 1949, when, just one week after the Chinese people created their own republic, they welcomed the birth of the German Democratic Republic.

　　We are very pleased that within a week, two powerful democratic fortresses have sprung up in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, guarding world peace from the Pacific Ocean to the Elbe River, at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism.

　　On this basis, our Chinese delegation, together with delegations from people of all countries in the world, has come to Berlin, the capital of the German people, to discuss important issues related to world peace and to work together to strive for lasting world peace. People all over the world will see: the famous city destroyed by Hitler's crimes now stands in the center of Europe as a peaceful capital again.

　　Since October 1949, the world peace and democracy movement has developed greatly. We deeply recognize that every victory of the German people in striving for democratic unification and a just peace treaty is a major contribution to the cause of world peace.

　　Now, the American and British imperialists are arrogantly trying to split Germany for a long time, and use the enemies of the German people—Nazi elements and revanchists—to rearm West Germany as a gamble to launch aggression in Europe. However, we believe that the entire German people are firmly opposed to it, and with the joint efforts of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the German people's struggle will surely win a glorious victory.

　　Long live a unified and democratic Germany!

　　Long live President Pieck, leader of the German people!

　　Long live the victory of world peace!

    郭沫若团长向欢迎者致答词
    指出中德人民是站在与帝国主义斗争的最前线
    【新华社柏林二十日电】由郭沫若率领的中国出席世界和平理事会代表团，于十九日自莫斯科飞抵柏林，出席二十一日在柏林举行的理事会会议。到机场欢迎者有德国和平委员会代表斯威格，柏林大学校长、柏林和平委员会主席哈佛曼教授，德国科学院主任纳亚斯教授和德意志民主共和国政府代表柴塞尔夫人，教育部秘书长法比西夫人等多人。我国驻德意志民主共和国外交使团团长姬鹏飞将军及使团人员亦到机场欢迎。斯威格及其他代表分别致欢迎词，郭沫若团长致答词如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    中国出席世界和平理事会代表团，能在今天来到德意志民主共和国的首都柏林，衷心感到十分愉快，十分兴奋。
    中国人民永远不能忘记一九四九年十月的具有伟大历史意义的日子，那时，中国人民在创建了自己的共和国刚刚一个星期以后，就又迎接了德意志民主共和国的诞生。
    我们十分欣慰，在一个星期之内，在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营之中，兴起了两个强大的民主堡垒，从太平洋到易北河、在与帝国主义斗争的最前线，警卫着世界和平。
    在这个基础上，我们中国代表团、会同世界各国人民的代表团，来到了德国人民的首都——柏林，讨论有关世界和平的各项重大问题，为争取世界持久和平而共同努力。全世界人民都会看到：由于希特勒的罪恶所毁坏了的名城，现在又以一个和平的首都的姿态，矗立在欧洲的中心了。
    从一九四九年十月以来，全世界和平民主运动已大大向前发展。我们深深地认识到德国人民在争取民主统一与公正和约方面的每一个胜利，都是对世界和平事业的重大贡献。
    现在，美英帝国主义者正在狂妄地蠢动，企图使德国长久分裂，并利用德国人民的敌人——纳粹分子与复仇主义者，来重新武装西德，以作为在欧洲发动侵略的赌本。但是，我们相信：全德国人民是坚决反对的，在以苏联为首的全世界和平民主阵营的共同努力之下，德国人民的斗争定将获得光荣的胜利。
    统一、民主的德意志万岁！
    德国人民领袖皮克总统万岁！
    世界和平胜利万岁！
