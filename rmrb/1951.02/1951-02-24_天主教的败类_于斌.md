In August of last year, the notoriously sinful Yu Bin discovered that Chiang Kai-shek didn't have many foreign cronies left, so he hurriedly ran to Madrid, the capital of Spain, with war criminals Chen Lifu and Zeng Qi to collude with Franco and discuss the issue of Chiang Kai-shek and Franco resuming diplomatic relations. Yu Bin has always admired Franco and envied Franco's espionage work. He thought that if Franco and Chiang Kai-shek hooked up, it might be of some use to the dying Chiang Kai-shek. Yu Bin had long heard that Franco had been praised by the Vatican as a "loyal son of the Catholic Church," and this "loyal son of the Catholic Church" was precisely Yu Bin's role model.

In fact, Yu Bin admired Mussolini even more than Franco. When Mussolini seized power in Italy and was called "the man given to us by God" by Pope Pius XI, Yu Bin was in Rome, acting as a loyal lackey of the Pope. Before Mussolini invaded Abyssinia, the Pope sent an "Abyssinia Investigation Group" to carry out conspiracies. Yu Bin was a member of this investigation group. When Mussolini annexed Abyssinia, the Pope said it was "a mission to spread civilization based on lofty philanthropy." Of course, Yu Bin admired this "mission to spread civilization" extremely. In 1933, in order to obtain a doctorate in Fascist politics, Yu Bin wrote a thesis in Rome praising Mussolini greatly, saying that Mussolini was the "savior of the world" and the "only meritorious official" of the Catholic Church. In 1932, in order to express his love for Mussolini, Yu Bin organized the "China-Italy Friendship Association," serving as its vice-president and vigorously promoting Fascism. Because Yu Bin was so enthusiastic about Fascism, in 1933 the Italian Emperor specially awarded him a Fascist medal and a knighthood. From then on, Yu Bin's status increased, and the Pope also appreciated him. In 1933, he was appointed as the "General Supervisor of the Chinese Catholic Action" and also served as the secretary of the Papal Legation in China. The following year - on July 7, 1936 - this Fascist knight was promoted to Bishop of the Nanjing District by the Pope.

When Yu Bin was in Rome, he maintained close contact with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Kong Xiangxi was Yu Bin's "best friend." During the ten years of anti-people civil war waged by Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Bin always helped Chiang Kai-shek and opposed the Chinese people.

When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out and Nanjing fell, Yu Bin hurriedly fled abroad and published a "Letter to European and American People" abroad. In the book, he shamelessly said: "The suppression of the Communists has taken ten years, only because the Communist Party endangers the entire country, this uncompromising method can be called righteous." At that time, the Chinese Communist Party was leading the entire Chinese people to unite and fight heroically to resist Japanese imperialism. But this loyal follower of Mussolini shouted that its "suppression of the Communists" "can be called righteous", he advocated attacking the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, he opposed the Chinese people's resistance against Japan, and he instigated Bishop Cai Ning to stay in Beiping and maintain close cooperation with Japanese imperialism. At that time, the Catholic "Yearbook of Church Affairs" openly recognized the puppet Manchukuo and the puppet Nanjing government.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yu Bin also actively engaged in anti-communist and anti-people espionage work: In New York, he founded the English-language China Monthly, slandering the Chinese Communist Party; and he opened the "Chinese Cultural College" in Washington. What kind of organization was this "Chinese Cultural College"? Even Yu Bin's accomplice - war criminal Hu Shi had to admit: "It is not a college, it has no culture, and it cannot be said to be Chinese culture." This "uncultured" college was an anti-communist and anti-people espionage agency. At the end of 1941, Yu Bin instigated priests in various places in the Chiang bandit-controlled area of Chongqing to organize the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association," serving as its chairman. This "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" had close ties with the C.C. special agent system and was Yu Bin's base for carrying out special agent activities. The Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao revealed the criminal facts of this organization on July 12, 1949.

As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan was won, Yu Bin hurried back to China from the Vatican, bringing back a personally signed photo given to the Chiang bandits by the Pope. Chiang Kai-shek paid Yu Bin 200 million puppet currency through Dai Li, allowing Yu Bin to run the Yi Shi Bao in six major cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Xi'an. At the same time, Yu Bin established the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" in Nanjing, attempting to establish branches in 130 dioceses across the country, and preparing to publish Yi Shi Bao in 25 major cities across the country. Yu Bin used these religious and cultural institutions to assist the Chiang bandits and oppose the Chinese people.

After the victory of World War II, American imperialism completely controlled the Vatican, attempting to use Catholicism to promote its policy of aggression. Yu Bin became one of the most loyal running dogs of American imperialism in its aggression against China. The Pope naturally loved this loyal running dog very much. As a result, Yu Bin was promoted to Archbishop of Nanjing by the Pope. When Yu Bin held the inauguration ceremony for the Archbishop on New Year's Day in 1947, Papal Envoy Liberi openly declared: Catholicism should assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's nation-building work (relying on American imperialism to attack the Chinese people).

How did Yu Bin assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in attacking the Chinese people? When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang frantically launched a civil war, Yu Bin, wearing a religious cloak, made political trips to the Northeast, North China, and South China, making reactionary remarks everywhere, slandering the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, in order to cooperate with the Chiang bandits in attacking the liberated areas. In 1946, he made four shameful speeches in Guangzhou. Once, he spread rumors to Guangzhou newspaper reporters, saying: "After the Communist army arrived in the Northeast... they looted wildly, and some cities were set on fire by the Communist army and turned into ashes; only in the areas recovered by the National Army (Chiang bandit army) did they present a thriving scene." At the beginning of 1947, he despicably fabricated the name of the "Northeast People's Representative Group" and requested that the Chiang bandits quickly "recover" various parts of the Northeast. He also directed espionage work in the Northeast behind the scenes, destroying the Chinese liberated areas. The Chinese People's Liberation Army fought heroically and continuously defeated the attacks of the Chiang bandit army supported by American imperialism. Seeing the power and invincibility of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yu Bin attempted to organize a "Catholic Anti-Communist Crusade" with the support of the American imperialist military advisory group stationed with the Chiang bandits, preparing to establish five armies in North China to support the Chiang bandits. But this attempt did not materialize, and Yu Bin was very sad. He had no choice but to seek help from American imperialists. During the People's Liberation War, he met with Truman twice to "strive for American aid." In 1948, he reported on his impressions of his visit to the United States at the Standing Committee of the Puppet National Political Council. He said that Truman had assured him: "Even in extremely difficult circumstances, the United States must actively and thoroughly aid Chiang." At the same time, he absorbed students from various places and expanded his espionage organization. He had long ago colluded with the Christian missionary who preached in Shanxi - American reactionary Congressman Zhou Yide, to absorb a group of middle school students to study in the United States for special agent training.

Despite the "active and thorough aid to Chiang" from American imperialism, and despite how Yu Bin and his ilk carried out special agent work, the Chinese People's Liberation War finally won. The Fascist knight, the running dog of American imperialism Yu Bin finally revealed his true fox form, ran to the United States, and used the "Chinese Cultural College" in Washington and the "English China Monthly" in New York as strongholds to openly carry out special agent activities. He also took orders from American imperialism to organize a Southeast Asian anti-communist spy network with Singapore as the center, stepping up his criminal activities against the people. He also appointed Mao Zhenxiang (a Chinese priest) to assist the infamous flying tiger Chennault in openly recruiting air force personnel in the United States in March 1949 to organize an "Air Force Volunteer Army" to help the Chiang bandits bomb the Chinese people. The Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao reported on July 13, 1949: Yu Bin's special agent system is being used by Mao Zhenxiang to collect Catholics among a group of students studying in the United States, giving them special agent training; at the same time, Lei Zhenyuan is training Catholic priests and monks who fled south from North China in Hong Kong, sending them back to the mainland to carry out sabotage activities.

The special agent running dog Yu Bin also constantly lobbied in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Mexico, and other countries, shamelessly requesting that these countries not recognize the People's Republic of China. He also stepped up his efforts to find hiding places for the Chiang bandits and their lackeys in Latin America. He requested the Chilean government through Cai Ning, the Papal Envoy to Chile, to allow the four major families to hide the funds they had plundered from the Chinese people for decades in Chile.

The running dogs have the same vicious heart of hatred for the Chinese people. Last year, Yu Bin and Hu Shi colluded to establish organizations such as "Free China" and "Blessed Society" in the United States to carry out their activities against the Chinese people. The American imperialists also took a fancy to these two piles of garbage, believing that they were the only people who could organize a "third force." American imperialism also wants to use these two running dogs to deceive the Chinese people and continue to harm the Chinese people.

The Chinese people and patriotic Catholics have long seen through Yu Bin's fox face. The Fascist knight, the important accomplice of the American Chiang bandit gang, Yu Bin, is the "ravenous wolf in sheep's clothing" that Jesus spoke of back then. Yu Bin is not only a war criminal that the Chinese people want to arrest, but also a "ravenous wolf" that Chinese Catholics want to eliminate. Every patriotic Catholic is irreconcilable with Yu Bin. It is necessary and proper for patriotic Catholics to resolutely express their determination to eliminate counter-revolutionaries in the church and sever ties with American imperialism in the independent and innovative movement, and it is warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. Yu Bin, who is deeply hated by the Chinese people and patriotic Catholics, will definitely be judged by the Chinese people.

　　天主教的败类——于斌
    陈迹
    去年八月，罪恶昭彰的于斌发现蒋介石的外国伙计不多了，就连忙和战犯陈立夫、曾琦跑到西班牙首都马德里，勾结佛朗哥，商谈蒋介石和佛朗哥恢复邦交问题。于斌一向就很崇拜佛朗哥，羡慕佛朗哥的间谍工作。他以为佛朗哥和蒋介石勾搭起来，对于垂死的蒋介石或许有点用处。于斌很早就听说，佛朗哥曾被梵蒂岗誉为“天主教会的忠诚之子”，这位“天主教会的忠诚之子”正是于斌的学习榜样。
    其实于斌更崇拜比佛朗哥高一筹的墨索里尼。当墨索里尼在意大利取得政权，被教皇庇护十一世称做：“这是神赐给我们的人”的时候，于斌正在罗马，充当教皇的忠实走卒。墨索里尼侵占阿比西尼亚之前，教皇曾派出“阿比西尼亚考察团”，进行阴谋活动。于斌就是这个考察团团员之一。墨索里尼并吞了阿比西尼亚，教皇说这是“基于高度博爱的传布文明的使命”。当然于斌对于这一“传布文明的使命”是极其钦佩的。一九三三年，于斌为考得法西斯蒂政治博士，曾在罗马写了一篇论文，对墨索里尼大加赞扬，说墨索里尼是“世界的救星”，是天主教会“唯一的功臣”。一九三二年于斌为了表示其对墨索里尼的爱戴，曾组织了“中意友善会”，自为副会长，竭力宣扬法西斯主义。因为于斌这样热心法西斯主义，一九三三年意皇特别颁给他一枚法西斯勋章和爵士头衔。从此于斌的身价增高了，教皇也很赏识他，一九三三年派他为“中华全国公教进行会”总监督，并兼任教廷驻华代表公署秘书。第四年——一九三六年七月七日这位法西斯爵士就被教皇提升为南京区主教了。
    于斌在罗马的时候，就一直和蒋介石集团保持着密切的联系。孔祥熙就是于斌的“最好的朋友”。在蒋介石进行十年反人民的内战时期，于斌始终帮助蒋介石，反对中国人民。
    抗日战争爆发，南京失陷，于斌紧忙逃到国外，并在国外发表了一篇“告欧美人士书”，书中无耻地说道：“剿共费时十年，惟其因共产党危及整个国家，此种绝不妥协之方法，始可称正胥。”那时候，中国共产党正领导着全中国人民团结一致，流血奋斗，英勇抵抗日本帝国主义。但是这个墨索里尼的忠实信徒却大叫其“剿共”“始可称正胥”，他主张进攻中国共产党和中国人民，他反对中国人民抗战，他曾嗾使蔡宁主教留在北平，和日本帝国主义保持密切合作，当时天主教出版的“教务年鉴”就曾公开承认伪满洲国和伪南京政府。
    在抗日战争时期，于斌又积极进行反共反人民的特务工作：在纽约他创办英文中国月报，诬蔑中国共产党；并在华盛顿开设“中国文化学院”。这个“中国文化学院”是个什么组织呢？甚至于斌的同伙——战犯胡适也不得不承认：“它非学院，又无文化，更说不上中国文化。”这个“无文化”的学院就是反共反人民的特务机关。一九四一年底，于斌又在重庆蒋匪统治区域内，策动各地神父组织“天主教文化协进会”，自任理事长。这个“天主教文化协进会”和ｃ.ｃ.特务系统有着密切的关系，是于斌进行特务活动的大本营。香港华商报在一九四九年七月十二日曾揭露了这个组织的罪恶事实。
    抗日战争刚刚胜利，于斌就赶快从梵蒂岗回国，带回教皇赠给蒋匪的亲笔签名照片，蒋介石经过戴笠之手一次付给于斌两万万伪币，让于斌在南京、上海、北平、天津、重庆、西安六大城市办益世报。同时于斌又在南京成立“天主教文化协进会”，企图在全国一百三十个教区成立分会，并准备在全国二十五个大都市出版益世报。于斌就利用这些宗教的文化的机构，协助蒋匪，反对中国人民。
    第二次世界大战胜利之后，美帝国主义完全控制了梵蒂岗，企图利用天主教推行其侵略政策。于斌就成了美帝国主义侵略中国最忠实的走狗之一。教皇自然也很宠爱这个忠实走狗。于是，于斌被教皇提升为南京总主教。一九四七年元旦于斌举行就任总主教之职的典礼时，教廷公使黎培理公然宣称：天主教要辅助蒋介石匪帮的建国工作（依靠美帝国主义，进攻中国人民）。
    于斌怎样辅助蒋介石匪帮进攻中国人民呢？当蒋介石匪帮疯狂地发动内战的时候，于斌披着宗教外衣，在东北、华北和华南等地作政治旅行，到处发表反动的言论，侮蔑中国共产党和中国人民，以配合蒋匪进攻解放区。一九四六年他在广州作了四次可耻的演说，有一次，他对广州新闻记者造谣说：“东北……共军到后，大肆抢劫，若干城市被共军纵火焚烧，成为灰烬；惟在国军（蒋匪军）收复区内，呈欣欣向荣景象。”一九四七年初他卑鄙地自造了“东北民众代表团”的名义，请求蒋匪迅速“收复”东北各地。他又在幕后指挥东北特务工作，破坏中国解放区。中国人民解放军英勇奋斗，不断击溃了美帝国主义支援的蒋匪军的进攻。于斌眼看中国人民解放军的强大无敌，曾企图在美帝国主义驻蒋匪军事顾问团支持之下，组织“天主教反共十字军”，准备在华北成立五个军，来支援蒋匪。但是这个企图没有实现，于斌非常伤心，他只好去向美帝国主义者求援。在人民解放战争中，他曾两次会见杜鲁门，“力争美援”。一九四八年他在伪参政会驻委会报告访美观感，他说杜鲁门曾经向他保证：“美国纵在极困难情况下，必须积极而彻底援蒋”。同时，他又吸收各地学生，扩大其特务组织。他早就和曾在山西传教的基督教士——美国反动议员周以德吸收一批中学生赴美留学，加以特务训练。
    尽管美帝国主义“积极而彻底援蒋”，尽管于斌之流怎样进行特务工作，中国人民解放战争终于胜利了，法西斯爵士、美帝国主义走狗于斌也终于露出了他的狐狸原形，跑到美国，以华盛顿“中国文化学院”和纽约“英文中国月报”为据点，公开进行特务活动。他又奉美帝国主义之命，以新加坡为中心，组织东南亚反共特务网，加紧进行反人民的罪恶活动。他还指派毛振翔（中国神父）协助臭名远扬的飞贼陈纳德，在一九四九年三月间公开在美国搜罗空军人员，组织“空军志愿军”，帮助蒋匪，轰炸中国人民。一九四九年七月十三日香港华商报载：于斌特务系统正由毛振翔收集一批留美学生中的天主教徒，予以特务训练；同时又由雷振远在香港训练从华北南逃的天主教神父和修士，派回大陆进行破坏活动。
    特务走狗于斌还不断地在阿根廷、智利、秘鲁、墨西哥等国游说，无耻地请求这些国家不要承认中华人民共和国。他又加紧在拉丁美洲替蒋匪及其爪牙找寻藏身之所，他通过教廷驻智利公使蔡宁，要求智利政府，准许四大家族把他们几十年来从中国人民身上搜刮来的资金窝藏于智利。
    走狗们仇恨中国人民的凶恶心肠是相同的，去年于斌和胡适勾搭起来，在美国建立了“自由中国”、“真福会”等组织，以进行其反对中国人民的勾当。美帝国主义者也看中了这两堆垃圾，认为他们两个是唯一可以组织“第三种势力”的人。美帝国主义还想利用这两条走狗来欺骗中国人民，继续危害中国人民。
    中国人民和中国爱国的天主教徒早已识破了于斌的狐狸面孔。法西斯爵士、美蒋匪帮的重要帮凶于斌就是当年耶稣所说的“外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼”。于斌不但是中国人民所要逮捕的战犯，而且也是中国天主教徒们所要清除的“残暴的狼”。每一个热爱祖国的天主教徒是和于斌誓不两立的。爱国的天主教徒在自立革新运动中，坚决表示要肃清教会中的反革命分子，割断和美帝国主义的联系，是应该而且必要的，是受到中国人民热烈欢迎的。中国人民和爱国的天主教徒所切齿痛恨的于斌，是一定会受到中国人民的审判的。
