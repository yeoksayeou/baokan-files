Wuhan Factories Achieve Success in Anti-American and Aid-Korea Literary and Art Activities

In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, factories in Wuhan have generally established amateur cultural and art troupes or drama groups, waist drum teams, singing teams, fine arts groups, and other literary and artistic organizations. In terms of drama creation, according to extremely incomplete statistics, in two months, factories have produced more than 50 new scripts centered on exposing the crimes of American imperialism and resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, and launching patriotic production competitions. Some factories, due to busy production schedules, were unable to organize evening parties, but they used morning break times to hold workshop lunch meetings and perform various short and concise literary and artistic programs. Factories also widely used wall newspapers, speech contests, and other forms of folk art to carry out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities. Through the education of these literary and artistic propaganda activities, workers in various factories have generally improved their patriotic ideology; the production competition movement has been vigorously launched in various factories.

Hubei Military Region Troops Carry Out Current Affairs Education

Since December of last year, troops in various locations under the Hubei Military Region have widely carried out systematic current affairs education through cadre training and troop rotation training. Over the past two months, through concrete facts and materials, the idea of hating, despising, and scorning American imperialism has been established among the troops, and the peaceful paralysis of thought in the troops has been initially overcome, consolidating the previous achievements of patriotic study and rectification.

Chanan Lacks Long-Term Thinking in Running Farmer Education

A total of 4,234 winter schools have been established in Chahar Province, with 227,553 young and middle-aged men and women enrolled. However, in the development of winter schools, some areas lack long-term thinking on farmer education. Many county leaders in Chanan believe that "learning will end after winter is over," so they do not inspect the work of winter schools. This is incorrect.
