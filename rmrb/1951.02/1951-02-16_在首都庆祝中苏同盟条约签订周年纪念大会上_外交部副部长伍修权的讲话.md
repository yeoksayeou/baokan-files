Comrades, dear friends:

On the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we celebrate the great significance of this treaty with great excitement.

Since the October Socialist Revolution, there has been a deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. However, due to the obstruction of imperialism and the Chinese reactionary government, the friendship between our two countries failed to develop freely and fully for a long time. It was not until the Chinese people achieved historical victory that China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which formally confirmed and consolidated the deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the form of a treaty. The content of this treaty not only expresses the lofty principles of Lenin and Stalin's diplomacy, but also opens up a new era of friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and several agreements between China and the Soviet Union has provided extremely favorable conditions for the construction of New China in political, economic, and other aspects. According to the agreement on Soviet experts coming to China to work, a large number of Soviet experts came to China to serve. With a great spirit of internationalism, they have done their utmost to help us in various aspects of the construction of New China. The great achievements made in the year or so since the founding of the People's Republic of China contain the brilliant efforts of Soviet experts.

Chairman Mao once said: "The unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples is extremely important. If the peoples of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." Now, the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union have been firmly united under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance; the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger and more consolidated.

After the end of World War II, the Soviet Union devoted all its efforts to the rapid development of socialist peaceful construction. In 1949, Soviet industrial production reached 141 percent of the pre-war year of 1940, and in 1950, Soviet industry increased by 23 percent compared with 1949, which shows that the Soviet Union's industrial strength has greatly increased compared with the pre-war period. The Soviet Union has also made great strides in other areas of construction, which has aroused the cheers and congratulations of people all over the world.

The Soviet Union's firm struggle for world peace and human justice has repeatedly dealt serious blows to the imperialist aggression plan, making the world peace and democracy camp stronger day by day. The Soviet Union has become an inviolable fortress of world peace. Marshal Stalin has become the common leader of all peace-loving people.

While the strength of the world peace and democracy camp is growing stronger and more consolidated, the imperialist group headed by US imperialism has not learned any lessons. Instead, in June 1950, it openly launched a war of aggression against Korea and armed occupied China's territory of Taiwan. In order to defend the security of their motherland, the Chinese people launched a broad movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend their homes and the country. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers assisted the Korean people in their war, causing the armies of the United States and its puppet countries to suffer serious defeats on the Korean battlefield, and exposing the US imperialism, a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak, in front of the people of the world.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have defeated the invading army of US imperialism, the leader of the imperialist group, in Korea, and will finally defeat the United States and all foreign invading forces in Korea who refuse to peacefully resolve the issue.

The alliance of the powerful Soviet Union and the powerful China is an invincible alliance. This alliance is the guarantee of world peace and the guarantee of victory in the struggle against imperialist aggression. Let us shout:

Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance!

Long live the unbreakable friendly unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao, the wise leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world!

### 在首都庆祝中苏同盟条约签订周年纪念大会上  外交部副部长伍修权的讲话

　　在首都庆祝中苏同盟条约签订周年纪念大会上         
    外交部副部长伍修权的讲话
    同志们、亲爱的朋友们：
    当中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年的时候，我们以十分兴奋的心情，庆祝这个条约的伟大意义。
    自十月社会主义革命以来，中苏两国人民之间即存在了深厚的友谊，但由于帝国主义和中国反革命政府的阻碍，使我们两国之间的友谊在过去很长的时期，都未能得到自由和充分的发展。直到中国人民取得了历史胜利以后，中苏两国签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，这才以条约的形式确定与巩固了中苏两国人民之间的深厚友谊。这一条约的内容不仅表示了列宁、斯大林外交政策的崇高原则，同时开辟了中苏两国人民之间友好合作的新时代。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约及中苏两国间几个协定的签订，对于新中国的建设，无论是在政治、经济或其他方面都提供了极有利的条件。根据苏联专家到中国来工作的协定，大批苏联专家来到中国服务。他们以伟大的国际主义的精神，竭尽其一切的智能，帮助我们新中国各方面的建设。在中华人民共和国成立一年余来所获得的伟大成就中，是包含着苏联专家们光辉的努力的。
    毛主席曾说：“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”现在，中苏两国七万万的人民，已经在中苏友好同盟互助条约之下，坚固地团结起来了；以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，也就更为强大和巩固了。
    在第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联以全力迅速发展了社会主义的和平建设。一九四九年苏联工业生产已达到战前一九四○年的百分之一百四十一，而一九五○年度，苏联工业又比一九四九年提高百分之二十三，这说明苏联的工业力量比战前大大的增强。苏联在其他建设方面也都得到了突飞猛进的成就，这引起了全世界人民的欢呼与祝贺。
    苏联坚定地为世界和平和人类正义而奋斗，使帝国主义的侵略计划再三地受到严重打击，使世界和平民主阵营一天比一天壮大。苏联已经成为世界和平的不可侵犯的堡垒。斯大林大元帅已经成为全体爱好和平的人类的共同领袖。
    在世界和平民主阵营的力量日益壮大和巩固的时候，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团并没有学到什么教训，反而在一九五○年六月公开发动了侵朝战争，并且武装侵占中国的领土台湾。中国人民为着保卫自己祖国的安全，发起了广泛的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，英勇的中国人民志愿军协助朝鲜人民作战，使美国及其仆从国家的军队在朝鲜战场上遭受了严重的失败，在全世界人民的面前，戳穿了美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，已将帝国主义集团的首领美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略军队打得落花流水，并且还要在朝鲜最后击败拒绝和平解决的美国及一切外国的侵略军队。
    强大的苏联和强大的中国的同盟，是永远不可战胜的同盟，这个同盟是世界和平的保证，是反帝国主义侵略斗争胜利的保证。让我们高呼：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约万岁！
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友好团结万岁！
    中国人民英明的领袖毛主席万岁！
    世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
