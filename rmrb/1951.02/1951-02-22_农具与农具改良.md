Farm Tools and Farm Tool Improvement
　　Xiao Ying

　　Under the oppression and plunder of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, China's rural areas have suffered from an extraordinary shortage of farm tools. On average, 31 percent of the farm tools needed for the country's 1.47 billion mu of arable land are missing. In rural Henan, there are only two plows for every seven households on average. Old plows, which are suitable for cultivating 30 mu of land, have to bear an average of 46 mu, seriously affecting intensive cultivation. Therefore, how to supplement the missing farm tools so that each farm household has enough farm tools available is the primary task of current farm tool work.

　　What kind of farm tools should be supplemented? At present, it is not yet possible to massively supplement tractors and improved farm tools due to limitations in materials, technology, and other conditions. Therefore, the National Farm Tool Conference held in late January stipulated that the guiding principle for farm tool work in 1951 is: "Restore and supplement existing farm tools, with a focus on promoting new farm tools."

　　Last year, through the assistance of central government farm tool loans, a great deal of progress has been made in supplementing existing farm tools. In the past year, farmers in the five provinces of North China have added more than 1.9 million pieces of farm tools, and farm tool loans issued in East China and Northwest China are equivalent to 30 million jin of millet. However, relying solely on government loans is not enough. It is also necessary to organize the strength of the vast number of farmers and rural artisans. In particular, attention should be paid to organizing iron and wood craftsmen in small and medium-sized towns through cooperatives, providing them with funds or supplying raw materials, purchasing finished products, and providing technical guidance within a possible scope to research farm tool improvement work. At the same time, attention should be paid to selecting and promoting the excellent types of farm tools that farmers already have. For example, the "Yuan Yang waterwheel" in the plains is twice as efficient as the ordinary waterwheel for irrigation; the "fan knife" used for harvesting wheat in Henan is more efficient than the sickle. In some places in Hebei, hoes are installed on the feet of seed drills for cultivating. These are all creations of the wisdom of the working people. There is a lack of widespread investigation and research in various places for promotion. In the future, attention should be paid to manufacturing and promoting the original good farm tools in rural areas, and eliminating backward and clumsy old farm tools.

　　As for the promotion of new and improved farm tools, in the past two years, more than a dozen farm tool factories have been established across the country, and more than 20 kinds of new farm tools have been designed and manufactured. Among them, the three types of "walking plows" and "corn threshers" in North China, the "shovel weeder" in Northeast China, and the "wheat harvester" in Northwest China are the most popular among farmers. In the process of manufacturing and promotion, it is first necessary to investigate and understand the needs and farming habits of farmers, and then add scientific design, trial production, and field testing in rural areas, listen to farmers' opinions, improve them, and manufacture them in small quantities for trial use in rural areas in various places, and then improve them again until they are welcomed by farmers before mass production and promotion. At present, the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory is planning to follow the mass line, conduct investigation and research, so as to design a set of new farm tools from land preparation, sowing, irrigation, cultivation to harvesting within one or two years to supply the countryside.

　　Farm tool work is important, but also arduous and heavy. However, under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, this year, various regions should be able to make greater achievements than last year.

　　农具与农具改良
　　萧颖
    我国农村，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压榨劫掠下，造成了农具异常缺乏的现象。全国十四亿七千余万亩耕地所需农具，平均缺少百分之三十一。河南农村平均七户才有犁两张。以负担三十亩耕地为宜的旧犁，平均要负担四十六亩，严重地影响了深耕细作。所以怎样补充缺少的农具，使每户农家有足够的农具可用，是当前农具工作的首要任务。
    补充些什么农具呢？目前即时大量补充拖拉机和改良农具，由于物质、技术等条件所限，尚不可能，因而上月下旬全国农具会议规定了一九五一年农具工作方针是：“恢复与补充原有农具，重点推广新农具”。
    补充原有农具工作，去年各地通过中央农具贷款的扶助，已有不少成绩。华北五省一年来农民添置农具即达一百九十余万件，华东、西北发放的农具贷款折合小米三千万斤。但是，单纯依靠政府贷款是不够的，还须组织广大农民及农村手工业者的力量，尤其是要注意通过合作社组织中小城镇的铁、木工匠，贷给资金，或供给原料，收购成品，并在可能的范围内给以技术指导，研究农具改进工作。同时要注意选择农民原有农具的优良种类加以推广，像平原一带的“鸳鸯轳轴”灌田效率就比普通轳轴高两倍；河南收麦用的“扇刀”就比镰刀效率高。河北某些地方把耧脚上装锄用来中耕。这些都是劳动人民智慧的创造，各地还缺少普遍的调查研究，加以推广，今后应注意制造和推广农村的原有好农具，而淘汰落后的笨拙的旧农具。
    至于新农具和改良农具的推广，两年来，全国各地已建立了十几所农具工厂，设计制造了新式农具二十余种。其中最受农民欢迎的是华北的三种“步犁”及“玉米脱粒机”，东北的“铲趟机”，西北的“小麦收割机”。在制造和推广的过程中，首先要调查了解农民的需要和耕作习惯，然后加上科学的设计，试制，拿到农村试验，听取农民的意见，加以改进，制成后再少量地分到各地农村试用，再改进，直到得到农民的欢迎后才大量制造推广。现在，华北农业机械厂正计划走群众路线，调查研究，以便在一两年内设计一套从整地、播种、灌溉、中耕到收获的新农具，供给农村。
    农具工作是重要的，也是艰苦繁重的，但在中央人民政府农业部的正确领导下，今年各地当能作出比去年更大的成绩来。
