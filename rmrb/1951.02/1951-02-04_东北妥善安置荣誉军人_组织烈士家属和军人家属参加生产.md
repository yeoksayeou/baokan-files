Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Governments in Northeast China have properly resettled honored veterans. The majority of discharged honored veterans throughout the region have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. With the help of local governments and farmers, they have all obtained guarantees in production and life. Many single honored veterans have also mostly married and started families. The Northeast Honored Veterans Work Committee and the People's Governments of various provinces have established eight farms equipped with new agricultural implements and tractors for more than 3,000 single honored veterans in the region. Last year, the farm reclaimed more than 69,000 mu of wasteland and harvested more than 6,000 tons of grain, laying a preliminary foundation for the future construction of "Honored Veterans' New Villages." In addition, some honored veterans have also participated in enterprise management and industrial and mining production. For example, a certain state-owned enterprise selected more than 120 honored veterans to serve as directors, section chiefs, and unit chiefs, and they are all competent in their work.

In order to systematically train a group of honored veteran cadres to become construction talents in the future, the Northeast People's Government has established six regular vocational schools for honored veterans, which have admitted more than 2,200 honored veterans from worker and peasant backgrounds, and provided them with specialized education in financial work and agricultural technology. The students have extremely high enthusiasm for learning, and their cultural level has generally improved to above the higher primary school level, and some students can master certain technologies.

Most of the honored veterans currently distributed in various work positions can maintain and carry forward their original glory, and thus have won the support of the masses in various places. At the labor model representative conferences of honored veterans held in various provinces and cities last winter, many outstanding honored veteran models were rewarded. For example, Wang Zhiliang, an electric pick driver at the Fushun Coal Mine, once promoted the entire team of workers to create a new record of loading 230 carts of coal in eight hours. Song Shiyou, who returned to his hometown in Huanan County, Songjiang Province, to participate in production, can take the lead in demonstrations and promote production in the village in each production season, and has been continuously elected by the masses as a people's representative of the district, county, and province.

Xinhua News Agency report: With the active help of the People's Government and the masses, the families of martyrs and military personnel in various cities in Northeast China have worked hard to participate in production, and their lives are improving day by day. The People's Governments of various cities in Northeast China have organized various production undertakings to absorb the families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production. Shenyang City has organized thirteen factories and cooperatives for the families of martyrs and military personnel in the past year, with 349 people participating in production. In addition, 795 families of martyrs and military personnel have been introduced to jobs by the government. Their income, in addition to food and clothing, still has a surplus, thus reducing the government's relief to them. The number of families of martyrs and military personnel in the city who needed government subsidies in October last year has decreased by 30% compared with March of the same year. More than 95% of the military families with labor force in Fushun City have been introduced by the government to participate in industrial and mining production. More than 1,200 families of martyrs and military personnel in Harbin City have been given priority for employment by various public enterprises and institutions. Eighty percent of the rope-spinning workers in the city's sack factory are families of martyrs and military personnel, and each of them can earn at least wages equivalent to more than 220 jin of sorghum rice per month. In addition to introducing jobs for the families of martyrs and military personnel, the district People's Government of Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, also organizes the elderly and women to engage in production such as spinning and sewing sacks. Small cities such as Shuangcheng, Acheng, Boli in Songjiang Province and Dehui in Jilin Province have also organized families of martyrs and military personnel to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. In the past year, Shuangcheng County organized 131 families of martyrs and military personnel to settle in various villages in the county. Their agricultural tools, housing and other issues were solved by the local government, and they received the same amount of land as the local farmers.

The People's Governments in various places also allocated grain and other items to subsidize some families of martyrs and military personnel who lacked labor force, ensuring that they can live at the same level as the general public. In Heilongjiang Province alone, nearly 4.1 million jin of grain and 13,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes were allocated to poor families of martyrs and military personnel in cities last year.

　　东北妥善安置荣誉军人
    组织烈士家属和军人家属参加生产
    【新华社讯】东北各地人民政府妥善地安置了荣誉军人。全区退伍的荣誉军人，大部已回乡参加农业生产。他们在当地政府与农民的帮助下，都获得了生产上和生活上的保障。许多单身的荣誉军人，也大多成家立业。东北荣誉军人工作委员会及各省人民政府，曾为全境三千余名单身的荣誉军人创办了八处配有新式农具和拖拉机的农场。该农场去年共开垦荒地六万九千余亩，收获粮食六千余吨，为今后建设“荣誉新村”打下了初步基础。此外，部分荣誉军人还参加了企业管理和工矿生产。如某国营企业共选拔了一百二十余名荣誉军人担任处长、科长、股长等，他们在工作上都能胜任。
    东北人民政府为有计划地培养一批荣誉军人干部成为将来的建设人材，特建立了六处正规的荣誉军人职业学校，共吸收了工农出身的两千二百余名荣誉军人，分别给以财政工作及农业技术的专业教育。学员学习热情极高，文化水平已普遍提高到高小以上程度，部分学员且能掌握一定的技术。
    目前分布在各种工作岗位上的荣誉军人，大多能够保持与发扬原来的光荣，因而也博得各地群众的拥护。去冬各省、市召开的荣誉军人劳动模范代表大会上，都奖励了许多成绩突出的荣誉军人模范。如抚顺煤矿电镐司机王志良，曾推动全班工人创造了八小时装煤二百三十车的新纪录。松江省桦南县回乡生产的宋世友，在每个生产季节中，都能带头示范，推动该村生产，接连被群众选为区、县、省的人民代表。
    【新华社讯】在人民政府和群众的积极帮助下，东北各城市的烈士家属和军人家属，努力参加生产，生活日益改善。东北各城市的人民政府都组织了各种生产事业，吸收烈士家属和军人家属们参加生产。沈阳市一年来共组织了十三个烈士和军人家属的工厂和合作社，参加生产的有三百四十九人。此外，并有七百九十五名烈士家属和军人家属，经政府介绍谋得职业。他们的收入，除吃用外尚有裕余，因而就减少了政府对他们的救济。该市去年十月需要政府补助的烈士家属和军人家属已较同年三月减少百分之三十。抚顺市百分之九十五以上有劳动力的军属，都经政府介绍，参加工矿业生产。哈尔滨市已有一千二百余名烈士家属和军人家属，为各公营企业、机关优先录用。该市麻袋工厂中的纺绳工人百分之八十为烈士家属和军人家属，他们每人每月最少可得到折合高粱米二百二十多斤的工薪。松江省双城县区人民政府，除为烈士和军人家属介绍职业外，并组织老年人和妇女从事纺线、缝麻袋等生产。该省双城、阿城、勃利和吉林省德惠等小城市，还组织烈士家属和军人家属到农村去参加农业生产。双城县在去年一年中曾组织一百三十一户烈士家属和军人家属到该县各村安家立业。他们的农具、住房等问题都由当地政府解决，并得到了和当地农民同等数量的土地。
    各地人民政府对于某些缺乏劳动力的烈士家属和军人家属，还拨给粮食及其他物品予以补助，保证他们能过和一般人民同样水平的生活。仅黑龙江省在去年内，即为城市中的贫苦烈士家属和军人家属拨发了近四百一十万斤粮食，一万三千套棉衣。
