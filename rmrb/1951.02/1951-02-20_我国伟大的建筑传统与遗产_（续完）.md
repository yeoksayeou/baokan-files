　　Our Great Architectural Tradition and Heritage (Conclusion)
　　Liang Sicheng
            Our ancestors were equally adept at using brick and stone
    In addition to the existing wooden structures, there are also Han Dynasty stone que and stone shrines, as well as pagodas that are common throughout the country and many amazing stone bridges, which should be briefly introduced.
    Han Dynasty Stone Que and Stone Shrines Que were ancient palace, ancestral temple, and mausoleum gate towers, located on the left and right sides of the path in front. The best-preserved and most exquisite que are the Gao Yi tomb que in Ya'an, Xikang, and the Yang Fujun tomb que in Mianyang, Sichuan. Although they are all stone structures, they are entirely carved in imitation of wooden structures. The Han Dynasty wooden structure styles, including the platform below, the pillars of the que body, the overlapping rafters above, and the overhanging roof, are all expressed with highly skilled and precise techniques. They are all the most precious architectural masterpieces.
    There are also several "stone chambers" in front of Han Dynasty tombs in Jiaxiang County and Feicheng County, Shandong. Although they are all extremely small and simple, they still show the use of pillars, brackets, and beam frames.
    From these Han Dynasty relics, we can see that the unique tradition of Chinese architecture was completely established by the Han Dynasty, and later generations of working people continued to carry it forward until today. These mausoleum buildings are also valuable reference materials for historians and artists to study the Han Dynasty funeral system and art.
    Songyue Temple Brick Pagoda, Mount Song Pagodas have almost become an indispensable element in Chinese scenery. For more than a thousand years, they have given infinite comfort to the hard-working and oppressed people. In the beautiful days of spring and autumn, everyone appreciates them together, vying to climb and look into the distance. There are countless poems about pagodas in the literary heritage.
    Wooden pagodas that were popular in the Tang and Song Dynasties have only one remaining, but many brick and stone pagodas have been preserved. The Songyue Temple Pagoda on Mount Song in Henan, built in 520 AD, is the oldest brick pagoda in the country and also one of the best examples. The pagoda has a twelve-sided plan and is fifteen stories high. These two numbers are special isolated cases in pagodas, because general pagodas have square, hexagonal, or octagonal plans, and the number of stories is at most thirteen. In terms of style, the pagoda has a tall base, a tall body, and then fifteen layers of densely stacked eaves. Each of the twelve corners of the pagoda body is built with an octagonal pillar, and the pillar bases and heads are shaped like lotus petals. The vertical pillars of the pagoda body and the horizontal eaves above constitute lines in different directions; the outline of the entire pagoda is a smooth and gentle parabolic shape, magnificent and beautiful, which is the expression of the highest artistic achievement.
    From countless pagodas across the country, we come to the conclusion that Chinese architecture, even if it is a concept completely imported from India like the pagoda, is basically a product of the Chinese nation in terms of material form, and only shows foreign influences in decorative details. The "futu" (pagoda) described in the Biography of Tao Qian in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty is "with multiple stories below and stacked golden plates above." Multi-story buildings are originally Chinese, which is the pagoda itself, and the golden plate is just the finial above, which is the Indian "stupa." The construction of the pagoda is an excellent crystallization of Chinese culture accepting foreign cultural influences. The pagoda is a product of our development after integrating foreign influences with the original foundation.
    Zhaozhou Bridge China has tens of thousands of bridges, facilitating the transportation of the vast people on countless rivers, or giving many people spiritual pleasure. Many bridges have profound significance in Chinese history. Ba Bridge in Chang'an and Lugou Bridge in Beijing are outstanding examples. But from an engineering technical point of view, the greatest should be the Zhaozhou Bridge, which is known to everyone in the north. It is no accident that the male character in the folk opera "Little Cowherd" asks the female character: "Zhaozhou Bridge, who built it?" Its engineering skills are really amazing.
    This bridge spans the Xiaoshui River in Zhaoxian County, Hebei. The span is more than 37 meters (approximately 122 feet), which is a single-arch bridge. In ancient Chinese bridges, this is the largest arch. However, its greatness lies not only in the large span, but also in the fact that there are two small arches on each side of the large arch. This measure reduces the area of the bridge body's obstruction to water flow during floods and reduces the load on the large arch. It is an incomparably clever creation. This kind of practice only appeared in Europe in 1912 for the first time, but Li Chun, a craftsman of the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD), built such a bridge more than 1,300 years ago. This bridge stands to this day and continues to facilitate the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles. There was an inscription from the Tang Dynasty on the bridge, especially praising the "Sui craftsman Li Chun" for his ingenuity of "drilling four holes on both sides"; inside the small arches of the bridge body, there are also countless inscriptions from the Song, Jin, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, recording the admiration of people of all dynasties for it. The name Li Chun is a name that will never be buried in the history of Chinese engineering. Every bridge engineer should learn from this great and talented engineer who lived 1,300 years ago!
    Suspension Bridges Iron cable bridges and bamboo cable bridges are the most familiar names in the southwestern provinces. In the history of engineering, suspension bridges are another great contribution of our ancestors to the history of human culture. Iron chains were invented by our ancestors, and their wisdom transformed a rigid and stubborn natural material into a soft and useful tool. This great invention was applied very early to connect the barriers of rivers, creating suspension bridges. In addition to iron, we also used local materials, using bamboo ropes as the material for suspension bridges.
    Guanxian Bamboo Cable Bridge The Guanxian Bamboo Cable Bridge in Guanxian County, Sichuan, is as famous as the famous Dujiangyan water conservancy project, and is located in the same place. On the Minjiang River, which is more than 320 meters wide, it connects the people on both sides like a thread, making them merge into one.
    In the turbulent river, brave and wise craftsmen first erected several wooden frames. On both banks of the river, a bridge tower was built, filled with huge stone pebbles. Between the two towers, ten thick bamboo ropes woven from many bamboo strips are pulled in parallel over the wooden frames. The bamboo ropes are covered with planks to form a walking bridge surface. Bamboo ropes are also used as railings on both sides of the bridge surface.
    Most of the suspension bridges in the southwest use iron, but this suspension bridge uses bamboo. Obviously, because of its huge length, the weight and quantity of iron cables have become a problem, while bamboo is a material that is inexhaustible, inexhaustible, and has extremely strong tensile force; and the weight is extremely light. On this point, it once again proves the great wisdom of Chinese craftsmen in using materials well.
            Planned cities have existed since ancient times
    Since the beginning of the feudal society in the early Zhou Dynasty, Chinese cities and towns have had systems. In order to defend against the attacks of neighboring feudal lords, the cities and towns all had square walls. Inside the city, the feudal lord lived in the front center, the market was in the back, and the people's residences were on both sides. There must be a main street facing the city gate. The remaining land was divided into several squares, called "li," which were called "fang" after the Tang Dynasty. The "li" also had walls, with gates opening on all sides, leading to the main street or the alleys between the "li." Each "li" had a manager, called "liren." This kind of planned city reached its highest degree of development in Chang'an during the Sui and Tang Dynasties.
    Chang'an during the Sui and Tang Dynasties was the first to formulate an urban zoning plan. The north of the city center was the palace city, where the emperor lived. Outside the palace city was the imperial city, where all the government offices were located, which was the administrative district of the capital. Outside the imperial city was the capital city, with three gates on each side and nine main streets intersecting north-south and east-west. The land outside the main streets was one "fang" after another. There were two markets in the east and west, and the Qujiang scenery was at the intersection of the main streets and the southeast corner of the city. In this way, the royal palace, administrative area, residential area, commercial area, and scenic area were clearly divided and regulated, and connected by an excellent road system, in an orderly manner. We are the most advanced nation in history in planning and building cities. Since ancient times, "building a country and building a house," that is, urban planning and architecture, have always been mentioned in the same breath.
    Chang'an, Luoyang and many ancient cities of the Sui and Tang Dynasties no longer exist, but Beijing, the capital of the People's China, is an outstanding and typical Chinese city that has been carefully managed through the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, summarizing the experience of urban planning.
    The appearance of Beijing's city walls today is the best example of dialectical development. The most outstanding feature of Beijing's layout is its north-south central axis, which extends for more than seven kilometers from south to north. Monumental buildings stand in its center. From Yongdingmen, south of the outer city, directly into the city, a straight line leads through the entire Forbidden City to the Bell and Drum Towers to its north, which is most clearly seen from the top of Jingshan. No other city in the world has such a grand spirit, able to calmly grasp such a spatial concept. Moreover, no other country has such a majestic and honorable pure yellow glazed tile roof, and vermilion lacquer gilded wooden structures, unambiguously connected palaces and courtyards. The Forbidden City and its hundreds of palaces are a whole that is a unique architectural masterpiece in the world. The distribution of Beijing's street-shaped areas surrounding it is also a unique isolated case of an orderly city. The palace gardens in the middle and west, the Shichahai for civilian entertainment in the north, and Jingshan, full of pine and cypress trees north of the Forbidden City, are all green areas in Beijing. The adjustment of gardens in the city is also a rare and excellent treatment method. Such a city not only did not exist in the Middle Ages all over the world, but even today, using the most advanced urban planning theory, it still maintains the most favorable conditions.
    Such a capital city is the creation of the blood and sweat of the working people of all dynasties. In the past, all the beautiful fruits were enjoyed by the ruling class, but today they have all returned to the people. We love our capital and are most proud of such a precious part of its great architectural heritage.
    In other large cities in China, the complete and harmonious architectural complexes created by the Chinese nation in the past dynasties, their order and integrity have been destroyed by the invasion of imperialism. What remains is fragmented and sporadic, in urgent need of reorganization. In contrast, the complete preservation of Beijing is even more precious. In the past, under unfavorable conditions, many cultural relics and heritage sites were unnecessarily damaged. Today, the people have stood up, and we guarantee to do our best to protect and carry forward everything precious created by our glorious ancestors.

　　我国伟大的建筑传统与遗产  （续完）
　　梁思成
            我们的祖先同样的善用砖石
    在木构的建筑实物外，现存的砖工建筑有汉代的石阙和石祠，还有普遍全国的佛塔和不少惊人的石桥，应该做简单介绍的叙述。
    汉朝的石阙和石祠  阙是古代宫殿，祠庙，陵墓前面甬道两旁分立在左右的两座楼阁形的建筑物。现在保存最好而且最精美的阙莫过于西康雅安的高颐墓阙和四川绵阳的杨府君墓阙。它们虽然都是石造的，全部却模仿木构的形状雕成。汉朝木构的法式，包括下面的平台，阙身的柱子，上面重叠的枋椽，以及出檐的屋顶，都用高度娴熟精确的技术表现出来。它们都是最珍贵的建筑杰作。
    山东嘉祥县和肥城县还有若干汉朝坟墓前的“石室”，它们虽然都极小极简单，但是还可以看出用柱，用斗，和用梁架的表示。
    我们从这几种汉朝的遗物中可以看出中国建筑所特有的传统到了汉朝已经完全确立，以后世世代代的劳动人民继续不断地把它发扬光大，以至今日。这些陵墓的建筑物同时也是史学家和艺术家研究汉代丧葬制度和艺术的珍贵参考资料。
    嵩山嵩岳寺砖塔  佛塔已几乎成了中国风景中一个不可缺少的因素。千余年来，它们给了辛苦勤劳，受尽压迫的广大人民无限的安慰，春秋佳日，人人共赏，争着登临远眺。文学遗产中就有数不清的咏塔的诗。
    唐宋盛行的木塔已经只剩一座了，砖石塔却保存得极多。河南嵩山嵩岳寺塔建于五二○年，是国内最古的砖塔，也是最优秀的一个实例。塔的平面作十二角形，高十五层，这两个数目字在佛塔中是特殊的孤例，因为一般的塔，平面都是四角，六角，或八角形，层数至多仅到十三。这塔在样式的处理上，在一个很高的基座上，是一段高的塔身，再往上是十五层密密重叠的檐。塔身十二角上各砌作一根八角柱，柱础柱头都作莲瓣形。塔身垂直的柱与上面水平的檐层构成不同方向的线路；全塔的轮廓是一道流畅和缓的抛物线形，雄伟而秀丽，是最高艺术造诣的表现。
    由全国无数的塔中，我们得到一个结论，就是中国建筑，即使如佛塔这样完全是从印度输入的观念，在物质体形上却基本的是中华民族的产物，只在雕饰细节上表现外来的影响。后汉书陶谦传所叙述的“浮图”（佛塔）是“下为重楼，上叠金盘”。重楼是中国原有的多层建筑物，是塔的本身，金盘只是上面的刹，就是印度的“窣堵坡”。塔的建筑是中华文化接受外来文化影响的绝好的结晶。塔是我们把外来影响同原有的基础接合后发展出来的产物。
    赵州桥  中国有成千成万的桥梁，在无数的河流上，便利了广大人民的交通，或者给予多少人精神上的愉悦，有许多桥在中国的历史上有着深刻的意义。长安的灞桥，北京的芦沟桥，就是卓越的例子。但从工程的技术上说，最伟大的应是北方无人不晓的赵州桥。如民间歌剧“小放牛”里的男脚色问女的：“赵州桥，什么人修？”绝不是偶然的。它的工程技巧实太惊人了。
    这条桥是跨在河北赵县洨水上的。跨长三十七公尺有余（约十二丈二尺），是一个单孔券桥。在中国古代的桥梁中，这是最大的一个弧券。然而它的伟大不仅在跨度之大，而在大券两端，各背着两个小券的做法。这个措置减少了洪水时桥身对水流的阻碍面积，减少了大券上的荷载，是聪明无比的创举。这种做法在欧洲到一九一二年才初次出现，然而隋朝（公元五八一至六一八年）的匠人李春却在一千三百多年前就建造了这样一道桥。这桥屹立到今天，仍然继续便利着来往的行人和车马。桥上原有唐代的碑文，特别赞扬“隋匠李春”“两涯穿四穴”的智巧；桥身小券内面，还有无数宋金元明以来的铭刻，记载着历代人民对它的惊佩。李春两个字是中国工程史中永远不会埋没的名字，每一位桥梁工程师都应向这位一千三百年前伟大的天才工程师看齐！
    索桥  铁索桥，竹索桥，这些都是西南各省最熟悉的名称。在工程史中，索桥又是我们的祖先对于人类文化史的一个伟大贡献。铁链是我们的祖先发明的，他们的智慧把一种硬直顽固的天然材料改变成了柔软如意的工具。这个伟大的发明，很早就被应用来联系河流的阻隔，创造了索桥。除了用铁之外，我们还就地取材，用竹索作为索桥的材料。
    灌县竹索桥在四川灌县，与著名的水利工程都江堰同样著名，而且在同一地点上的，就是竹索桥。在宽三百二十余公尺的岷江面上，它像一根线那样，把两面的人民联系着，使他们融合成一片。
    在激湍的江流中，勇敢智慧的工匠们先立下若干座木架。在江的两岸，各建桥楼一座，楼内满装巨大的石卵。在两楼之间，经过木架上面，并列牵引十条用许多竹篾编成的粗巨的竹索，竹索上面铺板，成为行走的桥面。桥面两旁也用竹索做成栏杆。
    西南的索桥多数用铁，而这座索桥却用竹。显而易见，因为它巨大的长度，铁索的重量和数量都成了问题，而竹是当地取不尽，用不竭，而又具有极强的张力的材料；重量又是极轻的。在这一点上，又一次证明了中国工匠善于取材的伟大智慧。
            从古就有有计划的城
    自从周初封建社会开始，中国的城邑就有了制度。为了防御邻邑封建主的袭击，城邑都有方形的城廓。城内封建主住在前面当中，后面是市场，两旁是老百姓的住宅。对着城门必有一条大街。其余的土地划分为若干方块，叫做“里”，唐以后称“坊”。里也有围墙，四面开门，通到大街或里与里间的小巷上。每里有一名管理员，叫做“里人”。这种有计划的城市，到了隋唐的长安已达到了最高度的发展。
    隋唐的长安首次制定了城市的分区计划。城内中央的北部是宫城，皇帝住在里面。宫城之外是皇城，所有的衙署都在里面，就是首都的行政区。皇城之外是都城，每面开三个门，有九条大街南北东西的交织着。大街以外的土地就是一个一个的坊。东西各有两个市场，在大街的交叉处，城之东南隅，还有曲江的风景。这样就把皇宫，行政区，住宅区，商业区，风景区明白地划分规定，而用极好的道路系统把它们系起来，条理井然。有计划的建造城市，我们是历史上最先进的民族。古来“营国筑室”，即都市计划与建筑，素来是相提并论的。
    隋唐的长安，洛阳和许多古都市已不存在，但人民中国的首都北京却是经元、明、清三代，总结了都市计划的经验，用心经营出来的卓越的，典型的中国都市。
    北京今日城垣的外貌正是辩证的发展的最好例子。北京在部署上最出色的是它的南北中轴线，由南至北长达七公里余。在它的中心立着一座座纪念性的大建筑物。由外城正南的永定门直穿进城，一线引直，通过整一个紫禁城到它北面的钟楼鼓楼，在景山巅上看得最为清楚。世界上没有第二个城市有这样大的气魄，能够这样从容地掌握这样的一种空间概念。更没有第二个国家有这样以巍峨尊贵的纯色黄琉璃瓦顶，朱漆描金的木构建筑物，毫不含糊的连属组合起来的宫殿与宫庭。紫禁城和内中成百座的宫殿是世界绝无仅有的建筑杰作的一个整体。环绕着它的北京的街型区域的分配也是有条不紊的城市的奇异的孤例。当中偏西的宫苑，偏北的平民娱乐的十刹海，禁城北面满是松柏的景山，都是北京的绿色区。在城内有园林的调剂也是不可多得的优良的处理方法。这样的都市不但在全世界里中古时代所没有，即在现代，用最进步的都市计划理论配合，仍然是保持着最有利条件的。
    这样一个京城是历代劳动人民血汗的创造，从前一切优美的果实都归统治阶级享受，今天却都回到人民手中来了。我们爱自己的首都，也最骄傲它中间这么珍贵的一份伟大的建筑遗产。
    在中国的其他大城市里，完整而调和的，中华民族历代所创造的建筑群，它们的秩序和完整性已被帝国主义的侵入破坏了。保留下来的已都是残破零星，急待整理的。相形之下北京保存的完整更是极可宝贵的。过去在不利的条件下，许多文物遗产都不必要的受到损害。今天的人民已经站起来了，我们保证尽最大的能力来保护我们光荣的祖先所创造出来可珍贵的一切并加以发扬光大。
