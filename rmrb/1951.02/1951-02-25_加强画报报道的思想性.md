Strengthening the Ideological Nature of Pictorial Reporting
    Zhao Binying
    If newsreels, as patriotic propaganda films, differ from artistic films in their methods of expression, then I believe that monthly pictorials, with the same propaganda purpose, should also differ from newspapers in their reporting methods. Otherwise, pictorials will fall into a state of merely being news photos. This cannot satisfy the broad readership, because readers get nothing more than incomplete images of news they have already read. Moreover, as a monthly publication, it is impossible to fully illustrate each month's news with photos, let alone achieve timeliness.
    Some people believe that the difference between pictorials and newspapers lies in the target audience: "Pictorials are for people with low levels of education." However, in reality, a news item can only capture one or two shots, and it cannot, like a film, explain an entire news item from beginning to end without textual explanation. Then, the idea that "pictorials are for people with low levels of education" loses its basic meaning. People with low levels of education cannot fully understand the news from photos without reading the text.
    However, the reporting methods of Soviet social and political pictorials are worth learning from. In addition to reporting current affairs news on the first and last few pages of each issue, they also carry out daily ideological education that both aligns with current political tasks and leaves a deep impression on readers. For example, under the title "This is what Scottish Miners Saw with Their Own Eyes" (see April 1950 issue of "USSR" pictorial), through the fact that Scottish miners visited the Soviet Union and through their travelogues, the pictorial fully reflected the advanced Soviet coal mining industry, the excellent working conditions of the workers, and their happy lives. This easily makes people think of the extremely different treatment that Soviet miners and miners in capitalist countries receive. Another example is "A Bricklayer" (July 1950 issue of "USSR" pictorial), and "A Worker Family's Income and Expenditure" (May 1950 issue of "USSR" pictorial), which essentially reflect the happy lives of working people in the Soviet Union. Another example is "When Ten Years Have Passed" (April 1950 issue of "USSR" pictorial), which reflects the Soviet Union's education cause and the bright future of Soviet youth. Countless examples like these exist. The profound ideological and educational role played by these contents cannot be compared with news reports in daily newspapers about Scottish miners visiting the Soviet Union, the comprehensive improvement of Soviet workers' lives, or statistical news about Soviet youth receiving education. This approach takes fresh things in daily life that have ideological and educational significance, and makes them even more profound through artistic processing and refinement. As a result, it can arouse people's love for the motherland and for the Soviet system, because it essentially and comprehensively reflects the lives of the Soviet people.
    At the same time, this undoubtedly strengthens the continuity between each photo under a title and strengthens its narrative quality. Therefore, it is also helpful for people with low levels of education.
    The anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement is surging throughout the country, and patriotic ideological education is undoubtedly something we should focus on publicizing. In addition to using current affairs news photos to expose the atrocities of American imperialism and eliminate the misconception of "American civilization," I believe that, like Soviet pictorials, continuously reflecting the fundamental changes in the lives of the liberated Chinese people and the great achievements of peaceful construction over the past year through concrete things, in a concentrated and comprehensive way, will not only increase readers' national self-esteem and confidence, but will also awaken people's love for their good lives, and naturally lead them to associate these good days with the fact that they can only sprout and flourish in the new China under the people's democratic dictatorship, thus arousing love for the motherland!
    Of course, doing so requires strengthening the planning of editorial work, breaking the "convenient" idea of simply turning news into photos, and developing the habit of thinking more.
    More deeply and essentially combining current political tasks to strengthen the ideological and artistic nature of pictorial reporting is a lesson I learned from reading Soviet social and political pictorials.

　　加强画报报道的思想性
    赵斌英
    假如同是作为爱国主义宣传的新闻电影片，和艺术影片之间在表现方法上有所区别的话，那么我认为作为同一宣传目的的月刊画报，和报纸在报道方法上也应有所区别。否则画报就会陷于这样一个状态：把新闻照片化而已。而这样是不能满足广大读者的要求的，因为读者除了对已读过的新闻得到一些不完全的形象而外，得不到更多新鲜的东西。同时，作为一个月刊也决作不到把每月的新闻都用照片作充分说明，更作不到新闻的及时性。
    有些人认为画报和报纸的区别在于读者对象，“画报是给文化低的人看的。”然而，事实上也许一条新闻只能摄取一两个镜头，它不能像电影似地把一件新闻从头到尾不用文字解说。那么“画报是给文化低的人看的”，就失去了它的基本意义。文化低的人不会不看文字就能从照片中完全了解这条新闻。
    而苏联的社会政治画报的报道方式却是值得我们学习的。他们在每期画报前几页和末几页作了时事新闻报道以外，它更作了既配合当前政治任务，而又能使读者得到深刻印象的日常的思想教育工作。比如它用“这是苏格兰矿工亲眼看见的”为题（见五○年四月号《苏联》画报），通过苏格兰矿工至苏联参观这一事实，通过他们的参观记，充分地反映了苏联先进的煤矿工业，工人优良的劳动条件和幸福的生活。这就不难使人联想到苏联矿工和资本主义国家矿工所受到的极端不同的待遇。又如以“一个泥瓦匠”（五○年七月号“苏联”画报），以“一个工人家庭的收支”为题（五○年五月号《苏联》画报），本质地反映了劳动人民在苏联国家内的幸福生活。又如以“过了十个年头的时候”为题（五○年四月号《苏联》画报），反映了苏联国家的教育事业，和苏维埃青年美好的前途。这样例子举不胜举。而这些内容所起的深刻的思想教育作用，就不能与日报上报道苏格兰矿工到苏联参观的新闻，苏联工人生活全面提高的新闻，苏联青年受教育的统计新闻等同日而语。这样作，正是把日常生活中具有思想教育意义的新鲜事物，经过艺术的加工和提炼而更形深刻。其结果可以唤起人民对祖国的热爱，对苏维埃制度的热爱，因为它正是本质地概括地反映了苏联人民的生活。
    同时，这样作无疑地加强了在一个标题之下的每幅照片之间的连续性，加强了它的故事性。因此对文化低的人也有了帮助。
    抗美援朝的爱国主义运动正在全国范围内澎湃开展，爱国主义思想教育，不容置疑地是我们应该着重宣传的。而除了用时事新闻照片暴露美帝暴行等等去肃清“美国文明”的错误认识之外，我认为像苏联画报那样，把解放了的中国人民生活的根本变化，和一年来和平建设的伟大成就，不断地通过具体事物，集中、概括地反映出来，这样不但会增加读者的民族自尊心和自信心，而且更将唤起人民对自己好日子的热爱，并自然地联想到这美好的日子是只有在人民民主专政的新中国才会萌芽而蓬勃起来，而激发了对祖国的热爱！
    当然这样作就必须加强编辑工作的计划性，就必须打破把新闻照片化的“方便”思想，而养成多加思考的习惯。
    更深入地，本质地结合当前政治任务加强画报报导的思想性和艺术性，是我读苏联社会政治画报得到的一点体会。
