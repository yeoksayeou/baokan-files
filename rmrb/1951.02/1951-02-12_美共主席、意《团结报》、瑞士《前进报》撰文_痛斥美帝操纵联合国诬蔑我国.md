Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 10th: New York Dispatch: The New York Daily Worker published on February 1st an article by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, entitled "Wall Street Provokes Asian War."

　　Foster wrote: The United Nations resolution, forced through by the United States, condemning People's China as an aggressor, is a war resolution. The United States is heading straight for war. Its big capitalist rulers are determined to wage war for four basic reasons. First, they believe that the only way to keep America's huge, over-inflated industry running is through war. Second, they fear that world capitalism is falling apart and believe that only they can save it by taking over everything. Third, they believe that the rising socialist movement throughout the world can only be destroyed by war. Fourth, as the greatest force of monopoly capital, they are recklessly and violently rushing towards a policy of unrestricted imperialist expansion. Their response to the capitalist crisis and their insatiable imperialist ambitions is to rush into a world war, which they believe will make them the undisputed master of a fascist world. All this is the most ridiculous stupidity.

　　American monopoly capitalists are very afraid of peace in Korea, because if that happens, the "war is inevitable" theory they are using will be completely shattered. Peace would calm the current war mania, expose the serious dangers that exist within the United States in the current dictatorial "national emergency," and comprehensively ease the tense international situation. The Wall Street warmongers cannot bear such an utter failure of their war plans, so they forced the United Nations to pass a war resolution against People's China.

　　When the recent United Nations debate began, sentiment in favor of negotiations with peace-loving China was so strong that the United States could not even find countries to jointly propose its aggressor proposal. In the end, it had to come forward alone. Then it began the cold-blooded work of coercing unwilling capitalist governments into submission. The American spokesmen issued shameless and open threats – refusing to supply France with the weapons needed for Indochina, drastically cutting economic aid to Britain, "abandoning Western Europe to the Russians," and cutting off India's desperately needed wheat supply. Even Hitler was not so arrogant in Munich. However, the result it achieved was shameful, and that was all too obvious.

　　Foster pointed out: Wall Street's "victory" in the United Nations will cost the warmongers more. Such unprecedentedly belligerent and barbaric actions cannot escape the eyes of the world. The United Nations' shameful betrayal of peace will undoubtedly further arouse millions of people, making them aware of the serious danger of American imperialism and the threat of war it poses. The war alliance of capitalist countries will be even more shaky than before. It is one thing to drive compliant representatives in the United Nations to participate in the war, but it will be many times more difficult to force the people of the world to go to war.

　　Foster concluded by pointing out: For the most important national interests of the American people, the great task before them is to stop this evil war plan before it leads to irreparable disaster.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 11th: The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" and the Swiss Labor Party's newspaper "Vorwärts" both published articles on February 3rd denouncing U.S. imperialism for forcing the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution slandering our country as a so-called "aggressor."

　　"Unità"'s editorial said: This behavior of the American imperialists shows that they "have no sense of shame. They barbarously trampled on the normal way of discussion in the United Nations with intimidation and pressure. Truman bought votes for his proposal, giving new shame to those countries that depend on the United States." The editorial praised "the Chinese people, who have provided the best evidence of their wisdom and love of peace with their proposals." The editorial concluded: "The American ruling circles must know that they have lost their position among the masses of the people. They alone are the mortal enemies of a peaceful solution to the Korean problem. This fact is becoming clearer and clearer today."

　　"Vorwärts" wrote: "This resolution of the United Nations does not have the support of the people. The fate of peace is in the hands of hundreds of millions of peace-loving ordinary people. The more closely they unite together, the more actively they fight for peace, the greater the hope for peace will be."

　　美共主席、意《团结报》、瑞士《前进报》撰文        
    痛斥美帝操纵联合国诬蔑我国
    【新华社布拉格十日电】纽约讯：纽约工人日报于二月一日刊载美国共产党主席福斯特所作题为《华尔街挑拨亚洲战争》的论文。
    福斯特写道：美国强迫通过的联合国谴责人民中国为侵略者的决议，是一个战争决议。美国正在迳直地走向战争。它的大资本统治者决心进行战争，这有四个基本原因。一、他们认为要保持美国巨大的过分膨胀的工业继续开工，唯一的办法就是战争。二、他们害怕世界资本主义正在分崩离析，认为只有他们来总管一切才能挽救。三、他们认为全世界日益高涨的社会主义运动只有用战争才能摧毁。四、作为最大的垄断资本的力量，他们鲁莽剧烈地奔向无限制的帝国主义扩张的政策。他们对于资本主义危机和他们无餍足的帝国主义野心的感应就是奔向世界大战，他们认为这可以使他们成为一个法西斯世界的无容争辩的主子。这一切都是最荒唐的愚蠢。
    美国垄断资本家们非常害怕朝鲜的和平，因为这样一来，他们所利用的“战争不可避免”的理论就会整个破灭了。和平将会使目前的战争狂平息下去，使目前独裁的“全国紧急状态”中美国内部所存在的严重危险暴露出来，并将使紧张的国际局势全面地和缓下去。华尔街的战争贩子们吃不住他们的战争计划受到这样一种绝对的失败，因此，他们强迫联合国通过了反对人民中国的战争决议。
    当最近联合国的辩论开始时，主张与爱好和平的中国进行谈判的情绪非常强烈，所以，美国甚至找不到一些国家来共同提出它的侵略者提案，最后，它不得不独自出面提出。接着，它便开始进行那冷血的工作，胁迫那些不情愿的资本主义国家政府就范。美国发言人发出了无耻和公开的恐吓——拒绝供给法国为印度支那所需的武器啦，剧烈削减对英国的经济援助啦，“放弃西欧给俄国人”啦，断绝印度所迫切需要的小麦供应啦。即使希特勒在慕尼黑的时候也没有这样蛮横。然而，它取得的结果是可耻的，那是再明显不过的了。
    福斯特指出：华尔街在联合国中的“胜利”，将使战争贩子们付出更多的代价。这样空前好战的蛮横行动，是逃不过全世界的眼睛的。联合国多数这样可耻地出卖和平，无疑将再激起千百万人民，使他们警觉到美帝国主义的严重危险和它所造成的战争威胁。资本主义国家的战争联盟，将会比以往更加动摇不稳。在联合国中驱策顺从的代表参加战争的行动是一回事，但要强使世界人民走向战争就不知更要困难多少倍。
    福斯特最后指出：为了美国人民最重要的国家利益，摆在他们面前的伟大任务，就是趁这个罪恶的战争计划还没有招致不可挽救的灾难之前就制止它。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】意大利共产党机关报《团结报》和瑞士劳工党机关报《前进报》均于二月三日撰论痛斥美帝国主义强使联合国通过诬蔑我国为所谓“侵略者”的非法决议。
    《团结报》社论说：美帝国主义者的这种行径，表明他们“全无羞耻之心。他们用吓诈和压力野蛮地蹂躏了联合国中正常的讨论方式。杜鲁门为他的提案收买赞成票，给那些依赖美国的国家以新的耻辱”。社论赞扬“中国人民，已用他们的建议提供了证明他们的明智与爱好和平的最好的证据”。社论最后说：“美国的统治集团必须知道它们已失去了它们在人民大众之间的地位。只有它们自己才是和平解决朝鲜问题的死敌。这一事实，今天已越来越清楚了。”
    《前进报》写道：“联合国的这一决议得不到人民的支持。和平的命运掌握在亿万爱好和平的普通人民的手中。他们越紧密地团结在一起，越积极地为和平而斗争，和平的希望也就愈大。”
