        9,500 Additional Sets of Popular Readings for Troops to be Reprinted
    As reported in the fourth issue of this publication, mass reading campaigns are underway. The Xinhua Bookstore General Branch has recently re-selected a number of popular readings suitable for soldiers and supplied them to the libraries of various military units. The bookstore has already ordered 5,000 sets from publishers and another 4,500 sets on behalf of the East China region. It is currently in contact with relevant authorities to discuss distribution methods.
        "Reference Materials on Cultural Relics" to be Publicly Distributed
    The "Reference Materials on Cultural Relics," compiled and printed by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, has already published twelve issues. The main purpose of this publication is to report on the situation of national cultural relic excavation, collection, and promotion, to exchange the working experience of museums and libraries in various places, and to study policies and business. Such a publication is very necessary to assist in the work of libraries, cultural centers, museums, and other related cultural relic institutions. The twelfth issue of the journal contains a catalog of 1,200 items of books and paintings from past dynasties looted from the Forbidden City by the puppet Manchukuo Emperor Puyi. Most of these books and paintings have been lost, and this catalog is worth the attention of those who care about and cherish national cultural relics. The journal was originally distributed as gifts and for exchange, but it will be publicly distributed in the future, and readers are currently being asked for their opinions on improving the journal.
            Reflecting the Patriotic Labor Emulation of the Working Class
    The sixth issue of the "Labor Bulletin," published in January, focused on the patriotic labor emulation of the working class and introduced the situation, experience, and methods of workers' patriotic emulation in some areas of Northeast China and Central and Southern China. It also praised the victory of the national textile workers in increasing the production of 20-count yarn in order to stabilize prices and markets. The patriotic labor emulation of the working class should be a regular occurrence, and in fact, it has increasingly become a decisive factor in national economic construction. Local newspapers and periodicals should fully reflect this situation and exchange experiences and methods in a timely manner, in order to promote national construction more rapidly.
    Strengthening the work of employee education has a significant meaning for developing the working capacity of the working class. Liu Ziju's article "The Current Development of Employee Spare-Time Education and Existing Problems" published in this issue of the "Labor Bulletin" is also worth noting.
            Characteristics of the Northeast "Propagandist's Handbook"
    Recently, many local publications suitable for local characteristics and current affairs propaganda have been published across the country, which have played a great role in helping people learn about current affairs and helping propagandists to carry out propaganda work. The "Propagandist's Handbook," published every ten days by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore, is one of the more successfully compiled ones. First, it can combine propaganda with actual work such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and production; second, it tries to use examples, real people, and real events as much as possible, writing in a specific and lively way with great appeal; third, the language is popular, using local dialects and the oral language of workers and peasants appropriately, making it easy for propagandists to adopt it for oral lectures; fourth, it is accompanied by illustrations to increase the strength of propaganda. However, the lines of illustrations and maps expressing political significance are still not clear enough.
    Other similar publications have also been published in many places, such as the Northwest Xinhua Bookstore's "Propagandist's Handbook," the Central and Southern People's Publishing House's "Propagandist," the "Propagandist's Handbook" compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Suiyuan Provincial Committee, and the "Propaganda Handbook" published by the Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore.
            "China Finance" Discusses Currency Management Issues
    The currency management system implemented by the Central People's Government, which concentrates the clearing of major national material allocation through the National Bank, has great significance for national economic construction. The fourth issue of the first volume of the Beijing "China Finance" magazine published the following five articles: Wang Lan's "The Significance and Role of Currency Management," He Qi's "The Centralization of Short-Term Credit," Liu Wanzheng's "Answering Readers' Questions on the Issue of Appropriation and Clearing," and Zeng Xiangwen's "Explaining Several Issues Concerning Basic Construction Investment." Another article introduces the Soviet Union's experience in basic construction investment. In addition to this issue, issues one, two, and three also published articles on currency management issues. These articles are helpful for studying and understanding this overall financial issue.

　　出版动态
            部队通俗读物续印九千五百套
    关于群众读书运动的展开，本刊第四期已有报道。新华书店总店最近又重选了一部分适合士兵阅读的通俗读物，供应各部队图书室的需要。该店已向出版家定印了五千套，又代华东区定印了四千五百套。现正与各有关机关联系，研究分配办法。
            《文物参考资料》将公开发行
    中央人民政府文化部文物局编印的《文物参考资料》，已经出版了十二期。该刊的主旨在报道全国文物发掘、搜集、推广工作的情况，交流各地博物馆、图书馆的工作经验，和研究政策、业务。为协助做好图书馆、文化馆、博物馆及其他有关文物的工作，这样的刊物是很需要的。该刊第十二期载有伪满溥仪从故宫劫去的历代书籍书画目录一千二百项，这些书籍书画大部已经佚亡，这个目录值得关心和爱护国家文物的人注意。该刊原属赠送交换性质，以后将公开发行，现正在征求读者对该刊改进的意见。
            反映工人阶级爱国主义劳动竞赛
    一月份出版的《劳动公报》第六期，以工人阶级的爱国主义劳动竞赛为中心，介绍了东北、中南一些地方的工人爱国主义竞赛的情况、经验和方法。又表扬了全国纺织工人突击增产二十支纱，保持物价市场的稳定的胜利。工人阶级的爱国主义劳动竞赛，应该是经常的，事实上，它已日益成为国家经济建设中经常起决定作用的因素了。各地报纸期刊应该充分反映这种情况，及时交流经验和方法，借以推动国家建设更迅速地前进。
    加强职工教育的工作在发扬工人阶级劳动能力上有重大的意义，本期《劳动公报》发表了刘子久同志的《目前职工业余教育的发展概况及存在着的问题》一文，也颇值得注意。
            东北《宣传员手册》的特点
    最近全国各地方刊行了不少适合地方特点的时事宣传刊物，对于帮助各地人民学习时事和帮助宣传员进行宣传工作，都起了很大的作用。东北新华书店出的《宣传员手册》旬刊，是其中编得相当成功的一种。第一，它能够结合抗美援朝生产、等实际工作来进行宣传；第二，尽量运用实例实人实事，写得具体活泼，感染力大；第三，文字通俗，恰当的运用地方话和工农人民的口语，便于宣传员采用作口头讲授；第四，配合插图，增加宣传力量。但插图和表示政治意义的地图线条还嫌不够清楚。
    其他各地出版类似刊物也已有了不少，例如西北新华书店的《宣传员手册》。中南人民出版社出版的《宣传员》。绥远省委宣传部编印的《宣传员手册》，天津知识书店出的《宣传手册》等。
            《中国金融》讨论货币管理问题
    中央人民政府决定实施的货币管理制度，使全国主要物资调拨都由国家银行集中清算，这一措施对国家经济建设有着巨大意义。北京《中国金融》杂志一卷四期，发表了如下五篇文章：王兰的《货币管理的意义和作用》、贺琦的《短期信用的集中》、刘万铮的《关于划拨清算问题答读者问》、曾祥文的《解释有关基本建设投资的几个问题》。另一篇是介绍苏联基本建设投资的经验的。除本期外，一、二、三期也都刊登有关于货币管理问题的文章。这些文章，对研究和了解这个关系全局的金融问题是有帮助的。
