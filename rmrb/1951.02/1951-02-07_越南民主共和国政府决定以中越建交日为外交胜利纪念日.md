Xinhua News Agency, 5th—My Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram on January 23rd from the Representative Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in our country, forwarding a telegram from Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hoang Minh Giam, to Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Zhou Enlai, on January 15th of this year, stating that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to designate January 18th—the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam—as the Day of Diplomatic Victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The original telegram is as follows:

To Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

On January 18, 1950, the Government of the People's Republic of China recognized the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Subsequently, the governments of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern and Central Europe also successively recognized our government. This demonstrates the profound sympathy of the socialist countries and the People's Democratic countries for the government and people of Vietnam, which is a great honor for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

I am honored to inform you that our government has decided to designate January 18th as the Day of Diplomatic Victory—a day of national celebration in Vietnam. I hereby request you to convey the heartfelt gratitude of the Vietnamese government and people to the Chinese government and people.

\t\t\t\tMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hoang Minh Giam
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 15, 1951
